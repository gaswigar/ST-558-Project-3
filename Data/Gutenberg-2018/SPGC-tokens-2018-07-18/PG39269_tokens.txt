preface
to
the
edition
of
winterslow
is
a
village
of
wiltshire
between
salisbury
and
andover
where
my
father
during
a
considerable
portion
of
his
life
spent
several
months
of
each
year
latterly
at
an
ancient
inn
on
the
great
western
road
called
winterslow
hut
one
of
his
chief
attractions
hither
were
the
noble
woods
of
tytherleigh
or
tudorleigh
round
norman
court
the
seat
of
baring
wall
whose
proffered
kindness
to
my
father
on
a
critical
occasion
was
thoroughly
appreciated
by
the
very
sensitiveness
which
declined
its
acceptance
and
will
always
be
gratefully
remembered
by
myself
another
feature
was
clarendon
wood
whence
the
noble
family
of
clarendon
derived
their
title
famous
besides
for
the
constitutions
signed
in
the
palace
which
once
rose
proudly
amongst
its
stately
trees
but
of
which
scarce
a
vestige
remains
in
another
direction
within
easy
distance
gloams
stonehenge
visited
by
my
father
less
perhaps
for
its
historical
associations
than
for
its
appeal
to
the
imagination
the
upright
stones
seeming
in
the
dim
twilight
or
in
the
drizzling
mist
almost
continuous
in
the
locality
so
many
moaning
over
the
past
and
over
their
brethren
prostrate
about
them
at
no
great
distance
in
another
direction
are
the
fine
pictures
of
lord
radnor
and
somewhat
further
those
of
wilton
house
but
the
chief
happiness
was
the
thorough
quiet
of
the
place
the
sole
interruption
of
which
was
the
passage
to
and
fro
of
the
london
mails
the
hut
stands
in
a
valley
equidistant
about
a
mile
from
two
tolerably
high
hills
at
the
summit
of
which
on
their
approach
either
way
the
guards
used
to
blow
forth
their
admonition
to
the
hostler
the
sound
coming
through
the
clear
pure
air
was
another
agreeable
feature
in
the
day
reminiscentiary
of
the
great
city
that
my
father
so
loved
and
so
loathed
in
olden
times
when
we
lived
in
the
village
itself
a
mile
up
the
hill
opposite
behind
the
hut
salisbury
plain
stretches
away
mile
after
mile
of
open
space
the
reminiscence
of
the
metropolis
would
be
from
time
to
time
furnished
in
the
pleasantest
of
ways
by
the
presence
of
some
london
friends
among
these
dearly
loved
and
honoured
there
as
everywhere
else
charles
and
mary
lamb
paid
us
frequent
visits
rambling
about
all
the
time
thorough
londoners
in
a
thoroughly
country
place
delighted
and
wondering
and
wondered
at
for
such
reasons
and
for
the
other
reason
which
i
mention
incidentally
that
winterslow
is
my
own
native
place
i
have
given
its
name
to
this
collection
of
and
characters
written
there
as
indeed
practically
were
very
many
of
his
works
for
it
was
there
that
most
of
his
thinking
was

i
my
first
acquaintance
with
poets
my
father
was
a
dissenting
minister
at
wem
in
shropshire
and
in
the
year
the
figures
that
compose
the
date
are
to
me
like
the
name
of
demogorgon
coleridge
came
to
shrewsbury
to
succeed
rowe
in
the
spiritual
charge
of
a
unitarian
congregation
there
he
did
not
come
till
late
on
the
saturday
afternoon
before
he
was
to
preach
and
rowe
who
himself
went
down
to
the
coach
in
a
state
of
anxiety
and
expectation
to
look
for
the
arrival
of
his
successor
could
find
no
one
at
all
answering
the
description
but
a
man
in
a
short
black
coat
like
a
which
hardly
seemed
to
have
been
made
for
him
but
who
seemed
to
be
talking
at
a
great
rate
to
his
fellow
passengers
rowe
had
scarce
returned
to
give
an
account
of
his
disappointment
when
the
man
in
black
entered
and
dissipated
all
doubts
on
the
subject
by
beginning
to
talk
he
did
not
cease
while
he
stayed
nor
has
he
since
that
i
know
of
he
held
the
good
town
of
shrewsbury
in
delightful
suspense
for
three
weeks
that
he
remained
there
the
like
an
eagle
in
a
and
the
welch
mountains
that
skirt
the
horizon
with
their
tempestuous
confusion
agree
to
have
heard
no
such
mystic
sounds
since
the
days
of
hoel
harp
or
soft
llewellyn
lay
as
we
passed
along
between
wem
and
shrewsbury
and
i
eyed
their
blue
tops
seen
through
the
wintry
branches
or
the
red
rustling
leaves
of
the
sturdy
by
the
a
sound
was
in
my
ears
as
of
a
syren
song
i
was
stunned
startled
with
it
as
from
deep
sleep
but
i
had
no
notion
then
that
i
should
ever
be
able
to
express
my
admiration
to
others
in
motley
imagery
or
quaint
allusion
till
the
light
of
his
genius
shone
into
my
soul
like
the
sun
rays
glittering
in
the
puddles
of
the
road
i
was
at
that
time
dumb
inarticulate
helpless
like
a
worm
by
the
crushed
bleeding
lifeless
but
now
bursting
the
deadly
bands
that
bound
them
styx
nine
times
round
them
my
ideas
float
on
winged
words
and
as
they
expand
their
plumes
catch
the
golden
light
of
other
years
my
soul
has
indeed
remained
in
its
original
bondage
dark
obscure
with
longings
infinite
and
unsatisfied
my
heart
shut
up
in
the
of
this
rude
clay
has
never
found
nor
will
it
ever
find
a
heart
to
speak
to
but
that
my
understanding
also
did
not
remain
dumb
and
brutish
or
at
length
found
a
language
to
express
itself
i
owe
to
coleridge
but
this
is
not
to
my
purpose
my
father
lived
ten
miles
from
shrewsbury
and
was
in
the
habit
of
exchanging
visits
with
rowe
and
with
jenkins
of
whitchurch
nine
miles
farther
on
according
to
the
custom
of
dissenting
ministers
in
each
other
neighbourhood
a
line
of
communication
is
thus
established
by
which
the
flame
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
is
kept
alive
and
nourishes
its
smouldering
fire
unquenchable
like
the
fires
in
the
of
æschylus
placed
at
different
stations
that
waited
for
ten
long
years
to
announce
with
their
blazing
pyramids
the
destruction
of
troy
coleridge
had
agreed
to
come
over
and
see
my
father
according
to
the
courtesy
of
the
country
as
probable
successor
but
in
the
meantime
i
had
gone
to
hear
him
preach
the
sunday
after
his
arrival
a
poet
and
a
philosopher
getting
up
into
a
unitarian
pulpit
to
preach
the
gospel
was
a
romance
in
these
degenerate
days
a
sort
of
revival
of
the
primitive
spirit
of
christianity
which
was
not
to
be
resisted
it
was
in
january
of
that
i
rose
one
morning
before
daylight
to
walk
ten
miles
in
the
mud
to
hear
this
celebrated
person
preach
never
the
longest
day
i
have
to
live
shall
i
have
such
another
walk
as
this
cold
raw
comfortless
one
in
the
winter
of
the
year

when
i
got
there
the
organ
was
playing
the
psalm
and
when
it
was
done
coleridge
rose
and
gave
out
his
text
he
went
up
into
the
mountain
to
pray
himself
alone
as
he
gave
out
this
text
his
voice
like
a
steam
of
rich
distilled
perfumes
and
when
he
came
to
the
two
last
words
which
he
pronounced
loud
deep
and
distinct
it
seemed
to
me
who
was
then
young
as
if
the
sounds
had
echoed
from
the
bottom
of
the
human
heart
and
as
if
that
prayer
might
have
floated
in
solemn
silence
through
the
universe
the
idea
of
john
came
into
my
mind
one
crying
in
the
wilderness
who
had
his
loins
girt
about
and
whose
food
was
locusts
and
wild
honey
the
preacher
then
launched
into
his
subject
like
an
eagle
dallying
with
the
wind
the
sermon
was
upon
peace
and
war
upon
church
and
state
not
their
alliance
but
their
separation
on
the
spirit
of
the
world
and
the
spirit
of
christianity
not
as
the
same
but
as
opposed
to
one
another
he
talked
of
those
who
had
the
cross
of
christ
on
banners
dripping
with
human
gore
he
made
a
poetical
and
pastoral
excursion
and
to
show
the
fatal
effects
of
war
drew
a
striking
contrast
between
the
simple
driving
his
team
afield
or
sitting
under
the
hawthorn
piping
to
his
flock
though
he
should
never
be
old
and
the
same
poor
country
lad
crimped
kidnapped
brought
into
town
made
drunk
at
an
alehouse
turned
into
a
wretched
with
his
hair
sticking
on
end
with
powder
and
pomatum
a
long
cue
at
his
back
and
tricked
out
in
the
loathsome
finery
of
the
profession
of
blood
were
the
notes
our
poet
sung
and
for
myself
i
could
not
have
been
more
delighted
if
i
had
heard
the
music
of
the
spheres
poetry
and
philosophy
had
met
together
truth
and
genius
had
embraced
under
the
eye
and
with
the
sanction
of
religion
this
was
even
beyond
my
hopes
i
returned
home
well
satisfied
the
sun
that
was
still
labouring
pale
and
wan
through
the
sky
obscured
by
thick
mists
seemed
an
emblem
of
the
and
the
cold
dank
drops
of
dew
that
hung
half
melted
on
the
beard
of
the
thistle
had
something
genial
and
refreshing
in
them
for
there
was
a
spirit
of
hope
and
youth
in
all
nature
that
turned
everything
into
good
the
face
of
nature
had
not
then
the
brand
of
jus
divinum
on
it
to
that
sanguine
flower
inscrib
with
woe
on
the
tuesday
following
the
speaker
came
i
was
called
down
into
the
room
where
he
was
and
went
he
received
me
very
graciously
and
i
listened
for
a
long
time
without
uttering
a
word
i
did
not
suffer
in
his
opinion
by
my
silence
those
two
hours
he
afterwards
was
pleased
to
say
was
conversing
with
william
hazlitt
forehead
his
appearance
was
different
from
what
i
had
anticipated
from
seeing
him
before
at
a
distance
and
in
the
dim
light
of
the
chapel
there
was
to
me
a
strange
wildness
in
his
aspect
a
dusky
obscurity
and
i
thought
him
pitted
with
the
his
complexion
was
at
that
time
clear
and
even
bright
are
the
children
of
yon
azure
sheen
his
forehead
was
broad
and
high
light
as
if
built
of
ivory
with
large
projecting
eyebrows
and
his
eyes
rolling
beneath
them
like
a
sea
with
darkened
lustre
certain
tender
bloom
his
face
a
purple
tinge
as
we
see
it
in
the
pale
thoughtful
complexions
of
the
spanish
murillo
and
valasquez
his
mouth
was
gross
voluptuous
open
eloquent
his
chin
and
round
but
his
nose
the
rudder
of
the
face
the
index
of
the
will
was
small
feeble
nothing
like
what
he
has
done
it
might
seem
that
the
genius
of
his
face
as
from
a
height
surveyed
and
projected
him
with
sufficient
capacity
and
huge
aspiration
into
the
world
unknown
of
thought
and
imagination
with
nothing
to
support
or
guide
his
veering
purpose
as
if
columbus
had
launched
his
adventurous
course
for
the
new
world
in
a
scallop
without
oars
or
compass
so
at
least
i
comment
on
it
after
the
event
coleridge
in
his
person
was
rather
above
the
common
size
inclining
to
the
corpulent
or
like
lord
hamlet
fat
and
pursy
his
hair
now
alas
grey
was
then
black
and
glossy
as
the
raven
and
fell
in
smooth
masses
over
his
forehead
this
long
pendulous
hair
is
peculiar
to
enthusiasts
to
those
whose
minds
tend
heavenward
and
is
traditionally
inseparable
though
of
a
different
colour
from
the
pictures
of
christ
it
ought
to
belong
as
a
character
to
all
who
preach
and
coleridge
was
at
that
time
one
of
those
it
was
curious
to
observe
the
contrast
between
him
and
my
father
who
was
a
veteran
in
the
cause
and
then
declining
into
the
vale
of
years
he
had
been
a
poor
irish
lad
carefully
brought
up
by
his
parents
and
sent
to
the
university
of
glasgow
where
he
studied
under
adam
smith
to
prepare
him
for
his
future
destination
it
was
his
proudest
wish
to
see
her
son
a
dissenting
minister
so
if
we
look
back
to
past
generations
as
far
as
eye
can
reach
we
see
the
same
hopes
fears
wishes
followed
by
the
same
disappointments
throbbing
in
the
human
heart
and
so
we
may
see
them
if
we
look
forward
rising
up
for
ever
and
disappearing
like
vapourish
bubbles
in
the
human
breast
after
being
tossed
about
from
congregation
to
congregation
in
the
heats
of
the
unitarian
controversy
and
squabbles
about
the
american
war
he
had
been
relegated
to
an
obscure
village
where
he
was
to
spend
the
last
thirty
years
of
his
life
far
from
the
only
converse
that
he
loved
the
talk
about
disputed
texts
of
scripture
and
the
cause
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
here
he
passed
his
days
repining
but
resigned
in
the
study
of
the
bible
and
the
perusal
of
the
commentators
huge
folios
not
easily
got
through
one
of
which
would
outlast
a
winter
why
did
he
pore
on
these
from
morn
to
night
with
the
exception
of
a
walk
in
the
fields
or
a
turn
in
the
garden
to
gather
or
kidney
beans
of
his
own
rearing
with
no
small
degree
of
pride
and
pleasure
here
were
figures
nor
no
fantasies
neither
poetry
nor
philosophy
nothing
to
dazzle
nothing
to
excite
modern
curiosity
but
to
his
eyes
there
appeared
within
the
pages
of
the
ponderous
unwieldy
neglected
tomes
the
sacred
name
of
jehovah
in
hebrew
capitals
pressed
down
by
the
weight
of
the
style
worn
to
the
last
fading
thinness
of
the
understanding
there
were
glimpses
glimmering
notions
of
the
patriarchal
wanderings
with
hovering
in
the
horizon
and
processions
of
camels
at
the
distance
of
three
thousand
years
there
was
moses
with
the
burning
bush
the
number
of
the
twelve
tribes
types
shadows
glosses
on
the
law
and
the
prophets
there
were
discussions
dull
enough
on
the
age
of
methuselah
a
mighty
speculation
there
were
outlines
rude
guesses
at
the
shape
of
noah
ark
and
of
the
riches
of
solomon
temple
questions
as
to
the
date
of
the
creation
predictions
of
the
end
of
all
things
the
great
lapses
of
time
the
strange
mutations
of
the
globe
were
unfolded
with
the
voluminous
leaf
as
it
turned
over
and
though
the
soul
might
slumber
with
an
hieroglyphic
veil
of
inscrutable
mysteries
drawn
over
it
yet
it
was
in
a
slumber
for
all
the
sharpened
realities
of
sense
wit
fancy
or
reason
my
life
was
comparatively
a
dream
but
it
was
a
dream
of
infinity
and
eternity
of
death
the
resurrection
and
a
judgment
to
come
no
two
individuals
were
ever
more
unlike
than
were
the
host
and
his
guest
a
poet
was
to
my
father
a
sort
of
nondescript
yet
whatever
added
grace
to
the
unitarian
cause
was
to
him
welcome
he
could
hardly
have
been
more
surprised
or
pleased
if
our
visitor
had
worn
wings
indeed
his
thoughts
had
wings
and
as
the
silken
sounds
rustled
round
our
little
wainscoted
parlour
my
father
threw
back
his
spectacles
over
his
forehead
his
white
hairs
mixing
with
its
sanguine
hue
and
a
smile
of
delight
beamed
across
his
rugged
cordial
face
to
think
that
truth
had
found
a
new
ally
in
fancy
besides
coleridge
seemed
to
take
considerable
notice
of
me
and
that
of
itself
was
enough
he
talked
very
familiarly
but
agreeably
and
glanced
over
a
variety
of
subjects
at
he
grew
more
animated
and
dilated
in
a
very
edifying
manner
on
mary
wolstonecraft
and
mackintosh
the
last
he
said
he
considered
on
my
father
speaking
of
his
as
a
capital
performance
as
a
clever
scholastic
man
a
master
of
the
topics
or
as
the
ready
warehouseman
of
letters
who
knew
exactly
where
to
lay
his
hand
on
what
he
wanted
though
the
goods
were
not
his
own
he
thought
him
no
match
for
burke
either
in
style
or
matter
burke
was
a
metaphysician
mackintosh
a
mere
logician
burke
was
an
orator
almost
a
poet
who
reasoned
in
figures
because
he
had
an
eye
for
nature
mackintosh
on
the
other
hand
was
a
rhetorician
who
had
only
an
eye
to
commonplaces
on
this
i
ventured
to
say
that
i
had
always
entertained
a
great
opinion
of
burke
and
that
as
far
as
i
could
find
the
speaking
of
him
with
contempt
might
be
made
the
test
of
a
vulgar
democratical
mind
this
was
the
first
observation
i
ever
made
to
coleridge
and
he
said
it
was
a
very
just
and
striking
one
i
remember
the
leg
of
welsh
mutton
and
the
turnips
on
the
table
that
day
had
the
finest
flavour
imaginable
coleridge
added
that
mackintosh
and
tom
wedgwood
of
whom
however
he
spoke
highly
had
expressed
a
very
indifferent
opinion
of
his
friend
wordsworth
on
which
he
remarked
to
them
strides
on
so
far
before
you
that
he
dwindles
in
the
distance
godwin
had
once
boasted
to
him
of
having
carried
on
an
argument
with
mackintosh
for
three
hours
with
dubious
success
coleridge
told
him
there
had
been
a
man
of
genius
in
the
room
he
would
have
settled
the
question
in
five
minutes
he
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
seen
mary
wolstonecraft
and
i
said
i
had
once
for
a
few
moments
and
that
she
seemed
to
me
to
turn
off
godwin
objections
to
something
she
advanced
with
quite
a
playful
easy
air
he
replied
that
was
only
one
instance
of
the
ascendency
which
people
of
imagination
exercised
over
those
of
mere
intellect
he
did
not
rate
godwin
very
high
this
was
caprice
or
prejudice
real
or
affected
but
he
had
a
great
idea
of
wolstonecraft
powers
of
conversation
none
at
all
of
her
talent
for
bookmaking
we
talked
a
little
about
holcroft
he
had
been
asked
if
he
was
not
much
struck
him
and
he
said
he
thought
himself
in
more
danger
of
being
struck
him
i
complained
that
he
would
not
let
me
get
on
at
all
for
he
required
a
definition
of
every
the
commonest
word
exclaiming
do
you
mean
by
a
sir
what
do
you
mean
by
an
this
coleridge
said
was
barricadoing
the
road
to
truth
it
was
setting
up
a
at
every
step
we
took
i
forget
a
great
number
of
things
many
more
than
i
remember
but
the
day
passed
off
pleasantly
and
the
next
morning
coleridge
was
to
return
to
shrewsbury
when
i
came
down
to
breakfast
i
found
that
he
had
just
received
a
letter
from
his
friend
wedgwood
making
him
an
offer
of
a
year
if
he
chose
to
waive
his
present
pursuit
and
devote
himself
entirely
to
the
study
of
poetry
and
philosophy
coleridge
seemed
to
make
up
his
mind
to
close
with
this
proposal
in
the
act
of
tying
on
one
of
his
shoes
it
threw
an
additional
damp
on
his
departure
it
took
the
wayward
enthusiast
quite
from
us
to
cast
him
into
deva
winding
vales
or
by
the
shores
of
old
romance
instead
of
living
at
ten
miles
distance
of
being
the
pastor
of
a
dissenting
congregation
at
shrewsbury
he
was
henceforth
to
inhabit
the
hill
of
parnassus
to
be
a
shepherd
on
the
delectable
mountains
alas
i
knew
not
the
way
thither
and
felt
very
little
gratitude
for
bounty
i
was
presently
relieved
from
this
dilemma
for
coleridge
asking
for
a
pen
and
ink
and
going
to
a
table
to
write
something
on
a
bit
of
card
advanced
towards
me
with
undulating
step
and
giving
me
the
precious
document
said
that
that
was
his
address
coleridge
and
that
he
should
be
glad
to
see
me
there
in
a
few
weeks
time
and
if
i
chose
would
come
to
meet
me
i
was
not
less
surprised
than
the
this
simile
is
to
be
found
in
when
he
sees
a
thunderbolt
fall
close
at
his
feet
i
stammered
out
my
acknowledgments
and
acceptance
of
this
offer
i
thought
wedgwood
annuity
a
trifle
to
it
as
well
as
i
could
and
this
mighty
business
being
settled
the
poet
preacher
took
leave
and
i
accompanied
him
six
miles
on
the
road
it
was
a
fine
morning
in
the
middle
of
winter
and
he
talked
the
whole
way
the
scholar
in
chaucer
is
described
as
going
on
his
way
so
coleridge
went
on
his
in
digressing
in
dilating
in
passing
from
subject
to
subject
he
appeared
to
me
to
float
in
air
to
slide
on
ice
he
told
me
in
confidence
going
along
that
he
should
have
preached
two
sermons
before
he
accepted
the
situation
at
shrewsbury
one
on
infant
baptism
the
other
on
the
lord
supper
showing
that
he
could
not
administer
either
which
would
have
effectually
disqualified
him
for
the
object
in
view
i
observed
that
he
continually
crossed
me
on
the
way
by
shifting
from
one
side
of
the
footpath
to
the
other
this
struck
me
as
an
odd
movement
but
i
did
not
at
that
time
connect
it
with
any
instability
of
purpose
or
involuntary
change
of
principle
as
i
have
done
since
he
seemed
unable
to
keep
on
in
a
straight
line
he
spoke
slightingly
of
hume
whose
on
he
said
was
stolen
from
an
objection
started
in
one
of
south
sermons
judæus
appella
i
was
not
very
much
pleased
at
this
account
of
hume
for
i
had
just
been
reading
with
infinite
relish
that
completest
of
all
metaphysical
his
on
human
to
which
the
in
point
of
scholastic
subtility
and
close
reasoning
are
mere
elegant
trifling
light
summer
reading
coleridge
even
denied
the
excellence
of
hume
general
style
which
i
think
betrayed
a
want
of
taste
or
candour
he
however
made
me
amends
by
the
manner
in
which
he
spoke
of
berkeley
he
dwelt
particularly
on
his
on
as
a
masterpiece
of
analytical
reasoning
so
it
undoubtedly
is
he
was
exceedingly
angry
with
johnson
for
striking
the
stone
with
his
foot
in
allusion
to
this
author
of
matter
and
and
saying
i
confute
him
sir
coleridge
drew
a
parallel
i
do
know
how
he
brought
about
the
connection
between
bishop
berkeley
and
tom
paine
he
said
the
one
was
an
instance
of
a
subtle
the
other
of
an
acute
mind
than
which
no
two
things
could
be
more
distinct
the
one
was
a
quality
the
other
the
characteristic
of
a
philosopher
he
considered
bishop
butler
as
a
true
philosopher
a
profound
and
conscientious
thinker
a
genuine
reader
of
nature
and
his
own
mind
he
did
not
speak
of
his
but
of
his
at
the
rolls
of
which
i
had
never
heard
coleridge
somehow
always
contrived
to
prefer
the
to
the
in
this
instance
he
was
right
the
is
a
tissue
of
sophistry
of
theological
the
with
the
preface
to
them
are
in
a
fine
vein
of
deep
matured
reflection
a
candid
appeal
to
our
observation
of
human
nature
without
pedantry
and
without
bias
i
told
coleridge
i
had
written
a
few
remarks
and
was
sometimes
foolish
enough
to
believe
that
i
had
made
a
discovery
on
the
same
subject
the
disinterestedness
of
the
human
and
i
tried
to
explain
my
view
of
it
to
coleridge
who
listened
with
great
willingness
but
i
did
not
succeed
in
making
myself
understood
i
sat
down
to
the
task
shortly
afterwards
for
the
twentieth
time
got
new
pens
and
paper
determined
to
make
clear
work
of
it
wrote
a
few
meagre
sentences
in
the
skeleton
style
of
a
mathematical
demonstration
stopped
down
the
second
page
and
after
trying
in
vain
to
pump
up
any
words
images
notions
apprehensions
facts
or
observations
from
that
gulf
of
abstraction
in
which
i
had
plunged
myself
for
four
or
five
years
preceding
gave
up
the
attempt
as
labour
in
vain
and
shed
tears
of
helpless
despondency
on
the
blank
unfinished
paper
i
can
write
fast
enough
now
am
i
better
than
i
was
then
oh
no
one
truth
discovered
one
pang
of
regret
at
not
being
able
to
express
it
is
better
than
all
the
fluency
and
flippancy
in
the
world
would
that
i
could
go
back
to
what
i
then
was
why
can
we
not
revive
past
times
as
we
can
revisit
old
places
if
i
had
the
quaint
muse
of
sir
philip
sidney
to
assist
me
i
would
write
a
to
the
road
between
wem
and
and
immortalise
every
step
of
it
by
some
fond
enigmatical
conceit
i
would
swear
that
the
very
milestones
had
ears
and
that
harmer
hill
stooped
with
all
its
pines
to
listen
to
a
poet
as
he
passed
i
remember
but
one
other
topic
of
discourse
in
this
walk
he
mentioned
paley
praised
the
naturalness
and
clearness
of
his
style
but
condemned
his
sentiments
thought
him
a
mere
casuist
and
said
that
fact
of
his
work
on
moral
and
political
philosophy
being
made
a
in
our
universities
was
a
disgrace
to
the
national
character
we
parted
at
the
stone
and
i
returned
homeward
pensive
but
much
pleased
i
had
met
with
unexpected
notice
from
a
person
whom
i
believed
to
have
been
prejudiced
against
me
and
affable
to
me
had
been
his
condescension
and
should
be
honoured
ever
with
suitable
regard
he
was
the
first
poet
i
had
known
and
he
certainly
answered
to
that
inspired
name
i
had
heard
a
great
deal
of
his
powers
of
conversation
and
was
not
disappointed
in
fact
i
never
met
with
anything
at
all
like
them
either
before
or
since
i
could
easily
credit
the
accounts
which
were
circulated
of
his
holding
forth
to
a
large
party
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
an
evening
or
two
before
on
the
berkeleian
theory
when
he
made
the
whole
material
universe
look
like
a
transparency
of
fine
words
and
another
story
which
i
believe
he
has
somewhere
told
himself
of
his
being
asked
to
a
party
at
birmingham
of
his
smoking
tobacco
and
going
to
sleep
after
dinner
on
a
sofa
where
the
company
found
him
to
their
no
small
surprise
which
was
increased
to
wonder
when
he
started
up
of
a
sudden
and
rubbing
his
eyes
looked
about
him
and
launched
into
a
three
description
of
the
third
heaven
of
which
he
had
had
a
dream
very
different
from
southey
of
and
also
from
that
other
of
which
murray
the
secretary
of
the
junta
took
into
his
especial
keeping
on
my
way
back
i
had
a
sound
in
my
ears
it
was
the
voice
of
fancy
i
had
a
light
before
me
it
was
the
face
of
poetry
the
one
still
lingers
there
the
other
has
not
quitted
my
side
coleridge
in
truth
met
me
on
the
ground
of
philosophy
or
i
should
not
have
been
won
over
to
his
imaginative
creed
i
had
an
uneasy
pleasurable
sensation
all
the
time
till
i
was
to
visit
him
during
those
months
the
chill
breath
of
winter
gave
me
a
welcoming
the
vernal
air
was
balm
and
inspiration
to
me
the
golden
sunsets
the
silver
star
of
evening
lighted
me
on
my
way
to
new
hopes
and
prospects
was
to
visit
coleridge
in
the
this
circumstance
was
never
absent
from
my
thoughts
and
mingled
with
all
my
feelings
i
wrote
to
him
at
the
time
proposed
and
received
an
answer
postponing
my
intended
visit
for
a
week
or
two
but
very
cordially
urging
me
to
complete
my
promise
then
this
delay
did
not
damp
but
rather
increased
my
ardour
in
the
meantime
i
went
to
llangollen
vale
by
way
of
initiating
myself
in
the
mysteries
of
natural
scenery
and
i
must
say
i
was
enchanted
with
it
i
had
been
reading
coleridge
description
of
england
in
his
fine
on
the
departing
and
i
applied
it
to
the
objects
before
me
that
valley
was
to
me
in
a
manner
the
cradle
of
a
new
existence
in
the
river
that
winds
through
it
my
spirit
was
baptized
in
the
waters
of
helicon
i
returned
home
and
soon
after
set
out
on
my
journey
with
unworn
heart
and
untired
feet
my
way
lay
through
worcester
and
gloucester
and
by
upton
where
i
thought
of
tom
jones
and
the
adventure
of
the
muff
i
remember
getting
completely
wet
through
one
day
and
stopping
at
an
inn
i
think
it
was
at
tewkesbury
where
i
sat
up
all
night
to
read
and
sweet
were
the
showers
in
early
youth
that
drenched
my
body
and
sweet
the
drops
of
pity
that
fell
upon
the
books
i
read
i
recollect
a
remark
of
coleridge
upon
this
very
book
that
nothing
could
show
the
gross
indelicacy
of
french
manners
and
the
entire
corruption
of
their
imagination
more
strongly
than
the
behaviour
of
the
heroine
in
the
last
fatal
scene
who
turns
away
from
a
person
on
board
the
sinking
vessel
that
offers
to
save
her
life
because
he
has
thrown
off
his
clothes
to
assist
him
in
swimming
was
this
a
time
to
think
of
such
a
circumstance
i
once
hinted
to
wordsworth
as
we
were
sailing
in
his
boat
on
grasmere
lake
that
i
thought
he
had
borrowed
the
idea
of
his
on
the
naming
of
from
the
local
inscriptions
of
the
same
kind
in
and
he
did
not
own
the
obligation
and
stated
some
distinction
without
a
difference
in
defence
of
his
claim
to
originality
any
the
slightest
variation
would
be
sufficient
for
this
purpose
in
his
mind
for
whatever
added
or
altered
would
inevitably
be
worth
all
that
any
one
else
had
done
and
contain
the
marrow
of
the
sentiment
i
was
still
two
days
before
the
time
fixed
for
my
arrival
for
i
had
taken
care
to
set
out
early
enough
i
stopped
these
two
days
at
bridgewater
and
when
i
was
tired
of
sauntering
on
the
banks
of
its
muddy
river
returned
to
the
inn
and
read
so
have
i
loitered
my
life
away
reading
books
looking
at
pictures
going
to
plays
hearing
thinking
writing
on
what
pleased
me
best
i
have
wanted
only
one
thing
to
make
me
happy
but
wanting
that
have
wanted
everything
i
arrived
and
was
well
received
the
country
about
nether
stowey
is
beautiful
green
and
hilly
and
near
the
i
saw
it
but
the
other
day
after
an
interval
of
twenty
years
from
a
hill
near
taunton
how
was
the
map
of
my
life
spread
out
before
me
as
the
map
of
the
country
lay
at
my
feet
in
the
afternoon
coleridge
took
me
over
to
a
romantic
old
family
mansion
of
the
aubins
where
wordsworth
lived
it
was
then
in
the
possession
of
a
friend
of
the
poet
who
gave
him
the
free
use
of
it
somehow
that
period
the
time
just
after
the
french
revolution
was
not
a
time
when
was
given
for
the
mind
opened
and
a
softness
might
be
perceived
coming
over
the
heart
of
individuals
beneath
scales
that
fence
our
wordsworth
himself
was
from
home
but
his
sister
kept
house
and
set
before
us
a
frugal
repast
and
we
had
free
access
to
her
brother
poems
the
which
were
still
in
manuscript
or
in
the
form
of
i
dipped
into
a
few
of
these
with
great
satisfaction
and
with
the
faith
of
a
novice
i
slept
that
night
in
an
old
room
with
blue
hangings
and
covered
with
the
family
portraits
of
the
age
of
george
and
and
from
the
wooded
declivity
of
the
adjoining
park
that
overlooked
my
window
at
the
dawn
of
day
could
the
loud
stag
speak
in
the
outset
of
life
and
particularly
at
this
time
i
felt
it
so
our
imagination
has
a
body
to
it
we
are
in
a
state
between
sleeping
and
waking
and
have
indistinct
but
glorious
glimpses
of
strange
shapes
and
there
is
always
something
to
come
better
than
what
we
see
as
in
our
dreams
the
fulness
of
the
blood
gives
warmth
and
reality
to
the
coinage
of
the
brain
so
in
youth
our
ideas
are
clothed
and
fed
and
pampered
with
our
good
spirits
we
breathe
thick
with
thoughtless
happiness
the
weight
of
future
years
presses
on
the
strong
pulses
of
the
heart
and
we
repose
with
undisturbed
faith
in
truth
and
good
as
we
advance
we
exhaust
our
fund
of
enjoyment
and
of
hope
we
are
no
longer
wrapped
in
lulled
in
elysium
as
we
taste
the
pleasures
of
life
their
spirit
evaporates
the
sense
palls
and
nothing
is
left
but
the
phantoms
the
lifeless
shadows
of
what
that
morning
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
we
strolled
out
into
the
park
and
seating
ourselves
on
the
trunk
of
an
old
that
stretched
along
the
ground
coleridge
read
aloud
with
a
sonorous
and
musical
voice
the
ballad
of
i
was
not
critically
or
sceptically
inclined
i
saw
touches
of
truth
and
nature
and
took
the
rest
for
granted
but
in
the
the
and
the
of
a
poor
indian
i
felt
that
deeper
power
and
pathos
which
have
been
since
acknowledged
spite
of
pride
in
erring
reason
spite
as
the
characteristics
of
this
author
and
the
sense
of
a
new
style
and
a
new
spirit
in
poetry
came
over
me
it
had
to
me
something
of
the
effect
that
arises
from
the
turning
up
of
the
fresh
soil
or
of
the
first
welcome
breath
of
spring
yet
the
trembling
year
is
unconfirmed
coleridge
and
myself
walked
back
to
stowey
that
evening
and
his
voice
sounded
high
providence
foreknowledge
will
and
fate
fix
fate
foreknowledge
absolute
as
we
passed
through
echoing
grove
by
fairy
stream
or
waterfall
gleaming
in
the
summer
moonlight
he
lamented
that
wordsworth
was
not
prone
enough
to
believe
in
the
traditional
superstitions
of
the
place
and
that
there
was
a
something
corporeal
a
a
clinging
to
the
palpable
or
often
to
the
petty
in
his
poetry
in
consequence
his
genius
was
not
a
spirit
that
descended
to
him
through
the
air
it
sprung
out
of
the
ground
like
a
flower
or
unfolded
itself
from
a
green
spray
on
which
the
goldfinch
sang
he
said
however
if
i
remember
right
that
this
objection
must
be
confined
to
his
descriptive
pieces
that
his
philosophic
poetry
had
a
grand
and
comprehensive
spirit
in
it
so
that
his
soul
seemed
to
inhabit
the
universe
like
a
palace
and
to
discover
truth
by
intuition
rather
than
by
deduction
the
next
day
wordsworth
arrived
from
bristol
at
coleridge
cottage
i
think
i
see
him
now
he
answered
in
some
degree
to
his
friend
description
of
him
but
was
more
gaunt
and
don
he
was
quaintly
dressed
according
to
the
of
that
unconstrained
period
in
a
brown
fustian
jacket
and
striped
pantaloons
there
was
something
of
a
roll
a
lounge
in
his
gait
not
unlike
his
own
there
was
a
severe
worn
pressure
of
thought
about
his
temples
a
fire
in
his
eye
as
if
he
saw
something
in
objects
more
than
the
outward
appearance
an
intense
high
narrow
forehead
a
roman
nose
cheeks
furrowed
by
strong
purpose
and
feeling
and
a
convulsive
inclination
to
laughter
about
the
mouth
a
good
deal
at
variance
with
the
solemn
stately
expression
of
the
rest
of
his
face
chantrey
bust
wants
the
marking
traits
but
he
was
teased
into
making
it
regular
and
heavy
haydon
head
of
him
introduced
into
the
of
christ
into
is
the
most
like
his
drooping
weight
of
thought
and
expression
he
sat
down
and
talked
very
naturally
and
freely
with
a
mixture
of
clear
gushing
accents
in
his
voice
a
deep
guttural
intonation
and
a
strong
tincture
of
the
northern
like
the
crust
on
wine
he
instantly
began
to
make
havoc
of
the
half
of
a
cheshire
cheese
on
the
table
and
said
triumphantly
that
marriage
with
experience
had
not
been
so
productive
as
southey
in
teaching
him
a
knowledge
of
the
good
things
of
this
life
he
had
been
to
see
the
by
monk
lewis
while
at
bristol
and
described
it
very
well
he
said
fitted
the
taste
of
the
audience
like
a
glove
this
merit
was
however
by
no
means
a
recommendation
of
it
according
to
the
severe
principles
of
the
new
school
which
reject
rather
than
court
popular
effect
wordsworth
looking
out
of
the
low
latticed
window
said
beautifully
the
sun
sets
on
that
yellow
bank
i
thought
within
myself
what
eyes
these
poets
see
nature
and
ever
after
when
i
saw
the
stream
upon
the
objects
facing
it
conceived
i
had
made
a
discovery
or
thanked
wordsworth
for
having
made
one
for
me
we
went
over
to
again
the
day
following
and
wordsworth
read
us
the
story
of
in
the
open
air
and
the
comment
upon
it
by
his
face
and
voice
was
very
different
from
that
of
some
later
critics
whatever
might
be
thought
of
the
poem
face
was
as
a
book
where
men
might
read
strange
matters
and
he
announced
the
fate
of
his
hero
in
prophetic
tones
there
is
a
in
the
recitation
both
of
coleridge
and
wordsworth
which
acts
as
a
spell
upon
the
hearer
and
disarms
the
judgment
perhaps
they
have
deceived
themselves
by
making
habitual
use
of
this
ambiguous
accompaniment
coleridge
manner
is
more
full
animated
and
varied
wordsworth
more
equable
sustained
and
internal
the
one
might
be
termed
more
the
other
more
coleridge
has
told
me
that
he
himself
liked
to
compose
in
walking
over
uneven
ground
or
breaking
through
the
straggling
branches
of
a
whereas
wordsworth
always
wrote
if
he
could
walking
up
and
down
a
straight
gravel
walk
or
in
some
spot
where
the
continuity
of
his
verse
met
with
no
collateral
interruption
returning
that
same
evening
i
got
into
a
metaphysical
argument
with
wordsworth
while
coleridge
was
explaining
the
different
notes
of
the
nightingale
to
his
sister
in
which
we
neither
of
us
succeeded
in
making
ourselves
perfectly
clear
and
intelligible
thus
i
passed
three
weeks
at
nether
stowey
and
in
the
neighbourhood
generally
devoting
the
afternoons
to
a
delightful
chat
in
an
arbour
made
of
bark
by
the
poet
friend
tom
poole
sitting
under
two
fine
and
listening
to
the
bees
humming
round
us
while
we
quaffed
our
it
was
agreed
among
other
things
that
we
should
make
a
jaunt
down
the
bristol
channel
as
far
as
linton
we
set
off
together
on
foot
coleridge
john
chester
and
i
this
chester
was
a
native
of
nether
stowey
one
of
those
who
were
attracted
to
coleridge
discourse
as
flies
are
to
honey
or
bees
in
to
the
sound
of
a
brass
pan
he
in
the
chase
like
a
dog
who
hunts
not
like
one
that
made
up
the
cry
he
had
on
a
brown
cloth
coat
boots
and
corduroy
breeches
was
low
in
stature
had
a
drag
in
his
walk
like
a
drover
which
he
assisted
by
a
hazel
switch
and
kept
on
a
sort
of
trot
by
the
side
of
coleridge
like
a
running
footman
by
a
state
coach
that
he
might
not
lose
a
syllable
or
sound
that
fell
from
coleridge
lips
he
told
me
his
private
opinion
that
coleridge
was
a
wonderful
man
he
scarcely
opened
his
lips
much
less
offered
an
opinion
the
whole
way
yet
of
the
three
had
i
to
choose
during
that
journey
i
would
be
john
chester
he
afterwards
followed
coleridge
into
germany
where
the
kantean
philosophers
were
puzzled
how
to
bring
him
under
any
of
their
categories
when
he
sat
down
at
table
with
his
idol
john
felicity
was
complete
sir
walter
scott
or
blackwood
when
they
sat
down
at
the
same
table
with
the
king
was
not
more
so
we
passed
dunster
on
our
right
a
small
town
between
the
brow
of
a
hill
and
the
sea
i
remember
eyeing
it
wistfully
as
it
lay
below
us
contrasted
with
the
woody
scene
around
it
looked
as
clear
as
pure
as
and
ideal
as
any
landscape
i
have
seen
since
of
gaspar
poussin
or
domenichino
we
had
a
long
day
march
our
feet
kept
time
to
the
echoes
of
coleridge
tongue
through
minehead
and
by
the
blue
anchor
and
on
to
linton
which
we
did
not
reach
till
near
midnight
and
where
we
had
some
difficulty
in
making
a
lodgment
we
however
knocked
the
people
of
the
house
up
at
last
and
we
were
repaid
for
our
apprehensions
and
fatigue
by
some
excellent
rashers
of
fried
bacon
and
eggs
the
view
in
coming
along
had
been
splendid
we
walked
for
miles
and
miles
on
dark
brown
heaths
overlooking
the
channel
with
the
welsh
hills
beyond
and
at
times
descended
into
little
sheltered
valleys
close
by
the
with
a
smuggler
face
scowling
by
us
and
then
had
to
ascend
conical
hills
with
a
path
winding
up
through
a
coppice
to
a
barren
top
like
a
monk
shaven
crown
from
one
of
which
i
pointed
out
to
coleridge
notice
the
bare
masts
of
a
vessel
on
the
very
edge
of
the
horizon
and
within
the
disk
of
the
setting
sun
like
his
own
in
the
at
linton
the
character
of
the
becomes
more
marked
and
rugged
there
is
a
place
called
the
of
i
suspect
this
was
only
the
poetical
name
for
it
bedded
among
precipices
overhanging
the
sea
with
rocky
caverns
beneath
into
which
the
waves
dash
and
where
the
for
ever
wheels
its
screaming
flight
on
the
tops
of
these
are
huge
stones
thrown
transverse
as
if
an
earthquake
had
tossed
them
there
and
behind
these
is
a
fretwork
of
perpendicular
rocks
something
like
the
a
came
on
while
we
were
at
the
inn
and
coleridge
was
running
out
to
enjoy
the
commotion
of
the
elements
in
the
of
but
as
if
in
spite
the
clouds
only
muttered
a
few
angry
sounds
and
let
fall
a
few
refreshing
drops
coleridge
told
me
that
he
and
wordsworth
were
to
have
made
this
place
the
scene
of
a
which
was
to
have
been
in
the
manner
of
but
far
superior
to
the
of
but
they
had
relinquished
the
design
in
the
morning
of
the
second
day
we
breakfasted
luxuriously
in
an
parlour
on
tea
toast
eggs
and
honey
in
the
very
sight
of
the
from
which
it
had
been
taken
and
a
garden
full
of
thyme
and
wild
flowers
that
had
produced
it
on
this
occasion
coleridge
spoke
of
virgil
but
not
well
i
do
not
think
he
had
much
feeling
for
the
classical
or
elegant
it
was
in
this
room
that
we
found
a
little
copy
of
the
lying
in
a
on
which
coleridge
exclaimed
is
true
fame
he
said
thomson
was
a
great
poet
rather
than
a
good
one
his
style
was
as
meretricious
as
his
thoughts
were
natural
he
spoke
of
cowper
as
the
best
modern
poet
he
said
the
were
an
experiment
about
to
be
tried
by
him
and
wordsworth
to
see
how
far
the
public
taste
would
endure
poetry
written
in
a
more
natural
and
simple
style
than
had
hitherto
been
attempted
totally
discarding
the
artifices
of
poetical
diction
and
making
use
only
of
such
words
as
had
probably
been
common
in
the
most
ordinary
language
since
the
days
of
henry
ii
some
comparison
was
introduced
between
shakspeare
and
milton
he
said
hardly
knew
which
to
prefer
shakspeare
appeared
to
him
a
mere
stripling
in
the
art
he
was
as
tall
and
as
strong
with
infinitely
more
activity
than
milton
but
he
never
appeared
to
have
come
to
man
estate
or
if
he
had
he
would
not
have
been
a
man
but
a
monster
he
spoke
with
contempt
of
gray
and
with
intolerance
of
pope
he
did
not
like
the
versification
of
the
latter
he
observed
that
ears
of
these
might
be
charged
with
having
short
memories
that
could
not
retain
the
harmony
of
whole
passages
he
thought
little
of
junius
as
a
writer
he
had
a
dislike
of
johnson
and
a
much
higher
opinion
of
burke
as
an
orator
and
politician
than
of
fox
or
pitt
he
however
thought
him
very
inferior
in
richness
of
style
and
imagery
to
some
of
our
elder
particularly
jeremy
taylor
he
liked
richardson
but
not
fielding
nor
could
i
get
him
to
enter
into
the
merits
of
in
short
he
was
profound
and
discriminating
with
respect
to
those
authors
whom
he
liked
and
where
he
gave
his
judgment
fair
play
capricious
perverse
and
prejudiced
in
his
antipathies
and
distastes
we
loitered
on
the
in
such
talk
as
this
a
whole
morning
and
i
recollect
met
with
a
curious
seaweed
of
which
john
chester
told
us
the
country
name
a
fisherman
gave
coleridge
an
account
of
a
boy
that
had
been
drowned
the
day
before
and
that
they
had
tried
to
save
him
at
the
risk
of
their
own
lives
he
said
did
not
know
how
it
was
that
they
ventured
but
sir
we
have
a
towards
one
another
this
expression
coleridge
remarked
to
me
was
a
fine
illustration
of
that
theory
of
disinterestedness
which
i
in
common
with
butler
had
adopted
i
broached
to
him
an
argument
of
mine
to
prove
that
was
not
mere
association
of
ideas
i
said
that
the
mark
in
the
sand
put
one
in
mind
of
a
man
foot
not
because
it
was
part
of
a
former
impression
of
a
man
foot
for
it
was
quite
new
but
because
it
was
like
the
shape
of
a
man
foot
he
assented
to
the
justness
of
this
distinction
which
i
have
explained
at
length
elsewhere
for
the
benefit
of
the
curious
and
john
chester
listened
not
from
any
interest
in
the
subject
but
because
he
was
astonished
that
i
should
be
able
to
suggest
anything
to
coleridge
that
he
did
not
already
know
we
returned
on
the
third
morning
and
coleridge
remarked
the
silent
curling
up
the
valleys
where
a
few
evenings
before
we
had
seen
the
lights
gleaming
through
the
dark
in
a
day
or
two
after
we
arrived
at
stowey
we
set
out
i
on
my
return
home
and
he
for
germany
it
was
a
sunday
morning
and
he
was
to
preach
that
day
for
toulmin
of
taunton
i
asked
him
if
he
had
prepared
anything
for
the
occasion
he
said
he
had
not
even
thought
of
the
text
but
should
as
soon
as
we
parted
i
did
not
go
to
hear
him
this
was
a
fault
but
we
met
in
the
evening
at
bridgewater
the
next
day
we
had
a
long
day
walk
to
bristol
and
sat
down
i
recollect
by
a
on
the
road
to
cool
ourselves
and
satisfy
our
thirst
when
coleridge
repeated
to
me
some
descriptive
lines
of
his
tragedy
of
which
i
must
say
became
his
mouth
and
that
occasion
better
than
they
some
years
after
did
elliston
and
the
boards
memory
shield
me
from
the
world
poor
strife
and
give
those
scenes
thine
everlasting
life
i
saw
no
more
of
him
for
a
year
or
two
during
which
period
he
had
been
wandering
in
the
hartz
forest
in
germany
and
his
return
was
cometary
meteorous
unlike
his
setting
out
it
was
not
till
some
time
after
that
i
knew
his
friends
lamb
and
southey
the
last
always
appears
to
me
as
i
first
saw
him
with
a
commonplace
book
under
his
arm
and
the
first
with
a
in
his
mouth
it
was
at
that
i
met
him
with
holcroft
and
coleridge
where
they
were
disputing
fiercely
which
was
the
best
as
he
was
or
man
as
he
is
to
me
says
lamb
as
he
is
to
be
this
saying
was
the
beginning
of
a
friendship
between
us
which
i
believe
still
continues
enough
of
this
for
the
present
there
is
matter
for
another
rhyme
and
i
to
this
may
add
a
second
tale
footnotes
my
father
was
one
of
those
who
mistook
his
talent
after
all
he
used
to
be
very
much
dissatisfied
that
i
preferred
his
to
his
the
last
were
forced
and
dry
the
first
came
naturally
from
him
for
ease
on
words
and
a
supine
monkish
indolent
pleasantry
i
have
never
seen
them
equalled
he
complained
in
particular
of
the
presumption
of
his
attempting
to
establish
the
future
immortality
of
man
as
he
said
what
death
was
or
what
life
was
and
the
tone
in
which
he
pronounced
these
two
words
seemed
to
convey
a
complete
image
of
both
he
had
no
idea
of
pictures
of
claude
or
raphael
and
at
this
time
i
had
as
little
as
he
he
sometimes
gives
a
striking
account
at
present
of
the
cartoons
at
pisa
by
buffamalco
and
others
of
one
in
particular
where
death
is
seen
in
the
air
brandishing
his
scythe
and
the
great
and
mighty
of
the
earth
shudder
at
his
approach
while
the
beggars
and
the
wretched
kneel
to
him
as
their
deliverer
he
would
of
course
understand
so
broad
and
fine
a
moral
as
this
at
any
time
essay
ii
of
persons
one
would
wish
to
have
seen
like
shadows
so
depart
lamb
it
was
i
think
who
suggested
this
subject
as
well
as
the
defence
of
guy
faux
which
i
urged
him
to
execute
as
however
he
would
undertake
neither
i
suppose
i
must
do
both
a
task
for
which
he
would
have
been
much
fitter
no
less
from
the
temerity
than
the
felicity
of
his
pen
so
sure
our
rapture
to
create
as
when
it
touch
the
brink
of
all
we
hate
compared
with
him
i
shall
i
fear
make
but
a
commonplace
piece
of
business
of
it
but
i
should
be
loth
the
idea
was
entirely
lost
and
besides
i
may
avail
myself
of
some
hints
of
his
in
the
progress
of
it
i
am
sometimes
i
suspect
a
better
reporter
of
the
ideas
of
other
people
than
expounder
of
my
own
i
pursue
the
one
too
far
into
paradox
or
mysticism
the
others
i
am
not
bound
to
follow
farther
than
i
like
or
than
seems
fair
and
reasonable
on
the
question
being
started
ayrton
said
suppose
the
two
first
persons
you
would
choose
to
see
would
be
the
two
greatest
names
in
english
literature
sir
isaac
newton
and
mr
locke
in
this
ayrton
as
usual
reckoned
without
his
host
every
one
burst
out
a
laughing
at
the
expression
of
lamb
face
in
which
impatience
was
restrained
by
courtesy
the
greatest
names
he
stammered
out
hastily
they
were
not
persons
not
persons
persons
said
ayrton
looking
wise
and
foolish
at
the
same
time
afraid
his
triumph
might
be
premature
is
rejoined
lamb
characters
you
know
by
locke
and
sir
isaac
newton
you
mean
the
on
the
human
and
the
which
we
have
to
this
day
beyond
their
contents
there
is
nothing
personally
interesting
in
the
men
but
what
we
want
to
see
any
one
for
is
when
there
is
something
peculiar
striking
in
the
individuals
more
than
we
can
learn
from
their
writings
and
yet
are
curious
to
know
i
dare
say
locke
and
newton
were
very
like
kneller
portraits
of
them
but
who
could
paint
shakspeare
retorted
ayrton
it
is
then
i
suppose
you
would
prefer
seeing
him
and
milton
instead
said
lamb
i
have
seen
so
much
of
shakspeare
on
the
stage
and
on
bookstalls
in
frontispieces
and
on
that
i
am
quite
tired
of
the
everlasting
repetition
and
as
to
milton
face
the
impressions
that
have
come
down
to
us
of
it
i
do
not
like
it
is
too
starched
and
puritanical
and
i
should
be
afraid
of
losing
some
of
the
manna
of
his
poetry
in
the
leaven
of
his
countenance
and
the
precisian
band
and
gown
shall
guess
no
more
said
ayrton
is
it
then
you
would
like
to
see
in
his
habit
as
he
lived
if
you
had
your
choice
of
the
whole
range
of
english
literature
lamb
then
named
sir
thomas
browne
and
fulke
greville
the
friend
of
sir
philip
sidney
as
the
two
worthies
whom
he
should
feel
the
greatest
pleasure
to
encounter
on
the
floor
of
his
apartment
in
their
nightgown
and
slippers
and
to
exchange
friendly
greeting
with
them
at
this
ayrton
laughed
outright
and
conceived
lamb
was
jesting
with
him
but
as
no
one
followed
his
example
he
thought
there
might
be
something
in
it
and
waited
for
an
explanation
in
a
state
of
whimsical
suspense
lamb
then
as
well
as
i
can
remember
a
conversation
that
passed
twenty
years
ago
how
time
slips
went
on
as
follows
reason
why
i
pitch
upon
these
two
authors
is
that
their
writings
are
riddles
and
they
themselves
the
most
mysterious
of
personages
they
resemble
the
soothsayers
of
old
who
dealt
in
dark
hints
and
doubtful
oracles
and
i
should
like
to
ask
them
the
meaning
of
what
no
mortal
but
themselves
i
should
suppose
can
fathom
there
is
johnson
i
have
no
curiosity
no
strange
uncertainty
about
him
he
and
boswell
together
have
pretty
well
let
me
into
the
secret
of
what
passed
through
his
mind
he
and
other
writers
like
him
are
sufficiently
explicit
my
friends
whose
repose
i
should
be
tempted
to
disturb
were
it
in
my
power
are
implicit
inextricable
inscrutable
i
look
at
that
obscure
but
gorgeous
prose
composition
the
i
seem
to
myself
to
look
into
a
deep
abyss
at
the
bottom
of
which
are
hid
pearls
and
rich
treasure
or
it
is
like
a
stately
labyrinth
of
doubt
and
withering
speculation
and
i
would
invoke
the
spirit
of
the
author
to
lead
me
through
it
besides
who
would
not
be
curious
to
see
the
lineaments
of
a
man
who
having
himself
been
twice
married
wished
that
mankind
were
propagated
like
trees
as
to
fulke
greville
he
is
like
nothing
but
one
of
his
own
prologues
spoken
by
the
ghost
of
an
old
king
of
ormus
a
truly
formidable
and
inviting
personage
his
style
is
apocalyptical
cabalistical
a
knot
worthy
of
such
an
apparition
to
untie
and
for
the
unravelling
a
passage
or
two
i
would
stand
the
brunt
of
an
encounter
with
so
portentous
a
commentator
am
afraid
in
that
case
said
ayrton
if
the
mystery
were
once
cleared
up
the
merit
might
be
lost
and
turning
to
me
whispered
a
friendly
apprehension
that
while
lamb
continued
to
admire
these
old
crabbed
authors
he
would
never
become
a
popular
writer
donne
was
mentioned
as
a
writer
of
the
same
period
with
a
very
interesting
countenance
whose
history
was
singular
and
whose
meaning
was
often
quite
as
without
a
personal
citation
from
the
dead
as
that
of
any
of
his
contemporaries
the
volume
was
produced
and
while
some
one
was
expatiating
on
the
exquisite
simplicity
and
beauty
of
the
portrait
prefixed
to
the
old
edition
ayrton
got
hold
of
the
poetry
and
exclaiming
have
we
here
read
the
following
lies
a
and
a
there
she
gives
the
best
light
to
his
sphear
or
each
is
both
and
all
and
so
they
unto
one
another
nothing
owe
there
was
no
resisting
this
till
lamb
seizing
the
volume
turned
to
the
beautiful
to
his
dissuading
her
from
accompanying
him
abroad
and
read
them
with
suffused
features
and
a
faltering
tongue
our
first
strange
and
fatal
interview
by
all
desires
which
thereof
did
ensue
by
our
long
starving
hopes
by
that
remorse
which
my
words
masculine
perswasive
force
begot
in
thee
and
by
the
memory
of

some

then
inquired
of
lamb
if
we
could
not
see
from
the
window
the
temple
walk
in
which
chaucer
used
to
take
his
exercise
and
on
his
name
being
put
to
the
vote
i
was
pleased
to
find
that
there
was
a
general
sensation
in
his
favour
in
all
but
ayrton
who
said
something
about
the
ruggedness
of
the
metre
and
even
objected
to
the
quaintness
of
the
orthography
i
was
vexed
at
this
superficial
gloss
pertinaciously
reducing
everything
to
its
own
trite
level
and
asked
he
did
not
think
it
would
be
worth
while
to
scan
the
eye
that
had
first
greeted
the
muse
in
that
dim
twilight
and
early
dawn
of
english
literature
to
see
the
head
round
which
the
visions
of
fancy
must
have
played
like
gleams
of
inspiration
or
a
sudden
glory
to
watch
those
lips
that
lisped
in
numbers
for
the
numbers
came
as
by
a
miracle
or
as
if
the
dumb
should
speak
nor
was
it
alone
that
he
had
been
the
first
to
tune
his
native
tongue
however
imperfectly
to
modern
ears
but
he
was
himself
a
noble
manly
character
standing
before
his
age
and
striving
to
advance
it
a
pleasant
humourist
withal
who
has
not
only
handed
down
to
us
the
living
manners
of
his
time
but
had
no
doubt
store
of
curious
and
quaint
devices
and
would
make
as
hearty
a
companion
as
mine
host
of
the
tabard
his
interview
with
petrarch
is
fraught
with
interest
yet
i
would
rather
have
seen
chaucer
in
company
with
the
author
of
the
and
have
heard
them
exchange
their
best
stories
together
the
against
the
story
of
the
the
of
bath
against
the
of
friar
how
fine
to
see
the
high
mysterious
brow
which
learning
then
wore
relieved
by
the
gay
familiar
tone
of
men
of
the
world
and
by
the
courtesies
of
genius
surely
the
thoughts
and
feelings
which
passed
through
the
minds
of
these
great
revivers
of
learning
these
cadmuses
who
sowed
the
teeth
of
letters
must
have
stamped
an
expression
on
their
features
as
different
from
the
moderns
as
their
books
and
well
worth
the
perusal
dante
i
continued
as
interesting
a
person
as
his
own
ugolino
one
whose
lineaments
curiosity
would
as
eagerly
devour
in
order
to
penetrate
his
spirit
and
the
only
one
of
the
italian
poets
i
should
care
much
to
see
there
is
a
fine
portrait
of
ariosto
by
no
less
a
hand
than
titian
light
moorish
spirited
but
not
answering
our
idea
the
same
artist
large
colossal
profile
of
peter
aretine
is
the
only
likeness
of
the
kind
that
has
the
effect
of
conversing
with
the
mighty
dead
and
this
is
truly
spectral
ghastly
necromantic
lamb
put
it
to
me
if
i
should
like
to
see
spenser
as
well
as
chaucer
and
i
answered
without
hesitation
for
that
his
beauties
were
ideal
visionary
not
palpable
or
personal
and
therefore
connected
with
less
curiosity
about
the
man
his
poetry
was
the
essence
of
romance
a
very
halo
round
the
bright
orb
of
fancy
and
the
bringing
in
the
individual
might
dissolve
the
charm
no
tones
of
voice
could
come
up
to
the
mellifluous
cadence
of
his
verse
no
form
but
of
a
winged
angel
could
vie
with
the
airy
shapes
he
has
described
he
was
to
my
apprehension
rather
a
creature
of
the
element
that
lived
in
the
rainbow
and
played
in
the
plighted
clouds
than
an
ordinary
mortal
or
if
he
did
appear
i
should
wish
it
to
be
as
a
mere
vision
like
one
of
his
own
pageants
and
that
he
should
pass
by
unquestioned
like
a
dream
or
sound
was
arion
crown
so
went
he
playing
on
the
plain
captain
burney
muttered
something
about
columbus
and
martin
burney
hinted
at
the
wandering
jew
but
the
last
was
set
aside
as
spurious
and
the
first
made
over
to
the
new
world
should
like
said
reynolds
have
seen
pope
talk
with
patty
blount
and
i
seen
goldsmith
every
one
turned
round
to
look
at
reynolds
as
if
by
so
doing
they
could
get
a
sight
at
goldsmith
asked
a
harsh
croaking
voice
johnson
in
the
years
he
did
not
write
anything
that
we
know
of
nor
is
there
any
account
of
him
in
boswell
during
those
two
years
was
he
in
scotland
with
the
pretender
he
seems
to
have
passed
through
the
scenes
in
the
highlands
in
company
with
boswell
many
years
after
with
eye
yet
as
if
they
were
familiar
to
him
or
associated
in
his
mind
with
interests
that
he
durst
not
explain
if
so
it
would
be
an
additional
reason
for
my
liking
him
and
i
would
give
something
to
have
seen
him
seated
in
the
tent
with
the
youthful
majesty
of
britain
and
penning
the
proclamation
to
all
true
subjects
and
adherents
of
the
legitimate
government
thought
said
ayrton
turning
short
round
upon
lamb
you
of
the
lake
school
did
not
like
pope
like
pope
my
dear
sir
you
must
be
under
a
mistake
i
can
read
him
over
and
over
for
ever
certainly

the
very
of
what

his

seemed
to
be
an
emanation
from
that
which
was
to
circle
his
name
after
death
he
was
so
far
enviable
and
one
would
feel
proud
to
have
witnessed
the
rare
spectacle
in
him
that
he
was
almost
the
only
poet
and
man
of
genius
who
met
with
his
reward
on
this
side
of
the
tomb
who
realised
in
friends
fortune
the
esteem
of
the
world
the
most
sanguine
hopes
of
a
youthful
ambition
and
who
found
that
sort
of
patronage
from
the
great
during
his
lifetime
which
they
would
be
thought
anxious
to
bestow
upon
him
after
his
death
read
gay
verses
to
him
on
his
supposed
return
from
greece
after
his
translation
of
homer
was
finished
and
say
if
you
would
not
gladly
join
the
bright
procession
that
welcomed
him
home
or
see
it
once
more
land
at
whitehall
stairs
said
reynolds
would
rather
have
seen
him
talking
with
patty
blount
or
riding
by
in

mary
wortley

erasmus
phillips
who
was
deep
in
a
game
of
piquet
at
the

to
martin
burney
to
ask
if
junius
would
not
be
a
fit
person
to
invoke
from
the
dead
said
lamb
he
would
agree
to
lay
aside
his
mask
we
were
now
at
a
stand
for
a
short
time
when
fielding
was
mentioned
as
a
candidate
only
one
however
seconded
the
proposition
all
means
but
only
to
look
at
him
through
the
glass
door
of
his
back
shop
hard
at
work
upon
one
of
his
novels
the
most
extraordinary
contrast
that
ever
was
presented
between
an
author
and
his
works
not
to
let
him
come
behind
his
counter
lest
he
should
want
you
to
turn
customer
or
to
go
upstairs
with
him
lest
he
should
offer
to
read
the
first
manuscript
of
sir
charles
grandison
which
was
originally
written
in
volumes
octavo
or
get
out
the
letters
of
his
female
correspondents
to
prove
that
joseph
andrews
was
low
there
was
but
one
statesman
in
the
whole
of
english
history
that
any
one
expressed
the
least
desire
to
see
oliver
cromwell
with
his
fine
frank
rough
pimply
face
and
wily
policy
and
one
enthusiast
john
bunyan
the
immortal
author
of
the
it
seemed
that
if
he
came
into
the
room
dreams
would
follow
him
and
that
each
person
would
nod
under
his
golden
cloud
in
heaven
a
canopy
as
strange
and
stately
as
any
in
homer
of
all
persons
near
our
own
time
garrick
name
was
received
with
the
greatest
enthusiasm
who
was
proposed
by
barron
field
he
presently
superseded
both
hogarth
and
handel
who
had
been
talked
of
but
then
it
was
on
condition
that
he
should
act
in
tragedy
and
comedy
in
the
play
and
the
farce
and
and
what
a
for
sore
that
would
be
who
would
not
part
with
a
income
at
least
almost
with
a
year
of
his
natural
life
to
be
present
at
it
besides
as
he
could
not
act
alone
and
recitations
are
unsatisfactory
things
what
a
troop
he
must
bring
with
him
the
barry
and
quin
and
shuter
and
weston
and
clive
and
pritchard
of
whom
i
have
heard
my
father
speak
as
so
great
a
favourite
when
he
was
young
this
would
indeed
be
a
revival
of
the
dead
the
restoring
of
art
and
so
much
the
more
desirable
as
such
is
the
lurking
scepticism
mingled
with
our
overstrained
admiration
of
past
excellence
that
though
we
have
the
speeches
of
burke
the
portraits
of
reynolds
the
writings
of
goldsmith
and
the
conversation
of
johnson
to
show
what
people
could
do
at
that
period
and
to
confirm
the
universal
testimony
to
the
merits
of
garrick
yet
as
it
was
before
our
time
we
have
our
misgivings
as
if
he
was
probably
after
all
little
better
than
a
actor
dressed
out
to
play
in
a
scarlet
coat
and
laced
for
one
i
should
like
to
have
seen
and
heard
with
my
own
eyes
and
ears
certainly
by
all
accounts
if
any
one
was
ever
moved
by
the
true
histrionic
it
was
garrick
when
he
followed
the
ghost
in
he
did
not
drop
the
sword
as
most
actors
do
behind
the
scenes
but
kept
the
point
raised
the
whole
way
round
so
fully
was
he
possessed
with
the
idea
or
so
anxious
not
to
lose
sight
of
his
part
for
a
moment
once
at
a
splendid
at
lord
they
suddenly
missed
garrick
and
could
not
imagine
what
was
become
of
him
till
they
were
drawn
to
the
window
by
the
convulsive
screams
and
peals
of
laughter
of
a
young
negro
boy
who
was
rolling
on
the
ground
in
an
ecstasy
of
delight
to
see
garrick
mimicking
a
in
the
with
his
stuck
out
behind
and
in
a
seeming
flutter
of
feathered
rage
and
pride
of
our
party
only
two
persons
present
had
seen
the
british
roscius
and
they
seemed
as
willing
as
the
rest
to
renew
their
acquaintance
with
their
old
favourite
we
were
interrupted
in
the
and
of
this
fanciful
speculation
by
a
grumbler
in
a
corner
who
declared
it
was
a
shame
to
make
all
this
rout
about
a
mere
player
and
to
the
neglect
and
exclusion
of
the
fine
old
dramatists
the
contemporaries
and
rivals
of
shakspeare
lamb
said
he
had
anticipated
this
objection
when
he
had
named
the
author
of
and
and
out
of
caprice
insisted
upon
keeping
him
to
represent
the
set
in
preference
to
the
wild
enthusiast
kit
marlowe
to
the
sexton
of
ann
webster
with
his
melancholy
and
to
decker
who
was
but
a
garrulous
proser
to
the
voluminous
heywood
and
even
to
beaumont
and
fletcher
whom
we
might
offend
by
complimenting
the
wrong
author
on
their
joint
productions
lord
brooke
on
the
contrary
stood
quite
by
himself
or
in
words
was
vast
species
alone
some
one
hinted
at
the
circumstance
of
his
being
a
lord
which
rather
startled
lamb
but
he
said
a
would
perhaps
dispense
with
strict
etiquette
on
being
regularly
addressed
by
his
title
ben
jonson
divided
our
suffrages
pretty
equally
some
were
afraid
he
would
begin
to
traduce
shakspeare
who
was
not
present
to
defend
himself
he
grows
disagreeable
it
was
whispered
aloud
is
godwin
can
match
him
at
length
his
romantic
visit
to
drummond
of
hawthornden
was
mentioned
and
turned
the
scale
in
his
favour
lamb
inquired
if
there
was
any
one
that
was
hanged
that
i
would
choose
to
mention
and
i
answered
eugene
aram
the
name
of
the
chrichton
was
suddenly
started
as
a
splendid
example
of
talents
so
different
from
the
generality
of
his
countrymen
this
choice
was
mightily
approved
by
a
present
who
declared
himself
descended
from
that
prodigy
of
learning
and
accomplishment
and
said
he
had
family
plate
in
his
possession
as
vouchers
for
the
fact
with
the
initials
chrichton
hunt
laughed
or
rather
roared
as
heartily
at
this
as
i
should
think
he
has
done
for
many
years
the
last
named
then
wished
to
know
whether
there
were
any
metaphysicians
to
whom
one
might
be
tempted
to
apply
the
wizard
spell
i
replied
there
were
only
six
in
modern
times
deserving
the
name
hobbes
berkeley
butler
hartley
hume
leibnitz
and
perhaps
jonathan
edwards
a
massachusetts
man
as
to
the
french
who
talked
fluently
of
having
this
science
there
was
not
a
tittle
in
any
of
their
writings
that
was
not
to
be
found
literally
in
the
authors
i
had
mentioned
horne
tooke
who
might
have
a
claim
to
come
in
under
the
head
of
grammar
was
still
living
none
of
these
names
seemed
to
excite
much
interest
and
i
did
not
plead
for
the
of
those
who
might
be
thought
best
fitted
by
the
abstracted
nature
of
their
studies
for
the
present
spiritual
and
disembodied
state
and
who
even
while
on
this
living
stage
were
nearly
divested
of
common
flesh
and
blood
as
ayrton
with
an
uneasy
fidgety
face
was
about
to
put
some
question
about
locke
and
dugald
stewart
he
was
prevented
by
martin
burney
who
observed
j
was
here
he
would
undoubtedly
be
for
having
up
those
profound
and
redoubted
socialists
thomas
aquinas
and
duns
scotus
i
said
this
might
be
fair
enough
in
him
who
had
read
or
fancied
he
had
read
the
original
works
but
i
did
not
see
how
we
could
have
any
right
to
call
up
these
authors
to
give
an
account
of
themselves
in
person
till
we
had
looked
into
their
writings
by
this
time
it
should
seem
that
some
rumour
of
our
whimsical
deliberation
had
got
wind
and
had
disturbed
the
in
their
shadowy
abodes
for
we
received
messages
from
several
candidates
that
we
had
just
been
thinking
of
gray
declined
our
invitation
though
he
had
not
yet
been
asked
gay
offered
to
come
and
bring
in
his
hand
the
duchess
of
bolton
the
original
polly
steele
and
addison
left
their
cards
as
captain
sentry
and
sir
roger
de
coverley
swift
came
in
and
sat
down
without
speaking
a
word
and
quitted
the
room
as
abruptly
otway
and
chatterton
were
seen
lingering
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
styx
but
could
not
muster
enough
between
them
to
pay
charon
his
fare
thomson
fell
asleep
in
the
boat
and
was
rowed
back
again
and
burns
sent
a
low
fellow
one
john
barleycorn
an
old
companion
of
his
who
had
conducted
him
to
the
other
world
to
say
that
he
had
during
his
lifetime
been
drawn
out
of
his
retirement
as
a
show
only
to
be
made
an
exciseman
of
and
that
he
would
rather
remain
where
he
was
he
desired
however
to
shake
hands
by
his
representative
the
hand
thus
held
out
was
in
a
burning
fever
and
shook
prodigiously
the
room
was
hung
round
with
several
portraits
of
eminent
painters
while
we
were
debating
whether
we
should
demand
speech
with
these
masters
of
mute
eloquence
whose
features
were
so
familiar
to
us
it
seemed
that
all
at
once
they
glided
from
their
frames
and
seated
themselves
at
some
little
distance
from
us
there
was
leonardo
with
his
majestic
beard
and
watchful
eye
having
a
bust
of
archimedes
before
him
next
him
was
raphael

turned
round
to
the
fornarina

on
his
other
side

placed
the
model
of
peter

the
table

his
side
titian

seated
with

a
beautiful

vandyke
appeared
as
his

rembrandt
was
hid
under
firs
gold
chains
and
jewels
which
sir
joshua
eyed
closely
holding
his
hand
so
as
to
shade
his
forehead
not
a
word
was
spoken
and
as
we
rose
to
do
them
homage
they
still
presented
the
same
surface
to
the
view
not
being
representations
of
living
people
we
got
rid
of
the
splendid
apparitions
by
signs
and
dumb
show
as
soon
as
they
had
melted
into
thin
air
there
was
a
loud
noise
at
the
outer
door
and
we
found
it
was
giotto
cimabue
and
ghirlandaio
who
had
been
raised
from
the
dead
by
their
earnest
desire
to
see
their
illustrious
successors
names
on
earth
in
fame
eternal
records
live
for
aye
finding
them
gone
they
had
no
ambition
to
be
seen
after
them
and
mournfully
withdrew

lamb
are
the
very
fellows
i
should
like
to
have
had
some
talk
with
to
know
how
they

all
was
dark
around

nothing
to

hunt
in
a
boisterous
tone
of
friendly
exultation
as
many
as
you
please
without
reserve
or
fear
of
molestation
j
was
perplexed
between
so
many
amiable
recollections
that
the
name
of
the
lady
of
his
choice
expired
in
a
pensive
whiff
of
his
pipe

declared
for

hutchinson
was
no
sooner
mentioned
than
she
carried
the
day
from
the
duchess
we
were
the
less
solicitous
on
this
subject
of
filling
up
the
posthumous
lists
of
good
women
as
there
was
already
one
in
the
room
as
good
as
sensible
and
in
all
respects
as
exemplary
as
the
best
of
them
could
be
for
their
lives
should
like
vastly
to
have
seen
ninon
de
said
that
incomparable
person
and
this
immediately
put
us
in
mind
that
we
had
neglected
to
pay
honour
due
to
our
friends
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
voltaire
the
patriarch
of
levity
and
rousseau

father
of

in
wisdom

in

illustrious
group
that
are

no

you
for

out
your
shadowy

crotchet

that
poor

an

i
would
give
something
to
see
him
sitting
pale

emaciated
surrounded
by
his
matches
and
his
barrels
of
gunpowder
and
expecting
the
moment
that
was
to
transport
him
to
paradise
for
his
heroic

if
i
say
any
more
there
is
that
fellow
godwin
will
make
something
of
it
and
as
to
judas

my
reason
is

i
would
fain
see
the
face
of
him
who
having
dipped
his

with

could
afterwards

no

one
of
the

in

language
one
of
the
dexterous
and
contrivances
of
our

prove
that
we
and
those
who
agree
with
us
combine
all
that
is
excellent

praiseworthy
in
our

as
in

that
all
the
vices
and
deformity
of
human
nature
take
refuge
with
those
who
differ

it
is
extending
and
fortifying
the
principle
of
the
by
calling
to
its
aid
the
de

screening
and
surrounding
our
favourite
propensities
and
obstinate
caprices
in
the
hollow
squares
or
dense
phalanxes
of
sects
and
parties
this
is
a
happy
mode
of
pampering
our
and
persuading
ourselves
that
we
and
those
that
side
with
us
are
salt
of
the
earth
of
giving
vent
to
the
morbid
humours
of
our
pride
envy
hatred
malice
and
all
uncharitableness
those
natural
secretions
of
the
human
heart
under
the
pretext
of
the
public
safety
or
a
voice
from
heaven
as
it
may
happen
and
of
heaping
every
excellence
into
one
scale
and
throwing
all
the
obloquy

in
virtue
of
a
nickname

watchword

a
badge
the
colour
of
a
ribbon
the
cut
of
a
dress
we
thus
desolate
the
globe
or
tear
a
country
in
pieces
to
show
that
we
are
the
only
people
fit
to
live
in
it
and
fancy
ourselves
angels
while
we
are
playing
the
devil
in
this
manner
the
huron
devours
the
iroquois
because
he
is
an
iroquois
and
the
iroquois
the
huron
for
a
similar
reason
neither
suspects
that
he
does
it
because
he
himself
is
a
savage
and
no
better
than
a
wild
beast
and
is
convinced
in
his
own
breast
that
the
difference
of
man
and
tribe
makes
a
total
difference
in
the
case
the
papist
persecutes
the
protestant
the
protestant
persecutes
the
papist
in
his
turn
and
each
fancies
that
he
has
a
plenary
right
to
do
so
while
he
keeps
in
view
only
the
offensive
epithet
which
the
common
link
of
brotherhood
between
them
the
church
of
england
the
dissenters
and
the
dissenters
when
they
had
the
opportunity
did
not
spare
the
church
of
england
the
whig
calls
the
tory
a
knave
the
tory
compliments
the
whig
with
the
same
title
and
each
thinks
the
abuse
sticks
to
the
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
himself
or
the
generic
name
of
on
the
contrary
it
cuts
both
ways
but
while
the
whigs
say
tory
is
a
knave
because
he
is
a
tory
this
is
as
much
as
to
say
can
not
be
a
knave
because
i
am
a
whig
and
by
exaggerating
the
profligacy
of
his
opponent
he
imagines
he
is
laying
the
sure
foundation
and
raising
the
lofty
superstructure
of
his
own
praises
but
if
he
says
which
is
the
truth
tory
is
not
a
rascal
because
he
is
a
tory
but
because
human
nature
in
power
and
with
the
temptation
is
a
rascal
then
this
would
imply
that
the
seeds
of
depravity
are
sown
in
his
own
bosom
and
might
shoot
out
into
full
growth
and
luxuriance
if
he
got
into
place
and
this
he
does
not
wish
to
develop
till
he
get
into
place
we
may
be
intolerant
even
in
advocating
the
cause
of
toleration
and
so
bent
on
making
proselytes
to
freethinking
as
to
allow
no
one
to
think
freely
but
ourselves
the
most
boundless
liberality
in
appearance
may
amount
in
reality
to
the
most
monstrous
ostracism
of
opinion
not
condemning
this
or
that
tenet
or
standing
up
for
this
or
that
sect
or
party
but
in
a
supercilious
superiority
to
all
sects
and
parties
alike
and
proscribing
in
one
sweeping
clause
all
arts
sciences
opinions
and
pursuits
but
our
own
till
the
time
of
locke
and
toland
a
general
toleration
was
never
dreamt
of
it
was
thought
right
on
all
hands
to
punish
and
discountenance
heretics
and
schismatics
but
each
party
alternately
claimed
to
be
true
christians
and
orthodox
believers
daniel
de
foe
who
spent
his
whole
life
and
wasted
his
strength
in
asserting
the
right
of
the
dissenters
to
a
toleration
and
got
nothing
for
his
pains
but
the
pillory
was
scandalised
at
the
proposal
of
the
general
principle
and
was
equally
strenuous
in
excluding
quakers
anabaptists
socinians
sceptics
and
all
who
did
not
agree
in
the
of
christianity
that
is
who
did
not
agree
with
him
from
the
benefit
of
such
an
indulgence
to
tender
consciences
we
wonder
at
the
cruelties
formerly
practised
upon
the
jews
is
there
anything
wonderful
in
it
they
were
at
that
time
the
only
people
to
make
a
butt
and
a
bugbear
of
to
set
up
as
a
mark
of
indignity
and
as
a
foil
to
our
for
the
principle
that
is
within
us
and
always
craving
its
prey
to
run
down
to
worry
and
make
sport
of
at
discretion
and
without
mercy
the
unvarying
uniformity
and
implicit
faith
of
the
catholic
church
had
imposed
silence
and
put
a
curb
on
our
jarring
dissensions
heartburnings
and
so
that
we
had
no
pretence
for
quarrelling
among
ourselves
for
the
glory
of
god
or
the
salvation
of
men
a
jordanus
bruno
an
atheist
or
sorcerer
once
in
a
way
would
hardly
suffice
to
stay
the
stomach
of
our
theological
rancour
we
therefore
fell
with
might
and
main
upon
the
jews
as
a
in
this
dearth
of
objects
of
spite
or
zeal
or
when
the
whole
of
europe
was
reconciled
to
the
bosom
of
holy
mother
church
went
to
the
holy
land
in
search
of
a
difference
of
opinion
and
a
ground
of
mortal
offence
but
no
sooner
was
there
a
division
of
the
christian
world
than
papist
fell
on
protestants
or
schismatics
and
schismatics
upon
one
another
with
the
same
loving
fury
as
they
had
before
fallen
upon
turks
and
jews
the
disposition
is
always
there
like
a
muzzled
mastiff
the
pretext
only
is
wanting
and
this
is
furnished
by
a
name
which
as
soon
as
it
is
affixed
to
different
sects
or
parties
gives
us
a
licence
we
think
to
let
loose
upon
them
all
our
malevolence
domineering
humour
love
of
power
and
wanton
mischief
as
if
they
were
of
different
species
the
sentiment
of
the
pious
english
bishop
was
good
who
on
seeing
a
criminal
led
to
execution
exclaimed
goes
my
wicked
self
if
we
look
at
common
patriotism
it
will
furnish
an
illustration
of
party
spirit
one
would
think
by
an
englishman
hatred
of
the
french
and
his
readiness
to
die
fighting
with
and
for
his
countrymen
that
all
the
nation
were
united
as
one
man
in
heart
and
hand
and
so
they
are
in
and
as
an
exercise
of
their
loyalty
and
courage
but
let
the
crisis
be
over
and
they
cool
wonderfully
begin
to
feel
the
distinctions
of
english
irish
and
scotch
fall
out
among
themselves
upon
some
minor
distinction
the
same
hand
that
was
eager
to
shed
the
blood
of
a
frenchman
will
not
give
a
crust
of
bread
or
a
cup
of
cold
water
to
a
fellow
countryman
in
distress
and
the
heroes
who
defended
the
walls
of
old
england
are
left
to
expose
their
wounds
and
crippled
limbs
to
gain
a
pittance
from
the
passengers
or
to
perish
of
hunger
cold
and
neglect
in
our
highways
such
is
the
effect
of
our
boasted
nationality
it
is
active
fierce
in
doing
mischief
dormantly
lukewarm
in
doing
good
we
may
also
see
why
the
greatest
stress
is
laid
on
trifles
in
religion
and
why
the
most
violent
animosities
arise
out
of
the
smallest
differences
either
in
this
or
in
politics
in
the
first
place
it
would
never
do
to
establish
our
superiority
over
others
by
the
acquisition
of
greater
virtues
or
by
discarding
our
vices
but
it
is
charming
to
do
this
by
merely
repeating
a
different
formula
of
prayer
turning
to
the
east
instead
of
the
west
he
should
fight
boldly
for
such
a
distinction
who
is
persuaded
it
will
furnish
him
a
passport
to
the
other
world
and
entitle
him
to
look
down
on
the
rest
of
his
fellows
as
over
to
secondly
we
often
hate
those
most
with
whom
we
have
only
a
slight
shade
of
difference
whether
in
politics
or
religion
because
as
the
whole
is
a
contest
for
precedence
and
infallibility
we
find
it
more
difficult
to
draw
the
line
of
distinction
where
so
many
points
are
conceded
and
are
staggered
in
our
conviction
by
the
arguments
of
those
whom
we
can
not
despise
as
totally
and
incorrigibly
in
the
wrong
the
high
church
party
in
queen
anne
time
were
disposed
to
sacrifice
the
low
church
and
dissenters
to
the
papists
because
they
were
more
galled
by
their
arguments
and
disconcerted
with
their
pretensions
in
private
life
the
reverse
of
the
foregoing
holds
good
that
is
trades
and
professions
present
a
direct
contrast
to
sects
and
parties
a
conformity
in
sentiment
strengthens
our
party
and
opinion
but
those
who
have
a
similarity
of
pursuit
are
rivals
in
interest
and
hence
the
old
maxim
that
of
a
trade
can
never
essay
iv
on
the
feeling
of
immortality
in
youth
no
young
man
believes
he
shall
ever
die
it
was
a
saying
of
my
brother
and
a
fine
one
there
is
a
feeling
of
eternity
in
youth
which
makes
us
amends
for
everything
to
be
young
is
to
be
as
one
of
the
immortals
one
half
of
time
indeed
is
spent
the
other
half
remains
in
store
for
us
with
all
its
countless
treasures
for
there
is
no
line
drawn
and
we
see
no
limit
to
our
hopes
and
wishes
we
make
the
coming
age
our
own
vast
the
unbounded
prospect
lies
before
us
death
old
age
are
words
without
a
meaning
a
dream
a
fiction
with
which
we
have
nothing
to
do
others
may
have
undergone
or
may
still
undergo
them
we
a
charmed
life
which
laughs
to
scorn
all
such
idle
fancies
as
in
setting
out
on
a
delightful
journey
we
strain
our
eager
sight
forward
the
lovely
scenes
at
distance
hail
and
see
no
end
to
prospect
after
prospect
new
objects
presenting
themselves
as
we
advance
so
in
the
outset
of
life
we
see
no
end
to
our
desires
nor
to
the
opportunities
of
gratifying
them
we
have
as
yet
found
no
obstacle
no
disposition
to
flag
and
it
seems
that
we
can
go
on
so
for
ever
we
look
round
in
a
new
world
full
of
life
and
motion
and
ceaseless
progress
and
feel
in
ourselves
all
the
vigour
and
spirit
to
keep
pace
with
it
and
do
not
foresee
from
any
present
signs
how
we
shall
be
left
behind
in
the
race
decline
into
old
age
and
drop
into
the
grave
it
is
the
simplicity
and
as
it
were
abstractedness
of
our
feelings
in
youth
that
so
to
speak
identifies
us
with
nature
and
our
experience
being
weak
and
our
passions
strong
makes
us
fancy
ourselves
immortal
like
it
our
connection
with
being
we
fondly
flatter
ourselves
is
an
indissoluble
and
lasting
union
as
infants
smile
and
sleep
we
are
rocked
in
the
cradle
of
our
desires
and
hushed
into
fancied
security
by
the
roar
of
the
universe
around
us
we
quaff
the
cup
of
life
with
eager
thirst
without
draining
it
and
joy
and
hope
seem
ever
mantling
to
the
brim
objects
press
around
us
filling
the
mind
with
their
magnitude
and
with
the
throng
of
desires
that
wait
upon
them
so
that
there
is
no
room
for
the
thoughts
of
death
we
are
too
much
dazzled
by
the
gorgeousness
and
novelty
of
the
bright
waking
dream
about
us
to
discern
the
dim
shadow
lingering
for
us
in
the
distance
nor
would
the
hold
that
life
has
taken
of
us
permit
us
to
detach
our
thoughts
that
way
even
if
we
could
we
are
too
much
absorbed
in
present
objects
and
pursuits
while
the
spirit
of
youth
remains
unimpaired
ere
wine
of
life
is
drunk
we
are
like
people
intoxicated
or
in
a
fever
who
are
hurried
away
by
the
violence
of
their
own
sensations
it
is
only
as
present
objects
begin
to
pall
upon
the
sense
as
we
have
been
disappointed
in
our
favourite
pursuits
cut
off
from
our
closest
ties
that
we
by
degrees
become
weaned
from
the
world
that
passion
loosens
its
hold
upon
futurity
and
that
we
begin
to
contemplate
as
in
a
glass
darkly
the
possibility
of
parting
with
it
for
good
till
then
the
example
of
others
has
no
effect
upon
us
casualties
we
avoid
the
slow
approaches
of
age
we
play
at
and
with
like
the
foolish
fat
scullion
in
sterne
who
hears
that
master
bobby
is
dead
our
only
reflection
is
am
not
i
the
idea
of
death
instead
of
staggering
our
confidence
only
seems
to
strengthen
and
enhance
our
sense
of
the
possession
and
enjoyment
of
life
others
may
fall
around
us
like
leaves
or
be
mowed
down
by
the
scythe
of
time
like
grass
these
are
but
metaphors
to
the
unreflecting
buoyant
ears
and
overweening
presumption
of
youth
it
is
not
till
we
see
the
flowers
of
love
hope
and
joy
withering
around
us
that
we
give
up
the
flattering
delusions
that
before
led
us
on
and
that
the
emptiness
and
dreariness
of
the
prospect
before
us
reconciles
us
hypothetically
to
the
silence
of
the
grave
life
is
indeed
a
strange
gift
and
its
privileges
are
most
mysterious
no
wonder
when
it
is
first
granted
to
us
that
our
gratitude
our
admiration
and
our
delight
should
prevent
us
from
reflecting
on
our
own
nothingness
or
from
thinking
it
will
ever
be
recalled
our
first
and
strongest
impressions
are
borrowed
from
the
mighty
scene
that
is
opened
to
us
and
we
unconsciously
transfer
its
durability
as
well
as
its
splendour
to
ourselves
so
newly
found
we
can
not
think
of
parting
with
it
yet
or
at
least
put
off
that
consideration
like
a
rustic
at
a
fair
we
are
full
of
amazement
and
rapture
and
have
no
thought
of
going
home
or
that
it
will
soon
be
night
we
know
our
existence
only
by
ourselves
and
confound
our
knowledge
with
the
objects
of
it
we
and
nature
are
therefore
one
otherwise
the
illusion
the
of
reason
and
the
flow
of
soul
to
which
we
are
invited
is
a
mockery
and
a
cruel
insult
we
do
not
go
from
a
play
till
the
last
act
is
ended
and
the
lights
are
about
to
be
extinguished
but
the
fairy
face
of
nature
still
shines
on
shall
we
be
called
away
before
the
curtain
falls
or
ere
we
have
scarce
had
a
glimpse
of
what
is
going
on
like
children
our
nature
holds
us
up
to
see
the
of
the
universe
and
then
as
if
we
were
a
burden
to
her
to
support
lets
us
fall
down
again
yet
what
brave
sublunary
things
does
not
this
pageant
present
like
a
ball
or
of
the
universe
to
see
the
golden
sun
the
azure
sky
the
outstretched
ocean
to
walk
upon
the
green
earth
and
be
lord
of
a
thousand
creatures
to
look
down
yawning
precipices
or
over
distant
sunny
vales
to
see
the
world
spread
out
under
one
feet
on
a
map
to
bring
the
stars
near
to
view
the
smallest
insects
through
a
microscope
to
read
history
and
consider
the
revolutions
of
empire
and
the
successions
of
generations
to
hear
of
the
glory
of
tyre
of
sidon
of
babylon
and
of
susa
and
to
say
all
these
were
before
me
and
are
now
nothing
to
say
i
exist
in
such
a
point
of
time
and
in
such
a
point
of
space
to
be
a
spectator
and
a
part
of
its
scene
to
witness
the
change
of
season
of
spring
and
autumn
of
winter
and
summer
to
feel
hot
and
cold
pleasure
and
pain
beauty
and
deformity
right
and
wrong
to
be
sensible
to
the
accidents
of
nature
to
consider
the
mighty
world
of
eye
and
ear
to
listen
to
the
notes
amid
the
forest
deep
to
journey
over
moor
and
mountain
to
hear
the
midnight
sainted
choir
to
visit
lighted
halls
or
the
cathedral
gloom
or
sit
in
crowded
theatres
and
see
life
itself
mocked
to
study
the
works
of
art
and
refine
the
sense
of
beauty
to
agony
to
worship
fame
and
to
dream
of
immortality
to
look
upon
the
vatican
and
to
read
shakspeare
to
gather
up
the
wisdom
of
the
ancients
and
to
pry
into
the
future
to
listen
to
the
trump
of
war
the
shout
of
victory
to
question
history
as
to
the
movements
of
the
human
heart
to
seek
for
truth
to
plead
the
cause
of
humanity
to
overlook
the
world
as
if
time
and
nature
poured
their
treasures
at
our
feet
to
be
and
to
do
all
this
and
then
in
a
moment
to
be
nothing
to
have
it
all
snatched
from
us
as
by
a
juggler
trick
or
a
phantasmagoria
there
is
something
in
this
transition
from
all
to
nothing
that
shocks
us
and
damps
the
enthusiasm
of
youth
new
flushed
with
hope
and
pleasure
and
we
cast
the
comfortless
thought
as
far
from
us
as
we
can
in
the
first
enjoyment
of
the
state
of
life
we
discard
the
fear
of
debts
and
duns
and
never
think
of
the
final
payment
of
our
great
debt
to
nature
art
we
know
is
long
life
we
flatter
ourselves
should
be
so
too
we
see
no
end
of
the
difficulties
and
delays
we
have
to
encounter
perfection
is
slow
of
attainment
and
we
must
have
time
to
accomplish
it
in
the
fame
of
the
great
names
we
look
up
to
is
immortal
and
shall
not
we
who
contemplate
it
imbibe
a
portion
of
ethereal
fire
the
particula
which
nothing
can
extinguish
a
wrinkle
in
rembrandt
or
in
nature
takes
whole
days
to
resolve
itself
into
its
component
parts
its
softenings
and
its
sharpnesses
we
refine
upon
our
perfections
and
unfold
the
intricacies
of
nature
what
a
prospect
for
the
future
what
a
task
have
we
not
begun
and
shall
we
be
arrested
in
the
middle
of
it
we
do
not
count
our
time
thus
employed
lost
or
our
pains
thrown
away
we
do
not
flag
or
grow
tired
but
gain
new
vigour
at
our
endless
task
shall
time
then
grudge
us
to
finish
what
we
have
begun
and
have
formed
a
compact
with
nature
to
do
why
not
fill
up
the
blank
that
is
left
us
in
this
manner
i
have
looked
for
hours
at
a
rembrandt
without
being
conscious
of
the
flight
of
time
but
with
ever
new
wonder
and
delight
have
thought
that
not
only
my
own
but
another
existence
i
could
pass
in
the
same
manner
this
rarefied
refined
existence
seemed
to
have
no
end
nor
stint
nor
principle
of
decay
in
it
the
print
would
remain
long
after
i
who
looked
on
it
had
become
the
prey
of
worms
the
thing
seems
in
itself
out
of
all
reason
health
strength
appetite
are
opposed
to
the
idea
of
death
and
we
are
not
ready
to
credit
it
till
we
have
found
our
illusions
vanished
and
our
hopes
grown
cold
objects
in
youth
from
novelty
are
stamped
upon
the
brain
with
such
force
and
integrity
that
one
thinks
nothing
can
remove
or
obliterate
them
they
are
riveted
there
and
appear
to
us
as
an
element
of
our
nature
it
must
be
a
mere
violence
that
destroys
them
not
a
natural
decay
in
the
very
strength
of
this
persuasion
we
seem
to
enjoy
an
age
by
anticipation
we
melt
down
years
into
a
single
moment
of
intense
sympathy
and
by
anticipating
the
fruits
defy
the
ravages
of
time
if
then
a
single
moment
of
our
lives
is
worth
years
shall
we
set
any
limits
to
its
total
value
and
extent
again
does
it
not
happen
that
so
secure
do
we
think
ourselves
of
an
indefinite
period
of
existence
that
at
times
when
left
to
ourselves
and
impatient
of
novelty
we
feel
annoyed
at
what
seems
to
us
the
slow
and
creeping
progress
of
time
and
argue
that
if
it
always
moves
at
this
tedious
snail
pace
it
will
never
come
to
an
end
how
ready
are
we
to
sacrifice
any
space
of
time
which
separates
us
from
a
favourite
object
little
thinking
that
before
long
we
shall
find
it
move
too
fast
for
my
part
i
started
in
life
with
the
french
revolution
and
i
have
lived
alas
to
see
the
end
of
it
but
i
did
not
foresee
this
result
my
sun
arose
with
the
first
dawn
of
liberty
and
i
did
not
think
how
soon
both
must
set
the
new
impulse
to
ardour
given
to
men
minds
imparted
a
congenial
warmth
and
glow
to
mine
we
were
strong
to
run
a
race
together
and
i
little
dreamed
that
long
before
mine
was
set
the
sun
of
liberty
would
turn
to
blood
or
set
once
more
in
the
night
of
despotism
since
then
i
confess
i
have
no
longer
felt
myself
young
for
with
that
my
hopes
fell
i
have
since
turned
my
thoughts
to
gathering
up
some
of
the
fragments
of
my
early
recollections
and
putting
them
into
a
form
to
which
i
might
occasionally
revert
the
future
was
barred
to
my
progress
and
i
turned
for
consolation
and
encouragement
to
the
past
it
is
thus
that
while
we
find
our
personal
and
substantial
identity
vanishing
from
us
we
strive
to
gain
a
reflected
and
vicarious
one
in
our
thoughts
we
do
not
like
to
perish
wholly
and
wish
to
bequeath
our
names
at
least
to
posterity
as
long
as
we
can
make
our
cherished
thoughts
and
nearest
interests
live
in
the
minds
of
others
we
do
not
appear
to
have
retired
altogether
from
the
stage
we
still
occupy
the
breasts
of
others
and
exert
an
influence
and
power
over
them
and
it
is
only
our
bodies
that
are
reduced
to
dust
and
powder
our
favourite
speculations
still
find
encouragement
and
we
make
as
great
a
figure
in
the
eye
of
the
world
or
perhaps
a
greater
than
in
our
lifetime
the
demands
of
our
are
thus
satisfied
and
these
are
the
most
imperious
and
unremitting
besides
if
by
our
intellectual
superiority
we
survive
ourselves
in
this
world
by
our
virtues
and
faith
we
may
attain
an
interest
in
another
and
a
higher
state
of
being
and
may
thus
be
recipients
at
the
same
time
of
men
and
of
angels
from
the
tomb
the
voice
of
nature
cries
in
our
ashes
live
their
wonted
fires
as
we
grow
old
our
sense
of
the
value
of
time
becomes
vivid
nothing
else
indeed
seems
of
any
consequence
we
can
never
cease
wondering
that
that
which
has
ever
been
should
cease
to
be
we
find
many
things
remain
the
same
why
then
should
there
be
change
in
us
this
adds
a
convulsive
grasp
of
whatever
is
a
sense
of
a
fallacious
hollowness
in
all
we
see
instead
of
the
full
pulpy
feeling
of
youth
tasting
existence
and
every
object
in
it
all
is
flat
and
vapid
a
whited
sepulchre
fair
without
but
full
of
ravening
and
all
uncleanness
within
the
world
is
a
witch
that
puts
us
off
with
false
shows
and
appearances
the
simplicity
of
youth
the
confiding
expectation
the
boundless
raptures
are
gone
we
only
think
of
getting
out
of
it
as
well
as
we
can
and
without
any
great
mischance
or
annoyance
the
flush
of
illusion
even
the
complacent
retrospect
of
past
joys
and
hopes
is
over
if
we
can
slip
out
of
life
without
indignity
can
escape
with
little
bodily
infirmity
and
frame
our
minds
to
the
calm
and
respectable
composure
of
before
we
return
to
physical
nothingness
it
is
as
much
as
we
can
expect
we
do
not
die
wholly
at
our
deaths
we
have
mouldered
away
gradually
long
before
faculty
after
faculty
interest
after
interest
attachment
after
attachment
disappear
we
are
torn
from
ourselves
while
living
year
after
year
sees
us
no
longer
the
same
and
death
only
consigns
the
last
fragment
of
what
we
were
to
the
grave
that
we
should
wear
out
by
slow
stages
and
dwindle
at
last
into
nothing
is
not
wonderful
when
even
in
our
prime
our
strongest
impressions
leave
little
trace
but
for
the
moment
and
we
are
the
creatures
of
petty
circumstance
how
little
effect
is
made
on
us
in
our
best
days
by
the
books
we
have
read
the
scenes
we
have
witnessed
the
sensations
we
have
gone
through
think
only
of
the
feelings
we
experience
in
reading
a
fine
romance
one
of
sir
walter
for
instance
what
beauty
what
sublimity
what
interest
what
emotions
you
would
suppose
the
feelings
you
then
experienced
would
last
for
ever
or
subdue
the
mind
to
their
own
harmony
and
tone
while
we
are
reading
it
seems
as
if
nothing
could
ever
put
us
out
of
our
way
or
trouble
us
the
first
splash
of
mud
that
we
get
on
entering
the
street
the
first
twopence
we
are
cheated
out
of
the
feeling
vanishes
clean
out
of
our
minds
and
we
become
the
prey
of
petty
and
annoying
circumstance
the
mind
soars
to
the
lofty
it
is
at
home
in
the
grovelling
the
disagreeable
and
the
little
and
yet
we
wonder
that
age
should
be
feeble
and
querulous
that
the
freshness
of
youth
should
fade
away
both
worlds
would
hardly
satisfy
the
extravagance
of
our
desires
and
of
our
presumption
essay
v
on
public
opinion
at
the
sound
itself
has
made
once
asking
a
friend
why
he
did
not
bring
forward
an
explanation
of
a
circumstance
in
which
his
conduct
had
been
called
in
question
he
said
friends
were
satisfied
on
the
subject
and
he
cared
very
little
about
the
opinion
of
the
world
i
made
answer
that
i
did
not
consider
this
a
good
ground
to
rest
his
defence
upon
for
that
a
friends
seldom
thought
better
of
him
than
the
world
did
i
see
no
reason
to
alter
this
opinion
our
friends
indeed
are
more
apt
than
a
mere
stranger
to
join
in
with
or
be
silent
under
any
imputation
thrown
out
against
us
because
they
are
apprehensive
they
may
be
indirectly
implicated
in
it
and
they
are
bound
to
betray
us
to
save
their
own
credit
to
judge
of
our
jealousy
our
sensibility
our
high
notions
of
responsibility
on
this
score
only
consider
if
a
single
individual
lets
fall
a
solitary
remark
implying
a
doubt
of
the
wit
the
sense
the
courage
of
a
friend
how
it
staggers
us
how
it
makes
us
shake
with
fear
how
it
makes
us
call
up
all
our
eloquence
and
airs
of
in
his
defence
lest
our
partiality
should
be
supposed
to
have
blinded
our
perceptions
and
we
should
be
regarded
as
the
dupes
of
a
mistaken
admiration
we
already
begin
to
meditate
an
escape
from
a
losing
cause
and
try
to
find
out
some
other
fault
in
the
character
under
discussion
to
show
that
we
are
not
if
the
truth
must
be
spoken
in
sagacity
and
a
sense
of
the
ridiculous
if
then
this
is
the
case
with
the
first
flaw
the
first
doubt
the
first
speck
that
dims
the
sun
of
friendship
so
that
we
are
ready
to
turn
our
backs
on
our
sworn
attachments
and
professions
the
instant
we
have
not
all
the
world
with
us
what
must
it
be
when
we
have
all
the
world
against
us
when
our
friend
instead
of
a
single
stain
is
covered
with
mud
from
head
to
foot
how
shall
we
expect
our
feeble
voices
not
to
be
drowned
in
the
general
clamour
how
shall
we
dare
to
oppose
our
partial
and
suffrages
to
the
just
indignation
of
the
public
or
if
it
should
not
amount
to
this
how
shall
we
answer
the
silence
and
contempt
with
which
his
name
is
received
how
shall
we
animate
the
great
mass
of
indifference
or
distrust
with
our
private
enthusiasm
how
defeat
the
involuntary
smile
or
the
suppressed
sneer
with
the
burst
of
generous
feeling
and
the
glow
of
honest
conviction
it
is
a
thing
not
to
be
thought
of
unless
we
would
enter
into
a
crusade
against
prejudice
and
malignity
devote
ourselves
as
martyrs
to
friendship
raise
a
controversy
in
every
company
we
go
into
quarrel
with
every
person
we
meet
and
after
making
ourselves
and
every
one
else
uncomfortable
leave
off
not
by
clearing
our
friend
reputation
but
by
involving
our
own
pretensions
to
decency
and
common
sense
people
will
not
fail
to
observe
that
a
man
may
have
his
reasons
for
his
faults
or
vices
but
that
for
another
to
volunteer
a
defence
of
them
is
without
excuse
it
is
in
fact
an
attempt
to
deprive
them
of
the
great
and
only
benefit
they
derive
from
the
supposed
errors
of
their
neighbours
and
contemporaries
the
pleasure
of
backbiting
and
railing
at
them
which
they
call
justice
it
is
not
a
single
breath
of
rumour
or
opinion
but
the
whole
atmosphere
is
infected
with
a
sort
of
aguish
taint
of
anger
and
suspicion
that
relaxes
the
nerves
of
fidelity
and
makes
our
most
sanguine
resolutions
sicken
and
turn
pale
and
he
who
is
proof
against
it
must
either
be
armed
with
a
love
of
truth
or
a
contempt
for
mankind
which
places
him
out
of
the
reach
of
ordinary
rules
and
calculations
for
myself
i
do
not
shrink
from
defending
a
cause
or
a
friend
a
though
in
neither
case
will
cheap
or
common
efforts
suffice
but
in
the
first
you
merely
stand
up
for
your
own
judgment
and
principles
against
fashion
and
prejudice
and
thus
assume
a
sort
of
manly
and
heroic
attitude
of
defiance
in
the
last
which
makes
it
a
matter
of
greater
nicety
and
nervous
sensibility
you
sneak
behind
another
to
throw
your
gauntlet
at
the
whole
world
and
it
requires
a
double
stock
of
stoical
firmness
not
to
be
laughed
out
of
your
boasted
zeal
and
independence
as
a
romantic
and
there
is
nothing
in
which
all
the
world
agree
but
in
running
down
some
obnoxious
individual
it
may
be
supposed
that
this
is
not
for
nothing
and
that
they
have
good
reasons
for
what
they
do
on
the
contrary
i
will
undertake
to
say
that
so
far
from
there
being
invariably
just
grounds
for
such
an
universal
outcry
the
universality
of
the
outcry
is
often
the
only
ground
of
the
opinion
and
that
it
is
purposely
raised
upon
this
principle
that
all
other
proof
or
evidence
against
the
person
meant
to
be
run
down
is
wanting
nay
further
it
may
happen
that
while
the
clamour
is
at
the
loudest
while
you
hear
it
from
all
quarters
while
it
blows
a
perfect
hurricane
while
world
rings
with
the
vain
stir
not
one
of
those
who
are
most
eager
in
hearing
and
echoing
knows
what
it
is
about
or
is
not
fully
persuaded
that
the
charge
is
equally
false
malicious
and
absurd
it
is
like
the
wind
that
man
knoweth
whence
it
cometh
or
whither
it
goeth
it
is
et
præterea
what
then
is
it
that
gives
it
its
confident
circulation
and
its
irresistible
force
it
is
the
loudness
of
the
organ
with
which
it
is
pronounced
the
stentorian
lungs
of
the
multitude
the
number
of
voices
that
take
it
up
and
repeat
it
because
others
have
done
so
the
rapid
flight
and
the
impalpable
nature
of
common
fame
that
makes
it
a
desperate
undertaking
for
any
individual
to
inquire
into
or
arrest
the
mischief
that
in
the
deafening
buzz
or
loosened
roar
of
laughter
or
indignation
renders
it
impossible
for
the
still
small
voice
of
reason
to
be
heard
and
leaves
no
other
course
to
honesty
or
prudence
than
to
fall
flat
on
the
face
before
it
as
before
the
pestilential
blast
of
the
desert
and
wait
till
it
has
passed
over
thus
every
one
joins
in
asserting
propagating
and
in
outwardly
approving
what
every
one
in
his
private
and
unbiassed
judgment
believes
and
knows
to
be
scandalous
and
untrue
for
every
one
in
such
circumstances
keeps
his
own
opinion
to
himself
and
only
attends
to
or
acts
upon
that
which
he
conceives
to
be
the
opinion
of
every
one
but
himself
so
that
public
opinion
is
not
seldom
a
farce
equal
to
any
acted
upon
the
stage
not
only
is
it
spurious
and
hollow
in
the
way
that
locke
points
out
by
one
man
taking
up
at
second
hand
the
opinion
of
another
but
worse
than
this
one
man
takes
up
what
he
believes
another
think
and
which
the
latter
professes
only
because
he
believes
it
held
by
the
first
all
therefore
that
is
necessary
to
control
public
opinion
is
to
gain
possession
of
some
organ
loud
and
lofty
enough
to
make
yourself
heard
that
has
power
and
interest
on
its
side
and
then
no
sooner
do
you
blow
a
blast
in
this
trump
of
like
the
horn
hung
up
on
an
old
than
you
are
answered
echoed
and
accredited
on
all
sides
the
gates
are
thrown
open
to
receive
you
and
you
are
admitted
into
the
very
heart
of
the
fortress
of
public
opinion
and
can
assail
from
the
ramparts
with
every
engine
of
abuse
and
with
privileged
impunity
all
those
who
may
come
forward
to
vindicate
the
truth
or
to
rescue
their
good
name
from
the
unprincipled
keeping
of
authority
servility
sophistry
and
venal
falsehood
the
only
thing
wanted
is
to
give
an
alarm
to
excite
a
panic
in
the
public
mind
of
being
left
the
and
the
rabble
whether
in
the
ranks
of
literature
or
war
will
throw
away
their
arms
and
surrender
at
discretion
to
any
bully
or
impostor
who
for
a
shall
choose
to
try
the
experiment
upon
them
what
i
have
here
described
is
the
effect
even
upon
the
candid
and
what
must
it
be
to
the
malicious
and
idle
who
are
eager
to
believe
all
the
ill
they
can
hear
of
every
one
or
to
the
prejudiced
and
interested
who
are
determined
to
credit
all
the
ill
they
hear
against
those
who
are
not
of
their
own
side
to
these
last
it
is
only
requisite
to
be
understood
that
the
butt
of
ridicule
or
slander
is
of
an
opposite
party
and
they
presently
give
you
to
say
what
you
please
of
him
do
they
know
that
it
is
true
no
but
they
believe
what
all
the
world
says
till
they
have
evidence
to
the
contrary
do
you
prove
that
it
is
false
they
dare
say
that
if
not
that
something
worse
remains
behind
and
they
retain
the
same
opinion
as
before
for
the
honour
of
their
party
they
hire
some
one
to
pelt
you
with
mud
and
then
affect
to
avoid
you
in
the
street
as
a
dirty
fellow
they
are
told
that
you
have
a
hump
on
your
back
and
then
wonder
at
your
assurance
or
want
of
complaisance
in
walking
into
a
room
where
they
are
without
it
instead
of
apologising
for
the
mistake
and
from
finding
one
aspersion
false
doubting
all
the
rest
they
are
only
the
more
confirmed
in
the
remainder
from
being
deprived
of
one
handle
against
you
and
resent
their
disappointment
instead
of
being
ashamed
of
their
credulity
people
talk
of
the
bigotry
of
the
catholics
and
treat
with
contempt
the
absurd
claim
of
the
popes
to
infallibility
i
think
with
little
right
to
do
so
walk
into
a
church
in
paris
you
are
struck
with
a
number
of
idle
forms
and
ceremonies
the
chanting
of
the
service
in
latin
the
shifting
of
the
surplices
the
sprinkling
of
holy
water
the
painted
windows
a
dim
religious
light
the
wax
tapers
the
pealing
organ
the
common
people
seem
attentive
and
devout
and
to
put
entire
faith
in
all
this
why
because
they
imagine
others
to
do
so
they
see
and
hear
certain
signs
and
supposed
evidences
of
it
and
it
amuses
and
fills
up
the
void
of
the
mind
the
love
of
the
mysterious
and
wonderful
to
lend
their
assent
to
it
they
have
assuredly
in
general
no
better
reason
all
our
protestant
divines
will
tell
you
so
well
step
out
of
the
church
of
roche
and
drop
into
an
english
hard
by
what
are
you
the
better
you
see
a
dozen
or
score
of
your
countrymen
with
their
faces
fixed
and
their
eyes
glued
to
a
newspaper
a
magazine
a
review
reading
swallowing
profoundly
ruminating
on
the
lie
the
cant
the
sophism
of
the
day
why
it
saves
them
the
trouble
of
thinking
it
gratifies
their
and
keeps
off
does
a
gleam
of
doubt
an
air
of
ridicule
or
a
glance
of
impatience
pass
across
their
features
at
the
shallow
and
monstrous
things
they
find
no
it
is
all
passive
faith
and
dull
security
they
can
not
take
their
eyes
from
the
page
they
can
not
live
without
it
they
believe
in
their
adopted
oracle
you
see
it
in
their
faces
as
implicitly
as
in
sir
john
barleycorn
as
in
a
sirloin
of
beef
as
in
as
they
hope
to
receive
their
rents
or
to
see
old
england
again
are
not
the
popes
the
fathers
the
councils
as
good
as
their
oracles
and
champions
they
know
the
paper
before
them
to
be
a
hoax
but
do
they
believe
in
the
ribaldry
the
calumny
the
less
on
that
account
they
believe
the
more
in
it
because
it
is
got
up
solely
and
expressly
to
serve
a
cause
that
needs
such
support
and
they
swear
by
whatever
is
devoted
to
this
object
the
greater
the
profligacy
the
effrontery
the
servility
the
greater
the
faith
strange
that
the
british
public
whether
at
home
or
abroad
should
shake
their
heads
at
the
lady
of
loretto
and
repose
deliciously
on
theodore
hook
it
may
well
be
thought
that
the
enlightened
part
of
the
british
public
persons
of
family
and
fortunes
who
have
had
a
college
education
and
received
the
benefit
of
foreign
travel
see
through
the
quackery
which
they
encourage
for
a
political
purpose
without
being
themselves
the
dupes
of
it
this
scarcely
mends
the
matter
suppose
an
individual
of
whom
it
has
been
repeatedly
asserted
that
he
has
warts
on
his
nose
were
to
enter
the
aforesaid
is
there
a
single
country
squire
who
would
not
be
surprised
at
not
finding
this
story
true
would
not
persuade
himself
five
minutes
after
that
he
could
not
have
seen
correctly
or
that
some
art
had
been
used
to
conceal
the
defects
or
would
be
led
to
doubt
from
this
instance
the
general
candour
and
veracity
of
his
oracle
he
would
disbelieve
his
own
senses
rather
seeing
is
believing
it
is
said
lying
is
believing
i
say
we
do
not
even
see
with
our
own
eyes
but
must
and
shut
our
apprehension
up
that
we
may
be
able
to
agree
to
the
report
of
others
as
a
piece
of
good
manners
and
a
point
of
established
etiquette
besides
the
supposed
deformity
answered
his
wishes
the
abuse
fed
fat
the
ancient
grudge
he
owed
some
presumptuous
scribbler
for
not
agreeing
in
a
number
of
points
with
his
betters
it
gave
him
a
personal
advantage
over
a
man
he
did
not
like
and
who
will
give
up
what
tends
to
strengthen
his
aversion
for
another
to
tory
prejudice
dire
as
it
is
to
english
imagination
morbid
as
it
is
a
nickname
a
ludicrous
epithet
a
malignant
falsehood
when
it
has
been
once
propagated
and
taken
to
the
bosom
as
a
welcome
consolation
becomes
a
precious
property
a
vested
right
and
people
would
as
soon
give
up
a
sinecure
or
a
share
in
a
close
borough
as
this
sort
of
plenary
indulgence
to
speak
and
think
with
contempt
of
those
who
would
abolish
the
one
or
throw
open
the
other
is
the
best
reason
in
the
world
for
personal
antipathy
and
vulgar
abuse
do
you
not
think
sir
some
dialectician
may
ask
belief
is
involuntary
and
that
we
judge
in
all
cases
according
to
the
precise
degree
of
evidence
and
the
positive
facts
before
us
no
sir
believe
then
in
the
doctrine
of
philosophical
indeed
sir
i
do
not
then
sir
am
i
to
understand
so
unaccountable
a
diversity
of
opinion
from
the
most
approved
writers
on
the
philosophy
of
the
human
mind
may
i
ask
my
dear
sir
did
you
ever
read
wordsworth
poem
of
can
not
charge
my
memory
with
the
fact
well
sir
this
michael
is
an
old
shepherd
who
has
a
son
who
goes
to
sea
and
who
turns
out
a
great
reprobate
by
all
the
accounts
received
of
him
before
he
went
however
the
father
took
the
boy
with
him
into
a
and
made
him
lay
the
first
stone
of
a
which
was
to
be
a
covenant
and
a
remembrance
between
them
if
anything
ill
happened
for
years
after
the
old
man
used
to
go
and
work
at
the
the
rocks
he
went
and
still
look
up
upon
the
sun
and
listen
to
the
wind
and
sat
by
the
work
expecting
the
lad
return
or
hoping
to
hear
some
better
tidings
of
him
was
this
hope
founded
on
reason
or
was
it
not
owing
to
the
strength
of
affection
which
in
spite
of
everything
could
not
relinquish
its
hold
of
a
favourite
object
indeed
the
only
one
that
bound
it
to
existence
not
being
able
to
make
my
dialectician
answer
kindly
to
interrogatories
i
must
get
on
without
him
in
matters
of
absolute
demonstration
and
speculative
indifferences
i
grant
that
belief
is
involuntary
and
the
proof
not
to
be
resisted
but
then
in
such
matters
there
is
no
difference
of
opinion
or
the
difference
is
adjusted
amicably
and
rationally
hobbes
is
of
opinion
that
if
their
passions
or
interests
could
be
implicated
in
the
question
men
would
deny
stoutly
that
the
three
angles
of
a
triangle
are
equal
to
two
right
ones
and
the
disputes
in
religion
look
something
like
it
i
only
contend
however
that
in
all
cases
not
of
this
peremptory
and
determinate
cast
and
where
disputes
commonly
arise
inclination
habit
and
example
have
a
powerful
share
in
throwing
in
the
to
our
opinions
and
that
he
who
is
only
tolerably
free
from
these
and
not
their
regular
dupe
or
slave
is
indeed
man
of
ten
thousand
take
for
instance
the
example
of
a
catholic
clergyman
in
a
popish
country
it
will
generally
be
found
that
he
lives
and
dies
in
the
faith
in
which
he
was
brought
up
as
the
protestant
clergyman
does
in
his
shall
we
say
that
the
necessity
of
gaining
a
livelihood
or
the
prospect
of
preferment
that
the
early
bias
given
to
his
mind
by
education
and
study
the
pride
of
victory
the
shame
of
defeat
the
example
and
encouragement
of
all
about
him
the
respect
and
love
of
his
flock
the
flattering
notice
of
the
great
have
no
effect
in
giving
consistency
to
his
opinions
and
carrying
them
through
to
the
last
yet
who
will
suppose
that
in
either
case
this
apparent
uniformity
is
mere
hypocrisy
or
that
the
intellects
of
the
two
classes
of
divines
are
naturally
adapted
to
the
arguments
in
favour
of
the
two
religions
they
have
occasion
to
profess
no
but
the
understanding
takes
a
tincture
from
outward
impulses
and
circumstances
and
is
led
to
dwell
on
those
suggestions
which
favour
and
to
blind
itself
to
the
objections
which
impugn
the
side
to
which
it
previously
and
morally
inclines
again
even
in
those
who
oppose
established
opinions
and
form
the
little
firm
formidable
phalanx
of
dissent
have
not
early
instruction
spiritual
pride
the
love
of
contradiction
a
resistance
to
usurped
authority
as
much
to
do
with
keeping
up
the
war
of
sects
and
schisms
as
the
abstract
love
of
truth
or
conviction
of
the
understanding
does
not
persecution
fan
the
flame
in
such
fiery
tempers
and
does
it
not
expire
or
grow
lukewarm
with
indulgence
and
neglect
i
have
a
sneaking
kindness
for
a
popish
priest
in
this
country
and
to
a
catholic
peer
i
would
willingly
bow
in
passing
what
are
national
antipathies
individual
attachments
but
so
many
expressions
of
the
principle
in
forming
our
opinions
all
our
opinions
become
grounds
on
which
we
act
and
build
our
expectations
of
good
or
ill
and
this
good
or
ill
mixed
up
with
them
is
soon
changed
into
the
ruling
principle
which
modifies
or
violently
supersedes
the
original
cool
determination
of
the
reason
and
senses
the
will
when
it
once
gets
a
footing
turns
the
sober
judgment
out
of
doors
if
we
form
an
attachment
to
any
one
are
we
not
slow
in
giving
it
up
or
if
our
suspicions
are
once
excited
are
we
not
equally
rash
and
violent
in
believing
the
worst
othello
characterises
himself
as
one
loved
not
wisely
but
too
well
of
one
not
easily
jealous
but
being
wrought
perplex
in
the
extreme
and
this
answers
to
the
movements
and
irregularities
of
passion
and
opinion
which
take
place
in
human
nature
if
we
wish
a
thing
we
are
disposed
to
believe
it
if
we
have
been
accustomed
to
believe
it
we
are
the
more
obstinate
in
defending
it
on
that
account
if
all
the
world
differ
from
us
in
any
question
of
moment
we
are
ashamed
to
own
it
or
are
hurried
by
peevishness
and
irritation
into
extravagance
and
paradox
the
weight
of
example
presses
upon
us
whether
we
feel
it
or
not
like
the
law
of
gravitation
he
who
sustains
his
opinion
by
the
strength
of
conviction
and
evidence
alone
unmoved
by
ridicule
neglect
obloquy
or
privation
shows
no
less
resolution
than
the
hindoo
who
makes
and
keeps
a
vow
to
hold
his
right
arm
in
the
air
till
it
grows
rigid
and
callous
to
have
all
the
world
against
us
is
trying
to
a
man
temper
and
philosophy
it
unhinges
even
our
opinion
of
our
own
motives
and
intentions
it
is
like
striking
the
actual
world
from
under
our
feet
the
void
that
is
left
the
pause
the
chilling
suspense
is
fearful
the
growth
of
an
opinion
is
like
the
growth
of
a
limb
it
receives
its
actual
support
and
nourishment
from
the
general
body
of
the
opinions
feelings
and
practice
of
the
world
without
that
it
soon
withers
festers
and
becomes
useless
to
what
purpose
write
a
good
book
if
it
is
sure
to
be
pronounced
a
bad
one
even
before
it
is
read
if
our
thoughts
are
to
be
blown
stifling
back
upon
ourselves
why
utter
them
at
all
it
is
only
exposing
what
we
love
most
to
contumely
and
insult
and
thus
depriving
ourselves
of
our
own
relish
and
satisfaction
in
them
language
is
only
made
to
communicate
our
sentiments
and
if
we
can
find
no
one
to
receive
them
we
are
reduced
to
the
silence
of
dumbness
we
live
but
in
the
solitude
of
a
dungeon
if
we
do
not
vindicate
our
opinions
we
seem
poor
creatures
who
have
no
right
to
them
if
we
speak
out
we
are
involved
in
continual
brawls
and
controversy
if
we
contemn
what
others
admire
we
make
ourselves
odious
if
we
admire
what
they
despise
we
are
equally
ridiculous
we
have
not
the
applause
of
the
world
nor
the
support
of
a
party
we
can
neither
enjoy
the
freedom
of
social
intercourse
nor
the
calm
of
privacy
with
our
respect
for
others
we
lose
confidence
in
ourselves
everything
seems
to
be
a
subject
of
litigation
to
want
proof
or
confirmation
we
doubt
by
degrees
whether
we
stand
on
our
head
or
our
heels
whether
we
know
our
right
hand
from
our
left
if
i
am
assured
that
i
never
wrote
a
sentence
of
common
english
in
my
life
how
can
i
know
that
this
is
not
the
case
if
i
am
told
at
one
time
that
my
writings
are
as
heavy
as
lead
and
at
another
that
they
are
more
light
and
flimsy
than
the
gossamer
what
resource
have
i
but
to
choose
between
the
two
i
could
say
if
this
were
the
place
what
those
writings
it
the
place
and
never
stand
upon
punctilio
they
are
not
then
so
properly
the
works
of
an
author
by
profession
as
the
thoughts
of
a
metaphysician
expressed
by
a
painter
they
are
subtle
and
difficult
problems
translated
into
hieroglyphics
i
thought
for
several
years
on
the
hardest
subjects
on
fate
foreknowledge
absolute
without
ever
making
use
of
words
or
images
at
all
and
that
has
made
them
come
in
such
throngs
and
confused
heaps
when
i
burst
from
that
void
of
abstraction
in
proportion
to
the
tenuity
to
which
my
ideas
had
been
drawn
and
my
abstinence
from
ornament
and
sensible
objects
was
the
tenaciousness
with
which
actual
circumstances
and
picturesque
imagery
laid
hold
of
my
mind
when
i
turned
my
attention
to
them
or
had
to
look
round
for
illustrations
till
i
began
to
paint
or
till
i
became
acquainted
with
the
author
of
ancient
i
could
neither
write
nor
speak
he
encouraged
me
to
write
a
book
which
i
did
according
to
the
original
bent
of
my
mind
making
it
as
dry
and
meagre
as
i
could
so
that
it
fell
from
the
press
and
none
of
those
who
abuse
me
for
a
shallow
writer
have
so
much
as
heard
of
it
yet
let
me
say
that
work
contains
an
important
metaphysical
discovery
supported
by
a
continuous
and
severe
train
of
reasoning
nearly
as
subtle
and
original
as
anything
in
hume
or
berkeley
i
am
not
accustomed
to
speak
of
myself
in
this
manner
but
impudence
may
provoke
modesty
to
justify
itself
finding
this
method
did
not
answer
i
despaired
for
a
time
but
some
trifle
i
wrote
in
the
meeting
the
approbation
of
the
editor
and
the
town
i
resolved
to
turn
over
a
new
leaf
to
take
the
public
at
its
word
to
muster
all
the
tropes
and
figures
i
could
lay
hands
on
and
though
i
am
a
plain
man
never
to
appear
abroad
but
in
an
embroidered
dress
still
old
habits
will
prevail
and
i
hardly
ever
set
about
a
paragraph
or
a
criticism
but
there
was
an
undercurrent
of
thought
or
some
generic
distinction
on
which
the
whole
turned
having
got
my
clue
i
had
no
difficulty
in
stringing
pearls
upon
it
and
the
more
recondite
the
point
the
more
i
laboured
to
bring
it
out
and
set
it
off
by
a
variety
of
ornaments
and
allusions
this
puzzled
the
scribes
whose
business
it
was
to
crush
me
they
could
not
see
the
meaning
they
would
not
see
the
colouring
for
it
hurt
their
eyes
one
cried
out
it
was
dull
another
that
it
was
too
fine
by
half
my
friends
took
up
this
last
alternative
as
the
most
favourable
and
since
then
it
has
been
agreed
that
i
am
a
florid
writer
somewhat
flighty
and
paradoxical
yet
when
i
wished
to
unburthen
my
mind
in
the
by
an
article
on
english
metaphysics
the
editor
who
echoes
this
charge
said
he
preferred
what
i
wrote
for
effect
and
was
afraid
of
its
being
thought
heavy
i
have
accounted
for
the
flowers
the
paradoxes
may
be
accounted
for
in
the
same
way
all
abstract
reasoning
is
in
extremes
or
only
takes
up
one
view
of
a
question
or
what
is
called
the
principle
of
the
thing
and
if
you
want
to
give
this
popularity
and
effect
you
are
in
danger
of
running
into
extravagance
and
hyperbole
i
have
had
to
bring
out
some
obscure
distinction
or
to
combat
some
strong
prejudice
and
in
doing
this
with
all
my
might
may
have
often
overshot
the
mark
it
was
easy
to
correct
the
excess
of
truth
afterwards
i
have
been
accused
of
inconsistency
for
writing
an
essay
for
instance
on
the
of
and
another
on
the
of
the
as
if
ignorance
had
not
its
comforts
as
well
as
knowledge
the
personalities
i
have
fallen
into
have
never
been
gratuitous
if
i
have
sacrificed
my
friends
it
has
always
been
to
a
theory
i
have
been
found
fault
with
for
repeating
myself
and
for
a
narrow
range
of
ideas
to
a
want
of
general
reading
i
plead
guilty
and
am
sorry
for
it
but
perhaps
if
i
had
read
more
i
might
have
thought
less
as
to
my
barrenness
of
invention
i
have
at
least
glanced
over
a
number
of
subjects
painting
poetry
prose
plays
politics
parliamentary
speakers
metaphysical
lore
books
men
and
things
there
is
some
point
some
fancy
some
feeling
some
taste
shown
in
treating
of
these
which
of
my
conclusions
has
been
reversed
is
it
what
i
said
ten
years
ago
of
the
bourbons
which
raised
the
against
me
surely
all
the
world
are
of
that
opinion
now
i
have
then
given
proofs
of
some
talent
and
of
more
honesty
if
there
is
haste
or
want
of
method
there
is
no
commonplace
nor
a
line
that
licks
the
dust
and
if
i
do
not
appear
to
more
advantage
i
at
least
appear
such
as
i
am
if
the
editor
of
the
will
do
me
the
favour
to
look
over
my
on
the
principles
of
human
will
dip
into
any
essay
i
ever
wrote
and
will
take
a
sponge
and
clear
the
dust
from
the
face
of
my
i
hope
he
will
upon
second
thoughts
acquit
me
of
an
absolute
dearth
of
resources
and
want
of
versatility
in
the
direction
of
my
studies
footnote
the
only
friends
whom
we
defend
with
zeal
and
obstinacy
are
our
relations
they
seem
part
of
ourselves
for
our
other
friends
we
are
only
answerable
so
long
as
we
countenance
them
and
therefore
cut
the
connection
as
soon
as
possible

who
ever
willingly

up
the
good

of

three
of
us
are

i
were
not
alexander
i
would
be
diogenes
said
the
macedonian

and
the
cynic
might
have
retorted
the
compliment
upon
the
prince
by
saying
that
he
not
diogenes
he
would
be
alexander
this
is
the
universal
exception
the
invariable
reservation
that
our
makes
the
utmost
point
at
which
our
admiration
or
envy
ever
arrives
to
wish
if
we
were
not
ourselves
to
be
some
other
individual
no
one
ever
wishes
to
be
another
of
himself
we
may
feel
a
desire
to
change
places
with
others
to
have
one
fortune
another
health
or
strength
his
wit
or
learning
or
accomplishments
of
various
kinds
to
be
like
one
more
rich
in
hope
featured
like
him
like
him
with
friends
possessed
desiring
this
man
art
and
that
man
scope
but
we
would
still
be
ourselves
to
possess
and
enjoy
all
these
or
we
would
not
give
a
doit
for
them
but
on
this
supposition
what
in
truth
should
we
be
the
better
for
them
it
is
not
we
but
another
that
would
reap
the
benefit
and
what
do
we
care
about
that
other
in
that
case
the
present
owner
might
as
well
continue
to
enjoy
them
should
not
be
gainers
by
the
change
if
the
meanest
beggar
who
crouches
at
a
palace
gate
and
looks
up
with
awe
and
suppliant
fear
to
the
proud
inmate
as
he
passes
could
be
put
in
possession
of
all
the
finery
the
pomp
the
luxury
and
wealth
that
he
sees
and
envies
on
the
sole
condition
of
getting
rid
together
with
his
rags
and
misery
of
all
recollection
that
there
ever
was
such
a
wretch
as
himself
he
would
reject
the
proffered
boon
with
scorn
he
might
be
glad
to
change
situations
but
he
would
insist
on
keeping
his
own
thoughts
to
and
point
the
transition
by
the
force
of
contrast
he
would
not
on
any
account
forego
his
on
the
unexpected
accession
of
good
fortune
and
his
escape
from
past
suffering
all
that
excites
his
cupidity
his
envy
his
repining
or
despair
is
the
alternative
of
some
great
good
to
himself
and
if
in
order
to
attain
that
object
he
is
to
part
with
his
own
existence
to
take
that
of
another
he
can
feel
no
farther
interest
in
it
this
is
the
language
both
of
passion
and
reason
here
lies
rub
that
makes
calamity
of
so
long
life
for
it
is
not
barely
the
apprehension
of
the
ills
that
that
sleep
of
death
may
come
but
also
our
ignorance
and
indifference
to
the
promised
good
that
produces
our
repugnance
and
backwardness
to
quit
the
present
scene
no
man
if
he
had
his
choice
would
be
the
angel
gabriel
what
is
the
angel
gabriel
to
him
but
a
splendid
vision
he
might
as
well
have
an
ambition
to
be
turned
into
a
bright
cloud
or
a
particular
star
the
interpretation
of
which
is
he
can
have
no
sympathy
with
the
angel
gabriel
before
he
can
be
transformed
into
so
bright
and
ethereal
an
essence
he
must
necessarily
off
this
mortal
coil
be
divested
of
all
his
old
habits
passions
thoughts
and
feelings
to
be
endowed
with
other
attributes
lofty
and
beatific
of
which
he
has
no
notion
and
therefore
he
would
rather
remain
a
little
longer
in
this
mansion
of
clay
which
with
all
its
flaws
inconveniences
and
perplexities
contains
all
that
he
has
any
real
knowledge
of
or
any
affection
for
when
indeed
he
is
about
to
quit
it
in
spite
of
himself
and
has
no
other
chance
left
to
escape
the
darkness
of
the
tomb
he
may
then
have
no
objection
making
a
virtue
of
necessity
to
put
on
angel
wings
to
have
radiant
locks
to
wear
a
wreath
of
amaranth
and
thus
to
masquerade
it
in
the
skies
it
is
an
instance
of
the
truthful
beauty
of
the
ancient
mythology
that
the
various
transmutations
it
recounts
are
never
voluntary
or
of
favourable
omen
but
are
interposed
as
a
timely
release
to
those
who
driven
on
by
fate
and
urged
to
the
last
extremity
of
fear
or
anguish
are
turned
into
a
flower
a
plant
an
animal
a
star
a
precious
stone
or
into
some
object
that
may
inspire
pity
or
mitigate
our
regret
for
their
misfortunes
narcissus
was
transformed
into
a
flower
daphne
into
a
laurel
arethusa
into
a
fountain
by
the
favour
of
the
gods
but
not
till
no
other
remedy
was
left
for
their
despair
it
is
a
sort
of
smiling
cheat
upon
death
and
graceful
compromise
with
annihilation
it
is
better
to
exist
by
proxy
in
some
softened
type
and
soothing
allegory
than
not
at
all
to
breathe
in
a
flower
or
shine
in
a
constellation
than
to
be
utterly
forgot
but
no
one
would
change
his
natural
condition
if
he
could
help
it
for
that
of
a
bird
an
insect
a
beast
or
a
fish
however
delightful
their
mode
of
existence
or
however
enviable
he
might
deem
their
lot
compared
to
his
own
their
thoughts
are
not
our
thoughts
their
happiness
is
not
our
happiness
nor
can
we
enter
into
it
except
with
a
passing
smile
of
approbation
or
as
a
refinement
of
fancy
as
the
poet
sings
more
felicity
can
fall
to
creature
than
to
enjoy
delight
with
liberty
and
to
be
lord
of
all
the
works
of
nature
to
reign
in
the
air
from
earth
to
highest
sky
to
feed
on
flowers
and
weeds
of
glorious
feature
to
taste
whatever
thing
doth
please
the
eye
who
rests
not
pleased
with
such
happiness
well
worthy
he
to
taste
of
wretchedness
this
is
gorgeous
description
and
fine
declamation
yet
who
would
be
found
to
act
upon
it
even
in
the
forming
of
a
wish
or
would
not
rather
be
the
thrall
of
wretchedness
than
launch
out
by
the
aid
of
some
magic
spell
into
all
the
delights
of
such
a
butterfly
state
of
existence
the
french
if
any
people
can
may
be
said
to
enjoy
this
airy
heedless
gaiety
and
unalloyed
exuberance
of
satisfaction
yet
what
englishman
would
deliberately
change
with
them
we
would
sooner
be
miserable
after
our
own
fashion
than
happy
after
theirs
it
is
not
happiness
then
in
the
abstract
which
we
seek
that
can
be
addressed
as
something
still
that
prompts
th
eternal
sigh
for
which
we
wish
to
live
or
dare
to
die
but
a
happiness
suited
to
our
tastes
and
faculties
that
has
become
a
part
of
ourselves
by
habit
and
enjoyment
that
is
endeared
to
us
by
a
thousand
recollections
privations
and
sufferings
no
one
then
would
willingly
change
his
country
or
his
kind
for
the
most
plausible
pretences
held
out
to
him
the
most
humiliating
punishment
inflicted
in
ancient
fable
is
the
change
of
sex
not
that
it
was
any
degradation
in
itself
but
that
it
must
occasion
a
total
derangement
of
the
moral
economy
and
confusion
of
the
sense
of
personal
propriety
the
thing
is
said
to
have
happened
sens
in
our
time
the
story
is
to
be
met
with
in
choice
italian
and
lord
d
tells
it
in
very
plain
english
we
may
often
find
ourselves
envying
the
possessions
of
others
and
sometimes
inadvertently
indulging
a
wish
to
change
places
with
them
altogether
but
our
soon
discovers
some
excuse
to
be
off
the
bargain
we
were
ready
to
strike
and
retracts
made
in
haste
as
violent
and
void
we
might
make
up
our
minds
to
the
alteration
in
every
other
particular
but
when
it
comes
to
the
point
there
is
sure
to
be
some
trait
or
feature
of
character
in
the
object
of
our
admiration
to
which
we
can
not
reconcile
ourselves
some
favourite
quality
or
darling
foible
of
our
own
with
which
we
can
by
no
means
resolve
to
part
the
more
enviable
the
situation
of
another
the
more
entirely
to
our
taste
the
more
reluctant
we
are
to
leave
any
part
of
ourselves
behind
that
would
be
so
fully
capable
of
appreciating
all
the
exquisiteness
of
its
new
situation
or
not
to
enter
into
the
possession
of
such
an
imaginary
reversion
of
good
fortune
with
all
our
previous
inclinations
and
sentiments
the
outward
circumstances
were
fine
they
only
wanted
a
to
enjoy
them
and
that
soul
is
ours
as
the
costly
ring
wants
the
peerless
jewel
to
perfect
and
set
it
off
the
humble
prayer
and
petition
to
sneak
into
visionary
felicity
by
personal
adoption
or
the
surrender
of
our
own
personal
pretentions
always
ends
in
a
daring
project
of
usurpation
and
a
determination
to
expel
the
actual
proprietor
and
supply
his
place
so
much
more
worthily
with
our
own
identity
not
bating
a
single
jot
of
it
thus
in
passing
through
a
fine
collection
of
pictures
who
has
not
envied
the
privilege
of
visiting
it
every
day
and
wished
to
be
the
owner
but
the
rising
sigh
is
soon
checked
and
native
hue
of
emulation
is
sicklied
with
the
pale
cast
of
thought
when
we
come
to
ask
ourselves
not
merely
whether
the
owner
has
any
taste
at
all
for
these
splendid
works
and
does
not
look
upon
them
as
so
much
expensive
furniture
like
his
chairs
and
tables
but
whether
he
has
the
same
precise
and
only
true
taste
that
we
have
whether
he
has
the
very
same
favourites
that
we
have
whether
he
may
not
be
so
blind
as
to
prefer
a
vandyke
to
a
titian
a
ruysdael
to
a
claude
nay
whether
he
may
not
have
other
pursuits
and
avocations
that
draw
off
his
attention
from
the
sole
objects
of
our
idolatry
and
which
seem
to
us
mere
impertinences
and
waste
of
time
in
that
case
we
at
once
lose
all
patience
and
exclaim
indignantly
us
back
our
taste
and
keep
your
pictures
it
is
not
we
who
should
envy
them
the
possession
of
the
treasure
but
they
who
should
envy
us
the
true
and
exclusive
enjoyment
of
it
a
similar
train
of
feeling
seems
to
have
dictated
warton
spirited
on
visiting
wilton
pembroke
princely

where
mimic
art
decks
with
a
magic
hand
the
dazzling
bowers
its
living
hues
where
the
warm
pencil
pours
and
breathing
forms
from
the
rude
marble
start
how
to
life
humbler
scene
can
i
depart
my
breast
all
glowing
from
those
gorgeous
towers
in
my
low
cell
how

the
sullen
hours

for

its
ruinous

to
the
genial

or
embrowned
with
here
one
would
be
glad
to
spend
one
life
up
in
measureless
content
and
to
grow
old
beneath
ancestral
oaks
instead
of
gaining
a
precarious
irksome
and
despised
livelihood
by
indulging
romantic
sentiments
and
writing
disjointed
descriptions
of
them
the
thought
has
scarcely
risen
to
the
lips
when
we
learn
that
the
owner
of
so
blissful
a
seclusion
is
a
thoroughbred
a
preserver
of
the
game
a
brawling
electioneerer
a
tory
member
of
parliament
a
man
sooner

and

the

who
would
be
sir
thomas
lethbridge
for
his
title
and
estate
asks
one
man
but
would
not
almost
any
one
wish
to
be
sir
francis
burdett
the
man
of
the
people
the
idol
of
the
electors
of
westminster
says
another
i
can
only
answer
for
myself
respectable
and
honest
as
he
is
there
is
something
in
his
white
boots
and
white
breeches
and
white
coat
and
white
hair
and
white
hat
and
red
face
that
i
can
not
by
any
effort
of
candour
confound
my
personal
identity
with
if
can
prevail
on
sir
francis
to
exchange
let
him
do
so
by
all
means
perhaps
they
might
contrive
to
a
soul
between
them
could
i
have
had
my
will
i
should
have
been
born
a
lord
but
one
would
not
be
a
booby
lord
neither
i
am
haunted
by
an
odd
fancy
of
driving
down
the
great
north
road
in
a
chaise
and
four
about
fifty
years
ago
and
coming
to
the
inn
at
with
outriders
white
favours
and
a
coronet
on
the
panels
and
then
too
i
choose
my
companion
in
the
coach
really
there
is
a
witchcraft
in
all
this
that
makes
it
necessary
to
turn
away
from
it
lest
in
the
conflict
between
imagination
and
impossibility
i
should
grow
feverish
and
but
on
the
other
hand
if
one
was
a
born
lord
should
one
have
the
same
idea
that
every
one
else
has
of
peeress
in
her
own
is
not
distance
giddy
elevation
mysterious
awe
an
impassable
gulf
necessary
to
form
this
idea
in
the
mind
that
fine
ligament
of
braid
that
lets
down
heaven
upon
earth
fair
as
enchantment
soft
as
berenice
hair
bright
and
garlanded
like
ariadne
crown
and
is
it
not
better
to
have
had
this
idea
all
through
life
to
have
caught
but
glimpses
of
it
to
have
known
it
but
in
a
dream
than
to
have
been
born
a
lord
ten
times
over
with
twenty
pampered
menials
at
one
beck
and
twenty
descents
to
boast
of
it
is
the
envy
of
certain
privileges
the
sharp
privations
we
have
undergone
the
cutting
neglect
we
have
met
with
from
the
want
of
birth
or
title
that
gives
its
zest
to
the
distinction
the
thing
itself
may
be
indifferent
or
contemptible
enough
it
is
the
a
lord
that
is
to
be
desired
but
he
who
becomes
a
lord
in
reality
may
be
an
upstart
a
mere
pretender
without
the
sterling
essence
so
that
all
that
is
of
any
worth
in
this
supposed
transition
is
purely
imaginary
and
impossible
kings
are
so
accustomed
to
look
down
on
all
the
rest
of
the
world
that
they
consider
the
condition
of
mortality
as
vile
and
intolerable
if
stripped
of
royal
state
and
cry
out
in
the
bitterness
of
their
despair
me
a
crown
or
a
tomb
it
should
seem
from
this
as
if
all
mankind
would
change
with
the
first
crowned
head
that
could
propose
the
alternative
or
that
it
would
be
only
the
presumption
of
the
supposition
or
a
sense
of
their
own
unworthiness
that
would
deter
them
perhaps
there
is
not
a
single
throne
that
if
it
was
to
be
filled
by
this
sort
of
voluntary
metempsychosis
would
not
remain
empty
many
would
no
doubt
be
glad
to
be
feared
and
kill
with
looks
in
their
own
persons
and
after
their
own
fashion
but
who
would
be
the
of
those
shadows
of
a
shade
those
transmitters
of
a
foolish
face
charles
and
ferdinand
if
monarchs
have
little
sympathy
with
mankind
mankind
have
even
less
with
monarchs
they
are
merely
to
us
a
sort
of
or
royal
which
we
may
gaze
at
with
superstitious
wonder
but
have
no
wish
to
become
and
he
who
should
meditate
such
a
change
must
not
only
feel
by
anticipation
an
utter
contempt
for
the
of
humanity
which
he
is
prepared
to
cast
but
must
feel
an
absolute
void
and
want
of
attraction
in
those
lofty
and
incomprehensible
sentiments
which
are
to
supply
its
place
with
respect
to
actual
royalty
the
spell
is
in
a
great
measure
broken
but
among
ancient
monarchs
there
is
no
one
i
think
who
envies
darius
or
xerxes
one
has
a
different
feeling
with
respect
to
alexander
or
pyrrhus
but
this
is
because
they
were
great
men
as
well
as
great
kings
and
the
soul
is
up
in
arms
at
the
mention
of
their
names
as
at
the
sound
of
a
trumpet
but
as
to
all
the
rest
those
the
catalogue
who
go
for
kings
the
praying
eating
drinking
dressing
monarchs
of
the
earth
in
time
past
or
present
one
would
as
soon
think
of
wishing
to
personate
the
golden
calf
or
to
turn
out
with
nebuchadnezzar
to
graze
as
to
be
transformed
into
one
of
that
multitude
there
is
no
point
of
affinity
the
extrinsic
circumstances
are
imposing
but
within
there
is
nothing
but
morbid
humours
and
proud
flesh
some
persons
might
vote
for
charlemagne
and
there
are
others
who
would
have
no
objection
to
be
the
modern
charlemagne
with
all
he
inflicted
and
suffered
even
after
the
necromantic
field
of
waterloo
and
the
bloody
wreath
on
the
vacant
brow
of
the
conqueror
and
that
fell
jailer
set
over
him
by
a
craven
foe
that
round
his
soul
and
mocked
his
closing
eyelids
it
has
been
remarked
that
could
we
at
pleasure
change
our
situation
in
life
more
persons
would
be
found
anxious
to
descend
than
to
ascend
in
the
scale
of
society
one
reason
may
be
that
we
have
it
more
in
our
power
to
do
so
and
this
encourages
the
thought
and
makes
it
familiar
to
us
a
second
is
that
we
naturally
wish
to
throw
off
the
cares
of
state
of
fortune
or
business
that
oppress
us
and
to
seek
repose
before
we
find
it
in
the
grave
a
third
reason
is
that
as
we
descend
to
common
life
the
pleasures
are
simple
natural
such
as
all
can
enter
into
and
therefore
excite
a
general
interest
and
combine
all
suffrages
of
the
different
occupations
of
life
none
is
beheld
with
a
more
pleasing
emotion
or
less
aversion
to
a
change
for
our
own
than
that
of
a
shepherd
tending
his
flock
the
pastoral
ages
have
been
the
envy
and
the
theme
of
all
succeeding
ones
and
a
beggar
with
his
crutch
is
more
closely
allied
than
the
monarch
and
his
crown
to
the
associations
of
mirth
and
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
admitted
that
our
pride
is
too
apt
to
prefer
grandeur
to
happiness
and
that
our
passions
make
us
envy
great
vices
oftener
than
great
virtues
the
world
show
their
sense
in
nothing
more
than
in
a
distrust
and
aversion
to
those
changes
of
situation
which
only
tend
to
make
the
successful
candidates
ridiculous
and
which
do
not
carry
along
with
them
a
mind
adequate
to
the
circumstances
the
common
people
in
this
respect
are
more
shrewd
and
judicious
than
their
superiors
from
feeling
their
own
awkwardness
and
incapacity
and
often
decline
with
an
instinctive
modesty
the
troublesome
honours
intended
for
them
they
do
not
overlook
their
original
defects
so
readily
as
others
overlook
their
acquired
advantages
it
is
not
wonderful
therefore
that
and
dancers
refuse
or
only
as
it
were
to
accept
lords
though
the
latter
are
too
often
fascinated
by
them
the
fair
performer
knows
better
than
her
unsuspecting
admirer
how
little
connection
there
is
between
the
dazzling
figure
she
makes
on
the
stage
and
that
which
she
may
make
in
private
life
and
is
in
no
hurry
to
convert
into
a
the
nobleman
supposing
him
not
to
be
very
wise
is
astonished
at
the
miraculous
powers
of
art
in
fair
the
chaste
the
inexpressive
and
thinks
such
a
paragon
must
easily
conform
to
the
routine
of
manners
and
society
which
every
trifling
woman
of
quality
of
his
acquaintance
from
sixteen
to
sixty
goes
through
without
effort
this
is
a
hasty
or
a
wilful
conclusion
things
of
habit
only
come
by
habit
and
inspiration
here
avails
nothing
a
man
of
fortune
who
marries
an
actress
for
her
fine
performance
of
tragedy
has
been
well
compared
to
the
person
who
bought
punch
the
lady
is
not
unfrequently
aware
of
the
inconsequentiality
and
unwilling
to
be
put
on
the
shelf
and
hid
in
the
nursery
of
some
musty
country
mansion

girls
of
any
sense
and
spirit
treat
their
masters
who
make
serious
love
to
them
with
suitable
contempt
what
is
it
but
a
proposal
to
drag
an
unmeaning
trollop
at
his
heels
through
life
to
her
own
annoyance
and
the
ridicule
of
all
his
friends
no
woman
i
suspect
ever
forgave
a
man
who
raised
her
from
a
low
condition
in
life
it
is
a
perpetual
obligation
and
reproach
though
i
believe
men
often
feel
the
most
disinterested
regard
for
women
under
such
circumstances
sancho
panza
discovered
no
less
folly
in
his
eagerness
to
enter
upon
his
new
government
than
wisdom
in
quitting
it
as
fast
as
possible
why
will
cobbett
persist
in
getting
into
parliament
he
would
find
himself
no
longer
the
same
man
what
member
of
parliament
i
should
like
to
know
could
write
his
as
a
popular
partisan
he
may
for
aught
i
can
say
be
a
match
for
the
whole
honourable
house
but
by
obtaining
a
seat
in
stephen
chapel
he
would
only
be
equal
to
a
part
of
it
it
was
surely
a
puerile
ambition
in
addington
to
succeed
pitt
as
prime
minister
the
situation
was
only
a
foil
to
his
imbecility
gipsies
have
a
fine
faculty
of
evasion
catch
them
who
can
in
the
same
place
or
story
twice
take
them
teach
them
the
comforts
of
civilisation
confine
them
in
warm
rooms
with
thick
carpets
and
down
beds
and
they
will
fly
out
of
the
window
like
the
bird
described
by
chaucer
out
of
its
golden
cage
i
maintain
that
there
is
no
common
language
or
medium
of
understanding
between
people
of
education
and
without
it
between
those
who
judge
of
things
from
books
or
from
their
senses
ignorance
has
so
far
the
advantage
over
learning
for
it
can
make
an
appeal
to
you
from
what
you
know
but
you
can
not
react
upon
it
through
that
which
it
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
ignorance
is
therefore
power
this
is
what
foiled
buonaparte
in
spain
and
russia
the
people
can
only
be
gained
over
by
informing
them
though
they
may
be
enslaved
by
fraud
or
force
is
it
then
he
does
like
victuals
and
drink
as
if
you
had
these
not
too
but
because
he
has
them
not
he
thinks
of
nothing
else
and
laughs
at
you
and
your
refinements
supposing
you
live
upon
air
to
those
who
are
deprived
of
every
other
advantage
even
nature
is
a
i
have
made
this
capital
mistake
all
my
life
in
imagining
that
those
objects
which
lay
open
to
all
and
excited
an
interest
merely
from
the
of
them
spoke
a
common
language
to
all
and
that
nature
was
a
kind
of
universal
home
where
ages
sexes
classes
meet
not
so
the
vital
air
the
sky
the
woods
the
streams
all
these
go
for
nothing
except
with
a
favoured
few
the
poor
are
taken
up
with
their
bodily
wants
the
rich
with
external
acquisitions
the
one
with
the
sense
of
property
the
other
of
its
privation
both
have
the
same
distaste
for
the
are
the
slaves
of
appearances
the
vulgar
of
necessity
and
neither
has
the
smallest
regard
to
worth
refinement
generosity
all
savages
are
irreclaimable
i
can
understand
the
irish
character
better
than
the
scotch
i
hate
the
formal
crust
of
circumstances
and
the
mechanism
of
society
i
have
been
recommended
indeed
to
settle
down
into
some
respectable
profession
for

why
so
soon
the

tear
i
am
no

to
be
venerable
in
thinking
of
those
one
might
wish
to
have
been

people
will
exclaim
you
would
like
to
have

would
garrick
have
consented
to
the
change
no
nor
should
he
for
the
applause
which
he
received
and
on
which
he
lived
was
more
adapted
to
his
genius
and
taste
if
garrick
had
agreed
to
be
shakspeare
he
would
have
made
it
a
previous
condition
that
he
was
to
be
a
better
player
he
would
have
insisted
on
taking
some
higher
part
than

the

his
companions
at
the
mermaid
would
not
have
known
their
old
friend

in
his
new
disguise
the
modern
roscius
would
have
scouted
the
halting
player
he
would
have
shrunk
from
the
parts
of
the
inspired
poet
if
others
are
unlike
us
we
feel
it
as
a
presumption
and
an
impertinence
to
usurp
their
place
if
they
are
like
us
it
seems
a
work
of
supererogation
we
are
not
to
be
cozened
out
of
our
existence
for
nothing
it
has
been
ingeniously
urged
as
an
objection
to
having
been
milton
that
we
should
not
have
had
the
pleasure
of
reading
perhaps
i
should
incline
to
draw
lots
with
pope
but
that
he
was
deformed
and
did
not
sufficiently
relish
milton
and
shakspeare
as
it
is
we
can
enjoy
his
verses
and
theirs
too
why
having
these
need
we
ever
be
dissatisfied

ourselves

we
easily
grant
may
have
more
wit

beauty
which
we
should
be
glad
to
borrow
of
them
but
that
they
have
sounder
or
better
views
of
things
or
that
we
should
act
wisely
in
changing
in
this
respect
is
what
we
can
by
no
means
persuade
ourselves
we
may
not
be
the
lucky
possessors
of
what
is
best
or
most
desirable
but
our
notion
of
what
is
best
and
most
desirable
we
will
give
up
to
no
man
by
choice
or
compulsion
and
unless
others
the
greatest
wits
or
brightest
geniuses
can
come
into
our
way
of
thinking
we
must
humbly
beg
leave
to
remain
as
we
are
a
calvinistic
preacher
would
not
relinquish
a
single
point
of
faith
to
be
the
pope
of
rome
nor
would
a
strict
unitarian
acknowledge
the
mystery
of
the
holy
trinity
to
have
painted
raphael
of
the
in
the
range
of
excellence
we
are
distracted
by
variety
and
repelled
by
differences
the
imagination
is
fickle
and
fastidious
and
requires
a
combination
of
all
possible
qualifications
which
never
met
habit
alone
is
blind
and
tenacious
of
the
most
homely
advantages
and
after
running
the
tempting
round
of
nature
fame
and
fortune
we
wrap
ourselves
up
in
our
familiar
recollections
and
humble
pretensions
as
the
lark
after
long
fluttering
on
sunny
wing
sinks
into
its
lowly
bed
we
can
have
no
very
importunate
craving
nor
very
great
confidence
in
wishing
to
change
characters
except
with
those
with
whom
we
are
intimately
acquainted
by
their
works
and
having
these
by
us
which
is
all
we
know
or
covet
in
them
what
would
we
have
more
we
can
have
more
of
a
cat
than
her
nor
of
an
author
than
his
brains
by
becoming
shakspeare
in
reality
we
cut
ourselves
out
of
reading
milton
pope
dryden
and
a
thousand
more
all
of
whom
we
have
in
our
possession
enjoy
and
by
turns
in
the
best
part
of
them
their
thoughts
without
any
metamorphosis
or
miracle
at
all
what
a
microcosm
is
ours
what
a
proteus
is
the
human
mind
all
that
we
know
think
of
or
can
admire
in
a
manner
becomes
ourselves
we
are
not
the
meanest
of
us
a
volume
but
a
whole
library
in
this
calculation
of
problematical
contingencies
the
lapse
of
time
makes
no
difference
one
would
as
soon
have
been
raphael
as
any
modern
artist
twenty
thirty
or
forty
years
of
elegant
enjoyment
and
lofty
feeling
were
as
great
a
luxury
in
the
fifteenth
as
in
the
nineteenth
century
but
raphael
did
not
live
to
see
claude
nor
titian
rembrandt
those
who
found
arts
and
sciences
are
not
witnesses
of
their
accumulated
results
and
benefits
nor
in
general
do
they
reap
the
meed
of
praise
which
is
their
due
we
who
come
after
in
some
age
have
more
enjoyment
of
their
fame
than
they
had
who
would
have
missed
the
sight
of
the
louvre
in
all
its
glory
to
have
been
one
of
those
whose
works
enriched
it
would
it
not
have
been
giving
a
certain
good
for
an
uncertain
advantage
no
i
am
as
sure
if
it
is
not
presumption
to
say
so
of
what
passed
through
raphael
mind
as
of
what
passes
through
my
own
and
i
know
the
difference
between
seeing
though
even
that
is
a
rare
privilege
and
producing
such
perfection
at
one
time
i
was
so
devoted
to
rembrandt
that
i
think
if
the
prince
of
darkness
had
made
me
the
offer
in
some
rash
mood
i
should
have
been
tempted
to
close
with
it
and
should
have
become
in
happy
hour
and
in
downright
earnest
the
great
master
of
light
and
shade
i
have
run
myself
out
of
my
materials
for
this
essay
and
want
a
sentence
or
two
to
conclude
with
like
benvenuto
cellini
who
complains
that
with
all
the
brass
tin
iron
and
lead
he
could
muster
in
the
house
his
statue
of
perseus
was
left
imperfect
with
a
dent
in
the
heel
of
it
once
more
then
i
believe
there
is
one
character
that
all
the
world
would
like
to
change
with
which
is
that
of
a
favoured
rival
even
hatred
gives
way
to
envy
we
would
be
anything
a
toad
in
a
dungeon
to
live
upon
her
smile
which
is
our
all
of
earthly
hope
and
happiness
nor
can
we
in
our
infatuation
conceive
that
there
is
any
difference
of
feeling
on
the
subject
or
that
the
pressure
of
her
hand
is
not
in
itself
divine
making
those
to
whom
such
bliss
is
deigned
like
the
immortal
gods
footnote
when
lord
byron
was
cut
by

on
account
of
his
quarrel
with
his
wife
he
stood
leaning
on
a
marble
slab
at
the
entrance
of
a
room
while
troops
of
duchesses
and
countesses
passed
out
one
little
pert

staid
a
few
paces
behind
the

as

of
a
mingled
yarn
codrus
urceus
a
most
learned
and
unfortunate
italian
born
was
a
striking
instance
says
his
biographer
the
miseries
men
bring
upon
themselves
by
setting
their
affections
unreasonably
on
trifles
this
learned
man
lived
at
forli
and
had
an
apartment
in
the
palace
his
room
was
so
very
dark
that
he
was
forced
to
use
a
candle
in
the
day
time
and
one
day
going
abroad
without
putting
it
out
his
library
was
set
on
fire
and
some
papers
which
he
had
prepared
for
the
press
were
burned
the
instant
he
was
informed
of
this
ill
news
he
was
affected
even
to
madness
he
ran
furiously
to
the
palace
and
stopping
at
the
door
of
his
apartment
he
cried
aloud
christ
jesus
what
mighty
crime
have
i
committed
whom
of
your
followers
have
i
ever
injured
that
you
thus
rage
with
inexpiable
hatred
against
me
then
turning
himself
to
an
image
of
the
virgin
mary
near
at
hand
virgin
says
he
hear
what
i
have
to
say
for
i
speak
in
earnest
and
with
a
composed
spirit
if
i
shall
happen
to
address
you
in
my
dying
moments
i
humbly
entreat
you
not
to
hear
me
nor
receive
me
into
heaven
for
i
am
determined
to
spend
all
eternity
in
hell
those
who
heard
these
blasphemous
expressions
endeavoured
to
comfort
him
but
all
to
no
purpose
for
the
society
of
mankind
being
no
longer
supportable
to
him
he
left
the
city
and
retired
like
a
savage
to
the
deep
solitude
of
a
wood
some
say
that
he
was
murdered
there
by
ruffians
others
that
he
died
at
bologna
in
after
much
contrition
and
penitence
almost
every
one
may
here
read
the
history
of
his
own
life
there
is
scarcely
a
moment
in
which
we
are
not
in
some
degree
guilty
of
the
same
kind
of
absurdity
which
was
here
carried
to
such
a
singular
excess
we
waste
our
regrets
on
what
can
not
be
recalled
or
fix
our
desires
on
what
we
know
can
not
be
attained
every
hour
is
the
slave
of
the
last
and
we
are
seldom
masters
either
of
our
thoughts
or
of
our
actions
we
are
the
creatures
of
imagination
passion
and
more
than
of
reason
or
rousseau
in
his
proposed
to
educate
a
perfectly
reasonable
man
who
was

have
passions
and
affections
like
other
men
but
with
an
absolute
control
over
them
he
was
to
love
and
to
be
wise
this
is
a
contradiction
in
terms
even
in
the
common
transactions
and
daily
intercourse
of
life
we
are
governed
by
whim
caprice
prejudice
or
accident

us
out

a
quarrel
that
commenced
about
the
pattern
of
a
gown
may
end
only
with
our

fast
sworn
on
a
dissension

bitterest
enmity
so
fellest
foes

some
chance
some
trick
not
worth

grow
dear
friends
and
interjoin
their
issues
we
are
little
better
than
humoured
children
to
the
last
and
play
a
mischievous
game
at
cross
purposes
with
our
own
happiness
and
that
of
others
we
have
given
the
above
story
as
a
striking
contradiction
to
the
prevailing
doctrine
of
modern
systems
of
morals
and
metaphysics
that
man
is
purely
a
sensual
and
selfish
animal
governed
solely
by
a
regard
either
to
his
immediate
gratification
or
future
interest
this
doctrine
we
mean
to
oppose
with
all
our
might
whenever
we
meet
with
it
we
are
however
less
disposed
to
quarrel
with
it
as
it
is
opposed
to
reason
and
philosophy
than
as
it
interferes
with
common
sense
and
observation
if
the
absurdity
in
question
had
been
confined
to
the
schools
we
should
not
have
gone
out
of
our
way
to
meddle
with
it
but
it
has
gone
abroad
in
the
world
has
crept
into
boudoirs
is
entered
in
the
commonplace
book
of
beaux
is
in
the
mouth
of
the
learned
and
ignorant
and
forms
a
part
of
popular
opinion
it
is
perpetually
applied
as
a
false
measure
to
the
characters
and
conduct
of
men
in
the
common
affairs
of
the
world
and
it
is
therefore
our
business
to
rectify
it
if
we
can
in
fact
whoever
sets
out
on
the
idea
of
reducing
all
our
motives
and
actions
to
a
simple
principle
must
either
take
a
very
narrow
and
superficial
view
of
human
nature
or
make
a
very
perverse
use
of
his
understanding
in
reasoning
on
what
he
sees
the
frame
of
our
minds
like
that
of
his
body
is
exceedingly
complicated
besides
mere
sensibility
to
pleasure
and
pain
there
are
other
original
independent
principles
necessarily
interwoven
with
the
nature
of
man
as
an
active
and
intelligent
being
and
which
blended
together
in
different
proportions
give
their
form
and
colour
to
our
lives
without
some
other
essential
faculties
such
as
will
imagination
to
give
effect
and
direction
to
our
physical
sensibility
this
faculty
could
be
of
no
possible
use
or
influence
and
with
those
other
faculties
joined
to
it
this
pretended
instinct
of
will
be
subject
to
be
everlastingly
modified
and
controlled
by
those
faculties
both
in
what
regards
our
own
good
and
that
of
others
that
is
must
itself
become
in
a
great
measure
dependent
on
the
very
instruments
it
uses
the
two
most
predominant
principles
in
the
mind
besides
sensibility
and
are
imagination
and
or
in
general
the
love
of
strong
excitement
both
in
thought
and
action
to
these
sources
may
be
traced
the
various
passions
pursuits
habits
affections
follies
and
caprices
virtues
and
vices
of
mankind
we
shall
confine
ourselves
in
the
present
article
to
give
some
account
of
the
influence
exercised
by
the
imagination
over
the
feelings
to
an
intellectual
being
it
can
not
be
altogether
arbitrary
what
ideas
it
shall
have
whether
pleasurable
or
painful
our
ideas
do
not
originate
in
our
love
of
pleasure
and
they
can
not
therefore
depend
absolutely
upon
it
they
have
another
principle
if
the
imagination
were
servile
slave
of
our
if
our
ideas
were
emanations
of
our
sensitive
nature
encouraged
if
agreeable
and
excluded
the
instant
they
became
otherwise
or
encroached
on
the
former
principle
then
there
might
be
a
tolerable
pretence
for
the
epicurean
philosophy
which
is
here
spoken
of
but
for
any
such
entire
and
mechanical
subserviency
of
the
operations
of
the
one
principle
to
the
dictates
of
the
other
there
is
not
the
slightest
foundation
in
reality
the
attention
which
the
mind
gives
to
its
ideas
is
not
always
owing
to
the
gratification
derived
from
them
but
to
the
strength
and
truth
of
the
impressions
themselves
to
their
involuntary
power
over
the
mind
this
observation
will
account
for
a
very
general
principle
in
the
mind
which
can
not
we
conceive
be
satisfactorily
explained
in
any
other
way
we
mean
power
of
every
one
has
heard
the
story
of
the
girl
who
being
left
alone
by
her
companions
in
order
to
frighten
her
in
a
room
with
a
dead
body
at
first
attempted
to
get
out
and
shrieked
violently
for
assistance
but
finding
herself
shut
in
ran
and
embraced
the
corpse
and
was
found
senseless
in
its
arms
it
is
said
that
in
such
cases
there
is
a
desperate
effort
made
to
get
rid
of
the
dread
by
converting
it
into
the
reality
there
may
be
some
truth
in
this
account
but
we
do
not
think
it
contains
the
whole
truth
the
event
produced
in
the
present
instance
does
not
bear
out
the
conclusion
the
progress
of
the
passion
does
not
seem
to
have
been
that
of
diminishing
or
removing
the
terror
by
coming
in
contact
with
the
object
but
of
carrying
this
terror
to
its
height
from
an
intense
and
irresistible
impulse
overcoming
every
other
feeling
it
is
a
fact
that
few
persons
can
stand
safely
on
the
edge
of
a
precipice
or
walk
along
the
parapet
wall
of
a
house
without
being
in
danger
of
throwing
themselves
down
not
we
presume
from
a
principle
of
but
in
consequence
of
a
strong
idea
having
taken
possession
of
the
mind
from
which
it
can
not
well
escape
which
absorbs
every
other
consideration
and
confounds
and
overrules
all
the
impulse
can
not
in
this
case
be
resolved
into
a
desire
to
remove
the
uneasiness
of
fear
for
the
only
danger
arises
from
the
fear
we
have
been
told
by
a
person
not
at
all
given
to
exaggeration
that
he
once
felt
a
strong
propensity
to
throw
himself
into
a
cauldron
of
boiling
lead
into
which
he
was
looking
these
are
what
shakspeare
calls
toys
of
desperation
people
sometimes
marry
and
even
fall
in
love
on
this
principle
that
is
through
mere
apprehension
or
what
is
called
a
fatality
in
like
manner
we
find
instances
of
persons
who
are
as
it
were
naturally
delighted
with
whatever
is
disagreeable
who
catch
all
sorts
of
unbecoming
tones
and
gestures
who
always
say
what
they
should
not
and
what
they
do
not
mean
to
say
in
whom
intemperance
of
imagination
and
incontinence
of
tongue
are
a
disease
and
who
are
governed
by
an
almost
infallible
instinct
of
absurdity
the
love
of
imitation
has
the
same
general
source
we
dispute
for
ever
about
hogarth
and
the
question
can
never
be
decided
according
to
the
common
ideas
on
the
subject
of
taste
his
pictures
appeal
to
the
love
of
truth
not
to
the
sense
of
beauty
but
the
one
is
as
much
an
essential
principle
of
our
nature
as
the
other
they
fill
up
the
void
of
the
mind
they
present
an
everlasting
succession
and
variety
of
ideas
there
is
a
fine
observation
somewhere
made
by
aristotle
that
the
mind
has
a
natural
appetite
of
curiosity
or
desire
to
know
and
most
of
that
knowledge
which
comes
in
by
the
eye
for
this
presents
us
with
the
greatest
variety
of
differences
hogarth
is
relished
only
by
persons
of
a
certain
strength
of
mind
and
penetration
into
character
for
the
subjects
in
themselves
are
not
pleasing
and
this
objection
is
only
redeemed
by
the
exercise
and
activity
which
they
give
to
the
understanding
the
great
difference
between
what
is
meant
by
a
severe
and
an
effeminate
taste
or
style
depends
on
the
distinction
here
made
our
teasing
ourselves
to
recollect
the
names
of
places
or
persons
we
have
forgotten
the
love
of
riddles
and
of
abstruse
philosophy
are
all
illustrations
of
the
same
general
principle
of
curiosity
or
the
love
of
intellectual
excitement
again
our
impatience
to
be
delivered
of
a
secret
that
we
know
the
necessity
which
lovers
have
for
confidants
auricular
confession
and
the
declarations
so
commonly
made
by
criminals
of
their
guilt
are
effects
of
the
involuntary
power
exerted
by
the
imagination
over
the
feelings
nothing
can
be
more
untrue
than
that
the
whole
course
of
our
ideas
passions
and
pursuits
is
regulated
by
a
regard
to
our
attachment
to
certain
objects
is
much
oftener
in
proportion
to
the
strength
of
the
impression
they
make
on
us
to
their
power
of
riveting
and
fixing
the
attention
than
to
the
gratification
we
derive
from
them
we
are
perhaps
more
apt
to
dwell
upon
circumstances
that
excite
disgust
and
shock
our
feelings
than
on
those
of
an
agreeable
nature
this
at
least
is
the
case
where
this
disposition
is
particularly
strong
as
in
people
of
nervous
feelings
and
morbid
habits
of
thinking
thus
the
mind
is
often
haunted
with
painful
images
and
recollections
from
the
hold
they
have
taken
of
the
imagination
we
can
not
shake
them
off
though
we
strive
to
do
it
nay
we
even
court
their
company
we
will
not
part
with
them
out
of
our
presence
we
strain
our
aching
sight
after
them
we
anxiously
recall
every
feature
and
contemplate
them
in
all
their
aggravated
colours
there
are
a
thousand
passions
and
fancies
that
thwart
our
purposes
and
disturb
our
repose
grief
and
fear
are
almost
as
welcome
inmates
of
the
breast
as
hope
or
joy
and
more
obstinately
cherished
we
return
to
the
objects
which
have
excited
them
we
brood
over
them
they
become
almost
inseparable
from
the
mind
necessary
to
it
they
assimilate
all
objects
to
the
gloom
of
our
own
thoughts
and
make
the
will
a
party
against
itself
this
is
one
chief
source
of
most
of
the
passions
that
prey
like
vultures
on
the
heart
and
embitter
human
life
we
hear
moralists
and
divines
perpetually
exclaiming
with
mingled
indignation
and
surprise
at
the
folly
of
mankind
in
obstinately
persisting
in
these
tormenting
and
violent
passions
such
as
envy
revenge
sullenness
despair
etc
this
is
to
them
a
mystery
and
it
will
always
remain
an
inexplicable
one
while
the
love
of
happiness
is
considered
as
the
only
spring
of
human
conduct
and
desires
the
love
of
power
or
action
is
another
independent
principle
of
the
human
mind
in
the
different
degrees
in
which
it
exists
and
which
are
not
by
any
means
in
exact
proportion
to
its
physical
sensibility
it
seems
evidently
absurd
to
suppose
that
sensibility
to
pleasure
or
pain
is
the
only
principle
of
action
it
is
almost
too
obvious
to
remark
that
sensibility
alone
without
an
active
principle
in
the
mind
could
never
produce
action
the
soul
might
lie
dissolved
in
pleasure
or
be
agonised
with
woe
but
the
impulses
of
feeling
in
order
to
excite
passion
desire
or
will
must
be
first
communicated
to
some
other
faculty
there
must
be
a
principle
a
fund
of
activity
somewhere
by
and
through
which
our
sensibility
operates
and
that
this
active
principle
owes
all
its
force
its
precise
degree
of
direction
to
the
sensitive
faculty
is
neither
nor
true
strength
of
will
is
not
always
nor
generally
in
proportion
to
strength
of
feeling
there
are
different
degrees
of
activity
as
of
sensibility
in
the
mind
and
our
passions
characters
and
pursuits
often
depend
no
less
upon
the
one
than
on
the
other
we
continually
make
a
distinction
in
common
discourse
between
sensibility
and
irritability
between
passion
and
feeling
between
the
nerves
and
muscles
and
we
find
that
the
most
voluptuous
people
are
in
general
the
most
indolent
every
one
who
has
looked
closely
into
human
nature
must
have
observed
persons
who
are
naturally
and
habitually
restless
in
the
extreme
but
without
any
extraordinary
susceptibility
to
pleasure
or
pain
always
making
or
finding
excuses
to
do
something
whose
actions
constantly
outrun
the
occasion
and
who
are
eager
in
the
pursuit
of
the
greatest
trifles
whose
impatience
of
the
smallest
repose
keeps
them
always
employed
about
nothing
and
whose
whole
lives
are
a
continued
work
of
supererogation
there
are
others
again
who
seem
born
to
act
from
a
spirit
of
contradiction
only
that
is
who
are
ready
to
act
not
only
without
a
reason
but
against
it
who
are
ever
at
with
themselves
and
others
who
are
not
satisfied
unless
they
are
doing
two
opposite
things
at
a
time
who
contradict
what
you
say
and
if
you
assent
to
them
contradict
what
they
have
said
who
regularly
leave
the
pursuit
in
which
they
are
successful
to
engage
in
some
other
in
which
they
have
no
chance
of
success
who
make
a
point
of
encountering
difficulties
and
aiming
at
impossibilities
that
there
may
be
no
end
of
their
exhaustless
task
while
there
is
a
third
class
whose
scarcely
any
motives
can
overcome
who
are
devoured
by
their
feelings
and
the
slaves
of
their
passions
but
who
can
take
no
pains
and
use
no
means
to
gratify
them
who
if
roused
to
action
by
any
unforeseen
accident
require
a
continued
stimulus
to
urge
them
on
who
fluctuate
between
desire
and
want
of
resolution
whose
brightest
projects
burst
like
a
bubble
as
soon
as
formed
who
yield
to
every
obstacle
who
almost
sink
under
the
weight
of
the
atmosphere
who
can
not
brush
aside
a
cobweb
in
their
path
and
are
stopped
by
an
insect
wing
indolence
is
want
of
will
the
absence
or
defect
of
the
active
principle
a
repugnance
to
motion
and
whoever
has
been
much
tormented
with
this
passion
must
we
are
sure
have
felt
that
the
inclination
to
indulge
it
is
something
very
distinct
from
the
love
of
pleasure
or
actual
enjoyment
ambition
is
the
reverse
of
indolence
and
is
the
love
of
power
or
action
in
great
things
avarice
also
as
it
relates
to
the
acquisition
of
riches
is
in
a
great
measure
an
active
and
enterprising
feeling
nor
does
the
hoarding
of
wealth
after
it
is
acquired
seem
to
have
much
connection
with
the
love
of
pleasure
what
is
called
niggardliness
very
often
we
are
convinced
from
particular
instances
that
we
have
known
arises
less
from
a
selfish
principle
than
from
a
love
of
contrivance
from
the
study
of
economy
as
an
art
for
want
of
a
better
from
a
pride
in
making
the
most
of
a
little
and
in
not
exceeding
a
certain
expense
previously
determined
upon
all
which
is
wilfulness
and
is
perfectly
consistent
as
it
is
frequently
found
united
with
the
utmost
lavish
expenditure
and
the
utmost
disregard
for
money
on
other
occasions
a
miser
may
in
general
be
looked
upon
as
a
particular
species
of
the
constant
desire
in
the
rich
to
leave
wealth
in
large
masses
by
aggrandising
some
branch
of
their
families
or
sometimes
in
such
a
manner
as
to
accumulate
for
centuries
shows
that
the
imagination
has
a
considerable
share
in
this
passion
intemperance
debauchery
gluttony
and
other
vices
of
that
kind
may
be
attributed
to
an
excess
of
sensuality
or
gross
sensibility
though
even
here
we
think
it
evident
that
habits
of
intoxication
are
produced
quite
as
much
by
the
strength
as
by
the
agreeableness
of
the
excitement
and
with
respect
to
some
other
vicious
habits
curiosity
makes
many
more
votaries
than
inclination
the
love
of
truth
when
it
predominates
produces
inquisitive
characters
the
whole
tribe
of
gossips
harmless
busybodies
your
blunt
honest
creatures
who
never
conceal
what
they
think
and
who
are
the
more
sure
to
tell
it
you
the
less
you
want
to
hear
it
and
now
and
then
a
philosopher
our
passions
in
general
are
to
be
traced
more
immediately
to
the
active
part
of
our
nature
to
the
love
of
power
or
to
strength
of
will
such
are
all
those
which
arise
out
of
the
difficulty
of
accomplishment
which
become
more
intense
from
the
efforts
made
to
attain
the
object
and
which
derive
their
strength
from
opposition
hobbes
says
well
on
this
subject
for
an
utmost
end
in
which
the
ancient
philosophers
placed
felicity
and
disputed
much
concerning
the
way
thereto
there
is
no
such
thing
in
this
world
nor
way
to
it
more
than
to
utopia
for
while
we
live
we
have
desires
and
desire
presupposeth
a
further
end
seeing
all
delight
is
appetite
and
desire
of
something
further
there
can
be
no
contentment
but
in
proceeding
and
therefore
we
are
not
to
marvel
when
we
see
that
as
men
attain
to
more
riches
honour
or
other
power
so
their
appetite
continually
groweth
more
and
more
and
when
they
are
come
to
the
utmost
degree
of
some
kind
of
power
they
pursue
some
other
as
long
as
in
any
kind
they
think
themselves
behind
any
other
of
those
therefore
that
have
attained
the
highest
degree
of
honour
and
riches
some
have
affected
mastery
in
some
art
as
nero
in
music
and
poetry
commodus
in
the
art
of
a
gladiator
and
such
as
affect
not
some
such
thing
must
find
diversion
and
recreation
of
their
thoughts
in
the
contention
either
of
play
or
business
and
men
justly
complain
as
of
a
great
grief
that
they
know
not
what
to
do
felicity
therefore
by
which
we
mean
continual
delight
consists
not
in
having
prospered
but
in
prospering
this
account
of
human
nature
true
as
it
is
would
be
a
mere
romance
if
physical
sensibility
were
the
only
faculty
essential
to
man
that
is
if
we
were
the
slaves
of
voluptuous
indolence
but
our
desires
are
kindled
by
their
own
heat
the
will
is
urged
on
by
a
restless
impulse
and
without
action
enjoyment
becomes
insipid
the
passions
of
men
are
not
in
proportion
only
to
their
sensibility
or
to
the
desirableness
of
the
object
but
to
the
violence
and
irritability
of
their
tempers
and
the
obstacles
to
their
success
thus
an
object
to
which
we
were
almost
indifferent
while
we
thought
it
in
our
power
often
excites
the
most
ardent
pursuit
or
the
most
painful
regret
as
soon
as
it
is
placed
out
of
our
reach
how
eloquently
is
the
contradiction
between
our
desires
and
our
success
described
in
where
it
is
said
of
the
lover
that
courted
a
statue
hunted
the
wind
cried
aloud
to
the
desert
the
necessity
of
action
to
the
mind
and
the
keen
edge
it
gives
to
our
desires
is
shown
in
the
different
value
we
set
on
past
and
future
objects
it
is
commonly
and
we
might
almost
say
universally
supposed
that
there
is
an
essential
difference
in
the
two
cases
in
this
instance
however
the
strength
of
our
passions
has
converted
an
evident
absurdity
into
one
of
the
most
inveterate
prejudices
of
the
human
mind
that
the
future
is
really
or
in
itself
of
more
consequence
than
the
past
is
what
we
can
neither
assent
to
nor
even
conceive
it
is
true
the
past
has
ceased
to
be
and
is
no
longer
anything
except
to
the
mind
but
the
future
is
still
to
come
and
has
an
existence
in
the
mind
only
the
one
is
at
an
end
the
other
has
not
even
had
a
beginning
both
are
purely
ideal
so
that
this
argument
would
prove
that
the
present
only
is
of
any
real
value
and
that
both
past
and
future
objects
are
equally
indifferent
alike
nothing
indeed
the
future
is
if
possible
more
imaginary
than
the
past
for
the
past
may
in
some
sense
be
said
to
exist
in
its
consequences
it
acts
still
it
is
present
to
us
in
its
effects
the
mouldering
ruins
and
broken
fragments
still
remain
but
of
the
future
there
is
no
trace
what
a
blank
does
the
history
of
the
world
for
the
next
six
thousand
years
present
to
the
mind
compared
with
that
of
the
last
all
that
strikes
the
imagination
or
excites
any
interest
in
the
mighty
scene
is
has
neither
in
reality
then
nor
as
a
subject
of
general
contemplation
has
the
future
any
advantage
over
the
past
but
with
respect
to
our
own
passions
and
pursuits
it
has
we
regret
the
pleasures
we
have
enjoyed
and
eagerly
anticipate
those
which
are
to
come
we
dwell
with
satisfaction
on
the
evils
from
which
we
have
escaped
and
dread
future
pain
the
good
that
is
past
is
like
money
that
is
spent
which
is
of
no
use
and
about
which
we
give
no
further
concern
the
good
we
expect
is
like
a
store
yet
untouched
in
the
enjoyment
of
which
we
promise
ourselves
infinite
gratification
what
has
happened
to
us
we
think
of
no
consequence
what
is
to
happen
to
us
of
the
greatest
why
so
because
the
one
is
in
our
power
and
the
other
not
because
the
efforts
of
the
will
to
bring
an
object
to
pass
or
to
avert
it
strengthen
our
attachment
to
or
our
aversion
from
that
object
because
the
habitual
pursuit
of
any
purpose
redoubles
the
ardour
of
our
pursuit
and
converts
the
speculative
and
indolent
interest
we
should
otherwise
take
in
it
into
real
passion
our
regrets
anxiety
and
wishes
are
thrown
away
upon
the
past
but
we
encourage
our
disposition
to
exaggerate
the
importance
of
the
future
as
of
the
utmost
use
in
aiding
our
resolutions
and
stimulating
our
exertions
it
in
some
measure
confirms
this
theory
that
men
attach
more
or
less
importance
to
past
and
future
events
according
as
they
are
more
or
else
engaged
in
action
and
the
busy
scenes
of
life
those
who
have
a
fortune
to
make
or
are
in
pursuit
of
rank
and
power
are
regardless
of
the
past
for
it
does
not
contribute
to
their
views
those
who
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
think
take
nearly
the
same
interest
in
the
past
as
in
the
future
the
contemplation
of
the
one
is
as
delightful
and
real
as
of
the
other
the
season
of
hope
comes
to
an
end
but
the
remembrance
of
it
is
left
the
past
still
lives
in
the
memory
of
those
who
have
leisure
to
look
back
upon
the
way
that
they
have
trod
and
can
from
it
glimpses
that
may
make
them
less
forlorn
the
turbulence
of
action
and
uneasiness
of
desire
dwell
upon
the
future
it
is
only
amidst
the
innocence
of
shepherds
in
the
simplicity
of
the
pastoral
ages
that
a
tomb
was
found
with
this
inscription
also
was
an
arcadian
we
feel
that
some
apology
is
necessary
for
having
thus
plunged
our
readers
all
at
once
into
the
middle
of
metaphysics
if
it
should
be
asked
what
use
such
studies
are
of
we
might
answer
with
hume
of
none
except
that
there
are
certain
persons
who
find
more
entertainment
in
them
than
in
any
an
account
of
this
matter
with
which
we
were
amused
ourselves
and
which
may
therefore
amuse
others
we
met
with
some
time
ago
in
a
metaphysical
allegory
which
begins
in
this
manner
the
depth
of
a
forest
in
the
kingdom
of
indostan
lived
a
monkey
who
before
his
last
step
of
transmigration
had
occupied
a
human
tenement
he
had
been
a
bramin
skilful
in
theology
and
in
all
abstruse
learning
he
was
wont
to
hold
in
admiration
the
ways
of
nature
and
delighted
to
penetrate
the
mysteries
in
which
she
was
enrobed
but
in
pursuing
the
footsteps
of
philosophy
he
wandered
too
far
from
the
abode
of
the
social
virtues
in
order
to
pursue
his
studies
he
had
retired
to
a
cave
on
the
banks
of
the
jumna
there
he
forgot
society
and
neglected
ablution
and
therefore
his
soul
was
degraded
to
a
condition
below
humanity
so
inveterate
were
the
habits
which
he
had
contracted
in
his
human
state
that
his
spirit
was
still
influenced
by
his
passion
for
abstruse
study
he
sojourned
in
this
wood
from
youth
to
age
regardless
of
everything
and
for
our
own
part
we
should
be
content
to
pass
our
time
much
in
the
same
manner
as
this
learned
savage
if
we
could
only
find
a
substitute
for
his
we
do
not
however
wish
to
recommend
the
same
pursuit
to
others
nor
to
dissuade
them
from
it
it
has
its
pleasures
and
its
pains
its
successes
and
its
disappointments
it
is
neither
quite
so
sublime
nor
quite
so
uninteresting
as
it
is
sometimes
represented
the
worst
is
that
much
thought
on
difficult
subjects
tends
after
a
certain
time
to
destroy
the
natural
gaiety
and
dancing
of
the
spirits
it
deadens
the
elastic
force
of
the
mind
weighs
upon
the
heart
and
makes
us
insensible
to
the
common
enjoyments
and
pursuits
of
life
no
fairy
lights
no
ray
nor
stir
of
pulse
nor
objects
to
entice
abroad
the
spirits
but
the
cloyster
heart
sits
squat
at
home
like
pagod
in
a
niche
obscure
metaphysical
reasoning
is
also
one
branch
of
the
tree
of
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
the
study
of
man
however
does
perhaps
less
harm
than
a
knowledge
of
the
world
though
it
must
be
owned
that
the
practical
knowledge
of
vice
and
misery
makes
a
stronger
impression
on
the
mind
when
it
has
imbibed
a
habit
of
abstract
reasoning
evil
thus
becomes
embodied
in
a
general
principle
and
shows
its
harpy
form
in
all
things
it
is
a
fatal
inevitable
necessity
hanging
over
us
it
follows
us
wherever
we
go
if
we
fly
into
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
earth
it
is
there
whether
we
turn
to
the
right
or
the
left
we
can
not
escape
from
it
this
it
is
true
is
the
disease
of
philosophy
but
it
is
one
to
which
it
is
liable
in
minds
of
a
certain
cast
after
the
first
ardour
of
expectation
has
been
disabused
by
experience
and
the
finer
feelings
have
received
an
irrecoverable
shock
from
the
jarring
of
the
world
happy
are
they
who
live
in
the
dream
of
their
own
existence
and
see
all
things
in
the
light
of
their
own
minds
who
walk
by
faith
and
hope
to
whom
the
guiding
star
of
their
youth
still
shines
from
afar
and
into
whom
the
spirit
of
the
world
has
not
entered
they
have
not
been
by
the
archers
nor
has
the
iron
entered
their
souls
they
live
in
the
midst
of
arrows
and
of
death
unconscious
of
harm
the
evil
things
come
not
nigh
them
the
shafts
of
ridicule
pass
unheeded
by
and
malice
loses
its
sting
the
example
of
vice
does
not
rankle
in
their
breasts
like
the
poisoned
shirt
of
nessus
evil
impressions
fall
off
from
them
like
drops
of

the
yoke
of

is
to
them
light
and

the
world
has
no
hold
on
them
they
are
in
it
not

a

footnote
as
a
contrast
to
the
story
at
the
beginning
of
this
article
it
will
be
not
amiss
to
mention
that
of
sir
isaac
newton
on
a
somewhat
similar
occasion
he
had
prepared
some
papers
for
the
press
with
great
care
and
study
but
happening
to
leave
a
lighted
candle
on
the
table
with
them
his
dog
diamond
overturned
the
candle
and
the
labour
of
several
years
was
destroyed
this
great
man
on
seeing
what
was
done
only
shook
his
head
and
said
with
a
smile
diamond
you
know
what
mischief
you
have
done
essay
viii
on
means
and
ends
it
is
impossible
to
have
things
done
without
doing
them
this
seems
a
truism
and
yet
what
is
more
common
than
to
suppose
that
we
shall
find
things
done
merely
by
wishing
it
to
put
the
will
for
the
deed
is
as
usual
in
practice
as
it
is
contrary
to
common
sense
there
is
in
fact
no
absurdity
no
contradiction
of
which
the
will
is
not
capable
this
is
i
think
more
remarkable
in
the
english
than
in
any
other
people
in
whom
to
judge
by
what
i
discover
in
myself
the
will
bears
great
and
disproportioned
sway
we
will
a
thing
we
contemplate
the
end
intensely
and
think
it
done
neglecting
the
necessary
means
to
accomplish
it
the
strong
tendency
of
the
mind
towards
it
the
internal
effort
it
makes
to
give
being
to
the
object
of
its
idolatry
seems
an
adequate
cause
to
produce
the
effect
and
in
a
manner
identified
with
it
this
is
more
particularly
the
case
in
what
relates
to
the
and
will
account
for
some
phenomena
of
the
national
character
the
english
school
is
distinguished
by
what
are
called
rude
violent
attempts
at
effect
and
a
total
inattention
to
the
details
or
delicacy
of
finishing
now
this
i
think
proceeds
not
exactly
from
grossness
of
perception
but
from
the
wilfulness
of
our
character
our
desire
to
have
things
our
own
way
without
any
trouble
or
distraction
of
purpose
an
object
strikes
us
we
see
and
feel
the
whole
effect
we
wish
to
produce
a
likeness
of
it
but
we
want
to
transfer
this
impression
to
the
canvas
as
it
is
conveyed
to
us
simultaneously
and
intuitively
that
is
to
stamp
it
there
at
a
blow
or
otherwise
we
turn
away
with
impatience
and
disgust
as
if
the
means
were
an
obstacle
to
the
end
and
every
attention
to
the
mechanical
part
of
art
were
a
deviation
from
our
original
purpose
we
thus
degenerate
after
repeated
failures
into
a
slovenly
style
of
art
and
that
which
was
at
first
an
undisciplined
and
irregular
impulse
becomes
a
habit
and
then
a
theory
it
seems
strange
that
the
love
of
the
end
should
produce
aversion
to
the
means
but
so
it
is
neither
is
it
altogether
unnatural
that
which
we
are
struck
with
which
we
are
enamoured
of
is
the
general
appearance
and
result
and
it
would
certainly
be
most
desirable
to
produce
the
effect
in
the
same
manner
by
a
mere
word
or
wish
if
it
were
possible
without
entering
into
any
mechanical
drudgery
or
minuteness
of
detail
or
dexterity
of
execution
which
though
they
are
essential
and
component
parts
of
the
work
do
not
enter
into
our
thoughts
and
form
no
part
of
our
contemplation
we
may
find
it
necessary
on
a
cool
calculation
to
go
through
and
learn
these
but
in
so
doing
we
only
submit
to
necessity
and
they
are
still
a
diversion
to
and
a
suspension
of
our
purpose
for
the
time
at
least
unless
practice
gives
that
facility
which
almost
identifies
the
two
together
or
makes
the
process
an
unconscious
one
the
end
thus
devours
up
the
means
or
our
eagerness
for
the
one
where
it
is
strong
and
unchecked
is
in
proportion
to
our
impatience
of
the
other
we
view
an
object
at
a
distance
that
excites
an
inclination
to
visit
it
which
we
do
after
many
tedious
steps
and
intricate
ways
but
if
we
could
fly
we
should
never
walk
the
mind
however
has
wings
though
the
body
has
not
and
it
is
this
that
produces
the
contradiction
in
question
the
first
and
strongest
impulse
of
the
mind
is
to
produce
any
work
at
once
and
by
the
most
energetic
means
but
as
this
can
not
always
be
done
we
should
not
neglect
other
more
mechanical
ones
but
that
delusions
of
passion
overrule
the
convictions
of
the
understanding
and
what
we
strongly
wish
we
fancy
to
be
possible
and
true
we
are
full
of
the
effect
we
intend
to
produce
and
imagine
we
have
produced
it
in
spite
of
the
evidence
of
our
senses
and
the
suggestions
of
our
friends
in
fact
after
a
number
of
fruitless
efforts
and
violent
throes
to
produce
an
effect
which
we
passionately
long
for
it
seems
all
injustice
not
to
have
produced
it
if
we
have
not
commanded
success
we
have
done
more
we
have
deserved
it
we
have
copied
nature
or
titian
in
the
spirit
in
which
they
ought
to
be
copied
and
we
see
them
before
us
in
our
eye
there
is
the
look
the
expression
the
something
or
other
which
we
chiefly
aim
at
and
thus
we
persist
and
make
fifty
excuses
to
deceive
ourselves
and
confirm
our
errors
or
if
the
light
breaks
upon
us
through
all
the
disguises
of
sophistry
and
it
is
so
painful
that
we
shut
our
eyes
to
it
the
greater
the
mortification
the
more
violent
the
effort
to
throw
it
off
and
thus
we
stick
to
our
determination
and
end
where
we
began
what
makes
me
think
that
this
is
the
process
of
our
minds
and
not
merely
rusticity
or
want
of
apprehension
is
that
you
will
see
an
english
artist
admiring
and
thrown
into
raptures
by
the
tucker
of
titian
mistress
made
up
of
an
infinite
number
of
little
folds
but
if
he
attempts
to
copy
it
he
proceeds
to
omit
all
these
details
and
dash
it
off
by
a
single
smear
of
his
brush
this
is
not
ignorance
or
even
laziness
but
what
is
called
jumping
at
a
conclusion
it
is
in
a
word
all
overweening
purpose
he
sees
the
details
the
varieties
and
their
effects
and
he
admires
them
but
he
sees
them
with
a
glance
of
his
eye
and
as
a
wilful
man
must
have
his
way
he
would
reproduce
them
by
a
single
dash
of
the
pencil
the
mixing
his
colours
the
putting
in
and
out
the
giving
his
attention
to
a
minute
break
or
softening
in
the
particular
lights
and
shades
is
a
mechanical
and
everlasting
operation
very
different
from
the
delight
he
feels
in
contemplating
the
effect
of
all
this
when
properly
and
finely
done
such
details
are
foreign
to
his
refined
taste
and
some
doubts
arise
in
his
mind
in
the
midst
of
his
gratitude
and
his
raptures
as
to
how
titian
could
resolve
upon
the
drudgery
of
going
through
them
and
whether
it
was
not
done
by
extreme
facility
of
hand
and
a
sort
of
trick
abridging
the
mechanical
labour
no
one
wrote
or
talked
more
enthusiastically
about
harmony
of
colouring
than
the
late
barry
yet
his
own
colouring
was
dead
and
dry
and
if
he
had
copied
a
titian
he
would
have
made
it
a
mere
splash
leaving
out
all
that
caused
his
wonder
or
admiration
after
his
english
or
rather
irish
fashion
we
not
only
grudge
the
labour
of
beginning
but
we
give
up
for
the
same
reason
when
we
are
near
touching
the
goal
of
success
and
to
save
a
few
last
touches
leave
a
work
unfinished
and
an
object
unattained
the
immediate
process
the
daily
gradual
improvement
the
completion
of
parts
giving
us
no
pleasure
we
strain
at
the
whole
result
we
wish
to
have
it
done
and
in
our
anxiety
to
have
it
off
our
hands
say
it
will
do
and
lose
the
benefit
of
all
our
labour
by
grudging
a
little
pains
and
not
commanding
a
little
patience
in
a
day
or
two
suppose
a
copy
of
a
fine
titian
would
be
as
complete
as
we
could
make
it
the
prospect
of
this
so
enchants
us
that
we
skip
the
intermediate
days
see
no
great
use
in
going
on
with
it
fancy
that
we
may
spoil
it
and
in
order
to
have
the
job
done
take
it
home
with
us
when
we
immediately
see
our
error
and
spend
the
rest
of
our
lives
in
repenting
that
we
did
not
finish
it
properly
at
the
time
we
see
the
whole
nature
of
a
picture
at
once
we
only
do
a
part
illæ
a
french
artist
on
the
contrary
has
none
of
this
uneasy
anxious
feeling
of
this
desire
to
grasp
the
whole
of
his
subject
and
anticipate
his
good
fortune
at
a
blow
of
this
massing
and
concentrating
principle
he
takes
the
thing
more
easily
and
rationally
suppose
he
undertakes
to
copy
a
picture
he
looks
at
it
and
copies
it
bit
by
bit
he
does
not
set
off
headlong
without
knowing
where
he
is
going
or
plunge
into
all
sorts
of
difficulties
and
absurdities
from
impatience
to
begin
and
thinking
that
sooner
said
than
done
but
takes
time
to
consider
lays
his
plans
gets
in
his
outline
and
his
distances
and
lays
a
foundation
before
he
attempts
a
superstructure
which
he
may
have
to
pull
to
pieces
again
he
looks
before
he
leaps
which
is
contrary
to
the
true
blindfold
english
principle
and
i
should
think
that
we
had
invented
this
proverb
from
seeing
so
many
fatal
examples
of
the
neglect
of
it
he
does
not
make
the
picture
all
black
or
all
white
because
one
part
of
it
is
so
and
because
he
can
not
alter
an
idea
he
has
once
got
into
his
head
and
must
always
run
into
extremes
but
varies
from
green
to
red
from
orange
tawney
to
yellow
from
grey
to
brown
according
as
they
vary
in
the
original
he
sees
no
inconsistency
or
forfeiture
of
a
principle
in
this
but
a
great
deal
of
right
reason
and
indeed
an
absolute
necessity
if
he
wishes
to
succeed
in
what
he
is
about
this
is
the
last
thing
an
englishman
thinks
of
he
only
wants
to
have
his
own
way
though
it
ends
in
defeat
and
ruin
he
sets
about
a
thing
which
he
had
little
prospect
of
accomplishing
and
if
he
finds
he
can
do
it
gives
it
over
and
leaves
the
matter
short
of
success
which
is
too
agreeable
an
idea
for
him
to
indulge
in
the
french
artist
proceeds
bit
by
bit
he
takes
one
part
a
hand
a
piece
of
drapery
a
part
of
the
background
and
finishes
it
carefully
then
another
and
so
on
to
the
end
he
does
not
from
a
childish
impatience
when
he
is
near
the
conclusion
destroy
the
effect
of
the
whole
by
leaving
some
one
part
eminently
defective
nor
fly
from
what
he
is
about
to
something
else
that
catches
his
eye
neglecting
the
one
and
spoiling
the
other
he
is
constrained
by
mastery
by
the
mastery
of
common
sense
and
pleasurable
feeling
he
is
in
no
hurry
to
finish
for
he
has
a
satisfaction
in
the
work
and
touches
and
retouches
perhaps
a
single
head
day
after
day
and
week
after
week
without
repining
uneasiness
or
apparent
progress
the
very
lightness
and
indifference
of
his
feelings
renders
him
patient
and
laborious
an
englishman
whatever
he
is
about
or
undertakes
is
as
if
he
was
carrying
a
heavy
load
that
oppresses
both
his
body
and
mind
and
which
he
is
anxious
to
throw
down
a
frenchman
hopes
or
fears
are
not
excited
to
that
pitch
of
intolerable
agony
that
compels
him
in
mere
compassion
to
himself
to
bring
the
question
to
a
speedy
issue
even
to
the
loss
of
his
object
he
is
calm
easy
and
indifferent
and
can
take
his
time
and
make
the
most
of
his
advantages
with
impunity
pleased
with
himself
he
is
pleased
with
whatever
occupies
his
attention
nearly
alike
it
is
the
same
to
him
whether
he
paints
an
angel
or
a
it
is
the
same
to
him
whether
it
is
landscape
or
history
it
is
he
who
paints
it
that
is
sufficient
nothing
puts
him
out
of
conceit
with
his
work
for
nothing
puts
him
out
of
conceit
with
himself
this
produces
admirable
patience
and
docility
in
certain
particulars
besides
charity
and
toleration
towards
others
i
remember
a
ludicrous
instance
of
this
deliberate
process
in
a
young
french
artist
who
was
copying
the
in
the
louvre
some
twenty
years
ago
after
getting
it
in
one
would
think
he
would
have
been
attracted
to
the
face
that
heaven
of
beauty
which
makes
a
sunshine
in
the
shady
place
or
to
some
part
of
the
poetry
of
the
picture
instead
of
which
he
began
to
finish
a
square
he
had
marked
out
in
the
corner
of
the
picture
he
set
to
work
like
a
cabinetmaker
or
an
engraver
and
seemed
to
have
no
sympathy
with
the
soul
of
the
picture
indeed
to
a
frenchman
there
is
no
distinction
between
the
great
and
little
the
pleasurable
and
the
painful
the
utmost
he
arrives
at
a
conception
of
is
the
indifferent
and
the
light
another
young
man
at
the
time
i
speak
of
was
for
eleven
weeks
i
think
it
was
daily
employed
in
making
a
blacklead
pencil
drawing
of
a
small
leonardo
he
sat
on
a
rail
to
do
it
kept
his
hat
on
rose
up
went
to
the
fire
to
warm
himself
talked
constantly
of
the
excellence
of
the
different
masters
titian
for
colour
raphael
for
expression
poussin
for
composition
all
being
alike
to
him
provided
there
was
a
word
to
express
it
for
all
he
thought
about
was
his
own
harangue
and
having
consulted
some
friend
on
his
progress
he
returned
to
as
he
called
it
his
copy
this
would
drive
an
englishman
mad
or
stupid
the
perseverance
and
the
indifference
the
labour
without
impulse
the
attention
to
the
parts
in
succession
and
disregard
of
the
whole
together
are
to
him
absolutely
inconceivable
a
frenchman
only
exists
in
his
present
sensations
and
provided
he
is
left
free
to
these
as
they
arise
he
cares
about
nothing
farther
looking
neither
backward
nor
forward
with
all
this
affectation
and
artifice
there
is
on
this
account
a
kind
of
simplicity
and
nature
about
them
after
all
they
lend
themselves
to
the
impression
before
them
with
good
humour
and
good
will
making
it
neither
better
nor
worse
than
it
is
the
english
overdo
or
underdo
everything
and
are
either
drunk
or
in
despair
i
do
not
speak
of
all
frenchmen
or
of
all
englishmen
but
of
the
most
characteristic
specimens
of
each
class
the
extreme
slowness
and
methodical
regularity
of
the
french
has
arisen
out
of
this
indifference
and
even
frivolity
their
natural
character
for
owing
to
it
their
laborious
minuteness
costs
them
nothing
they
have
no
strong
impulses
or
ardent
longings
that
urge
them
to
the
violation
of
rules
or
hurry
them
away
with
a
subject
and
with
the
interest
belonging
to
it
everything
is
matter
of
calculation
and
measured
beforehand
in
order
to
assist
their
fluttering
and
their
feebleness
when
they
get
beyond
the
literal
and
the
formal
and
attempt
the
impressive
and
the
grand
as
in
and
girardot
pictures
defend
us
from
sublimity
heaped
on
insipidity
and
you
see
a
frenchman
in
the
louvre
copying
the
finest
pictures
standing
on
one
leg
with
his
hat
on
or
after
copying
a
raphael
thinking
david
much
finer
more
truly
one
of
themselves
more
a
combination
of
the
greek
sculptor
and
the
french
even
if
a
french
artist
fails
he
is
not
disconcerted
there
is
something
else
he
excels
in
if
he
can
not
paint
he
can
dance
if
an
englishman
save
the
mark
fails
in
anything
he
thinks
he
can
do
nothing
enraged
at
the
mention
of
his
ability
to
do
anything
else
and
at
any
consolation
offered
to
him
he
banishes
all
other
thought
but
of
his
disappointment
and
discarding
hope
from
his
breast
neither
eats
nor
sleeps
it
is
well
if
he
does
not
cut
his
throat
will
not
attend
to
any
other
thing
in
which
he
before
took
an
interest
and
pride
and
is
in
despair
till
he
recovers
his
good
opinion
of
himself
in
the
point
in
which
he
has
been
disgraced
though
from
his
very
anxiety
and
disorder
of
mind
he
is
incapacitated
from
applying
to
the
only
means
of
doing
so
as
much
as
if
he
were
drunk
with
liquor
instead
of
with
pride
and
passion
the
character
i
have
here
drawn
of
an
englishman
i
am
clear
about
for
it
is
the
character
of
myself
and
i
am
sorry
to
add
no
exaggerated
one
as
my
object
is
to
paint
the
varieties
of
human
nature
and
as
i
can
have
it
best
from
myself
i
will
confess
a
weakness
i
lately
tried
to
copy
a
titian
after
many
years
want
of
practice
in
order
to
give
a
friend
in
england
some
idea
of
the
picture
i
floundered
on
for
several
days
but
failed
as
might
be
expected
my
sky
became
overcast
everything
seemed
of
the
colour
of
the
paint
i
used
nature
was
one
great
daub
i
had
no
feeling
left
but
a
sense
of
want
of
power
and
of
an
abortive
struggle
to
do
what
i
could
not
do
i
was
ashamed
of
being
seen
to
look
at
the
picture
with
admiration
as
if
i
had
no
right
to
do
so
i
was
ashamed
even
to
have
written
or
spoken
about
the
picture
or
about
art
at
all
it
seemed
a
piece
of
presumption
or
affectation
in
me
whose
whole
notions
and
refinements
on
the
subject
ended
in
an
inexcusable
daub
why
did
i
think
of
attempting
such
a
thing
heedlessly
of
exposing
my
presumption
and
incapacity
it
was
blotting
from
my
memory
covering
with
a
dark
veil
all
that
i
remembered
of
those
pictures
formerly
my
hopes
when
young
my
regrets
since
it
was
wresting
from
me
one
of
the
consolations
of
my
life
and
of
my
declining
years
i
was
even
afraid
to
walk
out
by
the
barrier
of
neuilly
or
to
recall
to
memory
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
picture
all
was
turned
to
bitterness
and
gall
to
feel
anything
but
a
sense
of
my
own
helplessness
and
absurdity
seemed
a
want
of
sincerity
a
mockery
and
a
piece
of
injustice
the
only
comfort
i
had
was
in
the
excess
of
pain
i
felt
this
was
at
least
some
distinction
i
was
not
insensible
on
that
side
no
frenchman
i
thought
would
regret
the
not
copying
a
titian
so
much
as
i
did
or
so
far
show
the
same
value
for
it
besides
i
had
copied
this
identical
picture
very
well
formerly
if
ever
i
got
out
of
this
scrape
i
had
received
a
lesson
at
least
not
to
run
the
same
risk
of
gratuitous
vexation
again
or
even
to
attempt
what
was
uncertain
and
unnecessary
it
is
the
same
in
love
and
in
literature
a
man
makes
love
without
thinking
of
the
chances
of
success
his
own
disabilities
or
the
character
of
his
mistress
that
is
without
connecting
means
with
ends
and
consulting
only
his
own
will
and
passion
the
author
sets
about
writing
history
with
the
full
intention
of
rendering
all
documents
dates
and
facts
secondary
to
his
own
opinion
and
will
in
business
it
is
not
altogether
the
same
for
interest
acts
obviously
as
a
counterpoise
to
caprice
and
will
and
is
the
moving
principle
nor
is
it
so
in
war
for
then
the
spirit
of
contradiction
does
everything
and
an
englishman
will
go
to
the
devil
rather
than
give
up
to
any
odds
courage
is
pure
will
without
regard
to
consequences
and
this
the
english
have
in
perfection
again
poetry
is
our
element
for
the
essence
of
poetry
is
will
and
passion
the
french
poetry
is
detail
and
verbiage
i
have
thus
shown
why
the
english
fail
as
a
people
in
the
fine
arts
namely
because
with
them
the
end
absorbs
the
means
i
have
mentioned
barry
as
an
individual
instance
no
man
spoke
or
wrote
with
more
about
painting
and
yet
no
one
painted
with
less
his
pictures
were
dry
and
coarse
and
wanted
all
that
his
description
of
those
of
others
contained
for
instance
he
speaks
of
the
dull
dead
watery
look
in
the
medusa
head
of
leonardo
which
conveys
a
perfect
idea
of
it
if
he
had
copied
it
you
would
never
have
suspected
anything
of
the
kind
again
he
has
i
believe
somewhere
spoken
of
the
uneasy
effect
of
the
tucker
of
the
bursting
with
the
full
treasures
it
contains
what
a
daub
he
would
have
made
of
it
he
is
like
a
person
admiring
the
grace
of
a
fine
placed
on
the
rope
himself
his
head
turns
and
he
falls
or
like
a
man
admiring
fine
horsemanship
set
him
upon
a
horse
and
he
tumbles
over
on
the
other
side
why
was
this
his
mind
was
essentially
ardent
and
discursive
not
sensitive
or
observing
and
though
the
immediate
object
acted
as
a
stimulus
to
his
imagination
it
was
only
as
it
does
to
a
poet
that
is
as
a
link
in
the
chain
of
association
as
suggesting
other
strong
feelings
and
ideas
and
not
for
its
intrinsic
beauty
or
hidden
details
he
had
not
the
painter
eye
though
he
had
the
painter
knowledge
there
is
as
great
a
difference
in
this
respect
as
between
the
telescope
and
microscope
people
in
general
see
objects
only
to
distinguish
them
in
practice
and
by
name
to
know
that
a
hat
is
a
hat
that
a
chair
is
not
a
table
that
john
is
not
william
and
there
are
painters
particularly
of
history
in
england
who
look
no
farther
they
can
not
finish
anything
or
go
over
a
head
twice
the
first
view
is
all
they
would
arrive
at
nor
can
they
reduce
their
impressions
to
their
component
parts
without
losing
the
spirit
the
effect
of
this
is
grossness
and
want
of
force
for
in
reality
the
component
parts
can
not
be
separated
from
the
whole
such
people
have
no
pleasure
in
the
exercise
of
their
art
as
such
it
is
all
to
astonish
or
to
get
money
that
they
follow
it
or
if
they
are
thrown
out
of
it
they
regret
it
only
as
a
bankrupt
does
a
business
which
was
a
livelihood
to
him
barry
did
not
live
like
titian
in
the
taste
of
colours
they
were
not
a
to
his
sense
he
did
not
hold
green
blue
red
and
yellow
as
the
precious
darlings
of
his
eye
they
did
not
therefore
sink
into
his
mind
or
nourish
and
enrich
it
with
the
sense
of
beauty
though
he
knew
enough
of
them
to
furnish
hints
and
topics
of
discourse
if
he
had
had
the
most
beautiful
object
in
nature
before
him
in
his
in
the
adelphi
he
would
have
neglected
it
after
a
moment
burst
of
admiration
to
talk
of
his
last
composition
or
to
scrawl
some
new
and
vast
design
art
was
nothing
to
him
or
if
anything
merely
a
to
his
ambition
and
display
of
intellectual
power
in
general
and
therefore
he
neglected
it
to
daub
huge
allegories
or
cabal
with
the
academy
where
the
violence
of
his
will
or
the
extent
of
his
views
found
ample
scope
as
a
painter
he
was
valuable
merely
as
a
draughtsman
in
that
part
of
the
art
which
may
be
reduced
to
lines
and
precepts
or
positive
measurement
there
is
neither
colour
nor
expression
nor
delicacy
nor
beauty
in
his
works
essay
ix
matter
and
manner
nothing
can
frequently
be
more
striking
than
the
difference
of
style
or
manner
where
the
remains
the
same
as
in
paraphrases
and
translations
the
most
remarkable
example
which
occurs
to
us
is
in
the
beginning
of
the
and
by
chaucer
and
in
the
modernisation
of
the
same
passage
by
dryden
we
shall
give
an
extract
from
both
that
the
reader
may
judge
for
himself
the
original
runs
thus
i
that
all
this
pleasaunt
sight
sie
thought
sodainly
i
so
sweet
an
aire
of
the
eglentere
that
certainely
there
is
no
heart
i
deme
in
such
dispaire
ne
with
froward
and
contraire
so
overlaid
but
it
soone
have
bote
if
it
had
ones
felt
this
savour
sote
and
as
i
stood
and
cast
aside
mine
eie
i
was
of
ware
the
fairest
medler
tree
that
ever
yet
in
all
my
life
i
sie
as
full
of
blossomes
as
it
be
therein
a
goldfinch
leaping
fro
bough
to
bough
and
as
him
list
eete
of
here
and
there
and
floures
and
to
the
herber
side
was
this
faire
tree
of
which
i
have
you
told
and
at
the
last
the
brid
began
to
when
he
had
eaten
what
he
so
passing
sweetly
that
by
it
was
more
pleasaunt
than
i
devise
and
when
his
song
was
ended
in
this
wise
the
nightingale
with
so
mery
a
note
answered
him
that
all
the
rong
so
sodainly
that
as
it
were
a
sote
i
stood
astonied
so
was
i
with
the
song
thorow
ravished
that
till
late
and
longe
ne
wist
i
in
what
place
i
was
ne
where
and
ay
me
she
song
even
by
mine
ere
wherefore
about
i
waited
busily
on
every
side
if
i
her
see
and
at
the
last
i
gan
full
well
aspie
where
she
sat
in
a
fresh
grene
laurer
tree
on
the
further
side
even
right
by
me
that
gave
so
passing
a
delicious
smell
according
to
the
eglentere
full
well
whereof
i
so
inly
great
pleasure
that
as
me
thought
i
surely
ravished
was
into
paradice
where
my
desire
was
for
to
be
and
no
ferther
to
passe
as
for
that
day
and
on
the
sote
grasse
i
sat
me
downe
for
as
for
mine
entent
the
song
was
more
convenient
and
more
pleasaunt
to
me
by
many
fold
than
meat
or
drinke
or
any
other
thing
thereto
the
herber
was
so
fresh
and
cold
the
wholesome
savours
eke
so
comforting
that
as
i
sith
the
beginning
of
world
was
never
seene
or
than
so
pleasaunt
a
ground
of
none
earthly
man
and
as
i
sat
the
harkening
thus
me
that
i
voices
sodainly
the
most
sweetest
and
most
delicious
that
ever
any
wight
i
trow
truly
heard
in
life
for
the
armony
and
sweet
accord
was
in
so
good
musike
that
the
voices
to
angels
most
was
like
in
this
passage
the
poet
has
let
loose
the
very
soul
of
pleasure
there
is
a
spirit
of
enjoyment
in
it
of
which
there
seems
no
end
it
is
the
intense
delight
which
accompanies
the
description
of
every
object
the
fund
of
natural
sensibility
which
it
displays
which
constitutes
its
whole
essence
and
beauty
now
this
is
shown
chiefly
in
the
manner
in
which
the
different
objects
are
anticipated
and
the
eager
welcome
which
is
given
to
them
in
his
repeating
and
varying
the
circumstances
with
a
restless
delight
in
his
quitting
the
subject
for
a
moment
and
then
returning
to
it
again
as
if
he
could
never
have
his
fill
of
enjoyment
there
is
little
of
this
in
dryden
paraphrase
the
same
ideas
are
introduced
but
not
in
the
same
manner
nor
with
the
same
spirit
the
imagination
of
the
poet
is
not
borne
along
with
the
tide
of
pleasure
the
verse
is
not
poured
out
like
the
natural
strains
it
describes
from
pure
delight
but
according
to
rule
and
measure
instead
of
being
absorbed
in
his
subject
he
is
dissatisfied
with
it
tries
to
give
an
air
of
dignity
to
it
by
factitious
ornaments
to
amuse
the
reader
by
ingenious
allusions
and
divert
his
attention
from
the
progress
of
the
story
by
the
artifices
of
the
style
painted
birds
companions
of
the
spring
hopping
from
spray
to
spray
were
heard
to
sing
both
eyes
and
ears
receiv
a
like
delight
enchanting
music
and
a
charming
sight
on
philomel
i
fix
my
whole
desire
and
listen
for
the
queen
of
all
the
quire
fain
would
i
hear
her
heavenly
voice
to
sing
and
wanted
yet
an
omen
to
the
spring
thus
as
i
mus
i
cast
aside
my
eye
and
saw
a
was
planted
nigh
the
spreading
branches
made
a
goodly
show
and
full
of
opening
blooms
was
every
bough
a
goldfinch
there
i
saw
with
gawdy
pride
of
painted
plumes
that
hopp
from
side
to
side
still
pecking
as
she
pass
and
still
she
drew
the
sweets
from
every
flower
and
suck
the
dew
suffic
at
length
she
warbled
in
her
throat
and
tun
her
voice
to
many
a
merry
note
but
indistinct
and
neither
sweet
nor
clear
yet
such
as
sooth
my
soul
and
pleas
my
ear
her
short
performance
was
no
sooner
tried
when
she
i
sought
the
nightingale
replied
so
sweet
so
shrill
so
variously
she
sung
that
the
grove
echoed
and
the
valleys
rung
and
i
so
ravish
with
her
heavenly
note
i
stood
entranced
and
had
no
room
for
thought
but
all
with
ecstasy
of
bliss
was
in
a
pleasing
dream
of
paradise
at
length
i
wak
and
looking
round
the
bower
search
every
tree
and
pry
on
every
flower
if
any
where
by
chance
i
might
espy
the
rural
poet
of
the
melody
for
still
methought
she
sung
not
far
away
at
last
i
found
her
on
a
laurel
spray
close
by
my
side
she
sat
and
fair
in
sight
full
in
a
line
against
her
opposite
where
stood
with
eglantine
the
laurel
twin
and
both
their
native
sweets
were
well
conjoin
on
the
green
bank
i
sat
and
listen
long
sitting
was
more
convenient
for
the
song
nor
till
her
lay
was
ended
could
i
move
but
wish
to
dwell
for
ever
in
the
grove
only
methought
the
time
too
swiftly
pass
and
every
note
i
fear
would
be
the
last
my
sight
and
smell
and
hearing
were
employ
and
all
three
senses
in
full
gust
enjoy
and
what
alone
did
all
the
rest
surpass
the
sweet
possession
of
the
fairy
place
single
and
conscious
to
myself
alone
of
pleasures
to
the
excluded
world
unknown
pleasures
which
no
where
else
were
to
be
found
and
all
elysium
in
a
spot
of
ground
thus
while
i
sat
intent
to
see
and
hear
and
drew
perfumes
of
more
than
vital
air
all
suddenly
i
heard
the
approaching
sound
of
vocal
music
on
the
enchanted
ground
a
host
of
saints
it
seem
so
full
the
quire
as
if
the
bless
above
did
all
conspire
to
join
their
voices
and
neglect
the
lyre
compared
with
chaucer
dryden
and
the
rest
of
that
school
were
merely
they
had
a
great
deal
of
wit
sense
and
fancy
they
only
wanted
truth
and
depth
of
feeling
but
i
shall
have
to
say
more
on
this
subject
when
i
come
to
consider
the
old
question
which
i
have
got
marked
down
in
my
list
whether
pope
was
a
poet
lord
chesterfield
character
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
is
a
good
illustration
of
his
general
theory
he
says
all
the
men
i
ever
knew
in
my
life
and
i
knew
him
extremely
well
the
late
duke
of
marlborough
possessed
the
graces
in
the
highest
degree
not
to
say
engrossed
them
for
i
will
venture
contrary
to
the
custom
of
profound
historians
who
always
assign
deep
causes
for
great
events
to
ascribe
the
better
half
of
the
duke
of
marlborough
greatness
and
riches
to
those
graces
he
was
eminently
illiterate
wrote
bad
english
and
spelt
it
worse
he
had
no
share
of
what
is
commonly
called
parts
that
is
no
brightness
nothing
shining
in
his
genius
he
had
most
undoubtedly
an
excellent
good
plain
understanding
with
sound
judgment
but
these
alone
would
probably
have
raised
him
but
something
higher
than
they
found
him
which
was
page
to
king
james
ii
queen
there
the
graces
protected
and
promoted
him
for
while
he
was
ensign
of
the
guards
the
duchess
of
cleveland
then
favourite
mistress
of
charles
struck
by
these
very
graces
gave
him
five
thousand
pounds
with
which
he
immediately
bought
an
annuity
of
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
which
was
the
foundation
of
his
subsequent
fortune
his
figure
was
beautiful
but
his
manner
was
irresistible
by
either
man
or
woman
it
was
by
this
engaging
graceful
manner
that
he
was
enabled
during
all
his
wars
to
connect
the
various
and
jarring
powers
of
the
grand
alliance
and
to
carry
them
on
to
the
main
object
of
the
war
notwithstanding
their
private
and
separate
views
jealousies
and
wrongheadedness
whatever
court
he
went
to
and
he
was
often
obliged
to
go
himself
to
some
resty
and
refractory
ones
he
as
constantly
prevailed
and
brought
them
into
his
measures
grace
in
women
has
often
more
effect
than
beauty
we
sometimes
see
a
certain
fine
an
habitual
voluptuousness
of
character
which
reposes
on
its
own
sensations
and
derives
pleasure
from
all
around
it
that
is
more
irresistible
than
any
other
attraction
there
is
an
air
of
languid
enjoyment
in
such
persons
their
eyes
in
their
arms
and
their
hands
and
their
face
which
robs
us
of
ourselves
and
draws
us
by
a
secret
sympathy
towards
them
their
minds
are
a
shrine
where
pleasure
reposes
their
smile
diffuses
a
sensation
like
the
breath
of
spring
petrarch
description
of
laura
answers
exactly
to
this
character
which
is
indeed
the
italian
character
titian
pictures
are
full
of
it
they
seem
sustained
by
sentiment
or
as
if
the
persons
whom
he
painted
sat
to
music
there
is
one
in
the
louvre
or
there
was
which
had
the
most
of
this
expression
i
ever
remember
it
did
not
look
downward
looked
forward
beyond
this
world
it
was
a
look
that
never
passed
away
but
remained
unalterable
as
the
deep
sentiment
which
gave
birth
to
it
it
is
the
same
constitutional
character
together
with
infinite
activity
of
mind
which
has
enabled
the
greatest
man
in
modern
history
to
bear
his
reverses
of
fortune
with
gay
magnanimity
and
to
submit
to
the
loss
of
the
empire
of
the
world
with
as
little
discomposure
as
if
he
had
been
playing
a
game
at
chess
after
all
i
would
not
be
understood
to
say
that
manner
is
everything
nor
would
i
put
euclid

sir
isaac
newton
on
a
level
with
the
first
we
might
happen
to
meet
i
consider
to
have
been
a
greater
work
of
genius
than
translation
of
them
though
i
am
not
sure
that
i
should
not
prefer

his

the
elegant

have
been
objected
to
me
to
show
the
frivolity
of
external
accomplishments
and
the
facility
with
which
they
are
acquired
as
to
the
last
point
i
demur
there
are
no
class
of
people
who
lead
so
laborious
a
life
or
who
take
more
pains
to
cultivate
their
minds
as

about

i

once
saying
to
this
gentleman
a
great
while
ago
that
i
did
not
seem
to
have
altered
any
of
my
ideas
since
i
was
sixteen
years
old
then
said
he
are
no
wiser
now
than
you
were
then
i
might
make
the
same
confession
and
the
same
retort
would
apply
still
coleridge
used
to
tell
me
that
this
pertinacity
was
owing
to
a
want
of
sympathy
with
others
what
he
calls
with
is
their
admiring
him
and
it
must
be
admitted
that
he
varies
his
battery
pretty
often
in
order
to
accommodate
himself
to
this
sort
of
mutual
understanding
but
i
do
not
agree
in
what
he
says
of
me
on
the
other
hand
i
think
that
it
is
my
sympathising
with
the
different
views
and
feelings
that
may
be
entertained
on
a
subject
that
prevents
me
retracting
my
judgment
and
flinging
myself
into
the
contrary
extreme
if
you
proscribe
all
opinion
opposite
to
your
own
and
impertinently
exclude
all
the
evidence
that
does
not
make
for
you
it
stares
you
in
the
face
with
double
force
when
it
breaks
in
unexpectedly
upon
you
or
if
at
any
subsequent
period
it
happens
to
suit
your
interest
or
convenience
to
listen
to
objections
which
vanity
or
prudence
had
hitherto
overlooked
but
if
you
are
aware
from
the
first
suggestion
of
a
subject
either
by
subtlety
or
tact
or
close
attention
of
the
full
force
of
what
others
possibly
feel
and
think
of
it
you
are
not
exposed
to
the
same
vacillation
of
opinion
the
number
of
grains
and
scruples
of
doubts
and
difficulties
thrown
into
the
scale
while
the
balance
is
yet
undecided
add
to
the
weight
and
steadiness
of
the
determination
he
who
anticipates
his
arguments
confirms
while
he
corrects
his
own
reasonings
when
a
question
has
been
carefully
examined
in
all
its
bearings
and
a
principle
is
once
established
it
is
not
liable
to
be
overthrown
by
any
new
facts
which
have
been
arbitrarily
and
petulantly
set
aside
nor
by
every
wind
of
idle
doctrine
rushing
into
the
interstices
of
a
hollow
speculation
shattering
it
in
pieces
and
leaving
it
a
mockery
and
a
like
those
tall
gawky
staring
pyramidal
erections
which
are
seen
scattered
over
different
parts
of
the
country
and
are
called
the
of
different
gentlemen
a
man
may
be
confident
in
maintaining
a
side
as
he
has
been
cautious
in
choosing
it
if
after
making
up
his
mind
strongly
in
one
way
to
the
best
of
his
capacity
and
judgment
he
feels
himself
inclined
to
a
very
violent
revulsion
of
sentiment
he
may
generally
rest
assured
that
the
change
is
in
himself
and
his
motives
not
in
the
reason
of
things
i
can
not
say
that
from
my
own
experience
i
have
found
that
the
persons
most
remarkable
for
sudden
and
violent
changes
of
principle
have
been
cast
in
the
softest
or
most
susceptible
mould
all
their
notions
have
been
exclusive
bigoted
and
intolerant
their
want
of
consistency
and
moderation
has
been
in
exact
proportion
to
their
want
of
candour
and
comprehensiveness
of
mind
instead
of
being
the
creatures
of
sympathy
open
to
conviction
unwilling
to
give
offence
by
the
smallest
difference
of
sentiment
they
have
for
the
most
part
been
made
up
of
mere
antipathies
a
very
repulsive
sort
of
personages
at
odds
with
themselves
and
with
everybody
else
the
slenderness
of
their
pretensions
to
philosophical
inquiry
has
been
accompanied
with
the
most
presumptuous
dogmatism
they
have
been
persons
of
that
narrowness
of
view
and
headstrong
of
purpose
that
they
could
see
only
one
side
of
a
question
at
a
time
and
whichever
they
pleased
there
is
a
story
somewhere
in
of
two
champions
coming
to
a
shield
hung
up
against
a
tree
with
an
inscription
written
on
each
side
of
it
each
of
them
maintained
that
the
words
were
what
was
written
on
the
side
next
him
and
never
dreamt
till
the
fray
was
over
that
they
might
be
different
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
shield
it
would
have
been
a
little
more
extraordinary
if
the
combatants
had
changed
sides
in
the
heat
of
the
scuffle
and
stoutly
denied
that
there
were
any
such
words
on
the
opposite
side
as
they
had
before
been
bent
on
sacrificing
their
lives
to
prove
were
the
only
ones
it
contained
yet
such
is
the
very
situation
of
some
of
our
modern
polemics
they
have
been
of
all
sides
of
the
question
and
yet
they
can
not
conceive
how
an
honest
man
can
be
of
any
but
one
that
which
they
hold
at
present
it
seems
that
they
are
afraid
to
look
their
old
opinions
in
the
face
lest
they
should
be
fascinated
by
them
once
more
they
banish
all
doubts
of
their
own
sincerity
by
inveighing
against
the
motives
of
their
antagonists
there
is
no
salvation
out
of
the
pale
of
their
strange
inconsistency
they
reduce
common
sense
and
probity
to
the
straitest
possible
limits
the
breasts
of
themselves
and
their
patrons
they
are
like
people
out
at
sea
on
a
very
narrow
plank
who
try
to
push
everybody
else
off
is
it
that
they
have
so
little
faith
in
the
course
to
which
they
have
become
such
staunch
converts
as
to
suppose
that
should
they
allow
a
grain
of
sense
to
their
old
allies
and
new
antagonists
they
will
have
more
than
they
is
it
that
they
have
so
little
consciousness
of
their
own
disinterestedness
that
they
feel
if
they
allow
a
particle
of
honesty
to
those
who
now
differ
with
them
they
will
have
more
than
they
those
opinions
must
needs
be
of
a
very
fragile
texture
which
will
not
stand
the
shock
of
the
least
acknowledged
opposition
and
which
lay
claim
to
respectability
by
stigmatising
all
who
do
not
hold
them
as
and
knaves
and
cowards
there
is
a
want
of
feeling
in
every
such
instance
of
extravagant
versatility
a
something
crude
unripe
and
harsh
that
does
not
hit
a
judicious
palate
but
sets
the
teeth
on
edge
to
think
of
had
rather
hear
my
mother
cat
mew
or
a
wheel
grate
on
the
axletree
than
one
of
these
same
chaunt
his
incondite
retrograde
lays
without
rhyme
and
without
reason
the
principles
and
professions
change
the
man
remains
the
same
there
is
the
same
spirit
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
pragmatical
fickleness
and
virulence
whether
it
runs
into
one
extreme
or
another
to
wit
a
confinement
of
view
a
jealousy
of
others
an
impatience
of
contradiction
a
want
of
liberality
in
construing
the
motives
of
others
either
from
monkish
pedantry
or
a
conceited
overweening
reference
of
everything
to
our
own
fancies
and
feelings
there
is
something
to
be
said
indeed
for
the
nature
of
the
political
machinery
for
the
whirling
motion
of
the
revolutionary
wheel
which
has
of
late
wrenched
men
understandings
almost
asunder
and
the
very
faculties
of
eyes
and
ears
but
still
this
is
hardly
a
sufficient
reason
why
the
adept
in
the
old
as
well
as
the
new
school
should
take
such
a
prodigious
latitude
himself
while
at
the
same
time
he
makes
so
little
allowance
for
others
his
whole
creed
need
not
be
turned
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
even
in
times
like
these
he
need
not
in
the
rage
of
party
spirit
discard
the
proper
attributes
of
humanity
the
common
dictates
of
reason
he
need
not
outrage
every
former
feeling
nor
trample
on
every
customary
decency
in
his
zeal
for
reform
or
in
his
greater
zeal
against
it
if
his
mind
like
his
body
has
undergone
a
total
change
of
essence
and
purged
off
the
taint
of
all
its
early
opinions
he
need
not
carry
about
with
him
or
be
haunted
in
the
persons
of
others
with
the
phantoms
of
his
altered
principles
to
loathe
and
execrate
them
he
need
not
as
it
were
pass
an
act
of
attainder
on
all
his
thoughts
hopes
wishes
from
youth
upwards
to
offer
them
at
the
shrine
of
matured
servility
he
need
not
become
one
vile
antithesis
a
living
and
ignominious
satire
on
himself
a
gentleman
went
to
live
some
years
ago
in
a
remote
part
of
the
country
and
as
he
did
not
wish
to
affect
singularity
he
used
to
have
two
candles
on
his
table
of
an
evening
a
romantic
acquaintance
of
his
in
the
neighbourhood
smit
with
the
love
of
simplicity
and
equality
used
to
come
in
and
without
ceremony
snuff
one
of
them
out
saying
it
was
a
shame
to
indulge
in
such
extravagance
while
many
poor
cottagers
had
not
even
a
rushlight
to
see
to
do
their
evening
work
by
this
might
be
about
the
year
and
was
passed
over
as
among
the
ordinary
occurrences
of
the
day
in
oh
fearful
lapse
of
time
pregnant
with
strange
mutability
the
same
enthusiastic
lover
of
economy
and
hater
of
luxury
asked
his
thoughtless
friend
to
dine
with
him
in
company
with
a
certain
lord
and
to
lend
him
his
manservant
to
wait
at
table
and
just
before
they
were
sitting
down
to
dinner
he
heard
him
say
to
the
servant
in
a
sonorous
whisper
be
sure
you
do
forget
to
have
six
candles
on
the
table
extremes
meet
the
event
here
was
as
true
to
itself
as
the
oscillation
of
the
pendulum
my
informant
who
understands
moral
equations
had
looked
for
this
reaction
and
noted
it
down
as
characteristic
the
impertinence
in
the
first
instance
was
the
cue
to
the
ostentatious
servility
in
the
second
the
one
was
the
fulfilment
of
the
other
like
the
type
and
of
a
prophecy
no
the
keeping
of
the
character
at
the
end
of
fourteen
years
was
as
unique
as
the
keeping
of
the
thought
to
the
end
of
the
fourteen
lines
of
a
sonnet
would
it
sound
strange
if
i
were
to
whisper
it
in
the
reader
ear
that
it
was
the
same
person
who
was
thus
anxious
to
see
six
candles
on
the
table
to
receive
a
lord
who
once
in
ages
past
said
to
me
that
saw
nothing
to
admire
in
the
eloquence
of
such
men
as
mansfield
and
chatham
and
what
did
it
all
end
in
but
their
being
made
lords
it
is
better
to
be
a
lord
than
a
lacquey
to
a
lord
so
we
see
that
the
swelling
pride
and
preposterous
which
exalts
itself
above
the
mightiest
looking
down
upon
and
braving
the
boasted
pretensions
of
the
highest
rank
and
the
most
brilliant
talents
as
nothing
compared
with
its
own
conscious
powers
and
silent
unmoved
grovels
and
licks
the
dust
before
titled
wealth
like
a
lacquered
slave
the
moment
it
can
get
wages
and
a
livery
would
milton
or
marvel
have
done
this
coleridge
indeed
sets
down
this
outrageous
want
of
keeping
to
an
excess
of
sympathy
and
there
is
after
all
some
truth
in
his
suggestion
there
is
a
craving
after
the
approbation
and
concurrence
of
others
natural
to
the
mind
of
man
it
is
difficult
to
sustain
the
weight
of
an
opinion
singly
for
any
length
of
way
the
intellect
languishes
without
cordial
encouragement
and
support
it
exhausts
both
strength
and
patience
to
be
always
striving
against
the
stream
audentior
is
the
motto
but
of
few
public
opinion
is
always
pressing
upon
the
mind
and
like
the
air
we
breathe
acts
unseen
unfelt
it
supplies
the
living
current
of
our
thoughts
and
infects
without
our
knowledge
it
taints
the
blood
and
is
taken
into
the
smallest
pores
the
most
sanguine
constitutions
are
perhaps
the
most
exposed
to
its
influence
but
public
opinion
has
its
source
in
power
in
popular
prejudice
and
is
not
always
in
accord
with
right
reason
or
a
high
and
abstracted
imagination
which
path
to
follow
where
the
two
roads
part
the
heroic
and
romantic
resolution
prevails
at
first
in
high
and
heroic
tempers
they
think
to
scale
the
heights
of
truth
and
virtue
at
once
with
him
genius
had
angelic
wings
and
fed
on
manna
but
after
a
time
find
themselves
baffled
toiling
on
in
an
uphill
road
without
friends
in
a
cold
neighbourhood
without
aid
or
prospect
of
success
the
poet
a
worm
goes
by
the
way
he
hears
murmurs
loud
or
suppressed
meets
blank
looks
or
scowling
faces
is
exposed
to
the
pelting
of
the
pitiless
press
and
is
stunned
by
the
shout
of
the
mob
that
gather
round
him
to
see
what
sort
of
a
creature
a
poet
and
a
philosopher
is
what
is
there
to
make
him
proof
against
all
this
a
strength
of
understanding
steeled
against
temptation
and
a
dear
love
of
truth
that
smiles
opinion
to
scorn
these
he
perhaps
has
not
a
lord
passes
in
his
coach
might
he
not
get
up
and
ride
out
of
the
reach
of
the
he
is
invited
to
stop
dinner
if
he
stays
he
might
insinuate
some
wholesome
truths
he
drinks
in
rank
poison
flattery
he
recites
some
verses
to
the
ladies
who
smile
delicious
praise
and
thank
him
through
their
tears
the
master
of
the
house
suggests
a
happy
allusion
in
the
turn
of
an
expression
sympathy
this
is
better
than
the
company
he
lately
left
pictures
statues
meet
his
raptured
eye
our
ulysses
finds
himself
in
the
gardens
of
alcinous
our
truant
is
fairly
caught
he
wanders
through
enchanted
ground
groves
classic
groves
nod
unto
him
and
he
hears
voices
hailing
him
as
brother
bard
he
sleeps
dreams
and
wakes
cured
of
his
thriftless
prejudices
and
morose
philanthropy
he
likes
this
courtly
and
popular
sympathy
better
looks
up
with
awe
to
kings
with
honour
to
nobility
with
reverence
to
magistrates
etc
he
no
longer
breathes
the
air
of
heaven
and
his
own
thoughts
but
is
steeped
in
that
of
palaces
and
courts
and
finds
it
agree
better
with
his
constitutional
temperament
oh
how
sympathy
alters
a
man
from
what
he
was
heard
of
hearts
unkind
kind
deeds
with
cold
returning
alas
the
gratitude
of
man
has
oftener
set
me
mourning
a
spirit
of
contradiction
a
wish
to
monopolise
all
wisdom
will
not
account
for
uniform
consistency
for
it
is
sure
to
defeat
and
turn
against
itself
it
is
by
turns
and
nothing
long
it
is
warped
and
crooked
it
can
not
bear
the
least
opposition
and
sooner
than
acquiesce
in
what
others
approve
it
will
change
sides
in
a
day
it
is
offended
at
every
resistance
to
its
captious
domineering
humour
and
will
quarrel
for
straws
with
its
best
friends
a
person
under
the
guidance
of
this
demon
if
every
whimsy
or
occult
discovery
of
his
own
is
not
received
with
acclamation
by
one
party
will
wreak
his
spite
by
deserting
to
the
other
and
carry
all
his
talent
for
disputation
with
him
sharpened
by
rage
and
disappointment
a
man
to
be
steady
in
a
cause
should
be
more
attached
to
the
truth
than
to
the
acquiescence
of
his
fellow
citizens
i
can
hardly
consider
coleridge
a
deserter
from
the
cause
he
first
espoused
unless
one
could
tell
what
cause
he
ever
heartily
espoused
or
what
party
he
ever
belonged
to
in
downright
earnest
he
has
not
been
inconsistent
with
himself
at
different
times
but
at
all
times
he
is
a
sophist
a
casuist
a
rhetorician
what
you
please
and
might
have
argued
or
declaimed
to
the
end
of
his
breath
on
one
side
of
a
question
or
another
but
he
never
was
a
pragmatical
fellow
he
lived
in
a
round
of
contradictions
and
never
came
to
a
settled
point
his
fancy
gave
the
cue
to
his
judgment
and
his
vanity
set
his
invention
afloat
in
whatever
direction
he
could
find
most
scope
for
it
or
most
that
is
admiration
his
life
and
opinions
might
naturally
receive
the
title
of
one
of
hume
essays
sceptical
solution
of
sceptical
to
be
sure
his
and
his
breathe
a
somewhat
different
tone
on
subjects
of
a
particular
description
both
of
them
apparently
pretty
but
whoever
will
be
at
the
pains
to
examine
them
closely
will
find
them
to
be
fugues
solemn
capriccios
not
set
compositions
with
any
malice
prepense
in
them
or
much
practical
meaning
i
believe
some
of
his
friends
who
were
indebted
to
him
for
the
suggestion
of
plausible
reasons
for
conformity
and
an
opening
to
a
more
qualified
view
of
the
letter
of
their
paradoxical
principles
have
lately
disgusted
him
by
the
virulence
and
extravagance
to
which
they
have
carried
hints
of
which
he
never
suspected
that
they
would
make
the
least
possible
use
but
if
coleridge
is
satisfied
with
the
wandering
moods
of
his
mind
perhaps
this
is
no
reason
that
others
may
not
reap
the
solid
benefit
he
himself
is
like
the
idle
seaweed
on
the
ocean
tossed
from
shore
to
shore
they
are
like
barnacles
fastened
to
the
vessel
of
state
rotting
its
goodly
timbers
there
are
some
persons
who
are
of
too
fastidious
a
turn
of
mind
to
like
anything
long
or
to
assent
twice
to
the
same
opinion
always
sets
himself
to
prop
the
falling
cause
to
nurse
the
rickety
bantling
he
takes
the
part
which
he
thinks
in
most
need
of
his
support
not
so
much
out
of
magnanimity
as
to
prevent
too
great
a
degree
of
presumption
or
on
the
triumphant
side
truth
be
truth
yet
he
contrives
to
throw
such
changes
of
vexation
on
it
as
it
may
lose
some
colour
i
have
been
delighted
to
hear
him
expatiate
with
the
most
natural
and
affecting
simplicity
on
a
favourite
passage
or
picture
and
all
the
while
afraid
of
agreeing
with
him
lest
he
should
instantly
turn
round
and
unsay
all
that
he
had
said
for
fear
of
my
going
away
with
too
good
an
opinion
of
my
own
taste
or
too
great
an
admiration
of
my
idol
and
his
own
i
dare
not
ask
his
opinion
twice
if
i
have
got
a
favourable
sentence
once
lest
he
should
belie
his
own
sentiments
to
stagger
mine
i
have
heard
him
talk
divinely
like
one
inspired
of
boccaccio
and
the
story
of
the
pot
of
basil
describing
it
grew
and
it
grew
and
it
grew
till
you
saw
it
spread
its
tender
leaves
in
the
light
of
his
eye
and
wave
in
the
tremulous
sound
of
his
voice
and
yet
if
you
asked
him
about
it
another
time
he
would
perhaps
affect
to
think
little
of
it
or
to
have
forgotten
the
circumstance
his
enthusiasm
is
fickle
and
treacherous
the
instant
he
finds
it
shared
in
common
he
backs
out
of
it
his
enmity
is
equally
refined
but
hardly
so
unsocial
his
invectives
display
all
the
beauty
of
scorn
and
impart
elegance
to
vulgarity
he
sometimes
finds
out
minute
excellences
and
cries
up
one
thing
to
put
you
out
of
conceit
with
another
if
you
want
him
to
praise
sir
joshua
in
his
best
manner
you
should
begin
with
saying
something
about
titian
if
you
seem
an
idoliser
of
sir
joshua
he
will
immediately
turn
off
the
discourse
gliding
like
the
serpent
before
eve
wary
and
beautiful
to
the
graces
of
sir
peter
lely
or
ask
if
you
saw
a
vandyke
the
other
day
which
he
does
not
think
sir
joshua
could
stand
near
but
find
fault
with
the
lake
poets
and
mention
some
pretended
patron
of
rising
genius
and
you
need
not
fear
but
he
will
join
in
with
you
and
go
all
lengths
that
you
can
wish
him
you
may
calculate
upon
him
there
elevates
and
joy
brightens
his
face
and
indeed
so
eloquent
is
he
and
so
beautiful
in
his
eloquence
that
i
myself
with
all
my
freedom
from
gall
and
bitterness
could
listen
to
him
untired
and
without
knowing
how
the
time
went
losing
and
neglecting
many
a
meal
and
hour
morn
to
noon
from
noon
to
dewy
eve
a
summer
day
when
i
cease
to
hear
him
quite
other
tongues
turned
to
what
accents
they
may
of
praise
or
blame
would
sound
dull
ungrateful
out
of
tune
and
harsh
in
the
comparison
an
overstrained
enthusiasm
produces
a
capriciousness
in
taste
as
well
as
too
much
indifference
a
person
who
sets
no
bounds
to
his
admiration
takes
a
surfeit
of
his
favourites
he
overdoes
the
thing
he
gets
sick
of
his
own
everlasting
praises
and
affected
raptures
his
preferences
are
a
great
deal
too
violent
to
last
he
wears
out
an
author
in
a
week
that
might
last
him
a
year
or
his
life
by
the
eagerness
with
which
he
devours
him
every
such
favourite
is
in
his
turn
the
greatest
writer
in
the
world
compared
with
the
lord
of
the
ascendent
for
the
time
being
shakspeare
is
commonplace
and
milton
a
pedant
a
little
insipid
or
so
some
of
these
prodigies
require
to
be
dragged
out
of
their
and
cried
up
to
the
top
of
the
compass
their
traits
are
subtle
and
must
be
violently
obtruded
on
the
sight
but
the
effort
of
exaggerated
praise
though
it
may
stagger
others
tires
the
maker
and
we
hear
of
them
no
more
after
a
while
others
take
their
turns
are
swallowed
whole
undigested
ravenously
and
disappear
in
the
same
manner
good
authors
share
the
fate
of
bad
and
a
library
in
a
few
years
is
nearly
dismantled
it
is
a
pity
thus
to
outlive
our
admiration
and
exhaust
our
relish
of
what
is
excellent
actors
and
actresses
are
disposed
of
in
the
same
conclusive
peremptory
way
some
of
them
are
talked
of
for
months
nay
years
then
it
is
almost
an
offence
to
mention
them
friends
acquaintance
go
the
same
road
are
now
asked
to
come
six
days
in
the
week
then
warned
against
coming
the
seventh
the
smallest
faults
are
soon
magnified
in
those
we
think
too
highly
of
but
where
shall
we
find
perfection
if
we
will
put
up
with
nothing
short
of
that
we
shall
have
neither
pictures
books
nor
friends
left
we
shall
have
nothing
but
our
own
absurdities
to
keep
company
with
all
things
a
regular
and
moderate
indulgence
is
the
best
security
for
a
lasting
enjoyment
there
are
numbers
who
judge
by
the
event
and
change
with
fortune
they
extol
the
hero
of
the
day
and
join
the
prevailing
clamour
whatever
it
is
so
that
the
fluctuating
state
of
public
opinion
regulates
their
feverish
restless
enthusiasm
like
a
thermometer
they
blow
hot
or
cold
according
as
the
wind
sets
favourably
or
otherwise
with
such
people
the
only
infallible
test
of
merit
is
success
and
no
arguments
are
true
that
have
not
a
large
or
powerful
majority
on
their
side
they
go
by
appearances
their
vanity
not
the
truth
is
their
ruling
object
they
are
not
the
last
to
quit
a
falling
cause
and
they
are
the
first
to
hail
the
rising
sun
their
minds
want
sincerity
modesty
and
keeping
with
them
have
done
is
to
hang
quite
out
of
fashion
like
a
rusty
mail
in
monumental
mockery
they
still
one
consent
praise
gauds
and
fame
as
they
construe
it
is
a
fashionable
host
that
slightly
shakes
his
parting

by
the

and
with
his
arms
outstretch
as
he
would
fly
grasps
the
in
comer
welcome
ever
smiles
and
farewell
goes
out
sighing
such
servile
flatterers
made
an
idol
of
buonaparte
while
fortune
smiled
upon
him
but
when
it
left
him
they
removed
him
from
his
pedestal
in
the
cabinet
of
their
vanity
as
we
take
down
the
picture
of
a
relation
that
has
died
without
naming
us
in
his
will
the
opinion
of
such
triflers
is
worth
nothing
it
is
merely
an
echo
we
do
not
want
to
be
told
the
event
of
a
question
but
the
rights
of
it
truth
is
in
their
theory
nothing
but
and
inexplicable
dumb
show
they
are
the
heralds
outriders
and
trumpeters
in
the
procession
of
fame
are
more
loud
and
boisterous
than
the
rest
and
give
themselves
great
airs
as
the
avowed
patrons
and
admirers
of
genius
and
merit
as
there
are
many
who
change
their
sentiments
with
circumstances
as
they
decided
lawsuits
in
rabelais
with
the
dice
so
there
are
others
who
change
them
with
their
acquaintance
me
your
company
and
tell
you
your
opinions
might
be
said
to
many
a
man
who
piques
himself
on
a
select
and
superior
view
of
things
distinct
from
the
vulgar
individuals
of
this
class
are
quick
and
versatile
but
they
are
not
beforehand
with
opinion
they
catch
it
when
it
is
pointed
out
to
them
and
take
it
at
the
rebound
instead
of
giving
the
first
impulse
their
minds
are
a
light
luxuriant
soil
into
which
thoughts
are
easily
transplanted
and
shoot
up
with
uncommon
sprightliness
and
vigour
they
wear
the
dress
of
other
people
minds
very
gracefully
and
unconsciously
they
tell
you
your
own
opinion
or
very
gravely
repeat
an
observation
you
have
made
to
them
about
half
a
year
afterwards
they
let
you
into
the
delicacies
and
luxuries
of
spenser
with
great
disinterestedness
in
return
for
your
having
introduced
that
author
to
their
notice
they
prefer
west
to
raphael
stothard
to
rubens
till
they
are
told
better
still
they
are
acute
in
the
main
and
good
judges
in
their
way
by
trying
to
improve
their
tastes
and
reform
their
notions
according
to
an
ideal
standard
they
perhaps
spoil
and
muddle
their
native
faculties
rather
than
do
them
any
good
their
first
manner
is
their
best
because
it
is
the
most
natural
it
is
well
not
to
go
out
of
ourselves
and
to
be
contented
to
take
up
with
what
we
are
for
better
for
worse
we
can
neither
beg
borrow
nor
steal
characteristic
excellences
some
views
and
modes
of
thinking
suit
certain
minds
as
certain
colours
suit
certain
complexions
we
may
part
with
very
shining
and
very
useful
qualities
without
getting
better
ones
to
supply
them
mocking
is
catching
only
in
regard
to
defects
mimicry
is
always
dangerous
it
is
not
necessary
to
change
our
road
in
order
to
advance
on
our
journey
we
should
cultivate
the
spot
of
ground
we
possess
to
the
utmost
of
our
power
though
it
may
be
circumscribed
and
comparatively
barren
rolling
stone
gathers
no
people
may
collect
all
the
wisdom
they
will
ever
attain
quite
as
well
by
staying
at
home
as
by
travelling
abroad
there
is
no
use
in
shifting
from
place
to
place
from
side
to
side
or
from
subject
to
subject
you
have
always
to
begin
again
and
never
finish
any
course
of
study
or
observation
by
adhering
to
the
same
principles
you
do
not
become
stationary
you
enlarge
correct
and
consolidate
your
reasonings
without
contradicting
and
shuffling
about
in
your
conclusions
if
truth
consisted
in
hasty
assumptions
and
petulant
contradictions
there
might
be
some
ground
for
this
whiffling
and
violent
inconsistency
but
the
face
of
truth
like
that
of
nature
is
different
and
the
same
the
first
outline
of
an
opinion
and
the
general
tone
of
thinking
may
be
sound
and
correct
though
we
may
spend
any
quantity
of
time
and
pains
in
working
up
and
uniting
the
parts
at
subsequent
sittings
if
we
have
misconceived
the
character
of
the
countenance
altogether
at
first
no
alterations
will
bring
it
right
afterwards
those
who
mistake
white
for
black
in
the
first
instance
may
as
well
mistake
black
for
white
when
they
reverse
their
canvas
i
do
not
see
what
security
they
can
have
in
their
present
opinions
who
build
their
pretensions
to
wisdom
on
the
total
folly
rashness
and
extravagance
to
say
no
worse
of
their
former
ones
the
perspective
may
change
with
years
and
experience
we
may
see
certain
things
nearer
and
others
more
remote
but
the
great
masses
and
landmarks
will
remain
though
thrown
into
shadow
and
tinged
by
the
intervening
atmosphere
so
the
laws
of
the
understanding
the
truth
of
nature
will
remain
and
can
not
be
thrown
into
utter
confusion
and
perplexity
by
our
blunders
or
caprice
like
the
objects
in
hogarth
of
where
everything
is
turned
upside
down
or
thrust
out
of
its
place
i
can
not
understand
how
our
political
harlequins
feel
after
all
their
summersaults
and
metamorphoses
they
can
hardly
i
should
think
look
at
themselves
in
the
glass
or
walk
across
the
room
without
stumbling
this
at
least
would
be
the
case
if
they
had
the
least
reflection
or
but
they
judge
from
pique
and
vanity
solely
there
should
be
a
certain
decorum
in
life
as
in
a
picture
without
which
it
is
neither
useful
nor
agreeable
if
my
opinions
are
not
right
at
any
rate
they
are
the
best
i
have
been
able
to
form
and
better
than
any
others
i
could
take
up
at
random
or
out
of
perversity
now
contrary
opinions
vitiate
one
another
and
destroy
the
simplicity
and
clearness
of
the
mind
nothing
is
good
that
has
not
a
beginning
a
middle
and
an
end
and
i
would
wish
my
thoughts
to
be
each
to
each
by
natural
piety
essay
xi
project
for
a
new
theory
of
civil
and
criminal
legislation
when
i
was
about
fourteen
as
long
ago
as
the
year
in
consequence
of
a
dispute
one
day
after
coming
out
of
meeting
between
my
father
and
an
old
lady
of
the
congregation
respecting
the
repeal
of
the
corporation
and
test
acts
and
the
limits
of
religious
toleration
i
set
about
forming
in
my
head
the
first
time
i
ever
attempted
to
think
the
following
system
of
political
rights
and
general
jurisprudence
it
was
this
circumstance
that
decided
the
fate
of
my
future
life
or
rather
i
would
say
it
was
from
an
original
bias
or
craving
to
be
satisfied
of
the
reason
of
things
that
i
seized
hold
of
this
accidental
opportunity
to
indulge
in
its
uneasy
and
unconscious
determination
currie
my
old
tutor
at
hackney
may
still
have
the
rough
draught
of
this
speculation
which
i
gave
him
with
tears
in
my
eyes
and
which
he
accepted
in
lieu
of
the
customary
and
as
a
proof
that
i
was
no
idler
but
that
my
inability
to
produce
a
line
on
the
ordinary
school
topics
arose
from
my
being
involved
in
more
difficult
and
abstruse
matters
he
must
smile
at
the
so
charge
against
me
of
florid
flippancy
and
tinsel
if
from
those
briars
i
have
since
plucked
roses
what
labour
has
it
not
cost
me
the
test
and
corporation
acts
were
repealed
the
other
day
how
would
my
father
have
rejoiced
if
this
had
happened
in
his
time
and
in
concert
with
his
old
friends
price
priestly
and
others
but
now
that
there
is
no
one
to
care
about
it
they
give
as
a
boon
to
indifference
what
they
so
long
refused
to
justice
and
thus
ascribed
by
some
to
the
liberality
of
the
age
spirit
of
contradiction
when
wilt
thou
cease
to
rule
over
sublunary
affairs
as
the
moon
governs
the
tides
not
till
the
unexpected
stroke
of
a
comet
throws
up
a
new
breed
of
men
and
animals
from
the
bowels
of
the
earth
nor
then
neither
since
it
is
included
in
the
very
idea
of
all
life
power
and
motion
and
are
inseparable
terms
but
not
to
wander
any
farther
from
the
point
i
began
with
trying
to
define
what
a
meant
and
this
i
settled
with
myself
was
not
simply
that
which
is
good
or
useful
in
itself
but
that
which
is
thought
so
by
the
individual
and
which
has
the
sanction
of
his
will
as
such
because
the
determining
what
is
good
in
itself
is
an
endless
question
because
one
person
having
a
right
to
any
good
and
another
being
made
the
judge
of
it
leaves
him
without
any
security
for
its
being
exercised
to
his
advantage
whereas
is
a
natural
guarantee
for
our
a
thing
being
willed
is
the
most
absolute
moral
reason
for
its
existence
that
a
thing
is
good
in
itself
is
no
reason
whatever
why
it
should
exist
till
the
will
clothes
it
with
a
power
to
act
as
a
motive
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
to
prevent
this
will
from
taking
effect
no
law
or
admitted
plea
above
it
but
another
will
opposed
to
it
and
which
forms
a
right
on
the
same
principle
a
good
is
only
so
far
a
right
inasmuch
as
it
virtually
determines
the
will
for
a
meant
that
which
contains
within
itself
and
as
respects
the
bosom
in
which
it
is
lodged
a
cogent
and
unanswerable
reason
why
it
should
exist
suppose
i
have
a
violent
aversion
to
one
thing
and
as
strong
an
attachment
to
something
else
and
that
there
is
no
other
being
in
the
world
but
myself
shall
i
not
have
a
right
full
title
liberty
to
pursue
the
one
and
avoid
the
other
that
is
to
say
in
other
words
there
can
be
no
authority
to
interpose
between
the
strong
natural
tendency
of
the
will
and
its
desired
effect
but
the
will
of
another
it
may
be
replied
that
reason
that
affection
may
interpose
between
the
will
and
the
act
but
there
are
motives
that
influence
the
conduct
by
first
altering
the
will
and
the
point
at
issue
is
that
these
being
away
what
other
principle
or
lever
is
there
always
left
to
appeal
to
before
we
come
to
blows
now
such
a
principle
is
to
be
found
in
and
such
a
barrier
against
the
violent
will
is
erected
by
the
limits
which
this
principle
necessarily
sets
to
itself
in
the
claims
of
different
individuals
thus
then
a
right
is
not
that
which
is
right
in
itself
or
best
for
the
whole
or
even
for
the
individual
but
that
which
is
good
in
his
own
eyes
and
according
to
his
own
will
and
to
which
among
a
number
of
equally
selfish
and
beings
he
can
lay
claim
allowing
the
same
latitude
and
allowance
to
others
political
justice
is
that
which
assigns
the
limits
of
these
individual
rights
in
society
or
it
is
the
adjustment
of
force
against
force
of
will
against
will
to
prevent
worse
consequences
in
the
savage
state
there
is
nothing
but
an
appeal
to
brute
force
or
the
right
of
the
strongest
politics
lays
down
a
rule
to
curb
and
measure
out
the
wills
of
individuals
in
equal
portions
morals
has
a
higher
standard
still
and
ought
never
to
appeal
to
force
in
any
case
whatever
hence
i
always
found
something
wanting
in
godwin
concerning
political
which
i
read
soon
after
with
great
avidity
and
hoped
from
its
title
and
its
vast
reputation
to
get
entire
satisfaction
from
it
for
he
makes
no
distinction
between
political
justice
which
implies
an
appeal
to
force
and
moral
justice
which
implies
only
an
appeal
to
reason
it
is
surely
a
distinct
question
what
you
can
persuade
people
to
do
by
argument
and
fair
discussion
and
what
you
may
lawfully
compel
them
to
do
when
reason
and
remonstrance
fail
but
in
godwin
system
the
of
reason
supersedes
the
use
of
law
and
government
merges
the
imperfection
of
the
means
in
the
grandeur
of
the
end
and
leaves
but
one
class
of
ideas
or
motives
the
highest
and
the
least
attainable
possible
so
promises
and
oaths
are
said
to
be
of
no
more
value
than
common
breath
nor
would
they
if
every
word
we
uttered
was
infallible
and
oracular
as
if
delivered
from
a
tripod
but
this
is
pragmatical
and
putting
an
imaginary
for
a
real
state
of
things
again
right
and
duties
according
to
godwin
are
reciprocal
i
could
not
comprehend
this
without
an
arbitrary
definition
that
took
away
the
meaning
in
my
sense
a
man
might
have
a
right
a
discriminating
power
to
do
something
which
others
could
not
deprive
him
of
without
a
manifest
infraction
of
certain
rules
laid
down
for
the
peace
and
order
of
society
but
which
it
might
be
his
duty
to
waive
upon
good
reasons
shown
rights
are
seconded
by
force
duties
are
things
of
choice
this
is
the
import
of
the
words
in
common
speech
why
then
pass
over
this
distinction
in
a
work
confessedly
rhetorical
as
well
as
logical
that
is
which
laid
an
equal
stress
on
sound
and
sense
right
therefore
has
a
personal
or
selfish
reference
as
it
is
founded
on
the
law
which
determines
a
actions
in
regard
to
his
own
being
and
and
political
justice
is
that
which
assigns
the
limits
of
these
individual
rights
on
their
compatibility
or
incompatibility
with
each
other
in
society
right
in
a
word
is
the
duty
which
each
man
owes
to
himself
or
it
is
that
portion
of
the
general
good
of
which
as
being
principally
interested
he
is
made
the
special
judge
and
which
is
put
under
his
immediate
keeping
the
next
question
i
asked
myself
was
what
is
law
and
the
real
and
necessary
ground
of
civil
government
the
answer
to
this
is
found
in
the
former
statement
is
something
to
abridge
or
more
properly
speaking
to
ascertain
the
bounds
of
the
original
right
and
to
coerce
the
will
of
individuals
in
the
community
whence
then
has
the
community
such
a
right
it
can
only
arise
in
or
from
the
necessity
of
maintaining
the
equal
rights
of
every
one
and
of
opposing
force
to
force
in
case
of
any
violent
and
unwarrantable
infringement
of
them
society
consists
of
a
given
number
of
individuals
and
the
aggregate
right
of
government
is
only
the
consequence
of
these
inherent
rights
balancing
and
neutralising
one
another
how
those
who
deny
natural
rights
get
at
any
sort
of
right
divine
or
human
i
am
at
a
loss
to
discover
for
whatever
exists
in
combination
exists
beforehand
in
an
elementary
state
the
world
is
composed
of
atoms
and
a
machine
can
not
be
made
without
materials
first
then
it
follows
that
law
or
government
is
not
the
mere
creature
of
a
social
compact
since
each
person
has
a
certain
right
which
he
is
bound
to
defend
against
another
without
asking
that
other
leave
or
else
the
right
would
always
be
at
the
mercy
of
whoever
chose
to
invade
it
there
would
be
a
right
to
do
wrong
but
none
to
resist
it
thus
i
have
a
natural
right
to
defend
my
life
against
a
murderer
without
any
mutual
compact
between
us
hence
society
has
an
aggregate
right
of
the
same
kind
and
to
make
a
law
to
that
effect
forbidding
and
punishing
murder
if
there
be
no
such
immediate
value
and
attachment
to
life
felt
by
the
individual
and
a
consequent
justifiable
determination
to
defend
it
then
the
formal
pretension
of
society
to
vindicate
a
right
which
according
to
this
reasoning
has
no
existence
in
itself
must
be
founded
on
air
on
a
word
or
a
lawyer
secondly
society
or
government
as
such
has
no
right
to
trench
upon
the
liberty
or
rights
of
the
individuals
its
members
except
as
these
last
are
as
it
were
forfeited
by
interfering
with
and
destroying
one
another
like
opposite
mechanical
forces
or
quantities
in
arithmetic
put
the
basis
that
each
man
will
is
a
sovereign
law
to
itself
this
can
only
hold
in
society
as
long
as
he
does
not
meddle
with
others
but
so
long
as
he
does
not
do
this
the
first
principle
retains
its
force
for
there
is
no
other
principle
to
impeach
or
overrule
it
the
will
of
society
is
not
a
sufficient
plea
since
this
is
or
ought
to
be
made
up
of
the
wills
or
rights
of
the
individuals
composing
it
which
by
the
supposition
remain
entire
and
consequently
without
power
to
act
the
good
of
society
is
not
a
sufficient
plea
for
individuals
are
only
bound
on
compulsion
not
to
do
it
harm
or
to
be
barely
just
benevolence
and
virtue
are
voluntary
qualities
for
instance
if
two
persons
are
obliged
to
do
all
that
is
possible
for
the
good
of
both
this
must
either
be
settled
voluntarily
between
them
and
then
it
is
friendship
and
not
force
or
if
this
is
not
the
case
it
is
plain
that
one
must
be
the
slave
and
lie
at
the
caprice
and
mercy
of
the
other
it
will
be
one
will
forcibly
regulating
two
bodies
but
if
each
is
left
master
of
his
own
person
and
actions
with
only
the
implied
proviso
of
not
encroaching
on
those
of
the
other
then
both
may
continue
free
and
independent
and
contented
in
their
several
spheres
one
individual
has
no
right
to
interfere
with
the
employment
of
my
muscular
powers
or
to
put
violence
on
my
person
to
force
me
to
contribute
to
the
most
laudable
undertaking
if
i
do
not
approve
of
it
any
more
than
i
have
to
force
him
to
assist
me
in
the
direct
contrary
if
one
has
not
ten
have
not
nor
a
million
any
such
arbitrary
right
over
me
what
one
can
be
to
do
for
a
million
is
very
trifling
what
a
million
may
do
by
being
left
free
in
all
that
merely
concerns
themselves
and
not
subject
to
the
perpetual
caprice
and
insolence
of
authority
and
pretext
of
the
public
good
is
a
very
different
calculation
by
giving
up
the
principle
of
political
independence
it
is
not
the
million
that
will
govern
the
one
but
the
one
that
will
in
time
give
law
to
the
million
there
are
some
things
that
can
not
be
free
in
natural
society
and
against
which
there
is
a
natural
law
for
instance
no
one
can
be
allowed
to
knock
out
another
brains
or
to
fetter
his
limbs
with
impunity
and
government
is
bound
to
prevent
the
same
violations
of
liberty
and
justice
the
question
is
whether
it
would
not
be
possible
for
a
government
to
exist
and
for
a
system
of
laws
to
be
framed
that
confined
itself
to
the
punishment
of
such
offences
and
left
all
the
rest
except
the
suppression
of
force
by
force
optional
or
matter
of
mutual
compact
what
are
a
man
natural
rights
those
the
infringement
of
which
can
not
on
any
supposition
go
unpunished
by
leaving
all
but
cases
of
necessity
to
choice
and
reason
much
would
be
perhaps
gained
and
nothing
lost
corollary
it
results
from
the
foregoing
statement
that
there
is
nothing
naturally
to
restrain
or
oppose
the
will
of
one
man
but
the
will
of
another
meeting
it
thus
in
a
desert
island
it
is
evident
that
my
will
and
rights
would
be
absolute
and
unlimited
and
i
might
say
with
robinson
crusoe
am
monarch
of
all
i
survey
corollary
it
is
coming
into
society
that
circumscribes
my
will
and
rights
by
establishing
equal
and
mutual
rights
instead
of
the
original
uncircumscribed
ones
they
are
still
as
the
rock
though
not
so
broad
and
general
as
the
casing
air
for
the
only
thing
that
limits
them
is
the
solidity
of
another
right
no
better
than
my
own
and
like
stones
in
a
building
or
a
mosaic
pavement
each
remains
not
the
less
firmly
riveted
to
its
place
though
it
can
not
encroach
upon
the
next
to
it
i
do
not
belong
to
the
state
nor
am
i
a
nonentity
in
it
but
i
am
one
part
of
it
and
independent
in
it
for
that
very
reason
that
every
one
in
it
is
independent
of
me
equality
instead
of
being
destroyed
by
society
results
from
and
is
improved
by
it
for
in
politics
as
in
physics
the
action
and
reaction
are
the
same
the
right
of
resistance
on
their
part
implies
the
right
of
on
mine
in
a
theatre
each
person
has
a
right
to
his
own
seat
by
the
supposition
that
he
has
no
right
to
intrude
into
any
one
else
they
are
convertible
propositions
away
then
with
the
notion
that
liberty
and
equality
are
inconsistent
but
here
is
the
artifice
by
merging
the
rights
and
independence
of
the
individual
in
the
fictitious
order
of
society
those
rights
become
arbitrary
capricious
equivocal
removable
at
the
pleasure
of
the
state
or
ruling
power
there
is
nothing
substantial
or
durable
implied
in
them
if
each
has
no
positive
claim
naturally
those
of
all
taken
together
can
mount
up
to
nothing
right
and
justice
are
mere
blanks
to
be
filled
up
with
arbitrary
will
and
the
people
have
thenceforward
no
defence
against
the
government
on
the
other
hand
suppose
these
rights
to
be
not
empty
names
or
artificial
arrangements
but
original
and
inherent
like
solid
atoms
then
it
is
not
in
the
power
of
government
to
annihilate
one
of
them
whatever
may
be
the
confusion
arising
from
their
struggle
for
mastery
or
before
they
can
settle
into
order
and
harmony
burke
talks
of
the
reflections
and
refractions
of
the
rays
of
light
as
altering
their
primary
essence
and
direction
but
if
there
were
no
original
rays
of
light
there
could
be
neither
refraction
nor
reflections
why
then
does
he
try
by
cloudy
sophistry
to
blot
the
sun
out
of
heaven
one
body
impinges
against
and
impedes
another
in
the
fall
but
it
could
not
do
this
but
for
the
principle
of
gravity
the
author
of
the
and
would
have
a
single
atom
outweigh
the
great
globe
itself
or
all
empty
title
a
bloated
privilege
or
a
grievous
wrong
overturn
the
entire
mass
of
truth
and
justice
the
question
between
the
author
and
his
opponents
appears
to
be
simply
this
whether
politics
or
the
general
good
is
all
affair
of
reason
or
imagination
and
this
seems
decided
by
another
consideration
viz
that
imagination
is
the
judge
of
individual
things
and
reason
of
generals
hence
the
great
importance
of
the
principle
of
universal
suffrage
for
if
the
vote
and
choice
of
a
single
individual
goes
for
nothing
so
by
parity
of
reasoning
may
that
of
all
the
rest
of
the
community
but
if
the
choice
of
every
man
in
the
community
is
held
sacred
then
what
must
be
the
weight
and
value
of
the
whole
many
persons
object
that
by
this
means
property
is
not
represented
and
so
to
avoid
that
they
would
have
nothing
but
property
represented
at
the
same
time
that
they
pretend
that
if
the
elective
franchise
were
thrown
open
to
the
poor
they
would
be
wholly
at
the
command
of
the
rich
to
the
prejudice
and
exclusion
of
the
middle
and
independent
classes
of
society
property
always
has
a
natural
influence
and
authority
it
is
only
people
without
property
that
have
no
natural
protection
and
require
every
artificial
and
legal
one
that
have
much
shall
have
more
and
those
that
have
little
shall
have
this
proverb
is
no
less
true
in
public
than
in
private
life
the
as
they
are
called
and
who
in
virtue
of
this
title
would
assume
a
monopoly
in
the
direction
of
state
affairs
are
merely
and
in
plain
english
those
who
are
than
others
and
as
they
get
the
monopoly
into
their
hands
others
will
uniformly
be
and
will
sink
lower
and
lower
in
the
scale
so
that
it
is
essentially
requisite
to
extend
the
elective
franchise
in
order
to
counteract
the
excess
of
the
great
and
increasing
goodness
of
the
better
orders
to
themselves
i
see
no
reason
to
suppose
that
in
any
case
popular
feeling
if
free
course
were
given
to
it
would
bear
down
public
opinion
literature
is
at
present
pretty
nearly
on
the
footing
of
universal
suffrage
yet
the
public
defer
sufficiently
to
the
critics
and
when
no
party
bias
interferes
and
the
government
do
not
make
a
point
of
running
a
writer
down
the
verdict
is
tolerably
fair
and
just
i
do
not
say
that
the
result
might
not
be
equally
satisfactory
when
literature
was
patronised
more
immediately
by
the
great
but
then
lords
and
ladies
had
no
interest
in
praising
a
bad
piece
and
condemning
a
good
one
if
they
could
have
laid
a
tax
on
the
town
for
not
going
to
it
they
would
have
run
a
bad
play
forty
nights
together
or
the
whole
year
round
without
scruple
as
things
stand
the
worse
the
law
the
better
for
the
lawmakers
it
takes
everything
from
others
to
give
to
it
is
common
to
insist
on
universal
suffrage
and
the
ballot
together
but
if
the
first
were
allowed
the
second
would
be
unnecessary
the
ballot
is
only
useful
as
a
screen
from
arbitrary
power
there
is
nothing
manly
or
independent
to
recommend
it
corollary
if
i
was
out
at
sea
in
a
boat
with
a
monarch
and
he
wanted
to
throw
me
overboard
i
would
not
let
him
no
gentleman
would
ask
such
a
thing
no
freeman
would
submit
to
it
has
he
then
a
right
to
dispose
of
the
lives
and
liberties
of
thirty
millions
of
men
or
have
they
more
right
than
i
have
to
resist
his
demands
they
have
thirty
millions
of
times
that
right
if
they
had
a
particle
of
the
same
spirit
that
i
have
it
is
not
the
individual
then
whom
in
this
case
i
fear
to
me
divinity
doth
hedge
a
king
but
thirty
millions
of
his
subjects
that
call
me
to
account
in
his
name
and
who
are
of
a
most
approved
and
indisputable
loyalty
and
who
have
both
the
right
and
power
the
power
rests
with
the
multitude
but
let
them
beware
how
the
exercise
of
it
turns
against
their
own
rights
it
is
not
the
idol
but
the
worshippers
that
are
to
be
dreaded
and
who
by
degrading
one
of
their
fellows
render
themselves
liable
to
be
branded
with
the
same
indignities
corollary
no
one
can
be
born
a
slave
for
my
limbs
are
my
own
and
the
power
and
the
will
to
use
them
are
anterior
to
all
laws
and
independent
of
the
control
of
every
other
person
no
one
acquires
a
right
over
another
but
that
other
acquires
some
reciprocal
right
over
him
therefore
the
relation
of
master
and
slave
is
a
contradiction
in
political
logic
hence
also
it
follows
that
combinations
among
labourers
for
the
rise
of
wages
are
always
just
and
lawful
as
much
as
those
among
master
manufacturers
to
keep
them
down
a
man
labour
is
his
own
at
least
as
much
as
another
goods
and
he
may
starve
if
he
pleases
but
he
may
refuse
to
work
except
on
his
own
terms
the
right
of
property
is
reducible
to
this
simple
principle
that
one
man
has
not
a
right
to
the
produce
of
another
labour
but
each
man
has
a
right
to
the
benefit
of
his
own
exertions
and
the
use
of
his
natural
and
inalienable
powers
unless
for
a
supposed
equivalent
and
by
mutual
consent
personal
liberty
and
property
therefore
rest
upon
the
same
foundation
i
am
glad
to
see
that
macculloch
in
his
on
admits
the
right
of
combination
among
journeymen
and
others
i
laboured
this
point
hard
and
i
think
satisfactorily
a
good
while
ago
in
my
to
your
bread
upon
the
waters
and
after
many
days
you
shall
find
it
again
there
are
four
things
that
a
man
may
especially
call
his
own
his
person
his
actions
his
property
his
opinions
let
us
see
how
each
of
these
claims
unavoidably
circumscribes
and
modifies
those
of
others
on
the
principle
of
abstract
equity
and
necessity
and
independence
above
laid
down
first
as
to
the
rights
of
persons
my
intention
is
to
show
that
the
right
of
society
to
make
laws
to
coerce
the
will
of
others
is
founded
on
the
necessity
of
repelling
the
wanton
encroachment
of
that
will
on
their
rights
that
is
strictly
on
the
right
of
or
resistance
to
aggression
society
comes
forward
and
says
us
alone
and
we
will
let
you
alone
otherwise
we
must
see
which
is
strongest
its
object
is
not
to
patronise
or
advise
individuals
for
their
good
and
against
their
will
but
to
protect
itself
meddling
with
others
forcibly
on
any
other
plea
or
for
any
other
purpose
is
impertinence
but
equal
rights
destroy
one
another
nor
can
there
be
a
right
to
impossible
or
impracticable
things
let
a
b
c
d
be
different
component
parts
of
any
society
each
claiming
to
be
the
centre
and
master
of
a
certain
sphere
of
activity
and
as
long
as
each
keeps
within
his
own
line
of
demarcation
there
is
no
harm
done
nor
any
penalty
incurred
it
is
only
the
superfluous
and
overbearing
will
of
particular
persons
that
must
be
restrained
or
lopped
off
by
the
axe
of
the
law
let
a
be
the
culprit
b
c
d
or
the
rest
of
the
community
are
plaintiffs
against
a
and
wish
to
prevent
his
taking
any
unfair
or
unwarranted
advantage
over
them
they
set
up
no
pretence
to
dictate
or
domineer
over
him
but
merely
to
hinder
his
dictating
to
and
domineering
over
them
and
in
this
having
both
might
and
right
on
their
side
they
have
no
difficulty
in
putting
it
in
execution
every
independence
and
discretionary
power
over
what
peculiarly
and
exclusively
concerns
himself
is
his
whether
round
square
or
according
to
owen
new
map
of
improvements
in
the
form
of
a
parallelogram
as
long
as
he
keeps
within
this
he
is
safe
society
has
no
hold
of
him
it
is
when
he
quits
it
to
attack
his
neighbours
that
they
resort
to
reprisals
and
make
short
work
of
the
interloper
it
is
however
time
to
endeavour
to
point
out
in
what
this
natural
division
of
right
and
separate
advantage
consists
in
the
first
place
a
b
c
d
have
the
common
and
natural
rights
of
persons
in
so
far
that
none
of
these
has
a
right
to
offer
violence
to
or
cause
bodily
pain
or
injury
to
any
of
the
others
sophists
laugh
at
natural
rights
they
might
as
well
deny
that
we
have
natural
persons
for
while
the
last
distinction
holds
true
and
good
by
the
constitution
of
things
certain
consequences
must
and
will
follow
from
it
this
machine
is
to
us
hamlet
etc
for
instance
i
should
like
to
know
whether
burke
with
his
and
fancies
would
deny
that
each
person
has
a
particular
body
and
senses
belonging
to
him
so
that
he
feels
a
peculiar
and
natural
interest
in
whatever
affects
these
more
than
another
can
and
whether
such
a
peculiar
and
paramount
interest
does
not
imply
a
direct
and
unavoidable
right
in
maintaining
this
circle
of
individuality
inviolate
to
argue
otherwise
is
to
assert
that
indifference
or
that
which
does
not
feel
either
the
good
or
the
ill
is
as
capable
a
judge
and
zealous
a
discriminator
of
right
and
wrong
as
that
which
does
the
right
then
is
coeval
and
with
the
interest
not
a
product
of
convention
but
inseparable
from
the
order
of
the
universe
the
doctrine
itself
is
natural
and
solid
it
is
the
contrary
fallacy
that
is
made
of
air
and
words
burke
in
such
a
question
was
like
a
man
out
at
sea
in
a
haze
and
could
never
tell
the
difference
between
land
and
clouds
if
another
break
my
arm
by
violence
this
will
not
certainly
give
him
additional
health
or
strength
if
he
stun
me
by
a
blow
or
inflict
torture
on
my
limbs
it
is
i
who
feel
the
pain
and
not
he
and
it
is
hard
if
i
who
am
the
sufferer
am
not
allowed
to
be
the
judge
that
another
should
pretend
to
deprive
me
of
it
or
pretend
to
judge
for
me
and
set
up
his
will
against
mine
in
what
concerns
this
portion
of
my
existence
where
i
have
all
at
stake
and
he
nothing
is
not
merely
injustice
but
impudence
the
circle
of
personal
security
and
right
then
is
not
an
imaginary
and
arbitrary
line
fixed
by
law
and
the
will
of
the
prince
or
the
scaly
finger
of
hobbes
but
is
real
and
inherent
in
the
nature
of
things
and
itself
the
foundation
of
law
and
justice
off
is
fair
play
according
to
the
old
adage
one
therefore
has
not
a
right
to
lay
violent
hands
on
another
or
to
infringe
on
the
sphere
of
his
personal
identity
one
must
not
run
foul
of
another
or
he
is
liable
to
be
repelled
and
punished
for
the
offence
if
you
meet
an
englishman
suddenly
in
the
street
he
will
run
up
against
you
sooner
than
get
out
of
your
way
which
last
he
thinks
a
compromise
of
his
dignity
and
a
relinquishment
of
his
purpose
though
he
expects
you
to
get
out
of
his
a
frenchman
in
the
same
circumstances
will
come
up
close
to
you
and
try
to
walk
over
you
as
if
there
was
no
one
in
his
way
but
if
you
take
no
notice
of
him
he
will
step
on
one
side
and
make
you
a
low
bow
the
one
is
a
fellow
of
stubborn
will
the
other
a
an
englishman
at
a
play
mounts
upon
a
bench
and
refuses
to
get
down
at
the
request
of
another
who
threatens
to
call
him
to
account
the
next
day
is
the
answer
of
the
first
your
master
will
let
you
his
abuse
of
liberty
he
thinks
is
justified
by
the
other
want
of
it
all
an
englishman
ideas
are
modifications
of
his
will
which
shows
in
one
way
that
right
is
founded
on
will
since
the
english
are
at
once
the
freest
and
most
wilful
of
all
people
if
you
meet
another
on
the
ridge
of
a
precipice
are
you
to
throw
each
other
down
certainly
not
you
are
to
pass
as
well
as
you
can
and
take
is
the
rule
of
natural
right
where
the
right
is
not
all
on
one
side
and
can
not
be
claimed
entire
equal
weights
and
scales
produce
a
balance
as
much
as
where
the
scales
are
empty
so
it
does
not
follow
as
our
votaries
of
absolute
power
would
insinuate
that
one
man
right
is
nothing
because
another
is
something
but
suppose
there
is
not
time
to
pass
and
one
or
other
must
perish
in
the
case
just
mentioned
then
each
must
do
the
best
for
himself
that
he
can
and
the
instinct
of
prevails
over
everything
else
in
the
streets
of
london
the
passengers
take
the
right
hand
of
one
another
and
the
wall
alternately
he
who
should
not
conform
to
this
rule
would
be
guilty
of
a
breach
of
the
peace
but
if
a
house
were
falling
or
a
mad
ox
driven
furiously
by
the
rule
would
be
of
course
suspended
because
the
case
would
be
out
of
the
ordinary
yet
i
think
i
can
conceive
and
have
even
known
persons
capable
of
carrying
the
point
of
gallantry
in
political
right
to
such
a
pitch
as
to
refuse
to
take
a
precedence
which
did
not
belong
to
them
in
the
most
perilous
circumstances
just
as
a
soldier
may
waive
a
right
to
quit
his
post
and
takes
his
turn
in
battle
the
actual
collision
or
case
of
personal
assault
and
battery
is
then
clearly
prohibited
inasmuch
as
each
person
body
is
clearly
defined
but
how
if
a
use
other
means
of
annoyance
against
b
such
as
a
sword
or
poison
or
resort
to
what
causes
other
painful
sensations
besides
tangible
ones
for
instance
certain
disagreeable
sounds
and
smells
or
if
these
are
included
as
a
violation
of
personal
rights
then
how
draw
the
line
between
them
and
the
employing
certain
offensive
words
and
gestures
or
uttering
opinions
which
i
disapprove
this
is
a
puzzler
for
the
dogmatic
school
but
they
solve
the
whole
difficulty
by
an
assumption
of
which
is
as
much
as
to
tell
a
person
that
the
way
to
any
place
to
which
he
asks
a
direction
is
follow
his
nose
we
want
to
know
by
given
marks
and
rules
what
is
best
and
useful
and
they
assure
us
very
wisely
that
this
is
infallibly
and
clearly
determined
by
what
is
best
and
useful
let
us
try
something
else
it
seems
no
less
necessary
to
erect
certain
little
with
palisades
and
outworks
about
them
for
right
to
establish
and
maintain
itself
in
than
as
landmarks
to
guide
us
across
the
wide
waste
of
utility
if
a
person
runs
a
sword
through
me
or
administers
poison
or
procures
it
to
be
administered
the
effect
the
pain
disease
or
death
is
the
same
and
i
have
the
same
right
to
prevent
it
on
the
principle
that
i
am
the
sufferer
that
the
injury
is
offered
to
me
and
he
is
no
gainer
by
it
except
for
mere
malice
or
caprice
and
i
therefore
remain
master
and
judge
of
my
own
remedy
as
in
the
former
case
the
principle
and
definition
of
right
being
to
secure
to
each
individual
the
determination
and
protection
of
that
portion
of
sensation
in
which
he
has
the
greatest
if
not
a
sole
interest
and
as
it
were
identity
with
it
again
as
to
what
are
called
to
wit
offensive
smells
sounds
it
is
more
difficult
to
determine
on
the
ground
that
man
meat
is
another
man
i
remember
a
case
occurred
in
the
neighbourhood
where
i
was
and
at
the
time
i
was
trying
my
best
at
this
question
which
puzzled
me
a
good
deal
a
rector
of
a
little
town
in
shropshire
who
was
at
variance
with
all
his
parishioners
had
conceived
a
particular
spite
to
a
lawyer
who
lived
next
door
to
him
and
as
a
means
of
annoying
him
used
to
get
together
all
sorts
of
rubbish
weeds
and
unsavoury
materials
and
set
them
on
fire
so
that
the
smoke
should
blow
over
into
his
neighbour
garden
whenever
the
wind
set
in
that
direction
he
said
as
a
signal
to
his
gardener
a
fine
wicksteed
wind
and
the
operation
commenced
was
this
an
action
of
assault
and
battery
or
not
i
think
it
was
for
this
reason
that
the
offence
was
unequivocal
and
that
the
only
motive
for
the
proceeding
was
the
giving
this
offence
the
assailant
would
not
like
to
be
served
so
himself
bentham
would
say
the
malice
of
the
motive
was
a
to
the
injury
i
shall
leave
that
consideration
out
of
the
question
a
man
who
knocks
out
brains
with
a
bludgeon
may
say
it
pleases
him
to
do
so
but
will
it
please
him
to
have
the
compliment
returned
if
he
still
persists
in
spite
of
this
punishment
there
is
no
preventing
him
but
if
not
then
it
is
a
proof
that
he
thinks
the
pleasure
less
than
the
pain
to
himself
and
consequently
to
another
in
the
scales
of
justice
the
is
an
excellent
test
suppose
a
third
person
the
physician
of
the
place
had
said
is
a
fine
egerton
wind
our
rector
would
have
been
for
he
would
have
found
that
as
he
suffered
all
the
hardship
he
had
the
right
to
complain
of
and
to
resist
an
action
of
another
the
consequences
of
which
affected
principally
himself
now
mark
if
he
had
himself
had
any
advantage
to
derive
from
the
action
which
he
could
not
obtain
in
any
other
way
then
he
would
feel
that
his
neighbour
also
had
the
same
plea
and
right
to
follow
his
own
course
still
this
might
be
a
doubtful
point
but
in
the
other
case
it
would
be
sheer
malice
and
wanton
interference
that
is
not
the
exercise
of
a
right
but
the
invasion
of
another
comfort
and
independence
has
a
person
then
a
right
to
play
on
the
horn
or
on
a
flute
on
the
same
staircase
i
say
yes
because
it
is
for
his
own
improvement
and
pleasure
and
not
to
annoy
another
and
because
accordingly
every
one
in
his
own
case
would
wish
to
reserve
this
or
a
similar
privilege
to
himself
i
do
not
think
a
person
has
a
right
to
beat
a
drum
under
one
window
because
this
is
altogether
disagreeable
and
if
there
is
an
extraordinary
motive
for
it
then
it
is
fit
that
the
person
should
be
put
to
some
little
inconvenience
in
removing
his
sphere
of
liberty
of
action
to
a
reasonable
distance
a
shop
or
a
is
a
nuisance
in
a
town
and
ought
to
be
removed
into
the
suburbs
but
they
are
to
be
tolerated
where
they
are
least
inconvenient
because
they
are
necessary
somewhere
and
there
is
no
remedying
the
inconvenience
the
right
to
protest
against
and
to
prohibit
them
rests
with
the
suffering
party
but
because
this
point
of
the
greatest
interest
is
less
clear
in
some
cases
than
in
others
it
does
not
follow
that
there
is
no
right
or
principle
of
justice
in
the
case
as
to
matters
of
contempt
and
the
expression
of
opinion
i
think
these
do
not
fall
under
the
head
of
force
and
are
not
on
that
ground
subjects
of
coercion
and
law
for
example
if
a
person
inflicts
a
sensation
upon
me
by
material
means
whether
tangible
or
otherwise
i
can
not
help
that
sensation
i
am
so
far
the
slave
of
that
other
and
have
no
means
of
resisting
him
but
by
force
which
i
would
define
to
be
material
agency
but
if
another
proposes
an
opinion
to
me
i
am
not
bound
to
be
of
this
opinion
my
judgment
and
will
is
left
free
and
therefore
i
have
no
right
to
resort
to
force
to
recover
a
liberty
which
i
have
not
lost
if
i
do
this
to
prevent
that
other
from
pressing
that
opinion
it
is
i
who
invade
his
liberty
without
warrant
because
without
necessity
it
may
be
urged
that
material
agency
or
force
is
used
in
the
adoption
of
sounds
or
letters
of
the
alphabet
which
i
can
not
help
seeing
or
hearing
but
the
injury
is
not
here
but
in
the
moral
and
artificial
inference
which
i
am
at
liberty
to
admit
or
reject
according
to
the
evidence
there
is
no
force
but
argument
in
the
case
and
it
is
reason
not
the
will
of
another
that
gives
the
law
further
the
opinion
expressed
generally
concerns
not
one
individual
but
the
general
interest
and
of
that
my
approbation
or
disapprobation
is
not
a
commensurate
or
the
sole
judge
i
am
judge
of
my
own
interests
because
it
is
my
affair
and
no
one
else
but
by
the
same
rule
i
am
not
judge
nor
have
i
a
on
that
which
appeals
to
all
the
world
merely
because
i
have
a
prejudice
or
fancy
against
it
but
suppose
another
expresses
by
signs
or
words
a
contempt
for
me
i
do
not
know
that
he
is
bound
to
have
a
respect
for
me
opinion
is
free
for
if
i
wish
him
to
have
that
respect
then
he
must
be
left
free
to
judge
for
himself
and
consequently
to
arrive
at
and
to
express
the
contrary
opinion
or
otherwise
the
verdict
and
testimony
i
aim
at
could
not
be
obtained
just
as
players
must
consent
to
be
hissed
if
they
expect
to
be
applauded
opinion
can
not
be
forced
for
it
is
not
grounded
on
force
but
on
evidence
and
reason
and
therefore
these
last
are
the
proper
instruments
to
control
that
opinion
and
to
make
it
favourable
to
what
we
wish
or
hostile
to
what
we
disapprove
in
what
relates
to
action
the
will
of
another
is
force
or
the
determining
power
in
what
relates
to
opinion
the
mere
will
or
of
another
is
of
no
avail
but
as
it
gains
over
other
opinions
to
its
side
and
therefore
neither
needs
nor
admits
of
force
as
a
counteracting
means
to
be
used
against
it
but
in
the
case
of
calumny
or
indecency
i
would
say
that
it
is
the
suppression
of
truth
that
gives
falsehood
its
worst
edge
what
transpires
however
maliciously
or
secretly
in
spite
of
the
law
is
taken
for
gospel
and
as
it
is
impossible
to
prevent
calumny
so
it
is
impossible
to
counteract
it
on
the
present
system
or
while
every
attempt
to
answer
it
is
attributed
to
the
not
daring
to
speak
the
truth
if
any
single
fact
or
accident
peeps
out
the
whole
character
having
this
legal
screen
before
it
is
supposed
to
be
of
a
piece
and
the
world
defrauded
of
the
means
of
coming
to
their
own
conclusion
naturally
infer
the
worst
hence
the
saying
that
reputation
once
gone
never
returns
if
however
we
grant
the
general
licence
or
liberty
of
the
press
in
a
scheme
where
publicity
is
the
great
object
it
seems
a
manifest
that
the
author
should
be
the
only
thing
screened
or
kept
a
secret
either
therefore
an
anonymous
libeller
would
be
heard
with
contempt
or
if
he
signed
his
name
thus
or
thus
it
would
be
equivalent
to
being
branded
publicly
as
a
calumniator
or
marked
with
the
or
the
broad
rogue
on
his
back
these
are
thought
sufficient
punishments
and
yet
they
rest
on
opinion
without
stripes
or
labour
as
to
indecency
in
proportion
as
it
is
flagrant
is
the
shock
and
resentment
against
it
and
as
vanity
is
the
source
of
indecency
so
the
universal
discountenance
and
shame
is
its
most
effectual
antidote
if
it
is
public
it
produces
immediate
reprisals
from
public
opinion
which
no
brow
can
stand
and
if
secret
it
had
better
be
left
so
no
one
can
then
say
it
is
obtruded
on
him
and
if
he
will
go
in
search
of
it
it
seems
odd
he
should
call
upon
the
law
to
frustrate
the
object
of
his
pursuit
further
at
the
worst
society
has
its
remedy
in
its
own
hands
whenever
its
moral
sense
is
outraged
that
is
it
may
send
to
coventry
or
excommunicate
like
the
church
of
old
for
though
it
may
have
no
right
to
prosecute
it
is
not
bound
to
protect
or
patronise
unless
by
voluntary
consent
of
all
parties
concerned
secondly
as
to
rights
of
action
or
personal
liberty
these
have
no
limit
but
the
rights
of
persons
or
property
aforesaid
or
to
be
hereafter
named
they
are
the
channels
in
which
the
others
run
without
injury
and
without
impediment
as
a
river
within
its
banks
every
one
has
a
right
to
use
his
natural
powers
in
the
way
most
agreeable
to
himself
and
which
he
deems
most
conducive
to
his
own
advantage
provided
he
does
not
interfere
with
the
corresponding
rights
and
liberties
of
others
he
has
no
right
to
coerce
them
by
a
decision
of
his
individual
will
and
as
long
as
he
abstains
from
this
he
has
no
right
to
be
coerced
by
an
expression
of
the
aggregate
will
that
is
by
law
the
law
is
the
emanation
of
the
aggregate
will
and
this
will
receives
its
warrant
to
act
only
from
the
forcible
pressure
from
without
and
its
indispensable
resistance
to
it
let
us
see
how
this
will
operate
to
the
pruning
and
curtailment
of
law
the
rage
of
legislation
is
the
first
vice
of
society
it
ends
by
limiting
it
to
as
few
things
as
possible
there
can
according
to
the
principle
here
imperfectly
sketched
be
no
laws
for
the
enforcement
of
morals
because
morals
have
to
do
with
the
will
and
affections
and
the
law
only
puts
a
restraint
on
these
every
one
is
politically
constituted
the
judge
of
what
is
best
for
himself
it
is
only
when
he
encroaches
on
others
that
he
can
be
called
to
account
he
has
no
right
to
say
to
others
you
shall
do
as
i
do
how
then
should
they
have
a
right
to
say
to
him
you
shall
do
as
we
do
mere
numbers
do
not
convey
the
right
for
the
law
addresses
not
one
but
the
whole
community
for
example
there
can
not
rightly
be
a
law
to
set
a
man
in
the
stocks
for
getting
drunk
it
injures
his
health
you
say
that
is
his
concern
and
not
mine
but
it
is
detrimental
to
his
affairs
if
so
he
suffers
most
by
it
but
it
is
ruinous
to
his
wife
and
family
he
is
their
natural
and
legal
guardian
but
they
are
thrown
upon
the
parish
the
parish
need
not
take
the
burden
upon
itself
unless
it
chooses
or
has
agreed
to
do
so
if
a
man
is
not
kind
to
or
fond
of
his
wife
i
see
no
law
to
make
him
if
he
beats
her
or
threatens
her
life
she
as
clearly
has
a
right
to
call
in
the
aid
of
a
constable
or
justice
of
peace
i
do
not
see
in
like
manner
how
there
can
be
law
against
gambling
against
cheating
there
may
nor
against
usury
a
man
gives
twenty
forty
a
hundred
per
cent
with
his
eyes
open
but
would
he
do
it
if
strong
necessity
did
not
impel
him
certainly
no
man
would
give
double
if
he
could
get
the
same
advantage
for
half
there
are
circumstances
in
which
a
rope
to
save
me
from
drowning
or
a
draught
of
water
would
be
worth
all
i
have
in
like
manner
lotteries
are
fair
things
for
the
loss
is
inconsiderable
and
the
advantage
may
be
incalculable
i
do
not
believe
the
poor
put
into
them
but
the
reduced
rich
the
players
were
formerly
prohibited
as
a
nuisance
and
still
are
liable
to
the
vagrant
act
which
the
parson
of
the
parish
duly
enforces
in
his
zeal
to
prevent
cheating
and
imposture
while
he
himself
has
his
two
livings
and
carries
off
a
tenth
of
the
produce
of
the
soil
rape
is
an
offence
clearly
punishable
by
law
but
i
would
not
say
that
simple
incontinence
is
so
i
will
give
one
more
example
which
though
quaint
may
explain
the
distinction
i
aim
at
a
man
may
commit
suicide
if
he
pleases
without
being
responsible
to
any
one
he
may
quit
the
world
as
he
would
quit
the
country
where
he
was
born
but
if
any
person
were
to
fling
himself
from
the
gallery
into
the
pit
of
a
playhouse
so
as
to
endanger
the
lives
of
others
if
he
did
not
succeed
in
killing
himself
he
would
render
himself
liable
to
punishment
for
the
attempt
if
it
were
to
be
supposed
that
a
person
so
desperately
situated
would
care
about
consequences
duelling
is
lawful
on
the
same
principle
where
every
precaution
is
taken
to
show
that
the
act
is
voluntary
and
fair
on
both
sides
i
might
give
other
instances
but
these
will
suffice
there
should
be
a
perfect
toleration
in
matters
of
religion
in
what
relates
to
the
salvation
of
a
soul
he
is
infinitely
more
concerned
than
i
can
be
and
to
pretend
to
dictate
to
him
in
this
particular
is
an
infinite
piece
of
impertinence
and
presumption
but
if
a
man
has
no
religion
at
all
that
does
not
hinder
me
from
having
any
if
he
stood
at
the
church
door
and
would
not
let
me
enter
i
should
have
a
right
to
push
him
aside
but
if
he
lets
me
pass
by
without
interruption
i
have
no
right
to
turn
back
and
drag
him
in
after
me
he
might
as
well
force
me
to
have
no
religion
as
i
force
him
to
have
one
or
burn
me
at
a
stake
for
believing
what
he
does
not
opinion
the
wild
goose
flies
unclaimed
of
any
man
heaven
is
like
marble
air
accessible
to
all
and
therefore
there
is
no
occasion
to
trip
up
one
another
heels
on
the
road
or
to
erect
a
turnpike
gate
to
collect
large
sums
from
the
passengers
how
have
i
a
right
to
make
another
pay
for
the
saving
of
my
soul
or
to
assist
me
in
damning
his
there
should
be
no
secular
interference
in
sacred
things
no
laws
to
suppress
or
establish
any
church
or
sect
in
religion
no
religious
persecutions
tests
or
disqualifications
the
different
sects
should
be
left
to
inveigh
and
hate
each
other
as
much
as
they
please
but
without
the
love
of
exclusive
domination
and
spiritual
power
there
would
be
little
temptation
to
bigotry
and
intolerance
as
to
the
rights
of
property
it
is
of
no
use
a
man
being
left
to
enjoy
security
or
to
exercise
his
freedom
of
action
unless
he
has
a
right
to
appropriate
certain
other
things
necessary
to
his
comfort
and
subsistence
to
his
own
use
in
a
state
of
nature
or
rather
of
solitary
independence
he
has
a
right
to
all
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
what
then
limits
this
right
its
being
inconsistent
with
the
same
right
in
others
this
strikes
a
mathematical
or
logical
balance
between
two
extreme
and
equal
pretensions
as
there
is
not
a
natural
and
indissoluble
connection
between
the
individual
and
his
property
or
those
outward
objects
of
which
he
may
have
need
they
being
detached
unlimited
and
transferable
as
there
is
between
the
individual
and
his
person
either
as
an
organ
of
sensation
or
action
it
is
necessary
in
order
to
prevent
endless
debate
and
quarrels
to
fix
upon
some
other
criterion
or
common
ground
of
preference
animals
or
savages
have
no
idea
of
any
other
right
than
that
of
the
strongest
and
seize
on
all
they
can
get
by
force
without
any
regard
to
justice
or
an
equal
claim
one
mode
of
settling
the
point
is
to
divide
the
spoil
that
is
allowing
an
equal
advantage
to
both
thus
boys
when
they
unexpectedly
find
anything
are
accustomed
to
cry
but
this
is
liable
to
other
difficulties
and
applies
only
to
the
case
of
joint
finding
priority
of
possession
is
a
fair
way
of
deciding
the
right
of
property
first
on
the
mere
principle
of
a
lottery
or
the
old
saying
come
first
secondly
because
the
expectation
having
been
excited
and
the
will
more
set
upon
it
this
constitutes
a
powerful
reason
for
not
violently
forcing
it
to
let
go
its
hold
the
greater
strength
of
volition
is
we
have
seen
one
foundation
of
right
for
supposing
a
person
to
be
absolutely
indifferent
to
anything
he
could
properly
set
up
no
claim
to
it
labour
or
the
having
produced
a
thing
or
fitted
it
for
use
by
previous
exertion
gives
this
right
chiefly
indeed
for
moral
and
final
causes
because
if
one
enjoyed
what
another
had
produced
there
would
be
nothing
but
idleness
and
rapacity
but
also
in
the
sense
we
are
inquiring
into
because
on
a
merely
selfish
ground
the
labour
undergone
or
the
time
lost
is
entitled
to
an
equivalent
if
another
voluntarily
or
for
a
consideration
resigns
to
me
his
right
in
anything
it
to
all
intents
and
purposes
becomes
mine
this
accounts
not
only
for
gifts
the
transfer
of
property
by
bargains
but
for
legacies
and
the
transmission
of
property
in
families
or
otherwise
it
is
hard
to
make
a
law
to
circumscribe
this
right
of
disposing
of
what
we
have
as
we
please
yet
the
boasted
law
of
primogeniture
which
is
professedly
the
bulwark
and
guardian
of
property
is
in
direct
violation
of
this
principle
and
lastly
where
a
thing
is
common
and
there
is
enough
for
all
and
no
one
contributes
to
it
as
air
or
water
there
can
be
no
property
in
it
the
proximity
to
a
or
the
having
been
the
first
to
establish
a
particular
traffic
in
such
commodities
may
perhaps
give
this
right
by
aggravating
our
will
as
having
a
nearer
or
longer
power
over
them
but
the
rule
is
the
other
way
it
is
on
the
same
principle
that
poaching
is
a
kind
of
honest
thieving
for
that
which
costs
no
trouble
and
is
confined
to
no
limits
seems
to
belong
to
no
one
exclusively
why
else
do
poachers
or
country
people
seize
on
this
kind
of
property
with
the
least
reluctance
but
that
it
is
the
least
like
stealing
and
as
the
game
laws
and
the
tenaciousness
of
the
rights
to
that
which
has
least
the
character
of
property
as
most
a
point
of
honour
produced
a
revolution
in
one
country
so
they
are
not
unlikely
to
produce
it
in
another
the
object
and
principle
of
the
laws
of
property
then
is
this
to
supply
individuals
and
the
community
with
what
they
need
to
secure
an
equal
share
to
each
individual
other
circumstances
being
the
same
to
keep
the
peace
and
promote
industry
and
plenty
by
proportioning
each
man
share
to
his
own
exertions
or
to
the
and
discretion
of
others
the
intention
then
being
that
no
individual
should
rob
another
or
be
starved
but
by
his
refusing
to
work
the
earth
and
its
produce
being
the
natural
estate
of
the
community
subject
to
these
regulations
of
individual
right
and
public
welfare
the
question
is
whether
any
individual
can
have
a
right
to
rob
or
starve
the
whole
community
or
if
the
necessary
discretion
left
in
the
application
of
the
principle
has
led
to
a
state
of
things
subversive
of
the
principle
itself
and
destructive
to
the
welfare
and
existence
of
the
state
whether
the
end
being
defeated
the
law
does
not
fall
to
the
ground
or
require
either
a
powerful
corrective
or
a
total
reconstruction
the
end
is
superior
to
the
means
and
the
use
of
a
thing
does
not
justify
its
abuse
if
a
clock
is
quite
out
of
order
and
always
goes
wrong
it
is
no
argument
to
say
it
was
set
right
at
first
and
on
true
mechanical
principles
and
therefore
it
must
go
on
as
it
has
done
according
to
all
the
rules
of
art
on
the
contrary
it
is
taken
to
pieces
repaired
and
the
whole
restored
to
the
original
state
or
if
this
is
impossible
a
new
one
is
made
so
society
when
out
of
order
which
it
is
whenever
the
interests
of
the
many
are
regularly
and
outrageously
sacrificed
to
those
of
the
few
must
be
repaired
and
either
a
reform
or
a
revolution
cleanse
its
corruptions
and
renew
its
elasticity
people
talk
of
the
poor
laws
as
a
grievance
either
they
or
a
national
bankruptcy
or
a
revolution
are
necessary
the
labouring
population
have
not
doubled
in
the
last
forty
years
there
are
still
no
more
than
are
necessary
to
do
the
work
in
husbandry
that
is
indispensably
required
but
the
wages
of
a
labouring
man
are
no
higher
than
they
were
forty
years
ago
and
the
price
of
food
and
necessaries
is
at
least
double
what
it
was
then
owing
to
taxes
grants
monopolies
and
immense
fortunes
gathered
during
the
war
by
the
richer
or
more
prosperous
classes
who
have
not
ceased
to
propagate
in
the
geometrical
ratio
though
the
poor
have
not
done
it
and
the
maintaining
of
whose
younger
and
increasing
branches
in
becoming
splendour
and
affluence
presses
with
double
weight
on
the
poor
and
labouring
classes
the
greater
part
of
a
community
ought
not
to
be
paupers
or
starving
and
when
a
government
by
obstinacy
and
madness
has
reduced
them
to
that
state
it
must
either
take
wise
and
effectual
measures
to
relieve
them
from
it
or
pay
the
forfeit
of
its
own
wickedness
and
folly
it
seems
then
that
a
system
of
just
and
useful
laws
may
be
constructed
nearly
if
not
wholly
on
the
principle
of
the
right
of
or
the
security
for
person
liberty
and
property
there
are
exceptions
such
for
instance
as
in
the
case
of
children
idiots
and
insane
persons
these
dictates
for
a
general
principle
can
only
hold
good
where
the
general
conditions
are
complied
with
there
are
also
mixed
cases
partaking
of
civil
and
moral
justice
is
a
man
bound
to
support
his
children
not
in
strict
political
right
but
he
may
be
compelled
to
forego
all
the
benefits
of
civil
society
if
he
does
not
fulfil
an
engagement
which
according
to
the
feelings
and
principles
of
that
society
he
has
undertaken
so
in
respect
to
marriage
it
is
a
voluntary
contract
and
the
violation
of
it
is
punishable
on
the
same
plea
of
sympathy
and
custom
government
is
not
necessarily
founded
on
common
consent
but
on
the
right
which
society
has
to
defend
itself
against
all
aggression
but
am
i
bound
to
pay
or
support
the
government
for
defending
the
society
against
any
violence
or
injustice
no
but
then
they
may
withdraw
the
protection
of
the
law
from
me
if
i
refuse
and
it
is
on
this
ground
that
the
contributions
of
each
individual
to
the
maintenance
of
the
state
are
demanded
laws
are
or
ought
to
be
founded
on
the
supposed
infraction
of
individual
rights
if
these
rights
and
the
best
means
of
maintaining
them
are
always
clear
and
there
could
be
no
injustice
or
abuse
of
power
on
the
part
of
the
government
every
government
might
be
its
own
lawgiver
but
as
neither
of
these
is
the
case
it
is
necessary
to
recur
to
the
general
voice
for
settling
the
boundaries
of
right
and
wrong
and
even
more
for
preventing
the
government
under
pretence
of
the
general
peace
and
safety
from
subjecting
the
whole
liberties
rights
and
resources
of
the
community
to
its
own
advantage
and
sole
will
essay
xii
on
the
character
of
burke
there
is
no
single
speech
of
burke
which
can
convey
a
satisfactory
idea
of
his
powers
of
mind
to
do
him
justice
it
would
be
necessary
to
quote
all
his
works
the
only
specimen
of
burke
is
that
he
with
respect
to
most
other
speakers
a
specimen
is
generally
enough
or
more
than
enough
when
you
are
acquainted
with
their
manner
and
see
what
proficiency
they
have
made
in
the
mechanical
exercise
of
their
profession
with
what
facility
they
can
borrow
a
simile
or
round
a
period
how
dexterously
they
can
argue
and
object
and
rejoin
you
are
satisfied
there
is
no
other
difference
in
their
speeches
than
what
arises
from
the
difference
of
the
subjects
but
this
was
not
the
case
with
burke
he
brought
his
subjects
along
with
him
he
drew
his
materials
from
himself
the
only
limits
which
circumscribed
his
variety
were
the
stores
of
his
own
mind
his
stock
of
ideas
did
not
consist
of
a
few
meagre
facts
meagrely
stated
of
commonplaces
tortured
into
a
thousand
different
ways
but
his
mine
of
wealth
was
a
profound
understanding
inexhaustible
as
the
human
heart
and
various
as
the
sources
of
human
nature
he
therefore
enriched
every
subject
to
which
he
applied
himself
and
new
subjects
were
only
the
occasions
of
calling
forth
fresh
powers
of
mind
which
had
not
been
before
exerted
it
would
therefore
be
in
vain
to
look
for
the
proof
of
his
powers
in
any
one
of
his
speeches
or
writings
they
all
contain
some
additional
proof
of
power
in
speaking
of
burke
then
i
shall
speak
of
the
whole
compass
and
circuit
of
his
mind
not
of
that
small
part
or
section
of
him
which
i
have
been
able
to
give
to
do
otherwise
would
be
like
the
story
of
the
man
who
put
the
brick
in
his
pocket
thinking
to
show
it
as
the
model
of
a
house
i
have
been
able
to
manage
pretty
well
with
respect
to
all
my
other
speakers
and
curtailed
them
down
without
remorse
it
was
easy
to
reduce
them
within
certain
limits
to
fix
their
spirit
and
condense
their
variety
by
having
a
certain
quantity
given
you
might
infer
all
the
rest
it
was
only
the
same
thing
over
again
but
who
can
bind
proteus
or
confine
the
roving
flight
of
genius
burke
writings
are
better
than
his
speeches
and
indeed
his
speeches
are
writings
but
he
seemed
to
feel
himself
more
at
ease
to
have
a
fuller
possession
of
his
faculties
in
addressing
the
public
than
in
addressing
the
house
of
commons
burke
was
into
public
life
and
he
seems
to
have
been
prouder
of
this
new
dignity
than
became
so
great
a
man
for
this
reason
most
of
his
speeches
have
a
sort
of
parliamentary
preamble
to
them
he
seems
fond
of
coquetting
with
the
house
of
commons
and
is
perpetually
calling
the
speaker
out
to
dance
a
minuet
with
him
before
he
begins
there
is
also
something
like
an
attempt
to
stimulate
the
superficial
dulness
of
his
hearers
by
exciting
their
surprise
by
running
into
extravagance
and
he
sometimes
demeans
himself
by
condescending
to
what
may
be
considered
as
bordering
too
much
upon
buffoonery
for
the
amusement
of
the
company
those
lines
of
milton
were
admirably
applied
to
him
by
some
one
elephant
to
make
them
sport
wreathed
his
proboscis
lithe
the
truth
is
that
he
was
out
of
his
place
in
the
house
of
commons
he
was
eminently
qualified
to
shine
as
a
man
of
genius
as
the
instructor
of
mankind
as
the
brightest
luminary
of
his
age
but
he
had
nothing
in
common
with
that
motley
crew
of
knights
citizens
and
burgesses
he
could
not
be
said
to
be
and
endued
unto
that
element
he
was
above
it
and
never
appeared
like
himself
but
when
forgetful
of
the
idle
clamours
of
party
and
of
the
little
views
of
little
men
he
applied
to
his
country
and
the
enlightened
judgment
of
mankind
i
am
not
going
to
make
an
idle
panegyric
on
burke
he
has
no
need
of
it
but
i
can
not
help
looking
upon
him
as
the
chief
boast
and
ornament
of
the
english
house
of
commons
what
has
been
said
of
him
is
i
think
strictly
true
that
was
the
most
eloquent
man
of
his
time
his
wisdom
was
greater
than
his
eloquence
the
only
public
man
that
in
my
opinion
can
be
put
in
any
competition
with
him
is
lord
chatham
and
he
moved
in
a
sphere
so
very
remote
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
compare
them
but
though
it
would
perhaps
be
difficult
to
determine
which
of
them
excelled
most
in
his
particular
way
there
is
nothing
in
the
world
more
easy
than
to
point
out
in
what
their
peculiar
excellences
consisted
they
were
in
every
respect
the
reverse
of
each
other
chatham
eloquence
was
popular
his
wisdom
was
altogether
plain
and
practical
burke
eloquence
was
that
of
the
poet
of
the
man
of
high
and
unbounded
fancy
his
wisdom
was
profound
and
contemplative
chatham
eloquence
was
calculated
to
make
men
burke
was
calculated
to
make
them
chatham
could
have
roused
the
fury
of
a
multitude
and
wielded
their
physical
energy
as
he
pleased
burke
eloquence
carried
conviction
into
the
mind
of
the
retired
and
lonely
student
opened
the
recesses
of
the
human
breast
and
lighted
up
the
face
of
nature
around
him
chatham
supplied
his
hearers
with
motives
to
immediate
action
burke
furnished
them
with
for
action
which
might
have
little
effect
upon
them
at
the
time
but
for
which
they
would
be
the
wiser
and
better
all
their
lives
after
in
research
in
originality
in
variety
of
knowledge
in
richness
of
invention
in
depth
and
comprehension
of
mind
burke
had
as
much
the
advantage
of
lord
chatham
as
he
was
excelled
by
him
in
plain
common
sense
in
strong
feeling
in
steadiness
of
purpose
in
vehemence
in
warmth
in
enthusiasm
and
energy
of
mind
burke
was
the
man
of
genius
of
fine
sense
and
subtle
reasoning
chatham
was
a
man
of
clear
understanding
of
strong
sense
and
violent
passions
burke
mind
was
satisfied
with
speculation
chatham
was
essentially
it
could
not
rest
without
an
object
the
power
which
governed
burke
mind
was
his
imagination
that
which
gave
its
to
chatham
was
will
the
one
was
almost
the
creature
of
pure
intellect
the
other
of
physical
temperament
there
are
two
very
different
ends
which
a
man
of
genius
may
propose
to
himself
either
in
writing
or
speaking
and
which
will
accordingly
give
birth
to
very
different
styles
he
can
have
but
one
of
these
two
objects
either
to
enrich
or
strengthen
the
mind
either
to
furnish
us
with
new
ideas
to
lead
the
mind
into
new
trains
of
thought
to
which
it
was
before
unused
and
which
it
was
incapable
of
striking
out
for
itself
or
else
to
collect
and
embody
what
we
already
knew
to
rivet
our
old
impressions
more
deeply
to
make
what
was
before
plain
still
plainer
and
to
give
to
that
which
was
familiar
all
the
effect
of
novelty
in
the
one
case
we
receive
an
accession
to
the
stock
of
our
ideas
in
the
other
an
additional
degree
of
life
and
energy
is
infused
into
them
our
thoughts
continue
to
flow
in
the
same
channels
but
their
pulse
is
quickened
and
invigorated
i
do
not
know
how
to
distinguish
these
different
styles
better
than
by
calling
them
severally
the
inventive
and
refined
or
the
impressive
and
vigorous
styles
it
is
only
the
of
eloquence
however
which
is
allowed
to
be
remote
or
obscure
the
things
themselves
may
be
subtle
and
recondite
but
they
must
be
dragged
out
of
their
obscurity
and
brought
struggling
to
the
light
they
must
be
rendered
plain
and
palpable
as
far
as
it
is
in
the
wit
of
man
to
do
so
or
they
are
no
longer
eloquence
that
which
by
its
natural
impenetrability
and
in
spite
of
every
effort
remains
dark
and
difficult
which
is
impervious
to
every
ray
on
which
the
imagination
can
shed
no
lustre
which
can
be
clothed
with
no
beauty
is
not
a
subject
for
the
orator
or
poet
at
the
same
time
it
can
not
be
expected
that
abstract
truths
or
profound
observations
should
ever
be
placed
in
the
same
strong
and
dazzling
points
of
view
as
natural
objects
and
mere
matters
of
fact
it
is
enough
if
they
receive
a
reflex
and
borrowed
lustre
like
that
which
cheers
the
first
dawn
of
morning
where
the
effect
of
surprise
and
novelty
gilds
every
object
and
the
joy
of
beholding
another
world
gradually
emerging
out
of
the
gloom
of
night
new
creation
rescued
from
his
reign
fills
the
mind
with
a
sober
rapture
philosophical
eloquence
is
in
writing
what
is
in
painting
he
would
be
a
fool
who
should
object
that
the
colours
in
the
shaded
part
of
a
picture
were
not
so
bright
as
those
on
the
opposite
side
the
eye
of
the
connoisseur
receives
an
equal
delight
from
both
balancing
the
want
of
brilliancy
and
effect
with
the
greater
delicacy
of
the
tints
and
difficulty
of
the
execution
in
judging
of
burke
therefore
we
are
to
consider
first
the
style
of
eloquence
which
he
adopted
and
secondly
the
effects
which
he
produced
with
it
if
he
did
not
produce
the
same
effects
on
vulgar
minds
as
some
others
have
done
it
was
not
for
want
of
power
but
from
the
turn
and
direction
of
his
mind
it
was
because
his
subjects
his
ideas
his
arguments
were
less
vulgar
the
question
is
not
whether
he
brought
certain
truths
equally
home
to
us
but
how
much
nearer
he
brought
them
than
they
were
before
in
my
opinion
he
united
the
two
extremes
of
refinement
and
strength
in
a
higher
degree
than
any
other
writer
whatever
the
subtlety
of
his
mind
was
undoubtedly
that
which
rendered
burke
a
less
popular
writer
and
speaker
than
he
otherwise
would
have
been
it
weakened
the
impression
of
his
observations
upon
others
but
i
can
not
admit
that
it
weakened
the
observations
themselves
that
it
took
anything
from
their
real
weight
or
solidity
coarse
minds
think
all
that
is
subtle
futile
that
because
it
is
not
gross
and
obvious
and
palpable
to
the
senses
it
is
therefore
light
and
frivolous
and
of
no
importance
in
the
real
affairs
of
life
thus
making
their
own
confined
understandings
the
measure
of
truth
and
supposing
that
whatever
they
do
not
distinctly
perceive
is
nothing
seneca
who
was
not
one
of
the
vulgar
also
says
that
subtle
truths
are
those
which
have
the
least
substance
in
them
and
consequently
approach
nearest
to
nonentity
but
for
my
own
part
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
the
most
important
truths
must
be
the
most
refined
and
subtle
for
that
very
reason
that
they
must
comprehend
a
great
number
of
particulars
and
instead
of
referring
to
any
distinct
or
positive
fact
must
point
out
the
combined
effects
of
an
extensive
chain
of
causes
operating
gradually
remotely
and
collectively
and
therefore
imperceptibly
general
principles
are
not
the
less
true
or
important
because
from
their
nature
they
elude
immediate
observation
they
are
like
the
air
which
is
not
the
less
necessary
because
we
neither
see
nor
feel
it
or
like
that
secret
influence
which
binds
the
world
together
and
holds
the
planets
in
their
orbits
the
very
same
persons
who
are
the
most
forward
to
laugh
at
all
systematic
reasoning
as
idle
and
impertinent
you
will
the
next
moment
hear
exclaiming
bitterly
against
the
baleful
effects
of
systems
of
philosophy
or
gravely
descanting
on
the
immense
importance
of
instilling
sound
principles
of
morality
into
the
mind
it
would
not
be
a
bold
conjecture
but
an
obvious
truism
to
say
that
all
the
great
changes
which
have
been
brought
about
in
the
mortal
world
either
for
the
better
or
worse
have
been
introduced
not
by
the
bare
statement
of
facts
which
are
things
already
known
and
which
must
always
operate
nearly
in
the
same
manner
but
by
the
development
of
certain
opinions
and
abstract
principles
of
reasoning
on
life
and
manners
or
the
origin
of
society
and
man
nature
in
general
which
being
obscure
and
uncertain
vary
from
time
to
time
and
produce
corresponding
changes
in
the
human
mind
they
are
the
wholesome
dew
and
rain
or
the
mildew
and
pestilence
that
silently
destroy
to
this
principle
of
generalisation
all
wise
lawgivers
and
the
systems
of
philosophers
owe
their
influence
it
has
always
been
with
me
a
test
of
the
sense
and
candour
of
any
one
belonging
to
the
opposite
party
whether
he
allowed
burke
to
be
a
great
man
of
all
the
persons
of
this
description
that
i
have
ever
known
i
never
met
with
above
one
or
two
who
would
make
this
concession
whether
it
was
that
party
feelings
ran
too
high
to
admit
of
any
real
candour
or
whether
it
was
owing
to
an
essential
vulgarity
in
their
habits
of
thinking
they
all
seemed
to
be
of
opinion
that
he
was
a
wild
enthusiast
or
a
hollow
sophist
who
was
to
be
answered
by
bits
of
facts
by
smart
logic
by
shrewd
questions
and
idle
songs
they
looked
upon
him
as
a
man
of
disordered
intellects
because
he
reasoned
in
a
style
to
which
they
had
not
been
used
and
which
confounded
their
dim
perceptions
if
you
said
that
though
you
differed
with
him
in
sentiment
yet
you
thought
him
an
admirable
reasoner
and
a
close
observer
of
human
nature
you
were
answered
with
a
loud
laugh
and
some
hackneyed
quotation
leviathan
was
not
so
tamed
they
did
not
know
whom
they
had
to
contend
with
the
which
the
builders
rejected
became
the
though
to
the
jews
a
and
to
the
greeks
foolishness
for
indeed
i
can
not
discover
that
he
was
much
better
understood
by
those
of
his
own
party
if
we
may
judge
from
the
little
affinity
there
is
between
his
mode
of
reasoning
and
theirs
the
simple
clue
to
all
his
reasonings
on
politics
is
i
think
as
follows
he
did
not
agree
with
some
writers
that
that
mode
of
government
is
necessarily
the
best
which
is
the
cheapest
he
saw
in
the
construction
of
society
other
principles
at
work
and
other
capacities
of
fulfilling
the
desires
and
perfecting
the
nature
of
man
besides
those
of
securing
the
equal
enjoyment
of
the
means
of
animal
life
and
doing
this
at
as
little
expense
as
possible
he
thought
that
the
wants
and
happiness
of
men
were
not
to
be
provided
for
as
we
provide
for
those
of
a
herd
of
cattle
merely
by
attending
to
their
physical
necessities
he
thought
more
nobly
of
his
fellows
he
knew
that
man
had
affections
and
passions
and
powers
of
imagination
as
well
as
hunger
and
thirst
and
the
sense
of
heat
and
cold
he
took
his
idea
of
political
society
from
the
pattern
of
private
life
wishing
as
he
himself
expresses
it
to
incorporate
the
domestic
charities
with
the
orders
of
the
state
and
to
blend
them
together
he
strove
to
establish
an
analogy
between
the
compact
that
binds
together
the
community
at
large
and
that
which
binds
together
the
several
families
that
compose
it
he
knew
that
the
rules
that
form
the
basis
of
private
morality
are
not
founded
in
reason
that
is
in
the
abstract
properties
of
those
things
which
are
the
subjects
of
them
but
in
the
nature
of
man
and
his
capacity
of
being
affected
by
certain
things
from
habit
from
imagination
and
sentiment
as
well
as
from
reason
thus
the
reason
why
a
man
ought
to
be
attached
to
his
wife
and
children
is
not
surely
that
they
are
better
than
others
for
in
this
case
every
one
else
ought
to
be
of
the
same
opinion
but
because
he
must
be
chiefly
interested
in
those
things
which
are
nearest
to
him
and
with
which
he
is
best
acquainted
since
his
understanding
can
not
reach
equally
to
everything
because
he
must
be
most
attached
to
those
objects
which
he
has
known
the
longest
and
which
by
their
situation
have
actually
affected
him
the
most
not
those
which
in
themselves
are
the
most
affecting
whether
they
have
ever
made
any
impression
on
him
or
no
that
is
because
he
is
by
his
nature
the
creature
of
habit
and
feeling
and
because
it
is
reasonable
that
he
should
act
in
conformity
to
his
nature
burke
was
so
far
right
in
saying
that
it
is
no
objection
to
an
institution
that
it
is
founded
in
but
the
contrary
if
that
prejudice
is
natural
and
right
that
is
if
it
arises
from
those
circumstances
which
are
properly
subjects
of
feeling
and
association
not
from
any
defect
or
perversion
of
the
understanding
in
those
things
which
fall
strictly
under
its
jurisdiction
on
this
profound
maxim
he
took
his
stand
thus
he
contended
that
the
prejudice
in
favour
of
nobility
was
natural
and
proper
and
fit
to
be
encouraged
by
the
positive
institutions
of
society
not
on
account
of
the
real
or
personal
merit
of
the
individuals
but
because
such
an
institution
has
a
tendency
to
enlarge
and
raise
the
mind
to
keep
alive
the
memory
of
past
greatness
to
connect
the
different
ages
of
the
world
together
to
carry
back
the
imagination
over
a
long
tract
of
time
and
feed
it
with
the
contemplation
of
remote
events
because
it
is
natural
to
think
highly
of
that
which
inspires
us
with
high
thoughts
which
has
been
connected
for
many
generations
with
splendour
and
affluence
and
dignity
and
power
and
privilege
he
also
conceived
that
by
transferring
the
respect
from
the
person
to
the
thing
and
thus
rendering
it
steady
and
permanent
the
mind
would
be
habitually
formed
to
sentiments
of
deference
attachment
and
fealty
to
whatever
else
demanded
its
respect
that
it
would
be
led
to
fix
its
view
on
what
was
elevated
and
lofty
and
be
weaned
from
that
low
and
narrow
jealousy
which
never
willingly
or
heartily
admits
of
any
superiority
in
others
and
is
glad
of
every
opportunity
to
bring
down
all
excellence
to
a
level
with
its
own
miserable
standard
nobility
did
not
therefore
exist
to
the
prejudice
of
the
other
orders
of
the
state
but
by
and
for
them
the
inequality
of
the
different
orders
of
society
did
not
destroy
the
unity
and
harmony
of
the
whole
the
health
and
of
the
moral
world
was
to
be
promoted
by
the
same
means
as
the
beauty
of
the
natural
world
by
contrast
by
change
by
light
and
shade
by
variety
of
parts
by
order
and
proportion
to
think
of
reducing
all
mankind
to
the
same
insipid
level
seemed
to
him
the
same
absurdity
as
to
destroy
the
inequalities
of
surface
in
a
country
for
the
benefit
of
agriculture
and
commerce
in
short
he
believed
that
the
interests
of
men
in
society
should
be
consulted
and
their
several
stations
and
employments
assigned
with
a
view
to
their
nature
not
as
physical
but
as
moral
beings
so
as
to
nourish
their
hopes
to
lift
their
imagination
to
enliven
their
fancy
to
rouse
their
activity
to
strengthen
their
virtue
and
to
furnish
the
greatest
number
of
objects
of
pursuit
and
means
of
enjoyment
to
beings
constituted
as
man
is
consistently
with
the
order
and
stability
of
the
whole
the
same
reasoning
might
be
extended
farther
i
do
not
say
that
his
arguments
are
conclusive
but
they
are
profound
and
as
far
as
they
go
there
may
be
disadvantages
and
abuses
necessarily
interwoven
with
his
scheme
or
opposite
advantages
of
infinitely
greater
value
to
be
derived
from
another
order
of
things
and
state
of
society
this
however
does
not
invalidate
either
the
truth
or
importance
of
reasoning
since
the
advantages
he
points
out
as
connected
with
the
mixed
form
of
government
are
really
and
necessarily
inherent
in
it
since
they
are
compatible
in
the
same
degree
with
no
other
since
the
principle
itself
on
which
he
rests
his
argument
whatever
we
may
think
of
the
application
is
of
the
utmost
weight
and
moment
and
since
on
whichever
side
the
truth
lies
it
is
impossible
to
make
a
fair
decision
without
having
the
opposite
side
of
the
question
clearly
and
fully
stated
to
us
this
burke
has
done
in
a
masterly
manner
he
presents
to
you
one
view
or
face
of
society
let
him
who
thinks
he
can
give
the
reverse
side
with
equal
force
beauty
and
clearness
it
is
said
i
know
that
truth
is
but
to
this
i
can
not
subscribe
for
it
appears
to
me
that
truth
is
there
are
as
many
truths
as
there
are
things
and
causes
of
action
and
contradictory
principles
at
work
in
society
in
making
up
the
account
of
good
and
evil
indeed
the
final
result
must
be
one
way
or
the
other
but
the
particulars
on
which
that
result
depends
are
infinite
and
various
it
will
be
seen
from
what
i
have
said
that
i
am
very
far
from
agreeing
with
those
who
think
that
burke
was
a
man
without
understanding
and
a
merely
florid
writer
there
are
two
causes
which
have
given
rise
to
this
calumny
namely
that
narrowness
of
mind
which
leads
men
to
suppose
that
the
truth
lies
entirely
on
the
side
of
their
own
opinions
and
that
whatever
does
not
make
for
them
is
absurd
and
irrational
secondly
a
trick
we
have
of
confounding
reason
with
judgment
and
supposing
that
it
is
merely
the
province
of
the
understanding
to
pronounce
sentence
and
not
to
give
evidence
or
argue
the
case
in
short
that
it
is
a
passive
not
an
active
faculty
thus
there
are
persons
who
never
run
into
any
extravagance
because
they
are
so
buttressed
up
with
the
opinions
of
others
on
all
sides
that
they
can
not
lean
much
to
one
side
or
the
other
they
are
so
little
moved
with
any
kind
of
reasoning
that
they
remain
at
an
equal
distance
from
every
extreme
and
are
never
very
far
from
the
truth
because
the
slowness
of
their
faculties
will
not
suffer
them
to
make
much
progress
in
error
these
are
persons
of
great
judgment
the
scales
of
the
mind
are
pretty
sure
to
remain
even
when
there
is
nothing
in
them
in
this
sense
of
the
word
burke
must
be
allowed
to
have
wanted
judgment
by
all
those
who
think
that
he
was
wrong
in
his
conclusions
the
accusation
of
want
of
judgment
in
fact
only
means
that
you
yourself
are
of
a
different
opinion
but
if
in
arriving
at
one
error
he
discovered
a
hundred
truths
i
should
consider
myself
a
hundred
times
more
indebted
to
him
than
if
stumbling
on
that
which
i
consider
as
the
right
side
of
the
question
he
had
committed
a
hundred
absurdities
in
striving
to
establish
his
point
i
speak
of
him
now
merely
as
an
author
or
as
far
as
i
and
other
readers
are
concerned
with
him
at
the
same
time
i
should
not
differ
from
any
one
who
may
be
disposed
to
contend
that
the
consequences
of
his
writings
as
instruments
of
political
power
have
been
tremendous
fatal
such
as
no
exertion
of
wit
or
knowledge
or
genius
can
ever
counteract
or
atone
for
burke
also
gave
a
hold
to
his
antagonists
by
mixing
up
sentiment
and
imagery
with
his
reasoning
so
that
being
unused
to
such
a
sight
in
the
region
of
politics
they
were
deceived
and
could
not
discern
the
fruit
from
the
flowers
gravity
is
the
cloak
of
wisdom
and
those
who
have
nothing
else
think
it
an
insult
to
affect
the
one
without
the
other
because
it
destroys
the
only
foundation
on
which
their
pretensions
are
built
the
easiest
part
of
reason
is
dulness
the
generality
of
the
world
are
therefore
concerned
in
discouraging
any
example
of
unnecessary
brilliancy
that
might
tend
to
show
that
the
two
things
do
not
always
go
together
burke
in
some
measure
dissolved
the
spell
it
was
discovered
that
his
gold
was
not
the
less
valuable
for
being
wrought
into
elegant
shapes
and
richly
embossed
with
curious
figures
that
the
solidity
of
a
building
is
not
destroyed
by
adding
to
it
beauty
and
ornament
and
that
the
strength
of
a
man
understanding
is
not
always
to
be
estimated
in
exact
proportion
to
his
want
of
imagination
his
understanding
was
not
the
less
real
because
it
was
not
the
only
faculty
he
possessed
he
justified
the
description
of
the
poet
charming
is
divine
philosophy
not
harsh
and
crabbed
as
dull
fools
suppose
but
musical
as
is
apollo
lute
those
who
object
to
this
union
of
grace
and
beauty
with
reason
are
in
fact
people
who
can
not
distinguish
the
noble
and
majestic
form
of
truth
from
that
of
her
sister
folly
if
they
are
dressed
both
alike
but
there
is
always
a
difference
even
in
the
adventitious
ornaments
they
wear
which
is
sufficient
to
distinguish
them
burke
was
so
far
from
being
a
gaudy
or
flowery
writer
that
he
was
one
of
the
severest
writers
we
have
his
words
are
the
most
like
things
his
style
is
the
most
strictly
suited
to
the
subject
he
unites
every
extreme
and
every
variety
of
composition
the
lowest
and
the
meanest
words
and
descriptions
with
the
highest
he
exults
in
the
display
of
power
in
showing
the
extent
the
force
and
intensity
of
his
ideas
he
is
led
on
by
the
mere
impulse
and
vehemence
of
his
fancy
not
by
the
affectation
of
dazzling
his
readers
by
gaudy
conceits
or
pompous
images
he
was
completely
carried
away
by
his
subject
he
had
no
other
object
but
to
produce
the
strongest
impression
on
his
reader
by
giving
the
truest
the
most
characteristic
the
fullest
and
most
forcible
description
of
things
trusting
to
the
power
of
his
own
mind
to
mould
them
into
grace
and
beauty
he
did
not
produce
a
splendid
effect
by
setting
fire
to
the
light
vapours
that
float
in
the
regions
of
fancy
as
the
chemists
make
fine
colours
with
phosphorus
but
by
the
eagerness
of
his
blows
struck
fire
from
the
flint
and
melted
the
hardest
substances
in
the
furnace
of
his
imagination
the
wheels
of
his
imagination
did
not
catch
fire
from
the
rottenness
of
the
materials
but
from
the
rapidity
of
their
motion
one
would
suppose
to
hear
people
talk
of
burke
that
his
style
was
such
as
would
have
suited
the
soft
smooth
showy
tender
insipid
full
of
fine
words
without
any
meaning
the
essence
of
the
gaudy
or
glittering
style
consists
in
producing
a
momentary
effect
by
fine
words
and
images
brought
together
without
order
or
connection
burke
most
frequently
produced
an
effect
by
the
remoteness
and
novelty
of
his
combinations
by
the
force
of
contrast
by
the
striking
manner
in
which
the
most
opposite
and
unpromising
materials
were
harmoniously
blended
together
not
by
laying
his
hands
on
all
the
fine
things
he
could
think
of
but
by
bringing
together
those
things
which
he
knew
would
blaze
out
into
glorious
light
by
their
collision
the
florid
style
is
a
mixture
of
affectation
and
commonplace
burke
was
an
union
of
untameable
vigour
and
originality
burke
was
not
a
verbose
writer
if
he
sometimes
multiplies
words
it
is
not
for
want
of
ideas
but
because
there
are
no
words
that
fully
express
his
ideas
and
he
tries
to
do
it
as
well
as
he
can
by
different
ones
he
had
nothing
of
the
or
formal
style
the
measured
cadence
and
stately
phraseology
of
johnson
and
most
of
our
modern
writers
this
style
which
is
what
we
understand
by
the
is
all
in
one
key
it
selects
a
certain
set
of
words
to
represent
all
ideas
whatever
as
the
most
dignified
and
elegant
and
excludes
all
others
as
low
and
vulgar
the
words
are
not
fitted
to
the
things
but
the
things
to
the
words
everything
is
seen
through
a
false
medium
it
is
putting
a
mask
on
the
face
of
nature
which
may
indeed
hide
some
specks
and
blemishes
but
takes
away
all
beauty
delicacy
and
variety
it
destroys
all
dignity
or
elevation
because
nothing
can
be
raised
where
all
is
on
a
level
and
completely
destroys
all
force
expression
truth
and
character
by
arbitrarily
confounding
the
differences
of
things
and
reducing
everything
to
the
same
insipid
standard
to
suppose
that
this
stiff
uniformity
can
add
anything
to
real
grace
or
dignity
is
like
supposing
that
the
human
body
in
order
to
be
perfectly
graceful
should
never
deviate
from
its
upright
posture
another
mischief
of
this
method
is
that
it
confounds
all
ranks
in
literature
where
there
is
no
room
for
variety
no
discrimination
no
nicety
to
be
shown
in
matching
the
idea
with
its
proper
word
there
can
be
no
room
for
taste
or
elegance
a
man
must
easily
learn
the
art
of
writing
when
every
sentence
is
to
be
cast
in
the
same
mould
where
he
is
only
allowed
the
use
of
one
word
he
can
not
choose
wrong
nor
will
he
be
in
much
danger
of
making
himself
ridiculous
by
affectation
or
false
glitter
when
whatever
subject
he
treats
of
he
must
treat
of
it
in
the
same
way
this
indeed
is
to
wear
golden
chains
for
the
sake
of
ornament
burke
was
altogether
free
from
the
pedantry
which
i
have
here
endeavoured
to
expose
his
style
was
as
original
as
expressive
as
rich
and
varied
as
it
was
possible
his
combinations
were
as
exquisite
as
playful
as
happy
as
unexpected
as
bold
and
daring
as
his
fancy
if
anything
he
ran
into
the
opposite
extreme
of
too
great
an
inequality
if
truth
and
nature
could
ever
be
carried
to
an
extreme
those
who
are
best
acquainted
with
the
writings
and
speeches
of
burke
will
not
think
the
praise
i
have
here
bestowed
on
them
exaggerated
some
proof
will
be
found
of
this
in
the
following
extracts
but
the
full
proof
must
be
sought
in
his
works
at
large
and
particularly
in
the
on
the
in
his
on
the
french
in
his
to
the
duke
of
and
in
the
the
two
last
of
these
are
perhaps
the
most
remarkable
of
all
his
writings
from
the
contrast
they
afford
to
each
other
the
one
is
the
most
delightful
exhibition
of
wild
and
brilliant
fancy
that
is
to
be
found
in
english
prose
but
it
is
too
much
like
a
beautiful
picture
painted
upon
gauze
it
wants
something
to
support
it
the
other
is
without
ornament
but
it
has
all
the
solidity
the
weight
the
gravity
of
a
judicial
record
it
seems
to
have
been
written
with
a
certain
constraint
upon
himself
and
to
show
those
who
said
he
could
not
that
his
arguments
might
be
stripped
of
their
ornaments
without
losing
anything
of
their
force
it
is
certainly
of
all
his
works
that
in
which
he
has
shown
most
power
of
logical
deduction
and
the
only
one
in
which
he
has
made
any
important
use
of
facts
in
general
he
certainly
paid
little
attention
to
them
they
were
the
playthings
of
his
mind
he
saw
them
as
he
pleased
not
as
they
were
with
the
eye
of
the
philosopher
or
the
poet
regarding
them
only
in
their
general
principle
or
as
they
might
serve
to
decorate
his
subject
this
is
the
natural
consequence
of
much
imagination
things
that
are
probable
are
elevated
into
the
rank
of
realities
to
those
who
can
reason
on
the
essences
of
things
or
who
can
invent
according
to
nature
the
experimental
proof
is
of
little
value
this
was
the
case
with
burke
in
the
present
instance
however
he
seems
to
have
forced
his
mind
into
the
service
of
facts
and
he
succeeded
completely
his
comparison
between
our
connection
with
france
or
algiers
and
his
account
of
the
conduct
of
the
war
are
as
clear
as
convincing
as
forcible
examples
of
this
kind
of
reasoning
as
are
anywhere
to
be
met
with
indeed
i
do
not
think
there
is
anything
in
fox
whose
mind
was
purely
historical
or
in
chatham
who
attended
to
feelings
more
than
facts
that
will
bear
a
comparison
with
them
burke
has
been
compared
to
cicero
i
do
not
know
for
what
reason
their
excellences
are
as
different
and
indeed
as
opposite
as
they
can
well
be
burke
had
not
the
polished
elegance
the
glossy
neatness
the
artful
regularity
the
exquisite
modulation
of
cicero
he
had
a
thousand
times
more
richness
and
originality
of
mind
more
strength
and
pomp
of
diction
it
has
been
well
observed
that
the
ancients
had
no
word
that
properly
expresses
what
we
mean
by
the
word
they
perhaps
had
not
the
thing
their
minds
appear
to
have
been
too
exact
too
retentive
too
minute
and
subtle
too
sensible
to
the
external
differences
of
things
too
passive
under
their
impressions
to
admit
of
those
bold
and
rapid
combinations
those
lofty
flights
of
fancy
which
glancing
from
heaven
to
earth
unite
the
most
opposite
extremes
and
draw
the
happiest
illustrations
from
things
the
most
remote
their
ideas
were
kept
too
confined
and
distinct
by
the
material
form
or
vehicle
in
which
they
were
conveyed
to
unite
cordially
together
to
be
melted
down
in
the
imagination
their
metaphors
are
taken
from
things
of
the
same
class
not
from
things
of
different
classes
the
general
analogy
not
the
individual
feeling
directs
them
in
their
choice
hence
as
johnson
observed
their
similes
are
either
repetitions
of
the
same
idea
or
so
obvious
and
general
as
not
to
lend
any
additional
force
to
it
as
when
a
huntress
is
compared
to
diana
or
a
warrior
rushing
into
battle
to
a
lion
rushing
on
his
prey
their
was
exquisite
art
and
perfect
imitation
witness
their
statues
and
other
things
of
the
same
kind
but
they
had
not
that
high
and
enthusiastic
fancy
which
some
of
our
own
writers
have
shown
for
the
proof
of
this
let
any
one
compare
milton
and
shakspeare
with
homer
and
sophocles
or
burke
with
cicero
it
may
be
asked
whether
burke
was
a
poet
he
was
so
only
in
the
general
vividness
of
his
fancy
and
in
richness
of
invention
there
may
be
poetical
passages
in
his
works
but
i
certainly
think
that
his
writings
in
general
are
quite
distinct
from
poetry
and
that
for
the
reason
before
given
namely
that
the
of
them
is
not
poetical
the
finest
part
of
them
are
illustrations
or
personifications
of
dry
abstract
ideas
and
the
union
between
the
idea
and
the
illustration
is
not
of
that
perfect
and
pleasing
kind
as
to
constitute
poetry
or
indeed
to
be
admissible
but
for
the
effect
intended
to
be
produced
by
it
that
is
by
every
means
in
our
power
to
give
animation
and
attraction
to
subjects
in
themselves
barren
of
ornament
but
which
at
the
same
time
are
pregnant
with
the
most
important
consequences
and
in
which
the
understanding
and
the
passions
are
equally
interested
i
have
heard
it
remarked
by
a
person
to
whose
opinion
i
would
sooner
submit
than
to
a
general
council
of
critics
that
the
sound
of
prose
is
not
musical
that
it
wants
cadence
and
that
instead
of
being
so
lavish
of
his
imagery
as
is
generally
supposed
he
seemed
to
him
to
be
rather
parsimonious
in
the
use
of
it
always
expanding
and
making
the
most
of
his
ideas
this
may
be
true
if
we
compare
him
with
some
of
our
poets
or
perhaps
with
some
of
our
early
prose
writers
but
not
if
we
compare
him
with
any
of
our
political
writers
or
parliamentary
speakers
there
are
some
very
fine
things
of
lord
bolingbroke
on
the
same
subjects
but
not
equal
to
burke
as
for
junius
he
is
at
the
head
of
his
class
but
that
class
is
not
the
highest
he
has
been
said
to
have
more
dignity
than
burke
yes
if
the
stalk
of
a
giant
is
less
dignified
than
the
strut
of
a
i
do
not
mean
to
speak
disrespectfully
of
junius
but
grandeur
is
not
the
character
of
his
composition
and
if
it
is
not
to
be
found
in
burke
it
is
to
be
found
nowhere
footnotes
for
instance
he
produced
less
effect
on
the
mob
that
compose
the
english
house
of
commons
than
chatham
or
fox
or
even
pitt
as
in
the
comparison
of
the
british
constitution
to
the
keep
of
windsor
the
most
splendid
passage
in
his
works
essay
xiii
on
the
character
of
fox
i
shall
begin
with
observing
generally
that
fox
excelled
all
his
contemporaries
in
the
extent
of
his
knowledge
in
the
clearness
and
distinctness
of
his
views
in
quickness
of
apprehension
in
plain
practical
common
sense
in
the
full
strong
and
absolute
possession
of
his
subject
a
measure
was
no
sooner
proposed
than
he
seemed
to
have
an
instantaneous
and
intuitive
perception
of
its
various
bearings
and
consequences
of
the
manner
in
which
it
would
operate
on
the
different
classes
of
society
on
commerce
or
agriculture
on
our
domestic
or
foreign
policy
of
the
difficulties
attending
its
execution
in
a
word
of
all
its
practical
results
and
the
comparative
advantages
to
be
gained
either
by
adopting
or
rejecting
it
he
was
intimately
acquainted
with
the
interests
of
the
different
parts
of
the
community
with
the
minute
and
complicated
details
of
political
economy
with
our
external
relations
with
the
views
the
resources
and
the
maxims
of
other
states
he
was
master
of
all
those
facts
and
circumstances
which
it
was
necessary
to
know
in
order
to
judge
fairly
and
determine
wisely
and
he
knew
them
not
loosely
or
lightly
but
in
number
weight
and
measure
he
had
also
stored
his
memory
by
reading
and
general
study
and
improved
his
understanding
by
the
lamp
of
history
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
opinions
and
sentiments
of
the
best
authors
with
the
maxims
of
the
most
profound
politicians
with
the
causes
of
the
rise
and
fall
of
states
with
the
general
passions
of
men
with
the
characters
of
different
nations
and
the
laws
and
constitution
of
his
own
country
he
was
a
man
of
large
capacious
powerful
and
highly
cultivated
intellect
no
man
could
know
more
than
he
knew
no
man
knowledge
could
be
more
sound
more
plain
and
useful
no
man
knowledge
could
lie
in
more
connected
and
tangible
masses
no
man
could
be
more
perfectly
master
of
his
ideas
could
reason
upon
them
more
closely
or
decide
upon
them
more
impartially
his
mind
was
full
even
to
overflowing
he
was
so
habitually
conversant
with
the
most
intricate
and
comprehensive
trains
of
thought
or
such
was
the
natural
vigour
and
exuberance
of
his
mind
that
he
seemed
to
recall
them
without
any
effort
his
ideas
quarrelled
for
utterance
so
far
from
ever
being
at
a
loss
for
them
he
was
obliged
rather
to
repress
and
rein
them
in
lest
they
should
overwhelm
and
confound
instead
of
informing
the
understandings
of
his
hearers
if
to
this
we
add
the
ardour
and
natural
impetuosity
of
his
mind
his
quick
sensibility
his
eagerness
in
the
defence
of
truth
and
his
impatience
of
everything
that
looked
like
trick
or
artifice
or
affectation
we
shall
be
able
in
some
measure
to
account
for
the
character
of
his
eloquence
his
thoughts
came
crowding
in
too
fast
for
the
slow
and
mechanical
process
of
speech
what
he
saw
in
an
instant
he
could
only
express
imperfectly
word
by
word
and
sentence
after
sentence
he
would
if
he
could
bared
his
swelling
heart
and
laid
open
at
once
the
rich
treasures
of
knowledge
with
which
his
bosom
was
fraught
it
is
no
wonder
that
this
difference
between
the
rapidity
of
his
feelings
and
the
formal
method
of
communicating
them
should
produce
some
disorder
in
his
frame
that
the
throng
of
his
ideas
should
try
to
overleap
the
narrow
boundaries
which
confined
them
and
tumultuously
break
down
their
instead
of
waiting
to
be
let
out
one
by
one
and
following
patiently
at
due
intervals
and
with
mock
dignity
like
poor
dependents
in
the
train
of
words
that
he
should
express
himself
in
hurried
sentences
in
involuntary
exclamations
by
vehement
gestures
by
sudden
starts
and
bursts
of
passion
everything
showed
the
agitation
of
his
mind
his
tongue
faltered
his
voice
became
almost
suffocated
and
his
face
was
bathed
in
tears
he
was
lost
in
the
magnitude
of
his
subject
he
reeled
and
staggered
under
the
load
of
feeling
which
oppressed
him
he
rolled
like
the
sea
beaten
by
a
tempest
whoever
having
the
feelings
of
a
man
compared
him
at
these
times
with
his
boasted
rival
his
stiff
straight
upright
figure
his
gradual
contortions
turning
round
as
if
moved
by
a
pivot
his
solemn
pauses
his
deep
tones
sound
reverbed
their
own
hollowness
must
have
said
this
is
a
man
that
is
an
automaton
if
fox
had
needed
grace
he
would
have
had
it
but
it
was
not
the
character
of
his
mind
nor
would
it
have
suited
with
the
style
of
his
eloquence
it
was
pitt
object
to
smooth
over
the
abruptness
and
intricacies
of
his
argument
by
the
gracefulness
of
his
manner
and
to
fix
the
attention
of
his
hearers
on
the
pomp
and
sound
of
his
words
lord
chatham
again
strove
to
others
he
did
not
try
to
convince
them
but
to
overpower
their
understandings
by
the
greater
strength
and
vehemence
of
his
own
to
awe
them
by
a
sense
of
personal
superiority
and
he
therefore
was
obliged
to
assume
a
lofty
and
dignified
manner
it
was
to
him
they
bowed
not
to
truth
and
whatever
related
to
must
therefore
have
a
tendency
to
inspire
respect
and
admiration
indeed
he
would
never
have
attempted
to
gain
that
ascendant
over
men
minds
that
he
did
if
either
his
mind
or
body
had
been
different
from
what
they
were
if
his
temper
had
not
urged
him
to
control
and
command
others
or
if
his
personal
advantages
had
not
enabled
him
to
secure
that
kind
of
authority
which
he
coveted
but
it
would
have
been
ridiculous
in
fox
to
have
affected
either
the
smooth
plausibility
the
stately
gravity
of
the
one
or
the
proud
domineering
imposing
dignity
of
the
other
or
even
if
he
could
have
succeeded
it
would
only
have
injured
the
effect
of
his
speeches
what
he
had
to
rely
on
was
the
strength
the
solidity
of
his
ideas
his
complete
and
thorough
knowledge
of
his
subject
it
was
his
business
therefore
to
fix
the
attention
of
his
hearers
not
on
himself
but
on
his
subject
to
rivet
it
there
to
hurry
it
on
from
words
to
things
the
only
circumstance
of
which
they
required
to
be
convinced
with
respect
to
himself
was
the
sincerity
of
his
opinions
and
this
would
be
best
done
by
the
earnestness
of
his
manner
by
giving
a
loose
to
his
feelings
and
by
showing
the
most
perfect
forgetfulness
of
himself
and
of
what
others
thought
of
him
the
moment
a
man
shows
you
either
by
affected
words
or
looks
or
gestures
that
he
is
thinking
of
himself
and
you
that
he
is
trying
either
to
please
or
terrify
you
into
compliance
there
is
an
end
at
once
to
that
kind
of
eloquence
which
owes
its
effect
to
the
force
of
truth
and
to
your
confidence
in
the
sincerity
of
the
speaker
it
was
however
to
the
confidence
inspired
by
the
earnestness
and
simplicity
of
his
manner
that
fox
was
indebted
for
more
than
half
the
effect
of
his
speeches
some
others
might
possess
nearly
as
much
information
as
exact
a
knowledge
of
the
situation
and
interests
of
the
country
but
they
wanted
that
zeal
that
animation
that
enthusiasm
that
deep
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
subject
which
removes
all
doubt
or
suspicion
from
the
minds
of
the
hearers
and
communicates
its
own
warmth
to
every
breast
we
may
convince
by
argument
alone
but
it
is
by
the
interest
we
discover
in
the
success
of
our
reasonings
that
we
persuade
others
to
feel
and
act
with
us
there
are
two
circumstances
which
fox
speeches
and
lord
chatham
had
in
common
they
are
alike
distinguished
by
a
kind
of
plain
downright
common
sense
and
by
the
vehemence
of
their
manner
but
still
there
is
a
great
difference
between
them
in
both
these
respects
fox
in
his
opinions
was
governed
by
facts
chatham
was
more
influenced
by
the
feelings
of
others
respecting
those
facts
fox
endeavoured
to
find
out
what
the
consequences
of
any
measure
would
be
chatham
attended
more
to
what
people
would
think
of
it
fox
appealed
to
the
practical
reason
of
mankind
chatham
to
popular
prejudice
the
one
repelled
the
encroachments
of
power
by
supplying
his
hearers
with
arguments
against
it
the
other
by
rousing
their
passions
and
arming
their
resentment
against
those
who
would
rob
them
of
their
birthright
their
vehemence
and
impetuosity
arose
also
from
very
different
feelings
in
chatham
it
was
pride
passion
impatience
of
control
a
determination
to
have
his
own
way
to
carry
everything
before
him
in
fox
it
was
pure
good
nature
a
sincere
love
of
truth
an
ardent
attachment
to
what
he
conceived
to
be
right
all
anxious
concern
for
the
welfare
and
liberties
of
mankind
or
if
we
suppose
that
ambition
had
taken
a
strong
hold
of
both
their
minds
yet
their
ambition
was
of
a
very
different
kind
in
the
one
it
was
the
love
of
power
in
the
other
it
was
the
love
of
fame
nothing
can
be
more
opposite
than
these
two
principles
both
in
their
origin
and
tendency
the
one
originates
in
a
selfish
haughty
domineering
spirit
the
other
in
a
social
and
generous
sensibility
desirous
of
the
love
and
esteem
of
others
and
anxiously
bent
upon
gaining
merited
applause
the
one
grasps
at
immediate
power
by
any
means
within
its
reach
the
other
if
it
does
not
square
its
actions
by
the
rules
of
virtue
at
least
refers
them
to
a
standard
which
comes
the
nearest
to
it
the
disinterested
applause
of
our
country
and
the
enlightened
judgment
of
posterity
the
love
of
fame
is
consistent
with
the
steadiest
attachment
to
principle
and
indeed
strengthens
and
supports
it
whereas
the
love
of
power
where
this
is
the
ruling
passion
requires
the
sacrifice
of
principle
at
every
turn
and
is
inconsistent
even
with
the
shadow
of
it
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
fox
had
no
love
of
power
or
chatham
no
love
of
fame
this
would
be
reversing
all
we
know
of
human
nature
but
that
the
one
principle
predominated
in
the
one
and
the
other
in
the
other
my
reader
will
do
me
great
injustice
if
he
supposes
that
in
attempting
to
describe
the
characters
of
different
speakers
by
contrasting
their
general
qualities
i
mean
anything
beyond
the
or
but
it
is
necessary
to
describe
those
qualities
simply
and
in
the
abstract
in
order
to
make
the
distinction
intelligible
chatham
resented
any
attack
made
upon
the
cause
of
liberty
of
which
he
was
the
avowed
champion
as
an
indignity
offered
to
himself
fox
felt
it
as
a
stain
upon
the
honour
of
his
country
and
as
an
injury
to
the
rights
of
his
the
one
was
swayed
by
his
own
passions
and
purposes
with
very
little
regard
to
the
consequences
the
sensibility
of
the
other
was
roused
and
his
passions
kindled
into
a
generous
flame
by
a
real
interest
in
whatever
related
to
the
welfare
of
mankind
and
by
an
intense
and
earnest
contemplation
of
the
consequences
of
the
measures
he
opposed
it
was
this
union
of
the
zeal
of
the
patriot
with
the
enlightened
knowledge
of
the
statesman
that
gave
to
the
eloquence
of
fox
its
more
than
mortal
energy
that
warmed
expanded
penetrated
every
bosom
he
relied
on
the
force
of
truth
and
nature
alone
the
refinements
of
philosophy
the
pomp
and
pageantry
of
the
imagination
were
forgotten
or
seemed
light
and
frivolous
the
fate
of
nations
the
welfare
of
millions
hung
suspended
as
he
spoke
a
torrent
of
manly
eloquence
poured
from
his
heart
bore
down
everything
in
its
course
and
surprised
into
a
momentary
sense
of
human
feeling
the
breathing
corpses
the
puppets
the
stuffed
figures
the
flexible
machinery
the
and
dumb
things
of
a
court
i
find
i
do
not
know
how
the
reader
feels
that
it
is
difficult
to
write
a
character
of
fox
without
running
into
insipidity
or
extravagance
and
the
reason
of
this
is
there
are
no
splendid
contrasts
no
striking
irregularities
no
curious
distinctions
to
work
upon
no
frieze
buttress
nor
coigne
of
for
the
imagination
to
take
hold
of
it
was
a
plain
marble
slab
inscribed
in
plain
legible
characters
without
either
hieroglyphics
or
carving
there
was
the
same
directness
and
manly
simplicity
in
everything
that
he
did
the
whole
of
his
character
may
indeed
be
summed
up
in
two
words
strength
and
simplicity
fox
was
in
the
class
of
common
men
but
he
was
the
first
in
that
class
though
it
is
easy
to
describe
the
differences
of
things
nothing
is
more
difficult
than
to
describe
their
degrees
or
quantities
in
what
i
am
going
to
say
i
hope
i
shall
not
be
suspected
of
a
design
to
his
powers
of
mind
when
in
fact
i
am
only
trying
to
ascertain
their
nature
and
direction
the
degree
and
extent
to
which
he
possessed
them
can
only
be
known
by
reading
or
indeed
by
having
heard
his
speeches
his
mind
as
i
have
already
said
was
i
conceive
purely
and
having
said
this
i
have
i
believe
said
all
but
perhaps
it
will
be
necessary
to
explain
a
little
farther
what
i
mean
i
mean
then
that
his
memory
was
in
an
extraordinary
degree
tenacious
of
facts
that
they
were
crowded
together
in
his
mind
without
the
least
perplexity
or
confusion
that
there
was
no
chain
of
consequences
too
vast
for
his
powers
of
comprehension
that
the
different
parts
and
ramifications
of
his
subject
were
never
so
involved
and
intricate
but
that
they
were
easily
disentangled
in
the
clear
prism
of
his
understanding
the
basis
of
his
wisdom
was
experience
he
not
only
knew
what
had
happened
but
by
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
real
state
of
things
he
could
always
tell
what
in
the
common
course
of
events
would
happen
in
future
the
force
of
his
mind
was
exerted
on
facts
as
long
as
he
could
lean
directly
upon
these
as
long
as
he
had
the
actual
objects
to
refer
to
to
steady
himself
by
he
could
analyse
he
could
combine
he
could
compare
and
reason
upon
them
with
the
utmost
exactness
but
he
could
not
reason
them
he
was
what
is
understood
by
a
reasoner
he
was
better
acquainted
with
the
concrete
masses
of
things
their
substantial
forms
and
practical
connections
than
with
their
abstract
nature
or
general
definitions
he
was
a
man
of
extensive
information
of
sound
knowledge
and
clear
understanding
rather
than
the
acute
observer
or
profound
thinker
he
was
the
man
of
business
the
accomplished
statesman
rather
than
the
philosopher
his
reasonings
were
generally
speaking
calculations
of
certain
positive
results
which
the
being
given
must
follow
as
matters
of
course
rather
than
unexpected
and
remote
truths
drawn
from
a
deep
insight
into
human
nature
and
the
subtle
application
of
general
principles
to
particular
cases
they
consisted
chiefly
in
the
detail
and
combination
of
a
vast
number
of
items
in
an
account
worked
by
the
known
rules
of
political
arithmetic
not
in
the
discovery
of
bold
comprehensive
and
original
theorems
in
the
science
they
were
rather
acts
of
memory
of
continued
attention
of
a
power
of
bringing
all
his
ideas
to
bear
at
once
upon
a
single
point
than
of
reason
or
invention
he
was
the
attentive
observer
who
watches
the
various
effects
and
successive
movements
of
a
machine
already
constructed
and
can
tell
how
to
manage
it
while
it
goes
on
as
it
has
always
done
but
who
knows
little
or
nothing
of
the
principles
on
which
it
is
constructed
nor
how
to
set
it
right
if
it
becomes
disordered
except
by
the
most
common
and
obvious
expedients
burke
was
to
fox
what
the
geometrician
is
to
the
mechanic
much
has
been
said
of
the
mind
of
fox
the
same
epithet
has
been
applied
to
burke
till
it
has
become
proverbial
it
has
i
think
been
applied
without
much
reason
to
either
fox
wanted
the
scientific
part
burke
wanted
the
practical
fox
had
too
little
imagination
burke
had
too
much
that
is
he
was
careless
of
facts
and
was
led
away
by
his
passions
to
look
at
one
side
of
a
question
only
he
had
not
that
fine
sensibility
to
outward
impressions
that
nice
of
circumstances
which
is
necessary
to
the
consummate
politician
indeed
his
wisdom
was
more
that
of
the
legislator
than
of
the
active
statesman
they
both
tried
their
strength
in
the
bow
of
politicians
the
french
revolution
and
they
were
both
foiled
fox
indeed
foretold
the
success
of
the
french
in
combating
with
foreign
powers
but
this
was
no
more
than
what
every
friend
of
the
liberty
of
france
foresaw
or
foretold
as
well
as
he
all
those
on
the
same
side
of
the
question
were
inspired
with
the
same
sagacity
on
the
subject
burke
on
the
other
hand
seems
to
have
been
beforehand
with
the
public
in
foreboding
the
internal
disorders
that
would
attend
the
revolution
and
its
ultimate
failure
but
then
it
is
at
least
a
question
whether
he
did
not
make
good
his
own
predictions
and
certainly
he
saw
into
the
causes
and
connection
of
events
much
more
clearly
after
they
had
happened
than
before
he
was
however
undoubtedly
a
profound
commentator
on
that
apocalyptical
chapter
in
the
history
of
human
nature
which
i
do
not
think
fox
was
whether
led
to
it
by
the
events
or
not
he
saw
thoroughly
into
the
principles
that
operated
to
produce
them
and
he
pointed
them
out
to
others
in
a
manner
which
could
not
be
mistaken
i
can
conceive
of
burke
as
the
genius
of
the
storm
perched
over
paris
the
centre
and
focus
of
anarchy
so
he
would
have
us
believe
hovering
mighty
wings
outspread
over
the
abyss
and
rendering
it
pregnant
watching
the
passions
of
men
gradually
unfolding
themselves
in
new
situations
penetrating
those
hidden
motives
which
hurried
them
from
one
extreme
into
another
arranging
and
analysing
the
principles
that
alternately
pervaded
the
vast
chaotic
mass
and
extracting
the
elements
of
order
and
the
cement
of
social
life
from
the
decomposition
of
all
society
while
charles
fox
in
the
meantime
dogged
the
heels
of
the
allies
all
the
while
calling
out
to
them
to
stop
with
his
sutler
bag
his
muster
roll
and
army
estimates
at
his
back
he
said
you
have
only
fifty
thousand
troops
the
enemy
have
a
hundred
thousand
this
place
is
dismantled
it
can
make
no
resistance
your
troops
were
beaten
last
year
they
must
therefore
be
disheartened
this
this
is
excellent
sense
and
sound
reasoning
but
i
do
not
see
what
it
has
to
do
with
philosophy
but
why
was
it
necessary
that
fox
should
be
a
philosopher
why
in
the
first
place
burke
was
a
philosopher
and
fox
to
keep
up
with
him
must
be
so
too
in
the
second
place
it
was
necessary
in
order
that
his
indiscreet
admirers
who
have
no
idea
of
greatness
but
as
it
consists
in
certain
names
and
pompous
titles
might
be
able
to
talk
big
about
their
patron
it
is
a
bad
compliment
we
pay
to
our
idol
when
we
endeavour
to
make
him
out
something
different
from
himself
it
shows
that
we
are
not
satisfied
with
what
he
is
i
have
heard
it
said
that
he
had
as
much
imagination
as
burke
to
this
extravagant
assertion
i
shall
make
what
i
conceive
to
be
a
very
cautious
and
moderate
answer
that
burke
was
as
superior
to
fox
in
this
respect
as
fox
perhaps
was
to
the
first
person
you
would
meet
in
the
street
there
is
in
fact
hardly
an
instance
of
imagination
to
be
met
with
in
any
of
his
speeches
what
there
is
is
of
the
rhetorical
kind
i
may
however
be
wrong
he
might
excel
as
much
in
profound
thought
and
richness
of
fancy
as
he
did
in
other
things
though
i
can
not
perceive
it
however
when
any
one
publishes
a
book
called
the
beauties
of
fox
containing
the
original
reflections
brilliant
passages
lofty
metaphors
to
be
found
in
his
speeches
without
the
detail
or
connection
i
shall
be
very
ready
to
give
the
point
up
in
logic
fox
was
inferior
to
pitt
indeed
in
all
the
formalities
of
eloquence
in
which
the
latter
excelled
as
much
as
he
was
deficient
in
the
soul
of
substance
when
i
say
that
pitt
was
superior
to
fox
in
logic
i
mean
that
he
excelled
him
in
the
formal
division
of
the
subject
in
always
keeping
it
in
view
as
far
as
he
chose
in
being
able
to
detect
any
deviation
from
it
in
others
in
the
management
of
his
general
topics
in
being
aware
of
the
mood
and
figure
in
which
the
argument
must
move
with
all
its
nonessentials
dilemmas
and
alternatives
in
never
committing
himself
nor
ever
suffering
his
antagonist
to
occupy
an
inch
of
the
plainest
ground
but
under
cover
of
a
syllogism
he
had
more
of
dazzling
fence
of
argument
as
it
has
been
called
he
was
in
short
better
at
his
weapon
but
then
unfortunately
it
was
only
a
dagger
of
lath
that
the
wind
could
turn
aside
whereas
fox
wore
a
good
trusty
blade
of
solid
metal
and
real
execution
i
shall
not
trouble
myself
to
inquire
whether
fox
was
a
man
of
strict
virtue
and
principle
or
in
other
words
how
far
he
was
one
of
those
who
screw
themselves
up
to
a
certain
pitch
of
ideal
perfection
who
as
it
were
set
themselves
in
the
stocks
of
morality
and
make
mouths
at
their
own
situation
he
was
not
one
of
that
tribe
and
shall
not
be
tried
by
their
ordinances
but
he
was
endowed
with
one
of
the
most
excellent
natures
that
ever
fell
to
the
lot
of
any
of
creatures
it
has
been
said
that
honest
man
the
noblest
work
of
god
there
is
indeed
a
purity
a
rectitude
an
integrity
of
heart
a
freedom
from
every
selfish
bias
and
sinister
motive
a
manly
simplicity
and
noble
disinterestedness
of
feeling
which
is
in
my
opinion
to
be
preferred
before
every
other
gift
of
nature
or
art
there
is
a
greatness
of
soul
that
is
superior
to
all
the
brilliancy
of
the
understanding
this
strength
of
moral
character
which
is
not
only
a
more
valuable
but
a
rarer
quality
than
strength
of
understanding
as
we
are
oftener
led
astray
by
the
narrowness
of
our
feelings
than
want
of
knowledge
fox
possessed
in
the
highest
degree
he
was
superior
to
every
kind
of
jealousy
of
suspicion
of
malevolence
to
every
narrow
and
sordid
motive
he
was
perfectly
above
every
species
of
duplicity
of
low
art
and
cunning
he
judged
of
everything
in
the
downright
sincerity
of
his
nature
without
being
able
to
impose
upon
himself
by
any
hollow
disguise
or
to
lend
his
support
to
anything
unfair
or
dishonourable
he
had
an
innate
love
of
truth
of
justice
of
probity
of
whatever
was
generous
or
liberal
neither
his
education
nor
his
connections
nor
his
situation
in
life
nor
the
low
intrigues
and
virulence
of
party
could
ever
alter
the
simplicity
of
his
taste
nor
the
candid
openness
of
his
nature
there
was
an
elastic
force
about
his
heart
a
freshness
of
social
feeling
a
warm
glowing
humanity
which
remained
unimpaired
to
the
last
he
was
by
nature
a
gentleman
by
this
i
mean
that
he
felt
a
certain
deference
and
respect
for
the
person
of
every
man
he
had
an
unaffected
frankness
and
benignity
in
his
behaviour
to
others
the
utmost
liberality
in
judging
of
their
conduct
and
motives
a
refined
humanity
constitutes
the
character
of
a
gentleman
he
was
the
true
friend
of
his
country
as
far
as
it
is
possible
for
a
statesman
to
be
so
but
his
love
of
his
country
did
not
consist
in
his
hatred
of
the
rest
of
mankind
i
shall
conclude
this
account
by
repeating
what
burke
said
of
him
at
a
time
when
his
testimony
was
of
the
most
value
his
great
and
masterly
understanding
he
joined
the
utmost
possible
degree
of
moderation
he
was
of
the
most
artless
candid
open
and
benevolent
disposition
disinterested
in
the
extreme
of
a
temper
mild
and
placable
even
to
a
fault
and
without
one
drop
of
gall
in
his
constitution
footnote
there
is
an
admirable
judicious
and
truly
useful
remark
in
the
preface
to
spenser
not
by
johnson
for
he
left
spenser
out
of
his
poets
but
by
upton
that
the
question
was
not
whether
a
better
poem
might
not
have
been
written
on
a
different
plan
but
whether
spenser
would
have
written
a
better
one
on
a
different
plan
i
wish
to
apply
this
to
fox
manner
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
his
manner
was
the
best
possible
for
that
would
be
to
say
that
he
was
the
greatest
man
conceivable
but
that
it
was
the
best
for
him
essay
xiv
on
the
character
of
pitt
the
character
of
pitt
was
perhaps
one
of
the
most
singular
that
ever
existed
with
few
talents
and
fewer
virtues
he
acquired
and
preserved
in
one
of
the
most
trying
situations
and
in
spite
of
all
opposition
the
highest
reputation
for
the
possession
of
every
moral
excellence
and
as
having
carried
the
attainments
of
eloquence
and
wisdom
as
far
as
human
abilities
could
go
this
he
did
strange
as
it
appears
by
a
negation
together
with
the
common
virtues
of
the
common
vices
of
human
nature
and
by
the
complete
negation
of
every
other
talent
that
might
interfere
with
the
only
one
which
he
possessed
in
a
supreme
degree
and
which
indeed
may
be
made
to
include
the
appearance
of
all
others
an
artful
use
of
words
and
a
certain
dexterity
of
logical
arrangement
in
these
alone
his
power
consisted
and
the
defect
of
all
other
qualities
which
usually
constitute
greatness
contributed
to
the
more
complete
success
of
these
having
no
strong
feelings
no
distinct
perceptions
his
mind
having
no
link
as
it
were
to
connect
it
with
the
world
of
external
nature
every
subject
presented
to
him
nothing
more
than
a
on
which
he
was
at
liberty
to
lay
whatever
colouring
of
language
he
pleased
having
no
general
principles
no
comprehensive
views
of
things
no
moral
habits
of
thinking
no
system
of
action
there
was
nothing
to
hinder
him
from
pursuing
any
particular
purpose
by
any
means
that
offered
having
never
any
plan
he
could
not
be
convicted
of
inconsistency
and
his
own
pride
and
obstinacy
were
the
only
rules
of
his
conduct
having
no
insight
into
human
nature
no
sympathy
with
the
passions
of
men
or
apprehension
of
their
real
designs
he
seemed
perfectly
insensible
to
the
consequences
of
things
and
would
believe
nothing
till
it
actually
happened
the
fog
and
haze
in
which
he
saw
everything
communicated
itself
to
others
and
the
total
indistinctness
and
uncertainty
of
his
own
ideas
tended
to
confound
the
perceptions
of
his
hearers
more
effectually
than
the
most
ingenious
misrepresentation
could
have
done
indeed
in
defending
his
conduct
he
never
seemed
to
consider
himself
as
at
all
responsible
for
the
success
of
his
measures
or
to
suppose
that
future
events
were
in
our
own
power
but
that
as
the
schemes
might
fail
and
there
was
no
providing
against
all
possible
contingencies
this
was
a
sufficient
excuse
for
our
plunging
at
once
into
any
dangerous
or
absurd
enterprise
without
the
least
regard
to
consequences
his
reserved
logic
confined
itself
solely
to
the
and
the
and
he
appeared
to
regard
the
and
the
only
foundation
of
moral
prudence
or
political
wisdom
as
beneath
the
notice
of
a
profound
statesman
as
if
the
pride
of
the
human
intellect
were
concerned
in
never
entrusting
itself
with
subjects
where
it
may
be
compelled
to
acknowledge
its
weakness
from
his
manner
of
reasoning
he
seemed
not
to
have
believed
that
the
truth
of
his
statements
depended
on
the
reality
of
the
facts
but
that
the
things
depended
on
the
order
in
which
he
arranged
them
in
words
you
would
not
suppose
him
to
be
agitating
a
serious
question
which
had
real
grounds
to
go
upon
but
to
be
declaiming
upon
an
imaginary
thesis
proposed
as
an
exercise
in
the
schools
he
never
set
himself
to
examine
the
force
of
the
objections
that
were
brought
against
his
measures
or
attempted
to
establish
these
upon
clear
solid
grounds
of
his
own
but
constantly
contented
himself
with
first
gravely
stating
the
logical
form
or
dilemma
to
which
the
question
reduced
itself
and
then
after
having
declared
his
opinion
proceeded
to
amuse
his
hearers
by
a
series
of
rhetorical
commonplaces
connected
together
in
grave
sonorous
and
elaborately
constructed
periods
without
ever
showing
their
real
application
to
the
subject
in
dispute
thus
if
any
member
of
the
opposition
disapproved
of
any
measure
and
enforced
his
objections
by
pointing
out
the
many
evils
with
which
it
was
fraught
or
the
difficulties
attending
its
execution
his
only
answer
was
it
was
true
there
might
be
inconveniences
attending
the
measure
proposed
but
we
were
to
remember
that
every
expedient
that
could
be
devised
might
be
said
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
choice
of
difficulties
and
that
all
that
human
prudence
could
do
was
to
consider
on
which
side
the
advantages
lay
that
for
his
part
he
conceived
that
the
present
measure
was
attended
with
more
advantages
and
fewer
disadvantages
than
any
other
that
could
be
adopted
that
if
we
were
diverted
from
our
object
by
every
appearance
of
difficulty
the
wheels
of
government
would
be
clogged
by
endless
delays
and
imaginary
grievances
that
most
of
the
objections
made
to
the
measure
appeared
to
him
to
be
trivial
others
of
them
unfounded
and
improbable
or
that
if
a
scheme
free
from
all
these
objections
could
be
proposed
it
might
after
all
prove
inefficient
while
in
the
meantime
a
material
object
remained
unprovided
for
or
the
opportunity
of
action
was
lost
this
mode
of
reasoning
is
admirably
described
by
hobbes
in
speaking
of
the
writings
of
some
of
the
schoolmen
of
whom
he
says
that
had
learned
the
trick
of
imposing
what
they
list
upon
their
readers
and
declining
the
force
of
true
reason
by
verbal
forks
that
is
distinctions
which
signify
nothing
but
serve
only
to
astonish
the
multitude
of
ignorant
men
that
what
i
have
here
stated
comprehends
the
whole
force
of
his
mind
which
consisted
solely
in
this
evasive
dexterity
and
perplexing
formality
assisted
by
a
copiousness
of
words
and
commonplace
topics
will
i
think
be
evident
in
any
one
who
carefully
looks
over
his
speeches
undazzled
by
the
reputation
or
personal
influence
of
the
speaker
it
will
be
in
vain
to
look
in
them
for
any
of
the
common
proofs
of
human
genius
or
wisdom
he
has
not
left
behind
him
a
single
memorable
saying
not
one
profound
maxim
one
solid
observation
one
forcible
description
one
beautiful
thought
one
humorous
picture
one
affecting
sentiment
he
has
made
no
addition
whatever
to
the
stock
of
human
knowledge
he
did
not
possess
any
one
of
those
faculties
which
contribute
to
the
instruction
and
delight
of
mankind
depth
of
understanding
imagination
sensibility
wit
vivacity
clear
and
solid
judgment
but
it
may
be
asked
if
these
qualities
are
not
to
be
found
in
him
where
are
we
to
look
for
them
and
i
may
be
required
to
point
out
instances
of
them
i
shall
answer
then
that
he
had
none
of
the
profound
legislative
wisdom
piercing
sagacity
or
rich
impetuous
imagination
of
burke
the
manly
eloquence
strong
sense
exact
knowledge
vehemence
and
natural
simplicity
of
fox
the
ease
brilliancy
and
acuteness
of
sheridan
it
is
not
merely
that
he
had
not
all
these
qualities
in
the
degree
that
they
were
severally
possessed
by
his
rivals
but
he
had
not
any
of
them
in
any
striking
degree
his
reasoning
is
a
technical
arrangement
of
unmeaning
commonplaces
his
eloquence
merely
rhetorical
his
style
monotonous
and
artificial
if
he
could
pretend
to
any
one
excellence
in
an
eminent
degree
it
was
to
taste
in
composition
there
is
certainly
nothing
low
nothing
puerile
nothing
or
abrupt
in
his
speeches
there
is
a
kind
of
faultless
regularity
pervading
them
throughout
but
in
the
confined
mechanical
passive
mode
of
eloquence
which
he
adopted
it
seemed
rather
more
difficult
to
commit
errors
than
to
avoid
them
a
man
who
is
determined
never
to
move
out
of
the
beaten
road
can
not
lose
his
way
however
habit
joined
to
the
peculiar
mechanical
memory
which
he
possessed
carried
this
correctness
to
a
degree
which
in
an
extemporaneous
speaker
was
almost
miraculous
he
perhaps
hardly
ever
uttered
a
sentence
that
was
not
perfectly
regular
and
connected
in
this
respect
he
not
only
had
the
advantage
over
his
own
contemporaries
but
perhaps
no
one
that
ever
lived
equalled
him
in
this
singular
faculty
but
for
this
he
would
always
have
passed
for
a
common
man
and
to
this
the
constant
sameness
and
if
i
may
so
say
vulgarity
of
his
ideas
must
have
contributed
not
a
little
as
there
was
nothing
to
distract
his
mind
from
this
one
object
of
his
unintermitted
attention
and
as
even
in
his
choice
of
words
he
never
aimed
at
anything
more
than
a
certain
general
propriety
and
stately
uniformity
of
style
his
talents
were
exactly
fitted
for
the
situation
in
which
he
was
placed
where
it
was
his
business
not
to
overcome
others
but
to
avoid
being
overcome
he
was
able
to
baffle
opposition
not
from
strength
or
firmness
but
from
the
evasive
ambiguity
and
impalpable
nature
of
his
resistance
which
gave
no
hold
to
the
rude
grasp
of
his
opponents
no
force
could
bind
the
loose
phantom
and
his
mind
though
matchless
and
his
pride
humbled
by
such
rebuke
soon
rose
from
defeat
unhurt
in
its
liquid
texture
mortal
wound
receiv
no
more
than
can
the
fluid
air
footnotes
one
instance
may
serve
as
an
example
for
all
the
rest
when
fox
last
summer
predicted
the
failure
of
the
new
confederacy
against
france
from
a
consideration
of
the
circumstances
and
relative
situation
of
both
parties
that
is
from
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
actual
state
of
things
pitt
contented
himself
with
answering
and
as
in
the
blindness
of
his
infatuation
he
seemed
to
think
quite
satisfactorily
he
could
not
assent
to
the
honourable
gentleman
reasoning
for
that
it
went
to
this
that
we
were
never
to
attempt
to
mend
the
situation
of
our
affairs
because
in
so
doing
we
might
possibly
make
them
worse
no
it
was
not
on
account
of
this
abstract
possibility
in
human
affairs
or
because
we
were
not
absolutely
sure
of
succeeding
for
that
any
child
might
know
but
because
it
was
in
the
highest
degree
probable
or
certain
that
the
scheme
would
fail
and
leave
us
in
a
worse
situation
than
we
were
before
that
fox
disapproved
of
the
attempt
there
is
in
this
a
degree
of
weakness
and
imbecility
a
defect
of
understanding
bordering
on
idiotism
a
fundamental
ignorance
of
the
first
principles
of
human
reason
and
prudence
that
in
a
great
minister
is
utterly
astonishing
and
almost
incredible
nothing
could
ever
drive
him
out
of
his
dull
forms
and
naked
generalities
which
as
they
are
susceptible
neither
of
degree
nor
variation
are
therefore
equally
applicable
to
every
emergency
that
can
happen
and
in
the
most
critical
aspect
of
affairs
he
saw
nothing
but
the
same
flimsy
web
of
remote
possibilities
and
metaphysical
uncertainty
in
his
mind
the
wholesome
pulp
of
practical
wisdom
and
salutary
advice
was
immediately
converted
into
the
dry
chaff
and
husks
of
a
miserable
logic
i
do
remember
one
passage
which
has
some
meaning
in
it
at
the
time
of
the
regency
bill
speaking
of
the
proposal
to
take
the
servants
from
him
he
says
must
that
great
personage
feel
when
he
waked
from
the
trance
of
his
faculties
and
asked
for
his
attendants
if
he
were
told
that
his
subjects
had
taken
advantage
of
his
momentary
absence
of
mind
and
stripped
him
of
the
symbols
of
his
personal
elevation
there
is
some
grandeur
in
this
his
admirers
should
have
it
inscribed
in
letters
of
gold
for
they
will
not
find
another
instance
of
the
same
kind
i
will
only
add
that
it
is
the
property
of
true
genius
to
force
the
admiration
even
of
enemies
no
one
was
ever
hated
or
envied
for
his
powers
of
mind
if
others
were
convinced
of
their
real
excellence
the
jealousy
and
uneasiness
produced
in
the
mind
by
the
display
of
superior
talents
almost
always
arises
from
a
suspicion
that
there
is
some
trick
or
deception
in
the
case
and
that
we
are
imposed
on
by
an
appearance
of
what
is
not
really
there
true
warmth
and
vigour
communicate
warmth
and
vigour
and
we
are
no
longer
inclined
to
dispute
the
inspiration
of
the
oracle
when
we
feel
the
in
our
own
bosoms
but
when
without
gaining
any
new
light
or
heat
we
only
find
our
ideas
thrown
into
perplexity
and
confusion
by
an
art
that
we
can
not
comprehend
this
is
a
kind
of
superiority
which
must
always
be
painful
and
can
be
cordially
admitted
for
this
reason
the
extraordinary
talents
of
pitt
were
always
viewed
except
by
those
of
his
own
party
with
a
sort
of
jealousy
and
acknowledged
while
those
of
his
rivals
were
admitted
by
all
parties
in
the
most
unreserved
manner
and
carried
by
acclamation
essay
xv
on
the
character
of
lord
chatham
lord
chatham
genius
burnt
brightest
at
the
last
the
spark
of
liberty
which
had
lain
concealed
and
dormant
buried
under
the
dirt
and
rubbish
of
state
intrigue
and
vulgar
faction
now
met
with
congenial
matter
and
kindled
up
flame
of
sacred
vehemence
in
his
breast
it
burst
forth
with
a
fury
and
a
splendour
that
might
have
awed
the
world
and
made
kings
tremble
he
spoke
as
a
man
should
speak
because
he
felt
as
a
man
should
feel
in
such
circumstances
he
came
forward
as
the
advocate
of
liberty
as
the
defender
of
the
rights
of
his
as
the
enemy
of
tyranny
as
the
friend
of
his
country
and
of
mankind
he
did
not
stand
up
to
make
a
vain
display
of
his
talents
but
to
discharge
a
duty
to
maintain
that
cause
which
lay
nearest
to
his
heart
to
preserve
the
ark
of
the
british
constitution
from
every
sacrilegious
touch
as
the
of
his
calling
with
a
pious
zeal
the
feelings
and
the
rights
of
englishmen
were
enshrined
in
his
heart
and
with
their
united
force
braced
every
nerve
possessed
every
faculty
and
communicated
warmth
and
vital
energy
to
every
part
of
his
being
the
whole
man
moved
under
this
impulse
he
felt
the
cause
of
liberty
as
his
own
he
resented
every
injury
done
to
her
as
an
injury
to
himself
and
every
attempt
to
defend
it
as
an
insult
upon
his
understanding
he
did
not
stay
to
dispute
about
words
about
nice
distinctions
about
trifling
forms
be
laughed
at
the
little
attempts
of
little
retailers
of
logic
to
entangle
him
in
senseless
argument
he
did
not
come
there
as
to
a
debating
club
or
law
court
to
start
questions
and
hunt
them
down
to
wind
and
unwind
the
web
of
sophistry
to
pick
out
the
threads
and
untie
every
knot
with
scrupulous
exactness
to
bandy
logic
with
every
pretender
to
a
paradox
to
examine
to
sift
evidence
to
dissect
a
doubt
and
halve
a
scruple
to
weigh
folly
and
knavery
in
scales
together
and
see
on
which
side
the
balance
preponderated
to
prove
that
liberty
truth
virtue
and
justice
were
good
things
or
that
slavery
and
corruption
were
bad
things
he
did
not
try
to
prove
those
truths
which
did
not
require
any
proof
but
to
make
others
feel
them
with
the
same
force
that
he
did
and
to
tear
off
the
flimsy
disguises
with
which
the
sycophants
of
power
attempted
to
cover
them
the
business
of
an
orator
is
not
to
convince
but
persuade
not
to
inform
but
to
rouse
the
mind
to
build
upon
the
habitual
prejudices
of
mankind
for
reason
of
itself
will
do
nothing
and
to
add
feeling
to
prejudice
and
action
to
feeling
there
is
nothing
new
or
curious
or
profound
in
lord
chatham
speeches
all
is
obvious
and
common
there
is
nothing
but
what
we
already
knew
or
might
have
found
out
for
ourselves
we
see
nothing
but
the
familiar
everyday
face
of
nature
we
are
always
in
broad
daylight
but
then
there
is
the
same
difference
between
our
own
conceptions
of
things
and
his
representation
of
them
as
there
is
between
the
same
objects
seen
on
a
dull
cloudy
day
or
in
the
blaze
of
sunshine
his
common
sense
has
the
effect
of
inspiration
he
electrifies
his
hearers
not
by
the
novelty
of
his
ideas
but
by
their
force
and
intensity
he
has
the
same
ideas
as
other
men
but
he
has
them
in
a
thousand
times
greater
clearness
and
strength
and
vividness
perhaps
there
is
no
man
so
poorly
furnished
with
thoughts
and
feelings
but
that
if
he
could
recollect
all
that
he
knew
and
had
all
his
ideas
at
perfect
command
he
would
be
able
to
confound
the
puny
arts
of
the
most
dexterous
sophist
that
pretended
to
make
a
dupe
of
his
understanding
but
in
the
mind
of
chatham
the
great
substantial
truths
of
common
sense
the
leading
maxims
of
the
constitution
the
real
interests
and
general
feelings
of
mankind
were
in
a
manner
embodied
he
comprehended
the
whole
of
his
subject
at
a
single
glance
everything
was
firmly
riveted
to
its
place
there
was
no
feebleness
no
forgetfulness
no
pause
no
distraction
the
ardour
of
his
mind
overcame
every
obstacle
and
he
crushed
the
objections
of
his
adversaries
as
we
crush
an
insect
under
our
feet
his
imagination
was
of
the
same
character
with
his
understanding
and
was
under
the
same
guidance
whenever
he
gave
way
to
it
it
an
eagle
flight
forth
and
right
on
but
it
did
not
become
enamoured
of
its
own
emotion
wantoning
in
giddy
circles
or
with
supreme
dominion
through
the
azure
deep
of
air
it
never
forgot
its
errand
but
went
straight
forward
like
an
arrow
to
its
mark
with
an
unerring
aim
it
was
his
servant
not
his
master
to
be
a
great
orator
does
not
require
the
highest
faculties
of
the
human
mind
but
it
requires
the
highest
exertion
of
the
common
faculties
of
our
nature
he
has
no
occasion
to
dive
into
the
depths
of
science
or
to
soar
aloft
on
angels
wings
he
keeps
upon
the
surface
he
stands
firm
upon
the
ground
but
his
form
is
majestic
and
his
eye
sees
far
and
near
he
moves
among
his
fellows
but
he
moves
among
them
as
a
giant
among
common
men
he
has
no
need
to
read
the
heavens
to
unfold
the
system
of
the
universe
or
create
new
worlds
for
the
delighted
fancy
to
dwell
in
it
is
enough
that
he
see
things
as
they
are
that
he
knows
and
feels
and
remembers
the
common
circumstances
and
daily
transactions
that
are
passing
in
the
world
around
him
he
is
not
raised
above
others
by
being
superior
to
the
common
interests
prejudices
and
passions
of
mankind
but
by
feeling
them
in
a
more
intense
degree
than
they
do
force
then
is
the
sole
characteristic
excellence
of
an
orator
it
is
almost
the
only
one
that
can
be
of
any
service
to
him
refinement
depth
elevation
delicacy
originality
ingenuity
invention
are
not
wanted
he
must
appeal
to
the
sympathies
of
human
nature
and
whatever
is
not
founded
in
these
is
foreign
to
his
purpose
he
does
not
create
he
can
only
imitate
or
echo
back
the
public
sentiment
his
object
is
to
call
up
the
feelings
of
the
human
breast
but
he
can
not
call
up
what
is
not
already
there
the
first
duty
of
an
orator
is
to
be
understood
by
every
one
but
it
is
evident
that
what
all
can
understand
is
not
in
itself
difficult
of
comprehension
he
can
not
add
anything
to
the
materials
afforded
him
by
the
knowledge
and
experience
of
others
lord
chatham
in
his
speeches
was
neither
philosopher
nor
poet
as
to
the
latter
the
difference
between
poetry
and
eloquence
i
take
to
be
this
that
the
object
of
the
one
is
to
delight
the
imagination
that
of
the
other
to
impel
the
will
the
one
ought
to
enrich
and
feed
the
mind
itself
with
tenderness
and
beauty
the
other
furnishes
it
with
motives
of
action
the
one
seeks
to
give
immediate
pleasure
to
make
the
mind
dwell
with
rapture
on
its
own
workings
it
is
to
itself
end
and
use
the
other
endeavours
to
call
up
such
images
as
will
produce
the
strongest
effect
upon
the
mind
and
makes
use
of
the
passions
only
as
instruments
to
attain
a
particular
purpose
the
poet
lulls
and
soothes
the
mind
into
a
forgetfulness
of
itself
and
it
in
elysium
the
orator
strives
to
awaken
it
to
a
sense
of
its
real
interests
and
to
make
it
feel
the
necessity
of
taking
the
most
effectual
means
for
securing
them
the
one
dwells
in
an
ideal
world
the
other
is
only
conversant
with
realities
hence
poetry
must
be
more
ornamented
must
be
richer
and
fuller
and
more
delicate
because
it
is
at
liberty
to
select
whatever
images
are
naturally
most
beautiful
and
likely
to
give
most
pleasure
whereas
the
orator
is
confined
to
particular
facts
which
he
may
adorn
as
well
as
he
can
and
make
the
most
of
but
which
he
can
not
strain
beyond
a
certain
point
without
running
into
extravagance
and
affectation
and
losing
his
end
however
from
the
very
nature
of
the
case
the
orator
is
allowed
a
greater
latitude
and
is
compelled
to
make
use
of
harsher
and
more
abrupt
combinations
in
the
decoration
of
his
subject
for
his
art
is
an
attempt
to
reconcile
beauty
and
deformity
together
on
the
contrary
the
materials
of
poetry
which
are
chosen
at
pleasure
are
in
themselves
beautiful
and
naturally
combine
with
whatever
else
is
beautiful
grace
and
harmony
are
therefore
essential
to
poetry
because
they
naturally
arise
out
of
the
subject
but
whatever
adds
to
the
effect
whatever
tends
to
strengthen
the
idea
or
give
energy
to
the
mind
is
of
the
nature
of
eloquence
the
orator
is
only
concerned
to
give
a
tone
of
masculine
firmness
to
the
will
to
brace
the
sinews
and
muscles
of
the
mind
not
to
delight
our
nervous
sensibilities
or
soften
the
mind
into
voluptuous
indolence
the
flowery
and
sentimental
style
is
of
all
others
the
most
intolerable
in
a
i
shall
only
add
on
this
subject
that
modesty
impartiality
and
candour
are
not
the
virtues
of
a
public
speaker
he
must
be
confident
inflexible
uncontrollable
overcoming
all
opposition
by
his
ardour
and
impetuosity
we
do
not
others
by
sympathy
with
them
but
by
power
by
passion
by
will
calm
inquiry
sober
truth
and
speculative
indifference
will
never
carry
any
point
the
passions
are
contagious
and
we
can
not
contend
against
opposite
passions
with
nothing
but
naked
reason
concessions
to
an
enemy
are
clear
loss
he
will
take
advantage
of
them
but
make
us
none
in
return
he
will
magnify
the
weak
sides
of
our
argument
but
will
be
blind
to
whatever
makes
against
himself
the
multitude
will
always
be
inclined
to
side
with
that
party
whose
passions
are
the
most
inflamed
and
whose
prejudices
are
the
most
inveterate
passion
should
therefore
never
be
sacrificed
to
punctilio
it
should
indeed
be
governed
by
prudence
but
it
should
itself
govern
and
lend
its
impulse
and
direction
to
abstract
reason
fox
was
a
reasoner
lord
chatham
was
an
orator
burke
was
both
a
reasoner
and
a
poet
and
was
therefore
still
farther
removed
from
that
conformity
with
the
vulgar
notions
and
mechanical
feelings
of
mankind
which
will

to
that

it

an
axiom
in

among
many
other
false
ones
that
belief

we
draw
our

from
the

laid
before

and
can
not
possibly
receive
any

impression
of

than
that
which

naturally
make
upon
us
this
theory
that
the

is
purely
passive
in
the
reception
of

and
that
our

are
not

was
probably
first
invented
or
insisted
upon
as
a
screen
against
religious
persecution
and
as
an
answer
to
those
who
imputed
bad
motives
to
all
who
differed
from
the
established
faith
and
thought
they
could
reform
heresy
and
impiety
by
the
application

though
force
and
terror
may
not
be
always
the

way
to
make
converts
it
does
not
follow
that
there
may
not
be
other
means
of
influencing
our
opinions
besides
the
naked
and
abstract
evidence

which
the
storm
could
not

in
such
points
as
whether
an
object
is
black

white
or
whether
two

we
may
not
be
able
to
believe
as
we
please
or
to
deny
the
evidence
of
our
reason
and
senses

in
those
points
on
which
mankind
differ
or
where
we
can
be
at
all
in
suspense
as
to
which
side
we
shall
take
the
truth
is
not
quite
so
plain
or
palpable
it
admits
of
a
variety
of
views
and
shades
of
colouring
and
it
should
appear
that
we
can
dwell
upon
whichever
of
these
we
choose
and
heighten
or
soften
the
circumstances
adduced
in
proof
according
as
passion
and
inclination
throw
their
into
the
scale
let
any
one
for
instance
have
been
brought
up
in
an
opinion
let
him
have
remained
in
it
all
his
life
let
him
have
attached
all
his
notions
of
respectability
of
the
approbation
of
his
or
his
own
to
it
let
him
then
first
hear
it
called
in
question
and
a
strong
and
unforeseen
objection
stated
to
it
will
not
this
startle
and
shock
him
as
if
he
had
seen
a
spectre
and
will
he
not
struggle
to
resist
the
arguments
that
would
unsettle
his
habitual
convictions
as
he
would
resist
the
divorcing
of
soul
and
body
will
he
come
to
the
consideration
of
the
question
impartially
indifferently
and
without
any
wrong
bias
or
give
the
painful
and
revolting
truth
the
same
cordial
welcome
as
the
and
favourite
prejudice
to
say
that
the
truth
or
falsehood
of
a
proposition
is
the
only
circumstance
that
gains
it
admittance
into
the
mind
independently
of
the
pleasure
or
pain
it
affords
us
is
itself
an
assertion
made
in
pure
caprice
or
desperation
a
person
may
have
a
profession
or
employment
connected
with
a
certain
belief
it
may
be
the
means
of
livelihood
to
him
and
the
changing
it
may
require
considerable
sacrifices
or
may
leave
him
almost
without
resource
to
say
nothing
of
mortified
pride
this
will
not
mend
the
matter
the
evidence
against
his
former
opinion
may
be
so
strong
or
may
appear
so
to
him
that
he
may
be
obliged
to
give
it
up
but
not
without
a
pang
and
after
having
tried
every
artifice
and
strained
every
nerve
to
give
the
utmost
weight
to
the
arguments
favouring
his
own
side
and
to
make
light
of
and
throw
those
against
him
into
the
background
and
nine
times
in
ten
this
bias
of
the
will
and
tampering
with
the
proofs
will
prevail
it
is
only
with
very
vigorous
or
very
candid
minds
that
the
understanding
exercises
its
just
and
boasted
prerogative
and
induces
its
votaries
to
relinquish
a
profitable
delusion
and
embrace
the
dowerless
truth
even
then
they
have
the
sober
and
discreet
part
of
the
world
all
the
pères
de
who
look
principally
to
the
main
chance
against
them
and
they
are
regarded
as
little
better
than
lunatics
or
profligates
to
fling
up
a
good
salary
and
a
provision
for
themselves
and
families
for
the
sake
of
that
foolish
thing
a
with
the
herd
belief
on
all
abstract
and
disputed
topics
is
voluntary
that
is
is
determined
by
considerations
of
personal
ease
and
convenience
in
the
teeth
of
logical
analysis
and
demonstration
which
are
set
aside
as
mere
waste
of
words
in
short
generally
speaking
people
stick
to
an
opinion
that
they
have
long
supported
and
that
supports
them
how
else
shall
we
account
for
the
regular
order
and
progression
of
society
for
the
maintenance
of
certain
opinions
in
particular
professions
and
classes
of
men
as
we
keep
water
in
cisterns
till
in
fact
they
stagnate
and
corrupt
and
that
the
world
and
every
individual
in
it
is
not
about
with
every
wind
of
doctrine
and
whisper
of
uncertainty
there
is
some
more
solid
ballast
required
to
keep
things
in
their
established
order
than
the
restless
fluctuation
of
opinion
and
agitation
of
wit
we
find
that
people
in
protestant
countries
continue
protestants
and
in
catholic
countries
papists
this
it
may
be
answered
is
owing
to
the
ignorance
of
the
great
mass
of
them
but
is
their
faith
less
bigoted
because
it
is
not
founded
on
a
regular
investigation
of
the
proofs
and
is
merely
an
obstinate
determination
to
believe
what
they
have
been
told
and
accustomed
to
believe
or
is
it
not
the
same
with
the
doctors
of
the
church
and
its
most
learned
champions
who
read
the
same
texts
turn
over
the
same
authorities
and
discuss
the
same
knotty
points
through
their
whole
lives
only
to
arrive
at
opposite
conclusions
how
few
are
shaken
in
their
opinions
or
have
the
grace
to
confess
it
shall
we
then
suppose
them
all
impostors
and
that
they
keep
up
the
farce
of
a
system
of
which
they
do
not
believe
a
syllable
far
from
it
there
may
be
individual
instances
but
the
generality
are
not
only
sincere
but
bigots
those
who
are
unbelievers
and
hypocrites
scarcely
know
it
themselves
or
if
a
man
is
not
quite
a
knave
what
pains
will
he
not
take
to
make
a
fool
of
his
reason
that
his
opinions
may
tally
with
his
professions
is
there
then
a
papist
and
a
protestant
understanding
one
prepared
to
receive
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
and
the
other
to
reject
it
no
such
thing
but
in
either
case
the
ground
of
reason
is
by
passion
habit
example
scales
are
nothing
can
therefore
be
more
inconsequential
than
to
bring
the
authority
of
great
names
in
favour
of
opinions
long
established
and
universally
received
cicero
being
a
pagan
was
no
proof
in
support
of
the
heathen
mythology
but
simply
of
his
being
born
at
rome
before
the
christian
era
though
his
lurking
scepticism
on
the
subject
and
sneers
at
the
augurs
told
against
it
for
this
was
an
acknowledgment
drawn
from
him
in
spite
of
a
prevailing
prejudice
sir
isaac
newton
and
napier
of
merchiston
both
wrote
on
the
but
this
is
neither
a
ground
for
a
speedy
anticipation
of
the
millennium
nor
does
it
invalidate
the
doctrine
of
the
gravitation
of
the
planets
or
the
theory
of
logarithms
one
party
would
borrow
the
sanction
of
these
great
names
in
support
of
their
wildest
and
most
mystical
opinions
others
would
arraign
them
of
folly
and
weakness
for
having
attended
to
such
subjects
at
all
neither
inference
is
just
it
is
a
simple
question
of
chronology
or
of
the
time
when
these
celebrated
mathematicians
lived
and
of
the
studies
and
pursuits
which
were
then
chiefly
in
vogue
the
wisest
man
is
the
slave
of
opinion
except
on
one
or
two
points
on
which
he
strikes
out
a
light
for
himself
and
holds
a
torch
to
the
rest
of
the
world
but
we
are
disposed
to
make
it
out
that
all
opinions
are
the
result
of
reason
because
they
profess
to
be
so
and
when
they
are
that
is
when
they
agree
with
ours
that
there
can
be
no
alloy
of
human
frailty
or
perversity
in
them
the
very
strength
of
our
prejudice
making
it
pass
for
pure
reason
and
leading
us
to
attribute
any
deviation
from
it
to
bad
faith
or
some
unaccountable
singularity
or
infatuation
poor
human
nature
opinion
is
for
the
most
part
only
a
battle
in
which
we
take
part
and
defend
the
side
we
have
adopted
in
the
one
case
or
the
other
with
a
view
to
share
the
honour
of
the
spoil
few
will
stand
up
for
a
losing
cause
or
have
the
fortitude
to
adhere
to
a
proscribed
opinion
and
when
they
do
it
is
not
always
from
superior
strength
of
understanding
or
a
disinterested
love
of
truth
but
from
obstinacy
and
sullenness
of
temper
to
affirm
that
we
do
not
cultivate
an
acquaintance
with
truth
as
she
presents
herself
to
us
in
a
more
or
less
pleasing
shape
or
is
shabbily
attired
or
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
we
do
not
shut
our
eyes
to
the
light
when
it
dazzles
us
or
withdraw
our
hands
from
the
fire
when
it
scorches
us
passion
sways
us
to
the
mood
of
what
it
likes
or
loathes
are
we
not
averse
to
believe
bad
news
relating
to
ourselves
forward
enough
if
it
relates
to
others
if
something
is
said
reflecting
on
the
character
of
an
intimate
friend
or
near
relative
how
unwilling
we
are
to
lend
an
ear
to
it
how
we
catch
at
every
excuse
or
palliating
circumstance
and
hold
out
against
the
clearest
proof
while
we
instantly
believe
any
idle
report
against
an
enemy
magnify
the
commonest
trifles
into
crimes
and
torture
the
evidence
against
him
to
our
heart
content
do
not
we
change
our
opinion
of
the
same
person
and
make
him
out
to
be
or
according
to
the
terms
we
happen
to
be
on
if
we
have
a
favourite
author
do
we
not
exaggerate
his
beauties
and
pass
over
his
defects
and
the
human
mind
plays
the
interested
advocate
much
oftener
than
the
upright
and
inflexible
judge
in
the
colouring
and
relief
it
gives
to
the
facts
brought
before
it
we
believe
things
not
more
because
they
are
true
or
probable
than
because
we
desire
or
if
the
imagination
once
takes
that
turn
because
we
dread
them
has
more
devils
than
vast
hell
can
hold
the
sanguine
always
hope
the
gloomy
always
despond
from
temperament
and
not
from
forethought
do
we
not
disguise
the
plainest
facts
from
ourselves
if
they
are
disagreeable
do
we
not
flatter
ourselves
with
impossibilities
what
girl
does
not
look
in
the
glass
to
persuade
herself
she
is
handsome
what
woman
ever
believes
herself
old
or
does
not
hate
to
be
called
so
though
she
knows
the
exact
year
and
day
of
her
age
the
more
she
tries
to
keep
up
the
appearance
of
youth
to
herself
and
others
what
lover
would
ever
acknowledge
a
flaw
in
the
character
of
his
mistress
or
would
not
construe
her
turning
her
back
on
him
into
a
proof
of
attachment
the
story
of
and
is
pat
to
our
purpose
for
the
credulity
of
mankind
as
to
what
touches
our
inclinations
has
been
proverbial
in
all
ages
yet
we
are
told
that
the
mind
is
passive
in
making
up
these
wilful
accounts
and
is
guided
by
nothing
but
the
and
of
evidence
even
in
action
and
where
we
may
determine
by
proper
precaution
the
event
of
things
instead
of
being
compelled
to
shut
our
eyes
to
what
we
can
not
help
we
still
are
the
dupes
of
the
feeling
of
the
moment
and
prefer
amusing
ourselves
with
fair
appearances
to
securing
more
solid
benefits
by
a
sacrifice
of
imagination
and
stubborn
will
to
truth
the
blindness
of
passion
to
the
most
obvious
and
consequences
is
deplorable
there
seems
to
be
a
particular
fatality
in
this
respect
because
a
thing
is
in
our
power
we
have
committed
ourselves
we
appear
to
dally
to
trifle
with
to
make
light
of
it
and
to
think
it
will
still
be
in
our
power
we
have
committed
ourselves
strange
perversion
of
the
reasoning
faculties
which
is
little
short
of
madness
and
which
yet
is
one
of
the
constant
and
practical
sophisms
of
human
life
it
is
as
if
one
should
say
i
am
in
no
danger
from
a
tremendous
machine
unless
i
touch
such
a
spring
and
therefore
i
will
approach
it
i
will
play
with
the
danger
i
will
laugh
at
it
and
at
last
in
pure
sport
and
wantonness
of
heart
from
my
sense
of
previous
security
i
touch
it
and
an
while
the
thing
remains
in
contemplation
we
may
be
said
to
stand
safe
and
smiling
on
the
brink
as
soon
as
we
proceed
to
action
we
are
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
passion
and
hurried
to
our
destruction
a
person
taken
up
with
some
one
purpose
or
passion
is
intent
only
upon
that
he
drives
out
the
thought
of
everything
but
its
gratification
in
the
pursuit
of
that
he
is
blind
to
consequences
his
first
object
being
attained
they
all
at
once
and
as
if
by
magic
rush
upon
his
mind
the
engine
recoils
he
is
caught
in
his
own
snare
a
servant
girl
for
some
pique
or
for
an
angry
word
determines
to
poison
her
mistress
she
knows
beforehand
just
as
well
as
she
does
afterwards
that
it
is
at
least
a
hundred
chances
to
one
she
will
be
hanged
if
she
succeeds
yet
this
has
no
more
effect
upon
her
than
if
she
had
never
heard
of
any
such
matter
the
only
idea
that
occupies
her
mind
and
hardens
it
against
every
other
is
that
of
the
affront
she
has
received
and
the
desire
of
revenge
she
broods
over
it
she
meditates
the
mode
she
is
haunted
with
her
scheme
night
and
day
it
works
like
poison
it
grows
into
a
madness
and
she
can
have
no
peace
till
it
is
accomplished
and
her
but
the
moment
this
is
the
case
and
her
passion
is
assuaged
fear
takes
place
of
hatred
the
slightest
suspicion
alarms
her
with
the
certainty
of
her
fate
from
which
she
before
wilfully
averted
her
thoughts
she
runs
wildly
from
the
officers
before
they
know
anything
of
the
matter
the
gallows
stares
her
in
the
face
and
if
none
else
accuses
her
so
full
is
she
of
her
danger
and
her
guilt
that
she
probably
betrays
herself
she
at
first
would
see
no
consequences
to
result
from
her
crime
but
the
getting
rid
of
a
present
uneasiness
she
now
sees
the
very
worst
the
whole
seems
to
depend
on
the
turn
given
to
the
imagination
on
our
immediate
disposition
to
attend
to
this
or
that
view
of
the
subject
the
evil
or
the
good
as
long
as
our
intention
is
unknown
to
the
world
before
it
breaks
out
into
action
it
seems
to
be
deposited
in
our
own
bosoms
to
be
a
mere
feverish
dream
and
to
be
left
with
all
its
consequences
under
our
imaginary
control
but
no
sooner
is
it
realised
and
known
to
others
than
it
appears
to
have
escaped
from
our
reach
we
fancy
the
whole
world
are
up
in
arms
against
us
and
vengeance
is
ready
to
pursue
and
overtake
us
so
in
the
pursuit
of
pleasure
we
see
only
that
side
of
the
question
which
we
approve
the
disagreeable
consequences
which
may
take
place
make
no
part
of
our
intention
or
concern
or
of
the
wayward
exercise
of
our
will
if
they
should
happen
we
can
not
help
it
they
form
an
ugly
and
contrast
to
our
favourite
speculation
we
turn
our
thoughts
another
way
repeating
the
adage
sic
mihi
ostendis
incredulus
it
is
a
good
remark
in
that
a
bankrupt
walks
in
the
streets
the
day
before
his
name
is
in
the
gazette
with
the
same
erect
and
confident
brow
as
ever
and
only
feels
the
mortification
of
his
situation
after
it
becomes
known
to
others
such
is
the
force
of
sympathy
and
its
power
to
take
off
the
edge
of
internal
conviction
as
long
we
can
impose
upon
the
world
we
can
impose
upon
ourselves
and
trust
to
the
flattering
appearances
though
we
know
them
to
be
false
we
put
off
the
evil
day
as
long
as
we
can
make
a
jest
of
it
as
the
certainty
becomes
more
painful
and
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
secret
to
ourselves
till
it
can
no
longer
be
kept
from
all
the
world
in
short
we
believe
just
as
little
or
as
much
as
we
please
of
those
things
in
which
our
will
can
be
supposed
to
interfere
and
it
is
only
by
setting
aside
our
own
interests
and
inclinations
on
more
general
questions
that
we
stand
any
chance
of
arriving
at
a
fair
and
rational
judgment
those
who
have
the
largest
hearts
have
the
soundest
understandings
and
he
is
the
truest
philosopher
who
can
forget
himself
this
is
the
reason
why
philosophers
are
often
said
to
be
mad
for
thinking
only
of
the
abstract
truth
and
of
none
of
its
worldly
adjuncts
it
seems
like
an
absence
of
mind
or
as
if
the
devil
had
got
into
them
if
belief
were
not
in
some
degree
voluntary
or
were
grounded
entirely
on
strict
evidence
and
absolute
proof
every
one
would
be
a
martyr
to
his
opinions
and
we
should
have
no
power
of
evading
or
glossing
over
those
conclusions
for
which
positive
vouchers
could
be
produced
however
painful
these
conclusions
might
be
to
our
own
feelings

offensive
to
the
prejudices
of

on

the

its

these
i
adhere

for
they
are
true

me
and
dear
in
themselves
are
dearer
for
the
sake
of
what
is
departed
leading
me
back
by
the
hand
to
that
dreaming
world
in
the
innocence
of
which
they
sat
and
made
sweet
music
waking
the
promise
of
future
years
and
answered
by
the
eager
throbbings
of
my
own
breast
but
now
credulous
hope
of
mutual
minds
is
and
i
turn
back
from
the
world
that
has
deceived
me
to
nature
that
lent
it
a
false
beauty
and
that
keeps
up
the
illusion
of
the
past
as
i
quaff
my
libations
of
tea
in
a
morning
i
love
to
watch
the
clouds
sailing
from
the
west
and
fancy
that
spring
comes
slowly
up
this
way
in
this
hope
while
are
dank
and
ways
are
mire
i
follow
the
same
direction
to
a
neighbouring
wood
where
having
gained
the
dry
level
greensward
i
can
see
my
way
for
a
mile
before
me
closed
in
on
each
side
by
and
ending
in
a
point
of
light
more
or
less
brilliant
as
the
day
is
bright
or
cloudy
what
a
walk
is
this
to
me
i
have
no
need
of
book
or
companion
the
days
the
hours
the
thoughts
of
my
youth
are
at
my
side
and
blend
with
the
air
that
fans
my
cheek
here
i
can
saunter
for
hours
bending
my
eye
forward
stopping
and
turning
to
look
back
thinking
to
strike
off
into
some
less
trodden
path
yet
hesitating
to
quit
the
one
i
am
in
afraid
to
snap
the
brittle
threads
of
memory
i
remark
the
shining
trunks
and
slender
branches
of
the
birch
trees
waving
in
the
idle
breeze
or
a
pheasant
springs
up
on
whirring
wing
or
i
recall
the
spot
where
i
once
found
a
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
weltering
in
its
gore
and
think
how
many
seasons
have
flown
since
left
its
little
life
in
air
dates
names
faces
come
back
to
what
purpose
or
why
think
of
them
now
or
rather
why
not
think
of
them
oftener
we
walk
through
life
as
through
a
narrow
path
with
a
thin
curtain
drawn
around
it
behind
are
ranged
rich
portraits
airy
harps
are
strung
yet
we
will
not
stretch
forth
our
hands
and
lift
aside
the
veil
to
catch
glimpses
of
the
one
or
sweep
the
chords
of
the
other
as
in
a
theatre
when
the
green
curtain
drew
up
groups
of
figures
fantastic
dresses
laughing
faces
rich
banquets
stately
columns
gleaming
vistas
appeared
beyond
so
we
have
only
at
any
time
to
through
the
blanket
of
the
past
to
possess
ourselves
at
once
of
all
that
has
regaled
our
senses
that
is
stored
up
in
our
memory
that
has
struck
our
fancy
that
has
pierced
our
hearts
yet
to
all
this
we
are
indifferent
insensible
and
seem
intent
only
on
the
present
vexation
the
future
disappointment
if
there
is
a
titian
hanging
up
in
the
room
with
me
i
scarcely
regard
it
how
then
should
i
be
expected
to
strain
the
mental
eye
so
far
or
to
throw
down
by
the
magic
spells
of
the
will
the
stone
walls
that
enclose
it
in
the
louvre
there
is
one
head
there
of
which
i
have
often
thought
when
looking
at
it
that
nothing
should
ever
disturb
me
again
and
i
would
become
the
character
it
represents
such
perfect
calmness
and
reigns
in
it
why
do
i
not
hang
all
image
of
this
in
some
dusky
corner
of
my
brain
and
turn
all
eye
upon
it
ever
and
anon
as
i
have
need
of
some
such
talisman
to
calm
my
troubled
thoughts
the
attempt
is
fruitless
if
not
natural
or
like
that
of
the
french
to
hang
garlands
on
the
grave
and
to
conjure
back
the
dead
by
miniature
pictures
of
them
while
living
it
is
only
some
actual
coincidence
or
local
association
that
tends
without
violence
to
all
the
cells
where
memory
slept
i
can
easily
by
stooping
over
the
grass
and
clay
cold
clod
recall
the
tufts
of
primroses
or
purple
hyacinths
that
formerly
grew
on
the
same
spot
and
cover
the
bushes
with
leaves
and
as
they
were
eighteen
summers
ago
or
prolonging
my
walk
and
hearing
the
sighing
gale
rustle
through
a
tall
straight
wood
at
the
end
of
it
call
fancy
that
i
distinguish
the
cry
of
hounds
and
the
fatal
group
issuing
from
it
as
in
the
tale
of
theodore
and
honoria
a
moaning
gust
of
wind
aids
the
belief
i
look
once
more
to
see
whether
the
trees
before
me
answer
to
the
idea
of
the
grove
and
an
city
towers
over
their
grey
tops
all
the
cities
in
romanian
lands
the
chief
and
most
renown
ravenna
stands
i
return
home
resolved
to
read
the
entire
poem
through
and
after
dinner
drawing
my
chair
to
the
fire
and
holding
a
small
print
close
to
my
eyes
launch
into
the
full
tide
of
dryden
couplets
a
stream
of
sound
comparing
his
didactic
and
descriptive
pomp
with
the
simple
pathos
and
picturesque
truth
of
boccaccio
story
and
tasting
with
a
pleasure
which
none
but
all
habitual
reader
can
feel
some
quaint
examples
of
pronunciation
in
this
accomplished
versifier
when
honoria
view
the
fresh
her
former
fright
renew
made
th
which
in
his
grief
appears
the
means
to
mourn
thee
with
my
pious
tears
these
trifling
instances
of
the
wavering
and
unsettled
state
of
the
language
give
double
effect
to
the
firm
and
stately
march
of
the
verse
and
make
me
dwell
with
a
sort
of
tender
interest
on
the
difficulties
and
doubts
of
all
earlier
period
of
literature
they
pronounced
words
then
in
a
manner
which
we
should
laugh
at
now
and
they
wrote
verse
in
a
manner
which
we
can
do
anything
but
laugh
at
the
pride
of
a
new
acquisition
seems
to
give
fresh
confidence
to
it
to
impel
the
rolling
syllables
through
the
moulds
provided
for
them
and
to
overflow
the
envious
bounds
of
rhyme
into
triplets
what
sometimes
surprises
me
in
looking
back
to
the
past
is
with
the
exception
already
stated
to
find
myself
so
little
changed
in
the
time
the
same
images
and
trains
of
thought
stick
by
me
i
have
the
same
tastes
likings
sentiments
and
wishes
that
i
had
then
one
great
ground
of
confidence
and
support
has
indeed
been
struck
from
under
my
feet
but
i
have
made
it
up
to
myself
by
proportionable
pertinacity
of
opinion
the
success
of
the
great
cause
to
which
i
had
vowed
myself
was
to
me
more
than
all
the
world
i
had
a
strength
in
its
strength
a
resource
which
i
knew
not
of
till
it
failed
me
for
the
second
time
was
glenartny
stately
tree
oh
to
see
lord
ronald
more
it
was
not
till
i
saw
the
axe
laid
to
the
root
that
i
found
the
full
extent
of
what
i
had
to
lose
and
suffer
but
my
conviction
of
the
right
was
only
established
by
the
triumph
of
the
wrong
and
my
earliest
hopes
will
be
my
last
regrets
one
source
of
this
unbendingness
which
some
may
call
obstinacy
is
that
though
living
much
alone
i
have
never
worshipped
the
echo
i
see
plainly
enough
that
black
is
not
white
that
the
grass
is
green
that
kings
are
not
their
subjects
and
in
such
cases
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
collate
my
opinions
with
the
received
prejudices
in
subtler
questions
and
matters
that
admit
of
doubt
as
i
do
not
impose
my
opinion
on
others
without
a
reason
so
i
will
not
give
up
mine
to
them
without
a
better
reason
and
a
person
calling
me
names
or
giving
himself
airs
of
authority
does
not
convince
me
of
his
having
taken
more
pains
to
find
out
the
truth
than
i
have
but
the
contrary
gifford
once
said
that
i
was
sitting
over
my
gin
and
i
fancied
myself
a
leibnitz
he
did
not
so
much
as
know
that
i
had
ever
read
a
metaphysical
book
was
i
therefore
out
of
complaisance
or
deference
to
him
to
forget
whether
i
had
or
not
leigh
hunt
is
puzzled
to
reconcile
the
shyness
of
my
pretensions
with
the
inveteracy
and
sturdiness
of
my
principles
i
should
have
thought
they
were
nearly
the
same
thing
both
from
disposition
and
habit
i
can
nothing
in
word
look
or
manner
i
can
not
steal
a
march
upon
public
opinion
in
any
way
my
standing
upright
speaking
loud
entering
a
room
gracefully
proves
nothing
therefore
i
neglect
these
ordinary
means
of
recommending
myself
to
the
good
graces
and
admiration
of
strangers
and
as
it
appears
even
of
philosophers
and
friends
why
because
i
have
other
resources
or
at
least
am
absorbed
in
other
studies
and
pursuits
suppose
this
absorption
to
be
extreme
and
even
morbid
that
i
have
brooded
over
an
idea
till
it
has
become
a
kind
of
substance
in
my
brain
that
i
have
reasons
for
a
thing
which
i
have
found
out
with
much
labour
and
pains
and
to
which
i
can
scarcely
do
justice
without
the
utmost
violence
of
exertion
and
that
only
to
a
few
persons
is
this
a
reason
for
my
playing
off
my
notions
in
all
companies
wearing
a
prim
and
air
as
if
i
were
admired
of
all
observers
or
is
it
not
rather
an
argument
together
with
a
want
of
animal
spirits
why
i
should
retire
into
myself
and
perhaps
acquire
a
nervous
and
uneasy
look
from
a
consciousness
of
the
disproportion
between
the
interest
and
conviction
i
feel
on
certain
subjects
and
my
ability
to
communicate
what
weighs
upon
my
own
mind
to
others
if
my
ideas
which
i
do
not
avouch
but
suppose
lie
below
the
surface
why
am
i
to
be
always
attempting
to
dazzle
superficial
people
with
them
or
smiling
delighted
at
my
own
want
of
success
in
matters
of
taste
and
feeling
one
proof
that
my
conclusions
have
not
been
quite
shallow
or
hasty
is
the
circumstance
of
their
having
been
lasting
i
have
the
same
favourite
books
pictures
passages
that
i
ever
had
i
may
therefore
presume
that
they
will
last
me
my
life
nay
i
may
indulge
a
hope
that
my
thoughts
will
survive
me
this
continuity
of
impression
is
the
only
thing
on
which
i
pride
myself
even
lamb
whose
relish
of
certain
things
is
as
keen
and
earnest
as
possible
takes
a
surfeit
of
admiration
and
i
should
be
afraid
to
ask
about
his
select
authors
or
particular
friends
after
a
lapse
of
ten
years
as
to
myself
any
one
knows
where
to
have
me
what
i
have
once
made
up
my
mind
to
i
abide
by
to
the
end
of
the
chapter
one
cause
of
my
independence
of
opinion
is
i
believe
the
liberty
i
give
to
others
or
the
very
diffidence
and
distrust
of
making
converts
i
should
be
an
excellent
man
on
a
jury
i
might
say
little
but
should
starve
other
eleven
obstinate
fellows
out
i
remember
godwin
writing
to
wordsworth
that
tragedy
of
could
not
fail
of
success
it
was
damned
past
all
redemption
i
said
to
wordsworth
that
i
thought
this
a
natural
consequence
for
how
could
any
one
have
a
dramatic
turn
of
mind
who
judged
entirely
of
others
from
himself
godwin
might
be
convinced
of
the
excellence
of
his
work
but
how
could
he
know
that
others
would
be
convinced
of
it
unless
by
supposing
that
they
were
as
wise
as
himself
and
as
infallible
critics
of
dramatic
poetry
so
many
aristotles
sitting
in
judgment
on
euripides
this
shows
why
pride
is
connected
with
shyness
and
reserve
for
the
really
proud
have
not
so
high
an
opinion
of
the
generality
as
to
suppose
that
they
can
understand
them
or
that
there
is
any
common
measure
between
them
so
dryden
exclaims
of
his
opponents
with
bitter
disdain
can
i
think
what
thoughts
they
can
conceive
i
have
not
sought
to
make
partisans
still
less
did
i
dream
of
making
enemies
and
have
therefore
kept
my
opinions
myself
whether
they
were
currently
adopted
or
not
to
get
others
to
come
into
our
ways
of
thinking
we
must
go
over
to
theirs
and
it
is
necessary
to
follow
in
order
to
lead
at
the
time
i
lived
here
formerly
i
had
no
suspicion
that
i
should
ever
become
a
voluminous
writer
yet
i
had
just
the
same
confidence
in
my
feelings
before
i
had
ventured
to
air
them
in
public
as
i
have
now
neither
the
outcry
or
moves
me
a
jot
i
do
not
say
that
the
one
is
not
more
agreeable
than
the
other
not
far
from
the
spot
where
i
write
i
first
read
chaucer
and
and
was
charmed
with
that
young
beauty
shrouded
in
her
bower
and
listening
with
delight
to
the
repeated
song
of
the
nightingale
close
by
her
the
impression
of
the
scene
the
vernal
landscape
the
cool
of
the
morning
the
gushing
notes
of
the
songstress
ayen
methought
she
sung
close
by
mine
ear
is
as
vivid
as
if
it
had
been
of
yesterday
and
nothing
can
persuade
me
that
that
is
not
a
fine
poem
i
do
not
find
this
impression
conveyed
in
dryden
version
and
therefore
nothing
can
persuade
me
that
that
is
as
fine
i
used
to
walk
out
at
this
time
with
and
miss
lamb
of
an
evening
to
look
at
the
claude
lorraine
skies
over
our
heads
melting
from
azure
into
purple
and
gold
and
to
gather
mushrooms
that
sprung
up
at
our
feet
to
throw
into
our
hashed
mutton
at
supper
i
was
at
that
time
an
enthusiastic
admirer
of
claude
and
could
dwell
for
ever
on
one
or
two
of
the
finest
prints
from
him
hung
round
my
little
room
the
fleecy
flocks
the
bending
trees
the
winding
streams
the
groves
the
nodding
temples
the
hills
and
distant
sunny
vales
and
tried
to
translate
them
into
their
lovely
living
hues
people
then
told
me
that
wilson
was
much
superior
to
claude
i
did
not
believe
them
their
pictures
have
since
been
seen
together
at
the
british
institution
and
all
the
world
have
come
into
my
opinion
i
have
not
on
that
account
given
it
up
i
will
not
compare
our
hashed
mutton
with
amelia
but
it
put
us
in
mind
of
it
and
led
to
a
discussion
sharply
seasoned
and
well
sustained
till
midnight
the
result
of
which
appeared
some
years
after
in
the
have
i
a
better
opinion
of
those
criticisms
on
that
account
or
should
i
therefore
maintain
them
with
greater
vehemence
and
tenaciousness
oh
no
both
rather
with
less
now
that
they
are
before
the
public
and
it
is
for
them
to
make
their
election
it
is
in
looking
back
to
such
scenes
that
i
draw
my
best
consolation
for
the
future
later
impressions
come
and
go
and
serve
to
fill
till
the
intervals
but
these
are
my
standing
resource
my
true
classics
if
i
have
had
few
real
pleasures
or
advantages
my
ideas
from
their
sinewy
texture
have
been
to
me
in
the
nature
of
realities
and
if
i
should
not
be
able
to
add
to
the
stock
i
can
live
by
husbanding
the
interest
as
to
my
speculations
there
is
little
to
admire
in
them
but
my
admiration
of
others
and
whether
they
have
an
echo
in
time
to
come
or
not
i
have
learned
to
set
a
grateful
value
on
the
past
and
am
content
to
wind
up
the
account
of
what
is
personal
only
to
myself
and
the
immediate
circle
of
objects
in
which
i
have
moved
with
an
act
of
easy
oblivion
such
scene

every
future
view
