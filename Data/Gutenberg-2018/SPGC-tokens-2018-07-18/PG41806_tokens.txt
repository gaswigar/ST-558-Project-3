preface
oscar
wilde
visited
america
in
the
year
interest
in
the
æsthetic
school
of
which
he
was
already
the
acknowledged
master
had
sometime
previously
spread
to
the
united
states
and
it
is
said
that
the
production
of
the
gilbert
and
sullivan
opera
patience
in
which
he
and
his
disciples
were
held
up
to
ridicule
determined
him
to
pay
a
visit
to
the
states
to
give
some
lectures
explaining
what
he
meant
by
æstheticism
hoping
thereby
to
interest
and
possibly
to
instruct
and
elevate
our
transatlantic
cousins
he
set
sail
on
board
the
arizona
on
saturday
december
arriving
in
new
york
early
in
the
following
year
on
landing
he
was
bombarded
by
journalists
eager
to
interview
the
distinguished
stranger
punch
in
its
issue
of
january
in
a
happy
vein
parodied
these
interviewers
the
most
amusing
passage
in
which
referred
to
his
glorious
past
wherein
wilde
was
made
to
say
precisely
i
took
the
newdigate
oh
no
doubt
every
year
some
man
gets
the
newdigate
but
not
every
year
does
newdigate
get
an
at
omaha
where
under
the
auspices
of
the
social
art
club
wilde
delivered
a
lecture
on
decorative
art
he
described
his
impressions
of
many
american
houses
as
being
illy
designed
decorated
shabbily
and
in
bad
taste
filled
with
furniture
that
was
not
honestly
made
and
was
out
of
this
statement
gave
rise
to
the
following
verses
what
a
shame
and
what
a
pity
in
the
streets
of
london
city
wilde
is
seen
no
more
far
from
piccadilly
banished
he
to
omaha
has
vanished
horrid
place
which
swells
ignore
on
his
back
a
coat
he
beareth
such
as
sir
john
bennet
weareth
made
of
velvet
strange
array
legs
apollo
might
have
sighed
for
or
great
hercules
have
died
for
his
knee
breeches
now
display
waving
sunflower
and
lily
he
calls
all
the
houses
illy
decorated
and
for
of
taste
they
ve
not
a
tittle
they
may
chew
and
they
may
whittle
but
they
re
all
born
his
lectures
dealt
almost
exclusively
with
the
subjects
of
art
and
dress
reform
in
the
course
of
one
lecture
he
remarked
that
the
most
impressive
room
he
had
yet
entered
in
america
was
the
one
in
camden
town
where
he
met
walt
whitman
it
contained
plenty
of
fresh
air
and
sunlight
on
the
table
was
a
simple
cruse
of
water
this
led
to
a
parody
in
the
style
of
whitman
describing
an
imaginary
interview
between
the
two
poets
which
appeared
in
the
century
a
few
months
later
wilde
is
called
narcissus
and
whitman
paumanokides
paumanokides
who
may
this
be
this
young
man
clad
unusually
with
loose
locks
languorous
glidingly
toward
me
advancing
toward
the
ceiling
of
my
chamber
his
orbic
and
expressive
eyeballs
uprolling
and
so
on
to
which
narcissus
replies
o
clarion
from
whose
brazen
throat
strange
sounds
across
the
seas
are
blown
where
england
girt
as
with
a
moat
a
strong
sits
alone
of
the
lectures
which
he
delivered
in
america
only
one
has
been
preserved
namely
that
on
the
english
renaissance
this
was
his
first
lecture
and
it
was
delivered
in
new
york
on
january
according
to
a
contemporary
account
in
the
new
york
herald
a
distinguished
and
crowded
audience
assembled
in
chickering
hall
that
evening
to
listen
to
one
who
was
well
worth
seeing
his
short
breeches
and
silk
stockings
showing
to
even
better
advantage
upon
the
stage
than
in
the
gilded
where
the
young
apostle
has
heretofore
been
seen
in
new
on
leaving
the
states
in
the
fall
of
the
year
wilde
proceeded
to
canada
and
thence
to
nova
scotia
arriving
in
halifax
in
the
second
week
of
october
of
his
visit
there
we
have
no
record
except
an
amusing
interview
described
in
a
local
paper
a
few
days
later
he
was
dressed
in
a
velvet
jacket
with
an
ordinary
linen
collar
and
neck
tie
and
he
wore
trousers
mr
wilde
the
interviewer
states
was
communicative
and
genial
he
said
he
found
canada
pleasant
but
in
answer
to
a
question
as
to
whether
european
or
american
women
were
the
more
beautiful
he
dexterously
evaded
his
as
regards
poetry
he
expressed
his
opinion
that
poe
was
the
greatest
american
poet
and
that
walt
whitman
if
not
a
poet
was
a
man
who
sounded
a
strong
note
perhaps
neither
prose
nor
poetry
but
something
of
his
own
that
was
grand
original
and
during
his
tour
in
america
wilde
happened
to
find
himself
as
he
has
himself
described
it
in
louisville
kentucky
the
subject
he
had
selected
to
speak
on
was
the
mission
of
art
in
the
nineteenth
century
in
the
course
of
his
lecture
he
had
occasion
to
quote
keats
sonnet
on
blue
as
an
example
of
the
poet
s
delicate
sense
of
after
the
lecture
there
came
round
to
see
him
a
lady
of
middle
age
with
a
sweet
gentle
manner
and
most
musical
voice
who
introduced
herself
as
mrs
speed
the
daughter
of
george
keats
and
she
invited
the
lecturer
to
come
and
examine
the
keats
manuscripts
in
her
possession
some
months
afterwards
when
lecturing
in
california
he
received
a
letter
from
this
lady
asking
him
to
accept
the
original
manuscript
of
the
sonnet
which
he
had
quoted
mention
must
be
made
of
wilde
s
first
play
a
drama
in
blank
verse
entitled
vera
or
the
it
had
been
arranged
that
before
his
departure
for
america
this
play
should
be
performed
at
the
adelphi
theatre
london
with
bernard
beere
as
the
heroine
on
saturday
december
but
a
few
weeks
before
the
date
fixed
for
the
first
performance
the
author
decided
to
postpone
the
production
owing
to
the
state
of
political
feeling
in
on
his
return
to
england
in
wilde
started
on
a
lecturing
tour
the
first
being
to
the
art
students
of
the
royal
academy
at
their
club
in
golden
square
on
june
ten
days
later
he
spoke
at
prince
s
hall
on
his
personal
impressions
of
america
and
on
subsequent
occasions
at
margate
ramsgate
and
southampton
on
monday
july
he
lectured
at
southport
and
on
the
following
thursday
he
went
to
liverpool
to
welcome
langtry
on
her
return
from
america
and
the
same
afternoon
he
left
on
his
second
visit
to
the
states
in
order
to
superintend
the
rehearsals
of
vera
which
it
had
been
arranged
to
produce
at
the
union
square
theatre
new
york
on
august
following
the
piece
was
not
a
success
it
was
indeed
the
only
failure
wilde
had
however
his
next
play
which
he
called
his
opus
secundum
also
a
blank
verse
tragedy
had
a
successful
run
in
america
in
this
was
the
duchess
of
padua
played
by
lawrence
barrett
under
the
title
of
guido
this
has
not
been
seen
in
england
nor
is
it
even
possible
for
wilde
s
admirers
to
read
this
early
offspring
of
his
pen
for
only
twenty
copies
were
printed
for
acting
purposes
in
america
and
of
these
but
one
is
known
to
be
in
existence
in
this
country
at
least
an
authorised
german
translation
was
made
by
max
meyerfeld
and
the
first
performance
took
place
at
the
german
theatre
in
hamburg
about
a
year
ago
an
english
version
is
advertised
from
a
piratical
publisher
in
paris
but
it
is
only
a
translation
from
the
german
back
into
english
towards
the
end
of
september
oscar
wilde
returned
to
england
and
immediately
began
an
all
round
lecturing
tour
his
first
visit
being
to
wandsworth
town
hall
on
monday
september
when
he
delivered
to
an
enthusiastic
audience
a
lecture
on
his
impressions
of
america
which
is
contained
in
the
following
pages
he
was
dressed
a
london
paper
of
the
time
states
in
ordinary
evening
costume
and
carried
an
silk
handkerchief
in
his
breast
he
spoke
with
great
fluency
in
a
voice
now
and
then
singularly
musical
and
only
once
or
twice
made
a
scarcely
perceptible
reference
to
the
lecture
was
under
the
auspices
of
a
local
literary
society
and
the
principle
residents
of
the
district
turned
out
en
the
chairman
the
rev
john
park
in
introducing
the
lecturer
said
there
were
two
reasons
why
he
was
glad
to
welcome
him
and
he
thought
his
own
feelings
would
be
shared
by
the
audience
they
must
all
plead
guilty
to
a
feeling
of
curiosity
he
hoped
a
laudable
one
to
see
and
hear
wilde
for
his
own
sake
and
they
were
also
glad
to
hear
about
america
a
country
which
many
might
regard
as
a
kind
of
elysium
on
march
in
the
following
year
wilde
lectured
at
the
crystal
palace
on
his
american
experiences
and
on
april
he
preached
his
gospel
in
the
when
it
is
recorded
that
his
audience
was
not
only
delighted
with
his
humour
but
was
surprised
at
the
excellent
good
sense
he
his
subject
was
a
plea
in
favour
of
art
for
schools
and
many
of
his
remarks
about
the
english
system
of
elementary
education
with
its
insistence
on
the
population
of
places
that
no
one
ever
wants
to
go
to
and
its
familiarity
with
the
lives
of
persons
who
probably
never
existed
were
said
to
be
quite
worthy
of
ruskin
a
contemporary
account
adds
that
wilde
showed
himself
a
pupil
of
ruskin
s
too
in
insisting
on
the
importance
of
every
child
being
taught
some
handicraft
and
in
looking
forward
to
the
time
when
a
boy
would
rather
look
at
a
bird
or
even
draw
it
than
throw
his
customary
stone
the
british
gamin
has
not
made
much
progress
in
this
respect
during
the
last
twenty
years
his
lectures
on
dress
with
the
newspaper
correspondence
which
they
evoked
including
some
of
oscar
wilde
s
replies
in
his
most
characteristic
vein
must
be
reserved
for
a
future
volume
stuart
mason
oxford
january
footnotes
first
produced
at
the
opera
comique
april
wilde
was
burlesqued
as
reginald
bunthorne
a
fleshly
poet
wilde
repeated
this
lecture
throughout
the
states
during
his
tour
at
rochester
on
february
he
met
with
a
most
disorderly
reception
on
the
part
of
the
college
students
two
days
later
joaquin
miller
of
louis
wrote
to
wilde
saying
that
he
had
read
with
shame
about
the
behaviour
of
those
to
this
wilde
replied
i
thank
you
for
your
chivalrous
and
courteous
letter
and
in
the
course
of
his
letter
makes
a
more
special
attack
on
that
critic
whom
he
terms
the
itinerant
libeller
of
new
impressions
of
america
i
fear
i
can
not
picture
america
as
altogether
an
elysium
perhaps
from
the
ordinary
standpoint
i
know
but
little
about
the
country
i
can
not
give
its
latitude
or
longitude
i
can
not
compute
the
value
of
its
dry
goods
and
i
have
no
very
close
acquaintance
with
its
politics
these
are
matters
which
may
not
interest
you
and
they
certainly
are
not
interesting
to
me
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
on
landing
in
america
was
that
if
the
americans
are
not
the
most
people
in
the
world
they
are
the
most
comfortably
dressed
men
are
seen
there
with
the
dreadful
hat
but
there
are
very
few
hatless
men
men
wear
the
shocking
coat
but
few
are
to
be
seen
with
no
coat
at
all
there
is
an
air
of
comfort
in
the
appearance
of
the
people
which
is
a
marked
contrast
to
that
seen
in
this
country
where
too
often
people
are
seen
in
close
contact
with
rags
the
next
thing
particularly
noticeable
is
that
everybody
seems
in
a
hurry
to
catch
a
train
this
is
a
state
of
things
which
is
not
favourable
to
poetry
or
romance
had
romeo
or
juliet
been
in
a
constant
state
of
anxiety
about
trains
or
had
their
minds
been
agitated
by
the
question
of
shakespeare
could
not
have
given
us
those
lovely
balcony
scenes
which
are
so
full
of
poetry
and
pathos
america
is
the
noisiest
country
that
ever
existed
one
is
waked
up
in
the
morning
not
by
the
singing
of
the
nightingale
but
by
the
steam
whistle
it
is
surprising
that
the
sound
practical
sense
of
the
americans
does
not
reduce
this
intolerable
noise
all
art
depends
upon
exquisite
and
delicate
sensibility
and
such
continual
turmoil
must
ultimately
be
destructive
of
the
musical
faculty
there
is
not
so
much
beauty
to
be
found
in
american
cities
as
in
oxford
cambridge
salisbury
or
winchester
where
are
lovely
relics
of
a
beautiful
age
but
still
there
is
a
good
deal
of
beauty
to
be
seen
in
them
now
and
then
but
only
where
the
american
has
not
attempted
to
create
it
where
the
americans
have
attempted
to
produce
beauty
they
have
signally
failed
a
remarkable
characteristic
of
the
americans
is
the
manner
in
which
they
have
applied
science
to
modern
life
this
is
apparent
in
the
most
cursory
stroll
through
new
york
in
england
an
inventor
is
regarded
almost
as
a
crazy
man
and
in
too
many
instances
invention
ends
in
disappointment
and
poverty
in
america
an
inventor
is
honoured
help
is
forthcoming
and
the
exercise
of
ingenuity
the
application
of
science
to
the
work
of
man
is
there
the
shortest
road
to
wealth
there
is
no
country
in
the
world
where
machinery
is
so
lovely
as
in
america
i
have
always
wished
to
believe
that
the
line
of
strength
and
the
line
of
beauty
are
one
that
wish
was
realised
when
i
contemplated
american
machinery
it
was
not
until
i
had
seen
the
at
chicago
that
i
realised
the
wonders
of
machinery
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
steel
rods
the
symmetrical
motion
of
the
great
wheels
is
the
most
beautifully
rhythmic
thing
i
have
ever
seen
one
is
impressed
in
america
but
not
favourably
impressed
by
the
inordinate
size
of
everything
the
country
seems
to
try
to
bully
one
into
a
belief
in
its
power
by
its
impressive
bigness
i
was
disappointed
with
niagara
most
people
must
be
disappointed
with
niagara
every
american
bride
is
taken
there
and
the
sight
of
the
stupendous
waterfall
must
be
one
of
the
earliest
if
not
the
keenest
disappointments
in
american
married
life
one
sees
it
under
bad
conditions
very
far
away
the
point
of
view
not
showing
the
splendour
of
the
water
to
appreciate
it
really
one
has
to
see
it
from
underneath
the
fall
and
to
do
that
it
is
necessary
to
be
dressed
in
a
yellow
which
is
as
ugly
as
a
mackintosh
and
i
hope
none
of
you
ever
wears
one
it
is
a
consolation
to
know
however
that
such
an
artist
as
madame
bernhardt
has
not
only
worn
that
yellow
ugly
dress
but
has
been
photographed
in
it
perhaps
the
most
beautiful
part
of
america
is
the
west
to
reach
which
however
involves
a
journey
by
rail
of
six
days
racing
along
tied
to
an
ugly
of
a
steam
engine
i
found
but
poor
consolation
for
this
journey
in
the
fact
that
the
boys
who
infest
the
cars
and
sell
everything
that
one
can
eat
or
should
not
eat
were
selling
editions
of
my
poems
vilely
printed
on
a
kind
of
grey
blotting
paper
for
the
low
price
of
ten
cents
calling
these
boys
on
one
side
i
told
them
that
though
poets
like
to
be
popular
they
desire
to
be
paid
and
selling
editions
of
my
poems
without
giving
me
a
profit
is
dealing
a
blow
at
literature
which
must
have
a
disastrous
effect
on
poetical
aspirants
the
invariable
reply
that
they
made
was
that
they
themselves
made
a
profit
out
of
the
transaction
and
that
was
all
they
cared
about
it
is
a
popular
superstition
that
in
america
a
visitor
is
invariably
addressed
as
i
was
never
once
addressed
as
when
i
went
to
texas
i
was
called
captain
when
i
got
to
the
centre
of
the
country
i
was
addressed
as
colonel
and
on
arriving
at
the
borders
of
mexico
as
on
the
whole
however
sir
the
old
english
method
of
addressing
people
is
the
most
common
it
is
perhaps
worth
while
to
note
that
what
many
people
call
americanisms
are
really
old
english
expressions
which
have
lingered
in
our
colonies
while
they
have
been
lost
in
our
own
country
many
people
imagine
that
the
term
i
guess
which
is
so
common
in
america
is
purely
an
american
expression
but
it
was
used
by
john
locke
in
his
work
on
the
understanding
just
as
we
now
use
i
it
is
in
the
colonies
and
not
in
the
mother
country
that
the
old
life
of
the
country
really
exists
if
one
wants
to
realise
what
english
puritanism
is
not
at
its
worst
when
it
is
very
bad
but
at
its
best
and
then
it
is
not
very
good
i
do
not
think
one
can
find
much
of
it
in
england
but
much
can
be
found
about
boston
and
massachusetts
we
have
got
rid
of
it
america
still
preserves
it
to
be
i
hope
a
curiosity
san
francisco
is
a
really
beautiful
city
china
town
peopled
by
chinese
labourers
is
the
most
artistic
town
i
have
ever
come
across
the
people
strange
melancholy
orientals
whom
many
people
would
call
common
and
they
are
certainly
very
poor
have
determined
that
they
will
have
nothing
about
them
that
is
not
beautiful
in
the
chinese
restaurant
where
these
navvies
meet
to
have
supper
in
the
evening
i
found
them
drinking
tea
out
of
china
cups
as
delicate
as
the
petals
of
a
whereas
at
the
gaudy
hotels
i
was
supplied
with
a
delf
cup
an
inch
and
a
half
thick
when
the
chinese
bill
was
presented
it
was
made
out
on
rice
paper
the
account
being
done
in
indian
ink
as
fantastically
as
if
an
artist
had
been
etching
little
birds
on
a
fan
salt
lake
city
contains
only
two
buildings
of
note
the
chief
being
the
tabernacle
which
is
in
the
shape
of
a
it
is
decorated
by
the
only
native
artist
and
he
has
treated
religious
subjects
in
the
naive
spirit
of
the
early
florentine
painters
representing
people
of
our
own
day
in
the
dress
of
the
period
side
by
side
with
people
of
biblical
history
who
are
clothed
in
some
romantic
costume
the
building
next
in
importance
is
called
the
amelia
palace
in
honour
of
one
of
brigham
young
s
wives
when
he
died
the
present
president
of
the
mormons
stood
up
in
the
tabernacle
and
said
that
it
had
been
revealed
to
him
that
he
was
to
have
the
amelia
palace
and
that
on
this
subject
there
were
to
be
no
more
revelations
of
any
kind
from
salt
lake
city
one
travels
over
the
great
plains
of
colorado
and
up
the
rocky
mountains
on
the
top
of
which
is
leadville
the
richest
city
in
the
world
it
has
also
got
the
reputation
of
being
the
roughest
and
every
man
carries
a
revolver
i
was
told
that
if
i
went
there
they
would
be
sure
to
shoot
me
or
my
travelling
manager
i
wrote
and
told
them
that
nothing
that
they
could
do
to
my
travelling
manager
would
intimidate
me
they
are
miners
men
working
in
metals
so
i
lectured
to
them
on
the
ethics
of
art
i
read
them
passages
from
the
autobiography
of
benvenuto
cellini
and
they
seemed
much
delighted
i
was
reproved
by
my
hearers
for
not
having
brought
him
with
me
i
explained
that
he
had
been
dead
for
some
little
time
which
elicited
the
enquiry
who
shot
him
they
afterwards
took
me
to
a
dancing
saloon
where
i
saw
the
only
rational
method
of
art
criticism
i
have
ever
come
across
over
the
piano
was
printed
a
notice
please
do
not
shoot
the
pianist
he
is
doing
his
best
the
mortality
among
pianists
in
that
place
is
marvellous
then
they
asked
me
to
supper
and
having
accepted
i
had
to
descend
a
mine
in
a
rickety
bucket
in
which
it
was
impossible
to
be
graceful
having
got
into
the
heart
of
the
mountain
i
had
supper
the
first
course
being
whisky
the
second
whisky
and
the
third
whisky
i
went
to
the
theatre
to
lecture
and
i
was
informed
that
just
before
i
went
there
two
men
had
been
seized
for
committing
a
murder
and
in
that
theatre
they
had
been
brought
on
to
the
stage
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
then
and
there
tried
and
executed
before
a
crowded
audience
but
i
found
these
miners
very
charming
and
not
at
all
rough
among
the
more
elderly
inhabitants
of
the
south
i
found
a
melancholy
tendency
to
date
every
event
of
importance
by
the
late
war
how
beautiful
the
moon
is
i
once
remarked
to
a
gentleman
who
was
standing
next
to
me
yes
was
his
reply
but
you
should
have
seen
it
before
the
so
infinitesimal
did
i
find
the
knowledge
of
art
west
of
the
rocky
mountains
that
an
art
patron
one
who
in
his
day
had
been
a
miner
actually
sued
the
railroad
company
for
damages
because
the
plaster
cast
of
venus
of
milo
which
he
had
imported
from
paris
had
been
delivered
minus
the
arms
and
what
is
more
surprising
still
he
gained
his
case
and
the
damages
pennsylvania
with
its
rocky
gorges
and
woodland
scenery
reminded
me
of
switzerland
the
prairie
reminded
me
of
a
piece
of
the
spanish
and
french
have
left
behind
them
memorials
in
the
beauty
of
their
names
all
the
cities
that
have
beautiful
names
derive
them
from
the
spanish
or
the
french
the
english
people
give
intensely
ugly
names
to
places
one
place
had
such
an
ugly
name
that
i
refused
to
lecture
there
it
was
called
grigsville
supposing
i
had
founded
a
school
of
art
there
fancy
early
imagine
a
school
of
art
teaching
grigsville
as
for
slang
i
did
not
hear
much
of
it
though
a
young
lady
who
had
changed
her
clothes
after
an
afternoon
dance
did
say
that
after
the
heel
kick
she
shifted
her
day
american
youths
are
pale
and
precocious
or
sallow
and
supercilious
but
american
girls
are
pretty
and
charming
little
oases
of
pretty
unreasonableness
in
a
vast
desert
of
practical
every
american
girl
is
entitled
to
have
twelve
young
men
devoted
to
her
they
remain
her
slaves
and
she
rules
them
with
charming
nonchalance
the
men
are
entirely
given
to
business
they
have
as
they
say
their
brains
in
front
of
their
heads
they
are
also
exceedingly
acceptive
of
new
ideas
their
education
is
practical
we
base
the
education
of
children
entirely
on
books
but
we
must
give
a
child
a
mind
before
we
can
instruct
the
mind
children
have
a
natural
antipathy
to
books
handicraft
should
be
the
basis
of
education
boys
and
girls
should
be
taught
to
use
their
hands
to
make
something
and
they
would
be
less
apt
to
destroy
and
be
mischievous
in
going
to
america
one
learns
that
poverty
is
not
a
necessary
accompaniment
to
civilisation
there
at
any
rate
is
a
country
that
has
no
trappings
no
pageants
and
no
gorgeous
ceremonies
i
saw
only
two
processions
one
was
the
fire
brigade
preceded
by
the
police
the
other
was
the
police
preceded
by
the
fire
brigade
every
man
when
he
gets
to
the
age
of
is
allowed
a
vote
and
thereby
immediately
acquires
his
political
education
the
americans
are
the
best
politically
educated
people
in
the
world
it
is
well
worth
one
s
while
to
go
to
a
country
which
can
teach
us
the
beauty
of
the
word
freedom
and
the
value
of
the
thing

oscar
wilde
in
america
an
interesting
account
of
oscar
wilde
at
the
time
of
his
american
tour
was
given
in
the
s
a
few
weeks
after
his
arrival
in
new
york
the
city
which
he
described
as
one
huge
whiteley
s
sidenote
his
abode
he
was
interviewed
in
a
room
which
was
intensely
warm
and
the
sofa
on
which
the
poet
reclined
was
drawn
up
to
the
fire
an
immense
wolf
rug
bordered
with
scarlet
was
thrown
over
it
and
his
graceful
form
in
its
warm
embrace
wilde
was
wearied
in
a
languid
half
enervated
manner
he
gently
sipped
hot
chocolate
from
a
cup
by
his
side
occasionally
he
inhaled
a
long
deep
whiff
from
a
smouldering
cigarette
held
lightly
in
his
white
and
shapely
hand
sidenote
his
dress
he
was
attired
in
a
smoking
suit
of
dark
brown
velvet
faced
with
lapels
of
red
quilted
silk
the
ends
of
a
long
dark
necktie
floated
over
the
facing
like
on
foam
tinged
by
the
dying
sun
dark
brown
nether
garments
striped
with
red
up
the
seam
and
patent
leather
shoes
with
light
cloth
uppers
completed
the
rest
of
the
poet
s
costume
his
favourite
colour
is
said
to
have
been
something
between
brown
and
green
a
tint
that
never
was
on
sea
or
sky
and
he
had
a
complete
suit
made
of
it
a
white
which
he
was
in
the
habit
of
carrying
was
presented
to
him
at
the
acropolis
and
was
said
to
have
been
cut
from
the
olive
groves
of
the
academia
only
in
the
evening
was
he
wont
to
don
knee
breeches
but
evening
and
morning
alike
adds
his
interviewer
find
him
neither
more
nor
less
than
a
man
and
always
a
perfect
sidenote
his
appearance
long
masses
of
dark
brown
hair
parted
in
the
middle
fell
in
odd
curves
of
beauty
over
his
broad
shoulders
he
wore
neither
beard
nor
moustache
the
full
rather
sensuous
lips
now
pressed
close
together
with
momentary
tension
now
parted
in
kindly
smile
showed
to
perfection
the
nobility
of
his
countenance
a
grecian
nose
and
a
flush
of
health
on
the
poet
s
face
added
all
that
was
required
to
make
it
a
truly
remarkable
one
the
eyes
were
large
dark
and
in
expression
he
was
a
charming
companion
who
could
tell
racy
stories
and
repeat
of
those
whom
society
delighted
to
honour
and
at
the
same
time
could
cap
quotations
from
greek
authors
