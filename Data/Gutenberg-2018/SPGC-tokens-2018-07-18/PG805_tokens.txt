amory
son
of
beatrice
amory
blaine
inherited
from
his
mother
every
trait
except
the
stray
inexpressible
few
that
made
him
worth
while
his
father
an
ineffectual
inarticulate
man
with
a
taste
for
byron
and
a
habit
of
drowsing
over
the
encyclopedia
britannica
grew
wealthy
at
thirty
through
the
death
of
two
elder
brothers
successful
chicago
brokers
and
in
the
first
flush
of
feeling
that
the
world
was
his
went
to
bar
harbor
and
met
beatrice
in
consequence
stephen
blaine
handed
down
to
posterity
his
height
of
just
under
six
feet
and
his
tendency
to
waver
at
crucial
moments
these
two
abstractions
appearing
in
his
son
amory
for
many
years
he
hovered
in
the
background
of
his
family
life
an
unassertive
figure
with
a
face
by
lifeless
silky
hair
continually
occupied
in
taking
care
of
his
wife
continually
harassed
by
the
idea
that
he
did
and
could
understand
her
but
beatrice
blaine
there
was
a
woman
early
pictures
taken
on
her
father
estate
at
lake
geneva
wisconsin
or
in
rome
at
the
sacred
heart
convent
an
educational
extravagance
that
in
her
youth
was
only
for
the
daughters
of
the
exceptionally
wealthy
showed
the
exquisite
delicacy
of
her
features
the
consummate
art
and
simplicity
of
her
clothes
a
brilliant
education
she
had
her
youth
passed
in
renaissance
glory
she
was
versed
in
the
latest
gossip
of
the
older
roman
families
known
by
name
as
a
fabulously
wealthy
american
girl
to
cardinal
vitori
and
queen
margherita
and
more
subtle
celebrities
that
one
must
have
had
some
culture
even
to
have
heard
of
she
learned
in
england
to
prefer
whiskey
and
soda
to
wine
and
her
small
talk
was
broadened
in
two
senses
during
a
winter
in
vienna
all
in
all
beatrice
absorbed
the
sort
of
education
that
will
be
quite
impossible
ever
again
a
tutelage
measured
by
the
number
of
things
and
people
one
could
be
contemptuous
of
and
charming
about
a
culture
rich
in
all
arts
and
traditions
barren
of
all
ideas
in
the
last
of
those
days
when
the
great
gardener
clipped
the
inferior
roses
to
produce
one
perfect
bud
in
her
less
important
moments
she
returned
to
america
met
stephen
blaine
and
married
him
this
almost
entirely
because
she
was
a
little
bit
weary
a
little
bit
sad
her
only
child
was
carried
through
a
tiresome
season
and
brought
into
the
world
on
a
spring
day
in
when
amory
was
five
he
was
already
a
delightful
companion
for
her
he
was
an
boy
with
great
handsome
eyes
which
he
would
grow
up
to
in
time
a
facile
imaginative
mind
and
a
taste
for
fancy
dress
from
his
fourth
to
his
tenth
year
he
did
the
country
with
his
mother
in
her
father
private
car
from
coronado
where
his
mother
became
so
bored
that
she
had
a
nervous
breakdown
in
a
fashionable
hotel
down
to
mexico
city
where
she
took
a
mild
almost
epidemic
consumption
this
trouble
pleased
her
and
later
she
made
use
of
it
as
an
intrinsic
part
of
her
atmosphere
especially
after
several
astounding
bracers
so
while
more
or
less
fortunate
little
rich
boys
were
defying
governesses
on
the
beach
at
newport
or
being
spanked
or
tutored
or
read
to
from
do
and
dare
or
frank
on
the
mississippi
amory
was
biting
acquiescent
in
the
waldorf
outgrowing
a
natural
repugnance
to
chamber
music
and
symphonies
and
deriving
a
highly
specialized
education
from
his
mother
yes
such
a
quaint
name
for
his
mother
she
encouraged
it
dear
do
of
getting
out
of
bed
yet
i
always
suspected
that
early
rising
in
early
life
makes
one
nervous
clothilde
is
having
your
breakfast
brought
all
i
am
feeling
very
old
amory
she
would
sigh
her
face
a
rare
cameo
of
pathos
her
voice
exquisitely
modulated
her
hands
as
facile
as
bernhardt
my
nerves
are
on
edge
on
edge
we
must
leave
this
terrifying
place
and
go
searching
for
amory
penetrating
green
eyes
would
look
out
through
tangled
hair
at
his
mother
even
at
this
age
he
had
no
illusions
about
her
oh
i
want
you
to
take
a
bath
as
hot
as
you
can
bear
it
and
just
relax
your
nerves
you
can
read
in
the
tub
if
you
she
fed
him
sections
of
the
fetes
galantes
before
he
was
ten
at
eleven
he
could
talk
glibly
if
rather
reminiscently
of
brahms
and
mozart
and
beethoven
one
afternoon
when
left
alone
in
the
hotel
at
hot
springs
he
sampled
his
mother
apricot
cordial
and
as
the
taste
pleased
him
he
became
quite
tipsy
this
was
fun
for
a
while
but
he
essayed
a
cigarette
in
his
exaltation
and
succumbed
to
a
vulgar
plebeian
reaction
though
this
incident
horrified
beatrice
it
also
secretly
amused
her
and
became
part
of
what
in
a
later
generation
would
have
been
termed
her
this
son
of
mine
he
heard
her
tell
a
room
full
of
awestruck
admiring
women
one
day
is
entirely
sophisticated
and
quite
charming
but
delicate
we
all
delicate
you
her
hand
was
radiantly
outlined
against
her
beautiful
bosom
then
sinking
her
voice
to
a
whisper
she
told
them
of
the
apricot
cordial
they
rejoiced
for
she
was
a
brave
raconteuse
but
many
were
the
keys
turned
in
sideboard
locks
that
night
against
the
possible
defection
of
little
bobby
or
barbara
these
domestic
pilgrimages
were
invariably
in
state
two
maids
the
private
car
or
blaine
when
available
and
very
often
a
physician
when
amory
had
the
four
disgusted
specialists
glared
at
each
other
hunched
around
his
bed
when
he
took
scarlet
fever
the
number
of
attendants
including
physicians
and
nurses
totalled
fourteen
however
blood
being
thicker
than
broth
he
was
pulled
through
the
blaines
were
attached
to
no
city
they
were
the
blaines
of
lake
geneva
they
had
quite
enough
relatives
to
serve
in
place
of
friends
and
an
enviable
standing
from
pasadena
to
cape
cod
but
beatrice
grew
more
and
more
prone
to
like
only
new
acquaintances
as
there
were
certain
stories
such
as
the
history
of
her
constitution
and
its
many
amendments
memories
of
her
years
abroad
that
it
was
necessary
for
her
to
repeat
at
regular
intervals
like
freudian
dreams
they
must
be
thrown
off
else
they
would
sweep
in
and
lay
siege
to
her
nerves
but
beatrice
was
critical
about
american
women
especially
the
floating
population
of
they
have
accents
my
dear
she
told
amory
not
southern
accents
or
boston
accents
not
an
accent
attached
to
any
locality
just
an
accent
she
became
dreamy
they
pick
up
old
london
accents
that
are
down
on
their
luck
and
have
to
be
used
by
some
one
they
talk
as
an
english
butler
might
after
several
years
in
a
chicago
she
became
almost
incoherent
suppose
time
in
every
western
woman
life
she
feels
her
husband
is
prosperous
enough
for
her
to
have
accent
they
try
to
impress
my
dear
though
she
thought
of
her
body
as
a
mass
of
frailties
she
considered
her
soul
quite
as
ill
and
therefore
important
in
her
life
she
had
once
been
a
catholic
but
discovering
that
priests
were
infinitely
more
attentive
when
she
was
in
process
of
losing
or
regaining
faith
in
mother
church
she
maintained
an
enchantingly
wavering
attitude
often
she
deplored
the
bourgeois
quality
of
the
american
catholic
clergy
and
was
quite
sure
that
had
she
lived
in
the
shadow
of
the
great
continental
cathedrals
her
soul
would
still
be
a
thin
flame
on
the
mighty
altar
of
rome
still
next
to
doctors
priests
were
her
favorite
sport
ah
bishop
wiston
she
would
declare
i
do
not
want
to
talk
of
myself
i
can
imagine
the
stream
of
hysterical
women
fluttering
at
your
doors
beseeching
you
to
be
simpatico
then
after
an
interlude
filled
by
the
clergyman
but
my
mood
is
oddly
only
to
bishops
and
above
did
she
divulge
her
clerical
romance
when
she
had
first
returned
to
her
country
there
had
been
a
pagan
swinburnian
young
man
in
asheville
for
whose
passionate
kisses
and
unsentimental
conversations
she
had
taken
a
decided
penchant
they
had
discussed
the
matter
pro
and
con
with
an
intellectual
romancing
quite
devoid
of
sappiness
eventually
she
had
decided
to
marry
for
background
and
the
young
pagan
from
asheville
had
gone
through
a
spiritual
crisis
joined
the
catholic
church
and
was
now
monsignor
darcy
indeed
blaine
he
is
still
delightful
company
quite
the
cardinal
amory
will
go
to
him
one
day
i
know
breathed
the
beautiful
lady
and
monsignor
darcy
will
understand
him
as
he
understood
amory
became
thirteen
rather
tall
and
slender
and
more
than
ever
on
to
his
celtic
mother
he
had
tutored
occasionally
the
idea
being
that
he
was
to
keep
up
at
each
place
taking
up
the
work
where
he
left
off
yet
as
no
tutor
ever
found
the
place
he
left
off
his
mind
was
still
in
very
good
shape
what
a
few
more
years
of
this
life
would
have
made
of
him
is
problematical
however
four
hours
out
from
land
italy
bound
with
beatrice
his
appendix
burst
probably
from
too
many
meals
in
bed
and
after
a
series
of
frantic
telegrams
to
europe
and
america
to
the
amazement
of
the
passengers
the
great
ship
slowly
wheeled
around
and
returned
to
new
york
to
deposit
amory
at
the
pier
you
will
admit
that
if
it
was
not
life
it
was
magnificent
after
the
operation
beatrice
had
a
nervous
breakdown
that
bore
a
suspicious
resemblance
to
delirium
tremens
and
amory
was
left
in
minneapolis
destined
to
spend
the
ensuing
two
years
with
his
aunt
and
uncle
there
the
crude
vulgar
air
of
western
civilization
first
catches
him
in
his
underwear
so
to
speak
a
kiss
for
amory
his
lip
curled
when
he
read
it
i
am
going
to
have
a
bobbing
party
it
said
on
thursday
december
the
seventeenth
at
five
and
i
would
like
it
very
much
if
you
could
come
yours
truly
myra
claire
he
had
been
two
months
in
minneapolis
and
his
chief
struggle
had
been
the
concealing
from
the
other
guys
at
school
how
particularly
superior
he
felt
himself
to
be
yet
this
conviction
was
built
upon
shifting
sands
he
had
shown
off
one
day
in
french
class
he
was
in
senior
french
class
to
the
utter
confusion
of
reardon
whose
accent
amory
damned
contemptuously
and
to
the
delight
of
the
class
reardon
who
had
spent
several
weeks
in
paris
ten
years
before
took
his
revenge
on
the
verbs
whenever
he
had
his
book
open
but
another
time
amory
showed
off
in
history
class
with
quite
disastrous
results
for
the
boys
there
were
his
own
age
and
they
shrilled
innuendoes
at
each
other
all
the
following
week
aw
i
doncherknow
the
umuricun
revolution
was
an
affair
of
the
middul
or
washington
came
of
very
good
blood
aw
quite
good
i
amory
ingeniously
tried
to
retrieve
himself
by
blundering
on
purpose
two
years
before
he
had
commenced
a
history
of
the
united
states
which
though
it
only
got
as
far
as
the
colonial
wars
had
been
pronounced
by
his
mother
completely
enchanting
his
chief
disadvantage
lay
in
athletics
but
as
soon
as
he
discovered
that
it
was
the
touchstone
of
power
and
popularity
at
school
he
began
to
make
furious
persistent
efforts
to
excel
in
the
winter
sports
and
with
his
ankles
aching
and
bending
in
spite
of
his
efforts
he
skated
valiantly
around
the
lorelie
rink
every
afternoon
wondering
how
soon
he
would
be
able
to
carry
a
without
getting
it
inexplicably
tangled
in
his
skates
the
invitation
to
miss
myra
claire
bobbing
party
spent
the
morning
in
his
coat
pocket
where
it
had
an
intense
physical
affair
with
a
dusty
piece
of
peanut
brittle
during
the
afternoon
he
brought
it
to
light
with
a
sigh
and
after
some
consideration
and
a
preliminary
draft
in
the
back
of
collar
and
daniel
latin
composed
an
answer
my
dear
miss
claire
your
truly
charming
envitation
for
the
evening
of
next
thursday
evening
was
truly
delightful
to
receive
this
morning
i
will
be
charm
and
inchanted
indeed
to
present
my
compliments
on
next
thursday
evening
faithfully
amory
blaine
on
thursday
therefore
he
walked
pensively
along
the
slippery
sidewalks
and
came
in
sight
of
myra
house
on
the
after
five
a
lateness
which
he
fancied
his
mother
would
have
favored
he
waited
on
the
with
his
eyes
nonchalantly
and
planned
his
entrance
with
precision
he
would
cross
the
floor
not
too
hastily
to
claire
and
say
with
exactly
the
correct
modulation
my
claire
i
sorry
to
be
late
but
my
maid
he
paused
there
and
realized
he
would
be
quoting
but
my
uncle
and
i
had
to
see
a
fella
yes
i
met
your
enchanting
daughter
at
then
he
would
shake
hands
using
that
slight
bow
with
all
the
starchy
little
females
and
nod
to
the
fellas
who
would
be
standing
paralyzed
into
rigid
groups
for
mutual
protection
a
butler
one
of
the
three
in
minneapolis
swung
open
the
door
amory
stepped
inside
and
divested
himself
of
cap
and
coat
he
was
mildly
surprised
not
to
hear
the
shrill
squawk
of
conversation
from
the
next
room
and
he
decided
it
must
be
quite
formal
he
approved
of
that
as
he
approved
of
the
butler
miss
myra
he
said
to
his
surprise
the
butler
grinned
horribly
oh
yeah
he
declared
she
he
was
unaware
that
his
failure
to
be
cockney
was
ruining
his
standing
amory
considered
him
coldly
but
continued
the
butler
his
voice
rising
unnecessarily
she
the
only
one
what
here
the
party
amory
gasped
in
sudden
horror
what
she
been
waitin
for
amory
blaine
that
you
ai
it
her
mother
says
that
if
you
showed
up
by
you
two
was
to
go
after
in
the
amory
despair
was
crystallized
by
the
appearance
of
myra
herself
bundled
to
the
ears
in
a
polo
coat
her
face
plainly
sulky
her
voice
pleasant
only
with
difficulty
he
had
described
the
state
of
his
vitality
well
you
here
well
i
tell
you
i
guess
you
do
know
about
the
auto
accident
he
romanced
myra
eyes
opened
wide
who
was
it
to
well
he
continued
desperately
uncle
aunt
was
any
one
amory
paused
and
then
nodded
your
uncle
alarm
oh
no
just
a
horse
a
sorta
gray
at
this
point
the
erse
butler
snickered
probably
killed
the
engine
he
suggested
amory
would
have
put
him
on
the
rack
without
a
scruple
we
go
now
said
myra
coolly
you
see
amory
the
bobs
were
ordered
for
five
and
everybody
was
here
so
we
could
wait
well
i
could
help
it
could
i
so
mama
said
for
me
to
wait
till
five
we
catch
the
bobs
before
it
gets
to
the
minnehaha
club
amory
shredded
poise
dropped
from
him
he
pictured
the
happy
party
jingling
along
snowy
streets
the
appearance
of
the
limousine
the
horrible
public
descent
of
him
and
myra
before
sixty
reproachful
eyes
his
apology
a
real
one
this
time
he
sighed
aloud
what
inquired
myra
nothing
i
was
just
yawning
are
we
going
to
catch
up
with
before
they
get
there
he
was
encouraging
a
faint
hope
that
they
might
slip
into
the
minnehaha
club
and
meet
the
others
there
be
found
in
blasé
seclusion
before
the
fire
and
quite
regain
his
lost
attitude
oh
sure
mike
we
catch
all
right
let
he
became
conscious
of
his
stomach
as
they
stepped
into
the
machine
he
hurriedly
slapped
the
paint
of
diplomacy
over
a
rather
plan
he
had
conceived
it
was
based
upon
some
gleaned
at
to
the
effect
that
he
was
awful
and
sort
myra
he
said
lowering
his
voice
and
choosing
his
words
carefully
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
can
you
ever
forgive
me
she
regarded
him
gravely
his
intent
green
eyes
his
mouth
that
to
her
taste
was
the
quintessence
of
romance
yes
myra
could
forgive
him
very
easily
why
yes
he
looked
at
her
again
and
then
dropped
his
eyes
he
had
lashes
i
awful
he
said
sadly
i
i
do
know
why
i
make
faux
pas
i
do
care
i
then
recklessly
i
been
smoking
too
much
i
got
myra
pictured
an
tobacco
debauch
with
amory
pale
and
reeling
from
the
effect
of
nicotined
lungs
she
gave
a
little
gasp
oh
do
smoke
you
stunt
your
i
do
care
he
persisted
gloomily
i
got
ta
i
got
the
habit
done
a
lot
of
things
that
if
my
fambly
knew
he
hesitated
giving
her
imagination
time
to
picture
dark
horrors
i
went
to
the
burlesque
show
last
myra
was
quite
overcome
he
turned
the
green
eyes
on
her
again
the
only
girl
in
town
i
like
much
he
exclaimed
in
a
rush
of
sentiment
you
myra
was
not
sure
that
she
was
but
it
sounded
stylish
though
vaguely
improper
thick
dusk
had
descended
outside
and
as
the
limousine
made
a
sudden
turn
she
was
jolted
against
him
their
hands
touched
you
should
smoke
amory
she
whispered
do
you
know
that
he
shook
his
head
nobody
myra
hesitated
something
stirred
within
amory
oh
yes
you
do
you
got
a
crush
on
froggy
parker
i
guess
everybody
knows
no
i
have
very
slowly
a
silence
while
amory
thrilled
there
was
something
fascinating
about
myra
shut
away
here
cosily
from
the
dim
chill
air
myra
a
little
bundle
of
clothes
with
strands
of
yellow
hair
curling
out
from
under
her
skating
cap
because
i
got
a
crush
too
he
paused
for
he
heard
in
the
distance
the
sound
of
young
laughter
and
peering
through
the
frosted
glass
along
the
street
he
made
out
the
dark
outline
of
the
bobbing
party
he
must
act
quickly
he
reached
over
with
a
violent
jerky
effort
and
clutched
myra
hand
her
thumb
to
be
exact
tell
him
to
go
to
the
minnehaha
straight
he
whispered
i
wanta
talk
to
you
i
to
talk
to
myra
made
out
the
party
ahead
had
an
instant
vision
of
her
mother
and
then
alas
for
convention
glanced
into
the
eyes
beside
turn
down
this
side
street
richard
and
drive
straight
to
the
minnehaha
club
she
cried
through
the
speaking
tube
amory
sank
back
against
the
cushions
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
can
kiss
her
he
thought
i
bet
i
can
i
i
can
overhead
the
sky
was
half
crystalline
half
misty
and
the
night
around
was
chill
and
vibrant
with
rich
tension
from
the
country
club
steps
the
roads
stretched
away
dark
creases
on
the
white
blanket
huge
heaps
of
snow
lining
the
sides
like
the
tracks
of
giant
moles
they
lingered
for
a
moment
on
the
steps
and
watched
the
white
holiday
moon
pale
moons
like
that
one
amory
made
a
vague
gesture
make
people
mysterieuse
you
look
like
a
young
witch
with
her
cap
off
and
her
hair
sorta
mussed
her
hands
clutched
at
her
hair
oh
leave
it
it
looks
they
drifted
up
the
stairs
and
myra
led
the
way
into
the
little
den
of
his
dreams
where
a
cosy
fire
was
burning
before
a
big
couch
a
few
years
later
this
was
to
be
a
great
stage
for
amory
a
cradle
for
many
an
emotional
crisis
now
they
talked
for
a
moment
about
bobbing
parties
there
always
a
bunch
of
shy
fellas
he
commented
sitting
at
the
tail
of
the
bob
sorta
lurkin
an
whisperin
an
pushin
each
other
off
then
there
always
some
crazy
girl
he
gave
a
terrifying
imitation
she
always
talkin
sorta
to
the
you
such
a
funny
boy
puzzled
myra
how
mean
amory
gave
immediate
attention
on
his
own
ground
at
last
oh
always
talking
about
crazy
things
why
do
you
come
with
marylyn
and
i
i
do
like
girls
in
the
daytime
he
said
shortly
and
then
thinking
this
a
bit
abrupt
he
added
but
i
like
he
cleared
his
throat
i
like
you
first
and
second
and
myra
eyes
became
dreamy
what
a
story
this
would
make
to
tell
marylyn
here
on
the
couch
with
this
boy
the
little
fire
the
sense
that
they
were
alone
in
the
great
building
myra
capitulated
the
atmosphere
was
too
appropriate
i
like
you
the
first
she
confessed
her
voice
trembling
and
froggy
parker
froggy
had
fallen
places
in
one
hour
as
yet
he
had
not
even
noticed
it
but
amory
being
on
the
spot
leaned
over
quickly
and
kissed
cheek
he
had
never
kissed
a
girl
before
and
he
tasted
his
lips
curiously
as
if
he
had
munched
some
new
fruit
then
their
lips
brushed
like
young
wild
flowers
in
the
wind
we
awful
rejoiced
myra
gently
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
her
head
drooped
against
his
shoulder
sudden
revulsion
seized
amory
disgust
loathing
for
the
whole
incident
he
desired
frantically
to
be
away
never
to
see
myra
again
never
to
kiss
any
one
he
became
conscious
of
his
face
and
hers
of
their
clinging
hands
and
he
wanted
to
creep
out
of
his
body
and
hide
somewhere
safe
out
of
sight
up
in
the
corner
of
his
mind
kiss
me
her
voice
came
out
of
a
great
void
i
do
want
to
he
heard
himself
saying
there
was
another
pause
i
do
want
to
he
repeated
passionately
myra
sprang
up
her
cheeks
pink
with
bruised
vanity
the
great
bow
on
the
back
of
her
head
trembling
sympathetically
i
hate
you
she
cried
do
you
ever
dare
to
speak
to
me
again
what
stammered
amory
i
tell
mama
you
kissed
me
i
will
too
i
will
too
i
tell
mama
and
she
wo
let
me
play
with
you
amory
rose
and
stared
at
her
helplessly
as
though
she
were
a
new
animal
of
whose
presence
on
the
earth
he
had
not
heretofore
been
aware
the
door
opened
suddenly
and
myra
mother
appeared
on
the
threshold
fumbling
with
her
lorgnette
well
she
began
adjusting
it
benignantly
the
man
at
the
desk
told
me
you
two
children
were
up
here
how
do
you
do
amory
watched
myra
and
waited
for
the
crash
but
none
came
the
pout
faded
the
high
pink
subsided
and
myra
voice
was
placid
as
a
summer
lake
when
she
answered
her
mother
oh
we
started
so
late
mama
that
i
thought
we
might
as
well
he
heard
from
below
the
shrieks
of
laughter
and
smelled
the
vapid
odor
of
hot
chocolate
and
as
he
silently
followed
mother
and
daughter
the
sound
of
the
graphophone
mingled
with
the
voices
of
many
girls
humming
the
air
and
a
faint
glow
was
born
and
spread
over
him
mounted
to
the
his
orders
in
his
hand
mounted
to
the
took
his
farewell
journey
to
the
snapshots
of
the
young
egotist
amory
spent
nearly
two
years
in
minneapolis
the
first
winter
he
wore
moccasins
that
were
born
yellow
but
after
many
applications
of
oil
and
dirt
assumed
their
mature
color
a
dirty
greenish
brown
he
wore
a
gray
plaid
mackinaw
coat
and
a
red
toboggan
cap
his
dog
count
del
monte
ate
the
red
cap
so
his
uncle
gave
him
a
gray
one
that
pulled
down
over
his
face
the
trouble
with
this
one
was
that
you
breathed
into
it
and
your
breath
froze
one
day
the
darn
thing
froze
his
cheek
he
rubbed
snow
on
his
cheek
but
it
turned
just
the
same
the
count
del
monte
ate
a
box
of
bluing
once
but
it
did
hurt
him
later
however
he
lost
his
mind
and
ran
madly
up
the
street
bumping
into
fences
rolling
in
gutters
and
pursuing
his
eccentric
course
out
of
amory
life
amory
cried
on
his
bed
poor
little
count
he
cried
oh
little
after
several
months
he
suspected
count
of
a
fine
piece
of
emotional
acting
amory
and
frog
parker
considered
that
the
greatest
line
in
literature
occurred
in
act
iii
of
arsene
they
sat
in
the
first
row
at
the
wednesday
and
saturday
matinees
the
line
was
if
one
ca
be
a
great
artist
or
a
great
soldier
the
next
best
thing
is
to
be
a
great
amory
fell
in
love
again
and
wrote
a
poem
this
was
it
marylyn
and
sallee
those
are
the
girls
for
me
marylyn
stands
above
sallee
in
that
sweet
deep
he
was
interested
in
whether
mcgovern
of
minnesota
would
make
the
first
or
second
how
to
do
the
how
to
do
the
chameleon
ties
how
babies
were
born
and
whether
brown
was
really
a
better
pitcher
than
christie
mathewson
among
other
things
he
read
for
the
honor
of
the
school
little
women
twice
the
common
law
sapho
dangerous
dan
mcgrew
the
broad
highway
three
times
the
fall
of
the
house
of
usher
three
weeks
mary
ware
the
little
colonel
chum
gunga
din
the
police
gazette
and
jems
he
had
all
the
henty
biasses
in
history
and
was
particularly
fond
of
the
cheerful
murder
stories
of
mary
roberts
rinehart
school
ruined
his
french
and
gave
him
a
distaste
for
standard
authors
his
masters
considered
him
idle
unreliable
and
superficially
clever
he
collected
locks
of
hair
from
many
girls
he
wore
the
rings
of
several
finally
he
could
borrow
no
more
rings
owing
to
his
nervous
habit
of
chewing
them
out
of
shape
this
it
seemed
usually
aroused
the
jealous
suspicions
of
the
next
borrower
all
through
the
summer
months
amory
and
frog
parker
went
each
week
to
the
stock
company
afterward
they
would
stroll
home
in
the
balmy
air
of
august
night
dreaming
along
hennepin
and
nicollet
avenues
through
the
gay
crowd
amory
wondered
how
people
could
fail
to
notice
that
he
was
a
boy
marked
for
glory
and
when
faces
of
the
throng
turned
toward
him
and
ambiguous
eyes
stared
into
his
he
assumed
the
most
romantic
of
expressions
and
walked
on
the
air
cushions
that
lie
on
the
asphalts
of
fourteen
always
after
he
was
in
bed
there
were
voices
indefinite
fading
enchanting
just
outside
his
window
and
before
he
fell
asleep
he
would
dream
one
of
his
favorite
waking
dreams
the
one
about
becoming
a
great
or
the
one
about
the
japanese
invasion
when
he
was
rewarded
by
being
made
the
youngest
general
in
the
world
it
was
always
the
becoming
he
dreamed
of
never
the
being
this
too
was
quite
characteristic
of
amory
code
of
the
young
egotist
before
he
was
summoned
back
to
lake
geneva
he
had
appeared
shy
but
inwardly
glowing
in
his
first
long
trousers
set
off
by
a
purple
accordion
tie
and
a
belmont
collar
with
the
edges
unassailably
meeting
purple
socks
and
handkerchief
with
a
purple
border
peeping
from
his
breast
pocket
but
more
than
that
he
had
formulated
his
first
philosophy
a
code
to
live
by
which
as
near
as
it
can
be
named
was
a
sort
of
aristocratic
egotism
he
had
realized
that
his
best
interests
were
bound
up
with
those
of
a
certain
variant
changing
person
whose
label
in
order
that
his
past
might
always
be
identified
with
him
was
amory
blaine
amory
marked
himself
a
fortunate
youth
capable
of
infinite
expansion
for
good
or
evil
he
did
not
consider
himself
a
strong
but
relied
on
his
facility
learn
things
sorta
quick
and
his
superior
mentality
read
a
lotta
deep
books
he
was
proud
of
the
fact
that
he
could
never
become
a
mechanical
or
scientific
genius
from
no
other
heights
was
he
debarred
amory
thought
that
he
was
exceedingly
handsome
he
was
he
fancied
himself
an
athlete
of
possibilities
and
a
supple
dancer
here
his
condition
was
perhaps
most
dangerous
he
granted
himself
personality
charm
magnetism
poise
the
power
of
dominating
all
contemporary
males
the
gift
of
fascinating
all
women
complete
unquestioned
superiority
now
a
confession
will
have
to
be
made
amory
had
rather
a
puritan
conscience
not
that
he
yielded
to
it
later
in
life
he
almost
completely
slew
it
but
at
fifteen
it
made
him
consider
himself
a
great
deal
worse
than
other
boys
unscrupulousness
the
desire
to
influence
people
in
almost
every
way
even
for
evil
a
certain
coldness
and
lack
of
affection
amounting
sometimes
to
cruelty
a
shifting
sense
of
honor
an
unholy
selfishness
a
puzzled
furtive
interest
in
everything
concerning
sex
there
was
also
a
curious
strain
of
weakness
running
crosswise
through
his
a
harsh
phrase
from
the
lips
of
an
older
boy
older
boys
usually
detested
him
was
liable
to
sweep
him
off
his
poise
into
surly
sensitiveness
or
timid
stupidity
he
was
a
slave
to
his
own
moods
and
he
felt
that
though
he
was
capable
of
recklessness
and
audacity
he
possessed
neither
courage
perseverance
nor
vanity
tempered
with
if
not
a
sense
of
people
as
automatons
to
his
will
a
desire
to
pass
as
many
boys
as
possible
and
get
to
a
vague
top
of
the
world
with
this
background
did
amory
drift
into
adolescence
preparatory
to
the
great
adventure
the
train
slowed
up
with
midsummer
languor
at
lake
geneva
and
amory
caught
sight
of
his
mother
waiting
in
her
electric
on
the
gravelled
station
drive
it
was
an
ancient
electric
one
of
the
early
types
and
painted
gray
the
sight
of
her
sitting
there
slenderly
erect
and
of
her
face
where
beauty
and
dignity
combined
melting
to
a
dreamy
recollected
smile
filled
him
with
a
sudden
great
pride
of
her
as
they
kissed
coolly
and
he
stepped
into
the
electric
he
felt
a
quick
fear
lest
he
had
lost
the
requisite
charm
to
measure
up
to
her
dear
boy
you
tall
look
behind
and
see
if
there
anything
coming
she
looked
left
and
right
she
slipped
cautiously
into
a
speed
of
two
miles
an
hour
beseeching
amory
to
act
as
sentinel
and
at
one
busy
crossing
she
made
him
get
out
and
run
ahead
to
signal
her
forward
like
a
traffic
policeman
beatrice
was
what
might
be
termed
a
careful
driver
you
tall
but
you
still
very
handsome
you
skipped
the
awkward
age
or
is
that
sixteen
perhaps
it
fourteen
or
fifteen
i
can
never
remember
but
you
skipped
do
embarrass
me
murmured
amory
but
my
dear
boy
what
odd
clothes
they
look
as
if
they
were
a
do
they
is
your
underwear
purple
too
amory
grunted
impolitely
you
must
go
to
brooks
and
get
some
really
nice
suits
oh
we
have
a
talk
or
perhaps
night
i
want
to
tell
you
about
your
heart
you
probably
been
neglecting
your
heart
and
you
amory
thought
how
superficial
was
the
recent
overlay
of
his
own
generation
aside
from
a
minute
shyness
he
felt
that
the
old
cynical
kinship
with
his
mother
had
not
been
one
bit
broken
yet
for
the
first
few
days
he
wandered
about
the
gardens
and
along
the
shore
in
a
state
of
superloneliness
finding
a
lethargic
content
in
smoking
bull
at
the
garage
with
one
of
the
chauffeurs
the
sixty
acres
of
the
estate
were
dotted
with
old
and
new
summer
houses
and
many
fountains
and
white
benches
that
came
suddenly
into
sight
from
there
was
a
great
and
constantly
increasing
family
of
white
cats
that
prowled
the
many
and
were
silhouetted
suddenly
at
night
against
the
darkening
trees
it
was
on
one
of
the
shadowy
paths
that
beatrice
at
last
captured
amory
after
blaine
had
as
usual
retired
for
the
evening
to
his
private
library
after
reproving
him
for
avoiding
her
she
took
him
for
a
long
in
the
moonlight
he
could
not
reconcile
himself
to
her
beauty
that
was
mother
to
his
own
the
exquisite
neck
and
shoulders
the
grace
of
a
fortunate
woman
of
thirty
amory
dear
she
crooned
softly
i
had
such
a
strange
weird
time
after
i
left
did
you
beatrice
when
i
had
my
last
breakdown
she
spoke
of
it
as
a
sturdy
gallant
feat
the
doctors
told
me
her
voice
sang
on
a
confidential
note
that
if
any
man
alive
had
done
the
consistent
drinking
that
i
have
he
would
have
been
physically
my
dear
and
in
his
long
in
his
amory
winced
and
wondered
how
this
would
have
sounded
to
froggy
parker
yes
continued
beatrice
tragically
i
had
dreams
wonderful
she
pressed
the
palms
of
her
hands
into
her
eyes
i
saw
bronze
rivers
lapping
marble
shores
and
great
birds
that
soared
through
the
air
birds
with
iridescent
plumage
i
heard
strange
music
and
the
flare
of
barbaric
trumpets
what
amory
had
snickered
what
amory
i
said
go
on
that
was
all
it
merely
recurred
and
recurred
gardens
that
flaunted
coloring
against
which
this
would
be
quite
dull
moons
that
whirled
and
swayed
paler
than
winter
moons
more
golden
than
harvest
moons
are
you
quite
well
now
beatrice
quite
well
as
well
as
i
will
ever
be
i
am
not
understood
amory
i
know
that
ca
express
it
to
you
amory
but
i
am
not
amory
was
quite
moved
he
put
his
arm
around
his
mother
rubbing
his
head
gently
against
her
shoulder
poor
beatrice
poor
tell
me
about
amory
did
you
have
two
years
amory
considered
lying
and
then
decided
against
it
no
beatrice
i
enjoyed
them
i
adapted
myself
to
the
bourgeoisie
i
became
he
surprised
himself
by
saying
that
and
he
pictured
how
froggy
would
have
gaped
beatrice
he
said
suddenly
i
want
to
go
away
to
school
everybody
in
minneapolis
is
going
to
go
away
to
beatrice
showed
some
alarm
but
you
only
yes
but
everybody
goes
away
to
school
at
fifteen
and
i
to
on
beatrice
suggestion
the
subject
was
dropped
for
the
rest
of
the
walk
but
a
week
later
she
delighted
him
by
saying
amory
i
have
decided
to
let
you
have
your
way
if
you
still
want
to
you
can
go
to
yes
to
regis
in
amory
felt
a
quick
excitement
it
being
arranged
continued
beatrice
it
better
that
you
should
go
away
i
have
preferred
you
to
have
gone
to
eton
and
then
to
christ
church
oxford
but
it
seems
impracticable
now
and
for
the
present
we
let
the
university
question
take
care
of
what
are
you
going
to
do
beatrice
heaven
knows
it
seems
my
fate
to
fret
away
my
years
in
this
country
not
for
a
second
do
i
regret
being
american
indeed
i
think
that
a
regret
typical
of
very
vulgar
people
and
i
feel
sure
we
are
the
great
coming
nation
yet
and
she
sighed
i
feel
my
life
should
have
drowsed
away
close
to
an
older
mellower
civilization
a
land
of
greens
and
autumnal
browns
amory
did
not
answer
so
his
mother
continued
my
regret
is
that
you
have
been
abroad
but
still
as
you
are
a
man
it
better
that
you
should
grow
up
here
under
the
snarling
eagle
is
that
the
right
term
amory
agreed
that
it
was
she
would
not
have
appreciated
the
japanese
invasion
when
do
i
go
to
school
next
month
you
have
to
start
east
a
little
early
to
take
your
examinations
after
that
you
have
a
free
week
so
i
want
you
to
go
up
the
hudson
and
pay
a
to
who
to
monsignor
darcy
amory
he
wants
to
see
you
he
went
to
harrow
and
then
to
yale
became
a
catholic
i
want
him
to
talk
to
you
i
feel
he
can
be
such
a
help
she
stroked
his
auburn
hair
gently
dear
amory
dear
amory
dear
beatrice
so
early
in
september
amory
provided
with
six
suits
summer
underwear
six
suits
winter
underwear
one
sweater
or
t
shirt
one
jersey
one
overcoat
winter
set
out
for
new
england
the
land
of
schools
there
were
andover
and
exeter
with
their
memories
of
new
england
dead
large
democracies
mark
groton

recruited
from
boston
and
the
knickerbocker
families
of
new

its

pomfret
and
george
prosperous

and
hotchkiss
which
prepared
the
wealth
of
the
middle

for
social

at
yale
pawling
westminster
choate
kent
and
a
hundred
others
all
milling
out
their
conventional
impressive
type
year
after
year
their
mental
stimulus
the
college
entrance
exams
their
vague
purpose
set
forth
in
a
hundred
circulars
as
to
impart
a
thorough
mental
moral
and
physical
training
as
a
christian
gentleman
to
fit
the
boy
for
meeting
the
problems
of
his
day
and
generation
and
to
give
a
solid
foundation
in
the
arts
and
at
regis
amory
stayed
three
days
and
took
his
exams
with
a
scoffing
confidence
then
doubling
back
to
new
york
to
pay
his
tutelary
visit
the
metropolis
barely
glimpsed
made
little
impression
on
him
except
for
the
sense
of
cleanliness
he
drew
from
the
tall
white
buildings
seen
from
a
hudson
river
steamboat
in
the
early
morning
indeed
his
mind
was
so
crowded
with
dreams
of
athletic
prowess
at
school
that
he
considered
this
visit
only
as
a
rather
tiresome
prelude
to
the
great
adventure
this
however
it
did
not
prove
to
be
monsignor
darcy
house
was
an
ancient
rambling
structure
set
on
a
hill
overlooking
the
river
and
there
lived
its
owner
between
his
trips
to
all
parts
of
the
world
rather
like
an
exiled
stuart
king
waiting
to
be
called
to
the
rule
of
his
land
monsignor
was
then
and
bustling
a
trifle
too
stout
for
symmetry
with
hair
the
color
of
spun
gold
and
a
brilliant
enveloping
personality
when
he
came
into
a
room
clad
in
his
full
purple
regalia
from
thatch
to
toe
he
resembled
a
turner
sunset
and
attracted
both
admiration
and
attention
he
had
written
two
novels
one
of
them
violently
just
before
his
conversion
and
five
years
later
another
in
which
he
had
attempted
to
turn
all
his
clever
jibes
against
catholics
into
even
cleverer
innuendoes
against
episcopalians
he
was
intensely
ritualistic
startlingly
dramatic
loved
the
idea
of
god
enough
to
be
a
celibate
and
rather
liked
his
neighbor
children
adored
him
because
he
was
like
a
child
youth
revelled
in
his
company
because
he
was
still
a
youth
and
could
be
shocked
in
the
proper
land
and
century
he
might
have
been
a
richelieu
at
present
he
was
a
very
moral
very
religious
if
not
particularly
pious
clergyman
making
a
great
mystery
about
pulling
rusty
wires
and
appreciating
life
to
the
fullest
if
not
entirely
enjoying
it
he
and
amory
took
to
each
other
at
first
sight
the
jovial
impressive
prelate
who
could
dazzle
an
embassy
ball
and
the
intent
youth
in
his
first
long
trousers
accepted
in
their
own
minds
a
relation
of
father
and
son
within
a
conversation
my
dear
boy
i
been
waiting
to
see
you
for
years
take
a
big
chair
and
we
have
a
i
just
come
from
school
regis
you
so
your
mother
says
a
remarkable
woman
have
a
cigarette
i
sure
you
smoke
well
if
you
like
me
you
loathe
all
science
and
mathematics
amory
nodded
vehemently
hate
all
like
english
and
of
course
you
hate
school
for
a
while
too
but
i
glad
going
to
why
because
it
a
gentleman
school
and
democracy
wo
hit
you
so
early
you
find
plenty
of
that
in
i
want
to
go
to
princeton
said
amory
i
do
know
why
but
i
think
of
all
harvard
men
as
sissies
like
i
used
to
be
and
all
yale
men
as
wearing
big
blue
sweaters
and
smoking
monsignor
chuckled
i
one
you
oh
you
different
i
think
of
princeton
as
being
lazy
and
and
aristocratic
you
know
like
a
spring
day
harvard
seems
sort
of
indoors
and
yale
is
november
crisp
and
energetic
finished
monsignor
that
they
slipped
briskly
into
an
intimacy
from
which
they
never
recovered
i
was
for
bonnie
prince
charlie
announced
amory
of
course
you
were
and
for
hannibal
yes
and
for
the
southern
he
was
rather
sceptical
about
being
an
irish
patriot
he
suspected
that
being
irish
was
being
somewhat
common
but
monsignor
assured
him
that
ireland
was
a
romantic
lost
cause
and
irish
people
quite
charming
and
that
it
should
by
all
means
be
one
of
his
principal
biasses
after
a
crowded
hour
which
included
several
more
cigarettes
and
during
which
monsignor
learned
to
his
surprise
but
not
to
his
horror
that
amory
had
not
been
brought
up
a
catholic
he
announced
that
he
had
another
guest
this
turned
out
to
be
the
honorable
thornton
hancock
of
boston
to
the
hague
author
of
an
erudite
history
of
the
middle
ages
and
the
last
of
a
distinguished
patriotic
and
brilliant
family
he
comes
here
for
a
rest
said
monsignor
confidentially
treating
amory
as
a
contemporary
i
act
as
an
escape
from
the
weariness
of
agnosticism
and
i
think
i
the
only
man
who
knows
how
his
staid
old
mind
is
really
at
sea
and
longs
for
a
sturdy
spar
like
the
church
to
cling
their
first
luncheon
was
one
of
the
memorable
events
of
amory
early
life
he
was
quite
radiant
and
gave
off
a
peculiar
brightness
and
charm
monsignor
called
out
the
best
that
he
had
thought
by
question
and
suggestion
and
amory
talked
with
an
ingenious
brilliance
of
a
thousand
impulses
and
desires
and
repulsions
and
faiths
and
fears
he
and
monsignor
held
the
floor
and
the
older
man
with
his
less
receptive
less
accepting
yet
certainly
not
colder
mentality
seemed
content
to
listen
and
bask
in
the
mellow
sunshine
that
played
between
these
two
monsignor
gave
the
effect
of
sunlight
to
many
people
amory
gave
it
in
his
youth
and
to
some
extent
when
he
was
very
much
older
but
never
again
was
it
quite
so
mutually
spontaneous
he
a
radiant
boy
thought
thornton
hancock
who
had
seen
the
splendor
of
two
continents
and
talked
with
parnell
and
gladstone
and
bismarck
and
afterward
he
added
to
monsignor
but
his
education
ought
not
to
be
intrusted
to
a
school
or
but
for
the
next
four
years
the
best
of
amory
intellect
was
concentrated
on
matters
of
popularity
the
intricacies
of
a
university
social
system
and
american
society
as
represented
by
biltmore
teas
and
hot
springs
in
all
a
wonderful
week
that
saw
amory
mind
turned
inside
out
a
hundred
of
his
theories
confirmed
and
his
joy
of
life
crystallized
to
a
thousand
ambitions
not
that
the
conversation
was
scholastic
heaven
forbid
amory
had
only
the
vaguest
idea
as
to
what
bernard
shaw
was
but
monsignor
made
quite
as
much
out
of
the
beloved
vagabond
and
sir
nigel
taking
good
care
that
amory
never
once
felt
out
of
his
depth
but
the
trumpets
were
sounding
for
amory
preliminary
skirmish
with
his
own
generation
you
not
sorry
to
go
of
course
with
people
like
us
our
home
is
where
we
are
not
said
monsignor
i
sorry
no
you
not
no
one
person
in
the
world
is
necessary
to
you
or
to
well
the
egotist
down
amory
two
years
at
regis
though
in
turn
painful
and
triumphant
had
as
little
real
significance
in
his
own
life
as
the
american
prep
school
crushed
as
it
is
under
the
heel
of
the
universities
has
to
american
life
in
general
we
have
no
eton
to
create
the
of
a
governing
class
we
have
instead
clean
flaccid
and
innocuous
preparatory
schools
he
went
all
wrong
at
the
start
was
generally
considered
both
conceited
and
arrogant
and
universally
detested
he
played
football
intensely
alternating
a
reckless
brilliancy
with
a
tendency
to
keep
himself
as
safe
from
hazard
as
decency
would
permit
in
a
wild
panic
he
backed
out
of
a
fight
with
a
boy
his
own
size
to
a
chorus
of
scorn
and
a
week
later
in
desperation
picked
a
battle
with
another
boy
very
much
bigger
from
which
he
emerged
badly
beaten
but
rather
proud
of
himself
he
was
resentful
against
all
those
in
authority
over
him
and
this
combined
with
a
lazy
indifference
toward
his
work
exasperated
every
master
in
school
he
grew
discouraged
and
imagined
himself
a
pariah
took
to
sulking
in
corners
and
reading
after
lights
with
a
dread
of
being
alone
he
attached
a
few
friends
but
since
they
were
not
among
the
elite
of
the
school
he
used
them
simply
as
mirrors
of
himself
audiences
before
which
he
might
do
that
posing
absolutely
essential
to
him
he
was
unbearably
lonely
desperately
unhappy
there
were
some
few
grains
of
comfort
whenever
amory
was
submerged
his
vanity
was
the
last
part
to
go
below
the
surface
so
he
could
still
enjoy
a
comfortable
glow
when
the
deaf
old
housekeeper
told
him
that
he
was
the
boy
she
had
ever
seen
it
had
pleased
him
to
be
the
lightest
and
youngest
man
on
the
first
football
squad
it
pleased
him
when
doctor
dougall
told
him
at
the
end
of
a
heated
conference
that
he
could
if
he
wished
get
the
best
marks
in
school
but
doctor
dougall
was
wrong
it
was
temperamentally
impossible
for
amory
to
get
the
best
marks
in
school
miserable
confined
to
bounds
unpopular
with
both
faculty
and
students
that
was
amory
first
term
but
at
christmas
he
had
returned
to
minneapolis
and
strangely
jubilant
oh
i
was
sort
of
fresh
at
first
he
told
frog
parker
patronizingly
but
i
got
along
fine
lightest
man
on
the
squad
you
ought
to
go
away
to
school
froggy
it
great
incident
of
the
professor
on
the
last
night
of
his
first
term
margotson
the
senior
master
sent
word
to
study
hall
that
amory
was
to
come
to
his
room
at
nine
amory
suspected
that
advice
was
forthcoming
but
he
determined
to
be
courteous
because
this
margotson
had
been
kindly
disposed
toward
him
his
summoner
received
him
gravely
and
motioned
him
to
a
chair
he
hemmed
several
times
and
looked
consciously
kind
as
a
man
will
when
he
knows
he
on
delicate
ground
amory
he
began
i
sent
for
you
on
a
personal
yes
i
noticed
you
this
year
and
i
i
like
you
i
think
you
have
in
you
the
makings
of
a
a
very
good
yes
sir
amory
managed
to
articulate
he
hated
having
people
talk
as
if
he
were
an
admitted
failure
but
i
noticed
continued
the
older
man
blindly
that
you
not
very
popular
with
the
no
amory
licked
his
lips
ah
i
thought
you
might
not
understand
exactly
what
it
was
they
ah
objected
to
i
going
to
tell
you
because
i
believe
ah
that
when
a
boy
knows
his
difficulties
he
better
able
to
cope
with
them
to
conform
to
what
others
expect
of
he
again
with
delicate
reticence
and
continued
they
seem
to
think
that
you
ah
rather
too
fresh
amory
could
stand
no
more
he
rose
from
his
chair
scarcely
controlling
his
voice
when
he
spoke
i
know
oh
you
i
his
voice
rose
i
know
what
they
think
do
you
you
have
to
me
he
paused
i
got
to
go
back
now
hope
i
not
rude
he
left
the
room
hurriedly
in
the
cool
air
outside
as
he
walked
to
his
house
he
exulted
in
his
refusal
to
be
helped
that
old
fool
he
cried
wildly
as
if
i
did
he
decided
however
that
this
was
a
good
excuse
not
to
go
back
to
study
hall
that
night
so
comfortably
couched
up
in
his
room
he
munched
nabiscos
and
finished
the
white
incident
of
the
wonderful
girl
there
was
a
bright
star
in
february
new
york
burst
upon
him
on
washington
birthday
with
the
brilliance
of
a
event
his
glimpse
of
it
as
a
vivid
whiteness
against
a
sky
had
left
a
picture
of
splendor
that
rivalled
the
dream
cities
in
the
arabian
nights
but
this
time
he
saw
it
by
electric
light
and
romance
gleamed
from
the
sign
on
broadway
and
from
the
women
eyes
at
the
astor
where
he
and
young
paskert
from
regis
had
dinner
when
they
walked
down
the
aisle
of
the
theatre
greeted
by
the
nervous
twanging
and
discord
of
untuned
violins
and
the
sensuous
heavy
fragrance
of
paint
and
powder
he
moved
in
a
sphere
of
epicurean
delight
everything
enchanted
him
the
play
was
the
little
millionaire
with
george
cohan
and
there
was
one
stunning
young
brunette
who
made
him
sit
with
brimming
eyes
in
the
ecstasy
of
watching
her
dance
oh
you
wonderful
girl
what
a
wonderful
girl
you
are
sang
the
tenor
and
amory
agreed
silently
but
passionately
all
your
wonderful
words
thrill
me
through
the
violins
swelled
and
quavered
on
the
last
notes
the
girl
sank
to
a
crumpled
butterfly
on
the
stage
a
great
burst
of
clapping
filled
the
house
oh
to
fall
in
love
like
that
to
the
languorous
magic
melody
of
such
a
tune
the
last
scene
was
laid
on
a
and
the
sighed
to
the
musical
moon
while
light
adventure
and
facile
comedy
flitted
back
and
forth
in
the
calcium
amory
was
on
fire
to
be
an
habitui
of
to
meet
a
girl
who
should
look
like
that
better
that
very
girl
whose
hair
would
be
drenched
with
golden
moonlight
while
at
his
elbow
sparkling
wine
was
poured
by
an
unintelligible
waiter
when
the
curtain
fell
for
the
last
time
he
gave
such
a
long
sigh
that
the
people
in
front
of
him
twisted
around
and
stared
and
said
loud
enough
for
him
to
hear
what
a
boy
this
took
his
mind
off
the
play
and
he
wondered
if
he
really
did
seem
handsome
to
the
population
of
new
york
paskert
and
he
walked
in
silence
toward
their
hotel
the
former
was
the
first
to
speak
his
uncertain
voice
broke
in
in
a
melancholy
strain
on
amory
musings
i
marry
that
girl
there
was
no
need
to
ask
what
girl
he
referred
to
i
be
proud
to
take
her
home
and
introduce
her
to
my
people
continued
paskert
amory
was
distinctly
impressed
he
wished
he
had
said
it
instead
of
paskert
it
sounded
so
mature
i
wonder
about
actresses
are
they
all
pretty
bad
no
not
by
a
darn
sight
said
the
worldly
youth
with
emphasis
and
i
know
that
girl
as
good
as
gold
i
can
they
wandered
on
mixing
in
the
broadway
crowd
dreaming
on
the
music
that
eddied
out
of
the
cafes
new
faces
flashed
on
and
off
like
myriad
lights
pale
or
rouged
faces
tired
yet
sustained
by
a
weary
excitement
amory
watched
them
in
fascination
he
was
planning
his
life
he
was
going
to
live
in
new
york
and
be
known
at
every
restaurant
and
cafe
wearing
a
from
early
evening
to
early
morning
sleeping
away
the
dull
hours
of
the
forenoon
yes
i
marry
that
girl
heroic
in
general
tone
october
of
his
second
and
last
year
at
regis
was
a
high
point
in
amory
memory
the
game
with
groton
was
played
from
three
of
a
snappy
exhilarating
afternoon
far
into
the
crisp
autumnal
twilight
and
amory
at
exhorting
in
wild
despair
making
impossible
tackles
calling
signals
in
a
voice
that
had
diminished
to
a
hoarse
furious
whisper
yet
found
time
to
revel
in
the
bandage
around
his
head
and
the
straining
glorious
heroism
of
plunging
crashing
bodies
and
aching
limbs
for
those
minutes
courage
flowed
like
wine
out
of
the
november
dusk
and
he
was
the
eternal
hero
one
with
the
on
the
prow
of
a
norse
galley
one
with
roland
and
horatius
sir
nigel
and
ted
coy
scraped
and
stripped
into
trim
and
then
flung
by
his
own
will
into
the
breach
beating
back
the
tide
hearing
from
afar
the
thunder
of
cheers
finally
bruised
and
weary
but
still
elusive
circling
an
end
twisting
changing
pace
falling
behind
the
groton
goal
with
two
men
on
his
legs
in
the
only
touchdown
of
the
game
the
philosophy
of
the
slicker
from
the
scoffing
superiority
of
year
and
success
amory
looked
back
with
cynical
wonder
on
his
status
of
the
year
before
he
was
changed
as
completely
as
amory
blaine
could
ever
be
changed
amory
plus
beatrice
plus
two
years
in
minneapolis
these
had
been
his
ingredients
when
he
entered
regis
but
the
minneapolis
years
were
not
a
thick
enough
overlay
to
conceal
the
amory
plus
beatrice
from
the
ferreting
eyes
of
a
so
regis
had
very
painfully
drilled
beatrice
out
of
him
and
begun
to
lay
down
new
and
more
conventional
planking
on
the
fundamental
amory
but
both
regis
and
amory
were
unconscious
of
the
fact
that
this
fundamental
amory
had
not
in
himself
changed
those
qualities
for
which
he
had
suffered
his
moodiness
his
tendency
to
pose
his
laziness
and
his
love
of
playing
the
fool
were
now
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
recognized
eccentricities
in
a
star
a
clever
actor
and
the
editor
of
the
regis
tattler
it
puzzled
him
to
see
impressionable
small
boys
imitating
the
very
vanities
that
had
not
long
ago
been
contemptible
weaknesses
after
the
football
season
he
slumped
into
dreamy
content
the
night
of
the
dance
he
slipped
away
and
went
early
to
bed
for
the
pleasure
of
hearing
the
violin
music
cross
the
grass
and
come
surging
in
at
his
window
many
nights
he
lay
there
dreaming
awake
of
secret
cafes
in
mont
martre
where
ivory
women
delved
in
romantic
mysteries
with
diplomats
and
soldiers
of
fortune
while
orchestras
played
hungarian
waltzes
and
the
air
was
thick
and
exotic
with
intrigue
and
moonlight
and
adventure
in
the
spring
he
read
by
request
and
was
inspired
to
lyrical
outpourings
on
the
subject
of
arcady
and
the
pipes
of
pan
he
moved
his
bed
so
that
the
sun
would
wake
him
at
dawn
that
he
might
dress
and
go
out
to
the
archaic
swing
that
hung
from
an
near
the
house
seating
himself
in
this
he
would
pump
higher
and
higher
until
he
got
the
effect
of
swinging
into
the
wide
air
into
a
fairyland
of
piping
satyrs
and
nymphs
with
the
faces
of
girls
he
passed
in
the
streets
of
eastchester
as
the
swing
reached
its
highest
point
arcady
really
lay
just
over
the
brow
of
a
certain
hill
where
the
brown
road
dwindled
out
of
sight
in
a
golden
dot
he
read
voluminously
all
spring
the
beginning
of
his
eighteenth
year
the
gentleman
from
indiana
the
new
arabian
nights
the
morals
of
marcus
ordeyne
the
man
who
was
thursday
which
he
liked
without
understanding
stover
at
yale
that
became
somewhat
of
a
dombey
and
son
because
he
thought
he
really
should
read
better
stuff
robert
chambers
david
graham
phillips
and
phillips
oppenheim
complete
and
a
scattering
of
tennyson
and
kipling
of
all
his
class
work
only
and
some
quality
of
rigid
clarity
in
solid
geometry
stirred
his
languid
interest
as
june
drew
near
he
felt
the
need
of
conversation
to
formulate
his
own
ideas
and
to
his
surprise
found
a
in
rahill
the
president
of
the
sixth
form
in
many
a
talk
on
the
highroad
or
lying
along
the
edge
of
the
baseball
diamond
or
late
at
night
with
their
cigarettes
glowing
in
the
dark
they
threshed
out
the
questions
of
school
and
there
was
developed
the
term
got
tobacco
whispered
rahill
one
night
putting
his
head
inside
the
door
five
minutes
after
lights
i
coming
take
a
couple
of
pillows
and
lie
in
the
why
do
amory
sat
up
in
bed
and
lit
a
cigarette
while
rahill
settled
for
a
conversation
rahill
favorite
subject
was
the
respective
futures
of
the
sixth
form
and
amory
never
tired
of
outlining
them
for
his
benefit
ted
converse
easy
he
fail
his
exams
tutor
all
summer
at
harstrum
get
into
sheff
with
about
four
conditions
and
flunk
out
in
the
middle
of
the
freshman
year
then
he
go
back
west
and
raise
hell
for
a
year
or
so
finally
his
father
will
make
him
go
into
the
paint
business
he
marry
and
have
four
sons
all
bone
heads
he
always
think
regis
spoiled
him
so
he
send
his
sons
to
day
school
in
portland
he
die
of
locomotor
ataxia
when
he
and
his
wife
will
give
a
baptizing
stand
or
whatever
you
call
it
to
the
presbyterian
church
with
his
name
on
it
hold
up
amory
that
too
darned
gloomy
how
about
yourself
i
in
a
superior
class
you
are
too
we
i
sure
you
are
you
got
a
darn
good
head
on
but
amory
knew
that
nothing
in
the
abstract
no
theory
or
generality
ever
moved
rahill
until
he
stubbed
his
toe
upon
the
concrete
minutiae
of
it
have
insisted
rahill
i
let
people
impose
on
me
here
and
get
anything
out
of
it
i
the
prey
of
my
friends
damn
it
do
their
lessons
get
out
of
trouble
pay
stupid
summer
visits
and
always
entertain
their
kid
sisters
keep
my
temper
when
they
get
selfish
and
then
they
think
they
pay
me
back
by
voting
for
me
and
telling
me
the
man
of
regis
i
want
to
get
where
everybody
does
their
own
work
and
i
can
tell
people
where
to
go
i
tired
of
being
nice
to
every
poor
fish
in
you
not
a
slicker
said
amory
suddenly
a
what
a
what
the
devil
that
well
it
something
that
that
there
a
lot
of
them
you
not
one
and
neither
am
i
though
i
am
more
than
you
who
is
one
what
makes
you
one
amory
considered
why
why
i
suppose
that
the
of
it
is
when
a
fellow
slicks
his
hair
back
with
like
carstairs
yes
sure
he
a
they
spent
two
evenings
getting
an
exact
definition
the
slicker
was
or
he
had
brains
social
brains
that
is
and
he
used
all
means
on
the
broad
path
of
honesty
to
get
ahead
be
popular
admired
and
never
in
trouble
he
dressed
well
was
particularly
neat
in
appearance
and
derived
his
name
from
the
fact
that
his
hair
was
inevitably
worn
short
soaked
in
water
or
tonic
parted
in
the
middle
and
slicked
back
as
the
current
of
fashion
dictated
the
slickers
of
that
year
had
adopted
spectacles
as
badges
of
their
slickerhood
and
this
made
them
so
easy
to
recognize
that
amory
and
rahill
never
missed
one
the
slicker
seemed
distributed
through
school
always
a
little
wiser
and
shrewder
than
his
contemporaries
managing
some
team
or
other
and
keeping
his
cleverness
carefully
concealed
amory
found
the
slicker
a
most
valuable
classification
until
his
junior
year
in
college
when
the
outline
became
so
blurred
and
indeterminate
that
it
had
to
be
subdivided
many
times
and
became
only
a
quality
amory
secret
ideal
had
all
the
slicker
qualifications
but
in
addition
courage
and
tremendous
brains
and
talents
also
amory
conceded
him
a
bizarre
streak
that
was
quite
irreconcilable
to
the
slicker
proper
this
was
a
first
real
break
from
the
hypocrisy
of
school
tradition
the
slicker
was
a
definite
element
of
success
differing
intrinsically
from
the
prep
school
big
the
slicker
clever
sense
of
social
values
dresses
well
pretends
that
dress
is
superficial
but
knows
that
it
is
goes
into
such
activities
as
he
can
shine
in
gets
to
college
and
is
in
a
worldly
way
successful
hair
slicked
the
big
man
inclined
to
stupidity
and
unconscious
of
social
values
thinks
dress
is
superficial
and
is
inclined
to
be
careless
about
it
goes
out
for
everything
from
a
sense
of
duty
gets
to
college
and
has
a
problematical
future
feels
lost
without
his
circle
and
always
says
that
school
days
were
happiest
after
all
goes
back
to
school
and
makes
speeches
about
what
regis
boys
are
doing
hair
not
slicked
amory
had
decided
definitely
on
princeton
even
though
he
would
be
the
only
boy
entering
that
year
from
regis
yale
had
a
romance
and
glamour
from
the
tales
of
minneapolis
and
regis
men
who
had
been
tapped
for
skull
and
bones
but
princeton
drew
him
most
with
its
atmosphere
of
bright
colors
and
its
alluring
reputation
as
the
pleasantest
country
club
in
america
dwarfed
by
the
menacing
college
exams
amory
school
days
drifted
into
the
past
years
afterward
when
he
went
back
to
regis
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
successes
of
year
and
to
be
able
to
picture
himself
only
as
the
unadjustable
boy
who
had
hurried
down
corridors
jeered
at
by
his
rabid
contemporaries
mad
with
common
sense
chapter
spires
and
gargoyles
at
first
amory
noticed
only
the
wealth
of
sunshine
creeping
across
the
long
green
swards
dancing
on
the
leaded
and
swimming
around
the
tops
of
spires
and
towers
and
battlemented
walls
gradually
he
realized
that
he
was
really
walking
up
university
place
about
his
suitcase
developing
a
new
tendency
to
glare
straight
ahead
when
he
passed
any
one
several
times
he
could
have
sworn
that
men
turned
to
look
at
him
critically
he
wondered
vaguely
if
there
was
something
the
matter
with
his
clothes
and
wished
he
had
shaved
that
morning
on
the
train
he
felt
unnecessarily
stiff
and
awkward
among
these
bareheaded
youths
who
must
be
juniors
and
seniors
judging
from
the
savoir
faire
with
which
they
strolled
he
found
that
university
place
was
a
large
dilapidated
mansion
at
present
apparently
uninhabited
though
he
knew
it
housed
usually
a
dozen
freshmen
after
a
hurried
skirmish
with
his
landlady
he
sallied
out
on
a
tour
of
exploration
but
he
had
gone
scarcely
a
block
when
he
became
horribly
conscious
that
he
must
be
the
only
man
in
town
who
was
wearing
a
hat
he
returned
hurriedly
to
university
left
his
derby
and
emerging
bareheaded
loitered
down
nassau
street
stopping
to
investigate
a
display
of
athletic
photographs
in
a
store
window
including
a
large
one
of
allenby
the
football
captain
and
next
attracted
by
the
sign
jigger
shop
over
a
confectionary
window
this
sounded
familiar
so
he
sauntered
in
and
took
a
seat
on
a
high
stool
chocolate
sundae
he
told
a
colored
person
double
chocolate
jiggah
anything
else
why
bacon
bun
why
he
munched
four
of
these
finding
them
of
pleasing
savor
and
then
consumed
another
jigger
before
ease
descended
upon
him
after
a
cursory
inspection
of
the
leather
pennants
and
gibson
girls
that
lined
the
walls
he
left
and
continued
along
nassau
street
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
gradually
he
was
learning
to
distinguish
between
upper
classmen
and
entering
men
even
though
the
freshman
cap
would
not
appear
until
the
following
monday
those
who
were
too
obviously
too
nervously
at
home
were
freshmen
for
as
each
train
brought
a
new
contingent
it
was
immediately
absorbed
into
the
hatless
throng
whose
function
seemed
to
be
to
drift
endlessly
up
and
down
the
street
emitting
great
clouds
of
smoke
from
pipes
by
afternoon
amory
realized
that
now
the
newest
arrivals
were
taking
him
for
an
upper
classman
and
he
tried
conscientiously
to
look
both
pleasantly
blasé
and
casually
critical
which
was
as
near
as
he
could
analyze
the
prevalent
facial
expression
at
five
he
felt
the
need
of
hearing
his
own
voice
so
he
retreated
to
his
house
to
see
if
any
one
else
had
arrived
having
climbed
the
rickety
stairs
he
scrutinized
his
room
resignedly
concluding
that
it
was
hopeless
to
attempt
any
more
inspired
decoration
than
class
banners
and
tiger
pictures
there
was
a
tap
at
the
door
come
in
a
slim
face
with
gray
eyes
and
a
humorous
smile
appeared
in
the
doorway
got
a
hammer
no
sorry
maybe
twelve
or
whatever
she
goes
by
has
the
stranger
advanced
into
the
room
you
an
inmate
of
this
asylum
amory
nodded
awful
barn
for
the
rent
we
amory
had
to
agree
that
it
was
i
thought
of
the
campus
he
said
but
they
say
there
so
few
freshmen
that
they
lost
have
to
sit
around
and
study
for
something
to
the
man
decided
to
introduce
himself
my
name
blaine
my
they
shook
hands
with
the
fashionable
low
swoop
amory
grinned
where
you
prep
andover
where
did
you
st
oh
did
you
i
had
a
cousin
they
discussed
the
cousin
thoroughly
and
then
holiday
announced
that
he
was
to
meet
his
brother
for
dinner
at
six
come
along
and
have
a
bite
with
all
at
the
kenilworth
amory
met
burne
holiday
he
of
the
gray
eyes
was
kerry
and
during
a
limpid
meal
of
thin
soup
and
anaemic
vegetables
they
stared
at
the
other
freshmen
who
sat
either
in
small
groups
looking
very
ill
at
ease
or
in
large
groups
seeming
very
much
at
home
i
hear
commons

pretty
bad
said
amory
that
the
rumor
but
you
got
to
eat
there
or
pay
crime
imposition
oh
at
princeton
you
got
to
swallow
everything
the
first
year
like
a
damned
prep
amory
agreed
lot
of
pep
though
he
insisted
i
would
have
gone
to
yale
for
a
me

going
out
for
anything
inquired
amory
of
the
elder
brother
not
me
burne
here

going
out
for
the
prince
the
daily
princetonian
you
yes
i
you
going
out
for
anything
why
yes
i
going
to
take
a
whack
at
freshman
play
at
regis
some
admitted
amory
depreciatingly
but
i
getting
so
damned
you
not
well
i
used
to
be
stocky
last
oh
after
supper
they
attended
the
movies
where
amory
was
fascinated
by
the
glib
comments
of
a
man
in
front
of
him
as
well
as
by
the
wild
yelling
and
shouting
yoho
oh
you
so
big
and
strong
but
oh
so
gentle
clinch
oh
clinch
kiss
her
kiss
lady
quick
a
group
began
whistling
by
the
sea
and
the
audience
took
it
up
noisily
this
was
followed
by
an
indistinguishable
song
that
included
much
stamping
and
then
by
an
endless
incoherent
dirge
she
works
in
a
jam
factoree
and
but
you
for
i
know
damn
well
that
she
as
they
pushed
out
giving
and
receiving
curious
impersonal
glances
amory
decided
that
he
liked
the
movies
wanted
to
enjoy
them
as
the
row
of
upper
classmen
in
front
had
enjoyed
them
with
their
arms
along
the
backs
of
the
seats
their
comments
gaelic
and
caustic
their
attitude
a
mixture
of
critical
wit
and
tolerant
amusement
want
a
sundae
i
mean
a
jigger
asked
kerry
they
suppered
heavily
and
then
still
sauntering
eased
back
to
wonderful
it
a
you
men
going
to
unpack
guess
so
come
on
amory
decided
to
sit
for
a
while
on
the
front
steps
so
he
bade
them
good
night
the
great
tapestries
of
trees
had
darkened
to
ghosts
back
at
the
last
edge
of
twilight
the
early
moon
had
drenched
the
arches
with
pale
blue
and
weaving
over
the
night
in
and
out
of
the
gossamer
rifts
of
moon
swept
a
song
a
song
with
more
than
a
hint
of
sadness
infinitely
transient
infinitely
regretful
he
remembered
that
an
alumnus
of
the
nineties
had
told
him
of
one
of
booth
tarkington
amusements
standing
in
in
the
small
hours
and
singing
tenor
songs
to
the
stars
arousing
mingled
emotions
in
the
couched
undergraduates
according
to
the
sentiment
of
their
moods
now
far
down
the
shadowy
line
of
university
place
a
phalanx
broke
the
gloom
and
marching
figures
swung
rhythmically
up
the
street
with
linked
arms
and
heads
thrown
back
going
back
going
back
going
back
to
hall
going
back
going
back
to
the
best
old
place
of
all
going
back
going
back
from
all
this
ball
we
clear
the
track
as
we
go
back
going
back
to
hall
amory
closed
his
eyes
as
the
ghostly
procession
drew
near
the
song
soared
so
high
that
all
dropped
out
except
the
tenors
who
bore
the
melody
triumphantly
past
the
and
relinquished
it
to
the
fantastic
chorus
then
amory
opened
his
eyes
half
afraid
that
sight
would
spoil
the
rich
illusion
of
harmony
he
sighed
eagerly
there
at
the
head
of
the
white
platoon
marched
allenby
the
football
captain
slim
and
defiant
as
if
aware
that
this
year
the
hopes
of
the
college
rested
on
him
that
his
pounds
were
expected
to
dodge
to
victory
through
the
heavy
blue
and
crimson
lines
fascinated
amory
watched
each
rank
of
linked
arms
as
it
came
abreast
the
faces
indistinct
above
the
polo
shirts
the
voices
blent
in
a
paean
of
triumph
and
then
the
procession
passed
through
shadowy
campbell
arch
and
the
voices
grew
fainter
as
it
wound
eastward
over
the
campus
the
minutes
passed
and
amory
sat
there
very
quietly
he
regretted
the
rule
that
would
forbid
freshmen
to
be
outdoors
after
curfew
for
he
wanted
to
ramble
through
the
shadowy
scented
lanes
where
witherspoon
brooded
like
a
dark
mother
over
whig
and
clio
her
attic
children
where
the
black
gothic
snake
of
little
curled
down
to
cuyler
and
patton
these
in
turn
flinging
the
mystery
out
over
the
placid
slope
rolling
to
the
lake
princeton
of
the
daytime
filtered
slowly
into
his
consciousness
west
and
reunion
redolent
of
the
sixties
hall
and
arrogant
upper
and
lower
pyne
aristocratic
elizabethan
ladies
not
quite
content
to
live
among
shopkeepers
and
topping
all
climbing
with
clear
blue
aspiration
the
great
dreaming
spires
of
holder
and
cleveland
towers
from
the
first
he
loved
princeton
its
lazy
beauty
its
significance
the
wild
moonlight
revel
of
the
rushes
the
handsome
prosperous
crowds
and
under
it
all
the
air
of
struggle
that
pervaded
his
class
from
the
day
when
and
exhausted
the
jerseyed
freshmen
sat
in
the
gymnasium
and
elected
some
one
from
hill
school
class
president
a
lawrenceville
celebrity
a
hockey
star
from
paul
secretary
up
until
the
end
of
sophomore
year
it
never
ceased
that
breathless
social
system
that
worship
seldom
named
never
really
admitted
of
the
bogey
big
first
it
was
schools
and
amory
alone
from
regis
watched
the
crowds
form
and
widen
and
form
again
paul
hill
pomfret
eating
at
certain
tacitly
reserved
tables
in
commons
dressing
in
their
own
corners
of
the
gymnasium
and
drawing
unconsciously
about
them
a
barrier
of
the
slightly
less
important
but
socially
ambitious
to
protect
them
from
the
friendly
rather
puzzled
element
from
the
moment
he
realized
this
amory
resented
social
barriers
as
artificial
distinctions
made
by
the
strong
to
bolster
up
their
weak
retainers
and
keep
out
the
almost
strong
having
decided
to
be
one
of
the
gods
of
the
class
he
reported
for
freshman
football
practice
but
in
the
second
week
playing
already
paragraphed
in
corners
of
the
princetonian
he
wrenched
his
knee
seriously
enough
to
put
him
out
for
the
rest
of
the
season
this
forced
him
to
retire
and
consider
the
situation
univee
housed
a
dozen
miscellaneous
there
were
three
or
four
inconspicuous
and
quite
startled
boys
from
lawrenceville
two
amateur
wild
men
from
a
new
york
private
school
kerry
holiday
christened
them
the
plebeian
drunks
a
jewish
youth
also
from
new
york
and
as
compensation
for
amory
the
two
holidays
to
whom
he
took
an
instant
fancy
the
holidays
were
rumored
twins
but
really
the
one
kerry
was
a
year
older
than
his
blond
brother
burne
kerry
was
tall
with
humorous
gray
eyes
and
a
sudden
attractive
smile
he
became
at
once
the
mentor
of
the
house
reaper
of
ears
that
grew
too
high
censor
of
conceit
vendor
of
rare
satirical
humor
amory
spread
the
table
of
their
future
friendship
with
all
his
ideas
of
what
college
should
and
did
mean
kerry
not
inclined
as
yet
to
take
things
seriously
chided
him
gently
for
being
curious
at
this
inopportune
time
about
the
intricacies
of
the
social
system
but
liked
him
and
was
both
interested
and
amused
burne
silent
and
intent
appeared
in
the
house
only
as
a
busy
apparition
gliding
in
quietly
at
night
and
off
again
in
the
early
morning
to
get
up
his
work
in
the
library
he
was
out
for
the
princetonian
competing
furiously
against
forty
others
for
the
coveted
first
place
in
december
he
came
down
with
diphtheria
and
some
one
else
won
the
competition
but
returning
to
college
in
february
he
dauntlessly
went
after
the
prize
again
necessarily
acquaintance
with
him
was
in
the
way
of
chats
walking
to
and
from
lectures
so
he
failed
to
penetrate
burne
one
absorbing
interest
and
find
what
lay
beneath
it
amory
was
far
from
contented
he
missed
the
place
he
had
won
at
regis
the
being
known
and
admired
yet
princeton
stimulated
him
and
there
were
many
things
ahead
calculated
to
arouse
the
machiavelli
latent
in
him
could
he
but
insert
a
wedge
the
clubs
concerning
which
he
had
pumped
a
reluctant
graduate
during
the
previous
summer
excited
his
curiosity
ivy
detached
and
breathlessly
aristocratic
cottage
an
impressive
mélange
of
brilliant
adventurers
and
philanderers
tiger
inn
and
athletic
vitalized
by
an
honest
elaboration
of
standards
cap
and
gown
faintly
religious
and
politically
powerful
flamboyant
colonial
literary
quadrangle
and
the
dozen
others
varying
in
age
and
position
anything
which
brought
an
under
classman
into
too
glaring
a
light
was
labelled
with
the
damning
brand
of
running
it
the
movies
thrived
on
caustic
comments
but
the
men
who
made
them
were
generally
running
it
out
talking
of
clubs
was
running
it
out
standing
for
anything
very
strongly
as
for
instance
drinking
parties
or
teetotalling
was
running
it
out
in
short
being
personally
conspicuous
was
not
tolerated
and
the
influential
man
was
the
man
until
at
club
elections
in
sophomore
year
every
one
should
be
sewed
up
in
some
bag
for
the
rest
of
his
college
career
amory
found
that
writing
for
the
nassau
literary
magazine
would
get
him
nothing
but
that
being
on
the
board
of
the
daily
princetonian
would
get
any
one
a
good
deal
his
vague
desire
to
do
immortal
acting
with
the
english
dramatic
association
faded
out
when
he
found
that
the
most
ingenious
brains
and
talents
were
concentrated
upon
the
triangle
club
a
musical
comedy
organization
that
every
year
took
a
great
christmas
trip
in
the
meanwhile
feeling
strangely
alone
and
restless
in
commons
with
new
desires
and
ambitions
stirring
in
his
mind
he
let
the
first
term
go
by
between
an
envy
of
the
embryo
successes
and
a
puzzled
fretting
with
kerry
as
to
why
they
were
not
accepted
immediately
among
the
elite
of
the
class
many
afternoons
they
lounged
in
the
windows
of
univee
and
watched
the
class
pass
to
and
from
commons
noting
satellites
already
attaching
themselves
to
the
more
prominent
watching
the
lonely
grind
with
his
hurried
step
and
downcast
eye
envying
the
happy
security
of
the
big
school
groups
we
the
damned
middle
class
that
what
he
complained
to
kerry
one
day
as
he
lay
stretched
out
on
the
sofa
consuming
a
family
of
fatimas
with
contemplative
precision
well
why
not
we
came
to
princeton
so
we
could
feel
that
way
toward
the
small
colleges
have
it
on
more
dress
better
cut
a
swathe
oh
it
is
that
i
mind
the
glittering
caste
system
admitted
amory
i
like
having
a
bunch
of
hot
cats
on
top
but
gosh
kerry
i
got
to
be
one
of
but
just
now
amory
you
only
a
sweaty
amory
lay
for
a
moment
without
speaking
i
wo
be
long
he
said
finally
but
i
hate
to
get
anywhere
by
working
for
it
i
show
the
marks
do
you
honorable
kerry
craned
his
neck
suddenly
at
the
street
there
langueduc
if
you
want
to
see
what
he
looks
like
and
humbird
just
amory
rose
dynamically
and
sought
the
windows
oh
he
said
scrutinizing
these
worthies
humbird
looks
like
a
but
this
langueduc
he
the
rugged
type
is
he
i
distrust
that
sort
all
diamonds
look
big
in
the
well
said
kerry
as
the
excitement
subsided
you
a
literary
genius
it
up
to
i
wonder
amory
paused
if
i
could
be
i
honestly
think
so
sometimes
that
sounds
like
the
devil
and
i
would
say
it
to
anybody
except
well
go
ahead
let
your
hair
grow
and
write
poems
like
this
guy
in
the
amory
reached
lazily
at
a
pile
of
magazines
on
the
table
read
his
latest
effort
never
miss
they
amory
glanced
through
the
issue
hello
he
said
in
surprise
he
a
freshman
is
he
listen
to
this
my
god
serving
lady
speaks
black
velvet
trails
its
folds
over
the
day
white
tapers
prisoned
in
their
silver
frames
wave
their
thin
flames
like
shadows
in
the
wind
pia
pompia
come
come
away
now
what
the
devil
does
that
mean
it
a
pantry
toes
are
stiffened
like
a
stork
in
flight
she
laid
upon
her
bed
on
the
white
sheets
her
hands
pressed
on
her
smooth
bust
like
a
saint
bella
cunizza
come
into
the
light
my
gosh
kerry
what
in
hell
is
it
all
about
i
swear
i
do
get
him
at
all
and
i
a
literary
bird
it
pretty
tricky
said
kerry
only
you
got
to
think
of
hearses
and
stale
milk
when
you
read
it
that
is
as
pash
as
some
of
amory
tossed
the
magazine
on
the
table
well
he
sighed
i
sure
am
up
in
the
air
i
know
i
not
a
regular
fellow
yet
i
loathe
anybody
else
that
is
i
ca
decide
whether
to
cultivate
my
mind
and
be
a
great
dramatist
or
to
thumb
my
nose
at
the
golden
treasury
and
be
a
princeton
why
decide
suggested
kerry
better
drift
like
me
i
going
to
sail
into
prominence
on
burne
i
ca
drift
i
want
to
be
interested
i
want
to
pull
strings
even
for
somebody
else
or
be
princetonian
chairman
or
triangle
president
i
want
to
be
admired
you
thinking
too
much
about
amory
sat
up
at
this
no
i
thinking
about
you
too
we
got
to
get
out
and
mix
around
the
class
right
now
when
it
fun
to
be
a
snob
i
like
to
bring
a
sardine
to
the
prom
in
june
for
instance
but
i
would
do
it
unless
i
could
be
damn
debonaire
about
it
introduce
her
to
all
the
prize
and
the
football
captain
and
all
that
simple
amory
said
kerry
impatiently
you
just
going
around
in
a
circle
if
you
want
to
be
prominent
get
out
and
try
for
something
if
you
do
just
take
it
he
yawned
come
on
let
let
the
smoke
drift
off
we
go
down
and
watch
football
amory
gradually
accepted
this
point
of
view
decided
that
next
fall
would
inaugurate
his
career
and
relinquished
himself
to
watching
kerry
extract
joy
from
univee
they
filled
the
jewish
youth
bed
with
lemon
pie
they
put
out
the
gas
all
over
the
house
every
night
by
blowing
into
the
jet
in
amory
room
to
the
bewilderment
of
twelve
and
the
local
plumber
they
set
up
the
effects
of
the
plebeian
drunks
pictures
books
and
furniture
in
the
bathroom
to
the
confusion
of
the
pair
who
hazily
discovered
the
transposition
on
their
return
from
a
trenton
spree
they
were
disappointed
beyond
measure
when
the
plebeian
drunks
decided
to
take
it
as
a
joke
they
played
and
and
jackpot
from
dinner
to
dawn
and
on
the
occasion
of
one
man
birthday
persuaded
him
to
buy
sufficient
champagne
for
a
hilarious
celebration
the
donor
of
the
party
having
remained
sober
kerry
and
amory
accidentally
dropped
him
down
two
flights
of
stairs
and
called
and
penitent
at
the
infirmary
all
the
following
week
say
who
are
all
these
women
demanded
kerry
one
day
protesting
at
the
size
of
amory
mail
i
been
looking
at
the
postmarks
lately
farmington
and
dobbs
and
westover
and
dana
hall
what
the
idea
amory
grinned
all
from
the
twin
he
named
them
off
there
marylyn
de
witt
she
pretty
got
a
car
of
her
own
and
that
damn
convenient

myra
claire
she
an
old
flame
easy
to
kiss
if
you

it
what
line
do
you
throw
demanded
kerry
i
tried
everything
and
the
mad
wags
are
even
afraid
of
you
the
boy
type
suggested
amory
that
just
it
mother
always
feels
the
girl
is
safe
if
she
with
me
honestly
it
annoying
if
i
start
to
hold
somebody
hand
they
laugh
at
me
and
let
me
just
as
if
it
was
part
of
them
as
soon
as
i
get
hold
of
a
hand
they
sort
of
disconnect
it
from
the
rest
of
sulk
suggested
amory
tell
you
wild
and
have
reform
you
go
home
furious
come
back
in
half
an
hour
startle
kerry
shook
his
head
no
chance
i
wrote
a
timothy
girl
a
really
loving
letter
last
year
in
one
place
i
got
rattled
and
said
god
how
i
love
you
she
took
a
nail
scissors
clipped
out
the
god
and
showed
the
rest
of
the
letter
all
over
school
does
work
at
all
i
just
old
and
all
that
amory
smiled
and
tried
to
picture
himself
as
good
old
he
failed
completely
february
dripped
snow
and
rain
the
cyclonic
freshman
passed
and
life
in
univee
continued
interesting
if
not
purposeful
once
a
day
amory
indulged
in
a
club
sandwich
cornflakes
and
julienne
potatoes
at
joe
accompanied
usually
by
kerry
or
alec
connage
the
latter
was
a
quiet
rather
aloof
slicker
from
hotchkiss
who
lived
next
door
and
shared
the
same
enforced
singleness
as
amory
due
to
the
fact
that
his
entire
class
had
gone
to
yale
joe
was
unaesthetic
and
faintly
unsanitary
but
a
limitless
charge
account
could
be
opened
there
a
convenience
that
amory
appreciated
his
father
had
been
experimenting
with
mining
stocks
and
in
consequence
his
allowance
while
liberal
was
not
at
all
what
he
had
expected
joe
had
the
additional
advantage
of
seclusion
from
curious
eyes
so
at
four
each
afternoon
amory
accompanied
by
friend
or
book
went
up
to
experiment
with
his
digestion
one
day
in
march
finding
that
all
the
tables
were
occupied
he
slipped
into
a
chair
opposite
a
freshman
who
bent
intently
over
a
book
at
the
last
table
they
nodded
briefly
for
twenty
minutes
amory
sat
consuming
bacon
buns
and
reading
mrs
warren
profession
he
had
discovered
shaw
quite
by
accident
while
browsing
in
the
library
during
the
other
freshman
also
intent
on
his
volume
meanwhile
did
away
with
a
trio
of
chocolate
malted
milks
by
and
by
amory
eyes
wandered
curiously
to
his
book
he
spelled
out
the
name
and
title
upside
down
marpessa
by
stephen
phillips
this
meant
nothing
to
him
his
metrical
education
having
been
confined
to
such
sunday
classics
as
come
into
the
garden
maude
and
what
morsels
of
shakespeare
and
milton
had
been
recently
forced
upon
him
moved
to
address
his
he
simulated
interest
in
his
book
for
a
moment
and
then
exclaimed
aloud
as
if
involuntarily
ha
great
stuff
the
other
freshman
looked
up
and
amory
registered
artificial
embarrassment
are
you
referring
to
your
bacon
buns
his
cracked
kindly
voice
went
well
with
the
large
spectacles
and
the
impression
of
a
voluminous
keenness
that
he
gave
no
amory
answered
i
was
referring
to
bernard
he
turned
the
book
around
in
explanation
i
never
read
any
shaw
i
always
meant
the
boy
paused
and
then
continued
did
you
ever
read
stephen
phillips
or
do
you
like
poetry
yes
indeed
amory
affirmed
eagerly
i
never
read
much
of
phillips
he
had
never
heard
of
any
phillips
except
the
late
david
graham
it
pretty
fair
i
think
of
course
he
a
they
sallied
into
a
discussion
of
poetry
in
the
course
of
which
they
introduced
themselves
and
amory
companion
proved
to
be
none
other
than
that
awful
highbrow
thomas
parke
who
signed
the
passionate
in
the
lit
he
was
perhaps
nineteen
with
stooped
shoulders
pale
blue
eyes
and
as
amory
could
tell
from
his
general
appearance
without
much
conception
of
social
competition
and
such
phenomena
of
absorbing
interest
still
he
liked
books
and
it
seemed
forever
since
amory
had
met
any
one
who
did
if
only
that
crowd
at
the
next
table
would
not
mistake
for
a
bird
too
he
would
enjoy
the
encounter
tremendously
they
did
seem
to
be
noticing
so
he
let
himself
go
discussed
books
by
the
dozens
books
he
had
read
read
about
books
he
had
never
heard
of
rattling
off
lists
of
titles
with
the
facility
of
a
brentano
clerk
was
partially
taken
in
and
wholly
delighted
in
a
way
he
had
almost
decided
that
princeton
was
one
part
deadly
philistines
and
one
part
deadly
grinds
and
to
find
a
person
who
could
mention
keats
without
stammering
yet
evidently
washed
his
hands
was
rather
a
treat
ever
read
any
oscar
wilde
he
asked
no
who
wrote
it
it
a
man
do
you
know
oh
a
faint
chord
was
struck
in
amory
memory
was
the
comic
opera
written
about
him
yes
that
the
fella
i
just
finished
a
book
of
his
picture
of
dorian
gray
and
i
certainly
wish
you
read
it
you
like
it
you
can
borrow
it
if
you
want
why
i
like
it
a
lot
do
you
want
to
come
up
to
the
room
i
got
a
few
other
amory
hesitated
glanced
at
the
paul
group
one
of
them
was
the
magnificent
exquisite
humbird
and
he
considered
how
determinate
the
addition
of
this
friend
would
be
he
never
got
to
the
stage
of
making
them
and
getting
rid
of
them
he
was
not
hard
enough
for
that
so
he
measured
thomas
parke
undoubted
attractions
and
value
against
the
menace
of
cold
eyes
behind
spectacles
that
he
fancied
glared
from
the
next
table
yes
i
so
he
found
dorian
gray
and
the
mystic
and
somber
dolores
and
the
belle
dame
sans
merci
for
a
month
was
keen
on
naught
else
the
world
became
pale
and
interesting
and
he
tried
hard
to
look
at
princeton
through
the
satiated
eyes
of
oscar
wilde
and
swinburne
or
fingal
and
algernon
charles
as
he
called
them
in
precieuse
jest
he
read
enormously
every
night
shaw
chesterton
barrie
pinero
yeats
synge
ernest
dowson
arthur
symons
keats
sudermann
robert
hugh
benson
the
savoy
operas
just
a
heterogeneous
mixture
for
he
suddenly
discovered
that
he
had
read
nothing
for
years
tom
became
at
first
an
occasion
rather
than
a
friend
amory
saw
him
about
once
a
week
and
together
they
gilded
the
ceiling
of
tom
room
and
decorated
the
walls
with
imitation
tapestry
bought
at
an
auction
tall
candlesticks
and
figured
curtains
amory
liked
him
for
being
clever
and
literary
without
effeminacy
or
affectation
in
fact
amory
did
most
of
the
strutting
and
tried
painfully
to
make
every
remark
an
epigram
than
which
if
one
is
content
with
ostensible
epigrams
there
are
many
feats
harder
univee
was
amused
kerry
read
dorian
gray
and
simulated
lord
henry
following
amory
about
addressing
him
as
dorian
and
pretending
to
encourage
in
him
wicked
fancies
and
attenuated
tendencies
to
ennui
when
he
carried
it
into
commons
to
the
amazement
of
the
others
at
table
amory
became
furiously
embarrassed
and
after
that
made
epigrams
only
before
or
a
convenient
mirror
one
day
tom
and
amory
tried
reciting
their
own
and
lord
dunsany
poems
to
the
music
of
kerry
graphophone
chant
cried
tom
do
recite
chant
amory
who
was
performing
looked
annoyed
and
claimed
that
he
needed
a
record
with
less
piano
in
it
kerry
thereupon
rolled
on
the
floor
in
stifled
laughter
put
on
and
flowers
he
howled
oh
my
lord
i
going
to
cast
a
shut
off
the
damn
graphophone
amory
cried
rather
red
in
the
face
i
not
giving
an
in
the
meanwhile
amory
delicately
kept
trying
to
awaken
a
sense
of
the
social
system
in
for
he
knew
that
this
poet
was
really
more
conventional
than
he
and
needed
merely
watered
hair
a
smaller
range
of
conversation
and
a
darker
brown
hat
to
become
quite
regular
but
the
liturgy
of
livingstone
collars
and
dark
ties
fell
on
heedless
ears
in
fact
faintly
resented
his
efforts
so
amory
confined
himself
to
calls
once
a
week
and
brought
him
occasionally
to
univee
this
caused
mild
titters
among
the
other
freshmen
who
called
them
doctor
johnson
and
alec
connage
another
frequent
visitor
liked
him
in
a
vague
way
but
was
afraid
of
him
as
a
highbrow
kerry
who
saw
through
his
poetic
patter
to
the
solid
almost
respectable
depths
within
was
immensely
amused
and
would
have
him
recite
poetry
by
the
hour
while
he
lay
with
closed
eyes
on
amory
sofa
and
listened
asleep
or
waking
is
it
for
her
neck
kissed
over
close
wears
yet
a
purple
speck
wherein
the
pained
blood
falters
and
goes
out
soft
and
stung
softly
fairer
for
a
fleck
that
good
kerry
would
say
softly
it
pleases
the
elder
holiday
that
a
great
poet
i
tom
delighted
at
an
audience
would
ramble
through
the
poems
and
ballades
until
kerry
and
amory
knew
them
almost
as
well
as
he
amory
took
to
writing
poetry
on
spring
afternoons
in
the
gardens
of
the
big
estates
near
princeton
while
swans
made
effective
atmosphere
in
the
artificial
pools
and
slow
clouds
sailed
harmoniously
above
the
willows
may
came
too
soon
and
suddenly
unable
to
bear
walls
he
wandered
the
campus
at
all
hours
through
starlight
and
rain
a
damp
symbolic
interlude
the
night
mist
fell
from
the
moon
it
rolled
clustered
about
the
spires
and
towers
and
then
settled
below
them
so
that
the
dreaming
peaks
were
still
in
lofty
aspiration
toward
the
sky
figures
that
dotted
the
day
like
ants
now
brushed
along
as
shadowy
ghosts
in
and
out
of
the
foreground
the
gothic
halls
and
cloisters
were
infinitely
more
mysterious
as
they
loomed
suddenly
out
of
the
darkness
outlined
each
by
myriad
faint
squares
of
yellow
light
indefinitely
from
somewhere
a
bell
boomed
the
and
amory
pausing
by
the
stretched
himself
out
full
length
on
the
damp
grass
the
cool
bathed
his
eyes
and
slowed
the
flight
of
time
time
that
had
crept
so
insidiously
through
the
lazy
april
afternoons
seemed
so
intangible
in
the
long
spring
twilights
evening
after
evening
the
senior
singing
had
drifted
over
the
campus
in
melancholy
beauty
and
through
the
shell
of
his
undergraduate
consciousness
had
broken
a
deep
and
reverent
devotion
to
the
gray
walls
and
gothic
peaks
and
all
they
symbolized
as
warehouses
of
dead
ages
the
tower
that
in
view
of
his
window
sprang
upward
grew
into
a
spire
yearning
higher
until
its
uppermost
tip
was
half
invisible
against
the
morning
skies
gave
him
the
first
sense
of
the
transiency
and
unimportance
of
the
campus
figures
except
as
holders
of
the
apostolic
succession
he
liked
knowing
that
gothic
architecture
with
its
upward
trend
was
peculiarly
appropriate
to
universities
and
the
idea
became
personal
to
him
the
silent
stretches
of
green
the
quiet
halls
with
an
occasional
scholastic
light
held
his
imagination
in
a
strong
grasp
and
the
chastity
of
the
spire
became
a
symbol
of
this
perception
damn
it
all
he
whispered
aloud
wetting
his
hands
in
the
damp
and
running
them
through
his
hair
next
year
i
work
yet
he
knew
that
where
now
the
spirit
of
spires
and
towers
made
him
dreamily
acquiescent
it
would
then
overawe
him
where
now
he
realized
only
his
own
inconsequence
effort
would
make
him
aware
of
his
own
impotency
and
insufficiency
the
college
dreamed
on
awake
he
felt
a
nervous
excitement
that
might
have
been
the
very
throb
of
its
slow
heart
it
was
a
stream
where
he
was
to
throw
a
stone
whose
faint
ripple
would
be
vanishing
almost
as
it
left
his
hand
as
yet
he
had
given
nothing
he
had
taken
nothing
a
belated
freshman
his
oilskin
slicker
rasping
loudly
slushed
along
the
soft
path
a
voice
from
somewhere
called
the
inevitable
formula
stick
out
your
head
below
an
unseen
window
a
hundred
little
sounds
of
the
current
drifting
on
under
the
fog
pressed
in
finally
on
his
consciousness
oh
god
he
cried
suddenly
and
started
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
in
the
stillness
the
rain
dripped
on
a
minute
longer
he
lay
without
moving
his
hands
clinched
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
gave
his
clothes
a
tentative
pat
i
very
damn
wet
he
said
aloud
to
the
historical
the
war
began
in
the
summer
following
his
freshman
year
beyond
a
sporting
interest
in
the
german
dash
for
paris
the
whole
affair
failed
either
to
thrill
or
interest
him
with
the
attitude
he
might
have
held
toward
an
amusing
melodrama
he
hoped
it
would
be
long
and
bloody
if
it
had
not
continued
he
would
have
felt
like
an
irate
at
a
where
the
principals
refused
to
mix
it
up
that
was
his
total
reaction
hortense
all
right
ponies
shake
it
up
hey
ponies
how
about
easing
up
on
that
crap
game
and
shaking
a
mean
hip
hey
the
coach
fumed
helplessly
the
triangle
club
president
glowering
with
anxiety
varied
between
furious
bursts
of
authority
and
fits
of
temperamental
lassitude
when
he
sat
spiritless
and
wondered
how
the
devil
the
show
was
ever
going
on
tour
by
christmas
all
right
we
take
the
pirate
the
ponies
took
last
drags
at
their
cigarettes
and
slumped
into
place
the
leading
lady
rushed
into
the
foreground
setting
his
hands
and
feet
in
an
atmospheric
mince
and
as
the
coach
clapped
and
stamped
and
tumped
and
they
hashed
out
a
dance
a
great
seething
was
the
triangle
club
it
gave
a
musical
comedy
every
year
travelling
with
cast
chorus
orchestra
and
scenery
all
through
christmas
vacation
the
play
and
music
were
the
work
of
undergraduates
and
the
club
itself
was
the
most
influential
of
institutions
over
three
hundred
men
competing
for
it
every
year
amory
after
an
easy
victory
in
the
first
sophomore
princetonian
competition
stepped
into
a
vacancy
of
the
cast
as
boiling
oil
a
pirate
lieutenant
every
night
for
the
last
week
they
had
rehearsed
hortense
in
the
casino
from
two
in
the
afternoon
until
eight
in
the
morning
sustained
by
dark
and
powerful
coffee
and
sleeping
in
lectures
through
the
interim
a
rare
scene
the
casino
a
big
barnlike
auditorium
dotted
with
boys
as
girls
boys
as
pirates
boys
as
babies
the
scenery
in
course
of
being
violently
set
up
the
spotlight
man
rehearsing
by
throwing
weird
shafts
into
angry
eyes
over
all
the
constant
tuning
of
the
orchestra
or
the
cheerful
of
a
triangle
tune
the
boy
who
writes
the
lyrics
stands
in
the
corner
biting
a
pencil
with
twenty
minutes
to
think
of
an
encore
the
business
manager
argues
with
the
secretary
as
to
how
much
money
can
be
spent
on
those
damn
milkmaid
costumes
the
old
graduate
president
in
perches
on
a
box
and
thinks
how
much
simpler
it
was
in
his
day
how
a
triangle
show
ever
got
off
was
a
mystery
but
it
was
a
riotous
mystery
anyway
whether
or
not
one
did
enough
service
to
wear
a
little
gold
triangle
on
his
hortense
was
written
over
six
times
and
had
the
names
of
nine
collaborators
on
the
programme
all
triangle
shows
started
by
being
something
different
not
just
a
regular
musical
comedy
but
when
the
several
authors
the
president
the
coach
and
the
faculty
committee
finished
with
it
there
remained
just
the
old
reliable
triangle
show
with
the
old
reliable
jokes
and
the
star
comedian
who
got
expelled
or
sick
or
something
just
before
the
trip
and
the
man
in
the
who
absolutely
wo
shave
twice
a
day
doggone
it
there
was
one
brilliant
place
in
hortense
it
is
a
princeton
tradition
that
whenever
a
yale
man
who
is
a
member
of
the
widely
advertised
skull
and
bones
hears
the
sacred
name
mentioned
he
must
leave
the
room
it
is
also
a
tradition
that
the
members
are
invariably
successful
in
later
life
amassing
fortunes
or
votes
or
coupons
or
whatever
they
choose
to
amass
therefore
at
each
performance
of
hortense
seats
were
kept
from
sale
and
occupied
by
six
of
the
vagabonds
that
could
be
hired
from
the
streets
further
touched
up
by
the
triangle
man
at
the
moment
in
the
show
where
firebrand
the
pirate
chief
pointed
at
his
black
flag
and
said
i
am
a
yale
graduate
note
my
skull
and
bones
at
this
very
moment
the
six
vagabonds
were
instructed
to
rise
and
leave
the
theatre
with
looks
of
deep
melancholy
and
an
injured
dignity
it
was
claimed
though
never
proved
that
on
one
occasion
the
hired
elis
were
swelled
by
one
of
the
real
thing
they
played
through
vacation
to
the
fashionable
of
eight
cities
amory
liked
louisville
and
memphis
best
these
knew
how
to
meet
strangers
furnished
extraordinary
punch
and
flaunted
an
astonishing
array
of
feminine
beauty
chicago
he
approved
for
a
certain
verve
that
transcended
its
loud
accent
however
it
was
a
yale
town
and
as
the
yale
glee
club
was
expected
in
a
week
the
triangle
received
only
divided
homage
in
baltimore
princeton
was
at
home
and
every
one
fell
in
love
there
was
a
proper
consumption
of
strong
waters
all
along
the
line
one
man
invariably
went
on
the
stage
highly
stimulated
claiming
that
his
particular
interpretation
of
the
part
required
it
there
were
three
private
cars
however
no
one
slept
except
in
the
third
car
which
was
called
the
animal
car
and
where
were
herded
the
spectacled
of
the
orchestra
everything
was
so
hurried
that
there
was
no
time
to
be
bored
but
when
they
arrived
in
philadelphia
with
vacation
nearly
over
there
was
rest
in
getting
out
of
the
heavy
atmosphere
of
flowers
and
and
the
ponies
took
off
their
corsets
with
abdominal
pains
and
sighs
of
relief
when
the
disbanding
came
amory
set
out
post
haste
for
minneapolis
for
sally
weatherby
cousin
isabelle
borge
was
coming
to
spend
the
winter
in
minneapolis
while
her
parents
went
abroad
he
remembered
isabelle
only
as
a
little
girl
with
whom
he
had
played
sometimes
when
he
first
went
to
minneapolis
she
had
gone
to
baltimore
to
live
but
since
then
she
had
developed
a
past
amory
was
in
full
stride
confident
nervous
and
jubilant
scurrying
back
to
minneapolis
to
see
a
girl
he
had
known
as
a
child
seemed
the
interesting
and
romantic
thing
to
do
so
without
compunction
he
wired
his
mother
not
to
expect
him
sat
in
the
train
and
thought
about
himself
for
hours
petting
on
the
triangle
trip
amory
had
come
into
constant
contact
with
that
great
current
american
phenomenon
the
petting
none
of
the
victorian
mothers
and
most
of
the
mothers
were
victorian
had
any
idea
how
casually
their
daughters
were
accustomed
to
be
kissed
are
that
way
says
to
her
popular
daughter
they
are
kissed
first
and
proposed
to
but
the
popular
daughter
becomes
engaged
every
six
months
between
sixteen
and
when
she
arranges
a
match
with
young
hambell
of
cambell
hambell
who
fatuously
considers
himself
her
first
love
and
between
engagements
the
she
is
selected
by
the
system
at
dances
which
favors
the
survival
of
the
fittest
has
other
sentimental
last
kisses
in
the
moonlight
or
the
firelight
or
the
outer
darkness
amory
saw
girls
doing
things
that
even
in
his
memory
would
have
been
impossible
eating
suppers
in
impossible
cafes
talking
of
every
side
of
life
with
an
air
half
of
earnestness
half
of
mockery
yet
with
a
furtive
excitement
that
amory
considered
stood
for
a
real
moral
but
he
never
realized
how
it
was
until
he
saw
the
cities
between
new
york
and
chicago
as
one
vast
juvenile
intrigue
afternoon
at
the
plaza
with
winter
twilight
hovering
outside
and
faint
drums
they
strut
and
fret
in
the
lobby
taking
another
cocktail
scrupulously
attired
and
waiting
then
the
swinging
doors
revolve
and
three
bundles
of
fur
mince
in
the
theatre
comes
afterward
then
a
table
at
the
midnight
frolic
of
course
mother
will
be
along
there
but
she
will
serve
only
to
make
things
more
secretive
and
brilliant
as
she
sits
in
solitary
state
at
the
deserted
table
and
thinks
such
entertainments
as
this
are
not
half
so
bad
as
they
are
painted
only
rather
wearying
but
the
is
in
love
again
it
was
odd
was
it
that
though
there
was
so
much
room
left
in
the
taxi
the
and
the
boy
from
williams
were
somehow
crowded
out
and
had
to
go
in
a
separate
car
odd
did
you
notice
how
flushed
the
was
when
she
arrived
just
seven
minutes
late
but
the
gets
away
with
the
belle
had
become
the
flirt
the
flirt
had
become
the
baby
the
belle
had
five
or
six
callers
every
afternoon
if
the
by
some
strange
accident
has
two
it
is
made
pretty
uncomfortable
for
the
one
who
has
a
date
with
her
the
belle
was
surrounded
by
a
dozen
men
in
the
intermissions
between
dances
try
to
find
the
between
dances
just
to
find
her
the
same
girl
deep
in
an
atmosphere
of
jungle
music
and
the
questioning
of
moral
codes
amory
found
it
rather
fascinating
to
feel
that
any
popular
girl
he
met
before
eight
he
might
quite
possibly
kiss
before
twelve
why
on
earth
are
we
here
he
asked
the
girl
with
the
green
combs
one
night
as
they
sat
in
some
one
limousine
outside
the
country
club
in
louisville
i
do
know
i
just
full
of
the
let
be
frank
we
never
see
each
other
again
i
wanted
to
come
out
here
with
you
because
i
thought
you
were
the
girl
in
sight
you
really
do
care
whether
you
ever
see
me
again
do
you
no
but
is
this
your
line
for
every
girl
what
have
i
done
to
deserve
it
and
you
did
feel
tired
dancing
or
want
a
cigarette
or
any
of
the
things
you
said
you
just
wanted
to
be
oh
let
go
in
she
interrupted
if
you
want
to
let
not
about
when
the
sleeveless
jerseys
were
stylish
amory
in
a
burst
of
inspiration
named
them
petting
the
name
travelled
from
coast
to
coast
on
the
lips
of
and
descriptive
amory
was
now
eighteen
years
old
just
under
six
feet
tall
and
exceptionally
but
not
conventionally
handsome
he
had
rather
a
young
face
the
ingenuousness
of
which
was
marred
by
the
penetrating
green
eyes
fringed
with
long
dark
eyelashes
he
lacked
somehow
that
intense
animal
magnetism
that
so
often
accompanies
beauty
in
men
or
women
his
personality
seemed
rather
a
mental
thing
and
it
was
not
in
his
power
to
turn
it
on
and
off
like
a
but
people
never
forgot
his
face
isabelle
she
paused
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
the
sensations
attributed
to
divers
on
leading
ladies
on
opening
nights
and
lumpy
husky
young
men
on
the
day
of
the
big
game
crowded
through
her
she
should
have
descended
to
a
burst
of
drums
or
a
discordant
blend
of
themes
from
thais
and
she
had
never
been
so
curious
about
her
appearance
she
had
never
been
so
satisfied
with
it
she
had
been
sixteen
years
old
for
six
months
isabelle
called
her
cousin
sally
from
the
doorway
of
the
i
she
caught
a
slight
lump
of
nervousness
in
her
throat
i
had
to
send
back
to
the
house
for
another
pair
of
slippers
it
be
just
a
isabelle
started
toward
the
for
a
last
peek
in
the
mirror
but
something
decided
her
to
stand
there
and
gaze
down
the
broad
stairs
of
the
minnehaha
club
they
curved
tantalizingly
and
she
could
catch
just
a
glimpse
of
two
pairs
of
masculine
feet
in
the
hall
below
in
uniform
black
they
gave
no
hint
of
identity
but
she
wondered
eagerly
if
one
pair
were
attached
to
amory
blaine
this
young
man
not
as
yet
encountered
had
nevertheless
taken
up
a
considerable
part
of
her
day
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
coming
up
in
the
machine
from
the
station
sally
had
volunteered
amid
a
rain
of
question
comment
revelation
and
exaggeration
you
remember
amory
blaine
of
well
he
simply
mad
to
see
you
again
he
stayed
over
a
day
from
college
and
he
coming
he
heard
so
much
about
you
says
he
remembers
your
this
had
pleased
isabelle
it
put
them
on
equal
terms
although
she
was
quite
capable
of
staging
her
own
romances
with
or
without
advance
advertising
but
following
her
happy
tremble
of
anticipation
came
a
sinking
sensation
that
made
her
ask
how
do
you
mean
he
heard
about
me
what
sort
of
things
sally
smiled
she
felt
rather
in
the
capacity
of
a
showman
with
her
more
exotic
cousin
he
knows
you
you
considered
beautiful
and
all
that
she
paused
and
i
guess
he
knows
you
been
at
this
isabelle
little
fist
had
clinched
suddenly
under
the
fur
robe
she
was
accustomed
to
be
thus
followed
by
her
desperate
past
and
it
never
failed
to
rouse
in
her
the
same
feeling
of
resentment
yet
in
a
strange
town
it
was
an
advantageous
reputation
she
was
a
speed
was
she
well
let
them
find
out
out
of
the
window
isabelle
watched
the
snow
glide
by
in
the
frosty
morning
it
was
ever
so
much
colder
here
than
in
baltimore
she
had
not
remembered
the
glass
of
the
side
door
was
iced
the
windows
were
shirred
with
snow
in
the
corners
her
mind
played
still
with
one
subject
did
dress
like
that
boy
there
who
walked
calmly
down
a
bustling
business
street
in
moccasins
and
costume
how
very
of
course
he
was
that
way
he
went
to
princeton
was
a
sophomore
or
something
really
she
had
no
distinct
idea
of
him
an
ancient
she
had
preserved
in
an
old
kodak
book
had
impressed
her
by
the
big
eyes
which
he
had
probably
grown
up
to
by
now
however
in
the
last
month
when
her
winter
visit
to
sally
had
been
decided
on
he
had
assumed
the
proportions
of
a
worthy
adversary
children
most
astute
of
plot
their
campaigns
quickly
and
sally
had
played
a
clever
correspondence
sonata
to
isabelle
excitable
temperament
isabelle
had
been
for
some
time
capable
of
very
strong
if
very
transient
emotions
they
drew
up
at
a
spreading
building
set
back
from
the
snowy
street
weatherby
greeted
her
warmly
and
her
various
younger
cousins
were
produced
from
the
corners
where
they
skulked
politely
isabelle
met
them
tactfully
at
her
best
she
allied
all
with
whom
she
came
in
contact
except
older
girls
and
some
women
all
the
impressions
she
made
were
conscious
the
girls
she
renewed
acquaintance
with
that
morning
were
all
rather
impressed
and
as
much
by
her
direct
personality
as
by
her
reputation
amory
blaine
was
an
open
subject
evidently
a
bit
light
of
love
neither
popular
nor
unpopular
every
girl
there
seemed
to
have
had
an
affair
with
him
at
some
time
or
other
but
no
one
volunteered
any
really
useful
information
he
was
going
to
fall
for
her
sally
had
published
that
information
to
her
young
set
and
they
were
retailing
it
back
to
sally
as
fast
as
they
set
eyes
on
isabelle
isabelle
resolved
secretly
that
she
would
if
necessary
herself
to
like
him
she
owed
it
to
sally
suppose
she
were
terribly
disappointed
sally
had
painted
him
in
such
glowing
colors
he
was
sort
of
distinguished
when
he
wants
to
be
had
a
line
and
was
properly
inconstant
in
fact
he
summed
up
all
the
romance
that
her
age
and
environment
led
her
to
desire
she
wondered
if
those
were
his
that
tentatively
around
the
soft
rug
below
all
impressions
and
in
fact
all
ideas
were
extremely
kaleidoscopic
to
isabelle
she
had
that
curious
mixture
of
the
social
and
the
artistic
temperaments
found
often
in
two
classes
society
women
and
actresses
her
education
or
rather
her
sophistication
had
been
absorbed
from
the
boys
who
had
dangled
on
her
favor
her
tact
was
instinctive
and
her
capacity
for
was
limited
only
by
the
number
of
the
susceptible
within
telephone
distance
flirt
smiled
from
her
large
eyes
and
shone
through
her
intense
physical
magnetism
so
she
waited
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
that
evening
while
slippers
were
fetched
just
as
she
was
growing
impatient
sally
came
out
of
the
beaming
with
her
accustomed
good
nature
and
high
spirits
and
together
they
descended
to
the
floor
below
while
the
shifting
of
isabelle
mind
flashed
on
two
ideas
she
was
glad
she
had
high
color
and
she
wondered
if
he
danced
well
in
the
club
great
room
she
was
surrounded
for
a
moment
by
the
girls
she
had
met
in
the
afternoon
then
she
heard
sally
voice
repeating
a
cycle
of
names
and
found
herself
bowing
to
a
sextet
of
black
and
white
terribly
stiff
vaguely
familiar
figures
the
name
blaine
figured
somewhere
but
at
first
she
could
not
place
him
a
very
confused
very
juvenile
moment
of
awkward
backings
and
bumpings
followed
and
every
one
found
himself
talking
to
the
person
he
least
desired
to
isabelle
manoeuvred
herself
and
froggy
parker
freshman
at
harvard
with
whom
she
had
once
played
to
a
seat
on
the
stairs
a
humorous
reference
to
the
past
was
all
she
needed
the
things
isabelle
could
do
socially
with
one
idea
were
remarkable
first
she
repeated
it
rapturously
in
an
enthusiastic
contralto
with
a
soupcon
of
southern
accent
then
she
held
it
off
at
a
distance
and
smiled
at
it
her
wonderful
smile
then
she
delivered
it
in
variations
and
played
a
sort
of
mental
catch
with
it
all
this
in
the
nominal
form
of
dialogue
froggy
was
fascinated
and
quite
unconscious
that
this
was
being
done
not
for
him
but
for
the
green
eyes
that
glistened
under
the
shining
carefully
watered
hair
a
little
to
her
left
for
isabelle
had
discovered
amory
as
an
actress
even
in
the
fullest
flush
of
her
own
conscious
magnetism
gets
a
deep
impression
of
most
of
the
people
in
the
front
row
so
isabelle
sized
up
her
antagonist
first
he
had
auburn
hair
and
from
her
feeling
of
disappointment
she
knew
that
she
had
expected
him
to
be
dark
and
of
slenderness
for
the
rest
a
faint
flush
and
a
straight
romantic
profile
the
effect
set
off
by
a
dress
suit
and
a
silk
ruffled
shirt
of
the
kind
that
women
still
delight
to
see
men
wear
but
men
were
just
beginning
to
get
tired
of
during
this
inspection
amory
was
quietly
watching
do
think
so
she
said
suddenly
turning
to
him
there
was
a
stir
and
sally
led
the
way
over
to
their
table
amory
struggled
to
isabelle
side
and
whispered
you
my
dinner
partner
you
know
we
all
coached
for
each
isabelle
gasped
this
was
rather
right
in
line
but
really
she
felt
as
if
a
good
speech
had
been
taken
from
the
star
and
given
to
a
minor
character
she
must
lose
the
leadership
a
bit
the
glittered
with
laughter
at
the
confusion
of
getting
places
and
then
curious
eyes
were
turned
on
her
sitting
near
the
head
she
was
enjoying
this
immensely
and
froggy
parker
was
so
engrossed
with
the
added
sparkle
of
her
rising
color
that
he
forgot
to
pull
out
sally
chair
and
fell
into
a
dim
confusion
amory
was
on
the
other
side
full
of
confidence
and
vanity
gazing
at
her
in
open
admiration
he
began
directly
and
so
did
froggy
i
heard
a
lot
about
you
since
you
wore
braids
was
it
funny
this
afternoon
both
stopped
isabelle
turned
to
amory
shyly
her
face
was
always
enough
answer
for
any
one
but
she
decided
to
speak
how
from
whom
from
everybody
for
all
the
years
since
you
been
she
blushed
appropriately
on
her
right
froggy
was
de
already
although
he
had
quite
realized
it
i
tell
you
what
i
remembered
about
you
all
these
years
amory
continued
she
leaned
slightly
toward
him
and
looked
modestly
at
the
celery
before
her
froggy
sighed
he
knew
amory
and
the
situations
that
amory
seemed
born
to
handle
he
turned
to
sally
and
asked
her
if
she
was
going
away
to
school
next
year
amory
opened
with
i
got
an
adjective
that
just
fits
this
was
one
of
his
favorite
starts
he
seldom
had
a
word
in
mind
but
it
was
a
curiosity
provoker
and
he
could
always
produce
something
complimentary
if
he
got
in
a
tight
corner
oh
what
isabelle
face
was
a
study
in
enraptured
curiosity
amory
shook
his
head
i
do
know
you
very
well
will
you
tell
me
afterward
she
half
whispered
he
nodded
we
sit
isabelle
nodded
did
any
one
ever
tell
you
you
have
keen
eyes
she
said
amory
attempted
to
make
them
look
even
keener
he
fancied
but
he
was
not
sure
that
her
foot
had
just
touched
his
under
the
table
but
it
might
possibly
have
been
only
the
table
leg
it
was
so
hard
to
tell
still
it
thrilled
him
he
wondered
quickly
if
there
would
be
any
difficulty
in
securing
the
little
den
babes
in
the
woods
isabelle
and
amory
were
distinctly
not
innocent
nor
were
they
particularly
brazen
moreover
amateur
standing
had
very
little
value
in
the
game
they
were
playing
a
game
that
would
presumably
be
her
principal
study
for
years
to
come
she
had
begun
as
he
had
with
good
looks
and
an
excitable
temperament
and
the
rest
was
the
result
of
accessible
popular
novels
and
conversation
culled
from
a
slightly
older
set
isabelle
had
walked
with
an
artificial
gait
at
nine
and
a
half
and
when
her
eyes
wide
and
starry
proclaimed
the
ingenue
most
amory
was
proportionately
less
deceived
he
waited
for
the
mask
to
drop
off
but
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
question
her
right
to
wear
it
she
on
her
part
was
not
impressed
by
his
studied
air
of
blasé
sophistication
she
had
lived
in
a
larger
city
and
had
slightly
an
advantage
in
range
but
she
accepted
his
pose
it
was
one
of
the
dozen
little
conventions
of
this
kind
of
affair
he
was
aware
that
he
was
getting
this
particular
favor
now
because
she
had
been
coached
he
knew
that
he
stood
for
merely
the
best
game
in
sight
and
that
he
would
have
to
improve
his
opportunity
before
he
lost
his
advantage
so
they
proceeded
with
an
infinite
guile
that
would
have
horrified
her
parents
after
the
dinner
the
dance
began
smoothly
smoothly
boys
cut
in
on
isabelle
every
few
feet
and
then
squabbled
in
the
corners
with
you
might
let
me
get
more
than
an
inch
and
she
did
like
it
either
she
told
me
so
next
time
i
cut
it
was
true
she
told
every
one
so
and
gave
every
hand
a
parting
pressure
that
said
you
know
that
your
dances
are
my
but
time
passed
two
hours
of
it
and
the
less
subtle
beaux
had
better
learned
to
focus
their
glances
elsewhere
for
eleven
found
isabelle
and
amory
sitting
on
the
couch
in
the
little
den
off
the
she
was
conscious
that
they
were
a
handsome
pair
and
seemed
to
belong
distinctively
in
this
seclusion
while
lesser
lights
fluttered
and
chattered
boys
who
passed
the
door
looked
in
enviously
girls
who
passed
only
laughed
and
frowned
and
grew
wise
within
themselves
they
had
now
reached
a
very
definite
stage
they
had
traded
accounts
of
their
progress
since
they
had
met
last
and
she
had
listened
to
much
she
had
heard
before
he
was
a
sophomore
was
on
the
princetonian
board
hoped
to
be
chairman
in
senior
year
he
learned
that
some
of
the
boys
she
went
with
in
baltimore
were
terrible
speeds
and
came
to
dances
in
states
of
artificial
stimulation
most
of
them
were
twenty
or
so
and
drove
alluring
red
stutzes
a
good
half
seemed
to
have
already
flunked
out
of
various
schools
and
colleges
but
some
of
them
bore
athletic
names
that
made
him
look
at
her
admiringly
as
a
matter
of
fact
isabelle
closer
acquaintance
with
the
universities
was
just
commencing
she
had
bowing
acquaintance
with
a
lot
of
young
men
who
thought
she
was
a
pretty
kid
worth
keeping
an
eye
but
isabelle
strung
the
names
into
a
fabrication
of
gayety
that
would
have
dazzled
a
viennese
nobleman
such
is
the
power
of
young
contralto
voices
on
sofas
he
asked
her
if
she
thought
he
was
conceited
she
said
there
was
a
difference
between
conceit
and
she
adored
in
men
is
froggy
a
good
friend
of
yours
she
asked
rather
why
he
a
bum
amory
laughed
he
dances
as
if
the
girl
were
on
his
back
instead
of
in
his
she
appreciated
this
you
awfully
good
at
sizing
people
amory
denied
this
painfully
however
he
sized
up
several
people
for
her
then
they
talked
about
hands
you
got
awfully
nice
hands
she
said
they
look
as
if
you
played
the
piano
do
you
i
have
said
they
had
reached
a
very
definite
stage
nay
more
a
very
critical
stage
amory
had
stayed
over
a
day
to
see
her
and
his
train
left
at
that
night
his
trunk
and
suitcase
awaited
him
at
the
station
his
watch
was
beginning
to
hang
heavy
in
his
pocket
isabelle
he
said
suddenly
i
want
to
tell
you
they
had
been
talking
lightly
about
that
funny
look
in
her
eyes
and
isabelle
knew
from
the
change
in
his
manner
what
was
coming
indeed
she
had
been
wondering
how
soon
it
would
come
amory
reached
above
their
heads
and
turned
out
the
electric
light
so
that
they
were
in
the
dark
except
for
the
red
glow
that
fell
through
the
door
from
the
lamps
then
he
began
i
do
know
whether
or
not
you
know
what
you
what
i
going
to
say
lordy
isabelle
this
like
a
line
but
it
i
know
said
isabelle
softly
maybe
we
never
meet
again
like
this
i
have
darned
hard
luck
he
was
leaning
away
from
her
on
the
other
arm
of
the
lounge
but
she
could
see
his
eyes
plainly
in
the
dark
you
meet
me
again
there
was
just
the
slightest
emphasis
on
the
last
word
so
that
it
became
almost
a
term
of
endearment
he
continued
a
bit
huskily
i
fallen
for
a
lot
of
people
girls
and
i
guess
you
have
too
boys
i
mean
but
honestly
you
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
leaned
forward
chin
on
his
hands
oh
what
the
use
you
go
your
way
and
i
suppose
i
go
silence
for
a
moment
isabelle
was
quite
stirred
she
wound
her
handkerchief
into
a
tight
ball
and
by
the
faint
light
that
streamed
over
her
dropped
it
deliberately
on
the
floor
their
hands
touched
for
an
instant
but
neither
spoke
silences
were
becoming
more
frequent
and
more
delicious
outside
another
stray
couple
had
come
up
and
were
experimenting
on
the
piano
in
the
next
room
after
the
usual
preliminary
of
chopsticks
one
of
them
started
babes
in
the
woods
and
a
light
tenor
carried
the
words
into
the
den
give
me
your
hand
i
understand
we
off
to
isabelle
hummed
it
softly
and
trembled
as
she
felt
amory
hand
close
over
hers
isabelle
he
whispered
you
know
i
mad
about
you
you
give
a
darn
about
how
much
do
you
care
do
you
like
any
one
better
he
could
scarcely
hear
her
although
he
bent
so
near
that
he
felt
her
breath
against
his
cheek
isabelle
i
going
back
to
college
for
six
long
months
and
why
should
we
if
i
could
only
just
have
one
thing
to
remember
you
by
close
the
door
her
voice
had
just
stirred
so
that
he
half
wondered
whether
she
had
spoken
at
all
as
he
swung
the
door
softly
shut
the
music
seemed
quivering
just
outside
moonlight
is
bright
kiss
me
good
what
a
wonderful
song
she
thought
everything
was
wonderful
most
of
all
this
romantic
scene
in
the
den
with
their
hands
clinging
and
the
inevitable
looming
charmingly
close
the
future
vista
of
her
life
seemed
an
unending
succession
of
scenes
like
this
under
moonlight
and
pale
starlight
and
in
the
backs
of
warm
limousines
and
in
low
cosy
roadsters
stopped
under
sheltering
trees
only
the
boy
might
change
and
this
one
was
so
nice
he
took
her
hand
softly
with
a
sudden
movement
he
turned
it
and
holding
it
to
his
lips
kissed
the
palm
isabelle
his
whisper
blended
in
the
music
and
they
seemed
to
float
nearer
together
her
breath
came
faster
ca
i
kiss
you
isabelle
isabelle
lips
half
parted
she
turned
her
head
to
him
in
the
dark
suddenly
the
ring
of
voices
the
sound
of
running
footsteps
surged
toward
them
quick
as
a
flash
amory
reached
up
and
turned
on
the
light
and
when
the
door
opened
and
three
boys
the
wrathy
and
froggy
among
them
rushed
in
he
was
turning
over
the
magazines
on
the
table
while
she
sat
without
moving
serene
and
unembarrassed
and
even
greeted
them
with
a
welcoming
smile
but
her
heart
was
beating
wildly
and
she
felt
somehow
as
if
she
had
been
deprived
it
was
evidently
over
there
was
a
clamor
for
a
dance
there
was
a
glance
that
passed
between
them
on
his
side
despair
on
hers
regret
and
then
the
evening
went
on
with
the
reassured
beaux
and
the
eternal
cutting
in
at
quarter
to
twelve
amory
shook
hands
with
her
gravely
in
the
midst
of
a
small
crowd
assembled
to
wish
him
for
an
instant
he
lost
his
poise
and
she
felt
a
bit
rattled
when
a
satirical
voice
from
a
concealed
wit
cried
take
her
outside
amory
as
he
took
her
hand
he
pressed
it
a
little
and
she
returned
the
pressure
as
she
had
done
to
twenty
hands
that
evening
that
was
all
at
two
back
at
the
weatherbys
sally
asked
her
if
she
and
amory
had
had
a
time
in
the
den
isabelle
turned
to
her
quietly
in
her
eyes
was
the
light
of
the
idealist
the
inviolate
dreamer
of
dreams
no
she
answered
i
do
do
that
sort
of
thing
any
more
he
asked
me
to
but
i
said
as
she
crept
in
bed
she
wondered
what
he
say
in
his
special
delivery
he
had
such
a
mouth
would
she
ever
fourteen
angels
were
watching
them
sang
sally
sleepily
from
the
next
room
damn
muttered
isabelle
punching
the
pillow
into
a
luxurious
lump
and
exploring
the
cold
sheets
cautiously
damn
carnival
amory
by
way
of
the
princetonian
had
arrived
the
minor
snobs
finely
balanced
thermometers
of
success
warmed
to
him
as
the
club
elections
grew
nigh
and
he
and
tom
were
visited
by
groups
of
upper
classmen
who
arrived
awkwardly
balanced
on
the
edge
of
the
furniture
and
talked
of
all
subjects
except
the
one
of
absorbing
interest
amory
was
amused
at
the
intent
eyes
upon
him
and
in
case
the
visitors
represented
some
club
in
which
he
was
not
interested
took
great
pleasure
in
shocking
them
with
unorthodox
remarks
oh
let
me
see
he
said
one
night
to
a
flabbergasted
delegation
what
club
do
you
represent
with
visitors
from
ivy
and
cottage
and
tiger
inn
he
played
the
nice
unspoilt
ingenuous
boy
very
much
at
ease
and
quite
unaware
of
the
object
of
the
call
when
the
fatal
morning
arrived
early
in
march
and
the
campus
became
a
document
in
hysteria
he
slid
smoothly
into
cottage
with
alec
connage
and
watched
his
suddenly
neurotic
class
with
much
wonder
there
were
fickle
groups
that
jumped
from
club
to
club
there
were
friends
of
two
or
three
days
who
announced
tearfully
and
wildly
that
they
must
join
the
same
club
nothing
should
separate
them
there
were
snarling
disclosures
of
grudges
as
the
suddenly
prominent
remembered
snubs
of
freshman
year
unknown
men
were
elevated
into
importance
when
they
received
certain
coveted
bids
others
who
were
considered
all
set
found
that
they
had
made
unexpected
enemies
felt
themselves
stranded
and
deserted
talked
wildly
of
leaving
college
in
his
own
crowd
amory
saw
men
kept
out
for
wearing
green
hats
for
being
a
damn
tailor
dummy
for
having
too
much
pull
in
heaven
for
getting
drunk
one
night
not
like
a
gentleman
by
god
or
for
unfathomable
secret
reasons
known
to
no
one
but
the
wielders
of
the
black
balls
this
orgy
of
sociability
culminated
in
a
gigantic
party
at
the
nassau
inn
where
punch
was
dispensed
from
immense
bowls
and
the
whole
became
a
delirious
circulating
shouting
pattern
of
faces
and
voices
hi
dibby
goo
boy
tom
you
got
a
good
bunch
in
say
kerry
oh
kerry
i
hear

when

on
a
bicycle
afraid
it
was
a
how
you
get
into
cap
you
old
roue
yourself
hear
you
got
a
good
when
the
bar
closed
the
party
broke
up
into
groups
and
streamed
singing
over
the
campus
in
a
weird
delusion
that
snobbishness
and
strain
were
over
at
last
and
that
they
could
do
what
they
pleased
for
the
next
two
years
long
afterward
amory
thought
of
sophomore
spring
as
the
happiest
time
of
his
life
his
ideas
were
in
tune
with
life
as
he
found
it
he
wanted
no
more
than
to
drift
and
dream
and
enjoy
a
dozen
friendships
through
the
april
afternoons
alec
connage
came
into
his
room
one
morning
and
woke
him
up
into
the
sunshine
and
peculiar
glory
of
campbell

shining
in
the
window

of
small
articles
upon

amory
cynically
sacred
trust
but

critical
goopher

said
calmly
resettling

and
reaching
beside

bed
for
a
cigarette

damned
gloom

was
out
of
bed
scattering
the
bureau
cover
burden
on
the
floor
the
coast
he
had
seen
it
for
years
since
he
and
his
mother
were
on
their
pilgrimage
who

demanded
as
he
wriggled
into
his
oh

and
oh
about
five
or

minutes
amory
was
devouring
cornflakes
in
renwick
and
at
they
bowled
happily
out
of
town
headed
for
the
sands
of
deal
beach
you
see
said
kerry
the
car
belongs

there
in
fact
it
was
stolen
from

park
by
persons

the
west

permission
from
the
city
council
to
deliver
anybody

ferrenby
turning
around
from
the
front
seat
there
was
an
emphatic
negative
chorus
that

it
money
what
money

can
sell
the
charge
him
salvage
or
how
we
going
to
get
food
asked
amory
honestly
answered
kerry
eying
him
reprovingly
do
you
doubt
ability

three
short
days
some
people
have
lived
on
nothing
for
years
at
a
time
read
the
boy
scout
three
days
amory
mused
and
i
got
one
of
the
days
is
the
just
the
same
i
can
only
cut
six
more
classes
with
over

month
and
a
half
to
throw

long
walk
amory
you
running
it
out
if
i
may
coin
a
new
had
you
better
get
some
dope
on
yourself
amory
amory
subsided
resignedly
and
drooped
into
a
contemplation
of
the
scenery
swinburne
seemed
to
fit
in
somehow
oh
winter
rains
and
ruins
are
over
and
all
the
seasons
of
snows
and
sins
the
days
dividing
lover
and
lover
the
light
that
loses
the
night
that
wins
and
time
remembered
is
grief
forgotten
and
frosts
are
slain
and
flowers
begotten
and
in
green
underwood
and
cover
blossom
by
blossom
the
spring
begins
the
full
streams
feed
on
flower
of
what
the
matter
amory
amory
thinking
about
poetry
about
the
pretty
birds
and
flowers
i
can
see
it
in
his
no
i
not
he
lied
i
thinking
about
the
princetonian
i
ought
to
make
up
but
i
can
telephone
back
i
oh
said
kerry
respectfully
these
important
men
amory
flushed
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
ferrenby
a
defeated
competitor
winced
a
little
of
course
kerry
was
only
kidding
but
he
really
must
mention
the
princetonian
it
was
a
halcyon
day
and
as
they
neared
the
shore
and
the
salt
breezes
scurried
by
he
began
to
picture
the
ocean
and
long
level
stretches
of
sand
and
red
roofs
over
blue
sea
then
they
hurried
through
the
little
town
and
it
all
flashed
upon
his
consciousness
to
a
mighty
paean
of
emotion
oh
good
lord
at
it
he
cried
what
let
me
out
quick
i
have
seen
it
for
eight
years
oh
gentlefolk
stop
the
car
what
an
odd
child
remarked
alec
i
do
believe
he
a
bit
the
car
was
obligingly
drawn
up
at
a
curb
and
amory
ran
for
the
boardwalk
first
he
realized
that
the
sea
was
blue
and
that
there
was
an
enormous
quantity
of
it
and
that
it
roared
and
roared
really
all
the
banalities
about
the
ocean
that
one
could
realize
but
if
any
one
had
told
him
then
that
these
things
were
banalities
he
would
have
gaped
in
wonder
now
we
get
lunch
ordered
kerry
wandering
up
with
the
crowd
come
on
amory
tear
yourself
away
and
get
we
try
the
best
hotel
first
he
went
on
and
thence
and
so
they
strolled
along
the
boardwalk
to
the
most
imposing
hostelry
in
sight
and
entering
the
scattered
about
a
table
eight
bronxes
commanded
alec
and
a
club
sandwich
and
juliennes
the
food
for
one
hand
the
rest
amory
ate
little
having
seized
a
chair
where
he
could
watch
the
sea
and
feel
the
rock
of
it
when
luncheon
was
over
they
sat
and
smoked
quietly
what
the
bill
some
one
scanned
it
eight
rotten
overcharge
we
give
them
two
dollars
and
one
for
the
waiter
kerry
collect
the
small
the
waiter
approached
and
kerry
gravely
handed
him
a
dollar
tossed
two
dollars
on
the
check
and
turned
away
they
sauntered
leisurely
toward
the
door
pursued
in
a
moment
by
the
suspicious
ganymede
some
mistake
kerry
took
the
bill
and
examined
it
critically
no
mistake
he
said
shaking
his
head
gravely
and
tearing
it
into
four
pieces
he
handed
the
scraps
to
the
waiter
who
was
so
dumfounded
that
he
stood
motionless
and
expressionless
while
they
walked
out
wo
he
send
after
us
no
said
kerry
for
a
minute
he
think
we
the
proprietor
sons
or
something
then
he
look
at
the
check
again
and
call
the
manager
and
in
the
meantime
they
left
the
car
at
asbury
and
to
allenhurst
where
they
investigated
the
crowded
pavilions
for
beauty
at
four
there
were
refreshments
in
a
and
this
time
they
paid
an
even
smaller
per
cent
on
the
total
cost
something
about
the
appearance
and
of
the
crowd
made
the
thing
go
and
they
were
not
pursued
you
see
amory
we
marxian
socialists
explained
kerry
we
believe
in
property
and
we
putting
it
to
the
great
night
will
descend
amory
suggested
watch
and
put
your
trust
in
they
became
jovial
about
and
linking
arms
strolled
up
and
down
the
boardwalk
in
a
row
chanting
a
monotonous
ditty
about
the
sad
sea
waves
then
kerry
saw
a
face
in
the
crowd
that
attracted
him
and
rushing
off
reappeared
in
a
moment
with
one
of
the
homeliest
girls
amory
had
ever
set
eyes
on
her
pale
mouth
extended
from
ear
to
ear
her
teeth
projected
in
a
solid
wedge
and
she
had
little
squinty
eyes
that
peeped
ingratiatingly
over
the
side
sweep
of
her
nose
kerry
presented
them
formally
name
of
kaluka
hawaiian
queen
let
me
present
connage
sloane
humbird
ferrenby
and
the
girl
bobbed
courtesies
all
around
poor
creature
amory
supposed
she
had
never
before
been
noticed
in
her
life
possibly
she
was
while
she
accompanied
them
kerry
had
invited
her
to
supper
she
said
nothing
which
could
discountenance
such
a
belief
she
prefers
her
native
dishes
said
alec
gravely
to
the
waiter
but
any
coarse
food
will
all
through
supper
he
addressed
her
in
the
most
respectful
language
while
kerry
made
idiotic
love
to
her
on
the
other
side
and
she
giggled
and
grinned
amory
was
content
to
sit
and
watch
the
thinking
what
a
light
touch
kerry
had
and
how
he
could
transform
the
barest
incident
into
a
thing
of
curve
and
contour
they
all
seemed
to
have
the
spirit
of
it
more
or
less
and
it
was
a
relaxation
to
be
with
them
amory
usually
liked
men
individually
yet
feared
them
in
crowds
unless
the
crowd
was
around
him
he
wondered
how
much
each
one
contributed
to
the
party
for
there
was
somewhat
of
a
spiritual
tax
levied
alec
and
kerry
were
the
life
of
it
but
not
quite
the
centre
somehow
the
quiet
humbird
and
sloane
with
his
impatient
superciliousness
were
the
centre
dick
humbird
had
ever
since
freshman
year
seemed
to
amory
a
perfect
type
of
aristocrat
he
was
slender
but
black
curly
hair
straight
features
and
rather
a
dark
skin
everything
he
said
sounded
intangibly
appropriate
he
possessed
infinite
courage
an
averagely
good
mind
and
a
sense
of
honor
with
a
clear
charm
and
that
varied
it
from
righteousness
he
could
dissipate
without
going
to
pieces
and
even
his
most
bohemian
adventures
never
seemed
running
it
people
dressed
like
him
tried
to
talk
as
he
did
amory
decided
that
he
probably
held
the
world
back
but
he
would
have
changed
him
he
differed
from
the
healthy
type
that
was
essentially
middle
class
he
never
seemed
to
perspire
some
people
could
be
familiar
with
a
chauffeur
without
having
it
returned
humbird
could
have
lunched
at
sherry
with
a
colored
man
yet
people
would
have
somehow
known
that
it
was
all
right
he
was
not
a
snob
though
he
knew
only
half
his
class
his
friends
ranged
from
the
highest
to
the
lowest
but
it
was
impossible
to
cultivate
him
servants
worshipped
him
and
treated
him
like
a
god
he
seemed
the
eternal
example
of
what
the
upper
class
tries
to
be
he
like
those
pictures
in
the
illustrated
london
news
of
the
english
officers
who
have
been
killed
amory
had
said
to
alec
well
alec
had
answered
if
you
want
to
know
the
shocking
truth
his
father
was
a
grocery
clerk
who
made
a
fortune
in
tacoma
real
estate
and
came
to
new
york
ten
years
amory
had
felt
a
curious
sinking
sensation
this
present
type
of
party
was
made
possible
by
the
surging
together
of
the
class
after
club
elections
as
if
to
make
a
last
desperate
attempt
to
know
itself
to
keep
together
to
fight
off
the
tightening
spirit
of
the
clubs
it
was
a
from
the
conventional
heights
they
had
all
walked
so
rigidly
after
supper
they
saw
kaluka
to
the
boardwalk
and
then
strolled
back
along
the
beach
to
asbury
the
evening
sea
was
a
new
sensation
for
all
its
color
and
mellow
age
was
gone
and
it
seemed
the
bleak
waste
that
made
the
norse
sagas
sad
amory
thought
of
beaches
of
lukanon
before
the
sealers
it
was
still
a
music
though
infinitely
sorrowful
ten
found
them
penniless
they
had
suppered
greatly
on
their
last
eleven
cents
and
singing
strolled
up
through
the
casinos
and
lighted
arches
on
the
boardwalk
stopping
to
listen
approvingly
to
all
band
concerts
in
one
place
kerry
took
up
a
collection
for
the
french
war
orphans
which
netted
a
dollar
and
twenty
cents
and
with
this
they
bought
some
brandy
in
case
they
caught
cold
in
the
night
they
finished
the
day
in
a
show
and
went
into
solemn
systematic
roars
of
laughter
at
an
ancient
comedy
to
the
startled
annoyance
of
the
rest
of
the
audience
their
entrance
was
distinctly
strategic
for
each
man
as
he
entered
pointed
reproachfully
at
the
one
just
behind
him
sloane
bringing
up
the
rear
disclaimed
all
knowledge
and
responsibility
as
soon
as
the
others
were
scattered
inside
then
as
the
irate
rushed
in
he
followed
nonchalantly
they
reassembled
later
by
the
casino
and
made
arrangements
for
the
night
kerry
wormed
permission
from
the
watchman
to
sleep
on
the
platform
and
having
collected
a
huge
pile
of
rugs
from
the
booths
to
serve
as
mattresses
and
blankets
they
talked
until
midnight
and
then
fell
into
a
dreamless
sleep
though
amory
tried
hard
to
stay
awake
and
watch
that
marvellous
moon
settle
on
the
sea
so
they
progressed
for
two
happy
days
up
and
down
the
shore
by
or
machine
or
by
on
the
crowded
boardwalk
sometimes
eating
with
the
wealthy
more
frequently
dining
frugally
at
the
expense
of
an
unsuspecting
restaurateur
they
had
their
photos
taken
eight
poses
in
a
store
kerry
insisted
on
grouping
them
as
a
varsity
football
team
and
then
as
a
tough
gang
from
the
east
side
with
their
coats
inside
out
and
himself
sitting
in
the
middle
on
a
cardboard
moon
the
photographer
probably
has
them
yet
at
least
they
never
called
for
them
the
weather
was
perfect
and
again
they
slept
outside
and
again
amory
fell
unwillingly
asleep
sunday
broke
stolid
and
respectable
and
even
the
sea
seemed
to
mumble
and
complain
so
they
returned
to
princeton
via
the
fords
of
transient
farmers
and
broke
up
with
colds
in
their
heads
but
otherwise
none
the
worse
for
wandering
even
more
than
in
the
year
before
amory
neglected
his
work
not
deliberately
but
lazily
and
through
a
multitude
of
other
interests
geometry
and
the
melancholy
hexameters
of
corneille
and
racine
held
forth
small
allurements
and
even
psychology
which
he
had
eagerly
awaited
proved
to
be
a
dull
subject
full
of
muscular
reactions
and
biological
phrases
rather
than
the
study
of
personality
and
influence
that
was
a
noon
class
and
it
always
sent
him
dozing
having
found
that
subjective
and
objective
sir
answered
most
of
the
questions
he
used
the
phrase
on
all
occasions
and
it
became
the
class
joke
when
on
a
query
being
levelled
at
him
he
was
nudged
awake
by
ferrenby
or
sloane
to
gasp
it
out
mostly
there
were
parties
to
orange
or
the
shore
more
rarely
to
new
york
and
philadelphia
though
one
night
they
marshalled
fourteen
waitresses
out
of
childs
and
took
them
to
ride
down
fifth
avenue
on
top
of
an
auto
bus
they
all
cut
more
classes
than
were
allowed
which
meant
an
additional
course
the
following
year
but
spring
was
too
rare
to
let
anything
interfere
with
their
colorful
ramblings
in
may
amory
was
elected
to
the
sophomore
prom
committee
and
when
after
a
long
evening
discussion
with
alec
they
made
out
a
tentative
list
of
class
probabilities
for
the
senior
council
they
placed
themselves
among
the
surest
the
senior
council
was
composed
presumably
of
the
eighteen
most
representative
seniors
and
in
view
of
alec
football
managership
and
amory
chance
of
nosing
out
burne
holiday
as
princetonian
chairman
they
seemed
fairly
justified
in
this
presumption
oddly
enough
they
both
placed
as
among
the
possibilities
a
guess
that
a
year
before
the
class
would
have
gaped
at
all
through
the
spring
amory
had
kept
up
an
intermittent
correspondence
with
isabelle
borge
punctuated
by
violent
squabbles
and
chiefly
enlivened
by
his
attempts
to
find
new
words
for
love
he
discovered
isabelle
to
be
discreetly
and
aggravatingly
unsentimental
in
letters
but
he
hoped
against
hope
that
she
would
prove
not
too
exotic
a
bloom
to
fit
the
large
spaces
of
spring
as
she
had
fitted
the
den
in
the
minnehaha
club
during
may
he
wrote
documents
almost
nightly
and
sent
them
to
her
in
bulky
envelopes
exteriorly
labelled
part
i
and
part
oh
alec
i
believe
i
tired
of
college
he
said
sadly
as
they
walked
the
dusk
together
i
think
i
am
too
in
a
all
i
like
would
be
a
little
home
in
the
country
some
warm
country
and
a
wife
and
just
enough
to
do
to
keep
from
me
i
like
to
what
does
your
girl
say
oh
amory
gasped
in
horror
she
would
of
marrying
that
is
not
now
i
mean
the
future
you
my
girl
would
i
are
you
really
yes
do
say
a
word
to
anybody
please
but
i
am
i
may
not
come
back
next
but
you
only
twenty
give
up
college
why
amory
you
were
saying
a
minute
ago
yes
amory
interrupted
but
i
was
just
wishing
i
would
think
of
leaving
college
it
just
that
i
feel
so
sad
these
wonderful
nights
i
sort
of
feel
they
never
coming
again
and
i
not
really
getting
all
i
could
out
of
them
i
wish
my
girl
lived
here
but
marry
not
a
chance
especially
as
father
says
the
money
is
forthcoming
as
it
used
to
what
a
waste
these
nights
are
agreed
alec
but
amory
sighed
and
made
use
of
the
nights
he
had
a
of
isabelle
enshrined
in
an
old
watch
and
at
eight
almost
every
night
he
would
turn
off
all
the
lights
except
the
desk
lamp
and
sitting
by
the
open
windows
with
the
picture
before
him
write
her
rapturous
letters
oh
it
so
hard
to
write
you
what
i
really
when
i
think
about
you
so
much
you
gotten
to
mean
to
me
a
that
i
ca
put
on
paper
any
more
your
last
letter
came
and
it
was
wonderful
i
read
it
over
about
six
times
especially
the
last
part
but
i
do
wish
sometimes
you
be
more
and
tell
me
what
you
really
do
think
of
me
yet
your
last
letter
was
too
good
to
be
true
and
i
can
hardly
wait
until
june
be
sure
and
be
able
to
come
to
the
prom
it
be
fine
i
think
and
i
want
to
bring
just
at
the
end
of
a
wonderful
year
i
often
think
over
what
you
said
on
that
night
and
wonder
how
much
you
meant
if
it
were
anyone
but
you
but
you
see
i
you
were
fickle
the
first
time
i
saw
you
and
you
are
so
popular
and
everthing
that
i
imagine
you
really
liking
me
oh
isabelle
dear
it
a
wonderful
night
somebody
is
playing
love
moon
on
a
mandolin
far
across
the
campus
and
the
music
seems
to
bring
you
into
the
window
now
he
playing
boys
i
through
and
how
well
it
suits
me
for
i
am
through
with
everything
i
have
decided
never
to
take
a
cocktail
again
and
i
know
i
never
again
fall
in
love
i
could
you
been
too
much
a
part
of
my
days
and
nights
to
ever
let
me
think
of
another
girl
i
meet
them
all
the
time
and
they
do
interest
me
i
not
pretending
to
be
blasé
because
it
not
that
it
just
that
i
in
love
oh
isabelle
somehow
i
ca
call
you
just
isabelle
and
i
afraid
i
come
out
with
the
dearest
before
your
family
this
june
you
got
to
come
to
the
prom
and
then
i
come
up
to
your
house
for
a
day
and
everything
be
perfect
and
so
on
in
an
eternal
monotone
that
seemed
to
both
of
them
infinitely
charming
infinitely
new
june
came
and
the
days
grew
so
hot
and
lazy
that
they
could
not
worry
even
about
exams
but
spent
dreamy
evenings
on
the
court
of
cottage
talking
of
long
subjects
until
the
sweep
of
country
toward
stony
brook
became
a
blue
haze
and
the
lilacs
were
white
around
and
words
gave
way
to
silent
cigarettes
then
down
deserted
prospect
and
along
mccosh
with
song
everywhere
around
them
up
to
the
hot
joviality
of
nassau
street
tom
and
amory
walked
late
in
those
days
a
gambling
fever
swept
through
the
sophomore
class
and
they
bent
over
the
bones
till
three
many
a
sultry
night
after
one
session
they
came
out
of
sloane
room
to
find
the
dew
fallen
and
the
stars
old
in
the
sky
let
borrow
bicycles
and
take
a
ride
amory
suggested
all
right
i
not
a
bit
tired
and
this
is
almost
the
last
night
of
the
year
really
because
the
prom
stuff
starts
they
found
two
unlocked
bicycles
in
holder
court
and
rode
out
about
three
along
the
lawrenceville
road
what
are
you
going
to
do
this
summer
amory
do
ask
me
same
old
things
i
suppose
a
month
or
two
in
lake
geneva
i
counting
on
you
to
be
there
in
july
you
know
then
be
minneapolis
and
that
means
hundreds
of
summer
hops
getting
bored
but
oh
tom
he
added
suddenly
has
this
year
been
slick
no
declared
tom
emphatically
a
new
tom
clothed
by
brooks
shod
by
franks
i
won
this
game
but
i
feel
as
if
i
never
want
to
play
another
you
all
right
you
a
rubber
ball
and
somehow
it
suits
you
but
i
sick
of
adapting
myself
to
the
local
snobbishness
of
this
corner
of
the
world
i
want
to
go
where
people
are
barred
because
of
the
color
of
their
neckties
and
the
roll
of
their
you
ca
tom
argued
amory
as
they
rolled
along
through
the
scattering
night
wherever
you
go
now
you
always
unconsciously
apply
these
standards
of
it
or
it
for
better
or
worse
we
stamped
you
you
a
princeton
type
well
then
complained
tom
his
cracked
voice
rising
plaintively
why
do
i
have
to
come
back
at
all
i
learned
all
that
princeton
has
to
offer
two
years
more
of
mere
pedantry
and
lying
around
a
club
going
to
help
they
just
going
to
disorganize
me
conventionalize
me
completely
even
now
i
so
spineless
that
i
wonder
how
i
get
away
with
oh
but
you
missing
the
real
point
tom
amory
interrupted
just
had
your
eyes
opened
to
the
snobbishness
of
the
world
in
a
rather
abrupt
manner
princeton
invariably
gives
the
thoughtful
man
a
social
you
consider
you
taught
me
that
do
you
he
asked
quizzically
eying
amory
in
the
half
dark
amory
laughed
quietly
did
i
sometimes
he
said
slowly
i
think
you
my
bad
angel
i
might
have
been
a
pretty
fair
come
on
that
rather
hard
you
chose
to
come
to
an
eastern
college
either
your
eyes
were
opened
to
the
mean
scrambling
quality
of
people
or
you
have
gone
through
blind
and
you
hate
to
have
done
that
been
like
marty
yes
he
agreed
you
right
i
would
have
liked
it
still
hard
to
be
made
a
cynic
at
i
was
born
one
amory
murmured
i
a
cynical
he
paused
and
wondered
if
that
meant
anything
they
reached
the
sleeping
school
of
lawrenceville
and
turned
to
ride
back
it
good
this
ride
is
it
tom
said
presently
yes
it
a
good
finish
it
everything
good
oh
for
a
hot
languorous
summer
and
isabelle
oh
you
and
your
isabelle
i
bet
she
a
simple
one
let
say
some
so
amory
declaimed
the
ode
to
a
nightingale
to
the
bushes
they
passed
i
never
be
a
poet
said
amory
as
he
finished
i
not
enough
of
a
sensualist
really
there
are
only
a
few
obvious
things
that
i
notice
as
primarily
beautiful
women
spring
evenings
music
at
night
the
sea
i
do
catch
the
subtle
things
like
trumpets
i
may
turn
out
an
intellectual
but
i
never
write
anything
but
mediocre
they
rode
into
princeton
as
the
sun
was
making
colored
maps
of
the
sky
behind
the
graduate
school
and
hurried
to
the
refreshment
of
a
shower
that
would
have
to
serve
in
place
of
sleep
by
noon
the
alumni
crowded
the
streets
with
their
bands
and
choruses
and
in
the
tents
there
was
great
reunion
under
the
banners
that
curled
and
strained
in
the
wind
amory
looked
long
at
one
house
which
bore
the
legend
there
a
few
men
sat
and
talked
quietly
while
the
classes
swept
by
in
panorama
of
life
under
the
then
tragedy
emerald
eyes
glared
suddenly
at
amory
over
the
edge
of
june
on
the
night
after
his
ride
to
lawrenceville
a
crowd
sallied
to
new
york
in
quest
of
adventure
and
started
back
to
princeton
about
twelve
in
two
machines
it
had
been
a
gay
party
and
different
stages
of
sobriety
were
represented
amory
was
in
the
car
behind
they
had
taken
the
wrong
road
and
lost
the
way
and
so
were
hurrying
to
catch
up
it
was
a
clear
night
and
the
exhilaration
of
the
road
went
to
head
he
had
the
ghost
of
two
stanzas
of
a
poem
forming
in
his
mind
so
the
gray
car
crept
nightward
in
the
dark
and
there
was
no
life
stirred
as
it
went
by
as
the
still
ocean
paths
before
the
shark
in
starred
and
glittering
waterways
the
trees
divided
pair
on
pair
while
flapping
nightbirds
cried
across
the
air
a
moment
by
an
inn
of
lamps
and
shades
a
yellow
inn
under
a
yellow
moon
then
silence
where
crescendo
laughter
fades
the
car
swung
out
again
to
the
winds
of
june
mellowed
the
shadows
where
the
distance
grew
then
crushed
the
yellow
shadows
into
blue
they
jolted
to
a
stop
and
amory
peered
up
startled
a
woman
was
standing
beside
the
road
talking
to
alec
at
the
wheel
afterward
he
remembered
the
harpy
effect
that
her
old
kimono
gave
her
and
the
cracked
hollowness
of
her
voice
as
she
spoke
you
princeton
boys
well
there
one
of
you
killed
here
and
two
others
about
god
look
she
pointed
and
they
gazed
in
horror
under
the
full
light
of
a
roadside
lay
a
form
face
downward
in
a
widening
circle
of
blood
they
sprang
from
the
car
amory
thought
of
the
back
of
that
head
that
hair
that
hair
and
then
they
turned
the
form
over
it
dick
dick
humbird
oh
christ
feel
his
heart
then
the
insistent
voice
of
the
old
crone
in
a
sort
of
croaking
triumph
he
quite
dead
all
right
the
car
turned
over
two
of
the
men
that
were
hurt
just
carried
the
others
in
but
this
one
no
amory
rushed
into
the
house
and
the
rest
followed
with
a
limp
mass
that
they
laid
on
the
sofa
in
the
shoddy
little
front
parlor
sloane
with
his
shoulder
punctured
was
on
another
lounge
he
was
half
delirious
and
kept
calling
something
about
a
chemistry
lecture
at
i
do
know
what
happened
said
ferrenby
in
a
strained
voice
dick
was
driving
and
he
would
give
up
the
wheel
we
told
him
he
been
drinking
too
much
then
there
was
this
damn
curve
oh
my
he
threw
himself
face
downward
on
the
floor
and
broke
into
dry
sobs
the
doctor
had
arrived
and
amory
went
over
to
the
couch
where
some
one
handed
him
a
sheet
to
put
over
the
body
with
a
sudden
hardness
he
raised
one
of
the
hands
and
let
it
fall
back
inertly
the
brow
was
cold
but
the
face
not
expressionless
he
looked
at
the
dick
had
tied
them
that
morning
had
tied
them
and
now
he
was
this
heavy
white
mass
all
that
remained
of
the
charm
and
personality
of
the
dick
humbird
he
had
known
oh
it
was
all
so
horrible
and
unaristocratic
and
close
to
the
earth
all
tragedy
has
that
strain
of
the
grotesque
and
squalid
so
useless
futile
the
way
animals
die
amory
was
reminded
of
a
cat
that
had
lain
horribly
mangled
in
some
alley
of
his
childhood
some
one
go
to
princeton
with
amory
stepped
outside
the
door
and
shivered
slightly
at
the
late
night
wind
a
wind
that
stirred
a
broken
fender
on
the
mass
of
bent
metal
to
a
plaintive
tinny
sound
crescendo
next
day
by
a
merciful
chance
passed
in
a
whirl
when
amory
was
by
himself
his
thoughts
zigzagged
inevitably
to
the
picture
of
that
red
mouth
yawning
incongruously
in
the
white
face
but
with
a
determined
effort
he
piled
present
excitement
upon
the
memory
of
it
and
shut
it
coldly
away
from
his
mind
isabelle
and
her
mother
drove
into
town
at
four
and
they
rode
up
smiling
prospect
avenue
through
the
gay
crowd
to
have
tea
at
cottage
the
clubs
had
their
annual
dinners
that
night
so
at
seven
he
loaned
her
to
a
freshman
and
arranged
to
meet
her
in
the
gymnasium
at
eleven
when
the
upper
classmen
were
admitted
to
the
freshman
dance
she
was
all
he
had
expected
and
he
was
happy
and
eager
to
make
that
night
the
centre
of
every
dream
at
nine
the
upper
classes
stood
in
front
of
the
clubs
as
the
freshman
torchlight
parade
rioted
past
and
amory
wondered
if
the
groups
against
the
dark
stately
backgrounds
and
under
the
flare
of
the
torches
made
the
night
as
brilliant
to
the
staring
cheering
freshmen
as
it
had
been
to
him
the
year
before
the
next
day
was
another
whirl
they
lunched
in
a
gay
party
of
six
in
a
private
at
the
club
while
isabelle
and
amory
looked
at
each
other
tenderly
over
the
fried
chicken
and
knew
that
their
love
was
to
be
eternal
they
danced
away
the
prom
until
five
and
the
stags
cut
in
on
isabelle
with
joyous
abandon
which
grew
more
and
more
enthusiastic
as
the
hour
grew
late
and
their
wines
stored
in
overcoat
pockets
in
the
coat
room
made
old
weariness
wait
until
another
day
the
stag
line
is
a
most
homogeneous
mass
of
men
it
fairly
sways
with
a
single
soul
a
beauty
dances
by
and
there
is
a
sound
as
the
ripple
surges
forward
and
some
one
sleeker
than
the
rest
darts
out
and
cuts
in
then
when
the
girl
brought
by
kaye
in
your
class
and
to
whom
he
has
been
trying
to
introduce
you
all
evening
gallops
by
the
line
surges
back
and
the
groups
face
about
and
become
intent
on
far
corners
of
the
hall
for
kaye
anxious
and
perspiring
appears
elbowing
through
the
crowd
in
search
of
familiar
faces
i
say
old
man
i
got
an
awfully
nice
sorry
kaye
but
i
set
for
this
one
i
got
to
cut
in
on
a
well
the
next
one
what
ah
er
i
swear
i
got
to
go
cut
in
look
me
up
when
she
got
a
dance
it
delighted
amory
when
isabelle
suggested
that
they
leave
for
a
while
and
drive
around
in
her
car
for
a
delicious
hour
that
passed
too
soon
they
glided
the
silent
roads
about
princeton
and
talked
from
the
surface
of
their
hearts
in
shy
excitement
amory
felt
strangely
ingenuous
and
made
no
attempt
to
kiss
her
next
day
they
rode
up
through
the
jersey
country
had
luncheon
in
new
york
and
in
the
afternoon
went
to
see
a
problem
play
at
which
isabelle
wept
all
through
the
second
act
rather
to
amory
embarrassment
though
it
filled
him
with
tenderness
to
watch
her
he
was
tempted
to
lean
over
and
kiss
away
her
tears
and
she
slipped
her
hand
into
his
under
cover
of
darkness
to
be
pressed
softly
then
at
six
they
arrived
at
the
borges
summer
place
on
long
island
and
amory
rushed
to
change
into
a
dinner
coat
as
he
put
in
his
studs
he
realized
that
he
was
enjoying
life
as
he
would
probably
never
enjoy
it
again
everything
was
hallowed
by
the
haze
of
his
own
youth
he
had
arrived
abreast
of
the
best
in
his
generation
at
princeton
he
was
in
love
and
his
love
was
returned
turning
on
all
the
lights
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
trying
to
find
in
his
own
face
the
qualities
that
made
him
see
clearer
than
the
great
crowd
of
people
that
made
him
decide
firmly
and
able
to
influence
and
follow
his
own
will
there
was
little
in
his
life
now
that
he
would
have
changed
oxford
might
have
been
a
bigger
field
silently
he
admired
himself
how
conveniently
well
he
looked
and
how
well
a
dinner
coat
became
him
he
stepped
into
the
hall
and
then
waited
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
for
he
heard
footsteps
coming
it
was
isabelle
and
from
the
top
of
her
shining
hair
to
her
little
golden
slippers
she
had
never
seemed
so
beautiful
isabelle
he
cried
half
involuntarily
and
held
out
his
arms
as
in
the
she
ran
into
them
and
on
that
as
their
lips
first
touched
rested
the
high
point
of
vanity
the
crest
of
his
young
egotism
chapter
the
egotist
considers
ouch
let
me
go
he
dropped
his
arms
to
his
sides
what
the
matter
your
shirt
stud
it
hurt
me
look
she
was
looking
down
at
her
neck
where
a
little
blue
spot
about
the
size
of
a
pea
marred
its
pallor
oh
isabelle
he
reproached
himself
i
a
goopher
really
sorry
i
should
have
held
you
so
she
looked
up
impatiently
oh
amory
of
course
you
could
help
it
and
it
did
hurt
much
but
what
we
going
to
do
about
it
about
it
he
asked
oh
that
spot
it
disappear
in
a
it
is
she
said
after
a
moment
of
concentrated
gazing
it
still
there
and
it
looks
like
old
nick
oh
amory
what
we
do
it
the
height
of
your
massage
it
he
suggested
repressing
the
faintest
inclination
to
laugh
she
rubbed
it
delicately
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
and
then
a
tear
gathered
in
the
corner
of
her
eye
and
slid
down
her
cheek
oh
amory
she
said
despairingly
lifting
up
a
most
pathetic
face
i
just
make
my
whole
neck
if
i
rub
it
what
i
do
a
quotation
sailed
into
his
head
and
he
could
resist
repeating
it
aloud
all
the
perfumes
of
arabia
will
not
whiten
this
little
she
looked
up
and
the
sparkle
of
the
tear
in
her
eye
was
like
ice
you
not
very
amory
mistook
her
meaning
isabelle
darling
i
think
it
do
touch
me
she
cried
have
i
enough
on
my
mind
and
you
stand
there
and
then
he
slipped
again
well
it
funny
isabelle
and
we
were
talking
the
other
day
about
a
sense
of
humor
being
she
was
looking
at
him
with
something
that
was
not
a
smile
rather
the
faint
mirthless
echo
of
a
smile
in
the
corners
of
her
mouth
oh
shut
up
she
cried
suddenly
and
fled
down
the
hallway
toward
her
room
amory
stood
there
covered
with
remorseful
confusion
damn
when
isabelle
reappeared
she
had
thrown
a
light
wrap
about
her
shoulders
and
they
descended
the
stairs
in
a
silence
that
endured
through
dinner
isabelle
he
began
rather
testily
as
they
arranged
themselves
in
the
car
bound
for
a
dance
at
the
greenwich
country
club
you
angry
and
i
be
too
in
a
minute
let
kiss
and
make
isabelle
considered
glumly
i
hate
to
be
laughed
at
she
said
finally
i
wo
laugh
any
more
i
not
laughing
now
am
i
you
oh
do
be
so
darned
her
lips
curled
slightly
i
be
anything
i
amory
kept
his
temper
with
difficulty
he
became
aware
that
he
had
not
an
ounce
of
real
affection
for
isabelle
but
her
coldness
piqued
him
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
kiss
her
a
lot
because
then
he
knew
he
could
leave
in
the
morning
and
not
care
on
the
contrary
if
he
did
kiss
her
it
would
worry
him
it
would
interfere
vaguely
with
his
idea
of
himself
as
a
conqueror
it
was
dignified
to
come
off
second
best
with
a
doughty
warrior
like
isabelle
perhaps
she
suspected
this
at
any
rate
amory
watched
the
night
that
should
have
been
the
consummation
of
romance
glide
by
with
great
moths
overhead
and
the
heavy
fragrance
of
roadside
gardens
but
without
those
broken
words
those
little
sighs
afterward
they
suppered
on
ginger
ale
and
devil
food
in
the
pantry
and
amory
announced
a
decision
i
leaving
early
in
the
why
why
not
he
countered
there
no
however
i
well
if
you
insist
on
being
ridiculous
oh
do
put
it
that
way
he
objected
just
because
i
wo
let
you
kiss
me
do
you
think
now
isabelle
he
interrupted
you
know
it
not
that
even
suppose
it
is
we
reached
the
stage
where
we
either
ought
to
kiss
or
or
nothing
it
is
as
if
you
were
refusing
on
moral
she
hesitated
i
really
do
know
what
to
think
about
you
she
began
in
a
feeble
perverse
attempt
at
conciliation
you
so
how
well
i
thought
you
had
a
lot
of
and
all
that
remember
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
you
could
do
anything
you
wanted
or
get
anything
you
wanted
amory
flushed
he
told
her
a
lot
of
things
well
you
did
seem
to
feel
so
maybe
just
plain
no
i
not
he
hesitated
at
princeton
oh
you
and
princeton
you
think
that
was
the
world
the
way
you
talk
perhaps
you
write
better
than
anybody
else
on
your
old
princetonian
maybe
the
freshmen
think
you
important
you
do
understand
yes
i
do
she
interrupted
i
because
you
always
talking
about
yourself
and
i
used
to
like
it
now
i
have
i
that
just
the
point
insisted
isabelle
you
got
all
upset
you
just
sat
and
watched
my
eyes
besides
i
have
to
think
all
the
time
i
talking
to
you
you
so
i
make
you
think
do
i
amory
repeated
with
a
touch
of
vanity
you
a
nervous
strain
this
emphatically
and
when
you
analyze
every
little
emotion
and
instinct
i
just
do
have
i
amory
admitted
her
point
and
shook
his
head
helplessly
let
she
stood
up
he
rose
abstractedly
and
they
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
what
train
can
i
get
there
one
about
if
you
really
must
yes
i
got
to
go
really
good
good
they
were
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
and
as
amory
turned
into
his
room
he
thought
he
caught
just
the
faintest
cloud
of
discontent
in
her
face
he
lay
awake
in
the
darkness
and
wondered
how
much
he
cared
how
much
of
his
sudden
unhappiness
was
hurt
vanity
whether
he
was
after
all
temperamentally
unfitted
for
romance
when
he
awoke
it
was
with
a
glad
flood
of
consciousness
the
early
wind
stirred
the
chintz
curtains
at
the
windows
and
he
was
idly
puzzled
not
to
be
in
his
room
at
princeton
with
his
school
football
picture
over
the
bureau
and
the
triangle
club
on
the
wall
opposite
then
the
grandfather
clock
in
the
hall
outside
struck
eight
and
the
memory
of
the
night
before
came
to
him
he
was
out
of
bed
dressing
like
the
wind
he
must
get
out
of
the
house
before
he
saw
isabelle
what
had
seemed
a
melancholy
happening
now
seemed
a
tiresome
anticlimax
he
was
dressed
at
half
past
so
he
sat
down
by
the
window
felt
that
the
sinews
of
his
heart
were
twisted
somewhat
more
than
he
had
thought
what
an
ironic
mockery
the
morning
seemed
bright
and
sunny
and
full
of
the
smell
of
the
garden
hearing
borge
voice
in
the
below
he
wondered
where
was
isabelle
there
was
a
knock
at
the
door
the
car
will
be
around
at
ten
minutes
of
nine
he
returned
to
his
contemplation
of
the
outdoors
and
began
repeating
over
and
over
mechanically
a
verse
from
browning
which
he
had
once
quoted
to
isabelle
in
a
letter
each
life
unfulfilled
you
see
it
hangs
still
patchy
and
scrappy
we
have
not
sighed
deep
laughed
free
starved
feasted
despaired
been
but
his
life
would
not
be
unfulfilled
he
took
a
sombre
satisfaction
in
thinking
that
perhaps
all
along
she
had
been
nothing
except
what
he
had
read
into
her
that
this
was
her
high
point
that
no
one
else
would
ever
make
her
think
yet
that
was
what
she
had
objected
to
in
him
and
amory
was
suddenly
tired
of
thinking
thinking
damn
her
he
said
bitterly
she
spoiled
my
year
the
superman
grows
careless
on
a
dusty
day
in
september
amory
arrived
in
princeton
and
joined
the
sweltering
crowd
of
conditioned
men
who
thronged
the
streets
it
seemed
a
stupid
way
to
commence
his
years
to
spend
four
hours
a
morning
in
the
stuffy
room
of
a
tutoring
school
imbibing
the
infinite
boredom
of
conic
sections
rooney
pander
to
the
dull
conducted
the
class
and
smoked
innumerable
pall
malls
as
he
drew
diagrams
and
worked
equations
from
six
in
the
morning
until
midnight
now
langueduc
if
i
used
that
formula
where
would
my
a
point
be
langueduc
lazily
shifts
his
of
football
material
and
tries
to
concentrate
oh
ah
i
damned
if
i
know
oh
why
of
course
of
course
you
ca
that
formula
what
i
wanted
you
to
why
sure
of
do
you
see
why
you
bet
i
suppose
if
you
do
see
tell
me
i
here
to
show
well
rooney
if
you
do
mind
i
wish
you
go
over
that
gladly
now
here
the
room
was
a
study
in
stupidity
two
huge
stands
for
paper
rooney
in
his
in
front
of
them
and
slouched
around
on
chairs
a
dozen
men
fred
sloane
the
pitcher
who
absolutely
to
get
eligible
slim
langueduc
who
would
beat
yale
this
fall
if
only
he
could
master
a
poor
fifty
per
cent
mcdowell
gay
young
sophomore
who
thought
it
was
quite
a
sporting
thing
to
be
tutoring
here
with
all
these
prominent
athletes
those
poor
birds
who
have
a
cent
to
tutor
and
have
to
study
during
the
term
are
the
ones
i
pity
he
announced
to
amory
one
day
with
a
flaccid
camaraderie
in
the
droop
of
the
cigarette
from
his
pale
lips
i
should
think
it
would
be
such
a
bore
there
so
much
else
to
do
in
new
york
during
the
term
i
suppose
they
do
know
what
they
miss
there
was
such
an
air
of
you
and
i
about
mcdowell
that
amory
very
nearly
pushed
him
out
of
the
open
window
when
he
said
this
next
february
his
mother
would
wonder
why
he
did
make
a
club
and
increase
his
allowance
simple
little
nut
through
the
smoke
and
the
air
of
solemn
dense
earnestness
that
filled
the
room
would
come
the
inevitable
helpless
cry
i
do
get
it
repeat
that
rooney
most
of
them
were
so
stupid
or
careless
that
they
would
admit
when
they
did
understand
and
amory
was
of
the
latter
he
found
it
impossible
to
study
conic
sections
something
in
their
calm
and
tantalizing
respectability
breathing
defiantly
through
rooney
fetid
parlors
distorted
their
equations
into
insoluble
anagrams
he
made
a
last
night
effort
with
the
proverbial
wet
towel
and
then
blissfully
took
the
exam
wondering
unhappily
why
all
the
color
and
ambition
of
the
spring
before
had
faded
out
somehow
with
the
defection
of
isabelle
the
idea
of
undergraduate
success
had
loosed
its
grasp
on
his
imagination
and
he
contemplated
a
possible
failure
to
pass
off
his
condition
with
equanimity
even
though
it
would
arbitrarily
mean
his
removal
from
the
princetonian
board
and
the
slaughter
of
his
chances
for
the
senior
council
there
was
always
his
luck
he
yawned
scribbled
his
honor
pledge
on
the
cover
and
sauntered
from
the
room
if
you
do
pass
it
said
the
newly
arrived
alec
as
they
sat
on
the
of
amory
room
and
mused
upon
a
scheme
of
wall
decoration
you
the
world
worst
goopher
your
stock
will
go
down
like
an
elevator
at
the
club
and
on
the
oh
hell
i
know
it
why
rub
it
in
you
deserve
it
anybody
that
risk
what
you
were
in
line
for
to
be
ineligible
for
princetonian
oh
drop
the
subject
amory
protested
watch
and
wait
and
shut
up
i
do
want
every
one
at
the
club
asking
me
about
it
as
if
i
were
a
prize
potato
being
fattened
for
a
vegetable
one
evening
a
week
later
amory
stopped
below
his
own
window
on
the
way
to
renwick
and
seeing
a
light
called
up
oh
tom
any
mail
alec
head
appeared
against
the
yellow
square
of
light
yes
your
result
his
heart
clamored
violently
what
is
it
blue
or
pink
do
know
better
come
he
walked
into
the
room
and
straight
over
to
the
table
and
then
suddenly
noticed
that
there
were
other
people
in
the
room
he
was
most
polite
ah
men
of
they
seemed
to
be
mostly
friends
so
he
picked
up
the
envelope
marked
office
and
weighed
it
nervously
we
have
here
quite
a
slip
of
open
it
just
to
be
dramatic
i
let
you
know
that
if
it
blue
my
name
is
withdrawn
from
the
editorial
board
of
the
prince
and
my
short
career
is
he
paused
and
then
saw
for
the
first
time
ferrenby
eyes
wearing
a
hungry
look
and
watching
him
eagerly
amory
returned
the
gaze
pointedly
watch
my
face
gentlemen
for
the
primitive
he
tore
it
open
and
held
the
slip
up
to
the
light
well
pink
or
blue
say
what
it
we
all
ears
smile
or
swear
or
there
was
a
pause
a
small
crowd
of
seconds
swept
by
then
he
looked
again
and
another
crowd
went
on
into
time
blue
as
the
sky
gentlemen
aftermath
what
amory
did
that
year
from
early
september
to
late
in
the
spring
was
so
purposeless
and
inconsecutive
that
it
seems
scarcely
worth
recording
he
was
of
course
immediately
sorry
for
what
he
had
lost
his
philosophy
of
success
had
tumbled
down
upon
him
and
he
looked
for
the
reasons
your
own
laziness
said
alec
later
no
something
deeper
than
that
i
begun
to
feel
that
i
was
meant
to
lose
this
they
rather
off
you
at
the
club
you
know
every
man
that
come
through
makes
our
crowd
just
so
much
i
hate
that
point
of
of
course
with
a
little
effort
you
could
still
stage
a
no
i
through
as
far
as
ever
being
a
power
in
college
is
but
amory
honestly
what
makes
me
the
angriest
is
the
fact
that
you
wo
be
chairman
of
the
prince
and
on
the
senior
council
but
just
that
you
did
get
down
and
pass
that
not
me
said
amory
slowly
i
mad
at
the
concrete
thing
my
own
idleness
was
quite
in
accord
with
my
system
but
the
luck
your
system
broke
you
well
what
are
you
going
to
do
get
a
better
one
quick
or
just
bum
around
for
two
more
years
as
a
i
do
know
yet
oh
amory
buck
up
amory
point
of
view
though
dangerous
was
not
far
from
the
true
one
if
his
reactions
to
his
environment
could
be
tabulated
the
chart
would
have
appeared
like
this
beginning
with
his
earliest
years
the
fundamental
amory
amory
plus
beatrice
amory
plus
beatrice
plus
minneapolis
then
regis
had
pulled
him
to
pieces
and
started
him
over
again
amory
plus
regis
amory
plus
regis
plus
princeton
that
had
been
his
nearest
approach
to
success
through
conformity
the
fundamental
amory
idle
imaginative
rebellious
had
been
nearly
snowed
under
he
had
conformed
he
had
succeeded
but
as
his
imagination
was
neither
satisfied
nor
grasped
by
his
own
success
he
had
listlessly
chucked
the
whole
thing
and
become
again
the
fundamental
amory
financial
his
father
died
quietly
and
inconspicuously
at
thanksgiving
the
incongruity
of
death
with
either
the
beauties
of
lake
geneva
or
with
his
mother
dignified
reticent
attitude
diverted
him
and
he
looked
at
the
funeral
with
an
amused
tolerance
he
decided
that
burial
was
after
all
preferable
to
cremation
and
he
smiled
at
his
old
boyhood
choice
slow
oxidation
in
the
top
of
a
tree
the
day
after
the
ceremony
he
was
amusing
himself
in
the
great
library
by
sinking
back
on
a
couch
in
graceful
mortuary
attitudes
trying
to
determine
whether
he
would
when
his
day
came
be
found
with
his
arms
crossed
piously
over
his
chest
monsignor
darcy
had
once
advocated
this
posture
as
being
the
most
distinguished
or
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
a
more
pagan
and
byronic
attitude
what
interested
him
much
more
than
the
final
departure
of
his
father
from
things
mundane
was
a
conversation
between
beatrice
barton
of
barton
and
krogman
their
lawyers
and
himself
that
took
place
several
days
after
the
funeral
for
the
first
time
he
came
into
actual
cognizance
of
the
family
finances
and
realized
what
a
tidy
fortune
had
once
been
under
his
father
management
he
took
a
ledger
labelled
and
ran
through
it
rather
carefully
the
total
expenditure
that
year
had
come
to
something
over
one
hundred
and
ten
thousand
dollars
forty
thousand
of
this
had
been
beatrice
own
income
and
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
account
for
it
it
was
all
under
the
heading
drafts
checks
and
letters
of
credit
forwarded
to
beatrice
the
dispersal
of
the
rest
was
rather
minutely
itemized
the
taxes
and
improvements
on
the
lake
geneva
estate
had
come
to
almost
nine
thousand
dollars
the
general
including
beatrice
electric
and
a
french
car
bought
that
year
was
over
thousand
dollars
the
rest
was
fully
taken
care
of
and
there
were
invariably
items
which
failed
to
balance
on
the
right
side
of
the
ledger
in
the
volume
for
amory
was
shocked
to
discover
the
decrease
in
the
number
of
bond
holdings
and
the
great
drop
in
the
income
in
the
case
of
beatrice
money
this
was
not
so
pronounced
but
it
was
obvious
that
his
father
had
devoted
the
previous
year
to
several
unfortunate
gambles
in
oil
very
little
of
the
oil
had
been
burned
but
stephen
blaine
had
been
rather
badly
singed
the
next
year
and
the
next
and
the
next
showed
similar
decreases
and
beatrice
had
for
the
first
time
begun
using
her
own
money
for
keeping
up
the
house
yet
her
doctor
bill
for
had
been
over
nine
thousand
dollars
about
the
exact
state
of
things
barton
was
quite
vague
and
confused
there
had
been
recent
investments
the
outcome
of
which
was
for
the
present
problematical
and
he
had
an
idea
there
were
further
speculations
and
exchanges
concerning
which
he
had
not
been
consulted
it
was
not
for
several
months
that
beatrice
wrote
amory
the
full
situation
the
entire
residue
of
the
blaine
and
fortunes
consisted
of
the
place
at
lake
geneva
and
approximately
a
half
million
dollars
invested
now
in
fairly
conservative
holdings
in
fact
beatrice
wrote
that
she
was
putting
the
money
into
railroad
and
bonds
as
fast
as
she
could
conveniently
transfer
it
i
am
quite
sure
she
wrote
to
amory
that
if
there
is
one
thing
we
can
be
positive
of
it
is
that
people
will
not
stay
in
one
place
this
ford
person
has
certainly
made
the
most
of
that
idea
so
i
am
instructing
barton
to
specialize
on
such
things
as
northern
pacific
and
these
rapid
transit
companies
as
they
call
the
i
shall
never
forgive
myself
for
not
buying
bethlehem
steel
i
heard
the
most
fascinating
stories
you
must
go
into
finance
amory
i
sure
you
would
revel
in
it
you
start
as
a
messenger
or
a
teller
i
believe
and
from
that
you
go
up
almost
indefinitely
i
sure
if
i
were
a
man
i
love
the
handling
of
money
it
has
become
quite
a
senile
passion
with
me
before
i
get
any
farther
i
want
to
discuss
something
a
bispam
an
overcordial
little
lady
whom
i
met
at
a
tea
the
other
day
told
me
that
her
son
he
is
at
yale
wrote
her
that
all
the
boys
there
wore
their
summer
underwear
all
during
the
winter
and
also
went
about
with
their
heads
wet
and
in
low
shoes
on
the
coldest
days
now
amory
i
do
know
whether
that
is
a
fad
at
princeton
too
but
i
do
want
you
to
be
so
foolish
it
not
only
inclines
a
young
man
to
pneumonia
and
infantile
paralysis
but
to
all
forms
of
lung
trouble
to
which
you
are
particularly
inclined
you
can
not
experiment
with
your
health
i
have
found
that
out
i
will
not
make
myself
ridiculous
as
some
mothers
no
doubt
do
by
insisting
that
you
wear
overshoes
though
i
remember
one
christmas
you
wore
them
around
constantly
without
a
single
buckle
latched
making
such
a
curious
swishing
sound
and
you
refused
to
buckle
them
because
it
was
not
the
thing
to
do
the
very
next
christmas
you
would
not
wear
even
rubbers
though
i
begged
you
you
are
nearly
twenty
years
old
now
dear
and
i
ca
be
with
you
constantly
to
find
whether
you
are
doing
the
sensible
thing
this
has
been
a
very
letter
i
warned
you
in
my
last
that
the
lack
of
money
to
do
the
things
one
wants
to
makes
one
quite
prosy
and
domestic
but
there
is
still
plenty
for
everything
if
we
are
not
too
extravagant
take
care
of
yourself
my
dear
boy
and
do
try
to
write
at
least
a
week
because
i
imagine
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
if
i
do
hear
from
you
affectionately
first
appearance
of
the
term
personage
monsignor
darcy
invited
amory
up
to
the
stuart
palace
on
the
hudson
for
a
week
at
christmas
and
they
had
enormous
conversations
around
the
open
fire
monsignor
was
growing
a
trifle
stouter
and
his
personality
had
expanded
even
with
that
and
amory
felt
both
rest
and
security
in
sinking
into
a
squat
cushioned
chair
and
joining
him
in
the
sanity
of
a
cigar
i
felt
like
leaving
college
why
all
my
career
gone
up
in
smoke
you
think
it
petty
and
all
that
but
not
at
all
petty
i
think
it
most
important
i
want
to
hear
the
whole
thing
everything
you
been
doing
since
i
saw
you
amory
talked
he
went
thoroughly
into
the
destruction
of
his
egotistic
highways
and
in
a
the
listless
quality
had
left
his
voice
what
would
you
do
if
you
left
college
asked
monsignor
do
know
i
like
to
travel
but
of
course
this
tiresome
war
prevents
that
anyways
mother
would
hate
not
having
me
graduate
just
at
sea
kerry
holiday
wants
me
to
go
over
with
him
and
join
the
lafayette
you
know
you
would
like
to
sometimes
i
would
i
go
in
a
well
you
have
to
be
very
much
more
tired
of
life
than
i
think
you
are
i
know
i
afraid
you
do
agreed
amory
reluctantly
it
just
seemed
an
easy
way
out
of
everything
when
i
think
of
another
useless
draggy
yes
i
know
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
not
worried
about
you
you
seem
to
me
to
be
progressing
perfectly
no
amory
objected
i
lost
half
my
personality
in
a
not
a
bit
of
it
scoffed
monsignor
you
lost
a
great
amount
of
vanity
and
that
lordy
i
feel
anyway
as
if
i
gone
through
another
fifth
form
at
monsignor
shook
his
head
that
was
a
misfortune
this
has
been
a
good
thing
whatever
worth
while
comes
to
you
wo
be
through
the
channels
you
were
searching
last
what
could
be
more
unprofitable
than
my
present
lack
of
pep
perhaps
in
itself
but
you
developing
this
has
given
you
time
to
think
and
you
casting
off
a
lot
of
your
old
luggage
about
success
and
the
superman
and
all
people
like
us
ca
adopt
whole
theories
as
you
did
if
we
can
do
the
next
thing
and
have
an
hour
a
day
to
think
in
we
can
accomplish
marvels
but
as
far
as
any
scheme
of
blind
dominance
is
concerned
we
just
make
asses
of
but
monsignor
i
ca
do
the
next
amory
between
you
and
me
i
have
only
just
learned
to
do
it
myself
i
can
do
the
one
hundred
things
beyond
the
next
thing
but
i
stub
my
toe
on
that
just
as
you
stubbed
your
toe
on
mathematics
this
why
do
we
have
to
do
the
next
thing
it
never
seems
the
sort
of
thing
i
should
we
have
to
do
it
because
we
not
personalities
but
that
a
good
line
what
do
you
mean
a
personality
is
what
you
thought
you
were
what
this
kerry
and
sloane
you
tell
me
of
evidently
are
personality
is
a
physical
matter
almost
entirely
it
lowers
the
people
it
acts
on
i
seen
it
vanish
in
a
long
sickness
but
while
a
personality
is
active
it
overrides
next
thing
now
a
personage
on
the
other
hand
gathers
he
is
never
thought
of
apart
from
what
he
done
he
a
bar
on
which
a
thousand
things
have
been
hung
glittering
things
sometimes
as
ours
are
but
he
uses
those
things
with
a
cold
mentality
back
of
and
several
of
my
most
glittering
possessions
had
fallen
off
when
i
needed
amory
continued
the
simile
eagerly
yes
that
it
when
you
feel
that
your
garnered
prestige
and
talents
and
all
that
are
hung
out
you
need
never
bother
about
anybody
you
can
cope
with
them
without
but
on
the
other
hand
if
i
have
my
possessions
i
helpless
that
certainly
an
now
you
a
clean
start
a
start
kerry
or
sloane
can
constitutionally
never
have
you
brushed
three
or
four
ornaments
down
and
in
a
fit
of
pique
knocked
off
the
rest
of
them
the
thing
now
is
to
collect
some
new
ones
and
the
farther
you
look
ahead
in
the
collecting
the
better
but
remember
do
the
next
thing
how
clear
you
can
make
things
so
they
talked
often
about
themselves
sometimes
of
philosophy
and
religion
and
life
as
respectively
a
game
or
a
mystery
the
priest
seemed
to
guess
amory
thoughts
before
they
were
clear
in
his
own
head
so
closely
related
were
their
minds
in
form
and
groove
why
do
i
make
lists
amory
asked
him
one
night
lists
of
all
sorts
of
things
because
you
a
mediaevalist
monsignor
answered
we
both
are
the
passion
for
classifying
and
finding
a
it
a
desire
to
get
something
it
the
nucleus
of
scholastic
i
was
beginning
to
think
i
was
growing
eccentric
till
i
came
up
here
it
was
a
pose
i
do
worry
about
that
for
you
not
posing
may
be
the
biggest
pose
of
all
pose
yes
but
do
the
next
after
amory
returned
to
college
he
received
several
letters
from
monsignor
which
gave
him
more
egotistic
food
for
consumption
i
am
afraid
that
i
gave
you
too
much
assurance
of
your
inevitable
safety
and
you
must
remember
that
i
did
that
through
faith
in
your
springs
of
effort
not
in
the
silly
conviction
that
you
will
arrive
without
struggle
some
nuances
of
character
you
will
have
to
take
for
granted
in
yourself
though
you
must
be
careful
in
confessing
them
to
others
you
are
unsentimental
almost
incapable
of
affection
astute
without
being
cunning
and
vain
without
being
proud
do
let
yourself
feel
worthless
often
through
life
you
will
really
be
at
your
worst
when
you
seem
to
think
best
of
yourself
and
do
worry
about
losing
your
personality
as
you
persist
in
calling
it
at
fifteen
you
had
the
radiance
of
early
morning
at
twenty
you
will
begin
to
have
the
melancholy
brilliance
of
the
moon
and
when
you
are
my
age
you
will
give
out
as
i
do
the
genial
golden
warmth
of
if
you
write
me
letters
please
let
them
be
natural
ones
your
last
that
dissertation
on
architecture
was
perfectly
awful
so
highbrow
that
i
picture
you
living
in
an
intellectual
and
emotional
vacuum
and
beware
of
trying
to
classify
people
too
definitely
into
types
you
will
find
that
all
through
their
youth
they
will
persist
annoyingly
in
jumping
from
class
to
class
and
by
pasting
a
supercilious
label
on
every
one
you
meet
you
are
merely
packing
a
that
will
spring
up
and
leer
at
you
when
you
begin
to
come
into
really
antagonistic
contact
with
the
world
an
idealization
of
some
such
a
man
as
leonardo
da
vinci
would
be
a
more
valuable
beacon
to
you
at
present
you
are
bound
to
go
up
and
down
just
as
i
did
in
my
youth
but
do
keep
your
clarity
of
mind
and
if
fools
or
sages
dare
to
criticise
do
blame
yourself
too
much
you
say
that
convention
is
all
that
really
keeps
you
straight
in
this
woman
proposition
but
it
more
than
that
amory
the
fear
that
what
you
begin
you
ca
stop
you
would
run
amuck
and
i
know
whereof
i
speak
it
that
sixth
sense
by
which
you
detect
evil
it
the
fear
of
god
in
your
heart
whatever
your
metier
proves
to
be
religion
architecture
literature
i
sure
you
would
be
much
safer
anchored
to
the
church
but
i
wo
risk
my
influence
by
arguing
with
you
even
though
i
am
secretly
sure
that
the
black
chasm
of
romanism
yawns
beneath
you
do
write
me
soon
with
affectionate
regards
thayer
darcy
even
amory
reading
paled
during
this
period
he
delved
further
into
the
misty
side
streets
of
literature
huysmans
walter
pater
theophile
gautier
and
the
racier
sections
of
rabelais
boccaccio
petronius
and
suetonius
one
week
through
general
curiosity
he
inspected
the
private
libraries
of
his
classmates
and
found
sloane
as
typical
as
any
sets
of
kipling
henry
john
fox
and
richard
harding
davis
what
every
woman
ought
to
know
the
spell
of
the
yukon
a
gift
copy
of
james
whitcomb
riley
an
assortment
of
battered
annotated
schoolbooks
and
finally
to
his
surprise
one
of
his
own
late
discoveries
the
collected
poems
of
rupert
brooke
together
with
tom
he
sought
among
the
lights
of
princeton
for
some
one
who
might
found
the
great
american
poetic
tradition
the
undergraduate
body
itself
was
rather
more
interesting
that
year
than
had
been
the
entirely
philistine
princeton
of
two
years
before
things
had
livened
surprisingly
though
at
the
sacrifice
of
much
of
the
spontaneous
charm
of
freshman
year
in
the
old
princeton
they
would
never
have
discovered
tanaduke
wylie
tanaduke
was
a
sophomore
with
tremendous
ears
and
a
way
of
saying
the
earth
swirls
down
through
the
ominous
moons
of
preconsidered
generations
that
made
them
vaguely
wonder
why
it
did
not
sound
quite
clear
but
never
question
that
it
was
the
utterance
of
a
supersoul
at
least
so
tom
and
amory
took
him
they
told
him
in
all
earnestness
that
he
had
a
mind
like
shelley
and
featured
his
ultrafree
free
verse
and
prose
poetry
in
the
nassau
literary
magazine
but
tanaduke
genius
absorbed
the
many
colors
of
the
age
and
he
took
to
the
bohemian
life
to
their
great
disappointment
he
talked
of
greenwich
village
now
instead
of
moons
and
met
winter
muses
unacademic
and
cloistered
by
street
and
broadway
instead
of
the
shelleyan
with
whom
he
had
regaled
their
expectant
appreciation
so
they
surrendered
tanaduke
to
the
futurists
deciding
that
he
and
his
flaming
ties
would
do
better
there
tom
gave
him
the
final
advice
that
he
should
stop
writing
for
two
years
and
read
the
complete
works
of
alexander
pope
four
times
but
on
amory
suggestion
that
pope
for
tanaduke
was
like
for
stomach
trouble
they
withdrew
in
laughter
and
called
it
a
coin
toss
whether
this
genius
was
too
big
or
too
petty
for
them
amory
rather
scornfully
avoided
the
popular
professors
who
dispensed
easy
epigrams
and
thimblefuls
of
chartreuse
to
groups
of
admirers
every
night
he
was
disappointed
too
at
the
air
of
general
uncertainty
on
every
subject
that
seemed
linked
with
the
pedantic
temperament
his
opinions
took
shape
in
a
miniature
satire
called
in
a
which
he
persuaded
tom
to
print
in
the
nassau
lit
fool
three
times
a
week
you
hold
us
helpless
while
you
speak
teasing
our
thirsty
souls
with
the
sleek
of
your
philosophy
well
here
we
are
your
hundred
sheep
tune
up
play
on
pour
forth
we
sleep
you
are
a
student
so
they
say
you
hammered
out
the
other
day
a
syllabus
from
what
we
know
of
some
forgotten
folio
you
sniffled
through
an
era
must
filling
your
nostrils
up
with
dust
and
then
arising
from
your
knees
published
in
one
gigantic
sneeze
but
here
a
neighbor
on
my
right
an
eager
ass
considered
bright
asker
of
questions
how
he
stand
with
earnest
air
and
fidgy
hand
after
this
hour
telling
you
he
sat
all
night
and
burrowed
through
your
book
oh
you
be
coy
and
he
will
simulate
precosity
and
pedants
both
you
smile
and
smirk
and
leer
and
hasten
back
to
work
was
this
day
week
sir
you
returned
a
theme
of
mine
from
which
i
learned
through
various
comment
on
the
side
which
you
had
scrawled
that
i
defied
the
rules
of
for
and
witticism
you
quite
sure
that
this
could
be
and
is
no
authority
but
eager
ass
with
what
he
sent
plays
havoc
with
your
best
per
cent
still
still
i
meet
you
here
and
there
when
shakespeare
played
you
hold
a
chair
and
some
defunct
star
enchants
the
mental
prig
you
are
a
radical
comes
down
and
shocks
the
atheistic
orthodox
you
representing
common
sense
mouth
open
in
the
audience
and
sometimes
even
chapel
lures
that
conscious
tolerance
of
yours
that
broad
and
beaming
view
of
truth
including
kant
and
general
booth
and
so
from
shock
to
shock
you
live
a
hollow
pale
affirmative
the
hour
up
and
roused
from
rest
one
hundred
children
of
the
blest
cheat
you
a
word
or
two
with
feet
that
down
the
noisy
beat
forget
on
the
mighty
yawn
that
gave
you
in
april
kerry
holiday
left
college
and
sailed
for
france
to
enroll
in
the
lafayette
esquadrille
amory
envy
and
admiration
of
this
step
was
drowned
in
an
experience
of
his
own
to
which
he
never
succeeded
in
giving
an
appropriate
value
but
which
nevertheless
haunted
him
for
three
years
afterward
the
devil
healy
they
left
at
twelve
and
taxied
to
bistolary
there
were
axia
marlowe
and
phoebe
column
from
the
summer
garden
show
fred
sloane
and
amory
the
evening
was
so
very
young
that
they
felt
ridiculous
with
surplus
energy
and
burst
into
the
cafe
like
dionysian
revellers
table
for
four
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
yelled
phoebe
hurry
old
dear
tell
we
here
tell
to
play
shouted
sloane
you
two
order
phoebe
and
i
are
going
to
shake
a
wicked
calf
and
they
sailed
off
in
the
muddled
crowd
axia
and
amory
acquaintances
of
an
hour
jostled
behind
a
waiter
to
a
table
at
a
point
of
vantage
there
they
took
seats
and
watched
there
findle
margotson
from
new
haven
she
cried
above
the
uproar
findle
oh
axia
he
shouted
in
salutation
over
to
our
no
amory
whispered
ca
do
it
findle
i
with
somebody
else
call
me
up
about
one
findle
a
nondescript
answered
incoherently
and
turned
back
to
the
brilliant
blonde
whom
he
was
endeavoring
to
steer
around
the
room
there
a
natural
damn
fool
commented
amory
oh
he
all
right
here
the
old
jitney
waiter
if
you
ask
me
i
want
a
double
make
it
the
crowd
whirled
and
changed
and
shifted
they
were
mostly
from
the
colleges
with
a
scattering
of
the
male
refuse
of
broadway
and
women
of
two
types
the
higher
of
which
was
the
chorus
girl
on
the
whole
it
was
a
typical
crowd
and
their
party
as
typical
as
any
about
of
the
whole
business
was
for
effect
and
therefore
harmless
ended
at
the
door
of
the
cafe
soon
enough
for
the
train
back
to
yale
or
princeton
about
continued
on
into
the
dimmer
hours
and
gathered
strange
dust
from
strange
places
their
party
was
scheduled
to
be
one
of
the
harmless
kind
fred
sloane
and
phoebe
column
were
old
friends
axia
and
amory
new
ones
but
strange
things
are
prepared
even
in
the
dead
of
night
and
the
unusual
which
lurks
least
in
the
cafe
home
of
the
prosaic
and
inevitable
was
preparing
to
spoil
for
him
the
waning
romance
of
broadway
the
way
it
took
was
so
inexpressibly
terrible
so
unbelievable
that
afterward
he
never
thought
of
it
as
experience
but
it
was
a
scene
from
a
misty
tragedy
played
far
behind
the
veil
and
that
it
meant
something
definite
he
knew
about
one
they
moved
to
maxim
and
two
found
them
in
deviniere
sloane
had
been
drinking
consecutively
and
was
in
a
state
of
unsteady
exhilaration
but
amory
was
quite
tiresomely
sober
they
had
run
across
none
of
those
ancient
corrupt
buyers
of
champagne
who
usually
assisted
their
new
york
parties
they
were
just
through
dancing
and
were
making
their
way
back
to
their
chairs
when
amory
became
aware
that
some
one
at
a
table
was
looking
at
him
he
turned
and
glanced
casually
a
man
dressed
in
a
brown
sack
suit
it
was
sitting
a
little
apart
at
a
table
by
himself
and
watching
their
party
intently
at
amory
glance
he
smiled
faintly
amory
turned
to
fred
who
was
just
sitting
down
who
that
pale
fool
watching
us
he
complained
indignantly
where
cried
sloane
we
have
him
thrown
out
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
swayed
back
and
forth
clinging
to
his
chair
where
is
he
axia
and
phoebe
suddenly
leaned
and
whispered
to
each
other
across
the
table
and
before
amory
realized
it
they
found
themselves
on
their
way
to
the
door
where
now
up
to
the
flat
suggested
phoebe
we
got
brandy
and
fizz
and
everything
slow
down
here
amory
considered
quickly
he
had
been
drinking
and
decided
that
if
he
took
no
more
it
would
be
reasonably
discreet
for
him
to
trot
along
in
the
party
in
fact
it
would
be
perhaps
the
thing
to
do
in
order
to
keep
an
eye
on
sloane
who
was
not
in
a
state
to
do
his
own
thinking
so
he
took
axia
arm
and
piling
intimately
into
a
taxicab
they
drove
out
over
the
hundreds
and
drew
up
at
a
tall
never
would
he
forget
that
street
it
was
a
broad
street
lined
on
both
sides
with
just
such
tall
buildings
dotted
with
dark
windows
they
stretched
along
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
flooded
with
a
bright
moonlight
that
gave
them
a
calcium
pallor
he
imagined
each
one
to
have
an
elevator
and
a
colored
and
a
each
one
to
be
eight
stories
high
and
full
of
three
and
four
room
suites
he
was
rather
glad
to
walk
into
the
cheeriness
of
phoebe
and
sink
onto
a
sofa
while
the
girls
went
rummaging
for
food
phoebe
great
stuff
confided
sloane
sotto
voce
i
only
going
to
stay
half
an
hour
amory
said
sternly
he
wondered
if
it
sounded
priggish
hell
y
say
protested
sloane
we
here
now
do
le
i
do
like
this
place
amory
said
sulkily
and
i
do
want

phoebe
reappeared
with
sandwiches
brandy
bottle
siphon
and
four
glasses
amory
pour
out
she
said
and
we
drink
to
fred
sloane
who
has
a
rare
distinguished
yes
said
axia
coming
in
and
amory
i
like
she
sat
down
beside
him
and
laid
her
yellow
head
on
his
shoulder
i
pour
said
sloane
you
use
siphon
they
filled
the
tray
with
glasses
ready
here
she
goes
amory
hesitated
glass
in
hand
there
was
a
minute
while
temptation
crept
over
him
like
a
warm
wind
and
his
imagination
turned
to
fire
and
he
took
the
glass
from
hand
that
was
all
for
at
the
second
that
his
decision
came
he
looked
up
and
saw
ten
yards
from
him
the
man
who
had
been
in
the
cafe
and
with
his
jump
of
astonishment
the
glass
fell
from
his
uplifted
hand
there
the
man
half
sat
half
leaned
against
a
pile
of
pillows
on
the
corner
divan
his
face
was
cast
in
the
same
yellow
wax
as
in
the
cafe
neither
the
dull
pasty
color
of
a
dead
man
rather
a
sort
of
virile
pallor
nor
unhealthy
you
have
called
it
but
like
a
strong
man
worked
in
a
mine
or
done
night
shifts
in
a
damp
climate
amory
looked
him
over
carefully
and
later
he
could
have
drawn
him
after
a
fashion
down
to
the
merest
details
his
mouth
was
the
kind
that
is
called
frank
and
he
had
steady
gray
eyes
that
moved
slowly
from
one
to
the
other
of
their
group
with
just
the
shade
of
a
questioning
expression
amory
noticed
his
hands
they
were
fine
at
all
but
they
had
versatility
and
a
tenuous
strength
they
were
nervous
hands
that
sat
lightly
along
the
cushions
and
moved
constantly
with
little
jerky
openings
and
closings
then
suddenly
amory
perceived
the
feet
and
with
a
rush
of
blood
to
the
head
he
realized
he
was
afraid
the
feet
were
all
wrong
with
a
sort
of
wrongness
that
he
felt
rather
than
knew
it
was
like
weakness
in
a
good
woman
or
blood
on
satin
one
of
those
terrible
incongruities
that
shake
little
things
in
the
back
of
the
brain
he
wore
no
shoes
but
instead
a
sort
of
half
moccasin
pointed
though
like
the
shoes
they
wore
in
the
fourteenth
century
and
with
the
little
ends
curling
up
they
were
a
darkish
brown
and
his
toes
seemed
to
fill
them
to
the
end
they
were
unutterably
terrible
he
must
have
said
something
or
looked
something
for
axia
voice
came
out
of
the
void
with
a
strange
goodness
well
look
at
amory
poor
old
amory
sick
old
head
going
look
at
that
man
cried
amory
pointing
toward
the
corner
divan
you
mean
that
purple
zebra
shrieked
axia
facetiously
amory
got
a
purple
zebra
watching
him
sloane
laughed
vacantly
ole
zebra
gotcha
amory
there
was
a
silence
the
man
regarded
amory
quizzically
then
the
human
voices
fell
faintly
on
his
ear
thought
you
were
drinking
remarked
axia
sardonically
but
her
voice
was
good
to
hear
the
whole
divan
that
held
the
man
was
alive
alive
like
heat
waves
over
asphalt
like
wriggling
worms
come
back
come
back
axia
arm
fell
on
his
amory
dear
you
going
amory
he
was
to
the
door
come
on
amory
stick
us
sick
are
you
sit
down
a
second
take
some
take
a
little
brandy
the
elevator
was
close
and
the
colored
boy
was
half
asleep
paled
to
a
livid
bronze
axia
beseeching
voice
floated
down
the
shaft
those
feet
those
feet
as
they
settled
to
the
lower
floor
the
feet
came
into
view
in
the
sickly
electric
light
of
the
paved
hall
in
the
alley
down
the
long
street
came
the
moon
and
amory
turned
his
back
on
it
and
walked
ten
fifteen
steps
away
sounded
the
footsteps
they
were
like
a
slow
dripping
with
just
the
slightest
insistence
in
their
fall
amory
shadow
lay
perhaps
ten
feet
ahead
of
him
and
soft
shoes
was
presumably
that
far
behind
with
the
instinct
of
a
child
amory
edged
in
under
the
blue
darkness
of
the
white
buildings
cleaving
the
moonlight
for
haggard
seconds
once
bursting
into
a
slow
run
with
clumsy
stumblings
after
that
he
stopped
suddenly
he
must
keep
hold
he
thought
his
lips
were
dry
and
he
licked
them
if
he
met
any
one
good
were
there
any
good
people
left
in
the
world
or
did
they
all
live
in
white
now
was
every
one
followed
in
the
moonlight
but
if
he
met
some
one
good
who
know
what
he
meant
and
hear
this
damned
scuffle
then
the
scuffling
grew
suddenly
nearer
and
a
black
cloud
settled
over
the
moon
when
again
the
pale
sheen
skimmed
the
cornices
it
was
almost
beside
him
and
amory
thought
he
heard
a
quiet
breathing
suddenly
he
realized
that
the
footsteps
were
not
behind
had
never
been
behind
they
were
ahead
and
he
was
not
eluding
but
following
following
he
began
to
run
blindly
his
heart
knocking
heavily
his
hands
clinched
far
ahead
a
black
dot
showed
itself
resolved
slowly
into
a
human
shape
but
amory
was
beyond
that
now
he
turned
off
the
street
and
darted
into
an
alley
narrow
and
dark
and
smelling
of
old
rottenness
he
twisted
down
a
long
sinuous
blackness
where
the
moonlight
was
shut
away
except
for
tiny
glints
and
patches
then
suddenly
sank
panting
into
a
corner
by
a
fence
exhausted
the
steps
ahead
stopped
and
he
could
hear
them
shift
slightly
with
a
continuous
motion
like
waves
around
a
dock
he
put
his
face
in
his
hands
and
covered
eyes
and
ears
as
well
as
he
could
during
all
this
time
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
he
was
delirious
or
drunk
he
had
a
sense
of
reality
such
as
material
things
could
never
give
him
his
intellectual
content
seemed
to
submit
passively
to
it
and
it
fitted
like
a
glove
everything
that
had
ever
preceded
it
in
his
life
it
did
not
muddle
him
it
was
like
a
problem
whose
answer
he
knew
on
paper
yet
whose
solution
he
was
unable
to
grasp
he
was
far
beyond
horror
he
had
sunk
through
the
thin
surface
of
that
now
moved
in
a
region
where
the
feet
and
the
fear
of
white
walls
were
real
living
things
things
he
must
accept
only
far
inside
his
soul
a
little
fire
leaped
and
cried
that
something
was
pulling
him
down
trying
to
get
him
inside
a
door
and
slam
it
behind
him
after
that
door
was
slammed
there
would
be
only
footfalls
and
white
buildings
in
the
moonlight
and
perhaps
he
would
be
one
of
the
footfalls
during
the
five
or
ten
minutes
he
waited
in
the
shadow
of
the
fence
there
was
somehow
this
fire
that
was
as
near
as
he
could
name
it
afterward
he
remembered
calling
aloud
i
want
some
one
stupid
oh
send
some
one
stupid
this
to
the
black
fence
opposite
him
in
whose
shadows
the
footsteps
shuffled
shuffled
he
supposed
stupid
and
good
had
become
somehow
intermingled
through
previous
association
when
he
called
thus
it
was
not
an
act
of
will
at
all
will
had
turned
him
away
from
the
moving
figure
in
the
street
it
was
almost
instinct
that
called
just
the
pile
on
pile
of
inherent
tradition
or
some
wild
prayer
from
way
over
the
night
then
something
clanged
like
a
low
gong
struck
at
a
distance
and
before
his
eyes
a
face
flashed
over
the
two
feet
a
face
pale
and
distorted
with
a
sort
of
infinite
evil
that
twisted
it
like
flame
in
the
wind
he
knew
for
the
half
instant
that
the
gong
tanged
and
hummed
that
it
was
the
face
of
dick
minutes
later
he
sprang
to
his
feet
realizing
dimly
that
there
was
no
more
sound
and
that
he
was
alone
in
the
graying
alley
it
was
cold
and
he
started
on
a
steady
run
for
the
light
that
showed
the
street
at
the
other
end
at
the
window
it
was
late
morning
when
he
woke
and
found
the
telephone
beside
his
bed
in
the
hotel
tolling
frantically
and
remembered
that
he
had
left
word
to
be
called
at
eleven
sloane
was
snoring
heavily
his
clothes
in
a
pile
by
his
bed
they
dressed
and
ate
breakfast
in
silence
and
then
sauntered
out
to
get
some
air
amory
mind
was
working
slowly
trying
to
assimilate
what
had
happened
and
separate
from
the
chaotic
imagery
that
stacked
his
memory
the
bare
shreds
of
truth
if
the
morning
had
been
cold
and
gray
he
could
have
grasped
the
reins
of
the
past
in
an
instant
but
it
was
one
of
those
days
that
new
york
gets
sometimes
in
may
when
the
air
on
fifth
avenue
is
a
soft
light
wine
how
much
or
how
little
sloane
remembered
amory
did
not
care
to
know
he
apparently
had
none
of
the
nervous
tension
that
was
gripping
amory
and
forcing
his
mind
back
and
forth
like
a
shrieking
saw
then
broadway
broke
upon
them
and
with
the
babel
of
noise
and
the
painted
faces
a
sudden
sickness
rushed
over
amory
for
god
sake
let
go
back
let
get
off
of
this
this
place
sloane
looked
at
him
in
amazement
what
do
you
mean
this
street
it
ghastly
come
on
let
get
back
to
the
avenue
do
you
mean
to
say
said
sloane
stolidly
that
you
had
some
sort
of
indigestion
that
made
you
act
like
a
maniac
last
night
never
coming
on
broadway
again
simultaneously
amory
classed
him
with
the
crowd
and
he
seemed
no
longer
sloane
of
the
debonair
humor
and
the
happy
personality
but
only
one
of
the
evil
faces
that
whirled
along
the
turbid
stream
man
he
shouted
so
loud
that
the
people
on
the
corner
turned
and
followed
them
with
their
eyes
it
filthy
and
if
you
ca
see
it
you
filthy
too
i
ca
help
it
said
sloane
doggedly
what
the
matter
with
you
old
remorse
getting
you
you
be
in
a
fine
state
if
you
gone
through
with
our
little
i
going
fred
said
amory
slowly
his
knees
were
shaking
under
him
and
he
knew
that
if
he
stayed
another
minute
on
this
street
he
would
keel
over
where
he
stood
i
be
at
the
vanderbilt
for
and
he
strode
rapidly
off
and
turned
over
to
fifth
avenue
back
at
the
hotel
he
felt
better
but
as
he
walked
into
the
intending
to
get
a
head
massage
the
smell
of
the
powders
and
tonics
brought
back
sidelong
suggestive
smile
and
he
left
hurriedly
in
the
doorway
of
his
room
a
sudden
blackness
flowed
around
him
like
a
divided
river
when
he
came
to
himself
he
knew
that
several
hours
had
passed
he
pitched
onto
the
bed
and
rolled
over
on
his
face
with
a
deadly
fear
that
he
was
going
mad
he
wanted
people
people
some
one
sane
and
stupid
and
good
he
lay
for
he
knew
not
how
long
without
moving
he
could
feel
the
little
hot
veins
on
his
forehead
standing
out
and
his
terror
had
hardened
on
him
like
plaster
he
felt
he
was
passing
up
again
through
the
thin
crust
of
horror
and
now
only
could
he
distinguish
the
shadowy
twilight
he
was
leaving
he
must
have
fallen
asleep
again
for
when
he
next
recollected
himself
he
had
paid
the
hotel
bill
and
was
stepping
into
a
taxi
at
the
door
it
was
raining
torrents
on
the
train
for
princeton
he
saw
no
one
he
knew
only
a
crowd
of
philadelphians
the
presence
of
a
painted
woman
across
the
aisle
filled
him
with
a
fresh
burst
of
sickness
and
he
changed
to
another
car
tried
to
concentrate
on
an
article
in
a
popular
magazine
he
found
himself
reading
the
same
paragraphs
over
and
over
so
he
abandoned
this
attempt
and
leaning
over
wearily
pressed
his
hot
forehead
against
the
damp
the
car
a
smoker
was
hot
and
stuffy
with
most
of
the
smells
of
the
state
alien
population
he
opened
a
window
and
shivered
against
the
cloud
of
fog
that
drifted
in
over
him
the
two
hours
ride
were
like
days
and
he
nearly
cried
aloud
with
joy
when
the
towers
of
princeton
loomed
up
beside
him
and
the
yellow
squares
of
light
filtered
through
the
blue
rain
tom
was
standing
in
the
centre
of
the
room
pensively
relighting
a
amory
fancied
he
looked
rather
relieved
on
seeing
him
had
a
hell
of
a
dream
about
you
last
night
came
in
the
cracked
voice
through
the
cigar
smoke
i
had
an
idea
you
were
in
some
do
tell
me
about
it
amory
almost
shrieked
do
say
a
word
tired
and
pepped
tom
looked
at
him
queerly
and
then
sank
into
a
chair
and
opened
his
italian
amory
threw
his
coat
and
hat
on
the
floor
loosened
his
collar
and
took
a
wells
novel
at
random
from
the
shelf
wells
is
sane
he
thought
and
if
he
wo
do
i
read
rupert
half
an
hour
passed
outside
the
wind
came
up
and
amory
started
as
the
wet
branches
moved
and
clawed
with
their
at
the
tom
was
deep
in
his
work
and
inside
the
room
only
the
occasional
scratch
of
a
match
or
the
rustle
of
leather
as
they
shifted
in
their
chairs
broke
the
stillness
then
like
a
zigzag
of
lightning
came
the
change
amory
sat
bolt
upright
frozen
cold
in
his
chair
tom
was
looking
at
him
with
his
mouth
drooping
eyes
fixed
god
help
us
amory
cried
oh
my
heavens
shouted
tom
look
behind
quick
as
a
flash
amory
whirled
around
he
saw
nothing
but
the
dark
it
gone
now
came
tom
voice
after
a
second
in
a
still
terror
something
was
looking
at
trembling
violently
amory
dropped
into
his
chair
again
i
got
to
tell
you
he
said
i
had
one
hell
of
an
experience
i
think
i
i
seen
the
devil
or
something
like
him
what
face
did
you
just
see
or
no
he
added
quickly
do
tell
me
and
he
gave
tom
the
story
it
was
midnight
when
he
finished
and
after
that
with
all
lights
burning
two
sleepy
shivering
boys
read
to
each
other
from
the
new
machiavelli
until
dawn
came
up
out
of
witherspoon
hall
and
the
princetonian
fell
against
the
door
and
the
may
birds
hailed
the
sun
on
last
night
rain
chapter
narcissus
off
duty
during
princeton
transition
period
that
is
during
amory
last
two
years
there
while
he
saw
it
change
and
broaden
and
live
up
to
its
gothic
beauty
by
better
means
than
night
parades
certain
individuals
arrived
who
stirred
it
to
its
plethoric
depths
some
of
them
had
been
freshmen
and
wild
freshmen
with
amory
some
were
in
the
class
below
and
it
was
in
the
beginning
of
his
last
year
and
around
small
tables
at
the
nassau
inn
that
they
began
questioning
aloud
the
institutions
that
amory
and
countless
others
before
him
had
questioned
so
long
in
secret
first
and
partly
by
accident
they
struck
on
certain
books
a
definite
type
of
biographical
novel
that
amory
christened
quest
books
in
the
quest
book
the
hero
set
off
in
life
armed
with
the
best
weapons
and
avowedly
intending
to
use
them
as
such
weapons
are
usually
used
to
push
their
possessors
ahead
as
selfishly
and
blindly
as
possible
but
the
heroes
of
the
quest
books
discovered
that
there
might
be
a
more
magnificent
use
for
them
none
other
gods
sinister
street
and
the
research
magnificent
were
examples
of
such
books
it
was
the
latter
of
these
three
that
gripped
burne
holiday
and
made
him
wonder
in
the
beginning
of
senior
year
how
much
it
was
worth
while
being
a
diplomatic
autocrat
around
his
club
on
prospect
avenue
and
basking
in
the
high
lights
of
class
office
it
was
distinctly
through
the
channels
of
aristocracy
that
burne
found
his
way
amory
through
kerry
had
had
a
vague
drifting
acquaintance
with
him
but
not
until
january
of
senior
year
did
their
friendship
commence
heard
the
latest
said
tom
coming
in
late
one
drizzly
evening
with
that
triumphant
air
he
always
wore
after
a
successful
conversational
bout
no
somebody
flunked
out
or
another
ship
sunk
worse
than
that
about
of
the
junior
class
are
going
to
resign
from
their
what
actual
fact
why
spirit
of
reform
and
all
that
burne
holiday
is
behind
it
the
club
presidents
are
holding
a
meeting
to
see
if
they
can
find
a
joint
means
of
combating
well
what
the
idea
of
the
thing
oh
clubs
injurious
to
princeton
democracy
cost
a
lot
draw
social
lines
take
time
the
regular
line
you
get
sometimes
from
disappointed
sophomores
woodrow
thought
they
should
be
abolished
and
all
but
this
is
the
real
thing
absolutely
i
think
it
go
for
pete
sake
tell
me
more
about
well
began
tom
it
seems
that
the
idea
developed
simultaneously
in
several
heads
i
was
talking
to
burne
awhile
ago
and
he
claims
that
it
a
logical
result
if
an
intelligent
person
thinks
long
enough
about
the
social
system
they
had
a
crowd
and
the
point
of
abolishing
the
clubs
was
brought
up
by
some
one
everybody
there
leaped
at
it
it
had
been
in
each
one
mind
more
or
less
and
it
just
needed
a
spark
to
bring
it
fine
i
swear
i
think
it
be
most
entertaining
how
do
they
feel
up
at
cap
and
gown
wild
of
course
every
one
been
sitting
and
arguing
and
swearing
and
getting
mad
and
getting
sentimental
and
getting
brutal
it
the
same
at
all
the
clubs
i
been
the
rounds
they
get
one
of
the
radicals
in
the
corner
and
fire
questions
at
how
do
the
radicals
stand
up
oh
moderately
well
burne
a
damn
good
talker
and
so
obviously
sincere
that
you
ca
get
anywhere
with
him
it
so
evident
that
resigning
from
his
club
means
so
much
more
to
him
than
preventing
it
does
to
us
that
i
felt
futile
when
i
argued
finally
took
a
position
that
was
brilliantly
neutral
in
fact
i
believe
burne
thought
for
a
while
that
he
converted
and
you
say
almost
a
third
of
the
junior
class
are
going
to
resign
call
it
a
fourth
and
be
lord
who
have
thought
it
possible
there
was
a
brisk
knock
at
the
door
and
burne
himself
came
in
hello
amory
hello
amory
rose
burne
do
mind
if
i
seem
to
rush
i
going
to
burne
turned
to
him
quickly
you
probably
know
what
i
want
to
talk
to
tom
about
and
it
is
a
bit
private
i
wish
you
i
be
glad
amory
sat
down
again
and
as
burne
perched
on
a
table
and
launched
into
argument
with
tom
he
looked
at
this
revolutionary
more
carefully
than
he
ever
had
before
and
with
a
fineness
in
the
honest
gray
eyes
that
were
like
kerry
burne
was
a
man
who
gave
an
immediate
impression
of
bigness
and
security
stubborn
that
was
evident
but
his
stubbornness
wore
no
stolidity
and
when
he
had
talked
for
five
minutes
amory
knew
that
this
keen
enthusiasm
had
in
it
no
quality
of
dilettantism
the
intense
power
amory
felt
later
in
burne
holiday
differed
from
the
admiration
he
had
had
for
humbird
this
time
it
began
as
purely
a
mental
interest
with
other
men
of
whom
he
had
thought
as
primarily
he
had
been
attracted
first
by
their
personalities
and
in
burne
he
missed
that
immediate
magnetism
to
which
he
usually
swore
allegiance
but
that
night
amory
was
struck
by
burne
intense
earnestness
a
quality
he
was
accustomed
to
associate
only
with
the
dread
stupidity
and
by
the
great
enthusiasm
that
struck
dead
chords
in
his
heart
burne
stood
vaguely
for
a
land
amory
hoped
he
was
drifting
toward
and
it
was
almost
time
that
land
was
in
sight
tom
and
amory
and
alec
had
reached
an
impasse
never
did
they
seem
to
have
new
experiences
in
common
for
tom
and
alec
had
been
as
blindly
busy
with
their
committees
and
boards
as
amory
had
been
blindly
idling
and
the
things
they
had
for
dissection
college
contemporary
personality
and
the
like
they
had
hashed
and
rehashed
for
many
a
frugal
conversational
meal
that
night
they
discussed
the
clubs
until
twelve
and
in
the
main
they
agreed
with
burne
to
the
roommates
it
did
not
seem
such
a
vital
subject
as
it
had
in
the
two
years
before
but
the
logic
of
burne
objections
to
the
social
system
dovetailed
so
completely
with
everything
they
had
thought
that
they
questioned
rather
than
argued
and
envied
the
sanity
that
enabled
this
man
to
stand
out
so
against
all
traditions
then
amory
branched
off
and
found
that
burne
was
deep
in
other
things
as
well
economics
had
interested
him
and
he
was
turning
socialist
pacifism
played
in
the
back
of
his
mind
and
he
read
the
masses
and
lyoff
tolstoi
faithfully
how
about
religion
amory
asked
him
do
know
i
in
a
muddle
about
a
lot
of
things
i
just
discovered
that
i
a
mind
and
i
starting
to
read
what
everything
i
have
to
pick
and
choose
of
course
but
mostly
things
to
make
me
think
i
reading
the
four
gospels
now
and
the
of
religious
experience
what
chiefly
started
you
wells
i
guess
and
tolstoi
and
a
man
named
edward
carpenter
been
reading
for
over
a
year
now
on
a
few
lines
on
what
i
consider
the
essential
poetry
well
frankly
not
what
you
call
poetry
or
for
your
reasons
you
two
write
of
course
and
look
at
things
differently
whitman
is
the
man
that
attracts
whitman
yes
he
a
definite
ethical
well
i
ashamed
to
say
that
i
a
blank
on
the
subject
of
whitman
how
about
you
tom
tom
nodded
sheepishly
well
continued
burne
you
may
strike
a
few
poems
that
are
tiresome
but
i
mean
the
mass
of
his
work
he
tremendous
like
tolstoi
they
both
look
things
in
the
face
and
somehow
different
as
they
are
stand
for
somewhat
the
same
you
have
me
stumped
burne
amory
admitted
i
read
and
the
sonata
of
course
but
tolstoi
is
mostly
in
the
original
russian
as
far
as
i
he
the
greatest
man
in
hundreds
of
years
cried
burne
enthusiastically
did
you
ever
see
a
picture
of
that
shaggy
old
head
of
his
they
talked
until
three
from
biology
to
organized
religion
and
when
amory
crept
shivering
into
bed
it
was
with
his
mind
aglow
with
ideas
and
a
sense
of
shock
that
some
one
else
had
discovered
the
path
he
might
have
followed
burne
holiday
was
so
evidently
developing
and
amory
had
considered
that
he
was
doing
the
same
he
had
fallen
into
a
deep
cynicism
over
what
had
crossed
his
path
plotted
the
imperfectability
of
man
and
read
shaw
and
chesterton
enough
to
keep
his
mind
from
the
edges
of
decadence
now
suddenly
all
his
mental
processes
of
the
last
year
and
a
half
seemed
stale
and
futile
a
petty
consummation
of
himself
and
like
a
sombre
background
lay
that
incident
of
the
spring
before
that
filled
half
his
nights
with
a
dreary
terror
and
made
him
unable
to
pray
he
was
not
even
a
catholic
yet
that
was
the
only
ghost
of
a
code
that
he
had
the
gaudy
ritualistic
paradoxical
catholicism
whose
prophet
was
chesterton
whose
claqueurs
were
such
reformed
rakes
of
literature
as
huysmans
and
bourget
whose
american
sponsor
was
ralph
adams
cram
with
his
adulation
of
cathedrals
a
catholicism
which
amory
found
convenient
and
without
priest
or
sacraments
or
sacrifice
he
could
not
sleep
so
he
turned
on
his
and
taking
down
the
kreutzer
sonata
searched
it
carefully
for
the
germs
of
enthusiasm
being
burne
was
suddenly
so
much
realler
than
being
clever
yet
he
sighed
here
were
other
possible
clay
feet
he
thought
back
through
two
years
of
burne
as
a
hurried
nervous
freshman
quite
submerged
in
his
brother
personality
then
he
remembered
an
incident
of
sophomore
year
in
which
burne
had
been
suspected
of
the
leading
role
dean
hollister
had
been
heard
by
a
large
group
arguing
with
a
who
had
driven
him
from
the
junction
in
the
course
of
the
altercation
the
dean
remarked
that
he
might
as
well
buy
the
he
paid
and
walked
off
but
next
morning
he
entered
his
private
office
to
find
the
taxicab
itself
in
the
space
usually
occupied
by
his
desk
bearing
a
sign
which
read
property
of
dean
hollister
bought
and
paid
it
took
two
expert
mechanics
half
a
day
to
dissemble
it
into
its
minutest
parts
and
remove
it
which
only
goes
to
prove
the
rare
energy
of
sophomore
humor
under
efficient
leadership
then
again
that
very
fall
burne
had
caused
a
sensation
a
certain
phyllis
styles
an
intercollegiate
had
failed
to
get
her
yearly
invitation
to
the
game
jesse
ferrenby
had
brought
her
to
a
smaller
game
a
few
weeks
before
and
had
pressed
burne
into
service
to
the
ruination
of
the
misogyny
are
you
coming
to
the
harvard
game
burne
had
asked
indiscreetly
merely
to
make
conversation
if
you
ask
me
cried
phyllis
quickly
of
course
i
do
said
burne
feebly
he
was
unversed
in
the
arts
of
phyllis
and
was
sure
that
this
was
merely
a
vapid
form
of
kidding
before
an
hour
had
passed
he
knew
that
he
was
indeed
involved
phyllis
had
pinned
him
down
and
served
him
up
informed
him
the
train
she
was
arriving
by
and
depressed
him
thoroughly
aside
from
loathing
phyllis
he
had
particularly
wanted
to
stag
that
game
and
entertain
some
harvard
friends
she
see
he
informed
a
delegation
who
arrived
in
his
room
to
josh
him
this
will
be
the
last
game
she
ever
persuades
any
young
innocent
to
take
her
to
but
burne
why
did
you
her
if
you
did
want
her
burne
you
you
secretly
mad
about
her
that
the
what
can
do
burne
what
can
do
against
phyllis
but
burne
only
shook
his
head
and
muttered
threats
which
consisted
largely
of
the
phrase
she
see
she
see
the
blithesome
phyllis
bore
her
summers
gayly
from
the
train
but
on
the
platform
a
ghastly
sight
met
her
eyes
there
were
burne
and
fred
sloane
arrayed
to
the
last
dot
like
the
lurid
figures
on
college
posters
they
had
bought
flaring
suits
with
huge
trousers
and
gigantic
padded
shoulders
on
their
heads
were
rakish
college
hats
pinned
up
in
front
and
sporting
bright
bands
while
from
their
celluloid
collars
blossomed
flaming
orange
ties
they
wore
black
with
orange
p
and
carried
canes
flying
princeton
pennants
the
effect
completed
by
socks
and
peeping
handkerchiefs
in
the
same
color
motifs
on
a
clanking
chain
they
led
a
large
angry
painted
to
represent
a
tiger
a
good
half
of
the
station
crowd
was
already
staring
at
them
torn
between
horrified
pity
and
riotous
mirth
and
as
phyllis
with
her
svelte
jaw
dropping
approached
the
pair
bent
over
and
emitted
a
college
cheer
in
loud
voices
thoughtfully
adding
the
name
phyllis
to
the
end
she
was
vociferously
greeted
and
escorted
enthusiastically
across
the
campus
followed
by
half
a
hundred
village
urchins
to
the
stifled
laughter
of
hundreds
of
alumni
and
visitors
half
of
whom
had
no
idea
that
this
was
a
practical
joke
but
thought
that
burne
and
fred
were
two
varsity
sports
showing
their
girl
a
collegiate
time
phyllis
feelings
as
she
was
paraded
by
the
harvard
and
princeton
stands
where
sat
dozens
of
her
former
devotees
can
be
imagined
she
tried
to
walk
a
little
ahead
she
tried
to
walk
a
little
behind
but
they
stayed
close
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
whom
she
was
with
talking
in
loud
voices
of
their
friends
on
the
football
team
until
she
could
almost
hear
her
acquaintances
whispering
phyllis
styles
must
be
hard
to
have
to
come
with
that
had
been
burne
dynamically
humorous
fundamentally
serious
from
that
root
had
blossomed
the
energy
that
he
was
now
trying
to
orient
with
progress
so
the
weeks
passed
and
march
came
and
the
clay
feet
that
amory
looked
for
failed
to
appear
about
a
hundred
juniors
and
seniors
resigned
from
their
clubs
in
a
final
fury
of
righteousness
and
the
clubs
in
helplessness
turned
upon
burne
their
finest
weapon
ridicule
every
one
who
knew
him
liked
him
but
what
he
stood
for
and
he
began
to
stand
for
more
all
the
time
came
under
the
lash
of
many
tongues
until
a
frailer
man
than
he
would
have
been
snowed
under
do
you
mind
losing
prestige
asked
amory
one
night
they
had
taken
to
exchanging
calls
several
times
a
week
of
course
i
do
what
prestige
at
best
some
people
say
that
you
just
a
rather
original
he
roared
with
laughter
that
what
fred
sloane
told
me
i
suppose
i
have
it
one
afternoon
they
dipped
into
a
subject
that
had
interested
amory
for
a
long
time
the
matter
of
the
bearing
of
physical
attributes
on
a
burne
had
gone
into
the
biology
of
this
and
then
of
course
health
counts
a
healthy
man
has
twice
the
chance
of
being
good
he
said
i
do
agree
with
you
i
do
believe
in
christianity
i
do
i
believe
christ
had
great
physical
oh
no
amory
protested
he
worked
too
hard
for
that
i
imagine
that
when
he
died
he
was
a
man
and
the
great
saints
have
been
half
of
them
well
even
granting
that
i
do
think
health
has
anything
to
do
with
goodness
of
course
it
valuable
to
a
great
saint
to
be
able
to
stand
enormous
strains
but
this
fad
of
popular
preachers
rising
on
their
toes
in
simulated
virility
bellowing
that
calisthenics
will
save
the
world
no
burne
i
ca
go
well
let
waive
it
we
wo
get
anywhere
and
besides
i
quite
made
up
my
mind
about
it
myself
now
here
something
i
know
personal
appearance
has
a
lot
to
do
with
coloring
amory
asked
eagerly
that
what
tom
and
i
figured
amory
agreed
we
took
the
for
the
last
ten
years
and
looked
at
the
pictures
of
the
senior
council
i
know
you
do
think
much
of
that
august
body
but
it
does
represent
success
here
in
a
general
way
well
i
suppose
only
about
per
cent
of
every
class
here
are
blonds
are
really
light
yet
of
every
senior
council
are
light
we
looked
at
pictures
of
ten
years
of
them
mind
you
that
means
that
out
of
every
men
in
the
senior
class
is
on
the
senior
council
and
of
the
men
it
only
one
in
it
true
burne
agreed
the
man
a
higher
type
generally
speaking
i
worked
the
thing
out
with
the
presidents
of
the
united
states
once
and
found
that
way
over
half
of
them
were
yet
think
of
the
preponderant
number
of
brunettes
in
the
people
unconsciously
admit
it
said
amory
you
notice
a
blond
person
is
to
talk
if
a
blond
girl
does
talk
we
call
her
a
if
a
man
is
silent
he
considered
stupid
yet
the
world
is
full
of
silent
men
and
brunettes
who
have
a
brain
in
their
heads
but
somehow
are
never
accused
of
the
and
the
large
mouth
and
broad
chin
and
rather
big
nose
undoubtedly
make
the
superior
i
not
so
amory
was
all
for
classical
features
oh
yes
i
show
you
and
burne
pulled
out
of
his
desk
a
photographic
collection
of
heavily
bearded
shaggy
celebrities
tolstoi
whitman
carpenter
and
others
are
they
wonderful
amory
tried
politely
to
appreciate
them
and
gave
up
laughingly
burne
i
think
they
the
crowd
i
ever
came
across
they
look
like
an
old
man
oh
amory
look
at
that
forehead
on
emerson
look
at
tolstoi
his
tone
was
reproachful
amory
shook
his
head
no
call
them
or
anything
you
want
but
ugly
they
certainly
unabashed
burne
ran
his
hand
lovingly
across
the
spacious
foreheads
and
piling
up
the
pictures
put
them
back
in
his
desk
walking
at
night
was
one
of
his
favorite
pursuits
and
one
night
he
persuaded
amory
to
accompany
him
i
hate
the
dark
amory
objected
i
did
use
to
except
when
i
was
particularly
imaginative
but
now
i
really
do
i
a
regular
fool
about
that
useless
you
quite
we
go
east
burne
suggested
and
down
that
string
of
roads
through
the
does
sound
very
appealing
to
me
admitted
amory
reluctantly
but
let
they
set
off
at
a
good
gait
and
for
an
hour
swung
along
in
a
brisk
argument
until
the
lights
of
princeton
were
luminous
white
blots
behind
them
any
person
with
any
imagination
is
bound
to
be
afraid
said
burne
earnestly
and
this
very
walking
at
night
is
one
of
the
things
i
was
afraid
about
i
going
to
tell
you
why
i
can
walk
anywhere
now
and
not
be
go
on
amory
urged
eagerly
they
were
striding
toward
the
woods
burne
nervous
enthusiastic
voice
warming
to
his
subject
i
used
to
come
out
here
alone
at
night
oh
three
months
ago
and
i
always
stopped
at
that
we
just
passed
there
were
the
woods
looming
up
ahead
just
as
they
do
now
there
were
dogs
howling
and
the
shadows
and
no
human
sound
of
course
i
peopled
the
woods
with
everything
ghastly
just
like
you
do
do
you
i
do
amory
admitted
well
i
began
analyzing
it
my
imagination
persisted
in
sticking
horrors
into
the
dark
so
i
stuck
my
imagination
into
the
dark
instead
and
let
it
look
out
at
me
i
let
it
play
stray
dog
or
escaped
convict
or
ghost
and
then
saw
myself
coming
along
the
road
that
made
it
all
right
as
it
always
makes
everything
all
right
to
project
yourself
completely
into
another
place
i
knew
that
if
i
were
the
dog
or
the
convict
or
the
ghost
i
would
be
a
menace
to
burne
holiday
any
more
than
he
was
a
menace
to
me
then
i
thought
of
my
watch
i
better
go
back
and
leave
it
and
then
essay
the
woods
no
i
decided
better
on
the
whole
that
i
should
lose
a
watch
than
that
i
should
turn
back
and
i
did
go
into
them
not
only
followed
the
road
through
them
but
walked
into
them
until
i
was
frightened
any
more
did
it
until
one
night
i
sat
down
and
dozed
off
in
there
then
i
knew
i
was
through
being
afraid
of
the
lordy
amory
breathed
i
could
have
done
that
i
have
come
out
and
the
first
time
an
automobile
passed
and
made
the
dark
thicker
when
its
lamps
disappeared
i
have
come
well
burne
said
suddenly
after
a
few
moments
silence
through
let
turn
on
the
return
he
launched
into
a
discussion
of
will
it
the
whole
thing
he
asserted
it
the
one
dividing
line
between
good
and
evil
i
never
met
a
man
who
led
a
rotten
life
and
have
a
weak
how
about
great
criminals
they
usually
insane
if
not
they
weak
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
strong
sane
burne
i
disagree
with
you
altogether
how
about
the
superman
well
he
evil
i
think
yet
he
strong
and
i
never
met
him
i
bet
though
that
he
stupid
or
i
met
him
over
and
over
and
he
neither
that
why
i
think
i
sure
i
not
and
so
i
do
believe
in
imprisonment
except
for
the
on
this
point
amory
could
not
agree
it
seemed
to
him
that
life
and
history
were
rife
with
the
strong
criminal
keen
but
often
in
politics
and
business
one
found
him
and
among
the
old
statesmen
and
kings
and
generals
but
burne
never
agreed
and
their
courses
began
to
split
on
that
point
burne
was
drawing
farther
and
farther
away
from
the
world
about
him
he
resigned
the
of
the
senior
class
and
took
to
reading
and
walking
as
almost
his
only
pursuits
he
voluntarily
attended
graduate
lectures
in
philosophy
and
biology
and
sat
in
all
of
them
with
a
rather
pathetically
intent
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
waiting
for
something
the
lecturer
would
never
quite
come
to
sometimes
amory
would
see
him
squirm
in
his
seat
and
his
face
would
light
up
he
was
on
fire
to
debate
a
point
he
grew
more
abstracted
on
the
street
and
was
even
accused
of
becoming
a
snob
but
amory
knew
it
was
nothing
of
the
sort
and
once
when
burne
passed
him
four
feet
off
absolutely
unseeingly
his
mind
a
thousand
miles
away
amory
almost
choked
with
the
romantic
joy
of
watching
him
burne
seemed
to
be
climbing
heights
where
others
would
be
forever
unable
to
get
a
foothold
i
tell
you
amory
declared
to
tom
he
the
first
contemporary
ever
met
whom
i
admit
is
my
superior
in
mental
it
a
bad
time
to
admit
it
people
are
beginning
to
think
he
he
way
over
their
heads
you
know
you
think
so
yourself
when
you
talk
to
him
good
lord
tom
you
to
stand
out
against
success
has
completely
conventionalized
tom
grew
rather
annoyed
what
he
trying
to
do
be
excessively
holy
no
not
like
anybody
you
ever
seen
never
enters
the
philadelphian
society
he
has
no
faith
in
that
rot
he
does
believe
that
public
and
a
kind
word
in
time
will
right
the
wrongs
of
the
world
moreover
he
takes
a
drink
whenever
he
feels
like
he
certainly
is
getting
in
have
you
talked
to
him
lately
then
you
have
any
conception
of
the
argument
ended
nowhere
but
amory
noticed
more
than
ever
how
the
sentiment
toward
burne
had
changed
on
the
campus
it
odd
amory
said
to
tom
one
night
when
they
had
grown
more
amicable
on
the
subject
that
the
people
who
violently
disapprove
of
burne
radicalism
are
distinctly
the
pharisee
class
i
mean
they
the
men
in
college
the
editors
of
the
papers
like
yourself
and
ferrenby
the
younger
professors
the
illiterate
athletes
like
langueduc
think
he
getting
eccentric
but
they
just
say
old
burne
has
got
some
queer
ideas
in
his
head
and
pass
on
the
pharisee
class
gee
they
ridicule
him
the
next
morning
he
met
burne
hurrying
along
mccosh
walk
after
a
recitation
whither
bound
tsar
over
to
the
prince
office
to
see
ferrenby
he
waved
a
copy
of
the
morning
princetonian
at
amory
he
wrote
this
going
to
flay
him
alive
no
but
he
got
me
all
balled
up
either
i
misjudged
him
or
suddenly
become
the
world
worst
burne
hurried
on
and
it
was
several
days
before
amory
heard
an
account
of
the
ensuing
conversation
burne
had
come
into
the
editor
sanctum
displaying
the
paper
cheerfully
hello
hello
there
i
just
read
your
good
boy
did
know
you
stooped
that
jesse
you
startled
how
so
are
you
afraid
the
faculty
get
after
you
if
you
pull
this
irreligious
stuff
what
like
this
what
the
devil
that
editorial
was
on
the
coaching
yes
but
that
quotation
jesse
sat
up
what
quotation
you
know
who
is
not
with
me
is
against
me
well
what
about
it
jesse
was
puzzled
but
not
alarmed
well
you
say
here
let
me
burne
opened
the
paper
and
read
who
is
not
with
me
is
against
as
that
gentleman
said
who
was
notoriously
capable
of
only
coarse
distinctions
and
puerile
generalities
what
of
it
ferrenby
began
to
look
alarmed
oliver
cromwell
said
it
did
he
or
was
it
washington
or
one
of
the
saints
good
lord
burne
roared
with
laughter
oh
jesse
oh
good
kind
who
said
it
for
pete
sake
well
said
burne
recovering
his
voice
st
matthew
attributes
it
to
my
god
cried
jesse
and
collapsed
backward
into
the
amory
writes
a
poem
the
weeks
tore
by
amory
wandered
occasionally
to
new
york
on
the
chance
of
finding
a
new
shining
green
that
its
glamour
might
penetrate
his
disposition
one
day
he
ventured
into
a
revival
of
a
play
whose
name
was
faintly
familiar
the
curtain
rose
he
watched
casually
as
a
girl
entered
a
few
phrases
rang
in
his
ear
and
touched
a
faint
chord
of
memory
where
when
then
he
seemed
to
hear
a
voice
whispering
beside
him
a
very
soft
vibrant
voice
oh
i
such
a
poor
little
fool
tell
me
when
i
do
the
solution
came
in
a
flash
and
he
had
a
quick
glad
memory
of
isabelle
he
found
a
blank
space
on
his
programme
and
began
to
scribble
rapidly
here
in
the
figured
dark
i
watch
once
more
there
with
the
curtain
roll
the
years
away
two
years
of
years
there
was
an
idle
day
of
ours
when
happy
endings
did
bore
our
unfermented
souls
i
could
adore
your
eager
face
beside
me
gay
smiling
a
repertoire
while
the
poor
play
reached
me
as
a
faint
ripple
reaches
shore
yawning
and
wondering
an
evening
through
i
watch
alone
and
chatterings
of
course
spoil
the
one
scene
which
somehow
have
charms
you
wept
a
bit
and
i
grew
sad
for
you
right
here
where
x
defends
divorce
and
falls
fainting
in
his
still
calm
ghosts
are
such
dumb
things
said
alec
they
i
can
always
outguess
a
how
asked
tom
well
it
depends
where
take
a
bedroom
for
example
if
you
use
discretion
a
ghost
can
never
get
you
in
a
go
on
you
think
there
maybe
a
ghost
in
your
bedroom
what
measures
do
you
take
on
getting
home
at
night
demanded
amory
interested
take
a
stick
answered
alec
with
ponderous
reverence
one
about
the
length
of
a
now
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
get
the
room
to
do
this
you
rush
with
your
eyes
closed
into
your
study
and
turn
on
the
lights
next
approaching
the
closet
carefully
run
the
stick
in
the
door
three
or
four
times
then
if
nothing
happens
you
can
look
in
run
the
stick
in
viciously
first
look
first
of
course
that
the
ancient
celtic
school
said
tom
gravely
yes
but
they
usually
pray
first
anyway
you
use
this
method
to
clear
the
closets
and
also
for
behind
all
doors
and
the
bed
amory
suggested
oh
amory
no
cried
alec
in
horror
that
is
the
way
the
bed
requires
different
tactics
let
the
bed
alone
as
you
value
your
reason
if
there
is
a
ghost
in
the
room
and
that
only
about
a
third
of
the
time
it
is
under
the
well
amory
began
alec
waved
him
into
silence
of
you
never
look
you
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
before
he
knows
what
you
going
to
do
make
a
sudden
leap
for
the
bed
never
walk
near
the
bed
to
a
ghost
your
ankle
is
your
most
vulnerable
part
once
in
bed
you
safe
he
may
lie
around
under
the
bed
all
night
but
you
safe
as
daylight
if
you
still
have
doubts
pull
the
blanket
over
your
all
that
very
interesting
is
it
alec
beamed
proudly
all
my
own
too
the
sir
oliver
lodge
of
the
new
amory
was
enjoying
college
immensely
again
the
sense
of
going
forward
in
a
direct
determined
line
had
come
back
youth
was
stirring
and
shaking
out
a
few
new
feathers
he
had
even
stored
enough
surplus
energy
to
sally
into
a
new
pose
what
the
idea
of
all
this
stuff
amory
asked
alec
one
day
and
then
as
amory
pretended
to
be
cramped
over
his
book
in
a
daze
oh
do
try
to
act
burne
the
mystic
to
amory
looked
up
innocently
what
what
mimicked
alec
are
you
trying
to
read
yourself
into
a
rhapsody
with
let
see
the
he
snatched
it
regarded
it
derisively
well
said
amory
a
little
stiffly
life
of
teresa
read
alec
aloud
oh
my
gosh
say
what
does
it
bother
you
does
what
bother
me
my
acting
dazed
and
all
that
why
no
of
course
it
does
well
then
do
spoil
it
if
i
enjoy
going
around
telling
people
guilelessly
that
i
think
i
a
genius
let
me
do
you
getting
a
reputation
for
being
eccentric
said
alec
laughing
if
that
what
you
amory
finally
prevailed
and
alec
agreed
to
accept
his
face
value
in
the
presence
of
others
if
he
was
allowed
rest
periods
when
they
were
alone
so
amory
ran
it
out
at
a
great
rate
bringing
the
most
eccentric
characters
to
dinner
grad
students
preceptors
with
strange
theories
of
god
and
government
to
the
cynical
amazement
of
the
supercilious
cottage
club
as
february
became
slashed
by
sun
and
moved
cheerfully
into
march
amory
went
several
times
to
spend
with
monsignor
once
he
took
burne
with
great
success
for
he
took
equal
pride
and
delight
in
displaying
them
to
each
other
monsignor
took
him
several
times
to
see
thornton
hancock
and
once
or
twice
to
the
house
of
a
lawrence
a
type
of
american
whom
amory
liked
immediately
then
one
day
came
a
letter
from
monsignor
which
appended
an
interesting
do
you
know
it
ran
that
your
third
cousin
clara
page
widowed
six
months
and
very
poor
is
living
in
philadelphia
i
do
think
you
ever
met
her
but
i
wish
as
a
favor
to
me
you
go
to
see
her
to
my
mind
she
rather
a
remarkable
woman
and
just
about
your
amory
sighed
and
decided
to
go
as
a
favor
clara
she
was
immemorial
amory
was
good
enough
for
clara
clara
of
ripply
golden
hair
but
then
no
man
was
her
goodness
was
above
the
prosy
morals
of
the
apart
from
the
dull
literature
of
female
virtue
sorrow
lay
lightly
around
her
and
when
amory
found
her
in
philadelphia
he
thought
her
steely
blue
eyes
held
only
happiness
a
latent
strength
a
realism
was
brought
to
its
fullest
development
by
the
facts
that
she
was
compelled
to
face
she
was
alone
in
the
world
with
two
small
children
little
money
and
worst
of
all
a
host
of
friends
he
saw
her
that
winter
in
philadelphia
entertaining
a
houseful
of
men
for
an
evening
when
he
knew
she
had
not
a
servant
in
the
house
except
the
little
colored
girl
guarding
the
babies
overhead
he
saw
one
of
the
greatest
libertines
in
that
city
a
man
who
was
habitually
drunk
and
notorious
at
home
and
abroad
sitting
opposite
her
for
an
evening
discussing
with
a
sort
of
innocent
excitement
what
a
twist
clara
had
to
her
mind
she
could
make
fascinating
and
almost
brilliant
conversation
out
of
the
thinnest
air
that
ever
floated
through
a
the
idea
that
the
girl
was
had
appealed
to
sense
of
situation
he
arrived
in
philadelphia
expecting
to
be
told
that
ark
street
was
in
a
miserable
lane
of
hovels
he
was
even
disappointed
when
it
proved
to
be
nothing
of
the
sort
it
was
an
old
house
that
had
been
in
her
husband
family
for
years
an
elderly
aunt
who
objected
to
having
it
sold
had
put
ten
years
taxes
with
a
lawyer
and
pranced
off
to
honolulu
leaving
clara
to
struggle
with
the
as
best
she
could
so
no
woman
with
a
hungry
baby
at
her
breast
and
a
sad
look
greeted
him
instead
amory
would
have
thought
from
his
reception
that
she
had
not
a
care
in
the
world
a
calm
virility
and
a
dreamy
humor
marked
contrasts
to
her
into
these
moods
she
slipped
sometimes
as
a
refuge
she
could
do
the
most
prosy
things
though
she
was
wise
enough
never
to
stultify
herself
with
such
household
arts
as
and
yet
immediately
afterward
pick
up
a
book
and
let
her
imagination
rove
as
a
formless
cloud
with
the
wind
deepest
of
all
in
her
personality
was
the
golden
radiance
that
she
diffused
around
her
as
an
open
fire
in
a
dark
room
throws
romance
and
pathos
into
the
quiet
faces
at
its
edge
so
she
cast
her
lights
and
shadows
around
the
rooms
that
held
her
until
she
made
of
her
prosy
old
uncle
a
man
of
quaint
and
meditative
charm
metamorphosed
the
stray
telegraph
boy
into
a
creature
of
delightful
originality
at
first
this
quality
of
hers
somehow
irritated
amory
he
considered
his
own
uniqueness
sufficient
and
it
rather
embarrassed
him
when
she
tried
to
read
new
interests
into
him
for
the
benefit
of
what
other
adorers
were
present
he
felt
as
if
a
polite
but
insistent
were
attempting
to
make
him
give
a
new
interpretation
of
a
part
he
had
conned
for
years
but
clara
talking
clara
telling
a
slender
tale
of
a
hatpin
and
an
inebriated
man
and
herself
people
tried
afterward
to
repeat
her
anecdotes
but
for
the
life
of
them
they
could
make
them
sound
like
nothing
whatever
they
gave
her
a
sort
of
innocent
attention
and
the
best
smiles
many
of
them
had
smiled
for
long
there
were
few
tears
in
clara
but
people
smiled
at
her
very
occasionally
amory
stayed
for
little
after
the
rest
of
the
court
had
gone
and
they
would
have
bread
and
jam
and
tea
late
in
the
afternoon
or
lunches
as
she
called
them
at
night
you
remarkable
are
you
amory
was
becoming
trite
from
where
he
perched
in
the
centre
of
the
table
one
six
not
a
bit
she
answered
she
was
searching
out
napkins
in
the
sideboard
i
really
most
humdrum
and
commonplace
one
of
those
people
who
have
no
interest
in
anything
but
their
tell
that
to
somebody
else
scoffed
amory
you
know
you
perfectly
he
asked
her
the
one
thing
that
he
knew
might
embarrass
her
it
was
the
remark
that
the
first
bore
made
to
adam
tell
me
about
and
she
gave
the
answer
that
adam
must
have
given
there
nothing
to
but
eventually
adam
probably
told
the
bore
all
the
things
he
thought
about
at
night
when
the
locusts
sang
in
the
sandy
grass
and
he
must
have
remarked
patronizingly
how
he
was
from
eve
forgetting
how
different
she
was
from
him
at
any
rate
clara
told
amory
much
about
herself
that
evening
she
had
had
a
harried
life
from
sixteen
on
and
her
education
had
stopped
sharply
with
her
leisure
browsing
in
her
library
amory
found
a
tattered
gray
book
out
of
which
fell
a
yellow
sheet
that
he
impudently
opened
it
was
a
poem
that
she
had
written
at
school
about
a
gray
convent
wall
on
a
gray
day
and
a
girl
with
her
cloak
blown
by
the
wind
sitting
atop
of
it
and
thinking
about
the
world
as
a
rule
such
sentiment
bored
him
but
this
was
done
with
so
much
simplicity
and
atmosphere
that
it
brought
a
picture
of
clara
to
his
mind
of
clara
on
such
a
cool
gray
day
with
her
keen
blue
eyes
staring
out
trying
to
see
her
tragedies
come
marching
over
the
gardens
outside
he
envied
that
poem
how
he
would
have
loved
to
have
come
along
and
seen
her
on
the
wall
and
talked
nonsense
or
romance
to
her
perched
above
him
in
the
air
he
began
to
be
frightfully
jealous
of
everything
about
clara
of
her
past
of
her
babies
of
the
men
and
women
who
flocked
to
drink
deep
of
her
cool
kindness
and
rest
their
tired
minds
as
at
an
absorbing
play
seems
to
bore
you
he
objected
about
half
the
world
do
she
admitted
but
i
think
that
a
pretty
good
average
do
you
and
she
turned
to
find
something
in
browning
that
bore
on
the
subject
she
was
the
only
person
he
ever
met
who
could
look
up
passages
and
quotations
to
show
him
in
the
middle
of
the
conversation
and
yet
not
be
irritating
to
distraction
she
did
it
constantly
with
such
a
serious
enthusiasm
that
he
grew
fond
of
watching
her
golden
hair
bent
over
a
book
brow
wrinkled
ever
so
little
at
hunting
her
sentence
through
early
march
he
took
to
going
to
philadelphia
for
almost
always
there
was
some
one
else
there
and
she
seemed
not
anxious
to
see
him
alone
for
many
occasions
presented
themselves
when
a
word
from
her
would
have
given
him
another
delicious
of
adoration
but
he
fell
gradually
in
love
and
began
to
speculate
wildly
on
marriage
though
this
design
flowed
through
his
brain
even
to
his
lips
still
he
knew
afterward
that
the
desire
had
not
been
deeply
rooted
once
he
dreamt
that
it
had
come
true
and
woke
up
in
a
cold
panic
for
in
his
dream
she
had
been
a
silly
flaxen
clara
with
the
gold
gone
out
of
her
hair
and
platitudes
falling
insipidly
from
her
changeling
tongue
but
she
was
the
first
fine
woman
he
ever
knew
and
one
of
the
few
good
people
who
ever
interested
him
she
made
her
goodness
such
an
asset
amory
had
decided
that
most
good
people
either
dragged
theirs
after
them
as
a
liability
or
else
distorted
it
to
artificial
geniality
and
of
course
there
were
the
prig
and
pharisee
but
amory
never
included
as
being
among
the
saved
cecilia
over
her
gray
and
velvet
dress
under
her
molten
beaten
hair
color
of
rose
in
mock
distress
flushes
and
fades
and
makes
her
fair
fills
the
air
from
her
to
him
with
light
and
languor
and
little
sighs
just
so
subtly
he
scarcely
knows
laughing
lightning
color
of
do
you
like
me
of
course
i
do
said
clara
seriously
why
well
we
have
some
qualities
in
common
things
that
are
spontaneous
in
each
of
us
or
were
you
implying
that
i
have
used
myself
very
well
clara
hesitated
well
i
ca
judge
a
man
of
course
has
to
go
through
a
lot
more
and
i
been
oh
do
stall
please
clara
amory
interrupted
but
do
talk
about
me
a
little
wo
you
surely
i
adore
she
did
smile
that
sweet
of
you
first
answer
some
questions
am
i
painfully
conceited
well
no
you
have
tremendous
vanity
but
it
amuse
the
people
who
notice
its
i
you
really
humble
at
heart
you
sink
to
the
third
hell
of
depression
when
you
think
you
been
slighted
in
fact
you
have
much
centre
of
target
twice
clara
how
do
you
do
it
you
never
let
me
say
a
of
course
not
i
can
never
judge
a
man
while
he
talking
but
i
not
through
the
reason
you
have
so
little
real
even
though
you
gravely
announce
to
the
occasional
philistine
that
you
think
a
genius
is
that
you
attributed
all
sorts
of
atrocious
faults
to
yourself
and
are
trying
to
live
up
to
them
for
instance
you
always
saying
that
you
are
a
slave
to
but
i
am
and
you
say
you
a
weak
character
that
you
no
not
a
bit
of
will
i
a
slave
to
my
emotions
to
my
likes
to
my
hatred
of
boredom
to
most
of
my
desires
you
are
not
she
brought
one
little
fist
down
onto
the
other
you
a
slave
a
bound
helpless
slave
to
one
thing
in
the
world
your
you
certainly
interest
me
if
this
is
boring
you
go
i
notice
that
when
you
want
to
stay
over
an
extra
day
from
college
you
go
about
it
in
a
sure
way
you
never
decide
at
first
while
the
merits
of
going
or
staying
are
fairly
clear
in
your
mind
you
let
your
imagination
shinny
on
the
side
of
your
desires
for
a
few
hours
and
then
you
decide
naturally
your
imagination
after
a
little
freedom
thinks
up
a
million
reasons
why
you
should
stay
so
your
decision
when
it
comes
is
true
it
yes
objected
amory
but
is
it
lack
of
to
let
my
imagination
shinny
on
the
wrong
side
my
dear
boy
there
your
big
mistake
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
a
crazy
useless
word
anyway
you
lack
judgment
the
judgment
to
decide
at
once
when
you
know
your
imagination
will
play
you
false
given
half
a
well
i
be
darned
exclaimed
amory
in
surprise
that
the
last
thing
i
clara
did
gloat
she
changed
the
subject
immediately
but
she
had
started
him
thinking
and
he
believed
she
was
partly
right
he
felt
like
a
who
after
accusing
a
clerk
of
dishonesty
finds
that
his
own
son
in
the
office
is
changing
the
books
once
a
week
his
poor
mistreated
will
that
he
had
been
holding
up
to
the
scorn
of
himself
and
his
friends
stood
before
him
innocent
and
his
judgment
walked
off
to
prison
with
the
unconfinable
imp
imagination
dancing
in
mocking
glee
beside
him
clara
was
the
only
advice
he
ever
asked
without
dictating
the
answer
himself
except
perhaps
in
his
talks
with
monsignor
darcy
how
he
loved
to
do
any
sort
of
thing
with
clara
shopping
with
her
was
a
rare
epicurean
dream
in
every
store
where
she
had
ever
traded
she
was
whispered
about
as
the
beautiful
mrs
page
i
bet
she
wo
stay
single
well
do
scream
it
out
she
ai
lookin
for
no
she
beautiful
enter
a
silence
till
he
moves
forward
smirking
society
person
ai
she
yeah
but
poor
now
i
guess
so
they
gee
girls
she
some
kid
and
clara
beamed
on
all
alike
amory
believed
that
tradespeople
gave
her
discounts
sometimes
to
her
knowledge
and
sometimes
without
it
he
knew
she
dressed
very
well
had
always
the
best
of
everything
in
the
house
and
was
inevitably
waited
upon
by
the
head
at
the
very
least
sometimes
they
would
go
to
church
together
on
sunday
and
he
would
walk
beside
her
and
revel
in
her
cheeks
moist
from
the
soft
water
in
the
new
air
she
was
very
devout
always
had
been
and
god
knows
what
heights
she
attained
and
what
strength
she
drew
down
to
herself
when
she
knelt
and
bent
her
golden
hair
into
the
light
st
cecelia
he
cried
aloud
one
day
quite
involuntarily
and
the
people
turned
and
peered
and
the
priest
paused
in
his
sermon
and
clara
and
amory
turned
to
fiery
red
that
was
the
last
sunday
they
had
for
he
spoiled
it
all
that
night
he
could
help
it
they
were
walking
through
the
march
twilight
where
it
was
as
warm
as
june
and
the
joy
of
youth
filled
his
soul
so
that
he
felt
he
must
speak
i
think
he
said
and
his
voice
trembled
that
if
i
lost
faith
in
you
i
lose
faith
in
she
looked
at
him
with
such
a
startled
face
that
he
asked
her
the
matter
nothing
she
said
slowly
only
this
five
men
have
said
that
to
me
before
and
it
frightens
oh
clara
is
that
your
fate
she
did
not
answer
i
suppose
love
to
you
is
he
began
she
turned
like
a
flash
i
have
never
been
in
they
walked
along
and
he
realized
slowly
how
much
she
had
told
him
never
in
love
she
seemed
suddenly
a
daughter
of
light
alone
his
entity
dropped
out
of
her
plane
and
he
longed
only
to
touch
her
dress
with
almost
the
realization
that
joseph
must
have
had
of
mary
eternal
significance
but
quite
mechanically
he
heard
himself
saying
and
i
love
you
any
latent
greatness
that
i
got
is
oh
i
talk
but
clara
if
i
come
back
in
two
years
in
a
position
to
marry
you
she
shook
her
head
no
she
said
i
never
marry
again
i
got
my
two
children
and
i
want
myself
for
them
i
like
you
i
like
all
clever
men
you
more
than
any
but
you
know
me
well
enough
to
know
that
i
never
marry
a
clever
man
she
broke
off
suddenly
what
you
not
in
love
with
me
you
never
wanted
to
marry
me
did
you
it
was
the
twilight
he
said
wonderingly
i
did
feel
as
though
i
were
speaking
aloud
but
i
love
you
or
adore
you
or
worship
you
there
you
go
running
through
your
catalogue
of
emotions
in
five
he
smiled
unwillingly
do
make
me
out
such
a
clara
you
depressing
you
not
a
of
all
things
she
said
intently
taking
his
arm
and
opening
wide
her
eyes
he
could
see
their
kindliness
in
the
fading
dusk
a
is
an
eternal
there
so
much
spring
in
the
air
there
so
much
lazy
sweetness
in
your
she
dropped
his
arm
you
all
fine
now
and
i
feel
glorious
give
me
a
cigarette
never
seen
me
smoke
have
you
well
i
do
about
once
a
and
then
that
wonderful
girl
and
amory
raced
to
the
corner
like
two
mad
children
gone
wild
with
twilight
i
going
to
the
country
for
she
announced
as
she
stood
panting
safe
beyond
the
flare
of
the
corner
these
days
are
too
magnificent
to
miss
though
perhaps
i
feel
them
more
in
the
oh
clara
amory
said
what
a
devil
you
could
have
been
if
the
lord
had
just
bent
your
soul
a
little
the
other
way
maybe
she
answered
but
i
think
not
i
never
really
wild
and
never
have
been
that
little
outburst
was
pure
and
you
are
too
said
he
they
were
walking
along
now
no
you
wrong
again
how
can
a
person
of
your
own
brains
be
so
constantly
wrong
about
me
i
the
opposite
of
everything
spring
ever
stood
for
it
unfortunate
if
i
happen
to
look
like
what
pleased
some
soppy
old
greek
sculptor
but
i
assure
you
that
if
it
were
for
my
face
i
be
a
quiet
nun
in
the
convent
without
then
she
broke
into
a
run
and
her
raised
voice
floated
back
to
him
as
he
followed
my
precious
babies
which
i
must
go
back
and
she
was
the
only
girl
he
ever
knew
with
whom
he
could
understand
how
another
man
might
be
preferred
often
amory
met
wives
whom
he
had
known
as
debutantes
and
looking
intently
at
them
imagined
that
he
found
something
in
their
faces
which
said
oh
if
i
could
only
have
gotten
oh
the
enormous
conceit
of
the
man
but
that
night
seemed
a
night
of
stars
and
singing
and
clara
bright
soul
still
gleamed
on
the
ways
they
had
trod
golden
golden
is
the
air
he
chanted
to
the
little
pools
of
water
golden
is
the
air
golden
notes
from
golden
mandolins
golden
frets
of
golden
violins
fair
oh
wearily
fair
skeins
from
braided
basket
mortals
may
not
hold
oh
what
young
extravagant
god
who
would
know
or
ask
it
who
could
give
such
gold
amory
is
resentful
slowly
and
inevitably
yet
with
a
sudden
surge
at
the
last
while
amory
talked
and
dreamed
war
rolled
swiftly
up
the
beach
and
washed
the
sands
where
princeton
played
every
night
the
gymnasium
echoed
as
platoon
after
platoon
swept
over
the
floor
and
shuffled
out
the
markings
when
amory
went
to
washington
the
next
he
caught
some
of
the
spirit
of
crisis
which
changed
to
repulsion
in
the
pullman
car
coming
back
for
the
berths
across
from
him
were
occupied
by
stinking
aliens
greeks
he
guessed
or
russians
he
thought
how
much
easier
patriotism
had
been
to
a
homogeneous
race
how
much
easier
it
would
have
been
to
fight
as
the
colonies
fought
or
as
the
confederacy
fought
and
he
did
no
sleeping
that
night
but
listened
to
the
aliens
guffaw
and
snore
while
they
filled
the
car
with
the
heavy
scent
of
latest
america
in
princeton
every
one
bantered
in
public
and
told
themselves
privately
that
their
deaths
at
least
would
be
heroic
the
literary
students
read
rupert
brooke
passionately
the
worried
over
whether
the
government
would
permit
the
uniform
for
officers
a
few
of
the
hopelessly
lazy
wrote
to
the
obscure
branches
of
the
war
department
seeking
an
easy
commission
and
a
soft
berth
then
after
a
week
amory
saw
burne
and
knew
at
once
that
argument
would
be
futile
burne
had
come
out
as
a
pacifist
the
socialist
magazines
a
great
smattering
of
tolstoi
and
his
own
intense
longing
for
a
cause
that
would
bring
out
whatever
strength
lay
in
him
had
finally
decided
him
to
preach
peace
as
a
subjective
ideal
when
the
german
army
entered
belgium
he
began
if
the
inhabitants
had
gone
peaceably
about
their
business
the
german
army
would
have
been
disorganized
in
i
know
amory
interrupted
i
heard
it
all
but
i
not
going
to
talk
propaganda
with
you
there
a
chance
that
you
right
but
even
so
we
hundreds
of
years
before
the
time
when
can
touch
us
as
a
but
amory
listen
burne
we
just
argue
very
just
one
thing
i
do
ask
you
to
think
of
your
family
or
friends
because
i
know
they
do
count
a
picayune
with
you
beside
your
sense
of
duty
but
burne
how
do
you
know
that
the
magazines
you
read
and
the
societies
you
join
and
these
idealists
you
meet
are
just
plain
some
of
them
are
of
how
do
you
know
they
are
just
a
lot
of
weak
ones
with
that
the
chance
of
course
he
said
slowly
how
much
or
how
little
i
taking
this
stand
because
of
propaganda
i
heard
i
do
know
naturally
i
think
that
it
my
most
innermost
conviction
it
seems
a
path
spread
before
me
just
amory
heart
sank
but
think
of
the
cheapness
of
it
no
one
really
going
to
martyr
you
for
being
a
pacifist
it
just
going
to
throw
you
in
with
the
worst
i
doubt
it
he
interrupted
well
it
all
smells
of
bohemian
new
york
to
i
know
what
you
mean
and
that
why
i
not
sure
i
you
one
man
burne
going
to
talk
to
people
who
wo
listen
with
all
god
given
that
what
stephen
must
have
thought
many
years
ago
but
he
preached
his
sermon
and
they
killed
him
he
probably
thought
as
he
was
dying
what
a
waste
it
all
was
but
you
see
i
always
felt
that
stephen
death
was
the
thing
that
occurred
to
paul
on
the
road
to
damascus
and
sent
him
to
preach
the
word
of
christ
all
over
the
go
that
all
this
is
my
particular
duty
even
if
right
now
i
just
a
pawn
just
sacrificed
god
amory
you
do
think
i
like
the
germans
well
i
ca
say
anything
else
i
get
to
the
end
of
all
the
logic
about
and
there
like
an
excluded
middle
stands
the
huge
spectre
of
man
as
he
is
and
always
will
be
and
this
spectre
stands
right
beside
the
one
logical
necessity
of
tolstoi
and
the
other
logical
necessity
of
nietzsche
amory
broke
off
suddenly
when
are
you
going
i
going
next
i
see
you
of
as
he
walked
away
it
seemed
to
amory
that
the
look
in
his
face
bore
a
great
resemblance
to
that
in
kerry
when
he
had
said
under
blair
arch
two
years
before
amory
wondered
unhappily
why
he
could
never
go
into
anything
with
the
primal
honesty
of
those
two
burne
a
fanatic
he
said
to
tom
and
he
dead
wrong
and
inclined
to
think
just
an
unconscious
pawn
in
the
hands
of
anarchistic
publishers
and
rag
wavers
but
he
haunts
me
just
leaving
everything
worth
while
burne
left
in
a
quietly
dramatic
manner
a
week
later
he
sold
all
his
possessions
and
came
down
to
the
room
to
say
with
a
battered
old
bicycle
on
which
he
intended
to
ride
to
his
home
in
pennsylvania
peter
the
hermit
bidding
farewell
to
cardinal
richelieu
suggested
alec
who
was
lounging
in
the
as
burne
and
amory
shook
hands
but
amory
was
not
in
a
mood
for
that
and
as
he
saw
burne
long
legs
propel
his
ridiculous
bicycle
out
of
sight
beyond
alexander
hall
he
knew
he
was
going
to
have
a
bad
week
not
that
he
doubted
the
war
germany
stood
for
everything
repugnant
to
him
for
materialism
and
the
direction
of
tremendous
licentious
force
it
was
just
that
face
stayed
in
his
memory
and
he
was
sick
of
the
hysteria
he
was
beginning
to
hear
what
on
earth
is
the
use
of
suddenly
running
down
goethe
he
declared
to
alec
and
tom
why
write
books
to
prove
he
started
the
war
or
that
that
stupid
overestimated
schiller
is
a
demon
in
disguise
have
you
ever
read
anything
of
theirs
asked
tom
shrewdly
no
amory
admitted
neither
have
i
he
said
laughing
people
will
shout
said
alec
quietly
but
goethe
on
his
same
old
shelf
in
the
library
to
bore
any
one
that
wants
to
read
him
amory
subsided
and
the
subject
dropped
what
are
you
going
to
do
amory
infantry
or
aviation
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
i
hate
mechanics
but
then
of
course
aviation
the
thing
for
me
i
feel
as
amory
does
said
tom
infantry
or
aviation
aviation
sounds
like
the
romantic
side
of
the
war
of
course
like
cavalry
used
to
be
you
know
but
like
amory
i
do
know
a
from
a
somehow
amory
dissatisfaction
with
his
lack
of
enthusiasm
culminated
in
an
attempt
to
put
the
blame
for
the
whole
war
on
the
ancestors
of
his
generation
all
the
people
who
cheered
for
germany
in
all
the
materialists
rampant
all
the
idolizers
of
german
science
and
efficiency
so
he
sat
one
day
in
an
english
lecture
and
heard
locksley
hall
quoted
and
fell
into
a
brown
study
with
contempt
for
tennyson
and
all
he
stood
for
for
he
took
him
as
a
representative
of
the
victorians
victorians
victorians
who
never
learned
to
weep
who
sowed
the
bitter
harvest
that
your
children
go
to
reap
scribbled
amory
in
his
the
lecturer
was
saying
something
about
tennyson
solidity
and
fifty
heads
were
bent
to
take
notes
amory
turned
over
to
a
fresh
page
and
began
scrawling
again
they
shuddered
when
they
found
what
darwin
was
about
they
shuddered
when
the
waltz
came
in
and
newman
hurried
out
but
the
waltz
came
in
much
earlier
he
crossed
that
out
and
entitled
a
song
in
the
time
of
order
came
the
professor
voice
droning
far
away
time
of
order
good
lord
everything
crammed
in
the
box
and
the
victorians
sitting
on
the
lid
smiling
serenely
with
browning
in
his
italian
villa
crying
bravely
all
for
the
amory
scribbled
again
you
knelt
up
in
the
temple
and
he
bent
to
hear
you
pray
you
thanked
him
for
your
gains
reproached
him
for
why
could
he
never
get
more
than
a
couplet
at
a
time
now
he
needed
something
to
rhyme
with
you
would
keep
him
straight
with
science
tho
he
had
gone
wrong
before
well
anyway
you
met
your
children
in
your
home
fixed
it
up
you
cried
took
your
fifty
years
of
europe
and
then
virtuously
that
was
to
a
great
extent
tennyson
idea
came
the
lecturer
voice
swinburne
song
in
the
time
of
order
might
well
have
been
title
he
idealized
order
against
chaos
against
at
last
amory
had
it
he
turned
over
another
page
and
scrawled
vigorously
for
the
twenty
minutes
that
was
left
of
the
hour
then
he
walked
up
to
the
desk
and
deposited
a
page
torn
out
of
his
here
a
poem
to
the
victorians
sir
he
said
coldly
the
professor
picked
it
up
curiously
while
amory
backed
rapidly
through
the
door
here
is
what
he
had
written
songs
in
the
time
of
order
you
left
for
us
to
sing
proofs
with
excluded
middles
answers
to
life
in
rhyme
keys
of
the
prison
warder
and
ancient
bells
to
ring
time
was
the
end
of
riddles
we
were
the
end
of
time
here
were
domestic
oceans
and
a
sky
that
we
might
reach
guns
and
a
guarded
border
gantlets
but
not
to
fling
thousands
of
old
emotions
and
a
platitude
for
each
songs
in
the
time
of
order
and
tongues
that
we
might
the
end
of
many
things
early
april
slipped
by
in
a
haze
a
haze
of
long
evenings
on
the
club
veranda
with
the
graphophone
playing
poor
butterfly
inside
for
poor
butterfly
had
been
the
song
of
that
last
year
the
war
seemed
scarcely
to
touch
them
and
it
might
have
been
one
of
the
senior
springs
of
the
past
except
for
the
drilling
every
other
afternoon
yet
amory
realized
poignantly
that
this
was
the
last
spring
under
the
old
regime
this
is
the
great
protest
against
the
superman
said
amory
i
suppose
so
alec
agreed
he
absolutely
irreconcilable
with
any
utopia
as
long
as
he
occurs
there
trouble
and
all
the
latent
evil
that
makes
a
crowd
list
and
sway
when
he
and
of
course
all
that
he
is
is
a
gifted
man
without
a
moral
that
all
i
think
the
worst
thing
to
contemplate
is
this
all
happened
before
how
soon
will
it
happen
again
fifty
years
after
waterloo
napoleon
was
as
much
a
hero
to
english
school
children
as
wellington
how
do
we
know
our
grandchildren
wo
idolize
von
hindenburg
the
same
way
what
brings
it
about
time
damn
it
and
the
historian
if
we
could
only
learn
to
look
on
evil
as
evil
whether
it
clothed
in
filth
or
monotony
or
god
have
we
raked
the
universe
over
the
coals
for
four
years
then
the
night
came
that
was
to
be
the
last
tom
and
amory
bound
in
the
morning
for
different
paced
the
shadowy
walks
as
usual
and
seemed
still
to
see
around
them
the
faces
of
the
men
they
knew
the
grass
is
full
of
ghosts
the
whole
campus
is
alive
with
they
paused
by
little
and
watched
the
moon
rise
to
make
silver
of
the
slate
roof
of
dodd
and
blue
the
rustling
trees
you
know
whispered
tom
what
we
feel
now
is
the
sense
of
all
the
gorgeous
youth
that
has
rioted
through
here
in
two
hundred
a
last
burst
of
singing
flooded
up
from
blair
arch
broken
voices
for
some
long
parting
and
what
we
leave
here
is
more
than
this
class
it
the
whole
heritage
of
youth
we
just
one
generation
we
breaking
all
the
links
that
seemed
to
bind
us
here
to
and
generations
walked
arm
and
arm
with
burr
and
harry
lee
through
half
these
that
what
they
are
tom
tangented
off
deep
blue
a
bit
of
color
would
spoil
them
make
them
exotic
spires
against
a
sky
a
promise
of
dawn
and
blue
light
on
the
slate
roofs
it
hurts
rather
aaron
burr
amory
called
toward
deserted
nassau
hall
you
and
i
knew
strange
corners
of
his
voice
echoed
in
the
stillness
the
torches
are
out
whispered
tom
ah
messalina
the
long
shadows
are
building
minarets
on
the
stadium
for
an
instant
the
voices
of
freshman
year
surged
around
them
and
then
they
looked
at
each
other
with
faint
tears
in
their
eyes
damn
damn
the
last
light
fades
and
drifts
across
the
land
the
low
long
land
the
sunny
land
of
spires
the
ghosts
of
evening
tune
again
their
lyres
and
wander
singing
in
a
plaintive
band
down
the
long
corridors
of
trees
pale
fires
echo
the
night
from
tower
top
to
tower
oh
sleep
that
dreams
and
dream
that
never
tires
press
from
the
petals
of
the
lotus
flower
something
of
this
to
keep
the
essence
of
an
hour
no
more
to
wait
the
twilight
of
the
moon
in
this
sequestered
vale
of
star
and
spire
for
one
eternal
morning
of
desire
passes
to
time
and
earthy
afternoon
here
heraclitus
did
you
find
in
fire
and
shifting
things
the
prophecy
you
hurled
down
the
dead
years
this
midnight
my
desire
will
see
shadowed
among
the
embers
furled
in
flame
the
splendor
and
the
sadness
of
the
world
interlude
may
a
letter
dated
january
written
by
monsignor
darcy
to
amory
who
is
a
second
lieutenant
in
the
infantry
port
of
embarkation
camp
mills
long
island
my
dear
boy
all
you
need
tell
me
of
yourself
is
that
you
still
are
for
the
rest
i
merely
search
back
in
a
restive
memory
a
thermometer
that
records
only
fevers
and
match
you
with
what
i
was
at
your
age
but
men
will
chatter
and
you
and
i
will
still
shout
our
futilities
to
each
other
across
the
stage
until
the
last
silly
curtain
falls
upon
our
bobbing
heads
but
you
are
starting
the
spluttering
show
of
life
with
much
the
same
array
of
slides
as
i
had
so
i
need
to
write
you
if
only
to
shriek
the
colossal
stupidity
of
people
this
is
the
end
of
one
thing
for
better
or
worse
you
will
never
again
be
quite
the
amory
blaine
that
i
knew
never
again
will
we
meet
as
we
have
met
because
your
generation
is
growing
hard
much
harder
than
mine
ever
grew
nourished
as
they
were
on
the
stuff
of
the
nineties
amory
lately
i
reread
aeschylus
and
there
in
the
divine
irony
of
the
agamemnon
i
find
the
only
answer
to
this
bitter
age
all
the
world
tumbled
about
our
ears
and
the
closest
parallel
ages
back
in
that
hopeless
resignation
there
are
times
when
i
think
of
the
men
out
there
as
roman
legionaries
miles
from
their
corrupt
city
stemming
back
the
hordes
hordes
a
little
more
menacing
after
all
than
the
corrupt
city
another
blind
blow
at
the
race
furies
that
we
passed
with
ovations
years
ago
over
whose
corpses
we
bleated
triumphantly
all
through
the
victorian
era
and
afterward
an
materialistic
world
and
the
catholic
church
i
wonder
where
you
fit
in
of
one
thing
i
sure
celtic
you
live
and
celtic
you
die
so
if
you
do
use
heaven
as
a
continual
referendum
for
your
ideas
you
find
earth
a
continual
recall
to
your
ambitions
amory
i
discovered
suddenly
that
i
an
old
man
like
all
old
men
i
had
dreams
sometimes
and
i
going
to
tell
you
of
them
enjoyed
imagining
that
you
were
my
son
that
perhaps
when
i
was
young
i
went
into
a
state
of
coma
and
begat
you
and
when
i
came
to
had
no
recollection
of
it
it
the
paternal
instinct
amory
celibacy
goes
deeper
than
the
flesh
sometimes
i
think
that
the
explanation
of
our
deep
resemblance
is
some
common
ancestor
and
i
find
that
the
only
blood
that
the
darcys
and
the
have
in
common
is
that
of
the
stephen
was
his
name
i
think
when
the
lightning
strikes
one
of
us
it
strikes
both
you
had
hardly
arrived
at
the
port
of
embarkation
when
i
got
my
papers
to
start
for
rome
and
i
am
waiting
every
moment
to
be
told
where
to
take
ship
even
before
you
get
this
letter
i
shall
be
on
the
ocean
then
will
come
your
turn
you
went
to
war
as
a
gentleman
should
just
as
you
went
to
school
and
college
because
it
was
the
thing
to
do
it
better
to
leave
the
blustering
and
to
the
middle
classes
they
do
it
so
much
better
do
you
remember
that
last
march
when
you
brought
burne
holiday
from
princeton
to
see
me
what
a
magnificent
boy
he
is
it
gave
me
a
frightful
shock
afterward
when
you
wrote
that
he
thought
me
splendid
how
could
he
be
so
deceived
splendid
is
the
one
thing
that
neither
you
nor
i
are
we
are
many
other
things
we
extraordinary
we
clever
we
could
be
said
i
suppose
to
be
brilliant
we
can
attract
people
we
can
make
atmosphere
we
can
almost
lose
our
celtic
souls
in
celtic
subtleties
we
can
almost
always
have
our
own
way
but
splendid
rather
not
i
am
going
to
rome
with
a
wonderful
dossier
and
letters
of
introduction
that
cover
every
capital
in
europe
and
there
will
be
no
small
stir
when
i
get
there
how
i
wish
you
were
with
me
this
sounds
like
a
rather
cynical
paragraph
not
at
all
the
sort
of
thing
that
a
clergyman
should
write
to
a
youth
about
to
depart
for
the
war
the
only
excuse
is
that
the
clergyman
is
talking
to
himself
there
are
deep
things
in
us
and
you
know
what
they
are
as
well
as
i
do
we
have
great
faith
though
yours
at
present
is
uncrystallized
we
have
a
terrible
honesty
that
all
our
sophistry
can
not
destroy
and
above
all
a
childlike
simplicity
that
keeps
us
from
ever
being
really
malicious
i
have
written
a
keen
for
you
which
follows
i
am
sorry
your
cheeks
are
not
up
to
the
description
i
have
written
of
them
but
you
smoke
and
read
all
night
at
any
rate
here
it
is
a
lament
for
a
foster
son
and
he
going
to
the
war
against
the
king
of
foreign
ochone
he
is
gone
from
me
the
son
of
my
mind
and
he
in
his
golden
youth
like
angus
oge
angus
of
the
bright
birds
and
his
mind
strong
and
subtle
like
the
mind
of
cuchulin
on
muirtheme
awirra
sthrue
his
brow
is
as
white
as
the
milk
of
the
cows
of
maeve
and
his
cheeks
like
the
cherries
of
the
tree
and
it
bending
down
to
mary
and
she
feeding
the
son
of
god
aveelia
vrone
his
hair
is
like
the
golden
collar
of
the
kings
at
tara
and
his
eyes
like
the
four
gray
seas
of
erin
and
they
swept
with
the
mists
of
rain
mavrone
go
gudyo
he
to
be
in
the
joyful
and
red
battle
amongst
the
chieftains
and
they
doing
great
deeds
of
valor
his
life
to
go
from
him
it
is
the
chords
of
my
own
soul
would
be
loosed
a
vich
deelish
my
heart
is
in
the
heart
of
my
son
and
my
life
is
in
his
life
surely
a
man
can
be
twice
young
in
the
life
of
his
sons
only
jia
du
vaha
alanav
may
the
son
of
god
be
above
him
and
beneath
him
before
him
and
behind
him
may
the
king
of
the
elements
cast
a
mist
over
the
eyes
of
the
king
of
foreign
may
the
queen
of
the
graces
lead
him
by
the
hand
the
way
he
can
go
through
the
midst
of
his
enemies
and
they
not
seeing
him
may
patrick
of
the
gael
and
collumb
of
the
churches
and
the
five
thousand
saints
of
erin
be
better
than
a
shield
to
him
and
he
got
into
the
fight
och
amory
amory
i
feel
somehow
that
this
is
all
one
or
both
of
us
is
not
going
to
last
out
this
war
i
been
trying
to
tell
you
how
much
this
reincarnation
of
myself
in
you
has
meant
in
the
last
few
years
curiously
alike
we
are
curiously
unlike
dear
boy
and
god
be
with
you
thayer
darcy
embarking
at
night
amory
moved
forward
on
the
deck
until
he
found
a
stool
under
an
electric
light
he
searched
in
his
pocket
for
and
pencil
and
then
began
to
write
slowly
laboriously
we
leave
silent
we
filled
the
still
deserted
street
a
column
of
dim
gray
and
ghosts
rose
startled
at
the
muffled
beat
along
the
moonless
way
the
shadowy
shipyards
echoed
to
the
feet
that
turned
from
night
and
day
and
so
we
linger
on
the
windless
decks
see
on
the
spectre
shore
shades
of
a
thousand
days
poor
wrecks
oh
shall
we
then
deplore
those
futile
years
see
how
the
sea
is
white
the
clouds
have
broken
and
the
heavens
burn
to
hollow
highways
paved
with
gravelled
light
the
churning
of
the
waves
about
the
stern
rises
to
one
voluminous
nocturne
we
leave
a
letter
from
amory
headed
brest
march
to
lieutenant
camp
gordon
dear
baudelaire
we
meet
in
manhattan
on
the
of
this
very
mo
we
then
proceed
to
take
a
very
sporty
apartment
you
and
i
and
alec
who
is
at
me
elbow
as
i
write
i
do
know
what
i
going
to
do
but
i
have
a
vague
dream
of
going
into
politics
why
is
it
that
the
pick
of
the
young
englishmen
from
oxford
and
cambridge
go
into
politics
and
in
the
we
leave
it
to
the
muckers
raised
in
the
ward
educated
in
the
assembly
and
sent
to
congress
bundles
of
corruption
devoid
of
both
ideas
and
ideals
as
the
debaters
used
to
say
even
forty
years
ago
we
had
good
men
in
politics
but
we
we
are
brought
up
to
pile
up
a
million
and
show
what
we
are
made
sometimes
i
wish
i
been
an
englishman
american
life
is
so
damned
dumb
and
stupid
and
healthy
since
poor
beatrice
died
i
probably
have
a
little
money
but
very
darn
little
i
can
forgive
mother
almost
everything
except
the
fact
that
in
a
sudden
burst
of
religiosity
toward
the
end
she
left
half
of
what
remained
to
be
spent
in
windows
and
seminary
endowments
barton
my
lawyer
writes
me
that
my
thousands
are
mostly
in
street
railways
and
that
the
said
street
s
are
losing
money
because
of
the
fares
imagine
a
salary
list
that
gives
a
month
to
a
man
that
ca
read
and
write
yet
i
believe
in
it
even
though
seen
what
was
once
a
sizable
fortune
melt
away
between
speculation
extravagance
the
democratic
administration
and
the
income
tax
modern
that
me
all
over
mabel
at
any
rate
we
have
really
rooms
you
can
get
a
job
on
some
fashion
magazine
and
alec
can
go
into
the
zinc
company
or
whatever
it
is
that
his
people
own
he
looking
over
my
shoulder
and
he
says
a
brass
company
but
i
do
think
it
matters
much
do
you
probably
as
much
corruption
in
money
as
money
as
for
the
amory
he
would
write
immortal
literature
if
he
were
sure
enough
about
anything
to
risk
telling
any
one
else
about
it
there
is
no
more
dangerous
gift
to
posterity
than
a
few
cleverly
turned
platitudes
tom
why
do
you
become
a
catholic
of
course
to
be
a
good
one
have
to
give
up
those
violent
intrigues
you
used
to
tell
me
about
but
you
write
better
poetry
if
you
were
linked
up
to
tall
golden
candlesticks
and
long
even
chants
and
even
if
the
american
priests
are
rather
burgeois
as
beatrice
used
to
say
still
you
need
only
go
to
the
sporty
churches
and
i
introduce
you
to
monsignor
darcy
who
really
is
a
wonder
kerry
death
was
a
blow
so
was
jesse
to
a
certain
extent
and
i
have
a
great
curiosity
to
know
what
queer
corner
of
the
world
has
swallowed
burne
do
you
suppose
he
in
prison
under
some
false
name
i
confess
that
the
war
instead
of
making
me
orthodox
which
is
the
correct
reaction
has
made
me
a
passionate
agnostic
the
catholic
church
has
had
its
wings
clipped
so
often
lately
that
its
part
was
timidly
negligible
and
they
have
any
good
writers
any
more
i
sick
of
chesterton
i
only
discovered
one
soldier
who
passed
through
the
spiritual
crisis
like
this
fellow
donald
hankey
and
the
one
i
knew
was
already
studying
for
the
ministry
so
he
was
ripe
for
it
i
honestly
think
that
all
pretty
much
rot
though
it
seemed
to
give
sentimental
comfort
to
those
at
home
and
may
make
fathers
and
mothers
appreciate
their
children
this
religion
is
rather
valueless
and
fleeting
at
best
i
think
four
men
have
discovered
paris
to
one
that
discovered
god
but
us
you
and
me
and
alec
oh
we
get
a
jap
butler
and
dress
for
dinner
and
have
wine
on
the
table
and
lead
a
contemplative
emotionless
life
until
we
decide
to
use
with
the
property
owners
or
throw
bombs
with
the
bolshevik
god
tom
i
hope
something
happens
restless
as
the
devil
and
have
a
horror
of
getting
fat
or
falling
in
love
and
growing
domestic
the

the

chapter
the
debutante
the
time
is
february
the
place
is
a
large
dainty
bedroom
in
the
connage
house
on
street
new
york
a
girl
room
pink
walls
and
curtains
and
a
pink
bedspread
on
a
bed
pink
and
cream
are
the
motifs
of
the
room
but
the
only
article
of
furniture
in
full
view
is
a
luxurious
with
a
glass
top
and
a
mirror
on
the
walls
there
is
an
expensive
print

great
disorder
consisting
of
the
following
items
seven
or
eight
empty
cardboard
boxes
with
tongues
hanging
panting
from
their
mouths
an
assortment
of
street
dresses
mingled
with
their
sisters
of
the
evening
all
upon
the
table
all
evidently
new
a
roll
of
tulle
which
has
lost
its
dignity
and
wound
itself
tortuously
around
everything
in
sight
and
upon
the
two
small
chairs
a
collection
of
lingerie
that
beggars
description
one
would
enjoy
seeing
the
bill
called
forth
by
the
finery
displayed
and
one
is
possessed
by
a
desire
to
see
the
princess
for
whose
benefit
look
there
some
one
disappointment
this
is
only
a
maid
hunting
for
something
she
lifts
a
heap
from
a
chair
not
there
another
heap
the
the
chiffonier
drawers
she
brings
to
light
several
beautiful
chemises
and
an
amazing
pajama
but
this
does
not
satisfy
her
she
goes
out
an
indistinguishable
mumble
from
the
next
room
now
we
are
getting
warm
this
is
alec
mother
connage
ample
dignified
rouged
to
the
dowager
point
and
quite
worn
out
her
lips
move
significantly
as
she
looks
for
it
her
search
is
less
thorough
than
the
maid
but
there
is
a
touch
of
fury
in
it
that
quite
makes
up
for
its
sketchiness
she
stumbles
on
the
tulle
and
her
damn
is
quite
audible
she
retires
more
chatter
outside
and
a
girl
voice
a
very
spoiled
voice
says
of
all
the
stupid
people
after
a
pause
a
third
seeker
enters
not
she
of
the
spoiled
voice
but
a
younger
edition
this
is
cecelia
connage
sixteen
pretty
shrewd
and
constitutionally
she
is
dressed
for
the
evening
in
a
gown
the
obvious
simplicity
of
which
probably
bores
her
she
goes
to
the
nearest
pile
selects
a
small
pink
garment
and
holds
it
up
appraisingly
cecelia
pink
rosalind
outside
yes
cecelia
snappy
rosalind
yes
cecelia
i
got
it
she
sees
herself
in
the
mirror
of
the
and
commences
to
shimmy
enthusiastically
rosalind
outside
what
are
you
doing
trying
it
on
cecelia
ceases
and
goes
out
carrying
the
garment
at
the
right
shoulder
from
the
other
door
enters
alec
connage
he
looks
around
quickly
and
in
a
huge
voice
shouts
mama
there
is
a
chorus
of
protest
from
next
door
and
encouraged
he
starts
toward
it
but
is
repelled
by
another
chorus
alec
so
where
you
all
are
amory
blaine
is
here
cecelia
quickly
take
him
alec
oh
he
connage
well
you
can
show
him
where
his
room
is
tell
him
sorry
that
i
ca
meet
him
now
alec
he
heard
a
lot
about
you
all
i
wish
you
hurry
telling
him
all
about
the
war
and
he
restless
he
sort
of
temperamental
this
last
suffices
to
draw
cecelia
into
the
room
cecelia
seating
herself
high
upon
lingerie
how
do
you
mean
temperamental
you
used
to
say
that
about
him
in
letters
alec
oh
he
writes
stuff
cecelia
does
he
play
the
piano
alec
do
think
so
cecelia
speculatively
drink
alec
yes
nothing
queer
about
him
cecelia
money
alec
good
lord
ask
him
he
used
to
have
a
lot
and
he
got
some
income
now
connage
appears
connage
alec
of
course
we
glad
to
have
any
friend
of
yours
alec
you
certainly
ought
to
meet
amory
connage
of
course
i
want
to
but
i
think
it
so
childish
of
you
to
leave
a
perfectly
good
home
to
go
and
live
with
two
other
boys
in
some
impossible
apartment
i
hope
it
is
in
order
that
you
can
all
drink
as
much
as
you
want
she
pauses
he
be
a
little
neglected
this
is
rosalind
week
you
see
when
a
girl
comes
out
she
needs
the
attention
rosalind
outside
well
then
prove
it
by
coming
here
and
hooking
me
connage
goes
alec
rosalind
has
changed
a
bit
cecelia
in
a
lower
tone
she
awfully
spoiled
alec
she
meet
her
match
cecelia
who
amory
blaine
alec
nods
cecelia
well
rosalind
has
still
to
meet
the
man
she
ca
outdistance
honestly
alec
she
treats
men
terribly
she
abuses
them
and
cuts
them
and
breaks
dates
with
them
and
yawns
in
their
faces
and
they
come
back
for
more
alec
they
love
it
cecelia
they
hate
it
she
a
she
a
sort
of
vampire
i
think
and
she
can
make
girls
do
what
she
wants
usually
only
she
hates
girls
alec
personality
runs
in
our
family
cecelia
resignedly
i
guess
it
ran
out
before
it
got
to
me
alec
does
rosalind
behave
herself
cecelia
not
particularly
well
oh
she
average
smokes
sometimes
drinks
punch
frequently
kissed
oh
yes
common
knowledge
one
of
the
effects
of
the
war
you
know
emerges
mrs
connage
connage
rosalind
almost
finished
so
i
can
go
down
and
meet
your
friend
alec
and
his
mother
go
out
rosalind
outside
oh
mother
cecelia
mother
gone
down
and
now
rosalind
enters
rosalind
is
utterly
rosalind
she
is
one
of
those
girls
who
need
never
make
the
slightest
effort
to
have
men
fall
in
love
with
them
two
types
of
men
seldom
do
dull
men
are
usually
afraid
of
her
cleverness
and
intellectual
men
are
usually
afraid
of
her
beauty
all
others
are
hers
by
natural
prerogative
if
rosalind
could
be
spoiled
the
process
would
have
been
complete
by
this
time
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
her
disposition
is
not
all
it
should
be
she
wants
what
she
wants
when
she
wants
it
and
she
is
prone
to
make
every
one
around
her
pretty
miserable
when
she
does
get
it
but
in
the
true
sense
she
is
not
spoiled
her
fresh
enthusiasm
her
will
to
grow
and
learn
her
endless
faith
in
the
inexhaustibility
of
romance
her
courage
and
fundamental
honesty
these
things
are
not
spoiled
there
are
long
periods
when
she
cordially
loathes
her
whole
family
she
is
quite
unprincipled
her
philosophy
is
carpe
diem
for
herself
and
laissez
faire
for
others
she
loves
shocking
stories
she
has
that
coarse
streak
that
usually
goes
with
natures
that
are
both
fine
and
big
she
wants
people
to
like
her
but
if
they
do
not
it
never
worries
her
or
changes
her
she
is
by
no
means
a
model
character
the
education
of
all
beautiful
women
is
the
knowledge
of
men
rosalind
had
been
disappointed
in
man
after
man
as
individuals
but
she
had
great
faith
in
man
as
a
sex
women
she
detested
they
represented
qualities
that
she
felt
and
despised
in
herself
incipient
meanness
conceit
cowardice
and
petty
dishonesty
she
once
told
a
roomful
of
her
mother
friends
that
the
only
excuse
for
women
was
the
necessity
for
a
disturbing
element
among
men
she
danced
exceptionally
well
drew
cleverly
but
hastily
and
had
a
startling
facility
with
words
which
she
used
only
in
but
all
criticism
of
rosalind
ends
in
her
beauty
there
was
that
shade
of
glorious
yellow
hair
the
desire
to
imitate
which
supports
the
dye
industry
there
was
the
eternal
kissable
mouth
small
slightly
sensual
and
utterly
disturbing
there
were
gray
eyes
and
an
unimpeachable
skin
with
two
spots
of
vanishing
color
she
was
slender
and
athletic
without
underdevelopment
and
it
was
a
delight
to
watch
her
move
about
a
room
walk
along
a
street
swing
a
golf
club
or
turn
a
a
last
qualification
her
vivid
instant
personality
escaped
that
conscious
theatrical
quality
that
amory
had
found
in
isabelle
monsignor
darcy
would
have
been
quite
up
a
tree
whether
to
call
her
a
personality
or
a
personage
she
was
perhaps
the
delicious
inexpressible
blend
on
the
night
of
her
debut
she
is
for
all
her
strange
stray
wisdom
quite
like
a
happy
little
girl
her
mother
maid
has
just
done
her
hair
but
she
has
decided
impatiently
that
she
can
do
a
better
job
herself
she
is
too
nervous
just
now
to
stay
in
one
place
to
that
we
owe
her
presence
in
this
littered
room
she
is
going
to
speak
isabelle
alto
tones
had
been
like
a
violin
but
if
you
could
hear
rosalind
you
would
say
her
voice
was
musical
as
a
waterfall
rosalind
honestly
there
are
only
two
costumes
in
the
world
that
i
really
enjoy
being
in
combing
her
hair
at
the
a
hoop
skirt
with
pantaloons
the
other
a
quite
charming
in
both
of
them
cecelia
glad
you
coming
out
rosalind
yes
are
you
cecelia
cynically
you
glad
so
you
can
get
married
and
live
on
long
island
with
the
younger
married
you
want
life
to
be
a
chain
of
flirtation
with
a
man
for
every
link
rosalind
it
to
be
one
you
mean
i
it
one
cecelia
ha
rosalind
cecelia
darling
you
do
know
what
a
trial
it
is
to
be
like
me
i
got
to
keep
my
face
like
steel
in
the
street
to
keep
men
from
winking
at
me
if
i
laugh
hard
from
a
front
row
in
the
theatre
the
comedian
plays
to
me
for
the
rest
of
the
evening
if
i
drop
my
voice
my
eyes
my
handkerchief
at
a
dance
my
partner
calls
me
up
on
the
every
day
for
a
week
cecelia
it
must
be
an
awful
strain
rosalind
the
unfortunate
part
is
that
the
only
men
who
interest
me
at
all
are
the
totally
ineligible
ones
now
if
i
were
poor
i
go
on
the
stage
cecelia
yes
you
might
as
well
get
paid
for
the
amount
of
acting
you
do
rosalind
sometimes
when
i
felt
particularly
radiant
i
thought
why
should
this
be
wasted
on
one
man
cecelia
often
when
you
particularly
sulky
i
wondered
why
it
should
all
be
wasted
on
just
one
family
getting
up
i
think
i
go
down
and
meet
amory
blaine
i
like
temperamental
men
rosalind
there
are
any
men
do
know
how
to
be
really
angry
or
really
happy
and
the
ones
that
do
go
to
pieces
cecelia
well
i
glad
i
do
have
all
your
worries
i
engaged
rosalind
with
a
scornful
smile
engaged
why
you
little
lunatic
if
mother
heard
you
talking
like
that
she
send
you
off
to
where
you
belong
cecelia
you
wo
tell
her
though
because
i
know
things
i
could
tell
and
you
too
selfish
rosalind
a
little
annoyed
run
along
little
girl
who
are
you
engaged
to
the
iceman
the
man
that
keeps
the
cecelia
cheap
wit
darling
i
see
you
later
rosalind
oh
be
and
do
that
you
such
a
help
exit
cecelia
rosalind
finished
her
hair
and
rises
humming
she
goes
up
to
the
mirror
and
starts
to
dance
in
front
of
it
on
the
soft
carpet
she
watches
not
her
feet
but
her
eyes
never
casually
but
always
intently
even
when
she
smiles
the
door
suddenly
opens
and
then
slams
behind
amory
very
cool
and
handsome
as
usual
he
melts
into
instant
confusion
he
oh
i
sorry
i
thought
she
smiling
radiantly
oh
you
amory
blaine
are
you
he
regarding
her
closely
and
you
rosalind
she
i
going
to
call
you
amory
oh
come
in
it
all
right
be
right
in
under
her
breath
unfortunately
he
gazing
around
this
is
sort
of
a
new
wrinkle
for
me
she
this
is
no
man
land
he
this
is
where
you
you
pause
she
yes
all
those
things
she
crosses
to
the
bureau
see
here
my
rouge
eye
pencils
he
i
did
know
you
were
that
way
she
what
did
you
expect
he
i
thought
you
be
sort
of
sort
of
sexless
you
know
swim
and
play
golf
she
oh
i
do
but
not
in
business
hours
he
business
she
six
to
two
strictly
he
i
like
to
have
some
stock
in
the
corporation
she
oh
it
not
a
corporation
it
just
rosalind
shares
name
and
everything
goes
at
a
year
he
disapprovingly
sort
of
a
chilly
proposition
she
well
amory
you
do
mind
do
you
when
i
meet
a
man
that
bore
me
to
death
after
two
weeks
perhaps
it
be
different
he
odd
you
have
the
same
point
of
view
on
men
that
i
have
on
women
she
i
not
really
feminine
you
know
in
my
mind
he
interested
go
on
she
no
you
you
go
on
you
made
me
talk
about
myself
against
the
rules
he
rules
she
my
own
rules
but
you
oh
amory
i
hear
you
brilliant
the
family
expects
much
of
you
he
how
encouraging
she
alec
said
you
taught
him
to
think
did
you
i
did
believe
any
one
could
he
no
i
really
quite
dull
he
evidently
does
intend
this
to
be
taken
seriously
she
liar
he
i
i
religious
i
literary
i
i
even
written
poems
she
vers
libre
splendid
she
declaims
the
trees
are
green
the
birds
are
singing
in
the
trees
the
girl
sips
her
poison
the
bird
flies
away
the
girl
he
laughing
no
not
that
kind
she
suddenly
i
like
you
he
do
she
modest
too
he
i
afraid
of
you
i
always
afraid
of
a
girl
until
i
kissed
her
she
emphatically
my
dear
boy
the
war
is
over
he
so
i
always
be
afraid
of
you
she
rather
sadly
i
suppose
you
will
a
slight
hesitation
on
both
their
parts
he
after
due
consideration
listen
this
is
a
frightful
thing
to
ask
she
knowing
what
coming
after
five
minutes
he
but
will
you
kiss
me
or
are
you
afraid
she
i
never
afraid
but
your
reasons
are
so
poor
he
rosalind
i
really
to
kiss
you
she
so
do
i
they
kiss
definitely
and
thoroughly
he
after
a
breathless
second
well
is
your
curiosity
satisfied
she
is
yours
he
no
it
only
aroused
he
looks
it
she
dreamily
i
kissed
dozens
of
men
i
suppose
i
kiss
dozens
more
he
abstractedly
yes
i
suppose
you
could
like
that
she
most
people
like
the
way
i
kiss
he
remembering
himself
good
lord
yes
kiss
me
once
more
rosalind
she
no
my
curiosity
is
generally
satisfied
at
one
he
discouraged
is
that
a
rule
she
i
make
rules
to
fit
the
cases
he
you
and
i
are
somewhat
alike
except
that
i
years
older
in
experience
she
how
old
are
you
he
almost
you
she
nineteen
just
he
i
suppose
you
the
product
of
a
fashionable
school
she
no
i
fairly
raw
material
i
was
expelled
from
spence
forgotten
why
he
what
your
general
trend
she
oh
i
bright
quite
selfish
emotional
when
aroused
fond
of
admiration
he
suddenly
i
do
want
to
fall
in
love
with
you
she
raising
her
eyebrows
nobody
asked
you
to
he
continuing
coldly
but
i
probably
will
i
love
your
mouth
she
hush
please
do
fall
in
love
with
my
mouth
hair
eyes
shoulders
slippers
but
my
mouth
everybody
falls
in
love
with
my
mouth
he
it
quite
beautiful
she
it
too
small
he
no
it
is
let
see
he
kisses
her
again
with
the
same
thoroughness
she
rather
moved
say
something
sweet
he
frightened
lord
help
me
she
drawing
away
well
do
if
it
so
hard
he
shall
we
pretend
so
soon
she
we
have
the
same
standards
of
time
as
other
people
he
already
it
other
people
she
let
pretend
he
no
i
ca
it
sentiment
she
you
not
sentimental
he
no
i
romantic
a
sentimental
person
thinks
things
will
last
a
romantic
person
hopes
against
hope
that
they
wo
sentiment
is
emotional
she
and
you
not
with
her
eyes
you
probably
flatter
yourself
that
that
a
superior
attitude
he
well
rosalind
rosalind
do
argue
kiss
me
again
she
quite
chilly
now
no
i
have
no
desire
to
kiss
you
he
openly
taken
aback
you
wanted
to
kiss
me
a
minute
ago
she
this
is
now
he
i
better
go
she
i
suppose
so
he
goes
toward
the
door
she
oh
he
turns
she
laughing
score
home
team
one
hundred
opponents
zero
he
starts
back
she
quickly
rain
no
game
he
goes
out
she
goes
quietly
to
the
chiffonier
takes
out
a
and
hides
it
in
the
side
drawer
of
a
desk
her
mother
enters
in
hand
connage
good
i
been
wanting
to
speak
to
you
alone
before
we
go
rosalind
heavens
you
frighten
me
connage
rosalind
you
been
a
very
expensive
proposition
rosalind
resignedly
yes
connage
and
you
know
your
father
has
what
he
once
had
rosalind
making
a
wry
face
oh
please
do
talk
about
money
connage
you
ca
do
anything
without
it
this
is
our
last
year
in
this
house
and
unless
things
change
cecelia
wo
have
the
advantages
you
had
rosalind
impatiently
well
what
is
it
connage
so
i
ask
you
to
please
mind
me
in
several
things
i
put
down
in
my
the
first
one
is
do
disappear
with
young
men
there
may
be
a
time
when
it
valuable
but
at
present
i
want
you
on
the
where
i
can
find
you
there
are
certain
men
i
want
to
have
you
meet
and
i
do
like
finding
you
in
some
corner
of
the
conservatory
exchanging
silliness
with
any
one
or
listening
to
it
rosalind
sarcastically
yes
listening
to
it
better
connage
and
do
waste
a
lot
of
time
with
the
college
set
little
boys
nineteen
and
twenty
years
old
i
do
mind
a
prom
or
a
football
game
but
staying
away
from
advantageous
parties
to
eat
in
little
cafes
with
tom
dick
and
harry
rosalind
offering
her
code
which
is
in
its
way
quite
as
high
as
her
mother
mother
it
done
you
ca
run
everything
now
the
way
you
did
in
the
early
nineties
connage
paying
no
attention
there
are
several
bachelor
friends
of
your
father
that
i
want
you
to
meet
youngish
men
rosalind
nodding
wisely
about
connage
sharply
why
not
rosalind
oh
all
right
they
know
life
and
are
so
adorably
tired
looking
shakes
her
head
but
they
dance
connage
i
have
met
blaine
but
i
do
think
you
care
for
him
he
does
sound
like
a
rosalind
mother
i
never
about
money
connage
you
never
keep
it
long
enough
to
think
about
it
rosalind
sighs
yes
i
suppose
some
day
i
marry
a
ton
of
it
out
of
sheer
boredom
connage
referring
to
i
had
a
wire
from
hartford
dawson
ryder
is
coming
up
now
there
a
young
man
i
like
and
floating
in
money
it
seems
to
me
that
since
you
seem
tired
of
howard
gillespie
you
might
give
ryder
some
encouragement
this
is
the
third
time
he
been
up
in
a
month
rosalind
how
did
you
know
i
was
tired
of
howard
gillespie
connage
the
poor
boy
looks
so
miserable
every
time
he
comes
rosalind
that
was
one
of
those
romantic
affairs
all
wrong
connage
her
say
said
at
any
rate
make
us
proud
of
you
rosalind
do
you
think
i
beautiful
connage
you
know
you
are
from
is
heard
the
moan
of
a
violin
being
tuned
the
roll
of
a
drum
connage
turns
quickly
to
her
daughter
connage
come
rosalind
one
minute
her
mother
leaves
rosalind
goes
to
the
glass
where
she
gazes
at
herself
with
great
satisfaction
she
kisses
her
hand
and
touches
her
mirrored
mouth
with
it
then
she
turns
out
the
lights
and
leaves
the
room
silence
for
a
moment
a
few
chords
from
the
piano
the
discreet
patter
of
faint
drums
the
rustle
of
new
silk
all
blend
on
the
staircase
outside
and
drift
in
through
the
partly
opened
door
bundled
figures
pass
in
the
lighted
hall
the
laughter
heard
below
becomes
doubled
and
multiplied
then
some
one
comes
in
closes
the
door
and
switches
on
the
lights
it
is
cecelia
she
goes
to
the
chiffonier
looks
in
the
drawers
hesitates
then
to
the
desk
whence
she
takes
the
and
extracts
one
she
lights
it
and
then
puffing
and
blowing
walks
toward
the
mirror
cecelia
in
tremendously
sophisticated
accents
oh
yes
coming
out
is
a
farce
nowadays
you
know
one
really
plays
around
so
much
before
one
is
seventeen
that
it
positively
anticlimax
shaking
hands
with
a
visionary
nobleman
yes
your
grace
i
i
heard
my
sister
speak
of
you
have
a
puff
they
very
good
they
they
coronas
you
do
smoke
what
a
pity
the
king
allow
it
i
suppose
yes
i
dance
so
she
dances
around
the
room
to
a
tune
from
her
arms
outstretched
to
an
imaginary
partner
the
cigarette
waving
in
her
hand
several
hours
later
the
corner
of
a
den
filled
by
a
very
comfortable
leather
lounge
a
small
light
is
on
each
side
above
and
in
the
middle
over
the
couch
hangs
a
painting
of
a
very
old
very
dignified
gentleman
period
outside
the
music
is
heard
in
a
rosalind
is
seated
on
the
lounge
and
on
her
left
is
howard
gillespie
a
vapid
youth
of
about
he
is
obviously
very
unhappy
and
she
is
quite
bored
gillespie
feebly
what
do
you
mean
i
changed
i
feel
the
same
toward
you
rosalind
but
you
do
look
the
same
to
me
gillespie
three
weeks
ago
you
used
to
say
that
you
liked
me
because
i
was
so
blasé
so
indifferent
i
still
am
rosalind
but
not
about
me
i
used
to
like
you
because
you
had
brown
eyes
and
thin
legs
gillespie
helplessly
they
still
thin
and
brown
you
a
vampire
that
all
rosalind
the
only
thing
i
know
about
vamping
is
what
on
the
piano
score
what
confuses
men
is
that
i
perfectly
natural
i
used
to
think
you
were
never
jealous
now
you
follow
me
with
your
eyes
wherever
i
go
gillespie
i
love
you
rosalind
coldly
i
know
it
gillespie
and
you
have
kissed
me
for
two
weeks
i
had
an
idea
that
after
a
girl
was
kissed
she
was
was
won
rosalind
those
days
are
over
i
have
to
be
won
all
over
again
every
time
you
see
me
gillespie
are
you
serious
rosalind
about
as
usual
there
used
to
be
two
kinds
of
kisses
first
when
girls
were
kissed
and
deserted
second
when
they
were
engaged
now
there
a
third
kind
where
the
man
is
kissed
and
deserted
if
jones
of
the
nineties
bragged
he
kissed
a
girl
every
one
knew
he
was
through
with
her
if
jones
of
brags
the
same
every
one
knows
it
because
he
ca
kiss
her
any
more
given
a
decent
start
any
girl
can
beat
a
man
nowadays
gillespie
then
why
do
you
play
with
men
rosalind
leaning
forward
confidentially
for
that
first
moment
when
he
interested
there
is
a
moment
oh
just
before
the
first
kiss
a
whispered
word
something
that
makes
it
worth
while
gillespie
and
then
rosalind
then
after
that
you
make
him
talk
about
himself
pretty
soon
he
thinks
of
nothing
but
being
alone
with
you
he
sulks
he
wo
fight
he
does
want
to
play
victory

been
there
it
in
the
the
middle
west
is
it
amory
spicily
approximately
but
i
always
felt
that
i
rather
be
provincial
than
soup
without
seasoning
gillespie
what
amory
oh
no
offense
gillespie
bows
and
leaves
rosalind
he
too
much
amory
i

in
love
with
a
once
rosalind
so
amory
oh
yes
her
name
was
isabelle
nothing
at
all
to
her
except
what
i
read
into
her
rosalind
what
happened
amory
finally
i
convinced
her
that
she
was
smarter
than
i
was
then
she
threw
me
over
said
i
was
critical
and
impractical
you
know
rosalind
what
do
you
mean
impractical
amory
oh
drive
a
car
but
ca
change
a
tire
rosalind
what
are
you
going
to
do
amory
ca
say

rosalind
greenwich
village
amory
good
heavens
no
i
said
write
not
drink
rosalind
i
like
business
men
clever
men
are
usually
so
homely
amory
i
feel
as
if
i
known
you
for
ages
rosalind
oh
are
you
going
to
commence
the
pyramid
story
amory
no
i
was
going
to
make
it
french
i
was
louis
xiv
and
you
were
one
of
my
my
changing
his
tone
suppose
we
fell
in
love
rosalind
i
suggested
pretending
amory
if
we
did
it
would
be
very
big
rosalind
why
amory
because
selfish
people
are
in
a
way
terribly
capable
of
great
loves
rosalind
turning
her
lips
up
pretend
very
deliberately
they
kiss
amory
i
ca
say
sweet
things
but
you
beautiful
rosalind
not
that
amory
what
then
rosalind
sadly
oh
nothing
only
i
want
sentiment
real
sentiment
and
i
never
find
it
amory
i
never
find
anything
else
in
the
world
and
i
loathe
it
rosalind
it
so
hard
to
find
a
male
to
gratify
one
artistic
taste
some
one
has
opened
a
door
and
the
music
of
a
waltz
surges
into
the
room
rosalind
rises
rosalind
listen
they
playing
kiss
me
he
looks
at
her
amory
well
rosalind
well
amory
softly
the
battle
lost
i
love
you
rosalind
i
love
you
now
they
kiss
amory
oh
god
what
have
i
done
rosalind
nothing
oh
do
talk
kiss
me
again
amory
i
do
know
why
or
how
but
i
love
you
from
the
moment
i
saw
you
rosalind
me
too
i
i
oh
her
brother
strolls
in
starts
and
then
in
a
loud
voice
says
oh
excuse
me
and
goes
rosalind
her
lips
scarcely
stirring
do
let
me
go
i
do
care
who
knows
what
i
do
amory
say

rosalind
i
love
you
now

part
oh
i
am
very
youthful
thank
god
and
rather
beautiful
thank
god
and
happy
thank
god
thank
god
she
pauses
and
then
in
an
odd
burst
of
prophecy
adds
poor
amory
he
kisses
her
again
kismet
within
two
weeks
amory
and
rosalind
were
deeply
and
passionately
in
love
the
critical
qualities
which
had
spoiled
for
each
of
them
a
dozen
romances
were
dulled
by
the
great
wave
of
emotion
that
washed
over
them
it
may
be
an
insane
she
told
her
anxious
mother
but
it
not
the
wave
swept
amory
into
an
advertising
agency
early
in
march
where
he
alternated
between
astonishing
bursts
of
rather
exceptional
work
and
wild
dreams
of
becoming
suddenly
rich
and
touring
italy
with
rosalind
they
were
together
constantly
for
lunch
for
dinner
and
nearly
every
evening
always
in
a
sort
of
breathless
hush
as
if
they
feared
that
any
minute
the
spell
would
break
and
drop
them
out
of
this
paradise
of
rose
and
flame
but
the
spell
became
a
trance
seemed
to
increase
from
day
to
day
they
began
to
talk
of
marrying
in
july
in
june
all
life
was
transmitted
into
terms
of
their
love
all
experience
all
desires
all
ambitions
were
nullified
their
senses
of
humor
crawled
into
corners
to
sleep
their
former
seemed
faintly
laughable
and
scarcely
regretted
juvenalia
for
the
second
time
in
his
life
amory
had
had
a
complete
bouleversement
and
was
hurrying
into
line
with
his
generation
a
little
interlude
amory
wandered
slowly
up
the
avenue
and
thought
of
the
night
as
inevitably
his
the
pageantry
and
carnival
of
rich
dusk
and
dim
streets
it
seemed
that
he
had
closed
the
book
of
fading
harmonies
at
last
and
stepped
into
the
sensuous
vibrant
walks
of
life
everywhere
these
countless
lights
this
promise
of
a
night
of
streets
and
singing
he
moved
in
a
through
the
crowd
as
if
expecting
to
meet
rosalind
hurrying
toward
him
with
eager
feet
from
every
corner
how
the
unforgettable
faces
of
dusk
would
blend
to
her
the
myriad
footsteps
a
thousand
overtures
would
blend
to
her
footsteps
and
there
would
be
more
drunkenness
than
wine
in
the
softness
of
her
eyes
on
his
even
his
dreams
now
were
faint
violins
drifting
like
summer
sounds
upon
the
summer
air
the
room
was
in
darkness
except
for
the
faint
glow
of
tom
cigarette
where
he
lounged
by
the
open
window
as
the
door
shut
behind
him
amory
stood
a
moment
with
his
back
against
it
hello
benvenuto
blaine
how
went
the
advertising
business
amory
sprawled
on
a
couch
i
loathed
it
as
usual
the
momentary
vision
of
the
bustling
agency
was
displaced
quickly
by
another
picture
my
god
she
wonderful
tom
sighed
i
ca
tell
you
repeated
amory
just
how
wonderful
she
is
i
want
you
to
know
i
do
want
any
one
to
another
sigh
came
from
the
window
quite
a
resigned
sigh
she
life
and
hope
and
happiness
my
whole
world
he
felt
the
quiver
of
a
tear
on
his
eyelid
oh
tom
bitter
sweet
sit
like
we
do
she
whispered
he
sat
in
the
big
chair
and
held
out
his
arms
so
that
she
could
nestle
inside
them
i
knew
you
come
she
said
softly
like
summer
just
when
i
needed
you
most
darling
darling
his
lips
moved
lazily
over
her
face
you
so
good
he
sighed
how
do
you
mean
lover
oh
just
sweet
just
sweet
he
held
her
closer
amory
she
whispered
when
you
ready
for
me
i
marry
we
wo
have
much
at
do
she
cried
it
hurts
when
you
reproach
yourself
for
what
you
ca
give
me
i
got
your
precious
self
and
that
enough
for
tell
me
you
know
do
you
oh
you
yes
but
i
want
to
hear
you
say
i
love
you
amory
with
all
my
always
will
you
all
my
life
oh
amory
what
i
want
to
belong
to
you
i
want
your
people
to
be
my
people
i
want
to
have
your
but
i
have
any
do
laugh
at
me
amory
just
kiss
i
do
what
you
want
he
said
no
i
do
what
want
we
not
me
oh
you
so
much
a
part
so
much
all
of
me
he
closed
his
eyes
i
so
happy
that
i
frightened
would
it
be
awful
if
this
was
was
the
high
point
she
looked
at
him
dreamily
beauty
and
love
pass
i
know
oh
there
sadness
too
i
suppose
all
great
happiness
is
a
little
sad
beauty
means
the
scent
of
roses
and
then
the
death
of
roses
beauty
means
the
agony
of
sacrifice
and
the
end
of
agony
and
amory
we
beautiful
i
know
i
sure
god
loves
us
he
loves
you
you
his
most
precious
i
not
his
i
yours
amory
i
belong
to
you
for
the
first
time
i
regret
all
the
other
kisses
now
i
know
how
much
a
kiss
can
then
they
would
smoke
and
he
would
tell
her
about
his
day
at
the
office
and
where
they
might
live
sometimes
when
he
was
particularly
loquacious
she
went
to
sleep
in
his
arms
but
he
loved
that
rosalind
all
rosalinds
as
he
had
never
in
the
world
loved
any
one
else
intangibly
fleeting
unrememberable
hours
aquatic
incident
one
day
amory
and
howard
gillespie
meeting
by
accident
took
lunch
together
and
amory
heard
a
story
that
delighted
him
gillespie
after
several
cocktails
was
in
a
talkative
mood
he
began
by
telling
amory
that
he
was
sure
rosalind
was
slightly
eccentric
he
had
gone
with
her
on
a
swimming
party
up
in
westchester
county
and
some
one
mentioned
that
annette
kellerman
had
been
there
one
day
on
a
visit
and
had
dived
from
the
top
of
a
rickety
immediately
rosalind
insisted
that
howard
should
climb
up
with
her
to
see
what
it
looked
like
a
minute
later
as
he
sat
and
dangled
his
feet
on
the
edge
a
form
shot
by
him
rosalind
her
arms
spread
in
a
beautiful
swan
dive
had
sailed
through
the
air
into
the
clear
water
of
course
had
to
go
after
that
and
i
nearly
killed
myself
i
thought
i
was
pretty
good
to
even
try
it
nobody
else
in
the
party
tried
it
well
afterward
rosalind
had
the
nerve
to
ask
me
why
i
stooped
over
when
i
dove
did
make
it
any
easier
she
said
just
took
all
the
courage
out
of
it
i
ask
you
what
can
a
man
do
with
a
girl
like
that
unnecessary
i
call
gillespie
failed
to
understand
why
amory
was
smiling
delightedly
all
through
lunch
he
thought
perhaps
he
was
one
of
these
hollow
optimists
five
weeks
later
again
the
library
of
the
connage
house
rosalind
is
alone
sitting
on
the
lounge
staring
very
moodily
and
unhappily
at
nothing
she
has
changed
perceptibly
she
is
a
trifle
thinner
for
one
thing
the
light
in
her
eyes
is
not
so
bright
she
looks
easily
a
year
older
her
mother
comes
in
muffled
in
an
she
takes
in
rosalind
with
a
nervous
glance
connage
who
is
coming
rosalind
fails
to
hear
her
at
least
takes
no
notice
connage
alec
is
coming
up
to
take
me
to
this
barrie
play
et
tu
she
perceives
that
she
is
talking
to
herself
rosalind
i
asked
you
who
is
coming
rosalind
starting
oh
what
oh
amory
connage
sarcastically
you
have
so
admirers
lately
that
i
could
imagine
one
rosalind
does
answer
dawson
ryder
is
more
patient
than
i
thought
he
be
you
have
given
him
an
evening
this
week
rosalind
with
a
very
weary
expression
that
is
quite
new
to
her
face
mother
please
connage
oh
wo
interfere
you
already
wasted
over
two
months
on
a
theoretical
genius
who
has
a
penny
to
his
name
but
ahead
waste
your
life
on
him
wo
interfere
rosalind
as
if
repeating
a
tiresome
lesson
you
know
he
has
a
little
income
and
you
know
he
earning
dollars
a
week
in
advertising
connage
and
it
would
buy
your
clothes
she
pauses
but
rosalind
makes
no
reply
i
have
your
best
interests
at
heart
when
i
tell
you
not
to
take
a
step
you
spend
your
days
regretting
it
not
as
if
your
father
could
help
you
things
have
been
hard
for
him
lately
and
he
an
old
man
you
be
dependent
absolutely
on
a
dreamer
a
nice
boy
but
a
dreamer
merely
she
implies
that
this
quality
in
itself
is
rather
vicious
rosalind
for
heaven
sake
mother
a
maid
appears
announces
blaine
who
follows
immediately
friends
have
been
telling
him
for
ten
days
that
he
looks
like
the
wrath
of
god
and
he
does
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
has
not
been
able
to
eat
a
mouthful
in
the
last
hours
amory
good
evening

connage
not
unkindly
good
evening
amory
amory
and
rosalind
exchange
glances
and
alec
comes
in
alec
attitude
throughout
has
been
neutral
he
believes
in
his
heart
that
the
marriage
would
make
amory
mediocre
and
rosalind
miserable
but
he
feels
a
great
sympathy
for
both
of
them
alec
hi
amory
amory
hi
alec
tom
said
he

you
at
the
theatre

brilliant
copy
amory
oh

at
him
rather
eagerly
of
two
dollars
a
week
general

i
hear
the
car
a
good
night
rather
chilly
in
sections
after
connage
and
alec
go
out
there
is
a
pause
rosalind
still
stares
moodily
at
the
fireplace
amory
goes
to
her
and
puts
his
arm
around
her
amory
darling
girl
they
kiss
another
pause
and
then
she
seizes
his
hand
covers
it
with
kisses
and
holds
it
to
her
breast
rosalind
sadly
i
love
your
hands
more
than
anything
i
see
them
often
when
you
away
from
me
so
tired
i
know
every
line
of
them
dear
hands
their
eyes
meet
for
a
second
and
then
she
begins
to
cry
a
tearless
sobbing
amory
rosalind
rosalind
oh
we
so
darned
pitiful
amory
rosalind
rosalind
oh

this
way
four
days
now
you
got
to
be
more
encouraging
or
i
ca
work
or
eat
or
sleep
he
looks
around
helplessly
as
if
searching
for
new
words
to
clothe
an
old
shopworn
phrase
we
have
to
make
a
start
i
like
having
to
make
a
start
together
his
forced
hopefulness
fades
as
he
sees
her
unresponsive
what
the
matter
he
gets
up
suddenly
and
starts
to
pace
the
floor
it
dawson
ryder
that
what
it
is
he
been
working
on
your
nerves
you
been
with
him
every
afternoon
for
a
week
people
come
and
tell
me
they
seen
you
together
and
i
have
to
smile
and
nod
and
pretend
it
has
the
slightest
significance
for
me
and
you
wo
tell
me
anything
as
it
develops
rosalind
amory
if
you
do
sit
down
i
scream
amory

down
suddenly
beside

as
if
we
going
to
have
each
other
she
cries
a
little
and
rising
from
the
couch
goes
to
the
armchair
i
felt
all
afternoon
that
things
were
worse

nearly
went
wild

at
the
office

write
a
line

me
everything

to

for

him
throw
back
his
head
and
he
is
gone
gone
she
half
starts
from
the
lounge
and
then
sinks
forward
on
her
face
into
the
pillows
rosalind
oh
god
i
want
to
die
after
a
moment
she
rises
and
with
her
eyes
closed
feels
her
way
to
the
door
then
she
turns
and
looks
once
more
at
the
room
here
they
had
sat
and
dreamed
that
tray
she
had
so
often
filled
with
matches
for
him
that
shade
that
they
had
discreetly
lowered
one
long
sunday
afternoon
she
stands
and
remembers
she
speaks
aloud
oh
amory
what
have
i
done
to
you
and
deep
under
the
aching
sadness
that
will
pass
in
time
rosalind
feels
that
she
has
lost
something
she

stopped
in
the
entrance
and
looked
at
his
he
wanted
particularly
to
know
the
time
for
something
in
his
mind
that
catalogued
and
classified
liked
to
chip
things
off
cleanly
later
it
would
satisfy
him
in
a
vague
way
to
be
able
to
think
that
thing
ended
at
exactly
twenty
minutes
after
eight
on
thursday
june
this
was
allowing
for
the
walk
from
her
house
a
walk
concerning
which
he
had
afterward
not
the
faintest
recollection
he
was
in
rather
grotesque
condition
two
days
of
worry
and
nervousness
of
sleepless
nights
of
untouched
meals
culminating
in
the
emotional
crisis
and
rosalind
abrupt
decision
the
strain
of
it
had
drugged
the
foreground
of
his
mind
into
a
merciful
coma
as
he
fumbled
clumsily
with
the
olives
at
the
table
a
man
approached
and
spoke
to
him
and
the
olives
dropped
from
his
nervous
hands
well
amory
it
was
some
one
he
had
known
at
princeton
he
had
no
idea
of
the
name
hello
old
boy
he
heard
himself
saying
name
jim
wilson
you
sure
you
bet
jim
i
going
to
reunion
you
know
simultaneously
he
realized
that
he
was
not
going
to
reunion
get
overseas
amory
nodded
his
eyes
staring
oddly
stepping
back
to
let
some
one
pass
he
knocked
the
dish
of
olives
to
a
crash
on
the
floor
too
bad
he
muttered
have
a
drink
wilson
ponderously
diplomatic
reached
over
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
you
had
plenty
old
amory
eyed
him
dumbly
until
wilson
grew
embarrassed
under
the
scrutiny
plenty
hell
said
amory
finally
i
have
had
a
drink
wilson
looked
incredulous

by

of
amory
his
head
spinning
gorgeously
layer
upon
layer
of
soft
satisfaction
setting
over
the
bruised
spots
of
his
spirit
was
discoursing
volubly
on
the

a
mental
he
insisted
with
wisdom

he
expressed
his
lack
of
principle
by
sweeping
a
seltzer
bottle
with
a
broad
gesture
to
noisy
extinction
on
the
floor
but
this
did
not
interrupt
his
speech

he
became
so
emphatic
in
impressing
on

the
fact
that
he
did
wonder
that
he
lost
the
thread
of
his
discourse
and
concluded
by
announcing
to
the
bar
at
large
that
he
was
a
physcal
what
are

celebrating

amory
leaned
forward
confidentially
blowmylife
great
moment
blow
my
life
ca
tell
you
it
he
heard
carling
addressing
a
remark
to
the
bartender
give
him
a
amory
shook
his
head
indignantly
none
that
stuff
but
listen
amory
you
making
yourself
sick
you
white
as
a
amory
considered
the
question
he
tried
to
look
at
himself
in
the
mirror
but
even
by
squinting
up
one
eye
could
only
see
as
far
as
the
row
of
bottles
behind
the
bar
like
solid
we
go
get
some
some
he
settled
his
coat
with
an
attempt
at
nonchalance
but
letting
go
of
the
bar
was
too
much
for
him
and
he
slumped
against
a
chair
we
go
over
to
shanley
suggested
carling
offering
an
elbow
with
this
assistance
amory
managed
to
get
his
legs
in
motion
enough
to
propel
him
across
street
shanley
was
very
dim
he
was
conscious
that
he
was
talking
in
a
loud
voice
very
succinctly
and
convincingly
he
thought
about
a
desire
to
crush
people
under
his
heel
he
consumed
three
club
sandwiches
devouring
each
as
though
it
were
no
larger
than
a
then
rosalind
began
popping
into
his
mind
again
and
he
found
his
lips
forming
her
name
over
and
over
next
he
was
sleepy
and
he
had
a
hazy
listless
sense
of
people
in
dress
suits
probably
waiters
gathering
around
the
table
he
was
in
a
room
and
carling
was
saying
something
about
a
knot
in
his
nemmine
he
managed
to
articulate
drowsily
sleep
in
still
alcoholic
he
awoke
laughing
and
his
eyes
lazily
roamed
his
surroundings
evidently
a
bedroom
and
bath
in
a
good
hotel
his
head
was
whirring
and
picture
after
picture
was
forming
and
blurring
and
melting
before
his
eyes
but
beyond
the
desire
to
laugh
he
had
no
entirely
conscious
reaction
he
reached
for
the
beside
his
bed
hello
what
hotel
is
this
knickerbocker
all
right
send
up
two
rye
he
lay
for
a
moment
and
wondered
idly
whether
they
send
up
a
bottle
or
just
two
of
those
little
glass
containers
then
with
an
effort
he
struggled
out
of
bed
and
ambled
into
the
bathroom
when
he
emerged
rubbing
himself
lazily
with
a
towel
he
found
the
bar
boy
with
the
drinks
and
had
a
sudden
desire
to
kid
him
on
reflection
he
decided
that
this
would
be
undignified
so
he
waved
him
away
as
the
new
alcohol
tumbled
into
his
stomach
and
warmed
him
the
isolated
pictures
began
slowly
to
form
a
cinema
reel
of
the
day
before
again
he
saw
rosalind
curled
weeping
among
the
pillows
again
he
felt
her
tears
against
his
cheek
her
words
began
ringing
in
his
ears
do
ever
forget
me
amory
do
ever
forget
me
hell
he
faltered
aloud
and
then
he
choked
and
collapsed
on
the
bed
in
a
shaken
spasm
of
grief
after
a
minute
he
opened
his
eyes
and
regarded
the
ceiling
damned
fool
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
and
with
a
voluminous
sigh
rose
and
approached
the
bottle
after
another
glass
he
gave
way
loosely
to
the
luxury
of
tears
purposely
he
called
up
into
his
mind
little
incidents
of
the
vanished
spring
phrased
to
himself
emotions
that
would
make
him
react
even
more
strongly
to
sorrow
we
were
so
happy
he
intoned
dramatically
so
very
then
he
gave
way
again
and
knelt
beside
the
bed
his
head
in
the
pillow
my
own
girl
my
own
oh
he
clinched
his
teeth
so
that
the
tears
streamed
in
a
flood
from
his
eyes
oh
my
baby
girl
all
i
had
all
i
wanted
oh
my
girl
come
back
come
back
i
need
you
need
you
we
so
pitiful
just
misery
we
brought
each
other
she
be
shut
away
from
me
i
ca
see
her
i
ca
be
her
friend
it
got
to
be
that
way
it
got
to
be
and
then
again
we
been
so
happy
so
very
happy
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
threw
himself
on
the
bed
in
an
ecstasy
of
sentiment
and
then
lay
exhausted
while
he
realized
slowly
that
he
had
been
very
drunk
the
night
before
and
that
his
head
was
spinning
again
wildly
he
laughed
rose
and
crossed
again
to
lethe
at
noon
he
ran
into
a
crowd
in
the
biltmore
bar
and
the
riot
began
again
he
had
a
vague
recollection
afterward
of
discussing
french
poetry
with
a
british
officer
who
was
introduced
to
him
as
captain
corn
of
his
majesty
foot
and
he
remembered
attempting
to
recite
clair
de
lune
at
luncheon
then
he
slept
in
a
big
soft
chair
until
almost
five
when
another
crowd
found
and
woke
him
there
followed
an
alcoholic
dressing
of
several
temperaments
for
the
ordeal
of
dinner
they
selected
theatre
tickets
at
tyson
for
a
play
that
had
a
programme
a
play
with
two
monotonous
voices
with
turbid
gloomy
scenes
and
lighting
effects
that
were
hard
to
follow
when
his
eyes
behaved
so
amazingly
he
imagined
afterward
that
it
must
have
been
the
then
the
cocoanut
grove
where
amory
slept
again
on
a
little
balcony
outside
out
in
shanley
yonkers
he
became
almost
logical
and
by
a
careful
control
of
the
number
of
he
drank
grew
quite
lucid
and
garrulous
he
found
that
the
party
consisted
of
five
men
two
of
whom
he
knew
slightly
he
became
righteous
about
paying
his
share
of
the
expense
and
insisted
in
a
loud
voice
on
arranging
everything
then
and
there
to
the
amusement
of
the
tables
around
him
some
one
mentioned
that
a
famous
cabaret
star
was
at
the
next
table
so
amory
rose
and
approaching
gallantly
introduced
himself
this
involved
him
in
an
argument
first
with
her
escort
and
then
with
the
headwaiter
amory
attitude
being
a
lofty
and
exaggerated
courtesy
he
consented
after
being
confronted
with
irrefutable
logic
to
being
led
back
to
his
own
table
decided
to
commit
suicide
he
announced
suddenly
when
next
year
now
morning
going
to
take
a
room
at
the
commodore
get
into
a
hot
bath
and
open
a
he
getting
morbid
you
need
another
rye
old
boy
we
all
talk
it
over
but
amory
was
not
to
be
dissuaded
from
argument
at
least
did
you
ever
get
that
way
he
demanded
confidentially
fortaccio
sure
often
my
chronic
this
provoked
discussion
one
man
said
that
he
got
so
depressed
sometimes
that
he
seriously
considered
it
another
agreed
that
there
was
nothing
to
live
for
captain
corn
who
had
somehow
rejoined
the
party
said
that
in
his
opinion
it
was
when
one
health
was
bad
that
one
felt
that
way
most
amory
suggestion
was
that
they
should
each
order
a
bronx
mix
broken
glass
in
it
and
drink
it
off
to
his
relief
no
one
applauded
the
idea
so
having
finished
his
he
balanced
his
chin
in
his
hand
and
his
elbow
on
the
table
a
most
delicate
scarcely
noticeable
sleeping
position
he
assured
himself
and
went
into
a
deep
stupor
he
was
awakened
by
a
woman
clinging
to
him
a
pretty
woman
with
brown
disarranged
hair
and
dark
blue
eyes
take
me
home
she
cried
hello
said
amory
blinking
i
like
you
she
announced
tenderly
i
like
you
he
noticed
that
there
was
a
noisy
man
in
the
background
and
that
one
of
his
party
was
arguing
with
him
fella
i
was
with
a
damn
fool
confided
the
woman
i
hate
him
i
want
to
go
home
with
you
drunk
queried
amory
with
intense
wisdom
she
nodded
coyly
go
home
with
him
he
advised
gravely
he
brought
at
this
point
the
noisy
man
in
the
background
broke
away
from
his
detainers
and
approached
say
he
said
fiercely
i
brought
this
girl
out
here
and
butting
in
amory
regarded
him
coldly
while
the
girl
clung
to
him
closer
you
let
go
that
girl
cried
the
noisy
man
amory
tried
to
make
his
eyes
threatening
you
go
to
hell
he
directed
finally
and
turned
his
attention
to
the
girl
love
first
sight
he
suggested
i
love
you
she
breathed
and
nestled
close
to
him
she
have
beautiful
eyes
some
one
leaned
over
and
spoke
in
amory
ear
that
just
margaret
diamond
she
drunk
and
this
fellow
here
brought
her
better
let
her
let
him
take
care
of
her
then
shouted
amory
furiously
i
no
worker
am
i
am
i
let
her
go
it
hanging
on
damn
it
let
her
hang
the
crowd
around
the
table
thickened
for
an
instant
a
brawl
threatened
but
a
sleek
waiter
bent
back
margaret
diamond
fingers
until
she
released
her
hold
on
amory
whereupon
she
slapped
the
waiter
furiously
in
the
face
and
flung
her
arms
about
her
raging
original
escort
oh
lord
cried
amory
let
go
come
on
the
taxis
are
getting
scarce
check
amory
your
romance
is
amory
laughed
you
do
know
how
true
you
spoke
no
idea
the
whole
amory
on
the
labor
question
two
mornings
later
he
knocked
at
the
president
door
at
bascome
and
barlow
advertising
agency
come
in
amory
entered
unsteadily
barlow
brought
his
glasses
to
the
inspection
and
set
his
mouth
slightly
ajar
that
he
might
better
listen
well
blaine
we
have
seen
you
for
several
no
said
amory
i
well
well
this
is
i
do
like
it
i
sorry
i
thought
our
relations
had
been
quite
ah
pleasant
you
seemed
to
be
a
hard
worker
a
little
inclined
perhaps
to
write
fancy
copy
i
just
got
tired
of
it
interrupted
amory
rudely
it
did
matter
a
damn
to
me
whether
harebell
flour
was
any
better
than
any
one
else
in
fact
i
never
ate
any
of
it
so
i
got
tired
of
telling
people
about
it
oh
i
know
i
been
drinking
barlow
face
steeled
by
several
ingots
of
expression
you
asked
for
a
position
amory
waved
him
to
silence
and
i
think
i
was
rottenly
underpaid
dollars
a
week
less
than
a
good
you
had
just
started
you
never
worked
before
said
barlow
coolly
but
it
took
about
ten
thousand
dollars
to
educate
me
where
i
could
write
your
darned
stuff
for
you
anyway
as
far
as
length
of
service
goes
you
got
stenographers
here
you
paid
fifteen
a
week
for
five
i
not
going
to
argue
with
you
sir
said
barlow
rising
neither
am
i
just
wanted
to
tell
you
i
they
stood
for
a
moment
looking
at
each
other
impassively
and
then
amory
turned
and
left
the
office
a
little
lull
four
days
after
that
he
returned
at
last
to
the
apartment
tom
was
engaged
on
a
book
review
for
the
new
democracy
on
the
staff
of
which
he
was
employed
they
regarded
each
other
for
a
moment
in
silence
well
well
good
lord
amory
where
you
get
the
black
eye
and
the
jaw
amory
laughed
that
a
mere
he
peeled
off
his
coat
and
bared
his
shoulders
look
here
tom
emitted
a
low
whistle
what
hit
you
amory
laughed
again
oh
a
lot
of
people
i
got
beaten
up
he
slowly
replaced
his
shirt
it
was
bound
to
come
sooner
or
later
and
i
would
have
missed
it
for
who
was
it
well
there
were
some
waiters
and
a
couple
of
sailors
and
a
few
stray
pedestrians
i
guess
it
the
strangest
feeling
you
ought
to
get
beaten
up
just
for
the
experience
of
it
you
fall
down
after
a
while
and
everybody
sort
of
slashes
in
at
you
before
you
hit
the
ground
then
they
kick
tom
lighted
a
cigarette
i
spent
a
day
chasing
you
all
over
town
amory
but
you
always
kept
a
little
ahead
of
me
i
say
you
been
on
some
amory
tumbled
into
a
chair
and
asked
for
a
cigarette
you
sober
now
asked
tom
quizzically
pretty
sober
why
well
alec
has
left
his
family
had
been
after
him
to
go
home
and
live
so
he
a
spasm
of
pain
shook
amory
too
yes
it
is
too
bad
we
have
to
get
some
one
else
if
we
going
to
stay
here
the
rent
going
sure
get
anybody
i
leave
it
to
you
amory
walked
into
his
bedroom
the
first
thing
that
met
his
glance
was
a
photograph
of
rosalind
that
he
had
intended
to
have
framed
propped
up
against
a
mirror
on
his
dresser
he
looked
at
it
unmoved
after
the
vivid
mental
pictures
of
her
that
were
his
portion
at
present
the
portrait
was
curiously
unreal
he
went
back
into
the
study
got
a
cardboard
box
no
answered
tom
puzzled
why
should
i
have
oh
yes
there
may
be
one
in
alec
eventually
amory
found
what
he
was
looking
for
and
returning
to
his
dresser
opened
a
drawer
full
of
letters
notes
part
of
a
chain
two
little
handkerchiefs
and
some
as
he
transferred
them
carefully
to
the
box
his
mind
wandered
to
some
place
in
a
book
where
the
hero
after
preserving
for
a
year
a
cake
of
his
lost
love
soap
finally
washed
his
hands
with
it
he
laughed
and
began
to
hum
after
you
gone
ceased
abruptly
the
string
broke
twice
and
then
he
managed
to
secure
it
dropped
the
package
into
the
bottom
of
his
trunk
and
having
slammed
the
lid
returned
to
the
study
going
out
tom
voice
held
an
undertone
of
anxiety
where
could
say
old
let
have
dinner
sorry
i
told
sukey
brett
i
eat
with
amory
crossed
the
street
and
had
a
then
he
walked
to
washington
square
and
found
a
top
seat
on
a
bus
he
disembarked
at
street
and
strolled
to
the
biltmore
bar
hi
amory
what
you
have
waiter
temperature
normal
the
advent
of
prohibition
with
the
put
a
sudden
stop
to
the
submerging
of
amory
sorrows
and
when
he
awoke
one
morning
to
find
that
the
old
days
were
over
he
had
neither
remorse
for
the
past
three
weeks
nor
regret
that
their
repetition
was
impossible
he
had
taken
the
most
violent
if
the
weakest
method
to
shield
himself
from
the
stabs
of
memory
and
while
it
was
not
a
course
he
would
have
prescribed
for
others
he
found
in
the
end
that
it
had
done
its
business
he
was
over
the
first
flush
of
pain
do
misunderstand
amory
had
loved
rosalind
as
he
would
never
love
another
living
person
she
had
taken
the
first
flush
of
his
youth
and
brought
from
his
unplumbed
depths
tenderness
that
had
surprised
him
gentleness
and
unselfishness
that
he
had
never
given
to
another
creature
he
had
later
but
of
a
different
sort
in
those
he
went
back
to
that
perhaps
more
typical
frame
of
mind
in
which
the
girl
became
the
mirror
of
a
mood
in
him
rosalind
had
drawn
out
what
was
more
than
passionate
admiration
he
had
a
deep
undying
affection
for
rosalind
but
there
had
been
near
the
end
so
much
dramatic
tragedy
culminating
in
the
arabesque
nightmare
of
his
three
weeks
spree
that
he
was
emotionally
worn
out
the
people
and
surroundings
that
he
remembered
as
being
cool
or
delicately
artificial
seemed
to
promise
him
a
refuge
he
wrote
a
cynical
story
which
featured
his
father
funeral
and
despatched
it
to
a
magazine
receiving
in
return
a
check
for
sixty
dollars
and
a
request
for
more
of
the
same
tone
this
tickled
his
vanity
but
inspired
him
to
no
further
effort
he
read
enormously
he
was
puzzled
and
depressed
by
a
portrait
of
the
artist
as
a
young
man
intensely
interested
by
joan
and
peter
and
the
undying
fire
and
rather
surprised
by
his
discovery
through
a
critic
named
mencken
of
several
excellent
american
novels
vandover
and
the
brute
the
damnation
of
theron
ware
and
jennie
mackenzie
chesterton
galsworthy
bennett
had
sunk
in
his
appreciation
from
sagacious
geniuses
to
merely
diverting
contemporaries
shaw
aloof
clarity
and
brilliant
consistency
and
the
gloriously
intoxicated
efforts
of
wells
to
fit
the
key
of
romantic
symmetry
into
the
elusive
lock
of
truth
alone
won
his
rapt
attention
he
wanted
to
see
monsignor
darcy
to
whom
he
had
written
when
he
landed
but
he
had
not
heard
from
him
besides
he
knew
that
a
visit
to
monsignor
would
entail
the
story
of
rosalind
and
the
thought
of
repeating
it
turned
him
cold
with
horror
in
his
search
for
cool
people
he
remembered
lawrence
a
very
intelligent
very
dignified
lady
a
convert
to
the
church
and
a
great
devotee
of
monsignor
he
called
her
on
the
one
day
yes
she
remembered
him
perfectly
no
monsignor
was
in
town
was
in
boston
she
thought
he
promised
to
come
to
dinner
when
he
returned
could
amory
take
luncheon
with
her
i
thought
i
better
catch
up
lawrence
he
said
rather
ambiguously
when
he
arrived
monsignor
was
here
just
last
week
said
lawrence
regretfully
he
was
very
anxious
to
see
you
but
he
left
your
address
at
did
he
think
i
plunged
into
bolshevism
asked
amory
interested
oh
he
having
a
frightful
why
about
the
irish
republic
he
thinks
it
lacks
so
he
went
to
boston
when
the
irish
president
arrived
and
he
was
greatly
distressed
because
the
receiving
committee
when
they
rode
in
an
automobile
put
their
arms
around
the
i
do
blame
well
what
impressed
you
more
than
anything
while
you
were
in
the
army
you
look
a
great
deal
that
from
another
more
disastrous
battle
he
answered
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
but
the
army
let
me
see
well
i
discovered
that
physical
courage
depends
to
a
great
extent
on
the
physical
shape
a
man
is
in
i
found
that
i
was
as
brave
as
the
next
man
it
used
to
worry
me
what
else
well
the
idea
that
men
can
stand
anything
if
they
get
used
to
it
and
the
fact
that
i
got
a
high
mark
in
the
psychological
lawrence
laughed
amory
was
finding
it
a
great
relief
to
be
in
this
cool
house
on
riverside
drive
away
from
more
condensed
new
york
and
the
sense
of
people
expelling
great
quantities
of
breath
into
a
little
space
lawrence
reminded
him
vaguely
of
beatrice
not
in
temperament
but
in
her
perfect
grace
and
dignity
the
house
its
furnishings
the
manner
in
which
dinner
was
served
were
in
immense
contrast
to
what
he
had
met
in
the
great
places
on
long
island
where
the
servants
were
so
obtrusive
that
they
had
positively
to
be
bumped
out
of
the
way
or
even
in
the
houses
of
more
conservative
union
club
families
he
wondered
if
this
air
of
symmetrical
restraint
this
grace
which
he
felt
was
continental
was
distilled
through
lawrence
new
england
ancestry
or
acquired
in
long
residence
in
italy
and
spain
two
glasses
of
sauterne
at
luncheon
loosened
his
tongue
and
he
talked
with
what
he
felt
was
something
of
his
old
charm
of
religion
and
literature
and
the
menacing
phenomena
of
the
social
order
lawrence
was
ostensibly
pleased
with
him
and
her
interest
was
especially
in
his
mind
he
wanted
people
to
like
his
mind
again
after
a
while
it
might
be
such
a
nice
place
in
which
to
live
monsignor
darcy
still
thinks
that
you
his
reincarnation
that
your
faith
will
eventually
perhaps
he
assented
i
rather
pagan
at
present
it
just
that
religion
does
seem
to
have
the
slightest
bearing
on
life
at
my
when
he
left
her
house
he
walked
down
riverside
drive
with
a
feeling
of
satisfaction
it
was
amusing
to
discuss
again
such
subjects
as
this
young
poet
stephen
vincent
benet
or
the
irish
republic
between
the
rancid
accusations
of
edward
carson
and
justice
cohalan
he
had
completely
tired
of
the
irish
question
yet
there
had
been
a
time
when
his
own
celtic
traits
were
pillars
of
his
personal
philosophy
there
seemed
suddenly
to
be
much
left
in
life
if
only
this
revival
of
old
interests
did
not
mean
that
he
was
backing
away
from
it
again
backing
away
from
life
itself
restlessness
i
tres
old
and
tres
bored
tom
said
amory
one
day
stretching
himself
at
ease
in
the
comfortable
he
always
felt
most
natural
in
a
recumbent
position
you
used
to
be
entertaining
before
you
started
to
write
he
continued
now
you
save
any
idea
that
you
think
would
do
to
existence
had
settled
back
to
an
ambitionless
normality
they
had
decided
that
with
economy
they
could
still
afford
the
apartment
which
tom
with
the
domesticity
of
an
elderly
cat
had
grown
fond
of
the
old
english
hunting
prints
on
the
wall
were
tom
and
the
large
tapestry
by
courtesy
a
relic
of
decadent
days
in
college
and
the
great
profusion
of
orphaned
candlesticks
and
the
carved
louis
xv
chair
in
which
no
one
could
sit
more
than
a
minute
without
acute
spinal
disorders
tom
claimed
that
this
was
because
one
was
sitting
in
the
lap
of
wraith
at
any
rate
it
was
tom
furniture
that
decided
them
to
stay
they
went
out
very
little
to
an
occasional
play
or
to
dinner
at
the
ritz
or
the
princeton
club
with
prohibition
the
great
rendezvous
had
received
their
death
wounds
no
longer
could
one
wander
to
the
biltmore
bar
at
twelve
or
five
and
find
congenial
spirits
and
both
tom
and
amory
had
outgrown
the
passion
for
dancing
with
or
new
jersey
debbies
at
the
surnamed
the
club
de
gink
or
the
plaza
rose
room
besides
even
that
required
several
cocktails
to
come
down
to
the
intellectual
level
of
the
women
present
as
amory
had
once
put
it
to
a
horrified
matron
amory
had
lately
received
several
alarming
letters
from
barton
the
lake
geneva
house
was
too
large
to
be
easily
rented
the
best
rent
obtainable
at
present
would
serve
this
year
to
little
more
than
pay
for
the
taxes
and
necessary
improvements
in
fact
the
lawyer
suggested
that
the
whole
property
was
simply
a
white
elephant
on
amory
hands
nevertheless
even
though
it
might
not
yield
a
cent
for
the
next
three
years
amory
decided
with
a
vague
sentimentality
that
for
the
present
at
any
rate
he
would
not
sell
the
house
this
particular
day
on
which
he
announced
his
ennui
to
tom
had
been
quite
typical
he
had
risen
at
noon
lunched
with
lawrence
and
then
ridden
abstractedly
homeward
atop
one
of
his
beloved
buses
why
should
you
be
bored
yawned
tom
is
that
the
conventional
frame
of
mind
for
the
young
man
of
your
age
and
condition
yes
said
amory
speculatively
but
i
more
than
bored
i
am
love
and
war
did
for
well
amory
considered
i
not
sure
that
the
war
itself
had
any
great
effect
on
either
you
or
me
but
it
certainly
ruined
the
old
backgrounds
sort
of
killed
individualism
out
of
our
tom
looked
up
in
surprise
yes
it
did
insisted
amory
i
not
sure
it
did
kill
it
out
of
the
whole
world
oh
lord
what
a
pleasure
it
used
to
be
to
dream
i
might
be
a
really
great
dictator
or
writer
or
religious
or
political
leader
and
now
even
a
leonardo
da
vinci
or
lorenzo
de
medici
could
be
a
real
bolt
in
the
world
life
is
too
huge
and
complex
the
world
is
so
overgrown
that
it
ca
lift
its
own
fingers
and
i
was
planning
to
be
such
an
important
finger
i
do
agree
with
you
tom
interrupted
there
never
were
men
placed
in
such
egotistic
positions
since
oh
since
the
french
amory
disagreed
violently
you
mistaking
this
period
when
every
nut
is
an
individualist
for
a
period
of
individualism
wilson
has
only
been
powerful
when
he
has
represented
he
had
to
compromise
over
and
over
again
just
as
soon
as
trotsky
and
lenin
take
a
definite
consistent
stand
they
become
merely
figures
like
kerensky
even
foch
has
half
the
significance
of
stonewall
jackson
war
used
to
be
the
most
individualistic
pursuit
of
man
and
yet
the
popular
heroes
of
the
war
had
neither
authority
nor
responsibility
guynemer
and
sergeant
york
how
could
a
schoolboy
make
a
hero
of
pershing
a
big
man
has
no
time
really
to
do
anything
but
just
sit
and
be
then
you
do
think
there
will
be
any
more
permanent
world
heroes
yes
in
history
not
in
life
carlyle
would
have
difficulty
getting
material
for
a
new
chapter
on
hero
as
a
big
man
go
on
i
a
good
listener
people
try
so
hard
to
believe
in
leaders
now
pitifully
hard
but
we
no
sooner
get
a
popular
reformer
or
politician
or
soldier
or
writer
or
philosopher
a
roosevelt
a
tolstoi
a
wood
a
shaw
a
nietzsche
than
the
of
criticism
wash
him
away
my
lord
no
man
can
stand
prominence
these
days
it
the
surest
path
to
obscurity
people
get
sick
of
hearing
the
same
name
over
and
then
you
blame
it
on
the
press
absolutely
look
at
you
you
on
the
new
democracy
considered
the
most
brilliant
weekly
in
the
country
read
by
the
men
who
do
things
and
all
that
what
your
business
why
to
be
as
clever
as
interesting
and
as
brilliantly
cynical
as
possible
about
every
man
doctrine
book
or
policy
that
is
assigned
you
to
deal
with
the
more
strong
lights
the
more
spiritual
scandal
you
can
throw
on
the
matter
the
more
money
they
pay
you
the
more
the
people
buy
the
issue
you
tom
a
blighted
shelley
changing
shifting
clever
unscrupulous
represent
the
critical
consciousness
of
the
race
oh
do
protest
i
know
the
stuff
i
used
to
write
book
reviews
in
college
i
considered
it
rare
sport
to
refer
to
the
latest
honest
conscientious
effort
to
propound
a
theory
or
a
remedy
as
a
addition
to
our
light
summer
reading
come
on
now
admit
tom
laughed
and
amory
continued
triumphantly
we
to
believe
young
students
try
to
believe
in
older
authors
constituents
try
to
believe
in
their
congressmen
countries
try
to
believe
in
their
statesmen
but
they
too
many
voices
too
much
scattered
illogical
criticism
it
worse
in
the
case
of
newspapers
any
rich
unprogressive
old
party
with
that
particularly
grasping
acquisitive
form
of
mentality
known
as
financial
genius
can
own
a
paper
that
is
the
intellectual
meat
and
drink
of
thousands
of
tired
hurried
men
men
too
involved
in
the
business
of
modern
living
to
swallow
anything
but
predigested
food
for
two
cents
the
voter
buys
his
politics
prejudices
and
philosophy
a
year
later
there
is
a
new
political
ring
or
a
change
in
the
paper
ownership
consequence
more
confusion
more
contradiction
a
sudden
inrush
of
new
ideas
their
tempering
their
distillation
the
reaction
against
them
he
paused
only
to
get
his
breath
and
that
is
why
i
have
sworn
not
to
put
pen
to
paper
until
my
ideas
either
clarify
or
depart
entirely
i
have
quite
enough
sins
on
my
soul
without
putting
dangerous
shallow
epigrams
into
people
heads
i
might
cause
a
poor
inoffensive
capitalist
to
have
a
vulgar
liaison
with
a
bomb
or
get
some
innocent
little
bolshevik
tangled
up
with
a
bullet
tom
was
growing
restless
under
this
lampooning
of
his
connection
with
the
new
democracy
what
all
this
got
to
do
with
your
being
bored
amory
considered
that
it
had
much
to
do
with
it
how
i
fit
in
he
demanded
what
am
i
for
to
propagate
the
race
according
to
the
american
novels
we
are
led
to
believe
that
the
american
boy
from
nineteen
to
is
an
entirely
sexless
animal
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
healthier
he
is
the
less
that
true
the
only
alternative
to
letting
it
get
you
is
some
violent
interest
well
the
war
is
over
i
believe
too
much
in
the
responsibilities
of
authorship
to
write
just
now
and
business
well
business
speaks
for
itself
it
has
no
connection
with
anything
in
the
world
that
ever
been
interested
in
except
a
slim
utilitarian
connection
with
economics
what
i
see
of
it
lost
in
a
clerkship
for
the
next
and
best
ten
years
of
my
life
would
have
the
intellectual
content
of
an
industrial
try
fiction
suggested
tom
trouble
is
i
get
distracted
when
i
start
to
write
stories
get
afraid
i
doing
it
instead
of
living
get
thinking
maybe
life
is
waiting
for
me
in
the
japanese
gardens
at
the
ritz
or
at
atlantic
city
or
on
the
lower
east
side
anyway
he
continued
i
have
the
vital
urge
i
wanted
to
be
a
regular
human
being
but
the
girl
could
see
it
that
you
find
god
banish
the
thought
why
do
you
tell
me
that
the
girl
had
been
worth
having
she
have
waited
for
you
no
sir
the
girl
really
worth
having
wo
wait
for
anybody
if
i
thought
there
be
another
lose
my
remaining
faith
in
human
nature
maybe
i
play
but
rosalind
was
the
only
girl
in
the
wide
world
that
could
have
held
well
yawned
tom
i
played
confidant
a
good
hour
by
the
clock
still
i
glad
to
see
you
beginning
to
have
violent
views
again
on
i
am
agreed
amory
reluctantly
yet
when
i
see
a
happy
family
it
makes
me
sick
at
my
stomach
happy
families
try
to
make
people
feel
that
way
said
tom
cynically
tom
the
censor
there
were
days
when
amory
listened
these
were
when
tom
wreathed
in
smoke
indulged
in
the
slaughter
of
american
literature
words
failed
him
fifty
thousand
dollars
a
year
he
would
cry

look
at

this

i
do
tink
he
either
clever
or
amusing
and
what
more
i
do
think
very
many
people
do
except
the
editors
just
groggy
with
advertising
and
oh
harold
bell
wright
oh
zane
grey
they
no
they
do
even
try
some
of
them
write
but
they
wo
sit
down
and
do
one
honest
novel
most
of
them
write
i
admit
i
believe
rupert
hughes
tries
to
give
a
real
comprehensive
picture
of
american
life
but
his
style
and
perspective
are
barbarous
ernest
poole
and
dorothy
canfield
try
but
they
hindered
by
their
absolute
lack
of
any
sense
of
humor
but
at
least
they
crowd
their
work
instead
of
spreading
it
thin
every
author
ought
to
write
every
book
as
if
he
were
going
to
be
beheaded
the
day
he
finished
is
that
double
entente
do
slow
me
up
now
there
a
few
of
that
seem
to
have
some
cultural
background
some
intelligence
and
a
good
deal
of
literary
felicity
but
they
just
simply
wo
write
honestly
they
all
claim
there
was
no
public
for
good
stuff
then
why
the
devil
is
it
that
wells
conrad
galsworthy
shaw
bennett
and
the
rest
depend
on
america
for
over
half
their

how
does
little
tommy
like
the

tom
was
overcome
he
dropped
his
arms
until
they
swung
loosely
beside
the
chair
and
emitted
faint
grunts
i
writing
a
satire
on
now
calling
it

hearst
reviewers
let
hear
it
said
amory
eagerly
i
only
got
the
last
few
lines
that
very
modern
let
hear
if
they
tom
produced
a
folded
paper
from
his
pocket
and
read
aloud
pausing
at
intervals
so
that

could
see
that

break

they
smile
so

were

cripples
and
that

end
of

was

said

glancing
at

buy

on
the
strength
of
the
juvenalia
of
your
collected
looking
backward
july
sweltered
out
with
a
last
hot
week
and
amory
in
another
surge
of
unrest
realized
that
it
was
just
five
months
since
he
and
rosalind
had
met
yet
it
was
already
hard
for
him
to
visualize
the
boy
who
had
stepped
off
the
transport
passionately
desiring
the
adventure
of
life
one
night
while
the
heat
overpowering
and
enervating
poured
into
the
windows
of
his
room
he
struggled
for
several
hours
in
a
vague
effort
to
immortalize
the
poignancy
of
that
time
the
february
streets
by
night
blow
full
of
strange
damps
bearing
on
wasted
walks
in
shining
sight
wet
snow
plashed
into
gleams
under
the
lamps
like
golden
oil
from
some
divine
machine
in
an
hour
of
thaw
and
stars
strange
damps
full
of
the
eyes
of
many
men
crowded
with
life
borne
in
upon
a
lull
oh
i
was
young
for
i
could
turn
again
to
you
most
finite
and
most
beautiful
and
taste
the
stuff
of
dreams
sweet
and
new
on
your
mouth
there
was
a
tanging
in
the
midnight
air
silence
was
dead
and
sound
not
yet
awoken
life
cracked
like
ice
one
brilliant
note
and
there
radiant
and
pale
you
stood
and
spring
had
broken
the
icicles
were
short
upon
the
roofs
and
the
changeling
city
swooned
our
thoughts
were
frosty
mist
along
the
eaves
our
two
ghosts
kissed
high
on
the
long
mazed
wires
eerie
echoes
here
and
leaves
only
a
fatuous
sigh
for
young
desires
regret
has
followed
after
things
she
loved
leaving
the
great
husk
another
ending
in
came
a
letter
from
monsignor
darcy
who
had
evidently
just
stumbled
on
his
address
my
dear
boy
your
last
letter
was
quite
enough
to
make
me
worry
about
you
it
was
not
a
bit
like
yourself
reading
between
the
lines
i
should
imagine
that
your
engagement
to
this
girl
is
making
you
rather
unhappy
and
i
see
you
have
lost
all
the
feeling
of
romance
that
you
had
before
the
war
you
make
a
great
mistake
if
you
think
you
can
be
romantic
without
religion
sometimes
i
think
that
with
both
of
us
the
secret
of
success
when
we
find
it
is
the
mystical
element
in
us
something
flows
into
us
that
enlarges
our
personalities
and
when
it
ebbs
out
our
personalities
shrink
i
should
call
your
last
two
letters
rather
shrivelled
beware
of
losing
yourself
in
the
personality
of
another
being
man
or
woman
his
eminence
cardinal
and
the
bishop
of
boston
are
staying
with
me
at
present
so
it
is
hard
for
me
to
get
a
moment
to
write
but
i
wish
you
would
come
up
here
later
if
only
for
a
i
go
to
washington
this
week
what
i
shall
do
in
the
future
is
hanging
in
the
balance
absolutely
between
ourselves
i
should
not
be
surprised
to
see
the
red
hat
of
a
cardinal
descend
upon
my
unworthy
head
within
the
next
eight
months
in
any
event
i
should
like
to
have
a
house
in
new
york
or
washington
where
you
could
drop
in
for
amory
i
very
glad
we
both
alive
this
war
could
easily
have
been
the
end
of
a
brilliant
family
but
in
regard
to
matrimony
you
are
now
at
the
most
dangerous
period
of
your
life
you
might
marry
in
haste
and
repent
at
leisure
but
i
think
you
wo
from
what
you
write
me
about
the
present
calamitous
state
of
your
finances
what
you
want
is
naturally
impossible
however
if
i
judge
you
by
the
means
i
usually
choose
i
should
say
that
there
will
be
something
of
an
emotional
crisis
within
the
next
year
do
write
me
i
feel
annoyingly
out
of
date
on
you
with
greatest
affection
thayer
darcy
within
a
week
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter
their
little
household
fell
precipitously
to
pieces
the
immediate
cause
was
the
serious
and
probably
chronic
illness
of
tom
mother
so
they
stored
the
furniture
gave
instructions
to
sublet
and
shook
hands
gloomily
in
the
pennsylvania
station
amory
and
tom
seemed
always
to
be
saying
feeling
very
much
alone
amory
yielded
to
an
impulse
and
set
off
southward
intending
to
join
monsignor
in
washington
they
missed
connections
by
two
hours
and
deciding
to
spend
a
few
days
with
an
ancient
remembered
uncle
amory
journeyed
up
through
the
luxuriant
fields
of
maryland
into
ramilly
county
but
instead
of
two
days
his
stay
lasted
from
nearly
through
september
for
in
maryland
he
met
eleanor
chapter
young
irony
for
years
afterward
when
amory
thought
of
eleanor
he
seemed
still
to
hear
the
wind
sobbing
around
him
and
sending
little
chills
into
the
places
beside
his
heart
the
night
when
they
rode
up
the
slope
and
watched
the
cold
moon
float
through
the
clouds
he
lost
a
further
part
of
him
that
nothing
could
restore
and
when
he
lost
it
he
lost
also
the
power
of
regretting
it
eleanor
was
say
the
last
time
that
evil
crept
close
to
amory
under
the
mask
of
beauty
the
last
weird
mystery
that
held
him
with
wild
fascination
and
pounded
his
soul
to
flakes
with
her
his
imagination
ran
riot
and
that
is
why
they
rode
to
the
highest
hill
and
watched
an
evil
moon
ride
high
for
they
knew
then
that
they
could
see
the
devil
in
each
other
but
eleanor
did
amory
dream
her
afterward
their
ghosts
played
yet
both
of
them
hoped
from
their
souls
never
to
meet
was
it
the
infinite
sadness
of
her
eyes
that
drew
him
or
the
mirror
of
himself
that
he
found
in
the
gorgeous
clarity
of
her
mind
she
will
have
no
other
adventure
like
amory
and
if
she
reads
this
she
will
say
and
amory
will
have
no
other
adventure
like
nor
will
she
sigh
any
more
than
he
would
sigh
eleanor
tried
to
put
it
on
paper
once
the
fading
things
we
only
know
we
have
forgotten
put
away
desires
that
melted
with
the
snow
and
dreams
begotten
this
the
sudden
dawns
we
laughed
to
greet
that
all
could
see
that
none
could
share
will
be
but
dawns
and
if
we
meet
we
shall
not
care
dear
not
one
tear
will
rise
for
this
a
little
while
hence
no
regret
will
stir
for
a
remembered
kiss
not
even
silence
when
we
met
will
give
old
ghosts
a
waste
to
roam
or
stir
the
surface
of
the
sea
if
gray
shapes
drift
beneath
the
foam
we
shall
not
they
quarrelled
dangerously
because
amory
maintained
that
and
could
possibly
be
used
as
a
rhyme
and
then
eleanor
had
part
of
another
verse
that
she
could
find
a
beginning
for
but
wisdom
passes
still
the
years
will
feed
us
wisdom
age
will
go
back
to
the
old
for
all
our
tears
we
shall
not
eleanor
hated
maryland
passionately
she
belonged
to
the
oldest
of
the
old
families
of
ramilly
county
and
lived
in
a
big
gloomy
house
with
her
grandfather
she
had
been
born
and
brought
up
in
france
i
see
i
am
starting
wrong
let
me
begin
again
amory
was
bored
as
he
usually
was
in
the
country
he
used
to
go
for
far
walks
by
himself
and
wander
along
reciting
ulalume
to
the
and
congratulating
poe
for
drinking
himself
to
death
in
that
atmosphere
of
smiling
complacency
one
afternoon
he
had
strolled
for
several
miles
along
a
road
that
was
new
to
him
and
then
through
a
wood
on
bad
advice
from
a
colored
woman
losing
himself
entirely
a
passing
storm
decided
to
break
out
and
to
his
great
impatience
the
sky
grew
black
as
pitch
and
the
rain
began
to
splatter
down
through
the
trees
become
suddenly
furtive
and
ghostly
thunder
rolled
with
menacing
crashes
up
the
valley
and
scattered
through
the
woods
in
intermittent
batteries
he
stumbled
blindly
on
hunting
for
a
way
out
and
finally
through
webs
of
twisted
branches
caught
sight
of
a
rift
in
the
trees
where
the
unbroken
lightning
showed
open
country
he
rushed
to
the
edge
of
the
woods
and
then
hesitated
whether
or
not
to
cross
the
fields
and
try
to
reach
the
shelter
of
the
little
house
marked
by
a
light
far
down
the
valley
it
was
only
half
past
five
but
he
could
see
scarcely
ten
steps
before
him
except
when
the
lightning
made
everything
vivid
and
grotesque
for
great
sweeps
around
suddenly
a
strange
sound
fell
on
his
ears
it
was
a
song
in
a
low
husky
voice
a
girl
voice
and
whoever
was
singing
was
very
close
to
him
a
year
before
he
might
have
laughed
or
trembled
but
in
his
restless
mood
he
only
stood
and
listened
while
the
words
sank
into
his
consciousness
les
sanglots
longs
des
violons
de
blessent
mon
coeur
langueur
the
lightning
split
the
sky
but
the
song
went
on
without
a
quaver
the
girl
was
evidently
in
the
field
and
the
voice
seemed
to
come
vaguely
from
a
haystack
about
twenty
feet
in
front
of
him
then
it
ceased
ceased
and
began
again
in
a
weird
chant
that
soared
and
hung
and
fell
and
blended
with
the
rain
tout
suffocant
et
bleme
quand
sonne
je
me
souviens
des
jours
anciens
et
je
pleure
who
the
devil
is
there
in
ramilly
county
muttered
amory
aloud
who
would
deliver
verlaine
in
an
extemporaneous
tune
to
a
soaking
haystack
somebody
there
cried
the
voice
unalarmed
who
are
you
manfred
christopher
or
queen
victoria
i
don
juan
amory
shouted
on
impulse
raising
his
voice
above
the
noise
of
the
rain
and
the
wind
a
delighted
shriek
came
from
the
haystack
i
know
who
you
are
you
the
blond
boy
that
likes
i
recognize
your
how
do
i
get
up
he
cried
from
the
foot
of
the
haystack
whither
he
had
arrived
dripping
wet
a
head
appeared
over
the
edge
it
was
so
dark
that
amory
could
just
make
out
a
patch
of
damp
hair
and
two
eyes
that
gleamed
like
a
cat
run
back
came
the
voice
and
jump
and
i
catch
your
hand
no
not
there
on
the
other
he
followed
directions
and
as
he
sprawled
up
the
side
in
hay
a
small
white
hand
reached
out
gripped
his
and
helped
him
onto
the
top
here
you
are
juan
cried
she
of
the
damp
hair
do
you
mind
if
i
drop
the
don
you
got
a
thumb
like
mine
he
exclaimed
and
you
holding
my
hand
which
is
dangerous
without
seeing
my
he
dropped
it
quickly
as
if
in
answer
to
his
prayers
came
a
flash
of
lightning
and
he
looked
eagerly
at
her
who
stood
beside
him
on
the
soggy
haystack
ten
feet
above
the
ground
but
she
had
covered
her
face
and
he
saw
nothing
but
a
slender
figure
dark
damp
bobbed
hair
and
the
small
white
hands
with
the
thumbs
that
bent
back
like
his
sit
down
she
suggested
politely
as
the
dark
closed
in
on
them
if
you
sit
opposite
me
in
this
hollow
you
can
have
half
of
the
raincoat
which
i
was
using
as
a
tent
until
you
so
rudely
interrupted
i
was
asked
amory
said
joyfully
you
asked
me
you
know
you
don
juan
always
manages
that
she
said
laughing
but
i
sha
call
you
that
any
more
because
you
got
reddish
hair
instead
you
can
recite
and
i
be
psyche
your
amory
flushed
happily
invisible
under
the
curtain
of
wind
and
rain
they
were
sitting
opposite
each
other
in
a
slight
hollow
in
the
hay
with
the
raincoat
spread
over
most
of
them
and
the
rain
doing
for
the
rest
amory
was
trying
desperately
to
see
psyche
but
the
lightning
refused
to
flash
again
and
he
waited
impatiently
good
lord
supposing
she
beautiful
supposing
she
was
forty
and
pedantic
heavens
suppose
only
suppose
she
was
mad
but
he
knew
the
last
was
unworthy
here
had
providence
sent
a
girl
to
amuse
him
just
as
it
sent
benvenuto
cellini
men
to
murder
and
he
was
wondering
if
she
was
mad
just
because
she
exactly
filled
his
mood
i
not
she
said
not
what
not
mad
i
did
think
you
were
mad
when
i
first
saw
you
so
it
fair
that
you
should
think
so
of
how
on
earth
as
long
as
they
knew
each
other
eleanor
and
amory
could
be
on
a
subject
and
stop
talking
with
the
definite
thought
of
it
in
their
heads
yet
ten
minutes
later
speak
aloud
and
find
that
their
minds
had
followed
the
same
channels
and
led
them
each
to
a
parallel
idea
an
idea
that
others
would
have
found
absolutely
unconnected
with
the
first
tell
me
he
demanded
leaning
forward
eagerly
how
do
you
know
about
how
did
you
know
the
color
of
my
hair
what
your
name
what
were
you
doing
here
tell
me
all
at
once
suddenly
the
lightning
flashed
in
with
a
leap
of
overreaching
light
and
he
saw
eleanor
and
looked
for
the
first
time
into
those
eyes
of
hers
oh
she
was
magnificent
pale
skin
the
color
of
marble
in
starlight
slender
brows
and
eyes
that
glittered
green
as
emeralds
in
the
blinding
glare
she
was
a
witch
of
perhaps
nineteen
he
judged
alert
and
dreamy
and
with
the
white
line
over
her
upper
lip
that
was
a
weakness
and
a
delight
he
sank
back
with
a
gasp
against
the
wall
of
hay
now
you
seen
me
she
said
calmly
and
i
suppose
you
about
to
say
that
my
green
eyes
are
burning
into
your
what
color
is
your
hair
he
asked
intently
it
bobbed
is
it
yes
it
bobbed
i
do
know
what
color
it
is
she
answered
musing
so
many
men
have
asked
me
it
medium
i
suppose
no
one
ever
looks
long
at
my
hair
i
got
beautiful
eyes
though
have
i
care
what
you
say
i
have
beautiful
answer
my
question
do
remember
them
all
besides
my
name
is
madeline
it
i
might
have
guessed
it
you
like
eleanor
you
have
that
eleanor
look
you
know
what
i
there
was
a
silence
as
they
listened
to
the
rain
it
going
down
my
neck
fellow
lunatic
she
offered
finally
answer
my
well
name
of
savage
eleanor
live
in
big
old
house
mile
down
road
nearest
living
relation
to
be
notified
grandfather
ramilly
savage
height
five
feet
four
inches
number
on
w
nose
delicate
aquiline
temperament
uncanny
and
me
amory
interrupted
where
did
you
see
me
oh
you
one
of
men
she
answered
haughtily
must
lug
old
self
into
conversation
well
my
boy
i
was
behind
a
hedge
sunning
myself
one
day
last
week
and
along
comes
a
man
saying
in
a
pleasant
conceited
way
of
talking
now
when
the
night
was
says
he
the
star
dials
pointed
to
morn
at
the
end
of
the
path
a
says
he
nebulous
lustre
was
born
so
i
poked
my
eyes
up
over
the
hedge
but
you
had
started
to
run
for
some
unknown
reason
and
so
i
saw
but
the
back
of
your
beautiful
head
says
i
a
man
for
whom
many
of
us
might
sigh
and
i
continued
in
my
best
irish
all
right
amory
interrupted
now
go
back
to
well
i
will
i
one
of
those
people
who
go
through
the
world
giving
other
people
thrills
but
getting
few
myself
except
those
i
read
into
men
on
such
nights
as
these
i
have
the
social
courage
to
go
on
the
stage
but
not
the
energy
i
have
the
patience
to
write
books
and
i
never
met
a
man
i
marry
however
i
only
the
storm
was
dying
down
softly
and
only
the
wind
kept
up
its
ghostly
surge
and
made
the
stack
lean
and
gravely
settle
from
side
to
side
amory
was
in
a
trance
he
felt
that
every
moment
was
precious
he
had
never
met
a
girl
like
this
before
she
would
never
seem
quite
the
same
again
he
did
at
all
feel
like
a
character
in
a
play
the
appropriate
feeling
in
an
unconventional
situation
instead
he
had
a
sense
of
coming
home
i
have
just
made
a
great
decision
said
eleanor
after
another
pause
and
that
is
why
i
here
to
answer
another
of
your
questions
i
have
just
decided
that
i
do
believe
in
really
how
banal
frightfully
so
she
answered
but
depressing
with
a
stale
sickly
depression
nevertheless
i
came
out
here
to
get
wet
like
a
wet
hen
wet
hens
always
have
great
clarity
of
mind
she
concluded
go
on
amory
said
politely
well
i
not
afraid
of
the
dark
so
i
put
on
my
slicker
and
rubber
boots
and
came
out
you
see
i
was
always
afraid
before
to
say
i
believe
in
god
because
the
lightning
might
strike
me
but
here
i
am
and
it
has
of
course
but
the
main
point
is
that
this
time
i
was
any
more
afraid
of
it
than
i
had
been
when
i
was
a
christian
scientist
like
i
was
last
year
so
now
i
know
i
a
materialist
and
i
was
fraternizing
with
the
hay
when
you
came
out
and
stood
by
the
woods
scared
to
why
you
little
wretch
cried
amory
indignantly
scared
of
what
she
shouted
and
he
jumped
she
clapped
her
hands
and
laughed
see
see
conscience
kill
it
like
me
eleanor
savage
materiologist
no
jumping
no
starting
come
early
but
i
to
have
a
soul
he
objected
i
ca
be
rational
and
i
wo
be
she
leaned
toward
him
her
burning
eyes
never
leaving
his
own
and
whispered
with
a
sort
of
romantic
finality
i
thought
so
juan
i
feared
so
you
sentimental
you
not
like
me
i
a
romantic
little
i
not
sentimental
i
as
romantic
as
you
are
the
idea
you
know
is
that
the
sentimental
person
thinks
things
will
last
the
romantic
person
has
a
desperate
confidence
that
they
this
was
an
ancient
distinction
of
amory
epigrams
i
going
home
she
said
sadly
let
get
off
the
haystack
and
walk
to
the
they
slowly
descended
from
their
perch
she
would
not
let
him
help
her
down
and
motioning
him
away
arrived
in
a
graceful
lump
in
the
soft
mud
where
she
sat
for
an
instant
laughing
at
herself
then
she
jumped
to
her
feet
and
slipped
her
hand
into
his
and
they
tiptoed
across
the
fields
jumping
and
swinging
from
dry
spot
to
dry
spot
a
transcendent
delight
seemed
to
sparkle
in
every
pool
of
water
for
the
moon
had
risen
and
the
storm
had
scurried
away
into
western
maryland
when
arm
touched
his
he
felt
his
hands
grow
cold
with
deadly
fear
lest
he
should
lose
the
shadow
brush
with
which
his
imagination
was
painting
wonders
of
her
he
watched
her
from
the
corners
of
his
eyes
as
ever
he
did
when
he
walked
with
her
she
was
a
feast
and
a
folly
and
he
wished
it
had
been
his
destiny
to
sit
forever
on
a
haystack
and
see
life
through
her
green
eyes
his
paganism
soared
that
night
and
when
she
faded
out
like
a
gray
ghost
down
the
road
a
deep
singing
came
out
of
the
fields
and
filled
his
way
homeward
all
night
the
summer
moths
flitted
in
and
out
of
amory
window
all
night
large
looming
sounds
swayed
in
mystic
revery
through
the
silver
grain
and
he
lay
awake
in
the
clear
darkness
september
amory
selected
a
blade
of
grass
and
nibbled
at
it
scientifically
i
never
fall
in
love
in
august
or
september
he
proffered
when
then
christmas
or
easter
i
a
easter
she
turned
up
her
nose
huh
spring
in
corsets
easter
bore
spring
would
she
easter
has
her
hair
braided
wears
a
tailored
bind
on
thy
sandals
oh
thou
most
fleet
over
the
splendor
and
speed
of
thy
feet
quoted
eleanor
softly
and
then
added
i
suppose
is
a
better
day
for
autumn
than
much
better
and
christmas
eve
does
very
well
for
winter
but
summer
summer
has
no
day
she
said
we
ca
possibly
have
a
summer
love
so
many
people
have
tried
that
the
name
become
proverbial
summer
is
only
the
unfulfilled
promise
of
spring
a
charlatan
in
place
of
the
warm
balmy
nights
i
dream
of
in
april
it
a
sad
season
of
life
without
growth
it
has
no
fourth
of
july
amory
suggested
facetiously
do
be
funny
she
said
raking
him
with
her
eyes
well
what
could
fulfil
the
promise
of
spring
she
thought
a
moment
oh
i
suppose
heaven
would
if
there
was
one
she
said
finally
a
sort
of
pagan
heaven
you
ought
to
be
a
materialist
she
continued
irrelevantly
why
because
you
look
a
good
deal
like
the
pictures
of
rupert
to
some
extent
amory
tried
to
play
rupert
brooke
as
long
as
he
knew
eleanor
what
he
said
his
attitude
toward
life
toward
her
toward
himself
were
all
reflexes
of
the
dead
englishman
literary
moods
often
she
sat
in
the
grass
a
lazy
wind
playing
with
her
short
hair
her
voice
husky
as
she
ran
up
and
down
the
scale
from
grantchester
to
waikiki
there
was
something
most
passionate
in
eleanor
reading
aloud
they
seemed
nearer
not
only
mentally
but
physically
when
they
read
than
when
she
was
in
his
arms
and
this
was
often
for
they
fell
half
into
love
almost
from
the
first
yet
was
amory
capable
of
love
now
he
could
as
always
run
through
the
emotions
in
a
half
hour
but
even
while
they
revelled
in
their
imaginations
he
knew
that
neither
of
them
could
care
as
he
had
cared
once
before
i
suppose
that
was
why
they
turned
to
brooke
and
swinburne
and
shelley
their
chance
was
to
make
everything
fine
and
finished
and
rich
and
imaginative
they
must
bend
tiny
golden
tentacles
from
his
imagination
to
hers
that
would
take
the
place
of
the
great
deep
love
that
was
never
so
near
yet
never
so
much
of
a
dream
one
poem
they
read
over
and
over
swinburne
triumph
of
time
and
four
lines
of
it
rang
in
his
memory
afterward
on
warm
nights
when
he
saw
the
fireflies
among
dusky
tree
trunks
and
heard
the
low
drone
of
many
frogs
then
eleanor
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
night
and
stand
by
him
and
he
heard
her
throaty
voice
with
its
tone
of
a
drum
repeating
is
it
worth
a
tear
is
it
worth
an
hour
to
think
of
things
that
are
well
outworn
of
fruitless
husk
and
fugitive
flower
the
dream
foregone
and
the
deed
foreborne
they
were
formally
introduced
two
days
later
and
his
aunt
told
him
her
history
the
ramillys
were
two
old
ramilly
and
his
granddaughter
eleanor
she
had
lived
in
france
with
a
restless
mother
whom
amory
imagined
to
have
been
very
like
his
own
on
whose
death
she
had
come
to
america
to
live
in
maryland
she
had
gone
to
baltimore
first
to
stay
with
a
bachelor
uncle
and
there
she
insisted
on
being
a
debutante
at
the
age
of
seventeen
she
had
a
wild
winter
and
arrived
in
the
country
in
march
having
quarrelled
frantically
with
all
her
baltimore
relatives
and
shocked
them
into
fiery
protest
a
rather
fast
crowd
had
come
out
who
drank
cocktails
in
limousines
and
were
promiscuously
condescending
and
patronizing
toward
older
people
and
eleanor
with
an
esprit
that
hinted
strongly
of
the
boulevards
led
many
innocents
still
redolent
of
timothy
and
farmington
into
paths
of
bohemian
naughtiness
when
the
story
came
to
her
uncle
a
forgetful
cavalier
of
a
more
hypocritical
era
there
was
a
scene
from
which
eleanor
emerged
subdued
but
rebellious
and
indignant
to
seek
haven
with
her
grandfather
who
hovered
in
the
country
on
the
near
side
of
senility
that
as
far
as
her
story
went
she
told
him
the
rest
herself
but
that
was
later
often
they
swam
and
as
amory
floated
lazily
in
the
water
he
shut
his
mind
to
all
thoughts
except
those
of
hazy
lands
where
the
sun
splattered
through
trees
how
could
any
one
possibly
think
or
worry
or
do
anything
except
splash
and
dive
and
loll
there
on
the
edge
of
time
while
the
flower
months
failed
let
the
days
move
over
sadness
and
memory
and
pain
recurred
outside
and
here
once
more
before
he
went
on
to
meet
them
he
wanted
to
drift
and
be
young
there
were
days
when
amory
resented
that
life
had
changed
from
an
even
progress
along
a
road
stretching
ever
in
sight
with
the
scenery
merging
and
blending
into
a
succession
of
quick
unrelated
scenes
two
years
of
sweat
and
blood
that
sudden
absurd
instinct
for
paternity
that
rosalind
had
stirred
the
quality
of
this
autumn
with
eleanor
he
felt
that
it
would
take
all
time
more
than
he
could
ever
spare
to
glue
these
strange
cumbersome
pictures
into
the
of
his
life
it
was
all
like
a
banquet
where
he
sat
for
this
of
his
youth
and
tried
to
enjoy
brilliant
epicurean
courses
dimly
he
promised
himself
a
time
where
all
should
be
welded
together
for
months
it
seemed
that
he
had
alternated
between
being
borne
along
a
stream
of
love
or
fascination
or
left
in
an
eddy
and
in
the
eddies
he
had
not
desired
to
think
rather
to
be
picked
up
on
a
wave
top
and
swept
along
again
the
despairing
dying
autumn
and
our
love
how
well
they
harmonize
said
eleanor
sadly
one
day
as
they
lay
dripping
by
the
water
the
indian
summer
of
our
hearts
he
ceased
tell
me
she
said
finally
was
she
light
or
dark
was
she
more
beautiful
than
i
am
i
do
know
said
amory
shortly
one
night
they
walked
while
the
moon
rose
and
poured
a
great
burden
of
glory
over
the
garden
until
it
seemed
fairyland
with
amory
and
eleanor
dim
phantasmal
shapes
expressing
eternal
beauty
in
curious
elfin
love
moods
then
they
turned
out
of
the
moonlight
into
the
trellised
darkness
of
a
pagoda
where
there
were
scents
so
plaintive
as
to
be
nearly
musical
light
a
match
she
whispered
i
want
to
see
scratch
flare
the
night
and
the
scarred
trees
were
like
scenery
in
a
play
and
to
be
there
with
eleanor
shadowy
and
unreal
seemed
somehow
oddly
familiar
amory
thought
how
it
was
only
the
past
that
ever
seemed
strange
and
unbelievable
the
match
went
out
it
black
as
we
just
voices
now
murmured
eleanor
little
lonesome
voices
light
that
was
my
last
suddenly
he
caught
her
in
his
arms
you
mine
you
know
you
mine
he
cried
wildly
the
moonlight
twisted
in
through
the
vines
and
listened
the
fireflies
hung
upon
their
whispers
as
if
to
win
his
glance
from
the
glory
of
their
eyes
the
end
of
summer
no
wind
is
stirring
in
the
grass
not
one
wind
stirs
the
water
in
the
hidden
pools
as
glass
fronts
the
full
moon
and
so
inters
the
golden
token
in
its
icy
mass
chanted
eleanor
to
the
trees
that
skeletoned
the
body
of
the
night
is
it
ghostly
here
if
you
can
hold
your
horse
feet
up
let
cut
through
the
woods
and
find
the
hidden
it
after
one
and
you
get
the
devil
he
objected
and
i
know
enough
about
horses
to
put
one
away
in
the
pitch
shut
up
you
old
fool
she
whispered
irrelevantly
and
leaning
over
she
patted
him
lazily
with
her
you
can
leave
your
old
plug
in
our
stable
and
i
send
him
over
but
my
uncle
has
got
to
drive
me
to
the
station
with
this
old
plug
at
seven
do
be
a
remember
you
have
a
tendency
toward
wavering
that
prevents
you
from
being
the
entire
light
of
my
amory
drew
his
horse
up
close
beside
and
leaning
toward
her
grasped
her
hand
say
i
am
or
i
pull
you
over
and
make
you
ride
behind
she
looked
up
and
smiled
and
shook
her
head
excitedly
oh
do
or
rather
do
why
are
all
the
exciting
things
so
uncomfortable
like
fighting
and
exploring
and
in
canada
by
the
way
we
going
to
ride
up
harper
hill
i
think
that
comes
in
our
programme
about
five
you
little
devil
amory
growled
you
going
to
make
me
stay
up
all
night
and
sleep
in
the
train
like
an
immigrant
all
day
going
back
to
new
hush
some
one
coming
along
the
road
let
go
and
with
a
shout
that
probably
gave
the
belated
traveller
a
series
of
shivers
she
turned
her
horse
into
the
woods
and
amory
followed
slowly
as
he
had
followed
her
all
day
for
three
weeks
the
summer
was
over
but
he
had
spent
the
days
in
watching
eleanor
a
graceful
facile
manfred
build
herself
intellectual
and
imaginative
pyramids
while
she
revelled
in
the
artificialities
of
the
temperamental
teens
and
they
wrote
poetry
at
the
when
vanity
kissed
vanity
a
hundred
happy
junes
ago
he
pondered
her
breathlessly
and
that
all
men
might
ever
know
he
rhymed
her
eyes
with
life
and
death
thru
time
i
save
my
love
he
said
yet
beauty
vanished
with
his
breath
and
with
her
lovers
she
was
dead
ever
his
wit
and
not
her
eyes
ever
his
art
and
not
her
hair
who
learn
a
trick
in
rhyme
be
wise
and
pause
before
his
sonnet
there
so
all
my
words
however
true
might
sing
you
to
a
thousandth
june
and
no
one
ever
that
you
were
beauty
for
an
afternoon
so
he
wrote
one
day
when
he
pondered
how
coldly
we
thought
of
the
dark
lady
of
the
sonnets
and
how
little
we
remembered
her
as
the
great
man
wanted
her
remembered
for
what
shakespeare
have
desired
to
have
been
able
to
write
with
such
divine
despair
was
that
the
lady
should
live
and
now
we
have
no
real
interest
in
her
the
irony
of
it
is
that
if
he
had
cared
for
the
poem
than
for
the
lady
the
sonnet
would
be
only
obvious
imitative
rhetoric
and
no
one
would
ever
have
read
it
after
twenty
years
this
was
the
last
night
amory
ever
saw
eleanor
he
was
leaving
in
the
morning
and
they
had
agreed
to
take
a
long
farewell
trot
by
the
cold
moonlight
she
wanted
to
talk
she
said
perhaps
the
last
time
in
her
life
that
she
could
be
rational
she
meant
pose
with
comfort
so
they
had
turned
into
the
woods
and
rode
for
half
an
hour
with
scarcely
a
word
except
when
she
whispered
damn
at
a
bothersome
branch
whispered
it
as
no
other
girl
was
ever
able
to
whisper
it
then
they
started
up
harper
hill
walking
their
tired
horses
good
lord
it
quiet
here
whispered
eleanor
much
more
lonesome
than
the
i
hate
woods
amory
said
shuddering
any
kind
of
foliage
or
underbrush
at
night
out
here
it
so
broad
and
easy
on
the
the
long
slope
of
a
long
and
the
cold
moon
rolling
moonlight
down
and
thee
and
me
last
and
most
it
was
quiet
that
night
the
straight
road
they
followed
up
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
knew
few
footsteps
at
any
time
only
an
occasional
negro
cabin
in
the
moonlight
broke
the
long
line
of
bare
ground
behind
lay
the
black
edge
of
the
woods
like
a
dark
frosting
on
white
cake
and
ahead
the
sharp
high
horizon
it
was
much
colder
so
cold
that
it
settled
on
them
and
drove
all
the
warm
nights
from
their
minds
the
end
of
summer
said
eleanor
softly
listen
to
the
beat
of
our
horses
hoofs
have
you
ever
been
feverish
and
had
all
noises
divide
into
until
you
could
swear
eternity
was
divisible
into
so
many
tumps
that
the
way
i
feel
old
horses
go
i
guess
that
the
only
thing
that
separates
horses
and
clocks
from
us
human
beings
ca
go
without
going
the
breeze
freshened
and
eleanor
pulled
her
cape
around
her
and
shivered
are
you
very
cold
asked
amory
no
i
thinking
about
myself
my
black
old
inside
self
the
real
one
with
the
fundamental
honesty
that
keeps
me
from
being
absolutely
wicked
by
making
me
realize
my
own
they
were
riding
up
close
by
the
cliff
and
amory
gazed
over
where
the
fall
met
the
ground
a
hundred
feet
below
a
black
stream
made
a
sharp
line
broken
by
tiny
glints
in
the
swift
water
rotten
rotten
old
world
broke
out
eleanor
suddenly
and
the
wretchedest
thing
of
all
is
me
oh
am
i
a
girl
why
am
i
not
a
stupid
look
at
you
you
stupider
than
i
am
not
much
but
some
and
you
can
lope
about
and
get
bored
and
then
lope
somewhere
else
and
you
can
play
around
with
girls
without
being
involved
in
meshes
of
sentiment
and
you
can
do
anything
and
be
justified
and
here
am
i
with
the
brains
to
do
everything
yet
tied
to
the
sinking
ship
of
future
matrimony
if
i
were
born
a
hundred
years
from
now
well
and
good
but
now
what
in
store
for
me
i
have
to
marry
that
goes
without
saying
who
i
too
bright
for
most
men
and
yet
i
have
to
descend
to
their
level
and
let
them
patronize
my
intellect
in
order
to
get
their
attention
every
year
that
i
do
marry
i
got
less
chance
for
a
man
at
the
best
i
can
have
my
choice
from
one
or
two
cities
and
of
course
i
have
to
marry
into
a
listen
she
leaned
close
again
i
like
clever
men
and
men
and
of
course
no
one
cares
more
for
personality
than
i
do
oh
just
one
person
in
fifty
has
any
glimmer
of
what
sex
is
i
hipped
on
freud
and
all
that
but
it
rotten
that
every
bit
of
love
in
the
world
is
per
cent
passion
and
one
little
soupcon
of
she
finished
as
suddenly
as
she
began
of
course
you
right
amory
agreed
it
a
rather
unpleasant
overpowering
force
that
part
of
the
machinery
under
everything
like
an
actor
that
lets
you
see
his
mechanics
wait
a
minute
till
i
think
this
out
he
paused
and
tried
to
get
a
metaphor
they
had
turned
the
cliff
and
were
riding
along
the
road
about
fifty
feet
to
the
left
you
see
every
one
got
to
have
some
cloak
to
throw
around
it
the
mediocre
intellects
plato
second
class
use
the
remnants
of
romantic
chivalry
diluted
with
victorian
sentiment
and
we
who
consider
ourselves
the
intellectuals
cover
it
up
by
pretending
that
it
another
side
of
us
has
nothing
to
do
with
our
shining
brains
we
pretend
that
the
fact
that
we
realize
it
is
really
absolving
us
from
being
a
prey
to
it
but
the
truth
is
that
sex
is
right
in
the
middle
of
our
purest
abstractions
so
close
that
it
obscures
vision
i
can
kiss
you
now
and
will
he
leaned
toward
her
in
his
saddle
but
she
drew
away
i
ca
i
ca
kiss
you
now
i
more
you
more
stupid
then
he
declared
rather
impatiently
intellect
is
no
protection
from
sex
any
more
than
convention
is
what
is
she
fired
up
the
catholic
church
or
the
maxims
of
confucius
amory
looked
up
rather
taken
aback
that
your
panacea
is
it
she
cried
oh
you
just
an
old
hypocrite
too
thousands
of
scowling
priests
keeping
the
degenerate
italians
and
illiterate
irish
repentant
with
about
the
sixth
and
ninth
commandments
it
just
all
cloaks
sentiment
and
spiritual
rouge
and
panaceas
i
tell
you
there
is
no
god
not
even
a
definite
abstract
goodness
so
it
all
got
to
be
worked
out
for
the
individual
by
the
individual
here
in
high
white
foreheads
like
mine
and
you
too
much
the
prig
to
admit
she
let
go
her
reins
and
shook
her
little
fists
at
the
stars
if
there
a
god
let
him
strike
me
strike
me
talking
about
god
again
after
the
manner
of
atheists
amory
said
sharply
his
materialism
always
a
thin
cloak
was
torn
to
shreds
by
eleanor
blasphemy
she
knew
it
and
it
angered
him
that
she
knew
it
and
like
most
intellectuals
who
do
find
faith
convenient
he
continued
coldly
like
napoleon
and
oscar
wilde
and
the
rest
of
your
type
you
yell
loudly
for
a
priest
on
your
eleanor
drew
her
horse
up
sharply
and
he
reined
in
beside
her
will
i
she
said
in
a
queer
voice
that
scared
him
will
i
watch
going
over
the
cliff
and
before
he
could
interfere
she
had
turned
and
was
riding
breakneck
for
the
end
of
the
plateau
he
wheeled
and
started
after
her
his
body
like
ice
his
nerves
in
a
vast
clangor
there
was
no
chance
of
stopping
her
the
moon
was
under
a
cloud
and
her
horse
would
step
blindly
over
then
some
ten
feet
from
the
edge
of
the
cliff
she
gave
a
sudden
shriek
and
flung
herself
sideways
plunged
from
her
horse
and
rolling
over
twice
landed
in
a
pile
of
brush
five
feet
from
the
edge
the
horse
went
over
with
a
frantic
whinny
in
a
minute
he
was
by
eleanor
side
and
saw
that
her
eyes
were
open
eleanor
he
cried
she
did
not
answer
but
her
lips
moved
and
her
eyes
filled
with
sudden
tears
eleanor
are
you
hurt
no
i
do
think
so
she
said
faintly
and
then
began
weeping
my
horse
dead
good
god
yes
oh
she
wailed
i
thought
i
was
going
over
i
did
know
he
helped
her
gently
to
her
feet
and
boosted
her
onto
his
saddle
so
they
started
homeward
amory
walking
and
she
bent
forward
on
the
pommel
sobbing
bitterly
i
got
a
crazy
streak
she
faltered
twice
before
i
done
things
like
that
when
i
was
eleven
mother
went
went
mad
stark
raving
crazy
we
were
in
vienna
all
the
way
back
she
talked
haltingly
about
herself
and
amory
love
waned
slowly
with
the
moon
at
her
door
they
started
from
habit
to
kiss
good
night
but
she
could
not
run
into
his
arms
nor
were
they
stretched
to
meet
her
as
in
the
week
before
for
a
minute
they
stood
there
hating
each
other
with
a
bitter
sadness
but
as
amory
had
loved
himself
in
eleanor
so
now
what
he
hated
was
only
a
mirror
their
poses
were
strewn
about
the
pale
dawn
like
broken
glass
the
stars
were
long
gone
and
there
were
left
only
the
little
sighing
gusts
of
wind
and
the
silences
between
but
naked
souls
are
poor
things
ever
and
soon
he
turned
homeward
and
let
new
lights
come
in
with
the
sun
a
poem
that
eleanor
sent
amory
several
years
later
here
over
the
lilt
of
the
water
lisping
its
music
and
bearing
a
burden
of
light
bosoming
day
as
a
laughing
and
radiant
daughter
here
we
may
whisper
unheard
unafraid
of
the
night
walking
alone
was
it
splendor
or
what
we
were
bound
with
deep
in
the
time
when
summer
lets
down
her
hair
shadows
we
loved
and
the
patterns
they
covered
the
ground
with
tapestries
mystical
faint
in
the
breathless
air
that
was
the
day
and
the
night
for
another
story
pale
as
a
dream
and
shadowed
with
pencilled
trees
ghosts
of
the
stars
came
by
who
had
sought
for
glory
whispered
to
us
of
peace
in
the
plaintive
breeze
whispered
of
old
dead
faiths
that
the
day
had
shattered
youth
the
penny
that
bought
delight
of
the
moon
that
was
the
urge
that
we
knew
and
the
language
that
mattered
that
was
the
debt
that
we
paid
to
the
usurer
june
here
deepest
of
dreams
by
the
waters
that
bring
not
anything
back
of
the
past
that
we
need
not
know
what
if
the
light
is
but
sun
and
the
little
streams
sing
not
we
are
together
it
seems
i
have
loved
you
so
what
did
the
last
night
hold
with
the
summer
over
drawing
us
back
to
the
home
in
the
changing
glade
leered
out
of
the
dark
in
the
ghostly
clover
god
till
you
stirred
in
your
sleep
and
were
wild
afraid
well
we
have
passed
we
are
chronicle
now
to
the
eerie
curious
metal
from
meteors
that
failed
in
the
sky
the
tireless
is
stretched
by
the
water
quite
weary
close
to
this
ununderstandable
changeling
that
i
fear
is
an
echo
we
traced
to
security
daughter
now
we
are
faces
and
voices
and
less
too
soon
whispering
over
the
lilt
of
the
water
youth
the
penny
that
bought
delight
of
the
a
poem
amory
sent
to
eleanor
and
which
he
called
summer
storm
faint
winds
and
a
song
fading
and
leaves
falling
faint
winds
and
far
away
a
fading
laughter
and
the
rain
and
over
the
fields
a
voice
calling
our
gray
blown
cloud
scurries
and
lifts
above
slides
on
the
sun
and
flutters
there
to
waft
her
sisters
on
the
shadow
of
a
dove
falls
on
the
cote
the
trees
are
filled
with
wings
and
down
the
valley
through
the
crying
trees
the
body
of
the
darker
storm
flies
brings
with
its
new
air
the
breath
of
sunken
seas
and
slender
tenuous
thunder
but
i
wait
wait
for
the
mists
and
for
the
blacker
rain
heavier
winds
that
stir
the
veil
of
fate
happier
winds
that
pile
her
hair
again
they
tear
me
teach
me
strew
the
heavy
air
upon
me
winds
that
i
know
and
storm
there
was
a
summer
every
rain
was
rare
there
was
a
season
every
wind
was
warm
and
now
you
pass
me
in
the
mist
your
hair
about
you
damp
lips
curved
once
more
in
that
wild
irony
that
gay
despair
that
made
you
old
when
we
have
met
before
you
drift
on
out
before
the
rain
across
the
fields
blown
with
the
stemless
flowers
with
your
old
hopes
dead
leaves
and
loves
again
dim
as
a
dream
and
wan
with
all
old
hours
whispers
will
creep
into
the
growing
dark
tumult
will
die
over
the
trees
now
night
tears
from
her
wetted
breast
the
splattered
blouse
of
day
glides
down
the
dreaming
hills
to
cover
with
her
hair
the
eerie
green
love
for
the
dusk
love
for
the
glistening
after
quiet
the
trees
to
their
last
tops
serene
faint
winds
and
far
away
a
fading
laughter
chapter
the
supercilious
sacrifice
atlantic
city
amory
paced
the
board
walk
at
day
end
lulled
by
the
everlasting
surge
of
changing
waves
smelling
the
odor
of
the
salt
breeze
the
sea
he
thought
had
treasured
its
memories
deeper
than
the
faithless
land
it
seemed
still
to
whisper
of
norse
galleys
ploughing
the
water
world
under
flags
of
the
british
dreadnoughts
gray
bulwarks
of
civilization
steaming
up
through
the
fog
of
one
dark
july
into
the
north
sea
well
amory
blaine
amory
looked
down
into
the
street
below
a
low
racing
car
had
drawn
to
a
stop
and
a
familiar
cheerful
face
protruded
from
the
driver
seat
come
on
down
goopher
cried
alec
amory
called
a
greeting
and
descending
a
flight
of
wooden
steps
approached
the
car
he
and
alec
had
been
meeting
intermittently
but
the
barrier
of
rosalind
lay
always
between
them
he
was
sorry
for
this
he
hated
to
lose
alec
mr
blaine
this
is
miss
waterson
miss
wayne
and
how
do
amory
said
alec
exuberantly
if
you
jump
in
we
take
you
to
some
secluded
nook
and
give
you
a
wee
jolt
of
amory
considered
that
an
step
in
move
over
jill
and
amory
will
smile
very
handsomely
at
amory
squeezed
into
the
back
seat
beside
a
gaudy
blonde
hello
doug
fairbanks
she
said
flippantly
walking
for
exercise
or
hunting
for
company
i
was
counting
the
waves
replied
amory
gravely
i
going
in
for
do
kid
me
when
they
reached
an
unfrequented
side
street
alec
stopped
the
car
among
deep
shadows
what
you
doing
down
here
these
cold
days
amory
he
demanded
as
he
produced
a
quart
of
bourbon
from
under
the
fur
rug
amory
avoided
the
question
indeed
he
had
had
no
definite
reason
for
coming
to
the
coast
do
you
remember
that
party
of
ours
sophomore
year
he
asked
instead
do
i
when
we
slept
in
the
pavilions
up
in
asbury
park
lord
alec
it
hard
to
think
that
jesse
and
dick
and
kerry
are
all
three
alec
shivered
do
talk
about
it
these
dreary
fall
days
depress
me
jill
seemed
to
agree
doug
here
is
sorta
gloomy
anyways
she
commented
tell
him
to
drink
deep
it
good
and
scarce
these
what
i
really
want
to
ask
you
amory
is
where
you
are
why
new
york
i
suppose
i
mean
because
if
you
have
got
a
room
yet
you
better
help
me
glad
you
see
tully
and
i
have
two
rooms
with
bath
between
at
the
ranier
and
he
got
to
go
back
to
new
york
i
do
want
to
have
to
move
question
is
will
you
occupy
one
of
the
rooms
amory
was
willing
if
he
could
get
in
right
away
you
find
the
key
in
the
office
the
rooms
are
in
my
declining
further
locomotion
or
further
stimulation
amory
left
the
car
and
sauntered
back
along
the
board
walk
to
the
hotel
he
was
in
an
eddy
again
a
deep
lethargic
gulf
without
desire
to
work
or
write
love
or
dissipate
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
rather
longed
for
death
to
roll
over
his
generation
obliterating
their
petty
fevers
and
struggles
and
exultations
his
youth
seemed
never
so
vanished
as
now
in
the
contrast
between
the
utter
loneliness
of
this
visit
and
that
riotous
joyful
party
of
four
years
before
things
that
had
been
the
merest
commonplaces
of
his
life
then
deep
sleep
the
sense
of
beauty
around
him
all
desire
had
flown
away
and
the
gaps
they
left
were
filled
only
with
the
great
listlessness
of
his
disillusion
to
hold
a
man
a
woman
has
to
appeal
to
the
worst
in
this
sentence
was
the
thesis
of
most
of
his
bad
nights
of
which
he
felt
this
was
to
be
one
his
mind
had
already
started
to
play
variations
on
the
subject
tireless
passion
fierce
jealousy
longing
to
possess
and
crush
these
alone
were
left
of
all
his
love
for
rosalind
these
remained
to
him
as
payment
for
the
loss
of
his
youth
bitter
calomel
under
the
thin
sugar
of
love
exaltation
in
his
room
he
undressed
and
wrapping
himself
in
blankets
to
keep
out
the
chill
october
air
drowsed
in
an
armchair
by
the
open
window
he
remembered
a
poem
he
had
read
months
before
oh
staunch
old
heart
who
toiled
so
long
for
me
i
waste
my
years
sailing
along
the
sea
yet
he
had
no
sense
of
waste
no
sense
of
the
present
hope
that
waste
implied
he
felt
that
life
had
rejected
him
rosalind
rosalind
he
poured
the
words
softly
into
the
until
she
seemed
to
permeate
the
room
the
wet
salt
breeze
filled
his
hair
with
moisture
the
rim
of
a
moon
seared
the
sky
and
made
the
curtains
dim
and
ghostly
he
fell
asleep
when
he
awoke
it
was
very
late
and
quiet
the
blanket
had
slipped
partly
off
his
shoulders
and
he
touched
his
skin
to
find
it
damp
and
cold
then
he
became
aware
of
a
tense
whispering
not
ten
feet
away
he
became
rigid
do
make
a
sound
it
was
alec
voice
jill
do
you
hear
me
yes
breathed
very
low
very
frightened
they
were
in
the
bathroom
then
his
ears
caught
a
louder
sound
from
somewhere
along
the
corridor
outside
it
was
a
mumbling
of
men
voices
and
a
repeated
muffled
rapping
amory
threw
off
the
blankets
and
moved
close
to
the
bathroom
door
my
god
came
the
girl
voice
again
you
have
to
let
them
sh
suddenly
a
steady
insistent
knocking
began
at
amory
hall
door
and
simultaneously
out
of
the
bathroom
came
alec
followed
by
the
girl
they
were
both
clad
in
pajamas
amory
an
anxious
whisper
what
the
trouble
it
house
detectives
my
god
amory
they
just
looking
for
a
well
better
let
them
you
do
understand
they
can
get
me
under
the
mann
the
girl
followed
him
slowly
a
rather
miserable
pathetic
figure
in
the
darkness
amory
tried
to
plan
quickly
you
make
a
racket
and
let
them
in
your
room
he
suggested
anxiously
and
i
get
her
out
by
this
they
here
too
though
they
watch
this
ca
you
give
a
wrong
name
no
chance
i
registered
under
my
own
name
besides
they
trail
the
auto
license
say
you
jill
says
one
of
the
house
detectives
knows
the
girl
had
stolen
to
the
bed
and
tumbled
upon
it
lay
there
listening
wretchedly
to
the
knocking
which
had
grown
gradually
to
a
pounding
then
came
a
man
voice
angry
and
imperative
open
up
or
we
break
the
door
in
in
the
silence
when
this
voice
ceased
amory
realized
that
there
were
other
things
in
the
room
besides
people
over
and
around
the
figure
crouched
on
the
bed
there
hung
an
aura
gossamer
as
a
moonbeam
tainted
as
stale
weak
wine
yet
a
horror
diffusively
brooding
already
over
the
three
of
them
and
over
by
the
window
among
the
stirring
curtains
stood
something
else
featureless
and
indistinguishable
yet
strangely
familiar
simultaneously
two
great
cases
presented
themselves
side
by
side
to
amory
all
that
took
place
in
his
mind
then
occupied
in
actual
time
less
than
ten
seconds
the
first
fact
that
flashed
radiantly
on
his
comprehension
was
the
great
impersonality
of
sacrifice
he
perceived
that
what
we
call
love
and
hate
reward
and
punishment
had
no
more
to
do
with
it
than
the
date
of
the
month
he
quickly
recapitulated
the
story
of
a
sacrifice
he
had
heard
of
in
college
a
man
had
cheated
in
an
examination
his
roommate
in
a
gust
of
sentiment
had
taken
the
entire
blame
due
to
the
shame
of
it
the
innocent
one
entire
future
seemed
shrouded
in
regret
and
failure
capped
by
the
ingratitude
of
the
real
culprit
he
had
finally
taken
his
own
life
years
afterward
the
facts
had
come
out
at
the
time
the
story
had
both
puzzled
and
worried
amory
now
he
realized
the
truth
that
sacrifice
was
no
purchase
of
freedom
it
was
like
a
great
elective
office
it
was
like
an
inheritance
of
power
to
certain
people
at
certain
times
an
essential
luxury
carrying
with
it
not
a
guarantee
but
a
responsibility
not
a
security
but
an
infinite
risk
its
very
momentum
might
drag
him
down
to
ruin
the
passing
of
the
emotional
wave
that
made
it
possible
might
leave
the
one
who
made
it
high
and
dry
forever
on
an
island
of
despair
amory
knew
that
afterward
alec
would
secretly
hate
him
for
having
done
so
much
for
him
all
this
was
flung
before
amory
like
an
opened
scroll
while
ulterior
to
him
and
speculating
upon
him
were
those
two
breathless
listening
forces
the
gossamer
aura
that
hung
over
and
about
the
girl
and
that
familiar
thing
by
the
window
sacrifice
by
its
very
nature
was
arrogant
and
impersonal
sacrifice
should
be
eternally
supercilious
not
for
me
but
for
thy
that
thought
amory
would
be
somehow
the
way
god
would
talk
to
me
amory
felt
a
sudden
surge
of
joy
and
then
like
a
face
in
a
the
aura
over
the
bed
faded
out
the
dynamic
shadow
by
the
window
that
was
as
near
as
he
could
name
it
remained
for
the
fraction
of
a
moment
and
then
the
breeze
seemed
to
lift
it
swiftly
out
of
the
room
he
clinched
his
hands
in
quick
ecstatic
excitement
the
ten
seconds
were
up
do
what
i
say
alec
do
what
i
say
do
you
understand
alec
looked
at
him
dumbly
his
face
a
tableau
of
anguish
you
have
a
family
continued
amory
slowly
you
have
a
family
and
important
that
you
should
get
out
of
this
do
you
hear
me
he
repeated
clearly
what
he
had
said
do
you
hear
me
i
hear
the
voice
was
curiously
strained
the
eyes
never
for
a
second
left
amory
alec
you
going
to
lie
down
here
if
any
one
comes
in
you
act
drunk
you
do
what
i
say
if
you
do
i
probably
kill
there
was
another
moment
while
they
stared
at
each
other
then
amory
went
briskly
to
the
bureau
and
taking
his
beckoned
peremptorily
to
the
girl
he
heard
one
word
from
alec
that
sounded
like
penitentiary
then
he
and
jill
were
in
the
bathroom
with
the
door
bolted
behind
them
you
here
with
me
he
said
sternly
you
been
with
me
all
she
nodded
gave
a
little
half
cry
in
a
second
he
had
the
door
of
the
other
room
open
and
three
men
entered
there
was
an
immediate
flood
of
electric
light
and
he
stood
there
blinking
you
been
playing
a
little
too
dangerous
a
game
young
man
amory
laughed
well
the
leader
of
the
trio
nodded
authoritatively
at
a
burly
man
in
a
check
suit
all
right
i
got
you
said
olson
nodding
the
other
two
took
a
curious
glance
at
their
quarry
and
then
withdrew
closing
the
door
angrily
behind
them
the
burly
man
regarded
amory
contemptuously
did
you
ever
hear
of
the
mann
act
coming
down
here
with
her
he
indicated
the
girl
with
his
thumb
with
a
new
york
license
on
your
car
to
a
hotel
like
he
shook
his
head
implying
that
he
had
struggled
over
amory
but
now
gave
him
up
well
said
amory
rather
impatiently
what
do
you
want
us
to
do
get
dressed
quick
and
tell
your
friend
not
to
make
such
a
jill
was
sobbing
noisily
on
the
bed
but
at
these
words
she
subsided
sulkily
and
gathering
up
her
clothes
retired
to
the
bathroom
as
amory
slipped
into
alec
he
found
that
his
attitude
toward
the
situation
was
agreeably
humorous
the
aggrieved
virtue
of
the
burly
man
made
him
want
to
laugh
anybody
else
here
demanded
olson
trying
to
look
keen
and
fellow
who
had
the
rooms
said
amory
carelessly
he
drunk
as
an
owl
though
been
in
there
asleep
since
six
i
take
a
look
at
him
how
did
you
find
out
asked
amory
curiously
night
clerk
saw
you
go
with
this
amory
nodded
jill
reappeared
from
the
bathroom
completely
if
rather
untidily
arrayed
now
then
began
olson
producing
a
i
want
your
real
names
no
damn
john
smith
or
mary
wait
a
minute
said
amory
quietly
just
drop
that
stuff
we
merely
got
caught
that
olson
glared
at
him
name
he
snapped
amory
gave
his
name
and
new
york
address
and
the
lady
miss
jill
say
cried
olson
indignantly
just
ease
up
on
the
nursery
rhymes
what
your
name
sarah
murphy
minnie
jackson
oh
my
god
cried
the
girl
cupping
her
face
in
her
hands
i
do
want
my
mother
to
know
i
do
want
my
mother
to
come
on
now
shut
up
cried
amory
at
olson
an
instant
pause
stella
robbins
she
faltered
finally
general
delivery
rugway
new
olson
snapped
his
shut
and
looked
at
them
very
ponderously
by
rights
the
hotel
could
turn
the
evidence
over
to
the
police
and
you
go
to
penitentiary
you
would
for
bringin
a
girl
from
one
state
to
immoral
he
paused
to
let
the
majesty
of
his
words
sink
in
but
the
hotel
is
going
to
let
you
it
does
want
to
get
in
the
papers
cried
jill
fiercely
let
us
off
huh
a
great
lightness
surrounded
amory
he
realized
that
he
was
safe
and
only
then
did
he
appreciate
the
full
enormity
of
what
he
might
have
incurred
however
continued
olson
there
a
protective
association
among
the
hotels
there
been
too
much
of
this
stuff
and
we
got
a
with
the
newspapers
so
that
you
get
a
little
free
publicity
not
the
name
of
the
hotel
but
just
a
line
sayin
that
you
had
a
little
trouble
in
city
see
i
you
gettin
off
light
damn
light
but
come
on
said
amory
briskly
let
get
out
of
here
we
do
need
a
olson
walked
through
the
bathroom
and
took
a
cursory
glance
at
still
form
then
he
extinguished
the
lights
and
motioned
them
to
follow
him
as
they
walked
into
the
elevator
amory
considered
a
piece
of
bravado
yielded
finally
he
reached
out
and
tapped
olson
on
the
arm
would
you
mind
taking
off
your
hat
there
a
lady
in
the
olson
hat
came
off
slowly
there
was
a
rather
embarrassing
two
minutes
under
the
lights
of
the
lobby
while
the
night
clerk
and
a
few
belated
guests
stared
at
them
curiously
the
loudly
dressed
girl
with
bent
head
the
handsome
young
man
with
his
chin
several
points
aloft
the
inference
was
quite
obvious
then
the
chill
outdoors
where
the
salt
air
was
fresher
and
keener
still
with
the
first
hints
of
morning
you
can
get
one
of
those
taxis
and
beat
it
said
olson
pointing
to
the
blurred
outline
of
two
machines
whose
drivers
were
presumably
asleep
inside
said
olson
he
reached
in
his
pocket
suggestively
but
amory
snorted
and
taking
the
girl
arm
turned
away
where
did
you
tell
the
driver
to
go
she
asked
as
they
whirled
along
the
dim
street
the
if
that
guy
writes
my
mother
he
wo
nobody
ever
know
about
this
except
our
friends
and
dawn
was
breaking
over
the
sea
it
getting
blue
she
said
it
does
very
well
agreed
amory
critically
and
then
as
an
it
almost
do
you
want
something
to
eat
food
she
said
with
a
cheerful
laugh
food
is
what
queered
the
party
we
ordered
a
big
supper
to
be
sent
up
to
the
room
about
two
alec
did
give
the
waiter
a
tip
so
i
guess
the
little
bastard
jill
low
spirits
seemed
to
have
gone
faster
than
the
scattering
night
let
me
tell
you
she
said
emphatically
when
you
want
to
stage
that
sorta
party
stay
away
from
liquor
and
when
you
want
to
get
tight
stay
away
from
i
he
tapped
suddenly
at
the
glass
and
they
drew
up
at
the
door
of
an
restaurant
is
alec
a
great
friend
of
yours
asked
jill
as
they
perched
themselves
on
high
stools
inside
and
set
their
elbows
on
the
dingy
counter
he
used
to
be
he
probably
wo
want
to
be
any
more
and
never
understand
it
was
sorta
crazy
you
takin
all
that
blame
is
he
pretty
important
kinda
more
important
than
you
are
amory
laughed
that
remains
to
be
seen
he
answered
that
the
the
collapse
of
several
pillars
two
days
later
back
in
new
york
amory
found
in
a
newspaper
what
he
had
been
searching
for
a
dozen
lines
which
announced
to
whom
it
might
concern
that
amory
blaine
who
gave
his
address
as
had
been
requested
to
leave
his
hotel
in
atlantic
city
because
of
entertaining
in
his
room
a
lady
his
wife
then
he
started
and
his
fingers
trembled
for
directly
above
was
a
longer
paragraph
of
which
the
first
words
were
mr
and
leland
connage
are
announcing
the
engagement
of
their
daughter
rosalind
to
dawson
ryder
of
hartford
connecticut
he
dropped
the
paper
and
lay
down
on
his
bed
with
a
frightened
sinking
sensation
in
the
pit
of
his
stomach
she
was
gone
definitely
finally
gone
until
now
he
had
half
unconsciously
cherished
the
hope
deep
in
his
heart
that
some
day
she
would
need
him
and
send
for
him
cry
that
it
had
been
a
mistake
that
her
heart
ached
only
for
the
pain
she
had
caused
him
never
again
could
he
find
even
the
sombre
luxury
of
wanting
her
not
this
rosalind
harder
older
nor
any
beaten
broken
woman
that
his
imagination
brought
to
the
door
of
his
forties
amory
had
wanted
her
youth
the
fresh
radiance
of
her
mind
and
body
the
stuff
that
she
was
selling
now
once
and
for
all
so
far
as
he
was
concerned
young
rosalind
was
dead
a
day
later
came
a
crisp
terse
letter
from
barton
in
chicago
which
informed
him
that
as
three
more
companies
had
gone
into
the
hands
of
receivers
he
could
expect
for
the
present
no
further
remittances
last
of
all
on
a
dazed
sunday
night
a
telegram
told
him
of
monsignor
darcy
sudden
death
in
philadelphia
five
days
before
he
knew
then
what
it
was
that
he
had
perceived
among
the
curtains
of
the
room
in
atlantic
city
chapter
the
egotist
becomes
a
personage
a
fathom
deep
in
sleep
i
lie
with
old
desires
restrained
before
to
clamor
lifeward
with
a
cry
as
dark
flies
out
the
greying
door
and
so
in
quest
of
creeds
to
share
i
seek
assertive
day
again
but
old
monotony
is
there
endless
avenues
of
rain
oh
might
i
rise
again
might
i
throw
off
the
heat
of
that
old
wine
see
the
new
morning
mass
the
sky
with
fairy
towers
line
on
line
find
each
mirage
in
the
high
air
a
symbol
not
a
dream
again
but
old
monotony
is
there
endless
avenues
of
under
the
glass
portcullis
of
a
theatre
amory
stood
watching
the
first
great
drops
of
rain
splatter
down
and
flatten
to
dark
stains
on
the
sidewalk
the
air
became
gray
and
opalescent
a
solitary
light
suddenly
outlined
a
window
over
the
way
then
another
light
then
a
hundred
more
danced
and
glimmered
into
vision
under
his
feet
a
thick
skylight
turned
yellow
in
the
street
the
lamps
of
the
sent
out
glistening
sheens
along
the
already
black
pavement
the
unwelcome
november
rain
had
perversely
stolen
the
day
last
hour
and
pawned
it
with
that
ancient
fence
the
night
the
silence
of
the
theatre
behind
him
ended
with
a
curious
snapping
sound
followed
by
the
heavy
roaring
of
a
rising
crowd
and
the
interlaced
clatter
of
many
voices
the
matinee
was
over
he
stood
aside
edged
a
little
into
the
rain
to
let
the
throng
pass
a
small
boy
rushed
out
sniffed
in
the
damp
fresh
air
and
turned
up
the
collar
of
his
coat
came
three
or
four
couples
in
a
great
hurry
came
a
further
scattering
of
people
whose
eyes
as
they
emerged
glanced
invariably
first
at
the
wet
street
then
at
the
air
finally
at
the
dismal
sky
last
a
dense
strolling
mass
that
depressed
him
with
its
heavy
odor
compounded
of
the
tobacco
smell
of
the
men
and
the
fetid
sensuousness
of
stale
powder
on
women
after
the
thick
crowd
came
another
scattering
a
stray
a
man
on
crutches
finally
the
rattling
bang
of
folding
seats
inside
announced
that
the
ushers
were
at
work
new
york
seemed
not
so
much
awakening
as
turning
over
in
its
bed
pallid
men
rushed
by
pinching
together
their
a
great
swarm
of
tired
magpie
girls
from
a
crowded
along
with
shrieks
of
strident
laughter
three
to
an
umbrella
a
squad
of
marching
policemen
passed
already
miraculously
protected
by
oilskin
capes
the
rain
gave
amory
a
feeling
of
detachment
and
the
numerous
unpleasant
aspects
of
city
life
without
money
occurred
to
him
in
threatening
procession
there
was
the
ghastly
stinking
crush
of
the
subway
the
car
cards
thrusting
themselves
at
one
leering
out
like
dull
bores
who
grab
your
arm
with
another
story
the
querulous
worry
as
to
whether
some
one
is
leaning
on
you
a
man
deciding
not
to
give
his
seat
to
a
woman
hating
her
for
it
the
woman
hating
him
for
not
doing
it
at
worst
a
squalid
phantasmagoria
of
breath
and
old
cloth
on
human
bodies
and
the
smells
of
the
food
men
ate
at
best
just
people
too
hot
or
too
cold
tired
worried
he
pictured
the
rooms
where
these
people
lived
where
the
patterns
of
the
blistered
were
heavy
reiterated
sunflowers
on
green
and
yellow
backgrounds
where
there
were
tin
bathtubs
and
gloomy
hallways
and
verdureless
unnamable
spaces
in
back
of
the
buildings
where
even
love
dressed
as
seduction
a
sordid
murder
around
the
corner
illicit
motherhood
in
the
flat
above
and
always
there
was
the
economical
stuffiness
of
indoor
winter
and
the
long
summers
nightmares
of
perspiration
between
sticky
enveloping
walls
dirty
restaurants
where
careless
tired
people
helped
themselves
to
sugar
with
their
own
used
leaving
hard
brown
deposits
in
the
bowl
it
was
not
so
bad
where
there
were
only
men
or
else
only
women
it
was
when
they
were
vilely
herded
that
it
all
seemed
so
rotten
it
was
some
shame
that
women
gave
off
at
having
men
see
them
tired
and
poor
it
was
some
disgust
that
men
had
for
women
who
were
tired
and
poor
it
was
dirtier
than
any
he
had
seen
harder
to
contemplate
than
any
actual
hardship
moulded
of
mire
and
sweat
and
danger
it
was
an
atmosphere
wherein
birth
and
marriage
and
death
were
loathsome
secret
things
he
remembered
one
day
in
the
subway
when
a
delivery
boy
had
brought
in
a
great
funeral
wreath
of
fresh
flowers
how
the
smell
of
it
had
suddenly
cleared
the
air
and
given
every
one
in
the
car
a
momentary
glow
i
detest
poor
people
thought
amory
suddenly
i
hate
them
for
being
poor
poverty
may
have
been
beautiful
once
but
it
rotten
now
the
ugliest
thing
in
the
world
it
essentially
cleaner
to
be
corrupt
and
rich
than
it
is
to
be
innocent
and
he
seemed
to
see
again
a
figure
whose
significance
had
once
impressed
him
a
young
man
gazing
from
a
club
window
on
fifth
avenue
and
saying
something
to
his
companion
with
a
look
of
utter
disgust
probably
thought
amory
what
he
said
was
my
god
are
people
horrible
never
before
in
his
life
had
amory
considered
poor
people
he
thought
cynically
how
completely
he
was
lacking
in
all
human
sympathy
henry
had
found
in
these
people
romance
pathos
love
hate
amory
saw
only
coarseness
physical
filth
and
stupidity
he
made
no
never
any
more
did
he
reproach
himself
for
feelings
that
were
natural
and
sincere
he
accepted
all
his
reactions
as
a
part
of
him
unchangeable
unmoral
this
problem
of
poverty
transformed
magnified
attached
to
some
grander
more
dignified
attitude
might
some
day
even
be
his
problem
at
present
it
roused
only
his
profound
distaste
he
walked
over
to
fifth
avenue
dodging
the
blind
black
menace
of
umbrellas
and
standing
in
front
of
delmonico
hailed
an
buttoning
his
coat
closely
around
him
he
climbed
to
the
roof
where
he
rode
in
solitary
state
through
the
thin
persistent
rain
stung
into
alertness
by
the
cool
moisture
perpetually
reborn
on
his
cheek
somewhere
in
his
mind
a
conversation
began
rather
resumed
its
place
in
his
attention
it
was
composed
not
of
two
voices
but
of
one
which
acted
alike
as
questioner
and
answerer
well
what
the
situation
that
i
have
about
dollars
to
my
name
you
have
the
lake
geneva
estate
but
i
intend
to
keep
it
can
you
live
i
ca
imagine
not
being
able
to
people
make
money
in
books
and
i
found
that
i
can
always
do
the
things
that
people
do
in
books
really
they
are
the
only
things
i
can
do
be
definite
i
do
know
what
i
do
nor
have
i
much
curiosity
going
to
leave
new
york
for
good
it
a
bad
town
unless
you
on
top
of
it
do
you
want
a
lot
of
money
no
i
am
merely
afraid
of
being
poor
very
afraid
just
passively
afraid
where
are
you
drifting
do
ask
do
you
care
rather
i
do
want
to
commit
moral
suicide
have
you
no
interests
left
none
i
no
more
virtue
to
lose
just
as
a
cooling
pot
gives
off
heat
so
all
through
youth
and
adolescence
we
give
off
calories
of
virtue
that
what
called
ingenuousness
an
interesting
idea
that
why
a
good
man
going
wrong
attracts
people
they
stand
around
and
literally
at
the
calories
of
virtue
he
gives
off
sarah
makes
an
unsophisticated
remark
and
the
faces
simper
in
delight
how
the
poor
child
is
they
warming
themselves
at
her
virtue
but
sarah
sees
the
simper
and
never
makes
that
remark
again
only
she
feels
a
little
colder
after
that
all
your
calories
gone
all
of
them
i
beginning
to
warm
myself
at
other
people
virtue
are
you
corrupt
i
think
so
i
not
sure
i
not
sure
about
good
and
evil
at
all
any
more
is
that
a
bad
sign
in
itself
not
necessarily
what
would
be
the
test
of
corruption
becoming
really
insincere
calling
myself
not
such
a
bad
fellow
thinking
i
regretted
my
lost
youth
when
i
only
envy
the
delights
of
losing
it
youth
is
like
having
a
big
plate
of
candy
sentimentalists
think
they
want
to
be
in
the
pure
simple
state
they
were
in
before
they
ate
the
candy
they
do
they
just
want
the
fun
of
eating
it
all
over
again
the
matron
does
want
to
repeat
her
girlhood
she
wants
to
repeat
her
honeymoon
i
do
want
to
repeat
my
innocence
i
want
the
pleasure
of
losing
it
again
where
are
you
drifting
this
dialogue
merged
grotesquely
into
his
mind
most
familiar
state
a
grotesque
blending
of
desires
worries
exterior
impressions
and
physical
reactions
one

the

were
obscured
by
the
mist
and
dripping
trees
from
anything
but
the
swiftest
scrutiny
but
amory
had
finally
caught
sight
of
one
one
hundred
and
street
he
got
off
and
with
no
distinct
destination
followed
a
winding
descending
sidewalk
and
came
out
facing
the
river
in
particular
a
long
pier
and
a
partitioned
litter
of
shipyards
for
miniature
craft
small
launches
canoes
rowboats
and
catboats
he
turned
northward
and
followed
the
shore
jumped
a
small
wire
fence
and
found
himself
in
a
great
disorderly
yard
adjoining
a
dock
the
hulls
of
many
boats
in
various
stages
of
repair
were
around
him
he
smelled
sawdust
and
paint
and
the
scarcely
distinguishable
fiat
odor
of
the
hudson
a
man
approached
through
the
heavy
gloom
hello
said
amory
got
a
pass
no
is
this
private
this
is
the
hudson
river
sporting
and
yacht
oh
i
did
know
i
just
well
began
the
man
dubiously
i
go
if
you
want
me
the
man
made
noises
in
his
throat
and
passed
on
amory
seated
himself
on
an
overturned
boat
and
leaned
forward
thoughtfully
until
his
chin
rested
in
his
hand
misfortune
is
liable
to
make
me
a
damn
bad
man
he
said
slowly
in
the
drooping
hours
while
the
rain
drizzled
on
amory
looked
futilely
back
at
the
stream
of
his
life
all
its
glitterings
and
dirty
shallows
to
begin
with
he
was
still
afraid
not
physically
afraid
any
more
but
afraid
of
people
and
prejudice
and
misery
and
monotony
yet
deep
in
his
bitter
heart
he
wondered
if
he
was
after
all
worse
than
this
man
or
the
next
he
knew
that
he
could
sophisticate
himself
finally
into
saying
that
his
own
weakness
was
just
the
result
of
circumstances
and
environment
that
often
when
he
raged
at
himself
as
an
egotist
something
would
whisper
ingratiatingly
no
genius
that
was
one
manifestation
of
fear
that
voice
which
whispered
that
he
could
not
be
both
great
and
good
that
genius
was
the
exact
combination
of
those
inexplicable
grooves
and
twists
in
his
mind
that
any
discipline
would
curb
it
to
mediocrity
probably
more
than
any
concrete
vice
or
failing
amory
despised
his
own
personality
he
loathed
knowing
that
and
the
thousand
days
after
he
would
swell
pompously
at
a
compliment
and
sulk
at
an
ill
word
like
a
musician
or
a
actor
he
was
ashamed
of
the
fact
that
very
simple
and
honest
people
usually
distrusted
him
that
he
had
been
cruel
often
to
those
who
had
sunk
their
personalities
in
him
several
girls
and
a
man
here
and
there
through
college
that
he
had
been
an
evil
influence
on
people
who
had
followed
him
here
and
there
into
mental
adventures
from
which
he
alone
rebounded
unscathed
usually
on
nights
like
this
for
there
had
been
many
lately
he
could
escape
from
this
consuming
introspection
by
thinking
of
children
and
the
infinite
possibilities
of
children
he
leaned
and
listened
and
he
heard
a
startled
baby
awake
in
a
house
across
the
street
and
lend
a
tiny
whimper
to
the
still
night
quick
as
a
flash
he
turned
away
wondering
with
a
touch
of
panic
whether
something
in
the
brooding
despair
of
his
mood
had
made
a
darkness
in
its
tiny
soul
he
shivered
what
if
some
day
the
balance
was
overturned
and
he
became
a
thing
that
frightened
children
and
crept
into
rooms
in
the
dark
approached
dim
communion
with
those
phantoms
who
whispered
shadowy
secrets
to
the
mad
of
that
dark
continent
upon
the
moon
amory
smiled
a
bit
you
too
much
wrapped
up
in
yourself
he
heard
some
one
say
and
again
get
out
and
do
some
real
work
stop
worrying
he
fancied
a
possible
future
comment
of
his
own
yes
i
was
perhaps
an
egotist
in
youth
but
i
soon
found
it
made
me
morbid
to
think
too
much
about
suddenly
he
felt
an
overwhelming
desire
to
let
himself
go
to
the
devil
not
to
go
violently
as
a
gentleman
should
but
to
sink
safely
and
sensuously
out
of
sight
he
pictured
himself
in
an
adobe
house
in
mexico
on
a
couch
his
slender
artistic
fingers
closed
on
a
cigarette
while
he
listened
to
guitars
strumming
melancholy
undertones
to
an
dirge
of
castile
and
an
girl
caressed
his
hair
here
he
might
live
a
strange
litany
delivered
from
right
and
wrong
and
from
the
hound
of
heaven
and
from
every
god
except
the
exotic
mexican
one
who
was
pretty
slack
himself
and
rather
addicted
to
oriental
scents
delivered
from
success
and
hope
and
poverty
into
that
long
chute
of
indulgence
which
led
after
all
only
to
the
artificial
lake
of
death
there
were
so
many
places
where
one
might
deteriorate
pleasantly

and

would
seem
to
reflect
only
moods
of
passion
the
colors
of

still

once
he
had
been
miraculously
able
to
scent
evil
as
a
horse
detects
a
broken

at
night
but
the
man
with
the
queer
feet
in
room
had
diminished
to
the
aura
over

his
instinct
perceived
the
fetidness
of
poverty
but
no
longer
ferreted
out
the
deeper

there
were
no
more

there
were
no
more

burne
holiday
was
sunk
from
sight
as
though
he
had
never
lived
monsignor
was
dead
amory
had
grown
up
to
a
thousand
books
a
thousand
lies
he
had
listened
eagerly
to
people
who
pretended
to
know
who
knew
nothing
the
mystical
reveries
of
saints
that
had
once
filled
him
with
awe
in
the
still
hours
of
night
now
vaguely
repelled
him
the
byrons
and
brookes
who
had
defied
life
from
mountain
tops
were
in
the
end
but
flaneurs
and
poseurs
at
best
mistaking
the
shadow
of
courage
for
the
substance
of
wisdom
the
pageantry
of
his
disillusion
took
shape
in
a
procession
of
prophets
athenians
martyrs
saints
scientists
don
juans
jesuits
puritans
fausts
poets
pacifists
like
costumed
alumni
at
a
college
reunion
they
streamed
before
him
as
their
dreams
personalities
and
creeds
had
in
turn
thrown
colored
lights
on
his
soul
each
had
tried
to
express
the
glory
of
life
and
the
tremendous
significance
of
man
each
had
boasted
of
synchronizing
what
had
gone
before
into
his
own
rickety
generalities
each
had
depended
after
all
on
the
set
stage
and
the
convention
of
the
theatre
which
is
that
man
in
his
hunger
for
faith
will
feed
his
mind
with
the
nearest
and
most
convenient
food

of
whom
he
had
expected
so
much
whose
beauty
he
had
hoped
to
transmute
into
modes
of
art
whose
unfathomable
instincts
marvellously
incoherent
and
inarticulate
he
had
thought
to
perpetuate
in
terms
of
experience
had
become
merely
consecrations
to
their
own
posterity
isabelle
clara
rosalind
eleanor
were
all
removed
by
their
very
beauty
around
which
men
had
swarmed
from
the
possibility
of
contributing
anything
but
a
sick
heart
and
a
page
of
puzzled
words
to
write
amory
based
his
loss
of
faith
in
help
from
others
on
several
sweeping
syllogisms
granted
that
his
generation
however
bruised
and
decimated
from
this
victorian
war
were
the
heirs
of
progress
waving
aside
petty
differences
of
conclusions
which
although
they
might
occasionally
cause
the
deaths
of
several
millions
of
young
men
might
be
explained
away
supposing
that
after
all
bernard
shaw
and
bernhardi
bonar
law
and
were
mutual
heirs
of
progress
if
only
in
agreeing
against
the
ducking
of
witches
waiving
the
antitheses
and
approaching
individually
these
men
who
seemed
to
be
the
leaders
he
was
repelled
by
the
discrepancies
and
contradictions
in
the
men
themselves
there
was
for
example
thornton
hancock
respected
by
half
the
intellectual
world
as
an
authority
on
life
a
man
who
had
verified
and
believed
the
code
he
lived
by
an
educator
of
educators
an
adviser
to
presidents
yet
amory
knew
that
this
man
had
in
his
heart
leaned
on
the
priest
of
another
religion
and
monsignor
upon
whom
a
cardinal
rested
had
moments
of
strange
and
horrible
insecurity
inexplicable
in
a
religion
that
explained
even
disbelief
in
terms
of
its
own
faith
if
you
doubted
the
devil
it
was
the
devil
that
made
you
doubt
him
amory
had
seen
monsignor
go
to
the
houses
of
stolid
philistines
read
popular
novels
furiously
saturate
himself
in
routine
to
escape
from
that
horror
and
this
priest
a
little
wiser
somewhat
purer
had
been
amory
knew
not
essentially
older
than
he
amory
was
alone
he
had
escaped
from
a
small
enclosure
into
a
great
labyrinth
he
was
where
goethe
was
when
he
began
faust
he
was
where
conrad
was
when
he
wrote
almayer
amory
said
to
himself
that
there
were
essentially
two
sorts
of
people
who
through
natural
clarity
or
disillusion
left
the
enclosure
and
sought
the
labyrinth
there
were
men
like
wells
and
plato
who
had
half
unconsciously
a
strange
hidden
orthodoxy
who
would
accept
for
themselves
only
what
could
be
accepted
for
all
men
incurable
romanticists
who
never
for
all
their
efforts
could
enter
the
labyrinth
as
stark
souls
there
were
on
the
other
hand
pioneering
personalities
samuel
butler
renan
voltaire
who
progressed
much
slower
yet
eventually
much
further
not
in
the
direct
pessimistic
line
of
speculative
philosophy
but
concerned
in
the
eternal
attempt
to
attach
a
positive
value
to
life
amory
stopped
he
began
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
to
have
a
strong
distrust
of
all
generalities
and
epigrams
they
were
too
easy
too
dangerous
to
the
public
mind
yet
all
thought
usually
reached
the
public
after
thirty
years
in
some
such
form
benson
and
chesterton
had
popularized
huysmans
and
newman
shaw
had
nietzsche
and
ibsen
and
schopenhauer
the
man
in
the
street
heard
the
conclusions
of
dead
genius
through
some
one
else
clever
paradoxes
and
didactic
epigrams
life
was
a
damned
muddle
a
football
game
with
every
one
and
the
referee
gotten
rid
of
every
one
claiming
the
referee
would
have
been
on
his
side
progress
was
a
labyrinth
people
plunging
blindly
in
and
then
rushing
wildly
back
shouting
that
they
had
found
it
the
invisible
king
the
elan
vital
the
principle
of
evolution
writing
a
book
starting
a
war
founding
a
school
amory
even
had
he
not
been
a
selfish
man
would
have
started
all
inquiries
with
himself
he
was
his
own
best
example
sitting
in
the
rain
a
human
creature
of
sex
and
pride
foiled
by
chance
and
his
own
temperament
of
the
balm
of
love
and
children
preserved
to
help
in
building
up
the
living
consciousness
of
the
race
in
and
loneliness
and
disillusion
he
came
to
the
entrance
of
the
labyrinth
another
dawn
flung
itself
across
the
river
a
belated
taxi
hurried
along
the
street
its
lamps
still
shining
like
burning
eyes
in
a
face
white
from
a
night
carouse
a
melancholy
siren
sounded
far
down
the
river
monsignor
amory
kept
thinking
how
monsignor
would
have
enjoyed
his
own
funeral
it
was
magnificently
catholic
and
liturgical
bishop
sang
solemn
high
mass
and
the
cardinal
gave
the
final
absolutions
thornton
hancock
lawrence
the
british
and
italian
ambassadors
the
papal
delegate
and
a
host
of
friends
and
priests
were
there
yet
the
inexorable
shears
had
cut
through
all
these
threads
that
monsignor
had
gathered
into
his
hands
to
amory
it
was
a
haunting
grief
to
see
him
lying
in
his
coffin
with
closed
hands
upon
his
purple
vestments
his
face
had
not
changed
and
as
he
never
knew
he
was
dying
it
showed
no
pain
or
fear
it
was
amory
dear
old
friend
his
and
the
others
for
the
church
was
full
of
people
with
daft
staring
faces
the
most
exalted
seeming
the
most
stricken
the
cardinal
like
an
archangel
in
cope
and
mitre
sprinkled
the
holy
water
the
organ
broke
into
sound
the
choir
began
to
sing
the
requiem
eternam
all
these
people
grieved
because
they
had
to
some
extent
depended
upon
monsignor
their
grief
was
more
than
sentiment
for
the
crack
in
his
voice
or
a
certain
break
in
his
walk
as
wells
put
it
these
people
had
leaned
on
monsignor
faith
his
way
of
finding
cheer
of
making
religion
a
thing
of
lights
and
shadows
making
all
light
and
shadow
merely
aspects
of
god
people
felt
safe
when
he
was
near
of
amory
attempted
sacrifice
had
been
born
merely
the
full
realization
of
his
disillusion
but
of
monsignor
funeral
was
born
the
romantic
elf
who
was
to
enter
the
labyrinth
with
him
he
found
something
that
he
wanted
had
always
wanted
and
always
would
want
not
to
be
admired
as
he
had
feared
not
to
be
loved
as
he
had
made
himself
believe
but
to
be
necessary
to
people
to
be
indispensable
he
remembered
the
sense
of
security
he
had
found
in
burne
life
opened
up
in
one
of
its
amazing
bursts
of
radiance
and
amory
suddenly
and
permanently
rejected
an
old
epigram
that
had
been
playing
listlessly
in
his
mind
very
few
things
matter
and
nothing
matters
very
on
the
contrary
amory
felt
an
immense
desire
to
give
people
a
sense
of
security
the
big
man
with
goggles
on
the
day
that
amory
started
on
his
walk
to
princeton
the
sky
was
a
colorless
vault
cool
high
and
barren
of
the
threat
of
rain
it
was
a
gray
day
that
least
fleshly
of
all
weathers
a
day
of
dreams
and
far
hopes
and
clear
visions
it
was
a
day
easily
associated
with
those
abstract
truths
and
purities
that
dissolve
in
the
sunshine
or
fade
out
in
mocking
laughter
by
the
light
of
the
moon
the
trees
and
clouds
were
carved
in
classical
severity
the
sounds
of
the
countryside
had
harmonized
to
a
monotone
metallic
as
a
trumpet
breathless
as
the
grecian
urn
the
day
had
put
amory
in
such
a
contemplative
mood
that
he
caused
much
annoyance
to
several
motorists
who
were
forced
to
slow
up
considerably
or
else
run
him
down
so
engrossed
in
his
thoughts
was
he
that
he
was
scarcely
surprised
at
that
strange
phenomenon
cordiality
manifested
within
fifty
miles
of
manhattan
when
a
passing
car
slowed
down
beside
him
and
a
voice
hailed
him
he
looked
up
and
saw
a
magnificent
locomobile
in
which
sat
two
men
one
of
them
small
and
anxious
looking
apparently
an
artificial
growth
on
the
other
who
was
large
and
begoggled
and
imposing
do
you
want
a
lift
asked
the
apparently
artificial
growth
glancing
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
at
the
imposing
man
as
if
for
some
habitual
silent
corroboration
you
bet
i
do
the
chauffeur
swung
open
the
door
and
climbing
in
amory
settled
himself
in
the
middle
of
the
back
seat
he
took
in
his
companions
curiously
the
chief
characteristic
of
the
big
man
seemed
to
be
a
great
confidence
in
himself
set
off
against
a
tremendous
boredom
with
everything
around
him
that
part
of
his
face
which
protruded
under
the
goggles
was
what
is
generally
termed
strong
rolls
of
not
undignified
fat
had
collected
near
his
chin
somewhere
above
was
a
wide
thin
mouth
and
the
rough
model
for
a
roman
nose
and
below
his
shoulders
collapsed
without
a
struggle
into
the
powerful
bulk
of
his
chest
and
belly
he
was
excellently
and
quietly
dressed
amory
noticed
that
he
was
inclined
to
stare
straight
at
the
back
of
the
chauffeur
head
as
if
speculating
steadily
but
hopelessly
some
baffling
hirsute
problem
the
smaller
man
was
remarkable
only
for
his
complete
submersion
in
the
personality
of
the
other
he
was
of
that
lower
secretarial
type
who
at
forty
have
engraved
upon
their
business
cards
assistant
to
the
president
and
without
a
sigh
consecrate
the
rest
of
their
lives
to
mannerisms
going
far
asked
the
smaller
man
in
a
pleasant
disinterested
way
quite
a
hiking
for
exercise
no
responded
amory
succinctly
i
walking
because
i
ca
afford
to
then
again
are
you
looking
for
work
because
there
lots
of
work
he
continued
rather
testily
all
this
talk
of
lack
of
work
the
west
is
especially
short
of
he
expressed
the
west
with
a
sweeping
lateral
gesture
amory
nodded
politely
have
you
a
trade
no
amory
had
no
trade
clerk
eh
no
amory
was
not
a
clerk
whatever
your
line
is
said
the
little
man
seeming
to
agree
wisely
with
something
amory
had
said
now
is
the
time
of
opportunity
and
business
he
glanced
again
toward
the
big
man
as
a
lawyer
grilling
a
witness
glances
involuntarily
at
the
jury
amory
decided
that
he
must
say
something
and
for
the
life
of
him
could
think
of
only
one
thing
to
say
of
course
i
want
a
great
lot
of
money
the
little
man
laughed
mirthlessly
but
conscientiously
that
what
every
one
wants
nowadays
but
they
do
want
to
work
for
a
very
natural
healthy
desire
almost
all
normal
people
want
to
be
rich
without
great
effort
except
the
financiers
in
problem
plays
who
want
to
their
way
through
do
you
want
easy
money
of
course
not
said
the
secretary
indignantly
but
continued
amory
disregarding
him
being
very
poor
at
present
i
am
contemplating
socialism
as
possibly
my
both
men
glanced
at
him
curiously
these
bomb
throwers
the
little
man
ceased
as
words
lurched
ponderously
from
the
big
man
chest
if
i
thought
you
were
a
bomb
thrower
i
run
you
over
to
the
newark
jail
that
what
i
think
of
amory
laughed
what
are
you
asked
the
big
man
one
of
these
parlor
bolsheviks
one
of
these
idealists
i
must
say
i
fail
to
see
the
difference
the
idealists
loaf
around
and
write
the
stuff
that
stirs
up
the
poor
well
said
amory
if
being
an
idealist
is
both
safe
and
lucrative
i
might
try
what
your
difficulty
lost
your
job
not
exactly
but
well
call
it
what
was
it
writing
copy
for
an
advertising
lots
of
money
in
amory
smiled
discreetly
oh
i
admit
there
money
in
it
eventually
talent
does
starve
any
more
even
art
gets
enough
to
eat
these
days
artists
draw
your
magazine
covers
write
your
advertisements
hash
out
for
your
theatres
by
the
great
commercializing
of
printing
you
found
a
harmless
polite
occupation
for
every
genius
who
might
have
carved
his
own
niche
but
beware
the
artist
who
an
intellectual
also
the
artist
who
does
fit
the
rousseau
the
tolstoi
the
samuel
butler
the
amory
blaine
who
he
demanded
the
little
man
suspiciously
well
said
amory
he
a
he
an
intellectual
personage
not
very
well
known
at
the
little
man
laughed
his
conscientious
laugh
and
stopped
rather
suddenly
as
amory
burning
eyes
turned
on
him
what
are
you
laughing
at
these
people
do
you
know
what
it
means
the
little
man
eyes
twitched
nervously
why
it
means
it
means
brainy
and
interrupted
amory
it
means
having
an
active
knowledge
of
the
race
amory
decided
to
be
very
rude
he
turned
to
the
big
man
the
young
man
he
indicated
the
secretary
with
his
thumb
and
said
young
man
as
one
says
with
no
implication
of
youth
has
the
usual
muddled
connotation
of
all
popular
you
object
to
the
fact
that
capital
controls
printing
said
the
big
man
fixing
him
with
his
goggles
yes
and
i
object
to
doing
their
mental
work
for
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
root
of
all
the
business
i
saw
around
me
consisted
in
overworking
and
underpaying
a
bunch
of
dubs
who
submitted
to
here
now
said
the
big
man
you
have
to
admit
that
the
laboring
man
is
certainly
highly
paid
five
and
six
hour
days
it
ridiculous
you
ca
buy
an
honest
day
work
from
a
man
in
the
you
brought
it
on
yourselves
insisted
amory
you
people
never
make
concessions
until
they
wrung
out
of
what
people
your
class
the
class
i
belonged
to
until
recently
those
who
by
inheritance
or
industry
or
brains
or
dishonesty
have
become
the
moneyed
do
you
imagine
that
if
that
over
there
had
the
money
be
any
more
willing
to
give
it
up
no
but
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
the
older
man
considered
no
i
admit
it
has
it
rather
sounds
as
if
it
had
in
fact
continued
amory
he
be
worse
the
lower
classes
are
narrower
less
pleasant
and
personally
more
selfish
certainly
more
stupid
but
all
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
just
exactly
what
is
the
question
here
amory
had
to
pause
to
consider
exactly
what
the
question
was
amory
coins
a
phrase
when
life
gets
hold
of
a
brainy
man
of
fair
education
began
amory
slowly
that
is
when
he
marries
he
becomes
nine
times
out
of
ten
a
conservative
as
far
as
existing
social
conditions
are
concerned
he
may
be
unselfish
even
just
in
his
own
way
but
his
first
job
is
to
provide
and
to
hold
fast
his
wife
shoos
him
on
from
ten
thousand
a
year
to
twenty
thousand
a
year
on
and
on
in
an
enclosed
treadmill
that
has
any
windows
he
done
life
got
him
he
no
help
he
a
spiritually
married
amory
paused
and
decided
that
it
was
such
a
bad
phrase
some
men
he
continued
escape
the
grip
maybe
their
wives
have
no
social
ambitions
maybe
they
hit
a
sentence
or
two
in
a
book
that
pleased
them
maybe
they
started
on
the
treadmill
as
i
did
and
were
knocked
off
anyway
they
the
congressmen
you
bribe
the
presidents
who
are
politicians
the
writers
speakers
scientists
statesmen
who
are
just
popular
for
a
women
and
he
the
natural
radical
yes
said
amory
he
may
vary
from
the
disillusioned
critic
like
old
thornton
hancock
all
the
way
to
trotsky
now
this
spiritually
unmarried
man
has
direct
power
for
unfortunately
the
spiritually
married
man
as
a
of
his
money
chase
has
garnered
in
the
great
newspaper
the
popular
magazine
the
influential
weekly
so
that
mrs
newspaper
magazine
weekly
can
have
a
better
limousine
than
those
oil
people
across
the
street
or
those
cement
people
the
why
not
it
makes
wealthy
men
the
keepers
of
the
world
intellectual
conscience
and
of
course
a
man
who
has
money
under
one
set
of
social
institutions
quite
naturally
ca
risk
his
family
happiness
by
letting
the
clamor
for
another
appear
in
his
but
it
appears
said
the
big
man
where
in
the
discredited
mediums
rotten
all
right
go
well
my
first
point
is
that
through
a
mixture
of
conditions
of
which
the
family
is
the
first
there
are
these
two
sorts
of
brains
one
sort
takes
human
nature
as
it
finds
it
uses
its
timidity
its
weakness
and
its
strength
for
its
own
ends
opposed
is
the
man
who
being
spiritually
unmarried
continually
seeks
for
new
systems
that
will
control
or
counteract
human
nature
his
problem
is
harder
it
is
not
life
complicated
it
the
struggle
to
guide
and
control
life
that
is
his
struggle
he
is
a
part
of
progress
the
spiritually
married
man
is
the
big
man
produced
three
big
cigars
and
proffered
them
on
his
huge
palm
the
little
man
took
one
amory
shook
his
head
and
reached
for
a
cigarette
go
on
talking
said
the
big
man
i
been
wanting
to
hear
one
of
you
going
faster
modern
life
began
amory
again
changes
no
longer
century
by
century
but
year
by
year
ten
times
faster
than
it
ever
has
before
populations
doubling
civilizations
unified
more
closely
with
other
civilizations
economic
interdependence
racial
questions
and
we
along
my
idea
is
that
we
got
to
go
very
much
he
slightly
emphasized
the
last
words
and
the
chauffeur
unconsciously
increased
the
speed
of
the
car
amory
and
the
big
man
laughed
the
little
man
laughed
too
after
a
pause
every
child
said
amory
should
have
an
equal
start
if
his
father
can
endow
him
with
a
good
physique
and
his
mother
with
some
common
sense
in
his
early
education
that
should
be
his
heritage
if
the
father
give
him
a
good
physique
if
the
mother
has
spent
in
chasing
men
the
years
in
which
she
should
have
been
preparing
herself
to
educate
her
children
so
much
the
worse
for
the
child
he
should
be
artificially
bolstered
up
with
money
sent
to
these
horrible
tutoring
schools
dragged
through
college
every
boy
ought
to
have
an
equal
all
right
said
the
big
man
his
goggles
indicating
neither
approval
nor
objection
next
i
have
a
fair
trial
of
government
ownership
of
all
that
been
proven
a
no
it
merely
failed
if
we
had
government
ownership
we
have
the
best
analytical
business
minds
in
the
government
working
for
something
besides
themselves
we
have
mackays
instead
of
burlesons
we
have
morgans
in
the
treasury
department
we
have
hills
running
interstate
commerce
we
have
the
best
lawyers
in
the
they
would
give
their
best
efforts
for
nothing
mcadoo
no
said
amory
shaking
his
head
money
is
the
only
stimulus
that
brings
out
the
best
that
in
a
man
even
in
you
said
a
while
ago
that
it
it
is
right
now
but
if
it
were
made
illegal
to
have
more
than
a
certain
amount
the
best
men
would
all
flock
for
the
one
other
reward
which
attracts
humanity
the
big
man
made
a
sound
that
was
very
like
that
the
silliest
thing
you
said
no
it
is
silly
it
quite
plausible
if
you
gone
to
college
you
have
been
struck
by
the
fact
that
the
men
there
would
work
twice
as
hard
for
any
one
of
a
hundred
petty
honors
as
those
other
men
did
who
were
earning
their
way
kids
child
play
scoffed
his
antagonist
not
by
a
darned
sight
unless
we
all
children
did
you
ever
see
a
grown
man
when
he
trying
for
a
secret
society
or
a
rising
family
whose
name
is
up
at
some
club
they
jump
when
they
hear
the
sound
of
the
word
the
idea
that
to
make
a
man
work
you
got
to
hold
gold
in
front
of
his
eyes
is
a
growth
not
an
axiom
we
done
that
for
so
long
that
we
forgotten
there
any
other
way
we
made
a
world
where
that
necessary
let
me
tell
you
amory
became
emphatic
if
there
were
ten
men
insured
against
either
wealth
or
starvation
and
offered
a
green
ribbon
for
five
hours
work
a
day
and
a
blue
ribbon
for
ten
work
a
day
nine
out
of
ten
of
them
would
be
trying
for
the
blue
ribbon
that
competitive
instinct
only
wants
a
badge
if
the
size
of
their
house
is
the
badge
they
sweat
their
heads
off
for
that
if
it
only
a
blue
ribbon
i
damn
near
believe
they
work
just
as
hard
they
have
in
other
i
do
agree
with
i
know
it
said
amory
nodding
sadly
it
does
matter
any
more
though
i
think
these
people
are
going
to
come
and
take
what
they
want
pretty
a
fierce
hiss
came
from
the
little
man
ah
but
you
taught
them
their
the
big
man
shook
his
head
in
this
country
there
are
enough
property
owners
not
to
permit
that
sort
of
amory
wished
he
knew
the
statistics
of
property
owners
and
owners
he
decided
to
change
the
subject
but
the
big
man
was
aroused
when
you
talk
of
things
away
you
on
dangerous
how
can
they
get
it
without
taking
it
for
years
people
have
been
stalled
off
with
promises
socialism
may
not
be
progress
but
the
threat
of
the
red
flag
is
certainly
the
inspiring
force
of
all
reform
got
to
be
sensational
to
get
russia
is
your
example
of
a
beneficent
violence
i
suppose
quite
possibly
admitted
amory
of
course
it
overflowing
just
as
the
french
revolution
did
but
i
no
doubt
that
it
really
a
great
experiment
and
well
worth
do
you
believe
in
moderation
you
wo
listen
to
the
moderates
and
it
almost
too
late
the
truth
is
that
the
public
has
done
one
of
those
startling
and
amazing
things
that
they
do
about
once
in
a
hundred
years
they
seized
an
what
is
it
that
however
the
brains
and
abilities
of
men
may
differ
their
stomachs
are
essentially
the
the
little
man
gets
his
if
you
took
all
the
money
in
the
world
said
the
little
man
with
much
profundity
and
divided
it
up
in
equ
oh
shut
up
said
amory
briskly
and
paying
no
attention
to
the
little
man
enraged
stare
he
went
on
with
his
argument
the
human
stomach
he
began
but
the
big
man
interrupted
rather
impatiently
i
letting
you
talk
you
know
he
said
but
please
avoid
stomachs
i
been
feeling
mine
all
day
anyway
i
do
agree
with
you
said
government
ownership
is
the
basis
of
your
whole
argument
and
it
invariably
a
beehive
of
corruption
men
wo
work
for
blue
ribbons
that
all
when
he
ceased
the
little
man
spoke
up
with
a
determined
nod
as
if
resolved
this
time
to
have
his
say
out
there
are
certain
things
which
are
human
nature
he
asserted
with
an
look
which
always
have
been
and
always
will
be
which
be
amory
looked
from
the
small
man
to
the
big
man
helplessly
listen
to
that
what
makes
me
discouraged
with
progress
to
that
i
can
name
offhand
over
one
hundred
natural
phenomena
that
have
been
changed
by
the
will
of
man
a
hundred
instincts
in
man
that
have
been
wiped
out
or
are
now
held
in
check
by
civilization
what
this
man
here
just
said
has
been
for
thousands
of
years
the
last
refuge
of
the
associated
of
the
world
it
negates
the
efforts
of
every
scientist
statesman
moralist
reformer
doctor
and
philosopher
that
ever
gave
his
life
to
humanity
service
it
a
flat
impeachment
of
all
that
worth
while
in
human
nature
every
person
over
years
old
who
makes
that
statement
in
cold
blood
ought
to
be
deprived
of
the
the
little
man
leaned
back
against
the
seat
his
face
purple
with
rage
amory
continued
addressing
his
remarks
to
the
big
man
these
men
such
as
your
friend
here
who
they
think
every
question
that
comes
up
you
find
his
type
in
the
usual
ghastly
muddle
one
minute
it
brutality
and
inhumanity
of
these
prussians
the
next
it
ought
to
exterminate
the
whole
german
people
they
always
believe
that
are
in
a
bad
way
now
but
they
any
faith
in
these
idealists
one
minute
they
call
wilson
a
dreamer
not
practical
a
year
later
they
rail
at
him
for
making
his
dreams
realities
they
have
clear
logical
ideas
on
one
single
subject
except
a
sturdy
stolid
opposition
to
all
change
they
do
think
uneducated
people
should
be
highly
paid
but
they
see
that
if
they
do
pay
the
uneducated
people
their
children
are
going
to
be
uneducated
too
and
we
going
round
and
round
in
a
circle
that
is
the
great
middle
class
the
big
man
with
a
broad
grin
on
his
face
leaned
over
and
smiled
at
the
little
man
you
catching
it
pretty
heavy
garvin
how
do
you
feel
the
little
man
made
an
attempt
to
smile
and
act
as
if
the
whole
matter
were
so
ridiculous
as
to
be
beneath
notice
but
amory
was
not
through
the
theory
that
people
are
fit
to
govern
themselves
rests
on
this
man
if
he
can
be
educated
to
think
clearly
concisely
and
logically
freed
of
his
habit
of
taking
refuge
in
platitudes
and
prejudices
and
sentimentalisms
then
i
a
militant
socialist
if
he
ca
then
i
do
think
it
matters
much
what
happens
to
man
or
his
systems
now
or
i
am
both
interested
and
amused
said
the
big
man
you
are
very
which
may
only
mean
that
i
have
neither
been
corrupted
nor
made
timid
by
contemporary
experience
i
possess
the
most
valuable
experience
the
experience
of
the
race
for
in
spite
of
going
to
college
i
managed
to
pick
up
a
good
you
talk
it
not
all
rubbish
cried
amory
passionately
this
is
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
argued
socialism
it
the
only
panacea
i
know
restless
my
whole
generation
is
restless
i
sick
of
a
system
where
the
richest
man
gets
the
most
beautiful
girl
if
he
wants
her
where
the
artist
without
an
income
has
to
sell
his
talents
to
a
button
manufacturer
even
if
i
had
no
talents
i
not
be
content
to
work
ten
years
condemned
either
to
celibacy
or
a
furtive
indulgence
to
give
some
man
son
an
but
if
you
not
sure
that
does
matter
exclaimed
amory
my
position
could
be
worse
a
social
revolution
might
land
me
on
top
of
course
i
selfish
it
seems
to
me
i
been
a
fish
out
of
water
in
too
many
outworn
systems
i
was
probably
one
of
the
two
dozen
men
in
my
class
at
college
who
got
a
decent
education
still
they
let
any
flathead
play
football
and
was
ineligible
because
some
silly
old
men
thought
we
should
profit
by
conic
sections
i
loathed
the
army
i
loathed
business
i
in
love
with
change
and
i
killed
my
conscience
so
you
go
along
crying
that
we
must
go
that
at
least
is
true
amory
insisted
reform
wo
catch
up
to
the
needs
of
civilization
unless
it
made
to
a
policy
is
like
spoiling
a
child
by
saying
he
turn
out
all
right
in
the
end
he
will
if
he
made
but
you
do
believe
all
this
socialist
patter
you
i
do
know
until
i
talked
to
you
i
had
thought
seriously
about
it
i
was
sure
of
half
of
what
i
you
puzzle
me
said
the
big
man
but
you
all
alike
they
say
bernard
shaw
in
spite
of
his
doctrines
is
the
most
exacting
of
all
dramatists
about
his
royalties
to
the
last
well
said
amory
i
simply
state
that
i
a
product
of
a
versatile
mind
in
a
restless
generation
with
every
reason
to
throw
my
mind
and
pen
in
with
the
radicals
even
if
deep
in
my
heart
i
thought
we
were
all
blind
atoms
in
a
world
as
limited
as
a
stroke
of
a
pendulum
i
and
my
sort
would
struggle
against
tradition
try
at
least
to
displace
old
cants
with
new
ones
i
thought
i
was
right
about
life
at
various
times
but
faith
is
difficult
one
thing
i
know
if
living
is
a
seeking
for
the
grail
it
may
be
a
damned
amusing
for
a
minute
neither
spoke
and
then
the
big
man
asked
what
was
your
university
the
big
man
became
suddenly
interested
the
expression
of
his
goggles
altered
slightly
i
sent
my
son
to
did
you
perhaps
you
knew
him
his
name
was
jesse
ferrenby
he
was
killed
last
year
in
i
knew
him
very
well
in
fact
he
was
one
of
my
particular
he
was
a
quite
a
fine
boy
we
were
very
amory
began
to
perceive
a
resemblance
between
the
father
and
the
dead
son
and
he
told
himself
that
there
had
been
all
along
a
sense
of
familiarity
jesse
ferrenby
the
man
who
in
college
had
borne
off
the
crown
that
he
had
aspired
to
it
was
all
so
far
away
what
little
boys
they
had
been
working
for
blue
ribbons
the
car
slowed
up
at
the
entrance
to
a
great
estate
ringed
around
by
a
huge
hedge
and
a
tall
iron
fence
wo
you
come
in
for
lunch
amory
shook
his
head
thank
you
ferrenby
but
i
got
to
get
the
big
man
held
out
his
hand
amory
saw
that
the
fact
that
he
had
known
jesse
more
than
outweighed
any
disfavor
he
had
created
by
his
opinions
what
ghosts
were
people
with
which
to
work
even
the
little
man
insisted
on
shaking
hands
shouted
ferrenby
as
the
car
turned
the
corner
and
started
up
the
drive
good
luck
to
you
and
bad
luck
to
your
same
to
you
sir
cried
amory
smiling
and
waving
his
hand
out
of
the
fire
out
of
the
little
room
eight
hours
from
princeton
amory
sat
down
by
the
jersey
roadside
and
looked
at
the
country
nature
as
a
rather
coarse
phenomenon
composed
largely
of
flowers
that
when
closely
inspected
appeared
and
of
ants
that
endlessly
traversed
blades
of
grass
was
always
disillusioning
nature
represented
by
skies
and
waters
and
far
horizons
was
more
likable
frost
and
the
promise
of
winter
thrilled
him
now
made
him
think
of
a
wild
battle
between
regis
and
groton
ages
ago
seven
years
ago
and
of
an
autumn
day
in
france
twelve
months
before
when
he
had
lain
in
tall
grass
his
platoon
flattened
down
close
around
him
waiting
to
tap
the
shoulders
of
a
lewis
gunner
he
saw
the
two
pictures
together
with
somewhat
the
same
primitive
exaltation
two
games
he
had
played
differing
in
quality
of
acerbity
linked
in
a
way
that
differed
them
from
rosalind
or
the
subject
of
labyrinths
which
were
after
all
the
business
of
life
i
am
selfish
he
thought
this
is
not
a
quality
that
will
change
when
i
human
suffering
or
my
parents
or
others
this
selfishness
is
not
only
part
of
me
it
is
the
most
living
part
it
is
by
somehow
transcending
rather
than
by
avoiding
that
selfishness
that
i
can
bring
poise
and
balance
into
my
life
there
is
no
virtue
of
unselfishness
that
i
can
not
use
i
can
make
sacrifices
be
charitable
give
to
a
friend
endure
for
a
friend
lay
down
my
life
for
a
friend
all
because
these
things
may
be
the
best
possible
expression
of
myself
yet
i
have
not
one
drop
of
the
milk
of
human
the
problem
of
evil
had
solidified
for
amory
into
the
problem
of
sex
he
was
beginning
to
identify
evil
with
the
strong
phallic
worship
in
brooke
and
the
early
wells
inseparably
linked
with
evil
was
beauty
beauty
still
a
constant
rising
tumult
soft
in
eleanor
voice
in
an
old
song
at
night
rioting
deliriously
through
life
like
superimposed
waterfalls
half
rhythm
half
darkness
amory
knew
that
every
time
he
had
reached
toward
it
longingly
it
had
leered
out
at
him
with
the
grotesque
face
of
evil
beauty
of
great
art
beauty
of
all
joy
most
of
all
the
beauty
of
women
after
all
it
had
too
many
associations
with
license
and
indulgence
weak
things
were
often
beautiful
weak
things
were
never
good
and
in
this
new
loneness
of
his
that
had
been
selected
for
what
greatness
he
might
achieve
beauty
must
be
relative
or
itself
a
harmony
it
would
make
only
a
discord
in
a
sense
this
gradual
renunciation
of
beauty
was
the
second
step
after
his
disillusion
had
been
made
complete
he
felt
that
he
was
leaving
behind
him
his
chance
of
being
a
certain
type
of
artist
it
seemed
so
much
more
important
to
be
a
certain
sort
of
man
his
mind
turned
a
corner
suddenly
and
he
found
himself
thinking
of
the
catholic
church
the
idea
was
strong
in
him
that
there
was
a
certain
intrinsic
lack
in
those
to
whom
orthodox
religion
was
necessary
and
religion
to
amory
meant
the
church
of
rome
quite
conceivably
it
was
an
empty
ritual
but
it
was
seemingly
the
only
assimilative
traditionary
bulwark
against
the
decay
of
morals
until
the
great
mobs
could
be
educated
into
a
moral
sense
some
one
must
cry
thou
shalt
not
yet
any
acceptance
was
for
the
present
impossible
he
wanted
time
and
the
absence
of
ulterior
pressure
he
wanted
to
keep
the
tree
without
ornaments
realize
fully
the
direction
and
momentum
of
this
new
start
the
afternoon
waned
from
the
purging
good
of
three
to
the
golden
beauty
of
four
afterward
he
walked
through
the
dull
ache
of
a
setting
sun
when
even
the
clouds
seemed
bleeding
and
at
twilight
he
came
to
a
graveyard
there
was
a
dusky
dreamy
smell
of
flowers
and
the
ghost
of
a
new
moon
in
the
sky
and
shadows
everywhere
on
an
impulse
he
considered
trying
to
open
the
door
of
a
rusty
iron
vault
built
into
the
side
of
a
hill
a
vault
washed
clean
and
covered
with
weepy
flowers
that
might
have
grown
from
dead
eyes
sticky
to
the
touch
with
a
sickening
odor
amory
wanted
to
feel
william
dayfield
he
wondered
that
graves
ever
made
people
consider
life
in
vain
somehow
he
could
find
nothing
hopeless
in
having
lived
all
the
broken
columns
and
clasped
hands
and
doves
and
angels
meant
romances
he
fancied
that
in
a
hundred
years
he
would
like
having
young
people
speculate
as
to
whether
his
eyes
were
brown
or
blue
and
he
hoped
quite
passionately
that
his
grave
would
have
about
it
an
air
of
many
many
years
ago
it
seemed
strange
that
out
of
a
row
of
union
soldiers
two
or
three
made
him
think
of
dead
loves
and
dead
lovers
when
they
were
exactly
like
the
rest
even
to
the
yellowish
moss
long
after
midnight
the
towers
and
spires
of
princeton
were
visible
with
here
and
there
a
light
and
suddenly
out
of
the
clear
darkness
the
sound
of
bells
as
an
endless
dream
it
went
on
the
spirit
of
the
past
brooding
over
a
new
generation
the
chosen
youth
from
the
muddled
unchastened
world
still
fed
romantically
on
the
mistakes
and
dreams
of
dead
statesmen
and
poets
here
was
a
new
generation
shouting
the
old
cries
learning
the
old
creeds
through
a
revery
of
long
days
and
nights
destined
finally
to
go
out
into
that
dirty
gray
turmoil
to
follow
love
and
pride
a
new
generation
dedicated
more
than
the
last
to
the
fear
of
poverty
and
the
worship
of
success
grown
up
to
find
all
gods
dead
all
wars
fought
all
faiths
in
man
shaken
amory
sorry
for
them
was
still
not
sorry
for
himself
art
politics
religion
whatever
his
medium
should
be
he
knew
he
was
safe
now
free
from
all
hysteria
he
could
accept
what
was
acceptable
roam
grow
rebel
sleep
deep
through
many
nights
there
was
no
god
in
his
heart
he
knew
his
ideas
were
still
in
riot
there
was
ever
the
pain
of
memory
the
regret
for
his
lost
youth
yet
the
waters
of
disillusion
had
left
a
deposit
on
his
soul
responsibility
and
a
love
of
life
the
faint
stirring
of
old
ambitions
and
unrealized
dreams
but
oh
rosalind
rosalind
it
all
a
poor
substitute
at
best
he
said
sadly
and
he
could
not
tell
why
the
struggle
was
worth
while
why
he
had
determined
to
use
to
the
utmost
himself
and
his
heritage
from
the
personalities
he
had
passed
he
stretched
out
his
arms
to
the
crystalline
radiant
sky
i
know
myself
he
cried
but
that

appendix
production
notes
for
ebook
edition
the
primary
feature
of
edition
is
restoration
of
which
are
missing
from
edition
my
favorite
instance
is
i
wo
belong
rather
than
i
wo
be
long
characters
which
are
in
the
printed
text
were
misrepresented
in
edition
edition
had
some
problems
a
handful
of
other
minor
errors
are
corrected
two
volumes
served
as
reference
for
edition
a
reprint
and
an
undated
reprint
produced
sometime
after
there
are
a
number
of
differences
between
the
volumes
evidence
suggests
that
the
reprint
has
been
somewhat
modernized
and
that
the
undated
reprint
is
a
better
match
for
the
original
printing
therefore
when
the
volumes
differ
edition
more
closely
follows
the
undated

in
edition
underscores
are
used
to

considered

decided
against

large

the
