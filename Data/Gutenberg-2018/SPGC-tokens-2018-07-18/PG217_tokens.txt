row
hell
row
was
a
block
of
thatched
bulging
cottages
that
stood
by
the
brookside
on
greenhill
lane
there
lived
the
colliers
who
worked
in
the
little
two
fields
away
the
brook
ran
under
the
alder
trees
scarcely
soiled
by
these
small
mines
whose
coal
was
drawn
to
the
surface
by
donkeys
that
plodded
wearily
in
a
circle
round
a
gin
and
all
over
the
countryside
were
these
same
pits
some
of
which
had
been
worked
in
the
time
of
charles
ii
the
few
colliers
and
the
donkeys
burrowing
down
like
ants
into
the
earth
making
queer
mounds
and
little
black
places
among
the
and
the
meadows
and
the
cottages
of
these
in
blocks
and
pairs
here
and
there
together
with
odd
farms
and
homes
of
the
stockingers
straying
over
the
parish
formed
the
village
of
bestwood
then
some
sixty
years
ago
a
sudden
change
took
place
were
elbowed
aside
by
the
large
mines
of
the
financiers
the
coal
and
iron
field
of
nottinghamshire
and
derbyshire
was
discovered
carston
waite
and
appeared
amid
tremendous
excitement
lord
palmerston
formally
opened
the
company
first
mine
at
spinney
park
on
the
edge
of
sherwood
forest
about
this
time
the
notorious
hell
row
which
through
growing
old
had
acquired
an
evil
reputation
was
burned
down
and
much
dirt
was
cleansed
away
carston
waite
found
they
had
struck
on
a
good
thing
so
down
the
valleys
of
the
brooks
from
selby
and
nuttall
new
mines
were
sunk
until
soon
there
were
six
pits
working
from
nuttall
high
up
on
the
sandstone
among
the
woods
the
railway
ran
past
the
ruined
priory
of
the
carthusians
and
past
robin
hood
well
down
to
spinney
park
then
on
to
minton
a
large
mine
among
from
minton
across
the
farmlands
of
the
valleyside
to
bunker
hill
branching
off
there
and
running
north
to
beggarlee
and
selby
that
looks
over
at
crich
and
the
hills
of
derbyshire
six
mines
like
black
studs
on
the
countryside
linked
by
a
loop
of
fine
chain
the
railway
to
accommodate
the
regiments
of
miners
carston
waite
and
built
the
squares
great
quadrangles
of
dwellings
on
the
hillside
of
bestwood
and
then
in
the
brook
valley
on
the
site
of
hell
row
they
erected
the
bottoms
the
bottoms
consisted
of
six
blocks
of
miners
dwellings
two
rows
of
three
like
the
dots
on
a
domino
and
twelve
houses
in
a
block
this
double
row
of
dwellings
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
rather
sharp
slope
from
bestwood
and
looked
out
from
the
attic
windows
at
least
on
the
slow
climb
of
the
valley
towards
selby
the
houses
themselves
were
substantial
and
very
decent
one
could
walk
all
round
seeing
little
front
gardens
with
auriculas
and
saxifrage
in
the
shadow
of
the
bottom
block
and
pinks
in
the
sunny
top
block
seeing
neat
front
windows
little
porches
little
privet
hedges
and
dormer
windows
for
the
attics
but
that
was
outside
that
was
the
view
on
to
the
uninhabited
parlours
of
all
the
colliers
wives
the
the
kitchen
was
at
the
back
of
the
house
facing
inward
between
the
blocks
looking
at
a
scrubby
back
garden
and
then
at
the
and
between
the
rows
between
the
long
lines
of
went
the
alley
where
the
children
played
and
the
women
gossiped
and
the
men
smoked
so
the
actual
conditions
of
living
in
the
bottoms
that
was
so
well
built
and
that
looked
so
nice
were
quite
unsavoury
because
people
must
live
in
the
kitchen
and
the
kitchens
opened
on
to
that
nasty
alley
of
morel
was
not
anxious
to
move
into
the
bottoms
which
was
already
twelve
years
old
and
on
the
downward
path
when
she
descended
to
it
from
bestwood
but
it
was
the
best
she
could
do
moreover
she
had
an
end
house
in
one
of
the
top
blocks
and
thus
had
only
one
neighbour
on
the
other
side
an
extra
strip
of
garden
and
having
an
end
house
she
enjoyed
a
kind
of
aristocracy
among
the
other
women
of
the
between
houses
because
her
rent
was
five
shillings
and
sixpence
instead
of
five
shillings
a
week
but
this
superiority
in
station
was
not
much
consolation
to
morel
she
was
years
old
and
had
been
married
eight
years
a
rather
small
woman
of
delicate
mould
but
resolute
bearing
she
shrank
a
little
from
the
first
contact
with
the
bottoms
women
she
came
down
in
the
july
and
in
the
september
expected
her
third
baby
her
husband
was
a
miner
they
had
only
been
in
their
new
home
three
weeks
when
the
wakes
or
fair
began
morel
she
knew
was
sure
to
make
a
holiday
of
it
he
went
off
early
on
the
monday
morning
the
day
of
the
fair
the
two
children
were
highly
excited
william
a
boy
of
seven
fled
off
immediately
after
breakfast
to
prowl
round
the
wakes
ground
leaving
annie
who
was
only
five
to
whine
all
morning
to
go
also
morel
did
her
work
she
scarcely
knew
her
neighbours
yet
and
knew
no
one
with
whom
to
trust
the
little
girl
so
she
promised
to
take
her
to
the
wakes
after
dinner
william
appeared
at
twelve
he
was
a
very
active
lad
freckled
with
a
touch
of
the
dane
or
norwegian
about
him
can

have
my
dinner
mother
he
cried
rushing
in
with
his
cap
on
it
begins
at
one
the
man
says

dinner
as
soon
as
it

replied
the
mother
is

he
cried
his
blue
eyes
staring
at
her
in
indignation
then
i
goin

nothing
of
the
sort
it
will
be
done
in
five
minutes
it
is
only
they
be
beginnin
the
boy
half
cried
half
shouted
you
wo
die
if
they

said
the
mother
besides
it
only
twelve
so
you
a
full
the
lad
began
hastily
to
lay
the
table
and
directly
the
three
sat
down
they
were
eating
and
jam
when
the
boy
jumped
off
his
chair
and
stood
perfectly
stiff
some
distance
away
could
be
heard
the
first
small
braying
of
a
and
the
tooting
of
a
horn
his
face
quivered
as
he
looked
at
his
mother
i
told
you
he
said
running
to
the
dresser
for
his
cap
take
your
pudding
in
your
hand
and
it
only
five
past
one
so
you
were
wrong
you
have
got
your
twopence
cried
the
mother
in
a
breath
the
boy
came
back
bitterly
disappointed
for
his
twopence
then
went
off
without
a
word
i
want
to
go
i
want
to
go
said
annie
beginning
to
cry
well
and
you
shall
go
whining
wizzening
little
stick
said
the
mother
and
later
in
the
afternoon
she
trudged
up
the
hill
under
the
tall
hedge
with
her
child
the
hay
was
gathered
from
the
fields
and
cattle
were
turned
on
to
the
eddish
it
was
warm
peaceful
morel
did
not
like
the
wakes
there
were
two
sets
of
horses
one
going
by
steam
one
pulled
round
by
a
pony
three
organs
were
grinding
and
there
came
odd
cracks
of
fearful
screeching
of
the
cocoanut
man
rattle
shouts
of
the
aunt
sally
man
screeches
from
the
lady
the
mother
perceived
her
son
gazing
enraptured
outside
the
lion
wallace
booth
at
the
pictures
of
this
famous
lion
that
had
killed
a
negro
and
maimed
for
life
two
white
men
she
left
him
alone
and
went
to
get
annie
a
spin
of
toffee
presently
the
lad
stood
in
front
of
her
wildly
excited

never
said

was
coming

the
a
lot
of
things
that
killed
three
men

he
was
tipful
of
excitement
now
she
had
come
led
her
about
the
ground
showed
her
everything
then
at
the
she
explained
the
pictures
in
a
sort
of
story
to
which
he
listened
as
if
spellbound
he
would
not
leave
her
all
the
time
he
stuck
close
to
her
bristling
with
a
small
boy
pride
of
her
for
no
other
woman
looked
such
a
lady
as
she
did
in
her
little
black
bonnet
and
her
cloak
she
smiled
when
she
saw
women
she
knew
when
she
was
tired
she
said
to
her
son
well
are
you
coming
now
or
later
are
you

he
cried
his
face
full
of
reproach
already
it
is
past
four
i
what
are
you
goin
for
he
lamented
you
need
come
if
you
do
want
she
said
and
she
went
slowly
away
with
her
little
girl
whilst
her
son
stood
watching
her
cut
to
the
heart
to
let
her
go
and
yet
unable
to
leave
the
wakes
as
she
crossed
the
open
ground
in
front
of
the
moon
and
stars
she
heard
men
shouting
and
smelled
the
beer
and
hurried
a
little
thinking
her
husband
was
probably
in
the
bar
at
about
six
her
son
came
home
tired
now
rather
pale
and
somewhat
wretched
he
was
miserable
though
he
did
not
know
it
because
he
had
let
her
go
alone
since
she
had
gone
he
had
not
enjoyed
his
wakes
has
my
dad
been
he
asked
no
said
the
mother
he
helping
to
wait
at
the
moon
and
stars
i
seed
him
through
that
black
tin
stuff
wi
holes
in
on
the
window
wi
his
sleeves
rolled
ha
exclaimed
the
mother
shortly
he
got
no
money
an
he
be
satisfied
if
he
gets
his
whether
they
give
him
more
or
when
the
light
was
fading
and
morel
could
see
no
more
to
sew
she
rose
and
went
to
the
door
everywhere
was
the
sound
of
excitement
the
restlessness
of
the
holiday
that
at
last
infected
her
she
went
out
into
the
side
garden
women
were
coming
home
from
the
wakes
the
children
hugging
a
white
lamb
with
green
legs
or
a
wooden
horse
occasionally
a
man
lurched
past
almost
as
full
as
he
could
carry
sometimes
a
good
husband
came
along
with
his
family
peacefully
but
usually
the
women
and
children
were
alone
the
mothers
stood
gossiping
at
the
corners
of
the
alley
as
the
twilight
sank
folding
their
arms
under
their
white
aprons
morel
was
alone
but
she
was
used
to
it
her
son
and
her
little
girl
slept
upstairs
so
it
seemed
her
home
was
there
behind
her
fixed
and
stable
but
she
felt
wretched
with
the
coming
child
the
world
seemed
a
dreary
place
where
nothing
else
would
happen
for
her
at
least
until
william
grew
up
but
for
herself
nothing
but
this
dreary
endurance
till
the
children
grew
up
and
the
children
she
could
not
afford
to
have
this
third
she
did
not
want
it
the
father
was
serving
beer
in
a
public
house
swilling
himself
drunk
she
despised
him
and
was
tied
to
him
this
coming
child
was
too
much
for
her
if
it
were
not
for
william
and
annie
she
was
sick
of
it
the
struggle
with
poverty
and
ugliness
and
meanness
she
went
into
the
front
garden
feeling
too
heavy
to
take
herself
out
yet
unable
to
stay
indoors
the
heat
suffocated
her
and
looking
ahead
the
prospect
of
her
life
made
her
feel
as
if
she
were
buried
alive
the
front
garden
was
a
small
square
with
a
privet
hedge
there
she
stood
trying
to
soothe
herself
with
the
scent
of
flowers
and
the
fading
beautiful
evening
opposite
her
small
gate
was
the
stile
that
led
uphill
under
the
tall
hedge
between
the
burning
glow
of
the
cut
pastures
the
sky
overhead
throbbed
and
pulsed
with
light
the
glow
sank
quickly
off
the
field
the
earth
and
the
hedges
smoked
dusk
as
it
grew
dark
a
ruddy
glare
came
out
on
the
hilltop
and
out
of
the
glare
the
diminished
commotion
of
the
fair
sometimes
down
the
trough
of
darkness
formed
by
the
path
under
the
hedges
men
came
lurching
home
one
young
man
lapsed
into
a
run
down
the
steep
bit
that
ended
the
hill
and
went
with
a
crash
into
the
stile
morel
shuddered
he
picked
himself
up
swearing
viciously
rather
pathetically
as
if
he
thought
the
stile
had
wanted
to
hurt
him
she
went
indoors
wondering
if
things
were
never
going
to
alter
she
was
beginning
by
now
to
realise
that
they
would
not
she
seemed
so
far
away
from
her
girlhood
she
wondered
if
it
were
the
same
person
walking
heavily
up
the
back
garden
at
the
bottoms
as
had
run
so
lightly
up
the
breakwater
at
sheerness
ten
years
before
what
have
i
to
do
with
it
she
said
to
herself
what
have
i
to
do
with
all
this
even
the
child
i
am
going
to
have
it
does
seem
as
if
i
were
taken
into
sometimes
life
takes
hold
of
one
carries
the
body
along
accomplishes
one
history
and
yet
is
not
real
but
leaves
oneself
as
it
were
slurred
over
i
wait
morel
said
to
herself
i
wait
and
what
i
wait
for
can
never
then
she
straightened
the
kitchen
lit
the
lamp
mended
the
fire
looked
out
the
washing
for
the
next
day
and
put
it
to
soak
after
which
she
sat
down
to
her
sewing
through
the
long
hours
her
needle
flashed
regularly
through
the
stuff
occasionally
she
sighed
moving
to
relieve
herself
and
all
the
time
she
was
thinking
how
to
make
the
most
of
what
she
had
for
the
children
sakes
at
eleven
her
husband
came
his
cheeks
were
very
red
and
very
shiny
above
his
black
moustache
his
head
nodded
slightly
he
was
pleased
with
himself

many
were
ruined
in
nottingham
her
father
george
coppard
was
an
engineer
a
large
handsome
haughty
man
proud
of
his
fair
skin
and
blue
eyes
but
more
proud
still
of
his
integrity
gertrude
resembled
her
mother
in
her
small
build
but
her
temper
proud
and
unyielding
she
had
from
the
coppards
george
coppard
was
bitterly
galled
by
his
own
poverty
he
became
foreman
of
the
engineers
in
the
dockyard
at
sheerness
morel
gertrude
was
the
second
daughter
she
favoured
her
mother
loved
her
mother
best
of
all
but
she
had
the
coppards
clear
defiant
blue
eyes
and
their
broad
brow
she
remembered
to
have
hated
her
father
overbearing
manner
towards
her
gentle
humorous
mother
she
remembered
running
over
the
breakwater
at
sheerness
and
finding
the
boat
she
remembered
to
have
been
petted
and
flattered
by
all
the
men
when
she
had
gone
to
the
dockyard
for
she
was
a
delicate
rather
proud
child
she
remembered
the
funny
old
mistress
whose
assistant
she
had
become
whom
she
had
loved
to
help
in
the
private
school
and
she
still
had
the
bible
that
john
field
had
given
her
she
used
to
walk
home
from
chapel
with
john
field
when
she
was
nineteen
he
was
the
son
of
a
tradesman
had
been
to
college
in
london
and
was
to
devote
himself
to
business
she
could
always
recall
in
detail
a
september
sunday
afternoon
when
they
had
sat
under
the
vine
at
the
back
of
her
father
house
the
sun
came
through
the
chinks
of
the
and
made
beautiful
patterns
like
a
lace
scarf
falling
on
her
and
on
him
some
of
the
leaves
were
clean
yellow
like
yellow
flat
flowers
now
sit
still
he
had
cried
now
your
hair
i
do
know
what
it
is
like
it
as
bright
as
copper
and
gold
as
red
as
burnt
copper
and
it
has
gold
threads
where
the
sun
shines
on
it
fancy
their
saying
brown
your
mother
calls
it
she
had
met
his
brilliant
eyes
but
her
clear
face
scarcely
showed
the
elation
which
rose
within
her
but
you
say
you
do
like
business
she
pursued
i
do
i
hate
it
he
cried
hotly
and
you
would
like
to
go
into
the
ministry
she
half
implored
i
should
i
should
love
it
if
i
thought
i
could
make
a
then
why
do
you
why
do
you
her
voice
rang
with
defiance
if
i
were
a
man
nothing
would
stop
she
held
her
head
erect
he
was
rather
timid
before
her
but
my
father
so
he
means
to
put
me
into
the
business
and
i
know
he
do
but
if
you
a
man
she
had
cried
being
a
man
is
everything
he
replied
frowning
with
puzzled
helplessness
now
as
she
moved
about
her
work
at
the
bottoms
with
some
experience
of
what
being
a
man
meant
she
knew
that
it
was
not
everything
at
twenty
owing
to
her
health
she
had
left
sheerness
her
father
had
retired
home
to
nottingham
john
field
father
had
been
ruined
the
son
had
gone
as
a
teacher
in
norwood
she
did
not
hear
of
him
until
two
years
later
she
made
determined
inquiry
he
had
married
his
landlady
a
woman
of
forty
a
widow
with
property
and
still
morel
preserved
john
field
bible
she
did
not
now
believe
him
to
be
well
she
understood
pretty
well
what
he
might
or
might
not
have
been
so
she
preserved
his
bible
and
kept
his
memory
intact
in
her
heart
for
her
own
sake
to
her
dying
day
for
years
she
did
not
speak
of
him
when
she
was
years
old
she
met
at
a
christmas
party
a
young
man
from
the
erewash
valley
morel
was
then
years
old
he
was
well
erect
and
very
smart
he
had
wavy
black
hair
that
shone
again
and
a
vigorous
black
beard
that
had
never
been
shaved
his
cheeks
were
ruddy
and
his
red
moist
mouth
was
noticeable
because
he
laughed
so
often
and
so
heartily
he
had
that
rare
thing
a
rich
ringing
laugh
gertrude
coppard
had
watched
him
fascinated
he
was
so
full
of
colour
and
animation
his
voice
ran
so
easily
into
comic
grotesque
he
was
so
ready
and
so
pleasant
with
everybody
her
own
father
had
a
rich
fund
of
humour
but
it
was
satiric
this
man
was
different
soft
warm
a
kind
of
gambolling
she
herself
was
opposite
she
had
a
curious
receptive
mind
which
found
much
pleasure
and
amusement
in
listening
to
other
folk
she
was
clever
in
leading
folk
to
talk
she
loved
ideas
and
was
considered
very
intellectual
what
she
liked
most
of
all
was
an
argument
on
religion
or
philosophy
or
politics
with
some
educated
man
this
she
did
not
often
enjoy
so
she
always
had
people
tell
her
about
themselves
finding
her
pleasure
so
in
her
person
she
was
rather
small
and
delicate
with
a
large
brow
and
dropping
bunches
of
brown
silk
curls
her
blue
eyes
were
very
straight
honest
and
searching
she
had
the
beautiful
hands
of
the
coppards
her
dress
was
always
subdued
she
wore
dark
blue
silk
with
a
peculiar
silver
chain
of
silver
scallops
this
and
a
heavy
brooch
of
twisted
gold
was
her
only
ornament
she
was
still
perfectly
intact
deeply
religious
and
full
of
beautiful
candour
walter
morel
seemed
melted
away
before
her
she
was
to
the
miner
that
thing
of
mystery
and
fascination
a
lady
when
she
spoke
to
him
it
was
with
a
southern
pronunciation
and
a
purity
of
english
which
thrilled
him
to
hear
she
watched
him
he
danced
well
as
if
it
were
natural
and
joyous
in
him
to
dance
his
grandfather
was
a
french
refugee
who
had
married
an
english
barmaid
if
it
had
been
a
marriage
gertrude
coppard
watched
the
young
miner
as
he
danced
a
certain
subtle
exultation
like
glamour
in
his
movement
and
his
face
the
flower
of
his
body
ruddy
with
tumbled
black
hair
and
laughing
alike
whatever
partner
he
bowed
above
she
thought
him
rather
wonderful
never
having
met
anyone
like
him
her
father
was
to
her
the
type
of
all
men
and
george
coppard
proud
in
his
bearing
handsome
and
rather
bitter
who
preferred
theology
in
reading
and
who
drew
near
in
sympathy
only
to
one
man
the
apostle
paul
who
was
harsh
in
government
and
in
familiarity
ironic
who
ignored
all
sensuous
pleasure
he
was
very
different
from
the
miner
gertrude
herself
was
rather
contemptuous
of
dancing
she
had
not
the
slightest
inclination
towards
that
accomplishment
and
had
never
learned
even
a
roger
de
coverley
she
was
puritan
like
her
father
and
really
stern
therefore
the
dusky
golden
softness
of
this
man
sensuous
flame
of
life
that
flowed
off
his
flesh
like
the
flame
from
a
candle
not
baffled
and
gripped
into
incandescence
by
thought
and
spirit
as
her
life
was
seemed
to
her
something
wonderful
beyond
her
he
came
and
bowed
above
her
a
warmth
radiated
through
her
as
if
she
had
drunk
wine
now
do
come
and
have
this
one
wi
me
he
said
caressively
it
easy
you
know
i
pining
to
see
you
she
had
told
him
before
she
could
not
dance
she
glanced
at
his
humility
and
smiled
her
smile
was
very
beautiful
it
moved
the
man
so
that
he
forgot
everything
no
i
wo
dance
she
said
softly
her
words
came
clean
and
ringing
not
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
often
did
the
right
thing
by
instinct
he
sat
beside
her
inclining
reverentially
but
you
must
miss
your
dance
she
reproved
nay
i
do
want
to
dance
that
it
not
one
as
i
care
yet
you
invited
me
to
he
laughed
very
heartily
at
this
i
never
thought
o
that
not
long
in
taking
the
curl
out
of
it
was
her
turn
to
laugh
quickly
you
do
look
as
if
you
come
much
uncurled
she
said
i
like
a
pig
tail
i
curl
because
i
canna
help
it
he
laughed
rather
boisterously
and
you
are
a
miner
she
exclaimed
in
surprise
yes
i
went
down
when
i
was
she
looked
at
him
in
wondering
dismay
when
you
were
ten
and
was
it
very
hard
she
asked
you
soon
get
used
to
it
you
live
like
th
mice
an
you
pop
out
at
night
to
see
what
going
it
makes
me
feel
blind
she
frowned
like
a
moudiwarp
he
laughed
yi
an
there
some
chaps
as
does
go
round
like
he
thrust
his
face
forward
in
the
blind
way
of
a
mole
seeming
to
sniff
and
peer
for
direction
they
dun
though
he
protested
naively
tha
niver
seed
such
a
way
they
get
in
but
tha
mun
let
me
thee
down
some
time
an
tha
can
see
for
she
looked
at
him
startled
this
was
a
new
tract
of
life
suddenly
opened
before
her
she
realised
the
life
of
the
miners
hundreds
of
them
toiling
below
earth
and
coming
up
at
evening
he
seemed
to
her
noble
he
risked
his
life
daily
and
with
gaiety
she
looked
at
him
with
a
touch
of
appeal
in
her
pure
humility
should
ter
like
it
he
asked
tenderly
not
it
dirty
she
had
never
been
thee
and
thou
before
the
next
christmas
they
were
married
and
for
three
months
she
was
perfectly
happy
for
six
months
she
was
very
happy
he
had
signed
the
pledge
and
wore
the
blue
ribbon
of
a
he
was
nothing
if
not
showy
they
lived
she
thought
in
his
own
house
it
was
small
but
convenient
enough
and
quite
nicely
furnished
with
solid
worthy
stuff
that
suited
her
honest
soul
the
women
her
neighbours
were
rather
foreign
to
her
and
morel
mother
and
sisters
were
apt
to
sneer
at
her
ladylike
ways
but
she
could
perfectly
well
live
by
herself
so
long
as
she
had
her
husband
close
sometimes
when
she
herself
wearied
of
she
tried
to
open
her
heart
seriously
to
him
she
saw
him
listen
deferentially
but
without
understanding
this
killed
her
efforts
at
a
finer
intimacy
and
she
had
flashes
of
fear
sometimes
he
was
restless
of
an
evening
it
was
not
enough
for
him
just
to
be
near
her
she
realised
she
was
glad
when
he
set
himself
to
little
jobs
he
was
a
remarkably
handy
man
could
make
or
mend
anything
so
she
would
say
i
do
like
that
of
your
mother
it
is
small
and
does
ter
my
wench
well
i
made
that
so
i
can
make
thee
one
what
why
it
a
steel
one
an
what
if
it
is
tha
one
very
similar
if
not
exactly
she
did
not
mind
the
mess
nor
the
hammering
and
noise
he
was
busy
and
happy
but
in
the
seventh
month
when
she
was
brushing
his
sunday
coat
she
felt
papers
in
the
breast
pocket
and
seized
with
a
sudden
curiosity
took
them
out
to
read
he
very
rarely
wore
the
he
was
married
in
and
it
had
not
occurred
to
her
before
to
feel
curious
concerning
the
papers
they
were
the
bills
of
the
household
furniture
still
unpaid
look
here
she
said
at
night
after
he
was
washed
and
had
had
his
dinner
i
found
these
in
the
pocket
of
your
have
you
settled
the
bills
yet
no
i
have
had
a
but
you
told
me
all
was
paid
i
had
better
go
into
nottingham
on
saturday
and
settle
them
i
do
like
sitting
on
another
man
chairs
and
eating
from
an
unpaid
he
did
not
answer
i
can
have
your
ca
i
tha
can
it
for
what
good
it
be
to
i
thought
she
began
he
had
told
her
he
had
a
good
bit
of
money
left
over
but
she
realised
it
was
no
use
asking
questions
she
sat
rigid
with
bitterness
and
indignation
the
next
day
she
went
down
to
see
his
mother
did
you
buy
the
furniture
for
walter
she
asked
yes
i
did
tartly
retorted
the
elder
woman
and
how
much
did
he
give
you
to
pay
for
it
the
elder
woman
was
stung
with
fine
indignation
eighty
pound
if
you
so
keen
on
knowin
she
replied
eighty
pounds
but
there
are
pounds
still
owing
i
ca
help
but
where
has
it
all
gone
you
find
all
the
papers
i
think
if
you
look
beside
ten
pound
as
he
owed
me
an
six
pound
as
the
wedding
cost
down
six
pounds
echoed
gertrude
morel
it
seemed
to
her
monstrous
that
after
her
own
father
had
paid
so
heavily
for
her
wedding
six
pounds
more
should
have
been
squandered
in
eating
and
drinking
at
parents
house
at
his
expense
and
how
much
has
he
sunk
in
his
houses
she
asked
his
houses
which
houses
gertrude
morel
went
white
to
the
lips
he
had
told
her
the
house
he
lived
in
and
the
next
one
was
his
own
i
thought
the
house
we
live
in
she
began
they
my
houses
those
two
said
the
and
not
clear
either
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
keep
the
mortgage
interest
gertrude
sat
white
and
silent
she
was
her
father
now
then
we
ought
to
be
paying
you
rent
she
said
coldly
walter
is
paying
me
rent
replied
the
mother
and
what
rent
asked
gertrude
six
and
six
a
week
retorted
the
mother
it
was
more
than
the
house
was
worth
gertrude
held
her
head
erect
looked
straight
before
her
it
is
lucky
to
be
you
said
the
elder
woman
bitingly
to
have
a
husband
as
takes
all
the
worry
of
the
money
and
leaves
you
a
free
the
young
wife
was
silent
she
said
very
little
to
her
husband
but
her
manner
had
changed
towards
him
something
in
her
proud
honourable
soul
had
crystallised
out
hard
as
rock
when
october
came
in
she
thought
only
of
christmas
two
years
ago
at
christmas
she
had
met
him
last
christmas
she
had
married
him
this
christmas
she
would
bear
him
a
child
you
do
dance
yourself
do
you
missis
asked
her
nearest
neighbour
in
october
when
there
was
great
talk
of
opening
a
over
the
brick
and
tile
inn
at
bestwood
no
i
never
had
the
least
inclination
to
morel
replied
fancy
an
how
funny
as
you
should
ha
married
your
mester
you
know
he
quite
a
famous
one
for
i
did
know
he
was
famous
laughed
morel
yea
he
is
though
why
he
ran
that
in
the
miners
arms
for
over
five
did
he
yes
he
the
other
woman
was
defiant
an
it
was
thronged
every
tuesday
and
thursday
an
an
there
was
accordin
to
all
this
kind
of
thing
was
gall
and
bitterness
to
morel
and
she
had
a
fair
share
of
it
the
women
did
not
spare
her
at
first
for
she
was
superior
though
she
could
not
help
it
he
began
to
be
rather
late
in
coming
home
they
working
very
late
now
are
they
she
said
to
her
no
later
than
they
allers
do
i
do
think
but
they
stop
to
have
their
pint
at
ellen
an
they
get
talkin
an
there
you
are
dinner
stone
cold
an
it
serves
but
morel
does
not
take
any
the
woman
dropped
the
clothes
looked
at
morel
then
went
on
with
her
work
saying
nothing
gertrude
morel
was
very
ill
when
the
boy
was
born
morel
was
good
to
her
as
good
as
gold
but
she
felt
very
lonely
miles
away
from
her
own
people
she
felt
lonely
with
him
now
and
his
presence
only
made
it
more
intense
the
boy
was
small
and
frail
at
first
but
he
came
on
quickly
he
was
a
beautiful
child
with
dark
gold
ringlets
and
eyes
which
changed
gradually
to
a
clear
grey
his
mother
loved
him
passionately
he
came
just
when
her
own
bitterness
of
disillusion
was
hardest
to
bear
when
her
faith
in
life
was
shaken
and
her
soul
felt
dreary
and
lonely
she
made
much
of
the
child
and
the
father
was
jealous
at
last
morel
despised
her
husband
she
turned
to
the
child
she
turned
from
the
father
he
had
begun
to
neglect
her
the
novelty
of
his
own
home
was
gone
he
had
no
grit
she
said
bitterly
to
herself
what
he
felt
just
at
the
minute
that
was
all
to
him
he
could
not
abide
by
anything
there
was
nothing
at
the
back
of
all
his
show
there
began
a
battle
between
the
husband
and
wife
a
fearful
bloody
battle
that
ended
only
with
the
death
of
one
she
fought
to
make
him
undertake
his
own
responsibilities
to
make
him
fulfill
his
obligations
but
he
was
too
different
from
her
his
nature
was
purely
sensuous
and
she
strove
to
make
him
moral
religious
she
tried
to
force
him
to
face
things
he
could
not
endure
it
it
drove
him
out
of
his
mind
while
the
baby
was
still
tiny
the
father
temper
had
become
so
irritable
that
it
was
not
to
be
trusted
the
child
had
only
to
give
a
little
trouble
when
the
man
began
to
bully
a
little
more
and
the
hard
hands
of
the
collier
hit
the
baby
then
morel
loathed
her
husband
loathed
him
for
days
and
he
went
out
and
drank
and
she
cared
very
little
what
he
did
only
on
his
return
she
scathed
him
with
her
satire
the
estrangement
between
them
caused
him
knowingly
or
unknowingly
grossly
to
offend
her
where
he
would
not
have
done
william
was
only
one
year
old
and
his
mother
was
proud
of
him
he
was
so
pretty
she
was
not
well
off
now
but
her
sisters
kept
the
boy
in
clothes
then
with
his
little
white
hat
curled
with
an
ostrich
feather
and
his
white
coat
he
was
a
joy
to
her
the
twining
wisps
of
hair
clustering
round
his
head
morel
lay
listening
one
sunday
morning
to
the
chatter
of
the
father
and
child
downstairs
then
she
dozed
off
when
she
came
downstairs
a
great
fire
glowed
in
the
grate
the
room
was
hot
the
breakfast
was
roughly
laid
and
seated
in
his
armchair
against
the
sat
morel
rather
timid
and
standing
between
his
legs
the
child
cropped
like
a
sheep
with
such
an
odd
round
poll
looking
wondering
at
her
and
on
a
newspaper
spread
out
upon
the
hearthrug
a
myriad
of
curls
like
the
petals
of
a
marigold
scattered
in
the
reddening
firelight
morel
stood
still
it
was
her
first
baby
she
went
very
white
and
was
unable
to
speak
what
dost
think
o
morel
laughed
uneasily
she
gripped
her
two
fists
lifted
them
and
came
forward
morel
shrank
back
i
could
kill
you
i
could
she
said
she
choked
with
rage
her
two
fists
uplifted
yer
non
want
ter
make
a
wench
on
morel
said
in
a
frightened
tone
bending
his
head
to
shield
his
eyes
from
hers
his
attempt
at
laughter
had
vanished
the
mother
looked
down
at
the
jagged
head
of
her
child
she
put
her
hands
on
his
hair
and
stroked
and
fondled
his
head
oh
my
boy
she
faltered
her
lip
trembled
her
face
broke
and
snatching
up
the
child
she
buried
her
face
in
his
shoulder
and
cried
painfully
she
was
one
of
those
women
who
can
not
cry
whom
it
hurts
as
it
hurts
a
man
it
was
like
ripping
something
out
of
her
her
sobbing
morel
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
his
hands
gripped
together
till
the
knuckles
were
white
he
gazed
in
the
fire
feeling
almost
stunned
as
if
he
could
not
breathe
presently
she
came
to
an
end
soothed
the
child
and
cleared
away
the
she
left
the
newspaper
littered
with
curls
spread
upon
the
hearthrug
at
last
her
husband
gathered
it
up
and
put
it
at
the
back
of
the
fire
she
went
about
her
work
with
closed
mouth
and
very
quiet
morel
was
subdued
he
crept
about
wretchedly
and
his
meals
were
a
misery
that
day
she
spoke
to
him
civilly
and
never
alluded
to
what
he
had
done
but
he
felt
something
final
had
happened
afterwards
she
said
she
had
been
silly
that
the
boy
hair
would
have
had
to
be
cut
sooner
or
later
in
the
end
she
even
brought
herself
to
say
to
her
husband
it
was
just
as
well
he
had
played
barber
when
he
did
but
she
knew
and
morel
knew
that
that
act
had
caused
something
momentous
to
take
place
in
her
soul
she
remembered
the
scene
all
her
life
as
one
in
which
she
had
suffered
the
most
intensely
this
act
of
masculine
clumsiness
was
the
spear
through
the
side
of
her
love
for
morel
before
while
she
had
striven
against
him
bitterly
she
had
fretted
after
him
as
if
he
had
gone
astray
from
her
now
she
ceased
to
fret
for
his
love
he
was
an
outsider
to
her
this
made
life
much
more
bearable
nevertheless
she
still
continued
to
strive
with
him
she
still
had
her
high
moral
sense
inherited
from
generations
of
puritans
it
was
now
a
religious
instinct
and
she
was
almost
a
fanatic
with
him
because
she
loved
him
or
had
loved
him
if
he
sinned
she
tortured
him
if
he
drank
and
lied
was
often
a
poltroon
sometimes
a
knave
she
wielded
the
lash
unmercifully
the
pity
was
she
was
too
much
his
opposite
she
could
not
be
content
with
the
little
he
might
be
she
would
have
him
the
much
that
he
ought
to
be
so
in
seeking
to
make
him
nobler
than
he
could
be
she
destroyed
him
she
injured
and
hurt
and
scarred
herself
but
she
lost
none
of
her
worth
she
also
had
the
children
he
drank
rather
heavily
though
not
more
than
many
miners
and
always
beer
so
that
whilst
his
health
was
affected
it
was
never
injured
the
was
his
chief
carouse
he
sat
in
the
miners
arms
until
time
every
friday
every
saturday
and
every
sunday
evening
on
monday
and
tuesday
he
had
to
get
up
and
reluctantly
leave
towards
ten
sometimes
he
stayed
at
home
on
wednesday
and
thursday
evenings
or
was
only
out
for
an
hour
he
practically
never
had
to
miss
work
owing
to
his
drinking
but
although
he
was
very
steady
at
work
his
wages
fell
off
he
was
a
authority
was
hateful
to
him
therefore
he
could
only
abuse
the
he
would
say
in
the
palmerston
th
gaffer
come
down
to
our
stall
this
morning
an
says
know
walter
this
not
do
what
about
these
props
an
i
says
to

what
art
talkin
about
what

about
th
props
never

then

hold

up
wi
thy
so
wor
that
mad
cossed
an
swore
an
chaps
they
did
morel
was
a
good
mimic
he
imitated
the
manager
fat
squeaky
voice
with
its
attempt
at
good
english
sha
have
it
walter
who
knows
more
about
it
me
or
you
so
i
says
niver
fun
out
how
much
tha
knows
alfred
it
carry
thee
ter
bed
an
so
morel
would
go
on
to
the
amusement
of
his
boon
companions
and
some
of
this
would
be
true
the
was
not
an
educated
man
he
had
been
a
boy
along
with
morel
so
that
while
the
two
disliked
each
other
they
more
or
less
took
each
other
for
granted
but
alfred
charlesworth
did
not
forgive
the
butty
these
sayings
consequently
although
morel
was
a
good
miner
sometimes
earning
as
much
as
five
pounds
a
week
when
he
married
he
came
gradually
to
have
worse
and
worse
stalls
where
the
coal
was
thin
and
hard
to
get
and
unprofitable
also
in
summer
the
pits
are
slack
often
on
bright
sunny
mornings
the
men
are
seen
trooping
home
again
at
ten
eleven
or
twelve
no
empty
trucks
stand
at
the
the
women
on
the
hillside
look
across
as
they
shake
the
hearthrug
against
the
fence
and
count
the
wagons
the
engine
is
taking
along
the
line
up
the
valley
and
the
children
as
they
come
from
school
at
looking
down
the
fields
and
seeing
the
wheels
on
the
headstocks
standing
say
minton
knocked
off
my
dad
be
at
and
there
is
a
sort
of
shadow
over
all
women
and
children
and
men
because
money
will
be
short
at
the
end
of
the
week
morel
was
supposed
to
give
his
wife
thirty
shillings
a
week
to
provide
everything
rent
food
clothes
clubs
insurance
doctors
occasionally
if
he
were
flush
he
gave
her
but
these
occasions
by
no
means
balanced
those
when
he
gave
her
in
winter
with
a
decent
stall
the
miner
might
earn
fifty
or
shillings
a
week
then
he
was
happy
on
friday
night
saturday
and
sunday
he
spent
royally
getting
rid
of
his
sovereign
or
thereabouts
and
out
of
so
much
he
scarcely
spared
the
children
an
extra
penny
or
bought
them
a
pound
of
apples
it
all
went
in
drink
in
the
bad
times
matters
were
more
worrying
but
he
was
not
so
often
drunk
so
that
morel
used
to
say
i
not
sure
i
would
rather
be
short
for
when
he
flush
there
is
a
minute
of
if
he
earned
forty
shillings
he
kept
ten
from
he
kept
five
from
he
kept
four
from
he
kept
three
from
he
kept
two
from
twenty
he
kept
from
eighteen
he
kept
a
shilling
from
sixteen
he
kept
sixpence
he
never
saved
a
penny
and
he
gave
his
wife
no
opportunity
of
saving
instead
she
had
occasionally
to
pay
his
debts
not
debts
for
those
never
were
passed
on
to
the
women
but
debts
when
he
had
bought
a
canary
or
a
fancy
at
the
wakes
time
morel
was
working
badly
and
morel
was
trying
to
save
against
her
confinement
so
it
galled
her
bitterly
to
think
he
should
be
out
taking
his
pleasure
and
spending
money
whilst
she
remained
at
home
harassed
there
were
two
days
holiday
on
the
tuesday
morning
morel
rose
early
he
was
in
good
spirits
quite
early
before
six
she
heard
him
whistling
away
to
himself
downstairs
he
had
a
pleasant
way
of
whistling
lively
and
musical
he
nearly
always
whistled
hymns
he
had
been
a
with
a
beautiful
voice
and
had
taken
solos
in
southwell
cathedral
his
morning
whistling
alone
betrayed
it
his
wife
lay
listening
to
him
tinkering
away
in
the
garden
his
whistling
ringing
out
as
he
sawed
and
hammered
away
it
always
gave
her
a
sense
of
warmth
and
peace
to
hear
him
thus
as
she
lay
in
bed
the
children
not
yet
awake
in
the
bright
early
morning
happy
in
his
fashion
at
nine
while
the
children
with
bare
legs
and
feet
were
sitting
playing
on
the
sofa
and
the
mother
was
washing
up
he
came
in
from
his
carpentry
his
sleeves
rolled
up
his
waistcoat
hanging
open
he
was
still
a
man
with
black
wavy
hair
and
a
large
black
moustache
his
face
was
perhaps
too
much
inflamed
and
there
was
about
him
a
look
almost
of
peevishness
but
now
he
was
jolly
he
went
straight
to
the
sink
where
his
wife
was
washing
up
what
are
thee
there
he
said
boisterously
sluthe
off
an
let
me
wesh
you
may
wait
till
i
finished
said
his
wife
oh
mun
i
an
what
if
i
shonna
this
threat
amused
morel
then
you
can
go
and
wash
yourself
in
the
ha
i
can
an
a
tha
mucky
little
with
which
he
stood
watching
her
a
moment
then
went
away
to
wait
for
her
when
he
chose
he
could
still
make
himself
again
a
real
gallant
usually
he
preferred
to
go
out
with
a
scarf
round
his
neck
now
however
he
made
a
toilet
there
seemed
so
much
gusto
in
the
way
he
puffed
and
swilled
as
he
washed
himself
so
much
alacrity
with
which
he
hurried
to
the
mirror
in
the
kitchen
and
bending
because
it
was
too
low
for
him
scrupulously
parted
his
wet
black
hair
that
it
irritated
morel
he
put
on
a
collar
a
black
bow
and
wore
his
sunday
as
such
he
looked
spruce
and
what
his
clothes
would
not
do
his
instinct
for
making
the
most
of
his
good
looks
would
at
nine
jerry
purdy
came
to
call
for
his
pal
jerry
was
morel
bosom
friend
and
morel
disliked
him
he
was
a
tall
thin
man
with
a
rather
foxy
face
the
kind
of
face
that
seems
to
lack
eyelashes
he
walked
with
a
stiff
brittle
dignity
as
if
his
head
were
on
a
wooden
spring
his
nature
was
cold
and
shrewd
generous
where
he
intended
to
be
generous
he
seemed
to
be
very
fond
of
morel
and
more
or
less
to
take
charge
of
him
morel
hated
him
she
had
known
his
wife
who
had
died
of
consumption
and
who
had
at
the
end
conceived
such
a
violent
dislike
of
her
husband
that
if
he
came
into
her
room
it
caused
her
haemorrhage
none
of
which
jerry
had
seemed
to
mind
and
now
his
eldest
daughter
a
girl
of
fifteen
kept
a
poor
house
for
him
and
looked
after
the
two
younger
children
a
mean
stick
morel
said
of
him
i
never
known
jerry
mean
in
my
life
protested
morel
a
and
more
freer
chap
you
could
find
anywhere
to
my
to
you
retorted
morel
but
his
fist
is
shut
tight
enough
to
his
children
poor
poor
things
and
what
for
are
they
poor
things
i
should
like
to
but
morel
would
not
be
appeased
on
jerry
score
the
subject
of
argument
was
seen
craning
his
thin
neck
over
the
scullery
curtain
he
caught
morel
eye
mornin
missis
mester
in
yes
he
jerry
entered
unasked
and
stood
by
the
kitchen
doorway
he
was
not
invited
to
sit
down
but
stood
there
coolly
asserting
the
rights
of
men
and
husbands
a
nice
day
he
said
to
morel
yes
grand
out
this
morning
grand
for
a
do
you
mean
you
going
for
a
walk
she
asked
yes
we
mean
walkin
to
nottingham
he
replied
h
the
two
men
greeted
each
other
both
glad
jerry
however
full
of
assurance
morel
rather
subdued
afraid
to
seem
too
jubilant
in
presence
of
his
wife
but
he
laced
his
boots
quickly
with
spirit
they
were
going
for
a
walk
across
the
fields
to
nottingham
climbing
the
hillside
from
the
bottoms
they
mounted
gaily
into
the
morning
at
the
moon
and
stars
they
had
their
first
drink
then
on
to
the
old
spot
then
a
long
five
miles
of
drought
to
carry
them
into
bulwell
to
a
glorious
pint
of
bitter
but
they
stayed
in
a
field
with
some
haymakers
whose
gallon
bottle
was
full
so
that
when
they
came
in
sight
of
the
city
morel
was
sleepy
the
town
spread
upwards
before
them
smoking
vaguely
in
the
midday
glare
fridging
the
crest
away
to
the
south
with
spires
and
factory
bulks
and
chimneys
in
the
last
field
morel
lay
down
under
an
oak
tree
and
slept
soundly
for
over
an
hour
when
he
rose
to
go
forward
he
felt
queer
the
two
had
dinner
in
the
meadows
with
jerry
sister
then
repaired
to
the
punch
bowl
where
they
mixed
in
the
excitement
of
morel
never
in
his
life
played
cards
considering
them
as
having
some
occult
malevolent
power
the
devil
pictures
he
called
them
but
he
was
a
master
of
skittles
and
of
dominoes
he
took
a
challenge
from
a
newark
man
on
skittles
all
the
men
in
the
old
long
bar
took
sides
betting
either
one
way
or
the
other
morel
took
off
his
coat
jerry
held
the
hat
containing
the
money
the
men
at
the
tables
watched
some
stood
with
their
mugs
in
their
hands
morel
felt
his
big
wooden
ball
carefully
then
launched
it
he
played
havoc
among
the
and
won
half
a
crown
which
restored
him
to
solvency
by
seven
the
two
were
in
good
condition
they
caught
the
train
home
in
the
afternoon
the
bottoms
was
intolerable
every
inhabitant
remaining
was
out
of
doors
the
women
in
twos
and
threes
bareheaded
and
in
white
aprons
gossiped
in
the
alley
between
the
blocks
men
having
a
rest
between
drinks
sat
on
their
heels
and
talked
the
place
smelled
stale
the
slate
roofs
glistered
in
the
arid
heat
morel
took
the
little
girl
down
to
the
brook
in
the
meadows
which
were
not
more
than
two
hundred
yards
away
the
water
ran
quickly
over
stones
and
broken
pots
mother
and
child
leaned
on
the
rail
of
the
old
watching
up
at
the
at
the
other
end
of
the
meadow
morel
could
see
the
naked
forms
of
boys
flashing
round
the
deep
yellow
water
or
an
occasional
bright
figure
dart
glittering
over
the
blackish
stagnant
meadow
she
knew
william
was
at
the
and
it
was
the
dread
of
her
life
lest
he
should
get
drowned
annie
played
under
the
tall
old
hedge
picking
up
alder
cones
that
she
called
currants
the
child
required
much
attention
and
the
flies
were
teasing
the
children
were
put
to
bed
at
seven
then
she
worked
awhile
when
walter
morel
and
jerry
arrived
at
bestwood
they
felt
a
load
off
their
minds
a
railway
journey
no
longer
impended
so
they
could
put
the
finishing
touches
to
a
glorious
day
they
entered
the
nelson
with
the
satisfaction
of
returned
travellers
the
next
day
was
a
and
the
thought
of
it
put
a
damper
on
the
men
spirits
most
of
them
moreover
had
spent
their
money
some
were
already
rolling
dismally
home
to
sleep
in
preparation
for
the
morrow
morel
listening
to
their
mournful
singing
went
indoors
nine
passed
and
ten
and
still
the
pair
had
not
returned
on
a
doorstep
somewhere
a
man
was
singing
loudly
in
a
drawl
lead
kindly
morel
was
always
indignant
with
the
drunken
men
that
they
must
sing
that
hymn
when
they
got
maudlin
as
if
were
good
enough
she
said
the
kitchen
was
full
of
the
scent
of
boiled
herbs
and
hops
on
the
hob
a
large
black
saucepan
steamed
slowly
morel
took
a
panchion
a
great
bowl
of
thick
red
earth
streamed
a
heap
of
white
sugar
into
the
bottom
and
then
straining
herself
to
the
weight
was
pouring
in
the
liquor
just
then
morel
came
in
he
had
been
very
jolly
in
the
nelson
but
coming
home
had
grown
irritable
he
had
not
quite
got
over
the
feeling
of
irritability
and
pain
after
having
slept
on
the
ground
when
he
was
so
hot
and
a
bad
conscience
afflicted
him
as
he
neared
the
house
he
did
not
know
he
was
angry
but
when
the
garden
gate
resisted
his
attempts
to
open
it
he
kicked
it
and
broke
the
latch
he
entered
just
as
morel
was
pouring
the
infusion
of
herbs
out
of
the
saucepan
swaying
slightly
he
lurched
against
the
table
the
boiling
liquor
pitched
morel
started
back
good
gracious
she
cried
coming
home
in
his
drunkenness
comin
home
in
his
what
he
snarled
his
hat
over
his
eye
suddenly
her
blood
rose
in
a
jet
say
you
not
drunk
she
flashed
she
had
put
down
her
saucepan
and
was
stirring
the
sugar
into
the
beer
he
dropped
his
two
hands
heavily
on
the
table
and
thrust
his
face
forwards
at
her
you
not
drunk
he
repeated
why
nobody
but
a
nasty
little
bitch
like
you
such
a
he
thrust
his
face
forward
at
her
there
money
to
bezzle
with
if
there
money
for
nothing
i
not
spent
a
bit
this
day
he
said
you
do
get
as
drunk
as
a
lord
on
nothing
she
replied
and
she
cried
flashing
into
sudden
fury
if
you
been
sponging
on
your
beloved
jerry
why
let
him
look
after
his
children
for
they
need
it
a
lie
it
a
lie
shut
your
face
they
were
now
at
each
forgot
everything
save
the
hatred
of
the
other
and
the
battle
between
them
she
was
fiery
and
furious
as
he
they
went
on
till
he
called
her
a
liar
no
she
cried
starting
up
scarce
able
to
breathe
do
call
me
that
you
the
most
despicable
liar
that
ever
walked
in
she
forced
the
last
words
out
of
suffocated
lungs
you
a
liar
he
yelled
banging
the
table
with
his
fist
you
a
liar

a
she
stiffened
herself
with
clenched
fists
the
house
is
filthy
with
you
she
cried
then
get

on
it

it
he
shouted
it
me
as

money
whoam

then

she
cried
suddenly
shaken
into
tears
of
impotence
ah
would
i
would
i
have
gone
long
ago
but
for
those
children
ay
have
i
repented
not

i
only
the

suddenly
drying
into
rage

think

you
i
stop

one
minute
for

then
he
shouted
beside
himself

she
faced
round
no
she
cried
loudly

have
it
all
your
own
way
you
sha
do
all

like
i
got
those
children
to
see

my
word
she
laughed
i
should
look
well
to
leave
them
to
go
he
cried
thickly
lifting
his
fist
he
was
afraid
of
her
go
i
should
be
only
too
glad
i
should
laugh
laugh
my
lord
if
i
could
get
away
from
you
she
replied
he
came
up
to
her
his
red
face
with
its
bloodshot
eyes
thrust
forward
and
gripped
her
arms
she
cried
in
fear
of
him
struggled
to
be
free
coming
slightly
to
himself
panting
he
pushed
her
roughly
to
the
outer
door
and
thrust
her
forth
slotting
the
bolt
behind
her
with
a
bang
then
he
went
back
into
the
kitchen
dropped
into
his
armchair
his
head
bursting
full
of
blood
sinking
between
his
knees
thus
he
dipped
gradually
into
a
stupor
from
exhaustion
and
intoxication
the
moon
was
high
and
magnificent
in
the
august
night
morel
seared
with
passion
shivered
to
find
herself
out
there
in
a
great
white
light
that
fell
cold
on
her
and
gave
a
shock
to
her
inflamed
soul
she
stood
for
a
few
moments
helplessly
staring
at
the
glistening
great
rhubarb
leaves
near
the
door
then
she
got
the
air
into
her
breast
she
walked
down
the
garden
path
trembling
in
every
limb
while
the
child
boiled
within
her
for
a
while
she
could
not
control
her
consciousness
mechanically
she
went
over
the
last
scene
then
over
it
again
certain
phrases
certain
moments
coming
each
time
like
a
brand
down
on
her
soul
and
each
time
she
enacted
again
the
past
hour
each
time
the
brand
came
down
at
the
same
points
till
the
mark
was
burnt
in
and
the
pain
burnt
out
and
at
last
she
came
to
herself
she
must
have
been
half
an
hour
in
this
delirious
condition
then
the
presence
of
the
night
came
again
to
her
she
glanced
round
in
fear
she
had
wandered
to
the
side
garden
where
she
was
walking
up
and
down
the
path
beside
the
currant
bushes
under
the
long
wall
the
garden
was
a
narrow
strip
bounded
from
the
road
that
cut
transversely
between
the
blocks
by
a
thick
thorn
hedge
she
hurried
out
of
the
side
garden
to
the
front
where
she
could
stand
as
if
in
an
immense
gulf
of
white
light
the
moon
streaming
high
in
face
of
her
the
moonlight
standing
up
from
the
hills
in
front
and
filling
the
valley
where
the
bottoms
crouched
almost
blindingly
there
panting
and
half
weeping
in
reaction
from
the
stress
she
murmured
to
herself
over
and
over
again
the
nuisance
the
nuisance
she
became
aware
of
something
about
her
with
an
effort
she
roused
herself
to
see
what
it
was
that
penetrated
her
consciousness
the
tall
white
lilies
were
reeling
in
the
moonlight
and
the
air
was
charged
with
their
perfume
as
with
a
presence
morel
gasped
slightly
in
fear
she
touched
the
big
pallid
flowers
on
their
petals
then
shivered
they
seemed
to
be
stretching
in
the
moonlight
she
put
her
hand
into
one
white
bin
the
gold
scarcely
showed
on
her
fingers
by
moonlight
she
bent
down
to
look
at
the
binful
of
yellow
pollen
but
it
only
appeared
dusky
then
she
drank
a
deep
draught
of
the
scent
it
almost
made
her
dizzy
morel
leaned
on
the
garden
gate
looking
out
and
she
lost
herself
awhile
she
did
not
know
what
she
thought
except
for
a
slight
feeling
of
sickness
and
her
consciousness
in
the
child
herself
melted
out
like
scent
into
the
shiny
pale
air
after
a
time
the
child
too
melted
with
her
in
the
of
moonlight
and
she
rested
with
the
hills
and
lilies
and
houses
all
swum
together
in
a
kind
of
swoon
when
she
came
to
herself
she
was
tired
for
sleep
languidly
she
looked
about
her
the
clumps
of
white
phlox
seemed
like
bushes
spread
with
linen
a
moth
ricochetted
over
them
and
right
across
the
garden
following
it
with
her
eye
roused
her
a
few
whiffs
of
the
raw
strong
scent
of
phlox
invigorated
her
she
passed
along
the
path
hesitating
at
the
white
it
smelled
sweet
and
simple
she
touched
the
white
ruffles
of
the
roses
their
fresh
scent
and
cool
soft
leaves
reminded
her
of
the
and
sunshine
she
was
very
fond
of
them
but
she
was
tired
and
wanted
to
sleep
in
the
mysterious
she
felt
forlorn
there
was
no
noise
anywhere
evidently
the
children
had
not
been
wakened
or
had
gone
to
sleep
again
a
train
three
miles
away
roared
across
the
valley
the
night
was
very
large
and
very
strange
stretching
its
hoary
distances
infinitely
and
out
of
the
fog
of
darkness
came
sounds
vague
and
hoarse
a
corncrake
not
far
off
sound
of
a
train
like
a
sigh
and
distant
shouts
of
men
her
quietened
heart
beginning
to
beat
quickly
again
she
hurried
down
the
side
garden
to
the
back
of
the
house
softly
she
lifted
the
latch
the
door
was
still
bolted
and
hard
against
her
she
rapped
gently
waited
then
rapped
again
she
must
not
rouse
the
children
nor
the
neighbours
he
must
be
asleep
and
he
would
not
wake
easily
her
heart
began
to
burn
to
be
indoors
she
clung
to
the
now
it
was
cold
she
would
take
a
chill
and
in
her
present
condition
putting
her
apron
over
her
head
and
her
arms
she
hurried
again
to
the
side
garden
to
the
window
of
the
kitchen
leaning
on
the
sill
she
could
just
see
under
the
blind
her
husband
arms
spread
out
on
the
table
and
his
black
head
on
the
board
he
was
sleeping
with
his
face
lying
on
the
table
something
in
his
attitude
made
her
feel
tired
of
things
the
lamp
was
burning
smokily
she
could
tell
by
the
copper
colour
of
the
light
she
tapped
at
the
window
more
and
more
noisily
almost
it
seemed
as
if
the
glass
would
break
still
he
did
not
wake
up
after
vain
efforts
she
began
to
shiver
partly
from
contact
with
the
stone
and
from
exhaustion
fearful
always
for
the
unborn
child
she
wondered
what
she
could
do
for
warmth
she
went
down
to
the
where
there
was
an
old
hearthrug
she
had
carried
out
for
the
the
day
before
this
she
wrapped
over
her
shoulders
it
was
warm
if
grimy
then
she
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
path
peeping
every
now
and
then
under
the
blind
knocking
and
telling
herself
that
in
the
end
the
very
strain
of
his
position
must
wake
him
at
last
after
about
an
hour
she
rapped
long
and
low
at
the
window
gradually
the
sound
penetrated
to
him
when
in
despair
she
had
ceased
to
tap
she
saw
him
stir
then
lift
his
face
blindly
the
labouring
of
his
heart
hurt
him
into
consciousness
she
rapped
imperatively
at
the
window
he
started
awake
instantly
she
saw
his
fists
set
and
his
eyes
glare
he
had
not
a
grain
of
physical
fear
if
it
had
been
twenty
burglars
he
would
have
gone
blindly
for
them
he
glared
round
bewildered
but
prepared
to
fight
open
the
door
walter
she
said
coldly
his
hands
relaxed
it
dawned
on
him
what
he
had
done
his
head
dropped
sullen
and
dogged
she
saw
him
hurry
to
the
door
heard
the
bolt
chock
he
tried
the
latch
it
opened
and
there
stood
the
night
fearful
to
him
after
the
tawny
light
of
the
lamp
he
hurried
back
when
morel
entered
she
saw
him
almost
running
through
the
door
to
the
stairs
he
had
ripped
his
collar
off
his
neck
in
his
haste
to
be
gone
ere
she
came
in
and
there
it
lay
with
bursten
it
made
her
angry
she
warmed
and
soothed
herself
in
her
weariness
forgetting
everything
she
moved
about
at
the
little
tasks
that
remained
to
be
done
set
his
breakfast
rinsed
his
put
his
on
the
hearth
to
warm
set
his
beside
them
put
him
out
a
clean
scarf
and
and
two
apples
raked
the
fire
and
went
to
bed
he
was
already
dead
asleep
his
narrow
black
eyebrows
were
drawn
up
in
a
sort
of
peevish
misery
into
his
forehead
while
his
cheeks
and
his
sulky
mouth
seemed
to
be
saying
i
do
care
who
you
are
nor
what
you
are
i
shall
have
my
own
morel
knew
him
too
well
to
look
at
him
as
she
unfastened
her
brooch
at
the
mirror
she
smiled
faintly
to
see
her
face
all
smeared
with
the
yellow
dust
of
lilies
she
brushed
it
off
and
at
last
lay
down
for
some
time
her
mind
continued
snapping
and
jetting
sparks
but
she
was
asleep
before
her
husband
awoke
from
the
first
sleep
of
his
drunkenness
chapter
ii
the
birth
of
paul
and
another
battle
after
such
a
scene
as
the
last
walter
morel
was
for
some
days
abashed
and
ashamed
but
he
soon
regained
his
old
bullying
indifference
yet
there
was
a
slight
shrinking
a
diminishing
in
his
assurance
physically
even
he
shrank
and
his
fine
full
presence
waned
he
never
grew
in
the
least
stout
so
that
as
he
sank
from
his
erect
assertive
bearing
his
physique
seemed
to
contract
along
with
his
pride
and
moral
strength
but
now
he
realised
how
hard
it
was
for
his
wife
to
drag
about
at
her
work
and
his
sympathy
quickened
by
penitence
hastened
forward
with
his
help
he
came
straight
home
from
the
pit
and
stayed
in
at
evening
till
friday
and
then
he
could
not
remain
at
home
but
he
was
back
again
by
ten
almost
quite
sober
he
always
made
his
own
breakfast
being
a
man
who
rose
early
and
had
plenty
of
time
he
did
not
as
some
miners
do
drag
his
wife
out
of
bed
at
six
at
five
sometimes
earlier
he
woke
got
straight
out
of
bed
and
went
downstairs
when
she
could
not
sleep
his
wife
lay
waiting
for
this
time
as
for
a
period
of
peace
the
only
real
rest
seemed
to
be
when
he
was
out
of
the
house
he
went
downstairs
in
his
shirt
and
then
struggled
into
his
which
were
left
on
the
hearth
to
warm
all
night
there
was
always
a
fire
because
morel
raked
and
the
first
sound
in
the
house
was
the
bang
bang
of
the
poker
against
the
raker
as
morel
smashed
the
remainder
of
the
coal
to
make
the
kettle
which
was
filled
and
left
on
the
hob
finally
boil
his
cup
and
knife
and
fork
all
he
wanted
except
just
the
food
was
laid
ready
on
the
table
on
a
newspaper
then
he
got
his
breakfast
made
the
tea
packed
the
bottom
of
the
doors
with
rugs
to
shut
out
the
draught
piled
a
big
fire
and
sat
down
to
an
hour
of
joy
he
toasted
his
bacon
on
a
fork
and
caught
the
drops
of
fat
on
his
bread
then
he
put
the
rasher
on
his
thick
slice
of
bread
and
cut
off
chunks
with
a
poured
his
tea
into
his
saucer
and
was
happy
with
his
family
about
meals
were
never
so
pleasant
he
loathed
a
fork
it
is
a
modern
introduction
which
has
still
scarcely
reached
common
people
what
morel
preferred
was
a
then
in
solitude
he
ate
and
drank
often
sitting
in
cold
weather
on
a
little
stool
with
his
back
to
the
warm
his
food
on
the
fender
his
cup
on
the
hearth
and
then
he
read
the
last
night
newspaper
what
of
it
he
could
spelling
it
over
laboriously
he
preferred
to
keep
the
blinds
down
and
the
candle
lit
even
when
it
was
daylight
it
was
the
habit
of
the
mine
at
a
quarter
to
six
he
rose
cut
two
thick
slices
of
bread
and
butter
and
put
them
in
the
white
calico
he
filled
his
tin
bottle
with
tea
cold
tea
without
milk
or
sugar
was
the
drink
he
preferred
for
the
pit
then
he
pulled
off
his
shirt
and
put
on
his
a
vest
of
thick
flannel
cut
low
round
the
neck
and
with
short
sleeves
like
a
chemise
then
he
went
upstairs
to
his
wife
with
a
cup
of
tea
because
she
was
ill
and
because
it
occurred
to
him
i
brought
thee
a
cup
o
tea
lass
he
said
well
you
need
for
you
know
i
do
like
it
she
replied
drink
it
up
it
pop
thee
off
to
sleep
she
accepted
the
tea
it
pleased
him
to
see
her
take
it
and
sip
it
i
back
my
life
there
no
sugar
in
she
said
yi
there
one
big
he
replied
injured
it
a
wonder
she
said
sipping
again
she
had
a
winsome
face
when
her
hair
was
loose
he
loved
her
to
grumble
at
him
in
this
manner
he
looked
at
her
again
and
went
without
any
sort
of
he
never
took
more
than
two
slices
of
bread
and
butter
to
eat
in
the
pit
so
an
apple
or
an
orange
was
a
treat
to
him
he
always
liked
it
when
she
put
one
out
for
him
he
tied
a
scarf
round
his
neck
put
on
his
great
heavy
boots
his
coat
with
the
big
pocket
that
carried
his
and
his
bottle
of
tea
and
went
forth
into
the
fresh
morning
air
closing
without
locking
the
door
behind
him
he
loved
the
early
morning
and
the
walk
across
the
fields
so
he
appeared
at
the
often
with
a
stalk
from
the
hedge
between
his
teeth
which
he
chewed
all
day
to
keep
his
mouth
moist
down
the
mine
feeling
quite
as
happy
as
when
he
was
in
the
field
later
when
the
time
for
the
baby
grew
nearer
he
would
bustle
round
in
his
slovenly
fashion
poking
out
the
ashes
rubbing
the
fireplace
sweeping
the
house
before
he
went
to
work
then
feeling
very
he
went
upstairs
now
i
cleaned
up
for
thee
tha
no
ter
stir
a
peg
all
day
but
sit
and
read
thy
which
made
her
laugh
in
spite
of
her
indignation
and
the
dinner
cooks
itself
she
answered
eh
i
know
nowt
about
th
you
know
if
there
were
ay
so
he
answered
departing
when
she
got
downstairs
she
would
find
the
house
tidy
but
dirty
she
could
not
rest
until
she
had
thoroughly
cleaned
so
she
went
down
to
the
with
her
dustpan
kirk
spying
her
would
contrive
to
have
to
go
to
her
own
at
that
minute
then
across
the
wooden
fence
she
would
call
so
you
keep
wagging
on
then
ay
answered
morel
deprecatingly

a
very
small
woman
from
across
the
road

a
brown
velvet
dress
tight

he
at
the
the
two
women
looked
down
the
alley
at
the
end
of
the
bottoms
a
man
stood
in
a
sort
of
trap
bending
over
bundles
of
stuff
while
a
cluster
of
women
held
up
their
arms
to
him
some
with
bundles
anthony

had
a
heap
of
creamy
undyed
stockings

man
a
common
fellow
made
jokes
with
them
tried
to
swindle
them
and
bullied
them
morel
went
up
her
yard
disdainfully
it
was
an
understood
thing
that
if
one
woman
wanted
her
neighbour
she
should
put
the
poker
in
the
fire
and
bang
at
the
back
of
the
fireplace
which
as
the
fires
were
back
to
back
would
make
a
great
noise
in
the
adjoining
house
one
morning
kirk
mixing
a
pudding
nearly
started
out
of
her
skin
as
she
heard
the
thud
thud
in
her
grate

her
hands

rushed
to
the
fence

morel
kirk
went
into
the
yard
lifted
up
her
strong
shrill
voice
and
called
the
sound

heard
from
one
end
of
the
bottoms
to
the
other
at
last
aggie

morel
was
not
as
a
rule
one
of
the
first
to
appear
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
ready
to
come
up
some
men
were
there
before
four
when
the
whistle
blew
but
morel
whose
stall
a
poor
one
was
at
this
time
about
a
mile
and
a
half
away
from
the
bottom
worked
usually
till
the
first
mate
stopped
then
he
finished
also
this
day
however
the
miner
was
sick
of
the
work
at
two
he
looked
at
his
watch
by
the
light
of
the
green
candle
he
was
in
a
safe
working
and
again
at
two
he
was
hewing
at
a
piece
of
rock
that
was
in
the
way
for
the
next
day
work
as
he
sat
on
his
heels
or
kneeled
giving
hard
blows
with
his
pick

barker
but
morel
was
too
exasperated
at
the
end
of
his
tether
to

he
struck
and
hacked

all
his
might

said
barker
departing
when
he
had
gone
morel
left
alone
felt
savage
he
had
not
finished
his
job
he
had
overworked
himself
into
a
frenzy
rising
wet
with
sweat
he
threw
his
tool
down
pulled
on
his
coat
blew
out
his
candle
took
his
lamp
and
went
down
the
main
road
the
lights
of
the
other
men
went
swinging
there
was
a
hollow
sound
of
many
voices
it
was
a
long
heavy
tramp
underground
he
sat
at
the
bottom
of
the
pit
where
the
great
drops
of
water
fell
plash
many
colliers
were
waiting
their
turns
to
go
up
talking
noisily
morel
gave
his
answers
short
and
disagreeable
it
rainin
sorry
said
old
giles
who
had
had
the
news
from
the
top
morel
found
one
comfort
he
had
his
old
umbrella
which
he
loved
in
the
lamp
cabin
at
last
he
took
his
stand
on
the
chair
and
was
at
the
top
in
a
moment
then
he
handed
in
his
lamp
and
got
his
umbrella
which
he
had
bought
at
an
auction
for
he
stood
on
the
edge
of
the
for
a
moment
looking
out
over
the
fields
grey
rain
was
falling
the
trucks
stood
full
of
wet
bright
coal
water
ran
down
the
sides
of
the
waggons
over
the
white
and
colliers
walking
indifferent
to
the
rain
were
streaming
down
the
line
and
up
the
field
a
grey
dismal
host
morel
put
up
his
umbrella
and
took
pleasure
from
the
peppering
of
the
drops
thereon
all
along
the
road
to
bestwood
the
miners
tramped
wet
and
grey
and
dirty
but
their
red
mouths
talking
with
animation
morel
also
walked
with
a
gang
but
he
said
nothing
he
frowned
peevishly
as
he
went
many
men
passed
into
the
prince
of
wales
or
into
ellen
morel
feeling
sufficiently
disagreeable
to
resist
temptation
trudged
along
under
the
dripping
trees
that
overhung
the
park
wall
and
down
the
mud
of
greenhill
lane
morel
lay
in
bed
listening
to
the
rain
and
the
feet
of
the
colliers
from
minton
their
voices
and
the
bang
bang
of
the
gates
as
they
went
through
the
stile
up
the
field
there
some
herb
beer
behind
the
pantry
door
she
said
master
want
a
drink
if
he
does
but
he
was
late
so
she
concluded
he
had
called
for
a
drink
since
it
was
raining
what
did
he
care
about
the
child
or
her
she
was
very
ill
when
her
children
were
born
what
is
it
she
asked
feeling
sick
to
death
a
and
she
took
consolation
in
that
the
thought
of
being
the
mother
of
men
was
warming
to
her
heart
she
looked
at
the
child
it
had
blue
eyes
and
a
lot
of
fair
hair
and
was
bonny
her
love
came
up
hot
in
spite
of
everything
she
had
it
in
bed
with
her
morel
thinking
nothing
dragged
his
way
up
the
garden
path
wearily
and
angrily
he
closed
his
umbrella
and
stood
it
in
the
sink
then
he
sluthered
his
heavy
boots
into
the
kitchen
bower
appeared
in
the
inner
doorway
well
she
said
she
about
as
bad
as
she
can
be
it
a
boy
the
miner
grunted
put
his
empty
and
his
tin
bottle
on
the
dresser
went
back
into
the
scullery
and
hung
up
his
coat
then
came
and
dropped
into
his
chair
han
yer
got
a
drink
he
asked
the
woman
went
into
the
pantry
there
was
heard
the
pop
of
a
cork
she
set
the
mug
with
a
little
disgusted
rap
on
the
table
before
morel
he
drank
gasped
wiped
his
big
moustache
on
the
end
of
his
scarf
drank
gasped
and
lay
back
in
his
chair
the
woman
would
not
speak
to
him
again
she
set
his
dinner
before
him
and
went
upstairs
was
that
the
master
asked
morel
i
gave
him
his
dinner
replied
bower
after
he
had
sat
with
his
arms
on
the
table
he
resented
the
fact
that
bower
put
no
cloth
on
for
him
and
gave
him
a
little
plate
instead
of
a
he
began
to
eat
the
fact
that
his
wife
was
ill
that
he
had
another
boy
was
nothing
to
him
at
that
moment
he
was
too
tired
he
wanted
his
dinner
he
wanted
to
sit
with
his
arms
lying
on
the
board
he
did
not
like
having
bower
about
the
fire
was
too
small
to
please
him
after
he
had
finished
his
meal
he
sat
for
twenty
minutes
then
he
stoked
up
a
big
fire
then
in
his
stockinged
feet
he
went
reluctantly
upstairs
it
was
a
struggle
to
face
his
wife
at
this
moment
and
he
was
tired
his
face
was
black
and
smeared
with
sweat
his
singlet
had
dried
again
soaking
the
dirt
in
he
had
a
dirty
woollen
scarf
round
his
throat
so
he
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
well
how
are
ter
then
he
asked
i
s
be
all
right
she
answered
h
he
stood
at
a
loss
what
to
say
next
he
was
tired
and
this
bother
was
rather
a
nuisance
to
him
and
he
did
quite
know
where
he
was
a
lad
tha
says
he
stammered
she
turned
down
the
sheet
and
showed
the
child
bless
him
he
murmured
which
made
her
laugh
because
he
blessed
by
rote
pretending
paternal
emotion
which
he
did
not
feel
just
then
go
now
she
said
i
will
my
lass
he
answered
turning
away
dismissed
he
wanted
to
kiss
her
but
he
dared
not
she
half
wanted
him
to
kiss
her
but
could
not
bring
herself
to
give
any
sign
she
only
breathed
freely
when
he
was
gone
out
of
the
room
again
leaving
behind
him
a
faint
smell
of
morel
had
a
visit
every
day
from
the
congregational
clergyman
heaton
was
young
and
very
poor
his
wife
had
died
at
the
birth
of
his
first
baby
so
he
remained
alone
in
the
manse
he
was
a
bachelor
of
arts
of
cambridge
very
shy
and
no
preacher
morel
was
fond
of
him
and
he
depended
on
her
for
hours
he
talked
to
her
when
she
was
well
he
became
the
of
the
child
occasionally
the
minister
stayed
to
tea
with
morel
then
she
laid
the
cloth
early
got
out
her
best
cups
with
a
little
green
rim
and
hoped
morel
would
not
come
too
soon
indeed
if
he
stayed
for
a
pint
she
would
not
mind
this
day
she
had
always
two
dinners
to
cook
because
she
believed
children
should
have
their
chief
meal
at
midday
whereas
morel
needed
his
at
five
so
heaton
would
hold
the
baby
whilst
morel
beat
up
a
or
peeled
the
potatoes
and
he
watching
her
all
the
time
would
discuss
his
next
sermon
his
ideas
were
quaint
and
fantastic
she
brought
him
judiciously
to
earth
it
was
a
discussion
of
the
wedding
at
cana
when
he
changed
the
water
into
wine
at
cana
he
said
that
is
a
symbol
that
the
ordinary
life
even
the
blood
of
the
married
husband
and
wife
which
had
before
been
uninspired
like
water
became
filled
with
the
spirit
and
was
as
wine
because
when
love
enters
the
whole
spiritual
constitution
of
a
man
changes
is
filled
with
the
holy
ghost
and
almost
his
form
is
morel
thought
to
herself
yes
poor
fellow
his
young
wife
is
dead
that
is
why
he
makes
his
love
into
the
holy
they
were
halfway
down
their
first
cup
of
tea
when
they
heard
the
sluther
of
good
gracious
exclaimed
morel
in
spite
of
herself
the
minister
looked
rather
scared
morel
entered
he
was
feeling
rather
savage
he
nodded
a
how
do
to
the
clergyman
who
rose
to
shake
hands
with
him
nay
said
morel
showing
his
hand
look
thee
at
it
tha
niver
wants
ter
shake
hands
wi
a
hand
like
that
does
ter
there
too
much
and
on
the
minister
flushed
with
confusion
and
sat
down
again
morel
rose
carried
out
the
steaming
saucepan
morel
took
off
his
coat
dragged
his
armchair
to
table
and
sat
down
heavily
are
you
tired
asked
the
clergyman
tired
i
ham
that
replied
morel
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
tired
as
i
no
replied
the
clergyman
why
look
yer
said
the
miner
showing
the
shoulders
of
his
singlet
it
a
bit
dry
now
but
it
wet
as
a
clout
with
sweat
even
yet
feel
goodness
cried
morel
mr
heaton

the
clergyman
put
out
his
hand
gingerly
no

morel
but
it
all
come
out
of
me
whether
or
not

day
alike

singlet

a
drink

a
man
when

from

pit

morel
pouring
out
his
tea
an

there
no
more
to
be
got
turning
to
the
clergyman
a
man
gets
that

know
that
clogged

as
clear
his
he
poured
out
a
saucerful
of
tea
blew
it
and
sucked
it
up
through
his
great
black
moustache
sighing
afterwards
then
he
poured
out
another
saucerful
and
stood
his
cup
on
the
table
my
cloth
said
morel
putting
it
on
a
plate
a
man
as
comes
home
as
i
do
too
tired
to
care
about
cloths
said
morel
pity
exclaimed
his
wife
sarcastically
the
room
was
full
of
the
smell
of
meat
and
vegetables
and
he
leaned
over
to
the
minister
his
great
moustache
thrust
forward
his
mouth
very
red
in
his
black
face
mr
heaton
he
said
a
man
as
has
been
down
the
black
hole
all
day
dingin
away
at
a
yi
a
sight
harder
than
that
wall
need
make
a
moan
of
it
put
in
morel
she
hated
her
husband
because
whenever
he
had
an
audience
he
whined
and
played
for
sympathy
william
sitting
nursing
the
baby
hated
him
with
a
boy
hatred
for
false
sentiment
and
for
the
stupid
treatment
of
his
mother
annie
had
never
liked
him
she
merely
avoided
him
when
the
minister
had
gone
morel
looked
at
her
cloth
a
fine
mess
she
said
think
i
goin
to
sit
wi
my
arms
danglin
cos
tha
got
a
parson
for
tea
wi
thee
he
bawled
they
were
both
angry
but
she
said
nothing
the
baby
began
to
cry
and
morel
picking
up
a
saucepan
from
the
hearth
accidentally
knocked
annie
on
the
head
whereupon
the
girl
began
to
whine
and
morel
to
shout
at
her
in
the
midst
of
this
pandemonium
william
looked
up
at
the
big
glazed
text
over
the
mantelpiece
and
read
distinctly
god
bless
our
home
whereupon
morel
trying
to
soothe
the
baby
jumped
up
rushed
at
him
boxed
his
ears
saying
what
are
you
putting
in
for
and
then
she
sat
down
and
laughed
till
tears
ran
over
her
cheeks
while
william
kicked
the
stool
he
had
been
sitting
on
and
morel
growled
i
canna
see
what
there
is
so
much
to
laugh
one
evening
directly
after
the
parson
visit
feeling
unable
to
bear
herself
after
another
display
from
her
husband
she
took
annie
and
the
baby
and
went
out
morel
had
kicked
william
and
the
mother
would
never
forgive
him
she
went
over
the
and
across
a
corner
of
the
meadow
to
the
the
meadows
seemed
one
space
of
ripe
evening
light
whispering
with
the
distant
she
sat
on
a
seat
under
the
alders
in
the
and
fronted
the
evening
before
her
level
and
solid
spread
the
big
green
like
the
bed
of
a
sea
of
light
children
played
in
the
bluish
shadow
of
the
pavilion
many
rooks
high
up
came
cawing
home
across
the
sky
they
stooped
in
a
long
curve
down
into
the
golden
glow
concentrating
cawing
wheeling
like
black
flakes
on
a
slow
vortex
over
a
tree
clump
that
made
a
dark
boss
among
the
pasture
a
few
gentlemen
were
practising
and
morel
could
hear
the
chock
of
the
ball
and
the
voices
of
men
suddenly
roused
could
see
the
white
forms
of
men
shifting
silently
over
the
green
upon
which
already
the
under
shadows
were
smouldering
away
at
the
grange
one
side
of
the
haystacks
was
lit
up
the
other
sides
a
waggon
of
sheaves
rocked
small
across
the
melting
yellow
light
the
sun
was
going
down
every
open
evening
the
hills
of
derbyshire
were
blazed
over
with
red
sunset
morel
watched
the
sun
sink
from
the
glistening
sky
leaving
a
soft
overhead
while
the
western
space
went
red
as
if
all
the
fire
had
swum
down
there
leaving
the
bell
cast
flawless
blue
the
berries
across
the
field
stood
fierily
out
from
the
dark
leaves
for
a
moment
a
few
shocks
of
corn
in
a
corner
of
the
fallow
stood
up
as
if
alive
she
imagined
them
bowing
perhaps
her
son
would
be
a
joseph
in
the
east
a
mirrored
sunset
floated
pink
opposite
the
west
scarlet
the
big
haystacks
on
the
hillside
that
butted
into
the
glare
went
cold
with
morel
it
was
one
of
those
still
moments
when
the
small
frets
vanish
and
the
beauty
of
things
stands
out
and
she
had
the
peace
and
the
strength
to
see
herself
now
and
again
a
swallow
cut
close
to
her
now
and
again
annie
came
up
with
a
handful
of
the
baby
was
restless
on
his
mother
knee
clambering
with
his
hands
at
the
light
morel
looked
down
at
him
she
had
dreaded
this
baby
like
a
catastrophe
because
of
her
feeling
for
her
husband
and
now
she
felt
strangely
towards
the
infant
her
heart
was
heavy
because
of
the
child
almost
as
if
it
were
unhealthy
or
malformed
yet
it
seemed
quite
well
but
she
noticed
the
peculiar
knitting
of
the
baby
brows
and
the
peculiar
heaviness
of
its
eyes
as
if
it
were
trying
to
understand
something
that
was
pain
she
felt
when
she
looked
at
her
child
dark
brooding
pupils
as
if
a
burden
were
on
her
heart
he
looks
as
if
he
was
thinking
about
something
quite
sorrowful
said
kirk
suddenly
looking
at
him
the
heavy
feeling
at
the
mother
heart
melted
into
passionate
grief
she
bowed
over
him
and
a
few
tears
shook
swiftly
out
of
her
very
heart
the
baby
lifted
his
fingers
my
lamb
she
cried
softly
and
at
that
moment
she
felt
in
some
far
inner
place
of
her
soul
that
she
and
her
husband
were
guilty
the
baby
was
looking
up
at
her
it
had
blue
eyes
like
her
own
but
its
look
was
heavy
steady
as
if
it
had
realised
something
that
had
stunned
some
point
of
its
soul
in
her
arms
lay
the
delicate
baby
its
deep
blue
eyes
always
looking
up
at
her
unblinking
seemed
to
draw
her
innermost
thoughts
out
of
her
she
no
longer
loved
her
husband
she
had
not
wanted
this
child
to
come
and
there
it
lay
in
her
arms
and
pulled
at
her
heart
she
felt
as
if
the
navel
string
that
had
connected
its
frail
little
body
with
hers
had
not
been
broken
a
wave
of
hot
love
went
over
her
to
the
infant
she
held
it
close
to
her
face
and
breast
with
all
her
force
with
all
her
soul
she
would
make
up
to
it
for
having
brought
it
into
the
world
unloved
she
would
love
it
all
the
more
now
it
was
here
carry
it
in
her
love
its
clear
knowing
eyes
gave
her
pain
and
fear
did
it
know
all
about
her
when
it
lay
under
her
heart
had
it
been
listening
then
was
there
a
reproach
in
the
look
she
felt
the
marrow
melt
in
her
bones
with
fear
and
pain
once
more
she
was
aware
of
the
sun
lying
red
on
the
rim
of
the
hill
opposite
she
suddenly
held
up
the
child
in
her
hands
look
she
said
look
my
pretty
she
thrust
the
infant
forward
to
the
crimson
throbbing
sun
almost
with
relief
she
saw
him
lift
his
little
fist
then
she
put
him
to
her
bosom
again
ashamed
almost
of
her
impulse
to
give
him
back
again
whence
he
came
if
he
lives
she
thought
to
herself
what
will
become
of
him
what
will
he
be
her
heart
was
anxious
i
will
call
him
paul
she
said
suddenly
she
knew
not
why
after
a
while
she
went
home
a
fine
shadow
was
flung
over
the
deep
green
meadow
darkening
all
as
she
expected
she
found
the
house
empty
but
morel
was
home
by
ten
and
that
day
at
least
ended
peacefully
walter
morel
was
at
this
time
exceedingly
irritable
his
work
seemed
to
exhaust
him
when
he
came
home
he
did
not
speak
civilly
to
anybody
if
the
fire
were
rather
low
he
bullied
about
that
he
grumbled
about
his
dinner
if
the
children
made
a
chatter
he
shouted
at
them
in
a
way
that
made
their
mother
blood
boil
and
made
them
hate
him
on
the
friday
he
was
not
home
by
eleven
the
baby
was
unwell
and
was
restless
crying
if
he
were
put
down
morel
tired
to
death
and
still
weak
was
scarcely
under
control
i
wish
the
nuisance
would
come
she
said
wearily
to
herself
the
child
at
last
sank
down
to
sleep
in
her
arms
she
was
too
tired
to
carry
him
to
the
cradle
but
i
say
nothing
whatever
time
he
comes
she
said
it
only
works
me
up
i
wo
say
anything
but
i
know
if
he
does
anything
it
make
my
blood
boil
she
added
to
herself
she
sighed
hearing
him
coming
as
if
it
were
something
she
could
not
bear
he
taking
his
revenge
was
nearly
drunk
she
kept
her
head
bent
over
the
child
as
he
entered
not
wishing
to
see
him
but
it
went
through
her
like
a
flash
of
hot
fire
when
in
passing
he
lurched
against
the
dresser
setting
the
tins
rattling
and
clutched
at
the
white
pot
knobs
for
support
he
hung
up
his
hat
and
coat
then
returned
stood
glowering
from
a
distance
at
her
as
she
sat
bowed
over
the
child
is
there
nothing
to
eat
in
the
house
he
asked
insolently
as
if
to
a
servant
in
certain
stages
of
his
intoxication
he
affected
the
clipped
mincing
speech
of
the
towns
morel
hated
him
most
in
this
condition
you
know
what
there
is
in
the
house
she
said
so
coldly
it
sounded
impersonal
he
stood
and
glared
at
her
without
moving
a
muscle
i
asked
a
civil
question
and
i
expect
a
civil
answer
he
said
affectedly
and
you
got
it
she
said
still
ignoring
him
he
glowered
again
then
he
came
unsteadily
forward
he
leaned
on
the
table
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
jerked
at
the
table
drawer
to
get
a
knife
to
cut
bread
the
drawer
stuck
because
he
pulled
sideways
in
a
temper
he
dragged
it
so
that
it
flew
out
bodily
and
spoons
forks
knives
a
hundred
metallic
things
splashed
with
a
clatter
and
a
clang
upon
the
brick
floor
the
baby
gave
a
little
convulsed
start
what
are
you
doing
clumsy
drunken
fool
the
mother
cried
then
tha
should
get
the
flamin
thing
thysen
tha
should
get
up
like
other
women
have
to
an
wait
on
a
wait
on

wait
on

she
cried
yes

see
yis
an
i
learn
thee
tha
got
to
wait
on
me
yes
tha
wait
on
me
never
milord
i
wait
on
a
dog
at
the
door
what
what
he
was
trying
to
fit
in
the
drawer
at
her
last
speech
he
turned
round
his
face
was
crimson
his
eyes
bloodshot
he
stared
at
her
one
silent
second
in
threat
she
went
quickly
in
contempt
he
jerked
at
the
drawer
in
his
excitement
it
fell
cut
sharply
on
his
shin
and
on
the
reflex
he
flung
it
at
her
one
of
the
corners
caught
her
brow
as
the
shallow
drawer
crashed
into
the
fireplace
she
swayed
almost
fell
stunned
from
her
chair
to
her
very
soul
she
was
sick
she
clasped
the
child
tightly
to
her
bosom
a
few
moments
elapsed
then
with
an
effort
she
brought
herself
to
the
baby
was
crying
plaintively
her
left
brow
was
bleeding
rather
profusely
as
she
glanced
down
at
the
child
her
brain
reeling
some
drops
of
blood
soaked
into
its
white
shawl
but
the
baby
was
at
least
not
hurt
she
balanced
her
head
to
keep
equilibrium
so
that
the
blood
ran
into
her
eye
walter
morel
remained
as
he
had
stood
leaning
on
the
table
with
one
hand
looking
blank
when
he
was
sufficiently
sure
of
his
balance
he
went
across
to
her
swayed
caught
hold
of
the
back
of
her
almost
tipping
her
out
then
leaning
forward
over
her
and
swaying
as
he
spoke
he
said
in
a
tone
of
wondering
concern
did
it
catch
thee
he
swayed
again
as
if
he
would
pitch
on
to
the
child
with
the
catastrophe
he
had
lost
all
balance
go
away
she
said
struggling
to
keep
her
presence
of
mind
he
hiccoughed
let
let
look
at
it
he
said
hiccoughing
again
go
away
she
cried
lem
me
lem
me
look
at
it
she
smelled
him
of
drink
felt
the
unequal
pull
of
his
swaying
grasp
on
the
back
of
her
go
away
she
said
and
weakly
she
pushed
him
off
he
stood
uncertain
in
balance
gazing
upon
her
summoning
all
her
strength
she
rose
the
baby
on
one
arm
by
a
cruel
effort
of
will
moving
as
if
in
sleep
she
went
across
to
the
scullery
where
she
bathed
her
eye
for
a
minute
in
cold
water
but
she
was
too
dizzy
afraid
lest
she
should
swoon
she
returned
to
her
trembling
in
every
fibre
by
instinct
she
kept
the
baby
clasped
morel
bothered
had
succeeded
in
pushing
the
drawer
back
into
its
cavity
and
was
on
his
knees
groping
with
numb
paws
for
the
scattered
spoons
her
brow
was
still
bleeding
presently
morel
got
up
and
came
craning
his
neck
towards
her
what
has
it
done
to
thee
lass
he
asked
in
a
very
wretched
humble
tone
you
can
see
what
it
done
she
answered
he
stood
bending
forward
supported
on
his
hands
which
grasped
his
legs
just
above
the
knee
he
peered
to
look
at
the
wound
she
drew
away
from
the
thrust
of
his
face
with
its
great
moustache
averting
her
own
face
as
much
as
possible
as
he
looked
at
her
who
was
cold
and
impassive
as
stone
with
mouth
shut
tight
he
sickened
with
feebleness
and
hopelessness
of
spirit
he
was
turning
drearily
away
when
he
saw
a
drop
of
blood
fall
from
the
averted
wound
into
the
baby
fragile
glistening
hair
fascinated
he
watched
the
heavy
dark
drop
hang
in
the
glistening
cloud
and
pull
down
the
gossamer
another
drop
fell
it
would
soak
through
to
the
baby
scalp
he
watched
fascinated
feeling
it
soak
in
then
finally
his
manhood
broke
what
of
this
child
was
all
his
wife
said
to
him
but
her
low
intense
tones
brought
his
head
lower
she
softened
get
me
some
wadding
out
of
the
middle
drawer
she
said
he
stumbled
away
very
obediently
presently
returning
with
a
pad
which
she
singed
before
the
fire
then
put
on
her
forehead
as
she
sat
with
the
baby
on
her
lap
now
that
clean
again
he
rummaged
and
fumbled
in
the
drawer
returning
presently
with
a
red
narrow
scarf
she
took
it
and
with
trembling
fingers
proceeded
to
bind
it
round
her
head
let
me
tie
it
for
thee
he
said
humbly
i
can
do
it
myself
she
replied
when
it
was
done
she
went
upstairs
telling
him
to
rake
the
fire
and
lock
the
door
in
the
morning
morel
said
i
knocked
against
the
latch
of
the
when
i
was
getting
a
raker
in
the
dark
because
the
candle
blew
her
two
small
children
looked
up
at
her
with
wide
dismayed
eyes
they
said
nothing
but
their
parted
lips
seemed
to
express
the
unconscious
tragedy
they
felt
walter
morel
lay
in
bed
next
day
until
nearly
he
did
not
think
of
the
previous
evening
work
he
scarcely
thought
of
anything
but
he
would
not
think
of
that
he
lay
and
suffered
like
a
sulking
dog
he
had
hurt
himself
most
and
he
was
the
more
damaged
because
he
would
never
say
a
word
to
her
or
express
his
sorrow
he
tried
to
wriggle
out
of
it
it
was
her
own
fault
he
said
to
himself
nothing
however
could
prevent
his
inner
consciousness
inflicting
on
him
the
punishment
which
ate
into
his
spirit
like
rust
and
which
he
could
only
alleviate
by
drinking
he
felt
as
if
he
had
not
the
initiative
to
get
up
or
to
say
a
word
or
to
move
but
could
only
lie
like
a
log
moreover
he
had
himself
violent
pains
in
the
head
it
was
saturday
towards
noon
he
rose
cut
himself
food
in
the
pantry
ate
it
with
his
head
dropped
then
pulled
on
his
boots
and
went
out
to
return
at
three
slightly
tipsy
and
relieved
then
once
more
straight
to
bed
he
rose
again
at
six
in
the
evening
had
tea
and
went
straight
out
sunday
was
the
same
bed
till
noon
the
palmerston
arms
till
dinner
and
bed
scarcely
a
word
spoken
when
morel
went
upstairs
towards
four
to
put
on
her
sunday
dress
he
was
fast
asleep
she
would
have
felt
sorry
for
him
if
he
had
once
said
wife
but
no
he
insisted
to
himself
it
was
her
fault
and
so
he
broke
himself
so
she
merely
left
him
alone
there
was
this
deadlock
of
passion
between
them
and
she
was
stronger
the
family
began
tea
sunday
was
the
only
day
when
all
sat
down
to
meals
together
is
my
father
going
to
get
up
asked
william
let
him
lie
the
mother
replied
there
was
a
feeling
of
misery
over
all
the
house
the
children
breathed
the
air
that
was
poisoned
and
they
felt
dreary
they
were
rather
disconsolate
did
not
know
what
to
do
what
to
play
at
immediately
morel
woke
he
got
straight
out
of
bed
that
was
characteristic
of
him
all
his
life
he
was
all
for
activity
the
prostrated
inactivity
of
two
mornings
was
stifling
him
it
was
near
six
when
he
got
down
this
time
he
entered
without
hesitation
his
wincing
sensitiveness
having
hardened
again
he
did
not
care
any
longer
what
the
family
thought
or
felt
the
were
on
the
table
william
was
reading
aloud
from
the
child
own
annie
listening
and
asking
eternally
why
both
children
hushed
into
silence
as
they
heard
the
approaching
thud
of
their
stockinged
feet
and
shrank
as
he
entered
yet
he
was
usually
indulgent
to
them
morel
made
the
meal
alone
brutally
he
ate
and
drank
more
noisily
than
he
had
need
no
one
spoke
to
him
the
family
life
withdrew
shrank
away
and
became
hushed
as
he
entered
but
he
cared
no
longer
about
his
alienation
immediately
he
had
finished
tea
he
rose
with
alacrity
to
go
out
it
was
this
alacrity
this
haste
to
be
gone
which
so
sickened
morel
as
she
heard
him
sousing
heartily
in
cold
water
heard
the
eager
scratch
of
the
steel
comb
on
the
side
of
the
bowl
as
he
wetted
his
hair
she
closed
her
eyes
in
disgust
as
he
bent
over
lacing
his
boots
there
was
a
certain
vulgar
gusto
in
his
movement
that
divided
him
from
the
reserved
watchful
rest
of
the
family
he
always
ran
away
from
the
battle
with
himself
even
in
his
own
heart
privacy
he
excused
himself
saying
if
she
had
said
it
would
never
have
happened
she
asked
for
what
she
the
children
waited
in
restraint
during
his
preparations
when
he
had
gone
they
sighed
with
relief
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
was
glad
it
was
a
rainy
evening
the
palmerston
would
be
the
cosier
he
hastened
forward
in
anticipation
all
the
slate
roofs
of
the
bottoms
shone
black
with
wet
the
roads
always
dark
with
were
full
of
blackish
mud
he
hastened
along
the
palmerston
windows
were
steamed
over
the
passage
was
paddled
with
wet
feet
but
the
air
was
warm
if
foul
and
full
of
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
smell
of
beer
and
smoke
what
shollt
walter
cried
a
voice
as
soon
as
morel
appeared
in
the
doorway
oh
jim
my
lad
wheriver
has
thee
sprung
frae
the
men
made
a
seat
for
him
and
took
him
in
warmly
he
was
glad
in
a
minute
or
two
they
had
thawed
all
responsibility
out
of
him
all
shame
all
trouble
and
he
was
clear
as
a
bell
for
a
jolly
night
on
the
wednesday
following
morel
was
penniless
he
dreaded
his
wife
having
hurt
her
he
hated
her
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
himself
that
evening
having
not
even
twopence
with
which
to
go
to
the
palmerston
and
being
already
rather
deeply
in
debt
so
while
his
wife
was
down
the
garden
with
the
child
he
hunted
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
dresser
where
she
kept
her
purse
found
it
and
looked
inside
it
contained
a
two
halfpennies
and
a
sixpence
so
he
took
the
sixpence
put
the
purse
carefully
back
and
went
out
the
next
day
when
she
wanted
to
pay
the
greengrocer
she
looked
in
the
purse
for
her
sixpence
and
her
heart
sank
to
her
shoes
then
she
sat
down
and
thought
was
there
a
sixpence
i
had
spent
it
had
i
and
i
had
left
it
anywhere
else
she
was
much
put
about
she
hunted
round
everywhere
for
it
and
as
she
sought
the
conviction
came
into
her
heart
that
her
husband
had
taken
it
what
she
had
in
her
purse
was
all
the
money
she
possessed
but
that
he
should
sneak
it
from
her
thus
was
unbearable
he
had
done
so
twice
before
the
first
time
she
had
not
accused
him
and
at
the
he
had
put
the
shilling
again
into
her
purse
so
that
was
how
she
had
known
he
had
taken
it
the
second
time
he
had
not
paid
back
this
time
she
felt
it
was
too
much
when
he
had
had
his
dinner
he
came
home
early
that
day
she
said
to
him
coldly
did
you
take
sixpence
out
of
my
purse
last
night
me
he
said
looking
up
in
an
offended
way
no
i
didna
i
niver
clapped
eyes
on
your
but
she
could
detect
the
lie
why
you
know
you
did
she
said
quietly
i
tell
you
i
didna
he
shouted
yer
at
me
again
are
yer
i
had
about
enough
so
you
filch
sixpence
out
of
my
purse
while
i
taking
the
clothes
i
may
yer
pay
for
this
he
said
pushing
back
his
chair
in
desperation
he
bustled
and
got
washed
then
went
determinedly
upstairs
presently
he
came
down
dressed
and
with
a
big
bundle
in
a
enormous
handkerchief
and
now
he
said
you
see
me
again
when
you
it
be
before
i
want
to
she
replied
and
at
that
he
marched
out
of
the
house
with
his
bundle
she
sat
trembling
slightly
but
her
heart
brimming
with
contempt
what
would
she
do
if
he
went
to
some
other
pit
obtained
work
and
got
in
with
another
woman
but
she
knew
him
too
well
he
could
she
was
dead
sure
of
him
nevertheless
her
heart
was
gnawed
inside
her
where
my
dad
said
william
coming
in
from
school
he
says
he
run
away
replied
the
mother
where
to
eh
i
do
know
he
taken
a
bundle
in
the
blue
handkerchief
and
says
he
not
coming
what
shall
we
do
cried
the
boy
eh
never
trouble
he
wo
go
but
if
he
does
come
back
wailed
annie
and
she
and
william
retired
to
the
sofa
and
wept
morel
sat
and
laughed
you
pair
of
gabeys
she
exclaimed
you
see
him
before
the
but
the
children
were
not
to
be
consoled
twilight
came
on
morel
grew
anxious
from
very
weariness
one
part
of
her
said
it
would
be
a
relief
to
see
the
last
of
him
another
part
fretted
because
of
keeping
the
children
and
inside
her
as
yet
she
could
not
quite
let
him
go
at
the
bottom
she
knew
very
well
he
could
not
go
when
she
went
down
to
the
at
the
end
of
the
garden
however
she
felt
something
behind
the
door
so
she
looked
and
there
in
the
dark
lay
the
big
blue
bundle
she
sat
on
a
piece
of
coal
and
laughed
every
time
she
saw
it
so
fat
and
yet
so
ignominious
slunk
into
its
corner
in
the
dark
with
its
ends
flopping
like
dejected
ears
from
the
knots
she
laughed
again
she
was
relieved
morel
sat
waiting
he
had
not
any
money
she
knew
so
if
he
stopped
he
was
running
up
a
bill
she
was
very
tired
of
him
tired
to
death
he
had
not
even
the
courage
to
carry
his
bundle
beyond
the
as
she
meditated
at
about
nine
he
opened
the
door
and
came
in
slinking
and
yet
sulky
she
said
not
a
word
he
took
off
his
coat
and
slunk
to
his
armchair
where
he
began
to
take
off
his
boots
you
better
fetch
your
bundle
before
you
take
your
boots
off
she
said
quietly
you
may
thank
your
stars
i
come
back
he
said
looking
up
from
under
his
dropped
head
sulkily
trying
to
be
impressive
why
where
should
you
have
gone
you
dare
even
get
your
parcel
through
the
she
said
he
looked
such
a
fool
she
was
not
even
angry
with
him
he
continued
to
take
his
boots
off
and
prepare
for
bed
i
do
know
what
in
your
blue
handkerchief
she
said
but
if
you
leave
it
the
children
shall
fetch
it
in
the
whereupon
he
got
up
and
went
out
of
the
house
returning
presently
and
crossing
the
kitchen
with
averted
face
hurrying
upstairs
as
morel
saw
him
slink
quickly
through
the
inner
doorway
holding
his
bundle
she
laughed
to
herself
but
her
heart
was
bitter
because
she
had
loved
him
chapter
iii
the
casting
off
of
morel
the
taking
on
of
william
during
the
next
week
morel
temper
was
almost
unbearable
like
all
miners
he
was
a
great
lover
of
medicines
which
strangely
enough
he
would
often
pay
for
himself
you
mun
get
me
a
drop
o
laxy
vitral
he
said
it
a
winder
as
we
canna
a
sup
i
th
so
morel
bought
him
elixir
of
vitriol
his
favourite
first
medicine
and
he
made
himself
a
jug
of
wormwood
tea
he
had
hanging
in
the
attic
great
bunches
of
dried
herbs
wormwood
rue
horehound
elder
flowers
marshmallow
hyssop
dandelion
and
centaury
usually
there
was
a
jug
of
one
or
other
decoction
standing
on
the
hob
from
which
he
drank
largely
grand
he
said
smacking
his
lips
after
wormwood
grand
and
he
exhorted
the
children
to
try
it
better
than
any
of
your
tea
or
your
cocoa
stews
he
vowed
but
they
were
not
to
be
tempted
this
time
however
neither
pills
nor
vitriol
nor
all
his
herbs
would
shift
the
nasty
peens
in
his
head
he
was
sickening
for
an
attack
of
an
inflammation
of
the
brain
he
had
never
been
well
since
his
sleeping
on
the
ground
when
he
went
with
jerry
to
nottingham
since
then
he
had
drunk
and
stormed
now
he
fell
seriously
ill
and
morel
had
him
to
nurse
he
was
one
of
the
worst
patients
imaginable
but
in
spite
of
all
and
putting
aside
the
fact
that
he
was
breadwinner
she
never
quite
wanted
him
to
die
still
there
was
one
part
of
her
wanted
him
for
herself
the
neighbours
were
very
good
to
her
occasionally
some
had
the
children
in
to
meals
occasionally
some
would
do
the
downstairs
work
for
her
one
would
mind
the
baby
for
a
day
but
it
was
a
great
drag
nevertheless
it
was
not
every
day
the
neighbours
helped
then
she
had
nursing
of
baby
and
husband
cleaning
and
cooking
everything
to
do
she
was
quite
worn
out
but
she
did
what
was
wanted
of
her
and
the
money
was
just
sufficient
she
had
seventeen
shillings
a
week
from
clubs
and
every
friday
barker
and
the
other
butty
put
by
a
portion
of
the
stall
profits
for
morel
wife
and
the
neighbours
made
broths
and
gave
eggs
and
such
invalids
trifles
if
they
had
not
helped
her
so
generously
in
those
times
morel
would
never
have
pulled
through
without
incurring
debts
that
would
have
dragged
her
down
the
weeks
passed
morel
almost
against
hope
grew
better
he
had
a
fine
constitution
so
that
once
on
the
mend
he
went
straight
forward
to
recovery
soon
he
was
pottering
about
downstairs
during
his
illness
his
wife
had
spoilt
him
a
little
now
he
wanted
her
to
continue
he
often
put
his
band
to
his
head
pulled
down
the
corners
of
his
mouth
and
shammed
pains
he
did
not
feel
but
there
was
no
deceiving
her
at
first
she
merely
smiled
to
herself
then
she
scolded
him
sharply
goodness
man
do
be
so
that
wounded
him
slightly
but
still
he
continued
to
feign
sickness
i
would
be
such
a
mardy
baby
said
the
wife
shortly
then
he
was
indignant
and
cursed
under
his
breath
like
a
boy
he
was
forced
to
resume
a
normal
tone
and
to
cease
to
whine
nevertheless
there
was
a
state
of
peace
in
the
house
for
some
time
morel
was
more
tolerant
of
him
and
he
depending
on
her
almost
like
a
child
was
rather
happy
neither
knew
that
she
was
more
tolerant
because
she
loved
him
less
up
till
this
time
in
spite
of
all
he
had
been
her
husband
and
her
man
she
had
felt
that
more
or
less
what
he
did
to
himself
he
did
to
her
her
living
depended
on
him
there
were
many
many
stages
in
the
ebbing
of
her
love
for
him
but
it
was
always
ebbing
now
with
the
birth
of
this
third
baby
her
self
no
longer
set
towards
him
helplessly
but
was
like
a
tide
that
scarcely
rose
standing
off
from
him
after
this
she
scarcely
desired
him
and
standing
more
aloof
from
him
not
feeling
him
so
much
part
of
herself
but
merely
part
of
her
circumstances
she
did
not
mind
so
much
what
he
did
could
leave
him
alone
there
was
the
halt
the
wistfulness
about
the
ensuing
year
which
is
like
autumn
in
a
man
life
his
wife
was
casting
him
off
half
regretfully
but
relentlessly
casting
him
off
and
turning
now
for
love
and
life
to
the
children
henceforward
he
was
more
or
less
a
husk
and
he
himself
acquiesced
as
so
many
men
do
yielding
their
place
to
their
children
during
his
recuperation
when
it
was
really
over
between
them
both
made
an
effort
to
come
back
somewhat
to
the
old
relationship
of
the
first
months
of
their
marriage
he
sat
at
home
and
when
the
children
were
in
bed
and
she
was
sewing
she
did
all
her
sewing
by
hand
made
all
shirts
and
children
clothing
he
would
read
to
her
from
the
newspaper
slowly
pronouncing
and
delivering
the
words
like
a
man
pitching
quoits
often
she
hurried
him
on
giving
him
a
phrase
in
anticipation
and
then
he
took
her
words
humbly
the
silences
between
them
were
peculiar
there
would
be
the
swift
slight
cluck
of
her
needle
the
sharp
pop
of
his
lips
as
he
let
out
the
smoke
the
warmth
the
sizzle
on
the
bars
as
he
spat
in
the
fire
then
her
thoughts
turned
to
william
already
he
was
getting
a
big
boy
already
he
was
top
of
the
class
and
the
master
said
he
was
the
smartest
lad
in
the
school
she
saw
him
a
man
young
full
of
vigour
making
the
world
glow
again
for
her
and
morel
sitting
there
quite
alone
and
having
nothing
to
think
about
would
be
feeling
vaguely
uncomfortable
his
soul
would
reach
out
in
its
blind
way
to
her
and
find
her
gone
he
felt
a
sort
of
emptiness
almost
like
a
vacuum
in
his
soul
he
was
unsettled
and
restless
soon
he
could
not
live
in
that
atmosphere
and
he
affected
his
wife
both
felt
an
oppression
on
their
breathing
when
they
were
left
together
for
some
time
then
he
went
to
bed
and
she
settled
down
to
enjoy
herself
alone
working
thinking
living
meanwhile
another
infant
was
coming
fruit
of
this
little
peace
and
tenderness
between
the
separating
parents
paul
was
seventeen
months
old
when
the
new
baby
was
born
he
was
then
a
plump
pale
child
quiet
with
heavy
blue
eyes
and
still
the
peculiar
slight
knitting
of
the
brows
the
last
child
was
also
a
boy
fair
and
bonny
morel
was
sorry
when
she
knew
she
was
with
child
both
for
economic
reasons
and
because
she
did
not
love
her
husband
but
not
for
the
sake
of
the
infant
they
called
the
baby
arthur
he
was
very
pretty
with
a
mop
of
gold
curls
and
he
loved
his
father
from
the
first
morel
was
glad
this
child
loved
the
father
hearing
the
miner
footsteps
the
baby
would
put
up
his
arms
and
crow
and
if
morel
were
in
a
good
temper
he
called
back
immediately
in
his
hearty
mellow
voice
what
then
my
beauty
i
sh
come
to
thee
in
a
and
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
off
his
morel
would
put
an
apron
round
the
child
and
give
him
to
his
father
what
a
sight
the
lad
looks
she
would
exclaim
sometimes
taking
back
the
baby
that
was
smutted
on
the
face
from
his
father
kisses
and
play
then
morel
laughed
joyfully
he
a
little
collier
bless
his
bit
o
mutton
he
exclaimed
and
these
were
the
happy
moments
of
her
life
now
when
the
children
included
the
father
in
her
heart
meanwhile
william
grew
bigger
and
stronger
and
more
active
while
paul
always
rather
delicate
and
quiet
got
slimmer
and
trotted
after
his
mother
like
her
shadow
he
was
usually
active
and
interested
but
sometimes
he
would
have
fits
of
depression
then
the
mother
would
find
the
boy
of
three
or
four
crying
on
the
sofa
what
the
matter
she
asked
and
got
no
answer
what
the
matter
she
insisted
getting
cross
i
do
know
sobbed
the
child
so
she
tried
to
reason
him
out
of
it
or
to
amuse
him
but
without
effect
it
made
her
feel
beside
herself
then
the
father
always
impatient
would
jump
from
his
chair
and
shout
if
he
does
stop
i
smack
him
till
he
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
said
the
mother
coldly
and
then
she
carried
the
child
into
the
yard
plumped
him
into
his
little
chair
and
said
now
cry
there
misery
and
then
a
butterfly
on
the
perhaps
caught
his
eye
or
at
last
he
cried
himself
to
sleep
these
fits
were
not
often
but
they
caused
a
shadow
in
morel
heart
and
her
treatment
of
paul
was
different
from
that
of
the
other
children
suddenly
one
morning
as
she
was
looking
down
the
alley
of
the
bottoms
for
the
she
heard
a
voice
calling
her
it
was
the
thin
little

after

at
when

on
a

william
fled
away
glad
to
be
exonerated
and
morel
who
hated
any
bother
with
the
neighbours
thought
she
would
explain
to
anthony
and
the
business
would
be
over
but
that
evening
morel
came
in
from
the
pit
looking
very
sour
he
stood
in
the
kitchen
and
glared
round
but
did
not
speak
for
some
minutes
then
wheer
that
willy

asked

repeated
morel
and
he
said
no
more
but
sat
and
nursed
his
bad
temper
suddenly
william
ran
in
saying
can
i
have
my
tea
mother
tha
can
more
than

shouted
morel
hold

noise
man
said
morel
and
do

he
look
ridiculous
before
i
done
wi
him
shouted
morel
rising
from
his
chair
and
glaring
at
his
son
william
who
was
a
tall
lad
for
his
years
but
very
sensitive
had
gone
pale
and
was
looking
in
a
sort
of
horror
at
his
father
go
out
morel
commanded
her
son
william
had
not
the
wit
to
move
suddenly
morel
clenched
his
fist
and
crouched
i
him
out
he
shouted
like
an
insane
thing
what
cried
morel
panting
with
rage
you
shall
not
touch
him
for
her
telling
you
shall
not
shonna
i
shouted
morel
shonna
i
and
glaring
at
the
boy
he
ran
forward
morel
sprang
in
between
them
with
her
fist
lifted
do
you
dare
she
cried
what
he
shouted
baffled
for
the
moment
what
she
spun
round
to
her
son
go
out
of
the
house
she
commanded
him
in
fury
the
boy
as
if
hypnotised
by
her
turned
suddenly
and
was
gone
morel
rushed
to
the
door
but
was
too
late
he
returned
pale
under
his
with
fury
but
now
his
wife
was
fully
roused
only
dare
she
said
in
a
loud
ringing
voice
only
dare
milord
to
lay
a
finger
on
that
child
you
regret
it
for
he
was
afraid
of
her
in
a
towering
rage
he
sat
down
when
the
children
were
old
enough
to
be
left
morel
joined
the
women
guild
it
was
a
little
club
of
women
attached
to
the
wholesale
society
which
met
on
monday
night
in
the
long
room
over
the
grocery
shop
of
the
bestwood
the
women
were
supposed
to
discuss
the
benefits
to
be
derived
from
and
other
social
questions
sometimes
morel
read
a
paper
it
seemed
queer
to
the
children
to
see
their
mother
who
was
always
busy
about
the
house
sitting
writing
in
her
rapid
fashion
thinking
referring
to
books
and
writing
again
they
felt
for
her
on
such
occasions
the
deepest
respect
but
they
loved
the
guild
it
was
the
only
thing
to
which
they
did
not
grudge
their
mother
and
that
partly
because
she
enjoyed
it
partly
because
of
the
treats
they
derived
from
it
the
guild
was
called
by
some
hostile
husbands
who
found
their
wives
getting
too
independent
the
shop
that
is
the
it
is
true
from
off
the
basis
of
the
guild
the
women
could
look
at
their
homes
at
the
conditions
of
their
own
lives
and
find
fault
so
the
colliers
found
their
women
had
a
new
standard
of
their
own
rather
disconcerting
and
also
morel
always
had
a
lot
of
news
on
monday
nights
so
that
the
children
liked
william
to
be
in
when
their
mother
came
home
because
she
told
him
things
then
when
the
lad
was
thirteen
she
got
him
a
job
in
the
office
he
was
a
very
clever
boy
frank
with
rather
rough
features
and
real
viking
blue
eyes
what
dost
want
ter
a
jack
on
for
said
morel
all
he
do
is
to
wear
his
britches
behind
out
an
earn
nowt
startin
wi
it
does
matter
what
he
starting
with
said
morel
it
wouldna

th
pit
we
me
an
earn
a
easy
ten
a
wik
from
th
start
but
six
shillin

a
stool
better
than

shillin
i
th
pit
i
he
is
not
going
in
the
pit
said
morel
and
there
an
end
of
it
wor
good
enough
for
me
but
it
non
good
enough
for
if
your
mother
put
you
in
the
pit
at
twelve
it
no
reason
why
i
should
do
the
same
with
my
twelve
it
wor
a
sight
afore
that
whenever
it
was
said
morel
she
was
very
proud
of
her
son
he
went
to
the
night
school
and
learned
shorthand
so
that
by
the
time
he
was
sixteen
he
was
the
best
shorthand
clerk
and
on
the
place
except
one
then
he
taught
in
the
night
schools
but
he
was
so
fiery
that
only
his
and
his
size
protected
him
all
the
things
that
men
do
the
decent
things
william
did
he
could
run
like
the
wind
when
he
was
twelve
he
won
a
first
prize
in
a
race
an
inkstand
of
glass
shaped
like
an
anvil
it
stood
proudly
on
the
dresser
and
gave
morel
a
keen
pleasure
the
boy
only
ran
for
her
he
flew
home
with
his
anvil
breathless
with
a
look
mother
that
was
the
first
real
tribute
to
herself
she
took
it
like
a
queen
how
pretty
she
exclaimed
then
he
began
to
get
ambitious
he
gave
all
his
money
to
his
mother
when
he
earned
fourteen
shillings
a
week
she
gave
him
back
two
for
himself
and
as
he
never
drank
he
felt
himself
rich
he
went
about
with
the
bourgeois
of
bestwood
the
townlet
contained
nothing
higher
than
the
clergyman
then
came
the
bank
manager
then
the
doctors
then
the
tradespeople
and
after
that
the
hosts
of
colliers
willam
began
to
consort
with
the
sons
of
the
chemist
the
schoolmaster
and
the
tradesmen
he
played
billiards
in
the
mechanics
hall
also
he
danced
this
in
spite
of
his
mother
all
the
life
that
bestwood
offered
he
enjoyed
from
the
down
church
street
to
sports
and
billiards
paul
was
treated
to
dazzling
descriptions
of
all
kinds
of
ladies
most
of
whom
lived
like
cut
blooms
in
william
heart
for
a
brief
fortnight
occasionally
some
flame
would
come
in
pursuit
of
her
errant
swain
morel
would
find
a
strange
girl
at
the
door
and
immediately
she
sniffed
the
air
is
morel
in
the
damsel
would
ask
appealingly
my
husband
is
at
home
morel
replied
i
i
mean
young
morel
repeated
the
maiden
painfully
which
one
there
are
whereupon
much
blushing
and
stammering
from
the
fair
one
i
i
met
morel
at
ripley
she
explained
oh
at
a
dance
i
do
approve
of
the
girls
my
son
meets
at
dances
and
he
is
not
at
then
he
came
home
angry
with
his
mother
for
having
turned
the
girl
away
so
rudely
he
was
a
careless
yet
fellow
who
walked
with
long
strides
sometimes
frowning
often
with
his
cap
pushed
jollily
to
the
back
of
his
head
now
he
came
in
frowning
he
threw
his
cap
on
to
the
sofa
and
took
his
strong
jaw
in
his
hand
and
glared
down
at
his
mother
she
was
small
with
her
hair
taken
straight
back
from
her
forehead
she
had
a
quiet
air
of
authority
and
yet
of
rare
warmth
knowing
her
son
was
angry
she
trembled
inwardly
did
a
lady
call
for
me
yesterday
mother
he
asked
i
do
know
about
a
lady
there
was
a
girl
and
why
did
you
tell
me
because
i
forgot
he
fumed
a
little
a
girl
seemed
a
lady
i
did
look
at
big
brown
eyes
i
did
not
look
and
tell
your
girls
my
son
that
when
they
running
after
you
they
not
to
come
and
ask
your
mother
for
you
tell
them
that
brazen
baggages
you
meet
at
i
sure
she
was
a
nice
and
i
sure
she
there
ended
the
altercation
over
the
dancing
there
was
a
great
strife
between
the
mother
and
the
son
the
grievance
reached
its
height
when
william
said
he
was
going
to
hucknall
torkard
considered
a
low
town
to
a
ball
he
was
to
be
a
highlander
there
was
a
dress
he
could
hire
which
one
of
his
friends
had
had
and
which
fitted
him
perfectly
the
highland
suit
came
home
morel
received
it
coldly
and
would
not
unpack
it
my
suit
come
cried
william
there
a
parcel
in
the
front
he
rushed
in
and
cut
the
string
how
do
you
fancy
your
son
in
this
he
said
enraptured
showing
her
the
suit
you
know
i
do
want
to
fancy
you
in
on
the
evening
of
the
dance
when
he
had
come
home
to
dress
morel
put
on
her
coat
and
bonnet
are
you
going
to
stop
and
see
me
mother
he
asked
no
i
do
want
to
see
you
she
replied
she
was
rather
pale
and
her
face
was
closed
and
hard
she
was
afraid
of
her
son
going
the
same
way
as
his
father
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
his
heart
stood
still
with
anxiety
then
he
caught
sight
of
the
highland
bonnet
with
its
ribbons
he
picked
it
up
gleefully
forgetting
her
she
went
out
when
he
was
nineteen
he
suddenly
left
the
office
and
got
a
situation
in
nottingham
in
his
new
place
he
had
thirty
shillings
a
week
instead
of
eighteen
this
was
indeed
a
rise
his
mother
and
his
father
were
brimmed
up
with
pride
everybody
praised
william
it
seemed
he
was
going
to
get
on
rapidly
morel
hoped
with
his
aid
to
help
her
younger
sons
annie
was
now
studying
to
be
a
teacher
paul
also
very
clever
was
getting
on
well
having
lessons
in
french
and
german
from
his
godfather
the
clergyman
who
was
still
a
friend
to
morel
arthur
a
spoilt
and
very
boy
was
at
the
board
school
but
there
was
talk
of
his
trying
to
get
a
scholarship
for
the
high
school
in
nottingham
william
remained
a
year
at
his
new
post
in
nottingham
he
was
studying
hard
and
growing
serious
something
seemed
to
be
fretting
him
still
he
went
out
to
the
dances
and
the
river
parties
he
did
not
drink
the
children
were
all
rabid
teetotallers
he
came
home
very
late
at
night
and
sat
yet
longer
studying
his
mother
implored
him
to
take
more
care
to
do
one
thing
or
another
dance
if
you
want
to
dance
my
son
but
do
think
you
can
work
in
the
office
and
then
amuse
yourself
and
then
study
on
top
of
all
you
ca
the
human
frame
wo
stand
it
do
one
thing
or
the
other
amuse
yourself
or
learn
latin
but
do
try
to
do
then
he
got
a
place
in
london
at
a
hundred
and
twenty
a
year
this
seemed
a
fabulous
sum
his
mother
doubted
almost
whether
to
rejoice
or
to
grieve
they
want
me
in
lime
street
on
monday
week
mother
he
cried
his
eyes
blazing
as
he
read
the
letter
morel
felt
everything
go
silent
inside
her
he
read
the
letter

and

pounds

year
mater
we
s
all
be
rolling
in
we
shall
my
son
she
answered
sadly
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
she
might
be
more
hurt
at
his
going
away
than
glad
of
his
success
indeed
as
the
days
drew
near
for
his
departure
her
heart
began
to
close
and
grow
dreary
with
despair
she
loved
him
so
much
more
than
that
she
hoped
in
him
so
much
almost
she
lived
by
him
she
liked
to
do
things
for
him
she
liked
to
put
a
cup
for
his
tea
and
to
iron
his
collars
of
which
he
was
so
proud
it
was
a
joy
to
her
to
have
him
proud
of
his
collars
there
was
no
laundry
so
she
used
to
rub
away
at
them
with
her
little
convex
iron
to
polish
them
till
they
shone
from
the
sheer
pressure
of
her
arm
now
she
would
not
do
it
for
him
now
he
was
going
away
she
felt
almost
as
if
he
were
going
as
well
out
of
her
heart
he
did
not
seem
to
leave
her
inhabited
with
himself
that
was
the
grief
and
the
pain
to
her
he
took
nearly
all
himself
away
a
few
days
before
his
departure
he
was
just
twenty
he
burned
his
they
had
hung
on
a
file
at
the
top
of
the
kitchen
cupboard
from
some
of
them
he
had
read
extracts
to
his
mother
some
of
them
she
had
taken
the
trouble
to
read
herself
but
most
were
too
trivial
now
on
the
saturday
morning
he
said
come
on
postle
let
go
through
my
letters
and
you
can
have
the
birds
and
morel
had
done
her
saturday
work
on
the
friday
because
he
was
having
a
last
day
holiday
she
was
making
him
a
rice
cake
which
he
loved
to
take
with
him
he
was
scarcely
conscious
that
she
was
so
miserable
he
took
the
first
letter
off
the
file
it
was
and
had
purple
and
green
thistles
william
sniffed
the
page
nice
scent
and
he
thrust
the
sheet
under
paul
nose
um
said
paul
breathing
in
what
call
it
smell
his
mother
ducked
her
small
fine
nose
down
to
the
paper
i
do
want
to
smell
their
rubbish
she
said
sniffing
this
girl
father
said
william
is
as
rich
as
croesus
he
owns
property
without
end
she
calls
me
lafayette
because
i
know
french
will
see
i
forgiven
you
i
like
her
forgiving
me
told
mother
about
you
this
morning
and
she
will
have
much
pleasure
if
you
come
to
tea
on
sunday
but
she
will
have
to
get
father
consent
also
i
sincerely
hope
he
will
agree
i
will
let
you
know
how
it
transpires
if
however
you
you
know
how
it
what
interrupted
morel
oh
yes
repeated
morel
mockingly
i
thought
she
was
so
well
educated
william
felt
slightly
uncomfortable
and
abandoned
this
maiden
giving
paul
the
corner
with
the
thistles
he
continued
to
read
extracts
from
his
letters
some
of
which
amused
his
mother
some
of
which
saddened
her
and
made
her
anxious
for
him
my
lad
she
said
they
very
wise
they
know
they
only
got
to
flatter
your
vanity
and
you
press
up
to
them
like
a
dog
that
has
its
head
well
they
ca
go
on
scratching
for
ever
he
replied
and
when
they
done
i
trot
but
one
day
you
find
a
string
round
your
neck
that
you
ca
pull
off
she
answered
not
me
i
equal
to
any
of
mater
they
need
flatter
you
flatter
yourself
she
said
quietly
soon
there
was
a
heap
of
twisted
black
pages
all
that
remained
of
the
file
of
scented
letters
except
that
paul
had
thirty
or
forty
pretty
tickets
from
the
corners
of
the
notepaper
swallows
and
and
ivy
sprays
and
william
went
to
london
to
start
a
new
life
chapter
iv
the
young
life
of
paul
paul
would
be
built
like
his
mother
slightly
and
rather
small
his
fair
hair
went
reddish
and
then
dark
brown
his
eyes
were
grey
he
was
a
pale
quiet
child
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
listen
and
with
a
full
dropping
underlip
as
a
rule
he
seemed
old
for
his
years
he
was
so
conscious
of
what
other
people
felt
particularly
his
mother
when
she
fretted
he
understood
and
could
have
no
peace
his
soul
seemed
always
attentive
to
her
as
he
grew
older
he
became
stronger
william
was
too
far
removed
from
him
to
accept
him
as
a
companion
so
the
smaller
boy
belonged
at
first
almost
entirely
to
annie
she
was
a
tomboy
and
a
as
her
mother
called
her
but
she
was
intensely
fond
of
her
second
brother
so
paul
was
towed
round
at
the
heels
of
annie
sharing
her
game
she
raced
wildly
at
lerky
with
the
other
young
of
the
bottoms
and
always
paul
flew
beside
her
living
her
share
of
the
game
having
as
yet
no
part
of
his
own
he
was
quiet
and
not
noticeable
but
his
sister
adored
him
he
always
seemed
to
care
for
things
if
she
wanted
him
to
she
had
a
big
doll
of
which
she
was
fearfully
proud
though
not
so
fond
so
she
laid
the
doll
on
the
sofa
and
covered
it
with
an
antimacassar
to
sleep
then
she
forgot
it
meantime
paul
must
practise
jumping
off
the
sofa
arm
so
he
jumped
crash
into
the
face
of
the
hidden
doll
annie
rushed
up
uttered
a
loud
wail
and
sat
down
to
weep
a
dirge
paul
remained
quite
still
you
could
tell
it
was
there
mother
you
could
tell
it
was
there
he
repeated
over
and
over
so
long
as
annie
wept
for
the
doll
he
sat
helpless
with
misery
her
grief
wore
itself
out
she
forgave
her
brother
he
was
so
much
upset
but
a
day
or
two
afterwards
she
was
shocked
let
make
a
sacrifice
of
arabella
he
said
let
burn
she
was
horrified
yet
rather
fascinated
she
wanted
to
see
what
the
boy
would
do
he
made
an
altar
of
bricks
pulled
some
of
the
shavings
out
of
arabella
body
put
the
waxen
fragments
into
the
hollow
face
poured
on
a
little
paraffin
and
set
the
whole
thing
alight
he
watched
with
wicked
satisfaction
the
drops
of
wax
melt
off
the
broken
forehead
of
arabella
and
drop
like
sweat
into
the
flame
so
long
as
the
stupid
big
doll
burned
he
rejoiced
in
silence
at
the
end
be
poked
among
the
embers
with
a
stick
fished
out
the
arms
and
legs
all
blackened
and
smashed
them
under
stones
that
the
sacrifice
of
missis
arabella
he
said
an
i
glad
there
nothing
left
of
which
disturbed
annie
inwardly
although
she
could
say
nothing
he
seemed
to
hate
the
doll
so
intensely
because
he
had
broken
it
all
the
children
but
particularly
paul
were
peculiarly
against
their
father
along
with
their
mother
morel
continued
to
bully
and
to
drink
he
had
periods
months
at
a
time
when
he
made
the
whole
life
of
the
family
a
misery
paul
never
forgot
coming
home
from
the
band
of
hope
one
monday
evening
and
finding
his
mother
with
her
eye
swollen
and
discoloured
his
father
standing
on
the
hearthrug
feet
astride
his
head
down
and
william
just
home
from
work
glaring
at
his
father
there
was
a
silence
as
the
young
children
entered
but
none
of
the
elders
looked
round
william
was
white
to
the
lips
and
his
fists
were
clenched
he
waited
until
the
children
were
silent
watching
with
children
rage
and
hate
then
he
said
you
coward
you
dare
do
it
when
i
was
but
morel
blood
was
up
he
swung
round
on
his
son
william
was
bigger
but
morel
was
and
mad
with
fury
doss
i
he
shouted
doss
i
much
more
o
thy
chelp
my
young
jockey
an
i
rattle
my
fist
about
thee
ay
an
i
sholl
that
dost
see
morel
crouched
at
the
knees
and
showed
his
fist
in
an
ugly
almost
fashion
william
was
white
with
rage
will
yer
he
said
quiet
and
intense
it
be
the
last
time
morel
danced
a
little
nearer
crouching
drawing
back
his
fist
to
strike
william
put
his
fists
ready
a
light
came
into
his
blue
eyes
almost
like
a
laugh
he
watched
his
father
another
word
and
the
men
would
have
begun
to
fight
paul
hoped
they
would
the
three
children
sat
pale
on
the
sofa
stop
it
both
of
you
cried
morel
in
a
hard
voice
we
had
enough
for
one
night
and
you
she
said
turning
on
to
her
husband
look
at
your
children
morel
glanced
at
the
sofa
look
at
the
children
you
nasty
little
bitch
he
sneered
why
what
have
i
done
to
the
children
i
should
like
to
know
but
they
like
yourself
you
put
up
to
your
own
tricks
and
nasty
ways
learned
in
it
you
she
refused
to
answer
him
no
one
spoke
after
a
while
he
threw
his
boots
under
the
table
and
went
to
bed
why
did
you
let
me
have
a
go
at
him
said
william
when
his
father
was
upstairs
i
could
easily
have
beaten
a
nice
thing
your
own
father
she
replied
repeated
william
call
him
my
father
well
he
is
and
so
but
why
do
you
let
me
settle
him
i
could
do
the
idea
she
cried
it
has
come
to
that
no
he
said
it
come
to
worse
look
at
yourself
why
did
you
let
me
give
it
him
because
i
could
bear
it
so
never
think
of
it
she
cried
quickly
and
the
children
went
to
bed
miserably
when
william
was
growing
up
the
family
moved
from
the
bottoms
to
a
house
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
commanding
a
view
of
the
valley
which
spread
out
like
a
convex
or
a
before
it
in
front
of
the
house
was
a
huge
old
the
west
wind
sweeping
from
derbyshire
caught
the
houses
with
full
force
and
the
tree
shrieked
again
morel
liked
it
it
music
he
said
it
sends
me
to
but
paul
and
arthur
and
annie
hated
it
to
paul
it
became
almost
a
demoniacal
noise
the
winter
of
their
first
year
in
the
new
house
their
father
was
very
bad
the
children
played
in
the
street
on
the
brim
of
the
wide
dark
valley
until
eight
then
they
went
to
bed
their
mother
sat
sewing
below
having
such
a
great
space
in
front
of
the
house
gave
the
children
a
feeling
of
night
of
vastness
and
of
terror
this
terror
came
in
from
the
shrieking
of
the
tree
and
the
anguish
of
the
home
discord
often
paul
would
wake
up
after
he
had
been
asleep
a
long
time
aware
of
thuds
downstairs
instantly
he
was
wide
awake
then
he
heard
the
booming
shouts
of
his
father
come
home
nearly
drunk
then
the
sharp
replies
of
his
mother
then
the
bang
bang
of
his
father
fist
on
the
table
and
the
nasty
snarling
shout
as
the
man
voice
got
higher
and
then
the
whole
was
drowned
in
a
piercing
medley
of
shrieks
and
cries
from
the
great
the
children
lay
silent
in
suspense
waiting
for
a
lull
in
the
wind
to
hear
what
their
father
was
doing
he
might
hit
their
mother
again
there
was
a
feeling
of
horror
a
kind
of
bristling
in
the
darkness
and
a
sense
of
blood
they
lay
with
their
hearts
in
the
grip
of
an
intense
anguish
the
wind
came
through
the
tree
fiercer
and
fiercer
all
the
chords
of
the
great
harp
hummed
whistled
and
shrieked
and
then
came
the
horror
of
the
sudden
silence
silence
everywhere
outside
and
downstairs
what
was
it
was
it
a
silence
of
blood
what
had
he
done
the
children
lay
and
breathed
the
darkness
and
then
at
last
they
heard
their
father
throw
down
his
boots
and
tramp
upstairs
in
his
stockinged
feet
still
they
listened
then
at
last
if
the
wind
allowed
they
heard
the
water
of
the
tap
drumming
into
the
kettle
which
their
mother
was
filling
for
morning
and
they
could
go
to
sleep
in
peace
so
they
were
happy
in
the
morning
happy
very
happy
playing
dancing
at
night
round
the
lonely
in
the
midst
of
the
darkness
but
they
had
one
tight
place
of
anxiety
in
their
hearts
one
darkness
in
their
eyes
which
showed
all
their
lives
paul
hated
his
father
as
a
boy
he
had
a
fervent
private
religion
make
him
stop
drinking
he
prayed
every
night
lord
let
my
father
die
he
prayed
very
often
let
him
not
be
killed
at
pit
he
prayed
when
after
tea
the
father
did
not
come
home
from
work
that
was
another
time
when
the
family
suffered
intensely
the
children
came
from
school
and
had
their
teas
on
the
hob
the
big
black
saucepan
was
simmering
the
was
in
the
oven
ready
for
morel
dinner
he
was
expected
at
five
but
for
months
he
would
stop
and
drink
every
night
on
his
way
from
work
in
the
winter
nights
when
it
was
cold
and
grew
dark
early
morel
would
put
a
brass
candlestick
on
the
table
light
a
tallow
candle
to
save
the
gas
the
children
finished
their
or
dripping
and
were
ready
to
go
out
to
play
but
if
morel
had
not
come
they
faltered
the
sense
of
his
sitting
in
all
his
drinking
after
a
long
day
work
not
coming
home
and
eating
and
washing
but
sitting
getting
drunk
on
an
empty
stomach
made
morel
unable
to
bear
herself
from
her
the
feeling
was
transmitted
to
the
other
children
she
never
suffered
alone
any
more
the
children
suffered
with
her
paul
went
out
to
play
with
the
rest
down
in
the
great
trough
of
twilight
tiny
clusters
of
lights
burned
where
the
pits
were
a
few
last
colliers
straggled
up
the
dim
field
path
the
lamplighter
came
along
no
more
colliers
came
darkness
shut
down
over
the
valley
work
was
done
it
was
night
then
paul
ran
anxiously
into
the
kitchen
the
one
candle
still
burned
on
the
table
the
big
fire
glowed
red
morel
sat
alone
on
the
hob
the
saucepan
steamed
the
lay
waiting
on
the
table
all
the
room
was
full
of
the
sense
of
waiting
waiting
for
the
man
who
was
sitting
in
his
dinnerless
some
mile
away
from
home
across
the
darkness
drinking
himself
drunk
paul
stood
in
the
doorway
has
my
dad
come
he
asked
you
can
see
he
has
said
morel
cross
with
the
futility
of
the
question
then
the
boy
dawdled
about
near
his
mother
they
shared
the
same
anxiety
presently
morel
went
out
and
strained
the
potatoes
they
ruined
and
black
she
said
but
what
do
i
care
not
many
words
were
spoken
paul
almost
hated
his
mother
for
suffering
because
his
father
did
not
come
home
from
work
what
do
you
bother
yourself
for
he
said
if
he
wants
to
stop
and
get
drunk
why
do
you
let
him
let
him
flashed
morel
you
may
well
say
she
knew
that
the
man
who
stops
on
the
way
home
from
work
is
on
a
quick
way
to
ruining
himself
and
his
home
the
children
were
yet
young
and
depended
on
the
breadwinner
william
gave
her
the
sense
of
relief
providing
her
at
last
with
someone
to
turn
to
if
morel
failed
but
the
tense
atmosphere
of
the
room
on
these
waiting
evenings
was
the
same
the
minutes
ticked
away
at
six
still
the
cloth
lay
on
the
table
still
the
dinner
stood
waiting
still
the
same
sense
of
anxiety
and
expectation
in
the
room
the
boy
could
not
stand
it
any
longer
he
could
not
go
out
and
play
so
he
ran
in
to
inger
next
door
but
one
for
her
to
talk
to
him
she
had
no
children
her
husband
was
good
to
her
but
was
in
a
shop
and
came
home
late
so
when
she
saw
the
lad
at
the
door
she
called
come
in
the
two
sat
talking
for
some
time
when
suddenly
the
boy
rose
saying
well
i
be
going
and
seeing
if
my
mother
wants
an
errand
he
pretended
to
be
perfectly
cheerful
and
did
not
tell
his
friend
what
ailed
him
then
he
ran
indoors
morel
at
these
times
came
in
churlish
and
hateful
this
is
a
nice
time
to
come
home
said
morel
wha
it
matter
to
yo
what
time
i
come
whoam
he
shouted
and
everybody
in
the
house
was
still
because
he
was
dangerous
he
ate
his
food
in
the
most
brutal
manner
possible
and
when
he
had
done
pushed
all
the
pots
in
a
heap
away
from
him
to
lay
his
arms
on
the
table
then
he
went
to
sleep
paul
hated
his
father
so
the
collier
small
mean
head
with
its
black
hair
slightly
soiled
with
grey
lay
on
the
bare
arms
and
the
face
dirty
and
inflamed
with
a
fleshy
nose
and
thin
paltry
brows
was
turned
sideways
asleep
with
beer
and
weariness
and
nasty
temper
if
anyone
entered
suddenly
or
a
noise
were
made
the
man
looked
up
and
shouted
i
lay
my
fist
about
thy
i
tellin
thee
if
tha
doesna
stop
that
clatter
dost
hear
and
the
two
last
words
shouted
in
a
bullying
fashion
usually
at
annie
made
the
family
writhe
with
hate
of
the
man
he
was
shut
out
from
all
family
affairs
no
one
told
him
anything
the
children
alone
with
their
mother
told
her
all
about
the
happenings
everything
nothing
had
really
taken
place
in
them
until
it
was
told
to
their
mother
but
as
soon
as
the
father
came
in
everything
stopped
he
was
like
the
scotch
in
the
smooth
happy
machinery
of
the
home
and
he
was
always
aware
of
this
fall
of
silence
on
his
entry
the
shutting
off
of
life
the
unwelcome
but
now
it
was
gone
too
far
to
alter
he
would
dearly
have
liked
the
children
to
talk
to
him
but
they
could
not
sometimes
morel
would
say
you
ought
to
tell
your
paul
won
a
prize
in
a
competition
in
a
child
paper
everybody
was
highly
jubilant
now
you
better
tell
your
father
when
he
comes
in
said
morel
you
know
how
be
carries
on
and
says
he
never
told
all
right
said
paul
but
he
would
almost
rather
have
forfeited
the
prize
than
have
to
tell
his
father
i
won
a
prize
in
a
competition
dad
he
said
morel
turned
round
to
him
have
you
my
boy
what
sort
of
a
competition
oh
nothing
about
famous
and
how
much
is
the
prize
then
as
you
got
it
a
oh
indeed
about
hm
hm
and
that
was
all
conversation
was
impossible
between
the
father
and
any
other
member
of
the
family
he
was
an
outsider
he
had
denied
the
god
in
him
the
only
times
when
he
entered
again
into
the
life
of
his
own
people
was
when
he
worked
and
was
happy
at
work
sometimes
in
the
evening
he
cobbled
the
boots
or
mended
the
kettle
or
his
then
he
always
wanted
several
attendants
and
the
children
enjoyed
it
they
united
with
him
in
the
work
in
the
actual
doing
of
something
when
he
was
his
real
self
again
he
was
a
good
workman
dexterous
and
one
who
when
he
was
in
a
good
humour
always
sang
he
had
whole
periods
months
almost
years
of
friction
and
nasty
temper
then
sometimes
he
was
jolly
again
it
was
nice
to
see
him
run
with
a
piece
of
iron
into
the
scullery
crying
out
of
my
road
out
of
my
road
then
he
hammered
the
soft
stuff
on
his
iron
goose
and
made
the
shape
he
wanted
or
he
sat
absorbed
for
a
moment
soldering
then
the
children
watched
with
joy
as
the
metal
sank
suddenly
molten
and
was
shoved
about
against
the
nose
of
the
while
the
room
was
full
of
a
scent
of
burnt
resin
and
hot
tin
and
morel
was
silent
and
intent
for
a
minute
he
always
sang
when
he
mended
boots
because
of
the
jolly
sound
of
hammering
and
he
was
rather
happy
when
he
sat
putting
great
patches
on
his
moleskin
pit
trousers
which
he
would
often
do
considering
them
too
dirty
and
the
stuff
too
hard
for
his
wife
to
mend
but
the
best
time
for
the
young
children
was
when
he
made
fuses
morel
fetched
a
sheaf
of
long
sound
from
the
attic
these
he
cleaned
with
his
hand
till
each
one
gleamed
like
a
stalk
of
gold
after
which
he
cut
the
straws
into
lengths
of
about
six
inches
leaving
if
he
could
a
notch
at
the
bottom
of
each
piece
he
always
had
a
beautifully
sharp
knife
that
could
cut
a
straw
clean
without
hurting
it
then
he
set
in
the
middle
of
the
table
a
heap
of
gunpowder
a
little
pile
of
black
grains
upon
the
board
he
made
and
trimmed
the
straws
while
paul
and
annie
rifled
and
plugged
them
paul
loved
to
see
the
black
grains
trickle
down
a
crack
in
his
palm
into
the
mouth
of
the
straw
peppering
jollily
downwards
till
the
straw
was
full
then
he
bunged
up
the
mouth
with
a
bit
of
soap
which
he
got
on
his
from
a
pat
in
a
saucer
and
the
straw
was
finished
look
dad
he
said
that
right
my
beauty
replied
morel
who
was
peculiarly
lavish
of
endearments
to
his
second
son
paul
popped
the
fuse
into
the
ready
for
the
morning
when
morel
would
take
it
to
the
pit
and
use
it
to
fire
a
shot
that
would
blast
the
coal
down
meantime
arthur
still
fond
of
his
father
would
lean
on
the
arm
of
morel
chair
and
say
tell
us
about
down
pit
this
morel
loved
to
do
well
there
one
little
we
call
taffy
he
would
begin
he
a
fawce
morel
had
a
warm
way
of
telling
a
story
he
made
one
feel
cunning
he
a
brown
he
would
answer
an
not
very
high
well
he
comes
i
th
stall
wi
a
rattle
an
then
yo
sneeze
taff
you
say
art
sneezin
for
bin
some
snuff
an
sneezes
again
then
he
slives
up
an
shoves
on
yer
that
cadin
want
taff
yo
and
what
does
he
arthur
always
asked
he
wants
a
bit
o
bacca
my
this
story
of
taffy
would
go
on
interminably
and
everybody
loved
it
or
sometimes
it
was
a
new
tale
an
what
dost
think
my
darlin
when
i
went
to
put
my
coat
on
at
what
should
go
runnin
up
my
arm
but
a
mouse
up
theer
i
shouts
an
i
wor
just
in
time
ter
get
by
th
and
did
you
kill
it
i
did
for
they
a
nuisance
the
place
is
fair
snied
wi
an
what
do
they
live
on
the
corn
as
the
drops
an
they
get
in
your
pocket
an
eat
your
snap
if
you
let
no
matter
where
yo
hing
your
coat
the
slivin
nibblin
little
nuisances
for
they
these
happy
evenings
could
not
take
place
unless
morel
had
some
job
to
do
and
then
he
always
went
to
bed
very
early
often
before
the
children
there
was
nothing
remaining
for
him
to
stay
up
for
when
he
had
finished
tinkering
and
had
skimmed
the
headlines
of
the
newspaper
and
the
children
felt
secure
when
their
father
was
in
bed
they
lay
and
talked
softly
a
while
then
they
started
as
the
lights
went
suddenly
sprawling
over
the
ceiling
from
the
lamps
that
swung
in
the
hands
of
the
colliers
tramping
by
outside
going
to
take
the
nine
shift
they
listened
to
the
voices
of
the
men
imagined
them
dipping
down
into
the
dark
valley
sometimes
they
went
to
the
window
and
watched
the
three
or
four
lamps
growing
tinier
and
tinier
swaying
down
the
fields
in
the
darkness
then
it
was
a
joy
to
rush
back
to
bed
and
cuddle
closely
in
the
warmth
paul
was
rather
a
delicate
boy
subject
to
bronchitis
the
others
were
all
quite
strong
so
this
was
another
reason
for
his
mother
difference
in
feeling
for
him
one
day
he
came
home
at
feeling
ill
but
it
was
not
a
family
to
make
any
fuss
what
the
matter
with
you
his
mother
asked
sharply
nothing
he
replied
but
he
ate
no
dinner
if
you
eat
no
dinner
you
not
going
to
school
she
said
why
he
asked
that
so
after
dinner
he
lay
down
on
the
sofa
on
the
warm
chintz
cushions
the
children
loved
then
he
fell
into
a
kind
of
doze
that
afternoon
morel
was
ironing
she
listened
to
the
small
restless
noise
the
boy
made
in
his
throat
as
she
worked
again
rose
in
her
heart
the
old
almost
weary
feeling
towards
him
she
had
never
expected
him
to
live
and
yet
he
had
a
great
vitality
in
his
young
body
perhaps
it
would
have
been
a
little
relief
to
her
if
he
had
died
she
always
felt
a
mixture
of
anguish
in
her
love
for
him
he
in
his
sleep
was
vaguely
aware
of
the
clatter
of
the
iron
on
the
of
the
faint
thud
thud
on
the
once
roused
he
opened
his
eyes
to
see
his
mother
standing
on
the
hearthrug
with
the
hot
iron
near
her
cheek
listening
as
it
were
to
the
heat
her
still
face
with
the
mouth
closed
tight
from
suffering
and
disillusion
and
and
her
nose
the
smallest
bit
on
one
side
and
her
blue
eyes
so
young
quick
and
warm
made
his
heart
contract
with
love
when
she
was
quiet
so
she
looked
brave
and
rich
with
life
but
as
if
she
had
been
done
out
of
her
rights
it
hurt
the
boy
keenly
this
feeling
about
her
that
she
had
never
had
her
life
fulfilment
and
his
own
incapability
to
make
up
to
her
hurt
him
with
a
sense
of
impotence
yet
made
him
patiently
dogged
inside
it
was
his
childish
aim
she
spat
on
the
iron
and
a
little
ball
of
spit
bounded
raced
off
the
dark
glossy
surface
then
kneeling
she
rubbed
the
iron
on
the
sack
lining
of
the
hearthrug
vigorously
she
was
warm
in
the
ruddy
firelight
paul
loved
the
way
she
crouched
and
put
her
head
on
one
side
her
movements
were
light
and
quick
it
was
always
a
pleasure
to
watch
her
nothing
she
ever
did
no
movement
she
ever
made
could
have
been
found
fault
with
by
her
children
the
room
was
warm
and
full
of
the
scent
of
hot
linen
later
on
the
clergyman
came
and
talked
softly
with
her
paul
was
laid
up
with
an
attack
of
bronchitis
he
did
not
mind
much
what
happened
happened
and
it
was
no
good
kicking
against
the
pricks
he
loved
the
evenings
after
eight
when
the
light
was
put
out
and
he
could
watch
the
spring
over
the
darkness
of
the
walls
and
ceiling
could
watch
huge
shadows
waving
and
tossing
till
the
room
seemed
full
of
men
who
battled
silently
on
retiring
to
bed
the
father
would
come
into
the
sickroom
he
was
always
very
gentle
if
anyone
were
ill
but
he
disturbed
the
atmosphere
for
the
boy
are
ter
asleep
my
darlin
morel
asked
softly
no
is
my
mother
comin
she
just
finishin
foldin
the
clothes
do
you
want
anything
morel
rarely
thee
his
son
i
do
want
nothing
but
how
long
will
she
be
not
long
my
the
father
waited
undecidedly
on
the
hearthrug
for
a
moment
or
two
he
felt
his
son
did
not
want
him
then
he
went
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
said
to
his
wife
this
childt
axin
for
thee
how
long
art
goin
to
be
until
i
finished
good
gracious
tell
him
to
go
to
she
says
you
to
go
to
sleep
the
father
repeated
gently
to
paul
well
i
want
her
to
come
insisted
the
boy
he
says
he
ca
go
off
till
you
come
morel
called
downstairs
eh
dear
i
sha
be
long
and
do
stop
shouting
downstairs
the
other
children
then
morel
came
again
and
crouched
before
the
bedroom
fire
he
loved
a
fire
dearly
she
says
she
wo
be
long
he
said
he
loitered
about
indefinitely
the
boy
began
to
get
feverish
with
irritation
his
father
presence
seemed
to
aggravate
all
his
sick
impatience
at
last
morel
after
having
stood
looking
at
his
son
awhile
said
softly
my
paul
replied
turning
round
in
relief
to
be
alone
paul
loved
to
sleep
with
his
mother
sleep
is
still
most
perfect
in
spite
of
hygienists
when
it
is
shared
with
a
beloved
the
warmth
the
security
and
peace
of
soul
the
utter
comfort
from
the
touch
of
the
other
knits
the
sleep
so
that
it
takes
the
body
and
soul
completely
in
its
healing
paul
lay
against
her
and
slept
and
got
better
whilst
she
always
a
bad
sleeper
fell
later
on
into
a
profound
sleep
that
seemed
to
give
her
faith
in
convalescence
he
would
sit
up
in
bed
see
the
fluffy
horses
feeding
at
the
troughs
in
the
field
scattering
their
hay
on
the
trodden
yellow
snow
watch
the
miners
troop
home
small
black
figures
trailing
slowly
in
gangs
across
the
white
field
then
the
night
came
up
in
dark
blue
vapour
from
the
snow
in
convalescence
everything
was
wonderful
the
snowflakes
suddenly
arriving
on
the
clung
there
a
moment
like
swallows
then
were
gone
and
a
drop
of
water
was
crawling
down
the
glass
the
snowflakes
whirled
round
the
corner
of
the
house
like
pigeons
dashing
by
away
across
the
valley
the
little
black
train
crawled
doubtfully
over
the
great
whiteness
while
they
were
so
poor
the
children
were
delighted
if
they
could
do
anything
to
help
economically
annie
and
paul
and
arthur
went
out
early
in
the
morning
in
summer
looking
for
mushrooms
hunting
through
the
wet
grass
from
which
the
larks
were
rising
for
the
wonderful
naked
bodies
crouched
secretly
in
the
green
and
if
they
got
half
a
pound
they
felt
exceedingly
happy
there
was
the
joy
of
finding
something
the
joy
of
accepting
something
straight
from
the
hand
of
nature
and
the
joy
of
contributing
to
the
family
exchequer
but
the
most
important
harvest
after
gleaning
for
frumenty
was
the
blackberries
morel
must
buy
fruit
for
puddings
on
the
saturdays
also
she
liked
blackberries
so
paul
and
arthur
scoured
the
coppices
and
woods
and
old
quarries
so
long
as
a
blackberry
was
to
be
found
every
going
on
their
search
in
that
region
of
mining
villages
blackberries
became
a
comparative
rarity
but
paul
hunted
far
and
wide
he
loved
being
out
in
the
country
among
the
bushes
but
he
also
could
not
bear
to
go
home
to
his
mother
empty
that
he
felt
would
disappoint
her
and
he
would
have
died
rather
good
gracious
she
would
exclaim
as
the
lads
came
in
late
and
tired
to
death
and
hungry
wherever
have
you
been
well
replied
paul
there
was
any
so
we
went
over
misk
hills
and
look
here
our
mother
she
peeped
into
the
basket
now
those
are
fine
ones
she
exclaimed
and
there
over
two
pounds
is
there
over
two
pounds
she
tried
the
basket
yes
she
answered
doubtfully
then
paul
fished
out
a
little
spray
he
always
brought
her
one
spray
the
best
he
could
find
pretty
she
said
in
a
curious
tone
of
a
woman
accepting
a
the
boy
walked
all
day
went
miles
and
miles
rather
than
own
himself
beaten
and
come
home
to
her
she
never
realised
this
whilst
he
was
young
she
was
a
woman
who
waited
for
her
children
to
grow
up
and
william
occupied
her
chiefly
but
when
william
went
to
nottingham
and
was
not
so
much
at
home
the
mother
made
a
companion
of
paul
the
latter
was
unconsciously
jealous
of
his
brother
and
william
was
jealous
of
him
at
the
same
time
they
were
good
friends
morel
intimacy
with
her
second
son
was
more
subtle
and
fine
perhaps
not
so
passionate
as
with
her
eldest
it
was
the
rule
that
paul
should
fetch
the
money
on
friday
afternoons
the
colliers
of
the
five
pits
were
paid
on
fridays
but
not
individually
all
the
earnings
of
each
stall
were
put
down
to
the
chief
butty
as
contractor
and
he
divided
the
wages
again
either
in
the
or
in
his
own
home
so
that
the
children
could
fetch
the
money
school
closed
early
on
friday
afternoons
each
of
the
morel
children
william
then
annie
then
paul
had
fetched
the
money
on
friday
afternoons
until
they
went
themselves
to
work
paul
used
to
set
off
at
three
with
a
little
calico
bag
in
his
pocket
down
all
the
paths
women
girls
children
and
men
were
seen
trooping
to
the
offices
these
offices
were
quite
handsome
a
new
building
almost
like
a
mansion
standing
in
its
own
grounds
at
the
end
of
greenhill
lane
the
was
the
hall
a
long
bare
room
paved
with
blue
brick
and
having
a
seat
all
round
against
the
wall
here
sat
the
colliers
in
their
they
had
come
up
early
the
women
and
children
usually
loitered
about
on
the
red
gravel
paths
paul
always
examined
the
grass
border
and
the
big
grass
bank
because
in
it
grew
tiny
pansies
and
tiny
there
was
a
sound
of
many
voices
the
women
had
on
their
sunday
hats
the
girls
chattered
loudly
little
dogs
ran
here
and
there
the
green
shrubs
were
silent
all
around
then
from
inside
came
the
cry
spinney
park
spinney
all
the
folk
for
spinney
park
trooped
inside
when
it
was
time
for
bretty
to
be
paid
paul
went
in
among
the
crowd
the
was
quite
small
a
counter
went
across
dividing
it
into
half
behind
the
counter
stood
two
men
braithwaite
and
his
clerk
winterbottom
braithwaite
was
large
somewhat
of
the
stern
patriarch
in
appearance
having
a
rather
thin
white
beard
he
was
usually
muffled
in
an
enormous
silk
neckerchief
and
right
up
to
the
hot
summer
a
huge
fire
burned
in
the
open
grate
no
window
was
open
sometimes
in
winter
the
air
scorched
the
throats
of
the
people
coming
in
from
the
freshness
winterbottom
was
rather
small
and
fat
and
very
bald
he
made
remarks
that
were
not
witty
whilst
his
chief
launched
forth
patriarchal
admonitions
against
the
colliers
the
room
was
crowded
with
miners
in
their
men
who
had
been
home
and
changed
and
women
and
one
or
two
children
and
usually
a
dog
paul
was
quite
small
so
it
was
often
his
fate
to
be
jammed
behind
the
legs
of
the
men
near
the
fire
which
scorched
him
he
knew
the
order
of
the
names
they
went
according
to
stall
number
holliday
came
the
ringing
voice
of
braithwaite
then
holliday
stepped
silently
forward
was
paid
drew
aside
bower
john
a
boy
stepped
to
the
counter
braithwaite
large
and
irascible
glowered
at
him
over
his
spectacles
john
bower
he
repeated
it
me
said
the
boy
why
you
used
to
a
different
nose
than
that
said
glossy
winterbottom
peering
over
the
counter
the
people
tittered
thinking
of
john
bower
senior
how
is
it
your
father
not
come
said
braithwaite
in
a
large
and
magisterial
voice
he
badly
piped
the
boy
you
should
tell
him
to
keep
off
the
drink
pronounced
the
great
cashier
an
niver
mind
if
he
puts
his
foot
through
yer
said
a
mocking
voice
from
behind
all
the
men
laughed
the
large
and
important
cashier
looked
down
at
his
next
sheet
fred
pilkington
he
called
quite
indifferent
braithwaite
was
an
important
shareholder
in
the
firm
paul
knew
his
turn
was
next
but
one
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
he
was
pushed
against
the
his
calves
were
burning
but
he
did
not
hope
to
get
through
the
wall
of
men
walter
morel
came
the
ringing
voice
here
piped
paul
small
and
inadequate
morel
walter
morel
the
cashier
repeated
his
finger
and
thumb
on
the
invoice
ready
to
pass
on
paul
was
suffering
convulsions
of
and
could
not
or
would
not
shout
the
backs
of
the
men
obliterated
him
then
winterbottom
came
to
the
rescue
he
here
where
is
he
morel
lad
the
fat
red
bald
little
man
peered
round
with
keen
eyes
he
pointed
at
the
fireplace
the
colliers
looked
round
moved
aside
and
disclosed
the
boy
here
he
is
said
winterbottom
paul
went
to
the
counter
seventeen
pounds
eleven
and
fivepence
why
do
you
shout
up
when
you
called
said
braithwaite
he
banged
on
to
the
invoice
a
bag
of
silver
then
in
a
delicate
and
pretty
movement
picked
up
a
little
column
of
gold
and
plumped
it
beside
the
silver
the
gold
slid
in
a
bright
stream
over
the
paper
the
cashier
finished
counting
off
the
money
the
boy
dragged
the
whole
down
the
counter
to
winterbottom
to
whom
the
stoppages
for
rent
and
tools
must
be
paid
here
he
suffered
again
sixteen
an
six
said
winterbottom
the
lad
was
too
much
upset
to
count
he
pushed
forward
some
loose
silver
and
half
a
sovereign
how
much
do
you
think
you
given
me
asked
winterbottom
the
boy
looked
at
him
but
said
nothing
he
had
not
the
faintest
notion
have
you
got
a
tongue
in
your
head
paul
bit
his
lip
and
pushed
forward
some
more
silver
do
they
teach
you
to
count
at
the
he
asked
nowt
but
algibbra
an
french
said
a
collier
an
cheek
an
impidence
said
another
paul
was
keeping
someone
waiting
with
trembling
fingers
he
got
his
money
into
the
bag
and
slid
out
he
suffered
the
tortures
of
the
damned
on
these
occasions
his
relief
when
he
got
outside
and
was
walking
along
the
mansfield
road
was
infinite
on
the
park
wall
the
mosses
were
green
there
were
some
gold
and
some
white
fowls
pecking
under
the
apple
trees
of
an
orchard
the
colliers
were
walking
home
in
a
stream
the
boy
went
near
the
wall
he
knew
many
of
the
men
but
could
not
recognise
them
in
their
dirt
and
this
was
a
new
torture
to
him
when
he
got
down
to
the
new
inn
at
bretty
his
father
was
not
yet
come
wharmby
the
landlady
knew
him
his
grandmother
morel
mother
had
been
wharmby
friend
your
father
not
come
yet
said
the
landlady
in
the
peculiar
voice
of
a
woman
who
talks
chiefly
to
grown
men
sit
you
paul
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bench
in
the
bar
some
colliers
were
reckoning
sharing
out
their
money
in
a
corner
others
came
in
they
all
glanced
at
the
boy
without
speaking
at
last
morel
came
brisk
and
with
something
of
an
air
even
in
his
blackness
hello
he
said
rather
tenderly
to
his
son
have
you
bested
me
shall
you
have
a
drink
of
something
paul
and
all
the
children
were
bred
up
fierce
and
he
would
have
suffered
more
in
drinking
a
lemonade
before
all
the
men
than
in
having
a
tooth
drawn
the
landlady
looked
at
him
haut
en
rather
pitying
and
at
the
same
time
resenting
his
clear
fierce
morality
paul
went
home
glowering
he
entered
the
house
silently
friday
was
baking
day
and
there
was
usually
a
hot
bun
his
mother
put
it
before
him
suddenly
he
turned
on
her
in
a
fury
his
eyes
flashing
i
not
going
to
the
office
any
more
he
said
why
what
the
matter
his
mother
asked
in
surprise
his
sudden
rages
rather
amused
her
i
not
going
any
more
he
declared
oh
very
well
tell
your
father
he
chewed
his
bun
as
if
he
hated
it
i
not
i
not
going
to
fetch
the
then
one
of
carlin
children
can
go
they
be
glad
enough
of
the
sixpence
said
morel
this
sixpence
was
paul
only
income
it
mostly
went
in
buying
birthday
presents
but
it
was
an
income
and
he
treasured
it
but
they
can
have
it
then
he
said
i
do
want
oh
very
well
said
his
mother
but
you
need
bully
me
about
they
hateful
and
common
and
hateful
they
are
and
i
not
going
any
more
braithwaite
drops
his
an
winterbottom
says
and
is
that
why
you
wo
go
any
more
smiled
morel
the
boy
was
silent
for
some
time
his
face
was
pale
his
eyes
dark
and
furious
his
mother
moved
about
at
her
work
taking
no
notice
of
him
they
always
stan
in
front
of
me
so
i
ca
get
out
he
said
well
my
lad
you
only
to
ask
them
she
replied
an
then
alfred
winterbottom
says
do
they
teach
you
at
the
they
never
taught
him
much
said
morel
that
is
a
fact
neither
manners
nor
wit
and
his
cunning
he
was
born
so
in
her
own
way
she
soothed
him
his
ridiculous
hypersensitiveness
made
her
heart
ache
and
sometimes
the
fury
in
his
eyes
roused
her
made
her
sleeping
soul
lift
up
its
head
a
moment
surprised
what
was
the
cheque
she
asked
seventeen
pounds
eleven
and
fivepence
and
sixteen
and
six
stoppages
replied
the
boy
it
a
good
week
and
only
five
shillings
stoppages
for
my
so
she
was
able
to
calculate
how
much
her
husband
had
earned
and
could
call
him
to
account
if
he
gave
her
short
money
morel
always
kept
to
himself
the
secret
of
the
week
amount
friday
was
the
baking
night
and
market
night
it
was
the
rule
that
paul
should
stay
at
home
and
bake
he
loved
to
stop
in
and
draw
or
read
he
was
very
fond
of
drawing
annie
always
gallivanted
on
friday
nights
arthur
was
enjoying
himself
as
usual
so
the
boy
remained
alone
morel
loved
her
marketing
in
the
tiny
on
the
top
of
the
hill
where
four
roads
from
nottingham
and
derby
ilkeston
and
mansfield
meet
many
stalls
were
erected
brakes
ran
in
from
surrounding
villages
the
was
full
of
women
the
streets
packed
with
men
it
was
amazing
to
see
so
many
men
everywhere
in
the
streets
morel
usually
quarrelled
with
her
lace
woman
sympathised
with
her
fruit
man
who
was
a
gabey
but
his
wife
was
a
bad
laughed
with
the
fish
man
who
was
a
scamp
but
so
droll
put
the
linoleum
man
in
his
place
was
cold
with
the
man
and
only
went
to
the
crockery
man
when
she
was
driven
or
drawn
by
the
cornflowers
on
a
little
dish
then
she
was
coldly
polite
i
wondered
how
much
that
little
dish
was
she
said
sevenpence
to
thank
she
put
the
dish
down
and
walked
away
but
she
could
not
leave
the
without
it
again
she
went
by
where
the
pots
lay
coldly
on
the
floor
and
she
glanced
at
the
dish
furtively
pretending
not
to
she
was
a
little
woman
in
a
bonnet
and
a
black
costume
her
bonnet
was
in
its
third
year
it
was
a
great
grievance
to
annie
mother
the
girl
implored
do
wear
that
nubbly
little
then
what
else
shall
i
wear
replied
the
mother
tartly
and
i
sure
it
right
it
had
started
with
a
tip
then
had
had
flowers
now
was
reduced
to
black
lace
and
a
bit
of
jet
it
looks
rather
come
down
said
paul
could
you
give
it
a
i
jowl
your
head
for
impudence
said
morel
and
she
tied
the
strings
of
the
black
bonnet
valiantly
under
her
chin
she
glanced
at
the
dish
again
both
she
and
her
enemy
the
pot
man
had
an
uncomfortable
feeling
as
if
there
were
something
between
them
suddenly
he
shouted
do
you
want
it
for
fivepence
she
started
her
heart
hardened
but
then
she
stooped
and
took
up
her
dish
i
have
it
she
said
yer
do
me
the
favour
like
he
said
yer
better
spit
in
it
like

when

paid
him
the
fivepence
in
a
cold
manner
i

she
said
you

me
have
it
for
fivepence
if
you
did
want

this
flamin
scrattlin
place
you
may
count

lucky
if

he
growled
yes

are
bad
times
and
good
said
morel
but
she
had
forgiven
the
pot
man
they
were
friends
she
dare
now
finger
his
pots
so
she
was
happy
paul
was
waiting
for
her
he
loved
her
she
was
always
her
best
so
triumphant
tired
laden
with
parcels
feeling
rich
in
spirit
he
heard
her
quick
light
step
in
the
entry
and
looked
up
from
his
drawing
oh
she
sighed
smiling
at
him
from
the
doorway

he
exclaimed
putting
down
his
brush
i

she
gasped
that

rag
of

paul

two
comforted
each
other
from
the
fear
of
having
robbed

paul
or

her
voice
bright
with
glee

loaf
on
the
base

said
giving

to

he
hopped
to
her
side
eagerly
to

she
unfolded
another
lump
of
newspaper
and
disclosed
some
roots
of
pansies
and
of
crimson
daisies

exclaimed
giving

to
pure
joy

a

old

paul
stooping
to
sniff
and
smells
that

but
he
a
bit
he
ran
in
the
scullery

back
with
the
flannel
and
carefully
washed
the
pansy
now
look
at
him
now
he
wet
he
said
yes
she
exclaimed
brimful
of
satisfaction
the
children
of
scargill
street
felt
quite
select
at
the
end
where
the
morels
lived
there
were
not
many
young
things
so
the
few
were
more
united
boys
and
girls
played
together
the
girls
joining
in
the
fights
and
the
rough
games
the
boys
taking
part
in
the
dancing
games
and
rings
and
of
the
girls
annie
and
paul
and
arthur
loved
the
winter
evenings
when
it
was
not
wet
they
stayed
indoors
till
the
colliers
were
all
gone
home
till
it
was
thick
dark
and
the
street
would
be
deserted
then
they
tied
their
scarves
round
their
necks
for
they
scorned
overcoats
as
all
the
colliers
children
did
and
went
out
the
entry
was
very
dark
and
at
the
end
the
whole
great
night
opened
out
in
a
hollow
with
a
little
tangle
of
lights
below
where
minton
pit
lay
and
another
far
away
opposite
for
selby
the
farthest
tiny
lights
seemed
to
stretch
out
the
darkness
for
ever
the
children
looked
anxiously
down
the
road
at
the
one
which
stood
at
the
end
of
the
field
path
if
the
little
luminous
space
were
deserted
the
two
boys
felt
genuine
desolation
they
stood
with
their
hands
in
their
pockets
under
the
lamp
turning
their
backs
on
the
night
quite
miserable
watching
the
dark
houses
suddenly
a
pinafore
under
a
short
coat
was
seen
and
a
girl
came
flying
up
where
billy
pillins
an
your
annie
an
eddie
dakin
i
do
but
it
did
not
matter
so
much
there
were
three
now
they
set
up
a
game
round
the
till
the
others
rushed
up
yelling
then
the
play
went
fast
and
furious
there
was
only
this
one
behind
was
the
great
scoop
of
darkness
as
if
all
the
night
were
there
in
front
another
wide
dark
way
opened
over
the
hill
brow
occasionally
somebody
came
out
of
this
way
and
went
into
the
field
down
the
path
in
a
dozen
yards
the
night
had
swallowed
them
the
children
played
on
they
were
brought
exceedingly
close
together
owing
to
their
isolation
if
a
quarrel
took
place
the
whole
play
was
spoilt
arthur
was
very
touchy
and
billy
pillins
really
philips
was
worse
then
paul
had
to
side
with
arthur
and
on
paul
side
went
alice
while
billy
pillins
always
had
emmie
limb
and
eddie
dakin
to
back
him
up
then
the
six
would
fight
hate
with
a
fury
of
hatred
and
flee
home
in
terror
paul
never
forgot
after
one
of
these
fierce
internecine
fights
seeing
a
big
red
moon
lift
itself
up
slowly
between
the
waste
road
over
the
hilltop
steadily
like
a
great
bird
and
he
thought
of
the
bible
that
the
moon
should
be
turned
to
blood
and
the
next
day
he
made
haste
to
be
friends
with
billy
pillins
and
then
the
wild
intense
games
went
on
again
under
the
surrounded
by
so
much
darkness
morel
going
into
her
parlour
would
hear
the
children
singing
away
my
shoes
are
made
of
spanish
leather
my
socks
are
made
of
silk
i
wear
a
ring
on
every
finger
i
wash
myself
in
they
sounded
so
perfectly
absorbed
in
the
game
as
their
voices
came
out
of
the
night
that
they
had
the
feel
of
wild
creatures
singing
it
stirred
the
mother
and
she
understood
when
they
came
in
at
eight
ruddy
with
brilliant
eyes
and
quick
passionate
speech
they
all
loved
the
scargill
street
house
for
its
openness
for
the
great
scallop
of
the
world
it
had
in
view
on
summer
evenings
the
women
would
stand
against
the
field
fence
gossiping
facing
the
west
watching
the
sunsets
flare
quickly
out
till
the
derbyshire
hills
ridged
across
the
crimson
far
away
like
the
black
crest
of
a
newt
in
this
summer
season
the
pits
never
turned
full
time
particularly
the
soft
coal
dakin
who
lived
next
door
to
morel
going
to
the
field
fence
to
shake
her
hearthrug
would
spy
men
coming
slowly
up
the
hill
she
saw
at
once
they
were
colliers
then
she
waited
a
tall
thin
woman
standing
on
the
hill
brow
almost
like
a
menace
to
the
poor
colliers
who
were
toiling
up
it
was
only
eleven
from
the
wooded
hills
the
haze
that
hangs
like
fine
black
crape
at
the
back
of
a
summer
morning
had
not
yet
dissipated
the
first
man
came
to
the
stile
went
the
gate
under
his
thrust
what
han
yer
knocked
off
cried
dakin
we
han
it
a
pity
as
they
letn
yer
goo
she
said
sarcastically
it
is
that
replied
the
man
nay
you
know
you
flig
to
come
up
again
she
said
and
the
man
went
on
dakin
going
up
her
yard
spied
morel
taking
the
ashes
to
the
i
reckon
minton
knocked
off
missis
she
cried
is

sickenin
exclaimed
morel
in
wrath
ha
but
just
seed
jont
they
might
as
well
have
saved
their
said
morel
and
both
women
went
indoors
disgusted
the
colliers
their
faces
scarcely
blackened
were
trooping
home
again
morel
hated
to
go
back
he
loved
the
sunny
morning
but
he
had
gone
to
pit
to
work
and
to
be
sent
home
again
spoilt
his
temper
good
gracious
at
this
time
exclaimed
his
wife
as
he
entered
can
i
help
it
woman
he
shouted
and
i
not
done
half
enough
then
i
eat
my
bit
o
snap
as
i
took
with
me
he
bawled
pathetically
he
felt
ignominious
and
sore
and
the
children
coming
home
from
school
would
wonder
to
see
their
father
eating
with
his
dinner
the
two
thick
slices
of
rather
dry
and
dirty
that
had
been
to
pit
and
back
what
my
dad
eating
his
snap
for
now
asked
arthur
i
should
it
holled
at
me
if
i
didna
snorted
morel
what
a
story
exclaimed
his
wife
an
is
it
goin
to
be
wasted
said
morel
i
not
such
a
extravagant
mortal
as
you
lot
with
your
waste
if
i
drop
a
bit
of
bread
at
pit
in
all
the
dust
an
dirt

pick
it
up

eat
the
mice

said
paul
it
would
be
good
not
for
mice
either
said
morel
dirty
or
not
dirty
i
eat
it
rather
than
it
should
be
you
might
leave
it
for
the
mice
and
pay
for
it
out
of
your
next
pint
said
morel
oh
might
i
he
exclaimed
they
were
very
poor
that
autumn
william
had
just
gone
away
to
london
and
his
mother
missed
his
money
he
sent
ten
shillings
once
or
twice
but
he
had
many
things
to
pay
for
at
first
his
letters
came
regularly
once
a
week
he
wrote
a
good
deal
to
his
mother
telling
her
all
his
life
how
he
made
friends
and
was
exchanging
lessons
with
a
frenchman
how
he
enjoyed
london
his
mother
felt
again
he
was
remaining
to
her
just
as
when
he
was
at
home
she
wrote
to
him
every
week
her
direct
rather
witty
letters
all
day
long
as
she
cleaned
the
house
she
thought
of
him
he
was
in
london
he
would
do
well
almost
he
was
like
her
knight
who
wore
her
favour
in
the
battle
he
was
coming
at
christmas
for
five
days
there
had
never
been
such
preparations
paul
and
arthur
scoured
the
land
for
holly
and
evergreens
annie
made
the
pretty
paper
hoops
in
the
way
and
there
was
extravagance
in
the
larder
morel
made
a
big
and
magnificent
cake
then
feeling
queenly
she
showed
paul
how
to
blanch
almonds
he
skinned
the
long
nuts
reverently
counting
them
all
to
see
not
one
was
lost
it
was
said
that
eggs
whisked
better
in
a
cold
place
so
the
boy
stood
in
the
scullery
where
the
temperature
was
nearly
at
and
whisked
and
whisked
and
flew
in
excitement
to
his
mother
as
the
white
of
egg
grew
stiffer
and
more
snowy
just
look
mother
is
it
lovely
and
he
balanced
a
bit
on
his
nose
then
blew
it
in
the
air
now
do
waste
it
said
the
mother
everybody
was
mad
with
excitement
william
was
coming
on
christmas
eve
morel
surveyed
her
pantry
there
was
a
big
plum
cake
and
a
rice
cake
jam
tarts
lemon
tarts
and
two
enormous
dishes
she
was
finishing
cooking
spanish
tarts
and
everywhere
was
decorated
the
kissing
bunch
of
berried
holly
hung
with
bright
and
glittering
things
spun
slowly
over
morel
head
as
she
trimmed
her
little
tarts
in
the
kitchen
a
great
fire
roared
there
was
a
scent
of
cooked
pastry
he
was
due
at
seven
but
he
would
be
late
the
three
children
had
gone
to
meet
him
she
was
alone
but
at
a
quarter
to
seven
morel
came
in
again
neither
wife
nor
husband
spoke
he
sat
in
his
armchair
quite
awkward
with
excitement
and
she
quietly
went
on
with
her
baking
only
by
the
careful
way
in
which
she
did
things
could
it
be
told
how
much
moved
she
was
the
clock
ticked
on
what
time
dost
say
he
coming
morel
asked
for
the
fifth
time
the
train

six
she
replied
emphatically
then
he
be
here
at
ten
past
eh
bless
you
it
be
hours
late
on
the
midland
she
said
indifferently
but
she
hoped
by
expecting
him
late
to
bring
him
early
morel
went
down
the
entry
to
look
for
him
then
he
came
back
goodness
man
she
said
you
like
an
hadna
you
better
be
gettin
him
summat
t
eat
ready
asked
the
father
there
plenty
of
time
she
answered
there
not
so
much
as
i
can
see
on
he
answered
turning
crossly
in
his
chair
she
began
to
clear
her
table
the
kettle
was
singing
they
waited
and
waited
meantime
the
three
children
were
on
the
platform
at
sethley
bridge
on
the
midland
main
line
two
miles
from
home
they
waited
one
hour
a
train
came
he
was
not
there
down
the
line
the
red
and
green
lights
shone
it
was
very
dark
and
very
cold
ask
him
if
the
london
train
come
said
paul
to
annie
when
they
saw
a
man
in
a
tip
cap
i
not
said
annie
you
be
quiet
he
might
send
us
but
paul
was
dying
for
the
man
to
know
they
were
expecting
someone
by
the
london
train
it
sounded
so
grand
yet
he
was
much
too
much
scared
of
broaching
any
man
let
alone
one
in
a
peaked
cap
to
dare
to
ask
the
three
children
could
scarcely
go
into
the
for
fear
of
being
sent
away
and
for
fear
something
should
happen
whilst
they
were
off
the
platform
still
they
waited
in
the
dark
and
cold
it
an
hour
an
a
half
late
said
arthur
pathetically
well
said
annie
it
christmas
they
all
grew
silent
he
was
coming
they
looked
down
the
darkness
of
the
railway
there
was
london
it
seemed
the
of
distance
they
thought
anything
might
happen
if
one
came
from
london
they
were
all
too
troubled
to
talk
cold
and
unhappy
and
silent
they
huddled
together
on
the
platform
at
last
after
more
than
two
hours
they
saw
the
lights
of
an
engine
peering
round
away
down
the
darkness
a
porter
ran
out
the
children
drew
back
with
beating
hearts
a
great
train
bound
for
manchester
drew
up
two
doors
opened
and
from
one
of
them
william
they
flew
to
him
he
handed
parcels
to
them
cheerily
and
immediately
began
to
explain
that
this
great
train
had
stopped
for
his
sake
at
such
a
small
station
as
sethley
bridge
it
was
not
booked
to
stop
meanwhile
the
parents
were
getting
anxious
the
table
was
set
the
chop
was
cooked
everything
was
ready
morel
put
on
her
black
apron
she
was
wearing
her
best
dress
then
she
sat
pretending
to
read
the
minutes
were
a
torture
to
her
h
said
morel
it
an
hour
an
a
and
those
children
waiting
she
said
th
train
canna
ha
come
in
yet
he
said
i
tell
you
on
christmas
eve
they
hours
they
were
both
a
bit
cross
with
each
other
so
gnawed
with
anxiety
the
ash
tree
moaned
outside
in
a
cold
raw
wind
and
all
that
space
of
night
from
london
home
morel
suffered
the
slight
click
of
the
works
inside
the
clock
irritated
her
it
was
getting
so
late
it
was
getting
unbearable
at
last
there
was
a
sound
of
voices
and
a
footstep
in
the
entry
ha
here
cried
morel
jumping
up
then
he
stood
back
the
mother
ran
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
and
waited
there
was
a
rush
and
a
patter
of
feet
the
door
burst
open
william
was
there
he
dropped
his
gladstone
bag
and
took
his
mother
in
his
arms
mater
he
said
my
boy
she
cried
and
for
two
seconds
no
longer
she
clasped
him
and
kissed
him
then
she
withdrew
and
said
trying
to
be
quite
normal
but
how
late
you
are
are
i
he
cried
turning
to
his
father
well
dad
the
two
men
shook
hands
well
my
lad
morel
eyes
were
wet
we
thought
tha
niver
be
commin
he
said
oh
i
come
exclaimed
william
then
the
son
turned
round
to
his
mother
but
you
look
well
she
said
proudly
laughing
well
he
exclaimed
i
should
think
so
coming
home
he
was
a
fine
fellow
big
straight
and
he
looked
round
at
the
evergreens
and
the
kissing
bunch
and
the
little
tarts
that
lay
in
their
tins
on
the
hearth
by
jove
mother
it
not
different
he
said
as
if
in
relief
everybody
was
still
for
a
second
then
he
suddenly
sprang
forward
picked
a
tart
from
the
hearth
and
pushed
it
whole
into
his
mouth
well
did
iver
you
see
such
a
parish
oven
the
father
exclaimed
he
had
brought
them
endless
presents
every
penny
he
had
he
had
spent
on
them
there
was
a
sense
of
luxury
overflowing
in
the
house
for
his
mother
there
was
an
umbrella
with
gold
on
the
pale
handle
she
kept
it
to
her
dying
day
and
would
have
lost
anything
rather
than
that
everybody
had
something
gorgeous
and
besides
there
were
pounds
of
unknown
sweets
turkish
delight
crystallised
pineapple
and
things
which
the
children
thought
only
the
splendour
of
london
could
provide
and
paul
boasted
of
these
sweets
among
his
friends
real
pineapple
cut
off
in
slices
and
then
turned
into
crystal
fair
grand
everybody
was
mad
with
happiness
in
the
family
home
was
home
and
they
loved
it
with
a
passion
of
love
whatever
the
suffering
had
been
there
were
parties
there
were
rejoicings
people
came
in
to
see
william
to
see
what
difference
london
had
made
to
him
and
they
all
found
him
such
a
gentleman
and
such
a
fine
fellow
my
word
when
he
went
away
again
the
children
retired
to
various
places
to
weep
alone
morel
went
to
bed
in
misery
and
morel
felt
as
if
she
were
numbed
by
some
drug
as
if
her
feelings
were
paralysed
she
loved
him
passionately
he
was
in
the
office
of
a
lawyer
connected
with
a
large
shipping
firm
and
at
the
midsummer
his
chief
offered
him
a
trip
in
the
mediterranean
on
one
of
the
boats
for
quite
a
small
cost
morel
wrote
go
go
my
boy
you
may
never
have
a
chance
again
and
i
should
love
to
think
of
you
cruising
there
in
the
mediterranean
almost
better
than
to
have
you
at
but
william
came
home
for
his
fortnight
holiday
not
even
the
mediterranean
which
pulled
at
all
his
young
man
desire
to
travel
and
at
his
poor
man
wonder
at
the
glamorous
south
could
take
him
away
when
he
might
come
home
that
compensated
his
mother
for
much
chapter
v
paul
launches
into
life
morel
was
rather
a
heedless
man
careless
of
danger
so
he
had
endless
accidents
now
when
morel
heard
the
rattle
of
an
empty
cease
at
her
she
ran
into
the
parlour
to
look
expecting
almost
to
see
her
husband
seated
in
the
waggon
his
face
grey
under
his
dirt
his
body
limp
and
sick
with
some
hurt
or
other
if
it
were
he
she
would
run
out
to
help
about
a
year
after
william
went
to
london
and
just
after
paul
had
left
school
before
he
got
work
morel
was
upstairs
and
her
son
was
painting
in
the
kitchen
he
was
very
clever
with
his
brush
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
crossly
he
put
down
his
brush
to
go
at
the
same
moment
his
mother
opened
a
window
upstairs
and
looked
down
a
in
his
dirt
stood
on
the
threshold
is
this
walter
morel
he
asked
yes
said
morel
what
is
it
but
she
had
guessed
already
your
mester
got
hurt
he
said
eh
dear
me
she
exclaimed
it
a
wonder
if
he
had
lad
and
what
he
done
this
time
i
do
know
for
sure
but
it
leg
somewhere
they
ter
th
good
gracious
me
she
exclaimed
eh
dear
what
a
one
he
is
not
five
minutes
of
peace
i
be
hanged
if
there
is
his
nearly
better
and
now
did
you
see
him
i
seed
him
at
th
bottom
an
i
seed
bring
up
in
a
tub
wor
in
a
dead
faint
but
he
shouted
like
anythink
when
doctor
fraser
examined

she
came
downstairs
paul
had
mechanically
resumed
his
painting
and
it
must
be
pretty
bad
if
they
taken
him
to
the
hospital
she
went
on
but
what
a
careless
creature
he
is
other
men
do
have
all
these
accidents
yes
he
would
want
to
put
all
the

just
as

getting
easy
a
bit
at

time

s
have
to
leave

it
said
paul
you
need
i
shall
catch
the
seven
back
i
should
think
oh
my
blessed
heart
the
fuss
and
commotion
he
make
and
those
granite
setts
at
tinder
hill
he
might
well
call
them
kidney
pebbles
jolt
him
almost
to
bits
i
wonder
why
they
ca
mend
them
the
state
they
in
an
all
the
men
as
go
across
in
that
ambulance
you
think
they
have
a
hospital
here
the
men
bought
the
ground
and
my
sirs
there
be
accidents
enough
to
keep
it
going
but
no
they
must
trail
them
ten
miles
in
a
slow
ambulance
to
nottingham
it
a
crying
shame
oh
and
the
fuss
he
make
i
know
he
will
i
wonder
who
with
him
barker
i
s
think
poor
beggar
he
wish
himself
anywhere
rather
but
he
look
after
him
i
know
now
there
no
telling
how
long
be
stuck
in
that
hospital
and
wo
he
hate
it
but
if
it
only
his
leg
it
not
so
all
the
time
she
was
getting
ready
hurriedly
taking
off
her
bodice
she
crouched
at
the
boiler
while
the
water
ran
slowly
into
her
i
wish
this
boiler
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
she
exclaimed
wriggling
the
handle
impatiently
she
had
very
handsome
strong
arms
rather
surprising
on
a
smallish
woman
paul
cleared
away
put
on
the
kettle
and
set
the
table
there
is
a
train
till
he
said
you
time
oh
no
i
have
she
cried
blinking
at
him
over
the
towel
as
she
wiped
her
face
yes
you
have
you
must
drink
a
cup
of
tea
at
any
rate
should
i
come
with
you
to
keston
come
with
me
what
for
i
should
like
to
know
now
what
have
i
to
take
him
eh
dear
his
clean
shirt
and
it
a
blessing
it
is
clean
but
it
had
better
be
aired
and
stockings
he
wo
want
them
and
a
towel
i
suppose
and
handkerchiefs
now
what
else
a
comb
a
knife
and
fork
and
spoon
said
paul
his
father
had
been
in
the
hospital
before
goodness
knows
what
sort
of
state
his
feet
were
in
continued
morel
as
she
combed
her
long
brown
hair
that
was
fine
as
silk
and
was
touched
now
with
grey
he
very
particular
to
wash
himself
to
the
waist
but
below
he
thinks
does
matter
but
there
i
suppose
they
see
plenty
like
paul
had
laid
the
table
he
cut
his
mother
one
or
two
pieces
of
very
thin
bread
and
butter
here
you
are
he
said
putting
her
cup
of
tea
in
her
place
i
ca
be
bothered
she
exclaimed
crossly
well
you
got
to
so
there
now
it
put
out
ready
he
insisted
so
she
sat
down
and
sipped
her
tea
and
ate
a
little
in
silence
she
was
thinking
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
gone
to
walk
the
two
and
a
half
miles
to
keston
station
all
the
things
she
was
taking
him
she
had
in
her
bulging
string
bag
paul
watched
her
go
up
the
road
between
the
hedges
a
little
figure
and
his
heart
ached
for
her
that
she
was
thrust
forward
again
into
pain
and
trouble
and
she
tripping
so
quickly
in
her
anxiety
felt
at
the
back
of
her
her
son
heart
waiting
on
her
felt
him
bearing
what
part
of
the
burden
he
could
even
supporting
her
and
when
she
was
at
the
hospital
she
thought
it
will
upset
that
lad
when
i
tell
him
how
bad
it
is
i
better
be
and
when
she
was
trudging
home
again
she
felt
he
was
coming
to
share
her
burden
is
it
bad
asked
paul
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
house
it
bad
enough
she
replied
what
she
sighed
and
sat
down
undoing
her
her
son
watched
her
face
as
it
was
lifted
and
her
small
hands
fingering
at
the
bow
under
her
chin
well
she
answered
it
not
really
dangerous
but
the
nurse
says
it
a
dreadful
smash
you
see
a
great
piece
of
rock
fell
on
his
leg
here
and
it
a
compound
fracture
there
are
pieces
of
bone
sticking
through
ugh
how
horrid
exclaimed
the
children
and
she
continued
of
course
he
says
he
going
to
die
it
be
him
if
he
did
done
for
my
lass
he
said
looking
at
me
be
so
silly
i
said
to
him
not
going
to
die
of
a
broken
leg
however
badly
it
smashed
s
niver
come
out
of
but
in
a
wooden
box
he
groaned
i
said
you
want
them
to
carry
you
into
the
garden
in
a
wooden
box
when
you
better
i
no
doubt
they
will
we
think
it
good
for
him
said
the
sister
she
an
awfully
nice
sister
but
rather
morel
took
off
her
bonnet
the
children
waited
in
silence
of
course
he
is
bad
she
continued
and
he
will
be
it
a
great
shock
and
he
lost
a
lot
of
blood
and
of
course
it
is
a
very
dangerous
smash
it
not
at
all
sure
that
it
will
mend
so
easily
and
then
there
the
fever
and
the
mortification
if
it
took
bad
ways
quickly
be
gone
but
there
he
a
man
with
wonderful
healing
flesh
and
so
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
take
bad
ways
of
course
there
a
wound
she
was
pale
now
with
emotion
and
anxiety
the
three
children
realised
that
it
was
very
bad
for
their
father
and
the
house
was
silent
anxious
but
he
always
gets
better
said
paul
after
a
while
that
what
i
tell
him
said
the
mother
everybody
moved
about
in
silence
and
he
really
looked
nearly
done
for
she
said
but
the
sister
says
that
is
the
annie
took
away
her
mother
coat
and
bonnet
and
he
looked
at
me
when
i
came
away
i
said
s
have
to
go
now
walter
because
of
the
train
and
the
children
and
he
looked
at
me
it
seems
paul
took
up
his
brush
again
and
went
on
painting
arthur
went
outside
for
some
coal
annie
sat
looking
dismal
and
morel
in
her
little
that
her
husband
had
made
for
her
when
the
first
baby
was
coming
remained
motionless
brooding
she
was
grieved
and
bitterly
sorry
for
the
man
who
was
hurt
so
much
but
still
in
her
heart
of
hearts
where
the
love
should
have
burned
there
was
a
blank
now
when
all
her
woman
pity
was
roused
to
its
full
extent
when
she
would
have
slaved
herself
to
death
to
nurse
him
and
to
save
him
when
she
would
have
taken
the
pain
herself
if
she
could
somewhere
far
away
inside
her
she
felt
indifferent
to
him
and
to
his
suffering
it
hurt
her
most
of
all
this
failure
to
love
him
even
when
he
roused
her
strong
emotions
she
brooded
a
while
and
there
she
said
suddenly
when
i
got
halfway
to
keston
i
found
i
come
out
in
my
working
boots
and
look
at
they
were
an
old
pair
of
paul
brown
and
rubbed
through
at
the
toes
i
did
know
what
to
do
with
myself
for
shame
she
added
in
the
morning
when
annie
and
arthur
were
at
school
morel
talked
again
to
her
son
who
was
helping
her
with
her
housework
i
found
barker
at
the
hospital
he
did
look
bad
poor
little
fellow
i
said
to
him
sort
of
a
journey
did
you
have
with
him
ax
me
missis
he
said
i
said
know
what
he
be
it
wor
bad
for
him
morel
it
wor
that
he
said
know
i
said
ivry
jolt
i
thought
my
would
ha
flown
clean
out
o
my
mouth
he
said
the
scream
gives
sometimes
missis
not
for
a
fortune
would
i
go
through
wi
it
again
can
quite
understand
it
i
said
a
nasty
job
though
he
said
one
as
be
a
long
while
afore
it
right
again
afraid
it
will
i
said
i
like
barker
i
do
like
him
there
something
so
manly
about
paul
resumed
his
task
silently
and
of
course
morel
continued
for
a
man
like
your
father
the
hospital
is
hard
he
ca
understand
rules
and
regulations
and
he
wo
let
anybody
else
touch
him
not
if
he
can
help
it
when
he
smashed
the
muscles
of
his
thigh
and
it
had
to
be
dressed
four
times
a
day
would
he
let
anybody
but
me
or
his
mother
do
it
he
would
so
of
course
he
suffer
in
there
with
the
nurses
and
i
did
like
leaving
him
i
sure
when
i
kissed
him
an
came
away
it
seemed
a
so
she
talked
to
her
son
almost
as
if
she
were
thinking
aloud
to
him
and
he
took
it
in
as
best
he
could
by
sharing
her
trouble
to
lighten
it
and
in
the
end
she
shared
almost
everything
with
him
without
knowing
morel
had
a
very
bad
time
for
a
week
he
was
in
a
critical
condition
then
he
began
to
mend
and
then
knowing
he
was
going
to
get
better
the
whole
family
sighed
with
relief
and
proceeded
to
live
happily
they
were
not
badly
off
whilst
morel
was
in
the
hospital
there
were
fourteen
shillings
a
week
from
the
pit
ten
shillings
from
the
sick
club
and
five
shillings
from
the
disability
fund
and
then
every
week
the
butties
had
something
for
morel
five
or
seven
shillings
so
that
she
was
quite
well
to
do
and
whilst
morel
was
progressing
favourably
in
the
hospital
the
family
was
extraordinarily
happy
and
peaceful
on
saturdays
and
wednesdays
morel
went
to
nottingham
to
see
her
husband
then
she
always
brought
back
some
little
thing
a
small
tube
of
paints
for
paul
or
some
thick
paper
a
couple
of
postcards
for
annie
that
the
whole
family
rejoiced
over
for
days
before
the
girl
was
allowed
to
send
them
away
or
a
for
arthur
or
a
bit
of
pretty
wood
she
described
her
adventures
into
the
big
shops
with
joy
soon
the
folk
in
the
knew
her
and
knew
about
paul
the
girl
in
the
took
a
keen
interest
in
her
morel
was
full
of
information
when
she
got
home
from
nottingham
the
three
sat
round
till
listening
putting
in
arguing
then
paul
often
raked
the
fire
i
the
man
in
the
house
now
he
used
to
say
to
his
mother
with
joy
they
learned
how
perfectly
peaceful
the
home
could
be
and
they
almost
regretted
though
none
of
them
would
have
owned
to
such
callousness
that
their
father
was
soon
coming
back
paul
was
now
fourteen
and
was
looking
for
work
he
was
a
rather
small
and
rather
boy
with
dark
brown
hair
and
light
blue
eyes
his
face
had
already
lost
its
youthful
chubbiness
and
was
becoming
somewhat
like
william
almost
rugged
and
it
was
extraordinarily
mobile
usually
he
looked
as
if
he
saw
things
was
full
of
life
and
warm
then
his
smile
like
his
mother
came
suddenly
and
was
very
lovable
and
then
when
there
was
any
clog
in
his
soul
quick
running
his
face
went
stupid
and
ugly
he
was
the
sort
of
boy
that
becomes
a
clown
and
a
lout
as
soon
as
he
is
not
understood
or
feels
himself
held
cheap
and
again
is
adorable
at
the
first
touch
of
warmth
he
suffered
very
much
from
the
first
contact
with
anything
when
he
was
seven
the
starting
school
had
been
a
nightmare
and
a
torture
to
him
but
afterwards
he
liked
it
and
now
that
he
felt
he
had
to
go
out
into
life
he
went
through
agonies
of
shrinking
he
was
quite
a
clever
painter
for
a
boy
of
his
years
and
he
knew
some
french
and
german
and
mathematics
that
heaton
had
taught
him
but
nothing
he
had
was
of
any
commercial
value
he
was
not
strong
enough
for
heavy
manual
work
his
mother
said
he
did
not
care
for
making
things
with
his
hands
preferred
racing
about
or
making
excursions
into
the
country
or
reading
or
painting
what
do
you
want
to
be
his
mother
asked
that
is
no
answer
said
morel
but
it
was
quite
truthfully
the
only
answer
he
could
give
his
ambition
as
far
as
this
world
gear
went
was
quietly
to
earn
his
thirty
or
shillings
a
week
somewhere
near
home
and
then
when
his
father
died
have
a
cottage
with
his
mother
paint
and
go
out
as
he
liked
and
live
happy
ever
after
that
was
his
programme
as
far
as
doing
things
went
but
he
was
proud
within
himself
measuring
people
against
himself
and
placing
them
inexorably
and
he
thought
that
perhaps
he
might
also
make
a
painter
the
real
thing
but
that
he
left
alone
then
said
his
mother
you
must
look
in
the
paper
for
the
he
looked
at
her
it
seemed
to
him
a
bitter
humiliation
and
an
anguish
to
go
through
but
he
said
nothing
when
he
got
up
in
the
morning
his
whole
being
was
knotted
up
over
this
one
thought
i
got
to
go
and
look
for
advertisements
for
a
it
stood
in
front
of
the
morning
that
thought
killing
all
joy
and
even
life
for
him
his
heart
felt
like
a
tight
knot
and
then
at
ten
he
set
off
he
was
supposed
to
be
a
queer
quiet
child
going
up
the
sunny
street
of
the
little
town
he
felt
as
if
all
the
folk
he
met
said
to
themselves
he
going
to
the
to
look
in
the
papers
for
a
place
he
ca
get
a
job
i
suppose
he
living
on
his
then
he
crept
up
the
stone
stairs
behind
the
drapery
shop
at
the
and
peeped
in
the
usually
one
or
two
men
were
there
either
old
useless
fellows
or
colliers
on
the
club
so
he
entered
full
of
shrinking
and
suffering
when
they
looked
up
seated
himself
at
the
table
and
pretended
to
scan
the
news
he
knew
they
would
think
what
does
a
lad
of
thirteen
want
in
a
with
a
newspaper
and
he
suffered
then
he
looked
wistfully
out
of
the
window
already
he
was
a
prisoner
of
industrialism
large
sunflowers
stared
over
the
old
red
wall
of
the
garden
opposite
looking
in
their
jolly
way
down
on
the
women
who
were
hurrying
with
something
for
dinner
the
valley
was
full
of
corn
brightening
in
the
sun
two
collieries
among
the
fields
waved
their
small
white
plumes
of
steam
far
off
on
the
hills
were
the
woods
of
annesley
dark
and
fascinating
already
his
heart
went
down
he
was
being
taken
into
bondage
his
freedom
in
the
beloved
home
valley
was
going
now
the
brewers
waggons
came
rolling
up
from
keston
with
enormous
barrels
four
a
side
like
beans
in
a
burst
the
waggoner
throned
aloft
rolling
massively
in
his
seat
was
not
so
much
below
paul
eye
the
man
hair
on
his
small
bullet
head
was
bleached
almost
white
by
the
sun
and
on
his
thick
red
arms
rocking
idly
on
his
sack
apron
the
white
hairs
glistened
his
red
face
shone
and
was
almost
asleep
with
sunshine
the
horses
handsome
and
brown
went
on
by
themselves
looking
by
far
the
masters
of
the
show
paul
wished
he
were
stupid
i
wish
he
thought
to
himself
i
was
fat
like
him
and
like
a
dog
in
the
sun
i
wish
i
was
a
pig
and
a
then
the
room
being
at
last
empty
he
would
hastily
copy
an
advertisement
on
a
scrap
of
paper
then
another
and
slip
out
in
immense
relief
his
mother
would
scan
over
his
copies
yes
she
said
you
may
william
had
written
out
a
letter
of
application
couched
in
admirable
business
language
which
paul
copied
with
variations
the
handwriting
was
execrable
so
that
william
who
did
all
things
well
got
into
a
fever
of
impatience
the
elder
brother
was
becoming
quite
swanky
in
london
he
found
that
he
could
associate
with
men
far
above
his
bestwood
friends
in
station
some
of
the
clerks
in
the
office
had
studied
for
the
law
and
were
more
or
less
going
through
a
kind
of
apprenticeship
william
always
made
friends
among
men
wherever
he
went
he
was
so
jolly
therefore
he
was
soon
visiting
and
staying
in
houses
of
men
who
in
bestwood
would
have
looked
down
on
the
unapproachable
bank
manager
and
would
merely
have
called
indifferently
on
the
rector
so
he
began
to
fancy
himself
as
a
great
gun
he
was
indeed
rather
surprised
at
the
ease
with
which
he
became
a
gentleman
his
mother
was
glad
he
seemed
so
pleased
and
his
lodging
in
walthamstow
was
so
dreary
but
now
there
seemed
to
come
a
kind
of
fever
into
the
young
man
letters
he
was
unsettled
by
all
the
change
he
did
not
stand
firm
on
his
own
feet
but
seemed
to
spin
rather
giddily
on
the
quick
current
of
the
new
life
his
mother
was
anxious
for
him
she
could
feel
him
losing
himself
he
had
danced
and
gone
to
the
theatre
boated
on
the
river
been
out
with
friends
and
she
knew
he
sat
up
afterwards
in
his
cold
bedroom
grinding
away
at
latin
because
he
intended
to
get
on
in
his
office
and
in
the
law
as
much
as
he
could
he
never
sent
his
mother
any
money
now
it
was
all
taken
the
little
he
had
for
his
own
life
and
she
did
not
want
any
except
sometimes
when
she
was
in
a
tight
corner
and
when
ten
shillings
would
have
saved
her
much
worry
she
still
dreamed
of
william
and
of
what
he
would
do
with
herself
behind
him
never
for
a
minute
would
she
admit
to
herself
how
heavy
and
anxious
her
heart
was
because
of
him
also
he
talked
a
good
deal
now
of
a
girl
he
had
met
at
a
dance
a
handsome
brunette
quite
young
and
a
lady
after
whom
the
men
were
running
thick
and
fast
i
wonder
if
you
would
run
my
boy
his
mother
wrote
to
him
unless
you
saw
all
the
other
men
chasing
her
too
you
feel
safe
enough
and
vain
enough
in
a
crowd
but
take
care
and
see
how
you
feel
when
you
find
yourself
alone
and
in
william
resented
these
things
and
continued
the
chase
he
had
taken
the
girl
on
the
river
if
you
saw
her
mother
you
would
know
how
i
feel
tall
and
elegant
with
the
clearest
of
clear
transparent
olive
complexions
hair
as
black
as
jet
and
such
grey
eyes
bright
mocking
like
lights
on
water
at
night
it
is
all
very
well
to
be
a
bit
satirical
till
you
see
her
and
she
dresses
as
well
as
any
woman
in
london
i
tell
you
your
son
does
half
put
his
head
up
when
she
goes
walking
down
piccadilly
with
morel
wondered
in
her
heart
if
her
son
did
not
go
walking
down
piccadilly
with
an
elegant
figure
and
fine
clothes
rather
than
with
a
woman
who
was
near
to
him
but
she
congratulated
him
in
her
doubtful
fashion
and
as
she
stood
over
the
the
mother
brooded
over
her
son
she
saw
him
saddled
with
an
elegant
and
expensive
wife
earning
little
money
dragging
along
and
getting
draggled
in
some
small
ugly
house
in
a
suburb
but
there
she
told
herself
i
am
very
likely
a
silly
meeting
trouble
nevertheless
the
load
of
anxiety
scarcely
ever
left
her
heart
lest
william
should
do
the
wrong
thing
by
himself
presently
paul
was
bidden
call
upon
thomas
jordan
manufacturer
of
surgical
appliances
at
spaniel
row
nottingham
morel
was
all
joy
there
you
see
she
cried
her
eyes
shining
you
only
written
four
letters
and
the
third
is
answered
you
lucky
my
boy
as
i
always
said
you
paul
looked
at
the
picture
of
a
wooden
leg
adorned
with
elastic
stockings
and
other
appliances
that
figured
on
jordan
notepaper
and
he
felt
alarmed
he
had
not
known
that
elastic
stockings
existed
and
he
seemed
to
feel
the
business
world
with
its
regulated
system
of
values
and
its
impersonality
and
he
dreaded
it
it
seemed
monstrous
also
that
a
business
could
be
run
on
wooden
legs
mother
and
son
set
off
together
one
tuesday
morning
it
was
august
and
blazing
hot
paul
walked
with
something
screwed
up
tight
inside
him
he
would
have
suffered
much
physical
pain
rather
than
this
unreasonable
suffering
at
being
exposed
to
strangers
to
be
accepted
or
rejected
yet
he
chattered
away
with
his
mother
he
would
never
have
confessed
to
her
how
he
suffered
over
these
things
and
she
only
partly
guessed
she
was
gay
like
a
sweetheart
she
stood
in
front
of
the
at
bestwood
and
paul
watched
her
take
from
her
purse
the
money
for
the
tickets
as
he
saw
her
hands
in
their
old
black
kid
gloves
getting
the
silver
out
of
the
worn
purse
his
heart
contracted
with
pain
of
love
of
her
she
was
quite
excited
and
quite
gay
he
suffered
because
she
would
talk
aloud
in
presence
of
the
other
travellers
now
look
at
that
silly
cow
she
said
careering
round
as
if
it
thought
it
was
a
it
most
likely
a
bottfly
he
said
very
low
a
what
she
asked
brightly
and
unashamed
they
thought
a
while
he
was
sensible
all
the
time
of
having
her
opposite
him
suddenly
their
eyes
met
and
she
smiled
to
him
a
rare
intimate
smile
beautiful
with
brightness
and
love
then
each
looked
out
of
the
window
the
sixteen
slow
miles
of
railway
journey
passed
the
mother
and
son
walked
down
station
street
feeling
the
excitement
of
lovers
having
an
adventure
together
in
carrington
street
they
stopped
to
hang
over
the
parapet
and
look
at
the
barges
on
the
canal
below
it
just
like
venice
he
said
seeing
the
sunshine
on
the
water
that
lay
between
high
factory
walls
perhaps
she
answered
smiling
they
enjoyed
the
shops
immensely
now
you
see
that
blouse
she
would
say
would
that
just
suit
our
annie
and
for
is
that
cheap
and
made
of
needlework
as
well
he
said
they
had
plenty
of
time
so
they
did
not
hurry
the
town
was
strange
and
delightful
to
them
but
the
boy
was
tied
up
inside
in
a
knot
of
apprehension
he
dreaded
the
interview
with
thomas
jordan
it
was
nearly
eleven
by
peter
church
they
turned
up
a
narrow
street
that
led
to
the
castle
it
was
gloomy
and
having
low
dark
shops
and
dark
green
house
doors
with
brass
knockers
and
doorsteps
projecting
on
to
the
pavement
then
another
old
shop
whose
small
window
looked
like
a
cunning
eye
mother
and
son
went
cautiously
looking
everywhere
for
thomas
jordan
and
son
it
was
like
hunting
in
some
wild
place
they
were
on
tiptoe
of
excitement
suddenly
they
spied
a
big
dark
archway
in
which
were
names
of
various
firms
thomas
jordan
among
them
here
it
is
said
morel
but
now
where
is
it
they
looked
round
on
one
side
was
a
queer
dark
cardboard
factory
on
the
other
a
commercial
hotel
it
up
the
entry
said
paul
and
they
ventured
under
the
archway
as
into
the
jaws
of
the
dragon
they
emerged
into
a
wide
yard
like
a
well
with
buildings
all
round
it
was
littered
with
straw
and
boxes
and
cardboard
the
sunshine
actually
caught
one
crate
whose
straw
was
streaming
on
to
the
yard
like
gold
but
elsewhere
the
place
was
like
a
pit
there
were
several
doors
and
two
flights
of
steps
straight
in
front
on
a
dirty
glass
door
at
the
top
of
a
staircase
loomed
the
ominous
words
thomas
jordan
and
son
surgical
morel
went
first
her
son
followed
her
charles
i
mounted
his
scaffold
with
a
lighter
heart
than
had
paul
morel
as
he
followed
his
mother
up
the
dirty
steps
to
the
dirty
door
she
pushed
open
the
door
and
stood
in
pleased
surprise
in
front
of
her
was
a
big
warehouse
with
creamy
paper
parcels
everywhere
and
clerks
with
their
rolled
back
were
going
about
in
an
sort
of
way
the
light
was
subdued
the
glossy
cream
parcels
seemed
luminous
the
counters
were
of
dark
brown
wood
all
was
quiet
and
very
homely
morel
took
two
steps
forward
then
waited
paul
stood
behind
her
she
had
on
her
sunday
bonnet
and
a
black
veil
he
wore
a
boy
broad
white
collar
and
a
norfolk
suit
one
of
the
clerks
looked
up
he
was
thin
and
tall
with
a
small
face
his
way
of
looking
was
alert
then
he
glanced
round
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
was
a
glass
office
and
then
he
came
forward
he
did
not
say
anything
but
leaned
in
a
gentle
inquiring
fashion
towards
morel
can
i
see
jordan
she
asked
i
fetch
him
answered
the
young
man
he
went
down
to
the
glass
office
a
old
man
looked
up
he
reminded
paul
of
a
pomeranian
dog
then
the
same
little
man
came
up
the
room
he
had
short
legs
was
rather
stout
and
wore
an
alpaca
jacket
so
with
one
ear
up
as
it
were
he
came
stoutly
and
inquiringly
down
the
room
he
said
hesitating
before
morel
in
doubt
as
to
whether
she
were
a
customer
or
not
i
came
with
my
son
paul
morel
you
asked
him
to
call
this
come
this
way
said
jordan
in
a
rather
snappy
little
manner
intended
to
be
businesslike
they
followed
the
manufacturer
into
a
grubby
little
room
upholstered
in
black
american
leather
glossy
with
the
rubbing
of
many
customers
on
the
table
was
a
pile
of
trusses
yellow
hoops
tangled
together
they
looked
new
and
living
paul
sniffed
the
odour
of
new
he
wondered
what
the
things
were
by
this
time
he
was
so
much
stunned
that
he
only
noticed
the
outside
things
sit
down
said
jordan
irritably
pointing
morel
to
a
chair
she
sat
on
the
edge
in
an
uncertain
fashion
then
the
little
old
man
fidgeted
and
found
a
paper
did
you
write
this
letter
he
snapped
thrusting
what
paul
recognised
as
his
own
notepaper
in
front
of
him
yes
he
answered
at
that
moment
he
was
occupied
in
two
ways
first
in
feeling
guilty
for
telling
a
lie
since
william
had
composed
the
letter
second
in
wondering
why
his
letter
seemed
so
strange
and
different
in
the
fat
red
hand
of
the
man
from
what
it
had
been
when
it
lay
on
the
kitchen
table
it
was
like
part
of
himself
gone
astray
he
resented
the
way
the
man
held
it
where
did
you
learn
to
write
said
the
old
man
crossly
paul
merely
looked
at
him
shamedly
and
did
not
answer
he
is
a
bad
writer
put
in
morel
apologetically
then
she
pushed
up
her
veil
paul
hated
her
for
not
being
prouder
with
this
common
little
man
and
he
loved
her
face
clear
of
the
veil
and
you
say
you
know
french
inquired
the
little
man
still
sharply
yes
said
paul
what
school
did
you
go
to
the
and
did
you
learn
it
there
no
i
the
boy
went
crimson
and
got
no
farther
his
godfather
gave
him
lessons
said
morel
half
pleading
and
rather
distant
jordan
hesitated
then
in
his
irritable
manner
he
always
seemed
to
keep
his
hands
ready
for
action
he
pulled
another
sheet
of
paper
from
his
pocket
unfolded
it
the
paper
made
a
crackling
noise
he
handed
it
to
paul
read
that
he
said
it
was
a
note
in
french
in
thin
flimsy
foreign
handwriting
that
the
boy
could
not
decipher
he
stared
blankly
at
the
paper
he
began
then
he
looked
in
great
confusion
at
jordan
it
the
it
the
he
wanted
to
say
handwriting
but
his
wits
would
no
longer
work
even
sufficiently
to
supply
him
with
the
word
feeling
an
utter
fool
and
hating
jordan
he
turned
desperately
to
the
paper
again
please
send
me
er
er
i
ca
tell
the
er
pairs
gris
fil
bas
grey
thread
stockings
er
er
without
er
i
tell
the
words
er
fingers
er
i
ca
tell
the
he
wanted
to
say
handwriting
but
the
word
still
refused
to
come
seeing
him
stuck
jordan
snatched
the
paper
from
him
send
by
return
two
pairs
grey
thread
stockings
without
toes
well
flashed
paul
means
as
well
as
a
rule
the
little
man
looked
at
him
he
did
not
know
whether
doigts
meant
fingers
he
knew
that
for
all
his
purposes
it
meant
toes
fingers
to
stockings
he
snapped
well
it
does
mean
fingers
the
boy
persisted
he
hated
the
little
man
who
made
such
a
clod
of
him
jordan
looked
at
the
pale
stupid
defiant
boy
then
at
the
mother
who
sat
quiet
and
with
that
peculiar
look
of
the
poor
who
have
to
depend
on
the
favour
of
others
and
when
could
he
come
he
asked
well
said
morel
as
soon
as
you
wish
he
has
finished
school
he
would
live
in
bestwood
yes
but
he
could
be
in
at
the
station
at
quarter
to
h
it
ended
by
paul
being
engaged
as
junior
spiral
clerk
at
eight
shillings
a
week
the
boy
did
not
open
his
mouth
to
say
another
word
after
having
insisted
that
doigts
meant
fingers
he
followed
his
mother
down
the
stairs
she
looked
at
him
with
her
bright
blue
eyes
full
of
love
and
joy
i
think
you
like
it
she
said
does
mean
mother
and
it
was
the
writing
i
could
read
the
never
mind
my
boy
i
sure
he
be
all
right
and
you
wo
see
much
of
him
was
that
first
young
fellow
nice
i
sure
you
like
but
was
jordan
common
mother
does
he
own
it
all
i
suppose
he
was
a
workman
who
has
got
on
she
said
you
must
mind
people
so
much
they
not
being
disagreeable
to
you
it
their
way
you
always
think
people
are
meaning
things
for
you
but
they
it
was
very
sunny
over
the
big
desolate
space
of
the
the
blue
sky
shimmered
and
the
granite
cobbles
of
the
paving
glistened
shops
down
the
long
row
were
deep
in
obscurity
and
the
shadow
was
full
of
colour
just
where
the
horse
trams
trundled
across
the
market
was
a
row
of
fruit
stalls
with
fruit
blazing
in
the
sun
apples
and
piles
of
reddish
oranges
small
plums
and
bananas
there
was
a
warm
scent
of
fruit
as
mother
and
son
passed
gradually
his
feeling
of
ignominy
and
of
rage
sank
where
should
we
go
for
dinner
asked
the
mother
it
was
felt
to
be
a
reckless
extravagance
paul
had
only
been
in
an
once
or
twice
in
his
life
and
then
only
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
a
bun
most
of
the
people
of
bestwood
considered
that
tea
and
and
perhaps
potted
beef
was
all
they
could
afford
to
eat
in
nottingham
real
cooked
dinner
was
considered
great
extravagance
paul
felt
rather
guilty
they
found
a
place
that
looked
quite
cheap
but
when
morel
scanned
the
bill
of
fare
her
heart
was
heavy
things
were
so
dear
so
she
ordered
and
potatoes
as
the
cheapest
available
dish
we
ought
to
have
come
here
mother
said
paul
never
mind
she
said
we
wo
come
she
insisted
on
his
having
a
small
currant
tart
because
he
liked
sweets
i
do
want
it
mother
he
pleaded
yes
she
insisted
you
have
and
she
looked
round
for
the
waitress
but
the
waitress
was
busy
and
morel
did
not
like
to
bother
her
then
so
the
mother
and
son
waited
for
the
girl
pleasure
whilst
she
flirted
among
the
men
brazen
hussy
said
morel
to
paul
look
now
she
taking
that
man
his
pudding
and
he
came
long
after
it
does
matter
mother
said
paul
morel
was
angry
but
she
was
too
poor
and
her
orders
were
too
meagre
so
that
she
had
not
the
courage
to
insist
on
her
rights
just
then
they
waited
and
waited
should
we
go
mother
he
said
then
morel
stood
up
the
girl
was
passing
near
will
you
bring
one
currant
tart
said
morel
clearly
the
girl
looked
round
insolently
directly
she
said
we
have
waited
quite
long
enough
said
morel
in
a
moment
the
girl
came
back
with
the
tart
morel
asked
coldly
for
the
bill
paul
wanted
to
sink
through
the
floor
he
marvelled
at
his
mother
hardness
he
knew
that
only
years
of
battling
had
taught
her
to
insist
even
so
little
on
her
rights
she
shrank
as
much
as
he
it
the
last
time
i
go
there
for
anything
she
declared
when
they
were
outside
the
place
thankful
to
be
clear
we
go
she
said
and
look
at
keep
and
boot
and
one
or
two
places
shall
we
they
had
discussions
over
the
pictures
and
morel
wanted
to
buy
him
a
little
sable
brush
that
he
hankered
after
but
this
indulgence
he
refused
he
stood
in
front
of
milliners
shops
and
drapers
shops
almost
bored
but
content
for
her
to
be
interested
they
wandered
on
now
just
look
at
those
black
grapes
she
said
they
make
your
mouth
water
i
wanted
some
of
those
for
years
but
i
s
have
to
wait
a
bit
before
i
get
then
she
rejoiced
in
the
florists
standing
in
the
doorway
sniffing
oh
oh
is
it
simply
lovely
paul
saw
in
the
darkness
of
the
shop
an
elegant
young
lady
in
black
peering
over
the
counter
curiously
they
looking
at
you
he
said
trying
to
draw
his
mother
away
but
what
is
it
she
exclaimed
refusing
to
be
moved
stocks
he
answered
sniffing
hastily
look
there
a
so
there
is
red
and
white
but
really
i
never
knew
stocks
to
smell
like
it
and
to
his
great
relief
she
moved
out
of
the
doorway
but
only
to
stand
in
front
of
the
window
paul
she
cried
to
him
who
was
trying
to
get
out
of
sight
of
the
elegant
young
lady
in
black
the
paul
just
look
here
he
came
reluctantly
back
now
just
look
at
that
fuchsia
she
exclaimed
pointing
h
he
made
a
curious
interested
sound
you
think
every
second
as
the
flowers
was
going
to
fall
off
they
hang
so
big
an
and
such
an
abundance
she
cried
and
the
way
they
drop
downwards
with
their
threads
and
knots
yes
she
exclaimed
lovely
i
wonder
who
buy
it
he
said
i
wonder
she
answered
not
it
would
die
in
our
yes
beastly
cold
sunless
hole
it
kills
every
bit
of
a
plant
you
put
in
and
the
kitchen
chokes
them
to
they
bought
a
few
things
and
set
off
towards
the
station
looking
up
the
canal
through
the
dark
pass
of
the
buildings
they
saw
the
castle
on
its
bluff
of
brown
rock
in
a
positive
miracle
of
delicate
sunshine
wo
it
be
nice
for
me
to
come
out
at
said
paul
i
can
go
all
round
here
and
see
everything
i
s
love
you
will
assented
his
mother
he
had
spent
a
perfect
afternoon
with
his
mother
they
arrived
home
in
the
mellow
evening
happy
and
glowing
and
tired
in
the
morning
he
filled
in
the
form
for
his
and
took
it
to
the
station
when
he
got
back
his
mother
was
just
beginning
to
wash
the
floor
he
sat
crouched
up
on
the
sofa
he
says
it
be
here
on
saturday
he
said
and
how
much
will
it
be
about
one
pound
eleven
he
said
she
went
on
washing
her
floor
in
silence
is
it
a
lot
he
asked
it
no
more
than
i
thought
she
answered
an
i
s
earn
eight
shillings
a
week
he
said
she
did
not
answer
but
went
on
with
her
work
at
last
she
said
that
william
promised
me
when
he
went
to
london
as
he
give
me
a
pound
a
month
he
has
given
me
ten
shillings
twice
and
now
i
know
he
has
a
farthing
if
i
asked
him
not
that
i
want
it
only
just
now
you
think
he
might
be
able
to
help
with
this
ticket
which
i
never
he
earns
a
lot
said
paul
he
earns
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
but
they
all
alike
large
in
promises
but
it
precious
little
fulfilment
you
he
spends
over
fifty
shillings
a
week
on
himself
said
paul
and
i
keep
this
house
on
less
than
thirty
she
replied
and
am
supposed
to
find
money
for
extras
but
they
do
care
about
helping
you
once
they
gone
he
rather
spend
it
on
that
she
should
have
her
own
money
if
she
so
grand
said
paul
she
should
but
she
has
i
asked
him
and
i
know
he
does
buy
her
a
gold
bangle
for
nothing
i
wonder
whoever
bought
me
a
gold
william
was
succeeding
with
his
gipsy
as
he
called
her
he
asked
the
girl
her
name
was
louisa
lily
denys
western
for
a
photograph
to
send
to
his
mother
the
photo
came
a
handsome
brunette
taken
in
profile
smirking
slightly
and
it
might
be
quite
naked
for
on
the
photograph
not
a
scrap
of
clothing
was
to
be
seen
only
a
naked
bust
yes
wrote
morel
to
her
son
the
photograph
of
louie
is
very
striking
and
i
can
see
she
must
be
attractive
but
do
you
think
my
boy
it
was
very
good
taste
of
a
girl
to
give
her
young
man
that
photo
to
send
to
his
mother
the
first
certainly
the
shoulders
are
beautiful
as
you
say
but
i
hardly
expected
to
see
so
much
of
them
at
the
first
morel
found
the
photograph
standing
on
the
chiffonier
in
the
parlour
he
came
out
with
it
between
his
thick
thumb
and
finger
who
dost
reckon
this
is
he
asked
of
his
wife
it
the
girl
our
william
is
going
with
replied
morel
h
a
bright
spark
from
th
look
on
an
one
as
wunna
do
him
owermuch
good
neither
who
is
she
her
name
is
louisa
lily
denys
an
come
again
exclaimed
the
miner
an
is
an
actress
she
is
not
she
supposed
to
be
a
i
bet
he
exclaimed
still
staring
at
the
photo
a
lady
is
she
an
how
much
does
she
reckon
ter
keep
up
this
sort
o
game
on
on
nothing
she
lives
with
an
old
aunt
whom
she
hates
and
takes
what
bit
of
money
given
h
said
morel
laying
down
the
photograph
then
he
a
fool
to
up
wi
such
a
one
as
dear
mater
william
replied
i
sorry
you
did
like
the
photograph
it
never
occurred
to
me
when
i
sent
it
that
you
think
it
decent
however
i
told
gyp
that
it
did
quite
suit
your
prim
and
proper
notions
so
she
going
to
send
you
another
that
i
hope
will
please
you
better
she
always
being
photographed
in
fact
the
photographers
ask
her
if
they
may
take
her
for
presently
the
new
photograph
came
with
a
little
silly
note
from
the
girl
this
time
the
young
lady
was
seen
in
a
black
satin
evening
bodice
cut
square
with
little
puff
sleeves
and
black
lace
hanging
down
her
beautiful
arms
i
wonder
if
she
ever
wears
anything
except
evening
clothes
said
morel
sarcastically
i
sure
i
ought
to
be
you
are
disagreeable
mother
said
paul
i
think
the
first
one
with
bare
shoulders
is
do
you
answered
his
mother
well
i
on
the
monday
morning
the
boy
got
up
at
six
to
start
work
he
had
the
which
had
cost
such
bitterness
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
he
loved
it
with
its
bars
of
yellow
across
his
mother
packed
his
dinner
in
a
small
basket
and
he
set
off
at
a
quarter
to
seven
to
catch
the
train
morel
came
to
the
to
see
him
off
it
was
a
perfect
morning
from
the
ash
tree
the
slender
green
fruits
that
the
children
call
pigeons
were
twinkling
gaily
down
on
a
little
breeze
into
the
front
gardens
of
the
houses
the
valley
was
full
of
a
lustrous
dark
haze
through
which
the
ripe
corn
shimmered
and
in
which
the
steam
from
minton
pit
melted
swiftly
puffs
of
wind
came
paul
looked
over
the
high
woods
of
aldersley
where
the
country
gleamed
and
home
had
never
pulled
at
him
so
powerfully
mother
he
said
smiling
but
feeling
very
unhappy
she
replied
cheerfully
and
tenderly
she
stood
in
her
white
apron
on
the
open
road
watching
him
as
he
crossed
the
field
he
had
a
small
compact
body
that
looked
full
of
life
she
felt
as
she
saw
him
trudging
over
the
field
that
where
he
determined
to
go
he
would
get
she
thought
of
william
he
would
have
leaped
the
fence
instead
of
going
round
the
stile
he
was
away
in
london
doing
well
paul
would
be
working
in
nottingham
now
she
had
two
sons
in
the
world
she
could
think
of
two
places
great
centres
of
industry
and
feel
that
she
had
put
a
man
into
each
of
them
that
these
men
would
work
out
what
she
wanted
they
were
derived
from
her
they
were
of
her
and
their
works
also
would
be
hers
all
the
morning
long
she
thought
of
paul
at
eight
he
climbed
the
dismal
stairs
of
jordan
surgical
appliance
factory
and
stood
helplessly
against
the
first
great
waiting
for
somebody
to
pick
him
up
the
place
was
still
not
awake
over
the
counters
were
great
dust
sheets
two
men
only
had
arrived
and
were
heard
talking
in
a
corner
as
they
took
off
their
coats
and
rolled
up
their
it
was
ten
past
eight
evidently
there
was
no
rush
of
punctuality
paul
listened
to
the
voices
of
the
two
clerks
then
he
heard
someone
cough
and
saw
in
the
office
at
the
end
of
the
room
an
old
decaying
clerk
in
a
round
of
black
velvet
embroidered
with
red
and
green
opening
letters
he
waited
and
waited
one
of
the
junior
clerks
went
to
the
old
man
greeted
him
cheerily
and
loudly
evidently
the
old
chief
was
deaf
then
the
young
fellow
came
striding
importantly
down
to
his
counter
he
spied
paul
hello
he
said
you
the
new
lad
yes
said
paul
h
what
your
name
paul
paul
morel
all
right
you
come
on
round
paul
followed
him
round
the
rectangle
of
counters
the
room
was
second
storey
it
had
a
great
hole
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
fenced
as
with
a
wall
of
counters
and
down
this
wide
shaft
the
lifts
went
and
the
light
for
the
bottom
storey
also
there
was
a
corresponding
big
oblong
hole
in
the
ceiling
and
one
could
see
above
over
the
fence
of
the
top
floor
some
machinery
and
right
away
overhead
was
the
glass
roof
and
all
light
for
the
three
storeys
came
downwards
getting
dimmer
so
that
it
was
always
night
on
the
ground
floor
and
rather
gloomy
on
the
second
floor
the
factory
was
the
top
floor
the
warehouse
the
second
the
storehouse
the
ground
floor
it
was
an
insanitary
ancient
place
paul
was
led
round
to
a
very
dark
corner
this
is
the
corner
said
the
clerk
you
spiral
with
pappleworth
he
your
boss
but
he
not
come
yet
he
does
get
here
till
eight
so
you
can
fetch
the
letters
if
you
like
from
melling
down
the
young
man
pointed
to
the
old
clerk
in
the
office
all
right
said
paul
here
a
peg
to
hang
your
cap
on
here
are
your
entry
ledgers
pappleworth
wo
be
and
the
thin
young
man
stalked
away
with
long
busy
strides
over
the
hollow
wooden
floor
after
a
minute
or
two
paul
went
down
and
stood
in
the
door
of
the
glass
office
the
old
clerk
in
the
looked
down
over
the
rim
of
his
spectacles
he
said
kindly
and
impressively
you
want
the
letters
for
the
spiral
department
thomas
paul
resented
being
called
thomas
but
he
took
the
letters
and
returned
to
his
dark
place
where
the
counter
made
an
angle
where
the
great
came
to
an
end
and
where
there
were
three
doors
in
the
corner
he
sat
on
a
high
stool
and
read
the
letters
those
whose
handwriting
was
not
too
difficult
they
ran
as
follows
will
you
please
send
me
at
once
a
pair
of
lady
silk
spiral
without
feet
such
as
i
had
from
you
last
year
length
thigh
to
knee
or
major
chamberlain
wishes
to
repeat
his
previous
order
for
a
silk
suspensory
many
of
these
letters
some
of
them
in
french
or
norwegian
were
a
great
puzzle
to
the
boy
he
sat
on
his
stool
nervously
awaiting
the
arrival
of
his
boss
he
suffered
tortures
of
shyness
when
at
eight
the
factory
girls
for
upstairs
trooped
past
him
pappleworth
arrived
chewing
a
chlorodyne
gum
at
about
twenty
to
nine
when
all
the
other
men
were
at
work
he
was
a
thin
sallow
man
with
a
red
nose
quick
staccato
and
smartly
but
stiffly
dressed
he
was
about
years
old
there
was
something
rather
doggy
rather
smart
rather
and
shrewd
and
something
warm
and
something
slightly
contemptible
about
him
you
my
new
lad
he
said
paul
stood
up
and
said
he
was
fetched
the
letters
pappleworth
gave
a
chew
to
his
gum
copied
well
come
on
then
let
look
slippy
changed
your
coat
you
want
to
bring
an
old
coat
and
leave
it
he
pronounced
the
last
words
with
the
chlorodyne
gum
between
his
side
teeth
he
vanished
into
the
darkness
behind
the
great
reappeared
coatless
turning
up
a
smart
striped
over
a
thin
and
hairy
arm
then
he
slipped
into
his
coat
paul
noticed
how
thin
he
was
and
that
his
trousers
were
in
folds
behind
he
seized
a
stool
dragged
it
beside
the
boy
and
sat
down
sit
down
he
said
paul
took
a
seat
pappleworth
was
very
close
to
him
the
man
seized
the
letters
snatched
a
long
out
of
a
rack
in
front
of
him
flung
it
open
seized
a
pen
and
said
now
look
here
you
want
to
copy
these
letters
in
he
sniffed
twice
gave
a
quick
chew
at
his
gum
stared
fixedly
at
a
letter
then
went
very
still
and
absorbed
and
wrote
the
entry
rapidly
in
a
beautiful
flourishing
hand
he
glanced
quickly
at
paul
see
that
think
you
can
do
it
all
right
all
right
then
let
see
he
sprang
off
his
stool
paul
took
a
pen
pappleworth
disappeared
paul
rather
liked
copying
the
letters
but
he
wrote
slowly
laboriously
and
exceedingly
badly
he
was
doing
the
fourth
letter
and
feeling
quite
busy
and
happy
when
pappleworth
reappeared
now
then
yer
getting
on
done
he
leaned
over
the
boy
shoulder
chewing
and
smelling
of
chlorodyne
strike
my
bob
lad
but
you
a
beautiful
writer
he
exclaimed
satirically
mind
how
many
done
only
three
i
eaten
get
on
my
lad
an
put
numbers
on
here
look
get
on
paul
ground
away
at
the
letters
whilst
pappleworth
fussed
over
various
jobs
suddenly
the
boy
started
as
a
shrill
whistle
sounded
near
his
ear
pappleworth
came
took
a
plug
out
of
a
pipe
and
said
in
an
amazingly
cross
and
bossy
voice
yes
paul
heard
a
faint
voice
like
a
woman
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
tube
he
gazed
in
wonder
never
having
seen
a
before
well
said
pappleworth
disagreeably
into
the
tube
you
better
get
some
of
your
back
work
done
again
the
woman
tiny
voice
was
heard
sounding
pretty
and
cross
i
not
time
to
stand
here
while
you
talk
said
pappleworth
and
he
pushed
the
plug
into
the
tube
come
my
lad
he
said
imploringly
to
paul
there
polly
crying
out
for
them
orders
ca
you
buck
up
a
bit
here
come
out
he
took
the
book
to
paul
immense
chagrin
and
began
the
copying
himself
he
worked
quickly
and
well
this
done
he
seized
some
strips
of
long
yellow
paper
about
three
inches
wide
and
made
out
the
orders
for
the
you
better
watch
me
he
said
to
paul
working
all
the
while
rapidly
paul
watched
the
weird
little
drawings
of
legs
and
thighs
and
ankles
with
the
strokes
across
and
the
numbers
and
the
few
brief
directions
which
his
chief
made
upon
the
yellow
paper
then
pappleworth
finished
and
jumped
up
come
on
with
me
he
said
and
the
yellow
papers
flying
in
his
hands
he
dashed
through
a
door
and
down
some
stairs
into
the
basement
where
the
gas
was
burning
they
crossed
the
cold
damp
storeroom
then
a
long
dreary
room
with
a
long
table
on
trestles
into
a
smaller
cosy
apartment
not
very
high
which
had
been
built
on
to
the
main
building
in
this
room
a
small
woman
with
a
red
serge
blouse
and
her
black
hair
done
on
top
of
her
head
was
waiting
like
a
proud
little
bantam
here
said
pappleworth
i
think
it
is
you
are
exclaimed
polly
the
girls
have
been
here
nearly
half
an
hour
waiting
just
think
of
the
time
wasted
you
think
of
getting
your
work
done
and
not
talking
so
much
said
pappleworth
you
could
ha
been
finishing
you
know
quite
well
we
finished
everything
off
on
saturday
cried
pony
flying
at
him
her
dark
eyes
flashing
he
mocked
here
your
new
lad
do
ruin
him
as
you
did
the
as
we
did
the
last
repeated
polly
yes
we
do
a
lot
of
ruining
we
do
my
word
a
lad
would
take
some
ruining
after
he
been
with
it
time
for
work
now
not
for
talk
said
pappleworth
severely
and
coldly
it
was
time
for
work
some
time
back
said
polly
marching
away
with
her
head
in
the
air
she
was
an
erect
little
body
of
forty
in
that
room
were
two
round
spiral
machines
on
the
bench
under
the
window
through
the
inner
doorway
was
another
longer
room
with
six
more
machines
a
little
group
of
girls
nicely
dressed
in
white
aprons
stood
talking
together
have
you
nothing
else
to
do
but
talk
said
pappleworth
only
wait
for
you
said
one
handsome
girl
laughing
well
get
on
get
on
he
said
come
on
my
lad
you
know
your
road
down
here
and
paul
ran
upstairs
after
his
chief
he
was
given
some
checking
and
invoicing
to
do
he
stood
at
the
desk
labouring
in
his
execrable
handwriting
presently
jordan
came
strutting
down
from
the
glass
office
and
stood
behind
him
to
the
boy
great
discomfort
suddenly
a
red
and
fat
finger
was
thrust
on
the
form
he
was
filling
in
mr
j
bates
esquire
exclaimed
the
cross
voice
just
behind
his
ear
paul
looked
at
mr
j
bates
esquire
in
his
own
vile
writing
and
wondered
what
was
the
matter
now
did
they
teach
you
any
better
than
that
while
they
were
at
it
if
you
put
you
do
put
man
ca
be
both
at
the
boy
regretted
his
generosity
in
disposing
of
honours
hesitated
and
with
trembling
fingers
scratched
out
the
then
all
at
once
jordan
snatched
away
the
invoice
make
another
are
you
going
to
send
that
to
a
gentleman
and
he
tore
up
the
blue
form
irritably
paul
his
ears
red
with
shame
began
again
still
jordan
watched
i
do
know
what
they
do
teach
in
schools
you
have
to
write
better
than
that
lads
learn
nothing
nowadays
but
how
to
recite
poetry
and
play
the
fiddle
have
you
seen
his
writing
he
asked
of
pappleworth
yes
prime
is
it
replied
pappleworth
indifferently
jordan
gave
a
little
grunt
not
unamiable
paul
divined
that
his
master
bark
was
worse
than
his
bite
indeed
the
little
manufacturer
although
he
spoke
bad
english
was
quite
gentleman
enough
to
leave
his
men
alone
and
to
take
no
notice
of
trifles
but
he
knew
he
did
not
look
like
the
boss
and
owner
of
the
show
so
he
had
to
play
his
role
of
proprietor
at
first
to
put
things
on
a
right
footing
let
see
what
your
name
asked
pappleworth
of
the
boy
paul
it
is
curious
that
children
suffer
so
much
at
having
to
pronounce
their
own
names
paul
morel
is
it
all
right
you
through
them
things
there
and
then
pappleworth
subsided
on
to
a
stool
and
began
writing
a
girl
came
up
from
out
of
a
door
just
behind
put
some
elastic
web
appliances
on
the
counter
and
returned
pappleworth
picked
up
the
examined
it
and
its
yellow
quickly
and
put
it
on
one
side
next
was
a
leg
he
went
through
the
few
things
wrote
out
a
couple
of
orders
and
called
to
paul
to
accompany
him
this
time
they
went
through
the
door
whence
the
girl
had
emerged
there
paul
found
himself
at
the
top
of
a
little
wooden
flight
of
steps
and
below
him
saw
a
room
with
windows
round
two
sides
and
at
the
farther
end
half
a
dozen
girls
sitting
bending
over
the
benches
in
the
light
from
the
window
sewing
they
were
singing
together
two
little
girls
in
blue
hearing
the
door
opened
they
all
turned
round
to
see
pappleworth
and
paul
looking
down
on
them
from
the
far
end
of
the
room
they
stopped
singing
ca
you
make
a
bit
less
row
said
pappleworth
folk
think
we
keep
a
hunchback
woman
on
a
high
stool
turned
her
long
rather
heavy
face
towards
pappleworth
and
said
in
a
contralto
voice
they
all
in
vain
pappleworth
tried
to
be
impressive
for
paul
benefit
he
descended
the
steps
into
the
room
and
went
to
the
hunchback
fanny
she
had
such
a
short
body
on
her
high
stool
that
her
head
with
its
great
bands
of
bright
brown
hair
seemed
over
large
as
did
her
pale
heavy
face
she
wore
a
dress
of
cashmere
and
her
wrists
coming
out
of
the
narrow
cuffs
were
thin
and
flat
as
she
put
down
her
work
nervously
he
showed
her
something
that
was
wrong
with
a
well
she
said
you
need
come
blaming
it
on
to
me
it
not
my
her
colour
mounted
to
her
cheek
i
never
said
it
was
your
fault
will
you
do
as
i
tell
you
replied
pappleworth
shortly
you
do
say
it
my
fault
but
you
like
to
make
out
as
it
was
the
hunchback
woman
cried
almost
in
tears
then
she
snatched
the
from
her
boss
saying
yes
i
do
it
for
you
but
you
need
be
here
your
new
lad
said
pappleworth
fanny
turned
smiling
very
gently
on
paul
oh
she
said
yes
do
make
a
softy
of
him
between
it
not
us
as
make
a
softy
of
him
she
said
indignantly
come
on
then
paul
said
pappleworth
au
revoy
paul
said
one
of
the
girls
there
was
a
titter
of
laughter
paul
went
out
blushing
deeply
not
having
spoken
a
word
the
day
was
very
long
all
morning
the
were
coming
to
speak
to
pappleworth
paul
was
writing
or
learning
to
make
up
parcels
ready
for
the
midday
post
at
one
or
rather
at
a
quarter
to
one
pappleworth
disappeared
to
catch
his
train
he
lived
in
the
suburbs
at
one
paul
feeling
very
lost
took
his
down
into
the
stockroom
in
the
basement
that
had
the
long
table
on
trestles
and
ate
his
meal
hurriedly
alone
in
that
cellar
of
gloom
and
desolation
then
he
went
out
of
doors
the
brightness
and
the
freedom
of
the
streets
made
him
feel
adventurous
and
happy
but
at
two
he
was
back
in
the
corner
of
the
big
room
soon
the
went
trooping
past
making
remarks
it
was
the
commoner
girls
who
worked
upstairs
at
the
heavy
tasks
of
and
the
finishing
of
artificial
limbs
he
waited
for
pappleworth
not
knowing
what
to
do
sitting
scribbling
on
the
yellow
pappleworth
came
at
twenty
minutes
to
three
then
he
sat
and
gossiped
with
paul
treating
the
boy
entirely
as
an
equal
even
in
age
in
the
afternoon
there
was
never
very
much
to
do
unless
it
were
near
the
and
the
accounts
had
to
be
made
up
at
five
all
the
men
went
down
into
the
dungeon
with
the
table
on
trestles
and
there
they
had
tea
eating
on
the
bare
dirty
boards
talking
with
the
same
kind
of
ugly
haste
and
slovenliness
with
which
they
ate
their
meal
and
yet
upstairs
the
atmosphere
among
them
was
always
jolly
and
clear
the
cellar
and
the
trestles
affected
them
after
tea
when
all
the
gases
were
lighted
work
went
more
briskly
there
was
the
big
evening
post
to
get
off
the
hose
came
up
warm
and
newly
pressed
from
the
workrooms
paul
had
made
out
the
invoices
now
he
had
the
packing
up
and
addressing
to
do
then
he
had
to
weigh
his
stock
of
parcels
on
the
scales
everywhere
voices
were
calling
weights
there
was
the
chink
of
metal
the
rapid
snapping
of
string
the
hurrying
to
old
melling
for
stamps
and
at
last
the
postman
came
with
his
sack
laughing
and
jolly
then
everything
slacked
off
and
paul
took
his
and
ran
to
the
station
to
catch
the
train
the
day
in
the
factory
was
just
twelve
hours
long
his
mother
sat
waiting
for
him
rather
anxiously
he
had
to
walk
from
keston
so
was
not
home
until
about
twenty
past
nine
and
he
left
the
house
before
seven
in
the
morning
morel
was
rather
anxious
about
his
health
but
she
herself
had
had
to
put
up
with
so
much
that
she
expected
her
children
to
take
the
same
odds
they
must
go
through
with
what
came
and
paul
stayed
at
jordan
although
all
the
time
he
was
there
his
health
suffered
from
the
darkness
and
lack
of
air
and
the
long
hours
he
came
in
pale
and
tired
his
mother
looked
at
him
she
saw
he
was
rather
pleased
and
her
anxiety
all
went
well
and
how
was
it
she
asked
ever
so
funny
mother
he
replied
you
do
have
to
work
a
bit
hard
and
they
nice
with
and
did
you
get
on
all
right
yes
they
only
say
my
writing
bad
but
pappleworth
he
my
man
said
to
jordan
i
should
be
all
right
i
spiral
mother
you
must
come
and
see
it
ever
so
soon
he
liked
jordan
pappleworth
who
had
a
certain
saloon
bar
flavour
about
him
was
always
natural
and
treated
him
as
if
he
had
been
a
comrade
sometimes
the
spiral
boss
was
irritable
and
chewed
more
lozenges
than
ever
even
then
however
he
was
not
offensive
but
one
of
those
people
who
hurt
themselves
by
their
own
irritability
more
than
they
hurt
other
people
have
you
done
that
yet
he
would
cry
go
on
be
a
month
of
again
and
paul
could
understand
him
least
then
he
was
jocular
and
in
high
spirits
i
going
to
bring
my
little
yorkshire
terrier
bitch
tomorrow
he
said
jubilantly
to
paul
what
a
yorkshire
terrier
do
know
what
a
yorkshire
terrier
is
do
know
a
yorkshire
pappleworth
was
aghast
is
it
a
little
silky
one
colours
of
iron
and
rusty
silver
that
it
my
lad
she
a
gem
she
had
five
pounds
worth
of
pups
already
and
she
worth
over
seven
pounds
herself
and
she
weigh
twenty
the
next
day
the
bitch
came
she
was
a
shivering
miserable
morsel
paul
did
not
care
for
her
she
seemed
so
like
a
wet
rag
that
would
never
dry
then
a
man
called
for
her
and
began
to
make
coarse
jokes
but
pappleworth
nodded
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
boy
and
the
talk
went
on
jordan
only
made
one
more
excursion
to
watch
paul
and
then
the
only
fault
he
found
was
seeing
the
boy
lay
his
pen
on
the
counter
put
your
pen
in
your
ear
if
you
going
to
be
a
clerk
pen
in
your
ear
and
one
day
he
said
to
the
lad
why
do
you
hold
your
shoulders
straighter
come
down
here
when
he
took
him
into
the
glass
office
and
fitted
him
with
special
braces
for
keeping
the
shoulders
square
but
paul
liked
the
girls
best
the
men
seemed
common
and
rather
dull
he
liked
them
all
but
they
were
uninteresting
polly
the
little
brisk
overseer
downstairs
finding
paul
eating
in
the
cellar
asked
him
if
she
could
cook
him
anything
on
her
little
stove
next
day
his
mother
gave
him
a
dish
that
could
be
heated
up
he
took
it
into
the
pleasant
clean
room
to
polly
and
very
soon
it
grew
to
be
an
established
custom
that
he
should
have
dinner
with
her
when
he
came
in
at
eight
in
the
morning
he
took
his
basket
to
her
and
when
he
came
down
at
one
she
had
his
dinner
ready
he
was
not
very
tall
and
pale
with
thick
chestnut
hair
irregular
features
and
a
wide
full
mouth
she
was
like
a
small
bird
he
often
called
her
a
robinet
though
naturally
rather
quiet
he
would
sit
and
chatter
with
her
for
hours
telling
her
about
his
home
the
girls
all
liked
to
hear
him
talk
they
often
gathered
in
a
little
circle
while
he
sat
on
a
bench
and
held
forth
to
them
laughing
some
of
them
regarded
him
as
a
curious
little
creature
so
serious
yet
so
bright
and
jolly
and
always
so
delicate
in
his
way
with
them
they
all
liked
him
and
he
adored
them
polly
he
felt
he
belonged
to
then
connie
with
her
mane
of
red
hair
her
face
of
her
murmuring
voice
such
a
lady
in
her
shabby
black
frock
appealed
to
his
romantic
side
when
you
sit
winding
he
said
it
looks
as
if
you
were
spinning
at
a
it
looks
ever
so
nice
you
remind
me
of
elaine
in
the
of
the
king
i
draw
you
if
i
and
she
glanced
at
him
blushing
shyly
and
later
on
he
had
a
sketch
he
prized
very
much
connie
sitting
on
the
stool
before
the
wheel
her
flowing
mane
of
red
hair
on
her
rusty
black
frock
her
red
mouth
shut
and
serious
running
the
scarlet
thread
off
the
hank
on
to
the
reel
with
louie
handsome
and
brazen
who
always
seemed
to
thrust
her
hip
at
him
he
usually
joked
emma
was
rather
plain
rather
old
and
condescending
but
to
condescend
to
him
made
her
happy
and
he
did
not
mind
how
do
you
put
needles
in
he
asked
go
away
and
do
but
i
ought
to
know
how
to
put
needles
she
ground
at
her
machine
all
the
while
steadily
there
are
many
things
you
ought
to
know
she
replied
tell
me
then
how
to
stick
needles
in
the
oh
the
boy
what
a
nuisance
he
is
why
this
is
how
you
do
he
watched
her
attentively
suddenly
a
whistle
piped
then
polly
appeared
and
said
in
a
clear
voice
mr
pappleworth
wants
to
know
how
much
longer
you
going
to
be
down
here
playing
with
the
girls
paul
flew
upstairs
calling
and
emma
drew
herself
up
it
was
me
who
wanted
him
to
play
with
the
machine
she
said
as
a
rule
when
all
the
girls
came
back
at
two
he
ran
upstairs
to
fanny
the
hunchback
in
the
room
pappleworth
did
not
appear
till
twenty
to
three
and
he
often
found
his
boy
sitting
beside
fanny
talking
or
drawing
or
singing
with
the
girls
often
after
a
minute
hesitation
fanny
would
begin
to
sing
she
had
a
fine
contralto
voice
everybody
joined
in
the
chorus
and
it
went
well
paul
was
not
at
all
embarrassed
after
a
while
sitting
in
the
room
with
the
half
a
dozen
at
the
end
of
the
song
fanny
would
say
i
know
you
been
laughing
at
do
be
so
soft
fanny
cried
one
of
the
girls
once
there
was
mention
of
connie
red
hair
fanny
is
better
to
my
fancy
said
emma
you
need
try
to
make
a
fool
of
me
said
fanny
flushing
deeply
no
but
she
has
paul
she
got
beautiful
it
a
treat
of
a
colour
said
he
that
coldish
colour
like
earth
and
yet
shiny
it
like
goodness
me
exclaimed
one
girl
laughing
how
i
do
but
get
criticised
said
fanny
but
you
should
see
it
down
paul
cried
emma
earnestly
it
simply
beautiful
put
it
down
for
him
fanny
if
he
wants
something
to
fanny
would
not
and
yet
she
wanted
to
then
i
take
it
down
myself
said
the
lad
well
you
can
if
you
like
said
fanny
and
he
carefully
took
the
pins
out
of
the
knot
and
the
rush
of
hair
of
uniform
dark
brown
slid
over
the
humped
back
what
a
lovely
lot
he
exclaimed
the
girls
watched
there
was
silence
the
youth
shook
the
hair
loose
from
the
coil
it
splendid
he
said
smelling
its
perfume
i
bet
it
worth
i
leave
it
you
when
i
die
paul
said
fanny
half
joking
you
look
just
like
anybody
else
sitting
drying
their
hair
said
one
of
the
girls
to
the
hunchback
poor
fanny
was
morbidly
sensitive
always
imagining
insults
polly
was
curt
and
businesslike
the
two
departments
were
for
ever
at
war
and
paul
was
always
finding
fanny
in
tears
then
he
was
made
the
recipient
of
all
her
woes
and
he
had
to
plead
her
case
with
polly
so
the
time
went
along
happily
enough
the
factory
had
a
homely
feel
no
one
was
rushed
or
driven
paul
always
enjoyed
it
when
the
work
got
faster
towards
and
all
the
men
united
in
labour
he
liked
to
watch
his
at
work
the
man
was
the
work
and
the
work
was
the
man
one
thing
for
the
time
being
it
was
different
with
the
girls
the
real
woman
never
seemed
to
be
there
at
the
task
but
as
if
left
out
waiting
from
the
train
going
home
at
night
he
used
to
watch
the
lights
of
the
town
sprinkled
thick
on
the
hills
fusing
together
in
a
blaze
in
the
valleys
he
felt
rich
in
life
and
happy
drawing
farther
off
there
was
a
patch
of
lights
at
bulwell
like
myriad
petals
shaken
to
the
ground
from
the
shed
stars
and
beyond
was
the
red
glare
of
the
furnaces
playing
like
hot
breath
on
the
clouds
he
had
to
walk
two
and
more
miles
from
keston
home
up
two
long
hills
down
two
short
hills
he
was
often
tired
and
he
counted
the
lamps
climbing
the
hill
above
him
how
many
more
to
pass
and
from
the
hilltop
on
nights
he
looked
round
on
the
villages
five
or
six
miles
away
that
shone
like
swarms
of
glittering
living
things
almost
a
heaven
against
his
feet
marlpool
and
heanor
scattered
the
darkness
with
brilliance
and
occasionally
the
black
valley
space
between
was
traced
violated
by
a
great
train
rushing
south
to
london
or
north
to
scotland
the
trains
roared
by
like
projectiles
level
on
the
darkness
fuming
and
burning
making
the
valley
clang
with
their
passage
they
were
gone
and
the
lights
of
the
towns
and
villages
glittered
in
silence
and
then
he
came
to
the
corner
at
home
which
faced
the
other
side
of
the
night
the
seemed
a
friend
now
his
mother
rose
with
gladness
as
he
entered
he
put
his
eight
shillings
proudly
on
the
table
it
help
mother
he
asked
wistfully
there
precious
little
left
she
answered
after
your
ticket
and
dinners
and
such
are
taken
then
he
told
her
the
budget
of
the
day
his
like
an
arabian
nights
was
told
night
after
night
to
his
mother
it
was
almost
as
if
it
were
her
own
life
chapter
vi
death
in
the
family
arthur
morel
was
growing
up
he
was
a
quick
careless
impulsive
boy
a
good
deal
like
his
father
he
hated
study
made
a
great
moan
if
he
had
to
work
and
escaped
as
soon
as
possible
to
his
sport
again
in
appearance
he
remained
the
flower
of
the
family
being
well
made
graceful
and
full
of
life
his
dark
brown
hair
and
fresh
colouring
and
his
exquisite
dark
blue
eyes
shaded
with
long
lashes
together
with
his
generous
manner
and
fiery
temper
made
him
a
favourite
but
as
he
grew
older
his
temper
became
uncertain
he
flew
into
rages
over
nothing
seemed
unbearably
raw
and
irritable
his
mother
whom
he
loved
wearied
of
him
sometimes
he
thought
only
of
himself
when
he
wanted
amusement
all
that
stood
in
his
way
he
hated
even
if
it
were
she
when
he
was
in
trouble
he
moaned
to
her
ceaselessly
goodness
boy
she
said
when
he
groaned
about
a
master
who
he
said
hated
him
if
you
do
like
it
alter
it
and
if
you
ca
alter
it
put
up
with
and
his
father
whom
he
had
loved
and
who
had
worshipped
him
he
came
to
detest
as
he
grew
older
morel
fell
into
a
slow
ruin
his
body
which
had
been
beautiful
in
movement
and
in
being
shrank
did
not
seem
to
ripen
with
the
years
but
to
get
mean
and
rather
despicable
there
came
over
him
a
look
of
meanness
and
of
paltriness
and
when
the
elderly
man
bullied
or
ordered
the
boy
about
arthur
was
furious
moreover
morel
manners
got
worse
and
worse
his
habits
somewhat
disgusting
when
the
children
were
growing
up
and
in
the
crucial
stage
of
adolescence
the
father
was
like
some
ugly
irritant
to
their
souls
his
manners
in
the
house
were
the
same
as
he
used
among
the
colliers
down
pit
dirty
nuisance
arthur
would
cry
jumping
up
and
going
straight
out
of
the
house
when
his
father
disgusted
him
and
morel
persisted
the
more
because
his
children
hated
it
he
seemed
to
take
a
kind
of
satisfaction
in
disgusting
them
and
driving
them
nearly
mad
while
they
were
so
irritably
sensitive
at
the
age
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
so
that
arthur
who
was
growing
up
when
his
father
was
degenerate
and
elderly
hated
him
worst
of
all
then
sometimes
the
father
would
seem
to
feel
the
contemptuous
hatred
of
his
children
there
not
a
man
tries
harder
for
his
family
he
would
shout
he
does
his
best
for
them
and
then
gets
treated
like
a
dog
but
i
not
going
to
stand
it
i
tell
you
but
for
the
threat
and
the
fact
that
he
did
not
try
so
hard
as
he
imagined
they
would
have
felt
sorry
as
it
was
the
battle
now
went
on
nearly
all
between
father
and
children
he
persisting
in
his
dirty
and
disgusting
ways
just
to
assert
his
independence
they
loathed
him
arthur
was
so
inflamed
and
irritable
at
last
that
when
he
won
a
scholarship
for
the
grammar
school
in
nottingham
his
mother
decided
to
let
him
live
in
town
with
one
of
her
sisters
and
only
come
home
at
annie
was
still
a
junior
teacher
in
the
earning
about
four
shillings
a
week
but
soon
she
would
have
fifteen
shillings
since
she
had
passed
her
examination
and
there
would
be
financial
peace
in
the
house
morel
clung
now
to
paul
he
was
quiet
and
not
brilliant
but
still
he
stuck
to
his
painting
and
still
he
stuck
to
his
mother
everything
he
did
was
for
her
she
waited
for
his
coming
home
in
the
evening
and
then
she
unburdened
herself
of
all
she
had
pondered
or
of
all
that
had
occurred
to
her
during
the
day
he
sat
and
listened
with
his
earnestness
the
two
shared
lives
william
was
engaged
now
to
his
brunette
and
had
bought
her
an
engagement
ring
that
cost
eight
guineas
the
children
gasped
at
such
a
fabulous
price
eight
guineas
said
morel
more
fool
him
if
he
gen
me
some
o
it
ha
looked
better
on
given
you
some
of
it
cried
morel
why
give
you
some
of
it
she
remembered
he
had
bought
no
engagement
ring
at
all
and
she
preferred
william
who
was
not
mean
if
he
were
foolish
but
now
the
young
man
talked
only
of
the
dances
to
which
he
went
with
his
betrothed
and
the
different
resplendent
clothes
she
wore
or
he
told
his
mother
with
glee
how
they
went
to
the
theatre
like
great
swells
he
wanted
to
bring
the
girl
home
morel
said
she
should
come
at
the
christmas
this
time
william
arrived
with
a
lady
but
with
no
presents
morel
had
prepared
supper
hearing
footsteps
she
rose
and
went
to
the
door
william
entered
hello
mother
he
kissed
her
hastily
then
stood
aside
to
present
a
tall
handsome
girl
who
was
wearing
a
costume
of
fine
check
and
furs
here
gyp
miss
western
held
out
her
hand
and
showed
her
teeth
in
a
small
smile
oh
how
do
you
do
morel
she
exclaimed
i
am
afraid
you
will
be
hungry
said
morel
oh
no
we
had
dinner
in
the
train
have
you
got
my
gloves
chubby
william
morel
big
and
looked
at
her
quickly
how
should
i
he
said
then
i
lost
them
do
be
cross
with
a
frown
went
over
his
face
but
he
said
nothing
she
glanced
round
the
kitchen
it
was
small
and
curious
to
her
with
its
glittering
its
evergreens
behind
the
pictures
its
wooden
chairs
and
little
deal
table
at
that
moment
morel
came
in
hello
dad
hello
my
son
tha
let
on
me
the
two
shook
hands
and
william
presented
the
lady
she
gave
the
same
smile
that
showed
her
teeth
how
do
you
do
morel
morel
bowed
obsequiously
i
very
well
and
i
hope
so
are
you
you
must
make
yourself
very
oh
thank
you
she
replied
rather
amused
you
will
like
to
go
upstairs
said
morel
if
you
do
mind
but
not
if
it
is
any
trouble
to
it
is
no
trouble
annie
will
take
you
walter
carry
up
this
and
do
be
an
hour
dressing
yourself
up
said
william
to
his
betrothed
annie
took
a
brass
candlestick
and
too
shy
almost
to
speak
preceded
the
young
lady
to
the
front
bedroom
which
and
morel
had
vacated
for
her
it
too
was
small
and
cold
by
candlelight
the
colliers
wives
only
lit
fires
in
bedrooms
in
case
of
extreme
illness
shall
i
unstrap
the
box
asked
annie
oh
thank
you
very
much
annie
played
the
part
of
maid
then
went
downstairs
for
hot
water
i
think
she
rather
tired
mother
said
william
it
a
beastly
journey
and
we
had
such
a
is
there
anything
i
can
give
her
asked
morel
oh
no
she
be
all
but
there
was
a
chill
in
the
atmosphere
after
half
an
hour
miss
western
came
down
having
put
on
a
dress
very
fine
for
the
collier
kitchen
i
told
you
you
no
need
to
change
said
william
to
her
oh
chubby
then
she
turned
with
that
sweetish
smile
to
morel
do
you
think
he
always
grumbling
morel
is
he
said
morel
that
not
very
nice
of
it
is
really
you
are
cold
said
the
mother
wo
you
come
near
the
fire
morel
jumped
out
of
his
armchair
come
and
sit
you
here
he
cried
come
and
sit
you
here
no
dad
keep
your
own
chair
sit
on
the
sofa
gyp
said
william
no
no
cried
morel
this
cheer
warmest
come
and
sit
here
miss
thank
you
so
much
said
the
girl
seating
herself
in
the
armchair
the
place
of
honour
she
shivered
feeling
the
warmth
of
the
kitchen
penetrate
her
fetch
me
a
hanky
chubby
dear
she
said
putting
up
her
mouth
to
him
and
using
the
same
intimate
tone
as
if
they
were
alone
which
made
the
rest
of
the
family
feel
as
if
they
ought
not
to
be
present
the
young
lady
evidently
did
not
realise
them
as
people
they
were
creatures
to
her
for
the
present
william
winced
in
such
a
household
in
streatham
miss
western
would
have
been
a
lady
condescending
to
her
inferiors
these
people
were
to
her
certainly
clownish
in
short
the
working
classes
how
was
she
to
adjust
herself
i
go
said
annie
miss
western
took
no
notice
as
if
a
servant
had
spoken
but
when
the
girl
came
downstairs
again
with
the
handkerchief
she
said
oh
thank
you
in
a
gracious
way
she
sat
and
talked
about
the
dinner
on
the
train
which
had
been
so
poor
about
london
about
dances
she
was
really
very
nervous
and
chattered
from
fear
morel
sat
all
the
time
smoking
his
thick
twist
tobacco
watching
her
and
listening
to
her
glib
london
speech
as
he
puffed
morel
dressed
up
in
her
best
black
silk
blouse
answered
quietly
and
rather
briefly
the
three
children
sat
round
in
silence
and
admiration
miss
western
was
the
princess
everything
of
the
best
was
got
out
for
her
the
best
cups
the
best
spoons
the
best
table
cloth
the
best
the
children
thought
she
must
find
it
quite
grand
she
felt
strange
not
able
to
realise
the
people
not
knowing
how
to
treat
them
william
joked
and
was
slightly
uncomfortable
at
about
ten
he
said
to
her
are
you
tired
gyp
rather
chubby
she
answered
at
once
in
the
intimate
tones
and
putting
her
head
slightly
on
one
side
i
light
her
the
candle
mother
he
said
very
well
replied
the
mother
miss
western
stood
up
held
out
her
hand
to
morel
morel
she
said
paul
sat
at
the
boiler
letting
the
water
run
from
the
tap
into
a
stone
annie
swathed
the
bottle
in
an
old
flannel
and
kissed
her
mother
she
was
to
share
the
room
with
the
lady
because
the
house
was
full
you
wait
a
minute
said
morel
to
annie
and
annie
sat
nursing
the
bottle
miss
western
shook
hands
all
round
to
discomfort
and
took
her
departure
preceded
by
william
in
five
minutes
he
was
downstairs
again
his
heart
was
rather
sore
he
did
not
know
why
he
talked
very
little
till
everybody
had
gone
to
bed
but
himself
and
his
mother
then
he
stood
with
his
legs
apart
in
his
old
attitude
on
the
hearthrug
and
said
hesitatingly
well
mother
well
my
son
she
sat
in
the
feeling
somehow
hurt
and
humiliated
for
his
sake
do
you
like
her
yes
came
the
slow
answer
she
shy
yet
mother
she
not
used
to
it
it
different
from
her
aunt
house
you
of
course
it
is
my
boy
and
she
must
find
it
she
then
he
frowned
swiftly
if
only
she
would
put
on
her
blessed
airs
it
only
her
first
awkwardness
my
boy
she
be
all
that
it
mother
he
replied
gratefully
but
his
brow
was
gloomy
you
know
she
not
like
you
mother
she
not
serious
and
she
she
young
my
yes
and
she
had
no
sort
of
show
her
mother
died
when
she
was
a
child
since
then
she
lived
with
her
aunt
whom
she
ca
bear
and
her
father
was
a
rake
she
had
no
no
well
you
must
make
up
to
and
so
you
have
to
forgive
her
a
lot
of
what
do
you
have
to
forgive
her
my
boy
i
dunno
when
she
seems
shallow
you
have
to
remember
she
never
had
anybody
to
bring
her
deeper
side
out
and
she
fearfully
fond
of
anybody
can
see
but
you
know
mother
she
she
different
from
us
those
sort
of
people
like
those
she
lives
amongst
they
do
seem
to
have
the
same
you
must
judge
too
hastily
said
morel
but
he
seemed
uneasy
within
himself
in
the
morning
however
he
was
up
singing
and
larking
round
the
house
hello
he
called
sitting
on
the
stairs
are
you
getting
up
yes
her
voice
called
faintly
merry
christmas
he
shouted
to
her
her
laugh
pretty
and
tinkling
was
heard
in
the
bedroom
she
did
not
come
down
in
half
an
hour
was
she
really
getting
up
when
she
said
she
was
he
asked
of
annie
yes
she
was
replied
annie
he
waited
a
while
then
went
to
the
stairs
again
happy
new
year
he
called
thank
you
chubby
dear
came
the
laughing
voice
far
away
buck
up
he
implored
it
was
nearly
an
hour
and
still
he
was
waiting
for
her
morel
who
always
rose
before
six
looked
at
the
clock
well
it
a
winder
he
exclaimed
the
family
had
breakfasted
all
but
william
he
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
shall
i
have
to
send
you
an
easter
egg
up
there
he
called
rather
crossly
she
only
laughed
the
family
expected
after
that
time
of
preparation
something
like
magic
at
last
she
came
looking
very
nice
in
a
blouse
and
skirt
have
you
really
been
all
this
time
getting
ready
he
asked
chubby
dear
that
question
is
not
permitted
is
it
morel
she
played
the
grand
lady
at
first
when
she
went
with
william
to
chapel
he
in
his
and
silk
hat
she
in
her
furs
and
costume
paul
and
arthur
and
annie
expected
everybody
to
bow
to
the
ground
in
admiration
and
morel
standing
in
his
sunday
suit
at
the
end
of
the
road
watching
the
gallant
pair
go
felt
he
was
the
father
of
princes
and
princesses
and
yet
she
was
not
so
grand
for
a
year
now
she
had
been
a
sort
of
secretary
or
clerk
in
a
london
office
but
while
she
was
with
the
morels
she
queened
it
she
sat
and
let
annie
or
paul
wait
on
her
as
if
they
were
her
servants
she
treated
morel
with
a
certain
glibness
and
morel
with
patronage
but
after
a
day
or
so
she
began
to
change
her
tune
william
always
wanted
paul
or
annie
to
go
along
with
them
on
their
walks
it
was
so
much
more
interesting
and
paul
really
did
admire
gipsy
wholeheartedly
in
fact
his
mother
scarcely
forgave
the
boy
for
the
adulation
with
which
he
treated
the
girl
on
the
second
day
when
lily
said
oh
annie
do
you
know
where
i
left
my
muff
william
replied
you
know
it
is
in
your
bedroom
why
do
you
ask
annie
and
lily
went
upstairs
with
a
cross
shut
mouth
but
it
angered
the
young
man
that
she
made
a
servant
of
his
sister
on
the
third
evening
william
and
lily
were
sitting
together
in
the
parlour
by
the
fire
in
the
dark
at
a
quarter
to
eleven
morel
was
heard
raking
the
fire
william
came
out
to
the
kitchen
followed
by
his
beloved
is
it
as
late
as
that
mother
he
said
she
had
been
sitting
alone
it
is
not
late
my
boy
but
it
is
as
late
as
i
usually
sit
wo
you
go
to
bed
then
he
asked
and
leave
you
two
no
my
boy
i
do
believe
in
ca
you
trust
us
mother
whether
i
can
or
not
i
wo
do
it
you
can
stay
till
eleven
if
you
like
and
i
can
go
to
bed
gyp
he
said
to
his
girl
we
wo
keep
mater
annie
has
left
the
candle
burning
lily
said
morel
i
think
you
will
yes
thank
you
william
kissed
his
sweetheart
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
and
she
went
he
returned
to
the
kitchen
ca
you
trust
us
mother
he
repeated
rather
offended
my
boy
i
tell
you
i
do
believe
in
leaving
two
young
things
like
you
alone
downstairs
when
everyone
else
is
in
and
he
was
forced
to
take
this
answer
he
kissed
his
mother
at
easter
he
came
over
alone
and
then
he
discussed
his
sweetheart
endlessly
with
his
mother
you
know
mother
when
i
away
from
her
i
do
care
for
her
a
bit
i
should
care
if
i
never
saw
her
again
but
then
when
i
with
her
in
the
evenings
i
am
awfully
fond
of
it
a
queer
sort
of
love
to
marry
on
said
morel
if
she
holds
you
no
more
than
that
it
is
funny
he
exclaimed
it
worried
and
perplexed
him
but
yet
there
so
much
between
us
now
i
could
give
her
you
know
best
said
morel
but
if
it
is
as
you
say
i
call
it
love
at
any
rate
it
does
look
much
like
oh
i
do
know
mother
she
an
orphan
and
they
never
came
to
any
sort
of
conclusion
he
seemed
puzzled
and
rather
fretted
she
was
rather
reserved
all
his
strength
and
money
went
in
keeping
this
girl
he
could
scarcely
afford
to
take
his
mother
to
nottingham
when
he
came
over
paul
wages
had
been
raised
at
christmas
to
ten
shillings
to
his
great
joy
he
was
quite
happy
at
jordan
but
his
health
suffered
from
the
long
hours
and
the
confinement
his
mother
to
whom
he
became
more
and
more
significant
thought
how
to
help
his
holiday
was
on
monday
afternoon
on
a
monday
morning
in
may
as
the
two
sat
alone
at
breakfast
she
said
i
think
it
will
be
a
fine
he
looked
up
in
surprise
this
meant
something
you
know
leivers
has
gone
to
live
on
a
new
farm
well
he
asked
me
last
week
if
i
would
go
and
see
leivers
and
i
promised
to
bring
you
on
monday
if
it
fine
shall
we
go
i
say
little
woman
how
lovely
he
cried
and
we
go
this
afternoon
paul
hurried
off
to
the
station
jubilant
down
derby
road
was
a
that
glistened
the
old
brick
wall
by
the
statutes
ground
burned
scarlet
spring
was
a
very
flame
of
green
and
the
steep
swoop
of
highroad
lay
in
its
cool
morning
dust
splendid
with
patterns
of
sunshine
and
shadow
perfectly
still
the
trees
sloped
their
great
green
shoulders
proudly
and
inside
the
warehouse
all
the
morning
the
boy
had
a
vision
of
spring
outside
when
he
came
home
at
his
mother
was
rather
excited
are
we
going
he
asked
when
i
ready
she
replied
presently
he
got
up
go
and
get
dressed
while
i
wash
up
he
said
she
did
so
he
washed
the
pots
straightened
and
then
took
her
boots
they
were
quite
clean
morel
was
one
of
those
naturally
exquisite
people
who
can
walk
in
mud
without
dirtying
their
shoes
but
paul
had
to
clean
them
for
her
they
were
kid
boots
at
eight
shillings
a
pair
he
however
thought
them
the
most
dainty
boots
in
the
world
and
he
cleaned
them
with
as
much
reverence
as
if
they
had
been
flowers
suddenly
she
appeared
in
the
inner
doorway
rather
shyly
she
had
got
a
new
cotton
blouse
on
paul
jumped
up
and
went
forward
oh
my
stars
he
exclaimed
what
a
she
sniffed
in
a
little
haughty
way
and
put
her
head
up
it
not
a
at
all
she
replied
it
very
she
walked
forward
whilst
he
hovered
round
her
well
she
asked
quite
shy
but
pretending
to
be
high
and
mighty
do
you
like
it
awfully
you
are
a
fine
little
woman
to
go
jaunting
out
with
he
went
and
surveyed
her
from
the
back
well
he
said
if
i
was
walking
down
the
street
behind
you
i
should
say
that
little
person
fancy
herself
well
she
does
replied
morel
she
not
sure
it
suits
oh
no
she
wants
to
be
in
dirty
black
looking
as
if
she
was
wrapped
in
burnt
paper
it
does
suit
you
and
i
say
you
look
she
sniffed
in
her
little
way
pleased
but
pretending
to
know
better
well
she
said
it
cost
me
just
three
shillings
you
could
have
got
it
for
that
price
could
you
i
should
think
you
could
he
replied
and
you
know
it
good
awfully
pretty
he
said
the
blouse
was
white
with
a
little
sprig
of
heliotrope
and
black
too
young
for
me
though
i
afraid
she
said
too
young
for
you
he
exclaimed
in
disgust
why
do
you
buy
some
false
white
hair
and
stick
it
on
your
i
s
soon
have
no
need
she
replied
i
going
white
fast
well
you
no
business
to
he
said
what
do
i
want
with
a
mother
i
afraid
you
have
to
put
up
with
one
my
lad
she
said
rather
strangely
they
set
off
in
great
style
she
carrying
the
umbrella
william
had
given
her
because
of
the
sun
paul
was
considerably
taller
than
she
though
he
was
not
big
he
fancied
himself
on
the
fallow
land
the
young
wheat
shone
silkily
minton
pit
waved
its
plumes
of
white
steam
coughed
and
rattled
hoarsely
now
look
at
that
said
morel
mother
and
son
stood
on
the
road
to
watch
along
the
ridge
of
the
great
crawled
a
little
group
in
silhouette
against
the
sky
a
horse
a
small
truck
and
a
man
they
climbed
the
incline
against
the
heavens
at
the
end
the
man
tipped
the
wagon
there
was
an
undue
rattle
as
the
waste
fell
down
the
sheer
slope
of
the
enormous
bank
you
sit
a
minute
mother
he
said
and
she
took
a
seat
on
a
bank
whilst
he
sketched
rapidly
she
was
silent
whilst
he
worked
looking
round
at
the
afternoon
the
red
cottages
shining
among
their
greenness
the
world
is
a
wonderful
place
she
said
and
wonderfully
and
so
the
pit
he
said
look
how
it
heaps
together
like
something
alive
almost
a
big
creature
that
you
do
yes
she
said
perhaps
and
all
the
trucks
standing
waiting
like
a
string
of
beasts
to
be
fed
he
said
and
very
thankful
i
am
they
are
standing
she
said
for
that
means
they
turn
middling
time
this
but
i
like
the
feel
of
men
on
things
while
they
alive
there
a
feel
of
men
about
trucks
because
they
been
handled
with
men
hands
all
of
yes
said
morel
they
went
along
under
the
trees
of
the
highroad
he
was
constantly
informing
her
but
she
was
interested
they
passed
the
end
of
nethermere
that
was
tossing
its
sunshine
like
petals
lightly
in
its
lap
then
they
turned
on
a
private
road
and
in
some
trepidation
approached
a
big
farm
a
dog
barked
furiously
a
woman
came
out
to
see
is
this
the
way
to
willey
farm
morel
asked
paul
hung
behind
in
terror
of
being
sent
back
but
the
woman
was
amiable
and
directed
them
the
mother
and
son
went
through
the
wheat
and
oats
over
a
little
bridge
into
a
wild
meadow
peewits
with
their
white
breasts
glistening
wheeled
and
screamed
about
them
the
lake
was
still
and
blue
high
overhead
a
heron
floated
opposite
the
wood
heaped
on
the
hill
green
and
still
it
a
wild
road
mother
said
paul
just
like
is
it
beautiful
said
morel
looking
round
see
that
heron
see
see
her
legs
he
directed
his
mother
what
she
must
see
and
what
not
and
she
was
quite
content
but
now
she
said
which
way
he
told
me
through
the
the
wood
fenced
and
dark
lay
on
their
left
i
can
feel
a
bit
of
a
path
this
road
said
paul
you
got
town
feet
somehow
or
other
you
they
found
a
little
gate
and
soon
were
in
a
broad
green
alley
of
the
wood
with
a
new
thicket
of
fir
and
pine
on
one
hand
an
old
oak
glade
dipping
down
on
the
other
and
among
the
oaks
the
bluebells
stood
in
pools
of
azure
under
the
new
green
hazels
upon
a
pale
fawn
floor
of
he
found
flowers
for
her
here
a
bit
of
hay
he
said
then
again
he
brought
her
and
again
his
heart
hurt
with
love
seeing
her
hand
used
with
work
holding
the
little
bunch
of
flowers
he
gave
her
she
was
perfectly
happy
but
at
the
end
of
the
riding
was
a
fence
to
climb
paul
was
over
in
a
second
come
he
said
let
me
help
no
go
away
i
will
do
it
in
my
own
he
stood
below
with
his
hands
up
ready
to
help
her
she
climbed
cautiously
what
a
way
to
climb
he
exclaimed
scornfully
when
she
was
safely
to
earth
again
hateful
stiles
she
cried
duffer
of
a
little
woman
he
replied
who
ca
get
over
in
front
along
the
edge
of
the
wood
was
a
cluster
of
low
red
farm
buildings
the
two
hastened
forward
flush
with
the
wood
was
the
apple
orchard
where
blossom
was
falling
on
the
grindstone
the
pond
was
deep
under
a
hedge
and
overhanging
oak
trees
some
cows
stood
in
the
shade
the
farm
and
buildings
three
sides
of
a
quadrangle
embraced
the
sunshine
towards
the
wood
it
was
very
still
mother
and
son
went
into
the
small
railed
garden
where
was
a
scent
of
red
gillivers
by
the
open
door
were
some
floury
loaves
put
out
to
cool
a
hen
was
just
coming
to
peck
them
then
in
the
doorway
suddenly
appeared
a
girl
in
a
dirty
apron
she
was
about
fourteen
years
old
had
a
rosy
dark
face
a
bunch
of
short
black
curls
very
fine
and
free
and
dark
eyes
shy
questioning
a
little
resentful
of
the
strangers
she
disappeared
in
a
minute
another
figure
appeared
a
small
frail
woman
rosy
with
great
dark
brown
eyes
oh
she
exclaimed
smiling
with
a
little
glow
you
come
then
i
am
glad
to
see
her
voice
was
intimate
and
rather
sad
the
two
women
shook
hands
now
are
you
sure
we
not
a
bother
to
you
said
morel
i
know
what
a
farming
life
oh
no
we
only
too
thankful
to
see
a
new
face
it
so
lost
up
i
suppose
so
said
morel
they
were
taken
through
into
the
parlour
a
long
low
room
with
a
great
bunch
of
in
the
fireplace
there
the
women
talked
whilst
paul
went
out
to
survey
the
land
he
was
in
the
garden
smelling
the
gillivers
and
looking
at
the
plants
when
the
girl
came
out
quickly
to
the
heap
of
coal
which
stood
by
the
fence
i
suppose
these
are
he
said
to
her
pointing
to
the
bushes
along
the
fence
she
looked
at
him
with
startled
big
brown
eyes
i
suppose
they
are
when
they
come
out
he
said
i
do
know
she
faltered
they
white
with
pink
then
they
miriam
flushed
she
had
a
beautiful
warm
colouring
i
do
know
she
said
you
do
have
much
in
your
garden
he
said
this
is
our
first
year
here
she
answered
in
a
distant
rather
superior
way
drawing
back
and
going
indoors
he
did
not
notice
but
went
his
round
of
exploration
presently
his
mother
came
out
and
they
went
through
the
buildings
paul
was
hugely
delighted
and
i
suppose
you
have
the
fowls
and
calves
and
pigs
to
look
after
said
morel
to
leivers
no
replied
the
little
woman
i
ca
find
time
to
look
after
cattle
and
i
not
used
to
it
it
as
much
as
i
can
do
to
keep
going
in
the
well
i
suppose
it
is
said
morel
presently
the
girl
came
out
tea
is
ready
mother
she
said
in
a
musical
quiet
voice
oh

you
miriam
then
we
come
replied
her
mother
almost
ingratiatingly
would
you
care
to
have
tea
now
morel
of
course
said
morel
whenever
it
paul
and
his
mother
and
leivers
had
tea
together
then
they
went
out
into
the
wood
that
was
flooded
with
bluebells
while
fumy
were
in
the
paths
the
mother
and
son
were
in
ecstasy
together
when
they
got
back
to
the
house
leivers
and
edgar
the
eldest
son
were
in
the
kitchen
edgar

a
man
in
the
prime
of
life
with
a
moustache
and
blue
eyes
screwed
up
against
the
weather
the
boys
were
condescending
but
paul
scarcely
observed
it
they
went
round
for
eggs
scrambling
into
all
sorts
of
places
as
they
were
feeding
the
fowls
miriam
came
out

boys

her
hard
bright

peck
into
his

started
and

about
herself
somebody
lady
of
the
lake
yah
cried
maurice
miriam
was
crimson
with
shame
and
misery
i
dare
do
more
than
you
she
cried
you
never
anything
but
cowards
and
oh
cowards
and
bullies
they
repeated
mincingly
mocking
her
speech
not
such
a
clown
shall
anger
me
a
boor
is
answered
silently
he
quoted
against
her
shouting
with
laughter
she
went
indoors
paul
went
with
the
boys
into
the
orchard
where
they
had
rigged
up
a
parallel
bar
they
did
feats
of
strength
he
was
more
agile
than
strong
but
it
served
he
fingered
a
piece
of
that
hung
low
on
a
swinging
bough
i
would
get
the
said
edgar
the
eldest
brother
there
be
no
apples
next
i
was
going
to
get
it
replied
paul
going
away
the
boys
felt
hostile
to
him
they
were
more
interested
in
their
own
pursuits
he
wandered
back
to
the
house
to
look
for
his
mother
as
he
went
round
the
back
he
saw
miriam
kneeling
in
front
of
the
some
maize
in
her
hand
biting
her
lip
and
crouching
in
an
intense
attitude
the
hen
was
eyeing
her
wickedly
very
gingerly
she
put
forward
her
hand
the
hen
bobbed
for
her
she
drew
back
quickly
with
a
cry
half
of
fear
half
of
chagrin
it
wo
hurt
you
said
paul
she
flushed
crimson
and
started
up
i
only
wanted
to
try
she
said
in
a
low
voice
see
it
does
hurt
he
said
and
putting
only
two
corns
in
his
palm
he
let
the
hen
peck
peck
peck
at
his
bare
hand
it
only
makes
you
laugh
he
said
she
put
her
hand
forward
and
dragged
it
away
tried
again
and
started
back
with
a
cry
he
frowned
why
i
let
her
take
corn
from
my
face
said
paul
only
she
bumps
a
bit
she
ever
so
neat
if
she
was
look
how
much
ground
she
peck
up
every
he
waited
grimly
and
watched
at
last
miriam
let
the
bird
peck
from
her
hand
she
gave
a
little
cry
fear
and
pain
because
of
fear
rather
pathetic
but
she
had
done
it
and
she
did
it
again
there
you
see
said
the
boy
it
does
hurt
does
it
she
looked
at
him
with
dilated
dark
eyes
no
she
laughed
trembling
then
she
rose
and
went
indoors
she
seemed
to
be
in
some
way
resentful
of
the
boy
he
thinks
i
only
a
common
girl
she
thought
and
she
wanted
to
prove
she
was
a
grand
person
like
the
lady
of
the
lake
paul
found
his
mother
ready
to
go
home
she
smiled
on
her
son
he
took
the
great
bunch
of
flowers
and
leivers
walked
down
the
fields
with
them
the
hills
were
golden
with
evening
deep
in
the
woods
showed
the
darkening
purple
of
bluebells
it
was
everywhere
perfectly
stiff
save
for
the
rustling
of
leaves
and
birds
but
it
is
a
beautiful
place
said
morel
yes
answered
leivers
it
a
nice
little
place
if
only
it
were
for
the
rabbits
the
pasture
bitten
down
to
nothing
i
dunno
if
ever
i
s
get
the
rent
off
he
clapped
his
hands
and
the
field
broke
into
motion
near
the
woods
brown
rabbits
hopping
everywhere
would
you
believe
it
exclaimed
morel
she
and
paul
went
on
alone
together
was
it
lovely
mother
he
said
quietly
a
thin
moon
was
coming
out
his
heart
was
full
of
happiness
till
it
hurt
his
mother
had
to
chatter
because
she
too
wanted
to
cry
with
happiness
now
would
i
help
that
man
she
said
would
i
see
to
the
fowls
and
the
young
stock
and
i
learn
to
milk
and
i
talk
with
him
and
i
plan
with
him
my
word
if
i
were
his
wife
the
farm
would
be
run
i
know
but
there
she
has
the
strength
she
simply
has
the
strength
she
ought
never
to
have
been
burdened
like
it
you
know
sorry
for
her
and
i
sorry
for
him
too
my
word
if
i
had
him
i
should
have
thought
him
a
bad
husband
not
that
she
does
either
and
she
very
william
came
home
again
with
his
sweetheart
at
the
whitsuntide
he
had
one
week
of
his
holidays
then
it
was
beautiful
weather
as
a
rule
william
and
lily
and
paul
went
out
in
the
morning
together
for
a
walk
william
did
not
talk
to
his
beloved
much
except
to
tell
her
things
from
his
boyhood
paul
talked
endlessly
to
both
of
them
they
lay
down
all
three
in
a
meadow
by
minton
church
on
one
side
by
the
castle
farm
was
a
beautiful
quivering
screen
of
poplars
hawthorn
was
dropping
from
the
hedges
penny
daisies
and
ragged
robin
were
in
the
field
like
laughter
william
a
big
fellow
of
thinner
now
and
even
a
bit
gaunt
lay
back
in
the
sunshine
and
dreamed
while
she
fingered
with
his
hair
paul
went
gathering
the
big
daisies
she
had
taken
off
her
hat
her
hair
was
black
as
a
horse
mane
paul
came
back
and
threaded
daisies
in
her
hair
big
spangles
of
white
and
yellow
and
just
a
pink
touch
of
ragged
robin
now
you
look
like
a
young
the
boy
said
to
her
she
william
lily
laughed
william
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
in
his
gaze
was
a
certain
baffled
look
of
misery
and
fierce
appreciation
has
he
made
a
sight
of
me
she
asked
laughing
down
on
her
lover
that
he
has
said
william
smiling
he
looked
at
her
her
beauty
seemed
to
hurt
him
he
glanced
at
her
head
and
frowned
you
look
nice
enough
if
that
what
you
want
to
know
he
said
and
she
walked
without
her
hat
in
a
little
while
william
recovered
and
was
rather
tender
to
her
coming
to
a
bridge
he
carved
her
initials
and
his
in
a
heart
she
watched
his
strong
nervous
hand
with
its
glistening
hairs
and
freckles
as
he
carved
and
she
seemed
fascinated
by
it
all
the
time
there
was
a
feeling
of
sadness
and
warmth
and
a
certain
tenderness
in
the
house
whilst
william
and
lily
were
at
home
but
often
he
got
irritable
she
had
brought
for
an
stay
five
dresses
and
six
blouses
oh
would
you
mind
she
said
to
annie
washing
me
these
two
blouses
and
these
things
and
annie
stood
washing
when
william
and
lily
went
out
the
next
morning
morel
was
furious
and
sometimes
the
young
man
catching
a
glimpse
of
his
sweetheart
attitude
towards
his
sister
hated
her
on
sunday
morning
she
looked
very
beautiful
in
a
dress
of
foulard
silky
and
sweeping
and
blue
as
a
feather
and
in
a
large
cream
hat
covered
with
many
roses
mostly
crimson
nobody
could
admire
her
enough
but
in
the
evening
when
she
was
going
out
she
asked
again
chubby
have
you
got
my
gloves
which
asked
william
my
new
black
there
was
a
hunt
she
had
lost
them
look
here
mother
said
william
that
the
fourth
pair
she
lost
since
christmas
at
five
shillings
a
pair
you
only
gave
me
two
of
them
she
remonstrated
and
in
the
evening
after
supper
he
stood
on
the
hearthrug
whilst
she
sat
on
the
sofa
and
he
seemed
to
hate
her
in
the
afternoon
he
had
left
her
whilst
he
went
to
see
some
old
friend
she
had
sat
looking
at
a
book
after
supper
william
wanted
to
write
a
letter
here
is
your
book
lily
said
morel
would
you
care
to
go
on
with
it
for
a
few
minutes
no
thank
you
said
the
girl
i
will
sit
but
it
is
so
william
scribbled
irritably
at
a
great
rate
as
he
sealed
the
envelope
he
said
read
a
book
why
she
never
read
a
book
in
her
oh
go
along
said
morel
cross
with
the
exaggeration
it
true
mother
she
has
he
cried
jumping
up
and
taking
his
old
position
on
the
hearthrug
she
never
read
a
book
in
her
like
me
chimed
in
morel
canna
see
what
there
is
i
books
ter
sit
borin
your
nose
in
for
nor
more
can
but
you
should
say
these
things
said
morel
to
her
son
but
it
true
mother
she
ca
read
what
did
you
give
her
well
i
gave
her
a
little
thing
of
annie
swan
nobody
wants
to
read
dry
stuff
on
sunday
well
i
bet
she
did
read
ten
lines
of
you
are
mistaken
said
his
mother
all
the
time
lily
sat
miserably
on
the
sofa
he
turned
to
her
swiftly
did
you
read
any
he
asked
yes
i
did
she
replied
how
much
i
do
know
how
many
tell
me
one
thing
you
she
could
not
she
never
got
beyond
the
second
page
he
read
a
great
deal
and
had
a
quick
active
intelligence
she
could
understand
nothing
but
and
chatter
he
was
accustomed
to
having
all
his
thoughts
sifted
through
his
mother
mind
so
when
he
wanted
companionship
and
was
asked
in
reply
to
be
the
billing
and
twittering
lover
he
hated
his
betrothed
you
know
mother
he
said
when
he
was
alone
with
her
at
night
no
idea
of
money
she
so
when
she
paid
suddenly
buy
such
rot
as
marrons
glaces
and
then
i
have
to
buy
her
season
ticket
and
her
extras
even
her
underclothing
and
she
wants
to
get
married
and
i
think
myself
we
might
as
well
get
married
next
year
but
at
this
rate
a
fine
mess
of
a
marriage
it
would
be
replied
his
mother
i
should
consider
it
again
my
oh
well
i
gone
too
far
to
break
off
now
he
said
and
so
i
shall
get
married
as
soon
as
i
very
well
my
boy
if
you
will
you
will
and
there
no
stopping
you
but
i
tell
you
i
ca
sleep
when
i
think
about
oh
she
be
all
right
mother
we
shall
and
she
lets
you
buy
her
underclothing
asked
the
mother
well
he
began
apologetically
she
did
ask
me
but
one
morning
and
it
was
cold
i
found
her
on
the
station
shivering
not
able
to
keep
still
so
i
asked
her
if
she
was
well
wrapped
up
she
said
think
so
so
i
said
you
got
warm
underthings
on
and
she
said
they
were
cotton
i
asked
her
why
on
earth
she
had
got
something
thicker
on
in
weather
like
that
and
she
said
because
she
had
nothing
and
there
she
is
a
bronchial
subject
i
had
to
take
her
and
get
some
warm
things
well
mother
i
should
mind
the
money
if
we
had
any
and
you
know
she
ought
to
keep
enough
to
pay
for
her
but
no
she
comes
to
me
about
that
and
i
have
to
find
the
it
a
poor
lookout
said
morel
bitterly
he
was
pale
and
his
rugged
face
that
used
to
be
so
perfectly
careless
and
laughing
was
stamped
with
conflict
and
despair
but
i
ca
give
her
up
now
it
gone
too
far
he
said
and
besides
for
some
things
i
could
do
without
my
boy
remember
you
taking
your
life
in
your
hands
said
morel
nothing
is
as
bad
as
a
marriage
that
a
hopeless
failure
mine
was
bad
enough
god
knows
and
ought
to
teach
you
something
but
it
might
have
been
worse
by
a
long
he
leaned
with
his
back
against
the
side
of
the
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
was
a
big
man
who
looked
as
if
he
would
go
to
the
world
end
if
he
wanted
to
but
she
saw
the
despair
on
his
face
i
could
give
her
up
now
he
said
well
she
said
remember
there
are
worse
wrongs
than
breaking
off
an
i
ca
give
her
up
now
he
said
the
clock
ticked
on
mother
and
son
remained
in
silence
a
conflict
between
them
but
he
would
say
no
more
at
last
she
said
well
go
to
bed
my
son
you
feel
better
in
the
morning
and
perhaps
you
know
he
kissed
her
and
went
she
raked
the
fire
her
heart
was
heavy
now
as
it
had
never
been
before
with
her
husband
things
had
seemed
to
be
breaking
down
in
her
but
they
did
not
destroy
her
power
to
live
now
her
soul
felt
lamed
in
itself
it
was
her
hope
that
was
struck
and
so
often
william
manifested
the
same
hatred
towards
his
betrothed
on
the
last
evening
at
home
he
was
railing
against
her
well
he
said
if
you
do
believe
me
what
she
like
would
you
believe
she
has
been
confirmed
three
times
nonsense
laughed
morel
nonsense
or
not
she
has
that
what
confirmation
means
for
her
a
bit
of
a
theatrical
show
where
she
can
cut
a
i
have
morel
cried
the
girl
i
have
it
is
not
true
what
he
cried
flashing
round
on
her
once
in
bromley
once
in
beckenham
and
once
somewhere
nowhere
else
she
said
in
tears
nowhere
else
it
was
and
if
it
was
why
were
you
confirmed
twice
once
i
was
only
fourteen
morel
she
pleaded
tears
in
her
eyes
yes
said
morel
i
can
quite
understand
it
child
take
no
notice
of
him
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
william
saying
such
but
it
true
she
religious
she
had
blue
velvet
and
she
not
as
much
religion
or
anything
else
in
her
than
that
gets
confirmed
three
times
for
show
to
show
herself
off
and
that
how
she
is
in
everything
everything
the
girl
sat
on
the
sofa
crying
she
was
not
strong
as
for
love
he
cried
you
might
as
well
ask
a
fly
to
love
you
love
settling
on
you
now
say
no
more
commanded
morel
if
you
want
to
say
these
things
you
must
find
another
place
than
this
i
am
ashamed
of
you
william
why
do
you
be
more
manly
to
do
nothing
but
find
fault
with
a
girl
and
then
pretend
you
engaged
to
her
morel
subsided
in
wrath
and
indignation
william
was
silent
and
later
he
repented
kissed
and
comforted
the
girl
yet
it
was
true
what
he
had
said
he
hated
her
when
they
were
going
away
morel
accompanied
them
as
far
as
nottingham
it
was
a
long
way
to
keston
station
you
know
mother
he
said
to
her
gyp
shallow
nothing
goes
deep
with
william
i
wish
you
would
say
these
things
said
morel
very
uncomfortable
for
the
girl
who
walked
beside
her
but
it
does
mother
she
very
much
in
love
with
me
now
but
if
i
died
she
have
forgotten
me
in
three
morel
was
afraid
her
heart
beat
furiously
hearing
the
quiet
bitterness
of
her
son
last
speech
how
do
you
know
she
replied
you
do
know
and
therefore
you
no
right
to
say
such
a
he
always
saying
these
things
cried
the
girl
in
three
months
after
i
was
buried
you
have
somebody
else
and
i
should
be
forgotten
he
said
and
that
your
love
morel
saw
them
into
the
train
in
nottingham
then
she
returned
home
there
one
comfort
she
said
to
paul
he
never
have
any
money
to
marry
on
that
i
am
sure
of
and
so
she
save
him
that
so
she
took
cheer
matters
were
not
yet
very
desperate
she
firmly
believed
william
would
never
marry
his
gipsy
she
waited
and
she
kept
paul
near
to
her
all
summer
long
william
letters
had
a
feverish
tone
he
seemed
unnatural
and
intense
sometimes
he
was
exaggeratedly
jolly
usually
he
was
flat
and
bitter
in
his
letter
ah
his
mother
said
i
afraid
he
ruining
himself
against
that
creature
who
is
worthy
of
his
love
no
no
more
than
a
rag
he
wanted
to
come
home
the
midsummer
holiday
was
gone
it
was
a
long
while
to
christmas
he
wrote
in
wild
excitement
saying
he
could
come
for
saturday
and
sunday
at
goose
fair
the
first
week
in
october
you
are
not
well
my
boy
said
his
mother
when
she
saw
him
she
was
almost
in
tears
at
having
him
to
herself
again
no
i
not
been
well
he
said
i
seemed
to
have
a
dragging
cold
all
the
last
month
but
it
going
i
it
was
sunny
october
weather
he
seemed
wild
with
joy
like
a
schoolboy
escaped
then
again
he
was
silent
and
reserved
he
was
more
gaunt
than

said
his
mother
on
the
sunday
morning
as
he
was
putting
his
collar
on
look
he
said
to
his
mother
holding
up
his
chin
what
a
rash
my
collar
made
under
my
chin
just
at
the
junction
of
chin
and
throat
was
a
big
red
inflammation
it
ought
not
to
do
that
said
his
mother
here
put
a
bit
of
this
soothing
ointment
on
you
should
wear
different
he
went
away
on
sunday
midnight
seeming
better
and
more
solid
for
his
two
days
at
home
on
tuesday
morning
came
a
telegram
from

that
he
was
morel
got
off
her
knees
from

the
telegram
called
a
neighbour

to
her
landlady
and
borrowed
a
sovereign
put
on
her
things
and
set
off
she
hurried
to
keston
caught
an
express
for
london
in
nottingham
she
had
to
wait
in
nottingham
nearly
an
hour
a
small
figure
in
her
black
bonnet
she
was
anxiously
asking
the
porters
if
they
knew
how
to
get
to
elmers
end
the
journey
was
three
hours
she
sat
in
her
corner
in
a
kind
of
stupor
never
moving
at
king
cross
still
no
one
could
tell
her
how
to
get
to
elmers
end
carrying
her
string
bag
that
contained
her
nightdress
a
comb
and
brush
she
went
from
person
to
person
at
last
they
sent
her
underground
to
cannon
street
it
was
six
when
she
arrived
at
william
lodging
the
blinds
were
not
down
how
is
he
she
asked

better
said
the
landlady
she
followed
the
woman
upstairs
william
lay
on
the
bed
with
bloodshot
eyes
his
face
rather
discoloured
the
clothes
were
tossed
about
there
was
no
fire
in
the
room
a
glass
of
milk
stood
on
the
stand
at
his
bedside
no
one
had
been
with
him
why
my
son
said
the
mother
bravely
he
did
not
answer
he
looked
at
her
but
did
not
see
her
then
he
began
to
say
in
a
dull
voice
as
if
repeating
a
letter
from
dictation
owing
to
a
leakage
in
the
hold
of
this
vessel
the
sugar
had
set
and
become
converted
into
rock
it
needed
hacking
he
was
quite
unconscious
it
had
been
his
business
to
examine
some
such
cargo
of
sugar
in
the
port
of
london
how
long
has
he
been
like
this
the
mother
asked
the
landlady
he
got
home
at
six
on
monday
morning
and
he
seemed
to
sleep
all
day
then
in
the
night
we
heard
him
talking
and
this
morning
he
asked
for
you
so
i

morel
tried
to
soothe
her
son
to
keep
him
still
the
doctor
came
it
was
pneumonia
and
he
said
a
peculiar
erysipelas
which
had
started
under
the
chin
where
the
collar
chafed
and
was
spreading
over
the
face
he
hoped
it
would
not
get
to
the
brain
morel
settled
down
to
nurse
she
prayed
for
william
prayed
that
he
would
recognise
her
but
the
young
man
face
grew
more
discoloured
in
the
night
she
struggled
with
him
he
raved
and
raved
and
would
not
come
to
consciousness
at
two
in
a
dreadful
paroxysm
he
died
morel
sat
perfectly
still
for
an
hour
in
the
lodging
bedroom

she
roused
the
household

with
the
aid
of
the
charwoman

blue

high
up

a
wall
of
trucks

looking
round
waiting
on
the
weighing

against
the
truck
as

were
walking
in
silence
in
the
dark

small
figure

uninterestedly
she
let
him
kiss
her
but
she
seemed
unaware
of
him
in
the
house
she
was
the
same
small
white
and
mute
she
noticed
nothing
she
said
nothing
only

she
relapsed
into

mute
looking
into
space
her
hands
folded
on
her
lap
paul
looking
at
her
felt
he
could
not
breathe
the
house
was
dead
silent
i
went
to
work
mother
he
said
plaintively

an
hour

and
paul
went
with
a
candle
into
the
parlour
there
was
no
gas
there
the
father
unscrewed
the
top
of
the
big
mahogany
oval
table
and
cleared
the
middle
of
the
room
then
he
arranged
six
chairs
opposite
each
other
so
that
the
coffin
could
stand
on
their
beds
you
niver
seed
such
a
length
as
he
is
said
the
miner
and
watching
anxiously
as
he
worked
paul
went
to
the
bay
window
and
looked
out
the
stood
monstrous
and
black
in
front
of
the
wide
darkness
it
was
a
faintly
luminous
night
paul
went
back
to
his
mother
at
ten
morel
called
he
here
everyone
started
there
was
a
noise
of
unbarring
and
unlocking
the
front
door
which
opened
straight
from
the
night
into
the
room
bring
another
candle
called
morel
annie
and
arthur
went
paul
followed
with
his
mother
he
stood
with
his
arm
round
her
waist
in
the
inner
doorway
down
the
middle
of
the
cleared
room
waited
six
chairs
face
to
face
in
the
window
against
the
lace
curtains
arthur
held
up
one
candle
and
by
the
open
door
against
the
night
annie
stood
leaning
forward
her
brass
candlestick
glittering
there
was
the
noise
of
wheels
outside
in
the
darkness
of
the
street
below
paul
could
see
horses
and
a
black
vehicle
one
lamp
and
a
few
pale
faces
then
some
men
miners
all
in
their
seemed
to
struggle
in
the
obscurity
presently
two
men
appeared
bowed
beneath
a
great
weight
it
was
morel
and
his
neighbour
steady
called
morel
out
of
breath
he
and
his
fellow
mounted
the
steep
garden
step
heaved
into
the
candlelight
with
their
gleaming
limbs
of
other
men
were
seen
struggling
behind
morel
and
burns
in
front
staggered
the
great
dark
weight
swayed
steady
steady
cried
morel
as
if
in
pain
all
the
six
bearers
were
up
in
the
small
garden
holding
the
great
coffin
aloft
there
were
three
more
steps
to
the
door
the
yellow
lamp
of
the
carriage
shone
alone
down
the
black
road
now
then
said
morel
the
coffin
swayed
the
men
began
to
mount
the
three
steps
with
their
load
annie
candle
flickered
and
she
whimpered
as
the
first
men
appeared
and
the
limbs
and
bowed
heads
of
six
men
struggled
to
climb
into
the
room
bearing
the
coffin
that
rode
like
sorrow
on
their
living
flesh
oh
my
son
my
son
morel
sang
softly
and
each
time
the
coffin
swung
to
the
unequal
climbing
of
the
men
oh
my
son
my
son
my
son
mother
paul
whimpered
his
hand
round
her
waist
she
did
not
hear
oh
my
son
my
son
she
repeated
paul
saw
drops
of
sweat
fall
from
his
father
brow
six
men
were
in
the
room
six
coatless
men
with
yielding
struggling
limbs
filling
the
room
and
knocking
against
the
furniture
the
coffin
veered
and
was
gently
lowered
on
to
the
chairs
the
sweat
fell
from
morel
face
on
its
boards
my
word
he
a
weight
said
a
man
and
the
five
miners
sighed
bowed
and
trembling
with
the
struggle
descended
the
steps
again
closing
the
door
behind
them
the
family
was
alone
in
the
parlour
with
the
great
polished
box
william
when
laid
out
was
six
feet
four
inches
long
like
a
monument
lay
the
bright
brown
ponderous
coffin
paul
thought
it
would
never
be
got
out
of
the
room
again
his
mother
was
stroking
the
polished
wood
they
buried
him
on
the
monday
in
the
little
cemetery
on
the
hillside
that
looks
over
the
fields
at
the
big
church
and
the
houses
it
was
sunny
and
the
white
chrysanthemums
frilled
themselves
in
the
warmth
morel
could
not
be
persuaded
after
this
to
talk
and
take
her
old
bright
interest
in
life
she
remained
shut
off
all
the
way
home
in
the
train
she
had
said
to
herself
if
only
it
could
have
been
me
when
paul
came
home
at
night
he
found
his
mother
sitting
her
day
work
done
with
hands
folded
in
her
lap
upon
her
coarse
apron
she
always
used
to
have
changed
her
dress
and
put
on
a
black
apron
before
now
annie
set
his
supper
and
his
mother
sat
looking
blankly
in
front
of
her
her
mouth
shut
tight
then
he
beat
his
brains
for
news
to
tell
her
mother
miss
jordan
was
down
and
she
said
my
sketch
of
a
colliery
at
work
was
but
morel
took
no
notice
night
after
night
he
forced
himself
to
tell
her
things
although
she
did
not
listen
it
drove
him
almost
insane
to
have
her
thus
at
last
what
mother
he
asked
she
did
not
hear
what
he
persisted
mother
what
you
know
what
the
matter
she
said
irritably
turning
away
the
lad
he
was
sixteen
years
old
went
to
bed
drearily
he
was
cut
off
and
wretched
through
october
november
and
december
his
mother
tried
but
she
could
not
rouse
herself
she
could
only
brood
on
her
dead
son
he
had
been
let
to
die
so
cruelly
at
last
on
december
with
his
five
shillings
in
his
pocket
paul
wandered
blindly
home
his
mother
looked
at
him
and
her
heart
stood
still
what
the
matter
she
asked
i
badly
mother
he
replied
mr
jordan
gave
me
five
shillings
for
a
he
handed
it
to
her
with
trembling
hands
she
put
it
on
the
table
you
are
glad
he
reproached
her
but
he
trembled
violently
where
hurts
you
she
said
unbuttoning
his
overcoat
it
was
the
old
question
i
feel
badly
she
undressed
him
and
put
him
to
bed
he
had
pneumonia
dangerously
the
doctor
said
might
he
never
have
had
it
if
i
kept
him
at
home
not
let
him
go
to
nottingham
was
one
of
the
first
things
she
asked
he
might
not
have
been
so
bad
said
the
doctor
morel
stood
condemned
on
her
own
ground
i
should
have
watched
the
living
not
the
dead
she
told
herself
paul
was
very
his
mother
lay
in
bed
at
nights
with
him
they
could
not
afford
a
nurse
he
grew
worse
and
the
crisis
approached
one
night
he
tossed
into
consciousness
in
the
ghastly
sickly
feeling
of
dissolution
when
all
the
cells
in
the
body
seem
in
intense
irritability
to
be
breaking
down
and
consciousness
makes
a
last
flare
of
struggle
like
madness
i
s
die
mother
he
cried
heaving
for
breath
on
the
pillow
she
lifted
him
up
crying
in
a
small
voice
oh
my
son
my
son
that
brought
him
to
he
realised
her
his
whole
will
rose
up
and
arrested
him
he
put
his
head
on
her
breast
and
took
ease
of
her
for
love
for
some
things
said
his
aunt
it
was
a
good
thing
paul
was
ill
that
christmas
i
believe
it
saved
his
paul
was
in
bed
for
seven
weeks
he
got
up
white
and
fragile
his
father
had
bought
him
a
pot
of
scarlet
and
gold
tulips
they
used
to
flame
in
the
window
in
the
march
sunshine
as
he
sat
on
the
sofa
chattering
to
his
mother
the
two
knitted
together
in
perfect
intimacy
morel
life
now
rooted
itself
in
paul

been
a
prophet

a
little
present
and
a
letter
from

christmas
morel

a
letter
at
the
new
year
i
was

i
enjoyed

morel
never

any
more
of
her
morel
and
his
wife
were
gentle
with
each
other
for
some
time
after
the
death
of
their
son
he
would
go
into
a
kind
of
daze
staring
and
blank
across
the
room
then
he
got
up
suddenly
and
hurried
out
to
the
three
spots
returning
in
his
normal
state
but
never
in
his
life
would
he
go
for
a
walk
up
shepstone
past
the
office
where
his
son
had
worked
and
he
always
avoided
the
cemetery
part
two
chapter
vii
love
paul
had
been
many
times
up
to
willey
farm
during
the
autumn
he
was
friends
with
the
two
youngest
boys
edgar
the
eldest
would
not
condescend
at
first
and
miriam
also
refused
to
be
approached
she
was
afraid
of
being
set
at
nought
as
by
her
own
brothers
the
girl
was
romantic
in
her
soul
everywhere
was
a
walter
scott
heroine
being
loved
by
men
with
helmets
or
with
plumes
in
their
caps
she
herself
was
something
of
a
princess
turned
into
a
in
her
own
imagination
and
she
was
afraid
lest
this
boy
who
nevertheless
looked
something
like
a
walter
scott
hero
who
could
paint
and
speak
french
and
knew
what
algebra
meant
and
who
went
by
train
to
nottingham
every
day
might
consider
her
simply
as
the
unable
to
perceive
the
princess
beneath
so
she
held
aloof
her
great
companion
was
her
mother
they
were
both
and
inclined
to
be
mystical
such
women
as
treasure
religion
inside
them
breathe
it
in
their
nostrils
and
see
the
whole
of
life
in
a
mist
thereof
so
to
miriam
christ
and
god
made
one
great
figure
which
she
loved
tremblingly
and
passionately
when
a
tremendous
sunset
burned
out
the
western
sky
and
ediths
and
lucys
and
rowenas
brian
de
bois
guilberts
rob
roys
and
guy
mannerings
rustled
the
sunny
leaves
in
the
morning
or
sat
in
her
bedroom
aloft
alone
when
it
snowed
that
was
life
to
her
for
the
rest
she
drudged
in
the
house
which
work
she
would
not
have
minded
had
not
her
clean
red
floor
been
mucked
up
immediately
by
the
trampling
of
her
brothers
she
madly
wanted
her
little
brother
of
four
to
let
her
swathe
him
and
stifle
him
in
her
love
she
went
to
church
reverently
with
bowed
head
and
quivered
in
anguish
from
the
vulgarity
of
the
other
and
from
the
voice
of
the
curate
she
fought
with
her
brothers
whom
she
considered
brutal
louts
and
she
held
not
her
father
in
too
high
esteem
because
he
did
not
carry
any
mystical
ideals
cherished
in
his
heart
but
only
wanted
to
have
as
easy
a
time
as
he
could
and
his
meals
when
he
was
ready
for
them
she
hated
her
position
as
she
wanted
to
be
considered
she
wanted
to
learn
thinking
that
if
she
could
read
as
paul
said
he
could
read
colomba
or
the
voyage
autour
de
ma
chambre
the
world
would
have
a
different
face
for
her
and
a
deepened
respect
she
could
not
be
princess
by
wealth
or
standing
so
she
was
mad
to
have
learning
whereon
to
pride
herself
for
she
was
different
from
other
folk
and
must
not
be
scooped
up
among
the
common
fry
learning
was
the
only
distinction
to
which
she
thought
to
aspire
her
beauty
that
of
a
shy
wild
quiveringly
sensitive
thing
seemed
nothing
to
her
even
her
soul
so
strong
for
rhapsody
was
not
enough
she
must
have
something
to
reinforce
her
pride
because
she
felt
different
from
other
people
paul
she
eyed
rather
wistfully
on
the
whole
she
scorned
the
male
sex
but
here
was
a
new
specimen
quick
light
graceful
who
could
be
gentle
and
who
could
be
sad
and
who
was
clever
and
who
knew
a
lot
and
who
had
a
death
in
the
family
the
poor
morsel
of
learning
exalted
him
almost
in
her
esteem
yet
she
tried
hard
to
scorn
him
because
he
would
not
see
in
her
the
princess
but
only
the
and
he
scarcely
observed
her
then
he
was
so
ill
and
she
felt
he
would
be
weak
then
she
would
be
stronger
than
he
then
she
could
love
him
if
she
could
be
mistress
of
him
in
his
weakness
take
care
of
him
if
he
could
depend
on
her
if
she
could
as
it
were
have
him
in
her
arms
how
she
would
love
him
as
soon
as
the
skies
brightened
and
was
out
paul
drove
off
in
the
milkman
heavy
float
up
to
willey
farm
leivers
shouted
in
a
kindly
fashion
at
the
boy
then
clicked
to
the
horse
as
they
climbed
the
hill
slowly
in
the
freshness
of
the
morning
white
clouds
went
on
their
way
crowding
to
the
back
of
the
hills
that
were
rousing
in
the
springtime
the
water
of
nethermere
lay
below
very
blue
against
the
seared
meadows
and
the
it
was
four
and
a
half
miles
drive
tiny
buds
on
the
hedges
vivid
as
were
opening
into
rosettes
and
thrushes
called
and
blackbirds
shrieked
and
scolded
it
was
a
new
glamorous
world
miriam
peeping
through
the
kitchen
window
saw
the
horse
walk
through
the
big
white
gate
into
the
farmyard
that
was
backed
by
the
still
bare
then
a
youth
in
a
heavy
overcoat
climbed
down
he
put
up
his
hands
for
the
whip
and
the
rug
that
the
ruddy
farmer
handed
down
to
him
miriam
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
was
nearly
sixteen
very
beautiful
with
her
warm
colouring
her
gravity
her
eyes
dilating
suddenly
like
an
ecstasy
i
say
said
paul
turning
shyly
aside
your
daffodils
are
nearly
out
is
it
early
but
do
they
look
cold
cold
said
miriam
in
her
musical
caressing
voice
the
green
on
their
buds
and
he
faltered
into
silence
timidly
let
me
take
the
rug
said
miriam
i
can
carry
it
he
answered
rather
injured
but
he
yielded
it
to
her
then
leivers
appeared
i
sure
you
tired
and
cold
she
said
let
me
take
your
coat
it
is
heavy
you
must
walk
far
in
she
helped
him
off
with
his
coat
he
was
quite
unused
to
such
attention
she
was
almost
smothered
under
its
weight
why
mother
laughed
the
farmer
as
he
passed
through
the
kitchen
swinging
the
great
you
got
almost
more
than
you
can
manage
she
beat
up
the
sofa
cushions
for
the
youth
the
kitchen
was
very
small
and
irregular
the
farm
had
been
originally
a
labourer
cottage
and
the
furniture
was
old
and
battered
but
paul
loved
it
loved
the
that
formed
the
hearthrug
and
the
funny
little
corner
under
the
stairs
and
the
small
window
deep
in
the
corner
through
which
bending
a
little
he
could
see
the
plum
trees
in
the
back
garden
and
the
lovely
round
hills
beyond
wo
you
lie
down
said
leivers
oh
no
i
not
tired
he
said
is
it
lovely
coming
out
do
you
think
i
saw
a
in
blossom
and
a
lot
of
celandines
i
glad
it
can
i
give
you
anything
to
eat
or
to
drink
no
thank
how
your
mother
i
think
she
tired
now
i
think
she
had
too
much
to
do
perhaps
in
a
little
while
she
go
to
skegness
with
me
then
she
be
able
to
rest
i
s
be
glad
if
she
yes
replied
leivers
it
a
wonder
she
is
ill
miriam
was
moving
about
preparing
dinner
paul
watched
everything
that
happened
his
face
was
pale
and
thin
but
his
eyes
were
quick
and
bright
with
life
as
ever
he
watched
the
strange
almost
rhapsodic
way
in
which
the
girl
moved
about
carrying
a
great
to
the
oven
or
looking
in
the
saucepan
the
atmosphere
was
different
from
that
of
his
own
home
where
everything
seemed
so
ordinary
when
leivers
called
loudly
outside
to
the
horse
that
was
reaching
over
to
feed
on
the
in
the
garden
the
girl
started
looked
round
with
dark
eyes
as
if
something
had
come
breaking
in
on
her
world
there
was
a
sense
of
silence
inside
the
house
and
out
miriam
seemed
as
in
some
dreamy
tale
a
maiden
in
bondage
her
spirit
dreaming
in
a
land
far
away
and
magical
and
her
discoloured
old
blue
frock
and
her
broken
boots
seemed
only
like
the
romantic
rags
of
king
cophetua
she
suddenly
became
aware
of
his
keen
blue
eyes
upon
her
taking
her
all
in
instantly
her
broken
boots
and
her
frayed
old
frock
hurt
her
she
resented
his
seeing
everything
even
he
knew
that
her
stocking
was
not
pulled
up
she
went
into
the
scullery
blushing
deeply
and
afterwards
her
hands
trembled
slightly
at
her
work
she
nearly
dropped
all
she
handled
when
her
inside
dream
was
shaken
her
body
quivered
with
trepidation
she
resented
that
he
saw
so
much
leivers
sat
for
some
time
talking
to
the
boy
although
she
was
needed
at
her
work
she
was
too
polite
to
leave
him
presently
she
excused
herself
and
rose
after
a
while
she
looked
into
the
tin
saucepan
oh
dear
miriam
she
cried
these
potatoes
have
boiled
dry
miriam
started
as
if
she
had
been
stung
have
they
mother
she
cried
i
should
care
miriam
said
the
mother
if
i
had
trusted
them
to
she
peered
into
the
pan
the
girl
stiffened
as
if
from
a
blow
her
dark
eyes
dilated
she
remained
standing
in
the
same
spot
well
she
answered
gripped
tight
in
shame
i
sure
i
looked
at
them
five
minutes
yes
said
the
mother
i
know
it
easily
they
not
much
burned
said
paul
it
does
matter
does
it
leivers
looked
at
the
youth
with
her
brown
hurt
eyes
it
would
matter
but
for
the
boys
she
said
to
him
only
miriam
knows
what
a
trouble
they
make
if
the
potatoes
are
then
thought
paul
to
himself
you
should
let
them
make
a
after
a
while
edgar
came
in
he
wore
leggings
and
his
boots
were
covered
with
earth
he
was
rather
small
rather
formal
for
a
farmer
he
glanced
at
paul
nodded
to
him
distantly
and
said
dinner
ready
nearly
edgar
replied
the
mother
apologetically
i
ready
for
mine
said
the
young
man
taking
up
the
newspaper
and
reading
presently
the
rest
of
the
family
trooped
in
dinner
was
served
the
meal
went
rather
brutally
the
and
apologetic
tone
of
the
mother
brought
out
all
the
brutality
of
manners
in
the
sons
edgar
tasted
the
potatoes
moved
his
mouth
quickly
like
a
rabbit
looked
indignantly
at
his
mother
and
said
these
potatoes
are
burnt
yes
edgar
i
forgot
them
for
a
minute
perhaps
you
have
bread
if
you
ca
eat
edgar
looked
in
anger
across
at
miriam
what
was
miriam
doing
that
she
could
attend
to
them
he
said
miriam
looked
up
her
mouth
opened
her
dark
eyes
blazed
and
winced
but
she
said
nothing
she
swallowed
her
anger
and
her
shame
bowing
her
dark
head
i
sure
she
was
trying
hard
said
the
mother
she
has
got
sense
even
to
boil
the
potatoes
said
edgar
what
is
she
kept
at
home
for
for
eating
everything
that
left
in
th
pantry
said
maurice
they
do
forget
that
against
our
miriam
laughed
the
father
she
was
utterly
humiliated
the
mother
sat
in
silence
suffering
like
some
saint
out
of
place
at
the
brutal
board
it
puzzled
paul
he
wondered
vaguely
why
all
this
intense
feeling
went
running
because
of
a
few
burnt
potatoes
the
mother
exalted
everything
even
a
bit
of
housework
to
the
plane
of
a
religious
trust
the
sons
resented
this
they
felt
themselves
cut
away
underneath
and
they
answered
with
brutality
and
also
with
a
sneering
superciliousness
paul
was
just
opening
out
from
childhood
into
manhood
this
atmosphere
where
everything
took
a
religious
value
came
with
a
subtle
fascination
to
him
there
was
something
in
the
air
his
own
mother
was
logical
here
there
was
something
different
something
he
loved
something
that
at
times
he
hated
miriam
quarrelled
with
her
brothers
fiercely
later
in
the
afternoon
when
they
had
gone
away
again
her
mother
said
you
disappointed
me
at
the
girl
dropped
her
head
they
are
such
brutes
she
suddenly
cried
looking
up
with
flashing
eyes
but
had
you
promised
not
to
answer
them
said
the
mother
and
i
believed
in
you
i
ca
stand
it
when
you
but
they
so
hateful
cried
miriam
and
and
yes
dear
but
how
often
have
i
asked
you
not
to
answer
edgar
back
ca
you
let
him
say
what
he
likes
but
why
should
he
say
what
he
likes
are
you
strong
enough
to
bear
it
miriam
if
even
for
my
sake
are
you
so
weak
that
you
must
wrangle
with
them
leivers
stuck
unflinchingly
to
this
doctrine
of
the
other
cheek
she
could
not
instil
it
at
all
into
the
boys
with
the
girls
she
succeeded
better
and
miriam
was
the
child
of
her
heart
the
boys
loathed
the
other
cheek
when
it
was
presented
to
them
miriam
was
often
sufficiently
lofty
to
turn
it
then
they
spat
on
her
and
hated
her
but
she
walked
in
her
proud
humility
living
within
herself
there
was
always
this
feeling
of
jangle
and
discord
in
the
leivers
family
although
the
boys
resented
so
bitterly
this
eternal
appeal
to
their
deeper
feelings
of
resignation
and
proud
humility
yet
it
had
its
effect
on
them
they
could
not
establish
between
themselves
and
an
outsider
just
the
ordinary
human
feeling
and
unexaggerated
friendship
they
were
always
restless
for
the
something
deeper
ordinary
folk
seemed
shallow
to
them
trivial
and
inconsiderable
and
so
they
were
unaccustomed
painfully
uncouth
in
the
simplest
social
intercourse
suffering
and
yet
insolent
in
their
superiority
then
beneath
was
the
yearning
for
the
to
which
they
could
not
attain
because
they
were
too
dumb
and
every
approach
to
close
connection
was
blocked
by
their
clumsy
contempt
of
other
people
they
wanted
genuine
intimacy
but
they
could
not
get
even
normally
near
to
anyone
because
they
scorned
to
take
the
first
steps
they
scorned
the
triviality
which
forms
common
human
intercourse
paul
fell
under
leivers
spell
everything
had
a
religious
and
intensified
meaning
when
he
was
with
her
his
soul
hurt
highly
developed
sought
her
as
if
for
nourishment
together
they
seemed
to
sift
the
vital
fact
from
an
experience
miriam
was
her
mother
daughter
in
the
sunshine
of
the
afternoon
mother
and
daughter
went
down
the
fields
with
him
they
looked
for
nests
there
was
a
jenny
wren
in
the
hedge
by
the
orchard
i
do
want
you
to
see
this
said
leivers
he
crouched
down
and
carefully
put
his
finger
through
the
thorns
into
the
round
door
of
the
nest
it
almost
as
if
you
were
feeling
inside
the
live
body
of
the
bird
he
said
it
so
warm
they
say
a
bird
makes
its
nest
round
like
a
cup
with
pressing
its
breast
on
it
then
how
did
it
make
the
ceiling
round
i
wonder
the
nest
seemed
to
start
into
life
for
the
two
women
after
that
miriam
came
to
see
it
every
day
it
seemed
so
close
to
her
again
going
down
the
hedgeside
with
the
girl
he
noticed
the
celandines
scalloped
splashes
of
gold
on
the
side
of
the
ditch
i
like
them
he
said
when
their
petals
go
flat
back
with
the
sunshine
they
seemed
to
be
pressing
themselves
at
the
and
then
the
celandines
ever
after
drew
her
with
a
little
spell
anthropomorphic
as
she
was
she
stimulated
him
into
appreciating
things
thus
and
then
they
lived
for
her
she
seemed
to
need
things
kindling
in
her
imagination
or
in
her
soul
before
she
felt
she
had
them
and
she
was
cut
off
from
ordinary
life
by
her
religious
intensity
which
made
the
world
for
her
either
a
nunnery
garden
or
a
paradise
where
sin
and
knowledge
were
not
or
else
an
ugly
cruel
thing
so
it
was
in
this
atmosphere
of
subtle
intimacy
this
meeting
in
their
common
feeling
for
something
in
nature
that
their
love
started
personally
he
was
a
long
time
before
he
realized
her
for
ten
months
he
had
to
stay
at
home
after
his
illness
for
a
while
he
went
to
skegness
with
his
mother
and
was
perfectly
happy
but
even
from
the
seaside
he
wrote
long
letters
to
leivers
about
the
shore
and
the
sea
and
he
brought
back
his
beloved
sketches
of
the
flat
lincoln
coast
anxious
for
them
to
see
almost
they
would
interest
the
leivers
more
than
they
interested
his
mother
it
was
not
his
art
morel
cared
about
it
was
himself
and
his
achievement
but
leivers
and
her
children
were
almost
his
disciples
they
kindled
him
and
made
him
glow
to
his
work
whereas
his
mother
influence
was
to
make
him
quietly
determined
patient
dogged
unwearied
he
soon
was
friends
with
the
boys
whose
rudeness
was
only
superficial
they
had
all
when
they
could
trust
themselves
a
strange
gentleness
and
lovableness
will
you
come
with
me
on
to
the
fallow
asked
edgar
rather
hesitatingly
paul
went
joyfully
and
spent
the
afternoon
helping
to
hoe
or
to
single
turnips
with
his
friend
he
used
to
lie
with
the
three
brothers
in
the
hay
piled
up
in
the
barn
and
tell
them
about
nottingham
and
about
jordan
in
return
they
taught
him
to
milk
and
let
him
do
little
jobs
chopping
hay
or
pulping
turnips
just
as
much
as
he
liked
at
midsummer
he
worked
all
through
with
them
and
then
he
loved
them
the
family
was
so
cut
off
from
the
world
actually
they
seemed
somehow
like
derniers
fils
race
though
the
lads
were
strong
and
healthy
yet
they
had
all
that
and
which
made
them
so
lonely
yet
also
such
close
delicate
friends
once
their
intimacy
was
won
paul
loved
them
dearly
and
they
him
miriam
came
later
but
he
had
come
into
her
life
before
she
made
any
mark
on
his
one
dull
afternoon
when
the
men
were
on
the
land
and
the
rest
at
school
only
miriam
and
her
mother
at
home
the
girl
said
to
him
after
having
hesitated
for
some
time
have
you
seen
the
swing
no
he
answered
where
in
the
cowshed
she
replied
she
always
hesitated
to
offer
or
to
show
him
anything
men
have
such
different
standards
of
worth
from
women
and
her
dear
things
the
valuable
things
to
her
her
brothers
had
so
often
mocked
or
flouted
come
on
then
he
replied
jumping
up
there
were
two
cowsheds
one
on
either
side
of
the
barn
in
the
lower
darker
shed
there
was
standing
for
four
cows
hens
flew
scolding
over
the
as
the
youth
and
girl
went
forward
for
the
great
thick
rope
which
hung
from
the
beam
in
the
darkness
overhead
and
was
pushed
back
over
a
peg
in
the
wall
it
something
like
a
rope
he
exclaimed
appreciatively
and
he
sat
down
on
it
anxious
to
try
it
then
immediately
he
rose
come
on
then
and
have
first
go
he
said
to
the
girl
see
she
answered
going
into
the
barn
we
put
some
bags
on
the
seat
and
she
made
the
swing
comfortable
for
him
that
gave
her
pleasure
he
held
the
rope
come
on
then
he
said
to
her
no
i
wo
go
first
she
answered
she
stood
aside
in
her
still
aloof
fashion
why
you
go
she
pleaded
almost
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
the
pleasure
of
giving
up
to
a
man
of
spoiling
him
paul
looked
at
her
all
right
he
said
sitting
down
mind
out
he
set
off
with
a
spring
and
in
a
moment
was
flying
through
the
air
almost
out
of
the
door
of
the
shed
the
upper
half
of
which
was
open
showing
outside
the
drizzling
rain
the
filthy
yard
the
cattle
standing
disconsolate
against
the
black
cartshed
and
at
the
back
of
all
the
wall
of
the
wood
she
stood
below
in
her
crimson
and
watched
he
looked
down
at
her
and
she
saw
his
blue
eyes
sparkling
it
a
treat
of
a
swing
he
said
he
was
swinging
through
the
air
every
bit
of
him
swinging
like
a
bird
that
swoops
for
joy
of
movement
and
he
looked
down
at
her
her
crimson
cap
hung
over
her
dark
curls
her
beautiful
warm
face
so
still
in
a
kind
of
brooding
was
lifted
towards
him
it
was
dark
and
rather
cold
in
the
shed
suddenly
a
swallow
came
down
from
the
high
roof
and
darted
out
of
the
door
i
did
know
a
bird
was
watching
he
called
he
swung
negligently
she
could
feel
him
falling
and
lifting
through
the
air
as
if
he
were
lying
on
some
force
now
i
die
he
said
in
a
detached
dreamy
voice
as
though
he
were
the
dying
motion
of
the
swing
she
watched
him
fascinated
suddenly
he
put
on
the
brake
and
jumped
out
i
had
a
long
turn
he
said
but
it
a
treat
of
a
swing
it
a
real
treat
of
a
swing
miriam
was
amused
that
he
took
a
swing
so
seriously
and
felt
so
warmly
over
it
no
you
go
on
she
said
why
do
you
want
one
he
asked
astonished
well
not
much
i
have
just
a
she
sat
down
whilst
he
kept
the
bags
in
place
for
her
it
so
ripping
he
said
setting
her
in
motion
keep
your
heels
up
or
they
bang
the
manger
she
felt
the
accuracy
with
which
he
caught
her
exactly
at
the
right
moment
and
the
exactly
proportionate
strength
of
his
thrust
and
she
was
afraid
down
to
her
bowels
went
the
hot
wave
of
fear
she
was
in
his
hands
again
firm
and
inevitable
came
the
thrust
at
the
right
moment
she
gripped
the
rope
almost
swooning
ha
she
laughed
in
fear
no
higher
but
you
not
a
bit
high
he
remonstrated
but
no
he
heard
the
fear
in
her
voice
and
desisted
her
heart
melted
in
hot
pain
when
the
moment
came
for
him
to
thrust
her
forward
again
but
he
left
her
alone
she
began
to
breathe
wo
you
really
go
any
farther
he
asked
should
i
keep
you
there
no
let
me
go
by
myself
she
answered
he
moved
aside
and
watched
her
why
you
scarcely
moving
he
said
she
laughed
slightly
with
shame
and
in
a
moment
got
down
they
say
if
you
can
swing
you
wo
be
he
said
as
he
mounted
again
i
do
believe
i
should
ever
be
away
he
went
there
was
something
fascinating
to
her
in
him
for
the
moment
he
was
nothing
but
a
piece
of
swinging
stuff
not
a
particle
of
him
that
did
not
swing
she
could
never
lose
herself
so
nor
could
her
brothers
it
roused
a
warmth
in
her
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
a
flame
that
had
lit
a
warmth
in
her
whilst
he
swung
in
the
middle
air
and
gradually
the
intimacy
with
the
family
concentrated
for
paul
on
three
persons
the
mother
edgar
and
miriam
to
the
mother
he
went
for
that
sympathy
and
that
appeal
which
seemed
to
draw
him
out
edgar
was
his
very
close
friend
and
to
miriam
he
more
or
less
condescended
because
she
seemed
so
humble
but
the
girl
gradually
sought
him
out
if
he
brought
up
his
it
was
she
who
pondered
longest
over
the
last
picture
then
she
would
look
up
at
him
suddenly
her
dark
eyes
alight
like
water
that
shakes
with
a
stream
of
gold
in
the
dark
she
would
ask
why
do
i
like
this
so
always
something
in
his
breast
shrank
from
these
close
intimate
dazzled
looks
of
hers
why
do
you
he
asked
i
do
know
it
seems
so
it
because
it
because
there
is
scarcely
any
shadow
in
it
more
shimmery
as
if
i
painted
the
shimmering
protoplasm
in
the
leaves
and
everywhere
and
not
the
stiffness
of
the
shape
that
seems
dead
to
me
only
this
shimmeriness
is
the
real
living
the
shape
is
a
dead
crust
the
shimmer
is
inside
and
she
with
her
little
finger
in
her
mouth
would
ponder
these
sayings
they
gave
her
a
feeling
of
life
again
and
vivified
things
which
had
meant
nothing
to
her
she
managed
to
find
some
meaning
in
his
struggling
abstract
speeches
and
they
were
the
medium
through
which
she
came
distinctly
at
her
beloved
objects
another
day
she
sat
at
sunset
whilst
he
was
painting
some
which
caught
the
red
glare
from
the
west
he
had
been
quiet
there
you
are
he
said
suddenly
i
wanted
that
now
look
at
them
and
tell
me
are
they
pine
trunks
or
are
they
red
coals
pieces
of
fire
in
that
darkness
there
god
burning
bush
for
you
that
burned
not
miriam
looked
and
was
frightened
but
the
pine
trunks
were
wonderful
to
her
and
distinct
he
packed
his
box
and
rose
suddenly
he
looked
at
her
why
are
you
always
sad
he
asked
her
sad
she
exclaimed
looking
up
at
him
with
startled
wonderful
brown
eyes
yes
he
replied
you
are
always
i
am
not
oh
not
a
bit
she
cried
but
even
your
joy
is
like
a
flame
coming
off
of
sadness
he
persisted
you
never
jolly
or
even
just
all
no
she
pondered
i
wonder
why
because
you
not
because
you
different
inside
like
a
and
then
you
flare
up
but
you
not
just
like
an
ordinary
tree
with
fidgety
leaves
and
jolly
he
got
tangled
up
in
his
own
speech
but
she
brooded
on
it
and
he
had
a
strange
roused
sensation
as
if
his
feelings
were
new
she
got
so
near
him
it
was
a
strange
stimulant
then
sometimes
he
hated
her
her
youngest
brother
was
only
five
he
was
a
frail
lad
with
immense
brown
eyes
in
his
quaint
fragile
face
one
of
reynolds
choir
of
angels
with
a
touch
of
elf
often
miriam
kneeled
to
the
child
and
drew
him
to
her
eh
my
hubert
she
sang
in
a
voice
heavy
and
surcharged
with
love
eh
my
hubert
and
folding
him
in
her
arms
she
swayed
slightly
from
side
to
side
with
love
her
face
half
lifted
her
eyes
half
closed
her
voice
drenched
with
love
do
said
the
child
uneasy
do
miriam
yes
you
love
me
do
you
she
murmured
deep
in
her
throat
almost
as
if
she
were
in
a
trance
and
swaying
also
as
if
she
were
swooned
in
an
ecstasy
of
love
do
repeated
the
child
a
frown
on
his
clear
brow
you
love
me
do
you
she
murmured
what
do
you
make
such
a
fuss
for
cried
paul
all
in
suffering
because
of
her
extreme
emotion
why
ca
you
be
ordinary
with
him
she
let
the
child
go
and
rose
and
said
nothing
her
intensity
which
would
leave
no
emotion
on
a
normal
plane
irritated
the
youth
into
a
frenzy
and
this
fearful
naked
contact
of
her
on
small
occasions
shocked
him
he
was
used
to
his
mother
reserve
and
on
such
occasions
he
was
thankful
in
his
heart
and
soul
that
he
had
his
mother
so
sane
and
wholesome
all
the
life
of
miriam
body
was
in
her
eyes
which
were
usually
dark
as
a
dark
church
but
could
flame
with
light
like
a
conflagration
her
face
scarcely
ever
altered
from
its
look
of
brooding
she
might
have
been
one
of
the
women
who
went
with
mary
when
jesus
was
dead
her
body
was
not
flexible
and
living
she
walked
with
a
swing
rather
heavily
her
head
bowed
forward
pondering
she
was
not
clumsy
and
yet
none
of
her
movements
seemed
quite
the
movement
often
when
wiping
the
dishes
she
would
stand
in
bewilderment
and
chagrin
because
she
had
pulled
in
two
halves
a
cup
or
a
tumbler
it
was
as
if
in
her
fear
and
she
put
too
much
strength
into
the
effort
there
was
no
looseness
or
abandon
about
her
everything
was
gripped
stiff
with
intensity
and
her
effort
overcharged
closed
in
on
itself
she
rarely
varied
from
her
swinging
forward
intense
walk
occasionally
she
ran
with
paul
down
the
fields
then
her
eyes
blazed
naked
in
a
kind
of
ecstasy
that
frightened
him
but
she
was
physically
afraid
if
she
were
getting
over
a
stile
she
gripped
his
hands
in
a
little
hard
anguish
and
began
to
lose
her
presence
of
mind
and
he
could
not
persuade
her
to
jump
from
even
a
small
height
her
eyes
dilated
became
exposed
and
palpitating
no
she
cried
half
laughing
in
terror
no
you
shall
he
cried
once
and
jerking
her
forward
he
brought
her
falling
from
the
fence
but
her
wild
ah
of
pain
as
if
she
were
losing
consciousness
cut
him
she
landed
on
her
feet
safely
and
afterwards
had
courage
in
this
respect
she
was
very
much
dissatisfied
with
her
lot
do
you
like
being
at
home
paul
asked
her
surprised
who
would
she
answered
low
and
intense
what
is
it
i
all
day
cleaning
what
the
boys
make
just
as
bad
in
five
minutes
i
do
want
to
be
at
what
do
you
want
then
i
want
to
do
something
i
want
a
chance
like
anybody
else
why
should
i
because
i
a
girl
be
kept
at
home
and
not
allowed
to
be
anything
what
chance
have
i
chance
of
what
of
knowing
anything
of
learning
of
doing
anything
it
not
fair
because
i
a
she
seemed
very
bitter
paul
wondered
in
his
own
home
annie
was
almost
glad
to
be
a
girl
she
had
not
so
much
responsibility
things
were
lighter
for
her
she
never
wanted
to
be
other
than
a
girl
but
miriam
almost
fiercely
wished
she
were
a
man
and
yet
she
hated
men
at
the
same
time
but
it
as
well
to
be
a
woman
as
a
man
he
said
frowning
ha
is
it
men
have
i
should
think
women
ought
to
be
as
glad
to
be
women
as
men
are
to
be
men
he
answered
no
she
shook
her
head
no
everything
the
men
but
what
do
you
want
he
asked
i
want
to
learn
why
should
it
be
that
i
know
nothing
what
such
as
mathematics
and
french
why
should
i
know
mathematics
yes
she
cried
her
eye
expanding
in
a
kind
of
defiance
well
you
can
learn
as
much
as
i
know
he
said
i
teach
you
if
you
her
eyes
dilated
she
mistrusted
him
as
teacher
would
you
he
asked
her
head
had
dropped
and
she
was
sucking
her
finger
broodingly
yes
she
said
hesitatingly
he
used
to
tell
his
mother
all
these
things
i
going
to
teach
miriam
algebra
he
said
well
replied
morel
i
hope
she
get
fat
on
when
he
went
up
to
the
farm
on
the
monday
evening
it
was
drawing
twilight
miriam
was
just
sweeping
up
the
kitchen
and
was
kneeling
at
the
hearth
when
he
entered
everyone
was
out
but
her
she
looked
round
at
him
flushed
her
dark
eyes
shining
her
fine
hair
falling
about
her
face
hello
she
said
soft
and
musical
i
knew
it
was
how
i
knew
your
step
nobody
treads
so
quick
and
he
sat
down
sighing
ready
to
do
some
algebra
he
asked
drawing
a
little
book
from
his
pocket
but
he
could
feel
her
backing
away
you
said
you
wanted
he
insisted
though
she
faltered
but
i
came
on
purpose
and
if
you
want
to
learn
it
you
must
she
took
up
her
ashes
in
the
dustpan
and
looked
at
him
half
tremulously
laughing
yes
but
you
see
i
have
thought
of
well
my
goodness
take
the
ashes
and
he
went
and
sat
on
the
stone
bench
in
the
where
the
big
were
standing
tipped
up
to
air
the
men
were
in
the
cowsheds
he
could
hear
the
little
of
the
milk
spurting
into
the
pails
presently
she
came
bringing
some
big
greenish
apples
you
know
you
like
them
she
said
he
took
a
bite
sit
down
he
said
with
his
mouth
full
she
was
and
peered
over
his
shoulder
it
irritated
him
he
gave
her
the
book
quickly
here
he
said
it
only
letters
for
figures
you
put
down
instead
of
or
they
worked
he
talking
she
with
her
head
down
on
the
book
he
was
quick
and
hasty
she
never
answered
occasionally
when
he
demanded
of
her
do
you
see
she
looked
up
at
him
her
eyes
wide
with
the
that
comes
of
fear
do
you
he
cried
he
had
been
too
fast
but
she
said
nothing
he
questioned
her
more
then
got
hot
it
made
his
blood
rouse
to
see
her
there
as
it
were
at
his
mercy
her
mouth
open
her
eyes
dilated
with
laughter
that
was
afraid
apologetic
ashamed
then
edgar
came
along
with
two
buckets
of
milk
hello
he
said
what
are
you
doing
algebra
replied
paul
algebra
repeated
edgar
curiously
then
he
passed
on
with
a
laugh
paul
took
a
bite
at
his
forgotten
apple
looked
at
the
miserable
cabbages
in
the
garden
pecked
into
lace
by
the
fowls
and
he
wanted
to
pull
them
up
then
he
glanced
at
miriam
she
was
poring
over
the
book
seemed
absorbed
in
it
yet
trembling
lest
she
could
not
get
at
it
it
made
him
cross
she
was
ruddy
and
beautiful
yet
her
soul
seemed
to
be
intensely
supplicating
the
she
closed
shrinking
knowing
he
was
angered
and
at
the
same
instant
he
grew
gentle
seeing
her
hurt
because
she
did
not
understand
but
things
came
slowly
to
her
and
when
she
held
herself
in
a
grip
seemed
so
utterly
humble
before
the
lesson
it
made
his
blood
rouse
he
stormed
at
her
got
ashamed
continued
the
lesson
and
grew
furious
again
abusing
her
she
listened
in
silence
occasionally
very
rarely
she
defended
herself
her
liquid
dark
eyes
blazed
at
him
you
do
give
me
time
to
learn
it
she
said
all
right
he
answered
throwing
the
book
on
the
table
and
lighting
a
cigarette
then
after
a
while
he
went
back
to
her
repentant
so
the
lessons
went
he
was
always
either
in
a
rage
or
very
gentle
what
do
you
tremble
your
soul
before
it
for
he
cried
you
learn
algebra
with
your
blessed
soul
ca
you
look
at
it
with
your
clear
simple
wits
often
when
he
went
again
into
the
kitchen
leivers
would
look
at
him
reproachfully
saying
paul
do
be
so
hard
on
miriam
she
may
not
be
quick
but
i
sure
she
i
ca
help
it
he
said
rather
pitiably
i
go
off
like
you
do
mind
me
miriam
do
you
he
asked
of
the
girl
later
no
she
reassured
him
in
her
beautiful
deep
tones
no
i
do
do
mind
me
it
my
but
in
spite
of
himself
his
blood
began
to
boil
with
her
it
was
strange
that
no
one
else
made
him
in
such
fury
he
flared
against
her
once
he
threw
the
pencil
in
her
face
there
was
a
silence
she
turned
her
face
slightly
aside
i
did
he
began
but
got
no
farther
feeling
weak
in
all
his
bones
she
never
reproached
him
or
was
angry
with
him
he
was
often
cruelly
ashamed
but
still
again
his
anger
burst
like
a
bubble
surcharged
and
still
when
he
saw
her
eager
silent
as
it
were
blind
face
he
felt
he
wanted
to
throw
the
pencil
in
it
and
still
when
he
saw
her
hand
trembling
and
her
mouth
parted
with
suffering
his
heart
was
scalded
with
pain
for
her
and
because
of
the
intensity
to
which
she
roused
him
he
sought
her
then
he
often
avoided
her
and
went
with
edgar
miriam
and
her
brother
were
naturally
antagonistic
edgar
was
a
rationalist
who
was
curious
and
had
a
sort
of
scientific
interest
in
life
it
was
a
great
bitterness
to
miriam
to
see
herself
deserted
by
paul
for
edgar
who
seemed
so
much
lower
but
the
youth
was
very
happy
with
her
elder
brother
the
two
men
spent
afternoons
together
on
the
land
or
in
the
loft
doing
carpentry
when
it
rained
and
they
talked
together
or
paul
taught
edgar
the
songs
he
himself
had
learned
from
annie
at
the
piano
and
often
all
the
men
leivers
as
well
had
bitter
debates
on
the
nationalizing
of
the
land
and
similar
problems
paul
had
already
heard
his
mother
views
and
as
these
were
as
yet
his
own
he
argued
for
her
miriam
attended
and
took
part
but
was
all
the
time
waiting
until
it
should
be
over
and
a
personal
communication
might
begin
after
all
she
said
within
herself
if
the
land
were
nationalized
edgar
and
paul
and
i
would
be
just
the
so
she
waited
for
the
youth
to
come
back
to
her
he
was
studying
for
his
painting
he
loved
to
sit
at
home
alone
with
his
mother
at
night
working
and
working
she
sewed
or
read
then
looking
up
from
his
task
he
would
rest
his
eyes
for
a
moment
on
her
face
that
was
bright
with
living
warmth
and
he
returned
gladly
to
his
work
i
can
do
my
best
things
when
you
sit
there
in
your
mother
he
said
i
sure
she
exclaimed
sniffing
with
mock
scepticism
but
she
felt
it
was
so
and
her
heart
quivered
with
brightness
for
many
hours
she
sat
still
slightly
conscious
of
him
labouring
away
whilst
she
worked
or
read
her
book
and
he
with
all
his
soul
intensity
directing
his
pencil
could
feel
her
warmth
inside
him
like
strength
they
were
both
very
happy
so
and
both
unconscious
of
it
these
times
that
meant
so
much
and
which
were
real
living
they
almost
ignored
he
was
conscious
only
when
stimulated
a
sketch
finished
he
always
wanted
to
take
it
to
miriam
then
he
was
stimulated
into
knowledge
of
the
work
he
had
produced
unconsciously
in
contact
with
miriam
he
gained
insight
his
vision
went
deeper
from
his
mother
he
drew
the
the
strength
to
produce
miriam
urged
this
warmth
into
intensity
like
a
white
light
when
he
returned
to
the
factory
the
conditions
of
work
were
better
he
had
wednesday
afternoon
off
to
go
to
the
art
school
miss
provision
returning
in
the
evening
then
the
factory
closed
at
six
instead
of
eight
on
thursday
and
friday
evenings
one
evening
in
the
summer
miriam
and
he
went
over
the
fields
by
farm
on
their
way
from
the
library
home
so
it
was
only
three
miles
to
willey
farm
there
was
a
yellow
glow
over
the
and
the
burned
crimson
gradually
as
they
walked
along
the
high
land
the
gold
in
the
west
sank
down
to
red
the
red
to
crimson
and
then
the
chill
blue
crept
up
against
the
glow
they
came
out
upon
the
high
road
to
alfreton
which
ran
white
between
the
darkening
fields
there
paul
hesitated
it
was
two
miles
home
for
him
one
mile
forward
for
miriam
they
both
looked
up
the
road
that
ran
in
shadow
right
under
the
glow
of
the
sky
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
selby
with
its
stark
houses
and
the
headstocks
of
the
pit
stood
in
black
silhouette
small
against
the
sky
he
looked
at
his
watch
nine
he
said
the
pair
stood
loth
to
part
hugging
their
books
the
wood
is
so
lovely
now
she
said
i
wanted
you
to
see
he
followed
her
slowly
across
the
road
to
the
white
gate
they
grumble
so
if
i
late
he
said
but
you
not
doing
anything
wrong
she
answered
impatiently
he
followed
her
across
the
nibbled
pasture
in
the
dusk
there
was
a
coolness
in
the
wood
a
scent
of
leaves
of
honeysuckle
and
a
twilight
the
two
walked
in
silence
night
came
wonderfully
there
among
the
throng
of
dark
he
looked
round
expectant
she
wanted
to
show
him
a
certain
bush
she
had
discovered
she
knew
it
was
wonderful
and
yet
till
he
had
seen
it
she
felt
it
had
not
come
into
her
soul
only
he
could
make
it
her
own
immortal
she
was
dissatisfied
dew
was
already
on
the
paths
in
the
old
a
mist
was
rising
and
he
hesitated
wondering
whether
one
whiteness
were
a
strand
of
fog
or
only
pallid
in
a
cloud
by
the
time
they
came
to
the
miriam
was
getting
very
eager
and
very
tense
her
bush
might
be
gone
she
might
not
be
able
to
find
it
and
she
wanted
it
so
much
almost
passionately
she
wanted
to
be
with
him
when
he
stood
before
the
flowers
they
were
going
to
have
a
communion
together
something
that
thrilled
her
something
holy
he
was
walking
beside
her
in
silence
they
were
very
near
to
each
other
she
trembled
and
he
listened
vaguely
anxious
coming
to
the
edge
of
the
wood
they
saw
the
sky
in
front
like
and
the
earth
growing
dark
somewhere
on
the
outermost
branches
of
the
the
honeysuckle
was
streaming
scent
where
he
asked
down
the
middle
path
she
murmured
quivering
when
they
turned
the
corner
of
the
path
she
stood
still
in
the
wide
walk
between
the
pines
gazing
rather
frightened
she
could
distinguish
nothing
for
some
moments
the
greying
light
robbed
things
of
their
colour
then
she
saw
her
bush
ah
she
cried
hastening
forward
it
was
very
still
the
tree
was
tall
and
straggling
it
had
thrown
its
briers
over
a
and
its
long
streamers
trailed
thick
right
down
to
the
grass
splashing
the
darkness
everywhere
with
great
spilt
stars
pure
white
in
bosses
of
ivory
and
in
large
splashed
stars
the
roses
gleamed
on
the
darkness
of
foliage
and
stems
and
grass
paul
and
miriam
stood
close
together
silent
and
watched
point
after
point
the
steady
roses
shone
out
to
them
seeming
to
kindle
something
in
their
souls
the
dusk
came
like
smoke
around
and
still
did
not
put
out
the
roses
paul
looked
into
miriam
eyes
she
was
pale
and
expectant
with
wonder
her
lips
were
parted
and
her
dark
eyes
lay
open
to
him
his
look
seemed
to
travel
down
into
her
her
soul
quivered
it
was
the
communion
she
wanted
he
turned
aside
as
if
pained
he
turned
to
the
bush
they
seem
as
if
they
walk
like
butterflies
and
shake
themselves
he
said
she
looked
at
her
roses
they
were
white
some
incurved
and
holy
others
expanded
in
an
ecstasy
the
tree
was
dark
as
a
shadow
she
lifted
her
hand
impulsively
to
the
flowers
she
went
forward
and
touched
them
in
worship
let
us
go
he
said
there
was
a
cool
scent
of
ivory
roses
a
white
virgin
scent
something
made
him
feel
anxious
and
imprisoned
the
two
walked
in
silence
till
sunday
he
said
quietly
and
left
her
and
she
walked
home
slowly
feeling
her
soul
satisfied
with
the
holiness
of
the
night
he
stumbled
down
the
path
and
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
the
wood
in
the
free
open
meadow
where
he
could
breathe
he
started
to
run
as
fast
as
he
could
it
was
like
a
delicious
delirium
in
his
veins
always
when
he
went
with
miriam
and
it
grew
rather
late
he
knew
his
mother
was
fretting
and
getting
angry
about
him
why
he
could
not
understand
as
he
went
into
the
house
flinging
down
his
cap
his
mother
looked
up
at
the
clock
she
had
been
sitting
thinking
because
a
chill
to
her
eyes
prevented
her
reading
she
could
feel
paul
being
drawn
away
by
this
girl
and
she
did
not
care
for
miriam
she
is
one
of
those
who
will
want
to
suck
a
man
soul
out
till
he
has
none
of
his
own
left
she
said
to
herself
and
he
is
just
such
a
gaby
as
to
let
himself
be
absorbed
she
will
never
let
him
become
a
man
she
never
so
while
he
was
away
with
miriam
morel
grew
more
and
more
worked
up
she
glanced
at
the
clock
and
said
coldly
and
rather
tired
you
have
been
far
enough
his
soul
warm
and
exposed
from
contact
with
the
girl
shrank
you
must
have
been
right
home
with
her
his
mother
continued
he
would
not
answer
morel
looking
at
him
quickly
saw
his
hair
was
damp
on
his
forehead
with
haste
saw
him
frowning
in
his
heavy
fashion
resentfully
she
must
be
wonderfully
fascinating
that
you
ca
get
away
from
her
but
must
go
trailing
eight
miles
at
this
time
of
he
was
hurt
between
the
past
glamour
with
miriam
and
the
knowledge
that
his
mother
fretted
he
had
meant
not
to
say
anything
to
refuse
to
answer
but
he
could
not
harden
his
heart
to
ignore
his
mother
i
do
like
to
talk
to
her
he
answered
irritably
is
there
nobody
else
to
talk
to
you
would
say
anything
if
i
went
with
you
know
i
should
you
know
whoever
you
went
with
i
should
say
it
was
too
far
for
you
to
go
trailing
late
at
night
when
you
been
to
nottingham
besides
her
voice
suddenly
flashed
into
anger
and
contempt
it
is
disgusting
bits
of
lads
and
girls
it
is
not
courting
he
cried
i
do
know
what
else
you
call
it
not
do
you
think
we
spoon
and
do
we
only
till
goodness
knows
what
time
and
distance
was
the
sarcastic
rejoinder
paul
snapped
at
the
laces
of
his
boots
angrily
what
are
you
so
mad
about
he
asked
because
you
do
like
i
do
say
i
do
like
her
but
i
do
hold
with
children
keeping
company
and
never
but
you
do
mind
our
annie
going
out
with
jim
they
more
sense
than
you
why
our
annie
not
one
of
the
deep
he
failed
to
see
the
meaning
of
this
remark
but
his
mother
looked
tired
she
was
never
so
strong
after
william
death
and
her
eyes
hurt
her
well
he
said
it
so
pretty
in
the
country
sleath
asked
about
you
he
said
he
missed
you
are
you
a
bit
better
i
ought
to
have
been
in
bed
a
long
time
ago
she
replied
why
mother
you
know
you
would
have
gone
before
oh
yes
i
should
oh
little
woman
you
say
anything
now
you
disagreeable
with
me
would
you
he
kissed
her
forehead
that
he
knew
so
well
the
deep
marks
between
the
brows
the
rising
of
the
fine
hair
greying
now
and
the
proud
setting
of
the
temples
his
hand
lingered
on
her
shoulder
after
his
kiss
then
he
went
slowly
to
bed
he
had
forgotten
miriam
he
only
saw
how
his
mother
hair
was
lifted
back
from
her
warm
broad
brow
and
somehow
she
was
hurt
then
the
next
time
he
saw
miriam
he
said
to
her
do
let
me
be
late
not
later
than
ten
my
mother
gets
so
miriam
dropped
her
bead
brooding
why
does
she
get
upset
she
asked
because
she
says
i
ought
to
be
out
late
when
i
have
to
get
up
very
well
said
miriam
rather
quietly
with
just
a
touch
of
a
sneer
he
resented
that
and
he
was
usually
late
again
that
there
was
any
love
growing
between
him
and
miriam
neither
of
them
would
have
acknowledged
he
thought
he
was
too
sane
for
such
sentimentality
and
she
thought
herself
too
lofty
they
both
were
late
in
coming
to
maturity
and
psychical
ripeness
was
much
behind
even
the
physical
miriam
was
exceedingly
sensitive
as
her
mother
had
always
been
the
slightest
grossness
made
her
recoil
almost
in
anguish
her
brothers
were
brutal
but
never
coarse
in
speech
the
men
did
all
the
discussing
of
farm
matters
outside
but
perhaps
because
of
the
continual
business
of
birth
and
of
begetting
which
goes
on
upon
every
farm
miriam
was
the
more
hypersensitive
to
the
matter
and
her
blood
was
chastened
almost
to
disgust
of
the
faintest
suggestion
of
such
intercourse
paul
took
his
pitch
from
her
and
their
intimacy
went
on
in
an
utterly
blanched
and
chaste
fashion
it
could
never
be
mentioned
that
the
mare
was
in
foal
when
he
was
nineteen
he
was
earning
only
twenty
shillings
a
week
but
he
was
happy
his
painting
went
well
and
life
went
well
enough
on
the
good
friday
he
organised
a
walk
to
the
hemlock
stone
there
were
three
lads
of
his
own
age
then
annie
and
arthur
miriam
and
geoffrey
arthur
apprenticed
as
an
electrician
in
nottingham
was
home
for
the
holiday
morel
as
usual
was
up
early
whistling
and
sawing
in
the
yard
at
seven
the
family
heard
him
buy
threepennyworth
of
buns
he
talked
with
gusto
to
the
little
girl
who
brought
them
calling
her
my
darling
he
turned
away
several
boys
who
came
with
more
buns
telling
them
they
had
been
kested
by
a
little
lass
then
morel
got
up
and
the
family
straggled
down
it
was
an
immense
luxury
to
everybody
this
lying
in
bed
just
beyond
the
ordinary
time
on
a
weekday
and
paul
and
arthur
read
before
breakfast
and
had
the
meal
unwashed
sitting
in
their
this
was
another
holiday
luxury
the
room
was
warm
everything
felt
free
of
care
and
anxiety
there
was
a
sense
of
plenty
in
the
house
while
the
boys
were
reading
morel
went
into
the
garden
they
were
now
in
another
house
an
old
one
near
the
scargill
street
home
which
had
been
left
soon
after
william
had
died
directly
came
an
excited
cry
from
the
garden
paul
paul
come
and
look
it
was
his
mother
voice
he
threw
down
his
book
and
went
out
there
was
a
long
garden
that
ran
to
a
field
it
was
a
grey
cold
day
with
a
sharp
wind
blowing
out
of
derbyshire
two
fields
away
bestwood
began
with
a
jumble
of
roofs
and
red
out
of
which
rose
the
church
tower
and
the
spire
of
the
congregational
chapel
and
beyond
went
woods
and
hills
right
away
to
the
pale
grey
heights
of
the
pennine
chain
paul
looked
down
the
garden
for
his
mother
her
head
appeared
among
the
young
come
here
she
cried
what
for
he
answered
come
and
she
had
been
looking
at
the
buds
on
the
currant
trees
paul
went
up
to
think
she
said
that
here
i
might
never
have
seen
them
her
son
went
to
her
side
under
the
fence
in
a
little
bed
was
a
ravel
of
poor
grassy
leaves
such
as
come
from
very
immature
bulbs
and
three
scyllas
in
bloom
morel
pointed
to
the
deep
blue
flowers
now
just
see
those
she
exclaimed
i
was
looking
at
the
currant
bushes
when
thinks
i
to
myself
something
very
blue
is
it
a
bit
of
and
there
behold
you
three
glories
of
the
snow
and
such
beauties
but
where
on
earth
did
they
come
from
i
do
know
said
paul
well
that
a
marvel
now
i
thought
i
knew
every
weed
and
blade
in
this
garden
but
have
they
done
well
you
see
that
just
shelters
them
not
nipped
not
touched
he
crouched
down
and
turned
up
the
bells
of
the
little
blue
flowers
they
a
glorious
colour
he
said
are
they
she
cried
i
guess
they
come
from
switzerland
where
they
say
they
have
such
lovely
things
fancy
them
against
the
snow
but
where
have
they
come
from
they
ca
have
blown
here
can
they
then
he
remembered
having
set
here
a
lot
of
little
trash
of
bulbs
to
mature
and
you
never
told
me
she
said
no
i
thought
i
leave
it
till
they
might
and
now
you
see
i
might
have
missed
them
and
i
never
had
a
glory
of
the
snow
in
my
garden
in
my
she
was
full
of
excitement
and
elation
the
garden
was
an
endless
joy
to
her
paul
was
thankful
for
her
sake
at
last
to
be
in
a
house
with
a
long
garden
that
went
down
to
a
field
every
morning
after
breakfast
she
went
out
and
was
happy
pottering
about
in
it
and
it
was
true
she
knew
every
weed
and
blade
everybody
turned
up
for
the
walk
food
was
packed
and
they
set
off
a
merry
delighted
party
they
hung
over
the
wall
of
the
dropped
paper
in
the
water
on
one
side
of
the
tunnel
and
watched
it
shoot
out
on
the
other
they
stood
on
the
over
boathouse
station
and
looked
at
the
metals
gleaming
coldly
you
should
see
the
flying
scotsman
come
through
at
six
said
leonard
whose
father
was
a
signalman
lad
but
she
does
half
buzz
and
the
little
party
looked
up
the
lines
one
way
to
london
and
the
other
way
to
scotland
and
they
felt
the
touch
of
these
two
magical
places
in
ilkeston
the
colliers
were
waiting
in
gangs
for
the
to
open
it
was
a
town
of
idleness
and
lounging
at
stanton
gate
the
iron
foundry
blazed
over
everything
there
were
great
discussions
at
trowell
they
crossed
again
from
derbyshire
into
nottinghamshire
they
came
to
the
hemlock
stone
at
its
field
was
crowded
with
folk
from
nottingham
and
ilkeston
they
had
expected
a
venerable
and
dignified
monument
they
found
a
little
gnarled
twisted
stump
of
rock
something
like
a
decayed
mushroom
standing
out
pathetically
on
the
side
of
a
field
leonard
and
dick
immediately
proceeded
to
carve
their
initials
l
and
r
in
the
old
red
sandstone
but
paul
desisted
because
he
had
read
in
the
newspaper
satirical
remarks
about
who
could
find
no
other
road
to
immortality
then
all
the
lads
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
rock
to
look
round
everywhere
in
the
field
below
factory
girls
and
lads
were
eating
lunch
or
sporting
about
beyond
was
the
garden
of
an
old
manor
it
had
and
thick
clumps
and
borders
of
yellow
crocuses
round
the
lawn
see
said
paul
to
miriam
what
a
quiet
garden
she
saw
the
dark
yews
and
the
golden
crocuses
then
she
looked
gratefully
he
had
not
seemed
to
belong
to
her
among
all
these
others
he
was
different
then
not
her
paul
who
understood
the
slightest
quiver
of
her
innermost
soul
but
something
else
speaking
another
language
than
hers
how
it
hurt
her
and
deadened
her
very
perceptions
only
when
he
came
right
back
to
her
leaving
his
other
his
lesser
self
as
she
thought
would
she
feel
alive
again
and
now
he
asked
her
to
look
at
this
garden
wanting
the
contact
with
her
again
impatient
of
the
set
in
the
field
she
turned
to
the
quiet
lawn
surrounded
by
sheaves
of
crocuses
a
feeling
of
stillness
almost
of
ecstasy
came
over
her
it
felt
almost
as
if
she
were
alone
with
him
in
this
garden
then
he
left
her
again
and
joined
the
others
soon
they
started
home
miriam
loitered
behind
alone
she
did
not
fit
in
with
the
others
she
could
very
rarely
get
into
human
relations
with
anyone
so
her
friend
her
companion
her
lover
was
nature
she
saw
the
sun
declining
wanly
in
the
dusky
cold
hedgerows
were
some
red
leaves
she
lingered
to
gather
them
tenderly
passionately
the
love
in
her
caressed
the
leaves
the
passion
in
her
heart
came
to
a
glow
upon
the
leaves
suddenly
she
realised
she
was
alone
in
a
strange
road
and
she
hurried
forward
turning
a
corner
in
the
lane
she
came
upon
paul
who
stood
bent
over
something
his
mind
fixed
on
it
working
away
steadily
patiently
a
little
hopelessly
she
hesitated
in
her
approach
to
watch
he
remained
concentrated
in
the
middle
of
the
road
beyond
one
rift
of
rich
gold
in
that
colourless
grey
evening
seemed
to
make
him
stand
out
in
dark
relief
she
saw
him
slender
and
firm
as
if
the
setting
sun
had
given
him
to
her
a
deep
pain
took
hold
of
her
and
she
knew
she
must
love
him
and
she
had
discovered
him
discovered
in
him
a
rare
potentiality
discovered
his
loneliness
quivering
as
at
some
annunciation
she
went
slowly
forward
at
last
he
looked
up
why
he
exclaimed
gratefully
have
you
waited
for
me
she
saw
a
deep
shadow
in
his
eyes
what
is
it
she
asked
the
spring
broken
here
and
he
showed
her
where
his
umbrella
was
injured
instantly
with
some
shame
she
knew
he
had
not
done
the
damage
himself
but
that
geoffrey
was
responsible
it
is
only
an
old
umbrella
is
it
she
asked
she
wondered
why
he
who
did
not
usually
trouble
over
trifles
made
such
a
mountain
of
this
molehill
but
it
was
william
an
my
mother
ca
help
but
know
he
said
quietly
still
patiently
working
at
the
umbrella
the
words
went
through
miriam
like
a
blade
this
then
was
the
confirmation
of
her
vision
of
him
she
looked
at
him
but
there
was
about
him
a
certain
reserve
and
she
dared
not
comfort
him
not
even
speak
softly
to
him
come
on
he
said
i
ca
do
it
and
they
went
in
silence
along
the
road
that
same
evening
they
were
walking
along
under
the
trees
by
nether
green
he
was
talking
to
her
fretfully
seemed
to
be
struggling
to
convince
himself
you
know
he
said
with
an
effort
if
one
person
loves
the
other
ah
she
answered
like
mother
said
to
me
when
i
was
little
begets
love
yes
something
like
that
i
think
it
must
i
hope
so
because
if
it
were
not
love
might
be
a
very
terrible
thing
she
said
yes
but
it
is
at
least
with
most
people
he
answered
and
miriam
thinking
he
had
assured
himself
felt
strong
in
herself
she
always
regarded
that
sudden
coming
upon
him
in
the
lane
as
a
revelation
and
this
conversation
remained
graven
in
her
mind
as
one
of
the
letters
of
the
law
now
she
stood
with
him
and
for
him
when
about
this
time
he
outraged
the
family
feeling
at
willey
farm
by
some
overbearing
insult
she
stuck
to
him
and
believed
he
was
right
and
at
this
time
she
dreamed
dreams
of
him
vivid
unforgettable
these
dreams
came
again
later
on
developed
to
a
more
subtle
psychological
stage
on
the
easter
monday
the
same
party
took
an
excursion
to
wingfield
manor
it
was
great
excitement
to
miriam
to
catch
a
train
at
sethley
bridge
amid
all
the
bustle
of
the
bank
holiday
crowd
they
left
the
train
at
alfreton
paul
was
interested
in
the
street
and
in
the
colliers
with
their
dogs
here
was
a
new
race
of
miners
miriam
did
not
live
till
they
came
to
the
church
they
were
all
rather
timid
of
entering
with
their
bags
of
food
for
fear
of
being
turned
out
leonard
a
comic
thin
fellow
went
first
paul
who
would
have
died
rather
than
be
sent
back
went
last
the
place
was
decorated
for
easter
in
the
font
hundreds
of
white
narcissi
seemed
to
be
growing
the
air
was
dim
and
coloured
from
the
windows
and
thrilled
with
a
subtle
scent
of
lilies
and
narcissi
in
that
atmosphere
miriam
soul
came
into
a
glow
paul
was
afraid
of
the
things
he
must
do
and
he
was
sensitive
to
the
feel
of
the
place
miriam
turned
to
him
he
answered
they
were
together
he
would
not
go
beyond
the
she
loved
him
for
that
her
soul
expanded
into
prayer
beside
him
he
felt
the
strange
fascination
of
shadowy
religious
places
all
his
latent
mysticism
quivered
into
life
she
was
drawn
to
him
he
was
a
prayer
along
with
her
miriam
very
rarely
talked
to
the
other
lads
they
at
once
became
awkward
in
conversation
with
her
so
usually
she
was
silent
it
was
past
midday
when
they
climbed
the
steep
path
to
the
manor
all
things
shone
softly
in
the
sun
which
was
wonderfully
warm
and
enlivening
celandines
and
violets
were
out
everybody
was
full
with
happiness
the
glitter
of
the
ivy
the
soft
atmospheric
grey
of
the
castle
walls
the
gentleness
of
everything
near
the
ruin
was
perfect
the
manor
is
of
hard
pale
grey
stone
and
the
other
walls
are
blank
and
calm
the
young
folk
were
in
raptures
they
went
in
trepidation
almost
afraid
that
the
delight
of
exploring
this
ruin
might
be
denied
them
in
the
first
courtyard
within
the
high
broken
walls
were
with
their
shafts
lying
idle
on
the
ground
the
tyres
of
the
wheels
brilliant
with
rust
it
was
very
still
all
eagerly
paid
their
sixpences
and
went
timidly
through
the
fine
clean
arch
of
the
inner
courtyard
they
were
shy
here
on
the
pavement
where
the
hall
had
been
an
old
thorn
tree
was
budding
all
kinds
of
strange
openings
and
broken
rooms
were
in
the
shadow
around
them
after
lunch
they
set
off
once
more
to
explore
the
ruin
this
time
the
girls
went
with
the
boys
who
could
act
as
guides
and
expositors
there
was
one
tall
tower
in
a
corner
rather
tottering
where
they
say
mary
queen
of
scots
was
imprisoned
think
of
the
queen
going
up
here
said
miriam
in
a
low
voice
as
she
climbed
the
hollow
stairs
if
she
could
get
up
said
paul
for
she
had
rheumatism
like
anything
i
reckon
they
treated
her
you
do
think
she
deserved
it
asked
miriam
no
i
do
she
was
only
they
continued
to
mount
the
winding
staircase
a
high
wind
blowing
through
the
loopholes
went
rushing
up
the
shaft
and
filled
the
skirts
like
a
balloon
so
that
she
was
ashamed
until
he
took
the
hem
of
her
dress
and
held
it
down
for
her
he
did
it
perfectly
simply
as
he
would
have
picked
up
her
glove
she
remembered
this
always
round
the
broken
top
of
the
tower
the
ivy
bushed
out
old
and
handsome
also
there
were
a
few
chill
gillivers
in
pale
cold
bud
miriam
wanted
to
lean
over
for
some
ivy
but
he
would
not
let
her
instead
she
had
to
wait
behind
him
and
take
from
him
each
spray
as
he
gathered
it
and
held
it
to
her
each
one
separately
in
the
purest
manner
of
chivalry
the
tower
seemed
to
rock
in
the
wind
they
looked
over
miles
and
miles
of
wooded
country
and
country
with
gleams
of
pasture
the
crypt
underneath
the
manor
was
beautiful
and
in
perfect
preservation
paul
made
a
drawing
miriam
stayed
with
him
she
was
thinking
of
mary
queen
of
scots
looking
with
her
strained
hopeless
eyes
that
could
not
understand
misery
over
the
hills
whence
no
help
came
or
sitting
in
this
crypt
being
told
of
a
god
as
cold
as
the
place
she
sat
in
they
set
off
again
gaily
looking
round
on
their
beloved
manor
that
stood
so
clean
and
big
on
its
hill
supposing
you
could
have
that
farm
said
paul
to
miriam
yes
would
it
be
lovely
to
come
and
see
you
they
were
now
in
the
bare
country
of
stone
walls
which
he
loved
and
which
though
only
ten
miles
from
home
seemed
so
foreign
to
miriam
the
party
was
straggling
as
they
were
crossing
a
large
meadow
that
sloped
away
from
the
sun
along
a
path
embedded
with
innumerable
tiny
glittering
points
paul
walking
alongside
laced
his
fingers
in
the
strings
of
the
bag
miriam
was
carrying
and
instantly
she
felt
annie
behind
watchful
and
jealous
but
the
meadow
was
bathed
in
a
glory
of
sunshine
and
the
path
was
jewelled
and
it
was
seldom
that
he
gave
her
any
sign
she
held
her
fingers
very
still
among
the
strings
of
the
bag
his
fingers
touching
and
the
place
was
golden
as
a
vision
at
last
they
came
into
the
straggling
grey
village
of
crich
that
lies
high
beyond
the
village
was
the
famous
crich
stand
that
paul
could
see
from
the
garden
at
home
the
party
pushed
on
great
expanse
of
country
spread
around
and
below
the
lads
were
eager
to
get
to
the
top
of
the
hill
it
was
capped
by
a
round
knoll
half
of
which
was
by
now
cut
away
and
on
the
top
of
which
stood
an
ancient
monument
sturdy
and
squat
for
signalling
in
old
days
far
down
into
the
level
lands
of
nottinghamshire
and
leicestershire
it
was
blowing
so
hard
high
up
there
in
the
exposed
place
that
the
only
way
to
be
safe
was
to
stand
nailed
by
the
wind
to
the
wan
of
the
tower
at
their
feet
fell
the
precipice
where
the
limestone
was
quarried
away
below
was
a
jumble
of
hills
and
tiny
villages
mattock
ambergate
stoney
middleton
the
lads
were
eager
to
spy
out
the
church
of
bestwood
far
away
among
the
rather
crowded
country
on
the
left
they
were
disgusted
that
it
seemed
to
stand
on
a
plain
they
saw
the
hills
of
derbyshire
fall
into
the
monotony
of
the
midlands
that
swept
away
south
miriam
was
somewhat
scared
by
the
wind
but
the
lads
enjoyed
it
they
went
on
miles
and
miles
to
whatstandwell
all
the
food
was
eaten
everybody
was
hungry
and
there
was
very
little
money
to
get
home
with
but
they
managed
to
procure
a
loaf
and
a
which
they
hacked
to
pieces
with
and
ate
sitting
on
the
wall
near
the
bridge
watching
the
bright
derwent
rushing
by
and
the
brakes
from
matlock
pulling
up
at
the
inn
paul
was
now
pale
with
weariness
he
had
been
responsible
for
the
party
all
day
and
now
he
was
done
miriam
understood
and
kept
close
to
him
and
he
left
himself
in
her
hands
they
had
an
hour
to
wait
at
ambergate
station
trains
came
crowded
with
excursionists
returning
to
manchester
birmingham
and
london
we
might
be
going
there
folk
easily
might
think
we
going
that
far
said
paul
they
got
back
rather
late
miriam
walking
home
with
geoffrey
watched
the
moon
rise
big
and
red
and
misty
she
felt
something
was
fulfilled
in
her
she
had
an
elder
sister
agatha
who
was
a
between
the
two
girls
was
a
feud
miriam
considered
agatha
worldly
and
she
wanted
herself
to
be
a
one
saturday
afternoon
agatha
and
miriam
were
upstairs
dressing
their
bedroom
was
over
the
stable
it
was
a
low
room
not
very
large
and
bare
miriam
had
nailed
on
the
wall
a
reproduction
of
veronese
st
catherine
she
loved
the
woman
who
sat
in
the
window
dreaming
her
own
windows
were
too
small
to
sit
in
but
the
front
one
was
dripped
over
with
honeysuckle
and
virginia
creeper
and
looked
upon
the
of
the
across
the
yard
while
the
little
back
window
no
bigger
than
a
handkerchief
was
a
loophole
to
the
east
to
the
dawn
beating
up
against
the
beloved
round
hills
the
two
sisters
did
not
talk
much
to
each
other
agatha
who
was
fair
and
small
and
determined
had
rebelled
against
the
home
atmosphere
against
the
doctrine
of
the
other
cheek
she
was
out
in
the
world
now
in
a
fair
way
to
be
independent
and
she
insisted
on
worldly
values
on
appearance
on
manners
on
position
which
miriam
would
fain
have
ignored
both
girls
liked
to
be
upstairs
out
of
the
way
when
paul
came
they
preferred
to
come
running
down
open
the
door
and
see
him
watching
expectant
of
them
miriam
stood
painfully
pulling
over
her
head
a
rosary
he
had
given
her
it
caught
in
the
fine
mesh
of
her
hair
but
at
last
she
had
it
on
and
the
wooden
beads
looked
well
against
her
cool
brown
neck
she
was
a
girl
and
very
handsome
but
in
the
little
nailed
against
the
whitewashed
wall
she
could
only
see
a
fragment
of
herself
at
a
time
agatha
had
bought
a
little
mirror
of
her
own
which
she
propped
up
to
suit
herself
miriam
was
near
the
window
suddenly
she
heard
the
click
of
the
chain
and
she
saw
paul
fling
open
the
gate
push
his
bicycle
into
the
yard
she
saw
him
look
at
the
house
and
she
shrank
away
he
walked
in
a
nonchalant
fashion
and
his
bicycle
went
with
him
as
if
it
were
a
live
thing
paul
come
she
exclaimed
are
you
glad
said
agatha
cuttingly
miriam
stood
still
in
amazement
and
bewilderment
well
are
you
she
asked
yes
but
i
not
going
to
let
him
see
it
and
think
i
wanted
miriam
was
startled
she
heard
him
putting
his
bicycle
in
the
stable
underneath
and
talking
to
jimmy
who
had
been
a
and
who
was
seedy
well
jimmy
my
lad
how
are
ter
nobbut
sick
an
sadly
like
why
then
it
a
shame
my
owd
she
heard
the
rope
run
through
the
hole
as
the
horse
lifted
its
head
from
the
lad
caress
how
she
loved
to
listen
when
he
thought
only
the
horse
could
hear
but
there
was
a
serpent
in
her
eden
she
searched
earnestly
in
herself
to
see
if
she
wanted
paul
morel
she
felt
there
would
be
some
disgrace
in
it
full
of
twisted
feeling
she
was
afraid
she
did
want
him
she
stood
then
came
an
agony
of
new
shame
she
shrank
within
herself
in
a
coil
of
torture
did
she
want
paul
morel
and
did
he
know
she
wanted
him
what
a
subtle
infamy
upon
her
she
felt
as
if
her
whole
soul
coiled
into
knots
of
shame
agatha
was
dressed
first
and
ran
downstairs
miriam
heard
her
greet
the
lad
gaily
knew
exactly
how
brilliant
her
grey
eyes
became
with
that
tone
she
herself
would
have
felt
it
bold
to
have
greeted
him
in
such
wise
yet
there
she
stood
under
the
of
wanting
him
tied
to
that
stake
of
torture
in
bitter
perplexity
she
kneeled
down
and
prayed
o
lord
let
me
not
love
paul
morel
keep
me
from
loving
him
if
i
ought
not
to
love
something
anomalous
in
the
prayer
arrested
her
she
lifted
her
head
and
pondered
how
could
it
be
wrong
to
love
him
love
was
god
gift
and
yet
it
caused
her
shame
that
was
because
of
him
paul
morel
but
then
it
was
not
his
affair
it
was
her
own
between
herself
and
god
she
was
to
be
a
sacrifice
but
it
was
god
sacrifice
not
paul
morel
or
her
own
after
a
few
minutes
she
hid
her
face
in
the
pillow
again
and
said
but
lord
if
it
is
thy
will
that
i
should
love
him
make
me
love
him
as
christ
would
who
died
for
the
souls
of
men
make
me
love
him
splendidly
because
he
is
thy
she
remained
kneeling
for
some
time
quite
still
and
deeply
moved
her
black
hair
against
the
red
squares
and
the
squares
of
the
patchwork
quilt
prayer
was
almost
essential
to
her
then
she
fell
into
that
rapture
of
identifying
herself
with
a
god
who
was
sacrificed
which
gives
to
so
many
human
souls
their
deepest
bliss
when
she
went
downstairs
paul
was
lying
back
in
an
armchair
holding
forth
with
much
vehemence
to
agatha
who
was
scorning
a
little
painting
he
had
brought
to
show
her
miriam
glanced
at
the
two
and
avoided
their
levity
she
went
into
the
parlour
to
be
alone
it
was
before
she
was
able
to
speak
to
paul
and
then
her
manner
was
so
distant
he
thought
he
had
offended
her
miriam
discontinued
her
practice
of
going
each
thursday
evening
to
the
library
in
bestwood
after
calling
for
paul
regularly
during
the
whole
spring
a
number
of
trifling
incidents
and
tiny
insults
from
his
family
awakened
her
to
their
attitude
towards
her
and
she
decided
to
go
no
more
so
she
announced
to
paul
one
evening
she
would
not
call
at
his
house
again
for
him
on
thursday
nights
why
he
asked
very
short
nothing
only
i
rather
very
but
she
faltered
if
you
care
to
meet
me
we
could
still
go
meet
you
where
somewhere
where
you
i
sha
meet
you
anywhere
i
do
see
why
you
should
keep
calling
for
me
but
if
you
wo
i
do
want
to
meet
so
the
thursday
evenings
which
had
been
so
precious
to
her
and
to
him
were
dropped
he
worked
instead
morel
sniffed
with
satisfaction
at
this
arrangement
he
would
not
have
it
that
they
were
lovers
the
intimacy
between
them
had
been
kept
so
abstract
such
a
matter
of
the
soul
all
thought
and
weary
struggle
into
consciousness
that
he
saw
it
only
as
a
platonic
friendship
he
stoutly
denied
there
was
anything
else
between
them
miriam
was
silent
or
else
she
very
quietly
agreed
he
was
a
fool
who
did
not
know
what
was
happening
to
himself
by
tacit
agreement
they
ignored
the
remarks
and
insinuations
of
their
acquaintances
we
are
lovers
we
are
friends
he
said
to
her
we
know
it
let
them
talk
what
does
it
matter
what
they
sometimes
as
they
were
walking
together
she
slipped
her
arm
timidly
into
his
but
he
always
resented
it
and
she
knew
it
it
caused
a
violent
conflict
in
him
with
miriam
he
was
always
on
the
high
plane
of
abstraction
when
his
natural
fire
of
love
was
transmitted
into
the
fine
stream
of
thought
she
would
have
it
so
if
he
were
jolly
and
as
she
put
it
flippant
she
waited
till
he
came
back
to
her
till
the
change
had
taken
place
in
him
again
and
he
was
wrestling
with
his
own
soul
frowning
passionate
in
his
desire
for
understanding
and
in
this
passion
for
understanding
her
soul
lay
close
to
his
she
had
him
all
to
herself
but
he
must
be
made
abstract
first
then
if
she
put
her
arm
in
his
it
caused
him
almost
torture
his
consciousness
seemed
to
split
the
place
where
she
was
touching
him
ran
hot
with
friction
he
was
one
internecine
battle
and
he
became
cruel
to
her
because
of
it
one
evening
in
midsummer
miriam
called
at
the
house
warm
from
climbing
paul
was
alone
in
the
kitchen
his
mother
could
be
heard
moving
about
upstairs
come
and
look
at
the
he
said
to
the
girl
they
went
into
the
garden
the
sky
behind
the
townlet
and
the
church
was
the
was
flooded
with
a
strange
warm
light
that
lifted
every
leaf
into
significance
paul
passed
along
a
fine
row
of
gathering
a
blossom
here
and
there
all
cream
and
pale
blue
miriam
followed
breathing
the
fragrance
to
her
flowers
appealed
with
such
strength
she
felt
she
must
make
them
part
of
herself
when
she
bent
and
breathed
a
flower
it
was
as
if
she
and
the
flower
were
loving
each
other
paul
hated
her
for
it
there
seemed
a
sort
of
exposure
about
the
action
something
too
intimate
when
he
had
got
a
fair
bunch
they
returned
to
the
house
he
listened
for
a
moment
to
his
mother
quiet
movement
upstairs
then
he
said
come
here
and
let
me
pin
them
in
for
he
arranged
them
two
or
three
at
a
time
in
the
bosom
of
her
dress
stepping
back
now
and
then
to
see
the
effect
you
know
he
said
taking
the
pin
out
of
his
mouth
a
woman
ought
always
to
arrange
her
flowers
before
her
miriam
laughed
she
thought
flowers
ought
to
be
pinned
in
one
dress
without
any
care
that
paul
should
take
pains
to
fix
her
flowers
for
her
was
his
whim
he
was
rather
offended
at
her
laughter
some
women
do
those
who
look
decent
he
said
miriam
laughed
again
but
mirthlessly
to
hear
him
thus
mix
her
up
with
women
in
a
general
way
from
most
men
she
would
have
ignored
it
but
from
him
it
hurt
her
he
had
nearly
finished
arranging
the
flowers
when
he
heard
his
footstep
on
the
stairs
hurriedly
he
pushed
in
the
last
pin
and
turned
away
do
let
mater
know
he
said
miriam
picked
up
her
books
and
stood
in
the
doorway
looking
with
chagrin
at
the
beautiful
sunset
she
would
call
for
paul
no
more
she
said
morel
she
said
in
a
deferential
way
she
sounded
as
if
she
felt
she
had
no
right
to
be
there
oh
is
it
you
miriam
replied
morel
coolly
but
paul
insisted
on
everybody
accepting
his
friendship
with
the
girl
and
morel
was
too
wise
to
have
any
open
rupture
it
was
not
till
he
was
twenty
years
old
that
the
family
could
ever
afford
to
go
away
for
a
holiday
morel
had
never
been
away
for
a
holiday
except
to
see
her
sister
since
she
had
been
married
now
at
last
paul
had
saved
enough
money
and
they
were
all
going
there
was
to
be
a
party
some
of
annie
friends
one
friend
of
paul
a
young
man
in
the
same
office
where
william
had
previously
been
and
miriam
it
was
great
excitement
writing
for
rooms
paul
and
his
mother
debated
it
endlessly
between
them
they
wanted
a
furnished
cottage
for
two
weeks
she
thought
one
week
would
be
enough
but
he
insisted
on
two
at
last
they
got
an
answer
from
mablethorpe
a
cottage
such
as
they
wished
for
thirty
shillings
a
week
there
was
immense
jubilation
paul
was
wild
with
joy
for
his
mother
sake
she
would
have
a
real
holiday
now
he
and
she
sat
at
evening
picturing
what
it
would
be
like
annie
came
in
and
leonard
and
alice
and
kitty
there
was
wild
rejoicing
and
anticipation
paul
told
miriam
she
seemed
to
brood
with
joy
over
it
but
the
morel
house
rang
with
excitement
they
were
to
go
on
saturday
morning
by
the
seven
train
paul
suggested
that
miriam
should
sleep
at
his
house
because
it
was
so
far
for
her
to
walk
she
came
down
for
supper
everybody
was
so
excited
that
even
miriam
was
accepted
with
warmth
but
almost
as
soon
as
she
entered
the
feeling
in
the
family
became
close
and
tight
he
had
discovered
a
poem
by
jean
ingelow
which
mentioned
mablethorpe
and
so
he
must
read
it
to
miriam
he
would
never
have
got
so
far
in
the
direction
of
sentimentality
as
to
read
poetry
to
his
own
family
but
now
they
condescended
to
listen
miriam
sat
on
the
sofa
absorbed
in
him
she
always
seemed
absorbed
in
him
and
by
him
when
he
was
present
morel
sat
jealously
in
her
own
chair
she
was
going
to
hear
also
and
even
annie
and
the
father
attended
morel
with
his
head
cocked
on
one
side
like
somebody
listening
to
a
sermon
and
feeling
conscious
of
the
fact
paul
ducked
his
head
over
the
book
he
had
got
now
all
the
audience
he
cared
for
and
morel
and
annie
almost
contested
with
miriam
who
should
listen
best
and
win
his
favour
he
was
in
very
high
feather
but
interrupted
morel
what
is
the
of
enderby
that
the
bells
are
supposed
to
ring
it
an
old
tune
they
used
to
play
on
the
bells
for
a
warning
against
water
i
suppose
the
bride
of
enderby
was
drowned
in
a
flood
he
replied
he
had
not
the
faintest
knowledge
what
it
really
was
but
he
would
never
have
sunk
so
low
as
to
confess
that
to
his
womenfolk
they
listened
and
believed
him
he
believed
himself
and
the
people
knew
what
that
tune
meant
said
his
mother
yes
just
like
the
scotch
when
they
heard
flowers
o
the
forest
and
when
they
used
to
ring
the
bells
backward
for
how
said
annie
a
bell
sounds
the
same
whether
it
rung
backwards
or
but
he
said
if
you
start
with
the
deep
bell
and
ring
up
to
the
high
one
der
der
der
der
der
der
der
der
he
ran
up
the
scale
everybody
thought
it
clever
he
thought
so
too
then
waiting
a
minute
he
continued
the
poem
hm
said
morel
curiously
when
he
finished
but
i
wish
everything
that
written
were
so
i
canna
see
what
they
want
drownin
theirselves
for
said
morel
there
was
a
pause
annie
got
up
to
clear
the
table
miriam
rose
to
help
with
the
pots
let
me
help
to
wash
up
she
said
certainly
not
cried
annie
you
sit
down
again
there
are
and
miriam
who
could
not
be
familiar
and
insist
sat
down
again
to
look
at
the
book
with
paul
he
was
master
of
the
party
his
father
was
no
good
and
great
tortures
he
suffered
lest
the
tin
box
should
be
put
out
at
firsby
instead
of
at
mablethorpe
and
he
was
equal
to
getting
a
carriage
his
bold
little
mother
did
that
here
she
cried
to
a
man
here
paul
and
annie
got
behind
the
rest
convulsed
with
shamed
laughter
how
much
will
it
be
to
drive
to
brook
cottage
said
morel
two
why
how
far
is
it
a
good
i
do
believe
it
she
said
but
she
scrambled
in
there
were
eight
crowded
in
one
old
seaside
carriage
you
see
said
morel
it
only
threepence
each
and
if
it
were
a
tramcar
they
drove
along
each
cottage
they
came
to
morel
cried
is
it
this
now
this
is
it
everybody
sat
breathless
they
drove
past
there
was
a
universal
sigh
i
thankful
it
was
that
brute
said
morel
i
was
they
drove
on
and
on
at
last
they
descended
at
a
house
that
stood
alone
over
the
dyke
by
the
highroad
there
was
wild
excitement
because
they
had
to
cross
a
little
bridge
to
get
into
the
front
garden
but
they
loved
the
house
that
lay
so
solitary
with
a
on
one
side
and
immense
expanse
of
land
patched
in
white
barley
yellow
oats
red
wheat
and
green
flat
and
stretching
level
to
the
sky
paul
kept
accounts
he
and
his
mother
ran
the
show
the
total
expenses
lodging
food
everything
was
sixteen
shillings
a
week
per
person
he
and
leonard
went
bathing
in
the
mornings
morel
was
wandering
abroad
quite
early
you
paul
his
mother
called
from
the
bedroom
eat
a
piece
of
all
right
he
answered
and
when
he
got
back
he
saw
his
mother
presiding
in
state
at
the
the
woman
of
the
house
was
young
her
husband
was
blind
and
she
did
laundry
work
so
morel
always
washed
the
pots
in
the
kitchen
and
made
the
beds
but
you
said
you
have
a
real
holiday
said
paul
and
now
you
work
she
exclaimed
what
are
you
talking
about
he
loved
to
go
with
her
across
the
fields
to
the
village
and
the
sea
she
was
afraid
of
the
plank
bridge
and
he
abused
her
for
being
a
baby
on
the
whole
he
stuck
to
her
as
if
he
were
her
man
miriam
did
not
get
much
of
him
except
perhaps
when
all
the
others
went
to
the
coons
coons
were
insufferably
stupid
to
miriam
so
he
thought
they
were
to
himself
also
and
he
preached
priggishly
to
annie
about
the
fatuity
of
listening
to
them
yet
he
too
knew
all
their
songs
and
sang
them
along
the
roads
roisterously
and
if
he
found
himself
listening
the
stupidity
pleased
him
very
much
yet
to
annie
he
said
such
rot
there
is
a
grain
of
intelligence
in
it
nobody
with
more
gumption
than
a
grasshopper
could
go
and
sit
and
and
to
miriam
he
said
with
much
scorn
of
annie
and
the
others
i
suppose
they
at
the
it
was
queer
to
see
miriam
singing
coon
songs
she
had
a
straight
chin
that
went
in
a
perpendicular
line
from
the
lower
lip
to
the
turn
she
always
reminded
paul
of
some
sad
botticelli
angel
when
she
sang
even
when
it
was
come
down
lover
lane
for
a
walk
with
me
talk
with
only
when
he
sketched
or
at
evening
when
the
others
were
at
the
coons
she
had
him
to
herself
he
talked
to
her
endlessly
about
his
love
of
horizontals
how
they
the
great
levels
of
sky
and
land
in
lincolnshire
meant
to
him
the
eternality
of
the
will
just
as
the
bowed
norman
arches
of
the
church
repeating
themselves
meant
the
dogged
leaping
forward
of
the
persistent
human
soul
on
and
on
nobody
knows
where
in
contradiction
to
the
perpendicular
lines
and
to
the
gothic
arch
which
he
said
leapt
up
at
heaven
and
touched
the
ecstasy
and
lost
itself
in
the
divine
himself
he
said
was
norman
miriam
was
gothic
she
bowed
in
consent
even
to
that
one
evening
he
and
she
went
up
the
great
sweeping
shore
of
sand
towards
theddlethorpe
the
long
breakers
plunged
and
ran
in
a
hiss
of
foam
along
the
coast
it
was
a
warm
evening
there
was
not
a
figure
but
themselves
on
the
far
reaches
of
sand
no
noise
but
the
sound
of
the
sea
paul
loved
to
see
it
clanging
at
the
land
he
loved
to
feel
himself
between
the
noise
of
it
and
the
silence
of
the
sandy
shore
miriam
was
with
him
everything
grew
very
intense
it
was
quite
dark
when
they
turned
again
the
way
home
was
through
a
gap
in
the
sandhills
and
then
along
a
raised
grass
road
between
two
dykes
the
country
was
black
and
still
from
behind
the
sandhills
came
the
whisper
of
the
sea
paul
and
miriam
walked
in
silence
suddenly
he
started
the
whole
of
his
blood
seemed
to
burst
into
flame
and
he
could
scarcely
breathe
an
enormous
orange
moon
was
staring
at
them
from
the
rim
of
the
sandhills
he
stood
still
looking
at
it
ah
cried
miriam
when
she
saw
it
he
remained
perfectly
still
staring
at
the
immense
and
ruddy
moon
the
only
thing
in
the
darkness
of
the
level
his
heart
beat
heavily
the
muscles
of
his
arms
contracted
what
is
it
murmured
miriam
waiting
for
him
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
she
stood
beside
him
for
ever
in
shadow
her
face
covered
with
the
darkness
of
her
hat
was
watching
him
unseen
but
she
was
brooding
she
was
slightly
afraid
deeply
moved
and
religious
that
was
her
best
state
he
was
impotent
against
it
his
blood
was
concentrated
like
a
flame
in
his
chest
but
he
could
not
get
across
to
her
there
were
flashes
in
his
blood
but
somehow
she
ignored
them
she
was
expecting
some
religious
state
in
him
still
yearning
she
was
half
aware
of
his
passion
and
gazed
at
him
troubled
what
is
it
she
murmured
again
it
the
moon
he
answered
frowning
yes
she
assented
is
it
wonderful
she
was
curious
about
him
the
crisis
was
past
he
did
not
know
himself
what
was
the
matter
he
was
naturally
so
young
and
their
intimacy
was
so
abstract
he
did
not
know
he
wanted
to
crush
her
on
to
his
breast
to
ease
the
ache
there
he
was
afraid
of
her
the
fact
that
he
might
want
her
as
a
man
wants
a
woman
had
in
him
been
suppressed
into
a
shame
when
she
shrank
in
her
convulsed
coiled
torture
from
the
thought
of
such
a
thing
he
had
winced
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
and
now
this
purity
prevented
even
their
first
it
was
as
if
she
could
scarcely
stand
the
shock
of
physical
love
even
a
passionate
kiss
and
then
he
was
too
shrinking
and
sensitive
to
give
it
as
they
walked
along
the
dark
he
watched
the
moon
and
did
not
speak
she
plodded
beside
him
he
hated
her
for
she
seemed
in
some
way
to
make
him
despise
himself
looking
ahead
he
saw
the
one
light
in
the
darkness
the
window
of
their
cottage
he
loved
to
think
of
his
mother
and
the
other
jolly
people
well
everybody
else
has
been
in
long
ago
said
his
mother
as
they
entered
what
does
that
matter
he
cried
irritably
i
can
go
a
walk
if
i
like
ca
i
and
i
should
have
thought
you
could
get
in
to
supper
with
the
rest
said
morel
i
shall
please
myself
he
retorted
it
not
late
i
shall
do
as
i
very
well
said
his
mother
cuttingly
then
do
as
you
and
she
took
no
further
notice
of
him
that
evening
which
he
pretended
neither
to
notice
nor
to
care
about
but
sat
reading
miriam
read
also
obliterating
herself
morel
hated
her
for
making
her
son
like
this
she
watched
paul
growing
irritable
priggish
and
melancholic
for
this
she
put
the
blame
on
miriam
annie
and
all
her
friends
joined
against
the
girl
miriam
had
no
friend
of
her
own
only
paul
but
she
did
not
suffer
so
much
because
she
despised
the
triviality
of
these
other
people
and
paul
hated
her
because
somehow
she
spoilt
his
ease
and
naturalness
and
he
writhed
himself
with
a
feeling
of
humiliation
chapter
viii
strife
in
love
arthur
finished
his
apprenticeship
and
got
a
job
on
the
electrical
plant
at
minton
pit
he
earned
very
little
but
had
a
good
chance
of
getting
on
but
he
was
wild
and
restless
he
did
not
drink
nor
gamble
yet
he
somehow
contrived
to
get
into
endless
scrapes
always
through
some
thoughtlessness
either
he
went
rabbiting
in
the
woods
like
a
poacher
or
he
stayed
in
nottingham
all
night
instead
of
coming
home
or
he
miscalculated
his
dive
into
the
canal
at
bestwood
and
scored
his
chest
into
one
mass
of
wounds
on
the
raw
stones
and
tins
at
the
bottom
he
had
not
been
at
his
work
many
months
when
again
he
did
not
come
home
one
night
do
you
know
where
arthur
is
asked
paul
at
breakfast
i
do
not
replied
his
mother
he
is
a
fool
said
paul
and
if
he
did
anything
i
should
mind
but
no
he
simply
ca
come
away
from
a
game
of
whist
or
else
he
must
see
a
girl
home
from
the
quite
proprietously
and
so
ca
get
home
he
a
i
do
know
that
it
would
make
it
any
better
if
he
did
something
to
make
us
all
ashamed
said
morel
well
i
should
respect
him
more
said
paul
i
very
much
doubt
it
said
his
mother
coldly
they
went
on
with
breakfast
are
you
fearfully
fond
of
him
paul
asked
his
mother
what
do
you
ask
that
for
because
they
say
a
woman
always
like
the
youngest
she
may
do
but
i
do
no
he
wearies
and
you
actually
rather
he
was
good
i
rather
he
showed
some
of
a
man
common
paul
was
raw
and
irritable
he
also
wearied
his
mother
very
often
she
saw
the
sunshine
going
out
of
him
and
she
resented
it
as
they
were
finishing
breakfast
came
the
postman
with
a
letter
from
derby
morel
screwed
up
her
eyes
to
look
at
the
address
give
it
here
blind
eye
exclaimed
her
son
snatching
it
away
from
her
she
started
and
almost
boxed
his
ears
it
from
your
son
arthur
he
said
what
now
cried
morel
dearest
mother
paul
read
do
know
what
made
me
such
a
fool
i
want
you
to
come
and
fetch
me
back
from
here
i
came
with
jack
bredon
yesterday
instead
of
going
to
work
and
enlisted
he
said
he
was
sick
of
wearing
the
seat
of
a
stool
out
and
like
the
idiot
you
know
i
am
i
came
away
with
him
have
taken
the
king
shilling
but
perhaps
if
you
came
for
me
they
would
let
me
go
back
with
you
i
was
a
fool
when
i
did
it
i
do
want
to
be
in
the
army
my
dear
mother
i
am
nothing
but
a
trouble
to
you
but
if
you
get
me
out
of
this
i
promise
i
will
have
more
sense
and
consideration
morel
sat
down
in
her
well
now
she
cried
let
him
stop
yes
said
paul
let
him
there
was
silence
the
mother
sat
with
her
hands
folded
in
her
apron
her
face
set
thinking
if
i
not
sick
she
cried
suddenly
sick
now
said
paul
beginning
to
frown
you
not
going
to
worry
your
soul
out
about
this
do
you
i
suppose
i
to
take
it
as
a
blessing
she
flashed
turning
on
her
son
you
not
going
to
mount
it
up
to
a
tragedy
so
there
he
retorted
the
fool
the
young
fool
she
cried
he
look
well
in
uniform
said
paul
irritatingly
his
mother
turned
on
him
like
a
fury
oh
will
he
she
cried
not
in
my
eyes
he
should
get
in
a
cavalry
regiment
he
have
the
time
of
his
life
and
will
look
an
awful
swell
swell
a
mighty
swell
idea
indeed
a
common
soldier
well
said
paul
what
am
i
but
a
common
clerk
a
good
deal
my
boy
cried
his
mother
stung
what
at
any
rate
a
man
and
not
a
thing
in
a
red
i
should
mind
being
in
a
red
coat
or
dark
blue
that
would
suit
me
better
if
they
did
boss
me
about
too
but
his
mother
had
ceased
to
listen
just
as
he
was
getting
on
or
might
have
been
getting
on
at
his
job
a
young
nuisance
here
he
goes
and
ruins
himself
for
life
what
good
will
he
be
do
you
think
after
this
it
may
lick
him
into
shape
beautifully
said
paul
lick
him
into
shape
lick
what
marrow
there
was
out
of
his
bones
a
soldier
a
common
soldier
nothing
but
a
body
that
makes
movements
when
it
hears
a
shout
it
a
fine
thing
i
ca
understand
why
it
upsets
you
said
paul
no
perhaps
you
ca
but
i
understand
and
she
sat
back
in
her
chair
her
chin
in
one
hand
holding
her
elbow
with
the
other
brimmed
up
with
wrath
and
chagrin
and
shall
you
go
to
derby
asked
paul
it
no
i
see
for
and
why
on
earth
do
you
let
him
stop
it
just
what
he
of
course
cried
the
mother
you
know
what
he
wants
she
got
ready
and
went
by
the
first
train
to
derby
where
she
saw
her
son
and
the
sergeant
it
was
however
no
good
when
morel
was
having
his
dinner
in
the
evening
she
said
suddenly
i
had
to
go
to
derby
the
miner
turned
up
his
eyes
showing
the
whites
in
his
black
face
has
ter
lass
what
took
thee
there
that
arthur
oh
an
what
agate
now
he
only
morel
put
down
his
knife
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
nay
he
said
that
he
niver
and
is
going
down
to
aldershot
well
exclaimed
the
miner
that
a
he
considered
it
a
moment
said
h
and
proceeded
with
his
dinner
suddenly
his
face
contracted
with
wrath
i
hope
he
may
never
set
foot
i
my
house
again
he
said
the
idea
cried
morel
saying
such
a
thing
i
do
repeated
morel
a
fool
as
runs
away
for
a
soldier
let
look
after
i
s
do
no
more
for
a
fat
sight
you
have
done
as
it
is
she
said
and
morel
was
almost
ashamed
to
go
to
his
that
evening
well
did
you
go
said
paul
to
his
mother
when
he
came
home
i
and
could
you
see
him
and
what
did
he
say
he
blubbered
when
i
came
h
and
so
did
i
so
you
need
morel
fretted
after
her
son
she
knew
he
would
not
like
the
army
he
did
not
the
discipline
was
intolerable
to
him
but
the
doctor
she
said
with
some
pride
to
paul
said
he
was
perfectly
proportioned
almost
exactly
all
his
measurements
were
correct
he
is
you
he
awfully
but
he
does
fetch
the
girls
like
william
does
he
no
it
a
different
character
he
a
good
deal
like
his
father
to
console
his
mother
paul
did
not
go
much
to
willey
farm
at
this
time
and
in
the
autumn
exhibition
of
students
work
in
the
castle
he
had
two
studies
a
landscape
in
and
a
still
life
in
oil
both
of
which
had
awards
he
was
highly
excited
what
do
you
think
i
got
for
my
pictures
mother
he
asked
coming
home
one
evening
she
saw
by
his
eyes
he
was
glad
her
face
flushed
now
how
should
i
know
my
boy
a
first
prize
for
those
glass
jars
h
and
a
first
prize
for
that
sketch
up
at
willey
both
first
h
there
was
a
rosy
bright
look
about
her
though
she
said
nothing
it
nice
he
said
is
it
it
why
do
you
praise
me
up
to
the
skies
she
laughed
i
should
have
the
trouble
of
dragging
you
down
again
she
said
but
she
was
full
of
joy
nevertheless
william
had
brought
her
his
sporting
trophies
she
kept
them
still
and
she
did
not
forgive
his
death
arthur
was
handsome
at
least
a
good
specimen
and
warm
and
generous
and
probably
would
do
well
in
the
end
but
paul
was
going
to
distinguish
himself
she
had
a
great
belief
in
him
the
more
because
he
was
unaware
of
his
own
powers
there
was
so
much
to
come
out
of
him
life
for
her
was
rich
with
promise
she
was
to
see
herself
fulfilled
not
for
nothing
had
been
her
struggle
several
times
during
the
exhibition
morel
went
to
the
castle
unknown
to
paul
she
wandered
down
the
long
room
looking
at
the
other
exhibits
yes
they
were
good
but
they
had
not
in
them
a
certain
something
which
she
demanded
for
her
satisfaction
some
made
her
jealous
they
were
so
good
she
looked
at
them
a
long
time
trying
to
find
fault
with
them
then
suddenly
she
had
a
shock
that
made
her
heart
beat
there
hung
paul
picture
she
knew
it
as
if
it
were
printed
on
her
heart
name
paul
morel
first
it
looked
so
strange
there
in
public
on
the
walls
of
the
castle
gallery
where
in
her
lifetime
she
had
seen
so
many
pictures
and
she
glanced
round
to
see
if
anyone
had
noticed
her
again
in
front
of
the
same
sketch
but
she
felt
a
proud
woman
when
she
met
ladies
going
home
to
the
park
she
thought
to
herself
yes
you
look
very
well
but
i
wonder
if
your
son
has
two
first
prizes
in
the
and
she
walked
on
as
proud
a
little
woman
as
any
in
nottingham
and
paul
felt
he
had
done
something
for
her
if
only
a
trifle
all
his
work
was
hers
one
day
as
he
was
going
up
castle
gate
he
met
miriam
he
had
seen
her
on
the
sunday
and
had
not
expected
to
meet
her
in
town
she
was
walking
with
a
rather
striking
woman
blonde
with
a
sullen
expression
and
a
defiant
carriage
it
was
strange
how
miriam
in
her
bowed
meditative
bearing
looked
dwarfed
beside
this
woman
with
the
handsome
shoulders
miriam
watched
paul
searchingly
his
gaze
was
on
the
stranger
who
ignored
him
the
girl
saw
his
masculine
spirit
rear
its
head
hello
he
said
you
did
tell
me
you
were
coming
to
no
replied
miriam
half
apologetically
i
drove
in
to
cattle
market
with
he
looked
at
her
companion
i
told
you
about
dawes
said
miriam
huskily
she
was
nervous
clara
do
you
know
paul
i
think
i
seen
him
before
replied
dawes
indifferently
as
she
shook
hands
with
him
she
had
scornful
grey
eyes
a
skin
like
white
honey
and
a
full
mouth
with
a
slightly
lifted
upper
lip
that
did
not
know
whether
it
was
raised
in
scorn
of
all
men
or
out
of
eagerness
to
be
kissed
but
which
believed
the
former
she
carried
her
head
back
as
if
she
had
drawn
away
in
contempt
perhaps
from
men
also
she
wore
a
large
dowdy
hat
of
black
beaver
and
a
sort
of
slightly
affected
simple
dress
that
made
her
look
rather
she
was
evidently
poor
and
had
not
much
taste
miriam
usually
looked
nice
where
have
you
seen
me
paul
asked
of
the
woman
she
looked
at
him
as
if
she
would
not
trouble
to
answer
then
walking
with
louie
travers
she
said
louie
was
one
of
the
spiral
girls
why
do
you
know
her
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
he
turned
to
miriam
where
are
you
going
he
asked
to
the
what
train
are
you
going
home
by
i
am
driving
with
father
i
wish
you
could
come
too
what
time
are
you
free
you
know
not
till
eight
damn
it
and
directly
the
two
women
moved
on
paul
remembered
that
clara
dawes
was
the
daughter
of
an
old
friend
of
leivers
miriam
had
sought
her
out
because
she
had
once
been
spiral
overseer
at
jordan
and
because
her
husband
baxter
dawes
was
smith
for
the
factory
making
the
irons
for
cripple
instruments
and
so
on
through
her
miriam
felt
she
got
into
direct
contact
with
jordan
and
could
estimate
better
paul
position
but
dawes
was
separated
from
her
husband
and
had
taken
up
women
rights
she
was
supposed
to
be
clever
it
interested
paul
baxter
dawes
he
knew
and
disliked
the
smith
was
a
man
of
or
he
came
occasionally
through
paul
corner
a
big
man
also
striking
to
look
at
and
handsome
there
was
a
peculiar
similarity
between
himself
and
his
wife
he
had
the
same
white
skin
with
a
clear
golden
tinge
his
hair
was
of
soft
brown
his
moustache
was
golden
and
he
had
a
similar
defiance
in
his
bearing
and
manner
but
then
came
the
difference
his
eyes
dark
brown
and
were
dissolute
they
protruded
very
slightly
and
his
eyelids
hung
over
them
in
a
way
that
was
half
hate
his
mouth
too
was
sensual
his
whole
manner
was
of
cowed
defiance
as
if
he
were
ready
to
knock
anybody
down
who
disapproved
of
him
perhaps
because
he
really
disapproved
of
himself
from
the
first
day
he
had
hated
paul
finding
the
lad
impersonal
deliberate
gaze
of
an
artist
on
his
face
he
got
into
a
fury
what
are
yer
lookin
at
he
sneered
bullying
the
boy
glanced
away
but
the
smith
used
to
stand
behind
the
counter
and
talk
to
pappleworth
his
speech
was
dirty
with
a
kind
of
rottenness
again
he
found
the
youth
with
his
cool
critical
gaze
fixed
on
his
face
the
smith
started
round
as
if
he
had
been
stung
yer
lookin
at
three
o
pap
he
snarled
the
boy
shrugged
his
shoulders
slightly
why
yer
shouted
dawes
leave
him
alone
said
pappleworth
in
that
insinuating
voice
which
means
he
only
one
of
your
good
little
sops
who
ca
help
since
that
time
the
boy
used
to
look
at
the
man
every
time
he
came
through
with
the
same
curious
criticism
glancing
away
before
he
met
the
smith
eye
it
made
dawes
furious
they
hated
each
other
in
silence
clara
dawes
had
no
children
when
she
had
left
her
husband
the
home
had
been
broken
up
and
she
had
gone
to
live
with
her
mother
dawes
lodged
with
his
sister
in
the
same
house
was
a
and
somehow
paul
knew
that
this
girl
louie
travers
was
now
dawes
woman
she
was
a
handsome
insolent
hussy
who
mocked
at
the
youth
and
yet
flushed
if
he
walked
along
to
the
station
with
her
as
she
went
home
the
next
time
he
went
to
see
miriam
it
was
saturday
evening
she
had
a
fire
in
the
parlour
and
was
waiting
for
him
the
others
except
her
father
and
mother
and
the
young
children
had
gone
out
so
the
two
had
the
parlour
together
it
was
a
long
low
warm
room
there
were
three
of
paul
small
sketches
on
the
wall
and
his
photo
was
on
the
mantelpiece
on
the
table
and
on
the
high
old
rosewood
piano
were
bowls
of
coloured
leaves
he
sat
in
the
armchair
she
crouched
on
the
hearthrug
near
his
feet
the
glow
was
warm
on
her
handsome
pensive
face
as
she
kneeled
there
like
a
devotee
what
did
you
think
of
dawes
she
asked
quietly
she
does
look
very
amiable
he
replied
no
but
do
you
think
she
a
fine
woman
she
said
in
a
deep
tone
yes
in
stature
but
without
a
grain
of
taste
i
like
her
for
some
things
is
she
disagreeable
i
do
think
so
i
think
she
what
with
well
how
would
you
like
to
be
tied
for
life
to
a
man
like
that
why
did
she
marry
him
then
if
she
was
to
have
revulsions
so
soon
ay
why
did
she
repeated
miriam
bitterly
and
i
should
have
thought
she
had
enough
fight
in
her
to
match
him
he
said
miriam
bowed
her
head
ay
she
queried
satirically
what
makes
you
think
so
look
at
her
mouth
made
for
passion
and
the
very
setback
of
her
throat
he
threw
his
head
back
in
clara
defiant
manner
miriam
bowed
a
little
lower
yes
she
said
there
was
a
silence
for
some
moments
while
he
thought
of
clara
and
what
were
the
things
you
liked
about
her
she
asked
i
do
know
her
skin
and
the
texture
of
her
and
her
i
know
there
a
sort
of
fierceness
somewhere
in
her
i
appreciate
her
as
an
artist
that
he
wondered
why
miriam
crouched
there
brooding
in
that
strange
way
it
irritated
him
you
do
really
like
her
do
you
he
asked
the
girl
she
looked
at
him
with
her
great
dazzled
dark
eyes
i
do
she
said
you
do
you
ca
not
then
what
she
asked
slowly
eh
i
do
know
perhaps
you
like
her
because
she
got
a
grudge
against
that
was
more
probably
one
of
his
own
reasons
for
liking
dawes
but
this
did
not
occur
to
him
they
were
silent
there
had
come
into
his
forehead
a
knitting
of
the
brows
which
was
becoming
habitual
with
him
particularly
when
he
was
with
miriam
she
longed
to
smooth
it
away
and
she
was
afraid
of
it
it
seemed
the
stamp
of
a
man
who
was
not
her
man
in
paul
morel
there
were
some
crimson
berries
among
the
leaves
in
the
bowl
he
reached
over
and
pulled
out
a
bunch
if
you
put
red
berries
in
your
hair
he
said
why
would
you
look
like
some
witch
or
priestess
and
never
like
a
reveller
she
laughed
with
a
naked
painful
sound
i
do
know
she
said
his
vigorous
warm
hands
were
playing
excitedly
with
the
berries
why
ca
you
laugh
he
said
you
never
laugh
laughter
you
only
laugh
when
something
is
odd
or
incongruous
and
then
it
almost
seems
to
hurt
she
bowed
her
head
as
if
he
were
scolding
her
i
wish
you
could
laugh
at
me
just
for
one
minute
just
for
one
minute
i
feel
as
if
it
would
set
something
but
and
she
looked
up
at
him
with
eyes
frightened
and
struggling
i
do
laugh
at
you
i
never
there
always
a
kind
of
intensity
when
you
laugh
i
could
always
cry
it
seems
as
if
it
shows
up
your
suffering
oh
you
make
me
knit
the
brows
of
my
very
soul
and
slowly
she
shook
her
head
despairingly
i
sure
i
do
want
to
she
said
i
so
damned
spiritual
with
you
always
he
cried
she
remained
silent
thinking
then
why
do
you
be
but
he
saw
her
crouching
brooding
figure
and
it
seemed
to
tear
him
in
two
but
there
it
autumn
he
said
and
everybody
feels
like
a
disembodied
spirit
there
was
still
another
silence
this
peculiar
sadness
between
them
thrilled
her
soul
he
seemed
so
beautiful
with
his
eyes
gone
dark
and
looking
as
if
they
were
deep
as
the
deepest
well
you
make
me
so
spiritual
he
lamented
and
i
do
want
to
be
she
took
her
finger
from
her
mouth
with
a
little
pop
and
looked
up
at
him
almost
challenging
but
still
her
soul
was
naked
in
her
great
dark
eyes
and
there
was
the
same
yearning
appeal
upon
her
if
he
could
have
kissed
her
in
abstract
purity
he
would
have
done
so
but
he
could
not
kiss
her
thus
and
she
seemed
to
leave
no
other
way
and
she
yearned
to
him
he
gave
a
brief
laugh
well
he
said
get
that
french
and
we
do
some
some
yes
she
said
in
a
deep
tone
almost
of
resignation
and
she
rose
and
got
the
books
and
her
rather
red
nervous
hands
looked
so
pitiful
he
was
mad
to
comfort
her
and
kiss
her
but
then
be
dared
not
or
could
not
there
was
something
prevented
him
his
kisses
were
wrong
for
her
they
continued
the
reading
till
ten
when
they
went
into
the
kitchen
and
paul
was
natural
and
jolly
again
with
the
father
and
mother
his
eyes
were
dark
and
shining
there
was
a
kind
of
fascination
about
him
when
he
went
into
the
barn
for
his
bicycle
he
found
the
front
wheel
punctured
fetch
me
a
drop
of
water
in
a
bowl
he
said
to
her
i
shall
be
late
and
then
i
s
catch
he
lighted
the
hurricane
lamp
took
off
his
coat
turned
up
the
bicycle
and
set
speedily
to
work
miriam
came
with
the
bowl
of
water
and
stood
close
to
him
watching
she
loved
to
see
his
hands
doing
things
he
was
slim
and
vigorous
with
a
kind
of
easiness
even
in
his
most
hasty
movements
and
busy
at
his
work
he
seemed
to
forget
her
she
loved
him
absorbedly
she
wanted
to
run
her
hands
down
his
sides
she
always
wanted
to
embrace
him
so
long
as
he
did
not
want
her
there
he
said
rising
suddenly
now
could
you
have
done
it
quicker
no
she
laughed
he
straightened
himself
his
back
was
towards
her
she
put
her
two
hands
on
his
sides
and
ran
them
quickly
down
you
are
so
fine
she
said
he
laughed
hating
her
voice
but
his
blood
roused
to
a
wave
of
flame
by
her
hands
she
did
not
seem
to
realise
him
in
all
this
he
might
have
been
an
object
she
never
realised
the
male
he
was
he
lighted
his
bounced
the
machine
on
the
barn
floor
to
see
that
the
tyres
were
sound
and
buttoned
his
coat
that
all
right
he
said
she
was
trying
the
brakes
that
she
knew
were
broken
did
you
have
them
mended
she
asked
no
but
why
did
you
the
back
one
goes
on
a
but
it
not
i
can
use
my
i
wish
you
had
them
mended
she
murmured
do
worry
come
to
tea
tomorrow
with
shall
we
do
about
four
i
come
to
meet
very
she
was
pleased
they
went
across
the
dark
yard
to
the
gate
looking
across
he
saw
through
the
uncurtained
window
of
the
kitchen
the
heads
of
and
leivers
in
the
warm
glow
it
looked
very
cosy
the
road
with
pine
trees
was
quite
black
in
front
till
tomorrow
he
said
jumping
on
his
bicycle
you
take
care
wo
you
she
pleaded
his
voice
already
came
out
of
the
darkness
she
stood
a
moment
watching
the
light
from
his
lamp
race
into
obscurity
along
the
ground
she
turned
very
slowly
indoors
orion
was
wheeling
up
over
the
wood
his
dog
twinkling
after
him
half
smothered
for
the
rest
the
world
was
full
of
darkness
and
silent
save
for
the
breathing
of
cattle
in
their
stalls
she
prayed
earnestly
for
his
safety
that
night
when
he
left
her
she
often
lay
in
anxiety
wondering
if
he
had
got
home
safely
he
dropped
down
the
hills
on
his
bicycle
the
roads
were
greasy
so
he
had
to
let
it
go
he
felt
a
pleasure
as
the
machine
plunged
over
the
second
steeper
drop
in
the
hill
here
goes
he
said
it
was
risky
because
of
the
curve
in
the
darkness
at
the
bottom
and
because
of
the
brewers
waggons
with
drunken
waggoners
asleep
his
bicycle
seemed
to
fall
beneath
him
and
he
loved
it
recklessness
is
almost
a
revenge
on
his
woman
he
feels
he
is
not
valued
so
he
will
risk
destroying
himself
to
deprive
her
altogether
the
stars
on
the
lake
seemed
to
leap
like
grasshoppers
silver
upon
the
blackness
as
he
spun
past
then
there
was
the
long
climb
home
see
mother
he
said
as
he
threw
her
the
berries
and
leaves
on
to
the
table
h
she
said
glancing
at
them
then
away
again
she
sat
reading
alone
as
she
always
did
are
they
pretty
he
knew
she
was
cross
with
him
after
a
few
minutes
he
said
edgar
and
miriam
are
coming
to
tea
she
did
not
answer
you
do
mind
still
she
did
not
answer
do
you
he
asked
you
know
whether
i
mind
or
i
do
see
why
you
should
i
have
plenty
of
meals
you
then
why
do
you
begrudge
them
tea
i
begrudge
whom
tea
what
are
you
so
horrid
for
oh
say
no
more
you
asked
her
to
tea
it
quite
sufficient
he
was
very
angry
with
his
mother
he
knew
it
was
merely
miriam
she
objected
to
he
flung
off
his
boots
and
went
to
bed
paul
went
to
meet
his
friends
the
next
afternoon
he
was
glad
to
see
them
coming
they
arrived
home
at
about
four
everywhere
was
clean
and
still
for
sunday
afternoon
morel
sat
in
her
black
dress
and
black
apron
she
rose
to
meet
the
visitors
with
edgar
she
was
cordial
but
with
miriam
cold
and
rather
grudging
yet
paul
thought
the
girl
looked
so
nice
in
her
brown
cashmere
frock
he
helped
his
mother
to
get
the
tea
ready
miriam
would
have
gladly
proffered
but
was
afraid
he
was
rather
proud
of
his
home
there
was
about
it
now
he
thought
a
certain
distinction
the
chairs
were
only
wooden
and
the
sofa
was
old
but
the
hearthrug
and
cushions
were
cosy
the
pictures
were
prints
in
good
taste
there
was
a
simplicity
in
everything
and
plenty
of
books
he
was
never
ashamed
in
the
least
of
his
home
nor
was
miriam
of
hers
because
both
were
what
they
should
be
and
warm
and
then
he
was
proud
of
the
table
the
china
was
pretty
the
cloth
was
fine
it
did
not
matter
that
the
spoons
were
not
silver
nor
the
knives
everything
looked
nice
morel
had
managed
wonderfully
while
her
children
were
growing
up
so
that
nothing
was
out
of
place
miriam
talked
books
a
little
that
was
her
unfailing
topic
but
morel
was
not
cordial
and
turned
soon
to
edgar
at
first
edgar
and
miriam
used
to
go
into
morel
pew
morel
never
went
to
chapel
preferring
the
morel
like
a
little
champion
sat
at
the
head
of
her
pew
paul
at
the
other
end
and
at
first
miriam
sat
next
to
him
then
the
chapel
was
like
home
it
was
a
pretty
place
with
dark
pews
and
slim
elegant
pillars
and
flowers
and
the
same
people
had
sat
in
the
same
places
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
it
was
wonderfully
sweet
and
soothing
to
sit
there
for
an
hour
and
a
half
next
to
miriam
and
near
to
his
mother
uniting
his
two
loves
under
the
spell
of
the
place
of
worship
then
he
felt
warm
and
happy
and
religious
at
once
and
after
chapel
he
walked
home
with
miriam
whilst
morel
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
with
her
old
friend
burns
he
was
keenly
alive
on
his
walks
on
sunday
nights
with
edgar
and
miriam
he
never
went
past
the
pits
at
night
by
the
lighted
the
tall
black
headstocks
and
lines
of
trucks
past
the
fans
spinning
slowly
like
shadows
without
the
feeling
of
miriam
returning
to
him
keen
and
almost
unbearable
she
did
not
very
long
occupy
the
morels
pew
her
father
took
one
for
themselves
once
more
it
was
under
the
little
gallery
opposite
the
morels
when
paul
and
his
mother
came
in
the
chapel
the
leivers
pew
was
always
empty
he
was
anxious
for
fear
she
would
not
come
it
was
so
far
and
there
were
so
many
rainy
sundays
then
often
very
late
indeed
she
came
in
with
her
long
stride
her
head
bowed
her
face
hidden
under
her
hat
of
dark
green
velvet
her
face
as
she
sat
opposite
was
always
in
shadow
but
it
gave
him
a
very
keen
feeling
as
if
all
his
soul
stirred
within
him
to
see
her
there
it
was
not
the
same
glow
happiness
and
pride
that
he
felt
in
having
his
mother
in
charge
something
more
wonderful
less
human
and
tinged
to
intensity
by
a
pain
as
if
there
were
something
he
could
not
get
to
at
this
time
he
was
beginning
to
question
the
orthodox
creed
he
was
and
she
was
twenty
she
was
beginning
to
dread
the
spring
he
became
so
wild
and
hurt
her
so
much
all
the
way
he
went
cruelly
smashing
her
beliefs
edgar
enjoyed
it
he
was
by
nature
critical
and
rather
dispassionate
but
miriam
suffered
exquisite
pain
as
with
an
intellect
like
a
knife
the
man
she
loved
examined
her
religion
in
which
she
lived
and
moved
and
had
her
being
but
he
did
not
spare
her
he
was
cruel
and
when
they
went
alone
he
was
even
more
fierce
as
if
he
would
kill
her
soul
he
bled
her
beliefs
till
she
almost
lost
consciousness
she
exults
she
exults
as
she
carries
him
off
from
me
morel
cried
in
her
heart
when
paul
had
gone
she
not
like
an
ordinary
woman
who
can
leave
me
my
share
in
him
she
wants
to
absorb
him
she
wants
to
draw
him
out
and
absorb
him
till
there
is
nothing
left
of
him
even
for
himself
he
will
never
be
a
man
on
his
own
feet
she
will
suck
him
so
the
mother
sat
and
battled
and
brooded
bitterly
and
he
coming
home
from
his
walks
with
miriam
was
wild
with
torture
he
walked
biting
his
lips
and
with
clenched
fists
going
at
a
great
rate
then
brought
up
against
a
stile
he
stood
for
some
minutes
and
did
not
move
there
was
a
great
hollow
of
darkness
fronting
him
and
on
the
black
upslopes
patches
of
tiny
lights
and
in
the
lowest
trough
of
the
night
a
flare
of
the
pit
it
was
all
weird
and
dreadful
why
was
he
torn
so
almost
bewildered
and
unable
to
move
why
did
his
mother
sit
at
home
and
suffer
he
knew
she
suffered
badly
but
why
should
she
and
why
did
he
hate
miriam
and
feel
so
cruel
towards
her
at
the
thought
of
his
mother
if
miriam
caused
his
mother
suffering
then
he
hated
her
and
he
easily
hated
her
why
did
she
make
him
feel
as
if
he
were
uncertain
of
himself
insecure
an
indefinite
thing
as
if
he
had
not
sufficient
sheathing
to
prevent
the
night
and
the
space
breaking
into
him
how
he
hated
her
and
then
what
a
rush
of
tenderness
and
humility
suddenly
he
plunged
on
again
running
home
his
mother
saw
on
him
the
marks
of
some
agony
and
she
said
nothing
but
he
had
to
make
her
talk
to
him
then
she
was
angry
with
him
for
going
so
far
with
miriam
why
do
you
like
her
mother
he
cried
in
despair
i
do
know
my
boy
she
replied
piteously
i
sure
i
tried
to
like
her
i
tried
and
tried
but
i
ca
i
ca
and
he
felt
dreary
and
hopeless
between
the
two
spring
was
the
worst
time
he
was
changeable
and
intense
and
cruel
so
he
decided
to
stay
away
from
her
then
came
the
hours
when
he
knew
miriam
was
expecting
him
his
mother
watched
him
growing
restless
he
could
not
go
on
with
his
work
he
could
do
nothing
it
was
as
if
something
were
drawing
his
soul
out
towards
willey
farm
then
he
put
on
his
hat
and
went
saying
nothing
and
his
mother
knew
he
was
gone
and
as
soon
as
he
was
on
the
way
he
sighed
with
relief
and
when
he
was
with
her
he
was
cruel
again
one
day
in
march
he
lay
on
the
bank
of
nethermere
with
miriam
sitting
beside
him
it
was
a
glistening
day
big
clouds
so
brilliant
went
by
overhead
while
shadows
stole
along
on
the
water
the
clear
spaces
in
the
sky
were
of
clean
cold
blue
paul
lay
on
his
back
in
the
old
grass
looking
up
he
could
not
bear
to
look
at
miriam
she
seemed
to
want
him
and
he
resisted
he
resisted
all
the
time
he
wanted
now
to
give
her
passion
and
tenderness
and
he
could
not
he
felt
that
she
wanted
the
soul
out
of
his
body
and
not
him
all
his
strength
and
energy
she
drew
into
herself
through
some
channel
which
united
them
she
did
not
want
to
meet
him
so
that
there
were
two
of
them
man
and
woman
together
she
wanted
to
draw
all
of
him
into
her
it
urged
him
to
an
intensity
like
madness
which
fascinated
him
as
might
he
was
discussing
michael
angelo
it
felt
to
her
as
if
she
were
fingering
the
very
quivering
tissue
the
very
protoplasm
of
life
as
she
heard
him
it
gave
her
deepest
satisfaction
and
in
the
end
it
frightened
her
there
he
lay
in
the
white
intensity
of
his
search
and
his
voice
gradually
filled
her
with
fear
so
level
it
was
almost
inhuman
as
if
in
a
trance
do
talk
any
more
she
pleaded
softly
laying
her
hand
on
his
forehead
he
lay
quite
still
almost
unable
to
move
his
body
was
somewhere
discarded
why
not
are
you
tired
yes
and
it
wears
you
he
laughed
shortly
realising
yet
you
always
make
me
like
it
he
said
i
do
wish
to
she
said
very
low
not
when
you
gone
too
far
and
you
feel
you
ca
bear
it
but
your
unconscious
self
always
asks
it
of
me
and
i
suppose
i
want
he
went
on
in
his
dead
fashion
if
only
you
could
want
me
and
not
want
what
i
can
reel
off
for
you
i
she
cried
bitterly
i
why
when
would
you
let
me
take
you
then
it
my
fault
he
said
and
gathering
himself
together
he
got
up
and
began
to
talk
trivialities
he
felt
insubstantial
in
a
vague
way
he
hated
her
for
it
and
he
knew
he
was
as
much
to
blame
himself
this
however
did
not
prevent
his
hating
her
one
evening
about
this
time
he
had
walked
along
the
home
road
with
her
they
stood
by
the
pasture
leading
down
to
the
wood
unable
to
part
as
the
stars
came
out
the
clouds
closed
they
had
glimpses
of
their
own
constellation
orion
towards
the
west
his
jewels
glimmered
for
a
moment
his
dog
ran
low
struggling
with
difficulty
through
the
spume
of
cloud
orion
was
for
them
chief
in
significance
among
the
constellations
they
had
gazed
at
him
in
their
strange
surcharged
hours
of
feeling
until
they
seemed
themselves
to
live
in
every
one
of
his
stars
this
evening
paul
had
been
moody
and
perverse
orion
had
seemed
just
an
ordinary
constellation
to
him
he
had
fought
against
his
glamour
and
fascination
miriam
was
watching
her
lover
mood
carefully
but
he
said
nothing
that
gave
him
away
till
the
moment
came
to
part
when
he
stood
frowning
gloomily
at
the
gathered
clouds
behind
which
the
great
constellation
must
be
striding
still
there
was
to
be
a
little
party
at
his
house
the
next
day
at
which
she
was
to
attend
i
sha
come
and
meet
you
he
said
oh
very
well
it
not
very
nice
out
she
replied
slowly
it
not
that
only
they
do
like
me
to
they
say
i
care
more
for
you
than
for
them
and
you
understand
do
you
you
know
it
only
miriam
was
astonished
and
hurt
for
him
it
had
cost
him
an
effort
she
left
him
wanting
to
spare
him
any
further
humiliation
a
fine
rain
blew
in
her
face
as
she
walked
along
the
road
she
was
hurt
deep
down
and
she
despised
him
for
being
blown
about
by
any
wind
of
authority
and
in
her
heart
of
hearts
unconsciously
she
felt
that
he
was
trying
to
get
away
from
her
this
she
would
never
have
acknowledged
she
pitied
him
at
this
time
paul
became
an
important
factor
in
jordan
warehouse
pappleworth
left
to
set
up
a
business
of
his
own
and
paul
remained
with
jordan
as
spiral
overseer
his
wages
were
to
be
raised
to
thirty
shillings
at
the
if
things
went
well
still
on
friday
night
miriam
often
came
down
for
her
french
lesson
paul
did
not
go
so
frequently
to
willey
farm
and
she
grieved
at
the
thought
of
her
education
coming
to
end
moreover
they
both
loved
to
be
together
in
spite
of
discords
so
they
read
balzac
and
did
compositions
and
felt
highly
cultured
friday
night
was
reckoning
night
for
the
miners
morel
reckoned
shared
up
the
money
of
the
stall
either
in
the
new
inn
at
bretty
or
in
his
own
house
according
as
his
wished
barker
had
turned
a
so
now
the
men
reckoned
at
house
annie
who
had
been
teaching
away
was
at
home
again
she
was
still
a
tomboy
and
she
was
engaged
to
be
married
paul
was
studying
design
morel
was
always
in
good
spirits
on
friday
evening
unless
the
earnings
were
small
he
bustled
immediately
after
his
dinner
prepared
to
get
washed
it
was
decorum
for
the
women
to
absent
themselves
while
the
men
reckoned
women
were
not
supposed
to
spy
into
such
a
masculine
privacy
as
the
butties
reckoning
nor
were
they
to
know
the
exact
amount
of
the
week
earnings
so
whilst
her
father
was
spluttering
in
the
scullery
annie
went
out
to
spend
an
hour
with
a
neighbour
morel
attended
to
her
baking
shut
that
bawled
morel
furiously
annie
banged
it
behind
her
and
was
gone
if
tha
oppens
it
again
while
i
weshin
me
i
thy
jaw
rattle
he
threatened
from
the
midst
of
his
paul
and
the
mother
frowned
to
hear
him
presently
he
came
running
out
of
the
scullery
with
the
soapy
water
dripping
from
him
dithering
with
cold
oh
my
sirs
he
said
wheer
my
towel
it
was
hung
on
a
chair
to
warm
before
the
fire
otherwise
he
would
have
bullied
and
blustered
he
squatted
on
his
heels
before
the
hot
to
dry
himself
he
went
pretending
to
shudder
with
cold
goodness
man
do
be
such
a
kid
said
morel
it
not
thee
strip
thysen
stark
nak
to
wesh
thy
flesh
i
that
scullery
said
the
miner
as
he
rubbed
his
hair
nowt
a
and
i
should
make
that
fuss
replied
his
wife
no
tha
drop
down
stiff
as
dead
as
a
wi
thy
nesh
why
is
a
deader
than
anything
else
asked
paul
curious
eh
i
dunno
that
what
they
say
replied
his
father
but
that
much
draught
i
yon
scullery
as
it
blows
through
your
ribs
like
through
a
it
would
have
some
difficulty
in
blowing
through
yours
said
morel
morel
looked
down
ruefully
at
his
sides
me
he
exclaimed
i
nowt
a
skinned
rabbit
my
bones
fair
juts
out
on
i
should
like
to
know
where
retorted
his
wife
i
nobbut
a
sack
o
morel
laughed
he
had
still
a
wonderfully
young
body
muscular
without
any
fat
his
skin
was
smooth
and
clear
it
might
have
been
the
body
of
a
man
of
except
that
there
were
perhaps
too
many
blue
scars
like
where
the
remained
under
the
skin
and
that
his
chest
was
too
hairy
but
he
put
his
hand
on
his
side
ruefully
it
was
his
fixed
belief
that
because
he
did
not
get
fat
he
was
as
thin
as
a
starved
rat
paul
looked
at
his
father
thick
brownish
hands
all
scarred
with
broken
nails
rubbing
the
fine
smoothness
of
his
sides
and
the
incongruity
struck
him
it
seemed
strange
they
were
the
same
flesh
i
suppose
he
said
to
his
father
you
had
a
good
figure
eh
exclaimed
the
miner
glancing
round
startled
and
timid
like
a
child
he
had
exclaimed
morel
if
he
did
hurtle
himself
up
as
if
he
was
trying
to
get
in
the
smallest
space
he
me
exclaimed
morel
me
a
good
figure
i
wor
niver
much
more
a
man
cried
his
wife

a
pulamiter
he
said
tha
niver
knowed
me
but
what
i
looked
as
if
i
wor
goin
off
in
a
rapid
she
sat
and
laughed
you
had
a
constitution
like
iron
she
said
and
never
a
man
had
a
better
start
if
it
was
body
that
counted
you
should
have
seen
him
as
a
young
man
she
cried
suddenly
to
paul
drawing
herself
up
to
imitate
her
husband
once
handsome
bearing
morel
watched
her
shyly
he
saw
again
the
passion
she
had
had
for
him
it
blazed
upon
her
for
a
moment
he
was
shy
rather
scared
and
humble
yet
again
he
felt
his
old
glow
and
then
immediately
he
felt
the
ruin
he
had
made
during
these
years
he
wanted
to
bustle
about
to
run
away
from
it
my
back
a
bit
of
a
wesh
he
asked
her
his
wife
brought
a
flannel
and
clapped
it
on
his
shoulders
he
gave
a
jump
eh
tha
mucky
little
he
cried
cowd
as
death
you
ought
to
have
been
a
salamander
she
laughed
washing
his
back
it
was
very
rarely
she
would
do
anything
so
personal
for
him
the
children
did
those
things
the
next
world
wo
be
half
hot
enough
for
you
she
added
no
he
said
see
as
it
draughty
for
but
she
had
finished
she
wiped
him
in
a
desultory
fashion
and
went
upstairs
returning
immediately
with
his
when
he
was
dried
he
struggled
into
his
shirt
then
ruddy
and
shiny
with
hair
on
end
and
his
flannelette
shirt
hanging
over
his
he
stood
warming
the
garments
he
was
going
to
put
on
he
turned
them
he
pulled
them
inside
out
he
scorched
them
goodness
man
cried
morel
get
dressed
should
thee
like
to
clap
thysen
into
britches
as
cowd
as
a
tub
water
he
said
at
last
he
took
off
his
and
donned
decent
black
he
did
all
this
on
the
hearthrug
as
he
would
have
done
if
annie
and
her
familiar
friends
had
been
present
morel
turned
the
bread
in
the
oven
then
from
the
red
earthenware
panchion
of
dough
that
stood
in
a
corner
she
took
another
handful
of
paste
worked
it
to
the
proper
shape
and
dropped
it
into
a
tin
as
she
was
doing
so
barker
knocked
and
entered
he
was
a
quiet
compact
little
man
who
looked
as
if
he
would
go
through
a
stone
wall
his
black
hair
was
cropped
short
his
head
was
bony
like
most
miners
he
was
pale
but
healthy
and
taut
evenin
missis
he
nodded
to
morel
and
he
seated
himself
with
a
sigh
she
replied
cordially
tha
made
thy
heels
crack
said
morel
i
dunno
as
i
have
said
barker
he
sat
as
the
men
always
did
in
morel
kitchen
effacing
himself
rather
how
missis
she
asked
of
him
he
had
told
her
some
time
back
we
expectin
us
third
just
now

he
answered
rubbing
his
head
she
keeps
pretty
middlin
i
let
see
when
asked
morel
well
i
should
be
surprised
any
time

she
kept
fairly
yes
that
a
blessing
for
she
none
too
no
an
i
done
another
silly
what
that
morel
knew
barker
would
do
anything
very
silly
i
come

you
can
have
nay
you
be
wantin
that
i
sha
i
take
a
string
bag
she
saw
the
determined
little
collier
buying
in
the
week
groceries
and
meat
on
the
friday
nights
and
she
admired
him
barker
little
but
he
ten
times
the
man
you
are
she
said
to
her
husband
just
then
wesson
entered
he
was
thin
rather
with
a
boyish
ingenuousness
and
a
slightly
foolish
smile
despite
his
seven
children
but
his
wife
was
a
passionate
woman
i
see
you
kested
me
he
said
smiling
rather
vapidly
yes
replied
barker
the
newcomer
took
off
his
cap
and
his
big
woollen
muffler
his
nose
was
pointed
and
red
i
afraid
you
cold
wesson
said
morel
it
a
bit
nippy
he
replied
then
come
to
the
nay
i
s
do
where
i
both
colliers
sat
away
back
they
could
not
be
induced
to
come
on
to
the
hearth
the
hearth
is
sacred
to
the
family
go
thy
ways
i
th
armchair
cried
morel
cheerily
nay
thank
yer
i
very
nicely
yes
come
of
course
insisted
morel
he
rose
and
went
awkwardly
he
sat
in
morel
armchair
awkwardly
it
was
too
great
a
familiarity
but
the
fire
made
him
blissfully
happy
and
how
that
chest
of
yours
demanded
morel
he
smiled
again
with
his
blue
eyes
rather
sunny
oh
it
very
middlin
he
said
wi
a
rattle
in
it
like
a
said
barker
shortly
went
morel
rapidly
with
her
tongue
did
you
have
that
flannel
singlet
made
not
yet
he
smiled
then
why
did
you
she
cried
it
come
he
smiled
ah
an
doomsday
exclaimed
barker
barker
and
morel
were
both
impatient
of
wesson
but
then
they
were
both
as
hard
as
nails
physically
when
morel
was
nearly
ready
he
pushed
the
bag
of
money
to
paul
count
it
boy
he
asked
humbly
paul
impatiently
turned
from
his
books
and
pencil
tipped
the
bag
upside
down
on
the
table
there
was
a
bag
of
silver
sovereigns
and
loose
money
he
counted
quickly
referred
to
the
checks
the
written
papers
giving
amount
of
coal
put
the
money
in
order
then
barker
glanced
at
the
checks
morel
went
upstairs
and
the
three
men
came
to
table
morel
as
master
of
the
house
sat
in
his
armchair
with
his
back
to
the
hot
fire
the
two
butties
had
cooler
seats
none
of
them
counted
the
money
what
did
we
say
simpson
was
asked
morel
and
the
butties
cavilled
for
a
minute
over
the
dayman
earnings
then
the
amount
was
put
aside
an
bill
naylor
this
money
also
was
taken
from
the
pack
then
because
wesson
lived
in
one
of
the
company
houses
and
his
rent
had
been
deducted
morel
and
barker
took
each
and
because
morel
coals
had
come
and
the
leading
was
stopped
barker
and
wesson
took
four
shillings
each
then
it
was
plain
sailing
morel
gave
each
of
them
a
sovereign
till
there
were
no
more
sovereigns
each
half
a
crown
till
there
were
no
more
each
a
shilling
till
there
were
no
more
shillings
if
there
was
anything
at
the
end
that
would
split
morel
took
it
and
stood
drinks
then
the
three
men
rose
and
went
morel
scuttled
out
of
the
house
before
his
wife
came
down
she
heard
the
door
close
and
descended
she
looked
hastily
at
the
bread
in
the
oven
then
glancing
on
the
table
she
saw
her
money
lying
paul
had
been
working
all
the
time
but
now
he
felt
his
mother
counting
the
week
money
and
her
wrath
rising
went
her
tongue
he
frowned
he
could
not
work
when
she
was
cross
she
counted
again
a
measly
shillings
she
exclaimed
how
much
was
the
cheque
ten
pounds
eleven
said
paul
irritably
he
dreaded
what
was
coming
and
he
gives
me
a
scrattlin
an
his
club
this
week
but
i
know
him
he
thinks
because
you
earning
he
need
keep
the
house
any
longer
no
all
he
has
to
do
with
his
money
is
to
guttle
it
but
show
him
oh
mother
do
cried
paul
do
what
i
should
like
to
know
she
exclaimed
do
carry
on
again
i
ca
she
went
very
quiet
yes
it
all
very
well
she
said
but
how
do
you
think
i
going
to
manage
well
it
wo
make
it
any
better
to
whittle
about
i
should
like
to
know
what
you
do
if
you
had
it
to
put
up
it
wo
be
long
you
can
have
my
money
let
him
go
to
he
went
back
to
his
work
and
she
tied
her
grimly
when
she
was
fretted
he
could
not
bear
it
but
now
he
began
to
insist
on
her
recognizing
him
the
two
loaves
at
the
top
she
said
will
be
done
in
twenty
minutes
do
forget
all
right
he
answered
and
she
went
to
market
he
remained
alone
working
but
his
usual
intense
concentration
became
unsettled
he
listened
for
the
at
a
seven
came
a
low
knock
and
miriam
entered
all
alone
she
said
as
if
at
home
she
took
off
her
and
her
long
coat
hanging
them
up
it
gave
him
a
thrill
this
might
be
their
own
house
his
and
hers
then
she
came
back
and
peered
over
his
work
what
is
it
she
asked
still
design
for
decorating
stuffs
and
for
she
bent
over
the
drawings
it
irritated
him
that
she
peered
so
into
everything
that
was
his
searching
him
out
he
went
into
the
parlour
and
returned
with
a
bundle
of
brownish
linen
carefully
unfolding
it
he
spread
it
on
the
floor
it
proved
to
be
a
curtain
or
portiere
beautifully
stencilled
with
a
design
on
roses
ah
how
beautiful
she
cried
the
spread
cloth
with
its
wonderful
reddish
roses
and
dark
green
stems
all
so
simple
and
somehow
so
lay
at
her
feet
she
went
on
her
knees
before
it
her
dark
curls
dropping
he
saw
her
crouched
voluptuously
before
his
work
and
his
heart
beat
quickly
suddenly
she
looked
up
at
him
why
does
it
seem
cruel
she
asked
what
there
seems
a
feeling
of
cruelty
about
it
she
said
it
jolly
good
whether
or
not
he
replied
folding
up
his
work
with
a
lover
hands
she
rose
slowly
pondering
and
what
will
you
do
with
it
she
asked
send
it
to
liberty
i
did
it
for
my
mother
but
i
think
she
rather
have
the
yes
said
miriam
he
had
spoken
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
and
miriam
sympathised
money
would
have
been
nothing
to
her
he
took
the
cloth
back
into
the
parlour
when
he
returned
he
threw
to
miriam
a
smaller
piece
it
was
a
with
the
same
design
i
did
that
for
you
he
said
she
fingered
the
work
with
trembling
hands
and
did
not
speak
he
became
embarrassed
by
jove
the
bread
he
cried
he
took
the
top
loaves
out
tapped
them
vigorously
they
were
done
he
put
them
on
the
hearth
to
cool
then
he
went
to
the
scullery
wetted
his
hands
scooped
the
last
white
dough
out
of
the
punchion
and
dropped
it
in
a
miriam
was
still
bent
over
her
painted
cloth
he
stood
rubbing
the
bits
of
dough
from
his
hands
you
do
like
it
he
asked
she
looked
up
at
him
with
her
dark
eyes
one
flame
of
love
he
laughed
uncomfortably
then
he
began
to
talk
about
the
design
there
was
for
him
the
most
intense
pleasure
in
talking
about
his
work
to
miriam
all
his
passion
all
his
wild
blood
went
into
this
intercourse
with
her
when
he
talked
and
conceived
his
work
she
brought
forth
to
him
his
imaginations
she
did
not
understand
any
more
than
a
woman
understands
when
she
conceives
a
child
in
her
womb
but
this
was
life
for
her
and
for
him
while
they
were
talking
a
young
woman
of
about
small
and
pale
yet
with
a
relentless
look
about
her
entered
the
room
she
was
a
friend
at
the
morel
take
your
things
off
said
paul
no
i
not
she
sat
down
in
the
armchair
opposite
paul
and
miriam
who
were
on
the
sofa
miriam
moved
a
little
farther
from
him
the
room
was
hot
with
a
scent
of
new
bread
brown
crisp
loaves
stood
on
the
hearth
i
should
have
expected
to
see
you
here
miriam
leivers
said
beatrice
wickedly
why
not
murmured
miriam
huskily
why
let
look
at
your
miriam
remained
uncomfortably
still
if
tha
doesna
tha
laughed
beatrice
miriam
put
her
feet
from
under
her
dress
her
boots
had
that
queer
irresolute
rather
pathetic
look
about
them
which
showed
how
and
she
was
and
they
were
covered
with
mud
glory
you
a
positive
exclaimed
beatrice
who
cleans
your
boots
i
clean
them
then
you
wanted
a
job
said
beatrice
it
would
ha
taken
a
lot
of
men
to
ha
brought
me
down
here
but
love
laughs
at
sludge
it
my
duck
inter
alia
he
said
oh
lord
are
you
going
to
spout
foreign
languages
what
does
it
mean
miriam
there
was
a
fine
sarcasm
in
the
last
question
but
miriam
did
not
see
it
other
things
i
believe
she
said
humbly
beatrice
put
her
tongue
between
her
teeth
and
laughed
wickedly
other
things
she
repeated
do
you
mean
love
laughs
at
mothers
and
fathers
and
sisters
and
brothers
and
men
friends
and
lady
friends
and
even
at
the
himself
she
affected
a
great
innocence
in
fact
it
one
big
smile
he
replied
up
its
sleeve
morel
you
believe
me
she
said
and
she
went
off
into
another
burst
of
wicked
silent
laughter
miriam
sat
silent
withdrawn
into
herself
every
one
of
friends
delighted
in
taking
sides
against
her
and
he
left
her
in
the
lurch
seemed
almost
to
have
a
sort
of
revenge
upon
her
then
are
you
still
at
school
asked
miriam
of
beatrice
you
not
had
your
notice
then
i
expect
it
at
is
it
an
awful
shame
to
turn
you
off
merely
because
you
did
pass
the
exam
i
do
know
said
beatrice
coldly
agatha
says
you
as
good
as
any
teacher
anywhere
it
seems
to
me
ridiculous
i
wonder
why
you
did
short
of
brains
eh
said
beatrice
briefly
only
brains
to
bite
with
replied
paul
laughing
nuisance
she
cried
and
springing
from
her
seat
she
rushed
and
boxed
his
ears
she
had
beautiful
small
hands
he
held
her
wrists
while
she
wrestled
with
him
at
last
she
broke
free
and
seized
two
handfuls
of
his
thick
dark
brown
hair
which
she
shook
beat
he
said
as
he
pulled
his
hair
straight
with
his
fingers
i
hate
you
she
laughed
with
glee
mind
she
said
i
want
to
sit
next
to
i
as
lief
be
neighbours
with
a
vixen
he
said
nevertheless
making
place
for
her
between
him
and
miriam
did
it
ruffle
his
pretty
hair
then
she
cried
and
with
her
she
combed
him
straight
and
his
nice
little
moustache
she
exclaimed
she
tilted
his
head
back
and
combed
his
young
moustache
it
a
wicked
moustache
she
said
it
a
red
for
danger
have
you
got
any
of
those
cigarettes
he
pulled
his
from
his
pocket
beatrice
looked
inside
it
and
fancy
me
having
connie
last
said
beatrice
putting
the
thing
between
her
teeth
he
held
a
lit
match
to
her
and
she
puffed
daintily
thanks
so
much
darling
she
said
mockingly
it
gave
her
a
wicked
delight
do
you
think
he
does
it
nicely
miriam
she
asked
oh
very
said
miriam
he
took
a
cigarette
for
himself
light
old
boy
said
beatrice
tilting
her
cigarette
at
him
he
bent
forward
to
her
to
light
his
cigarette
at
hers
she
was
winking
at
him
as
he
did
so
miriam
saw
his
eyes
trembling
with
mischief
and
his
full
almost
sensual
mouth
quivering
he
was
not
himself
and
she
could
not
bear
it
as
he
was
now
she
had
no
connection
with
him
she
might
as
well
not
have
existed
she
saw
the
cigarette
dancing
on
his
full
red
lips
she
hated
his
thick
hair
for
being
tumbled
loose
on
his
forehead
sweet
boy
said
beatrice
tipping
up
his
chin
and
giving
him
a
little
kiss
on
the
cheek
i
s
kiss
thee
back
beat
he
said
tha
wunna
she
giggled
jumping
up
and
going
away
is
he
shameless
miriam
quite
said
miriam
by
the
way
are
you
forgetting
the
bread
by
jove
he
cried
flinging
open
the
oven
door
out
puffed
the
bluish
smoke
and
a
smell
of
burned
bread
oh
golly
cried
beatrice
coming
to
his
side
he
crouched
before
the
oven
she
peered
over
his
shoulder
this
is
what
comes
of
the
oblivion
of
love
my
paul
was
ruefully
removing
the
loaves
one
was
burnt
black
on
the
hot
side
another
was
hard
as
a
brick
poor
mater
said
paul
you
want
to
grate
it
said
beatrice
fetch
me
the
she
arranged
the
bread
in
the
oven
he
brought
the
grater
and
she
grated
the
bread
on
to
a
newspaper
on
the
table
he
set
the
doors
open
to
blow
away
the
smell
of
burned
bread
beatrice
grated
away
puffing
her
cigarette
knocking
the
charcoal
off
the
poor
loaf
my
word
miriam
you
in
for
it
this
time
said
beatrice
i
exclaimed
miriam
in
amazement
you
better
be
gone
when
his
mother
comes
in
i
know
why
king
alfred
burned
the
cakes
now
i
see
it
would
fix
up
a
tale
about
his
work
making
him
forget
if
he
thought
it
would
wash
if
that
old
woman
had
come
in
a
bit
sooner
she
have
boxed
the
brazen
thing
ears
who
made
the
oblivion
instead
of
poor
she
giggled
as
she
scraped
the
loaf
even
miriam
laughed
in
spite
of
herself
paul
mended
the
fire
ruefully
the
garden
gate
was
heard
to
bang
quick
cried
beatrice
giving
paul
the
scraped
loaf
wrap
it
up
in
a
damp
paul
disappeared
into
the
scullery
beatrice
hastily
blew
her
scrapings
into
the
fire
and
sat
down
innocently
annie
came
bursting
in
she
was
an
abrupt
quite
smart
young
woman
she
blinked
in
the
strong
light
smell
of
burning
she
exclaimed
it
the
cigarettes
replied
beatrice
demurely
where
paul
leonard
had
followed
annie
he
had
a
long
comic
face
and
blue
eyes
very
sad
i
suppose
he
left
you
to
settle
it
between
you
he
said
he
nodded
sympathetically
to
miriam
and
became
gently
sarcastic
to
beatrice

beatrice
he
gone
off
with
number
i
just
met
number

inquiring
for

leonard

beatrice
i

said
leonard
twisting
up
a
comic
face
annie

looking
in
the
oven
miriam
sat
ignored
paul
entered
this
bread
a
fine
sight
our
paul
said
annie

look

paul

a
bit
of
a
change
like
insinuated
leonard
kindly
well
you
ca
be
stuck
in
the
house
for
ever
annie
agreed
she
was
quite
amiable
beatrice
pulled
on
her
coat
and
went
out
with
leonard
and
annie
she
would
meet
her
own
boy
do
forget
that
bread
our
paul
cried
annie
miriam
i
do
think
it
will
when
they
had
all
gone
paul
fetched
the
swathed
loaf
unwrapped
it
and
surveyed
it
sadly
it
a
mess
he
said
but
answered
miriam
impatiently
what
is
it
after
all
twopence
yes
but
it
the
mater
precious
baking
and
she
take
it
to
heart
however
it
no
good
he
took
the
loaf
back
into
the
scullery
there
was
a
little
distance
between
him
and
miriam
he
stood
balanced
opposite
her
for
some
moments
considering
thinking
of
his
behaviour
with
beatrice
he
felt
guilty
inside
himself
and
yet
glad
for
some
inscrutable
reason
it
served
miriam
right
he
was
not
going
to
repent
she
wondered
what
he
was
thinking
of
as
he
stood
suspended
his
thick
hair
was
tumbled
over
his
forehead
why
might
she
not
push
it
back
for
him
and
remove
the
marks
of
beatrice
comb
why
might
she
not
press
his
body
with
her
two
hands
it
looked
so
firm
and
every
whit
living
and
he
would
let
other
girls
why
not
her
suddenly
he
started
into
life
it
made
her
quiver
almost
with
terror
as
he
quickly
pushed
the
hair
off
his
forehead
and
came
towards
her
eight
he
said
we
better
buck
up
where
your
french
miriam
shyly
and
rather
bitterly
produced
her
every
week
she
wrote
for
him
a
sort
of
diary
of
her
inner
life
in
her
own
french
he
had
found
this
was
the
only
way
to
get
her
to
do
compositions
and
her
diary
was
mostly
a
he
would
read
it
now
she
felt
as
if
her
soul
history
were
going
to
be
desecrated
by
him
in
his
present
mood
he
sat
beside
her
she
watched
his
hand
firm
and
warm
rigorously
scoring
her
work
he
was
reading
only
the
french
ignoring
her
soul
that
was
there
but
gradually
his
hand
forgot
its
work
he
read
in
silence
motionless
she
quivered
matin
les
oiseaux
eveille
he
read
faisait
encore
un
crepuscule
mais
la
petite
fenetre
de
ma
chambre
etait
bleme
et
puis
jaune
et
tous
les
oiseaux
du
bois
eclaterent
dans
un
chanson
vif
et
resonnant
toute
tressaillit
reve
de
vous
que
vous
voyez
aussi
les
oiseaux
presque
tous
les
matins
et
toujours
il
y
a
quelque
chose
de
terreur
dans
le
cri
des
grives
il
est
si
miriam
sat
tremulous
half
ashamed
he
remained
quite
still
trying
to
understand
he
only
knew
she
loved
him
he
was
afraid
of
her
love
for
him
it
was
too
good
for
him
and
he
was
inadequate
his
own
love
was
at
fault
not
hers
ashamed
he
corrected
her
work
humbly
writing
above
her
words
look
he
said
quietly
the
past
participle
conjugated
with
agrees
with
the
direct
object
when
it
she
bent
forward
trying
to
see
and
to
understand
her
free
fine
curls
tickled
his
face
he
started
as
if
they
had
been
red
hot
shuddering
he
saw
her
peering
forward
at
the
page
her
red
lips
parted
piteously
the
black
hair
springing
in
fine
strands
across
her
tawny
ruddy
cheek
she
was
coloured
like
a
pomegranate
for
richness
his
breath
came
short
as
he
watched
her
suddenly
she
looked
up
at
him
her
dark
eyes
were
naked
with
their
love
afraid
and
yearning
his
eyes
too
were
dark
and
they
hurt
her
they
seemed
to
master
her
she
lost
all
her
was
exposed
in
fear
and
he
knew
before
he
could
kiss
her
he
must
drive
something
out
of
himself
and
a
touch
of
hate
for
her
crept
back
again
into
his
heart
he
returned
to
her
exercise
suddenly
he
flung
down
the
pencil
and
was
at
the
oven
in
a
leap
turning
the
bread
for
miriam
he
was
too
quick
she
started
violently
and
it
hurt
her
with
real
pain
even
the
way
he
crouched
before
the
oven
hurt
her
there
seemed
to
be
something
cruel
in
it
something
cruel
in
the
swift
way
he
pitched
the
bread
out
of
the
tins
caught
it
up
again
if
only
he
had
been
gentle
in
his
movements
she
would
have
felt
so
rich
and
warm
as
it
was
she
was
hurt
he
returned
and
finished
the
exercise
you
done
well
this
week
he
said
she
saw
he
was
flattered
by
her
diary
it
did
not
repay
her
entirely
you
really
do
blossom
out
sometimes
he
said
you
ought
to
write
she
lifted
her
head
with
joy
then
she
shook
it
mistrustfully
i
do
trust
myself
she
said
you
should
try
again
she
shook
her
head
shall
we
read
or
is
it
too
late
he
asked
it
is
late
but
we
can
read
just
a
little
she
pleaded
she
was
really
getting
now
the
food
for
her
life
during
the
next
week
he
made
her
copy
baudelaire
le
balcon
then
he
read
it
for
her
his
voice
was
soft
and
caressing
but
growing
almost
brutal
he
had
a
way
of
lifting
his
lips
and
showing
his
teeth
passionately
and
bitterly
when
he
was
much
moved
this
he
did
now
it
made
miriam
feel
as
if
he
were
trampling
on
her
she
dared
not
look
at
him
but
sat
with
her
head
bowed
she
could
not
understand
why
he
got
into
such
a
tumult
and
fury
it
made
her
wretched
she
did
not
like
baudelaire
on
the
whole
nor
verlaine
behold
her
singing
in
the
field
yon
solitary
highland
that
nourished
her
heart
so
did
fair
ines
and
it
was
a
beauteous
evening
calm
and
pure
and
breathing
holy
quiet
like
a
these
were
like
herself
and
there
was
he
saying
in
his
throat
bitterly
te
rappelleras
la
beaute
des
the
poem
was
finished
he
took
the
bread
out
of
the
oven
arranging
the
burnt
loaves
at
the
bottom
of
the
panchion
the
good
ones
at
the
top
the
desiccated
loaf
remained
swathed
up
in
the
scullery
mater
need
know
till
morning
he
said
it
wo
upset
her
so
much
then
as
at
miriam
looked
in
the
bookcase
saw
what
postcards
and
letters
he
had
received
saw
what
books
were
there
she
took
one
that
had
interested
him
then
he
turned
down
the
gas
and
they
set
off
he
did
not
trouble
to
lock
the
door
he
was
not
home
again
until
a
quarter
to
eleven
his
mother
was
seated
in
the
annie
with
a
rope
of
hair
hanging
down
her
back
remained
sitting
on
a
low
stool
before
the
fire
her
elbows
on
her
knees
gloomily
on
the
table
stood
the
offending
loaf
unswathed
paul
entered
rather
breathless
no
one
spoke
his
mother
was
reading
the
little
local
newspaper
he
took
off
his
coat
and
went
to
sit
down
on
the
sofa
his
mother
moved
curtly
aside
to
let
him
pass
no
one
spoke
he
was
very
uncomfortable
for
some
minutes
he
sat
pretending
to
read
a
piece
of
paper
he
found
on
the
table
then
i
forgot
that
bread
mother
he
said
there
was
no
answer
from
either
woman
well
he
said
it
only
twopence
i
can
pay
you
for
being
angry
he
put
three
pennies
on
the
table
and
slid
them
towards
his
mother
she
turned
away
her
head
her
mouth
was
shut
tightly
yes
said
annie
you
do
know
how
badly
my
mother
is
the
girl
sat
staring
glumly
into
the
fire
why
is
she
badly
asked
paul
in
his
overbearing
way
well
said
annie
she
could
scarcely
get
he
looked
closely
at
his
mother
she
looked
why
could
you
scarcely
get
home
he
asked
her
still
sharply
she
would
not
answer
i
found
her
as
white
as
a
sheet
sitting
here
said
annie
with
a
suggestion
of
tears
in
her
voice
well
why
insisted
paul
his
brows
were
knitting
his
eyes
dilating
passionately
it
was
enough
to
upset
anybody
said
morel
hugging
those
parcels
meat
and
and
a
pair
of
curtains
well
why
did
you
hug
them
you
need
have
then
who
would
let
annie
fetch
the
yes
and
i
would
fetch
the
meat
but
how
was
i
to
know
you
were
off
with
miriam
instead
of
being
in
when
my
mother
and
what
was
the
matter
with
you
asked
paul
of
his
mother
i
suppose
it
my
heart
she
replied
certainly
she
looked
bluish
round
the
mouth
and
have
you
felt
it
before
yes
often
then
why
have
you
told
me
and
why
have
you
seen
a
doctor
morel
shifted
in
her
chair
angry
with
him
for
his
hectoring
you
never
notice
anything
said
annie
you
too
eager
to
be
off
with
oh
am
i
and
any
worse
than
you
with
leonard
i
was
in
at
a
quarter
to
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
a
time
i
should
have
thought
said
morel
bitterly
that
she
have
occupied
you
so
entirely
as
to
burn
a
whole
ovenful
of
beatrice
was
here
as
well
as
very
likely
but
we
know
why
the
bread
is
why
he
flashed
because
you
were
engrossed
with
miriam
replied
morel
hotly
oh
very
well
then
it
was
not
he
replied
angrily
he
was
distressed
and
wretched
seizing
a
paper
he
began
to
read
annie
her
blouse
unfastened
her
long
ropes
of
hair
twisted
into
a
plait
went
up
to
bed
bidding
him
a
very
curt
paul
sat
pretending
to
read
he
knew
his
mother
wanted
to
upbraid
him
he
also
wanted
to
know
what
had
made
her
ill
for
he
was
troubled
so
instead
of
running
away
to
bed
as
he
would
have
liked
to
do
he
sat
and
waited
there
was
a
tense
silence
the
clock
ticked
loudly
you
better
go
to
bed
before
your
father
comes
in
said
the
mother
harshly
and
if
you
going
to
have
anything
to
eat
you
better
get
i
do
want
it
was
his
mother
custom
to
bring
him
some
trifle
for
supper
on
friday
night
the
night
of
luxury
for
the
colliers
he
was
too
angry
to
go
and
find
it
in
the
pantry
this
night
this
insulted
her
if
i
wanted
you
to
go
to
selby
on
friday
night
i
can
imagine
the
scene
said
morel
but
you
never
too
tired
to
go
if
she
will
come
for
you
nay
you
neither
want
to
eat
nor
drink
i
ca
let
her
go
ca
you
and
why
does
she
come
not
because
i
ask
she
does
come
without
you
want
her
well
what
if
i
do
want
her
he
replied
why
nothing
if
it
was
sensible
or
reasonable
but
to
go
trapseing
up
there
miles
and
miles
in
the
mud
coming
home
at
midnight
and
got
to
go
to
nottingham
in
the
morning
if
i
had
you
be
just
the
yes
i
should
because
there
no
sense
in
it
is
she
so
fascinating
that
you
must
follow
her
all
that
way
morel
was
bitterly
sarcastic
she
sat
still
with
averted
face
stroking
with
a
rhythmic
jerked
movement
the
black
sateen
of
her
apron
it
was
a
movement
that
hurt
paul
to
see
i
do
like
her
he
said
but
like
her
said
morel
in
the
same
biting
tones
it
seems
to
me
you
like
nothing
and
nobody
else
there
neither
annie
nor
me
nor
anyone
now
for
what
nonsense
mother
you
know
i
do
love
her
i
i
tell
you
i
love
her
she
does
even
walk
with
my
arm
because
i
do
want
her
then
why
do
you
fly
to
her
so
often
i
do
like
to
talk
to
her
i
never
said
i
did
but
i
do
love
is
there
nobody
else
to
talk
to
not
about
the
things
we
talk
of
there
a
lot
of
things
that
not
interested
in
that
what
things
morel
was
so
intense
that
paul
began
to
pant
why
painting
and
books
you
do
care
about
herbert
no
was
the
sad
reply
and
you
wo
at
my
well
but
i
do
now
and
miriam
does
and
how
do
you
know
morel
flashed
defiantly
that
i
should
do
you
ever
try
me
but
you
do
mother
you
know
you
do
care
whether
a
decorative
or
not
you
do
care
what
manner
it
is
how
do
you
know
i
do
care
do
you
ever
try
me
do
you
ever
talk
to
me
about
these
things
to
try
but
it
not
that
that
matters
to
you
mother
you
know
t
what
is
it
then
what
is
it
then
that
matters
to
me
she
flashed
he
knitted
his
brows
with
pain
you
old
mother
and
we
he
only
meant
that
the
interests
of
her
age
were
not
the
interests
of
his
but
he
realised
the
moment
he
had
spoken
that
he
had
said
the
wrong
thing
yes
i
know
it
well
i
am
old
and
therefore
i
may
stand
aside
i
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
you
you
only
want
me
to
wait
on
you
the
rest
is
for
he
could
not
bear
it
instinctively
he
realised
that
he
was
life
to
her
and
after
all
she
was
the
chief
thing
to
him
the
only
supreme
thing
you
know
it
is
mother
you
know
it
is
she
was
moved
to
pity
by
his
cry
it
looks
a
great
deal
like
it
she
said
half
putting
aside
her
despair
no
mother
i
really
do
love
her
i
talk
to
her
but
i
want
to
come
home
to
he
had
taken
off
his
collar
and
tie
and
rose
to
go
to
bed
as
he
stooped
to
kiss
his
mother
she
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
hid
her
face
on
his
shoulder
and
cried
in
a
whimpering
voice
so
unlike
her
own
that
he
writhed
in
agony
i
ca
bear
it
i
could
let
another
woman
but
not
her
she
leave
me
no
room
not
a
bit
of
room
and
immediately
he
hated
miriam
bitterly
and
i
never
you
know
paul
i
never
had
a
husband
not
really
he
stroked
his
mother
hair
and
his
mouth
was
on
her
throat
and
she
exults
so
in
taking
you
from
me
she
not
like
ordinary
well
i
do
love
her
mother
he
murmured
bowing
his
head
and
hiding
his
eyes
on
her
shoulder
in
misery
his
mother
kissed
him
a
long
fervent
kiss
my
boy
she
said
in
a
voice
trembling
with
passionate
love
without
knowing
he
gently
stroked
her
face
there
said
his
mother
now
go
to
bed
you
be
so
tired
in
the
as
she
was
speaking
she
heard
her
husband
coming
your
father
now
suddenly
she
looked
at
him
almost
as
if
in
fear
perhaps
i
selfish
if
you
want
her
take
her
my
his
mother
looked
so
strange
paul
kissed
her
trembling
ha
mother
he
said
softly
morel
came
in
walking
unevenly
his
hat
was
over
one
corner
of
his
eye
he
balanced
in
the
doorway
at
your
mischief
again
he
said
venomously
morel
emotion
turned
into
sudden
hate
of
the
drunkard
who
had
come
in
thus
upon
her
at
any
rate
it
is
sober
she
said
h
h
h
h
he
sneered
he
went
into
the
passage
hung
up
his
hat
and
coat
then
they
heard
him
go
down
three
steps
to
the
pantry
he
returned
with
a
piece
of
in
his
fist
it
was
what
morel
had
bought
for
her
son
nor
was
that
bought
for
you
if
you
can
give
me
no
more
than
shillings
i
sure
i
not
going
to
buy
you
to
stuff
after
you
swilled
a
bellyful
of
snarled
morel
toppling
in
his
balance
not
for
me
he
looked
at
the
piece
of
meat
and
crust
and
suddenly
in
a
vicious
spurt
of
temper
flung
it
into
the
fire
paul
started
to
his
feet
waste
your
own
stuff
he
cried
what
what
suddenly
shouted
morel
jumping
up
and
clenching
his
fist
i
show
yer
yer
young
jockey
all
right
said
paul
viciously
putting
his
head
on
one
side
show
me
he
would
at
that
moment
dearly
have
loved
to
have
a
smack
at
something
morel
was
half
crouching
fists
up
ready
to
spring
the
young
man
stood
smiling
with
his
lips
ussha
hissed
the
father
swiping
round
with
a
great
stroke
just
past
his
son
face
he
dared
not
even
though
so
close
really
touch
the
young
man
but
swerved
an
inch
away
right
said
paul
his
eyes
upon
the
side
of
his
father
mouth
where
in
another
instant
his
fist
would
have
hit
he
ached
for
that
stroke
but
he
heard
a
faint
moan
from
behind
his
mother
was
deadly
pale
and
dark
at
the
mouth
morel
was
dancing
up
to
deliver
another
blow
father
said
paul
so
that
the
word
rang
morel
started
and
stood
at
attention
mother
moaned
the
boy
mother
she
began
to
struggle
with
herself
her
open
eyes
watched
him
although
she
could
not
move
gradually
she
was
coming
to
herself
he
laid
her
down
on
the
sofa
and
ran
upstairs
for
a
little
whisky
which
at
last
she
could
sip
the
tears
were
hopping
down
his
face
as
he
kneeled
in
front
of
her
he
did
not
cry
but
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
quickly
morel
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
room
sat
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
glaring
across
what
with
he
asked
faint
replied
paul
h
the
elderly
man
began
to
unlace
his
boots
he
stumbled
off
to
bed
his
last
fight
was
fought
in
that
home
paul
kneeled
there
stroking
his
mother
hand
do
be
poorly
mother
do
be
poorly
he
said
time
after
time
it
nothing
my
boy
she
murmured
at
last
he
rose
fetched
in
a
large
piece
of
coal
and
raked
the
fire
then
he
cleared
the
room
put
everything
straight
laid
the
things
for
breakfast
and
brought
his
mother
candle
can

to
bed

mother

my
own

sleep
in
my
own
she
rose
and
he
turned
out
the
gas
then
followed
her
closely
upstairs
carrying
her
candle
on
the
landing
he
kissed
her
close
she
said
he
pressed
his
face
upon
the
pillow
in
a
fury
of
misery
and
yet
somewhere
in
his
soul
he
was
at
peace
because
he
still
loved
his
mother
best
it
was
the
bitter
peace
of
resignation
the
efforts
of
his
father
to
conciliate
him
next
day
were
a
great
humiliation
to
him
everybody
tried
to
forget
the
scene
chapter
ix
defeat
of
miriam
paul
was
dissatisfied
with
himself
and
with
everything
the
deepest
of
his
love
belonged
to
his
mother
when
he
felt
he
had
hurt
her
or
wounded
his
love
for
her
he
could
not
bear
it
now
it
was
spring
and
there
was
battle
between
him
and
miriam
this
year
he
had
a
good
deal
against
her
she
was
vaguely
aware
of
it
the
old
feeling
that
she
was
to
be
a
sacrifice
to
this
love
which
she
had
had
when
she
prayed
was
mingled
in
all
her
emotions
she
did
not
at
the
bottom
believe
she
ever
would
have
him
she
did
not
believe
in
herself
primarily
doubted
whether
she
could
ever
be
what
he
would
demand
of
her
certainly
she
never
saw
herself
living
happily
through
a
lifetime
with
him
she
saw
tragedy
sorrow
and
sacrifice
ahead
and
in
sacrifice
she
was
proud
in
renunciation
she
was
strong
for
she
did
not
trust
herself
to
support
everyday
life
she
was
prepared
for
the
big
things
and
the
deep
things
like
tragedy
it
was
the
sufficiency
of
the
small
she
could
not
trust
the
easter
holidays
began
happily
paul
was
his
own
frank
self
yet
she
felt
it
would
go
wrong
on
the
sunday
afternoon
she
stood
at
her
bedroom
window
looking
across
at
the
of
the
wood
in
whose
branches
a
twilight
was
tangled
below
the
bright
sky
of
the
afternoon
rosettes
of
honeysuckle
leaves
hung
before
the
window
some
already
she
fancied
showing
bud
it
was
spring
which
she
loved
and
dreaded
hearing
the
clack
of
the
gate
she
stood
in
suspense
it
was
a
bright
grey
day
paul
came
into
the
yard
with
his
bicycle
which
glittered
as
he
walked
usually
he
rang
his
bell
and
laughed
towards
the
house
he
walked
with
shut
lips
and
cold
cruel
bearing
that
had
something
of
a
slouch
and
a
sneer
in
it
she
knew
him
well
by
now
and
could
tell
from
that
aloof
young
body
of
his
what
was
happening
inside
him
there
was
a
cold
correctness
in
the
way
he
put
his
bicycle
in
its
place
that
made
her
heart
sink
she
came
downstairs
nervously
she
was
wearing
a
new
net
blouse
that
she
thought
became
her
it
had
a
high
collar
with
a
tiny
ruff
reminding
her
of
mary
queen
of
scots
and
making
her
she
thought
look
wonderfully
a
woman
and
dignified
at
twenty
she
was
and
luxuriously
formed
her
face
was
still
like
a
soft
rich
mask
unchangeable
but
her
eyes
once
lifted
were
wonderful
she
was
afraid
of
him
he
would
notice
her
new
blouse
he
being
in
a
hard
ironical
mood
was
entertaining
the
family
to
a
description
of
a
service
given
in
the
primitive
methodist
chapel
conducted
by
one
of
the
preachers
of
the
sect
he
sat
at
the
head
of
the
table
his
mobile
face
with
the
eyes
that
could
be
so
beautiful
shining
with
tenderness
or
dancing
with
laughter
now
taking
on
one
expression
and
then
another
in
imitation
of
various
people
he
was
mocking
his
mockery
always
hurt
her
it
was
too
near
the
reality
he
was
too
clever
and
cruel
she
felt
that
when
his
eyes
were
like
this
hard
with
mocking
hate
he
would
spare
neither
himself
nor
anybody
else
but
leivers
was
wiping
her
eyes
with
laughter
and
leivers
just
awake
from
his
sunday
nap
was
rubbing
his
head
in
amusement
the
three
brothers
sat
with
ruffled
sleepy
appearance
in
their
giving
a
guffaw
from
time
to
time
the
whole
family
loved
a
more
than
anything
he
took
no
notice
of
miriam
later
she
saw
him
remark
her
new
blouse
saw
that
the
artist
approved
but
it
won
from
him
not
a
spark
of
warmth
she
was
nervous
could
hardly
reach
the
teacups
from
the
shelves
when
the
men
went
out
to
milk
she
ventured
to
address
him
personally
you
were
late
she
said
was
i
he
answered
there
was
silence
for
a
while
was
it
rough
riding
she
asked
i
did
notice
she
continued
quickly
to
lay
the
table
when
she
had
finished
tea
wo
be
for
a
few
minutes
will
you
come
and
look
at
the
daffodils
she
said
he
rose
without
answering
they
went
out
into
the
back
garden
under
the
budding
the
hills
and
the
sky
were
clean
and
cold
everything
looked
washed
rather
hard
miriam
glanced
at
paul
he
was
pale
and
impassive
it
seemed
cruel
to
her
that
his
eyes
and
brows
which
she
loved
could
look
so
hurting
has
the
wind
made
you
tired
she
asked
she
detected
an
underneath
feeling
of
weariness
about
him
no
i
think
not
he
answered
it
must
be
rough
on
the
road
the
wood
moans
you
can
see
by
the
clouds
it
a
wind
that
helps
me
you
see
i
do
cycle
so
i
do
understand
she
murmured
is
there
need
to
cycle
to
know
that
he
said
she
thought
his
sarcasms
were
unnecessary
they
went
forward
in
silence
round
the
wild
tussocky
lawn
at
the
back
of
the
house
was
a
thorn
hedge
under
which
daffodils
were
craning
forward
from
among
their
sheaves
of
blades
the
cheeks
of
the
flowers
were
greenish
with
cold
but
still
some
had
burst
and
their
gold
ruffled
and
glowed
miriam
went
on
her
knees
before
one
cluster
took
a
daffodil
between
her
hands
turned
up
its
face
of
gold
to
her
and
bowed
down
caressing
it
with
her
mouth
and
cheeks
and
brow
he
stood
aside
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
watching
her
one
after
another
she
turned
up
to
him
the
faces
of
the
yellow
bursten
flowers
appealingly
fondling
them
lavishly
all
the
while
are
they
magnificent
she
murmured
magnificent
it
a
bit
thick
they
pretty
she
bowed
again
to
her
flowers
at
his
censure
of
her
praise
he
watched
her
crouching
sipping
the
flowers
with
fervid
kisses
why
must
you
always
be
fondling
things
he
said
irritably
but
i
love
to
touch
them
she
replied
hurt
can
you
never
like
things
without
clutching
them
as
if
you
wanted
to
pull
the
heart
out
of
them
why
do
you
have
a
bit
more
restraint
or
reserve
or
something
she
looked
up
at
him
full
of
pain
then
continued
slowly
to
stroke
her
lips
against
a
ruffled
flower
their
scent
as
she
smelled
it
was
so
much
kinder
than
he
it
almost
made
her
cry
you
wheedle
the
soul
out
of
things
he
said
i
would
never
wheedle
at
any
rate
i
go
he
scarcely
knew
what
he
was
saying
these
things
came
from
him
mechanically
she
looked
at
him
his
body
seemed
one
weapon
firm
and
hard
against
her
you
always
begging
things
to
love
you
he
said
as
if
you
were
a
beggar
for
love
even
the
flowers
you
have
to
fawn
on
them
rhythmically
miriam
was
swaying
and
stroking
the
flower
with
her
mouth
inhaling
the
scent
which
ever
after
made
her
shudder
as
it
came
to
her
nostrils
you
do
want
to
love
your
eternal
and
abnormal
craving
is
to
be
loved
you
are
positive
you
negative
you
absorb
absorb
as
if
you
must
fill
yourself
up
with
love
because
you
got
a
shortage
she
was
stunned
by
his
cruelty
and
did
not
hear
he
had
not
the
faintest
notion
of
what
he
was
saying
it
was
as
if
his
fretted
tortured
soul
run
hot
by
thwarted
passion
jetted
off
these
sayings
like
sparks
from
electricity
she
did
not
grasp
anything
he
said
she
only
sat
crouched
beneath
his
cruelty
and
his
hatred
of
her
she
never
realised
in
a
flash
over
everything
she
brooded
and
brooded
after
tea
he
stayed
with
edgar
and
the
brothers
taking
no
notice
of
miriam
she
extremely
unhappy
on
this
holiday
waited
for
him
and
at
last
he
yielded
and
came
to
her
she
was
determined
to
track
this
mood
of
his
to
its
origin
she
counted
it
not
much
more
than
a
mood
shall
we
go
through
the
wood
a
little
way
she
asked
him
knowing
he
never
refused
a
direct
request
they
went
down
to
the
warren
on
the
middle
path
they
passed
a
trap
a
narrow
horseshoe
hedge
of
small
baited
with
the
guts
of
a
rabbit
paul
glanced
at
it
frowning
she
caught
his
eye
is
it
dreadful
she
asked
i
do
know
is
it
worse
than
a
weasel
with
its
teeth
in
a
throat
one
weasel
or
many
rabbits
one
or
the
other
must
go
he
was
taking
the
bitterness
of
life
badly
she
was
rather
sorry
for
him
we
will
go
back
to
the
house
he
said
i
do
want
to
walk
they
went
past
the
whose
bronze
were
coming
unfastened
just
a
fragment
remained
of
the
haystack
a
monument
squared
and
brown
like
a
pillar
of
stone
there
was
a
little
bed
of
hay
from
the
last
cutting
let
us
sit
here
a
minute
said
miriam
he
sat
down
against
his
will
resting
his
back
against
the
hard
wall
of
hay
they
faced
the
amphitheatre
of
round
hills
that
glowed
with
sunset
tiny
white
farms
standing
out
the
meadows
golden
the
woods
dark
and
yet
luminous
folded
over
distinct
in
the
distance
the
evening
had
cleared
and
the
east
was
tender
with
a
magenta
flush
under
which
the
land
lay
still
and
rich
is
it
beautiful
she
pleaded
but
he
only
scowled
he
would
rather
have
had
it
ugly
just
then
at
that
moment
a
big
came
rushing
up
pranced
his
two
paws
on
the
youth
shoulders
licking
his
face
paul
drew
back
laughing
bill
was
a
great
relief
to
him
he
pushed
the
dog
aside
but
it
came
leaping
back
get
out
said
the
lad
or
i
dot
thee
but
the
dog
was
not
to
be
pushed
away
so
paul
had
a
little
battle
with
the
creature
pitching
poor
bill
away
from
him
who
however
only
floundered
tumultuously
back
again
wild
with
joy
the
two
fought
together
the
man
laughing
grudgingly
the
dog
grinning
all
over
miriam
watched
them
there
was
something
pathetic
about
the
man
he
wanted
so
badly
to
love
to
be
tender
the
rough
way
he
bowled
the
dog
over
was
really
loving
bill
got
up
panting
with
happiness
his
brown
eyes
rolling
in
his
white
face
and
lumbered
back
again
he
adored
paul
the
lad
frowned
bill
i
had
enough
o
thee
he
said
but
the
dog
only
stood
with
two
heavy
paws
that
quivered
with
love
upon
his
thigh
and
flickered
a
red
tongue
at
him
he
drew
back
no
he
said
no
i
had
and
in
a
minute
the
dog
trotted
off
happily
to
vary
the
fun
he
remained
staring
miserably
across
at
the
hills
whose
still
beauty
he
begrudged
he
wanted
to
go
and
cycle
with
edgar
yet
he
had
not
the
courage
to
leave
miriam
why
are
you
sad
she
asked
humbly
i
not
sad
why
should
i
be
he
answered
i
only
she
wondered
why
he
always
claimed
to
be
normal
when
he
was
disagreeable
but
what
is
the
matter
she
pleaded
coaxing
him
soothingly
nothing
nay
she
murmured
he
picked
up
a
stick
and
began
to
stab
the
earth
with
it
you
far
better
not
talk
he
said
but
i
wish
to
know
she
replied
he
laughed
resentfully
you
always
do
he
said
it
not
fair
to
me
she
murmured
he
thrust
thrust
thrust
at
the
ground
with
the
pointed
stick
digging
up
little
clods
of
earth
as
if
he
were
in
a
fever
of
irritation
she
gently
and
firmly
laid
her
band
on
his
wrist
do
she
said
put
it
he
flung
the
stick
into
the
and
leaned
back
now
he
was
bottled
up
what
is
it
she
pleaded
softly
he
lay
perfectly
still
only
his
eyes
alive
and
they
full
of
torment
you
know
he
said
at
length
rather
wearily
you
know
we
better
break
it
was
what
she
dreaded
swiftly
everything
seemed
to
darken
before
her
eyes
why
she
murmured
what
has
happened
nothing
has
happened
we
only
realise
where
we
are
it
no
good
she
waited
in
silence
sadly
patiently
it
was
no
good
being
impatient
with
him
at
any
rate
he
would
tell
her
now
what
ailed
him
we
agreed
on
friendship
he
went
on
in
a
dull
monotonous
voice
how
often
have
we
agreed
for
friendship
and
yet
it
neither
stops
there
nor
gets
anywhere
he
was
silent
again
she
brooded
what
did
he
mean
he
was
so
wearying
there
was
something
he
would
not
yield
yet
she
must
be
patient
with
him
i
can
only
give
friendship
it
all
i
capable
of
it
a
flaw
in
my
the
thing
overbalances
to
one
side
i
hate
a
toppling
balance
let
us
have
there
was
warmth
of
fury
in
his
last
phrases
he
meant
she
loved
him
more
than
he
her
perhaps
he
could
not
love
her
perhaps
she
had
not
in
herself
that
which
he
wanted
it
was
the
deepest
motive
of
her
soul
this
it
was
so
deep
she
dared
neither
realise
nor
acknowledge
perhaps
she
was
deficient
like
an
infinitely
subtle
shame
it
kept
her
always
back
if
it
were
so
she
would
do
without
him
she
would
never
let
herself
want
him
she
would
merely
see
but
what
has
happened
she
said
nothing
it
all
in
myself
it
only
comes
out
just
now
we
always
like
this
towards
he
grovelled
so
helplessly
she
pitied
him
at
least
she
never
floundered
in
such
a
pitiable
way
after
all
it
was
he
who
was
chiefly
humiliated
what
do
you
want
she
asked
him
why
i
must
come
often
that
all
why
should
i
monopolise
you
when
i
not
you
see
i
deficient
in
something
with
regard
to
you
he
was
telling
her
he
did
not
love
her
and
so
ought
to
leave
her
a
chance
with
another
man
how
foolish
and
blind
and
shamefully
clumsy
he
was
what
were
other
men
to
her
what
were
men
to
her
at
all
but
he
ah
she
loved
his
soul
was
he
deficient
in
something
perhaps
he
was
but
i
do
understand
she
said
huskily
yesterday
the
night
was
turning
jangled
and
hateful
to
him
as
the
twilight
faded
and
she
bowed
under
her
suffering
i
know
he
cried
you
never
will
you
never
believe
that
i
ca
ca
physically
any
more
than
i
can
fly
up
like
a
skylark
what
she
murmured
now
she
dreaded
love
he
hated
her
bitterly
at
that
moment
because
he
made
her
suffer
love
her
she
knew
he
loved
her
he
really
belonged
to
her
this
about
not
loving
her
physically
bodily
was
a
mere
perversity
on
his
part
because
he
knew
she
loved
him
he
was
stupid
like
a
child
he
belonged
to
her
his
soul
wanted
her
she
guessed
somebody
had
been
influencing
him
she
felt
upon
him
the
hardness
the
foreignness
of
another
influence
what
have
they
been
saying
at
home
she
asked
it
not
that
he
answered
and
then
she
knew
it
was
she
despised
them
for
their
commonness
his
people
they
did
not
know
what
things
were
really
worth
he
and
she
talked
very
little
more
that
night
after
all
he
left
her
to
cycle
with
edgar
he
had
come
back
to
his
mother
hers
was
the
strongest
tie
in
his
life
when
he
thought
round
miriam
shrank
away
there
was
a
vague
unreal
feel
about
her
and
nobody
else
mattered
there
was
one
place
in
the
world
that
stood
solid
and
did
not
melt
into
unreality
the
place
where
his
mother
was
everybody
else
could
grow
shadowy
almost
to
him
but
she
could
not
it
was
as
if
the
pivot
and
pole
of
his
life
from
which
he
could
not
escape
was
his
mother
and
in
the
same
way
she
waited
for
him
in
him
was
established
her
life
now
after
all
the
life
beyond
offered
very
little
to
morel
she
saw
that
our
chance
for
doing
is
here
and
doing
counted
with
her
paul
was
going
to
prove
that
she
had
been
right
he
was
going
to
make
a
man
whom
nothing
should
shift
off
his
feet
he
was
going
to
alter
the
face
of
the
earth
in
some
way
which
mattered
wherever
he
went
she
felt
her
soul
went
with
him
whatever
he
did
she
felt
her
soul
stood
by
him
ready
as
it
were
to
hand
him
his
tools
she
could
not
bear
it
when
he
was
with
miriam
william
was
dead
she
would
fight
to
keep
paul
and
he
came
back
to
her
and
in
his
soul
was
a
feeling
of
the
satisfaction
of
because
he
was
faithful
to
her
she
loved
him
first
he
loved
her
first
and
yet
it
was
not
enough
his
new
young
life
so
strong
and
imperious
was
urged
towards
something
else
it
made
him
mad
with
restlessness
she
saw
this
and
wished
bitterly
that
miriam
had
been
a
woman
who
could
take
this
new
life
of
his
and
leave
her
the
roots
he
fought
against
his
mother
almost
as
he
fought
against
miriam
it
was
a
week
before
he
went
again
to
willey
farm
miriam
had
suffered
a
great
deal
and
was
afraid
to
see
him
again
was
she
now
to
endure
the
ignominy
of
his
abandoning
her
that
would
only
be
superficial
and
temporary
he
would
come
back
she
held
the
keys
to
his
soul
but
meanwhile
how
he
would
torture
her
with
his
battle
against
her
she
shrank
from
it
however
the
sunday
after
easter
he
came
to
tea
leivers
was
glad
to
see
him
she
gathered
something
was
fretting
him
that
he
found
things
hard
he
seemed
to
drift
to
her
for
comfort
and
she
was
good
to
him
she
did
him
that
great
kindness
of
treating
him
almost
with
reverence
he
met
her
with
the
young
children
in
the
front
garden
i
glad
you
come
said
the
mother
looking
at
him
with
her
great
appealing
brown
eyes
it
is
such
a
sunny
day
i
was
just
going
down
the
fields
for
the
first
time
this
he
felt
she
would
like
him
to
come
that
soothed
him
they
went
talking
simply
he
gentle
and
humble
he
could
have
wept
with
gratitude
that
she
was
deferential
to
him
he
was
feeling
humiliated
at
the
bottom
of
the
mow
close
they
found
a
thrush
nest
shall
i
show
you
the
eggs
he
said
do
replied
leivers
they
seem
such
a
sign
of
spring
and
so
he
put
aside
the
thorns
and
took
out
the
eggs
holding
them
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
they
are
quite
hot
i
think
we
frightened
her
off
them
he
said
ay
poor
thing
said
leivers
miriam
could
not
help
touching
the
eggs
and
his
hand
which
it
seemed
to
her
cradled
them
so
well
is
it
a
strange
warmth
she
murmured
to
get
near
him
blood
heat
he
answered
she
watched
him
putting
them
back
his
body
pressed
against
the
hedge
his
arm
reaching
slowly
through
the
thorns
his
hand
folded
carefully
over
the
eggs
he
was
concentrated
on
the
act
seeing
him
so
she
loved
him
he
seemed
so
simple
and
sufficient
to
himself
and
she
could
not
get
to
him
after
tea
she
stood
hesitating
at
the
bookshelf
he
took
tartarin
de
tarascon
again
they
sat
on
the
bank
of
hay
at
the
foot
of
the
stack
he
read
a
couple
of
pages
but
without
any
heart
for
it
again
the
dog
came
racing
up
to
repeat
the
fun
of
the
other
day
he
shoved
his
muzzle
in
the
man
chest
paul
fingered
his
ear
for
a
moment
then
he
pushed
him
away
go
away
bill
he
said
i
do
want
bill
slunk
off
and
miriam
wondered
and
dreaded
what
was
coming
there
was
a
silence
about
the
youth
that
made
her
still
with
apprehension
it
was
not
his
furies
but
his
quiet
resolutions
that
she
feared
turning
his
face
a
little
to
one
side
so
that
she
could
not
see
him
he
began
speaking
slowly
and
painfully
do
you
think
if
i
did
come
up
so
much
you
might
get
to
like
somebody
else
another
man
so
this
was
what
he
was
still
harping
on
but
i
do
know
any
other
men
why
do
you
ask
she
replied
in
a
low
tone
that
should
have
been
a
reproach
to
him
why
he
blurted
because
they
say
i
no
right
to
come
up
like
this
without
we
mean
to
marry
miriam
was
indignant
at
anybody
forcing
the
issues
between
them
she
had
been
furious
with
her
own
father
for
suggesting
to
paul
laughingly
that
he
knew
why
he
came
so
much
who
says
she
asked
wondering
if
her
people
had
anything
to
do
with
it
they
had
not
mother
and
the
others
they
say
at
this
rate
everybody
will
consider
me
engaged
and
i
ought
to
consider
myself
so
because
it
not
fair
to
you
and
i
tried
to
find
out
and
i
do
think
i
love
you
as
a
man
ought
to
love
his
wife
what
do
you
think
about
it
miriam
bowed
her
head
moodily
she
was
angry
at
having
this
struggle
people
should
leave
him
and
her
alone
i
do
know
she
murmured
do
you
think
we
love
each
other
enough
to
marry
he
asked
definitely
it
made
her
tremble
no
she
answered
truthfully
i
do
think
so
we
too
i
thought
perhaps
he
went
on
miserably
that
you
with
your
intensity
in
things
might
have
given
me
more
than
i
could
ever
make
up
to
you
and
even
now
if
you
think
it
better
we
be
now
miriam
wanted
to
cry
and
she
was
angry
too
he
was
always
such
a
child
for
people
to
do
as
they
liked
with
no
i
do
think
so
she
said
firmly
he
pondered
a
minute
you
see
he
said
with
me
i
do
think
one
person
would
ever
monopolize
me
be
everything
to
me
i
think
this
she
did
not
consider
no
she
murmured
then
after
a
pause
she
looked
at
him
and
her
dark
eyes
flashed
this
is
your
mother
she
said
i
know
she
never
liked
no
no
it
is
he
said
hastily
it
was
for
your
sake
she
spoke
this
time
she
only
said
if
i
was
going
on
i
ought
to
consider
myself
there
was
a
silence
and
if
i
ask
you
to
come
down
any
time
you
wo
stop
away
will
you
she
did
not
answer
by
this
time
she
was
very
angry
well
what
shall
we
do
she
said
shortly
i
suppose
i
better
drop
french
i
was
just
beginning
to
get
on
with
it
but
i
suppose
i
can
go
on
i
do
see
that
we
need
he
said
i
can
give
you
a
french
lesson
well
and
there
are
sunday
nights
i
sha
stop
coming
to
chapel
because
i
enjoy
it
and
it
all
the
social
life
i
get
but
you
no
need
to
come
home
with
me
i
can
go
all
right
he
answered
rather
taken
aback
but
if
i
ask
edgar
always
come
with
us
and
then
they
can
say
there
was
silence
after
all
then
she
would
not
lose
much
for
all
their
talk
down
at
his
home
there
would
not
be
much
difference
she
wished
they
would
mind
their
own
business
and
you
wo
think
about
it
and
let
it
trouble
you
will
you
he
asked
oh
no
replied
miriam
without
looking
at
him
he
was
silent
she
thought
him
unstable
he
had
no
fixity
of
purpose
no
anchor
of
righteousness
that
held
him
because
he
continued
a
man
gets
across
his
bicycle
and
goes
to
work
and
does
all
sorts
of
things
but
a
woman
no
i
sha
bother
said
miriam
and
she
meant
it
it
had
gone
rather
chilly
they
went
indoors
how
white
paul
looks
leivers
exclaimed
miriam
you
have
let
him
sit
out
of
doors
do
you
think
you
taken
cold
paul
oh
no
he
laughed
but
he
felt
done
up
it
wore
him
out
the
conflict
in
himself
miriam
pitied
him
now
but
quite
early
before
nine
he
rose
to
go
you
not
going
home
are
you
asked
leivers
anxiously
yes
he
replied
i
said
i
be
he
was
very
awkward
but
this
is
early
said
leivers
miriam
sat
in
the
and
did
not
speak
he
hesitated
expecting
her
to
rise
and
go
with
him
to
the
barn
as
usual
for
his
bicycle
she
remained
as
she
was
he
was
at
a
loss
well
all
he
faltered
she
spoke
her
along
with
all
the
others
but
as
he
went
past
the
window
he
looked
in
she
saw
him
pale
his
brows
knit
slightly
in
a
way
that
had
become
constant
with
him
his
eyes
dark
with
pain
she
rose
and
went
to
the
doorway
to
wave
to
him
as
he
passed
through
the
gate
he
rode
slowly
under
the
feeling
a
cur
and
a
miserable
wretch
his
bicycle
went
tilting
down
the
hills
at
random
he
thought
it
would
be
a
relief
to
break
one
neck
two
days
later
he
sent
her
up
a
book
and
a
little
note
urging
her
to
read
and
be
busy
at
this
time
he
gave
all
his
friendship
to
edgar
he
loved
the
family
so
much
he
loved
the
farm
so
much
it
was
the
dearest
place
on
earth
to
him
his
home
was
not
so
lovable
it
was
his
mother
but
then
he
would
have
been
just
as
happy
with
his
mother
anywhere
whereas
willey
farm
he
loved
passionately
he
loved
the
little
pokey
kitchen
where
men
boots
tramped
and
the
dog
slept
with
one
eye
open
for
fear
of
being
trodden
on
where
the
lamp
hung
over
the
table
at
night
and
everything
was
so
silent
he
loved
miriam
long
low
parlour
with
its
atmosphere
of
romance
its
flowers
its
books
its
high
rosewood
piano
he
loved
the
gardens
and
the
buildings
that
stood
with
their
scarlet
roofs
on
the
naked
edges
of
the
fields
crept
towards
the
wood
as
if
for
cosiness
the
wild
country
scooping
down
a
valley
and
up
the
uncultured
hills
of
the
other
side
only
to
be
there
was
an
exhilaration
and
a
joy
to
him
he
loved
leivers
with
her
unworldliness
and
her
quaint
cynicism
he
loved
leivers
so
warm
and
young
and
lovable
he
loved
edgar
who
lit
up
when
he
came
and
the
boys
and
the
children
and
bill
even
the
sow
circe
and
the
indian
called
tippoo
all
this
besides
miriam
he
could
not
give
it
up
so
he
went
as
often
but
he
was
usually
with
edgar
only
all
the
family
including
the
father
joined
in
charades
and
games
at
evening
and
later
miriam
drew
them
together
and
they
read
macbeth
out
of
penny
books
taking
parts
it
was
great
excitement
miriam
was
glad
and
leivers
was
glad
and
leivers
enjoyed
it
then
they
all
learned
songs
together
from
tonic
singing
in
a
circle
round
the
fire
but
now
paul
was
very
rarely
alone
with
miriam
she
waited
when
she
and
edgar
and
he
walked
home
together
from
chapel
or
from
the
literary
society
in
bestwood
she
knew
his
talk
so
passionate
and
so
unorthodox
nowadays
was
for
her
she
did
envy
edgar
however
his
cycling
with
paul
his
friday
nights
his
days
working
in
the
fields
for
her
friday
nights
and
her
french
lessons
were
gone
she
was
nearly
always
alone
walking
pondering
in
the
wood
reading
studying
dreaming
waiting
and
he
wrote
to
her
frequently
one
sunday
evening
they
attained
to
their
old
rare
harmony
edgar
had
stayed
to
communion
he
wondered
what
it
was
like
with
morel
so
paul
came
on
alone
with
miriam
to
his
home
he
was
more
or
less
under
her
spell
again
as
usual
they
were
discussing
the
sermon
he
was
setting
now
full
sail
towards
agnosticism
but
such
a
religious
agnosticism
that
miriam
did
not
suffer
so
badly
they
were
at
the
renan
vie
de
jesus
stage
miriam
was
the
on
which
he
threshed
out
all
his
beliefs
while
he
trampled
his
ideas
upon
her
soul
the
truth
came
out
for
him
she
alone
was
his
she
alone
helped
him
towards
realization
almost
impassive
she
submitted
to
his
argument
and
expounding
and
somehow
because
of
her
he
gradually
realized
where
he
was
wrong
and
what
he
realized
she
realized
she
felt
he
could
not
do
without
her
they
came
to
the
silent
house
he
took
the
key
out
of
the
scullery
window
and
they
entered
all
the
time
he
went
on
with
his
discussion
he
lit
the
gas
mended
the
fire
and
brought
her
some
cakes
from
the
pantry
she
sat
on
the
sofa
quietly
with
a
plate
on
her
knee
she
wore
a
large
white
hat
with
some
pinkish
flowers
it
was
a
cheap
hat
but
he
liked
it
her
face
beneath
was
still
and
pensive
and
ruddy
always
her
ears
were
hid
in
her
short
curls
she
watched
him
she
liked
him
on
sundays
then
he
wore
a
dark
suit
that
showed
the
lithe
movement
of
his
body
there
was
a
clean
look
about
him
he
went
on
with
his
thinking
to
her
suddenly
he
reached
for
a
bible
miriam
liked
the
way
he
reached
up
so
sharp
straight
to
the
mark
he
turned
the
pages
quickly
and
read
her
a
chapter
of
john
as
he
sat
in
the
armchair
reading
intent
his
voice
only
thinking
she
felt
as
if
he
were
using
her
unconsciously
as
a
man
uses
his
tools
at
some
work
he
is
bent
on
she
loved
it
and
the
wistfulness
of
his
voice
was
like
a
reaching
to
something
and
it
was
as
if
she
were
what
he
reached
with
she
sat
back
on
the
sofa
away
from
him
and
yet
feeling
herself
the
very
instrument
his
hand
grasped
it
gave
her
great
pleasure
then
he
began
to
falter
and
to
get
and
when
he
came
to
the
verse
a
woman
when
she
is
in
travail
hath
sorrow
because
her
hour
is
come
he
missed
it
out
miriam
had
felt
him
growing
uncomfortable
she
shrank
when
the
words
did
not
follow
he
went
on
reading
but
she
did
not
hear
a
grief
and
shame
made
her
bend
her
head
six
months
ago
he
would
have
read
it
simply
now
there
was
a
scotch
in
his
running
with
her
now
she
felt
there
was
really
something
hostile
between
them
something
of
which
they
were
ashamed
she
ate
her
cake
mechanically
he
tried
to
go
on
with
his
argument
but
could
not
get
back
the
right
note
soon
edgar
came
in
morel
had
gone
to
her
friends
the
three
set
off
to
willey
farm
miriam
brooded
over
his
split
with
her
there
was
something
else
he
wanted
he
could
not
be
satisfied
he
could
give
her
no
peace
there
was
between
them
now
always
a
ground
for
strife
she
wanted
to
prove
him
she
believed
that
his
chief
need
in
life
was
herself
if
she
could
prove
it
both
to
herself
and
to
him
the
rest
might
go
she
could
simply
trust
to
the
future
so
in
may
she
asked
him
to
come
to
willey
farm
and
meet
dawes
there
was
something
he
hankered
after
she
saw
him
whenever
they
spoke
of
clara
dawes
rouse
and
get
slightly
angry
he
said
he
did
not
like
her
yet
he
was
keen
to
know
about
her
well
he
should
put
himself
to
the
test
she
believed
that
there
were
in
him
desires
for
higher
things
and
desires
for
lower
and
that
the
desire
for
the
higher
would
conquer
at
any
rate
he
should
try
she
forgot
that
her
higher
and
lower
were
arbitrary
he
was
rather
excited
at
the
idea
of
meeting
clara
at
willey
farm
dawes
came
for
the
day
her
heavy
hair
was
coiled
on
top
of
her
head
she
wore
a
white
blouse
and
navy
skirt
and
somehow
wherever
she
was
seemed
to
make
things
look
paltry
and
insignificant
when
she
was
in
the
room
the
kitchen
seemed
too
small
and
mean
altogether
miriam
beautiful
twilighty
parlour
looked
stiff
and
stupid
all
the
leivers
were
eclipsed
like
candles
they
found
her
rather
hard
to
put
up
with
yet
she
was
perfectly
amiable
but
indifferent
and
rather
hard
paul
did
not
come
till
afternoon
he
was
early
as
he
swung
off
his
bicycle
miriam
saw
him
look
round
at
the
house
eagerly
he
would
be
disappointed
if
the
visitor
had
not
come
miriam
went
out
to
meet
him
bowing
her
head
because
of
the
sunshine
nasturtiums
were
coming
out
crimson
under
the
cool
green
shadow
of
their
leaves
the
girl
stood
glad
to
see
him
has
clara
come
he
asked
yes
replied
miriam
in
her
musical
tone
she
he
wheeled
his
bicycle
into
the
barn
he
had
put
on
a
handsome
tie
of
which
he
was
rather
proud
and
socks
to
match
she
came
this
morning
he
asked
yes
replied
miriam
as
she
walked
at
his
side
you
said
you
bring
me
that
letter
from
the
man
at
liberty
have
you
remembered
oh
dash
no
he
said
but
nag
at
me
till
you
get
i
do
like
to
nag
at
do
it
whether
or
not
and
is
she
any
more
agreeable
he
continued
you
know
i
always
think
she
is
quite
he
was
silent
evidently
his
eagerness
to
be
early
had
been
the
newcomer
miriam
already
began
to
suffer
they
went
together
towards
the
house
he
took
the
clips
off
his
trousers
but
was
too
lazy
to
brush
the
dust
from
his
shoes
in
spite
of
the
socks
and
tie
clara
sat
in
the
cool
parlour
reading
he
saw
the
nape
of
her
white
neck
and
the
fine
hair
lifted
from
it
she
rose
looking
at
him
indifferently
to
shake
hands
she
lifted
her
arm
straight
in
a
manner
that
seemed
at
once
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
and
yet
to
fling
something
to
him
he
noticed
how
her
breasts
swelled
inside
her
blouse
and
how
her
shoulder
curved
handsomely
under
the
thin
muslin
at
the
top
of
her
arm
you
have
chosen
a
fine
day
he
said
it
happens
so
she
said
yes
he
said
i
am
she
sat
down
not
thanking
him
for
his
politeness
what
have
you
been
doing
all
morning
asked
paul
of
miriam
well
you
see
said
miriam
coughing
huskily
clara
only
came
with
father
and
so
she
not
been
here
very
clara
sat
leaning
on
the
table
holding
aloof
he
noticed
her
hands
were
large
but
well
kept
and
the
skin
on
them
seemed
almost
coarse
opaque
and
white
with
fine
golden
hairs
she
did
not
mind
if
he
observed
her
hands
she
intended
to
scorn
him
her
heavy
arm
lay
negligently
on
the
table
her
mouth
was
closed
as
if
she
were
offended
and
she
kept
her
face
slightly
averted
you
were
at
margaret
bonford
meeting
the
other
evening
he
said
to
her
miriam
did
not
know
this
courteous
paul
clara
glanced
at
him
yes
she
said
why
asked
miriam
how
do
you
know
i
went
in
for
a
few
minutes
before
the
train
came
he
answered
clara
turned
away
again
rather
disdainfully
i
think
she
a
lovable
little
woman
said
paul
margaret
bonford
exclaimed
clara
she
a
great
deal
cleverer
than
most
well
i
did
say
she
was
he
said
deprecating
she
lovable
for
all
and
of
course
that
is
all
that
matters
said
clara
witheringly
he
rubbed
his
head
rather
perplexed
rather
annoyed
i
suppose
it
matters
more
than
her
cleverness
he
said
which
after
all
would
never
get
her
to
it
not
heaven
she
wants
to
get
it
her
fair
share
on
earth
retorted
clara
she
spoke
as
if
he
were
responsible
for
some
deprivation
which
miss
bonford
suffered
well
he
said
i
thought
she
was
warm
and
awfully
nice
only
too
frail
i
wished
she
was
sitting
comfortably
in
peace
her
husband
stockings
said
clara
scathingly
i
sure
she
would
mind
darning
even
my
stockings
he
said
and
i
sure
she
do
them
well
just
as
i
would
mind
blacking
her
boots
if
she
wanted
me
but
clara
refused
to
answer
this
sally
of
his
he
talked
to
miriam
for
a
little
while
the
other
woman
held
aloof
well
he
said
i
think
i
go
and
see
edgar
is
he
on
the
land
i
believe
said
miriam
he
gone
for
a
load
of
coal
he
should
be
back
then
he
said
i
go
and
meet
miriam
dared
not
propose
anything
for
the
three
of
them
he
rose
and
left
them
on
the
top
road
where
the
gorse
was
out
he
saw
edgar
walking
lazily
beside
the
mare
who
nodded
her
forehead
as
she
dragged
the
clanking
load
of
coal
the
young
farmer
face
lighted
up
as
he
saw
his
friend
edgar
was
with
dark
warm
eyes
his
clothes
were
old
and
rather
disreputable
and
he
walked
with
considerable
pride
hello
he
said
seeing
paul
bareheaded
where
are
you
going
came
to
meet
you
ca
stand
edgar
teeth
flashed
in
a
laugh
of
amusement
who
is
he
asked
the
lady
dawes
it
ought
to
be
mrs
the
raven
that
quothed
edgar
laughed
with
glee
do
you
like
her
he
asked
not
a
fat
lot
said
paul
why
do
you
no
the
answer
came
with
a
deep
ring
of
conviction
no
edgar
pursed
up
his
lips
i
ca
say
she
much
in
my
he
mused
a
little
then
but
why
do
you
call
her
he
asked
well
said
paul
if
she
looks
at
a
man
she
says
haughtily
and
if
she
looks
at
herself
in
the
she
says
disdainfully
and
if
she
thinks
back
she
says
it
in
disgust
and
if
she
looks
forward
she
says
it
edgar
considered
this
speech
failed
to
make
much
out
of
it
and
said
laughing
you
think
she
a
she
thinks
she
is
replied
paul
but
you
do
think
so
no
replied
paul
was
she
nice
with
you
then
could
you
imagine
her
nice
with
anybody
asked
the
young
man
edgar
laughed
together
they
unloaded
the
coal
in
the
yard
paul
was
rather
because
he
knew
clara
could
see
if
she
looked
out
of
the
window
she
did
look
on
saturday
afternoons
the
horses
were
brushed
down
and
groomed
paul
and
edgar
worked
together
sneezing
with
the
dust
that
came
from
the
pelts
of
jimmy
and
flower
do
you
know
a
new
song
to
teach
me
said
edgar
he
continued
to
work
all
the
time
the
back
of
his
neck
was
when
he
bent
down
and
his
fingers
that
held
the
brush
were
thick
paul
watched
him
sometimes
morrison
suggested
the
younger
edgar
agreed
he
had
a
good
tenor
voice
and
he
loved
to
learn
all
the
songs
his
friend
could
teach
him
so
that
he
could
sing
whilst
he
was
carting
paul
had
a
very
indifferent
baritone
voice
but
a
good
ear
however
he
sang
softly
for
fear
of
clara
edgar
repeated
the
line
in
a
clear
tenor
at
times
they
both
broke
off
to
sneeze
and
first
one
then
the
other
abused
his
horse
miriam
was
impatient
of
men
it
took
so
little
to
amuse
them
even
paul
she
thought
it
anomalous
in
him
that
he
could
be
so
thoroughly
absorbed
in
a
triviality
it
was
when
they
had
finished
what
song
was
that
asked
miriam
edgar
told
her
the
conversation
turned
to
singing
we
have
such
jolly
times
miriam
said
to
clara
dawes
ate
her
meal
in
a
slow
dignified
way
whenever
the
men
were
present
she
grew
distant
do
you
like
singing
miriam
asked
her
if
it
is
good
she
said
paul
of
course
coloured
you
mean
if
it
is
and
trained
he
said
i
think
a
voice
needs
training
before
the
singing
is
anything
she
said
you
might
as
well
insist
on
having
people
voices
trained
before
you
allowed
them
to
talk
he
replied
really
people
sing
for
their
own
pleasure
as
a
and
it
may
be
for
other
people
then
the
other
people
should
have
flaps
to
their
ears
he
replied
the
boys
laughed
there
was
a
silence
he
flushed
deeply
and
ate
in
silence
after
tea
when
all
the
men
had
gone
but
paul
leivers
said
to
clara
and
you
find
life
happier
now
and
you
are
satisfied
so
long
as
i
can
be
free
and
and
you
do
miss
anything
in
your
life
asked
leivers
gently
i
put
all
that
behind
paul
had
been
feeling
uncomfortable
during
this
discourse
he
got
up
you
find
you
always
tumbling
over
the
things
you
put
behind
you
he
said
then
he
took
his
departure
to
the
cowsheds
he
felt
he
had
been
witty
and
his
manly
pride
was
high
he
whistled
as
he
went
down
the
brick
track
miriam
came
for
him
a
little
later
to
know
if
he
would
go
with
clara
and
her
for
a
walk
they
set
off
down
to
strelley
mill
farm
as
they
were
going
beside
the
brook
on
the
willey
water
side
looking
through
the
brake
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
where
pink
campions
glowed
under
a
few
sunbeams
they
saw
beyond
the
and
the
thin
hazel
bushes
a
man
leading
a
great
bay
horse
through
the
gullies
the
big
red
beast
seemed
to
dance
romantically
through
that
dimness
of
green
hazel
drift
away
there
where
the
air
was
shadowy
as
if
it
were
in
the
past
among
the
fading
bluebells
that
might
have
bloomed
for
deidre
or
iseult
the
three
stood
charmed
what
a
treat
to
be
a
knight
he
said
and
to
have
a
pavilion
and
to
have
us
shut
up
safely
replied
clara
yes
he
answered
singing
with
your
maids
at
your
broidery
i
would
carry
your
banner
of
white
and
green
and
heliotrope
i
would
have
emblazoned
on
my
shield
beneath
a
woman
i
have
no
doubt
said
clara
that
you
would
much
rather
fight
for
a
woman
than
let
her
fight
for
i
would
when
she
fights
for
herself
she
seems
like
a
dog
before
a
gone
into
a
mad
fury
with
its
own
and
you
are
the
she
asked
with
a
curl
of
the
lip
or
the
shadow
he
replied
i
am
afraid
she
said
that
you
are
too
well
i
leave
it
to
you
to
be
good
he
retorted
laughing
be
good
sweet
maid
and
just
let
me
be
but
clara
wearied
of
his
flippancy
suddenly
looking
at
her
he
saw
that
the
upward
lifting
of
her
face
was
misery
and
not
scorn
his
heart
grew
tender
for
everybody
he
turned
and
was
gentle
with
miriam
whom
he
had
neglected
till
then
at
the
wood
edge
they
met
limb
a
thin
swarthy
man
of
forty
tenant
of
strelley
mill
which
he
ran
as
a
farm
he
held
the
halter
of
the
powerful
stallion
indifferently
as
if
he
were
tired
the
three
stood
to
let
him
pass
over
the
of
the
first
brook
paul
admired
that
so
large
an
animal
should
walk
on
such
springy
toes
with
an
endless
excess
of
vigour
limb
pulled
up
before
them
tell
your
father
miss
leivers
he
said
in
a
peculiar
piping
voice
that
his
young
broke
that
bottom
fence
three
days
which
asked
miriam
tremulous
the
great
horse
breathed
heavily
shifting
round
its
red
flanks
and
looking
suspiciously
with
its
wonderful
big
eyes
upwards
from
under
its
lowered
head
and
falling
mane
come
along
a
bit
replied
limb
an
i
show
the
man
and
the
stallion
went
forward
it
danced
sideways
shaking
its
white
fetlocks
and
looking
frightened
as
it
felt
itself
in
the
brook
no
said
the
man
affectionately
to
the
beast
it
went
up
the
bank
in
little
leaps
then
splashed
finely
through
the
second
brook
clara
walking
with
a
kind
of
sulky
abandon
watched
it
limb
stopped
and
pointed
to
the
fence
under
some
willows
there
you
see
where
they
got
through
he
said
my
man
druv
back
three
yes
answered
miriam
colouring
as
if
she
were
at
fault
are
you
comin
in
asked
the
man
no
thanks
but
we
should
like
to
go
by
the
well
just
as
you
a
mind
he
said
the
horse
gave
little
whinneys
of
pleasure
at
being
so
near
home
he
is
glad
to
be
back
said
clara
who
was
interested
in
the
creature
yes
been
a
tidy
step
they
went
through
the
gate
and
saw
approaching
them
from
the
big
farmhouse
a
smallish
dark
woman
of
about
her
hair
was
touched
with
grey
her
dark
eyes
looked
wild
she
walked
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
her
brother
went
forward
as
it
saw
her
the
big
bay
stallion
whinneyed
again
she
came
up
excitedly
are
you
home
again
my
boy
she
said
tenderly
to
the
horse
not
to
the
man
the
great
beast
shifted
round
to
her
ducking
his
head
she
smuggled
into
his
mouth
the
wrinkled
yellow
apple
she
had
been
hiding
behind
her
back
then
she
kissed
him
near
the
eyes
he
gave
a
big
sigh
of
pleasure
she
held
his
head
in
her
arms
against
her
breast
is
he
splendid
said
miriam
to
her
miss
limb
looked
up
her
dark
eyes
glanced
straight
at
paul

leivers

said
it
ages
since

miriam
introduced
her
friends

horse

fellow
said
clara

he
again
she
kissed
him
as
loving
as
any
man
more
loving

most
men
i
should
think
replied
clara
he
a
nice
boy
cried
the
woman
again
embracing
the
horse
clara
fascinated
by
the
big
beast
went
up
to
stroke
his
neck
he
quite
gentle
said
miss
limb

think

a
beauty
replied
clara
she
wanted
to
look
in
his
eyes

wanted
him
to
look
at
her
it
a
pity
he
ca
talk
she
said
oh

her

horse

do
do
you
fish
morel
no
said
paul
because
if
you
do
you
might
come
and
fish
any
time
said
miss
limb
we
scarcely
see
a
soul
from
week
end
to
week
end
i
should
be
what
fish
are
there
in
the
pond
he
asked
they
went
through
the
front
garden
over
the
sluice
and
up
the
steep
bank
to
the
pond
which
lay
in
shadow
with
its
two
wooded
islets
paul
walked
with
miss
limb
i
should
mind
swimming
here
he
said
do
she
replied
come
when
you
like
my
brother
will
be
awfully
pleased
to
talk
with
you
he
is
so
quiet
because
there
is
no
one
to
talk
to
do
come
and
clara
came
up
it
a
fine
depth
she
said
and
so
yes
said
miss
limb
do
you
swim
said
paul
miss
limb
was
just
saying
we
could
come
when
we
of
course
there
the
said
miss
limb
they
talked
a
few
moments
then
went
on
up
the
wild
hill
leaving
the
lonely
woman
on
the
bank
the
hillside
was
all
ripe
with
sunshine
it
was
wild
and
tussocky
given
over
to
rabbits
the
three
walked
in
silence
then
she
makes
me
feel
uncomfortable
said
paul
you
mean
miss
limb
asked
miriam
what
a
matter
with
her
is
she
going
dotty
with
being
too
lonely
yes
said
miriam
it
not
the
right
sort
of
life
for
her
i
think
it
cruel
to
bury
her
there
i
really
ought
to
go
and
see
her
more
but
she
upsets
she
makes
me
feel
sorry
for
her
yes
and
she
bothers
me
he
said
i
suppose
blurted
clara
suddenly
she
wants
a
the
other
two
were
silent
for
a
few
moments
but
it
the
loneliness
sends
her
cracked
said
paul
clara
did
not
answer
but
strode
on
uphill
she
was
walking
with
her
hand
hanging
her
legs
swinging
as
she
kicked
through
the
dead
thistles
and
the
tussocky
grass
her
arms
hanging
loose
rather
than
walking
her
handsome
body
seemed
to
be
blundering
up
the
hill
a
hot
wave
went
over
paul
he
was
curious
about
her
perhaps
life
had
been
cruel
to
her
he
forgot
miriam
who
was
walking
beside
him
talking
to
him
she
glanced
at
him
finding
he
did
not
answer
her
his
eyes
were
fixed
ahead
on
clara
do
you
still
think
she
is
disagreeable
she
asked
he
did
not
notice
that
the
question
was
sudden
it
ran
with
his
thoughts
something
the
matter
with
her
he
said
yes
answered
miriam
they
found
at
the
top
of
the
hill
a
hidden
wild
field
two
sides
of
which
were
backed
by
the
wood
the
other
sides
by
high
loose
hedges
of
hawthorn
and
elder
bushes
between
these
overgrown
bushes
were
gaps
that
the
cattle
might
have
walked
through
had
there
been
any
cattle
now
there
the
turf
was
smooth
as
velveteen
padded
and
holed
by
the
rabbits
the
field
itself
was
coarse
and
crowded
with
tall
big
cowslips
that
had
never
been
cut
clusters
of
strong
flowers
rose
everywhere
above
the
coarse
tussocks
of
bent
it
was
like
a
roadstead
crowded
with
tan
fairy
shipping
ah
cried
miriam
and
she
looked
at
paul
her
dark
eyes
dilating
he
smiled
together
they
enjoyed
the
field
of
flowers
clara
a
little
way
off
was
looking
at
the
cowslips
disconsolately
paul
and
miriam
stayed
close
together
talking
in
subdued
tones
he
kneeled
on
one
knee
quickly
gathering
the
best
blossoms
moving
from
tuft
to
tuft
restlessly
talking
softly
all
the
time
miriam
plucked
the
flowers
lovingly
lingering
over
them
he
always
seemed
to
her
too
quick
and
almost
scientific
yet
his
bunches
had
a
natural
beauty
more
than
hers
he
loved
them
but
as
if
they
were
his
and
he
had
a
right
to
them
she
had
more
reverence
for
them
they
held
something
she
had
not
the
flowers
were
very
fresh
and
sweet
he
wanted
to
drink
them
as
he
gathered
them
he
ate
the
little
yellow
trumpets
clara
was
still
wandering
about
disconsolately
going
towards
her
he
said
why
do
you
get
some
i
do
believe
in
it
they
look
better
but
you
like
some
they
want
to
be
i
do
believe
they
i
do
want
the
corpses
of
flowers
about
me
she
said
that
a
stiff
artificial
notion
he
said
they
do
die
any
quicker
in
water
than
on
their
roots
and
besides
they
look
nice
in
a
bowl
they
look
jolly
and
you
only
call
a
thing
a
corpse
because
it
looks
whether
it
is
one
or
not
she
argued
it
is
one
to
me
a
dead
flower
is
a
corpse
of
a
clara
now
ignored
him
and
even
so
what
right
have
you
to
pull
them
she
asked
because
i
like
them
and
want
them
and
there
plenty
of
and
that
is
sufficient
yes
why
not
i
sure
they
smell
nice
in
your
room
in
and
i
should
have
the
pleasure
of
watching
them
but
then
it
does
not
matter
if
they
do
whereupon
he
left
her
and
went
stooping
over
the
clumps
of
tangled
flowers
which
thickly
sprinkled
the
field
like
pale
luminous
miriam
had
come
close
clara
was
kneeling
breathing
some
scent
from
the
cowslips
i
think
said
miriam
if
you
treat
them
with
reverence
you
do
do
them
any
harm
it
is
the
spirit
you
pluck
them
in
that
yes
he
said
but
no
you
get
because
you
want
and
he
held
out
his
bunch
miriam
was
silent
he
picked
some
more
look
at
these
he
continued
sturdy
and
lusty
like
little
trees
and
like
boys
with
fat
clara
hat
lay
on
the
grass
not
far
off
she
was
kneeling
bending
forward
still
to
smell
the
flowers
her
neck
gave
him
a
sharp
pang
such
a
beautiful
thing
yet
not
proud
of
itself
just
now
her
breasts
swung
slightly
in
her
blouse
the
arching
curve
of
her
back
was
beautiful
and
strong
she
wore
no
stays
suddenly
without
knowing
he
was
scattering
a
handful
of
cowslips
over
her
hair
and
neck
saying
ashes
to
ashes
and
dust
to
dust
if
the
lord
wo
have
you
the
devil
the
chill
flowers
fell
on
her
neck
she
looked
up
at
him
with
almost
pitiful
scared
grey
eyes
wondering
what
he
was
doing
flowers
fell
on
her
face
and
she
shut
her
eyes
suddenly
standing
there
above
her
he
felt
awkward
i
thought
you
wanted
a
funeral
he
said
ill
at
ease
clara
laughed
strangely
and
rose
picking
the
cowslips
from
her
hair
she
took
up
her
hat
and
pinned
it
on
one
flower
had
remained
tangled
in
her
hair
he
saw
but
would
not
tell
her
he
gathered
up
the
flowers
he
had
sprinkled
over
her
at
the
edge
of
the
wood
the
bluebells
had
flowed
over
into
the
field
and
stood
there
like
but
they
were
fading
now
clara
strayed
up
to
them
he
wandered
after
her
the
bluebells
pleased
him
look
how
they
come
out
of
the
wood
he
said
then
she
turned
with
a
flash
of
warmth
and
of
gratitude
yes
she
smiled
his
blood
beat
up
it
makes
me
think
of
the
wild
men
of
the
woods
how
terrified
they
would
be
when
they
got
breast
to
breast
with
the
open
do
you
think
they
were
she
asked
i
wonder
which
was
more
frightened
among
old
tribes
those
bursting
out
of
their
darkness
of
woods
upon
all
the
space
of
light
or
those
from
the
open
tiptoeing
into
the
i
should
think
the
second
she
answered
yes
you
do
feel
like
one
of
the
open
space
sort
trying
to
force
yourself
into
the
dark
do
you
how
should
i
know
she
answered
queerly
the
conversation
ended
there
the
evening
was
deepening
over
the
earth
already
the
valley
was
full
of
shadow
one
tiny
square
of
light
stood
opposite
at
crossleigh
bank
farm
brightness
was
swimming
on
the
tops
of
the
hills
miriam
came
up
slowly
her
face
in
her
big
loose
bunch
of
flowers
walking
through
the
scattered
froth
of
the
cowslips
beyond
her
the
trees
were
coming
into
shape
all
shadow
shall
we
go
she
asked
and
the
three
turned
away
they
were
all
silent
going
down
the
path
they
could
see
the
light
of
home
right
across
and
on
the
ridge
of
the
hill
a
thin
dark
outline
with
little
lights
where
the
colliery
village
touched
the
sky
it
has
been
nice
has
it
he
asked
miriam
murmured
assent
clara
was
silent
do
you
think
so
he
persisted
but
she
walked
with
her
head
up
and
still
did
not
answer
he
could
tell
by
the
way
she
moved
as
if
she
did
care
that
she
suffered
at
this
time
paul
took
his
mother
to
lincoln
she
was
bright
and
enthusiastic
as
ever
but
as
he
sat
opposite
her
in
the
railway
carriage
she
seemed
to
look
frail
he
had
a
momentary
sensation
as
if
she
were
slipping
away
from
him
then
he
wanted
to
get
hold
of
her
to
fasten
her
almost
to
chain
her
he
felt
he
must
keep
hold
of
her
with
his
hand
they
drew
near
to
the
city
both
were
at
the
window
looking
for
the
cathedral
there
she
is
mother
he
cried
they
saw
the
great
cathedral
lying
couchant
above
the
plain
ah
she
exclaimed
so
she
is
he
looked
at
his
mother
her
blue
eyes
were
watching
the
cathedral
quietly
she
seemed
again
to
be
beyond
him
something
in
the
eternal
repose
of
the
uplifted
cathedral
blue
and
noble
against
the
sky
was
reflected
in
her
something
of
the
fatality
what
was
was
with
all
his
young
will
he
could
not
alter
it
he
saw
her
face
the
skin
still
fresh
and
pink
and
downy
but
near
her
eyes
her
eyelids
steady
sinking
a
little
her
mouth
always
closed
with
disillusion
and
there
was
on
her
the
same
eternal
look
as
if
she
knew
fate
at
last
he
beat
against
it
with
all
the
strength
of
his
soul
look
mother
how
big
she
is
above
the
town
think
there
are
streets
and
streets
below
her
she
looks
bigger
than
the
city
so
she
does
exclaimed
his
mother
breaking
bright
into
life
again
but
he
had
seen
her
sitting
looking
steady
out
of
the
window
at
the
cathedral
her
face
and
eyes
fixed
reflecting
the
relentlessness
of
life
and
the
near
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
shut
so
hard
made
him
feel
he
would
go
mad
they
ate
a
meal
that
she
considered
wildly
extravagant
do
imagine
i
like
it
she
said
as
she
ate
her
cutlet
i
like
it
i
really
do
just
think
of
your
money
wasted
you
never
mind
my
money
he
said
you
forget
i
a
fellow
taking
his
girl
for
an
and
he
bought
her
some
blue
violets
stop
it
at
once
sir
she
commanded
how
can
i
do
it
you
got
nothing
to
do
stand
still
and
in
the
middle
of
high
street
he
stuck
the
flowers
in
her
coat
an
old
thing
like
me
she
said
sniffing
you
see
he
said
i
want
people
to
think
we
awful
swells
so
look
i
jowl
your
head
she
laughed
strut
he
commanded
be
a
fantail
it
took
him
an
hour
to
get
her
through
the
street
she
stood
above
glory
hole
she
stood
before
stone
bow
she
stood
everywhere
and
exclaimed
a
man
came
up
took
off
his
hat
and
bowed
to
her
can
i
show
you
the
town
madam
no
thank
you
she
answered
i
got
my
then
paul
was
cross
with
her
for
not
answering
with
more
dignity
you
go
away
with
you
she
exclaimed
ha
that
the
jew
house
now
do
you
remember
that
lecture
paul
but
she
could
scarcely
climb
the
cathedral
hill
he
did
not
notice
then
suddenly
he
found
her
unable
to
speak
he
took
her
into
a
little
where
she
rested
it
nothing
she
said
my
heart
is
only
a
bit
old
one
must
expect
he
did
not
answer
but
looked
at
her
again
his
heart
was
crushed
in
a
hot
grip
he
wanted
to
cry
he
wanted
to
smash
things
in
fury
they
set
off
again
pace
by
pace
so
slowly
and
every
step
seemed
like
a
weight
on
his
chest
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
would
burst
at
last
they
came
to
the
top
she
stood
enchanted
looking
at
the
castle
gate
looking
at
the
cathedral
front
she
had
quite
forgotten
herself
now
this
is
better
than
i
thought
it
could
be
she
cried
but
he
hated
it
everywhere
he
followed
her
brooding
they
sat
together
in
the
cathedral
they
attended
a
little
service
in
the
choir
she
was
timid
i
suppose
it
is
open
to
anybody
she
asked
him
yes
he
replied
do
you
think
they
have
the
damned
cheek
to
send
us
well
i
sure
she
exclaimed
they
would
if
they
heard
your
her
face
seemed
to
shine
again
with
joy
and
peace
during
the
service
and
all
the
time
he
was
wanting
to
rage
and
smash
things
and
cry
afterwards
when
they
were
leaning
over
the
wall
looking
at
the
town
below
he
blurted
suddenly
why
ca
a
man
have
a
young
mother
what
is
she
old
for
well
his
mother
laughed
she
can
scarcely
help
and
why
was
i
the
oldest
son
look
they
say
the
young
ones
have
the
advantage
but
look
they
had
the
young
mother
you
should
have
had
me
for
your
eldest
i
did
arrange
it
she
remonstrated
come
to
consider
you
as
much
to
blame
as
he
turned
on
her
white
his
eyes
furious
what
are
you
old
for
he
said
mad
with
his
impotence
why
ca
you
walk
why
ca
you
come
with
me
to
places
at
one
time
she
replied
i
could
have
run
up
that
hill
a
good
deal
better
than
what
the
good
of
that
to
me
he
cried
hitting
his
fist
on
the
wall
then
he
became
plaintive
it
too
bad
of
you
to
be
little
it
is
ill
she
cried
i
a
bit
old
and
you
have
to
put
up
with
it
that
they
were
quiet
but
it
was
as
much
as
they
could
bear
they
got
jolly
again
over
tea
as
they
sat
by
brayford
watching
the
boats
he
told
her
about
clara
his
mother
asked
him
innumerable
questions
then
who
does
she
live
with
with
her
mother
on
bluebell
and
have
they
enough
to
keep
them
i
do
think
so
i
think
they
do
lace
and
wherein
lies
her
charm
my
boy
i
do
know
that
she
charming
mother
but
she
nice
and
she
seems
straight
you
know
not
a
bit
deep
not
a
but
she
a
good
deal
older
than
she
thirty
i
going
on
you
have
told
me
what
you
like
her
because
i
do
know
a
sort
of
defiant
way
she
got
a
sort
of
angry
morel
considered
she
would
have
been
glad
now
for
her
son
to
fall
in
love
with
some
woman
who
would
she
did
not
know
what
but
he
fretted
so
got
so
furious
suddenly
and
again
was
melancholic
she
wished
he
knew
some
nice
woman
she
did
not
know
what
she
wished
but
left
it
vague
at
any
rate
she
was
not
hostile
to
the
idea
of
clara
annie
too
was
getting
married
leonard
had
gone
away
to
work
in
birmingham
one
when
he
was
home
she
had
said
to
him
you
do
look
very
well
my
i
dunno
he
said
i
feel
anyhow
or
nohow
he
called
her
ma
already
in
his
boyish
fashion
are
you
sure
they
good
lodgings
she
asked
yes
yes
only
it
a
winder
when
you
have
to
pour
your
own
tea
out
an
nobody
to
grouse
if
you
team
it
in
your
saucer
and
sup
it
up
it
somehow
takes
a
the
taste
out
of
morel
laughed
and
so
it
knocks
you
up
she
said
i
dunno
i
want
to
get
married
he
blurted
twisting
his
fingers
and
looking
down
at
his
boots
there
was
a
silence
but
she
exclaimed
i
thought
you
said
you
wait
another
yes
i
did
say
so
he
replied
stubbornly
again
she
considered
and
you
know
she
said
annie
a
bit
of
a
spendthrift
she
saved
no
more
than
eleven
pounds
and
i
know
lad
you
have
had
much
he
coloured
up
to
the
ears
i
got
quid
he
said
it
does
go
far
she
answered
he
said
nothing
but
twisted
his
fingers
and
you
know
she
said
i
nothing
i
did
want
ma
he
cried
very
red
suffering
and
remonstrating
no
my
lad
i
know
i
was
only
wishing
i
had
and
take
away
five
pounds
for
the
wedding
and
things
it
leaves
pounds
you
wo
do
much
on
he
twisted
still
impotent
stubborn
not
looking
up
but
do
you
really
want
to
get
married
she
asked
do
you
feel
as
if
you
ought
he
gave
her
one
straight
look
from
his
blue
eyes
yes
he
said
then
she
replied
we
must
all
do
the
best
we
can
for
it
the
next
time
he
looked
up
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
i
do
want
annie
to
feel
handicapped
he
said
struggling
my
lad
she
said
you
steady
you
got
a
decent
place
if
a
man
had
needed
me
i
have
married
him
on
his
last
week
wages
she
may
find
it
a
bit
hard
to
start
humbly
young
girls
are
like
that
they
look
forward
to
the
fine
home
they
think
they
have
but
i
had
expensive
furniture
it
not
so
the
wedding
took
place
almost
immediately
arthur
came
home
and
was
splendid
in
uniform
annie
looked
nice
in
a
dress
that
she
could
take
for
sundays
morel
called
her
a
fool
for
getting
married
and
was
cool
with
his
morel
had
white
tips
in
her
bonnet
and
some
white
on
her
blouse
and
was
teased
by
both
her
sons
for
fancying
herself
so
grand
leonard
was
jolly
and
cordial
and
felt
a
fearful
fool
paul
could
not
quite
see
what
annie
wanted
to
get
married
for
he
was
fond
of
her
and
she
of
him
still
he
hoped
rather
lugubriously
that
it
would
turn
out
all
right
arthur
was
astonishingly
handsome
in
his
scarlet
and
yellow
and
he
knew
it
well
but
was
secretly
ashamed
of
the
uniform
annie
cried
her
eyes
up
in
the
kitchen
on
leaving
her
mother
morel
cried
a
little
then
patted
her
on
the
back
and
said
but
do
cry
child
he
be
good
to
morel
stamped
and
said
she
was
a
fool
to
go
and
tie
herself
up
leonard
looked
white
and
overwrought
morel
said
to
him
i
s
trust
her
to
you
my
lad
and
hold
you
responsible
for
you
can
he
said
nearly
dead
with
the
ordeal
and
it
was
all
over
when
morel
and
arthur
were
in
bed
paul
sat
talking
as
he
often
did
with
his
mother
you
not
sorry
she
married
mother
are
you
he
asked
i
not
sorry
she
married
but
it
seems
strange
that
she
should
go
from
me
it
even
seems
to
me
hard
that
she
can
prefer
to
go
with
her
leonard
that
how
mothers
are
i
know
it
and
shall
you
be
miserable
about
her
when
i
think
of
my
own
wedding
day
his
mother
answered
i
can
only
hope
her
life
will
be
but
you
can
trust
him
to
be
good
to
her
yes
yes
they
say
he
not
good
enough
for
her
but
i
say
if
a
man
is
genuine
as
he
is
and
a
girl
is
fond
of
him
then
it
should
be
all
right
he
as
good
as
so
you
do
mind
i
would
never
have
let
a
daughter
of
mine
marry
a
man
i
did
feel
to
be
genuine
through
and
through
and
yet
there
a
gap
now
she
they
were
both
miserable
and
wanted
her
back
again
it
seemed
to
paul
his
mother
looked
lonely
in
her
new
black
silk
blouse
with
its
bit
of
white
trimming
at
any
rate
mother
i
s
never
marry
he
said
ay
they
all
say
that
my
lad
you
not
met
the
one
yet
only
wait
a
year
or
but
i
sha
marry
mother
i
shall
live
with
you
and
we
have
a
ay
my
lad
it
easy
to
talk
we
see
when
the
time
what
time
i
nearly
yes
you
not
one
that
would
marry
young
but
in
three
years
time
i
shall
be
with
you
just
the
we
see
my
boy
we
but
you
do
want
me
to
marry
i
should
like
to
think
of
you
going
through
your
life
without
anybody
to
care
for
you
and
do
and
you
think
i
ought
to
marry
sooner
or
later
every
man
but
you
rather
it
were
it
would
be
hard
and
very
hard
it
as
they
say
son
my
son
till
he
takes
him
a
wife
but
my
daughter
my
daughter
the
whole
of
her
life
and
you
think
i
let
a
wife
take
me
from
you
well
you
would
ask
her
to
marry
your
mother
as
well
as
you
morel
smiled
she
could
do
what
she
liked
she
would
have
to
she
would
till
she
got
you
and
then
you
i
never
will
see
i
never
marry
while
i
got
you
i
but
i
should
like
to
leave
you
with
nobody
my
boy
she
cried
you
not
going
to
leave
me
what
are
you
i
give
you
till
there
you
are
i
fat
and
then
marry
a
staid
body
see
his
mother
sat
and
laughed
go
to
bed
she
said
go
to
and
we
have
a
pretty
house
you
and
me
and
a
servant
and
it
be
just
all
right
i
s
perhaps
be
rich
with
my
will
you
go
to
bed
and
then
you
s
have
a
see
yourself
a
little
queen
victoria
trotting
i
tell
you
to
go
to
bed
she
laughed
he
kissed
her
and
went
his
plans
for
the
future
were
always
the
same
morel
sat
brooding
about
her
daughter
about
paul
about
arthur
she
fretted
at
losing
annie
the
family
was
very
closely
bound
and
she
felt
she
must
live
now
to
be
with
her
children
life
was
so
rich
for
her
paul
wanted
her
and
so
did
arthur
arthur
never
knew
how
deeply
he
loved
her
he
was
a
creature
of
the
moment
never
yet
had
he
been
forced
to
realise
himself
the
army
had
disciplined
his
body
but
not
his
soul
he
was
in
perfect
health
and
very
handsome
his
dark
vigorous
hair
sat
close
to
his
smallish
head
there
was
something
childish
about
his
nose
something
almost
girlish
about
his
dark
blue
eyes
but
he
had
the
fun
red
mouth
of
a
man
under
his
brown
moustache
and
his
jaw
was
strong
it
was
his
father
mouth
it
was
the
nose
and
eyes
of
her
own
people
folk
morel
was
anxious
about
him
once
he
had
really
run
the
rig
he
was
safe
but
how
far
would
he
go
the
army
had
not
really
done
him
any
good
he
resented
bitterly
the
authority
of
the
officers
he
hated
having
to
obey
as
if
he
were
an
animal
but
he
had
too
much
sense
to
kick
so
he
turned
his
attention
to
getting
the
best
out
of
it
he
could
sing
he
was
a
often
he
got
into
scrapes
but
they
were
the
manly
scrapes
that
are
easily
condoned
so
he
made
a
good
time
out
of
it
whilst
his
was
in
suppression
he
trusted
to
his
good
looks
and
handsome
figure
his
refinement
his
decent
education
to
get
him
most
of
what
he
wanted
and
he
was
not
disappointed
yet
he
was
restless
something
seemed
to
gnaw
him
inside
he
was
never
still
he
was
never
alone
with
his
mother
he
was
rather
humble
paul
he
admired
and
loved
and
despised
slightly
and
paul
admired
and
loved
and
despised
him
slightly
morel
had
had
a
few
pounds
left
to
her
by
her
father
and
she
decided
to
buy
her
son
out
of
the
army
he
was
wild
with
joy
now
he
was
like
a
lad
taking
a
holiday
he
had
always
been
fond
of
beatrice
wyld
and
during
his
furlough
he
picked
up
with
her
again
she
was
stronger
and
better
in
health
the
two
often
went
long
walks
together
arthur
taking
her
arm
in
fashion
rather
stiffly
and
she
came
to
play
the
piano
whilst
he
sang
then
arthur
would
unhook
his
tunic
collar
he
grew
flushed
his
eyes
were
bright
he
sang
in
a
manly
tenor
afterwards
they
sat
together
on
the
sofa
he
seemed
to
flaunt
his
body
she
was
aware
of
him
so
the
strong
chest
the
sides
the
thighs
in
their
trousers
he
liked
to
lapse
into
the
dialect
when
he
talked
to
her
she
would
sometimes
smoke
with
him
occasionally
she
would
only
take
a
few
whiffs
at
his
cigarette
nay
he
said
to
her
one
evening
when
she
reached
for
his
cigarette
nay
tha
doesna
i
thee
a
smoke
kiss
if
ter
a
i
wanted
a
whiff
no
kiss
at
all
she
answered
well
an
tha
a
whiff
he
said
along
wi
t
i
want
a
draw
at
thy
fag
she
cried
snatching
for
the
cigarette
between
his
lips
he
was
sitting
with
his
shoulder
touching
her
she
was
small
and
quick
as
lightning
he
just
escaped
i
thee
a
smoke
kiss
he
said
a
knivey
nuisance
arty
morel
she
said
sitting
back
a
smoke
kiss
the
soldier
leaned
forward
to
her
smiling
his
face
was
near
hers
shonna
she
replied
turning
away
her
head
he
took
a
draw
at
his
cigarette
and
pursed
up
his
mouth
and
put
his
lips
close
to
her
his
cropped
moustache
stood
out
like
a
brush
she
looked
at
the
puckered
crimson
lips
then
suddenly
snatched
the
cigarette
from
his
fingers
and
darted
away
he
leaping
after
her
seized
the
comb
from
her
back
hair
she
turned
threw
the
cigarette
at
him
he
picked
it
up
put
it
in
his
mouth
and
sat
down
nuisance
she
cried
give
me
my
comb
she
was
afraid
that
her
hair
specially
done
for
him
would
come
down
she
stood
with
her
hands
to
her
head
he
hid
the
comb
between
his
knees
i
non
got
it
he
said
the
cigarette
trembled
between
his
lips
with
laughter
as
he
spoke
liar
she
said
true
as
i
here
he
laughed
showing
his
hands
you
brazen
imp
she
exclaimed
rushing
and
scuffling
for
the
comb
which
he
had
under
his
knees
as
she
wrestled
with
him
pulling
at
his
smooth
knees
he
laughed
till
he
lay
back
on
the
sofa
shaking
with
laughter
the
cigarette
fell
from
his
mouth
almost
singeing
his
throat
under
his
delicate
tan
the
blood
flushed
up
and
he
laughed
till
his
blue
eyes
were
blinded
his
throat
swollen
almost
to
choking
then
he
sat
up
beatrice
was
putting
in
her
comb
tha
tickled
me
beat
he
said
thickly
like
a
flash
her
small
white
hand
went
out
and
smacked
his
face
he
started
up
glaring
at
her
they
stared
at
each
other
slowly
the
flush
mounted
her
cheek
she
dropped
her
eyes
then
her
head
he
sat
down
sulkily
she
went
into
the
scullery
to
adjust
her
hair
in
private
there
she
shed
a
few
tears
she
did
not
know
what
for
when
she
returned
she
was
pursed
up
close
but
it
was
only
a
film
over
her
fire
he
with
ruffled
hair
was
sulking
upon
the
sofa
she
sat
down
opposite
in
the
armchair
and
neither
spoke
the
clock
ticked
in
the
silence
like
blows
you
are
a
little
cat
beat
he
said
at
length
half
apologetically
well
you
should
be
brazen
she
replied
there
was
again
a
long
silence
he
whistled
to
himself
like
a
man
much
agitated
but
defiant
suddenly
she
went
across
to
him
and
kissed
him
did
it
pore
fing
she
mocked
he
lifted
his
face
smiling
curiously
kiss
he
invited
her
dare
i
she
asked
go
on
he
challenged
his
mouth
lifted
to
her
deliberately
and
with
a
peculiar
quivering
smile
that
seemed
to
overspread
her
whole
body
she
put
her
mouth
on
his
immediately
his
arms
folded
round
her
as
soon
as
the
long
kiss
was
finished
she
drew
back
her
head
from
him
put
her
delicate
fingers
on
his
neck
through
the
open
collar
then
she
closed
her
eyes
giving
herself
up
again
in
a
kiss
she
acted
of
her
own
free
will
what
she
would
do
she
did
and
made
nobody
responsible
paul
felt
life
changing
around
him
the
conditions
of
youth
were
gone
now
it
was
a
home
of
people
annie
was
a
married
woman
arthur
was
following
his
own
pleasure
in
a
way
unknown
to
his
folk
for
so
long
they
had
all
lived
at
home
and
gone
out
to
pass
their
time
but
now
for
annie
and
arthur
life
lay
outside
their
mother
house
they
came
home
for
holiday
and
for
rest
so
there
was
that
strange
feeling
about
the
house
as
if
the
birds
had
flown
paul
became
more
and
more
unsettled
annie
and
arthur
had
gone
he
was
restless
to
follow
yet
home
was
for
him
beside
his
mother
and
still
there
was
something
else
something
outside
something
he
wanted
he
grew
more
and
more
restless
miriam
did
not
satisfy
him
his
old
mad
desire
to
be
with
her
grew
weaker
sometimes
he
met
clara
in
nottingham
sometimes
he
went
to
meetings
with
her
sometimes
he
saw
her
at
willey
farm
but
on
these
last
occasions
the
situation
became
strained
there
was
a
triangle
of
antagonism
between
paul
and
clara
and
miriam
with
clara
he
took
on
a
smart
worldly
mocking
tone
very
antagonistic
to
miriam
it
did
not
matter
what
went
before
she
might
be
intimate
and
sad
with
him
then
as
soon
as
clara
appeared
it
all
vanished
and
he
played
to
the
newcomer
miriam
had
one
beautiful
evening
with
him
in
the
hay
he
had
been
on
the
and
having
finished
came
to
help
her
to
put
the
hay
in
cocks
then
he
talked
to
her
of
his
hopes
and
despairs
and
his
whole
soul
seemed
to
lie
bare
before
her
she
felt
as
if
she
watched
the
very
quivering
stuff
of
life
in
him
the
moon
came
out
they
walked
home
together
he
seemed
to
have
come
to
her
because
he
needed
her
so
badly
and
she
listened
to
him
gave
him
all
her
love
and
her
faith
it
seemed
to
her
he
brought
her
the
best
of
himself
to
keep
and
that
she
would
guard
it
all
her
life
nay
the
sky
did
not
cherish
the
stars
more
surely
and
eternally
than
she
would
guard
the
good
in
the
soul
of
paul
morel
she
went
on
home
alone
feeling
exalted
glad
in
her
faith
and
then
the
next
day
clara
came
they
were
to
have
tea
in
the
hayfield
miriam
watched
the
evening
drawing
to
gold
and
shadow
and
all
the
time
paul
was
sporting
with
clara
he
made
higher
and
higher
heaps
of
hay
that
they
were
jumping
over
miriam
did
not
care
for
the
game
and
stood
aside
edgar
and
geoffrey
and
maurice
and
clara
and
paul
jumped
paul
won
because
he
was
light
clara
blood
was
roused
she
could
run
like
an
amazon
paul
loved
the
determined
way
she
rushed
at
the
and
leaped
landed
on
the
other
side
her
breasts
shaken
her
thick
hair
come
undone
you
touched
he
cried
you
touched
no
she
flashed
turning
to
edgar
i
did
touch
did
i
was
i
clear
i
could
say
laughed
edgar
none
of
them
could
say
but
you
touched
said
paul
you
i
did
not
touch
she
cried
as
plain
as
anything
said
paul
box
his
ears
for
me
she
cried
to
edgar
nay
edgar
laughed
i
dare
you
must
do
it
and
nothing
can
alter
the
fact
that
you
touched
laughed
paul
she
was
furious
with
him
her
little
triumph
before
these
lads
and
men
was
gone
she
had
forgotten
herself
in
the
game
now
he
was
to
humble
her
i
think
you
are
despicable
she
said
and
again
he
laughed
in
a
way
that
tortured
miriam
and
i
knew
you
could
jump
that
heap
he
teased
she
turned
her
back
on
him
yet
everybody
could
see
that
the
only
person
she
listened
to
or
was
conscious
of
was
he
and
he
of
her
it
pleased
the
men
to
see
this
battle
between
them
but
miriam
was
tortured
paul
could
choose
the
lesser
in
place
of
the
higher
she
saw
he
could
be
unfaithful
to
himself
unfaithful
to
the
real
deep
paul
morel
there
was
a
danger
of
his
becoming
frivolous
of
his
running
after
his
satisfaction
like
any
arthur
or
like
his
father
it
made
miriam
bitter
to
think
that
he
should
throw
away
his
soul
for
this
flippant
traffic
of
triviality
with
clara
she
walked
in
bitterness
and
silence
while
the
other
two
rallied
each
other
and
paul
sported
and
afterwards
he
would
not
own
it
but
he
was
rather
ashamed
of
himself
and
prostrated
himself
before
miriam
then
again
he
rebelled
it
not
religious
to
be
religious
he
said
i
reckon
a
crow
is
religious
when
it
sails
across
the
sky
but
it
only
does
it
because
it
feels
itself
carried
to
where
it
going
not
because
it
thinks
it
is
being
but
miriam
knew
that
one
should
be
religious
in
everything
have
god
whatever
god
might
be
present
in
everything
i
do
believe
god
knows
such
a
lot
about
himself
he
cried
god
does
know
things
he
is
things
and
i
sure
he
not
and
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
paul
was
arguing
god
on
to
his
own
side
because
he
wanted
his
own
way
and
his
own
pleasure
there
was
a
long
battle
between
him
and
her
he
was
utterly
unfaithful
to
her
even
in
her
own
presence
then
he
was
ashamed
then
repentant
then
he
hated
her
and
went
off
again
those
were
the
conditions
she
fretted
him
to
the
bottom
of
his
soul
there
she
remained
sad
pensive
a
worshipper
and
he
caused
her
sorrow
half
the
time
he
grieved
for
her
half
the
time
he
hated
her
she
was
his
conscience
and
he
felt
somehow
he
had
got
a
conscience
that
was
too
much
for
him
he
could
not
leave
her
because
in
one
way
she
did
hold
the
best
of
him
he
could
not
stay
with
her
because
she
did
not
take
the
rest
of
him
which
was
so
he
chafed
himself
into
rawness
over
her
when
she
was
he
wrote
her
a
letter
which
could
only
have
been
written
to
her
may
i
speak
of
our
old
worn
love
this
last
time
it
too
is
changing
is
it
not
say
has
not
the
body
of
that
love
died
and
left
you
its
invulnerable
soul
you
see
i
can
give
you
a
spirit
love
i
have
given
it
you
this
long
long
time
but
not
embodied
passion
see
you
are
a
nun
i
have
given
you
what
i
would
give
a
holy
nun
as
a
mystic
monk
to
a
mystic
nun
surely
you
esteem
it
best
yet
you
regret
no
have
regretted
the
other
in
all
our
relations
no
body
enters
i
do
not
talk
to
you
through
the
senses
rather
through
the
spirit
that
is
why
we
can
not
love
in
the
common
sense
ours
is
not
an
everyday
affection
as
yet
we
are
mortal
and
to
live
side
by
side
with
one
another
would
be
dreadful
for
somehow
with
you
i
can
not
long
be
trivial
and
you
know
to
be
always
beyond
this
mortal
state
would
be
to
lose
it
if
people
marry
they
must
live
together
as
affectionate
humans
who
may
be
commonplace
with
each
other
without
feeling
awkward
not
as
two
souls
so
i
feel
it
ought
i
to
send
this
letter
i
doubt
it
but
there
it
is
best
to
understand
au
miriam
read
this
letter
twice
after
which
she
sealed
it
up
a
year
later
she
broke
the
seal
to
show
her
mother
the
letter
you
are
a
nun
you
are
a
the
words
went
into
her
heart
again
and
again
nothing
he
ever
had
said
had
gone
into
her
so
deeply
fixedly
like
a
mortal
wound
she
answered
him
two
days
after
the
party
intimacy
would
have
been
but
for
one
little
mistake
she
quoted
was
the
mistake
mine
almost
immediately
he
replied
to
her
from
nottingham
sending
her
at
the
same
time
a
little
omar
i
am
glad
you
answered
you
are
so
calm
and
natural
you
put
me
to
shame
what
a
ranter
i
am
we
are
often
out
of
sympathy
but
in
fundamentals
we
may
always
be
together
i
think
i
must
thank
you
for
your
sympathy
with
my
painting
and
drawing
many
a
sketch
is
dedicated
to
you
i
do
look
forward
to
your
criticisms
which
to
my
shame
and
glory
are
always
grand
appreciations
it
is
a
lovely
joke
that
au
this
was
the
end
of
the
first
phase
of
paul
love
affair
he
was
now
about
years
old
and
though
still
virgin
the
sex
instinct
that
miriam
had
for
so
long
now
grew
particularly
strong
often
as
he
talked
to
clara
dawes
came
that
thickening
and
quickening
of
his
blood
that
peculiar
concentration
in
the
breast
as
if
something
were
alive
there
a
new
self
or
a
new
centre
of
consciousness
warning
him
that
sooner
or
later
he
would
have
to
ask
one
woman
or
another
but
he
belonged
to
miriam
of
that
she
was
so
fixedly
sure
that
he
allowed
her
right
chapter
x
clara
when
he
was
years
old
paul
sent
in
a
landscape
to
the
winter
exhibition
at
nottingham
castle
miss
jordan
had
taken
a
good
deal
of
interest
in
him
and
invited
him
to
her
house
where
he
met
other
artists
he
was
beginning
to
grow
ambitious
one
morning
the
postman
came
just
as
he
was
washing
in
the
scullery
suddenly
he
heard
a
wild
noise
from
his
mother
rushing
into
the
kitchen
he
found
her
standing
on
the
hearthrug
wildly
waving
a
letter
and
crying
hurrah
as
if
she
had
gone
mad
he
was
shocked
and
frightened
why
mother
he
exclaimed
she
flew
to
him
flung
her
arms
round
him
for
a
moment
then
waved
the
letter
crying
hurrah
my
boy
i
knew
we
should
do
it
he
was
afraid
of
her
the
small
severe
woman
with
graying
hair
suddenly
bursting
out
in
such
frenzy
the
postman
came
running
back
afraid
something
had
happened
they
saw
his
tipped
cap
over
the
short
curtains
morel
rushed
to
the
door
his
picture
got
first
prize
fred
she
cried
and
is
sold
for
twenty
my
word
that
something
like
said
the
young
postman
whom
they
had
known
all
his
life
and
major
moreton
has
bought
it
she
cried
it
looks
like
meanin
something
that
does
morel
said
the
postman
his
blue
eyes
bright
he
was
glad
to
have
brought
such
a
lucky
letter
morel
went
indoors
and
sat
down
trembling
paul
was
afraid
lest
she
might
have
misread
the
letter
and
might
be
disappointed
after
all
he
scrutinised
it
once
twice
yes
he
became
convinced
it
was
true
then
he
sat
down
his
heart
beating
with
joy
mother
he
exclaimed
did
i
say
we
should
do
it
she
said
pretending
she
was
not
crying
he
took
the
kettle
off
the
fire
and
mashed
the
tea
you
did
think
mother
he
began
tentatively
no
my
son
not
so
much
but
i
expected
a
good
but
not
so
much
he
said
no
no
but
i
knew
we
should
do
and
then
she
recovered
her
composure
apparently
at
least
he
sat
with
his
shirt
turned
back
showing
his
young
throat
almost
like
a
girl
and
the
towel
in
his
hand
his
hair
sticking
up
wet
twenty
guineas
mother
that
just
what
you
wanted
to
buy
arthur
out
now
you
need
borrow
any
it
just
indeed
i
sha
take
it
all
she
said
but
why
because
i
well
you
have
twelve
pounds
i
have
they
cavilled
about
sharing
the
twenty
guineas
she
wanted
to
take
only
the
five
pounds
she
needed
he
would
not
hear
of
it
so
they
got
over
the
stress
of
emotion
by
quarrelling
morel
came
home
at
night
from
the
pit
saying
they
tell
me
paul
got
first
prize
for
his
picture
and
sold
it
to
lord
henry
bentley
for
fifty
oh
what
stories
people
do
tell
she
cried
ha
he
answered
i
said
i
wor
sure
it
wor
a
lie
but
they
said
told
fred
as
if
i
would
tell
him
such
stuff
ha
assented
the
miner
but
he
was
disappointed
nevertheless
it
true
he
has
got
the
first
prize
said
morel
the
miner
sat
heavily
in
his
chair
has
he
beguy
he
exclaimed
he
stared
across
the
room
fixedly
but
as
for
fifty
pounds
such
nonsense
she
was
silent
awhile
major
moreton
bought
it
for
twenty
guineas
that
twenty
guineas
tha
niver
says
exclaimed
morel
yes
and
it
was
worth
ay
he
said
i
do
misdoubt
it
but
twenty
guineas
for
a
bit
of
a
paintin
as
he
knocked
off
in
an
hour
or
two
he
was
silent
with
conceit
of
his
son
morel
sniffed
as
if
it
were
nothing
and
when
does
he
handle
th
money
asked
the
collier
that
i
could
tell
you
when
the
picture
is
sent
home
i
there
was
silence
morel
stared
at
the
instead
of
eating
his
dinner
his
black
arm
with
the
hand
all
gnarled
with
work
lay
on
the
table
his
wife
pretended
not
to
see
him
rub
the
back
of
his
hand
across
his
eyes
nor
the
smear
in
the
on
his
black
face
yes
an
that
other
lad
done
as
much
if
they
hadna
ha
killed
he
said
quietly
the
thought
of
william
went
through
morel
like
a
cold
blade
it
left
her
feeling
she
was
tired
and
wanted
rest
paul
was
invited
to
dinner
at
jordan
afterwards
he
said
mother
i
want
an
evening
yes
i
was
afraid
you
would
she
said
she
was
glad
there
was
a
moment
or
two
of
silence
there
that
one
of
william
she
continued
that
i
know
cost
four
pounds
ten
and
which
he
only
worn
three
should
you
like
me
to
wear
it
mother
he
asked
yes
i
think
it
would
fit
you
at
least
the
coat
the
trousers
would
want
he
went
upstairs
and
put
on
the
coat
and
vest
coming
down
he
looked
strange
in
a
flannel
collar
and
a
flannel
with
an
evening
coat
and
vest
it
was
rather
large
the
tailor
can
make
it
right
she
said
smoothing
her
hand
over
his
shoulder
it
beautiful
stuff
i
never
could
find
in
my
heart
to
let
your
father
wear
the
trousers
and
very
glad
i
am
and
as
she
smoothed
her
hand
over
the
silk
collar
she
thought
of
her
eldest
son
but
this
son
was
living
enough
inside
the
clothes
she
passed
her
hand
down
his
back
to
feel
him
he
was
alive
and
hers
the
other
was
dead
he
went
out
to
dinner
several
times
in
his
evening
suit
that
had
been
william
each
time
his
mother
heart
was
firm
with
pride
and
joy
he
was
started
now
the
studs
she
and
the
children
had
bought
for
william
were
in
his
he
wore
one
of
william
dress
shirts
but
he
had
an
elegant
figure
his
face
was
rough
but
and
rather
pleasing
he
did
not
look
particularly
a
gentleman
but
she
thought
he
looked
quite
a
man
he
told
her
everything
that
took
place
everything
that
was
said
it
was
as
if
she
had
been
there
and
he
was
dying
to
introduce
her
to
these
new
friends
who
had
dinner
at
in
the
evening
go
along
with
you
she
said
what
do
they
want
to
know
me
for
they
do
he
cried
indignantly
if
they
want
to
know
me
and
they
say
they
do
then
they
want
to
know
you
because
you
are
quite
as
clever
as
i
go
along
with
you
child
she
laughed
but
she
began
to
spare
her
hands
they
too
were
now
the
skin
was
shiny
with
so
much
hot
water
the
knuckles
rather
swollen
but
she
began
to
be
careful
to
keep
them
out
of
soda
she
regretted
what
they
had
been
so
small
and
exquisite
and
when
annie
insisted
on
her
having
more
stylish
blouses
to
suit
her
age
she
submitted
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
allow
a
black
velvet
bow
to
be
placed
on
her
hair
then
she
sniffed
in
her
sarcastic
manner
and
was
sure
she
looked
a
sight
but
she
looked
a
lady
paul
declared
as
much
as
major
moreton
and
far
far
nicer
the
family
was
coming
on
only
morel
remained
unchanged
or
rather
lapsed
slowly
paul
and
his
mother
now
had
long
discussions
about
life
religion
was
fading
into
the
background
he
had
shovelled
away
all
the
beliefs
that
would
hamper
him
had
cleared
the
ground
and
come
more
or
less
to
the
bedrock
of
belief
that
one
should
feel
inside
oneself
for
right
and
wrong
and
should
have
the
patience
to
gradually
realise
one
god
now
life
interested
him
more
you
know
he
said
to
his
mother
i
do
want
to
belong
to
the
middle
class
i
like
my
common
people
best
i
belong
to
the
common
but
if
anyone
else
said
so
my
son
would
you
be
in
a
tear
you
know
you
consider
yourself
equal
to
any
in
myself
he
answered
not
in
my
class
or
my
education
or
my
manners
but
in
myself
i
very
well
then
then
why
talk
about
the
common
people
because
the
difference
between
people
is
in
their
class
but
in
themselves
only
from
the
middle
classes
one
gets
ideas
and
from
the
common
people
life
itself
warmth
you
feel
their
hates
and
it
all
very
well
my
boy
but
then
why
do
you
go
and
talk
to
your
father
pals
but
they
rather
not
at
all
they
the
common
people
after
all
whom
do
you
mix
with
now
among
the
common
people
those
that
exchange
ideas
like
the
middle
classes
the
rest
do
interest
but
there
the
life
i
do
believe
there
a
jot
more
life
from
miriam
than
you
could
get
from
any
educated
girl
say
miss
moreton
it
is
you
who
are
snobbish
about
she
frankly
wanted
him
to
climb
into
the
middle
classes
a
thing
not
very
difficult
she
knew
and
she
wanted
him
in
the
end
to
marry
a
lady
now
she
began
to
combat
him
in
his
restless
fretting
he
still
kept
up
his
connection
with
miriam
could
neither
break
free
nor
go
the
whole
length
of
engagement
and
this
indecision
seemed
to
bleed
him
of
his
energy
moreover
his
mother
suspected
him
of
an
unrecognised
leaning
towards
clara
and
since
the
latter
was
a
married
woman
she
wished
he
would
fall
in
love
with
one
of
the
girls
in
a
better
station
of
life
but
he
was
stupid
and
would
refuse
to
love
or
even
to
admire
a
girl
much
just
because
she
was
his
social
superior
my
boy
said
his
mother
to
him
all
your
cleverness
your
breaking
away
from
old
things
and
taking
life
in
your
own
hands
does
seem
to
bring
you
much
what
is
happiness
he
cried
it
nothing
to
me
how
am
i
to
be
happy
the
plump
question
disturbed
her
that
for
you
to
judge
my
lad
but
if
you
could
meet
some
good
woman
who
would
make
you
happy
and
you
began
to
think
of
settling
your
life
when
you
have
the
means
so
that
you
could
work
without
all
this
fretting
it
would
be
much
better
for
he
frowned
his
mother
caught
him
on
the
raw
of
his
wound
of
miriam
he
pushed
the
tumbled
hair
off
his
forehead
his
eyes
full
of
pain
and
fire
you
mean
easy
mother
he
cried
that
a
woman
whole
doctrine
for
life
ease
of
soul
and
physical
comfort
and
i
do
despise
oh
do
you
replied
his
mother
and
do
you
call
yours
a
divine
discontent
yes
i
do
care
about
its
divinity
but
damn
your
happiness
so
long
as
life
full
it
does
matter
whether
it
happy
or
not
i
afraid
your
happiness
would
bore
you
never
give
it
a
chance
she
said
then
suddenly
all
her
passion
of
grief
over
him
broke
out
but
it
does
matter
she
cried
and
you
ought
to
be
happy
you
ought
to
try
to
be
happy
to
live
to
be
happy
how
could
i
bear
to
think
your
life
would
be
a
happy
one
your
own
been
bad
enough
mater
but
it
has
left
you
so
much
worse
off
than
the
folk
who
been
happier
i
reckon
you
done
well
and
i
am
the
same
are
i
well
enough
off
you
not
my
son
battle
battle
and
suffer
it
about
all
you
do
as
far
as
i
can
but
why
not
my
dear
i
tell
you
it
the
best
it
is
and
one
ought
to
be
happy
one
by
this
time
morel
was
trembling
violently
struggles
of
this
kind
often
took
place
between
her
and
her
son
when
she
seemed
to
fight
for
his
very
life
against
his
own
will
to
die
he
took
her
in
his
arms
she
was
ill
and
pitiful
never
mind
little
he
murmured
so
long
as
you
do
feel
paltry
and
a
miserable
business
the
rest
does
matter
happiness
or
she
pressed
him
to
her
but
i
want
you
to
be
happy
she
said
pathetically
eh
my
dear
say
rather
you
want
me
to
morel
felt
as
if
her
heart
would
break
for
him
at
this
rate
she
knew
he
would
not
live
he
had
that
poignant
carelessness
about
himself
his
own
suffering
his
own
life
which
is
a
form
of
slow
suicide
it
almost
broke
her
heart
with
all
the
passion
of
her
strong
nature
she
hated
miriam
for
having
in
this
subtle
way
undermined
his
joy
it
did
not
matter
to
her
that
miriam
could
not
help
it
miriam
did
it
and
she
hated
her
she
wished
so
much
he
would
fall
in
love
with
a
girl
equal
to
be
his
mate
educated
and
strong
but
he
would
not
look
at
anybody
above
him
in
station
he
seemed
to
like
dawes
at
any
rate
that
feeling
was
wholesome
his
mother
prayed
and
prayed
for
him
that
he
might
not
be
wasted
that
was
all
her
prayer
not
for
his
soul
or
his
righteousness
but
that
he
might
not
be
wasted
and
while
he
slept
for
hours
and
hours
she
thought
and
prayed
for
him
he
drifted
away
from
miriam
imperceptibly
without
knowing
he
was
going
arthur
only
left
the
army
to
be
married
the
baby
was
born
six
months
after
his
wedding
morel
got
him
a
job
under
the
firm
again
at
shillings
a
week
she
furnished
for
him
with
the
help
of
beatrice
mother
a
little
cottage
of
two
rooms
he
was
caught
now
it
did
not
matter
how
he
kicked
and
struggled
he
was
fast
for
a
time
he
chafed
was
irritable
with
his
young
wife
who
loved
him
he
went
almost
distracted
when
the
baby
which
was
delicate
cried
or
gave
trouble
he
grumbled
for
hours
to
his
mother
she
only
said
well
my
lad
you
did
it
yourself
now
you
must
make
the
best
of
and
then
the
grit
came
out
in
him
he
buckled
to
work
undertook
his
responsibilities
acknowledged
that
he
belonged
to
his
wife
and
child
and
did
make
a
good
best
of
it
he
had
never
been
very
closely
inbound
into
the
family
now
he
was
gone
altogether
the
months
went
slowly
along
paul
had
more
or
less
got
into
connection
with
the
socialist
suffragette
unitarian
people
in
nottingham
owing
to
his
acquaintance
with
clara
one
day
a
friend
of
his
and
of
clara
in
bestwood
asked
him
to
take
a
message
to
dawes
he
went
in
the
evening
across
sneinton
market
to
bluebell
hill
he
found
the
house
in
a
mean
little
street
paved
with
granite
cobbles
and
having
causeways
of
dark
blue
grooved
bricks
the
front
door
went
up
a
step
from
off
this
rough
pavement
where
the
feet
of
the
passersby
rasped
and
clattered
the
brown
paint
on
the
door
was
so
old
that
the
naked
wood
showed
between
the
rents
he
stood
on
the
street
below
and
knocked
there
came
a
heavy
footstep
a
large
stout
woman
of
about
sixty
towered
above
him
he
looked
up
at
her
from
the
pavement
she
had
a
rather
severe
face
she
admitted
him
into
the
parlour
which
opened
on
to
the
street
it
was
a
small
stuffy
defunct
room
of
mahogany
and
deathly
enlargements
of
photographs
of
departed
people
done
in
carbon
radford
left
him
she
was
stately
almost
martial
in
a
moment
clara
appeared
she
flushed
deeply
and
he
was
covered
with
confusion
it
seemed
as
if
she
did
not
like
being
discovered
in
her
home
circumstances
i
thought
it
could
be
your
voice
she
said
but
she
might
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
for
a
lamb
she
invited
him
out
of
the
mausoleum
of
a
parlour
into
the
kitchen
that
was
a
little
darkish
room
too
but
it
was
smothered
in
white
lace
the
mother
had
seated
herself
again
by
the
cupboard
and
was
drawing
thread
from
a
vast
web
of
lace
a
clump
of
fluff
and
ravelled
cotton
was
at
her
right
hand
a
heap
of
lace
lay
on
her
left
whilst
in
front
of
her
was
the
mountain
of
lace
web
piling
the
hearthrug
threads
of
curly
cotton
pulled
out
from
between
the
lengths
of
lace
strewed
over
the
fender
and
the
fireplace
paul
dared
not
go
forward
for
fear
of
treading
on
piles
of
white
stuff
on
the
table
was
a
jenny
for
carding
the
lace
there
was
a
pack
of
brown
cardboard
squares
a
pack
of
cards
of
lace
a
little
box
of
pins
and
on
the
sofa
lay
a
heap
of
drawn
lace
the
room
was
all
lace
and
it
was
so
dark
and
warm
that
the
white
snowy
stuff
seemed
the
more
distinct
if
you
coming
in
you
wo
have
to
mind
the
work
said
radford
i
know
we
about
blocked
up
but
sit
you
clara
much
embarrassed
gave
him
a
chair
against
the
wall
opposite
the
white
heaps
then
she
herself
took
her
place
on
the
sofa
shamedly
will
you
drink
a
bottle
of
stout
radford
asked
clara
get
him
a
bottle
of
he
protested
but
radford
insisted
you
look
as
if
you
could
do
with
it
she
said
have
you
never
any
more
colour
than
that
it
only
a
thick
skin
i
got
that
does
show
the
blood
through
he
answered
clara
ashamed
and
chagrined
brought
him
a
bottle
of
stout
and
a
glass
he
poured
out
some
of
the
black
stuff
well
he
said
lifting
the
glass
here
health
and
thank
you
said
radford
he
took
a
drink
of
stout
and
light
yourself
a
cigarette
so
long
as
you
do
set
the
house
on
fire
said
radford
thank
you
he
replied
nay
you
need
thank
me
she
answered
i
s
be
glad
to
smell
a
bit
of
smoke
in
th
again
a
house
o
women
is
as
dead
as
a
house
wi
no
fire
to
my
thinkin
i
not
a
spider
as
likes
a
corner
to
myself
i
like
a
man
about
if
he
only
something
to
snap
clara
began
to
work
her
jenny
spun
with
a
subdued
buzz
the
white
lace
hopped
from
between
her
fingers
on
to
the
card
it
was
filled
she
snipped
off
the
length
and
pinned
the
end
down
to
the
banded
lace
then
she
put
a
new
card
in
her
jenny
paul
watched
her
she
sat
square
and
magnificent
her
throat
and
arms
were
bare
the
blood
still
mantled
below
her
ears
she
bent
her
head
in
shame
of
her
humility
her
face
was
set
on
her
work
her
arms
were
creamy
and
full
of
life
beside
the
white
lace
her
large
hands
worked
with
a
balanced
movement
as
if
nothing
would
hurry
them
he
not
knowing
watched
her
all
the
time
he
saw
the
arch
of
her
neck
from
the
shoulder
as
she
bent
her
head
he
saw
the
coil
of
dun
hair
he
watched
her
moving
gleaming
arms
i
heard
a
bit
about
you
from
clara
continued
the
mother
in
jordan
are
you
she
drew
her
lace
unceasing
ay
well
and
i
can
remember
when
thomas
jordan
used
to
ask
me
for
one
of
my
did
he
laughed
paul
and
did
he
get
it
sometimes
he
did
sometimes
he
did
which
was
latterly
for
he
the
sort
that
takes
all
and
gives
naught
he
is
or
used
to
i
think
he
very
decent
said
paul
yes
well
i
glad
to
hear
radford
looked
across
at
him
steadily
there
was
something
determined
about
her
that
he
liked
her
face
was
falling
loose
but
her
eyes
were
calm
and
there
was
something
strong
in
her
that
made
it
seem
she
was
not
old
merely
her
wrinkles
and
loose
cheeks
were
an
anachronism
she
had
the
strength
and
of
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
life
she
continued
drawing
the
lace
with
slow
dignified
movements
the
big
web
came
up
inevitably
over
her
apron
the
length
of
lace
fell
away
at
her
side
her
arms
were
finely
shapen
but
glossy
and
yellow
as
old
ivory
they
had
not
the
peculiar
dull
gleam
that
made
clara
so
fascinating
to
him
and
you
been
going
with
miriam
leivers
the
mother
asked
him
well
he
answered
yes
she
a
nice
girl
she
continued
she
very
nice
but
she
a
bit
too
much
above
this
world
to
suit
my
she
is
a
bit
like
that
he
agreed
she
never
be
satisfied
till
she
got
wings
and
can
fly
over
everybody
head
she
wo
she
said
clara
broke
in
and
he
told
her
his
message
she
spoke
humbly
to
him
he
had
surprised
her
in
her
drudgery
to
have
her
humble
made
him
feel
as
if
he
were
lifting
his
head
in
expectation
do
you
like
jennying
he
asked
what
can
a
woman
do
she
replied
bitterly
is
it
sweated
more
or
less
is
all
woman
work
that
another
trick
the
men
have
played
since
we
force
ourselves
into
the
labour
now
then
you
shut
up
about
the
men
said
her
mother
if
the
women
was
fools
the
men
would
be
bad
uns
that
what
i
say
no
man
was
ever
that
bad
wi
me
but
what
he
got
it
back
again
not
but
what
a
lousy
lot
there
no
denying
but
they
all
right
really
are
they
he
asked
well
they
a
bit
different
from
women
she
answered
would
you
care
to
be
back
at
jordan
he
asked
clara
i
do
think
so
she
replied
yes
she
would
cried
her
mother
thank
her
stars
if
she
could
get
back
do
you
listen
to
her
she
for
ever
on
that
horse
of
hers
an
it
back
that
thin
an
starved
it
cut
her
in
two
one
of
these
clara
suffered
badly
from
her
mother
paul
felt
as
if
his
eyes
were
coming
very
wide
open
was
he
to
take
clara
fulminations
so
seriously
after
all
she
spun
steadily
at
her
work
he
experienced
a
thrill
of
joy
thinking
she
might
need
his
help
she
seemed
denied
and
deprived
of
so
much
and
her
arm
moved
mechanically
that
should
never
have
been
subdued
to
a
mechanism
and
her
head
was
bowed
to
the
lace
that
never
should
have
been
bowed
she
seemed
to
be
stranded
there
among
the
refuse
that
life
has
thrown
away
doing
her
jennying
it
was
a
bitter
thing
to
her
to
be
put
aside
by
life
as
if
it
had
no
use
for
her
no
wonder
she
protested
she
came
with
him
to
the
door
he
stood
below
in
the
mean
street
looking
up
at
her
so
fine
she
was
in
her
stature
and
her
bearing
she
reminded
him
of
juno
dethroned
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
she
winced
from
the
street
from
her
surroundings
and
you
will
go
with
hodgkisson
to
hucknall
he
was
talking
quite
meaninglessly
only
watching
her
her
grey
eyes
at
last
met
his
they
looked
dumb
with
humiliation
pleading
with
a
kind
of
captive
misery
he
was
shaken
and
at
a
loss
he
had
thought
her
high
and
mighty
when
he
left
her
he
wanted
to
run
he
went
to
the
station
in
a
sort
of
dream
and
was
at
home
without
realising
he
had
moved
out
of
her
street
he
had
an
idea
that
susan
the
overseer
of
the
spiral
girls
was
about
to
be
married
he
asked
her
the
next
day
i
say
susan
i
heard
a
whisper
of
your
getting
married
what
about
it
susan
flushed
red
who
been
talking
to
you
she
replied
nobody
i
merely
heard
a
whisper
that
you
were
thinking
well
i
am
though
you
need
tell
anybody
what
more
i
wish
i
was
nay
susan
you
wo
make
me
believe
sha
i
you
can
believe
it
though
i
rather
stop
here
a
thousand
paul
was
perturbed
why
susan
the
girl
colour
was
high
and
her
eyes
flashed
that
why
and
must
you
for
answer
she
looked
at
him
there
was
about
him
a
candour
and
gentleness
which
made
the
women
trust
him
he
understood
ah
i
sorry
he
said
tears
came
to
her
eyes
but
you
see
it
turn
out
all
right
you
make
the
best
of
it
he
continued
rather
wistfully
there
nothing
else
for
yea
there
making
the
worst
of
it
try
and
make
it
all
he
soon
made
occasion
to
call
again
on
clara
would
you
he
said
care
to
come
back
to
jordan
she
put
down
her
work
laid
her
beautiful
arms
on
the
table
and
looked
at
him
for
some
moments
without
answering
gradually
the
flush
mounted
her
cheek
why
she
asked
paul
felt
rather
awkward
well
because
susan
is
thinking
of
leaving
he
said
clara
went
on
with
her
jennying
the
white
lace
leaped
in
little
jumps
and
bounds
on
to
the
card
he
waited
for
her
without
raising
her
head
she
said
at
last
in
a
peculiar
low
voice
have
you
said
anything
about
it
except
to
you
not
a
there
was
again
a
long
silence
i
will
apply
when
the
advertisement
is
out
she
said
you
will
apply
before
that
i
will
let
you
know
exactly
she
went
on
spinning
her
little
machine
and
did
not
contradict
him
clara
came
to
jordan
some
of
the
older
hands
fanny
among
them
remembered
her
earlier
rule
and
cordially
disliked
the
memory
clara
had
always
been
ikey
reserved
and
superior
she
had
never
mixed
with
the
girls
as
one
of
themselves
if
she
had
occasion
to
find
fault
she
did
it
coolly
and
with
perfect
politeness
which
the
defaulter
felt
to
be
a
bigger
insult
than
crassness
towards
fanny
the
poor
overstrung
hunchback
clara
was
unfailingly
compassionate
and
gentle
as
a
result
of
which
fanny
shed
more
bitter
tears
than
ever
the
rough
tongues
of
the
other
overseers
had
caused
her
there
was
something
in
clara
that
paul
disliked
and
much
that
piqued
him
if
she
were
about
he
always
watched
her
strong
throat
or
her
neck
upon
which
the
blonde
hair
grew
low
and
fluffy
there
was
a
fine
down
almost
invisible
upon
the
skin
of
her
face
and
arms
and
when
once
he
had
perceived
it
he
saw
it
always
when
he
was
at
his
work
painting
in
the
afternoon
she
would
come
and
stand
near
to
him
perfectly
motionless
then
he
felt
her
though
she
neither
spoke
nor
touched
him
although
she
stood
a
yard
away
he
felt
as
if
he
were
in
contact
with
her
then
he
could
paint
no
more
he
flung
down
the
brushes
and
turned
to
talk
to
her
sometimes
she
praised
his
work
sometimes
she
was
critical
and
cold
you
are
affected
in
that
piece
she
would
say
and
as
there
was
an
element
of
truth
in
her
condemnation
his
blood
boiled
with
anger
again
what
of
this
he
would
ask
enthusiastically
h
she
made
a
small
doubtful
sound
it
does
interest
me
because
you
do
understand
it
he
retorted
then
why
ask
me
about
it
because
i
thought
you
would
she
would
shrug
her
shoulders
in
scorn
of
his
work
she
maddened
him
he
was
furious
then
he
abused
her
and
went
into
passionate
exposition
of
his
stuff
this
amused
and
stimulated
her
but
she
never
owned
that
she
had
been
wrong
during
the
ten
years
that
she
had
belonged
to
the
women
movement
she
had
acquired
a
fair
amount
of
education
and
having
had
some
of
miriam
passion
to
be
instructed
had
taught
herself
french
and
could
read
in
that
language
with
a
struggle
she
considered
herself
as
a
woman
apart
and
particularly
apart
from
her
class
the
girls
in
the
spiral
department
were
all
of
good
homes
it
was
a
small
special
industry
and
had
a
certain
distinction
there
was
an
air
of
refinement
in
both
rooms
but
clara
was
aloof
also
from
her
none
of
these
things
however
did
she
reveal
to
paul
she
was
not
the
one
to
give
herself
away
there
was
a
sense
of
mystery
about
her
she
was
so
reserved
he
felt
she
had
much
to
reserve
her
history
was
open
on
the
surface
but
its
inner
meaning
was
hidden
from
everybody
it
was
exciting
and
then
sometimes
he
caught
her
looking
at
him
from
under
her
brows
with
an
almost
furtive
sullen
scrutiny
which
made
him
move
quickly
often
she
met
his
eyes
but
then
her
own
were
as
it
were
covered
over
revealing
nothing
she
gave
him
a
little
lenient
smile
she
was
to
him
extraordinarily
provocative
because
of
the
knowledge
she
seemed
to
possess
and
gathered
fruit
of
experience
he
could
not
attain
one
day
he
picked
up
a
copy
of
de
mon
from
her
you
read
french
do
you
he
cried
clara
glanced
round
negligently
she
was
making
an
elastic
stocking
of
heliotrope
silk
turning
the
spiral
machine
with
slow
balanced
regularity
occasionally
bending
down
to
see
her
work
or
to
adjust
the
needles
then
her
magnificent
neck
with
its
down
and
fine
pencils
of
hair
shone
white
against
the
lavender
lustrous
silk
she
turned
a
few
more
rounds
and
stopped
what
did
you
say
she
asked
smiling
sweetly
paul
eyes
glittered
at
her
insolent
indifference
to
him
i
did
not
know
you
read
french
he
said
very
polite
did
you
not
she
replied
with
a
faint
sarcastic
smile
rotten
swank
he
said
but
scarcely
loud
enough
to
be
heard
he
shut
his
mouth
angrily
as
he
watched
her
she
seemed
to
scorn
the
work
she
mechanically
produced
yet
the
hose
she
made
were
as
nearly
perfect
as
possible
you
do
like
spiral
work
he
said
oh
well
all
work
is
work
she
answered
as
if
she
knew
all
about
it
he
marvelled
at
her
coldness
he
had
to
do
everything
hotly
she
must
be
something
special
what
would
you
prefer
to
do
he
asked
she
laughed
at
him
indulgently
as
she
said
there
is
so
little
likelihood
of
my
ever
being
given
a
choice
that
i
have
wasted
time
pah
he
said
contemptuous
on
his
side
now
you
only
say
that
because
you
too
proud
to
own
up
what
you
want
and
ca
you
know
me
very
well
she
replied
coldly
i
know
you
think
you
terrific
great
shakes
and
that
you
live
under
the
eternal
insult
of
working
in
a
he
was
very
angry
and
very
rude
she
merely
turned
away
from
him
in
disdain
he
walked
whistling
down
the
room
flirted
and
laughed
with
hilda
later
on
he
said
to
himself
what
was
i
so
impudent
to
clara
for
he
was
rather
annoyed
with
himself
at
the
same
time
glad
serve
her
right
she
stinks
with
silent
pride
he
said
to
himself
angrily
in
the
afternoon
he
came
down
there
was
a
certain
weight
on
his
heart
which
he
wanted
to
remove
he
thought
to
do
it
by
offering
her
chocolates
have
one
he
said
i
bought
a
handful
to
sweeten
me
to
his
great
relief
she
accepted
he
sat
on
the
beside
her
machine
twisting
a
piece
of
silk
round
his
finger
she
loved
him
for
his
quick
unexpected
movements
like
a
young
animal
his
feet
swung
as
he
pondered
the
sweets
lay
strewn
on
the
bench
she
bent
over
her
machine
grinding
rhythmically
then
stooping
to
see
the
stocking
that
hung
beneath
pulled
down
by
the
weight
he
watched
the
handsome
crouching
of
her
back
and
the
curling
on
the
floor
there
is
always
about
you
he
said
a
sort
of
waiting
whatever
i
see
you
doing
you
not
really
there
you
are
waiting
like
penelope
when
she
did
her
he
could
not
help
a
spurt
of
wickedness
call
you
penelope
he
said
would
it
make
any
difference
she
said
carefully
removing
one
of
her
needles
that
does
matter
so
long
as
it
pleases
me
here
i
say
you
seem
to
forget
i
your
boss
it
just
occurs
to
and
what
does
that
mean
she
asked
coolly
it
means
i
got
a
right
to
boss
is
there
anything
you
want
to
complain
about
oh
i
say
you
need
be
nasty
he
said
angrily
i
do
know
what
you
want
she
said
continuing
her
task
i
want
you
to
treat
me
nicely
and
call
you
perhaps
she
asked
quietly
yes
call
me
i
should
love
then
i
wish
you
would
go
upstairs
his
mouth
closed
and
a
frown
came
on
his
face
he
jumped
suddenly
down
you
too
blessed
superior
for
anything
he
said
and
he
went
away
to
the
other
girls
he
felt
he
was
being
angrier
than
he
had
any
need
to
be
in
fact
he
doubted
slightly
that
he
was
showing
off
but
if
he
were
then
he
would
clara
heard
him
laughing
in
a
way
she
hated
with
the
girls
down
the
next
room
when
at
evening
he
went
through
the
department
after
the
girls
had
gone
he
saw
his
chocolates
lying
untouched
in
front
of
clara
machine
he
left
them
in
the
morning
they
were
still
there
and
clara
was
at
work
later
on
minnie
a
little
brunette
they
called
pussy
called
to
him
hey
have
you
got
a
chocolate
for
anybody
sorry
pussy
he
replied
i
meant
to
have
offered
them
then
i
went
and
forgot
i
think
you
did
she
answered
i
bring
you
some
this
afternoon
you
do
want
them
after
been
lying
about
do
you
oh
i
not
particular
smiled
pussy
oh
no
he
said
they
be
he
went
up
to
clara
bench
sorry
i
left
these
things
littering
about
he
said
she
flushed
scarlet
he
gathered
them
together
in
his
fist
they
be
dirty
now
he
said
you
should
have
taken
them
i
wonder
why
you
did
i
meant
to
have
told
you
i
wanted
you
he
flung
them
out
of
the
window
into
the
yard
below
he
just
glanced
at
her
she
winced
from
his
eyes
in
the
afternoon
he
brought
another
packet
will
you
take
some
he
said
offering
them
first
to
clara
these
are
she
accepted
one
and
put
it
on
to
the
bench
oh
take
several
for
luck
he
said
she
took
a
couple
more
and
put
them
on
the
bench
also
then
she
turned
in
confusion
to
her
work
he
went
on
up
the
room
here
you
are
pussy
he
said
do
be
greedy
are
they
all
for
her
cried
the
others
rushing
up
of
course
they
not
he
said
the
girls
clamoured
round
pussy
drew
back
from
her
mates
come
out
she
cried
i
can
have
first
pick
ca
i
paul
be
nice
with
he
said
and
went
away
you
are
a
dear
the
girls
cried
tenpence
he
answered
he
went
past
clara
without
speaking
she
felt
the
three
chocolate
creams
would
burn
her
if
she
touched
them
it
needed
all
her
courage
to
slip
them
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
the
girls
loved
him
and
were
afraid
of
him
he
was
so
nice
while
he
was
nice
but
if
he
were
offended
so
distant
treating
them
as
if
they
scarcely
existed
or
not
more
than
the
bobbins
of
thread
and
then
if
they
were
impudent
he
said
quietly
do
you
mind
going
on
with
your
work
and
stood
and
watched
when
he
celebrated
his
birthday
the
house
was
in
trouble
arthur
was
just
going
to
be
married
his
mother
was
not
well
his
father
getting
an
old
man
and
lame
from
his
accidents
was
given
a
paltry
poor
job
miriam
was
an
eternal
reproach
he
felt
he
owed
himself
to
her
yet
could
not
give
himself
the
house
moreover
needed
his
support
he
was
pulled
in
all
directions
he
was
not
glad
it
was
his
birthday
it
made
him
bitter
he
got
to
work
at
eight
most
of
the
clerks
had
not
turned
up
the
girls
were
not
due
till
as
he
was
changing
his
coat
he
heard
a
voice
behind
him
say
paul
paul
i
want
it
was
fanny
the
hunchback
standing
at
the
top
of
her
stairs
her
face
radiant
with
a
secret
paul
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
i
want
you
she
said
he
stood
at
a
loss
come
on
she
coaxed
come
before
you
begin
on
the
he
went
down
the
steps
into
her
dry
narrow
room
fanny
walked
before
him
her
black
bodice
was
short
the
waist
was
under
her
armpits
and
her
cashmere
skirt
seemed
very
long
as
she
strode
with
big
strides
before
the
young
man
himself
so
graceful
she
went
to
her
seat
at
the
narrow
end
of
the
room
where
the
window
opened
on
to
paul
watched
her
thin
hands
and
her
flat
red
wrists
as
she
excitedly
twitched
her
white
apron
which
was
spread
on
the
bench
in
front
of
her
she
hesitated
you
did
think
we
forgot
you
she
asked
reproachful
why
he
asked
he
had
forgotten
his
birthday
himself
he
says
why
look
here
she
pointed
to
the
calendar
and
he
saw
surrounding
the
big
black
number
hundreds
of
little
crosses
in
oh
kisses
for
my
birthday
he
laughed
how
did
you
know
yes
you
want
to
know
do
you
fanny
mocked
hugely
delighted
there
one
from
everybody
except
lady
clara
and
two
from
some
but
i
sha
tell
you
how
many
i
oh
i
know
you
spooney
he
said
there
you
are
mistaken
she
cried
indignant
i
could
never
be
so
her
voice
was
strong
and
contralto
you
always
pretend
to
be
such
a
hussy
he
laughed
and
you
know
you
as
sentimental
i
rather
be
called
sentimental
than
frozen
meat
fanny
blurted
paul
knew
she
referred
to
clara
and
he
smiled
do
you
say
such
nasty
things
about
me
he
laughed
no
my
duck
the
hunchback
woman
answered
lavishly
tender
she
was
no
my
duck
because
you
do
think
yourself
a
fine
figure
in
marble
and
us
nothing
but
dirt
i
as
good
as
you
are
i
paul
and
the
question
delighted
her
why
we
not
better
than
one
another
are
we
he
replied
but
i
as
good
as
you
are
i
paul
she
persisted
daringly
of
course
you
are
if
it
comes
to
goodness
you
she
was
rather
afraid
of
the
situation
she
might
get
hysterical
i
thought
i
get
here
before
the
others
wo
they
say
i
deep
now
shut
your
eyes
she
said
and
open
your
mouth
and
see
what
god
sends
you
he
continued
suiting
action
to
words
and
expecting
a
piece
of
chocolate
he
heard
the
rustle
of
the
apron
and
a
faint
clink
of
metal
i
going
to
look
he
said
he
opened
his
eyes
fanny
her
long
cheeks
flushed
her
blue
eyes
shining
was
gazing
at
him
there
was
a
little
bundle
of
on
the
bench
before
him
he
turned
pale
no
fanny
he
said
quickly
from
us
all
she
answered
hastily
no
but
are
they
the
right
sort
she
asked
rocking
herself
with
delight
jove
they
the
best
in
the
but
they
the
right
sorts
she
cried
they
off
the
little
list
i
made
to
get
when
my
ship
came
he
bit
his
lip
fanny
was
overcome
with
emotion
she
must
turn
the
conversation
they
was
all
on
thorns
to
do
it
they
all
paid
their
shares
all
except
the
queen
of
the
queen
of
sheba
was
clara
and
would
she
join
paul
asked
she
did
get
the
chance
we
never
told
her
we
was
going
to
have
her
bossing
this
show
we
did
want
her
to
paul
laughed
at
the
woman
he
was
much
moved
at
last
he
must
go
she
was
very
close
to
him
suddenly
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
kissed
him
vehemently
i
can
give
you
a
kiss
she
said
apologetically
you
looked
so
white
it
made
my
heart
paul
kissed
her
and
left
her
her
arms
were
so
pitifully
thin
that
his
heart
ached
also
that
day
he
met
clara
as
he
ran
downstairs
to
wash
his
hands
at
you
have
stayed
to
dinner
he
exclaimed
it
was
unusual
for
her
yes
and
i
seem
to
have
dined
on
old
stock
i
must
go
out
now
or
i
shall
feel
stale
right
she
lingered
he
instantly
caught
at
her
wish
you
are
going
anywhere
he
asked
they
went
together
up
to
the
castle
outdoors
she
dressed
very
plainly
down
to
ugliness
indoors
she
always
looked
nice
she
walked
with
hesitating
steps
alongside
paul
bowing
and
turning
away
from
him
dowdy
in
dress
and
drooping
she
showed
to
great
disadvantage
he
could
scarcely
recognise
her
strong
form
that
seemed
to
slumber
with
power
she
appeared
almost
insignificant
drowning
her
stature
in
her
stoop
as
she
shrank
from
the
public
gaze
the
castle
grounds
were
very
green
and
fresh
climbing
the
precipitous
ascent
he
laughed
and
chattered
but
she
was
silent
seeming
to
brood
over
something
there
was
scarcely
time
to
go
inside
the
squat
square
building
that
crowns
the
bluff
of
rock
they
leaned
upon
the
wall
where
the
cliff
runs
sheer
down
to
the
park
below
them
in
their
holes
in
the
sandstone
pigeons
preened
themselves
and
cooed
softly
away
down
upon
the
boulevard
at
the
foot
of
the
rock
tiny
trees
stood
in
their
own
pools
of
shadow
and
tiny
people
went
scurrying
about
in
almost
ludicrous
importance
you
feel
as
if
you
could
scoop
up
the
folk
like
tadpoles
and
have
a
handful
of
them
he
said
she
laughed
answering
yes
it
is
not
necessary
to
get
far
off
in
order
to
see
us
proportionately
the
trees
are
much
more
bulk
only
he
said
she
laughed
cynically
away
beyond
the
boulevard
the
thin
stripes
of
the
metals
showed
upon
the
whose
margin
was
crowded
with
little
stacks
of
timber
beside
which
smoking
toy
engines
fussed
then
the
silver
string
of
the
canal
lay
at
random
among
the
black
heaps
beyond
the
dwellings
very
dense
on
the
river
flat
looked
like
black
poisonous
herbage
in
thick
rows
and
crowded
beds
stretching
right
away
broken
now
and
then
by
taller
plants
right
to
where
the
river
glistened
in
a
hieroglyph
across
the
country
the
steep
scarp
cliffs
across
the
river
looked
puny
great
stretches
of
country
darkened
with
trees
and
faintly
brightened
with
spread
towards
the
haze
where
the
hills
rose
blue
beyond
grey
it
is
comforting
said
dawes
to
think
the
town
goes
no
farther
it
is
only
a
little
sore
upon
the
country
a
little
scab
paul
said
she
shivered
she
loathed
the
town
looking
drearily
across
at
the
country
which
was
forbidden
her
her
impassive
face
pale
and
hostile
she
reminded
paul
of
one
of
the
bitter
remorseful
angels
but
the
town
all
right
he
said
it
only
temporary
this
is
the
crude
clumsy
we
practised
on
till
we
find
out
what
the
idea
is
the
town
will
come
all
the
pigeons
in
the
pockets
of
rock
among
the
perched
bushes
cooed
comfortably
to
the
left
the
large
church
of
mary
rose
into
space
to
keep
close
company
with
the
castle
above
the
heaped
rubble
of
the
town
dawes
smiled
brightly
as
she
looked
across
the
country
i
feel
better
she
said
thank
you
he
replied
great
compliment
oh
my
brother
she
laughed
h
that
snatching
back
with
the
left
hand
what
you
gave
with
the
right
and
no
mistake
he
said
she
laughed
in
amusement
at
him
but
what
was
the
matter
with
you
he
asked
i
know
you
were
brooding
something
special
i
can
see
the
stamp
of
it
on
your
face
i
think
i
will
not
tell
you
she
said
all
right
hug
it
he
answered
she
flushed
and
bit
her
lip
no
she
said
it
was
the
what
about
paul
asked
they
have
been
plotting
something
for
a
week
now
and
they
seem
particularly
full
of
it
all
alike
they
insult
me
with
their
do
they
he
asked
in
concern
i
should
not
mind
she
went
on
in
the
metallic
angry
tone
if
they
did
not
thrust
it
into
my
face
the
fact
that
they
have
a
just
like
women
said
he
it
is
hateful
their
mean
gloating
she
said
intensely
paul
was
silent
he
knew
what
the
girls
gloated
over
he
was
sorry
to
be
the
cause
of
this
new
dissension
they
can
have
all
the
secrets
in
the
world
she
went
on
brooding
bitterly
but
they
might
refrain
from
glorying
in
them
and
making
me
feel
more
out
of
it
than
ever
it
is
it
is
almost
paul
thought
for
a
few
minutes
he
was
much
perturbed
i
will
tell
you
what
it
all
about
he
said
pale
and
nervous
my
birthday
and
they
bought
me
a
fine
lot
of
paints
all
the
girls
they
jealous
of
you
he
felt
her
stiffen
coldly
at
the
word
merely
because
i
sometimes
bring
you
a
book
he
added
slowly
but
you
see
it
only
a
trifle
do
bother
about
it
will
you
because
he
laughed
quickly
well
what
would
they
say
if
they
saw
us
here
now
in
spite
of
their
victory
she
was
angry
with
him
for
his
clumsy
reference
to
their
present
intimacy
it
was
almost
insolent
of
him
yet
he
was
so
quiet
she
forgave
him
although
it
cost
her
an
effort
their
two
hands
lay
on
the
rough
stone
parapet
of
the
castle
wall
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
a
fineness
of
mould
so
that
his
hands
were
small
and
vigorous
hers
were
large
to
match
her
large
limbs
but
white
and
powerful
looking
as
paul
looked
at
them
he
knew
her
she
is
wanting
somebody
to
take
her
hands
for
all
she
is
so
contemptuous
of
us
he
said
to
himself
and
she
saw
nothing
but
his
two
hands
so
warm
and
alive
which
seemed
to
live
for
her
he
was
brooding
now
staring
out
over
the
country
from
under
sullen
brows
the
little
interesting
diversity
of
shapes
had
vanished
from
the
scene
all
that
remained
was
a
vast
dark
matrix
of
sorrow
and
tragedy
the
same
in
all
the
houses
and
the
and
the
people
and
the
birds
they
were
only
shapen
differently
and
now
that
the
forms
seemed
to
have
melted
away
there
remained
the
mass
from
which
all
the
landscape
was
composed
a
dark
mass
of
struggle
and
pain
the
factory
the
girls
his
mother
the
large
uplifted
church
the
thicket
of
the
town
merged
into
one
atmosphere
dark
brooding
and
sorrowful
every
bit
is
that
two
striking
dawes
said
in
surprise
paul
started
and
everything
sprang
into
form
regained
its
individuality
its
forgetfulness
and
its
cheerfulness
they
hurried
back
to
work
when
he
was
in
the
rush
of
preparing
for
the
night
post
examining
the
work
up
from
fanny
room
which
smelt
of
ironing
the
evening
postman
came
in
paul
morel
he
said
smiling
handing
paul
a
package
a
handwriting
do
let
the
girls
see
the
postman
himself
a
favourite
was
pleased
to
make
fun
of
the
affection
for
paul
it
was
a
volume
of
verse
with
a
brief
note
you
will
allow
me
to
send
you
this
and
so
spare
me
my
isolation
i
also
sympathise
and
wish
you
paul
flushed
hot
good
lord
dawes
she
ca
afford
it
good
lord
who
ever
have
thought
it
he
was
suddenly
intensely
moved
he
was
filled
with
the
warmth
of
her
in
the
glow
he
could
almost
feel
her
as
if
she
were
present
her
arms
her
shoulders
her
bosom
see
them
feel
them
almost
contain
them
this
move
on
the
part
of
clara
brought
them
into
closer
intimacy
the
other
girls
noticed
that
when
paul
met
dawes
his
eyes
lifted
and
gave
that
peculiar
bright
greeting
which
they
could
interpret
knowing
he
was
unaware
clara
made
no
sign
save
that
occasionally
she
turned
aside
her
face
from
him
when
he
came
upon
her
they
walked
out
together
very
often
at
it
was
quite
open
quite
frank
everybody
seemed
to
feel
that
he
was
quite
unaware
of
the
state
of
his
own
feeling
and
that
nothing
was
wrong
he
talked
to
her
now
with
some
of
the
old
fervour
with
which
he
had
talked
to
miriam
but
he
cared
less
about
the
talk
he
did
not
bother
about
his
conclusions
one
day
in
october
they
went
out
to
lambley
for
tea
suddenly
they
came
to
a
halt
on
top
of
the
hill
he
climbed
and
sat
on
a
gate
she
sat
on
the
stile
the
afternoon
was
perfectly
still
with
a
dim
haze
and
yellow
sheaves
glowing
through
they
were
quiet
how
old
were
you
when
you
married
he
asked
quietly
her
voice
was
subdued
almost
submissive
she
would
tell
him
now
it
is
eight
years
ago
and
when
did
you
leave
him
three
years
five
years
did
you
love
him
when
you
married
him
she
was
silent
for
some
time
then
she
said
slowly
i
thought
i
did
more
or
less
i
did
think
much
about
it
and
he
wanted
me
i
was
very
prudish
and
you
sort
of
walked
into
it
without
thinking
yes
i
seemed
to
have
been
asleep
nearly
all
my
but
when
did
you
wake
up
i
do
know
that
i
ever
did
or
ever
have
since
i
was
a
you
went
to
sleep
as
you
grew
to
be
a
woman
how
queer
and
he
wake
you
no
he
never
got
there
she
replied
in
a
monotone
the
brown
birds
dashed
over
the
hedges
where
the
stood
naked
and
scarlet
got
where
he
asked
at
me
he
never
really
mattered
to
the
afternoon
was
so
gently
warm
and
dim
red
roofs
of
the
cottages
burned
among
the
blue
haze
he
loved
the
day
he
could
feel
but
he
could
not
understand
what
clara
was
saying
but
why
did
you
leave
him
was
he
horrid
to
you
she
shuddered
lightly
he
he
sort
of
degraded
me
he
wanted
to
bully
me
because
he
got
me
and
then
i
felt
as
if
i
wanted
to
run
as
if
i
was
fastened
and
bound
up
and
he
seemed
i
he
did
not
at
all
see
and
was
he
always
dirty
he
asked
a
bit
she
replied
slowly
and
then
he
seemed
as
if
he
could
get
at
me
really
and
then
he
got
brutal
he
was
brutal
and
why
did
you
leave
him
finally
because
because
he
was
unfaithful
to
me
they
were
both
silent
for
some
time
her
hand
lay
on
the
as
she
balanced
he
put
his
own
over
it
his
heart
beat
quickly
but
did
you
were
you
ever
did
you
ever
give
him
a
chance
chance
how
to
come
near
to
i
married
him
and
i
was
willing
they
both
strove
to
keep
their
voices
steady
i
believe
he
loves
you
he
said
it
looks
like
it
she
replied
he
wanted
to
take
his
hand
away
and
could
not
she
saved
him
by
removing
her
own
after
a
silence
he
began
again
did
you
leave
him
out
of
count
all
along
he
left
me
she
said
and
i
suppose
he
could
make
himself
mean
everything
to
you
he
tried
to
bully
me
into
but
the
conversation
had
got
them
both
out
of
their
depth
suddenly
paul
jumped
down
come
on
he
said
let
go
and
get
some
they
found
a
cottage
where
they
sat
in
the
cold
parlour
she
poured
out
his
tea
she
was
very
quiet
he
felt
she
had
withdrawn
again
from
him
after
tea
she
stared
broodingly
into
her
twisting
her
wedding
ring
all
the
time
in
her
abstraction
she
took
the
ring
off
her
finger
stood
it
up
and
spun
it
upon
the
table
the
gold
became
a
diaphanous
glittering
globe
it
fell
and
the
ring
was
quivering
upon
the
table
she
spun
it
again
and
again
paul
watched
fascinated
but
she
was
a
married
woman
and
he
believed
in
simple
friendship
and
he
considered
that
he
was
perfectly
honourable
with
regard
to
her
it
was
only
a
friendship
between
man
and
woman
such
as
any
civilised
persons
might
have
he
was
like
so
many
young
men
of
his
own
age
sex
had
become
so
complicated
in
him
that
he
would
have
denied
that
he
ever
could
want
clara
or
miriam
or
any
woman
whom
he
knew
sex
desire
was
a
sort
of
detached
thing
that
did
not
belong
to
a
woman
he
loved
miriam
with
his
soul
he
grew
warm
at
the
thought
of
clara
he
battled
with
her
he
knew
the
curves
of
her
breast
and
shoulders
as
if
they
had
been
moulded
inside
him
and
yet
he
did
not
positively
desire
her
he
would
have
denied
it
for
ever
he
believed
himself
really
bound
to
miriam
if
ever
he
should
marry
some
time
in
the
far
future
it
would
be
his
duty
to
marry
miriam
that
he
gave
clara
to
understand
and
she
said
nothing
but
left
him
to
his
courses
he
came
to
her
dawes
whenever
he
could
then
he
wrote
frequently
to
miriam
and
visited
the
girl
occasionally
so
he
went
on
through
the
winter
but
he
seemed
not
so
fretted
his
mother
was
easier
about
him
she
thought
he
was
getting
away
from
miriam
miriam
knew
now
how
strong
was
the
attraction
of
clara
for
him
but
still
she
was
certain
that
the
best
in
him
would
triumph
his
feeling
for
dawes
who
moreover
was
a
married
woman
was
shallow
and
temporal
compared
with
his
love
for
herself
he
would
come
back
to
her
she
was
sure
with
some
of
his
young
freshness
gone
perhaps
but
cured
of
his
desire
for
the
lesser
things
which
other
women
than
herself
could
give
him
she
could
bear
all
if
he
were
inwardly
true
to
her
and
must
come
back
he
saw
none
of
the
anomaly
of
his
position
miriam
was
his
old
friend
lover
and
she
belonged
to
bestwood
and
home
and
his
youth
clara
was
a
newer
friend
and
she
belonged
to
nottingham
to
life
to
the
world
it
seemed
to
him
quite
plain
dawes
and
he
had
many
periods
of
coolness
when
they
saw
little
of
each
other
but
they
always
came
together
again
were
you
horrid
with
baxter
dawes
he
asked
her
it
was
a
thing
that
seemed
to
trouble
him
in
what
way
oh
i
do
know
but
were
you
horrid
with
him
did
you
do
something
that
knocked
him
to
pieces
what
pray
making
him
feel
as
if
he
were
nothing
i
know
paul
declared
you
are
so
clever
my
friend
she
said
coolly
the
conversation
broke
off
there
but
it
made
her
cool
with
him
for
some
time
she
very
rarely
saw
miriam
now
the
friendship
between
the
two
women
was
not
broken
off
but
considerably
weakened
will
you
come
in
to
the
concert
on
sunday
afternoon
clara
asked
him
just
after
christmas
i
promised
to
go
up
to
willey
farm
he
replied
oh
very
you
do
mind
do
you
he
asked
why
should
i
she
answered
which
almost
annoyed
him
you
know
he
said
miriam
and
i
have
been
a
lot
to
each
other
ever
since
i
was
sixteen
that
seven
years
it
a
long
time
clara
replied
yes
but
somehow
she
it
does
go
right
how
asked
clara
she
seems
to
draw
me
and
draw
me
and
she
would
leave
a
single
hair
of
me
free
to
fall
out
and
blow
away
she
keep
but
you
like
to
be
no
he
said
i
do
i
wish
it
could
be
normal
give
and
take
like
me
and
you
i
want
a
woman
to
keep
me
but
not
in
her
but
if
you
love
her
it
could
be
normal
like
me
and
yes
i
should
love
her
better
then
she
sort
of
wants
me
so
much
that
i
ca
give
wants
you
how
wants
the
soul
out
of
my
body
i
ca
help
shrinking
back
from
and
yet
you
love
her
no
i
do
love
her
i
never
even
kiss
why
not
clara
asked
i
do
i
suppose
you
afraid
she
said
i
not
something
in
me
shrinks
from
her
like
hell
she
so
good
when
i
not
how
do
you
know
what
she
is
i
do
i
know
she
wants
a
sort
of
soul
but
how
do
you
know
what
she
wants
i
been
with
her
for
seven
and
you
have
found
out
the
very
first
thing
about
what
that
that
she
does
want
any
of
your
soul
communion
that
your
own
imagination
she
wants
he
pondered
over
this
perhaps
he
was
wrong
but
she
seems
he
began
you
never
tried
she
answered
chapter
xi
the
test
on
miriam
with
the
spring
came
again
the
old
madness
and
battle
now
he
knew
he
would
have
to
go
to
miriam
but
what
was
his
reluctance
he
told
himself
it
was
only
a
sort
of
overstrong
virginity
in
her
and
him
which
neither
could
break
through
he
might
have
married
her
but
his
circumstances
at
home
made
it
difficult
and
moreover
he
did
not
want
to
marry
marriage
was
for
life
and
because
they
had
become
close
companions
he
and
she
he
did
not
see
that
it
should
inevitably
follow
they
should
be
man
and
wife
he
did
not
feel
that
he
wanted
marriage
with
miriam
he
wished
he
did
he
would
have
given
his
head
to
have
felt
a
joyous
desire
to
marry
her
and
to
have
her
then
why
could
he
bring
it
off
there
was
some
obstacle
and
what
was
the
obstacle
it
lay
in
the
physical
bondage
he
shrank
from
the
physical
contact
but
why
with
her
he
felt
bound
up
inside
himself
he
could
not
go
out
to
her
something
struggled
in
him
but
he
could
not
get
to
her
why
she
loved
him
clara
said
she
even
wanted
him
then
why
could
he
go
to
her
make
love
to
her
kiss
her
why
when
she
put
her
arm
in
his
timidly
as
they
walked
did
he
feel
he
would
burst
forth
in
brutality
and
recoil
he
owed
himself
to
her
he
wanted
to
belong
to
her
perhaps
the
recoil
and
the
shrinking
from
her
was
love
in
its
first
fierce
modesty
he
had
no
aversion
for
her
no
it
was
the
opposite
it
was
a
strong
desire
battling
with
a
still
stronger
shyness
and
virginity
it
seemed
as
if
virginity
were
a
positive
force
which
fought
and
won
in
both
of
them
and
with
her
he
felt
it
so
hard
to
overcome
yet
he
was
nearest
to
her
and
with
her
alone
could
he
deliberately
break
through
and
he
owed
himself
to
her
then
if
they
could
get
things
right
they
could
marry
but
he
would
not
marry
unless
he
could
feel
strong
in
the
joy
of
it
never
he
could
not
have
faced
his
mother
it
seemed
to
him
that
to
sacrifice
himself
in
a
marriage
he
did
not
want
would
be
degrading
and
would
undo
all
his
life
make
it
a
nullity
he
would
try
what
he
could
do
and
he
had
a
great
tenderness
for
miriam
always
she
was
sad
dreaming
her
religion
and
he
was
nearly
a
religion
to
her
he
could
not
bear
to
fail
her
it
would
all
come
right
if
they
tried
he
looked
round
a
good
many
of
the
nicest
men
he
knew
were
like
himself
bound
in
by
their
own
virginity
which
they
could
not
break
out
of
they
were
so
sensitive
to
their
women
that
they
would
go
without
them
for
ever
rather
than
do
them
a
hurt
an
injustice
being
the
sons
of
mothers
whose
husbands
had
blundered
rather
brutally
through
their
feminine
sanctities
they
were
themselves
too
diffident
and
shy
they
could
easier
deny
themselves
than
incur
any
reproach
from
a
woman
for
a
woman
was
like
their
mother
and
they
were
full
of
the
sense
of
their
mother
they
preferred
themselves
to
suffer
the
misery
of
celibacy
rather
than
risk
the
other
person
he
went
back
to
her
something
in
her
when
he
looked
at
her
brought
the
tears
almost
to
his
eyes
one
day
he
stood
behind
her
as
she
sang
annie
was
playing
a
song
on
the
piano
as
miriam
sang
her
mouth
seemed
hopeless
she
sang
like
a
nun
singing
to
heaven
it
reminded
him
so
much
of
the
mouth
and
eyes
of
one
who
sings
beside
a
botticelli
madonna
so
spiritual
again
hot
as
steel
came
up
the
pain
in
him
why
must
he
ask
her
for
the
other
thing
why
was
there
his
blood
battling
with
her
if
only
he
could
have
been
always
gentle
tender
with
her
breathing
with
her
the
atmosphere
of
reverie
and
religious
dreams
he
would
give
his
right
hand
it
was
not
fair
to
hurt
her
there
seemed
an
eternal
maidenhood
about
her
and
when
he
thought
of
her
mother
he
saw
the
great
brown
eyes
of
a
maiden
who
was
nearly
scared
and
shocked
out
of
her
virgin
maidenhood
but
not
quite
in
spite
of
her
seven
children
they
had
been
born
almost
leaving
her
out
of
count
not
of
her
but
upon
her
so
she
could
never
let
them
go
because
she
never
had
possessed
them
morel
saw
him
going
again
frequently
to
miriam
and
was
astonished
he
said
nothing
to
his
mother
he
did
not
explain
nor
excuse
himself
if
he
came
home
late
and
she
reproached
him
he
frowned
and
turned
on
her
in
an
overbearing
way
i
shall
come
home
when
i
like
he
said
i
am
old
must
she
keep
you
till
this
time
it
is
i
who
stay
he
answered
and
she
lets
you
but
very
well
she
said
and
she
went
to
bed
leaving
the
door
unlocked
for
him
but
she
lay
listening
until
he
came
often
long
after
it
was
a
great
bitterness
to
her
that
he
had
gone
back
to
miriam
she
recognised
however
the
uselessness
of
any
further
interference
he
went
to
willey
farm
as
a
man
now
not
as
a
youth
she
had
no
right
over
him
there
was
a
coldness
between
him
and
her
he
hardly
told
her
anything
discarded
she
waited
on
him
cooked
for
him
still
and
loved
to
slave
for
him
but
her
face
closed
again
like
a
mask
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
now
but
the
housework
for
all
the
rest
he
had
gone
to
miriam
she
could
not
forgive
him
miriam
killed
the
joy
and
the
warmth
in
him
he
had
been
such
a
jolly
lad
and
full
of
the
warmest
affection
now
he
grew
colder
more
and
more
irritable
and
gloomy
it
reminded
her
of
william
but
paul
was
worse
he
did
things
with
more
intensity
and
more
realisation
of
what
he
was
about
his
mother
knew
how
he
was
suffering
for
want
of
a
woman
and
she
saw
him
going
to
miriam
if
he
had
made
up
his
mind
nothing
on
earth
would
alter
him
morel
was
tired
she
began
to
give
up
at
last
she
had
finished
she
was
in
the
way
he
went
on
determinedly
he
realised
more
or
less
what
his
mother
felt
it
only
hardened
his
soul
he
made
himself
callous
towards
her
but
it
was
like
being
callous
to
his
own
health
it
undermined
him
quickly
yet
he
persisted
he
lay
back
in
the
at
willey
farm
one
evening
he
had
been
talking
to
miriam
for
some
weeks
but
had
not
come
to
the
point
now
he
said
suddenly
i
am
she
had
been
brooding
she
looked
up
at
him
suddenly
in
surprise
yes
what
makes
you
say
it
there
was
something
in
the
charged
atmosphere
that
she
dreaded
sir
thomas
more
says
one
can
marry
at
she
laughed
quaintly
saying
does
it
need
sir
thomas
more
sanction
no
but
one
ought
to
marry
about
ay
she
answered
broodingly
and
she
waited
i
ca
marry
you
he
continued
slowly
not
now
because
we
no
money
and
they
depend
on
me
at
she
sat
what
was
coming
but
i
want
to
marry
now
you
want
to
marry
she
repeated
a
woman
you
know
what
i
she
was
silent
now
at
last
i
must
he
said
ay
she
answered
and
you
love
me
she
laughed
bitterly
why
are
you
ashamed
of
it
he
answered
you
would
be
ashamed
before
your
god
why
are
you
before
people
nay
she
answered
deeply
i
am
not
you
are
he
replied
bitterly
and
it
my
fault
but
you
know
i
help
being
as
i
am
do
you
i
know
you
ca
help
it
she
replied
i
love
you
an
awful
lot
then
there
is
something
where
she
answered
looking
at
him
oh
in
me
it
is
i
who
ought
to
be
ashamed
like
a
spiritual
cripple
and
i
am
ashamed
it
is
misery
why
is
it
i
do
know
replied
miriam
and
i
do
know
he
repeated
do
you
think
we
have
been
too
fierce
in
our
what
they
call
purity
do
you
think
that
to
be
so
much
afraid
and
averse
is
a
sort
of
dirtiness
she
looked
at
him
with
startled
dark
eyes
you
recoiled
away
from
anything
of
the
sort
and
i
took
the
motion
from
you
and
recoiled
also
perhaps
there
was
silence
in
the
room
for
some
time
yes
she
said
it
is
there
is
between
us
he
said
all
these
years
of
intimacy
i
feel
naked
enough
before
you
do
you
understand
i
think
so
she
answered
and
you
love
me
she
laughed
do
be
bitter
he
pleaded
she
looked
at
him
and
was
sorry
for
him
his
eyes
were
dark
with
torture
she
was
sorry
for
him
it
was
worse
for
him
to
have
this
deflated
love
than
for
herself
who
could
never
be
properly
mated
he
was
restless
for
ever
urging
forward
and
trying
to
find
a
way
out
he
might
do
as
he
liked
and
have
what
he
liked
of
her
nay
she
said
softly
i
am
not
she
felt
she
could
bear
anything
for
him
she
would
suffer
for
him
she
put
her
hand
on
his
knee
as
he
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
he
took
it
and
kissed
it
but
it
hurt
to
do
so
he
felt
he
was
putting
himself
aside
he
sat
there
sacrificed
to
her
purity
which
felt
more
like
nullity
how
could
he
kiss
her
hand
passionately
when
it
would
drive
her
away
and
leave
nothing
but
pain
yet
slowly
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
they
knew
each
other
too
well
to
pretend
anything
as
she
kissed
him
she
watched
his
eyes
they
were
staring
across
the
room
with
a
peculiar
dark
blaze
in
them
that
fascinated
her
he
was
perfectly
still
she
could
feel
his
heart
throbbing
heavily
in
his
breast
what
are
you
thinking
about
she
asked
the
blaze
in
his
eyes
shuddered
became
uncertain
i
was
thinking
all
the
while
i
love
you
i
have
been
she
sank
her
head
on
his
breast
yes
she
answered
that
all
he
said
and
his
voice
seemed
sure
and
his
mouth
was
kissing
her
throat
then
she
raised
her
head
and
looked
into
his
eyes
with
her
full
gaze
of
love
the
blaze
struggled
seemed
to
try
to
get
away
from
her
and
then
was
quenched
he
turned
his
head
quickly
aside
it
was
a
moment
of
anguish
kiss
me
she
whispered
he
shut
his
eyes
and
kissed
her
and
his
arms
folded
her
closer
and
closer
when
she
walked
home
with
him
over
the
fields
he
said
i
am
glad
i
came
back
to
you
i
feel
so
simple
with
you
as
if
there
was
nothing
to
hide
we
will
be
happy
yes
she
murmured
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
some
sort
of
perversity
in
our
souls
he
said
makes
us
not
want
get
away
from
the
very
thing
we
want
we
have
to
fight
against
yes
she
said
and
she
felt
stunned
as
she
stood
under
the
tree
in
the
darkness
by
the
roadside
he
kissed
her
and
his
fingers
wandered
over
her
face
in
the
darkness
where
he
could
not
see
her
but
only
feel
her
his
passion
flooded
him
he
clasped
her
very
close
sometime
you
will
have
me
he
murmured
hiding
his
face
on
her
shoulder
it
was
so
difficult
not
now
she
said
his
hopes
and
his
heart
sunk
a
dreariness
came
over
him
no
he
said
his
clasp
of
her
slackened
i
love
to
feel
your
arm
there
she
said
pressing
his
arm
against
her
back
where
it
went
round
her
waist
it
rests
me
he
tightened
the
pressure
of
his
arm
upon
the
small
of
her
back
to
rest
her
we
belong
to
each
other
he
said
then
why
should
we
belong
to
each
other
altogether
but
she
faltered
i
know
it
a
lot
to
ask
he
said
but
there
not
much
risk
for
you
really
not
in
the
gretchen
way
you
can
trust
me
there
oh
i
can
trust
the
answer
came
quick
and
strong
it
not
that
it
not
that
at
all
but
what
she
hid
her
face
in
his
neck
with
a
little
cry
of
misery
i
do
know
she
cried
she
seemed
slightly
hysterical
but
with
a
sort
of
horror
his
heart
died
in
him
you
do
think
it
ugly
he
asked
no
not
now
you
have
taught
me
it
you
are
afraid
she
calmed
herself
hastily
yes
i
am
only
afraid
she
said
he
kissed
her
tenderly
never
mind
he
said
you
should
please
suddenly
she
gripped
his
arms
round
her
and
clenched
her
body
stiff
you
shall
have
me
she
said
through
her
shut
teeth
his
heart
beat
up
again
like
fire
he
folded
her
close
and
his
mouth
was
on
her
throat
she
could
not
bear
it
she
drew
away
he
disengaged
her
wo
you
be
late
she
asked
gently
he
sighed
scarcely
hearing
what
she
said
she
waited
wishing
he
would
go
at
last
he
kissed
her
quickly
and
climbed
the
fence
looking
round
he
saw
the
pale
blotch
of
her
face
down
in
the
darkness
under
the
hanging
tree
there
was
no
more
of
her
but
this
pale
blotch
she
called
softly
she
had
no
body
only
a
voice
and
a
dim
face
he
turned
away
and
ran
down
the
road
his
fists
clenched
and
when
he
came
to
the
wall
over
the
lake
he
leaned
there
almost
stunned
looking
up
the
black
water
miriam
plunged
home
over
the
meadows
she
was
not
afraid
of
people
what
they
might
say
but
she
dreaded
the
issue
with
him
yes
she
would
let
him
have
her
if
he
insisted
and
then
when
she
thought
of
it
afterwards
her
heart
went
down
he
would
be
disappointed
he
would
find
no
satisfaction
and
then
he
would
go
away
yet
he
was
so
insistent
and
over
this
which
did
not
seem
so
to
her
was
their
love
to
break
down
after
all
he
was
only
like
other
men
seeking
his
satisfaction
oh
but
there
was
something
more
in
him
something
deeper
she
could
trust
to
it
in
spite
of
all
desires
he
said
that
possession
was
a
great
moment
in
life
all
strong
emotions
concentrated
there
perhaps
it
was
so
there
was
something
divine
in
it
then
she
would
submit
religiously
to
the
sacrifice
he
should
have
her
and
at
the
thought
her
whole
body
clenched
itself
involuntarily
hard
as
if
against
something
but
life
forced
her
through
this
gate
of
suffering
too
and
she
would
submit
at
any
rate
it
would
give
him
what
he
wanted
which
was
her
deepest
wish
she
brooded
and
brooded
and
brooded
herself
towards
accepting
him
he
courted
her
now
like
a
lover
often
when
he
grew
hot
she
put
his
face
from
her
held
it
between
her
hands
and
looked
in
his
eyes
he
could
not
meet
her
gaze
her
dark
eyes
full
of
love
earnest
and
searching
made
him
turn
away
not
for
an
instant
would
she
let
him
forget
back
again
he
had
to
torture
himself
into
a
sense
of
his
responsibility
and
hers
never
any
relaxing
never
any
leaving
himself
to
the
great
hunger
and
impersonality
of
passion
he
must
be
brought
back
to
a
deliberate
reflective
creature
as
if
from
a
swoon
of
passion
she
caged
him
back
to
the
littleness
the
personal
relationship
he
could
not
bear
it
leave
me
alone
leave
me
alone
he
wanted
to
cry
but
she
wanted
him
to
look
at
her
with
eyes
full
of
love
his
eyes
full
of
the
dark
impersonal
fire
of
desire
did
not
belong
to
her
there
was
a
great
crop
of
cherries
at
the
farm
the
trees
at
the
back
of
the
house
very
large
and
tall
hung
thick
with
scarlet
and
crimson
drops
under
the
dark
leaves
paul
and
edgar
were
gathering
the
fruit
one
evening
it
had
been
a
hot
day
and
now
the
clouds
were
rolling
in
the
sky
dark
and
warm
paul
combed
high
in
the
tree
above
the
scarlet
roofs
of
the
buildings
the
wind
moaning
steadily
made
the
whole
tree
rock
with
a
subtle
thrilling
motion
that
stirred
the
blood
the
young
man
perched
insecurely
in
the
slender
branches
rocked
till
he
felt
slightly
drunk
reached
down
the
boughs
where
the
scarlet
beady
cherries
hung
thick
underneath
and
tore
off
handful
after
handful
of
the
sleek
fruit
cherries
touched
his
ears
and
his
neck
as
he
stretched
forward
their
chill
sending
a
flash
down
his
blood
all
shades
of
red
from
a
golden
vermilion
to
a
rich
crimson
glowed
and
met
his
eyes
under
a
darkness
of
leaves
the
sun
going
down
suddenly
caught
the
broken
clouds
immense
piles
of
gold
flared
out
in
the
heaped
in
soft
glowing
yellow
right
up
the
sky
the
world
till
now
dusk
and
grey
reflected
the
gold
glow
astonished
everywhere
the
trees
and
the
grass
and
the
water
seemed
roused
from
the
twilight
and
shining
miriam
came
out
wondering
oh
paul
heard
her
mellow
voice
call
is
it
wonderful
he
looked
down
there
was
a
faint
gold
glimmer
on
her
face
that
looked
very
soft
turned
up
to
him
how
high
you
are
she
said
beside
her
on
the
rhubarb
leaves
were
four
dead
birds
thieves
that
had
been
shot
paul
saw
some
cherry
stones
hanging
quite
bleached
like
skeletons
picked
clear
of
flesh
he
looked
down
again
to
miriam
clouds
are
on
fire
he
said
beautiful
she
cried
she
seemed
so
small
so
soft
so
tender
down
there
he
threw
a
handful
of
cherries
at
her
she
was
startled
and
frightened
he
laughed
with
a
low
chuckling
sound
and
pelted
her
she
ran
for
shelter
picking
up
some
cherries
two
fine
red
pairs
she
hung
over
her
ears
then
she
looked
up
again
have
you
got
enough
she
asked
nearly
it
is
like
being
on
a
ship
up
and
how
long
will
you
stay
while
the
sunset
she
went
to
the
fence
and
sat
there
watching
the
gold
clouds
fall
to
pieces
and
go
in
immense
ruin
towards
the
darkness
gold
flamed
to
scarlet
like
pain
in
its
intense
brightness
then
the
scarlet
sank
to
rose
and
rose
to
crimson
and
quickly
the
passion
went
out
of
the
sky
all
the
world
was
dark
grey
paul
scrambled
quickly
down
with
his
basket
tearing
his
as
he
did
so
they
are
lovely
said
miriam
fingering
the
cherries
i
torn
my
sleeve
he
answered
she
took
the
rip
saying
i
shall
have
to
mend
it
was
near
the
shoulder
she
put
her
fingers
through
the
tear
how
warm
she
said
he
laughed
there
was
a
new
strange
note
in
his
voice
one
that
made
her
pant
shall
we
stay
out
he
said
wo
it
rain
she
asked
no
let
us
walk
a
little
they
went
down
the
fields
and
into
the
thick
plantation
of
trees
and
pines
shall
we
go
in
among
the
trees
he
asked
do
you
want
to
it
was
very
dark
among
the
firs
and
the
sharp
spines
pricked
her
face
she
was
afraid
paul
was
silent
and
strange
i
like
the
darkness
he
said
i
wish
it
were
thicker
good
thick
he
seemed
to
be
almost
unaware
of
her
as
a
person
she
was
only
to
him
then
a
woman
she
was
afraid
he
stood
against
a
trunk
and
took
her
in
his
arms
she
relinquished
herself
to
him
but
it
was
a
sacrifice
in
which
she
felt
something
of
horror
this
oblivious
man
was
a
stranger
to
her
later
it
began
to
rain
the
smelled
very
strong
paul
lay
with
his
head
on
the
ground
on
the
dead
pine
needles
listening
to
the
sharp
hiss
of
the
rain
a
steady
keen
noise
his
heart
was
down
very
heavy
now
he
realised
that
she
had
not
been
with
him
all
the
time
that
her
soul
had
stood
apart
in
a
sort
of
horror
he
was
physically
at
rest
but
no
more
very
dreary
at
heart
very
sad
and
very
tender
his
fingers
wandered
over
her
face
pitifully
now
again
she
loved
him
deeply
he
was
tender
and
beautiful
the
rain
he
said
yes
is
it
coming
on
you
she
put
her
hands
over
him
on
his
hair
on
his
shoulders
to
feel
if
the
raindrops
fell
on
him
she
loved
him
dearly
he
as
he
lay
with
his
face
on
the
dead
felt
extraordinarily
quiet
he
did
not
mind
if
the
raindrops
came
on
him
he
would
have
lain
and
got
wet
through
he
felt
as
if
nothing
mattered
as
if
his
living
were
smeared
away
into
the
beyond
near
and
quite
lovable
this
strange
gentle
to
death
was
new
to
him
we
must
go
said
miriam
yes
he
answered
but
did
not
move
to
him
now
life
seemed
a
shadow
day
a
white
shadow
night
and
death
and
stillness
and
inaction
this
seemed
like
being
to
be
alive
to
be
urgent
and
insistent
that
was
the
highest
of
all
was
to
melt
out
into
the
darkness
and
sway
there
identified
with
the
great
being
the
rain
is
coming
in
on
us
said
miriam
he
rose
and
assisted
her
it
is
a
pity
he
said
what
to
have
to
go
i
feel
so
still
she
repeated
stiller
than
i
have
ever
been
in
my
he
was
walking
with
his
hand
in
hers
she
pressed
his
fingers
feeling
a
slight
fear
now
he
seemed
beyond
her
she
had
a
fear
lest
she
should
lose
him
the
are
like
presences
on
the
darkness
each
one
only
a
she
was
afraid
and
said
nothing
a
sort
of
hush
the
whole
night
wondering
and
asleep
i
suppose
what
we
do
in
death
sleep
in
she
had
been
afraid
before
of
the
brute
in
him
now
of
the
mystic
she
trod
beside
him
in
silence
the
rain
fell
with
a
heavy
hush
on
the
trees
at
last
they
gained
the
cartshed
let
us
stay
here
awhile
he
said
there
was
a
sound
of
rain
everywhere
smothering
everything
i
feel
so
strange
and
still
he
said
along
with
ay
she
answered
patiently
he
seemed
again
unaware
of
her
though
he
held
her
hand
close
to
be
rid
of
our
individuality
which
is
our
will
which
is
our
effort
to
live
effortless
a
kind
of
curious
sleep
that
is
very
beautiful
i
think
that
is
our
our
yes
yes
and
very
beautiful
to
you
do
usually
say
in
a
while
they
went
indoors
everybody
looked
at
them
curiously
he
still
kept
the
quiet
heavy
look
in
his
eyes
the
stillness
in
his
voice
instinctively
they
all
left
him
alone
about
this
time
miriam
grandmother
who
lived
in
a
tiny
cottage
in
woodlinton
fell
ill
and
the
girl
was
sent
to
keep
house
it
was
a
beautiful
little
place
the
cottage
had
a
big
garden
in
front
with
red
brick
walls
against
which
the
plum
trees
were
nailed
at
the
back
another
garden
was
separated
from
the
fields
by
a
tall
old
hedge
it
was
very
pretty
miriam
had
not
much
to
do
so
she
found
time
for
her
beloved
reading
and
for
writing
little
introspective
pieces
which
interested
her
at
the
her
grandmother
being
better
was
driven
to
derby
to
stay
with
her
daughter
for
a
day
or
two
she
was
a
crotchety
old
lady
and
might
return
the
second
day
or
the
third
so
miriam
stayed
alone
in
the
cottage
which
also
pleased
her
paul
used
often
to
cycle
over
and
they
had
as
a
rule
peaceful
and
happy
times
he
did
not
embarrass
her
much
but
then
on
the
monday
of
the
holiday
he
was
to
spend
a
whole
day
with
her
it
was
perfect
weather
he
left
his
mother
telling
her
where
he
was
going
she
would
be
alone
all
the
day
it
cast
a
shadow
over
him
but
he
had
three
days
that
were
all
his
own
when
he
was
going
to
do
as
he
liked
it
was
sweet
to
rush
through
the
morning
lanes
on
his
bicycle
he
got
to
the
cottage
at
about
eleven
miriam
was
busy
preparing
dinner
she
looked
so
perfectly
in
keeping
with
the
little
kitchen
ruddy
and
busy
he
kissed
her
and
sat
down
to
watch
the
room
was
small
and
cosy
the
sofa
was
covered
all
over
with
a
sort
of
linen
in
squares
of
red
and
pale
blue
old
much
washed
but
pretty
there
was
a
stuffed
owl
in
a
case
over
a
corner
cupboard
the
sunlight
came
through
the
leaves
of
the
scented
geraniums
in
the
window
she
was
cooking
a
chicken
in
his
honour
it
was
their
cottage
for
the
day
and
they
were
man
and
wife
he
beat
the
eggs
for
her
and
peeled
the
potatoes
he
thought
she
gave
a
feeling
of
home
almost
like
his
mother
and
no
one
could
look
more
beautiful
with
her
tumbled
curls
when
she
was
flushed
from
the
fire
the
dinner
was
a
great
success
like
a
young
husband
he
carved
they
talked
all
the
time
with
unflagging
zest
then
he
wiped
the
dishes
she
had
washed
and
they
went
out
down
the
fields
there
was
a
bright
little
brook
that
ran
into
a
bog
at
the
foot
of
a
very
steep
bank
here
they
wandered
picking
still
a
few
and
many
big
blue
then
she
sat
on
the
bank
with
her
hands
full
of
flowers
mostly
golden
as
she
put
her
face
down
into
the
marigolds
it
was
all
overcast
with
a
yellow
shine
your
face
is
bright
he
said
like
a
she
looked
at
him
questioning
he
laughed
pleadingly
to
her
laying
his
hands
on
hers
then
he
kissed
her
fingers
then
her
face
the
world
was
all
steeped
in
sunshine
and
quite
still
yet
not
asleep
but
quivering
with
a
kind
of
expectancy
i
have
never
seen
anything
more
beautiful
than
this
he
said
he
held
her
hand
fast
all
the
time
and
the
water
singing
to
itself
as
it
runs
do
you
love
it
she
looked
at
him
full
of
love
his
eyes
were
very
dark
very
bright
do
you
think
it
a
great
day
he
asked
she
murmured
her
assent
she
was
happy
and
he
saw
it
and
our
day
just
between
us
he
said
they
lingered
a
little
while
then
they
stood
up
upon
the
sweet
thyme
and
he
looked
down
at
her
simply
will
you
come
he
asked
they
went
back
to
the
house
hand
in
hand
in
silence
the
chickens
came
scampering
down
the
path
to
her
he
locked
the
door
and
they
had
the
little
house
to
themselves
he
never
forgot
seeing
her
as
she
lay
on
the
bed
when
he
was
unfastening
his
collar
first
he
saw
only
her
beauty
and
was
blind
with
it
she
had
the
most
beautiful
body
he
had
ever
imagined
he
stood
unable
to
move
or
speak
looking
at
her
his
face
with
wonder
and
then
he
wanted
her
but
as
he
went
forward
to
her
her
hands
lifted
in
a
little
pleading
movement
and
he
looked
at
her
face
and
stopped
her
big
brown
eyes
were
watching
him
still
and
resigned
and
loving
she
lay
as
if
she
had
given
herself
up
to
sacrifice
there
was
her
body
for
him
but
the
look
at
the
back
of
her
eyes
like
a
creature
awaiting
immolation
arrested
him
and
all
his
blood
fell
back
you
are
sure
you
want
me
he
asked
as
if
a
cold
shadow
had
come
over
him
yes
quite
she
was
very
quiet
very
calm
she
only
realised
that
she
was
doing
something
for
him
he
could
hardly
bear
it
she
lay
to
be
sacrificed
for
him
because
she
loved
him
so
much
and
he
had
to
sacrifice
her
for
a
second
he
wished
he
were
sexless
or
dead
then
he
shut
his
eyes
again
to
her
and
his
blood
beat
back
again
and
afterwards
he
loved
her
loved
her
to
the
last
fibre
of
his
being
he
loved
her
but
he
wanted
somehow
to
cry
there
was
something
he
could
not
bear
for
her
sake
he
stayed
with
her
till
quite
late
at
night
as
he
rode
home
he
felt
that
he
was
finally
initiated
he
was
a
youth
no
longer
but
why
had
he
the
dull
pain
in
his
soul
why
did
the
thought
of
death
the
seem
so
sweet
and
consoling
he
spent
the
week
with
miriam
and
wore
her
out
with
his
passion
before
it
was
gone
he
had
always
almost
wilfully
to
put
her
out
of
count
and
act
from
the
brute
strength
of
his
own
feelings
and
he
could
not
do
it
often
and
there
remained
afterwards
always
the
sense
of
failure
and
of
death
if
he
were
really
with
her
he
had
to
put
aside
himself
and
his
desire
if
he
would
have
her
he
had
to
put
her
aside
when
i
come
to
you
he
asked
her
his
eyes
dark
with
pain
and
shame
you
do
really
want
me
do
you
ah
yes
she
replied
quickly
he
looked
at
her
nay
he
said
she
began
to
tremble
you
see
she
said
taking
his
face
and
shutting
it
out
against
her
shoulder
you
see
as
we
are
how
can
i
get
used
to
you
it
would
come
all
right
if
we
were
he
lifted
her
head
and
looked
at
her
you
mean
now
it
is
always
too
much
shock
yes
and
you
are
always
clenched
against
she
was
trembling
with
agitation
you
see
she
said
i
not
used
to
the
thought
you
are
lately
he
said
but
all
my
life
mother
said
to
me
is
one
thing
in
marriage
that
is
always
dreadful
but
you
have
to
bear
it
and
i
believed
and
still
believe
it
he
said
no
she
cried
hastily
i
believe
as
you
do
that
loving
even
in
that
way
is
the
mark
of
that
does
alter
the
fact
that
you
never
want
no
she
said
taking
his
head
in
her
arms
and
rocking
in
despair
do
say
so
you
do
she
rocked
with
pain
do
i
want
your
children
but
not
how
can
you
say
so
but
we
must
be
married
to
have
children
shall
we
be
married
then
i
want
you
to
have
my
he
kissed
her
hand
reverently
she
pondered
sadly
watching
him
we
are
too
young
she
said
at
length
and
not
yet
she
pleaded
as
she
rocked
herself
in
distress
when
you
will
he
said
she
bowed
her
head
gravely
the
tone
of
hopelessness
in
which
he
said
these
things
grieved
her
deeply
it
had
always
been
a
failure
between
them
tacitly
she
acquiesced
in
what
he
felt
and
after
a
week
of
love
he
said
to
his
mother
suddenly
one
sunday
night
just
as
they
were
going
to
bed
i
sha
go
so
much
to
miriam
she
was
surprised
but
she
would
not
ask
him
anything
you
please
yourself
she
said
so
he
went
to
bed
but
there
was
a
new
quietness
about
him
which
she
had
wondered
at
she
almost
guessed
she
would
leave
him
alone
however
precipitation
might
spoil
things
she
watched
him
in
his
loneliness
wondering
where
he
would
end
he
was
sick
and
much
too
quiet
for
him
there
was
a
perpetual
little
knitting
of
his
brows
such
as
she
had
seen
when
he
was
a
small
baby
and
which
had
been
gone
for
many
years
now
it
was
the
same
again
and
she
could
do
nothing
for
him
he
had
to
go
on
alone
make
his
own
way
he
continued
faithful
to
miriam
for
one
day
he
had
loved
her
utterly
but
it
never
came
again
the
sense
of
failure
grew
stronger
at
first
it
was
only
a
sadness
then
he
began
to
feel
he
could
not
go
on
he
wanted
to
run
to
go
abroad
anything
gradually
he
ceased
to
ask
her
to
have
him
instead
of
drawing
them
together
it
put
them
apart
and
then
he
realised
consciously
that
it
was
no
good
it
was
useless
trying
it
would
never
be
a
success
between
them
for
some
months
he
had
seen
very
little
of
clara
they
had
occasionally
walked
out
for
half
an
hour
at
but
he
always
reserved
himself
for
miriam
with
clara
however
his
brow
cleared
and
he
was
gay
again
she
treated
him
indulgently
as
if
he
were
a
child
he
thought
he
did
not
mind
but
deep
below
the
surface
it
piqued
him
sometimes
miriam
said
what
about
clara
i
hear
nothing
of
her
i
walked
with
her
about
twenty
minutes
yesterday
he
replied
and
what
did
she
talk
about
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
did
all
the
jawing
i
usually
do
i
think
i
was
telling
her
about
the
strike
and
how
the
women
took
so
he
gave
the
account
of
himself
but
insidiously
without
his
knowing
it
the
warmth
he
felt
for
clara
drew
him
away
from
miriam
for
whom
he
felt
responsible
and
to
whom
he
felt
he
belonged
he
thought
he
was
being
quite
faithful
to
her
it
was
not
easy
to
estimate
exactly
the
strength
and
warmth
of
one
feelings
for
a
woman
till
they
have
run
away
with
one
he
began
to
give
more
time
to
his
men
friends
there
was
jessop
at
the
art
school
swain
who
was
chemistry
demonstrator
at
the
university
newton
who
was
a
teacher
besides
edgar
and
miriam
younger
brothers
pleading
work
he
sketched
and
studied
with
jessop
he
called
in
the
university
for
swain
and
the
two
went
down
town
together
having
come
home
in
the
train
with
newton
he
called
and
had
a
game
of
billiards
with
him
in
the
moon
and
stars
if
he
gave
to
miriam
the
excuse
of
his
men
friends
he
felt
quite
justified
his
mother
began
to
be
relieved
he
always
told
her
where
he
had
been
during
the
summer
clara
wore
sometimes
a
dress
of
soft
cotton
stuff
with
loose
sleeves
when
she
lifted
her
hands
her
sleeves
fell
back
and
her
beautiful
strong
arms
shone
out
half
a
minute
he
cried
hold
your
arm
he
made
sketches
of
her
hand
and
arm
and
the
drawings
contained
some
of
the
fascination
the
real
thing
had
for
him
miriam
who
always
went
scrupulously
through
his
books
and
papers
saw
the
drawings
i
think
clara
has
such
beautiful
arms
he
said
yes
when
did
you
draw
them
on
tuesday
in
the
you
know
i
got
a
corner
where
i
can
work
often
i
can
do
every
single
thing
they
need
in
the
department
before
dinner
then
i
work
for
myself
in
the
afternoon
and
just
see
to
things
at
yes
she
said
turning
the
leaves
of
his
frequently
he
hated
miriam
he
hated
her
as
she
bent
forward
and
pored
over
his
things
he
hated
her
way
of
patiently
casting
him
up
as
if
he
were
an
endless
psychological
account
when
he
was
with
her
he
hated
her
for
having
got
him
and
yet
not
got
him
and
he
tortured
her
she
took
all
and
gave
nothing
he
said
at
least
she
gave
no
living
warmth
she
was
never
alive
and
giving
off
life
looking
for
her
was
like
looking
for
something
which
did
not
exist
she
was
only
his
conscience
not
his
mate
he
hated
her
violently
and
was
more
cruel
to
her
they
dragged
on
till
the
next
summer
he
saw
more
and
more
of
clara
at
last
he
spoke
he
had
been
sitting
working
at
home
one
evening
there
was
between
him
and
his
mother
a
peculiar
condition
of
people
frankly
finding
fault
with
each
other
morel
was
strong
on
her
feet
again
he
was
not
going
to
stick
to
miriam
very
well
then
she
would
stand
aloof
till
he
said
something
it
had
been
coming
a
long
time
this
bursting
of
the
storm
in
him
when
he
would
come
back
to
her
this
evening
there
was
between
them
a
peculiar
condition
of
suspense
he
worked
feverishly
and
mechanically
so
that
he
could
escape
from
himself
it
grew
late
through
the
open
door
stealthily
came
the
scent
of
madonna
lilies
almost
as
if
it
were
prowling
abroad
suddenly
he
got
up
and
went
out
of
doors
the
beauty
of
the
night
made
him
want
to
shout
a
dusky
gold
was
sinking
behind
the
black
sycamore
at
the
end
of
the
garden
making
the
sky
dull
purple
with
its
glow
nearer
a
dim
white
fence
of
lilies
went
across
the
garden
and
the
air
all
round
seemed
to
stir
with
scent
as
if
it
were
alive
he
went
across
the
bed
of
pinks
whose
keen
perfume
came
sharply
across
the
rocking
heavy
scent
of
the
lilies
and
stood
alongside
the
white
barrier
of
flowers
they
flagged
all
loose
as
if
they
were
panting
the
scent
made
him
drunk
he
went
down
to
the
field
to
watch
the
moon
sink
under
a
corncrake
in
the
called
insistently
the
moon
slid
quite
quickly
downwards
growing
more
flushed
behind
him
the
great
flowers
leaned
as
if
they
were
calling
and
then
like
a
shock
he
caught
another
perfume
something
raw
and
coarse
hunting
round
he
found
the
purple
iris
touched
their
fleshy
throats
and
their
dark
grasping
hands
at
any
rate
he
had
found
something
they
stood
stiff
in
the
darkness
their
scent
was
brutal
the
moon
was
melting
down
upon
the
crest
of
the
hill
it
was
gone
all
was
dark
the
corncrake
called
still
breaking
off
a
pink
he
suddenly
went
indoors
come
my
boy
said
his
mother
i
sure
it
time
you
went
to
he
stood
with
the
pink
against
his
lips
i
shall
break
off
with
miriam
mother
he
answered
calmly
she
looked
up
at
him
over
her
spectacles
he
was
staring
back
at
her
unswerving
she
met
his
eyes
for
a
moment
then
took
off
her
glasses
he
was
white
the
male
was
up
in
him
dominant
she
did
not
want
to
see
him
too
clearly
but
i
thought
she
began
well
he
answered
i
do
love
her
i
do
want
to
marry
her
so
i
shall
have
but
exclaimed
his
mother
amazed
i
thought
lately
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
have
her
and
so
i
said
i
had
i
wanted
to
but
now
i
do
want
it
no
good
i
shall
break
off
on
sunday
i
ought
to
ought
i
you
know
best
you
know
i
said
so
long
i
ca
help
that
now
i
shall
break
off
on
well
said
his
mother
i
think
it
will
be
best
but
lately
i
decided
you
had
made
up
your
mind
to
have
her
so
i
said
nothing
and
should
have
said
nothing
but
i
say
as
i
have
always
said
i
do
think
she
is
suited
to
on
sunday
i
break
off
he
said
smelling
the
pink
he
put
the
flower
in
his
mouth
unthinking
he
bared
his
teeth
closed
them
on
the
blossom
slowly
and
had
a
mouthful
of
petals
these
he
spat
into
the
fire
kissed
his
mother
and
went
to
bed
on
sunday
he
went
up
to
the
farm
in
the
early
afternoon
he
had
written
miriam
that
they
would
walk
over
the
fields
to
hucknall
his
mother
was
very
tender
with
him
he
said
nothing
but
she
saw
the
effort
it
was
costing
the
peculiar
set
look
on
his
face
stilled
her
never
mind
my
son
she
said
you
will
be
so
much
better
when
it
is
all
paul
glanced
swiftly
at
his
mother
in
surprise
and
resentment
he
did
not
want
sympathy
miriam
met
him
at
the
she
was
wearing
a
new
dress
of
figured
muslin
that
had
short
sleeves
those
short
sleeves
and
arms
beneath
them
such
pitiful
resigned
arms
gave
him
so
much
pain
that
they
helped
to
make
him
cruel
she
had
made
herself
look
so
beautiful
and
fresh
for
him
she
seemed
to
blossom
for
him
alone
every
time
he
looked
at
her
a
mature
young
woman
now
and
beautiful
in
her
new
dress
it
hurt
so
much
that
his
heart
seemed
almost
to
be
bursting
with
the
restraint
he
put
on
it
but
he
had
decided
and
it
was
irrevocable
on
the
hills
they
sat
down
and
he
lay
with
his
head
in
her
lap
whilst
she
fingered
his
hair
she
knew
that
he
was
not
there
as
she
put
it
often
when
she
had
him
with
her
she
looked
for
him
and
could
not
find
him
but
this
afternoon
she
was
not
prepared
it
was
nearly
five
when
he
told
her
they
were
sitting
on
the
bank
of
a
stream
where
the
lip
of
turf
hung
over
a
hollow
bank
of
yellow
earth
and
he
was
hacking
away
with
a
stick
as
he
did
when
he
was
perturbed
and
cruel
i
have
been
thinking
he
said
we
ought
to
break
why
she
cried
in
surprise
because
it
no
good
going
why
is
it
no
good
it
is
i
do
want
to
marry
i
do
want
ever
to
marry
and
if
we
not
going
to
marry
it
no
good
going
but
why
do
you
say
this
now
because
i
made
up
my
and
what
about
these
last
months
and
the
things
you
told
me
then
i
ca
help
it
i
do
want
to
go
you
do
want
any
more
of
me
i
want
us
to
break
off
you
be
free
of
me
i
free
of
and
what
about
these
last
months
i
do
know
i
not
told
you
anything
but
what
i
thought
was
then
why
are
you
different
now
i
not
i
the
same
only
i
know
it
no
good
going
you
have
told
me
why
it
no
because
i
do
want
to
go
on
and
i
do
want
to
how
many
times
have
you
offered
to
marry
me
and
i
would
i
know
but
i
want
us
to
break
there
was
silence
for
a
moment
or
two
while
he
dug
viciously
at
the
earth
she
bent
her
head
pondering
he
was
an
unreasonable
child
he
was
like
an
infant
which
when
it
has
drunk
its
fill
throws
away
and
smashes
the
cup
she
looked
at
him
feeling
she
could
get
hold
of
him
and
wring
some
consistency
out
of
him
but
she
was
helpless
then
she
cried
i
have
said
you
were
only
fourteen
you
are
only
four
he
still
dug
at
the
earth
viciously
he
heard
you
are
a
child
of
four
she
repeated
in
her
anger
he
did
not
answer
but
said
in
his
heart
all
right
if
i
a
child
of
four
what
do
you
want
me
for
i
do
want
another
but
he
said
nothing
to
her
and
there
was
silence
and
have
you
told
your
people
she
asked
i
have
told
my
there
was
another
long
interval
of
silence
then
what
do
you
want
she
asked
why
i
want
us
to
separate
we
have
lived
on
each
other
all
these
years
now
let
us
stop
i
will
go
my
own
way
without
you
and
you
will
go
your
way
without
me
you
will
have
an
independent
life
of
your
own
there
was
in
it
some
truth
that
in
spite
of
her
bitterness
she
could
not
help
registering
she
knew
she
felt
in
a
sort
of
bondage
to
him
which
she
hated
because
she
could
not
control
it
she
hated
her
love
for
him
from
the
moment
it
grew
too
strong
for
her
and
deep
down
she
had
hated
him
because
she
loved
him
and
he
dominated
her
she
had
resisted
his
domination
she
had
fought
to
keep
herself
free
of
him
in
the
last
issue
and
she
was
free
of
him
even
more
than
he
of
her
and
he
continued
we
shall
always
be
more
or
less
each
other
work
you
have
done
a
lot
for
me
i
for
you
now
let
us
start
and
live
by
what
do
you
want
to
do
she
asked
nothing
only
to
be
free
he
answered
she
however
knew
in
her
heart
that
clara
influence
was
over
him
to
liberate
him
but
she
said
nothing
and
what
have
i
to
tell
my
mother
she
asked
i
told
my
mother
he
answered
that
i
was
breaking
off
clean
and
i
shall
not
tell
them
at
home
she
said
frowning
you
please
yourself
he
said
he
knew
he
had
landed
her
in
a
nasty
hole
and
was
leaving
her
in
the
lurch
it
angered
him
tell
them
you
would
and
wo
marry
me
and
have
broken
off
he
said
it
true
she
bit
her
finger
moodily
she
thought
over
their
whole
affair
she
had
known
it
would
come
to
this
she
had
seen
it
all
along
it
chimed
with
her
bitter
expectation
always
it
has
always
been
so
she
cried
it
has
been
one
long
battle
between
us
you
fighting
away
from
it
came
from
her
unawares
like
a
flash
of
lightning
the
man
heart
stood
still
was
this
how
she
saw
it
but
we
had
some
perfect
hours
some
perfect
times
when
we
were
together
he
pleaded
never
she
cried
never
it
has
always
been
you
fighting
me
not
always
not
at
first
he
pleaded
always
from
the
very
beginning
always
the
same
she
had
finished
but
she
had
done
enough
he
sat
aghast
he
had
wanted
to
say
it
has
been
good
but
it
is
at
an
and
she
she
whose
love
he
had
believed
in
when
he
had
despised
himself
denied
that
their
love
had
ever
been
love
he
had
always
fought
away
from
her
then
it
had
been
monstrous
there
had
never
been
anything
really
between
them
all
the
time
he
had
been
imagining
something
where
there
was
nothing
and
she
had
known
she
had
known
so
much
and
had
told
him
so
little
she
had
known
all
the
time
all
the
time
this
was
at
the
bottom
of
her
he
sat
silent
in
bitterness
at
last
the
whole
affair
appeared
in
a
cynical
aspect
to
him
she
had
really
played
with
him
not
he
with
her
she
had
hidden
all
her
condemnation
from
him
had
flattered
him
and
despised
him
she
despised
him
now
he
grew
intellectual
and
cruel
you
ought
to
marry
a
man
who
worships
you
he
said
then
you
could
do
as
you
liked
with
him
plenty
of
men
will
worship
you
if
you
get
on
the
private
side
of
their
natures
you
ought
to
marry
one
such
they
would
never
fight
you
thank
you
she
said
but
do
advise
me
to
marry
someone
else
any
more
you
done
it
very
well
he
said
i
will
say
no
he
sat
still
feeling
as
if
he
had
had
a
blow
instead
of
giving
one
their
eight
years
of
friendship
and
love
the
eight
years
of
his
life
were
nullified
when
did
you
think
of
this
she
asked
i
thought
definitely
on
thursday
i
knew
it
was
coming
she
said
that
pleased
him
bitterly
oh
very
well
if
she
knew
then
it
come
as
a
surprise
to
her
he
thought
and
have
you
said
anything
to
clara
she
asked
no
but
i
shall
tell
her
there
was
a
silence
do
you
remember
the
things
you
said
this
time
last
year
in
my
grandmother
house
nay
last
month
even
yes
he
said
i
do
and
i
meant
them
i
ca
help
that
it
it
has
failed
because
you
want
something
it
would
have
failed
whether
or
not
you
never
believed
in
she
laughed
strangely
he
sat
in
silence
he
was
full
of
a
feeling
that
she
had
deceived
him
she
had
despised
him
when
he
thought
she
worshipped
him
she
had
let
him
say
wrong
things
and
had
not
contradicted
him
she
had
let
him
fight
alone
but
it
stuck
in
his
throat
that
she
had
despised
him
whilst
he
thought
she
worshipped
him
she
should
have
told
him
when
she
found
fault
with
him
she
had
not
played
fair
he
hated
her
all
these
years
she
had
treated
him
as
if
he
were
a
hero
and
thought
of
him
secretly
as
an
infant
a
foolish
child
then
why
had
she
left
the
foolish
child
to
his
folly
his
heart
was
hard
against
her
she
sat
full
of
bitterness
she
had
known
oh
well
she
had
known
all
the
time
he
was
away
from
her
she
had
summed
him
up
seen
his
littleness
his
meanness
and
his
folly
even
she
had
guarded
her
soul
against
him
she
was
not
overthrown
not
prostrated
not
even
much
hurt
she
had
known
only
why
as
he
sat
there
had
he
still
this
strange
dominance
over
her
his
very
movements
fascinated
her
as
if
she
were
hypnotised
by
him
yet
he
was
despicable
false
inconsistent
and
mean
why
this
bondage
for
her
why
was
it
the
movement
of
his
arm
stirred
her
as
nothing
else
in
the
world
could
why
was
she
fastened
to
him
why
even
now
if
he
looked
at
her
and
commanded
her
would
she
have
to
obey
she
would
obey
him
in
his
trifling
commands
but
once
he
was
obeyed
then
she
had
him
in
her
power
she
knew
to
lead
him
where
she
would
she
was
sure
of
herself
only
this
new
influence
ah
he
was
not
a
man
he
was
a
baby
that
cries
for
the
newest
toy
and
all
the
attachment
of
his
soul
would
not
keep
him
very
well
he
would
have
to
go
but
he
would
come
back
when
he
had
tired
of
his
new
sensation
he
hacked
at
the
earth
till
she
was
fretted
to
death
she
rose
he
sat
flinging
lumps
of
earth
in
the
stream
we
will
go
and
have
tea
here
he
asked
yes
she
answered
they
chattered
over
irrelevant
subjects
during
tea
he
held
forth
on
the
love
of
ornament
the
cottage
parlour
moved
him
thereto
and
its
connection
with
aesthetics
she
was
cold
and
quiet
as
they
walked
home
she
asked
and
we
shall
not
see
each
other
no
or
rarely
he
answered
nor
write
she
asked
almost
sarcastically
as
you
will
he
answered
we
not
strangers
never
should
be
whatever
happened
i
will
write
to
you
now
and
again
you
please
i
see
she
answered
cuttingly
but
he
was
at
that
stage
at
which
nothing
else
hurts
he
had
made
a
great
cleavage
in
his
life
he
had
had
a
great
shock
when
she
had
told
him
their
love
had
been
always
a
conflict
nothing
more
mattered
if
it
never
had
been
much
there
was
no
need
to
make
a
fuss
that
it
was
ended
he
left
her
at
the
as
she
went
home
solitary
in
her
new
frock
having
her
people
to
face
at
the
other
end
he
stood
still
with
shame
and
pain
in
the
highroad
thinking
of
the
suffering
he
caused
her
in
the
reaction
towards
restoring
his
he
went
into
the
willow
tree
for
a
drink
there
were
four
girls
who
had
been
out
for
the
day
drinking
a
modest
glass
of
port
they
had
some
chocolates
on
the
table
paul
sat
near
with
his
whisky
he
noticed
the
girls
whispering
and
nudging
presently
one
a
bonny
dark
hussy
leaned
to
him
and
said
have
a
chocolate
the
others
laughed
loudly
at
her
impudence
all
right
said
paul
give
me
a
hard
one
nut
i
do
like
here
you
are
then
said
the
girl
here
an
almond
for
she
held
the
sweet
between
her
fingers
he
opened
his
mouth
she
popped
it
in
and
blushed
you
are
nice
he
said
well
she
answered
we
thought
you
looked
overcast
and
they
dared
me
offer
you
a
i
do
mind
if
i
have
another
another
sort
he
said
and
presently
they
were
all
laughing
together
it
was
nine
when
he
got
home
falling
dark
he
entered
the
house
in
silence
his
mother
who
had
been
waiting
rose
anxiously
i
told
her
he
said
i
glad
replied
the
mother
with
great
relief
he
hung
up
his
cap
wearily
i
said
we
have
done
altogether
he
said
that
right
my
son
said
the
mother
it
hard
for
her
now
but
best
in
the
long
run
i
know
you
were
suited
for
he
laughed
shakily
as
he
sat
down
i
had
such
a
lark
with
some
girls
in
a
pub
he
said
his
mother
looked
at
him
he
had
forgotten
miriam
now
he
told
her
about
the
girls
in
the
willow
tree
morel
looked
at
him
it
seemed
unreal
his
gaiety
at
the
back
of
it
was
too
much
horror
and
misery
now
have
some
supper
she
said
very
gently
afterwards
he
said
wistfully
she
never
thought
she
have
me
mother
not
from
the
first
and
so
she
not
i
afraid
said
his
mother
she
does
give
up
hopes
of
you
no
he
said
perhaps
you
find
it
better
to
have
done
she
said
i
do
know
he
said
desperately
well
leave
her
alone
replied
his
mother
so
he
left
her
and
she
was
alone
very
few
people
cared
for
her
and
she
for
very
few
people
she
remained
alone
with
herself
waiting
chapter
xii
passion
he
was
gradually
making
it
possible
to
earn
a
livelihood
by
his
art
liberty
had
taken
several
of
his
painted
designs
on
various
stuffs
and
he
could
sell
designs
for
embroideries
for
and
similar
things
in
one
or
two
places
it
was
not
very
much
he
made
at
present
but
he
might
extend
it
he
had
also
made
friends
with
the
designer
for
a
pottery
firm
and
was
gaining
some
knowledge
of
his
new
acquaintance
art
the
applied
arts
interested
him
very
much
at
the
same
time
he
laboured
slowly
at
his
pictures
he
loved
to
paint
large
figures
full
of
light
but
not
merely
made
up
of
lights
and
cast
shadows
like
the
impressionists
rather
definite
figures
that
had
a
certain
luminous
quality
like
some
of
michael
angelo
people
and
these
he
fitted
into
a
landscape
in
what
he
thought
true
proportion
he
worked
a
great
deal
from
memory
using
everybody
he
knew
he
believed
firmly
in
his
work
that
it
was
good
and
valuable
in
spite
of
fits
of
depression
shrinking
everything
he
believed
in
his
work
he
was
when
he
said
his
first
confident
thing
to
his
mother
mother
he
said
i
s
make
a
painter
that
they
attend
she
sniffed
in
her
quaint
fashion
it
was
like
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
very
well
my
boy
we
see
she
said
you
shall
see
my
pigeon
you
see
if
you
not
swanky
one
of
these
days
i
quite
content
my
boy
she
smiled
but
you
have
to
alter
look
at
you
with
minnie
minnie
was
the
small
servant
a
girl
of
fourteen
and
what
about
minnie
asked
morel
with
dignity
i
heard
her
this
morning
morel
i
was
going
to
do
that
when
you
went
out
in
the
rain
for
some
coal
he
said
that
looks
a
lot
like
your
being
able
to
manage
servants
well
it
was
only
the
child
niceness
said
morel
and
you
apologising
to
her
ca
do
two
things
at
once
can
you
she
was
busy
washing
up
replied
morel
and
what
did
she
say
could
easy
have
waited
a
bit
now
look
how
your
feet
paddle
yes
brazen
young
baggage
said
morel
smiling
he
looked
at
his
mother
laughing
she
was
quite
warm
and
rosy
again
with
love
of
him
it
seemed
as
if
all
the
sunshine
were
on
her
for
a
moment
he
continued
his
work
gladly
she
seemed
so
well
when
she
was
happy
that
he
forgot
her
grey
hair
and
that
year
she
went
with
him
to
the
isle
of
wight
for
a
holiday
it
was
too
exciting
for
them
both
and
too
beautiful
morel
was
full
of
joy
and
wonder
but
he
would
have
her
walk
with
him
more
than
she
was
able
she
had
a
bad
fainting
bout
so
grey
her
face
was
so
blue
her
mouth
it
was
agony
to
him
he
felt
as
if
someone
were
pushing
a
knife
in
his
chest
then
she
was
better
again
and
he
forgot
but
the
anxiety
remained
inside
him
like
a
wound
that
did
not
close
after
leaving
miriam
he
went
almost
straight
to
clara
on
the
monday
following
the
day
of
the
rupture
he
went
down
to
the
she
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
they
had
grown
very
intimate
unawares
she
saw
a
new
brightness
about
him
well
queen
of
sheba
he
said
laughing
but
why
she
asked
i
think
it
suits
you
you
got
a
new
frock
she
flushed
asking
and
what
of
it
suits
you
awfully
i
could
design
you
a
how
would
it
be
he
stood
in
front
of
her
his
eyes
glittering
as
he
expounded
he
kept
her
eyes
fixed
with
his
then
suddenly
he
took
hold
of
her
she
back
he
drew
the
stuff
of
her
blouse
tighter
smoothed
it
over
her
breast
more
so
he
explained
but
they
were
both
of
them
flaming
with
blushes
and
immediately
he
ran
away
he
had
touched
her
his
whole
body
was
quivering
with
the
sensation
there
was
already
a
sort
of
secret
understanding
between
them
the
next
evening
he
went
to
the
cinematograph
with
her
for
a
few
minutes
before
as
they
sat
he
saw
her
hand
lying
near
him
for
some
moments
he
dared
not
touch
it
the
pictures
danced
and
dithered
then
he
took
her
hand
in
his
it
was
large
and
firm
it
filled
his
grasp
he
held
it
fast
she
neither
moved
nor
made
any
sign
when
they
came
out
his
train
was
due
he
hesitated
she
said
he
darted
away
across
the
road
the
next
day
he
came
again
talking
to
her
she
was
rather
superior
with
him
shall
we
go
a
walk
on
monday
he
asked
she
turned
her
face
aside
shall
you
tell
miriam
she
replied
sarcastically
i
have
broken
off
with
her
he
said
when
last
you
quarrelled
no
i
had
made
up
my
mind
i
told
her
quite
definitely
i
should
consider
myself
clara
did
not
answer
and
he
returned
to
his
work
she
was
so
quiet
and
so
superb
on
the
saturday
evening
he
asked
her
to
come
and
drink
coffee
with
him
in
a
restaurant
meeting
him
after
work
was
over
she
came
looking
very
reserved
and
very
distant
he
had
of
an
hour
to
we
will
walk
a
little
while
he
said
she
agreed
and
they
went
past
the
castle
into
the
park
he
was
afraid
of
her
she
walked
moodily
at
his
side
with
a
kind
of
resentful
reluctant
angry
walk
he
was
afraid
to
take
her
hand
which
way
shall
we
go
he
asked
as
they
walked
in
darkness
i
do
then
we
go
up
the
he
suddenly
turned
round
they
had
passed
the
park
steps
she
stood
still
in
resentment
at
his
suddenly
abandoning
her
he
looked
for
her
she
stood
aloof
he
caught
her
suddenly
in
his
arms
held
her
strained
for
a
moment
kissed
her
then
he
let
her
go
come
along
he
said
penitent
she
followed
him
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
her
they
went
in
silence
when
they
came
to
the
light
he
let
go
her
hand
neither
spoke
till
they
reached
the
station
then
they
looked
each
other
in
the
eyes
she
said
and
he
went
for
his
train
his
body
acted
mechanically
people
talked
to
him
he
heard
faint
echoes
answering
them
he
was
in
a
delirium
he
felt
that
he
would
go
mad
if
monday
did
not
come
at
once
on
monday
he
would
see
her
again
all
himself
was
pitched
there
ahead
sunday
intervened
he
could
not
bear
it
he
could
not
see
her
till
monday
and
sunday
intervened
hour
after
hour
of
tension
he
wanted
to
beat
his
head
against
the
door
of
the
carriage
but
he
sat
still
he
drank
some
whisky
on
the
way
home
but
it
only
made
it
worse
his
mother
must
not
be
upset
that
was
all
he
dissembled
and
got
quickly
to
bed
there
he
sat
dressed
with
his
chin
on
his
knees
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
far
hill
with
its
few
lights
he
neither
thought
nor
slept
but
sat
perfectly
still
staring
and
when
at
last
he
was
so
cold
that
he
came
to
himself
he
found
his
watch
had
stopped
at
two
it
was
after
three
he
was
exhausted
but
still
there
was
the
torment
of
knowing
it
was
only
sunday
morning
he
went
to
bed
and
slept
then
he
cycled
all
day
long
till
he
was
fagged
out
and
he
scarcely
knew
where
he
had
been
but
the
day
after
was
monday
he
slept
till
four
then
he
lay
and
thought
he
was
coming
nearer
to
himself
he
could
see
himself
real
somewhere
in
front
she
would
go
a
walk
with
him
in
the
afternoon
afternoon
it
seemed
years
ahead
slowly
the
hours
crawled
his
father
got
up
he
heard
him
pottering
about
then
the
miner
set
off
to
the
pit
his
heavy
boots
scraping
the
yard
cocks
were
still
crowing
a
cart
went
down
the
road
his
mother
got
up
she
knocked
the
fire
presently
she
called
him
softly
he
answered
as
if
he
were
asleep
this
shell
of
himself
did
well
he
was
walking
to
the
station
another
mile
the
train
was
near
nottingham
would
it
stop
before
the
tunnels
but
it
did
not
matter
it
would
get
there
before
he
was
at
jordan
she
would
come
in
half
an
hour
at
any
rate
she
would
be
near
he
had
done
the
letters
she
would
be
there
perhaps
she
had
not
come
he
ran
downstairs
ah
he
saw
her
through
the
glass
door
her
shoulders
stooping
a
little
to
her
work
made
him
feel
he
could
not
go
forward
he
could
not
stand
he
went
in
he
was
pale
nervous
awkward
and
quite
cold
would
she
misunderstand
him
he
could
not
write
his
real
self
with
this
shell
and
this
afternoon
he
struggled
to
say
you
will
come
i
think
so
she
replied
murmuring
he
stood
before
her
unable
to
say
a
word
she
hid
her
face
from
him
again
came
over
him
the
feeling
that
he
would
lose
consciousness
he
set
his
teeth
and
went
upstairs
he
had
done
everything
correctly
yet
and
he
would
do
so
all
the
morning
things
seemed
a
long
way
off
as
they
do
to
a
man
under
chloroform
he
himself
seemed
under
a
tight
band
of
constraint
then
there
was
his
other
self
in
the
distance
doing
things
entering
stuff
in
a
ledger
and
he
watched
that
him
carefully
to
see
he
made
no
mistake
but
the
ache
and
strain
of
it
could
not
go
on
much
longer
he
worked
incessantly
still
it
was
only
twelve
as
if
he
had
nailed
his
clothing
against
the
desk
he
stood
there
and
worked
forcing
every
stroke
out
of
himself
it
was
a
quarter
to
one
he
could
clear
away
then
he
ran
downstairs
you
will
meet
me
at
the
fountain
at
two
he
said
i
ca
be
there
till
yes
he
said
she
saw
his
dark
mad
eyes
i
will
try
at
a
quarter
and
he
had
to
be
content
he
went
and
got
some
dinner
all
the
time
he
was
still
under
chloroform
and
every
minute
was
stretched
out
indefinitely
he
walked
miles
of
streets
then
he
thought
he
would
be
late
at
the
he
was
at
the
fountain
at
five
past
two
the
torture
of
the
next
quarter
of
an
hour
was
refined
beyond
expression
it
was
the
anguish
of
combining
the
living
self
with
the
shell
then
he
saw
her
she
came
and
he
was
there
you
are
late
he
said
only
five
minutes
she
answered
i
never
have
done
it
to
you
he
laughed
she
was
in
a
dark
blue
costume
he
looked
at
her
beautiful
figure
you
want
some
flowers
he
said
going
to
the
nearest
florist
she
followed
him
in
silence
he
bought
her
a
bunch
of
scarlet
carnations
she
put
them
in
her
coat
flushing
that
a
fine
colour
he
said
i
rather
have
had
something
softer
she
said
he
laughed
do
you
feel
like
a
blot
of
vermilion
walking
down
the
street
he
said
she
hung
her
head
afraid
of
the
people
they
met
he
looked
sideways
at
her
as
they
walked
there
was
a
wonderful
close
down
on
her
face
near
the
ear
that
he
wanted
to
touch
and
a
certain
heaviness
the
heaviness
of
a
very
full
ear
of
corn
that
dips
slightly
in
the
wind
that
there
was
about
her
made
his
brain
spin
he
seemed
to
be
spinning
down
the
street
everything
going
round
as
they
sat
in
the
tramcar
she
leaned
her
heavy
shoulder
against
him
and
he
took
her
hand
he
felt
himself
coming
round
from
the
anaesthetic
beginning
to
breathe
her
ear
among
her
blonde
hair
was
near
to
him
the
temptation
to
kiss
it
was
almost
too
great
but
there
were
other
people
on
top
of
the
car
it
still
remained
to
him
to
kiss
it
after
all
he
was
not
himself
he
was
some
attribute
of
hers
like
the
sunshine
that
fell
on
her
he
looked
quickly
away
it
had
been
raining
the
big
bluff
of
the
castle
rock
was
streaked
with
rain
as
it
reared
above
the
flat
of
the
town
they
crossed
the
wide
black
space
of
the
midland
railway
and
passed
the
cattle
enclosure
that
stood
out
white
then
they
ran
down
sordid
wilford
road
she
rocked
slightly
to
the
tram
motion
and
as
she
leaned
against
him
rocked
upon
him
he
was
a
vigorous
slender
man
with
exhaustless
energy
his
face
was
rough
with
features
like
the
common
people
but
his
eyes
under
the
deep
brows
were
so
full
of
life
that
they
fascinated
her
they
seemed
to
dance
and
yet
they
were
still
trembling
on
the
finest
balance
of
laughter
his
mouth
the
same
was
just
going
to
spring
into
a
laugh
of
triumph
yet
did
not
there
was
a
sharp
suspense
about
him
she
bit
her
lip
moodily
his
hand
was
hard
clenched
over
hers
they
paid
their
two
halfpennies
at
the
turnstile
and
crossed
the
bridge
the
trent
was
very
full
it
swept
silent
and
insidious
under
the
bridge
travelling
in
a
soft
body
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
rain
on
the
river
levels
were
flat
gleams
of
flood
water
the
sky
was
grey
with
glisten
of
silver
here
and
there
in
wilford
churchyard
the
dahlias
were
sodden
with
rain
wet
balls
no
one
was
on
the
path
that
went
along
the
green
river
meadow
along
the
colonnade
there
was
the
faintest
haze
over
the
water
and
the
green
and
the
that
were
spangled
with
gold
the
river
slid
by
in
a
body
utterly
silent
and
swift
intertwining
among
itself
like
some
subtle
complex
creature
clara
walked
moodily
beside
him
why
she
asked
at
length
in
rather
a
jarring
tone
did
you
leave
miriam
he
frowned
because
i
wanted
to
leave
her
he
said
why
because
i
did
want
to
go
on
with
her
and
i
did
want
to
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
they
picked
their
way
down
the
muddy
path
drops
of
water
fell
from
the
you
did
want
to
marry
miriam
or
you
did
want
to
marry
at
all
she
asked
both
he
answered
both
they
had
to
manoeuvre
to
get
to
the
stile
because
of
the
pools
of
water
and
what
did
she
say
clara
asked
miriam
she
said
i
was
a
baby
of
four
and
that
i
always
had
battled
her
clara
pondered
over
this
for
a
time
but
you
have
really
been
going
with
her
for
some
time
she
asked
and
now
you
do
want
any
more
of
her
no
i
know
it
no
she
pondered
again
do
you
think
you
treated
her
rather
badly
she
asked
yes
i
ought
to
have
dropped
it
years
back
but
it
would
have
been
no
good
going
on
two
wrongs
do
make
a
how
old
are
you
clara
asked
and
i
am
thirty
she
said
i
know
you
i
shall
be
or
am
i
i
neither
know
nor
care
what
does
it
matter
they
were
at
the
entrance
to
the
grove
the
wet
red
track
already
sticky
with
fallen
leaves
went
up
the
steep
bank
between
the
grass
on
either
side
stood
the
like
pillars
along
a
great
aisle
arching
over
and
making
high
up
a
roof
from
which
the
dead
leaves
fell
all
was
empty
and
silent
and
wet
she
stood
on
top
of
the
stile
and
he
held
both
her
hands
laughing
she
looked
down
into
his
eyes
then
she
leaped
her
breast
came
against
his
he
held
her
and
covered
her
face
with
kisses
they
went
on
up
the
slippery
steep
red
path
presently
she
released
his
hand
and
put
it
round
her
waist
you
press
the
vein
in
my
arm
holding
it
so
tightly
she
said
they
walked
along
his
felt
the
rocking
of
her
breast
all
was
silent
and
deserted
on
the
left
the
red
wet
showed
through
the
doorways
between
the
and
their
branches
on
the
right
looking
down
they
could
see
the
of
elms
growing
far
beneath
them
hear
occasionally
the
gurgle
of
the
river
sometimes
there
below
they
caught
glimpses
of
the
full
trent
and
of
dotted
with
small
cattle
it
has
scarcely
altered
since
little
kirke
white
used
to
come
he
said
but
he
was
watching
her
throat
below
the
ear
where
the
flush
was
fusing
into
the
and
her
mouth
that
pouted
disconsolate
she
stirred
against
him
as
she
walked
and
his
body
was
like
a
taut
string
halfway
up
the
big
colonnade
of
elms
where
the
grove
rose
highest
above
the
river
their
forward
movement
faltered
to
an
end
he
led
her
across
to
the
grass
under
the
trees
at
the
edge
of
the
path
the
cliff
of
red
earth
sloped
swiftly
down
through
trees
and
bushes
to
the
river
that
glimmered
and
was
dark
between
the
foliage
the
were
very
green
he
and
she
stood
leaning
against
one
another
silent
afraid
their
bodies
touching
all
along
there
came
a
quick
gurgle
from
the
river
below
why
he
asked
at
length
did
you
hate
baxter
dawes
she
turned
to
him
with
a
splendid
movement
her
mouth
was
offered
him
and
her
throat
her
eyes
were
her
breast
was
tilted
as
if
it
asked
for
him
he
flashed
with
a
small
laugh
shut
his
eyes
and
met
her
in
a
long
whole
kiss
her
mouth
fused
with
his
their
bodies
were
sealed
and
annealed
it
was
some
minutes
before
they
withdrew
they
were
standing
beside
the
public
path
will
you
go
down
to
the
river
he
asked
she
looked
at
him
leaving
herself
in
his
hands
he
went
over
the
brim
of
the
declivity
and
began
to
climb
down
it
is
slippery
he
said
never
mind
she
replied
the
red
clay
went
down
almost
sheer
he
slid
went
from
one
tuft
of
grass
to
the
next
hanging
on
to
the
bushes
making
for
a
little
platform
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
there
he
waited
for
her
laughing
with
excitement
her
shoes
were
clogged
with
red
earth
it
was
hard
for
her
he
frowned
at
last
he
caught
her
hand
and
she
stood
beside
him
the
cliff
rose
above
them
and
fell
away
below
her
colour
was
up
her
eyes
flashed
he
looked
at
the
big
drop
below
them
it
risky
he
said
or
messy
at
any
rate
shall
we
go
back
not
for
my
sake
she
said
quickly
all
right
you
see
i
ca
help
you
i
should
only
hinder
give
me
that
little
parcel
and
your
gloves
your
poor
shoes
they
stood
perched
on
the
face
of
the
declivity
under
the
trees
well
i
go
again
he
said
away
he
went
slipping
staggering
sliding
to
the
next
tree
into
which
he
fell
with
a
slam
that
nearly
shook
the
breath
out
of
him
she
came
after
cautiously
hanging
on
to
the
twigs
and
grasses
so
they
descended
stage
by
stage
to
the
river
brink
there
to
his
disgust
the
flood
had
eaten
away
the
path
and
the
red
decline
ran
straight
into
the
water
he
dug
in
his
heels
and
brought
himself
up
violently
the
string
of
the
parcel
broke
with
a
snap
the
brown
parcel
bounded
down
leaped
into
the
water
and
sailed
smoothly
away
he
hung
on
to
his
tree
well
i
be
damned
he
cried
crossly
then
he
laughed
she
was
coming
perilously
down
mind
he
warned
her
he
stood
with
his
back
to
the
tree
waiting
come
now
he
called
opening
his
arms
she
let
herself
run
he
caught
her
and
together
they
stood
watching
the
dark
water
scoop
at
the
raw
edge
of
the
bank
the
parcel
had
sailed
out
of
sight
it
does
matter
she
said
he
held
her
close
and
kissed
her
there
was
only
room
for
their
four
feet
it
a
swindle
he
said
but
there
a
rut
where
a
man
has
been
so
if
we
go
on
i
guess
we
shall
find
the
path
the
river
slid
and
twined
its
great
volume
on
the
other
bank
cattle
were
feeding
on
the
desolate
flats
the
cliff
rose
high
above
paul
and
clara
on
their
right
hand
they
stood
against
the
tree
in
the
watery
silence
let
us
try
going
forward
he
said
and
they
struggled
in
the
red
clay
along
the
groove
a
man
nailed
boots
had
made
they
were
hot
and
flushed
their
barkled
shoes
hung
heavy
on
their
steps
at
last
they
found
the
broken
path
it
was
littered
with
rubble
from
the
water
but
at
any
rate
it
was
easier
they
cleaned
their
boots
with
twigs
his
heart
was
beating
thick
and
fast
suddenly
coming
on
to
the
little
level
he
saw
two
figures
of
men
standing
silent
at
the
water
edge
his
heart
leaped
they
were
fishing
he
turned
and
put
his
hand
up
warningly
to
clara
she
hesitated
buttoned
her
coat
the
two
went
on
together
the
fishermen
turned
curiously
to
watch
the
two
intruders
on
their
privacy
and
solitude
they
had
had
a
fire
but
it
was
nearly
out
all
kept
perfectly
still
the
men
turned
again
to
their
fishing
stood
over
the
grey
glinting
river
like
statues
clara
went
with
bowed
head
flushing
he
was
laughing
to
himself
directly
they
passed
out
of
sight
behind
the
willows
now
they
ought
to
be
drowned
said
paul
softly
clara
did
not
answer
they
toiled
forward
along
a
tiny
path
on
the
river
lip
suddenly
it
vanished
the
bank
was
sheer
red
solid
clay
in
front
of
them
sloping
straight
into
the
river
he
stood
and
cursed
beneath
his
breath
setting
his
teeth
it
impossible
said
clara
he
stood
erect
looking
round
just
ahead
were
two
islets
in
the
stream
covered
with
osiers
but
they
were
unattainable
the
cliff
came
down
like
a
sloping
wall
from
far
above
their
heads
behind
not
far
back
were
the
fishermen
across
the
river
the
distant
cattle
fed
silently
in
the
desolate
afternoon
he
cursed
again
deeply
under
his
breath
he
gazed
up
the
great
steep
bank
was
there
no
hope
but
to
scale
back
to
the
public
path
stop
a
minute
he
said
and
digging
his
heels
sideways
into
the
steep
bank
of
red
clay
he
began
nimbly
to
mount
he
looked
across
at
every
at
last
he
found
what
he
wanted
two
side
by
side
on
the
hill
held
a
little
level
on
the
upper
face
between
their
roots
it
was
littered
with
damp
leaves
but
it
would
do
the
fishermen
were
perhaps
sufficiently
out
of
sight
he
threw
down
his
rainproof
and
waved
to
her
to
come
she
toiled
to
his
side
arriving
there
she
looked
at
him
heavily
dumbly
and
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
he
held
her
fast
as
he
looked
round
they
were
safe
enough
from
all
but
the
small
lonely
cows
over
the
river
he
sunk
his
mouth
on
her
throat
where
he
felt
her
heavy
pulse
beat
under
his
lips
everything
was
perfectly
still
there
was
nothing
in
the
afternoon
but
themselves
when
she
arose
he
looking
on
the
ground
all
the
time
saw
suddenly
sprinkled
on
the
black
wet
many
scarlet
carnation
petals
like
splashed
drops
of
blood
and
red
small
splashes
fell
from
her
bosom
streaming
down
her
dress
to
her
feet
your
flowers
are
smashed
he
said
she
looked
at
him
heavily
as
she
put
back
her
hair
suddenly
he
put
his
on
her
cheek
why
dost
look
so
heavy
he
reproached
her
she
smiled
sadly
as
if
she
felt
alone
in
herself
he
caressed
her
cheek
with
his
fingers
and
kissed
her
nay
he
said
never
thee
bother
she
gripped
his
fingers
tight
and
laughed
shakily
then
she
dropped
her
hand
he
put
the
hair
back
from
her
brows
stroking
her
temples
kissing
them
lightly
but
tha
shouldna
worrit
he
said
softly
pleading
no
i
do
worry
she
laughed
tenderly
and
resigned
yea
tha
does
dunna
thee
worrit
he
implored
caressing
no
she
consoled
him
kissing
him
they
had
a
stiff
climb
to
get
to
the
top
again
it
took
them
a
quarter
of
an
hour
when
he
got
on
to
the
level
grass
he
threw
off
his
cap
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
and
sighed
now
we
back
at
the
ordinary
level
he
said
she
sat
down
panting
on
the
tussocky
grass
her
cheeks
were
flushed
pink
he
kissed
her
and
she
gave
way
to
joy
and
now
i
clean
thy
boots
and
make
thee
fit
for
respectable
folk
he
said
he
kneeled
at
her
feet
worked
away
with
a
stick
and
tufts
of
grass
she
put
her
fingers
in
his
hair
drew
his
head
to
her
and
kissed
it
what
am
i
supposed
to
be
doing
he
said
looking
at
her
laughing
cleaning
shoes
or
dibbling
with
love
answer
me
that
just
whichever
i
please
she
replied
i
your
for
the
time
being
and
nothing
else
but
they
remained
looking
into
each
other
eyes
and
laughing
then
they
kissed
with
little
nibbling
kisses
he
went
with
his
tongue
like
his
mother
i
tell
you
nothing
gets
done
when
there
a
woman
and
he
returned
to
his
singing
softly
she
touched
his
thick
hair
and
he
kissed
her
fingers
he
worked
away
at
her
shoes
at
last
they
were
quite
presentable
there
you
are
you
see
he
said
are
i
a
great
hand
at
restoring
you
to
respectability
stand
up
there
you
look
as
irreproachable
as
britannia
herself
he
cleaned
his
own
boots
a
little
washed
his
hands
in
a
puddle
and
sang
they
went
on
into
clifton
village
he
was
madly
in
love
with
her
every
movement
she
made
every
crease
in
her
garments
sent
a
hot
flash
through
him
and
seemed
adorable
the
old
lady
at
whose
house
they
had
tea
was
roused
into
gaiety
by
them
i
could
wish
you
had
something
of
a
better
day
she
said
hovering
round
nay
he
laughed
we
been
saying
how
nice
it
the
old
lady
looked
at
him
curiously
there
was
a
peculiar
glow
and
charm
about
him
his
eyes
were
dark
and
laughing
he
rubbed
his
moustache
with
a
glad
movement
have
you
been
saying
so
she
exclaimed
a
light
rousing
in
her
old
eyes
truly
he
laughed
then
i
sure
the
day
good
enough
said
the
old
lady
she
fussed
about
and
did
not
want
to
leave
them
i
do
know
whether
you
like
some
radishes
as
well
she
said
to
clara
but
i
got
some
in
the
garden
and
a
clara
flushed
she
looked
very
handsome
i
should
like
some
radishes
she
answered
and
the
old
lady
pottered
off
gleefully
if
she
knew
said
clara
quietly
to
him
well
she
does
know
and
it
shows
we
nice
in
ourselves
at
any
rate
you
look
quite
enough
to
satisfy
an
archangel
and
i
sure
i
feel
harmless
so
if
it
makes
you
look
nice
and
makes
folk
happy
when
they
have
us
and
makes
us
happy
why
we
not
cheating
them
out
of
much
they
went
on
with
the
meal
when
they
were
going
away
the
old
lady
came
timidly
with
three
tiny
dahlias
in
full
blow
neat
as
bees
and
speckled
scarlet
and
white
she
stood
before
clara
pleased
with
herself
saying
i
do
know
whether
and
holding
the
flowers
forward
in
her
old
hand
oh
how
pretty
cried
clara
accepting
the
flowers
shall
she
have
them
all
asked
paul
reproachfully
of
the
old
woman
yes
she
shall
have
them
all
she
replied
beaming
with
joy
you
have
got
enough
for
your
ah
but
i
shall
ask
her
to
give
me
one
he
teased
then
she
does
as
she
pleases
said
the
old
lady
smiling
and
she
bobbed
a
little
curtsey
of
delight
clara
was
rather
quiet
and
uncomfortable
as
they
walked
along
he
said
you
do
feel
criminal
do
you
she
looked
at
him
with
startled
grey
eyes
criminal
she
said
but
you
seem
to
feel
you
have
done
a
wrong
no
she
said
i
only
think
they
knew
if
they
knew
they
cease
to
understand
as
it
is
they
do
understand
and
they
like
it
what
do
they
matter
here
with
only
the
trees
and
me
you
do
feel
not
the
least
bit
wrong
do
you
he
took
her
by
the
arm
held
her
facing
him
holding
her
eyes
with
his
something
fretted
him
not
sinners
are
we
he
said
with
an
uneasy
little
frown
no
she
replied
he
kissed
her
laughing
you
like
your
little
bit
of
guiltiness
i
believe
he
said
i
believe
eve
enjoyed
it
when
she
went
cowering
out
of
but
there
was
a
certain
glow
and
quietness
about
her
that
made
him
glad
when
he
was
alone
in
the
he
found
himself
tumultuously
happy
and
the
people
exceedingly
nice
and
the
night
lovely
and
everything
good
morel
was
sitting
reading
when
he
got
home
her
health
was
not
good
now
and
there
had
come
that
ivory
pallor
into
her
face
which
he
never
noticed
and
which
afterwards
he
never
forgot
she
did
not
mention
her
own
to
him
after
all
she
thought
it
was
not
much
you
are
late
she
said
looking
at
him
his
eyes
were
shining
his
face
seemed
to
glow
he
smiled
to
her
yes
i
been
down
clifton
grove
with
his
mother
looked
at
him
again
but
wo
people
talk
she
said
why
they
know
she
a
suffragette
and
so
on
and
what
if
they
do
talk
of
course
there
may
be
nothing
wrong
in
it
said
his
mother
but
you
know
what
folks
are
and
if
once
she
gets
talked
about
well
i
ca
help
it
their
jaw
is
so
almighty
important
after
i
think
you
ought
to
consider
so
i
do
what
can
people
say
that
we
take
a
walk
together
i
believe
you
you
know
i
should
be
glad
if
she
were
a
married
well
my
dear
she
lives
separate
from
her
husband
and
talks
on
platforms
so
she
already
singled
out
from
the
sheep
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
has
much
to
lose
no
her
life
nothing
to
her
so
the
worth
of
nothing
she
goes
with
me
it
becomes
something
then
she
must
pay
we
both
must
pay
folk
are
so
frightened
of
paying
rather
starve
and
very
well
my
son
we
see
how
it
will
very
well
my
mother
i
abide
by
the
we
see
and
she
she
awfully
nice
mother
she
is
really
you
do
know
that
not
the
same
as
marrying
it
perhaps
there
was
silence
for
a
while
he
wanted
to
ask
his
mother
something
but
was
afraid
should
you
like
to
know
her
he
hesitated
yes
said
morel
coolly
i
should
like
to
know
what
she
but
she
nice
mother
she
is
and
not
a
bit
common
i
never
suggested
she
but
you
seem
to
think
she
not
as
good
as
she
better
than
folk
out
of
a
hundred
i
tell
you
she
better
she
is
she
fair
she
honest
she
straight
there
is
anything
underhand
or
superior
about
her
do
be
mean
about
her
morel
flushed
i
am
sure
i
am
not
mean
about
her
she
may
be
quite
as
you
say
but
you
do
approve
he
finished
and
do
you
expect
me
to
she
answered
coldly
yes
yes
if
you
anything
about
you
you
be
glad
do
you
want
to
see
her
i
said
i
then
i
bring
her
shall
i
bring
her
here
you
please
then
i
will
bring
her
here
one
sunday
to
tea
if
you
think
a
horrid
thing
about
her
i
sha
forgive
his
mother
laughed
as
if
it
would
make
any
difference
she
said
he
knew
he
had
won
oh
but
it
feels
so
fine
when
she
there
she
such
a
queen
in
her
occasionally
he
still
walked
a
little
way
from
chapel
with
miriam
and
edgar
he
did
not
go
up
to
the
farm
she
however
was
very
much
the
same
with
him
and
he
did
not
feel
embarrassed
in
her
presence
one
evening
she
was
alone
when
he
accompanied
her
they
began
by
talking
books
it
was
their
unfailing
topic
morel
had
said
that
his
and
miriam
affair
was
like
a
fire
fed
on
books
if
there
were
no
more
volumes
it
would
die
out
miriam
for
her
part
boasted
that
she
could
read
him
like
a
book
could
place
her
finger
any
minute
on
the
chapter
and
the
line
he
easily
taken
in
believed
that
miriam
knew
more
about
him
than
anyone
else
so
it
pleased
him
to
talk
to
her
about
himself
like
the
simplest
egoist
very
soon
the
conversation
drifted
to
his
own
doings
it
flattered
him
immensely
that
he
was
of
such
supreme
interest
and
what
have
you
been
doing
lately
i
oh
not
much
i
made
a
sketch
of
bestwood
from
the
garden
that
is
nearly
right
at
last
it
the
hundredth
so
they
went
on
then
she
said
you
not
been
out
then
lately
yes
i
went
up
clifton
grove
on
monday
afternoon
with
it
was
not
very
nice
weather
said
miriam
was
it
but
i
wanted
to
go
out
and
it
was
all
right
the
trent
is
and
did
you
go
to
barton
she
asked
no
we
had
tea
in
did
you
that
would
be
it
was
the
jolliest
old
woman
she
gave
us
several
pompom
dahlias
as
pretty
as
you
miriam
bowed
her
head
and
brooded
he
was
quite
unconscious
of
concealing
anything
from
her
what
made
her
give
them
you
she
asked
he
laughed
because
she
liked
us
because
we
were
jolly
i
should
miriam
put
her
finger
in
her
mouth
were
you
late
home
she
asked
at
last
he
resented
her
tone
i
caught
the
ha
they
walked
on
in
silence
and
he
was
angry
and
how
is
clara
asked
miriam
quite
all
right
i
that
good
she
said
with
a
tinge
of
irony
by
the
way
what
of
her
husband
one
never
hears
anything
of
he
got
some
other
woman
and
is
also
quite
all
right
he
replied
at
least
so
i
i
see
you
do
know
for
certain
do
you
think
a
position
like
that
is
hard
on
a
woman
rottenly
hard
it
so
unjust
said
miriam
the
man
does
as
he
likes
then
let
the
woman
also
he
said
how
can
she
and
if
she
does
look
at
her
position
what
of
it
why
it
impossible
you
do
understand
what
a
woman
forfeits
no
i
do
but
if
a
woman
got
nothing
but
her
fair
fame
to
feed
on
why
it
thin
tack
and
a
donkey
would
die
of
it
so
she
understood
his
moral
attitude
at
least
and
she
knew
he
would
act
accordingly
she
never
asked
him
anything
direct
but
she
got
to
know
enough
another
day
when
he
saw
miriam
the
conversation
turned
to
marriage
then
to
clara
marriage
with
dawes
you
see
he
said
she
never
knew
the
fearful
importance
of
marriage
she
thought
it
was
all
in
the
day
march
it
would
have
to
come
and
dawes
well
a
good
many
women
would
have
given
their
souls
to
get
him
so
why
not
him
then
she
developed
into
the
femme
incomprise
and
treated
him
badly
i
bet
my
and
she
left
him
because
he
did
understand
her
i
suppose
so
i
suppose
she
had
to
it
is
altogether
a
question
of
understanding
it
a
question
of
living
with
him
she
was
only
the
rest
was
dormant
deadened
and
the
dormant
woman
was
the
femme
incomprise
and
she
had
to
be
and
what
about
i
do
know
i
rather
think
he
loves
her
as
much
as
he
can
but
he
a
it
was
something
like
your
mother
and
father
said
miriam
yes
but
my
mother
i
believe
got
real
joy
and
satisfaction
out
of
my
father
at
first
i
believe
she
had
a
passion
for
him
that
why
she
stayed
with
him
after
all
they
were
bound
to
each
yes
said
miriam
that
what
one
must
have
i
think
he
continued
the
real
real
flame
of
feeling
through
another
person
once
only
once
if
it
only
lasts
three
months
see
my
mother
looks
as
if
she
had
everything
that
was
necessary
for
her
living
and
developing
there
not
a
tiny
bit
of
feeling
of
sterility
about
no
said
miriam
and
with
my
father
at
first
i
sure
she
had
the
real
thing
she
knows
she
has
been
there
you
can
feel
it
about
her
and
about
him
and
about
hundreds
of
people
you
meet
every
day
and
once
it
has
happened
to
you
you
can
go
on
with
anything
and
what
happened
exactly
asked
miriam
it
so
hard
to
say
but
the
something
big
and
intense
that
changes
you
when
you
really
come
together
with
somebody
else
it
almost
seems
to
fertilise
your
soul
and
make
it
that
you
can
go
on
and
and
you
think
your
mother
had
it
with
your
father
yes
and
at
the
bottom
she
feels
grateful
to
him
for
giving
it
her
even
now
though
they
are
miles
and
you
think
clara
never
had
it
i
miriam
pondered
this
she
saw
what
he
was
seeking
a
sort
of
baptism
of
fire
in
passion
it
seemed
to
her
she
realised
that
he
would
never
be
satisfied
till
he
had
it
perhaps
it
was
essential
to
him
as
to
some
men
to
sow
wild
oats
and
afterwards
when
he
was
satisfied
he
would
not
rage
with
restlessness
any
more
but
could
settle
down
and
give
her
his
life
into
her
hands
well
then
if
he
must
go
let
him
go
and
have
his
fill
something
big
and
intense
he
called
it
at
any
rate
when
he
had
got
it
he
would
not
want
it
that
he
said
himself
he
would
want
the
other
thing
that
she
could
give
him
he
would
want
to
be
owned
so
that
he
could
work
it
seemed
to
her
a
bitter
thing
that
he
must
go
but
she
could
let
him
go
into
an
inn
for
a
glass
of
whisky
so
she
could
let
him
go
to
clara
so
long
as
it
was
something
that
would
satisfy
a
need
in
him
and
leave
him
free
for
herself
to
possess
have
you
told
your
mother
about
clara
she
asked
she
knew
this
would
be
a
test
of
the
seriousness
of
his
feeling
for
the
other
woman
she
knew
he
was
going
to
clara
for
something
vital
not
as
a
man
goes
for
pleasure
to
a
prostitute
if
he
told
his
mother
yes
he
said
and
she
is
coming
to
tea
on
to
your
house
yes
i
want
mater
to
see
ah
there
was
a
silence
things
had
gone
quicker
than
she
thought
she
felt
a
sudden
bitterness
that
he
could
leave
her
so
soon
and
so
entirely
and
was
clara
to
be
accepted
by
his
people
who
had
been
so
hostile
to
herself
i
may
call
in
as
i
go
to
chapel
she
said
it
is
a
long
time
since
i
saw
very
well
he
said
astonished
and
unconsciously
angry
on
the
sunday
afternoon
he
went
to
keston
to
meet
clara
at
the
station
as
he
stood
on
the
platform
he
was
trying
to
examine
in
himself
if
he
had
a
premonition
do
i
feel
as
if
she
come
he
said
to
himself
and
he
tried
to
find
out
his
heart
felt
queer
and
contracted
that
seemed
like
foreboding
then
he
had
a
foreboding
she
would
not
come
then
she
would
not
come
and
instead
of
taking
her
over
the
fields
home
as
he
had
imagined
he
would
have
to
go
alone
the
train
was
late
the
afternoon
would
be
wasted
and
the
evening
he
hated
her
for
not
coming
why
had
she
promised
then
if
she
could
not
keep
her
promise
perhaps
she
had
missed
her
train
he
himself
was
always
missing
trains
but
that
was
no
reason
why
she
should
miss
this
particular
one
he
was
angry
with
her
he
was
furious
suddenly
he
saw
the
train
crawling
sneaking
round
the
corner
here
then
was
the
train
but
of
course
she
had
not
come
the
green
engine
hissed
along
the
platform
the
row
of
brown
carriages
drew
up
several
doors
opened
no
she
had
not
come
no
yes
ah
there
she
was
she
had
a
big
black
hat
on
he
was
at
her
side
in
a
moment
i
thought
you
were
coming
he
said
she
was
laughing
rather
breathlessly
as
she
put
out
her
hand
to
him
their
eyes
met
he
took
her
quickly
along
the
platform
talking
at
a
great
rate
to
hide
his
feeling
she
looked
beautiful
in
her
hat
were
large
silk
roses
coloured
like
tarnished
gold
her
costume
of
dark
cloth
fitted
so
beautifully
over
her
breast
and
shoulders
his
pride
went
up
as
he
walked
with
her
he
felt
the
station
people
who
knew
him
eyed
her
with
awe
and
admiration
i
was
sure
you
were
coming
he
laughed
shakily
she
laughed
in
answer
almost
with
a
little
cry
and
i
wondered
when
i
was
in
the
train
whatever
i
should
do
if
you
were
there
she
said
he
caught
her
hand
impulsively
and
they
went
along
the
narrow
twitchel
they
took
the
road
into
nuttall
and
over
the
reckoning
house
farm
it
was
a
blue
mild
day
everywhere
the
brown
leaves
lay
scattered
many
scarlet
hips
stood
upon
the
hedge
beside
the
wood
he
gathered
a
few
for
her
to
wear
though
really
he
said
as
he
fitted
them
into
the
breast
of
her
coat
you
ought
to
object
to
my
getting
them
because
of
the
birds
but
they
do
care
much
for
in
this
part
where
they
can
get
plenty
of
stuff
you
often
find
the
berries
going
rotten
in
the
so
he
chattered
scarcely
aware
of
what
he
said
only
knowing
he
was
putting
berries
in
the
bosom
of
her
coat
while
she
stood
patiently
for
him
and
she
watched
his
quick
hands
so
full
of
life
and
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
never
seen
anything
before
till
now
everything
had
been
indistinct
they
came
near
to
the
colliery
it
stood
quite
still
and
black
among
the
its
immense
heap
of
slag
seen
rising
almost
from
the
oats
what
a
pity
there
is
a
here
where
it
is
so
pretty
said
clara
do
you
think
so
he
answered
you
see
i
am
so
used
to
it
i
should
miss
it
no
and
i
like
the
pits
here
and
there
i
like
the
rows
of
trucks
and
the
headstocks
and
the
steam
in
the
daytime
and
the
lights
at
night
when
i
was
a
boy
i
always
thought
a
pillar
of
cloud
by
day
and
a
pillar
of
fire
by
night
was
a
pit
with
its
steam
and
its
lights
and
the
burning
bank
and
i
thought
the
lord
was
always
at
the
as
they
drew
near
home
she
walked
in
silence
and
seemed
to
hang
back
he
pressed
her
fingers
in
his
own
she
flushed
but
gave
no
response
do
you
want
to
come
home
he
asked
yes
i
want
to
come
she
replied
it
did
not
occur
to
him
that
her
position
in
his
home
would
be
rather
a
peculiar
and
difficult
one
to
him
it
seemed
just
as
if
one
of
his
men
friends
were
going
to
be
introduced
to
his
mother
only
nicer
the
morels
lived
in
a
house
in
an
ugly
street
that
ran
down
a
steep
hill
the
street
itself
was
hideous
the
house
was
rather
superior
to
most
it
was
old
grimy
with
a
big
bay
window
and
it
was
but
it
looked
gloomy
then
paul
opened
the
door
to
the
garden
and
all
was
different
the
sunny
afternoon
was
there
like
another
land
by
the
path
grew
tansy
and
little
trees
in
front
of
the
window
was
a
plot
of
sunny
grass
with
old
lilacs
round
it
and
away
went
the
garden
with
heaps
of
dishevelled
chrysanthemums
in
the
sunshine
down
to
the
and
the
field
and
beyond
one
looked
over
a
few
cottages
to
the
hills
with
all
the
glow
of
the
autumn
afternoon
morel
sat
in
her
wearing
her
black
silk
blouse
her
hair
was
taken
smooth
back
from
her
brow
and
her
high
temples
her
face
was
rather
pale
clara
suffering
followed
paul
into
the
kitchen
morel
rose
clara
thought
her
a
lady
even
rather
stiff
the
young
woman
was
very
nervous
she
had
almost
a
wistful
look
almost
resigned
mother
clara
said
paul
morel
held
out
her
hand
and
smiled
he
has
told
me
a
good
deal
about
you
she
said
the
blood
flamed
in
clara
cheek
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
coming
she
faltered
i
was
pleased
when
he
said
he
would
bring
you
replied
morel
paul
watching
felt
his
heart
contract
with
pain
his
mother
looked
so
small
and
sallow
and
beside
the
luxuriant
clara
it
such
a
pretty
day
mother
he
said
and
we
saw
a
his
mother
looked
at
him
he
had
turned
to
her
she
thought
what
a
man
he
seemed
in
his
dark
clothes
he
was
pale
and
it
would
be
hard
for
any
woman
to
keep
him
her
heart
glowed
then
she
was
sorry
for
clara
perhaps
you
leave
your
things
in
the
parlour
said
morel
nicely
to
the
young
woman
oh
thank
you
she
replied
come
on
said
paul
and
he
led
the
way
into
the
little
front
room
with
its
old
piano
its
mahogany
furniture
its
yellowing
marble
mantelpiece
a
fire
was
burning
the
place
was
littered
with
books
and
i
leave
my
things
lying
about
he
said
it
so
much
she
loved
his
artist
paraphernalia
and
the
books
and
the
photos
of
people
soon
he
was
telling
her
this
was
william
this
was
young
lady
in
the
evening
dress
this
was
annie
and
her
husband
this
was
arthur
and
his
wife
and
the
baby
she
felt
as
if
she
were
being
taken
into
the
family
he
showed
her
photos
books
sketches
and
they
talked
a
little
while
then
they
returned
to
the
kitchen
morel
put
aside
her
book
clara
wore
a
blouse
of
fine
silk
chiffon
with
narrow
stripes
her
hair
was
done
simply
coiled
on
top
of
her
head
she
looked
rather
stately
and
reserved
you
have
gone
to
live
down
sneinton
boulevard
said
morel
when
i
was
a
girl
girl
i
say
when
i
was
a
young
woman
we
lived
in
minerva
oh
did
you
said
clara
i
have
a
friend
in
number
and
the
conversation
had
started
they
talked
nottingham
and
nottingham
people
it
interested
them
both
clara
was
still
rather
nervous
morel
was
still
somewhat
on
her
dignity
she
clipped
her
language
very
clear
and
precise
but
they
were
going
to
get
on
well
together
paul
saw
morel
measured
herself
against
the
younger
woman
and
found
herself
easily
stronger
clara
was
deferential
she
knew
paul
surprising
regard
for
his
mother
and
she
had
dreaded
the
meeting
expecting
someone
rather
hard
and
cold
she
was
surprised
to
find
this
little
interested
woman
chatting
with
such
readiness
and
then
she
felt
as
she
felt
with
paul
that
she
would
not
care
to
stand
in
morel
way
there
was
something
so
hard
and
certain
in
his
mother
as
if
she
never
had
a
misgiving
in
her
life
presently
morel
came
down
ruffled
and
yawning
from
his
afternoon
sleep
he
scratched
his
grizzled
head
he
plodded
in
his
stocking
feet
his
waistcoat
hung
open
over
his
shirt
he
seemed
incongruous
this
is
dawes
father
said
paul
then
morel
pulled
himself
together
clara
saw
paul
manner
of
bowing
and
shaking
hands
oh
indeed
exclaimed
morel
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
i
am
i
assure
you
but
do
disturb
yourself
no
no
make
yourself
quite
comfortable
and
be
very
clara
was
astonished
at
this
flood
of
hospitality
from
the
old
collier
he
was
so
courteous
so
gallant
she
thought
him
most
delightful
and
may
you
have
come
far
he
asked
only
from
nottingham
she
said
from
nottingham
then
you
have
had
a
beautiful
day
for
your
then
he
strayed
into
the
scullery
to
wash
his
hands
and
face
and
from
force
of
habit
came
on
to
the
hearth
with
the
towel
to
dry
himself
at
tea
clara
felt
the
refinement
and
of
the
household
morel
was
perfectly
at
her
ease
the
pouring
out
the
tea
and
attending
to
the
people
went
on
unconsciously
without
interrupting
her
in
her
talk
there
was
a
lot
of
room
at
the
oval
table
the
china
of
dark
blue
looked
pretty
on
the
glossy
cloth
there
was
a
little
bowl
of
small
yellow
chrysanthemums
clara
felt
she
completed
the
circle
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
her
but
she
was
rather
afraid
of
the
of
the
morels
father
and
all
she
took
their
tone
there
was
a
feeling
of
balance
it
was
a
cool
clear
atmosphere
where
everyone
was
himself
and
in
harmony
clara
enjoyed
it
but
there
was
a
fear
deep
at
the
bottom
of
her
paul
cleared
the
table
whilst
his
mother
and
clara
talked
clara
was
conscious
of
his
quick
vigorous
body
as
it
came
and
went
seeming
blown
quickly
by
a
wind
at
its
work
it
was
almost
like
the
hither
and
thither
of
a
leaf
that
comes
unexpected
most
of
herself
went
with
him
by
the
way
she
leaned
forward
as
if
listening
morel
could
see
she
was
possessed
elsewhere
as
she
talked
and
again
the
elder
woman
was
sorry
for
her
having
finished
he
strolled
down
the
garden
leaving
the
two
women
to
talk
it
was
a
hazy
sunny
afternoon
mild
and
soft
clara
glanced
through
the
window
after
him
as
he
loitered
among
the
chrysanthemums
she
felt
as
if
something
almost
tangible
fastened
her
to
him
yet
he
seemed
so
easy
in
his
graceful
indolent
movement
so
detached
as
he
tied
up
the
flower
branches
to
their
stakes
that
she
wanted
to
shriek
in
her
helplessness
morel
rose
you
will
let
me
help
you
wash
up
said
clara
eh
there
are
so
few
it
will
only
take
a
minute
said
the
other
clara
however
dried
the
and
was
glad
to
be
on
such
good
terms
with
his
mother
but
it
was
torture
not
to
be
able
to
follow
him
down
the
garden
at
last
she
allowed
herself
to
go
she
felt
as
if
a
rope
were
taken
off
her
ankle
the
afternoon
was
golden
over
the
hills
of
derbyshire
he
stood
across
in
the
other
garden
beside
a
bush
of
pale
michaelmas
daisies
watching
the
last
bees
crawl
into
the
hive
hearing
her
coming
he
turned
to
her
with
an
easy
motion
saying
it
the
end
of
the
run
with
these
clara
stood
near
him
over
the
low
red
wall
in
front
was
the
country
and
the
hills
all
golden
dim
at
that
moment
miriam
was
entering
through
the
she
saw
clara
go
up
to
him
saw
him
turn
and
saw
them
come
to
rest
together
something
in
their
perfect
isolation
together
made
her
know
that
it
was
accomplished
between
them
that
they
were
as
she
put
it
married
she
walked
very
slowly
down
the
of
the
long
garden
clara
had
pulled
a
button
from
a
hollyhock
spire
and
was
breaking
it
to
get
the
seeds
above
her
bowed
head
the
pink
flowers
stared
as
if
defending
her
the
last
bees
were
falling
down
to
the
hive
count
your
money
laughed
paul
as
she
broke
the
flat
seeds
one
by
one
from
the
roll
of
coin
she
looked
at
him
i
well
off
she
said
smiling
how
much
pf
he
snapped
his
fingers
can
i
turn
them
into
gold
i
afraid
not
she
laughed
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
laughing
at
that
moment
they
became
aware
of
miriam
there
was
a
click
and
everything
had
altered
hello
miriam
he
exclaimed
you
said
you
come
yes
had
you
forgotten
she
shook
hands
with
clara
saying
it
seems
strange
to
see
you
yes
replied
the
other
it
seems
strange
to
be
there
was
a
hesitation
this
is
pretty
is
it
said
miriam
i
like
it
very
much
replied
clara
then
miriam
realised
that
clara
was
accepted
as
she
had
never
been
have
you
come
down
alone
asked
paul
yes
i
went
to
agatha
to
tea
we
are
going
to
chapel
i
only
called
in
for
a
moment
to
see
you
should
have
come
in
here
to
tea
he
said
miriam
laughed
shortly
and
clara
turned
impatiently
aside
do
you
like
the
chrysanthemums
he
asked
yes
they
are
very
fine
replied
miriam
which
sort
do
you
like
best
he
asked
i
do
know
the
bronze
i
i
do
think
you
seen
all
the
sorts
come
and
look
come
and
see
which
are
your
favourites
he
led
the
two
women
back
to
his
own
garden
where
the
towsled
bushes
of
flowers
of
all
colours
stood
raggedly
along
the
path
down
to
the
field
the
situation
did
not
embarrass
him
to
his
knowledge
look
miriam
these
are
the
white
ones
that
came
from
your
garden
they
are
so
fine
here
are
they
no
said
miriam
but
they
hardier
you
so
sheltered
things
grow
big
and
tender
and
then
die
these
little
yellow
ones
i
like
will
you
have
some
while
they
were
out
there
the
bells
began
to
ring
in
the
church
sounding
loud
across
the
town
and
the
field
miriam
looked
at
the
tower
proud
among
the
clustering
roofs
and
remembered
the
sketches
he
had
brought
her
it
had
been
different
then
but
he
had
not
left
her
even
yet
she
asked
him
for
a
book
to
read
he
ran
indoors
what
is
that
miriam
asked
his
mother
coldly
yes
she
said
she
call
and
see
you
told
her
then
came
the
sarcastic
answer
yes
why
should
i
there
certainly
no
reason
why
you
should
said
morel
and
she
returned
to
her
book
he
winced
from
his
mother
irony
frowned
irritably
thinking
why
ca
i
do
as
i
like
you
not
seen
morel
before
miriam
was
saying
to
clara
no
but
she
so
nice
yes
said
miriam
dropping
her
head
in
some
ways
she
very
i
should
think
had
paul
told
you
much
about
her
he
had
talked
a
good
ha
there
was
silence
until
he
returned
with
the
book
when
will
you
want
it
back
miriam
asked
when
you
like
he
answered
clara
turned
to
go
indoors
whilst
he
accompanied
miriam
to
the
gate
when
will
you
come
up
to
willey
farm
the
latter
asked
i
could
say
replied
clara
mother
asked
me
to
say
she
be
pleased
to
see
you
any
time
if
you
cared
to
thank
you
i
should
like
to
but
i
ca
say
oh
very
well
exclaimed
miriam
rather
bitterly
turning
away
she
went
down
the
path
with
her
mouth
to
the
flowers
he
had
given
her
you
sure
you
wo
come
in
he
said
no
we
are
going
to
ah
i
shall
see
you
then
miriam
was
very
bitter
they
parted
he
felt
guilty
towards
her
she
was
bitter
and
she
scorned
him
he
still
belonged
to
herself
she
believed
yet
he
could
have
clara
take
her
home
sit
with
her
next
his
mother
in
chapel
give
her
the
same
he
had
given
herself
years
before
she
heard
him
running
quickly
indoors
but
he
did
not
go
straight
in
halting
on
the
plot
of
grass
he
heard
his
mother
voice
then
clara
answer
what
i
hate
is
the
bloodhound
quality
in
yes
said
his
mother
quickly
yes
does
it
make
you
hate
her
now
his
heart
went
hot
and
he
was
angry
with
them
for
talking
about
the
girl
what
right
had
they
to
say
that
something
in
the
speech
itself
stung
him
into
a
flame
of
hate
against
miriam
then
his
own
heart
rebelled
furiously
at
clara
taking
the
liberty
of
speaking
so
about
miriam
after
all
the
girl
was
the
better
woman
of
the
two
he
thought
if
it
came
to
goodness
he
went
indoors
his
mother
looked
excited
she
was
beating
with
her
hand
rhythmically
on
the
as
women
do
who
are
wearing
out
he
could
never
bear
to
see
the
movement
there
was
a
silence
then
he
began
to
talk
in
chapel
miriam
saw
him
find
the
place
in
the
for
clara
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
he
used
for
herself
and
during
the
sermon
he
could
see
the
girl
across
the
chapel
her
hat
throwing
a
dark
shadow
over
her
face
what
did
she
think
seeing
clara
with
him
he
did
not
stop
to
consider
he
felt
himself
cruel
towards
miriam
after
chapel
he
went
over
pentrich
with
clara
it
was
a
dark
autumn
night
they
had
said
to
miriam
and
his
heart
had
smitten
him
as
he
left
the
girl
alone
but
it
serves
her
right
he
said
inside
himself
and
it
almost
gave
him
pleasure
to
go
off
under
her
eyes
with
this
other
handsome
woman
there
was
a
scent
of
damp
leaves
in
the
darkness
clara
hand
lay
warm
and
inert
in
his
own
as
they
walked
he
was
full
of
conflict
the
battle
that
raged
inside
him
made
him
feel
desperate
up
pentrich
hill
clara
leaned
against
him
as
he
went
he
slid
his
arm
round
her
waist
feeling
the
strong
motion
of
her
body
under
his
arm
as
she
walked
the
tightness
in
his
chest
because
of
miriam
relaxed
and
the
hot
blood
bathed
him
he
held
her
closer
and
closer
then
you
still
keep
on
with
miriam
she
said
quietly
only
talk
there
never
was
a
great
deal
more
than
talk
between
us
he
said
bitterly
your
mother
does
care
for
her
said
clara
no
or
i
might
have
married
her
but
it
all
up
really
suddenly
his
voice
went
passionate
with
hate
if
i
was
with
her
now
we
should
be
jawing
about
the
mystery
or
some
such
tack
thank
god
i
not
they
walked
on
in
silence
for
some
time
but
you
ca
really
give
her
up
said
clara
i
do
give
her
up
because
there
nothing
to
give
he
said
there
is
for
i
do
know
why
she
and
i
should
be
friends
as
long
as
we
live
he
said
but
it
only
be
clara
drew
away
from
him
leaning
away
from
contact
with
him
what
are
you
drawing
away
for
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
but
drew
farther
from
him
why
do
you
want
to
walk
alone
he
asked
still
there
was
no
answer
she
walked
resentfully
hanging
her
head
because
i
said
i
would
be
friends
with
miriam
he
exclaimed
she
would
not
answer
him
anything
i
tell
you
it
only
words
that
go
between
us
he
persisted
trying
to
take
her
again
she
resisted
suddenly
he
strode
across
in
front
of
her
barring
her
way
damn
it
he
said
what
do
you
want
now
you
better
run
after
miriam
mocked
clara
the
blood
flamed
up
in
him
he
stood
showing
his
teeth
she
drooped
sulkily
the
lane
was
dark
quite
lonely
he
suddenly
caught
her
in
his
arms
stretched
forward
and
put
his
mouth
on
her
face
in
a
kiss
of
rage
she
turned
frantically
to
avoid
him
he
held
her
fast
hard
and
relentless
his
mouth
came
for
her
her
breasts
hurt
against
the
wall
of
his
chest
helpless
she
went
loose
in
his
arms
and
he
kissed
her
and
kissed
her
he
heard
people
coming
down
the
hill
stand
up
stand
up
he
said
thickly
gripping
her
arm
till
it
hurt
if
he
had
let
go
she
would
have
sunk
to
the
ground
she
sighed
and
walked
dizzily
beside
him
they
went
on
in
silence
we
will
go
over
the
fields
he
said
and
then
she
woke
up
but
she
let
herself
be
helped
over
the
stile
and
she
walked
in
silence
with
him
over
the
first
dark
field
it
was
the
way
to
nottingham
and
to
the
station
she
knew
he
seemed
to
be
looking
about
they
came
out
on
a
bare
hilltop
where
stood
the
dark
figure
of
the
ruined
windmill
there
he
halted
they
stood
together
high
up
in
the
darkness
looking
at
the
lights
scattered
on
the
night
before
them
handfuls
of
glittering
points
villages
lying
high
and
low
on
the
dark
here
and
there
like
treading
among
the
stars
he
said
with
a
quaky
laugh
then
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
held
her
fast
she
moved
aside
her
mouth
to
ask
dogged
and
low
what
time
is
it
it
does
matter
he
pleaded
thickly
yes
it
does
yes
i
must
go
it
early
yet
he
said
what
time
is
it
she
insisted
all
round
lay
the
black
night
speckled
and
spangled
with
lights
i
do
she
put
her
hand
on
his
chest
feeling
for
his
watch
he
felt
the
joints
fuse
into
fire
she
groped
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
while
he
stood
panting
in
the
darkness
she
could
see
the
round
pale
face
of
the
watch
but
not
the
figures
she
stooped
over
it
he
was
panting
till
he
could
take
her
in
his
arms
again
i
ca
see
she
said
then
do
yes
i
going
she
said
turning
away
wait
i
look
but
he
could
not
see
i
strike
a
he
secretly
hoped
it
was
too
late
to
catch
the
train
she
saw
the
glowing
lantern
of
his
hands
as
he
cradled
the
light
then
his
face
lit
up
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
watch
instantly
all
was
dark
again
all
was
black
before
her
eyes
only
a
glowing
match
was
red
near
her
feet
where
was
he
what
is
it
she
asked
afraid
you
ca
do
it
his
voice
answered
out
of
the
darkness
there
was
a
pause
she
felt
in
his
power
she
had
heard
the
ring
in
his
voice
it
frightened
her
what
time
is
it
she
asked
quiet
definite
hopeless
two
minutes
to
nine
he
replied
telling
the
truth
with
a
struggle
and
can
i
get
from
here
to
the
station
in
fourteen
minutes
no
at
any
rate
she
could
distinguish
his
dark
form
again
a
yard
or
so
away
she
wanted
to
escape
but
ca
i
do
it
she
pleaded
if
you
hurry
he
said
brusquely
but
you
could
easily
walk
it
clara
it
only
seven
miles
to
the
tram
i
come
with
no
i
want
to
catch
the
but
why
i
do
i
want
to
catch
the
suddenly
his
voice
altered
very
well
he
said
dry
and
hard
come
along
and
he
plunged
ahead
into
the
darkness
she
ran
after
him
wanting
to
cry
now
he
was
hard
and
cruel
to
her
she
ran
over
the
rough
dark
fields
behind
him
out
of
breath
ready
to
drop
but
the
double
row
of
lights
at
the
station
drew
nearer
suddenly
there
she
is
he
cried
breaking
into
a
run
there
was
a
faint
rattling
noise
away
to
the
right
the
train
like
a
luminous
caterpillar
was
threading
across
the
night
the
rattling
ceased
she
over
the
viaduct
you
just
do
clara
ran
quite
out
of
breath
and
fell
at
last
into
the
train
the
whistle
blew
he
was
gone
gone
and
she
was
in
a
carriage
full
of
people
she
felt
the
cruelty
of
it
he
turned
round
and
plunged
home
before
he
knew
where
he
was
he
was
in
the
kitchen
at
home
he
was
very
pale
his
eyes
were
dark
and
as
if
he
were
drunk
his
mother
looked
at
him
well
i
must
say
your
boots
are
in
a
nice
state
she
said
he
looked
at
his
feet
then
he
took
off
his
overcoat
his
mother
wondered
if
he
were
drunk
she
caught
the
train
then
she
said
i
hope
her
feet
were
so
filthy
where
on
earth
you
dragged
her
i
do
know
he
was
silent
and
motionless
for
some
time
did
you
like
her
he
asked
grudgingly
at
last
yes
i
liked
her
but
you
tire
of
her
my
son
you
know
you
he
did
not
answer
she
noticed
how
he
laboured
in
his
breathing
have
you
been
running
she
asked
we
had
to
run
for
the
you
go
and
knock
yourself
up
you
better
drink
hot
it
was
as
good
a
stimulant
as
he
could
have
but
he
refused
and
went
to
bed
there
he
lay
face
down
on
the
counterpane
and
shed
tears
of
rage
and
pain
there
was
a
physical
pain
that
made
him
bite
his
lips
till
they
bled
and
the
chaos
inside
him
left
him
unable
to
think
almost
to
feel
this
is
how
she
serves
me
is
it
he
said
in
his
heart
over
and
over
pressing
his
face
in
the
quilt
and
he
hated
her
again
he
went
over
the
scene
and
again
he
hated
her
the
next
day
there
was
a
new
aloofness
about
him
clara
was
very
gentle
almost
loving
but
he
treated
her
distantly
with
a
touch
of
contempt
she
sighed
continuing
to
be
gentle
he
came
round
one
evening
of
that
week
sarah
bernhardt
was
at
the
theatre
royal
in
nottingham
giving
la
dame
aux
camelias
paul
wanted
to
see
this
old
and
famous
actress
and
he
asked
clara
to
accompany
him
he
told
his
mother
to
leave
the
key
in
the
window
for
him
shall
i
book
seats
he
asked
of
clara
yes
and
put
on
an
evening
suit
will
you
i
never
seen
you
in
but
good
lord
clara
think
of
me
in
evening
suit
at
the
theatre
he
remonstrated
would
you
rather
not
she
asked
i
will
if
you
want
me
to
but
i
s
feel
a
she
laughed
at
him
then
feel
a
fool
for
my
sake
once
wo
you
the
request
made
his
blood
flush
up
i
suppose
i
s
have
what
are
you
taking
a
suitcase
for
his
mother
asked
he
blushed
furiously
clara
asked
me
he
said
and
what
seats
are
you
going
in
circle
each
well
i
sure
exclaimed
his
mother
sarcastically
it
only
once
in
the
bluest
of
blue
moons
he
said
he
dressed
at
jordan
put
on
an
overcoat
and
a
cap
and
met
clara
in
a
cafe
she
was
with
one
of
her
suffragette
friends
she
wore
an
old
long
coat
which
did
not
suit
her
and
had
a
little
wrap
over
her
head
which
he
hated
the
three
went
to
the
theatre
together
clara
took
off
her
coat
on
the
stairs
and
he
discovered
she
was
in
a
sort
of
dress
that
left
her
arms
and
neck
and
part
of
her
breast
bare
her
hair
was
done
fashionably
the
dress
a
simple
thing
of
green
crape
suited
her
she
looked
quite
grand
he
thought
he
could
see
her
figure
inside
the
frock
as
if
that
were
wrapped
closely
round
her
the
firmness
and
the
softness
of
her
upright
body
could
almost
be
felt
as
he
looked
at
her
he
clenched
his
fists
and
he
was
to
sit
all
the
evening
beside
her
beautiful
naked
arm
watching
the
strong
throat
rise
from
the
strong
chest
watching
the
breasts
under
the
green
stuff
the
curve
of
her
limbs
in
the
tight
dress
something
in
him
hated
her
again
for
submitting
him
to
this
torture
of
nearness
and
he
loved
her
as
she
balanced
her
head
and
stared
straight
in
front
of
her
pouting
wistful
immobile
as
if
she
yielded
herself
to
her
fate
because
it
was
too
strong
for
her
she
could
not
help
herself
she
was
in
the
grip
of
something
bigger
than
herself
a
kind
of
eternal
look
about
her
as
if
she
were
a
wistful
sphinx
made
it
necessary
for
him
to
kiss
her
he
dropped
his
programme
and
crouched
down
on
the
floor
to
get
it
so
that
he
could
kiss
her
hand
and
wrist
her
beauty
was
a
torture
to
him
she
sat
immobile
only
when
the
lights
went
down
she
sank
a
little
against
him
and
he
caressed
her
hand
and
arm
with
his
fingers
he
could
smell
her
faint
perfume
all
the
time
his
blood
kept
sweeping
up
in
great
waves
that
killed
his
consciousness
momentarily
the
drama
continued
he
saw
it
all
in
the
distance
going
on
somewhere
he
did
not
know
where
but
it
seemed
far
away
inside
him
he
was
white
heavy
arms
her
throat
her
moving
bosom
that
seemed
to
be
himself
then
away
somewhere
the
play
went
on
and
he
was
identified
with
that
also
there
was
no
himself
the
grey
and
black
eyes
of
clara
her
bosom
coming
down
on
him
her
arm
that
he
held
gripped
between
his
hands
were
all
that
existed
then
he
felt
himself
small
and
helpless
her
towering
in
her
force
above
him
only
the
intervals
when
the
lights
came
up
hurt
him
expressibly
he
wanted
to
run
anywhere
so
long
as
it
would
be
dark
again
in
a
maze
he
wandered
out
for
a
drink
then
the
lights
were
out
and
the
strange
insane
reality
of
clara
and
the
drama
took
hold
of
him
again
the
play
went
on
but
he
was
obsessed
by
the
desire
to
kiss
the
tiny
blue
vein
that
nestled
in
the
bend
of
her
arm
he
could
feel
it
his
whole
face
seemed
suspended
till
he
had
put
his
lips
there
it
must
be
done
and
the
other
people
at
last
he
bent
quickly
forward
and
touched
it
with
his
lips
his
moustache
brushed
the
sensitive
flesh
clara
shivered
drew
away
her
arm
when
all
was
over
the
lights
up
the
people
clapping
he
came
to
himself
and
looked
at
his
watch
his
train
was
gone
i
s
have
to
walk
home
he
said
clara
looked
at
him
it
is
too
late
she
asked
he
nodded
then
he
helped
her
on
with
her
coat
i
love
you
you
look
beautiful
in
that
dress
he
murmured
over
her
shoulder
among
the
throng
of
bustling
people
she
remained
quiet
together
they
went
out
of
the
theatre
he
saw
the
cabs
waiting
the
people
passing
it
seemed
he
met
a
pair
of
brown
eyes
which
hated
him
but
he
did
not
know
he
and
clara
turned
away
mechanically
taking
the
direction
to
the
station
the
train
had
gone
he
would
have
to
walk
the
ten
miles
home
it
does
matter
he
said
i
shall
enjoy
wo
you
she
said
flushing
come
home
for
the
night
i
can
sleep
with
he
looked
at
her
their
eyes
met
what
will
your
mother
say
he
asked
she
wo
you
sure
quite
shall
i
come
if
you
very
and
they
turned
away
at
the
first
they
took
the
car
the
wind
blew
fresh
in
their
faces
the
town
was
dark
the
tram
tipped
in
its
haste
he
sat
with
her
hand
fast
in
his
will
your
mother
be
gone
to
bed
he
asked
she
may
be
i
hope
they
hurried
along
the
silent
dark
little
street
the
only
people
out
of
doors
clara
quickly
entered
the
house
he
hesitated
he
leaped
up
the
step
and
was
in
the
room
her
mother
appeared
in
the
inner
doorway
large
and
hostile
who
have
you
got
there
she
asked
it
morel
he
has
missed
his
train
i
thought
we
might
put
him
up
for
the
night
and
save
him
a
h
exclaimed
radford
that
your
lookout
if
you
invited
him
he
very
welcome
as
far
as
i
concerned
you
keep
the
house
if
you
do
like
me
i
go
away
again
he
said
nay
nay
you
need
come
along
in
i
dunno
what
you
think
of
the
supper
i
got
it
was
a
little
dish
of
chip
potatoes
and
a
piece
of
bacon
the
table
was
roughly
laid
for
one
you
can
have
some
more
bacon
continued
radford
more
chips
you
ca
it
a
shame
to
bother
you
he
said
oh
do
you
be
apologetic
it
does
do
wi
me
you
treated
her
to
the
theatre
did
you
there
was
a
sarcasm
in
the
last
question
well
laughed
paul
uncomfortably
well
and
what
an
inch
of
bacon
take
your
coat
the
big
woman
was
trying
to
estimate
the
situation
she
moved
about
the
cupboard
clara
took
his
coat
the
room
was
very
warm
and
cosy
in
the
lamplight
my
sirs
exclaimed
radford
but
you
two
a
pair
of
bright
beauties
i
must
say
what
all
that
for
i
believe
we
do
know
he
said
feeling
a
victim
there
is
room
in
this
house
for
two
such
if
you
fly
your
kites
that
high
she
rallied
them
it
was
a
nasty
thrust
he
in
his
dinner
jacket
and
clara
in
her
green
dress
and
bare
arms
were
confused
they
felt
they
must
shelter
each
other
in
that
little
kitchen
and
look
at
that
blossom
continued
radford
pointing
to
clara
what
does
she
reckon
she
did
it
for
paul
looked
at
clara
she
was
rosy
her
neck
was
warm
with
blushes
there
was
a
moment
of
silence
you
like
to
see
it
do
you
he
asked
the
mother
had
them
in
her
power
all
the
time
his
heart
was
beating
hard
and
he
was
tight
with
anxiety
but
he
would
fight
her
me
like
to
see
it
exclaimed
the
old
woman
what
should
i
like
to
see
her
make
a
fool
of
herself
for
i
seen
people
look
bigger
fools
he
said
clara
was
under
his
protection
now
oh
ay
and
when
was
that
came
the
sarcastic
rejoinder
when
they
made
frights
of
themselves
he
answered
radford
large
and
threatening
stood
suspended
on
the
hearthrug
holding
her
fork
they
fools
either
road
she
answered
at
length
turning
to
the
dutch
oven
no
he
said
fighting
stoutly
folk
ought
to
look
as
well
as
they
and
do
you
call
that
looking
nice
cried
the
mother
pointing
a
scornful
fork
at
clara
that
that
looks
as
if
it
was
properly
dressed
i
believe
you
jealous
that
you
ca
swank
as
well
he
said
laughing
me
i
could
have
worn
evening
dress
with
anybody
if
i
wanted
to
came
the
scornful
answer
and
why
did
you
want
to
he
asked
pertinently
or
did
you
wear
it
there
was
a
long
pause
radford
readjusted
the
bacon
in
the
dutch
oven
his
heart
beat
fast
for
fear
he
had
offended
her
me
she
exclaimed
at
last
no
i
did
and
when
i
was
in
service
i
knew
as
soon
as
one
of
the
maids
came
out
in
bare
shoulders
what
sort
she
was
going
to
her
sixpenny
hop
were
you
too
good
to
go
to
a
sixpenny
hop
he
said
clara
sat
with
bowed
head
his
eyes
were
dark
and
glittering
radford
took
the
dutch
oven
from
the
fire
and
stood
near
him
putting
bits
of
bacon
on
his
plate
there
a
nice
crozzly
bit
she
said
do
give
me
the
best
he
said
she
got
what
she
wants
was
the
answer
there
was
a
sort
of
scornful
forbearance
in
the
woman
tone
that
made
paul
know
she
was
mollified
but
do
have
some
he
said
to
clara
she
looked
up
at
him
with
her
grey
eyes
humiliated
and
lonely
no
thanks
she
said
why
wo
you
he
answered
carelessly
the
blood
was
beating
up
like
fire
in
his
veins
radford
sat
down
again
large
and
impressive
and
aloof
he
left
clara
altogether
to
attend
to
the
mother
they
say
sarah
bernhardt
fifty
he
said
fifty
she
turned
sixty
came
the
scornful
answer
well
he
said
you
never
think
it
she
made
me
want
to
howl
even
i
should
like
to
see
myself
howling
at
that
bad
old
baggage
said
radford
it
time
she
began
to
think
herself
a
grandmother
not
a
shrieking
catamaran
he
laughed
a
catamaran
is
a
boat
the
malays
use
he
said
and
it
a
word
as
i
use
she
retorted
my
mother
does
sometimes
and
it
no
good
my
telling
her
he
said
i
s
think
she
boxes
your
ears
said
radford
she
like
to
and
she
says
she
will
so
i
give
her
a
little
stool
to
stand
that
the
worst
of
my
mother
said
clara
she
never
wants
a
stool
for
but
she
often
ca
touch
that
lady
with
a
long
prop
retorted
radford
to
paul
i
s
think
she
does
want
touching
with
a
prop
he
laughed
i
it
might
do
the
pair
of
you
good
to
give
you
a
crack
on
the
head
with
one
said
the
mother
laughing
suddenly
why
are
you
so
vindictive
towards
me
he
said
i
not
stolen
anything
from
no
i
watch
that
laughed
the
older
woman
soon
the
supper
was
finished
radford
sat
guard
in
her
chair
paul
lit
a
cigarette
clara
went
upstairs
returning
with
a
which
she
spread
on
the
fender
to
air
why
i
forgot
all
about
them
said
radford
where
have
they
sprung
from
out
of
my
h
you
bought
for
baxter
an
he
would
wear
would
he
laughing
said
he
reckoned
to
do
trousers
i
she
turned
confidentially
to
paul
saying
he
could
bear
them
pyjama
the
young
man
sat
making
rings
of
smoke
well
it
everyone
to
his
taste
he
laughed
then
followed
a
little
discussion
of
the
merits
of
pyjamas
my
mother
loves
me
in
them
he
said
she
says
i
a
i
can
imagine
they
suit
you
said
radford
after
a
while
he
glanced
at
the
little
clock
that
was
ticking
on
the
mantelpiece
it
was
twelve
it
is
funny
he
said
but
it
takes
hours
to
settle
down
to
sleep
after
the
it
about
time
you
did
said
radford
clearing
the
table
are
you
tired
he
asked
of
clara
not
the
least
bit
she
answered
avoiding
his
eyes
shall
we
have
a
game
at
cribbage
he
said
i
forgotten
well
i
teach
you
again
may
we
play
crib
radford
he
asked
you
please
yourselves
she
said
but
it
pretty
a
game
or
so
will
make
us
sleepy
he
answered
clara
brought
the
cards
and
sat
spinning
her
whilst
he
shuffled
them
radford
was
washing
up
in
the
scullery
as
it
grew
later
paul
felt
the
situation
getting
more
and
more
tense
fifteen
two
fifteen
four
fifteen
six
and
two
eight
the
clock
struck
one
still
the
game
continued
radford
had
done
all
the
little
jobs
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
had
locked
the
door
and
filled
the
kettle
still
paul
went
on
dealing
and
counting
he
was
obsessed
by
clara
arms
and
throat
he
believed
he
could
see
where
the
division
was
just
beginning
for
her
breasts
he
could
not
leave
her
she
watched
his
hands
and
felt
her
joints
melt
as
they
moved
quickly
she
was
so
near
it
was
almost
as
if
he
touched
her
and
yet
not
quite
his
mettle
was
roused
he
hated
radford
she
sat
on
nearly
dropping
asleep
but
determined
and
obstinate
in
her
chair
paul
glanced
at
her
then
at
clara
she
met
his
eyes
that
were
angry
mocking
and
hard
as
steel
her
own
answered
him
in
shame
he
knew
she
at
any
rate
was
of
his
mind
he
played
on
at
last
radford
roused
herself
stiffly
and
said
is
it
nigh
on
time
you
two
was
thinking
o
bed
paul
played
on
without
answering
he
hated
her
sufficiently
to
murder
her
half
a
minute
he
said
the
elder
woman
rose
and
sailed
stubbornly
into
the
scullery
returning
with
his
candle
which
she
put
on
the
mantelpiece
then
she
sat
down
again
the
hatred
of
her
went
so
hot
down
his
veins
he
dropped
his
cards
we
stop
then
he
said
but
his
voice
was
still
a
challenge
clara
saw
his
mouth
shut
hard
again
he
glanced
at
her
it
seemed
like
an
agreement
she
bent
over
the
cards
coughing
to
clear
her
throat
well
i
glad
you
finished
said
radford
here
take
your
things
she
thrust
the
warm
suit
in
his
hand
and
this
is
your
candle
your
room
over
this
there
only
two
so
you
ca
go
far
wrong
well
i
hope
you
rest
i
sure
i
shall
i
always
do
he
said
yes
and
so
you
ought
at
your
age
she
replied
he
bade
to
clara
and
went
the
twisting
stairs
of
white
scrubbed
wood
creaked
and
clanged
at
every
step
he
went
doggedly
the
two
doors
faced
each
other
he
went
in
his
room
pushed
the
door
to
without
fastening
the
latch
it
was
a
small
room
with
a
large
bed
some
of
clara
were
on
the
her
her
clothes
and
some
skirts
hung
under
a
cloth
in
a
corner
there
was
actually
a
pair
of
stockings
over
a
chair
he
explored
the
room
two
books
of
his
own
were
there
on
the
shelf
he
undressed
folded
his
suit
and
sat
on
the
bed
listening
then
he
blew
out
the
candle
lay
down
and
in
two
minutes
was
almost
asleep
then
click
he
was
wide
awake
and
writhing
in
torment
it
was
as
if
when
he
had
nearly
got
to
sleep
something
had
bitten
him
suddenly
and
sent
him
mad
he
sat
up
and
looked
at
the
room
in
the
darkness
his
feet
doubled
under
him
perfectly
motionless
listening
he
heard
a
cat
somewhere
away
outside
then
the
heavy
poised
tread
of
the
mother
then
clara
distinct
voice
will
you
unfasten
my
dress
there
was
silence
for
some
time
at
last
the
mother
said
now
then
are
you
coming
up
no
not
yet
replied
the
daughter
calmly
oh
very
well
then
if
it
not
late
enough
stop
a
bit
longer
only
you
need
come
waking
me
up
when
i
got
to
i
sha
be
long
said
clara
immediately
afterwards
paul
heard
the
mother
slowly
mounting
the
stairs
the
candlelight
flashed
through
the
cracks
in
his
door
her
dress
brushed
the
door
and
his
heart
jumped
then
it
was
dark
and
he
heard
the
clatter
of
her
latch
she
was
very
leisurely
indeed
in
her
preparations
for
sleep
after
a
long
time
it
was
quite
still
he
sat
strung
up
on
the
bed
shivering
slightly
his
door
was
an
inch
open
as
clara
came
upstairs
he
would
intercept
her
he
waited
all
was
dead
silence
the
clock
struck
two
then
he
heard
a
slight
scrape
of
the
fender
downstairs
now
he
could
not
help
himself
his
shivering
was
uncontrollable
he
felt
he
must
go
or
die
he
stepped
off
the
bed
and
stood
a
moment
shuddering
then
he
went
straight
to
the
door
he
tried
to
step
lightly
the
first
stair
cracked
like
a
shot
he
listened
the
old
woman
stirred
in
her
bed
the
staircase
was
dark
there
was
a
slit
of
light
under
the
door
which
opened
into
the
kitchen
he
stood
a
moment
then
he
went
on
mechanically
every
step
creaked
and
his
back
was
creeping
lest
the
old
woman
door
should
open
behind
him
up
above
he
fumbled
with
the
door
at
the
bottom
the
latch
opened
with
a
loud
clack
he
went
through
into
the
kitchen
and
shut
the
door
noisily
behind
him
the
old
woman
dare
come
now
then
he
stood
arrested
clara
was
kneeling
on
a
pile
of
white
underclothing
on
the
hearthrug
her
back
towards
him
warming
herself
she
did
not
look
round
but
sat
crouching
on
her
heels
and
her
rounded
beautiful
back
was
towards
him
and
her
face
was
hidden
she
was
warming
her
body
at
the
fire
for
consolation
the
glow
was
rosy
on
one
side
the
shadow
was
dark
and
warm
on
the
other
her
arms
hung
slack
he
shuddered
violently
clenching
his
teeth
and
fists
hard
to
keep
control
then
he
went
forward
to
her
he
put
one
hand
on
her
shoulder
the
fingers
of
the
other
hand
under
her
chin
to
raise
her
face
a
convulsed
shiver
ran
through
her
once
twice
at
his
touch
she
kept
her
head
bent
sorry
he
murmured
realising
that
his
hands
were
very
cold
then
she
looked
up
at
him
frightened
like
a
thing
that
is
afraid
of
death
my
hands
are
so
cold
he
murmured
i
like
it
she
whispered
closing
her
eyes
the
breath
of
her
words
were
on
his
mouth
her
arms
clasped
his
knees
the
cord
of
his
dangled
against
her
and
made
her
shiver
as
the
warmth
went
into
him
his
shuddering
became
less
at
length
unable
to
stand
so
any
more
he
raised
her
and
she
buried
her
head
on
his
shoulder
his
hands
went
over
her
slowly
with
an
infinite
tenderness
of
caress
she
clung
close
to
him
trying
to
hide
herself
against
him
he
clasped
her
very
fast
then
at
last
she
looked
at
him
mute
imploring
looking
to
see
if
she
must
be
ashamed
his
eyes
were
dark
very
deep
and
very
quiet
it
was
as
if
her
beauty
and
his
taking
it
hurt
him
made
him
sorrowful
he
looked
at
her
with
a
little
pain
and
was
afraid
he
was
so
humble
before
her
she
kissed
him
fervently
on
the
eyes
first
one
then
the
other
and
she
folded
herself
to
him
she
gave
herself
he
held
her
fast
it
was
a
moment
intense
almost
to
agony
she
stood
letting
him
adore
her
and
tremble
with
joy
of
her
it
healed
her
hurt
pride
it
healed
her
it
made
her
glad
it
made
her
feel
erect
and
proud
again
her
pride
had
been
wounded
inside
her
she
had
been
cheapened
now
she
radiated
with
joy
and
pride
again
it
was
her
restoration
and
her
recognition
then
he
looked
at
her
his
face
radiant
they
laughed
to
each
other
and
he
strained
her
to
his
chest
the
seconds
ticked
off
the
minutes
passed
and
still
the
two
stood
clasped
rigid
together
mouth
to
mouth
like
a
statue
in
one
block
but
again
his
fingers
went
seeking
over
her
restless
wandering
dissatisfied
the
hot
blood
came
up
wave
upon
wave
she
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
come
you
to
my
room
he
murmured
she
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
her
mouth
pouting
disconsolately
her
eyes
heavy
with
passion
he
watched
her
fixedly
yes
he
said
again
she
shook
her
head
why
not
he
asked
she
looked
at
him
still
heavily
sorrowfully
and
again
she
shook
her
head
his
eyes
hardened
and
he
gave
way
when
later
on
he
was
back
in
bed
he
wondered
why
she
had
refused
to
come
to
him
openly
so
that
her
mother
would
know
at
any
rate
then
things
would
have
been
definite
and
she
could
have
stayed
with
him
the
night
without
having
to
go
as
she
was
to
her
mother
bed
it
was
strange
and
he
could
not
understand
it
and
then
almost
immediately
he
fell
asleep
he
awoke
in
the
morning
with
someone
speaking
to
him
opening
his
eyes
he
saw
radford
big
and
stately
looking
down
on
him
she
held
a
cup
of
tea
in
her
hand
do
you
think
you
going
to
sleep
till
doomsday
she
said
he
laughed
at
once
it
ought
only
to
be
about
five
he
said
well
she
answered
it
seven
whether
or
not
here

a
cup
of
he
rubbed
his
face
pushed
the
tumbled
hair
off
his
forehead
and
roused
himself
what
it
so
late
for
he
grumbled
he
resented
being
wakened
it
amused
her
she
saw
his
neck
in
the
flannel
as
white
and
round
as
a
girl
he
rubbed
his
hair
crossly
it
no
good

scratching

said

impudence

as

went
out
of
the
bedroom
i
only
a
fool
i
am
clara
was
very
quiet
at
breakfast
but
she
had
a
sort
of
air
of
proprietorship
over
him
that
pleased
him
infinitely
radford
was
evidently
fond
of
him
he
began
to
talk
of
his
painting
what
the
good
exclaimed
the
mother
of
your
whittling
and
worrying

twistin

baxter
dawes
soon
after
paul
had
been
to
the
theatre
with
clara
he
was
drinking
in
the
punch
bowl
with
some
friends
of
his
when
dawes
came
in
husband
was
growing
stout
his
eyelids
were
getting
slack
over
his
brown
eyes
he
was
losing
his
healthy
firmness
of
flesh
he
was
very
evidently
on
the
downward
track
having
quarrelled
with
his
sister
he
had
gone
into
cheap
lodgings
his
mistress
had
left
him
for
a
man
who
would
marry
her
he
had
been
in
prison
one
night
for
fighting
when
he
was
drunk
and
there
was
a
shady
betting
episode
in
which
he
was
concerned
paul
and
he
were
confirmed
enemies
and
yet
there
was
between
them
that
peculiar
feeling
of
intimacy
as
if
they
were
secretly
near
to
each
other
which
sometimes
exists
between
two
people
although
they
never
speak
to
one
another
paul
often
thought
of
baxter
dawes
often
wanted
to
get
at
him
and
be
friends
with
him
he
knew
that
dawes
often
thought
about
him
and
that
the
man
was
drawn
to
him
by
some
bond
or
other
and
yet
the
two
never
looked
at
each
other
save
in
hostility
since
he
was
a
superior
employee
at
jordan
it
was
the
thing
for
paul
to
offer
dawes
a
drink
what
you
have
he
asked
of
him
nowt
wi
a
bleeder
like
you
replied
the
man
paul
turned
away
with
a
slight
disdainful
movement
of
the
shoulders
very
irritating
the
aristocracy
he
continued
is
really
a
military
institution
take
germany
now
she
got
thousands
of
aristocrats
whose
only
means
of
existence
is
the
army
they
deadly
poor
and
life
deadly
slow
so
they
hope
for
a
war
they
look
for
war
as
a
chance
of
getting
on
till
there
a
war
they
are
idle
when
there
a
war
they
are
leaders
and
commanders
there
you
are
then
they
want
war
he
was
not
a
favourite
debater
in
the
being
too
quick
and
overbearing
he
irritated
the
older
men
by
his
assertive
manner
and
his
cocksureness
they
listened
in
silence
and
were
not
sorry
when
he
finished
dawes
interrupted
the
young
man
flow
of
eloquence
by
asking
in
a
loud
sneer
did
you
learn
all
that
at
th
theatre
th
other
night
paul
looked
at
him
their
eyes
met
then
he
knew
dawes
had
seen
him
coming
out
of
the
theatre
with
clara
why
what
about
th
theatre
asked
one
of
paul
associates
glad
to
get
a
dig
at
the
young
fellow
and
sniffing

golden
moustache

his
fingers

the
mutual

account

from
dawes
he
said
you
should
funk
your
own
deeds
man
remonstrated
the
friend
then
dawes
made
a
remark
which
caused
paul
to
throw
half
a
glass
of
beer
in
his
face
oh
morel
cried
the
barmaid
and
she
rang
the
bell
for
the
dawes
spat
and
rushed
for
the
young
man
at
that
minute
a
brawny
fellow
with
his
rolled
up
and
his
trousers
tight
over
his
haunches
intervened
now
then
he
said
pushing
his
chest
in
front
of
dawes
come
out
cried
dawes
paul
was
leaning
white
and
quivering
against
the
brass
rail
of
the
bar
he
hated
dawes
wished
something
could
exterminate
him
at
that
minute
and
at
the
same
time
seeing
the
wet
hair
on
the
man
forehead
he
thought
he
looked
pathetic
he
did
not
move
come
out

said
dawes
that
enough
dawes
cried
the
barmaid
come
on
said
the
with
kindly
insistence
you
better
be
getting
and
by
making
dawes
edge
away
from
his
own
close
proximity
he
worked
him
to
the
door
that
the
little
sod
as
started
it
cried
dawes
pointing
to
paul
morel
why
what
a
story

said
the
barmaid
you
know
it
was
you
all
the
still
the
kept
thrusting
his
chest
forward
at
him
still
he
kept
edging
back
until
he
was
in
the
doorway
and
on
the
steps
outside
then
he
turned
round
all
right
he
said
nodding
straight
at
his
rival
paul
had
a
curious
sensation
of
pity
almost
of
affection
mingled
with
violent
hate
for
the
man
the
coloured
door
swung
to
there
was
silence
in
the
bar
serve
him
jolly
well
right
said
the
barmaid
but
it
a
nasty
thing
to

a
glass
of
beer

the
mutual
friend

the
barmaid

give
you
a
turn
or
two
said
the
friend
thanks
i
have
and
presently
he
took
his
departure
go
along
with
him
jenkinson
whispered
the
barmaid
tipping
jenkinson
the
wink
the
man
nodded
took
his
hat
said
all
very
heartily
and
followed
paul
calling
half
a
minute
old
man
you
an
me
going
the
same
road
i
mr
morel
does
like
it
said
the
barmaid
you
see
we
have
him
in
much
more
i
sorry
he
good
company
and
baxter
dawes
wants
locking
up
that
what
he
paul
would
have
died
rather
than
his
mother
should
get
to
know
of
this
affair
he
suffered
tortures
of
humiliation
and
there
was
now
a
good
deal
of
his
life
of
which
necessarily
he
could
not
speak
to
his
mother
he
had
a
life
apart
from
her
his
sexual
life
the
rest
she
still
kept
but
he
felt
he
had
to
conceal
something
from
her
and
it
irked
him
there
was
a
certain
silence
between
them
and
he
felt
he
had
in
that
silence
to
defend
himself
against
her
he
felt
condemned
by
her
then
sometimes
he
hated
her
and
pulled
at
her
bondage
his
life
wanted
to
free
itself
of
her
it
was
like
a
circle
where
life
turned
back
on
itself
and
got
no
farther
she
bore
him
loved
him
kept
him
and
his
love
turned
back
into
her
so
that
he
could
not
be
free
to
go
forward
with
his
own
life
really
love
another
woman
at
this
period
unknowingly
he
resisted
his
mother
influence
he
did
not
tell
her
things
there
was
a
distance
between
them
clara
was
happy
almost
sure
of
him
she
felt
she
had
at
last
got
him
for
herself
and
then
again
came
the
uncertainty
he
told
her
jestingly
of
the
affair
with
her
husband
her
colour
came
up
her
grey
eyes
flashed
that
him
to
a
she
cried
like
a
navvy
he
not
fit
for
mixing
with
decent
yet
you
married
him
he
said
it
made
her
furious
that
he
reminded
her
i
did
she
cried
but
how
was
i
to
know
i
think
he
might
have
been
rather
nice
he
said
you
think
i
made
him
what
he
is
she
exclaimed
oh
no
he
made
himself
but
there
something
about
him
clara
looked
at
her
lover
closely
there
was
something
in
him
she
hated
a
sort
of
detached
criticism
of
herself
a
coldness
which
made
her
woman
soul
harden
against
him
and
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
how
about
there
nothing
to
do
is
there
he
replied
you
can
fight
him
if
you
have
to
i
suppose
she
said
no
i
have
the
least
sense
of
the
it
funny
with
most
men
there
the
instinct
to
clench
the
fist
and
hit
it
not
so
with
me
i
should
want
a
knife
or
a
pistol
or
something
to
fight
then
you
better
carry
something
she
said
nay
he
laughed
i
not
but
he
do
something
to
you
you
do
know
all
right
he
said
we
and
you
let
him
perhaps
if
i
ca
help
and
if
he
kills
you
she
said
i
should
be
sorry
for
his
sake
and
clara
was
silent
for
a
moment
you
do
make
me
angry
she
exclaimed
that
nothing
afresh
he
laughed
but
why
are
you
so
silly
you
do
know
and
do
yes
but
you
not
going
to
let
a
man
do
as
he
likes
with
you
what
must
i
do
he
replied
laughing
i
should
carry
a
revolver
she
said
i
sure
he
i
might
blow
my
fingers
off
he
said
no
but
wo
you
she
pleaded
not
anything
and
you
leave
him
to
you
are
a
fool
fact
she
set
her
teeth
with
anger
i
could
shake
you
she
cried
trembling
with
passion
why
let
a
man
like
him
do
as
he
likes
with
you
can
go
back
to
him
if
he
triumphs
he
said
do
you
want
me
to
hate
you
she
asked
well
i
only
tell
you
he
said
and
you
say
you
love
me
she
exclaimed
low
and
indignant
ought
i
to
slay
him
to
please
you
he
said
but
if
i
did
see
what
a
hold
he
have
over
do
you
think
i
a
fool
she
exclaimed
not
at
all
but
you
do
understand
me
my
there
was
a
pause
between
them
but
you
ought
not
to
expose
yourself
she
pleaded
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
man
in
righteousness
arrayed
the
pure
and
blameless
liver
needs
not
the
keen
toledo
blade
nor
quiver
he
quoted
she
looked
at
him
searchingly
i
wish
i
could
understand
you
she
said
there
simply
nothing
to
understand
he
laughed
she
bowed
her
head
brooding
he
did
not
see
dawes
for
several
days
then
one
morning
as
he
ran
upstairs
from
the
spiral
room
he
almost
collided
with
the
burly
what
the
cried
the
smith
sorry
said
paul
and
passed
on
sorry
sneered
dawes
paul
whistled
lightly
put
me
among
the
girls
i
stop
your
whistle
my
jockey
he
said
the
other
took
no
notice
you
goin
to
answer
for
that
job
of
the
other
paul
went
to
his
desk
in
his
corner
and
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
ledger
go
and
tell
fanny
i
want
order
quick
he
said
to
his
boy
dawes
stood
in
the
doorway
tall
and
threatening
looking
at
the
top
of
the
young
man
head
six
and
five
eleven
and
seven
paul
added
aloud
an
you

said
dawes
five
and
ninepence
he
wrote
a
figure
what
that
he
said
i
going
to
show
you
what
it
is
said
the
smith
the
other
went
on
adding
the
figures
aloud
yer
crawlin
little
yer
dares
face
me
proper
paul
quickly
snatched
the
heavy
ruler
dawes
started
the
young
man
ruled
some
lines
in
his
ledger
the
elder
man
was
infuriated
but
wait
till
i
light
on
you
no
matter
where
it
is
i
settle
your
hash
for
a
bit
yer
little
swine
all
right
said
paul
at
that
the
smith
started
heavily
from
the
doorway
just
then
a
whistle
piped
shrilly
paul
went
to
the
yes
he
said
and
he
listened
er
yes
he
listened
then
he
laughed
i
come
down
directly
i
got
a
visitor
just
dawes
knew
from
his
tone
that
he
had
been
speaking
to
clara
he
stepped
forward
yer
little
devil
he
said
i
visitor
you
inside
of
two
minutes
think
i
goin
to
have

round
the
other
clerks
in
the
warehouse

up
paul
appeared
holding
some
white
article
fanny
says
you
could
have
had
it
last
night
if
you
let
her
know
he
said
all
right
answered
paul
looking
at
the
stocking
get
it
dawes
stood
frustrated
helpless
with
rage
morel
turned
round
excuse
me
a
minute
he
said
to
dawes
and
he
would
have
run
downstairs
by
god
i
stop
your
gallop
shouted
the
smith
seizing
him
by
the
arm
he
turned
quickly
hey
hey
cried
the
alarmed
thomas
jordan
started
out
of
his
little
glass
office
and
came
running
down
the
room
what
what
he
said
in
his
old
man
sharp
voice
i
just
goin
ter
settle
this
little
that
all
said
dawes
desperately
what
do
you
mean
snapped
thomas
jordan
what
i
say
said
dawes
but
he
hung
fire
morel
was
leaning
against
the
counter
ashamed
what
it
all
about
snapped
thomas
jordan
could
say
said
paul
shaking
his
head
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
could
yer
could
yer
cried
dawes
thrusting
forward
his
handsome
furious
face
and
squaring
his
fist
have
you
finished
cried
the
old
man
strutting
get
off
about
your
business
and
do
come
here
tipsy
in
the
dawes
turned
his
big
frame
slowly
upon
him
tipsy
he
said
who
tipsy
i
no
more
tipsy
than
you
are
we
heard
that
song
before
snapped
the
old
man
now
you
get
off
and
do
be
long
about
it
comin
here
with
your
the
smith
looked
down
contemptuously
on
his
employer
his
hands
large
and
grimy
and
yet
well
shaped
for
his
labour
worked
restlessly
paul
remembered
they
were
the
hands
of
clara
husband
and
a
flash
of
hate
went
through
him
get
out
before
you
turned
out
snapped
thomas
jordan
why
who
turn
me
out
said
dawes
beginning
to
sneer
jordan
started
marched
up
to
the
smith
waving
him
off
thrusting
his
stout
little
figure
at
the
man
saying
get
off
my
premises
get
off
he
seized
and
twitched
dawes
arm
come
off
said
the
smith
and
with
a
jerk
of
the
elbow
he
sent
the
little
manufacturer
staggering
backwards
before
anyone
could
help
him
thomas
jordan
had
collided
with
the
flimsy
it
had
given
way
and
let
him
crash
down
the
steps
into
fanny
room
there
was
a
second
of
amazement
then
men
and
girls
were
running
dawes
stood
a
moment
looking
bitterly
on
the
scene
then
he
took
his
departure
thomas
jordan
was
shaken
and
braised
not
otherwise
hurt
he
was
however
beside
himself
with
rage
he
dismissed
dawes
from
his
employment
and
summoned
him
for
assault
at
the
trial
paul
morel
had
to
give
evidence
asked
how
the
trouble
began
he
said
dawes
took
occasion
to
insult
dawes
and
me
because
i
accompanied
her
to
the
theatre
one
evening
then
i
threw
some
beer
at
him
and
he
wanted
his
la
femme
smiled
the
magistrate
the
case
was
dismissed
after
the
magistrate
had
told
dawes
he
thought
him
a
skunk
you
gave
the
case
away
snapped
jordan
to
paul
i
do
think
i
did
replied
the
latter
besides
you
did
really
want
a
conviction
did
you
what
do
you
think
i
took
the
case
up
for
well
said
paul
i
sorry
if
i
said
the
wrong
clara
was
also
very
angry
why
need
my
name
have
been
dragged
in
she
said
better
speak
it
openly
than
leave
it
to
be
there
was
no
need
for
anything
at
all
she
declared
we
are
none
the
poorer
he
said
indifferently
you
may
not
be
she
said
and
you
he
asked
i
need
never
have
been
i
sorry
he
said
but
he
did
not
sound
sorry
he
told
himself
easily
she
will
come
and
she
did
he
told
his
mother
about
the
fall
of
jordan
and
the
trial
of
dawes
morel
watched
him
closely
and
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
she
asked
him
i
think
he
a
fool
he
said
but
he
was
very
uncomfortable
nevertheless
have
you
ever
considered
where
it
will
end
his
mother
said
no
he
answered
things
work
out
of
they
do
in
a
way
one
does
like
as
a
rule
said
his
mother
and
then
one
has
to
put
up
with
them
he
said
you
find
you
not
as
good
at
up
as
you
imagine
she
said
he
went
on
working
rapidly
at
his
design
do
you
ever
ask
her
opinion
she
said
at
length
what
of
of
you
and
the
whole
i
do
care
what
her
opinion
of
me
is
she
fearfully
in
love
with
me
but
it
not
very
but
quite
as
deep
as
your
feeling
for
he
looked
up
at
his
mother
curiously
yes
he
said
you
know
mother
i
think
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
me
that
i
ca
love
when
she
there
as
a
rule
i
do
love
her
sometimes
when
i
see
her
just
as
the
woman
i
love
her
mother
but
then
when
she
talks
and
criticises
i
often
do
listen
to
yet
she
as
much
sense
as
perhaps
and
i
love
her
better
than
miriam
but
why
do
they
hold
me
the
last
question
was
almost
a
lamentation
his
mother
turned
away
her
face
sat
looking
across
the
room
very
quiet
grave
with
something
of
renunciation
but
you
would
want
to
marry
clara
she
said
no
at
first
perhaps
i
would
but
why
why
do
i
want
to
marry
her
or
anybody
i
feel
sometimes
as
if
i
wronged
my
women
how
wronged
them
my
son
i
do
he
went
on
painting
rather
despairingly
he
had
touched
the
quick
of
the
trouble
and
as
for
wanting
to
marry
said
his
mother
there
plenty
of
time
but
no
mother
i
even
love
clara
and
i
did
miriam
but
to
give
myself
to
them
in
marriage
i
could
i
could
belong
to
them
they
seem
to
want
me
and
i
ca
ever
give
it
you
have
met
the
right
and
i
never
shall
meet
the
right
woman
while
you
live
he
said
she
was
very
quiet
now
she
began
to
feel
again
tired
as
if
she
were
done
we
see
my
son
she
answered
the
feeling
that
things
were
going
in
a
circle
made
him
mad
clara
was
indeed
passionately
in
love
with
him
and
he
with
her
as
far
as
passion
went
in
the
daytime
he
forgot
her
a
good
deal
she
was
working
in
the
same
building
but
he
was
not
aware
of
it
he
was
busy
and
her
existence
was
of
no
matter
to
him
but
all
the
time
she
was
in
her
spiral
room
she
had
a
sense
that
he
was
upstairs
a
physical
sense
of
his
person
in
the
same
building
every
second
she
expected
him
to
come
through
the
door
and
when
he
came
it
was
a
shock
to
her
but
he
was
often
short
and
offhand
with
her
he
gave
her
his
directions
in
an
official
manner
keeping
her
at
bay
with
what
wits
she
had
left
she
listened
to
him
she
dared
not
misunderstand
or
fail
to
remember
but
it
was
a
cruelty
to
her
she
wanted
to
touch
his
chest
she
knew
exactly
how
his
breast
was
shapen
under
the
waistcoat
and
she
wanted
to
touch
it
it
maddened
her
to
hear
his
mechanical
voice
giving
orders
about
the
work
she
wanted
to
break
through
the
sham
of
it
smash
the
trivial
coating
of
business
which
covered
him
with
hardness
get
at
the
man
again
but
she
was
afraid
and
before
she
could
feel
one
touch
of
his
warmth
he
was
gone
and
she
ached
again
he
knew
that
she
was
dreary
every
evening
she
did
not
see
him
so
he
gave
her
a
good
deal
of
his
time
the
days
were
often
a
misery
to
her
but
the
evenings
and
the
nights
were
usually
a
bliss
to
them
both
then
they
were
silent
for
hours
they
sat
together
or
walked
together
in
the
dark
and
talked
only
a
few
almost
meaningless
words
but
he
had
her
hand
in
his
and
her
bosom
left
its
warmth
in
his
chest
making
him
feel
whole
one
evening
they
were
walking
down
by
the
canal
and
something
was
troubling
him
she
knew
she
had
not
got
him
all
the
time
he
whistled
softly
and
persistently
to
himself
she
listened
feeling
she
could
learn
more
from
his
whistling
than
from
his
speech
it
was
a
sad
dissatisfied
tune
a
tune
that
made
her
feel
he
would
not
stay
with
her
she
walked
on
in
silence
when
they
came
to
the
swing
bridge
he
sat
down
on
the
great
pole
looking
at
the
stars
in
the
water
he
was
a
long
way
from
her
she
had
been
thinking
will
you
always
stay
at
jordan
she
asked
no
he
answered
without
reflecting
no
i
s
leave
nottingham
and
go
abroad
go
abroad
what
for
i
dunno
i
feel
but
what
shall
you
do
i
shall
have
to
get
some
steady
designing
work
and
some
sort
of
sale
for
my
pictures
first
he
said
i
am
gradually
making
my
way
i
know
i
and
when
do
you
think
you
go
i
do
know
i
shall
hardly
go
for
long
while
there
my
you
could
leave
her
not
for
she
looked
at
the
stars
in
the
black
water
they
lay
very
white
and
staring
it
was
an
agony
to
know
he
would
leave
her
but
it
was
almost
an
agony
to
have
him
near
her
and
if
you
made
a
nice
lot
of
money
what
would
you
do
she
asked
go
somewhere
in
a
pretty
house
near
london
with
my
i
there
was
a
long
pause
i
could
still
come
and
see
you
he
said
i
do
know
do
ask
me
what
i
should
do
i
do
there
was
a
silence
the
stars
shuddered
and
broke
upon
the
water
there
came
a
breath
of
wind
he
went
suddenly
to
her
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
do
ask
me
anything
about
the
future
he
said
miserably
i
know
anything
be
with
me
now
will
you
no
matter
what
it
is
and
she
took
him
in
her
arms
after
all
she
was
a
married
woman
and
she
had
no
right
even
to
what
he
gave
her
he
needed
her
badly
she
had
him
in
her
arms
and
he
was
miserable
with
her
warmth
she
folded
him
over
consoled
him
loved
him
she
would
let
the
moment
stand
for
itself
after
a
moment
he
lifted
his
head
as
if
he
wanted
to
speak
clara
he
said
struggling
she
caught
him
passionately
to
her
pressed
his
head
down
on
her
breast
with
her
hand
she
could
not
bear
the
suffering
in
his
voice
she
was
afraid
in
her
soul
he
might
have
anything
of
her
anything
but
she
did
not
want
to
know
she
felt
she
could
not
bear
it
she
wanted
him
to
be
soothed
upon
her
soothed
she
stood
clasping
him
and
caressing
him
and
he
was
something
unknown
to
her
something
almost
uncanny
she
wanted
to
soothe
him
into
forgetfulness
and
soon
the
struggle
went
down
in
his
soul
and
he
forgot
but
then
clara
was
not
there
for
him
only
a
woman
warm
something
he
loved
and
almost
worshipped
there
in
the
dark
but
it
was
not
clara
and
she
submitted
to
him
the
naked
hunger
and
inevitability
of
his
loving
her
something
strong
and
blind
and
ruthless
in
its
primitiveness
made
the
hour
almost
terrible
to
her
she
knew
how
stark
and
alone
he
was
and
she
felt
it
was
great
that
he
came
to
her
and
she
took
him
simply
because
his
need
was
bigger
either
than
her
or
him
and
her
soul
was
still
within
her
she
did
this
for
him
in
his
need
even
if
he
left
her
for
she
loved
him
all
the
while
the
peewits
were
screaming
in
the
field
when
he
came
to
he
wondered
what
was
near
his
eyes
curving
and
strong
with
life
in
the
dark
and
what
voice
it
was
speaking
then
he
realised
it
was
the
grass
and
the
peewit
was
calling
the
warmth
was
clara
breathing
heaving
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
into
her
eyes
they
were
dark
and
shining
and
strange
life
wild
at
the
source
staring
into
his
life
stranger
to
him
yet
meeting
him
and
he
put
his
face
down
on
her
throat
afraid
what
was
she
a
strong
strange
wild
life
that
breathed
with
his
in
the
darkness
through
this
hour
it
was
all
so
much
bigger
than
themselves
that
he
was
hushed
they
had
met
and
included
in
their
meeting
the
thrust
of
the
manifold
grass
stems
the
cry
of
the
peewit
the
wheel
of
the
stars
when
they
stood
up
they
saw
other
lovers
stealing
down
the
opposite
hedge
it
seemed
natural
they
were
there
the
night
contained
them
and
after
such
an
evening
they
both
were
very
still
having
known
the
immensity
of
passion
they
felt
small
childish
and
wondering
like
adam
and
eve
when
they
lost
their
innocence
and
realised
the
magnificence
of
the
power
which
drove
them
out
of
paradise
and
across
the
great
night
and
the
great
day
of
humanity
it
was
for
each
of
them
an
initiation
and
a
satisfaction
to
know
their
own
nothingness
to
know
the
tremendous
living
flood
which
carried
them
always
gave
them
rest
within
themselves
if
so
great
a
magnificent
power
could
overwhelm
them
identify
them
altogether
with
itself
so
that
they
knew
they
were
only
grains
in
the
tremendous
heave
that
lifted
every
grass
blade
its
little
height
and
every
tree
and
living
thing
then
why
fret
about
themselves
they
could
let
themselves
be
carried
by
life
and
they
felt
a
sort
of
peace
each
in
the
other
there
was
a
verification
which
they
had
had
together
nothing
could
nullify
it
nothing
could
take
it
away
it
was
almost
their
belief
in
life
but
clara
was
not
satisfied
something
great
was
there
she
knew
something
great
enveloped
her
but
it
did
not
keep
her
in
the
morning
it
was
not
the
same
they
had
known
but
she
could
not
keep
the
moment
she
wanted
it
again
she
wanted
something
permanent
she
had
not
realised
fully
she
thought
it
was
he
whom
she
wanted
he
was
not
safe
to
her
this
that
had
been
between
them
might
never
be
again
he
might
leave
her
she
had
not
got
him
she
was
not
satisfied
she
had
been
there
but
she
had
not
gripped
the
the
something
she
knew
not
what
which
she
was
mad
to
have
in
the
morning
he
had
considerable
peace
and
was
happy
in
himself
it
seemed
almost
as
if
he
had
known
the
baptism
of
fire
in
passion
and
it
left
him
at
rest
but
it
was
not
clara
it
was
something
that
happened
because
of
her
but
it
was
not
her
they
were
scarcely
any
nearer
each
other
it
was
as
if
they
had
been
blind
agents
of
a
great
force
when
she
saw
him
that
day
at
the
factory
her
heart
melted
like
a
drop
of
fire
it
was
his
body
his
brows
the
drop
of
fire
grew
more
intense
in
her
breast
she
must
hold
him
but
he
very
quiet
very
subdued
this
morning
went
on
giving
his
instruction
she
followed
him
into
the
dark
ugly
basement
and
lifted
her
arms
to
him
he
kissed
her
and
the
intensity
of
passion
began
to
burn
him
again
somebody
was
at
the
door
he
ran
upstairs
she
returned
to
her
room
moving
as
if
in
a
trance
after
that
the
fire
slowly
went
down
he
felt
more
and
more
that
his
experience
had
been
impersonal
and
not
clara
he
loved
her
there
was
a
big
tenderness
as
after
a
strong
emotion
they
had
known
together
but
it
was
not
she
who
could
keep
his
soul
steady
he
had
wanted
her
to
be
something
she
could
not
be
and
she
was
mad
with
desire
of
him
she
could
not
see
him
without
touching
him
in
the
factory
as
he
talked
to
her
about
spiral
hose
she
ran
her
hand
secretly
along
his
side
she
followed
him
out
into
the
basement
for
a
quick
kiss
her
eyes
always
mute
and
yearning
full
of
unrestrained
passion
she
kept
fixed
on
his
he
was
afraid
of
her
lest
she
should
too
flagrantly
give
herself
away
before
the
other
girls
she
invariably
waited
for
him
at
dinnertime
for
him
to
embrace
her
before
she
went
he
felt
as
if
she
were
helpless
almost
a
burden
to
him
and
it
irritated
him
but
what
do
you
always
want
to
be
kissing
and
embracing
for
he
said
surely
there
a
time
for
she
looked
up
at
him
and
the
hate
came
into
her
eyes
do
i
always
want
to
be
kissing
you
she
said
always
even
if
i
come
to
ask
you
about
the
work
i
do
want
anything
to
do
with
love
when
i
at
work
work
work
and
what
is
love
she
asked
has
it
to
have
special
hours
yes
out
of
work
and
you
regulate
it
according
to
jordan
closing
time
yes
and
according
to
the
freedom
from
business
of
any
it
is
only
to
exist
in
spare
time
that
all
and
not
always
then
not
the
kissing
sort
of
and
that
all
you
think
of
it
it
quite
i
glad
you
think
and
she
was
cold
to
him
for
some
time
she
hated
him
and
while
she
was
cold
and
contemptuous
he
was
uneasy
till
she
had
forgiven
him
again
but
when
they
started
afresh
they
were
not
any
nearer
he
kept
her
because
he
never
satisfied
her
in
the
spring
they
went
together
to
the
seaside
they
had
rooms
at
a
little
cottage
near
theddlethorpe
and
lived
as
man
and
wife
radford
sometimes
went
with
them
it
was
known
in
nottingham
that
paul
morel
and
dawes
were
going
together
but
as
nothing
was
very
obvious
and
clara
always
a
solitary
person
and
he
seemed
so
simple
and
innocent
it
did
not
make
much
difference
he
loved
the
lincolnshire
coast
and
she
loved
the
sea
in
the
early
morning
they
often
went
out
together
to
bathe
the
grey
of
the
dawn
the
far
desolate
reaches
of
the
fenland
smitten
with
winter
the
rank
with
herbage
were
stark
enough
to
rejoice
his
soul
as
they
stepped
on
to
the
highroad
from
their
plank
bridge
and
looked
round
at
the
endless
monotony
of
levels
the
land
a
little
darker
than
the
sky
the
sea
sounding
small
beyond
the
sandhills
his
heart
filled
strong
with
the
sweeping
relentlessness
of
life
she
loved
him
then
he
was
solitary
and
strong
and
his
eyes
had
a
beautiful
light
they
shuddered
with
cold
then
he
raced
her
down
the
road
to
the
green
turf
bridge
she
could
run
well
her
colour
soon
came
her
throat
was
bare
her
eyes
shone
he
loved
her
for
being
so
luxuriously
heavy
and
yet
so
quick
himself
was
light
she
went
with
a
beautiful
rush
they
grew
warm
and
walked
hand
in
hand
a
flush
came
into
the
sky
the
wan
moon
down
the
west
sank
into
insignificance
on
the
shadowy
land
things
began
to
take
life
plants
with
great
leaves
became
distinct
they
came
through
a
pass
in
the
big
cold
sandhills
on
to
the
beach
the
long
waste
of
foreshore
lay
moaning
under
the
dawn
and
the
sea
the
ocean
was
a
flat
dark
strip
with
a
white
edge
over
the
gloomy
sea
the
sky
grew
red
quickly
the
fire
spread
among
the
clouds
and
scattered
them
crimson
burned
to
orange
orange
to
dull
gold
and
in
a
golden
glitter
the
sun
came
up
dribbling
fierily
over
the
waves
in
little
splashes
as
if
someone
had
gone
along
and
the
light
had
spilled
from
her
pail
as
she
walked
the
breakers
ran
down
the
shore
in
long
hoarse
strokes
tiny
seagulls
like
specks
of
spray
wheeled
above
the
line
of
surf
their
crying
seemed
larger
than
they
far
away
the
coast
reached
out
and
melted
into
the
morning
the
tussocky
sandhills
seemed
to
sink
to
a
level
with
the
beach
mablethorpe
was
tiny
on
their
right
they
had
alone
the
space
of
all
this
level
shore
the
sea
and
the
upcoming
sun
the
faint
noise
of
the
waters
the
sharp
crying
of
the
gulls
they
had
a
warm
hollow
in
the
sandhills
where
the
wind
did
not
come
he
stood
looking
out
to
sea
it
very
fine
he
said
now
do
get
sentimental
she
said
it
irritated
her
to
see
him
standing
gazing
at
the
sea
like
a
solitary
and
poetic
person
he
laughed
she
quickly
undressed
there
are
some
fine
waves
this
morning
she
said
triumphantly
she
was
a
better
swimmer
than
he
he
stood
idly
watching
her
are
you
coming
she
said
in
a
minute
he
answered
she
was
white
and
velvet
skinned
with
heavy
shoulders
a
little
wind
coming
from
the
sea
blew
across
her
body
and
ruffled
her
hair
the
morning
was
of
a
lovely
limpid
gold
colour
veils
of
shadow
seemed
to
be
drifting
away
on
the
north
and
the
south
clara
stood
shrinking
slightly
from
the
touch
of
the
wind
twisting
her
hair
the
rose
behind
the
white
stripped
woman
she
glanced
at
the
sea
then
looked
at
him
he
was
watching
her
with
dark
eyes
which
she
loved
and
could
not
understand
she
hugged
her
breasts
between
her
arms
cringing
laughing
oo
it
will
be
so
cold
she
said
he
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
held
her
suddenly
close
and
kissed
her
again
she
stood
waiting
he
looked
into
her
eyes
then
away
at
the
pale
sands
go
then
he
said
quietly
she
flung
her
arms
round
his
neck
drew
him
against
her
kissed
him
passionately
and
went
saying
but
you
come
in
in
a
she
went
plodding
heavily
over
the
sand
that
was
soft
as
velvet
he
on
the
sandhills
watched
the
great
pale
coast
envelop
her
she
grew
smaller
lost
proportion
seemed
only
like
a
large
white
bird
toiling
forward
not
much
more
than
a
big
white
pebble
on
the
beach
not
much
more
than
a
clot
of
foam
being
blown
and
rolled
over
the
sand
he
said
to
himself
she
seemed
to
move
very
slowly
across
the
vast
sounding
shore
as
he
watched
he
lost
her
she
was
dazzled
out
of
sight
by
the
sunshine
again
he
saw
her
the
merest
white
speck
moving
against
the
white
muttering
look
how
little
she
is
he
said
to
himself
she
lost
like
a
grain
of
sand
in
the
beach
just
a
concentrated
speck
blown
along
a
tiny
white
almost
nothing
among
the
morning
why
does
she
absorb
me
the
morning
was
altogether
uninterrupted
she
was
gone
in
the
water
far
and
wide
the
beach
the
sandhills
with
their
blue
marrain
the
shining
water
glowed
together
in
immense
unbroken
solitude
what
is
she
after
all
he
said
to
himself
here
the
seacoast
morning
big
and
permanent
and
beautiful
there
is
she
fretting
always
unsatisfied
and
temporary
as
a
bubble
of
foam
what
does
she
mean
to
me
after
all
she
represents
something
like
a
bubble
of
foam
represents
the
sea
but
what
is
she
it
not
her
i
care
then
startled
by
his
own
unconscious
thoughts
that
seemed
to
speak
so
distinctly
that
all
the
morning
could
hear
he
undressed
and
ran
quickly
down
the
sands
she
was
watching
for
him
her
arm
flashed
up
to
him
she
heaved
on
a
wave
subsided
her
shoulders
in
a
pool
of
liquid
silver
he
jumped
through
the
breakers
and
in
a
moment
her
hand
was
on
his
shoulder
he
was
a
poor
swimmer
and
could
not
stay
long
in
the
water
she
played
round
him
in
triumph
sporting
with
her
superiority
which
he
begrudged
her
the
sunshine
stood
deep
and
fine
on
the
water
they
laughed
in
the
sea
for
a
minute
or
two
then
raced
each
other
back
to
the
sandhills
when
they
were
drying
themselves
panting
heavily
he
watched
her
laughing
breathless
face
her
bright
shoulders
her
breasts
that
swayed
and
made
him
frightened
as
she
rubbed
them
and
he
thought
again
but
she
is
magnificent
and
even
bigger
than
the
morning
and
the
sea
is
she
is
she
she
seeing
his
dark
eyes
fixed
on
her
broke
off
from
her
drying
with
a
laugh
what
are
you
looking
at
she
said
you
he
answered
laughing
her
eyes
met
his
and
in
a
moment
he
was
kissing
her
white
shoulder
and
thinking
what
is
she
what
is
she
she
loved
him
in
the
morning
there
was
something
detached
hard
and
elemental
about
his
kisses
then
as
if
he
were
only
conscious
of
his
own
will
not
in
the
least
of
her
and
her
wanting
him
later
in
the
day
he
went
out
sketching
you
he
said
to
her
go
with
your
mother
to
sutton
i
am
so
she
stood
and
looked
at
him
he
knew
she
wanted
to
come
with
him
but
he
preferred
to
be
alone
she
made
him
feel
imprisoned
when
she
was
there
as
if
he
could
not
get
a
free
deep
breath
as
if
there
were
something
on
top
of
him
she
felt
his
desire
to
be
free
of
her
in
the
evening
he
came
back
to
her
they
walked
down
the
shore
in
the
darkness
then
sat
for
a
while
in
the
shelter
of
the
sandhills
it
seems
she
said
as
they
stared
over
the
darkness
of
the
sea
where
no
light
was
to
be
seen
it
seemed
as
if
you
only
loved
me
at
night
as
if
you
did
love
me
in
the
he
ran
the
cold
sand
through
his
fingers
feeling
guilty
under
the
accusation
the
night
is
free
to
you
he
replied
in
the
daytime
i
want
to
be
by
but
why
she
said
why
even
now
when
we
are
on
this
short
holiday
i
do
know
stifles
me
in
the
but
it
need
be
always
she
said
it
always
is
he
answered
when
you
and
i
are
she
sat
feeling
very
bitter
do
you
ever
want
to
marry
me
he
asked
curiously
do
you
me
she
replied
yes
yes
i
should
like
us
to
have
children
he
answered
slowly
she
sat
with
her
head
bent
fingering
the
sand
but
you
do
really
want
a
divorce
from
baxter
do
you
he
said
it
was
some
minutes
before
she
replied
no
she
said
very
deliberately
i
do
think
i
why
i
do
do
you
feel
as
if
you
belonged
to
him
no
i
do
think
what
then
i
think
he
belongs
to
me
she
replied
he
was
silent
for
some
minutes
listening
to
the
wind
blowing
over
the
hoarse
dark
sea
and
you
never
really
intended
to
belong
to
me
he
said
yes
i
do
belong
to
you
she
answered
no
he
said
because
you
do
want
to
be
it
was
a
knot
they
could
not
untie
so
they
left
it
took
what
they
could
get
and
what
they
could
not
attain
they
ignored
i
consider
you
treated
baxter
rottenly
he
said
another
time
he
clara
to
answer
him
as
his
mother
would
you
consider
your
own
affairs
and
do
know
so
much
about
other
but
she
took
him
seriously
almost
to
his
own
surprise
why
she
said
i
suppose
you
thought
he
was
a
lily
of
the
valley
and
so
you
put
him
in
an
appropriate
pot
and
tended
him
according
you
made
up
your
mind
he
was
a
lily
of
the
valley
and
it
was
no
good
his
being
a
you
would
have
i
certainly
never
imagined
him
a
lily
of
the
you
imagined
him
something
he
was
that
just
what
a
woman
is
she
thinks
she
knows
what
good
for
a
man
and
she
going
to
see
he
gets
it
and
no
matter
if
he
starving
he
may
sit
and
whistle
for
what
he
needs
while
she
got
him
and
is
giving
him
what
good
for
and
what
are
you
doing
she
asked
i
thinking
what
tune
i
shall
whistle
he
laughed
and
instead
of
boxing
his
ears
she
considered
him
in
earnest
you
think
i
want
to
give
you
what
good
for
you
she
asked
i
hope
so
but
love
should
give
a
sense
of
freedom
not
of
prison
miriam
made
me
feel
tied
up
like
a
donkey
to
a
stake
i
must
feed
on
her
patch
and
nowhere
else
it
sickening
and
would
you
let
a
woman
do
as
she
likes
yes
i
see
that
she
likes
to
love
me
if
she
does
well
i
hold
if
you
were
as
wonderful
as
you
say
replied
clara
i
should
be
the
marvel
i
am
he
laughed
there
was
a
silence
in
which
they
hated
each
other
though
they
laughed
love
a
dog
in
a
manger
he
said
and
which
of
us
is
the
dog
she
asked
oh
well
you
of
so
there
went
on
a
battle
between
them
she
knew
she
never
fully
had
him
some
part
big
and
vital
in
him
she
had
no
hold
over
nor
did
she
ever
try
to
get
it
or
even
to
realise
what
it
was
and
he
knew
in
some
way
that
she
held
herself
still
as
dawes
she
did
not
love
dawes
never
had
loved
him
but
she
believed
he
loved
her
at
least
depended
on
her
she
felt
a
certain
surety
about
him
that
she
never
felt
with
paul
morel
her
passion
for
the
young
man
had
filled
her
soul
given
her
a
certain
satisfaction
eased
her
of
her
her
doubt
whatever
else
she
was
she
was
inwardly
assured
it
was
almost
as
if
she
had
gained
herself
and
stood
now
distinct
and
complete
she
had
received
her
confirmation
but
she
never
believed
that
her
life
belonged
to
paul
morel
nor
his
to
her
they
would
separate
in
the
end
and
the
rest
of
her
life
would
be
an
ache
after
him
but
at
any
rate
she
knew
now
she
was
sure
of
herself
and
the
same
could
almost
be
said
of
him
together
they
had
received
the
baptism
of
life
each
through
the
other
but
now
their
missions
were
separate
where
he
wanted
to
go
she
could
not
come
with
him
they
would
have
to
part
sooner
or
later
even
if
they
married
and
were
faithful
to
each
other
still
he
would
have
to
leave
her
go
on
alone
and
she
would
only
have
to
attend
to
him
when
he
came
home
but
it
was
not
possible
each
wanted
a
mate
to
go
side
by
side
with
clara
had
gone
to
live
with
her
mother
upon
mapperley
plains
one
evening
as
paul
and
she
were
walking
along
woodborough
road
they
met
dawes
morel
knew
something
about
the
bearing
of
the
man
approaching
but
he
was
absorbed
in
his
thinking
at
the
moment
so
that
only
his
artist
eye
watched
the
form
of
the
stranger
then
he
suddenly
turned
to
clara
with
a
laugh
and
put
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
saying
laughing
but
we
walk
side
by
side
and
yet
i
in
london
arguing
with
an
imaginary
orpen
and
where
are
you
at
that
instant
dawes
passed
almost
touching
morel
the
young
man
glanced
saw
the
dark
brown
eyes
burning
full
of
hate
and
yet
tired
who
was
that
he
asked
of
clara
it
was
baxter
she
replied
paul
took
his
hand
from
her
shoulder
and
glanced
round
then
he
saw
again
distinctly
the
man
form
as
it
approached
him
dawes
still
walked
erect
with
his
fine
shoulders
flung
back
and
his
face
lifted
but
there
was
a
furtive
look
in
his
eyes
that
gave
one
the
impression
he
was
trying
to
get
unnoticed
past
every
person
he
met
glancing
suspiciously
to
see
what
they
thought
of
him
and
his
hands
seemed
to
be
wanting
to
hide
he
wore
old
clothes
the
trousers
were
torn
at
the
knee
and
the
handkerchief
tied
round
his
throat
was
dirty
but
his
cap
was
still
defiantly
over
one
eye
as
she
saw
him
clara
felt
guilty
there
was
a
tiredness
and
despair
on
his
face
that
made
her
hate
him
because
it
hurt
her
he
looks
shady
said
paul
but
the
note
of
pity
in
his
voice
reproached
her
and
made
her
feel
hard
his
true
commonness
comes
out
she
answered
do
you
hate
him
he
asked
you
talk
she
said
about
the
cruelty
of
women
i
wish
you
knew
the
cruelty
of
men
in
their
brute
force
they
simply
do
know
that
the
woman
do
i
he
said
no
she
answered
do
i
know
you
exist
about
me
you
know
nothing
she
said
bitterly
about
me
no
more
than
baxter
knew
he
asked
perhaps
not
as
he
felt
puzzled
and
helpless
and
angry
there
she
walked
unknown
to
him
though
they
had
been
through
such
experience
together
but
you
know
me
pretty
well
he
said
she
did
not
answer
did
you
know
baxter
as
well
as
you
know
me
he
asked
he
would
let
me
she
said
and
i
have
let
you
know
me
it
what
men
wo
let
you
do
they
wo
let
you
get
really
near
to
them
she
said
and
have
i
let
you
yes
she
answered
slowly
but
you
never
come
near
to
me
you
come
out
of
yourself
you
ca
baxter
could
do
that
better
than
he
walked
on
pondering
he
was
angry
with
her
for
preferring
baxter
to
him
you
begin
to
value
baxter
now
you
not
got
him
he
said
no
i
can
only
see
where
he
was
different
from
but
he
felt
she
had
a
grudge
against
him
one
evening
as
they
were
coming
home
over
the
fields
she
startled
him
by
asking
do
you
think
it
worth
it
the
the
sex
part
the
act
of
loving
itself
yes
is
it
worth
anything
to
you
but
how
can
you
separate
it
he
said
it
the
culmination
of
everything
all
our
intimacy
culminates
not
for
me
she
said
he
was
silent
a
flash
of
hate
for
her
came
up
after
all
she
was
dissatisfied
with
him
even
there
where
he
thought
they
fulfilled
each
other
but
he
believed
her
too
implicitly
i
feel
she
continued
slowly
as
if
i
had
got
you
as
if
all
of
you
were
there
and
as
if
it
were
me
you
were
taking
who
then
something
just
for
yourself
it
has
been
fine
so
that
i
dare
think
of
it
but
is
it
me
you
want
or
is
it
it
he
again
felt
guilty
did
he
leave
clara
out
of
count
and
take
simply
women
but
he
thought
that
was
splitting
a
hair
when
i
had
baxter
actually
had
him
then
i
did
feel
as
if
i
had
all
of
him
she
said
and
it
was
better
he
asked
yes
yes
it
was
more
whole
i
do
say
you
have
given
me
more
than
he
ever
gave
or
could
give
yes
perhaps
but
you
never
given
me
he
knitted
his
brows
angrily
if
i
start
to
make
love
to
you
he
said
i
just
go
like
a
leaf
down
the
and
leave
me
out
of
count
she
said
and
then
is
it
nothing
to
you
he
asked
almost
rigid
with
chagrin
it
something
and
sometimes
you
have
carried
me
away
right
away
i
know
and
i
reverence
you
for
it
but
do
me
he
said
kissing
her
quickly
as
a
fire
ran
through
him
she
submitted
and
was
silent
it
was
true
as
he
said
as
a
rule
when
he
started
the
emotion
was
strong
enough
to
carry
with
it
everything
reason
soul
blood
in
a
great
sweep
like
the
trent
carries
bodily
its
and
intertwinings
noiselessly
gradually
the
little
criticisms
the
little
sensations
were
lost
thought
also
went
everything
borne
along
in
one
flood
he
became
not
a
man
with
a
mind
but
a
great
instinct
his
hands
were
like
creatures
living
his
limbs
his
body
were
all
life
and
consciousness
subject
to
no
will
of
his
but
living
in
themselves
just
as
he
was
so
it
seemed
the
vigorous
wintry
stars
were
strong
also
with
life
he
and
they
struck
with
the
same
pulse
of
fire
and
the
same
joy
of
strength
which
held
the
stiff
near
his
eyes
held
his
own
body
firm
it
was
as
if
he
and
the
stars
and
the
dark
herbage
and
clara
were
licked
up
in
an
immense
tongue
of
flame
which
tore
onwards
and
upwards
everything
rushed
along
in
living
beside
him
everything
was
still
perfect
in
itself
along
with
him
this
wonderful
stillness
in
each
thing
in
itself
while
it
was
being
borne
along
in
a
very
ecstasy
of
living
seemed
the
highest
point
of
bliss
and
clara
knew
this
held
him
to
her
so
she
trusted
altogether
to
the
passion
it
however
failed
her
very
often
they
did
not
often
reach
again
the
height
of
that
once
when
the
peewits
had
called
gradually
some
mechanical
effort
spoilt
their
loving
or
when
they
had
splendid
moments
they
had
them
separately
and
not
so
satisfactorily
so
often
he
seemed
merely
to
be
running
on
alone
often
they
realised
it
had
been
a
failure
not
what
they
had
wanted
he
left
her
knowing
that
evening
had
only
made
a
little
split
between
them
their
loving
grew
more
mechanical
without
the
marvellous
glamour
gradually
they
began
to
introduce
novelties
to
get
back
some
of
the
feeling
of
satisfaction
they
would
be
very
near
almost
dangerously
near
to
the
river
so
that
the
black
water
ran
not
far
from
his
face
and
it
gave
a
little
thrill
or
they
loved
sometimes
in
a
little
hollow
below
the
fence
of
the
path
where
people
were
passing
occasionally
on
the
edge
of
the
town
and
they
heard
footsteps
coming
almost
felt
the
vibration
of
the
tread
and
they
heard
what
the
passersby
said
strange
little
things
that
were
never
intended
to
be
heard
and
afterwards
each
of
them
was
rather
ashamed
and
these
things
caused
a
distance
between
the
two
of
them
he
began
to
despise
her
a
little
as
if
she
had
merited
it
one
night
he
left
her
to
go
to
daybrook
station
over
the
fields
it
was
very
dark
with
an
attempt
at
snow
although
the
spring
was
so
far
advanced
morel
had
not
much
time
he
plunged
forward
the
town
ceases
almost
abruptly
on
the
edge
of
a
steep
hollow
there
the
houses
with
their
yellow
lights
stand
up
against
the
darkness
he
went
over
the
stile
and
dropped
quickly
into
the
hollow
of
the
fields
under
the
orchard
one
warm
window
shone
in
swineshead
farm
paul
glanced
round
behind
the
houses
stood
on
the
brim
of
the
dip
black
against
the
sky
like
wild
beasts
glaring
curiously
with
yellow
eyes
down
into
the
darkness
it
was
the
town
that
seemed
savage
and
uncouth
glaring
on
the
clouds
at
the
back
of
him
some
creature
stirred
under
the
willows
of
the
farm
pond
it
was
too
dark
to
distinguish
anything
he
was
close
up
to
the
next
stile
before
he
saw
a
dark
shape
leaning
against
it
the
man
moved
aside
he
said
morel
answered
not
noticing
paul
morel
said
the
man
then
he
knew
it
was
dawes
the
man
stopped
his
way
i
got
yer
have
i
he
said
awkwardly
i
shall
miss
my
train
said
paul
he
could
see
nothing
of
dawes
face
the
man
teeth
seemed
to
chatter
as
he
talked
you
going
to
get
it
from
me
now
said
dawes
morel
attempted
to
move
forward
the
other
man
stepped
in
front
of
him
are
yer
goin
to
take
that
off
he
said
or
are
you
goin
to
lie
down
to
it
paul
was
afraid
the
man
was
mad
but
he
said
i
do
know
how
to
all
right
then
answered
dawes
and
before
the
younger
man
knew
where
he
was
he
was
staggering
backwards
from
a
blow
across
the
face
the
whole
night
went
black
he
tore
off
his
overcoat
and
coat
dodging
a
blow
and
flung
the
garments
over
dawes
the
latter
swore
savagely
morel
in
his
was
now
alert
and
furious
he
felt
his
whole
body
unsheath
itself
like
a
claw
he
could
not
fight
so
he
would
use
his
wits
the
other
man
became
more
distinct
to
him
he
could
see
particularly
the
dawes
stumbled
over
paul
coats
then
came
rushing
forward
the
young
man
mouth
was
bleeding
it
was
the
other
man
mouth
he
was
dying
to
get
at
and
the
desire
was
anguish
in
its
strength
he
stepped
quickly
through
the
stile
and
as
dawes
was
coming
through
after
him
like
a
flash
he
got
a
blow
in
over
the
mouth
he
shivered
with
pleasure
dawes
advanced
slowly
spitting
paul
was
afraid
he
moved
round
to
get
to
the
stile
again
suddenly
from
out
of
nowhere
came
a
great
blow
against
his
ear
that
sent
him
falling
helpless
backwards
he
heard
dawes
heavy
panting
like
a
wild
beast
then
came
a
kick
on
the
knee
giving
him
such
agony
that
he
got
up
and
quite
blind
leapt
clean
under
his
enemy
guard
he
felt
blows
and
kicks
but
they
did
not
hurt
he
hung
on
to
the
bigger
man
like
a
wild
cat
till
at
last
dawes
fell
with
a
crash
losing
his
presence
of
mind
paul
went
down
with
him
pure
instinct
brought
his
hands
to
the
neck
and
before
dawes
in
frenzy
and
agony
could
wrench
him
free
he
had
got
his
fists
twisted
in
the
scarf
and
his
knuckles
dug
in
the
throat
of
the
other
man
he
was
a
pure
instinct
without
reason
or
feeling
his
body
hard
and
wonderful
in
itself
cleaved
against
the
struggling
body
of
the
other
man
not
a
muscle
in
him
relaxed
he
was
quite
unconscious
only
his
body
had
taken
upon
itself
to
kill
this
other
man
for
himself
he
had
neither
feeling
nor
reason
he
lay
pressed
hard
against
his
adversary
his
body
adjusting
itself
to
its
one
pure
purpose
of
choking
the
other
man
resisting
exactly
at
the
right
moment
with
exactly
the
right
amount
of
strength
the
struggles
of
the
other
silent
intent
unchanging
gradually
pressing
its
knuckles
deeper
feeling
the
struggles
of
the
other
body
become
wilder
and
more
frenzied
tighter
and
tighter
grew
his
body
like
a
screw
that
is
gradually
increasing
in
pressure
till
something
breaks
then
suddenly
he
relaxed
full
of
wonder
and
misgiving
dawes
had
been
yielding
morel
felt
his
body
flame
with
pain
as
he
realised
what
he
was
doing
he
was
all
bewildered
dawes
struggles
suddenly
renewed
themselves
in
a
furious
spasm
paul
hands
were
wrenched
torn
out
of
the
scarf
in
which
they
were
knotted
and
he
was
flung
away
helpless
he
heard
the
horrid
sound
of
the
other
gasping
but
he
lay
stunned
then
still
dazed
he
felt
the
blows
of
the
other
feet
and
lost
consciousness
dawes
grunting
with
pain
like
a
beast
was
kicking
the
prostrate
body
of
his
rival
suddenly
the
whistle
of
the
train
shrieked
two
fields
away
he
turned
round
and
glared
suspiciously
what
was
coming
he
saw
the
lights
of
the
train
draw
across
his
vision
it
seemed
to
him
people
were
approaching
he
made
off
across
the
field
into
nottingham
and
dimly
in
his
consciousness
as
he
went
he
felt
on
his
foot
the
place
where
his
boot
had
knocked
against
one
of
the
lad
bones
the
knock
seemed
to
inside
him
he
hurried
to
get
away
from
it
morel
gradually
came
to
himself
he
knew
where
he
was
and
what
had
happened
but
he
did
not
want
to
move
he
lay
still
with
tiny
bits
of
snow
tickling
his
face
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
quite
quite
still
the
time
passed
it
was
the
bits
of
snow
that
kept
rousing
him
when
he
did
not
want
to
be
roused
at
last
his
will
clicked
into
action
i
must
lie
here
he
said
it
but
still
he
did
not
move
i
said
i
was
going
to
get
up
he
repeated
why
do
i
and
still
it
was
some
time
before
he
had
sufficiently
pulled
himself
together
to
stir
then
gradually
he
got
up
pain
made
him
sick
and
dazed
but
his
brain
was
clear
reeling
he
groped
for
his
coats
and
got
them
on
buttoning
his
overcoat
up
to
his
ears
it
was
some
time
before
he
found
his
cap
he
did
not
know
whether
his
face
was
still
bleeding
walking
blindly
every
step
making
him
sick
with
pain
he
went
back
to
the
pond
and
washed
his
face
and
hands
the
icy
water
hurt
but
helped
to
bring
him
back
to
himself
he
crawled
back
up
the
hill
to
the
tram
he
wanted
to
get
to
his
mother
he
must
get
to
his
mother
that
was
his
blind
intention
he
covered
his
face
as
much
as
he
could
and
struggled
sickly
along
continually
the
ground
seemed
to
fall
away
from
him
as
he
walked
and
he
felt
himself
dropping
with
a
sickening
feeling
into
space
so
like
a
nightmare
he
got
through
with
the
journey
home
everybody
was
in
bed
he
looked
at
himself
his
face
was
discoloured
and
smeared
with
blood
almost
like
a
dead
man
face
he
washed
it
and
went
to
bed
the
night
went
by
in
delirium
in
the
morning
he
found
his
mother
looking
at
him
her
blue
eyes
they
were
all
he
wanted
to
see
she
was
there
he
was
in
her
hands
it
not
much
mother
he
said
it
was
baxter
tell
me
where
it
hurts
you
she
said
quietly
i
do
know
my
shoulder
say
it
was
a
bicycle
accident
he
could
not
move
his
arm
presently
minnie
the
little
servant
came
upstairs
with
some
tea
your
mother
nearly
frightened
me
out
of
my
wits
fainted
away
she
said
he
felt
he
could
not
bear
it
his
mother
nursed
him
he
told
her
about
it
and
now
i
should
have
done
with
them
all
she
said
quietly
i
will
she
covered
him
up
and
do
think
about
it
she
said
only
try
to
go
to
sleep
the
doctor
wo
be
here
till
he
had
a
dislocated
shoulder
and
the
second
day
acute
bronchitis
set
in
his
mother
was
pale
as
death
now
and
very
thin
she
would
sit
and
look
at
him
then
away
into
space
there
was
something
between
them
that
neither
dared
mention
clara
came
to
see
him
afterwards
he
said
to
his
mother
she
makes
me
tired
yes
i
wish
she
would
come
morel
replied
another
day
miriam
came
but
she
seemed
almost
like
a
stranger
to
him
you
know
i
do
care
about
them
mother
he
said
i
afraid
you
do
my
son
she
replied
sadly
it
was
given
out
everywhere
that
it
was
a
bicycle
accident
soon
he
was
able
to
go
to
work
again
but
now
there
was
a
constant
sickness
and
gnawing
at
his
heart
he
went
to
clara
but
there
seemed
as
it
were
nobody
there
he
could
not
work
he
and
his
mother
seemed
almost
to
avoid
each
other
there
was
some
secret
between
them
which
they
could
not
bear
he
was
not
aware
of
it
he
only
knew
that
his
life
seemed
unbalanced
as
if
it
were
going
to
smash
into
pieces
clara
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
she
realised
that
he
seemed
unaware
of
her
even
when
he
came
to
her
he
seemed
unaware
of
her
always
he
was
somewhere
else
she
felt
she
was
clutching
for
him
and
he
was
somewhere
else
it
tortured
her
and
so
she
tortured
him
for
a
month
at
a
time
she
kept
him
at
arm
length
he
almost
hated
her
and
was
driven
to
her
in
spite
of
himself
he
went
mostly
into
the
company
of
men
was
always
at
the
george
or
the
white
horse
his
mother
was
ill
distant
quiet
shadowy
he
was
terrified
of
something
he
dared
not
look
at
her
her
eyes
seemed
to
grow
darker
her
face
more
waxen
still
she
dragged
about
at
her
work
at
whitsuntide
he
said
he
would
go
to
blackpool
for
four
days
with
his
friend
newton
the
latter
was
a
big
jolly
fellow
with
a
touch
of
the
bounder
about
him
paul
said
his
mother
must
go
to
sheffield
to
stay
a
week
with
annie
who
lived
there
perhaps
the
change
would
do
her
good
morel
was
attending
a
woman
doctor
in
nottingham
he
said
her
heart
and
her
digestion
were
wrong
she
consented
to
go
to
sheffield
though
she
did
not
want
to
but
now
she
would
do
everything
her
son
wished
of
her
paul
said
he
would
come
for
her
on
the
fifth
day
and
stay
also
in
sheffield
till
the
holiday
was
up
it
was
agreed
the
two
young
men
set
off
gaily
for
blackpool
morel
was
quite
lively
as
paul
kissed
her
and
left
her
once
at
the
station
he
forgot
everything
four
days
were
clear
not
an
anxiety
not
a
thought
the
two
young
men
simply
enjoyed
themselves
paul
was
like
another
man
none
of
himself
remained
no
clara
no
miriam
no
mother
that
fretted
him
he
wrote
to
them
all
and
long
letters
to
his
mother
but
they
were
jolly
letters
that
made
her
laugh
he
was
having
a
good
time
as
young
fellows
will
in
a
place
like
blackpool
and
underneath
it
all
was
a
shadow
for
her
paul
was
very
gay
excited
at
the
thought
of
staying
with
his
mother
in
sheffield
newton
was
to
spend
the
day
with
them
their
train
was
late
joking
laughing
with
their
pipes
between
their
teeth
the
young
men
swung
their
bags
on
to
the
paul
had
bought
his
mother
a
little
collar
of
real
lace
that
he
wanted
to
see
her
wear
so
that
he
could
tease
her
about
it
annie
lived
in
a
nice
house
and
had
a
little
maid
paul
ran
gaily
up
the
steps
he
expected
his
mother
laughing
in
the
hall
but
it
was
annie
who
opened
to
him
she
seemed
distant
to
him
he
stood
a
second
in
dismay
annie
let
him
kiss
her
cheek
is
my
mother
ill
he
said
yes
she
not
very
well
do
upset
is
she
in
bed
and
then
the
queer
feeling
went
over
him
as
if
all
the
sunshine
had
gone
out
of
him
and
it
was
all
shadow
he
dropped
the
bag
and
ran
upstairs
hesitating
he
opened
the
door
his
mother
sat
up
in
bed
wearing
a
of
colour
she
looked
at
him
almost
as
if
she
were
ashamed
of
herself
pleading
to
him
humble
he
saw
the
ashy
look
about
her
mother
he
said
i
thought
you
were
never
coming
she
answered
gaily
but
he
only
fell
on
his
knees
at
the
bedside
and
buried
his
face
in
the
bedclothes
crying
in
agony
and
saying
mother
mother
mother
she
stroked
his
hair
slowly
with
her
thin
hand
do
cry
she
said
do
cry
it
but
he
felt
as
if
his
blood
was
melting
into
tears
and
he
cried
in
terror
and
pain
do
do
cry
his
mother
faltered
slowly
she
stroked
his
hair
shocked
out
of
himself
he
cried
and
the
tears
hurt
in
every
fibre
of
his
body
suddenly
he
stopped
but
he
dared
not
lift
his
face
out
of
the
bedclothes
you
are
late
where
have
you
been
his
mother
asked
the
train
was
late
he
replied
muffled
in
the
sheet
yes
that
miserable
central
is
newton
come
i
sure
you
must
be
hungry
and
they
kept
dinner
with
a
wrench
he
looked
up
at
her
what
is
it
mother
he
asked
brutally
she
averted
her
eyes
as
she
answered
only
a
bit
of
a
tumour
my
boy
you
need
trouble
it
been
there
the
lump
has
a
long
up
came
the
tears
again
his
mind
was
clear
and
hard
but
his
body
was
crying
where
he
said
she
put
her
hand
on
her
side
here
but
you
know
they
can
sweal
a
tumour
he
stood
feeling
dazed
and
helpless
like
a
child
he
thought
perhaps
it
was
as
she
said
yes
he
reassured
himself
it
was
so
but
all
the
while
his
blood
and
his
body
knew
definitely
what
it
was
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
took
her
hand
she
had
never
had
but
the
one
ring
her
when
were
you
poorly
he
asked
it
was
yesterday
it
began
she
answered
submissively
pains
yes
but
not
more
than
i
often
had
at
home
i
believe
ansell
is
an
you
ought
not
to
have
travelled
alone
he
said
to
himself
more
than
to
her
as
if
that
had
anything
to
do
with
it
she
answered
quickly
they
were
silent
for
a
while
now
go
and
have
your
dinner
she
said
you
must
be
have
you
had
yours
yes
a
beautiful
sole
i
had
annie
is
good
to
they
talked
a
little
while
then
he
went
downstairs
he
was
very
white
and
strained
newton
sat
in
miserable
sympathy
after
dinner
he
went
into
the
scullery
to
help
annie
to
wash
up
the
little
maid
had
gone
on
an
errand
is
it
really
a
tumour
he
asked
annie
began
to
cry
again
the
pain
she
had
yesterday
i
never
saw
anybody
suffer
like
it
she
cried
leonard
ran
like
a
madman
for
ansell
and
when
she
got
to
bed
she
said
to
me
look
at
this
lump
on
my
side
i
wonder
what
it
is
and
there
i
looked
and
i
thought
i
should
have
dropped
paul
as
true
as
i
here
it
a
lump
as
big
as
my
double
fist
i
said
gracious
mother
whenever
did
that
come
child
she
said
been
there
a
long
time
i
thought
i
should
have
died
our
paul
i
did
she
been
having
these
pains
for
months
at
home
and
nobody
looking
after
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
then
dried
suddenly
but
she
been
attending
the
doctor
in
nottingham
and
she
never
told
me
he
said
if
i
have
been
at
home
said
annie
i
should
have
seen
for
he
felt
like
a
man
walking
in
unrealities
in
the
afternoon
he
went
to
see
the
doctor
the
latter
was
a
shrewd
lovable
man
but
what
is
it
he
said
the
doctor
looked
at
the
young
man
then
knitted
his
fingers
it
may
be
a
large
tumour
which
has
formed
in
the
membrane
he
said
slowly
and
which
we
may
be
able
to
make
go
ca
you
operate
asked
paul
not
there
replied
the
doctor
are
you
sure
quite
paul
meditated
a
while
are
you
sure
it
a
tumour
he
asked
why
did
jameson
in
nottingham
never
find
out
anything
about
it
she
been
going
to
him
for
weeks
and
he
treated
her
for
heart
and
mrs
morel
never
told
jameson
about
the
lump
said
the
doctor
and
do
you
know
it
a
tumour
no
i
am
not
what
else
might
it
be
you
asked
my
sister
if
there
was
cancer
in
the
family
might
it
be
cancer
i
do
and
what
shall
you
do
i
should
like
an
examination
with
then
have
you
must
arrange
about
that
his
fee
would
be
less
than
ten
guineas
to
come
here
from
when
would
you
like
him
to
come
i
will
call
in
this
evening
and
we
will
talk
it
paul
went
away
biting
his
lip
his
mother
could
come
downstairs
for
tea
the
doctor
said
her
son
went
upstairs
to
help
her
she
wore
the
that
leonard
had
given
annie
and
with
a
little
colour
in
her
face
was
quite
young
again
but
you
look
quite
pretty
in
that
he
said
yes
they
make
me
so
fine
i
hardly
know
myself
she
answered
but
when
she
stood
up
to
walk
the
colour
went
paul
helped
her
her
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
she
was
gone
he
lifted
her
up
and
carried
her
quickly
downstairs
laid
her
on
the
couch
she
was
light
and
frail
her
face
looked
as
if
she
were
dead
with
blue
lips
shut
tight
her
eyes
opened
her
blue
unfailing
eyes
and
she
looked
at
him
pleadingly
almost
wanting
him
to
forgive
her
he
held
brandy
to
her
lips
but
her
mouth
would
not
open
all
the
time
she
watched
him
lovingly
she
was
only
sorry
for
him
the
tears
ran
down
his
face
without
ceasing
but
not
a
muscle
moved
he
was
intent
on
getting
a
little
brandy
between
her
lips
soon
she
was
able
to
swallow
a
teaspoonful
she
lay
back
so
tired
the
tears
continued
to
run
down
his
face
but
she
panted
it
go
off
do
cry
i
not
doing
he
said
after
a
while
she
was
better
again
he
was
kneeling
beside
the
couch
they
looked
into
each
other
eyes
i
do
want
you
to
make
a
trouble
of
it
she
said
no
mother
you
have
to
be
quite
still
and
then
you
get
better
but
he
was
white
to
the
lips
and
their
eyes
as
they
looked
at
each
other
understood
her
eyes
were
so
blue
such
a
wonderful
blue
he
felt
if
only
they
had
been
of
a
different
colour
he
could
have
borne
it
better
his
heart
seemed
to
be
ripping
slowly
in
his
breast
he
kneeled
there
holding
her
hand
and
neither
said
anything
then
annie
came
in
are
you
all
right
she
murmured
timidly
to
her
mother
of
course
said
morel
paul
sat
down
and
told
her
about
blackpool
she
was
curious
a
day
or
two
after
he
went
to
see
jameson
in
nottingham
to
arrange
for
a
consultation
paul
had
practically
no
money
in
the
world
but
he
could
borrow
his
mother
had
been
used
to
go
to
the
public
consultation
on
saturday
morning
when
she
could
see
the
doctor
for
only
a
nominal
sum
her
son
went
on
the
same
day
the
was
full
of
poor
women
who
sat
patiently
on
a
bench
around
the
wall
paul
thought
of
his
mother
in
her
little
black
costume
sitting
waiting
likewise
the
doctor
was
late
the
women
all
looked
rather
frightened
paul
asked
the
nurse
in
attendance
if
he
could
see
the
doctor
immediately
he
came
it
was
arranged
so
the
women
sitting
patiently
round
the
walls
of
the
room
eyed
the
young
man
curiously
at
last
the
doctor
came
he
was
about
forty
his
wife
had
died
and
he
who
had
loved
her
had
specialised
on
women
ailments
paul
told
his
name
and
his
mother
the
doctor
did
not
remember
number
said
the
nurse
and
the
doctor
looked
up
the
case
in
his

asking

he
could
scarcely
do
more
than

his
own
name
the
doctor
came
leonard
felt
it
his
duty
to
meet
him
with
a
cab
the
examination
did
not
take
long
annie
arthur
paul
and
leonard
were
waiting
in
the
parlour
anxiously
the
doctors
came
down
paul
glanced
at
them
he
had
never
had
any
hope
except
when
he
had
deceived
himself
it
may
be
a
tumour
we
must
wait
and
see
said
jameson
and
if

said
the
doctor
paul
put
eight
sovereigns
and
half
a
sovereign
on
the
table
the
doctor
counted
them
took
a
florin
out
of
his
purse
and
put
that
down
thank
you
he
said
i
sorry
morel

so
ill
but
we
must
see
what
we
can
there
ca
be
an
operation
said
paul
the
doctor
shook
his
head
no
he
said
and
even
if
there
could
her
heart
would
stand
is
her
heart
risky
asked
paul
yes
you
must
be
careful
with
very
risky
no
er
no
no
just
take
and
the
doctor
was
gone
then
paul
carried
his
mother
downstairs
she
lay
simply
like
a
child
but
when
he
was
on
the
stairs
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
clinging
i
so
frightened
of
these
beastly
stairs
she
said
and
he
was
frightened
too
he
would
let
leonard
do
it
another
time
he
felt
he
could
not
carry
her
he
thinks
it
only
a
tumour
cried
annie
to
her
mother
and
he
can
sweal
it
i
knew
he
could
protested
morel
scornfully
she
pretended
not
to
notice
that
paul
had
gone
out
of
the
room
he
sat
in
the
kitchen
smoking
then
he
tried
to
brush
some
grey
ash
off
his
coat
he
looked
again
it
was
one
of
his
mother
grey
hairs
it
was
so
long
he
held
it
up
and
it
drifted
into
the
chimney
he
let
go
the
long
grey
hair
floated
and
was
gone
in
the
blackness
of
the
chimney
the
next
day
he
kissed
her
before
going
back
to
work
it
was
very
early
in
the
morning
and
they
were
alone
you
wo
fret
my
boy
she
said
no
no
it
would
be
silly
and
take
care
of
yes
he
answered
then
after
a
while
and
i
shall
come
next
saturday
and
shall
bring
my
father
i
suppose
he
wants
to
come
she
replied
at
any
rate
if
he
does
you
have
to
let
he
kissed
her
again
and
stroked
the
hair
from
her
temples
gently
tenderly
as
if
she
were
a
lover
sha
you
be
late
she
murmured
i
going
he
said
very
low
still
he
sat
a
few
minutes
stroking
the
brown
and
grey
hair
from
her
temples
and
you
wo
be
any
worse
mother
no
my
you
promise
me
yes
i
wo
be
any
he
kissed
her
held
her
in
his
arms
for
a
moment
and
was
gone
in
the
early
sunny
morning
he
ran
to
the
station
crying
all
the
way
he
did
not
know
what
for
and
her
blue
eyes
were
wide
and
staring
as
she
thought
of
him
in
the
afternoon
he
went
a
walk
with
clara
they
sat
in
the
little
wood
where
bluebells
were
standing
he
took
her
hand
you
see
he
said
to
clara
she
never
be
oh
you
do
know
replied
the
other
i
do
he
said
she
caught
him
impulsively
to
her
breast
try
and
forget
it
dear
she
said
try
and
forget
i
will
he
answered
her
breast
was
there
warm
for
him
her
hands
were
in
his
hair
it
was
comforting
and
he
held
his
arms
round
her
but
he
did
not
forget
he
only
talked
to
clara
of
something
else
and
it
was
always
so
when
she
felt
it
coming
the
agony
she
cried
to
him
do
think
of
it
paul
do
think
of
it
my
darling
and
she
pressed
him
to
her
breast
rocked
him
soothed
him
like
a
child
so
he
put
the
trouble
aside
for
her
sake
to
take
it
up
again
immediately
he
was
alone
all
the
time
as
he
went
about
he
cried
mechanically
his
mind
and
hands
were
busy
he
cried
he
did
not
know
why
it
was
his
blood
weeping
he
was
just
as
much
alone
whether
he
was
with
clara
or
with
the
men
in
the
white
horse
just
himself
and
this
pressure
inside
him
that
was
all
that
existed
he
read
sometimes
he
had
to
keep
his
mind
occupied
and
clara
was
a
way
of
occupying
his
mind
on
the
saturday
walter
morel
went
to
sheffield
he
was
a
forlorn
figure
looking
rather
as
if
nobody
owned
him
paul
ran
upstairs
my
father
come
he
said
kissing
his
mother
has
he
she
answered
wearily
the
old
collier
came
rather
frightened
into
the
bedroom
how
dun
i
find
thee
lass
he
said
going
forward
and
kissing
her
in
a
hasty
timid
fashion
well
i
middlin
she
replied
i
see
tha
art
he
said
he
stood
looking
down
on
her
then
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
handkerchief
helpless
and
as
if
nobody
owned
him
he
looked
have
you
gone
on
all
right
asked
the
wife
rather
wearily
as
if
it
were
an
effort
to
talk
to
him
yis
he
answered
a
bit
now
and
again
as
yer
might
does
she
have
your
dinner
ready
asked
morel
well
i
to
shout
at
once
or
twice
he
said
and
you
must
shout
at
her
if
she
not
ready
she
will
leave
things
to
the
last
she
gave
him
a
few
instructions
he
sat
looking
at
her
as
if
she
were
almost
a
stranger
to
him
before
whom
he
was
awkward
and
humble
and
also
as
if
he
had
lost
his
presence
of
mind
and
wanted
to
run
this
feeling
that
he
wanted
to
run
away
that
he
was
on
thorns
to
be
gone
from
so
trying
a
situation
and
yet
must
linger
because
it
looked
better
made
his
presence
so
trying
he
put
up
his
eyebrows
for
misery
and
clenched
his
fists
on
his
knees
feeling
so
awkward
in
presence
of
big
trouble
morel
did
not
change
much
she
stayed
in
sheffield
for
two
months
if
anything
at
the
end
she
was
rather
worse
but
she
wanted
to
go
home
annie
had
her
children
morel
wanted
to
go
home
so
they
got
a
from
nottingham
for
she
was
too
ill
to
go
by
train
and
she
was
driven
through
the
sunshine
it
was
just
august
everything
was
bright
and
warm
under
the
blue
sky
they
could
all
see
she
was
dying
yet
she
was
jollier
than
she
had
been
for
weeks
they
all
laughed
and
talked
annie
she
exclaimed
i
saw
a
lizard
dart
on
that
rock
her
eyes
were
so
quick
she
was
still
so
full
of
life
morel
knew
she
was
coming
he
had
the
front
door
open
everybody
was
on
tiptoe
half
the
street
turned
out
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
great
morel
smiling
drove
home
down
the
street
and
just
look
at
them
all
come
out
to
see

she
said
but
there

suppose

should
have
done
the
same
how

mathews

you
harrison
they
none
of
them
could
hear
but
they
saw
her
smile
and
nod
and
they
all
saw
death
on
her
face
they
said
it
was
a
great
event
in
the
street
morel
wanted
to
carry
her
indoors
but
he
was
too
old
arthur
took
her
as
if
she
were
a
child
they
had
set
her
a
big
deep
chair
by
the
hearth
where
her
used
to
stand
when
she
was
unwrapped
and
seated
and
had
drunk
a
little
brandy
she
looked
round
the
room
do
think
i
do
like
your
house
annie
she
said
but
it
nice
to
be
in
my
own
home
and
morel
answered
huskily
it
is
lass

and
minnie
the
little
quaint
maid
said
an
we
glad
t

a
lovely
yellow
ravel
of

baxter
dawes
paul
exclaimed

morel
then

paul

the
doctor

and

in
day
out
ca

a
word
of
information

think
i
might
go
asked
paul
you
there
was
a
feeling
of
connection
between
the
rival
men
more
than
ever
since
they
had
fought
in
a
way
morel
felt
guilty
towards
the
other
and
more
or
less
responsible
and
being
in
such
a
state
of
soul
himself
he
felt
an
almost
painful
nearness
to
dawes
who
was
suffering
and
despairing
too
besides
they
had
met
in
a
naked
extremity
of
hate
and
it
was
a
bond
at
any
rate
the
elemental
man
in
each
had
met
he
went
down
to
the
isolation
hospital
with
ansell
card
this
sister
a
healthy
young
irishwoman
led
him
down
the
ward
a
visitor
to
see

jim
crow
she
said
dawes
turned
over
suddenly
with
a
startled
grunt
eh
caw
she
mocked
he
can
only
say
i
have
brought
you
a
gentleman
to
see
you
now
say
you
and
show
some
dawes
looked
swiftly
with
his
dark
startled
eyes
beyond
the
sister
at
paul
his
look
was
full
of
fear
mistrust
hate
and
misery
morel
met
the
swift
dark
eyes
and
hesitated
the
two
men
were
afraid
of
the
naked
selves
they
had
been
dr
ansell
told
me
you
were
here
said
morel
holding
out
his
hand
dawes
mechanically
shook
hands
so
i
thought
i
come
in
continued
paul
there
was
no
answer
dawes
lay
staring
at
the
opposite
wall
say
mocked
the
nurse
say
jim
he
is
getting
on
all
right
said
paul
to
her
oh
yes
he
lies
and
imagines
he
going
to
die
said
the
nurse
and
it
frightens
every
word
out
of
his
and
you
must
have
somebody
to
talk
to
laughed
morel
that
it
laughed
the
nurse
only
two
old
men
and
a
boy
who
always
cries
it

hard

said
the
nurse
i
suppose
i
am
a
godsend
he
laughed
oh
dropped
straight
from
heaven
laughed
the
nurse
presently
she
left
the
two
men
alone
dawes
was
thinner
and
handsome
again
but
life
seemed
low
in
him
as
the
doctor
said
he
was
lying
sulking
and
would
not
move
forward
towards
convalescence
he
seemed
to
grudge
every
beat
of
his
heart
have
you
had
a
bad
time
asked
paul
suddenly
again
dawes
looked
at
him
what
are
you
doing
in
sheffield
he
asked
my
mother

taken
ill
at
my
sister
in

here
there
was
no
answer
how
long
have
you
been
in
morel
asked
i
could
say
for
sure
dawes
answered
grudgingly
he
lay
staring
across
at
the
wall
opposite
as
if
trying
to
believe
morel
was
not
there
paul
felt
his
heart
go
hard
and
angry
dr
ansell
told
me
you
were
here
he
said
coldly
the
other
man
did
not
answer
typhoid
pretty
bad
i
know
morel
persisted
suddenly
dawes
said
what
did
you
come
for
because
ansell
said
you
did
know
anybody
here
do
you
i
know
nobody
nowhere
said
dawes

paul
it
because

another
silence

said
dawes
the
sick
man
was
gaunt
and
handsome
again
paul
was
sorry
for
him
because
his
eyes
looked
so
tired
did
you
get
a
job

he
asked

day
or
two
before

again

not

world

seaside

all
right
just
now
morel
said
sun
on
those
sandhills
and
the
waves
not
far
the
other
did
not
answer
by
gad
paul
concluded
too
miserable
to
bother
much
it
all
right
when
you
know
you
going
to
walk
again
and
swim
dawes
glanced
at
him
quickly
the
man
dark
eyes
were
afraid
to
meet
any
other
eyes
in
the
world
but
the
real
misery
and
helplessness
in
paul
tone
gave
him
a
feeling
of
relief
is
she
far
gone
he
asked
she
going
like
wax
paul
answered
but
cheerful
lively
he
bit
his
lip
after
a
minute
he
rose
well
i
be
going
he
said
i
leave
you
this
i
do
want
it
dawes
muttered
morel
did
not
answer
but
left
the
coin
on
the
table
well
he
said
i
try
and
run
in
when
i
back
in
sheffield
happen
you
might
like
to
see
my
he
works
in
i
do
know
him
said
dawes
he
all
right
should
i
tell
him
to
come
he
might
bring
you
some
papers
to
look
the
other
man
did
not
answer
paul
went
the
strong
emotion
that
dawes
aroused
in
him
repressed
made
him
shiver
he
did
not
tell
his
mother
but
next
day
he
spoke
to
clara
about
this
interview
it
was
in
the
the
two
did
not
often
go
out
together
now
but
this
day
he
asked
her
to
go
with
him
to
the
castle
grounds
there
they
sat
while
the
scarlet
geraniums
and
the
yellow
calceolarias
blazed
in
the
sunlight
she
was
now
always
rather
protective
and
rather
resentful
towards
him
did
you
know
baxter
was
in
sheffield
hospital
with
typhoid
he
asked
she
looked
at
him
with
startled
grey
eyes
and
her
face
went
pale
no
she
said
frightened
he
getting
better
i
went
to
see
him
yesterday
the
doctor
told
clara
seemed
stricken
by
the
news
is
he
very
bad
she
asked
guiltily
he
has
been
he
mending
what
did
he
say
to
you
oh
nothing
he
seems
to
be
there
was
a
distance
between
the
two
of
them
he
gave
her
more
information
she
went
about
shut
up
and
silent
the
next
time
they
took
a
walk
together
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
arm
and
walked
at
a
distance
from
him
he
was
wanting
her
comfort
badly
wo
you
be
nice
with
me
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
what
the
matter
he
said
putting
his
arm
across
her
shoulder
do
she
said
disengaging
herself
he
left
her
alone
and
returned
to
his
own
brooding
is
it
baxter
that
upsets
you
he
asked
at
length
i
have
been
vile
to
him
she
said
i
said
many
a
time
you
have
treated
him
well
he
replied
and
there
was
a
hostility
between
them
each
pursued
his
own
train
of
thought
i
treated
him
no
i
treated
him
badly
she
said
and
now
you
treat
me
badly
it
serves
me
how
do
i
treat
you
badly
he
said
it
serves
me
right
she
repeated
i
never
considered
him
worth
having
and
now
you
do
consider
me
but
it
serves
me
right
he
loved
me
a
thousand
times
better
than
you
ever
he
did
protested
paul
he
did
at
any
rate
he
did
respect
me
and
that
what
you
do
it
looked
as
if
he
respected
you
he
said
he
did
and
i
made
him
horrid
i
know
i
did
you
taught
me
that
and
he
loved
me
a
thousand
times
better
than
ever
you
all
right
said
paul
he
only
wanted
to
be
left
alone
now
he
had
his
own
trouble
which
was
almost
too
much
to
bear
clara
only
tormented
him
and
made
him
tired
he
was
not
sorry
when
he
left
her
she
went
on
the
first
opportunity
to
sheffield
to
see
her
husband
the
meeting
was
not
a
success
but
she
left
him
roses
and
fruit
and
money
she
wanted
to
make
restitution
it
was
not
that
she
loved
him
as
she
looked
at
him
lying
there
her
heart
did
not
warm
with
love
only
she
wanted
to
humble
herself
to
him
to
kneel
before
him
she
wanted
now
to
be
after
all
she
had
failed
to
make
morel
really
love
her
she
was
morally
frightened
she
wanted
to
do
penance
so
she
kneeled
to
dawes
and
it
gave
him
a
subtle
pleasure
but
the
distance
between
them
was
still
very
great
too
great
it
frightened
the
man
it
almost
pleased
the
woman
she
liked
to
feel
she
was
serving
him
across
an
insuperable
distance
she
was
proud
now
morel
went
to
see
dawes
once
or
twice
there
was
a
sort
of
friendship
between
the
two
men
who
were
all
the
while
deadly
rivals
but
they
never
mentioned
the
woman
who
was
between
them
morel
got
gradually
worse
at
first
they
used
to
carry
her
downstairs
sometimes
even
into
the
garden
she
sat
propped
in
her
chair
smiling
and
so
pretty
the
gold
shone
on
her
white
hand
her
hair
was
carefully
brushed
and
she
watched
the
tangled
sunflowers
dying
the
chrysanthemums
coming
out
and
the
dahlias
paul
and
she
were
afraid
of
each
other
he
knew
and
she
knew
that
she
was
dying
but
they
kept
up
a
pretence
of
cheerfulness
every
morning
when
he
got
up
he
went
into
her
room
in
his
pyjamas
did
you
sleep
my
dear
he
asked
yes
she
answered
not
very
well
well
yes
then
he
knew
she
had
lain
awake
he
saw
her
hand
under
the
bedclothes
pressing
the
place
on
her
side
where
the
pain
was
has
it
been
bad
he
asked
no
it
hurt
a
bit
but
nothing
to
and
she
sniffed
in
her
old
scornful
way
as
she
lay
she
looked
like
a
girl
and
all
the
while
her
blue
eyes
watched
him
but
there
were
the
dark
beneath
that
made
him
ache
again
it
a
sunny
day
he
said
it
a
beautiful
do
you
think
you
be
carried
down
i
shall
then
he
went
away
to
get
her
breakfast
all
day
long
he
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
her
it
was
a
long
ache
that
made
him
feverish
then
when
he
got
home
in
the
early
evening
he
glanced
through
the
kitchen
window
she
was
not
there
she
had
not
got
up
he
ran
straight
upstairs
and
kissed
her
he
was
almost
afraid
to
ask
did
you
get
up
pigeon
no
she
said
it
was
that
morphia
it
made
me
i
think
he
gives
you
too
much
he
said
i
think
he
does
she
answered
he
sat
down
by
the
bed
miserably
she
had
a
way
of
curling
and
lying
on
her
side
like
a
child
the
grey
and
brown
hair
was
loose
over
her
ear
does
it
tickle
you
he
said
gently
putting
it
back
it
does
she
replied
his
face
was
near
hers
her
blue
eyes
smiled
straight
into
his
like
a
girl
warm
laughing
with
tender
love
it
made
him
pant
with
terror
agony
and
love
you
want
your
hair
doing
in
a
plait
he
said
lie
and
going
behind
her
he
carefully
loosened
her
hair
brushed
it
out
it
was
like
fine
long
silk
of
brown
and
grey
her
head
was
snuggled
between
her
shoulders
as
he
lightly
brushed
and
plaited
her
hair
he
bit
his
lip
and
felt
dazed
it
all
seemed
unreal
he
could
not
understand
it
at
night
he
often
worked
in
her
room
looking
up
from
time
to
time
and
so
often
he
found
her
blue
eyes
fixed
on
him
and
when
their
eyes
met
she
smiled
he
worked
away
again
mechanically
producing
good
stuff
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
sometimes
he
came
in
very
pale
and
still
with
watchful
sudden
eyes
like
a
man
who
is
drunk
almost
to
death
they
were
both
afraid
of
the
veils
that
were
ripping
between
them
then
she
pretended
to
be
better
chattered
to
him
gaily
made
a
great
fuss
over
some
scraps
of
news
for
they
had
both
come
to
the
condition
when
they
had
to
make
much
of
the
trifles
lest
they
should
give
in
to
the
big
thing
and
their
human
independence
would
go
smash
they
were
afraid
so
they
made
light
of
things
and
were
gay
sometimes
as
she
lay
he
knew
she
was
thinking
of
the
past
her
mouth
gradually
shut
hard
in
a
line
she
was
holding
herself
rigid
so
that
she
might
die
without
ever
uttering
the
great
cry
that
was
tearing
from
her
he
never
forgot
that
hard
utterly
lonely
and
stubborn
clenching
of
her
mouth
which
persisted
for
weeks
sometimes
when
it
was
lighter
she
talked
about
her
husband
now
she
hated
him
she
did
not
forgive
him
she
could
not
bear
him
to
be
in
the
room
and
a
few
things
the
things
that
had
been
most
bitter
to
her
came
up
again
so
strongly
that
they
broke
from
her
and
she
told
her
son
he
felt
as
if
his
life
were
being
destroyed
piece
by
piece
within
him
often
the
tears
came
suddenly
he
ran
to
the
station
the
falling
on
the
pavement
often
he
could
not
go
on
with
his
work
the
pen
stopped
writing
he
sat
staring
quite
unconscious
and
when
he
came
round
again
he
felt
sick
and
trembled
in
his
limbs
he
never
questioned
what
it
was
his
mind
did
not
try
to
analyse
or
understand
he
merely
submitted
and
kept
his
eyes
shut
let
the
thing
go
over
him
his
mother
did
the
same
she
thought
of
the
pain
of
the
morphia
of
the
next
day
hardly
ever
of
the
death
that
was
coming
she
knew
she
had
to
submit
to
it
but
she
would
never
entreat
it
or
make
friends
with
it
blind
with
her
face
shut
hard
and
blind
she
was
pushed
towards
the
door
the
days
passed
the
weeks
the
months
sometimes
in
the
sunny
afternoons
she
seemed
almost
happy
i
try
to
think
of
the
nice
times
when
we
went
to
mablethorpe
and
robin
hood
bay
and
shanklin
she
said
after
all
not
everybody
has
seen
those
beautiful
places
and
was
it
beautiful
i
try
to
think
of
that
not
of
the
other
then
again
for
a
whole
evening
she
spoke
not
a
word
neither
did
he
they
were
together
rigid
stubborn
silent
he
went
into
his
room
at
last
to
go
to
bed
and
leaned
against
the
doorway
as
if
paralysed
unable
to
go
any
farther
his
consciousness
went
a
furious
storm
he
knew
not
what
seemed
to
ravage
inside
him
he
stood
leaning
there
submitting
never
questioning
in
the
morning
they
were
both
normal
again
though
her
face
was
grey
with
the
morphia
and
her
body
felt
like
ash
but
they
were
bright
again
nevertheless
often
especially
if
annie
or
arthur
were
at
home
he
neglected
her
he
did
not
see
much
of
clara
usually
he
was
with
men
he
was
quick
and
active
and
lively
but
when
his
friends
saw
him
go
white
to
the
gills
his
eyes
dark
and
glittering
they
had
a
certain
mistrust
of
him
sometimes
he
went
to
clara
but
she
was
almost
cold
to
him
take
me
he
said
simply
occasionally
she
would
but
she
was
afraid
when
he
had
her
then
there
was
something
in
it
that
made
her
shrink
away
from
him
something
unnatural
she
grew
to
dread
him
he
was
so
quiet
yet
so
strange
she
was
afraid
of
the
man
who
was
not
there
with
her
whom
she
could
feel
behind
this
lover
somebody
sinister
that
filled
her
with
horror
she
began
to
have
a
kind
of
horror
of
him
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
a
criminal
he
wanted
her
he
had
her
and
it
made
her
feel
as
if
death
itself
had
her
in
its
grip
she
lay
in
horror
there
was
no
man
there
loving
her
she
almost
hated
him
then
came
little
bouts
of
tenderness
but
she
dared
not
pity
him
dawes
had
come
to
colonel
seely
home
near
nottingham
there
paul
visited
him
sometimes
clara
very
occasionally
between
the
two
men
the
friendship
developed
peculiarly
dawes
who
mended
very
slowly
and
seemed
very
feeble
seemed
to
leave
himself
in
the
hands
of
morel
in
the
beginning
of
november
clara
reminded
paul
that
it
was
her
birthday
i
nearly
forgotten
he
said
i
thought
quite
she
replied
no
shall
we
go
to
the
seaside
for
the
they
went
it
was
cold
and
rather
dismal
she
waited
for
him
to
be
warm
and
tender
with
her
instead
of
which
he
seemed
hardly
aware
of
her
he
sat
in
the
looking
out
and
was
startled
when
she
spoke
to
him
he
was
not
definitely
thinking
things
seemed
as
if
they
did
not
exist
she
went
across
to
him
what
is
it
dear
she
asked
nothing
he
said
do
those
windmill
sails
look
monotonous
he
sat
holding
her
hand
he
could
not
talk
nor
think
it
was
a
comfort
however
to
sit
holding
her
hand
she
was
dissatisfied
and
miserable
he
was
not
with
her
she
was
nothing
and
in
the
evening
they
sat
among
the
sandhills
looking
at
the
black
heavy
sea
she
will
never
give
in
he
said
quietly
clara
heart
sank
no
she
replied
there
are
different
ways
of
dying
my
father
people
are
frightened
and
have
to
be
hauled
out
of
life
into
death
like
cattle
into
a
pulled
by
the
neck
but
my
mother
people
are
pushed
from
behind
inch
by
inch
they
are
stubborn
people
and
wo
yes
said
clara
and
she
wo
die
she
ca
renshaw
the
parson
was
in
the
other
day
he
said
to
her
will
have
your
mother
and
father
and
your
sisters
and
your
son
in
the
other
land
and
she
said
have
done
without
them
for
a
long
time
and
can
do
without
them
now
it
is
the
living
i
want
not
the
dead
she
wants
to
live
even
oh
how
horrible
said
clara
too
frightened
to
speak
and
she
looks
at
me
and
she
wants
to
stay
with
me
he
went
on
monotonously
she
got
such
a
will
it
seems
as
if
she
would
never
go
never
do
think
of
it
cried
clara
and
she
was
religious
she
is
religious
now
but
it
is
no
good
she
simply
wo
give
in
and
do
you
know
i
said
to
her
on
thursday
if
i
had
to
die
i
die
i
will
to
die
and
she
said
to
me
sharp
you
think
i
have
do
you
think
you
can
die
when
you
like
his
voice
ceased
he
did
not
cry
only
went
on
speaking
monotonously
clara
wanted
to
run
she
looked
round
there
was
the
black
shore
the
dark
sky
down
on
her
she
got
up
terrified
she
wanted
to
be
where
there
was
light
where
there
were
other
people
she
wanted
to
be
away
from
him
he
sat
with
his
head
dropped
not
moving
a
muscle
and
i
do
want
her
to
eat
he
said
and
she
knows
it
when
i
ask
her
you
have
anything
she
almost
afraid
to
say
have
a
cup
of
benger
she
says
only
keep
your
strength
up
i
said
to
her
and
she
almost
cried
there
such
a
gnawing
when
i
eat
nothing
i
ca
bear
it
so
i
went
and
made
her
the
food
it
the
cancer
that
gnaws
like
that
at
her
i
wish
she
die
come
said
clara
roughly
i
he
followed
her
down
the
darkness
of
the
sands
he
did
not
come
to
her
he
seemed
scarcely
aware
of
her
existence
and
she
was
afraid
of
him
and
disliked
him
in
the
same
acute
daze
they
went
back
to
nottingham
he
was
always
busy
always
doing
something
always
going
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
friends
on
the
monday
he
went
to
see
baxter
dawes
listless
and
pale
the
man
rose
to
greet
the
other
clinging
to
his
chair
as
he
held
out
his
hand
you
should
get
up
said
paul
dawes
sat
down
heavily
eyeing
morel
with
a
sort
of
suspicion
do
you
waste
your
time
on
me
he
said
if
you
owt
better
to
i
wanted
to
come

paul
here

morel
how
your

as
you
did
come
on
i
was
at
skegness
said
paul
i
wanted
a
the
other
looked
at
him
with
dark
eyes
he
seemed
to
be
waiting
not
quite
daring
to
ask
trusting
to
be
told
i
went
with
clara
said
paul
i
knew
as
much
said
dawes
quietly
it
was
an
old
promise
said
paul
you
have
it
your
own
way
said
dawes
this
was
the
first
time
clara
had
been
definitely
mentioned
between
them
nay
said
morel
slowly
she
tired
of
again
dawes
looked
at
him
since
august
she
been
getting
tired
of
me
morel
repeated
the
two
men
were
very
quiet
together
paul
suggested
a
game
of
draughts
they
played
in
silence
i
s
go
abroad
when
my
mother
dead
said
paul
abroad
repeated
dawes
yes
i
do
care
what
i
they
continued
the
game
dawes
was
winning
i
s
have
to
begin
a
new
start
of
some
sort
said
paul
and
you
as
well
i
he
took
one
of
dawes
pieces
i
dunno
where
said
the
other
things
have
to
happen
morel
said
it
no
good
doing
anything
at
least
no
i
do
know
give
me
some
the
two
men
ate
sweets
and
began
another
game
of
draughts
what
made
that
scar
on
your
mouth
asked
dawes
paul
put
his
hand
hastily
to
his
lips
and
looked
over
the
garden
i
had
a
bicycle
accident
he
said
dawes
hand
trembled
as
he
moved
the
piece
you
should
ha
laughed
at
me
he
said
very
low
when
that
night
on
woodborough
road
when
you
and
her
passed
me
you
with
your
hand
on
her
i
never
laughed
at
you
said
paul
dawes
kept
his
fingers
on
the
i
never
knew
you
were
there
till
the
very
second
when
you
passed
said
morel
it
was
that
as
did
me
dawes
said
very
low
paul
took
another
sweet
i
never
laughed
he
said
except
as
i
always
they
finished
the
game
that
night
morel
walked
home
from
nottingham
in
order
to
have
something
to
do
the
furnaces
flared
in
a
red
blotch
over
bulwell
the
black
clouds
were
like
a
low
ceiling
as
he
went
along
the
ten
miles
of
highroad
he
felt
as
if
he
were
walking
out
of
life
between
the
black
levels
of
the
sky
and
the
earth
but
at
the
end
was
only
the
if
he
walked
and
walked
for
ever
there
was
only
that
place
to
come
to
he
was
not
tired
when
he
got
near
home
or
he
did
not
know
it
across
the
field
he
could
see
the
red
firelight
leaping
in
her
bedroom
window
when
she
dead
he
said
to
himself
that
fire
will
go
he
took
off
his
boots
quietly
and
crept
upstairs
his
mothers
door
was
wide
open
because
she
slept
alone
still
the
red
firelight
dashed
its
glow
on
the
landing
soft
as
a
shadow
he
peeped
in
her
doorway
paul
she
murmured
his
heart
seemed
to
break
again
he
went
in
and
sat
by
the
bed
how
late
you
are
she
murmured
not
very
he
said
why
what
time
is
it
the
murmur
came
plaintive
and
helpless
it
only
just
gone
that
was
not
true
it
was
nearly
one
oh
she
said
i
thought
it
was
and
he
knew
the
unutterable
misery
of
her
nights
that
would
not
go
ca
you
sleep
my
pigeon
he
said
no
i
ca
she
wailed
never
mind
little
he
said
crooning
never
mind
my
love
i
stop
with
you
half
an
hour
my
pigeon
then
perhaps
it
will
be
and
he
sat
by
the
bedside
slowly
rhythmically
stroking
her
brows
with
his
stroking
her
eyes
shut
soothing
her
holding
her
fingers
in
his
free
hand
they
could
hear
the
sleepers
breathing
in
the
other
rooms
now
go
to
bed
she
murmured
lying
quite
still
under
his
fingers
and
his
love
will
you
sleep
he
asked
yes
i
think
you
feel
better
my
little
do
you
yes
she
said
like
a
fretful
child
still
the
days
and
the
weeks
went
by
he
hardly
ever
went
to
see
clara
now
but
he
wandered
restlessly
from
one
person
to
another
for
some
help
and
there
was
none
anywhere
miriam
had
written
to
him
tenderly
he
went
to
see
her
her
heart
was
very
sore
when
she
saw
him
white
gaunt
with
his
eyes
dark
and
bewildered
her
pity
came
up
hurting
her
till
she
could
not
bear
it
how
is
she
she
asked
the
same
the
same
he
said
the
doctor
says
she
ca
last
but
i
know
she
will
she
be
here
at
miriam
shuddered
she
drew
him
to
her
she
pressed
him
to
her
bosom
she
kissed
him
and
kissed
him
he
submitted
but
it
was
torture
she
could
not
kiss
his
agony
that
remained
alone
and
apart
she
kissed
his
face
and
roused
his
blood
while
his
soul
was
apart
writhing
with
the
agony
of
death
and
she
kissed
him
and
fingered
his
body
till
at
last
feeling
he
would
go
mad
he
got
away
from
her
it
was
not
what
he
wanted
just
then
not
that
and
she
thought
she
had
soothed
him
and
done
him
good
december
came
and
some
snow
he
stayed
at
home
all
the
while
now
they
could
not
afford
a
nurse
annie
came
to
look
after
her
mother
the
parish
nurse
whom
they
loved
came
in
morning
and
evening
paul
shared
the
nursing
with
annie
often
in
the
evenings
when
friends
were
in
the
kitchen
with
them
they
all
laughed
together
and
shook
with
laughter
it
was
reaction
paul
was
so
comical
annie
was
so
quaint
the
whole
party
laughed
till
they
cried
trying
to
subdue
the
sound
and
morel
lying
alone
in
the
darkness
heard
them
and
among
her
bitterness
was
a
feeling
of
relief
then
paul
would
go
upstairs
gingerly
guiltily
to
see
if
she
had
heard
shall
i
give
you
some
milk
he
asked
a
little
she
replied
plaintively
and
he
would
put
some
water
with
it
so
that
it
should
not
nourish
her
yet
he
loved
her
more
than
his
own
life
she
had
morphia
every
night
and
her
heart
got
fitful
annie
slept
beside
her
paul
would
go
in
in
the
early
morning
when
his
sister
got
up
his
mother
was
wasted
and
almost
ashen
in
the
morning
with
the
morphia
darker
and
darker
grew
her
eyes
all
pupil
with
the
torture
in
the
mornings
the
weariness
and
ache
were
too
much
to
bear
yet
she
could
not
would
not
weep
or
even
complain
much
you
slept
a
bit
later
this
morning
little
one
he
would
say
to
her
did
i
she
answered
with
fretful
weariness
yes
it
nearly
eight
he
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
the
whole
country
was
bleak
and
pallid
under
the
snow
then
he
felt
her
pulse
there
was
a
strong
stroke
and
a
weak
one
like
a
sound
and
its
echo
that
was
supposed
to
betoken
the
end
she
let
him
feel
her
wrist
knowing
what
he
wanted
sometimes
they
looked
in
each
other
eyes
then
they
almost
seemed
to
make
an
agreement
it
was
almost
as
if
he
were
agreeing
to
die
also
but
she
did
not
consent
to
die
she
would
not
her
body
was
wasted
to
a
fragment
of
ash
her
eyes
were
dark
and
full
of
torture
ca
you
give
her
something
to
put
an
end
to
it
he
asked
the
doctor
at
last
but
the
doctor
shook
his
head
she
ca
last
many
days
now
morel
he
said
paul
went
indoors
i
ca
bear
it
much
longer
we
shall
all
go
mad
said
annie
the
two
sat
down
to
breakfast
go
and
sit
with
her
while
we
have
breakfast
minnie
said
annie
but
the
girl
was
frightened
paul
went
through
the
country
through
the
woods
over
the
snow
he
saw
the
marks
of
rabbits
and
birds
in
the
white
snow
he
wandered
miles
and
miles
a
smoky
red
sunset
came
on
slowly
painfully
lingering
he
thought
she
would
die
that
day
there
was
a
donkey
that
came
up
to
him
over
the
snow
by
the
wood
edge
and
put
its
head
against
him
and
walked
with
him
alongside
he
put
his
arms
round
the
donkey
neck
and
stroked
his
cheeks
against
his
ears
his
mother
silent
was
still
alive
with
her
hard
mouth
gripped
grimly
her
eyes
of
dark
torture
only
living
it
was
nearing
christmas
there
was
more
snow
annie
and
he
felt
as
if
they
could
go
on
no
more
still
her
dark
eyes
were
alive
morel
silent
and
frightened
obliterated
himself
sometimes
he
would
go
into
the
and
look
at
her
then
he
backed
out
bewildered
she
kept
her
hold
on
life
still
the
miners
had
been
out
on
strike
and
returned
a
fortnight
or
so
before
christmas
minnie
went
upstairs
with
the
it
was
two
days
after
the
men
had
been
in
have
the
men
been
saying
their
hands
are
sore
minnie
she
asked
in
the
faint
querulous
voice
that
would
not
give
in
minnie
stood
surprised
not
as
i
know
of
morel
she
answered
but
i
bet
they
are
sore
said
the
dying
woman
as
she
moved
her
head
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
but
at
any
rate
there
be
something
to
buy
in
with
this
not
a
thing
did
she
let
slip
your
father
pit
things
will
want
well
airing
annie
she
said
when
the
men
were
going
back
to
work
do
you
bother
about
that
my
dear
said
annie
one
night
annie
and
paul
were
alone
nurse
was
upstairs
she
live
over
christmas
said
annie
they
were
both
full
of
horror
she
wo
he
replied
grimly
i
s
give
her
which
said
annie
all
that
came
from
sheffield
said
paul
ay
do
said
annie
the
next
day
he
was
painting
in
the
bedroom
she
seemed
to
be
asleep
he
stepped
softly
backwards
and
forwards
at
his
painting
suddenly
her
small
voice
wailed
do
walk
about
he
looked
round
her
eyes
like
dark
bubbles
in
her
face
were
looking
at
him
no
my
dear
he
said
gently
another
fibre
seemed
to
snap
in
his
heart
that
evening
he
got
all
the
morphia
pills
there
were
and
took
them
downstairs
carefully
he
crushed
them
to
powder
what
are
you
doing
said
annie
i
s
put
in
her
night
then
they
both
laughed
together
like
two
conspiring
children
on
top
of
all
their
horror
flicked
this
little
sanity
nurse
did
not
come
that
night
to
settle
morel
down
paul
went
up
with
the
hot
milk
in
a
it
was
nine
she
was
reared
up
in
bed
and
he
put
the
between
her
lips
that
he
would
have
died
to
save
from
any
hurt
she
took
a
sip
then
put
the
spout
of
the
cup
away
and
looked
at
him
with
her
dark
wondering
eyes
he
looked
at
her
oh
it
is
bitter
paul
she
said
making
a
little
grimace
it
a
new
sleeping
draught
the
doctor
gave
me
for
you
he
said
he
thought
it
would
leave
you
in
such
a
state
in
the
and
i
hope
it
wo
she
said
like
a
child
she
drank
some
more
of
the
milk
but
it
is
horrid
she
said
he
saw
her
frail
fingers
over
the
cup
her
lips
making
a
little
move
i
know
i
tasted
it
he
said
but
i
give
you
some
clean
milk
i
think
so
she
said
and
she
went
on
with
the
draught
she
was
obedient
to
him
like
a
child
he
wondered
if
she
knew
he
saw
her
poor
wasted
throat
moving
as
she
drank
with
difficulty
then
he
ran
downstairs
for
more
milk
there
were
no
grains
in
the
bottom
of
the
cup
has
she
had
it
whispered
annie
yes
and
she
said
it
was
oh
laughed
annie
putting
her
under
lip
between
her
teeth
and
i
told
her
it
was
a
new
draught
where
that
milk
they
both
went
upstairs
i
wonder
why
nurse
did
come
to
settle
me
down
complained
the
mother
like
a
child
wistfully
she
said
she
was
going
to
a
concert
my
love
replied
annie
did
she
they
were
silent
a
minute
morel
gulped
the
little
clean
milk
annie
that
draught
was
horrid
she
said
plaintively
was
it
my
love
well
never
the
mother
sighed
again
with
weariness
her
pulse
was
very
irregular
let
us
settle
you
down
said
annie
perhaps
nurse
will
be
so
ay
said
the
mother
they
turned
the
clothes
back
paul
saw
his
mother
like
a
girl
curled
up
in
her
flannel
nightdress
quickly
they
made
one
half
of
the
bed
moved
her
made
the
other
straightened
her
nightgown
over
her
small
feet
and
covered
her
up
there
said
paul
stroking
her
softly
there
now
you
yes
she
said
i
did
think
you
could
do
the
bed
so
nicely
she
added
almost
gaily
then
she
curled
up
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
her
head
snugged
between
her
shoulders
paul
put
the
long
thin
plait
of
grey
hair
over
her
shoulder
and
kissed
her
you
sleep
my
love
he
said
yes
she
answered
trustfully
they
put
out
the
light
and
it
was
still
morel
was
in
bed
nurse
did
not
come
annie
and
paul
came
to
look
at
her
at
about
eleven
she
seemed
to
be
sleeping
as
usual
after
her
draught
her
mouth
had
come
a
bit
open
shall
we
sit
up
said
paul
i
s
lie
with
her
as
i
always
do
said
annie
she
might
wake
all
right
and
call
me
if
you
see
any
they
lingered
before
the
bedroom
fire
feeling
the
night
big
and
black
and
snowy
outside
their
two
selves
alone
in
the
world
at
last
he
went
into
the
next
room
and
went
to
bed
he
slept
almost
immediately
but
kept
waking
every
now
and
again
then
he
went
sound
asleep
he
started
awake
at
annie
whispered
paul
paul
he
saw
his
sister
in
her
white
nightdress
with
her
long
plait
of
hair
down
her
back
standing
in
the
darkness
yes
he
whispered
sitting
up
come
and
look
at
he
slipped
out
of
bed
a
bud
of
gas
was
burning
in
the
sick
chamber
his
mother
lay
with
her
cheek
on
her
hand
curled
up
as
she
had
gone
to
sleep
but
her
mouth
had
fallen
open
and
she
breathed
with
great
hoarse
breaths
like
snoring
and
there
were
long
intervals
between
she
going
he
whispered
yes
said
annie
how
long
has
she
been
like
it
i
only
just
woke
annie
huddled
into
the
paul
wrapped
himself
in
a
brown
blanket
it
was
three
he
mended
the
fire
then
the
two
sat
waiting
the
great
snoring
breath
was
taken
held
awhile
then
given
back
there
was
a
space
a
long
space
then
they
started
the
great
snoring
breath
was
taken
again
he
bent
close
down
and
looked
at
her
is
it
awful
whispered
annie
he
nodded
they
sat
down
again
helplessly
again
came
the
great
snoring
breath
again
they
hung
suspended
again
it
was
given
back
long
and
harsh
the
sound
so
irregular
at
such
wide
intervals
sounded
through
the
house
morel
in
his
room
slept
on
paul
and
annie
sat
crouched
huddled
motionless
the
great
snoring
sound
began
again
there
was
a
painful
pause
while
the
breath
was
held
back
came
the
rasping
breath
minute
after
minute
passed
paul
looked
at
her
again
bending
low
over
her
she
may
last
like
this
he
said
they
were
both
silent
he
looked
out
of
the
window
and
could
faintly
discern
the
snow
on
the
garden
you
go
to
my
bed
he
said
to
annie
i
sit
no
she
said
i
stop
with
i
rather
you
did
he
said
at
last
annie
crept
out
of
the
room
and
he
was
alone
he
hugged
himself
in
his
brown
blanket
crouched
in
front
of
his
mother
watching
she
looked
dreadful
with
the
bottom
jaw
fallen
back
he
watched
sometimes
he
thought
the
great
breath
would
never
begin
again
he
could
not
bear
it
the
waiting
then
suddenly
startling
him
came
the
great
harsh
sound
he
mended
the
fire
again
noiselessly
she
must
not
be
disturbed
the
minutes
went
by
the
night
was
going
breath
by
breath
each
time
the
sound
came
he
felt
it
wring
him
till
at
last
he
could
not
feel
so
much
his
father
got
up
paul
heard
the
miner
drawing
his
stockings
on
yawning
then
morel
in
shirt
and
stockings
entered
hush
said
paul
morel
stood
watching
then
he
looked
at
his
son
helplessly
and
in
horror
had
i
better
stop
he
whispered
no
go
to
work
she
last
through
i
do
think
yes
go
to
the
miner
looked
at
her
again
in
fear
and
went
obediently
out
of
the
room
paul
saw
the
tape
of
his
garters
swinging
against
his
legs
after
another
paul
went
downstairs
and
drank
a
cup
of
tea
then
returned
morel
dressed
for
the
pit
came
upstairs
again
am
i
to
go
he
said
and
in
a
few
minutes
paul
heard
his
father
heavy
steps
go
thudding
over
the
deadening
snow
miners
called
in
the
streets
as
they
tramped
in
gangs
to
work
the
terrible
breaths
continued
heave
heave
heave
then
a
long
pause
then
as
it
came
back
far
away
over
the
snow
sounded
the
hooters
of
the
ironworks
one
after
another
they
crowed
and
boomed
some
small
and
far
away
some
near
the
blowers
of
the
collieries
and
the
other
works
then
there
was
silence
he
mended
the
fire
the
great
breaths
broke
the
silence
she
looked
just
the
same
he
put
back
the
blind
and
peered
out
still
it
was
dark
perhaps
there
was
a
lighter
tinge
perhaps
the
snow
was
bluer
he
drew
up
the
blind
and
got
dressed
then
shuddering
he
drank
brandy
from
the
bottle
on
the
the
snow
was
growing
blue
he
heard
a
cart
clanking
down
the
street
yes
it
was
seven
and
it
was
coming
a
little
bit
light
he
heard
some
people
calling
the
world
was
waking
a
grey
deathly
dawn
crept
over
the
snow
yes
he
could
see
the
houses
he
put
out
the
gas
it
seemed
very
dark
the
breathing
came
still
but
he
was
almost
used
to
it
he
could
see
her
she
was
just
the
same
he
wondered
if
he
piled
heavy
clothes
on
top
of
her
it
would
stop
he
looked
at
her
that
was
not
her
not
her
a
bit
if
he
piled
the
blanket
and
heavy
coats
on
her
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
annie
entered
she
looked
at
him
questioningly
just
the
same
he
said
calmly
they
whispered
together
a
minute
then
he
went
downstairs
to
get
breakfast
it
was
twenty
to
eight
soon
annie
came
down
is
it
awful
does
she
look
awful
she
whispered
dazed
with
horror
he
nodded
if
she
looks
like
that
said
annie
drink
some
tea
he
said
they
went
upstairs
again
soon
the
neighbours
came
with
their
frightened
question
how
is
she
it
went
on
just
the
same
she
lay
with
her
cheek
in
her
hand
her
mouth
fallen
open
and
the
great
ghastly
snores
came
and
went
at
ten
nurse
came
she
looked
strange
and
woebegone
nurse
cried
paul
she
last
like
this
for
days
she
ca
morel
said
nurse
she
there
was
a
silence
is
it
dreadful
wailed
the
nurse
who
would
have
thought
she
could
stand
it
go
down
now
morel
go
at
last
at
about
eleven
he
went
downstairs
and
sat
in
the
neighbour
house
annie
was
downstairs
also
nurse
and
arthur
were
upstairs
paul
sat
with
his
head
in
his
hand
suddenly
annie
came
flying
across
the
yard
crying
half
mad
paul
paul
she
gone
in
a
second
he
was
back
in
his
own
house
and
upstairs
she
lay
curled
up
and
still
with
her
face
on
her
hand
and
nurse
was
wiping
her
mouth
they
all
stood
back
he
kneeled
down
and
put
his
face
to
hers
and
his
arms
round
her
my
love
my
love
oh
my
love
he
whispered
again
and
again
my
love
oh
my
love
then
he
heard
the
nurse
behind
him
crying
saying
she
better
morel
she
when
he
took
his
face
up
from
his
warm
dead
mother
he
went
straight
downstairs
and
began
blacking
his
boots
there
was
a
good
deal
to
do
letters
to
write
and
so
on
the
doctor
came
and
glanced
at
her
and
sighed
ay
poor
thing
he
said
then
turned
away
well
call
at
the
surgery
about
six
for
the
the
father
came
home
from
work
at
about
four
he
dragged
silently
into
the
house
and
sat
down
minnie
bustled
to
give
him
his
dinner
tired
he
laid
his
black
arms
on
the
table
there
were
swede
turnips
for
his
dinner
which
he
liked
paul
wondered
if
he
knew
it
was
some
time
and
nobody
had
spoken
at
last
the
son
said
you
noticed
the
blinds
were
down
morel
looked
up
no
he
said
why
has
she
gone
when
wor
that
about
twelve
this
h
the
miner
sat
still
for
a
moment
then
began
his
dinner
it
was
as
if
nothing
had
happened
he
ate
his
turnips
in
silence
afterwards
he
washed
and
went
upstairs
to
dress
the
door
of
her
room
was
shut
have
you
seen
her
annie
asked
of
him
when
he
came
down
no
he
said
in
a
little
while
he
went
out
annie
went
away
and
paul
called
on
the
undertaker
the
clergyman
the
doctor
the
registrar
it
was
a
long
business
he
got
back
at
nearly
eight
the
undertaker
was
coming
soon
to
measure
for
the
coffin
the
house
was
empty
except
for
her
he
took
a
candle
and
went
upstairs
the
room
was
cold
that
had
been
warm
for
so
long
flowers
bottles
plates
all
litter
was
taken
away
everything
was
harsh
and
austere
she
lay
raised
on
the
bed
the
sweep
of
the
sheet
from
the
raised
feet
was
like
a
clean
curve
of
snow
so
silent
she
lay
like
a
maiden
asleep
with
his
candle
in
his
hand
he
bent
over
her
she
lay
like
a
girl
asleep
and
dreaming
of
her
love
the
mouth
was
a
little
open
as
if
wondering
from
the
suffering
but
her
face
was
young
her
brow
clear
and
white
as
if
life
had
never
touched
it
he
looked
again
at
the
eyebrows
at
the
small
winsome
nose
a
bit
on
one
side
she
was
young
again
only
the
hair
as
it
arched
so
beautifully
from
her
temples
was
mixed
with
silver
and
the
two
simple
plaits
that
lay
on
her
shoulders
were
filigree
of
silver
and
brown
she
would
wake
up
she
would
lift
her
eyelids
she
was
with
him
still
he
bent
and
kissed
her
passionately
but
there
was
coldness
against
his
mouth
he
bit
his
lips
with
horror
looking
at
her
he
felt
he
could
never
never
let
her
go
no
he
stroked
the
hair
from
her
temples
that
too
was
cold
he
saw
the
mouth
so
dumb
and
wondering
at
the
hurt
then
he
crouched
on
the
floor
whispering
to
her
mother
mother
he
was
still
with
her
when
the
undertakers
came
young
men
who
had
been
to
school
with
him
they
touched
her
reverently
and
in
a
quiet
businesslike
fashion
they
did
not
look
at
her
he
watched
jealously
he
and
annie
guarded
her
fiercely
they
would
not
let
anybody
come
to
see
her
and
the
neighbours
were
offended
after
a
while
paul
went
out
of
the
house
and
played
cards
at
a
friend
it
was
midnight
when
he
got
back
his
father
rose
from
the
couch
as
he
entered
saying
in
a
plaintive
way
i
thought
tha
wor
niver
comin
i
did
think
you
sit
up
said
paul
his
father
looked
so
forlorn
morel
had
been
a
man
without
fear
simply
nothing
frightened
him
paul
realised
with
a
start
that
he
had
been
afraid
to
go
to
bed
alone
in
the
house
with
his
dead
he
was
sorry
i
forgot
you
be
alone
father
he
said
dost
want
owt
to
eat
asked
morel
sithee
i
made
thee
a
drop
o
hot
milk
get
it
down
thee
it
cold
enough
for
paul
drank
it
after
a
while
morel
went
to
bed
he
hurried
past
the
closed
door
and
left
his
own
door
open
soon
the
son
came
upstairs
also
he
went
in
to
kiss
her
as
usual
it
was
cold
and
dark
he
wished
they
had
kept
her
fire
burning
still
she
dreamed
her
young
dream
but
she
would
be
cold
my
dear
he
whispered
my
dear
and
he
did
not
kiss
her
for
fear
she
should
be
cold
and
strange
to
him
it
eased
him
she
slept
so
beautifully
he
shut
her
door
softly
not
to
wake
her
and
went
to
bed
in
the
morning
morel
summoned
his
courage
hearing
annie
downstairs
and
paul
coughing
in
the
room
across
the
landing
he
opened
her
door
and
went
into
the
darkened
room
he
saw
the
white
uplifted
form
in
the
twilight
but
her
he
dared
not
see
bewildered
too
frightened
to
possess
any
of
his
faculties
he
got
out
of
the
room
again
and
left
her
he
never
looked
at
her
again
he
had
not
seen
her
for
months
because
he
had
not
dared
to
look
and
she
looked
like
his
young
wife
again
have
you
seen
her
annie
asked
of
him
sharply
after
breakfast
yes
he
said
and
do
you
think
she
looks
nice
he
went
out
of
the
house
soon
after
and
all
the
time
he
seemed
to
be
creeping
aside
to
avoid
it
paul
went
about
from
place
to
place
doing
the
business
of
the
death
he
met
clara
in
nottingham
and
they
had
tea
together
in
a
cafe
when
they
were
quite
jolly
again
she
was
infinitely
relieved
to
find
he
did
not
take
it
tragically
later
when
the
relatives
began
to
come
for
the
funeral
the
affair
became
public
and
the
children
became
social
beings
they
put
themselves
aside
they
buried
her
in
a
furious
storm
of
rain
and
wind
the
wet
clay
glistened
all
the
white
flowers
were
soaked
annie
gripped
his
arm
and
leaned
forward
down
below
she
saw
a
dark
corner
of
william
coffin
the
oak
box
sank
steadily
she
was
gone
the
rain
poured
in
the
grave
the
procession
of
black
with
its
umbrellas
glistening
turned
away
the
cemetery
was
deserted
under
the
drenching
cold
rain
paul
went
home
and
busied
himself
supplying
the
guests
with
drinks
his
father
sat
in
the
kitchen
with
morel
relatives
superior
people
and
wept
and
said
what
a
good
lass
she
been
and
how
tried
to
do
everything
he
could
for
her
everything
he
had
striven
all
his
life
to
do
what
he
could
for
her
and
he
nothing
to
reproach
himself
with
she
was
gone
but
he
done
his
best
for
her
he
wiped
his
eyes
with
his
white
handkerchief
he
nothing
to
reproach
himself
for
he
repeated
all
his
life
he
done
his
best
for
her
and
that
was
how
he
tried
to
dismiss
her
he
never
thought
of
her
personally
everything
deep
in
him
he
denied
paul
hated
his
father
for
sitting
sentimentalising
over
her
he
knew
he
would
do
it
in
the
for
the
real
tragedy
went
on
in
morel
in
spite
of
himself
sometimes
later
he
came
down
from
his
afternoon
sleep
white
and
cowering
i
have
been
dreaming
of
thy
mother
he
said
in
a
small
voice
have
you
father
when
i
dream
of
her
it
always
just
as
she
was
when
she
was
well
i
dream
of
her
often
but
it
seems
quite
nice
and
natural
as
if
nothing
had
but
morel
crouched
in
front
of
the
fire
in
terror
the
weeks
passed
not
much
pain
not
much
of
anything
perhaps
a
little
relief
mostly
a
paul
went
restless
from
place
to
place
for
some
months
since
his
mother
had
been
worse
he
had
not
made
love
to
clara
she
was
as
it
were
dumb
to
him
rather
distant
dawes
saw
her
very
occasionally
but
the
two
could
not
get
an
inch
across
the
great
distance
between
them
the
three
of
them
were
drifting
forward
dawes
mended
very
slowly
he
was
in
the
convalescent
home
at
skegness
at
christmas
nearly
well
again
paul
went
to
the
seaside
for
a
few
days
his
father
was
with
annie
in
sheffield
dawes
came
to
paul
lodgings
his
time
in
the
home
was
up
the
two
men
between
whom
was
such
a
big
reserve
seemed
faithful
to
each
other
dawes
depended
on
morel
now
he
knew
paul
and
clara
had
practically
separated
two
days
after
christmas
paul
was
to
go
back
to
nottingham
the
evening
before
he
sat
with
dawes
smoking
before
the
fire
you
know
clara
coming
down
for
the
day
he
said
the
other
man
glanced
at
him
yes
you
told
me
he
replied
paul
drank
the
remainder
of
his
glass
of
whisky
i
told
the
landlady
your
wife
was
coming
he
said
did
you
said
dawes
shrinking
but
almost
leaving
himself
in
the
other
hands
he
got
up
rather
stiffly
and
reached
for
morel
glass
let
me
fill
you
up
he
said
paul
jumped
up
you
sit
still
he
said
but
dawes
with
rather
shaky
hand
continued
to
mix
the
drink
say
when
he
said
thanks
replied
the
other
but
you
no
business
to
get
it
does
me
good
lad
replied
dawes
i
begin
to
think
i
right
again
you
are
about
right
you
i
am
certainly
i
am
said
dawes
nodding
to
him
and
len
says
he
can
get
you
on
in
dawes
glanced
at
him
again
with
dark
eyes
that
agreed
with
everything
the
other
would
say
perhaps
a
trifle
dominated
by
him
it
funny
said
paul
starting
again
i
feel
in
a
lot
bigger
mess
than
in
what
way
lad
i
do
know
i
do
know
it
as
if
i
was
in
a
tangled
sort
of
hole
rather
dark
and
dreary
and
no
road
i
know
i
understand
it
dawes
said
nodding
but
you
find
come
all
he
spoke
caressingly
i
suppose
so
said
paul
dawes
knocked
his
pipe
in
a
hopeless
fashion
you
not
done
for
yourself
like
i
have
he
said
morel
saw
the
wrist
and
the
white
hand
of
the
other
man
gripping
the
stem
of
the
pipe
and
knocking
out
the
ash
as
if
he
had
given
up
how
old
are
you
paul
asked
replied
dawes
glancing
at
him
those
brown
eyes
full
of
the
consciousness
of
failure
almost
pleading
for
reassurance
for
someone
to
the
man
in
himself
to
warm
him
to
set
him
up
firm
again
troubled
paul
you
just
be
in
your
prime
said
morel
you
do
look
as
if
much
life
had
gone
out
of
the
brown
eyes
of
the
other
flashed
suddenly
it
has
he
said
the
go
is
paul
looked
up
and
laughed
we
both
got
plenty
of
life
in
us
yet
to
make
things
fly
he
said
the
eyes
of
the
two
men
met
they
exchanged
one
look
having
recognised
the
stress
of
passion
each
in
the
other
they
both
drank
their
whisky
yes
begod
said
dawes
breathless
there
was
a
pause
and
i
do
see
said
paul
why
you
should
go
on
where
you
left
what
said
dawes
suggestively
yes
fit
your
old
home
together
dawes
hid
his
face
and
shook
his
head
could
be
done
he
said
and
looked
up
with
an
ironic
smile
why
because
you
do
want
they
smoked
in
silence
dawes
showed
his
teeth
as
he
bit
his
pipe
stem
you
mean
you
do
want
her
asked
paul
dawes
stared
up
at
the
picture
with
a
caustic
expression
on
his
face
i
hardly
know
he
said
the
smoke
floated
softly
up
i
believe
she
wants
you
said
paul
do
you
replied
the
other
soft
satirical
abstract
yes
she
never
really
hitched
on
to
me
you
were
always
there
in
the
background
that
why
she
would
get
a
dawes
continued
to
stare
in
a
satirical
fashion
at
the
picture
over
the
mantelpiece
that
how
women
are
with
me
said
paul
they
want
me
like
mad
but
they
do
want
to
belong
to
me
and
she
belonged
to
you
all
the
time
i
the
triumphant
male
came
up
in
dawes
he
showed
his
teeth
more
distinctly
perhaps
i
was
a
fool
he
said
you
were
a
big
fool
said
morel
but
perhaps
even
then
you
were
a
bigger
fool
said
dawes
there
was
a
touch
of
triumph
and
malice
in
it
do
you
think
so
said
paul
they
were
silent
for
some
time
at
any
rate
i
clearing
out
said
morel
i
see
answered
dawes
then
they
did
not
talk
any
more
the
instinct
to
murder
each
other
had
returned
they
almost
avoided
each
other
they
shared
the
same
bedroom
when
they
retired
dawes
seemed
abstract
thinking
of
something
he
sat
on
the
side
of
the
bed
in
his
shirt
looking
at
his
legs
are
you
getting
cold
asked
morel
i
was
lookin
at
these
legs
replied
the
other
what
up
with
they
look
all
right
replied
paul
from
his
bed
they
look
all
right
but
there
some
water
in
and
what
about
it
come
and
paul
reluctantly
got
out
of
bed
and
went
to
look
at
the
rather
handsome
legs
of
the
other
man
that
were
covered
with
glistening
dark
gold
hair
look
here
said
dawes
pointing
to
his
shin
look
at
the
water
under
where
said
paul
the
man
pressed
in
his
they
left
little
dents
that
filled
up
slowly
it
nothing
said
paul
you
feel
said
dawes
paul
tried
with
his
fingers
it
made
little
dents
h
he
said
rotten
is
it
said
dawes
why
it
nothing
you
not
much
of
a
man
with
water
in
your
i
ca
see
as
it
makes
any
difference
said
morel
i
got
a
weak
he
returned
to
his
own
bed
i
suppose
the
rest
of
me
all
right
said
dawes
and
he
put
out
the
light
in
the
morning
it
was
raining
morel
packed
his
bag
the
sea
was
grey
and
shaggy
and
dismal
he
seemed
to
be
cutting
himself
off
from
life
more
and
more
it
gave
him
a
wicked
pleasure
to
do
it
the
two
men
were
at
the
station
clara
stepped
out
of
the
train
and
came
along
the
platform
very
erect
and
coldly
composed
she
wore
a
long
coat
and
a
tweed
hat
both
men
hated
her
for
her
composure
paul
shook
hands
with
her
at
the
barrier
dawes
was
leaning
against
the
bookstall
watching
his
black
overcoat
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
because
of
the
rain
he
was
pale
with
almost
a
touch
of
nobility
in
his
quietness
he
came
forward
limping
slightly
you
ought
to
look
better
than
this
she
said
oh
i
all
right
the
three
stood
at
a
loss
she
kept
the
two
men
hesitating
near
her
shall
we
go
to
the
lodging
straight
off
said
paul
or
somewhere
else
we
may
as
well
go
home
said
dawes
paul
walked
on
the
outside
of
the
pavement
then
dawes
then
clara
they
made
polite
conversation
the
faced
the
sea
whose
tide
grey
and
shaggy
hissed
not
far
off
morel
swung
up
the
big
sit
down
jack
he
said
i
do
want
that
chair
said
dawes
sit
down
morel
repeated
clara
took
off
her
things
and
laid
them
on
the
couch
she
had
a
slight
air
of
resentment
lifting
her
hair
with
her
fingers
she
sat
down
rather
aloof
and
composed
paul
ran
downstairs
to
speak
to
the
landlady
i
should
think
you
cold
said
dawes
to
his
wife
come
nearer
to
the
thank
you
i
quite
warm
she
answered
she
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
rain
and
at
the
sea
when
are
you
going
back
she
asked
well
the
rooms
are
taken
until
so
he
wants
me
to
stop
going
back
and
then
you
thinking
of
going
to
sheffield
are
you
fit
to
start
work
i
going
to
you
really
got
a
place
yes
begin
on
you
do
look
why
do
i
she
looked
again
out
of
the
window
instead
of
answering
and
have
you
got
lodgings
in
sheffield
again
she
looked
away
out
of
the
window
the
panes
were
blurred
with
streaming
rain
and
can
you
manage
all
right
she
asked
i
s
think
so
i
s
have
to
they
were
silent
when
morel
returned
i
shall
go
by
the
he
said
as
he
entered
nobody
answered
i
wish
you
take
your
boots
off
he
said
to
clara
there
a
pair
of
slippers
of
thank
you
she
said
they
are
he
put
the
slippers
near
her
feet
she
left
them
there
morel
sat
down
both
the
men
seemed
helpless
and
each
of
them
had
a
rather
hunted
look
but
dawes
now
carried
himself
quietly
seemed
to
yield
himself
while
paul
seemed
to
screw
himself
up
clara
thought
she
had
never
seen
him
look
so
small
and
mean
he
was
as
if
trying
to
get
himself
into
the
smallest
possible
compass
and
as
he
went
about
arranging
and
as
he
sat
talking
there
seemed
something
false
about
him
and
out
of
tune
watching
him
unknown
she
said
to
herself
there
was
no
stability
about
him
he
was
fine
in
his
way
passionate
and
able
to
give
her
drinks
of
pure
life
when
he
was
in
one
mood
and
now
he
looked
paltry
and
insignificant
there
was
nothing
stable
about
him
her
husband
had
more
manly
dignity
at
any
rate
he
did
not
waft
about
with
any
wind
there
was
something
evanescent
about
morel
she
thought
something
shifting
and
false
he
would
never
make
sure
ground
for
any
woman
to
stand
on
she
despised
him
rather
for
his
shrinking
together
getting
smaller
her
husband
at
least
was
manly
and
when
he
was
beaten
gave
in
but
this
other
would
never
own
to
being
beaten
he
would
shift
round
and
round
prowl
get
smaller
she
despised
him
and
yet
she
watched
him
rather
than
dawes
and
it
seemed
as
if
their
three
fates
lay
in
his
hands
she
hated
him
for
it
she
seemed
to
understand
better
now
about
men
and
what
they
could
or
would
do
she
was
less
afraid
of
them
more
sure
of
herself
that
they
were
not
the
small
egoists
she
had
imagined
them
made
her
more
comfortable
she
had
learned
a
good
deal
almost
as
much
as
she
wanted
to
learn
her
cup
had
been
full
it
was
still
as
full
as
she
could
carry
on
the
whole
she
would
not
be
sorry
when
he
was
gone
they
had
dinner
and
sat
eating
nuts
and
drinking
by
the
fire
not
a
serious
word
had
been
spoken
yet
clara
realised
that
morel
was
withdrawing
from
the
circle
leaving
her
the
option
to
stay
with
her
husband
it
angered
her
he
was
a
mean
fellow
after
all
to
take
what
he
wanted
and
then
give
her
back
she
did
not
remember
that
she
herself
had
had
what
she
wanted
and
really
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
wished
to
be
given
back
paul
felt
crumpled
up
and
lonely
his
mother
had
really
supported
his
life
he
had
loved
her
they
two
had
in
fact
faced
the
world
together
now
she
was
gone
and
for
ever
behind
him
was
the
gap
in
life
the
tear
in
the
veil
through
which
his
life
seemed
to
drift
slowly
as
if
he
were
drawn
towards
death
he
wanted
someone
of
their
own
free
initiative
to
help
him
the
lesser
things
he
began
to
let
go
from
him
for
fear
of
this
big
thing
the
lapse
towards
death
following
in
the
wake
of
his
beloved
clara
could
not
stand
for
him
to
hold
on
to
she
wanted
him
but
not
to
understand
him
he
felt
she
wanted
the
man
on
top
not
the
real
him
that
was
in
trouble
that
would
be
too
much
trouble
to
her
he
dared
not
give
it
her
she
could
not
cope
with
him
it
made
him
ashamed
so
secretly
ashamed
because
he
was
in
such
a
mess
because
his
own
hold
on
life
was
so
unsure
because
nobody
held
him
feeling
unsubstantial
shadowy
as
if
he
did
not
count
for
much
in
this
concrete
world
he
drew
himself
together
smaller
and
smaller
he
did
not
want
to
die
he
would
not
give
in
but
he
was
not
afraid
of
death
if
nobody
would
help
he
would
go
on
alone
dawes
had
been
driven
to
the
extremity
of
life
until
he
was
afraid
he
could
go
to
the
brink
of
death
he
could
lie
on
the
edge
and
look
in
then
cowed
afraid
he
had
to
crawl
back
and
like
a
beggar
take
what
offered
there
was
a
certain
nobility
in
it
as
clara
saw
he
owned
himself
beaten
and
he
wanted
to
be
taken
back
whether
or
not
that
she
could
do
for
him
it
was
three
i
am
going
by
the
said
paul
again
to
clara
are

or
later
i
do
know
she
said

my
father

nottingham
at
he
said
then
she
answered
i
come
dawes
jerked
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
held
on
a
strain
he
looked
out
over
the
sea
but
he
saw
nothing
there
are
one
or
two
books
in
the
corner
said
morel
i
done
with
at
about
four
he
went
i

said
as
he
shook
hands

said
dawes
an
perhaps
one
day

able
to
pay
you
back

money

i
shall

for
it

laughed
paul
i
s
be
on
the
rocks
before
i
very
much
ay
well
said
dawes
he
said
to
clara
she
said
giving
him
her
hand
then
she
glanced
at
him
for
the
last
time
dumb
and
humble
he
was
gone
dawes
and
his
wife
sat
down
again
it
a
nasty
day
for
travelling
said
the
man
yes
she
answered
they
talked
in
a
desultory
fashion
until
it
grew
dark
the
landlady
brought
in
the
tea
dawes
drew
up
his
chair
to
the
table
without
being
invited
like
a
husband
then
he
sat
humbly
waiting
for
his
cup
she
served
him
as
she
would
like
a
wife
not
consulting
his
wish
after
tea
as
it
drew
near
to
six
he
went
to
the
window
all
was
dark
outside
the
sea
was
roaring
it
raining
yet
he
said
is
it
she
answered
you
wo
go
shall
you
he
said
hesitating
she
did
not
answer
he
waited
i
should
go
in
this
rain
he
said
do
you
want
me
to
stay
she
asked
his
hand
as
he
held
the
dark
curtain
trembled
yes
he
said
he
remained
with
his
back
to
her
she
rose
and
went
slowly
to
him
he
let
go
the
curtain
turned
hesitating
towards
her
she
stood
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
looking
up
at
him
in
a
heavy
inscrutable
fashion
do
you
want
me
baxter
she
asked
his
voice
was
hoarse
as
he
answered
do
you
want
to
come
back
to
me
she
made
a
moaning
noise
lifted
her
arms
and
put
them
round
his
neck
drawing
him
to
her
he
hid
his
face
on
her
shoulder
holding
her
clasped
take
me
back
she
whispered
ecstatic
take
me
back
take
me
back
and
she
put
her
fingers
through
his
fine
thin
dark
hair
as
if
she
were
only
he
tightened
his
grasp
on
her
do
you
want
me
again
he
murmured
broken
chapter
xv
derelict
clara
went
with
her
husband
to
sheffield
and
paul
scarcely
saw
her
again
walter
morel
seemed
to
have
let
all
the
trouble
go
over
him
and
there
he
was
crawling
about
on
the
mud
of
it
just
the
same
there
was
scarcely
any
bond
between
father
and
son
save
that
each
felt
he
must
not
let
the
other
go
in
any
actual
want
as
there
was
no
one
to
keep
on
the
home
and
as
they
could
neither
of
them
bear
the
emptiness
of
the
house
paul
took
lodgings
in
nottingham
and
morel
went
to
live
with
a
friendly
family
in
bestwood
everything
seemed
to
have
gone
smash
for
the
young
man
he
could
not
paint
the
picture
he
finished
on
the
day
of
his
mother
death
one
that
satisfied
him
was
the
last
thing
he
did
at
work
there
was
no
clara
when
he
came
home
he
could
not
take
up
his
brushes
again
there
was
nothing
left
so
he
was
always
in
the
town
at
one
place
or
another
drinking
knocking
about
with
the
men
he
knew
it
really
wearied
him
he
talked
to
barmaids
to
almost
any
woman
but
there
was
that
dark
strained
look
in
his
eyes
as
if
he
were
hunting
something
everything
seemed
so
different
so
unreal
there
seemed
no
reason
why
people
should
go
along
the
street
and
houses
pile
up
in
the
daylight
there
seemed
no
reason
why
these
things
should
occupy
the
space
instead
of
leaving
it
empty
his
friends
talked
to
him
he
heard
the
sounds
and
he
answered
but
why
there
should
be
the
noise
of
speech
he
could
not
understand
he
was
most
himself
when
he
was
alone
or
working
hard
and
mechanically
at
the
factory
in
the
latter
case
there
was
pure
forgetfulness
when
he
lapsed
from
consciousness
but
it
had
to
come
to
an
end
it
hurt
him
so
that
things
had
lost
their
reality
the
first
snowdrops
came
he
saw
the
tiny
among
the
grey
they
would
have
given
him
the
liveliest
emotion
at
one
time
now
they
were
there
but
they
did
not
seem
to
mean
anything
in
a
few
moments
they
would
cease
to
occupy
that
place
and
just
the
space
would
be
where
they
had
been
tall
brilliant
ran
along
the
street
at
night
it
seemed
almost
a
wonder
they
should
trouble
to
rustle
backwards
and
forwards
why
trouble
to
go
tilting
down
to
trent
bridges
he
asked
of
the
big
trams
it
seemed
they
just
as
well
might
not
be
as
be
the
realest
thing
was
the
thick
darkness
at
night
that
seemed
to
him
whole
and
comprehensible
and
restful
he
could
leave
himself
to
it
suddenly
a
piece
of
paper
started
near
his
feet
and
blew
along
down
the
pavement
he
stood
still
rigid
with
clenched
fists
a
flame
of
agony
going
over
him
and
he
saw
again
the
his
mother
her
eyes
unconsciously
he
had
been
with
her
in
her
company
the
swift
hop
of
the
paper
reminded
him
she
was
gone
but
he
had
been
with
her
he
wanted
everything
to
stand
still
so
that
he
could
be
with
her
again
the
days
passed
the
weeks
but
everything
seemed
to
have
fused
gone
into
a
conglomerated
mass
he
could
not
tell
one
day
from
another
one
week
from
another
hardly
one
place
from
another
nothing
was
distinct
or
distinguishable
often
he
lost
himself
for
an
hour
at
a
time
could
not
remember
what
he
had
done
one
evening
he
came
home
late
to
his
lodging
the
fire
was
burning
low
everybody
was
in
bed
he
threw
on
some
more
coal
glanced
at
the
table
and
decided
he
wanted
no
supper
then
he
sat
down
in
the
it
was
perfectly
still
he
did
not
know
anything
yet
he
saw
the
dim
smoke
wavering
up
the
chimney
presently
two
mice
came
out
cautiously
nibbling
the
fallen
crumbs
he
watched
them
as
it
were
from
a
long
way
off
the
church
clock
struck
two
far
away
he
could
hear
the
sharp
clinking
of
the
trucks
on
the
railway
no
it
was
not
they
that
were
far
away
they
were
there
in
their
places
but
where
was
he
himself
the
time
passed
the
two
mice
careering
wildly
scampered
cheekily
over
his
slippers
he
had
not
moved
a
muscle
he
did
not
want
to
move
he
was
not
thinking
of
anything
it
was
easier
so
there
was
no
wrench
of
knowing
anything
then
from
time
to
time
some
other
consciousness
working
mechanically
flashed
into
sharp
phrases
what
am
i
doing
and
out
of
the
trance
came
the
answer
destroying
then
a
dull
live
feeling
gone
in
an
instant
told
him
that
it
was
wrong
after
a
while
suddenly
came
the
question
why
wrong
again
there
was
no
answer
but
a
stroke
of
hot
stubbornness
inside
his
chest
resisted
his
own
annihilation
there
was
a
sound
of
a
heavy
cart
clanking
down
the
road
suddenly
the
electric
light
went
out
there
was
a
bruising
thud
in
the
meter
he
did
not
stir
but
sat
gazing
in
front
of
him
only
the
mice
had
scuttled
and
the
fire
glowed
red
in
the
dark
room
then
quite
mechanically
and
more
distinctly
the
conversation
began
again
inside
him
she
dead
what
was
it
all
for
her
struggle
that
was
his
despair
wanting
to
go
after
her
you
she
she
is
in
suddenly
he
felt
tired
with
the
burden
of
it
you
got
to
keep
alive
for
her
sake
said
his
will
in
him
something
felt
sulky
as
if
it
would
not
rouse
you
got
to
carry
forward
her
living
and
what
she
had
done
go
on
with
but
he
did
not
want
to
he
wanted
to
give
up
but
you
can
go
on
with
your
painting
said
the
will
in
him
or
else
you
can
beget
children
they
both
carry
on
her
painting
is
not
then
marry
whom
came
the
sulky
question
as
best
you
miriam
but
he
did
not
trust
that
he
rose
suddenly
went
straight
to
bed
when
he
got
inside
his
bedroom
and
closed
the
door
he
stood
with
clenched
fist
mater
my
dear
he
began
with
the
whole
force
of
his
soul
then
he
stopped
he
would
not
say
it
he
would
not
admit
that
he
wanted
to
die
to
have
done
he
would
not
own
that
life
had
beaten
him
or
that
death
had
beaten
him
going
straight
to
bed
he
slept
at
once
abandoning
himself
to
the
sleep
so
the
weeks
went
on
always
alone
his
soul
oscillated
first
on
the
side
of
death
then
on
the
side
of
life
doggedly
the
real
agony
was
that
he
had
nowhere
to
go
nothing
to
do
nothing
to
say
and
was
nothing
himself
sometimes
he
ran
down
the
streets
as
if
he
were
mad
sometimes
he
was
mad
things
were
there
things
were
there
it
made
him
pant
sometimes
he
stood
before
the
bar
of
the
where
he
called
for
a
drink
everything
suddenly
stood
back
away
from
him
he
saw
the
face
of
the
barmaid
the
gobbling
drinkers
his
own
glass
on
the
slopped
mahogany
board
in
the
distance
there
was
something
between
him
and
them
he
could
not
get
into
touch
he
did
not
want
them
he
did
not
want
his
drink
turning
abruptly
he
went
out
on
the
threshold
he
stood
and
looked
at
the
lighted
street
but
he
was
not
of
it
or
in
it
something
separated
him
everything
went
on
there
below
those
lamps
shut
away
from
him
he
could
not
get
at
them
he
felt
he
could
touch
the
not
if
he
reached
where
could
he
go
there
was
nowhere
to
go
neither
back
into
the
inn
or
forward
anywhere
he
felt
stifled
there
was
nowhere
for
him
the
stress
grew
inside
him
he
felt
he
should
smash
i
must
he
said
and
turning
blindly
he
went
in
and
drank
sometimes
the
drink
did
him
good
sometimes
it
made
him
worse
he
ran
down
the
road
for
ever
restless
he
went
here
there
everywhere
he
determined
to
work
but
when
he
had
made
six
strokes
he
loathed
the
pencil
violently
got
up
and
went
away
hurried
off
to
a
club
where
he
could
play
cards
or
billiards
to
a
place
where
he
could
flirt
with
a
barmaid
who
was
no
more
to
him
than
the
brass
she
drew
he
was
very
thin
and
he
dared
not
meet
his
own
eyes
in
the
mirror
he
never
looked
at
himself
he
wanted
to
get
away
from
himself
but
there
was
nothing
to
get
hold
of
in
despair
he
thought
of
miriam
perhaps
perhaps
then
happening
to
go
into
the
unitarian
church
one
sunday
evening
when
they
stood
up
to
sing
the
second
hymn
he
saw
her
before
him
the
light
glistened
on
her
lower
lip
as
she
sang
she
looked
as
if
she
had
got
something
at
any
rate
some
hope
in
heaven
if
not
in
earth
her
comfort
and
her
life
seemed
in
the
a
warm
strong
feeling
for
her
came
up
she
seemed
to
yearn
as
she
sang
for
the
mystery
and
comfort
he
put
his
hope
in
her
he
longed
for
the
sermon
to
be
over
to
speak
to
her
the
throng
carried
her
out
just
before
him
he
could
nearly
touch
her
she
did
not
know
he
was
there
he
saw
the
brown
humble
nape
of
her
neck
under
its
black
curls
he
would
leave
himself
to
her
she
was
better
and
bigger
than
he
he
would
depend
on
her
she
went
wandering
in
her
blind
way
through
the
little
throngs
of
people
outside
the
church
she
always
looked
so
lost
and
out
of
place
among
people
he
went
forward
and
put
his
hand
on
her
arm
she
started
violently
her
great
brown
eyes
dilated
in
fear
then
went
questioning
at
the
sight
of
him
he
shrank
slightly
from
her
i
did
know
she
faltered
nor
i
he
said
he
looked
away
his
sudden
flaring
hope
sank
again
what
are
you
doing
in
town
he
asked
i
staying
at
cousin
ha
for
long
no
only
till
must
you
go
straight
home
she
looked
at
him
then
hid
her
face
under
her
no
she
said
no
it
not
he
turned
away
and
she
went
with
him
they
threaded
through
the
throng
of
church
people
the
organ
was
still
sounding
in
mary
dark
figures
came
through
the
lighted
doors
people
were
coming
down
the
steps
the
large
coloured
windows
glowed
up
in
the
night
the
church
was
like
a
great
lantern
suspended
they
went
down
hollow
stone
and
he
took
the
car
for
the
bridges
you
will
just
have
supper
with
me
he
said
then
i
bring
you
very
well
she
replied
low
and
husky
they
scarcely
spoke
while
they
were
on
the
car
the
trent
ran
dark
and
full
under
the
bridge
away
towards
colwick
all
was
black
night
he
lived
down
holme
road
on
the
naked
edge
of
the
town
facing
across
the
river
meadows
towards
sneinton
hermitage
and
the
steep
scrap
of
colwick
wood
the
floods
were
out
the
silent
water
and
the
darkness
spread
away
on
their
left
almost
afraid
they
hurried
along
by
the
houses
supper
was
laid
he
swung
the
curtain
over
the
window
there
was
a
bowl
of
freesias
and
scarlet
anemones
on
the
table
she
bent
to
them
still
touching
them
with
her
she
looked
up
at
him
saying
are
they
beautiful
yes
he
said
what
will
you
drink
coffee
i
should
like
it
she
said
then
excuse
me
a
he
went
out
to
the
kitchen
miriam
took
off
her
things
and
looked
round
it
was
a
bare
severe
room
her
photo
clara
annie
were
on
the
wall
she
looked
on
the
to
see
what
he
was
doing
there
were
only
a
few
meaningless
lines
she
looked
to
see
what
books
he
was
reading
evidently
just
an
ordinary
novel
the
letters
in
the
rack
she
saw
were
from
annie
arthur
and
from
some
man
or
other
she
did
not
know
everything
he
had
touched
everything
that
was
in
the
least
personal
to
him
she
examined
with
lingering
absorption
he
had
been
gone
from
her
for
so
long
she
wanted
to
rediscover
him
his
position
what
he
was
now
but
there
was
not
much
in
the
room
to
help
her
it
only
made
her
feel
rather
sad
it
was
so
hard
and
comfortless
she
was
curiously
examining
a
when
he
returned
with
the
coffee
there
nothing
new
in
it
he
said
and
nothing
very
he
put
down
the
tray
and
went
to
look
over
her
shoulder
she
turned
the
pages
slowly
intent
on
examining
everything
h
he
said
as
she
paused
at
a
sketch
i
forgotten
that
it
not
bad
is
it
no
she
said
i
do
quite
understand
he
took
the
book
from
her
and
went
through
it
again
he
made
a
curious
sound
of
surprise
and
pleasure
there
some
not
bad
stuff
in
there
he
said
not
at
all
bad
she
answered
gravely
he
felt
again
her
interest
in
his
work
or
was
it
for
himself
why
was
she
always
most
interested
in
him
as
he
appeared
in
his
work
they
sat
down
to
supper
by
the
way
he
said
did
i
hear
something
about
your
earning
your
own
living
yes
she
replied
bowing
her
dark
head
over
her
cup
and
what
of
it
i
merely
going
to
the
farming
college
at
broughton
for
three
months
and
i
shall
probably
be
kept
on
as
a
teacher
i
say
that
sounds
all
right
for
you
you
always
wanted
to
be
yes
why
did
you
tell
me
i
only
knew
last
but
i
heard
a
month
ago
he
said
yes
but
nothing
was
settled
i
should
have
thought
he
said
you
have
told
me
you
were
she
ate
her
food
in
the
deliberate
constrained
way
almost
as
if
she
recoiled
a
little
from
doing
anything
so
publicly
that
he
knew
so
well
i
suppose
you
glad
he
said
very
yes
it
will
be
he
was
rather
disappointed
i
think
it
will
be
a
great
deal
she
said
almost
haughtily
resentfully
he
laughed
shortly
why
do
you
think
it
wo
she
asked
oh
i
do
think
it
wo
be
a
great
deal
only
you
find
earning
your
own
living
is
no
she
said
swallowing
with
difficulty
i
do
suppose
it
i
suppose
work
can
be
nearly
everything
to
a
man
he
said
though
it
is
to
me
but
a
woman
only
works
with
a
part
of
herself
the
real
and
vital
part
is
covered
but
a
man
can
give
all
himself
to
work
she
asked
yes
and
a
woman
only
the
unimportant
part
of
herself
that
she
looked
up
at
him
and
her
eyes
dilated
with
anger
then
she
said
if
it
true
it
a
great
it
is
but
i
do
know
everything
he
answered
after
supper
they
drew
up
to
the
fire
he
swung
her
a
chair
facing
him
and
they
sat
down
she
was
wearing
a
dress
of
dark
claret
colour
that
suited
her
dark
complexion
and
her
large
features
still
the
curls
were
fine
and
free
but
her
face
was
much
older
the
brown
throat
much
thinner
she
seemed
old
to
him
older
than
clara
her
bloom
of
youth
had
quickly
gone
a
sort
of
stiffness
almost
of
woodenness
had
come
upon
her
she
meditated
a
little
while
then
looked
at
him
and
how
are
things
with
you
she
asked
about
all
right
he
answered
she
looked
at
him
waiting
nay
she
said
very
low
her
brown
nervous
hands
were
clasped
over
her
knee
they
had
still
the
lack
of
confidence
or
repose
the
almost
hysterical
look
he
winced
as
he
saw
them
then
he
laughed
mirthlessly
she
put
her
fingers
between
her
lips
his
slim
black
tortured
body
lay
quite
still
in
the
chair
she
suddenly
took
her
finger
from
her
mouth
and
looked
at
him
and
you
have
broken
off
with
clara
his
body
lay
like
an
abandoned
thing
strewn
in
the
chair
you
know
she
said
i
think
we
ought
to
be
he
opened
his
eyes
for
the
first
time
since
many
months
and
attended
to
her
with
respect
why
he
said
see
she
said
how
you
waste
yourself
you
might
be
ill
you
might
die
and
i
never
know
be
no
more
then
than
if
i
had
never
known
and
if
we
married
he
asked
at
any
rate
i
could
prevent
you
wasting
yourself
and
being
a
prey
to
other
women
like
like
a
prey
he
repeated
smiling
she
bowed
her
head
in
silence
he
lay
feeling
his
despair
come
up
again
i
not
sure
he
said
slowly
that
marriage
would
be
much
i
only
think
of
you
she
replied
i
know
you
do
but
you
love
me
so
much
you
want
to
put
me
in
your
pocket
and
i
should
die
there
she
bent
her
head
put
her
fingers
between
her
lips
while
the
bitterness
surged
up
in
her
heart
and
what
will
you
do
otherwise
she
asked
i
do
know
go
on
i
suppose
perhaps
i
shall
soon
go
the
despairing
doggedness
in
his
tone
made
her
go
on
her
knees
on
the
rug
before
the
fire
very
near
to
him
there
she
crouched
as
if
she
were
crushed
by
something
and
could
not
raise
her
head
his
hands
lay
quite
inert
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
she
was
aware
of
them
she
felt
that
now
he
lay
at
her
mercy
if
she
could
rise
take
him
put
her
arms
round
him
and
say
you
are
mine
then
he
would
leave
himself
to
her
but
dare
she
she
could
easily
sacrifice
herself
but
dare
she
assert
herself
she
was
aware
of
his
slender
body
that
seemed
one
stroke
of
life
sprawled
in
the
chair
close
to
her
but
no
she
dared
not
put
her
arms
round
it
take
it
up
and
say
it
is
mine
this
body
leave
it
to
and
she
wanted
to
it
called
to
all
her
instinct
but
she
crouched
and
dared
not
she
was
afraid
he
would
not
let
her
she
was
afraid
it
was
too
much
it
lay
there
his
body
abandoned
she
knew
she
ought
to
take
it
up
and
claim
it
and
claim
every
right
to
it
but
could
she
do
it
her
impotence
before
him
before
the
strong
demand
of
some
unknown
thing
in
him
was
her
extremity
her
hands
fluttered
she
her
head
her
eyes
shuddering
appealing
gone
almost
distracted
pleaded
to
him
suddenly
his
heart
caught
with
pity
he
took
her
hands
drew
her
to
him
and
comforted
her
will
you
have
me
to
marry
me
he
said
very
low
oh
why
did
not
he
take
her
her
very
soul
belonged
to
him
why
would
he
not
take
what
was
his
she
had
borne
so
long
the
cruelty
of
belonging
to
him
and
not
being
claimed
by
him
now
he
was
straining
her
again
it
was
too
much
for
her
she
drew
back
her
head
held
his
face
between
her
hands
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
no
he
was
hard
he
wanted
something
else
she
pleaded
to
him
with
all
her
love
not
to
make
it
her
choice
she
could
not
cope
with
it
with
him
she
knew
not
with
what
but
it
strained
her
till
she
felt
she
would
break
do
you
want
it
she
asked
very
gravely
not
much
he
replied
with
pain
she
turned
her
face
aside
then
raising
herself
with
dignity
she
took
his
head
to
her
bosom
and
rocked
him
softly
she
was
not
to
have
him
then
so
she
could
comfort
him
she
put
her
fingers
through
his
hair
for
her
the
anguished
sweetness
of
for
him
the
hate
and
misery
of
another
failure
he
could
not
bear
it
that
breast
which
was
warm
and
which
cradled
him
without
taking
the
burden
of
him
so
much
he
wanted
to
rest
on
her
that
the
feint
of
rest
only
tortured
him
he
drew
away
and
without
marriage
we
can
do
nothing
he
asked
his
mouth
was
lifted
from
his
teeth
with
pain
she
put
her
little
finger
between
her
lips
no
she
said
low
and
like
the
toll
of
a
bell
no
i
think
it
was
the
end
then
between
them
she
could
not
take
him
and
relieve
him
of
the
responsibility
of
himself
she
could
only
sacrifice
herself
to
him
sacrifice
herself
every
day
gladly
and
that
he
did
not
want
he
wanted
her
to
hold
him
and
say
with
joy
and
authority
stop
all
this
restlessness
and
beating
against
death
you
are
mine
for
a
she
had
not
the
strength
or
was
it
a
mate
she
wanted
or
did
she
want
a
christ
in
him
he
felt
in
leaving
her
he
was
defrauding
her
of
life
but
he
knew
that
in
staying
stilling
the
inner
desperate
man
he
was
denying
his
own
life
and
he
did
not
hope
to
give
life
to
her
by
denying
his
own
she
sat
very
quiet
he
lit
a
cigarette
the
smoke
went
up
from
it
wavering
he
was
thinking
of
his
mother
and
had
forgotten
miriam
she
suddenly
looked
at
him
her
bitterness
came
surging
up
her
sacrifice
then
was
useless
he
lay
there
aloof
careless
about
her
suddenly
she
saw
again
his
lack
of
religion
his
restless
instability
he
would
destroy
himself
like
a
perverse
child
well
then
he
would
i
think
i
must
go
she
said
softly
by
her
tone
he
knew
she
was
despising
him
he
rose
quietly
i
come
along
with
you
he
answered
she
stood
before
the
mirror
pinning
on
her
hat
how
bitter
how
unutterably
bitter
it
made
her
that
he
rejected
her
sacrifice
life
ahead
looked
dead
as
if
the
glow
were
gone
out
she
bowed
her
face
over
the
flowers
the
freesias
so
sweet
and
the
scarlet
anemones
flaunting
over
the
table
it
was
like
him
to
have
those
flowers
he
moved
about
the
room
with
a
certain
sureness
of
touch
swift
and
relentless
and
quiet
she
knew
she
could
not
cope
with
him
he
would
escape
like
a
weasel
out
of
her
hands
yet
without
him
her
life
would
trail
on
lifeless
brooding
she
touched
the
flowers
have
them
he
said
and
he
took
them
out
of
the
jar
dripping
as
they
were
and
went
quickly
into
the
kitchen
she
waited
for
him
took
the
flowers
and
they
went
out
together
he
talking
she
feeling
dead
she
was
going
from
him
now
in
her
misery
she
leaned
against
him
as
they
sat
on
the
car
he
was
unresponsive
where
would
he
go
what
would
be
the
end
of
him
she
could
not
bear
it
the
vacant
feeling
where
he
should
be
he
was
so
foolish
so
wasteful
never
at
peace
with
himself
and
now
where
would
he
go
and
what
did
he
care
that
he
wasted
her
he
had
no
religion
it
was
all
for
the
moment
attraction
that
he
cared
nothing
else
nothing
deeper
well
she
would
wait
and
see
how
it
turned
out
with
him
when
he
had
had
enough
he
would
give
in
and
come
to
her
he
shook
hands
and
left
her
at
the
door
of
her
cousin
house
when
he
turned
away
he
felt
the
last
hold
for
him
had
gone
the
town
as
he
sat
upon
the
car
stretched
away
over
the
bay
of
railway
a
level
fume
of
lights
beyond
the
town
the
country
little
smouldering
spots
for
more
towns
the
sea
the
night
on
and
on
and
he
had
no
place
in
it
whatever
spot
he
stood
on
there
he
stood
alone
from
his
breast
from
his
mouth
sprang
the
endless
space
and
it
was
there
behind
him
everywhere
the
people
hurrying
along
the
streets
offered
no
obstruction
to
the
void
in
which
he
found
himself
they
were
small
shadows
whose
footsteps
and
voices
could
be
heard
but
in
each
of
them
the
same
night
the
same
silence
he
got
off
the
car
in
the
country
all
was
dead
still
little
stars
shone
high
up
little
stars
spread
far
away
in
the
a
firmament
below
everywhere
the
vastness
and
terror
of
the
immense
night
which
is
roused
and
stirred
for
a
brief
while
by
the
day
but
which
returns
and
will
remain
at
last
eternal
holding
everything
in
its
silence
and
its
living
gloom
there
was
no
time
only
space
who
could
say
his
mother
had
lived
and
did
not
live
she
had
been
in
one
place
and
was
in
another
that
was
all
and
his
soul
could
not
leave
her
wherever
she
was
now
she
was
gone
abroad
into
the
night
and
he
was
with
her
still
they
were
together
but
yet
there
was
his
body
his
chest
that
leaned
against
the
stile
his
hands
on
the
wooden
bar
they
seemed
something
where
was
he
one
tiny
upright
speck
of
flesh
less
than
an
ear
of
wheat
lost
in
the
field
he
could
not
bear
it
on
every
side
the
immense
dark
silence
seemed
pressing
him
so
tiny
a
spark
into
extinction
and
yet
almost
nothing
he
could
not
be
extinct
night
in
which
everything
was
lost
went
reaching
out
beyond
stars
and
sun
stars
and
sun
a
few
bright
grains
went
spinning
round
for
terror
and
holding
each
other
in
embrace
there
in
a
darkness
that
outpassed
them
all
and
left
them
tiny
and
daunted
so
much
and
himself
infinitesimal
at
the
core
a
nothingness
and
yet
not
nothing
mother
he
whispered
mother
she
was
the
only
thing
that
held
him
up
himself
amid
all
this
and
she
was
gone
intermingled
herself
he
wanted
her
to
touch
him
have
him
alongside
with
her
but
no
he
would
not
give
in
turning
sharply
he
walked
towards
the
city
gold
phosphorescence
his
fists
were
shut
his
mouth
set
fast
he
would
not
take
that
direction
to
the
darkness
to
follow
her
he
walked
towards
the
faintly
humming
glowing
town
quickly
the
end
