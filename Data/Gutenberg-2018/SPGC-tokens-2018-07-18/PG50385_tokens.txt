at

let

gossip
in

lady
wanley
nonsense
i
didn
t
come
to
the
grand
babylon
in
order
to
blush
unseen
i
caught
sight
of
a
number
of
people
during
luncheon
who
i
m
quite
determined
shall
catch
sight
of
me
now
holland
i
was
sufficiently
gallant
to
have
eyes
for
you
only
lady
wanley
to
a
shall
we
sit
there
holland
d
you
mind
sitting
on
the
other
side
the
waiter
s
rather
a
pal
of
mine
lady
wanley
what
queer
friends
you
have
holland
waiter
a
waiter
your
waiter
will
be
here
in
one
minute
sir
holland
lady
wanley
you
see
i
ve
knocked
about
in
so
many
places
that
i
have
friends
in
every
city
in
the
world
and
every
rank
in
life
lady
wanley
i
suppose
you
saw
the
they
were
sitting
three
tables
from
us
holland
i
did
lady
wanley
do
you
know
that
she
cut
me
dead
when
i
came
in
holland
i
ve
long
told
you
that
is
growing
exclusive
lady
wanley
but
my
dear
ambrose
that
she
should
have
the
impudence
to
cut
me
holland
i
respect
her
for
it
lady
wanley
i
m
much
obliged
to
you
holland
i
don
t
think
it
does
much
credit
to
her
heart
but
it
certainly
does
to
her
understanding
she
has
discovered
that
a
title
nowadays
is
not
nearly
such
a
good
passport
to
the
world
of
fashion
as
she
thought
it
was
she
knows
you
re
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
and
she
s
realised
that
in
society
the
poor
are
quite
rightly
hated
and
despised
by
all
who
know
them
lady
wanley
yes
but
remember
the
circumstances
five
years
ago
the
didn
t
know
a
soul
in
the
world
they
d
lived
in
brixton
all
their
lives
holland
it
has
been
whispered
to
me
that
in
those
days
they
were
known
as
and
bob
jennings
not
nearly
so
smart
is
it
lady
wanley
he
used
to
go
to
the
city
every
morning
with
a
black
bag
in
one
hand
and
an
umbrella
in
the
other
holland
i
wish
that
confounded
waiter
would
come
lady
wanley
one
day
an
uncle
in
the
north
from
whom
they
vaguely
had
expectations
died
suddenly
and
left
them
nearly
two
millions
holland
some
people
are
so
lucky
in
the
way
they
choose
their
uncles
lady
wanley
he
was
a
hardware
manufacturer
and
no
one
dreamt
that
he
had
a
tenth
part
of
that
fortune
i
came
across
them
in
switzerland
and
found
they
were
looking
for
a
house
holland
so
with
a
burst
of
hospitality
you
asked
them
down
to
taverner
and
they
took
it
for
years
lady
wanley
i
introduced
them
to
every
one
in
the
county
i
gave
little
parties
so
that
they
might
meet
people
and
now
if
you
please
the
woman
cuts
me
holland
you
have
left
out
an
essential
detail
in
the
account
of
your
relations
with
these
good
folk
lady
wanley
have
i
holland
you
have
omitted
to
mention
that
when
they
took
taverner
they
agreed
to
pay
an
exorbitant
rent
lady
wanley
they
could
well
afford
it
besides
it
was
a
historic
place
it
was
worth
whatever
i
could
get
for
it
holland
may
be
very
vulgar
but
he
s
as
shrewd
a
man
as
you
d
find
anywhere
between
park
lane
and
jerusalem
lady
wanley
i
haven
t
the
least
idea
what
you
re
talking
about
holland
haven
t
you
well
then
i
venture
to
suggest
that
if
gave
you
such
an
enormous
rent
for
taverner
it
was
on
a
certain
understanding
he
was
wise
enough
to
find
out
that
people
can
live
in
cheshire
all
their
lives
and
never
know
a
soul
i
don
t
suppose
he
put
it
in
the
agreement
between
you
but
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
he
took
your
place
only
on
the
condition
that
you
should
get
every
one
to
call
lady
wanley
a
brief
i
was
crippled
with
mortgages
and
i
had
to
send
my
boys
to
eton
holland
good
heavens
i
m
not
blaming
you
i
only
wish
to
point
out
that
if
you
introduced
jennings
to
your
friends
it
was
a
matter
of
business
rather
than
of
sentiment
lady
wanley
a
little
i
suppose
you
think
it
s
very
natural
that
she
should
wish
to
kick
away
the
ladder
by
which
she
climbed
waiter
up
holland
waiter
jack
straw
yes
sir
holland
two
coffees
and
two
benedictines
but
you
re
not
my
usual
waiter
where
s
pierre
waiter
he
s
attending
the
funeral
of
an
elderly
female
relative
sir
holland
up
quickly
and
then
stares
in
a
puzzled
holland
i
seem
to
know
your
face
have
i
seen
you
anywhere
waiter
a
ambrose
holland
i
think
holland
jack
straw
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
jack
straw
my
dear
fellow
it
is
possible
to
be
no
less
of
a
philosopher
in
the
uniform
of
a
waiter
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
than
in
the
gown
of
a
professor
at
the
university
of
oxford
goes
lady
wanley
it
s
really
very
odd
that
waiters
should
address
you
as
my
dear
fellow
holland
what
an
extraordinary
encounter
lady
wanley
please
tell
me
who
your
friend
is
holland
i
haven
t
the
ghost
of
an
idea
lady
wanley
my
dear
ambrose
holland
i
first
met
him
in
the
states
i
was
in
considerable
financial
difficulties
in
those
days
it
s
three
or
four
years
ago
now
and
i
got
a
small
part
in
a
travelling
company
jack
straw
was
a
member
of
it
and
we
became
great
friends
lady
wanley
is
that
his
name
holland
so
he
assures
me
lady
wanley
it
s
very
improbable
isn
t
it
holland
very
i
believe
jack
straw
was
a
highwayman
or
something
like
that
and
he
s
given
his
name
to
a
in
hampstead
lady
wanley
he
must
be
an
extraordinary
man
holland
he
is
i
don
t
know
whether
i
admire
most
his
or
his
resourcefulness
i
spent
with
him
the
last
two
years
before
my
ship
came
home
we
had
some
pretty
rough
times
together
but
he
was
a
pillar
of
strength
difficulties
seemed
to
arise
only
that
he
might
surmount
them
lady
wanley
he
sounds
quite
splendid
holland
the
worst
of
living
with
him
was
that
you
had
no
he
s
a
man
with
an
uncontrollable
love
of
adventure
prosperity
bores
him
to
death
and
time
after
time
when
we
d
managed
to
get
out
of
rough
water
into
smooth
he
d
throw
up
everything
for
some
wild
goose
chase
lady
wanley
but
who
are
his
people
holland
heaven
only
knows
i
know
he
isn
t
english
though
he
speaks
it
wonderfully
lady
wanley
is
he
by
way
of
being
a
gentleman
holland
i
can
only
tell
you
that
he
s
thoroughly
at
home
in
whatever
society
he
finds
himself
lady
wanley
i
daresay
that
s
not
a
bad
definition
of
a
gentleman
holland
he
s
sailed
before
the
mast
been
a
in
new
york
and
an
on
the
canadian
pacific
he
s
been
a
miner
up
in
the
klondyke
and
he
s
worked
on
a
ranch
in
texas
and
if
he
s
a
waiter
now
i
daresay
he
ll
be
an
next
week
and
a
the
week
after
i
ve
seen
half
a
dozen
fortunes
within
his
grasp
and
he
s
let
them
all
slip
through
his
fingers
from
sheer
indifference
to
money
lady
wanley
here
he
is
with
the
coffee
jack
straw
in
with
coffee
and
holland
i
should
be
overwhelmed
with
confusion
at
allowing
you
to
wait
on
me
if
i
did
not
feel
certain
that
it
appeals
enormously
to
your
sense
of
humour
jack
straw
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
you
will
feel
a
natural
hesitation
about
giving
me
a
tip
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
i
shall
feel
none
about
taking
it
holland
it
s
thoughtful
of
you
to
warn
me
how
much
do
i
owe
you
jack
straw
two
shillings
the
coffee
and
three
shillings
the
liqueur
the
prices
seem
exorbitant
to
me
but
i
suppose
people
must
expect
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
letting
their
friends
see
them
at
the
best
hotel
in
europe
holland
down
a
don
t
bother
about
the
change
jack
straw
half
a
sovereign
my
dear
fellow
when
you
offer
me
a
tip
of
five
shillings
you
are
presuming
unwarrantably
on
our
former
acquaintance
holland
i
m
sure
i
beg
your
pardon
jack
straw
i
will
keep
one
shilling
as
an
adequate
remuneration
for
my
services
and
return
you
four
holland
i
am
overpowered
by
your
condescension
jack
straw
lady
wanley
has
put
a
cigarette
in
her
light
madam
holland
i
should
like
to
ask
you
to
sit
down
jack
straw
it
would
be
eminently
improper
besides
i
have
other
tables
to
attend
to
but
i
shall
be
delighted
to
dine
with
you
if
you
have
no
other
engagement
holland
it
s
very
kind
of
you
but
will
not
your
duties
here
detain
you
mr
straw
lady
wanley
jack
straw
how
do
you
do
i
m
only
engaged
here
for
the
afternoon
your
ladyship
is
aware
that
the
lower
orders
make
a
speciality
in
the
decease
of
elderly
female
relatives
lady
wanley
i
have
often
been
impressed
by
the
piety
with
which
they
bury
their
maternal
grandmothers
jack
straw
it
appears
that
pierre
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
wished
to
attend
the
funeral
of
a
widowed
aunt
the
relic
of
an
egg
importer
in
soho
and
a
highly
respectable
person
lady
wanley
i
can
well
imagine
that
nothing
could
be
more
respectable
than
to
import
eggs
to
soho
jack
straw
the
who
is
an
excellent
fellow
with
female
relatives
of
his
own
promised
to
overlook
his
absence
if
he
could
find
a
substitute
pierre
like
myself
is
a
person
of
somewhat
striking
physique
and
could
find
no
one
able
to
wear
his
clothes
he
confided
his
distress
to
me
and
i
knowing
that
his
uniform
would
fit
me
like
a
glove
offered
at
once
to
step
into
the
breach
holland
i
am
relieved
to
hear
that
your
appearance
in
this
capacity
is
not
due
to
embarrassed
circumstances
jack
straw
i
deplore
the
hastiness
of
your
reasoning
my
circumstances
are
excessively
embarrassed

me

proposing

absurd

a
modern
nice

of
saint

course
he
couldn
t

the
archduke

suddenly
disappeared
four
years
ago
now
isn
t
it
and
hasn
t
been
heard
of
since
he
simply
vanished
into
thin
air
lady

alive

von
bremer
the
story
is
rather
entertaining
there
s
an
american
woman
here
who
has
a
passion
for
titles
and
it
occurred
to
my
one
day
to
introduce
his
valet
to
her
as
count
of
course
she
was
full
of
attentions
and
immediately
asked
the
valet
to
dinner
presently
the
story
came
to
my
ears
i
really
couldn
t
have
my
playing
practical
jokes
of
that
sort
and
so
i
sent
him

jennings

give

not
to
have
insulted
that
poor
child
i
m
going
to
give
her
a
lesson
that
she
ll
never

holland
she

pretty
well
anything
that
your
feminine
spite
can
suggest
lady
wanley
i
can
do
nothing
without
you
ambrose
holland
don
t
ask

anything
very
disreputable
lady

got
her
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
ambrose
holland
well
lady
wanley
don
t
you

that
story
adrian
von

let

try
it
on
jennings
holland
but
lady
wanley
oh
don
t
make
any
objections
you
remember
he
introduced
his
valet
to
a
woman
as
a
foreign
nobleman
of
sorts
holland
i
m
bound
to
say
i
thought
it
a
very
silly
trick
lady
wanley
i
have
no
patience
with
you
think
how
exactly
the
punishment
fits
the
crime
what
a
triumph
it
would
be
if
we
got
to
take
to
her
bosom
holland
who
lady
wanley
your
friend
the
waiter
i
m
sure
he
ll
do
it
if
you
ask
him
he
ll
look
upon
it
as
an
adventure
holland
i
don
t
think
he
d
do
it
he
s
an
odd
fellow
lady
wanley
oh
but
ask
him
there
can
be
no
harm
in
that
holland
it
s
all
very
well
but
one
has
to
consider
the
possible
complications
lady
wanley
there
can
t
be
any
complications
we
only
want
to
punish
an
insolent
snob
who
s
wantonly
insulted
a
woman
who
never
hurt
a
fly
in
her
life
jack
straw
up
to
their
jack
straw
have
you
done
with

can
do
it
with
clean
hands
lady
wanley
dear
me
jack
straw

your
ladyship
thinks
it
odd
that
a
waiter
should
have
susceptibilities
holland
let
me
tell
you
at
once
that
i
highly
disapprove
of
lady
wanley

idea

in
your
country
jack
straw
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
the
order
of
the
boot
vincent
i
can
t
think
why
they
don
t
have
english
waiters
in
a
smart
hotel
like
this
instead
of
these
damned
foreigners
now
then
look
slippy
jack
straw
fixed
his
eyes
ethel
has
been
looking
down
she
gives
him
a
glance
he
takes
the
coffee
things
and
gives
them
to
another
ethel
voice
trembling
with
how
can
you
talk
like
that
to
a
man
who
can
t
defend
himself
it
s
so
cowardly
to
insult
a
servant
who
daren
t
answer
vincent
i
should
think
not
indeed
i
should
like
to
see
any
servant
answer
me
you
never
ave
learnt
ow
to
treat
servants
ethel
you
always
talk
to
them
as
if
they
was
one
of
ourselves
i
wish
you
could
take
a
leaf
out
of
vincent
s
book
treat
em
like
dirt
and
they
ll
respect
you
jack
straw
given
instructions
to
the
waiter
goes
holland
lady
wanley
jack
straw
i
m
willing
to
do
what
you
asked
me
to
holland
why
have
you
changed
your
mind
jack
straw
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
m
perfectly
indifferent
to
the
rudeness
and
the
vulgarity
of
your
friends
but
i
think
i
should
like
to
know
that
young
lady
holland
would
you
by
jove
jack
straw
when
her
father
insulted
me
the
most
ravishing
colour
came
into
her
pale
cheeks
and
she
looked
at
me
with
the
most
beautiful
eyes
in
the
world
and
they
were
veiled
with
tears
lady
wanley
and
is
that
enough
to
make
you
change
your
mind
holland
fortunately
mr
straw
is
not
in
the
habit
of
falling
in
love
or
i
should
refuse
to
hear
anything
more
of
this
scheme
lady
wanley
when
will
you
be
ready
jack
straw
i
m
ready
now
it
s
three
o
clock
and
pierre
is
waiting
in
the
basement
to
put
on
this
uniform
lady
wanley
we
couldn
t
find
a
better
place
than
this
to
effect
an
introduction
jack
straw
give
me
two
minutes
to
change
my
clothes
and
i
am
at
your
service
lady
wanley
you
have
indeed
an
adventurous
spirit
jack
straw
but
i
must
make
one
condition
two
in
fact
lady
wanley
what
are
they
jack
straw
well
although
you
have
glided
over
the
point
with
singular
discretion
it
is
plain
that
you
do
not
want
me
to
assume
a
certain
character
merely
in
order
to
enjoy
a
private
snigger
at
the
expense
of
these
amiable
people
lady
wanley
i
don
t
think
i
know
what
you
mean
jack
straw
madam
it
is
always
dangerous
to
count
too
much
on
the
stupidity
of
one
s
fellows
we
shall
arrange
this
matter
much
better
if
you
realise
that
i
m
a
person
of
some
shrewdness
holland
go
on
jack
straw
it
is
evident
that
you
wish
these
good
folk
to
take
me
to
their
bosom
in
order
that
you
may
have
the
opportunity
of
telling
them
one
day
that
i
m
merely
an
impostor
lady
wanley
i
really
hadn
t
thought
about
that
jack
straw
i
venture
to
suspect
that
you
rate
your
intelligence
too
low
lady
wanley
well
what
is
your
condition
jack
straw
the
position
will
be
very
humiliating
to
me
for
all
i
know
it
may
bring
me
into
uncomfortable
relations
with
the
police
holland
i
think
the
whole
plan
had
better
be
dropped
it
will
lead
to
endless
bother
jack
straw
i
have
no
wish
to
drop
it
you
want
to
revenge
yourself
on
some
people
who
have
insulted
you
i
for
reasons
of
my
own
am
willing
to
help
but
i
make
the
condition
that
you
do
not
disclose
the
truth
till
i
give
you
leave
i
promise
not
to
withhold
it
unreasonably
lady
wanley
i
accept
that
and
the
second
condition
jack
straw
is
very
easy
i
insist
that
you
should
behave
towards
me
whether
we
re
alone
or
in
public
as
you
naturally
would
if
i
were
really
the
individual
i
propose
to
personate
lady
wanley
that
s
only
fair
now
who
can
we
suggest
that
you
should
be
holland
you
d
better
try
and
invent
some
character
who
you
re
quite
sure
doesn
t
exist
lady
wanley
we
want
something
very
extravagant
and
jack
straw
pray
do
not
put
yourselves
to
the
trouble
of
thinking
you
will
introduce
me
to
your
friends
as
the
archduke
sebastian
of
pomerania
holland
what
lady
wanley
but
that
s
a
real
person
jack
straw
to
invent
an
imaginary
one
would
be
ridiculous
your
friends
would
only
need
to
look
in
the
almanack
de
gotha
to
discover
the
fraud
lady
wanley
but
count
von
bremer
was
talking
to
us
about
him
just
now
the
archduke
sebastian
is
the
man
who
mysteriously
disappeared
jack
straw
it
s
because
his
whereabouts
are
unknown
that
he
s
the
safest
person
to
choose
holland
you
would
never
be
able
to
pass
yourself
off
for
an
archduke
jack
straw
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
you
a
royal
prince
eats
drinks
breathes
and
behaves
generally
very
much
like
men
of
baser
clay
lady
wanley
you
d
be
found
out
in
a
week
jack
straw
but
how
do
you
know
i
m
not
the
archduke
sebastian
holland
a
scornful
you
look
it
lady
wanley
but
you
d
want
a
suite
and
all
sorts
of
things
jack
straw
the
man
is
notoriously
eccentric
i
think
it
very
likely
that
the
company
of
a
stuffy
old
colonel
of
dragoons
would
bore
him
to
death
holland
it
s
preposterous
jack
straw
you
may
either
take
it
or
leave
it
i
will
be
the
archduke
sebastian
or
nobody
lady
wanley
after
all
jennings
will
probably
never
have
heard
of
this
trumpery
archduke
jack
straw
and
if
she
has
what
more
probable
than
that
having
had
enough
of
retirement
he
should
enter
once
more
upon
the
position
which
is
his
by
rights
lady
wanley
holland
it
makes
the
joke
infinitely
better
jack
straw
you
must
make
up
your
minds
at
once
lady
wanley
ambrose

toss

ethel
lord
serlo
serlo
half
a
mo
i
ain
t
done
yet
eminently
suitable
match
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
only
the
young
lady
couldn
t
stick
me
at
any
price
ethel
i
don
t
know
why
you
should
say
this
serlo
better
have
it
out
you
know
rotten
keepin
things
on
your
chest
don
t
blame
the
young
lady
don
t
know
that
i
should
much
fancy
myself
if
i
was
a
blushing
damsel
not
everybody
s
money
got
a
bit
damaged
in
transit
eh
what
been
mixed
up
in
one
or
two
scandals
not
the
right
thing
for
an
marquess
bit
inclined
to
drink
no
harm
in
him
you
know
but
not
the
sort
of
man
you
d
like
to
spend
the
rest
of
your
life
with
young
woman
got
a
mind
of
her
own
lets
the
noble
lord
see
she
wouldn
t
take
him
if
he
was
given
away
with
a
pound
of
tea
all
right
says
noble
lord
bet
s
off
not
much
says
mother
of
young
woman
half
a
million
goin
beggin
give
her
time
to
get
used
to
you
fascinating
cove
really
more
she
knows
you
more
she
ll
like
you
come
down
and
stay
in
the
country
ethel
a
how
can
you
talk
such
nonsense
serlo
all
right
says
noble
lord
i
m
on
jolly
nice
girl
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
noble
lord
rather
smit
thinks
if
she
ll
have
him
he
ll
turn
over
a
new
leaf
give
up
everythin
rotten
and
try
and
make
her
a
good
husband
rather
taken
with
the
idea
of
double
harness
he
may
look
a
fool
but
noble
lord
knows
a
good
thing
when
he
sees
it
and
the
young
lady
s
about
the
best
thing
he
s
ever
set
eyes
on
ethel
are
you
talking
seriously
by
any
chance
serlo
now
don
t
interrupt
me
i
ve
just
got
into
a
good
steady
canter
and
i
ll
get
it
all
off
my
chest
at
once
ethel
i
m
so
sorry
serlo
well
when
eligible
marquess
gets
down
in
the
country
what
d
you
think
he
finds
blessed
if
there
ain
t
a
foreign
prince
on
the
scene
my
word
that
s
enough
to
put
the
noble
lord
s
aristocratic
nose
right
out
of
joint
ain
t
it
look
here
old
boy
you
keep
your
weather
eye
open
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
says
the
noble
lord
to
himself
may
be
an
ass
don
t
you
know
but
when
there
s
a
bloomin
hurricane
comin
along
he
can
see
which
way
the
wind
is
blowin
brother
rather
chilly
father
rather
chilly
mother
regular
iceberg
all
right
says
noble
lord
to
himself
but
what
about
pretty
polly
ethel
is
that
me
by
any
chance
serlo
for
the
last
month
pretty
polly
had
been
simply
turnin
her
back
on
noble
lord
snubbin
him
right
and
left
and
all
of
a
sudden
she
becomes
extraordinary
affable
hulloa
what
s
this
says
noble
lord
and
his
little
heart
goes
he
may
be
a
fool
but
he
ain
t
a
damned
fool
and
in
a
day
or
two
he
tumbles
to
it
so
like
a
wise
man
he
packs
his
bag
and
hooks
it
ethel
i
don
t
know
what
on
earth
you
mean
serlo
don
t
you
well
will
you
have
it
straight
from
the
shoulder
ethel
we
agreed
to
be
quite
frank
serlo
all
right
no
spoof
my
dear
i
just
saw
that
you
were
fairly
knocked
silly
by
the
archduke
and
there
wasn
t
a
ghost
of
a
chance
for
little
ned
serlo
ethel
it
s
not
true
serlo
oh
yes
it
is
you
see
i
m
a
bit
knocked
silly
myself
and
that
makes
you
precious
ethel
you
serlo
all
right
you
needn
t
get
up
on
your
hind
legs
i
m
not
goin
to
propose
to
you
now
i
know
it
would
be
no
precious
good
at
first
i
didn
t
care
twopence
it
was
just
a
business
arrangement
half
a
million
down
on
one
side
and
an
marquisate
on
the
other
but
now
well
you
know
i
m
rather
an
ass
at
saying
what
i
mean
when
i
really
mean
it
ethel
i
m
very
sorry
i
m
afraid
i
ve
been
unkind
to
you
serlo
oh
no
you
haven
t
i
do
seem
a
rotten
little
bounder
don
t
i
ethel
no
i
think
you
might
be
an
awfully
good
friend
serlo
it
s
jolly
of
you
to
say
so
you
know
i
can
t
stick
your
family
can
you
ethel
you
see
i
knew
them
before
they
were
rich
when
you
ve
lived
all
your
life
in
a
sordid
narrow
way
it
s
very
hard
to
have
such
enormous
wealth
as
ours
serlo
you
make
allowances
for
them
but
you
never
did
for
me
ethel
it
would
have
been
very
impertinent
of
me
serlo
it
never
struck
you
that
it
s
devilish
hard
to
be
a
marquess
with
no
means
of
livelihood
but
your
title
and
the
worst
of
a
title
is
that
it
ll
get
you
plenty
of
credit
but
dooced
little
hard
cash
ethel
i
never
thought
of
that
serlo
well
look
here
what
i
wanted
to
say
is
this
it
s
no
business
of
mine
about
the
archduke
you
know
i
don
t
know
much
about
royalty
but
i
don
t
think
a
foreign
prince
is
likely
to
marry
the
daughter
of
nobody
in
particular
just
because
she
s
got
nice
eyes
and
a
pot
of
money
ethel
about
to
no
let
me
go
on
you
may
be
going
to
have
a
rotten
time
and
i
just
want
you
to
know
that
if
at
any
time
you
want
me
well
you
know
what
i
mean
don
t
you
let
s
forget
that
you
re
an
heiress
and
i
m
an
marquess
you
re
an
awfully
ripping
sort
and
i
m
just
ned
serlo
i
m
not
a
bad
sort
either
and
perhaps
we
might
be
happy
together
ethel
it
s
very
charming
of
you
i
m
so
glad
that
i
know
you
better
now
whatever
happens
i
know
i
can
count
on
you
serlo
that
s
all
right
then
meanwhile
noble
lord
s
goin
to
hook
it
leave
the
coast
clear
and
bear
it
like
a
man
don
t
you
know
jack
straw
jack
straw
well
how
are
the
weather
and
the
crops
serlo
blessed
if
i
know
sir
jack
straw
i
merely
asked
because
you
looked
as
if
you
d
been
discussing
them
serlo
serlo
no
sign
of
jack
straw
i
m
not
driving
you
away
am
i
serlo
not
at
all
sir
i
thought
i
d
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
party
jack
straw
do
go
and
pretend
you
re
me
there
s
a
good
fellow
and
shake
hands
with
some
of
those
confounded
people
you
ll
see
where
i
ought
to
stand
because
there
s
a
little
piece
of
red
carpet
on
the
lawn
serlo
i
m
afraid
they
re
not
takin
any
of
me
sir
jack
straw
the
only
advantage
i
ve
ever
been
able
to
find
in
being
a
royal
personage
is
that
when
anybody
s
in
your
way
you
just
tell
him
to
go
and
he
goes
ethel
why
did
you
want
lord
serlo
to
go
sir
jack
straw
because
i
wanted
to
be
alone
with
you
ask
me
another
quickly
ethel
oughtn
t
i
to
help
mother
to
receive
people
jack
straw
i
m
sure
you
ought
but
you
see
that
s
another
advantage
of
being
a
royal
personage
that
you
can
t
go
till
i
give
you
your
dismissal
i
say
don
t
you
hate
parties
ethel
dreadfully
jack
straw
so
do
let
s
pretend
there
isn
t
one
shall
we
i
say
why
don
t
you
sit
down
and
make
yourself
comfy
ethel
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
talk
with
you
sir
jack
straw
that
s
jolly
i
wish
we
had
a
regiment
of
soldiers
there
to
turn
all
those
people
out
ethel
may
i
say
anything
i
like
to
you
sir
jack
straw
good
heavens
why
not
ethel
until
i
was
sixteen
the
most
exalted
person
i
d
ever
met
in
my
life
was
a
london
county
councillor
i
m
not
quite
sure
if
i
know
how
to
behave
with
royal
personages
jack
straw
why
on
earth
don
t
you
buy
a
book
on
etiquette
i
always
carry
one
about
with
me
ethel
mother
bought
several
when
you
said
you
d
come
down
jack
straw
i
wonder
if
she
s
got
the
same
as
mine
you
know
i
never
can
remember
to
call
a
serviette
a
napkin
ethel
mamma
s
very
particular
about
that
jack
straw
and
look
here
d
you
know
that
you
ought
never
to
call
a
chicken
a
fowl
it
s
awfully
bad
form
i
wonder
if
that
s
in
your
mother
s
books
i
say
what
charming
eyes
you
have
ethel
that
s
another
of
the
advantages
of
being
a
royal
personage
that
you
can
make
pretty
speeches
and
no
one
takes
them
seriously
jack
straw
but
you
know
i
m
a
very
insignificant
royal
personage
you
mustn
t
think
i
m
anything
very
grand
really
ethel
it
s
very
nice
of
you
to
say
so
jack
straw
you
see
there
are
archdukes
and
duchesses
in
pomerania
my
grandfather
had
seventeen
children
and
they
all
married
how
many
children
would
each
have
had
to
make
of
us
ethel
it
sounds
very
difficult
jack
straw
but
you
see
i
can
t
be
very
important
can
i
and
of
course
i
ve
got
practically
no
money
to
speak
of
ethel
it
s
very
good
of
you
to
put
me
at
my
ease
then
you
wont
mind
if
i
say
exactly
what
i
want
to
jack
straw
you
won
t
give
me
good
advice
will
you
i
ve
got
relations
and
they
all
do
that
ethel
i
wouldn
t
venture
jack
straw
i
ll
bear
whatever
else
you
say
with
fortitude
we
ll
pretend
that
you
re
just
miss
ethel
as
in
point
of
fact
i
am
jack
straw
and
that
i
m
jack
straw
ethel
why
on
earth
jack
straw
jack
straw
it
s
the
name
of
a
in
hampstead
pray
go
on
ethel
i
wondered
if
you
d
do
me
a
great
favour
jack
straw
ask
me
for
the
moon
and
it
shall
be
left
at
your
front
door
by
carter
paterson
morning
ethel
it
s
something
much
simpler
than
that
jack
straw
put
me
out
of
suspense
quickly
ethel
i
should
be
very
much
obliged
if
if
you
d
go
away
jack
straw
i
now
ethel
i
didn
t
mean
actually
this
minute
but
if
it
suited
your
arrangements
to
go
jack

you

t
mean
to
say
you
want
me
to
go
away
altogether
ethel
that
is
precisely
what
i
did
mean
jack
straw
couldn
t
you
ask
me
something
easier
than
that
ask
me
for
a
lawyer
who
never
told
a
lie
and
i
ll
deliver
him
to
you
bound
hand
and
foot
ethel
i
don
t
happen
to
want
one
just
at
this
moment
thank
you
jack
straw
but
i
m
having
a
very
jolly
time
down
here
ethel
a
change
of
don
t
you
see
that
you
re
exposing
me
every
day
to
the
most
cruel
humiliation
jack
straw
i
thought
i
was
making
myself
so
pleasant
ethel
oh
don
t
pretend
you
don
t
understand
i
ve
seen
the
twinkle
in
your
eyes
when
my
mother
set
a
little
trap
for
you
to
fall
in
jack
straw
i
always
fall
in
very
neatly
ethel
but
what
do
you
think
i
felt
when
i
knew
how
clearly
you
saw
that
she
was
throwing
me
at
your
head
jack
straw
it
s
a
distinctly
pleasing
sensation
to
have
a
pretty
girl
thrown
at
your
head
ethel
it
was
only
a
joke
to
you
you
don
t
know
how
ashamed
i
was
jack
straw
but
why
do
you
suppose
i
came
down
to
taverner
to
see
your
father
and
mother
ethel
i
don
t
know
why
you
came
unless
it
was
to
make
me
desperately
wretched
jack
straw
what
would
you
say
if
i
told
you
that
i
came
because
i
loved
you
at
first
sight
ethel
i
should
say
that
your
royal
highness
was
very
polite
jack
straw
now
look
here
don
t
you
think
i
m
rather
nice
really
ethel
it
would
surely
be
very
impertinent
of
me
to
have
any
opinion
on
the
subject
jack
straw
our
friend
serlo
would
describe
that
as
one
in
the
eye
ethel
would
you
allow
me
to
go
back
to
my
mother
s
guests
sir
jack
straw
do
you
think
you
d
like
me
any
better
if
i
weren
t
an
archduke
ethel
i
haven
t
thought
about
it
jack
straw
then
please
give
the
matter
your
immediate
attention
ethel
i
should
certainly
like
you
no
less
jack
straw
i
have
no
doubt
that
if
i
were
just
a
penniless
adventurer
you
d
simply
dote
upon
me
ethel
i
don
t
know
if
i
d
put
it
quite
so
strongly
as
that
jack
straw
you
know
i
m
afraid
you
re
hopelessly
romantic
you
ve
confessed
your
attachment
to
me
and
just
because
i
happen
incautiously
to
have
chosen
an
emperor
for
my
grandfather
you
want
me
to
go
away
it
s
so
unreasonable
ethel
but
i
haven
t
confessed
anything
of
the
sort
jack
straw
i
look
upon
your
request
that
i
should
go
away
as
equivalent
to
an
avowal
of
undying
passion
ethel
shall
i
tell
you
what
i
would
say
to
you
if
you
weren
t
an
archduke
jack
straw
yes
ethel
i
d
say
you
were
the
most
audacious
impudent
and
impertinent
man
i
d
ever
seen
in
my
life
gives
a
rapid
ironical
curtsey
and
goes
out
he
is
about
to
follow
her
lady
wanley
holland
jack
straw
and
shakes
hands
with
jack
straw

was
hoping
to
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
you
wrote
me
a
little
note
holland
holland
i
ventured
to
ask
if
i
might
have
a
few
minutes
private
conversation
with
you
jack
straw
perhaps
you
wouldn
t
mind
waiting
here
i
will
rejoin
you
immediately
goes
holland
you
know
he
positively
freezes
me
lady
wanley

a
moment
that
he
s
only
holland
take
care
looks
lady
wanley
no
one
will
come
here
we
can
talk
quite
safely
holland
i
wish
to
goodness
we
hadn
t
ever
thought
of
this
fool
trick
i
knew
it
would
lead
to
all
sorts
of
bother
lady
wanley
it
s
no
good
saying
that
now
we
must
keep
our
heads
and
get
out
of
it
as
best
we
can
holland
what
are
you
going
to
do
lady
wanley
oh
that
s
just
like
a
man
you
re
trying
to
put
the
whole
blame
on
me
what
are
going
to
do
holland
well
we
must
finish
with
it
as
quickly
as
we
can
lady
wanley
whatever
happens
there
must
be
no
scene
i
couldn
t
bear
to
see
him
publicly
humiliated
holland
why
on
earth
should
you
think
of
him
lady
wanley
oh
i
m
such
a
fool
ambrose
holland
my
dear
what
you
mean
lady
wanley
after
all
i
m
not
a
girl
i
m
the
mother
of
two
healthy
boys
with
enormous
appetites
i
think
the
man
has
bewitched
me
holland
good
lord
lady
wanley
it
s
no
good
saying
that
of
course
he
s
the
most
fascinating
creature
i
ve
ever
seen
in
my
life
holland
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
re
seriously
in
love
with
him
lady
wanley
a
widow
with
a
sense
of
humour
is
never
seriously
in
love
with
anybody
holland
well
lady
wanley
but
i
think
it
s
much
better
the
young
man
should
disappear
as
mysteriously
as
he
came
holland
there
we
re
quite
agreed
and
we
ll
tell
him
so
with
considerable
frankness
jack
straw
jack
straw
now
my
dear
people
i
am
at
your
service
holland
lady
wanley
sitting
jack
straw
who
rises
holland
oh
don
t
be
such
an
ass
jack
jack
straw
i
beg
your
pardon
perhaps
you
d
be
good
enough
to
put
down
my
hat
holland
it
and
flings
it
crossly
on
a
jack
straw
i
don
t
think
you
re
in
a
very
good
humour
this
afternoon
holland
i
venture
to
think
your
manners
leave
something
to
be
desired
holland
look
here
we
ve
had
enough
of
this
tomfoolery
jack
straw
pray
sit
down
it
distresses
me
to
see
you
standing
holland
i
believe
the
man
s
out
of
his
senses
lady
wanley
have
you
forgotten
the
waiter
s
uniform
which
fitted
you
so
wonderfully
mr
straw
jack
straw
quite
i
only
remember
the
condition
your
ladyship
was
good
enough
to
agree
to
when
i
accepted
your
humorous
suggestion
holland
but
look
here
we
must
talk
the
matter
out
jack
straw
i
am
quite
willing
to
listen
to
you
my
dear
holland
your
conversation
is
often
interesting
and
sometimes
epigrammatic
i
stipulate
only
that
you
should
use
those
forms
of
politeness
which
are
usual
between
a
person
of
your
position
and
a
person
of
mine
holland
i
should
never
have
consented
to
this
folly
if
i
d
known
to
what
it
was
going
to
lead
in
a
moment
of
uncontrollable
irritation
because
jennings
had
behaved
with
the
greatest
insolence
to
a
defenceless
girl
we
made
up
our
minds
to
punish
her
there
was
no
great
harm
in
it
we
thought
perhaps
she
d
ask
you
to
dinner
and
there
would
be
an
end
of
it
it
never
dawned
on
us
that
you
d
come
and
stay
here
indefinitely
jack
straw
my
dear
fellow
why
should
you
blame
me
for
your
own
lack
of
intelligence
holland
ugh

a
way
with

it
lady

holland
i
have
no
intention
whatever
of
stirring

spot
jack
straw
i
ve
been
wondering
for
the
last
week
what
i
should
do
if

signified
his
dismissal
to
any
one
and
he
flatly
refused
to

awkward

it
lady

a
hundred
years

of

words
for

kicked
out
of
the
house
by
the
servants
jack
straw
you
forget
that
you
d
be

out
with
me
holland
now
look
here
jack
we
ve
been
old
pals

ve
gone
through
a
deuce
of
a
lot
together

don

want
to
say
beastly
things
to
you
i
know
i
ve
made
a
fool
of

but
you
re
a
decent
chap
you
must
see
that
it
s
necessary
for
you
to
go
at
once
jack
straw
i
can
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
anything
of
the
sort
i
have
no
other
engagements
and
the
country
is
charming
at
this
time
of
year
holland
you

behaving
like
a
common
impostor
jack
straw
what
language
to
use
to
a
royal
personage
i
assure
you
we
re
not
used
to
such
frankness
holland
do
you
deliberately
refuse
to
go
jack
straw
deliberately
holland
and
shall
i
tell
you
why
jack
straw
i
happen
to
know
thank
you
holland
you
re
going
to
commit
the
most
disgraceful
action
of
your
life
do
you
think
any
one
can
t
see
that
you
re
madly
in
love
with
ethel
jennings
lady
wanley
to
her
is
that
true
jack
straw
quite
lady

then
why
have
you
been
flirting
with
me
so
disgracefully
jack
straw
i
assure
you
i
had
no
intention
of
doing
so
it
must
be
my
unfortunate
manner
lady
wanley
it
s
an
unfortunate
manner
that
s
quite
likely
to
get
you
into
trouble
with
widow
ladies
jack
straw
in
that
case
you
can
only
applaud
my
determination
to
marry
as
quickly
as
possible
holland
not
ethel
jennings
lady
wanley
you
must
be
joking
jack
straw
my
dear
madam
when
i
make
a
joke
i
always
laugh
quickly
so
that
there
should
be
no
doubt
about
it
holland
it
s
preposterous
i
shall
allow
you
to
do
nothing
of
the
sort
jack
straw
my
dear
fellow
what
is
the
use
of
getting
violently
excited
about
it
more
especially
as
i
haven
t
yet
proposed
to
the
young
lady
holland
i
think
you
must
be
stark
staring
mad
you
don
t
suppose
for
a
moment
that
we
shall
allow
you
to
carry
out
such
an
odious
deception
i
can
t
imagine
how
you
can
even
think
of
anything
so
heartless
and
cruel
lady
wanley
it
s
going
too
far
you
must
understand
that
it
s
impossible
i
beseech
you
to
leave
taverner
immediately
jack
straw
it
drives
me
to
distraction
that
i
should
have
to
refuse
your
smallest
whim
but
in
this
matter
a
dramatic
i
am
adamant
holland
now
look
here
we
ve
talked
about
it
enough
either
you
leave
this
place
immediately
or
i
shall
tell
jennings
the
whole
story
jack
straw
it
is
only
fair
to
give
you
that
satisfaction
that
was
part
of
our
arrangement
holland
you
realise
the
consequences
jack
straw
i
did
that
before
i
entered
into
your
scheme
holland
you
leave
me
no
alternative
jack
straw
my
dear
holland
i
really
believe
you
re
rather
nervous
about
the
disclosure
which
it
is
evidently
your
duty
to
make
holland
for
your
own
sake
i
ask
you
once
more
will
you
give
me
your
word
of
honour
to
leave
the
house
and
under
no
circumstances
communicate
with
any
member
of
the
family
jack
straw
it
s
charming
of
you
to
give
me
one
more
chance
i
can
only
repeat
that
i
am
deeply
in
love
with
ethel
and
i
have
every
intention
of
marrying
her

your
blood
be
upon
your
own
head

over

it
lady

m
not
there
to
receive
her
jack
straw
holland
has
a
communication
to
make
which
can
not
fail
to
interest
you
oh
of
course
if
it
s
your
royal
ighness
s
wish
holland
i
daresay
you
remember
that
a
fortnight
ago
we
all
met
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
how
could
i
forget
when
that
was
the
auspicious
occasion
of
my
introduction
to
his
royal
ighness
lady
wanley
ambrose
holland
you
may
remember
also
that
and
abbott
were
sitting
with
us
in
the
lounge
i
ave
other
things
to
do
than
to
remember
where
and
abbott
were
sitting
holland
i
daresay
you
ve
forgotten
that
you
behaved
very
cruelly
to
her
we
were
all
very
indignant
we
thought
it
necessary
to
punish
you
really
holland
i
don
t
know
who
you
think
you
re
talking
to
holland
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
say
what
i
have
to
i
realise
now
that
the
whole
business
has
been
preposterously
silly
i
can
manage
far
better
if
you
don
t
interrupt
jack
straw
please
let
him
go
on
jennings
of
of
course
if
your
royal
ighness
wishes
it
i
ave
no
more
to
say
holland
it
struck
me
that
it
would
be
amusing
to
pass
off
a
nobody
as
a
person
of
great
consequence
i
had
just
recognised
one
of
the
waiters
as
an
old
friend
of
mine

introduced
him
to
you
as
the
archduke
sebastian
of
pomerania

babylon
hotel

the
sober

scene
now
mater
d
you

to
say
i
ve
got
to

still
and
lump
it
jack

if

what

all
the
county

here
maria
de
la
oh
i
wish
they
were
all
dead
i
know
why
they
come
here
d
you
think
i
don
t
know
that
they
call
me
a
vulgar
old
woman
behind
my
back
but
they
come
all
the
same
because
i
ve
got
two
millions
of
money
i
m
so
rich
that
they
can
t
elp
coming
jack
straw
you
know
i
don
t
want
to
seem
stuck
up
but
in
point
of
fact
they
ve
come
to
meet
me
don
t
you
think
i
d
better
go
and
make
myself
amiable
to
them
holland
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
re
going
back
to
them
jack
straw
why
not
ave
i
got
to
introduce
you
to
the
duchess
jack
straw
i
m
afraid
she
ll
make
a
point
of
it
even
duchesses
have
a
weakness
for
royal
personages
if
she
ever
finds
out
jack
straw
the
situation
is
not
without
an
element
of
humour
well
upon
my
soul
you
ave
got
a
cheek
jack
straw
the
motto
on
my
coat
of
arms
is
audacity
only
we
put
it
in
latin
because
it
sounds
better
vincent
your
coat
of
arms
i
like
that
jack
straw
my
dear
fellow
i
have
no
doubt
it
is
as
authentic
as
yours
and
do
you
mean
to
say
i
ve
got
to
pretend
i
don
t
know
anything
jack
straw
i
think
it
s
the
only
thing
to
do
i
can
never
do
it
i
shall
never
old
up
my
ead
again
jack
straw
come
i
am
convinced
that
the
duchess
is
growing
restive
i
will
murmur
a
few
soft
nothings
in
her
ear
oh
well
i
suppose
the
only
thing
is
to
risk
it
but
you
just
wait
young
man
you
wait
jack
straw
i
think
i
can
promise
you
that
no
one
here
will
blow
the
gaff
upon
my
soul
you
talk
as
if
i
was
the
criminal
starts
and
stops
suddenly
with
a
holland
what
s
the
matter
oh
it
give
me
such
a
turn
what
s
to
be
done
now
the
count
holland
how
d
you
mean
i
d
forgotten
all
about
him
count
von
bremer
coming
jack
straw
who
the
deuce
is
he
holland
he
s
your
ambassador
jack
straw
of
course
how
stupid
of
me
lady
wanley
a
little
scornful
but
he
won
t
come
don
t
you
make
too
sure
about
that
he
s
coming
right
enough
the
british
aristocracy
was
quite
willing
to
with
the
but
this
duty
foreigner
wouldn
t
be
seen
in
the
same
street
with
us
and
you
all
sniggered
up
your
sleeves
because
you
thought
you
was
getting
a
bit
of
your
own
back
but
i
ve
got
im
and
i
was
going
to
fling
him
in
your
faces
i
wrote
im
a
personal
letter
as
if
i
d
known
him
all
my
life
and
said
jack
straw
well
and
said
is
royal
ighness
particularly
wished
him
to
come
i
sent
the
letter
by
one
of
the
footmen
this
morning
jack
straw
by
jove
holland
well
they
mustn
t
meet
you
must
say
that
the
archduke
has
been
seized
with
sudden
indisposition
every
one
knows
he
was
quite
well
half
an
hour
ago
lady
wanley
besides
count
von
bremer
would
probably
insist
on
seeing
him
it
must
have
come
as
a
great
surprise
that
the
archduke
sebastian
had
turned
up
jack
straw
my
dear
people
don
t
put
yourselves
out
if
count
von
bremer
has
come
here
to
see
me
it
would
be
manifestly
most
discourteous
to
rob
him
of
that
pleasure
holland
i
think
you
re
quite
mad
jack
jack
straw
unless
i
m
greatly
mistaken
count
von
bremer
has
excessively
bad
sight
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
re
going
to
meet
im
face
to
face
jack
straw
remember
that
there
are
archdukes
in
pomerania
ethel
you
told
me
a
little
while
ago
jack
straw
i
have
since
seen
in
the
paper
that
the
archduchess
anastasia
has
had
twins
which
makes
what
more
probable
than
that
the
ambassador
has
never
seen
the
archduke
sebastian
oh
but
what
a
risk
to
take
it
s
enough
to
turn
my
false
air
grey
jack
straw
in
any
case
he
can
t
have
set
eyes
on
him
for
four
years
because
nobody
has
i
suppose
it
asn
t
struck
you
that
he
may
talk
to
you
in
pomeranian
jack
straw
have
you
ever
met
a
waiter
who
couldn
t
discourse
fluently
in
seven
languages
at
least
does
that
mean
you
can
talk
the
count
s
beastly
language
jack
straw
like
a
beastly
native
madam
but
i
may
suggest
to
you
that
there
will
be
no
need
since
if
i
address
the
count
in
english
it
would
be
the
height
of
discourtesy
for
him
to
answer
in
any
other
tongue
well
of
all
the
cheek
i
ve
ever
come
across
in
my
life
you
just
about
take
the
cake
holland
but
look
here
i
remember
seeing
the
archduke
described
as
a
very
handsome
man
jack
straw
spare
my
blushes
dear
friend
we
are
as
like
as
two
peas
withers

abrupt

comfortable

trying
to
be
funny
and
so
easy
when

trying
to
be

t
want

my
footman

take
you
by
the
scruff
of
the
neck
and
jack
straw
my
dear
lady

perfectly
calm

our
tempers

t
go

it
in
such
a
brutal
way

that

not
tear
myself
away
from
your
hospitable
roof

you

to
give

to
stand
there
like
a
stuffed
owl
jack

do
my
eyes
deceive
me
or
is
that
a
local
paper
that
i
see
takes
it
ah
i
surmised
that
it
would
have
an
account
of
your
garden
party
two
columns
of
it
by
jove
you
must
wish
you
hadn
t
asked
so
many
people
the
duchess
of
erth
the
marchioness
of
mereston
the
marquess
of
mereston
lord
and
lady
hollington
viscount
parnaby
dear
me
how
smart
lady
wanley
and
lamberville
the
bishop
of
sheffield
and
the
honourable
spratte
i
say
won
t
your
humbler
friends
grind
their
teeth
with
envy
but
doesn
t
it
say
anything
about
me
here
it
is
the
archduke
sebastian
looked
every
inch
a
i
said
so
to
oh
spare
my
blushes
his
royal
highness
enchanted
every
one
by
the
grace
of
his
bearing
and
the
charm
of
his
imperial
blood
will
tell
are
you
going
to
stand
there
and
let
this
man
insult
me
robert
jack
straw
and
what
do
you
imagine
all
these
noble
and
distinguished
persons
will
think
when
they
read
in
the
next
number
of
the
local
paper
that
the
royal
personage
whose
hand
they
were
so
pleased
to
shake
i
did
my
duty
like
a
hero
didn
t
i
was
serving
coffee
and
liqueurs
a
fortnight
ago
in
the
grand
babylon
hotel
oh
be
quiet
you
jack
straw
i
can
hear
a
titter
rising
softly
in
the
village
with
the
doctor
and
the
parson
and
the
solicitor
whom
you
didn
t
ask
to
your
party
and
i
can
hear
it
increase
to
a
ripple
of
laughter
as
the
story
spreads
through
cheshire
i
can
hear
a
homeric
peal
as
it
travels
from
county
to
county
it
s
a
great
guffaw
in
manchester
and
liverpool
and
the
cities
of
the
north
and
already
i
hear
the
deep
laughter
of
bristol
and
portsmouth
and
the
west
and
when
it
reaches
london
you
know
how
things
go
in
london
it
s
so
large
that
it
takes
it
a
little
time
really
to
get
hold
of
anything
but
when
at
last
it
comes
can
t
you
see
the
huge
city
holding
its
aching
sides
and
bellowing
with
laughter
but
i
ll
tell
you
who
won
t
see
the
joke
up
the
paper

they
ll
laugh
very
much
on
the
wrong
side
of
their
mouths
the
duchess
of
erth
the
marchioness
of
mereston
and
my
lady
hollington
and
my
lord
parnaby
and
the
bishop
of
sheffield
and
the
honourable
spratte
oh
you
devil
jack
straw
i
can
see
you
flying
before
the
laughter
like
three
tremulous
leaves
before
the
wind
and
the
laughter
will
pursue
you
to
paris
where
they
ll
make
little
songs
about
you
on
the
boulevards
and
the
riviera
where
they
ll
sell
your
photographs
on
picture
postcards
i
can
see
you
fleeing
across
the
atlantic
to
hide
your
heads
in
the
immensity
of
america
and
there
the
yellow
press
with
frenzy
will
pile
column
of
ridicule
upon
column
of
invective
oh
my
dear
lady
do
you
think
it
isn
t
worth
while
to
endure

hundred
pounds

to

bishop

to
tell
me
harrowing
stories
about
the
immorality
of
the
very
best
people

when

von
bremer
came
on
the
scene
and
you
were
all
at
your
wits
end
i
carried
the
whole
thing
off

a
way

describing

superb
how
he
didn
t
find
you

i
ask
jennings
there
you

beginning
to
think
we

i
feel
that
he
ll
stay
on
here
always
i
can
see
him
growing
old
under
this
roof
eating
my
food
and
drinking
my
wine
and
sending
in
his
tailor
s
bills
for
jennings
to
pay
and
it
s
all
your
doing
holland
i
m
very
sorry
i
promise
you
that
what
s
the
good
of
being
sorry

im
and
it

archduke
holland
do
you

an
idea

be
quite
willing
to
go

t

seem
disagreeable
but
when

some
sort
of
idea
that

time

have
hooked
it
don
t
you
know
jack
straw
my
dear
holland

me
the
service
of
telling
withers
that
dear
jennings
is
putting
the
roses
into
a
basket
for
her
holland
against
his
it
s
not
the
least
use
being
angry
with
you
jack
i
ll
go
by
all
means
jack
straw
there
goes
a
man
of
tact
if
i
were
a
sultan
i
d
make
him
my
grand
vizier
looks
reflectively
but
very
pointedly
serlo
serlo
what
are
you
starin
at
me
for
jack
straw
i
was
wondering
how
i
could
suggest
to
you
with
proper
delicacy
that
you
might
conveniently
follow
his
example
ethel
i
should
much
prefer
lord
serlo
to
stay
here
jack
straw
i
have
matters
of
some
importance
to
discuss
with
you
ethel
i
am
sure
that
you
have
nothing
to
say
that
lord
serlo
can
not
hear
jack
straw
very
well
i
will
make
an
effort
to
overcome
my
customary
modesty
serlo
i
don
t
know
where
that
comes
in
you

got
about
the
biggest
cheek
that
i
ve
ever
come
across
jack
straw
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
has
been
my
only
means
of
livelihood
for
the
last
four
years
ethel
what
have
you
to
say
to
me
jack
straw
couldn
t
you
give
me
a
slight
smile
just
to
encourage
me
a
little
ethel
you
force
me
to
say
what
i
would
rather
have
left
unsaid
i
m
horrified
that
you
should
be
so
hatefully
cruel
i
think
it
s
infamous
that
you
should
lend
yourself
to
a
stupid
practical
joke
jack
straw
my
dear
serlo
won
t
you
hook
it
ethel
i
want
him
to
stay
jack
straw
it
makes
him
feel
very
uncomfortable
he
s
full
of
tact
too
i
ll
make
him
a
grand
vizier
and
he
s
feeling
awfully
serlo
you
needn
t
bother
about
my
feelings
so
much
as
all
that
you
know
jack
straw
won
t
you
hear
what
i
ve
got
to
say
for
myself
you
don
t
think
i
care
twopence
about
their
practical
joke
i
came
here
because
it
was
my
only
chance
of
seeing
you
ethel
what
you
ve
done
fills
me
with
horror
and
disgust
jack
straw
didn
t
you
see
from
the
first
minute
that
i
was
desperately
in
love
with
you
serlo
i
say
this
really
is
very
awkward
for
me
jack
straw
you
told
me
not
to
bother
about
your
feelings
ethel
to
prevent
a
you
know
you
re
too
absurd
i
know
i
ought
to
be
very
angry
with
you
but
i
can
t
jack
straw
do
you
remember
what
you
said
to
me
yesterday
ethel
no
jack
straw
then
i
ll
remind
you
you
asked
me
to
go
away
because
i
was
a
royal
personage
do
you
still
want
me
to
go
if
i
m
only
a
waiter
ethel
i
might
have
known
that
you
were
laughing
at
me
all
the
time
jack
straw
you
know
if
i
had
been
a
royal
personage
and
disguised
myself
as
a
waiter
in
order
to
be
by
your
side
you
d
have
thought
it
very
romantic
why
should
it
shock
you
when
it
is
a
waiter
who
for
the
same
reason
assumes
the
royal
personage
ethel
if
you
can
t
see
the
difference
it
s
useless
for
me
to
tell
you
jack
straw
won
t
you
marry
me
ethel
serlo
i
say
i
ve
got
a
good
mind
to
kick
you
out
of
the
house
jack
straw
have
you
in
that
case
i
can
only
congratulate
myself
that
i
m
the
champion
amateur
boxer
in
pomerania
serlo
that
complicates
matters
a
bit
don
t
it
jack

upon
my
soul
i
ve
never
made
a
proposal
of
marriage
under
such
embarrassing
circumstances
ethel
now
my
dear

t
be
unreasonable
you
practically
refused
me
yesterday
because
i
was
an
archduke
you
re
not
going
to
refuse
me
now
because
i
m
nobody
in
particular
ethel
and
can
you
give
me
any
reason
why
i
should
accept
you
jack
straw
well
it
may
have
escaped
your
notice
but
there
s
the
very
good
reason
that
you
re
just
as
much
in
love
with
me
as
i
am
with
you
ethel
i
jack
straw
can
you
honestly
deny
it
but
if
you

disbelieve
you

it
s
very
easy
to
convince
you
lord
serlo
you
were
good
enough
to
tell
me
yesterday

i
have
my
grandfather
s
permission
to
ask
you
for
your
daughter

hand
in

but
the
man
s
an
impostor
he
s
no
more
the
archduke
sebastian
than
i
am
withers
what
do
you
mean
oh
well
if
you
like
you
can
ave
it
you
were
there
when
it
all
started
i
suppose
i
got
out
the
wrong
side
of
bed
that
morning
and
when
the
vicar
s
wife
come
up
to
me
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
i
snubbed
her
i
ve
been
very
sorry
for
it
since
and
i
ve
been
punished
for
it
they
knew
i
was
an
old
snob
like
you
florrie
they
thought
they
d
pay
me
out
they
got
one
of
the
waiters
from
the
otel
to
dress
up
like
a
gentleman
and
they
introduced
him
as
the
archduke
sebastian
withers
jack
straw
that
yes
that
he
s
a
waiter
that
s
what
he
is
and
for
the
last
week
i
ve
been
making
a
perfect
fool
of
myself
over
im
von
bremer
but
i
don
t
understand
i
ve
known
the
archduke
sebastian
since
he
was
born
holland
you
re
mistaken
this
person
and
i
were
in
america
together
i
lived
with
him
for
two
years
i
don
t
know
his
real
name
but
he
passes
under
that
of
jack
straw
von
bremer
but
what
you
say
is
absurd
i
know
him
as
well
as
my
own
son
d
you
mean
to
say
he
really
is
an
archduke
von
bremer
of
course
he
is
the
only
mystery
is
how
he
turned
up
here
when
we
ve
been
hunting
the
whole
world
for
the
last
four
years
to
find
him
holland
but
are
you
the
jack
straw
who
was
with
me
in
the
states
jack
straw
yes
lady
wanley
and
are
you
the
waiter
of
the
grand
babylon
hotel
jack
straw
yes
and
are
you
the
archduke
sebastian
of
pomerania
jack
straw
yes
serlo
well
i
m
jiggered
jack
straw
perhaps
you
will
allow
me
to
explain
four
years
ago
i
fell
desperately
in
love
with
a
lady
whose
speciality
it
was
to
kick
higher
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
she
could
kick
a
man
s
tall
hat
off
his
head
with
such
grace
that
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
my
grandfather
refused
to
consent
and
the
lady
was
hurried
over
the
frontier
a
glance
ethel
i
was
a
romantic
dog
myself
in
those
days
and
i
followed
her
only
to
find
that
she
had
already
three
more
or
less
lawful
husbands
the
sight
of
them
and
the
conviction
that
her
peculiar
talent
would
not
greatly
add
to
the
felicity
of
domestic
life
cured
me
of
my
passion
but
the
world
did
seem
a
bit
hollow
and
empty
and
i
thought
i
d
see
how
it
looked
from
the
point
of
view
of
a
man
who
had
nothing
but
his
wits
to
live
on
after
trying
it
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
much
prefer
living
on
the
revenues
which
rise
from
the
strength
of
arm
of
my
ancestors
when
you
saw
me
at
the
grand
babylon
hotel
i
was
preparing
to
return
to
the
bosom
of
my
family
but
i
saw
this
young
lady
and
the
chance
offering
decided
to
come
down
here
it
was
not
unnatural
that
when
i
was
asked
to
assume
a
grandiloquent
name
i
should
assume
my
own
yesterday
when
i
met
count
von
bremer
i
begged
him
to
wire
to
the
emperor
asking
for
his
consent
to
my
marriage
with
miss
ethel
jennings
von
bremer
i
have
only
to
add
that
the
emperor
delighted
with
the
prospect
of
seeing
once
more
his
favourite
grandson
has
gladly
given
his
consent
and
when
i
think
of
all
the
things
i
ve
called
you
these
last
few
hours
jack
straw
they
went
in
at
the
ear
of
a
waiter
madam
and
slipped
out
at
that
of
an
archduke
goes
up
ethel
jack
straw
and
now
it
only
rests
with
you
to
give
peace
to
an
aged
emperor
satisfaction
to
archdukes
and
happiness
to
your
unworthy
servant
ethel
i
am
engaged
to
be
married
to
lord
serlo
what
i
know
nothing
about
this
jack
straw
i
knew
our
mamma
wouldn
t
be
pleased
ethel
the
fact
remains
jack
straw
serlo
now
my
dear
friend
you
ve
got
the
chance
of
a
lifetime
it
s
quite
clear
to
me
that
there
s
only
one
course
open
to
you
take
the
centre
of
the
stage
and
renounce
the
lady
with
all
the
moving
expressions
you
can
think
of
serlo
look
here
old
man
i
don
t
think
i
quite
like
the
way
you
keep
on
pulling
my
leg
jack
straw
put
a
little
dignity
into
it
man
serlo
i
may
be
a
blithering
ass
but
i
can
see
without
your
tellin
me
that
ethel
wouldn
t
have
had
me
at
any
price
if
she
hadn
t
wanted
to
score
off
you
jack
straw
oh
how
some
men
throw
away
their
chances
strike
the
pathetic
note
old
man
or
you
re
done
when
you
ve
finished
there
oughtn
t
to
be
a
dry
eye
in
the
place
serlo
well
the
fact
is
it
had
entirely
slipped
my
memory
at
the
moment
but
i
had
a
letter
this
morning
from
the
lady
s
solicitor
to
remind
me
i
happen
to
be
engaged
to
a
young
woman
who
can
kick
a
man
s
topper
off
too
jack
straw
by
jove
i
wonder
if
it
s
the
same
one
ethel
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
serlo
well
you
know
it
was
a
bit
awk
when
you
er
jack
straw
threw
yourself
at
his
head
ethel
jack
straw
with
a
i
ought
to
be
very
angry
with
you
you
ve
laughed
at
me
all
the
time
i
don
t
believe
you
ll
ever
take
me
seriously
if
i
really
were
the
romantic
creature
you
say
i
am
i
d
be
very
dignified
and
refuse
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
at
all
jack
straw
but
like
all
women
you
re
very
sensible
at
heart
and
you
ll
do
nothing
of
the
kind
ethel
it
s
not
because
i
m
sensible
but
because
i
suppose
you
were
quite
right
in
what
you
said
just
now
jack
straw
bless
you
i
d
throw
myself
down
on
the
floor
and
implore
you
to
walk
on
me
only
i
m
convinced
you
d
take
me
at
my
word
enormous
i
knew
he
was
an
archduke
all
the
time
you
can
t
deceive
a
mother
jack
straw
a
there
s
one
thing
i
must
break
to
you
at
once
pomerania
is
in
some
ways
still
a
barbarous
country
we
have
a
dreadful
law
that
when
a
member
of
the
royal
family
marries
a
foreigner
not
of
royal
blood
his
wife
s
relations
are
prohibited
from
entering
it
i
should
like
to
see
any
one
prohibit
me
from
going
to
see
my
own
daughter
jack
straw
my
dear
lady
it
grieves
me
infinitely
to
say
it
but
no
sooner
had
you
crossed
our
frontier
than
you
would
be
instantly
beheaded
truly
sir
a
barbarous
