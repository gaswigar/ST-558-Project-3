for

now
every

last
christmas
was
the
third
on
which
oliver
and
edson
ralph
and
guy
carolyn
and
nan
were
all
at
the
familiar
fireside
as
they
used
to
be
in
the
days
before
they
were
married
the
wives
and
husbands
and
children
go
too
when

can

with

no

them
down

carolyn
youngest
baby
who
was
not
a

old
last
christmas
has
sustained
a
particle
of
harm
from
the
snowy
journey
to
north
estabrook
tucked
away
though
it
is
among
the
hills
where
the
drifts
are
deep
taking
them
all
together
they
are
quite
a
company
and
as
father
and
mother
fernald
are
getting
rather
well
along
in
years
and
such
a
means
a
good
deal
of
preparation
last
year
their
younger
daughter
nan
and
her
husband
sam
burnett
and
their
youngest
son
guy
and
his
wife
of
a
year
margaret
went
up
to
north
estabrook
two
days
ahead
of
the
rest
to
help
with
the
finishing
labours
sam
burnett
and
guy
fernald
being
busy
young
men
all
the
year
round
thought
it
great
sport
to
get
up
into
the
country
in
the
winter
and
planned
for
a
fortnight
beforehand
to
be
able
to
manage
this
brief
vacation
as
for
nan
and
margaret
they
are
always
the
best
of
friends
as
for
father
and
mother
fernald
i
do
know
but
this
is
the
best
part
of
the
party
mused
john
fernald
looking
from
one
to
another
of
them
and
then
at
his
wife
as
they
sat
together
before
the
fireplace
on
the
evening
of
the
arrival
it
was
all
over
so
quick
last
year
and
you
were
all
piling
back
to
town
to
your
offices
in
such
a
hurry
you
boys
now
we
can
have
a
spell
of
quiet
talk
before
the
fun
begins
that
suits
us
to
a
t
eh
mother
fernald
nodded
smiling
her
hand
held
fast
in
guy
rested
on
his
knee
nan
charming
head
with
its
modish
dressing
lay
against
her
shoulder
what
more
could
a
mother
ask
across
the
fireplace
sam
burnett
most
satisfactory
of
and
margaret
guy
best
beloved
who
had
made
the
year
one
long
honeymoon
to
him
so
he
declared
completed
the
little
circle
there
was
much
to
talk
about
to
begin
with
there
was
everybody
in
north
estabrook
to
inquire
after
and
though
north
estabrook
is
but
a
very
small
village
it
takes
time
to
inquire
after
everybody
quite
suddenly
having
asked
solicitously
concerning
a
very
old
woman
who
had
nursed
most
of
the
fernald
children
in
their
infancy
and
was
always
remembered
by
them
with
affection
it
occurred
to
nan
to
put
a
question
which
had
been
on
her
mind
ever
since
she
had
come
into
town
on
the
afternoon
stage
speaking
of
aunt
eliza
mother
makes
me
think
of
the
old
church
she
used
to
talk
so
much
about
liking
to
hear
the
bell
ring
right
up
over
her
head
next
door
the
bell
ever
ring
these
days
or
have
cobwebs
grown
over
the
clapper
a
shadow
dropped
upon
fernald
bright
face
but
before
she
could
speak
her
husband
answered
for
her
he
was
more
than
a
little
deaf
but
he
was
listening
closely
and
he
caught
the
question
it
a
miserable
shame
nancy
but
that
church
has
had
a
door
open
since
a
year
ago
last
july
when
the
trouble
burst
out
we
have
had
a
service
there
since
mother
and
i
drive
over
to
estabrook
when
we
feel
like
getting
out
but
that
not
often
come
being
the
only
church
building
in
this
end
of
the
township
it
pretty
bad
having
it
closed
up
but
there
the
fuss
folks
ca
agree
what
to
do
and
nobody
dares
get
a
preacher
here
and
try
to
start
things
up
on
their
own
responsibility
but
we
feel
it
we
sure
do
i
do
like
to
look
at
the
old
going
by
i
declare
i
do
it
looks
lonesome
to
me
and
there
where
every
one
of
you
children
grew
up
too
sitting
there
in
the
old
family
pew
with
your
legs
dangling
it
too
bad
too
bad
it
barbarous
guy
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
disgust
and
all
over
nothing
of
any
real
consequence
sighed
fernald
in
her
gentle
way
we
would
have
given
up
our
ideas
gladly
for
the
sake
of
harmony
but
there
were
so
many
who
felt
it
necessary
to
fight
to
have
their
own
way
and
feel
that
way
still
i
suppose
suggested
sam
burnett
cheerfully
there
a
whole
lot
of
that
in
the
world
i
experienced
it
myself
at
times
they
talked
about
it
for
a
few
minutes
the
younger
men
rather
enjoying
the
details
of
the
quarrel
as
those
may
who
are
outside
of
an
affair
sufficiently
far
to
see
its
inconsistencies
and
humours
but
it
was
clearly
a
subject
which
gave
pain
to
the
older
people
and
guy
perceiving
this
was
about
to
divert
the
talk
into
pleasanter
channels
when
nan
gave
a
little
cry
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
fire
as
if
she
saw
there
something
startling
people
let
open
the
church
ourselves
and
have
a
christmas
day
service
there
they
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
thinking
her
half
dreaming
but
her
face
was
radiant
with
the
light
of
an
idea
which
was
not
an
idle
dream
guy
began
to
laugh
and
expect
the
rival
factions
to
come
flocking
peaceably
in
like
lambs
to
the
fold
i
think
i
see
them
ignore
the
rival
factions
have
a
service
for
everybody
a
real
christmas
service
with
holly
and
ropes
of
greens
and
a
star
and
music
and
a
sermon
she
ended
a
little
more
doubtfully
the
sermon
by
all
means
quoth
sam
burnett
preach
at
when
once
you
caught
they
enjoy
that
we
all
do
but
it
really
a
beautiful
idea
said
margaret
her
young
face
catching
the
glow
from
nan
i
do
see
why
it
could
be
carried
out
of
course
you
do
guy
spoke
decidedly
if
people
were
all
like
you
there
would
be
any
quarrels
but
unfortunately
they
are
not
and
when
i
think
of
the
tomlinsons
and
the
frasers
and
the
hills
and
the
pollocks
all
going
in
at
the
same
door
for
a
christmas
day
service
under
that
roof
well
he
gave
a
soft
long
whistle
it
rather
strains
my
imagination
not
that
they
are
all
good
people
you
know
oh
yes
if
they
were
they
knock
each
other
down
in
the
street
and
have
it
over
with
and
a
splendid
thing
it
would
be
too
but
i
tell
you
it
strains
my
imagination
to
let
it
strain
it
it
a
good
thing
to
exercise
the
imagination
now
and
then
that
the
way
changes
come
i
do
think
the
idea
such
a
bad
one
myself
sam
burnett
spoke
seriously
and
nan
gave
him
a
grateful
glance
she
was
pretty
sure
of
sam
backing
in
most
reasonable
things
and
a
substantial
backing
it
was
to
have
too
who
would
conduct
such
a
service
fernald
asked
thoughtfully
you
could
get
anybody
out
to
church
on
christmas
morning
broke
in
fernald
chuckling
every
mother
daughter
of
will
be
basting
her
christmas
turkey
then
have
it
christmas
evening
why
not
the
day
is
over
nobody
knows
what
to
do
christmas
evening
except
go
to
dances
and
never
a
dance
in
north
estabrook
whom
can
we
get
to
lead
it
well
nan
paused
thinking
it
out
her
eyes
roamed
from
sam
to
her
fathers
and
from
there
on
around
the
circle
while
they
all
waited
for
her
to
have
an
inspiration
nobody
else
had
one
presently
as
they
expected
for
nan
was
a
resourceful
young
person
her
face
lighted
up
again
she
gazed
at
margaret
smiling
and
her
idea
seemed
to
communicate
itself
to
guy
wife
together
they
cried
in
one
breath
billy
billy
guy
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
with
delight
at
the
notion
the
reverend
billy
of
johns
coming
up
to
north
estabrook
to
take
charge
of
a
service
why
be
dining
in
purple
and
fine
linen
at
the
home
of
one
of
his
millionaire
parishioners
the
edgecombs
most
likely
i
think
they
adore
him
most
why
do
you
ask
the
bishop
himself
margaret
flushed
brightly
the
reverend
william
sewall
was
her
brother
he
might
be
the
very
manly
and
dignified
young
rector
of
a
fashionable
city
church
but
no
man
who
answers
to
the
name
of
billy
in
his
own
family
can
be
a
really
formidable
personage
and
he
and
his
sister
margaret
were
undeniably
great
chums
of
course
billy
would
cried
margaret
you
know
perfectly
well
he
would
guy
dear
he
does
care
a
straw
about
dinners
he
rather
have
an
evening
with
his
newsboys
club
any
time
he
has
his
own
service
christmas
morning
of
course
but
in
the
evening
he
could
come
up
on
the
afternoon
train
he
love
to
why
billy
a
bachelor
he
nothing
in
the
world
to
keep
him
telephone
him
first
thing
in
the
morning
from
this
point
on
there
was
no
lack
of
enthusiasm
if
billy
sewall
was
coming
to
north
estabrook
as
sam
burnett
remarked
it
was
time
to
get
interested
and
busy
they
discussed
everything
excitement
mounting
the
music
the
trimming
of
the
church
then
more
prosaically
the
cleaning
and
warming
and
lighting
of
it
finally
the
making
known
to
north
estabrook
the
news
of
the
coming
event
for
nothing
less
than
an
event
it
was
sure
to
be
to
north
estabrook
put
a
notice
in
the
post
office
advised
guy
comfortably
crossing
his
legs
and
grinning
at
his
father
and
tell
aunt
eliza
and
miss
jane
pollock
and
the
thing
is
done
sam
i
think
i
see
you
spending
the
next
two
days
at
the
top
of
ladders
hanging
greens
i
have
a
dim
and
hazy
vision
of
you
on
your
knees
before
that
stove
that
always
used
to
smoke
when
the
wind
was
east
the
one
in
the
left
corner
praying
to
it
to
quit
fussing
and
draw
a
nice
restful
christmas
vacation
you
have
sam
burnett
looked
at
his
wife
she
captain
said
he
if
she
wants
to
play
with
the
old
play
she
shall
so
long
as
she
does
ask
me
to
preach
the
sermon
you
old
dear
murmured
nan
jumping
up
to
stand
behind
his
chair
her
two
pretty
arms
encircling
his
stout
neck
from
the
rear
you
preach
a
better
sermon
than
lots
of
ministers
if
you
are
only
an
upright
old
bank
cashier
doubtless
nancy
doubtless
murmured
sam
pleasantly
but
as
it
will
take
the
wisdom
of
a
solomon
the
tact
of
a
paul
and
the
eloquence
of
the
almighty
himself
to
preach
a
sermon
on
the
present
occasion
that
will
divert
the
tomlinsons
and
the
frasers
the
hills
and
the
pollocks
from
glaring
at
each
other
across
the
pews
i
do
think
i
apply
for
the
job
let
billy
sewall
tackle
it
there
one
thing
about
it
if
they
get
to
fighting
in
the
aisles
billy
leap
down
from
the
pulpit
roll
up
his
sleeves
and
pull
the
combatants
apart
a
virile
religion
is
billy
and
i
rather
think
he
the
man
for
the
hour
ii
hi
there
ol
why
not
get
something
doing
with
that
hammer
you
see
the
edge
of
that
pulpit
is
all
frazzled
the
preacher
catch
his
toes
in
it
and
then
where
his
ecclesiastical
dignity
be
the
was
guy
shouting
down
from
the
top
of
a
tall
where
he
was
busy
screwing
into
place
the
freshly
cleaned
whose
radiance
was
to
be
depended
upon
to
illumine
the
ancient
interior
of
the
north
estabrook
church
he
addressed
his
eldest
brother
oliver
who
in
his
newness
to
the
situation
and
his
consequent
lack
of
sympathy
with
the
occasion
was
proving
but
an
indifferent
worker
this
may
have
been
partly
due
to
the
influence
of
oliver
wife
marian
who
sitting
in
russian
sables
in
one
of
the
middle
pews
was
doing
what
she
could
to
depress
the
labourers
the
number
of
these
by
the
way
had
been
reinforced
by
the
arrival
of
the
entire
fernald
clan
to
spend
christmas
your
motive
is
undoubtedly
a
good
one
oliver
conceded
she
spoke
to
nan
busy
near
her
and
she
gazed
critically
about
the
shabby
old
walls
now
rapidly
assuming
a
quite
different
aspect
as
the
great
ropes
of
laurel
leaves
swung
into
place
under
the
direction
of
sam
burnett
that
young
man
now
had
edson
fernald
and
charles
wetmore
husband
to
assist
him
and
he
was
making
the
most
of
his
opportunity
to
order
about
two
gentlemen
who
had
shown
considerable
reluctance
to
remove
their
coats
but
who
were
now
to
his
satisfaction
perspiring
so
freely
that
they
had
some
time
since
reached
the
point
of
casting
aside
still
other
articles
of
apparel
but
i
shall
be
much
surprised
oliver
continued
if
you
attain
your
object
nobody
can
be
more
obstinate
in
their
prejudice
than
the
people
of
such
a
little
place
as
this
you
may
get
them
out
though
i
doubt
even
that
but
you
are
quite
as
likely
as
not
to
set
them
by
the
ears
and
simply
make
matters
worse
it
christmas
replied
nan
her
cheeks
were
the
colour
of
the
holly
berries
in
the
great
wreaths
she
was
arranging
to
place
on
either
side
of
the
wall
behind
the
pulpit
they
ca
quarrel
at
christmas
not
with
billy
sewall
preaching
peace
on
earth
good
will
to
men
to
them
jessica
please
hand
me
that
wire
and
come
and
hold
this
wreath
a
minute
will
you
nobody
expects
marian
to
be
on
any
side
but
the
other
one
consolingly
whispered
jessica
edson
wife
lucky
fellow
as
she
held
the
wreath
for
nan
to
affix
the
wire
what
that
about
sewall
oliver
inquired
i
had
heard
of
that
you
do
mean
to
say
sewell
coming
up
for
this
service
of
course
he
is
margaret
telephoned
him
this
morning
and
he
said
never
had
a
christmas
present
equal
to
this
one
he
said
it
interested
him
a
lot
more
than
his
morning
service
in
town
and
he
be
up
loaded
is
that
fine
of
billy
nan
beamed
triumphantly
at
her
oldest
brother
over
her
holly
wreath
that
puts
a
different
light
on
it
and
oliver
fernald
president
of
the
great
city
bank
of
which
sam
burnett
was
cashier
got
promptly
down
on
the
knees
of
his
freshly
pressed
trousers
and
proceeded
to
tack
the
frazzled
edge
of
the
pulpit
with
interest
and
skill
that
had
been
tacked
by
a
good
many
people
before
him
but
doubtless
it
had
never
been
stretched
into
place
by
a
man
whose
sat
astride
of
a
nose
of
the
impressive
presidential
mould
of
this
one
do
i
understand
that
you
mean
to
attempt
music
oliver
seemed
grieved
at
the
thought
there
are
several
good
voices
in
the
family
of
course
but
you
have
had
time
to
practise
any
christmas
music
together
you
will
have
merely
to
sing
hymns
fortunately
some
of
the
old
hymns
are
christmas
music
of
the
most
exquisite
sort
began
nan
trying
hard
to
keep
her
temper
a
feat
which
was
apt
to
give
her
trouble
when
marian
was
about
but
at
the
moment
as
if
to
help
her
up
in
the
old
at
the
back
of
the
church
margaret
began
to
sing
everybody
looked
up
in
delight
for
voice
was
the
pride
of
the
family
and
with
reason
somebody
was
at
the
organ
the
little
reed
organ
it
proved
to
be
carolyn
charles
wetmore
for
a
moment
the
notes
rose
harmoniously
then
came
an
interval
and
the
organ
wailed
there
was
a
shout
of
protest
from
the
top
of
guy
cut
it
out
cut
out
the
steam
calliope
unless
you
want
a
burlesque
that
organ
has
been
tuned
since
the
deluge
and
they
did
get
all
the
water
out
then
i
wo
hit
that
key
again
called
carolyn
listen
you
people
listen
you
ca
help
listening
when
a
cat
yowls
on
the
back
fence
retorted
guy
go
it
alone
margaret
girl
but
the
next
instant
nobody
was
jeering
for
margaret
voice
had
never
seemed
sweeter
than
from
the
old
the
hills
of
bethlehem
lighted
by
a
star
wise
men
came
with
offerings
from
the
east
afar
illustration
cut
it
out
cut
out
the
steam
calliope
it
took
them
all
working
until
late
on
christmas
eve
to
do
all
that
needed
to
be
done
once
their
interest
was
aroused
nothing
short
of
the
best
possible
would
content
them
but
when
at
last
nan
and
sam
lingering
behind
the
others
promising
to
see
that
the
fires
were
safe
stood
together
at
the
back
of
the
church
for
a
final
survey
they
felt
that
their
work
had
been
well
worth
while
all
the
lights
were
out
but
one
on
either
side
and
the
dim
interior
with
its
ropes
and
wreaths
of
green
fragrant
with
the
woodsy
smell
which
veiled
the
musty
one
inevitable
in
a
place
so
long
closed
seemed
to
have
grown
beautiful
with
a
touch
other
than
that
of
human
hands
do
you
believe
sammy
questioned
nan
with
her
tired
cheek
against
her
husband
broad
shoulder
the
poor
old
is
happier
than
it
has
been
for
a
long
long
while
i
think
i
should
be
returned
sam
burnett
falling
in
with
his
mood
if
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
cold
starvation
somebody
had
suddenly
warmed
me
and
fed
me
and
made
me
hold
up
my
head
again
it
does
look
pretty
well
much
better
than
i
should
have
thought
it
could
when
i
first
saw
it
in
its
barrenness
i
wonder
what
the
north
estabrook
people
are
thinking
about
this
that
what
i
wonder
do
you
suppose
the
tomlinsons
and
the
pollocks
and
the
rest
of
them
have
talked
about
anything
else
not
much
else
nan
smiled
contentedly
then
suddenly
o
sam
the
presents
are
all
tied
up
we
must
hurry
back
this
is
the
first
christmas
eve
i
can
remember
when
the
rattling
of
tissue
paper
the
chief
sound
on
the
air
if
this
thing
goes
off
all
right
mused
burnett
as
he
examined
the
stoves
once
more
before
putting
out
the
lights
it
be
the
biggest
christmas
present
north
estabrook
ever
had
peace
and
good
will
jove
but
they
need
it
and
so
do
we
all
so
do
we
all
iii
there
go
pretty
near
every
one
of
the
fernalds
down
to
the
station
land
but
there
a
lot
of
counting
the
children
i
suppose
going
to
meet
guy
wife
brother
that
they
got
up
here
to
lead
these
christmas
doings
queer
idea
it
strikes
me
miss
jane
pollock
ensconsed
behind
the
thick
lace
curtains
of
her
best
parlour
addressed
her
sister
who
lay
on
the
couch
in
the
behind
an
invalid
who
could
seldom
get
out
but
to
whom
miss
jane
was
accustomed
faithfully
to
report
every
particle
of
current
news
i
suppose
they
think
miss
jane
went
on
with
asperity
they
going
to
fix
up
the
fuss
in
that
church
with
their
greens
and
their
city
minister
preaching
brotherly
love
i
can
tell
him
he
have
to
preach
a
pretty
powerful
sermon
to
reach
old
george
tomlinson
and
asa
fraser
and
make
notice
each
other
as
they
pass
by
and
when
i
see
maria
hill
coming
toward
me
with
a
smile
on
her
face
and
her
hand
out
i
know
something
happened
i
do
suppose
said
the
invalid
sister
rather
timidly
from
her
couch
you
would
feel
sister
as
if
you
could
put
out
your
hand
to
her
first
no
i
do
retorted
miss
jane
very
positively
and
i
do
see
how
you
can
think
it
deborah
you
know
perfectly
well
it
was
maria
hill
that
started
the
whole
thing
and
then
talked
about
me
as
if
i
was
the
one
how
that
woman
did
talk
and
talks
yet
do
get
me
thinking
about
it
it
christmas
day
and
i
want
to
keep
my
mind
off
such
disgraceful
things
as
church
quarrels
if
the
fernald
family
let
me
a
pretty
bold
thing
to
do
i
call
it
open
up
that
church
on
their
own
responsibility
and
expect
folks
to
come
and
forget
the
past
debby
i
wish
you
could
see
oliver
wife
in
those
furs
of
hers
she
holds
her
head
as
high
as
ever
but
she
the
only
one
of
that
does
it
disagreeably
i
say
that
for
if
they
all
city
folks
now
and
of
course
she
is
a
fernald
here
comes
nancy
and
her
husband
that
girl
do
look
a
minute
when
she
was
married
five
years
ago
my
but
she
got
a
lot
of
style
i
must
say
her
skirts
hang
like
any
north
estabrook
dressmaker
can
make
walking
hurrying
up
to
catch
the
rest
sam
burnett
a
man
but
he
getting
a
little
stout
jane
said
the
invalid
sister
wistfully
i
wish
i
could
go
well
i
wish
you
could
that
is
if
i
go
i
have
just
made
up
my
mind
i
wonder
if
folks
sit
in
their
old
pews
you
know
the
hills
is
just
in
front
of
ours
but
as
to
your
going
deborah
of
course
out
of
the
question
i
suppose
i
shall
go
i
should
like
to
offend
the
fernalds
and
they
do
say
guy
wife
brother
is
worth
hearing
there
to
be
music
too
i
wish
i
could
go
sighed
poor
deborah
under
her
breath
to
be
able
to
go
and
to
wonder
whether
you
will
she
closed
her
patient
eyes
and
whispered
it
them
all
choose
to
go
to
thy
house
this
christmas
day
and
to
thank
thee
that
the
doors
are
open
and
that
they
have
strength
to
go
and
help
me
to
bear
it
to
stay
home
iv
the
problem
is
said
the
reverend
william
sewall
standing
at
the
back
of
the
church
with
his
sister
margaret
and
guy
fernald
her
husband
and
nan
and
sam
burnett
the
four
who
had
as
yet
no
children
and
so
could
best
take
time
on
christmas
afternoon
to
make
the
final
arrangements
for
the
evening
the
problem
is
to
do
the
right
thing
it
would
be
so
mighty
easy
to
do
the
wrong
one
am
i
the
only
man
to
stand
in
that
pulpit
and
is
it
all
up
to
me
he
regarded
the
pulpit
as
he
spoke
richly
hung
with
christmas
greens
and
seeming
eagerly
to
invite
an
occupant
i
should
say
observed
his
guy
his
face
full
of
affection
and
esteem
for
the
very
admirable
figure
of
a
young
man
who
stood
before
him
that
a
fellow
who
just
pulled
off
the
sort
of
service
we
know
you
had
at
john
this
morning
would
consider
this
one
much
of
a
stunt
sewall
smiled
somehow
this
strikes
me
as
the
bigger
one
said
he
the
wisest
of
my
old
professors
used
to
say
that
the
further
you
got
into
the
country
the
less
it
mattered
about
your
clothes
but
the
more
about
your
sermon
i
been
wondering
all
the
way
up
if
i
knew
enough
to
preach
that
sermon
is
there
any
minister
in
town
not
even
a
visiting
one
not
a
one
you
ca
get
out
of
it
billy
sewall
if
you
have
got
an
attack
of
which
we
do
believe
there
one
minister
nan
admitted
but
i
forgotten
all
about
him
till
father
mentioned
him
last
night
but
he
does
really
count
at
all
he
old
very
old
and
infirm
superannuated
they
call
it
added
sam
burnett
poor
old
chap
seen
him
i
met
him
at
the
this
morning
he
has
a
peaceful
face
he
a
good
man
he
must
have
been
a
strong
one
in
his
time
had
he
anything
to
do
with
the
church
trouble
sewall
demanded
his
keen
brown
eyes
eager
nan
and
guy
laughed
old
blake
not
except
as
he
was
on
his
knees
alone
at
home
praying
for
the
fighters
both
sides
was
guy
explanation
so
father
says
and
nobody
knows
better
what
side
people
were
on
if
i
can
get
hold
of
a
man
whose
part
in
the
quarrel
was
praying
for
both
sides
i
off
to
find
him
said
sewall
decidedly
he
picked
up
his
hat
as
he
spoke
tell
me
where
he
lives
please
billy
his
sister
margaret
voice
was
anxious
are
you
sure
better
perhaps
it
would
be
kind
to
ask
him
to
make
a
prayer
but
you
wo
you
wo
ask
him
to
preach
the
sermon
billy
sewall
promise
us
that
cried
guy
an
old
man
in
his
dotage
sewall
smiled
again
starting
toward
the
door
somehow
he
did
not
look
like
the
sort
of
fellow
who
could
be
easily
swayed
from
an
intention
once
he
had
formed
it
or
be
forced
to
make
promises
until
he
was
ready
you
got
me
up
here
said
he
now
you
have
to
take
the
consequences
where
did
you
say
blake
lives
and
he
departed
those
left
behind
stared
at
one
another
in
dismay
keep
cool
advised
sam
burnett
he
wants
the
old
man
advice
all
i
do
blame
him
he
wants
to
understand
the
situation
thoroughly
nothing
like
putting
your
head
into
a
thing
before
you
put
your
foot
in
it
saves
complications
sewall
head
level
trust
him
illustration
billy
his
sister
margaret
voice
was
anxious
are
you
sure
you
better
v
i
ca
said
a
very
old
man
with
a
peaceful
face
now
wearing
a
somewhat
startled
expression
i
ca
quite
believe
you
are
serious
sewall
the
people
are
all
expecting
you
they
will
come
out
to
hear
you
i
have
not
preached
for
he
hesitated
for
many
years
i
will
not
say
that
it
would
not
be
a
happiness
if
i
thought
i
were
fit
but
if
i
were
half
as
fit
answered
sewall
gently
i
should
be
very
proud
but
i
why
i
barely
seasoned
yet
i
liable
to
warp
if
i
exposed
to
the
weather
but
you
with
all
the
benefit
of
your
long
experience
you
the
sort
of
timber
that
needs
to
be
built
into
this
strange
christmas
service
i
had
thought
much
about
it
blake
till
i
was
on
my
way
here
i
accepted
the
invitation
too
readily
but
when
i
did
begin
to
think
i
felt
the
need
of
help
i
believe
you
can
give
it
it
a
critical
situation
you
know
these
people
root
and
branch
i
may
say
the
wrong
thing
you
will
know
how
to
say
the
right
one
if
i
should
consent
the
other
man
said
after
a
silence
during
which
with
bent
white
head
he
studied
the
matter
what
would
be
your
part
should
you
attempt
he
glanced
at
the
clerical
dress
of
his
caller
to
carry
through
the
service
of
your
church
sewall
face
which
had
been
grave
relaxed
no
blake
said
he
it
would
be
possible
and
it
would
be
suitable
this
is
a
community
which
would
probably
prefer
any
other
service
and
it
should
have
its
preference
respected
a
simple
form
as
nearly
as
possible
like
what
it
has
been
used
to
will
be
best
do
you
think
so
i
believe
there
is
to
be
considerable
music
i
will
read
the
story
of
the
birth
and
will
try
to
make
a
prayer
the
rest
i
will
leave
to
you
and
him
added
the
old
man
and
him
agreed
the
young
man
reverently
then
a
bright
smile
broke
over
his
face
and
he
held
out
his
hand
i
no
end
grateful
to
you
sir
he
said
a
certain
attractive
boyishness
of
manner
suddenly
coming
uppermost
and
putting
to
flight
the
dignity
which
was
at
times
a
heavier
weight
than
he
could
carry
no
end
do
you
remember
how
it
used
to
be
when
you
first
went
into
the
work
and
tackled
a
job
now
and
then
that
seemed
too
big
for
you
then
you
caught
sight
of
a
pair
of
shoulders
that
looked
to
you
broader
than
yours
the
muscles
developed
by
years
of
exercise
and
you
were
pretty
thankful
to
shift
the
load
on
to
them
you
did
want
to
shirk
heaven
forbid
but
you
just
felt
you
did
know
enough
to
deal
with
the
situation
do
you
remember
the
old
man
with
a
gently
humorous
look
glanced
down
at
his
own
thin
bent
shoulders
then
at
the
stalwart
ones
which
towered
above
him
you
speak
metaphorically
my
dear
lad
he
said
quaintly
with
a
kindly
twinkle
in
his
faded
blue
eyes
he
laid
his
left
hand
on
the
firm
young
arm
whose
hand
held
his
shrunken
right
but
i
do
remember
yes
yes
i
remember
plainly
enough
and
though
it
seems
to
me
now
as
if
the
strength
were
all
with
the
young
and
vigorous
in
body
it
may
be
that
i
should
be
glad
of
the
years
that
have
brought
me
experience
and
tolerance
added
william
sewall
pressing
the
hand
his
eyes
held
fast
by
elder
blake
and
love
yet
added
the
other
love
that
the
great
thing
the
great
thing
i
do
love
this
community
these
dear
people
they
are
good
people
at
heart
only
misled
as
to
what
is
worth
standing
out
for
i
would
see
them
at
peace
maybe
i
can
speak
to
them
god
knows
i
will
try
vi
the
fernald
family
alone
will
fill
the
church
observed
the
bachelor
son
of
the
house
ralph
he
leaned
out
from
his
place
at
the
tail
of
the
procession
to
look
ahead
down
the
line
where
the
dark
figures
showed
clearly
against
the
snow
by
either
hand
he
held
a
child
his
sister
carolyn
oldest
his
brother
edson
youngest
so
it
wo
matter
much
if
nobody
else
comes
out
we
all
here
in
rags
and
some
in
tags
and
some
in
velvet
gowns
i
can
discern
the
velvet
gowns
conceded
edson
from
his
place
just
in
front
where
his
substantial
figure
supported
his
mother
frail
one
but
i
fail
to
make
out
any
rags
take
us
by
and
large
we
seem
to
put
up
rather
a
prosperous
front
i
never
noticed
it
quite
so
decidedly
as
this
year
there
nothing
at
all
ostentatious
about
the
girls
dressing
dear
said
his
mother
voice
in
his
ear
and
i
noticed
they
all
put
on
their
simplest
clothes
for
as
they
should
oh
yes
edson
chuckled
that
precisely
why
they
look
so
prosperous
that
elegant
simplicity
gad
you
should
see
the
bills
that
come
in
for
it
jess
is
an
extravagant
dresser
as
women
go
not
by
a
long
shot
he
whistled
a
bar
or
two
of
ragtime
i
can
see
myself
now
as
a
lad
sitting
on
that
fence
over
there
he
indicated
a
line
of
rails
half
buried
in
snow
which
outlined
the
borders
of
an
old
apple
orchard
counting
the
quarters
in
my
trousers
pockets
earned
by
hard
labour
in
the
strawberry
patch
i
thought
it
quite
a
sum
but
it
would
have
bought
a
box
of
the
cigars
you
smoke
now
interjected
ralph
unexpectedly
from
behind
hullo
there
the
church
jolly
but
the
old
building
looks
bright
does
it
i
did
know
oil
lamps
could
put
up
such
an
illumination
and
see
the
folks
going
in
see
them
coming
from
all
directions
nan
farther
down
the
line
clutched
sam
burnett
arm
oh
i
knew
they
come
out
i
knew
they
would
of
course
they
come
out
this
was
oliver
locks
and
bars
could
keep
a
country
community
at
home
when
there
is
anything
going
on
but
as
to
the
that
is
a
different
matter
oliver
do
take
my
muff
i
want
to
take
off
my
veil
there
will
be
no
chance
once
i
am
inside
the
door
nan
is
walking
twice
as
fast
now
as
when
we
started
she
will
have
us
all
up
the
aisle
before
where
billy
sewall
bolting
to
guy
sent
back
this
from
the
front
of
the
procession
to
margaret
his
wife
who
was
walking
with
father
fernald
her
hand
on
his
gallant
arm
in
john
fernald
day
a
man
always
offered
his
arm
to
the
lady
he
escorted
he
caught
sight
of
blake
across
the
road
they
going
in
together
margaret
replied
i
think
blake
is
to
have
a
part
in
the
service
old
ebenezer
blake
you
do
say
father
fernald
ejaculated
in
astonishment
he
had
not
been
told
of
sewall
visit
to
the
aged
minister
well
well
that
is
thoughtful
of
william
sewall
i
do
suppose
elder
blake
has
taken
part
in
a
service
in
fifteen
years
twenty
maybe
he
used
to
be
a
great
preacher
too
in
his
day
i
used
to
listen
to
him
when
i
was
a
young
man
and
think
he
could
put
things
in
about
as
interesting
a
way
as
any
preacher
i
ever
heard
good
man
too
he
was
and
is
but
nobody
thought
of
asking
him
to
make
a
prayer
in
public
since
i
do
know
when
well
well
look
at
the
people
going
in
i
guess
we
better
be
getting
right
along
to
our
seats
or
there
wo
be
any
left
vii
the
organ
was
playing
very
softly
carolyn
was
a
skilful
manipulator
of
keyboards
and
she
had
discovered
that
by
carefully
refraining
from
the
use
of
certain
keys
discreetly
marked
by
postage
stamps
she
could
produce
a
not
unmusical
effect
of
subdued
harmony
this
unquestionably
added
very
much
to
the
impression
of
a
churchly
atmosphere
carried
out
to
the
eye
by
the
christmas
wreathing
and
twining
of
the
heavy
ropes
of
shining
laurel
leaves
and
by
the
massing
of
the
whole
in
the
soft
dark
green
of
hemlock
boughs
and
holly
to
the
people
who
entered
the
house
with
vivid
memories
of
the
burning
july
day
when
words
hardly
less
burning
had
seemed
to
scorch
the
barren
walls
this
interior
clothed
with
the
garments
of
the
woods
and
fragrant
with
their
breath
seemed
a
place
so
different
that
it
could
hardly
be
the
same
but
the
faces
were
the
same
the
faces
and
george
tomlinson
did
not
look
at
asa
fraser
though
he
passed
him
in
the
aisle
beard
to
beard
miss
jane
pollock
stared
hard
at
the
back
of
maria
hill
bonnet
in
the
pew
in
front
of
her
but
when
hill
turned
about
to
glance
up
at
the
to
discover
who
was
there
miss
pollock
face
became
as
adamant
and
her
eyes
remained
fixed
on
her
folded
hands
until
hill
had
twisted
about
again
and
there
was
no
danger
of
their
glances
encountering
all
over
the
church
likewise
were
people
who
avoided
seeing
each
other
though
conscious
all
down
their
rigid
backbones
that
those
with
whom
they
had
fallen
out
on
that
unhappy
july
day
were
present
there
was
no
vestry
in
the
old
no
retiring
place
of
any
sort
where
the
presiding
minister
might
stay
until
the
moment
came
for
him
to
make
his
quiet
and
impressive
entrance
through
a
softly
opening
pulpit
door
so
when
the
reverend
william
sewall
of
john
of
the
neighbouring
city
came
into
the
north
estabrook
sanctuary
it
was
as
his
congregation
had
entered
through
the
front
door
and
up
the
aisle
there
was
a
turning
of
heads
to
see
him
come
but
there
was
a
staring
of
eyes
indeed
when
it
was
seen
by
whom
he
was
accompanied
the
erect
figure
of
the
young
man
in
his
unexceptionable
attire
walked
slowly
to
keep
pace
with
the
feeble
footsteps
of
the
very
old
man
in
his
threadbare
garments
of
the
cut
of
half
a
century
ago
and
the
sight
of
the
two
together
was
one
of
the
most
strangely
touching
things
that
had
ever
met
the
eyes
of
the
people
of
north
estabrook
it
may
be
said
therefore
that
from
that
first
moment
there
was
an
unexpected
and
influence
abroad
in
the
place
now
to
the
subdued
notes
of
the
organ
which
had
been
occupied
with
one
theme
built
upon
with
varying
harmonies
but
ever
appearing
though
perhaps
no
ear
but
a
trained
one
would
have
recognized
it
through
the
veil
was
added
the
breath
of
voices
it
was
only
an
old
christmas
carol
the
music
that
of
a
german
folk
song
but
dear
to
generations
of
christmas
singers
everywhere
the
north
estabrook
people
recognized
it
yet
did
not
recognize
it
they
had
never
heard
it
sung
like
that
before
night
peaceful
night
all
is
dark
save
the
light
yonder
where
they
sweet
vigils
keep
the
babe
who
in
silent
sleep
rests
in
heavenly
it
was
the
presence
of
margaret
sewall
fernald
which
had
made
it
possible
to
attempt
music
at
this
service
the
music
which
it
seemed
impossible
to
do
without
her
voice
was
one
of
rare
beauty
her
leadership
that
of
training
her
husband
guy
possessed
a
reliable
if
uncultivated
bass
edson
had
sung
a
fair
tenor
in
his
college
by
the
use
of
all
her
arts
of
persuasion
nan
had
provided
an
alto
singer
from
the
ranks
of
the
choir
which
had
once
occupied
this
the
daughter
of
asa
fraser
whether
the
quartette
thus
formed
would
have
passed
muster
as
a
quartette
with
the
of
john
may
have
been
a
question
but
it
is
certain
the
music
they
produced
was
so
far
above
that
which
the
old
church
had
ever
heard
before
within
its
walls
that
had
the
singers
been
a
detachment
from
the
choir
celestial
those
who
heard
them
could
hardly
have
listened
with
ears
more
charmed
as
holy
night
came
down
to
him
william
sewall
bent
his
head
but
ebenezer
blake
lifted
his
his
dim
blue
eyes
looked
up
up
and
up
quite
through
the
old
roof
to
the
starry
skies
where
it
seemed
to
him
angels
sang
again
he
forgot
the
people
assembled
in
front
of
him
he
forgot
the
responsibilities
upon
his
shoulders
those
bent
shoulders
which
had
long
ago
laid
down
such
responsibilities
he
saw
visions
it
is
the
old
men
who
see
visions
the
young
men
dream
dreams
the
young
city
rector
read
the
christmas
story
out
of
the
worn
copy
of
the
scriptures
which
had
served
this
pulpit
almost
from
the
beginning
he
read
it
in
the
rich
and
cultivated
voice
of
his
training
but
quite
simply
then
margaret
sang
to
the
slender
accompaniment
of
the
little
organ
the
same
solo
which
a
famous
soprano
had
sung
that
morning
at
the
service
at
john
and
her
brother
william
listening
from
the
pulpit
thought
she
sang
it
better
there
was
the
quality
in
voice
which
reaches
hearts
a
quality
which
somehow
the
famous
notes
had
lacked
and
every
word
could
be
heard
too
the
quiet
throughout
the
house
was
so
absolute
except
when
asa
fraser
cleared
his
throat
loudly
in
the
midst
of
one
of
the
singer
most
beautiful
notes
at
the
sound
george
tomlinson
gave
him
a
glance
which
ought
to
have
annihilated
him
but
it
did
not
she
could
not
know
that
the
was
a
high
tribute
to
the
song
coming
from
asa
fraser
silently
how
silently
the
wondrous
gift
is
given
so
god
imparts
to
human
hearts
the
blessing
of
his
heaven
o
holy
child
of
bethlehem
descend
to
us
we
pray
cast
out
our
sin
and
enter
in
be
born
in
us
then
william
sewall
made
a
prayer
those
who
had
been
looking
to
see
old
elder
blake
take
this
part
in
the
service
began
to
wonder
if
he
had
been
asked
into
the
pulpit
simply
as
a
courtesy
they
supposed
he
could
pray
at
least
they
knew
he
had
never
ceased
doing
it
and
for
them
elder
blake
had
not
an
enemy
in
the
village
it
seemed
strange
that
he
could
be
given
some
part
in
spite
of
his
extreme
age
to
be
sure
it
was
many
years
since
anybody
had
asked
him
to
take
part
in
any
service
whatsoever
even
a
funeral
service
for
which
as
is
well
understood
a
man
retains
efficiency
long
after
he
has
ceased
to
be
of
use
in
the
pulpit
no
matter
how
devastating
may
be
the
weather
but
that
fact
did
not
seem
to
bear
upon
the
present
situation
a
number
of
people
among
them
miss
jane
pollock
were
beginning
to
feel
more
than
a
little
indignant
about
it
and
so
lost
the
most
of
prayer
which
was
a
good
one
and
not
out
of
the
though
there
were
phrases
in
it
which
suggested
that
source
as
was
quite
natural
the
city
man
meant
to
do
it
all
then
doubtless
he
thought
nobody
from
the
country
knew
how
to
do
more
than
to
pronounce
the
benediction
doubtless
that
was
to
be
elder
blake
insignificant
part
to
pronounce
the
miss
jane
pollock
looked
up
quickly
she
had
been
staring
steadily
at
the
back
of
maria
hill
mink
collar
in
front
of
her
through
the
closing
sentences
of
the
prayer
but
what
was
this
elder
blake
had
risen
and
was
coming
forward
was
he
going
to
read
a
hymn
but
he
had
no
book
and
he
had
taken
off
his
spectacles
he
could
see
better
as
was
known
without
his
spectacles
when
looking
at
a
distance
william
sewall
prayer
was
not
ended
he
could
no
longer
be
heard
by
the
people
but
in
his
seat
behind
the
drooping
figure
of
the
old
man
he
was
asking
things
of
the
lord
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
never
asked
anything
before
could
his
poor
feeble
superannuated
old
servant
ever
speak
the
message
that
needed
to
be
spoken
that
night
william
sewall
felt
more
than
ever
that
he
himself
could
not
have
done
it
could
ebenezer
blake
him
strong
o
god
make
him
requested
william
sewall
fervently
then
forgetting
even
a
likeness
to
phrase
he
added
with
fists
unconsciously
in
the
language
of
the
athletic
field
where
a
few
years
back
he
himself
had
taken
part
in
many
a
battle
him
to
buck
up
viii
they
talk
about
it
yet
in
north
estabrook
though
it
happened
a
year
ago
nobody
knew
how
it
was
that
from
a
frail
old
man
with
a
trembling
voice
which
in
its
first
sentences
the
people
back
of
the
middle
of
the
church
could
hardly
hear
there
came
to
stand
before
them
a
fiery
messenger
from
the
skies
but
such
was
the
miracle
for
it
seemed
no
less
the
bent
figure
straightened
the
trembling
voice
grew
clear
and
strong
the
dim
eyes
brightened
into
the
withered
cheeks
flowed
colour
into
the
whole
aged
personality
came
slowly
but
surely
back
the
fires
of
youth
and
once
more
in
a
public
place
ebenezer
blake
became
the
mouthpiece
of
the
master
he
served
illustration
there
was
flesh
and
blood
in
the
message
he
gave
them
and
it
was
the
message
they
needed
peace
and
good
will
oh
yes
he
preached
it
no
doubt
of
that
but
it
was
no
peace
no
good
will
there
was
flesh
and
blood
in
the
message
he
gave
them
and
it
was
the
message
they
needed
even
his
text
was
not
the
gentle
part
of
the
christmas
prophecy
it
was
the
militant
part
the
government
shall
be
upon
his
they
were
not
bidden
to
lie
down
together
like
lambs
they
were
summoned
to
march
together
like
lions
the
lions
of
the
lord
as
william
sewall
looked
down
into
the
faces
of
the
people
and
watched
the
changing
expressions
there
he
felt
that
the
strange
strong
challenging
words
were
going
home
he
saw
stooping
shoulders
straighten
even
as
the
preacher
had
straightened
he
saw
heads
come
up
and
eyes
grow
light
most
of
all
he
saw
that
at
last
the
people
had
forgotten
one
another
and
were
remembering
god
suddenly
the
sermon
ended
as
preachers
of
a
later
day
have
learned
the
art
of
stopping
abruptly
with
a
striking
climax
so
this
preacher
from
an
earlier
generation
his
message
delivered
ceased
to
speak
he
left
his
hearers
breathless
but
after
a
moment
pause
during
which
the
silence
was
a
thing
to
be
felt
the
voice
spoke
again
it
no
longer
rang
it
sank
into
a
low
pleading
in
words
out
of
the
book
upon
which
the
clasped
old
hands
rested
therefore
o
our
god
hear
the
prayer
of
thy
servant
and
his
supplications
and
cause
thy
face
to
shine
upon
thy
sanctuary
that
is
desolate
for
the
lord

in
the
chokily

to
margaret

with
night

nothing
else
seems
to
fit
after
that
she
nodded
her
eyes
wet
it
had
not
been
thought
best
to
ask
the
congregation
to
sing
there
was
no
knowing
whether
anybody
would
sing
if
they
were
asked
now
it
seemed
fortunate
that
it
had
been
so
arranged
for
somehow
the
congregation
did
not
look
exactly
as
if
it
could
sing
certainly
not
george
tomlinson
for
he
had
a
large
frog
in
his
throat
not
asa
fraser
for
he
had
a
furious
cold
in
his
head
not
maria
hill
for
though
she
hunted
vigorously
high
and
low
for
her
handkerchief
she
was
unable
to
locate
it
and
the
front
of
her
best
black
silk
was
rapidly
becoming
shiny
in
spots
a
fact
calculated
to
upset
singing
not
even
miss
jane
pollock
for
though
no
tears
bedewed
her
bright
black
eyes
there
was
a
peculiar
heaving
quality
in
her
breathing
which
suggested
an
impediment
of
some
sort
not
to
be
readily
overcome
and
it
may
be
safely
said
that
there
was
not
a
baker
dozen
of
people
left
in
the
church
who
could
have
carried
through
the
most
familiar
hymn
without
breaking
down
so
the
four
in
the
organ
loft
sang
holy
night
again
they
could
not
have
done
a
better
thing
it
is
a
holy
night
indeed
when
a
messenger
from
heaven
comes
down
to
this
world
of
ours
though
he
take
the
form
of
an
old
old
man
with
a
peaceful
face
but
with
eyes
which
can
flash
once
more
with
a
light
which
is
not
of
earth
and
with
lips
upon
which
for
one
last
mighty
effort
has
been
laid
a
coal
from
off
the

the
great
high

george
tomlinson
came
heavily
out
of
his
pew
he
had
at
last
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
the
frog
in
his
throat
or
thought
he
had
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
perhaps
he
ought
to
go
up
and
speak
to
elder
blake
now
sitting
quietly
in
his
chair
with
william
sewall
bending
over
him
though
he
did
know
exactly
what
to
say
that
would
seem
adequate
to
the
occasion
at
the
same
moment
asa
fraser
still
struggling
with
the
cold
in
his
head
emerged
from
his
pew
directly
opposite
the
two
men
did
not
look
at
each
other
but
as
they
had
been
accustomed
to
allow
their
meeting
glances
to
clash
with
the
cutting
quality
of
implacable
resentment
this
dropping
of
the
eyes
on
the
part
of
each
might
have
been
interpreted
to
register
a
distinct
advance
toward
peace
as
each
stood
momentarily
at
the
opening
of
his
pew
neither
quite
determined
whether
to
turn
his
face
or
samuel
burnett
coming
eagerly
up
to
them
from
the
side
laid
a
friendly
hand
on
either
arm
whether
sam
was
inspired
by
heaven
or
only
by
his
own
strong
and
knowledge
of
men
will
never
be
known
but
he
had
been
a
popular
man
in
north
estabrook
ever
since
he
had
first
begun
to
come
there
to
see
nancy
fernald
and
both
tomlinson
and
fraser
heartily
liked
and
respected
him
a
fact
he
understood
and
was
counting
on
now
was
it
great
mr
tomlinson
said
sam
enthusiastically
great
mr
fraser
he
looked
smiling
into
first
one
austere
face
and
then
the
other

he
gazed
straight
ahead

him
up
at
elder

going
up
to
tell
him

pressed
the

arms
continuing
in
his
friendly
way
to
retain
his
hold
on
both
in
all
the
years
gone
to
church
i
never
heard
preaching
like
that
it
warmed
up
my
heart
till
i
thought
it
would
burst
and
it
made
me
want
to
go
to
work
almost
without
their
own
volition
tomlinson
and
fraser
found
themselves
proceeding
toward
the
pulpit
yet
sam
hands
did
not
seem
to
be
exerting
any
force
the
force
came
from
his
own
vigorous
personality
which
was
one
that
invariably
inspired
confidence
if
burnett
was
going
up
to
speak
to
the
elder
it
seemed
only
proper
that
they
the
leading
men
of
the
church
should
go
too
william
sewall
having
assured
himself
that
his
venerable
associate
was
not
suffering
from
a
more
than
natural
exhaustion
after
his
supreme
effort
stood
still
by
his
side
looking
out
over
the
congregation
he
now
observed
an
interesting
trio
approaching
the
platform
composed
of
his
valued
friend
samuel
burnett
his
fine
face
alight
with
his
purpose
and
two
men
of
somewhat
unpromising
exterior
but
plainly
of
prominence
in
the
church
by
the
indefinable
look
of
them
he
watched
the
three
climb
the
pulpit
stairs
and
come
up
to
the
figure
in
the
chair
sam
with
tact
falling
behind
you
did
well
elder
you
did
well
said
george
tomlinson
struggling
to
express
himself
and
finding
only
this
phrase
he
stood
awkwardly
on
one
foot
before
ebenezer
blake
like
an
embarrassed
schoolboy
but
his
tone
was
sincere
and
a
trifle
husky
on
account
of
the
untimely
reappearance
of
the
frog
in
his
throat
elder
blake
looked
up
and
william
sewall
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
sweeter
smile
on
a
human
face
young
or
old
you
are
kind
to
come
and
tell
me
so
george
said
he
i
had
thought
never
to
preach
again
it
did
me
good
it
did
us
good
sir
said
sam
burnett
he
had
waited
an
instant
for
fraser
to
speak
but
saw
that
the
cold
in
the
head
was
in
the
ascendancy
again
it
did
me
so
much
good
that
i
can
hardly
wait
till
i
get
back
to
town
to
hunt
up
a
man
i
know
and
tell
him
i
think
he
was
in
the
right
in
a
little
disagreement
we
had
a
good
while
ago
i
always
been
positive
he
was
wrong
i
suppose
the
facts
in
the
case
changed
he
smiled
into
the
dim
blue
eyes
but
somehow
i
seem
to
see
them
differently
it
does
look
to
me
worth
while
to
let
them
stand
between
us
any
longer
ah
it
not
worth
while
agreed
the
old
man
quickly
it
not
worth
while
for
any
of
us
to
be
hard
on
one
another
no
matter
what
the
facts
life
is
pretty
difficult
at
its
best
we
ca
afford
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
any
human
soul
go
back
to
town
and
make
it
right
with
your
friend
burnett
i
take
it
he
was
your
friend
or
you
think
of
him
was
and
is
declared
sam
with
conviction
he
got
to
be
whether
he
wants
to
or
not
but
he
want
to
i
know
that
well
enough
been
friends
from
boyhood
we
just
forgotten
it
that
all
there
was
a
little
pause
the
old
man
sat
with
his
white
head
leaning
against
the
high
back
of
his
chair
his
face
upturned
his
eyes
with
an
appeal
in
them
resting
first
upon
the
face
of
asa
fraser
then
upon
that
of
george
tomlinson
with
a
common
impulse
william
sewall
and
samuel
burnett
moved
aside
together
turning
their
backs
upon
the
three
asa
fraser
lifted
his
eyes
and
met
those
of
george
tomlinson
with
a
palpable
effort
for
he
was
a
man
of
few
words
he
spoke
george
said
he
i
guess
i
made
a
mistake
thinking
as
i
did
asey
responded
tomlinson
quickly
i
guess
you
were
the
only
one
that
made
a
mistake
and
he
held
out
his
hand
fraser
grasped
it
with
his
other
hand
he
raised
his
handkerchief
and
blew
his
nose
once
more
violently
and
finally
from
this
point
the
smile
in
his
eyes
usurped
the
place
of
the
moisture
which
had
bothered
him
so
unwontedly
and
put
it
quite
to
rout
if
you
imagine
that
this
little
drama
had
escaped
the
attention
of
the
departing
congregation
headed
the
other
way
you
are
much
mistaken
the
congregation
was
not
headed
the
other
way
from
the
moment
when
burnett
fraser
and
tomlinson
had
started
toward
the
pulpit
the
congregation
to
a
man
had
paused
and
was
staring
directly
toward
them
it
continued
to
stare
up
to
the
moment
when
the
handshaking
took
place
but
then
eyes
turned
and
met
other
eyes
hearts
beat
fast
lips
trembled
feet
moved
unquestionably
something
had
happened
to
the
people
of
north
estabrook
do
you
know
how
sometimes
the
ice
goes
out
of
a
river
from
shore
to
shore
it
has
been
frozen
cold
and
hard
for
many
months
it
has
grown
solid
deepening
and
thickening
until
it
seems
as
if
there
could
be
no
life
left
beneath
then
at
last
comes
sunshine
and
rain
and
warmth
the
huge
mass
looks
as
impenetrable
as
ever
but
all
at
once
some
day
crack
the
first
thin
dark
line
spreads
across
the
surface
then
crack
crack
in
every
direction
the
ice
is
breaking
up
look
quickly
now
if
you
would
see
that
frozen
surface
stretching
seamless
between
shore
and
shore
for
suddenly
dark
lanes
of
water
open
up
which
widen
while
you
watch
and
soon
incredibly
soon
the
river
has
burst
its
bonds
and
is
rushing
freely
once
more
between
its
banks
with
only
the
blocks
of
melting
ice
upon
its
surface
to
tell
the
story
of
its
long
imprisonment
even
so
on
that
memorable
christmas
night
did
the
ice
in
the
north
estabrook
church
break
up
george
tomlinson
and
asa
fraser
old
friends
but
sworn
foes
had
shaken
hands
tomlinson
and
fraser
tears
running
frankly
down
their
cheeks
had
followed
the
example
of
their
husbands
and
glad
enough
to
do
it
for
their
homes
lay
side
by
side
and
each
had
had
a
hard
time
of
it
getting
along
without
the
other
miss
jane
pollock
seeing
maria
hill
fruitless
search
for
her
handkerchief
had
long
since
drawn
out
one
of
her
own
she
always
carried
two
and
had
held
it
in
her
hand
ready
to
offer
it
if
she
could
just
get
to
the
point
but
when
she
saw
upon
the
pulpit
platform
those
two
gripping
hands
somehow
she
suddenly
reached
the
point
with
no
difficulty
whatever
miss
pollock
slipped
the
handkerchief
into
hill
hand
whispering
commiseratingly
i
presume
you
got
one
somewhere
maria
but
you
just
ca
lay
your
hand
on
it
do
take
the
trouble
to
return
it
it
is
of
any
value
and
hill
accepting
the
handkerchief
wiped
away
the
unmanageable
tears
and
turning
round
answered
fervently
i
guess
i
return
it
jane
if
it
only
so
to
come
to
your
house
again
if
you
let
me
in
after
all
i
said
even
as
they
smiled
shamefacedly
but
happily
at
each
other
similar
scenes
were
being
enacted
all
about
them
spread
the
breaking
ice
incredible
that
it
should
happen
in
a
night
not
so
the
forces
of
nature
are
mighty
but
they
are
as
weakness
beside
the
spiritual
forces
of
nature
god
xi
well
billy
sewall
have
you
taken
your
young
friend
home
and
put
him
to
bed
the
questioner
was
ralph
fernald
sitting
with
the
rest
of
the
family
or
those
members
of
it
who
were
not
still
attending
to
the
wants
of
little
children
before
the
fireplace
talking
things
over
they
had
been
there
for
nearly
an
hour
since
the
service
but
sewall
had
only
just
come
in
i
taken
him
home
sewall
replied
but
there
was
no
putting
him
to
bed
i
think
he
sit
up
till
morning
too
happy
to
sleep
the
fine
old
man
they
had
saved
the
big
armchair
for
him
in
the
very
centre
of
the
circle
but
he
would
have
none
of
it
he
went
over
to
a
corner
of
the
inglenook
and
dropped
upon
the
floor
at
his
sister
margaret
feet
with
his
arm
upon
her
knee
when
somebody
protested
guy
interfered
in
his
defence
let
him
alone
said
he
he
gets
enough
of
prominent
positions
if
he
wants
to
sit
on
the
fence
and
kick
his
heels
a
while
let
him
he
certainly
earned
the
right
to
do
as
he
pleases
by
george
talk
about
magnificent
if
ever
i
saw
a
sacrifice
play
i
saw
it
sewall
shook
his
head
you
may
have
seen
said
he
though
blake
was
the
most
of
the
team
but
there
was
no
sacrifice
play
on
my
part
it
was
simply
a
matter
of
passing
the
ball
to
the
man
who
could
run
i
should
have
been
down
in
four
yards
if
i
ever
got
away
at
all
john
fernald
looked
at
his
wife
with
a
puzzled
smile
what
sort
o
talk
is
that
he
queried
then
he
went
on
i
suppose
you
boys
are
giving
the
credit
to
elder
blake
who
ought
to
have
it
but
i
give
a
good
deal
to
william
sewall
whose
eyes
were
sharp
enough
to
see
what
we
been
too
blind
to
find
out
that
the
old
man
was
the
one
who
could
deal
with
us
and
make
us
see
light
on
our
quarrel
he
did
make
us
see
it
here
i
been
standing
off
pluming
myself
on
being
too
wise
to
mix
up
in
the
fuss
when
i
ought
to
have
been
doing
my
best
to
bring
folks
together
what
a
difference
it
does
make
the
way
you
see
a
thing
he
looked
round
upon
the
group
scanning
one
stirred
face
after
another
as
the
ruddy
firelight
illumined
them
his
glance
finally
rested
on
his
daughter
nan
she
too
sat
upon
the
floor
on
a
plump
red
cushion
with
her
back
against
her
husband
knee
somehow
nan
and
sam
were
never
far
apart
at
times
like
these
the
youngest
of
the
house
of
fernald
had
made
perhaps
the
happiest
marriage
of
them
all
and
the
knowledge
of
this
gave
her
father
and
mother
great
satisfaction
the
sight
of
the
pair
returning
his
scrutiny
with
bright
faces
gave
john
fernald
his
next
comment
after
the
preachers
i
guess
nancy
and
samuel
deserve
about
the
most
credit
he
went
on
it
was
the
little
girl
idea
and
sam
stood
by
her
right
through
he
began
to
chuckle
i
can
see
sam
now
towing
those
two
old
fellows
up
to
the
pulpit
i
do
believe
they
ever
have
got
there
without
him
there
certainly
is
a
time
when
a
man
hand
on
your
arm
makes
it
a
good
deal
easier
to
go
where
you
know
you
ought
to
go
it
would
have
taken
more
than
my
hand
to
tow
them
away
said
sam
burnett
after
they
found
out
how
it
felt
to
be
friends
again
nobody
could
come
between
them
now
with
an
axe
the
music
helped
cried
nan
the
music
helped
more
than
anything
except
the
sermon
think
how
margaret
worked
over
that
and
carolyn
over
that
crazy
little
old
organ
and
guy
and
ed
and
charles
hung
all
those
greens
i
tacked
the
pulpit
put
in
oliver
gravely
while
you
assigning
credit
do
forget
that
i
stoked
those
stoves
asserted
ralph
that
one
christopher
i
never
saw
a
stove
like
that
to
hand
out
smoke
in
your
face
but
the
church
was
warm
when
i
got
through
with
you
all
did
wonderfully
well
came
mother
fernald
proud
and
happy
declaration
all
but
me
said
a
voice
from
the
centre
of
the
group
it
was
a
voice
which
nobody
had
ever
expected
to
hear
in
an
acknowledgment
of
failure
of
any
sort
whatsoever
and
all
ears
listened
in
amazement
i
did
nothing
but
discourage
everybody
went
on
the
voice
not
quite
evenly
i
believe
i
apt
to
do
that
though
i
never
realized
it
before
but
when
that
wonderful
old
man
was
speaking
it
came
to
me
quite
suddenly
that
the
reason
my
husband
family
do
like
me
better
is
because
it
is
my
nature
always
to
see
the
objections
to
a
thing
and
to
discourage
people
about
it
if
i
can
i
want
to
tell
you
all
that
i
going
to
try
to
help
not
hinder
from
now
on
there
was
never
a
deeper
sincerity
than
breathed
in
these
astonishing
words
from
marian
oliver
wife
astonishing
because
they
all
understood
knowing
her
as
they
did
oliver
was
oldest
and
had
been
first
to
marry
what
a
tremendous
effort
the
little
speech
had
cost
her
a
proud
woman
of
the
world
who
had
never
seemed
to
care
whether
her
husband
family
loved
her
or
not
so
that
they
deferred
to
her
for
a
moment
they
were
all
too
surprised
and
touched
for
there
is
nothing
more
touching
than
humility
where
it
is
least
expected
to
speak
then
ralph
who
sat
next
marian
brought
his
fist
down
on
his
knee
with
a
thud
bully
for
you
said
he
upon
marian
other
side
her
husband
mother
slipped
a
warm
delicate
hand
into
hers
nan
leaning
past
sam
knee
reached
up
and
patted
her
lap
everybody
else
smiled
in
his
or
her
most
friendly
way
at
oliver
wife
and
oliver
himself
though
he
said
nothing
and
merely
continued
to
stare
fixedly
into
the
fire
looked
as
if
he
would
be
willing
to
tack
pulpit
for
a
living
if
it
would
help
to
bring
about
such
results
as
these
marian
right
in
calling
him
a
old
man
guy
spoke
thoughtfully
he
got
us
all
fernalds
as
well
as
tomlinsons
and
frasers
he
hit
me
square
between
the
eyes
good
and
hard
but
glad
he
did
he
owned
with
characteristic
frankness
they
all
sat
gazing
into
the
fire
in
silence
for
a
little
after
that
in
the
musing
way
of
those
who
have
much
to
think
about
and
by
and
by
father
fernald
pulled
out
his
watch
and
scanned
it
by
the
wavering
light
bless
my
soul
he
cried
it
close
on
to
twelve
you
children
ought
to
be
in
bed
ought
they
mother
there
was
a
murmur
of
laughter
round
the
group
for
john
fernald
was
looking
at
his
wife
over
his
spectacles
in
just
the
quizzical
way
his
sons
and
daughters
well
remembered
i
suppose
they
ought
john
she
responded
smiling
at
him
but
you
might
let
them
sit
up
a
little
longer
just
this
once
he
looked
them
over
once
more
it
was
the
hundredth
time
his
eyes
had
gone
round
the
circle
that
night
it
was
a
goodly
array
of
manhood
and
womanhood
for
a
father
to
look
at
and
call
his
own
even
william
sewall
the
brother
of
his
son
wife
seemed
to
belong
to
him
they
gave
him
back
his
proud
and
tender
glance
every
one
of
them
and
his
heart
was
very
full
as
for
their
mother
but
her
eyes
had
gone
down
well
he
said
leaning
over
to
clasp
her
hand
in
his
own
as
she
sat
next
him
i
guess
maybe
just
this
once
it
wo
do
any
harm
to
let
stay
up
a
little
late
