he
studied
medicine
in
guadalajara
and
returned
to
lagos
in
where
he
began
the
practice
of
his
profession
he
began
his
writing
career
early
in
he
published
impressions
of
a
student
in
a
weekly
of
mexico
city
this
was
followed
by
numerous
sketches
and
short
stories
and
in
by
his
first
novel
andres
perez
maderista
like
most
of
the
young
liberals
he
supported
francisco
uprising
which
overthrew
the
dictatorship
of
porfirio
diaz
and
in
was
made
director
of
education
of
the
state
of
jalisco
after
madero
assassination
he
joined
the
army
of
pancho
villa
as
doctor
and
his
knowledge
of
the
revolution
was
acquired
at
firsthand
when
the
counterrevolutionary
forces
of
victoriano
huerta
were
temporarily
triumphant
he
emigrated
to
el
paso
texas
where
in
he
wrote
the
underdogs
los
de
abajo
which
did
not
receive
general
recognition
until
when
it
was
hailed
as
the
novel
of
the
revolution
but
azuela
was
fundamentally
a
moralist
and
his
disappointment
with
the
revolution
soon
began
to
manifest
itself
he
had
fought
for
a
better
mexico
but
he
saw
that
while
the
revolution
had
corrected
certain
injustices
it
had
given
rise
to
others
equally
deplorable
when
he
saw
the
and
the
unprincipled
turning
his
hopes
for
the
redemption
of
the
of
his
country
into
a
ladder
to
serve
their
own
ends
his
disillusionment
was
deep
and
often
bitter
his
later
novels
are
marred
at
times
by
a
savage
sarcasm
during
his
later
years
and
until
his
death
in
he
lived
in
mexico
city
writing
and
practicing
his
profession
among
the
poor

with
deep
feeling
i
that
no
animal
i
tell
you

to
the
dog
barking
it
must
be
a
human
being
the
woman
stared
into
the
darkness
of
the
sierra
what
if
they
soldiers
said
a
man
who
sat
eating
a
coarse
earthenware
plate
in
his
right
hand
three
folded
tortillas
in
the
other
the
woman
made
no
answer
all
her
senses
directed
outside
the
hut
the
beat
of
horses
hoofs
rang
in
the
quarry
nearby
the
dog
barked
again
louder
and
more
angrily
well
demetrio
i
think
you
had
better
hide
all
the
same
stolidly
the
man
finished
eating
next
he
reached
for
a
cantaro
and
gulped
down
the
water
in
it
then
he
stood
up
your
rifle
is
under
the
mat
she
whispered
a
tallow
candle
illumined
the
small
room
in
one
corner
stood
a
plow
a
yoke
a
goad
and
other
agricultural
implements
ropes
hung
from
the
roof
securing
an
old
adobe
mold
used
as
a
bed
on
it
a
child
slept
covered
with
gray
rags
demetrio
buckled
his
cartridge
belt
about
his
waist
and
picked
up
his
rifle
he
was
tall
and
well
built
with
a
sanguine
face
and
beardless
chin
he
wore
shirt
and
trousers
of
white
cloth
a
broad
mexican
hat
and
leather
sandals
with
slow
measured
step
he
left
the
room
vanishing
into
the
impenetrable
darkness
of
the
night
the
dog
excited
to
the
point
of
madness
had
jumped
over
the
corral
fence
suddenly
a
shot
rang
out
the
dog
moaned
then
barked
no
more
some
men
on
horseback
rode
up
shouting
and
sweating
two
of
them
dismounted
while
the
other
hung
back
to
watch
the
horses

see
suddenly
a
white
shadow
loomed
on
the
threshold
demetrio
macias
the
sergeant
cried
as
he
stepped
back
in
terror
the
lieutenant
stood
up
silent
cold
and
motionless
as
a
statue
shoot
them
the
woman
croaked
oh

surely

i
did
know
you
were
there
always
stand
up
for
a
brave
man
demetrio
stood
his
ground
looking
them
up
and
down
an
insolent
and
disdainful
smile
wrinkling
his
face
yes

not
only
respect

men
but
i
like
them
i
proud
and
happy
to
call

then
after
a
pause
all
right
demetrio
macias
if
you
do
want
to
shake
hands
all
right
but
it
because
you
do
know
me
that
why
just
because
the
first
time
you
saw
me
i
was
doing
this
dog
job
but
look
here
i
ask
you
what
in
god
name

a
man
do
when
he
poor
and
has
a
wife
to
support
and
kids
right

are
sergeant
go
i
nothing
but
respect
for
the
home
of
what
i
call
a
brave
man
a
real
honest
genuine
man
when
they
had
gone
the
woman
drew
close
to
demetrio
holy
virgin
what
agony
i
suffered
as
though
it
was
you
they
shot
you
go
to
father
house
quick
demetrio
ordered
she
wanted
to
hold
him
in
her
arms
she
entreated
she
wept
but
he
pushed
away
from
her
gently
and
in
a
sullen
voice
said
i
an
idea
the
whole
lot
of
them
are
coming
why
did
you
kill
their
hour
has
struck
yet
they
went
out
together
she
bore
the
child
in
her
arms
at
the
door
they
separated
moving
off
in
different
directions
the
moon
peopled
the
mountain
with
vague
shadows
as
he
advanced
at
every
turn
of
his
way
demetrio
could
see
the
poignant
sharp
silhouette
of
a
woman
pushing
forward
painfully
bearing
a
child
in
her
arms
when
after
many
hours
of
climbing
he
gazed
back
huge
flames
shot
up
from
the
depths
of
the
canyon
by
the
river
it
was
his
house
blazing
ii
everything
was
still
swathed
in
shadows
as
demetrio
macias
began
his
descent
to
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
between
rocks
striped
with
huge
eroded
cracks
and
a
squarely
cut
wall
with
the
river
flowing
below
a
narrow
ledge
along
the
steep
incline
served
as
a
mountain
trail
they
surely
find
me
now
and
track
us
down
like
dogs
he
mused
it
a
good
thing
they
know
nothing
about
the
trails
and
paths
up
here
but
if
they
got
someone
from
moyahua
to
guide
them
he
left
the
sinister
thought
unfinished
all
the
men
from
limon
or
santa
rosa
or
the
other
nearby
ranches
are
on
our
side
they
would
try
to
trail
us
that
cacique
who
chased
and
run
me
ragged
over
these
hills
is
at
mohayua
now
he
give
his
eyeteeth
to
see
me
dangling
from
a
telegraph
pole
with
my
tongue
hanging
out
of
my
mouth
purple
and
swollen
at
dawn
he
approached
the
pit
of
the
canyon
here
he
lay
on
the
rocks
and
fell
asleep
the
river
crept
along
murmuring
as
the
waters
rose
and
fell
in
small
cascades
birds
sang
lyrically
from
their
hiding
among
the
pitaya
trees
the
monotonous
eternal
drone
of
insects
filled
the
rocky
solitude
with
mystery
demetrio
awoke
with
a
start
he
waded
the
river
following
its
course
which
ran
counter
to
the
canyon
he
climbed
the
crags
laboriously
as
an
ant
gripping
root
and
rock
with
his
hands
clutching
every
stone
in
the
trail
with
his
bare
feet
when
he
reached
the
summit
he
glanced
down
to
see
the
sun
steeping
the
valley
in
a
lake
of
gold
near
the
canyon
enormous
rocks
loomed
protrudent
like
fantastic
negro
skulls
the
pitaya
trees
rose
tenuous
tall
like
the
tapering
gnarled
fingers
of
a
giant
other
trees
of
all
sorts
bowed
their
crests
toward
the
pit
of
the
abyss
amid
the
stark
rocks
and
dry
branches
roses
bloomed
like
a
white
offering
to
the
sun
as
smoothly
suavely
it
unraveled
its
golden
threads
one
by
one
from
rock
to
rock
demetrio
stopped
at
the
summit
reaching
backward
with
his
right
arm
he
drew
his
horn
which
hung
at
his
back
held
it
up
to
his
thick
lips
and
swelling
his
cheeks
out
blew
three
loud
blasts
from
across
the
hill
close
by
three
sharp
whistles
answered
his
signal
in
the
distance
from
a
conical
heap
of
reeds
and
dry
straws
man
after
man
emerged
one
after
the
other
their
legs
and
chests
naked
lambent
and
dark
as
old
bronze
they
rushed
forward
to
greet
demetrio
and
stopped
before
him
askance
they
burnt
my
house
he
said
a
murmur
of
oaths
imprecations
and
threats
rose
among
them
demetrio
let
their
anger
run
its
course
then
he
drew
a
bottle
from
under
his
shirt
and
took
a
deep
swig
then
he
wiped
the
neck
of
the
bottle
with
the
back
of
his
hand
and
passed
it
around
it
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
not
a
drop
was
left
the
men
passed
their
tongues
greedily
over
their
lips
to
recapture
the
tang
of
the
liquor
glory
be
to
god
and
by
his
will
said
demetrio
tonight
or
tomorrow
at
the
latest
we
meet
the
federals
what
do
you
say
boys
shall
we
let
them
find
their
way
about
these
trails
the
ragged
crew
jumped
to
their
feet
uttering
shrill
cries
of
joy
then
their
jubilation
turned
sinister
and
they
gave
vent
to
threats
oaths
and
imprecations
of
course
we
ca
tell
how
strong
they
are
said
demetrio
as
his
glance
traveled
over
their
faces
in
scrutiny
do
you
remember
medina
out
there
at
hostotipaquillo
he
only
had
a
half
a
dozen
men
with
knives
that
they
sharpened
on
a
grindstone
well
he
held
back
the
soldiers
and
the
police
did
he
and
he
beat
them
too
we
every
bit
as
good
as
medina
crowd
said
a
tall
man
with
a
black
beard
and
bushy
eyebrows
by
god

a
mauser
and
a
lot
of
cartridges

montanez
viva

chief
and
long
life
to
god
in
his
heaven
and
to
the
virgin
mary
viva
demetrio
macias
they
all
shouted
they
gathered
dry
brush
and
wood
built
a
fire
and
placed
chunks
of
fresh
meat
upon
the
burning
coals
as
the
blaze
rose
they
collected
about
the
fire
sat
down
and
inhaled
the
odor
of
the
meat
as
it
twisted
on
the
crackling
fire
the
rays
of
the
sun
falling
about
them
cast
a
golden
radiance
over
the
bloody
hide
of
a
calf
lying
on
the
ground
nearby
the
meat
dangled
from
a
rope
fastened
to
a
huizache
tree
to
dry
in
the
sun
and
wind
well
men
demetrio
said
you
know
we
only
twenty
rifles
besides
my
if
there
are
just
a
few
of
them
we
shoot
until
there
not
a
live
man
left
if
there
a
lot
of
we
can
give
a
good
scare
anyhow
he
undid
a
rag
belt
about
his
waist
loosened
a
knot
in
it
and
offered
the
contents
to
his
companions
salt
a
murmur
of
approbation
rose
among
them
as
each
took
a
few
grains
between
the
tips
of
his
fingers
they
ate
voraciously
then
glutted
lay
down
on
the
ground
facing
the
sky
they
sang
monotonous
sad
songs
uttering
a
strident
shout
after
each
stanza
iii
in
the
brush
and
foliage
of
the
sierra
demetrio
macias
and
his
threescore
men
slept
until
the
halloo
of
the
horn
blown
by
pancracio
from
the
crest
of
a
peak
awakened
them
time
boys
look
around
and
see
what
what
anastasio
montanez
said
examining
his
rifle
springs
yet
he
was
previous
an
hour
or
more
elapsed
with
no
sound
or
stir
save
the
song
of
the
locust
in
the
brush
or
the
frog
stirring
in
his
mudhole
at
last
when
the
ultimate
faint
rays
of
the
moon
were
spent
in
the
rosy
dimness
of
the
dawn
the
silhouette
of
a
soldier
loomed
at
the
end
of
the
trail
as
they
strained
their
eyes
they
could
distinguish
others
behind
him
ten
twenty
a
hundred
then
suddenly
darkness
swallowed
them
up
only
when
the
sun
rose
demetrio
band
realized
that
the
canyon
was
alive
with
men
midgets
seated
on
miniature
horses
look
at
will
you
said
pancracio
pretty
ai
they
come
on
boys
let
go
and
roll
marbles
with
now
the
moving
dwarf
figures
were
lost
in
the
dense
chaparral
now
they
reappeared
stark
and
black
against
the
ocher
the
voices
of
officers
as
they
gave
orders
and
soldiers
marching
at
ease
were
clearly
audible
demetrio
raised
his
hand
the
locks
of
rifles
clicked
fire
he
cried
tensely
men
shot

by

the
latter
giving
proof
of
a
marksmanship
which
had
already
made
them
famous

content
to
keep
under
cover
quiet
mute

and
teeth

a
shot
apiece
come
out
of
your
holes
if

lousy
cowards
from
peak
to
peak
the
shouts
rang
as
distinctly
as
though
uttered
across
a
street
suddenly
quail
stood
up
naked
holding
his
trousers
to
windward
as
though
he
were
a
bullfighter
flaunting
a
red
cape
and
the
soldiers
below
the
bull
a
shower
of
shots
peppered
upon
men
god
that
was
like
a
hornet
nest
buzzing
overhead
said
anastasio
montanez
lying
flat
on
the
ground
without
daring
to
wink
an
eye
here
quail
you
son
of
a
bitch
you
stay
where
i
told
you
roared
demetrio
they
crawled
to
take
new
positions
the
soldiers
congratulating
themselves
on
their
successes
ceased
firing
when
another
volley
roused
them
more
coming
they
shouted
some
turned
their
horses
back
others
abandoning
their
mounts
began
to
climb
up
the
mountain
and
seek
shelter
behind
the
rocks
the
officers
had
to
shoot
at
them
to
enforce
discipline
down
there
down
there
said
demetrio
as
he
leveled
his
rifle
at
the
translucent
thread
of
the
river
a
soldier
fell
into
the
water
at
each
shot
invariably
a
soldier
bit
the
dust
only
demetrio
was
shooting
in
that
direction
for
every
soldier
killed
ten
or
twenty
of
them
intact
climbed
afresh
on
the
other
side
get
those
coming
up
from
under
los
de
abajo
get
the
underdogs
he
screamed
now
his
fellows
were
exchanging
rifles
laughing
and
making
wagers
on
their
marksmanship
my
leather
belt
if
i
miss
that
head
there
on
the
black
horse
lend
me
your
rifle
meco
twenty
mauser
cartridges
and
a
half
yard
of
sausage
if
you
let
me
spill
that
lad
riding
the
bay
mare
all
right
watch
me
there
see
him
jump
like
a
bloody
deer
do
run
you
come
along
with
you
come
and
meet
father
demetrio
now
it
was
demetrio
men
who
screamed
insults
manteca
his
smooth
face
swollen
in
exertion
yelled
his
lungs
out
pancracio
roared
the
veins
and
muscles
in
his
neck
dilated
his
murderous
eyes
narrowed
to
two
evil
slits
demetrio
fired
shot
after
shot
constantly
warning
his
men
of
impending
danger
but
they
took
no
heed
until
they
felt
the
bullets
spattering
them
from
one
side
goddamn
their
souls
they
branded
me
demetrio
cried
his
teeth
flashing
then
very
swiftly
he
slid
down
a
gully
and
was
lost
iv
two
men
were
missing
serapio
the
candymaker
and
antonio
who
played
the
cymbals
in
the
juchipila
band
maybe
they
join
us
further
on
said
demetrio
the
return
journey
proved
moody
anastasio
montanez
alone
preserved
his
equanimity
a
kindly
expression
playing
in
his
sleepy
eyes
and
on
his
bearded
face
pancracio
harsh
gorillalike
profile
retained
its
repulsive
immutability
the
soldiers
had
retreated
demetrio
began
the
search
for
the
horses
which
had
been
hidden
in
the
sierra
suddenly
quail
who
had
been
walking
ahead
shrieked
he
had
caught
sight
of
his
companions
swinging
from
the
branches
of
a
mesquite
there
could
be
no
doubt
of
their
identity
serapio
and
antonio
they
certainly
were
anastasio
montanez
prayed
brokenly
our
father
who
art
in
heaven
hallowed
be
thy
name
thy
kingdom
come
amen
his
men
answered
in
low
tones
their
heads
bowed
their
hats
upon
their
breasts
then
hurriedly
they
took
the
juchipila
canyon
northward
without
halting
to
rest
until
nightfall
quail
kept
walking
close
to
anastasio
unable
to
banish
from
his
mind
the
two
who
were
hanged
their
dislocated
limp
necks
their
dangling
legs
their
arms
pendulous
and
their
bodies
moving
slowly
in
the
wind
on
the
morrow
demetrio
complained
bitterly
of
his
wound
he
could
no
longer
ride
on
horseback
they
were
forced
to
carry
him
the
rest
of
the
way
on
a
makeshift
stretcher
of
leaves
and
branches
he
bleeding
frightfully
said
anastasio
montanez
tearing
off
one
of
his
and
tying
it
tightly
about
demetrio
thigh
a
little
above
the
wound
that
good
said
venancio
it
keep
him
from
bleeding
and
stop
the
pain
venancio
was
a
barber
in
his
native
town
he
pulled
teeth
and
fulfilled
the
office
of
medicine
man
he
was
accorded
an
unimpeachable
authority
because
he
had
read
the
wandering
jew
and
one
or
two
other
books
they
called
him
doctor
and
since
he
was
conceited
about
his
knowledge
he
employed
very
few
words
they
took
turns
carrying
the
stretcher
in
relays
of
four
over
the
bare
stony
mesa
and
up
the
steep
passes
at
high
noon
when
the
reflection
of
the
sun
on
the
calcareous
soil
burned
their
shoulders
and
made
the
landscape
dimly
waver
before
their
eyes
the
monotonous
rhythmical
moan
of
the
wounded
rose
in
unison
with
the
ceaseless
cry
of
the
locusts
they
stopped
to
rest
at
every
small
hut
they
found
hidden
between
the
steep
jagged
rocks
thank
god
a
kind
soul
and
tortillas
full
of
beans
and
chili
are
never
lacking
anastasio
montanez
said
with
a
triumphant
belch
the
mountaineers
would
shake
calloused
hands
with
the
travelers
saying
god
blessing
on
you
he
will
find
a
way
to
help
you
all
never
fear
we
going
ourselves
starting
tomorrow
morning
we
dodging
the
draft
with
those
damned
government
people
who
declared
war
to
the
death
on
us
on
all
the
poor
they
come
and
steal
our
pigs
our
chickens
and
corn
they
burn
our
homes
and
carry
our
women
off
and
if
they
ever
get
hold
of
us
they
kill
us
like
mad
dogs
and
we
die
right
there
on
the
spot
and
that
the
end
of
the
story
at
sunset
amid
the
flames
dyeing
the
sky
with
vivid
variegated
colors
they
descried
a
group
of
houses
up
in
the
heart
of
the
blue
mountains
demetrio
ordered
them
to
carry
him
there
these
proved
to
be
a
few
wretched
straw
huts
dispersed
all
over
the
river
slopes
between
rows
of
young
sprouting
corn
and
beans
they
lowered
the
stretcher
and
demetrio
in
a
weak
voice
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
groups
of
squalid
indians
sat
in
the
dark
pits
of
the
huts
men
with
bony
chests
disheveled
matted
hair
and
ruddy
cheeks
behind
them
eyes
shone
up
from
floors
of
fresh
reeds
a
child
with
a
large
belly
and
glossy
dark
skin
came
close
to
the
stretcher
to
inspect
the
wounded
man
an
old
woman
followed
and
soon
all
of
them
drew
about
demetrio
in
a
circle
a
girl
sympathizing
with
him
in
his
plight
brought
a
jicara
of
bluish
water
with
hands
shaking
demetrio
took
it
up
and
drank
greedily
will
you
have
some
more
he
raised
his
eyes
and
glanced
at
the
girl
whose
features
were
common
but
whose
voice
had
a
note
of
kindness
in
it
wiping
his
sweating
brow
with
the
back
of
his
palm
and
turning
on
one
side
he
gasped
may
god
reward
you
then
his
whole
body
shook
making
the
leaves
of
the
stretcher
rustle
fever
possessed
him
he
fainted
it
a
damp
night
and
that
terrible
for
the
fever
said
remigia
an
old
wrinkled
barefooted
woman
wearing
a
cloth
rag
for
a
blouse
she
invited
them
to
move
demetrio
into
her
hut
pancracio
anastasio
montanez
and
quail
lay
down
beside
the
stretcher
like
faithful
dogs
watchful
of
their
master
wishes
the
rest
scattered
about
in
search
of
food
remigia
offered
them
all
she
had
chili
and
tortillas
imagine
i
had
eggs
chickens
even
a
goat
and
her
kid
but
those
damn
soldiers
wiped
me
out
clean
then
making
a
trumpet
of
her
hands
she
drew
near
anastasio
and
murmured
in
his
ear
imagine
they
even
carried
away
senora
nieves
little
girl
v
suddenly
awakening
quail
opened
his
eyes
and
stood
up
montanez
did
you
hear
a
shot
montanez
hey
montanez
get
up
he
shook
him
vigorously
until
montanez
ceased
snoring
and
in
turn
woke
up
what
in
the
name
of
now
you
at
it
again
damn
it
i
tell
you
there
are
ghosts
any
more
anastasio
muttered
out
of
a
i
heard
a
shot
montanez
go
back
to
sleep
quail
or
i
bust
your
nose
hell
anastasio
i
tell
you

fellows
they
hung
honest
it
a
shot
i
tell
you
i
heard
it
all
right
a
shot
you
say
all
right
then
hand
me
my
gun
anastasio
montanez
rubbed
his
eyes
stretched
out
his
arms
and
legs
and
stood
up
lazily
they
left
the
hut
the
sky
was
solid
with
stars
the
moon
rose
like
a
sharp
scythe
the
confused
rumor
of
women
crying
in
fright
resounded
from
the
various
huts
the
men
who
had
been
sleeping
in
the
open
also
woke
up
and
the
rattle
of
arms
echoed
over
the
mountain
you
cursed
fool
you
maimed
me
for
life
a
voice
rang
clearly
through
the
darkness
who
goes
there
the
shout
echoed
from
rock
to
rock
through
mound
and
over
hollow
until
it
spent
itself
at
the
far
silent
reaches
of
the
night
who
goes
there
anastasio
repeated
his
challenge
louder
pulling
back
the
lock
of
his
mauser
one
of
demetrio
men
came
the
answer
it
pancracio
quail
cried
joyfully
relieved
he
rested
the
butt
of
his
rifle
on
the
ground
pancracio
appeared
holding
a
young
man
by
the
arms
the
newcomer
was
covered
with
dust
from
his
felt
hat
to
his
coarse
shoes
a
fresh
bloodstain
lay
on
his
trousers
close
to
the
heel
who
this
tenderfoot
anastasio
demanded
you
know
i
on
guard
around
here
well
i
hears
a
noise
in
the
brush
see
and
i
shouts
goes
there
and
then
this
lad
answers
carranza
i
do
know
anyone
by
that
name
and
so
i
says
hell
and
i
just
pumps
a
bit
of
lead
into
his
hoof
smiling
pancracio
turned
his
beardless
head
around
as
if
soliciting
applause
then
the
stranger
spoke
who
your
commander
proudly
anastasio
raised
his
head
went
up
to
him
and
looked
him
in
the
face
the
stranger
lowered
his
tone
considerably
well
i
a
revolutionist
too
you
know
the
government
drafted
me
and
i
served
as
a
private
but
i
managed
to
desert
during
the
battle
the
day
before
yesterday
and
i
been
walking
about
in
search
of
you
all
so
he
a
government
soldier
eh
a
murmur
of
incredulity
rose
from
the
men
interrupting
the
stranger
so
that
what
you
are
eh
one
of
those
damn
said
anastasio
montanez
why
the
hell
did
you
pump
your
lead
in
his
brain
pancracio
what
he
talking
about
anyhow
i
ca
make
head
nor
tail
of
it
he
says
he
wants
to
see
demetrio
and
that
he
got
plenty
to
say
to
him
but
that
all
right
we
got
plenty
of
time
to
do
anything
we
damn
well
please
so
long
as
you
in
no
hurry
that
all
said
pancracio
loading
his
gun
what
kind
of
beasts
are
you
the
prisoner
cried
he
could
say
no
more
anastasio
fist
crashing
down
upon
his
face
sent
his
head
turning
on
his
neck
covered
with
blood
shoot
the
hang
him
burn
him
alive
he
a
lousy
federal
in
great
excitement
they
yelled
and
shrieked
and
were
about
to
fire
at
the
prisoner
sssh
shut
up
i
think
demetrio
talking
now
anastasio
said
striving
to
quiet
them
indeed
demetrio
having
ascertained
the
cause
of
the
turmoil
ordered
them
to
bring
the
prisoner
before
him
it
positively
infamous
senor
look
luis
cervantes
said
pointing
to
the
bloodstains
on
his
trousers
and
to
his
bleeding
face
all
right
all
right
but
who
in
hell
are
you
that
what
i
want
to
know
demetrio
said
my
name
is
luis
cervantes
sir
i
a
medical
student
and
a
journalist
i
wrote
a
piece
in
favor
of
the
revolution
you
see
as
a
result
they
persecuted
me
caught
me
and
finally
landed
me
in
the
barracks
his
ensuing
narrative
was
couched
in
terms
of
such
detail
and
expressed
in
terms
so
melodramatic
that
it
drew
guffaws
of
mirth
from
pancracio
and
manteca
all
i
tried
to
do
is
to
make
myself
clear
on
this
point
i
want
you
to
be
convinced
that
i
am
truly
one
of
your
coreligionists
what
that
what
did
you
say
car
what
demetrio
asked
bringing
his
ear
close
to
cervantes
coreligionist
sir
that
is
to
say
a
person
who
possesses
the
same
religion
who
is
inspired
by
the
same
ideals
who
defends
and
fights
for
the
same
cause
you
are
now
fighting
for
demetrio
smiled
what
are
we
fighting
for
that
what
i
like
to
know
in
his
disconcertment
luis
cervantes
could
find
no
reply
look
at
that
mug
look
at
why
waste
any
time
demetrio
shoot
him
pancracio
urged
impatiently
demetrio
laid
a
hand
on
his
hair
which
covered
his
ears
and
stretching
himself
out
for
a
long
time
seemed
to
be
lost
in
thought
having
found
no
solution
he
said
get
out
all
of
you
it
aching
again
anastasio
put
out
the
candle
lock
him
up
in
the
corral
and
let
pancracio
and
manteca
watch
him
tomorrow
we
see
vi
through
the
shadows
of
the
starry
night
luis
cervantes
had
not
yet
managed
to
detect
the
exact
shape
of
the
objects
about
him
seeking
the
most
suitable
he
laid
his
weary
bones
down
on
a
fresh
pile
of
manure
under
the
blurred
mass
of
a
huizache
tree
he
lay
down
more
exhausted
than
resigned
and
closed
his
eyes
resolutely
determined
to
sleep
until
his
fierce
keepers
or
the
morning
sun
burning
his
ears
awakened
him
something
vaguely
like
warmth
at
his
side
then
a
tired
hoarse
breath
made
him
shudder
he
opened
his
eyes
and
feeling
about
him
with
his
hands
he
sensed
the
coarse
hairs
of
a
large
pig
which
resenting
the
presence
of
a
neighbor
began
to
grunt
all
luis
efforts
to
sleep
proved
quite
useless
not
only
because
the
pain
of
his
wound
or
the
bruises
on
his
flesh
smarted
but
because
he
suddenly
realized
the
exact
nature
of
his
failure
yes
failure
for
he
had
never
learned
to
appreciate
exactly
the
difference
between
fulminating
sentences
of
death
upon
bandits
in
the
columns
of
a
small
country
newspaper
and
actually
setting
out
in
search
of
them
and
tracking
them
to
their
lairs
gun
in
hand
during
his
first
day
march
as
volunteer
lieutenant
he
had
begun
to
suspect
the
error
of
his
ways
a
brutal
sixty
miles
journey
it
was
that
left
his
hips
and
legs
one
mass
of
raw
soreness
and
soldered
all
his
bones
together
a
week
later
after
his
first
skirmish
against
the
rebels
he
understood
every
rule
of
the
game
luis
cervantes
would
have
taken
up
a
crucifix
and
solemnly
sworn
that
as
soon
as
the
soldiers
gun
in
hand
stood
ready
to
shoot
some
profoundly
eloquent
voice
had
spoken
behind
them
saying
run
for
your
lives
it
was
all
crystal
clear
even
his
horse
accustomed
to
battle
sought
to
sweep
back
on
its
hind
legs
and
gallop
furiously
away
to
stop
only
at
a
safe
distance
from
the
sound
of
firing
the
sun
was
setting
the
mountain
became
peopled
with
vague
and
restless
shadows
darkness
scaled
the
ramparts
of
the
mountain
hastily
what
could
be
more
logical
then
than
to
seek
refuge
behind
the
rocks
and
attempt
to
sleep
granting
mind
and
body
a
sorely
needed
rest
but
the
soldier
logic
is
the
logic
of
absurdity
on
the
morrow
for
example
his
colonel
awakened
him
rudely
out
of
his
sleep
cuffing
and
belaboring
him
unmercifully
and
after
having
bashed
in
his
face
deprived
him
of
his
place
of
vantage
the
rest
of
the
officers
moreover
burst
into
hilarious
mirth
and
holding
their
sides
with
laughter
begged
the
colonel
to
pardon
the
deserter
the
colonel
therefore
instead
of
sentencing
him
to
be
shot
kicked
his
buttocks
roundly
for
him
and
assigned
him
to
kitchen
police
this
signal
insult
was
destined
to
bear
poisonous
fruit
luis
cervantes
determined
to
play
turncoat
indeed
mentally
he
had
already
changed
sides
did
not
the
sufferings
of
the
underdogs
of
the
disinherited
masses
move
him
to
the
core
henceforth
he
espoused
the
cause
of
demos
of
the
subjugated
the
beaten
and
baffled
who
implore
justice
and
justice
alone
he
became
intimate
with
the
humblest
private
more
even
he
shed
tears
of
compassion
over
a
dead
mule
which
fell
load
and
all
after
a
terribly
long
journey
from
then
on
luis
cervantes
prestige
with
the
soldiers
increased
some
actually
dared
to
make
confessions
one
among
them
conspicuous
for
his
sobriety
and
silence
told
him
i
a
carpenter
by
trade
you
know
i
had
a
mother
an
old
woman
nailed
to
her
chair
for
ten
years
by
rheumatism
in
the
middle
of
the
night
they
pulled
me
out
of
my
house
three
damn
policemen
i
woke
up
a
soldier
miles
away
from
my
hometown
a
month
ago
our
company
passed
by
there
again
my
mother
was
already
under
the
sod
so
there
nothing
left
for
me
in
this
wide
world
no
one
misses
me
now
you
see
but
by
god
i
damned
if
i
use
these
cartridges
they
make
us
carry
against
the
enemy
if
a
miracle
happens
i
pray
for
it
every
night
you
know
and
i
guess
our
lady
of
guadalupe
can
do
it
all
right
then
i
join
villa
men
and
i
swear
by
the
holy
soul
of
my
old
mother
that
i
make
every
one
of
these
government
people
pay
by
god
i
will
another
soldier
a
bright
young
fellow
but
a
charlatan
at
heart
who
drank
habitually
and
smoked
the
narcotic
marihuana
weed
eyeing
him
with
vague
glassy
stare
whispered
in
his
ear
you
know
partner
the
men
on
the
other
side
you
know
the
other
side
you
understand
they
ride
the
best
horses
up
north
there
and
all
over
see
and
they
harness
their
mounts
with
pure
hammered
silver
but
us
oh
hell
we
got
to
ride
plugs
that
all
and
not
one
of
them
good
enough
to
stagger
round
a
water
well
you
see
do
you
partner
you
see
what
i
mean
you
know
the
men
on
the
other
get
shiny
new
silver
coins
while
we
get
only
lousy
paper
money
printed
in
that
murderer
factory
that
what
we
get
yes
that
ours
i
tell
you
the
majority
of
the
soldiers
spoke
in
much
the
same
tenor
even
a
top
sergeant
candidly
confessed
yes
i
enlisted
all
right
i
wanted
to
but
by
god
i
missed
the
right
side
by
a
long
shot
what
you
make
in
a
lifetime
sweating
like
a
mule
and
breaking
your
back
in
peacetime
damn
it
all
you
can
make
in
a
few
months
just
running
around
the
sierra
with
a
gun
on
your
back
but
not
with
this
crowd
dearie
not
with
this
lousy
outfit
luis
cervantes
who
already
shared
this
hidden
implacably
mortal
hatred
of
the
upper
classes
of
his
officers
and
of
his
superiors
felt
that
a
veil
had
been
removed
from
his
eyes
clearly
now
he
saw
the
final
outcome
of
the
struggle
and
yet
what
had
happened
the
first
moment
he
was
able
to
join
his
coreligionists
instead
of
welcoming
him
with
open
arms
they
threw
him
into
a
pigsty
with
swine
for
company
day
broke
the
roosters
crowed
in
the
huts
the
chickens
perched
in
the
huizache
began
to
stretch
their
wings
shake
their
feathers
and
fly
down
to
the
ground
luis
cervantes
saw
his
guards
lying
on
top
of
a
dung
heap
snoring
in
his
imagination
he
reviewed
the
features
of
last
night
men
one
pancracio
was
pockmarked
blotchy
unshaven
his
chin
protruded
his
forehead
receded
obliquely
his
ears
formed
one
solid
piece
with
head
and
neck
a
horrible
man
the
other
manteca
was
so
much
human
refuse
his
eyes
were
almost
hidden
his
look
sullen
his
wiry
straight
hair
fen
over
his
ears
forehead
and
neck
his
scrofulous
lips
hung
eternally
agape
once
more
luis
cervantes
felt
his
flesh
quiver
vii
still
drowsy
demetrio
ran
his
hand
through
his
ruffled
hair
which
hung
over
his
moist
forehead
pushed
it
back
over
his
ears
and
opened
his
eyes
distinctly
he
heard
the
woman
melodious
voice
which
he
had
already
sensed
in
his
dream
he
walked
toward
the
door
it
was
broad
daylight
the
rays
of
sunlight
filtered
through
the
thatch
of
the
hut
the
girl
who
had
offered
him
water
the
day
before
the
girl
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
all
night
long
now
came
forward
kindly
and
eager
as
ever
this
time
she
carried
a
pitcher
of
milk
brimming
over
with
foam
it
goat
milk
but
fine
just
the
same
come
on
now
taste
it
demetrio
smiled
gratefully
straightened
up
grasped
the
clay
pitcher
and
proceeded
to
drink
the
milk
in
little
gulps
without
removing
his
eyes
from
the
girl
she
grew
lowered
her
eyes
what
your
name
he
asked
camilla
ah
there
a
lovely
name
and
the
girl
that
bears
it
lovelier
still
camilla
blushed
as
he
sought
to
seize
her
wrist
she
grew
frightened
and
picking
up
the
empty
pitcher
flew
out
the
door
no
demetrio
anastasio
montanez
commented
gravely
you
got
to
break
them
in
first
hmm
it
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
scars
the
women
have
left
on
my
body
yes
my
friend
i
a
heap
of
experience
along
that
line
i
feel
all
right
now
compadre
demetrio
pretended
he
had
not
heard
him
i
had
fever
and
i
sweated
like
a
horse
all
night
but
i
feel
quite
fresh
today
the
thing
that
irking
me
hellishly
is
that
goddamn
wound
can
venancio
to
look
after
me
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
the
tenderfoot
we
caught
last
night
pancracio
asked
that
right
i
was
forgetting
all
about
him
as
usual
demetrio
hesitated
a
while
before
he
reached
a
decision
here
quail
come
here
listen
you
go
and
find
out
where
the
nearest
church
around
here
i
know
there
one
about
six
miles
away
go
and
steal
a
priest
robe
and
bring
it
back
what
the
idea
asked
pancracio
in
surprise
well
i
soon
find
out
if
this
tenderfoot
came
here
to
murder
me
i
tell
him
he
to
be
shot
see
and
quail
will
put
on
the
robes
say
that
he
a
priest
and
hear
his
confession
if
he
got
anything
up
his
sleeve
he
come
out
with
it
and
then
i
shoot
him
otherwise
i
let
him
go
god
there
a
roundabout
way
to
tackle
the
question
if
i
were
you
i
just
shoot
him
and
let
it
go
at
that
said
pancracio
contemptuously
that
night
quail
returned
with
the
priest
robes
demetrio
ordered
the
prisoner
to
be
led
in
luis
cervantes
had
not
eaten
or
slept
for
two
days
there
were
deep
black
circles
under
his
eyes
his
face
was
deathly
pale
his
lips
dry
and
colorless
he
spoke
awkwardly
slowly
you
can
do
as
you
please
with
me
i
am
convinced
i
was
wrong
to
come
looking
for
you
there
was
a
prolonged
silence
then
i
thought
that
you
would
welcome
a
man
who
comes
to
offer
his
help
with
open
arms
even
though
his
help
was
quite
worthless
after
all
you
might
perhaps
have
found
some
use
for
it
what
in
heaven
name
do
i
stand
to
gain
whether
the
revolution
wins
or
loses
little
by
little
he
grew
more
animated
at
times
the
languor
in
his
eyes
disappeared
the
revolution
benefits
the
poor
the
ignorant
all
those
who
have
been
slaves
all
their
lives
all
the
unhappy
people
who
do
not
even
suspect
they
are
poor
because
the
rich
who
stand
above
them
the
rich
who
rule
them
change
their
sweat
and
blood
and
tears
into
gold
well
what
the
hell
is
the
gist
of
all
this
palaver
i
be
damned
if
i
can
stomach
a
sermon
pancracio
broke
in
i
wanted
to
fight
for
the
sacred
cause
of
the
oppressed
but
you
understand
you
cast
me
aside
very
well
then
you
can
do
as
you
please
with
me
all
i
going
to
do
now
is
to
put
this
rope
around
your
neck
look
what
a
pretty
white
neck
you
got
yes
i
know
what
brought
you
here
demetrio
interrupted
dryly
scratching
his
head
i
going
to
have
you
shot
then
looking
at
anastasio
he
said
take
him
away
and
if
he
wants
to
confess
bring
the
priest
to
him
impassive
as
ever
anastasio
took
the
prisoner
gently
by
the
arm
come
along
this
way
tenderfoot
they
all
laughed
uproariously
when
a
few
minutes
later
quail
appeared
in
priestly
robes
by
god
this
tenderfoot
certainly
talks
his
head
off
quail
said
you
know
i
a
notion
he
was
having
a
bit
of
a
laugh
on
me
when
i
started
asking
him
questions
but
did
he
have
anything
to
say
nothing
save
what
he
said
last
night
i
a
hunch
he
did
come
here
to
shoot
you
at
all
compadre
said
anastasio
give
him
something
to
eat
and
guard
him
viii
on
the
morrow
luis
cervantes
was
barely
able
to
get
up
his
injured
leg
trailing
behind
him
he
shuffled
from
hut
to
hut
in
search
of
a
little
alcohol
a
kettle
of
boiled
water
and
some
rags
with
unfailing
kindness
camilla
provided
him
with
all
that
he
wanted
as
he
began
washing
his
foot
she
sat
beside
him
and
with
typical
mountaineer
curiosity
inquired
tell
me
who
learned
you
how
to
cure
people
why
did
you
boil
that
water
why
did
you
boil
the
rags
look
look
how
careful
you
are
about
everything
and
what
did
you
put
on
your
hands
really
and
why
did
you
pour
on
alcohol
i
just
knew
alcohol
was
good
to
rub
on
when
you
had
a
bellyache
but
oh
i
see
so
you
was
going
to
be
a
doctor
huh
ha
ha
that
a
good
one
why
do
you
mix
it
with
cold
water
well
there
a
funny
sort
of
a
trick
oh
stop
fooling
me
the
idea
little
animals
alive
in
the
water
unless
you
boil
it
ugh
well
i
ca
see
nothing
in
it
myself
camilla
continued
to
him
with
such
familiarity
that
she
suddenly
found
herself
addressing
him
intimately
in
the
singular
tu
absorbed
in
his
own
thoughts
luis
cervantes
had
ceased
listening
to
her
he
thought
where
are
those
men
on
pancho
villa
payroll
so
admirably
equipped
and
mounted
who
only
get
paid
in
those
pure
silver
pieces
villa
coins
at
the
chihuahua
mint
bah
barely
two
dozen
mangy
men
some
of
them
riding
decrepit
mares
with
the
coat
nibbled
off
from
neck
to
withers
can
the
accounts
given
by
the
government
newspapers
and
by
myself
be
really
true
and
are
these
revolutionists
simply
bandits
grouped
together
using
the
revolution
as
a
wonderful
pretext
to
glut
their
thirst
for
gold
and
blood
is
it
all
a
lie
then
were
their
sympathizers
talking
a
lot
of
exalted
nonsense
if
on
one
hand
the
government
newspapers
vied
with
each
other
in
noisy
proclamation
of
federal
victory
after
victory
why
then
had
a
paymaster
on
his
way
from
guadalajara
started
the
rumor
that
president
friends
and
relatives
were
abandoning
the
capital
and
scuttling
away
to
the
nearest
port
was
huerta
i
shall
have
peace
at
no
matter
what
cost
a
meaningless
growl
well
it
looked
as
though
the
revolutionists
or
bandits
call
them
what
you
will
were
going
to
depose
the
government
tomorrow
would
therefore
belong
wholly
to
them
a
man
must
consequently
be
on
their
side
only
on
their
side
no
he
said
to
himself
almost
aloud
i
do
think
i
made
a
mistake
this
time
what
did
you
say
camilla
asked
i
thought
you
lost
your
tongue
i
thought
the
mice
had
eaten
it
up
luis
cervantes
frowned
and
cast
a
hostile
glance
at
this
little
plump
monkey
with
her
bronzed
complexion
her
ivory
teeth
and
her
thick
square
toes
look
here
tenderfoot
you
know
how
to
tell
fairy
stories
do
you
for
all
answer
luis
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
moved
off
the
girl
ecstatic
glance
following
his
retreating
figure
until
it
was
lost
on
the
river
path
so
profound
was
her
absorption
that
she
shuddered
in
nervous
surprise
as
she
heard
the
voice
of
her
neighbor
maria
antonia
who
had
been
spying
from
her
hut
shouting
hey
you
there
give
him
some
love
powder
then
he
might
fall
for
you
that
what
you
do
all
right
oh
you
think
so
do
you
well
you
quite
wrong
faugh
i
despise
a
tenderfoot
and
do
forget
it
ix
ho
there
remigia
lend
me
some
eggs
will
you
my
chicken
has
been
hatching
since
morning
there
some
gentlemen
here
come
to
eat
her
neighbor
eyes
blinked
as
the
bright
sunlight
poured
into
the
shadowy
hut
darker
than
usual
even
as
dense
clouds
of
smoke
rose
from
the
stove
after
a
few
minutes
she
began
to
make
out
the
contour
of
the
various
objects
inside
and
recognized
the
wounded
stretcher
which
lay
in
one
corner
close
to
the
galvanized
iron
roof
she
sat
down
beside
remigia
and
glancing
furtively
toward
where
demetrio
rested
asked
in
a
low
voice
how
the
patient
better
that
fine
oh
how
young
he
is
but
still
pale
do
you
think
so
the
wound
not
closed
up
yet
well
remigia
do
you
think
we
better
try
and
do
something
about
it
remigia
naked
from
the
waist
up
stretched
her
thin
muscular
arms
over
the
corn
grinder
pounding
the
corn
with
a
stone
bar
she
held
in
her
hands
oh
i
do
know
they
might
not
like
it
she
answered
breathing
heavily
as
she
continued
her
rude
task
they
got
their
own
doctor
you
know
so
hallo
there
remigia
another
neighbor
said
as
she
came
in
bowing
her
bony
back
to
pass
through
the
opening
have
you
any
laurel
leaves
we
want
to
make
a
potion
for
maria
antonia
who
not
so
well
today
what
with
her
bellyache
in
reality
her
errand
was
but
a
pretext
for
asking
questions
and
passing
the
time
of
day
in
gossip
so
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
corner
where
the
patient
lay
and
winking
sought
information
as
to
his
health
remigia
lowered
her
eyes
to
indicate
that
demetrio
was
sleeping
oh
i
did
see
you
when
i
came
in
and
you
here
too
panchita
well
how
are
you
good
morning
to
you
fortunata
how
are
you
all
right
but
maria
antonia
got
the
curse
today
and
her
aching
something
fierce
she
sat
with
bent
knees
huddling
hip
to
hip
against
panchita
i
got
no
laurel
leaves
honey
remigia
answered
pausing
a
moment
in
her
work
to
push
a
mop
of
hair
back
from
over
her
sweaty
forehead
then
plunging
her
two
hands
into
a
mass
of
corn
she
removed
a
handful
of
it
dripping
with
muddy
yellowish
water
i
none
at
all
better
go
to
dolores
she
always
got
herbs
you
know
but
dolores
went
to
cofradia
last
night
i
do
know
but
they
say
they
came
to
fetch
her
to
help
uncle
matias
girl
who
big
with
child
you
do
say
panchita
the
three
old
women
came
together
forming
an
animated
group
and
speaking
in
low
tones
began
to
gossip
with
great
gusto
certainly
i
swear
it
by
god
up
there
in
heaven
well
well
i
was
the
first
one
to
say
that
marcelina
was
big
with
child
was
i
but
of
course
no
one
would
believe
me
poor
girl
it
going
to
be
terrible
if
the
kid
is
her
uncle
you
know
god
forbid
of
course
it
not
her
uncle
nazario
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
know
it
was
them
damned
soldiers
that
who
done
it
god
what
a
bloody
mess
another
unhappy
woman
the
cackle
of
the
old
hens
finally
awakened
demetrio
they
kept
silent
for
a
moment
then
panchita
taking
out
of
the
bosom
of
her
blouse
a
young
pigeon
which
opened
its
beak
in
suffocation
said
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
brought
this
medicine
for
the
gentleman
here
but
they
say
he
got
a
doctor
so
i
suppose
that
makes
no
difference
panchita
that
no
medicine
anyhow
simply
something
to
rub
on
his
body
forgive
this
poor
gift
from
a
poor
woman
senor
said
the
wrinkled
old
woman
drawing
close
to
demetrio
but
there
nothing
like
it
in
the
world
for
hemorrhages
and
suchlike
demetrio
nodded
hasty
approval
they
had
already
placed
a
loaf
of
bread
soaked
in
alcohol
on
his
stomach
although
when
this
was
removed
he
began
to
be
cooler
he
felt
that
he
was
still
feverish
inside
come
on
remigia
you
do
it
you
certainly
know
how
the
women
said
out
of
a
reed
sheath
remigia
pulled
a
long
and
curved
knife
which
served
to
cut
cactus
fruit
she
took
the
pigeon
in
one
hand
turned
it
over
its
breast
upward
and
with
the
skill
of
a
surgeon
ripped
it
in
two
with
a
single
thrust
in
the
name
of
jesus
mary
and
joseph
remigia
said
blessing
the
room
and
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
next
with
infinite
dexterity
she
placed
the
warm
bleeding
portions
of
the
pigeon
upon
abdomen
you
see
you
feel
much
better
now
obeying
remigia
instructions
demetrio
lay
motionless
crumpled
up
on
one
side
then
fortunata
gave
vent
to
her
sorrows
she
liked
these
gentlemen
of
the
revolution
all
right
that
she
did
for
three
months
ago
you
know
the
government
soldiers
had
run
away
with
her
only
daughter
this
had
broken
her
heart
yes
and
driven
her
all
but
crazy
as
she
began
anastasio
montanez
and
quail
lay
on
the
floor
near
the
stretcher
their
mouths
gaping
all
ears
to
the
story
but
wealth
of
detail
by
the
time
she
had
told
half
of
it
bored
quail
and
he
left
the
hut
to
scratch
himself
out
in
the
sun
by
the
time
fortunata
had
at
last
concluded
with
a
solemn
i
pray
god
and
the
blessed
virgin
mary
that
you
are
not
sparing
the
life
of
a
single
one
of
those
federals
from
hell
demetrio
face
to
wall
felt
greatly
relieved
by
the
stomach
cure
and
was
busy
thinking
of
the
best
route
by
which
to
proceed
to
durango
anastasio
montanez
was
snoring
like
a
trombone
x
why
do
you
call
in
the
tenderfoot
to
treat
you
compadre
demetrio
anastasio
montanez
asked
his
chief
who
had
been
complaining
daily
of
chills
and
fever
you
ought
to
see
him
no
one
has
laid
a
hand
to
him
but
himself
and
now
he
so
fit
that
he
does
limp
a
step
but
venancio
standing
by
with
his
tins
of
lard
and
his
dirty
string
rags
ready
protested
all
right
if
anybody
lays
a
hand
on
demetrio
i
wo
be
responsible
nonsense
rot
what
kind
of
doctor
do
you
think
you
are
you
no
doctor
at
all
i
wager
you
already
forgotten
why
you
ever
joined
us
said
quail
well
i
remember
why
you
joined
us
quail
venancio
replied
angrily
perhaps
you
deny
it
was
because
you
had
stolen
a
watch
and
some
diamond
rings
ha
ha
ha
that
rich
but
you
worse
my
lad
you
ran
away
from
your
hometown
because
you
poisoned
your
sweetheart
you
a
goddamned
liar
yes
you
did
and
do
try
and
deny
it
you
fed
her
spanish
fly
and
venancio
shout
of
protest
was
drowned
out
in
the
loud
laughter
of
the
others
demetrio
looking
pale
and
sallow
motioned
for
silence
then
plaintively
that
do
bring
in
the
student
luis
cervantes
entered
he
uncovered
demetrio
wound
examined
it
carefully
and
shook
his
head
the
ligaments
had
made
a
furrow
in
the
skin
the
leg
badly
swollen
seemed
about
to
burst
at
every
move
he
made
demetrio
stifled
a
moan
luis
cervantes
cut
the
ligaments
soaked
the
wound
in
water
covered
the
leg
with
large
clean
rags
and
bound
it
up
demetrio
was
able
to
sleep
all
afternoon
and
all
night
on
the
morrow
he
woke
up
happy
that
tenderfoot
has
the
softest
hand
in
the
world
he
said
quickly
venancio
cut
in
all
right
just
as
you
say
but
do
forget
that
tenderfoots
are
like
moisture
they
seep
in
everywhere
it
the
tenderfoots
who
stopped
us
reaping
the
harvest
of
the
revolution
since
demetrio
believed
in
the
barber
knowledge
implicitly
when
luis
cervantes
came
to
treat
him
on
the
next
day
he
said
look
here
do
your
best
see
i
want
to
recover
soon
and
then
you
can
go
home
or
anywhere
else
you
damn
well
please
discreetly
luis
cervantes
made
no
reply
a
week
ten
days
a
fortnight
elapsed
the
federal
troops
seemed
to
have
vanished
there
was
an
abundance
of
corn
and
beans
too
in
the
neighboring
ranches
the
people
hated
the
government
so
bitterly
that
they
were
overjoyed
to
furnish
assistance
to
the
rebels
men
therefore
were
peacefully
waiting
for
the
complete
recovery
of
their
chief
day
after
day
luis
cervantes
remained
humble
and
silent
by
god
i
actually
believe
you
in
love
demetrio
said
jokingly
one
morning
after
the
daily
treatment
he
had
begun
to
like
this
tenderfoot
from
then
on
demetrio
began
gradually
to
show
an
increasing
interest
in
cervantes
comfort
one
day
he
asked
him
if
the
soldiers
gave
him
his
daily
ration
of
meat
and
milk
luis
cervantes
was
forced
to
answer
that
his
sole
nourishment
was
whatever
the
old
ranch
women
happened
to
give
him
and
that
everyone
still
considered
him
an
intruder
look
here
tenderfoot
they
all
good
boys
really
demetrio
answered
you
got
to
know
how
to
handle
them
that
all
you
mark
my
words
from
tomorrow
on
there
wo
be
a
thing
you
lack
in
effect
things
began
to
change
that
very
afternoon
some
of
demetrio
men
lay
in
the
quarry
glancing
at
the
sunset
that
turned
the
clouds
into
huge
clots
of
congealed
blood
and
listening
to
venancio
amusing
stories
culled
from
the
wandering
jew
some
of
them
lulled
by
the
narrator
mellifluous
voice
began
to
snore
but
luis
cervantes
listened
avidly
and
as
soon
as
venancio
topped
off
his
talk
with
a
storm
of
anticlerical
denunciations
he
said
emphatically
wonderful
wonderful
what
intelligence
you
a
most
gifted
man
well
i
reckon
it
not
so
bad
venancio
answered
warming
to
the
flattery
but
my
parents
died
and
i
did
have
a
chance
to
study
for
a
profession
that
easy
to
remedy
i
sure
once
our
cause
is
victorious
you
can
easily
get
a
degree
a
matter
of
two
or
three
weeks
assistant
work
at
some
hospital
and
a
letter
of
recommendation
from
our
chief
and
you
be
a
doctor
all
right
the
thing
is
child
play
from
that
night
onward
venancio
unlike
the
others
ceased
calling
him
tenderfoot
he
addressed
him
as
louie
it
was
louie
this
and
louie
that
right
and
left
all
the
time
xi
look
here
tenderfoot
i
want
to
tell
you
something
camilla
called
to
luis
cervantes
as
he
made
his
way
to
the
hut
to
fetch
some
boiling
water
for
his
foot
for
days
the
girl
had
been
restless
her
coy
ways
and
her
reticence
had
finally
annoyed
the
man
stopping
suddenly
he
stood
up
and
eyeing
her
squarely
all
right
what
do
you
want
to
tell
me
camilla
tongue
clove
to
her
mouth
heavy
and
damp
as
a
rag
she
could
not
utter
a
word
a
blush
suffused
her
cheeks
turning
them
red
as
apples
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
bowed
her
head
pressing
her
chin
against
her
naked
breast
then
without
moving
with
the
fixity
of
an
idiot
she
glanced
at
the
wound
and
said
in
a
whisper
look
how
nicely
it
healing
now
it
like
a
red
castille
rose
luis
cervantes
frowned
and
with
obvious
disgust
continued
to
care
for
his
foot
completely
ignoring
her
as
he
worked
when
he
had
finished
camilla
had
vanished
for
three
days
she
was
nowhere
to
be
found
it
was
always
her
mother
agapita
who
answered
cervantes
call
and
boiled
the
water
for
him
and
gave
him
rags
he
was
careful
to
avoid
questioning
her
three
days
later
camilla
reappeared
more
coy
and
eager
than
ever
the
more
distrait
and
indifferent
luis
cervantes
grew
the
bolder
camilla
at
last
she
said
listen
to
me
you
nice
young
fellow
i
want
to
tell
you
something
pleasant
please
go
over
the
words
of
the
revolutionary
song
with
me
will
you
you
can
guess
why
eh
i
want
to
sing
it
and
sing
it
over
again
often
and
often
see
then
when
you
off
and
away
and
when
you
forgotten
all
about
camilla
it
remind
me
of
you
to
luis
cervantes
her
words
were
like
the
noise
of
a
sharp
steel
knife
drawn
over
the
side
of
a
glass
bottle
blissfully
unaware
of
the
effect
they
had
produced
she
proceeded
candid
as
ever
well
i
want
to
tell
you
something
you
do
know
that
your
chief
is
a
wicked
man
do
you
shall
i
tell
you
what
he
did
to
me
you
know
demetrio
wo
let
a
soul
but
mamma
cook
for
him
and
me
take
him
his
food
well
the
other
day
i
take
some
food
over
to
him
and
what
do
you
think
he
did
to
me
the
old
fool
he
grabs
hold
of
my
wrist
and
he
presses
it
tight
tight
as
can
be
and
then
he
starts
pinching
my
legs
on
let
me
go
i
said
still
lay
off
you
shameless
creature
you
got
no
manners
that
the
trouble
with
you
so
i
wrestled
with
him
and
shook
myself
free
like
this
and
ran
off
as
fast
as
i
could
what
do
you
think
of
that
camilla
had
never
seen
luis
cervantes
laugh
so
heartily
but
it
is
really
true
all
this
you
told
me
utterly
at
a
loss
camilla
could
not
answer
then
he
burst
into
laughter
again
and
repeated
the
question
a
sense
of
confusion
came
upon
her
disturbed
troubled
she
said
brokenly
yes
it
the
truth
and
i
wanted
to
tell
you
about
it
but
you
seem
to
feel
at
all
angry
once
more
camilla
glanced
adoringly
at
luis
cervantes
radiant
clean
face
at
his
glaucous
soft
eyes
his
cheeks
pink
and
polished
as
a
porcelain
doll
at
his
tender
white
skin
that
showed
below
the
line
of
his
collar
and
on
his
shoulders
protruding
from
under
a
rough
woolen
poncho
at
his
hair
ever
so
slightly
curled
what
the
devil
are
you
waiting
for
fool
if
the
chief
likes
you
what
more
do
you
want
camilla
felt
something
rise
within
her
breast
an
empty
ache
that
became
a
knot
when
it
reached
her
throat
she
closed
her
eyes
fast
to
hold
back
the
tears
that
welled
up
in
them
then
with
the
back
of
her
hand
she
wiped
her
wet
cheeks
and
just
as
she
had
done
three
days
ago
fled
with
all
the
swiftness
of
a
young
deer
xii
demetrio
wound
had
already
healed
they
began
to
discuss
various
projects
to
go
northward
where
according
to
rumor
the
rebels
had
beaten
the
federal
troops
all
along
the
line
a
certain
incident
came
to
precipitate
their
action
seated
on
a
crag
of
the
sierra
in
the
cool
of
the
afternoon
breeze
luis
cervantes
gazed
away
in
the
distance
dreaming
and
killing
time
below
the
narrow
rock
pancracio
and
manteca
lying
like
lizards
between
the
jarales
along
one
of
the
river
margins
were
playing
cards
anastasio
montanez
looking
on
indifferently
turned
his
black
hairy
face
toward
luis
cervantes
and
leveling
his
kindly
gaze
upon
him
asked
why
so
sad
you
from
the
city
what
are
you
daydreaming
about
come
on
over
here
and
let
have
a
chat
luis
cervantes
did
not
move
anastasio
went
over
to
him
and
sat
down
beside
him
like
a
friend
what
you
need
is
the
excitement
of
the
city
i
wager
you
shine
your
shoes
every
day
and
wear
a
necktie
now
i
may
look
dirty
and
my
clothes
may
be
torn
to
shreds
but
i
not
really
what
i
seem
to
be
i
not
here
because
i
got
to
be
and
do
you
think
so
why
i
own
twenty
oxen
certainly
i
do
ask
my
friend
demetrio
i
cleared
ten
bushels
last
harvest
time
you
see
if
there
one
thing
i
love
riling
these
government
fellows
and
making
them
furious
the
last
scrape
i
had
it
be
eight
months
gone
now
ever
since
i
joined
these
men
i
stuck
my
knife
into
some
captain
he
was
just
a
nobody
a
little
government
squirt
i
pinked
him
here
see
right
under
the
navel
and
that
why
i
here
that
and
because
i
wanted
to
give
my
mate
demetrio
a
hand
christ
the
bloody
little
darling
of
my
life
manteca
shouted
waxing
enthusiastic
over
a
winning
hand
he
placed
a
silver
coin
on
the
jack
of
spades
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
not
much
on
gambling
do
you
want
to
bet
well
come
on
then
i
game
how
do
you
like
the
sound
of
this
leather
snake
jingling
eh
anastasio
shook
his
belt
the
silver
coins
rang
as
he
shook
them
together
meanwhile
pancracio
dealt
the
cards
the
jack
of
spades
turned
up
out
of
the
deck
and
a
quarrel
ensued
altercation
noise
then
shouts
and
at
last
insults
pancracio
brought
his
stony
face
close
to
manteca
who
looked
at
him
with
snake
eyes
convulsive
foaming
at
the
mouth
another
moment
and
they
would
have
been
exchanging
blows
having
completely
exhausted
their
stock
of
direct
insults
they
now
resorted
to
the
most
flowery
and
ornate
insulting
of
each
other
ancestors
male
and
female
paternal
or
maternal
yet
nothing
untoward
occurred
after
their
supply
of
words
was
exhausted
they
gave
over
gambling
and
their
arms
about
each
other
shoulders
marched
off
in
search
of
a
drink
of
alcohol
i
do
like
to
fight
with
my
tongue
either
it
not
decent
right
too
eh
i
tell
you
no
man
living
has
ever
breathed
a
word
to
me
against
my
mother
i
want
to
be
respected
see
that
why
you
never
seen
me
fooling
with
anyone
there
was
a
pause
then
suddenly
look
there
tenderfoot
anastasio
said
changing
his
tone
and
standing
up
with
one
hand
spread
over
his
eyes
what
that
dust
over
there
behind
the
hillock
by
god
what
if
it
those
damned
federals
and
we
sitting
here
doing
nothing
come
on
let
go
and
warn
the
rest
of
the
boys
the
news
met
with
cries
of
joy
ah
we
going
to
meet
them
cried
pancracio
jubilantly
first
among
them
to
rejoice
of
course
we
going
to
meet
them
we
strip
them
clean
of
everything
they
brought
with
them
a
few
moments
later
amid
cries
of
joy
and
a
bustle
of
arms
they
began
saddling
their
horses
but
the
enemy
turned
out
to
be
a
few
burros
and
two
indians
driving
them
forward
stop
them
anyhow
they
must
have
come
from
somewhere
and
probably
news
for
us
demetrio
said
indeed
their
news
proved
sensational
the
federal
troops
had
fortified
the
hills
in
zacatecas
this
was
said
to
be
huerta
last
stronghold
but
everybody
predicted
the
fall
of
the
city
many
families
had
hastily
fled
southward
trains
were
overloaded
with
people
there
was
a
scarcity
of
trucks
and
coaches
hundreds
of
people
walked
along
the
highroad
with
their
belongings
in
a
pack
slung
over
their
shoulders
general
panfilo
natera
was
assembling
his
men
at
fresnillo
the
federals
already
felt
it
was
all
up
with
them
the
fall
of
zacatecas
will
be
huerta
requiescat
in
pace
luis
cervantes
cried
with
unusual
excitement
we
got
to
be
there
before
the
fight
starts
so
that
we
can
join
natera
army
then
suddenly
he
noted
the
surprise
with
which
demetrio
and
his
men
greeted
his
suggestion
crestfallen
he
realized
they
still
considered
him
of
no
account
on
the
morrow
as
the
men
set
off
in
search
of
good
mounts
before
taking
to
the
road
again
demetrio
called
luis
cervantes
do
you
really
want
to
come
with
us
of
course
you
cut
from
another
timber
we
all
know
that
god
knows
why
you
should
like
this
sort
of
life
do
you
imagine
we
in
this
game
because
we
like
it
now
i
like
the
excitement
all
right
but
that
not
all
sit
down
here
right
do
you
want
to
know
why
i
a
rebel
well
i
tell
you
before
the
revolution
i
had
my
land
all
plowed
see
and
just
right
for
sowing
and
if
it
had
been
for
a
little
quarrel
with
don
monico
the
boss
of
my
town
moyahua
i
be
there
in
a
jiffy
getting
the
oxen
ready
for
the
sowing
see
here
there
pancracio
pull
down
two
bottles
of
beer
for
me
and
this
tenderfoot
by
the
holy
cross
drinking
wo
hurt
me
now
will
it
xiii
i
was
born
in
limon
close
by
moyahua
right
in
the
heart
of
the
juchipila
canyon
i
had
my
house
and
my
cows
and
a
patch
of
land
see
i
had
everything
i
wanted
well
i
suppose
you
know
how
we
farmers
make
a
habit
of
going
over
to
town
every
week
to
hear
mass
and
the
sermon
and
then
to
market
to
buy
our
onions
and
tomatoes
and
in
general
everything
they
want
us
to
buy
at
the
ranch
then
you
pick
up
some
friends
and
go
to
primitivo
lopez
saloon
for
a
bit
of
a
drink
before
dinner
well
you
sit
there
drinking
and
you
got
to
be
sociable
so
you
drink
more
than
you
should
and
the
liquor
goes
to
your
head
and
you
laugh
and
you
damned
happy
and
if
you
feel
like
it
you
sing
and
shout
and
kick
up
a
bit
of
a
row
that
quite
all
right
anyhow
for
we
not
doing
anyone
any
harm
but
soon
they
start
bothering
you
and
the
policeman
walks
up
and
down
and
stops
occasionally
with
his
ear
to
the
door
to
put
it
in
a
nutshell
the
chief
of
police
and
his
gang
are
a
lot
of
joykillers
who
decide
they
want
to
put
a
stop
to
your
fun
see
but
by
god
you
got
guts
you
got
red
blood
in
your
veins
and
you
got
a
soul
too
see
so
you
lose
your
temper
you
stand
up
to
them
and
tell
them
to
go
to
the
devil
now
if
they
understand
you
everything
all
right
they
leave
you
alone
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
but
sometimes
they
try
to
talk
you
down
and
hit
you
and
well
you
know
how
it
is
a
and
he
be
damned
if
he
stand
for
someone
ordering
him
around
and
telling
him
what
what
so
before
you
know
it
got
your
knife
out
or
your
gun
leveled
and
then
off
you
go
for
a
wild
run
in
the
sierra
until
they
forgotten
the
corpse
see
all
right
that
just
about
what
happened
to
monico
the
fellow
was
a
greater
bluffer
than
the
rest
he
could
tell
a
rooster
from
a
hen
not
he
well
i
spit
on
his
beard
because
he
would
mind
his
own
business
that
all
there
nothing
else
to
tell
then
just
because
i
did
that
he
had
the
whole
federal
government
against
me
you
must
have
heard
something
about
that
story
in
mexico
city
about
the
killing
of
madero
and
some
other
fellow
felix
or
felipe
diaz
or
something
i
do
know
well
this
man
monico
goes
in
person
to
zacatecas
to
get
an
army
to
capture
me
they
said
that
i
was
a
maderista
and
that
i
was
going
to
rebel
but
a
man
like
me
always
has
friends
somebody
came
and
warned
me
of
what
was
coming
to
me
so
when
the
soldiers
reached
limon
i
was
miles
and
miles
away
trust
me
then
my
compadre
anastasio
who
killed
somebody
came
and
joined
me
and
pancracio
and
quail
and
a
lot
of
friends
and
acquaintances
came
after
him
since
then
we
been
sort
of
collecting
see
you
know
for
yourself
we
get
along
as
best
we
can
for
a
while
both
men
sat
meditating
in
silence
then
look
here
chief
said
luis
cervantes
you
know
that
some
of
natera
men
are
at
juchipila
quite
near
here
i
think
we
should
join
them
before
they
capture
zacatecas
all
we
need
do
is
speak
to
the
general
i
no
good
at
that
sort
of
thing
and
i
do
like
the
idea
of
accepting
orders
from
anybody
very
much
but
you
only
a
handful
of
men
down
here
you
only
be
an
unimportant
chieftain
there
no
argument
about
it
the
revolution
is
bound
to
win
after
it
all
over
they
talk
to
you
just
as
madero
talked
to
all
those
who
had
helped
him
you
very
much
my
friends
you
can
go
home
now
well
that
all
i
want
to
be
let
alone
so
i
can
go
home
wait
a
moment
i
have
finished
madero
said
men
have
made
me
president
of
the
republic
you
have
run
the
risk
of
losing
your
lives
and
leaving
your
wives
and
children
destitute
now
i
have
what
i
wanted
you
can
go
back
to
your
picks
and
shovels
you
can
resume
your
existence
you
can
go
and
hungry
just
as
you
did
before
while
we
your
superiors
will
go
about
trying
to
pile
up
a
few
million
pesos
demetrio
nodded
and
smiling
scratched
his
head
you
said
a
mouthful
louie
venancio
the
barber
put
in
enthusiastically
a
mouthful
as
big
as
a
church
as
i
was
saying
luis
cervantes
resumed
when
the
revolution
is
over
everything
is
over
too
bad
that
so
many
men
have
been
killed
too
bad
there
are
so
many
widows
and
orphans
too
bad
there
was
so
much
bloodshed
of
course
you
are
not
selfish
you
say
to
yourself
i
want
to
do
is
go
back
home
but
i
ask
you
is
it
fair
to
deprive
your
wife
and
kids
of
a
fortune
which
god
himself
places
within
reach
of
your
hand
is
it
fair
to
abandon
your
motherland
in
this
solemn
moment
when
she
most
needs
the
of
her
sons
when
she
most
needs
her
humble
sons
to
save
her
from
falling
again
in
the
clutches
of
her
eternal
oppressors
executioners
and
caciques
you
must
not
forget
that
the
thing
a
man
holds
most
sacred
on
earth
is
his
motherland
macias
smiled
his
eyes
shining
will
it
be
all
right
if
we
go
with
natera
not
only
all
right
venancio
said
insinuatingly
but
i
think
it
absolutely
necessary
now
chief
cervantes
pursued
i
took
a
fancy
to
you
the
first
time
i
laid
eyes
on
you
and
i
like
you
more
and
more
every
day
because
i
realize
what
you
are
worth
please
let
me
be
utterly
frank
you
do
not
yet
realize
your
lofty
noble
function
you
are
a
modest
man
without
ambitions
you
do
not
wish
to
realize
the
exceedingly
important
role
you
are
destined
to
play
in
the
revolution
it
is
not
true
that
you
took
up
arms
simply
because
of
senor
monico
you
are
under
arms
to
protest
against
the
evils
of
all
the
caciques
who
are
overrunning
the
whole
nation
we
are
the
elements
of
a
social
movement
which
will
not
rest
until
it
has
enlarged
the
destinies
of
our
motherland
we
are
the
tools
destiny
makes
use
of
to
reclaim
the
sacred
rights
of
the
people
we
are
not
fighting
to
dethrone
a
miserable
murderer
we
are
fighting
against
tyranny
itself
what
moves
us
is
what
men
call
ideals
our
action
is
what
men
call
fighting
for
a
principle
a
principle
why
villa
and
natera
and
carranza
are
fighting
that
why
we
every
man
of
us
are
fighting
yes
yes
exactly
what
i
been
thinking
myself
said
venancio
in
a
climax
of
enthusiasm
hey
there
pancracio
macias
called
pull
down
two
more
beers
xiv
you
ought
to
see
how
clear
that
fellow
can
make
things
compadre
demetrio
said
all
morning
long
he
had
been
pondering
as
much
of
luis
cervantes
speech
as
he
had
understood
i
heard
him
too
anastasio
answered
people
who
can
read
and
write
get
things
clear
all
right
nothing
was
ever
truer
but
what
i
make
out
is
how
you
going
to
go
and
meet
natera
with
as
few
men
as
we
have
that
nothing
we
going
to
do
things
different
now
they
tell
me
that
as
soon
as
crispin
robles
enters
a
town
he
gets
hold
of
all
the
horses
and
guns
in
the
place
then
he
goes
to
the
jail
and
lets
all
the
jailbirds
out
and
before
you
know
it
he
got
plenty
of
men
all
right
you
see
you
know
i
beginning
to
feel
that
we
have
done
things
right
so
far
it
do
seem
right
somehow
that
this
city
guy
should
be
able
to
tell
us
what
to
do
ai
it
wonderful
to
be
able
to
read
and
write
they
both
sighed
sadly
luis
cervantes
came
in
with
several
others
to
find
out
the
day
of
their
departure
we
leaving
no
later
than
tomorrow
said
demetrio
without
hesitation
quail
suggested
that
musicians
be
summoned
from
the
neighboring
hamlet
and
that
a
farewell
dance
be
given
his
idea
met
with
enthusiasm
on
all
sides
we
go
then
pancracio
shouted
but
i
certainly
going
in
good
company
this
time
my
sweetheart
coming
along
with
me
demetrio
replied
that
he
too
would
willingly
take
along
a
girl
he
had
set
his
eye
on
but
that
he
hoped
none
of
his
men
would
leave
bitter
memories
behind
them
as
the
federals
did
you
wo
have
long
to
wait
everything
will
be
arranged
when
you
return
luis
cervantes
whispered
to
him
what
do
you
mean
demetrio
asked
i
thought
that
you
and
camilla
there
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
chief
she
likes
you
but
afraid
of
you
that
all
really
is
that
really
true
yes
but
i
think
you
quite
right
in
not
wanting
to
leave
any
bitter
feelings
behind
you
as
you
go
when
you
come
back
as
a
conqueror
everything
will
be
different
they
all
thank
you
for
it
even
by
god
you
certainly
a
shrewd
one
demetrio
replied
patting
him
on
the
back
at
sundown
camilla
went
to
the
river
to
fetch
water
as
usual
luis
cervantes
walking
down
the
same
trail
met
her
camilla
felt
her
heart
leap
to
her
mouth
but
without
taking
the
slightest
notice
of
her
luis
cervantes
hastily
took
one
of
the
turns
and
disappeared
among
the
rocks
at
this
hour
as
usual
the
calcinated
rocks
the
branches
and
the
dry
weeds
faded
into
the
of
the
shadows
the
wind
blew
softly
the
green
lances
of
the
young
corn
leaves
rustling
in
the
twilight
nothing
was
changed
all
nature
was
as
she
had
found
it
before
evening
upon
evening
but
in
the
stones
and
the
dry
weeds
amid
the
fragrance
of
the
air
and
the
light
whir
of
falling
leaves
camilla
sensed
a
new
strangeness
a
vast
desolation
in
everything
about
her
rounding
a
huge
eroded
rock
suddenly
camilla
found
herself
face
to
face
with
luis
who
was
seated
on
a
stone
hatless
his
legs
dangling
listen
you
might
come
down
here
to
say
luis
cervantes
was
obliging
enough
he
jumped
down
and
joined
her
you
proud
ai
you
have
i
been
so
mean
that
you
do
even
want
to
talk
to
me
why
do
you
say
that
camilla
you
been
extremely
kind
to
me
why
you
been
more
than
a
friend
you
taken
care
of
me
as
if
you
were
my
sister
now
i
about
to
leave
i
very
grateful
to
you
always
remember
you
liar
camilla
said
her
face
transfigured
with
joy
suppose
i
come
after
you
i
intended
to
say
to
you
at
the
dance
this
evening
what
dance
if
there
a
dance
i
not
go
to
it
why
not
because
i
ca
stand
that
horrible
man
demetrio
do
be
silly
child
said
luis
he
really
very
fond
of
you
do
go
and
throw
away
this
opportunity
you
never
have
one
like
it
again
in
your
life
do
you
know
that
demetrio
is
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
general
you
silly
girl
he
be
a
very
wealthy
man
with
horses
galore
and
you
have
jewels
and
clothes
and
a
fine
house
and
a
lot
of
money
to
spend
just
imagine
what
a
life
you
would
lead
with
him
camilla
stared
up
at
the
blue
sky
so
he
should
not
read
the
expression
in
her
eyes
a
dead
leaf
shook
slowly
loose
from
the
crest
of
a
tree
swinging
slowly
on
the
wind
fell
like
a
small
dead
butterfly
at
her
feet
she
bent
down
and
took
it
in
her
fingers
then
without
looking
at
him
she
murmured
it
horrible
to
hear
you
talk
like
that
i
like
you
no
one
else
ah
well
go
then
go
i
feel
ashamed
now
please
leave
me
she
threw
away
the
leaf
she
had
crumpled
in
her
hand
and
covered
her
face
with
a
corner
of
her
apron
when
she
opened
her
eyes
luis
cervantes
had
disappeared
she
followed
the
river
trail
the
river
seemed
to
have
been
sprinkled
with
a
fine
red
dust
on
its
surface
drifted
now
a
sky
of
variegated
colors
now
the
dark
crags
half
light
half
shadow
myriads
of
luminous
insects
twinkled
in
a
hollow
camilla
standing
on
the
beach
of
washed
round
stones
caught
a
reflection
of
herself
in
the
waters
she
saw
herself
in
her
yellow
blouse
with
the
green
ribbons
her
white
skirt
her
carefully
combed
hair
her
wide
eyebrows
and
broad
forehead
exactly
as
she
had
dressed
to
please
luis
she
burst
into
tears
among
the
reeds
the
frogs
chanted
the
implacable
melancholy
of
the
hour
perched
on
a
dry
root
a
dove
wept
also
xv
that
evening
there
was
much
merrymaking
at
the
dance
and
a
great
quantity
of
mezcal
was
drunk
i
miss
camilla
said
demetrio
in
a
loud
voice
everybody
looked
about
for
camilla
she
sick
she
got
a
headache
said
agapita
harshly
uneasy
as
she
caught
sight
of
the
malicious
glances
leveled
at
her
when
the
dance
was
over
demetrio
somewhat
unsteady
on
his
feet
thanked
all
the
kind
neighbors
who
had
welcomed
them
and
promised
that
when
the
revolution
had
triumphed
he
would
remember
them
one
and
all
because
hospital
or
jail
is
a
true
test
of
friendship
may
god
hand
lead
you
all
said
an
old
woman
god
bless
you
all
and
keep
you
well
others
added
utterly
drunk
maria
antonia
said
come
back
soon
damn
soon
on
the
morrow
maria
antonia
who
though
she
was
pockmarked
and
walleyed
nevertheless
enjoyed
a
notorious
reputation
indeed
it
was
confidently
proclaimed
that
no
man
had
failed
to
go
with
her
behind
the
river
weeds
at
some
time
or
other
shouted
to
camilla
hey
there
you
what
the
matter
what
are
you
doing
there
skulking
in
the
corner
with
a
shawl
tied
round
your
head
you
crying
i
wager
look
at
her
eyes
they
look
like
a
witch
there
no
sorrow
lasts
more
than
three
days
agapita
knitted
her
eyebrows
and
muttered
indistinctly
to
herself
the
old
crones
felt
uneasy
and
lonesome
since
demetrio
men
had
left
the
men
too
in
spite
of
their
gossip
and
insults
lamented
their
departure
since
now
they
would
have
no
one
to
bring
them
fresh
meat
every
day
it
is
pleasant
indeed
to
spend
your
time
eating
and
drinking
and
sleeping
all
day
long
in
the
cool
shade
of
the
rocks
while
clouds
ravel
and
unravel
their
fleecy
threads
on
the
blue
shuttle
of
the
sky
look
at
them
again
there
they
go
maria
antonia
yelled
why
they
look
like
toys
demetrio
men
riding
their
thin
nags
could
still
be
descried
in
the
distance
against
the
sapphire
translucence
of
the
sky
where
the
broken
rocks
and
the
chaparral
melted
into
a
single
bluish
smooth
surface
across
the
air
a
gust
of
hot
wind
bore
the
broken
faltering
strains
of
la
adelita
the
revolutionary
song
to
the
settlement
camilla
who
had
come
out
when
maria
antonia
shouted
could
no
longer
control
herself
she
dived
back
into
her
hut
unable
to
restrain
her
tears
and
moaning
maria
antonia
burst
into
laughter
and
moved
off
they
cast
the
evil
eye
on
my
daughter
agapita
said
in
perplexity
she
pondered
a
while
then
duly
reached
a
decision
from
a
pole
in
the
hut
she
took
down
a
piece
of
strong
leather
which
her
husband
used
to
hitch
up
the
yoke
this
pole
stood
between
a
picture
of
christ
and
one
of
the
virgin
agapita
promptly
twisted
the
leather
and
proceeded
to
administer
a
sound
thrashing
to
camilla
in
order
to
dispel
the
evil
spirits
riding
proudly
on
his
horse
demetrio
felt
like
a
new
man
his
eyes
recovered
their
peculiar
metallic
brilliance
and
the
blood
flowed
red
and
warm
through
his
coppery
aztec
cheeks
the
men
threw
out
their
chests
as
if
to
breathe
the
widening
horizon
the
immensity
of
the
sky
the
blue
from
the
mountains
and
the
fresh
air
redolent
with
the
various
odors
of
the
sierra
they
spurred
their
horses
to
a
gallop
as
if
in
that
mad
race
they
laid
claims
of
possession
to
the
earth
what
man
among
them
now
remembered
the
stern
chief
of
police
the
growling
policeman
or
the
conceited
cacique
what
man
remembered
his
pitiful
hut
where
he
slaved
away
always
under
the
eyes
of
the
owner
or
the
ruthless
and
sullen
foreman
always
forced
to
rise
before
dawn
and
to
take
up
his
shovel
basket
or
goad
wearing
himself
out
to
earn
a
mere
pitcher
of
atole
and
a
handful
of
beans
they
laughed
they
sang
they
whistled
drunk
with
the
sunlight
the
air
of
the
open
spaces
the
wine
of
life
meco
prancing
forward
on
his
horse
bared
his
white
glistening
teeth
joking
and
kicking
up
like
a
clown
hey
pancracio
he
asked
with
utmost
seriousness
my
wife
writes
me
i
got
another
kid
how
in
hell
is
that
i
ai
seen
her
since
madero
was
president
that
nothing
the
other
replied
you
just
left
her
a
lot
of
eggs
to
hatch
for
you
they
all
laughed
uproariously
only
meco
grave
and
aloof
sang
in
a
voice
horribly
shrill
i
gave
her
a
penny
that
was
enough
i
gave
her
a
nickel
the
wench
wanted
more
we
bargained
i
asked
if
a
dime
was
enough
but
she
wanted
a
quarter
by
god
that
was
tough
all
wenches
are
fickle
and
trumpery
stuff
the
sun
beating
down
upon
them
dulled
their
minds
and
bodies
and
presently
they
were
silent
all
day
long
they
rode
through
the
canyon
up
and
down
the
steep
round
hills
dirty
and
bald
as
a
man
head
hill
after
hill
in
endless
succession
at
last
late
in
the
afternoon
they
descried
several
stone
church
towers
in
the
heart
of
a
bluish
ridge
and
beyond
the
white
road
with
its
curling
spirals
of
dust
and
its
gray
telegraph
poles
they
advanced
toward
the
main
road
in
the
distance
they
spied
a
figure
of
an
indian
sitting
on
the
embankment
they
drew
up
to
him
he
proved
to
be
an
unfriendly
looking
old
man
clad
in
rags
he
was
laboriously
attempting
to
mend
his
leather
sandals
with
the
help
of
a
dull
knife
a
burro
loaded
with
fresh
green
grass
stood
by
demetrio
accosted
him
what
are
you
doing
grandpa
gathering
alfalfa
for
my
cow
how
many
federals
are
there
around
here
just
a
few
not
more
than
a
dozen
i
reckon
the
old
man
grew
communicative
he
told
them
of
many
important
rumors
obregon
was
besieging
guadalajara
torres
was
in
complete
control
of
the
potosi
region
natera
ruled
over
fresnillo
all
right
said
demetrio
you
can
go
where
you
headed
for
see
but
you
be
damn
careful
not
to
tell
anyone
you
saw
us
because
if
you
do
i
pump
you
full
of
lead
and
i
could
track
you
down
even
if
you
tried
to
hide
in
the
pit
of
hell
see
what
do
you
say
boys
demetrio
asked
them
as
soon
as
the
old
man
had
disappeared
to
hell
with
the
mochos
we
kill
every
blasted
one
of
them
they
cried
in
unison
then
they
set
to
counting
their
cartridges
and
the
hand
grenades
the
owl
had
made
out
of
fragments
of
iron
tubing
and
metal
bed
handles
not
much
to
brag
about
but
we
soon
trade
them
for
rifles
anastasio
observed
anxiously
they
pressed
forward
spurring
the
thin
flanks
of
their
nags
to
a
gallop
demetrio
brisk
imperious
tones
of
order
brought
them
abruptly
to
a
halt
they
dismounted
by
the
side
of
a
hill
protected
by
thick
huizache
trees
without
unsaddling
their
horses
each
began
to
search
for
stones
to
serve
as
pillows
xvi
at
midnight
demetrio
macias
ordered
the
march
to
be
resumed
the
town
was
five
or
six
miles
away
the
best
plan
was
to
take
the
soldiers
by
surprise
before
reveille
the
sky
was
cloudy
with
here
and
there
a
star
shining
from
time
to
time
a
flash
of
lightning
crossed
the
sky
with
a
red
dart
illumining
the
far
horizon
luis
cervantes
asked
demetrio
whether
the
success
of
the
attack
might
not
be
better
served
by
procuring
a
guide
or
leastways
by
ascertaining
the
topographic
conditions
of
the
town
and
the
precise
location
of
the
soldiers
quarters
no
demetrio
answered
accompanying
his
smile
with
a
disdainful
gesture
we
simply
fall
on
them
when
they
least
expect
it
all
there
is
to
it
see
we
done
it
before
all
right
lots
of
times
have
you
ever
seen
the
squirrels
stick
their
heads
out
of
their
holes
when
you
poured
in
water
well
that
how
these
lousy
soldiers
are
going
to
feel
do
you
see
they
be
frightened
out
of
their
wits
the
moment
they
hear
our
first
shot
then
they
slink
out
and
stand
as
targets
for
us
suppose
the
old
man
we
met
yesterday
lied
to
us
suppose
there
are
fifty
soldiers
instead
of
twenty
who
knows
but
he
a
spy
sent
out
by
the
federals
ha
tenderfoot
frightened
already
eh
anastasio
montanez
mocked
sure
handling
a
rifle
and
messing
about
with
bandages
are
two
different
things
pancracio
observed
well
that
enough
talk
i
guess
said
meco
all
we
have
to
do
is
fight
a
dozen
frightened
rats
this
fight
wo
convince
our
mothers
that
they
gave
birth
to
men
or
whatever
the
hell
you
like
manteca
added
when
they
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
town
venancio
walked
ahead
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
a
hut
where
the
soldiers
barracks
he
inquired
of
a
man
who
came
out
barefoot
a
ragged
serape
covering
his
body
right
there
just
beyond
the
plaza
he
answered
since
nobody
knew
where
the
city
square
was
venancio
made
him
walk
ahead
to
show
the
way
trembling
with
fear
the
poor
devil
told
them
they
were
doing
him
a
terrible
wrong
i
just
a
poor
day
laborer
sir
i
got
a
wife
and
a
lot
of
kids
what
the
hell
do
you
think
i
have
dogs
demetrio
scowled
i
got
kids
too
see
then
he
commanded
you
men
keep
quiet
not
a
sound
out
of
you
and
walk
down
the
middle
of
the
street
single
file
the
rectangular
church
cupola
rose
above
the
small
houses
here
gentlemen
there
the
plaza
beyond
the
church
just
walk
a
bit
further
and
there
the
barracks
he
knelt
down
then
imploring
them
to
let
him
go
but
pancracio
without
pausing
to
reply
struck
him
across
the
chest
with
his
rifle
and
ordered
him
to
proceed
how
many
soldiers
are
there
luis
cervantes
asked
i
do
want
to
lie
to
you
boss
but
to
tell
you
the
truth
yes
sir
to
tell
you
god
truth
there
a
lot
of
them
a
whole
lot
of
luis
cervantes
turned
around
to
stare
at
demetrio
who
feigned
momentary
deafness
they
were
soon
in
the
city
square
a
loud
volley
of
rifle
shots
rang
out
deafening
them
demetrio
horse
reared
staggered
on
its
hind
legs
bent
its
forelegs
and
fell
to
the
ground
kicking
the
owl
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
fell
from
his
horse
which
rushed
madly
to
the
center
of
the
square
another
volley
the
guide
threw
up
his
arms
and
fell
on
his
back
without
a
sound
with
all
haste
anastasio
montanez
helped
demetrio
up
behind
him
on
his
horse
the
others
retreated
seeking
shelter
along
the
walls
of
the
houses
hey
men
said
a
workman
sticking
his
head
out
of
a
large
door
go
for
through
the
back
of
the
chapel
they
all
in
there
cut
back
through
this
street
then
turn
to
the
left
you
reach
an
alley
keep
on
going
ahead
until
you
hit
the
chapel
as
he
spoke
a
fresh
volley
of
pistol
shots
directed
from
the
neighboring
roofs
fell
like
a
rain
about
them
by
god
the
man
said
those
ai
poisonous
spiders
they
only
townsmen
scared
of
their
own
shadow
come
in
here
until
they
stop
how
many
of
them
are
there
asked
demetrio
there
were
only
twelve
of
them
but
last
night
they
were
scared
out
of
their
wits
so
they
wired
to
the
town
beyond
for
help
i
do
know
how
many
of
them
there
are
now
even
if
there
are
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
them
it
does
cut
any
ice
most
of
them
are
soldiers
you
know
but
drafted
men
if
just
one
of
them
starts
mutinying
the
rest
will
follow
like
sheep
my
brother
was
drafted
they
got
him
there
i
go
along
with
you
and
signal
to
him
all
of
them
will
desert
and
follow
you
then
we
only
have
the
officers
to
deal
with
if
you
want
to
give
me
a
gun
or
something
no
more
rifles
left
brother
but
i
guess
you
can
put
these
to
some
use
anastasio
montanez
said
passing
him
two
hand
grenades
the
officer
in
command
of
the
federals
was
a
young
coxcomb
of
a
captain
with
a
waxed
mustache
and
blond
hair
as
long
as
he
felt
uncertain
about
the
strength
of
the
assailants
he
had
remained
extremely
quiet
and
prudent
but
now
that
they
had
driven
the
rebels
back
without
allowing
them
a
chance
to
fire
a
single
shot
he
waxed
bold
and
brave
while
the
soldiers
did
not
dare
put
out
their
heads
beyond
the
pillars
of
the
building
his
own
shadow
stood
against
the
pale
clear
dawn
exhibiting
his
slender
body
and
his
officer
cape
bellying
in
the
breeze
ha
i
remember
our
coup
his
military
career
had
consisted
of
the
single
adventure
when
together
with
other
students
of
the
officers
school
he
was
involved
in
the
treacherous
revolt
of
feliz
diaz
and
huerta
against
president
madero
whenever
the
slightest
insubordination
arose
he
invariably
recalled
his
feat
at
the
ciudadela
lieutenant
campos
he
ordered
emphatically
take
a
dozen
men
and
wipe
out
the
bandits
hiding
there
the
curs
they
only
brave
when
it
comes
to
guzzling
meat
and
robbing
a
hencoop
a
workingman
appeared
at
the
small
door
of
the
spiral
staircase
announcing
that
the
assailants
were
hidden
in
a
corral
where
they
might
easily
be
captured
this
message
came
from
the
citizens
keeping
watch
on
housetops
i
go
myself
and
get
it
over
with
the
officer
declared
impetuously
but
he
soon
changed
his
mind
before
he
had
reached
the
door
he
retraced
his
steps
very
likely
they
are
waiting
for
more
men
and
of
course
it
would
be
wrong
for
me
to
abandon
my
post
lieutenant
campos
go
there
yourself
and
capture
them
dead
or
alive
we
shoot
them
at
noon
when
everybody
coming
out
of
church
those
bandits
will
see
the
example
i
set
around
here
but
if
you
ca
capture
them
lieutenant
kill
them
all
do
leave
a
man
of
them
alive
do
you
understand
in
high
good
humor
he
began
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
formulating
the
official
despatch
he
would
send
off
no
later
than
today
to
his
honor
the
minister
for
war
general
blanquet
mexico
city
sir
i
have
the
honor
to
inform
your
excellency
that
on
the
morning
of
a
rebel
army
five
hundred
strong
commanded
by
attacked
this
town
which
i
am
charged
to
defend
with
such
speed
as
the
gravity
of
the
situation
called
for
i
fortified
my
post
in
the
town
the
battle
lasted
two
hours
despite
the
superiority
of
the
enemy
in
men
and
equipment
i
was
able
to
defeat
and
rout
them
their
casualties
were
twenty
killed
and
a
far
greater
number
of
wounded
judging
from
the
trails
of
blood
they
left
behind
them
as
they
retreated
i
am
pleased
to
state
there
was
no
casualty
on
our
side
i
have
the
honor
to
congratulate
your
excellency
upon
this
new
triumph
for
the
federal
arms
viva
presidente
huerta
viva
mexico
well
the
young
captain
mused
i
be
promoted
to
major
he
clasped
his
hands
together
jubilant
at
this
precise
moment
a
detonation
rang
out
his
ears
buzzed
he
xvii
if
we
get
through
the
corral
we
can
make
the
alley
eh
demetrio
asked
that
right
the
workman
answered
beyond
the
corral
there
a
house
then
another
corral
then
there
a
store
demetrio
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
this
time
his
decision
was
immediate
can
you
get
hold
of
a
crowbar
or
something
like
that
to
make
a
hole
through
the
wall
yes
we
get
anything
you
want
but
but
what
where
can
we
get
a
crowbar
everything
is
right
there
but
it
all
belongs
to
the
boss
without
further
ado
demetrio
strode
into
the
shed
which
had
been
pointed
out
as
the
toolhouse
it
was
all
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
once
in
the
alley
hugging
to
the
walls
they
marched
forward
in
single
file
until
they
reached
the
rear
of
the
church
now
they
had
but
a
single
fence
and
the
rear
wall
of
the
chapel
to
scale
god
will
be
done
demetrio
said
to
himself
he
was
the
first
to
clamber
over
like
monkeys
the
others
followed
him
reaching
the
other
side
with
bleeding
grimy
hands
the
rest
was
easy
the
deep
worn
steps
along
the
stonework
made
their
ascent
of
the
chapel
wall
swifter
the
church
vault
hid
them
from
the
soldiers
wait
a
moment
will
you
said
the
workman
i
go
and
see
where
my
brother
is
i
let
you
know
and
then
you
get
at
the
officers
but
no
one
paid
the
slightest
attention
to
him
for
a
second
demetrio
glanced
at
the
soldiers
black
coats
hanging
on
the
wall
then
at
his
own
men
thick
on
the
church
tower
behind
the
iron
rail
he
smiled
with
satisfaction
and
turning
to
his
men
said
come
on
now
boys
twenty
bombs
exploded
simultaneously
in
the
midst
of
the
soldiers
who
awaking
terrified
out
of
their
sleep
started
up
their
eyes
wide
open
but
before
they
had
realized
their
plight
twenty
more
bombs
burst
like
thunder
upon
them
leaving
a
scattering
of
men
killed
or
maimed
do
do
that
yet
for
god
sake
do
do
it
till
i
find
my
brother
the
workman
implored
in
anguish
in
vain
an
old
sergeant
harangued
the
soldiers
insulting
them
in
the
hope
of
rallying
them
for
they
were
rats
caught
in
a
trap
no
more
no
less
some
of
the
soldiers
attempting
to
reach
the
small
door
by
the
staircase
fell
to
the
ground
pierced
by
demetrio
shots
others
fell
at
the
feet
of
these
specters
with
faces
and
breasts
dark
as
iron
clad
in
long
torn
trousers
of
white
cloth
which
fell
to
their
leather
sandals
scattering
death
and
destruction
below
them
in
the
belfry
a
few
men
struggled
to
emerge
from
the
pile
of
dead
who
had
fallen
upon
them
it
awful
chief
luis
cervantes
cried
in
alarm
we
no
more
bombs
left
and
we
left
our
guns
in
the
corral
smiling
demetrio
drew
out
a
large
shining
knife
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
steel
flashed
in
every
hand
some
knives
were
large
and
pointed
others
wide
as
the
palm
of
a
hand
others
heavy
as
bayonets
the
spy
luis
cervantes
cried
triumphantly
did
i
tell
you
do
kill
me
chief
please
do
kill
me
the
old
sergeant
implored
squirming
at
the
feet
of
demetrio
who
stood
over
him
knife
in
hand
the
victim
raised
his
wrinkled
indian
face
there
was
not
a
single
gray
hair
in
his
head
today
demetrio
recognized
the
spy
who
had
lied
to
him
the
day
before
terrified
luis
cervantes
quickly
averted
his
face
the
steel
blade
went
crack
crack
on
the
old
man
ribs
he
toppled
backward
his
arms
spread
his
eyes
ghastly
do
kill
my
brother
do
kill
him
he
my
brother
the
workman
shouted
in
terror
to
pancracio
who
was
pursuing
a
soldier
but
it
was
too
late
with
one
thrust
pancracio
had
cut
his
neck
in
half
and
two
streams
of
scarlet
spurted
from
the
wound
kill
the
soldiers
kill
them
all
pancracio
and
manteca
surpassed
the
others
in
the
savagery
of
their
slaughter
and
finished
up
with
the
wounded
montanez
exhausted
let
his
arm
fall
it
hung
limp
to
his
side
a
gentle
expression
still
filled
his
glance
his
eyes
shone
he
was
naive
as
a
child
unmoral
as
a
hyena
here
one
who
not
dead
yet
quail
shouted
pancracio
ran
up
the
little
blond
captain
with
curled
mustache
turned
pale
as
wax
he
stood
against
the
door
to
the
staircase
unable
to
muster
enough
strength
to
take
another
step
pancracio
pushed
him
brutally
to
the
edge
of
the
corridor
a
jab
with
his
knee
against
the
captain
thigh
then
a
sound
not
unlike
a
bag
of
stones
falling
from
the
top
of
the
steeple
on
the
porch
of
the
church
my
god
you
got
no
brains
said
quail
if
i
known
what
you
were
doing
i
have
kept
him
for
myself
that
was
a
fine
pair
of
shoes
you
lost
bending
over
them
the
rebels
stripped
those
among
the
soldiers
who
were
best
clad
laughing
and
joking
as
they
despoiled
them
brushing
back
his
long
hair
that
had
fallen
over
his
sweating
forehead
and
covered
his
eyes
demetrio
said
now
let
get
those
city
fellows
xviii
on
the
day
general
natera
began
his
advance
against
the
town
of
zacatecas
demetrio
with
a
hundred
men
went
to
meet
him
at
fresnillo
the
leader
received
him
cordially
i
know
who
you
are
and
the
sort
of
men
you
bring
i
heard
about
the
beatings
you
gave
the
federals
from
tepic
to
durango
natera
shook
hands
with
demetrio
effusively
while
luis
cervantes
said
with
men
like
general
natera
and
colonel
demetrio
macias
we
cover
our
country
with
glory
demetrio
understood
the
purpose
of
those
words
after
natera
had
repeatedly
addressed
him
as
colonel
wine
and
beer
were
served
demetrio
and
natera
drank
many
a
toast
luis
cervantes
proposed
the
triumph
of
our
cause
which
is
the
sublime
triumph
of
justice
because
our
ideal
to
free
the
noble
people
of
mexico
is
about
to
be
realized
and
because
those
men
who
have
watered
the
earth
with
their
blood
and
tears
will
reap
the
harvest
which
is
rightfully
theirs
natera
fixed
his
cruel
gaze
on
the
orator
then
turned
his
back
on
him
to
talk
to
demetrio
presently
one
of
natera
officers
a
young
man
with
a
frank
open
face
drew
up
to
the
table
and
stared
insistently
at
cervantes
are
you
luis
cervantes
yes
you
solis
eh
the
moment
you
entered
i
thought
i
recognized
you
well
well
even
now
i
can
hardly
believe
my
eyes
it
true
enough
well
but
look
here
let
have
a
drink
come
along
then
hm
solis
went
on
offering
cervantes
a
chair
since
when
have
you
turned
rebel
i
been
a
rebel
the
last
two
months
oh
i
see
that
why
you
speak
with
such
faith
and
enthusiasm
about
things
we
all
felt
when
we
joined
the
revolution
have
you
lost
your
faith
or
enthusiasm
look
here
man
do
be
surprised
if
i
confide
in
you
right
off
i
am
so
anxious
to
find
someone
intelligent
among
this
crowd
that
as
soon
as
i
get
hold
of
a
man
like
you
i
clutch
at
him
as
eagerly
as
i
would
at
a
glass
of
water
after
walking
mile
after
mile
through
a
parched
desert
but
frankly
i
think
you
should
do
the
explaining
first
i
ca
understand
how
a
man
who
was
correspondent
of
a
government
newspaper
during
the
madero
regime
and
later
editorial
writer
on
a
conservative
journal
who
denounced
us
as
bandits
in
the
most
fiery
articles
is
now
fighting
on
our
side
i
tell
you
honestly
i
have
been
converted
cervantes
answered
are
you
absolutely
convinced
solis
sighed
filled
the
glasses
they
drank
what
about
you
are
you
tired
of
the
revolution
asked
cervantes
sharply
tired
my
dear
fellow
i
years
old
and
i
fit
as
a
fiddle
but
am
i
disappointed
perhaps
you
must
have
sound
reasons
for
feeling
that
way
i
hoped
to
find
a
meadow
at
the
end
of
the
road
i
found
a
swamp
facts
are
bitter
so
are
men
that
bitterness
eats
your
heart
out
it
is
poison
dry
rot
enthusiasm
hope
ideals
dreams
vain
dreams
when
that
over
you
have
a
choice
either
you
turn
bandit
like
the
rest
or
the
timeservers
will
swamp
you
cervantes
writhed
at
his
friend
words
his
argument
was
quite
out
of
place
painful
to
avoid
being
forced
to
take
issue
he
invited
solis
to
cite
the
circumstances
that
had
destroyed
his
illusions
circumstances
no
it
far
less
important
than
that
it
a
host
of
silly
insignificant
things
that
no
one
notices
except
yourself
a
change
of
expression
eyes
curled
in
a
deep
import
of
a
phrase
that
is
lost
yet
take
these
things
together
and
they
compose
the
mask
of
our
race
terrible
grotesque
a
race
that
awaits
redemption
he
drained
another
glass
after
a
long
pause
he
continued
you
ask
me
why
i
am
still
a
rebel
well
the
revolution
is
like
a
hurricane
if
you
in
it
you
not
a
man
you
a
leaf
a
dead
leaf
blown
by
the
wind
demetrio
reappeared
seeing
him
solis
relapsed
into
silence
come
along
demetrio
said
to
cervantes
come
with
me
unctuously
solis
congratulated
demetrio
on
the
feats
that
had
won
him
fame
and
the
notice
of
pancho
villa
northern
division
demetrio
warmed
to
his
praise
gratefully
he
heard
his
prowess
vaunted
though
at
times
he
found
it
difficult
to
believe
he
was
the
hero
of
the
exploits
the
other
narrated
but
solis
story
proved
so
charming
so
convincing
that
before
long
he
found
himself
repeating
it
as
gospel
truth
natera
is
a
genius
luis
cervantes
said
when
they
had
returned
to
the
hotel
but
captain
solis
is
a
nobody
a
timeserver
demetrio
macias
was
too
elated
to
listen
to
him
i
a
colonel
my
lad
and
you
my
secretary
demetrio
men
made
many
acquaintances
that
evening
much
liquor
flowed
to
celebrate
new
friendships
of
course
men
are
not
necessarily
even
tempered
nor
is
alcohol
a
good
counselor
quarrels
naturally
ensued
yet
many
differences
that
occurred
were
smoothed
out
in
a
friendly
spirit
outside
the
saloons
restaurants
or
brothels
on
the
morrow
casualties
were
reported
always
a
few
dead
an
old
prostitute
was
found
with
a
bullet
through
her
stomach
two
of
colonel
macias
new
men
lay
in
the
gutter
slit
from
ear
to
ear
anastasio
montanez
carried
an
account
of
the
events
to
his
chief
demetrio
shrugged
his
shoulders
bury
them
he
said
xix
they
coming
back
it
was
with
amazement
that
the
inhabitants
of
fresnillo
learned
that
the
rebel
attack
on
zacatecas
had
failed
completely
they
coming
back
the
rebels
were
a
maddened
mob
sunburnt
filthy
naked
their
high
straw
hats
hid
their
faces
the
high
hats
came
back
as
happily
as
they
had
marched
forth
a
few
days
before
pillaging
every
hamlet
along
the
road
every
ranch
even
the
poorest
hut
who
buy
this
thing
one
of
them
asked
he
had
carried
his
spoils
long
he
was
tired
the
sheen
of
the
nickel
on
the
typewriter
a
new
machine
attracted
every
glance
five
times
that
morning
the
oliver
had
changed
hands
the
first
sale
netted
the
owner
ten
pesos
presently
it
had
sold
for
eight
each
time
it
changed
hands
it
was
two
pesos
cheaper
to
be
sure
it
was
a
heavy
burden
nobody
could
carry
it
for
more
than
a
i
give
you
a
quarter
for
it
quail
said
yours
cried
the
owner
handing
it
over
quickly
as
though
he
feared
quail
might
change
his
mind
thus
for
the
sum
of
cents
quail
was
afforded
the
pleasure
of
taking
it
in
his
hands
and
throwing
it
with
all
his
might
against
the
wall
it
struck
with
a
crash
this
gave
the
signal
to
all
who
carried
any
cumbersome
objects
to
get
rid
of
them
by
smashing
them
against
the
rocks
objects
of
all
sorts
crystal
china
faience
porcelain
flew
through
the
air
heavy
plated
mirrors
brass
candlesticks
fragile
delicate
statues
chinese
vases
any
object
not
readily
convertible
into
cash
fell
by
the
wayside
in
fragments
demetrio
did
not
share
the
untoward
exaltation
after
all
they
were
retreating
defeated
he
called
montanez
and
pancracio
aside
and
said
these
fellows
have
no
guts
it
not
so
hard
to
take
a
town
it
like
this
first
you
open
up
this
way
he
sketched
a
vast
gesture
spreading
his
powerful
arms
then
you
get
close
to
them
like
this
he
brought
his
arms
together
slowly
then
slam
bang
whack
crash
he
beat
his
hands
against
his
chest
anastasio
and
pancracio
convinced
by
this
simple
lucid
explanation
answered
that
god
truth
they
no
guts
that
the
trouble
with
them
demetrio
men
camped
in
a
corral
do
you
remember
camilla
demetrio
asked
with
a
sigh
as
he
settled
on
his
back
on
the
manure
pile
where
the
rest
were
already
stretched
out
camilla
what
girl
do
you
mean
demetrio
the
girl
that
used
to
feed
me
up
there
at
the
ranch
anastasio
made
a
gesture
implying
i
do
care
a
damn
about
the
women
camilla
or
anyone
else
i
not
forgotten
demetrio
went
on
drawing
on
his
cigarette
yes
i
was
feeling
like
hell
i
just
finished
drinking
a
glass
of
water
god
but
it
was
cool
you
want
any
more
she
asked
me
i
was
half
dead
with
fever
and
all
the
time
i
saw
that
glass
of
water
blue
so
blue
and
i
heard
her
little
voice
you
want
any
more
that
voice
tinkled
in
my
ears
like
a
silver
well
pancracio
what
about
it
shall
we
go
back
to
the
ranch
demetrio
we
friends
are
we
well
then
listen
you
may
not
believe
it
but
i
had
a
lot
of
experience
with
women
women
christ
they
all
right
for
a
while
granted
though
even
that
going
pretty
far
demetrio
you
should
see
the
scars
they
given
me
all
over
my
body
not
to
speak
of
my
soul
to
hell
with
women
they
the
devil
that
what
they
are
you
may
have
noticed
i
steer
clear
of
them
you
know
why
and
do
think
i
do
know
what
i
talking
about
i
had
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
experience
and
that
no
lie
what
do
you
say
pancracio
when
are
we
going
back
to
the
ranch
demetrio
insisted
blowing
gray
clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
into
the
air
say
the
day
i
game
you
know
i
left
my
woman
there
too
your
woman
hell
quail
said
disgruntled
and
sleepy
all
right
then
our
woman
it
a
good
thing
you
kindhearted
so
we
all
can
enjoy
her
when
you
bring
her
over
manteca
murmured
that
right
pancracio
bring
maria
antonia
we
all
getting
pretty
cold
around
here
meco
shouted
from
a
distance
the
crowd
broke
into
peals
of
laughter
pancracio
and
manteca
vied
with
each
other
in
calling
forth
oaths
and
obscenity
xx
villa
is
coming
the
news
spread
like
lightning
villa
the
magic
word
the
great
man
the
salient
profile
the
unconquerable
warrior
who
even
at
a
distance
exerts
the
fascination
of
a
reptile
a
boa
constrictor
our
mexican
napoleon
exclaimed
luis
cervantes
yes
the
aztec
eagle
he
buried
his
beak
of
steel
in
the
head
of
huerta
the
serpent
solis
natera
chief
of
staff
remarked
somewhat
ironically
adding
at
least
that
how
i
expressed
it
in
a
speech
i
made
at
ciudad
juarez
the
two
sat
at
the
bar
of
the
saloon
drinking
beer
the
high
hats
wearing
mufflers
around
their
necks
and
thick
rough
leather
shoes
on
their
feet
ate
and
drank
endlessly
their
gnarled
hands
loomed
across
table
across
bar
all
their
talk
was
of
villa
and
his
men
the
tales
natera
followers
related
won
gasps
of
astonishment
from
men
villa
villa
battles
ciudad
juarez
tierra
blanca
chihuahua
torreon
the
bare
facts
the
mere
citing
of
observation
and
experience
meant
nothing
but
the
real
story
with
its
extraordinary
contrasts
of
high
exploits
and
abysmal
cruelties
was
quite
different
villa
indomitable
lord
of
the
sierra
the
eternal
victim
of
all
governments
villa
tracked
hunted
down
like
a
wild
beast
villa
the
reincarnation
of
the
old
legend
villa
as
providence
the
bandit
that
passes
through
the
world
armed
with
the
blazing
torch
of
an
ideal
to
rob
the
rich
and
give
to
the
poor
it
was
the
poor
who
built
up
and
imposed
a
legend
about
him
which
time
itself
was
to
increase
and
embellish
as
a
shining
example
from
generation
to
generation
look
here
friend
one
of
natera
men
told
anastasio
if
general
villa
takes
a
fancy
to
you
he
give
you
a
ranch
on
the
spot
but
if
he
does
he
shoot
you
down
like
a
dog
god
you
ought
to
see
villa
troops
they
all
northerners
and
dressed
like
lords
you
ought
to
see
their
texas
hats
and
their
outfits
and
their
shoes
imported
from
the
s
a
as
they
retailed
the
wonders
of
villa
and
his
men
natera
men
gazed
at
one
another
ruefully
aware
that
their
own
hats
were
rotten
from
sunlight
and
moisture
that
their
own
shirts
and
trousers
were
tattered
and
barely
fit
to
cover
their
grimy
lousy
bodies
there
no
such
a
thing
as
hunger
up
there
they
carry
boxcars
full
of
oxen
sheep
cows
they
got
cars
full
of
clothing
trains
full
of
guns
ammunition
food
enough
to
make
a
man
burst
then
they
spoke
of
villa
airplanes
christ
those
planes
you
know
when
they
close
to
you
be
damned
if
you
know
what
the
hell
they
are
they
look
like
small
boats
you
know
or
tiny
rafts
and
then
pretty
soon
they
begin
to
rise
making
a
hell
of
a
row
something
like
an
automobile
going
sixty
miles
an
hour
then
they
like
great
big
birds
that
do
even
seem
to
move
sometimes
but
there
a
joker
the
things
have
got
some
american
fellow
inside
with
hand
grenades
by
the
thousand
now
you
try
and
figure
what
that
means
the
fight
is
on
see
you
know
how
a
farmer
feeds
corn
to
his
chickens
huh
well
the
american
throws
his
lead
bombs
at
the
enemy
just
like
that
pretty
soon
the
whole
damn
field
is
nothing
but
a
graveyard
dead
men
all
over
the
dump
dead
men
here
dead
men
there
dead
men
everywhere
anastasio
montanez
questioned
the
speaker
more
particularly
it
was
not
long
before
he
realized
that
all
this
high
praise
was
hearsay
and
that
not
a
single
man
in
natera
army
had
ever
laid
eyes
on
villa
well
when
you
get
down
to
it
i
guess
it
does
mean
so
much
no
man
got
much
more
guts
than
any
other
man
if
you
ask
me
all
you
need
to
be
a
good
fighter
is
pride
that
all
i
not
a
professional
soldier
even
though
i
dressed
like
hell
but
let
me
tell
you
i
not
forced
to
do
this
kind
of
bloody
job
because
i
own
because
i
own
over
twenty
oxen
whether
you
believe
it
or
not
quail
said
mocking
anastasio
xxi
the
firing
lessened
then
slowly
died
out
luis
cervantes
who
had
been
hiding
amid
a
heap
of
ruins
at
the
fortification
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
made
bold
to
show
his
face
how
he
had
managed
to
hang
on
he
did
not
know
nor
did
he
know
when
demetrio
and
his
men
had
disappeared
suddenly
he
had
found
himself
alone
then
hurled
back
by
an
avalanche
of
infantry
he
fell
from
his
saddle
a
host
of
men
trampled
over
him
until
he
rose
from
the
ground
and
a
man
on
horseback
hoisted
him
up
behind
him
after
a
few
moments
horse
and
riders
fell
left
without
rifle
revolver
or
arms
of
any
kind
cervantes
found
himself
lost
in
the
midst
of
white
smoke
and
whistling
bullets
a
hole
amid
a
debris
of
crumbling
stone
offered
a
refuge
of
safety
hello
partner
luis
how
are
you
the
horse
threw
me
they
fell
upon
me
then
they
took
my
gun
away
you
see
they
thought
i
was
dead
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
luis
cervantes
explained
apologetically
then
nobody
threw
me
down
solis
said
i
here
because
i
like
to
play
safe
the
irony
in
solis
voice
brought
a
blush
to
cervantes
cheek
by
god
that
chief
of
yours
is
a
man
solis
said
what
daring
what
assurance
he
left
me
gasping
and
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
other
men
with
more
experience
than
me
too
luis
cervantes
vouchsafed
no
answer
what
were
you
there
oh
i
see
you
found
a
nice
place
for
yourself
at
the
right
time
come
here
luis
i
explain
let
go
behind
that
rock
from
this
meadow
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
no
road
save
this
path
below
to
the
right
the
incline
is
too
sharp
you
ca
do
anything
there
and
it
worse
to
the
left
the
ascent
is
so
dangerous
that
a
second
hesitation
means
a
fall
down
those
rocks
and
a
broken
neck
at
the
end
of
it
all
right
a
number
of
men
from
brigade
who
went
down
to
the
meadow
decided
to
attack
the
trenches
the
first
chance
they
got
the
bullets
whizzed
about
us
the
battle
raged
on
all
sides
for
a
time
they
stopped
firing
so
we
thought
they
were
being
attacked
from
behind
we
stormed
their
trenches
look
partner
look
at
that
meadow
it
thick
with
corpses
their
machine
guns
did
that
for
us
they
mowed
us
down
like
wheat
only
a
handful
escaped
those
goddamned
officers
went
white
as
a
sheet
even
though
we
had
reinforcements
they
were
afraid
to
order
a
new
charge
that
was
when
demetrio
macias
plunged
in
did
he
wait
for
orders
not
he
he
just
shouted
on
boys
let
go
for
them
fool
i
thought
the
hell
does
he
think
he
doing
the
officers
surprised
said
nothing
demetrio
horse
seemed
to
wear
eagle
claws
instead
of
hoofs
it
soared
so
swiftly
over
the
rocks
on
come
on
his
men
shouted
following
him
like
wild
deer
horses
and
men
welded
into
a
mad
stampede
only
one
young
fellow
stepped
wild
and
fell
headlong
into
the
pit
in
a
few
seconds
the
others
appeared
at
the
top
of
the
hill
storming
the
trenches
and
killing
the
federals
by
the
thousand
with
his
rope
demetrio
lassoed
the
machine
guns
and
carried
them
off
like
a
bull
herd
throwing
a
steer
yet
his
success
could
not
last
much
longer
for
the
federals
were
far
stronger
in
numbers
and
could
easily
have
destroyed
demetrio
and
his
men
but
we
took
advantage
of
their
confusion
we
rushed
upon
them
and
they
soon
cleared
out
of
their
position
that
chief
of
yours
is
a
wonderful
soldier
standing
on
the
crest
of
the
hill
they
could
easily
sight
one
side
of
the
bufa
peak
its
highest
crag
spread
out
like
the
feathered
head
of
a
proud
aztec
king
the
slope
was
literally
covered
with
dead
their
hair
matted
their
clothes
clotted
with
grime
and
blood
a
host
of
ragged
women
vultures
of
prey
ranged
over
the
tepid
bodies
of
the
dead
stripping
one
man
bare
despoiling
another
robbing
from
a
third
his
dearest
possessions
amid
clouds
of
white
rifle
smoke
and
the
dense
black
vapors
of
flaming
buildings
houses
with
wide
doors
and
windows
bolted
shone
in
the
sunlight
the
streets
seemed
to
be
piled
upon
one
another
or
wound
picturesquely
about
fantastic
corners
or
set
to
scale
the
hills
nearby
above
the
graceful
cluster
of
houses
rose
the
lithe
columns
of
a
warehouse
and
the
towers
and
cupola
of
the
church
how
beautiful
the
revolution
even
in
its
most
barbarous
aspect
it
is
beautiful
solis
said
with
deep
feeling
then
a
vague
melancholy
seized
him
and
speaking
low
a
pity
what
remains
to
do
wo
be
as
beautiful
we
must
wait
a
while
until
there
are
no
men
left
to
fight
on
either
side
until
no
sound
of
shot
rings
through
the
air
save
from
the
mob
as
it
falls
upon
the
booty
we
must
wait
until
the
psychology
of
our
race
condensed
into
two
words
shines
clear
and
luminous
as
a
drop
of
water
robbery
murder
what
a
colossal
failure
we
would
make
of
it
friend
if
we
who
offer
our
enthusiasm
and
lives
to
crush
a
wretched
tyrant
became
the
builders
of
a
monstrous
edifice
holding
one
hundred
or
two
hundred
thousand
monsters
of
exactly
the
same
sort
people
without
ideals
a
tyrant
folk
vain
bloodshed
large
groups
of
federals
pushed
up
the
hill
fleeing
from
the
high
hats
a
bullet
whistled
past
them
singing
as
it
sped
after
his
speech
alberto
solis
stood
lost
in
thought
his
arms
crossed
suddenly
he
took
fright
i
be
damned
if
i
like
these
plaguey
mosquitoes
he
said
get
away
from
here
so
scornfully
luis
cervantes
smiled
that
solis
sat
down
on
a
rock
quite
calm
bewildered
he
smiled
his
gaze
roved
as
he
watched
the
spirals
of
smoke
from
the
rifles
the
dust
of
roofs
crumbling
from
houses
as
they
fell
before
the
artillery
he
believed
he
discerned
the
symbol
of
the
revolution
in
these
clouds
of
dust
and
smoke
that
climbed
upward
together
met
at
the
crest
of
the
hill
and
a
moment
after
were
lost
by
heaven
now
i
see
what
it
all
means
he
sketched
a
vast
gesture
pointing
to
the
station
locomotives
belched
huge
clouds
of
black
dense
smoke
rising
in
columns
the
trains
were
overloaded
with
fugitives
who
had
barely
managed
to
escape
from
the
captured
town
suddenly
he
felt
a
sharp
blow
in
the
stomach
as
though
his
legs
were
putty
he
rolled
off
the
rock
his
ears
buzzed
then
darkness
silence
eternity
part
two
i
demetrio
nonplussed
scratched
his
head
look
here
do
ask
me
any
more
questions
you
gave
me
the
eagle
i
wear
on
my
hat
did
you
all
right
then
you
just
tell
me
do
this
or
do
that
and
that
all
there
is
to
it
to
champagne
that
sparkles
and
foams
as
the
beaded
bubbles
burst
at
the
brim
of
the
glass
demetrio
preferred
the
native
tequila
limpid
and
fiery
the
soldiers
sat
in
groups
about
the
tables
in
the
restaurant
ragged
men
filthy
with
sweat
dirt
and
smoke
their
hair
matted
wild
disheveled
i
killed
two
colonels
one
man
clamored
in
a
guttural
harsh
voice
he
was
a
small
fat
fellow
with
embroidered
hat
and
chamois
coat
wearing
a
light
purple
handkerchief
about
his
neck
they
were
so
goddamned
fat
they
could
even
run
by
god
i
wish
you
could
have
seen
them
tripping
and
stumbling
at
every
step
they
took
climbing
up
the
hill
red
as
tomatoes
their
tongues
hanging
out
like
hounds
run
so
fast
you
lousy
beggars
i
called
after
them
not
so
fond
of
frightened
geese
stop
you
bastards
i
wo
harm
you
you
need
worry
by
god
they
certainly
fell
for
it
pop
pop
one
shot
for
each
of
them
and
a
rest
for
a
pair
of
poor
sinners
be
damned
to
them
i
could
get
a
single
one
of
their
generals
said
a
swarthy
man
who
sat
in
one
corner
between
the
wall
and
the
bar
holding
his
rifle
between
his
outstretched
legs
i
sighted
one
a
fellow
with
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
gold
plastered
all
over
him
his
gold
chevrons
shone
like
a
goddamned
sunset
and
i
let
him
go
by
fool
that
i
was
he
took
off
his
handkerchief
and
waved
it
i
stood
there
with
my
mouth
wide
open
like
a
fool
then
i
ducked
and
he
started
shooting
bullet
after
bullet
i
let
him
kill
a
poor
cargador
then
i
said
turn
now
holy
virgin
mother
of
god
do
let
me
miss
this
son
of
a
bitch
but
by
christ
he
disappeared
he
was
riding
a
hell
of
a
fine
nag
he
went
by
me
like
lightning
there
was
another
poor
fool
coming
up
the
road
he
got
it
and
turned
the
prettiest
somersault
you
ever
saw
talk
flew
from
lip
to
lip
each
soldier
vying
with
his
fellow
snatching
the
words
from
the
other
mouth
as
they
declaimed
passionately
women
with
olive
swarthy
skins
bright
eyes
and
teeth
of
ivory
with
revolvers
at
their
waists
across
their
breasts
and
broad
mexican
hats
on
their
heads
wove
their
way
like
stray
street
curs
in
and
out
among
groups
a
vulgar
wench
with
rouged
cheeks
and
dark
brown
arms
and
neck
gave
a
great
leap
and
landed
on
the
bar
near
demetrio
table
he
turned
his
head
toward
her
and
literally
collided
with
a
pair
of
lubric
eyes
under
a
narrow
forehead
and
thick
straight
hair
parted
in
the
middle
the
door
opened
wide
anastasio
pancracio
quail
and
meco
filed
in
dazed
anastasio
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
and
stepped
forward
to
shake
hands
with
the
little
fat
man
wearing
a
charro
suit
and
a
lavender
bandanna
a
pair
of
old
friends
met
again
so
warm
was
their
embrace
so
tightly
they
clutched
each
other
that
the
blood
rushed
to
their
heads
they
turned
purple
look
here
demetrio
i
want
the
honor
of
introducing
you

he

man

that
damn
jail
at
escobedo
where
we
stayed
together
for
over
a
year
without
removing
his
cigar
from
his
lips
demetrio
buried
in
a
sullen
silence
amid
the
bustle
and
uproar
offered
his
hand
and
said
i
delighted
to
meet
you
so
your
name
is
demetrio
macias
the
girl
asked
suddenly
seated
on
the
bar
she
swung
her
legs
at
every
swing
the
toes
of
her
shoes
touched
demetrio
back
yes
i
demetrio
macias
he
said
scarcely
turning
toward
her
indifferently
she
continued
to
swing
her
legs
displaying
her
blue
stockings
with
ostentation
hey

here

down
and

a
drink
said
the
man
called
blondie
the
girl
accepted
readily
and
boldly
thrust
her
way
through
the
crowd
to
a
chair
facing
demetrio
so

famous
demetrio
macias
the
hero
of
zacatecas

while
blondie
laughing
said

wise
one

paint

want
to
sport
a
general
without
understanding
blondie
words
demetrio
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
they
gazed
at
each
other
like
two
dogs
sniffing
one
another
with
distrust
demetrio
could
not
resist
her
furiously
provocative
glances
he
was
forced
to
lower
his
eyes
from
their
seats
some
of
natera
officers
began
to
hurl
obscenities
at
war
paint
without
paying
the
slightest
attention
she
said

natera

to
hand

little
general

here
and

she
stuck
out
her
hand
at
demetrio
and
shook
it
with
the
strength
of
a
man
demetrio
melting
to
the
congratulations
raining
down
upon
him

the
restaurant
was
crowded
small
stars
bars
eagles
and
insignia
of
every
sort
or
description
dotted
their
hats
they
wore
wide
silk
bandannas
around
their
necks
large
diamond
rings
on
their
fingers
large
heavy
gold

if
i
had
pulled
my
beard
hair
by
hair
have
died
a
long
time
ago
from
sheer
anger
it
does
you
no
good
to
go
to
pieces
when
you
angry
a
man
affirmed
earnestly
from
below
a
hat
that
covered
his
head
as
a
roof
does
a
house
when
i
was
up
at
torreon
i
killed
an
old
lady
who
refused
to
sell
me
some
enchiladas
she
was
angry
i
can
tell
you
i
got
no
enchiladas
but
i
felt
satisfied
anyhow
i
killed
a
storekeeper
at
parral
because
he
gave
me
some
change
and
there
were
two
huerta
bills
in
it
said
a
man
with
a
star
on
his
hat
and
precious
stones
on
his
black
calloused
hands
down
in
chihuahua
i
killed
a
man
because
i
always
saw
him
sitting
at
the
table
whenever
i
went
to
eat
i
hated
the
looks
of
him
so
i
just
killed
him
what
the
hell
could
i
do
hmm
i
killed
the
theme
is
inexhaustible
by
dawn
when
the
restaurant
was
wild
with
joy
and
the
floor
dotted
with
spittle
young
painted
girls
from
the
suburbs
had
mingled
freely
among
the
dark
northern
women
demetrio
pulled
out
his
jeweled
gold
watch
asking
anastasio
montanez
to
tell
him
the
time
anastasio
glanced
at
the
watch
then
poking
his
head
out
of
a
small
window
gazed
at
the
starry
sky
the
pleiades
are
pretty
low
in
the
west
i
guess
it
wo
be
long
now
before
daybreak
outside
the
restaurant
the
shouts
laughter
and
song
of
the
drunkards
rang
through
the
air
men
galloped
wildly
down
the
streets
the
hoofs
of
their
horses
hammering
on
the
sidewalks
from
every
quarter
of
the
town
pistols
spoke
guns
belched
demetrio
and
the
girl
called
war
paint
staggered
tipsily
hand
in
hand
down
the
center
of
the
street
bound
for
the
hotel
ii
what
damned
fools
said
war
paint
convulsed
with
laughter
where
the
hell
do
you
come
from
soldiers
do
sleep
in
hotels
and
inns
any
more
where
do
you
come
from
you
just
go
anywhere
you
like
and
pick
a
house
that
pleases
you
see
when
you
go
there
make
yourself
at
home
and
do
ask
anyone
for
anything
what
the
hell
is
the
use
of
the
revolution
who
it
for
for
the
folks
who
live
in
towns
we
the
city
folk
now
see
come
on
pancracio
hand
me
your
bayonet
damn
these
rich
people
they
lock
up
everything
they
got
she
dug
the
steel
point
through
the
crack
of
a
drawer
and
pressing
on
the
hilt
broke
the
lock
opened
the
splinted
cover
of
a
writing
desk
anastasio
pancracio
and
war
paint
plunged
their
hands
into
a
mass
of
post
cards
photographs
pictures
and
papers
scattering
them
all
over
the
rug
finding
nothing
he
wanted
pancracio
gave
vent
to
his
anger
by
kicking
a
framed
photograph
into
the
air
with
the
toe
of
his
shoe
it
smashed
on
the
candelabra
in
the
center
of
the
room
they
pulled
their
empty
hands
out
of
the
heap
of
paper
cursing
but
war
paint
was
of
sterner
stuff
tirelessly
she
continued
to
unlock
drawer
after
drawer
without
failing
to
investigate
a
single
spot
in
their
absorption
they
did
not
notice
a
small
gray
box
which
rolled
silently
across
the
floor
coming
to
a
stop
at
luis
cervantes
feet
demetrio
lying
on
the
rug
seemed
to
be
asleep
cervantes
who
had
watched
everything
with
profound
indifference
pulled
the
box
closer
to
him
with
his
foot
and
stooping
to
scratch
his
ankle
swiftly
picked
it
up
something
gleamed
up
at
him
dazzling
it
was
two
diamonds
mounted
in
filigreed
platinum
hastily
he
thrust
them
inside
his
coat
pocket
when
demetrio
awoke
cervantes
said
general
look
at
the
mess
these
boys
have
made
here
do
you
think
it
would
be
advisable
to
forbid
this
sort
of
thing
no
it
about
their
only
pleasure
after
putting
their
bellies
up
as
targets
for
the
enemy
bullets
yes
of
course
general
but
they
could
do
it
somewhere
else
you
see
this
sort
of
thing
hurts
our
prestige
and
worse
our
cause
demetrio
leveled
his
eagle
eyes
at
cervantes
he
drummed
with
his
fingernails
against
his
teeth
then
come
along
now
do
blush
he
said
you
can
talk
like
that
to
someone
else
we
know
what
mine
is
mine
what
yours
is
yours
you
picked
the
box
all
right
i
picked
my
gold
watch
all
right
too
his
words
dispelled
any
pretense
both
of
them
in
perfect
harmony
displayed
their
booty
war
paint
and
her
companions
were
ransacking
the
rest
of
the
house
quail
entered
the
room
with
a
girl
upon
whose
forehead
and
arms
were
already
marked
spots
they
stopped
short
speechless
with
surprise
as
they
saw
the
books
lying
in
piles
on
the
floor
chairs
and
tables
the
large
mirrors
thrown
to
the
ground
smashed
the
huge
albums
and
the
photographs
torn
into
shreds
the
furniture
objets
and
broken
quail
held
his
breath
his
avid
eyes
scouring
the
room
for
booty
outside
in
one
corner
of
the
patio
lost
in
dense
clouds
of
suffocating
smoke
manteca
was
boiling
corn
on
the
cob
feeding
his
fire
with
books
and
paper
that
made
the
flames
leap
wildly
through
the
air
hey
quail
shouted
look
what
i
found
a
fine
for
my
mare
with
a
swift
pull
he
wrenched
down
a
hanging
which
fell
over
a
handsomely
carved
upright
chair
look
look
at
all
these
naked
women
quail
little
companion
cried
enchanted
at
a
de

along
she
began
to
tear
out
the
illustrations
which
pleased
her
most
demetrio
crossed
the
room
and
sat
down
beside
luis
cervantes
he
ordered
some
beer
handed
one
bottle
up
to
his
secretary
downed
his
own
bottle
at
one
gulp
then
drowsily
he
half
closed
his
eyes
and
soon
fell
sound
asleep
hey

man

to
pancracio
from
the
threshold
when

the
rest

now
i
make
you
major
how
that
blondie
was
a
round
little
fellow
with
waxed
mustache
when
he
laughed
his
blue
eyes
disappeared
mischievously
between
his
forehead
and
his
fat
cheeks
he
had
been
a
waiter
at
el
monico
in
chihuahua
now
he
proudly
wore
three
small
brass
bars
the
insignia
of
his
rank
in
the
northern
division
blondie
showered
eulogy
after
eulogy
on
demetrio
and
his
men
this
proved
sufficient
reason
for
bringing
out
a
fresh
case
of
beer
which
was
finished
in
short
order
suddenly
war
paint
reappeared
in
the
middle
of
the
room
wearing
a
beautiful
silk
dress
covered
with
exquisite
lace
you
forgot
the
stockings
blondie
shouted
shaking
with
laughter
quail
girl
also
burst
out
laughing
but
war
paint
did
not
care
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
indifferently
sat
down
on
the
floor
kicked
off
her
white
satin
slippers
and
wiggled
her
toes
happily
giving
their
muscles
a
freedom
welcome
after
their
tight
confinement
in
the
slippers
she
said
hey
you
pancracio
go
and
get
me
my
blue
stockings
they
with
the
rest
of
my
plunder
soldiers
and
their
friends
companions
and
veterans
of
other
campaigns
began
to
enter
in
groups
of
twos
and
threes
demetrio
growing
excited
began
to
narrate
in
detail
his
most
notable
feats
of
arms
what
the
hell
is
that
noise
he
asked
in
surprise
as
he
heard
string
and
brass
instruments
tuning
up
in
the
patio
general
demetrio
macias
luis
cervantes
said
solemnly
it
a
banquet
all
of
your
old
friends
and
followers
are
giving
in
your
honor
to
celebrate
your
victory
at
zacatecas
and
your
promotion
to
the
rank
of
general
iii
general
macias
i
want
you
to
meet
my
future
wife
luis
cervantes
said
with
great
emphasis
as
he
led
a
beautiful
girl
into
the
dining
room
they
all
turned
to
look
at
her
her
large
blue
eyes
grew
wide
in
wonder
she
was
barely
fourteen
her
skin
was
like
a
rose
soft
pink
fresh
her
hair
was
very
fair
the
expression
in
her
eyes
was
partly
impish
curiosity
partly
a
vague
childish
fear
perceiving
that
demetrio
eyed
her
like
a
beast
of
prey
luis
cervantes
congratulated
himself
they
made
room
for
her
between
luis
cervantes
and
blondie
opposite
demetrio
bottles
of
tequila
dishes
of
cut
glass
bowls
porcelains
and
vases
lay
scattered
over
the
table
indiscriminately
meco
carrying
a
box
of
beer
upon
his
shoulders
came
in
cursing
and
sweating
you
do
know
this
fellow
blondie
yet
said
war
paint
noticing
the
persistent
glances
he
was
casting
at
luis
cervantes
bride
he
a
smart
fellow
i
can
tell
you
and
he
never
misses
a
trick
she
gazed
at
him
lecherously
adding
that
why
i
do
like
to
see
him
close
even
on
a
photograph
the
orchestra
struck
up
a
raucous
march
as
though
they
were
playing
at
a
bullfight
the
soldiers
roared
with
joy
what
fine
tripe
general
i
swear
i
have
tasted
the
like
of
it
in
all
my
life
blondie
said
as
he
began
to
reminisce
about
el
monico
at
chihuahua
you
really
like
it
blondie
responded
demetrio
go
ahead

for
more

bellyful

just
the
way
i
like
it
anastasio
chimed
in
yes
i
like
good
food
but
nothing
really
tastes
good
to
you
unless
you
belch
the
noise
of
mouths
being
filled
of
ravenous
feeding
followed
all
drank
copiously
at
the
end
of
the
dinner
luis
cervantes
rose
holding
a
champagne
glass
in
one
hand
and
said
general
ho
war
paint
interrupted
this
business
is
for
me
i
all
against
it
i
go
out
to
the
corral
since
there
no
more
eating
here
presenting
demetrio
with
a
black
box
containing
a
small
brass
eagle
luis
cervantes
made
a
toast
which
no
one
understood
but
everyone
applauded
enthusiastically
demetrio
took
the
insignia
in
his
hands
and
with
flushed
face
and
eyes
shining
declared
with
great
candor
what
in
hell
am
i
going
to
do
with
this
buzzard
compadre
anastasio
montanez
said
in
a
tremulous
voice
i
ai
got
much
to
tell
you
whole
minutes
elapsed
between
his
words
the
cursed
words
would
not
come
to
anastasio
his
face
coated
with
filth
unwashed
for
days
turned
crimson
shining
with
perspiration
finally
he
decided
to
finish
his
toast
at
all
costs
well
i
ai
got
much
to
tell
you
except
that
we
are
pals
then
since
everyone
had
applauded
at
the
end
of
luis
speech
anastasio
having
finished
made
a
sign
and
the
company
clapped
their
hands
in
great
gravity
but
everything
turned
out
for
the
best
since
his
awkwardness
inspired
others
manteca
and
quail
stood
up
and
made
their
toasts
too
when
meco
turn
came
war
paint
rushed
in
shouting
jubilantly
attempting
to
drag
a
splendid
black
horse
into
the
dining
room
my
booty
my
booty
she
cried
patting
the
superb
animal
on
the
neck
it
resisted
every
effort
she
made
until
a
strong
jerk
of
the
rope
and
a
sudden
lash
brought
it
in
prancing
smartly
the
soldiers
half
drunk
stared
at
the
beast
with
envy
i
do
know
what
the
hell
this
got
but
she
always
beats
everybody
to
it
cried
blondie
she
been
the
same
ever
since
she
joined
us
at
tierra
blanca
hey
pancracio

me
some
alfalfa
for
my
horse
war
paint
commanded
crisply
throwing
the
horse
rope
to
one
of
the
soldiers
once
more
they
filled
their
glasses
many
a
head
hung
low
with
fatigue
or
drunkenness
most
of
the
company
however
shouted
with
glee
including
luis
cervantes
girl
she
had
spilled
all
her
wine
on
a
handkerchief
and
looked
all
about
her
with
blue
wondering
eyes
boys
blondie
suddenly
screamed
his
shrill
guttural
voice
dominating
the
mall
i
tired
of
living
i
feel
like
killing
myself
right
now
i
sick
and
tired
of
war
paint
and
this
other
little
angel
from
heaven
wo
even
look
at
me
luis
cervantes
saw
that
the
last
remark
was
addressed
to
his
bride
with
great
surprise
he
realized
that
it
was
not
demetrio
foot
he
had
noticed
close
to
the
girl
but
blondie
he
was
boiling
with
indignation
keep
your
eye
on
me
boys
blondie
went
on
gun
in
hand
i
going
to
shoot
myself
right
in
the
forehead
he
aimed
at
the
large
mirror
on
the
opposite
wall
which
gave
back
his
whole
body
in
reflection
he
took
careful
aim
do
move
war
paint
the
bullet
whizzed
by
grazing
war
paint
hair
the
mirror
broke
into
large
jagged
fragments
she
did
not
even
so
much
as
blink
iv
late
in
the
afternoon
luis
cervantes
rubbed
his
eyes
and
sat
up
he
had
been
sleeping
on
the
hard
pavement
close
to
the
trunk
of
a
fruit
tree
anastasio
pancracio
and
quail
slept
nearby
breathing
heavily
his
lips
were
swollen
his
nose
dry
and
cold
there
were
bloodstains
on
his
hands
and
shirt
at
once
he
recalled
what
had
taken
place
soon
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
made
for
one
of
the
bedrooms
he
pushed
at
the
door
several
times
without
being
able
to
force
it
open
for
a
few
minutes
he
stood
there
hesitating
no
he
had
not
dreamed
it
everything
had
really
occurred
just
as
he
recalled
it
he
had
left
the
table
with
his
bride
and
taken
her
to
the
bedroom
but
just
as
he
was
closing
the
door
demetrio
staggered
after
them
and
made
one
leap
toward
them
then
war
paint
dashed
in
after
demetrio
and
began
to
struggle
with
him
demetrio
his
eyes
his
lips
covered
with
long
blond
hairs
looked
for
the
bride
in
despair
but
war
paint
pushed
him
back
vigorously
what
the
hell
is
the
matter
with
you
what
the
hell
are
you
trying
to
do
he
demanded
furious
war
paint
put
her
leg
between
his
twisted
it
suddenly
and
demetrio
fell
to
the
ground
outside
of
the
bedroom
he
rose
raging
help
help
he
going
to
kill
me
she
cried
seizing
wrist
and
turning
the
gun
aside
the
bullet
hit
the
floor
war
paint
continued
to
shriek
anastasio
disarmed
demetrio
from
behind
demetrio
standing
like
a
furious
bull
in
the
middle
of
the
arena
cast
fierce
glances
at
all
the
bystanders
luis
cervantes
anastasio
manteca
and
the
others
goddamn

taken
my
gun
away
christ
as
if
i
needed
any
gun
to
beat
the
hell
out
of
you
flinging
out
his
arms
beating
and
pummeling
he
felled
everyone
within
reach
down
they
rolled
like
tenpins
then
after
that
luis
cervantes
could
remember
nothing
more
perhaps
his
bride
terrified
by
all
these
brutes
had
wisely
vanished
and
hidden
herself
perhaps
this
bedroom
communicates
with
the
living
room
and
i
can
go
in
through
there
he
thought
standing
at
the
threshold
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps

paint
woke
up
she
lay
on
the
rug
close
to
demetrio
at
the
foot
of
a
couch
filled
with
alfalfa
and
corn
where

black
horse
had
fed

but
she

not
find

she
was
much
surprised
quickly
she
ran
to
the
bedroom
door
and
peered
through
the
keyhole
standing
motionless
until
her
eye
grew
accustomed
to
the
darkness
within
without
drawing
away
she
said
you
damned
blondie

of
a
bitch

minute

clearer
the
sun
margined
the
diaphanous
sky
with
a
fringe
of
crimson
like
the
bony
shoulders
of
immense
sleeping
monsters
the
chains
of
mountains
rose
in
the
distance
crags
there
were
like
heads
of
colossal
native
idols
others
like
giants
faces
their
grimaces
or
grotesque
calling
forth
a
smile
or
a
shudder
at
a
presentment
of
mystery
demetrio
macias
rode
at
the
head
of
his
men
behind
him
the
members
of
his
staff
colonel
anastasio
montanez
pancracio
majors
luis
cervantes
and
blondie
still
further
behind
came
war
paint
with
venancio
who
paid
her
many
compliments
and
recited
the
despairing
verses
of
antonio
plaza
as
the
sun
rays
began
to
slip
from
the
housetops
they
made
their
entrance
into
moyahua
four
abreast
to
the
sound
of
the
bugle
the
roosters
chorus
was
deafening
dogs
barked
their
alarm
but
not
a
living
soul
stirred
on
the
streets
war
paint
spurred
her
black
horse
and
with
one
jump
was
abreast
with
demetrio
they
rode
forward
elbow
to
elbow
she
wore
a
silk
dress
and
heavy
gold
earrings
proudly
her
pale
blue
gown
deepened
her
olive
skin
and
the
coppery
spots
on
her
face
and
arms
riding
astride
she
had
pulled
her
skirts
up
to
her
knees
her
stockings
showed
filthy
and
full
of
runs
she
wore
a
gun
at
her
side
a
cartridge
belt
hung
over
the
pommel
of
her
saddle
demetrio
was
also
dressed
in
his
best
clothes
his
hat
was
richly
embroidered
his
leather
trousers
were
and
adorned
with
silver
buttons
his
coat
was
embroidered
with
gold
thread
there
was
a
sound
of
doors
being
beaten
down
and
forced
open
the
soldiers
had
already
scattered
through
the
town
to
gather
together
ammunition
and
saddles
from
everywhere
we
going
to
bid
monico
good
morning
demetrio
said
gravely
dismounting
and
tossing
his
bridle
to
one
of
his
men
we
going
to
have
breakfast
with
don
monico
who
a
particular
friend
of
mine
the
general
staff
smiled
a
sinister
malign
smile
making
their
spurs
ring
against
the
pavement
they
walked
toward
a
large
pretentious
house
obviously
that
of
a
cacique
it
closed
airtight
anastasio
montanez
said
pushing
the
door
with
all
his
might

answered
lowering
his
rifle
and
pointing
it
at
the
lock
no

demetrio
said

three
blows
with
the
butt
of
the
rifle
three
more
no

pancracio
disobeys
orders
he
fires
smashing
the
lock
the
door
opens
behind
a
confusion
of
skirts
and
children
bare
legs
rushing
to
and
fro
i
want
wine
hey
there

demetrio
cries
in
an
imperious
voice
pounding
heavily
on
a
table
sit
down
boys
a
lady
peeps
out
another
a
third
from
among
black
skirts
the
heads
of
frightened
children
one
of
the
women
trembling
walks
toward
a
cupboard
and
taking
out
some
glasses
and
a
bottle
serves
wine
what
arms
have
you
demetrio
demands
harshly
arms
arms
the
lady
answers
a
taste
of
ashes
on
her
tongue
what
arms

to
have

respectable
lonely
old
ladies

what

pancracio
interrupts
brutally
did
they
spring
from
the
earth
the
women
disappear
hurriedly
to
return
with
an
old
shotgun
covered
with
dust
and
cobwebs
and
a
pistol
with
rusty
broken
springs
demetrio
smiles
all
right
then
let
see
the
money
money
money
but
what
money
do
you
think
a
couple
of
spinsters
have
spinsters
alone
in
the
world
they
glance
up
in
supplication
at
the
nearest
soldier
but
they
are
seized
with
horror
for
they
have
just
seen
the
roman
soldier
who
crucified
our
lord
in
the
via
crucis
of
the
parish
they
have
seen
pancracio
demetrio
repeats
his
order
to
search
once
again
the
women
disappear
to
return
this
time
with
a
wallet
containing
a
few
huerta
bills
demetrio
smiles
and
without
further
delay
calls
to
his
men
to
come
in
like
hungry
dogs
who
have
sniffed
their
meat
the
mob
bursts
in
trampling
down
the
women
who
sought
to
bar
the
entrance
with
their
bodies
several
faint
fall
to
the
ground
others
flee
in
panic
the
children
scream
pancracio
is
about
to
break
the
lock
of
a
huge
wardrobe
when
suddenly
the
doors
open
and
out
comes
a
man
with
a
rifle
in
his
hands
senor
don
monico
they
all
exclaim
in
surprise
demetrio
please
do
harm
me
please
do
harm
me
please

you
know
senor
don
demetrio
i
your
friend
demetrio
macias

slyly
are
friends
he
asked
usually
welcomed
gun
in
hand
don
monico
in
consternation
throws
himself
at
demetrio
feet
clasps
his
knees
kisses
his
shoes
my
wife
my
children
please
senor
don
demetrio
my
friend
demetrio
with
taut
hand
puts
his
gun
back
in
the
holster
a
painful
silhouette
crosses
his
mind
he
sees
a
woman
with
a
child
in
her
arms
walking
over
the
rocks
of
the
sierra
in
the
moonlight
a
house
in
flames
clear
out
everybody
outside
he
orders
darkly
his
staff
obeys
monico
and
the
ladies
kiss
his
hands
weeping
with
gratitude
the
mob
in
the
street
talking
and
laughing
stands
waiting
for
the
general
permission
to
ransack
the
cacique
house
i
know
where
they
buried
their
money
but
i
wo
tell
says
a
youngster
with
a
basket
in
his
hands
hm
i
know
the
right
place
mind
you
says
an
old
woman
carrying
a
burlap
sack
to
hold
whatever
the
good
lord
will
provide
it
on
top
of
something
there
a
lot
of
trinkets
nearby
and
then
there
a
small
bag
with
around
it
that
the
thing
to
look
for
you
ai
talking
sense
woman
puts
in
a
man
they
ai
such
fools
as
to
leave
silver
lying
loose
like
that
i
thinking
they
got
it
buried
in
the
well
in
a
leather
bag
the
mob
moves
slowly
some
carry
ropes
to
tie
about
their
bundles
others
wooden
trays
the
women
open
out
their
aprons
or
shawls
calculating
their
capacity
all
give
thanks
to
divine
providence
as
they
wait
for
their
share
of
the
booty
when
demetrio
announces
that
he
will
not
allow
looting
and
orders
them
to
disband
the
mob
disconsolate
obeys
him
and
soon
scatters
but
there
is
a
dull
rumor
among
the
soldiers
and
no
one
moves
from
his
place
annoyed
demetrio
repeats
this
order
a
young
man
a
recent
recruit
his
head
turned
by
drink
laughs
and
walks
boldly
toward
the
door
but
before
he
has
reached
the
threshold
a
shot
lays
him
low
he
falls
like
a
bull
pierced
in
the
neck
by
the
matador
sword
motionless
his
smoking
gun
in
his
hand
demetrio
waits
for
the
soldiers
to
withdraw
set
fire
to
the
house
he
orders
luis
cervantes
when
they
reach
their
quarters
with
a
curious
eagerness
luis
cervantes
does
not
transmit
the
order
but
undertakes
the
task
in
person
two
hours
later
when
the
city
square
was
black
with
smoke
and
enormous
tongues
of
fire
rose
from
monico
house
no
one
could
account
for
the
strange
behavior
of
the
general
vi
they
established
themselves
in
a
large
gloomy
house
which
likewise
belonged
to
the
cacique
of
moyahua
the
previous
occupants
had
already
left
strong
evidences
in
the
patio
which
had
been
converted
into
a
manure
pile
the
walls
once
whitewashed
were
now
faded
and
cracked
revealing
the
bare
unbaked
adobe
the
floor
had
been
torn
up
by
the
hoofs
of
animals
the
orchard
was
littered
with
rotted
branches
and
dead
leaves
from
the
entrance
one
stumbled
over
broken
bits
of
chairs
and
other
furniture
covered
with
dirt
by
ten
luis
cervantes
yawned
with
boredom
said
good
night
to
blondie
and
war
paint
who
were
downing
endless
drinks
on
a
bench
in
the
square
and
made
for
the
barracks
the
drawing
room
was
alone
furnished
as
he
entered
demetrio
lying
on
the
floor
with
his
eyes
wide
open
trying
to
count
the
beams
gazed
at
him
it
you
eh
what
new
come
on
sit
down
luis
cervantes
first
went
over
to
trim
the
candle
then
drew
up
a
chair
without
a
back
a
coarse
rag
doing
the
duty
of
a
wicker
bottom
the
legs
of
the
chair
squeaked
war
paint
black
horse
snorted
and
whirled
its
crupper
in
wide
circles
luis
cervantes
sank
into
his
seat
general

my
report

demetrio
said
looking
at
the
bulging
sack
of
silver
cervantes
was
passing
to
him
cervantes
left
his
seat
to
squat
down
by
demetrio
side
he
stretched
a
blanket
over
the
floor
and
into
it
poured
the
pieces
shining
burning
gold
first
of
all
general
only
you
and
i
know
about
this
secondly
you
know
well
enough
that
if
the
sun
shines
you
should
open
the
window
it
shining
in
our
faces
now
but
what
about
tomorrow
you
should
always
look
ahead
a
bullet
a
bolting
horse
even
a
wretched
cold
in
the
head
and
then
there
are
a
widow
and
orphans
left
in
absolute
want
the
government
ha

just
go
see
carranza
or
villa
or
any
of
the
big
chiefs
and

family
if
they
answer
with
a
kick
you
know
where
they
say
they
giving
you
a
handful
of
jewels
and
they
right
we
did
not
rise
up
in
arms
to
make
some
carranza
or
villa
president
of
our
republic
no
we
fought
to
defend
the
sacred
rights
of
the
people
against
the
tyranny
of
some
vile
cacique
and
so
just
as
villa
or
carranza
are
going
to
ask
our
consent
to
the
payment
they
getting
for
the
services
they
rendering
the
country
we
for
our
part
have
to
ask
anybody
permission
about
anything
either
demetrio
half
stood
up
grasped
a
bottle
that
stood
nearby
drained
it
then
spat
out
the
liquor
swelling
out
his
cheeks
by
god
my
boy
you
certainly
got
the
gift
of
gab
luis
felt
dizzy
faint
the
spattered
beer
seemed
to
intensify
the
stench
of
the
refuse
on
which
they
sat
a
carpet
of
orange
and
banana
peels
fleshlike
slices
of
watermelon
moldy
masses
of
mangoes
and
sugarcane
all
mixed
up
with
cornhusks
from
tamales
and
human
offal
demetrio
calloused
hands
shuffled
through
the
brilliant
coins
counting
and
counting
recovering
from
his
nausea
luis
cervantes
pulled
out
a
small
box
of
fallieres
phosphate
and
poured
forth
rings
brooches
pendants
and
countless
valuable
jewels
look
here
general
if
this
mess
does
blow
over
and
it
look
as
though
it
would
if
the
revolution
keeps
on
there
enough
here
already
for
us
to
live
on
abroad
quite
comfortably
demetrio
shook
his
bead
you
would
do
that
why
not
what
are
we
staying
on
for
what
cause
are
we
defending
now
that
something
i
ca
explain
tenderfoot
but
i
thinking
it
would
show
much
guts
take
your
choice
general
said
luis
cervantes
pointing
to
the
jewels
which
he
had
set
in
a
row
oh

i
fed
up
with
her
but
i
like
that

her
to
go
plumb
to
hell
that
the
way
i
am
see
when
i
like
a
woman
i
get
plain
silly
and
if
she
does
start
something
i
not
got
the
courage
to
do
anything
myself
he
sighed
there
camilla
at
the
ranch
for
instance
now
she
not
much
on
looks
i
know
but

a
woman
i
like

demetrio
winked
maliciously
i
promise
you

do
it
are
you
sure
do
you
really
mean
it
look
here
if
you
pull
that
off
for
me
i
give
you
the
watch
and
chain
you
hankering
after
luis
cervantes
eyes
shone
he
took
the
phosphate
box
heavy
with
its
contents
and
stood
up
smiling
i
see
you
tomorrow
he
said
good
night
general
sleep
well
vii
i
do
know
any
more
about
it
than
you
do
the
general
told
me
saddle
your
horse
and
my
black
mare
and
follow
cervantes
going
on
an
errand
for
me
well
that
what
happened
we
left
here
at
noon
and
reached
the
ranch
early
that
evening
maria
antonia
took
us
in
she
asked
after
you
pancracio
next
morning
luis
cervantes
wakes
me
up
quail
saddle
the
horses
leave
me
mine
but
take
the
general
mare
back
to
moyahua
i
catch
up
after
a
bit
the
sun
was
high
when
he
arrived
with
camilla
she
got
off
and
we
stuck
her
on
the
general
mare
well
and
her
what
sort
of
a
face
did
she
make
coming
back
one
of
the
men
inquired
hum
she
was
so
damned
happy
she
was
gabbing
all
the
way
and
the
tenderfoot
just
as
quiet
as
he
always
is
you
know
him
i
think
venancio
expressed
his
opinion
with
great
seriousness
that
if
camilla
woke
up
in
the
general
bed
it
was
just
a
mistake
we
drank
a
lot
remember
that
alcohol
went
to
our
heads
we
must
have
lost
our
senses
what
the
hell
do
you
mean
alcohol
it
was
all
cooked
up
between
cervantes
and
the
general
certainly
that
city
dude
nothing
but
a
i
do
like
to
talk
about
friends
behind
their
backs
said
blondie
but
i
can
tell
you
this
one
of
the
two
sweethearts
he
had
one
was
mine
and
the
other
was
for
the
general
they
burst
into
guffaws
of
laughter
when
war
paint
realized
what
had
happened
she
sought
out
camilla
and
spoke
with
great
affection
poor
little
child
tell
me
how
all
this
happened
camilla
eyes
were
red
from
weeping
he
lied
to
me
he
lied
he
came
to
the
ranch
and
he
told
me
i
came
just
to
get
you
do
you
want
to
go
away
with
me

to
loathe
to
grind
corn
mamma
would
call
me
to
eat
and
anything
i
put
in
my
mouth

no
taste
at
all
once
more
she
burst
into
tears
stuffing
the
corner
of
her
apron
into
her
mouth
to
drown
her
sobs
look
here
i
help
you

this
mess

think
about
the
dude
any
more
honest
to
god

not
worth
it
you
surely
know
his
game
dear
that
the
only
reason
why
the
general
stands
for
him
what
a
goose
all
right
you
want
to
go
back
home
the
holy
virgin
protect

my
mother

beat
me
to
death
she
do
nothing
of
the
sort
you
and
i
can
fix
things
listen
the
soldiers
are
leaving
any
moment
now
when
demetrio
tells
you
to
get
ready
you
tell
him
you
feel
pains
all
over
your
body
as
though
someone
had
hit
you
then
you
lie
down
and
start
yawning
and
shivering
then
put
your
hand
on
your
forehead
and
say
burning
up
with
fever
i
tell
demetrio
to
leave
us
both
here
that
i
stay
to
take
care
of
you
that
as
soon
as
you
feeling
all
right
again
we
catch
up
with
them
but
instead
of
that
i
see
that
you
get
home
safe
and
sound
viii
the
sun
had
set
the
town
was
lost
in
the
drab
melancholy
of
its
ancient
streets
amid
the
frightened
silence
of
its
inhabitants
who
had
retired
very
early
when
luis
cervantes
reached
primitivo
general
store
his
arrival
interrupting
a
party
that
promised
great
doings
demetrio
was
engaged
in
getting
drunk
with
his
old
comrades
the
entire
space
before
the
bar
was
occupied
war
paint
and
blondie
had
tied
up
their
horses
outside
but
the
other
officers
had
stormed
in
brutally
horses
and
all
embroidered
hats
with
enormous
and
concave
brims
bobbed
up
and
down
everywhere
the
horses
wheeled
about
prancing
tossing
their
restive
heads
their
fine
breed
showing
in
their
black
eyes
their
small
ears
and
dilating
nostrils
over
the
infernal
din
of
the
drunkards
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
horses
the
stamp
of
their
hoofs
on
the
tiled
floor
and
occasionally
a
quick
nervous
whinny
rang
out
a
trivial
episode
was
being
commented
upon
when
luis
cervantes
came
in
a
man
dressed
in
civilian
clothes
with
a
round
black
bloody
hole
in
his
forehead
lay
stretched
out
in
the
middle
of
the
street
his
mouth
gaping
opinion
was
at
first
divided
but
finally
all
concurred
with
blondie
sound
reasoning
the
poor
dead
devil
lying
out
there
was
the
church
sexton
but
what
an
idiot
his
own
fault
of
course
who
in
the
name
of
hell
could
be
so
foolish
as
to
dress
like
a
city
dude
with
trousers
coat
cap
and
all
pancracio
simply
could
not
bear
the
sight
of
a
city
man
in
front
of
him
and
that
was
that
eight
musicians
playing
wind
instruments
interrupted
their
labors
at
cervantes
command
their
faces
were
round
and
red
as
suns
their
eyes
popping
for
they
had
been
blowing
on
their
brass
instruments
since
dawn
general
luis
said
pushing
his
way
through
the
men
on
horseback
a
messenger
has
arrived
with
orders
to
proceed
immediately
to
the
pursuit
and
capture
of
orozco
and
his
men
faces
that
had
been
dark
and
gloomy
were
now
illumined
with
joy
to
jalisco
boys
cried
blondie
pounding
on
the
counter
make
ready
all
you
darling
jalisco
girls
of
my
heart
for
i
coming
along
too
quail
shouted
twisting
back
the
brim
of
his
hat
the
enthusiasm
and
rejoicing
were
general
demetrio
friends
in
the
excitement
of
drunkenness
offered
their
services
demetrio
was
so
happy
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
they
were
going
to
fight
orozco
and
his
men
at
last
they
would
pit
themselves
against
real
men
at
last
they
would
stop
shooting
down
the
federals
like
so
many
rabbits
or
wild
turkeys
if
i
could
get
hold
of
orozco
alive
blondie
said
i
rip
off
the
soles
of
his
feet
and
make
him
walk
hours
over
the
sierra
was
that
the
guy
who
killed
madero
asked
meco
no
blondie
replied
solemnly
but
once
when
i
was
a
waiter
at
monico
up
in
chihuahua
he
hit
me
in
the
face
give
camilla
the
roan
mare
demetrio
ordered
pancracio
who
was
already
saddling
the
horses
camilla
ca
go
said
war
paint
promptly
who
in
hell
asked
for
your
opinion
demetrio
retorted
angrily
it
true
is
it
camilla
you
were
sore
all
over
were
you
and
you
got
a
fever
right
now
well
anything
demetrio
says
do
be
a
fool
say
come
on
say
war
paint
whispered
nervously
into
camilla
ear
i
tell
you
war
paint
it
funny
but
i
beginning
to
fall
for
him
would
you
believe
it
camilla
whispered
back
war
paint
turned
purple
her
cheeks
swelled
without
a
word
she
went
out
to
get
her
horse
that
blondie
was
saddling
ix
a
whirlwind
of
dust
scorching
down
the
road
suddenly
broke
into
violent
diffuse
masses
and
demetrio
army
emerged
a
chaos
of
horses
broad
chests
tangled
manes
dilated
nostrils
oval
wide
eyes
hoofs
flying
in
the
air
legs
stiffened
from
endless
galloping
and
of
men
with
bronze
faces
ivory
teeth
and
flashing
eyes
their
rifles
in
their
hands
or
slung
across
the
saddles
demetrio
and
camilla
brought
up
the
rear
she
was
still
nervous
and
parched
he
was
angry
at
their
futile
maneuver
for
there
had
been
battles
no
followers
of
orozco
to
be
seen
a
handful
of
federals
routed
a
poor
devil
of
a
priest
left
dangling
from
a
mesquite
a
few
dead
scattered
over
the
field
who
had
once
been
united
under
the
archaic
slogan
rights
and
religion
with
on
their
breasts
the
red
cloth
insignia
halt
the
sacred
heart
of
jesus
is
with
me
one
good
thing
about
it
is
that
i
collected
all
my
back
pay
quail
said
exhibiting
some
gold
watches
and
rings
stolen
from
the
house
it
fun
fighting
this
way
manteca
cried
spicing
every
other
word
with
an
oath
you
know
why
the
hell
you
risking
your
hide
in
the
same
hand
with
which
he
held
the
reins
he
clutched
a
shining
ornament
that
he
had
torn
from
one
of
the
holy
statues
after
quail
an
expert
in
such
matters
had
examined
manteca
treasure
covetously
he
uttered
a
solemn
guffaw
hell
your
ornament
is
nothing
but
tin
why
in
hell
are
you
hanging
on
to
that
poison
pancracio
asked
blondie
who
appeared
dragging
a
prisoner
do
you
want
to
know
why
because
it
a
long
time
since
i
had
a
good
look
at
a
man
face
when
a
rope
tightens
around
his
neck
the
fat
prisoner
breathed
with
difficulty
as
he
followed
blondie
on
foot
his
face
was
sunburnt
his
eyes
red
his
forehead
beaded
with
sweat
his
wrists
tightly
bound
together
here
anastasio
lend
me
your
lasso
mine
not
strong
enough
this
bird
will
bust
it
no
by
god
i
changed
my
mind
friend
federal
think
i
kill
you
on
the
spot
because
you
are
pulling
too
hard
look
all
the
mesquites
are
still
a
long
way
off
and
there
are
no
telegraph
poles
to
hang
you
to
blondie
pulled
his
gun
out
pressed
the
muzzle
against
the
chest
and
brought
his
finger
against
the
trigger
slowly
slowly
the
prisoner
turned
pale
as
a
corpse
his
face
lengthened
his
eyelids
were
fixed
in
a
glassy
stare
he
breathed
in
agony
his
whole
body
shook
as
with
ague
blondie
kept
his
gun
in
the
same
position
for
a
moment
long
as
all
eternity
his
eyes
shone
queerly
an
expression
of
supreme
pleasure
lit
up
his
fat
puffy
face
no
friend
federal
he
drawled
putting
back
his
gun
into
the
holster
i
not
going
to
kill
you
just
yet
i
make
you
my
orderly
you
see
that
i
not
so
hardhearted
slyly
he
winked
at
his
companions
the
prisoner
had
turned
into
an
animal
he
gulped
panting
camilla
who
had
witnessed
the
scene
spurred
her
horse
and
caught
up
with
demetrio
what
a
brute
that
blondie
is
you
ought
to
see
what
he
did
to
a
wretched
prisoner
she
said
then
she
told
demetrio
what
had
occurred
the
latter
wrinkled
his
brow
but
made
no
answer
war
paint
called
camilla
aside
hey
you
what
are
you
gobbling
about
blondie
my
man
understand
from
now
on
you
know
how
things
are
whatever
you
got
against
him
you
got
against
me
too
i
warning
you
camilla
frightened
hurried
back
to
demetrio
side
x
the
men
camped
in
a
meadow
near
three
small
lone
houses
standing
in
a
row
their
white
walls
cutting
the
purple
fringe
of
the
horizon
demetrio
and
camilla
rode
toward
them
inside
the
corral
a
man
clad
in
shirt
and
trousers
of
cheap
white
cloth
sat
greedily
puffing
at
a
cornhusk
cigarette
another
man
sitting
beside
him
on
a
flat
cut
stone
was
shelling
corn
kicking
the
air
with
one
dry
withered
leg
the
extremity
of
which
was
like
a
goat
hoof
he
frightened
the
chickens
away
hurry
up
said
the
man
who
was
smoking
the
sun
has
gone
down
already
and
you
have
taken
the
animals
to
water
a
horse
neighed
outside
the
corral
both
men
glanced
up
in
amazement
demetrio
and
camilla
were
looking
over
the
corral
wall
at
them
i
just
want
a
place
to
sleep
for
my
woman
and
me
demetrio
said
reassuringly
as
he
explained
that
he
was
the
chief
of
a
small
army
which
was
to
camp
nearby
that
night
the
man
smoking
who
owned
the
place
bid
them
enter
with
great
deference
he
ran
to
fetch
a
broom
and
a
pail
of
water
to
dust
and
wash
the
best
corner
of
the
hut
as
decent
lodging
for
his
distinguished
guests
here
go
out
there
and
unsaddle
the
horses
the
man
who
was
shelling
corn
stood
up
with
an
effort
he
was
clad
in
a
tattered
shirt
and
vest
his
torn
trousers
split
at
the
seam
looked
like
the
wings
of
a
cold
stricken
bird
two
strings
of
cloth
dangled
from
his
waist
as
he
walked
he
described
grotesque
circles
surely
you
not
fit
to
do
any
work
demetrio
said
refusing
to
allow
him
to
touch
the
saddles
poor
man
the
owner
cried
from
within
the
hut
he
lost
all
his
strength
but
he
surely
works
for
his
pay
he
starts
working
the
minute
god
almighty
himself
gets
up
and
it
after
sundown
now
but
he
working
still
demetrio
went
out
with
camilla
for
a
stroll
about
the
encampment
the
meadow
golden
furrowed
stripped
even
of
the
smallest
bushes
extended
limitless
in
its
immense
desolation
the
three
tall
ash
trees
which
stood
in
front
of
the
small
house
with
dark
green
crests
round
and
waving
with
rich
foliage
and
branches
drooping
to
the
very
ground
seemed
a
veritable
miracle
i
do
know
why
but
i
feel
there
a
lot
of
sadness
around
here
said
demetrio
yes
camilla
answered
i
feel
that
way
too
on
the
bank
of
a
small
stream
was
strenuously
tugging
at
a
rope
with
a
large
can
tied
to
the
end
of
it
he
poured
a
stream
of
water
over
a
heap
of
fresh
cool
grass
in
the
twilight
the
water
glimmered
like
crystal
a
thin
cow
a
scrawny
nag
and
a
burro
drank
noisily
together
demetrio
recognized
the
limping
servant
and
asked
him
how
much
do
you
get
a
day
eight
cents
a
day
boss
he
was
an
insignificant
scrofulous
wraith
of
a
man
with
green
eyes
and
straight
fair
hair
he
whined
complaint
of
his
boss
the
ranch
his
bad
luck
his
dog
life
you
certainly
earn
your
pay
all
right
my
lad
demetrio
interrupted
kindly
you
complain
and
complain
but
you
are
no
loafer
you
work
and
work
then
aside
to
camilla
there
always
more
damned
fools
in
the
valley
than
among
us
folk
in
the
sierra
do
you
think
of
course
she
replied
they
went
on
the
valley
was
lost
in
darkness
stars
came
out
demetrio
put
his
arm
around
camilla
waist
amorously
and
whispered
in
her
ear
yes
she
answered
in
a
faint
voice
she
was
indeed
beginning
to
fall
for
him
as
she
had
expressed
it
demetrio
slept
badly
he
flung
out
of
the
house
very
early
something
is
going
to
happen
to
me
he
thought
it
was
a
silent
dawn
with
faint
murmurs
of
joy
a
thrush
sang
timidly
in
one
of
the
ash
trees
the
animals
in
the
corral
trampled
on
the
refuse
the
pig
grunted
its
somnolence
the
orange
tints
of
the
sun
streaked
the
sky
the
last
star
flickered
out
demetrio
walked
slowly
to
the
encampment
he
was
thinking
of
his
plow
his
two
black
oxen
young
beasts
they
were
who
had
worked
in
the
fields
only
two
years
of
his
two
acres
of
corn
the
face
of
his
young
wife
came
to
his
mind
clear
and
true
as
life
he
saw
her
strong
soft
features
so
gracious
when
she
smiled
on
her
husband
so
proudly
fierce
toward
strangers
but
when
he
tried
to
conjure
up
the
image
of
his
son
his
efforts
were
vain
he
had
forgotten
he
reached
the
camp
lying
among
the
farrows
the
soldiers
slept
with
the
horses
heads
bowed
eyes
closed
our
horses
are
pretty
tired
anastasio
i
think
we
ought
to
stay
here
at
least
another
day
well
compadre
demetrio
i
hankering
for
the
sierra
if
you
only
knew
you
may
not
believe
me
but
nothing
strikes
me
right
here
i
do
know
what
i
miss
but
i
know
i
miss
something
i
feel
sad
lost
how
many
hours
ride
from
here
to
limon
it
no
matter
of
hours
it
three
days
hard
riding
demetrio
you
know
demetrio
said
softly
i
feel
as
though
i
like
to
see
my
wife
again
shortly
after
war
paint
sought
out
camilla
that
one
on
you
my
dear
demetrio
going
to
leave
you
flat
he
told
me
so
himself
going
to
get
my
real
woman
he
says
and
he
says
skin
is
white
and
tender
and
her
rosy
cheeks
how
beautiful
she
is
but
you
do
have
to
leave
him
you
know
if
set
on
staying
well
they
got
a
child
you
know
and
i
suppose
you
could
drag
it
around
when
demetrio
returned
camilla
weeping
told
him
everything
do
pay
no
attention
to
that
crazy
baggage
it
all
lies
lies
since
demetrio
did
not
go
to
limon
or
remember
his
wife
again
camilla
grew
very
happy
war
paint
had
merely
stung
herself
like
a
scorpion
xi
before
dawn
they
left
for
tepatitlan
their
silhouettes
wavered
indistinctly
over
the
road
and
the
fields
that
bordered
it
rising
and
falling
with
the
monotonous
rhythmical
gait
of
their
horses
then
faded
away
in
the
nacreous
light
of
the
swooning
moon
that
bathed
the
valley
dogs
barked
in
the
distance
by
noon
we
reach
tepatitlan
cuquio
tomorrow
and
then
on
to
the
sierra
demetrio
said
do
you
think
it
advisable
to

luis
cervantes

thousand
pesos

cervantes
answered
in
a
low
voice
no
we
go
straight
to
the
sierra
we
see
later
on
yes
to
the
sierra
many
of
the
men
shouted
to
the
sierra
to
the
sierra
hurrah
for
the
mountains
the
plains
seemed
to
torture
them
they
spoke
with
enthusiasm
almost
with
delirium
of
the
sierra
they
thought
of
the
mountains
as
of
a
most
desirable
mistress
long
since
unvisited
dawn
broke
behind
a
cloud
of
fine
reddish
dust
the
sun
rose
an
immense
curtain
of
fiery
purple
luis
cervantes
pulled
his
reins
and
waited
for
quail

slightly
pale
then
he
cried
spiritedly
two
thousand
in
bills
for
the
whole
business
luis
cervantes
gave
himself
away
his
eyes
shone
with
such
an
obvious
greed
that
quail
recanted
and
said
oh

was
just
fooling

placed
them
in
quail
hands

them

over
the

against
the

quickly
converted
into

found
lodging
in
the
chapel
of
an
abandoned
church
the
soldiers
scattered
about
as
usual
pretending
to
seek
arms
and
horses
but
in
reality
for
the
sole
purpose
of
looting
in
the
afternoon
some
of
demetrio
men
lay
stretched
out
on
the
church
steps
scratching
their
bellies
venancio
his
chest
and
shoulders
bare
was
gravely
occupied
in
killing
the
fleas
in
his
shirt
a
man
drew
near
the
wall
and
sought
permission
to
speak
to
the
commander
the
soldiers
raised
their
heads
but
no
one
answered
i

widower

the
man
smiled
bitterly
she
only

fault
pancracio
observed
stretched
out
on
the
ground
staring
at
the
blue
sky
she
goes
mad
over
any
man
she
sees
they
laughed
loudly
but
venancio
with
utmost
gravity
pointed
to
the
chapel
door
the
stranger
entered
timidly
and
confided
his
troubles
to
demetrio
the
soldiers
had
cleaned
him
out
they
had
not
left
a
single
grain
of
corn
why
did
you
let
them
demetrio
asked
indolently
the
man
persisted
lamenting
and
weeping
luis
cervantes
was
about
to
throw
him
out
with
an
insult
but
camilla
intervened
come
on
demetrio
do
be
harsh
give
him
an
order
to
get
his
corn
back
luis
cervantes
was
obliged
to
obey
he
scrawled
a
few
lines
to
which
demetrio
appended
an
illegible
scratch
may
god
repay
you
my
child
god
will
lead
you
to
heaven
that
you
may
enjoy
his
glory
ten
bushels
of
corn
are
barely
enough
for
this
food
the
man
cried
weeping
for
gratitude
then
he
took
the
paper
kissed
everybody
hand
and
withdrew
xii
they
had
almost
reached
cuquio
when
anastasio
montanez
rode
up
to
demetrio
listen

i
almost
forgot
to
tell

he
did
with

to
complain
about

the
old
man
took
the
paper
and

blondie

and
blondie
pulled
out
his
sword
and
beat
him
till
he
cried
for
mercy
war
paint
rocked
in
her
saddle
convulsed
with
mirth
camilla
unable
to
control
herself
blurted
out
the
beast
his
heart
rotten
to
the
core
no
wonder
i
loathe
him
at

changed
what

to
you
she
scowled
camilla
frightened
spurred
her
horse
forward
war
paint
did
likewise
and
as
she
trotted
past
camilla
suddenly
she
reached
out
seized
the
other
hair
and
pulled
with
all
her
might
camilla
horse
shied
camilla
trying
to
brush
her
hair
back
from
over
her
eyes
abandoned
the
reins
she
hesitated
lost
her
balance
and
fell
in
the
road
striking
her
forehead
against
the
stones
war
paint
weeping
with
laughter
pressed
on
with
utmost
skill
and
caught
camilla
horse
come
on

job
for
you
pancracio
said
as
he
saw
camilla
on
demetrio
saddle
her
face
covered
with
blood
luis
cervantes
hurried
toward
her
with
some
cotton
but
camilla
choking
down
her
sobs
and
wiping
her
eyes
said
hoarsely
not
from
you
if
i
was
dying
i
would
accept
anything
from
you
not
even
water
in
cuquio
demetrio
received
a
message

got
to
go
back
to
tepatitlan

said
luis
cervantes
scanning
the
dispatch
rapidly
you
got
to
leave
the
men
there
while
you
go
to
lagos
and
take
the
train
over
to
aguascalientes
there
was
much
heated
protest
the
men
muttering
to
themselves
or
even
groaning
out
loud
some
of
them
mountaineers
swore
that
they
would
not
continue
with
the
troop
camilla
wept
all
night
on
the
morrow
at
dawn
she
begged
demetrio
to
let
her
return
home
if
you
do
like
me
all
right
he
answered
sullenly
that
not
the
reason
i
care
for
you
a
lot
really
but
you
know
how
it
is
that
woman
never
mind
about
her
it
all
right
i
send
her
off
to
hell
today
i
had
already
decided
that
camilla
dried
her
tears
every
horse
was
saddled
the
men
were
waiting
only
for
orders
from
the
chief
demetrio
went
up
to
war
paint
and
said
under
his
breath
you
not
coming
with
us
what
she
gasped
you
going
to
stay
here
or
go
wherever
you
damn
well
please
but
you
not
coming
along
with
us
what
what
that
you
saying
still
she
could
not
catch
meaning
then
the
truth
dawned
upon
her
you
want
to
send
me
away
by
god
i
suppose
you
believe
all
the
filth
that
bitch
and
war
paint
proceeded
to
insult
camilla
luis
cervantes
demetrio
and
anyone
she
happened
to
remember
at
the
moment
with
such
power
and
originality
that
the
soldiers
listened
in
wonder
to
vituperation
that
transcended
their
wildest
dream
of
profanity
and
filth
demetrio
waited
a
long
time
patiently
then
as
she
showed
no
sign
of
stopping
he
said
to
a
soldier
quite
calmly
throw
this
drunken
woman
out
blondie
blondie
love
of
my
life
help
come
and
show
them
you
a
real
man
show
them
they
nothing
but
sons
of
bitches
she
gesticulated
kicked
and
shouted
blondie
appeared
he
had
just
got
up
his
blue
eyes
blinked
under
heavy
lids
his
voice
rang
hoarse
he
asked
what
had
occurred
someone
explained
then
he
went
up
to
war
paint
and
with
great
seriousness
said
yes
really
well
if
you
want
my
opinion
i
think
this
is
just
what
ought
to
happen
so
far
as
i
concerned
you
can
go
straight
to
hell
we
all
fed
up
with
you
see
war
paint
face
turned
to
granite
she
tried
to
speak
but
her
muscles
were
rigid
the
soldiers
laughed
camilla
terrified
held
her
breath
war
paint
stared
slowly
at
everyone
about
her
it
all
took
no
more
than
a
few
seconds
in
a
trice
she
bent
down
drew
a
sharp
gleaming
dagger
from
her
stocking
and
leapt
at
camilla
a
shrill
cry
a
body
fell
the
blood
spurting
from
it
kill
her
goddamn
it
cried
demetrio
beyond
himself
kill
her
two
soldiers
fell
upon
war
paint
but
she
brandished
her
dagger
defying
them
to
touch
her
not
the
likes
of
you
goddamn
you
kill
me
yourself
demetrio
war
paint
stepped
forward
surrendered
her
dagger
and
thrusting
her
breast
forward
let
her
arms
fall
to
her
side
demetrio
picked
up
the
dagger
red
with
blood
but
his
eyes
clouded
he
hesitated
took
a
step
backward
then
with
a
heavy
hoarse
voice
he
growled
enraged
get
out
of
here
quick
no
one
dared
stop
her
she
moved
off
slowly
mute
somber
blondie
shrill
guttural
voice
broke
the
silent
stupor
thank
god
at
last
i
rid
of
that
damned
louse
xiii
someone
plunged
a
knife
deep
in
my
side
did
he
know
why
i
do
know
why
maybe
he
knew
i
never
knew
the
blood
flowed
out
of
that
mortal
wound
did
he
know
why
i
do
know
why
maybe
he
knew
i
never
knew
his
head
lowered
his
hands
crossed
over
the
pommel
of
his
saddle
demetrio
in
melancholy
accents
sang
the
strains
of
the
intriguing
song
then
he
fell
silent
for
quite
a
while
he
continued
to
feel
oppressed
and
sad
you
see
as
soon
as
we
reach
lagos
you
come
out
of
it
general
there
plenty
of
pretty
girls
to
give
us
a
good
time
blondie
said
right
now
i
feel
like
getting
damn
drunk
demetrio
answered
spurring
his
horse
forward
and
leaving
them
as
if
he
wished
to
abandon
himself
entirely
to
his
sadness
after
many
hours
of
riding
he
called
cervantes
listen
tenderfoot

in
hell

they
reached

blondie
bet
that
he
would
make
demetrio
laugh
that
evening
trailing
his
spurs
noisily
over
the
pavement
demetrio
entered
el
cosmopolita
with
luis
cervantes
blondie
and
his
assistants
the
civilians
surprised
in
their
attempt
to
escape
remained
where
they
were
some
feigned
to
return
to
their
tables
to
continue
drinking
and
talking

hesitantly
stepped
up
to
present
their
respects
to
the
commander

so
pleased
major
delighted
to
meet
you

i
love

blondie
said
come

boys
he
added
jovially
drawing
his
gun
i
going
to
play
a
tune
that
make
you
all
dance
a
bullet
ricocheted
on
the
cement
floor
passing
between
the
legs
of
the
tables
and
the
smartly
dressed
young
began
to
jump
much
as
a
woman
jumps
when
frightened
by
a
mouse
under
her
skirt
pale
as
ghosts
they
conjured
up
wan
smiles
of
obsequious
approval
demetrio
barely
parted
his
lips
but
his
followers
doubled
over
with
laughter
look
blondie
quail
shouted
look
at
that
man
going
out
there
look
he
limping
i
guess
the
bee
stung
him
all
right
blondie
without
turning
to
look
at
the
wounded
man
announced
with
enthusiasm
that
he
could
shoot
off
the
top
of
a
tequila
bottle
at
thirty
paces
without
aiming
come
on
friend

up
he
said
to
the
waiter
he
dragged
him
out
by
the
hand
to
the
patio
of
the
hotel
and
set
a
tequila
bottle
on
his
head
the
poor
devil
refused
insane
with
fright
he
sought
to
escape
but
blondie
pulled
his
gun
and
took
aim

to
the
opposite
wall

his
gun
and
fired

bottle

into
bits
the
alcohol
poured
over
the
lad
ghastly

blondie
running
to
the
bar
to
get
another
bottle
which
he
placed
on
the
lad
head
he
returned
to
his
former
position
he
whirled
about
and
shot
without
aiming
but
he
hit
the
waiter
ear
instead
of
the
bottle
holding
his
sides
with
laughter
he
said
to
the
young
waiter

chief
the
bartender
answered
amiably
quickly
blondie
jumped
behind
the
bar
and
with
a
sweep
of
both
arms
knocked
down
all
the
glasses
and
bottles
send
the
bill
to
general
villa

he
left
laughing
loudly
at
his
prank
say
there
you
where
do
the
girls
hang
out
blondie
asked
reeling
up
drunkenly
toward
a
small
man
standing
at
the
door
of
a
tailor
shop
the
man
stepped
down
to
the
sidewalk
politely
to
let
blondie
pass
blondie
stopped
and
looked
at
him
curiously
impertinently
little
boy
you
very
small
and
dainty
ai
you
no
then
i
a
liar
that
right
you
know
the
puppet
dance

hell

do
i
met
you
in
a
circus
i
know
you
can
even
dance
on
a
tightrope
you
watch
blondie
drew
his
gun
out
and
began
to
shoot
aiming
at
the
feet
the
tailor
gave
a
little
jump
at
every
pull
of
the
trigger
see
you
do
know
how
to
dance
on
the
tightrope
do
you
taking
his
friends
by
the
arm
he
ordered
them
to
lead
him
to
the
district
punctuating
every
step
by
a
shot
which
smashed
a
street
light
or
struck
some
wall
a
door
or
a
distant
house
demetrio
left
him
and
returned
to
the
hotel
singing
to
himself
someone
plunged
a
knife
deep
in
my
side
did
he
know
why
i
do
know
why
maybe
he
knew
i
never
knew
xiv
stale
cigarette
smoke
the
acrid
odors
of
sweaty
clothing
the
vapors
of
alcohol
the
breathing
of
a
crowded
multitude
worse
by
far
than
a
trainful
of
pigs
texas
hats
adorned
with
gold
braid
and
khaki
predominate
gentlemen
a
man
stole
my
suitcase
in
the
station
my
life
savings
i
have
enough
to
feed
my
little
boy
now
the
shrill
voice
rising
to
a
shriek
or
trailing
off
into
a
sob
is
drowned
out
by
the
tumult
within
the
train
what
the
hell
is
the
old
woman
talking
about
blondie
asks
entering
in
search
of
a
seat
something
about
a
suitcase
and
a
man
pancracio
replies
he
has
already
the
laps
of
two
civilians
to
sit
on
demetrio
and
the
others
elbow
their
way
in
since
those
on
whom
pancracio
had
sat
preferred
to
stand
up
demetrio
and
luis
cervantes
quickly
seize
the
vacant
seats
suddenly
a
woman
who
has
stood
up
holding
a
child
all
the
way
from
irapuato
faints
a
civilian
takes
the
child
in
his
arms
the
others
pretend
to
have
seen
nothing
some
women
traveling
with
the
soldiers
occupy
two
or
three
seats
with
baggage
dogs
cats
parrots
some
of
the
men
wearing
texan
hats
laugh
at
the
plump
arms
and
pendulous
breasts
of
the
woman
who
fainted
gentlemen
a
man
stole
my
suitcase
at
the
station
in
silao
all
my
life
savings
i
have
got
enough
to
feed
my
little
boy
now
the
old
woman
speaks
rapidly
parrotlike
sighing
and
sobbing
her
sharp
eyes
peer
about
on
all
sides
here
she
gets
a
bill
and
further
on
another
they
shower
money
upon
her
she
finishes
the
collection
and
goes
a
few
seats
ahead
gentlemen
a
man
stole
my
suitcase
in
the
station
at
silao
her
words
produce
an
immediate
and
certain
effect
a
man
a
dude
a
tenderfoot
stealing
a
suitcase
amazing
phenomenal
it
awakens
a
feeling
of
universal
indignation
it
a
pity
if
this
man
were
here
every
one
of
the
generals
would
shoot
him
one
after
the
other
there
nothing
as
vile
as
a
city
dude
who
steals
a
man
says
exploding
with
indignation
to
rob
a
poor
old
lady
to
steal
from
a
poor
defenseless
woman
they
prove
their
compassion
by
word
and
deed
a
harsh
verdict
against
the
culprit
a
bill
for
the
victim
and
i
telling
you
the
truth
blondie
declares
do
think
wrong
to
kill
because
when
you
kill
it
always
out
of
anger
but
stealing
bah
this
profound
piece
of
reasoning
meets
with
unanimous
assent
after
a
short
silence
while
he
meditates
a
colonel
ventures
his
opinion
everything
is
all
right
according
to
something
see
that
is
everything
has
its
circumstances
see
god
own
truth
is
this
i
have
stolen
and
if
i
say
that
everyone
here
has
done
the
trick
i
not
telling
a
lie
i
reckon
hell
i
stole
a
lot
of
them
sewing
machines
in
mexico
exclaims
a
major
i
made
five
hundred
pesos
even
though
i
sold
them
at
fifty
cents
apiece
a
toothless
captain
with
hair
prematurely
white
announces
i
stole
some
horses
in
zacatecas
all
damn
fine
horses
they
was
and
then
i
says
to
myself
is
your
own
little
lottery
pascual
mata
i
says
wo
have
a
worry
in
all
your
life
after
this
and
the
damned
thing
about
it
was
that
general
limon
took
a
fancy
to
the
horses
too
and
he
stole
them
from
me
of
course
there
no
use
denying
it
i
stolen
too
blondie
confesses
but
ask
any
one
of
my
partners
how
much
profit
i
got
i
a
big
spender
and
my
purse
is
my
friends
to
have
a
good
time
on
i
have
a
better
time
if
i
drink
myself
senseless
than
i
would
have
sending
money
back
home
to
the

the
subject
of

stole
though
apparently
inexhaustible
ceases
to
hold
the
men
attention
decks
of
cards
gradually
appear
on
the
seats
drawing
generals
and
officers
as
the
light
draws
mosquitoes
the
excitement
of
gambling
soon
absorbs
every
interest
the
heat
grows
more
and
more
intense
to
breathe
is
to
inhale
the
air
of
barracks
prison
brothel
and
pigsty
all
in
one
and
rising
above
the
babble
from
the
car

the
shrill
voice
gentlemen
a
young
man
stole
the
streets
in
aguascalientes
were
so
many
refuse
piles
men
in
khaki
moved
to
and
fro
like
bees
before
their
hive
overrunning
the
restaurants
the
crapulous
lunch
houses
the
parlous
hotels
and
the
stands
of
the
street
vendors
on
which
rotten
pork
lay
alongside
grimy
cheese
the
smell
of
these
viands
whetted
the
appetites
of
demetrio
and
his
men
they
forced
their
way
into
a
small
inn
where
a
disheveled
old
hag
served
on
earthenware
plates
some
pork
with
bones
swimming
in
a
clear
chili
stew
and
three
tough
burnt
tortillas
they
paid
two
pesos
apiece
as
they
left
pancracio
assured
his
comrades
he
was
hungrier
than
when
he
entered
now
said
demetrio
we
go
and
consult
with
general
natera
they
made
for
the
northern
leader
billet
a
noisy
excited
crowd
stopped
them
at
a
street
crossing
a
man
lost
in
the
multitude
was
mouthing
words
in
the
monotonous
unctuous
tones
of
a
prayer
they
came
up
close
enough
to
see
him
distinctly
he
wore
a
shirt
and
trousers
of
cheap
white
cloth
and
was
repeating
all
good
catholics
should
read
this
prayer
to
christ
our
lord
upon
the
cross
with
due
devotion
thus
they
will
be
immune
from
storms
and
pestilence
famine
and
war
this
man
no
fool
said
demetrio
smiling
the
man
waved
a
sheaf
of
printed
handbills
in
his
hand
and
cried
a
quarter
of
a
peso
is
all
you
have
to
pay
for
this
prayer
to
christ
our
lord
upon
the
cross
a
quarter
then
he
would
duck
for
a
moment
to
reappear
with
a
snake
tooth
a
sea
star
or
the
skeleton
of
a
fish
in
the
same
predicant
tone
he
lauded
the
medical
virtues
and
the
mystical
powers
of
every
article
he
sold
quail
who
had
no
faith
in
venancio
requested
the
man
to
pull
a
tooth
out

purchased
a
black
seed
from
a
certain
fruit
which

the
possessor
from

catastrophe
anastasio
montanez
purchased
a
prayer
to
christ
our
lord
upon
the
cross
and
folding
it
carefully
stuck
it
into
his
shirt
with
a
pious
gesture
as
sure
as
there
a
god
in
heaven
natera
said
this
mess
blown
over
yet
now
it
villa
fighting
carranza
without
answering
him
his
eyes
fixed
in
a
stare
demetrio
demanded
a
further
explanation
it
means
natera
said
that
the
convention
wo
recognize
carranza
as
first
chief
of
the
constitutionalist
army
it
going
to
elect
a
provisional
president
of
the
republic
do
you
understand
me
general
demetrio
nodded
assent
what
your
opinion
general
asked
natera
demetrio
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
seems
to
me
that
the
meat
of
the
matter
is
that
we
got
to
go
on
fighting
eh
all
right
let
go
to
it
i
game
to
the
end
you
know
good
but
on
what
side
demetrio
nonplussed
scratched
his
head
look
here
do
ask
me
any
more
questions
i
never
went
to
school
you
know
you
gave
me
the
eagle
i
wear
on
my
hat
did
you
all
right
then
you
just
tell
me
do
this
or
do
that
and
that
all
there
to
it
part

villa
obregon
carranza
what
the
difference
i
love
the
revolution
like
a
volcano
in
eruption
i
love
the
volcano
because
it
a
volcano
the
revolution
because
it
the

i
el
paso
texas
may
my
dear
venancio
due
to
the
pressure
of
professional
duties
i
have
been
unable
to
answer
your
letter
of
january
before
now
as
you
already
know
i
was
graduated
last
december
i
was
sorry
to
hear
of
pancracio
and
manteca
fate
though
i
am
not
surprised
that
they
stabbed
each
other
over
the
gambling
table
it
is
a
pity
they
were
both
brave
men
i
am
deeply
grieved
not
to
be
able
to
tell
blondie
how
sincerely
and
heartily
i
congratulate
him
for
the
only
noble
and
beautiful
thing
he
ever
did
in
his
whole
life
to
have
shot
himself
dear
venancio
although
you
may
have
enough
money
to
purchase
a
degree
i
am
afraid
you
wo
find
it
very
easy
to
become
a
doctor
in
this
country
you
know
i
like
you
very
much
venancio
and
i
think
you
deserve
a
better
fate
but
i
have
an
idea
which
may
prove
profitable
to
both
of
us
and
which
may
improve
your
social
position
as
you
desire
we
could
do
a
fine
business
here
if
we
were
to
go
in
as
partners
and
set
up
a
typical
mexican
restaurant
in
this
town
i
have
no
reserve
funds
at
the
moment
since
i
spent
all
i
had
in
getting
my
college
degree
but
i
have
something
much
more
valuable
than
money
my
perfect
knowledge
of
this
town
and
its
needs
you
can
appear
as
the
owner
we
will
make
a
monthly
division
of
profits
besides
concerning
a
question
that
interests
us
both
very
much
namely
your
social
improvement
it
occurs
to
me
that
you
play
the
guitar
quite
well
in
view
of
the
recommendations
i
could
give
you
and
in
view
of
your
training
as
well
you
might
easily
be
admitted
as
a
member
of
some
fraternal
order
there
are
several
here
which
would
bring
you
no
inconsiderable
social
prestige
do
hesitate
venancio
come
at
once
and
bring
your
funds
i
promise
you
we
get
rich
in
no
time
my
best
wishes
to
the
general
to
anastasio
and
the
rest
of
the
boys
your
affectionate
friend
luis
cervantes
venancio
finished
reading
the
letter
for
the
hundredth
time
and
sighing
repeated
tenderfoot
certainly
knows
how
to
pull
the
strings
all
right
what
i
ca
get
into
my
head
observed
anastasio
montanez
is
why
we
keep
on
fighting
did
we
finish
off
this
man
huerta
and
his
federation
neither
the
general
nor
venancio
answered
but
the
same
thought
kept
beating
down
on
their
dull
brains
like
a
hammer
on
an
anvil
they
ascended
the
steep
hill
their
heads
bowed
pensive
their
horses
walking
at
a
slow
gait
stubbornly
restless
anastasio
made
the
same
observation
to
other
groups
the
soldiers
laughed
at
his
candor
if
a
man
has
a
rifle
in
his
hands
and
a
beltful
of
cartridges
surely
he
should
use
them
that
means
fighting
against
whom
for
whom
that
is
scarcely
a
matter
of
importance
the
endless
wavering
column
of
dust
moved
up
the
trail
a
swirling
ant
heap
of
broad
straw
sombreros
dirty
khaki
faded
blankets
and
black
horses
not
a
man
but
was
dying
of
thirst
no
pool
or
stream
or
well
anywhere
along
the
road
a
wave
of
dust
rose
from
the
white
wild
sides
of
a
small
canyon
swayed
mistily
on
the
hoary
crest
of
huizache
trees
and
the
greenish
stumps
of
cactus
like
a
jest
the
flowers
in
the
cactus
opened
out
fresh
solid
aflame
some
thorny
others
diaphanous
at
noon
they
reached
a
hut
clinging
to
the
precipitous
sierra
then
three
more
huts
strewn
over
the
margin
of
a
river
of
burnt
sand
everything
was
silent
desolate
as
soon
as
they
saw
men
on
horseback
the
people
in
the
huts
scurried
into
the
hills
to
hide
demetrio
grew
indignant
bring
me
anyone
you
find
hiding
or
running
away
he
commanded
in
a
loud
voice
what
what
did
you
say
valderrama
cried
in
surprise
the
men
of
the
sierra
those
brave
men
who
not
yet
done
what
those
chickens
down
in
aguascalientes
and
zacatecas
have
done
all
the
time
our
own
brothers
who
weather
storms
who
cling
to
the
rocks
like
moss
itself
i
protest
sir
i
protest
he
spurred
his
miserable
horse
forward
and
caught
up
with
the
general
the
mountaineers
he
said
solemnly
and
emphatically
are
flesh
of
our
flesh
bone
of
our
bone
os
ex
osibus
meis
et
caro
de
carne
mea
mountaineers
are
made
from
the
same
timber
we
made
of
of
the
same
sound
timber
from
which
heroes
with
a
confidence
as
sudden
as
it
was
courageous
he
hit
the
general
across
the
chest
the
general
smiled
benevolently
valderrama
the
tramp
the
crazy
maker
of
verses
did
he
ever
know
what
he
said
when
the
soldiers
reached
a
small
ranch
despairingly
they
searched
the
empty
huts
and
small
houses
without
finding
a
single
stale
tortilla
a
solitary
rotten
pepper
or
one
pinch
of
salt
with
which
to
flavor
the
horrible
taste
of
dry
meat
the
owners
of
the
huts
their
peaceful
brethren
were
impassive
with
the
stonelike
impassivity
of
aztec
idols
others
more
human
with
a
slow
smile
on
their
colorless
lips
and
beardless
faces
watched
these
fierce
men
who
less
than
a
month
ago
had
made
the
miserable
huts
of
others
tremble
with
fear
now
in
their
turn
fleeing
their
own
huts
where
the
ovens
were
cold
and
the
water
tanks
dry
fleeing
with
their
tails
between
their
legs
cringing
like
curs
kicked
out
of
their
own
houses
but
the
general
did
not
countermand
his
order
some
soldiers
brought
back
four
fugitives
captive
and
bound
ii
why
do
you
hide
demetrio
asked
the
prisoners
we
not
hiding
chief
we
hitting
the
trail
where
to
to
our
own
homes
in
god
name
to
durango
is
this
the
road
to
durango
peaceful
people
ca
travel
over
the
main
road
nowadays
you
know
that
chief
you
not
peaceful
people
you
deserters
where
do
you
come
from
demetrio
said
eyeing
them
with
keen
scrutiny
the
prisoners
grew
confused
they
looked
at
each
other
hesitatingly
unable
to
give
a
prompt
answer
they
carranzistas
one
of
the
soldiers
said
carranzistas
hell
one
of
them
said
proudly
i
rather
be
a
pig
the
truth
is
we
deserters
another
said
after
the
defeat
we
deserted
from
general
villa
troops
this
side
of
celaya
general
villa
defeated
ha
ha
that
a
good
joke
the
soldiers
laughed
but
demetrio
brow
was
wrinkled
as
though
a
black
shadow
had
passed
over
his
eyes
there
ai
a
son
of
a
bitch
on
earth
who
can
beat
general
villa
said
a
bronzed
veteran
with
a
scar
clear
across
the
face
without
a
change
of
expression
one
of
the
deserters
stared
persistently
at
him
and
said
i
know
who
you
are
when
we
took
torreon
you
were
with
general
urbina
in
zacatecas
you
were
with
general
natera
and
then
you
shifted
to
the
jalisco
troops
am
i
lying
these
words
met
with
a
sudden
and
definite
effect
the
prisoners
gave
a
detailed
account
of
the
tremendous
defeat
of
villa
at
celaya
demetrio
men
listened
in
silence
stupefied
before
resuming
their
march
they
built
a
fire
on
which
to
roast
some
bull
meat
anastasio
montanez
searching
for
food
among
the
huizache
trees
descried
the
neck
of
valderrama
horse
in
the
distance
among
the
rocks
hey
come
here
you
fool
after
all
there
ai
been
no
gravy
he
shouted
whenever
anything
was
said
about
shooting
someone
valderrama
the
romantic
poet
would
disappear
for
a
whole
day
hearing
anastasio
voice
valderrama
was
convinced
that
the
prisoners
had
been
set
at
liberty
a
few
moments
later
he
was
joined
by
venancio
and
demetrio
heard
the
news
venancio
asked
gravely
no
it
very
serious
a
terrible
mess
villa
was
beaten
at
celaya
by
obregon
and
carranza
is
winning
all
along
the
line
we
done
for
valderrama
gesture
was
disdainful
and
solemn
as
an
emperor
villa
obregon
carranza
what
the
difference
i
love
the
revolution
like
a
volcano
in
eruption
i
love
the
volcano
because
it
a
volcano
the
revolution
because
it
the
revolution
what
do
i
care
about
the
stones
left
above
or
below
after
the
cataclysm
what
are
they
to
me
in
the
glare
of
the
midday
sun
the
reflection
of
a
white
tequila
bottle
glittered
on
his
forehead
and
jubilant
he
ran
toward
the
bearer
of
such
a
marvelous
gift
i
like
this
crazy
fool
demetrio
said
with
a
smile
he
says
things
sometimes
that
make
you
think
they
resumed
their
march
their
uncertainty
translated
into
a
lugubrious
silence
slowly
inevitably
the
catastrophe
must
come
it
was
even
now
being
realized
villa
defeated
was
a
fallen
god
when
gods
cease
to
be
omnipotent
they
are
nothing
quail
spoke
his
words
faithfully
interpreted
the
general
opinion
what
the
hell
boys
every
spider
got
to
spin
his
own
web
now
iii
in
zacatecas
and
aguascalientes
in
the
little
country
towns
and
the
neighboring
communities
haciendas
and
ranches
were
deserted
when
one
of
the
officers
found
a
barrel
of
tequila
the
event
assumed
miraculous
proportions
everything
was
conducted
with
secrecy
and
care
deep
mystery
was
preserved
to
oblige
the
soldiers
to
leave
on
the
morrow
before
sunrise
under
anastasio
and
venancio
when
demetrio
awoke
to
the
strains
of
music
his
general
staff
now
composed
chiefly
of
young
officers
told
him
of
the
discovery
and
quail
interpreting
the
thoughts
of
his
colleagues
said
sententiously
these
are
bad
times
and
you
got
to
take
advantage
of
everythin
if
there
are
some
days
when
a
duck
can
swim
there
others
when
he
take
a
drink
the
string
musicians
played
all
day
the
most
solemn
honors
were
paid
to
the
barrel
but
demetrio
was
very
sad
did
he
know
why
i
do
know
why
he
kept
repeating
the
same
refrain
in
the
afternoon
there
were
cockfights
demetrio
sat
down
with
the
chief
officers
under
the
roof
of
the
municipal
portals
in
front
of
a
city
square
covered
with
weeds
a
tumbled
kiosk
and
some
abandoned
adobe
houses
valderrama
demetrio
called
looking
away
from
the
ring
with
tired
eyes
come
and
sing
me
a
song
sing
undertaker
but
valderrama
did
not
hear
him
he
had
no
eyes
for
the
fight
he
was
reciting
an
impassioned
soliloquy
as
he
watched
the
sunset
over
the
hills
with
solemn
gestures
and
emphatic
tones
he
said
o
lord
lord
pleasurable
it
is
this
thy
land
i
shall
build
me
three
tents
one
for
thee
one
for
moses
one
for
elijah
valderrama
demetrio
shouted
again
come
and
sing
song
for
me
hey
crazy
the
general
is
calling
you
an
officer
shouted
valderrama
with
his
eternally
complacent
smile
went
over
to
seat
and
asked
the
musicians
for
a
guitar
silence
the
gamesters
cried
valderrama
finished
tuning
his
instrument
quail
and
meco
let
loose
on
the
sand
a
pair
of
cocks
armed
with
long
sharp
blades
attached
to
their
legs
one
was
light
red
his
feathers
shone
with
beautiful
obsidian
glints
the
other
was
with
feathers
like
scales
burned
slowly
to
a
fiery
copper
color
the
fight
was
swift
and
fierce
as
a
duel
between
men
as
though
moved
by
springs
the
roosters
flew
at
each
other
their
feathers
stood
up
on
their
arched
necks
their
combs
were
erect
their
legs
taut
for
an
instant
they
swung
in
the
air
without
even
touching
the
ground
their
feathers
beaks
and
claws
lost
in
a
dizzy
whirlwind
the
red
rooster
suddenly
broke
tossed
with
his
legs
to
heaven
outside
the
chalk
lines
his
vermilion
eyes
closed
slowly
revealing
eyelids
of
pink
coral
his
tangled
feathers
quivered
and
shook
convulsively
amid
a
pool
of
blood
valderrama
who
could
not
repress
a
gesture
of
violent
indignation
began
to
play
with
the
first
melancholy
strains
of
the
tune
his
anger
disappeared
his
eyes
gleamed
with
the
light
of
madness
his
glance
strayed
over
the
square
the
tumbled
kiosk
the
old
adobe
houses
over
the
mountains
in
the
background
and
over
the
sky
burning
like
a
roof
afire
he
began
to
sing
he
put
such
feeling
into
his
voice
and
such
expression
into
the
strings
that
as
he
finished
demetrio
turned
his
head
aside
to
hide
his
tears
but
valderrama
fell
upon
him
embraced
him
warmly
and
with
a
familiarity
he
showed
everyone
at
the
appropriate
moment
he
whispered
drink
them
those
are
beautiful
tears
demetrio
asked
for
the
bottle
passed
it
to
valderrama
greedily
the
poet
drank
half
its
contents
in
one
gulp
then
showing
only
the
whites
of
his
eyes
he
faced
the
spectators
dramatically
and
in
a
highly
theatrical
voice
cried
here
you
may
witness
the
blessings
of
the
revolution
caught
in
a
single
tear
then
he
continued
to
talk
like
a
madman
but
like
a
madman
whose
vast
prophetic
madness
encompassed
all
about
him
the
dusty
weeds
the
tumbled
kiosk
the
gray
houses
the
lovely
hills
and
the
immeasurable
sky
iv
juchipila
rose
in
the
distance
white
bathed
in
sunlight
shining
in
the
midst
of
a
thick
forest
at
the
foot
of
a
proud
lofty
mountain
pleated
like
a
turban
some
of
the
soldiers
gazing
at
the
spire
of
the
church
sighed
sadly
they
marched
forward
through
the
canyon
uncertain
unsteady
as
blind
men
walking
without
a
hand
to
guide
them
the
bitterness
of
the
exodus
pervaded
them
is
that
town
juchipila
valderrama
asked
in
the
first
stage
of
his
drunkenness
valderrama
had
been
counting
the
crosses
scattered
along
the
road
along
the
trails
in
the
hollows
near
the
rocks
in
the
tortuous
paths
and
along
the
riverbanks
crosses
of
black
timber
newly
varnished
makeshift
crosses
built
out
of
two
logs
crosses
of
stones
piled
up
and
plastered
together
crosses
whitewashed
on
crumbling
walls
humble
crosses
drawn
with
charcoal
on
the
surface
of
whitish
rocks
the
traces
of
the
first
blood
shed
by
the
revolutionists
of
murdered
by
the
government
before
juchipila
was
lost
from
sight
valderrama
got
off
his
horse
bent
down
kneeled
and
gravely
kissed
the
ground
the
soldiers
passed
by
without
stopping
some
laughed
at
the
crazy
man
others
jested
valderrama
deaf
to
all
about
him
breathed
his
unctuous
prayer
o
juchipila
cradle
of
the
revolution
of
o
blessed
land
land
steeped
in
the
blood
of
martyrs
blood
of
dreamers
the
only
true
men
because
they
had
no
time
to
be
bad
an
officer
interjected
as
he
rode
interrupting
his
prayer
valderrama
frowned
burst
into
stentorian
laughter
reechoed
by
the
rocks
and
ran
toward
the
officer
begging
for
a
swallow
of
tequila
soldiers
minus
an
arm
or
leg
cripples
rheumatics
and
consumptives
spoke
bitterly
of
demetrio
young
whippersnappers
were
given
commissions
and
wore
stripes
on
their
hats
without
a
day
service
even
before
they
knew
how
to
handle
a
rifle
while
the
veterans
exhausted
in
a
hundred
battles
now
incapacitated
for
work
the
veterans
who
had
set
out
as
simple
privates
were
still
simple
privates
the
few
remaining
officers
among
demetrio
friends
also
grumbled
because
his
staff
was
made
up
of
wealthy
dapper
young
men
who
oiled
their
hair
and
used
perfume
the
worst
part
of
it
venancio
said
is
that
we
overcrowded
with
federals
anastasio
himself
who
invariably
found
only
praise
for
conduct
now
seemed
to
share
the
general
discontent
see
here
brothers
he
said
i
spits
out
the
truth
when
i
sees
something
i
always
tell
the
boss
that
if
these
people
stick
to
us
very
long
we
be
in
a
hell
of
a
fix
certainly
how
can
anyone
think
otherwise
i
no
hair
on
my
tongue
and
by
the
mother
that
bore
me
i
going
to
tell
demetrio
so
myself
demetrio
listened
benevolently
and
when
anastasio
had
finished
he
replied
you
right
there
no
gettin
around
it
we
in
a
bad
way
the
soldiers
grumble
about
the
officers
the
officers
grumble
about
us
see
and
we
damn
well
ready
now
to
send
both
villa
and
carranza
to
hell
to
have
a
good
time
all
by
themselves
i
guess
we
in
the
same
fix
as
that
peon
from
tepatitlan
who
complained
about
his
boss
all
day
long
but
worked
on
just
the
same
that
us
we
kick
and
kick
but
we
keep
on
killing
and
killing
but
there
no
use
in
saying
anything
to
them
why
demetrio
hm
i
do
know
because
because
do
you
see
what
we
got
to
do
is
to
make
the
men
toe
the
mark
i
got
orders
to
stop
a
band
of
men
coming
through
cuquio
see
in
a
few
days
we
have
to
fight
the
carranzistas
it
will
be
great
to
beat
the
hell
out
of
them
valderrama
the
tramp
who
had
enlisted
in
demetrio
army
one
day
without
anyone
remembering
the
time
or
the
place
overheard
some
of
demetrio
words
fools
do
not
eat
fire
that
very
day
valderrama
disappeared
mysteriously
as
he
had
come
v
they
entered
the
streets
of
juchipila
as
the
church
bells
rang
loud
and
joyfully
with
that
peculiar
tone
that
thrills
every
mountaineer
it
makes
me
think
we
are
back
in
the
days
when
the
revolution
was
just
beginning
when
the
bells
rang
like
mad
in
every
town
we
entered
and
everybody
came
out
with
music
flags
cheers
and
fireworks
to
welcome
us
said
anastasio
montanez
they
do
like
us
no
more
demetrio
returned
of
course
we
crawling
back
like
a
dog
with
its
tail
between
its
legs
quail
remarked
it
ai
that
i
guess
they
do
give
a
whoop
for
the
other
side
either
but
why
should
they
like
us
they
spoke
no
more
presently
they
reached
the
city
square
and
stopped
in
front
of
an
octagonal
rough
massive
church
reminiscent
of
the
colonial
period
at
one
time
the
square
must
have
been
a
garden
judging
from
the
bare
stunted
orange
trees
planted
between
iron
and
wooden
benches
the
sonorous
joyful
bells
rang
again
from
within
the
church
the
honeyed
voices
of
a
female
chorus
rose
melancholy
and
grave
to
the
strains
of
a
guitar
the
young
girls
of
the
town
sang
the
mysteries
what
the
fiesta
lady
venancio
asked
of
an
old
woman
who
was
running
toward
the
church
the
sacred
heart
of
jesus
answered
the
pious
woman
panting
they
remembered
that
one
year
ago
they
had
captured
zacatecas
they
grew
sadder
still
juchipila
like
the
other
towns
they
had
passed
through
on
their
way
from
tepic
by
way
of
jalisco
aguascalientes
and
zacatecas
was
in
ruins
the
black
trail
of
the
incendiaries
showed
in
the
roofless
houses
in
the
burnt
arcades
almost
all
the
houses
were
closed
yet
here
and
there
those
still
open
offered
in
ironic
contrast
portals
gaunt
and
bare
as
the
white
skeletons
of
horses
scattered
over
the
roads
the
terrible
pangs
of
hunger
seemed
to
speak
from
every
face
hunger
on
every
dusty
cheek
in
their
dusty
countenances
in
the
hectic
flame
of
their
eyes
which
when
they
met
a
soldier
blazed
with
hatred
in
vain
the
soldiers
scoured
the
streets
in
search
of
food
biting
their
lips
in
anger
a
single
lunchroom
was
open
at
once
they
filled
it
no
beans
no
tortillas
only
chili
and
tomato
sauce
in
vain
the
officers
showed
their
pocketbooks
stuffed
with
bills
or
used
threats
yea
you
got
papers
all
right
that
all
you
brought
try
and
eat
them
will
you
said
the
owner
an
insolent
old
shrew
with
an
enormous
scar
on
her
cheek
who
told
them
she
had
already
lain
with
a
dead
man
to
cure
her
from
ever
feeling
frightened
again
despite
the
melancholy
and
desolation
of
the
town
while
the
women
sang
in
the
church
birds
sang
in
the
foliage
and
the
thrushes
piped
their
lyrical
strain
on
the
withered
branches
of
the
orange
trees
vi
demetrio
macias
wife
mad
with
joy
rushed
along
the
trail
to
meet
him
leading
a
child
by
the
hand
an
absence
of
almost
two
years
they
embraced
each
other
and
stood
speechless
she
wept
sobbed
demetrio
stared
in
astonishment
at
his
wife
who
seemed
to
have
aged
ten
or
twenty
years
then
he
looked
at
the
child
who
gazed
up
at
him
in
surprise
his
heart
leaped
to
his
mouth
as
he
saw
in
the
features
his
own
steel
features
and
fiery
eyes
exactly
reproduced
he
wanted
to
hold
him
in
his
arms
but
the
frightened
child
took
refuge
in
his
mother
skirts
it
your
own
father
baby
it
your
daddy
the
child
hid
his
face
within
the
folds
of
his
mother
skirt
still
hostile
demetrio
handed
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
his
orderly
and
walked
slowly
along
the
steep
trail
with
his
wife
and
son
blessed
be
the
virgin
mary
praise
be
to
god
now
you
never
leave
us
any
more
will
you
never
never
you
stay
with
us
always
demetrio
face
grew
dark
both
remained
silent
lost
in
anguish
demetrio
suppressed
a
sigh
memories
crowded
and
buzzed
through
his
brain
like
bees
about
a
hive
a
black
cloud
rose
behind
the
sierra
and
a
deafening
roar
of
thunder
resounded
the
rain
began
to
fall
in
heavy
drops
they
sought
refuge
in
a
rocky
hut
the
rain
came
pelting
down
shattering
the
white
saint
john
roses
clustered
like
sheaves
of
stars
clinging
to
tree
rock
bush
and
pitaya
over
the
entire
mountainside
below
in
the
depths
of
the
canyon
through
the
gauze
of
the
rain
they
could
see
the
tall
sheer
palms
shaking
in
the
wind
opening
out
like
fans
before
the
tempest
everywhere
mountains
heaving
hills
and
beyond
more
hills
locked
amid
mountains
more
mountains
encircled
in
the
wall
of
the
sierra
whose
loftiest
peaks
vanished
in
the
sapphire
of
the
sky
demetrio
please
for
god
sake
do
go
away
my
heart
tells
me
something
will
happen
to
you
this
time
again
she
was
wracked
with
sobs
the
child
frightened
cried
and
screamed
to
calm
him
she
controlled
her
own
great
grief
gradually
the
rain
stopped
a
swallow
with
silver
breast
and
wings
describing
luminous
charming
curves
fluttered
obliquely
across
the
silver
threads
of
the
rain
gleaming
suddenly
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
why
do
you
keep
on
fighting
demetrio
demetrio
frowned
deeply
picking
up
a
stone
he
threw
it
to
the
bottom
of
the
canyon
then
he
stared
pensively
into
the
abyss
watching
the
arch
of
its
flight
look
at
that
stone
how
it
keeps
on
going
vii
it
was
a
heavenly
morning
it
had
rained
all
night
the
sky
awakened
covered
with
white
clouds
young
wild
colts
trotted
on
the
summit
of
the
sierra
with
tense
manes
and
waving
hair
proud
as
the
peaks
lifting
their
heads
to
the
clouds
the
soldiers
stepped
among
the
huge
rocks
buoyed
up
by
the
happiness
of
the
morning
none
for
a
moment
dreamed
of
the
treacherous
bullet
that
might
be
awaiting
him
ahead
the
unforeseen
provides
man
with
his
greatest
joy
the
soldiers
sang
laughed
and
chattered
away
the
spirit
of
nomadic
tribes
stirred
their
souls
what
matters
it
whether
you
go
and
whence
you
come
all
that
matters
is
to
walk
to
walk
endlessly
without
ever
stopping
to
possess
the
valley
the
heights
of
the
sierra
far
as
the
eye
can
read
trees
brush
and
cactus
shone
fresh
after
rain
heavy
drops
of
limpid
water
fell
from
rocks
ocher
in
hue
as
rusty
armor
demetrio
macias
men
grew
silent
for
a
moment
they
believed
they
heard
the
familiar
rumor
of
firing
in
the
distance
a
few
minutes
elapsed
but
the
sound
was
not
repeated
in
this
same
sierra
demetrio
said
with
but
twenty
men
i
killed
five
hundred
federals
remember
anastasio
as
demetrio
began
to
tell
that
famous
exploit
the
men
realized
the
danger
they
were
facing
what
if
the
enemy
instead
of
being
two
days
away
was
hiding
somewhere
among
the
underbrush
on
the
terrible
hill
through
whose
gorge
they
now
advanced
none
dared
show
the
slightest
fear
not
one
of
demetrio
macias
men
dared
say
i
shall
not
move
another
inch
so
when
firing
began
in
the
distance
where
the
vanguard
was
marching
no
one
felt
surprised
the
recruits
turned
back
hurriedly
retreating
in
shameful
flight
searching
for
a
way
out
of
the
canyon
a
curse
broke
from
demetrio
parched
lips
fire
at
shoot
any
man
who
runs
away
storm
the
hill
he
thundered
like
a
wild
beast
but
the
enemy
lying
in
ambush
by
the
thousand
opened
up
its
fire
demetrio
men
fell
like
wheat
under
the
sickle
tears
of
rage
and
pain
rise
to
demetrio
eyes
as
anastasio
slowly
slides
from
his
horse
without
a
sound
and
lies
outstretched
motionless
venancio
falls
close
beside
him
his
chest
riddled
with
bullets
meco
hurtles
over
the
precipice
bounding
from
rock
to
rock
suddenly
demetrio
finds
himself
alone
bullets
whiz
past
his
ears
like
hail
he
dismounts
and
crawls
over
the
rocks
until
he
finds
a
parapet
he
lays
down
a
stone
to
protect
his
head
and
lying
flat
on
the
ground
begins
to
shoot
the
enemy
scatter
in
all
directions
pursuing
the
few
fugitives
hiding
in
the
brush
demetrio
aims
he
does
not
waste
a
single
shot
his
famous
marksmanship
fills
him
with
joy
where
he
settles
his
glance
he
settles
a
bullet
he
loads
his
gun
once
more
takes
aim
the
smoke
of
the
guns
hangs
thick
in
the
air
locusts
chant
their
mysterious
imperturbable
song
doves
coo
lyrically
in
the
crannies
of
the
rocks
the
cows
graze
placidly
the
sierra
is
clad
in
gala
colors
over
its
inaccessible
peaks
the
opalescent
fog
settles
like
a
snowy
veil
on
the
forehead
of
a
bride
at
the
foot
of
a
hollow
sumptuous
and
huge
as
the
portico
of
an
old
cathedral
demetrio
macias
his
eyes
leveled
in
an
eternal
glance
continues
to
point
the
barrel
of
his
gun
