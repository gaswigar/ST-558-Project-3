the
man
from
the
asked
what
do
you
think
of
the
aliens
mister
nathen
are
they
friendly
do
they
look
human
very
human
said
the
thin
young
man
outside
rain
sleeted
across
the
big
windows
with
a
steady
faint
drumming
blurring
and
dimming
the
view
of
the
airfield
where
would
arrive
on
the
concrete
runways
the
puddles
were
pockmarked
with
rain
and
the
grass
growing
untouched
between
the
runways
of
the
unused
field
glistened
wetly
bending
before
gusts
of
wind
back
at
a
respectful
distance
from
where
the
huge
spaceship
would
land
were
the
gray
shapes
of
trucks
where
tv
camera
crews
huddled
inside
their
mobile
units
waiting
farther
back
in
the
deserted
sandy
landscape
behind
distant
sandy
hills
artillery
was
ringed
in
a
great
circle
and
in
the
distance
across
the
horizon
bombers
stood
ready
at
airfields
guarding
the
world
against
possible
treachery
from
the
first
alien
ship
ever
to
land
from
space
do
you
know
anything
about
their
home
planet
asked
the
man
from
the
man
stood
with
the
others
listening
absently
thinking
of
questions
but
reserving
them
joseph
nathen
the
thin
young
man
with
the
straight
black
hair
and
the
tired
lines
on
his
face
was
being
treated
with
respect
by
his
interviewers
he
was
obviously
on
edge
and
they
did
not
want
to
harry
him
with
too
many
questions
to
answer
at
once
they
wanted
to
keep
his
good
will
tomorrow
he
would
be
one
of
the
biggest
celebrities
ever
to
appear
in
headlines
no
nothing
directly
any
ideas
or
deductions
persisted
their
world
must
be
to
them
the
young
man
answered
uncertainly
the
environment
evolves
the
animal
but
only
in
relative
terms
of
course
he
looked
at
them
with
a
quick
glance
and
then
looked
away
evasively
his
lank
black
hair
beginning
to
cling
to
his
forehead
with
sweat
that
does
necessarily
mean
anything
muttered
a
reporter
writing
it
down
as
if
he
had
noticed
nothing
more
in
the
reply
the
man
glanced
at
the
wondering
if
he
had
noticed
and
received
a
quick
glance
in
exchange
the
asked
nathen
you
think
they
are
dangerous
then
it
was
the
kind
of
question
assuming
much
which
usually
broke
reticence
and
brought
forth
quick
facts
when
it
hit
the
mark
they
all
knew
of
the
military
precautions
although
they
were
not
supposed
to
know
the
question
missed
nathen
glanced
out
the
window
vaguely
no
i
would
say
so
you
think
they
are
friendly
then
said
the
equally
positive
on
the
opposite
tack
a
fleeting
smile
touched
nathen
lips
those
i
know
are
there
was
no
lead
in
this
direction
and
they
had
to
get
the
basic
facts
of
the
story
before
the
ship
came
the
asked
what
led
up
to
your
contacting
them
nathen
answered
after
a
hesitation
static
radio
static
the
army
told
you
my
job
did
they
the
army
had
told
them
nothing
at
all
the
officer
who
had
conducted
them
in
for
the
interview
stood
glowering
watchfully
as
if
he
objected
by
instinct
to
telling
anything
to
the
public
nathen
glanced
at
him
doubtfully
my
job
is
radio
decoder
for
the
department
of
military
intelligence
i
use
a
directional
pickup
tune
in
on
foreign
bands
record
any
scrambled
or
coded
messages
i
hear
and
build
automatic
decoders
and
descramblers
for
all
the
basic
scramble
patterns
the
officer
cleared
his
throat
but
said
nothing
the
reporters
smiled
noting
that
down
security
regulations
had
changed
since
arms
inspection
had
been
legalized
by
the
complete
information
being
the
only
public
security
against
secret
rearmament
spying
and
prying
had
come
to
seem
a
public
service
its
aura
had
changed
it
was
good
public
relations
to
admit
to
it
nathen
continued
i
started
directing
the
pickup
at
stars
in
my
spare
time
there
radio
noise
from
stars
you
know
just
stuff
that
sounds
like
spatter
static
and
an
occasional
squawk
people
have
been
listening
to
it
for
a
long
time
and
researching
trying
to
work
out
why
stellar
radiation
on
those
bands
comes
in
such
jagged
bursts
it
did
seem
natural
he
paused
and
smiled
uncertainly
aware
that
the
next
thing
he
would
say
was
the
thing
that
would
make
him
famous
an
idea
that
had
come
to
him
while
he
listened
an
idea
as
simple
and
as
perfect
as
the
one
that
came
to
newton
when
he
saw
the
apple
fall
i
decided
it
was
natural
i
tried
decoding
it
hurriedly
he
tried
to
explain
it
away
and
make
it
seem
obvious
you
see
there
an
old
intelligence
trick
speeding
up
a
message
on
a
record
until
it
sounds
just
like
that
a
short
squawk
of
static
and
then
broadcasting
it
undergrounds
use
it
i
heard
that
kind
of
screech
before
you
mean
they
broadcast
at
us
in
code
asked
the
it
not
exactly
code
all
you
need
to
do
is
record
it
and
slow
it
down
they
not
broadcasting
at
us
if
a
star
has
planets
inhabited
planets
and
there
is
broadcasting
between
them
they
would
send
it
on
a
tight
beam
to
save
power
he
looked
for
comprehension
you
know
like
a
spotlight
theoretically
a
tight
beam
can
go
on
forever
without
losing
power
but
aiming
would
be
difficult
from
planet
to
planet
you
ca
expect
a
beam
to
stay
on
target
over
such
distances
more
than
a
few
seconds
at
a
time
so
they
naturally
compress
each
message
into
a
short
or
package
and
send
it
a
few
hundred
times
in
one
long
blast
to
make
sure
it
is
picked
up
during
the
instant
the
beam
swings
across
the
target
he
was
talking
slowly
and
carefully
remembering
that
this
explanation
was
for
the
newspapers
when
a
stray
beam
swings
through
our
section
of
space
there
a
sharp
peak
in
noise
level
from
that
direction
the
beams
are
swinging
to
follow
their
own
planets
at
home
and
the
distance
between
there
and
here
exaggerates
the
speed
of
swing
tremendously
so
we
would
pick
up
more
than
a
bip
as
it
passes
how
do
you
account
for
the
number
of
squawks
coming
in
the
asked
do
stellar
systems
rotate
on
the
plane
of
the
galaxy
it
was
a
private
question
he
spoke
impulsively
from
interest
and
excitement
the
radio
decoder
grinned
the
lines
of
strain
vanishing
from
his
face
for
a
moment
maybe
we
intercepting
everybody
telephone
calls
and
the
whole
galaxy
is
swarming
with
races
that
spend
all
day
yacking
at
each
other
over
the
radio
maybe
the
human
type
is
standard
model
it
would
take
something
like
that
the
agreed
they
smiled
at
each
other
the
asked
how
did
you
happen
to
pick
up
television
instead
of
voices
not
by
accident
nathen
explained
patiently
i
recognized
a
scanning
pattern
and
i
wanted
pictures
pictures
are
understandable
in
any
language
near
the
interviewers
a
senator
paced
back
and
forth
muttering
his
memorized
speech
of
welcome
and
nervously
glancing
out
the
wide
streaming
windows
into
the
gray
sleeting
rain
opposite
the
windows
of
the
long
room
was
a
small
raised
platform
flanked
by
the
tall
shapes
of
tv
cameras
and
sound
pickups
on
booms
and
darkened
floodlights
arranged
and
ready
for
the
senator
to
make
his
speech
of
welcome
to
the
aliens
and
the
world
a
shabby
radio
sending
set
stood
beside
it
without
a
case
to
conceal
its
parts
two
cathode
television
tubes
flickering
nakedly
on
one
side
and
the
speaker
humming
on
the
other
a
vertical
panel
of
dials
and
knobs
jutted
up
before
them
and
a
small
sat
ready
on
the
table
before
the
panel
it
was
connected
to
a
boxlike
expensively
cased
piece
of
equipment
with
radio
lab
property
stenciled
on
it
i
recorded
a
couple
of
package
screeches
from
sagittarius
and
began
working
on
them
nathen
added
it
took
a
couple
of
months
to
find
the
synchronizing
signals
and
set
the
scanners
close
enough
to
the
right
time
to
even
get
a
pattern
when
i
showed
the
pattern
to
the
department
they
gave
me
full
time
to
work
on
it
and
an
assistant
to
help
it
took
eight
months
to
pick
out
the
color
bands
and
assign
them
the
right
colors
to
get
anything
intelligible
on
the
screen
the
mess
of
exposed
parts
was
the
original
receiver
that
they
had
labored
over
for
ten
months
adjusting
and
readjusting
to
reduce
the
maddening
rippling
plaids
of
unsynchronized
color
scanners
to
some
kind
of
sane
picture
trial
and
error
said
nathen
but
it
came
out
all
right
the
wide
of
the
squawks
had
suggested
color
tv
from
the
beginning
he
walked
over
and
touched
the
set
the
speaker
bipped
slightly
and
the
gray
screen
flickered
with
a
flash
of
color
at
the
touch
the
set
was
awake
and
sensitive
tuned
to
receive
from
the
great
interstellar
spaceship
which
now
circled
the
atmosphere
we
wondered
why
there
were
so
many
bands
but
when
we
got
the
set
working
and
started
recording
and
playing
everything
that
came
in
we
found
we
tapped
something
like
a
lending
library
line
it
was
all
fiction
plays
between
the
pauses
in
nathen
voice
the
found
himself
unconsciously
listening
for
the
sound
of
roaring
swiftly
approaching
rocket
jets
the
asked
how
did
you
contact
the
spaceship
i
scanned
and
recorded
a
film
copy
of
of
the
combination
and
sent
it
back
along
the
same
line
we
were
receiving
from
just
testing
it
would
get
there
for
a
good
number
of
years
if
it
got
there
at
all
but
i
thought
it
would
please
the
library
to
get
a
new
record
in
two
weeks
later
when
we
caught
and
slowed
a
new
batch
of
recordings
we
found
an
answer
it
was
obviously
meant
for
us
it
was
a
flash
of
the
disney
being
played
to
a
large
audience
and
then
the
audience
sitting
and
waiting
before
a
blank
screen
the
signal
was
very
clear
and
loud
we
intercepted
a
spaceship
they
were
asking
for
an
encore
you
see
they
liked
the
film
and
wanted
more
he
smiled
at
them
in
sudden
thought
you
can
see
them
for
yourself
it
all
right
down
the
hall
where
the
linguists
are
working
on
the
automatic
translator
the
listening
officer
frowned
and
cleared
his
throat
and
the
thin
young
man
turned
to
him
quickly
no
security
reason
why
they
should
not
see
the
broadcasts
is
there
perhaps
you
should
show
them
he
said
to
the
reporters
reassuringly
it
right
down
the
hall
you
will
be
informed
the
moment
the
spaceship
approaches
the
interview
was
very
definitely
over
the
nervous
young
man
turned
away
and
seated
himself
at
the
radio
set
while
the
officer
swallowed
his
objections
and
showed
them
dourly
down
the
hall
to
a
closed
door
they
opened
it
and
fumbled
into
a
darkened
room
crowded
with
empty
folding
chairs
dominated
by
a
glowing
bright
screen
the
door
closed
behind
them
bringing
total
darkness
there
was
the
sound
of
reporters
fumbling
their
way
into
seats
around
him
but
the
man
remained
standing
aware
of
an
enormous
surprise
as
if
he
had
been
asleep
and
wakened
to
find
himself
in
the
wrong
country
the
bright
colors
of
the
double
image
seemed
the
only
real
thing
in
the
darkened
room
even
blurred
as
they
were
he
could
see
that
the
action
was
subtly
different
the
shapes
subtly
not
right
was
looking
at
the
impression
was
of
two
humans
disguised
humans
moving
oddly
carefully
afraid
the
images
would
go
away
he
reached
up
to
his
breast
pocket
took
out
his
polarized
glasses
rotated
one
lens
at
right
angles
to
the
other
and
put
them
on
immediately
the
two
beings
came
into
sharp
focus
real
and
solid
and
the
screen
became
a
wide
illusively
near
window
through
which
he
watched
them
they
were
conversing
with
each
other
in
a
room
discussing
something
with
restrained
excitement
the
large
man
in
the
green
tunic
closed
his
purple
eyes
for
an
instant
at
something
the
other
said
and
grimaced
making
a
motion
with
his
fingers
as
if
shoving
something
away
from
him
mellerdrammer
the
second
smaller
with
eyes
stepped
closer
talking
more
rapidly
in
a
lower
voice
the
first
stood
very
still
not
trying
to
interrupt
obviously
the
proposal
was
some
advantageous
treachery
and
he
wanted
to
be
persuaded
the
groped
for
a
chair
and
sat
down
perhaps
gesture
is
universal
desire
and
aversion
a
leaning
forward
or
a
leaning
back
tension
relaxation
perhaps
these
actors
were
masters
the
scenes
changed
a
corridor
a
parklike
place
in
what
he
began
to
realize
was
a
spaceship
a
lecture
room
there
were
others
talking
and
working
speaking
to
the
man
in
the
green
tunic
and
never
was
it
unclear
what
was
happening
or
how
they
felt
they
talked
a
flowing
language
with
many
short
vowels
and
shifts
of
pitch
and
they
gestured
in
the
heat
of
talk
their
hands
moving
with
an
odd
lagging
difference
of
motion
not
slow
but
somehow
drifting
he
ignored
the
language
but
after
a
time
the
difference
in
motion
began
to
arouse
his
interest
something
in
the
way
they
walked
with
an
effort
he
pulled
his
mind
from
the
plot
and
forced
his
attention
to
the
physical
difference
brown
hair
in
short
silky
crew
cuts
varied
eye
colors
the
colors
showing
clearly
because
their
irises
were
very
large
their
round
eyes
set
very
widely
apart
in
tapering
faces
their
necks
and
shoulders
were
thick
in
a
way
that
would
indicate
unusual
strength
for
a
human
but
their
wrists
were
narrow
and
their
fingers
long
and
thin
and
delicate
there
seemed
to
be
more
than
the
usual
number
of
fingers
since
he
came
in
a
machine
had
been
whirring
and
a
voice
muttering
beside
him
he
called
his
attention
from
counting
their
fingers
and
looked
around
beside
him
sat
an
man
wearing
earphones
watching
and
listening
with
hawklike
concentration
beside
him
was
a
tall
streamlined
box
from
the
screen
came
the
sound
of
the
alien
language
the
man
abruptly
flipped
a
switch
on
the
box
muttered
a
word
into
a
small
and
flipped
the
switch
back
with
nervous
rapidity
he
reminded
the
man
of
the
earphoned
interpreters
at
the
un
the
machine
was
probably
a
vocal
translator
and
the
mutterer
a
linguist
adding
to
its
vocabulary
near
the
screen
were
two
other
linguists
taking
notes
the
remembered
the
senator
pacing
in
the
observatory
room
rehearsing
his
speech
of
welcome
the
speech
would
not
be
just
the
empty
pompous
gesture
he
had
expected
it
would
be
translated
mechanically
and
understood
by
the
aliens
on
the
other
side
of
the
glowing
window
that
was
the
stereo
screen
the
large
protagonist
in
the
green
tunic
was
speaking
to
a
pilot
in
a
gray
uniform
they
stood
in
a
brightly
lit
control
room
in
a
spaceship
the
tried
to
pick
up
the
thread
of
the
plot
already
he
was
interested
in
the
fate
of
the
hero
and
liked
him
that
was
the
effect
of
good
acting
probably
for
part
of
the
art
of
acting
is
to
win
affection
from
the
audience
and
this
actor
might
be
the
matinee
idol
of
whole
solar
systems
controlled
tension
betraying
itself
by
a
jerk
of
the
hands
a
answer
to
a
question
the
uniformed
one
not
suspicious
turned
his
back
busying
himself
at
some
task
involving
a
map
lit
with
glowing
red
points
his
motions
sharing
the
same
fluid
dragging
grace
of
the
others
as
if
they
were
underwater
or
on
a
slow
motion
film
the
other
was
watching
a
switch
a
switch
set
into
a
panel
moving
closer
to
it
talking
casually
background
music
coming
and
rising
in
thin
chords
of
tension
there
was
a
closeup
of
the
alien
face
watching
the
switch
and
the
noted
that
his
ears
were
symmetrically
almost
perfect
with
no
earholes
visible
the
voice
of
the
uniformed
one
answered
a
brief
word
in
a
preoccupied
deep
voice
his
back
was
still
turned
the
other
glanced
at
the
switch
moving
closer
to
it
talking
casually
the
switch
coming
closer
and
closer
stereoscopically
it
was
in
reach
filling
the
screen
his
hand
came
into
view
darting
out
closed
over
the
switch
there
was
a
sharp
clap
of
sound
and
his
hand
opened
in
a
frozen
shape
of
pain
beyond
him
as
his
gaze
swung
up
stood
the
figure
of
the
uniformed
officer
unmoving
a
weapon
rigid
in
his
hand
in
the
startled
position
in
which
he
had
turned
and
fired
watching
with
widening
eyes
as
the
man
in
the
green
tunic
swayed
and
fell
the
tableau
held
the
uniformed
one
drooping
looking
down
at
his
hand
holding
the
weapon
which
had
killed
and
music
began
to
build
in
from
the
background
just
for
an
instant
the
room
and
the
things
within
it
flashed
into
one
of
those
bewildering
color
changes
which
were
the
bane
of
color
television
and
switched
to
a
color
negative
of
itself
a
green
man
standing
in
a
violet
control
room
looking
down
at
the
body
of
a
green
man
in
a
red
tunic
it
held
for
less
than
a
second
then
the
color
band
alternator
fell
back
into
phase
and
the
colors
reversed
to
normal
another
uniformed
man
came
and
took
the
weapon
from
the
limp
hand
of
the
other
who
began
to
explain
dejectedly
in
a
low
voice
while
the
music
mounted
and
covered
his
words
and
the
screen
slowly
went
blank
like
a
window
that
slowly
filmed
over
with
gray
fog
the
music
faded
in
the
dark
someone
clapped
appreciatively
the
earphoned
man
beside
the
shifted
his
earphones
back
from
his
ears
and
spoke
briskly
i
ca
get
any
more
either
of
you
want
a
replay
there
was
a
short
silence
until
the
linguist
nearest
the
set
said
i
guess
we
squeezed
that
one
dry
let
run
the
tape
where
nathen
and
that
ship
radio
boy
are
kidding
around
cqing
and
tuning
their
beams
in
closer
i
have
a
hunch
the
boy
is
talking
routine
ham
talk
and
giving
the
old
radio
count
there
was
some
fumbling
in
the
and
then
the
screen
came
to
life
again
it
showed
a
flash
of
an
audience
sitting
before
a
screen
and
gave
a
clipped
chord
of
some
familiar
symphony
crazy
about
stravinsky
and
mozart
remarked
the
earphoned
linguist
to
the
resettling
his
earphones
ca
stand
gershwin
can
you
beat
that
he
turned
his
attention
back
to
the
screen
as
the
right
sequence
came
on
the
who
was
sitting
just
in
front
of
him
turned
to
the
and
said
funny
how
much
they
look
like
people
he
was
writing
making
notes
to
telephone
his
report
what
color
hair
did
that
character
have
i
did
notice
he
wondered
if
he
should
remind
the
reporter
that
nathen
had
said
he
assigned
the
color
bands
on
guess
choosing
the
colors
that
gave
the
most
plausible
images
the
guests
when
they
arrived
could
turn
out
to
be
bright
green
with
blue
hair
only
the
gradations
of
color
in
the
picture
were
sure
only
the
similarities
and
contrasts
the
relationship
of
one
color
to
another
from
the
screen
came
the
sound
of
the
alien
language
again
this
race
averaged
deeper
voices
than
human
he
liked
deep
voices
could
he
write
that
no
there
was
something
wrong
with
that
too
how
had
nathen
established
the
right
pitch
was
it
a
matter
of
taking
the
modulation
as
it
came
in
or
some
sort
of
hetrodyning
up
and
down
by
trial
and
error
probably
it
might
be
safer
to
assume
that
nathen
had
simply
preferred
deep
voices
as
he
sat
there
doubting
an
uneasiness
he
had
seen
in
nathen
came
back
to
add
to
his
own
uncertainty
and
he
remembered
just
how
close
that
uneasiness
had
come
to
something
that
looked
like
restrained
fear
what
i
do
get
is
why
he
went
to
all
the
trouble
of
picking
up
tv
shows
instead
of
just
contacting
them
the
complained
good
shows
but
what
the
point
maybe
so
we
get
to
learn
their
language
too
said
the
on
the
screen
now
was
the
obviously
unstaged
and
genuine
scene
of
a
young
alien
working
over
a
bank
of
apparatus
he
turned
and
waved
and
opened
his
mouth
in
the
comical
o
shape
which
the
was
beginning
to
recognize
as
their
equivalent
of
a
smile
then
went
back
to
trying
to
explain
something
about
the
equipment
in
elaborate
awkward
gestures
and
carefully
mouthed
words
the
got
up
quietly
went
out
into
the
bright
white
stone
corridor
and
walked
back
the
way
he
had
come
thoughtfully
folding
his
stereo
glasses
and
putting
them
away
no
one
stopped
him
secrecy
restrictions
were
ambiguous
here
the
reticence
of
the
army
seemed
more
a
matter
of
habit
mere
reflex
from
the
fact
that
it
had
all
originated
in
the
intelligence
department
than
any
reasoned
policy
of
keeping
the
landing
a
secret
the
main
room
was
more
crowded
than
he
had
left
it
the
tv
camera
and
sound
crew
stood
near
their
apparatus
the
senator
had
found
a
chair
and
was
reading
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
eight
men
were
grouped
in
a
circle
of
chairs
arguing
something
with
impassioned
concentration
the
recognized
a
few
he
knew
personally
eminent
names
in
science
workers
in
field
theory
a
stray
phrase
reached
him
reference
to
the
universal
constants
as
ratio
it
was
probably
a
discussion
of
ways
of
converting
formulas
from
one
mathematics
to
another
for
a
rapid
exchange
of
information
they
had
reason
to
be
intent
aware
of
the
flood
of
insights
that
novel
viewpoints
could
bring
if
they
could
grasp
them
he
would
have
liked
to
go
over
and
listen
but
there
was
too
little
time
left
before
the
spaceship
was
due
and
he
had
a
question
to
ask
the
transceiver
was
still
humming
tuned
to
the
sending
band
of
the
circling
ship
and
the
young
man
who
had
started
it
all
was
sitting
on
the
edge
of
the
tv
platform
with
his
chin
resting
in
one
hand
he
did
not
look
up
as
the
approached
but
it
was
the
indifference
of
preoccupation
not
discourtesy
the
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
platform
beside
him
and
took
out
a
pack
of
cigarettes
then
remembered
the
coming
tv
broadcast
and
the
ban
on
smoking
he
put
them
away
thoughtfully
watching
the
diminishing
rain
spray
against
the
streaming
windows
what
wrong
he
asked
nathen
showed
that
he
was
aware
and
friendly
by
a
slight
motion
of
his
head
tell
me
hunch
said
the
man
sheer
hunch
everything
sailing
along
too
smoothly
everyone
taking
too
much
for
granted
nathen
relaxed
slightly
i
still
listening
something
about
the
way
they
move
nathen
shifted
to
glance
at
him
that
bothered
me
too
are
you
sure
they
adjusted
to
the
right
speed
nathen
clenched
his
hands
out
in
front
of
him
and
looked
at
them
consideringly
i
do
know
when
i
turn
the
tape
faster
they
all
rushing
and
you
begin
to
wonder
why
their
clothes
do
stream
behind
them
why
the
doors
close
so
quickly
and
yet
you
ca
hear
them
slam
why
things
fall
so
fast
if
i
turn
it
slower
they
all
seem
to
be
swimming
he
gave
the
a
considering
sidewise
glance
catch
the
name
guy
thought
the
jacob
luke
he
said
extending
his
hand
nathen
gave
the
hand
a
quick
hard
grip
identifying
the
name
sunday
science
section
editor
i
read
it
surprised
to
meet
you
here
likewise
the
smiled
look
have
you
gone
into
this
rationally
with
formulas
he
found
a
pencil
in
his
pocket
obviously
there
something
wrong
with
our
judgment
of
their
ratio
maybe
it
something
simple
like
low
gravity
aboard
ship
with
magnetic
shoes
maybe
they
floating
slightly
why
worry
nathen
cut
in
i
do
see
any
reason
to
try
to
figure
it
out
now
he
laughed
and
shoved
back
his
black
hair
nervously
see
them
in
twenty
minutes
will
we
asked
the
slowly
there
was
a
silence
while
the
senator
turned
a
page
of
his
magazine
with
a
slight
crackling
of
paper
and
the
scientists
argued
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
nathen
pushed
at
his
lank
black
hair
again
as
if
it
were
trying
to
fall
forward
in
front
of
his
eyes
and
keep
him
from
seeing
sure
the
young
man
laughed
suddenly
talked
rapidly
sure
see
them
why
should
we
with
all
the
government
ready
with
welcome
speeches
the
whole
army
turned
out
and
hiding
over
the
hill
reporters
all
around
newsreel
cameras
everything
set
up
to
broadcast
the
landing
to
the
world
the
president
himself
shaking
hands
with
me
and
waiting
in
washington
he
came
to
the
truth
without
pausing
for
breath
he
said
hell
no
they
wo
get
here
there
some
mistake
somewhere
something
wrong
i
should
have
told
the
brasshats
yesterday
when
i
started
adding
it
up
do
know
why
i
did
say
anything
scared
i
guess
too
much
top
rank
around
here
lost
my
nerve
he
clutched
the
man
sleeve
look
i
do
know
what
a
green
light
flashed
on
the
set
nathen
did
look
at
it
but
he
stopped
talking
the
loudspeaker
on
the
set
broke
into
a
voice
speaking
in
the
language
the
senator
started
and
looked
nervously
at
it
straightening
his
tie
the
voice
stopped
nathen
turned
and
looked
at
the
loudspeaker
his
worry
seemed
to
be
gone
what
is
it
the
asked
anxiously
he
says
they
slowed
enough
to
enter
the
atmosphere
now
they
be
here
in
five
to
ten
minutes
i
guess
that
bud
he
all
excited
he
says
holy
smoke
what
a
planet
we
live
on
nathen
smiled
kidding
the
was
puzzled
what
does
he
mean
murky
it
ca
be
raining
over
much
territory
on
earth
outside
the
rain
was
slowing
and
bright
blue
patches
of
sky
were
shining
through
breaks
in
the
cloud
blanket
glittering
blue
light
from
the
drops
that
ran
down
the
windows
he
tried
to
think
of
an
explanation
maybe
they
trying
to
land
on
venus
the
thought
was
ridiculous
he
knew
the
spaceship
was
following
nathen
sending
beam
it
could
miss
earth
bud
had
to
be
kidding
the
green
light
glowed
on
the
set
again
and
they
stopped
speaking
waiting
for
the
message
to
be
recorded
slowed
and
replayed
the
cathode
screen
came
to
life
suddenly
with
a
picture
of
the
young
man
sitting
at
his
his
back
turned
watching
a
screen
at
one
side
which
showed
a
glimpse
of
a
huge
dark
plain
approaching
as
the
ship
plunged
down
toward
it
the
illusion
of
solidity
melted
into
a
boiling
turbulence
of
black
clouds
they
expanded
in
an
inky
swirl
looked
huge
for
an
instant
and
then
blackness
swallowed
the
screen
the
young
alien
swung
around
to
face
the
camera
speaking
a
few
words
as
he
moved
made
the
o
of
a
smile
again
then
flipped
the
switch
and
the
screen
went
gray
nathen
voice
was
suddenly
toneless
and
strained
he
said
something
like
break
out
the
drinks
here
they
come
the
atmosphere
does
look
like
that
the
said
at
random
knowing
he
was
saying
something
too
obvious
even
to
think
about
not
earth
atmosphere
some
people
drifted
up
what
did
they
say
entering
the
atmosphere
ought
to
be
landing
in
five
or
ten
minutes
nathen
told
them
a
ripple
of
heightened
excitement
ran
through
the
room
cameramen
began
adjusting
the
lens
angles
again
turning
on
the
mike
and
checking
it
turning
on
the
floodlights
the
scientists
rose
and
stood
near
the
window
still
talking
the
reporters
trooped
in
from
the
hall
and
went
to
the
windows
to
watch
for
the
great
event
the
three
linguists
came
in
trundling
a
large
wheeled
box
that
was
the
mechanical
translator
supervising
while
it
was
hitched
into
the
sound
broadcasting
system
landing
where
the
asked
nathen
brutally
why
do
you
do
something
tell
me
what
to
do
and
i
do
it
nathen
said
quietly
not
moving
it
was
not
sarcasm
jacob
luke
of
the
looked
sidewise
at
the
strained
whiteness
of
his
face
and
moderated
his
tone
ca
you
contact
them
not
while
they
landing
what
now
the
took
out
a
pack
of
cigarettes
remembered
the
rule
against
smoking
and
put
it
back
we
just
wait
nathen
leaned
his
elbow
on
one
knee
and
his
chin
in
his
hand
they
waited
all
the
people
in
the
room
were
waiting
there
was
no
more
conversation
a
bald
man
of
the
scientist
group
was
automatically
buffing
his
fingernails
over
and
over
and
inspecting
them
without
seeing
them
another
absently
polished
his
glasses
held
them
up
to
the
light
put
them
on
and
then
a
moment
later
took
them
off
and
began
polishing
again
the
television
crew
concentrated
on
their
jobs
moving
quietly
and
efficiently
with
perfectionist
care
minutely
arranging
things
which
did
not
need
to
be
arranged
checking
things
that
had
already
been
checked
this
was
to
be
one
of
the
great
moments
of
human
history
and
they
were
all
trying
to
forget
that
fact
and
remain
impassive
and
wrapped
up
in
the
problems
of
their
jobs
as
good
specialists
should
after
an
interminable
age
the
consulted
his
watch
three
minutes
had
passed
he
tried
holding
his
breath
a
moment
listening
for
a
distant
approaching
thunder
of
jets
there
was
no
sound
the
sun
came
out
from
behind
the
clouds
and
lit
up
the
field
like
a
great
spotlight
on
an
empty
stage
abruptly
the
green
light
shone
on
the
set
again
indicating
that
a
squawk
message
had
been
received
the
recorder
recorded
it
slowed
it
and
fed
it
back
to
the
speaker
it
clicked
and
the
sound
was
very
loud
in
the
still
tense
room
the
screen
remained
gray
but
bud
voice
spoke
a
few
words
in
the
alien
language
he
stopped
the
speaker
clicked
and
the
light
went
out
when
it
was
plain
that
nothing
more
would
occur
and
no
announcement
was
to
be
made
of
what
was
said
the
people
in
the
room
turned
back
to
the
windows
talk
picked
up
again
somebody
told
a
joke
and
laughed
alone
one
of
the
linguists
remained
turned
toward
the
loudspeaker
then
looked
at
the
widening
patches
of
blue
sky
showing
out
the
window
his
expression
puzzled
he
had
understood
it
dark
the
thin
intelligence
department
decoder
translated
to
the
man
from
the
your
atmosphere
is
that
precisely
what
bud
said
another
three
minutes
the
caught
himself
about
to
light
a
cigarette
and
swore
silently
blowing
the
match
out
and
putting
the
cigarette
back
into
its
package
he
listened
for
the
sound
of
the
rocket
jets
it
was
time
for
the
landing
yet
he
heard
no
blasts
the
green
light
came
on
in
the
transceiver
message
in
instinctively
he
came
to
his
feet
nathen
abruptly
was
standing
beside
him
then
the
message
came
in
the
voice
he
was
coming
to
think
of
as
bud
it
spoke
and
paused
suddenly
the
knew
we
landed
nathen
whispered
the
words
the
wind
blew
across
the
open
spaces
of
white
concrete
and
damp
soil
that
was
the
empty
airfield
swaying
the
wet
shiny
grass
the
people
in
the
room
looked
out
listening
for
the
roar
of
jets
looking
for
the
silver
bulk
of
a
spaceship
in
the
sky
nathen
moved
seating
himself
at
the
transmitter
switching
it
on
to
warm
up
checking
and
balancing
dials
jacob
luke
of
the
moved
softly
to
stand
behind
his
right
shoulder
hoping
he
could
be
useful
nathen
made
a
half
motion
of
his
head
as
if
to
glance
back
at
him
unhooked
two
of
the
earphone
sets
hanging
on
the
side
of
the
tall
streamlined
box
that
was
the
automatic
translator
plugged
them
in
and
handed
one
back
over
his
shoulder
to
the
man
the
voice
began
to
come
from
the
speaker
again
hastily
jacob
luke
fitted
the
earphones
over
his
ears
he
fancied
he
could
hear
bud
voice
tremble
for
a
moment
it
was
just
bud
voice
speaking
the
alien
language
and
then
very
distant
and
clear
in
his
earphones
he
heard
the
recorded
voice
of
the
linguist
say
an
english
word
then
a
mechanical
click
and
another
clear
word
in
the
voice
of
one
of
the
other
translators
then
another
as
the
alien
voice
flowed
from
the
loudspeaker
the
cool
single
words
barely
audible
overlapping
and
blending
with
it
like
translating
thought
skipping
unfamiliar
words
yet
quite
astonishingly
clear
radar
shows
no
buildings
or
civilization
near
the
atmosphere
around
us
registers
as
thick
as
glue
tremendous
gas
pressure
low
gravity
no
light
at
all
you
did
describe
it
like
this
where
are
you
joe
this
is
some
kind
of
trick
is
it
bud
hesitated
was
prompted
by
a
deeper
official
voice
and
jerked
out
the
words
if
it
is
a
trick
we
are
ready
to
repel
attack
the
linguist
stood
listening
he
whitened
slowly
and
beckoned
the
other
linguists
over
to
him
and
whispered
to
them
joseph
nathen
looked
at
them
with
unwarranted
bitter
hostility
while
he
picked
up
the
plugging
it
into
the
translator
joe
calling
he
said
quietly
into
it
in
clear
slow
english
no
trick
we
do
know
where
you
are
i
am
trying
to
get
a
direction
fix
from
your
signal
describe
your
surroundings
to
us
if
at
all
possible
nearby
the
floodlights
blazed
steadily
on
the
television
platform
ready
for
the
official
welcome
of
the
aliens
to
earth
the
television
channels
of
the
world
had
been
alerted
to
set
aside
their
scheduled
programs
for
an
unscheduled
great
event
in
the
long
room
the
people
waited
listening
for
the
swelling
sound
of
rocket
jets
this
time
after
the
light
came
on
there
was
a
long
delay
the
speaker
sputtered
and
sputtered
again
building
to
a
steady
scratching
they
could
barely
sense
as
a
dim
voice
it
came
through
in
a
few
tinny
words
and
then
wavered
back
to
inaudibility
the
machine
translated
in
their
earphones
tried
seemed
repair
suddenly
it
came
in
clearly
tell
if
the
auxiliary
blew
too
will
try
it
we
might
pick
you
up
clearly
on
the
next
try
i
have
the
volume
down
where
is
the
landing
port
repeat
where
is
the
landing
port
where
are
you
nathen
put
down
the
and
carefully
set
a
dial
on
the
recording
box
and
flipped
a
switch
speaking
over
his
shoulder
this
sets
it
to
repeat
what
i
said
the
last
time
it
keeps
repeating
then
he
sat
with
unnatural
stillness
his
head
still
half
turned
as
if
he
had
suddenly
caught
a
glimpse
of
answer
and
was
trying
with
no
success
whatever
to
grasp
it
the
green
warning
light
cut
in
the
recording
clicked
and
the
playback
of
bud
face
and
voice
appeared
on
the
screen
we
heard
a
few
words
joe
and
then
the
receiver
blew
again
adjusting
a
viewing
screen
to
pick
up
the
long
waves
that
go
through
the
murk
and
convert
them
to
visible
light
we
be
able
to
see
out
soon
the
engineer
says
that
something
is
wrong
with
the
stern
jets
and
the
captain
has
had
me
broadcast
a
help
call
to
our
nearest
space
base
he
made
the
mouth
o
of
a
grin
the
message
reach
it
for
some
years
i
trust
you
joe
but
get
us
out
of
here
will
you
they
buzzing
that
the
screen
is
finally
ready
hold
everything
the
screen
went
gray
and
the
green
light
went
off
the
considered
the
lag
required
for
the
help
call
the
speaking
and
recording
of
the
message
just
received
the
time
needed
to
reconvert
a
viewing
screen
they
work
fast
he
shifted
uneasily
and
added
at
random
something
wrong
with
the
time
factor
all
wrong
they
work
fast
the
green
light
came
on
again
immediately
nathen
half
turned
to
him
sliding
his
words
hastily
into
the
gap
of
time
as
the
message
was
recorded
and
slowed
they
close
enough
for
our
transmission
power
to
blow
their
receiver
if
it
was
on
earth
why
the
darkness
around
the
ship
maybe
they
see
in
the
high
the
atmosphere
is
opaque
to
that
band
the
suggested
hastily
as
the
speaker
began
to
talk
in
the
young
extraterrestrial
voice
it
shaking
now
stand
by
for
the
description
they
tensed
waiting
the
brought
a
map
of
the
state
before
his
mind
eye
a
half
circle
of
cliffs
around
the
horizon
a
wide
muddy
lake
swarming
with
swimming
things
huge
strange
white
foliage
all
around
the
ship
and
incredibly
huge
pulpy
monsters
attacking
and
eating
each
other
on
all
sides
we
almost
landed
in
the
lake
right
on
the
soft
edge
the
mud
ca
hold
the
ship
weight
and
we
sinking
the
engineer
says
we
might
be
able
to
blast
free
but
the
tubes
are
and
might
blow
up
the
ship
when
can
you
reach
us
the
thought
vaguely
of
the
carboniferous
era
nathen
obviously
had
seen
something
he
had
not
where
are
they
the
asked
him
quietly
nathen
pointed
to
the
antenna
position
indicators
the
let
his
eyes
follow
the
converging
imaginary
lines
of
focus
out
the
window
to
the
sunlit
airfield
the
empty
airfield
the
drying
concrete
and
green
waving
grass
where
the
lines
met
the
lines
met
the
spaceship
was
there
the
fear
of
something
unknown
gripped
him
suddenly
the
spaceship
was
broadcasting
again
are
you
answer
if
possible
we
are
sinking
where
are
you
he
saw
that
nathen
knew
what
is
it
the
asked
hoarsely
are
they
in
another
dimension
or
the
past
or
on
another
world
or
what
nathen
was
smiling
bitterly
and
jacob
luke
remembered
that
the
young
man
had
a
friend
in
that
spaceship
my
guess
is
that
they
evolved
on
a
planet
with
a
thin
atmosphere
near
a
star
sure
they
see
in
the
range
our
sun
is
abnormally
small
and
dim
and
yellow
our
atmosphere
is
so
thick
it
screens
out
he
laughed
harshly
a
good
joke
on
us
the
weird
place
we
evolved
in
the
thing
it
did
to
us
where
are
you
called
the
alien
spaceship
hurry
please
sinking
the
decoder
slowed
his
tumbled
frightened
words
and
looked
up
into
the
face
for
understanding
we
rescue
them
he
said
quietly
you
were
right
about
the
time
factor
right
about
them
moving
at
a
different
speed
i
misunderstood
this
business
about
squawk
coding
speeding
for
better
transmission
to
counteract
beam
waver
i
was
wrong
what
do
you
mean
they
do
speed
up
their
broadcasts
they
do
suddenly
in
his
mind
eye
the
began
to
see
again
the
play
he
had
just
seen
but
the
actors
were
moving
at
blurring
speed
the
words
jerking
out
in
a
fluting
dizzying
stream
thoughts
and
decisions
passing
with
unfollowable
rapidity
rippling
faces
in
a
twisting
blur
of
expressions
doors
slamming
wildly
shatteringly
as
the
actors
leaped
in
and
out
of
rooms
no
faster
faster
he
was
visualizing
it
as
rapidly
as
it
was
an
hour
of
talk
and
action
in
one
almost
instantaneous
squawk
a
narrow
peak
of
noise
interfering
with
a
single
word
in
an
earth
broadcast
faster
faster
it
was
impossible
matter
could
not
stand
such
stress
inertia
momentum
abrupt
weight
it
was
insane
why
he
asked
how
nathen
laughed
again
harshly
reaching
for
the
mike
get
them
out
there
is
a
lake
or
river
within
hundreds
of
miles
from
here
a
shiver
of
unreality
went
down
the
spine
automatically
and
inanely
he
found
himself
delving
in
his
pocket
for
a
cigarette
while
he
tried
to
grasp
what
had
happened
where
are
they
then
why
we
see
their
spaceship
nathen
switched
the
microphone
on
in
a
gesture
that
showed
the
bitterness
of
his
disappointment
we
need
a
magnifying
glass
for
that
