who

chapter
i
faced
with
reality
on
that
particular
november
evening
viner
a
young
gentleman
of
means
and
leisure
who
lived
in
a
comfortable
old
house
in
markendale
square
bayswater
in
company
with
his
maiden
aunt
miss
bethia
penkridge
had
spent
his
hours
in
a
fashion
which
had
become
a
habit
miss
penkridge
a
model
housekeeper
and
an
essentially
worthy
woman
whose
whole
day
was
given
to
supervising
somebody
or
something
had
an
insatiable
appetite
for
fiction
and
loved
nothing
so
much
as
that
her
nephew
should
read
a
novel
to
her
after
the
two
glasses
of
port
which
she
allowed
herself
every
night
had
been
thoughtfully
consumed
and
he
and
she
had
adjourned
from
the
to
the
hearthrug
in
the
library
her
tastes
however
in
viner
opinion
were
somewhat
if
not
decidedly
limited
brought
up
in
her
youth
on
miss
braddon
wilkie
collins
and
henry
wood
miss
penkridge
had
become
a
confirmed
slave
to
the
sensational
she
had
no
taste
for
the
psychological
and
nothing
but
scorn
for
the
erotic
what
she
loved
was
a
story
which
began
with
crime
and
ended
with
a
detection
a
story
which
kept
you
wondering
who
did
it
how
it
was
done
and
when
the
doing
was
going
to
be
laid
bare
to
the
light
of
day
nothing
pleased
her
better
than
to
go
to
bed
with
a
brain
titivated
with
the
mysteries
of
the
last
three
chapters
nothing
gave
her
such
infinite
delight
as
to
find
when
the
final
pages
were
turned
that
all
her
own
theories
were
wrong
and
that
the
real
criminal
was
somebody
quite
other
than
the
person
she
had
fancied
for
a
novelist
who
was
so
little
master
of
his
trade
as
to
let
you
see
when
and
how
things
were
going
miss
penkridge
had
little
but
pity
for
one
who
led
you
by
all
sorts
of
devious
tracks
to
a
startling
and
surprising
sensation
she
cherished
a
love
but
for
the
creator
of
a
plot
who
could
keep
his
secret
alive
and
burning
to
his
last
few
sentences
she
felt
the
deepest
thing
that
she
could
give
to
any
human
being
respect
such
a
master
was
entered
permanently
on
her
mental
library
list
at
precisely
ten
that
evening
viner
read
the
last
page
of
a
novel
which
had
proved
to
be
exactly
suited
to
his
aunt
tastes
a
dead
silence
fell
on
the
room
broken
only
by
the
crackling
of
the
logs
in
the
grate
miss
penkridge
dropped
her
knitting
on
her
knees
and
stared
at
the
leaping
flames
her
nephew
with
an
odd
glance
at
her
rose
from
his
picked
up
a
pipe
and
began
to
fill
it
from
a
on
the
mantelpiece
the
clock
had
ticked
several
times
before
miss
penkridge
spoke
well
she
said
with
the
accompanying
sigh
which
denotes
complete
content
so
he
did
it
now
i
should
never
have
thought
it
the
last
person
of
the
whole
lot
clever
very
clever
richard
you
get
all
the
books
that
that
man
has
written
viner
lighted
his
pipe
thrust
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
and
leaned
back
against
the
mantelpiece
my
dear
aunt
he
said
you
worse
than
a
whatever
makes
a
shrewd
old
lady
like
you
cherish
such
an
insensate
fancy
for
this
sort
of
stuff
stuff
demanded
miss
penkridge
who
had
resumed
her
knitting
pooh
it
not
stuff
it
life
real
life
in
the
form
of
fiction
viner
shook
his
head
pityingly
he
never
read
fiction
for
his
own
amusement
his
tastes
in
reading
lay
elsewhere
in
solid
directions
moreover
in
those
directions
he
was
a
good
deal
of
a
student
and
he
knew
more
of
his
own
library
than
of
the
world
outside
it
so
he
shook
his
head
again
life
he
said
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
think
those
things
he
pointed
a
finger
to
a
pile
of
novels
which
had
come
in
from
mudie
that
day
really
represent
life
what
else
demanded
miss
penkridge
oh
i
do
know
replied
viner
vaguely
fancy
i
suppose
and
imagination
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
invention
you
know
and
so
on
but
life
do
you
really
think
such
things
happen
in
real
life
as
those
we
been
reading
about
i
do
think
anything
about
it
retorted
miss
penkridge
sturdily
sure
of
it
i
never
had
a
novel
yet
nor
heard
one
read
to
me
that
was
half
as
strong
as
it
might
have
been
queer
thing
one
never
hears
or
sees
of
these
things
then
exclaimed
viner
i
never
have
and
i
been
on
this
planet
thirty
years
that
sort
of
thing
has
come
your
way
richard
remarked
miss
penkridge
sententiously
and
you
do
read
the
popular
sunday
newspapers
i
do
they
full
of
crime
of
all
sorts
so
the
world
and
as
to
mysteries
well
i
known
of
two
or
three
in
my
time
that
were
much
more
extraordinary
than
any
i
ever
read
of
in
novels
i
should
think
so
viner
dropped
into
his
and
stretched
his
legs
such
as
what
he
asked
well
answered
miss
penkridge
regarding
her
knitting
with
appraising
eyes
there
was
a
case
that
excited
great
interest
when
your
poor
mother
and
i
were
mere
girls
it
was
in
our
town
young
quainton
the
banker
he
was
about
your
age
married
to
a
very
pretty
girl
and
they
a
fine
baby
he
was
immensely
rich
a
strong
healthy
young
fellow
fond
of
life
popular
without
a
care
in
the
world
so
far
as
any
one
knew
one
morning
after
breakfasting
with
his
wife
he
walked
away
from
his
house
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
only
a
very
small
town
mind
you
to
go
to
the
bank
as
usual
he
never
reached
the
bank
in
fact
he
was
never
seen
again
never
heard
of
again
he
only
half
a
mile
to
walk
along
a
fairly
frequented
road
but
complete
absolute
final
disappearance
and
never
cleared
up
odd
agreed
viner
very
odd
indeed
well
any
more
plenty
said
miss
penkridge
with
a
click
of
her
needles
there
was
the
case
of
poor
young
lady
marshflower
as
sweet
a
young
thing
as
man
could
wish
to
see
your
mother
and
i
saw
her
married
she
was
a
ravenstone
and
only
nineteen
she
married
sir
thomas
marshflower
a
man
of
forty
they
only
just
come
home
from
the
honeymoon
when
it
happened
one
morning
sir
thomas
rode
into
the
to
preside
at
the
petty
sessions
he
had
been
long
gone
when
a
fine
man
called
and
asked
to
see
lady
marshflower
he
was
shown
into
the
she
went
to
him
five
minutes
later
a
shot
was
heard
the
servants
rushed
in
to
find
their
young
mistress
shot
through
the
heart
dead
but
the
murderer
disappeared
as
completely
as
last
year
snow
that
was
never
solved
never
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
the
man
was
never
caught
exclaimed
viner
i
tell
you
that
not
only
was
the
man
never
caught
but
that
although
sir
thomas
spent
a
fortune
and
nearly
lost
his
senses
in
trying
to
find
out
who
he
was
what
he
wanted
and
what
he
had
to
do
with
lady
marshflower
he
never
discovered
one
single
fact
affirmed
miss
penkridge
there
that
queerer
than
the
other
observed
viner
a
veritable
mystery
veritable
mysteries
said
miss
penkridge
with
a
sniff
the
full
of
how
many
murders
go
undetected
how
many
burglaries
are
never
traced
how
many
forgeries
are
done
and
never
found
out
piles
of
as
the
police
could
tell
you
and
talking
about
forgeries
what
about
old
barrett
who
was
great
man
at
pumpney
when
your
mother
and
i
were
girls
there
that
was
a
fine
case
of
crime
going
on
for
years
and
years
and
years
undetected
aye
and
not
even
suspected
what
was
it
asked
viner
who
had
begun
by
being
amused
and
was
now
becoming
interested
who
was
barrett
if
you
known
pumpney
when
we
lived
there
replied
miss
penkridge
you
would
have
had
to
ask
twice
who
samuel
barrett
was
he
was
everybody
he
was
everything
except
honest
but
nobody
knew
that
until
it
was
too
late
he
was
a
solicitor
by
profession
but
that
was
a
mere
nothing
in
comparison
he
was
chief
spirit
in
the
place
i
do
know
how
many
times
he
was
mayor
of
pumpney
he
held
all
sorts
of
offices
he
was
a
big
man
at
the
parish
church
vicar
warden
and
all
that
and
he
was
trustee
for
half
the
moneyed
people
in
the
town
everybody
wanted
samuel
barrett
for
trustee
or
executor
he
was
such
a
solid
respectable
man
the
personification
of
integrity
and
he
died
suddenly
and
then
it
was
found
that
he
led
a
double
life
and
had
an
establishment
here
in
london
and
was
a
gambler
and
a
speculator
and
heaven
knows
what
and
all
the
money
that
had
been
intrusted
to
him
was
nowhere
and
he
systematically
forged
and
cooked
accounts
and
embezzled
corporation
money
and
he
no
doubt
have
gone
on
doing
it
for
many
a
year
longer
if
he
had
had
a
stroke
of
apoplexy
and
that
was
in
a
novel
concluded
miss
penkridge
triumphantly
novels
improbability
pooh
judged
by
what
some
people
can
tell
of
life
the
novel
that
improbable
has
yet
been
written
well
remarked
viner
after
a
pause
i
dare
say
you
right
aunt
bethia
only
you
see
i
have
come
across
the
things
in
life
that
you
read
about
in
novels
you
may
yet
replied
miss
penkridge
but
when
anybody
says
to
me
of
a
novel
that
it
impossible
and
and
so
on
i
always
inclined
to
remind
him
of
the
old
adage
for
you
can
take
it
from
me
richard
that
truth
is
stranger
than
fiction
and
that
life
full
of
queer
things
only
as
you
say
we
do
all
come
across
the
strange
things
the
silvery
chime
of
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
caused
miss
penkridge
at
this
point
to
bring
her
work
and
her
words
to
a
summary
conclusion
hurrying
her
knitting
into
the
which
she
carried
at
her
belt
she
rose
kissed
her
nephew
and
departed
bedward
while
viner
after
refilling
his
pipe
proceeded
to
carry
out
another
nightly
proceeding
which
had
become
a
habit
every
night
throughout
the
year
he
always
went
for
a
walk
before
going
to
bed
and
now
getting
into
an
overcoat
and
pulling
a
soft
cap
over
his
head
he
let
himself
out
of
the
house
and
crossing
the
square
turned
down
a
and
marched
slowly
in
the
direction
of
the
bayswater
road
november
though
it
was
the
night
was
fine
and
clear
and
there
was
a
in
the
heavens
also
there
was
rather
more
than
a
suspicion
of
frost
in
the
air
and
the
stars
accordingly
wore
a
more
brilliant
appearance
to
one
who
loved
night
strolling
as
viner
did
this
was
indeed
an
ideal
night
for
the
time
of
year
and
on
this
occasion
therefore
he
went
further
than
usual
going
along
bayswater
road
as
far
as
notting
hill
gate
and
thence
returning
through
the
various
streets
and
terraces
which
lay
between
pembridge
gardens
and
markendale
square
and
while
he
strolled
along
smoking
his
pipe
watching
the
twinkling
lights
of
passing
vehicles
and
enjoying
the
touch
of
frost
he
was
thinking
in
a
way
of
his
aunt
bethia
taste
for
the
sensational
fiction
and
of
her
evidently
sincere
conviction
that
there
were
much
stranger
things
in
real
life
than
could
be
found
between
the
covers
of
any
novel
those
were
certainly
two
very
odd
instances
which
she
gave
me
he
mused
those
of
the
prosperous
banker
and
the
pretty
bride
in
the
first
how
on
earth
did
the
man
contrive
to
get
away
unobserved
from
a
town
in
which
presumably
every
soul
knew
him
why
did
he
go
did
he
go
is
his
body
lying
at
the
bottom
of
some
hole
by
some
roadside
was
he
murdered
in
broad
daylight
on
a
public
road
did
he
lose
his
reason
or
his
memory
and
wander
away
and
away
i
think
as
my
aunt
sagely
remarked
that
nobody
is
ever
going
to
find
anything
about
that
affair
then
my
lady
marshflower
there
a
fine
mystery
who
was
the
man
what
did
she
know
about
him
where
had
they
met
had
they
ever
met
why
did
he
shoot
her
how
on
earth
did
he
contrive
to
disappear
without
leaving
some
trace
how
at
this
point
viner
musings
and
questionings
were
suddenly
and
rudely
interrupted
unconsciously
he
had
walked
back
close
to
his
own
square
but
on
the
opposite
side
to
that
by
which
he
had
left
it
approaching
it
by
one
of
the
numerous
long
terraces
which
run
out
of
the
main
road
in
the
westbourne
grove
district
when
his
musings
were
rudely
interrupted
between
this
terrace
and
markendale
square
was
a
narrow
passage
little
frequented
save
by
residents
or
by
such
folk
familiar
enough
with
the
neighbourhood
to
know
that
it
afforded
a
shortcut
viner
was
about
to
turn
into
this
passage
a
dark
affair
set
between
high
walls
when
a
young
man
darted
hurriedly
out
of
it
half
collided
with
him
uttered
a
hasty
word
of
apology
ran
across
the
road
and
disappeared
round
the
nearest
corner
but
just
there
stood
a
and
in
its
glare
viner
caught
sight
of
the
hurrying
young
man
face
and
when
the
retreating
footsteps
had
grown
faint
viner
still
stood
staring
in
the
direction
in
which
they
had
gone
that
strange
he
muttered
i
seen
that
chap
somewhere
i
know
him
now
who
is
he
and
what
made
him
in
such
a
deuce
of
a
hurry
it
was
very
quiet
at
that
point
there
seemed
to
be
nobody
about
behind
him
far
down
the
long
wide
terrace
he
heard
slow
measured
steps
that
of
course
was
a
policeman
on
his
beat
but
beyond
the
subdued
murmur
of
the
traffic
in
the
bayswater
road
in
one
direction
and
in
bishop
road
viner
heard
nothing
but
those
measured
steps
and
after
listening
to
them
for
a
minute
he
turned
into
the
passage
out
of
which
the
young
man
had
just
rushed
so
unceremoniously
there
was
just
one
lamp
in
that
passage
an
affair
fixed
against
the
wall
halfway
down
it
threw
but
little
light
on
its
surroundings
those
surroundings
were
ordinary
enough
the
passage
itself
was
about
thirty
yards
in
length
it
was
inclosed
on
by
old
brick
walls
so
old
that
the
brick
had
grown
black
with
age
and
smoke
these
walls
were
some
fifteen
feet
in
height
here
and
there
they
were
pierced
by
doors
the
doors
of
the
yards
at
the
rear
of
the
big
houses
on
either
side
the
doors
were
set
flush
with
the
walls
viner
who
often
walked
through
that
passage
at
night
and
who
had
something
of
a
whimsical
fancy
had
thought
more
than
once
that
after
nightfall
the
doors
looked
as
if
they
had
never
been
opened
never
shut
there
was
an
air
of
queer
cloistral
or
prisonlike
security
in
their
very
look
they
were
all
shut
now
as
he
paced
down
the
passage
as
lonely
a
place
at
that
hour
as
you
could
find
in
all
london
it
was
queer
he
reflected
that
he
scarcely
ever
remembered
meeting
anybody
in
that
passage
and
then
he
suddenly
paused
pulling
himself
up
with
a
strange
consciousness
that
at
last
he
was
to
meet
something
beneath
the
feeble
light
of
the
one
lamp
viner
saw
a
man
not
a
man
walking
or
standing
still
or
leaning
against
the
wall
but
lying
full
length
across
the
flagged
pavement
motionless
so
motionless
that
at
the
end
of
the
first
moment
of
surprise
viner
felt
sure
that
he
was
in
the
presence
of
death
and
then
he
stole
nearer
listening
and
looked
down
and
drawing
his
from
his
pocket
added
the
flash
of
a
match
to
the
poor
rays
from
above
then
he
saw
white
linen
and
a
bloodstain
slowly
spreading
over
its
glossy
surface
chapter
ii
number
seven
in
the
square
before
the
sputter
of
the
match
had
died
out
viner
had
recognized
the
man
who
lay
dead
at
his
feet
he
was
a
man
about
whom
he
had
recently
felt
some
curiosity
a
man
who
a
few
weeks
before
had
come
to
live
in
a
house
close
to
his
own
in
company
with
an
elderly
lady
and
a
pretty
girl
viner
and
miss
penkridge
had
often
seen
all
three
in
and
about
markendale
square
and
had
wondered
who
they
were
the
man
looked
as
if
he
had
seen
things
in
life
a
big
burly
bearded
man
of
apparently
sixty
years
of
age
hard
bronzed
something
about
him
suggested
sun
and
wind
as
they
are
met
with
in
the
places
usually
he
was
seen
in
loose
comfortable
suits
of
blue
serge
there
was
a
roll
in
his
walk
that
suggested
the
sea
but
here
as
he
lay
before
viner
he
was
in
evening
dress
with
a
light
overcoat
thrown
over
it
the
overcoat
was
unbuttoned
and
the
exposed
and
on
it
that
sickening
crimson
stain
widened
and
widened
as
viner
watched
here
without
doubt
was
murder
and
viner
thoughts
immediately
turned
to
two
things
one
the
hurrying
young
man
whose
face
he
thought
he
had
remembered
in
some
vague
fashion
the
other
the
fact
that
a
policeman
was
slowly
pacing
up
the
terrace
close
by
he
turned
and
ran
swiftly
up
the
still
deserted
passage
and
there
was
the
policeman
twenty
yards
away
coming
along
with
the
leisureliness
of
one
who
knows
that
he
has
a
certain
area
to
patrol
he
pulled
himself
to
an
attitude
of
watchful
attention
as
viner
ran
up
to
him
then
suddenly
recognizing
viner
as
a
inhabitant
of
the
square
touched
the
rim
of
his
helmet
i
say
said
viner
in
the
hushed
voice
of
one
who
imparts
strange
and
confidential
tidings
there
a
man
lying
dead
in
the
passage
round
here
and
without
doubt
murdered
there
blood
all
over
his
the
policeman
stood
stock
still
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
then
he
pulled
out
his
whistle
and
blew
loudly
and
insistently
before
the
shrill
call
had
died
away
he
was
striding
towards
the
passage
with
viner
at
his
side
did
you
find
him
mr
viner
he
asked
i
found
him
asserted
viner
just
now
halfway
down
the
passage
sure
he
dead
sir
dead
yes
and
murdered
too
and
he
was
about
to
mention
the
hurrying
young
man
but
they
had
just
then
arrived
at
the
mouth
of
the
passage
and
the
policeman
once
more
drew
out
his
whistle
and
blew
more
insistently
than
before
there
my
sergeant
and
inspector
not
far
off
he
remarked
some
of
be
on
the
spot
in
a
minute
or
two
now
then
sir
he
marched
down
the
passage
to
the
dead
man
glanced
at
the
lamp
and
turning
on
his
own
lantern
directed
its
light
on
the
body
god
bless
me
he
muttered
mr
ashton
you
know
him
said
viner
gent
that
came
to
live
at
number
seven
in
your
square
a
while
back
viner
answered
the
policeman
australian
or
new
zealander
i
fancy
he
gone
right
enough
sir
and
knifed
you
did
see
anybody
about
sir
yes
replied
viner
that
just
it
as
i
turned
into
the
passage
i
met
a
young
fellow
running
out
of
it
in
a
great
hurry
he
ran
into
me
and
then
shot
off
across
the
road
westbourne
grove
way
then
i
came
along
and
found
this
the
policeman
bent
lower
and
suddenly
put
a
knowing
finger
on
certain
of
the
dead
man
pockets
robbed
he
said
no
watch
there
anyway
and
nothing
where
expect
to
find
his
purse
robbery
and
murder
murder
for
the
sake
of
robbery
that
what
it
is
viner
westbourne
grove
way
you
say
this
fellow
went
and
five
minutes
start
is
it
any
good
getting
a
doctor
asked
viner
a
thousand
doctors
do
him
no
good
replied
the
policeman
grimly
but
there
cortelyon
somewhere
about
here
number
seven
in
the
terrace
one
of
these
back
doors
is
his
we
might
call
him
he
turned
the
light
of
his
lantern
on
the
line
of
doors
in
the
wall
and
finding
the
number
he
wanted
pulled
the
bell
as
its
tinkle
sounded
somewhere
up
the
yard
behind
he
thrust
his
whistle
into
viner
hand
viner
he
said
go
up
to
the
end
of
the
passage
and
blow
on
that
as
loud
as
you
can
three
times
i
stand
by
here
till
you
come
back
if
you
do
hear
or
see
any
of
our
people
coming
from
either
direction
blow
again
viner
heard
steps
coming
down
the
yard
behind
the
door
as
he
walked
away
and
he
heard
more
steps
hurrying
steps
as
he
reached
the
end
of
the
passage
he
turned
it
to
find
an
inspector
and
a
sergeant
approaching
from
one
part
of
the
terrace
a
constable
from
another
you
wanted
down
here
said
viner
as
they
all
converged
on
him
there
been
murder
one
of
your
men
there
he
gave
me
this
whistle
to
summon
further
help
this
way
the
police
followed
him
in
silence
down
the
passage
another
figure
had
come
on
the
scene
bending
over
the
body
and
closely
scrutinizing
it
in
the
light
of
the
policeman
lantern
was
a
man
whom
viner
knew
well
enough
by
sight
a
tall
handsome
man
whose
complexion
large
lustrous
eyes
and
vandyke
beard
gave
him
the
appearance
of
a
foreigner
yet
though
he
had
often
seen
him
viner
did
not
know
his
name
the
however
evidently
knew
it
well
enough
what
is
it
dr
cortelyon
he
asked
as
he
pushed
himself
to
the
front
is
the
man
dead
cortelyon
drew
himself
up
from
his
stooping
position
to
his
full
height
a
striking
figure
in
his
dress
jacket
and
immaculate
linen
he
glanced
round
at
the
expectant
faces
the
man
been
murdered
he
said
in
calm
professional
accents
been
stabbed
clean
through
the
heart
dead
yes
for
several
minutes
who
found
him
here
demanded
the
inspector
i
found
him
answered
viner
he
gave
a
hurried
account
of
the
whole
circumstances
as
he
knew
them
the
police
watching
him
keenly
i
should
know
the
man
again
if
i
saw
him
he
concluded
i
saw
his
face
clearly
enough
as
he
passed
me
the
inspector
bent
down
and
hastily
felt
the
dead
man
pockets
nothing
at
all
here
he
said
as
he
straightened
himself
no
watch
or
chain
or
purse
or
anything
looks
like
robbery
as
well
as
murder
does
anybody
know
him
i
know
who
this
gentlemen
is
sir
answered
the
policeman
to
whom
viner
had
first
gone
he
a
ashton
who
came
to
live
not
so
long
since
at
number
seven
in
markendale
square
close
by
viner
there
i
heard
that
he
came
from
the
colonies
do
you
know
him
asked
the
inspector
turning
to
viner
only
by
sight
answered
viner
i
seen
him
often
but
i
did
know
his
name
i
believe
he
has
a
wife
and
daughter
no
sir
interrupted
the
policeman
he
was
a
single
gentleman
the
young
lady
at
number
seven
is
his
ward
and
the
older
lady
looked
after
her
sort
of
a
companion
the
inspector
looked
round
other
policemen
attracted
by
the
whistle
were
coming
into
the
passage
at
each
end
and
he
turned
to
his
sergeant
put
a
man
at
the
top
and
another
at
the
bottom
of
this
passage
he
said
keep
everybody
out
send
for
the
divisional
surgeon
cortelyon
will
you
see
him
when
he
comes
along
i
want
him
to
see
the
body
before
its
removal
now
then
about
these
ladies
they
have
to
be
told
he
turned
to
viner
i
understand
you
live
close
by
them
he
asked
perhaps
you
go
there
with
me
viner
nodded
and
the
inspector
after
giving
a
few
more
words
of
instruction
to
the
sergeant
motioned
him
to
follow
together
they
went
down
the
passage
into
markendale
square
been
resident
here
long
mr
viner
asked
the
inspector
as
they
emerged
i
noticed
that
some
of
my
men
knew
you
i
only
recently
come
into
this
part
myself
fifteen
years
answered
viner
do
you
know
anything
of
this
dead
man
nothing
not
so
much
as
your
constable
knows
policemen
pick
things
up
these
ladies
now
it
a
most
unpleasant
thing
to
have
to
go
and
break
news
like
this
you
know
nothing
about
them
sir
not
even
as
much
as
your
man
knew
i
seen
them
often
with
him
the
dead
man
there
an
elderly
lady
and
a
younger
one
a
mere
girl
i
took
them
for
his
wife
and
daughter
but
you
heard
what
your
man
said
well
whatever
they
are
they
got
to
be
told
i
be
obliged
if
come
with
me
and
then
that
fellow
you
saw
running
away
you
have
to
give
us
as
near
a
description
of
him
as
you
can
what
number
did
my
man
say
it
was
seven
viner
suddenly
laid
a
hand
on
his
companion
sleeve
a
smart
car
of
the
sort
let
out
on
hire
from
the
more
pretentious
automobile
establishments
had
just
come
round
the
corner
and
was
being
pulled
up
at
the
door
of
a
house
in
whose
porticoed
front
hung
a
brilliant
lamp
that
number
seven
said
viner
and
those
are
the
two
ladies
the
inspector
stopped
and
watched
the
door
of
the
house
opened
letting
a
further
flood
of
light
on
the
broad
step
beneath
the
portico
and
on
the
pavement
beyond
the
door
of
the
car
opened
too
and
a
girl
stepped
out
and
for
a
second
or
two
stood
in
the
full
glare
of
the
lamps
she
was
a
slender
lissome
young
creature
gowned
in
white
and
muffled
to
the
throat
in
an
opera
cloak
out
of
which
a
fresh
girlish
face
bright
in
colour
sparkling
of
eye
crowned
by
a
mass
of
hair
of
the
tint
of
dead
gold
showed
clearly
ere
she
rapidly
crossed
to
the
open
door
after
her
came
an
elderly
woman
in
an
elaborate
evening
toilette
the
personification
of
the
precise
and
conventional
chaperon
the
door
closed
the
car
drove
away
the
inspector
turned
to
viner
with
a
shake
of
his
head
just
home
from
the
theatre
he
said
and
to
hear
this
well
it
got
to
be
done
viner
anyhow
viner
who
had
often
observed
the
girl
whom
they
had
just
seen
with
an
interest
for
which
he
had
never
troubled
to
account
found
himself
wishing
that
miss
penkridge
was
there
in
his
place
he
did
not
know
what
part
he
was
to
play
what
he
was
to
do
or
say
worse
than
that
he
did
not
know
if
the
girl
in
whose
presence
he
would
certainly
find
himself
within
a
minute
or
two
was
very
fond
of
the
man
whom
he
had
just
found
done
to
death
in
that
case
but
here
his
musings
were
cut
short
by
the
fact
that
the
inspector
had
touched
the
bell
in
the
portico
of
number
seven
and
that
the
door
had
opened
to
reveal
a
smart
and
wondering
who
glanced
with
surprise
at
the
inspector
uniform
hush
this
is
mr
ashton
said
the
inspector
yes
well
now
what
is
the
name
of
the
lady
the
elderly
lady
i
saw
come
in
just
now
keep
quiet
there
a
good
girl
the
fact
is
ashton
had
an
accident
and
i
want
to
see
that
lady
killenhall
answered
the
and
the
young
lady
her
name
asked
the
inspector
miss
wickham
the
inspector
walked
inside
the
house
just
ask
killenhall
and
miss
wickham
if
they
be
good
enough
to
see
inspector
drillford
for
a
few
minutes
he
said
then
as
the
girl
closed
the
door
and
turned
away
up
the
inner
hall
he
whispered
to
viner
better
see
both
and
be
done
with
it
it
no
use
keeping
bad
news
too
long
they
may
as
well
know
both
the
reappeared
at
the
door
of
a
room
along
the
hall
and
the
two
men
advancing
in
answer
to
her
summons
entered
what
was
evidently
the
of
the
house
the
two
ladies
had
thrown
off
their
wraps
the
younger
one
sat
near
a
big
cheery
fire
holding
her
slender
fingers
to
the
blaze
the
elder
stood
facing
the
door
in
evident
expectancy
the
room
itself
was
luxuriously
furnished
in
a
somewhat
heavy
style
everything
about
it
betokened
wealth
and
comfort
and
that
its
owner
was
expected
home
every
minute
was
made
evident
to
the
two
men
by
the
fact
that
a
was
set
on
the
centre
table
with
glasses
and
mineral
waters
and
cigars
viner
remembered
as
his
eyes
encountered
these
things
that
a
cigar
lay
close
to
the
dead
man
hand
in
that
dark
passage
so
close
by
killenhall
miss
wickham
began
drillford
looking
sharply
from
one
to
the
other
sorry
to
break
in
on
you
like
this
ladies
but
the
fact
is
there
has
been
an
accident
to
ashton
and
i
obliged
to
come
and
tell
you
about
it
viner
who
had
remained
a
little
in
the
background
was
watching
the
faces
of
the
two
to
whom
this
initial
breaking
of
news
was
made
and
he
saw
at
once
that
there
was
going
to
be
no
scene
the
girl
by
the
fire
looked
for
an
instant
at
the
inspector
with
an
expression
of
surprise
but
it
was
not
the
surprise
of
great
personal
concern
as
for
the
elder
woman
after
one
quick
glance
from
drillford
to
viner
whom
she
evidently
recognized
she
showed
absolute
a
bad
accident
she
asked
drillford
again
looked
from
the
elder
to
the
younger
lady
you
excuse
me
if
i
ask
what
relation
you
ladies
are
to
mr
ashton
he
said
with
a
significant
glance
at
killenhall
none
replied
killenhall
miss
wickham
is
ashton
ward
i
am
miss
wickham
chaperon
and
companion
well
said
drillford
then
i
may
tell
you
that
my
news
is
just
about
as
serious
as
it
possibly
could
be
you
understand
in
the
silence
that
followed
the
girl
turned
toward
the
visitors
and
viner
saw
her
colour
change
a
little
and
it
was
she
who
first
spoke
do
be
afraid
to
tell
us
she
said
is
ashton
dead
drillford
inclined
his
head
and
spoke
as
he
was
bidden
i
sorry
to
say
he
is
he
replied
and
still
more
to
be
obliged
to
tell
you
that
he
came
to
his
death
by
violence
the
truth
is
he
paused
looking
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
to
gauge
the
effect
of
his
words
and
again
it
was
the
girl
who
spoke
what
is
the
truth
she
asked
murder
said
drillford
just
that
killenhall
who
had
remained
standing
until
then
suddenly
sat
down
with
a
murmur
of
horror
but
the
girl
was
watching
the
inspector
steadily
when
was
this
and
how
and
where
she
inquired
a
little
time
ago
near
here
answered
drillford
this
gentleman
viner
a
neighbour
of
yours
found
him
dead
there
no
doubt
from
what
we
can
see
that
he
was
murdered
for
the
sake
of
robbery
and
i
want
some
information
about
him
about
his
habits
and
miss
wickham
got
up
from
her
chair
and
looked
meaningly
at
killenhall
the
fact
is
she
said
turning
to
drillford
strange
as
it
may
seem
neither
killenhall
nor
myself
know
very
much
about
mr
ashton
chapter
iii
who
was
ashton
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
entered
the
room
drillford
turned
and
glanced
at
viner
his
look
indicated
the
idea
which
miss
wickham
last
words
had
set
up
in
his
mind
here
was
a
mystery
the
police
instinct
was
aroused
by
it
you
do
know
very
much
about
mr
ashton
he
said
turning
back
to
the
two
ladies
yet
you
under
his
roof
this
is
his
house
is
it
just
so
assented
miss
wickham
but
when
i
say
we
do
know
much
i
mean
what
i
say
killenhall
has
only
known
ashton
a
few
weeks
and
until
two
months
ago
i
had
not
seen
ashton
for
twelve
years
therefore
neither
of
us
can
know
much
about
him
would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
do
know
asked
drillford
we
got
to
know
something
who
he
is
and
so
on
all
that
i
know
is
this
replied
miss
wickham
my
father
died
in
australia
when
i
was
about
six
years
old
my
mother
was
already
dead
and
my
father
left
me
in
charge
of
ashton
he
sent
me
very
soon
after
my
father
death
to
school
in
england
and
there
i
remained
for
twelve
years
about
two
months
ago
ashton
came
to
england
took
this
house
fetched
me
from
school
and
got
killenhall
to
look
after
me
here
we
all
been
ever
since
and
beyond
that
i
know
scarcely
anything
drillford
looked
at
the
elder
lady
i
know
practically
no
more
than
miss
wickham
has
told
you
said
killenhall
ashton
and
i
got
in
touch
with
each
other
through
his
advertisement
in
the
we
exchanged
references
and
i
came
here
ah
said
drillford
and
what
might
his
references
be
now
to
his
bankers
the
london
and
orient
in
threadneedle
street
answered
killenhall
promptly
and
to
his
solicitors
crawle
pawle
and
rattenbury
of
bedford
bow
very
satisfactory
they
were
no
doubt
suggested
drillford
killenhall
let
her
eye
run
round
the
appointments
of
the
room
eminently
so
she
said
dryly
ashton
was
a
very
wealthy
man
drillford
pulled
out
a
pocketbook
and
entered
the
names
which
killenhall
had
just
mentioned
the
solicitors
will
be
able
to
tell
something
he
murmured
as
he
put
the
book
back
we
communicate
with
them
first
thing
in
the
morning
but
just
two
questions
before
i
go
can
you
tell
me
anything
about
ashton
usual
habits
had
he
any
business
what
did
he
do
with
his
time
he
was
out
a
great
deal
said
killenhall
he
used
to
go
down
to
the
city
he
was
often
out
of
an
evening
once
since
i
came
here
he
was
away
for
a
week
in
the
country
he
did
say
where
he
was
an
active
man
always
in
and
out
but
he
never
said
much
as
to
where
he
went
the
other
question
said
drillford
is
this
did
he
carry
much
on
him
in
the
way
of
valuables
or
money
i
mean
as
a
rule
he
wore
a
very
fine
gold
watch
and
chain
answered
killenhall
and
as
for
money
well
he
always
seemed
to
have
a
lot
in
his
purse
and
he
wore
two
diamond
rings
very
fine
stones
just
so
murmured
drillford
set
upon
for
the
sake
of
those
things
no
doubt
well
ladies
i
shall
telephone
to
crawle
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
they
send
somebody
along
at
once
of
course
i
sorry
to
have
brought
you
such
bad
news
but
he
turned
toward
the
door
miss
wickham
stopped
him
will
ashton
body
be
brought
here
tonight
she
asked
no
replied
drillford
it
will
be
taken
to
the
mortuary
if
leave
everything
to
me
i
see
that
you
are
spared
as
much
as
possible
of
course
there
have
to
be
an
inquest
but
you
hear
all
about
that
tomorrow
leave
things
to
us
and
to
ashton
solicitors
he
moved
towards
the
door
and
viner
until
then
a
silent
spectator
looked
at
miss
wickham
something
impelling
him
to
address
her
instead
of
killenhall
i
live
close
by
you
he
said
if
there
is
anything
that
i
can
do
or
that
my
aunt
miss
penkridge
who
lives
with
me
can
do
perhaps
you
will
let
me
call
in
the
morning
the
girl
looked
at
him
steadily
and
frankly
thank
you
viner
she
said
it
would
be
very
kind
if
you
would
we
no
men
folk
yes
please
do
after
breakfast
then
answered
viner
and
went
away
to
join
the
inspector
who
had
walked
into
the
hall
what
do
you
think
of
this
matter
he
asked
when
they
had
got
outside
the
house
oh
a
very
clear
and
ordinary
case
enough
viner
replied
drillford
no
mystery
about
it
at
all
here
this
ashton
been
living
here
some
weeks
some
fellow
the
man
of
course
whom
you
saw
running
away
has
noticed
that
he
was
a
very
rich
man
and
wore
expensive
jewellery
has
watched
him
probably
knew
that
he
used
that
passage
as
a
short
cut
and
has
laid
in
wait
for
him
and
murdered
him
for
what
got
on
him
it
would
take
two
minutes
to
do
the
whole
thing
rings
now
they
spoke
of
diamond
rings
in
there
well
i
did
see
any
diamond
rings
on
his
hands
when
i
looked
at
his
body
and
i
particularly
noticed
his
hands
to
see
if
there
were
signs
of
any
struggle
no
sir
it
just
a
plain
case
of
what
used
to
be
called
highway
robbery
and
murder
but
come
round
with
me
to
the
viner
they
have
taken
him
to
the
mortuary
by
now
and
i
should
like
to
hear
what
our
divisional
surgeon
has
to
say
and
what
our
people
actually
found
on
the
body
as
viner
and
the
inspector
walked
into
the
cortelyon
came
out
drillford
stopped
him
found
out
anything
more
doctor
he
asked
nothing
beyond
what
i
said
at
first
replied
cortelyon
the
man
has
been
stabbed
through
the
heart
from
behind
in
one
particularly
blow
i
should
say
the
murderer
had
waited
for
him
in
that
passage
probably
knowing
his
habits
that
passage
now
you
know
it
really
will
have
to
be
seen
to
that
wretched
old
lamp
in
the
middle
gives
no
light
at
all
the
wonder
is
that
something
of
this
sort
occurred
before
drillford
muttered
something
about
local
authorities
and
and
went
forward
into
an
office
motioning
viner
to
follow
the
divisional
surgeon
was
there
in
conversation
with
the
sergeant
whom
drillford
had
left
in
charge
of
the
body
that
is
something
on
which
stake
my
professional
reputation
he
said
i
sure
of
it
what
that
doctor
asked
drillford
something
to
do
with
this
affair
i
was
saying
that
whoever
stabbed
this
unfortunate
man
had
some
knowledge
of
anatomy
remarked
the
doctor
he
was
killed
by
one
swift
blow
from
a
particularly
weapon
which
was
driven
through
his
back
at
the
exact
spot
you
ought
to
make
a
minute
search
behind
the
walls
on
either
side
of
that
passage
the
probability
is
that
the
murderer
threw
his
weapon
away
we
do
all
that
doctor
said
drillford
as
to
your
suggestion
do
you
forget
that
there
are
a
good
many
criminals
here
in
london
who
are
regular
experts
in
the
use
of
the
knife
i
seen
plenty
of
instances
of
that
myself
now
he
went
on
turning
to
the
sergeant
about
that
search
what
did
you
find
on
him
the
sergeant
lifted
the
lid
of
a
desk
and
pointed
to
a
sheet
of
foolscap
paper
whereon
lay
certain
small
articles
at
which
viner
gazed
with
a
sense
of
strange
fascination
a
penknife
a
small
gold
matchbox
a
some
silver
coins
a
handkerchief
and
conspicuous
among
the
rest
a
farthing
that
the
lot
said
the
sergeant
except
another
handkerchief
and
a
pair
of
gloves
in
the
overcoat
where
i
left
them
nothing
else
no
watch
chain
purse
or
pocketbook
and
no
rings
but
it
very
plain
from
his
fingers
that
he
wore
two
rings
one
on
each
hand
third
finger
in
each
case
there
you
are
said
drillford
with
a
glance
at
viner
murdered
and
robbed
clear
case
now
viner
give
us
as
accurate
a
description
as
possible
of
the
fellow
who
ran
out
of
that
passage
viner
did
his
best
his
recollections
were
of
a
young
man
of
about
his
own
age
about
his
own
height
and
build
somewhat
above
the
medium
it
was
his
impression
he
said
that
the
man
was
dressed
if
not
shabbily
at
least
poorly
he
had
an
impression
too
that
the
face
which
he
had
seen
for
a
brief
moment
was
thin
and
worn
got
any
recollection
of
his
exact
look
inquired
the
inspector
a
lot
to
go
by
i
trying
to
think
said
viner
yes
i
should
say
he
looked
to
be
pretty
there
was
a
sort
of
desperate
gleam
in
his
eye
and
take
your
time
remarked
drillford
anything
you
can
suggest
you
know
well
replied
viner
i
an
idea
at
the
moment
and
i
had
it
since
that
i
seen
this
man
before
something
in
his
face
was
familiar
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
is
this
i
potter
round
old
bookshops
and
a
good
deal
i
may
have
seen
this
young
fellow
on
some
occasion
of
that
sort
anyway
suggested
drillford
glancing
over
the
particulars
which
he
had
written
down
you
know
him
again
if
you
saw
him
oh
certainly
asserted
viner
i
should
know
him
anywhere
then
that
all
we
need
trouble
you
with
now
sir
said
drillford
the
next
business
will
be
tomorrow
viner
walked
slowly
out
of
the
and
still
more
slowly
homeward
when
he
reached
the
first
lamp
he
drew
out
his
watch
twelve
just
two
hours
ago
he
had
been
in
his
own
comfortable
library
smiling
at
miss
penkridge
ideas
about
the
very
matters
into
one
of
which
he
was
now
plunged
he
would
not
have
been
surprised
if
he
had
suddenly
awoke
to
find
that
all
this
was
a
bad
dream
induced
by
the
evening
conversation
but
just
then
he
came
to
the
passage
in
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
a
policeman
was
on
guard
at
the
terrace
end
and
viner
rather
than
hear
any
more
of
the
matter
hastened
past
him
and
made
a
circuitous
way
to
markendale
square
he
let
himself
into
his
house
as
quietly
as
possible
and
contrary
to
taste
and
custom
went
into
the
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
helped
himself
to
a
stiff
glass
of
brandy
and
soda
at
the
sideboard
when
the
mixture
was
duly
prepared
he
forgot
to
drink
it
he
stood
by
the
sideboard
the
glass
in
his
hand
his
eyes
staring
at
vacancy
nor
did
he
move
when
a
very
light
foot
stole
down
the
stairs
and
miss
penkridge
in
wraps
and
looked
round
the
side
of
the
door
heavens
above
richard
she
exclaimed
what
is
the
matter
i
wondered
if
you
were
burglars
twelve
viner
suddenly
became
aware
of
the
glass
which
he
was
unconsciously
holding
he
lifted
it
to
his
lips
wondering
whatever
it
was
that
made
his
mouth
feel
so
dry
and
when
he
had
taken
a
big
gulp
and
then
spoke
his
voice
to
himself
sounded
just
as
queer
as
his
tongue
had
been
feeling
you
were
right
he
said
suddenly
there
are
queerer
stranger
affairs
in
life
than
one
fancies
and
i
i
been
pitchforked
thrown
clean
into
the
middle
of
things
i
miss
penkridge
came
closer
to
him
staring
she
looked
from
him
to
the
glass
from
the
glass
to
him
no
i
have
been
drinking
said
viner
with
a
harsh
laugh
drinking
now
and
i
going
to
have
another
too
listen
he
pushed
her
gently
into
a
chair
and
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
told
her
the
adventure
and
miss
penkridge
who
was
an
admirable
listener
to
fictitious
tales
of
horror
proved
herself
no
less
admirable
in
listening
to
one
of
plain
fact
and
made
no
comment
until
her
nephew
had
finished
that
poor
man
she
said
at
last
such
a
fine
strong
man
too
i
used
to
wonder
about
him
when
i
saw
him
in
the
square
i
used
to
think
of
him
as
somebody
who
seen
things
viner
made
a
sudden
grimace
do
he
said
ugh
i
seen
things
tonight
that
i
never
wished
to
see
and
i
wish
what
demanded
miss
penkridge
after
a
pause
during
which
viner
had
sat
staring
at
the
floor
i
wish
to
god
i
never
seen
that
poor
devil
who
was
running
away
exclaimed
viner
with
sudden
passion
they
catch
him
and
i
shall
have
to
give
evidence
against
him
and
my
evidence
hang
him
and
there
a
lot
to
do
and
a
lot
happen
before
that
comes
off
richard
interrupted
miss
penkridge
the
man
may
be
innocent
he
have
a
nice
job
to
prove
it
said
viner
with
a
forced
laugh
no
if
the
police
get
him
besides
he
was
running
straight
from
the
place
is
it
a
queer
thing
he
went
on
laughing
again
i
do
mind
remembering
the
the
dead
man
but
i
hate
the
recollection
of
that
chap
hurrying
away
i
wonder
what
it
feels
like
when
you
just
murdered
another
fellow
to
slink
off
like
you
no
business
to
be
wondering
any
such
thing
said
miss
penkridge
sharply
here
get
yourself
another
brandy
and
soda
and
let
us
talk
business
these
two
women
did
they
feel
it
much
they
puzzled
me
replied
viner
he
took
his
aunt
advice
about
the
extra
glass
and
obeyed
her
too
when
she
silently
pointed
to
a
box
of
cigars
which
lay
on
the
sideboard
all
right
he
said
after
a
minute
or
two
i
not
going
to
have
nerves
what
was
i
saying
they
puzzled
me
yes
puzzled
especially
the
girl
she
seemed
so
collected
about
everything
and
yet
according
to
her
own
story
she
only
just
out
of
the
schoolroom
you
go
round
there
with
me
if
we
can
be
of
any
service
to
them
certainly
assented
miss
penkridge
the
girl
said
they
no
men
folk
remarked
viner
in
that
case
i
shall
certainly
go
said
miss
penkridge
now
richard
smoke
your
cigar
and
think
no
more
about
all
this
till
tomorrow
viner
flung
himself
into
an
all
right
he
said
do
bother
it
been
a
bit
of
a
facer
but
he
was
astonished
when
he
woke
the
next
morning
much
later
than
was
his
wont
to
find
that
he
had
not
dreamed
about
the
events
of
the
midnight
and
he
was
his
usual
practical
and
self
when
at
eleven
he
stood
waiting
in
the
hall
for
miss
penkridge
to
go
round
with
him
to
number
seven
but
the
visit
was
not
to
be
paid
just
then
as
they
were
about
to
leave
the
house
a
came
hurrying
up
and
accosted
viner
inspector
drillford
compliments
and
would
viner
come
round
and
then
the
messenger
gave
a
knowing
grin
we
got
the
man
sir
he
whispered
that
why
you
wanted
chapter
iv
the
ring
and
the
knife
viner
was
hoping
that
the
police
had
got
hold
of
the
wrong
man
as
he
reluctantly
walked
into
drillford
office
but
one
glance
at
the
inspector
confident
face
alert
and
smiling
showed
him
that
drillford
himself
had
no
doubts
on
that
point
well
viner
he
said
with
a
triumphant
laugh
we
have
been
so
long
about
it
you
see
much
quicker
work
than
i
anticipated
too
are
you
sure
you
got
the
right
man
asked
viner
i
mean
have
you
got
the
man
i
saw
running
away
from
the
passage
you
shall
settle
that
yourself
answered
drillford
come
this
way
he
led
viner
down
a
corridor
through
one
or
two
locked
doors
and
motioning
him
to
tread
softly
drew
back
a
sliding
panel
in
the
door
of
a
cell
and
silently
pointed
viner
with
a
worse
sickness
than
before
stole
up
and
looked
through
the
barred
opening
one
glance
at
the
man
sitting
inside
the
cell
staring
at
the
drab
bare
wall
was
enough
he
turned
to
drillford
and
nodded
drillford
nodded
too
and
led
him
back
to
the
office
that
the
man
i
saw
said
viner
of
course
assented
drillford
i
no
doubt
of
it
well
it
been
a
far
simpler
thing
than
i
dared
to
hope
i
tell
you
how
we
got
him
this
morning
about
ten
this
chap
who
wo
give
his
name
went
into
the
pawnbroker
shop
in
edgware
road
and
asked
for
a
loan
on
a
diamond
ring
which
he
produced
now
pelver
who
happened
to
attend
to
him
himself
is
a
good
deal
of
an
expert
in
diamonds
he
a
jeweller
as
well
as
a
pawnbroker
and
he
saw
at
once
that
the
diamond
in
this
ring
was
well
worth
all
of
a
thousand
pounds
a
gem
of
the
first
water
he
was
therefore
considerably
astonished
when
his
customer
asked
for
a
loan
of
ten
pounds
on
it
still
more
so
when
the
fellow
suggested
that
pelver
should
buy
it
outright
for
pelver
asked
him
some
questions
as
to
his
property
in
the
ring
he
made
some
excuses
about
its
having
been
in
his
family
for
some
time
and
that
he
would
be
glad
to
realize
on
it
under
pretence
of
examining
it
pelver
took
the
ring
to
another
part
of
his
shop
and
quietly
sent
for
a
policeman
and
the
end
was
this
officer
brought
the
man
here
and
pelver
with
him
and
the
ring
here
it
is
he
opened
a
safe
and
produced
a
diamond
ring
at
which
viner
stared
with
feelings
for
which
he
could
scarcely
account
how
do
you
know
that
one
of
ashton
rings
he
asked
oh
i
soon
solved
that
laughed
drillford
i
hurried
round
to
markendale
square
with
it
at
once
both
the
ladies
recognized
it
ashton
had
often
shown
it
to
them
and
told
them
its
value
and
there
a
private
mark
of
his
inside
it
and
so
we
arrested
him
and
there
he
is
clear
case
what
did
he
say
asked
viner
he
a
curious
customer
replied
drillford
i
should
say
that
whatever
he
is
now
he
has
been
a
gentleman
he
was
extremely
nervous
and
so
on
while
we
were
questioning
him
about
the
ring
but
when
it
came
to
the
crucial
point
and
i
charged
him
and
warned
him
he
turned
strangely
cool
i
tell
you
what
he
said
in
his
exact
words
absolutely
innocent
of
that
he
said
i
can
see
that
i
placed
myself
in
a
very
strange
position
and
after
that
he
would
say
no
more
he
even
asked
to
see
a
solicitor
what
will
be
done
next
asked
viner
he
be
brought
before
the
magistrate
in
an
hour
or
two
said
drillford
formal
proceedings
for
a
remand
you
know
i
shall
want
you
there
viner
it
wo
take
long
i
wish
the
fellow
would
tell
us
who
he
is
and
i
wish
i
could
remember
where
and
when
i
have
seen
him
before
exclaimed
viner
ah
that
still
your
impression
remarked
drillford
you
still
convinced
of
it
more
than
ever
since
seeing
him
just
now
affirmed
viner
i
know
his
face
but
that
all
i
can
say
i
suppose
he
continued
looking
diffidently
at
the
inspector
as
if
he
to
be
laughed
at
for
the
suggestion
he
was
about
to
make
i
suppose
you
do
believe
that
this
unfortunate
fellow
may
have
some
explanation
of
his
possession
of
ashton
ring
drillford
who
had
been
replacing
the
ring
in
a
safe
locked
the
door
upon
it
with
a
snap
and
turned
on
his
questioner
with
a
look
which
became
more
and
more
businesslike
and
official
with
each
succeeding
word
now
viner
he
said
you
look
at
it
from
our
point
of
view
an
elderly
gentleman
is
murdered
and
robbed
a
certain
man
is
seen
by
you
as
it
happens
running
away
as
fast
as
he
can
from
the
scene
of
the
murder
next
morning
that
very
man
is
found
trying
to
get
rid
of
a
ring
which
without
doubt
was
taken
from
the
murdered
man
finger
what
do
you
think
or
another
question
what
could
we
police
officials
do
nothing
but
what
you
doing
i
suppose
said
viner
still
there
may
be
a
good
deal
that
what
shall
i
say
behind
all
this
it
for
him
to
speak
observed
drillford
nodding
in
the
direction
of
the
cells
he
got
a
bell
within
reach
of
his
fingers
he
only
got
to
ring
it
and
to
ask
for
me
or
any
solicitor
he
likes
to
name
but
we
shall
see
nothing
had
been
seen
or
heard
in
the
way
hinted
at
by
drillford
when
an
hour
later
viner
waiting
in
the
neighbouring
was
aware
that
the
humdrum
sordid
routine
was
about
to
be
interrupted
by
something
unusual
the
news
of
an
arrest
in
connection
with
the
lonsdale
passage
murder
had
somehow
leaked
out
and
the
court
was
packed
to
the
doors
viner
himself
had
gradually
been
forced
into
a
corner
near
the
in
which
he
was
to
make
an
unwilling
appearance
and
from
that
corner
he
looked
with
renewed
interest
at
the
man
who
was
presently
placed
in
the
dock
and
for
the
hundredth
time
asked
himself
what
it
was
in
his
face
that
woke
some
chord
of
memory
in
him
there
was
nothing
of
the
criminal
in
the
accused
man
appearance
apparently
about
thirty
years
of
age
spare
of
figure
of
a
decidedly
intellectual
type
of
countenance
he
looked
like
an
actor
his
suit
of
tweed
was
well
cut
and
had
evidently
been
carefully
kept
in
spite
of
its
undoubtedly
threadbare
condition
it
and
the
worn
and
haggard
look
of
the
man
face
denoted
poverty
if
not
recent
actual
privation
and
the
thought
was
present
in
more
than
one
mind
there
in
possession
of
certain
facts
if
this
man
had
really
owned
the
ring
which
he
had
offered
to
the
pawnbroker
why
had
he
delayed
so
long
in
placing
himself
in
funds
through
its
means
for
if
his
face
expressed
anything
it
was
hunger
viner
who
was
now
witnessing
proceedings
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
felt
an
almost
morbid
curiosity
in
hearing
the
tale
unfolded
against
the
prisoner
for
some
reason
best
known
to
themselves
the
police
brought
forward
more
evidence
than
was
usual
on
first
proceedings
before
a
magistrate
viner
himself
proved
the
finding
of
the
body
the
divisional
surgeon
spoke
as
to
the
cause
of
death
the
dead
solicitor
testified
to
his
identity
and
swore
positively
as
to
the
ring
the
pawnbroker
gave
evidence
as
to
the
prisoner
attempt
to
pawn
or
sell
the
ring
that
morning
finally
the
police
proved
that
on
searching
the
prisoner
after
his
arrest
a
knife
was
found
in
his
which
in
the
opinion
of
the
divisional
surgeon
would
have
caused
the
wound
found
in
the
dead
man
body
from
a
superficial
aspect
no
case
could
have
seemed
clearer
but
in
viner
reckoning
of
things
there
was
mystery
two
episodes
occurred
during
the
comparatively
brief
proceedings
which
made
him
certain
that
all
was
not
being
brought
out
the
first
was
when
he
himself
went
into
the
to
prove
his
discovery
of
the
body
and
to
swear
that
the
prisoner
was
the
man
he
had
seen
running
away
from
the
passage
the
accused
glanced
at
him
with
evident
curiosity
as
he
came
forward
on
hearing
viner
name
he
looked
at
him
in
a
strange
manner
changed
colour
and
turned
his
head
away
but
when
a
certain
question
was
put
to
viner
he
looked
round
again
evidently
anxious
to
hear
the
answer
i
believe
you
thought
on
first
seeing
him
that
the
prisoner
face
was
familiar
to
you
mr
viner
yes
i
certainly
think
that
i
have
seen
him
before
somewhere
you
ca
recollect
more
you
do
know
when
or
where
you
saw
him
i
do
but
that
i
have
seen
him
perhaps
met
him
somewhere
i
am
certain
this
induced
the
magistrate
to
urge
the
accused
man
who
had
steadfastly
refused
to
give
name
or
address
to
reveal
his
identity
but
the
prisoner
only
shook
his
head
i
would
rather
not
give
my
name
at
present
he
answered
i
am
absolutely
innocent
of
this
charge
of
murder
but
i
quite
realize
that
the
police
are
fully
justified
in
bringing
it
against
me
i
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
ashton
death
nothing
perhaps
the
police
will
find
out
the
truth
and
meanwhile
i
had
rather
not
give
my
name
you
will
be
well
advised
to
reconsider
that
said
the
magistrate
if
you
are
innocent
as
you
say
it
will
be
far
better
for
you
to
say
who
you
are
and
to
see
a
solicitor
as
things
are
you
are
in
a
very
dangerous
position
but
the
prisoner
shook
his
head
not
yet
at
any
rate
he
answered
i
want
to
hear
more
when
the
proceedings
were
over
and
the
accused
formally
remanded
for
a
week
had
been
removed
to
the
cells
previous
to
being
taken
away
viner
went
round
to
drillford
office
look
here
he
said
abruptly
finding
the
inspector
alone
i
dare
say
you
think
i
very
foolish
but
i
do
believe
that
chap
murdered
ashton
i
do
believe
it
for
one
second
drillford
who
was
filling
up
some
papers
smiled
no
he
said
now
why
mr
viner
you
can
call
it
intuition
if
you
like
answered
viner
but
i
do
and
i
shall
be
surprised
if
i
not
right
there
are
certain
things
that
i
should
think
would
strike
you
what
for
instance
asked
drillford
do
you
think
it
likely
that
a
man
who
must
have
known
that
a
regular
hue
and
cry
would
be
raised
about
that
murder
would
be
such
a
fool
as
to
go
and
offer
one
of
the
murdered
man
rings
within
a
mile
of
the
spot
where
the
murder
took
place
asked
viner
drillford
turned
and
looked
steadily
at
his
questioner
well
but
that
precisely
what
he
did
mr
viner
he
exclaimed
there
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
ring
in
question
was
ashton
there
also
no
doubt
that
this
man
did
offer
it
to
pelver
this
morning
either
the
fellow
is
a
fool
or
singularly
ignorant
to
do
such
a
mad
thing
but
he
did
it
and
i
know
why
why
then
demanded
viner
because
he
was
just
starving
answered
drillford
when
he
was
brought
in
here
straight
from
pelver
he
had
a
halfpenny
on
him
and
in
the
very
thick
of
my
questionings
and
just
think
how
important
they
were
he
stopped
me
i
say
a
word
that
just
now
much
more
important
to
me
than
all
this
he
said
starving
i
have
touched
food
or
drink
for
nearly
three
days
give
me
something
if
it
only
a
crust
of
bread
that
fact
mr
viner
what
did
you
do
inquired
viner
got
the
poor
chap
some
breakfast
at
once
answered
drillford
and
let
him
alone
till
he
finished
have
you
ever
seen
a
starved
dog
eat
no
well
i
have
and
he
ate
like
that
he
was
ravenous
and
when
a
at
that
stage
do
you
think
he
going
to
stop
at
anything
not
he
this
fellow
you
may
be
sure
after
killing
and
robbing
ashton
had
but
one
thought
how
soon
he
could
convert
some
of
the
property
into
cash
so
that
he
could
eat
if
pelver
had
made
him
that
advance
or
bought
the
ring
he
have
made
a
for
the
nearest
i
tell
you
he
was
mad
for
food
another
thing
said
viner
where
is
the
rest
of
property
his
watch
chain
the
other
ring
his
purse
and
was
there
a
pocketbook
how
is
it
this
man
was
found
in
possession
of
them
easy
enough
for
him
to
hide
all
those
things
viner
said
drillford
with
an
indulgent
smile
what
easier
you
do
know
as
much
of
these
things
as
i
do
he
could
quite
easily
plant
all
those
articles
safely
during
the
night
he
just
stuck
to
the
article
which
he
could
most
easily
convert
into
money
well
i
do
believe
he
guilty
repeated
viner
and
i
want
to
do
something
for
him
you
may
think
me
quixotic
but
i
like
to
help
him
is
there
anything
to
prevent
you
from
going
to
him
telling
him
that
i
convinced
of
his
innocence
and
that
i
should
like
to
get
him
help
legal
help
there
nothing
to
prevent
it
to
be
sure
answered
drillford
but
viner
you
ca
get
over
the
fact
that
this
fellow
had
ashton
diamond
ring
in
his
possession
how
do
i
how
do
you
know
how
he
came
into
possession
of
it
demanded
viner
and
then
that
knife
exclaimed
drillford
look
here
i
got
it
what
sort
of
thing
is
that
for
an
innocent
harmless
man
to
carry
about
him
it
an
american
he
opened
a
drawer
and
exhibited
a
weapon
which
lying
on
a
pile
of
paper
looked
singularly
suggestive
and
fearsome
i
do
care
said
viner
with
a
certain
amount
of
stubbornness
convinced
that
the
man
did
kill
ashton
and
i
want
to
help
him
i
a
man
of
considerable
means
and
in
this
case
well
that
how
i
feel
about
it
drillford
made
no
answer
but
presently
he
left
the
room
after
pointing
viner
to
a
chair
viner
waited
five
ten
minutes
then
the
door
opened
again
and
drillford
came
back
behind
him
walked
the
accused
man
with
a
couple
of
policemen
in
attendance
upon
him
there
mr
viner
said
drillford
you
can
speak
to
him
yourself
viner
rose
from
his
chair
the
prisoner
stepped
forward
regarding
him
earnestly
viner
he
said
in
a
low
concentrated
tone
do
you
know
me
i
langton
hyde
you
and
i
were
at
rugby
together
and
we
meet
again
here
chapter
v
look
for
that
man
at
these
words
viner
drew
back
with
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
but
in
the
next
instant
he
stepped
forward
again
holding
out
his
hand
hyde
he
said
then
that
what
i
remembered
of
course
i
know
you
but
good
heavens
man
what
does
all
this
mean
what
brought
you
to
this
to
be
here
in
this
place
the
prisoner
looked
round
at
his
captors
and
back
at
viner
and
smiled
as
a
man
smiles
who
is
beginning
to
realize
hopelessness
to
the
full
i
do
know
if
i
allowed
to
speak
he
said
drillford
who
had
been
watching
this
episode
with
keen
attention
motioned
to
the
two
policemen
wait
outside
he
said
abruptly
now
then
he
continued
when
he
viner
and
hyde
were
alone
this
man
can
say
anything
he
likes
to
you
viner
so
long
as
you
asked
to
see
him
this
is
all
irregular
but
i
no
wish
to
stop
him
from
telling
you
whatever
he
pleases
but
remember
he
went
on
glancing
at
the
prisoner
you
saying
it
before
me
and
in
my
opinion
you
a
deal
better
have
said
something
when
you
were
in
court
just
now
i
did
know
what
to
say
replied
hyde
doubtfully
i
pretty
much
on
the
rocks
as
you
can
guess
but
i
have
relatives
and
if
possible
i
do
want
them
to
know
about
this
drillford
looked
at
viner
and
shook
his
head
as
if
to
signify
his
contempt
of
hyde
attitude
considering
the
position
you
in
he
said
turning
again
to
hyde
you
must
see
that
it
impossible
that
your
relations
should
be
kept
from
knowing
you
have
to
give
particulars
about
yourself
sooner
or
later
and
charges
of
murder
like
this
ca
be
kept
out
of
the
newspapers
tell
me
hyde
exclaimed
viner
look
here
now
to
begin
with
you
did
kill
this
man
hyde
shook
his
head
in
a
puzzled
fashion
something
was
evidently
causing
him
surprise
i
did
know
the
man
was
killed
or
dead
until
they
brought
me
here
from
that
pawnbroker
this
morning
he
said
then
he
laughed
almost
contemptuously
and
with
some
slight
show
of
spirit
do
you
think
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
try
to
pawn
or
sell
a
ring
that
belonged
to
a
man
who
just
been
murdered
he
demanded
i
not
quite
such
an
ass
as
that
viner
looked
round
at
drillford
there
he
said
quietly
what
did
i
tell
you
is
that
what
i
said
you
on
the
wrong
track
inspector
but
drillford
sternly
official
in
manner
shook
his
head
how
did
he
come
by
the
ring
then
he
asked
pointing
at
his
prisoner
let
him
say
hyde
said
viner
tell
i
been
certain
for
an
hour
that
you
kill
this
man
and
i
want
to
help
you
but
tell
us
the
truth
what
do
you
know
about
it
how
did
you
get
that
ring
i
shall
make
use
of
anything
he
tells
remarked
drillford
warningly
he
going
to
tell
everything
said
viner
come
now
hyde
the
truth
hyde
suddenly
dropped
into
a
chair
by
which
he
was
standing
and
pressed
his
hand
over
his
face
with
a
gesture
which
seemed
to
indicate
a
certain
amount
of
bewilderment
let
me
sit
down
he
said
i
weak
tired
too
until
this
morning
i
had
had
a
mouthful
of
food
for
a
long
time
and
i
well
i
been
walking
about
night
as
well
as
day
i
was
walking
about
all
yesterday
and
a
lot
of
last
night
i
pretty
nearly
done
if
you
want
to
know
take
your
time
said
drillford
here
wait
a
bit
he
went
on
after
a
sudden
glance
at
his
prisoner
keep
quiet
a
minute
he
turned
to
a
cupboard
in
the
corner
of
the
room
and
presently
came
back
with
something
in
a
glass
drink
that
he
said
not
unkindly
drop
of
weak
brandy
and
water
he
muttered
to
viner
do
him
no
harm
i
see
how
it
is
with
him
he
been
starving
hyde
caught
the
last
word
and
laughed
feebly
as
he
handed
the
glass
back
starving
he
said
yes
that
it
i
hope
neither
of
you
know
what
it
means
three
days
without
now
hyde
interrupted
viner
never
mind
that
you
wo
starve
again
come
tell
us
all
about
this
tell
everything
hyde
bent
forward
in
his
chair
but
after
a
look
at
the
two
men
his
eyes
sought
the
floor
and
moved
from
one
plank
to
another
as
if
he
found
it
difficult
to
find
a
fixed
point
i
do
know
where
to
begin
viner
he
said
at
last
you
see
never
met
me
since
we
left
school
i
went
in
for
medicine
i
was
at
bart
for
a
time
but
well
i
was
no
good
somehow
and
then
i
went
in
for
the
stage
i
had
some
fairly
decent
engagements
both
here
and
in
the
states
now
and
then
but
you
know
what
a
precarious
business
that
is
and
some
time
ago
i
struck
a
real
bad
patch
and
i
been
out
of
a
job
for
months
and
lately
it
gone
from
bad
to
worse
you
know
or
rather
i
suppose
you
do
know
because
you
never
been
in
that
fix
pawning
everything
and
so
on
until
well
i
have
had
a
penny
in
my
pockets
for
days
now
your
relations
questioned
viner
did
want
them
to
know
answered
hyde
the
fact
is
i
have
been
on
good
terms
with
them
for
a
long
time
and
i
got
some
pride
left
or
i
had
until
yesterday
but
here
the
truth
i
had
to
clear
out
of
my
lodgings
which
was
nothing
but
an
attic
three
days
since
and
i
been
wandering
about
literally
hungry
and
homeless
since
that
if
it
had
been
for
that
i
should
never
have
been
in
this
hole
and
that
due
to
circumstances
that
beat
me
for
i
tell
you
again
i
know
anything
about
this
man
murder
at
least
not
about
it
actually
what
do
you
know
asked
viner
tell
us
plainly
i
going
to
responded
hyde
i
was
hanging
about
the
park
and
around
kensington
gardens
most
of
yesterday
then
at
night
i
got
wandering
about
this
part
did
seem
to
matter
much
where
i
went
you
do
know
either
of
you
what
it
means
to
wander
round
starving
you
get
into
a
sort
of
comatose
state
you
just
go
on
and
on
well
last
night
i
was
walking
in
that
way
in
and
out
about
these
bayswater
squares
i
got
into
markendale
square
as
i
was
going
along
the
top
side
of
it
i
noticed
a
passage
and
turned
into
it
as
i
said
when
a
man
in
the
state
i
was
in
it
does
matter
where
he
slouches
anywhere
i
turned
into
that
passage
i
tell
you
just
aimlessly
as
a
man
came
walking
out
viner
look
for
that
man
find
him
he
the
fellow
these
police
want
if
there
been
murder
keep
calm
hyde
said
viner
go
on
quietly
this
man
passed
me
and
went
on
into
the
square
continued
hyde
i
went
up
the
passage
it
was
very
dark
except
in
the
middle
where
there
an
lamp
and
then
i
saw
another
man
who
was
lying
across
the
flags
i
do
know
that
i
any
impression
about
him
i
was
too
sick
and
weary
i
believe
i
thought
he
was
drunk
or
ill
or
something
but
you
see
at
the
same
instant
that
i
saw
him
i
saw
something
else
which
drove
him
clean
out
of
my
mind
in
fact
as
soon
as
i
seen
it
i
never
thought
about
him
any
more
nor
looked
at
him
again
what
was
it
demanded
viner
certain
of
what
the
answer
would
be
a
diamond
ring
replied
hyde
it
was
lying
on
the
flags
close
by
the
man
the
light
from
the
lamp
fell
full
on
it
and
i
snatched
it
up
thrust
it
into
my
pocket
and
ran
up
the
passage
i
ran
into
somebody
at
the
far
end
it
turns
out
to
have
been
you
well
you
saw
me
hurry
off
i
got
as
far
away
as
i
could
lest
you
or
somebody
else
should
follow
i
wandered
round
westbourne
grove
and
then
up
into
the
harrow
road
and
in
a
sort
of
back
street
there
i
sneaked
into
a
shanty
in
a
yard
and
stopped
in
it
the
rest
of
the
night
and
this
morning
i
tried
to
pawn
the
ring
having
no
idea
of
its
value
suggested
viner
with
a
glance
at
drillford
who
was
listening
to
everything
with
an
immovable
countenance
i
thought
it
might
be
worth
thirty
or
forty
pounds
answered
hyde
of
course
i
no
idea
that
it
was
worth
what
been
said
you
see
fairly
presentable
and
i
thought
i
could
tell
a
satisfactory
story
if
i
was
asked
anything
at
the
pawnshop
i
did
anticipate
any
difficulty
about
pawning
the
ring
i
do
think
there
have
been
any
if
it
been
for
its
value
a
thousand
pounds
of
course
i
no
idea
of
that
and
that
the
whole
truth
asked
viner
it
the
whole
truth
as
far
as
i
concerned
answered
hyde
i
certainly
picked
up
that
ring
in
that
passage
close
by
this
man
who
was
lying
there
but
i
did
know
he
was
dead
i
did
know
he
been
murdered
all
i
know
is
that
i
was
absolutely
famishing
desperate
in
no
condition
to
think
clearly
about
anything
i
guess
i
should
do
the
same
thing
again
under
the
circumstances
i
only
wish
he
paused
and
began
muttering
to
himself
and
the
two
listeners
glanced
at
each
other
you
only
wish
what
hyde
asked
viner
i
wish
it
had
been
a
instead
of
that
ring
said
hyde
with
a
queer
flashing
glance
at
his
audience
i
could
have
got
a
bed
for
fourpence
and
have
lived
for
three
days
on
the
rest
and
now
viner
made
no
remark
and
drillford
who
was
leaning
against
his
desk
watching
his
prisoner
closely
tapped
hyde
on
the
shoulder
can
you
describe
the
man
who
came
out
of
the
passage
as
you
entered
it
he
asked
be
accurate
now
hyde
face
brightened
a
little
and
his
eyes
became
more
intelligent
yes
he
answered
you
know
or
you
do
know
how
your
mental
faculties
get
sharpened
by
hunger
i
was
dull
enough
in
one
way
but
alert
enough
in
another
i
can
describe
the
man
as
much
as
i
saw
of
him
a
tall
man
neither
broad
nor
slender
dressed
in
black
from
top
to
toe
a
silk
hat
patent
leather
boots
and
muffled
to
the
eyes
in
a
white
silk
handkerchief
could
you
see
his
face
asked
drillford
was
he
or
bearded
or
what
i
tell
you
he
was
muffled
to
the
very
eyes
answered
hyde
one
of
those
big
silk
handkerchiefs
you
know
he
had
it
drawn
up
over
his
chin
and
nose
right
up
then
you
have
difficulty
in
knowing
him
again
observed
drillford
there
are
a
few
thousand
men
in
the
west
end
of
london
who
answer
the
description
you
given
all
right
muttered
hyde
doggedly
but
i
know
what
i
saw
and
if
you
want
to
help
me
viner
find
that
man
because
he
must
have
come
straight
away
from
the
body
drillford
turned
to
viner
glancing
at
the
same
time
at
the
clock
do
you
want
to
ask
him
any
more
questions
he
inquired
no
well
there
just
one
i
want
to
ask
what
were
you
doing
with
that
knife
in
your
possession
he
went
on
turning
to
hyde
be
careful
now
you
heard
what
the
doctor
said
about
it
in
court
i
nothing
to
conceal
replied
hyde
you
heard
me
say
just
now
that
i
had
engagements
in
the
states
i
bought
that
knife
when
i
was
out
west
more
as
a
curiosity
than
anything
and
i
carried
it
in
my
pocket
ever
since
drillford
looked
again
at
viner
he
have
to
go
now
he
said
if
you
going
to
employ
legal
help
for
him
the
solicitor
will
know
where
and
when
he
can
see
him
he
paused
on
his
way
to
the
door
and
looked
a
little
doubtfully
at
his
prisoner
i
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
he
said
not
as
an
official
but
as
an
individual
if
you
want
to
clear
yourself
you
better
give
all
the
information
you
can
i
send
my
own
solicitor
to
you
hyde
at
once
said
viner
be
absolutely
frank
with
him
about
everything
when
viner
was
once
more
alone
with
drillford
the
two
men
looked
at
each
other
my
own
impression
said
viner
after
a
significant
silence
is
that
we
have
just
heard
the
plain
truth
i
going
to
work
on
it
anyway
in
that
case
viner
there
no
need
for
me
to
say
anything
remarked
drillford
it
may
be
the
plain
truth
but
as
i
am
what
i
am
all
i
know
is
the
evidence
against
this
young
fellow
so
he
really
was
a
schoolmate
of
yours
certainly
said
viner
his
people
live
or
did
live
in
the
north
i
shall
have
to
get
into
communication
with
them
but
now
what
about
the
information
he
gave
you
this
man
he
saw
drillford
shook
his
head
viner
he
answered
you
do
understand
police
methods
we
got
very
strong
evidence
against
hyde
we
know
nothing
about
a
tall
man
in
a
white
muffler
if
you
want
to
clear
hyde
you
better
do
what
he
suggested
find
that
man
i
wish
you
may
if
he
ever
existed
you
do
believe
hyde
asked
viner
i
not
required
to
believe
anything
sir
unless
i
good
proof
of
it
said
drillford
with
a
significant
smile
if
there
is
any
mystery
in
this
murder
well
let
hope
something
will
clear
it
up
viner
went
away
troubled
and
thoughtful
he
remembered
hyde
well
enough
now
though
so
many
years
had
elapsed
since
their
last
meeting
and
he
was
genuinely
convinced
of
his
innocence
there
had
been
a
ring
of
truth
in
all
that
he
had
said
who
then
was
the
guilty
man
and
had
robbery
been
the
real
motive
of
the
murder
might
it
not
have
been
that
ashton
had
been
murdered
for
some
quite
different
motive
and
that
the
murderer
had
hastily
removed
the
watch
chain
purse
and
rings
from
the
body
with
the
idea
of
diverting
suspicion
and
in
his
haste
had
dropped
one
of
the
rings
if
only
one
knew
more
about
ashton
and
his
affairs
mused
viner
even
his
own
people
do
seem
to
know
much
this
reminded
him
of
his
promise
to
call
on
miss
wickham
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
not
yet
one
the
proceedings
before
the
magistrate
and
the
subsequent
talk
with
hyde
had
occupied
comparatively
little
time
so
viner
walked
rapidly
to
number
seven
in
the
square
intent
on
doing
something
toward
clearing
hyde
of
the
charge
brought
against
him
the
whom
he
had
seen
the
night
before
admitted
him
at
once
it
seemed
to
viner
that
he
was
expected
she
led
him
straight
to
a
room
in
which
killenhall
and
miss
wickham
were
in
conversation
with
an
elderly
man
who
looked
at
viner
with
considerable
curiosity
when
his
name
was
mentioned
and
who
was
presently
introduced
to
him
as
ashton
solicitor
pawle
of
crawle
pawle
and
rattenbury
chapter
vi
speculations
pawle
an
little
man
whom
viner
at
once
recognized
as
having
been
present
in
the
magistrate
court
when
hyde
was
brought
up
smiled
as
he
shook
hands
with
the
new
visitor
you
do
know
me
viner
he
said
but
i
knew
your
father
very
well
he
and
i
did
a
lot
of
business
together
in
our
time
you
followed
his
profession
i
gather
i
afraid
i
have
any
profession
pawle
answered
viner
i
a
student
and
a
bit
a
very
little
bit
of
a
writer
aye
well
your
father
was
a
bit
in
that
way
too
remarked
pawle
i
remember
that
he
was
a
great
collector
of
books
you
have
his
library
no
doubt
yes
and
i
always
adding
to
it
said
viner
i
shall
be
glad
to
show
you
my
additions
any
time
pawle
turned
to
the
two
ladies
waving
his
hand
at
viner
knew
his
father
most
intimately
he
said
as
if
he
were
guaranteeing
the
younger
man
status
fine
fellow
was
stephen
viner
well
he
continued
dropping
into
a
chair
and
pointing
viner
to
another
this
is
a
sad
business
that
we
got
concerned
in
young
man
now
what
do
you
think
of
the
proceedings
we
just
heard
your
opinion
viner
is
probably
better
worth
having
than
anybody
for
you
saw
this
fellow
running
away
from
the
scene
and
you
found
my
unfortunate
client
lying
dead
what
frankly
your
opinion
i
had
better
tell
you
something
that
just
happened
replied
viner
he
went
on
to
repeat
the
statements
which
hyde
had
just
made
to
drillford
and
himself
my
opinion
he
concluded
is
that
hyde
is
speaking
the
plain
truth
that
all
he
really
did
was
as
he
affirms
to
pick
up
that
ring
and
run
away
i
do
believe
he
murdered
ashton
and
i
going
to
do
my
best
to
clear
him
he
looked
round
from
one
listener
to
another
seeking
opinion
from
each
pawle
maintained
a
professional
imperturbability
killenhall
looked
mildly
excited
on
hearing
this
new
theory
but
from
miss
wickham
viner
got
a
flash
of
intelligent
comprehension
the
real
thing
is
this
she
said
none
of
us
know
anything
about
ashton
really
he
may
have
had
enemies
pawle
rubbed
his
chin
the
action
suggested
perplexity
miss
wickham
is
quite
right
he
said
ashton
is
more
or
less
a
man
of
mystery
he
had
been
here
in
england
two
months
his
ward
knows
next
to
nothing
about
him
except
that
she
was
left
in
his
guardianship
many
a
year
ago
that
he
sent
her
to
england
to
school
and
that
he
recently
joined
her
here
killenhall
knows
no
more
than
that
he
engaged
her
as
chaperon
to
his
ward
and
that
they
exchanged
references
his
references
were
to
his
bankers
and
to
me
but
neither
his
bankers
nor
i
know
anything
of
him
except
that
he
was
a
very
man
i
can
tell
precisely
what
his
bankers
know
it
is
merely
this
he
transferred
his
from
an
australian
bank
to
them
on
coming
to
london
i
saw
them
this
morning
on
first
getting
the
news
they
have
about
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
lying
to
his
credit
that
absolutely
all
they
know
about
him
all
the
australian
bankers
would
know
more
suggested
viner
precisely
agreed
pawle
we
can
get
news
from
them
in
time
but
now
what
do
i
know
no
more
than
this
ashton
called
on
me
about
six
or
seven
weeks
ago
told
me
that
he
was
an
australian
who
had
come
to
settle
in
london
that
he
was
pretty
well
off
and
that
he
wanted
to
make
a
will
we
drafted
a
will
on
his
instructions
and
he
duly
executed
it
here
it
is
miss
wickham
has
just
seen
it
ashton
has
left
every
penny
he
had
to
miss
wickham
he
told
me
she
was
the
only
child
of
an
old
friend
of
his
who
had
given
her
into
his
care
on
his
death
out
in
australia
some
years
ago
and
that
as
he
ashton
had
no
near
relations
he
had
always
intended
to
leave
her
all
he
had
and
so
he
has
without
condition
or
reservation
or
anything
all
is
yours
miss
wickham
and
i
your
executor
but
now
continued
pawle
how
far
does
this
take
us
toward
solving
the
mystery
of
my
client
death
so
far
as
i
can
see
next
to
nowhere
and
i
am
certain
of
this
viner
if
we
are
going
to
solve
it
and
if
this
old
school
friend
of
yours
is
being
unjustly
accused
and
is
to
be
cleared
we
must
find
out
more
about
doings
since
he
came
to
london
the
secret
lies
there
i
quite
agree
answered
viner
but
who
knows
anything
pawle
looked
at
the
two
ladies
that
a
stiff
question
he
said
the
bankers
tell
me
that
ashton
only
called
on
them
two
or
three
times
he
called
on
me
not
oftener
neither
they
nor
i
ever
had
much
conversation
with
him
these
two
ladies
should
know
more
about
him
than
anybody
but
they
seem
to
know
little
viner
who
was
sitting
opposite
to
her
looked
at
miss
wickham
you
must
know
something
about
his
daily
life
he
said
what
did
he
do
with
himself
we
told
you
and
the
pretty
nearly
all
we
know
last
night
replied
miss
wickham
as
a
rule
he
used
to
go
out
of
a
morning
i
think
from
his
conversation
he
used
to
go
down
to
the
city
i
do
think
it
was
on
business
i
think
he
liked
to
look
about
him
sometimes
he
came
home
to
lunch
sometimes
he
did
very
often
in
the
afternoon
he
took
us
for
into
the
country
sometimes
he
took
us
to
the
theatres
he
used
to
go
out
a
good
deal
alone
at
night
we
do
know
where
did
he
ever
mention
any
club
asked
pawle
no
never
replied
miss
wickham
he
was
reticent
about
himself
always
very
kind
and
thoughtful
and
considerate
for
killenhall
and
myself
but
he
was
a
reserved
man
did
he
ever
have
any
one
to
see
him
inquired
the
solicitor
any
men
to
dine
or
anything
of
that
sort
no
not
once
no
one
has
ever
even
called
on
him
said
miss
wickham
we
have
had
two
or
three
but
the
people
who
came
were
friends
of
mine
two
or
three
girls
whom
i
knew
at
school
who
are
now
married
and
live
in
london
a
lonely
sort
of
man
commented
pawle
yet
he
must
have
known
people
where
did
he
go
when
he
went
into
the
city
where
did
he
go
at
night
there
must
be
somebody
somewhere
who
can
tell
more
about
him
i
think
it
will
be
well
if
i
ask
for
information
through
the
newspapers
there
is
one
matter
we
have
mentioned
said
killenhall
just
after
we
got
settled
down
here
ashton
went
away
for
some
days
three
or
four
days
that
of
course
may
be
quite
insignificant
do
you
know
where
he
went
asked
pawle
no
we
do
know
answered
killenhall
he
went
away
one
monday
morning
saying
that
now
everything
was
in
order
we
could
spare
him
for
a
few
days
he
returned
on
the
following
thursday
or
friday
i
forget
which
but
he
did
tell
us
where
he
had
been
you
do
think
any
of
the
servants
would
know
asked
pawle
oh
dear
me
no
replied
killenhall
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
rarely
speaks
to
his
servants
except
when
he
wanted
something
pawle
looked
at
his
watch
and
rose
well
he
said
we
shall
have
to
find
out
more
about
my
late
habits
and
whom
he
knew
in
london
there
may
have
been
a
motive
for
this
murder
of
which
we
know
nothing
are
you
coming
viner
i
should
like
a
word
with
you
viner
too
had
risen
he
looked
at
miss
wickham
i
hope
my
aunt
called
on
you
this
morning
he
asked
i
was
coming
with
her
but
i
had
to
go
round
to
the
she
did
call
and
she
was
very
kind
indeed
thank
you
said
miss
wickham
i
hope
she
come
again
we
shall
both
be
glad
to
do
anything
said
viner
please
hesitate
about
sending
round
for
me
if
there
anything
at
all
i
can
do
he
followed
pawle
into
the
square
and
turned
him
towards
his
own
house
come
and
lunch
with
me
he
said
we
can
talk
over
this
at
our
leisure
thank
you
i
will
answered
pawle
very
pleased
between
you
and
me
viner
this
is
a
very
queer
business
i
quite
prepared
to
believe
the
story
that
young
fellow
hyde
tells
i
wish
he
told
it
straight
out
in
court
but
you
must
see
that
he
in
a
very
dangerous
position
very
dangerous
indeed
the
police
of
course
wo
credit
a
word
of
his
tale
not
they
they
got
a
strong
case
against
him
and
they
follow
it
up
for
all
they
worth
the
real
thing
to
do
if
you
to
save
him
is
to
find
the
real
murderer
and
to
do
that
you
need
all
your
wits
if
one
only
had
some
theory
viner
introduced
pawle
to
miss
penkridge
with
the
remark
that
she
was
something
of
an
authority
in
mysteries
and
as
soon
as
they
had
sat
down
to
lunch
told
her
of
langton
hyde
and
his
statement
just
so
said
miss
penkridge
dryly
that
much
more
likely
to
be
the
real
truth
than
that
this
lad
killed
ashton
there
a
great
deal
more
in
this
murder
than
is
on
the
surface
and
i
dare
say
pawle
agrees
with
me
i
dare
say
i
do
assented
pawle
the
difficulty
is
how
to
penetrate
into
the
thick
cloak
of
mystery
when
i
was
round
there
at
number
seven
this
morning
observed
miss
penkridge
those
two
talked
very
freely
to
me
about
ashton
now
there
one
thing
struck
me
at
once
there
must
be
men
in
london
who
knew
him
he
could
go
out
and
about
as
he
evidently
did
without
meeting
men
even
if
it
was
in
business
he
meet
men
somewhere
and
if
i
were
you
i
should
invite
men
who
knew
him
to
come
forward
and
tell
what
they
know
it
shall
be
done
very
good
advice
said
pawle
and
there
another
thing
said
miss
penkridge
i
should
find
out
what
can
be
told
about
ashton
where
he
came
from
i
believe
you
can
get
telegraphic
information
from
australia
within
a
few
hours
why
not
go
to
the
expense
when
there
so
much
at
stake
depend
upon
it
the
real
secret
of
this
murder
lies
back
in
the
past
perhaps
the
far
past
that
too
shall
be
done
agreed
pawle
i
should
be
surprised
if
you
right
in
my
opinion
remarked
miss
penkridge
dryly
the
robbing
of
this
dead
man
was
all
a
blind
robbery
was
the
motive
murder
was
the
thing
in
view
and
why
it
may
have
been
revenge
it
may
be
that
ashton
had
to
be
got
out
of
the
way
and
i
should
wonder
a
bit
if
that
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
which
is
at
the
top
and
bottom
of
pretty
nearly
everything
and
that
asked
pawle
who
evidently
admired
miss
penkridge
shrewd
observations
that
is
what
now
money
said
miss
penkridge
money
the
old
solicitor
went
away
promising
to
get
to
work
on
the
lines
suggested
by
miss
penkridge
and
next
day
he
telephoned
to
viner
asking
him
to
go
down
to
his
offices
in
bedford
row
viner
hurried
off
and
on
arriving
found
pawle
with
a
cablegram
before
him
i
sent
a
pretty
long
message
to
melbourne
to
ashton
old
bankers
as
soon
as
i
left
you
yesterday
he
said
i
gave
them
the
news
of
his
murder
and
asked
for
certain
information
here
their
answer
i
rang
you
up
as
soon
as
i
got
it
viner
read
the
cablegram
carefully
deeply
regret
news
ashton
well
known
here
thirty
years
dealer
in
real
estate
respected
wealthy
quiet
man
bachelor
have
made
inquiries
in
quarters
likely
to
know
can
not
trace
anything
about
friend
named
wickham
ashton
was
away
from
melbourne
up
country
four
years
some
years
ago
may
have
known
wickham
then
ashton
left
here
end
july
by
for
london
was
accompanied
by
two
friends
fosdick
and
stephens
please
inform
if
can
do
more
what
do
you
think
of
that
asked
pawle
not
much
in
it
is
there
there
the
mention
of
two
men
who
might
know
something
of
habits
said
viner
if
fosdick
and
stephens
are
still
in
england
and
were
ashton
friends
one
would
naturally
conclude
that
he
seen
them
sometimes
yet
we
have
heard
of
their
ever
going
to
his
house
we
can
be
quite
certain
that
they
never
did
from
what
the
two
ladies
say
remarked
pawle
perhaps
they
do
live
in
london
advertise
for
both
but
now
here
another
matter
i
asked
these
people
if
they
could
tell
me
anything
about
wickham
the
father
of
this
girl
to
whom
ashton
left
his
very
considerable
fortune
well
you
see
they
ca
now
it
a
very
curious
thing
but
miss
wickham
has
no
papers
has
in
fact
nothing
whatever
to
prove
her
identity
nor
have
ashton
left
nothing
of
that
sort
i
know
no
more
and
she
knows
no
more
than
what
he
told
both
of
us
that
her
father
died
when
she
was
a
mere
child
her
mother
already
being
dead
that
the
father
left
her
in
guardianship
and
that
ashton
after
sending
her
here
to
school
eventually
came
and
took
her
to
live
with
him
there
is
a
single
document
really
to
show
who
she
is
who
her
father
was
or
anything
about
her
family
is
that
very
important
asked
viner
it
decidedly
odd
said
pawle
this
affair
seems
to
be
getting
more
mysterious
than
ever
what
to
be
done
next
inquired
viner
well
the
newspapers
are
always
very
good
about
that
answered
the
solicitor
i
getting
them
to
insert
paragraphs
asking
the
two
men
fosdick
and
stephens
to
come
forward
and
tell
us
if
they
seen
anything
of
ashton
since
he
came
to
england
i
also
asking
if
anybody
can
tell
us
where
ashton
was
when
he
went
away
from
home
on
that
visit
that
killenhall
spoke
of
if
just
then
a
clerk
came
into
pawle
room
and
bending
down
to
him
whispered
a
few
words
which
evidently
occasioned
him
great
surprise
at
once
he
said
bring
them
straight
in
parkinson
god
bless
me
he
exclaimed
turning
to
viner
here
are
the
two
men
in
question
fosdick
and
stephens
saw
our
name
in
the
paper
as
ashton
solicitors
and
want
to
see
me
urgently
chapter
vii
what
was
the
secret
the
two
men
who
were
presently
ushered
in
were
typical
colonials
big
hefty
fellows
as
yet
in
early
middle
age
alert
evidently
prosperous
if
their
attire
and
appointments
were
anything
to
go
by
and
each
was
obviously
deeply
interested
in
the
occasion
of
his
visit
to
pawle
two
pairs
of
quick
eyes
took
in
the
old
solicitor
and
his
companion
and
the
elder
of
the
men
came
forward
in
a
businesslike
manner
pawle
i
understand
he
said
i
fosdick
of
melbourne
victoria
this
is
my
friend
stephens
same
place
take
a
seat
fosdick
have
this
chair
stephens
responded
pawle
you
wish
to
see
me
on
business
that
so
answered
fosdick
as
the
two
men
seated
themselves
by
the
solicitor
desk
we
saw
your
name
in
the
newspapers
this
morning
in
connection
with
the
murder
of
john
ashton
now
we
knew
john
ashton
he
was
a
melbourne
man
too
and
we
can
tell
something
about
him
so
we
came
to
you
instead
of
the
police
because
pawle
what
we
can
tell
is
maybe
more
a
matter
for
a
lawyer
than
for
a
policeman
it
mysterious
gentlemen
said
pawle
i
be
frank
with
you
i
recognized
your
names
as
soon
as
my
clerk
announced
them
here
a
cablegram
which
i
have
just
received
from
melbourne
you
see
your
names
mentioned
in
it
the
two
callers
bent
over
the
cablegram
and
fosdick
looked
up
and
nodded
yes
that
right
he
said
we
came
over
with
john
ashton
in
the
we
knew
him
pretty
well
before
that
most
folk
in
melbourne
did
but
of
course
we
were
thrown
into
his
company
on
board
ship
rather
more
than
we
ever
been
before
and
we
very
much
regret
to
hear
of
what
happened
to
him
you
say
there
is
something
you
can
tell
observed
pawle
if
anything
that
will
help
to
solve
the
mystery
of
this
murder
for
there
is
a
mystery
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
hear
it
fosdick
and
stephens
glanced
at
each
other
and
then
at
viner
who
sat
a
little
in
pawle
rear
partner
of
yours
asked
fosdick
not
at
all
this
gentleman
replied
pawle
is
viner
it
was
he
who
found
ashton
dead
body
they
were
neighbours
well
you
found
the
body
of
a
very
worthy
man
sir
remarked
fosdick
gravely
and
we
like
to
do
something
toward
finding
the
man
who
killed
him
for
we
do
think
it
was
this
young
fellow
who
charged
with
it
nor
that
robbery
was
the
motive
we
think
john
ashton
was
removed
put
out
of
the
way
why
now
asked
pawle
i
tell
you
replied
fosdick
my
friend
stephens
here
is
a
man
of
few
words
he
credits
me
with
more
talkativeness
than
he
lay
claim
to
so
i
to
tell
the
tale
there
may
be
much
in
it
and
there
may
be
a
lot
we
think
there
a
big
lot
but
this
is
what
it
comes
to
ashton
was
a
close
man
a
reserved
man
however
one
night
when
the
three
of
us
were
having
a
quiet
cigar
in
a
corner
of
the
smoking
saloon
in
the
he
opened
out
to
us
a
bit
we
been
talking
about
getting
over
to
england
we
all
three
emigrated
you
understand
when
we
were
very
young
and
the
talk
ran
on
what
we
do
fosdick
and
stephens
d
see
were
only
on
a
visit
which
is
just
coming
to
an
end
pawle
we
sail
home
in
a
day
or
two
but
ashton
was
turning
home
for
good
and
he
said
to
us
in
a
sort
of
burst
of
confidence
that
he
have
plenty
to
do
when
he
landed
he
said
that
he
was
in
possession
sole
possession
of
a
most
extraordinary
secret
the
revelation
of
which
would
affect
one
of
the
first
families
in
england
and
he
was
going
to
bring
it
out
as
soon
as
he
got
settled
down
in
london
well
you
may
be
surprised
but
that
all
all
you
can
tell
exclaimed
pawle
all
but
we
can
see
plenty
in
it
said
fosdick
our
notion
is
that
ashton
was
murdered
by
somebody
who
did
want
that
secret
to
come
out
now
you
see
if
events
do
prove
we
right
gentlemen
said
pawle
allow
me
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
many
as
you
please
sir
assented
fosdick
we
answer
anything
he
did
tell
you
what
the
secret
was
asked
pawle
no
he
said
we
know
more
about
it
in
time
replied
fosdick
it
would
possibly
lead
to
legal
proceedings
he
said
in
that
case
it
would
be
one
of
the
most
celebrated
cases
ever
known
and
romantic
added
stephens
speaking
for
the
first
time
romantic
that
was
the
term
he
used
and
romantic
quite
so
assented
fosdick
celebrated
and
romantic
those
were
the
words
but
in
any
case
he
said
whether
it
got
to
law
matters
or
not
it
could
fail
to
be
in
the
papers
and
we
should
read
all
about
it
in
due
time
and
you
know
no
more
than
that
inquired
pawle
nothing
said
fosdick
with
decision
pawle
looked
at
viner
as
if
to
seek
some
inspiration
and
viner
took
up
the
work
of
examination
do
you
know
anything
of
ashton
movements
since
he
came
to
london
he
asked
next
to
nothing
replied
fosdick
ashton
left
the
at
naples
and
came
overland
he
wanted
to
put
in
a
day
or
two
in
rome
and
a
day
or
two
in
paris
we
came
round
by
sea
to
tilbury
then
stephens
and
i
separated
he
went
to
see
his
people
in
scotland
and
i
went
to
mine
in
lancashire
we
met
stephens
and
i
in
london
here
last
week
and
we
saw
ashton
for
just
a
few
minutes
down
in
the
city
ah
exclaimed
pawle
you
have
seen
him
then
did
anything
happen
you
mean
relating
to
what
he
told
said
fosdick
well
no
more
than
i
asked
him
sort
of
jokingly
how
the
secret
was
and
he
said
it
was
just
about
to
come
out
and
we
must
watch
the
papers
there
was
a
remark
he
made
observed
stephens
he
said
it
would
be
of
just
as
much
interest
perhaps
of
far
more
to
our
colonial
papers
as
to
the
english
yes
he
said
that
agreed
fosdick
he
knew
you
see
that
we
were
just
about
setting
off
home
he
did
ask
you
to
his
house
inquired
pawle
that
was
mentioned
but
we
could
fix
dates
replied
fosdick
however
we
told
him
we
were
both
coming
over
again
on
business
next
year
and
we
come
and
see
him
then
pawle
spread
out
his
hands
with
a
gesture
of
helplessness
we
as
wise
as
ever
he
exclaimed
no
said
fosdick
emphatically
wiser
the
man
had
a
secret
affecting
powerful
interests
many
a
man
been
put
away
for
having
a
secret
pawle
put
his
together
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
his
elder
visitor
well
there
a
good
deal
in
that
he
said
at
last
now
while
here
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
something
else
about
ashton
how
long
have
you
known
him
ever
since
we
were
lads
answered
fosdick
readily
he
was
a
grown
man
then
though
stephens
and
i
are
about
forty
ashton
was
sixty
you
always
known
of
him
as
a
townsman
of
melbourne
that
so
we
were
taken
out
there
when
we
were
about
ten
or
twelve
ashton
lived
near
where
we
settled
down
he
was
a
speculator
in
property
made
his
money
in
buying
and
selling
lots
was
he
well
known
everybody
knew
ashton
did
you
ever
know
of
his
having
a
friend
named
wickham
inquired
pawle
with
a
at
viner
think
carefully
now
but
fosdick
shook
his
head
and
stephens
shook
his
never
heard
the
name
said
fosdick
did
you
ever
hear
ashton
mention
the
name
asked
pawle
never
never
heard
him
mention
it
on
board
ship
when
he
was
coming
home
no
never
well
said
pawle
i
happen
to
know
that
ashton
some
years
ago
had
a
very
particular
friend
named
wickham
out
in
australia
a
sudden
light
came
into
fosdick
keen
eyes
ah
he
said
i
can
tell
how
that
may
be
a
good
many
years
ago
when
we
were
just
familiar
enough
with
melbourne
to
know
certain
people
in
it
i
remember
that
ashton
was
away
up
country
for
some
time
as
that
cablegram
says
most
likely
he
knew
this
wickham
then
is
that
the
wickham
mentioned
there
it
is
assented
pawle
and
i
want
to
know
who
he
was
glad
to
set
any
inquiries
going
for
you
when
we
get
back
said
fosdick
we
sail
in
two
days
gentlemen
answered
pawle
gravely
it
takes
i
believe
five
or
six
weeks
to
reach
australia
by
the
time
you
get
there
this
unfortunate
fellow
hyde
who
charged
with
the
murder
of
ashton
on
evidence
that
is
quite
sufficient
to
satisfy
an
average
british
jury
will
probably
have
been
tried
convicted
and
hanged
no
i
afraid
we
must
act
at
once
if
we
to
help
him
as
viner
here
is
very
anxious
to
do
and
something
you
can
do
the
coroner
inquest
is
to
be
held
tomorrow
go
there
and
volunteer
the
evidence
you
just
told
us
it
may
do
a
scrap
of
good
but
it
will
introduce
an
element
of
doubt
into
the
case
against
hyde
and
that
will
benefit
him
tomorrow
said
fosdick
we
do
it
give
us
the
time
and
place
be
there
pawle
i
see
your
point
sir
to
introduce
the
idea
that
there
more
to
this
than
the
police
think
when
the
two
callers
had
gone
pawle
turned
to
viner
now
my
friend
he
said
you
already
sent
your
own
solicitor
to
hyde
have
you
who
is
he
by
the
by
felpham
of
chancery
lane
replied
viner
excellent
man
now
said
pawle
you
go
to
felpham
and
tell
him
what
these
two
australians
have
just
told
us
and
say
that
in
my
opinion
it
will
be
well
worth
while
in
his
client
interest
to
develop
their
evidence
for
all
it
worth
that
theory
of
fosdick
may
have
a
great
deal
in
it
and
another
thing
felpham
must
insist
on
hyde
being
present
at
the
inquest
tomorrow
and
giving
evidence
that
i
say
must
be
done
hyde
must
make
his
story
public
as
soon
as
possible
he
must
be
brought
to
the
inquest
he
be
warned
by
the
coroner
of
course
that
he
not
bound
to
give
any
evidence
at
all
but
he
must
go
into
the
box
and
tell
on
oath
all
that
he
told
you
and
drillford
now
be
off
to
felpham
and
insist
on
all
this
being
done
viner
went
away
to
chancery
lane
more
puzzled
than
ever
what
was
this
secret
affecting
one
of
the
first
families
in
england
of
which
ashton
had
told
his
two
melbourne
friends
how
was
it
if
legal
proceedings
were
likely
to
arise
out
of
it
that
ashton
had
not
told
pawle
about
it
was
it
possible
that
he
had
gone
to
some
other
solicitor
if
so
why
he
come
forward
and
what
too
was
this
mystery
about
miss
wickham
and
her
father
why
as
pawle
had
remarked
were
there
no
papers
or
documents
concerning
her
to
be
found
anywhere
had
she
anything
to
do
with
the
secret
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
confusion
was
becoming
more
confounded
but
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
save
hyde
and
he
was
relieved
to
see
that
felpham
jumped
at
pawle
suggestion
good
said
felpham
of
course
i
have
hyde
brought
up
at
the
inquest
and
he
shall
tell
his
story
and
we
save
these
australian
chaps
until
hyde
been
in
the
box
i
do
wish
hyde
himself
could
tell
us
more
about
that
man
whom
he
saw
leaving
the
passage
of
course
that
man
is
the
actual
murderer
you
think
that
asked
viner
do
doubt
it
for
one
moment
and
a
cool
calculating
hand
too
declared
felpham
a
man
who
knew
what
he
was
doing
how
long
do
you
suppose
it
would
take
to
strike
the
life
out
of
a
man
and
to
snatch
a
few
valuables
from
his
clothing
pooh
to
a
hand
such
as
this
evidently
was
a
minute
then
he
walks
calmly
away
and
who
is
he
but
we
not
doing
badly
that
too
was
viner
impression
when
he
walked
out
of
the
court
next
day
after
having
endured
its
close
and
sordid
atmosphere
for
four
long
hours
he
felt
more
from
intuition
than
from
anything
tangible
that
things
had
gone
well
for
hyde
one
fact
was
plain
nothing
more
could
be
brought
out
against
hyde
either
there
when
the
inquest
was
resumed
a
week
later
or
before
the
magistrate
or
before
a
judge
and
jury
every
scrap
of
evidence
against
him
was
produced
before
the
coroner
it
was
obvious
that
the
police
could
rake
up
no
more
unless
indeed
they
could
prove
him
to
have
hidden
ashton
remaining
valuables
somewhere
which
was
ostensibly
an
impossibility
and
the
evidence
of
hyde
himself
had
impressed
the
court
two
days
rest
and
refreshment
even
in
a
prison
and
on
prison
fare
had
pulled
him
together
and
he
had
given
his
evidence
clearly
and
confidently
viner
had
seen
that
people
were
impressed
by
it
they
had
been
impressed
too
by
the
evidence
volunteered
by
the
two
australians
and
when
the
coroner
announced
that
he
should
adjourn
the
inquiry
for
a
week
the
folk
who
had
crowded
the
court
went
away
asking
each
other
not
if
hyde
was
guilty
but
what
was
this
secret
of
which
ashton
had
boasted
the
possession
drillford
caught
viner
up
as
he
walked
down
the
street
and
smiled
grimly
at
him
well
you
doing
your
best
for
him
and
no
mistake
viner
he
said
he
a
lucky
chap
to
have
found
such
a
friend
he
as
innocent
as
i
am
answered
viner
look
here
if
you
police
want
to
do
justice
why
do
you
try
to
track
the
man
whom
hyde
has
told
of
what
clue
have
we
exclaimed
drillford
almost
contemptuously
a
tall
man
in
black
clothes
muffled
to
his
eyes
but
i
tell
you
what
viner
he
added
with
a
grin
as
you
so
confident
why
do
you
find
him
perhaps
i
shall
said
viner
quietly
he
meant
what
he
said
and
he
was
thinking
deeply
what
might
be
done
towards
accomplishing
his
desires
when
later
in
the
afternoon
pawle
rang
him
up
on
the
telephone
run
down
said
pawle
cheerily
there
a
new
development
chapter
viii
news
from
arcadia
when
viner
half
an
hour
later
walked
into
the
at
crawle
pawle
and
rattenbury
he
was
aware
of
a
modestly
attired
young
woman
evidently
from
her
dress
and
appearance
a
country
girl
who
sat
shyly
turning
over
the
pages
of
an
illustrated
paper
and
as
soon
as
he
got
into
pawle
private
room
the
old
solicitor
jerked
his
thumb
at
the
door
by
which
viner
had
entered
and
smiled
significantly
see
that
girl
outside
he
asked
she
the
reason
of
my
ringing
you
up
yes
said
viner
but
what
why
more
mystery
do
know
said
pawle
i
kept
her
story
till
you
came
she
turned
up
here
about
of
an
hour
ago
and
said
that
her
grandmother
who
keeps
an
inn
at
marketstoke
in
buckinghamshire
had
seen
the
paragraph
in
the
papers
this
morning
in
which
i
asked
if
anybody
could
give
any
information
about
john
ashton
movements
and
had
immediately
sent
her
off
to
me
with
the
message
that
a
gentleman
of
that
name
stayed
at
their
house
for
a
few
days
some
weeks
since
and
that
if
i
would
send
somebody
over
there
she
the
grandmother
could
give
some
particulars
about
him
so
that
solves
the
question
we
were
talking
of
at
markendale
square
as
to
where
ashton
went
during
the
absence
killenhall
told
us
of
if
this
is
the
same
ashton
suggested
viner
we
soon
decide
that
answered
pawle
as
he
touched
the
bell
on
his
desk
i
purposely
awaited
your
coming
before
hearing
what
this
young
woman
had
to
tell
now
my
dear
he
continued
as
a
clerk
brought
the
girl
into
the
room
take
a
chair
and
tell
me
what
your
message
is
more
particularly
you
from
marketstoke
eh
just
so
and
your
grandmother
who
sent
you
here
keeps
an
inn
there
yes
sir
the
ellingham
arms
replied
the
girl
as
she
sat
down
and
glanced
a
little
nervously
at
her
two
interviewers
to
be
sure
and
your
grandmother
name
is
what
hannah
summers
sir
hannah
summers
grandfather
living
no
sir
very
well
hannah
summers
landlady
at
the
ellingham
arms
marketstoke
in
buckinghamshire
now
then
but
what
your
name
my
dear
lucy
summers
sir
very
pretty
name
i
sure
well
and
what
the
message
your
grandmother
sent
me
i
want
this
gentleman
to
hear
it
grandmother
wished
me
to
say
sir
that
we
read
the
piece
in
the
paper
this
morning
asking
if
anybody
could
give
you
any
news
about
a
john
ashton
and
that
as
we
had
a
gentleman
of
that
name
staying
with
us
for
three
or
four
days
some
weeks
since
she
sent
me
to
tell
you
and
to
say
that
if
you
would
send
somebody
down
to
see
her
she
could
give
some
information
about
him
very
clearly
put
my
dear
much
obliged
to
you
said
pawle
now
i
suppose
you
were
at
the
ellingham
arms
when
this
ashton
came
there
oh
yes
sir
i
live
there
to
be
sure
now
what
sort
of
man
was
he
in
appearance
a
tall
big
gentleman
sir
with
a
beard
going
a
little
grey
he
was
wearing
a
blue
serge
suit
pawle
nodded
at
viner
seems
like
our
man
he
remarked
now
he
went
on
turning
again
to
lucy
summers
you
say
he
stayed
there
three
or
four
days
what
did
he
do
with
himself
while
he
was
there
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
time
about
the
church
sir
answered
the
girl
and
he
was
at
ellingham
park
a
good
deal
whose
place
is
that
interrupted
pawle
lord
ellingham
sir
do
you
mean
that
ashton
called
on
lord
ellingham
or
what
no
sir
because
lord
ellingham
was
there
he
scarcely
ever
is
there
replied
lucy
summers
i
mean
that
ashton
went
into
the
park
a
good
deal
and
looked
over
the
house
a
good
many
people
come
to
see
ellingham
park
sir
well
and
what
else
asked
pawle
did
he
go
to
see
people
in
the
town
at
all
i
do
know
sir
but
he
was
out
most
of
the
day
and
at
night
he
talked
a
great
deal
with
my
grandmother
in
her
i
think
added
the
girl
with
a
glance
which
took
in
both
listeners
i
think
that
what
she
wants
to
tell
about
she
would
have
come
here
herself
but
she
over
seventy
and
does
like
travelling
pawle
turned
to
viner
now
we
know
where
we
are
he
said
there
no
doubt
that
this
is
our
ashton
and
that
summers
has
something
she
can
tell
about
him
viner
i
suggest
that
you
and
i
go
down
to
marketstoke
this
afternoon
you
accommodations
for
a
couple
of
gentlemen
i
suppose
my
dear
he
added
turning
to
the
girl
couple
of
nice
bedrooms
and
a
bit
of
dinner
eh
oh
yes
sir
replied
lucy
summers
we
constantly
have
gentlemen
there
sir
very
well
said
pawle
now
then
you
run
away
home
to
marketstoke
my
dear
and
tell
your
grandmother
that
i
very
much
obliged
to
her
and
that
i
am
coming
down
this
evening
with
this
gentleman
viner
and
that
we
shall
be
obliged
if
she
have
a
nice
plain
dinner
ready
for
us
at
seven
we
shall
come
in
my
motorcar
you
can
put
that
up
for
the
night
and
my
driver
too
very
well
that
settled
now
come
along
and
one
of
my
clerks
shall
get
you
a
cab
to
your
station
great
central
is
it
all
right
mind
you
get
yourself
a
cup
of
tea
before
going
home
viner
pawle
continued
when
he
had
taken
the
girl
into
the
outer
office
we
can
easily
run
down
to
marketstoke
in
under
two
hours
call
for
you
at
your
house
at
five
that
give
us
time
to
wash
away
the
dirt
before
our
dinner
and
then
we
hear
what
this
old
lady
has
to
tell
viner
who
was
musing
somewhat
vaguely
over
these
curious
developments
looked
at
pawle
as
if
in
speculation
about
his
evident
optimism
you
think
we
shall
hear
something
worth
hearing
he
asked
i
should
say
we
probably
shall
replied
pawle
put
things
together
ashton
goes
away
as
soon
as
he
got
settled
down
in
markendale
square
on
a
somewhat
mysterious
journey
now
we
hear
that
he
had
a
secret
perhaps
something
relating
to
that
secret
is
mixed
up
with
his
visit
to
marketstoke
depend
upon
it
an
old
woman
of
over
seventy
especially
a
landlady
of
a
inn
whose
wits
are
presumably
pretty
sharp
would
send
for
me
unless
she
something
to
tell
before
midnight
my
dear
sir
we
may
have
learnt
a
good
deal
viner
picked
up
his
hat
i
be
ready
for
you
at
five
he
said
then
halfway
to
the
door
he
turned
with
a
question
by
the
by
he
added
you
like
me
to
tell
the
two
ladies
that
we
found
out
where
ashton
went
when
he
was
away
i
think
not
until
we
found
out
why
he
went
away
answered
the
old
lawyer
with
a
significant
smile
we
may
draw
the
covert
blank
you
know
after
all
when
we
some
definite
news
viner
nodded
went
out
into
the
afternoon
calm
of
bedford
row
as
he
walked
up
it
staring
mechanically
at
the
red
brick
fronts
he
wondered
how
many
curious
secrets
had
been
talked
over
and
perhaps
unravelled
in
the
numerous
legal
sanctuaries
approached
through
those
open
doorways
were
there
often
as
strange
ones
as
that
upon
which
he
had
so
unexpectedly
stumbled
and
when
they
first
came
into
the
arena
of
thought
and
speculation
did
they
arouse
as
much
perplexity
and
mental
exercise
as
was
now
being
set
up
in
him
did
every
secret
too
possibly
endanger
a
man
life
as
his
old
schoolfellow
was
being
endangered
he
had
no
particular
affection
or
friendship
for
langton
hyde
of
whom
indeed
he
had
known
very
little
at
school
but
he
had
an
absolute
conviction
that
he
was
innocent
of
murder
and
that
conviction
had
already
aroused
in
him
a
passionate
determination
to
outwit
the
police
he
had
been
quick
to
see
through
drillford
plans
there
was
a
case
a
strong
case
against
hyde
and
the
police
would
work
it
up
for
all
they
were
worth
failing
proofs
in
other
directions
failing
the
discovery
of
the
real
murderer
how
was
that
case
going
to
be
upset
and
was
it
likely
that
he
and
pawle
were
going
to
find
any
really
important
evidence
in
an
obscure
buckinghamshire
he
jumped
into
a
cab
at
the
top
of
bedford
row
and
hastened
back
to
markendale
square
to
pack
a
bag
and
prepare
for
his
journey
miss
penkridge
called
to
him
from
the
as
he
was
running
upstairs
he
turned
into
the
room
to
find
her
in
company
with
two
ladies
dismal
pathetic
figures
in
very
plain
and
obviously
countrified
garments
both
in
tears
and
evident
great
distress
who
as
viner
walked
in
rose
from
their
chairs
and
gazed
at
him
sadly
and
wistfully
they
reminded
him
at
once
of
the
type
of
spinster
found
in
quiet
unpretentious
cottages
in
villages
the
neither
young
nor
old
women
who
live
on
circumscribed
means
and
are
painfully
shy
of
the
rude
world
outside
and
before
either
he
or
miss
penkridge
could
speak
the
elder
of
the
two
broke
into
an
eager
exclamation
oh
viner
we
are
langton
sisters
and
we
are
so
grateful
to
you
and
oh
do
you
think
you
can
save
him
viner
was
quick
to
seize
the
situation
he
said
a
soothing
word
or
two
begged
his
visitors
to
sit
down
again
and
whispered
to
miss
penkridge
to
ring
for
tea
you
have
come
to
town
today
he
asked
we
left
home
very
very
early
this
morning
replied
the
elder
sister
we
learned
this
dreadful
news
last
night
in
the
evening
paper
we
came
away
at
four
this
morning
we
live
in
durham
viner
and
we
have
been
to
felpham
office
this
afternoon
he
told
us
how
kind
you
had
been
in
engaging
his
services
for
our
unfortunate
brother
and
we
came
to
thank
you
but
oh
do
you
think
there
is
any
chance
for
him
every
chance
declared
viner
pretending
more
conviction
than
he
felt
do
let
yourselves
be
cast
down
we
move
heaven
and
earth
to
prove
that
he
wrongly
accused
i
gather
if
you
do
mind
my
asking
that
your
brother
has
been
out
of
touch
with
you
for
some
time
the
two
sisters
exchanged
mournful
glances
we
had
not
heard
anything
of
langton
for
some
years
replied
the
elder
he
is
much
much
younger
than
ourselves
and
perhaps
we
are
too
staid
and
for
him
but
if
we
had
known
that
he
was
in
want
oh
dear
me
we
are
not
at
all
viner
but
we
would
have
sacrificed
anything
felpham
says
that
we
shall
be
allowed
to
visit
him
he
is
going
to
arrange
for
us
to
do
so
and
of
course
we
must
remain
in
london
until
this
terrible
business
is
over
we
came
prepared
for
that
prepared
for
that
repeated
the
other
sister
who
seemed
to
be
a
fainter
replica
of
the
elder
yes
prepared
of
course
mr
viner
now
that
we
have
found
langton
though
in
such
painful
circumstances
said
the
first
speaker
we
must
stand
by
him
we
must
find
some
quiet
lodging
and
settle
down
to
help
we
can
not
let
all
the
burden
fall
on
you
mr
viner
viner
glanced
at
miss
penkridge
they
were
quick
to
understand
each
other
these
two
and
he
knew
at
once
that
miss
penkridge
saw
what
was
in
his
mind
you
must
stay
with
us
he
said
turning
to
the
two
mournful
figures
we
have
any
amount
of
room
in
this
house
and
we
shall
be
only
too
glad
oh
but
that
is
too
began
both
ladies
i
insist
said
viner
with
a
smile
we
both
insist
echoed
miss
penkridge
we
are
both
given
to
having
our
own
way
too
so
say
no
more
about
it
we
are
all
in
the
same
boat
just
now
and
its
name
is
and
we
must
pull
together
until
we
in
harbour
listen
said
viner
i
have
to
go
away
tonight
on
a
matter
closely
connected
with
this
affair
let
me
leave
you
in
my
aunt
charge
and
tomorrow
i
may
be
able
to
give
you
some
cheering
news
you
be
much
more
comfortable
here
than
in
any
lodgings
or
hotel
and
and
i
should
like
to
do
something
for
hyde
we
old
schoolfellows
you
know
then
he
escaped
from
the
room
and
made
ready
for
his
journey
and
at
five
came
pawle
in
his
private
car
and
carried
him
off
into
the
dark
and
hour
and
a
half
later
the
car
rolled
smoothly
into
the
main
street
of
a
quiet
wholly
arcadian
little
town
and
pulled
up
before
an
house
over
the
door
of
which
was
set
up
one
of
those
ancient
signs
which
in
such
places
display
the
coat
of
arms
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
viner
had
just
time
to
glance
around
him
and
in
a
clear
starlit
evening
to
see
the
high
tower
of
a
church
the
timbered
fronts
of
old
houses
and
many
a
tall
venerable
tree
before
following
pawle
into
a
stone
hall
filled
with
dark
oak
cabinets
and
bright
with
old
brass
and
pewter
on
the
open
hearth
of
which
burnt
a
fine
and
cheery
fire
of
logs
excellent
muttered
the
old
lawyer
as
he
began
to
take
off
his
multitudinous
wraps
a
real
bit
of
the
real
old
england
viner
if
the
dinner
is
as
good
as
this
promises
i
shall
be
glad
we
come
whatever
the
occasion
here
the
landlady
i
suppose
said
viner
as
a
door
opened
a
tall
old
woman
surprisingly
active
and
vivacious
in
spite
of
her
evident
age
came
forward
with
a
polite
bow
she
wore
a
silk
gown
and
a
silk
apron
and
a
smart
cap
and
her
still
bright
eyes
took
in
the
two
visitors
at
a
glance
your
servant
gentlemen
she
said
your
rooms
are
ready
and
dinner
will
be
ready
too
when
you
are
this
way
if
you
please
a
very
fine
old
house
this
observed
pawle
as
they
followed
her
up
a
curious
staircase
all
nooks
and
corners
and
you
have
no
doubt
been
long
in
it
born
in
it
sir
said
the
landlady
with
a
laugh
our
family
on
one
side
has
been
here
two
hundred
years
this
is
your
room
sir
this
is
your
friend
she
paused
and
with
a
significant
look
pointed
to
another
door
that
she
said
is
the
room
which
ashton
had
when
he
was
here
ah
we
are
very
anxious
to
know
what
you
can
tell
us
about
him
said
pawle
summers
paused
and
again
glanced
significantly
at
her
visitors
i
wish
i
knew
the
meaning
of
what
i
shall
tell
you
she
answered
chapter
ix
looking
backward
on
the
principle
that
business
should
never
be
discussed
when
one
is
dining
pawle
made
no
reference
during
dinner
to
the
matter
which
had
brought
viner
and
himself
to
the
ellingham
arms
he
devoted
all
his
attention
and
energies
to
the
pleasures
of
the
table
he
praised
the
grilled
soles
and
roast
mutton
and
grew
enthusiastic
over
some
old
burgundy
which
summers
strongly
recommended
but
when
dinner
was
over
and
he
had
drunk
a
glass
or
two
of
old
port
his
eyes
began
to
turn
toward
the
door
of
the
quaint
little
parlour
in
which
he
and
viner
had
been
installed
and
to
which
the
landlady
had
promised
to
come
i
confess
i
unusually
curious
about
what
we
going
to
hear
viner
he
said
as
he
drew
out
a
there
an
atmosphere
of
mystery
about
our
presence
and
our
surroundings
that
like
an
apéritif
to
an
already
hungry
man
ashton
poor
fellow
comes
over
to
this
quiet
place
why
we
do
know
what
he
does
here
we
do
know
yet
but
all
the
circumstances
up
to
now
seem
to
point
to
secrecy
if
not
to
absolute
romance
and
adventure
is
it
going
after
all
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
his
death
asked
viner
that
what
concerns
me
i
afraid
i
a
bit
indifferent
to
the
rest
of
it
what
particular
romance
do
you
think
could
be
attached
to
the
mere
fact
that
ashton
paid
a
three
days
visit
to
marketstoke
pawle
drew
out
a
in
my
profession
he
answered
we
hear
a
great
deal
more
of
romance
than
most
folk
could
imagine
now
here
a
man
who
returns
to
this
country
from
a
long
residence
in
australia
the
first
thing
he
does
after
getting
settled
down
in
london
is
to
visit
marketstoke
why
marketstoke
marketstoke
is
an
obscure
place
there
are
at
least
five
or
six
towns
in
this
very
county
that
are
better
known
again
i
say
why
marketstoke
and
why
this
the
very
first
place
in
england
for
what
reason
now
as
a
lawyer
a
reason
does
suggest
itself
to
me
i
been
thinking
about
it
ever
since
that
lass
called
at
my
office
this
afternoon
what
does
the
man
who
been
away
from
his
native
land
for
the
best
part
of
his
life
do
as
a
rule
when
at
last
he
sets
foot
on
it
again
eh
i
not
greatly
experienced
replied
viner
smiling
at
the
old
solicitor
professional
enthusiasm
what
does
he
do
usually
makes
his
way
as
soon
as
possible
to
his
native
place
exclaimed
pawle
with
an
expressive
flourish
of
his
cigar
that
usually
is
the
first
thing
he
thinks
of
you
not
old
enough
to
remember
the
circumstances
my
boy
but
i
have
of
course
a
very
distinct
recollection
of
the
tichborne
affair
in
the
early
seventies
now
if
you
ever
read
the
evidence
in
that
you
remember
that
the
claimant
orton
on
arriving
in
england
posing
as
the
missing
heir
sir
roger
tichborne
did
a
certain
thing
the
evidence
of
which
i
can
assure
you
was
not
lost
on
the
jury
before
whom
he
eventually
came
instead
of
going
direct
to
tichborne
where
you
naturally
have
thought
all
his
affection
and
interests
rested
where
did
he
go
to
whitechapel
why
because
the
ortons
were
whitechapel
folk
the
native
place
called
him
do
you
see
the
first
thought
he
had
on
setting
foot
on
english
soil
was
whitechapel
are
you
suggesting
that
ashton
was
probably
a
native
of
marketstoke
asked
viner
i
mean
to
find
out
no
matter
what
we
hear
from
the
landlady
if
that
name
is
to
be
found
in
the
parish
register
here
anyway
answered
pawle
you
can
be
sure
of
this
ashton
came
to
this
obscure
country
town
for
some
special
purpose
what
was
it
and
had
it
anything
to
do
with
did
it
lead
up
to
his
murder
that
a
light
tap
at
the
door
heralded
the
approach
of
summers
that
repeated
pawle
as
he
jumped
up
from
his
chair
and
politely
threw
the
door
open
is
what
i
mean
to
endeavour
endeavour
at
any
rate
to
discover
come
in
he
continued
gallantly
motioning
the
old
landlady
to
the
easiest
chair
in
the
room
we
are
very
eager
indeed
to
hear
what
you
can
tell
us
our
cigars
now
pray
do
mention
them
sir
responded
summers
i
hope
you
are
quite
comfortable
and
that
you
are
having
everything
you
wish
nothing
could
be
more
pleasant
and
gratifying
as
far
as
material
comfort
goes
answered
pawle
with
conviction
the
dinner
was
excellent
your
wine
is
sound
this
old
room
is
a
veritable
haven
i
wish
we
were
visiting
you
under
less
sad
conditions
and
now
about
your
recollections
of
this
poor
gentleman
the
landlady
laid
a
large
book
on
the
table
and
opening
it
at
a
page
where
at
she
had
placed
a
marker
pointed
to
a
signature
that
is
the
writing
of
the
john
ashton
who
came
here
she
said
he
registered
his
name
and
address
the
day
he
came
there
it
is
ashton
markendale
square
london
you
gentlemen
will
recognise
it
perhaps
pawle
put
up
his
glasses
glanced
once
at
the
open
book
and
turned
to
viner
with
a
confirmatory
nod
that
ashton
writing
without
a
doubt
he
said
it
a
signature
not
to
be
forgotten
when
you
once
seen
it
well
that
establishes
the
fact
that
he
undoubtedly
came
here
on
that
date
now
what
can
you
tell
about
him
summers
took
the
chair
which
viner
drew
forward
to
the
hearth
and
folded
her
hands
over
her
silk
apron
well
sir
she
answered
a
good
deal
ashton
came
here
one
monday
afternoon
in
a
motorcar
with
his
luggage
and
asked
if
i
could
give
him
rooms
and
accommodation
for
a
few
days
of
course
i
could
he
had
this
room
and
the
room
i
pointed
out
upstairs
and
he
stayed
here
until
the
thursday
when
he
left
soon
after
lunch
the
same
car
came
for
him
and
he
had
been
in
the
house
an
hour
gentlemen
before
i
wondered
if
he
had
been
here
before
interesting
very
said
pawle
now
why
did
you
wonder
that
well
sir
replied
summers
because
after
he
looked
round
the
house
and
seen
his
room
upstairs
he
went
out
to
the
front
door
and
then
i
followed
him
to
ask
if
he
had
any
particular
wishes
about
his
dinner
that
evening
our
front
door
as
you
will
see
in
the
morning
fronts
the
market
square
and
from
it
you
can
see
about
all
there
is
to
see
of
the
town
he
was
standing
at
the
door
under
the
porch
looking
all
round
him
and
i
overheard
him
talking
to
himself
as
i
went
up
behind
him
he
was
saying
as
he
looked
this
way
and
that
the
old
church
and
the
old
and
the
old
and
the
old
gabled
and
thatched
houses
and
even
the
old
town
pump
they
changed
a
bit
i
reckon
in
all
these
years
then
he
caught
sight
of
me
and
he
smiled
many
changes
in
this
old
place
landlady
in
your
time
he
said
pleasantly
sir
i
answered
do
change
much
in
even
a
hundred
years
in
marketstoke
he
said
and
shook
his
head
the
change
is
in
men
in
men
and
then
he
suddenly
set
straight
off
across
the
square
to
the
churchyard
known
marketstoke
before
i
said
to
myself
you
did
ask
him
that
inquired
pawle
eagerly
i
did
sir
replied
summers
i
never
asked
him
a
question
all
the
time
he
was
here
i
thought
that
if
i
was
correct
in
what
i
fancied
i
should
hear
him
say
something
but
he
never
did
say
anything
of
that
sort
all
the
same
i
felt
more
and
more
certain
that
he
did
know
the
place
and
during
the
time
he
was
here
he
went
about
in
it
in
a
fashion
that
convinced
me
that
my
ideas
were
right
he
was
in
and
around
the
church
a
great
deal
the
vicar
and
the
parish
clerk
can
tell
you
more
about
his
visits
there
than
i
can
and
he
was
at
the
old
several
times
looking
over
certain
old
things
they
keep
there
and
he
visited
ellingham
park
twice
and
was
shown
over
the
house
and
before
he
been
here
two
days
i
came
to
a
certain
conclusion
about
him
and
i
had
it
ever
since
though
he
never
said
one
word
or
did
one
thing
that
could
positively
confirm
me
in
it
yes
exclaimed
pawle
and
that
was
that
he
was
somebody
who
disappeared
from
marketstoke
years
ago
answered
the
landlady
disappeared
completely
and
has
never
been
heard
of
from
that
day
to
this
pawle
turned
slowly
and
looked
at
viner
he
nodded
his
head
several
times
then
turned
to
summers
and
regarded
her
fixedly
and
that
somebody
he
asked
in
hushed
accents
who
was
he
the
landlady
smoothed
her
silk
apron
and
shook
her
head
it
a
long
story
sir
she
answered
i
think
you
must
have
heard
something
of
it
though
to
be
sure
it
was
not
talked
of
much
at
the
time
and
did
become
public
until
legal
proceedings
became
necessary
some
years
ago
you
aware
of
course
that
just
outside
the
town
here
is
ellingham
park
the
seat
of
the
earl
of
ellingham
well
what
i
have
to
tell
you
has
to
do
with
them
and
i
shall
have
to
go
back
a
good
way
years
ago
the
head
of
the
family
was
the
seventh
earl
who
was
then
getting
on
in
life
he
was
a
very
overbearing
harsh
old
gentleman
not
at
all
liked
the
people
here
in
marketstoke
nearly
all
of
them
his
tenants
used
to
be
perpetually
at
variance
with
him
about
something
or
other
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
wanted
to
have
his
own
way
about
everything
and
he
had
trouble
at
home
at
any
rate
with
his
elder
son
he
only
had
two
sons
and
no
daughter
and
about
the
time
talking
of
it
came
to
a
head
nobody
ever
knew
exactly
what
it
was
all
about
but
it
was
well
known
that
lord
marketstoke
that
was
the
elder
son
name
and
his
father
the
earl
were
at
cross
purposes
if
not
actually
at
daggers
drawn
about
something
or
other
and
when
lord
marketstoke
was
about
twenty
five
or
there
was
a
great
quarrel
between
them
it
broke
out
one
night
after
dinner
the
servants
heard
angry
words
between
them
that
night
gentlemen
lord
marketstoke
left
the
house
and
set
off
to
london
and
from
that
day
to
this
he
has
never
been
heard
of
or
seen
again
hereabouts
at
any
rate
pawle
who
was
listening
with
the
deepest
interest
and
attention
glanced
at
viner
as
if
to
entreat
the
same
care
on
his
part
i
do
remember
something
of
this
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
he
said
there
were
some
legal
proceedings
in
connection
with
this
disappearance
i
believe
some
years
ago
yes
sir
they
were
in
the
newspapers
asserted
the
old
landlady
but
of
course
those
of
us
about
here
knew
of
how
things
stood
long
before
that
lord
marketstoke
went
away
as
i
have
said
it
was
known
that
he
had
money
of
his
own
that
had
come
to
him
from
his
mother
who
had
died
years
before
all
this
but
it
was
known
where
he
went
some
said
gone
to
the
colonies
some
said
to
america
and
at
one
time
there
was
a
rumour
that
he
taken
another
name
and
joined
some
foreign
army
and
been
killed
in
its
service
anyway
nobody
ever
heard
a
word
of
him
marcherson
who
was
steward
at
ellingham
park
for
over
forty
years
he
died
last
year
a
very
old
man
assured
me
that
from
the
day
on
which
lord
marketstoke
left
his
father
house
not
one
word
of
him
not
a
breath
ever
reached
any
of
those
he
left
behind
him
there
was
absolute
silence
he
could
have
disappeared
more
completely
if
laid
him
in
the
family
vault
in
marketstoke
church
and
evident
intention
to
disappear
observed
pawle
you
mark
that
viner
it
important
well
he
added
turning
again
to
summers
and
what
happened
next
well
sir
there
was
nothing
much
happened
continued
the
landlady
matters
went
on
in
pretty
much
the
usual
way
the
old
earl
got
older
of
course
and
his
temper
got
worse
marcherson
assured
me
that
he
was
never
known
to
mention
his
missing
son
to
anybody
and
in
the
end
perhaps
about
fifteen
years
after
lord
marketstoke
had
gone
away
he
died
and
then
there
was
no
end
of
trouble
and
bother
the
earl
had
left
no
will
at
any
rate
no
will
could
be
found
and
no
lawyer
could
be
heard
of
who
had
ever
made
one
and
of
course
nobody
knew
where
the
new
earl
was
nor
even
if
he
was
alive
or
dead
there
were
advertisements
sent
out
all
over
the
world
marcherson
told
me
that
they
were
translated
into
i
do
know
how
many
foreign
languages
and
published
in
every
quarter
of
the
globe
asking
for
news
of
him
and
stating
that
his
father
was
dead
that
was
done
for
some
time
with
no
result
asked
pawle
no
result
whatever
sir
i
understand
that
the
family
solicitors
never
had
one
single
reply
answered
summers
i
understand
too
that
for
some
time
before
the
old
earl
death
they
been
trying
to
trace
lord
marketstoke
from
his
last
known
movements
but
that
had
failed
too
he
had
chambers
in
london
and
he
kept
a
manservant
there
the
manservant
could
only
say
that
on
the
night
on
which
his
young
master
left
ellingham
park
he
returned
to
his
chambers
went
to
bed
and
had
gone
when
he
the
manservant
rose
in
the
morning
no
sir
all
the
efforts
and
advertisements
were
no
good
whatever
and
after
some
time
some
considerable
time
the
younger
brother
the
honourable
charles
is
that
the
family
name
interrupted
pawle
that
the
family
name
sir
replied
summers
one
of
the
oldest
families
in
these
parts
sir
the
earldom
dates
from
queen
anne
well
the
honourable
charles
and
his
solicitors
of
course
came
to
the
conclusion
that
lord
marketstoke
was
dead
and
so
i
do
understand
the
legal
niceties
gentlemen
but
they
went
to
the
courts
to
get
something
done
which
presumed
his
death
and
let
charles
come
into
the
title
and
estates
and
in
the
end
that
had
been
done
and
charles
became
the
eighth
earl
of
ellingham
i
remember
it
now
muttered
pawle
yes
curious
case
but
it
was
proved
to
the
court
i
recollect
that
everything
possible
had
been
done
to
find
the
missing
heir
and
without
result
just
so
sir
and
so
charles
succeeded
asserted
summers
he
was
a
very
nice
pleasant
man
not
a
bit
like
his
father
a
very
good
and
considerate
landlord
and
much
respected
but
he
gone
now
died
three
years
ago
and
his
son
a
young
man
of
or
three
succeeded
him
that
the
present
earl
gentlemen
and
of
him
we
see
very
little
he
scarcely
ever
stayed
at
ellingham
park
except
for
a
bit
of
shooting
since
he
came
to
the
title
and
now
she
concluded
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
the
old
lawyer
i
wonder
if
you
see
sir
what
it
was
that
came
into
my
mind
when
this
john
ashton
came
here
a
few
weeks
ago
especially
after
i
heard
him
say
what
he
did
and
after
i
saw
how
he
was
spending
his
time
here
i
no
inkling
i
no
inkling
said
pawle
you
wondered
i
wondered
murmured
summers
bending
closer
to
her
listeners
if
the
man
who
called
himself
john
ashton
was
in
reality
the
lord
marketstoke
chapter
x
the
parish
register
pawle
after
a
glance
at
viner
which
seemed
to
be
full
of
many
meanings
bent
forward
in
his
chair
and
laid
a
hand
on
the
old
landlady
arm
now
have
you
said
as
much
as
that
to
anybody
before
he
asked
eking
her
significantly
have
you
mentioned
it
to
your
neighbours
for
instance
or
to
any
one
in
the
town
no
sir
declared
summers
promptly
not
to
a
soul
i
given
to
keeping
my
ideas
to
myself
especially
on
matters
of
importance
there
is
no
one
here
in
marketstoke
that
i
would
have
mentioned
such
a
thing
to
now
that
the
late
steward
marcherson
is
dead
i
should
have
mentioned
it
to
you
two
gentlemen
if
it
had
been
for
this
dreadful
news
in
the
papers
no
i
kept
my
thoughts
at
home
wise
woman
said
pawle
but
now
let
me
ask
you
a
few
questions
did
you
know
this
lord
marketstoke
before
he
disappeared
i
only
saw
him
two
or
three
times
replied
the
landlady
it
was
seldom
that
he
came
to
ellingham
park
after
his
majority
of
course
i
saw
him
a
good
deal
when
he
was
a
mere
boy
but
after
he
was
grown
up
only
as
i
say
a
very
few
times
but
you
remember
him
suggested
pawle
oh
very
well
indeed
said
summers
i
saw
him
last
a
day
or
two
before
he
went
away
for
good
well
now
did
you
think
you
recognized
anything
of
him
making
allowance
for
the
difference
in
age
in
this
man
who
called
himself
john
ashton
asked
pawle
for
that
of
course
is
important
ashton
answered
summers
was
just
such
a
man
as
lord
marketstoke
might
have
been
expected
to
become
height
build
all
the
that
i
known
were
big
men
colour
were
alike
of
course
ashton
had
a
beard
slightly
grey
but
he
was
a
man
all
the
family
had
crown
hair
the
present
lord
ellingham
is
and
ashton
had
grey
eyes
every
that
i
remember
was
i
should
say
that
ashton
was
just
what
i
should
have
expected
lord
marketstoke
to
be
at
sixty
i
suppose
ashton
never
said
or
did
anything
here
to
reveal
his
secret
if
he
had
one
asked
pawle
after
a
moment
thoughtful
pause
oh
nothing
replied
summers
he
occupied
himself
as
i
tell
you
while
he
was
here
and
finally
he
went
away
in
the
car
in
which
he
had
come
saying
that
he
had
greatly
enjoyed
his
stay
and
that
we
should
see
him
again
sometime
no
he
never
said
anything
about
himself
that
is
but
he
asked
me
several
questions
i
used
to
talk
to
him
sometimes
of
an
evening
about
the
present
lord
ellingham
what
sort
of
questions
inquired
pawle
oh
as
to
what
sort
of
young
man
he
was
and
if
he
was
a
good
landlord
and
so
on
replied
summers
and
i
purposely
told
him
about
the
disappearance
of
years
ago
just
to
see
what
he
would
say
about
it
ah
and
what
did
he
say
asked
pawle
nothing
except
that
it
was
extraordinary
how
people
could
disappear
in
this
world
said
summers
whether
he
was
interested
or
not
he
did
show
it
probably
felt
that
he
knew
more
about
it
than
you
did
chuckled
the
old
solicitor
well
we
much
obliged
to
you
now
take
my
advice
and
keep
to
your
very
excellent
plan
of
saying
nothing
tomorrow
morning
we
will
just
have
a
look
into
certain
things
and
see
if
we
can
discover
anything
really
pertinent
and
you
shall
know
what
conclusion
we
come
to
viner
pawle
went
on
when
the
old
landlady
had
left
them
alone
what
do
you
think
of
this
extraordinary
story
upon
my
word
i
think
it
quite
possible
that
the
old
lady
theory
might
be
right
and
that
ashton
may
really
have
been
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
you
think
it
probable
that
a
man
who
was
heir
to
an
english
earldom
and
to
considerable
estates
could
disappear
like
that
for
so
many
years
and
then
reappear
asked
viner
i
wo
discuss
the
probability
answered
pawle
but
that
possible
i
should
steadily
affirm
i
known
several
very
extraordinary
cases
of
disappearance
in
this
particular
instance
granting
things
to
be
as
summers
suggests
see
how
easy
the
whole
thing
is
this
young
man
disappears
he
goes
to
a
colony
under
an
assumed
name
nobody
knows
him
it
is
ten
thousand
to
one
against
his
being
recognized
by
visitors
from
home
all
the
advertising
in
the
world
will
fail
to
reveal
his
identity
the
only
person
who
knows
who
he
is
is
himself
and
if
he
refuses
to
speak
there
you
are
what
surprises
me
remarked
viner
is
that
a
man
who
evidently
lived
a
new
life
for
years
and
prospered
most
successfully
in
it
should
want
to
return
to
the
old
one
ah
but
you
never
know
said
the
old
lawyer
family
feeling
old
associations
loss
of
the
old
place
eh
as
men
get
older
their
thoughts
turn
fondly
to
the
scenes
and
memories
of
their
youth
viner
if
ashton
was
really
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
he
may
have
come
down
here
with
no
other
thought
than
that
of
just
revisiting
his
old
home
for
sentimental
reasons
he
may
not
have
had
the
slightest
intention
for
instance
of
setting
up
a
claim
to
the
title
and
estates
i
do
understand
much
about
the
legal
aspect
of
this
said
viner
but
i
been
wondering
about
it
while
you
and
the
landlady
talked
supposing
ashton
to
be
the
lord
marketstoke
could
he
have
established
a
claim
such
as
you
speak
of
to
be
sure
answered
pawle
had
he
been
able
to
prove
that
he
was
the
real
simon
pure
he
would
have
stepped
into
title
and
estates
at
once
did
the
old
lady
say
that
the
seventh
earl
died
intestate
very
well
the
holders
since
his
time
that
is
to
say
charles
who
his
brother
death
being
presumed
became
eighth
earl
and
his
son
the
present
holder
would
have
had
to
account
for
everything
since
the
day
of
the
seventh
earl
death
when
the
seventh
earl
died
his
elder
son
lord
marketstoke
stepped
into
his
shoes
and
if
he
were
or
is
still
alive
he
in
them
still
all
he
had
to
do
at
any
moment
after
his
father
death
no
matter
who
had
come
into
title
and
estates
was
to
step
forward
and
say
i
am
now
i
want
my
rights
a
queer
business
altogether
commented
viner
but
whoever
ashton
was
he
dead
and
the
thing
that
concerns
me
is
this
if
he
really
was
earl
of
ellingham
do
you
think
that
fact
got
anything
to
do
with
his
murder
that
just
what
we
want
to
find
out
answered
pawle
eagerly
quite
conceivable
that
he
may
have
been
murdered
by
somebody
who
had
a
particular
interest
in
keeping
him
out
of
his
rights
such
things
have
been
known
i
want
to
go
into
all
that
but
now
here
another
matter
if
ashton
really
was
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
who
is
this
girl
whom
he
put
forward
as
his
ward
to
whom
he
left
his
considerable
fortune
and
about
whom
nobody
knows
anything
i
already
told
you
there
is
a
single
paper
or
document
about
her
that
i
can
discover
was
he
really
her
guardian
has
this
anything
to
do
with
it
asked
viner
does
it
come
into
things
pawle
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
he
appeared
to
have
struck
a
new
vein
of
thought
and
to
be
exploring
it
deeply
in
certain
events
it
would
come
into
it
pretty
strongly
he
muttered
at
last
i
tell
you
why
later
on
now
i
for
bed
and
first
thing
after
breakfast
in
the
morning
viner
we
go
to
work
viner
had
little
idea
of
what
the
old
solicitor
meant
as
regards
going
to
work
it
seemed
to
him
that
for
all
practical
purposes
they
were
already
in
a
maze
out
of
which
there
seemed
no
easy
way
and
he
was
not
at
all
sure
of
what
they
were
doing
when
breakfast
being
over
next
morning
pawle
conducted
him
across
the
square
to
the
old
churchyard
and
for
half
an
hour
walked
him
up
one
path
and
down
another
and
in
and
around
the
ancient
and
gravestones
do
you
know
what
i
been
looking
for
viner
asked
pawle
at
last
as
he
turned
towards
the
church
porch
i
was
looking
for
something
you
know
not
the
faintest
notion
answered
viner
dismally
i
wondered
i
was
looking
replied
pawle
with
a
faint
chuckle
to
see
if
i
could
find
any
tombstones
or
monuments
in
this
churchyard
bearing
the
name
ashton
there
is
one
i
take
it
from
that
significant
fact
that
ashton
did
come
down
here
to
visit
the
graves
of
his
kindred
but
now
come
into
the
church
summers
told
me
this
morning
that
there
a
chapel
here
in
which
the
family
have
been
interred
for
two
or
three
centuries
let
have
a
look
at
it
viner
who
had
a
dilettante
love
of
ancient
architecture
was
immediately
lost
in
admiration
of
the
fine
old
structure
into
which
he
and
his
companion
presently
stepped
he
stood
staring
at
the
high
rood
the
fine
old
rood
screen
the
beauty
of
the
clustered
columns
had
he
been
alone
and
on
any
other
occasion
he
would
have
spent
the
morning
in
wandering
around
nave
and
aisles
and
transepts
but
pawle
severely
practical
at
once
made
for
the
northeast
chapel
and
viner
after
another
glance
round
was
forced
to
follow
him
the
ellingham
chapel
whispered
the
old
solicitor
as
they
passed
a
fine
old
stone
screen
which
viner
mentally
registered
as
no
end
of
laid
here
what
a
profusion
of
monuments
viner
began
to
examine
those
monuments
as
well
as
the
gloom
of
the
november
morning
and
the
glass
of
the
windows
would
permit
and
before
very
long
he
turned
to
his
companion
who
was
laboriously
reading
the
inscription
on
a
great
which
stood
against
the
north
wall
i
say
he
whispered
here
a
curious
fact
which
in
view
of
what
we
heard
last
night
may
be
of
use
to
us
what
that
demanded
pawle
viner
took
him
by
the
elbow
and
led
him
over
to
the
south
wall
on
which
was
arranged
a
number
of
ancient
tablets
grouped
around
a
great
whereon
were
set
up
the
painted
effigies
of
a
gentleman
his
wife
and
several
sons
and
daughters
all
in
ruffs
kneeling
one
after
the
other
each
growing
less
in
size
and
stature
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
he
pointed
to
the
inscription
on
this
and
from
it
to
several
of
the
smaller
monuments
look
here
he
said
there
are
commemorated
here
from
until
no
end
of
men
and
women
and
now
see
there
a
certain
christian
name
a
woman
name
which
occurs
over
and
over
again
there
it
is
and
there
and
here
and
here
and
here
again
evidently
been
a
favourite
family
name
among
the
women
for
three
hundred
years
at
least
you
see
what
it
is
avice
pawle
peered
at
the
various
places
to
which
his
finger
pointed
yes
he
answered
i
see
it
several
times
as
you
say
avice
yes
miss
wickham
christian
name
is
avice
said
viner
pawle
started
god
bless
me
he
exclaimed
so
it
is
i
forgotten
that
dear
me
now
that
very
odd
too
odd
perhaps
to
be
a
coincidence
very
interesting
indeed
favourite
family
name
without
a
doubt
viner
silently
went
round
the
chapel
inspecting
every
monument
its
four
walls
sheltered
it
occurs
just
nineteen
times
he
announced
at
last
now
is
it
a
coincidence
that
miss
wickham
name
should
be
avice
or
is
it
that
there
some
connection
between
her
and
all
these
dead
and
gone
avices
very
strange
admitted
pawle
viner
we
go
next
and
have
a
look
at
the
parish
registers
but
look
here
not
a
word
to
parson
or
clerk
about
our
business
we
merely
wish
to
make
search
for
a
certain
legal
purpose
eh
three
hours
later
viner
heartily
weary
of
turning
over
old
registers
full
of
crabbed
writing
was
glad
when
pawle
closed
the
one
on
which
he
was
engaged
intimated
that
he
had
seen
all
he
wanted
paid
the
fees
for
his
search
and
whispered
to
his
companion
that
they
would
go
to
lunch
well
asked
viner
as
they
walked
across
the
square
to
the
ellington
arms
have
we
done
anything
probably
answered
pawle
for
you
never
know
how
these
little
matters
might
help
we
established
two
facts
anyway
one
that
there
have
never
been
any
folk
of
the
name
of
ashton
in
this
town
since
the
registers
came
into
being
in
the
other
that
the
name
avice
was
a
very
favourite
one
indeed
amongst
the
women
of
the
family
and
there
just
another
little
fact
which
i
discovered
and
said
nothing
about
while
the
vicar
and
clerk
were
about
it
may
be
nothing
and
it
may
be
something
what
is
it
asked
viner
well
answered
pawle
pausing
a
few
yards
away
from
the
porch
of
the
hotel
and
speaking
in
a
confidential
voice
it
this
in
turning
up
the
records
of
the
family
as
far
as
they
are
shown
in
their
parish
registers
i
found
that
stephen
john
sixth
earl
of
ellingham
married
one
georgina
wickham
now
is
that
another
coincidence
there
you
get
the
two
names
in
combination
avice
wickham
that
particular
countess
of
ellingham
would
of
course
be
the
grandmother
of
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
did
he
think
of
her
maiden
name
wickham
when
he
wanted
a
new
one
for
himself
possibly
and
when
he
married
and
had
a
daughter
did
he
think
of
the
christian
name
so
popular
with
his
own
womenfolk
of
previous
generations
and
call
his
daughter
avice
and
are
marketstoke
and
wickham
and
ashton
all
one
and
the
same
man
upon
my
word
it
a
strange
muddle
exclaimed
viner
nothing
as
yet
to
what
it
will
be
remarked
pawle
sententiously
come
on
i
famishing
let
lunch
and
then
we
go
back
to
town
another
surprise
awaited
them
when
they
walked
into
pawle
office
in
bedford
row
at
four
that
afternoon
a
card
lay
on
the
old
lawyer
and
after
glancing
at
it
he
passed
it
to
viner
see
that
he
said
now
who
on
earth
is
armitstead
ashton
armitstead
of
rouendale
house
rawtenstall
who
left
this
he
went
on
as
a
clerk
entered
the
room
with
some
letters
a
gentleman
who
called
at
three
sir
replied
the
clerk
he
said
he
travelled
specially
from
lancashire
to
see
you
about
the
ashton
affair
he
going
to
call
again
sir
in
fact
concluded
the
clerk
glancing
into
the
anteroom
i
think
he
here
now
bring
him
in
commanded
pawle
he
made
a
grimace
at
viner
as
the
clerk
disappeared
you
see
how
things
develop
he
murmured
what
are
we
going
to
hear
next
chapter
xi
what
happened
in
paris
the
man
who
presently
walked
in
a
tall
evidently
prosperous
person
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
glanced
keenly
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
two
men
who
awaited
him
mr
pawle
he
inquired
as
he
dropped
into
the
chair
which
the
old
lawyer
silently
indicated
at
the
side
of
his
desk
one
of
your
partners
no
doubt
he
added
looking
again
at
viner
no
sir
replied
pawle
this
is
viner
who
gave
evidence
in
the
case
you
want
to
see
me
about
you
can
speak
freely
before
him
what
is
it
you
have
to
say
mr
armitstead
not
perhaps
very
much
but
it
may
be
of
use
answered
the
visitor
the
fact
is
that
like
most
folk
i
read
the
accounts
of
this
ashton
murder
in
the
newspapers
and
i
gave
particular
attention
to
what
was
said
by
the
man
hyde
at
the
inquest
the
other
day
it
was
what
he
said
in
regard
to
the
man
whom
he
alleges
he
saw
leaving
lonsdale
passage
that
made
me
come
specially
to
town
to
see
you
i
do
know
he
went
on
glancing
at
the
card
which
still
lay
on
pawle
if
you
know
my
name
at
all
i
a
pretty
lancashire
manufacturer
and
i
was
a
member
of
parliament
for
some
years
for
the
richdale
valley
division
i
did
put
up
again
at
the
last
general
election
pawle
bowed
just
so
armitstead
he
answered
and
there
something
you
know
about
this
case
i
know
this
replied
armitstead
i
met
john
ashton
in
paris
some
weeks
ago
we
were
at
the
hotel
bristol
together
in
fact
we
met
and
introduced
ourselves
to
each
other
in
an
odd
way
we
arrived
at
the
hotel
bristol
at
the
same
time
he
from
italy
i
from
london
and
we
registered
at
the
same
moment
now
i
have
a
habit
of
always
signing
my
name
in
full
armitstead
ashton
armitstead
i
signed
first
he
followed
he
looked
at
me
and
smiled
got
one
of
my
names
anyway
sir
he
remarked
i
see
you
hail
from
where
i
hailed
from
many
a
long
year
ago
you
a
lancashire
man
i
said
left
lancashire
more
years
ago
than
i
like
to
think
of
he
answered
with
a
laugh
and
then
we
got
talking
and
he
told
me
that
he
had
emigrated
to
australia
when
he
was
young
and
that
he
was
going
back
to
england
for
the
first
time
we
had
more
talk
during
the
two
or
three
days
that
we
were
at
the
bristol
together
and
we
came
to
the
conclusion
that
we
were
distantly
related
a
long
way
back
but
he
told
me
that
as
far
as
he
was
aware
he
had
no
close
relations
living
and
when
i
suggested
to
him
that
he
ought
to
go
down
to
lancashire
and
look
up
old
scenes
and
old
friends
he
replied
that
he
no
intention
of
doing
so
he
must
he
said
have
been
completely
forgotten
in
his
native
place
by
this
time
did
he
tell
you
what
his
native
place
was
mr
armitstead
asked
pawle
who
had
given
viner
two
or
three
expressive
glances
during
the
visitor
story
yes
replied
armitstead
he
did
blackburn
he
left
it
as
a
very
young
man
well
said
pawle
there
a
considerable
amount
of
interest
in
what
you
tell
us
for
viner
and
myself
have
been
making
certain
inquiries
during
the
last
hours
and
we
formed
or
nearly
formed
a
theory
which
your
information
upsets
ashtons
of
blackburn
we
must
go
into
that
for
we
particularly
want
to
know
who
john
ashton
was
there
a
great
deal
depending
on
it
did
he
tell
you
more
about
himself
no
replied
the
visitor
except
that
he
been
exceedingly
fortunate
in
australia
and
had
made
a
good
deal
of
money
and
was
going
to
settle
down
here
in
london
he
took
my
address
and
said
write
and
ask
me
to
dine
with
him
as
soon
as
he
got
a
house
to
his
liking
and
he
did
write
only
last
week
inviting
me
to
call
next
time
i
was
in
town
then
i
saw
the
accounts
of
his
murder
in
the
papers
a
very
sad
thing
a
very
mysterious
thing
remarked
pawle
i
wish
we
could
get
some
light
on
it
the
visitor
looked
from
one
man
to
the
other
and
lowered
his
voice
a
little
it
possible
i
can
give
you
a
little
he
said
that
indeed
is
the
real
reason
why
i
set
off
to
see
you
this
morning
you
will
remember
that
hyde
the
man
who
is
charged
with
the
murder
said
before
the
coroner
that
as
he
turned
into
lonsdale
passage
he
saw
coming
out
of
it
a
tall
man
in
black
clothes
who
was
swathed
to
the
very
eyes
in
a
big
white
muffler
yes
said
pawle
well
i
saw
such
a
man
with
ashton
in
paris
answered
armitstead
description
exactly
tallies
with
what
i
myself
should
have
said
pawle
looked
at
his
visitor
with
still
more
interest
and
attention
now
that
really
is
of
importance
he
exclaimed
if
hyde
saw
such
a
man
as
i
believe
he
did
and
you
saw
such
a
man
then
that
man
must
exist
and
the
facts
that
you
saw
him
with
ashton
and
that
hyde
saw
him
in
close
proximity
to
the
place
where
ashton
was
murdered
are
of
the
highest
consequence
but
you
can
tell
us
more
mr
armitstead
unfortunately
very
little
replied
the
visitor
what
i
saw
was
on
the
night
before
i
left
paris
after
it
i
never
saw
ashton
again
to
speak
to
it
was
late
at
night
do
you
know
the
rue
royale
there
is
at
the
end
of
it
a
restaurant
close
to
the
place
de
la
concorde
i
was
sitting
outside
this
about
a
quarter
to
eleven
when
i
saw
ashton
and
the
man
i
am
speaking
of
pass
along
the
pavement
in
the
direction
of
the
madeleine
what
made
me
particularly
notice
the
man
was
the
fact
that
although
it
was
an
unusually
warm
night
he
was
closely
muffled
in
a
big
white
silk
handkerchief
it
was
swathed
about
his
throat
his
chin
his
mouth
it
reached
in
fact
right
up
to
his
eyes
an
odd
thing
on
such
a
warm
night
ashton
who
was
in
evening
dress
had
his
light
overcoat
thrown
well
back
he
was
talking
very
volubly
as
they
passed
me
the
other
man
was
listening
with
evident
attention
would
you
know
the
man
if
you
saw
him
again
asked
viner
i
should
most
certainly
know
him
if
i
saw
him
dressed
and
muffled
in
the
same
way
asserted
armitstead
and
i
believe
i
could
recognize
him
from
his
eyes
which
indeed
were
all
that
i
could
really
see
of
him
he
was
so
muffled
i
tell
you
that
it
was
impossible
to
see
if
he
was
a
man
or
a
bearded
man
but
i
did
see
his
eyes
for
he
turned
them
for
an
instant
full
on
the
light
of
the
restaurant
they
were
unusually
dark
full
and
brilliant
his
glance
would
best
be
described
as
flashing
and
i
should
say
from
my
impression
at
the
time
and
from
what
i
remember
of
his
dress
that
he
was
a
foreigner
probably
an
italian
you
did
see
this
man
at
your
hotel
asked
pawle
no
i
never
saw
him
except
on
this
one
occasion
replied
armitstead
and
i
did
not
see
ashton
after
that
i
left
paris
very
early
the
next
morning
for
rouen
where
i
had
some
business
you
think
this
matter
of
the
man
in
the
muffler
important
now
that
you
told
us
what
you
have
armitstead
i
think
it
of
the
utmost
importance
and
consequence
to
hyde
answered
pawle
you
must
see
his
solicitor
he
viner
solicitor
too
and
offer
to
give
evidence
when
hyde
brought
up
again
it
will
be
of
the
greatest
help
there
no
doubt
to
me
at
any
rate
that
the
man
hyde
saw
leaving
the
scene
of
the
murder
is
the
man
you
saw
with
ashton
in
paris
but
now
who
is
he
ashton
as
we
happen
to
know
left
his
ship
at
naples
and
travelled
to
england
through
italy
and
france
is
this
man
some
fellow
that
he
picked
up
on
the
way
his
general
appearance
now
how
did
that
strike
you
he
was
certainly
a
man
of
great
distinction
of
manner
declared
armitstead
he
had
the
air
and
bearing
of
well
of
a
personage
i
should
say
he
was
somebody
you
know
what
i
mean
a
man
of
superior
position
and
so
on
viner
exclaimed
pawle
that
man
must
be
found
there
must
be
people
in
london
who
saw
him
that
night
people
ca
disappear
like
that
we
set
to
work
on
that
track
find
him
we
must
now
all
the
evidence
goes
to
show
that
he
and
ashton
were
in
company
that
night
probably
they
been
dining
together
and
he
was
accompanying
ashton
to
his
house
how
is
it
that
no
one
at
all
has
come
forward
to
say
that
ashton
was
seen
with
this
man
it
really
extraordinary
armitstead
shook
his
head
there
one
thing
you
forgetting
are
you
he
said
ashton
and
this
man
may
have
been
in
each
other
company
many
minutes
when
the
murder
took
place
ashton
may
have
been
trapped
i
do
know
much
about
criminal
affairs
but
in
reading
the
accounts
of
the
proceedings
before
the
magistrate
and
the
coroner
an
idea
struck
me
which
so
far
as
i
could
gather
from
the
newspapers
does
seem
to
have
struck
any
one
else
what
that
demanded
pawle
all
ideas
are
welcome
well
this
replied
armitstead
in
one
of
the
london
newspapers
there
was
a
plan
a
rough
sketchmap
of
the
passage
in
which
the
murder
took
place
i
gathered
from
it
that
on
each
side
of
that
passage
there
are
yards
or
gardens
at
the
backs
of
houses
the
houses
on
one
side
belong
to
some
terrace
on
the
other
to
the
square
markendale
square
in
which
ashton
lived
now
may
it
not
be
that
the
murder
itself
was
actually
committed
in
one
of
those
houses
and
that
the
body
was
carried
out
through
a
yard
or
garden
to
where
it
was
found
ashton
was
a
big
and
heavy
man
observed
viner
no
one
man
could
have
carried
him
just
so
agreed
armitstead
but
do
you
think
there
a
probability
that
more
than
one
man
was
engaged
in
this
affair
the
man
in
the
muffler
hurrying
away
may
have
only
been
one
of
several
aye
said
pawle
with
a
deep
sigh
there
something
in
all
that
it
may
be
as
you
say
a
conspiracy
if
we
only
knew
the
real
object
of
the
crime
but
it
appears
to
be
becoming
increasingly
difficult
to
find
it
what
is
it
he
asked
as
his
clerk
came
into
the
room
with
a
card
i
engaged
the
clerk
came
on
however
laid
the
card
before
his
employer
and
whispered
a
few
words
to
him
a
moment
then
i
ring
said
pawle
he
turned
to
his
two
companions
as
the
clerk
retired
and
closed
the
door
and
smiled
as
he
held
up
the
card
here
another
man
who
wants
to
tell
me
something
about
the
ashton
case
he
exclaimed
it
been
quite
a
stroke
of
luck
having
that
paragraph
in
the
newspapers
asking
for
information
from
anybody
who
could
give
it
what
this
asked
viner
jan
van
hoeren
diamond
merchant
read
pawle
from
the
card
hatton
garden
ah
armitstead
exclaimed
diamonds
i
should
wonder
if
you
right
remarked
pawle
diamonds
i
believe
are
to
hatton
garden
what
cabbages
and
carrots
are
to
covent
he
touched
his
bell
and
the
clerk
appeared
bring
van
hoeren
this
way
he
said
there
entered
hat
in
hand
bowing
all
round
a
little
fat
man
whose
beard
was
and
glossy
whose
lips
were
red
whose
nose
was
his
most
decided
feature
his
hat
was
new
and
shining
his
black
overcoat
of
superfine
cloth
was
ornamented
with
a
collar
of
undoubted
sable
he
carried
a
umbrella
but
there
was
one
thing
on
him
that
put
all
the
rest
of
his
finery
in
the
shade
in
the
folds
of
his
black
satin
stock
lay
a
pearl
such
a
pearl
as
few
folk
ever
have
the
privilege
of
seeing
it
was
as
big
as
a
moderately
sized
hazel
nut
and
the
three
men
who
looked
at
it
knew
that
it
was
something
wonderful
take
a
chair
van
hoeren
said
pawle
genially
you
want
to
tell
me
something
about
this
ashton
case
very
much
obliged
to
you
sure
these
gentlemen
are
both
interested
considerably
in
that
case
and
if
you
can
give
me
any
information
that
will
throw
any
light
on
it
van
hoeren
deposited
his
plump
figure
in
a
convenient
chair
and
looked
round
the
circle
of
faces
one
thing
there
is
i
do
see
in
them
newspapers
pawle
he
said
in
strongly
nasal
accents
maybe
nobody
do
know
nothings
about
it
what
so
i
come
to
tell
you
what
i
know
see
something
very
good
of
you
i
sure
replied
pawle
what
may
it
be
van
hoeren
made
a
significant
grimace
it
seemed
to
imply
that
there
was
a
great
deal
to
be
told
some
of
us
my
way
we
know
ashton
he
said
in
hatton
garden
you
understand
dealers
in
diamonds
see
me
and
haas
and
aarons
and
one
or
two
more
business
you
done
business
with
mr
ashton
asked
the
old
lawyer
just
so
no
done
nothing
replied
van
hoeren
not
a
shilling
worth
but
we
know
him
he
came
down
there
and
we
do
see
nothing
in
them
papers
that
we
expected
to
see
and
today
two
or
three
of
us
we
lunch
together
and
haas
he
says
lawyer
men
he
says
want
information
you
go
and
give
it
to
so
well
what
is
it
demanded
pawle
van
hoeren
leaned
forward
and
looked
from
one
face
to
another
ashton
he
said
was
carrying
a
big
diamond
about
in
his
pocketbook
armitstead
let
a
slight
exclamation
escape
his
lips
viner
glanced
at
pawle
and
pawle
fastened
his
eyes
on
his
latest
caller
ashton
was
carrying
a
big
diamond
about
in
his
pocketbook
he
said
ah
have
you
seen
it
several
times
i
see
it
replied
van
hoeren
my
trade
do
it
others
of
us
we
see
it
too
he
wanted
to
sell
it
suggested
pawle
there
ai
so
many
people
could
afford
to
buy
it
said
van
hoeren
why
exclaimed
pawle
was
it
so
valuable
then
the
diamond
merchant
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
waved
the
umbrella
which
he
was
carefully
nursing
in
his
hands
oh
well
he
answered
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
pounds
it
was
worth
yes
chapter
xii
the
grey
mare
inn
the
three
men
who
heard
this
announcement
were
conscious
that
at
this
point
the
ashton
case
entered
upon
an
entirely
new
phase
mind
was
swept
clean
away
from
the
episode
in
paris
viner
from
the
revelations
at
marketstoke
pawle
suddenly
realized
that
here
at
last
was
something
material
and
tangible
which
opened
out
all
sorts
of
possibilities
and
he
voiced
the
thoughts
of
his
two
companions
as
he
turned
in
amazement
on
the
fat
little
man
who
sat
complacently
nursing
his
umbrella
what
he
exclaimed
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
ashton
was
walking
about
london
with
a
diamond
worth
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
his
pocket
incredible
do
see
nothing
so
very
incredible
about
it
retorted
van
hoeren
i
could
show
you
men
what
carries
diamonds
worth
twice
that
much
in
their
pockets
about
the
garden
that
business
said
pawle
i
heard
of
such
things
but
you
all
know
each
other
over
there
i
told
ashton
was
a
diamond
merchant
god
bless
me
he
was
probably
murdered
for
that
stone
that
just
what
i
come
to
you
about
eh
suggested
van
hoeren
you
see
nothing
if
he
show
that
diamond
to
me
and
such
as
me
we
do
think
nothing
of
that
all
in
our
way
of
business
but
if
he
gets
showing
it
to
other
people
in
public
places
what
just
so
asserted
pawle
sheer
tempting
of
providence
i
amazed
but
how
did
you
get
to
know
ashton
and
to
hear
of
this
diamond
did
he
come
to
you
called
on
me
at
my
office
answered
van
hoeren
laconically
pulled
out
the
diamond
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
it
was
worth
well
i
introduce
him
to
some
of
the
other
boys
in
the
garden
see
he
show
them
the
diamond
too
we
reckon
it
worth
what
i
say
fifty
to
sixty
thousand
so
did
he
want
to
sell
it
demanded
pawle
oh
well
yes
he
would
have
minded
replied
the
diamond
merchant
was
particular
about
it
you
know
rich
man
did
he
tell
you
anything
about
it
how
he
got
it
and
so
on
asked
pawle
was
there
any
history
attached
to
it
oh
nothing
much
answered
van
hoeren
he
told
me
he
had
it
some
years
got
it
in
australia
where
he
come
from
to
london
got
it
cheap
he
did
lots
of
things
like
that
in
our
business
and
carried
it
in
his
pocket
exclaimed
pawle
he
stared
hard
at
van
hoeren
as
if
his
mind
was
revolving
some
unpleasant
idea
i
suppose
all
the
people
you
introduced
him
to
are
all
right
he
asked
oh
they
all
right
affirmed
van
hoeren
with
a
laugh
give
my
word
for
any
of
eh
but
ashton
if
he
pulls
that
diamond
out
to
show
to
anybody
out
of
the
trade
you
understand
well
then
lots
of
fellows
in
this
town
would
settle
him
to
get
hold
of
it
what
i
think
you
right
said
pawle
he
glanced
at
viner
this
puts
a
new
complexion
on
affairs
he
remarked
we
shall
have
to
let
the
police
know
of
this
i
much
obliged
to
you
van
hoeren
you
wo
mind
giving
evidence
about
this
if
it
necessary
do
mind
nothing
said
van
hoeren
me
and
the
other
boys
we
think
you
ought
to
know
about
that
diamond
see
he
went
away
and
pawle
turned
to
viner
and
armitstead
i
should
wonder
if
we
getting
at
something
like
a
real
clue
he
said
it
seems
evident
that
ashton
was
not
very
particular
about
showing
his
diamond
to
people
if
he
show
it
readily
to
a
lot
of
hatton
garden
diamond
merchants
who
after
all
were
strangers
to
him
how
do
we
know
that
he
would
show
it
to
other
men
the
fact
is
wealthy
men
like
that
are
often
very
careless
about
their
possessions
possibly
a
diamond
worth
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
pounds
was
of
so
much
importance
in
ashton
eyes
as
it
would
have
been
in
well
in
mine
and
how
do
we
know
that
he
did
show
the
diamond
to
the
man
with
the
muffler
in
paris
and
that
the
fellow
followed
him
here
and
murdered
him
for
it
possible
said
armitstead
does
it
strike
you
as
strange
though
suggested
viner
that
the
first
news
of
this
diamond
comes
from
van
hoeren
one
would
have
thought
that
ashton
would
have
mentioned
it
and
shown
it
to
miss
wickham
and
killenhall
yet
apparently
he
never
did
yes
that
does
seem
odd
asserted
pawle
but
there
seems
to
be
no
end
of
oddity
in
this
case
and
there
one
thing
that
must
be
done
at
once
we
must
have
a
full
and
thorough
search
and
examination
of
all
ashton
effects
his
house
must
be
thoroughly
searched
for
papers
and
so
on
viner
i
suppose
you
going
home
do
me
the
favour
to
call
at
miss
wickham
and
tell
her
that
i
propose
to
come
there
at
ten
tomorrow
morning
to
go
through
ashton
desk
and
his
various
belongings
with
her
surely
there
must
be
something
discoverable
that
will
throw
more
light
on
the
matter
and
in
the
meantime
viner
do
say
anything
to
her
about
our
journey
to
marketstoke
leave
that
for
a
while
viner
went
away
from
crawle
pawle
and
rattenbury
in
company
with
armitstead
outside
the
lancashire
business
man
gave
him
a
shrewd
glance
i
very
much
doubt
if
that
diamond
has
anything
whatever
to
do
with
ashton
murder
he
said
from
what
i
saw
of
him
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
very
practical
man
full
of
business
aptitude
and
common
sense
and
i
do
believe
that
he
make
a
practice
of
walking
about
london
with
a
diamond
of
that
value
in
his
pocket
it
all
very
well
that
he
should
have
it
in
his
pocket
when
he
went
down
to
hatton
garden
he
had
a
purpose
but
that
he
should
always
carry
it
no
i
do
credit
that
mr
viner
i
can
scarcely
credit
such
a
foolish
thing
myself
said
viner
but
where
is
the
diamond
perhaps
you
find
it
tomorrow
suggested
armitstead
the
man
would
be
sure
to
have
some
place
in
his
house
where
he
kept
his
valuables
i
shall
be
curious
to
hear
are
you
staying
in
town
inquired
viner
i
shall
be
at
the
hotel
cecil
for
a
fortnight
at
least
answered
armitstead
and
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
to
you
or
pawle
you
only
to
ring
me
up
there
you
no
doubt
yourself
i
think
that
the
unfortunate
fellow
hyde
is
innocent
none
said
viner
no
doubt
whatever
but
the
police
have
a
strong
case
against
him
and
unless
we
can
find
the
actual
murderer
i
afraid
hyde
in
a
very
dangerous
position
well
said
armitstead
in
these
cases
you
never
know
what
a
sudden
and
unexpected
turn
of
events
may
do
that
man
with
the
muffler
is
the
chap
you
want
to
get
hold
of
i
sure
of
that
viner
went
home
and
dined
with
his
aunt
and
their
two
guests
sisters
whom
he
endeavoured
to
cheer
up
by
saying
that
things
were
developing
as
favourably
as
could
be
expected
and
that
he
hoped
to
have
good
news
for
them
ere
long
they
were
simple
souls
pathetically
grateful
for
any
scrap
of
sympathy
and
comfort
and
he
strove
to
appear
more
confident
about
the
chances
of
clearing
this
unlucky
brother
than
he
really
felt
it
was
his
intention
to
go
round
to
number
seven
during
the
evening
to
deliver
pawle
message
to
miss
wickham
but
before
he
rose
from
his
own
table
a
message
arrived
by
miss
wickham
would
viner
be
kind
enough
to
come
to
the
house
at
once
at
this
viner
excused
himself
to
his
guests
and
hurried
round
to
number
seven
to
find
miss
wickham
and
killenhall
now
in
mourning
garments
in
company
with
a
little
man
whom
viner
at
once
recognized
as
a
tradesman
of
westbourne
grove
a
florist
and
fruiterer
named
barleyfield
who
was
patronized
by
all
the
folk
of
the
neighbourhood
he
smiled
and
bowed
as
viner
entered
the
room
and
turned
to
miss
wickham
as
if
suggesting
that
she
should
explain
his
presence
oh
mr
viner
said
miss
wickham
i
so
sorry
to
send
for
you
so
hurriedly
but
barleyfield
came
to
tell
us
that
he
could
give
some
information
about
ashton
and
as
pawle
is
available
and
i
do
like
to
send
for
a
i
thought
that
you
perhaps
to
be
sure
said
viner
what
is
it
mr
barleyfield
barleyfield
who
had
obviously
attired
himself
in
his
sunday
raiment
for
the
purposes
of
his
call
and
had
further
shown
respect
for
the
occasion
by
wearing
a
black
cravat
smiled
as
he
looked
from
the
two
ladies
to
viner
well
viner
he
answered
i
tell
you
what
it
is
it
may
help
a
bit
in
clearing
up
things
for
i
understand
there
a
great
deal
of
mystery
about
ashton
death
now
i
told
sir
that
nobody
especially
these
good
ladies
knows
nothing
about
what
the
deceased
gentleman
used
to
do
with
himself
of
an
evening
as
a
rule
just
so
well
you
know
viner
a
tradesman
like
myself
generally
knows
a
good
deal
about
the
people
of
his
neighbourhood
i
knew
ashton
very
well
indeed
he
was
a
good
customer
of
mine
and
sometimes
he
stop
and
have
a
bit
of
chat
with
me
and
i
can
tell
you
where
he
very
often
spent
an
hour
or
two
of
an
evening
yes
where
asked
viner
at
the
grey
mare
inn
sir
answered
barleyfield
promptly
i
have
often
seen
him
there
myself
the
grey
mare
inn
exclaimed
viner
while
killenhall
and
miss
wickham
looked
at
each
other
wonderingly
where
is
that
it
sounds
like
the
name
of
some
village
tavern
ah
but
you
do
know
this
part
of
london
as
i
do
sir
said
barleyfield
with
a
knowing
smile
if
you
did
you
know
the
grey
mare
well
enough
it
an
institution
it
a
real
place
between
westbourne
grove
and
notting
hill
one
of
the
very
last
of
the
old
taverns
with
a
behind
it
and
a
of
a
very
comfortable
sort
where
various
old
fogies
of
the
neighbourhood
gather
of
an
evening
and
smoke
churchwarden
pipes
and
tell
tales
of
the
olden
days
i
rather
gathered
from
what
i
saw
that
it
was
the
old
atmosphere
that
attracted
ashton
made
him
think
of
bygone
england
you
know
mr
viner
and
you
say
he
went
there
regularly
asked
viner
i
seen
him
there
a
great
deal
sir
for
i
usually
turn
in
there
for
half
an
hour
or
so
myself
of
an
evening
when
business
is
over
and
had
my
supper
answered
barleyfield
i
should
say
that
he
went
there
four
or
five
nights
a
week
and
no
doubt
conversed
with
the
people
he
met
there
suggested
viner
he
was
a
friendly
sociable
man
sir
said
barleyfield
yes
he
was
fond
of
a
talk
but
there
was
one
man
there
that
he
seemed
to
associate
with
an
elderly
superior
gentleman
whose
name
i
know
though
i
familiar
enough
with
his
appearance
him
and
ashton
i
often
seen
sitting
in
a
particular
corner
smoking
their
cigars
and
talking
together
and
if
it
of
any
importance
i
saw
them
talking
like
that
at
the
grey
mare
the
very
evening
that
that
ashton
died
mr
viner
what
time
was
that
asked
viner
about
the
usual
time
sir
or
so
replied
barleyfield
i
generally
look
in
about
that
time
to
ten
did
you
leave
them
talking
there
inquired
viner
they
were
there
when
i
left
sir
at
a
quarter
past
ten
answered
barleyfield
talking
in
their
usual
corner
and
you
say
you
do
know
who
this
man
is
i
do
i
know
him
by
sight
but
he
a
comparatively
recent
comer
to
the
grey
mare
i
noticed
him
for
a
year
or
so
not
longer
viner
glanced
at
the
two
ladies
i
suppose
you
never
heard
ashton
mention
the
grey
mare
he
asked
we
never
heard
ashton
say
anything
about
his
movements
answered
miss
wickham
we
used
to
wonder
sometimes
if
he
joined
a
club
or
if
he
had
friends
that
we
knew
nothing
about
well
said
viner
turning
to
the
florist
do
you
think
you
could
take
me
to
the
grey
mare
mr
barleyfield
nothing
easier
sir
open
to
one
and
all
then
if
you
the
time
to
spare
we
go
now
said
viner
he
lingered
behind
a
moment
to
tell
miss
wickham
of
pawle
appointment
for
the
morning
and
then
went
away
with
barleyfield
in
the
notting
hill
direction
i
suppose
you
been
at
the
grey
mare
since
death
he
asked
as
they
walked
along
once
or
twice
sir
replied
barleyfield
and
you
no
doubt
heard
the
murder
discussed
suggested
viner
i
heard
it
discussed
hard
enough
sir
there
and
elsewhere
replied
the
florist
but
at
the
gray
mare
itself
i
do
think
anybody
knew
that
this
man
who
been
murdered
was
the
same
as
the
gentleman
who
used
to
drop
in
there
sometimes
they
did
when
i
was
last
in
anyway
perhaps
this
gentleman
i
mentioned
to
you
might
know
ashton
might
have
told
his
name
to
him
but
you
know
how
it
is
in
these
places
viner
people
drop
in
even
regularly
and
may
have
a
bit
of
talk
with
them
without
having
the
least
idea
who
they
are
between
you
and
me
sir
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
ashton
was
a
man
who
liked
to
see
a
bit
of
what
call
informal
tavern
life
and
he
hit
on
this
place
by
accident
in
one
of
his
walks
round
and
took
to
coming
where
he
could
be
at
his
ease
amongst
strangers
no
doubt
agreed
viner
he
followed
his
guide
through
various
squares
and
streets
until
they
came
to
the
object
of
their
pilgrimage
a
house
set
back
a
little
from
the
road
with
a
swinging
sign
in
front
and
a
garden
at
the
side
barleyfield
led
him
through
this
garden
to
a
whence
they
passed
into
a
roomy
parlour
which
reminded
viner
of
old
coaching
prints
he
would
scarcely
have
believed
it
possible
that
such
a
room
could
be
found
in
london
there
were
several
men
in
it
and
he
nudged
his
companion
elbow
let
us
sit
down
in
a
quiet
corner
and
have
something
to
drink
he
said
i
just
want
to
take
a
look
at
this
place
and
its
frequenters
barleyfield
led
him
to
a
nook
near
the
and
beckoned
to
an
aproned
boy
who
hung
about
with
a
tray
under
his
arm
but
before
viner
could
give
an
order
his
companion
touched
his
arm
and
motioned
towards
the
door
here
the
gentleman
ashton
used
to
talk
to
he
whispered
the
tall
man
just
coming
in
chapter
xiii
the
japanese
cabinet
remembering
that
barleyfield
had
said
that
the
man
who
now
entered
had
been
in
ashton
company
in
that
very
room
on
the
evening
of
the
murder
viner
looked
at
him
with
keen
interest
and
speculation
he
was
a
tall
man
of
professional
appearance
and
of
a
large
heavy
solemn
face
the
evidently
usual
pallor
of
which
was
deepened
by
his
black
overcoat
and
cravat
an
eminently
respectable
unimaginative
man
in
viner
opinion
and
of
a
type
which
one
may
see
by
the
dozen
in
the
precincts
of
the
temple
a
man
who
would
be
content
to
do
a
day
work
in
a
placid
fashion
and
who
cherished
no
ambition
to
set
the
thames
on
fire
certainly
so
viner
thought
from
appearances
not
the
man
to
commit
a
peculiarly
daring
murder
nevertheless
knowing
what
he
did
he
watched
him
closely
the
newcomer
on
entering
glanced
at
once
at
a
quiet
corner
of
the
room
and
seeing
it
unoccupied
turned
to
the
bar
where
the
landlord
who
was
as
as
his
surroundings
was
glancing
over
the
evening
paper
he
asked
for
whisky
and
soda
and
when
he
took
up
the
glass
drank
slowly
and
thoughtfully
suddenly
he
turned
to
the
landlord
have
you
seen
that
gentleman
lately
that
i
sometimes
talked
to
in
the
corner
there
he
asked
the
landlord
glanced
across
the
room
and
shook
his
head
ca
say
that
i
have
sir
he
answered
the
tallish
gentleman
with
a
grey
beard
no
he
has
been
in
this
last
night
or
two
the
other
man
sat
down
his
glass
and
drew
something
from
his
pocket
i
promised
to
bring
him
a
specimen
of
some
cigars
i
bought
lately
he
said
laying
an
envelope
on
the
counter
i
ca
stop
tonight
if
he
should
come
in
will
you
give
him
that
he
know
what
it
is
good
heavens
muttered
viner
as
he
turned
in
surprise
to
barleyfield
these
men
evidently
do
know
that
the
man
they
talking
about
is
murdered
whispered
barleyfield
with
a
grim
smile
nothing
wonderful
in
that
viner
they
have
connected
ashton
with
the
man
they
mentioning
that
all
and
yet
ashton
portrait
has
been
in
the
papers
exclaimed
viner
it
amazes
me
aye
just
so
sir
said
barleyfield
but
a
hundred
yards
in
london
takes
you
into
another
world
viner
for
all
practical
purposes
lonsdale
passage
though
it
only
a
mile
away
is
as
much
separated
from
this
spot
as
new
york
is
from
london
well
that
the
man
i
told
you
of
sir
the
man
in
question
drank
off
the
remaining
contents
of
his
glass
nodded
to
the
landlord
and
walked
out
and
viner
was
suddenly
minded
to
do
something
towards
getting
information
look
here
he
said
i
going
to
ask
that
landlord
a
question
or
two
come
with
me
he
went
up
to
the
bar
barleyfield
following
in
close
attendance
and
gave
the
landlord
a
significant
glance
can
i
have
a
word
with
you
in
private
he
asked
the
landlord
looked
his
questioner
over
and
promptly
opened
a
flap
in
the
counter
step
inside
sir
he
said
indicating
a
door
in
the
rear
private
room
there
sir
viner
and
barleyfield
walked
into
a
little
snugly
furnished
the
landlord
followed
and
closed
the
door
do
you
happen
to
know
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
was
speaking
to
you
just
now
asked
viner
going
straight
to
his
point
i
a
very
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
know
it
no
more
idea
than
i
have
of
yours
sir
replied
the
landlord
with
a
shrewd
glance
viner
pulled
out
a
card
and
laid
it
on
the
table
that
is
my
name
he
said
you
and
the
gentleman
who
has
just
gone
out
were
speaking
just
now
of
another
gentleman
whom
he
used
to
meet
here
who
used
to
sit
with
him
in
that
far
corner
just
so
you
know
the
name
of
that
gentleman
either
no
more
than
i
know
the
others
sir
replied
the
landlord
shaking
his
head
lord
bless
you
folks
may
come
in
here
for
a
year
or
two
and
unless
they
happen
to
be
neighbours
of
mine
i
do
know
who
they
are
now
there
your
friend
there
he
went
on
indicating
barleyfield
with
a
smile
i
know
his
face
as
that
of
a
customer
but
i
do
know
who
he
is
that
gentleman
who
just
gone
out
he
been
in
the
habit
of
dropping
in
here
for
a
twelvemonth
maybe
but
i
never
remember
hearing
his
name
as
for
the
gentleman
he
referred
to
why
i
know
him
as
one
that
come
in
here
pretty
regular
for
the
last
few
weeks
but
i
know
his
name
either
have
you
heard
of
the
murder
in
lonsdale
passage
asked
viner
markendale
square
way
yes
answered
the
landlord
with
awakening
interest
why
is
it
anything
to
do
viner
saw
an
illustrated
paper
lying
on
a
and
caught
it
up
there
was
a
portrait
of
ashton
in
it
and
he
held
it
up
before
the
landlord
do
you
recognize
that
he
asked
the
landlord
started
and
stared
bless
my
life
and
soul
he
exclaimed
why
surely
that
very
like
the
gentleman
i
just
referred
to
i
should
say
it
was
the
very
man
it
is
the
very
man
said
viner
with
emphasis
the
man
for
whom
your
customer
who
just
gone
out
left
the
envelope
now
this
man
who
was
murdered
in
lonsdale
passage
was
here
in
your
parlour
for
some
time
on
the
evening
of
the
night
on
which
he
was
murdered
and
he
was
then
in
conversation
with
the
man
who
has
just
gone
out
naturally
therefore
i
should
like
to
know
that
man
name
you
not
a
detective
suggested
the
landlord
not
at
all
replied
viner
i
was
a
neighbour
of
ashton
and
i
am
interested
deeply
interested
in
an
attempt
to
clear
up
the
mystery
of
his
death
things
keep
coming
out
i
did
know
until
this
evening
that
ashton
spent
some
time
here
at
your
house
the
night
he
was
killed
but
when
i
got
to
know
i
came
along
to
make
one
or
two
inquiries
bless
me
said
the
landlord
who
was
still
staring
at
the
portrait
yes
that
the
gentleman
sure
enough
i
often
wondered
who
he
was
pleasant
sociable
sort
he
was
poor
fellow
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
i
remember
him
being
in
here
that
night
last
time
of
course
he
was
ever
in
he
was
talking
to
that
gentleman
who
just
gone
in
fact
they
left
together
they
left
together
did
they
exclaimed
viner
with
a
sharp
glance
at
barleyfield
ah
what
time
was
that
now
as
near
as
i
can
recollect
about
to
answered
the
landlord
they
been
talking
together
for
a
good
hour
in
that
corner
where
they
usually
sat
but
dear
me
he
went
on
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
two
visitors
i
quite
sure
that
gentleman
just
left
does
know
of
this
murder
why
you
heard
him
ask
for
the
other
gentleman
and
leave
him
some
cigars
that
he
promised
just
so
which
makes
it
all
the
stranger
said
viner
well
i
much
obliged
to
you
landlord
and
for
the
time
being
just
keep
the
matter
of
this
talk
strictly
to
yourself
you
understand
as
you
wish
sir
assented
the
landlord
i
sha
say
anything
you
would
like
me
to
find
out
this
gentleman
name
somebody
know
him
my
own
idea
is
that
he
lives
in
this
part
he
began
coming
in
here
of
an
evening
about
a
year
since
no
do
nothing
at
present
said
viner
the
inquiries
are
only
beginning
he
impressed
the
same
obligation
of
silence
on
barleyfield
as
they
went
away
and
the
florist
readily
understood
no
hard
work
for
me
to
hold
my
tongue
viner
he
said
we
tradespeople
are
pretty
well
trained
to
that
sir
there
things
and
secrets
i
could
tell
but
upon
my
word
i
do
ever
remember
quite
such
a
case
as
this
and
i
expect
it
be
like
most
cases
of
the
sort
what
do
you
mean
asked
viner
oh
there
be
a
sudden
flash
of
light
on
it
sir
all
of
a
sudden
replied
barleyfield
and
then
it
be
as
clear
as
noonday
i
do
know
where
it
coming
from
muttered
viner
i
do
even
see
a
rift
in
the
clouds
yet
he
had
been
at
work
for
an
hour
or
two
with
miss
wickham
and
pawle
next
morning
searching
for
whatever
might
be
discovered
among
effects
before
he
saw
any
reason
to
alter
this
opinion
the
bunch
of
keys
discovered
in
the
murdered
man
pocket
had
been
duly
delivered
to
miss
wickham
by
the
police
and
she
handed
them
over
to
the
old
solicitor
with
full
license
to
open
whatever
they
secured
but
both
pawle
and
viner
saw
at
once
that
ashton
had
been
one
of
those
men
who
have
no
habit
of
locking
up
things
in
all
that
roomy
house
he
had
but
one
room
which
he
kept
to
himself
a
small
apartment
on
the
ground
floor
in
which
they
said
he
used
to
spend
an
hour
or
two
of
a
morning
it
contained
little
in
the
way
of
ornament
or
comfort
a
solid
with
a
hard
chair
an
by
the
fireplace
a
sofa
against
the
wall
a
map
of
london
and
a
picture
or
two
a
shelf
of
old
books
a
collection
of
and
umbrellas
these
made
up
all
there
was
to
see
and
upon
examination
the
desk
yielded
next
to
nothing
one
drawer
contained
a
a
checkbook
a
some
sixty
or
seventy
pounds
in
notes
gold
and
silver
lay
in
the
the
stubs
of
the
checks
revealed
nothing
but
the
payment
of
tradesmen
bills
the
showed
that
an
enormous
balance
lay
at
the
bank
in
another
drawer
rested
a
collection
of
tradesmen
books
ashton
said
killenhall
used
to
pay
his
tradesmen
every
week
these
books
had
been
handed
to
him
on
the
very
evening
of
his
death
for
settlement
next
morning
evidently
a
most
methodical
man
remarked
pawle
which
makes
it
all
the
more
remarkable
that
so
few
papers
are
discoverable
you
have
thought
that
in
his
longish
life
he
have
accumulated
a
good
many
documents
that
he
wanted
to
keep
but
documents
there
were
next
to
none
several
of
the
drawers
of
the
desk
were
empty
save
for
stationery
one
contained
a
bunch
of
letters
tied
up
with
blue
ribbon
these
on
examination
proved
to
be
letters
written
by
miss
wickham
at
school
in
england
to
her
guardian
in
australia
miss
wickham
present
while
pawle
and
viner
searched
showed
some
emotion
at
the
sight
of
them
i
used
to
write
to
him
once
a
month
she
said
i
had
no
idea
that
he
had
kept
the
letters
though
the
two
men
went
silently
on
with
their
search
but
there
was
no
further
result
ashton
did
not
appear
to
have
kept
any
letters
or
papers
relative
to
his
life
or
doings
prior
to
his
coming
to
england
private
documents
of
any
sort
he
seemed
to
have
none
and
whatever
business
had
taken
him
to
marketstoke
they
could
find
no
written
reference
to
it
nor
could
they
discover
anything
about
the
diamond
of
which
van
hoeren
had
spoken
they
went
upstairs
to
his
bedroom
and
examined
the
drawers
cabinets
and
they
found
nothing
this
is
distinctly
disappointing
remarked
pawle
when
he
and
viner
returned
to
the
little
room
i
never
knew
a
man
who
left
such
small
evidence
behind
him
it
quite
evident
to
me
that
there
nothing
whatever
in
this
house
that
going
to
be
of
any
use
to
us
i
wonder
if
he
rented
a
box
at
any
of
the
places
he
must
have
had
documents
of
some
sort
in
that
case
we
should
surely
have
found
a
key
and
perhaps
a
receipt
for
the
rent
of
the
box
suggested
viner
i
should
have
thought
have
had
a
safe
in
his
own
house
he
added
but
we
do
hear
of
one
pawle
looked
round
the
room
as
if
suspicious
that
ashton
might
have
hidden
papers
in
the
stuffing
of
the
sofa
or
the
i
wonder
if
there
anything
in
that
he
said
suddenly
it
looks
like
a
receptacle
of
some
sort
viner
turned
and
saw
the
old
lawyer
pointing
to
a
curious
japanese
cabinet
which
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
marble
mantelpiece
the
only
really
notable
ornament
in
the
room
pawle
laid
hold
of
it
and
uttered
a
surprised
exclamation
that
a
tremendous
weight
for
so
small
a
thing
he
said
feel
it
viner
took
hold
of
the
cabinet
an
affair
of
some
eighteen
inches
in
height
and
twelve
in
depth
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
it
was
heavily
weighted
with
lead
he
lifted
it
down
to
the
desk
giving
it
a
slight
shake
i
took
it
for
a
cigar
cabinet
he
remarked
how
does
it
open
have
you
a
key
that
will
fit
it
but
upon
examination
there
was
no
keyhole
and
nothing
to
show
how
the
door
was
opened
i
see
what
this
is
said
viner
after
looking
closely
over
the
cabinet
back
front
and
sides
it
opens
by
a
trick
a
secret
probably
you
press
something
somewhere
and
the
door
flies
open
but
where
try
counselled
pawle
there
something
inside
i
heard
it
when
you
shook
the
thing
it
took
viner
ten
minutes
to
find
out
the
secret
he
would
not
have
found
it
at
all
but
for
accident
but
pressing
here
and
pulling
there
he
suddenly
touched
what
appeared
to
be
no
more
than
a
cleverly
inserted
rivet
in
the
ebony
surface
there
was
a
sharp
click
and
the
panelled
front
flew
open
there
is
something
exclaimed
pawle
papers
he
drew
out
a
bundle
of
papers
folded
in
a
strong
sheet
of
and
sealed
back
and
front
the
enveloping
cover
was
old
and
faded
the
ribbon
which
had
been
tied
round
the
bundle
was
discoloured
by
age
the
wax
of
the
seals
was
cracked
all
over
the
surface
no
inscription
no
writing
said
pawle
now
i
wonder
what
in
here
shall
i
fetch
miss
wickham
suggested
viner
pawle
hesitated
no
he
said
at
last
i
think
not
let
us
first
find
out
what
this
packet
contains
i
take
the
responsibility
he
cut
the
ribbons
beneath
the
seals
and
presently
revealed
a
number
of
letters
old
and
yellow
in
a
woman
handwriting
and
after
a
hasty
glance
at
one
or
two
of
the
uppermost
he
turned
to
viner
with
an
exclamation
that
signified
much
viner
he
said
here
is
indeed
a
find
these
are
letters
written
by
the
countess
of
ellingham
to
her
son
lord
marketstoke
when
he
was
a
schoolboy
at
eton
chapter
xiv
the
ellingham
motto
viner
looked
over
pawle
shoulder
at
the
letters
there
were
numbers
of
them
all
neatly
folded
and
arranged
a
faint
scent
of
dried
flowers
rose
from
them
as
the
old
lawyer
spread
them
out
on
the
desk
which
countess
of
ellingham
and
which
lord
marketstoke
asked
viner
there
have
been
must
have
been
several
during
the
last
century
the
lord
marketstoke
i
mean
is
the
one
who
disappeared
answered
pawle
we
no
concern
with
any
other
look
at
these
dates
we
know
that
if
he
were
living
he
would
now
be
a
man
of
or
so
therefore
he
be
at
school
about
years
ago
now
look
here
he
went
on
rapidly
turning
the
letters
over
compare
these
dates
they
run
through
two
or
three
years
they
were
all
of
to
years
since
you
see
how
they
signed
you
see
how
they
addressed
there
no
doubt
about
it
viner
this
is
a
collection
of
letters
written
by
the
seventh
countess
of
ellingham
to
her
elder
son
lord
marketstoke
when
he
was
at
eton
how
came
they
into
ashton
possession
i
wonder
asked
viner
it
all
of
a
piece
exclaimed
pawle
all
of
a
piece
with
ashton
visit
to
marketstoke
all
of
a
piece
with
the
facts
that
avice
was
a
favourite
name
with
the
family
and
that
one
of
the
holders
of
the
title
married
a
wickham
viner
there
no
doubt
whatever
in
my
mind
that
either
ashton
was
lord
marketstoke
or
that
he
knew
the
man
who
was
you
remember
what
armitstead
told
us
remarked
viner
that
ashton
told
him
in
paris
that
he
ashton
hailed
from
lancashire
then
he
knew
the
missing
man
and
got
these
papers
from
him
declared
the
old
lawyer
but
why
ah
now
i
have
an
idea
it
may
be
that
marketstoke
dying
out
there
in
australia
handed
these
things
to
ashton
and
asked
him
to
give
them
to
some
members
of
the
family
perhaps
an
aunt
or
a
cousin
or
so
on
and
that
ashton
went
down
to
marketstoke
to
find
out
what
relations
were
still
in
existence
that
may
be
it
that
would
solve
the
problem
no
said
viner
with
sudden
emphasis
he
made
sure
that
the
door
of
the
little
room
was
closed
and
then
went
up
to
the
old
lawyer
elbow
is
that
really
all
you
can
think
of
he
asked
with
a
keen
glance
as
for
me
why
i
thinking
of
something
that
seems
absolutely
obvious
what
then
demanded
pawle
tell
me
viner
pointed
towards
the
door
have
we
heard
already
that
a
man
named
wickham
handed
over
his
daughter
avice
to
ashton
care
and
guardianship
he
asked
that
seem
to
be
an
established
fact
no
doubt
of
it
assented
pawle
well
in
my
opinion
said
viner
quietly
wickham
was
the
missing
lord
of
marketstoke
pawle
who
was
still
turning
over
the
letters
examining
their
dates
let
them
slip
out
of
his
hands
and
gasped
by
george
he
exclaimed
in
a
wondering
voice
it
may
be
possibly
is
then
in
that
case
that
girl
outside
there
well
asked
viner
after
a
pause
pawle
made
a
puzzled
gesture
and
shook
his
head
as
if
in
amazement
in
that
case
if
wickham
was
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
and
this
girl
is
his
daughter
she
he
broke
off
and
became
still
more
puzzled
upon
my
honour
he
exclaimed
i
do
know
who
she
is
what
do
you
mean
asked
viner
she
his
daughter
of
course
wickham
only
in
that
case
i
mean
if
he
was
really
lord
marketstoke
her
proper
name
i
suppose
is
pawle
looked
his
young
assistant
over
with
an
amused
expression
you
have
the
old
practitioner
viner
my
boy
he
said
when
one
got
to
my
age
and
seen
a
number
of
queer
things
and
happenings
one
quick
to
see
possible
cases
look
here
if
wickham
was
really
lord
marketstoke
and
that
girl
across
the
hall
is
his
daughter
she
probably
i
say
probably
for
i
do
know
if
the
succession
in
this
case
goes
with
the
female
line
countess
of
ellingham
in
her
own
right
viner
looked
his
surprise
is
that
really
so
would
it
be
so
he
asked
it
may
be
i
not
sure
replied
pawle
as
i
say
i
do
know
how
the
succession
runs
in
this
particular
instance
there
are
as
you
are
aware
several
peeresses
in
their
own
rights
or
five
at
least
some
are
very
ancient
peerages
i
know
that
three
furnivale
and
fauconberg
and
conyers
go
right
back
to
the
thirteenth
century
three
others
beaumont
darcy
da
knayth
and
zorch
of
haryngworth
date
from
the
fourteenth
i
not
sure
of
this
ellingham
peerage
but
i
find
out
when
i
get
back
to
my
office
however
granting
the
premises
and
if
the
peerage
does
continue
in
the
female
line
it
will
be
as
i
say
this
girl
the
rightful
holder
of
the
title
viner
made
no
immediate
answer
and
pawle
began
to
put
up
the
letters
in
their
original
wrappings
regular
romance
is
it
if
it
is
so
he
exclaimed
extraordinary
shall
you
tell
her
asked
viner
pawle
considered
the
direct
question
while
he
completed
his
task
no
he
said
at
last
not
at
present
she
evidently
knows
nothing
and
she
better
be
left
in
complete
ignorance
for
a
while
you
see
viner
as
i
pointed
out
to
you
several
times
there
is
a
paper
or
a
document
of
any
description
extant
which
refers
to
her
nothing
in
my
hands
nothing
in
the
banker
hands
nothing
here
and
yet
supposing
her
father
wickham
to
have
been
lord
marketstoke
and
to
have
entrusted
his
secret
to
ashton
at
the
same
time
that
he
gave
him
the
guardianship
of
his
daughter
he
must
have
given
ashton
papers
to
prove
his
and
her
identity
must
where
are
they
do
you
know
what
i
think
said
viner
i
think
if
i
to
put
it
in
plain
language
that
ashton
carried
those
papers
on
him
and
that
he
was
murdered
for
the
possession
of
them
pawle
nodded
and
put
the
packet
of
letters
in
his
pocket
i
should
be
surprised
he
answered
it
a
very
probable
theory
my
boy
but
it
presupposes
one
thing
and
makes
one
horribly
suspicious
of
another
yes
inquired
viner
it
presupposes
that
ashton
let
somebody
into
the
secret
replied
pawle
and
it
makes
one
suspect
that
the
person
to
whom
he
did
reveal
it
had
such
personal
interest
in
suppressing
it
that
he
went
to
the
length
of
murdering
ashton
before
ashton
could
tell
it
to
any
one
else
how
does
that
strike
you
viner
it
this
and
not
the
diamond
declared
viner
doggedly
i
a
sort
of
absolute
intuition
that
i
right
i
think
so
too
assented
the
old
lawyer
dryly
the
diamond
is
a
very
well
now
we
know
a
lot
you
and
i
and
we
going
to
solve
matters
and
we
not
going
to
say
a
word
to
this
young
lady
at
present
that
settled
but
i
want
to
ask
her
some
questions
come
along
he
led
the
way
across
the
hall
to
the
where
a
reminder
of
ashton
death
met
his
and
viner
view
as
soon
as
they
had
crossed
the
threshold
the
funeral
was
to
take
place
next
day
and
killenhall
and
miss
wickham
were
contemplating
a
massive
wreath
of
flowers
which
had
evidently
just
arrived
from
the
florist
and
been
deposited
on
the
all
we
can
do
for
him
you
know
murmured
killenhall
with
a
glance
at
the
two
men
he
he
had
so
few
friends
here
poor
man
that
remark
observed
pawle
is
apropos
of
a
subject
that
i
want
to
ask
miss
wickham
two
or
three
questions
about
friends
now
miss
wickham
you
always
understood
that
ashton
and
your
father
were
very
close
friends
i
believe
i
always
understood
so
yes
pawle
replied
miss
wickham
did
he
ever
tell
you
much
about
your
father
no
very
little
indeed
he
never
told
me
more
than
that
they
knew
each
other
very
well
in
australia
that
my
father
died
out
there
comparatively
young
and
that
he
left
me
in
his
ashton
care
did
he
ever
tell
you
whether
your
father
left
you
any
money
demanded
the
old
lawyer
miss
wickham
looked
surprised
oh
yes
she
answered
i
thought
you
know
that
my
father
left
me
a
good
deal
of
money
did
ashton
tell
you
never
a
word
said
pawle
now
where
is
it
then
in
my
bank
replied
miss
wickham
promptly
the
london
and
universal
when
ashton
fetched
me
away
from
school
and
brought
me
here
he
told
me
that
he
had
twelve
thousand
pounds
of
mine
which
my
father
had
left
me
and
he
handed
it
over
to
me
then
and
there
and
took
me
to
the
london
and
universal
bank
where
i
opened
an
account
with
it
spent
any
of
it
asked
pawle
dryly
only
a
few
pounds
answered
miss
wickham
the
old
solicitor
glanced
at
viner
who
while
these
private
matters
were
being
inquired
into
was
affecting
to
examine
the
pictures
on
the
walls
most
extraordinary
he
muttered
all
this
convinces
me
that
ashton
must
have
had
papers
and
documents
these
must
have
been
however
we
do
know
where
they
are
but
there
would
surely
be
for
instance
your
father
will
miss
wickham
i
suppose
you
never
seen
such
a
document
no
to
be
sure
you
left
all
to
ashton
well
now
do
you
remember
your
father
only
just
and
very
faintly
pawle
replied
miss
wickham
you
must
remember
i
was
little
more
than
five
years
old
can
you
remember
what
he
was
like
i
think
he
was
a
big
tall
man
but
it
a
mere
impression
listen
said
pawle
did
you
ever
at
any
time
hear
ashton
make
any
reference
i
talking
now
of
the
last
few
weeks
to
the
ellingham
family
or
to
the
earl
of
ellingham
never
replied
miss
wickham
never
heard
of
them
he
never
killenhall
was
showing
signs
of
a
wish
to
speak
and
pawle
turned
to
her
have
you
he
asked
yes
said
killenhall
i
have
it
was
one
night
when
miss
wickham
was
out
you
were
at
my
dear
and
ashton
and
i
dined
alone
he
asked
me
if
i
remembered
the
famous
ellingham
case
some
years
ago
something
about
the
succession
to
the
title
he
said
read
it
in
the
colonial
papers
of
course
i
remembered
it
very
well
well
said
pawle
and
what
then
i
think
that
was
all
answered
killenhall
he
merely
remarked
that
it
was
an
odd
case
and
said
no
more
what
made
him
mention
it
asked
pawle
oh
we
been
talking
about
romances
of
the
peerage
replied
killenhall
i
had
told
him
of
several
you
well
up
in
the
peerage
suggested
the
old
lawyer
i
know
my
burke
and
my
debrett
pretty
thoroughly
said
killenhall
very
interesting
of
course
pawle
who
was
sitting
close
to
miss
wickham
suddenly
pointed
to
a
gold
locket
which
she
wore
where
did
you
get
that
my
dear
he
asked
unusual
device
is
it
ashton
gave
it
to
me
a
few
weeks
ago
answered
miss
wickham
he
said
it
had
belonged
to
my
father
the
old
lawyer
bent
nearer
looked
more
closely
at
the
locket
and
got
up
elegant
old
thing
he
said
not
made
yesterday
that
well
ladies
you
will
see
me
for
this
very
sad
occasion
he
waved
a
hand
at
the
wreath
of
flowers
tomorrow
in
the
meantime
if
there
is
anything
you
want
done
our
young
friend
here
is
close
at
hand
just
now
however
i
want
him
viner
observed
pawle
when
they
had
left
the
house
it
very
odd
how
unobservant
some
people
are
now
there
that
woman
we
just
left
killenhall
who
says
that
she
well
up
in
her
debrett
and
her
burke
and
there
seen
by
her
many
a
time
is
that
locket
which
miss
wickham
is
wearing
and
she
never
noticed
it
never
i
mean
noticed
what
on
it
why
i
saw
it
and
its
significance
instantly
just
now
which
was
the
first
time
i
seen
it
what
is
it
that
on
it
asked
viner
after
we
came
back
from
marketstoke
replied
pawle
i
looked
up
the
family
and
their
peerage
that
locket
bears
their
device
and
motto
the
device
is
a
closed
fist
grasping
a
handful
of
blades
of
wheat
the
motto
is
and
viner
as
sure
as
fate
that
father
was
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
and
ashton
knew
the
secret
convinced
of
it
i
positive
of
it
and
now
see
the
extraordinary
position
in
which
we
all
placed
ashton
dead
and
there
is
one
scrap
of
paper
to
show
what
it
was
that
he
really
knew
nothing
not
one
written
line
because
as
i
said
before
he
was
murdered
for
his
papers
affirmed
viner
i
sure
of
that
as
you
are
of
the
rest
i
dare
say
you
right
agreed
pawle
but
as
said
before
that
presupposes
that
ashton
told
somebody
the
secret
now
who
was
it
the
man
he
was
with
in
paris
and
if
so
who
is
that
man
but
it
useless
speculating
i
made
up
my
mind
to
a
certain
course
viner
tomorrow
after
the
funeral
i
going
to
call
on
the
present
lord
ellingham
his
town
house
is
in
hertford
street
and
i
know
he
in
town
and
ask
him
if
he
has
heard
anything
of
a
mysterious
nature
relating
to
his
uncle
we
may
hear
something
you
come
with
me
next
day
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
pawle
and
viner
got
out
of
a
taxicab
in
park
lane
and
walked
down
hertford
street
the
old
lawyer
explaining
the
course
he
was
about
to
take
this
is
a
young
man
not
long
come
of
age
he
said
he
be
quite
well
acquainted
however
with
the
family
history
and
if
happened
lately
i
dare
say
i
can
get
him
to
talk
he
what
is
it
viner
had
suddenly
gripped
his
companion
arm
and
pulled
him
to
a
halt
he
was
looking
ahead
at
the
house
at
which
they
were
about
to
call
and
there
just
being
shown
out
by
a
footman
was
the
man
whom
he
had
seen
at
the
tavern
in
notting
hill
and
with
him
a
tall
man
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
chapter
xv
the
present
holder
pawle
turned
sharply
on
his
companion
as
viner
pulled
him
up
he
saw
the
direction
of
viner
suddenly
arrested
gaze
and
looked
from
him
to
the
two
men
who
had
now
walked
down
the
steps
of
the
house
and
were
advancing
towards
them
what
is
it
he
asked
those
fellows
are
coming
away
from
lord
ellingham
house
you
seem
to
know
them
one
of
them
murmured
viner
the
man
look
at
him
the
two
men
came
on
in
close
evidently
absorbed
conversation
passed
pawle
and
viner
without
as
much
as
a
glance
at
them
and
went
along
in
the
direction
of
park
lane
well
demanded
pawle
the
man
is
the
man
i
told
you
of
the
man
who
was
in
conversation
with
ashton
at
that
tavern
in
notting
hill
the
night
ashton
was
murdered
answered
viner
the
other
man
i
do
know
pawle
turned
and
looked
after
the
retreating
figures
you
sure
of
that
he
asked
certain
replied
viner
i
should
know
him
anywhere
pawle
came
to
another
halt
glancing
first
at
the
two
men
now
well
up
the
street
and
then
at
the
somewhat
sombre
front
of
ellingham
house
now
this
is
an
extraordinary
thing
viner
he
exclaimed
there
the
man
who
you
say
was
with
ashton
not
very
long
before
he
came
to
his
end
and
we
find
him
coming
away
presumably
from
lord
ellingham
certainly
from
lord
ellingham
house
what
on
earth
does
it
mean
and
i
wonder
who
the
man
is
what
i
like
to
know
said
viner
is
who
is
the
other
man
but
as
you
say
it
is
certainly
a
very
curious
thing
that
we
should
find
the
first
man
evidently
in
touch
with
lord
ellingham
considering
our
recent
discoveries
but
what
are
you
going
to
do
going
in
here
affirmed
pawle
to
the
we
may
get
to
know
something
have
you
a
card
the
footman
who
took
the
cards
looked
doubtfully
at
them
and
their
presenters
his
lordship
is
just
going
out
he
said
glancing
over
his
shoulder
i
do
know
pawle
pointed
to
the
name
of
his
firm
at
the
corner
of
his
card
i
think
lord
ellingham
will
see
me
he
said
tell
his
lordship
i
shall
not
detain
him
many
minutes
if
he
will
be
kind
enough
to
give
me
an
interview
the
man
went
away
to
return
in
a
few
minutes
and
to
lead
the
callers
into
a
room
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
wherein
his
back
to
the
fire
his
look
and
attitude
one
of
puzzled
surprise
stood
a
very
young
man
dressed
in
the
height
of
fashion
who
as
his
servant
had
said
was
obviously
just
ready
to
go
out
viner
remembering
what
had
brought
him
and
pawle
there
looked
at
lord
ellingham
closely
he
seemed
to
be
frank
ingenuous
and
decidedly
youthful
but
there
was
something
decidedly
practical
and
in
his
greeting
of
his
visitors
i
afraid
i
ca
give
you
very
long
pawle
he
said
glancing
instinctively
at
the
old
lawyer
i
a
most
important
engagement
in
half
an
hour
and
it
wo
be
put
off
but
i
can
give
you
ten
minutes
i
am
deeply
obliged
to
your
lordship
answered
pawle
as
your
lordship
will
have
seen
from
my
card
i
am
one
of
the
partners
in
crawle
pawle
and
rattenbury
a
firm
not
at
all
unknown
i
think
allow
me
to
introduce
my
friend
viner
a
gentlemen
who
is
deeply
concerned
and
interested
in
the
matter
i
want
to
mention
to
your
lordship
lord
ellingham
responded
politely
to
viner
bow
and
drew
two
chairs
forward
sit
down
pawle
sit
down
viner
he
said
he
dropped
into
a
chair
near
a
desk
which
stood
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
looked
interrogatively
at
his
elder
visitor
have
you
some
business
to
discuss
mr
pawle
he
asked
some
business
my
lord
which
i
confess
at
once
is
of
extraordinary
nature
answered
the
old
lawyer
i
will
go
straight
to
it
your
lordship
has
doubtless
read
in
the
newspapers
of
the
murder
of
a
man
named
ashton
in
lonsdale
passage
in
the
bayswater
district
lord
ellingham
glanced
at
a
pile
of
newspapers
which
lay
on
a
yes
he
answered
i
have
i
been
much
interested
in
it
as
a
murder
a
curious
and
mysterious
case
do
you
think
we
replied
pawle
waving
a
hand
toward
viner
know
it
to
be
a
much
more
mysterious
case
than
anybody
could
gather
from
the
newspaper
accounts
for
they
know
little
who
have
written
them
and
we
who
are
behind
the
scenes
know
a
great
deal
now
your
lordship
will
have
seen
that
a
young
man
an
actor
named
langton
hyde
has
been
arrested
and
charged
and
is
on
remand
this
unfortunate
fellow
was
an
old
schoolmate
of
viner
they
were
at
rugby
together
and
viner
and
i
may
say
i
myself
also
is
convinced
beyond
doubt
of
his
entire
innocence
and
we
want
to
clear
him
we
are
doing
all
we
can
to
clear
him
and
it
is
because
of
this
that
we
have
ventured
to
call
on
your
lordship
oh
exclaimed
lord
ellingham
but
what
can
i
do
how
do
i
come
in
my
lord
said
pawle
in
his
most
solemn
manner
i
will
go
straight
to
this
point
also
we
have
reason
to
feel
sure
from
undoubted
evidence
that
john
ashton
a
very
wealthy
man
who
had
recently
come
from
australia
where
he
had
lived
for
a
great
many
years
to
settle
here
in
london
had
in
his
possession
when
he
was
murdered
certain
highly
important
papers
relating
to
your
lordship
family
and
that
he
was
murdered
for
the
sake
of
them
the
puzzled
expression
which
viner
had
noted
in
lord
ellingham
boyish
face
when
they
entered
the
room
grew
more
and
more
marked
as
pawle
proceeded
and
he
turned
on
the
old
lawyer
at
the
end
with
a
stare
of
amazement
you
really
think
that
he
exclaimed
i
shall
be
very
much
surprised
if
i
not
right
declared
pawle
but
what
papers
asked
lord
ellingham
and
what
how
could
this
ashton
who
you
say
came
from
australia
be
in
possession
of
papers
relating
to
my
family
i
never
heard
of
him
your
lordship
said
pawle
is
doubtless
well
aware
that
some
years
ago
there
was
a
very
strange
shall
we
call
it
romance
in
your
family
a
very
remarkable
episode
anyway
a
most
unusual
you
mean
the
strange
disappearance
of
my
uncle
this
lord
marketstoke
interrupted
lord
ellingham
with
a
smile
oh
of
course
i
know
all
about
that
very
well
my
lord
continued
pawle
then
your
lordship
is
aware
that
lord
marketstoke
was
believed
to
have
gone
to
the
colonies
australia
or
new
zealand
and
was
lost
there
his
death
was
presumed
now
ashton
came
from
australia
and
as
i
say
we
believe
him
to
have
brought
with
him
certain
highly
important
papers
relative
to
lord
marketstoke
whom
we
think
to
have
been
well
known
to
him
at
one
time
indeed
we
felt
sure
that
ashton
knew
lord
marketstoke
secret
now
my
lord
we
are
also
confident
that
whoever
killed
john
ashton
did
so
in
order
to
get
hold
of
certain
papers
which
i
feel
certain
ashton
made
a
habit
of
carrying
on
his
person
papers
relating
to
his
friend
lord
marketstoke
identity
lord
ellingham
remained
silent
for
a
moment
looking
from
one
visitor
to
another
it
was
very
clear
to
viner
that
some
train
of
thought
had
been
aroused
in
him
and
that
he
was
closely
pursuing
it
he
fixed
his
gaze
at
last
on
the
old
lawyer
pawle
he
said
quietly
have
you
any
proof
undoubted
proof
that
ashton
did
possess
papers
relating
to
my
uncle
yes
answered
pawle
i
have
he
pulled
out
the
bundle
of
letters
which
he
and
viner
had
unearthed
from
the
japanese
cabinet
this
it
is
a
packet
of
letters
written
by
the
seventh
countess
of
ellingham
to
her
elder
son
the
lord
marketstoke
we
are
talking
of
when
he
was
a
boy
at
eton
your
lordship
will
probably
recognize
your
handwriting
lord
ellingham
bent
over
the
letter
which
pawle
spread
before
him
yes
he
said
i
know
the
writing
quite
well
and
these
were
in
ashton
possession
we
have
just
found
them
viner
and
i
in
a
cabinet
in
his
house
replied
pawle
they
are
the
only
papers
we
have
so
far
been
able
to
bring
to
light
but
as
i
have
said
we
are
convinced
there
were
others
much
more
important
ones
in
his
possession
probably
in
his
pocketbook
lord
ellingham
handed
the
letters
back
you
think
that
this
ashton
was
in
possession
of
a
secret
relating
to
the
missing
man
my
uncle
lord
marketstoke
he
asked
i
am
convinced
of
it
declared
pawle
lord
ellingham
glanced
shrewdly
at
his
visitors
i
should
like
to
know
what
it
was
he
said
your
lordship
feels
as
i
do
remarked
pawle
but
now
i
should
like
to
ask
a
question
which
arises
out
of
this
visit
as
we
approached
your
lordship
door
just
now
we
saw
leaving
it
two
men
one
of
them
my
friend
viner
immediately
recognized
he
does
not
know
who
the
man
is
which
of
the
two
men
do
you
mean
interrupted
lord
ellingham
i
may
as
well
say
that
they
had
just
left
me
the
man
answered
viner
whom
viner
knows
for
a
fact
continued
pawle
to
have
been
in
ashton
company
only
an
hour
or
so
before
ashton
murder
lord
ellingham
looked
at
viner
in
obvious
surprise
but
you
do
not
know
who
he
is
he
exclaimed
no
replied
viner
i
do
but
there
is
no
doubt
of
the
truth
of
what
pawle
has
just
said
this
man
was
certainly
with
ashton
at
a
tavern
in
notting
hill
from
about
to
on
the
evening
of
ashton
death
in
fact
they
left
the
tavern
together
the
young
nobleman
suddenly
pulled
open
a
drawer
in
his
desk
produced
a
box
of
cigarettes
and
silently
offered
it
to
his
visitors
he
lighted
a
cigarette
himself
and
for
a
moment
smoked
in
silence
it
seemed
to
viner
that
his
youthful
face
had
grown
unusually
grave
and
thoughtful
pawle
he
said
at
last
i
immensely
surprised
by
what
told
me
and
all
the
more
so
because
this
is
the
second
surprise
i
had
this
afternoon
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
the
two
gentlemen
whom
you
saw
going
away
just
now
brought
me
some
very
astonishing
news
yours
comes
right
on
top
of
it
and
if
you
please
i
rather
not
say
any
more
about
it
just
now
but
i
going
to
make
a
proposal
to
you
will
you
and
viner
if
he
be
so
good
meet
me
tomorrow
morning
say
at
noon
at
my
solicitors
offices
with
pleasure
responded
pawle
your
lordship
solicitors
are
carless
and
driver
lincoln
inn
fields
answered
lord
ellingham
friends
of
ours
said
pawle
we
will
meet
your
lordship
there
at
twelve
o
to
the
minute
and
you
bring
that
with
you
suggested
lord
ellingham
pointing
to
the
packet
of
letters
which
pawle
held
in
his
hand
just
so
my
lord
assented
pawle
and
we
be
ready
to
tell
all
we
know
for
there
are
further
details
outside
the
house
the
old
lawyer
gripped
viner
elbow
that
boy
knows
something
he
said
with
a
meaning
smile
he
astute
enough
for
his
age
smart
youngster
but
what
does
he
know
those
two
men
have
told
him
something
viner
we
must
find
out
who
that
man
is
i
have
some
idea
that
i
have
seen
him
before
i
should
be
at
all
surprised
if
he
a
solicitor
may
have
seen
him
in
some
court
or
other
but
in
that
case
i
wonder
he
did
recognize
me
he
did
look
at
you
replied
viner
he
and
the
other
man
were
too
much
absorbed
in
whatever
it
was
they
were
talking
about
i
have
been
wondering
since
i
first
saw
him
at
the
tavern
he
continued
if
i
ought
not
to
tell
the
police
what
i
know
about
him
i
mean
that
he
was
certainly
in
ashton
company
on
the
evening
of
the
murder
what
do
you
think
i
think
not
at
present
replied
pawle
it
seems
evident
unless
indeed
it
was
all
a
piece
of
bluff
and
it
may
have
been
that
this
man
is
or
was
when
you
saw
him
just
as
ignorant
as
the
landlord
of
that
place
was
that
the
man
who
used
to
drop
in
there
and
ashton
were
one
and
the
same
person
no
let
the
police
go
on
their
own
lines
we
on
others
we
shall
hear
of
this
man
again
whoever
he
is
now
i
must
get
back
to
my
office
come
there
at
eleven
tomorrow
morning
viner
and
we
go
on
to
carless
and
driver
viner
went
thoughtfully
homeward
ruminating
over
the
events
of
the
day
and
entered
his
house
to
find
his
two
guests
the
sisters
of
the
unlucky
hyde
in
floods
of
tears
and
miss
penkridge
looking
unusually
grave
the
elder
miss
hyde
sprang
up
at
sight
of
him
and
held
a
handkerchief
towards
him
in
pantomimic
appeal
oh
viner
she
exclaimed
you
are
so
kind
and
so
clever
i
sure
you
see
a
way
out
of
this
it
looks
oh
so
very
black
and
so
very
much
against
him
but
oh
dear
viner
there
must
be
some
explanation
but
what
is
it
asked
viner
looking
from
one
to
the
other
what
has
happened
has
any
one
been
here
miss
penkridge
silently
handed
to
her
nephew
an
early
edition
of
one
of
the
evening
newspapers
and
pointed
to
a
paragraph
in
large
type
and
viner
rapidly
read
it
over
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
younger
miss
hyde
sobs
a
sensational
discovery
in
connection
with
the
recent
murder
of
ashton
in
lonsdale
passage
bayswater
was
made
in
the
early
hours
of
this
morning
charles
fisher
a
greengrocer
carrying
on
business
in
the
harrow
road
found
in
his
woodshed
concealed
in
a
nook
in
the
wall
a
parcel
containing
ashton
gold
watch
and
chain
and
a
diamond
ring
he
immediately
communicated
with
the
police
and
these
valuables
are
now
in
their
possession
it
will
be
remembered
that
langton
hyde
the
young
actor
who
is
charged
with
the
crime
and
who
is
now
on
remand
stated
at
the
coroner
inquest
that
he
passed
the
night
on
which
the
crime
was
committed
in
a
shed
in
this
neighbourhood
viner
read
this
news
twice
over
then
a
sudden
idea
occurred
to
him
and
he
turned
to
leave
the
room
i
do
think
you
need
be
particularly
alarmed
about
this
he
said
to
the
weeping
sisters
cheer
up
till
i
return
i
am
going
round
to
the
police
chapter
xvi
the
outhouse
near
the
viner
fell
in
with
his
solicitor
felpham
who
turned
a
corner
in
a
great
hurry
felpham
first
glance
showed
his
client
that
their
purposes
were
in
common
seen
that
paragraph
in
the
evening
papers
said
felpham
without
preface
by
george
that
serious
news
what
a
pity
that
hyde
ever
made
that
statement
about
his
doings
on
the
night
of
the
murder
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
he
held
his
tongue
altogether
he
insisted
on
it
in
the
end
answered
viner
and
in
my
opinion
he
was
right
but
you
think
this
is
very
serious
serious
yes
exclaimed
felpham
he
says
he
spent
the
night
in
a
shed
in
the
harrow
road
district
now
the
things
that
were
taken
from
body
are
discovered
in
such
a
place
nay
the
very
place
for
if
you
remember
hyde
particularized
his
whereabouts
what
the
obvious
conclusion
what
can
anybody
think
i
see
two
or
three
obvious
conclusions
and
i
think
several
things
remarked
viner
i
tell
you
what
they
are
when
we
seen
drillford
i
not
alarmed
about
this
discovery
felpham
i
think
it
may
lead
to
finding
the
real
murderer
you
see
further
than
i
do
then
muttered
felpham
i
only
see
that
it
highly
dangerous
to
hyde
interests
and
i
want
information
about
it
drillford
discovered
alone
in
his
office
smiled
as
the
two
men
walked
in
there
was
an
irritating
air
about
him
ah
he
said
i
see
you
gentlemen
have
been
reading
the
afternoon
papers
what
do
you
think
about
your
friend
now
mr
viner
precisely
what
i
thought
before
and
shall
continue
to
think
retorted
viner
i
seen
no
reason
to
alter
my
opinion
oh
but
i
guess
felpham
does
think
that
way
replied
drillford
with
a
shrewd
glance
at
the
solicitor
felpham
knows
the
value
of
evidence
i
believe
what
is
it
that
been
found
exactly
asked
felpham
drillford
opened
a
locked
drawer
lifted
aside
a
sheet
of
cardboard
and
revealed
a
fine
gold
watch
and
chain
and
a
diamond
ring
these
lay
on
two
or
three
sheets
of
much
crumpled
paper
of
a
peculiar
quality
there
you
are
said
drillford
those
belonged
to
ashton
his
name
on
the
watch
and
a
mark
of
his
inside
the
ring
they
were
found
early
this
morning
hidden
in
the
very
place
in
which
hyde
confessed
that
he
spent
most
of
the
night
after
ashton
murder
a
shed
belonging
to
one
fisher
a
greengrocer
up
the
harrow
road
who
found
them
demanded
felpham
fisher
himself
answered
drillford
he
was
pottering
about
in
his
shed
before
going
to
covent
garden
he
wanted
some
empty
boxes
and
in
pulling
things
about
he
found
these
could
have
made
a
more
important
find
i
think
were
these
things
loose
asked
viner
wrapped
loosely
in
the
paper
they
lying
on
replied
drillford
viner
took
the
paper
out
of
the
drawer
examined
it
and
lifted
it
to
his
nose
i
wonder
if
hyde
really
did
put
those
things
there
he
said
how
hyde
came
to
be
carrying
about
with
him
these
sheets
of
paper
which
had
certainly
been
used
before
for
the
wrappings
of
chemicals
or
drugs
felpham
pricked
his
ears
eh
he
said
what
that
smell
for
yourself
answered
viner
let
the
inspector
smell
too
i
draw
the
attention
to
both
of
you
to
the
fact
because
we
raise
that
point
whenever
it
necessary
those
papers
have
at
some
time
been
used
to
wrap
some
drug
no
doubt
of
it
said
felpham
who
was
applying
the
papers
to
his
nose
smell
them
drillford
as
viner
says
what
would
hyde
be
doing
with
this
stuff
in
his
pocket
that
a
mere
detail
remarked
drillford
impatiently
these
chaps
that
mooch
about
as
hyde
was
doing
pick
up
all
sorts
of
odds
and
ends
he
may
have
pinched
them
from
a
chemist
shop
anyway
there
the
fact
and
we
hang
him
on
it
you
see
we
shall
never
see
anything
of
the
sort
said
viner
you
on
the
wrong
tack
inspector
let
me
put
two
or
three
things
to
your
intelligence
where
ashton
purse
i
know
for
a
fact
that
ashton
had
a
purse
full
of
money
when
he
went
out
of
his
house
that
night
killenhall
and
miss
wickham
saw
him
take
it
out
just
before
he
left
to
give
some
cash
to
the
parlourmaid
and
they
saw
him
replace
it
in
his
trousers
pocket
i
also
know
for
another
fact
where
he
spent
money
that
evening
in
short
i
know
now
a
good
deal
about
his
movements
for
some
hours
before
his
death
then
you
ought
to
tell
us
viner
said
drillford
a
little
sulkily
you
ought
to
keep
any
information
to
yourself
you
going
on
the
wrong
tack
or
i
might
retorted
viner
but
know
all
in
good
time
now
i
ask
you
again
where
ashton
purse
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
when
his
clothing
was
examined
almost
immediately
after
his
death
all
his
effects
were
gone
watch
chain
rings
pocketbook
purse
if
hyde
took
the
whole
lot
do
you
think
he
would
ever
have
been
such
a
consummate
ass
as
to
wait
until
next
morning
to
pawn
that
ring
in
edgware
road
the
idea
is
preposterous
and
why
pray
demanded
drillford
obviously
nettled
at
the
turn
which
the
conversation
was
taking
i
wonder
your
own
common
sense
does
tell
you
said
viner
with
intentional
directness
if
hyde
took
everything
from
his
victim
as
you
say
he
did
he
would
have
had
a
purse
full
of
ready
money
he
could
have
gone
off
to
some
respectable
he
could
have
put
a
hundred
miles
between
himself
and
london
by
he
would
have
had
ready
money
to
last
him
for
months
but
he
was
starving
when
he
went
to
the
pawnbrokers
hyde
told
you
the
truth
he
never
had
anything
but
that
ring
good
muttered
felpham
good
viner
that
one
in
the
eye
for
you
drillford
another
thing
that
you
forgetting
inspector
continued
viner
i
suppose
you
attach
some
value
to
probabilities
do
you
as
a
sensible
man
believe
for
one
moment
that
hyde
placed
in
the
position
he
is
would
be
such
a
fool
such
a
suicidal
fool
as
to
tell
you
about
that
particular
shed
if
he
really
hidden
those
things
there
the
mere
idea
is
absurd
ridiculous
good
again
viner
said
felpham
he
would
drillford
obviously
put
the
paper
and
the
valuables
which
had
been
wrapped
in
it
back
in
the
drawer
and
turned
the
key
all
very
well
talking
and
theorizing
viner
he
said
sullenly
we
know
from
his
own
lips
that
hyde
did
spend
the
night
in
that
shed
if
he
did
put
these
things
there
who
did
viner
gave
him
a
steady
look
the
man
who
murdered
and
robbed
ashton
he
answered
and
that
man
was
not
hyde
you
have
that
to
prove
retorted
drillford
derisively
i
know
what
a
jury
think
with
all
this
evidence
before
it
we
shall
prove
a
good
many
things
that
surprise
you
said
viner
quietly
and
you
see
then
the
foolishness
of
jumping
at
what
seems
to
be
an
obvious
conclusion
he
motioned
felpham
to
follow
and
going
outside
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
harrow
road
i
going
to
have
a
look
at
the
place
where
these
things
were
found
he
said
come
with
me
you
see
for
yourself
he
continued
as
they
walked
on
how
ridiculous
it
is
to
suppose
that
hyde
planted
them
the
whole
affair
is
plain
enough
to
me
the
real
murderer
read
or
may
have
heard
hyde
statement
before
the
coroner
and
in
order
to
strengthen
the
case
against
hyde
and
divert
suspicion
from
himself
sought
out
this
shed
and
put
the
things
there
clumsy
if
hyde
had
ever
had
the
purse
which
more
certainly
disappeared
with
the
rest
of
the
property
never
have
gone
to
that
shed
at
all
we
make
the
most
of
all
that
said
felpham
but
i
gathered
from
what
you
said
just
now
to
drillford
that
you
know
more
about
this
case
than
you
let
out
if
it
in
hyde
favour
i
ca
tell
you
what
i
know
answered
viner
i
do
know
some
strange
things
which
will
all
come
out
in
good
time
if
we
bring
the
murder
home
to
the
right
man
hyde
of
course
will
be
cleared
i
tell
everything
as
soon
as
i
can
felpham
they
walked
quickly
forward
until
they
came
to
the
higher
part
of
the
harrow
road
there
at
a
crowded
point
of
that
dismal
thoroughfare
where
the
shops
were
small
and
mean
felpham
suddenly
lifted
a
finger
towards
a
sign
which
hung
over
an
open
front
filled
with
the
cheaper
sorts
of
vegetables
here
the
place
he
said
a
corner
shop
the
shed
of
course
will
be
somewhere
behind
viner
looked
with
interest
at
the
refuge
which
hyde
had
chosen
after
his
hurried
flight
from
the
scene
of
the
murder
a
shabby
looking
street
ran
down
from
the
corner
of
the
greengrocer
shop
the
first
twenty
yards
of
it
on
that
side
were
filled
with
palings
more
or
less
broken
and
dilapidated
behind
them
lay
a
yard
in
which
stood
a
van
two
or
three
barrows
a
collection
of
boxes
and
baskets
and
crates
and
a
shed
built
against
the
wall
of
the
adjoining
house
the
door
of
this
yard
hung
loosely
on
its
rusty
hinges
viner
saw
at
once
that
nothing
could
be
easier
than
for
a
man
to
slip
into
this
miserable
shelter
unseen
let
get
hold
of
the
tenant
he
said
better
show
him
your
card
and
then
he
know
we
on
professional
business
the
greengrocer
a
fellow
who
was
measuring
potatoes
showed
no
great
interest
on
hearing
what
his
callers
wanted
summoning
his
wife
to
mind
the
shop
he
led
viner
and
felpham
round
to
the
yard
and
opened
the
door
of
the
shed
this
was
as
untidy
as
the
yard
and
filled
with
a
similar
collection
of
boxes
baskets
and
crates
in
one
corner
lay
a
bundle
of
empty
potato
sacks
the
greengrocer
at
once
pointed
to
it
i
reckon
that
where
the
fellow
got
a
bit
of
a
sleep
that
night
he
said
there
was
nothing
to
prevent
him
getting
in
here
no
locks
or
bolts
on
either
gate
of
the
yard
or
that
door
he
may
have
been
in
here
many
a
night
for
all
i
know
where
did
you
find
those
valuables
this
morning
asked
viner
the
greengrocer
pointed
to
a
shelf
in
a
corner
above
the
bundle
of
sacking
there
he
answered
i
wanted
some
small
boxes
to
take
down
to
covent
garden
and
in
turning
some
of
these
over
i
came
across
a
little
parcel
wrapped
in
paper
slipped
under
a
box
that
was
turned
top
downwards
on
the
shelf
you
understand
so
of
course
i
opened
it
and
there
was
the
watch
and
chain
and
ring
just
folded
in
the
papers
that
you
handed
to
the
police
suggested
viner
well
there
was
more
paper
about
than
what
i
gave
to
inspector
drillford
said
the
greengrocer
a
bit
of
parcel
it
was
there
the
rest
of
the
paper
there
where
i
threw
it
down
he
pointed
to
some
loose
sheets
of
paper
which
lay
on
the
sacking
and
viner
went
forward
picked
them
up
looked
quickly
at
them
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
i
suppose
you
never
heard
anybody
about
that
night
he
asked
turning
to
the
greengrocer
not
i
the
man
replied
i
sleep
too
sound
to
hear
aught
of
that
sort
there
nothing
in
here
that
of
any
value
no
a
dozen
folk
could
come
into
this
yard
at
night
and
we
should
hear
we
sleep
at
the
front
of
the
house
viner
slipped
some
silver
into
the
greengrocer
hand
and
led
felpham
away
and
when
they
reached
a
quieter
part
of
the
district
he
pulled
out
the
papers
which
he
had
picked
out
of
the
corner
in
the
shed
and
held
them
in
front
of
his
companion
eyes
we
did
some
good
in
coming
up
here
after
all
felpham
he
said
with
a
grim
smile
it
was
a
mere
desire
to
satisfy
idle
curiosity
that
made
me
come
i
thought
i
might
by
sheer
good
luck
hit
on
something
or
some
idea
that
would
help
now
then
look
at
these
things
that
a
piece
of
newspaper
from
out
of
a
copy
of
the
of
september
last
likely
thing
for
langton
hyde
to
be
carrying
in
his
pocket
eh
good
heavens
that
certainly
important
exclaimed
felpham
and
so
is
this
and
perhaps
much
more
so
said
viner
making
a
second
exhibit
that
a
sheet
of
brown
with
the
name
and
address
of
a
famous
firm
of
wholesale
druggists
and
chemical
manufacturers
on
one
side
printed
it
another
likely
thing
for
hyde
to
possess
and
to
carry
about
is
it
and
the
same
bitter
penetrating
smell
about
it
said
felpham
hyde
of
course
if
drillford
is
correct
had
all
this
paper
in
his
pocket
when
he
went
into
that
shed
said
viner
but
i
have
a
different
idea
and
a
different
theory
here
he
went
on
folding
his
discoveries
together
neatly
you
take
charge
of
these
and
take
care
of
them
they
may
be
of
more
importance
than
we
think
he
went
home
full
of
thought
restored
the
sisters
to
something
like
cheerfulness
by
assuring
them
that
the
situation
was
no
worse
and
possibly
rather
better
and
spent
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
his
study
silently
working
things
out
viner
by
the
time
he
went
to
bed
had
evolved
an
idea
and
it
was
still
developing
and
growing
stronger
when
he
set
out
next
morning
to
accompany
pawle
to
lord
solicitors
chapter
xvii
the
claimant
carless
and
driver
practised
their
profession
of
the
law
in
one
of
the
old
houses
on
the
south
side
of
lincoln
inn
fields
a
house
so
old
that
it
immediately
turned
viner
thought
to
what
he
had
read
of
the
days
wherein
inigo
jones
exercised
his
art
up
the
stately
frontages
and
duels
were
fought
in
the
gardens
which
london
children
now
sport
in
in
one
of
these
houses
lived
blackstone
in
another
erskine
one
ancient
roof
once
sheltered
john
milton
another
heard
the
laughter
of
nell
gwynn
up
the
panelled
staircase
which
pawle
and
his
companion
were
presently
conducted
the
feet
of
many
generations
had
trod
and
the
room
into
which
they
were
duly
conducted
was
so
in
appearance
with
its
oaken
walls
and
carving
and
furniture
that
nothing
but
the
fact
that
its
occupants
wore
twentieth
century
garments
would
have
convinced
viner
that
he
had
not
been
suddenly
thrown
back
to
the
days
of
queen
anne
lord
ellingham
was
already
there
when
they
arrived
in
conference
with
his
solicitor
carless
a
plump
rosy
active
gentleman
who
wore
whiskers
and
secretly
prided
himself
on
his
likeness
to
the
type
of
squire
it
was
very
evident
to
viner
that
both
solicitor
and
client
were
in
a
state
of
expectancy
bordering
on
something
very
like
excitement
and
carless
the
preliminary
greetings
being
over
plunged
at
once
into
the
subject
i
say
pawle
he
exclaimed
turning
at
once
to
his
this
appears
to
be
a
most
extraordinary
business
his
lordship
has
just
been
telling
me
all
about
the
two
calls
he
had
yesterday
first
from
two
men
whom
he
never
seen
before
then
from
you
two
who
were
also
strangers
he
has
also
told
me
what
both
lots
of
his
callers
had
to
say
and
hang
me
if
i
ever
heard
of
two
such
curious
unfoldings
coming
one
on
top
of
the
other
sounds
like
a
mystery
you
forget
remarked
pawle
with
a
glance
at
lord
ellingham
that
we
do
know
viner
and
myself
what
it
was
that
his
first
couple
of
callers
told
him
he
left
that
until
today
carless
looked
at
his
client
who
nodded
his
head
as
if
in
assent
to
something
in
the
glance
well
as
i
now
in
possession
of
the
facts
said
he
i
tell
you
pawle
his
lordship
has
given
me
a
clear
account
of
what
his
first
callers
said
and
what
you
and
viner
added
to
it
the
two
men
whom
you
saw
coming
away
from
ellingham
house
were
methley
and
woodlesford
two
solicitors
who
are
in
partnership
in
edgware
road
i
know
of
them
i
think
we
had
conveyancing
business
with
them
once
or
twice
quite
a
respectable
firm
in
a
smallish
way
you
know
but
all
right
so
far
as
i
know
anything
of
them
now
they
came
to
lord
ellingham
yesterday
afternoon
with
a
most
extraordinary
story
his
lordship
tells
me
that
he
learned
from
your
talk
with
him
yesterday
afternoon
that
you
are
pretty
well
acquainted
you
and
viner
with
his
family
history
so
i
go
straight
to
the
point
what
do
you
think
methley
and
woodlesford
came
to
tell
him
you
never
guess
i
wo
try
answered
pawle
what
then
carless
smiled
grimly
that
the
lord
marketstoke
was
alive
and
in
england
he
said
here
in
fact
in
london
pawle
smiled
too
but
his
smile
was
not
grim
it
was
rather
the
smile
of
a
man
who
hears
what
he
has
been
expecting
to
hear
i
thought
it
would
be
something
of
that
sort
he
exclaimed
aye
i
fancied
that
would
be
the
game
you
think
it
a
game
suggested
carless
and
a
highly
dangerous
one
as
somebody
will
find
out
responded
pawle
but
what
did
these
fellows
really
say
his
lordship
will
correct
me
if
i
miss
anything
pertinent
answered
carless
with
a
glance
at
his
client
they
said
this
that
they
had
been
called
upon
by
a
gentleman
now
staying
at
one
of
the
private
residential
hotels
in
lancaster
gate
who
was
desirous
of
legal
assistance
in
an
important
matter
and
had
been
recommended
to
them
by
a
at
the
hotel
he
then
told
them
that
though
he
was
now
passing
under
the
name
of
cave
ah
exclaimed
pawle
with
a
snort
which
denoted
a
certain
sort
of
surprised
satisfaction
ah
to
be
sure
cave
of
course
but
i
interrupt
you
pray
proceed
i
see
your
point
remarked
carless
with
a
smile
well
although
he
was
passing
under
the
name
of
cave
he
was
in
strict
reality
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
from
england
many
years
ago
who
was
never
heard
of
again
and
whose
death
had
been
presumed
he
was
therefore
the
rightful
earl
of
ellingham
and
as
such
entitled
to
the
estates
he
proceeded
to
tell
methley
and
woodlesford
his
adventures
he
had
he
said
never
at
any
time
from
boyhood
been
on
good
terms
with
his
father
there
had
always
been
mutual
dislike
as
he
grew
to
manhood
his
father
had
thwarted
him
in
every
conceivable
way
he
himself
as
a
young
man
had
developed
radical
and
democratic
ideas
this
had
caused
a
further
widening
of
the
breach
eventually
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
clear
out
of
england
altogether
he
had
a
modest
amount
of
money
of
his
own
a
few
thousands
which
had
been
left
him
by
his
mother
so
he
took
this
and
quietly
disappeared
according
to
his
own
account
he
became
a
good
deal
of
a
rolling
stone
going
to
various
parts
of
the
earth
and
taking
particular
pains
wherever
he
went
to
conceal
his
identity
he
told
these
people
methley
and
woodlesford
that
he
had
at
one
time
or
another
lived
and
traded
in
south
africa
india
china
japan
and
the
malay
settlement
finally
he
had
settled
down
in
australia
he
had
kept
himself
familiar
with
events
at
home
knew
of
his
father
death
and
he
saw
no
end
of
advertisements
for
himself
he
was
aware
that
legal
proceedings
were
taken
as
regards
the
presumption
of
his
death
and
the
administration
of
the
estates
he
was
also
aware
of
the
death
of
his
younger
brother
and
that
title
and
estates
were
now
in
possession
of
his
nephew
his
lordship
there
in
fact
he
was
very
well
up
in
the
whole
story
according
to
methley
and
woodlesford
said
carless
with
a
smile
and
lord
ellingham
believed
that
methley
and
woodlesford
were
genuinely
convinced
by
him
seemed
so
anyway
both
of
agreed
lord
ellingham
however
continued
carless
methley
and
woodlesford
like
you
and
i
pawle
are
limbs
of
the
law
they
asked
two
very
pertinent
questions
first
why
had
he
come
forward
after
this
long
interval
second
what
evidence
had
he
to
support
and
prove
his
claim
good
muttered
pawle
and
i
be
bound
he
had
some
excellent
replies
ready
for
them
he
had
said
carless
he
answered
as
regards
the
first
question
that
of
late
things
had
not
gone
well
with
him
he
was
still
comfortably
off
but
he
had
lost
a
lot
of
money
in
australia
through
speculation
he
replied
to
the
second
by
producing
certain
papers
and
documents
ah
exclaimed
pawle
nudging
viner
now
we
warming
to
it
and
according
to
what
methley
and
woodlesford
told
lord
ellingham
continued
carless
these
papers
and
documents
are
of
a
very
convincing
nature
they
said
to
his
lordship
frankly
that
they
were
greatly
surprised
by
them
they
had
thought
that
this
man
might
possibly
be
a
bogus
claimant
who
had
somehow
gained
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
facts
he
was
narrating
but
the
papers
he
produced
which
he
alleged
had
never
been
out
of
his
possession
since
his
secret
flight
from
london
were
well
staggering
after
inspecting
them
methley
and
woodlesford
came
to
the
conclusion
that
their
caller
really
was
what
he
claimed
to
be
the
missing
man
what
were
the
papers
demanded
pawle
oh
replied
carless
looking
at
his
client
letters
certificates
and
the
like
all
according
to
methley
and
woodlesford
excellent
proofs
of
identity
did
they
show
them
to
your
lordship
asked
pawle
oh
no
they
only
told
me
of
them
answered
lord
ellingham
they
said
of
course
that
they
would
be
shown
to
me
or
to
mr
carless
aye
muttered
pawle
just
so
yes
and
they
will
have
to
be
shown
that
follows
as
a
matter
of
course
observed
carless
but
now
pawle
we
come
to
the
real
point
of
the
case
methley
and
woodlesford
having
informed
his
lordship
of
all
this
when
they
called
on
him
yesterday
afternoon
then
proceeded
to
tell
him
precisely
what
their
client
the
claimant
as
we
will
now
call
him
really
wanted
for
he
had
been
at
some
pains
considerable
pains
to
make
himself
clear
on
that
point
to
them
and
he
desired
them
to
make
themselves
clear
to
lord
ellingham
whom
he
throughout
referred
to
as
his
nephew
he
had
no
desire
he
told
them
to
recover
his
title
nor
the
estates
he
did
not
care
a
cent
his
own
phrase
for
the
title
he
was
now
sixty
years
of
age
the
life
he
had
lived
had
quite
unfitted
him
for
the
positions
and
duties
of
an
english
nobleman
he
wanted
to
go
back
to
the
country
in
which
he
had
settled
but
as
title
and
estates
really
were
his
he
wanted
his
nephew
the
present
holder
to
make
him
a
proper
payment
in
consideration
of
the
receipt
of
which
he
would
engage
to
preserve
the
silence
which
he
had
already
kept
so
thoroughly
and
effectively
for
years
eh
in
plain
language
said
pawle
he
wanted
to
be
bought
precisely
agreed
carless
of
course
methley
and
woodlesford
did
quite
put
it
in
that
light
they
put
it
that
their
client
had
no
wish
to
disturb
his
nephew
but
suggested
kindly
that
his
nephew
should
make
him
a
proper
payment
out
of
his
abundance
pawle
turned
to
lord
ellingham
did
they
mention
a
sum
to
your
lordship
he
asked
yes
replied
lord
ellingham
with
a
smile
at
carless
they
did
tentatively
how
much
asked
pawle
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
on
receipt
of
which
i
suppose
observed
pawle
dryly
nothing
would
ever
be
heard
again
of
your
lordship
uncle
the
rightful
owner
of
all
that
your
lordship
possesses
lord
ellingham
laughed
so
i
gathered
he
answered
i
wish
i
been
present
when
methley
and
woodlesford
put
forward
that
proposition
exclaimed
the
old
lawyer
did
they
seem
serious
oh
i
think
they
were
quite
serious
replied
lord
ellingham
they
seemed
so
they
spoke
of
it
as
what
they
called
a
domestic
arrangement
excellent
phrase
remarked
pawle
and
what
said
your
lordship
to
their
or
the
claimant
proposition
i
told
them
that
the
matter
was
so
serious
that
they
and
i
must
see
my
solicitors
about
it
answered
lord
ellingham
and
i
arranged
to
meet
them
here
at
one
today
they
quite
agreed
that
that
was
the
proper
thing
to
do
and
went
away
then
you
and
viner
called
with
i
understand
another
extraordinary
story
remarked
carless
the
particulars
of
which
his
lordship
has
also
told
me
now
pawle
what
do
you
really
say
about
all
this
pawle
smote
his
clenched
right
fist
on
the
palm
of
his
open
left
hand
i
will
tell
you
what
i
say
carless
he
exclaimed
with
emphasis
i
say
that
whatever
the
papers
and
documents
were
which
were
produced
by
this
man
to
methley
and
woodlesford
they
were
stolen
from
the
body
of
john
ashton
who
was
foully
murdered
in
lonsdale
passage
only
last
week
i
stake
all
i
have
on
that
now
then
did
this
claimant
steal
them
did
he
murder
john
ashton
for
them
no
a
thousand
times
no
for
no
man
would
have
been
such
a
fool
as
to
come
forward
with
them
so
soon
after
his
victim
death
this
claimant
does
know
how
or
where
or
when
they
were
obtained
he
does
suspect
that
murder
in
it
now
then
where
did
he
get
them
who
at
the
back
of
him
who
to
be
plain
making
a
of
him
find
that
out
and
we
shall
know
who
murdered
john
ashton
viner
glancing
at
lord
ellingham
and
at
carless
saw
that
pawle
words
had
impressed
them
greatly
the
solicitor
especially
he
nodded
sympathetically
and
pawle
went
on
speaking
listen
here
carless
he
continued
viner
and
i
have
been
investigating
this
case
as
far
as
we
could
largely
to
save
a
man
whom
we
both
believe
to
be
absolutely
innocent
of
murder
i
have
come
to
certain
conclusions
john
ashton
many
years
ago
fell
in
with
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
then
living
under
the
name
of
wickham
in
australia
and
they
became
close
friends
at
some
time
or
other
wickham
told
ashton
the
real
truth
about
himself
and
when
he
died
left
his
little
daughter
carless
looked
sharply
round
ah
he
exclaimed
so
there
a
daughter
there
is
a
daughter
and
her
name
is
avice
a
name
borne
by
a
good
many
women
of
the
family
answered
pawle
with
a
significant
glance
at
his
but
let
me
go
on
wickham
left
his
daughter
her
mother
being
dead
in
ashton
guardianship
she
was
then
about
six
years
of
age
ashton
sent
her
to
school
here
in
england
about
twelve
or
thirteen
years
later
he
came
home
and
settled
in
markendale
square
he
brought
avice
wickham
to
live
with
him
he
handed
over
to
her
a
considerable
sum
which
he
said
her
father
had
left
in
his
hands
for
her
and
then
secretly
ashton
went
down
to
marketstoke
and
evidently
made
certain
inquiries
and
investigations
whether
he
was
going
to
reveal
the
truth
as
to
what
i
have
just
told
you
we
do
know
probably
he
was
but
he
was
murdered
and
we
all
know
when
and
where
and
i
say
he
was
murdered
for
the
sake
of
these
very
papers
which
we
now
know
were
produced
to
methley
and
woodlesford
by
this
claimant
now
then
carless
suddenly
bent
forward
a
moment
pawle
he
said
if
this
man
wickham
really
was
the
lost
lord
marketstoke
and
he
dead
and
he
left
a
daughter
and
the
daughter
alive
well
demanded
pawle
well
why
then
of
course
that
daughter
said
carless
slowly
that
daughter
is
a
clerk
opened
the
door
and
glanced
at
his
employer
methley
and
woodlesford
sir
he
announced
by
appointment
chapter
xviii
let
him
appear
the
meeting
between
the
solicitors
suggested
to
viner
and
to
lord
ellingham
who
looked
on
curiously
while
they
exchanged
formal
greetings
and
explanations
a
certain
solemnity
each
of
them
seemed
to
imply
in
look
and
manner
that
this
was
an
unusually
grave
occasion
and
carless
assuming
the
direction
of
things
became
almost
judicial
in
his
deportment
well
gentlemen
he
said
when
they
had
all
gathered
about
his
desk
lord
ellingham
has
informed
me
of
what
passed
between
you
and
himself
at
his
house
yesterday
in
plain
language
the
client
whom
you
represent
claims
to
be
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
so
completely
many
years
ago
and
therefore
the
rightful
earl
of
ellingham
now
a
first
question
do
you
as
his
legal
advisers
believe
in
his
claim
judging
by
the
proofs
with
which
he
has
furnished
us
yes
answered
methley
there
seems
to
be
no
doubt
of
it
we
ask
for
these
proofs
presently
remarked
carless
but
now
a
further
question
your
client
whom
we
now
call
the
claimant
had
i
understand
no
desire
to
take
up
his
rightful
position
and
suggests
that
the
secret
shall
remain
a
secret
and
that
he
shall
be
paid
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
to
hold
his
tongue
if
you
put
it
that
way
yes
replied
methley
i
do
know
in
what
other
way
it
could
be
put
said
carless
grimly
it
the
plain
truth
but
now
if
lord
ellingham
refuses
that
offer
does
your
client
intend
to
commence
proceedings
our
instructions
are
yes
answered
methley
very
good
said
carless
now
then
what
are
these
proofs
methley
turned
to
his
partner
who
immediately
thrust
a
hand
in
his
breastpocket
and
produced
a
long
envelope
i
have
them
here
said
woodlesford
our
client
intrusted
them
to
us
so
that
we
might
show
them
to
lord
ellingham
if
necessary
there
are
not
many
documents
they
all
relate
to
the
period
of
our
client
life
before
he
left
england
there
are
one
or
two
important
letters
from
his
father
the
seventh
earl
two
or
three
from
his
mother
there
is
also
his
mother
will
there
is
one
letter
from
his
younger
brother
to
whom
he
had
evidently
more
than
once
announced
his
determination
of
leaving
home
for
a
considerable
time
there
are
two
letters
from
your
own
firm
relating
to
some
property
which
lord
marketstoke
disposed
of
before
he
left
london
there
is
a
schedule
or
memorandum
of
certain
personal
effects
which
he
left
in
his
rooms
at
ellingham
hall
there
is
also
a
receipt
from
his
bankers
for
a
quantity
of
plate
and
jewellery
which
he
had
deposited
with
them
before
leaving
these
things
had
been
left
him
by
his
mother
there
are
also
two
documents
which
he
seems
to
have
considered
it
worth
while
to
preserve
all
these
years
concluded
woodlesford
with
a
smile
one
is
a
letter
informing
him
that
he
had
been
elected
a
member
of
the
the
other
is
his
commission
as
a
justice
of
the
peace
for
the
county
of
buckinghamshire
as
he
detailed
these
things
woodlesford
laid
each
specified
paper
before
carless
and
then
they
all
gathered
round
and
examined
each
exhibit
the
various
documents
were
somewhat
faded
with
age
and
the
edges
of
some
were
worn
as
if
from
long
folding
and
keeping
in
a
pocketbook
carless
hastily
ran
his
eye
over
them
very
interesting
gentlemen
he
remarked
but
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
these
things
do
prove
your
client
to
be
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
a
judge
and
jury
would
want
a
lot
more
evidence
than
that
the
mere
fact
that
your
man
is
in
possession
of
all
these
documents
proves
nothing
whatever
he
may
have
stolen
them
from
what
we
have
seen
of
our
client
carless
observed
methley
with
some
stiffness
of
manner
there
is
no
need
for
such
a
suggestion
i
dare
say
we
shall
all
see
a
good
deal
of
your
client
before
this
matter
is
settled
methley
retorted
carless
and
even
when
i
have
seen
a
lot
of
him
i
should
still
say
the
same
he
have
stolen
them
what
else
has
he
to
prove
that
he
what
he
says
he
is
he
is
fully
conversant
with
his
family
history
said
woodlesford
he
can
give
a
perfectly
full
and
so
far
as
we
can
judge
accurate
account
of
his
early
life
and
of
his
subsequent
doings
he
evidently
knows
all
about
ellingham
hall
marketstoke
and
the
surroundings
i
think
if
you
were
to
examine
him
on
these
points
you
would
find
that
his
memory
is
surprisingly
fresh
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
come
to
his
being
examined
on
a
great
many
points
and
in
much
detail
said
carless
with
a
dry
smile
of
course
i
shall
be
much
interested
in
seeing
him
you
see
i
remember
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
very
well
indeed
he
was
often
in
here
when
i
as
a
lad
of
nineteen
or
twenty
was
articled
to
my
own
father
and
now
gentlemen
i
ask
you
a
question
and
commend
it
to
your
intelligence
and
common
sense
if
your
client
is
this
man
he
claims
to
be
why
he
come
straight
to
carless
and
driver
whom
he
would
remember
well
enough
instead
of
going
to
methley
and
woodlesford
come
now
neither
visitor
answered
this
question
and
pawle
suddenly
turned
on
them
with
another
did
your
client
mention
to
you
that
he
knew
carless
and
driver
as
the
family
solicitors
he
asked
no
i
ca
say
that
he
did
admitted
methley
after
all
years
absence
you
know
you
said
just
now
that
his
memory
was
surprisingly
fresh
interrupted
pawle
surely
replied
woodlesford
surely
you
ca
expect
a
man
who
has
been
away
from
england
all
that
time
to
remember
everything
i
should
have
expected
lord
marketstoke
to
have
gone
straight
to
the
family
solicitors
anyway
retorted
pawle
obvious
thing
to
do
if
his
story
is
a
true
one
woodlesford
glanced
at
his
partner
and
repossessing
himself
of
the
documents
began
to
arrange
them
in
the
envelope
from
which
he
had
drawn
them
we
can
not
of
course
say
positively
who
our
client
is
or
who
he
is
not
he
said
all
we
can
say
is
that
he
came
to
us
with
an
introduction
from
an
old
client
of
ours
whom
we
knew
very
well
and
that
his
story
seems
to
us
to
be
quite
credible
no
doubt
he
can
bring
further
proof
that
he
did
not
come
here
in
the
first
instance
i
tell
you
why
i
personally
am
very
much
surprised
that
he
did
interrupted
carless
you
told
lord
ellingham
yesterday
that
your
client
saw
no
end
of
advertisements
for
him
at
the
time
of
his
death
now
we
carless
and
driver
sent
out
those
advertisements
our
name
was
appended
to
every
one
of
them
wherever
they
appeared
why
then
when
this
man
if
he
is
the
real
man
returned
home
did
he
not
come
to
us
for
there
are
three
persons
in
this
office
who
but
wait
he
touched
a
bell
the
clerk
who
had
announced
methley
and
woodlesford
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
ask
portlethwaite
to
come
here
commanded
carless
and
just
find
out
if
driver
is
in
his
room
portlethwaite
can
tell
me
when
he
comes
an
elderly
man
presently
appeared
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
as
if
aware
of
the
sacred
nature
of
the
proceedings
driver
is
out
carless
he
said
you
wanted
me
i
think
our
senior
clerk
observed
carless
by
way
of
introduction
portlethwaite
you
remember
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
some
years
ago
portlethwaite
smiled
quite
well
mr
carless
he
answered
as
if
it
were
yesterday
he
used
to
come
here
a
good
deal
you
know
do
you
think
you
know
him
again
portlethwaite
after
all
these
years
asked
carless
years
mind
the
elderly
clerk
smiled
more
assuredly
than
before
then
he
looked
significantly
at
a
corner
of
the
room
and
carless
took
the
hint
and
rising
from
his
chair
went
aside
with
him
portlethwaite
whispered
something
in
his
employer
ear
and
carless
suddenly
laughed
and
nodded
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
i
remember
now
he
said
aloud
thank
you
portlethwaite
that
all
well
gentlemen
he
continued
returning
to
his
desk
when
the
clerk
had
gone
i
think
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
bring
your
client
here
if
he
is
the
real
and
genuine
article
he
will
i
am
sure
be
very
glad
indeed
to
meet
three
persons
who
knew
him
quite
intimately
in
the
old
days
driver
portlethwaite
and
myself
and
i
really
do
know
that
there
any
more
to
do
or
say
the
two
visitors
rose
and
methley
looked
at
carless
in
a
questioning
fashion
am
i
to
go
away
with
the
impression
that
you
believe
our
client
to
be
an
impostor
he
said
quietly
frankly
i
do
answered
carless
so
do
i
exclaimed
pawle
emphatically
so
in
that
case
said
methley
i
see
no
advantage
in
bringing
him
here
not
even
anything
to
your
own
advantage
suggested
carless
with
a
keen
glance
which
passed
from
one
partner
to
the
other
you
as
reputable
practitioners
of
our
profession
do
want
to
be
mixed
up
with
an
impostor
we
should
be
very
sorry
to
be
mixed
up
in
any
way
with
an
impostor
mr
carless
said
methley
carless
pursed
his
lips
for
a
moment
as
if
he
were
never
going
to
open
them
again
then
he
suddenly
relaxed
them
i
tell
you
what
it
is
gentlemen
he
said
i
only
anticipating
matters
in
saying
what
i
going
to
say
and
i
saying
it
because
i
feel
sure
you
are
quite
sincere
and
genuine
in
this
affair
and
are
being
deceived
if
you
will
bring
your
client
here
there
are
three
of
us
in
this
office
who
as
my
old
clerk
has
just
reminded
me
can
positively
identify
him
on
the
instant
if
he
is
the
man
he
claims
to
be
positively
i
say
and
at
once
there
may
one
ask
how
said
woodlesford
no
exclaimed
carless
bring
him
telephone
an
appointment
and
we
settle
the
matter
as
soon
as
he
sets
foot
inside
that
door
may
we
tell
him
that
asked
methley
you
can
do
as
you
like
answered
carless
between
ourselves
i
should
but
i
assure
you
we
can
tell
in
one
glance
that
a
fact
the
two
solicitors
went
away
and
viner
who
had
closely
watched
methley
during
the
interview
followed
them
out
and
hailed
methley
in
the
corridor
outside
carless
room
may
i
have
a
word
with
you
he
asked
drawing
him
aside
i
do
know
if
you
remember
but
i
saw
you
the
other
night
in
the
parlour
of
that
old
tavern
in
notting
hill
you
came
in
while
i
was
there
i
had
some
idea
that
i
remembered
your
face
when
we
were
introduced
just
now
said
methley
yes
i
think
i
do
remember
you
were
sitting
in
a
corner
near
the
hearth
just
so
agreed
viner
and
i
heard
you
ask
the
landlord
a
question
about
a
gentleman
whom
you
used
to
meet
there
sometimes
you
left
some
specimen
cigars
with
the
landlord
for
him
yes
assented
methley
wonderingly
you
never
knew
that
man
name
continued
viner
nor
who
he
was
just
so
so
i
gathered
then
i
tell
you
there
was
a
good
reason
why
he
had
not
been
to
that
tavern
for
some
nights
he
was
john
ashton
the
man
who
was
murdered
in
lonsdale
passage
viner
was
watching
his
man
with
all
the
keenness
of
which
he
was
capable
and
he
saw
that
this
announcement
fell
on
methley
as
an
absolute
surprise
he
started
as
only
a
man
can
start
who
has
astounding
news
given
to
him
suddenly
god
bless
me
he
exclaimed
you
do
mean
it
of
course
i
know
about
that
murder
our
own
district
and
i
saw
ashton
picture
in
the
paper
but
then
there
are
so
many
elderly
men
of
that
type
broad
features
trimmed
grey
beard
dear
me
dear
me
a
very
pleasant
genial
fellow
i
astonished
mr
viner
viner
resolved
on
a
bold
step
he
would
take
it
without
consulting
pawle
or
anybody
he
drew
methley
further
aside
methley
he
said
you
a
man
of
honour
and
i
trust
you
with
a
secret
to
be
kept
until
i
release
you
from
the
obligation
of
secrecy
i
have
reasons
for
getting
at
the
truth
about
ashton
murder
so
has
pawle
he
and
i
have
been
making
investigations
and
inquiries
and
we
are
convinced
we
are
positive
that
these
papers
which
your
partner
now
has
in
his
pocket
were
stolen
from
ashton
dead
body
that
in
fact
ashton
was
murdered
for
the
possession
of
them
and
i
tell
you
for
your
own
sake
find
out
who
this
client
of
yours
is
that
he
was
the
actual
murderer
i
do
believe
for
a
second
he
is
probably
a
mere
but
who
behind
him
if
you
can
do
anything
to
find
out
the
truth
do
it
that
methley
was
astonished
beyond
belief
was
so
evident
that
viner
was
now
absolutely
convinced
of
his
sincerity
he
stood
staring
for
a
moment
then
he
glanced
at
woodlesford
who
was
waiting
at
some
distance
along
the
corridor
mr
viner
he
said
you
amaze
me
listen
my
partner
is
as
sound
and
honest
a
fellow
as
there
is
in
all
london
let
me
tell
him
this
engage
for
his
secrecy
if
you
consent
to
that
i
see
that
without
a
word
from
us
as
to
why
this
man
who
claims
to
be
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
is
brought
here
if
what
you
say
is
true
we
are
not
going
to
be
partners
to
a
crime
let
me
tell
woodlesford
i
answer
for
him
viner
considered
this
proposition
for
a
moment
very
well
he
said
at
last
tell
him
i
shall
trust
you
both
remember
it
between
the
three
of
us
i
sha
say
a
word
to
pawle
nor
to
carless
you
know
there
a
man
life
at
stake
hyde
hyde
is
as
innocent
as
i
am
he
an
old
schoolfellow
of
mine
i
understand
said
methley
very
well
trust
to
me
mr
viner
he
went
off
with
a
reassuring
nod
and
viner
returned
to
room
the
three
men
he
had
left
there
were
deep
in
conversation
and
as
he
entered
carless
smote
his
hand
on
the
desk
before
him
this
is
certain
he
exclaimed
we
must
have
this
miss
avice
wickham
here
at
once
chapter
xix
under
examination
pawle
nodded
assent
to
this
proposition
and
rose
from
his
chair
it
the
only
thing
to
do
he
said
we
must
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
as
quickly
as
possible
whether
miss
wickham
can
tell
us
much
or
little
we
must
know
what
she
can
tell
let
us
all
meet
here
again
at
three
i
will
send
one
of
my
clerks
to
fetch
her
but
let
us
be
clear
on
one
point
are
we
to
tell
this
young
lady
what
our
conclusions
are
regarding
herself
your
conclusions
said
carless
with
a
sly
smile
we
know
nothing
yet
you
know
pawle
my
conclusions
then
assented
pawle
are
we
lord
ellingham
quietly
interrupted
the
old
lawyer
pardon
me
pawle
he
said
but
before
we
go
any
further
do
you
mind
telling
me
briefly
what
your
conclusions
really
are
i
will
tell
your
lordship
in
a
few
words
answered
pawle
readily
wrong
or
right
my
conclusions
are
these
from
certain
investigations
which
viner
and
i
have
made
since
this
affair
began
with
the
murder
of
ashton
and
from
certain
evidence
which
we
have
unearthed
i
believe
that
ashton
friend
wickham
the
father
of
the
girl
we
are
going
to
produce
this
afternoon
was
in
reality
your
lordship
uncle
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
i
believe
that
ashton
came
to
england
in
order
to
prove
this
and
that
he
was
probably
about
to
begin
proceedings
when
he
was
murdered
for
the
sake
of
those
papers
which
we
have
just
seen
and
i
believe
too
that
we
have
not
seen
all
the
papers
which
were
stolen
from
his
dead
body
what
was
produced
to
us
just
now
by
methley
and
woodlesford
was
a
selection
the
probability
is
that
there
are
other
and
more
important
papers
in
the
hands
of
the
murderer
whose
or
accomplice
this
claimant
whoever
he
may
be
is
i
believe
concluded
pawle
with
emphasis
that
my
conclusions
will
be
found
to
be
correct
ones
based
on
indisputable
fact
lord
ellingham
looked
from
one
solicitor
to
the
other
then
he
said
with
something
of
a
smile
if
wickham
was
really
my
uncle
lord
marketstoke
and
this
young
lady
you
tell
me
of
is
his
daughter
what
definitely
is
my
position
pawle
looked
at
carless
and
carless
shook
his
head
if
pawle
theory
is
correct
he
said
and
mind
you
pawle
it
will
take
a
lot
of
proving
if
pawle
theory
is
correct
the
position
my
lord
is
this
the
young
lady
we
hear
of
is
countess
of
ellingham
in
her
own
right
she
would
not
be
the
first
woman
to
succeed
to
the
title
there
was
a
countess
of
ellingham
in
the
time
of
george
the
third
she
would
of
course
have
to
prove
her
claim
before
the
house
of
lords
if
made
good
she
succeeds
to
titles
and
estates
that
the
plain
english
of
it
and
upon
my
honour
concluded
carless
it
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
things
i
ever
heard
of
this
other
affair
is
nothing
to
it
lord
ellingham
again
inspected
the
legal
countenances
i
see
nothing
at
all
improbable
about
it
he
said
we
may
as
well
face
that
fact
at
once
i
will
be
here
at
three
carless
i
confess
i
should
like
to
meet
my
cousin
if
she
really
is
that
your
lordship
takes
it
admirably
exclaimed
carless
but
really
well
i
do
know
however
we
shall
see
but
my
honour
it
most
odd
one
claimant
disposed
of
another
a
more
formidable
one
comes
on
but
we
have
not
disposed
of
the
first
have
we
suggested
lord
ellingham
i
do
anticipate
any
trouble
in
that
quarter
answered
carless
as
i
said
to
those
two
who
have
just
gone
out
send
or
bring
the
man
here
and
we
tell
in
one
minute
if
he
what
he
claims
to
be
but
how
asked
lord
ellingham
you
seem
very
certain
dead
certain
asserted
carless
he
looked
round
his
callers
and
laughed
i
may
as
well
tell
you
he
said
portlethwaite
drew
me
aside
to
remind
me
of
it
the
real
lord
marketstoke
if
he
were
alive
could
easily
be
identified
he
lost
a
finger
when
a
mere
boy
ah
exclaimed
pawle
good
excellent
best
bit
of
evidence
heard
of
hang
this
claimant
now
we
can
tell
if
wickham
really
was
lord
marketstoke
if
necessary
we
can
have
his
body
exhumed
and
examined
it
was
a
shooting
accident
continued
carless
he
was
out
shooting
in
the
park
at
ellingham
when
a
boy
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
he
was
using
an
old
gun
it
burst
and
he
lost
his
second
finger
the
right
hand
it
was
of
course
very
noticeable
now
that
small
but
very
important
fact
is
most
likely
not
known
to
methley
and
client
but
it
known
to
driver
and
to
portlethwaite
and
to
me
and
now
to
all
of
you
if
this
man
comes
here
look
at
his
right
hand
if
he
possesses
his
full
complement
of
fingers
well
carless
ended
with
a
significant
grimace
and
pawle
nodding
assent
returned
to
the
question
which
he
was
putting
when
lord
ellingham
interrupted
him
now
let
us
settle
the
point
i
raised
he
said
are
we
to
tell
miss
wickham
what
my
conclusions
are
or
are
we
to
leave
her
in
ignorance
until
we
get
proof
that
they
are
correct
or
incorrect
answered
carless
with
an
admonitory
laugh
i
should
say
at
present
tell
her
nothing
let
us
find
out
all
we
can
from
her
there
are
several
questions
i
should
like
to
ask
her
myself
arising
out
of
what
you
have
told
us
leave
all
the
rest
until
a
later
period
if
your
theory
is
correct
pawle
it
can
be
established
if
it
is
the
girl
may
as
well
be
left
in
ignorance
that
you
ever
raised
it
until
three
then
said
pawle
three
found
the
old
lawyer
and
viner
pacing
the
pavement
of
lincoln
inn
fields
in
expectation
of
miss
wickham
arrival
she
came
at
last
in
the
taxicab
which
pawle
had
sent
for
her
and
her
first
words
on
stepping
out
of
it
were
of
surprise
and
inquiry
what
is
it
mr
pawle
she
demanded
as
she
shook
hands
with
her
two
squires
more
questions
what
it
all
about
pawle
nudged
viner
arm
my
dear
young
lady
he
answered
in
grave
and
fatherly
fashion
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
a
man
life
is
in
danger
we
are
doing
all
we
can
to
clear
that
unfortunate
young
fellow
hyde
of
the
dreadful
charge
which
has
been
brought
against
him
and
to
do
that
we
must
get
to
know
all
we
can
about
your
late
guardian
you
know
i
know
so
little
about
ashton
said
miss
wickham
looking
apprehensively
at
the
building
towards
which
she
was
being
conducted
where
are
you
taking
me
to
a
solicitor
office
friends
of
mine
answered
pawle
carless
and
driver
excellent
people
carless
wants
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
in
the
hope
that
your
answers
will
give
us
a
little
more
light
on
ashton
history
you
need
be
afraid
of
carless
he
added
as
they
began
to
climb
the
stairs
carless
is
quite
a
pleasant
fellow
and
he
has
with
him
a
very
amiable
young
gentleman
lord
ellingham
of
whom
you
need
be
afraid
either
and
why
is
lord
ellingham
whoever
he
may
be
there
inquired
miss
wickham
lord
ellingham
is
also
interested
in
your
late
guardian
replied
pawle
in
fact
we
are
all
interested
so
now
rub
up
your
memory
and
answer
carless
questions
viner
remained
in
the
background
quietly
watching
while
pawle
effected
the
necessary
introductions
he
was
at
once
struck
by
what
seemed
to
him
an
indisputable
fact
between
lord
ellingham
and
miss
wickham
there
was
an
unmistakable
family
likeness
and
he
judged
from
the
curious
scrutinizing
look
which
carless
gave
the
two
young
people
as
they
shook
hands
that
the
same
idea
struck
him
carless
wound
up
that
look
in
a
significant
glance
at
pawle
to
whom
he
suddenly
muttered
a
few
words
which
viner
caught
by
jove
he
whispered
i
should
wonder
if
you
right
then
he
placed
miss
wickham
in
an
on
his
right
hand
and
cast
a
preliminary
benevolent
glance
on
her
pawle
he
began
has
told
us
of
your
relationship
with
the
late
ashton
you
always
regarded
him
as
your
guardian
he
was
my
guardian
answered
miss
wickham
my
father
left
me
in
his
charge
just
so
now
have
you
any
recollection
of
your
father
only
very
vague
recollections
i
was
scarcely
six
i
think
when
he
died
what
do
you
remember
about
him
i
think
he
was
a
tall
handsome
man
i
have
some
impression
that
he
was
i
think
too
that
he
had
a
fair
complexion
and
hair
but
it
all
very
vague
do
you
remember
where
you
lived
only
that
it
was
in
a
very
big
town
melbourne
of
course
i
have
recollections
of
busy
streets
i
remember
too
that
when
i
left
there
it
was
very
very
hot
weather
do
you
remember
ashton
at
that
time
oh
yes
i
remember
ashton
i
had
nobody
else
you
see
my
mother
had
died
when
i
was
quite
little
i
have
no
recollection
whatever
of
her
i
remember
ashton
house
and
that
he
used
to
buy
me
lots
of
toys
his
house
was
in
a
quiet
part
of
the
town
and
he
had
a
big
shady
garden
how
long
so
far
as
you
remember
did
you
live
with
ashton
there
not
very
long
i
think
he
told
me
that
i
was
to
go
to
england
to
school
for
a
little
time
before
we
sailed
i
lived
with
roscombe
with
whom
i
came
to
england
she
was
very
kind
to
me
i
was
very
fond
of
her
and
who
was
mrs
roscombe
i
did
know
at
the
time
of
course
i
only
knew
she
was
roscombe
but
ashton
told
me
not
long
before
his
death
who
she
was
she
was
the
widow
of
some
government
official
and
she
was
returning
to
england
in
consequence
of
his
death
so
she
took
charge
of
me
and
brought
me
over
she
used
to
visit
me
regularly
at
school
every
week
and
i
used
to
spend
my
holidays
with
her
until
she
died
ah
said
carless
she
is
dead
she
died
two
years
ago
answered
miss
wickham
i
wish
she
had
been
living
observed
carless
with
a
glance
at
pawle
i
should
have
liked
to
see
roscombe
well
he
continued
turning
to
miss
wickham
so
roscombe
brought
you
to
england
to
school
what
school
ryedene
school
ryedene
that
one
of
the
most
expensive
schools
in
england
is
it
i
do
know
i
perhaps
it
is
i
happen
to
know
it
is
said
carless
dryly
two
of
my
clients
have
daughters
there
now
i
seen
their
bills
do
you
know
who
paid
yours
no
she
answered
i
do
know
ashton
i
suppose
you
had
everything
you
wanted
i
dare
say
clothes
and
so
on
i
always
had
everything
i
wanted
replied
miss
wickham
and
you
were
at
ryedene
twelve
years
except
for
the
holidays
yes
you
must
be
a
very
learned
young
lady
suggested
carless
miss
wickham
looked
round
the
circle
of
attentive
faces
i
can
play
tennis
and
hockey
very
well
she
said
smiling
a
little
and
i
was
bad
at
cricket
the
last
season
or
two
we
played
cricket
there
but
i
not
up
to
much
at
anything
else
except
that
i
can
talk
french
decently
physical
culture
eh
observed
carless
smiling
very
well
now
then
in
the
end
ashton
came
home
to
england
and
of
course
came
to
see
you
and
in
due
course
you
left
school
and
came
to
his
house
in
markendale
square
where
he
got
a
killenhall
to
look
after
you
all
that
correct
yes
well
then
i
think
from
what
pawle
tells
me
ashton
handed
over
a
lot
of
money
to
you
and
told
you
it
had
been
left
to
you
or
left
in
his
charge
for
you
by
your
father
that
is
correct
too
very
well
now
did
ashton
never
tell
you
anything
much
about
your
father
no
he
never
did
beyond
telling
me
that
my
father
was
an
englishman
who
had
gone
out
to
australia
and
settled
there
he
never
told
me
anything
but
here
miss
wickham
paused
and
hesitated
for
a
while
i
have
an
idea
she
continued
in
the
end
that
he
meant
to
tell
me
something
what
i
of
course
do
know
he
once
or
twice
hinted
that
he
would
tell
me
something
some
day
you
did
press
him
suggested
carless
i
do
think
i
am
naturally
inquisitive
replied
miss
wickham
i
certainly
did
not
press
him
i
knew
he
tell
me
whatever
it
was
in
his
own
way
one
or
two
other
questions
said
carless
do
you
know
who
your
mother
was
only
that
she
was
some
one
whom
my
father
met
in
australia
do
you
know
what
her
maiden
name
was
no
only
her
christian
name
that
was
catherine
she
and
my
father
are
buried
together
ah
exclaimed
carless
that
is
something
else
i
was
going
to
ask
you
know
where
they
are
buried
oh
yes
because
before
we
sailed
roscombe
took
me
to
the
churchyard
or
cemetery
to
see
my
father
and
mother
grave
i
remembered
that
perfectly
her
own
husband
was
buried
there
too
close
by
i
remember
how
we
both
cried
carless
suddenly
pointed
to
the
ornament
which
miss
wickham
was
wearing
will
you
take
that
off
and
let
me
look
at
it
he
asked
thank
you
he
said
as
she
somewhat
surprisedly
obeyed
i
believe
he
continued
as
he
quietly
passed
the
ornament
to
lord
ellingham
that
ashton
gave
you
this
and
told
you
it
had
belonged
to
your
father
just
so
well
he
concluded
handing
the
ornament
back
i
think
that
all
much
obliged
to
you
miss
wickham
you
wo
understand
all
this
but
you
will
later
now
one
of
my
clerks
will
get
you
a
car
and
we
escort
you
down
to
it
no
said
lord
ellingham
promptly
jumping
to
his
feet
allow
me
youngest
if
miss
wickham
will
let
me
the
two
young
people
went
out
of
the
room
together
and
the
three
men
left
behind
looked
at
each
other
there
was
a
brief
and
significant
silence
well
carless
said
pawle
at
last
how
now
my
honour
answered
carless
i
should
wonder
if
you
right
chapter
xx
surprising
readiness
pawle
made
a
gesture
which
seemed
to
denote
a
certain
amount
of
triumphant
i
sure
i
right
he
exclaimed
you
find
out
that
i
right
but
there
a
tremendous
lot
to
do
carless
if
only
that
unfortunate
man
ashton
had
lived
he
could
have
cleared
this
matter
up
at
once
i
feel
convinced
that
he
possessed
papers
which
would
have
proved
this
claim
beyond
dispute
those
papers
of
course
now
what
particular
papers
are
you
thinking
of
interrupted
carless
well
replied
pawle
such
papers
as
proofs
of
her
marriage
and
of
her
own
birth
according
to
what
she
told
us
just
now
her
father
was
married
in
australia
and
she
herself
was
born
there
there
must
be
documentary
proof
of
that
her
father
was
probably
married
under
his
assumed
name
of
wickham
observed
carless
you
have
to
prove
that
wickham
and
lord
marketstoke
were
identical
were
one
and
the
same
person
the
fact
is
pawle
if
this
girl
claim
is
persisted
in
there
have
to
be
a
very
searching
inquiry
made
in
australia
however
much
i
may
feel
that
your
theory
may
be
probably
is
right
i
should
have
to
advise
my
client
lord
ellingham
to
insist
on
the
most
complete
investigation
to
be
sure
to
be
sure
assented
pawle
that
absolutely
necessary
but
my
own
impression
is
that
as
we
get
into
the
secret
of
ashton
murder
as
i
make
no
doubt
we
shall
there
will
be
more
evidence
forthcoming
now
as
regards
this
man
whoever
he
is
who
claims
to
be
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
at
that
moment
a
clerk
entered
the
room
and
glanced
at
carless
telephone
message
from
methley
and
woodlesford
sir
he
announced
methley
compliments
and
if
agreeable
to
you
he
can
bring
his
client
on
to
see
you
this
afternoon
at
once
if
convenient
carless
looked
at
pawle
and
pawle
nodded
a
silent
assent
tell
methley
it
quite
agreeable
and
convenient
answered
carless
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
them
both
at
once
um
he
muttered
when
the
clerk
had
withdrawn
somewhat
sudden
eh
pawle
you
might
almost
call
it
suspicious
alacrity
evidently
the
gentleman
has
no
fear
of
meeting
us
you
may
be
quite
certain
carless
if
my
theory
about
the
whole
thing
is
a
sound
theory
that
the
gentleman
will
have
no
fear
of
meeting
anybody
not
even
a
judge
and
jury
answered
pawle
sardonically
if
i
apprehend
things
rightly
he
have
been
very
carefully
coached
and
prepared
you
think
there
a
secret
conspiracy
behind
all
this
suggested
carless
with
this
claimant
as
well
tutored
to
his
task
i
do
affirmed
pawle
emphatically
i
do
aye
well
said
carless
do
forget
what
i
told
you
about
the
missing
finger
middle
finger
of
the
right
hand
and
i
have
driver
in
here
and
portlethwaite
too
we
see
if
he
knows
which
is
which
of
the
three
of
us
i
go
and
prepare
them
he
returned
presently
with
his
partner
a
quiet
elderly
man
a
few
minutes
later
portlethwaite
evidently
keenly
interested
joined
them
they
and
pawle
began
to
discuss
certain
legal
matters
connected
with
the
immediate
business
and
viner
purposely
withdrew
to
a
corner
of
the
room
intent
on
silently
watching
whatever
followed
on
the
arrival
of
the
visitors
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
methley
was
shown
into
the
room
and
the
five
men
gathered
there
turned
with
one
accord
to
look
at
his
companion
a
tall
slightly
man
of
distinctly
appearance
who
viner
saw
at
once
was
much
more
and
assured
in
manner
than
any
of
the
men
who
rose
to
meet
him
my
client
cave
who
claims
to
be
earl
of
ellingham
said
methley
by
way
of
introduction
mr
car
but
the
other
man
smiled
quietly
and
immediately
assumed
a
lead
there
is
no
need
of
introduction
methley
he
said
i
remember
all
three
gentlemen
perfectly
carless
driver
and
yes
to
be
sure
portlethwaite
i
have
a
good
memory
for
faces
he
bowed
to
each
man
as
he
named
him
and
smiled
again
whether
these
gentlemen
remember
me
as
well
as
i
remember
them
he
remarked
is
another
question
may
i
offer
you
a
chair
said
carless
the
visitor
bowed
sat
down
and
took
off
his
gloves
and
in
the
silence
which
followed
viner
saw
that
the
eyes
of
driver
carless
pawle
and
portlethwaite
were
all
steadily
directed
on
the
claimant
right
hand
he
himself
turned
to
it
too
with
no
small
interest
the
next
instant
he
was
conscious
that
an
atmosphere
of
astonishment
and
surprise
had
been
set
up
in
that
room
for
the
middle
finger
of
the
man
right
hand
was
missing
viner
felt
rather
than
saw
that
the
three
solicitors
and
the
elderly
clerk
were
exchanging
glances
of
amazement
and
he
fancied
that
carless
voice
which
had
sounded
cold
and
noncommittal
as
he
offered
the
visitor
a
seat
was
somewhat
uncertain
when
he
turned
to
address
him
you
claim
sir
to
be
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
so
many
years
ago
he
asked
eyeing
the
claimant
over
i
claim
to
be
exactly
what
i
am
carless
answered
the
visitor
with
another
ready
and
pleasant
smile
i
hope
your
memory
will
come
to
your
aid
when
a
man
has
disappeared
absolutely
for
something
like
years
remarked
carless
those
whom
he
has
left
behind
may
well
be
excused
if
their
memories
do
readily
respond
to
sudden
demands
but
i
should
like
to
ask
you
some
questions
did
you
see
the
advertisements
which
were
issued
broadcast
at
the
time
of
the
seventh
earl
of
ellingham
death
yes
in
several
english
and
colonial
papers
answered
the
claimant
why
did
you
not
reply
to
them
at
that
time
i
still
persevered
in
my
intention
of
never
again
having
anything
to
do
with
my
old
life
i
had
no
desire
at
all
to
come
forward
and
claim
my
rights
so
i
took
no
notice
of
your
advertisements
and
since
then
of
late
to
be
exact
you
have
changed
your
mind
suggested
carless
dryly
to
a
certain
extent
only
replied
the
visitor
whose
calm
assurance
was
evidently
impressing
the
legal
practitioners
around
him
i
have
already
told
methley
and
his
partner
woodlesford
that
i
have
no
desire
to
assume
my
title
nor
to
require
possession
of
the
estates
which
are
certainly
mine
i
have
lived
a
free
life
too
long
to
wish
for
what
i
should
come
in
for
if
i
established
my
claim
but
i
have
a
right
to
a
share
in
the
property
which
i
quite
willingly
resign
to
my
nephew
in
plain
language
said
carless
if
you
are
paid
a
certain
considerable
sum
of
money
you
will
vanish
again
into
the
obscurity
from
whence
you
came
am
i
right
in
that
supposition
i
do
like
your
terminology
carless
answered
the
visitor
with
a
slight
frown
i
have
not
lived
in
obscurity
and
if
you
are
what
you
claim
to
be
sir
you
are
earl
of
ellingham
said
carless
firmly
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
at
once
that
if
you
prove
to
us
that
you
are
your
nephew
who
now
holds
title
and
estates
will
at
once
relinquish
both
there
will
be
no
bargaining
it
is
all
or
nothing
our
client
whom
we
know
as
earl
of
ellingham
is
not
going
to
traffic
if
you
are
what
you
claim
to
be
you
are
head
of
the
family
and
must
take
your
place
we
could
have
told
you
that
once
for
all
if
you
had
come
to
us
in
the
first
instance
remarked
driver
any
other
idea
is
out
of
the
question
it
seems
to
me
most
remarkable
that
such
a
notion
as
that
which
you
suggest
should
ever
enter
your
head
sir
if
you
are
earl
of
ellingham
you
are
and
that
reminds
me
said
carless
that
there
is
another
question
i
should
like
to
ask
why
knowing
that
we
have
been
legal
advisers
to
your
family
for
several
generations
did
you
not
come
straight
to
us
instead
of
going
methley
i
sure
will
pardon
me
to
a
firm
of
solicitors
which
as
far
as
i
know
has
never
had
any
connection
with
it
i
thought
it
best
to
employ
absolutely
independent
advice
replied
the
visitor
and
i
still
think
i
was
right
for
example
you
evidently
do
not
admit
my
claim
we
certainly
admit
nothing
at
present
declared
carless
with
a
laugh
it
would
be
absurd
to
expect
it
the
proofs
which
your
solicitors
showed
us
this
morning
are
no
proofs
at
all
that
those
papers
belonged
to
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
there
is
no
doubt
but
your
possession
of
them
at
present
does
not
prove
that
you
are
lord
marketstoke
or
lord
ellingham
they
may
have
been
stolen
the
claimant
rose
from
his
chair
with
a
good
deal
of
dignity
he
glanced
at
methley
i
do
not
see
that
any
good
can
come
of
this
interview
methley
he
remarked
in
quiet
level
tones
i
am
evidently
to
be
treated
as
an
impostor
in
that
case
he
bowed
ceremoniously
to
the
men
gathered
around
carless
desk
i
think
it
best
to
withdraw
therewith
he
walked
out
of
the
room
and
methley
after
a
quiet
word
with
carless
followed
to
be
stopped
in
the
corridor
for
a
second
time
that
day
by
viner
who
had
hurried
after
him
i
not
going
to
express
any
opinion
on
what
we
just
heard
whispered
viner
drawing
methley
aside
but
in
view
of
what
i
told
you
this
morning
there
something
i
want
you
to
do
for
me
yes
said
methley
what
that
unlucky
fellow
hyde
who
is
on
remand
is
to
be
brought
before
the
magistrate
tomorrow
morning
answered
viner
get
him
this
claimant
there
to
attend
the
court
as
a
spectator
go
with
him
use
any
argument
you
like
but
get
him
there
i
a
reason
which
i
explain
later
i
do
my
best
promised
methley
and
i
an
idea
of
what
on
your
mind
you
want
to
find
out
if
hyde
can
recognize
him
as
the
man
whom
he
met
at
the
markendale
square
end
of
lonsdale
passage
well
that
is
my
idea
assented
viner
so
get
him
there
methley
nodded
and
turned
away
then
he
turned
back
and
pointed
at
carless
room
what
do
they
really
think
in
there
he
whispered
tell
me
between
ourselves
that
he
is
an
impostor
and
that
there
a
conspiracy
replied
viner
methley
nodded
again
and
viner
went
back
the
men
whom
he
had
left
were
talking
excitedly
it
was
the
only
course
to
take
carless
was
declaring
uncompromising
hostility
we
could
do
no
other
you
saw
quite
well
that
he
was
all
for
money
i
will
engage
that
we
could
have
settled
with
him
for
one
half
of
what
he
asked
but
who
is
he
the
middle
finger
of
his
right
hand
is
gone
said
pawle
who
had
been
very
quiet
and
thoughtful
during
the
recent
proceedings
remember
that
carless
a
most
extraordinary
coincidence
exclaimed
carless
excitedly
i
do
care
twopence
what
anybody
says
we
all
know
that
the
most
surprising
coincidences
do
occur
nothing
but
a
coincidence
i
assert
what
is
it
portlethwaite
the
elderly
clerk
had
been
manifesting
a
strong
desire
to
get
in
a
word
and
he
now
rapped
his
senior
employer
elbow
carless
he
said
earnestly
you
know
that
before
i
came
to
you
now
nearly
forty
years
ago
i
was
a
medical
student
you
know
too
you
and
driver
why
i
gave
up
medicine
for
the
law
but
i
forgotten
all
of
that
i
learned
in
the
medical
schools
and
the
hospitals
well
portlethwaite
demanded
carless
what
is
it
some
idea
gentlemen
answered
the
elderly
clerk
i
was
always
particularly
interested
in
anatomy
in
my
medical
student
days
i
been
looking
attentively
at
what
i
could
see
of
that
man
injured
finger
since
he
sat
down
at
that
desk
and
i
lay
all
i
have
that
he
lost
the
two
joints
of
that
finger
within
the
last
three
months
the
scar
over
the
stump
had
not
long
been
healed
that
a
fact
carless
looked
round
with
a
triumphant
smile
there
he
exclaimed
what
did
i
tell
you
coincidence
nothing
but
coincidence
but
portlethwaite
shook
his
head
why
not
say
design
mr
carless
he
said
meaningly
why
not
say
design
if
this
man
or
the
people
who
are
behind
him
knew
that
the
real
lord
marketstoke
had
a
finger
missing
what
easier
in
view
of
the
stake
they
playing
for
than
to
remove
one
of
this
man
fingers
design
sir
design
all
part
of
the
scheme
the
elderly
clerk
listeners
looked
at
each
other
i
tell
you
what
it
is
exclaimed
pawle
with
sudden
emphasis
the
more
we
see
and
hear
of
this
affair
the
more
i
convinced
that
it
is
as
portlethwaite
says
a
conspiracy
you
know
that
fellow
who
has
just
been
here
was
distinctly
taken
aback
when
you
carless
informed
him
that
it
was
going
to
be
a
case
of
all
or
nothing
he
or
the
folk
behind
him
evidently
expected
that
they
be
able
to
effect
a
money
settlement
now
i
should
say
that
the
real
reason
of
his
somewhat
hasty
retirement
was
that
he
wanted
to
consult
his
principal
or
principals
did
you
notice
that
he
was
not
really
affronted
by
your
remark
not
he
his
personal
dignity
was
ruffled
a
bit
he
was
taken
aback
he
gone
off
to
consult
carless
you
ought
to
have
that
man
carefully
shadowed
to
see
where
and
to
whom
he
goes
good
idea
muttered
driver
we
might
see
to
that
i
can
put
a
splendid
man
on
to
him
at
once
carless
remarked
portlethwaite
if
you
could
furnish
me
with
his
address
methley
and
woodlesford
know
it
said
carless
um
yes
that
might
be
very
useful
ring
methley
up
portlethwaite
and
ask
if
they
would
oblige
us
with
the
name
of
cave
hotel
some
residential
hotel
in
lancaster
gate
i
believe
pawle
and
viner
went
away
ruminating
over
the
recent
events
and
walked
to
the
old
lawyer
offices
in
bedford
row
pawle
own
particular
clerk
met
them
as
they
entered
there
roland
perkwite
of
the
middle
temple
in
your
room
sir
he
said
addressing
his
master
you
may
remember
him
sir
we
briefed
him
once
or
twice
in
some
small
cases
perkwite
wants
to
see
you
about
this
ashton
affair
he
says
he
something
to
tell
you
pawle
looked
at
viner
and
beckoned
him
to
follow
here
a
little
and
there
a
little
he
whispered
what
are
we
going
to
hear
this
time
chapter
xxi
the
marseilles
meeting
the
man
who
was
waiting
in
pawle
room
and
who
rose
from
his
chair
with
alacrity
as
the
old
lawyer
entered
with
viner
at
his
heels
was
an
alert
person
of
something
under
whose
countenance
and
general
air
immediately
suggested
the
law
courts
and
he
went
straight
to
business
before
he
had
released
the
hand
which
pawle
extended
to
him
your
clerk
has
no
doubt
already
told
you
what
i
came
about
mr
pawle
he
said
this
ashton
affair
just
so
answered
pawle
you
know
something
about
it
this
gentleman
is
richard
viner
who
is
interested
in
it
considerably
to
be
sure
said
the
barrister
one
of
the
witnesses
of
course
i
read
the
whole
thing
up
last
night
i
have
been
on
the
continent
the
french
riviera
italy
the
austrian
tyrol
for
some
time
pawle
and
only
returned
to
town
yesterday
i
saw
something
in
an
english
newspaper
in
paris
the
other
day
about
this
ashton
business
and
as
my
clerk
keeps
the
for
me
when
i
am
absent
last
night
i
read
over
the
proceedings
before
the
magistrate
and
before
the
coroner
and
of
course
i
saw
your
request
for
information
about
ashton
and
his
recent
movements
and
you
some
to
give
asked
pawle
i
have
some
to
give
assented
perkwite
as
the
three
men
sat
down
by
pawle
desk
certainly
and
i
should
say
it
of
considerable
importance
the
fact
is
i
met
ashton
at
marseilles
and
spent
the
better
part
of
the
week
in
his
company
at
the
hotel
de
louvre
there
when
was
that
asked
pawle
about
three
months
ago
replied
the
barrister
i
had
gone
straight
to
marseilles
from
london
he
had
come
there
from
italy
by
way
of
monte
carlo
and
nice
we
happened
to
get
into
conversation
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
and
we
afterwards
spent
most
of
our
time
together
and
finding
out
that
i
was
a
barrister
he
confided
certain
things
to
me
and
asked
my
advice
aye
and
on
what
now
enquired
the
old
lawyer
it
was
the
last
night
we
were
together
replied
perkwite
we
had
by
that
time
become
very
friendly
and
i
had
promised
to
renew
our
acquaintance
on
my
return
to
london
where
ashton
told
me
he
intended
to
settle
down
for
the
rest
of
his
life
now
on
that
last
evening
at
marseilles
i
had
been
telling
him
after
dinner
of
some
curious
legal
cases
and
he
suddenly
remarked
that
he
would
like
to
tell
me
of
a
matter
which
might
come
within
the
law
and
on
which
he
should
be
glad
of
advice
he
then
asked
me
if
i
had
ever
heard
of
the
strange
disappearance
of
lord
marketstoke
heir
to
the
seventh
earl
of
ellingham
i
replied
that
i
had
at
the
time
when
application
was
made
to
the
courts
for
leave
to
presume
lord
marketstoke
death
thereupon
pledging
me
to
secrecy
for
the
time
being
ashton
went
on
to
tell
me
that
lord
marketstoke
was
well
known
to
him
and
that
he
alone
knew
all
the
facts
of
the
matter
though
a
certain
amount
of
them
was
known
to
another
man
now
living
in
london
he
said
that
marketstoke
after
a
final
quarrel
with
his
father
left
england
in
such
a
fashion
that
no
one
could
trace
him
taking
with
him
the
fortune
which
he
had
inherited
from
his
mother
and
eventually
settled
in
australia
where
he
henceforth
lived
under
the
name
of
wickham
according
to
ashton
he
and
marketstoke
became
friends
close
friends
at
a
very
early
period
of
marketstoke
career
in
australia
and
the
friendship
deepened
and
existed
until
marketstoke
death
some
twelve
or
thirteen
years
ago
but
ashton
never
had
the
slightest
notion
of
marketstoke
real
identity
until
his
friend
last
days
then
marketstoke
told
him
the
plain
truth
and
the
fact
who
he
really
was
at
the
same
time
was
confided
to
another
man
who
however
was
not
told
all
the
details
which
were
given
to
ashton
now
marketstoke
had
married
in
australia
his
wife
was
dead
but
he
had
a
daughter
who
was
about
six
years
of
age
at
the
time
of
her
death
marketstoke
confided
her
to
ashton
with
a
wish
that
she
should
be
sent
home
to
england
to
be
educated
he
also
handed
over
to
ashton
a
considerable
sum
of
money
for
this
child
further
he
gave
him
a
quantity
of
papers
letters
family
documents
and
so
on
he
had
a
purpose
he
left
it
to
ashton
in
whom
he
evidently
had
the
most
absolute
confidence
as
to
whether
this
girl
claim
to
the
title
and
estates
should
be
set
up
and
when
ashton
had
finished
telling
me
all
this
i
found
that
one
of
his
principal
reasons
in
coming
to
england
to
settle
down
was
the
wish
to
find
out
how
things
were
with
the
present
holder
of
the
title
if
he
said
he
discovered
that
he
was
a
worthy
sort
of
young
fellow
he
ashton
should
be
inclined
to
let
the
secret
die
with
him
he
told
me
that
the
girl
already
had
some
twelve
thousand
pounds
of
her
own
and
that
it
was
his
intention
to
leave
her
the
whole
of
his
own
fortune
and
as
she
was
absolutely
ignorant
of
her
real
position
he
might
perhaps
leave
her
so
but
in
view
of
the
possibility
of
his
setting
up
her
claim
he
asked
me
some
questions
on
legal
points
and
of
course
i
asked
him
to
let
me
see
the
papers
of
which
he
had
spoken
ah
exclaimed
pawle
with
a
sigh
of
relieved
satisfaction
then
you
saw
them
yes
he
showed
me
the
whole
lot
replied
perkwite
not
so
many
after
all
those
that
were
really
pertinent
at
any
rate
he
carried
those
in
a
pocketbook
had
so
carried
them
he
told
me
ever
since
marketstoke
had
handed
them
to
him
they
had
never
he
added
been
out
of
his
possession
day
or
night
since
marketstoke
death
now
on
examining
the
papers
i
at
once
discovered
two
highly
important
facts
although
marketstoke
went
to
and
lived
in
australia
under
the
name
of
wickham
he
had
taken
good
care
to
get
married
in
his
own
proper
name
and
there
amongst
the
documents
was
the
marriage
certificate
in
which
he
was
correctly
described
further
his
daughter
had
been
correctly
designated
in
the
register
of
her
birth
there
was
a
copy
properly
attested
of
the
entry
pawle
glanced
at
viner
and
viner
knew
what
he
was
thinking
of
the
two
documents
just
described
by
perkwite
had
not
been
among
the
papers
which
methley
and
woodlesford
had
exhibited
at
carless
driver
office
a
moment
said
pawle
lifting
an
arresting
finger
did
you
happen
to
notice
where
this
marriage
took
place
it
was
not
in
melbourne
replied
perkwite
my
recollection
is
that
it
was
at
some
place
of
a
curious
name
ashton
told
me
that
marketstoke
wife
had
been
a
governess
in
the
family
of
some
she
was
an
english
girl
and
an
orphan
the
child
however
was
certainly
born
in
melbourne
and
registered
in
melbourne
now
that
odd
remarked
pawle
you
have
thought
that
when
lord
marketstoke
was
so
extensively
advertised
for
some
years
ago
on
the
death
of
his
father
some
of
these
officials
ah
i
put
that
point
to
ashton
interrupted
perkwite
he
said
that
marketstoke
though
he
had
taken
good
care
to
be
married
in
his
own
name
and
had
exercised
equal
precaution
about
his
daughter
had
pledged
everybody
connected
with
his
marriage
and
the
child
birth
to
secrecy
aye
muttered
pawle
he
would
do
that
of
course
but
continue
well
said
the
barrister
after
seeing
these
papers
i
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
the
case
as
presented
by
ashton
was
quite
clear
and
that
his
ward
miss
avice
wickham
is
without
doubt
countess
of
ellingham
the
title
i
understand
going
in
the
female
as
well
as
the
male
line
and
rightful
owner
of
the
estates
and
i
told
him
that
his
best
plan
on
reaching
england
was
to
put
the
whole
matter
before
the
family
solicitors
however
he
said
that
before
doing
that
there
were
two
things
he
wanted
to
do
one
was
to
find
out
for
himself
how
things
were
if
the
young
earl
was
a
satisfactory
landlord
and
so
on
and
likely
to
be
a
credit
to
the
family
the
other
was
that
he
wanted
to
consult
the
man
who
shared
with
him
the
bare
knowledge
that
the
man
who
had
been
known
in
melbourne
as
wickham
was
really
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
and
he
added
that
he
had
already
telegraphed
to
this
man
to
meet
him
in
paris
ah
exclaimed
pawle
with
a
look
in
viner
direction
now
we
are
indeed
coming
to
something
he
was
to
meet
him
in
paris
viner
i
wager
the
world
against
a
china
orange
that
that
the
man
whom
armitstead
saw
in
company
with
ashton
in
the
rue
royale
and
no
doubt
the
man
of
lonsdale
passage
perkwite
this
is
most
important
did
ashton
tell
you
the
name
of
this
man
the
old
lawyer
was
tremulous
with
excited
interest
and
perkwite
was
obviously
sorry
to
disappoint
him
unfortunately
he
did
not
he
replied
he
merely
told
me
that
he
was
a
man
who
had
lived
in
melbourne
for
some
time
and
had
known
marketstoke
and
himself
very
intimately
had
left
melbourne
just
after
death
and
had
settled
in
london
no
he
did
not
mention
his
name
disappointing
muttered
pawle
that
the
nearest
approach
to
a
clue
that
we
had
perkwite
if
we
only
knew
who
that
man
was
but
what
more
can
you
tell
us
nothing
more
i
afraid
answered
the
barrister
i
promised
to
call
on
ashton
when
i
returned
to
london
and
when
he
started
housekeeping
and
we
parted
i
went
on
next
morning
to
genoa
and
he
set
off
for
paris
he
was
a
pleasant
kindly
sociable
fellow
concluded
perkwite
and
i
was
much
grieved
to
hear
of
his
sad
fate
he
did
correspond
with
you
at
all
after
you
left
him
at
marseilles
asked
pawle
no
replied
the
barrister
no
i
never
heard
of
or
from
him
until
i
read
of
his
murder
pawle
turned
to
viner
i
think
we
better
tell
perkwite
of
all
that
happened
within
our
own
ken
he
said
and
proceeded
to
give
the
visitor
a
brief
account
of
the
various
important
details
now
he
concluded
it
seems
to
me
only
one
conclusion
to
be
arrived
at
the
man
who
shared
the
secret
with
ashton
is
certainly
the
man
whom
armitstead
saw
with
him
in
paris
he
is
probably
the
man
whom
hyde
saw
leaving
londsdale
passage
just
before
hyde
found
the
body
and
he
is
without
doubt
the
murderer
and
is
the
man
to
whom
this
claimant
fellow
is
acting
as
and
who
is
he
there
must
be
some
way
of
finding
that
out
observed
perkwite
if
your
theory
is
correct
that
this
claimant
is
merely
a
man
who
is
being
put
forward
then
surely
the
thing
to
do
is
to
get
at
the
person
or
persons
behind
him
through
him
aye
there
that
to
be
thought
of
asserted
pawle
but
it
may
be
a
tougher
job
than
we
think
for
it
would
have
been
a
tremendous
help
if
ashton
had
only
mentioned
a
name
to
you
sorry
but
he
did
said
perkwite
you
feel
he
continued
after
a
moment
silence
you
feel
that
this
affair
of
the
ellingham
succession
lies
at
the
root
of
the
ashton
mystery
that
he
was
really
murdered
by
somebody
who
wanted
to
get
possession
of
those
papers
and
to
remain
sole
repository
of
the
secret
declared
pawle
it
established
that
beyond
yourself
and
this
unknown
man
nobody
but
ashton
knew
the
secret
there
is
another
matter
though
remarked
viner
he
turned
to
the
visitor
you
said
that
you
and
ashton
became
very
friendly
and
confidential
during
your
stay
in
marseilles
pray
did
he
never
show
you
anything
of
a
valuable
nature
which
he
carried
in
his
pocketbook
the
barrister
keen
eyes
suddenly
lighted
up
with
recollection
yes
he
exclaimed
now
you
come
to
suggest
it
he
did
a
diamond
ah
said
pawle
so
you
saw
that
yes
i
saw
it
assented
perkwite
he
showed
it
to
me
as
a
sort
of
curiosity
a
stone
which
had
some
romantic
history
attaching
to
it
but
i
was
not
half
as
much
interested
in
that
as
in
the
other
affair
all
the
same
remarked
pawle
that
diamond
is
worth
some
fifty
or
sixty
thousand
pounds
perkwite
and
it
missing
perkwite
looked
his
astonishment
you
mean
he
had
it
on
him
when
he
was
murdered
he
asked
so
it
believed
replied
pawle
in
that
case
it
might
form
a
clue
said
the
barrister
when
it
heard
of
admitted
pawle
with
a
grim
smile
not
till
then
from
what
we
have
heard
remarked
viner
ashton
carried
that
diamond
in
the
pocketbook
which
contained
his
papers
the
papers
you
have
told
me
of
and
some
of
which
have
certainly
come
into
possession
of
this
claimant
person
now
whoever
stole
the
papers
of
course
got
the
diamond
perkwite
seemed
to
consider
matters
during
a
moment
silence
finally
he
turned
to
the
old
lawyer
i
have
been
thinking
over
something
that
might
be
done
he
said
i
see
that
the
coroner
inquest
was
adjourned
now
as
that
inquest
is
of
course
being
held
to
inquire
into
the
circumstances
of
ashton
death
i
suggest
that
i
should
come
forward
as
a
witness
and
should
prove
that
ashton
showed
certain
papers
relating
to
the
ellingham
peerage
to
me
at
marseilles
i
can
tell
the
story
as
a
witness
it
can
then
be
proved
by
you
or
by
carless
that
a
man
claiming
to
be
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
showed
these
stolen
papers
to
you
in
the
meantime
get
the
coroner
to
summon
this
man
as
a
witness
and
take
care
that
he
brought
to
the
court
once
there
let
him
be
asked
how
he
came
into
possession
of
these
papers
do
you
see
my
idea
capital
exclaimed
pawle
an
excellent
notion
much
obliged
to
you
perkwite
it
shall
be
done
i
see
to
it
at
once
yes
to
be
sure
that
will
put
this
fellow
in
a
tight
corner
do
be
surprised
if
he
has
some
very
clever
explanation
to
give
said
the
barrister
warningly
the
whole
thing
is
evidently
a
conspiracy
but
when
is
the
adjourned
inquest
day
after
tomorrow
replied
pawle
after
glancing
at
his
and
tomorrow
morning
remarked
viner
hyde
comes
up
before
the
magistrate
again
on
remand
he
was
to
tell
pawle
there
and
then
of
his
secret
dealings
with
methley
that
day
but
on
reflection
he
decided
that
he
would
keep
the
matter
to
himself
viner
had
an
idea
which
he
had
not
communicated
even
to
methley
it
had
struck
him
that
the
mysterious
ex
who
was
certainly
at
the
back
of
all
this
business
might
not
improbably
be
so
anxious
about
his
schemes
that
he
would
unknown
and
unsuspected
attend
the
magistrates
court
would
hyde
his
wits
sharpened
by
danger
be
able
to
spot
him
as
the
muffled
man
of
lonsdale
passage
chapter
xxii
on
remand
when
langton
hyde
was
brought
up
before
the
magistrate
next
morning
the
court
was
crowded
to
its
utmost
limits
and
viner
looking
round
him
from
his
seat
near
the
solicitors
table
saw
that
most
of
the
people
interested
in
the
case
were
present
carless
was
whispering
with
pawle
lord
ellingham
had
a
seat
close
by
in
the
front
of
the
public
gallery
miss
penkridge
grim
and
alert
was
in
charge
of
the
timid
and
shrinking
sisters
of
the
unfortunate
prisoner
there
too
were
armitstead
and
isidore
rosenbaum
and
perkwite
all
evidently
very
much
alive
to
certain
possibilities
but
viner
looked
in
vain
for
either
methley
or
woodlesford
or
their
mysterious
client
they
were
certainly
not
present
when
hyde
was
put
into
the
dock
and
viner
began
to
wonder
if
the
events
of
the
previous
day
had
warned
cave
and
those
behind
him
to
avoid
publicity
instructed
by
viner
who
was
determined
to
spare
neither
effort
nor
money
to
clear
his
old
schoolmate
felpham
had
engaged
the
services
of
one
of
the
most
brilliant
criminal
barristers
of
the
day
on
behalf
of
his
client
and
he
and
viner
had
sat
up
half
the
night
with
him
instructing
him
in
the
various
mysteries
and
ramifications
of
the
case
a
big
man
made
no
sign
and
to
all
outward
appearance
showed
no
very
great
interest
while
the
counsel
who
now
appeared
on
behalf
of
the
police
completed
his
case
against
the
prisoner
the
only
new
evidence
produced
by
the
prosecution
was
that
of
the
greengrocer
on
whose
premises
hyde
had
admitted
that
he
passed
most
of
the
night
of
the
murder
and
in
whose
shed
the
missing
valuables
had
been
found
the
greengrocer
evidence
as
to
his
discovery
was
given
in
a
plain
and
straightforward
fashion
he
was
evidently
a
man
who
would
just
tell
what
he
actually
saw
and
brought
neither
fancy
nor
imagination
to
bear
on
his
observation
but
when
the
prosecution
had
done
with
him
rose
and
quietly
asked
the
police
to
produce
the
watch
chain
and
ring
which
the
greengrocer
had
found
in
their
original
wrappings
he
held
up
the
to
the
witness
and
asked
him
if
he
could
swear
that
this
was
what
he
had
found
the
valuables
in
and
had
given
to
the
police
the
greengrocer
was
positive
as
to
this
he
was
positive
too
that
the
other
wrappings
which
felpham
had
carefully
preserved
were
those
which
had
been
on
the
outside
of
the
parcel
and
had
been
thrown
aside
by
himself
on
its
discovery
and
afterwards
picked
up
by
viner
handed
all
these
papers
up
to
the
magistrate
directing
his
attention
to
the
strong
odour
of
drugs
or
chemicals
which
still
pervaded
them
and
to
the
address
of
the
manufacturing
chemists
which
appeared
on
the
outer
wrapping
the
magistrate
seemed
somewhat
mystified
what
is
the
object
of
this
he
asked
glancing
at
the
defending
counsel
it
is
admitted
that
these
are
the
wrappings
in
which
the
watch
and
chain
and
ring
were
found
in
the
witness
shed
but
he
paused
with
another
inquiring
look
you
propose
to
what
he
asked
i
propose
your
worship
to
prove
that
these
things
were
never
put
there
by
the
prisoner
at
all
answered
promptly
and
with
an
assurance
which
was
not
lost
on
the
spectators
i
intend
to
show
that
they
were
purposely
placed
in
that
outhouse
by
the
real
murderer
of
john
ashton
after
the
statement
made
by
the
prisoner
at
the
inquest
became
public
placed
there
of
course
to
divert
any
possible
suspicion
of
himself
and
now
he
continued
after
the
greengrocer
had
left
the
box
and
the
prosecuting
counsel
had
intimated
that
he
had
no
more
evidence
to
bring
forward
at
present
now
i
will
outline
the
defence
which
i
shall
set
up
on
behalf
of
my
client
i
intend
to
prove
that
john
ashton
was
murdered
by
some
man
not
yet
discovered
who
killed
him
in
order
to
gain
possession
of
certain
papers
which
he
carried
on
him
papers
of
extreme
importance
as
will
be
shown
we
know
where
certain
of
those
papers
are
and
we
hope
before
very
long
to
know
where
the
rest
are
and
also
where
a
certain
very
valuable
diamond
is
which
the
murdered
man
had
on
him
at
the
time
of
his
death
i
shall
indeed
prove
that
the
prisoner
certainly
through
his
own
foolishness
is
wrongly
accused
it
will
be
within
your
worship
recollection
that
when
the
prisoner
was
first
before
you
he
very
unwisely
refused
to
give
his
name
and
address
or
any
information
he
subsequently
repented
of
that
and
made
a
statement
not
only
to
the
police
but
before
the
coroner
now
i
propose
to
put
him
into
that
box
so
that
he
may
give
evidence
and
i
shall
then
call
certain
witnesses
who
will
offer
evidence
which
will
go
to
prove
that
what
i
say
as
regards
the
murder
of
ashton
is
more
than
probable
namely
that
he
was
murdered
for
the
sake
of
the
documents
he
had
on
him
and
that
the
spoiling
of
his
money
and
valuables
was
a
mere
piece
of
bluff
intended
to
mislead
let
the
prisoner
go
into
the
box
there
was
a
continued
deep
silence
in
court
while
hyde
under
examination
repeated
the
story
which
he
had
told
to
viner
and
drillford
and
before
the
coroner
and
his
jury
it
was
a
plain
consecutive
story
in
which
he
set
forth
the
circumstances
preceding
the
evening
of
the
murder
and
confessed
his
picking
up
of
the
ring
which
lay
on
the
pavement
by
ashton
body
he
kept
his
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
under
this
examination
never
removing
them
from
him
save
when
the
magistrate
interposed
with
an
occasional
remark
or
question
but
at
one
point
a
slight
commotion
in
court
caused
him
to
look
among
the
spectators
and
viner
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
saw
him
start
and
at
the
same
instant
saw
what
it
was
that
he
started
at
methley
followed
by
the
claimant
was
quietly
pushing
a
way
through
the
throng
between
the
door
and
the
solicitor
table
viner
leaned
closer
to
pawle
do
you
see
he
whispered
hyde
evidently
recognizes
one
of
those
two
now
which
pawle
glanced
at
the
prisoner
hyde
face
hitherto
pale
had
flushed
a
little
and
his
eyes
had
grown
bright
he
looked
as
if
he
had
suddenly
seen
a
friend
face
in
a
hostile
crowd
but
who
had
been
bending
over
his
papers
suddenly
looked
up
with
another
question
and
hyde
again
turned
his
attention
to
him
all
that
you
really
know
of
this
matter
asked
is
that
you
chanced
to
turn
up
lonsdale
passage
saw
a
man
lying
on
the
pavement
and
a
ring
close
by
and
that
being
literally
starving
and
desperate
you
snatched
up
that
ring
and
ran
away
as
fast
as
you
could
yes
that
is
all
asserted
hyde
except
that
i
had
met
a
man
as
i
have
already
told
you
at
the
end
of
the
passage
by
which
i
entered
you
did
not
even
know
whether
this
man
lying
on
the
pavement
was
alive
or
dead
i
thought
he
might
be
drunk
replied
hyde
but
after
i
had
snatched
up
the
ring
i
never
thought
at
all
until
i
had
run
some
distance
i
was
afraid
of
being
followed
now
why
were
you
afraid
of
being
followed
i
was
famishing
answered
hyde
i
knew
i
could
get
something
some
money
on
that
ring
in
the
morning
and
i
wanted
to
stick
to
it
i
was
afraid
that
the
man
whom
i
met
as
i
ran
out
of
the
passage
whom
i
now
know
to
have
been
viner
might
follow
me
and
make
me
give
up
the
ring
and
the
ring
meant
food
let
this
answer
sink
into
the
prevalent
atmosphere
and
suddenly
turned
to
another
matter
the
knife
which
had
been
found
in
hyde
possession
was
lying
with
certain
other
exhibits
on
the
solicitor
table
and
pointed
to
it
now
about
that
knife
he
said
it
is
yours
very
well
how
long
have
you
had
it
three
or
four
years
replied
hyde
promptly
i
bought
it
when
i
was
touring
in
the
united
states
at
a
town
called
guthrie
in
oklahoma
and
he
added
suddenly
and
with
a
triumphant
smile
as
of
a
man
who
is
unexpectedly
able
to
clinch
an
argument
there
is
a
gentleman
there
who
was
with
me
when
i
bought
it
nugent
starr
from
the
magistrate
on
his
bench
to
the
policeman
at
the
door
every
person
in
court
turned
to
look
at
the
man
to
whom
the
prisoner
pointed
an
finger
and
pawle
let
out
an
irrepressible
exclamation
good
god
he
said
the
claimant
fellow
but
viner
said
nothing
he
was
staring
as
everybody
else
was
at
the
man
who
sat
by
methley
he
suddenly
aware
that
hyde
had
pointed
to
him
was
obviously
greatly
taken
aback
and
embarrassed
he
looked
sharply
at
the
prisoner
knitted
his
brows
shook
his
head
and
turning
to
methley
muttered
something
which
no
one
else
caught
looked
at
him
and
turned
to
his
client
you
say
there
is
a
gentleman
here
that
gentleman
who
was
with
you
when
you
bought
that
knife
he
asked
a
friend
of
yours
then
well
we
were
playing
in
the
same
company
asserted
hyde
company
he
was
heavy
lead
i
was
juvenile
he
knows
me
well
enough
he
was
with
me
when
i
bought
that
knife
in
a
hardware
store
in
guthrie
the
magistrate
eye
was
on
the
man
who
sat
by
methley
and
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
irritation
in
it
and
suddenly
methley
whispered
something
to
his
companion
and
the
man
shyly
but
with
a
noticeable
composure
stood
up
i
beg
your
worship
pardon
he
said
quietly
with
a
polite
bow
to
the
bench
but
really
the
witness
is
under
a
mistaken
impression
i
know
him
and
i
have
never
been
in
the
town
he
mentions
in
fact
i
have
never
been
in
the
united
states
i
am
very
sorry
but
really
there
is
some
strange
mistake
i
the
witness
is
an
absolute
stranger
to
me
the
attention
of
all
present
was
transferred
to
hyde
and
hyde
flushed
leaned
forward
over
the
ledge
of
the
and
gave
the
claimant
a
long
steady
stare
no
mistake
at
all
he
suddenly
exclaimed
in
a
firm
voice
that
nugent
starr
i
played
with
him
for
over
twelve
months
while
this
had
been
going
on
felpham
on
one
side
and
carless
on
the
other
had
been
whispering
to
who
listened
to
both
with
growing
interest
and
began
to
nod
to
each
with
increasing
intelligence
and
then
suddenly
the
prosecuting
counsel
played
unexpectedly
and
directly
into
his
hand
if
your
worship
pleases
said
the
prosecuting
counsel
i
should
like
to
have
the
prisoner
assertion
categorically
denied
it
may
be
of
importance
perhaps
this
gentleman
will
go
into
the
box
and
deny
it
on
oath
sat
down
as
quickly
as
if
a
heavy
hand
had
forced
him
into
his
seat
and
viner
saw
a
swift
look
of
gratification
cross
his
features
close
by
pawle
chuckled
with
joy
by
the
lord
harry
he
whispered
the
very
thing
we
wanted
no
need
to
wait
for
the
adjourned
coroner
inquest
viner
the
thing
come
out
now
viner
did
not
understand
he
saw
hyde
turned
out
of
the
box
he
saw
the
claimant
after
an
exchange
of
remarks
with
methley
step
into
it
he
heard
him
repeat
on
oath
the
denial
he
had
just
uttered
after
stating
that
his
name
was
cave
and
that
he
lived
at
the
belmead
hotel
lancaster
gate
and
he
saw
after
exchanging
a
few
questions
and
answers
in
whispers
with
hyde
over
the
ledge
of
the
dock
turn
to
the
witness
as
he
was
about
to
step
down
a
moment
sir
he
said
i
want
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
with
the
permission
of
his
worship
who
will
soon
see
that
they
are
very
pertinent
so
he
went
on
you
reside
at
the
belmead
hotel
in
lancaster
gate
and
your
name
is
edward
cave
at
present
answered
the
witness
stiffly
do
you
mean
that
your
name
is
edward
cave
at
present
my
name
is
edward
cave
and
at
present
i
live
as
i
have
stated
replied
the
witness
with
dignity
you
have
just
stated
on
oath
that
you
are
not
nugent
starr
have
never
been
so
called
do
know
the
prisoner
never
met
him
in
america
have
never
set
foot
in
america
now
then
mind
you
on
your
oath
is
edward
cave
your
real
or
full
name
well
strictly
speaking
answered
the
witness
after
some
hesitation
no
it
is
not
my
full
name
is
my
family
name
but
for
the
present
for
the
present
you
wish
to
be
called
cave
now
sir
are
you
not
the
person
who
claims
to
be
the
rightful
earl
of
ellingham
a
murmur
of
excited
interest
ran
round
the
court
and
everybody
recognized
that
a
new
stage
of
the
case
had
been
entered
upon
every
eye
especially
the
observant
eyes
on
the
bench
were
fixed
on
the
witness
who
now
looked
considerably
ruffled
he
glanced
at
methley
but
methley
sat
with
averted
look
and
made
no
sign
he
looked
at
the
magistrate
the
magistrate
it
was
plain
expected
the
question
to
be
answered
and
the
answer
came
almost
sullenly
yes
i
am
that
is
to
say
you
are
really
or
you
claim
to
be
really
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
from
england
some
years
ago
and
you
have
now
returned
though
you
are
legally
presumed
to
be
dead
to
assert
your
rights
to
titles
and
estates
you
absolutely
claim
to
be
the
ninth
earl
of
ellingham
yes
where
have
you
been
during
the
last
years
in
australia
what
part
chiefly
in
melbourne
but
i
was
for
four
or
five
years
what
name
did
you
go
under
there
pawle
carless
and
the
rest
of
the
spectators
who
were
in
these
secrets
regarded
the
witness
with
keen
attention
when
this
question
was
put
to
him
but
his
answer
came
promptly
at
first
under
the
name
of
wickham
later
under
the
one
i
now
use
cave
did
you
marry
out
there
never
and
so
of
course
you
never
had
a
daughter
i
have
never
been
married
and
have
never
had
daughter
or
son
turned
to
carless
at
his
left
elbow
and
exchanged
two
or
three
whispered
remarks
with
him
at
last
he
looked
round
again
at
the
witness
yesterday
he
said
in
your
character
of
claimant
to
the
ellingham
title
and
estates
you
showed
to
carless
driver
of
inn
fields
and
to
the
present
holder
of
the
title
certain
documents
letters
papers
which
would
go
some
way
toward
establishing
your
claim
to
be
what
you
profess
to
be
now
i
will
say
at
once
that
we
believe
these
papers
to
have
been
stolen
from
the
body
of
john
ashton
when
he
was
murdered
and
i
will
ask
you
a
direct
question
on
your
oath
have
those
papers
always
been
in
your
possession
since
you
left
england
years
ago
the
witness
drew
himself
up
and
looked
steadily
at
his
questioner
no
he
answered
firmly
they
were
stolen
from
me
almost
as
soon
as
i
arrived
in
australia
i
have
only
just
regained
possession
of
them
chapter
xxiii
is
this
man
right
a
murmur
of
astonishment
ran
through
the
court
as
the
witness
made
his
last
reply
and
those
most
closely
interested
in
him
turned
and
looked
at
each
other
with
obvious
amazement
and
for
a
moment
seemed
to
be
at
a
loss
in
the
next
he
bent
forward
toward
the
and
fixed
the
man
standing
there
with
a
piercing
look
do
you
seriously
tell
us
on
your
oath
that
these
papers
your
papers
if
you
are
what
you
claim
to
be
were
stolen
from
you
many
years
ago
and
have
only
just
been
restored
to
you
he
asked
on
your
oath
mind
i
do
tell
you
so
answered
the
witness
quietly
i
am
on
oath
the
magistrate
glanced
at
what
is
the
relevancy
of
this
in
relation
to
the
prisoner
and
the
charge
against
him
he
inquired
you
have
some
point
of
course
the
relevancy
is
this
your
worship
replied
our
contention
is
that
the
papers
referred
to
were
until
recently
in
the
custody
of
john
ashton
the
murdered
man
i
can
put
a
witness
in
the
box
who
can
give
absolute
proof
of
that
a
highly
reputable
witness
who
is
present
and
that
john
ashton
was
certainly
murdered
by
some
person
or
persons
who
for
purposes
of
their
own
wished
to
gain
possession
of
them
now
we
know
that
they
are
in
possession
of
the
present
witness
or
rather
of
his
solicitors
to
whom
he
has
handed
them
i
mean
to
prove
that
ashton
was
murdered
in
the
way
and
for
the
reason
i
suggest
and
that
accordingly
the
prisoner
is
absolutely
innocent
of
the
charge
brought
against
him
i
should
therefore
like
to
ask
this
witness
to
tell
us
how
he
regained
possession
of
these
papers
for
i
am
convinced
that
in
what
he
can
tell
us
lies
the
secret
of
ashton
murder
now
he
continued
turning
again
to
the
witness
as
the
magistrate
nodded
assent
we
will
assume
for
the
time
being
that
you
are
what
you
represent
yourself
to
be
the
lord
marketstoke
who
disappeared
from
england
years
ago
you
have
just
heard
what
i
said
to
his
worship
about
these
papers
and
what
i
put
forward
as
regards
their
connection
with
the
murder
of
john
ashton
will
you
tell
us
how
you
lost
those
papers
and
more
particularly
how
you
recently
regained
possession
of
them
you
see
the
immense
the
vital
importance
of
this
to
the
unfortunate
young
fellow
in
the
dock
who
answered
the
witness
with
a
calm
smile
is
quite
and
utterly
mistaken
in
thinking
that
he
knew
me
in
america
for
i
have
certainly
never
set
foot
in
america
neither
north
nor
south
in
my
life
i
am
very
much
surprised
indeed
to
be
forced
into
publicity
as
i
have
been
this
morning
i
came
here
as
a
merely
curious
spectator
and
had
no
idea
whatever
that
i
should
be
called
into
this
box
but
if
any
evidence
of
mine
can
establish
or
help
to
establish
the
prisoner
innocence
i
will
give
it
only
too
gladly
much
obliged
to
you
sir
said
who
in
opinion
was
evidently
impressed
by
the
witness
straightforward
tone
and
candid
demeanour
well
if
you
will
tell
us
in
your
own
way
about
these
papers
now
always
remembering
that
we
have
absolute
proof
that
until
recently
they
were
in
the
possession
of
john
ashton
let
me
preface
whatever
you
choose
to
tell
us
with
a
question
do
you
know
that
they
were
in
possession
of
john
ashton
i
have
no
more
idea
or
knowledge
of
whose
hands
they
were
in
and
had
been
in
for
many
years
until
they
were
restored
to
me
than
the
man
in
the
moon
has
affirmed
the
witness
i
tell
you
the
whole
story
willingly
i
could
have
told
it
yesterday
to
certain
gentlemen
whom
i
see
present
if
they
had
not
treated
me
as
an
impostor
as
soon
as
they
saw
me
well
here
he
folded
his
hands
on
the
ledge
of
the
and
quietly
fixing
his
eyes
on
the
examining
counsel
proceeded
to
speak
in
a
calm
conversational
tone
the
story
is
this
i
left
england
about
years
ago
after
certain
domestic
unpleasantnesses
which
i
felt
so
much
that
i
determined
to
give
up
all
connection
with
my
family
and
to
start
an
absolutely
new
life
of
my
own
i
went
away
to
australia
and
landed
there
under
the
name
of
wickham
i
had
a
certain
amount
of
money
which
had
come
to
me
from
my
mother
i
speculated
with
it
on
my
arrival
somewhat
foolishly
no
doubt
and
i
lost
it
every
penny
so
then
i
was
obliged
to
work
for
my
living
i
went
up
country
and
for
some
time
worked
as
a
miner
in
the
bendigo
district
i
had
been
working
in
this
way
perhaps
fourteen
months
when
an
accident
occurred
in
the
mine
at
which
i
was
engaged
there
was
a
serious
fall
of
earth
and
masonry
two
or
three
of
my
were
killed
on
the
spot
and
i
was
taken
up
for
dead
i
was
removed
to
a
local
hospital
there
had
been
some
serious
injury
to
my
head
and
spine
but
i
still
had
life
in
me
and
i
was
brought
round
but
i
remained
in
hospital
in
a
sort
of
semiconscious
state
for
a
long
time
months
when
i
went
back
after
my
discharge
to
my
quarters
nothing
but
a
rough
shanty
which
i
had
shared
with
many
other
men
all
my
possessions
had
vanished
among
them
of
course
were
the
papers
i
had
kept
and
a
packet
of
letters
written
to
me
by
my
mother
when
i
was
a
schoolboy
at
eton
of
course
i
knew
at
once
what
had
happened
some
one
of
my
mates
believing
me
to
be
dead
had
appropriated
all
my
belongings
and
gone
off
with
them
there
was
nothing
at
all
to
be
wondered
at
in
that
it
was
the
usual
thing
in
such
a
society
and
i
knew
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
accept
my
loss
philosophically
did
you
make
no
effort
to
recover
your
possessions
asked
no
answered
the
witness
with
a
quiet
smile
i
did
i
knew
too
much
of
the
habits
of
men
in
mining
centers
to
waste
time
in
that
way
a
great
many
men
had
left
that
particular
camp
during
my
illness
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
trace
each
one
no
after
all
i
had
left
england
in
order
to
lose
my
identity
and
now
of
course
it
was
gone
i
went
away
into
quite
another
part
of
the
country
into
queensland
i
began
trading
in
brisbane
and
i
did
very
well
there
and
remained
there
many
years
then
i
went
farther
south
to
sydney
and
i
did
very
well
there
too
it
was
in
sydney
years
after
that
that
i
saw
the
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
english
and
colonial
setting
forth
that
my
father
was
dead
and
asking
for
news
of
myself
i
took
no
notice
of
them
i
had
not
the
least
desire
to
return
to
england
no
wish
for
the
title
and
i
was
quite
content
that
my
youngest
brother
should
get
that
and
the
estates
so
i
did
nothing
nobody
knew
who
i
really
was
one
moment
said
while
you
were
at
the
in
the
bendigo
district
did
you
ever
reveal
your
secret
to
any
of
your
never
answered
the
witness
i
never
revealed
it
to
a
living
soul
until
i
told
my
solicitor
there
methley
after
my
recent
arrival
in
london
but
of
course
whoever
stole
your
letters
and
so
on
would
discover
or
guess
at
the
truth
suggested
oh
of
course
of
course
said
the
witness
well
as
i
was
saying
i
did
nothing
except
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
papers
i
saw
in
due
course
that
leave
to
presume
my
death
had
been
given
and
that
my
younger
brother
had
assumed
the
title
and
administered
the
estate
and
i
was
quite
content
the
fact
was
i
was
at
that
time
doing
exceedingly
well
and
i
was
too
much
interested
in
my
doings
to
care
about
what
was
going
on
in
england
all
my
life
continued
the
witness
with
a
slight
smile
i
have
had
a
i
had
better
call
it
a
weakness
for
speculating
and
when
i
had
got
a
goodly
sum
of
money
together
by
my
trading
venture
in
brisbane
and
sydney
i
began
speculating
again
in
melbourne
chiefly
and
to
cut
my
story
short
last
year
i
had
one
of
my
periodic
bad
turns
of
fortune
i
lost
a
lot
of
money
now
i
am
as
you
see
getting
on
in
life
over
sixty
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
if
i
came
over
to
england
and
convinced
my
nephew
the
present
holder
of
the
title
and
estates
that
i
am
really
who
i
am
he
would
not
be
averse
we
have
always
been
a
generous
family
to
giving
me
enough
to
settle
down
on
in
australia
for
the
rest
of
my
days
perhaps
i
had
better
say
at
once
since
we
are
making
matters
so
very
public
that
i
do
not
want
the
title
nor
the
estate
i
will
be
quite
candid
and
say
what
i
do
want
enough
to
let
me
live
in
proper
comfort
in
australia
whither
i
shall
again
repair
as
soon
as
i
settle
my
affairs
here
glanced
at
the
magistrate
and
then
at
the
witness
well
now
these
papers
he
said
you
did
bring
them
to
london
with
you
of
course
not
answered
the
witness
i
had
not
seen
or
heard
of
them
for
years
no
i
relied
on
coming
to
this
country
on
other
things
to
prove
my
identity
such
as
my
knowledge
of
marketstoke
and
ellingham
my
thorough
acquaintance
with
the
family
history
my
recollection
of
people
i
had
known
like
carless
driver
and
their
clerk
portlethwaite
and
on
the
fact
that
i
lost
this
finger
through
a
shooting
accident
when
i
was
a
boy
at
ellingham
curiously
he
added
with
another
smile
these
things
do
seem
to
have
much
weight
but
no
i
had
no
papers
when
i
landed
here
how
did
they
come
into
your
possession
then
asked
that
is
what
we
most
earnestly
desire
to
know
let
me
impress
upon
you
sir
that
this
is
the
most
serious
and
fateful
question
i
can
possibly
put
to
you
how
did
you
get
them
and
from
whom
said
the
magistrate
from
whom
the
witness
shook
his
head
i
can
tell
you
exactly
how
i
got
them
he
answered
but
i
ca
tell
you
from
whom
for
i
do
know
what
i
can
tell
you
is
this
when
i
arrived
at
tilbury
from
melbourne
i
asked
a
with
whom
i
came
along
to
london
if
he
could
tell
me
of
a
quiet
good
hotel
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
parks
he
recommended
the
belfield
in
lancaster
gate
i
went
there
and
put
myself
up
and
from
it
i
went
out
and
about
a
good
deal
looking
up
old
haunts
i
also
lunched
and
dined
a
good
many
times
at
some
of
the
new
restaurants
which
had
sprung
into
being
since
i
left
london
i
mention
this
to
show
you
that
i
was
where
i
could
be
seen
and
noticed
as
i
evidently
was
one
afternoon
while
i
was
sitting
in
the
at
my
hotel
the
came
in
with
a
letter
on
his
tray
approached
me
and
said
that
it
had
been
brought
by
a
district
messenger
it
was
addressed
simply
cave
the
name
by
which
i
had
registered
at
the
hotel
and
was
sealed
the
inclosure
on
a
of
was
typewritten
i
have
it
here
continued
the
witness
producing
a
pocketbook
and
taking
out
an
envelope
i
will
read
its
contents
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
let
any
one
concerned
see
it
there
is
no
address
and
no
date
and
it
says
this
you
wish
to
recover
the
papers
and
letters
which
were
lost
by
you
when
you
went
into
hospital
at
bendigo
years
ago
be
at
the
speke
monument
in
kensington
gardens
at
five
this
afternoon
there
was
no
signature
another
murmur
of
intense
and
excited
interest
ran
round
the
court
as
the
witness
handed
the
letter
up
to
the
magistrate
who
after
looking
it
over
passed
it
on
to
the
counsel
below
they
in
their
turn
showed
it
to
carless
pawle
and
lord
ellingham
pawle
showing
it
to
viner
whispered
in
his
ear
if
this
man
telling
the
truth
he
said
this
is
the
most
extraordinary
story
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
the
truth
muttered
viner
and
i
pretty
certain
that
at
last
we
on
the
finding
out
who
killed
ashton
but
let
hear
the
end
handed
the
letter
back
with
a
polite
bow
it
was
very
obvious
to
more
than
one
observer
that
he
had
by
this
time
quite
accepted
the
witness
as
what
he
claimed
to
be
you
kept
the
appointment
he
asked
i
did
indeed
exclaimed
the
witness
as
much
out
of
greatly
excited
curiosity
as
anything
it
seemed
to
me
a
most
extraordinary
thing
that
papers
stolen
from
me
in
australia
years
ago
should
be
returned
to
me
in
london
yes
i
walked
down
to
the
speke
monument
i
saw
no
one
about
there
but
a
heavily
veiled
woman
who
walked
about
on
one
side
of
the
obelisk
while
i
patrolled
the
other
eventually
she
approached
me
and
at
once
asked
me
if
i
had
kept
secret
the
receipt
of
the
mysterious
letter
i
assured
her
that
i
had
she
then
told
me
that
she
was
the
ambassadress
of
the
people
who
had
my
letters
and
papers
and
who
had
seen
and
recognized
me
in
london
and
tracked
me
to
my
hotel
she
was
empowered
to
negotiate
with
me
for
the
handing
over
of
the
papers
there
were
stipulations
i
was
to
give
my
solemn
word
of
honour
that
i
would
not
follow
her
or
cause
her
to
be
followed
i
was
not
to
ask
questions
and
i
was
to
give
a
check
on
the
bank
at
which
i
had
opened
an
account
in
london
on
receipt
of
the
papers
the
check
was
to
be
one
month
it
was
to
be
made
out
to
bearer
and
the
amount
was
ten
thousand
pounds
i
agreed
you
really
agreed
exclaimed
i
agreed
i
wanted
my
papers
we
parted
with
an
agreement
that
we
were
to
meet
two
days
later
at
the
same
place
i
was
there
so
was
the
woman
she
handed
me
a
parcel
and
i
immediately
took
it
to
an
adjacent
seat
and
examined
it
everything
that
i
could
remember
was
there
with
two
exceptions
the
packet
of
letters
from
my
mother
to
which
i
referred
just
now
was
missing
so
was
a
certain
locket
which
had
belonged
to
her
and
of
which
i
had
taken
great
care
since
her
death
up
to
the
time
of
my
accident
in
the
i
pointed
out
these
omissions
to
the
woman
she
answered
that
the
papers
which
she
had
handed
over
were
all
that
had
been
in
her
principal
possession
thereupon
i
gave
her
the
check
which
had
been
agreed
upon
and
we
parted
and
that
is
all
you
know
of
her
asked
all
can
you
describe
her
a
tallish
rather
woman
but
so
veiled
that
i
could
see
nothing
of
her
features
it
was
moreover
nearly
dark
on
both
occasions
from
her
speech
and
manner
she
was
i
should
say
a
woman
of
education
and
refinement
did
you
try
to
trace
her
or
her
principals
through
the
district
messenger
who
brought
the
letter
certainly
not
i
told
you
just
now
that
i
gave
my
word
of
honour
i
could
turned
to
the
magistrate
i
can
if
your
worship
desires
it
put
a
witness
in
the
box
who
can
prove
beyond
doubt
that
the
papers
of
which
we
have
just
heard
this
remarkable
story
were
recently
in
the
possession
of
john
ashton
he
said
he
is
cecil
perkwite
of
the
middle
temple
a
member
of
my
own
profession
but
the
magistrate
who
appeared
unusually
thoughtful
shook
his
head
after
what
we
have
heard
he
said
i
think
we
had
better
adjourn
the
prisoner
will
be
remanded
as
before
for
another
week
when
the
magistrate
had
left
the
bench
and
the
court
was
humming
with
the
murmur
of
tongues
suddenly
let
free
pawle
forced
his
way
to
the
side
of
the
last
witness
whoever
you
are
sir
he
said
there
one
thing
certain
nobody
but
you
can
supply
the
solution
of
the
mystery
about
ashton
death
come
with
me
and
carless
at
once
chapter
xxiv
the
broken
letter
the
man
whose
extraordinary
story
had
excited
such
intense
interest
had
become
the
object
of
universal
attention
hyde
hitherto
the
centre
of
attraction
was
already
forgotten
and
instead
of
people
going
away
from
the
court
to
canvass
his
guilt
or
his
innocence
they
surged
round
the
witness
whose
testimony
strange
and
unexpected
had
so
altered
the
probabilities
of
the
case
it
was
with
difficulty
that
methley
got
his
client
away
into
a
private
room
there
they
were
joined
by
carless
pawle
perkwite
lord
ellingham
and
viner
and
behind
a
locked
door
these
men
looked
at
each
other
and
at
this
centre
of
interest
with
the
air
of
those
to
whom
something
extraordinary
has
just
been
told
after
a
moment
of
silence
carless
spoke
addressing
the
man
whose
story
had
brought
matters
to
an
undeniable
crisis
i
am
sure
he
said
gravely
and
with
a
side
glance
at
lord
ellingham
that
if
your
story
is
true
sir
and
after
what
we
have
just
heard
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
my
first
conclusions
may
have
been
wrong
ones
no
one
will
welcome
your
reappearance
more
warmly
than
the
young
gentleman
whom
you
will
turn
out
of
title
and
property
but
you
must
see
for
yourself
that
your
claims
must
be
thoroughly
investigated
and
as
what
you
have
now
just
told
affects
other
people
and
we
must
invite
you
to
full
discussion
i
propose
that
for
the
time
being
we
address
you
as
mr
cave
the
claimant
smiled
and
nodded
genially
to
the
young
man
whose
uncle
he
alleged
himself
to
be
i
wish
to
remain
cave
he
said
i
do
want
to
turn
my
nephew
out
of
title
and
property
so
long
as
he
will
do
something
for
his
old
uncle
call
me
cave
by
all
means
we
must
talk
and
at
once
said
carless
there
are
several
points
arising
out
of
your
evidence
on
which
you
must
give
me
information
whoever
is
at
the
back
of
that
woman
who
handed
you
those
papers
is
probably
the
murderer
of
john
ashton
and
that
is
what
must
be
got
at
now
where
can
we
have
a
conference
immediately
your
office
methley
is
not
far
away
i
think
my
house
is
nearer
said
viner
come
we
shall
be
perfectly
quiet
in
my
study
and
there
will
be
nothing
to
interrupt
us
let
us
go
now
a
police
official
let
them
out
by
a
and
viner
and
pawle
led
the
way
through
some
to
markendale
square
the
others
coming
behind
conversing
eagerly
about
the
events
of
the
morning
pawle
on
his
part
was
full
of
excitement
if
we
can
only
trace
that
woman
viner
he
exclaimed
that
the
next
thing
get
hold
of
her
whoever
she
is
and
then
ah
we
shall
be
in
sight
of
the
what
about
tracing
the
whole
lot
through
the
check
he
has
given
suggested
viner
would
that
be
a
good
way
we
should
have
to
wait
nearly
a
month
answered
pawle
and
even
then
it
would
be
difficult
simple
though
it
seems
at
first
sight
there
are
folk
who
deal
in
checks
remember
this
may
have
been
dealt
with
already
aye
and
that
diamond
too
and
the
man
who
has
got
the
proceeds
may
already
be
many
a
mile
away
deep
cunning
folk
they
are
who
have
been
in
this
viner
and
now
speed
is
the
thing
viner
led
his
guests
into
his
library
and
as
he
placed
chairs
for
them
round
a
centre
table
an
idea
struck
him
i
have
a
suggestion
to
make
he
said
with
a
shy
smile
at
the
legal
men
my
aunt
miss
penkridge
who
lives
with
me
is
an
unusually
sharp
shrewd
woman
she
has
taken
vast
interest
in
this
affair
and
i
have
kept
her
posted
up
in
all
its
details
she
was
in
court
just
now
and
heard
cave
story
if
no
one
has
any
objection
i
should
like
her
to
be
present
at
our
deliberations
as
a
mysterious
woman
has
entered
into
the
case
miss
penkridge
may
be
able
to
suggest
something
excellent
idea
exclaimed
carless
a
shrewd
woman
is
worth
her
weight
in
gold
by
all
means
bring
miss
penkridge
in
she
may
as
you
say
make
some
suggestion
miss
penkridge
fetched
into
the
room
and
duly
introduced
lost
no
time
in
making
a
suggestion
of
an
eminently
practical
nature
that
as
all
these
gentlemen
had
been
cooped
up
in
that
stuffy
for
two
or
three
hours
they
would
be
none
the
worse
for
a
glass
of
wine
and
she
immediately
disappeared
jingling
a
bunch
of
keys
to
reappear
a
few
minutes
later
in
charge
of
the
carrying
decanters
and
glasses
a
very
comfortable
suggestion
that
observed
carless
bowing
to
his
hostess
over
a
glass
of
old
sherry
your
intuition
does
you
credit
but
now
gentlemen
and
miss
penkridge
straight
to
business
cave
the
first
question
i
want
to
put
to
you
is
this
on
what
date
did
you
receive
the
letter
which
you
exhibited
in
court
this
morning
cave
produced
a
small
pocket
diary
and
turned
over
its
pages
i
can
tell
you
that
he
answered
i
made
a
note
of
it
at
the
time
it
was
yes
here
we
are
on
the
of
november
and
you
received
these
papers
i
think
you
said
two
days
later
yes
on
the
here
is
the
entry
carless
looked
round
at
the
assembled
faces
john
ashton
was
murdered
on
the
night
of
the
of
november
he
remarked
significantly
therefore
he
had
not
been
murdered
when
the
veiled
woman
first
met
cave
for
the
first
time
and
he
had
been
murdered
when
she
met
cave
the
second
time
there
was
a
silence
as
significant
as
carless
tone
upon
this
broken
at
last
by
cave
if
i
may
say
a
word
or
two
he
remarked
diffidently
i
understand
matters
about
this
john
ashton
the
barrister
who
asked
me
questions
is
it
said
that
he
or
somebody
had
positive
proof
that
ashton
had
my
papers
in
his
possession
for
some
time
previous
to
his
death
is
that
really
so
carless
pointed
to
perkwite
this
is
the
gentleman
whom
could
have
put
in
the
box
this
morning
to
prove
that
he
replied
perkwite
of
the
middle
temple
a
cave
perkwite
met
ashton
some
three
months
ago
at
marseilles
and
ashton
then
not
only
asked
his
advice
about
the
ellingham
affair
alleging
that
he
knew
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
but
showed
him
the
papers
which
you
have
recently
deposited
with
methley
here
which
papers
ashton
alleged
were
intrusted
to
him
by
lord
marketstoke
on
his
deathbed
ashton
according
to
perkwite
took
particular
care
of
these
papers
and
always
carried
them
about
with
him
in
a
pocketbook
cave
appeared
to
be
much
exercised
in
thought
on
hearing
this
it
is
of
course
absurd
to
say
that
lord
marketstoke
myself
intrusted
papers
to
any
one
on
his
deathbed
since
i
am
very
much
alive
he
said
but
it
is
equally
of
course
quite
possible
that
ashton
had
my
papers
who
was
ashton
a
man
who
had
lived
in
australia
for
some
or
forty
years
at
least
replied
carless
and
who
recently
returned
to
england
and
settled
down
in
london
in
this
very
square
he
lived
chiefly
in
melbourne
but
we
have
heard
that
for
some
four
or
five
years
he
was
somewhere
up
country
you
never
heard
of
him
out
there
he
was
evidently
well
known
in
melbourne
no
i
never
heard
of
him
replied
cave
but
i
do
know
melbourne
very
well
i
know
sydney
and
brisbane
better
however
an
idea
strikes
me
ashton
may
have
had
something
to
do
with
the
purloining
of
my
letters
and
effects
at
when
i
met
with
the
accident
i
told
you
of
so
far
as
we
are
aware
remarked
carless
ashton
was
an
eminently
respectable
man
so
far
as
you
know
said
cave
there
is
a
good
deal
in
the
saving
clause
i
think
i
have
known
a
good
many
men
in
australia
who
were
highly
respectable
in
the
last
stages
of
life
who
had
been
anything
but
that
in
their
earlier
ones
of
what
class
was
this
ashton
i
met
him
occasionally
said
methley
though
i
never
knew
who
he
was
until
after
his
death
he
was
a
very
pleasant
kindly
man
but
he
added
i
should
say
from
his
speech
and
manners
a
man
who
had
risen
from
a
somewhat
humble
position
of
life
i
remember
noticing
his
hands
they
were
the
hands
of
a
man
who
at
some
period
had
done
hard
manual
labour
cave
smiled
knowingly
there
you
are
he
said
he
had
probably
been
a
miner
taking
everything
into
consideration
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
he
was
most
likely
one
of
the
men
or
the
man
who
stole
my
papers
years
ago
there
may
be
something
in
this
remarked
pawle
glancing
uneasily
at
carless
it
is
a
fact
that
the
packet
of
letters
to
which
cave
referred
this
morning
as
having
been
written
by
the
countess
of
ellingham
to
lord
marketstoke
when
a
boy
at
school
was
found
by
viner
and
myself
in
ashton
house
and
that
the
locket
which
he
also
mentioned
is
in
existence
facts
which
cave
will
doubtless
be
glad
to
know
of
but
added
the
old
lawyer
shaking
his
head
what
does
all
this
imply
that
ashton
of
whom
up
to
now
we
have
heard
nothing
but
good
was
not
only
a
thief
but
an
impostor
who
was
endeavouring
or
meant
to
endeavour
to
palm
off
a
bogus
claimant
on
people
who
but
for
cave
appearance
and
evidence
would
certainly
have
been
deceived
it
is
most
amazing
do
forget
said
viner
quietly
that
perkwite
says
that
ashton
showed
him
at
marseilles
a
certain
marriage
certificate
and
a
birth
certificate
carless
started
ah
he
exclaimed
i
had
forgotten
that
um
however
do
let
us
forget
just
now
that
our
main
object
in
meeting
was
to
do
something
towards
tracking
these
people
who
gave
cave
these
papers
now
cave
you
got
no
information
out
of
the
woman
none
answered
cave
i
was
not
to
ask
questions
you
remember
you
took
her
for
a
gentlewoman
yes
from
her
speech
and
manner
did
she
imply
to
you
that
she
was
an
intermediary
yes
she
spoke
of
some
one
indefinitely
you
know
for
whom
she
was
acting
and
she
told
you
i
think
that
you
had
been
recognized
in
london
since
your
arrival
by
some
one
who
had
known
you
in
australia
years
before
yes
certainly
she
told
me
that
just
let
me
look
at
that
typewritten
letter
again
will
you
asked
carless
it
seems
impossible
but
we
might
get
something
out
of
that
cave
handed
the
letter
over
and
once
more
it
was
passed
from
hand
to
hand
finally
it
fell
into
the
hands
of
miss
penkridge
who
began
to
examine
it
with
obvious
curiosity
afraid
there
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
that
sighed
carless
the
rogues
were
cunning
enough
to
typewrite
the
message
if
there
been
any
handwriting
now
we
might
have
had
a
chance
you
say
there
was
nothing
on
the
envelope
but
your
name
mr
cave
cave
opened
his
pocketbook
again
there
is
the
envelope
he
said
nothing
but
as
you
see
that
is
also
typewritten
miss
penkridge
picked
up
the
envelope
as
cave
tossed
it
across
the
table
she
appeared
to
examine
it
carefully
but
suddenly
she
turned
to
carless
there
a
clue
in
these
things
she
exclaimed
a
plain
clue
one
that
plain
enough
to
me
anyway
i
could
follow
it
up
i
do
know
whether
you
gentlemen
can
carless
who
had
up
to
that
point
treated
miss
penkridge
with
condescension
turned
sharply
upon
her
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
you
really
see
something
in
in
a
typewritten
letter
a
great
deal
answered
miss
penkridge
and
in
the
stationery
on
which
it
typed
and
in
the
envelope
in
which
it
inclosed
now
look
here
this
letter
has
been
typed
on
a
of
notepaper
hold
the
up
to
the
light
what
do
you
see
one
half
of
the
name
and
address
of
the
stationer
who
supplied
it
in
watermark
what
is
that
one
half
carless
held
the
paper
to
the
light
and
saw
on
the
top
line
on
the
middle
line
and
on
the
bottom
line
my
nephew
there
went
on
miss
penkridge
knows
what
that
would
be
in
full
if
the
other
half
of
the
sheet
were
here
it
would
be
precisely
what
it
is
under
the
flap
of
this
envelope
there
you
are
bookseller
and
stationer
craven
hill
everybody
in
this
district
knows
bigglesforth
we
get
our
stationery
from
him
now
bigglesforth
has
not
such
a
very
big
business
in
really
expensive
notepaper
like
this
the
other
half
of
the
sheet
of
course
would
have
a
finely
engraved
address
on
it
and
you
can
trace
the
owner
of
this
paper
through
him
with
patience
and
trouble
but
here
a
still
better
clue
look
at
this
typewritten
letter
in
it
the
letter
occurs
with
frequency
now
notice
the
letter
is
broken
imperfect
the
top
curve
has
been
chipped
off
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
with
time
and
trouble
and
patience
you
find
out
to
whom
that
machine
belongs
taking
the
fact
that
this
of
notepaper
came
from
bigglesforth
of
craven
hill
concluded
miss
penkridge
with
emphasis
i
should
say
that
this
document
so
important
came
from
somebody
who
does
live
a
million
miles
from
here
carless
had
followed
miss
penkridge
with
admiring
attention
and
he
now
rose
to
his
feet
he
exclaimed
viner
notion
of
having
you
to
join
our
council
has
proved
invaluable
i
have
that
clue
followed
up
instantly
gentlemen
we
can
do
no
more
just
now
let
us
separate
cave
continue
to
be
heard
of
at
the
belfield
hotel
i
shall
be
at
your
service
any
time
carless
responded
cave
a
telephone
message
will
bring
me
at
once
to
lincoln
inn
fields
the
assembly
broke
up
and
viner
was
left
alone
with
miss
penkridge
that
was
clever
of
you
he
said
admiringly
i
should
never
have
noticed
that
but
there
are
a
lot
of
typewriting
machines
in
london
not
so
many
owned
by
customers
of
bigglesforth
retorted
miss
penkridge
i
work
it
out
if
i
were
a
detective
the
looked
in
and
attracted
viner
attention
felpham
wants
you
at
the
telephone
sir
she
said
chapter
xxv
through
the
telephone
events
had
crowded
so
thick
and
fast
upon
viner
during
the
last
day
or
two
that
he
went
to
the
telephone
fully
expecting
to
hear
of
some
new
development
but
he
was
scarcely
prepared
for
his
first
words
viner
said
felpham
whose
voice
betrayed
his
excitement
is
that
man
cave
still
with
you
no
answered
viner
why
listen
carefully
responded
felpham
in
spite
of
all
he
asserts
and
his
long
tale
this
morning
at
the
i
believe
he
a
rank
impostor
i
just
had
another
talk
with
hyde
well
demanded
viner
hyde
answered
felpham
persists
that
he
not
mistaken
he
swears
that
the
man
is
nugent
starr
he
says
there
no
doubt
of
it
and
told
me
of
another
actor
a
man
named
george
bellingham
who
now
somewhere
in
london
who
can
positively
identify
him
as
starr
i
going
to
find
bellingham
this
afternoon
there
some
plot
in
all
this
and
that
fellow
had
been
cleverly
coached
in
the
event
of
his
being
unexpectedly
tackled
viner
well
i
listening
carefully
replied
viner
where
this
man
gone
demanded
felpham
to
his
hotel
i
should
think
answered
viner
he
left
here
just
before
one
listen
said
felpham
do
you
think
it
would
be
wise
to
post
new
scotland
yard
on
to
him
detectives
you
know
viner
considered
swiftly
in
the
rush
of
events
he
had
forgotten
that
carless
had
already
given
instructions
for
the
watching
of
the
pseudo
cave
why
not
find
this
man
bellingham
first
he
suggested
if
he
can
prove
positively
that
the
fellow
is
nugent
starr
you
have
something
definite
to
work
on
where
can
bellingham
be
found
hyde
given
me
the
address
of
a
theatrical
agent
in
bedford
street
who
likely
to
know
of
his
whereabouts
replied
felpham
i
going
over
there
at
once
hyde
saw
bellingham
in
town
three
weeks
ago
let
me
know
at
once
said
viner
if
you
find
bellingham
take
him
to
the
belfield
hotel
and
contrive
to
show
him
the
man
call
me
up
later
he
went
away
from
his
telephone
and
sought
miss
penkridge
whom
he
found
in
her
room
arraying
herself
for
out
of
doors
here
a
new
development
he
exclaimed
shutting
the
door
on
them
felpham
just
telephoned
to
say
that
hyde
persists
that
the
man
who
calls
himself
cave
is
nugent
starr
in
that
case
he
wo
miss
penkridge
interrupted
her
nephew
with
a
sniff
my
dear
richard
she
said
with
a
note
of
contemptuous
impatience
in
a
case
like
this
you
do
know
who
who
or
who
is
who
it
surprise
me
in
the
slightest
if
the
man
turns
out
to
be
nugent
starr
how
did
he
come
by
such
a
straight
tale
then
asked
viner
doubtfully
carefully
prepared
in
case
of
need
declared
miss
penkridge
as
she
tied
her
with
a
decisive
tug
the
whole
thing
a
plant
that
what
felpham
says
remarked
viner
but
where
are
you
going
he
broke
off
as
miss
penkridge
seizing
an
umbrella
started
for
the
door
lunch
is
just
going
in
my
lunch
can
wait
i
had
a
biscuit
and
a
glass
of
sherry
asserted
miss
penkridge
i
going
round
to
bigglesforth
the
stationer
to
follow
up
that
clue
i
suggested
just
now
i
dare
say
i
can
do
a
bit
of
detective
work
as
well
as
another
and
in
my
opinion
richard
there
no
time
to
be
lost
i
have
been
blessed
and
endowed
continued
miss
penkridge
as
she
laid
hold
of
the
with
exceedingly
acute
perceptions
and
i
saw
something
when
i
made
that
suggestion
which
quite
sure
none
of
you
men
with
all
your
brains
saw
what
demanded
viner
i
saw
that
my
suggestion
was
at
all
pleasing
to
the
man
who
calls
himself
cave
exclaimed
miss
penkridge
it
was
only
a
flash
of
his
eye
a
sudden
droop
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
but
i
saw
and
i
saw
something
else
too
that
he
got
away
as
quickly
as
ever
he
could
after
i
made
that
suggestion
viner
looked
at
his
aunt
with
amused
wonder
he
thought
she
was
unduly
suspicious
and
miss
penkridge
guessed
his
thoughts
you
see
she
said
as
she
opened
the
door
there
are
going
to
be
strange
revelations
richard
viner
my
boy
you
said
at
the
beginning
of
this
that
you
suddenly
got
plunged
into
the
middle
of
things
well
in
my
opinion
we
now
coming
to
the
end
of
things
and
i
going
to
do
my
bit
to
bring
it
about
with
that
miss
penkridge
sailed
away
her
step
determined
and
her
head
high
and
viner
pondering
many
matters
went
downstairs
to
entertain
his
visitors
the
unlucky
hyde
sisters
with
stories
of
the
proceedings
and
hopes
of
their
brother
speedy
acquittal
the
poor
ladies
were
of
that
temperament
which
makes
its
possessors
clutch
eagerly
at
any
straw
of
hope
floating
on
the
sea
of
trouble
and
they
listened
eagerly
to
all
that
their
host
could
tell
langton
has
an
excellent
memory
declared
the
elder
miss
hyde
you
remember
sister
what
a
quantity
of
poetical
pieces
he
knew
by
heart
when
he
was
quite
a
child
before
he
was
seven
years
of
age
said
the
younger
sister
and
at
ten
he
could
recite
the
whole
of
the
trial
scene
from
merchant
of
venice
oh
yes
he
always
had
a
marvellous
memory
if
langton
says
he
remembers
this
man
in
america
dear
viner
i
am
sure
langton
will
be
right
and
that
this
is
the
man
but
what
a
very
dreadful
person
to
utter
such
terrible
falsehoods
and
on
oath
said
the
elder
miss
hyde
solemnly
on
oath
sister
sad
murmured
the
younger
lady
most
sad
we
find
london
life
very
disturbing
dear
viner
after
our
quiet
country
existence
there
are
certainly
some
disturbing
elements
in
it
admitted
viner
just
then
came
another
interruption
for
the
second
time
since
his
return
from
the
he
was
summoned
to
the
telephone
to
his
great
surprise
the
voice
that
hailed
him
was
killenhall
is
that
mr
viner
the
voice
demanded
in
its
usual
brisk
clear
tones
yes
answered
viner
is
that
mrs
killenhall
yes
came
the
prompt
reply
viner
can
you
be
so
very
kind
miss
wickham
and
i
have
come
down
to
the
city
on
some
business
connected
with
ashton
and
we
do
so
want
somebody
help
can
you
run
down
at
once
and
join
us
so
sorry
to
trouble
you
but
we
really
do
want
a
gentleman
here
certainly
responded
viner
i
come
to
you
at
once
but
where
are
you
come
to
mirrapore
street
off
whitechapel
road
answered
killenhall
there
is
some
one
here
who
knew
ashton
and
i
should
like
you
to
see
him
can
you
come
at
once
and
have
you
the
address
right
a
moment
repeat
it
please
replied
viner
pulling
out
a
memorandum
book
he
noted
the
address
and
spoke
again
i
be
there
in
half
an
hour
killenhall
he
said
sooner
if
it
possible
thank
you
so
much
responded
killenhall
steady
voice
so
good
of
you
for
the
present
then
said
viner
he
hurried
away
into
the
hall
snatched
up
a
hat
and
letting
himself
out
of
the
house
ran
to
the
nearest
and
beckoned
to
a
chauffeur
who
often
took
him
about
i
want
to
get
along
to
mirrapore
street
whitechapel
road
he
said
as
he
sprang
into
the
car
do
you
know
whereabouts
it
is
the
chauffeur
knitted
his
brows
and
shook
his
head
there
a
sight
of
small
streets
running
off
whitechapel
road
both
sides
sir
he
answered
it
be
one
of
them
i
find
it
mirrapore
street
right
sir
get
there
as
quickly
as
possible
said
viner
the
quicker
the
better
it
was
not
until
he
had
gone
a
good
half
of
his
journey
that
viner
began
to
wonder
whatever
it
was
that
had
taken
miss
wickham
and
her
chaperon
down
to
the
far
boundaries
of
the
city
or
indeed
farther
killenhall
had
said
the
city
but
viner
knew
his
london
well
enough
to
know
that
whitechapel
road
lies
without
the
city
confines
she
had
said
too
that
a
man
who
knew
ashton
was
there
with
her
and
miss
wickham
what
man
wondered
viner
and
what
doing
in
a
district
like
that
toward
which
he
was
speeding
the
chauffeur
did
the
run
to
whitechapel
road
in
unusually
good
time
it
was
little
more
than
two
when
the
car
passed
the
parish
church
but
the
man
had
gone
from
one
end
of
the
road
to
the
other
from
the
end
of
high
street
to
the
beginning
of
mile
end
road
without
success
when
he
stopped
and
looked
in
at
his
passenger
ca
see
no
street
of
that
name
on
either
side
viner
he
said
have
you
got
it
right
sir
that
the
name
given
me
answered
viner
he
pointed
to
a
policeman
slowly
patrolling
the
side
walk
ask
him
he
said
he
know
the
policeman
duly
questioned
seemed
surprised
at
first
then
recollection
evidently
awoke
in
him
mirrypoor
street
he
said
oh
yes
second
to
your
left
third
to
the
right
nice
sort
o
street
for
a
car
like
yours
to
go
into
too
viner
overheard
this
and
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
why
he
demanded
the
policeman
quick
to
recognize
a
superior
person
touched
his
helmet
and
stepped
off
the
curb
toward
his
questioner
pretty
low
quarter
down
there
sir
he
said
with
a
significant
glance
in
the
direction
concerned
if
you
business
that
way
i
should
advise
you
to
look
after
yourself
some
queer
places
down
those
streets
sir
thanks
responded
viner
with
a
grim
smile
go
on
driver
as
quick
as
you
can
and
stop
at
the
corner
of
the
street
the
car
swung
out
of
whitechapel
road
into
a
long
dismal
street
the
shabbiness
of
which
increased
the
further
the
main
thoroughfare
was
left
behind
and
viner
looking
right
and
left
saw
that
the
small
streets
running
off
that
which
he
was
traversing
were
still
more
dismal
still
more
shabby
suddenly
the
car
twisted
to
the
right
and
stopped
and
viner
was
aware
of
a
long
narrow
street
more
gloomy
than
the
rest
wherein
various
individuals
moved
about
and
groups
of
poorly
clad
children
played
in
the
gutters
all
right
he
said
as
he
got
down
from
the
car
and
the
chauffeur
made
a
grimace
at
the
unlovely
vista
look
here
i
do
want
you
to
wait
here
go
back
to
whitechapel
road
and
hang
about
the
end
of
the
street
we
just
come
down
i
come
back
there
to
you
not
afraid
of
going
down
here
alone
then
sir
asked
the
chauffeur
it
a
bit
as
that
policeman
said
i
all
right
repeated
viner
you
go
back
and
wait
i
may
be
some
time
i
may
be
long
he
turned
away
down
the
street
and
in
spite
of
his
declaration
he
felt
that
this
was
certainly
the
most
doubtful
place
he
had
ever
been
in
there
were
evil
and
sinister
faces
on
the
sidewalks
evil
and
sinister
eyes
looking
out
of
dirty
windows
here
and
there
a
figure
went
by
him
in
the
gloom
of
the
december
day
with
the
soft
step
of
a
wild
animal
here
and
there
men
leaning
against
the
wall
glared
suspiciously
at
him
or
fixed
rapacious
eyes
on
his
good
clothes
there
were
shops
in
this
street
such
as
viner
had
never
seen
the
like
of
shops
wherein
coarse
dreadful
looking
food
was
exposed
for
sale
and
there
were
from
which
came
the
odour
of
cheap
gin
and
bad
beer
and
rank
tobacco
an
atmosphere
of
fried
fish
and
something
far
worse
hung
heavily
above
the
dirty
pavements
and
at
every
step
he
took
viner
asked
himself
the
same
question
what
on
earth
could
miss
wickham
and
killenhall
be
doing
in
this
wretched
neighbourhood
suddenly
he
came
to
the
house
he
wanted
number
it
was
just
like
all
the
other
houses
of
sombre
grey
brick
except
for
the
fact
that
it
looked
somewhat
cleaner
than
the
rest
was
furnished
with
blinds
and
curtains
and
in
the
front
downstairs
window
had
a
lower
wire
blind
on
which
was
worked
in
tarnished
gilt
letters
the
word
on
the
door
was
a
brass
plate
also
tarnished
across
which
ran
three
lines
in
black
martincole
attendance
to
saturdays
to
before
viner
took
the
bell
in
hand
he
glanced
at
the
houses
which
flanked
this
surgery
one
was
a
meanly
equipped
chemist
shop
the
other
a
clothing
establishment
and
comforting
himself
with
the
thought
that
if
need
arose
the
apparently
fairly
respectable
proprietors
of
these
places
might
reasonably
be
called
upon
for
assistance
he
rang
the
bell
of
number
and
awaited
the
opening
of
the
door
with
considerable
curiosity
the
door
was
opened
by
killenhall
herself
and
viner
quick
eye
failed
to
notice
anything
in
her
air
or
manner
that
denoted
uneasiness
she
smiled
and
motioned
him
to
enter
shutting
the
door
after
him
as
he
stepped
into
the
narrow
entrance
hall
so
very
good
of
you
to
come
viner
and
so
quickly
she
said
you
found
your
way
all
right
yes
but
i
a
good
deal
surprised
to
find
you
and
miss
wickham
in
this
neighbourhood
answered
viner
this
is
a
queer
place
killenhall
i
hope
oh
we
all
right
said
killenhall
with
a
reassuring
smile
it
is
certainly
a
queer
neighbourhood
but
martincole
is
an
old
friend
of
mine
and
we
safe
enough
under
his
roof
he
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
and
then
this
man
who
knew
mr
ashton
interrupted
viner
where
is
he
martincole
will
bring
him
in
said
killenhall
come
upstairs
mr
viner
viner
noticed
that
the
house
through
which
he
was
led
was
very
quiet
and
larger
than
he
should
have
guessed
at
from
the
street
frontage
from
what
he
could
see
it
was
well
furnished
but
dark
and
gloomy
gloomy
too
was
a
back
room
high
up
the
stairs
into
which
killenhall
presently
showed
him
there
looking
somewhat
anxious
sat
miss
wickham
alone
here
viner
said
killenhall
i
tell
martincole
he
come
she
motioned
viner
to
a
chair
and
went
out
but
the
next
instant
viner
swung
quickly
round
as
the
door
closed
he
had
heard
the
unmistakable
click
of
a
patent
lock
chapter
xxvi
the
dismal
street
unknown
to
those
who
had
taken
part
in
the
conference
at
viner
house
unknown
even
to
carless
who
in
the
multiplicity
of
his
engagements
had
forgotten
the
instructions
which
he
had
given
on
the
previous
afternoon
to
portlethwaite
a
strict
watch
was
being
kept
on
the
man
around
whom
all
the
events
of
that
morning
had
centred
portlethwaite
after
methley
and
his
client
had
left
carless
and
driver
office
had
given
certain
instructions
to
one
of
his
a
man
named
millwaters
in
whose
prowess
as
a
spy
he
had
unlimited
belief
millwaters
was
a
fellow
of
experience
he
possessed
all
the
qualities
of
a
and
was
not
easily
baffled
in
difficult
adventures
in
his
time
he
had
watched
erring
husbands
and
doubtful
wives
he
had
followed
more
than
one
running
away
from
the
consequences
of
forgery
or
embezzlement
he
had
conducted
secret
investigations
into
the
behaviour
of
persons
about
whom
his
employers
wanted
to
know
something
in
person
and
appearance
he
was
eminently
fitted
for
his
job
a
little
inconspicuous
man
who
contrived
to
look
as
if
he
never
saw
anything
and
to
him
knowing
that
he
was
to
be
thoroughly
depended
upon
portlethwaite
had
given
precise
orders
you
go
up
to
lancaster
gate
tonight
millwaters
and
get
a
good
look
at
that
chap
portlethwaite
had
told
him
take
plenty
of
money
speak
to
the
cashier
about
that
and
be
prepared
for
anything
even
to
following
if
he
bolts
once
you
seen
him
you
not
to
lose
sight
of
him
make
sure
of
him
last
thing
today
and
first
thing
tomorrow
follow
him
wherever
he
goes
make
a
note
of
wherever
he
goes
and
particularly
of
whoever
he
meets
and
if
there
need
ring
me
up
here
and
let
know
what
happening
or
if
you
want
assistance
there
was
no
need
for
millwaters
to
promise
faithful
compliance
portlethwaite
knew
well
enough
that
to
put
him
on
a
trail
was
equivalent
to
putting
a
hound
on
the
scent
of
a
fox
or
a
terrier
to
the
run
of
a
rat
and
that
evening
millwaters
who
had
clever
ways
of
his
own
made
himself
well
acquainted
with
the
cave
appearance
and
assured
himself
that
his
man
had
gone
peacefully
to
rest
at
his
hotel
and
he
had
seen
him
again
before
breakfast
next
morning
and
had
been
in
quiet
and
unobtrusive
attendance
upon
him
when
later
he
visited
methley
office
and
subsequently
walked
away
with
methley
to
the
and
millwaters
was
in
the
meditatively
sucking
peppermint
lozenges
in
a
corner
when
cave
was
unexpectedly
asked
to
give
evidence
he
was
there
too
until
cave
left
the
court
cave
remarkable
story
ran
off
millwaters
mentality
like
raindrops
off
a
steep
roof
it
mattered
nothing
to
him
he
did
not
care
the
value
of
a
brass
button
if
cave
was
earl
of
ellingham
or
duke
of
ditchmoor
his
job
was
to
keep
his
eye
on
him
whoever
he
was
and
so
when
viner
and
his
party
went
round
to
markendale
square
millwaters
slunk
along
in
their
rear
and
at
a
corner
of
the
square
he
remained
lounging
about
until
his
quarry
reappeared
two
or
three
of
the
other
men
came
out
with
cave
but
millwaters
noticed
that
cave
immediately
separated
from
them
he
was
evidently
impressing
upon
them
that
he
was
in
a
great
hurry
about
something
or
other
and
sped
away
from
them
millwaters
cold
eye
upon
him
and
within
a
minute
millwaters
had
observed
what
seemed
to
him
highly
suspicious
circumstance
cave
on
leaving
the
others
had
shot
off
down
a
in
the
direction
of
lancaster
gate
but
as
soon
as
he
was
out
of
sight
of
markendale
square
had
doubled
in
his
tracks
hurried
down
another
turning
and
sped
away
as
fast
as
he
could
walk
towards
paddington
station
millwaters
shorter
in
the
leg
than
the
tall
man
in
front
had
to
hurry
to
keep
him
in
sight
but
he
was
never
far
behind
as
cave
hastened
along
craven
road
and
made
for
the
terminus
once
or
twice
in
this
chase
the
quarry
lifted
a
hand
to
an
approaching
taxicab
only
to
find
each
was
engaged
it
was
not
until
he
and
his
pursuer
were
in
front
of
the
great
western
hotel
that
cave
found
an
empty
cab
hailed
it
and
sprang
in
millwaters
grinned
quietly
at
that
he
was
used
to
this
sort
of
chase
and
he
had
memorized
car
and
number
before
cave
had
been
driven
off
it
was
a
mere
detail
to
charter
the
next
and
to
give
a
quiet
word
and
wink
to
its
chauffeur
who
was
opening
its
door
for
millwaters
when
a
third
person
came
gently
alongside
and
tapped
the
clerk
shoulder
millwaters
turned
sharply
and
encountered
perkwite
shrewd
eyes
all
right
millwaters
said
the
barrister
i
know
what
you
after
i
after
the
same
bird
we
go
together
millwaters
knew
perkwite
very
well
as
a
promising
young
barrister
whom
carless
and
driver
sometimes
favoured
with
briefs
perkwite
presence
did
not
disturb
him
he
moved
into
the
farther
corner
and
perkwite
slipped
inside
the
car
moved
off
in
pursuit
of
the
one
in
front
so
you
on
that
game
mr
perkwite
remarked
millwaters
ah
and
who
might
have
got
you
on
to
it
if
one
may
ask
you
know
that
i
was
at
your
people
office
yesterday
said
perkwite
saw
you
there
replied
millwaters
it
was
about
this
business
said
the
barrister
did
you
see
me
in
the
this
morning
i
did
listening
for
all
you
were
worth
answered
the
clerk
and
i
dare
say
you
saw
me
go
with
the
rest
of
them
to
viner
in
markendale
square
said
perkwite
right
again
sir
assented
millwaters
i
did
this
fellow
in
front
observed
perkwite
made
some
statements
at
viner
in
answer
to
your
principal
carless
which
incline
me
to
the
opinion
that
he
an
impostor
in
spite
of
his
carefully
concocted
stories
should
wonder
mr
perkwite
said
millwaters
but
that
not
my
business
my
job
is
to
keep
him
under
observation
that
what
i
set
out
to
do
when
i
came
out
of
viner
said
the
barrister
he
up
to
something
he
assured
us
as
we
left
the
house
that
he
a
most
pressing
engagement
at
his
hotel
in
lancaster
gate
the
next
minute
happening
to
glance
down
a
i
saw
him
cutting
off
in
the
direction
of
paddington
and
now
he
evidently
making
for
the
city
well
i
after
him
remarked
millwaters
he
leaned
out
of
his
window
called
the
chauffeur
and
gave
him
some
further
instructions
intelligent
chap
this
perkwite
he
said
as
he
sat
down
again
he
understands
some
of
are
poor
hands
at
this
sort
of
game
you
a
pretty
good
hand
yourself
i
think
suggested
the
barrister
with
a
smile
ought
to
be
said
millwaters
had
plenty
of
experience
anyway
it
seemed
to
perkwite
that
his
companion
kept
no
particular
observation
on
the
car
in
front
as
it
sped
along
to
and
through
the
northern
edge
of
the
city
and
beyond
but
millwaters
woke
to
action
as
their
own
car
progressed
up
whitechapel
road
and
suddenly
he
gave
a
warning
word
to
the
barrister
and
a
smart
tap
on
the
window
behind
their
driver
the
car
came
to
a
halt
by
the
curb
and
millwaters
slipping
out
pushed
some
money
into
the
man
hand
and
drew
perkwite
amongst
the
people
who
were
crowding
the
sidewalk
the
barrister
looked
in
front
and
around
and
seemed
at
a
loss
where
is
he
he
asked
hang
it
i
lost
him
i
have
said
millwaters
he
left
his
car
before
we
left
ours
our
man
knew
what
he
was
after
he
slowed
up
and
passed
him
until
i
saw
where
he
went
he
twisted
perkwite
round
and
pointed
to
the
mouth
of
a
street
which
they
had
just
passed
he
gone
down
there
he
said
nice
neighbourhood
too
i
know
something
of
it
now
perkwite
if
you
please
we
separate
you
take
the
right
of
that
street
i
take
the
left
keep
a
look
out
for
my
gentleman
homburg
hat
grey
with
a
black
band
and
keep
the
tail
of
your
eye
on
me
too
cave
headgear
was
easily
followed
down
the
squalid
street
its
owner
went
swiftly
ahead
with
millwaters
in
pursuit
on
one
pavement
and
the
barrister
on
the
other
until
he
finally
turned
into
a
narrower
and
shabbier
thoroughfare
then
the
clerk
hurried
across
the
road
attracted
perkwite
attention
winked
at
him
as
he
passed
without
checking
his
pace
and
whispered
two
or
three
words
wait
by
the
perkwite
pulled
up
and
millwaters
went
down
the
dismal
street
in
pursuit
of
the
homburg
hat
this
excellent
indication
of
its
presence
suddenly
vanished
from
perkwite
sight
and
presently
millwaters
came
back
ran
him
to
earth
for
the
time
being
anyway
he
said
he
gone
into
a
surgery
down
there
a
martincole
number
brass
plate
on
door
next
to
a
suspicious
sort
of
spot
altogether
well
demanded
perkwite
what
next
you
know
best
millwaters
the
clerk
jerked
a
thumb
down
the
side
of
the
dismal
street
on
which
they
were
standing
there
a
down
there
he
said
almost
opposite
this
surgery
fairly
decent
place
for
this
neighbourhood
looking
out
on
the
street
better
slip
in
there
and
look
quietly
out
but
remember
perkwite
do
seem
to
be
watching
anything
we
just
going
in
for
a
bottle
of
ale
and
talking
business
together
whatever
you
recommend
said
perkwite
he
followed
his
companion
down
the
street
to
the
tavern
a
joyless
and
shabby
place
the
of
which
a
dark
and
room
was
just
then
empty
and
looked
over
its
torn
across
the
way
certainly
a
queer
place
for
a
man
who
professes
to
be
a
peer
of
the
realm
to
visit
he
muttered
well
now
what
do
you
propose
to
do
millwaters
hang
about
here
and
watch
whispered
the
clerk
look
out
a
face
heavy
and
bloated
appeared
at
a
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
a
gruff
voice
made
itself
heard
any
orders
gents
two
bottles
o
bass
responded
millwaters
promptly
dropping
into
colloquial
cockney
speech
he
turned
to
perkwite
and
winked
well
an
wot
abaht
this
bit
o
business
as
i
come
rahnd
abaht
mister
he
went
on
nudging
his
companion
in
style
yer
see
it
this
ere
wy
wiv
us
if
yer
can
let
us
have
that
there
stuff
reasonable
see
he
drew
perkwite
over
to
the
window
and
began
to
whisper
that
satisfy
him
he
said
with
a
sharp
glance
at
the
little
room
behind
the
hatch
where
the
landlord
was
drawing
corks
he
think
we
doing
a
bit
of
trade
so
we
nothing
to
do
but
stand
in
this
window
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
street
out
of
this
i
not
going
till
i
see
whether
that
fellow
comes
out
or
stops
in
some
time
had
passed
and
millwaters
had
been
obliged
to
repeat
his
order
for
bottled
bass
before
anything
took
place
in
the
street
outside
suddenly
he
touched
his
companion
elbow
here
a
taxicab
coming
along
and
slowing
up
for
somewhere
about
here
he
whispered
and
lord
if
there
are
two
ladies
in
it
in
a
spot
like
this
and
whew
he
went
on
excitedly
do
you
see
perkwite
the
young
un
miss
wickham
who
came
to
our
office
about
this
ashton
affair
i
do
know
who
the
old
un
is
but
she
evidently
knows
her
way
the
landlord
had
now
shut
down
the
hatch
and
his
two
customers
were
alone
and
unobserved
perkwite
drew
away
from
the
window
pulling
millwaters
by
the
sleeve
careful
he
said
there
something
seriously
wrong
here
millwaters
what
miss
wickham
being
brought
down
here
for
see
they
gone
into
that
surgery
and
the
car
going
off
look
here
we
got
to
do
something
and
at
once
but
millwaters
shook
his
head
not
my
job
mr
perkwite
he
answered
my
business
is
with
the
man
cave
i
nothing
to
do
with
miss
wickham
sir
nor
with
the
old
lady
that
taken
her
in
there
cave
my
mark
queer
that
the
young
gone
there
no
doubt
but
no
affair
of
mine
it
going
to
be
an
affair
of
mine
then
said
perkwite
i
going
off
to
the
police
millwaters
put
out
a
detaining
hand
do
mr
perkwite
he
said
to
get
police
into
a
quarter
like
this
is
as
bad
as
putting
a
light
to
dry
straw
i
tell
you
a
better
plan
than
that
sir
find
the
nearest
and
call
up
our
people
call
carless
tell
him
what
you
seen
and
get
him
to
come
down
and
bring
somebody
with
him
that
be
far
better
than
calling
the
police
in
give
me
your
then
said
perkwite
and
keep
a
strict
watch
while
i
away
millwaters
repeated
some
figures
and
a
letter
and
perkwite
ran
off
up
the
street
and
toward
the
whitechapel
road
anxiously
seeking
for
a
telephone
booth
it
was
not
until
he
had
got
into
the
main
thoroughfare
that
he
found
one
he
then
had
some
slight
delay
in
getting
in
communication
with
carless
and
driver
office
twenty
minutes
had
elapsed
by
the
time
he
got
back
to
the
dismal
street
at
its
corner
he
encountered
millwaters
lounging
about
hands
in
pockets
millwaters
wagged
his
head
here
another
queer
go
he
said
there
been
another
arrival
at
number
not
five
minutes
since
another
of
our
little
lot
who
demanded
perkwite
viner
replied
millwaters
came
peeping
and
perking
along
the
street
took
a
glimpse
of
the
premises
and
the
adjacent
purlieus
rang
at
number
and
was
let
in
by
the
party
that
came
with
miss
wickham
now
whatever
can
he
be
doing
there
mr
perkwite
whatever
can
any
of
them
be
doing
there
muttered
perkwite
viner
what
business
can
he
have
in
this
place
it
seems
by
george
millwaters
he
suddenly
exclaimed
what
if
this
is
some
infernal
plant
trap
something
of
that
sort
do
you
know
in
spite
of
what
you
say
i
really
think
we
ought
to
get
hold
of
the
nearest
police
and
tell
them
wait
mr
perkwite
counselled
millwaters
our
governor
is
a
pretty
cute
and
smart
sort
and
he
vastly
interested
in
this
miss
wickham
so
portlethwaite
and
he
be
on
their
way
down
here
now
hot
foot
and
with
help
too
if
he
thinks
she
in
any
danger
now
can
go
straight
to
that
door
and
demand
to
see
her
and
why
ca
we
interrupted
perkwite
i
do
it
lord
man
she
may
be
in
real
peril
not
while
viner
in
there
said
millwaters
quietly
i
might
possibly
have
gone
and
rung
the
bell
myself
but
for
that
but
viner
in
there
wait
and
perkwite
waited
chafing
at
the
corner
of
the
dismal
street
until
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
passed
then
a
car
came
hurrying
along
and
pulled
up
as
millwaters
and
his
companion
were
reached
and
from
it
sprang
carless
lord
ellingham
and
two
men
in
at
the
sight
of
whom
perkwite
heaved
a
huge
sigh
of
intense
relief
chapter
xxvii
the
back
way
viner
was
so
sure
that
the
sound
which
he
had
heard
on
retirement
was
that
caused
by
the
turning
of
a
key
or
slipping
of
a
lock
in
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
that
before
speaking
to
miss
wickham
he
instantly
stepped
back
and
tried
it
to
his
astonishment
it
opened
readily
but
the
anteroom
outside
was
empty
killenhall
had
evidently
walked
straight
through
it
and
disappeared
that
odd
he
said
turning
to
miss
wickham
i
distinctly
thought
i
heard
something
like
the
snap
of
a
lock
or
a
bolt
or
something
did
you
i
certainly
heard
a
sound
of
that
sort
admitted
miss
wickham
but
the
door
open
is
it
yes
that
is
so
answered
viner
who
was
distinctly
puzzled
yet
but
then
all
this
seems
very
odd
when
did
you
come
down
here
about
an
hour
ago
replied
miss
wickham
in
a
hurry
do
you
know
why
asked
viner
to
see
a
martincole
who
is
to
tell
us
something
about
ashton
replied
his
in
these
strange
quarters
did
killenhall
ask
you
to
come
down
for
the
same
purpose
mr
viner
viner
before
he
replied
looked
round
the
room
considering
the
extreme
shabbiness
and
squalour
of
the
surrounding
district
he
was
greatly
surprised
to
find
that
the
apartment
in
which
he
and
miss
wickham
waited
was
extremely
well
furnished
if
in
an
and
rather
heavy
way
the
walls
were
panelled
in
dark
oak
to
the
height
of
several
feet
above
the
panelling
were
arranged
good
oil
pictures
which
viner
would
have
liked
to
examine
at
his
leisure
here
and
there
in
cabinets
were
many
promising
curiosities
there
were
old
silver
and
brass
things
and
a
shelf
or
two
of
books
altogether
the
place
and
its
effects
were
certainly
not
what
viner
had
expected
to
find
in
such
a
quarter
yes
he
said
at
last
turning
to
his
companion
that
what
i
was
brought
here
for
well
have
you
seen
this
doctor
no
answered
miss
wickham
not
yet
know
anything
about
him
suggested
viner
nothing
whatever
i
have
heard
of
him
said
miss
wickham
with
a
glance
of
surprise
i
suppose
he
somehow
got
into
touch
with
miss
killenhall
queer
remarked
viner
and
why
does
he
come
in
then
resolved
to
know
more
he
walked
into
the
anteroom
and
after
a
look
round
it
tried
the
door
by
which
killenhall
had
admitted
him
after
coming
up
the
stairs
from
the
street
a
second
later
he
went
back
to
miss
wickham
and
shook
his
head
it
just
as
i
supposed
he
remarked
quietly
we
trapped
anyway
the
door
of
that
anteroom
is
locked
and
it
a
strong
lock
something
wrong
the
girl
started
and
paled
a
little
but
viner
saw
at
once
that
she
was
not
likely
to
be
seriously
frightened
and
presently
she
laughed
how
very
queer
she
said
but
perhaps
killenhall
turned
the
key
in
the
outer
lock
so
that
no
patients
or
other
callers
perhaps
should
come
in
sorry
but
that
does
strike
me
as
a
good
suggestion
replied
viner
i
going
to
have
a
look
at
that
window
the
one
window
of
the
room
a
long
low
one
was
set
high
in
the
wall
above
the
panelling
viner
had
to
climb
on
a
bookcase
to
get
at
it
and
when
he
had
reached
it
he
found
it
to
be
securely
fastened
and
to
have
in
front
of
it
at
a
distance
of
no
more
than
a
yard
a
blank
whitewashed
wall
which
evidently
rose
from
a
passage
between
that
and
the
next
house
i
do
like
the
look
of
this
at
all
he
said
as
he
got
down
from
the
bookcase
it
seems
to
me
that
we
might
be
kept
here
for
a
long
time
miss
wickham
showed
more
astonishment
than
fear
but
why
should
any
one
want
to
keep
us
here
for
any
time
she
asked
what
it
mean
i
wish
i
knew
exclaimed
viner
he
pulled
out
his
watch
and
made
a
mental
note
of
the
time
we
being
kept
much
longer
than
we
should
be
in
any
ordinary
case
he
remarked
of
course
admitted
miss
wickham
well
past
three
it
if
we
delayed
much
longer
killenhall
will
be
too
late
for
the
bank
what
bank
asked
viner
my
bank
i
always
give
killenhall
a
check
for
the
weekly
bills
every
friday
and
as
we
were
coming
through
the
city
to
get
here
she
said
just
before
we
left
home
that
i
might
as
well
give
her
the
check
and
she
could
call
and
cash
it
as
we
drove
back
and
concluded
miss
wickham
the
bank
closes
at
four
viner
began
to
be
suspicious
look
here
he
said
suddenly
do
think
me
inquisitive
but
what
was
the
amount
of
the
check
you
gave
her
there
was
no
amount
stated
replied
miss
wickham
i
always
give
her
a
blank
check
signed
of
course
and
she
fills
in
the
amount
herself
it
varies
according
to
what
she
wants
without
expressing
any
opinion
on
the
wisdom
of
handing
checks
to
other
people
on
this
plan
viner
turned
to
miss
wickham
with
a
further
question
do
you
know
anything
about
killenhall
movements
this
morning
he
asked
did
she
go
out
anywhere
yes
replied
miss
wickham
she
went
to
the
to
hear
the
proceedings
against
hyde
she
wanted
me
to
go
but
i
would
i
dislike
that
sort
of
thing
she
was
there
all
the
morning
so
was
i
said
viner
i
did
see
her
but
the
place
was
crowded
and
she
was
veiled
remarked
miss
wickham
naturally
she
did
want
people
to
see
her
in
a
place
like
that
do
you
know
whether
she
went
to
the
previous
sitting
i
mean
when
hyde
was
brought
up
the
first
time
inquired
viner
i
remember
there
were
some
veiled
ladies
there
and
at
the
coroner
inquest
too
she
was
at
the
coroner
inquest
i
know
replied
miss
wickham
i
do
know
about
the
other
time
viner
made
no
remark
and
miss
wickham
suddenly
lowered
her
voice
and
bent
nearer
to
him
why
she
asked
are
you
suspecting
killenhall
of
anything
mr
viner
viner
gave
her
a
quick
glance
are
you
he
said
in
low
tones
miss
wickham
waved
a
hand
towards
the
anteroom
well
she
whispered
what
it
look
like
she
brings
me
down
here
in
a
hurry
on
a
message
which
i
myself
never
heard
nor
saw
delivered
in
any
way
after
i
get
here
you
are
fetched
and
here
we
are
and
where
is
she
and
possibly
a
much
more
pertinent
question
said
viner
where
is
this
martincole
look
here
this
is
a
room
those
pictures
are
good
there
are
many
valuable
things
here
yet
the
man
who
practises
here
is
only
in
attendance
for
an
hour
or
two
in
an
afternoon
and
once
a
week
for
rather
longer
in
the
evening
he
ca
earn
much
here
certainly
an
east
end
doctor
could
not
afford
to
buy
things
like
this
or
that
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
think
this
man
is
some
west
end
man
who
for
purposes
of
his
own
has
this
place
down
here
a
man
who
probably
lives
a
double
life
and
may
possibly
be
mixed
up
in
some
nefarious
practices
and
so
i
propose
as
we
waited
long
enough
to
get
out
of
it
and
i
going
to
smash
that
window
and
yell
as
loud
as
i
can
somebody
will
hear
it
miss
wickham
pointed
to
a
door
in
the
oak
panelling
a
door
set
in
a
corner
of
the
room
across
which
hung
a
heavy
curtain
of
red
plush
only
halfdrawn
there
a
door
there
she
remarked
but
i
suppose
it
only
a
cupboard
sure
to
be
said
viner
however
we
see
he
went
across
drew
the
curtain
aside
tried
the
door
looked
within
and
uttered
an
exclamation
i
say
he
called
back
stairs
miss
wickham
came
across
and
looked
past
his
shoulder
there
was
certainly
the
head
of
a
staircase
before
him
and
a
few
stairs
to
be
seen
before
darkness
swallowed
up
the
rest
but
the
darkness
was
deep
and
the
atmosphere
that
came
up
from
below
decidedly
musty
are
you
going
down
there
she
asked
i
do
like
it
it
seems
our
only
chance
answered
viner
he
looked
back
into
the
room
and
seeing
some
wax
candles
standing
on
a
seized
one
and
lighted
it
come
along
he
said
let
get
out
of
this
altogether
miss
wickham
gathered
up
her
skirts
and
followed
down
the
stairs
viner
going
cautiously
in
front
with
the
light
held
before
him
in
such
a
fashion
that
he
could
see
every
step
at
a
turn
in
the
stairway
he
came
across
a
door
and
opening
it
saw
that
it
stood
at
the
end
of
a
narrow
passage
running
through
the
house
at
the
farther
end
of
the
passage
he
recognized
an
oak
cabinet
which
he
had
noticed
when
killenhall
first
admitted
him
i
see
how
these
people
whoever
they
are
manage
matters
he
remarked
over
his
shoulder
as
he
led
his
companion
forward
this
place
has
a
front
and
a
back
entrance
if
you
do
want
to
be
seen
you
know
well
it
convenient
we
approaching
the
back
and
here
it
is
the
stairs
came
to
an
end
deep
down
in
the
house
terminating
in
a
door
which
viner
after
leaving
his
candle
only
blown
out
on
the
last
step
carefully
opened
there
before
him
lay
a
narrow
whitewashed
yard
at
the
end
of
which
they
could
see
a
street
evidently
pretty
much
like
the
rest
of
the
streets
in
that
district
but
in
the
yard
a
urchin
was
feeding
a
couple
of
rabbits
in
a
and
him
viner
immediately
hailed
you
a
lad
he
said
would
you
like
five
shillings
well
have
you
seen
martincole
this
afternoon
you
know
the
doctor
who
comes
to
the
house
behind
us
see
him
go
out
abaht
an
hour
ago
wiv
anuvver
gent
said
the
lad
eagerly
his
bright
eyes
wavering
between
viner
face
and
the
hand
which
he
had
thrust
in
his
pocket
he
pointed
to
the
distant
entrance
of
the
yard
went
aht
that
way
they
did
ah
and
what
was
the
other
gentleman
like
asked
viner
swell
answered
the
informant
proper
swell
he
was
and
dr
martincole
viner
continued
you
seen
him
many
a
time
of
course
now
what
he
like
he
a
tall
gentleman
said
the
boy
after
some
evidently
painful
thought
yes
but
what
else
has
he
got
a
beard
asked
viner
could
tell
you
that
see
said
the
lad
one
o
them
gents
what
allus
wears
a
white
silk
handkercher
abaht
his
face
up
to
his
eyes
but
he
a
big
man
wears
black
clothes
viner
gave
the
boy
his
promised
reward
and
was
passing
on
when
miss
wickham
touched
his
arm
ask
if
he
seen
a
lady
go
out
this
way
she
said
that
equally
important
the
boy
duly
questioned
nodded
his
head
i
see
killerby
go
out
not
so
long
since
he
answered
her
what
used
to
live
here
one
time
know
her
well
enough
come
along
muttered
viner
we
hit
it
killerby
who
is
killenhall
used
to
live
here
at
one
time
good
which
means
very
bad
considering
that
without
doubt
the
doctor
who
wears
a
white
silk
handkerchief
about
his
face
is
the
muffled
man
of
lonsdale
passage
miss
wickham
something
has
alarmed
these
birds
and
they
flown
but
why
were
we
brought
here
asked
miss
wickham
i
an
idea
as
to
why
you
were
said
viner
and
i
propose
to
find
out
at
once
if
i
right
let
get
away
find
a
taxicab
and
go
to
your
but
good
heavens
he
went
on
breaking
off
as
two
men
came
into
the
yard
here
one
of
carless
clerks
and
perkwite
the
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
as
millwaters
and
perkwite
hurried
up
are
you
after
anybody
along
there
in
that
house
the
one
at
the
end
we
after
a
good
many
things
and
people
in
martincole
place
viner
answered
millwaters
perkwite
and
i
traced
cave
here
early
in
the
afternoon
he
went
in
but
he
never
come
out
we
saw
you
enter
here
you
are
we
saw
miss
wickham
and
killenhall
miss
wickham
but
where
the
other
lady
and
where
viner
stopped
the
clerk
questions
with
a
glance
and
he
laughed
a
little
as
he
gave
him
his
answer
my
dear
fellow
he
said
you
should
have
posted
somebody
at
the
back
here
why
we
do
quite
know
yet
but
miss
wickham
and
myself
were
trapped
in
there
as
for
cave
he
must
be
the
man
who
went
away
with
martincole
as
for
killenhall
she
too
has
gone
that
boy
down
there
saw
all
three
go
some
time
ago
while
we
were
locked
up
but
what
made
you
watch
these
people
we
followed
cave
said
perkwite
because
millwaters
had
been
ordered
to
do
so
and
because
i
considered
his
conduct
mysterious
then
when
we
saw
what
was
going
on
here
your
arrival
following
on
that
of
miss
wickham
and
killenhall
we
telephoned
for
carless
and
more
help
carless
and
lord
ellingham
and
a
couple
of
detectives
are
at
the
front
now
millwaters
and
i
heard
from
a
denizen
of
these
unlovely
parts
that
there
was
a
back
entrance
we
tried
in
vain
for
admittance
at
the
front
but
they
got
in
now
mr
perkwite
exclaimed
millwaters
suddenly
see
there
carless
at
a
back
window
waving
to
us
to
come
in
i
suppose
we
can
get
in
by
the
back
mr
viner
yes
if
you
like
to
take
the
risk
of
entering
people
houses
without
permission
said
viner
sardonically
i
do
think
you
find
anybody
or
anything
there
as
for
miss
wickham
and
myself
we
an
engagement
elsewhere
he
hurried
his
companion
away
through
the
street
on
which
they
emerged
from
the
whitewashed
yard
and
out
into
the
whitechapel
road
he
hurried
her
too
into
the
first
taxicab
which
came
along
empty
now
he
said
as
they
stepped
in
tell
this
man
the
name
of
your
bank
and
let
him
go
there
quick
chapter
xxviii
the
truth
four
had
struck
and
the
doors
of
the
bank
were
closed
when
miss
wickham
and
viner
hurried
up
to
it
but
there
was
a
private
entrance
at
the
side
and
the
man
who
answered
their
summons
made
no
difficulty
about
admitting
them
when
miss
wickham
said
who
she
was
and
within
a
few
minutes
they
were
closeted
with
a
manager
who
surprised
when
they
entered
was
astonished
before
many
words
had
been
exchanged
for
during
their
dash
from
the
whitechapel
streets
viner
had
coached
his
companion
as
to
the
questions
he
wished
her
to
put
on
arrival
at
the
bank
and
she
went
straight
to
the
point
i
wanted
to
know
if
my
companion
killenhall
had
called
here
this
afternoon
begun
miss
wickham
she
has
answered
the
manager
i
happened
to
see
her
and
i
attended
to
her
myself
did
she
present
a
check
from
me
inquired
miss
wickham
certainly
and
i
cashed
it
said
the
manager
he
gave
his
customer
and
her
companion
a
look
of
interrogation
which
had
a
good
deal
of
surprise
in
it
why
he
continued
glancing
at
miss
wickham
it
in
order
that
replied
miss
wickham
depends
upon
the
amount
the
amount
he
exclaimed
you
know
if
the
drawer
it
was
for
ten
thousand
pounds
then
killenhall
has
done
me
or
you
out
of
that
said
miss
wickham
the
check
i
gave
her
was
to
have
been
filled
up
for
the
amount
of
the
usual
weekly
bills
twenty
pounds
or
so
ten
thousand
ridiculous
but
it
all
seemed
in
order
exclaimed
the
concerned
manager
she
was
as
plausible
and
all
that
and
really
you
know
miss
wickham
we
know
her
very
well
and
in
addition
to
that
you
have
a
very
large
balance
lying
here
killenhall
merely
mentioned
that
you
wanted
this
amount
in
notes
and
that
she
had
called
for
it
and
of
course
i
cashed
the
check
your
check
remember
at
once
i
had
filled
in
the
amount
remarked
miss
wickham
killenhall
had
often
presented
checks
bearing
your
signature
in
which
you
had
filled
in
the
amount
said
the
manager
there
was
nothing
unusual
i
assure
you
in
any
detail
of
the
affair
the
most
important
detail
now
observed
viner
dryly
is
to
find
mrs
killenhall
the
manager
who
was
obviously
filled
with
amazement
at
audacity
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
his
visitors
as
if
he
could
scarcely
credit
their
suggestion
you
really
mean
me
to
believe
that
killenhall
has
got
ten
thousand
pounds
out
of
miss
wickham
by
a
trick
he
asked
fixing
his
gaze
at
last
on
viner
what
i
really
mean
you
to
believe
said
viner
rising
is
that
a
rapid
series
of
events
this
afternoon
has
proved
to
me
that
killenhall
is
one
of
a
gang
who
are
responsible
for
the
murder
of
john
ashton
who
stole
his
diamond
and
certain
papers
and
who
have
endeavoured
very
cleverly
to
foist
one
of
their
number
a
scoundrelly
clever
actor
on
the
public
as
a
peer
of
the
realm
who
had
been
missing
killenhall
who
has
another
name
probably
got
wind
of
possible
detection
about
noon
today
and
took
advantage
of
miss
wickham
habit
of
giving
her
a
weekly
check
to
provide
herself
with
ample
funds
really
about
the
truth
and
i
think
miss
wickham
and
i
had
better
be
seeing
the
police
the
very
best
thing
you
can
do
responded
the
manager
with
alacrity
and
take
my
advice
and
go
straight
to
headquarters
go
to
new
scotland
yard
just
think
what
this
woman
and
her
accomplices
could
do
if
she
or
they
had
one
hour
start
of
you
they
can
have
already
put
a
good
distance
between
themselves
and
london
they
can
be
halfway
to
dover
or
harwich
or
southampton
and
therefore
and
therefore
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
set
somebody
on
their
trail
interrupted
viner
and
hurried
miss
wickham
out
of
the
room
and
away
to
the
taxicab
which
he
had
purposely
kept
in
waiting
i
do
think
killenhall
or
killerby
or
whatever
her
name
is
will
have
hurried
away
as
quickly
as
all
that
he
remarked
as
they
sped
along
toward
whitehall
my
own
idea
is
that
having
got
hold
of
your
money
she
probably
have
made
for
the
headquarters
of
this
precious
gang
she
and
they
are
sure
to
have
one
for
i
should
say
the
place
in
whitechapel
was
only
an
outpost
and
they
be
better
able
to
arrange
an
escape
from
there
than
she
would
to
make
an
immediate
flight
she
but
what
are
you
thinking
that
i
seem
to
be
involved
somehow
in
a
very
strange
and
curious
combination
of
things
answered
miss
wickham
just
so
agreed
viner
so
do
i
and
i
was
literally
pitchforked
into
the
very
midst
of
it
all
by
sheer
accident
if
i
had
happened
to
go
out
for
a
late
stroll
on
the
night
on
which
it
began
i
should
never
have
but
here
we
are
the
official
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
with
whom
they
were
shortly
closeted
listened
carefully
and
silently
to
viner
account
of
all
that
had
happened
he
was
one
of
those
individuals
who
never
interrupt
and
always
understand
and
at
the
close
of
viner
story
he
said
exactly
what
the
narrator
was
thinking
the
real
truth
of
all
this
viner
he
said
is
that
this
is
probably
one
of
the
last
chapters
in
the
history
of
the
lonsdale
passage
murder
for
if
you
find
this
woman
and
the
men
who
are
undoubtedly
her
accomplices
you
will
most
likely
have
found
in
one
or
other
of
them
the
murderer
of
john
ashton
precisely
agreed
viner
precisely
the
official
rose
from
his
seat
and
turned
to
the
door
drillford
of
your
nearest
had
this
case
in
charge
he
remarked
i
just
call
him
on
the
telephone
he
left
the
room
and
was
away
for
several
minutes
when
he
returned
there
was
something
like
a
smile
on
his
face
if
you
and
miss
wickham
will
drive
along
and
see
drillford
viner
he
said
i
think
you
find
he
some
news
for
you
has
he
told
it
to
you
demanded
viner
well
just
a
little
answered
the
official
with
another
smile
but
i
wo
rob
him
of
the
pleasure
of
telling
you
himself
you
ought
to
be
disappointed
however
i
just
tell
you
enough
to
whet
your
appetite
for
more
drillford
is
confident
that
he
just
arrested
the
real
man
no
no
more
he
added
with
a
laugh
you
run
up
there
in
twenty
minutes
drillford
cool
and
confident
as
ever
was
alone
in
his
office
when
viner
and
his
companion
were
shown
in
he
looked
at
miss
wickham
with
considerable
curiosity
as
he
handed
her
a
chair
and
viner
noticed
that
the
bow
he
made
her
was
unusually
respectful
but
he
immediately
plunged
into
the
pertinent
subject
and
turned
to
viner
with
a
laugh
of
well
mr
viner
he
said
you
were
right
and
i
was
wrong
it
that
young
fellow
hyde
who
killed
ashton
and
now
that
i
know
who
did
i
do
mind
saying
that
i
jolly
glad
that
his
innocence
will
be
established
but
do
you
know
who
did
asked
viner
eagerly
i
do
answered
drillford
who
then
exclaimed
viner
he
in
the
cells
at
the
back
now
said
drillford
and
i
only
hope
he
not
one
of
those
chaps
who
are
so
clever
that
they
can
secrete
poison
to
the
very
last
moment
and
then
cheat
the
gallows
for
now
that
i
know
as
much
as
i
do
i
should
say
he
as
pretty
a
specimen
of
the
accomplished
scoundrel
as
ever
put
on
fine
clothes
cortelyon
of
your
square
this
sudden
and
surprising
revelation
made
in
ordinary
tones
produced
different
effects
on
the
two
people
to
whom
it
was
made
viner
after
a
start
and
a
smothered
exclamation
stared
silently
at
drillford
as
if
he
scarcely
comprehended
his
meaning
but
miss
wickham
with
a
quick
flush
which
evidently
denoted
recollection
broke
into
words
dr
cortelyon
she
exclaimed
ah
i
remember
now
ashton
once
told
me
in
quite
a
casual
way
as
we
were
passing
through
the
square
that
he
had
known
cortelyon
in
australia
years
and
years
ago
drillford
glanced
at
viner
and
smiled
i
wish
you
remembered
that
little
matter
before
miss
wickham
he
said
it
might
have
saved
a
lot
of
trouble
well
cortelyon
the
man
and
it
all
came
about
quite
suddenly
this
afternoon
through
your
aunt
viner
miss
penkridge
smart
lady
sir
my
aunt
exclaimed
viner
why
how
on
earth
some
of
your
gentlemen
had
a
conference
with
that
fellow
cave
at
your
house
after
you
left
court
this
morning
said
drillford
miss
penkridge
was
present
cave
told
more
of
his
story
and
produced
a
certain
letter
which
he
said
had
been
handed
to
him
at
the
hotel
he
put
up
at
all
that
and
all
the
stuff
he
told
at
the
was
bluff
carefully
concocted
by
himself
and
cortelyon
in
case
cave
was
ever
put
in
a
tight
corner
now
according
to
what
she
tells
me
miss
penkridge
immediately
spotted
something
about
that
letter
which
none
of
you
gentlemen
were
clever
enough
to
see
i
know
interrupted
viner
she
saw
that
the
envelope
and
paper
had
been
supplied
by
bigglesforth
of
craven
gardens
and
that
a
certain
letter
in
the
typewriter
which
had
been
used
was
defective
just
so
laughed
drillford
and
so
being
as
i
say
a
smart
woman
she
went
round
to
bigglesforth
got
him
to
herself
and
made
some
inquiries
and
it
very
queer
viner
how
some
of
these
apparently
intricate
cases
are
easily
solved
by
one
chance
discovery
she
been
talking
to
bigglesforth
ten
minutes
before
she
was
on
the
right
track
bigglesforth
when
he
got
to
know
the
main
features
of
the
case
was
willing
enough
to
help
and
your
aunt
immediately
brought
him
round
here
to
see
me
and
i
knew
at
once
that
we
got
right
there
yes
but
how
exactly
asked
viner
bigglesforth
answered
drillford
told
me
that
he
supplied
stationery
to
cortelyon
for
some
time
and
he
no
doubt
that
the
paper
and
envelope
described
by
miss
penkridge
was
some
which
specially
secured
for
the
doctor
but
he
told
something
far
more
important
six
months
ago
cortelyon
went
to
bigglesforth
and
asked
him
if
he
could
get
him
a
good
typewriter
now
bigglesforth
had
a
very
good
one
for
which
he
no
use
and
he
at
once
sold
it
to
cortelyon
bigglesforth
did
mention
the
matter
to
his
customer
for
the
machine
was
perfect
in
all
other
respects
but
one
of
the
letters
was
defective
broken
that
was
the
same
letter
viner
which
was
defective
in
the
document
which
cave
showed
to
you
gentlemen
and
spoke
of
previously
in
court
extraordinary
muttered
viner
what
a
piece
of
luck
no
sir
said
drillford
stoutly
no
luck
at
all
just
a
bit
of
good
thinking
on
the
part
of
a
shrewd
woman
but
you
want
to
know
what
we
did
i
was
so
absolutely
certain
of
the
truth
of
miss
penkridge
theory
that
i
immediately
made
preparations
for
a
descent
on
cortelyon
house
i
got
a
number
of
our
best
men
detectives
of
course
and
we
went
round
to
markendale
square
back
and
front
inquiry
showed
that
cortelyon
was
out
but
we
scarcely
got
that
fact
ascertained
when
he
drove
up
in
a
taxicab
with
cave
himself
they
hurriedly
entered
the
house
i
myself
was
watching
from
a
good
point
of
vantage
and
i
saw
that
both
men
were
to
say
the
least
anxious
and
excited
then
i
began
to
make
final
preparations
but
before
i
finished
telling
my
men
exactly
what
to
do
another
party
drove
up
your
companion
miss
wickham
killenhall
she
too
entered
then
i
moved
quick
some
of
us
went
to
the
front
i
with
the
others
went
in
by
the
back
we
made
straight
for
cortelyon
surgery
and
we
were
on
him
and
the
other
two
before
they
time
to
move
literally
the
two
men
certainly
tried
to
draw
revolvers
but
we
were
too
many
for
and
as
they
tried
that
game
i
had
handcuffed
there
and
then
it
was
all
an
affair
of
a
moment
and
of
course
they
saw
it
was
all
up
now
equally
of
course
viner
in
all
these
cases
in
my
experience
the
subordinates
immediately
try
to
save
their
own
skins
by
denouncing
the
principal
and
it
was
so
in
this
instance
killenhall
and
cave
at
once
denounced
cortelyon
as
the
mainspring
and
the
woman
who
a
regular
coward
got
me
aside
and
offered
to
turn
king
evidence
and
whispered
that
cortelyon
actually
killed
ashton
himself
unaided
as
he
let
him
out
of
his
back
door
into
lonsdale
passage
so
that
settled
exclaimed
viner
yes
i
think
so
agreed
drillford
well
we
brought
all
here
and
charged
and
examined
nothing
much
on
cave
who
of
course
is
precisely
what
hyde
said
he
was
a
man
named
nugent
starr
an
old
actor
if
he
was
as
good
a
performer
on
the
stage
as
he
is
in
private
life
he
ought
to
have
done
well
but
on
killenhall
we
found
ten
thousand
pounds
in
bank
of
england
notes
and
one
or
two
letters
from
cortelyon
which
she
was
a
fool
for
keeping
for
they
clearly
prove
that
she
was
an
accessory
and
on
cortelyon
we
a
big
find
that
diamond
that
ashton
used
to
carry
about
the
other
ring
that
ashton
was
wearing
when
he
was
murdered
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
certain
papers
which
he
no
doubt
taken
from
ashton
body
what
are
they
demanded
viner
drillford
glanced
at
miss
wickham
well
he
said
i
only
just
had
time
to
glance
at
them
but
i
should
say
that
they
affect
miss
wickham
in
a
very
surprising
fashion
and
i
shall
be
glad
to
hand
them
over
to
her
solicitors
as
soon
as
they
come
for
them
they
birth
certificates
burial
certificates
marriage
certificates
and
a
complete
memorandum
of
a
certain
case
evidently
written
out
with
great
care
by
ashton
himself
and
of
course
knowing
what
i
do
now
it
very
clear
to
me
how
ashton
murder
came
about
cortelyon
knew
that
if
ashton
was
out
of
the
way
and
he
himself
in
possession
of
the
papers
he
could
use
some
suppress
others
and
foist
off
an
accomplice
of
his
own
as
claimant
to
a
title
which
from
what
seen
appears
without
doubt
to
belong
to
drillford
was
again
glancing
at
miss
wickham
but
viner
contrived
to
stop
any
further
revelations
and
got
to
his
feet
extraordinary
he
said
but
my
aunt
where
is
she
she
remained
here
until
we
safely
caged
the
birds
answered
drillford
then
she
said
she
go
home
and
i
suppose
you
find
her
there
viner
took
his
companion
away
from
the
in
silence
but
at
the
end
of
the
street
miss
wickham
looked
back
are
those
three
people
really
locked
up
in
cells
close
by
where
we
were
sitting
with
the
inspector
she
asked
just
so
answered
viner
and
will
they
all
be
hanged
she
whispered
i
sincerely
hope
one
will
exclaimed
viner
what
she
inquired
did
the
inspector
mean
about
the
papers
found
on
cortelyon
i
have
some
uneasy
feeling
that
i
think
you
better
wait
said
viner
there
have
to
be
some
queer
explanations
we
must
let
pawle
and
carless
know
of
happened
they
the
proper
people
to
deal
with
this
affair
and
then
as
they
turned
into
markendale
square
they
saw
pawle
and
carless
who
with
lord
ellingham
were
hurrying
from
miss
house
in
the
direction
of
viner
carless
quickened
his
pace
and
came
toward
them
i
was
so
upset
when
i
heard
from
perkwite
that
miss
wickham
has
been
in
that
house
in
whitechapel
he
said
that
on
learning
she
gone
off
with
you
viner
lord
ellingham
and
i
drove
to
pawle
and
brought
him
on
here
to
learn
if
she
got
home
and
what
had
happened
what
had
happened
demanded
pawle
what
is
it
viner
viner
gathered
them
round
him
with
a
look
this
has
happened
he
said
the
whole
thing
solved
murderer
is
found
and
he
and
his
accomplices
are
under
lock
and
key
listen
and
i
tell
you
all
that
been
done
since
one
up
here
while
we
been
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
but
i
only
give
you
an
outline
well
then
the
three
men
listened
in
dead
silence
until
viner
had
repeated
drillford
story
then
pawle
glanced
round
at
the
window
of
viner
house
miss
penkridge
by
all
that
wonderful
he
said
in
a
deep
voice
most
extraordinary
where
is
she
at
home
i
should
imagine
answered
viner
with
a
laugh
then
my
dear
sir
by
all
means
let
us
pay
our
respects
to
her
said
pawle
a
tribute
by
all
means
exclaimed
carless
a
just
tribute
richly
deserved
i
should
like
to
add
my
small
quota
said
lord
ellingham
viner
led
the
way
into
his
house
and
to
the
miss
penkridge
in
her
best
cap
was
calmly
dispensing
tea
to
the
two
hyde
sisters
who
were
regarding
her
with
obvious
admiration
she
looked
round
on
her
nephew
and
the
flood
of
callers
as
if
to
ask
what
most
of
them
were
doing
there
and
viner
knowing
miss
penkridge
peculiar
humour
rose
to
the
occasion
my
dear
aunt
he
said
in
a
hushed
voice
these
gentlemen
having
heard
of
your
extraordinary
achievement
this
afternoon
have
come
to
lay
at
your
feet
their
united
tribute
of
miss
penkridge
shot
a
warning
glance
through
her
spectacles
do
talk
nonsense
richard
she
exclaimed
sharply
ring
the
bell
for
more
cups
and
saucers
chapter
xxix
who
is
to
tell
her
but
viner
instead
of
ordering
the
teacups
whispered
a
word
or
two
to
miss
penkridge
and
then
beckoned
lord
ellingham
and
the
two
solicitors
to
follow
him
out
of
the
room
he
silently
led
them
to
his
study
and
closed
the
door
miss
wickham
will
be
all
right
for
a
while
under
my
aunt
care
he
said
with
a
smile
that
had
a
certain
meaning
in
it
which
was
not
lost
on
pawle
or
on
carless
but
there
are
matters
connected
with
her
which
ought
not
to
wait
even
for
ten
minutes
hanging
round
miss
penkridge
now
i
have
been
thrown
headlong
into
this
case
and
like
all
the
rest
of
you
i
am
pretty
well
acquainted
with
it
and
i
take
it
that
now
that
the
murder
of
ashton
has
been
solved
the
real
question
is
what
is
the
truth
about
the
young
lady
who
was
certainly
his
ward
that
is
right
exclaimed
pawle
carless
and
lord
ellingham
i
am
sure
agree
with
me
absolutely
as
far
as
i
concerned
asserted
carless
his
lordship
will
speak
for
himself
lord
ellingham
answered
viner
smile
with
one
equally
frank
i
do
know
whether
i
lord
ellingham
or
not
he
said
i
have
had
considerable
doubt
on
that
point
ever
since
our
conference
the
other
day
but
i
will
say
this
gentlemen
i
had
some
conversation
with
miss
wickham
the
other
day
after
we
left
your
office
carless
when
she
was
kind
enough
to
allow
me
to
escort
her
home
and
well
to
be
frank
gentlemen
whether
she
is
my
cousin
or
not
i
to
me
an
phrase
desire
her
better
acquaintance
and
if
she
is
my
cousin
why
then
the
title
is
not
mine
but
hers
the
two
lawyers
exchanged
significant
glances
admirably
spoken
my
lord
said
pawle
excellent
it
is
just
what
i
would
have
expected
of
his
lordship
remarked
carless
i
have
known
his
lordship
since
he
was
first
breeched
but
i
believe
viner
has
something
to
say
yes
this
answered
viner
drillford
found
on
cortelyon
the
papers
which
are
missing
from
those
which
ashton
had
evidently
kept
together
with
a
view
to
proving
his
ward
right
to
the
title
and
estates
he
is
a
sharp
fellow
drillford
and
he
told
me
just
now
that
he
had
glanced
over
those
papers
since
cortelyon
arrest
and
he
well
i
only
just
stopped
him
from
letting
out
to
miss
wickham
who
if
the
papers
and
the
deduction
to
be
drawn
from
them
are
correct
she
really
is
i
am
right
in
supposing
he
continued
suddenly
interrupting
himself
that
the
ellingham
title
runs
in
the
female
as
in
the
male
line
quite
right
viner
said
carless
quite
right
it
does
i
believe
i
mentioned
the
other
day
that
there
has
already
been
one
countess
of
ellingham
in
her
own
right
the
male
line
came
to
an
end
at
one
period
the
daughter
of
the
last
male
holder
succeeded
and
the
man
whom
she
married
took
the
family
name
of
and
their
eldest
son
of
course
succeeded
on
the
death
of
his
mother
quite
right
sir
then
suggested
viner
do
you
think
it
would
be
advisable
rather
than
that
lord
ellingham
should
be
kept
in
suspense
that
we
should
go
round
to
the
and
inspect
the
documents
i
do
know
whether
drillford
will
give
them
up
until
his
prisoners
have
been
brought
before
the
magistrate
but
he
said
he
would
give
them
to
the
proper
persons
eventually
and
in
any
case
he
will
show
them
to
you
three
gentlemen
good
said
pawle
let
us
go
at
once
it
is
only
a
few
minutes
walk
and
in
the
meantime
suggested
carless
miss
wickham
might
be
asked
to
remain
here
under
the
wing
of
the
excellent
miss
penkridge
viner
laughingly
remarked
that
he
had
no
doubt
whatever
that
miss
penkridge
would
willingly
assume
this
position
of
trust
and
leading
his
callers
into
the
hall
left
them
for
a
moment
while
he
returned
to
the
he
was
smiling
when
he
returned
i
think
miss
wickham
will
be
safe
for
some
time
he
said
horrified
as
she
is
at
the
conduct
of
the
wicked
killenhall
she
is
sufficiently
feminine
to
be
taking
a
vast
interest
in
my
aunt
account
of
how
she
brought
off
her
wonderful
stroke
of
genius
this
afternoon
so
shall
we
go
round
drillford
found
alone
in
his
office
showed
no
surprise
when
viner
brought
in
and
introduced
his
companions
he
already
knew
the
two
lawyers
and
exchanged
comprehending
words
with
them
but
he
looked
at
lord
ellingham
with
the
same
interest
which
viner
had
seen
in
him
when
miss
wickham
was
present
of
course
you
may
see
the
whole
lot
gentlemen
he
said
as
he
unlocked
the
drawer
i
do
want
you
to
take
these
things
away
now
though
because
we
like
to
produce
them
when
these
people
are
brought
up
tomorrow
morning
but
after
they
been
shown
i
hand
them
over
and
in
the
meantime
you
can
rely
on
it
that
they
be
taken
care
of
rather
well
now
here
the
missing
ring
hyde
you
know
admitted
to
picking
up
one
this
is
the
other
without
doubt
and
there
the
diamond
of
course
cortelyon
robbed
ashton
after
he
killed
him
as
a
piece
of
bluff
what
he
wanted
was
these
papers
he
evidently
gave
cave
or
starr
his
accomplice
certain
of
the
papers
to
play
the
game
with
but
the
really
important
ones
he
kept
in
his
own
pocket
where
i
found
there
you
are
gentlemen
he
handed
over
a
stout
foolscap
envelope
to
carless
and
that
gentleman
whose
fingers
trembled
a
little
in
spite
of
his
determined
attempt
to
preserve
his
professional
coolness
drew
certain
papers
from
it
and
laying
them
on
a
desk
close
by
beckoned
the
other
men
to
his
elbows
and
began
to
examine
them
for
several
minutes
the
four
pairs
of
eyes
ran
over
the
various
documents
carless
finger
pointing
to
one
particular
passage
or
another
during
their
hasty
perusal
and
he
and
pawle
nodding
assent
as
they
exchanged
glances
and
muttered
remarks
not
a
doubt
of
it
exclaimed
carless
suddenly
not
one
doubt
observe
the
extraordinary
care
which
the
missing
lord
marketstoke
took
to
safeguard
his
own
interests
and
those
of
his
daughter
in
case
he
ever
wished
to
revive
his
claims
here
for
instance
is
his
marriage
certificate
you
see
he
took
good
care
to
be
married
in
his
own
real
proper
legal
name
here
again
is
the
birth
certificate
of
his
daughter
you
see
how
she
is
described
avice
wickham
daughter
of
et
cetera
et
cetera
and
here
is
his
death
certificate
that
too
is
all
in
order
you
see
all
these
are
duly
attested
copies
we
could
of
course
insist
on
having
them
verified
over
there
but
i
no
doubt
about
their
genuineness
what
do
you
say
pawle
i
should
say
there
no
doubt
whatever
answered
pawle
readily
but
now
this
memorandum
evidently
written
by
ashton
himself
in
london
soon
after
he
got
here
carless
ran
his
eye
over
the
document
which
pawle
indicated
aye
he
said
a
most
important
most
valuable
piece
of
evidence
you
see
that
cortelyon
name
is
mentioned
in
it
what
he
say
only
man
besides
myself
who
is
in
full
possession
of
the
gad
hang
this
scoundrel
yes
here
it
is
the
full
history
of
the
case
very
lucidly
summarized
he
must
have
been
a
very
good
business
man
this
unfortunate
ashton
poor
fellow
but
what
this
he
put
at
the
end
as
a
sort
of
note
arriving
in
england
and
making
inquiries
in
london
and
about
marketstoke
and
ellingham
as
to
the
character
and
abilities
of
the
young
man
who
is
the
present
holder
of
the
title
and
estates
which
are
by
right
my
ward
i
have
had
considerable
doubt
as
to
whether
or
not
i
should
exercise
the
discretion
extended
to
me
by
her
father
having
nobody
of
my
own
i
have
left
her
all
my
fortune
which
is
a
handsome
one
and
she
will
be
a
rich
woman
the
young
man
seems
to
be
an
estimable
and
promising
young
fellow
and
i
am
much
exercised
in
mind
as
to
whether
it
might
not
be
best
if
cortelyon
and
i
kept
the
secret
to
ourselves
until
our
deaths
carless
read
this
passage
aloud
and
then
smote
the
desk
heavily
with
his
hand
there
the
secret
of
the
murder
he
exclaimed
you
see
gentlemen
ashton
one
holder
of
the
secret
was
honest
the
other
cortelyon
was
a
rogue
ashton
wanted
nothing
for
himself
cortelyon
wanted
to
profit
cortelyon
saw
that
by
killing
ashton
he
alone
would
have
the
secret
he
evidently
got
two
accomplices
who
were
necessary
to
him
and
he
meant
by
suppressing
certain
facts
and
enlarging
on
others
to
palm
off
an
impostor
who
mark
this
could
be
squared
by
one
hundred
thousand
pounds
oh
a
bad
fellow
keep
him
tight
mr
inspector
keep
him
tight
you
need
bother
yourself
carless
answered
drillford
laconically
we
see
to
that
carless
again
cast
an
eye
on
the
passage
he
had
just
read
and
then
touching
lord
ellingham
arm
drew
his
attention
to
it
again
whispering
something
in
his
ear
at
which
the
young
man
cheek
reddened
then
he
gathered
up
the
papers
carefully
replaced
them
in
their
envelope
and
handed
them
to
drillford
much
obliged
to
you
he
said
now
at
what
time
are
these
miscreants
to
be
put
in
the
dock
tomorrow
ten
sharp
then
he
declared
with
a
shrewd
glance
i
shall
be
there
and
in
all
my
experience
i
shall
never
have
set
eyes
on
a
worse
scoundrel
than
the
chief
one
of
now
gentlemen
shall
we
go
outside
carless
took
lord
ellingham
arm
you
know
what
this
really
means
to
you
he
said
lord
ellingham
laughed
of
course
he
answered
remember
continued
carless
with
a
knowing
glance
at
pawle
you
need
give
in
without
a
struggle
you
can
make
a
big
fight
in
possession
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
turn
you
out
you
can
have
litigation
as
much
as
ever
you
wish
but
i
do
think
there
the
least
doubt
that
the
young
woman
we
going
back
to
is
your
cousin
and
therefore
countess
of
ellingham
neither
do
i
said
his
client
with
a
smile
nor
i
think
does
mr
pawle
not
a
doubt
of
it
affirmed
pawle
very
well
said
carless
and
pulled
his
companions
to
a
halt
then
the
question
now
is
who
is
to
tell
her
the
two
lawyers
and
viner
looked
from
one
another
to
lord
ellingham
but
lord
ellingham
was
already
eager
and
responsive
gentlemen
he
said
quickly
i
claim
that
right
if
i
am
to
abdicate
in
favour
of
another
let
me
have
at
any
rate
the
privilege
of
first
greeting
the
new
sovereign
besides
as
i
have
already
said
to
you
carless
interrupted
him
by
pointing
toward
viner
house
of
which
they
were
now
in
sight
i
dare
say
our
friend
viner
who
has
as
he
says
been
strangely
mixed
up
in
this
strange
affair
can
manage
matters
he
said
dryly
and
as
things
are
nothing
could
be
better
viner
took
his
companions
back
into
his
library
and
opening
a
door
showed
lord
ellingham
a
small
study
which
lay
beyond
i
bring
miss
wickham
to
you
at
once
he
said
then
with
a
glance
at
the
two
lawyers
which
went
round
again
to
lord
ellingham
he
added
quietly
when
you
have
told
her
you
let
us
know
what
she
says
aye
aye
muttered
pawle
good
we
must
know
that
viner
went
away
to
the
and
presently
brought
miss
wickham
back
with
him
she
looked
from
one
solicitor
to
the
other
with
something
of
a
smile
more
mystery
she
asked
carless
with
a
courtly
bow
took
the
girl
hand
my
dear
young
lady
he
said
there
is
this
time
a
mystery
to
be
explained
and
allow
me
to
hand
you
into
this
room
there
is
a
young
gentleman
in
here
who
will
explain
it
all
of
it
a
thousand
times
better
than
we
old
fogies
possibly
could
he
closed
the
door
on
her
and
turned
to
pawle
i
trouble
you
for
a
pinch
of
that
old
snuff
of
yours
pawle
he
said
um
dear
me
what
extraordinary
moments
we
do
pass
through
viner
my
dear
fellow
you
a
i
know
to
er
pass
the
time
show
me
some
of
your
treasures
ten
minutes
twenty
minutes
thirty
minutes
went
by
while
viner
showed
some
of
his
most
treasured
possessions
in
the
way
of
print
and
binding
to
the
two
old
lawyers
they
were
both
past
masters
in
the
art
of
and
they
contrived
to
show
great
interest
in
what
was
exhibited
to
them
but
viner
knew
very
well
that
when
pawle
was
expatiating
on
the
merits
of
an
elzevir
or
carless
on
the
beauties
of
a
grolier
they
were
really
wondering
what
the
two
young
people
in
the
next
room
so
strangely
thrown
together
were
saying
to
each
other
and
then
as
he
was
about
to
unlock
a
cabinet
and
bring
out
a
collection
of
autograph
letters
the
door
of
the
inner
room
was
opened
and
the
two
appeared
on
the
threshold
one
looking
extremely
confident
and
the
other
full
of
blushes
and
surprise
and
they
were
holding
each
other
hands
gentlemen
our
very
good
friends
said
lord
ellingham
it
is
only
right
that
we
should
take
you
into
our
confidence
at
once
there
will
be
no
litigation
carless
no
difficulties
pawle
i
absolutely
insist
on
resigning
what
is
not
mine
to
my
cousin
the
countess
of
ellingham
and
not
in
any
return
gentlemen
she
has
promised
to
give
me
something
which
i
shall
prize
far
more
than
any
title
or
any
estate
you
understand
and
now
if
viner
will
excuse
me
there
are
just
a
few
more
things
we
have
to
say
to
each
other
and
then
he
drew
the
girl
back
into
the
room
and
closed
the
door
and
the
three
men
once
more
left
to
themselves
solemnly
shook
hands
with
each
other
heaving
sighs
of
infinite
delight
and
gratification
the
end
