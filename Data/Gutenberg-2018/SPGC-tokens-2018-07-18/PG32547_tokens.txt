preface
the
present
volume
is
an
attempt
to
carry
out
a
plan
which
william
james
is
known
to
have
formed
several
years
before
his
death
in
he
collected
reprints
in
an
envelope
which
he
inscribed
with
the
title
in
radical
empiricism
and
he
also
had
duplicate
sets
of
these
reprints
bound
under
the
same
title
and
deposited
for
the
use
of
students
in
the
general
harvard
library
and
in
the
philosophical
library
in
emerson
hall
two
years
later
professor
james
published
meaning
of
and
pluralistic
and
inserted
in
these
volumes
several
of
the
articles
which
he
had
intended
to
use
in
the
in
radical
empiricism
whether
he
would
nevertheless
have
carried
out
his
original
plan
had
he
lived
can
not
be
certainly
known
several
facts
however
stand
out
very
clearly
in
the
first
place
the
articles
included
in
the
original
plan
but
omitted
from
his
later
volumes
are
indispensable
to
the
understanding
of
his
other
writings
to
these
articles
he
repeatedly
alludes
thus
in
meaning
of
he
says
this
statement
is
probably
excessively
obscure
to
any
one
who
has
not
read
my
two
articles
consciousness
exist
and
world
of
pure
experience
other
allusions
have
been
indicated
in
the
present
text
in
the
second
place
the
articles
originally
brought
together
as
in
radical
empiricism
form
a
connected
whole
not
only
were
most
of
them
written
consecutively
within
a
period
of
two
years
but
they
contain
numerous
in
the
third
place
professor
james
regarded
empiricism
as
an
doctrine
this
he
asserted
expressly
let
me
say
that
there
is
no
logical
connexion
between
pragmatism
as
i
understand
it
and
a
doctrine
which
i
have
recently
set
forth
as
empiricism
the
latter
stands
on
its
own
feet
one
may
entirely
reject
it
and
still
be
a
pragmatist
preface
p
ix
finally
professor
james
came
toward
the
end
of
his
life
to
regard
empiricism
as
more
fundamental
and
more
important
than
in
the
preface
to
meaning
of
the
author
gives
the
following
explanation
of
his
desire
to
continue
and
if
possible
conclude
the
controversy
over
pragmatism
i
am
interested
in
another
doctrine
in
philosophy
to
which
i
give
the
name
of
radical
empiricism
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
establishment
of
the
pragmatist
theory
of
truth
is
a
step
of
importance
in
making
radical
empiricism
prevail
xii
in
preparing
the
present
volume
the
editor
has
therefore
been
governed
by
two
motives
on
the
one
hand
he
has
sought
to
preserve
and
make
accessible
certain
important
articles
not
to
be
found
in
professor
james
other
books
this
is
true
of
essays
i
ii
iv
v
viii
ix
x
xi
and
xii
on
the
other
hand
he
has
sought
to
bring
together
in
one
volume
a
set
of
essays
treating
systematically
of
one
independent
coherent
and
fundamental
doctrine
to
this
end
it
has
seemed
best
to
include
three
essays
iii
vi
and
vii
which
although
included
in
the
original
plan
were
afterwards
reprinted
elsewhere
and
one
essay
xii
not
included
in
the
original
plan
essays
iii
vi
and
vii
are
indispensable
to
the
consecutiveness
of
the
series
and
are
so
interwoven
with
the
rest
that
it
is
necessary
that
the
student
should
have
them
at
hand
for
ready
consultation
essay
xii
throws
an
important
light
on
the
author
general
and
forms
an
important
link
between
empiricism
and
the
author
other
doctrines
in
short
the
present
volume
is
designed
not
as
a
collection
but
rather
as
a
treatise
it
is
intended
that
another
volume
shall
be
issued
which
shall
contain
papers
having
biographical
or
historical
importance
which
have
not
yet
been
reprinted
in
book
form
the
present
volume
is
intended
not
only
for
students
of
professor
james
philosophy
but
for
students
of
metaphysics
and
the
theory
of
knowledge
it
sets
forth
systematically
and
within
brief
compass
the
doctrine
of
empiricism
a
word
more
may
be
in
order
concerning
the
general
meaning
of
this
doctrine
in
the
preface
to
the
to
professor
james
gives
the
name
to
his
philosophic
attitude
and
adds
the
following
explanation
i
say
because
it
is
contented
to
regard
its
most
assured
conclusions
concerning
matters
of
fact
as
hypotheses
liable
to
modification
in
the
course
of
future
experience
and
i
say
because
it
treats
the
doctrine
of
monism
itself
as
an
hypothesis
and
unlike
so
much
of
the
halfway
empiricism
that
is
current
under
the
name
of
positivism
or
agnosticism
or
scientific
naturalism
it
does
not
dogmatically
affirm
monism
as
something
with
which
all
experience
has
got
to
square
pp
an
of
this
description
is
a
philosophic
attitude
or
temper
of
mind
rather
than
a
doctrine
and
characterizes
all
of
professor
james
writings
it
is
set
forth
in
essay
xii
of
the
present
volume
in
a
narrower
sense
is
the
method
of
resorting
to
for
the
solution
of
philosophical
problems
rationalists
are
the
men
of
principles
empiricists
the
men
of
facts
problems
of
cf
also
and
pp
or
since
principles
are
universals
and
facts
are
particulars
perhaps
the
best
way
of
characterizing
the
two
tendencies
is
to
say
that
rationalist
thinking
proceeds
most
willingly
by
going
from
wholes
to
parts
while
empiricist
thinking
proceeds
by
going
from
parts
to
wholes
problems
of
cf
also
and
pluralistic
p
again
empiricism
remands
us
to
sensation
p
the
empiricist
view
insists
that
as
reality
is
created
temporally
day
by
day
concepts
can
never
fitly
supersede
perception
the
deeper
features
of
reality
are
found
only
in
perceptual
experience
problems
of
pp
empiricism
in
this
sense
is
as
yet
characteristic
of
professor
james
philosophy
a
it
is
not
the
distinctive
and
independent
doctrine
set
forth
in
the
present
book
the
only
summary
of
empiricism
in
this
last
and
narrowest
sense
appears
in
the
preface
to
meaning
of
pp
and
it
must
be
reprinted
here
as
the
key
to
the
text
that
follows
radical
empiricism
consists
first
of
a
postulate
next
of
a
statement
of
fact
and
finally
of
a
generalized
conclusion
the
postulate
is
that
only
things
that
shall
be
debatable
among
philosophers
shall
be
things
definable
in
terms
drawn
from
things
of
an
unexperienceable
nature
may
exist
ad
libitum
but
they
form
no
part
of
the
material
for
philosophic
debate
this
is
the
principle
of
pure
experience
as
a
methodical
postulate
cf
below
pp
this
postulate
corresponds
to
the
notion
which
the
author
repeatedly
attributes
to
shadworth
hodgson
the
notion
that
realities
are
only
what
they
are
as
of
religious
meaning
of
pp
in
this
sense
empiricism
and
pragmatism
are
closely
allied
indeed
if
pragmatism
be
defined
as
the
assertion
that
the
meaning
of
any
proposition
can
always
be
brought
down
to
some
particular
consequence
in
our
future
practical
experience
the
point
lying
in
the
fact
that
the
experience
must
be
particular
rather
than
in
the
fact
that
it
must
be
active
of
then
pragmatism
and
the
above
postulate
come
to
the
same
thing
the
present
book
however
consists
not
so
much
in
the
assertion
of
this
postulate
as
in
the
of
it
and
the
method
is
successful
in
special
applications
by
virtue
of
a
certain
statement
of
fact
concerning
relations
the
statement
of
fact
is
that
relations
between
things
conjunctive
as
well
as
disjunctive
are
just
as
much
matters
of
direct
particular
experience
neither
more
so
nor
less
so
than
the
things
cf
also
pluralistic
will
to
p
this
is
the
central
doctrine
of
the
present
book
it
distinguishes
empiricism
from
the
ordinary
empiricism
of
hume
mill
with
which
it
is
otherwise
allied
cf
below
pp
it
provides
an
empirical
and
relational
version
of
and
so
distinguishes
the
author
voluntarism
from
a
view
with
which
it
is
easily
confused
the
view
which
upholds
a
pure
or
transcendent
activity
cf
below
essay
vi
it
makes
it
possible
to
escape
the
vicious
disjunctions
that
have
thus
far
baffled
philosophy
such
disjunctions
as
those
between
consciousness
and
physical
nature
between
thought
and
its
object
between
one
mind
and
another
and
between
one
and
another
these
disjunctions
need
not
be
by
calling
in
any
extraneous
connective
support
of
preface
xiii
they
may
now
be
by
regarding
the
dualities
in
question
as
only
of
empirical
relationship
among
common
empirical
the
pragmatistic
account
of
and
shows
only
how
a
vicious
disjunction
between
and
may
thus
be
avoided
the
present
volume
not
only
presents
pragmatism
in
this
light
but
adds
similar
accounts
of
the
other
dualities
mentioned
above
thus
while
pragmatism
and
radical
empiricism
do
not
differ
essentially
when
regarded
as
they
are
independent
when
regarded
as
doctrines
for
it
would
be
possible
to
hold
the
pragmatistic
theory
of
and
without
basing
it
on
any
fundamental
theory
of
relations
and
without
extending
such
a
theory
of
relations
to
residual
philosophical
problems
without
in
short
holding
either
to
the
above
of
fact
or
to
the
following
conclusion
the
generalized
conclusion
is
that
therefore
parts
of
experience
hold
together
from
next
to
next
by
relations
that
are
themselves
parts
of
experience
the
directly
apprehended
universe
needs
in
short
no
extraneous
connective
support
but
possesses
in
its
own
right
a
concatenated
or
continuous
when
thus
generalized
empiricism
is
not
only
a
theory
of
knowledge
comprising
pragmatism
as
a
special
chapter
but
a
metaphysic
as
well
it
excludes
the
hypothesis
of
reality
cf
below
it
is
the
author
most
rigorous
statement
of
his
theory
that
reality
is
an
of
pluralistic
lect
v
vii
it
is
that
positive
and
constructive
of
which
professor
james
said
let
empiricism
once
become
associated
with
religion
as
hitherto
through
some
strange
misunderstanding
it
has
been
associated
with
irreligion
and
i
believe
that
a
new
era
of
religion
as
well
as
of
philosophy
will
be
ready
to
begin

on
the

varied
in

in
her
explanations
of

and
may
be
expected
to
vary
in
the
future
at
first
and
matter
and
body
stood
for
a
pair
of
equipollent
substances
quite
on
a
par
in
weight
and
interest
but
one
day
kant
undermined
the
soul
and
brought
in
the
transcendental
ego
and
ever
since
then
the
bipolar
relation
has
been
very
much
off
its
balance
the
transcendental
ego
seems
nowadays
in
rationalist
quarters
to
stand
for
everything
in
empiricist
quarters
for
almost
nothing
in
the
hands
of
such
writers
as
schuppe
rehmke
natorp
münsterberg
at
any
rate
in
his
earlier
writings
and
others
the
spiritual
principle
attenuates
itself
to
a
thoroughly
ghostly
condition
being
only
a
name
for
the
fact
that
the
of
experience
it
loses
personal
form
and
activity
these
passing
over
to
the
content
and
becomes
a
bare
or
of
which
in
its
own
right
absolutely
nothing
can
be
said
i
believe
that
when
once
it
has
evaporated
to
this
estate
of
pure
diaphaneity
is
on
the
point
of
disappearing
altogether
it
is
the
name
of
a
nonentity
and
has
no
right
to
a
place
among
first
principles
those
who
still
cling
to
it
are
clinging
to
a
mere
echo
the
faint
rumor
left
behind
by
the
disappearing
upon
the
air
of
philosophy
during
the
past
year
i
have
read
a
number
of
articles
whose
authors
seemed
just
on
the
point
of
abandoning
the
notion
of
consciousness
and
substituting
for
it
that
of
an
absolute
experience
not
due
to
two
factors
but
they
were
not
quite
radical
enough
not
quite
daring
enough
in
their
negations
for
twenty
years
past
i
have
mistrusted
as
an
entity
for
seven
or
eight
years
past
i
have
suggested
its
to
my
students
and
tried
to
give
them
its
pragmatic
equivalent
in
realities
of
experience
it
seems
to
me
that
the
hour
is
ripe
for
it
to
be
openly
and
universally
discarded
to
deny
plumply
that
exists
seems
so
absurd
on
the
face
of
it
for
undeniably
do
exist
that
i
fear
some
readers
will
follow
me
no
farther
let
me
then
immediately
explain
that
i
mean
only
to
deny
that
the
word
stands
for
an
entity
but
to
insist
most
emphatically
that
it
does
stand
for
a
function
there
is
i
mean
no
aboriginal
stuff
or
quality
of
being
contrasted
with
that
of
which
material
objects
are
made
out
of
which
our
thoughts
of
them
are
made
but
there
is
a
function
in
experience
which
thoughts
perform
and
for
the
performance
of
which
this
quality
of
being
is
invoked
that
function
is
is
supposed
necessary
to
explain
the
fact
that
things
not
only
are
but
get
reported
are
known
whoever
blots
out
the
notion
of
consciousness
from
his
list
of
first
principles
must
still
provide
in
some
way
for
that
function
being
carried
on
i
my
thesis
is
that
if
we
start
with
the
supposition
that
there
is
only
one
primal
stuff
or
material
in
the
world
a
stuff
of
which
everything
is
composed
and
if
we
call
that
stuff
experience
then
knowing
can
easily
be
explained
as
a
particular
sort
of
relation
towards
one
another
into
which
portions
of
pure
experience
may
enter
the
relation
itself
is
a
part
of
pure
experience
one
of
its
becomes
the
subject
or
bearer
of
the
knowledge
the
knower
the
other
becomes
the
object
known
this
will
need
much
explanation
before
it
can
be
understood
the
best
way
to
get
it
understood
is
to
contrast
it
with
the
alternative
view
and
for
that
we
may
take
the
recentest
alternative
that
in
which
the
evaporation
of
the
definite
has
proceeded
as
far
as
it
can
go
without
being
yet
complete
if
has
expelled
earlier
forms
of
dualism
we
shall
have
expelled
all
forms
if
we
are
able
to
expel
in
its
turn
for
the
thinkers
i
call
the
word
consciousness
does
no
more
than
signalize
the
fact
that
experience
is
indefeasibly
dualistic
in
structure
it
means
that
not
subject
not
object
but
is
the
minimum
that
can
actually
be
the
distinction
meanwhile
is
entirely
different
from
that
between
mind
and
matter
from
that
between
body
and
soul
souls
were
detachable
had
separate
destinies
things
could
happen
to
them
to
consciousness
as
such
nothing
can
happen
for
timeless
itself
it
is
only
a
witness
of
happenings
in
time
in
which
it
plays
no
part
it
is
in
a
word
but
the
logical
correlative
of
in
an
experience
of
which
the
peculiarity
is
that
comes
to
in
it
that
of
takes
place
consciousness
as
such
is
entirely
impersonal
and
its
activities
belong
to
the
content
to
say
that
i
am
or
conscious
of
putting
forth
volition
means
only
that
certain
contents
for
which
and
of
will
are
the
names
are
not
without
witness
as
they
occur
thus
for
these
belated
drinkers
at
the
kantian
spring
we
should
have
to
admit
consciousness
as
an
necessity
even
if
we
had
no
direct
evidence
of
its
being
there
but
in
addition
to
this
we
are
supposed
by
almost
every
one
to
have
an
immediate
consciousness
of
consciousness
itself
when
the
world
of
outer
fact
ceases
to
be
materially
present
and
we
merely
recall
it
in
memory
or
fancy
it
the
consciousness
is
believed
to
stand
out
and
to
be
felt
as
a
kind
of
impalpable
inner
flowing
which
once
known
in
this
sort
of
experience
may
equally
be
detected
in
presentations
of
the
outer
world
the
moment
we
try
to
fix
our
attention
upon
consciousness
and
to
see
distinctly
it
is
says
a
recent
writer
it
seems
to
vanish
it
seems
as
if
we
had
before
us
a
mere
emptiness
when
we
try
to
introspect
the
sensation
of
blue
all
we
can
see
is
the
blue
the
other
element
is
as
if
it
were
diaphanous
yet
it
be
distinguished
if
we
look
attentively
enough
and
know
that
there
is
something
to
look
for
consciousness
bewusstheit
says
another
philosopher
is
inexplicable
and
hardly
describable
yet
all
conscious
experiences
have
this
in
common
that
what
we
call
their
content
has
this
peculiar
reference
to
a
centre
for
which
is
the
name
in
virtue
of
which
reference
alone
the
content
is
subjectively
given
or
appears
while
in
this
way
consciousness
or
reference
to
a
self
is
the
only
thing
which
distinguishes
a
conscious
content
from
any
sort
of
being
that
might
be
there
with
no
one
conscious
of
it
yet
this
only
ground
of
the
distinction
defies
all
closer
explanations
the
existence
of
consciousness
although
it
is
the
fundamental
fact
of
psychology
can
indeed
be
laid
down
as
certain
can
be
brought
out
by
analysis
but
can
neither
be
defined
nor
deduced
from
anything
but
itself
be
brought
out
by
analysis
this
author
says
this
supposes
that
the
consciousness
is
one
element
moment
factor
call
it
what
you
like
of
an
experience
of
essentially
dualistic
inner
constitution
from
which
if
you
abstract
the
content
the
consciousness
will
remain
revealed
to
its
own
eye
experience
at
this
rate
would
be
much
like
a
paint
of
which
the
world
pictures
were
made
paint
has
a
dual
constitution
involving
as
it
does
a
menstruum
oil
size
or
what
not
and
a
mass
of
content
in
the
form
of
pigment
suspended
therein
we
can
get
the
pure
menstruum
by
letting
the
pigment
settle
and
the
pure
pigment
by
pouring
off
the
size
or
oil
we
operate
here
by
physical
subtraction
and
the
usual
view
is
that
by
mental
subtraction
we
can
separate
the
two
factors
of
experience
in
an
analogous
way
not
isolating
them
entirely
but
distinguishing
them
enough
to
know
that
they
are
two
ii
now
my
contention
is
exactly
the
reverse
of
this
i
believe
has
no
such
inner
duplicity
and
the
separation
of
it
into
consciousness
and
content
comes
not
by
way
of
subtraction
but
by
way
of
the
addition
to
a
given
concrete
piece
of
it
of
other
sets
of
experiences
in
connection
with
which
severally
its
use
or
function
may
be
of
two
different
kinds
the
paint
will
also
serve
here
as
an
illustration
in
a
pot
in
a
along
with
other
paints
it
serves
in
its
entirety
as
so
much
saleable
matter
spread
on
a
canvas
with
other
paints
around
it
it
represents
on
the
contrary
a
feature
in
a
picture
and
performs
a
spiritual
function
just
so
i
maintain
does
a
given
undivided
portion
of
experience
taken
in
one
context
of
associates
play
the
part
of
a
knower
of
a
state
of
mind
of
while
in
a
different
context
the
same
undivided
bit
of
experience
plays
the
part
of
a
thing
known
of
an
objective
in
a
word
in
one
group
it
figures
as
a
thought
in
another
group
as
a
thing
and
since
it
can
figure
in
both
groups
simultaneously
we
have
every
right
to
speak
of
it
as
subjective
and
objective
both
at
once
the
dualism
connoted
by
such
terms
as
terms
which
in
philosophy
at
any
rate
tend
more
and
more
to
replace
the
terms
of
and
that
dualism
i
say
is
still
preserved
in
this
account
but
reinterpreted
so
that
instead
of
being
mysterious
and
elusive
it
becomes
verifiable
and
concrete
it
is
an
affair
of
relations
it
falls
outside
not
inside
the
single
experience
considered
and
can
always
be
particularized
and
defined
the
entering
wedge
for
this
more
concrete
way
of
understanding
the
dualism
was
fashioned
by
locke
when
he
made
the
word
stand
indifferently
for
thing
and
thought
and
by
berkeley
when
he
said
that
what
common
sense
means
by
realities
is
exactly
what
the
philosopher
means
by
ideas
neither
locke
nor
berkeley
thought
his
truth
out
into
perfect
clearness
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
conception
i
am
defending
does
little
more
than
consistently
carry
out
the
method
which
they
were
the
first
to
use
if
the
reader
will
take
his
own
experiences
he
will
see
what
i
mean
let
him
begin
with
a
perceptual
experience
the
so
called
of
a
physical
object
his
actual
field
of
vision
the
room
he
sits
in
with
the
book
he
is
reading
as
its
centre
and
let
him
for
the
present
treat
this
complex
object
in
the
way
as
being
what
it
seems
to
be
namely
a
collection
of
physical
things
cut
out
from
an
environing
world
of
other
physical
things
with
which
these
physical
things
have
actual
or
potential
relations
now
at
the
same
time
it
is
just
which
his
mind
as
we
say
perceives
and
the
whole
philosophy
of
perception
from
democritus
time
downwards
has
been
just
one
long
wrangle
over
the
paradox
that
what
is
evidently
one
reality
should
be
in
two
places
at
once
both
in
outer
space
and
in
a
person
mind
theories
of
perception
avoid
the
logical
paradox
but
on
the
other
hand
they
violate
the
reader
sense
of
life
which
knows
no
intervening
mental
image
but
seems
to
see
the
room
and
the
book
immediately
just
as
they
physically
exist
the
puzzle
of
how
the
one
identical
room
can
be
in
two
places
is
at
bottom
just
the
puzzle
of
how
one
identical
point
can
be
on
two
lines
it
can
if
it
be
situated
at
their
intersection
and
similarly
if
the
experience
of
the
room
were
a
place
of
intersection
of
two
processes
which
connected
it
with
different
groups
of
associates
respectively
it
could
be
counted
twice
over
as
belonging
to
either
group
and
spoken
of
loosely
as
existing
in
two
places
although
it
would
remain
all
the
time
a
numerically
single
thing
well
the
experience
is
a
member
of
diverse
processes
that
can
be
followed
away
from
it
along
entirely
different
lines
the
one
thing
has
so
many
relations
to
the
rest
of
experience
that
you
can
take
it
in
disparate
systems
of
association
and
treat
it
as
belonging
with
opposite
contexts
in
one
of
these
contexts
it
is
your
of
consciousness
in
another
it
is
room
in
which
you
sit
and
it
enters
both
contexts
in
its
wholeness
giving
no
pretext
for
being
said
to
attach
itself
to
consciousness
by
one
of
its
parts
or
aspects
and
to
outer
reality
by
another
what
are
the
two
processes
now
into
which
the
simultaneously
enters
in
this
way
one
of
them
is
the
reader
personal
biography
the
other
is
the
history
of
the
house
of
which
the
room
is
part
the
presentation
the
experience
the
in
short
for
until
we
have
decided
it
is
it
must
be
a
mere
is
the
last
term
of
a
train
of
sensations
emotions
decisions
movements
classifications
expectations
ending
in
the
present
and
the
first
term
of
a
series
of
similar
operations
extending
into
the
future
on
the
reader
part
on
the
other
hand
the
very
same
is
the
ad
of
a
lot
of
previous
physical
operations
carpentering
papering
furnishing
warming
and
the
a
of
a
lot
of
future
ones
in
which
it
will
be
concerned
when
undergoing
the
destiny
of
a
physical
room
the
physical
and
the
mental
operations
form
curiously
incompatible
groups
as
a
room
the
experience
has
occupied
that
spot
and
had
that
environment
for
thirty
years
as
your
field
of
consciousness
it
may
never
have
existed
until
now
as
a
room
attention
will
go
on
to
discover
endless
new
details
in
it
as
your
mental
state
merely
few
new
ones
will
emerge
under
attention
eye
as
a
room
it
will
take
an
earthquake
or
a
gang
of
men
and
in
any
case
a
certain
amount
of
time
to
destroy
it
as
your
subjective
state
the
closing
of
your
eyes
or
any
instantaneous
play
of
your
fancy
will
suffice
in
the
real
world
fire
will
consume
it
in
your
mind
you
can
let
fire
play
over
it
without
effect
as
an
outer
object
you
must
pay
so
much
a
month
to
inhabit
it
as
an
inner
content
you
may
occupy
it
for
any
length
of
time
if
in
short
you
follow
it
in
the
mental
direction
taking
it
along
with
events
of
personal
biography
solely
all
sorts
of
things
are
true
of
it
which
are
false
and
false
of
it
which
are
true
if
you
treat
it
as
a
real
thing
experienced
follow
it
in
the
physical
direction
and
relate
it
to
associates
in
the
outer
world
iii
so
far
all
seems
plain
sailing
but
my
thesis
will
probably
grow
less
plausible
to
the
reader
when
i
pass
from
percepts
to
concepts
or
from
the
case
of
things
presented
to
that
of
things
remote
i
believe
nevertheless
that
here
also
the
same
law
holds
good
if
we
take
conceptual
manifolds
or
memories
or
fancies
they
also
are
in
their
first
intention
mere
bits
of
pure
experience
and
as
such
are
single
which
act
in
one
context
as
objects
and
in
another
context
figure
as
mental
states
by
taking
them
in
their
first
intention
i
mean
ignoring
their
relation
to
possible
perceptual
experiences
with
which
they
may
be
connected
which
they
may
lead
to
and
terminate
in
and
which
then
they
may
be
supposed
to
taking
them
in
this
way
first
we
confine
the
problem
to
a
world
merely
and
not
directly
felt
or
seen
this
world
just
like
the
world
of
percepts
comes
to
us
at
first
as
a
chaos
of
experiences
but
lines
of
order
soon
get
traced
we
find
that
any
bit
of
it
which
we
may
cut
out
as
an
example
is
connected
with
distinct
groups
of
associates
just
as
our
perceptual
experiences
are
that
these
associates
link
themselves
with
it
by
different
relations
and
that
one
forms
the
inner
history
of
a
person
while
the
other
acts
as
an
impersonal
world
either
spatial
and
temporal
or
else
merely
logical
or
mathematical
or
otherwise
the
first
obstacle
on
the
part
of
the
reader
to
seeing
that
these
experiences
have
objectivity
as
well
as
subjectivity
will
probably
be
due
to
the
intrusion
into
his
mind
of
that
third
group
of
associates
with
which
the
experiences
have
relations
and
which
as
a
whole
they
standing
to
them
as
thoughts
to
things
this
important
function
of
the
experiences
complicates
the
question
and
confuses
it
for
so
used
are
we
to
treat
percepts
as
the
sole
genuine
realities
that
unless
we
keep
them
out
of
the
discussion
we
tend
altogether
to
overlook
the
objectivity
that
lies
in
experiences
by
themselves
we
treat
them
percepts
as
they
do
as
through
and
through
subjective
and
say
that
they
are
wholly
constituted
of
the
stuff
called
consciousness
using
this
term
now
for
a
kind
of
entity
after
the
fashion
which
i
am
seeking
to
refute
abstracting
then
from
percepts
altogether
what
i
maintain
is
that
any
single
experience
tends
to
get
counted
twice
over
just
as
a
perceptual
experience
does
figuring
in
one
context
as
an
object
or
field
of
objects
in
another
as
a
state
of
mind
and
all
this
without
the
least
internal
on
its
own
part
into
consciousness
and
content
it
is
all
consciousness
in
one
taking
and
in
the
other
all
content
i
find
this
objectivity
of
experiences
this
complete
parallelism
in
point
of
reality
between
the
presently
felt
and
the
remotely
thought
so
well
set
forth
in
a
page
of
that
i
will
quote
it
as
it
stands
i
may
only
think
of
my
objects
says
professor
münsterberg
yet
in
my
living
thought
they
stand
before
me
exactly
as
perceived
objects
would
do
no
matter
how
different
the
two
ways
of
apprehending
them
may
be
in
their
genesis
the
book
here
lying
on
the
table
before
me
and
the
book
in
the
next
room
of
which
i
think
and
which
i
mean
to
get
are
both
in
the
same
sense
given
realities
for
me
realities
which
i
acknowledge
and
of
which
i
take
account
if
you
agree
that
the
perceptual
object
is
not
an
idea
within
me
but
that
percept
and
thing
as
indistinguishably
one
are
really
experienced
you
ought
not
to
believe
that
the
merely
object
is
hid
away
inside
of
the
thinking
subject
the
object
of
which
i
think
and
of
whose
existence
i
take
cognizance
without
letting
it
now
work
upon
my
senses
occupies
its
definite
place
in
the
outer
world
as
much
as
does
the
object
which
i
directly
see
what
is
true
of
the
here
and
the
there
is
also
true
of
the
now
and
the
then
i
know
of
the
thing
which
is
present
and
perceived
but
i
know
also
of
the
thing
which
yesterday
was
but
is
no
more
and
which
i
only
remember
both
can
determine
my
present
conduct
both
are
parts
of
the
reality
of
which
i
keep
account
it
is
true
that
of
much
of
the
past
i
am
uncertain
just
as
i
am
uncertain
of
much
of
what
is
present
if
it
be
but
dimly
perceived
but
the
interval
of
time
does
not
in
principle
alter
my
relation
to
the
object
does
not
transform
it
from
an
object
known
into
a
mental
state
the
things
in
the
room
here
which
i
survey
and
those
in
my
distant
home
of
which
i
think
the
things
of
this
minute
and
those
of
my
boyhood
influence
and
decide
me
alike
with
a
reality
which
my
experience
of
them
directly
feels
they
both
make
up
my
real
world
they
make
it
directly
they
do
not
have
first
to
be
introduced
to
me
and
mediated
by
ideas
which
now
and
here
arise
within
me
this
character
of
my
recollections
and
expectations
does
not
imply
that
the
external
objects
of
which
i
am
aware
in
those
experiences
should
necessarily
be
there
also
for
others
the
objects
of
dreamers
and
hallucinated
persons
are
wholly
without
general
validity
but
even
were
they
centaurs
and
golden
mountains
they
still
would
be
there
in
fairy
land
and
not
of
ourselves
this
certainly
is
the
immediate
primary
naïf
or
practical
way
of
taking
our
world
were
there
no
perceptual
world
to
serve
as
its
in
taine
sense
by
being
and
more
genuinely
so
that
the
whole
merely
world
seems
weak
and
inner
in
comparison
our
world
of
thought
would
be
the
only
world
and
would
enjoy
complete
reality
in
our
belief
this
actually
happens
in
our
dreams
and
in
our
so
long
as
percepts
do
not
interrupt
them
and
yet
just
as
the
seen
room
to
go
back
to
our
late
example
is
a
field
of
consciousness
so
the
conceived
or
recollected
room
is
a
state
of
mind
and
the
of
the
experience
has
in
both
cases
similar
grounds
the
room
namely
has
many
couplings
with
many
things
some
of
these
couplings
are
inconstant
others
are
stable
in
the
reader
personal
history
the
room
occupies
a
single
date
he
saw
it
only
once
perhaps
a
year
ago
of
the
house
history
on
the
other
hand
it
forms
a
permanent
ingredient
some
couplings
have
the
curious
stubbornness
to
borrow
royce
term
of
fact
others
show
the
fluidity
of
fancy
we
let
them
come
and
go
as
we
please
grouped
with
the
rest
of
its
house
with
the
name
of
its
town
of
its
owner
builder
value
decorative
plan
the
room
maintains
a
definite
foothold
to
which
if
we
try
to
loosen
it
it
tends
to
return
and
to
reassert
itself
with
force
with
these
associates
in
a
word
it
coheres
while
to
other
houses
other
towns
other
owners
it
shows
no
tendency
to
cohere
at
all
the
two
collections
first
of
its
cohesive
and
second
of
its
loose
associates
inevitably
come
to
be
contrasted
we
call
the
first
collection
the
system
of
external
realities
in
the
midst
of
which
the
room
as
exists
the
other
we
call
the
stream
of
our
internal
thinking
in
which
as
a
image
it
for
a
moment
floats
the
room
thus
again
gets
counted
twice
over
it
plays
two
different
rôles
being
and
the
and
the
both
in
one
and
all
this
without
paradox
or
mystery
just
as
the
same
material
thing
may
be
both
low
and
high
or
small
and
great
or
bad
and
good
because
of
its
relations
to
opposite
parts
of
an
environing
world
as
we
say
that
the
experience
represents
as
it
is
represented
what
represents
and
what
is
represented
is
here
numerically
the
same
but
we
must
remember
that
no
dualism
of
being
represented
and
representing
resides
in
the
experience
in
its
pure
state
or
when
isolated
there
is
no
of
it
into
consciousness
and
what
the
consciousness
is
its
subjectivity
and
objectivity
are
functional
attributes
solely
realized
only
when
the
experience
is
twice
considered
along
with
its
two
differing
contexts
respectively
by
a
new
retrospective
experience
of
which
that
whole
past
complication
now
forms
the
fresh
content
the
instant
field
of
the
present
is
at
all
times
what
i
call
the
experience
it
is
only
virtually
or
potentially
either
object
or
subject
as
yet
for
the
time
being
it
is
plain
unqualified
actuality
or
existence
a
simple
in
this
immediacy
it
is
of
course
it
is
we
upon
it
and
the
doubling
of
it
in
retrospection
into
a
state
of
mind
and
a
reality
intended
thereby
is
just
one
of
the
acts
the
of
mind
first
treated
explicitly
as
such
in
retrospection
will
stand
corrected
or
confirmed
and
the
retrospective
experience
in
its
turn
will
get
a
similar
treatment
but
the
immediate
experience
in
its
passing
is
always
practical
truth
to
act
at
its
own
movement
if
the
world
were
then
and
there
to
go
out
like
a
candle
it
would
remain
truth
absolute
and
objective
for
it
would
be
last
word
would
have
no
critic
and
no
one
would
ever
oppose
the
thought
in
it
to
the
reality
intended
i
think
i
may
now
claim
to
have
made
my
thesis
clear
consciousness
connotes
a
kind
of
external
relation
and
does
not
denote
a
special
stuff
or
way
of
being
peculiarity
of
our
experiences
that
they
not
only
are
but
are
known
which
their
quality
is
invoked
to
explain
is
better
explained
by
their
relations
these
relations
themselves
being
experiences
to
one
iv
were
i
now
to
go
on
to
treat
of
the
knowing
of
perceptual
by
conceptual
experiences
it
would
again
prove
to
be
an
affair
of
external
relations
one
experience
would
be
the
knower
the
other
the
reality
known
and
i
could
perfectly
well
define
without
the
notion
of
what
the
knowing
actually
and
practically
amounts
to
namely
and
percepts
through
a
series
of
transitional
experiences
which
the
world
supplies
but
i
will
not
treat
of
this
space
being
insufficient
i
will
rather
consider
a
few
objections
that
are
sure
to
be
urged
against
the
entire
theory
as
it
stands
v
first
of
all
this
will
be
asked
if
experience
has
not
existence
if
it
be
not
partly
made
of
of
what
then
is
it
made
matter
we
know
and
thought
we
know
and
conscious
content
we
know
but
neutral
and
simple
experience
is
something
we
know
not
at
all
say
it
consists
of
for
it
must
consist
of
something
or
be
willing
to
give
it
up
to
this
challenge
the
reply
is
easy
although
for
fluency
sake
i
myself
spoke
early
in
this
article
of
a
stuff
of
pure
experience
i
have
now
to
say
that
there
is
no
stuff
of
which
experience
at
large
is
made
there
are
as
many
stuffs
as
there
are
in
the
things
experienced
if
you
ask
what
any
one
bit
of
pure
experience
is
made
of
the
answer
is
always
the
same
it
is
made
of
of
just
what
appears
of
space
of
intensity
of
flatness
brownness
heaviness
or
what
not
shadworth
hodgson
analysis
here
leaves
nothing
to
be
desired
experience
is
only
a
collective
name
for
all
these
sensible
natures
and
save
for
time
and
space
and
if
you
like
for
there
appears
no
universal
element
of
which
all
things
are
made
vi
the
next
objection
is
more
formidable
in
fact
it
sounds
quite
crushing
when
one
hears
it
first
if
it
be
the
piece
of
pure
experience
taken
twice
over
that
serves
now
as
thought
and
now
as
thing
so
the
objection
runs
how
comes
it
that
its
attributes
should
differ
so
fundamentally
in
the
two
takings
as
thing
the
experience
is
extended
as
thought
it
occupies
no
space
or
place
as
thing
it
is
red
hard
heavy
but
who
ever
heard
of
a
red
hard
or
heavy
thought
yet
even
now
you
said
that
an
experience
is
made
of
just
what
appears
and
what
appears
is
just
such
adjectives
how
can
the
one
experience
in
its
be
made
of
them
consist
of
them
carry
them
as
its
own
attributes
while
in
its
it
disowns
them
and
attributes
them
elsewhere
there
is
a
here
from
which
the
radical
dualism
of
thought
and
thing
is
the
only
truth
that
can
save
us
only
if
the
thought
is
one
kind
of
being
can
the
adjectives
exist
in
it
to
use
the
scholastic
term
only
if
the
thing
is
another
kind
can
they
exist
in
it
constitutively
and
energetically
no
simple
subject
can
take
the
same
adjectives
and
at
one
time
be
qualified
by
it
and
at
another
time
be
merely
it
as
of
something
only
meant
or
known
the
solution
insisted
on
by
this
objector
like
many
other
solutions
grows
the
less
satisfactory
the
more
one
turns
it
in
mind
to
begin
with
thought
and
thing
as
heterogeneous
as
is
commonly
said
no
one
denies
that
they
have
some
categories
in
common
their
relations
to
time
are
identical
both
moreover
may
have
parts
for
psychologists
in
general
treat
thoughts
as
having
them
and
both
may
be
complex
or
simple
both
are
of
kinds
can
be
compared
added
and
subtracted
and
arranged
in
serial
orders
all
sorts
of
adjectives
qualify
our
thoughts
which
appear
incompatible
with
consciousness
being
as
such
a
bare
diaphaneity
for
instance
they
are
natural
and
easy
or
laborious
they
are
beautiful
happy
intense
interesting
wise
idiotic
focal
marginal
insipid
confused
vague
precise
rational
casual
general
particular
and
many
things
besides
moreover
the
chapters
on
in
the
are
full
of
facts
that
make
for
the
essential
homogeneity
of
thought
with
thing
how
if
and
were
separated
the
whole
diameter
of
being
and
had
no
attributes
in
common
could
it
be
so
hard
to
tell
in
a
presented
and
recognized
material
object
what
part
comes
in
through
the
and
what
part
comes
of
one
own
head
sensations
and
apperceptive
ideas
fuse
here
so
intimately
that
you
can
no
more
tell
where
one
begins
and
the
other
ends
than
you
can
tell
in
those
cunning
circular
panoramas
that
have
lately
been
exhibited
where
the
real
foreground
and
the
painted
canvas
join
together
descartes
for
the
first
time
defined
thought
as
the
absolutely
unextended
and
later
philosophers
have
accepted
the
description
as
correct
but
what
possible
meaning
has
it
to
say
that
when
we
think
of
a
or
a
square
yard
extension
is
not
attributable
to
our
thought
of
every
extended
object
the
mental
picture
must
have
all
the
extension
of
the
object
itself
the
difference
between
objective
and
subjective
extension
is
one
of
relation
to
a
context
solely
in
the
mind
the
various
extents
maintain
no
necessarily
stubborn
order
relatively
to
each
other
while
in
the
physical
world
they
bound
each
other
stably
and
added
together
make
the
great
enveloping
unit
which
we
believe
in
and
call
real
space
as
they
carry
themselves
adversely
so
to
speak
to
one
another
exclude
one
another
and
maintain
their
distances
while
as
their
order
is
loose
and
they
form
a
in
which
unity
is
lost
but
to
argue
from
this
that
inner
experience
is
absolutely
inextensive
seems
to
me
little
short
of
absurd
the
two
worlds
differ
not
by
the
presence
or
absence
of
extension
but
by
the
relations
of
the
extensions
which
in
both
worlds
exist
does
not
this
case
of
extension
now
put
us
on
the
track
of
truth
in
the
case
of
other
qualities
it
does
and
i
am
surprised
that
the
facts
should
not
have
been
noticed
long
ago
why
for
example
do
we
call
a
fire
hot
and
water
wet
and
yet
refuse
to
say
that
our
mental
state
when
it
is
these
objects
is
either
wet
or
hot
at
any
rate
and
when
the
mental
state
is
a
vivid
image
hotness
and
wetness
are
in
it
just
as
much
as
they
are
in
the
physical
experience
the
reason
is
this
that
as
the
general
chaos
of
all
our
experiences
gets
sifted
we
find
that
there
are
some
fires
that
will
always
burn
sticks
and
always
warm
our
bodies
and
that
there
are
some
waters
that
will
always
put
out
fires
while
there
are
other
fires
and
waters
that
will
not
act
at
all
the
general
group
of
experiences
that
that
do
not
only
possess
their
natures
intrinsically
but
wear
them
adjectively
and
energetically
turning
them
against
one
another
comes
inevitably
to
be
contrasted
with
the
group
whose
members
having
identically
the
same
natures
fail
to
manifest
them
in
the
way
i
make
for
myself
now
an
experience
of
blazing
fire
i
place
it
near
my
body
but
it
does
not
warm
me
in
the
least
i
lay
a
stick
upon
it
and
the
stick
either
burns
or
remains
green
as
i
please
i
call
up
water
and
pour
it
on
the
fire
and
absolutely
no
difference
ensues
i
account
for
all
such
facts
by
calling
this
whole
train
of
experiences
unreal
a
mental
train
mental
fire
is
what
wo
burn
real
sticks
mental
water
is
what
wo
necessarily
though
of
course
it
may
put
out
even
a
mental
fire
mental
knives
may
be
sharp
but
they
wo
cut
real
wood
mental
triangles
are
pointed
but
their
points
wo
wound
with
objects
on
the
contrary
consequences
always
accrue
and
thus
the
real
experiences
get
sifted
from
the
mental
ones
the
things
from
our
thoughts
of
them
fanciful
or
true
and
precipitated
together
as
the
stable
part
of
the
whole
under
the
name
of
the
physical
world
of
this
our
perceptual
experiences
are
the
nucleus
they
being
the
originally
strong
experiences
we
add
a
lot
of
conceptual
experiences
to
them
making
these
strong
also
in
imagination
and
building
out
the
remoter
parts
of
the
physical
world
by
their
means
and
around
this
core
of
reality
the
world
of
laxly
connected
fancies
and
mere
rhapsodical
objects
floats
like
a
bank
of
clouds
in
the
clouds
all
sorts
of
rules
are
violated
which
in
the
core
are
kept
extensions
there
can
be
indefinitely
located
motion
there
obeys
no
newton
laws
vii
there
is
a
peculiar
class
of
experiences
to
which
whether
we
take
them
as
subjective
or
as
objective
we
their
several
natures
as
attributes
because
in
both
contexts
they
affect
their
associates
actively
though
in
neither
quite
as
or
as
sharply
as
things
affect
one
another
by
their
physical
energies
i
refer
here
to
which
form
an
ambiguous
sphere
of
being
belonging
with
emotion
on
the
one
hand
and
having
objective
on
the
other
yet
seeming
not
quite
inner
nor
quite
outer
as
if
a
diremption
had
begun
but
had
not
made
itself
complete
experiences
of
painful
objects
for
example
are
usually
also
painful
experiences
perceptions
of
loveliness
of
ugliness
tend
to
pass
muster
as
lovely
or
as
ugly
perceptions
intuitions
of
the
morally
lofty
are
lofty
intuitions
sometimes
the
adjective
wanders
as
if
uncertain
where
to
fix
itself
shall
we
speak
of
seductive
visions
or
of
visions
of
seductive
things
of
wicked
desires
or
of
desires
for
wickedness
of
healthy
thoughts
or
of
thoughts
of
healthy
objects
of
good
impulses
or
of
impulses
towards
the
good
of
feelings
of
anger
or
of
angry
feelings
both
in
the
mind
and
in
the
thing
these
natures
modify
their
context
exclude
certain
associates
and
determine
others
have
their
mates
and
incompatibles
yet
not
as
stubbornly
as
in
the
case
of
physical
qualities
for
beauty
and
ugliness
love
and
hatred
pleasant
and
painful
can
in
certain
complex
experiences
coexist
if
one
were
to
make
an
evolutionary
construction
of
how
a
lot
of
originally
chaotic
pure
experiences
became
gradually
differentiated
into
an
orderly
inner
and
outer
world
the
whole
theory
would
turn
upon
success
in
explaining
how
or
why
the
quality
of
an
experience
once
active
could
become
less
so
and
from
being
an
energetic
attribute
in
some
cases
elsewhere
lapse
into
the
status
of
an
inert
or
merely
internal
this
would
be
the
of
the
psychical
from
the
bosom
of
the
physical
in
which
the
esthetic
moral
and
otherwise
emotional
experiences
would
represent
a
halfway
stage
viii
but
a
last
cry
of
will
probably
go
up
from
many
readers
all
very
pretty
as
a
piece
of
ingenuity
they
will
say
but
our
consciousness
itself
intuitively
contradicts
you
we
for
our
part
that
we
are
conscious
we
our
thought
flowing
as
a
life
within
us
in
absolute
contrast
with
the
objects
which
it
so
unremittingly
escorts
we
can
not
be
faithless
to
this
immediate
intuition
the
dualism
is
a
fundamental
let
no
man
join
what
god
has
put
asunder
my
reply
to
this
is
my
last
word
and
i
greatly
grieve
that
to
many
it
will
sound
materialistic
i
can
not
help
that
however
for
i
too
have
my
intuitions
and
i
must
obey
them
let
the
case
be
what
it
may
in
others
i
am
as
confident
as
i
am
of
anything
that
in
myself
the
stream
of
thinking
which
i
recognize
emphatically
as
a
phenomenon
is
only
a
careless
name
for
what
when
scrutinized
reveals
itself
to
consist
chiefly
of
the
stream
of
my
breathing
the
think
which
kant
said
must
be
able
to
accompany
all
my
objects
is
the
breathe
which
actually
does
accompany
them
there
are
other
internal
facts
besides
breathing
intracephalic
muscular
adjustments
of
which
i
have
said
a
word
in
my
larger
psychology
and
these
increase
the
assets
of
so
far
as
the
latter
is
subject
to
immediate
perception
but
breath
which
was
ever
the
original
of
breath
moving
outwards
between
the
glottis
and
the
nostrils
is
i
am
persuaded
the
essence
out
of
which
philosophers
have
constructed
the
entity
known
to
them
as
consciousness
entity
is
fictitious
while
thoughts
in
the
concrete
are
fully
real
but
thoughts
in
the
concrete
are
made
of
the
same
stuff
as
things
i
wish
i
might
believe
myself
to
have
made
that
plausible
in
this
article

perry
thinks
every

of

is
so
much
it
becomes
or
only
in
retrospection
when
a
fresh
experience
thinking
the
same
object
alters
and
corrects
it
but
the
corrective
experience
becomes
itself
in
turn
corrected
and
thus
experience
as
a
whole
is
a
process
in
which
what
is
objective
originally
forever
turns
subjective
turns
into
our
apprehension

a
world
of
pure
experience
it
is
difficult
not
to
notice
a
curious
unrest
in
the
philosophic
atmosphere
of
the
time
a
loosening
of
old
landmarks
a
softening
of
oppositions
a
mutual
borrowing
from
one
another
on
the
part
of
systems
anciently
closed
and
an
interest
in
new
suggestions
however
vague
as
if
the
one
thing
sure
were
the
inadequacy
of
the
extant
the
dissatisfaction
with
these
seems
due
for
the
most
part
to
a
feeling
that
they
are
too
abstract
and
academic
life
is
confused
and
superabundant
and
what
the
younger
generation
appears
to
crave
is
more
of
the
temperament
of
life
in
its
philosophy
even
though
it
were
at
some
cost
of
logical
rigor
and
of
formal
purity
transcendental
idealism
is
inclining
to
let
the
world
wag
incomprehensibly
in
spite
of
its
absolute
subject
and
his
unity
of
purpose
berkeleyan
idealism
is
abandoning
the
principle
of
parsimony
and
dabbling
in
panpsychic
speculations
empiricism
flirts
with
teleology
and
strangest
of
all
natural
realism
so
long
decently
buried
raises
its
head
above
the
turf
and
finds
glad
hands
outstretched
from
the
most
unlikely
quarters
to
help
it
to
its
feet
again
we
are
all
biased
by
our
personal
feelings
i
know
and
i
am
personally
discontented
with
extant
solutions
so
i
seem
to
read
the
signs
of
a
great
unsettlement
as
if
the
upheaval
of
more
real
conceptions
and
more
fruitful
methods
were
imminent
as
if
a
true
landscape
might
result
less
clipped
and
artificial
if
philosophy
be
really
on
the
eve
of
any
considerable
rearrangement
the
time
should
be
propitious
for
any
one
who
has
suggestions
of
his
own
to
bring
forward
for
many
years
past
my
mind
has
been
growing
into
a
certain
type
of
rightly
or
wrongly
i
have
got
to
the
point
where
i
can
hardly
see
things
in
any
other
pattern
i
propose
therefore
to
describe
the
pattern
as
clearly
as
i
can
consistently
with
great
brevity
and
to
throw
my
description
into
the
bubbling
vat
of
publicity
where
jostled
by
rivals
and
torn
by
critics
it
will
eventually
either
disappear
from
notice
or
else
if
better
luck
befall
it
quietly
subside
to
the
profundities
and
serve
as
a
possible
ferment
of
new
growths
or
a
nucleus
of
new
crystallization
i
radical
empiricism
i
give
the
name
of
empiricism
to
my
empiricism
is
known
as
the
opposite
of
rationalism
rationalism
tends
to
emphasize
universals
and
to
make
wholes
prior
to
parts
in
the
order
of
logic
as
well
as
in
that
of
being
empiricism
on
the
contrary
lays
the
explanatory
stress
upon
the
part
the
element
the
individual
and
treats
the
whole
as
a
collection
and
the
universal
as
an
abstraction
my
description
of
things
accordingly
starts
with
the
parts
and
makes
of
the
whole
a
being
of
the
second
order
it
is
essentially
a
mosaic
philosophy
a
philosophy
of
plural
facts
like
that
of
hume
and
his
descendants
who
refer
these
facts
neither
to
substances
in
which
they
inhere
nor
to
an
absolute
mind
that
creates
them
as
its
objects
but
it
differs
from
the
humian
type
of
empiricism
in
one
particular
which
makes
me
add
the
epithet
radical
to
be
radical
an
empiricism
must
neither
admit
into
its
constructions
any
element
that
is
not
directly
experienced
nor
exclude
from
them
any
element
that
is
directly
experienced
for
such
a
philosophy
relations
that
connect
experiences
must
themselves
be
experienced
relations
and
any
kind
of
relation
experienced
must
be
accounted
as
as
anything
else
in
the
elements
may
indeed
be
redistributed
the
original
placing
of
things
getting
corrected
but
a
real
place
must
be
found
for
every
kind
of
thing
experienced
whether
term
or
relation
in
the
final
philosophic
arrangement
now
ordinary
empiricism
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
conjunctive
and
disjunctive
relations
present
themselves
as
being
fully
parts
of
experience
has
always
shown
a
tendency
to
do
away
with
the
connections
of
things
and
to
insist
most

disjunctions

as

of

and
the

all
experience
by
association
and
the
theory
are
examples
of
what
i
mean
the
natural
result
of
such
a
has
been
the
efforts
of
rationalism
to
correct
its
incoherencies
by
the
addition
of
agents
of
unification
substances
intellectual
categories
and
powers
or
selves
whereas
if
empiricism
had
only
been
radical
and
taken
everything
that
comes
without
disfavor
conjunction
as
well
as
separation
each
at
its
face
value
the
results
would
have
called
for
no
such
artificial
correction
as
i
understand
it
full
justice
to
conjunctive
without
however
treating
them
as
rationalism
always
tends
to
treat
them
as
being
true
in
some
supernal
way
as
if
the
unity
of
things
and
their
variety
belonged
to
different
orders
of
truth
and
vitality

ii
conjunctive
relations
relations
are
of
different
degrees
of
intimacy
merely
to
be
one
another
in
a
universe
of
discourse
is
the
most
external
relation
that
terms
can
have
and
seems
to
involve
nothing
whatever
as
to
farther
consequences
simultaneity
and
come
next
and
then
and
distance
after
them
similarity
and
difference
carrying
the
possibility
of
many
inferences
then
relations
of

tying
terms
into

involving

resistance
and
the
causal
order
generally
finally
the
relation
experienced
between
terms

form

and
are
immediately
conscious
of
continuing
each
other
the
organization
of
the
self
as
a
system
of
memories
purposes
strivings
fulfilments
or
disappointments
is
incidental
to
this
most
intimate
of
all
relations
the
terms
of
which
seem
in
many
cases
actually
to
compenetrate
and
suffuse
each
other
being
philosophy
has
always
turned
on
grammatical
particles
with
near
next
like
from
towards
against
because
for
through
my
these
words
designate
types
of
conjunctive
relation
arranged
in
a
roughly
ascending
order
of
intimacy
and
inclusiveness
we
can
imagine
a
universe
of
withness
but
no
nextness
or
one
of
nextness
but
no
likeness
or
of
likeness
with
no
activity
or
of
activity
with
no
purpose
or
of
purpose
with
no
ego
these
would
be
universes
each
with
its
own
grade
of
unity
the
universe
of
human
experience
is
by
one
or
another
of
its
parts
of
each
and
all
these
grades
whether
or
not
it
possibly
enjoys
some
still
more
absolute
grade
of
union
does
not
appear
upon
the
surface
taken
as
it
does
appear
our
universe
is
to
a
large
extent
chaotic
no
one
single
type
of
connection
runs
through
all
the
experiences
that
compose
it
if
we
take
they
fail
to
connect
minds
into
any
regular
system
causes
and
purposes
obtain
only
among
special
series
of
facts
the
seems
extremely
limited
and
does
not
link
two
different
selves
together
if
you
should
liken
the
universe
of
absolute
idealism
to
an
aquarium
a
crystal
globe
in
which
goldfish
are
swimming
you
would
have
to
compare
the
empiricist
universe
to
something
more
like
one
of
those
dried
human
heads
with
which
the
dyaks
of
borneo
deck
their
lodges
the
skull
forms
a
solid
nucleus
but
innumerable
feathers
leaves
strings
beads
and
loose
appendices
of
every
description
float
and
dangle
from
it
and
save
that
they
terminate
in
it
seem
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
even
so
my
experiences
and
yours
float
and
dangle
terminating
it
is
true
in
a
nucleus
of
common
perception
but
for
the
most
part
out
of
sight
and
irrelevant
and
unimaginable
to
one
another
this
imperfect
intimacy
this
bare
relation
of
between
some
parts
of
the
sum
total
of
experience
and
other
parts
is
the
fact
that
ordinary
empiricism
against
rationalism
the
latter
always
tending
to
ignore
it
unduly
radical
empiricism
on
the
contrary
is
fair
to
both
the
unity
and
the
disconnection
it
finds
no
reason
for
treating
either
as
illusory
it
allots
to
each
its
definite
sphere
of
description
and
agrees
that
there
appear
to
be
actual
forces
at
work
which
tend
as
time
goes
on
to
make
the
unity
greater
the
conjunctive
relation
that
has
given
most
trouble
to
philosophy
is
the
so
to
call
it
by
which
one
experience
passes
into
another
when
both
belong
to
the
same
self
about
the
facts
there
is
no
question
my
experiences
and
your
experiences
are
each
other
in
various
external
ways
but
mine
pass
into
mine
and
yours
pass
into
yours
in
a
way
in
which
yours
and
mine
never
pass
into
one
another
within
each
of
our
personal
histories
subject
object
interest
and
purpose
continuous
or
may
be
personal
histories
are
processes
of
change
in
time
and
change
itself
is
one
of
the
things
immediately
in
this
case
means
continuous
as
opposed
to
discontinuous
transition
but
continuous
transition
is
one
sort
of
a
conjunctive
relation
and
to
be
a
radical
empiricist
means
to
hold
fast
to
this
conjunctive
relation
of
all
others
for
this
is
the
strategic
point
the
position
through
which
if
a
hole
be
made
all
the
corruptions
of
dialectics
and
all
the
metaphysical
fictions
pour
into
our
philosophy
the
holding
fast
to
this
relation
means
taking
it
at
its
face
value
neither
less
nor
more
and
to
take
it
at
its
face
value
means
first
of
all
to
take
it
just
as
we
feel
it
and
not
to
confuse
ourselves
with
abstract
talk
it
involving
words
that
drive
us
to
invent
secondary
conceptions
in
order
to
neutralize
their
suggestions
and
to
make
our
actual
experience
again
seem
rationally
possible
what
i
do
feel
simply
when
a
later
moment
of
my
experience
succeeds
an
earlier
one
is
that
though
they
are
two
moments
the
transition
from
the
one
to
the
other
is
continuity
here
is
a
definite
sort
of
experience
just
as
definite
as
is
the
which
i
find
it
impossible
to
avoid
when
i
seek
to
make
the
transition
from
an
experience
of
my
own
to
one
of
yours
in
this
latter
case
i
have
to
get
on
and
off
again
to
pass
from
a
thing
lived
to
another
thing
only
conceived
and
the
break
is
positively
experienced
and
noted
though
the
functions
exerted
by
my
experience
and
by
yours
may
be
the
same
the
same
objects
known
and
the
same
purposes
followed
yet
the
sameness
has
in
this
case
to
be
ascertained
expressly
and
often
with
difficulty
and
uncertainty
after
the
break
has
been
felt
whereas
in
passing
from
one
of
my
own
moments
to
another
the
sameness
of
object
and
interest
is
unbroken
and
both
the
earlier
and
the
later
experience
are
of
things
directly
lived
there
is
no
other
no
other
whatness
than
this
absence
of
break
and
this
sense
of
continuity
in
that
most
intimate
of
all
conjunctive
relations
the
passing
of
one
experience
into
another
when
they
belong
to
the
same
self
and
this
whatness
is
real
empirical
just
as
the
whatness
of
separation
and
discontinuity
is
real
content
in
the
contrasted
case
practically
to
experience
one
personal
continuum
in
this
living
way
is
to
know
the
originals
of
the
ideas
of
continuity
and
of
sameness
to
know
what
the
words
stand
for
concretely
to
own
all
that
they
can
ever
mean
but
all
experiences
have
their
conditions
and
intellects
thinking
about
the
facts
here
and
asking
how
they
are
possible
have
ended
by
substituting
a
lot
of
static
objects
of
conception
for
the
direct
perceptual
experiences
sameness
they
have
said
must
be
a
stark
numerical
identity
it
ca
run
on
from
next
to
next
continuity
ca
mean
mere
absence
of
gap
for
if
you
say
two
things
are
in
immediate
contact
the
contact
how
can
they
be
two
if
on
the
other
hand
you
put
a
relation
of
transition
between
them
that
itself
is
a
third
thing
and
needs
to
be
related
or
hitched
to
its
terms
an
infinite
series
is
involved
and
so
on
the
result
is
that
from
difficulty
to
difficulty
the
plain
conjunctive
experience
has
been
discredited
by
both
schools
the
empiricists
leaving
things
permanently
disjoined
and
the
rationalist
remedying
the
looseness
by
their
absolutes
or
substances
or
whatever
other
fictitious
agencies
of
union
they
may
have
employed
from
all
which
artificiality
we
can
be
saved
by
a
couple
of
simple
reflections
first
that
conjunctions
and
separations
are
at
all
events
phenomena
which
if
we
take
experiences
at
their
face
value
must
be
accounted
equally
real
and
second
that
if
we
insist
on
treating
things
as
really
separate
when
they
are
given
as
continuously
joined
invoking
when
union
is
required
transcendental
principles
to
overcome
the
separateness
we
have
assumed
then
we
ought
to
stand
ready
to
perform
the
converse
act
we
ought
to
invoke
higher
principles
of
also
to
make
our
merely
experienced
disjunctions
more
truly
real
failing
thus
we
ought
to
let
the
originally
given
continuities
stand
on
their
own
bottom
we
have
no
right
to
be
lopsided
or
to
blow
capriciously
hot
and
cold
iii
the
cognitive
relation
the
first
great
pitfall
from
which
such
a
radical
standing
by
experience
will
save
us
is
an
artificial
conception
of
the
between
knower
and
throughout
the
history
of
philosophy
the
subject
and
its
object
have
been
treated
as
absolutely
discontinuous
entities
and
thereupon
the
presence
of
the
latter
to
the
former
or
the
by
the
former
of
the
latter
has
assumed
a
paradoxical
character
which
all
sorts
of
theories
had
to
be
invented
to
overcome
representative
theories
put
a
mental
or
into
the
gap
as
a
sort
of
intermediary
theories
left
the
gap
untouched
declaring
our
mind
able
to
clear
it
by
a
leap
transcendentalist
theories
left
it
impossible
to
traverse
by
finite
knowers
and
brought
an
absolute
in
to
perform
the
saltatory
act
all
the
while
in
the
very
bosom
of
the
finite
experience
every
conjunction
required
to
make
the
relation
intelligible
is
given
in
full
either
the
knower
and
the
known
are
the
piece
of
experience
taken
twice
over
in
different
contexts
or
they
are
two
pieces
of
experience
belonging
to
the
same
subject
with
definite
tracts
of
conjunctive
transitional
experience
between
them
or
the
known
is
a
experience
either
of
that
subject
or
another
to
which
the
said
conjunctive
transitions
lead
if
sufficiently
prolonged
to
discuss
all
the
ways
in
which
one
experience
may
function
as
the
knower
of
another
would
be
incompatible
with
the
limits
of
this
essay
i
have
just
treated
of
type
the
kind
of
knowledge
called
perception
this
is
the
type
of
case
in
which
the
mind
enjoys
direct
with
a
present
object
in
the
other
types
the
mind
has
an
object
not
immediately
there
of
type
the
simplest
sort
of
conceptual
knowledge
i
have
given
some
account
in
two
earlier
articles
type
can
always
formally
and
hypothetically
be
reduced
to
type
so
that
a
brief
description
of
that
type
will
put
the
present
reader
sufficiently
at
my
point
of
view
and
make
him
see
what
the
actual
meanings
of
the
mysterious
cognitive
relation
may
be
suppose
me
to
be
sitting
here
in
my
library
at
cambridge
at
ten
minutes
walk
from
hall
and
to
be
thinking
truly
of
the
latter
object
my
mind
may
have
before
it
only
the
name
or
it
may
have
a
clear
image
or
it
may
have
a
very
dim
image
of
the
hall
but
such
intrinsic
differences
in
the
image
make
no
difference
in
its
cognitive
function
certain
phenomena
special
experiences
of
conjunction
are
what
impart
to
the
image
be
it
what
it
may
its
knowing
office
for
instance
if
you
ask
me
what
hall
i
mean
by
my
image
and
i
can
tell
you
nothing
or
if
i
fail
to
point
or
lead
you
towards
the
harvard
delta
or
if
being
led
by
you
i
am
uncertain
whether
the
hall
i
see
be
what
i
had
in
mind
or
not
you
would
rightly
deny
that
i
had
that
particular
hall
at
all
even
though
my
mental
image
might
to
some
degree
have
resembled
it
the
resemblance
would
count
in
that
case
as
coincidental
merely
for
all
sorts
of
things
of
a
kind
resemble
one
another
in
this
world
without
being
held
for
that
reason
to
take
cognizance
of
one
another
on
the
other
hand
if
i
can
lead
you
to
the
hall
and
tell
you
of
its
history
and
present
uses
if
in
its
presence
i
feel
my
idea
however
imperfect
it
may
have
been
to
have
led
hither
and
to
be
now
if
the
associates
of
the
image
and
of
the
felt
hall
run
parallel
so
that
each
term
of
the
one
context
corresponds
serially
as
i
walk
with
an
answering
term
of
the
others
why
then
my
soul
was
prophetic
and
my
idea
must
be
and
by
common
consent
would
be
called
cognizant
of
reality
that
percept
was
what
i
for
into
it
my
idea
has
passed
by
conjunctive
experiences
of
sameness
and
fulfilled
intention
nowhere
is
there
jar
but
every
later
moment
continues
and
corroborates
an
earlier
one
in
this
continuing
and
corroborating
taken
in
no
transcendental
sense
but
denoting
definitely
felt
transitions
all
that
the
knowing
of
a
percept
by
an
idea
can
possibly
contain
or
wherever
such
transitions
are
felt
the
first
experience
the
last
one
where
they
do
not
or
where
even
as
possibles
they
can
not
intervene
there
can
be
no
pretence
of
knowing
in
this
latter
case
the
extremes
will
be
connected
if
connected
at
all
by
inferior
relations
bare
likeness
or
succession
or
by
alone
knowledge
of
sensible
realities
thus
comes
to
life
inside
the
tissue
of
experience
it
is
and
made
by
relations
that
unroll
themselves
in
time
whenever
certain
intermediaries
are
given
such
that
as
they
develop
towards
their
terminus
there
is
experience
from
point
to
point
of
one
direction
followed
and
finally
of
one
process
fulfilled
the
result
is
that
thereby
becomes
a
knower
and
their
terminus
an
object
meant
or
that
is
all
that
knowing
in
the
simple
case
considered
can
be
that
is
the
whole
of
its
nature
put
into
experiential
terms
whenever
such
is
the
sequence
of
our
experiences
we
may
freely
say
that
we
had
the
terminal
object
mind
from
the
outset
even
although
the
outset
nothing
was
there
in
us
but
a
flat
piece
of
substantive
experience
like
any
other
with
no
about
it
and
no
mystery
save
the
mystery
of
coming
into
existence
and
of
being
gradually
followed
by
other
pieces
of
substantive
experience
with
conjunctively
transitional
experiences
between
that
is
what
we
here
by
the
object
being
mind
of
any
deeper
more
real
way
of
being
in
mind
we
have
no
positive
conception
and
we
have
no
right
to
discredit
our
actual
experience
by
talking
of
such
a
way
at
all
i
know
that
many
a
reader
will
rebel
at
this
mere
intermediaries
he
will
say
even
though
they
be
feelings
of
continuously
growing
fulfilment
only
the
knower
from
the
known
whereas
what
we
have
in
knowledge
is
a
kind
of
immediate
touch
of
the
one
by
the
other
an
in
the
etymological
sense
of
the
word
a
leaping
of
the
chasm
as
by
lightning
an
act
by
which
two
terms
are
smitten
into
one
over
the
head
of
their
distinctness
all
these
dead
intermediaries
of
yours
are
out
of
each
other
and
outside
of
their
termini
still
but
do
not
such
dialectic
difficulties
remind
us
of
the
dog
dropping
his
bone
and
snapping
at
its
image
in
the
water
if
we
knew
any
more
real
kind
of
union
we
might
be
entitled
to
brand
all
our
empirical
unions
as
a
sham
but
unions
by
continuous
transition
are
the
only
ones
we
know
of
whether
in
this
matter
of
a
that
terminates
in
an
acquaintance
whether
in
personal
identity
in
logical
predication
through
the
copula
or
elsewhere
if
anywhere
there
were
more
absolute
unions
realized
they
could
only
reveal
themselves
to
us
by
just
such
conjunctive
results
these
are
what
the
unions
are
these
are
all
that
can
ever
practically
by
union
by
continuity
is
it
not
time
to
repeat
what
lotze
said
of
substances
that
to
one
is
to
one
should
we
not
say
here
that
to
be
experienced
as
continuous
is
to
be
really
continuous
in
a
world
where
experience
and
reality
come
to
the
same
thing
in
a
picture
gallery
a
painted
hook
will
serve
to
hang
a
painted
chain
by
a
painted
cable
will
hold
a
painted
ship
in
a
world
where
both
the
terms
and
their
distinctions
are
affairs
of
experience
conjunctions
that
are
experienced
must
be
at
least
as
real
as
anything
else
they
will
absolutely
real
conjunctions
if
we
have
no
transphenomenal
absolute
ready
to
derealize
the
whole
experienced
world
by
at
a
stroke
if
on
the
other
hand
we
had
such
an
absolute
not
one
of
our
theories
of
knowledge
could
remain
standing
any
better
than
ours
could
for
the
distinctions
as
well
as
the
conjunctions
of
experience
would
impartially
fall
its
prey
the
whole
question
of
how
thing
can
know
would
cease
to
be
a
real
one
at
all
in
a
world
where
otherness
itself
was
an
illusion
so
much
for
the
essentials
of
the
cognitive
relation
where
the
knowledge
is
conceptual
in
type
or
forms
knowledge
an
object
it
consists
in
intermediary
experiences
possible
if
not
actual
of
continuously
developing
progress
and
finally
of
fulfilment
when
the
sensible
percept
which
is
the
object
is
reached
the
percept
here
not
only
the
concept
proves
its
function
of
knowing
that
percept
to
be
true
but
the
percept
existence
as
the
terminus
of
the
chain
of
intermediaries
the
function
whatever
terminates
that
chain
was
because
it
now
proves
itself
to
be
what
the
concept
in
mind
the
towering
importance
for
human
life
of
this
kind
of
knowing
lies
in
the
fact
that
an
experience
that
knows
another
can
figure
as
its
not
in
any
sense
but
in
the
definite
practical
sense
of
being
its
in
various
operations
sometimes
physical
and
sometimes
mental
which
lead
us
to
its
associates
and
results
by
experimenting
on
our
ideas
of
reality
we
may
save
ourselves
the
trouble
of
experimenting
on
the
real
experiences
which
they
severally
mean
the
ideas
form
related
systems
corresponding
point
for
point
to
the
systems
which
the
realities
form
and
by
letting
an
ideal
term
call
up
its
associates
systematically
we
may
be
led
to
a
terminus
which
the
corresponding
real
term
would
have
led
to
in
case
we
had
operated
on
the
real
world
and
this
brings
us
to
the
general
question
of
substitution
iv
substitution
in
taine
brilliant
book
on
substitution
was
for
the
first
time
named
as
a
cardinal
logical
function
though
of
course
the
facts
had
always
been
familiar
enough
what
exactly
in
a
system
of
experiences
does
the
of
one
of
them
for
another
mean
according
to
my
view
experience
as
a
whole
is
a
process
in
time
whereby
innumerable
particular
terms
lapse
and
are
superseded
by
others
that
follow
upon
them
by
transitions
which
whether
disjunctive
or
conjunctive
in
content
are
themselves
experiences
and
must
in
general
be
accounted
at
least
as
real
as
the
terms
which
they
relate
what
the
nature
of
the
event
called
signifies
depends
altogether
on
the
kind
of
transition
that
obtains
some
experiences
simply
abolish
their
predecessors
without
continuing
them
in
any
way
others
are
felt
to
increase
or
to
enlarge
their
meaning
to
carry
out
their
purpose
or
to
bring
us
nearer
to
their
goal
they
them
and
may
fulfil
their
function
better
than
they
fulfilled
it
themselves
but
to
a
function
in
a
world
of
pure
experience
can
be
conceived
and
defined
in
only
one
possible
way
in
such
a
world
transitions
and
arrivals
or
terminations
are
the
only
events
that
happen
though
they
happen
by
so
many
sorts
of
path
the
only
function
that
one
experience
can
perform
is
to
lead
into
another
experience
and
the
only
fulfilment
we
can
speak
of
is
the
reaching
of
a
certain
experienced
end
when
one
experience
leads
to
or
can
lead
to
the
same
end
as
another
they
agree
in
function
but
the
whole
system
of
experiences
as
they
are
immediately
given
presents
itself
as
a
through
which
one
can
pass
out
of
an
initial
term
in
many
directions
and
yet
end
in
the
same
terminus
moving
from
next
to
next
by
a
great
many
possible
paths
either
one
of
these
paths
might
be
a
functional
substitute
for
another
and
to
follow
one
rather
than
another
might
on
occasion
be
an
advantageous
thing
to
do
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
in
a
general
way
the
paths
that
run
through
conceptual
experiences
that
is
through
or
that
the
things
in
which
they
terminate
are
highly
advantageous
paths
to
follow
not
only
do
they
yield
inconceivably
rapid
transitions
but
owing
to
the
character
which
they
frequently
possess
and
to
their
capacity
for
association
with
one
another
in
great
systems
they
outstrip
the
tardy
consecutions
of
the
things
themselves
and
sweep
us
on
towards
our
ultimate
termini
in
a
far
more
way
than
the
following
of
trains
of
sensible
perception
ever
could
wonderful
are
the
new
cuts
and
the
which
the
make
most
it
is
true
are
substitutes
for
nothing
actual
they
end
outside
the
real
world
altogether
in
wayward
fancies
utopias
fictions
or
mistakes
but
where
they
do
reality
and
terminate
therein
we
substitute
them
always
and
with
these
substitutes
we
pass
the
greater
number
of
our
hours
this
is
why
i
called
our
experiences
taken
all
together
a
there
is
vastly
more
discontinuity
in
the
sum
total
of
experiences
than
we
commonly
suppose
the
objective
nucleus
of
every
man
experience
his
own
body
is
it
is
true
a
continuous
percept
and
equally
continuous
as
a
percept
though
we
may
be
inattentive
to
it
is
the
material
environment
of
that
body
changing
by
gradual
transition
when
the
body
moves
but
the
distant
parts
of
the
physical
world
are
at
all
times
absent
from
us
and
form
conceptual
objects
merely
into
the
perceptual
reality
of
which
our
life
inserts
itself
at
points
discrete
and
relatively
rare
round
their
several
objective
nuclei
partly
shared
and
common
and
partly
discrete
of
the
real
physical
world
innumerable
thinkers
pursuing
their
several
lines
of
physically
true
cogitation
trace
paths
that
intersect
one
another
only
at
discontinuous
perceptual
points
and
the
rest
of
the
time
are
quite
incongruent
and
around
all
the
nuclei
of
shared
as
around
the
dyak
head
of
my
late
metaphor
floats
the
vast
cloud
of
experiences
that
are
wholly
subjective
that
are
that
find
not
even
an
eventual
ending
for
themselves
in
the
perceptual
world
the
mere
and
joys
and
sufferings
and
wishes
of
the
individual
minds
these
exist
one
another
indeed
and
with
the
objective
nuclei
but
out
of
them
it
is
probable
that
to
all
eternity
no
interrelated
system
of
any
kind
will
ever
be
made
this
notion
of
the
purely
substitutional
or
conceptual
physical
world
brings
us
to
the
most
critical
of
all
the
steps
in
the
development
of
a
philosophy
of
pure
experience
the
paradox
of
in
knowledge
comes
back
upon
us
here
but
i
think
that
our
notions
of
pure
experience
and
of
substitution
and
our
radically
empirical
view
of
conjunctive
transitions
are
that
will
carry
us
safely
through
the
pass
what
objective
reference
is
whosoever
feels
his
experience
to
be
something
substitutional
even
while
he
has
it
may
be
said
to
have
an
experience
that
reaches
beyond
itself
from
inside
of
its
own
entity
it
says
and
postulates
reality
existing
elsewhere
for
the
transcendentalist
who
holds
knowing
to
consist
in
a
across
an
chasm
such
an
idea
presents
no
difficulty
but
it
seems
at
first
sight
as
if
it
might
be
inconsistent
with
an
empiricism
like
our
own
have
we
not
explained
that
conceptual
knowledge
is
made
such
wholly
by
the
existence
of
things
that
fall
outside
of
the
knowing
experience
itself
by
intermediary
experiences
and
by
a
terminus
that
fulfils
can
the
knowledge
be
there
before
these
elements
that
constitute
its
being
have
come
and
if
knowledge
be
not
there
how
can
objective
reference
occur
the
key
to
this
difficulty
lies
in
the
distinction
between
knowing
as
verified
and
completed
and
the
same
knowing
as
in
transit
and
on
its
way
to
recur
to
the
memorial
hall
example
lately
used
it
is
only
when
our
idea
of
the
hall
has
actually
terminated
in
the
percept
that
we
know
certain
that
from
the
beginning
it
was
truly
cognitive
of
until
established
by
the
end
of
the
process
its
quality
of
knowing
that
or
indeed
of
knowing
anything
could
still
be
doubted
and
yet
the
knowing
really
was
there
as
the
result
now
shows
we
were
knowers
of
the
hall
long
before
we
were
certified
to
have
been
its
actual
knowers
by
the
percept
retroactive
validating
power
just
so
we
are
all
the
time
by
reason
of
the
virtuality
of
the
inevitable
event
which
will
make
us
so
when
it
shall
have
come
now
the
immensely
greater
part
of
all
our
knowing
never
gets
beyond
this
virtual
stage
it
never
is
completed
or
nailed
down
i
speak
not
merely
of
our
ideas
of
imperceptibles
like
or
dissociated
or
of
like
the
contents
of
our
neighbors
minds
i
speak
also
of
ideas
which
we
might
verify
if
we
would
take
the
trouble
but
which
we
hold
for
true
although
unterminated
perceptually
because
nothing
says
to
us
and
there
is
no
contradicting
truth
in
sight
continue
thinking
unchallenged
is
times
out
of
a
hundred
our
practical
substitute
for
knowing
in
the
completed
as
each
experience
runs
by
cognitive
transition
into
the
next
one
and
we
nowhere
feel
a
collision
with
what
we
elsewhere
count
as
truth
or
fact
we
commit
ourselves
to
the
current
as
if
the
port
were
sure
we
live
as
it
were
upon
the
front
edge
of
an
advancing
and
our
sense
of
a
determinate
direction
in
falling
forward
is
all
we
cover
of
the
future
of
our
path
it
is
as
if
a
differential
quotient
should
be
conscious
and
treat
itself
as
an
adequate
substitute
for
a
curve
our
experience
is
of
variations
of
rate
and
of
direction
and
lives
in
these
transitions
more
than
in
the
end
the
experiences
of
tendency
are
sufficient
to
act
upon
what
more
could
we
have
at
those
moments
even
if
the
later
verification
comes
complete
this
is
what
as
a
radical
empiricist
i
say
to
the
charge
that
the
objective
reference
which
is
so
flagrant
a
character
of
our
experiences
involves
a
chasm
and
a
mortal
leap
a
positively
conjunctive
transition
involves
neither
chasm
nor
leap
being
the
very
original
of
what
we
mean
by
continuity
it
makes
a
continuum
wherever
it
appears
i
know
full
well
that
such
brief
words
as
these
will
leave
the
hardened
transcendentalist
unshaken
conjunctive
experiences
their
terms
he
will
still
say
they
are
third
things
interposed
that
have
themselves
to
be
conjoined
by
new
links
and
to
invoke
them
makes
our
trouble
infinitely
worse
to
our
motion
forward
is
impossible
motion
implies
terminus
and
how
can
terminus
be
felt
before
we
have
arrived
the
barest
start
and
sally
forwards
the
barest
tendency
to
leave
the
instant
involves
the
chasm
and
the
leap
conjunctive
transitions
are
the
most
superficial
of
appearances
illusions
of
our
sensibility
which
philosophical
reflection
pulverizes
at
a
touch
conception
is
our
only
trustworthy
instrument
conception
and
the
absolute
working
hand
in
hand
conception
disintegrates
experience
utterly
but
its
disjunctions
are
easily
overcome
again
when
the
absolute
takes
up
the
task
such
transcendentalists
i
must
leave
provisionally
at
least
in
full
possession
of
their
creed
i
have
no
space
for
polemics
in
this
article
so
i
shall
simply
formulate
the
empiricist
doctrine
as
my
hypothesis
leaving
it
to
work
or
not
work
as
it
may
objective
reference
i
say
then
is
an
incident
of
the
fact
that
so
much
of
our
experience
comes
as
an
insufficient
and
consists
of
process
and
transition
our
fields
of
experience
have
no
more
definite
boundaries
than
have
our
fields
of
view
both
are
fringed
forever
by
a
that
continuously
develops
and
that
continuously
supersedes
them
as
life
proceeds
the
relations
generally
speaking
are
as
real
here
as
the
terms
are
and
the
only
complaint
of
the
transcendentalist
with
which
i
could
at
all
sympathize
would
be
his
charge
that
by
first
making
knowledge
to
consist
in
external
relations
as
i
have
done
and
by
then
confessing
that
of
the
time
these
are
not
actually
but
only
virtually
there
i
have
knocked
the
solid
bottom
out
of
the
whole
business
and
palmed
off
a
substitute
of
knowledge
for
the
genuine
thing
only
the
admission
such
a
critic
might
say
that
our
ideas
are
and
already
in
advance
of
the
experiences
that
are
to
terminate
them
can
bring
solidity
back
to
knowledge
in
a
world
like
this
in
which
transitions
and
terminations
are
only
by
exception
fulfilled
this
seems
to
me
an
excellent
place
for
applying
the
pragmatic
method
when
a
dispute
arises
that
method
consists
in
auguring
what
practical
consequences
would
be
different
if
one
side
rather
than
the
other
were
true
if
no
difference
can
be
thought
of
the
dispute
is
a
quarrel
over
words
what
then
would
the
affirmed
to
exist
in
advance
of
all
experiential
mediation
or
termination
be
what
would
it
practically
result
in
for
were
it
true
it
could
only
result
in
our
orientation
in
the
turning
of
our
expectations
and
practical
tendencies
into
the
right
path
and
the
right
path
here
so
long
as
we
and
the
object
are
not
yet
face
to
face
or
can
never
get
face
to
face
as
in
the
case
of
ejects
would
be
the
path
that
led
us
into
the
object
nearest
neighborhood
where
direct
acquaintance
is
lacking
about
is
the
next
best
thing
and
an
acquaintance
with
what
actually
lies
about
the
object
and
is
most
closely
related
to
it
puts
such
knowledge
within
our
grasp
and
your
anger
for
example
are
things
in
which
my
thoughts
will
never
terminate
but
my
concepts
of
them
lead
me
to
their
very
brink
to
the
chromatic
fringes
and
to
the
hurtful
words
and
deeds
which
are
their
really
next
effects
even
if
our
ideas
did
in
themselves
carry
the
postulated
it
would
still
remain
true
that
their
putting
us
into
possession
of
such
effects
be
the
sole
of
the
for
and
this
it
is
needless
to
say
is
et
what
our
empiricist
account
pays
in
on
pragmatist
principles
therefore
a
dispute
over
is
a
pure
logomachy
call
our
concepts
of
ejective
things
or
the
reverse
it
makes
no
difference
so
long
as
we
do
differ
about
the
nature
of
that
exalted
virtue
fruits
fruits
for
us
of
course
humanistic
fruits
if
an
absolute
were
proved
to
exist
for
other
reasons
it
might
well
appear
that
knowledge
is
terminated
in
innumerable
cases
where
ours
is
still
incomplete
that
however
would
be
a
fact
indifferent
to
our
knowledge
the
latter
would
grow
neither
worse
nor
better
whether
we
acknowledged
such
an
absolute
or
left
him
out
so
the
notion
of
a
knowledge
still
and
on
its
way
joins
hands
here
with
that
notion
of
a
experience
which
i
tried
to
explain
in
my
essay
entitled
consciousness
exist
the
instant
field
of
the
present
is
always
experience
in
its
state
plain
unqualified
actuality
a
simple
as
yet
undifferentiated
into
thing
and
thought
and
only
virtually
classifiable
as
objective
fact
or
as
some
one
opinion
about
fact
this
is
as
true
when
the
field
is
conceptual
as
when
it
is
perceptual
hall
is
in
my
idea
as
much
as
when
i
stand
before
it
i
proceed
to
act
on
its
account
in
either
case
only
in
the
later
experience
that
supersedes
the
present
one
is
this
immediacy
retrospectively
split
into
two
parts
a
and
its
and
the
content
corrected
or
confirmed
while
still
pure
or
present
any
experience
mine
for
example
of
what
i
write
about
in
these
very
lines
passes
for
the
morrow
may
reduce
it
to
the
transcendentalist
in
all
his
particular
knowledges
is
as
liable
to
this
reduction
as
i
am
his
absolute
does
not
save
him
why
then
need
he
quarrel
with
an
account
of
knowing
that
merely
leaves
it
liable
to
this
inevitable
condition
why
insist
that
knowing
is
a
static
relation
out
of
time
when
it
practically
seems
so
much
a
function
of
our
active
life
for
a
thing
to
be
valid
says
lotze
is
the
same
as
to
make
itself
valid
when
the
whole
universe
seems
only
to
be
making
itself
valid
and
to
be
still
incomplete
else
why
its
ceaseless
changing
why
of
all
things
should
knowing
be
exempt
why
should
it
not
be
making
itself
valid
like
everything
else
that
some
parts
of
it
may
be
already
valid
or
verified
beyond
dispute
the
empirical
philosopher
of
course
like
any
one
else
may
always
hope
vi
the
conterminousness
of
different
minds
with
transition
and
prospect
thus
enthroned
in
pure
experience
it
is
impossible
to
subscribe
to
the
idealism
of
the
english
school
radical
empiricism
has
in
fact
more
affinities
with
natural
realism
than
with
the
views
of
berkeley
or
of
mill
and
this
can
be
easily
shown
for
the
berkeleyan
school
ideas
the
verbal
equivalent
of
what
i
term
experiences
are
discontinuous
the
content
of
each
is
wholly
immanent
and
there
are
no
transitions
with
which
they
are
consubstantial
and
through
which
their
beings
may
unite
your
memorial
hall
and
mine
even
when
both
are
percepts
are
wholly
out
of
connection
with
each
other
our
lives
are
a
congeries
of
solipsisms
out
of
which
in
strict
logic
only
a
god
could
compose
a
universe
even
of
discourse
no
dynamic
currents
run
between
my
objects
and
your
objects
never
can
our
minds
meet
in
the
the
incredibility
of
such
a
philosophy
is
flagrant
it
is
strained
and
unnatural
in
a
supreme
degree
and
it
may
be
doubted
whether
even
berkeley
himself
who
took
it
so
religiously
really
believed
when
walking
through
the
streets
of
london
that
his
spirit
and
the
spirits
of
his
fellow
wayfarers
had
absolutely
different
towns
in
view
to
me
the
decisive
reason
in
favor
of
our
minds
meeting
in
common
objects
at
least
is
that
unless
i
make
that
supposition
i
have
no
motive
for
assuming
that
your
mind
exists
at
all
why
do
i
postulate
your
mind
because
i
see
your
body
acting
in
a
certain
way
its
gestures
facial
movements
words
and
conduct
generally
are
so
i
deem
it
actuated
as
my
own
is
by
an
inner
life
like
mine
this
argument
from
analogy
is
my
whether
an
instinctive
belief
runs
before
it
or
not
but
what
is
body
here
but
a
percept
in
field
it
is
only
as
animating
object
object
that
i
have
any
occasion
to
think
of
you
at
all
if
the
body
that
you
actuate
be
not
the
very
body
that
i
see
there
but
some
duplicate
body
of
your
own
with
which
that
has
nothing
to
do
we
belong
to
different
universes
you
and
i
and
for
me
to
speak
of
you
is
folly
myriads
of
such
universes
even
now
may
coexist
irrelevant
to
one
another
my
concern
is
solely
with
the
universe
with
which
my
own
life
is
connected
in
that
perceptual
part
of
universe
which
i
call
body
your
mind
and
my
mind
meet
and
may
be
called
conterminous
your
mind
actuates
that
body
and
mine
sees
it
my
thoughts
pass
into
it
as
into
their
harmonious
cognitive
fulfilment
your
emotions
and
volitions
pass
into
it
as
causes
into
their
effects
but
that
percept
hangs
together
with
all
our
other
physical
percepts
they
are
of
one
stuff
with
it
and
if
it
be
our
common
possession
they
must
be
so
likewise
for
instance
your
hand
lays
hold
of
one
end
of
a
rope
and
my
hand
lays
hold
of
the
other
end
we
pull
against
each
other
can
our
two
hands
be
mutual
objects
in
this
experience
and
the
rope
not
be
mutual
also
what
is
true
of
the
rope
is
true
of
any
other
percept
your
objects
are
over
and
over
again
the
same
as
mine
if
i
ask
you
some
object
of
yours
is
our
old
memorial
hall
for
example
you
point
to
memorial
hall
with
hand
which
see
if
you
alter
an
object
in
your
world
put
out
a
candle
for
example
when
i
am
present
candle
goes
out
it
is
only
as
altering
my
objects
that
i
guess
you
to
exist
if
your
objects
do
not
coalesce
with
my
objects
if
they
be
not
identically
where
mine
are
they
must
be
proved
to
be
positively
somewhere
else
but
no
other
location
can
be
assigned
for
them
so
their
place
must
be
what
it
seems
to
be
the
same
practically
then
our
minds
meet
in
a
world
of
objects
which
they
share
in
common
which
would
still
be
there
if
one
or
several
of
the
minds
were
destroyed
i
can
see
no
formal
objection
to
this
being
literally
true
on
the
principles
which
i
am
defending
a
or
consciousness
is
the
name
for
a
series
of
experiences
run
together
by
certain
definite
transitions
and
an
objective
reality
is
a
series
of
similar
experiences
knit
by
different
transitions
if
one
and
the
same
experience
can
figure
twice
once
in
a
mental
and
once
in
a
physical
context
as
i
have
tried
in
my
article
on
to
show
that
it
can
one
does
not
see
why
it
might
not
figure
thrice
or
four
times
or
any
number
of
times
by
running
into
as
many
different
mental
contexts
just
as
the
same
point
lying
at
their
intersection
can
be
continued
into
many
different
lines
abolishing
any
number
of
contexts
would
not
destroy
the
experience
itself
or
its
other
contexts
any
more
than
abolishing
some
of
the
point
linear
continuations
would
destroy
the
others
or
destroy
the
point
itself
i
well
know
the
subtle
dialectic
which
insists
that
a
term
taken
in
another
relation
must
needs
be
an
intrinsically
different
term
the
crux
is
always
the
old
greek
one
that
the
same
man
ca
be
tall
in
relation
to
one
neighbor
and
short
in
relation
to
another
for
that
would
make
him
tall
and
short
at
once
in
this
essay
i
can
not
stop
to
refute
this
dialectic
so
i
pass
on
leaving
my
flank
for
the
time
exposed
but
if
my
reader
will
only
allow
that
the
same
both
ends
his
past
and
begins
his
future
or
that
when
he
buys
an
acre
of
land
from
his
neighbor
it
is
the
same
acre
that
successively
figures
in
the
two
estates
or
that
when
i
pay
him
a
dollar
the
same
dollar
goes
into
his
pocket
that
came
out
of
mine
he
will
also
in
consistency
have
to
allow
that
the
same
object
may
conceivably
play
a
part
in
as
being
related
to
the
rest
of
any
number
of
otherwise
entirely
different
minds
this
is
enough
for
my
present
point
the
notion
of
minds
sharing
the
same
object
offers
no
special
logical
or
epistemological
difficulties
of
its
own
it
stands
or
falls
with
the
general
possibility
of
things
being
in
conjunctive
relation
with
other
things
at
all
in
principle
then
let
natural
realism
pass
for
possible
your
mind
and
mine
terminate
in
the
same
percept
not
merely
against
it
as
if
it
were
a
third
external
thing
but
by
inserting
themselves
into
it
and
coalescing
with
it
for
such
is
the
sort
of
conjunctive
union
that
appears
to
be
experienced
when
a
perceptual
terminus
even
so
two
hawsers
may
embrace
the
same
pile
and
yet
neither
one
of
them
touch
any
other
part
except
that
pile
of
what
the
other
hawser
is
attached
to
it
is
therefore
not
a
formal
question
but
a
question
of
empirical
fact
solely
whether
when
you
and
i
are
said
to
know
the
memorial
hall
our
minds
do
terminate
at
or
in
a
numerically
identical
percept
obviously
as
a
plain
matter
of
fact
they
do
apart
from
and
such
possibilities
we
see
the
hall
in
different
perspectives
you
may
be
on
one
side
of
it
and
i
on
another
the
percept
of
each
of
us
as
he
sees
the
surface
of
the
hall
is
moreover
only
his
provisional
terminus
the
next
thing
beyond
my
percept
is
not
your
mind
but
more
percepts
of
my
own
into
which
my
first
percept
develops
the
interior
of
the
hall
for
instance
or
the
inner
structure
of
its
bricks
and
mortar
if
our
minds
were
in
a
literal
sense
neither
could
get
beyond
the
percept
which
they
had
in
common
it
would
be
an
ultimate
barrier
between
them
unless
indeed
they
flowed
over
it
and
became
over
a
still
larger
part
of
their
content
which
apart
is
not
supposed
to
be
the
case
in
point
of
fact
the
ultimate
common
barrier
can
always
be
pushed
by
both
minds
farther
than
any
actual
percept
of
either
until
at
last
it
resolves
itself
into
the
mere
notion
of
imperceptibles
like
atoms
or
ether
so
that
where
we
do
terminate
in
percepts
our
knowledge
is
only
speciously
completed
being
in
theoretic
strictness
only
a
virtual
knowledge
of
those
remoter
objects
which
conception
carries
out
is
natural
realism
permissible
in
logic
refuted
then
by
empirical
fact
do
our
minds
have
no
object
in
common
after
all
yes
they
certainly
have
in
common
on
pragmatic
principles
we
are
obliged
to
predicate
sameness
wherever
we
can
predicate
no
assignable
point
of
difference
if
two
named
things
have
every
quality
and
function
indiscernible
and
are
at
the
same
time
in
the
same
place
they
must
be
written
down
as
numerically
one
thing
under
two
different
names
but
there
is
no
test
discoverable
so
far
as
i
know
by
which
it
can
be
shown
that
the
place
occupied
by
your
percept
of
memorial
hall
differs
from
the
place
occupied
by
mine
the
percepts
themselves
may
be
shown
to
differ
but
if
each
of
us
be
asked
to
point
out
where
his
percept
is
we
point
to
an
identical
spot
all
the
relations
whether
geometrical
or
causal
of
the
hall
originate
or
terminate
in
that
spot
wherein
our
hands
meet
and
where
each
of
us
begins
to
work
if
he
wishes
to
make
the
hall
change
before
the
other
eyes
just
so
it
is
with
our
bodies
that
body
of
yours
which
you
actuate
and
feel
from
within
must
be
in
the
same
spot
as
the
body
of
yours
which
i
see
or
touch
from
without
for
me
means
where
i
place
my
finger
if
you
do
not
feel
my
finger
contact
to
be
in
sense
when
i
place
it
on
your
body
where
then
do
you
feel
it
your
inner
actuations
of
your
body
meet
my
finger
it
is
that
you
resist
its
push
or
shrink
back
or
sweep
the
finger
aside
with
your
hand
whatever
farther
knowledge
either
of
us
may
acquire
of
the
real
constitution
of
the
body
which
we
thus
feel
you
from
within
and
i
from
without
it
is
in
that
same
place
that
the
newly
conceived
or
perceived
constituents
have
to
be
located
and
it
is
that
space
that
your
and
my
mental
intercourse
with
each
other
has
always
to
be
carried
on
by
the
mediation
of
impressions
which
i
convey
thither
and
of
the
reactions
thence
which
those
impressions
may
provoke
from
you
in
general
terms
then
whatever
differing
contents
our
minds
may
eventually
fill
a
place
with
the
place
itself
is
a
numerically
identical
content
of
the
two
minds
a
piece
of
common
property
in
which
through
which
and
over
which
they
join
the
receptacle
of
certain
of
our
experiences
being
thus
common
the
experiences
themselves
might
some
day
become
common
also
if
that
day
ever
did
come
our
thoughts
would
terminate
in
a
complete
empirical
identity
there
would
be
an
end
so
far
as
experiences
went
to
our
discussions
about
truth
no
points
of
difference
appearing
they
would
have
to
count
as
the
same
vii
conclusion
with
this
we
have
the
outlines
of
a
philosophy
of
pure
experience
before
us
at
the
outset
of
my
essay
i
called
it
a
mosaic
philosophy
in
actual
mosaics
the
pieces
are
held
together
by
their
bedding
for
which
bedding
the
substances
transcendental
egos
or
absolutes
of
other
philosophies
may
be
taken
to
stand
in
radical
empiricism
there
is
no
bedding
it
is
as
if
the
pieces
clung
together
by
their
edges
the
transitions
experienced
between
them
forming
their
cement
of
course
such
a
metaphor
is
misleading
for
in
actual
experience
the
more
substantive
and
the
more
transitive
parts
run
into
each
other
continuously
there
is
in
general
no
separateness
needing
to
be
overcome
by
an
external
cement
and
whatever
separateness
is
actually
experienced
is
not
overcome
it
stays
and
counts
as
separateness
to
the
end
but
the
metaphor
serves
to
symbolize
the
fact
that
experience
itself
taken
at
large
can
grow
by
its
edges
that
one
moment
of
it
proliferates
into
the
next
by
transitions
which
whether
conjunctive
or
disjunctive
continue
the
experiential
tissue
can
not
i
contend
be
denied
life
is
in
the
transitions
as
much
as
in
the
terms
connected
often
indeed
it
seems
to
be
there
more
emphatically
as
if
our
spurts
and
sallies
forward
were
the
real
of
the
battle
were
like
the
thin
line
of
flame
advancing
across
the
dry
autumnal
field
which
the
farmer
proceeds
to
burn
in
this
line
we
live
prospectively
as
well
as
retrospectively
it
is
the
past
inasmuch
as
it
comes
expressly
as
the
past
continuation
it
is
the
future
in
so
far
as
the
future
when
it
comes
will
have
continued
these
relations
of
continuous
transition
experienced
are
what
make
our
experiences
cognitive
in
the
simplest
and
completest
cases
the
experiences
are
cognitive
of
one
another
when
one
of
them
terminates
a
previous
series
of
them
with
a
sense
of
fulfilment
it
we
say
is
what
those
other
experiences
in
view
the
knowledge
in
such
a
case
is
verified
the
truth
is
down
mainly
however
we
live
on
speculative
investments
or
on
our
prospects
only
but
living
on
things
is
as
good
as
living
in
the
actual
so
long
as
our
credit
remains
good
it
is
evident
that
for
the
most
part
it
is
good
and
that
the
universe
seldom
protests
our
drafts
in
this
sense
we
at
every
moment
can
continue
to
believe
in
an
existing
it
is
only
in
special
cases
that
our
confident
rush
forward
gets
rebuked
the
beyond
must
of
course
always
in
our
philosophy
be
itself
of
an
experiential
nature
if
not
a
future
experience
of
our
own
or
a
present
one
of
our
neighbor
it
must
be
a
thing
in
itself
in
dr
prince
and
professor
strong
sense
of
the
term
that
is
it
must
be
an
experience
itself
whose
relation
to
other
things
we
translate
into
the
action
of
molecules
or
whatever
else
the
physical
symbols
may
be
this
opens
the
chapter
of
the
relations
of
radical
empiricism
to
panpsychism
into
which
i
can
not
enter
now
the
beyond
can
in
any
case
exist
simultaneously
for
it
can
be
experienced
have
simultaneously
with
the
experience
that
practically
postulates
it
by
looking
in
its
direction
or
by
turning
or
changing
in
the
direction
of
which
it
is
the
goal
pending
that
actuality
of
union
in
the
virtuality
of
which
the
even
now
of
the
postulation
consists
the
beyond
and
its
knower
are
entities
split
off
from
each
other
the
world
is
in
so
far
forth
a
pluralism
of
which
the
unity
is
not
fully
experienced
as
yet
but
as
fast
as
verifications
come
trains
of
experience
once
separate
run
into
one
another
and
that
is
why
i
said
earlier
in
my
article
that
the
unity
of
the
world
is
on
the
whole
undergoing
increase
the
universe
continually
grows
in
quantity
by
new
experiences
that
graft
themselves
upon
the
older
mass
but
these
very
new
experiences
often
help
the
mass
to
a
more
consolidated
form
these
are
the
main
features
of
a
philosophy
of
pure
experience
it
has
innumerable
other
aspects
and
arouses
innumerable
questions
but
the
points
i
have
touched
on
seem
enough
to
make
an
entering
wedge
in
my
own
mind
such
a
philosophy
harmonizes
best
with
a
radical
pluralism
with
novelty
and
indeterminism
moralism
and
theism
and
with
the
lately
sprung
upon
us
by
the
oxford
and
the
chicago
schools
i
can
not
however
be
sure
that
all
these
doctrines
are
its
necessary
and
indispensable
allies
it
presents
so
many
points
of
difference
both
from
the
common
sense
and
from
the
idealism
that
have
made
our
philosophic
language
that
it
is
almost
as
difficult
to
state
it
as
it
is
to
think
it
out
clearly
and
if
it
is
ever
to
grow
into
a
respectable
system
it
will
have
to
be
built
up
by
the
contributions
of
many
minds
it
seems
to
me
as
i
said
at
the
outset
of
this
essay
that
many
minds
are
in
point
of
fact
now
turning
in
a
direction
that
points
towards
radical
empiricism
if
they
are
carried
farther
by
my
words
and
if
then
they
add
their
stronger
voices
to
my
feebler
one

our

world

us

and

no

its
difficulties
are
disappointments
and

they
are
not
intellectual
contradictions
when
the
reflective
intellect
gets
at
work
however
it
discovers
incomprehensibilities
in
the
flowing
process
distinguishing
its
elements
and

it
gives
them
separate
names

what
it
thus
disjoins

elaboration
other

try
some
by
ignoring
some
by
resisting
and
some
by
turning
the
dialectic
procedure
against
itself
negating
its
first
negations
to
restore
the
fluent
sense
of
life
again
and
let
redemption
take
the
place
of
innocence

perfection
with
which
any

may
do

of

human
success
and
of
its
importance

history

last
essay
world
of
pure
experience
i
tried
my
own
hand
sketchily
at
the
problem
resisting
certain
first
steps
of
dialectics
by
insisting
in
a
general
way
that
the
immediately
experienced
conjunctive
relations
are
as
real
as
anything
else
if
my
sketch
is
not
to
appear
too
i
must
come
closer
to
details
and
in
the
present
essay
i
propose
to
do
so
i
experience
is
the
name
which
i
gave
to
the
immediate
flux
of
life
which
furnishes
the
material
to
our
later
reflection
with
its
conceptual
categories
only
babes
or
men
in
from
sleep
drugs
illnesses
or
blows
may
be
assumed
to
have
an
experience
pure
in
the
literal
sense
of
a
which
is
not
yet
any
definite
ready
to
be
all
sorts
of
whats
full
both
of
oneness
and
of
manyness
but
in
respects
that
do
appear
changing
throughout
yet
so
confusedly
that
its
phases
interpenetrate
and
no
points
either
of
distinction
or
of
identity
can
be
caught
pure
experience
in
this
state
is
but
another
name
for
feeling
or
sensation
but
the
flux
of
it
no
sooner
comes
than
it
tends
to
fill
itself
with
emphases
and
these
salient
parts
become
identified
and
fixed
and
abstracted
so
that
experience
now
flows
as
if
shot
through
with
adjectives
and
nouns
and
prepositions
and
conjunctions
its
purity
is
only
a
relative
term
meaning
the
proportional
amount
of
unverbalized
sensation
which
it
still
embodies
far
back
as
we
go
the
flux
both
as
a
whole
and
in
its
parts
is
that
of
things
conjunct
and
separated
the
great
continua
of
time
space
and
the
self
envelope
everything
betwixt
them
and
flow
together
without
interfering
the
things
that
they
envelope
come
as
separate
in
some
ways
and
as
continuous
in
others
some
sensations
coalesce
with
some
ideas
and
others
are
irreconcilable
qualities
compenetrate
one
space
or
exclude
each
other
from
it
they
cling
together
persistently
in
groups
that
move
as
units
or
else
they
separate
their
changes
are
abrupt
or
discontinuous
and
their
kinds
resemble
or
differ
and
as
they
do
so
they
fall
into
either
even
or
irregular
series
in
all
this
the
continuities
and
the
discontinuities
are
absolutely
matters
of
immediate
feeling
the
conjunctions
are
as
primordial
elements
of
as
are
the
distinctions
and
disjunctions
in
the
same
act
by
which
i
feel
that
this
passing
minute
is
a
new
pulse
of
my
life
i
feel
that
the
old
life
continues
into
it
and
the
feeling
of
continuance
in
no
wise
jars
upon
the
simultaneous
feeling
of
a
novelty
they
too
compenetrate
harmoniously
prepositions
copulas
and
conjunctions
flower
out
of
the
stream
of
pure
experience
the
stream
of
concretes
or
the
sensational
stream
as
naturally
as
nouns
and
adjectives
do
and
they
melt
into
it
again
as
fluidly
when
we
apply
them
to
a
new
portion
of
the
stream
ii
if
now
we
ask
why
we
must
thus
translate
experience
from
a
more
concrete
or
pure
into
a
more
intellectualized
form
filling
it
with
ever
more
abounding
conceptual
distinctions
rationalism
and
naturalism
give
different
replies
the
rationalistic
answer
is
that
the
theoretic
life
is
absolute
and
its
interests
imperative
that
to
understand
is
simply
the
duty
of
man
and
that
who
questions
this
need
not
be
argued
with
for
by
the
fact
of
arguing
he
gives
away
his
case
the
naturalist
answer
is
that
the
environment
kills
as
well
as
sustains
us
and
that
the
tendency
of
raw
experience
to
extinguish
the
experient
himself
is
lessened
just
in
the
degree
in
which
the
elements
in
it
that
have
a
practical
bearing
upon
life
are
analyzed
out
of
the
continuum
and
verbally
fixed
and
coupled
together
so
that
we
may
know
what
is
in
the
wind
for
us
and
get
ready
to
react
in
time
had
pure
experience
the
naturalist
says
been
always
perfectly
healthy
there
would
never
have
arisen
the
necessity
of
isolating
or
verbalizing
any
of
its
terms
we
should
just
have
experienced
inarticulately
and
unintellectually
enjoyed
this
leaning
on
in
the
naturalist
account
implies
that
whenever
we
intellectualize
a
relatively
pure
experience
we
ought
to
do
so
for
the
sake
of
redescending
to
the
purer
or
more
concrete
level
again
and
that
if
an
intellect
stays
aloft
among
its
abstract
terms
and
generalized
relations
and
does
not
reinsert
itself
with
its
conclusions
into
some
particular
point
of
the
immediate
stream
of
life
it
fails
to
finish
out
its
function
and
leaves
its
normal
race
unrun
most
rationalists
nowadays
will
agree
that
naturalism
gives
a
true
enough
account
of
the
way
in
which
our
intellect
arose
at
first
but
they
will
deny
these
latter
implications
the
case
they
will
say
resembles
that
of
sexual
love
originating
in
the
animal
need
of
getting
another
generation
born
this
passion
has
developed
secondarily
such
imperious
spiritual
needs
that
if
you
ask
why
another
generation
ought
to
be
born
at
all
the
answer
is
that
love
may
go
on
just
so
with
our
intellect
it
originated
as
a
practical
means
of
serving
life
but
it
has
developed
incidentally
the
function
of
understanding
absolute
truth
and
life
itself
now
seems
to
be
given
chiefly
as
a
means
by
which
that
function
may
be
prosecuted
but
truth
and
the
understanding
of
it
lie
among
the
abstracts
and
universals
so
the
intellect
now
carries
on
its
higher
business
wholly
in
this
region
without
any
need
of
redescending
into
pure
experience
again
if
the
contrasted
tendencies
which
i
thus
designate
as
naturalistic
and
rationalistic
are
not
recognized
by
the
reader
perhaps
an
example
will
make
them
more
concrete
bradley
for
instance
is
an
he
admits
that
our
intellect
is
primarily
practical
but
says
that
for
philosophers
the
practical
need
is
simply
truth
truth
moreover
must
be
assumed
immediate
experience
has
to
be
broken
into
subjects
and
qualities
terms
and
relations
to
be
understood
as
truth
at
all
yet
when
so
broken
it
is
less
consistent
than
ever
taken
raw
it
is
all
intellectualized
it
is
all
distinction
without
oneness
an
arrangement
may
but
the
theoretic
problem
is
not
solved
the
question
is
the
diversity
can
exist
in
harmony
with
the
oneness
to
go
back
to
pure
experience
is
unavailing
feeling
gives
no
answer
to
our
riddle
even
if
your
intuition
is
a
fact
it
is
not
an
is
a
mere
experience
and
furnishes
no
consistent
view
the
experience
offered
as
facts
or
truths
find
that
my
intellect
rejects
because
they
contradict
themselves
they
offer
a
complex
of
diversities
conjoined
in
a
way
which
it
feels
is
not
its
way
and
which
it
can
not
repeat
as
its
own
for
to
be
satisfied
my
intellect
must
understand
and
it
can
not
understand
by
taking
a
congeries
in
the
lump
so
bradley
in
the
sole
interests
of
as
he
conceives
that
function
turns
his
back
on
finite
experience
forever
truth
must
lie
in
the
opposite
direction
the
direction
of
the
absolute
and
this
kind
of
rationalism
and
naturalism
or
as
i
will
now
call
it
pragmatism
walk
thenceforward
upon
opposite
paths
for
the
one
those
intellectual
products
are
most
true
which
turning
their
face
towards
the
absolute
come
nearest
to
symbolizing
its
ways
of
uniting
the
many
and
the
one
for
the
other
those
are
most
true
which
most
successfully
dip
back
into
the
finite
stream
of
feeling
and
grow
most
easily
confluent
with
some
particular
wave
or
wavelet
such
confluence
not
only
proves
the
intellectual
operation
to
have
been
true
as
an
addition
may
that
a
subtraction
is
already
rightly
performed
but
it
constitutes
according
to
pragmatism
all
that
we
mean
by
calling
it
true
only
in
so
far
as
they
lead
us
successfully
or
unsuccessfully
back
into
sensible
experience
again
are
our
abstracts
and
universals
true
or
false
at
all
iii
in
section
vi
of
the
last
essay
i
adopted
in
a
general
way
the
belief
that
one
and
the
same
world
is
cognized
by
our
different
minds
but
i
left
undiscussed
the
dialectical
arguments
which
maintain
that
this
is
logically
absurd
the
usual
reason
given
for
its
being
absurd
is
that
it
assumes
one
object
to
wit
the
world
to
stand
in
two
relations
at
once
to
my
mind
namely
and
again
to
yours
whereas
a
term
taken
in
a
second
relation
can
not
logically
be
the
same
term
which
it
was
at
first
i
have
heard
this
reason
urged
so
often
in
discussing
with
absolutists
and
it
would
destroy
my
radical
empiricism
so
utterly
if
it
were
valid
that
i
am
bound
to
give
it
an
attentive
ear
and
seriously
to
search
its
strength
for
instance
let
the
matter
in
dispute
be
term
asserted
to
be
on
the
one
hand
related
to
and
on
the
other
to
and
let
the
two
cases
of
relation
be
symbolized
by
and
respectively
when
now
i
assume
that
the
experience
may
immediately
come
and
be
given
in
the
shape
m
with
no
trace
of
doubling
or
internal
fission
in
the
i
am
told
that
this
is
all
a
popular
delusion
that
m
logically
means
two
different
experiences
and
namely
and
that
although
the
absolute
may
and
indeed
must
from
its
superior
point
of
view
read
its
own
kind
of
unity
into
two
editions
yet
as
elements
in
finite
experience
the
two
lie
irretrievably
asunder
and
the
world
between
them
is
broken
and
unbridged
in
arguing
this
dialectic
thesis
one
must
avoid
slipping
from
the
logical
into
the
physical
point
of
view
it
would
be
easy
in
taking
a
concrete
example
to
fix
one
ideas
by
to
choose
one
in
which
the
letter
should
stand
for
a
collective
noun
of
some
sort
which
noun
being
related
to
by
one
of
its
parts
and
to
by
another
would
inwardly
be
two
things
when
it
stood
outwardly
in
both
relations
thus
one
might
say
hume
who
weighed
so
many
stone
by
his
body
influences
posterity
by
his
doctrine
the
body
and
the
doctrine
are
two
things
between
which
our
finite
minds
can
discover
no
real
sameness
though
the
same
name
covers
both
of
them
and
then
one
might
continue
an
absolute
is
capable
of
uniting
such
a
we
must
i
say
avoid
this
sort
of
example
for
the
dialectic
insight
if
true
at
all
must
apply
to
terms
and
relations
universally
it
must
be
true
of
abstract
units
as
well
as
of
nouns
collective
and
if
we
prove
it
by
concrete
examples
we
must
take
the
simplest
so
as
to
avoid
irrelevant
material
suggestions
taken
thus
in
all
its
generality
the
absolutist
contention
seems
to
use
as
its
major
premise
hume
notion
all
our
distinct
perceptions
are
distinct
existences
and
that
the
mind
never
perceives
any
real
connexion
among
distinct
existences
undoubtedly
since
we
use
two
phrases
in
talking
first
about
relation
to
and
then
about
relation
to
we
must
be
having
or
must
have
had
two
distinct
perceptions
and
the
rest
would
then
seem
to
follow
duly
but
the
of
the
reasoning
here
seems
to
be
the
fact
of
the
two
and
this
suggests
that
the
argument
may
be
merely
verbal
can
it
be
that
the
whole
dialectic
consists
in
attributing
to
the
experience
a
constitution
similar
to
that
of
the
language
in
which
we
describe
it
must
we
assert
the
objective
of
the
merely
because
we
have
to
name
it
twice
over
when
we
name
its
two
relations
candidly
i
can
think
of
no
other
reason
than
this
for
the
dialectic
conclusion
for
if
we
think
not
of
our
words
but
of
any
simple
concrete
matter
which
they
may
be
held
to
signify
the
experience
itself
belies
the
paradox
asserted
we
use
indeed
two
separate
concepts
in
analyzing
our
object
but
we
know
them
all
the
while
to
be
but
substitutional
and
that
the
in
and
the
in
n
are
capable
of
leading
to
and
terminating
in
one
piece
of
sensible
experience
this
persistent
identity
of
certain
units
or
emphases
or
points
or
objects
or
members
call
them
what
you
will
of
the
is
just
one
of
those
conjunctive
features
of
it
on
which
i
am
obliged
to
insist
so
emphatically
for
samenesses
are
parts
of
experience
indefeasible
structure
when
i
hear
a
and
as
life
flows
on
its
after
image
dies
away
i
still
hark
back
to
it
as
same
when
i
see
a
thing
with
to
the
left
of
it
and
to
the
right
of
it
i
see
it
one
and
if
you
tell
me
i
have
had
to
it
twice
i
reply
that
if
i
it
a
thousand
times
i
should
still
it
as
a
unit
its
unity
is
aboriginal
just
as
the
multiplicity
of
my
successive
takings
is
aboriginal
it
comes
unbroken
as
as
a
singular
which
i
encounter
they
come
broken
as
takings
as
my
plurality
of
operations
the
unity
and
the
separateness
are
strictly
i
do
not
easily
fathom
why
my
opponents
should
find
the
separateness
so
much
more
easily
understandable
that
they
must
needs
infect
the
whole
of
finite
experience
with
it
and
relegate
the
unity
now
taken
as
a
bare
postulate
and
no
longer
as
a
thing
positively
perceivable
to
the
region
of
the
absolute
mysteries
i
do
not
easily
fathom
this
i
say
for
the
said
opponents
are
above
mere
verbal
quibbling
yet
all
that
i
can
catch
in
their
talk
is
the
substitution
of
what
is
true
of
certain
words
for
what
is
true
of
what
they
signify
they
stay
with
the
words
not
returning
to
the
stream
of
life
whence
all
the
meaning
of
them
came
and
which
is
always
ready
to
reabsorb
them
iv
for
aught
this
argument
proves
then
we
may
continue
to
believe
that
one
thing
can
be
known
by
many
knowers
but
the
denial
of
one
thing
in
many
relations
is
but
one
application
of
a
still
profounder
dialectic
difficulty
man

the
sophists
for

good
and
hegel
and
herbart
in
their
day
more
recently
spir
and
most
recently
and
elaborately
of
all
bradley
informs
us
that
a
term
can
logically
only
be
a
punctiform
unit
and
that
not
one
of
the
conjunctive
relations
between
things
which
experience
seems
to
yield
is
rationally
possible
of
course
if
true
this
cuts
off
radical
empiricism
without
even
a
shilling
radical
empiricism
takes
conjunctive
relations
at
their
face
value
holding
them
to
be
as
real
as
the
terms
united
by
them
the
world
it
represents
as
a
collection
some
parts
of
which
are
conjunctively
and
others
disjunctively
related
two
parts
themselves
disjoined
may
nevertheless
hang
together
by
intermediaries
with
which
they
are
severally
connected
and
the
whole
world
eventually
may
hang
together
similarly
inasmuch
as
path
of
conjunctive
transition
by
which
to
pass
from
one
of
its
parts
to
another
may
always
be
discernible
such
determinately
various
may
be
called
union
to
distinguish
it
from
the
type
of
union
in
all
and
all
in
each
union
of
as
one
might
call
it
which
monistic
systems
hold
to
obtain
when
things
are
taken
in
their
absolute
reality
in
a
concatenated
world
a
partial
conflux
often
is
experienced
our
concepts
and
our
sensations
are
confluent
successive
states
of
the
same
ego
and
feelings
of
the
same
body
are
confluent
where
the
experience
is
not
of
conflux
it
may
be
of
conterminousness
things
with
but
one
thing
between
or
of
contiguousness
nothing
between
or
of
likeness
or
of
nearness
or
of
simultaneousness
or
of
or
of
or
of
or
of
simple
or
even
of
mere
which
last
relation
would
make
of
however
disjointed
a
world
otherwise
at
any
rate
for
that
occasion
a
universe
discourse
now
bradley
tells
us
that
none
of
these
relations
as
we
actually
experience
them
can
possibly
be
real
my
next
duty
accordingly
must
be
to
rescue
radical
empiricism
from
bradley
fortunately
as
it
seems
to
me
his
general
contention
that
the
very
notion
of
relation
is
unthinkable
clearly
has
been
successfully
met
by
many
critics
it
is
a
burden
to
the
flesh
and
an
injustice
both
to
readers
and
to
the
previous
writers
to
repeat
good
arguments
already
printed
so
in
noticing
bradley
i
will
confine
myself
to
the
interests
of
radical
empiricism
solely
v
the
first
duty
of
radical
empiricism
taking
given
conjunctions
at
their
is
to
class
some
of
them
as
more
intimate
and
some
as
more
external
when
two
terms
are
their
very
natures
enter
into
the
relation
being
they
are
no
matter
where
or
when
the
likeness
never
can
be
denied
if
asserted
it
continues
predicable
as
long
as
the
terms
continue
other
relations
the
and
the
for
example
seem
adventitious
the
sheet
of
paper
may
be
or
the
table
for
example
and
in
either
case
the
relation
involves
only
the
outside
of
its
terms
having
an
outside
both
of
them
they
contribute
by
it
to
the
relation
it
is
external
the
term
inner
nature
is
irrelevant
to
it
any
book
any
table
may
fall
into
the
relation
which
is
created
hac
not
by
their
existence
but
by
their
casual
situation
it
is
just
because
so
many
of
the
conjunctions
of
experience
seem
so
external
that
a
philosophy
of
pure
experience
must
tend
to
pluralism
in
its
ontology
so
far
as
things
have
for
example
we
are
free
to
imagine
them
with
different
origins
even
if
they
could
get
to
and
get
into
space
at
all
then
they
may
have
done
so
separately
once
there
however
they
are
to
one
another
and
with
no
prejudice
to
their
natures
all
sorts
of
may
supervene
between
them
the
question
of
how
things
could
come
to
be
anyhow
is
wholly
different
from
the
question
what
their
relations
once
the
being
accomplished
may
consist
in
bradley
now
affirms
that
such
external
relations
as
the
which
we
here
talk
of
must
hold
of
entirely
different
subjects
from
those
of
which
the
absence
of
such
relations
might
a
moment
previously
have
been
plausibly
asserted
not
only
is
the
different
when
the
book
is
on
the
table
but
the
is
different
as
a
book
from
what
it
was
when
it
was
off
the
table
he
admits
that
such
external
relations
seem
possible
and
even
existing
that
you
do
not
alter
what
you
compare
or
rearrange
in
space
seems
to
common
sense
quite
obvious
and
that
on
the
other
side
there
are
as
obvious
difficulties
does
not
occur
to
common
sense
at
all
and
i
will
begin
by
pointing
out
these
difficulties
there
is
a
relation
in
the
result
and
this
relation
we
hear
is
to
make
no
difference
in
its
terms
but
if
so
to
what
does
it
make
a
difference
it
make
a
difference
to
us
onlookers
at
least
and
what
is
the
meaning
and
sense
of
qualifying
the
terms
by
it
the
meaning
is
to
tell
the
truth
about
their
relative
if
in
short
it
is
external
to
the
terms
how
can
it
possibly
be
true
of
them
it
the
suggested
by
the
little
word
here
which
i
have
underscored
that
is
the
root
of
bradley
trouble
if
the
terms
from
their
inner
nature
do
not
enter
into
the
relation
then
so
far
as
they
are
concerned
they
seem
related
for
no
reason
at
all
things
are
spatially
related
first
in
one
way
and
then
become
related
in
another
way
and
yet
in
no
way
themselves
are
altered
for
the
relations
it
is
said
are
but
external
but
i
reply
that
if
so
i
can
not
the
leaving
by
the
terms
of
one
set
of
relations
and
their
adoption
of
another
fresh
set
the
process
and
its
result
to
the
terms
if
they
contribute
nothing
to
it
they
contribute
to
it
all
there
is
it
seem
irrational
throughout
here
means
simply
or
nondeductible
from
the
essence
of
either
term
singly
it
is
no
reproach
if
it
means
such
essence
bradley
should
show
wherein
and
but
if
they
contribute
anything
they
must
surely
be
affected
internally
so
if
they
contribute
only
their
surface
in
such
relations
as
foot
away
only
surfaces
are
in
if
the
terms
contribute
anything
whatever
then
the
terms
are
affected
altered
by
the
arrangement
that
for
working
purposes
we
treat
and
do
well
to
treat
some
relations
as
external
merely
i
do
not
deny
and
that
of
course
is
not
the
question
at
issue
here
that
question
is
whether
in
the
end
and
in
principle
a
mere
external
relation
a
relation
which
can
change
without
forcing
its
terms
to
change
their
nature
is
possible
and
forced
on
us
by
the
facts
bradley
next
reverts
to
the
antinomies
of
space
which
according
to
him
prove
it
to
be
unreal
although
it
appears
as
so
prolific
a
medium
of
external
relations
and
he
then
concludes
that
irrationality
and
externality
can
not
be
the
last
truth
about
things
somewhere
there
must
be
a
reason
why
this
and
that
appear
together
and
this
reason
and
reality
must
reside
in
the
whole
from
which
terms
and
relations
are
abstractions
a
whole
in
which
their
internal
connection
must
lie
and
out
of
which
from
the
background
appear
those
fresh
results
which
never
could
have
come
from
the
premises
and
he
adds
that
where
the
whole
is
different
the
terms
that
qualify
and
contribute
to
it
must
so
far
be
different
they
are
altered
so
far
only
far
farther
than
externally
yet
not
through
and
through
but
still
they
are
altered
i
must
insist
that
in
each
case
the
terms
are
qualified
by
their
whole
how
do
their
external
relations
situations
dates
changed
as
these
are
in
the
new
whole
fail
to
qualify
them
enough
and
that
in
the
second
case
there
is
a
whole
which
differs
both
logically
and
psychologically
from
the
first
whole
and
i
urge
that
in
contributing
to
the
change
the
terms
so
far
are
altered
not
merely
the
relations
then
but
the
terms
are
altered
far
but
just
far
is
the
whole
problem
and
would
seem
in
spite
of
bradley
somewhat
undecided
utterances
to
be
the
full
bradleyan
answer
the
which
he
here
treats
as
primary
and
determinative
of
each
part
manner
of
simply
when
it
alters
alter
in
its
entirety
there
be
total
conflux
of
its
parts
each
into
and
through
each
other
the
appears
here
as
a
as
an
of
absolutistically
tempered
for
he
candidly
confesses
that
how
the
parts
differ
as
they
contribute
to
different
wholes
is
unknown
to
him
although
i
have
every
wish
to
comprehend
the
authority
by
which
bradley
understanding
speaks
his
words
leave
me
wholly
unconverted
relations
stand
with
their
withers
all
unwrung
and
remain
for
aught
he
proves
to
the
contrary
not
only
practically
workable
but
also
perfectly
intelligible
factors
of
reality
vi
bradley
understanding
shows
the
most
extraordinary
power
of
perceiving
separations
and
the
most
extraordinary
impotence
in
comprehending
conjunctions
one
would
naturally
say
or
both
but
not
so
bradley
when
a
common
man
analyzes
certain
from
out
the
stream
of
experience
he
understands
their
distinctness
thus
but
this
does
not
prevent
him
from
equally
well
understanding
their
combination
with
each
other
originally
experienced
in
the
or
their
confluence
with
new
sensible
experiences
in
which
they
recur
as
same
returning
into
the
stream
of
sensible
presentation
nouns
and
adjectives
and
and
abstract
grow
confluent
again
and
the
word
names
all
these
experiences
of
conjunction
bradley
understands
the
isolation
of
the
abstracts
but
to
understand
the
combination
is
to
him
impossible
to
understand
a
complex
he
says
i
must
begin
with
or
and
beginning
say
with
if
i
then
merely
find
i
have
either
lost
or
i
have
got
beside
word
seems
here
vital
as
meaning
a
conjunction
and
therefore
something
else
and
in
neither
case
have
i
understood
for
my
intellect
can
not
simply
unite
a
diversity
nor
has
it
in
itself
any
form
or
way
of
togetherness
and
you
gain
nothing
if
beside
and
you
offer
me
their
conjunction
in
fact
for
to
my
intellect
that
is
no
more
than
another
external
element
and
once
for
all
are
for
my
intellect
not
true
unless
they
satisfy
it
the
intellect
has
in
its
nature
no
principle
of
mere
togetherness
of
course
bradley
has
a
right
to
define
as
the
power
by
which
we
perceive
separations
but
not
unions
provided
he
give
due
notice
to
the
reader
but
why
then
claim
that
such
a
maimed
and
amputated
power
must
reign
supreme
in
philosophy
and
accuse
on
its
behoof
the
whole
empirical
world
of
irrationality
it
is
true
that
he
elsewhere
attributes
to
the
intellect
a
of
transition
but
says
that
when
he
looks
for
transitions
in
the
detail
of
living
experience
he
unable
to
verify
such
a
solution
yet
he
never
explains
what
the
intellectual
transitions
would
be
like
in
case
we
had
them
he
only
defines
them
negatively
they
are
not
spatial
temporal
predicative
or
causal
or
qualitatively
or
otherwise
serial
or
in
any
way
relational
as
we
naïvely
trace
relations
for
relations
terms
and
need
themselves
to
be
hooked
on
the
nearest
approach
he
makes
to
describing
a
truly
intellectual
transition
is
where
he
speaks
of
and
as
being
each
from
its
own
nature
in
a
whole
which
is
the
nature
of
both
alike
but
this
which
bradley
seems
exquisitely
analogous
to
a
congeries
in
a
if
not
to
suggests
nothing
but
that
which
pure
experience
so
abundantly
offers
as
when
and
are
confluent
in
a
of
sugar
or
kinesthetic
dermal
and
optical
sensations
confluent
in
hand
all
that
i
can
verify
in
the
transitions
which
bradley
intellect
desiderates
as
its
is
a
reminiscence
of
these
and
other
sensible
conjunctions
especially
but
a
reminiscence
so
vague
that
its
originals
are
not
recognized
bradley
in
short
repeats
the
fable
of
the
dog
the
bone
and
its
image
in
the
water
with
a
world
of
particulars
given
in
loveliest
union
in
conjunction
definitely
various
and
variously
definite
the
of
which
you
as
soon
as
you
see
the
fact
of
them
for
there
is
no
except
the
constitution
of
the
fact
as
given
with
all
this
given
him
i
say
in
pure
experience
he
asks
for
some
ineffable
union
in
the
abstract
instead
which
if
he
gained
it
would
only
be
a
duplicate
of
what
he
has
already
in
his
full
possession
surely
he
abuses
the
privilege
which
society
grants
to
all
us
philosophers
of
being
polemic
writing
like
this
is
odious
but
with
absolutism
in
possession
in
so
many
quarters
omission
to
defend
my
radical
empiricism
against
its
best
known
champion
would
count
as
either
superficiality
or
inability
i
have
to
conclude
that
its
dialectic
has
not
invalidated
in
the
least
degree
the
usual
conjunctions
by
which
the
world
as
experienced
hangs
so
variously
together
in
particular
it
leaves
an
empirical
theory
of
knowledge
intact
and
lets
us
continue
to
believe
with
common
sense
that
one
object
be
known
if
we
have
any
ground
for
thinking
that
it
known
to
many
knowers
in
the
next
essay
i
shall
return
to
this
last
supposition
which
seems
to
me
to
offer
other
difficulties
much
harder
for
a
philosophy
of
pure
experience
to
deal
with
than
any
of
absolutism
dialectic
objections

the
reader
must
beware
of
slipping
from
logical
into
phenomenal
considerations
it
may
well
be
that
we
a
certain
relation
falsely
because
the
circumstances
of
the
case
being
complex
have
deceived
us
at
a
railway
station

train

not

that
fills

here
put
motion
in
the
wrong
place
in
the
world
but
in
its
original
place
the
motion
is
a
part
of
reality
what
bradley
means
is
nothing
like
this
but
rather
that
such
things
as
motion
are
nowhere
real
and
that
even
in
their
aboriginal

incorrigible

such

phenomena
are

point

whether

hold

not

the
substitution
for

begs
the
whole
question

there

peevishly
on
and

so

in

such
a
question
may
be
left
unanswered
and
second
edition
pp
i
say
because
apart
from
the
far
which
sounds
terribly
there
are
passages
in
these
very
pages
in
which
bradley
admits
the
pluralistic
thesis
read
for
example
what
he
says
on
of
a
billiard
ball
keeping
its
unchanged
though
in
its
change
of
place
its
gets
altered
or
what
he
says
on
of
the
possibility
that
an
abstract
quality
a
b
or
c
in
a
thing
throughout
remain
unchanged
although
the
thing
be
altered
or
his
admission
that
in
both
as
analyzed
out
of
a
man
and
when
given
with
the
rest
of
him
there
may
be
change
why
does
he
immediately
add
that
for
the
pluralist
to
plead
the
of
such
abstractions
would
be
an
it
is
impossible
to
admit
it
to
be
such
the
entire
and
inquest
is
just
as
to
whether
parts
which
you
can
abstract
from
existing
wholes
can
also
contribute
to
other
wholes
without
changing
their
inner
nature
if
they
can
thus
mould
various
wholes
into
new
then
it
follows
that
the
same
elements
are
logically
able
to
exist
in
different
wholes
whether
physically
able
would
depend
on
additional
hypotheses
that
partial
changes
are
thinkable
and
change
not
a
dialectic
necessity
that
monism
is
only
an
hypothesis
and
that
an
additively
constituted
universe
is
a
rationally
respectable
hypothesis
also
all
the
theses
of
radical
empiricism
in
short
follow
pp
so
far
as
i
catch
his
state
of
mind
it
is
somewhat
like
this
how
does
the
existence
of
these
three
abstract
elements
result
in
book
being
livingly
on
table
why
the
table
on
the
book
or
why
does
the
connect
itself
with
another
book
or
something
that
is
not
a
table
must
something
each
of
the
three
elements
already
determine
the
two
others
to
so
that
they
do
not
settle
elsewhere
or
float
vaguely
must
the
fact
be
in
each
and
exist
before
it
can
exist
but
if
so
in
what
can
the
jural
existence
consist
if
not
in
a
spiritual
miniature
of
the
whole
fact
constitution
actuating
every
partial
factor
as
its
purpose
but
is
this
anything
but
the
old
metaphysical
fallacy
of
looking
behind
a
fact
for
the
ground
of
the
fact
and
finding
it
in
the
shape
of
the
very
same
fact
somewhere
we
must
leave
off
with
a
behind
which
there
is
nothing
apply
this
to
the
case
of
j
pp
pp
how
meaningless
is
the
contention
that
in
such
wholes
or
in
etc
the
relation
is
an
additional
entity
the
terms
needing
itself
to
be
related
again
to
each
both
bradley
pp
and
royce
world
and
the
vol
i
lovingly
repeat
this
piece
of
profundity
the
and
the
are
entirely
other
questions
not
under
discussion
as
i
understand
bradley
not
how
experience
gets
itself
born
but
how
it
can
be
what
it
is
after
it
is
born
is
the
puzzle
above
iv
how
two
minds
can
know
one
thing
in
the
essay
entitled
consciousness
exist
i
have
tried
to
show
that
when
we
call
an
experience
that
does
not
mean
that
it
is
suffused
throughout
with
a
peculiar
modality
of
being
being
as
stained
glass
may
be
suffused
with
light
but
rather
that
it
stands
in
certain
determinate
relations
to
other
portions
of
experience
extraneous
to
itself
these
form
one
peculiar
for
it
while
taken
in
another
context
of
experiences
we
class
it
as
a
fact
in
the
physical
world
this
for
example
is
in
the
first
instance
a
bald
a
datum
fact
phenomenon
content
or
whatever
other
neutral
or
ambiguous
name
you
may
prefer
to
apply
i
called
it
in
that
article
a
experience
to
get
classed
either
as
a
physical
pen
or
as
some
one
percept
of
a
pen
it
must
assume
a
and
that
can
only
happen
in
a
more
complicated
world
so
far
as
in
that
world
it
is
a
stable
feature
holds
ink
marks
paper
and
obeys
the
guidance
of
a
hand
it
is
a
physical
pen
that
is
what
we
mean
by
being
in
a
pen
so
far
as
it
is
instable
on
the
contrary
coming
and
going
with
the
movements
of
my
eyes
altering
with
what
i
call
my
fancy
continuous
with
subsequent
experiences
of
its
been
in
the
past
tense
it
is
the
percept
of
a
pen
in
my
mind
those
peculiarities
are
what
we
mean
by
being
in
a
pen
in
section
vi
of
another
essay
i
tried
to
show
that
the
same
the
same
numerically
identical
pen
of
pure
experience
can
enter
simultaneously
into
many
conscious
contexts
or
in
other
words
be
an
object
for
many
different
minds
i
admitted
that
i
had
not
space
to
treat
of
certain
possible
objections
in
that
article
but
in
the
last
essay
i
took
some
of
the
objections
up
at
the
end
of
that
essay
i
said
that
still
more
objections
remained
so
to
leave
my
theory
in
as
strong
a
state
as
possible
i
propose
to
consider
those
objections
now
i
the
objections
i
previously
tried
to
dispose
of
were
purely
logical
or
dialectical
no
one
identical
term
whether
physical
or
psychical
it
had
been
said
could
be
the
subject
of
two
relations
at
once
this
thesis
i
sought
to
prove
unfounded
the
objections
that
now
confront
us
arise
from
the
nature
supposed
to
inhere
in
psychic
facts
specifically
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
physical
objects
a
fact
of
consciousness
it
is
alleged
and
indeed
very
plausibly
can
not
without
be
treated
as
a
portion
of
two
different
minds
and
for
the
following
reasons
in
the
physical
world
we
make
with
impunity
the
assumption
that
one
and
the
same
material
object
can
figure
in
an
indefinitely
large
number
of
different
processes
at
once
when
for
instance
a
sheet
of
rubber
is
pulled
at
its
four
corners
a
unit
of
rubber
in
the
middle
of
the
sheet
is
affected
by
all
four
of
the
pulls
it
them
each
as
if
it
pulled
in
four
different
ways
at
once
itself
so
an
or
an
the
different
directions
of
movement
imprinted
on
it
without
obliterating
their
several
individualities
it
delivers
them
distinct
on
the
contrary
at
as
many
several
ear
eye
or
what
not
as
may
be
to
that
effect
the
apparent
paradox
of
a
distinctness
like
this
surviving
in
the
midst
of
compounding
is
a
thing
which
i
fancy
the
analyses
made
by
physicists
have
by
this
time
sufficiently
cleared
up
but
if
on
the
strength
of
these
analogies
one
should
ask
why
if
two
or
more
lines
can
run
through
one
and
the
same
geometrical
point
or
if
two
or
more
distinct
processes
of
activity
can
run
through
one
and
the
same
physical
thing
so
that
it
simultaneously
plays
a
rôle
in
each
and
every
process
might
not
two
or
more
streams
of
personal
consciousness
include
one
and
the
same
unit
of
experience
so
that
it
would
simultaneously
be
a
part
of
the
experience
of
all
the
different
minds
one
would
be
checked
by
thinking
of
a
certain
peculiarity
by
which
phenomena
of
consciousness
differ
from
physical
things
while
physical
things
namely
are
supposed
to
be
permanent
and
to
have
their
a
fact
of
consciousness
exists
but
once
and
a
state
its
is
it
is
only
so
far
as
it
is
felt
and
it
is
unambiguously
and
unequivocally
exactly
is
felt
the
hypothesis
under
consideration
would
however
oblige
it
to
be
felt
equivocally
felt
now
as
part
of
my
mind
and
again
at
the
same
time
as
a
part
of
my
mind
but
of
yours
for
my
mind
is
yours
and
this
would
seem
impossible
without
doubling
it
into
two
distinct
things
or
in
other
words
without
reverting
to
the
ordinary
dualistic
philosophy
of
insulated
minds
each
knowing
its
object
representatively
as
a
third
thing
and
that
would
be
to
give
up
the
scheme
altogether
can
we
see
then
any
way
in
which
a
unit
of
pure
experience
might
enter
into
and
figure
in
two
diverse
streams
of
consciousness
without
turning
itself
into
the
two
units
which
on
our
hypothesis
it
must
not
be
ii
there
is
a
way
and
the
first
step
towards
it
is
to
see
more
precisely
how
the
unit
enters
into
either
one
of
the
streams
of
consciousness
alone
just
what
from
being
does
its
becoming
mean
it
means
first
that
new
experiences
have
supervened
and
second
that
they
have
borne
a
certain
assignable
relation
to
the
unit
supposed
continue
if
you
please
to
speak
of
the
pure
unit
as
pen
so
far
as
the
pen
successors
do
but
repeat
the
pen
or
being
different
from
it
are
related
to
it
it
and
they
will
form
a
group
of
stably
existing
physical
things
so
far
however
as
its
successors
differ
from
it
in
another
way
the
pen
will
figure
in
their
context
not
as
a
physical
but
as
a
mental
fact
it
will
become
a
passing
percept
of
that
pen
what
now
is
that
decisive
way
in
the
chapter
on
self
in
my
of
i
explained
the
continuous
identity
of
each
personal
consciousness
as
a
name
for
the
practical
fact
that
new
experiences
come
which
look
back
on
the
old
ones
find
them
and
greet
and
appropriate
them
as
these
operations
mean
when
analyzed
empirically
several
tolerably
definite
things
viz
that
the
new
experience
has
past
time
for
its
and
in
that
time
a
pen
that
that
was
also
about
the
pen
in
the
sense
of
a
group
of
feelings
aroused
turned
employed
etc
that
were
closely
connected
with
it
and
that
now
recur
and
evermore
recur
with
unbroken
vividness
though
from
the
pen
of
now
which
may
be
only
an
image
all
such
vividness
may
have
gone
that
these
feelings
are
the
nucleus
of
that
whatever
once
was
associated
with
them
was
at
least
for
that
one
moment
my
implement
if
associated
with
my
only
if
only
and
were
involved
the
pen
realized
in
this
retrospective
way
as
my
percept
thus
figures
as
a
fact
of
life
but
it
does
so
only
so
far
as
has
occurred
and
appropriation
is
of
the
content
of
a
later
wholly
additional
to
the
originally
pen
pen
virtually
both
objective
and
subjective
is
at
its
own
moment
actually
and
intrinsically
neither
it
has
to
be
looked
back
upon
and
in
order
to
be
classed
in
either
distinctive
way
but
its
use
so
called
is
in
the
hands
of
the
other
experience
while
stands
throughout
the
operation
passive
and
unchanged
if
this
pass
muster
as
an
intelligible
account
of
how
an
experience
originally
pure
can
enter
into
one
consciousness
the
next
question
is
as
to
how
it
might
conceivably
enter
into
two
iii
obviously
no
new
kind
of
condition
would
have
to
be
supplied
all
that
we
should
have
to
postulate
would
be
a
second
subsequent
experience
collateral
and
contemporary
with
the
first
subsequent
one
in
which
a
similar
act
of
appropriation
should
occur
the
two
acts
would
interfere
neither
with
one
another
nor
with
the
originally
pure
pen
it
would
sleep
undisturbed
in
its
own
past
no
matter
how
many
such
successors
went
through
their
several
appropriative
acts
each
would
know
it
as
percept
each
would
class
it
as
a
fact
nor
need
their
so
classing
it
interfere
in
the
least
with
their
classing
it
at
the
same
time
as
a
physical
pen
since
the
classing
in
both
cases
depends
upon
the
taking
of
it
in
one
group
or
another
of
associates
if
the
superseding
experience
were
of
wide
enough
it
could
think
the
pen
in
both
groups
simultaneously
and
yet
distinguish
the
two
groups
it
would
then
see
the
whole
situation
conformably
to
what
we
call
representative
theory
of
cognition
and
that
is
what
we
all
spontaneously
do
as
a
man
philosophizing
i
believe
that
what
i
see
myself
writing
with
is
double
i
think
it
in
its
relations
to
physical
nature
and
also
in
its
relations
to
my
personal
life
i
see
that
it
is
in
my
mind
but
that
it
also
is
a
physical
pen
the
paradox
of
the
same
experience
figuring
in
two
consciousnesses
seems
thus
no
paradox
at
all
to
be
means
not
simply
to
be
but
to
be
reported
known
to
have
awareness
of
one
being
added
to
that
being
and
this
is
just
what
happens
when
the
appropriative
experience
supervenes
the
in
its
original
immediacy
is
not
aware
of
itself
it
simply
and
the
second
experience
is
required
for
what
we
call
awareness
of
it
to
occur
the
difficulty
of
understanding
what
happens
here
is
therefore
not
a
logical
difficulty
there
is
no
contradiction
involved
it
is
an
ontological
difficulty
rather
experiences
come
on
an
enormous
scale
and
if
we
take
them
all
together
they
come
in
a
chaos
of
incommensurable
relations
that
we
can
not
straighten
out
we
have
to
abstract
different
groups
of
them
and
handle
these
separately
if
we
are
to
talk
of
them
at
all
but
how
the
experiences
ever
themselves
or
their
characters
and
relations
are
just
such
as
appear
we
can
not
begin
to
understand
granting
however
that
by
hook
or
crook
they
get
themselves
made
and
can
appear
in
the
successions
that
i
have
so
schematically
described
then
we
have
to
confess
that
even
although
as
i
began
by
quoting
from
the
adversary
feeling
only
is
as
it
is
felt
there
is
still
nothing
absurd
in
the
notion
of
its
being
felt
in
two
different
ways
at
once
as
yours
namely
and
as
mine
it
is
indeed
only
as
it
is
felt
as
mine
and
only
as
it
is
felt
as
yours
but
it
is
felt
as
neither
but
only
when
by
our
two
several
remembering
experiences
just
as
one
undivided
estate
is
owned
by
several
heirs
iv
one
word
now
before
i
close
about
the
corollaries
of
the
views
set
forth
since
the
acquisition
of
conscious
quality
on
the
part
of
an
experience
depends
upon
a
context
coming
to
it
it
follows
that
the
sum
total
of
all
experiences
having
no
context
can
not
strictly
be
called
conscious
at
all
it
is
a
an
absolute
a
experience
on
an
enormous
scale
undifferentiated
and
undifferentiable
into
thought
and
thing
this
the
idealists
have
always
practically
acknowledged
by
calling
their
doctrine
an
the
question
of
the
of
the
all
of
things
ought
not
then
even
to
be
asked
no
more
ought
the
question
of
its
to
be
asked
for
truth
is
a
relation
inside
of
the
sum
total
obtaining
between
thoughts
and
something
else
and
thoughts
as
we
have
seen
can
only
be
contextual
things
in
these
respects
the
pure
experiences
of
our
philosophy
are
in
themselves
considered
so
many
little
absolutes
the
philosophy
of
pure
experience
being
only
a
more
comminuted
meanwhile
a
pure
experience
can
be
postulated
with
any
amount
whatever
of
span
or
field
if
it
exert
the
retrospective
and
appropriative
function
on
any
other
piece
of
experience
the
latter
thereby
enters
into
its
own
conscious
stream
and
in
this
operation
time
intervals
make
no
essential
difference
after
sleeping
my
retrospection
is
as
perfect
as
it
is
between
two
successive
waking
moments
of
my
time
accordingly
if
millions
of
years
later
a
similarly
retrospective
experience
should
anyhow
come
to
birth
my
present
thought
would
form
a
genuine
portion
of
its
conscious
life
a
portion
i
say
but
not
in
the
sense
that
the
two
things
could
be
entitatively
or
substantively
one
they
can
not
for
they
are
numerically
discrete
facts
but
only
in
the
sense
that
the
of
my
present
thought
its
knowledge
its
purpose
its
content
and
in
short
being
inherited
would
be
continued
practically
unchanged
speculations
like
fechner
of
an
of
wider
spans
of
consciousness
enveloping
narrower
ones
throughout
the
cosmos
are
therefore
philosophically
quite
in
order
provided
they
distinguish
the
functional
from
the
entitative
point
of
view
and
do
not
treat
the
minor
consciousness
under
discussion
as
a
kind
of
standing
material

which

we

is
and
known
in
contrast
with
the
objective
which
it
envelopes
and
accompanies
in
opposition
to
this
dualistic
philosophy

tried
in

to
show
that
thoughts
and
things
are
absolutely
homogeneous
as
to
their
material
and
that
their
opposition
is
only
one
of
relation
and
of
function
there
is
no
different
from
i
said
but
the
same
identical
piece
of
experience
which
was
the
name
i
gave
to
the
of
everything
can
stand
alternately
for
a
of
consciousness
or
for
a
physical
reality
according
as
it
is
taken
in
one
context
or
in
another
for
the
right
understanding
of
what
follows
i
shall
have
to
presuppose
that
the
reader
will
have
read
that
essay
the
commonest
objection
which
the
doctrine
there
laid
down
runs
up
against
is
drawn
from
the
existence
of
our
in
our
pleasures
and
pains
our
loves
and
fears
and
angers
in
the
beauty
comicality
importance
or
preciousness
of
certain
objects
and
situations
we
have
i
am
told
by
many
critics
a
great
realm
of
experience
intuitively
recognized
as
spiritual
made
and
felt
to
be
made
of
consciousness
exclusively
and
different
in
nature
from
the
kind
of
being
which
is
enjoyed
by
physical
objects
in
section
vii
of
the
first
essay
i
treated
of
this
class
of
experiences
very
inadequately
because
i
had
to
be
so
brief
i
now
return
to
the
subject
because
i
believe
that
so
far
from
invalidating
my
general
thesis
these
phenomena
when
properly
analyzed
afford
it
powerful
support
the
central
point
of
the
theory
is
that
and
are
names
for
two
groups
into
which
we
sort
experiences
according
to
the
way
in
which
they
act
upon
their
neighbors
any
one
such
as
let
us
say
can
be
assigned
to
either
group
in
the
outer
group
it
is
it
acts
and
aggressively
here
whatever
is
hard
interferes
with
the
space
its
neighbors
occupy
it
dents
them
is
impenetrable
by
them
and
we
call
the
hardness
then
a
physical
hardness
in
the
mind
on
the
contrary
the
hard
thing
is
nowhere
in
particular
it
dents
nothing
it
suffuses
through
its
mental
neighbors
as
it
were
and
interpenetrates
them
taken
in
this
group
we
call
both
it
and
them
or
and
the
basis
of
the
two
groups
respectively
is
the
different
type
of
interrelation
the
mutual
impenetrability
on
the
one
hand
and
the
lack
of
physical
interference
and
interaction
on
the
other
that
what
in
itself
is
one
and
the
same
entity
should
be
able
to
function
thus
differently
in
different
contexts
is
a
natural
consequence
of
the
extremely
complex
reticulations
in
which
our
experiences
come
to
her
offspring
a
tigress
is
tender
but
cruel
to
every
other
living
thing
both
cruel
and
tender
therefore
at
once
a
mass
in
movement
resists
every
force
that
operates
contrariwise
to
its
own
direction
but
to
forces
that
pursue
the
same
direction
or
come
in
at
right
angles
it
is
absolutely
inert
it
is
thus
both
energetic
and
inert
and
the
same
is
true
if
you
vary
the
associates
properly
of
every
other
piece
of
experience
it
is
only
towards
certain
specific
groups
of
associates
that
the
physical
energies
as
we
call
them
of
a
content
are
put
forth
in
another
group
it
may
be
quite
inert
it
is
possible
to
imagine
a
universe
of
experiences
in
which
the
only
alternative
between
neighbors
would
be
either
physical
interaction
or
complete
inertness
in
such
a
world
the
mental
or
the
physical
of
any
piece
of
experience
would
be
unequivocal
when
active
it
would
figure
in
the
physical
and
when
inactive
in
the
mental
group
but
the
universe
we
live
in
is
more
chaotic
than
this
and
there
is
room
in
it
for
the
hybrid
or
ambiguous
group
of
our
affectional
experiences
of
our
emotions
and
appreciative
perceptions
in
the
paragraphs
that
follow
i
shall
try
to
show
that
the
popular
notion
that
these
experiences
are
intuitively
given
as
purely
inner
facts
is
hasty
and
erroneous
and
that
their
ambiguity
illustrates
beautifully
my
central
thesis
that
subjectivity
and
objectivity
are
affairs
not
of
what
an
experience
is
aboriginally
made
of
but
of
its
classification
classifications
depend
on
our
temporary
purposes
for
certain
purposes
it
is
convenient
to
take
things
in
one
set
of
relations
for
other
purposes
in
another
set
in
the
two
cases
their
contexts
are
apt
to
be
different
in
the
case
of
our
affectional
experiences
we
have
no
permanent
and
steadfast
purpose
that
obliges
us
to
be
consistent
so
we
find
it
easy
to
let
them
float
ambiguously
sometimes
classing
them
with
our
feelings
sometimes
with
more
physical
realities
according
to
caprice
or
to
the
convenience
of
the
moment
thus
would
these
experiences
so
far
from
being
an
obstacle
to
the
pure
experience
philosophy
serve
as
an
excellent
corroboration
of
its
truth
first
of
all
then
it
is
a
mistake
to
say
with
the
objectors
whom
i
began
by
citing
that
anger
love
and
fear
are
affections
purely
of
the
mind
that
to
a
great
extent
at
any
rate
they
are
simultaneously
affections
of
the
body
is
proved
by
the
whole
literature
of
the
theory
of
emotion
all
our
pains
moreover
are
local
and
we
are
always
free
to
speak
of
them
in
objective
as
well
as
in
subjective
terms
we
can
say
that
we
are
aware
of
a
painful
place
filling
a
certain
bigness
in
our
organism
or
we
can
say
that
we
are
inwardly
in
a
of
pain
all
our
adjectives
of
worth
are
similarly
ambiguous
i
instanced
some
of
the
ambiguities
in
the
first
essay
is
the
preciousness
of
a
diamond
a
quality
of
the
gem
or
is
it
a
feeling
in
our
mind
practically
we
treat
it
as
both
or
as
either
according
to
the
temporary
direction
of
our
thought
says
professor
santayana
pleasure
objectified
and
in
sections
and
of
his
work
sense
of
he
treats
in
a
masterly
way
of
this
equivocal
realm
the
various
pleasures
we
receive
from
an
object
may
count
as
when
we
take
them
singly
but
when
they
combine
in
a
total
richness
we
call
the
result
the
of
the
object
and
treat
it
as
an
outer
attribute
which
our
mind
perceives
we
discover
beauty
just
as
we
discover
the
physical
properties
of
things
training
is
needed
to
make
us
expert
in
either
line
single
sensations
also
may
be
ambiguous
shall
we
say
an
degree
of
heat
or
an
feeling
occasioned
by
the
degree
of
heat
either
will
do
and
language
would
lose
most
of
its
esthetic
and
rhetorical
value
were
we
forbidden
to
project
words
primarily
connoting
our
affections
upon
the
objects
by
which
the
affections
are
aroused
the
man
is
really
hateful
the
action
really
mean
the
situation
really
tragic
all
in
themselves
and
quite
apart
from
our
opinion
we
even
go
so
far
as
to
talk
of
a
weary
road
a
giddy
height
a
jocund
morning
or
a
sullen
sky
and
the
term
while
usually
applied
only
to
our
apprehensions
functions
as
a
fundamental
physical
qualification
of
things
in
spencer
of
evolution
and
doubtless
passes
with
most
readers
for
all
right
psychologists
studying
our
perceptions
of
movement
have
unearthed
experiences
in
which
movement
is
felt
in
general
but
not
ascribed
correctly
to
the
body
that
really
moves
thus
in
optical
vertigo
caused
by
unconscious
movements
of
our
eyes
both
we
and
the
external
universe
appear
to
be
in
a
whirl
when
clouds
float
by
the
moon
it
is
as
if
both
clouds
and
moon
and
we
ourselves
shared
in
the
motion
in
the
extraordinary
case
of
amnesia
of
the
rev
hanna
published
by
sidis
and
goodhart
in
their
important
work
on
we
read
that
when
the
patient
first
recovered
consciousness
and
noticed
an
attendant
walk
across
the
room
he
identified
the
movement
with
that
of
his
own
he
did
not
yet
discriminate
between
his
own
movements
and
those
outside
himself
such
experiences
point
to
a
primitive
stage
of
perception
in
which
discriminations
afterwards
needful
have
not
yet
been
made
a
piece
of
experience
of
a
determinate
sort
is
there
but
there
at
first
as
a
fact
motion
originally
simply
only
later
is
it
confined
to
this
thing
or
to
that
something
like
this
is
true
of
every
experience
however
complex
at
the
moment
of
its
actual
presence
let
the
reader
arrest
himself
in
the
act
of
reading
this
article
now
this
is
a
pure
experience
a
phenomenon
or
datum
a
mere
or
content
of
fact
simply
is
is
and
whether
there
for
some
one
consciousness
or
there
for
physical
nature
is
a
question
not
yet
put
at
the
moment
it
is
there
for
neither
later
we
shall
probably
judge
it
to
have
been
there
for
both
with
the
affectional
experiences
which
we
are
considering
the
relatively
condition
lasts
in
practical
life
no
urgent
need
has
yet
arisen
for
deciding
whether
to
treat
them
as
rigorously
mental
or
as
rigorously
physical
facts
so
they
remain
equivocal
and
as
the
world
goes
their
equivocality
is
one
of
their
great
conveniences
the
shifting
place
of
qualities
in
the
history
of
philosophy
is
another
excellent
proof
of
the
fact
that
and
are
not
coefficients
with
which
experiences
come
to
us
aboriginally
stamped
but
are
rather
results
of
a
later
classification
performed
by
us
for
particular
needs
the
stage
of
thought
is
a
perfectly
definite
practical
the
place
where
we
ourselves
can
proceed
to
act
unhesitatingly
on
this
stage
of
thought
things
act
on
each
other
as
well
as
on
us
by
means
of
their
secondary
qualities
sound
as
such
goes
through
the
air
and
can
be
intercepted
the
heat
of
the
fire
passes
over
as
such
into
the
water
which
it
sets
it
is
the
very
light
of
the
which
displaces
the
darkness
of
the
midnight
street
etc
by
engendering
and
translocating
just
these
qualities
actively
efficacious
as
they
seem
to
be
we
ourselves
succeed
in
altering
nature
so
as
to
suit
us
and
until
more
purely
intellectual
as
distinguished
from
practical
needs
had
arisen
no
one
ever
thought
of
calling
these
qualities
subjective
when
however
galileo
descartes
and
others
found
it
best
for
philosophic
purposes
to
class
sound
heat
and
light
along
with
pain
and
pleasure
as
purely
mental
phenomena
they
could
do
so
with
impunity
even
the
primary
qualities
are
undergoing
the
same
fate
hardness
and
softness
are
effects
on
us
of
atomic
interactions
and
the
atoms
themselves
are
neither
hard
nor
soft
nor
solid
nor
liquid
size
and
shape
are
deemed
subjective
by
kantians
time
itself
is
subjective
according
to
many
philosophers
and
even
the
activity
and
causal
efficacy
which
lingered
in
physics
long
after
secondary
qualities
were
banished
are
now
treated
as
illusory
projections
outwards
of
phenomena
of
our
own
consciousness
there
are
no
activities
or
effects
in
nature
for
the
most
intellectual
contemporary
school
of
physical
speculation
nature
exhibits
only
which
habitually
coincide
with
one
another
so
that
their
habits
are
describable
in
simple
there
is
no
original
spirituality
or
materiality
of
being
intuitively
discerned
then
but
only
a
translocation
of
experiences
from
one
world
to
another
a
grouping
of
them
with
one
set
or
another
of
associates
for
definitely
practical
or
intellectual
ends
i
will
say
nothing
here
of
the
persistent
ambiguity
of
they
are
undeniable
parts
of
pure
experience
yet
while
common
sense
and
what
i
call
radical
empiricism
stand
for
their
being
objective
both
rationalism
and
the
usual
empiricism
claim
that
they
are
exclusively
the
of
the
mind
the
finite
mind
or
the
absolute
mind
as
the
case
may
be
turn
now
to
those
affective
phenomena
which
more
directly
concern
us
we
soon
learn
to
separate
the
ways
in
which
things
appeal
to
our
interests
and
emotions
from
the
ways
in
which
they
act
upon
one
another
it
does
not
to
assume
that
physical
objects
are
going
to
act
outwardly
by
their
sympathetic
or
antipathetic
qualities
the
beauty
of
a
thing
or
its
value
is
no
force
that
can
be
plotted
in
a
polygon
of
compositions
nor
does
its
or
affect
in
the
minutest
degree
its
vicissitudes
or
destiny
at
the
hands
of
physical
nature
chemical
are
a
purely
verbal
metaphor
and
as
i
just
said
even
such
things
as
forces
tensions
and
activities
can
at
a
pinch
be
regarded
as
anthropomorphic
projections
so
far
then
as
the
physical
world
means
the
collection
of
contents
that
determine
in
each
other
certain
regular
changes
the
whole
collection
of
our
appreciative
attributes
has
to
be
treated
as
falling
outside
of
it
if
we
mean
by
physical
nature
whatever
lies
beyond
the
surface
of
our
bodies
these
attributes
are
inert
throughout
the
whole
extent
of
physical
nature
why
then
do
men
leave
them
as
ambiguous
as
they
do
and
not
class
them
decisively
as
purely
spiritual
the
reason
would
seem
to
be
that
although
they
are
inert
as
regards
the
rest
of
physical
nature
they
are
not
inert
as
regards
that
part
of
physical
nature
which
our
own
skin
covers
it
is
those
very
appreciative
attributes
of
things
their
dangerousness
beauty
rarity
utility
that
primarily
appeal
to
our
attention
in
our
commerce
with
nature
these
attributes
are
what
give
to
objects
and
for
an
object
to
be
emphatic
whatever
spiritual
fact
it
may
mean
means
also
that
it
produces
immediate
bodily
effects
upon
us
alterations
of
tone
and
tension
of
and
breathing
of
vascular
and
visceral
action
the
aspects
of
things
are
thus
not
wholly
inert
physically
though
they
be
active
only
in
these
small
corners
of
physical
nature
which
our
bodies
occupy
that
however
is
enough
to
save
them
from
being
classed
as
absolutely
the
attempt
if
any
one
should
make
it
to
sort
experiences
into
two
absolutely
discrete
groups
with
nothing
but
inertness
in
one
of
them
and
nothing
but
activities
in
the
other
would
thus
receive
one
check
it
would
receive
another
as
soon
as
we
examined
the
more
distinctively
mental
group
for
though
in
that
group
it
be
true
that
things
do
not
act
on
one
another
by
their
physical
properties
do
not
dent
each
other
or
set
fire
to
each
other
they
yet
act
on
each
other
in
the
most
energetic
way
by
those
very
characters
which
are
so
inert
extracorporeally
it
is
by
the
interest
and
importance
that
experiences
have
for
us
by
the
emotions
they
excite
and
the
purposes
they
subserve
by
their
affective
values
in
short
that
their
consecution
in
our
several
conscious
streams
as
of
ours
is
mainly
ruled
desire
introduces
them
interest
holds
them
fitness
fixes
their
order
and
connection
i
need
only
refer
for
this
aspect
of
our
mental
life
to
wundt
article
psychische
causalität
which
begins
volume
of
his
it
thus
appears
that
the
ambiguous
or
amphibious
which
we
find
our
epithets
of
value
occupying
is
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
it
would
however
be
an
unnatural
status
if
the
popular
opinion
which
i
cited
at
the
outset
were
correct
if
and
meant
two
different
kinds
of
intrinsic
nature
immediately
intuitively
and
infallibly
discernible
and
each
fixed
forever
in
whatever
bit
of
experience
it
qualified
one
does
not
see
how
there
could
ever
have
arisen
any
room
for
doubt
or
ambiguity
but
if
on
the
contrary
these
words
are
words
of
sorting
ambiguity
is
natural
for
then
as
soon
as
the
relations
of
a
thing
are
sufficiently
various
it
can
be
sorted
variously
take
a
mass
of
carrion
for
example
and
the
which
for
us
is
part
of
the
experience
the
sun
caresses
it
and
the
zephyr
wooes
it
as
if
it
were
a
bed
of
roses
so
the
disgustingness
fails
to
within
the
realm
of
suns
and
breezes
it
does
not
function
as
a
physical
quality
but
the
carrion
our
stomach
by
what
seems
a
direct
operation
it
function
physically
therefore
in
that
limited
part
of
physics
we
can
treat
it
as
physical
or
as
according
as
we
take
it
in
the
narrower
or
in
the
wider
context
and
conversely
of
course
we
must
treat
it
as
or
as
mental
our
body
itself
is
the
palmary
instance
of
the
ambiguous
sometimes
i
treat
my
body
purely
as
a
part
of
outer
nature
sometimes
again
i
think
of
it
as
i
sort
it
with
the
and
then
certain
local
changes
and
determinations
in
it
pass
for
spiritual
happenings
its
breathing
is
my
its
sensorial
adjustments
are
my
its
kinesthetic
alterations
are
my
its
visceral
perturbations
are
my
the
obstinate
controversies
that
have
arisen
over
such
statements
as
these
which
sound
so
paradoxical
and
which
can
yet
be
made
so
seriously
prove
how
hard
it
is
to
decide
by
bare
introspection
what
it
is
in
experiences
that
shall
make
them
either
spiritual
or
material
it
surely
can
be
nothing
intrinsic
in
the
individual
experience
it
is
their
way
of
behaving
towards
each
other
their
system
of
relations
their
function
and
all
these
things
vary
with
the
context
in
which
we
find
it
opportune
to
consider
them
i
think
i
may
conclude
then
and
i
hope
that
my
readers
are
now
ready
to
conclude
with
me
that
the
pretended
spirituality
of
our
emotions
and
of
our
attributes
of
value
so
far
from
proving
an
objection
to
the
philosophy
of
pure
experience
does
when
rightly
discussed
and
accounted
for
serve
as
one
of
its
best
corroborations

brethren
of
the
psychological
association
in
casting
about
me
for
a
subject
for
your
president
this
year
to
talk
about
it
has
seemed
to
me
that
our
experiences
of
activity
would
form
a
good
one
not
only
because
the
topic
is
so
naturally
interesting
and
because
it
has
lately
led
to
a
good
deal
of
rather
inconclusive
discussion
but
because
i
myself
am
growing
more
and
more
interested
in
a
certain
systematic
way
of
handling
questions
and
want
to
get
others
interested
also
and
this
question
strikes
me
as
one
in
which
although
i
am
painfully
aware
of
my
inability
to
communicate
new
discoveries
or
to
reach
definitive
conclusions
i
yet
can
show
in
a
rather
definite
manner
how
the
method
works
the
way
of
handling
things
i
speak
of
is
as
you
already
will
have
suspected
that
known
sometimes
as
the
pragmatic
method
sometimes
as
humanism
sometimes
as
deweyism
and
in
france
by
some
of
the
disciples
of
bergson
as
the
philosophie
nouvelle
professor
woodbridge
of
seems
unintentionally
to
have
become
a
sort
of
meeting
place
for
those
who
follow
these
tendencies
in
america
there
is
only
a
dim
identity
among
them
and
the
most
that
can
be
said
at
present
is
that
some
sort
of
gestation
seems
to
be
in
the
atmosphere
and
that
almost
any
day
a
man
with
a
genius
for
finding
the
right
word
for
things
may
hit
upon
some
unifying
and
conciliating
formula
that
will
make
so
much
vaguely
similar
aspiration
crystallize
into
more
definite
form
i
myself
have
given
the
name
of
empiricism
to
that
version
of
the
tendency
in
question
which
i
prefer
and
i
propose
if
you
will
now
let
me
to
illustrate
what
i
mean
by
radical
empiricism
by
applying
it
to
activity
as
an
example
hoping
at
the
same
time
incidentally
to
leave
the
general
problem
of
activity
in
a
slightly
i
fear
very
slightly
more
manageable
shape
than
before
bradley
calls
the
question
of
activity
a
scandal
to
philosophy
and
if
one
turns
to
the
current
literature
of
the
subject
his
own
writings
included
one
easily
gathers
what
he
means
the
opponents
can
not
even
understand
one
another
bradley
says
to
ward
i
do
not
care
what
your
oracle
is
and
your
preposterous
psychology
may
here
be
gospel
if
you
please
but
if
the
revelation
does
contain
a
meaning
i
will
commit
myself
to
this
either
the
oracle
is
so
confused
that
its
signification
is
not
discoverable
or
upon
the
other
hand
if
it
can
be
pinned
down
to
any
definite
statement
then
that
statement
will
be
false
ward
in
turn
says
of
bradley
i
can
not
even
imagine
the
state
of
mind
to
which
his
description
applies
it
reads
like
an
unintentional
travesty
of
herbartian
psychology
by
one
who
has
tried
to
improve
upon
it
without
being
at
the
pains
to
master
it
münsterberg
excludes
a
view
opposed
to
his
own
by
saying
that
with
any
one
who
holds
it
a
with
him
is
and
royce
in
a
review
of
stout
hauls
him
over
the
coals
at
great
length
for
defending
in
a
way
which
i
for
one
never
gathered
from
reading
him
and
which
i
have
heard
stout
himself
say
was
quite
foreign
to
the
intention
of
his
text
in
these
discussions
distinct
questions
are
habitually
jumbled
and
different
points
of
view
are
talked
of
there
is
a
psychological
question
have
we
perceptions
of
activity
and
if
so
what
are
they
like
and
when
and
where
do
we
have
them
there
is
a
metaphysical
question
is
there
a
of
activity
and
if
so
what
idea
must
we
frame
of
it
what
is
it
like
and
what
does
it
do
if
it
does
anything
and
finally
there
is
a
logical
question
whence
do
we
activity
by
our
own
feelings
of
it
solely
or
by
some
other
source
of
information
throughout
page
after
page
of
the
literature
one
knows
not
which
of
these
questions
is
before
one
and
mere
description
of
the
of
experience
is
proferred
as
if
it
implicitly
answered
every
one
of
them
no
one
of
the
disputants
moreover
tries
to
show
what
pragmatic
consequences
his
own
view
would
carry
or
what
assignable
particular
differences
in
any
one
experience
it
would
make
if
his
adversary
were
triumphant
it
seems
to
me
that
if
radical
empiricism
be
good
for
anything
it
ought
with
its
pragmatic
method
and
its
principle
of
pure
experience
to
be
able
to
avoid
such
tangles
or
at
least
to
simplify
them
somewhat
the
pragmatic
method
starts
from
the
postulate
that
there
is
no
difference
of
truth
that
does
make
a
difference
of
fact
somewhere
and
it
seeks
to
determine
the
meaning
of
all
differences
of
opinion
by
making
the
discussion
hinge
as
soon
as
possible
upon
some
practical
or
particular
issue
the
principle
of
pure
experience
is
also
a
methodical
postulate
nothing
shall
be
admitted
as
fact
it
says
except
what
can
be
experienced
at
some
definite
time
by
some
experient
and
for
every
feature
of
fact
ever
so
experienced
a
definite
place
must
be
found
somewhere
in
the
final
system
of
reality
in
other
words
everything
real
must
be
experienceable
somewhere
and
every
kind
of
thing
experienced
must
somewhere
be
real
armed
with
these
rules
of
method
let
us
see
what
face
the
problems
of
activity
present
to
us
by
the
principle
of
pure
experience
either
the
word
must
have
no
meaning
at
all
or
else
the
original
type
and
model
of
what
it
means
must
lie
in
some
concrete
kind
of
experience
that
can
be
definitely
pointed
out
whatever
ulterior
judgments
we
may
eventually
come
to
make
regarding
activity
of
thing
will
be
what
the
judgments
are
about
the
first
step
to
take
then
is
to
ask
where
in
the
stream
of
experience
we
seem
to
find
what
we
speak
of
as
activity
what
we
are
to
think
of
the
activity
thus
found
will
be
a
later
question
now
it
is
obvious
that
we
are
tempted
to
affirm
activity
wherever
we
find
anything
taken
in
the
broadest
sense
any
apprehension
of
something
is
an
experience
of
activity
were
our
world
describable
only
by
the
words
happening
changing
doing
we
should
unquestionably
call
it
an
world
bare
activity
then
as
we
may
call
it
means
the
bare
fact
of
event
or
change
taking
place
is
a
unique
content
of
experience
one
of
those
objects
which
radical
empiricism
seeks
so
earnestly
to
rehabilitate
and
preserve
the
sense
of
activity
is
thus
in
the
broadest
and
vaguest
way
synonymous
with
the
sense
of
we
should
feel
our
own
subjective
life
at
least
even
in
noticing
and
proclaiming
an
otherwise
inactive
world
our
own
reaction
on
its
monotony
would
be
the
one
thing
experienced
there
in
the
form
of
something
coming
to
pass
this
seems
to
be
what
certain
writers
have
in
mind
when
they
insist
that
for
an
experient
to
be
at
all
is
to
be
active
it
seems
to
justify
or
at
any
rate
to
explain
ward
expression
that
we
only
as
we
are
active
for
we
only
as
experients
and
it
rules
out
bradley
contention
that
there
is
no
original
experience
of
anything
like
activity
what
we
ought
to
say
about
activities
thus
elementary
whose
they
are
what
they
effect
or
whether
indeed
they
effect
anything
at
all
these
are
later
questions
to
be
answered
only
when
the
field
of
experience
is
enlarged
bare
activity
would
thus
be
predicable
though
there
were
no
definite
direction
no
actor
and
no
aim
mere
restless
zigzag
movement
or
a
wild
or
der
as
kant
would
say
would
constitute
an
active
as
distinguished
from
an
inactive
world
but
in
this
actual
world
of
ours
as
it
is
given
a
part
at
least
of
the
activity
comes
with
definite
direction
it
comes
with
desire
and
sense
of
goal
it
comes
complicated
with
resistances
which
it
overcomes
or
succumbs
to
and
with
the
efforts
which
the
feeling
of
resistance
so
often
provokes
and
it
is
in
complex
experiences
like
these
that
the
notions
of
distinct
agents
and
of
passivity
as
opposed
to
activity
arise
here
also
the
notion
of
causal
efficacy
comes
to
birth
perhaps
the
most
elaborate
work
ever
done
in
descriptive
psychology
has
been
the
analysis
by
various
recent
writers
of
the
more
complex
in
their
descriptions
exquisitely
subtle
some
of
them
the
activity
appears
as
the
or
the
or
as
whatever
else
you
may
please
to
call
the
conjunctive
form
which
the
content
falls
into
when
we
experience
it
in
the
ways
which
the
describers
set
forth
those
factors
in
those
relations
are
what
we
mean
by
and
to
the
possible
enumeration
and
accumulation
of
their
circumstances
and
ingredients
there
would
seem
to
be
no
natural
bound
every
hour
of
human
life
could
contribute
to
the
picture
gallery
and
this
is
the
only
fault
that
one
can
find
with
such
descriptive
industry
where
is
it
going
to
stop
ought
we
to
listen
forever
to
verbal
pictures
of
what
we
have
already
in
concrete
form
in
our
own
breasts
they
never
take
us
off
the
superficial
plane
we
knew
the
facts
already
less
spread
out
and
separated
to
be
sure
but
we
knew
them
still
we
always
felt
our
own
activity
for
example
as
expansion
of
an
idea
with
which
our
self
is
identified
against
an
obstacle
and
the
following
out
of
such
a
definition
through
a
multitude
of
cases
elaborates
the
obvious
so
as
to
be
little
more
than
an
exercise
in
synonymic
speech
all
the
descriptions
have
to
trace
familiar
outlines
and
to
use
familiar
terms
the
activity
is
for
example
attributed
either
to
a
physical
or
to
a
mental
agent
and
is
either
aimless
or
directed
if
directed
it
shows
tendency
the
tendency
may
or
may
not
be
resisted
if
not
we
call
the
activity
immanent
as
when
a
body
moves
in
empty
space
by
its
momentum
or
our
thoughts
wander
at
their
own
sweet
will
if
resistance
is
met
agent
complicates
the
situation
if
now
in
spite
of
resistance
the
original
tendency
continues
effort
makes
its
appearance
and
along
with
effort
strain
or
squeeze
will
in
the
narrower
sense
of
the
word
then
comes
upon
the
scene
whenever
along
with
the
tendency
the
strain
and
squeeze
are
sustained
but
the
resistance
may
be
great
enough
to
check
the
tendency
or
even
to
reverse
its
path
in
that
case
we
if
were
the
original
agents
or
subjects
of
the
tendency
are
overpowered
the
phenomenon
turns
into
one
of
tension
simply
or
of
necessity
according
as
the
opposing
power
is
only
equal
or
is
superior
to
ourselves
whosoever
describes
an
experience
in
such
terms
as
these
describes
an
experience
activity
if
the
word
have
any
meaning
it
must
denote
what
there
is
found
is
complete
activity
in
its
original
and
first
intention
what
it
is
is
what
there
appears
the
experiencer
of
such
a
situation
possesses
all
that
the
idea
contains
he
feels
the
tendency
the
obstacle
the
will
the
strain
the
triumph
or
the
passive
giving
up
just
as
he
feels
the
time
the
space
the
swiftness
or
intensity
the
movement
the
weight
and
color
the
pain
and
pleasure
the
complexity
or
whatever
remaining
characters
the
situation
may
involve
he
goes
through
all
that
ever
can
be
imagined
where
activity
is
supposed
if
we
suppose
activities
to
go
on
outside
of
our
experience
it
is
in
forms
like
these
that
we
must
suppose
them
or
else
give
them
some
other
name
for
the
word
has
no
imaginable
content
whatever
save
these
experiences
of
process
obstruction
striving
strain
or
release
ultimate
as
they
are
of
the
life
given
us
to
be
known
were
this
the
end
of
the
matter
one
might
think
that
whenever
we
had
successfully
lived
through
an
we
should
have
to
be
permitted
without
provoking
contradiction
to
say
that
we
had
been
really
active
that
we
had
met
real
resistance
and
had
really
prevailed
lotze
somewhere
says
that
to
be
an
entity
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
as
an
entity
to
operate
or
be
felt
experienced
recognized
or
in
any
way
realized
as
such
in
our
the
activity
assuredly
fulfils
lotze
demand
it
makes
itself
it
is
witnessed
at
its
work
no
matter
what
activities
there
may
really
be
in
this
extraordinary
universe
of
ours
it
is
impossible
for
us
to
conceive
of
any
one
of
them
being
either
lived
through
or
authentically
known
otherwise
than
in
this
dramatic
shape
of
something
sustaining
a
felt
purpose
against
felt
obstacles
and
overcoming
or
being
overcome
what
means
here
is
clear
to
anyone
who
has
lived
through
the
experience
but
to
no
one
else
just
as
mean
something
only
to
beings
with
ears
eyes
and
tongues
the
in
these
originals
of
experience
is
the
the
curtain
is
the
picture
if
there
is
anything
hiding
in
the
background
it
ought
not
to
be
called
activity
but
should
get
itself
another
name
this
seems
so
obviously
true
that
one
might
well
experience
astonishment
at
finding
so
many
of
the
ablest
writers
on
the
subject
flatly
denying
that
the
activity
we
live
through
in
these
situations
is
real
merely
to
feel
active
is
not
to
be
active
in
their
sight
the
agents
that
appear
in
the
experience
are
not
real
agents
the
resistances
do
not
really
resist
the
effects
that
appear
are
not
really
effects
at
all
it
is
evident
from
this
that
mere
descriptive
analysis
of
any
one
of
our
is
not
the
whole
story
that
there
is
something
still
to
tell
them
that
has
led
such
able
writers
to
conceive
of
a
activity
of
an
activity
that
does
and
does
merely
appear
to
us
to
do
and
compared
with
whose
real
doing
all
this
phenomenal
activity
is
but
a
specious
sham
the
metaphysical
question
opens
here
and
i
think
that
the
state
of
mind
of
one
possessed
by
it
is
often
something
like
this
it
is
all
very
well
we
may
imagine
him
saying
to
talk
about
certain
taking
on
the
form
of
feelings
of
activity
just
as
they
might
take
on
musical
or
geometric
forms
suppose
that
they
do
so
suppose
we
feel
a
will
to
stand
a
strain
does
our
feeling
do
more
than
the
fact
that
the
strain
is
sustained
the
activity
meanwhile
is
the
of
the
fact
and
what
is
the
doing
made
of
before
the
record
is
made
what
in
the
will
it
to
act
thus
and
these
trains
of
experience
themselves
in
which
activities
appear
what
makes
them
at
all
does
the
activity
in
one
bit
of
experience
bring
the
next
bit
into
being
as
an
empiricist
you
can
not
say
so
for
you
have
just
declared
activity
to
be
only
a
kind
of
synthetic
object
or
conjunctive
relation
experienced
between
bits
of
experience
already
made
but
what
made
them
at
all
what
propels
experience
into
being
is
the
activity
that
the
activity
is
only
its
superficial
sign
to
the
metaphysical
question
popped
upon
us
in
this
way
i
must
pay
serious
attention
ere
i
end
my
remarks
but
before
doing
so
let
me
show
that
without
leaving
the
immediate
reticulations
of
experience
or
asking
what
makes
activity
itself
act
we
still
find
the
distinction
between
less
real
and
more
real
activities
forced
upon
us
and
are
driven
to
much
on
the
purely
phenomenal
plane
we
must
not
forget
namely
in
talking
of
the
ultimate
character
of
our
that
each
of
them
is
but
a
portion
of
a
wider
world
one
link
in
the
vast
chain
of
processes
of
experience
out
of
which
history
is
made
each
partial
process
to
him
who
lives
through
it
defines
itself
by
its
origin
and
its
goal
but
to
an
observer
with
a
wider
who
should
live
outside
of
it
that
goal
would
appear
but
as
a
provisional
and
the
subjectively
felt
activity
would
be
seen
to
continue
into
objective
activities
that
led
far
beyond
we
thus
acquire
a
habit
in
discussing
of
defining
them
by
their
relation
to
something
more
if
an
experience
be
one
of
narrow
span
it
will
be
mistaken
as
to
what
activity
it
is
and
whose
you
think
that
are
acting
while
you
are
only
obeying
push
you
think
you
are
doing
but
you
are
doing
something
of
which
you
do
not
dream
for
instance
you
think
you
are
but
drinking
this
glass
but
you
are
really
creating
the
that
will
end
your
days
you
think
you
are
just
driving
this
bargain
but
as
stevenson
says
somewhere
you
are
laying
down
a
link
in
the
policy
of
mankind
generally
speaking
the
onlooker
with
his
wider
field
of
vision
regards
the
of
an
activity
as
what
it
is
more
really
doing
and
most
previous
ascertainable
being
the
first
source
of
action
he
regards
as
the
most
real
agent
in
the
field
the
others
but
transmit
that
agent
impulse
on
him
we
put
responsibility
we
name
him
when
one
asks
us
to
blame
but
the
most
previous
agents
ascertainable
instead
of
being
of
longer
span
are
often
of
much
shorter
span
than
the
activity
in
view
are
our
best
example
my
are
believed
to
excite
each
other
from
next
to
next
by
contiguous
transmission
of
katabolic
alteration
let
us
say
and
to
have
been
doing
so
long
before
this
present
stretch
of
on
my
part
began
if
any
one
stops
its
activity
the
lecturing
will
cease
or
show
disorder
of
form
causa
cessat
et
does
not
this
look
as
if
the
brain
activities
were
the
more
real
activities
and
the
lecturing
activities
on
my
part
only
their
effects
moreover
as
hume
so
clearly
pointed
out
in
my
mental
the
words
physically
to
be
uttered
are
represented
as
the
activity
immediate
goal
these
words
however
can
not
be
uttered
without
intermediate
physical
processes
in
the
bulb
and
vagi
nerves
which
processes
nevertheless
fail
to
figure
in
the
mental
at
all
that
series
therefore
since
it
leaves
out
vitally
real
steps
of
action
can
not
represent
the
real
activities
it
is
something
purely
subjective
the
of
activity
are
elsewhere
they
are
something
far
more
interstitial
so
to
speak
than
what
my
feelings
record
the
facts
of
activity
that
have
in
point
of
fact
been
systematically
pleaded
for
by
philosophers
have
so
far
as
my
information
goes
been
of
three
principal
types
the
first
type
takes
a
consciousness
of
wider
than
ours
to
be
the
vehicle
of
the
more
real
activity
its
will
is
the
agent
and
its
purpose
is
the
action
done
the
second
type
assumes
that
struggling
with
one
another
are
the
agents
and
that
the
prevalence
of
one
set
of
them
is
the
action
the
third
type
believes
that
are
the
agents
and
that
resultant
motor
discharges
are
the
acts
achieved
now
if
we
must
our
immediately
felt
for
the
benefit
of
either
of
these
types
of
substitute
we
ought
to
know
what
the
substitution
practically
involves
practical
difference
ought
it
to
make
instead
of
saying
naïvely
that
am
active
now
in
delivering
this
address
i
say
that
wider
thinker
is
or
that
ideas
are
or
that
are
in
producing
the
result
this
would
be
the
pragmatic
meaning
of
the
three
hypotheses
let
us
take
them
in
succession
in
seeking
a
reply
if
we
assume
a
wider
thinker
it
is
evident
that
his
purposes
envelope
mine
i
am
really
lecturing
him
and
although
i
can
not
surely
know
to
what
end
yet
if
i
take
him
religiously
i
can
trust
it
to
be
a
good
end
and
willingly
connive
i
can
be
happy
in
thinking
that
my
activity
transmits
his
impulse
and
that
his
ends
prolong
my
own
so
long
as
i
take
him
religiously
in
short
he
does
not
my
activities
he
tends
rather
to
corroborate
the
reality
of
them
so
long
as
i
believe
both
them
and
him
to
be
good
when
now
we
turn
to
ideas
the
case
is
different
inasmuch
as
ideas
are
supposed
by
the
association
psychology
to
influence
each
other
only
from
next
to
next
the
of
an
idea
or
pair
of
ideas
is
assumed
to
be
much
smaller
instead
of
being
larger
than
that
of
my
total
conscious
field
the
same
results
may
get
worked
out
in
both
cases
for
this
address
is
being
given
anyhow
but
the
ideas
supposed
to
work
it
out
had
no
prevision
of
the
whole
of
it
and
if
i
was
lecturing
for
an
absolute
thinker
in
the
former
case
so
by
similar
reasoning
are
my
ideas
now
lecturing
for
me
that
is
accomplishing
unwittingly
a
result
which
i
approve
and
adopt
but
when
this
passing
lecture
is
over
there
is
nothing
in
the
bare
notion
that
ideas
have
been
its
agents
that
would
seem
to
guarantee
that
my
present
purposes
in
lecturing
will
be
prolonged
may
have
ulterior
developments
in
view
but
there
is
no
certainty
that
my
ideas
as
such
will
wish
to
or
be
able
to
work
them
out
the
like
is
true
if
be
the
agents
the
activity
of
a
must
be
conceived
of
as
a
tendency
of
exceedingly
short
reach
an
barely
spanning
the
way
to
the
next
cell
for
surely
that
amount
of
actual
must
be
by
the
cells
if
what
happens
between
them
is
to
deserve
the
name
of
activity
at
all
but
here
again
the
gross
resultant
as
perceive
it
is
indifferent
to
the
agents
and
neither
wished
or
willed
or
foreseen
their
being
agents
now
congruous
with
my
will
gives
me
no
guarantee
that
like
results
will
recur
again
from
their
activity
in
point
of
fact
all
sorts
of
other
results
do
occur
my
mistakes
impotencies
perversions
mental
obstructions
and
frustrations
generally
are
also
results
of
the
activity
of
cells
although
these
are
letting
me
lecture
now
on
other
occasions
they
make
me
do
things
that
i
would
willingly
not
do
the
question
is
the
real
activity
is
thus
tantamount
to
the
question
will
be
the
actual
results
its
interest
is
dramatic
how
will
things
work
out
if
the
agents
are
of
one
sort
one
way
if
of
another
sort
they
may
work
out
very
differently
the
pragmatic
meaning
of
the
various
alternatives
in
short
is
great
it
makes
no
merely
verbal
difference
which
opinion
we
take
up
you
see
it
is
the
old
dispute
come
back
materialism
and
teleology
elementary
actions
summing
themselves
or
far
foreseen
ideals
coming
with
effort
into
act
naïvely
we
believe
and
humanly
and
dramatically
we
like
to
believe
that
activities
both
of
wider
and
of
narrower
span
are
at
work
in
life
together
that
both
are
real
and
that
the
tendencies
yoke
the
others
in
their
service
encouraging
them
in
the
right
direction
and
damping
them
when
they
tend
in
other
ways
but
how
to
represent
clearly
the
of
such
steering
of
small
tendencies
by
large
ones
is
a
problem
which
metaphysical
thinkers
will
have
to
ruminate
upon
for
many
years
to
come
even
if
such
control
should
eventually
grow
clearly
picturable
the
question
how
far
it
is
successfully
exerted
in
this
actual
world
can
be
answered
only
by
investigating
the
details
of
fact
no
philosophic
knowledge
of
the
general
nature
and
constitution
of
tendencies
or
of
the
relation
of
larger
to
smaller
ones
can
help
us
to
predict
which
of
all
the
various
competing
tendencies
that
interest
us
in
this
universe
are
likeliest
to
prevail
we
know
as
an
empirical
fact
that
tendencies
often
carry
out
their
purpose
but
we
know
also
that
they
are
often
defeated
by
the
failure
of
some
contemptibly
small
process
on
which
success
depends
a
little
thrombus
in
a
statesman
meningeal
artery
will
throw
an
empire
out
of
gear
i
can
therefore
not
even
hint
at
any
solution
of
the
pragmatic
issue
i
have
only
wished
to
show
you
that
that
issue
is
what
gives
the
real
interest
to
all
inquiries
into
what
kinds
of
activity
may
be
real
are
the
forces
that
really
act
in
the
world
more
foreseeing
or
more
blind
as
between
activities
as
experience
them
and
those
of
our
ideas
or
of
our
the
issue
is
i
said
a
while
back
that
i
should
return
to
the
question
before
ending
so
with
a
few
words
about
that
i
will
now
close
my
remarks
in
whatever
form
we
hear
this
question
propounded
i
think
that
it
always
arises
from
two
things
a
belief
that
must
be
exerted
in
activity
and
a
wonder
as
to
how
causality
is
made
if
we
take
an
at
its
it
seems
as
if
we
caught
flagrante
the
very
power
that
makes
facts
come
and
be
i
now
am
eagerly
striving
for
example
to
get
this
truth
which
i
seem
half
to
perceive
into
words
which
shall
make
it
show
more
clearly
if
the
words
come
it
will
seem
as
if
the
striving
itself
had
drawn
or
pulled
them
into
actuality
out
from
the
state
of
merely
possible
being
in
which
they
were
how
is
this
feat
performed
how
does
the
pulling
how
do
i
get
my
hold
on
words
not
yet
existent
and
when
they
come
by
what
means
have
i
them
come
really
it
is
the
problem
of
creation
for
in
the
end
the
question
is
how
do
i
make
them
real
activities
are
those
that
really
make
things
be
without
which
the
things
are
not
and
with
which
they
are
there
activity
so
far
as
we
merely
feel
it
on
the
other
hand
is
only
an
impression
of
ours
it
may
be
maintained
and
an
impression
is
for
all
this
way
of
thinking
only
a
shadow
of
another
fact
arrived
at
this
point
i
can
do
little
more
than
indicate
the
principles
on
which
as
it
seems
to
me
a
radically
empirical
philosophy
is
obliged
to
rely
in
handling
such
a
dispute
if
there
real
creative
activities
in
being
radical
empiricism
must
say
somewhere
they
must
be
immediately
lived
somewhere
the
of
efficacious
causing
and
the
of
it
must
be
experienced
in
one
just
as
the
what
and
the
that
of
are
experienced
in
one
whenever
a
man
has
the
sensation
of
cold
here
and
now
it
boots
not
to
say
that
our
sensations
are
fallible
they
are
indeed
but
to
see
the
thermometer
contradict
us
when
we
say
is
cold
does
not
abolish
cold
as
a
specific
nature
from
the
universe
cold
is
in
the
arctic
circle
if
not
here
even
so
to
feel
that
our
train
is
moving
when
the
train
beside
our
window
moves
to
see
the
moon
through
a
telescope
come
twice
as
near
or
to
see
two
pictures
as
one
solid
when
we
look
through
a
stereoscope
at
them
leaves
motion
nearness
and
solidity
still
in
being
if
not
here
yet
each
in
its
proper
seat
elsewhere
and
wherever
the
seat
of
real
causality
as
ultimately
known
true
in
if
you
will
that
cause
our
feelings
of
activity
as
well
as
the
movements
which
these
seem
to
prompt
a
philosophy
of
pure
experience
can
consider
the
real
causation
as
no
other
of
thing
than
that
which
even
in
our
most
erroneous
experiences
appears
to
be
at
work
exactly
what
appears
there
is
what
we
by
working
though
we
may
later
come
to
learn
that
working
was
not
exactly
sustaining
persevering
striving
paying
with
effort
as
we
go
hanging
on
and
finally
achieving
our
intention
this
action
this
effectuation
in
the
only
shape
in
which
by
a
pure
the
whereabouts
of
it
anywhere
can
be
discussed
here
is
creation
in
its
first
intention
here
is
causality
at
work
to
treat
this
offhand
as
the
bare
illusory
surface
of
a
world
whose
real
causality
is
an
unimaginable
ontological
principle
hidden
in
the
cubic
deeps
is
for
the
more
empirical
way
of
thinking
only
animism
in
another
shape
you
explain
your
given
fact
by
your
but
the
principle
itself
when
you
look
clearly
at
it
turns
out
to
be
nothing
but
a
previous
little
spiritual
copy
of
the
fact
away
from
that
one
and
only
kind
of
fact
your
mind
considering
causality
can
never
get
i
conclude
then
that
real
effectual
causation
as
an
ultimate
nature
as
a
if
you
like
of
reality
is
what
we
feel
it
to
just
that
kind
of
conjunction
which
our
own
reveal
we
have
the
whole
butt
and
being
of
it
in
our
hands
and
the
healthy
thing
for
philosophy
is
to
leave
off
grubbing
underground
for
what
effects
effectuation
or
what
makes
action
act
and
to
try
to
solve
the
concrete
questions
of
where
effectuation
in
this
world
is
located
of
which
things
are
the
true
causal
agents
there
and
of
what
the
more
remote
effects
consist
from
this
point
of
view
the
greater
sublimity
traditionally
attributed
to
the
metaphysical
inquiry
the
grubbing
inquiry
entirely
disappears
if
we
could
know
what
causation
really
and
transcendentally
is
in
itself
the
only
of
the
knowledge
would
be
to
help
us
to
recognize
an
actual
cause
when
we
had
one
and
so
to
track
the
future
course
of
operations
more
intelligently
out
the
mere
abstract
inquiry
into
causation
hidden
nature
is
not
more
sublime
than
any
other
inquiry
equally
abstract
causation
inhabits
no
more
sublime
level
than
anything
else
it
lives
apparently
in
the
dirt
of
the
world
as
well
as
in
the
absolute
or
in
man
unconquerable
mind
the
worth
and
interest
of
the
world
consists
not
in
its
elements
be
these
elements
things
or
be
they
the
conjunctions
of
things
it
exists
rather
in
the
dramatic
outcome
in
the
whole
process
and
in
the
meaning
of
the
succession
stages
which
the
elements
work
out
my
colleague
and
master
josiah
royce
in
a
page
of
his
review
of
stout
has
some
fine
words
on
this
point
with
which
i
cordially
agree
i
can
not
agree
with
his
separating
the
notion
of
efficacy
from
that
of
activity
altogether
this
i
understand
to
be
one
contention
of
his
for
activities
are
efficacious
whenever
they
are
real
activities
at
all
but
the
inner
nature
both
of
efficacy
and
of
activity
are
superficial
problems
i
understand
royce
to
say
and
the
only
point
for
us
in
solving
them
would
be
their
possible
use
in
helping
us
to
solve
the
far
deeper
problem
of
the
course
and
meaning
of
the
world
of
life
life
says
our
colleague
is
full
of
significance
of
meaning
of
success
and
of
defeat
of
hoping
and
of
striving
of
longing
of
desire
and
of
inner
value
it
is
a
total
presence
that
embodies
worth
to
live
our
own
lives
better
in
this
presence
is
the
true
reason
why
we
wish
to
know
the
elements
of
things
so
even
we
psychologists
must
end
on
this
pragmatic
note
the
urgent
problems
of
activity
are
thus
more
concrete
they
are
all
problems
of
the
true
relation
of
to
activities
when
for
example
a
number
of
to
use
the
name
traditional
in
psychology
grow
confluent
in
a
larger
field
of
consciousness
do
the
smaller
activities
still
with
the
wider
activities
then
experienced
by
the
conscious
subject
and
if
so
do
the
wide
activities
accompany
the
narrow
ones
inertly
or
do
they
exert
control
or
do
they
perhaps
utterly
supplant
and
replace
them
and
their
effects
again
when
a
mental
and
a
series
of
activities
both
terminate
in
the
same
muscular
movement
does
the
mental
process
steer
the
neural
processes
or
not
or
on
the
other
hand
does
it
independently
their
effects
such
are
the
questions
that
we
must
begin
with
but
so
far
am
i
from
suggesting
any
definitive
answer
to
such
questions
that
i
hardly
yet
can
put
them
clearly
they
lead
however
into
that
region
of
panpsychic
and
ontologic
speculation
of
which
professors
bergson
and
strong
have
lately
enlarged
the
literature
in
so
able
and
interesting
a
way
the
results
of
these
authors
seem
in
many
respects
dissimilar
and
i
understand
than
as
yet
but
imperfectly
but
i
can
not
help
suspecting
that
the
direction
of
their
work
is
very
promising
and
that
they
have

hunter
instinct
for
the
fruitful
trails

on
activity
in
vol
i
of
his
takes
me
to
task
for
identifying
spiritual
activity
with
certain
muscular
feelings
and
gives
quotations
to
bear
him
out
they
are
from
certain
paragraphs
on
self
in
which
my
attempt
was
to
show
what
the
central
nucleus
of
the
activities
that
we
call
is
of
vol
i
pp
i
found
it
in
certain
intracephalic
movements
which
we
habitually
oppose
as
to
the
activities
of
the
transcorporeal
world
i
sought
to
show
that
there
is
no
direct
evidence
that
we
feel
the
activity
of
an
inner
spiritual
agent
as
such
i
should
now
say
the
activity
of
as
such
see
the
first
essay
consciousness
exist
there
are
in
fact
three
distinguishable
in
the
field
of
discussion
the
elementary
activity
involved
in
the
mere
of
experience
in
the
fact
that
is
going
on
and
the
farther
specification
of
this
into
two
an
activity
felt
as
and
an
activity
ascribed
to
objects
stout
as
i
apprehend
him
identifies
activity
with
that
of
the
total
and
when
i
circumscribe
it
as
a
part
thereof
accuses
me
of
treating
it
as
a
sort
of
external
appendage
to
itself
stout
vol
i
pp
as
if
i
the
activity
from
the
process
which
is
active
but
all
the
processes
in
question
are
active
and
their
activity
is
inseparable
from
their
being
my
book
raised
only
the
question
of
activity
deserved
the
name
of
so
far
as
we
are
and
contrasted
and
opposed
to
an
movements
in
our
body
figure
as
our
activities
and
i
am
unable
to
find
any
other
activities
that
are
ours
in
this
strictly
personal
sense
there
is
a
wider
sense
in
which
the
whole
of
heaven
and
furniture
of
the
earth
and
their
activities
are
ours
for
they
are
our
but
are
here
only
another
name
for
the
total
process
of
experience
another
name
for
all
that
is
in
fact
and
i
was
dealing
with
the
personal
and
individualized
self
exclusively
in
the
passages
with
which
professor
stout
finds
fault
the
individualized
self
which
i
believe
to
be
the
only
thing
properly
called
self
is
a
part
of
the
content
of
the
world
experienced
the
world
experienced
otherwise
called
the
of
consciousness
comes
at
all
times
with
our
body
as
its
centre
centre
of
vision
centre
of
action
centre
of
interest
where
the
body
is
is
when
the
body
acts
is
what
the
body
touches
is
all
other
things
are
and
and
these
words
of
emphasized
position
imply
a
systematization
of
things
with
reference
to
a
focus
of
action
and
interest
which
lies
in
the
body
and
the
systematization
is
now
so
instinctive
was
it
ever
not
so
that
no
developed
or
active
experience
exists
for
us
at
all
except
in
that
ordered
form
so
far
as
and
can
be
active
their
activity
terminates
in
the
activity
of
the
body
and
only
through
first
arousing
its
activities
can
they
begin
to
change
those
of
the
rest
of
the
world
cf
also

the
body
is
the
storm

the
origin
of
the
constant
place
of
stress
in
all
that
everything
circles
round
it
and
is
felt
from
its
point
of
view
the
word
then
is
primarily
a
noun
of
position
just
like
and
activities
attached
to
position
have
prerogative
emphasis
and
if
activities
have
feelings
must
be
felt
in
a
peculiar
way
the
word
designates
the
kind
of
emphasis
i
see
no
inconsistency
whatever
in
defending
on
the
one
hand
activities
as
unique
and
opposed
to
those
of
outer
nature
and
on
the
other
hand
in
affirming
after
introspection
that
they
consist
in
movements

the
head
the
of
them

they
do
so
when
the
activity
is
merely
associational
as
well
as
when

there
but
and
this
is
my
reply
they
do
so
by
other
parts
of
their
nature

those
that
energize

one
thought
in
every
developed

a
desire

acquire

these

which
and

runs

series
in
what
we
term
the
physical
drama
these
qualities
play
absolutely
no
part
the
subject
needs
careful
working
out
but
i
can
see
no
inconsistency
i
have
found
myself
more
than
once
accused
in
print
of
being
the
assertor
of
a
metaphysical
principle
of
activity
since
literary
misunderstandings
retard
the
settlement
of
problems
i
should
like
to
say
that
such
an
interpretation
of
the
pages
i
have
published
on
effort
and
on
will
is
absolutely
foreign
to
what
i
meant
to
express
of
vol

i
owe
all
my
doctrines
on
this
subject
to

of

single
clauses
in
my
writing
or
sentences
read
out
of
their
connection
may
possibly
have
been
compatible
with
a
transphenomenal
principle
of
energy
but
i
defy
anyone
to
show
a
single
sentence
which
taken
with
its
context
should
be
naturally
held
to
advocate
that
view
the
misinterpretation
probably
arose
at
first
from
my
defending
after
renouvier
the
indeterminism
of
our
efforts
will
was
supposed
by
my
critics
to
involve
a
supernatural
agent
as
a
matter
of
plain
history
the
only
will
i
have
ever
thought
of
defending
is
the
character
of
novelty
in
fresh
if
an
is
the
form
of
a
whole
of
consciousness
and
if
each
field
of
consciousness
is
not
only
in
its
totality
unique
as
is
now
commonly
admitted
but
has
its
elements
unique
since
in
that
situation
they
are
all
dyed
in
the
total
then
novelty
is
perpetually
entering
the
world
and
what
happens
there
is
not
pure
as
the
dogma
of
the
literal
uniformity
of
nature
requires
come
in
short
each
with
an
original
touch
a
of
free
will
if
there
were
one
would
doubtless
manifest
itself
in
such
phenomena
but
i
never
saw
nor
do
i
now
see
what
the
principle
could
do
except
rehearse
the
phenomenon
beforehand
or
why
it
ever
should
be
invoked

the
essence
of
humanism
humanism
is
a
ferment
that
has
to
stay
it
is
not
a
single
hypothesis
or
theorem
and
it
dwells
on
no
new
facts
it
is
rather
a
slow
shifting
in
the
philosophic
perspective
making
things
appear
as
from
a
new
centre
of
interest
or
point
of
sight
some
writers
are
strongly
conscious
of
the
shifting
others
half
unconscious
even
though
their
own
vision
may
have
undergone
much
change
the
result
is
no
small
confusion
in
debate
the
humanists
often
taking
part
against
the
radical
ones
as
if
they
wished
to
count
upon
the
other
side
if
humanism
really
be
the
name
for
such
a
shifting
of
perspective
it
is
obvious
that
the
whole
scene
of
the
philosophic
stage
will
change
in
some
degree
if
humanism
prevails
the
emphasis
of
things
their
foreground
and
background
distribution
their
sizes
and
values
will
not
keep
just
the
same
if
such
pervasive
consequences
be
involved
in
humanism
it
is
clear
that
no
pains
which
philosophers
may
take
first
in
defining
it
and
then
in
furthering
checking
or
steering
its
progress
will
be
thrown
away
it
suffers
badly
at
present
from
incomplete
definition
its
most
systematic
advocates
schiller
and
dewey
have
published
fragmentary
programs
only
and
its
bearing
on
many
vital
philosophic
problems
has
not
been
traced
except
by
adversaries
who
scenting
heresies
in
advance
have
showered
blows
on
doctrines
subjectivism
and
scepticism
for
example
that
no
good
humanist
finds
it
necessary
to
entertain
by
their
still
greater
reticences
the
have
in
turn
perplexed
the
humanists
much
of
the
controversy
has
involved
the
word
it
is
always
good
in
debate
to
know
your
adversary
point
of
view
authentically
but
the
critics
of
humanism
never
define
exactly
what
the
word
signifies
when
they
use
it
themselves
the
humanists
have
to
guess
at
their
view
and
the
result
has
doubtless
been
much
beating
of
the
air
add
to
all
this
great
individual
differences
in
both
camps
and
it
becomes
clear
that
nothing
is
so
urgently
needed
at
the
stage
which
things
have
reached
at
present
as
a
sharper
definition
by
each
side
of
its
central
point
of
view
whoever
will
contribute
any
touch
of
sharpness
will
help
us
to
make
sure
of
what
what
and
who
is
who
anyone
can
contribute
such
a
definition
and
without
it
no
one
knows
exactly
where
he
stands
if
i
offer
my
own
provisional
definition
of
humanism
now
and
here
others
may
improve
it
some
adversary
may
be
led
to
define
his
own
creed
more
sharply
by
the
contrast
and
a
certain
quickening
of
the
crystallization
of
general
opinion
may
result
i
the
essential
service
of
humanism
as
i
conceive
the
situation
is
to
have
seen
that
one
part
of
our
experience
may
lean
upon
another
part
to
make
it
what
it
is
in
any
one
of
several
aspects
in
which
it
may
be
considered
experience
as
a
whole
is
and
leans
on
since
this
formula
also
expresses
the
main
contention
of
transcendental
idealism
it
needs
abundant
explication
to
make
it
unambiguous
it
seems
at
first
sight
to
confine
itself
to
denying
theism
and
pantheism
but
in
fact
it
need
not
deny
either
everything
would
depend
on
the
exegesis
and
if
the
formula
ever
became
canonical
it
would
certainly
develop
both
and
interpreters
i
myself
read
humanism
theistically
and
pluralistically
if
there
be
a
god
he
is
no
absolute
but
simply
the
experiencer
of
widest
actual
conscious
span
read
thus
humanism
is
for
me
a
religion
susceptible
of
reasoned
defence
though
i
am
well
aware
how
many
minds
there
are
to
whom
it
can
appeal
religiously
only
when
it
has
been
monistically
translated
ethically
the
pluralistic
form
of
it
takes
for
me
a
stronger
hold
on
reality
than
any
other
philosophy
i
know
of
it
being
essentially
a
philosophy
a
philosophy
of
in
which
conjunctions
do
the
work
but
my
primary
reason
for
advocating
it
is
its
matchless
intellectual
economy
it
gets
rid
not
only
of
the
standing
that
monism
engenders
of
evil
of
freedom
and
the
like
but
of
other
metaphysical
mysteries
and
paradoxes
as
well
it
gets
rid
for
example
of
the
whole
agnostic
controversy
by
refusing
to
entertain
the
hypothesis
of
reality
at
all
it
gets
rid
of
any
need
for
an
absolute
of
the
bradleyan
type
avowedly
sterile
for
intellectual
purposes
by
insisting
that
the
conjunctive
relations
found
within
experience
are
faultlessly
real
it
gets
rid
of
the
need
of
an
absolute
of
the
roycean
type
similarly
sterile
by
its
pragmatic
treatment
of
the
problem
of
knowledge
a
treatment
of
which
i
have
already
given
a
version
in
two
very
inadequate
articles
as
the
views
of
knowledge
reality
and
truth
imputed
to
humanism
have
been
those
so
far
most
fiercely
attacked
it
is
in
regard
to
these
ideas
that
a
sharpening
of
focus
seems
most
urgently
required
i
proceed
therefore
to
bring
the
views
which
impute
to
humanism
in
these
respects
into
focus
as
briefly
as
i
can
ii
if
the
central
humanistic
thesis
printed
above
in
italics
be
accepted
it
will
follow
that
if
there
be
any
such
thing
at
all
as
knowing
the
knower
and
the
object
known
must
both
be
portions
of
experience
one
part
of
experience
must
therefore
either
know
another
part
of
experience
in
other
words
parts
must
as
professor
woodbridge
says
represent
instead
of
representing
realities
outside
of
this
case
is
that
of
conceptual
knowledge
or
else
they
must
simply
exist
as
so
many
ultimate
or
facts
of
being
in
the
first
instance
and
then
as
a
secondary
complication
and
without
doubling
up
its
entitative
any
one
and
the
same
must
figure
alternately
as
a
thing
known
and
as
a
knowledge
of
the
thing
by
reason
of
two
divergent
kinds
of
context
into
which
in
the
general
course
of
experience
it
gets
woven
this
second
case
is
that
of
there
is
a
stage
of
thought
that
goes
beyond
common
sense
and
of
it
i
shall
say
more
presently
but
the
stage
is
a
perfectly
definite
of
thought
primarily
for
purposes
of
action
and
so
long
as
we
remain
on
the
stage
of
thought
object
and
subject
in
the
fact
of
or
the
pen
and
hand
which
i
now
writing
for
example
the
physical
realities
which
those
words
designate
in
this
case
there
is
no
implied
in
the
knowing
humanism
here
is
only
a
more
comminuted
in
case
on
the
contrary
the
representative
experience
does
transcend
itself
in
knowing
the
other
experience
that
is
its
object
no
one
can
talk
of
the
knowledge
of
the
one
by
the
other
without
seeing
them
as
numerically
distinct
entities
of
which
the
one
lies
beyond
the
other
and
away
from
it
along
some
direction
and
with
some
interval
that
can
be
definitely
named
but
if
the
talker
be
a
humanist
he
must
also
see
this
concretely
and
pragmatically
and
confess
it
to
consist
of
other
intervening
experiences
of
possible
ones
at
all
events
if
not
of
actual
to
call
my
present
idea
of
my
dog
for
example
cognitive
of
the
real
dog
means
that
as
the
actual
tissue
of
experience
is
constituted
the
idea
is
capable
of
leading
into
a
chain
of
other
experiences
on
my
part
that
go
from
next
to
next
and
terminate
at
last
in
vivid
of
a
jumping
barking
hairy
body
those
the
real
dog
the
dog
full
presence
for
my
common
sense
if
the
supposed
talker
is
a
profound
philosopher
although
they
may
not
the
real
dog
for
him
they
the
real
dog
are
practical
substitutes
for
the
real
dog
as
the
representation
was
a
practical
substitute
for
them
that
real
dog
being
a
lot
of
atoms
say
or
of
that
lie
the
lie
in
his
experience
as
well
as
in
my
own
iii
the
philosopher
here
stands
for
the
stage
of
thought
that
goes
beyond
the
stage
of
common
sense
and
the
difference
is
simply
that
he
and
where
common
sense
does
not
for
common
sense
two
men
see
the
same
identical
real
dog
philosophy
noting
actual
differences
in
their
perceptions
points
out
the
duality
of
these
latter
and
interpolates
something
between
them
as
a
more
real
terminus
first
organs
viscera
etc
next
cells
then
ultimate
atoms
lastly
perhaps
the
original
of
the
two
men
instead
of
coalescing
with
each
other
and
with
the
real
as
at
first
supposed
are
thus
held
by
philosophers
to
be
separated
by
invisible
realities
with
which
at
most
they
are
conterminous
abolish
now
one
of
the
percipients
and
the
interpolation
changes
into
the
of
the
remaining
percipient
is
regarded
by
the
philosopher
as
not
quite
reaching
reality
he
has
only
carried
the
procession
of
experiences
the
philosopher
thinks
to
a
definite
because
practical
somewhere
on
the
way
towards
an
absolute
truth
that
lies
beyond
the
humanist
sees
all
the
time
however
that
there
is
no
absolute
transcendency
even
about
the
more
absolute
realities
thus
conjectured
or
believed
in
the
viscera
and
cells
are
only
possible
percepts
following
upon
that
of
the
outer
body
the
atoms
again
though
we
may
never
attain
to
human
means
of
perceiving
them
are
still
defined
perceptually
the
itself
is
conceived
as
a
kind
of
experience
and
it
is
possible
to
frame
the
hypothesis
such
hypotheses
can
by
no
logic
be
excluded
from
philosophy
of
two
knowers
of
a
piece
of
and
the
itself
becoming
at
the
moment
at
which
our
imperfect
knowing
might
pass
into
knowing
of
a
completed
type
even
so
do
you
and
i
habitually
represent
our
two
perceptions
and
the
real
dog
as
confluent
though
only
provisionally
and
for
the
stage
of
thought
if
my
pen
be
inwardly
made
of
there
is
no
confluence
between
that
and
my
visual
perception
of
the
pen
but
conceivably
there
might
come
to
be
such
confluence
for
in
the
case
of
my
hand
the
visual
sensations
and
the
inward
feelings
of
the
hand
its
so
to
speak
are
even
now
as
confluent
as
any
two
things
can
be
there
is
thus
no
breach
in
humanistic
epistemology
whether
knowledge
be
taken
as
ideally
perfected
or
only
as
true
enough
to
pass
muster
for
practice
it
is
hung
on
one
continuous
scheme
reality
howsoever
remote
is
always
defined
as
a
terminus
within
the
general
possibilities
of
experience
and
what
knows
it
is
defined
as
an
experience
it
in
the
sense
of
being
substitutable
for
it
in
our
because
it
leads
to
the
same
associates
in
the
sense
of
to
through
a
chain
of
other
experiences
that
either
intervene
or
may
intervene
absolute
reality
here
bears
the
same
relation
to
sensation
as
sensation
bears
to
conception
or
imagination
both
are
provisional
or
final
termini
sensation
being
only
the
terminus
at
which
the
practical
man
habitually
stops
while
the
philosopher
projects
a
in
the
shape
of
more
absolute
reality
these
termini
for
the
practical
and
the
philosophical
stages
of
thought
respectively
are
they
are
not
of
anything
else
they
simply
are
they
on
nothing
as
my
italicized
formula
said
rather
does
the
whole
fabric
of
experience
lean
on
them
just
as
the
whole
fabric
of
the
solar
system
including
many
relative
positions
leans
for
its
absolute
position
in
space
on
any
one
of
its
constituent
stars
here
again
one
gets
a
new
in
pluralistic
form
iv
if
i
have
succeeded
in
making
this
at
all
clear
though
i
fear
that
brevity
and
abstractness
between
them
may
have
made
me
fail
the
reader
will
see
that
the
of
our
mental
operations
must
always
be
an
affair
a
conception
is
reckoned
true
by
common
sense
when
it
can
be
made
to
lead
to
a
sensation
the
sensation
which
for
common
sense
is
not
so
much
as
is
held
to
be
true
by
the
philosopher
just
in
so
far
as
it
abuts
at
or
occupies
the
place
of
a
still
more
absolutely
real
experience
in
the
possibility
of
which
to
some
remoter
experient
the
philosopher
finds
reason
to
believe
meanwhile
what
actually
count
for
true
to
any
individual
trower
whether
he
be
philosopher
or
common
man
is
always
a
result
of
his
if
a
novel
experience
conceptual
or
sensible
contradict
too
emphatically
our
system
of
beliefs
in
cases
out
of
a
hundred
it
is
treated
as
false
only
when
the
older
and
the
newer
experiences
are
congruous
enough
to
mutually
apperceive
and
modify
each
other
does
what
we
treat
as
an
advance
in
truth
result
having
written
of
this
point
in
an
article
in
reply
to
joseph
criticism
of
my
humanism
i
will
say
no
more
about
truth
here
but
refer
the
reader
to
that
review
in
no
case
however
need
truth
consist
in
a
relation
between
our
experiences
and
something
archetypal
or
should
we
ever
reach
absolutely
terminal
experiences
experiences
in
which
we
all
agreed
which
were
superseded
by
no
revised
continuations
these
would
not
be
they
would
be
they
would
simply
and
be
indeed
the
angles
corners
and
linchpins
of
all
reality
on
which
the
truth
of
everything
else
would
be
stayed
only
such
things
as
led
to
these
by
satisfactory
conjunctions
would
be
satisfactory
connection
of
some
sort
with
such
termini
is
all
that
the
word
means
on
the
stage
of
thought
serve
as
such
termini
our
ideas
and
concepts
and
scientific
theories
pass
for
true
only
so
far
as
they
harmoniously
lead
back
to
the
world
of
sense
i
hope
that
many
humanists
will
endorse
this
attempt
of
mine
to
trace
the
more
essential
features
of
that
way
of
viewing
things
i
feel
almost
certain
that
dewey
and
schiller
will
do
so
if
the
attackers
will
also
take
some
slight
account
of

it
may
be

la
notion
de
conscience
je
voudrais
vous
communiquer
quelques
doutes
qui
me
sont
venus
au
sujet
de
la
notion
de
conscience
qui
règne
dans
tous
nos
traités
de
psychologie
on
définit
habituellement
la
psychologie
comme
la
science
des
faits
de
conscience
ou
des
ou
encore
des
de
la
conscience
admette
se
rattache
à
des
personnels
ou
bien
la
croie
impersonnelle
à
la
façon
du
moi
transcendental
de
kant
de
la
ou
du
de
nos
contemporains
en
allemagne
cette
conscience
est
toujours
regardée
comme
possédant
une
essence
propre
absolument
distincte
de
des
choses
matérielles
a
le
don
mystérieux
de
représenter
et
de
connaître
les
faits
matériels
pris
dans
leur
matérialité
ne
sont
pas
ne
sont
pas
objets
ne
se
pas
pour
prennent
la
forme
du
système
dans
lequel
nous
nous
sentons
vivre
il
faut
et
ce
fait
surajouté
à
leur
existence
brute
la
conscience
que
nous
en
avons
ou
selon
panpsychiste
ont
voilà
ce
dualisme
invétéré
semble
impossible
de
chasser
de
notre
vue
du
monde
ce
monde
peut
bien
exister
en
soi
mais
nous
savons
rien
car
pour
nous
il
est
exclusivement
un
objet
et
la
condition
indispensable
à
cet
effet
soit
rapporté
à
des
témoins
soit
connu
par
un
sujet
ou
par
des
sujets
spirituels
objet
et
sujet
voilà
les
deux
jambes
sans
lesquelles
il
semble
que
la
philosophie
ne
saurait
faire
un
pas
en
avant
toutes
les
écoles
sont
scolastique
cartésianisme
kantisme
tous
admettent
le
dualisme
fondamental
le
positivisme
ou
agnosticisme
de
nos
jours
qui
se
pique
de
relever
des
sciences
naturelles
se
donne
volontiers
il
est
vrai
le
nom
de
monisme
mais
ce
monisme
verbal
il
pose
une
réalité
inconnue
mais
nous
dit
que
cette
réalité
se
présente
toujours
sous
deux
aspects
un
côté
conscience
et
un
côté
matière
et
ces
deux
côtés
demeurent
aussi
irréductibles
que
les
attributs
fondamentaux
étendue
et
pensée
du
dieu
de
spinoza
au
fond
le
monisme
contemporain
est
du
spinozisme
pur
or
comment
se
cette
conscience
dont
nous
sommes
tous
si
portés
à
admettre
impossible
de
la
définir
nous
mais
nous
en
avons
tous
une
intuition
immédiate
tout
la
conscience
a
conscience
demandez
à
la
première
personne
que
vous
rencontrerez
homme
ou
femme
psychologue
ou
ignorant
et
elle
vous
répondra
penser
jouir
souffrir
vouloir
tout
comme
elle
se
sent
respirer
elle
perçoit
directement
sa
vie
spirituelle
comme
une
espèce
de
courant
intérieur
actif
léger
fluide
délicat
diaphane
pour
ainsi
dire
et
absolument
opposé
à
quoi
que
ce
soit
de
matériel
bref
la
vie
subjective
ne
paraît
pas
seulement
être
une
condition
logiquement
indispensable
pour
y
ait
un
monde
objectif
qui
encore
un
élément
de
même
que
nous
éprouvons
directement
au
même
titre
que
nous
éprouvons
notre
propre
corps
idées
et
choses
comment
donc
ne
pas
reconnaître
leur
dualisme
sentiments
et
objets
comment
douter
de
leur
hétérogénéité
absolue
la
psychologie
scientifique
admet
cette
hétérogénéité
comme
psychologie
spiritualiste
comment
ne
pas
chaque
science
découpe
arbitrairement
dans
la
trame
des
faits
un
champ
où
elle
se
parque
et
dont
elle
décrit
et
étudie
le
contenu
la
psychologie
prend
justement
pour
son
domaine
le
champ
des
faits
de
conscience
elle
les
postule
sans
les
critiquer
elle
les
oppose
aux
faits
matériels
et
sans
critiquer
non
plus
la
notion
de
ces
derniers
elle
les
rattache
à
la
conscience
par
le
lien
mystérieux
de
la
de
qui
pour
elle
est
un
troisième
genre
de
fait
fondamental
et
ultime
en
suivant
cette
voie
la
psychologie
contemporaine
a
fêté
de
grands
triomphes
elle
a
pu
faire
une
esquisse
de
de
la
vie
consciente
en
concevant
cette
dernière
comme
de
plus
en
plus
complètement
au
milieu
physique
environnant
elle
a
pu
établir
un
parallélisme
dans
le
dualisme
celui
des
faits
psychiques
et
des
événements
cérébraux
elle
a
expliqué
les
illusions
les
hallucinations
et
un
certain
point
les
maladies
mentales
ce
sont
de
beaux
progrès
mais
il
reste
encore
bien
des
problèmes
la
philosophie
générale
surtout
qui
a
pour
devoir
de
scruter
tous
les
postulats
trouve
des
paradoxes
et
des
empêchements
là
où
la
science
passe
outre
et
il
a
que
les
amateurs
de
science
populaire
qui
ne
sont
jamais
perplexes
plus
on
va
au
fond
des
choses
plus
on
trouve
et
pour
ma
part
que
depuis
que
je
sérieusement
de
psychologie
ce
vieux
dualisme
de
matière
et
de
pensée
cette
hétérogénéité
posée
comme
absolue
des
deux
essences
toujours
présenté
des
difficultés
de
de
ces
difficultés
que
je
voudrais
maintenant
vous
entretenir
il
y
en
a
une
laquelle
suis
convaincu
vous
aura
frappés
tous
prenons
la
perception
extérieure
la
sensation
directe
que
nous
donnent
par
exemple
les
murs
de
cette
salle
dire
ici
que
le
psychique
et
le
physique
sont
absolument
hétérogènes
au
contraire
ils
sont
si
peu
hétérogènes
que
si
nous
nous
plaçons
au
point
de
vue
du
sens
commun
si
nous
faisons
abstraction
de
toutes
les
inventions
explicatives
des
molécules
et
des
ondulations
éthérées
par
exemple
qui
au
fond
sont
des
entités
métaphysiques
si
en
un
mot
nous
prenons
la
réalité
naïvement
et
telle
nous
est
donnée
tout
cette
réalité
sensible
dépendent
nos
intérêts
vitaux
et
sur
laquelle
se
portent
toutes
nos
actions
eh
bien
cette
réalité
sensible
et
la
sensation
que
nous
en
avons
sont
au
moment
où
la
sensation
se
produit
absolument
identiques
à
la
réalité
est
même
les
mots
murs
de
cette
salle
ne
signifient
que
cette
blancheur
fraîche
et
sonore
qui
nous
entoure
coupée
par
ces
fenêtres
bornée
par
ces
lignes
et
ces
angles
le
physique
ici
pas
contenu
que
le
psychique
le
sujet
et
se
confondent
berkeley
qui
le
premier
a
mis
cette
vérité
en
honneur
est
nos
sensations
ne
sont
pas
de
petits
duplicats
intérieurs
des
choses
elles
sont
les
choses
mêmes
en
tant
que
les
choses
nous
sont
présentes
et
quoi
que
veuille
penser
de
la
vie
absente
cachée
et
pour
ainsi
dire
privée
des
choses
et
quelles
que
soient
les
constructions
hypothétiques
en
fasse
il
reste
vrai
que
la
vie
publique
des
choses
cette
actualité
présente
par
laquelle
elles
nous
confrontent
dérivent
toutes
nos
constructions
théoriques
et
à
laquelle
elles
doivent
toutes
revenir
et
se
rattacher
sous
peine
de
flotter
dans
et
dans
cette
actualité
est
homogène
et
non
pas
seulement
homogène
mais
numériquement
une
avec
une
certaine
partie
de
notre
vie
intérieure
voilà
pour
la
perception
extérieure
quand
on
à
à
la
mémoire
ou
aux
facultés
de
représentation
abstraite
bien
que
les
faits
soient
ici
beaucoup
plus
compliqués
je
crois
que
la
même
homogénéité
essentielle
se
dégage
pour
simplifier
le
problème
excluons
toute
réalité
sensible
prenons
la
pensée
pure
telle
dans
le
rêve
ou
la
rêverie
ou
dans
la
mémoire
du
passé
ici
encore
de
ne
pas
double
emploi
le
physique
et
le
psychique
ne
se
pas
si
je
rêve
montagne
elle
sans
doute
pas
en
dehors
du
rêve
mais
le
rêve
elle
est
de
nature
ou
parfaitement
physique
physique
si
en
ce
moment
je
me
permets
de
me
souvenir
de
ma
maison
en
amérique
et
des
détails
de
mon
embarquement
récent
pour
le
phénomène
pur
le
fait
qui
se
produit
ma
pensée
avec
son
contenu
mais
encore
ce
contenu
il
porte
la
forme
partie
du
monde
réel
partie
distante
il
est
vrai
de
six
mille
kilomètres
et
de
six
semaines
de
temps
mais
reliée
à
la
salle
où
nous
sommes
par
une
foule
de
choses
objets
et
événements
homogènes
part
avec
la
salle
et
part
avec
de
mes
souvenirs
ce
contenu
ne
se
donne
pas
comme
étant
un
tout
petit
fait
intérieur
que
je
projetterais
ensuite
au
loin
il
se
présente
comme
le
fait
éloigné
même
et
de
penser
ce
contenu
la
conscience
que
ai
que
au
fond
autre
chose
que
des
manières
rétrospectives
de
nommer
le
contenu
séparé
de
tous
ces
intermédiaires
physiques
et
relié
à
un
nouveau
groupe
qui
le
font
rentrer
dans
ma
vie
mentale
les
émotions
par
exemple
a
éveillées
en
moi
que
porte
mes
idées
de
tout
à
qui
suscité
comme
souvenir
ce
se
rapportant
à
ces
derniers
associés
que
le
phénomène
arrive
à
être
classé
comme
tant
ne
se
rapporte
premiers
il
demeure
phénomène
il
est
vrai
que
nous
opposons
habituellement
nos
images
intérieures
aux
objets
et
que
nous
les
considérons
comme
de
petites
copies
comme
des
calques
ou
doubles
affaiblis
de
ces
derniers
objet
présent
a
une
vivacité
et
une
netteté
supérieures
à
celles
de
il
lui
fait
ainsi
contraste
et
pour
me
servir
de
mot
de
taine
il
lui
sert
de
quand
les
deux
sont
présents
ensemble
prend
le
premier
plan
et
recule
devient
une
chose
absente
mais
cet
objet
présent
en
de
quelle
étoffe
fait
de
la
même
étoffe
que
il
est
fait
de
il
est
chose
perçue
son
est
et
lui
et
sont
génériquement
homogènes
si
je
pense
en
ce
moment
à
mon
chapeau
que
laissé
tout
à
au
vestiaire
où
est
le
dualisme
le
discontinu
entre
le
chapeau
pensé
et
le
chapeau
réel
vrai
que
mon
esprit
tiens
compte
pratiquement
comme
réalité
était
présent
sur
cette
table
le
chapeau
déterminerait
un
mouvement
de
ma
main
je
de
même
ce
chapeau
conçu
ce
chapeau
en
idée
déterminera
tantôt
la
direction
de
mes
pas
le
prendre
que
ai
se
continuera
la
présence
sensible
du
chapeau
et
fondra
harmonieusement
je
conclus
donc
que
bien
y
ait
un
dualisme
pratique
puisque
les
images
se
distinguent
des
objets
en
tiennent
lieu
et
nous
y
mènent
il
a
pas
lieu
de
leur
attribuer
une
différence
de
nature
essentielle
pensée
et
actualité
sont
faites
seule
et
même
étoffe
qui
est
de
en

la
psychologie
de
la
perception
extérieure
nous
mène
à
la
même
conclusion
quand
devant
moi
comme
une
table
de
telle
forme
à
telle
distance
on
que
ce
fait
est
dû
à
deux
facteurs
à
une
matière
de
sensation
qui
me
pénètre
par
la
voie
des
yeux
et
qui
donne
réelle
et
à
des
idées
qui
se
réveillent
vont
à
la
rencontre
de
cette
réalité
la
classent
et
mais
qui
peut
faire
la
part
dans
la
table
concrètement
aperçue
de
ce
qui
est
sensation
et
de
ce
qui
est
idée
et
et
se
fusionnent
et
font
un
mariage
indissoluble
cela
rappelle
ces
panoramas
circulaires
où
des
objets
réels
rochers
herbe
chariots
brisés
qui
occupent
sont
si
ingénieusement
reliés
à
la
toile
qui
fait
le
fond
et
qui
représente
une
bataille
ou
un
vaste
paysage
que
ne
sait
plus
distinguer
ce
qui
est
objet
de
ce
qui
est
peinture
les
coutures
et
les
joints
sont
imperceptibles
cela
advenir
si
et
étaient
absolument
dissemblables
de
nature
je
suis
convaincu
que
des
considérations
pareilles
à
celles
que
je
viens
auront
déjà
suscité
chez
vous
aussi
des
doutes
au
sujet
du
dualisme
prétendu
et
raisons
de
douter
surgissent
encore
il
y
a
toute
une
sphère
et
qui
ne
sont
ni
objectifs
ni
subjectifs
manière
exclusive
mais
que
nous
employons
tantôt
manière
et
tantôt
autre
comme
si
nous
nous
complaisions
dans
leur
ambiguïté
je
parle
des
qualités
que
nous
pour
ainsi
dire
dans
les
choses
leur
côté
esthétique
moral
leur
valeur
pour
nous
la
beauté
par
exemple
où
dans
la
statue
dans
la
sonate
ou
dans
notre
esprit
mon
collègue
à
harvard
george
santayana
a
écrit
un
livre
où
il
appelle
la
beauté
le
plaisir
objectifié
et
en
vérité
bien
ici
pourrait
parler
de
projection
au
dehors
on
dit
indifféremment
une
chaleur
agréable
ou
une
sensation
agréable
de
chaleur
la
rareté
le
précieux
du
diamant
nous
en
paraissent
des
qualités
essentielles
nous
parlons
orage
affreux
homme
haïssable
action
indigne
et
nous
croyons
parler
objectivement
bien
que
ces
termes
que
des
rapports
à
notre
sensibilité
émotive
propre
nous
disons
même
un
chemin
pénible
un
ciel
triste
un
coucher
de
soleil
superbe
toute
cette
manière
animiste
de
regarder
les
choses
qui
paraît
avoir
été
la
façon
primitive
de
penser
des
hommes
peut
très
bien
et
santayana
dans
un
autre
livre
tout
récent
bien
expliquée
ainsi
par
à
ce
que
nous
ressentons
en
sa
présence
le
partage
du
subjectif
et
de
est
le
fait
réflexion
très
avancée
que
nous
aimons
encore
ajourner
dans
beaucoup
quand
les
besoins
pratiques
ne
nous
en
tirent
pas
forcément
il
semble
que
nous
aimons
à
nous
bercer
dans
le
vague
les
qualités
secondes
chaleur
son
lumière
encore
attribution
vague
pour
le
sens
commun
pour
la
vie
pratique
elles
sont
absolument
objectives
physiques
pour
le
physicien
elles
sont
subjectives
pour
lui
il
a
que
la
forme
la
masse
le
mouvement
qui
aient
une
réalité
extérieure
pour
le
philosophe
idéaliste
au
contraire
forme
et
mouvement
sont
tout
aussi
subjectifs
que
lumière
et
chaleur
et
il
a
que
la
inconnue
le
noumène
qui
jouisse
réalité
extramentale
complète
nos
sensations
intimes
conservent
encore
de
cette
ambiguïté
il
y
a
des
illusions
de
mouvement
qui
prouvent
que
nos
premières
sensations
de
mouvement
étaient
généralisées
le
monde
entier
avec
nous
qui
se
mouvait
maintenant
nous
distinguons
notre
propre
mouvement
de
celui
des
objets
qui
nous
entourent
et
parmi
les
objets
nous
en
distinguons
qui
demeurent
en
repos
mais
il
est
des
états
de
vertige
où
nous
retombons
encore
dans
première
vous
connaissez
tous
sans
doute
cette
théorie
qui
a
voulu
faire
des
émotions
des
sommes
de
sensations
viscérales
et
musculaires
elle
a
donné
lieu
à
bien
des
controverses
et
aucune
opinion
encore
conquis
des
suffrages
vous
connaissez
aussi
les
controverses
sur
la
nature
de
mentale
les
uns
soutiennent
est
une
force
purement
spirituelle
que
nous
sommes
en
état
immédiatement
comme
telle
les
autres
prétendent
que
ce
que
nous
nommons
activité
mentale
effort
attention
par
exemple
que
le
reflet
senti
de
certains
effets
dont
notre
organisme
est
le
siège
tensions
musculaires
au
crâne
et
au
gosier
arrêt
ou
passage
de
la
respiration
afflux
de
sang
etc
de
quelque
manière
que
se
résolvent
ces
controverses
leur
existence
prouve
bien
clairement
une
chose
est
très
difficile
ou
même
absolument
impossible
de
savoir
par
la
seule
inspection
intime
de
certains
phénomènes
sont
de
nature
physique
occupant
de
ou
sont
de
nature
purement
psychique
et
intérieure
il
nous
faut
toujours
trouver
des
raisons
pour
appuyer
notre
avis
il
nous
faut
chercher
la
classification
la
plus
probable
du
phénomène
et
en
fin
de
compte
il
pourrait
bien
se
trouver
que
toutes
nos
classifications
usuelles
eussent
eu
leurs
motifs
plutôt
dans
les
besoins
de
la
pratique
que
dans
quelque
faculté
que
nous
aurions
deux
essences
ultimes
et
diverses
qui
composeraient
ensemble
la
trame
des
choses
le
corps
de
chacun
de
nous
offre
un
contraste
pratique
presque
violent
à
tout
le
reste
du
milieu
ambiant
tout
ce
qui
arrive
au
dedans
de
ce
corps
nous
est
plus
intime
et
important
que
ce
qui
arrive
ailleurs
il
avec
notre
moi
il
se
classe
avec
lui
ame
vie
souffle
qui
saurait
bien
les
distinguer
exactement
même
nos
images
et
nos
souvenirs
qui
sur
le
monde
physique
que
par
le
moyen
de
notre
corps
semblent
appartenir
à
ce
dernier
nous
les
traitons
comme
internes
nous
les
classons
avec
nos
sentiments
affectifs
il
faut
bien
avouer
en
somme
que
la
question
du
dualisme
de
la
pensée
et
de
la
matière
est
bien
loin
finalement
résolue
et
voilà
terminée
la
première
partie
de
mon
discours
voulu
vous
pénétrer
mesdames
et
messieurs
de
mes
doutes
et
de
la
réalité
aussi
bien
que
de
du
problème
quant
à
moi
après
de
longues
années
fini
par
prendre
mon
parti
carrément
je
crois
que
la
conscience
telle
se
la
représente
communément
soit
comme
entité
soit
comme
activité
pure
mais
en
tout
cas
comme
fluide
inétendue
diaphane
vide
de
tout
contenu
propre
mais
se
connaissant
directement
spirituelle
enfin
je
crois
que
cette
conscience
est
une
pure
chimère
et
que
la
somme
de
réalités
concrètes
que
le
mot
conscience
devrait
couvrir
mérite
une
toute
autre
description
description
du
reste
philosophie
attentive
aux
faits
et
sachant
faire
un
peu
serait
désormais
en
état
de
fournir
ou
plutôt
de
commencer
à
fournir
et
ces
mots
à
la
seconde
partie
de
mon
discours
elle
sera
beaucoup
plus
courte
que
la
première
parce
que
si
je
la
développais
sur
la
même
échelle
elle
serait
beaucoup
trop
longue
il
faut
par
conséquent
que
je
me
restreigne
aux
seules
indications
indispensables
admettons
que
la
conscience
la
conçue
comme
essence
entité
activité
moitié
irréductible
de
chaque
expérience
soit
supprimée
que
le
dualisme
fondamental
et
pour
ainsi
dire
ontologique
soit
aboli
et
que
ce
que
nous
supposions
exister
soit
seulement
ce
a
appelé
le
le
de
la
conscience
comment
la
philosophie
se
tirer
avec
de
monisme
vague
qui
en
résultera
je
vais
tâcher
de
vous
insinuer
quelques
suggestions
positives
bien
que
je
craigne
que
faute
du
développement
nécessaire
mes
idées
ne
répandront
pas
une
clarté
très
grande
pourvu
que
un
commencement
de
sentier
ce
sera
assez
au
fond
pourquoi
nous
manière
si
tenace
à
cette
idée
conscience
surajoutée
à
du
contenu
des
choses
pourquoi
la
si
fortement
que
celui
qui
la
nierait
nous
semblerait
plutôt
un
mauvais
plaisant
penseur
pas
pour
sauver
ce
fait
indéniable
que
le
contenu
de
pas
seulement
une
existence
propre
et
comme
immanente
et
intrinsèque
mais
que
chaque
partie
de
ce
contenu
déteint
pour
ainsi
dire
sur
ses
voisines
rend
compte
à
sort
en
quelque
sorte
de
soi
pour
être
sue
et
tout
le
champ
de
se
trouve
être
transparent
de
part
en
part
ou
constitué
comme
un
espace
qui
serait
rempli
de
miroirs
cette
bilatéralité
des
parties
de
à
savoir
part
avec
des
qualités
propres
part
sont
rapportées
à
parties
et
régnante
la
constate
et
par
un
dualisme
fondamental
de
constitution
appartenant
à
chaque
morceau
en
propre
dans
cette
feuille
de
papier
il
a
pas
seulement
le
contenu
blancheur
minceur
mais
il
y
a
ce
second
fait
de
la
conscience
de
cette
blancheur
et
de
cette
minceur
cette
fonction
rapporté
de
faire
partie
de
la
trame
entière
expérience
plus
compréhensive
on
en
fait
ontologique
et
on
loge
ce
fait
dans
même
du
papier
en
à
sa
blancheur
et
à
sa
minceur
ce
pas
un
rapport
extrinsèque
suppose
une
moitié
du
phénomène
même
je
crois
somme
on
se
représente
la
réalité
comme
constituée
de
la
façon
dont
sont
faites
les
couleurs
qui
nous
servent
à
la
peinture
il
y
a
des
matières
colorantes
qui
répondent
au
contenu
et
il
y
a
un
véhicule
huile
ou
colle
qui
les
tient
en
suspension
et
qui
répond
à
la
conscience
un
dualisme
complet
où
en
employant
certains
procédés
on
peut
séparer
chaque
élément
de
par
voie
de
soustraction
ainsi
nous
assure
faisant
un
grand
effort
introspective
nous
pouvons
saisir
notre
conscience
sur
le
vif
comme
une
activité
spirituelle
pure
en
négligeant
à
peu
près
complètement
les
matières
un
moment
donné
elle
éclaire
maintenant
je
vous
demande
si
on
ne
pourrait
pas
tout
aussi
bien
renverser
absolument
cette
manière
de
voir
supposons
en
effet
que
la
réalité
première
soit
de
nature
neutre
et
par
quelque
nom
encore
ambigu
comme
parle
volontiers
au
pluriel
et
je
lui
donne
le
nom
ce
sera
un
monisme
si
vous
voulez
mais
un
monisme
tout
à
fait
rudimentaire
et
absolument
opposé
au
monisme
bilatéral
du
positivisme
scientifique
ou
spinoziste
ces
expériences
pures
existent
et
se
succèdent
entrent
dans
des
rapports
infiniment
variés
les
unes
avec
les
autres
rapports
qui
sont
des
parties
essentielles
de
la
trame
des
expériences
il
y
a
conscience
de
ces
rapports
au
même
titre
y
a
conscience
de
leurs
termes
il
en
résulte
que
des
se
font
remarquer
et
distinguer
et
seule
et
même
expérience
vu
la
grande
variété
de
ses
rapports
peut
jouer
un
rôle
dans
plusieurs
groupes
à
la
fois
ainsi
que
dans
un
certain
contexte
de
voisins
elle
serait
classée
comme
un
phénomène
physique
tandis
que
dans
un
autre
entourage
elle
figurerait
comme
un
fait
de
conscience
à
peu
près
comme
une
même
particule
peut
appartenir
simultanément
à
deux
lignes
verticale
horizontale
pourvu
soit
située
à
leur
intersection
prenons
pour
fixer
nos
idées
que
nous
avons
à
ce
moment
du
local
où
nous
sommes
de
ces
murailles
de
cette
table
de
ces
chaises
de
cet
espace
dans
cette
expérience
pleine
concrète
et
indivise
telle
est
là
donnée
le
monde
physique
objectif
et
le
monde
intérieur
et
personnel
de
chacun
de
nous
se
rencontrent
et
se
fusionnent
comme
des
lignes
se
fusionnent
à
leur
intersection
comme
chose
physique
cette
salle
a
des
rapports
avec
tout
le
reste
du
bâtiment
bâtiment
que
nous
autres
nous
ne
connaissons
et
ne
connaîtrons
pas
elle
doit
son
existence
à
toute
une
histoire
de
financiers
elle
pèse
sur
le
sol
elle
durera
indéfiniment
dans
le
temps
si
le
feu
y
éclatait
les
chaises
et
la
table
contient
seraient
vite
réduites
en
cendres
comme
expérience
personnelle
au
contraire
comme
chose
rapportée
connue
consciente
cette
salle
a
de
tout
autres
tenants
et
aboutissants
ses
antécédents
ne
sont
pas
des
ouvriers
ce
sont
nos
pensées
respectives
de
tout
à
bientôt
elle
ne
figurera
que
comme
un
fait
fugitif
dans
nos
biographies
associé
à
souvenirs
comme
expérience
psychique
elle
aucun
poids
son
ameublement
pas
combustible
elle
de
force
physique
que
sur
nos
seuls
cerveaux
et
beaucoup
nous
nient
encore
cette
influence
tandis
que
la
salle
physique
est
en
rapport
physique
avec
tout
le
reste
du
monde
et
pourtant
de
la
même
salle
absolument
dans
les
deux
cas
tant
que
nous
ne
faisons
pas
de
physique
spéculative
tant
que
nous
nous
plaçons
dans
le
sens
commun
la
salle
vue
et
sentie
qui
est
bien
la
salle
physique
de
quoi
donc
si
ce
de
de
cette
même
partie
de
la
nature
matérielle
que
tous
nos
esprits
à
ce
même
moment
embrassent
qui
entre
telle
quelle
dans
actuelle
et
intime
de
chacun
de
nous
et
que
notre
souvenir
regardera
toujours
comme
une
partie
intégrante
de
notre
histoire
absolument
une
même
étoffe
qui
figure
simultanément
selon
le
contexte
que
considère
comme
fait
matériel
et
physique
ou
comme
fait
de
conscience
intime
je
crois
donc
ne
saurait
traiter
conscience
et
matière
comme
étant
disparate
on
ni
ni
par
soustraction
en
négligeant
chaque
fois
moitié
expérience
de
composition
double
les
expériences
sont
au
contraire
primitivement
de
nature
plutôt
simple
elles
conscientes
dans
leur
entier
elles
physiques
dans
leur
entier
et
voie
que
ce
résultat
se
réalise
pour
autant
que
des
expériences
se
prolongent
dans
le
temps
entrent
dans
des
rapports
physique
se
brisant
se
chauffant
mutuellement
nous
en
faisons
un
groupe
à
part
que
nous
appelons
le
monde
physique
pour
autant
au
contraire
sont
fugitives
inertes
physiquement
que
leur
succession
ne
suit
pas
déterminé
mais
semble
plutôt
obéir
à
des
caprices
émotifs
nous
en
faisons
un
autre
groupe
que
nous
appelons
le
monde
psychique
en
entrant
à
présent
dans
un
grand
nombre
de
ces
groupes
psychiques
que
cette
salle
devient
maintenant
chose
consciente
chose
rapportée
chose
sue
en
faisant
désormais
partie
de
nos
biographies
respectives
elle
ne
sera
pas
suivie
de
cette
sotte
et
monotone
répétition
dans
le
temps
qui
caractérise
son
existence
physique
elle
sera
suivie
au
contraire
par
expériences
qui
seront
discontinues
avec
elle
ou
qui
auront
ce
genre
tout
particulier
de
continuité
que
nous
appelons
souvenir
demain
elle
aura
eu
sa
place
dans
chacun
de
nos
passés
mais
les
présents
divers
auxquels
tous
ces
passés
seront
liés
demain
seront
bien
différents
du
présent
dont
cette
salle
jouira
demain
comme
entité
physique
les
deux
genres
de
groupes
sont
formés
mais
les
rapports
des
expériences
entre
elles
diffèrent
groupe
à
donc
par
addition
phénomènes
phénomène
donné
devient
conscient
ou
connu
ce
pas
par
un
dédoublement
intérieure
la
connaissance
des
choses
leur
elle
ne
leur
est
pas
immanente
ce
le
fait
ni
moi
transcendental
ni
ou
acte
de
conscience
qui
les
animerait
chacune
se
connaissent
ou
plutôt
il
y
en
a
qui
connaissent
les
autres
et
le
rapport
que
nous
nommons
connaissance
dans
beaucoup
de
cas
suite
intermédiaires
parfaitement
susceptibles
décrites
en
termes
concrets
il
nullement
le
mystère
transcendant
où
se
sont
complus
tant
de
philosophes
mais
ceci
nous
mènerait
beaucoup
trop
loin
je
ne
puis
entrer
ici
dans
tous
les
replis
de
la
théorie
de
la
connaissance
ou
de
ce
que
vous
autres
italiens
vous
appelez
la
gnoséologie
je
dois
me
contenter
de
ces
remarques
écourtées
ou
simples
suggestions
qui
sont
je
le
crains
encore
bien
obscures
faute
des
développements
nécessaires
permettez
donc
que
je
me
résume
trop
sommairement
et
en
style
dogmatique
dans
les
six
thèses
suivantes
la
conscience
telle
ordinairement
pas
pas
plus
que
la
matière
à
laquelle
berkeley
a
donné
le
coup
de
grâce
ce
qui
existe
et
forme
la
part
de
vérité
que
le
mot
de
conscience
recouvre
la
susceptibilité
que
possèdent
les
parties
de
rapportées
ou
connues
cette
susceptibilité
par
le
fait
que
certaines
expériences
peuvent
mener
les
unes
aux
autres
par
des
expériences
intermédiaires
nettement
caractérisées
de
telle
sorte
que
les
unes
se
trouvent
jouer
le
rôle
de
choses
connues
les
autres
celui
de
sujets
connaissants
on
peut
parfaitement
définir
ces
deux
rôles
sans
sortir
de
la
trame
de
même
et
sans
invoquer
rien
de
transcendant
les
attributions
sujet
et
objet
représenté
et
représentatif
chose
et
pensée
signifient
donc
une
distinction
pratique
qui
est
de
la
dernière
importance
mais
qui
est
fonctionnel
et
nullement
ontologique
comme
le
dualisme
classique
se
la
représente
en
fin
de
compte
les
choses
et
les
pensées
ne
sont
point
foncièrement
hétérogènes
mais
elles
sont
faites
même
étoffe
étoffe
ne
peut
définir
comme
telle
mais

sense

life
of
vol
i
reason
in
common
sense
ix
is
radical
empiricism
solipsistic
if
all
the
criticisms
which
the
humanistic
is
receiving
were
as
as
mr
bode
the
truth
of
the
matter
would
more
rapidly
clear
up
not
only
is
it
excellently
well
written
but
it
brings
its
own
point
of
view
out
clearly
and
admits
of
a
perfectly
straight
reply
the
argument
unless
i
fail
to
catch
it
can
be
expressed
as
follows
if
a
series
of
experiences
be
supposed
no
one
of
which
is
endowed
immediately
with
the
function
of
reference
to
a
reality
beyond
itself
no
motive
will
occur
within
the
series
for
supposing
anything
beyond
it
to
exist
it
will
remain
subjective
and
contentedly
subjective
both
as
a
whole
and
in
its
several
parts
radical
empiricism
trying
as
it
does
to
account
for
objective
knowledge
by
means
of
such
a
series
egregiously
fails
it
can
not
explain
how
the
notion
of
a
physical
order
as
distinguished
from
a
subjectively
biographical
order
of
experiences
ever
arose
it
pretends
to
explain
the
notion
of
a
physical
order
but
does
so
by
playing
fast
and
loose
with
the
concept
of
objective
reference
on
the
one
hand
it
denies
that
such
reference
implies
on
the
part
of
any
one
experience
on
the
other
hand
it
claims
that
experiences
but
critically
considered
there
can
be
no
pointing
unless
be
also
allowed
the
conjunctive
function
of
pointing
as
i
have
assumed
it
is
according
to
my
critic
vitiated
by
the
fallacy
of
attaching
a
bilateral
relation
to
a
term
as
if
it
could
stick
out
substantively
and
maintain
itself
in
existence
in
advance
of
the
term
which
is
equally
required
for
it
to
be
a
concretely
experienced
fact
if
the
relation
be
made
concrete
the
term
is
involved
which
would
mean
if
i
succeed
in
apprehending
mr
bode
rightly
that
this
latter
term
although
not
empirically
there
is
yet
there
in
advance
in
other
words
it
would
mean
that
any
experience
that
must
already
have
transcended
itself
in
the
ordinary
sense
of
the
word
transcend
something
like
this
if
i
understand
mr
bode
text
is
the
upshot
of
his
state
of
mind
it
is
a
reasonable
sounding
state
of
mind
but
it
is
exactly
the
state
of
mind
which
radical
empiricism
by
its
doctrine
of
the
reality
of
conjunctive
relations
seeks
to
dispel
i
very
much
fear
so
difficult
does
mutual
understanding
seem
in
these
exalted
regions
that
my
able
critic
has
failed
to
understand
that
doctrine
as
it
is
meant
to
be
understood
i
suspect
that
he
performs
on
all
these
conjunctive
relations
of
which
the
aforesaid
is
only
one
the
usual
rationalistic
act
of
substitution
he
takes
them
not
as
they
are
given
in
their
first
intention
as
parts
constitutive
of
experience
living
flow
but
only
as
they
appear
in
retrospect
each
fixed
as
a
determinate
object
of
conception
static
therefore
and
contained
within
itself
against
this
rationalistic
tendency
to
treat
experience
as
chopped
up
into
discontinuous
static
objects
radical
empiricism
protests
it
insists
on
taking
conjunctions
at
their
just
as
they
come
consider
for
example
such
conjunctions
as
while
we
live
in
such
conjunctions
our
state
is
one
of
in
the
most
literal
sense
we
are
expectant
of
a
to
come
and
before
the
more
come
the
transition
nevertheless
is
directed
it
i
fail
otherwise
to
see
how
if
one
kind
of
more
comes
there
should
be
satisfaction
and
feeling
of
fulfilment
but
disappointment
if
the
more
comes
in
another
shape
one
more
will
continue
another
more
will
arrest
or
deflect
the
direction
in
which
our
experience
is
moving
even
now
we
can
not
it
is
true
our
different
living
or
except
by
naming
the
different
terms
towards
which
they
are
moving
us
but
we
their
specifications
and
differences
before
those
terms
explicitly
arrive
thus
though
the
various
are
all
bilateral
relations
each
requiring
a
term
to
define
it
when
viewed
in
retrospect
and
articulately
conceived
yet
in
its
living
moment
any
one
of
them
may
be
treated
as
if
it
out
from
its
term
and
pointed
in
a
special
direction
much
as
a
to
use
mr
bode
excellent
simile
points
at
the
pole
even
though
it
stirs
not
from
its
box
in
professor
höffding
massive
little
article
in
journal
of
philosophy
psychology
and
scientific
he
quotes
a
saying
of
kierkegaard
to
the
effect
that
we
live
forwards
but
we
understand
backwards
understanding
backwards
is
it
must
be
confessed
a
very
frequent
weakness
of
philosophers
both
of
the
rationalistic
and
of
the
ordinary
empiricist
type
radical
empiricism
alone
insists
on
understanding
forwards
also
and
refuses
to
substitute
static
concepts
of
the
understanding
for
transitions
in
our
moving
life
a
logic
similar
to
that
which
my
critic
seems
to
employ
here
should
it
seems
to
me
forbid
him
to
say
that
our
present
is
while
present
directed
towards
our
future
or
that
any
physical
movement
can
have
direction
until
its
goal
is
actually
reached
at
this
point
does
it
not
seem
as
if
the
quarrel
about
in
knowledge
might
drop
is
it
not
a
purely
verbal
dispute
call
it
or
call
it
pointing
whichever
you
like
it
makes
no
difference
so
long
as
real
transitions
towards
real
goals
are
admitted
as
things
given
experience
and
among
experience
most
indefeasible
parts
radical
empiricism
unable
to
close
its
eyes
to
the
transitions
caught
accounts
for
the
or
the
pointing
whichever
you
may
call
it
as
a
process
that
occurs
within
experience
as
an
empirically
mediated
thing
of
which
a
perfectly
definite
description
can
be
given
on
the
other
hand
denies
this
and
pretends
that
the
is
unmediated
or
if
mediated
then
mediated
in
a
world
to
justify
this
pretension
epistemology
has
first
to
transform
all
our
conjunctions
into
static
objects
and
this
i
submit
is
an
absolutely
arbitrary
act
but
in
spite
of
mr
bode
of
conjunctions
as
i
understand
them
and
as
i
understand
him
i
believe
that
at
bottom
we
are
fighting
for
nothing
different
but
are
both
defending
the
same
continuities
of
experience
in
different
forms
of
words
there
are
other
criticisms
in
the
article
in
question
but
as
this
seems
the
most
vital
one
i
will
for
the
present
at
any
rate
leave
them
untouched

refutation
of
empiricism
although
pitkin
does
not
name
me
in
his
acute
article
on
radical
empiricism
i
fear
that
some
readers
knowing
me
to
have
applied
that
name
to
my
own
doctrine
may
possibly
consider
themselves
to
have
been
in
at
my
death
in
point
of
fact
my
withers
are
entirely
unwrung
i
have
indeed
said
that
be
radical
an
empiricism
must
not
admit
into
its
constructions
any
element
that
is
not
directly
experienced
but
in
my
own
radical
empiricism
this
is
only
a
not
a
conclusion
supposed
to
flow
from
the
intrinsic
absurdity
of
transempirical
objects
i
have
never
felt
the
slightest
respect
for
the
idealistic
arguments
which
pitkin
attacks
and
of
which
ferrier
made
such
striking
use
and
i
am
perfectly
willing
to
admit
any
number
of
noumenal
beings
or
events
into
philosophy
if
only
their
pragmatic
value
can
be
shown
radical
empiricism
and
pragmatism
have
so
many
misunderstandings
to
suffer
from
that
it
seems
my
duty
not
to
let
this
one
go
any
farther
uncorrected
pitkin
to
me
perplexes
me
by
the
obscurity
of
style
which
i
find
in
almost
all
our
younger
philosophers
he
asks
me
however
two
direct
questions
which
i
understand
so
i
take
the
liberty
of
answering
first
he
asks
do
not
experience
and
science
show
countless
things
are
experienced
as
that
which
they
are
not
or
are
only
partially
i
reply
yes
assuredly
as
for
example
distorted
by
refractive
media
or
whatever
else
is
taken
to
be
more
ultimately
real
than
the
immediate
content
of
the
perceptive
moment
secondly
if
experience
is
in
intelligible
sense
does
this
fact
preclude
the
possibility
of
a
something
not
experienced
and
b
action
of
experience
upon
a
noumenon
my
reply
is
assuredly
not
the
possibility
of
either
how
could
it
yet
in
my
opinion
we
should
be
wise
not
to
any
thing
or
action
of
that
nature
and
to
restrict
our
universe
of
philosophic
discourse
to
what
is
experienced
or
at
least
experienceable

humanism
and
truth
once
more
joseph
criticism
of
my
article
and
truth
is
a
useful
contribution
to
the
general
clearing
up
he
has
seriously
tried
to
comprehend
what
the
pragmatic
movement
may
intelligibly
mean
and
if
he
has
failed
it
is
the
fault
neither
of
his
patience
nor
of
his
sincerity
but
rather
of
stubborn
tricks
of
thought
which
he
could
not
easily
get
rid
of
minute
polemics
in
which
the
parties
try
to
rebut
every
detail
of
each
of
the
other
charges
are
a
useful
exercise
only
to
the
disputants
they
can
but
breed
confusion
in
a
reader
i
will
therefore
ignore
as
much
as
possible
the
text
of
both
our
articles
mine
was
inadequate
enough
and
treat
once
more
the
general
objective
situation
as
i
apprehend
the
movement
towards
humanism
it
is
based
on
no
particular
discovery
or
principle
that
can
be
driven
into
one
precise
formula
which
thereupon
can
be
impaled
upon
a
logical
skewer
it
is
much
more
like
one
of
those
secular
changes
that
come
upon
public
opinion
as
it
were
borne
upon
tides
full
for
sound
or
foam
that
survive
all
the
crudities
and
extravagances
of
their
advocates
that
you
can
pin
to
no
one
absolutely
essential
statement
nor
kill
by
any
one
decisive
stab
such
have
been
the
changes
from
aristocracy
to
democracy
from
classic
to
romantic
taste
from
theistic
to
pantheistic
feeling
from
static
to
evolutionary
ways
of
understanding
life
changes
of
which
we
all
have
been
spectators
scholasticism
still
opposes
to
such
changes
the
method
of
confutation
by
single
decisive
reasons
showing
that
the
new
view
involves
or
traverses
some
fundamental
principle
this
is
like
stopping
a
river
by
planting
a
stick
in
the
middle
of
its
bed
round
your
obstacle
flows
the
water
and
there
all
the
same
in
reading
joseph
i
am
not
a
little
reminded
of
those
catholic
writers
who
refute
darwinism
by
telling
us
that
higher
species
can
not
come
from
lower
because
nequit
gignere
or
that
the
notion
of
transformation
is
absurd
for
it
implies
that
species
tend
to
their
own
destruction
and
that
would
violate
the
principle
that
every
reality
tends
to
persevere
in
its
own
shape
the
point
of
view
is
too
myopic
too
tight
and
close
to
take
in
the
inductive
argument
you
can
not
settle
questions
of
fact
by
formal
logic
i
feel
as
if
joseph
almost
pounced
on
my
words
singly
without
giving
the
sentences
time
to
get
out
of
my
mouth
the
one
condition
of
understanding
humanism
is
to
become
oneself
to
drop
rigorous
definitions
and
follow
lines
of
least
resistance
the
whole
in
other
words
joseph
may
probably
say
resolve
your
intellect
into
a
kind
of
slush
even
so
i
make
reply
if
you
will
consent
to
use
no
politer
word
for
humanism
conceiving
the
more
as
the
more
term
has
to
renounce
sincerely
rectilinear
arguments
and
ancient
ideals
of
rigor
and
finality
it
is
in
just
this
temper
of
renunciation
so
different
from
that
of
pyrrhonistic
scepticism
that
the
spirit
of
humanism
essentially
consists
satisfactoriness
has
to
be
measured
by
a
multitude
of
standards
of
which
some
for
aught
we
know
may
fail
in
any
given
case
and
what
is
satisfactory
than
any
alternative
in
sight
may
to
the
end
be
a
sum
of
and
concerning
which
we
can
only
trust
that
by
ulterior
corrections
and
improvements
a
maximum
of
the
one
and
a
minimum
of
the
other
may
some
day
be
approached
it
means
a
real
change
of
heart
a
break
with
absolutistic
hopes
when
one
takes
up
this
view
of
the
conditions
of
belief
that
humanism
critics
have
never
imagined
this
attitude
inwardly
is
shown
by
their
invariable
tactics
they
do
not
get
into
it
far
enough
to
see
objectively
and
from
without
what
their
own
opposite
notion
of
truth
is
joseph
is
possessed
by
some
such
notion
he
thinks
his
readers
to
be
full
of
it
he
obeys
it
works
from
it
but
never
even
essays
to
tell
us
what
it
is
the
nearest
he
comes
to
doing
so
is
where
he
says
it
is
the
way
we
ought
to
think
whether
we
be
psychologically
compelled
to
or
not
of
course
humanism
agrees
to
this
it
is
only
a
manner
of
calling
truth
an
ideal
but
humanism
explicates
the
summarizing
word
into
a
mass
of
pragmatic
motives
from
the
midst
of
which
our
critics
think
that
truth
itself
takes
flight
truth
is
a
name
of
double
meaning
it
stands
now
for
an
abstract
something
defined
only
as
that
to
which
our
thought
ought
to
conform
and
again
it
stands
for
the
concrete
propositions
within
which
we
believe
that
conformity
already
reigns
they
being
so
many
humanism
sees
that
the
only
conformity
we
ever
have
to
deal
with
concretely
is
that
between
our
subjects
and
our
predicates
using
these
words
in
a
very
broad
sense
it
sees
moreover
that
this
conformity
is
to
use
schiller
term
by
an
indefinite
number
of
pragmatic
tests
that
vary
as
the
predicates
and
subjects
vary
if
an
s
gets
superseded
by
an
sp
that
gives
our
mind
a
completer
sum
of
satisfactions
we
always
say
humanism
points
out
that
we
have
advanced
to
a
better
position
in
regard
to
truth
now
many
of
our
judgments
thus
attained
are
retrospective
the
so
the
judgment
runs
were
sp
already
ere
the
fact
was
humanly
recorded
common
sense
struck
by
this
state
of
things
now
rearranges
the
whole
field
and
traditional
philosophy
follows
her
example
the
general
requirement
that
predicates
must
conform
to
their
subject
they
translate
into
an
ontological
theory
a
most
previous
subject
of
all
is
substituted
for
the
lesser
subjects
and
conceived
of
as
an
archetypal
reality
and
the
conformity
required
of
predicates
in
detail
is
reinterpreted
as
a
relation
which
our
whole
mind
with
all
its
subjects
and
predicates
together
must
get
into
with
respect
to
this
reality
it
meanwhile
is
conceived
as
eternal
static
and
unaffected
by
our
thinking
conformity
to
a
archetype
like
this
is
probably
the
notion
of
truth
which
my
opponent
shares
with
common
sense
and
philosophic
rationalism
when
now
humanism
fully
admitting
both
the
naturalness
and
the
grandeur
of
this
hypothesis
nevertheless
points
to
its
sterility
and
declines
to
chime
in
with
the
substitution
keeping
to
the
concrete
and
still
lodging
truth
between
the
subjects
and
the
predicates
in
detail
it
provokes
the
outcry
which
we
hear
and
which
my
critic
echoes
one
of
the
commonest
parts
of
the
outcry
is
that
humanism
is
subjectivistic
altogether
it
is
supposed
to
labor
under
a
necessity
of
reality
it
is
not
hard
to
see
how
this
misconception
of
humanism
may
have
arisen
and
humanistic
writers
partly
from
not
having
sufficiently
guarded
their
expressions
and
partly
from
not
having
yet
got
round
in
the
poverty
of
their
literature
to
a
full
discussion
of
the
subject
are
doubtless
in
some
degree
to
blame
but
i
fail
to
understand
how
any
one
with
a
working
grasp
of
their
principles
can
charge
them
wholesale
with
subjectivism
i
myself
have
never
thought
of
humanism
as
being
subjectivistic
farther
than
to
this
extent
that
inasmuch
as
it
treats
the
thinker
as
being
himself
one
portion
of
reality
it
must
also
allow
that
of
the
realities
that
he
declares
for
true
are
created
by
his
being
there
such
realities
of
course
are
either
acts
of
his
or
relations
between
other
things
and
him
or
relations
between
things
which
but
for
him
would
never
have
been
traced
humanists
are
subjectivistic
also
in
this
that
unlike
rationalists
who
think
they
carry
a
warrant
for
the
absolute
truth
of
what
they
now
believe
in
in
their
present
pocket
they
hold
all
present
beliefs
as
subject
to
revision
in
the
light
of
future
experience
the
future
experience
however
may
be
of
things
outside
the
thinker
and
that
this
is
so
the
humanist
may
believe
as
freely
as
any
other
kind
of
empiricist
philosopher
the
critics
of
humanism
though
here
i
follow
them
but
darkly
appear
to
object
to
any
infusion
whatever
of
subjectivism
into
truth
all
must
be
archetypal
every
truth
must
to
its
perception
humanism
sees
that
an
enormous
quantity
of
truth
must
be
written
down
as
having
to
its
perception
by
us
humans
in
countless
instances
we
find
it
most
satisfactory
to
believe
that
though
we
were
always
ignorant
of
the
fact
it
always
a
fact
that
s
was
sp
but
humanism
separates
this
class
of
cases
from
those
in
which
it
is
more
satisfactory
to
believe
the
opposite
that
s
is
ephemeral
or
p
a
passing
event
or
sp
created
by
the
perceiving
act
our
critics
seem
on
the
other
hand
to
wish
to
universalize
the
retrospective
type
of
instance
reality
must
to
every
assertion
for
which
truth
is
claimed
and
not
content
with
this
overuse
of
one
particular
type
of
judgment
our
critics
claim
its
monopoly
they
appear
to
wish
to
cut
off
humanism
from
its
rights
to
any
retrospection
at
all
humanism
says
that
satisfactoriness
is
what
distinguishes
the
true
from
the
false
but
satisfactoriness
is
both
a
subjective
quality
and
a
present
one
the
critics
appear
to
reason
an
object
true
must
always
for
humanism
be
both
present
and
subjective
and
a
humanist
belief
can
never
be
in
anything
that
lives
outside
of
the
belief
itself
or
it
why
so
preposterous
a
charge
should
be
so
current
i
find
it
hard
to
say
nothing
is
more
obvious
than
the
fact
that
both
the
objective
and
the
past
existence
of
the
object
may
be
the
very
things
about
it
that
most
seem
satisfactory
and
that
most
invite
us
to
believe
them
the
past
tense
can
figure
in
the
humanist
world
as
well
of
belief
as
of
representation
quite
as
harmoniously
as
in
the
world
of
any
one
else
joseph
gives
a
special
turn
to
this
accusation
he
charges
me
with
being
when
i
say
that
the
main
categories
of
thought
were
evolved
in
the
course
of
experience
itself
for
i
use
these
very
categories
to
define
the
course
of
experience
by
experience
as
i
talk
about
it
is
a
product
of
their
use
and
yet
i
take
it
as
true
anteriorly
to
them
this
seems
to
joseph
to
be
an
absurdity
i
hope
it
does
not
seem
such
to
his
readers
for
if
experiences
can
suggest
hypotheses
at
all
and
they
notoriously
do
so
i
can
see
no
absurdity
whatever
in
the
notion
of
a
retrospective
hypothesis
having
for
its
object
the
very
train
of
experiences
by
which
its
own
being
along
with
that
of
other
things
has
been
brought
about
if
the
hypothesis
is
we
must
of
course
believe
it
to
have
been
true
anteriorly
to
its
formulation
by
ourselves
every
explanation
of
a
present
by
a
past
seems
to
involve
this
kind
of
circle
which
is
not
a
vicious
circle
the
past
is
of
the
present
which
in
turn
is
of
the
past
if
the
present
were
treated
as
of
the
past
the
circle
might
indeed
be
vicious
closely
connected
with
this
is
another
one
of
wider
scope
and
greater
complication
more
excusable
therefore
humanism
namely
asking
how
truth
in
point
of
fact
is
reached
and
seeing
that
it
is
by
ever
substituting
more
satisfactory
for
less
satisfactory
opinions
is
thereby
led
into
a
vague
historic
sketch
of
truth
development
the
earliest
it
thinks
must
have
been
dim
unconnected
and
only
little
by
little
did
more
and
more
orderly
views
of
things
replace
them
our
own
retrospective
view
of
this
whole
evolution
is
now
let
us
say
the
latest
candidate
for
as
yet
reached
in
the
process
to
be
a
satisfactory
candidate
it
must
give
some
definite
sort
of
a
picture
of
what
forces
keep
the
process
going
on
the
subjective
side
we
have
a
fairly
definite
picture
sensation
association
interest
hypothesis
these
account
in
a
general
way
for
the
growth
into
a
cosmos
of
the
relative
chaos
with
which
the
mind
began
but
on
the
side
of
the
object
so
to
call
it
roughly
our
view
is
much
less
satisfactory
of
which
of
our
many
objects
are
we
to
believe
that
it
truly
there
and
at
work
before
the
human
mind
began
time
space
kind
number
serial
order
cause
consciousness
are
hard
things
not
to
objectify
even
transcendental
idealism
leaves
them
standing
as
real
substance
matter
force
fall
down
more
easily
before
criticism
and
secondary
qualities
make
almost
no
resistance
at
all
nevertheless
when
we
survey
the
field
of
speculation
from
scholasticism
through
kantism
to
spencerism
we
find
an
tendency
to
convert
the
into
a
merely
logical
object
an
unknowable
that
but
starts
the
process
or
a
vague
that
but
receives
our
forms
the
reasons
for
this
are
not
so
much
logical
as
they
are
material
we
can
postulate
an
freely
enough
though
some
idealists
have
denied
us
the
privilege
but
when
we
have
done
so
the
of
it
is
hard
to
determine
satisfactorily
because
of
the
oppositions
and
entanglements
of
the
variously
proposed
with
one
another
and
with
the
history
of
the
human
mind
the
literature
of
speculative
cosmology
bears
witness
to
this
difficulty
humanism
suffers
from
it
no
more
than
any
other
philosophy
suffers
but
it
makes
all
our
cosmogonic
theories
so
unsatisfactory
that
some
thinkers
seek
relief
in
the
denial
of
any
primal
dualism
absolute
thought
or
is
postulated
and
endowed
with
attributes
calculated
to
justify
the
belief
that
it
may
itself
both
these
hypotheses
are
in
the
old
sense
but
the
one
is
monistic
and
the
other
pluralistic
as
to
the
world
process
itself
some
humanists
are
of
this
sort
i
myself
am
one
of
the
pluralistic
brand
but
doubtless
dualistic
humanists
also
exist
as
well
as
ones
of
the
monistic
wing
joseph
pins
these
general
philosophic
difficulties
on
humanism
alone
or
possibly
on
me
alone
my
article
spoke
vaguely
of
a
chaotic
pure
experience
coming
first
and
building
up
the
mind
but
how
can
two
structureless
things
interact
so
as
to
produce
a
structure
my
critic
triumphantly
asks
of
course
they
ca
as
purely
entities
we
must
make
additional
hypotheses
we
must
beg
a
minimum
of
structure
for
them
the
of
minimum
that
have
tended
to
increase
towards
what
we
now
find
actually
developed
is
the
philosophical
desideratum
here
the
question
is
that
of
the
most
materially
satisfactory
hypothesis
joseph
handles
it
by
formal
logic
purely
as
if
he
had
no
acquaintance
with
the
logic
of
hypothesis
at
all
joseph
again
is
much
bewildered
as
to
what
a
humanist
can
mean
when
he
uses
the
word
knowledge
he
tries
to
convict
me
of
vaguely
identifying
it
with
any
kind
of
good
knowledge
is
a
difficult
thing
to
define
briefly
and
joseph
shows
his
own
constructive
hand
here
even
less
than
in
the
rest
of
his
article
i
have
myself
put
forth
on
several
occasions
a
radically
pragmatist
account
of
knowledge
the
existence
of
which
account
my
critic
probably
does
not
know
of
so
perhaps
i
had
better
not
say
anything
about
knowledge
until
he
reads
and
attacks
that
i
will
say
however
that
whatever
the
relation
called
knowing
may
itself
prove
to
consist
in
i
can
think
of
no
conceivable
kind
of
which
may
not
become
an
object
of
knowledge
on
humanistic
principles
as
well
as
on
the
principles
of
any
other
philosophy
i
confess
that
i
am
pretty
steadily
hampered
by
the
habit
on
the
part
of
humanism
critics
of
assuming
that
they
have
truer
ideas
than
mine
of
truth
and
knowledge
the
nature
of
which
i
must
know
of
and
can
not
need
to
have
i
have
consequently
to
reconstruct
these
ideas
in
order
to
carry
on
the
discussion
i
have
had
to
do
so
in
some
parts
of
this
article
and
i
thereby
expose
myself
to
charges
of
caricature
in
one
part
of
joseph
attack
however
i
rejoice
that
we
are
free
from
this
embarrassment
it
is
an
important
point
and
covers
probably
a
genuine
difficulty
so
i
take
it
up
last
when
following
schiller
and
dewey
i
define
the
true
as
that
which
gives
the
maximal
combination
of
satisfactions
and
say
that
satisfaction
is
a
term
that
can
be
realized
in
various
ways
joseph
replies
rightly
enough
that
the
chief
satisfaction
of
a
rational
creature
must
always
be
his
thought
that
what
he
believes
is
whether
the
truth
brings
him
the
satisfaction
of
collateral
profits
or
not
this
would
seem
however
to
make
of
truth
the
prior
concept
and
to
relegate
satisfaction
to
a
secondary
place
again
if
to
be
satisfactory
is
what
is
meant
by
being
true
satisfactions
and
of
his
satisfactions
are
to
count
discriminations
notoriously
have
to
be
made
and
the
upshot
is
that
only
rational
candidates
and
intellectual
satisfactions
stand
the
test
we
are
then
driven
to
a
purely
theoretic
notion
of
truth
and
get
out
of
the
pragmatic
atmosphere
altogether
and
with
this
joseph
leaves
us
truth
is
truth
and
there
is
an
end
of
the
matter
but
he
makes
a
very
pretty
show
of
convicting
me
of
in
according
to
our
purely
theoretic
satisfactions
any
place
in
the
humanistic
scheme
they
crowd
the
collateral
satisfactions
out
of
house
and
home
he
thinks
and
pragmatism
has
to
go
into
bankruptcy
if
she
recognizes
them
at
all
there
is
no
room
for
disagreement
about
the
facts
here
but
the
destructive
force
of
the
reasoning
disappears
as
soon
as
we
talk
concretely
instead
of
abstractly
and
ask
in
our
quality
of
good
pragmatists
just
what
the
famous
theoretic
needs
are
known
as
and
in
what
the
intellectual
satisfactions
consist
joseph
faithful
to
the
habits
of
his
party
makes
no
attempt
at
characterizing
them
but
assumes
that
their
nature
is
to
all
are
they
not
all
mere
matters
of
and
emphatically
of
consistency
between
an
absolute
reality
and
the
mind
copies
of
it
but
of
actually
felt
consistency
among
judgments
objects
and
manners
of
reacting
in
the
mind
and
are
not
both
our
need
of
such
consistency
and
our
pleasure
in
it
conceivable
as
outcomes
of
the
natural
fact
that
we
are
beings
that
develop
mental
habit
itself
proving
adaptively
beneficial
in
an
environment
where
the
same
objects
or
the
same
kinds
of
objects
recur
and
follow
if
this
were
so
what
would
have
come
first
would
have
been
the
collateral
profits
of
habit
and
the
theoretic
life
would
have
grown
up
in
aid
of
these
in
point
of
fact
this
seems
to
have
been
the
probable
case
at
life
origin
any
present
perception
may
have
been
if
such
a
word
could
then
be
applicable
later
when
reactions
became
organized
the
reactions
became
whenever
expectation
was
fulfilled
by
them
otherwise
they
were
or
reactions
but
the
same
class
of
objects
needs
the
same
kind
of
reaction
so
the
impulse
to
react
consistently
must
gradually
have
been
established
with
a
disappointment
felt
whenever
the
results
frustrated
expectation
here
is
a
perfectly
plausible
germ
for
all
our
higher
consistencies
nowadays
if
an
object
claims
from
us
a
reaction
of
the
kind
habitually
accorded
only
to
the
opposite
class
of
objects
our
mental
machinery
refuses
to
run
smoothly
the
situation
is
intellectually
unsatisfactory
to
gain
relief
we
seek
either
to
preserve
the
reaction
by
the
object
or
leaving
the
object
as
it
is
we
react
in
a
way
contrary
to
the
way
claimed
of
us
neither
solution
is
easy
such
a
situation
might
be
that
of
joseph
with
me
claiming
assent
to
humanism
from
him
he
can
not
apperceive
it
so
as
to
permit
him
to
gratify
my
claim
but
there
is
enough
appeal
in
the
claim
to
induce
him
to
write
a
whole
article
in
justification
of
his
refusal
if
he
should
assent
to
humanism
on
the
other
hand
that
would
drag
after
it
an
unwelcome
yea
incredible
alteration
of
his
previous
mental
beliefs
whichever
alternative
he
might
adopt
however
a
new
equilibrium
of
intellectual
consistency
would
in
the
end
be
reached
he
would
feel
whichever
way
he
decided
that
he
was
now
thinking
truly
but
if
with
his
old
habits
unaltered
he
should
simply
add
to
them
the
new
one
of
advocating
humanism
quietly
or
noisily
his
mind
would
be
rent
into
two
systems
each
of
which
would
accuse
the
other
of
falsehood
the
resultant
situation
being
profoundly
unsatisfactory
would
also
be
instable
theoretic
truth
is
thus
no
relation
between
our
mind
and
archetypal
reality
it
falls
the
mind
being
the
accord
of
some
of
its
processes
and
objects
with
other
processes
and
objects
consisting
here
in
relations
so
long
as
the
satisfaction
of
feeling
such
an
accord
is
denied
us
whatever
collateral
profits
may
seem
to
inure
from
what
we
believe
in
are
but
as
dust
in
the
balance
provided
always
that
we
are
highly
organized
intellectually
which
the
majority
of
us
are
not
the
amount
of
accord
which
satisfies
most
men
and
women
is
merely
the
absence
of
violent
clash
between
their
usual
thoughts
and
statements
and
the
limited
sphere
of
in
which
their
lives
are
cast
the
theoretic
truth
that
most
of
us
think
we
to
attain
to
is
thus
the
possession
of
a
set
of
predicates
that
do
not
contradict
their
subjects
we
preserve
it
as
often
as
not
by
leaving
other
predicates
and
subjects
out
in
some
men
theory
is
a
passion
just
as
music
is
in
others
the
form
of
inner
consistency
is
pursued
far
beyond
the
line
at
which
collateral
profits
stop
such
men
systematize
and
classify
and
schematize
and
make
synoptical
tables
and
invent
ideal
objects
for
the
pure
love
of
unifying
too
often
the
results
glowing
with
for
the
inventors
seem
pathetically
personal
and
artificial
to
bystanders
which
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
the
purely
theoretic
criterion
of
truth
can
leave
us
in
the
lurch
as
easily
as
any
other
criterion
i
think
that
if
joseph
will
but
consider
all
these
things
a
little
more
concretely
he
may
find
that
the
humanistic
scheme
and
the
notion
of
theoretic
truth
fall
into
line
consistently
enough
to
yield
him
also
intellectual
satisfaction

absolutism
and
empiricism
no
seeker
of
truth
can
fail
to
rejoice
at
the
sort
of
discussion
of
the
issues
between
empiricism
and
transcendentalism
or
as
the
champions
of
the
latter
would
probably
prefer
to
say
between
irrationalism
and
rationalism
that
seems
to
have
begun
in
it
would
seem
as
if
over
concrete
examples
like
haldane
both
parties
ought
inevitably
to
come
to
a
better
understanding
as
a
reader
with
a
strong
bias
towards
irrationalism
i
have
studied
his
article
with
the
liveliest
admiration
of
its
temper
and
its
painstaking
effort
to
be
clear
but
the
cases
discussed
failed
to
satisfy
me
and
i
was
at
first
tempted
to
write
a
note
animadverting
upon
them
in
detail
the
growth
of
the
limb
the
sea
contour
the
vicarious
functioning
of
the
the
digitalis
curing
the
heart
are
unfortunately
cases
where
we
can
any
conditioning
of
the
parts
by
the
whole
they
are
all
cases
of
reciprocity
where
subjects
supposed
independently
to
exist
acquire
certain
attributes
through
their
relations
to
other
subjects
that
they
also
through
similar
relations
is
only
an
ideal
supposition
not
verified
to
our
understanding
in
these
or
any
other
concrete
cases
whatsoever
if
however
one
were
to
urge
this
solemnly
haldane
friends
could
easily
reply
that
he
only
gave
us
such
examples
on
account
of
the
hardness
of
our
hearts
he
knew
full
well
their
imperfection
but
he
hoped
that
to
those
who
would
not
spontaneously
ascend
to
the
notion
of
the
totality
these
cases
might
prove
a
spur
and
suggest
and
symbolize
something
better
than
themselves
no
particular
case
that
can
be
brought
forward
is
a
real
concrete
they
are
all
abstractions
from
the
whole
and
of
course
the
character
can
not
be
found
in
them
each
of
them
still
contains
among
its
elements
what
we
call
grammatical
subjects
forming
a
sort
of
residual
of
existence
after
all
the
relations
that
figure
in
the
examples
have
been
told
off
on
this
existence
thinks
popular
philosophy
things
may
live
on
like
the
winter
bears
on
their
own
fat
never
entering
relations
at
all
or
if
entering
them
entering
an
entirely
different
set
of
them
from
those
treated
of
in
examples
thus
the
digitalis
were
to
weaken
instead
of
strengthening
the
heart
and
to
produce
death
as
sometimes
happens
it
would
determine
itself
through
determining
the
organism
to
the
function
of
kill
instead
of
that
of
cure
the
function
and
relation
seem
adventitious
depending
on
what
kind
of
a
heart
the
digitalis
gets
hold
of
the
digitalis
and
the
heart
being
facts
external
and
so
to
speak
accidental
to
each
other
but
this
popular
view
friends
will
continue
is
an
illusion
what
seems
to
us
the
existence
of
digitalis
and
heart
outside
of
the
relations
of
killing
or
curing
is
but
a
function
in
a
wider
system
of
relations
of
which
hac
we
take
no
account
the
larger
system
determines
the
just
as
absolutely
as
the
system
kill
or
the
system
cure
determined
the
of
the
digitalis
ascend
to
the
absolute
system
instead
of
biding
with
these
relative
and
partial
ones
and
you
shall
see
that
the
law
of
must
and
does
obtain
of
course
this
argument
is
entirely
reasonable
and
debars
us
completely
from
chopping
logic
about
the
concrete
examples
haldane
has
chosen
it
is
not
his
fault
if
his
categories
are
so
fine
an
instrument
that
nothing
but
the
sum
total
of
things
can
be
taken
to
show
us
the
manner
of
their
use
it
is
simply
our
misfortune
that
he
has
not
the
sum
total
of
things
to
show
it
by
let
us
fall
back
from
all
concrete
attempts
and
see
what
we
can
do
with
his
notion
of
avowedly
taken
in
abstract
systems
the
ideal
is
realized
on
every
hand
in
any
system
as
such
the
members
are
only
in
the
system
abolish
the
system
and
you
abolish
its
members
for
you
have
conceived
them
through
no
other
property
than
the
abstract
one
of
membership
neither
rightness
nor
leftness
except
through
neither
mortgager
nor
mortgagee
except
through
mortgage
the
logic
of
these
cases
is
this
a
then
b
but
b
then
a
wherefore
either
both
and
if
not
both
nothing
it
costs
nothing
not
even
a
mental
effort
to
admit
that
the
absolute
totality
of
things
be
organized
exactly
after
the
pattern
of
one
of
these
abstractions
in
fact
it
is
the
pleasantest
and
freest
of
mental
movements
husband
makes
and
is
made
by
wife
through
marriage
one
makes
other
by
being
itself
other
everything
through
its
opposite
you
go
round
like
a
squirrel
in
a
cage
but
if
you
stop
and
reflect
upon
what
you
are
about
you
lay
bare
the
exact
point
at
issue
between
common
sense
and
the
school
what
in
fact
is
the
logic
of
these
abstract
systems
it
is
as
we
said
above
if
any
member
then
the
whole
system
if
not
the
whole
system
then
nothing
but
how
can
logic
possibly
do
anything
more
with
these
two
hypotheses
than
combine
them
into
the
single
disjunctive
proposition
either
this
whole
system
just
as
it
stands
or
nothing
at
all
is
not
that
disjunction
the
ultimate
word
of
logic
in
the
matter
and
can
any
disjunction
as
such
resolve
it
may
be
that
haldane
sees
how
one
horn
the
concept
of
the
whole
system
carries
real
existence
with
it
but
if
he
has
been
as
unsuccessful
as
i
in
assimilating
the
hegelian
of
the
anselmian
proof
he
will
have
to
say
that
though
logic
may
determine
the
system
must
be
it
is
something
else
than
logic
must
tell
us
it
is
haldane
in
this
case
would
probably
consciously
or
unconsciously
make
an
appeal
to
fact
the
disjunction
decided
since
nobody
can
dispute
that
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
and
not
nothing
we
must
he
would
probably
say
go
on
to
admit
the
whole
system
in
the
desiderated
sense
is
not
then
the
validity
of
the
anselmian
proof
the
nucleus
of
the
whole
question
between
logic
and
fact
ought
not
the
efforts
of
haldane
and
his
friends
to
be
principally
devoted
to
its
elucidation
is
it
not
the
real
door
of
separation
between
empiricism
and
rationalism
and
if
the
rationalists
leave
that
door
for
a
moment
off
its
hinges
can
any
power
keep
that
abstract
opaque
unmediated
external
irrational
and
irresponsible
monster
known
to
the
vulgar
as
bare
fact
from
getting
in
and
contaminating
the
whole
sanctuary
with
his
presence
can
anything
prevent
faust
from
changing
am
anfang
war
das
wort
into
am
anfang
war
die
that
nothing
in
earth
or
heaven
only
the
anselmian
proof
can
keep
fact
out
of
philosophy
the
question
shall
fact
be
recognized
as
an
ultimate
principle
is
the
whole
issue
between
the
rationalists
and
the
empiricism
of
vulgar
thought
of
course
if
so
recognized
fact
sets
a
limit
to
the
character
of
the
world
rationality
that
rationality
might
then
mediate
between
all
the
members
of
our
conception
of
the
world
but
not
between
the
conception
itself
and
reality
reality
would
have
to
be
given
not
by
reason
but
by
fact
fact
holds
out
blankly
brutally
and
blindly
against
that
universal
deliquescence
of
everything
into
logical
relations
which
the
absolutist
logic
demands
and
it
is
the
only
thing
that
does
hold
out
hence
the
ire
of
the
absolutist
logic
hence
its
its
of
fact
the
reasons
it
gives
for
the
are
that
fact
is
speechless
a
mere
word
for
the
negation
of
thought
a
vacuous
unknowability
a
in
truth
which
having
no
rights
of
its
own
can
find
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
keep
its
betters
out
of
theirs
there
are
two
points
involved
here
first
the
claim
that
certain
things
have
rights
that
are
absolute
ubiquitous
and
all
pervasive
and
in
regard
to
which
nothing
else
can
possibly
exist
in
its
right
and
second
that
anything
that
denies
assertion
is
negativity
with
no
positive
context
whatsoever
take
the
latter
point
first
is
it
true
that
what
is
negative
in
one
way
is
thereby
convicted
of
incapacity
to
be
positive
in
any
other
way
the
word
fact
is
like
the
word
accident
like
the
word
absolute
itself
they
all
have
their
negative
connotation
in
truth
their
whole
connotation
is
negative
and
relative
all
it
says
is
that
whatever
the
thing
may
be
that
is
denoted
by
the
words
things
do
not
control
it
where
fact
where
accident
is
they
must
be
silent
it
alone
can
speak
but
that
does
not
prevent
its
speaking
as
loudly
as
you
please
in
its
own
tongue
it
may
have
an
inward
life
and
active
in
the
maximum
degree
an
indeterminate
future
volition
on
my
part
for
example
would
be
a
strict
accident
as
far
as
my
present
self
is
concerned
but
that
could
not
prevent
it
the
moment
in
which
it
from
being
possibly
the
most
intensely
living
and
luminous
experience
i
ever
had
its
quality
of
being
a
brute
fact
says
nothing
whatever
as
to
its
inwardness
it
simply
says
to
off
and
this
brings
us
back
to
the
first
point
of
the
absolutist
indictment
of
fact
is
that
point
really
anything
more
than
a
fantastic
dislike
to
letting
say
off
what
else
explains
the
contempt
the
absolutist
authors
exhibit
for
a
freedom
defined
simply
on
its
negative
side
as
freedom
from
what
else
prompts
them
to
deride
such
freedom
but
dislike
for
dislike
who
shall
decide
why
is
not
their
dislike
at
having
me
from
them
entirely
on
a
par
with
mine
at
having
them
through
me
i
know
very
well
that
in
talking
of
dislikes
to
those
who
never
mention
them
i
am
doing
a
very
coarse
thing
and
making
a
sort
of
intellectual
orson
of
myself
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
can
not
help
it
because
i
feel
sure
that
likes
and
dislikes
be
among
the
ultimate
factors
of
their
philosophy
as
well
as
of
mine
would
they
but
admit
it
how
sweetly
we
then
could
hold
converse
together
there
is
something
finite
about
us
both
as
we
now
stand
we
do
not
know
the
absolute
whole
of
it
is
still
negative
to
us
among
the
of
it
still
stalks
a
mob
of
opaque
without
which
we
can
not
think
but
just
as
i
admit
that
this
is
all
possibly
provisional
that
even
the
anselmian
proof
may
come
out
all
right
and
creation
be
a
rational
system
why
might
they
not
also
admit
that
it
may
all
be
otherwise
and
that
the
shadow
the
opacity
the
negativity
the
from
the
plurality
that
is
ultimate
never
be
wholly
driven
from
the
scene
we
should
both
then
be
avowedly
making
hypotheses
playing
with
ideals
ah
why
is
the
notion
of
hypothesis
so
abhorrent
to
the
hegelian
mind
and
once
down
on
our
common
level
of
hypothesis
we
might
then
admit
scepticism
since
the
whole
is
not
yet
revealed
to
be
the
soundest
position
but
since
we
are
in
the
main
not
sceptics
we
might
go
on
and
frankly
confess
to
each
other
the
motives
for
our
several
faiths
i
frankly
confess
mine
i
can
not
but
think
that
at
bottom
they
are
of
an
æsthetic
and
not
of
a
logical
sort
the
universe
seems
to
suffocate
me
with
its
infallible
impeccable
its
necessity
with
no
possibilities
its
relations
with
no
subjects
make
me
feel
as
if
i
had
entered
into
a
contract
with
no
reserved
rights
or
rather
as
if
i
had
to
live
in
a
large
seaside
with
no
private
in
which
i
might
take
refuge
from
the
society
of
the
place
i
am
distinctly
aware
moreover
that
the
old
quarrel
of
sinner
and
pharisee
has
something
to
do
with
the
matter
certainly
to
my
personal
knowledge
all
hegelians
are
not
prigs
but
i
somehow
feel
as
if
all
prigs
ought
to
end
if
developed
by
becoming
hegelians
there
is
a
story
of
two
clergymen
asked
by
mistake
to
conduct
the
same
funeral
one
came
first
and
had
got
no
farther
than
i
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
when
the
other
entered
am
the
resurrection
and
the
life
cried
the
latter
the
philosophy
as
it
actually
exists
reminds
many
of
us
of
that
clergyman
it
seems
too
and
and
a
thing
to
speak
for
the
vast
unconscious
kosmos
with
its
dread
abysses
and
its
unknown
tides
the
freedom
want
to
see
there
is
not
the
freedom
with
a
string
tied
to
its
leg
and
warranted
not
to
fly
away
of
that
philosophy
let
it
fly
away
we
say
from
what
then
again
i
know
i
am
exhibiting
my
mental
grossness
but
again
kann
nicht
i
show
my
feelings
why
they
not
show
theirs
i
know
they
a
personal
feeling
about
the
universe
which
is
entirely
different
from
mine
and
which
i
should
very
likely
be
much
the
better
for
gaining
if
they
would
only
show
me
how
their
persistence
in
telling
me
that
feeling
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
question
that
it
is
a
pure
matter
of
absolute
reason
keeps
me
for
ever
out
of
the
pale
still
seeing
a
in
things
which
logic
does
not
expel
the
most
i
can
do
is
to
to
the
expulsion
at
present
i
do
not
even
aspire
aspiration
is
a
feeling
what
can
kindle
feeling
but
the
example
of
feeling
and
if
the
hegelians
refuse
to
set
an
example
what
can
they
expect
the
rest
of
us
to
do
to
speak
more
seriously
the
one
quarrel
empiricism
has
with
absolutism
is
over
this
repudiation
by
absolutism
of
the
personal
and
æsthetic
factor
in
the
construction
of
philosophy
that
we
all
of
us
have
feelings
empiricism
feels
quite
sure
that
they
may
be
as
prophetic
and
anticipatory
of
truth
as
anything
else
we
have
and
some
of
them
more
so
than
others
can
not
possibly
be
denied
but
what
hope
is
there
of
squaring
and
settling
opinions
unless
absolutism
will
hold
parley
on
this
common
ground
and
will
admit
that
all
philosophies
are
hypotheses
to
which
all
our
faculties
emotional
as
well
as
logical
help
us
and
the
truest
of
which
will
at
the
final
integration
of
things
be
found
in
possession
of
the
men
whose
faculties
on
the
whole
had
the
best
divining
power
