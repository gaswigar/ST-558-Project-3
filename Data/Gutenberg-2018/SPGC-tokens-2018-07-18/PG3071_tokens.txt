for

strange

i
the

she
s
here
i
thought
she
would
be
she
s
one
of
the
three
young
ladies
you
see
in
the
box
near
the
the
gentleman
thus
addressed
a
man
of
middle
age
and
a
member
of
the
most
exclusive
clubs
turned
his
opera
glass
toward
the
spot
designated
and
in
some
astonishment
retorted
she
why
those
are
the
misses
pratt
and
miss
violet
strange
no
and
do
you
mean
to
say
i
do
that
yon
silly
little
chit
whose
father
i
know
whose
fortune
i
know
who
is
seen
everywhere
and
who
is
called
one
of
the
season
s
belles
is
an
agent
of
yours
a
a
no
names
here
please
you
want
a
mystery
solved
it
is
not
a
matter
for
the
police
that
is
as
yet
and
so
you
come
to
me
and
when
i
ask
for
the
facts
i
find
that
women
and
only
women
are
involved
and
that
these
women
are
not
only
young
but
one
and
all
of
the
highest
society
is
it
a
man
s
work
to
go
to
the
bottom
of
a
combination
like
this
no
sex
against
sex
and
if
possible
youth
against
youth
happily
i
know
such
a
person
a
girl
of
gifts
and
extraordinarily
well
placed
for
the
purpose
why
she
uses
her
talents
in
this
direction
why
with
means
enough
to
play
the
part
natural
to
her
as
a
successful
debutante
she
consents
to
occupy
herself
with
social
and
other
mysteries
you
must
ask
her
not
me
enough
that
i
promise
you
her
aid
if
you
want
it
that
is
if
you
can
interest
her
she
will
not
work
driscoll
again
raised
his
opera
glass
but
it
s
a
comedy
face
he
commented
it
s
hard
to
associate
intellectuality
with
such
quaintness
of
expression
are
you
sure
of
her
discretion
whom
is
she
with
abner
pratt
his
wife
and
is
he
a
man
to
entrust
his
affairs
unadvisedly
abner
pratt
do
you
mean
to
say
that
she
is
anything
more
to
him
than
his
daughters
guest
judge
you
see
how
merry
they
are
they
were
in
deep
trouble
yesterday
you
are
witness
to
a
and
she
don
t
you
observe
how
they
are
loading
her
with
attentions
she
s
too
young
to
rouse
such
interest
in
a
family
of
notably
unsympathetic
temperament
for
any
other
reason
than
that
of
it
s
hard
to
believe
but
if
what
you
hint
is
true
secure
me
an
opportunity
at
once
of
talking
to
this
youthful
marvel
my
affair
is
serious
the
dinner
i
have
mentioned
comes
off
in
three
days
and
i
know
i
recognize
your
need
but
i
think
you
had
better
enter
pratt
s
box
without
my
intervention
miss
strange
s
value
to
us
will
be
impaired
the
moment
her
connection
with
us
is
ah
there
s
ruthven
he
will
take
me
to
pratt
s
box
remarked
driscoll
as
the
curtain
fell
on
the
second
act
any
suggestions
before
i
go
yes
and
an
important
one
when
you
make
your
bow
touch
your
left
shoulder
with
your
right
hand
it
is
a
signal
she
may
respond
to
it
but
if
she
does
not
do
not
be
discouraged
one
of
her
idiosyncrasies
is
a
theoretical
dislike
of
her
work
but
once
she
gets
interested
nothing
will
hold
her
back
that
s
all
except
this
in
no
event
give
away
her
secret
that
s
part
of
the
compact
you
driscoll
nodded
and
left
his
seat
for
ruthven
s
box
when
the
curtain
rose
for
the
third
time
he
could
be
seen
sitting
with
the
misses
pratt
and
their
vivacious
young
friend
a
widower
and
still
on
the
right
side
of
fifty
his
presence
there
did
not
pass
unnoted
and
curiosity
was
rife
among
certain
onlookers
as
to
which
of
the
twin
belles
was
responsible
for
this
change
in
his
habits
unfortunately
no
opportunity
was
given
him
for
showing
other
and
younger
men
had
followed
his
lead
into
the
box
and
they
saw
him
forced
upon
the
good
graces
of
the
fascinating
but
inconsequent
miss
strange
whose
rapid
fire
of
talk
he
was
hardly
of
a
temperament
to
appreciate
did
he
appear
dissatisfied
yes
but
only
one
person
in
the
opera
house
knew
why
miss
strange
had
shown
no
comprehension
of
or
sympathy
with
his
errand
though
she
chatted
amiably
enough
between
duets
and
trios
she
gave
him
no
opportunity
to
express
his
wishes
though
she
knew
them
well
enough
owing
to
the
signal
he
had
given
her
this
might
be
in
character
but
it
hardly
suited
his
views
and
being
a
man
of
resolution
he
took
advantage
of
an
absorbing
minute
on
the
stage
to
lean
forward
and
whisper
in
her
ear
it
s
my
daughter
for
whom
i
request
your
services
as
fine
a
girl
as
any
in
this
house
give
me
a
hearing
you
certainly
can
manage
she
was
a
small
slight
woman
whose
naturally
quaint
appearance
was
accentuated
by
the
extreme
simplicity
of
her
attire
in
the
tier
upon
tier
of
boxes
rising
before
his
eyes
no
other
personality
could
vie
with
hers
in
strangeness
or
in
the
illusive
quality
of
her
expression
she
was
vivacity
incarnate
and
to
the
ordinary
observer
light
as
thistledown
in
fibre
and
in
feeling
but
not
to
all
to
those
who
watched
her
long
there
came
moments
say
when
the
music
rose
to
heights
of
greatness
when
the
mouth
so
given
over
to
laughter
took
on
curves
of
the
rarest
sensibility
and
a
woman
s
lofty
soul
shone
through
her
odd
bewildering
features
driscoll
had
noted
this
and
consequently
awaited
her
reply
in
secret
hope
it
came
in
the
form
of
a
question
and
only
after
an
instant
s
display
of
displeasure
or
possibly
of
pure
nervous
irritability
what
has
she
done
nothing
but
slander
is
in
the
air
and
any
day
it
may
ripen
into
public
accusation
of
what
her
tone
was
almost
pettish
of
of
theft
he
murmured
on
a
great
scale
he
emphasized
as
the
music
rose
to
a
crash
jewels
inestimable
ones
they
are
always
returned
by
somebody
people
say
by
ah
the
little
lady
s
hands
grew
steady
they
had
been
fluttering
all
over
her
lap
i
will
see
you
morning
at
my
father
s
house
she
presently
observed
and
turned
her
full
attention
to
the
stage
some
three
days
after
this
driscoll
opened
his
house
on
the
hudson
to
notable
guests
he
had
not
desired
the
publicity
of
such
an
event
nor
the
opportunity
it
gave
for
an
increase
of
the
scandal
secretly
in
circulation
against
his
daughter
but
the
ambassador
and
his
wife
were
foreign
and
any
evasion
of
the
promised
hospitality
would
be
sure
to
be
misunderstood
so
the
scheme
was
carried
forward
though
with
less
eclat
than
possibly
was
expected
among
the
lesser
guests
who
were
mostly
young
and
well
acquainted
with
the
house
and
its
hospitality
there
was
one
unique
figure
that
of
the
lively
miss
strange
who
if
personally
unknown
to
miss
driscoll
was
so
gifted
with
the
qualities
which
tell
on
an
occasion
of
this
kind
that
the
stately
young
hostess
hailed
her
presence
with
very
obvious
gratitude
the
manner
of
their
first
meeting
was
singular
and
of
great
interest
to
one
of
them
at
least
miss
strange
had
come
in
an
automobile
and
had
been
shown
her
room
but
there
was
nobody
to
accompany
her
afterward
and
finding
herself
alone
in
the
great
hall
she
naturally
moved
toward
the
library
the
door
of
which
stood
ajar
she
had
pushed
this
door
half
open
before
she
noticed
that
the
room
was
already
occupied
as
a
consequence
she
was
made
the
unexpected
observer
of
a
beautiful
picture
of
youth
and
love
a
young
man
and
a
young
woman
were
standing
together
in
the
glow
of
a
blazing
no
word
was
to
be
heard
but
in
their
faces
eloquent
with
passion
there
shone
something
so
deep
and
true
that
the
chance
intruder
hesitated
on
the
threshold
eager
to
lay
this
picture
away
in
her
mind
with
the
other
lovely
and
tragic
memories
now
fast
accumulating
there
then
she
drew
back
and
readvancing
with
a
less
noiseless
foot
came
into
the
full
presence
of
captain
holliday
drawn
up
in
all
the
pride
of
his
military
rank
beside
alicia
the
accomplished
daughter
of
the
house
who
if
under
a
shadow
as
many
whispered
wore
that
shadow
as
some
women
wear
a
crown
miss
strange
was
struck
with
admiration
and
turned
upon
them
the
brightest
facet
of
her
vivacious
nature
all
the
time
she
was
saying
to
herself
does
she
know
why
i
am
here
or
does
she
look
upon
me
only
as
an
additional
guest
foisted
upon
her
by
a
thoughtless
parent
there
was
nothing
in
the
manner
of
her
cordial
but
composed
young
hostess
to
show
and
miss
strange
with
but
one
thought
in
mind
since
she
had
caught
the
light
of
feeling
on
the
two
faces
confronting
her
took
the
first
opportunity
that
offered
of
running
over
the
facts
given
her
by
driscoll
to
see
if
any
reconcilement
were
possible
between
them
and
an
innocence
in
which
she
must
henceforth
believe
they
were
certainly
of
a
most
damaging
nature
miss
driscoll
and
four
other
young
ladies
of
her
own
station
in
life
had
formed
themselves
some
two
years
before
into
a
coterie
of
five
called
the
inseparables
they
lunched
together
rode
together
visited
together
so
close
was
the
bond
and
their
mutual
dependence
so
evident
that
it
came
to
be
the
custom
to
invite
the
whole
five
whenever
the
size
of
the
function
warranted
it
in
fact
it
was
far
from
an
uncommon
occurrence
to
see
them
grouped
at
receptions
or
following
one
another
down
the
aisles
of
churches
or
through
the
mazes
of
the
dance
at
balls
or
assemblies
and
no
one
demurred
at
this
for
they
were
all
handsome
and
attractive
girls
till
it
began
to
be
noticed
that
coincident
with
their
presence
some
article
of
value
was
found
missing
from
the
or
from
the
tables
where
wedding
gifts
were
displayed
nothing
was
safe
where
they
went
and
though
in
the
course
of
time
each
article
found
its
way
back
to
its
owner
in
a
manner
as
mysterious
as
its
previous
abstraction
the
scandal
grew
and
whether
with
good
reason
or
bad
finally
settled
about
the
person
of
miss
driscoll
who
was
the
showiest
least
pecuniarily
tempted
and
most
dignified
in
manner
and
speech
of
them
all
some
instances
had
been
given
by
way
of
further
enlightenment
this
is
one
a
theatre
party
was
in
progress
there
were
twelve
in
the
party
five
of
whom
were
the
inseparables
in
the
course
of
the
last
act
another
lady
in
fact
their
chaperon
missed
her
handkerchief
an
almost
priceless
bit
of
lace
positive
that
she
had
brought
it
with
her
into
the
box
she
caused
a
careful
search
but
without
the
least
success
recalling
certain
whispers
she
had
heard
she
noted
which
of
the
five
girls
were
with
her
in
the
box
they
were
miss
driscoll
miss
hughson
miss
yates
and
miss
benedict
miss
west
sat
in
the
box
adjoining
a
fortnight
later
this
handkerchief
reappeared
and
where
among
the
cushions
of
a
yellow
satin
couch
in
her
own
the
inseparables
had
just
made
their
call
and
the
three
who
had
sat
on
the
couch
were
miss
driscoll
miss
hughson
and
miss
benedict
the
next
instance
seemed
to
point
still
more
insistently
toward
the
lady
already
named
miss
yates
had
an
expensive
present
to
buy
and
the
whole
five
inseparables
went
in
an
imposing
group
to
tiffany
s
a
tray
of
rings
was
set
before
them
all
examined
and
eagerly
fingered
the
stock
out
of
which
miss
yates
presently
chose
a
finely
set
emerald
she
was
leading
her
friends
away
when
the
clerk
suddenly
whispered
in
her
ear
i
miss
one
of
the
dismayed
beyond
speech
she
turned
and
consulted
the
faces
of
her
four
companions
who
stared
back
at
her
with
immovable
serenity
but
one
of
them
was
paler
than
usual
and
this
lady
it
was
miss
driscoll
held
her
hands
in
her
muff
and
did
not
offer
to
take
them
out
miss
yates
whose
father
had
completed
a
big
deal
the
week
before
wheeled
round
upon
the
clerk
charge
it
charge
it
at
its
full
value
said
she
i
buy
both
the
and
in
three
weeks
the
purloined
ring
came
back
to
her
in
a
box
of
violets
with
no
name
attached
the
third
instance
was
a
recent
one
and
had
come
to
driscoll
s
ears
directly
from
the
lady
suffering
the
loss
she
was
a
woman
of
uncompromising
integrity
who
felt
it
her
duty
to
make
known
to
this
gentleman
the
following
facts
she
had
just
left
a
studio
reception
and
was
standing
at
the
curb
waiting
for
a
taxicab
to
draw
up
when
a
small
boy
a
street
arab
darted
toward
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
thrusting
into
her
hand
something
small
and
hard
cried
breathlessly
as
he
slipped
away
it
s
yours
ma
am
you
dropped
astonished
for
she
had
not
been
conscious
of
any
loss
she
looked
down
at
her
treasure
trove
and
found
it
to
be
a
small
medallion
which
she
sometimes
wore
on
a
chain
at
her
belt
but
she
had
not
worn
it
that
day
nor
any
day
for
weeks
then
she
remembered
she
had
worn
it
a
month
before
to
a
similar
reception
at
this
same
studio
a
number
of
young
girls
had
stood
about
her
admiring
it
she
remembered
well
who
they
were
the
inseparables
of
course
and
to
please
them
she
had
slipped
it
from
its
chain
then
something
had
happened
something
which
diverted
her
attention
entirely
and
she
had
gone
home
without
the
medallion
had
in
fact
forgotten
it
only
to
recall
its
loss
now
placing
it
in
her
bag
she
looked
hastily
about
her
a
crowd
was
at
her
back
nothing
to
be
distinguished
there
but
in
front
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
stood
a
and
in
one
of
its
windows
she
perceived
a
solitary
figure
looking
out
it
was
that
of
miss
driscoll
s
father
he
could
imagine
her
conclusion
in
vain
he
denied
all
knowledge
of
the
matter
she
told
him
other
stories
which
had
come
to
her
ears
of
thefts
as
mysterious
followed
by
restorations
as
peculiar
as
this
one
finishing
with
it
is
your
daughter
and
people
are
beginning
to
say
and
miss
strange
brooding
over
these
instances
would
have
said
the
same
but
for
miss
driscoll
s
absolute
serenity
of
demeanour
and
complete
abandonment
to
love
these
seemed
incompatible
with
guilt
these
whatever
the
appearances
proclaimed
innocence
an
innocence
she
was
here
to
prove
if
fortune
favoured
and
the
really
guilty
person
s
madness
should
again
break
forth
for
madness
it
would
be
and
nothing
less
for
any
hand
even
the
most
experienced
to
draw
attention
to
itself
by
a
repetition
of
old
tricks
on
an
occasion
so
marked
yet
because
it
would
take
madness
and
madness
knows
no
law
she
prepared
herself
for
the
contingency
under
a
mask
of
girlish
smiles
which
made
her
at
once
the
delight
and
astonishment
of
her
watchful
and
uneasy
host
with
the
exception
of
the
diamonds
worn
by
the
ambassadress
there
was
but
one
jewel
of
consequence
to
be
seen
at
the
dinner
that
night
but
how
great
was
that
consequence
and
with
what
splendour
it
invested
the
snowy
neck
it
adorned
miss
strange
in
compliment
to
the
noble
foreigners
had
put
on
one
of
her
family
heirlooms
a
filigree
pendant
of
extraordinary
sapphires
which
had
once
belonged
to
marie
antoinette
as
its
beauty
flashed
upon
the
women
and
its
value
struck
the
host
the
latter
could
not
restrain
himself
from
casting
an
anxious
eye
about
the
board
in
search
of
some
token
of
the
cupidity
with
which
one
person
there
must
welcome
this
unexpected
sight
naturally
his
first
glance
fell
upon
alicia
seated
opposite
to
him
at
the
other
end
of
the
table
but
her
eyes
were
elsewhere
and
her
smile
for
captain
holliday
and
the
father
s
gaze
travelled
on
taking
up
each
young
girl
s
face
in
turn
all
were
contemplating
miss
strange
and
her
jewels
and
the
cheeks
of
one
were
flushed
and
those
of
the
others
pale
but
whether
with
dread
or
longing
who
could
tell
struck
with
foreboding
but
alive
to
his
duty
as
host
he
forced
his
glances
away
and
did
not
even
allow
himself
to
question
the
motive
or
the
wisdom
of
the
temptation
thus
offered
two
hours
later
and
the
girls
were
all
in
one
room
it
was
a
custom
of
the
inseparables
to
meet
for
a
chat
before
retiring
but
always
alone
and
in
the
room
of
one
of
their
number
but
this
was
a
night
of
innovations
violet
was
not
only
included
but
the
meeting
was
held
in
her
room
her
way
with
girls
was
even
more
fruitful
of
result
than
her
way
with
men
they
might
laugh
at
her
criticize
her
or
even
call
her
names
significant
of
disdain
but
they
never
left
her
long
to
herself
or
missed
an
opportunity
to
make
the
most
of
her
irrepressible
chatter
her
satisfaction
at
entering
this
charmed
circle
did
not
take
from
her
piquancy
and
story
after
story
fell
from
her
lips
as
she
fluttered
about
now
here
now
there
in
her
endless
preparations
for
retirement
she
had
taken
off
her
historic
pendant
after
it
had
been
duly
admired
and
handled
by
all
present
and
with
the
careless
confidence
of
an
assured
ownership
thrown
it
down
upon
the
end
of
her
dresser
which
by
the
way
projected
very
close
to
the
open
window
are
you
going
to
leave
your
jewel
there
whispered
a
voice
in
her
ear
as
a
burst
of
laughter
rang
out
in
response
to
one
of
her
sallies
turning
with
a
simulation
of
wonder
she
met
miss
hughson
s
earnest
gaze
with
the
careless
rejoinder
what
s
the
harm
and
went
on
with
her
story
with
all
the
reckless
ease
of
a
perfectly
thoughtless
nature
miss
hughson
abandoned
her
protest
how
could
she
explain
her
reasons
for
it
to
one
apparently
uninitiated
in
the
scandal
associated
with
their
especial
clique
yes
she
left
the
jewel
there
but
she
locked
her
door
and
quickly
so
that
they
must
all
have
heard
her
before
reaching
their
rooms
then
she
crossed
to
the
window
which
like
all
on
this
side
opened
on
a
balcony
running
the
length
of
the
house
she
was
aware
of
this
balcony
also
of
the
fact
that
only
young
ladies
slept
in
the
corridor
communicating
with
it
but
she
was
not
quite
sure
that
this
one
corridor
accommodated
them
all
if
one
of
them
should
room
elsewhere
miss
driscoll
for
instance
but
no
the
anxiety
displayed
for
the
safety
of
her
jewel
precluded
that
supposition
their
hostess
if
none
of
the
others
was
within
access
of
this
room
and
its
open
window
but
how
about
the
rest
perhaps
the
lights
would
tell
eagerly
the
little
schemer
looked
forth
and
let
her
glances
travel
down
the
full
length
of
the
balcony
two
separate
beams
of
light
shot
across
it
as
she
looked
and
presently
another
and
after
some
waiting
a
fourth
but
the
fifth
failed
to
appear
this
troubled
her
but
not
seriously
two
of
the
girls
might
be
sleeping
in
one
bed
drawing
her
shade
she
finished
her
preparations
for
the
night
then
with
her
kimono
on
lifted
the
pendant
and
thrust
it
into
a
small
box
she
had
taken
from
her
trunk
a
curious
smile
very
unlike
any
she
had
shown
to
man
or
woman
that
day
gave
a
sarcastic
lift
to
her
lips
as
with
a
slow
and
thoughtful
manipulation
of
her
dainty
fingers
she
moved
the
jewel
about
in
this
small
receptacle
and
then
returned
it
after
one
quick
examining
glance
to
the
very
spot
on
the
dresser
from
which
she
had
taken
it
if
only
the
madness
is
great
enough
that
smile
seemed
to
say
truly
it
was
much
to
hope
for
but
a
chance
is
a
chance
and
comforting
herself
with
the
thought
miss
strange
put
out
her
light
and
with
a
hasty
raising
of
the
shade
she
had
previously
pulled
down
took
a
final
look
at
the
prospect
its
aspect
made
her
shudder
a
low
fog
was
rising
from
the
meadows
in
the
far
distance
and
its
ghostliness
under
the
moon
woke
all
sorts
of
uncanny
images
in
her
excited
mind
to
escape
them
she
crept
into
bed
where
she
lay
with
her
eyes
on
the
end
of
her
dresser
she
had
closed
that
half
of
the
french
window
over
which
she
had
drawn
the
shade
but
she
had
left
ajar
the
one
giving
free
access
to
the
jewels
and
when
she
was
not
watching
the
scintillation
of
her
sapphires
in
the
moonlight
she
was
dwelling
in
fixed
attention
on
this
narrow
opening
but
nothing
happened
and
two
o
clock
then
three
o
clock
struck
without
a
dimming
of
the
blue
scintillations
on
the
end
of
her
dresser
then
she
suddenly
sat
up
not
that
she
heard
anything
new
but
that
a
thought
had
come
to
her
if
an
attempt
is
made
so
she
murmured
softly
to
herself
it
will
be
by
she
did
not
finish
something
she
could
not
call
it
sound
set
her
heart
beating
tumultuously
and
listening
listening
watching
watching
she
followed
in
her
imagination
the
approach
down
the
balcony
of
an
almost
inaudible
step
not
daring
to
move
herself
it
seemed
so
near
but
waiting
with
eyes
fixed
for
the
shadow
which
must
fall
across
the
shade
she
had
failed
to
raise
over
that
half
of
the
swinging
window
she
had
so
carefully
left
shut
at
length
she
saw
it
projecting
slowly
across
the
slightly
illuminated
surface
formless
save
for
the
outreaching
hand
it
passed
the
casement
s
edge
nearing
with
pauses
and
hesitations
the
open
gap
beyond
through
which
the
neglected
sapphires
beamed
with
steady
lustre
would
she
ever
see
the
hand
itself
appear
between
the
dresser
and
the
window
frame
yes
there
it
comes
small
delicate
and
startlingly
white
threading
that
gap
darting
with
the
suddenness
of
a
serpent
s
tongue
toward
the
dresser
and
disappearing
again
with
the
pendant
in
its
clutch
as
she
realizes
this
she
is
but
young
you
know
as
she
sees
her
bait
taken
and
the
hardly
expected
event
fulfilled
her
breath
sped
forth
in
a
sigh
which
sent
the
intruder
flying
and
so
startled
herself
that
she
sank
back
in
terror
on
her
pillow
the
had
sounded
its
musical
chimes
through
the
halls
the
ambassador
and
his
wife
had
responded
so
had
most
of
the
young
gentlemen
and
ladies
but
the
daughter
of
the
house
was
not
amongst
them
nor
miss
strange
whom
one
would
naturally
expect
to
see
down
first
of
all
these
two
absences
puzzled
driscoll
what
might
they
not
portend
but
his
suspense
at
least
in
one
regard
was
short
before
his
guests
were
well
seated
miss
driscoll
entered
from
the
terrace
in
company
with
captain
holliday
in
her
arms
she
carried
a
huge
bunch
of
roses
and
was
looking
very
beautiful
her
father
s
heart
warmed
at
the
sight
no
shadow
from
the
night
rested
upon
her
but
miss
strange
where
was
she
he
could
not
feel
quite
easy
till
he
knew
have
any
of
you
seen
miss
strange
he
asked
as
they
sat
down
at
table
and
his
eyes
sought
the
inseparables
five
lovely
heads
were
shaken
some
carelessly
some
wonderingly
and
one
with
a
quick
forced
smile
but
he
was
in
no
mood
to
discriminate
and
he
had
beckoned
one
of
the
servants
to
him
when
a
step
was
heard
at
the
door
and
the
delinquent
slid
in
and
took
her
place
in
a
shamefaced
manner
suggestive
of
a
cause
deeper
than
mere
tardiness
in
fact
she
had
what
might
be
called
a
frightened
air
and
stared
into
her
plate
avoiding
every
eye
which
was
certainly
not
natural
to
her
what
did
it
mean
and
why
as
she
made
a
poor
attempt
at
eating
did
four
of
the
inseparables
exchange
glances
of
doubt
and
dismay
and
then
concentrate
their
looks
upon
his
daughter
that
alicia
failed
to
notice
this
but
sat
abloom
above
her
roses
now
fastened
in
a
great
bunch
upon
her
breast
offered
him
some
comfort
yet
for
all
the
volubility
of
his
chief
guests
the
meal
was
a
great
trial
to
his
patience
as
well
as
a
poor
preparation
for
the
hour
when
the
noble
pair
gone
he
stepped
into
the
library
to
find
miss
strange
awaiting
him
with
one
hand
behind
her
back
and
a
piteous
look
on
her
infantile
features
o
driscoll
she
began
and
then
he
saw
that
a
group
of
anxious
girls
hovered
in
her
rear
my
pendant
my
beautiful
pendant
it
is
gone
somebody
reached
in
from
the
balcony
and
took
it
from
my
dresser
in
the
night
of
course
it
was
to
frighten
me
all
of
the
girls
told
me
not
to
leave
it
there
but
i
i
can
not
make
them
give
it
back
and
papa
is
so
particular
about
this
jewel
that
i
m
afraid
to
go
home
won
t
you
tell
them
it
s
no
joke
and
see
that
i
get
it
again
i
won
t
be
so
careless
another
hardly
believing
his
eyes
hardly
believing
his
ears
she
was
so
perfectly
the
spoiled
child
detected
in
a
fault
he
looked
sternly
about
upon
the
girls
and
bade
them
end
the
jest
and
produce
the
gems
at
once
but
not
one
of
them
spoke
and
not
one
of
them
moved
only
his
daughter
grew
pale
until
the
roses
seemed
a
mockery
and
the
steady
stare
of
her
large
eyes
was
almost
too
much
for
him
to
bear
the
anguish
of
this
gave
asperity
to
his
manner
and
in
a
strange
hoarse
tone
he
loudly
cried
one
of
you
did
this
which
if
it
was
you
alicia
speak
i
am
in
no
mood
for
nonsense
i
want
to
know
whose
foot
traversed
the
balcony
and
whose
hand
abstracted
these
a
continued
silence
deepening
into
painful
embarrassment
for
all
driscoll
eyed
them
in
anguish
then
turning
to
miss
strange
was
still
further
thrown
off
his
balance
by
seeing
her
pretty
head
droop
and
her
gaze
fall
in
confusion
oh
it
s
easy
enough
to
tell
whose
foot
traversed
the
balcony
she
murmured
it
left
this
and
drawing
forward
her
hand
she
held
out
to
view
a
small
slipper
i
found
it
outside
my
window
she
explained
i
hoped
i
should
not
have
to
show
a
gasp
of
uncontrollable
feeling
from
the
surrounding
group
of
girls
then
absolute
stillness
i
fail
to
recognize
it
observed
driscoll
taking
it
in
his
hand
whose
slipper
is
this
he
asked
in
a
manner
not
to
be
gainsaid
still
no
reply
then
as
he
continued
to
eye
the
girls
one
after
another
a
voice
the
last
he
expected
to
hear
spoke
and
his
daughter
cried
it
is
mine
but
it
was
not
i
who
walked
in
it
down
the
alicia
a
month
s
apprehension
was
in
that
cry
the
silence
the
emotion
brooding
in
the
air
was
intolerable
a
fresh
young
laugh
broke
it
oh
exclaimed
a
roguish
voice
i
knew
that
you
were
all
in
it
but
the
especial
one
who
wore
the
slipper
and
grabbed
the
pendant
can
not
hope
to
hide
herself
her
will
give
her
amazement
on
every
face
and
a
convulsive
movement
in
one
hand
you
see
the
airy
little
being
went
on
in
her
light
way
i
have
some
awfully
funny
tricks
i
am
always
being
scolded
for
them
but
somehow
i
don
t
improve
one
is
to
keep
my
jewelry
bright
with
a
strange
foreign
paste
an
old
frenchwoman
once
gave
me
in
paris
it
s
of
a
vivid
red
and
stains
the
fingers
dreadfully
if
you
don
t
take
care
not
even
water
will
take
it
off
see
mine
i
used
that
paste
on
my
pendant
last
night
just
after
you
left
me
and
being
awfully
sleepy
i
didn
t
stop
to
rub
it
off
if
your
are
not
red
you
never
touched
the
pendant
miss
driscoll
oh
see
they
are
as
white
as
milk
but
some
one
took
the
sapphires
and
i
owe
that
person
a
scolding
as
well
as
myself
was
it
you
miss
hughson
you
miss
yates
or
and
here
she
paused
before
miss
west
oh
you
have
your
gloves
on
you
are
the
guilty
one
and
her
laugh
rang
out
like
a
peal
of
bells
robbing
her
next
sentence
of
even
a
suggestion
of
sarcasm
oh
what
a
she
cried
how
you
have
deceived
me
whoever
would
have
thought
you
to
be
the
one
to
play
the
mischief
who
indeed
of
all
the
five
she
was
the
one
who
was
considered
absolutely
immune
from
suspicion
ever
since
the
night
barnum
s
handkerchief
had
been
taken
and
she
not
in
the
box
eyes
which
had
surveyed
miss
driscoll
askance
now
rose
in
wonder
toward
hers
and
failed
to
fall
again
because
of
the
stoniness
into
which
her
features
had
settled
miss
west
i
know
you
will
be
glad
to
remove
your
gloves
miss
strange
certainly
has
a
right
to
know
her
special
tormentor
spoke
up
her
host
in
as
natural
a
voice
as
his
great
relief
would
allow
but
the
cold
woman
remained
without
a
movement
she
was
not
deceived
by
the
banter
of
the
moment
she
knew
that
to
all
of
the
others
if
not
to
peter
strange
s
odd
little
daughter
it
was
the
thief
who
was
being
spotted
and
brought
thus
hilariously
to
light
and
her
eyes
grew
hard
and
her
lips
grey
and
she
failed
to
unglove
the
hands
upon
which
all
glances
were
concentrated
you
do
not
need
to
see
my
hands
i
confess
to
taking
the
caroline
a
heart
overcome
by
shock
had
thrown
up
this
cry
miss
west
eyed
her
disdainfully
miss
strange
has
called
it
a
jest
she
coldly
commented
why
should
you
suggest
anything
of
a
graver
character
alicia
brought
thus
to
bay
and
by
one
she
had
trusted
most
stepped
quickly
forward
and
quivering
with
vague
doubts
aghast
before
possibilities
she
tremulously
remarked
we
did
not
sleep
together
last
night
you
had
to
come
into
my
room
to
get
my
slippers
why
did
you
do
this
what
was
in
your
mind
caroline
a
steady
look
a
low
laugh
choked
with
many
emotions
answered
her
do
you
want
me
to
reply
alicia
or
shall
we
let
it
pass
answer
it
was
driscoll
who
spoke
alicia
had
shrunk
back
almost
to
where
a
little
figure
was
cowering
with
wide
eyes
fixed
in
something
like
terror
on
the
aroused
father
s
face
then
hear
me
murmured
the
girl
entrapped
and
suddenly
desperate
i
wore
alicia
s
slippers
and
i
took
the
jewels
because
it
was
time
that
an
end
should
come
to
your
mutual
dissimulation
the
love
i
once
felt
for
her
she
has
herself
deliberately
killed
i
had
a
lover
she
took
him
i
had
faith
in
life
in
honour
and
in
friendship
she
destroyed
all
a
thief
she
has
dared
to
aspire
to
him
and
you
condoned
her
fault
you
with
your
craven
restoration
of
her
booty
thought
the
matter
cleared
and
her
a
fit
mate
for
a
man
of
highest
miss
west
no
one
had
ever
heard
that
tone
in
driscoll
s
voice
before
before
you
say
another
word
calculated
to
mislead
these
ladies
let
me
say
that
this
hand
never
returned
any
one
s
booty
or
had
anything
to
do
with
the
restoration
of
any
abstracted
article
you
have
been
caught
in
a
net
miss
west
from
which
you
can
not
escape
by
slandering
my
innocent
innocent
all
the
tragedy
latent
in
this
peculiar
girl
s
nature
blazed
forth
in
the
word
alicia
face
me
are
you
innocent
who

unnatural

how
about

was

that
you

of

in
miss
hughson
edging
away
from
the
friend
to
whose
honour
she
would
have
pinned
her
faith
an
hour
before
i
remember
now
seeing
her
lean
over
the
railing
to
adjust
the
old
lady
s
with
a
start
caroline
west
turned
a
tragic
gaze
upon
the
speaker
you
think
me
guilty
of
all
because
of
what
i
did
last
night
why
shouldn
t
i
and
you
anna
alicia
has
my
sympathy
murmured
miss
benedict
yet
the
wild
girl
persisted
but
i
have
told
you
my
provocation
you
can
not
believe
that
i
am
guilty
of
her
sin
not
if
you
look
at
her
as
i
am
looking
but
their
glances
hardly
followed
her
pointing
finger
her
friends
the
comrades
of
her
youth
the
inseparables
with
their
secret
oath
one
and
all
held
themselves
aloof
struck
by
the
perfidy
they
were
only
just
beginning
to
take
in
smitten
with
despair
for
these
girls
were
her
life
she
gave
one
wild
leap
and
sank
on
her
knees
before
alicia
o
speak
she
began
forgive
me
and
a
tremble
seized
her
throat
she
ceased
to
speak
and
let
fall
her
partially
uplifted
hands
the
cheery
sound
of
men
s
voices
had
drifted
in
from
the
terrace
and
the
figure
of
captain
holliday
could
be
seen
passing
by
the
shudder
which
shook
caroline
west
communicated
itself
to
alicia
driscoll
and
the
former
rising
quickly
the
two
women
surveyed
each
other
possibly
for
the
first
time
with
open
soul
and
a
complete
understanding
caroline
murmured
the
one
alicia
pleaded
the
other
caroline
trust
me
said
alicia
driscoll
in
that
moving
voice
of
hers
which
more
than
her
beauty
caught
and
retained
all
hearts
you
have
served
me
ill
but
it
was
not
all
undeserved
girls
she
went
on
eyeing
both
them
and
her
father
with
the
wistfulness
of
a
breaking
heart
neither
caroline
nor
myself
are
worthy
of
captain
holliday
s
love
caroline
has
told
you
her
fault
but
mine
is
perhaps
a
worse
one
the
ring
the
scarf
the
diamond
pins
i
took
them
all
took
them
if
i
did
not
retain
them
a
curse
has
been
over
my
life
the
curse
of
a
longing
i
could
not
combat
but
love
was
working
a
change
in
me
since
i
have
known
captain
holliday
but
that
s
all
over
i
was
mad
to
think
i
could
be
happy
with
such
memories
in
my
life
i
shall
never
marry
now
or
touch
jewels
again
my
own
or
another
s
father
father
you
won
t
go
back
on
your
girl
i
couldn
t
see
caroline
suffer
for
what
i
have
done
you
will
pardon
me
and
help
help
her
voice
choked
she
flung
herself
into
her
father
s
arms
his
head
bent
over
hers
and
for
an
instant
not
a
soul
in
the
room
moved
then
miss
hughson
gave
a
spring
and
caught
her
by
the
hand
we
are
inseparable
said
she
and
kissed
the
hand
murmuring
now
is
our
time
to
show
then
other
lips
fell
upon
those
cold
and
trembling
fingers
which
seemed
to
warm
under
these
embraces
and
then
a
tear
it
came
from
the
hard
eye
of
caroline
and
remained
a
sacred
secret
between
the
two
you
have
your
pendant
driscoll
s
suffering
eye
shone
down
on
violet
strange
s
uplifted
face
as
she
advanced
to
say
preparatory
to
departure
yes
she
acknowledged
but
hardly
i
fear
your
and
the
answer
astonished
her
i
am
not
sure
that
the
real
alicia
will
not
make
her
father
happier
than
the
unreal
one
has
ever
and
captain
holliday
he
may
come
to
feel
the
then
i
do
not
quit
in
disgrace
you
depart
with
my
when
a
certain
personage
was
told
of
the
success
of
miss
strange
s
latest
manoeuvre
he
remarked
the
little
one
progresses
we
shall
have
to
give
her
a
case
of
prime
importance
end
of
problem
i
problem
ii
the
second
bullet
you
must
see
no
she
s
a
most
unhappy
woman
husband
and
child
both
taken
from
her
in
a
moment
and
now
all
means
of
living
as
well
unless
some
happy
thought
of
yours
some
inspiration
of
your
genius
shows
us
a
way
of
her
claims
to
the
policy
voided
by
this
cry
of
but
the
small
wise
head
of
violet
strange
continued
its
slow
shake
of
decided
refusal
i
m
sorry
she
protested
but
it
s
quite
out
of
my
province
i
m
too
young
to
meddle
with
so
serious
a
not
when
you
can
save
a
bereaved
woman
the
only
possible
compensation
left
her
by
untoward
fate
let
the
police
try
their
hand
at
they
have
had
no
success
with
the
or
you
nor
i
and
you
expect
yes
miss
strange
i
expect
you
to
find
the
missing
bullet
which
will
settle
the
fact
that
murder
and
not
suicide
ended
george
hammond
s
life
if
you
can
not
then
a
long
litigation
awaits
this
poor
widow
ending
as
such
litigation
usually
does
in
favour
of
the
stronger
party
there
s
the
alternative
if
you
once
saw
her
but
that
s
what
i
m
not
willing
to
do
if
i
once
saw
her
i
should
yield
to
her
importunities
and
attempt
the
seemingly
impossible
my
instincts
bid
me
say
no
give
me
something
easier
things
are
not
so
remunerative
there
s
money
in
this
affair
if
the
insurance
company
is
forced
to
pay
up
i
can
offer
you
what
there
was
eagerness
in
the
tone
despite
her
effort
at
nonchalance
the
other
smiled
imperceptibly
and
briefly
named
the
sum
it
was
larger
than
she
had
expected
this
her
visitor
saw
by
the
way
her
eyelids
fell
and
the
peculiar
stillness
which
for
an
instant
held
her
vivacity
in
check
and
you
think
i
can
earn
that
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
in
an
eagerness
as
honest
as
it
was
unrestrained
he
could
hardly
conceal
his
amazement
her
desire
was
so
evident
and
the
cause
of
it
so
difficult
to
understand
he
knew
she
wanted
money
that
was
her
avowed
reason
for
entering
into
this
uncongenial
work
but
to
want
it
so
much
he
glanced
at
her
person
it
was
simply
clad
but
very
expensively
how
expensively
it
was
his
business
to
know
then
he
took
in
the
room
in
which
they
sat
simplicity
again
but
the
simplicity
of
high
art
the
of
one
rich
enough
to
indulge
in
the
final
luxury
of
a
highly
cultivated
taste
viz
unostentatious
elegance
and
the
subjection
of
each
carefully
chosen
ornament
to
the
general
effect
what
did
this
favoured
child
of
fortune
lack
that
she
could
be
reached
by
such
a
plea
when
her
whole
being
revolted
from
the
nature
of
the
task
he
offered
her
it
was
a
question
not
new
to
him
but
one
he
had
never
heard
answered
and
was
not
likely
to
hear
answered
now
but
the
fact
remained
that
the
consent
he
had
thought
dependent
upon
sympathetic
interest
could
be
reached
much
more
readily
by
the
promise
of
large
emolument
and
he
owned
to
a
feeling
of
secret
disappointment
even
while
he
recognized
the
value
of
the
discovery
but
his
satisfaction
in
the
latter
if
satisfaction
it
were
was
of
very
short
duration
almost
immediately
he
observed
a
change
in
her
the
sparkle
which
had
shone
in
the
eye
whose
depths
he
had
never
been
able
to
penetrate
had
dissipated
itself
in
something
like
a
tear
and
she
spoke
up
in
that
vigorous
tone
no
one
but
himself
had
ever
heard
as
she
said
no
the
sum
is
a
good
one
and
i
could
use
it
but
i
will
not
waste
my
energy
on
a
case
i
do
not
believe
in
the
man
shot
himself
he
was
a
speculator
and
probably
had
good
reason
for
his
act
even
his
wife
acknowledges
that
he
has
lately
had
more
losses
than
see
her
she
has
something
to
tell
you
which
never
got
into
the
you
say
that
you
know
that
on
my
honour
miss
violet
pondered
then
suddenly
succumbed
let
her
come
then
prompt
to
the
hour
i
will
receive
her
at
three
later
i
have
a
tea
and
two
party
calls
to
her
visitor
rose
to
leave
he
had
been
able
to
subdue
all
evidence
of
his
extreme
gratification
and
now
took
on
a
formal
air
in
dismissing
a
guest
miss
strange
was
invariably
the
society
belle
and
that
only
this
he
had
come
to
recognize
the
case
well
known
at
the
time
was
in
the
fewest
possible
words
as
follows
on
a
sultry
night
in
september
a
young
couple
living
in
one
of
the
large
apartment
houses
in
the
extreme
upper
portion
of
manhattan
were
so
annoyed
by
the
incessant
crying
of
a
child
in
the
adjoining
suite
that
they
got
up
he
to
smoke
and
she
to
sit
in
the
window
for
a
possible
breath
of
cool
air
they
were
congratulating
themselves
upon
the
wisdom
they
had
shown
in
thus
giving
up
all
thought
of
sleep
for
the
child
s
crying
had
not
ceased
when
it
may
have
been
two
o
clock
and
it
may
have
been
a
little
later
there
came
from
somewhere
near
the
sharp
and
somewhat
peculiar
detonation
of
a
he
thought
it
came
from
above
she
from
the
rear
and
they
were
staring
at
each
other
in
the
helpless
wonder
of
the
moment
when
they
were
struck
by
the
silence
the
baby
had
ceased
to
cry
all
was
as
still
in
the
adjoining
apartment
as
in
their
own
too
still
much
too
still
their
mutual
stare
turned
to
one
of
horror
it
came
from
there
whispered
the
wife
some
accident
has
occurred
to
or
hammond
we
ought
to
go
her
words
very
tremulous
ones
were
broken
by
a
shout
from
below
they
were
standing
in
their
window
and
had
evidently
been
seen
by
a
passing
policeman
anything
wrong
up
there
they
heard
him
cry
saunders
immediately
looked
out
nothing
wrong
here
he
called
down
they
were
but
two
stories
from
the
pavement
but
i
m
not
so
sure
about
the
rear
apartment
we
thought
we
heard
a
shot
hadn
t
you
better
come
up
officer
my
wife
is
nervous
about
it
i
ll
meet
you
at
the
and
show
you
the
the
officer
nodded
and
stepped
in
the
young
couple
hastily
donned
some
wraps
and
by
the
time
he
appeared
on
their
floor
they
were
ready
to
accompany
him
meanwhile
no
disturbance
was
apparent
anywhere
else
in
the
house
until
the
policeman
rang
the
bell
of
the
hammond
apartment
then
voices
began
to
be
heard
and
doors
to
open
above
and
below
but
not
the
one
before
which
the
policeman
stood
another
ring
and
this
time
an
insistent
one
and
still
no
response
the
officer
s
hand
was
rising
for
the
third
time
when
there
came
a
sound
of
fluttering
from
behind
the
panels
against
which
he
had
laid
his
ear
and
finally
a
choked
voice
uttering
unintelligible
words
then
a
hand
began
to
struggle
with
the
lock
and
the
door
slowly
opening
disclosed
a
woman
clad
in
a
hastily
donned
wrapper
and
giving
every
evidence
of
extreme
fright
oh
she
exclaimed
seeing
only
the
compassionate
faces
of
her
neighbours
you
heard
it
too
a
from
there
there
my
husband
s
room
i
have
not
dared
to
go
i
i
o
have
mercy
and
see
if
anything
is
wrong
it
is
so
still
so
still
and
only
a
moment
ago
the
baby
was
crying
saunders
saunders
why
is
it
so
still
she
had
fallen
into
her
neighbour
s
arms
the
hand
with
which
she
had
pointed
out
a
certain
door
had
sunk
to
her
side
and
she
appeared
to
be
on
the
verge
of
collapse
the
officer
eyed
her
sternly
while
noting
her
appearance
which
was
that
of
a
woman
hastily
risen
from
bed
where
were
you
he
asked
not
with
your
husband
and
child
or
you
would
know
what
had
happened
i
was
sleeping
down
the
hall
she
managed
to
gasp
out
i
m
not
well
i
oh
why
do
you
all
stand
still
and
do
nothing
my
baby
s
in
there
go
go
and
with
sudden
energy
she
sprang
upright
her
eyes
wide
open
and
burning
her
small
well
featured
face
white
as
the
linen
she
sought
to
hide
the
officer
demurred
no
longer
in
another
instant
he
was
trying
the
door
at
which
she
was
again
pointing
it
was
locked
glancing
back
at
the
woman
now
cowering
almost
to
the
floor
he
pounded
at
the
door
and
asked
the
man
inside
to
open
no
answer
came
back
with
a
sharp
turn
he
glanced
again
at
the
wife
you
say
that
your
husband
is
in
this
room
she
nodded
gasping
faintly
and
the
child
he
turned
back
listened
then
beckoned
to
saunders
we
shall
have
to
break
our
way
in
said
he
put
your
shoulder
well
to
the
door
now
the
hinges
of
the
door
creaked
the
lock
gave
way
this
special
officer
weighed
two
hundred
and
as
he
found
out
next
day
and
a
prolonged
and
sweeping
crash
told
the
rest
hammond
gave
a
low
cry
and
straining
forward
from
where
she
crouched
in
terror
on
the
floor
searched
the
faces
of
the
two
men
for
some
hint
of
what
they
saw
in
the
space
beyond
something
dreadful
something
which
made
saunders
come
rushing
back
with
a
shout
take
her
away
take
her
to
our
apartment
jennie
she
must
not
see
not
see
he
realized
the
futility
of
his
words
as
his
gaze
fell
on
the
young
woman
who
had
risen
up
at
his
approach
and
now
stood
gazing
at
him
without
speech
without
movement
but
with
a
glare
of
terror
in
her
eyes
which
gave
him
his
first
realization
of
human
misery
his
own
glance
fell
before
it
if
he
had
followed
his
instinct
he
would
have
fled
the
house
rather
than
answer
the
question
of
her
look
and
the
attitude
of
her
whole
frozen
body
perhaps
in
mercy
to
his
speechless
terror
perhaps
in
mercy
to
herself
she
was
the
one
who
at
last
found
the
word
which
voiced
their
mutual
anguish
dead
no
answer
none
was
needed
and
my
baby
o
that
cry
it
curdled
the
hearts
of
all
who
heard
it
it
shook
the
souls
of
men
and
women
both
inside
and
outside
the
apartment
then
all
was
forgotten
in
the
wild
rush
she
made
the
wife
and
mother
had
flung
herself
upon
the
scene
and
side
by
side
with
the
not
unmoved
policeman
stood
looking
down
upon
the
desolation
made
in
one
fatal
instant
in
her
home
and
heart
they
lay
there
together
both
past
help
both
quite
dead
the
child
had
simply
been
strangled
by
the
weight
of
his
father
s
arm
which
lay
directly
across
the
upturned
little
throat
but
the
father
was
a
victim
of
the
shot
they
had
heard
there
was
blood
on
his
breast
and
a
pistol
in
his
hand
suicide
the
horrible
truth
was
patent
no
wonder
they
wanted
to
hold
the
young
widow
back
her
neighbour
saunders
crept
in
on
tiptoe
and
put
her
arms
about
the
swaying
fainting
woman
but
there
was
nothing
to
say
absolutely
nothing
at
least
they
thought
not
but
when
they
saw
her
throw
herself
down
not
by
her
husband
but
by
the
child
and
drag
it
out
from
under
that
strangling
arm
and
hug
and
kiss
it
and
call
out
wildly
for
a
doctor
the
officer
endeavoured
to
interfere
and
yet
could
not
find
the
heart
to
do
so
though
he
knew
the
child
was
dead
and
should
not
according
to
all
the
rules
of
the
coroner
s
office
be
moved
before
that
official
arrived
yet
because
no
mother
could
be
convinced
of
a
fact
like
this
he
let
her
sit
with
it
on
the
floor
and
try
all
her
little
arts
to
revive
it
while
he
gave
orders
to
the
janitor
and
waited
himself
for
the
arrival
of
doctor
and
coroner
she
was
still
sitting
there
in
misery
alternately
fondling
the
little
body
and
drawing
back
to
consult
its
small
set
features
for
some
sign
of
life
when
the
doctor
came
and
after
one
look
at
the
child
drew
it
softly
from
her
arms
and
laid
it
quietly
in
the
crib
from
which
its
father
had
evidently
lifted
it
but
a
short
time
before
then
he
turned
back
to
her
and
found
her
on
her
feet
upheld
by
her
two
friends
she
had
understood
his
action
and
without
a
groan
had
accepted
her
fate
indeed
she
seemed
incapable
of
any
further
speech
or
action
she
was
staring
down
at
her
husband
s
body
which
she
for
the
first
time
seemed
fully
to
see
was
her
look
one
of
grief
or
of
resentment
for
the
part
he
had
played
so
unintentionally
in
her
child
s
death
it
was
hard
to
tell
and
when
with
slowly
rising
finger
she
pointed
to
the
pistol
so
tightly
clutched
in
the
other
outstretched
hand
no
one
there
and
by
this
time
the
room
was
full
could
foretell
what
her
words
would
be
when
her
tongue
regained
its
usage
and
she
could
speak
what
she
did
say
was
this
is
there
a
bullet
gone
did
he
fire
off
that
pistol
a
question
so
manifestly
one
of
delirium
that
no
one
answered
it
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
though
she
said
nothing
till
her
glance
had
passed
all
around
the
walls
of
the
room
to
where
a
window
stood
open
to
the
night
its
lower
sash
being
entirely
raised
there
look
there
she
cried
with
a
commanding
accent
and
throwing
up
her
hands
sank
a
dead
weight
into
the
arms
of
those
supporting
her
no
one
understood
but
naturally
more
than
one
rushed
to
the
window
an
open
space
was
before
them
here
lay
the
fields
not
yet
parcelled
out
into
lots
and
built
upon
but
it
was
not
upon
these
they
looked
but
upon
the
strong
trellis
which
they
found
there
which
if
it
supported
no
vine
formed
a
veritable
ladder
between
this
window
and
the
ground
could
she
have
meant
to
call
attention
to
this
fact
and
were
her
words
expressive
of
another
idea
than
the
obvious
one
of
suicide
if
so
to
what
lengths
a
woman
s
imagination
can
go
or
so
their
combined
looks
seemed
to
proclaim
when
to
their
utter
astonishment
they
saw
the
officer
who
had
presented
a
calm
appearance
up
till
now
shift
his
position
and
with
a
surprised
grunt
direct
their
eyes
to
a
portion
of
the
wall
just
visible
beyond
the
curtains
of
the
bed
the
mirror
hanging
there
showed
a
breakage
such
as
follows
the
sharp
impact
of
a
bullet
or
a
fiercely
projected
stone
he
fired
two
shots
one
went
wild
the
other
straight
it
was
the
officer
delivering
his
opinion
saunders
returning
from
the
distant
room
where
he
had
assisted
in
carrying
hammond
cast
a
look
at
the
shattered
glass
and
remarked
forcibly
i
heard
but
one
and
i
was
sitting
up
disturbed
by
that
poor
infant
jennie
did
you
hear
more
than
one
shot
he
asked
turning
toward
his
wife
no
she
answered
but
not
with
the
readiness
he
had
evidently
expected
i
heard
only
one
but
that
was
not
quite
usual
in
its
tone
i
m
used
to
guns
she
explained
turning
to
the
officer
my
father
was
an
army
man
and
he
taught
me
very
early
to
load
and
fire
a
pistol
there
was
a
prolonged
sound
to
this
shot
something
like
an
echo
of
itself
following
close
upon
the
first
ping
didn
t
you
notice
that
warren
i
remember
something
of
the
kind
her
husband
allowed
he
shot
twice
and
quickly
interposed
the
policeman
sententiously
we
shall
find
a
spent
bullet
back
of
that
but
when
upon
the
arrival
of
the
coroner
an
investigation
was
made
of
the
mirror
and
the
wall
behind
no
bullet
was
found
either
there
or
any
where
else
in
the
room
save
in
the
dead
man
s
breast
nor
had
more
than
one
been
shot
from
his
pistol
as
five
full
chambers
testified
the
case
which
seemed
so
simple
had
its
mysteries
but
the
assertion
made
by
saunders
no
longer
carried
weight
nor
was
the
evidence
offered
by
the
broken
mirror
considered
as
indubitably
establishing
the
fact
that
a
second
shot
had
been
fired
in
the
room
yet
it
was
equally
evident
that
the
charge
which
had
entered
the
dead
speculator
s
breast
had
not
been
delivered
at
the
close
range
of
the
pistol
found
clutched
in
his
hand
there
were
no
to
be
discerned
on
his
or
on
the
flesh
beneath
thus
anomaly
confronted
anomaly
leaving
open
but
one
other
theory
that
the
bullet
found
in
hammond
s
breast
came
from
the
window
and
the
one
he
shot
went
out
of
it
but
this
would
necessitate
his
having
shot
his
pistol
from
a
point
far
removed
from
where
he
was
found
and
his
wound
was
such
as
made
it
difficult
to
believe
that
he
would
stagger
far
if
at
all
after
its
infliction
yet
because
the
coroner
was
both
conscientious
and
alert
he
caused
a
most
rigorous
search
to
be
made
of
the
ground
overlooked
by
the
above
mentioned
window
a
search
in
which
the
police
joined
but
which
was
without
any
result
save
that
of
rousing
the
attention
of
people
in
the
neighbourhood
and
leading
to
a
story
being
circulated
of
a
man
seen
some
time
the
night
before
crossing
the
fields
in
a
great
hurry
but
as
no
further
particulars
were
forthcoming
and
not
even
a
description
of
the
man
to
be
had
no
emphasis
would
have
been
laid
upon
this
story
had
it
not
transpired
that
the
moment
a
report
of
it
had
come
to
hammond
s
ears
why
is
there
always
some
one
to
carry
these
reports
she
roused
from
the
torpor
into
which
she
had
fallen
and
in
wild
fashion
exclaimed
i
knew
it
i
expected
it
he
was
shot
through
the
window
and
by
that
wretch
he
never
shot
violent
declarations
which
trailed
off
into
the
one
continuous
wail
o
my
baby
my
poor
baby
such
words
even
though
the
fruit
of
delirium
merited
some
sort
of
attention
or
so
this
good
coroner
thought
and
as
soon
as
opportunity
offered
and
she
was
sufficiently
sane
and
quiet
to
respond
to
his
questions
he
asked
her
whom
she
had
meant
by
that
wretch
and
what
reason
she
had
or
thought
she
had
of
attributing
her
husband
s
death
to
any
other
agency
than
his
own
disgust
with
life
and
then
it
was
that
his
sympathies
although
greatly
roused
in
her
favour
began
to
wane
she
met
the
question
with
a
cold
stare
followed
by
a
few
ambiguous
words
out
of
which
he
could
make
nothing
had
she
said
wretch
she
did
not
remember
they
must
not
be
influenced
by
anything
she
might
have
uttered
in
her
first
grief
she
was
insane
at
the
time
but
of
one
thing
they
might
be
sure
her
husband
had
not
shot
himself
he
was
too
much
afraid
of
death
for
such
an
act
besides
he
was
too
happy
whatever
folks
might
say
he
was
too
fond
of
his
family
to
wish
to
leave
it
nor
did
the
coroner
or
any
other
official
succeed
in
eliciting
anything
further
from
her
even
when
she
was
asked
with
cruel
insistence
how
she
explained
the
fact
that
the
baby
was
found
lying
on
the
floor
instead
of
in
its
crib
her
only
answer
was
his
father
was
trying
to
soothe
it
the
child
was
crying
dreadfully
as
you
have
heard
from
those
who
were
kept
awake
by
him
that
night
and
my
husband
was
carrying
him
about
when
the
shot
came
which
caused
george
to
fall
and
overlay
the
baby
in
his
carrying
a
baby
about
with
a
loaded
pistol
in
his
hand
came
back
in
stern
retort
she
had
no
answer
for
this
she
admitted
when
informed
that
the
bullet
extracted
from
her
husband
s
body
had
been
found
to
correspond
exactly
with
those
remaining
in
the
five
chambers
of
the
pistol
taken
from
his
hand
that
he
was
not
only
the
owner
of
this
pistol
but
was
in
the
habit
of
sleeping
with
it
under
his
pillow
but
beyond
that
nothing
and
this
reticence
as
well
as
her
manner
which
was
cold
and
repellent
told
against
her
a
verdict
of
suicide
was
rendered
by
the
coroner
s
jury
and
the
company
in
which
hammond
had
but
lately
insured
himself
for
a
large
sum
taking
advantage
of
the
suicide
clause
embodied
in
the
policy
announced
its
determination
of
not
paying
the
same
such
was
the
situation
as
known
to
violet
strange
and
the
general
public
on
the
day
she
was
asked
to
see
hammond
and
learn
what
might
alter
her
opinion
as
to
the
justice
of
this
verdict
and
the
stand
taken
by
the
shuler
life
insurance
company
the
clock
on
the
mantel
in
miss
strange
s
boudoir
had
struck
three
and
violet
was
gazing
in
some
impatience
at
the
door
when
there
came
a
gentle
knock
upon
it
and
the
maid
one
of
the
elderly
not
youthful
kind
ushered
in
her
expected
visitor
you
are
hammond
she
asked
in
natural
awe
of
the
too
black
figure
outlined
so
sharply
against
the
deep
pink
of
the
room
the
answer
was
a
slow
lifting
of
the
veil
which
shadowed
the
features
she
knew
only
from
the
cuts
she
had
seen
in
newspapers
you
are
miss
strange
stammered
her
visitor
the
young
lady
who
i
am
chimed
in
a
voice
as
ringing
as
it
was
sweet
i
am
the
person
you
have
come
here
to
see
and
this
is
my
home
but
that
does
not
make
me
less
interested
in
the
unhappy
or
less
desirous
of
serving
them
certainly
you
have
met
with
the
two
greatest
losses
which
can
come
to
a
woman
i
know
your
story
well
enough
to
say
that
but
what
have
you
to
tell
me
in
proof
that
you
should
not
lose
your
anticipated
income
as
well
something
vital
i
hope
else
i
can
not
help
you
something
which
you
should
have
told
the
coroner
s
jury
and
did
the
flush
which
was
the
sole
answer
these
words
called
forth
did
not
take
from
the
refinement
of
the
young
widow
s
expression
but
rather
added
to
it
violet
watched
it
in
its
ebb
and
flow
and
seriously
affected
by
it
why
she
did
not
know
for
hammond
had
made
no
other
appeal
either
by
look
or
gesture
pushed
forward
a
chair
and
begged
her
visitor
to
be
seated
we
can
converse
in
perfect
safety
here
she
said
when
you
feel
quite
equal
to
it
let
me
hear
what
you
have
to
communicate
it
will
never
go
any
further
i
could
not
do
the
work
i
do
if
i
felt
it
necessary
to
have
a
but
you
are
so
young
and
so
so
so
inexperienced
you
would
say
and
so
evidently
a
member
of
what
new
yorkers
call
do
not
let
that
trouble
you
my
inexperience
is
not
likely
to
last
long
and
my
social
pleasures
are
more
apt
to
add
to
my
efficiency
than
to
detract
from
with
this
violet
s
face
broke
into
a
smile
it
was
not
the
brilliant
one
so
often
seen
upon
her
lips
but
there
was
something
in
its
quality
which
carried
encouragement
to
the
widow
and
led
her
to
say
with
obvious
eagerness
you
know
the
facts
i
have
read
all
the
i
was
not
believed
on
the
it
was
your
manner
i
could
not
help
my
manner
i
was
keeping
something
back
and
being
unused
to
deceit
i
could
not
act
quite
why
did
you
keep
something
back
when
you
saw
the
unfavourable
impression
made
by
your
reticence
why
did
you
not
speak
up
and
frankly
tell
your
story
because
i
was
ashamed
because
i
thought
it
would
hurt
me
more
to
speak
than
to
keep
silent
i
do
not
think
so
now
but
i
did
then
and
so
made
my
great
mistake
you
must
remember
not
only
the
awful
shock
of
my
double
loss
but
the
sense
of
guilt
accompanying
it
for
my
husband
and
i
had
quarreled
that
night
quarreled
bitterly
that
was
why
i
had
run
away
into
another
room
and
not
because
i
was
feeling
ill
and
impatient
of
the
baby
s
fretful
so
people
have
in
saying
this
miss
strange
was
perhaps
cruelly
emphatic
you
wish
to
explain
that
quarrel
you
think
it
will
be
doing
any
good
to
your
cause
to
go
into
that
matter
with
me
now
i
can
not
say
but
i
must
first
clear
my
conscience
and
then
try
to
convince
you
that
quarrel
or
no
quarrel
he
never
took
his
own
life
he
was
not
that
kind
he
had
an
abnormal
fear
of
death
i
do
not
like
to
say
it
but
he
was
a
physical
coward
i
have
seen
him
turn
pale
at
the
least
hint
of
danger
he
could
no
more
have
turned
that
muzzle
upon
his
own
breast
than
he
could
have
turned
it
upon
his
baby
some
other
hand
shot
him
miss
strange
remember
the
open
window
the
shattered
mirror
and
i
think
i
know
that
her
head
had
fallen
forward
on
her
breast
the
emotion
she
showed
was
not
so
eloquent
of
grief
as
of
deep
personal
shame
you
think
you
know
the
man
in
saying
this
violet
s
voice
sunk
to
a
whisper
it
was
an
accusation
of
murder
she
had
just
heard
to
my
great
distress
yes
when
hammond
and
i
were
married
the
widow
now
proceeded
in
a
more
determined
tone
there
was
another
man
a
very
violent
one
who
vowed
even
at
the
church
door
that
george
and
i
should
never
live
out
two
full
years
together
we
have
not
our
second
anniversary
would
have
been
in
but
let
me
say
this
the
quarrel
of
which
i
speak
was
not
serious
enough
to
occasion
any
such
act
of
despair
on
his
part
a
man
would
be
mad
to
end
his
life
on
account
of
so
slight
a
disagreement
it
was
not
even
on
account
of
the
person
of
whom
i
ve
just
spoken
though
that
person
had
been
mentioned
between
us
earlier
in
the
evening
hammond
having
come
across
him
face
to
face
that
very
afternoon
in
the
subway
up
to
this
time
neither
of
us
had
seen
or
heard
of
him
since
our
and
you
think
this
person
whom
you
barely
mentioned
so
mindful
of
his
old
grudge
that
he
sought
out
your
domicile
and
with
the
intention
of
murder
climbed
the
trellis
leading
to
your
room
and
turned
his
pistol
upon
the
shadowy
figure
which
was
all
he
could
see
in
the
of
a
much
lowered
a
man
in
the
dark
does
not
need
a
bright
light
to
see
his
enemy
when
he
is
intent
upon
miss
strange
altered
her
tone
and
your
husband
you
must
acknowledge
that
he
shot
off
his
pistol
whether
the
other
did
or
it
was
in
he
would
shoot
to
save
his
own
life
or
the
baby
then
he
must
have
heard
or
seen
a
man
at
the
and
would
have
shot
there
or
tried
tried
to
yes
the
other
shot
first
oh
i
ve
thought
it
all
out
causing
my
husband
s
bullet
to
go
wild
it
was
his
which
broke
the
violet
s
eyes
bright
as
stars
suddenly
narrowed
and
what
happened
then
she
asked
why
can
not
they
find
the
bullet
because
it
went
out
of
the
window
glanced
off
and
went
out
of
the
hammond
s
tone
was
triumphant
her
look
spirited
and
intense
violet
eyed
her
compassionately
would
a
bullet
glancing
off
from
a
mirror
however
hung
be
apt
to
reach
a
window
so
far
on
the
opposite
side
i
don
t
know
i
only
know
that
it
did
was
the
contradictory
almost
absurd
reply
what
was
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
you
speak
of
between
your
husband
and
yourself
you
see
i
must
know
the
exact
truth
and
all
the
truth
to
be
of
any
assistance
to
it
was
it
was
about
the
care
i
gave
or
didn
t
give
the
baby
i
feel
awfully
to
have
to
say
it
but
george
did
not
think
i
did
my
full
duty
by
the
child
he
said
there
was
no
need
of
its
crying
so
that
if
i
gave
it
the
proper
attention
it
would
not
keep
the
neighbours
and
himself
awake
half
the
night
and
i
i
got
angry
and
insisted
that
i
did
the
best
i
could
that
the
child
was
naturally
fretful
and
that
if
he
wasn
t
satisfied
with
my
way
of
looking
after
it
he
might
try
his
all
of
which
was
very
wrong
and
unreasonable
on
my
part
as
witness
the
awful
punishment
which
and
what
made
you
get
up
and
leave
him
the
growl
he
gave
me
in
reply
when
i
heard
that
i
bounded
out
of
bed
and
said
i
was
going
to
the
spare
room
to
sleep
and
if
the
baby
cried
he
might
just
try
what
he
could
do
himself
to
stop
and
he
answered
this
just
this
i
shall
never
forget
his
words
as
long
as
i
live
if
you
go
you
need
not
expect
me
to
let
you
in
again
no
matter
what
he
said
that
and
locked
the
door
after
me
you
see
i
could
not
tell
all
it
might
have
been
better
if
you
had
it
was
such
a
natural
quarrel
and
so
unprovocative
of
actual
hammond
was
silent
it
was
not
difficult
to
see
that
she
had
no
very
keen
regrets
for
her
husband
personally
but
then
he
was
not
a
very
estimable
man
nor
in
any
respect
her
equal
you
were
not
happy
with
him
violet
ventured
to
remark
i
was
not
a
fully
contented
woman
but
for
all
that
he
had
no
cause
to
complain
of
me
except
for
the
reason
i
have
mentioned
i
was
not
a
very
intelligent
mother
but
if
the
baby
were
living
now
o
if
he
were
living
now
with
what
devotion
i
should
care
for
she
was
on
her
feet
her
arms
were
raised
her
face
impassioned
with
feeling
violet
gazing
at
her
heaved
a
little
sigh
it
was
perhaps
in
keeping
with
the
situation
perhaps
extraneous
to
it
but
whatever
its
source
it
marked
a
change
in
her
manner
with
no
further
check
upon
her
sympathy
she
said
very
softly
it
is
well
with
the
the
mother
stiffened
swayed
and
then
burst
into
wild
weeping
but
not
with
me
she
cried
not
with
me
i
am
desolate
and
bereft
i
have
not
even
a
home
in
which
to
hide
my
grief
and
no
prospect
of
but
interposed
violet
surely
your
husband
left
you
something
you
can
not
be
quite
penniless
my
husband
left
nothing
was
the
answer
uttered
without
bitterness
but
with
all
the
hardness
of
fact
he
had
debts
i
shall
pay
those
debts
when
these
and
other
necessary
expenses
are
liquidated
there
will
be
but
little
left
he
made
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
lived
close
up
to
his
means
that
is
why
he
was
induced
to
take
on
a
life
insurance
not
a
friend
of
his
but
knows
his
improvidence
i
i
have
not
even
jewels
i
have
only
my
determination
and
an
absolute
conviction
as
to
the
real
nature
of
my
husband
s
what
is
the
name
of
the
man
you
secretly
believe
to
have
shot
your
husband
from
the
trellis
hammond
told
her
it
was
a
new
one
to
violet
she
said
so
and
then
asked
what
else
can
you
tell
me
about
him
nothing
but
that
he
is
a
very
dark
man
and
has
a
oh
what
a
mistake
you
ve
mistake
yes
i
acknowledge
i
mean
in
not
giving
this
last
bit
of
information
at
once
to
the
police
a
man
can
be
identified
by
such
a
defect
even
his
footsteps
can
be
traced
he
might
have
been
found
that
very
day
now
what
have
we
to
go
upon
you
are
right
but
not
expecting
to
have
any
difficulty
about
the
insurance
money
i
thought
it
would
be
generous
in
me
to
keep
still
besides
this
is
only
surmise
on
my
part
i
feel
certain
that
my
husband
was
shot
by
another
hand
than
his
own
but
i
know
of
no
way
of
proving
it
do
you
then
violet
talked
seriously
with
her
explaining
how
their
only
hope
lay
in
the
discovery
of
a
second
bullet
in
the
room
which
had
already
been
ransacked
for
this
very
purpose
and
without
the
shadow
of
a
result
a
tea
a
musicale
and
an
evening
dance
kept
violet
strange
in
a
whirl
for
the
remainder
of
the
day
no
brighter
eye
nor
more
contagious
wit
lent
brilliance
to
these
occasions
but
with
the
passing
of
the
midnight
hour
no
one
who
had
seen
her
in
the
blaze
of
electric
lights
would
have
recognized
this
favoured
child
of
fortune
in
the
earnest
figure
sitting
in
the
obscurity
of
an
apartment
studying
the
walls
the
ceilings
and
the
floors
by
the
dim
light
of
a
lowered
violet
strange
in
society
was
a
very
different
person
from
violet
strange
under
the
tension
of
her
secret
and
peculiar
work
she
had
told
them
at
home
that
she
was
going
to
spend
the
night
with
a
friend
but
only
her
old
coachman
knew
who
that
friend
was
therefore
a
very
natural
sense
of
guilt
mingled
with
her
emotions
at
finding
herself
alone
on
a
scene
whose
gruesome
mystery
she
could
solve
only
by
identifying
herself
with
the
place
and
the
man
who
had
perished
there
dismissing
from
her
mind
all
thought
of
self
she
strove
to
think
as
he
thought
and
act
as
he
acted
on
the
night
when
he
found
himself
a
man
of
but
little
courage
left
in
this
room
with
an
ailing
child
at
odds
with
himself
his
wife
and
possibly
with
the
child
screaming
away
in
its
crib
what
would
he
be
apt
to
do
in
his
present
emergency
nothing
at
first
but
as
the
screaming
continued
he
would
remember
the
old
tales
of
fathers
walking
the
floor
at
night
with
crying
babies
and
hasten
to
follow
suit
violet
in
her
anxiety
to
reach
his
inmost
thought
crossed
to
where
the
crib
had
stood
and
taking
that
as
a
start
began
pacing
the
room
in
search
of
the
spot
from
which
a
bullet
if
shot
would
glance
aside
from
the
mirror
in
the
direction
of
the
window
not
that
she
was
ready
to
accept
this
theory
of
hammond
but
that
she
did
not
wish
to
entirely
dismiss
it
without
putting
it
to
the
test
she
found
it
in
an
unexpected
quarter
of
the
room
and
much
nearer
the
than
where
his
body
was
found
this
which
might
seem
to
confuse
matters
served
on
the
contrary
to
remove
from
the
case
one
of
its
most
serious
difficulties
standing
here
he
was
within
reach
of
the
pillow
under
which
his
pistol
lay
hidden
and
if
startled
as
his
wife
believed
him
to
have
been
by
a
noise
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
had
but
to
crouch
and
reach
behind
him
in
order
to
find
himself
armed
and
ready
for
a
possible
intruder
imitating
his
action
in
this
as
in
other
things
she
had
herself
crouched
low
at
the
bedside
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
her
hand
from
under
the
pillow
when
a
new
surprise
checked
her
movement
and
held
her
fixed
in
her
position
with
eyes
staring
straight
at
the
adjoining
wall
she
had
seen
there
what
he
must
have
seen
in
making
this
same
turn
the
dark
bars
of
the
opposite
outlined
in
the
mirror
and
understood
at
once
what
had
happened
in
the
nervousness
and
terror
of
the
moment
george
hammond
had
mistaken
this
reflection
of
the
window
for
the
window
itself
and
shot
impulsively
at
the
man
he
undoubtedly
saw
covering
him
from
the
trellis
without
but
while
this
explained
the
shattering
of
the
mirror
how
about
the
other
and
still
more
vital
question
of
where
the
bullet
went
afterward
was
the
angle
at
which
it
had
been
fired
acute
enough
to
send
it
out
of
a
window
diagonally
opposed
no
even
if
the
pistol
had
been
held
closer
to
the
man
firing
it
than
she
had
reason
to
believe
the
angle
still
would
be
oblique
enough
to
carry
it
on
to
the
further
wall
but
no
sign
of
any
such
impact
had
been
discovered
on
this
wall
consequently
the
force
of
the
bullet
had
been
expended
before
reaching
it
and
when
it
fell
here
her
glance
slowly
traveling
along
the
floor
impetuously
paused
it
had
reached
the
spot
where
the
two
bodies
had
been
found
and
unconsciously
her
eyes
rested
there
conjuring
up
the
picture
of
the
bleeding
father
and
the
strangled
child
how
piteous
and
how
dreadful
it
all
was
if
she
could
only
understand
suddenly
she
rose
straight
up
staring
and
immovable
in
the
dim
light
had
the
idea
the
explanation
the
only
possible
explanation
covering
the
whole
phenomena
come
to
her
at
last
it
would
seem
so
for
as
she
so
stood
a
look
of
conviction
settled
over
her
features
and
with
this
look
evidences
of
a
horror
which
for
all
her
fast
accumulating
knowledge
of
life
and
its
possibilities
made
her
appear
very
small
and
very
helpless
a
later
when
hammond
in
her
anxiety
at
hearing
nothing
more
from
miss
strange
opened
the
door
of
her
room
it
was
to
find
lying
on
the
edge
of
the
sill
the
little
detective
s
card
with
these
words
hastily
written
across
it
i
do
not
feel
as
well
as
i
could
wish
and
so
have
telephoned
to
my
own
coachman
to
come
and
take
me
home
i
will
either
see
or
write
you
within
a
few
days
but
do
not
allow
yourself
to
hope
i
pray
you
do
not
allow
yourself
the
least
hope
the
outcome
is
still
very
problematical
when
violet
s
employer
entered
his
office
the
next
morning
it
was
to
find
a
veiled
figure
awaiting
him
which
he
at
once
recognized
as
that
of
his
little
deputy
she
was
slow
in
lifting
her
veil
and
when
it
finally
came
free
he
felt
a
momentary
doubt
as
to
his
wisdom
in
giving
her
just
such
a
matter
as
this
to
investigate
he
was
quite
sure
of
his
mistake
when
he
saw
her
face
it
was
so
drawn
and
pitiful
you
have
failed
said
he
of
that
you
must
judge
she
answered
and
drawing
near
she
whispered
in
his
ear
no
he
cried
in
his
amazement
think
she
murmured
think
only
so
can
all
the
facts
be
accounted
i
will
look
into
it
i
will
certainly
look
into
it
was
his
earnest
reply
if
you
are
right
but
never
mind
that
go
home
and
take
a
horseback
ride
in
the
park
when
i
have
news
in
regard
to
this
i
will
let
you
know
till
then
forget
it
all
hear
me
i
charge
you
to
forget
everything
but
your
balls
and
your
and
violet
obeyed
him
some
few
days
after
this
the
following
statement
appeared
in
all
the
papers
owing
to
some
remarkable
work
done
by
the
firm
of
the
private
detective
agency
the
claim
made
by
george
hammond
against
the
shuler
life
insurance
company
is
likely
to
be
allowed
without
further
litigation
as
our
readers
will
remember
the
contestant
has
insisted
from
the
first
that
the
bullet
causing
her
husband
s
death
came
from
another
pistol
than
the
one
found
clutched
in
his
own
hand
but
while
reasons
were
not
lacking
to
substantiate
this
assertion
the
failure
to
discover
more
than
the
disputed
track
of
a
second
bullet
led
to
a
verdict
of
suicide
and
a
refusal
of
the
company
to
pay
but
now
that
bullet
has
been
found
and
where
in
the
most
startling
place
in
the
world
viz
in
the
larynx
of
the
child
found
lying
dead
upon
the
floor
beside
his
father
strangled
as
was
supposed
by
the
weight
of
that
father
s
arm
the
theory
is
and
there
seems
to
be
none
other
that
the
father
hearing
a
suspicious
noise
at
the
window
set
down
the
child
he
was
endeavouring
to
soothe
and
made
for
the
bed
and
his
own
pistol
and
mistaking
a
reflection
of
the
assassin
for
the
assassin
himself
sent
his
shot
sidewise
at
a
mirror
just
as
the
other
let
go
the
trigger
which
drove
a
similar
bullet
into
his
breast
the
course
of
the
one
was
straight
and
fatal
and
that
of
the
other
deflected
striking
the
mirror
at
an
oblique
angle
the
bullet
fell
to
the
floor
where
it
was
picked
up
by
the
crawling
child
and
as
was
most
natural
thrust
at
once
into
his
mouth
perhaps
it
felt
hot
to
the
little
tongue
perhaps
the
child
was
simply
frightened
by
some
convulsive
movement
of
the
father
who
evidently
spent
his
last
moment
in
an
endeavour
to
reach
the
child
but
whatever
the
cause
in
the
quick
gasp
it
gave
the
bullet
was
drawn
into
the
larynx
strangling
him
that
the
father
s
arm
in
his
last
struggle
should
have
fallen
directly
across
the
little
throat
is
one
of
those
anomalies
which
confounds
reason
and
misleads
justice
by
stopping
investigation
at
the
very
point
where
truth
lies
and
mystery
disappears
mrs
hammond
is
to
be
congratulated
that
there
are
detectives
who
do
not
give
too
much
credence
to
outward
we
expect
soon
to
hear
of
the
capture
of
the
man
who
sped
home
the
bullet
end
of
problem
ii
problem
iii
an
intangible
clue
have
you
studied
the
case
not
not
studied
the
case
which
for
the
last
few
days
has
provided
the
papers
with
such
conspicuous
headlines
i
do
not
read
the
papers
i
have
not
looked
at
one
in
a
whole
miss
strange
your
social
engagements
must
be
of
a
very
pressing
nature
just
now
they
and
your
business
sense
in
abeyance
how
so
you
would
not
ask
if
you
had
read
the
to
this
she
made
no
reply
save
by
a
slight
toss
of
her
pretty
head
if
her
employer
felt
nettled
by
this
show
of
indifference
he
did
not
betray
it
save
by
the
rapidity
of
his
tones
as
without
further
preamble
and
possibly
without
real
excuse
he
proceeded
to
lay
before
her
the
case
in
question
last
tuesday
night
a
woman
was
murdered
in
this
city
an
old
woman
in
a
lonely
house
where
she
has
lived
for
years
perhaps
you
remember
this
house
it
occupies
a
not
inconspicuous
site
in
seventeenth
street
a
house
of
the
olden
time
no
i
do
not
the
extreme
carelessness
of
miss
strange
s
tone
would
have
been
fatal
to
her
socially
but
then
she
would
never
have
used
it
socially
this
they
both
knew
yet
he
smiled
with
his
customary
indulgence
then
i
will
describe
she
looked
around
for
a
chair
and
sank
into
it
he
did
the
same
it
has
a
fanlight
over
the
front
she
remained
impassive
and
two
strips
of
glass
on
either
and
a
knocker
between
its
panels
which
may
bring
money
some
oh
you
do
remember
i
thought
you
would
miss
yes
fanlights
over
doors
are
becoming
very
rare
in
new
very
well
then
that
house
was
the
scene
of
tuesday
s
tragedy
the
woman
who
has
lived
there
in
solitude
for
years
was
foully
murdered
i
have
since
heard
that
the
people
who
knew
her
best
have
always
anticipated
some
such
violent
end
for
her
she
never
allowed
maid
or
friend
to
remain
with
her
after
five
in
the
afternoon
yet
she
had
money
some
think
a
great
deal
always
in
the
i
am
interested
in
the
house
not
in
yet
she
was
a
character
as
full
of
whims
and
crotchets
as
a
nut
is
of
meat
her
death
was
horrible
she
fought
her
dress
was
torn
from
her
body
in
rags
this
happened
you
see
before
her
hour
for
retiring
some
think
as
early
as
six
in
the
afternoon
and
here
he
made
a
rapid
gesture
to
catch
violet
s
wandering
attention
in
spite
of
this
struggle
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
dragged
from
room
to
room
that
her
person
was
searched
and
everything
in
the
house
searched
that
drawers
were
pulled
out
of
bureaus
doors
wrenched
off
of
cupboards
china
smashed
upon
the
floor
whole
shelves
denuded
and
not
a
spot
from
cellar
to
garret
left
unransacked
no
direct
clue
to
the
perpetrator
has
been
found
nothing
that
gives
any
idea
of
his
personality
save
his
display
of
strength
and
great
cupidity
the
police
have
even
deigned
to
consult
me
an
unusual
procedure
but
i
could
find
nothing
either
evidences
of
fiendish
purpose
abound
of
relentless
search
but
no
clue
to
the
man
himself
it
s
uncommon
isn
t
it
not
to
have
any
clue
i
suppose
miss
strange
hated
murders
and
it
was
with
difficulty
she
could
be
brought
to
discuss
them
but
she
was
not
going
to
be
let
off
not
this
time
you
see
he
proceeded
insistently
it
s
not
only
mortifying
to
the
police
but
disappointing
to
the
press
especially
as
few
reporters
believe
in
the
business
they
say
and
we
can
not
but
agree
with
them
that
no
such
struggle
could
take
place
and
no
such
repeated
goings
to
and
fro
through
the
house
without
some
vestige
being
left
by
which
to
connect
this
crime
with
its
daring
still
she
stared
down
at
her
hands
those
little
hands
so
white
and
fluttering
so
seemingly
helpless
under
the
weight
of
their
many
rings
and
yet
so
slyly
capable
she
must
have
queer
neighbours
came
at
last
from
miss
strange
s
reluctant
lips
didn
t
they
hear
or
see
anything
of
all
this
she
has
no
neighbours
that
is
after
five
o
clock
there
s
a
printing
establishment
on
one
side
of
her
a
deserted
mansion
on
the
other
side
and
nothing
but
warehouses
back
and
front
there
was
no
one
to
notice
what
took
place
in
her
small
dwelling
after
the
printing
house
was
closed
she
was
the
most
courageous
or
the
most
foolish
of
women
to
remain
there
as
she
did
but
nothing
except
death
could
budge
her
she
was
born
in
the
room
where
she
died
was
married
in
the
one
where
she
worked
saw
husband
father
mother
and
five
sisters
carried
out
in
turn
to
their
graves
through
the
door
with
the
fanlight
over
the
top
and
these
memories
held
you
are
trying
to
interest
me
in
the
woman
don
no
i
m
not
trying
to
interest
you
in
her
only
trying
to
explain
her
there
was
another
reason
for
her
remaining
where
she
did
so
long
after
all
residents
had
left
the
block
she
had
a
oh
she
embroidered
monograms
for
fine
she
did
but
you
needn
t
look
at
me
like
that
she
never
embroidered
any
for
no
she
did
work
i
saw
some
of
it
miss
strange
if
i
could
get
you
into
that
house
for
ten
minutes
not
to
see
her
but
to
pick
up
the
loose
intangible
thread
which
i
am
sure
is
floating
around
in
it
somewhere
wouldn
t
you
go
violet
slowly
rose
a
movement
which
he
followed
to
the
letter
must
i
express
in
words
the
limit
i
have
set
for
myself
in
our
affair
she
asked
when
for
reasons
i
have
never
thought
myself
called
upon
to
explain
i
consented
to
help
you
a
little
now
and
then
with
some
matter
where
a
woman
s
tact
and
knowledge
of
the
social
world
might
tell
without
offence
to
herself
or
others
i
never
thought
it
would
be
necessary
for
me
to
state
that
temptation
must
stop
with
such
cases
or
that
i
should
not
be
asked
to
touch
the
sordid
or
the
bloody
but
it
seems
i
was
mistaken
and
that
i
must
stoop
to
be
explicit
the
woman
who
was
killed
on
tuesday
might
have
interested
me
greatly
as
an
embroiderer
but
as
a
victim
not
at
all
what
do
you
see
in
me
or
miss
in
me
that
you
should
drag
me
into
an
atmosphere
of
crime
nothing
miss
strange
you
are
by
nature
as
well
as
by
breeding
very
far
removed
from
everything
of
the
kind
but
you
will
allow
me
to
suggest
that
no
crime
is
which
makes
imperative
demand
upon
the
intellect
and
intuitive
sense
of
its
investigator
only
the
most
delicate
touch
can
feel
and
hold
the
thread
i
ve
just
spoken
of
and
you
have
the
most
delicate
touch
i
do
not
attempt
to
flatter
me
i
have
no
fancy
for
handling
befouled
spider
webs
besides
if
i
had
if
such
elusive
filaments
fascinated
me
how
could
i
in
person
and
name
enter
upon
such
a
scene
without
prejudice
to
our
mutual
compact
miss
strange
she
had
reseated
herself
but
so
far
he
had
failed
to
follow
her
example
an
ignoring
of
the
subtle
hint
that
her
interest
might
yet
be
caught
which
seemed
to
annoy
her
a
trifle
i
should
not
even
have
suggested
such
a
possibility
had
i
not
seen
a
way
of
introducing
you
there
without
risk
to
your
position
or
mine
among
the
boxes
piled
upon
doolittle
s
table
boxes
of
finished
work
most
of
them
addressed
and
ready
for
delivery
was
one
on
which
could
be
seen
the
name
of
shall
i
mention
it
not
mine
you
don
t
mean
mine
that
would
be
too
odd
too
ridiculously
odd
i
should
not
understand
a
coincidence
of
that
kind
no
i
should
not
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
i
have
lately
sent
out
such
work
to
be
yet
it
was
your
name
very
clearly
and
precisely
written
your
whole
name
miss
strange
i
saw
and
read
it
but
i
gave
the
order
to
madame
pirot
on
fifth
avenue
how
came
my
things
to
be
found
in
the
house
of
this
woman
of
whose
horrible
death
we
have
been
talking
did
you
suppose
that
madame
pirot
did
such
work
with
her
own
hands
or
even
had
it
done
in
her
own
establishment
doolittle
was
universally
employed
she
worked
for
a
dozen
firms
you
will
find
the
biggest
names
on
most
of
her
packages
but
on
this
one
i
allude
to
the
one
addressed
to
you
there
was
more
to
be
seen
than
the
name
these
words
were
written
on
it
in
another
hand
send
without
opening
this
struck
the
police
as
suspicious
sufficiently
so
at
least
for
them
to
desire
your
presence
at
the
house
as
soon
as
you
can
make
it
to
open
the
box
the
curl
of
miss
strange
s
disdainful
lip
was
a
sight
to
see
you
wrote
those
words
yourself
she
coolly
observed
while
someone
s
back
was
turned
you
whipped
out
your
pencil
and
resorted
to
a
very
pardonable
subterfuge
highly
conducive
to
the
public
s
good
but
never
mind
that
will
you
go
miss
strange
became
suddenly
demure
i
suppose
i
must
she
grudgingly
conceded
however
obtained
a
summons
from
the
police
can
not
be
ignored
even
by
peter
strange
s
another
man
might
have
displayed
his
triumph
by
smile
or
gesture
but
this
one
had
learned
his
role
too
well
he
simply
said
very
good
shall
it
be
at
once
i
have
a
taxi
at
the
but
she
failed
to
see
the
necessity
of
any
such
hurry
with
sudden
dignity
she
replied
that
won
t
do
if
i
go
to
this
house
it
must
be
under
suitable
conditions
i
shall
have
to
ask
my
brother
to
accompany
your
brother
oh
he
s
safe
he
he
your
brother
knows
her
visitor
with
less
control
than
usual
betrayed
very
openly
his
uneasiness
he
does
and
approves
but
that
s
not
what
interests
us
now
only
so
far
as
it
makes
it
possible
for
me
to
go
with
propriety
to
that
dreadful
a
formal
bow
from
the
other
and
the
words
they
may
expect
you
then
can
you
say
when
within
the
next
hour
but
it
will
be
a
useless
concession
on
my
part
she
pettishly
complained
a
place
that
has
been
gone
over
by
a
dozen
detectives
is
apt
to
be
brushed
clean
of
its
cobwebs
even
if
such
ever
that
s
the
difficulty
he
acknowledged
and
did
not
dare
to
add
another
word
she
was
at
that
particular
moment
so
very
much
the
great
lady
and
so
little
his
confidential
agent
he
might
have
been
less
impressed
however
by
this
sudden
assumption
of
manner
had
he
been
so
fortunate
as
to
have
seen
how
she
employed
the
three
quarters
of
an
hour
s
delay
for
which
she
had
asked
she
read
those
neglected
newspapers
especially
the
one
containing
the
following
highly
coloured
narration
of
this
ghastly
crime
a
door
ajar
an
empty
hall
a
line
of
sinister
looking
blotches
marking
a
guilty
step
diagonally
across
the
flagging
silence
and
an
unmistakable
odour
repugnant
to
all
humanity
such
were
the
indications
which
met
the
eyes
of
officer
o
leary
on
his
first
round
last
night
and
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
murder
which
will
long
thrill
the
city
by
its
mystery
and
horror
both
the
house
and
the
victim
are
well
here
followed
a
description
of
the
same
and
of
doolittle
s
manner
of
life
in
her
ancient
home
which
violet
hurriedly
passed
over
to
come
to
the
following
as
far
as
one
can
judge
from
appearances
the
crime
happened
in
this
wise
doolittle
had
been
in
her
kitchen
as
the
found
singing
on
the
stove
goes
to
prove
and
was
coming
back
through
her
bedroom
when
the
wretch
who
had
stolen
in
by
the
front
door
which
to
save
steps
she
was
unfortunately
in
the
habit
of
leaving
on
the
latch
till
all
possibility
of
customers
for
the
day
was
over
sprang
upon
her
from
behind
and
dealt
her
a
swinging
blow
with
the
poker
he
had
caught
up
from
the
hearthstone
whether
the
struggle
which
ensued
followed
immediately
upon
this
first
attack
or
came
later
it
will
take
medical
experts
to
determine
but
whenever
it
did
occur
the
fierceness
of
its
character
is
shown
by
the
grip
taken
upon
her
throat
and
the
traces
of
blood
which
are
to
be
seen
all
over
the
house
if
the
wretch
had
lugged
her
into
her
workroom
and
thence
to
the
kitchen
and
thence
back
to
the
spot
of
first
assault
the
evidences
could
not
have
been
more
ghastly
bits
of
her
clothing
torn
off
by
a
ruthless
hand
lay
scattered
over
all
these
floors
in
her
bedroom
where
she
finally
breathed
her
last
there
could
be
seen
mingled
with
these
a
number
of
large
but
worthless
glass
beads
and
close
against
one
of
the
the
string
which
had
held
them
as
shown
by
the
few
remaining
beads
still
clinging
to
it
if
in
pulling
the
string
from
her
neck
he
had
hoped
to
light
upon
some
valuable
booty
his
fury
at
his
disappointment
is
evident
you
can
almost
see
the
frenzy
with
which
he
flung
the
necklace
at
the
wall
and
kicked
about
and
stamped
upon
its
rapidly
rolling
beads
booty
that
was
what
he
was
after
to
find
and
carry
away
the
poor
needlewoman
s
supposed
hoardings
if
the
scene
baffles
description
if
as
some
believe
he
dragged
her
yet
living
from
spot
to
spot
demanding
information
as
to
her
places
of
concealment
under
threat
of
repeated
blows
and
finally
baffled
dealt
the
finishing
stroke
and
proceeded
on
the
search
alone
no
greater
devastation
could
have
taken
place
in
this
poor
woman
s
house
or
effects
yet
such
was
his
precaution
and
care
for
himself
that
he
left
no
behind
him
nor
any
other
token
which
could
lead
to
personal
identification
even
though
his
footsteps
could
be
traced
in
much
the
order
i
have
mentioned
they
were
of
so
indeterminate
and
shapeless
a
character
as
to
convey
little
to
the
intelligence
of
the
investigator
that
these
smears
they
could
not
be
called
footprints
not
only
crossed
the
hall
but
appeared
in
more
than
one
place
on
the
staircase
proves
that
he
did
not
confine
his
search
to
the
lower
storey
and
perhaps
one
of
the
most
interesting
features
of
the
case
lies
in
the
indications
given
by
these
marks
of
the
raging
course
he
took
through
these
upper
rooms
as
the
accompanying
diagram
will
show
we
omit
the
diagram
he
went
first
into
the
large
front
chamber
thence
to
the
rear
where
we
find
two
rooms
one
unfinished
and
filled
with
accumulated
stuff
most
of
which
he
left
lying
loose
upon
the
floor
and
the
other
plastered
and
containing
a
window
opening
upon
an
at
the
side
but
empty
of
all
furniture
and
without
even
a
carpet
on
the
bare
boards
why
he
should
have
entered
the
latter
place
and
why
having
entered
he
should
have
crossed
to
the
window
will
be
plain
to
those
who
have
studied
the
conditions
the
front
chamber
windows
were
tightly
shuttered
the
attic
ones
cumbered
with
boxes
and
shielded
from
approach
by
old
bureaus
and
discarded
chairs
this
one
only
was
free
and
although
darkened
by
the
proximity
of
the
house
neighbouring
it
across
the
alley
was
the
only
spot
on
the
storey
where
sufficient
light
could
be
had
at
this
late
hour
for
the
examination
of
any
object
of
whose
value
he
was
doubtful
that
he
had
come
across
such
an
object
and
had
brought
it
to
this
window
for
some
such
purpose
is
very
satisfactorily
demonstrated
by
the
discovery
of
a
worn
out
wallet
of
ancient
make
lying
on
the
floor
directly
in
front
of
this
window
a
proof
of
his
cupidity
but
also
proof
of
his
for
this
wallet
when
lifted
and
opened
was
found
to
contain
two
hundred
or
more
dollars
in
old
bills
which
if
not
the
full
hoard
of
their
industrious
owner
was
certainly
worth
the
taking
by
one
who
had
risked
his
neck
for
the
sole
purpose
of
theft
this
wallet
and
the
flight
of
the
murderer
without
it
give
to
this
affair
otherwise
simply
brutal
a
dramatic
interest
which
will
be
appreciated
not
only
by
the
very
able
detectives
already
hot
upon
the
chase
but
by
all
other
inquiring
minds
anxious
to
solve
a
mystery
of
which
so
estimable
a
woman
has
been
the
unfortunate
victim
a
problem
is
presented
to
the
police
there
violet
stopped
when
not
long
after
the
superb
limousine
of
peter
strange
stopped
before
the
little
house
in
seventeenth
street
it
caused
a
veritable
sensation
not
only
in
the
lingering
on
the
sidewalk
but
to
the
two
persons
within
the
officer
on
guard
and
a
belated
reporter
though
dressed
in
her
plainest
suit
violet
strange
looked
much
too
fashionable
and
far
too
young
and
thoughtless
to
be
observed
without
emotion
entering
a
scene
of
hideous
and
brutal
crime
even
the
young
man
who
accompanied
her
promised
to
bring
a
most
incongruous
element
into
this
atmosphere
of
guilt
and
horror
and
as
the
detective
on
guard
whispered
to
the
man
beside
him
might
much
better
have
been
left
behind
in
the
car
but
violet
was
great
for
the
proprieties
and
young
arthur
followed
her
in
her
entrance
was
a
coup
du
theatre
she
had
lifted
her
veil
in
crossing
the
sidewalk
and
her
interesting
features
and
general
air
of
timidity
were
very
fetching
as
the
man
holding
open
the
door
noted
the
impression
made
upon
his
companion
he
muttered
with
sly
facetiousness
you
think
you
ll
show
her
nothing
but
i
m
ready
to
bet
a
fiver
that
she
ll
want
to
see
it
all
and
that
you
ll
show
it
to
the
detective
s
grin
was
expressive
notwithstanding
the
shrug
with
which
he
tried
to
carry
it
off
and
violet
the
hall
into
which
she
now
stepped
from
the
most
vivid
sunlight
had
never
been
considered
even
in
its
palmiest
days
as
possessing
cheer
even
of
the
stately
kind
the
ghastly
green
light
infused
through
it
by
the
coloured
glass
on
either
side
of
the
doorway
seemed
to
promise
yet
more
dismal
things
beyond
must
i
go
in
there
she
asked
pointing
with
an
admirable
simulation
of
nervous
excitement
to
a
door
at
her
left
is
there
where
it
happened
arthur
do
you
suppose
that
there
is
where
it
happened
no
no
miss
the
officer
made
haste
to
assure
her
if
you
are
miss
strange
violet
bowed
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
woman
was
struck
in
her
bedroom
the
door
beside
you
leads
into
the
parlour
or
as
she
would
have
called
it
her
you
needn
t
be
afraid
of
going
in
there
you
will
see
nothing
but
the
disorder
of
her
boxes
they
were
pretty
well
pulled
about
not
all
of
them
though
he
added
watching
her
as
closely
as
the
dim
light
permitted
there
is
one
which
gives
no
sign
of
having
been
tampered
with
it
was
done
up
in
wrapping
paper
and
is
addressed
to
you
which
in
itself
would
not
have
seemed
worthy
of
our
attention
had
not
these
lines
been
scribbled
on
it
in
a
man
s
handwriting
send
without
how
odd
exclaimed
the
little
minx
with
widely
opened
eyes
and
an
air
of
guileless
innocence
whatever
can
it
mean
nothing
serious
i
am
sure
for
the
woman
did
not
even
know
me
she
was
employed
to
do
this
work
by
madame
didn
t
you
know
that
it
was
to
be
done
here
no
i
thought
madame
pirot
s
own
girls
did
her
embroidery
for
so
that
you
were
surprised
wasn
t
i
to
get
our
i
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
the
earnest
look
with
which
she
uttered
this
disclaimer
did
its
appointed
work
the
detective
accepted
her
for
what
she
seemed
and
oblivious
to
the
reporter
s
satirical
gesture
crossed
to
the
door
which
he
threw
wide
open
with
the
remark
i
should
be
glad
to
have
you
open
that
box
in
our
presence
it
is
undoubtedly
all
right
but
we
wish
to
be
sure
you
know
what
the
box
should
contain
oh
yes
indeed
and
sheets
with
a
big
s
embroidered
on
very
well
shall
i
undo
the
string
for
you
i
shall
be
much
obliged
said
she
her
eye
flashing
quickly
about
the
room
before
settling
down
upon
the
knot
he
was
deftly
loosening
her
brother
gazing
indifferently
in
from
the
doorway
hardly
noticed
this
look
but
the
reporter
at
his
back
did
though
he
failed
to
detect
its
penetrating
quality
your
name
is
on
the
other
side
observed
the
detective
as
he
drew
away
the
string
and
turned
the
package
over
the
smile
which
just
lifted
the
corner
of
her
lips
was
not
in
answer
to
this
remark
but
to
her
recognition
of
her
employer
s
handwriting
in
the
words
under
her
name
send
without
opening
she
had
not
misjudged
him
the
cover
you
may
like
to
take
off
yourself
suggested
the
officer
as
he
lifted
the
box
out
of
its
wrapper
oh
i
don
t
mind
there
s
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
embroidered
linen
or
perhaps
that
is
not
what
you
are
looking
for
no
one
answered
all
were
busy
watching
her
whip
off
the
lid
and
lift
out
the
pile
of
sheets
and
with
which
the
box
was
closely
packed
shall
i
unfold
them
she
asked
the
detective
nodded
taking
out
the
topmost
sheet
she
shook
it
open
then
the
next
and
the
next
till
she
reached
the
bottom
of
the
box
nothing
of
a
criminating
nature
came
to
light
the
box
as
well
as
its
contents
was
without
mystery
of
any
kind
this
was
not
an
unexpected
result
of
course
but
the
smile
with
which
she
began
to
refold
the
pieces
and
throw
them
back
into
the
box
revealed
one
of
her
dimples
which
was
almost
as
dangerous
to
the
casual
observer
as
when
it
revealed
both
there
she
exclaimed
you
see
household
linen
exactly
as
i
said
now
may
i
go
home
certainly
miss
the
detective
stole
a
sly
glance
at
the
reporter
she
was
not
going
in
for
the
horrors
then
after
all
but
the
reporter
abated
nothing
of
his
knowing
air
for
while
she
spoke
of
going
she
made
no
move
towards
doing
so
but
continued
to
look
about
the
room
till
her
glances
finally
settled
on
a
long
dark
curtain
shutting
off
an
adjoining
room
there
s
where
she
lies
i
suppose
she
feelingly
exclaimed
and
not
one
of
you
knows
who
killed
her
somehow
i
can
not
understand
that
why
don
t
you
know
when
that
s
what
you
re
hired
for
the
innocence
with
which
she
uttered
this
was
astonishing
the
detective
began
to
look
sheepish
and
the
reporter
turned
aside
to
hide
his
smile
whether
in
another
moment
either
would
have
spoken
no
one
can
say
for
with
a
mock
consciousness
of
having
said
something
foolish
she
caught
up
her
parasol
from
the
table
and
made
a
start
for
the
door
but
of
course
she
looked
back
i
was
wondering
she
recommenced
with
a
half
wistful
half
speculative
air
whether
i
should
ask
to
have
a
peep
at
the
place
where
it
all
the
reporter
chuckled
behind
the
he
was
chewing
but
the
officer
maintained
his
solemn
air
for
which
act
of
he
was
undoubtedly
grateful
when
in
another
minute
she
gave
a
quick
impulsive
shudder
not
altogether
assumed
and
vehemently
added
but
i
couldn
t
stand
the
sight
no
i
couldn
t
i
m
an
awful
coward
when
it
comes
to
things
like
that
nothing
in
all
the
world
would
induce
me
to
look
at
the
woman
or
her
room
but
i
should
like
here
both
her
dimples
came
into
play
though
she
could
not
be
said
exactly
to
smile
just
one
little
look
upstairs
where
he
went
poking
about
so
long
without
any
fear
it
seems
of
being
interrupted
ever
since
i
ve
read
about
it
i
have
seen
in
my
mind
a
picture
of
his
wicked
figure
sneaking
from
room
to
room
tearing
open
drawers
and
flinging
out
the
contents
of
closets
just
to
find
a
little
money
a
little
little
money
i
shall
not
sleep
just
for
wondering
how
those
high
up
attic
rooms
really
who
could
dream
that
back
of
this
display
of
mingled
childishness
and
audacity
there
lay
hidden
purpose
intellect
and
a
keen
knowledge
of
human
nature
not
the
two
men
who
listened
to
this
seemingly
irresponsible
chatter
to
them
she
was
a
child
to
be
humoured
and
humour
her
they
did
the
dainty
feet
which
had
already
found
their
way
to
that
gloomy
staircase
were
allowed
to
ascend
followed
it
is
true
by
those
of
the
officer
who
did
not
dare
to
smile
back
at
the
reporter
because
of
the
brother
s
watchful
and
none
too
conciliatory
eye
at
the
stair
head
she
paused
to
look
back
i
don
t
see
those
horrible
marks
which
the
papers
describe
as
running
all
along
the
lower
hall
and
up
these
no
miss
strange
they
have
gradually
been
rubbed
out
but
you
will
find
some
still
showing
on
these
upper
oh
oh
where
you
frighten
me
frighten
me
horribly
but
but
if
you
don
t
mind
i
should
like
to
why
should
not
a
man
on
a
tedious
job
amuse
himself
piloting
her
over
to
the
small
room
in
the
rear
he
pointed
down
at
the
boards
she
gave
one
look
and
then
stepped
gingerly
in
just
look
she
cried
a
whole
string
of
marks
going
straight
from
door
to
window
they
have
no
shape
have
they
just
blotches
i
wonder
why
one
of
them
is
so
much
larger
than
the
rest
this
was
no
new
question
it
was
one
which
everybody
who
went
into
the
room
was
sure
to
ask
there
was
such
a
difference
in
the
size
and
appearance
of
the
mark
nearest
the
window
the
reason
well
minds
were
divided
about
that
and
no
one
had
a
satisfactory
theory
the
detective
therefore
kept
discreetly
silent
this
did
not
seem
to
offend
miss
strange
on
the
contrary
it
gave
her
an
opportunity
to
babble
away
to
her
heart
s
content
one
two
three
four
five
six
she
counted
with
a
shudder
at
every
count
and
one
of
them
bigger
than
the
she
might
have
added
it
is
the
trail
of
one
foot
and
strangely
intermingled
at
that
but
she
did
not
though
we
may
be
quite
sure
that
she
noted
the
fact
and
where
just
where
did
the
old
wallet
fall
here
or
here
she
had
moved
as
she
spoke
so
that
in
uttering
the
last
here
she
stood
directly
before
the
window
the
surprise
she
received
there
nearly
made
her
forget
the
part
she
was
playing
from
the
character
of
the
light
in
the
room
she
had
expected
on
looking
out
to
confront
a
wall
but
not
a
window
in
that
wall
yet
that
was
what
she
saw
directly
facing
her
from
across
the
alley
separating
this
house
from
its
neighbour
twelve
unshuttered
and
uncurtained
panes
through
which
she
caught
a
darkened
view
of
a
room
almost
as
forlorn
and
devoid
of
furniture
as
the
one
in
which
she
then
stood
when
quite
sure
of
herself
she
let
a
certain
portion
of
her
surprise
appear
why
look
she
cried
if
you
can
t
see
right
in
next
door
what
a
place
from
its
desolate
appearance
i
should
think
the
house
quite
and
it
is
that
s
the
old
shaffer
homestead
it
s
been
empty
for
a
oh
empty
and
she
turned
away
with
the
most
inconsequent
air
in
the
world
crying
out
as
her
name
rang
up
the
stair
there
s
arthur
calling
i
suppose
he
thinks
i
ve
been
here
long
enough
i
m
sure
i
m
very
much
obliged
to
you
officer
i
really
shouldn
t
have
slept
a
wink
if
i
hadn
t
been
given
a
peep
at
these
rooms
which
i
had
imagined
so
and
with
one
additional
glance
over
her
shoulder
that
seemed
to
penetrate
both
windows
and
the
desolate
space
beyond
she
ran
quickly
out
and
down
in
response
to
her
brother
s
reiterated
call
drive
quickly
as
quickly
as
the
law
allows
to
hiram
brown
s
office
in
duane
arrived
at
the
address
named
she
went
in
alone
to
see
brown
he
was
her
father
s
lawyer
and
a
family
friend
hardly
waiting
for
his
affectionate
greeting
she
cried
out
quickly
tell
me
how
i
can
learn
anything
about
the
old
shaffer
house
in
seventeenth
street
now
don
t
look
so
surprised
i
have
very
good
reasons
for
my
request
and
and
i
m
in
an
awful
but
i
know
i
know
there
s
been
a
dreadful
tragedy
next
door
to
it
but
it
s
about
the
shaffer
house
itself
i
want
some
information
has
it
an
agent
a
of
course
it
has
an
agent
and
here
is
his
brown
presented
her
with
a
card
on
which
he
had
hastily
written
both
name
and
address
she
thanked
him
dropped
him
a
mocking
curtsey
full
of
charm
whispered
don
t
tell
father
and
was
gone
her
manner
to
the
man
she
next
interviewed
was
very
different
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
subsided
into
her
usual
society
manner
with
just
a
touch
of
the
conceit
of
the
successful
debutante
she
announced
herself
as
miss
strange
of
street
her
business
with
him
was
in
regard
to
the
possible
renting
of
the
shaffer
house
she
had
an
old
lady
friend
who
was
desirous
of
living
downtown
in
passing
through
seventeenth
street
she
had
noticed
that
the
old
shaffer
house
was
standing
empty
and
had
been
immediately
struck
with
the
advantages
it
possessed
for
her
elderly
friend
s
occupancy
could
it
be
that
the
house
was
for
rent
there
was
no
sign
on
it
to
that
effect
but
etc
his
answer
left
her
nothing
to
hope
for
it
is
going
to
be
torn
down
he
said
oh
what
a
pity
she
exclaimed
real
colonial
isn
t
it
i
wish
i
could
see
the
rooms
inside
before
it
is
disturbed
such
doors
and
such
dear
mantelpieces
as
it
must
have
i
just
dote
on
the
colonial
it
brings
up
such
pictures
of
the
old
days
weddings
you
know
and
parties
all
so
different
from
ours
and
so
much
more
is
it
the
chance
shot
that
tells
sometimes
violet
had
no
especial
intention
in
what
she
said
save
as
a
prelude
to
a
pending
request
but
nothing
could
have
served
her
purpose
better
than
that
one
word
wedding
the
agent
laughed
and
giving
her
his
first
indulgent
look
remarked
genially
romance
is
not
confined
to
those
ancient
times
if
you
were
to
enter
that
house
you
would
come
across
evidences
of
a
wedding
as
romantic
as
any
which
ever
took
place
in
all
the
seventy
odd
years
of
its
existence
a
man
and
a
woman
were
married
there
day
before
yesterday
who
did
their
first
courting
under
its
roof
forty
years
ago
he
has
been
married
twice
and
she
once
in
the
interval
but
the
old
love
held
firm
and
now
at
the
age
of
sixty
and
over
they
have
come
together
to
finish
their
days
in
peace
and
happiness
or
so
we
will
married
married
in
that
house
and
on
the
day
that
she
caught
herself
up
in
time
he
did
not
notice
the
break
yes
in
memory
of
those
old
days
of
courtship
i
suppose
they
came
here
about
five
got
the
keys
drove
off
went
through
the
ceremony
in
that
empty
house
returned
the
keys
to
me
in
my
own
apartment
took
the
steamer
for
naples
and
were
on
the
sea
before
midnight
do
you
not
call
that
quick
work
as
well
as
highly
romantic
miss
strange
s
cheek
had
paled
it
was
apt
to
when
she
was
greatly
excited
but
i
don
t
understand
she
added
the
moment
after
how
could
they
do
this
and
nobody
know
about
it
i
should
have
thought
it
would
have
got
into
the
they
are
quiet
people
i
don
t
think
they
told
their
best
friends
a
simple
announcement
in
the
next
day
s
journals
testified
to
the
fact
of
their
marriage
but
that
was
all
i
would
not
have
felt
at
liberty
to
mention
the
circumstances
myself
if
the
parties
were
not
well
on
their
way
to
oh
how
glad
i
am
that
you
did
tell
me
such
a
story
of
constancy
and
the
hold
which
old
associations
have
upon
sensitive
minds
but
why
miss
what
s
the
matter
you
look
very
much
don
t
you
remember
haven
t
you
thought
something
else
happened
that
very
day
and
almost
at
the
same
time
on
that
block
something
very
dreadful
mrs
doolittle
s
murder
yes
it
was
as
near
as
next
door
wasn
t
it
oh
if
this
happy
couple
had
known
but
fortunately
they
didn
t
nor
are
they
likely
to
till
they
reach
the
other
side
you
needn
t
fear
that
their
honeymoon
will
be
spoiled
that
but
they
may
have
heard
something
or
seen
something
before
leaving
the
street
did
you
notice
how
the
gentleman
looked
when
he
returned
you
the
keys
i
did
and
there
was
no
cloud
on
his
oh
how
you
relieve
me
one
two
dimples
made
their
appearance
in
miss
strange
s
fresh
young
cheeks
well
i
wish
them
joy
do
you
mind
telling
me
their
names
i
can
not
think
of
them
as
actual
persons
without
knowing
their
the
gentleman
was
constantin
amidon
the
lady
marian
shaffer
you
will
have
to
think
of
them
now
as
and
and
i
will
thank
you
hutton
thank
you
very
much
next
to
the
pleasure
of
getting
the
house
for
my
friend
is
that
of
hearing
this
charming
bit
of
news
its
she
held
out
her
hand
and
as
he
took
it
remarked
they
must
have
had
a
clergyman
and
i
wish
i
had
been
one
of
the
witnesses
she
sighed
sentimentally
they
were
two
old
oh
no
don
t
tell
me
fogies
nothing
but
the
clergyman
he
must
have
been
young
surely
there
was
some
one
there
capable
of
appreciating
the
situation
i
can
t
say
about
that
i
did
not
see
the
oh
well
it
doesn
t
miss
strange
s
manner
was
as
nonchalant
as
it
was
charming
we
will
think
of
him
as
being
very
and
with
a
merry
toss
of
her
head
she
flitted
away
but
she
sobered
very
rapidly
upon
entering
her
limousine
hello
ah
is
that
you
yes
i
want
a
marconi
a
marconi
yes
to
the
cretic

very
night
in
which
we
are
so
deeply
good

captain

to
a
constantin
amidon
but

be
sure

there
excuse
my
not
stating
over
the
telephone
the
message
is
to
be
to
this
effect
did
she
at
any
time
immediately
before
or
after
her
marriage
to
amidon
get
a
glimpse
of
any
one
in
the
adjoining
house
no
remarks
please
i
use
the
telephone
because
i
am
not
ready
to
explain
myself
if
she
did
let
her
send
a
written
description
to
you
of
that
person
as
soon
as
she
reaches
the
you
surprise
me
may
i
not
call
or
hope
for
a
line
from
you
early
i
shall
be
busy
till
you
get
your
he
hung
up
the
receiver
he
recognized
the
resolute
tone
but
the
time
came
when
the
pending
explanation
was
fully
given
to
him
an
answer
had
been
returned
from
the
steamer
favourable
to
violet
s
hopes
amidon
had
seen
such
a
person
and
would
send
a
full
description
of
the
same
at
the
first
opportunity
it
was
news
to
fill
violet
s
heart
with
pride
the
filament
of
a
clue
which
had
led
to
this
great
result
had
been
so
nearly
invisible
and
had
felt
so
like
nothing
in
her
grasp
to
her
employer
she
described
it
as
follows
when
i
hear
or
read
of
a
case
which
contains
any
baffling
features
i
am
apt
to
feel
some
hidden
chord
in
my
nature
thrill
to
one
fact
in
it
and
not
to
any
of
the
others
in
this
case
the
single
fact
which
appealed
to
my
imagination
was
the
dropping
of
the
stolen
wallet
in
that
upstairs
room
why
did
the
guilty
man
drop
it
and
why
having
dropped
it
did
he
not
pick
it
up
again
but
one
answer
seemed
possible
he
had
heard
or
seen
something
at
the
spot
where
it
fell
which
not
only
alarmed
him
but
sent
him
in
flight
from
the
very
good
and
did
you
settle
to
your
own
mind
the
nature
of
that
sound
or
that
sight
i
her
manner
was
strangely
businesslike
no
show
of
dimples
now
satisfied
that
if
any
possibility
remained
of
my
ever
doing
this
it
would
have
to
be
on
the
exact
place
of
this
occurrence
or
not
at
all
i
embraced
your
suggestion
and
visited
the
and
that
room
no
and
that
room
women
somehow
seem
to
manage
such
so
i
ve
noticed
miss
strange
and
what
was
the
result
of
your
visit
what
did
you
discover
there
this
that
one
of
the
blood
spots
marking
the
criminal
s
steps
through
the
room
was
decidedly
more
pronounced
than
the
rest
and
what
was
even
more
important
that
the
window
out
of
which
i
was
looking
had
its
counterpart
in
the
house
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
alley
in
gazing
through
the
one
i
was
gazing
through
the
other
and
not
only
that
but
into
the
darkened
area
of
the
room
beyond
instantly
i
saw
how
the
latter
fact
might
be
made
to
explain
the
former
one
but
before
i
say
how
let
me
ask
if
it
is
quite
settled
among
you
that
the
smears
on
the
floor
and
stairs
mark
the
passage
of
the
criminal
s
footsteps
certainly
and
very
bloody
feet
they
must
have
been
too
his
shoes
or
rather
his
one
shoe
for
the
proof
is
plain
that
only
the
right
one
left
its
mark
must
have
become
thoroughly
saturated
to
carry
its
traces
so
do
you
think
that
any
amount
of
saturation
would
have
done
this
or
if
you
are
not
ready
to
agree
to
that
that
a
shoe
so
covered
with
blood
could
have
failed
to
leave
behind
it
some
hint
of
its
shape
some
imprint
however
faint
of
heel
or
toe
but
nowhere
did
it
do
this
we
see
a
smear
and
that
is
you
are
right
miss
strange
you
are
always
right
and
what
do
you
gather
from
this
she
looked
to
see
how
much
he
expected
from
her
and
meeting
an
eye
not
quite
as
free
from
ironic
suggestion
as
his
words
had
led
her
to
expect
faltered
a
little
as
she
proceeded
to
say
my
opinion
is
a
girl
s
opinion
but
such
as
it
is
you
have
the
right
to
have
it
from
the
indications
mentioned
i
could
draw
but
this
conclusion
that
the
blood
which
accompanied
the
criminal
s
footsteps
was
not
carried
through
the
house
by
his
shoes
he
wore
no
shoes
he
did
not
even
wear
stockings
probably
he
had
none
for
reasons
which
appealed
to
his
judgment
he
went
about
his
wicked
work
barefoot
and
it
was
the
blood
from
his
own
veins
and
not
from
those
of
his
victim
which
made
the
trail
we
have
followed
with
so
much
interest
do
you
forget
those
broken
beads
how
he
kicked
them
about
and
stamped
upon
them
in
his
fury
one
of
them
pierced
the
ball
of
his
foot
and
that
so
sharply
that
it
not
only
spurted
blood
but
kept
on
bleeding
with
every
step
he
took
otherwise
the
trail
would
have
been
lost
after
his
passage
up
the
fine
there
was
no
irony
in
the
s
eye
now
you
are
progressing
miss
strange
allow
me
i
pray
to
kiss
your
hand
it
is
a
liberty
i
have
never
taken
but
one
which
would
greatly
relieve
my
present
stress
of
she
lifted
her
hand
toward
him
but
it
was
in
gesture
not
in
recognition
of
his
homage
thank
you
said
she
but
i
claim
no
monopoly
on
deductions
so
simple
as
these
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
that
not
only
yourself
but
every
member
of
the
force
has
made
the
same
but
there
is
a
little
matter
which
may
have
escaped
the
police
may
even
have
escaped
you
to
that
i
would
now
call
your
attention
since
through
it
i
have
been
enabled
after
a
little
necessary
groping
to
reach
the
open
you
remember
the
one
large
blotch
on
the
upper
floor
where
the
man
dropped
the
wallet
that
blotch
more
or
less
commingled
with
a
fainter
one
possessed
great
significance
for
me
from
the
first
moment
i
saw
it
how
came
his
foot
to
bleed
so
much
more
profusely
at
that
one
spot
than
at
any
other
there
could
be
but
one
answer
because
here
a
surprise
met
him
a
surprise
so
startling
to
him
in
his
present
state
of
mind
that
he
gave
a
quick
spring
backward
with
the
result
that
his
wounded
foot
came
down
suddenly
and
forcibly
instead
of
easily
as
in
his
previous
wary
tread
and
what
was
the
surprise
i
made
it
my
business
to
find
out
and
now
i
can
tell
you
that
it
was
the
sight
of
a
woman
s
face
staring
upon
him
from
the
neighbouring
house
which
he
had
probably
been
told
was
empty
the
shock
disturbed
his
judgment
he
saw
his
crime
discovered
his
guilty
secret
read
and
fled
in
unreasoning
panic
he
might
better
have
held
on
to
his
wits
it
was
this
display
of
fear
which
led
me
to
search
after
its
cause
and
consequently
to
discover
that
at
this
especial
hour
more
than
one
person
had
been
in
the
shaffer
house
that
in
fact
a
marriage
had
been
celebrated
there
under
circumstances
as
romantic
as
any
we
read
of
in
books
and
that
this
marriage
privately
carried
out
had
been
followed
by
an
immediate
voyage
of
the
happy
couple
on
one
of
the
white
star
steamers
with
the
rest
you
are
conversant
i
do
not
need
to
say
anything
about
what
has
followed
the
sending
of
that
but
i
am
going
to
say
something
about
your
work
in
this
matter
miss
strange
the
big
detectives
about
here
will
have
to
look
sharp
if
don
t
please
not
a
smile
softened
the
asperity
of
this
interruption
the
man
has
yet
to
be
caught
and
identified
till
that
is
done
i
can
not
enjoy
any
one
s
congratulations
and
you
will
see
that
all
this
may
not
be
so
easy
if
no
one
happened
to
meet
the
desperate
wretch
before
he
had
an
opportunity
to
retie
his
there
will
be
little
for
you
or
even
for
the
police
to
go
upon
but
his
wounded
foot
his
undoubtedly
carefully
prepared
alibi
and
later
a
woman
s
confused
description
of
a
face
seen
but
for
a
moment
only
and
that
under
a
personal
excitement
precluding
minute
attention
i
should
not
be
surprised
if
the
whole
thing
came
to
but
it
did
not
as
soon
as
the
description
was
received
from
amidon
a
description
by
the
way
which
was
unusually
clear
and
precise
owing
to
the
peculiar
and
contradictory
features
of
the
man
the
police
were
able
to
recognize
him
among
the
many
suspects
always
under
their
eye
arrested
he
pleaded
just
as
miss
strange
had
foretold
an
alibi
of
a
seemingly
unimpeachable
character
but
neither
it
nor
the
plausible
explanation
with
which
he
endeavoured
to
account
for
a
freshly
healed
scar
amid
the
callouses
of
his
right
foot
could
stand
before
amidon
s
unequivocal
testimony
that
he
was
the
same
man
she
had
seen
in
doolittle
s
upper
room
on
the
afternoon
of
her
own
happiness
and
of
that
poor
woman
s
murder
the
moment
when
at
his
trial
the
two
faces
again
confronted
each
other
across
a
space
no
wider
than
that
which
had
separated
them
on
the
dread
occasion
in
seventeenth
street
is
said
to
have
been
one
of
the
most
dramatic
in
the
annals
of
that
ancient
court

the

spectre
miss
strange
was
not
often
pensive
at
least
not
at
large
functions
or
when
under
the
public
eye
but
she
certainly
forgot
herself
at
provost
s
musicale
and
that
too
without
apparent
reason
had
the
music
been
of
a
high
order
one
might
have
understood
her
abstraction
but
it
was
of
a
decidedly
mediocre
quality
and
violet
s
ear
was
much
too
fine
and
her
musical
sense
too
cultivated
for
her
to
be
beguiled
by
anything
less
than
the
very
best
nor
had
she
the
excuse
of
a
dull
companion
her
escort
for
the
evening
was
a
man
of
unusual
conversational
powers
but
she
seemed
to
be
almost
oblivious
of
his
presence
and
when
through
some
passing
courteous
impulse
she
did
turn
her
ear
his
way
it
was
with
just
that
tinge
of
preoccupation
which
betrays
the
divided
mind
were
her
thoughts
with
some
secret
problem
yet
unsolved
it
would
scarcely
seem
so
from
the
gay
remark
with
which
she
had
left
home
she
was
speaking
to
her
brother
and
her
words
were
i
am
going
out
to
enjoy
myself
i
ve
not
a
care
in
the
world
the
slate
is
quite
yet
she
had
never
seemed
more
out
of
tune
with
her
surroundings
nor
shown
a
mood
further
removed
from
trivial
entertainment
what
had
happened
to
becloud
her
gaiety
in
the
short
time
which
had
since
elapsed
we
can
answer
in
a
sentence
she
had
seen
among
a
group
of
young
men
in
a
distant
doorway
one
with
a
face
so
individual
and
of
an
expression
so
extraordinary
that
all
interest
in
the
people
about
her
had
stopped
as
a
clock
stops
when
the
pendulum
is
held
back
she
could
see
nothing
else
think
of
nothing
else
not
that
it
was
so
very
handsome
though
no
other
had
ever
approached
it
in
its
power
over
her
imagination
but
because
of
its
expression
of
haunting
melancholy
a
melancholy
so
settled
and
so
evidently
the
result
of
sorrow
that
her
interest
had
been
reached
and
her
heartstrings
shaken
as
never
before
in
her
whole
life
she
would
never
be
the
same
violet
again
yet
moved
as
she
undoubtedly
was
she
was
not
conscious
of
the
least
desire
to
know
who
the
young
man
was
or
even
to
be
made
acquainted
with
his
story
she
simply
wanted
to
dream
her
dream
undisturbed
it
was
therefore
with
a
sense
of
unwelcome
shock
that
in
the
course
of
the
reception
following
the
programme
she
perceived
this
fine
young
man
approaching
herself
with
his
right
hand
touching
his
left
shoulder
in
the
peculiar
way
which
committed
her
to
an
interview
with
or
without
a
formal
introduction
should
she
fly
the
ordeal
be
blind
and
deaf
to
whatever
was
significant
in
his
action
and
go
her
way
before
he
reached
her
thus
keeping
her
dream
intact
impossible
his
eye
prevented
that
his
glance
had
caught
hers
and
she
felt
forced
to
await
his
advance
and
give
him
her
first
spare
moment
it
came
soon
and
when
it
came
she
greeted
him
with
a
smile
it
was
the
first
she
had
ever
bestowed
in
welcome
of
a
confidence
of
whose
tenor
she
was
entirely
ignorant
to
her
relief
he
showed
his
appreciation
of
the
dazzling
gift
though
he
made
no
effort
to
return
it
scorning
all
preliminaries
in
his
eagerness
to
discharge
himself
of
a
burden
which
was
fast
becoming
intolerable
he
addressed
her
at
once
in
these
words
you
are
very
good
miss
strange
to
receive
me
in
this
unconventional
fashion
i
am
in
that
desperate
state
of
mind
which
precludes
etiquette
will
you
listen
to
my
petition
i
am
told
you
know
by
whom
and
he
again
touched
his
shoulder
that
you
have
resources
of
intelligence
which
especially
fit
you
to
meet
the
extraordinary
difficulties
of
my
position
may
i
beg
you
to
exercise
them
in
my
behalf
no
man
would
be
more
grateful
if
but
i
see
that
you
do
not
recognize
me
i
am
roger
upjohn
that
i
am
admitted
to
this
gathering
is
owing
to
the
fact
that
our
hostess
knew
and
loved
my
mother
in
my
anxiety
to
meet
you
and
proffer
my
plea
i
was
willing
to
brave
the
cold
looks
you
have
probably
noticed
on
the
faces
of
the
people
about
us
but
i
have
no
right
to
subject
you
to
criticism
i
violet
s
voice
was
troubled
her
disturbed
but
there
was
a
command
in
her
tone
which
he
was
only
too
glad
to
obey
i
know
the
name
who
did
not
and
possibly
my
duty
to
myself
should
make
me
shun
a
confidence
which
may
burden
me
without
relieving
you
but
you
have
been
sent
to
me
by
one
whose
behests
i
feel
bound
to
respect
and
mistrusting
her
voice
she
stopped
the
suffering
which
made
itself
apparent
in
the
face
before
her
appealed
to
her
heart
in
a
way
to
rob
her
of
her
judgment
she
did
not
wish
this
to
be
seen
and
so
fell
silent
he
was
quick
to
take
advantage
of
her
obvious
embarrassment
should
i
have
been
sent
to
you
if
i
had
not
first
secured
the
confidence
of
the
sender
you
know
the
scandal
attached
to
my
name
some
of
it
just
some
of
it
very
unjust
if
you
will
grant
me
an
interview
i
will
make
an
endeavour
to
refute
certain
charges
which
i
have
hitherto
let
go
unchallenged
will
you
do
me
this
favour
will
you
listen
in
your
own
house
to
what
i
have
to
say
instinct
cried
out
against
any
such
concession
on
her
part
bidding
her
beware
of
one
who
charmed
without
excellence
and
convinced
without
reason
but
compassion
urged
compliance
and
compassion
won
the
day
though
conscious
of
weakness
she
violet
strange
on
whom
strong
men
had
come
to
rely
in
critical
hours
calling
for
judgment
she
did
not
let
this
concern
her
or
allow
herself
to
indulge
in
useless
regrets
even
after
the
first
effect
of
his
presence
had
passed
and
she
had
succeeded
in
recalling
the
facts
which
had
cast
a
cloud
about
his
name
roger
upjohn
was
a
widower
and
the
scandal
affecting
him
was
connected
with
his
wife
s
death
though
a
degenerate
in
some
respects
lacking
the
domineering
presence
the
strong
mental
qualities
and
inflexible
character
of
his
progenitors
the
wealthy
massachusetts
upjohns
whose
great
place
on
the
coast
had
a
history
as
old
as
the
state
itself
he
yet
had
gifts
and
attractions
of
his
own
which
would
have
made
him
a
worthy
representative
of
his
race
if
only
he
had
not
fixed
his
affections
on
a
woman
so
cold
and
heedless
that
she
would
have
inspired
universal
aversion
instead
of
love
had
she
not
been
dowered
with
the
beauty
and
physical
fascination
which
sometimes
accompany
a
hard
heart
and
a
scheming
brain
it
was
this
beauty
which
had
caught
the
lad
and
one
day
just
as
the
careful
father
had
mapped
out
a
course
of
study
calculated
to
make
a
man
of
his
son
that
son
drove
up
to
the
gates
with
this
lady
whom
he
introduced
as
his
wife
the
shock
not
of
her
beauty
though
that
was
of
the
dazzling
quality
which
catches
a
man
in
the
throat
and
makes
a
slave
of
him
while
the
first
surprise
lasts
but
of
the
overthrow
of
all
his
hopes
and
plans
nearly
prostrated
homer
upjohn
he
saw
as
most
men
did
the
moment
judgment
returned
that
for
all
her
satin
skin
and
rosy
flush
the
wonder
of
her
hair
and
the
smile
which
pierced
like
arrows
and
warmed
like
wine
she
was
more
likely
to
bring
a
curse
into
the
house
than
a
blessing
and
so
it
proved
in
less
than
a
year
the
young
husband
had
lost
all
his
ambitions
and
many
of
his
best
impulses
no
longer
inclined
to
study
he
spent
his
days
in
satisfying
his
wife
s
whims
and
his
evenings
in
carousing
with
the
friends
with
which
she
had
provided
him
this
in
boston
whither
they
had
fled
from
the
old
gentleman
s
displeasure
but
after
their
little
son
came
the
father
insisted
upon
their
returning
home
which
led
to
great
deceptions
and
precipitated
a
tragedy
no
one
ever
understood
they
were
natural
gamblers
this
couple
as
all
boston
society
knew
and
as
homer
upjohn
loathed
cards
they
found
life
slow
in
the
great
house
and
grew
correspondingly
restless
till
they
made
a
discovery
or
shall
i
say
a
rediscovery
of
the
once
famous
grotto
hidden
in
the
rocks
lining
their
portion
of
the
coast
here
they
found
a
retreat
where
they
could
hide
themselves
often
when
they
were
thought
to
be
abed
and
asleep
and
play
together
for
money
or
for
a
supper
in
the
city
or
for
anything
else
that
foolish
fancy
suggested
this
was
while
their
little
son
remained
an
infant
later
they
were
less
easily
satisfied
both
craved
company
excitement
and
gambling
on
a
large
scale
so
they
took
to
inviting
friends
to
meet
them
in
this
grotto
which
through
the
agency
of
one
old
servant
devoted
to
roger
to
the
point
of
folly
had
been
fitted
up
and
lighted
in
a
manner
not
only
comfortable
but
luxurious
a
small
but
sheltered
haven
hidden
in
the
curve
of
the
rocks
made
an
approach
by
boat
feasible
at
high
tide
and
at
low
the
connection
could
be
made
by
means
of
a
path
over
the
promontory
in
which
this
grotto
lay
concealed
the
fortune
which
roger
had
inherited
from
his
mother
made
these
excesses
possible
but
many
thousands
let
alone
the
few
he
could
call
his
soon
disappeared
under
the
witchery
of
an
irresponsible
woman
and
the
friends
who
knew
his
secret
had
to
stand
by
and
see
his
ruin
without
daring
to
utter
a
word
to
the
one
who
alone
could
stay
it
for
homer
upjohn
was
not
a
man
to
be
approached
lightly
nor
was
he
one
to
listen
to
charges
without
ocular
proof
to
support
them
and
this
called
for
courage
more
courage
than
was
possessed
by
any
one
who
knew
them
both
he
was
a
hard
man
was
homer
upjohn
but
with
a
heart
of
gold
for
those
he
loved
this
even
his
wary
was
wise
enough
to
detect
and
for
a
long
while
after
the
birth
of
her
child
she
besieged
him
with
her
coaxing
ways
and
bewitching
graces
but
he
never
changed
his
first
opinion
of
her
and
once
she
became
fully
convinced
of
the
folly
of
her
efforts
she
gave
up
all
attempt
to
please
him
and
showed
an
open
indifference
this
in
time
gradually
extended
till
it
embraced
not
only
her
child
but
her
husband
as
well
yes
it
had
come
to
that
his
love
no
longer
contented
her
her
vanity
had
grown
by
what
it
daily
fed
on
and
now
called
for
the
admiration
of
the
fast
men
who
sometimes
came
up
from
boston
to
play
with
them
in
their
unholy
retreat
to
win
this
she
dressed
like
some
demon
queen
or
witch
though
it
drove
her
husband
into
deeper
play
and
threatened
an
exposure
which
would
mean
disaster
not
only
to
herself
but
to
the
whole
family
in
all
this
as
any
one
could
see
roger
had
been
her
slave
and
the
willing
victim
of
all
her
caprices
what
was
it
then
which
so
completely
changed
him
that
a
separation
began
to
be
talked
of
and
even
its
terms
discussed
one
rumour
had
it
that
the
father
had
discovered
the
secret
of
the
grotto
and
exacted
this
as
a
penalty
from
the
son
who
had
dishonoured
him
another
that
roger
himself
was
the
one
to
take
the
initiative
in
this
matter
that
on
returning
unexpectedly
from
new
york
one
evening
and
finding
her
missing
from
the
house
he
had
traced
her
to
the
grotto
where
he
came
upon
her
playing
a
desperate
game
with
the
one
man
he
had
the
greatest
reason
to
distrust
but
whatever
the
explanation
of
this
sudden
change
in
their
relations
there
is
but
little
doubt
that
a
legal
separation
between
this
couple
was
pending
when
one
bleak
autumn
morning
she
was
discovered
dead
in
her
bed
under
circumstances
peculiarly
open
to
comment
the
physicians
who
made
out
the
certificate
ascribed
her
death
to
symptoms
of
which
had
lately
much
alarmed
the
family
doctor
but
that
a
personal
struggle
of
some
kind
had
preceded
the
fatal
attack
was
evident
from
the
bruises
which
blackened
her
wrists
had
there
been
the
like
upon
her
throat
it
might
have
gone
hard
with
the
young
husband
who
was
known
to
be
contemplating
her
dismissal
from
the
house
but
the
discoloration
of
her
wrists
was
all
and
as
bruised
wrists
do
not
kill
and
there
was
besides
no
evidence
forthcoming
of
the
two
having
spent
one
moment
together
for
at
least
ten
hours
preceding
the
tragedy
but
rather
full
and
satisfactory
testimony
to
the
contrary
the
matter
lapsed
and
all
criminal
proceedings
were
avoided
but
not
the
scandal
which
always
follows
the
unexplained
as
time
passed
and
the
peculiar
look
which
betrays
the
haunted
soul
gradually
became
visible
in
the
young
widower
s
eyes
doubts
arose
and
reports
circulated
which
cast
strange
reflections
upon
the
tragic
end
of
his
mistaken
marriage
stories
of
the
disreputable
use
to
which
the
old
grotto
had
been
put
were
mingled
with
vague
hints
of
conjugal
violence
never
properly
investigated
the
result
was
his
general
avoidance
not
only
by
the
social
set
dominated
by
his
father
but
by
his
own
less
reputable
coterie
which
however
lax
in
its
moral
code
had
very
little
use
for
a
coward
such
was
the
gossip
which
had
reached
violet
s
ears
in
connection
with
this
new
client
prejudicing
her
altogether
against
him
till
she
caught
that
beam
of
deep
and
concentrated
suffering
in
his
eye
and
recognized
an
innocence
which
ensured
her
sympathy
and
led
her
to
grant
him
the
interview
for
which
he
so
earnestly
entreated
he
came
prompt
to
the
hour
and
when
she
saw
him
again
with
the
marks
of
a
sleepless
night
upon
him
and
all
the
signs
of
suffering
intensified
in
his
unusual
countenance
she
felt
her
heart
sink
within
her
in
a
way
she
failed
to
understand
a
dread
of
what
she
was
about
to
hear
robbed
her
of
all
semblance
of
and
she
stood
like
one
in
a
dream
as
he
uttered
his
first
greetings
and
then
paused
to
gather
up
his
own
moral
strength
before
he
began
his
story
when
he
did
speak
it
was
to
say
i
find
myself
obliged
to
break
a
vow
i
have
made
to
myself
you
can
not
understand
my
need
unless
i
show
you
my
heart
my
trouble
is
not
the
one
with
which
men
have
credited
me
it
has
another
source
and
is
infinitely
harder
to
bear
personal
dishonour
i
have
deserved
in
a
greater
or
less
degree
but
the
trial
which
has
come
to
me
now
involves
a
person
more
dear
to
me
than
myself
and
is
totally
without
alleviation
unless
you
he
paused
choked
then
recommenced
abruptly
my
wife
violet
held
her
breath
was
supposed
to
have
died
from
or
or
some
strange
species
of
suicide
there
were
reasons
for
this
conclusion
reasons
which
i
accepted
without
serious
question
till
some
five
weeks
ago
when
i
made
a
discovery
which
led
me
to
fear
the
broken
sentence
hung
suspended
violet
notwithstanding
his
hurried
gesture
could
not
restrain
herself
from
stealing
a
look
at
his
face
it
was
set
in
horror
and
though
partially
turned
aside
made
an
appeal
to
her
compassion
to
fill
the
void
made
by
his
silence
without
further
suggestion
from
him
she
did
this
by
saying
tentatively
and
with
as
little
show
of
emotion
as
possible
you
feared
that
the
event
called
for
vengeance
and
that
vengeance
would
mean
increased
suffering
to
yourself
as
well
as
to
another
yes
great
suffering
but
i
may
be
under
a
most
lamentable
mistake
i
am
not
sure
of
my
conclusions
if
my
doubts
have
no
real
foundation
if
they
are
simply
the
offspring
of
my
own
diseased
imagination
what
an
insult
to
one
i
revere
what
a
horror
of
ingratitude
and
misunderstanding
relate
the
facts
came
in
startled
tones
from
violet
they
may
enlighten
he
gave
one
quick
shudder
buried
his
face
for
one
moment
in
his
hands
then
lifted
it
and
spoke
up
quickly
and
with
unexpected
firmness
i
came
here
to
do
so
and
do
so
i
will
but
where
begin
miss
strange
you
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
circumstances
open
and
avowed
which
attended
my
wife
s
death
but
there
were
other
and
secret
events
in
its
connection
which
happily
have
been
kept
from
the
world
but
which
i
must
now
disclose
to
you
at
any
cost
to
my
pride
and
honour
this
is
the
first
one
on
the
morning
preceding
the
day
of
upjohn
s
death
an
interview
took
place
between
us
at
which
my
father
was
present
you
do
not
know
my
father
miss
strange
a
strong
man
and
a
stern
one
with
a
hold
upon
old
traditions
which
nothing
can
shake
if
he
has
a
weakness
it
is
for
my
little
boy
roger
in
whose
promising
traits
he
sees
the
one
hope
which
has
survived
the
shipwreck
of
all
for
which
our
name
has
stood
knowing
this
and
realizing
what
the
child
s
presence
in
the
house
meant
to
his
old
age
i
felt
my
heart
turn
sick
with
apprehension
when
in
the
midst
of
the
discussion
as
to
the
terms
on
which
my
wife
would
consent
to
a
permanent
separation
the
little
fellow
came
dancing
into
the
room
his
curls
atoss
and
his
whole
face
beaming
with
life
and
joy
she
had
not
mentioned
the
child
but
i
knew
her
well
enough
to
be
sure
that
at
the
first
show
of
preference
on
his
part
for
either
his
grandfather
or
myself
she
would
raise
a
claim
to
him
which
she
would
never
relinquish
i
dared
not
speak
but
i
met
his
eager
looks
with
my
most
forbidding
frown
and
hoped
by
this
show
of
severity
to
hold
him
back
but
his
little
heart
was
full
and
ignoring
her
outstretched
arms
he
bounded
towards
mine
with
his
most
affectionate
cry
she
saw
and
uttered
her
ultimatum
the
child
should
go
with
her
or
she
would
not
consent
to
a
separation
it
was
useless
for
us
to
talk
she
had
said
her
last
word
the
blow
struck
me
hard
or
so
i
thought
till
i
looked
at
my
father
never
had
i
beheld
such
a
change
as
that
one
moment
had
made
in
him
he
stood
as
before
he
faced
us
with
the
same
silent
reprobation
but
his
heart
had
run
from
him
like
water
it
was
a
sight
to
call
up
all
my
resources
to
allow
her
to
remain
now
with
my
feelings
towards
her
all
changed
and
my
father
s
eyes
fully
opened
to
her
stony
nature
was
impossible
nor
could
i
appeal
to
law
an
open
scandal
was
my
father
s
greatest
dread
and
divorce
proceedings
his
horror
the
child
would
have
to
go
unless
i
could
find
a
way
to
influence
her
through
her
own
nature
i
knew
of
but
one
do
not
look
at
me
miss
strange
it
was
dishonouring
to
us
both
and
i
m
horrified
now
when
i
think
of
it
but
to
me
at
that
time
it
was
natural
enough
as
a
last
resort
there
was
but
one
debt
which
my
wife
ever
paid
but
one
promise
she
ever
kept
it
was
that
made
at
the
i
offered
as
soon
as
my
father
realizing
the
hopelessness
of
the
situation
had
gone
tottering
from
the
room
to
gamble
with
her
for
the
child
and
she
the
shame
and
humiliation
expressed
in
this
final
whisper
the
sudden
darkness
for
a
storm
was
coming
up
shook
violet
to
the
soul
with
strained
gaze
fixed
on
the
man
before
her
now
little
more
than
a
shadow
in
the
prevailing
gloom
she
waited
for
him
to
resume
and
waited
in
vain
the
minutes
passed
the
darkness
became
intolerable
and
instinctively
her
hand
crept
towards
the
electric
button
beneath
which
she
was
sitting
but
she
failed
to
press
it
a
tale
so
dark
called
for
an
atmosphere
of
its
own
kind
she
would
cast
no
light
upon
it
yet
she
shivered
as
the
silence
continued
and
started
in
uncontrollable
dismay
when
at
length
her
strange
visitor
rose
and
still
without
speaking
walked
away
from
her
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
only
so
could
he
go
on
with
the
shameful
tale
and
presently
she
heard
his
voice
once
more
in
these
words
our
house
is
large
and
its
rooms
many
but
for
such
work
as
we
two
contemplated
there
was
but
one
spot
where
we
could
command
absolute
seclusion
you
may
have
heard
of
it
a
famous
natural
grotto
hidden
in
our
own
portion
of
the
coast
and
so
fitted
up
as
to
form
a
retreat
for
our
miserable
selves
when
escape
from
my
father
s
eye
seemed
desirable
it
was
not
easy
of
access
and
no
one
so
far
as
we
knew
had
ever
followed
us
there
but
to
ensure
ourselves
against
any
possible
interruption
we
waited
till
the
whole
house
was
abed
before
we
left
it
for
the
grotto
we
went
by
boat
and
oh
the
dip
of
those
oars
i
hear
them
yet
and
the
witchery
of
her
face
in
the
moonlight
and
the
mockery
of
her
low
fitful
laugh
as
i
caught
the
sinister
note
in
its
silvery
rise
and
fall
i
knew
what
was
before
me
if
i
failed
to
retain
my
composure
and
i
strove
to
hold
it
and
to
meet
her
calmness
with
stoicism
and
the
taunt
of
her
expression
with
a
mask
of
immobility
but
the
effort
was
hopeless
and
when
the
time
came
for
dealing
out
the
cards
my
eyes
were
burning
in
their
sockets
and
my
hands
shivering
like
leaves
in
a
rising
gale
we
played
one
game
and
my
wife
lost
we
played
another
and
my
wife
won
we
played
the
third
and
the
fate
i
had
foreseen
from
the
first
became
mine
the
luck
was
with
her
and
i
had
lost
my
boy
a
gasp
a
pause
during
which
the
thunder
spoke
and
the
lightning
flashed
then
a
hurried
catching
of
his
breath
and
the
tale
went
on
a
burst
of
laughter
rising
gaily
above
the
boom
of
the
sea
announced
her
victory
her
laugh
and
the
taunting
words
you
play
badly
roger
the
child
is
mine
never
fear
that
i
shall
fail
to
teach
him
to
revere
his
had
i
a
word
to
throw
back
no
when
i
realized
anything
but
my
dishonoured
manhood
i
found
myself
in
the
grotto
s
mouth
staring
helplessly
out
upon
the
sea
the
boat
which
had
floated
us
in
at
high
tide
lay
stranded
but
a
few
feet
away
but
i
did
not
reach
for
it
escape
was
quicker
over
the
rocks
and
i
made
for
the
rocks
that
it
was
a
cowardly
act
to
leave
her
there
to
find
her
way
back
alone
at
midnight
by
the
same
rough
road
i
was
taking
did
not
strike
my
mind
for
an
instant
i
was
in
flight
from
my
own
past
in
flight
from
myself
and
the
haunting
dread
of
madness
when
i
awoke
to
reality
again
it
was
to
find
the
small
door
by
which
we
had
left
the
house
standing
slightly
ajar
i
was
troubled
by
this
for
i
was
sure
of
having
closed
it
but
the
impression
was
brief
and
entering
i
went
stumbling
up
to
my
room
leaving
the
way
open
behind
me
more
from
sheer
inability
to
exercise
my
will
than
from
any
thought
of
her
miss
strange
he
had
come
out
of
the
shadows
and
was
standing
now
directly
before
her
i
must
ask
you
to
trust
implicitly
in
what
i
tell
you
of
my
further
experiences
that
fatal
night
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
pass
my
little
son
s
door
in
order
to
reach
the
room
i
was
making
for
but
anguish
took
me
there
and
held
me
glued
to
the
panels
for
what
seemed
a
long
long
time
when
i
finally
crept
away
it
was
to
go
to
the
room
i
had
chosen
in
the
top
of
the
house
where
i
had
my
hour
of
hell
and
faced
my
desolated
future
did
i
hear
anything
meantime
in
the
halls
below
no
did
i
even
listen
for
the
sound
of
her
return
no
i
was
callous
to
everything
dead
to
everything
but
my
own
misery
i
did
not
even
heed
the
approach
of
morning
till
suddenly
with
a
shrillness
no
ear
could
ignore
there
rose
tearing
through
the
silence
of
the
house
that
great
scream
from
my
wife
s
room
which
announced
the
discovery
of
her
body
lying
stark
and
cold
in
her
bed
they
said
i
showed
little
he
had
moved
off
again
and
spoke
from
somewhere
in
the
shadows
do
you
wonder
at
this
after
such
a
manifest
stroke
by
a
benevolent
providence
my
wife
being
dead
roger
was
saved
to
us
it
was
the
one
song
of
my
still
undisciplined
soul
and
i
had
to
assume
coldness
lest
they
should
see
the
greatness
of
my
joy
a
wicked
and
guilty
rejoicing
you
will
say
and
you
are
right
but
i
had
no
memory
then
of
the
part
i
had
played
in
this
fatality
i
had
forgotten
my
reckless
flight
from
the
grotto
which
left
her
with
no
aid
but
that
of
her
own
triumphant
spirit
to
help
her
over
those
treacherous
rocks
the
necessity
for
keeping
secret
this
part
of
our
disgraceful
story
led
me
to
exert
myself
to
keep
it
out
of
my
own
mind
it
has
only
come
back
to
me
in
all
its
force
since
a
new
horror
a
new
suspicion
has
driven
me
to
review
carefully
every
incident
of
that
awful
night
i
was
never
a
man
of
much
logic
and
when
they
came
to
me
on
that
morning
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
and
took
me
in
where
she
lay
and
pointed
to
her
beautiful
cold
body
stretched
out
in
seeming
peace
under
the
satin
coverlet
and
then
to
the
pile
of
dainty
clothes
lying
neatly
folded
on
a
chair
with
just
one
fairy
slipper
on
top
i
shuddered
at
her
fate
but
asked
no
questions
not
even
when
one
of
the
women
of
the
house
mentioned
the
circumstance
of
the
single
slipper
and
said
that
a
search
should
be
made
for
its
mate
nor
was
i
as
much
impressed
as
one
would
naturally
expect
by
the
whisper
dropped
in
my
ear
that
something
was
the
matter
with
her
wrists
it
is
true
that
i
lifted
the
lace
they
had
carefully
spread
over
them
and
examined
the
discoloration
which
extended
like
a
ring
about
each
pearly
arm
but
having
no
memories
of
any
violence
offered
her
i
had
not
so
much
as
laid
hand
upon
her
in
the
grotto
these
marks
failed
to
rouse
my
interest
but
and
now
i
must
leap
a
year
in
my
story
there
came
a
time
when
both
of
these
facts
recurred
to
my
mind
with
startling
distinctness
and
clamoured
for
explanation
i
had
risen
above
the
shock
which
such
a
death
following
such
events
would
naturally
occasion
even
in
one
of
my
blunted
sensibilities
and
was
striving
to
live
a
new
life
under
the
encouragement
of
my
now
fully
reconciled
father
when
accident
forced
me
to
the
grotto
where
i
had
never
stepped
foot
since
that
night
a
favourite
dog
in
chase
of
some
innocent
prey
had
escaped
the
leash
and
run
into
its
dim
recesses
and
would
not
come
out
at
my
call
as
i
needed
him
immediately
for
the
hunt
i
followed
him
over
the
promontory
and
swallowing
my
repugnance
slid
into
the
grotto
to
get
him
better
a
plunge
to
my
death
from
the
height
of
the
rocks
towering
above
it
for
there
in
a
remote
corner
lighted
up
by
a
reflection
from
the
sea
i
beheld
my
setter
crouched
above
an
object
which
in
another
moment
i
recognized
as
my
dead
wife
s
missing
slipper
here
not
in
the
waters
of
the
sea
or
in
the
interstices
of
the
rocks
outside
but
here
proof
that
she
had
never
walked
back
to
the
house
where
she
was
found
lying
quietly
in
her
bed
proof
positive
for
i
knew
the
path
too
well
and
the
more
than
usual
tenderness
of
her
feet
how
then
did
she
get
there
and
by
whose
agency
was
she
living
when
she
went
or
was
she
already
dead
a
year
had
passed
since
that
delicate
shoe
had
borne
her
from
the
boat
into
these
dim
recesses
but
it
might
have
been
only
a
day
so
vividly
did
i
live
over
in
this
moment
of
awful
enlightenment
all
the
events
of
the
hour
in
which
we
sat
there
playing
for
the
possession
of
our
child
again
i
saw
her
gleaming
eyes
her
rosy
working
mouth
her
slim
white
hand
loaded
with
diamonds
clutching
the
cards
again
i
heard
the
lap
of
the
sea
on
the
pebbles
outside
and
smelt
the
odour
of
the
wine
she
had
poured
out
for
us
both
the
bottle
which
had
held
it
the
glass
from
which
she
had
drunk
lay
now
in
pieces
on
the
rocky
floor
the
whole
scene
was
mine
again
and
as
i
followed
the
event
to
its
despairing
close
i
seemed
to
see
my
own
wild
figure
springing
away
from
her
to
the
grotto
s
mouth
and
so
over
the
rocks
but
here
fancy
faltered
caught
by
a
quick
recollection
to
which
i
had
never
given
a
thought
till
now
as
i
made
my
way
along
those
rocks
a
sound
had
struck
my
ear
from
where
some
stunted
bushes
made
a
shadow
in
the
moonlight
the
wind
might
have
caused
it
or
some
small
night
creature
hustling
away
at
my
approach
and
to
some
such
cause
i
must
at
the
time
have
attributed
it
but
now
with
brain
fired
by
suspicion
it
seemed
more
like
the
quick
intake
of
a
human
breath
some
one
had
been
lying
there
in
wait
listening
at
the
one
loophole
in
the
rocks
where
it
was
possible
to
hear
what
was
said
and
done
in
the
heart
of
the
grotto
but
who
who
and
for
what
purpose
this
listening
and
to
what
end
did
it
lead
though
i
no
longer
loved
even
the
memory
of
my
wife
i
felt
my
hair
lift
as
i
asked
myself
these
questions
there
seemed
to
be
but
one
logical
answer
to
the
last
and
it
was
this
a
struggle
followed
by
death
the
shoe
fallen
from
her
foot
the
clothes
found
folded
in
her
room
my
wife
was
never
orderly
and
the
dimly
blackened
wrists
which
were
when
she
dealt
the
cards
all
seemed
to
point
to
such
a
conclusion
she
may
have
died
from
but
a
struggle
had
preceded
her
death
during
which
some
man
s
strong
fingers
had
been
locked
about
her
wrists
and
again
the
question
rose
whose
if
any
place
was
ever
hated
by
mortal
man
that
grotto
was
hated
by
me
i
loathed
its
walls
its
floor
its
every
visible
and
invisible
corner
to
linger
there
to
look
almost
tore
my
soul
from
my
body
yet
i
did
linger
and
did
look
and
this
is
what
i
found
by
way
of
reward
behind
a
projecting
ledge
of
stone
from
which
a
tattered
rug
still
hung
i
came
upon
two
nails
driven
a
few
feet
apart
into
a
fissure
of
the
rock
i
had
driven
those
nails
myself
long
before
for
a
certain
gymnastic
attachment
much
in
vogue
at
the
time
and
on
looking
closer
i
discovered
hanging
from
them
the
by
which
i
was
wont
to
pull
myself
about
so
far
there
was
nothing
to
rouse
any
but
innocent
reminiscences
but
when
i
heard
the
dog
s
low
moan
and
saw
him
leap
at
the
ends
and
nose
them
with
an
eager
look
my
way
i
remembered
the
dark
marks
circling
the
wrists
about
which
i
had
so
often
clasped
my
mother
s
bracelets
and
the
world
went
black
before
me
when
consciousness
returned
when
i
could
once
more
move
and
see
and
think
i
noted
another
fact
cards
were
strewn
about
the
floor
face
up
and
in
a
fixed
order
as
if
laid
in
a
mocking
mood
to
be
looked
upon
by
reluctant
eyes
and
near
the
ominous
they
made
a
cushion
from
the
lounge
stained
horribly
with
what
i
then
thought
to
be
blood
but
which
i
afterwards
found
to
be
wine
vengeance
spoke
in
those
ropes
and
in
the
carefully
cards
and
murder
in
the
smothering
pillow
the
vengeance
of
one
who
had
watched
her
corroding
influence
eat
the
life
out
of
my
honour
and
whose
love
for
our
little
roger
was
such
that
any
deed
which
ensured
his
continued
presence
in
the
home
appeared
not
only
warrantable
but
obligatory
alas
i
knew
of
but
one
person
in
the
whole
world
who
could
cherish
feeling
to
this
extent
or
possess
sufficient
will
power
to
carry
her
lifeless
body
back
to
the
house
and
lay
it
in
her
bed
and
give
no
sign
of
the
abominable
act
from
that
day
on
to
this
miss
strange
there
are
men
who
have
a
peculiar
conception
of
duty
my
father
you
need
not
go
how
gently
how
tenderly
our
violet
spoke
i
understand
your
trouble
did
she
she
paused
to
ask
herself
if
this
were
so
and
he
deaf
perhaps
to
her
words
caught
up
his
broken
sentence
and
went
on
my
father
was
in
the
hall
the
day
i
came
staggering
in
from
my
visit
to
the
grotto
no
words
passed
but
our
eyes
met
and
from
that
hour
i
have
seen
death
in
his
countenance
and
he
has
seen
it
in
mine
like
two
opponents
each
struck
to
the
heart
who
stand
facing
each
other
with
simulated
smiles
till
they
fall
my
father
will
drop
first
he
is
old
very
old
since
that
day
five
weeks
ago
and
to
see
him
die
and
not
be
sure
to
see
the
grave
close
over
a
possible
innocence
and
i
left
here
in
ignorance
of
the
blissful
fact
till
my
own
eyes
close
forever
is
more
than
i
can
hold
up
under
more
than
any
son
could
can
not
you
help
me
then
to
a
positive
knowledge
think
think
a
woman
s
mind
is
strangely
penetrating
and
yours
i
am
told
has
an
intuitive
faculty
more
to
be
relied
upon
than
the
reasoning
of
men
it
must
suggest
some
means
of
confirming
my
doubts
or
of
definitely
ending
then
violet
stirred
and
looked
about
at
him
and
finally
found
voice
tell
me
something
about
your
father
s
ways
what
are
his
habits
does
he
sleep
well
or
is
he
wakeful
at
night
he
has
poor
nights
i
do
not
know
how
poor
because
i
am
not
often
with
him
his
valet
who
has
always
been
in
our
family
shares
his
room
and
acts
as
his
constant
nurse
he
can
watch
over
him
better
than
i
can
he
has
no
distracting
trouble
on
his
and
little
roger
does
your
father
see
much
of
little
roger
does
he
fondle
him
and
seem
happy
in
his
presence
yes
yes
i
have
often
wondered
at
it
but
he
does
they
are
great
chums
it
is
a
pleasure
to
see
them
and
the
child
clings
to
him
shows
no
fear
sits
on
his
lap
or
on
the
bed
and
plays
as
children
do
play
with
his
beard
or
with
his
yes
only
once
have
i
seen
my
little
chap
shrink
and
that
was
when
my
father
gave
him
a
look
of
unusual
intensity
looking
for
his
mother
in
him
mr
upjohn
forgive
me
the
question
it
seems
necessary
does
your
father
or
rather
did
your
father
before
he
fell
ill
ever
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
grotto
or
haunt
in
any
way
the
rocks
which
surround
it
i
can
not
say
the
sea
is
there
he
naturally
loves
the
sea
but
i
have
never
seen
him
standing
on
the
which
way
do
his
windows
look
towards
the
therefore
towards
the
promontory
can
he
see
it
from
his
bed
no
perhaps
that
is
the
cause
of
a
peculiar
habit
he
what
habit
every
night
before
he
retires
he
is
not
yet
confined
to
his
bed
he
stands
for
a
few
minutes
in
his
front
window
looking
out
he
says
it
s
his
to
the
ocean
when
he
no
longer
does
this
we
shall
know
that
his
end
is
very
the
face
of
violet
began
to
clear
rising
she
turned
on
the
electric
light
and
then
reseating
herself
remarked
with
an
aspect
of
quiet
cheer
i
have
two
ideas
but
they
necessitate
my
presence
at
your
place
you
will
not
mind
a
visit
my
brother
will
accompany
roger
upjohn
did
not
need
to
speak
hardly
to
make
a
gesture
his
expression
was
so
eloquent
she
thanked
him
as
if
he
had
answered
in
words
adding
with
an
air
of
gentle
reserve
providence
assists
us
in
this
matter
i
am
invited
to
beverly
next
week
to
attend
a
wedding
i
was
intending
to
stay
two
days
but
i
will
make
it
three
and
spend
the
extra
one
with
what
are
your
requirements
miss
strange
i
presume
you
have
violet
turned
from
the
imposing
portrait
of
upjohn
which
she
had
been
gravely
contemplating
and
met
the
troubled
eye
of
her
young
host
with
an
enigmatical
flash
of
her
own
but
she
made
no
answer
in
words
instead
she
lifted
her
right
hand
and
ran
one
slender
finger
thoughtfully
up
the
casing
of
the
door
near
which
they
stood
till
it
struck
a
nick
in
the
old
mahogany
almost
on
a
level
with
her
head
is
your
son
roger
old
enough
to
reach
so
far
she
asked
with
another
short
look
at
him
as
she
let
her
finger
rest
where
it
had
struck
the
roughened
wood
i
thought
he
was
a
little
he
is
that
cut
was
made
by
by
my
wife
a
sample
of
her
capricious
willfulness
she
wished
to
leave
a
record
of
herself
in
the
substance
of
our
house
as
well
as
in
our
lives
that
nick
marks
her
height
she
laughed
when
she
made
it
till
the
walls
cave
in
or
burn
is
what
she
said
and
i
thought
her
laugh
and
smile
cutting
short
his
own
laugh
which
was
much
too
sardonic
for
a
lady
s
ears
he
made
a
move
as
if
to
lead
the
way
into
another
portion
of
the
room
but
violet
failed
to
notice
this
and
lingering
in
quiet
contemplation
of
this
suggestive
little
nick
the
only
blemish
in
a
room
of
ancient
colonial
magnificence
she
thoughtfully
remarked
then
she
was
a
small
woman
adding
with
seeming
irrelevance
like
roger
winced
something
in
the
suggestion
hurt
him
and
in
the
nod
he
gave
there
was
an
air
of
coldness
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
deterred
her
from
pursuing
this
subject
further
but
the
circumstances
were
not
ordinary
and
she
allowed
herself
to
say
was
she
so
very
different
from
me
in
figure
i
mean
no
why
do
you
ask
shall
we
not
join
your
brother
on
the
terrace
not
till
i
have
answered
the
question
you
put
me
a
moment
ago
you
wished
to
know
my
requirements
one
of
the
most
important
you
have
already
fulfilled
you
have
given
your
servants
a
and
by
so
doing
ensured
to
us
full
liberty
of
action
what
else
i
need
in
the
attempt
i
propose
to
make
you
will
find
listed
in
this
and
taking
a
slip
of
paper
from
her
bag
she
offered
it
to
him
with
a
hand
the
trembling
of
which
he
would
have
noted
had
he
been
freer
in
mind
as
he
read
she
watched
him
her
fingers
nervously
clutching
her
throat
can
you
supply
what
i
ask
she
faltered
as
he
failed
to
raise
his
eyes
or
make
any
move
or
even
to
utter
the
groan
she
saw
surging
up
to
his
lips
will
you
she
impetuously
urged
as
his
fingers
closed
spasmodically
on
the
paper
in
evidence
that
he
understood
at
last
the
trend
of
her
daring
purpose
the
answer
came
slowly
but
it
came
i
will
but
what
her
hand
rose
in
a
pleading
gesture
do
not
ask
me
but
take
arthur
and
myself
into
the
garden
and
show
us
the
flowers
afterwards
i
should
like
a
glimpse
of
the
he
bowed
and
they
joined
arthur
who
had
already
begun
to
stroll
through
the
grounds
violet
was
seldom
at
a
loss
for
talk
even
at
the
most
critical
moments
but
she
was
strangely
on
this
occasion
as
was
roger
himself
save
for
a
few
observations
casually
thrown
out
by
arthur
the
three
passed
in
a
disquieting
silence
through
pergola
after
pergola
and
around
beds
gorgeous
with
every
variety
of
fall
flowers
till
they
turned
a
sharp
corner
and
came
in
full
view
of
the
sea
ah
fell
in
an
admiring
murmur
from
violet
s
lips
as
her
eyes
swept
the
horizon
then
as
they
settled
on
a
mass
of
rock
jutting
out
from
the
shore
in
a
great
curve
she
leaned
towards
her
host
and
softly
whispered
the
promontory
he
nodded
and
violet
ventured
no
farther
but
stood
for
a
little
while
gazing
at
the
tumbled
rocks
then
with
a
quick
look
back
at
the
house
she
asked
him
to
point
out
his
father
s
window
he
did
so
and
as
she
noted
how
openly
it
faced
the
sea
her
expression
relaxed
and
her
manner
lost
some
of
its
constraint
as
they
turned
to
the
house
she
noticed
an
old
man
picking
flowers
from
a
vine
clambering
over
one
end
of
the
piazza
who
is
that
she
asked
our
oldest
servant
and
my
father
s
own
man
was
roger
s
reply
he
is
picking
my
father
s
favourite
flowers
a
few
late
how
fortunate
speak
to
him
upjohn
ask
him
how
your
father
is
this
accompany
me
and
i
will
and
do
not
be
afraid
to
enter
into
conversation
with
him
he
is
the
mildest
of
creatures
and
devoted
to
his
patient
he
likes
nothing
better
than
to
talk
about
violet
with
a
meaning
look
at
her
brother
ran
up
the
steps
at
roger
s
side
as
she
did
so
the
old
man
turned
and
violet
was
astonished
at
the
wistfulness
with
which
he
viewed
her
what
a
dear
old
creature
she
murmured
see
how
he
stares
this
way
you
would
think
he
knew
he
is
glad
to
see
a
woman
about
the
place
he
has
felt
our
isolation
good
evening
abram
let
this
young
lady
have
a
spray
of
your
sweetest
honeysuckle
and
abram
before
you
go
how
is
father
still
sitting
up
yes
sir
he
is
very
regular
in
his
ways
nine
is
his
hour
not
a
minute
before
and
not
a
minute
later
i
don
t
have
to
look
at
the
clock
when
he
says
there
abram
i
ve
sat
up
long
when
my
father
retires
before
his
time
or
goes
to
bed
without
a
final
look
at
the
sea
he
will
be
a
very
sick
man
that
he
will
roger
that
he
will
but
he
s
very
feeble
very
feeble
i
noticed
that
he
gave
the
boy
fewer
kisses
than
usual
perhaps
he
was
put
out
because
the
child
was
brought
in
a
earlier
than
the
stated
time
he
don
t
like
changes
you
know
that
roger
he
don
t
like
changes
i
hardly
dared
to
tell
him
that
the
servants
were
all
going
out
in
a
bunch
i
m
sorry
muttered
roger
but
he
ll
forget
it
by
i
couldn
t
bear
to
keep
a
single
one
from
the
concert
they
ll
be
back
in
good
season
and
meantime
we
have
you
abram
is
worth
half
a
dozen
of
them
miss
strange
we
shall
miss
thank
you
roger
thank
you
faltered
the
old
man
i
try
to
do
my
and
with
another
wistful
glance
at
violet
who
looked
very
sweet
and
youthful
in
the
he
pottered
away
the
silence
which
followed
his
departure
was
as
painful
to
her
as
to
roger
upjohn
when
she
broke
it
it
was
with
this
decisive
remark
that
man
must
not
speak
of
me
to
your
father
he
must
not
even
mention
that
you
have
a
guest
run
after
him
and
tell
him
so
it
is
necessary
that
your
father
s
mind
should
not
be
taken
up
with
present
happenings
roger
made
haste
to
obey
her
when
he
came
back
she
was
on
the
point
of
joining
her
brother
but
stopped
to
utter
a
final
injunction
i
shall
leave
the
library
or
wherever
we
may
be
sitting
just
as
the
clock
strikes
eight
arthur
will
do
the
same
as
by
that
time
he
will
feel
like
smoking
on
the
terrace
do
not
follow
either
him
or
myself
but
take
your
stand
here
on
the
piazza
where
you
can
get
a
full
view
of
the
wing
without
attracting
any
attention
to
yourself
when
you
hear
the
big
clock
in
the
hall
strike
nine
look
up
quickly
at
your
father
s
window
what
you
see
may
determine
oh
arthur
still
admiring
the
prospect
i
do
not
wonder
but
i
find
it
chilly
let
us
go
roger
upjohn
sitting
by
himself
in
the
library
was
watching
the
hands
of
the
mantel
clock
slowly
approaching
the
hour
of
nine
never
had
silence
seemed
more
oppressive
nor
his
sense
of
loneliness
greater
yet
the
boom
of
the
ocean
was
distinct
to
the
ear
and
human
presence
no
farther
away
than
the
terrace
where
arthur
strange
could
be
seen
smoking
out
his
cigar
in
solitude
the
silence
and
the
loneliness
were
in
roger
s
own
soul
and
in
face
of
the
expected
revelation
which
would
make
or
unmake
his
future
the
desolation
they
wrought
was
measureless
to
cut
his
suspense
short
he
rose
at
length
and
hurried
out
to
the
spot
designated
by
miss
strange
as
the
best
point
from
which
to
keep
watch
upon
his
father
s
window
it
was
at
the
end
of
the
piazza
where
the
honeysuckle
hung
and
the
odour
of
the
blossoms
so
pleasing
to
his
father
overpowered
him
not
only
by
its
sweetness
but
by
the
many
memories
it
called
up
visions
of
that
father
as
he
looked
at
all
stages
of
their
relationship
passed
in
a
bewildering
maze
before
him
he
saw
him
as
he
appeared
to
his
childish
eyes
in
those
early
days
of
confidence
when
the
loss
of
the
mother
cast
them
in
mutual
dependence
upon
each
other
then
a
sterner
picture
of
the
relentless
parent
who
sees
but
one
straight
course
to
success
in
this
world
and
the
next
then
the
teacher
and
the
matured
adviser
and
then
oh
bitter
change
the
man
whose
hopes
he
had
crossed
whose
life
he
had
undone
and
all
for
her
who
now
came
stealing
upon
the
scene
with
her
slim
white
jewelled
hand
forever
lifted
up
between
them
and
she
had
he
ever
seen
her
more
clearly
once
more
the
dainty
figure
stepped
from
beauteous
with
every
grace
that
can
allure
and
finally
destroy
a
man
and
as
he
saw
he
trembled
and
wished
that
these
moments
of
awful
waiting
might
pass
and
the
test
be
over
which
would
lay
bare
his
father
s
heart
and
justify
his
fears
or
dispel
them
forever
but
the
crisis
if
crisis
it
was
was
one
of
his
own
making
and
not
to
be
hastened
or
evaded
with
one
quick
glance
at
his
father
s
window
he
turned
in
his
impatience
towards
the
sea
whose
restless
and
continuous
moaning
had
at
length
struck
his
ear
what
was
in
its
call
that
he
should
thus
sway
towards
it
as
though
drawn
by
some
dread
magnetic
force
he
had
been
born
to
the
dashing
of
its
waves
and
knew
its
every
mood
and
all
the
passion
of
its
song
from
frolicsome
ripple
to
melancholy
dirge
but
there
was
something
odd
and
inexplicable
in
its
effect
upon
his
spirit
as
he
faced
it
at
this
hour
grim
and
implacable
a
sound
rather
than
a
sight
it
seemed
to
hold
within
its
invisible
distances
the
image
of
his
future
fate
what
this
image
was
and
why
he
should
seek
for
it
in
this
impenetrable
void
he
did
not
know
he
felt
himself
held
and
was
struggling
with
this
influence
as
with
an
unknown
enemy
when
there
rang
out
from
the
hall
within
the
preparatory
chimes
for
which
his
ear
was
waiting
and
then
the
nine
slow
strokes
which
signalized
the
moment
when
he
was
to
look
for
his
father
s
presence
at
the
window
had
he
wished
he
could
not
have
forborne
that
look
had
his
eyes
been
closing
in
death
or
so
he
felt
the
trembling
lids
would
have
burst
apart
at
this
call
and
the
revelations
it
promised
and
what
did
he
see
what
did
that
window
hold
for
him
nothing
that
he
might
not
have
seen
there
any
night
at
this
hour
his
father
s
figure
drawn
up
behind
the
panes
in
wistful
contemplation
of
the
night
no
visible
change
in
his
attitude
nothing
forced
or
unusual
in
his
manner
even
the
hand
lifted
to
pull
down
the
shade
moves
with
its
familiar
hesitation
in
a
moment
more
that
shade
will
be
down
and
but
no
the
lifted
hand
falls
back
the
easy
attitude
becomes
strained
fixed
he
is
staring
now
not
merely
gazing
out
upon
the
wastes
of
sky
and
sea
and
roger
following
the
direction
of
his
glance
stares
also
in
breathless
emotion
at
what
those
distances
but
now
so
impenetrable
are
giving
to
the
eye
a
spectre
floating
in
the
air
above
the
promontory
the
spectre
of
a
woman
of
his
wife
clad
as
she
had
been
clad
that
fatal
night
outlined
in
supernatural
light
it
faces
them
with
lifted
arms
showing
the
ends
of
rope
dangling
from
either
wrist
a
sight
awful
to
any
eye
but
to
the
man
of
guilty
heart
ah
it
comes
the
cry
for
which
the
agonized
son
had
been
listening
an
old
man
s
shriek
hoarse
with
the
remorse
of
sleepless
nights
and
days
of
unimaginable
regret
and
foreboding
it
cuts
the
night
it
cuts
its
way
into
his
heart
he
feels
his
senses
failing
him
yet
he
must
glance
once
more
at
the
window
and
see
with
his
last
conscious
look
but
what
is
this
a
change
has
taken
place
in
the
picture
and
he
beholds
not
the
distorted
form
of
his
father
sinking
back
in
shame
and
terror
before
this
visible
image
of
his
secret
sin
but
that
of
another
weak
old
man
falling
to
the
floor
behind
his
back
abram
the
attentive
seemingly
harmless
guardian
of
the
household
abram
who
had
never
spoken
a
word
or
given
a
look
in
any
way
suggestive
of
his
having
played
any
other
part
in
the
hideous
drama
of
their
lives
than
that
of
the
humble
and
sympathetic
servant
the
shock
was
too
great
the
relief
too
absolute
for
credence
he
the
listener
at
the
grotto
he
the
avenger
of
the
family
s
honour
he
the
insurer
of
little
roger
s
continuance
with
the
family
at
a
cost
the
one
who
loved
him
best
would
rather
have
died
himself
than
pay
yes
there
is
no
misdoubting
this
old
servitor
s
attitude
of
abject
appeal
or
the
meaning
of
homer
upjohn
s
joyfully
uplifted
countenance
and
outspreading
arms
the
servant
begs
for
mercy
from
man
and
the
master
is
giving
thanks
to
heaven
why
giving
thanks
has
he
been
the
prey
of
cankering
doubts
also
has
the
father
dreaded
to
discover
that
in
the
son
which
the
son
has
dreaded
to
discover
in
the
father
it
might
easily
be
and
as
roger
recognizes
this
truth
and
the
full
tragedy
of
their
mutual
lives
he
drops
to
his
knees
amid
the
honeysuckles
violet
you
are
a
wonder
but
how
did
you
dare
this
from
arthur
as
the
two
rode
to
the
train
in
the
early
morning
the
answer
came
a
bit
waveringly
i
do
not
know
i
am
astonished
yet
at
my
own
daring
look
at
my
hands
they
have
not
ceased
trembling
since
the
moment
you
threw
the
light
upon
me
on
the
rocks
the
figure
of
old
upjohn
in
the
window
looked
so
arthur
with
a
short
glance
at
the
little
hands
she
held
out
shrugged
his
shoulders
imperceptibly
it
struck
him
that
the
tremulousness
she
complained
of
was
due
more
to
some
parting
word
from
their
young
host
than
from
prolonged
awe
at
her
own
daring
but
he
made
no
remark
to
this
effect
only
observed
abram
has
confessed
his
guilt
i
yes
and
will
die
of
it
the
master
will
bury
the
man
and
not
the
man
the
and
roger
not
the
little
fellow
but
the
father
we
will
not
talk
of
him
said
she
her
eyes
seeking
the
sea
where
the
sun
in
its
rising
was
battling
with
a
troop
of
lowering
clouds
and
slowly
gaining
the
victory
end
of
problem
iv
problem
the
dreaming
lady
and
this
is
all
you
mean
to
tell
me
i
think
you
will
find
it
quite
enough
miss
just
the
address
and
this
advice
that
your
call
be
speedy
distracted
nerves
can
not
violet
across
whose
wonted
piquancy
there
lay
an
indefinable
shadow
eyed
her
employer
with
a
doubtful
air
before
turning
away
toward
the
door
she
had
asked
him
for
a
case
to
investigate
something
she
had
never
done
before
and
she
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
particularize
the
sort
of
case
she
desired
it
must
be
an
interesting
one
she
had
stipulated
but
different
quite
different
from
the
last
one
it
must
not
involve
death
or
any
kind
of
horror
if
you
have
a
case
of
subtlety
without
crime
one
to
engage
my
powers
without
depressing
my
spirits
i
beg
you
to
let
me
have
it
i
i
have
not
felt
quite
like
myself
since
i
came
from
whereupon
without
further
comment
but
with
a
smile
she
did
not
understand
he
had
handed
her
a
small
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
had
scribbled
an
address
she
should
have
felt
satisfied
but
for
some
reason
she
did
not
she
regarded
him
as
capable
of
plunging
her
into
an
affair
quite
the
reverse
of
what
she
felt
herself
in
a
condition
to
undertake
i
should
like
to
know
a
little
more
she
pursued
making
a
move
to
unfold
the
slip
he
had
given
her
but
he
stopped
her
with
a
gesture
read
it
in
your
limousine
said
he
if
you
are
disappointed
then
let
me
know
but
i
think
you
will
find
yourself
quite
ready
for
your
and
my
father
would
approve
if
he
could
be
got
to
approve
the
business
at
all
you
do
not
even
need
to
take
your
brother
with
oh
then
it
s
with
women
only
i
have
to
deal
read
the
address
after
you
are
headed
up
fifth
but
when
with
her
doubts
not
yet
entirely
removed
she
opened
the
small
slip
he
had
given
her
the
number
inside
suggested
nothing
but
the
fact
that
her
destination
lay
somewhere
near
eightieth
street
it
was
therefore
with
the
keenest
surprise
she
beheld
her
motor
stop
before
the
conspicuous
house
of
the
great
financier
whose
late
death
had
so
affected
the
she
had
not
had
any
acquaintance
with
this
man
herself
but
she
knew
his
house
everyone
knew
that
it
was
one
of
the
most
princely
in
the
whole
city
dudley
brooks
had
known
how
to
spend
his
millions
indeed
he
had
known
how
to
do
this
so
well
that
it
was
of
him
her
father
also
a
financier
of
some
note
had
once
said
he
was
the
only
successful
american
he
envied
she
was
expected
that
she
saw
the
instant
the
door
was
opened
this
made
her
entrance
easy
an
entrance
further
brightened
by
the
delightful
glimpse
of
a
child
s
cherubic
face
looking
at
her
from
a
distant
doorway
it
was
an
instantaneous
vision
gone
as
soon
as
seen
but
its
effect
was
to
rob
the
pillared
spaces
of
the
wonderful
hallway
of
some
of
their
chill
and
to
modify
in
some
slight
degree
the
formality
of
a
service
which
demanded
three
men
to
usher
her
into
a
small
not
twenty
feet
from
the
door
of
entrance
left
in
this
secluded
spot
she
had
time
to
ask
herself
what
member
of
the
household
she
would
be
called
upon
to
meet
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
did
not
even
know
of
whom
the
household
consisted
she
was
sure
of
the
fact
that
brooks
had
been
a
widower
for
many
years
before
his
death
but
beyond
that
she
knew
nothing
of
his
domestic
life
his
son
but
was
there
a
son
she
had
never
heard
any
mention
made
of
a
younger
brooks
yet
there
was
certainly
some
one
of
his
connection
who
enjoyed
the
rights
of
an
heir
him
she
must
be
prepared
to
meet
with
a
due
composure
whatever
astonishment
he
might
show
at
the
sight
of
a
slip
of
a
girl
instead
of
the
experienced
detective
he
had
every
right
to
expect
but
when
the
door
opened
to
admit
the
person
she
was
awaiting
the
surprise
was
hers
it
was
a
woman
who
stood
before
her
a
woman
and
an
oddity
yet
in
just
what
her
oddity
lay
violet
found
it
difficult
to
decide
was
it
in
the
smoothness
of
her
white
locks
drawn
carefully
down
over
her
ears
or
in
the
contrast
afforded
by
her
eager
eyes
and
her
weak
and
tremulous
mouth
she
was
dressed
in
the
heaviest
of
mourning
and
very
expensively
but
there
was
that
in
her
bearing
and
expression
which
made
it
impossible
to
believe
that
she
took
any
interest
in
her
garments
or
even
knew
in
which
of
her
dresses
she
had
been
attired
i
am
the
person
you
have
come
here
to
see
she
said
your
name
is
not
unfamiliar
to
me
but
you
may
not
know
mine
it
is
quintard
quintard
i
am
in
difficulty
i
need
assistance
secret
assistance
i
did
not
know
where
to
go
for
it
except
to
a
detective
agency
so
i
telephoned
to
the
first
one
i
saw
advertised
and
and
i
was
told
to
expect
miss
strange
but
i
didn
t
think
it
would
be
you
though
i
suppose
it
s
all
right
you
have
come
here
for
this
purpose
haven
t
you
though
it
does
seem
a
little
queer
certainly
quintard
and
if
you
will
tell
me
my
dear
it
s
just
this
yes
i
will
sit
down
last
week
my
brother
died
you
have
heard
of
him
no
doubt
dudley
brooks
oh
yes
my
father
knew
him
we
all
knew
him
by
reputation
do
not
hurry
quintard
i
have
sent
my
car
away
you
can
take
all
the
time
you
no
no
i
can
not
i
m
in
desperate
haste
he
but
let
me
go
on
with
my
story
my
brother
was
a
widower
with
no
children
to
inherit
that
everybody
knows
but
his
wife
left
behind
her
a
son
by
a
former
husband
and
this
son
of
hers
my
brother
had
in
a
measure
adopted
and
even
made
his
sole
heir
in
a
will
he
drew
up
during
the
lifetime
of
his
wife
but
when
he
found
as
he
very
soon
did
that
this
young
man
was
not
developing
in
a
way
to
meet
such
great
responsibilities
he
made
a
new
will
though
unhappily
without
the
knowledge
of
the
family
or
even
of
his
most
intimate
friends
in
which
he
gave
the
bulk
of
his
great
estate
to
his
nephew
clement
who
has
bettered
the
promise
of
his
youth
and
who
besides
has
children
of
great
beauty
whom
my
brother
had
learned
to
love
and
this
will
this
hoarded
scrap
of
paper
which
means
so
much
to
us
all
is
lost
lost
and
i
here
her
voice
which
had
risen
almost
to
a
scream
sank
to
a
horrified
whisper
am
the
one
who
lost
but
there
s
a
copy
of
it
somewhere
there
is
always
a
copy
oh
but
you
haven
t
heard
all
my
nephew
is
an
invalid
has
been
an
invalid
for
years
that
s
why
so
little
is
known
about
him
he
s
dying
of
consumption
the
doctors
hold
out
no
hope
for
him
and
now
with
the
fear
preying
upon
him
of
leaving
his
wife
and
children
penniless
he
is
wearing
away
so
fast
that
any
hour
may
see
his
end
and
i
have
to
meet
his
eyes
such
pitiful
eyes
and
the
look
in
them
is
killing
me
yet
i
was
not
to
blame
i
could
not
help
oh
miss
strange
she
suddenly
broke
in
with
the
inconsequence
of
extreme
feeling
the
will
is
in
the
house
i
never
carried
it
off
the
floor
where
i
sleep
find
it
find
it
i
pray
or
the
moment
had
come
for
violet
s
soft
touch
for
violet
s
encouraging
word
i
will
try
she
answered
her
quintard
grew
calmer
but
first
the
young
girl
continued
i
must
know
more
about
the
conditions
where
is
this
nephew
of
yours
the
man
who
is
ill
in
this
house
where
he
has
been
for
the
last
eight
was
the
child
his
of
whom
i
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
hall
as
i
came
in
yes
and
i
will
fight
for
that
child
violet
cried
out
impulsively
i
am
sure
his
father
s
cause
is
good
where
is
the
other
claimant
the
one
you
designate
as
carlos
oh
there
s
where
the
trouble
is
carlos
is
on
the
mauretania
and
she
is
due
here
in
a
couple
of
days
he
comes
from
the
east
where
he
has
been
touring
with
his
wife
miss
strange
the
lost
will
must
be
found
before
then
or
the
other
will
be
opened
and
read
and
carlos
made
master
of
this
house
which
would
mean
our
quick
departure
and
clement
s
certain
move
a
sick
man
a
relative
as
low
as
you
say
he
is
oh
no
quintard
no
one
would
do
that
were
the
house
a
cabin
and
its
owners
you
do
not
know
carlos
you
do
not
know
his
wife
we
should
not
be
given
a
week
in
which
to
pack
they
have
no
children
and
they
envy
clement
who
has
our
only
hope
lies
in
discovering
the
paper
which
gives
us
the
right
to
remain
here
in
face
of
all
opposition
that
or
penury
now
you
know
my
and
it
is
trouble
one
from
which
i
shall
make
every
effort
to
relieve
you
but
first
let
me
ask
if
you
are
not
worrying
unnecessarily
about
this
missing
document
if
it
was
drawn
up
by
brooks
s
lawyer
but
it
was
not
that
lady
impetuously
interrupted
his
lawyer
is
carlos
s
near
relative
and
has
never
been
told
of
the
change
in
my
brother
s
intentions
clement
i
am
speaking
now
of
my
brother
and
not
of
my
nephew
was
a
great
but
when
it
came
to
standing
up
for
his
rights
in
domestic
matters
he
was
more
timid
than
a
child
he
was
subject
to
his
wife
while
she
lived
and
when
she
was
gone
to
her
relatives
who
are
all
of
a
dominating
character
when
he
finally
made
up
his
mind
to
do
us
justice
and
eliminate
carlos
he
went
out
of
town
i
wish
i
could
remember
where
and
had
this
will
drawn
up
by
a
stranger
whose
name
i
can
not
her
shaking
tones
her
nervous
manner
betrayed
a
weakness
equalling
if
not
surpassing
that
of
the
brother
who
dared
in
secret
what
he
had
not
strength
to
acknowledge
openly
and
it
was
with
some
hesitation
violet
prepared
to
ask
those
definite
questions
which
would
elucidate
the
cause
and
manner
of
a
loss
seemingly
so
important
she
dreaded
to
hear
some
commonplace
tale
of
inexcusable
carelessness
something
subtler
than
this
the
presence
of
some
unsuspected
agency
opposed
to
young
clement
s
interest
some
partisan
of
carlos
some
secret
undermining
force
in
a
house
full
of
servants
and
dependants
seemed
necessary
for
the
development
of
so
ordinary
a
situation
into
a
drama
justifying
the
exercise
of
her
special
powers
i
think
i
understand
now
your
exact
position
in
the
house
as
well
as
the
value
of
the
paper
which
you
say
you
have
lost
the
next
thing
for
me
to
hear
is
how
you
came
to
have
charge
of
this
paper
and
under
what
circumstances
you
were
led
to
mislay
it
do
you
not
feel
quite
ready
to
tell
me
is
is
that
necessary
quintard
faltered
very
replied
violet
watching
her
curiously
i
didn
t
expect
that
is
i
hoped
you
would
be
able
to
point
out
by
some
power
we
can
not
of
course
explain
just
the
spot
where
the
paper
lies
without
having
to
tell
all
that
some
people
can
you
ah
i
understand
you
regarded
me
as
unfit
for
practical
work
and
so
credited
me
with
occult
powers
but
that
is
where
you
made
a
mistake
quintard
i
m
nothing
if
not
practical
and
let
me
add
that
i
m
as
secret
as
the
grave
concerning
what
my
clients
tell
me
if
i
am
to
be
of
any
help
to
you
i
must
be
made
acquainted
with
every
fact
involved
in
the
loss
of
this
valuable
paper
relate
the
whole
circumstance
or
dismiss
me
from
the
case
you
can
have
done
nothing
more
foolish
or
wrong
than
many
oh
don
t
say
things
like
that
broke
in
the
poor
woman
in
a
tone
of
great
indignation
i
have
done
nothing
anyone
could
call
either
foolish
or
wicked
i
am
simply
very
unfortunate
and
being
sensitive
but
this
isn
t
telling
the
story
i
ll
try
to
make
it
all
clear
but
if
i
do
not
and
show
any
confusion
stop
me
and
help
me
out
with
questions
i
i
oh
where
shall
i
begin
with
your
first
knowledge
of
this
second
thank
you
thank
you
now
i
can
go
on
one
night
shortly
after
my
brother
had
been
given
up
by
the
physicians
i
was
called
to
his
bedside
for
a
confidential
talk
as
he
had
received
that
day
a
very
large
amount
of
money
from
the
bank
i
thought
he
was
going
to
hand
it
over
to
me
for
clement
but
it
was
for
something
much
more
serious
than
this
he
had
summoned
me
when
he
was
quite
sure
that
we
were
alone
and
nobody
anywhere
within
hearing
he
told
me
that
he
had
changed
his
mind
as
to
the
disposal
of
his
property
and
that
it
was
to
clement
and
his
children
and
not
to
carlos
he
was
going
to
leave
this
house
and
the
bulk
of
his
money
that
he
had
had
a
new
will
drawn
up
which
he
showed
me
showed
you
yes
he
made
me
bring
it
to
him
from
the
safe
where
he
kept
it
and
feeble
as
he
was
he
was
so
interested
in
pointing
out
certain
portions
of
it
that
he
lifted
himself
in
bed
and
was
so
strong
and
animated
that
i
thought
he
was
getting
better
but
it
was
a
false
strength
due
to
the
excitement
of
the
moment
as
i
saw
next
day
when
he
suddenly
you
were
saying
that
you
brought
the
will
to
him
from
his
safe
where
was
the
safe
in
the
wall
over
his
head
he
gave
me
the
key
to
open
it
this
key
he
took
from
under
his
pillow
i
had
no
trouble
in
fitting
it
or
in
turning
the
and
what
happened
after
you
looked
at
the
will
i
put
it
back
he
told
me
to
but
the
key
i
kept
he
said
i
was
not
to
part
with
it
again
till
the
time
came
for
me
to
produce
the
and
when
was
that
to
be
immediately
after
the
funeral
if
it
so
happened
that
carlos
had
arrived
in
time
to
attend
it
but
if
for
any
reason
he
failed
to
be
here
i
was
to
let
it
lie
till
within
three
days
of
his
return
when
i
was
to
take
it
out
in
the
presence
of
a
delahunt
who
was
to
have
full
charge
of
it
from
that
time
oh
i
remember
all
that
well
enough
and
i
meant
most
earnestly
to
carry
out
his
wishes
but
go
on
quintard
pray
go
on
what
happened
why
couldn
t
you
do
what
he
asked
because
the
will
was
gone
when
i
went
to
take
it
out
there
was
nothing
to
show
delahunt
but
the
empty
oh
a
theft
just
a
common
theft
someone
overheard
the
talk
you
had
with
your
brother
but
how
about
the
key
you
had
that
yes
i
had
then
it
was
taken
from
you
and
returned
you
must
have
been
careless
as
to
where
you
kept
it
no
i
wore
it
on
a
chain
about
my
neck
though
i
had
no
reason
to
mistrust
any
one
in
the
house
i
felt
that
i
could
not
guard
this
key
too
carefully
i
even
kept
it
on
at
night
in
fact
it
never
left
me
it
was
still
on
my
person
when
i
went
into
the
room
with
delahunt
but
the
safe
had
been
opened
for
all
there
were
two
keys
to
it
then
no
in
giving
me
the
key
my
brother
had
strictly
warned
me
not
to
lose
it
as
it
had
no
mrs
quintard
have
you
a
special
confidant
or
maid
yes
my
how
much
did
she
know
about
this
key
nothing
but
that
it
didn
t
help
the
fit
of
my
dress
hetty
has
cared
for
me
for
years
there
s
no
more
devoted
woman
in
all
new
york
nor
one
who
can
be
more
relied
upon
to
tell
the
truth
she
is
so
honest
with
her
tongue
that
i
am
bound
to
believe
her
even
when
she
says
what
that
it
was
i
and
nobody
else
who
took
the
will
out
of
the
safe
last
night
that
she
saw
me
come
from
my
brother
s
room
with
a
folded
paper
in
my
hand
pass
with
it
into
the
library
and
come
out
again
without
it
if
this
is
so
then
that
will
is
somewhere
in
that
great
room
but
we
ve
looked
in
every
conceivable
place
except
the
shelves
where
it
is
useless
to
search
it
would
take
days
to
go
through
them
all
and
meanwhile
carlos
we
will
not
wait
for
carlos
we
will
begin
work
at
once
but
just
one
other
question
how
came
hetty
to
see
you
in
your
walk
through
the
rooms
did
she
follow
you
yes
it
s
it
s
not
the
first
time
i
have
walked
in
my
sleep
last
night
but
she
will
tell
you
it
s
a
painful
subject
to
me
i
will
send
for
her
to
meet
us
in
the
where
you
believe
this
document
to
lie
hidden
i
am
anxious
to
see
the
room
it
is
upstairs
i
she
had
risen
and
was
moving
rapidly
toward
the
door
violet
eagerly
followed
her
let
us
accompany
her
in
her
passage
up
the
palatial
stairway
and
realize
the
effect
upon
her
of
a
splendour
whose
future
ownership
possibly
depended
entirely
upon
herself
it
was
a
cold
splendour
the
merry
voices
of
children
were
lacking
in
these
great
halls
death
past
and
to
come
infused
the
air
with
solemnity
and
mocked
the
pomp
which
yet
appeared
so
much
a
part
of
the
life
here
that
one
could
hardly
imagine
the
huge
pillared
spaces
without
it
to
violet
more
or
less
accustomed
to
fine
interiors
the
chief
interest
of
this
one
lay
in
its
connection
with
the
mystery
then
occupying
her
stopping
for
a
moment
on
the
stair
she
inquired
of
quintard
if
the
loss
she
so
deplored
had
been
made
known
to
the
servants
and
was
much
relieved
to
find
that
with
the
exception
of
delahunt
she
had
not
spoken
of
it
to
any
one
but
clement
and
he
will
never
mention
it
she
declared
not
even
to
his
wife
she
has
troubles
enough
to
bear
without
knowing
how
near
she
stood
to
a
oh
she
will
have
her
fortune
violet
confidently
replied
in
time
the
lawyer
who
drew
up
the
will
will
appear
but
what
you
want
is
an
immediate
triumph
over
the
cold
carlos
and
i
hope
you
may
have
it
ah
this
expletive
was
a
sigh
of
sheer
surprise
quintard
had
unlocked
the
library
door
and
violet
had
been
given
her
first
glimpse
of
this
the
finest
room
in
new
york
she
remembered
now
that
she
had
often
heard
it
so
characterized
and
indeed
had
it
been
taken
bodily
from
some
historic
abbey
of
the
old
world
it
could
not
have
expressed
more
fully
in
structure
and
ornamentation
the
gothic
idea
at
its
best
all
that
it
lacked
were
the
associations
of
vanished
centuries
and
these
in
a
measure
were
supplied
to
the
imagination
by
the
studied
mellowness
of
its
tints
and
the
suggestion
of
age
in
its
carvings
so
much
for
the
room
itself
which
was
but
a
shell
for
holding
the
great
treasure
of
valuable
books
ranged
along
every
shelf
as
violet
s
eyes
sped
over
their
ranks
and
thence
to
the
five
windows
of
deeply
stained
glass
which
faced
her
from
the
southern
end
quintard
indignantly
exclaimed
and
carlos
would
turn
this
into
a
billiard
room
i
do
not
like
carlos
violet
returned
hotly
then
remembering
herself
hastened
to
ask
whether
quintard
was
quite
positive
as
to
this
room
being
the
one
in
which
she
had
hidden
the
precious
document
you
had
better
talk
to
hetty
said
that
lady
as
a
stout
woman
of
most
prepossessing
appearance
entered
their
presence
and
paused
respectfully
just
inside
the
doorway
hetty
you
will
answer
any
questions
this
young
lady
may
put
if
anyone
can
help
us
she
can
but
first
what
news
from
the
nothing
good
the
doctor
has
just
come
for
the
third
time
today
brooks
is
crying
and
even
the
children
are
dumb
with
i
will
go
i
must
see
the
doctor
i
must
tell
him
to
keep
clement
alive
by
any
means
till
she
did
not
wait
to
say
what
but
violet
understood
and
felt
her
heart
grow
heavy
could
it
be
that
her
employer
considered
this
the
gay
and
easy
task
she
had
asked
for
the
next
minute
she
was
putting
her
first
question
hetty
what
did
you
see
in
quintard
s
action
last
night
to
make
you
infer
that
she
left
the
missing
document
in
this
room
the
woman
s
eyes
which
had
been
respectfully
studying
her
face
brightened
with
a
relief
which
made
her
communicative
with
the
of
a
perfectly
candid
nature
she
inquiringly
remarked
my
mistress
has
spoken
of
her
infirmity
yes
and
very
she
walks
in
her
so
she
and
sometimes
when
others
are
asleep
and
she
is
she
did
not
tell
me
she
is
a
very
nervous
woman
and
can
not
always
keep
still
when
she
rouses
up
at
night
when
i
hear
her
rise
i
get
up
too
but
never
being
quite
sure
whether
she
is
sleeping
or
not
i
am
careful
to
follow
her
at
a
certain
distance
last
night
i
was
so
far
behind
her
that
she
had
been
to
her
brother
s
room
and
left
it
before
i
saw
her
where
is
his
room
and
where
is
hers
hers
is
in
front
on
this
same
floor
brooks
s
is
in
the
rear
and
can
be
reached
either
by
the
hall
or
by
passing
through
this
room
into
a
small
one
beyond
which
we
called
his
describe
your
encounter
where
were
you
standing
when
you
saw
her
first
in
the
den
i
have
just
mentioned
there
was
a
bright
light
in
the
hall
behind
me
and
i
could
see
her
figure
quite
plainly
she
was
holding
a
folded
paper
clenched
against
her
breast
and
her
movement
was
so
mechanical
that
i
was
sure
she
was
asleep
she
was
coming
this
way
and
in
another
moment
she
entered
this
room
the
door
which
had
been
open
remained
so
and
in
my
anxiety
i
crept
to
it
and
looked
in
after
her
there
was
no
light
burning
here
at
that
hour
but
the
moon
was
shining
in
in
long
rays
of
variously
coloured
light
if
i
had
followed
her
but
i
did
not
i
just
stood
and
watched
her
long
enough
to
see
her
pass
through
a
blue
ray
then
through
a
green
one
and
then
into
if
not
through
a
red
one
expecting
her
to
walk
straight
on
and
having
some
fears
of
the
staircase
once
she
got
into
the
hall
i
hurried
around
to
the
door
behind
you
there
to
head
her
off
but
she
had
not
yet
left
this
room
i
waited
and
waited
and
still
she
did
not
come
fearing
some
accident
i
finally
ventured
to
approach
the
door
and
try
it
it
was
locked
this
alarmed
me
she
had
never
locked
herself
in
anywhere
before
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
some
persons
would
have
shouted
her
name
but
i
had
been
warned
against
doing
that
so
i
simply
stood
where
i
was
and
eventually
i
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
and
saw
her
come
out
she
was
still
walking
stiffly
but
her
hands
were
empty
and
hanging
at
her
and
then
she
went
straight
to
her
room
and
i
after
her
i
was
sure
she
was
dead
asleep
by
this
and
she
was
yes
miss
but
still
full
of
what
was
on
her
mind
i
know
this
because
she
stopped
when
she
reached
the
bedside
and
began
fumbling
with
the
waist
of
her
wrapper
it
was
for
the
key
she
was
searching
and
when
her
fingers
encountered
it
hanging
on
the
outside
she
opened
her
wrapper
and
thrust
it
in
on
her
bare
you
saw
her
do
all
that
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
now
the
light
in
her
room
was
burning
and
after
that
she
got
into
bed
it
was
i
who
turned
off
the
has
that
wrapper
of
hers
a
pocket
no
nor
her
gown
no
so
she
could
not
have
brought
the
paper
into
her
room
concealed
about
her
person
no
miss
she
left
it
here
it
never
passed
beyond
this
but
might
she
not
have
carried
it
back
to
some
place
of
concealment
in
the
rooms
she
had
left
the
woman
s
face
changed
and
a
slight
flush
showed
through
the
natural
brown
of
her
cheeks
no
she
disclaimed
she
could
not
have
done
that
i
was
careful
to
lock
the
library
door
behind
her
before
i
ran
out
into
the
then
concluded
violet
with
all
the
emphasis
of
conviction
it
is
here
and
nowhere
else
we
must
look
for
that
document
till
we
find
thus
assured
of
the
first
step
in
the
task
she
had
before
her
miss
strange
settled
down
to
business
the
room
which
towered
to
the
height
of
two
stories
was
in
the
shape
of
a
huge
oval
this
oval
separated
into
narrow
divisions
for
the
purpose
of
accommodating
the
shelves
with
which
it
was
lined
narrowed
as
it
rose
above
the
great
gothic
and
the
five
gorgeous
windows
looking
towards
the
south
till
it
met
and
was
lost
in
the
tracery
of
the
ceiling
which
was
of
that
exquisite
and
order
which
we
see
in
the
henry
vii
chapel
in
westminster
abbey
what
break
otherwise
occurred
in
the
circling
round
of
books
reaching
thus
thirty
feet
or
more
above
the
head
was
made
by
the
two
doors
already
spoken
of
and
a
narrow
strip
of
wall
at
either
end
of
the
space
occupied
by
the
windows
no
furniture
was
to
be
seen
there
except
a
couple
of
stalls
taken
from
some
old
cathedral
which
stood
in
the
two
bare
places
just
mentioned
but
within
on
the
extensive
several
articles
were
grouped
and
violet
recognizing
the
possibilities
which
any
one
of
them
afforded
for
the
concealment
of
so
small
an
object
as
a
folded
document
decided
to
use
method
in
her
search
and
to
that
end
mentally
divided
the
space
before
her
into
four
segments
the
first
took
in
the
door
communicating
with
the
suite
ending
in
brooks
s
bedroom
a
diagram
of
this
segment
will
show
that
the
only
article
of
furniture
in
it
was
a
cabinet
it
was
at
this
cabinet
miss
strange
made
her
first
stop
you
have
looked
this
well
through
she
asked
as
she
bent
over
the
glass
case
on
top
to
examine
the
row
of
mediaeval
missals
displayed
within
in
a
manner
to
show
their
wonderful
illuminations
not
the
case
explained
hetty
it
is
locked
you
see
and
no
one
has
as
yet
succeeded
in
finding
the
key
but
we
searched
the
drawers
underneath
with
the
greatest
care
had
we
sifted
the
whole
contents
through
our
fingers
i
could
not
be
more
certain
that
the
paper
is
not
violet
stepped
into
the
next
segment
this
was
the
one
dominated
by
the
huge
a
rug
lay
before
the
hearth
to
this
violet
pointed
quickly
the
woman
answered
we
not
only
lifted
it
but
turned
it
and
that
box
at
the
right
is
full
of
wood
and
wood
did
you
take
out
this
wood
every
and
those
ashes
in
the
something
has
been
burned
yes
but
not
lately
besides
those
ashes
are
all
wood
ashes
if
the
least
bit
of
charred
paper
had
been
mixed
with
them
we
should
have
considered
the
matter
settled
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
that
no
such
particle
can
be
while
saying
this
she
had
put
the
poker
into
violet
s
hand
rake
them
about
miss
and
make
violet
did
so
with
the
result
that
the
poker
was
soon
put
back
into
place
and
she
herself
down
on
her
knees
looking
up
the
chimney
had
she
thrust
it
up
there
hetty
made
haste
to
remark
there
would
have
been
some
signs
of
soot
on
her
sleeves
they
are
white
and
very
long
and
are
always
getting
in
her
way
when
she
tries
to
do
violet
left
the
after
a
glance
at
the
on
which
nothing
stood
but
a
casket
of
open
fretwork
and
two
coloured
photographs
mounted
on
small
easels
the
casket
was
too
open
to
conceal
anything
and
the
photographs
lifted
too
high
above
the
shelf
for
even
the
smallest
paper
let
alone
a
document
of
any
size
to
hide
behind
them
the
chairs
of
which
there
were
several
in
this
part
of
the
room
she
passed
with
just
an
inquiring
look
they
were
all
of
solid
oak
without
any
attempt
at
upholstery
and
although
carved
to
match
the
stalls
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
offered
no
place
for
search
her
delay
in
the
third
segment
was
brief
here
there
was
absolutely
nothing
but
the
door
by
which
she
had
entered
and
the
books
as
she
flitted
on
following
the
oval
of
the
wall
a
small
frown
appeared
on
her
usually
smooth
forehead
she
felt
the
oppression
of
the
books
the
countless
books
if
indeed
she
should
find
herself
obliged
to
go
through
them
what
a
hopeless
outlook
but
she
had
still
a
segment
to
consider
and
after
that
the
immense
table
occupying
the
centre
of
the
room
a
table
which
in
its
double
capacity
for
it
was
as
much
desk
as
table
gave
more
promise
of
holding
the
solution
of
the
mystery
than
anything
to
which
she
had
hitherto
given
her
attention
the
quarter
in
which
she
now
stood
was
the
most
beautiful
and
possibly
the
most
precious
of
them
all
in
it
blazed
the
five
great
windows
which
were
the
glory
of
the
room
but
there
are
no
in
windows
and
much
as
she
revelled
in
colour
she
dared
not
waste
a
moment
on
them
there
was
more
hope
for
her
in
the
towering
stalls
with
their
possible
drawers
for
books
but
hetty
was
before
her
in
the
attempt
she
made
to
lift
the
lids
of
the
two
great
seats
nothing
in
either
said
she
and
violet
with
a
sigh
turned
towards
the
table
this
was
an
immense
affair
made
to
accommodate
itself
to
the
shape
of
the
room
but
with
a
space
on
the
large
enough
to
hold
a
chair
for
the
sitter
who
would
use
its
top
as
a
desk
on
it
were
various
articles
suitable
to
its
double
use
without
being
crowded
it
displayed
a
pile
of
magazines
and
pamphlets
boxes
for
stationery
a
writing
pad
with
its
accompaniments
a
lamp
and
some
few
ornaments
among
which
was
a
large
box
richly
inlaid
with
pearl
and
ivory
the
lid
of
which
stood
wide
open
don
t
touch
admonished
violet
as
hetty
stretched
out
her
hand
to
move
some
little
object
aside
you
have
already
worked
here
busily
in
the
search
you
made
this
we
handled
did
you
go
through
these
pamphlets
we
shook
open
each
one
we
were
especially
particular
here
since
it
was
at
this
table
i
saw
quintard
with
head
level
or
drooped
like
one
looking
down
rather
than
up
or
around
yes
a
ray
of
red
light
shone
on
her
sleeve
it
seemed
to
me
the
sleeve
moved
as
though
she
were
reaching
will
you
try
to
stand
as
she
did
and
as
nearly
in
the
same
place
as
possible
hetty
glanced
down
at
the
table
edge
marked
where
the
gules
dominated
the
blue
and
green
and
moved
to
that
spot
and
paused
with
her
head
sinking
slowly
towards
her
breast
very
good
exclaimed
violet
but
the
moon
was
probably
in
a
very
different
position
from
what
the
sun
is
you
are
right
it
was
higher
up
i
chanced
to
notice
let
me
come
said
violet
hetty
moved
and
violet
took
her
place
but
in
a
spot
a
step
or
two
farther
front
this
brought
her
very
near
to
the
centre
of
the
table
hanging
her
head
just
as
hetty
had
done
she
reached
out
her
right
hand
have
you
looked
under
this
blotter
she
asked
pointing
towards
the
pad
she
touched
i
mean
between
the
blotter
and
the
frame
which
holds
it
i
certainly
did
answered
hetty
with
some
pride
violet
remained
staring
down
then
you
took
off
everything
that
was
lying
on
it
oh
violet
continued
to
stare
down
at
the
blotter
then
impetuously
put
them
back
in
their
accustomed
hetty
obeyed
violet
continued
to
look
at
them
then
slowly
stretched
out
her
hand
but
soon
let
it
fall
again
with
an
air
of
discouragement
certainly
the
missing
document
was
not
in
the
or
the
mucilage
bottle
yet
something
made
her
stoop
again
over
the
pad
and
subject
it
to
the
closest
scrutiny
if
only
nothing
had
been
touched
she
inwardly
sighed
but
she
let
no
sign
of
her
discontent
escape
her
lips
simply
exclaiming
as
she
glanced
up
at
the
towering
spaces
overhead
the
books
the
books
nothing
remains
but
for
you
to
call
up
all
the
servants
or
get
men
from
the
outside
and
beginning
at
one
end
i
should
say
the
upper
one
take
down
every
book
standing
within
reach
of
a
woman
of
quintard
s
hear
first
what
quintard
has
to
say
about
that
interrupted
the
woman
as
that
lady
entered
in
a
flutter
of
emotion
springing
from
more
than
one
cause
the
young
lady
thinks
that
we
should
remove
the
books
hetty
observed
as
her
mistress
s
eye
wandered
to
hers
from
violet
s
abstracted
countenance
useless
if
we
were
to
undertake
to
do
that
carlos
would
be
here
before
half
the
job
was
finished
besides
hetty
must
have
told
you
my
extreme
aversion
to
nicely
bound
books
i
will
not
say
that
when
awake
i
never
place
my
hand
on
one
but
once
in
a
state
of
somnambulism
when
every
natural
whim
has
full
control
i
am
sure
that
i
never
would
there
is
a
reason
for
my
prejudice
i
was
not
always
rich
i
once
was
very
poor
it
was
when
i
was
first
married
and
long
before
clement
had
begun
to
make
his
fortune
i
was
so
poor
then
that
frequently
i
went
hungry
and
what
was
worse
saw
my
little
daughter
cry
for
food
and
why
because
my
husband
was
a
bibliomaniac
he
would
spend
on
fine
editions
what
would
have
kept
the
family
comfortable
it
is
hard
to
believe
isn
t
it
i
have
seen
him
bring
home
a
grolier
when
the
larder
was
as
empty
as
that
box
and
it
made
me
hate
books
so
especially
those
of
extra
fine
binding
that
i
have
to
tear
the
covers
off
before
i
can
find
courage
to
read
o
life
life
how
fast
violet
was
learning
it
i
can
understand
your
idea
quintard
but
as
everything
else
has
failed
i
should
make
a
mistake
not
to
examine
these
shelves
it
is
just
possible
that
we
may
be
able
to
shorten
the
task
very
materially
that
we
may
not
have
to
call
in
help
even
to
what
extent
have
they
been
approached
or
the
books
handled
since
you
discovered
the
loss
of
the
paper
we
are
looking
for
not
at
all
neither
of
us
went
near
this
from
hetty
nor
any
one
else
no
one
else
has
been
admitted
to
the
room
we
locked
both
doors
the
moment
we
felt
satisfied
that
the
will
had
been
left
that
s
a
relief
now
i
may
be
able
to
do
something
hetty
you
look
like
a
very
strong
woman
and
i
as
you
see
am
very
little
would
you
mind
lifting
me
up
to
these
shelves
i
want
to
look
at
them
not
at
the
books
but
at
the
shelves
the
wondering
woman
stooped
and
raised
her
to
the
level
of
the
shelf
she
had
pointed
out
violet
peered
closely
at
it
and
then
at
the
ones
just
beneath
am
i
heavy
she
asked
if
not
let
me
see
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
hetty
carried
her
over
violet
inspected
each
shelf
as
high
as
a
woman
of
quintard
s
stature
could
reach
and
when
on
her
feet
again
knelt
to
inspect
the
ones
below
no
one
has
touched
or
drawn
anything
from
these
shelves
in
hours
she
declared
the
small
accumulation
of
dust
along
their
edges
has
not
been
disturbed
at
any
point
it
was
very
different
with
the
that
shows
very
plainly
where
you
had
moved
things
and
where
you
had
was
that
what
you
were
looking
for
well
i
never
violet
paid
no
heed
she
was
thinking
and
thinking
very
deeply
hetty
turned
towards
her
mistress
then
quickly
back
to
violet
whom
she
seized
by
the
arm
what
s
the
matter
with
quintard
she
hurriedly
asked
if
it
were
night
i
should
think
that
she
was
in
one
of
her
violet
started
and
glanced
where
hetty
pointed
quintard
was
within
a
few
feet
of
them
but
as
oblivious
of
their
presence
as
though
she
stood
alone
in
the
room
possibly
she
thought
she
did
with
fixed
eyes
and
mechanical
step
she
began
to
move
straight
towards
the
table
her
whole
appearance
of
a
nature
to
make
hetty
s
blood
run
cold
but
to
cause
that
of
violet
s
to
bound
through
her
veins
with
renewed
hope
the
one
thing
i
could
have
wished
she
murmured
under
her
breath
she
has
fallen
into
a
trance
she
is
again
under
the
dominion
of
her
idea
if
we
watch
and
do
not
disturb
her
she
may
repeat
her
action
of
last
night
and
herself
show
where
she
has
put
this
precious
meanwhile
quintard
continued
to
advance
a
moment
more
and
her
smooth
white
locks
caught
the
ruddy
glow
centred
upon
the
chair
standing
in
the
hollow
of
the
table
words
were
leaving
her
lips
and
her
hand
reaching
out
over
the
blotter
groped
among
the
articles
scattered
there
till
it
settled
on
a
large
pair
of
shears
listen
muttered
violet
to
the
woman
pressing
close
to
her
side
you
are
acquainted
with
her
voice
catch
what
she
says
if
you
hetty
could
not
an
undistinguishable
murmur
was
all
that
came
to
her
ears
violet
took
a
step
nearer
quintard
s
hand
had
left
the
shears
and
was
hovering
uncertainly
in
the
air
her
distress
was
evident
her
head
no
longer
steady
on
her
shoulders
was
turning
this
way
and
that
and
her
tones
becoming
inarticulate
paper
i
want
paper
burst
from
her
lips
in
a
shrill
unnatural
cry
but
when
they
listened
for
more
and
watched
to
see
the
uncertain
hand
settle
somewhere
she
suddenly
came
to
herself
and
turned
upon
them
a
startled
glance
which
speedily
changed
into
one
of
the
utmost
perplexity
what
am
i
doing
here
she
asked
i
have
a
feeling
as
if
i
had
almost
seen
almost
touched
oh
it
s
gone
and
all
is
blank
again
why
couldn
t
i
keep
it
till
i
knew
then
she
came
wholly
to
herself
and
forgetting
even
the
doubts
of
a
moment
since
remarked
to
violet
in
her
old
tremulous
fashion
you
asked
us
to
pull
down
the
books
but
you
ve
evidently
thought
better
of
yes
i
have
thought
better
of
then
with
a
last
desperate
hope
of
the
visions
lying
somewhere
back
in
quintard
s
troubled
brain
violet
ventured
to
observe
this
is
likely
to
resolve
itself
into
a
psychological
problem
quintard
do
you
suppose
that
if
you
fell
again
into
the
condition
of
last
night
you
would
repeat
your
action
and
so
lead
us
yourself
to
where
the
will
lies
hidden
possibly
but
it
may
be
weeks
before
i
walk
again
in
my
sleep
and
meanwhile
carlos
will
have
arrived
and
clement
possibly
died
my
nephew
is
so
low
that
the
doctor
is
coming
back
at
midnight
miss
strange
clement
is
a
man
in
a
thousand
he
says
he
wants
to
see
you
would
you
be
willing
to
accompany
me
to
his
room
for
a
moment
he
will
not
make
many
more
requests
and
i
will
take
care
that
the
interview
is
not
i
will
go
willingly
but
would
it
not
be
better
to
wait
then
you
may
never
see
him
at
very
well
but
i
wish
i
had
some
better
news
to
that
will
come
later
this
house
was
never
meant
for
carlos
hetty
you
will
stay
here
miss
strange
let
us
go
you
need
not
speak
just
let
him
see
violet
nodded
and
followed
quintard
into
the
the
sight
which
met
her
eyes
tried
her
young
emotions
deeply
staring
at
her
from
the
bed
she
saw
two
piercing
eyes
over
whose
brilliance
death
as
yet
had
gained
no
control
clements
s
soul
was
in
that
gaze
clement
halting
at
the
brink
of
dissolution
to
sound
the
depths
behind
him
for
the
hope
which
would
make
departure
easy
would
he
see
in
her
a
mere
slip
of
a
girl
dressed
in
fashionable
clothes
and
bearing
about
her
all
the
marks
of
social
distinction
the
sort
of
person
needed
for
the
task
upon
the
success
of
which
depended
his
darlings
future
she
could
hardly
expect
it
yet
as
she
continued
to
meet
his
gaze
with
all
the
seriousness
the
moment
demanded
she
beheld
those
burning
orbs
lose
some
of
their
demand
and
the
fingers
which
had
lain
inert
upon
the
bedspread
flutter
gently
and
move
as
if
to
draw
attention
to
his
wife
and
the
three
beautiful
children
clustered
at
the
he
had
not
spoken
nor
could
she
speak
but
the
solemnity
with
which
she
raised
her
right
hand
as
to
a
listening
heaven
called
forth
upon
his
lips
what
was
possibly
his
last
smile
and
with
the
memory
of
this
faint
expression
of
confidence
on
his
part
she
left
the
room
to
make
her
final
attempt
to
solve
the
mystery
of
the
missing
document
facing
the
elderly
lady
in
the
hall
she
addressed
her
with
the
force
and
soberness
of
one
leading
a
forlorn
hope
i
want
you
to
concentrate
your
mind
upon
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
do
you
think
you
can
do
this
i
will
try
replied
the
poor
woman
with
a
backward
glance
at
the
door
which
had
just
been
closed
upon
her
what
we
want
said
she
is
as
i
stated
before
an
insight
into
the
workings
of
your
brain
at
the
time
you
took
the
will
from
the
safe
try
and
follow
what
i
have
to
say
quintard
dreams
are
no
longer
regarded
by
scientists
as
prophecies
of
the
future
or
even
as
spontaneous
and
irrelevant
conditions
of
thought
but
as
reflections
of
a
near
past
which
can
almost
without
exception
be
traced
back
to
the
occurrences
which
caused
them
your
action
with
the
will
had
its
birth
in
some
previous
line
of
thought
afterwards
forgotten
let
us
try
and
find
that
thought
recall
if
you
can
just
what
you
did
or
read
quintard
looked
frightened
but
i
have
no
memory
she
objected
i
forget
quickly
so
quickly
that
in
order
to
fulfill
my
engagements
i
have
to
keep
a
memorandum
of
every
day
s
events
yesterday
yesterday
what
did
i
do
yesterday
i
went
downtown
for
one
thing
but
i
hardly
know
perhaps
your
memorandum
of
yesterday
s
doings
will
help
i
will
get
it
but
it
won
t
give
you
the
least
help
i
keep
it
only
for
my
own
eye
and
never
mind
let
me
see
and
she
waited
impatiently
for
it
to
be
put
in
her
hands
but
when
she
came
to
read
the
record
of
the
last
two
days
this
was
all
she
found
saturday
mauretania
nearly
due
i
must
let
delahunt
know
today
that
he
s
wanted
here
hetty
will
try
on
my
dresses
says
she
has
to
alter
them
peabody
came
to
lunch
and
we
in
such
trouble
had
to
go
down
street
errand
for
clement
the
will
the
will
i
think
of
nothing
else
is
it
safe
where
it
is
no
peace
of
mind
till
clement
better
this
afternoon
says
he
must
live
till
carlos
gets
back
not
to
triumph
over
him
but
to
do
what
he
can
to
lessen
his
disappointment
my
good
clement
so
nervous
i
went
to
pasting
photographs
and
was
forgetting
all
my
troubles
when
hetty
brought
in
another
dress
to
try
on
quiet
in
the
great
house
during
which
the
clock
on
the
staircase
sent
forth
seven
musical
peals
to
violet
waiting
alone
in
the
library
they
acted
as
a
summons
she
was
just
leaving
the
room
when
the
sound
of
hubbub
in
the
hall
below
held
her
motionless
in
the
doorway
an
automobile
had
stopped
in
front
and
several
persons
were
entering
the
house
in
a
gay
and
unseemly
fashion
as
she
stood
listening
uncertain
of
her
duty
she
perceived
the
frenzied
figure
of
quintard
approaching
as
she
passed
by
she
dropped
one
word
carlos
then
she
went
staggering
on
to
disappear
a
moment
later
down
the
stairway
this
vision
lost
another
came
this
time
it
was
that
of
clements
s
wife
leaning
from
the
marble
balustrade
above
the
shadow
of
approaching
grief
battling
with
the
present
terror
in
her
perfect
features
then
she
too
withdrew
from
view
and
violet
left
for
the
moment
alone
in
the
great
hall
stepped
back
into
the
library
and
began
to
put
on
her
hat
the
lights
had
been
turned
up
in
the
grand
salon
and
it
was
in
this
scene
of
gorgeous
colour
that
quintard
came
face
to
face
with
carlos
pelacios
those
who
were
witness
to
her
entrance
say
that
she
presented
a
noble
appearance
as
with
the
resolution
of
extreme
desperation
she
stood
waiting
for
his
first
angry
attack
he
a
short
dark
man
showing
both
in
features
and
expression
the
spanish
blood
of
his
paternal
ancestors
started
to
address
her
in
tones
of
violence
but
changed
his
note
as
he
met
her
eye
to
one
simply
sardonic
you
here
he
began
i
assure
you
madame
that
it
is
a
pleasure
which
is
not
without
its
inconveniences
did
you
not
receive
my
cablegram
requesting
this
house
to
be
made
ready
for
my
occupancy
i
then
why
do
i
find
guests
here
they
do
not
usually
precede
the
arrival
of
their
clement
is
very
ill
so
much
the
greater
reason
that
he
should
have
been
removed
you
were
not
expected
for
two
days
yet
you
cabled
that
you
were
coming
on
the
yes
i
cabled
that
elisabetta
this
to
his
wife
standing
silently
in
the
background
we
will
go
to
the
plaza
for
tonight
at
three
o
clock
tomorrow
we
shall
expect
to
find
this
house
in
readiness
for
our
return
later
if
quintard
desires
to
visit
us
we
shall
be
pleased
to
receive
her
but
this
to
quintard
herself
you
must
come
without
clement
and
the
quintard
s
rigid
hand
stole
up
to
her
throat
clement
is
dying
he
is
failing
hourly
she
murmured
he
may
not
live
till
even
carlos
was
taken
aback
by
this
oh
well
said
he
we
will
give
you
two
quintard
gasped
then
she
walked
straight
up
to
him
you
will
give
us
all
the
time
his
condition
requires
and
more
much
more
he
is
the
real
owner
of
this
house
not
you
my
brother
left
a
will
bequeathing
it
to
him
you
are
my
nephew
s
guests
and
not
he
yours
as
his
representative
i
entreat
you
and
your
wife
to
remain
here
until
you
can
find
a
home
to
your
the
silence
seethed
carlos
had
a
temper
of
fire
and
so
had
his
wife
but
neither
spoke
till
he
had
gained
sufficient
control
over
himself
to
remark
without
undue
rancour
i
did
not
think
you
had
the
wit
to
influence
your
brother
to
this
extent
otherwise
i
should
have
cut
my
travels
then
harshly
where
is
this
will
it
will
be
but
the
words
faltered
carlos
glanced
at
the
man
standing
behind
his
wife
then
back
at
quintard
wills
are
not
scribbled
off
on
deathbeds
or
if
they
are
it
needs
something
more
than
a
signature
to
legalize
them
i
don
t
believe
in
this
trick
of
a
later
will
cavanagh
here
he
indicated
the
gentleman
accompanying
them
has
done
my
father
s
business
for
years
and
he
assured
me
that
the
paper
he
holds
in
his
pocket
is
the
first
last
and
only
expression
of
your
brother
s
wishes
if
you
are
in
a
position
to
deny
this
show
us
the
document
you
mention
show
us
it
at
once
or
inform
us
where
and
in
whose
hands
it
can
be
that
for
for
reasons
i
can
not
give
i
must
refuse
to
do
at
present
but
i
am
ready
to
swear
a
mocking
laugh
cut
her
short
did
it
issue
from
his
lips
or
from
those
of
his
highstrung
and
unfeeling
wife
it
might
have
come
from
either
there
was
cause
enough
oh
she
faltered
may
god
have
mercy
and
was
sinking
before
their
eyes
when
she
heard
her
name
called
from
the
threshold
and
looking
that
way
saw
hetty
beaming
upon
her
backed
by
a
little
figure
with
a
face
so
radiant
that
instinctively
her
hand
went
out
to
grasp
the
folded
sheet
of
paper
hetty
was
seeking
to
thrust
upon
her
ah
she
cried
in
a
great
voice
you
will
not
have
to
wait
nor
clement
either
here
is
the
will
the
children
have
come
into
their
and
she
fell
at
their
feet
in
a
dead
faint
where
did
you
find
it
oh
where
did
you
find
it
i
have
waited
a
week
to
know
when
after
carlos
s
sudden
departure
i
stood
beside
clement
s
and
saw
from
the
look
he
gave
me
that
he
could
still
feel
and
understand
i
told
him
that
you
had
succeeded
in
your
task
and
that
all
was
well
with
us
but
i
was
not
able
to
tell
him
how
you
had
succeeded
or
in
what
place
the
will
had
been
found
and
he
died
unknowing
but
we
may
know
may
we
not
now
that
he
is
laid
away
and
there
is
no
more
talk
of
our
leaving
this
house
violet
smiled
but
very
tenderly
and
in
a
way
not
to
offend
the
mourner
they
were
sitting
in
the
library
the
great
library
which
was
to
remain
in
clement
s
family
after
all
and
it
amused
her
to
follow
the
dreaming
lady
s
glances
as
they
ran
in
irrepressible
curiosity
over
the
walls
had
violet
wished
she
could
have
kept
her
secret
forever
these
eyes
would
never
have
discovered
it
but
she
was
of
a
sympathetic
temperament
our
violet
so
after
a
moment
s
delay
during
which
she
satisfied
herself
that
little
if
anything
had
been
touched
in
the
room
since
her
departure
from
it
a
week
before
she
quietly
observed
you
were
right
in
persisting
that
you
hid
it
in
this
room
it
was
here
i
found
it
do
you
notice
that
photograph
on
the
mantel
which
does
not
stand
exactly
straight
on
its
easel
supposing
you
take
it
down
you
can
reach
it
can
you
not
oh
yes
but
what
lift
it
down
dear
quintard
and
then
turn
it
round
and
look
at
its
agitated
and
questioning
the
lady
did
as
she
was
bid
and
at
the
first
glance
gave
a
cry
of
surprise
if
not
of
understanding
the
square
of
brown
paper
acting
as
a
backing
to
the
picture
was
slit
across
disclosing
a
similar
one
behind
it
which
was
still
intact
oh
was
it
hidden
in
here
she
asked
very
completely
assented
violet
pasted
in
out
of
sight
by
a
lady
who
amuses
herself
with
mounting
and
framing
photographs
usually
she
is
conscious
of
her
work
but
this
time
she
performed
her
task
in
a
quintard
was
all
amazement
i
don
t
remember
touching
these
pictures
she
declared
i
never
should
have
remembered
you
are
a
wonderful
person
miss
strange
how
came
you
to
think
these
photographs
might
have
two
backings
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
this
was
i
will
tell
you
quintard
you
helped
i
helped
you
yes
you
remember
the
memorandum
you
gave
me
in
it
you
mentioned
pasting
photographs
but
this
was
not
enough
in
itself
to
lead
me
to
examine
those
on
the
mantel
if
you
had
not
given
me
another
suggestion
a
little
while
before
we
did
not
tell
you
this
quintard
at
the
time
but
during
the
search
we
were
making
here
that
day
you
had
a
lapse
into
that
peculiar
state
which
induces
you
to
walk
in
your
sleep
it
was
a
short
one
lasting
but
a
moment
but
in
a
moment
one
can
speak
and
this
you
did
spoke
i
spoke
yes
you
uttered
the
word
paper
not
the
paper
but
paper
and
reached
out
towards
the
shears
though
i
had
not
much
time
to
think
of
it
then
afterwards
upon
reading
your
memorandum
i
recalled
your
words
and
asked
myself
if
it
was
not
paper
to
cut
rather
than
to
hide
you
wanted
if
it
was
to
cut
and
you
were
but
repeating
the
experience
of
the
night
before
then
the
room
should
contain
some
remnants
of
cut
paper
had
we
seen
any
yes
in
the
basket
under
the
desk
we
had
taken
out
and
thrown
back
again
a
strip
or
so
of
wrapping
paper
which
if
my
memory
did
not
fail
me
showed
a
edge
to
pull
this
strip
out
again
and
spread
it
flat
upon
the
desk
was
the
work
of
a
minute
and
what
i
saw
led
me
to
look
all
over
the
room
not
now
for
the
folded
document
but
for
a
square
of
brown
paper
such
as
had
been
taken
out
of
this
larger
sheet
was
i
successful
not
for
a
long
while
but
when
i
came
to
the
photographs
on
the
mantel
and
saw
how
nearly
they
corresponded
in
shape
and
size
to
what
i
was
looking
for
i
recalled
again
your
fancy
for
mounting
photographs
and
felt
that
the
mystery
was
solved
a
glance
at
the
back
of
one
of
them
brought
disappointment
but
when
i
turned
about
its
mate
you
know
what
i
found
underneath
the
outer
paper
you
had
laid
the
will
against
the
original
backing
and
simply
pasted
another
one
over
it
that
the
discovery
came
in
time
to
cut
short
a
very
painful
interview
has
made
me
joyful
for
a
week
and
now
may
i
see
the
children
end
of
problem
v
problem
vi
the
house
of
clocks
miss
strange
was
not
in
a
responsive
mood
this
her
employer
had
observed
on
first
entering
yet
he
showed
no
hesitation
in
laying
on
the
table
behind
which
she
had
ensconced
herself
in
the
attitude
of
one
besieged
an
envelope
thick
with
enclosed
papers
there
said
he
telephone
me
when
you
have
read
i
shall
not
read
no
he
smiled
and
repossessing
himself
of
the
envelope
he
tore
off
one
end
extracted
the
sheets
with
which
it
was
filled
and
laid
them
down
still
unfolded
in
their
former
place
on
the
the
suggestiveness
of
the
action
caused
the
corners
of
miss
srange
s
delicate
lips
to
twitch
wistfully
before
settling
into
an
ironic
smile
calmly
the
other
watched
her
i
am
on
a
vacation
she
loftily
explained
as
she
finally
met
his
studiously
glance
oh
i
know
that
i
am
in
my
own
home
she
petulantly
acknowledged
as
his
gaze
took
in
the
room
and
that
the
automobile
is
at
the
door
and
that
i
m
dressed
for
shopping
but
for
all
that
i
m
on
a
vacation
a
mental
one
she
emphasized
and
business
must
wait
i
haven
t
got
over
the
last
affair
she
protested
as
he
maintained
a
discreet
silence
and
the
season
is
so
gay
just
now
so
many
balls
so
many
but
that
isn
t
the
worst
father
is
beginning
to
wake
up
and
if
he
ever
suspects
a
significant
gesture
ended
this
appeal
the
personage
knew
her
father
everyone
did
and
the
wonder
had
always
been
that
she
dared
run
the
risk
of
displeasing
one
so
implacable
though
she
was
his
favourite
child
peter
strange
was
known
to
be
quite
capable
of
cutting
her
off
with
a
shilling
once
his
close
prejudiced
mind
conceived
it
to
be
his
duty
and
that
he
would
so
interpret
the
situation
if
he
ever
came
to
learn
the
secret
of
his
daughter
s
fits
of
abstraction
and
the
sly
bank
account
she
was
slowly
accumulating
the
personage
holding
out
this
dangerous
lure
had
no
doubt
at
all
yet
he
only
smiled
at
her
words
and
remarked
in
casual
suggestion
it
s
out
of
town
this
time
way
out
your
health
certainly
demands
a
change
of
my
health
is
good
fortunately
or
unfortunately
as
one
may
choose
to
look
at
it
it
furnishes
me
with
no
excuse
for
an
outing
she
steadily
retorted
turning
her
back
on
the
table
ah
excuse
me
the
insidious
voice
apologized
your
paleness
misled
me
surely
a
night
or
two
s
change
might
be
she
gave
him
a
quick
side
look
and
began
to
adjust
her
boa
to
this
hint
he
paid
no
attention
the
affair
is
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
he
pursued
in
the
tone
of
one
rehearsing
a
part
but
there
he
stopped
for
some
reason
not
altogether
apparent
to
the
masculine
mind
the
pin
of
flashing
stones
real
stones
which
held
her
hat
in
place
had
to
be
taken
out
and
thrust
back
again
not
once
but
twice
it
was
to
watch
this
performance
he
had
paused
when
he
was
ready
to
proceed
he
took
the
musing
tone
of
one
marshalling
facts
for
another
s
enlightenment
a
woman
of
unknown
instincts
pshaw
the
end
of
the
pin
would
strike
against
the
comb
holding
violet
s
locks
living
in
a
house
as
mysterious
as
the
secret
it
contains
but
here
he
allowed
his
patience
apparently
to
forsake
him
i
will
bore
you
no
longer
go
to
your
teas
and
balls
i
will
struggle
with
my
dark
affairs
his
hand
went
to
the
packet
of
papers
she
affected
so
ostentatiously
to
despise
he
could
be
as
nonchalant
as
she
but
he
did
not
lift
them
he
let
them
lie
yet
the
young
heiress
had
not
made
a
movement
or
even
turned
the
slightest
glance
his
way
a
woman
difficult
to
understand
a
mysterious
house
possibly
a
mysterious
crime
thus
violet
kept
repeating
in
silent
as
flushed
with
dancing
she
sat
that
evening
in
a
conservatory
dividing
her
attention
between
the
compliments
of
her
partner
and
the
splash
of
a
fountain
bubbling
in
the
heart
of
this
mass
of
tropical
foliage
and
when
some
hours
later
she
sat
down
in
her
bedroom
for
a
few
minutes
thought
before
retiring
it
was
to
draw
from
a
little
oak
box
at
her
elbow
the
or
so
folded
sheets
of
closely
written
paper
which
had
been
left
for
her
perusal
by
her
persistent
employer
glancing
first
at
the
signature
and
finding
it
to
be
one
already
favourably
known
at
the
bar
she
read
with
avidity
the
statement
of
events
thus
vouched
for
finding
them
curious
enough
in
all
conscience
to
keep
her
awake
for
another
full
hour
we
here
subscribe
it
i
am
a
lawyer
with
an
office
in
the
times
square
building
my
business
is
mainly
local
but
sometimes
i
am
called
out
of
town
as
witness
the
following
summons
received
by
me
on
the
fifth
of
last
october
dear
sir
i
wish
to
make
my
will
i
am
an
invalid
and
can
not
leave
my
room
will
you
come
to
me
the
enclosed
reference
will
answer
for
my
respectability
if
it
satisfies
you
and
you
decide
to
accommodate
me
please
hasten
your
visit
i
have
not
many
days
to
live
a
carriage
will
meet
you
at
highland
station
at
any
hour
you
designate
telegraph
reply
postlethwaite
gloom
cottage
j
the
reference
given
was
a
weed
of
street
a
man
of
unimpeachable
reputation
calling
him
up
at
his
business
office
i
asked
him
what
he
could
tell
me
about
postlethwaite
of
gloom
cottage
j
the
answer
astonished
me
there
is
no
postlethwaite
to
be
found
at
that
address
he
died
years
ago
there
is
a
postlethwaite
a
confirmed
paralytic
do
you
mean
her
i
glanced
at
the
letter
still
lying
open
at
the
side
of
the
telephone
the
signature
reads
then
it
s
she
her
name
is
arabella
she
hates
the
name
being
a
woman
of
no
sentiment
uses
her
initials
even
on
her
cheques
what
does
she
want
of
you
to
draw
her
oblige
her
it
ll
be
experience
for
and
he
slammed
home
the
receiver
i
decided
to
follow
the
suggestion
so
forcibly
emphasized
and
the
next
day
saw
me
at
highland
station
a
superannuated
horse
and
a
still
more
superannuated
carriage
awaited
me
both
too
old
to
serve
a
busy
man
in
these
days
of
swift
conveyance
could
this
be
a
sample
of
the
establishment
i
was
about
to
enter
then
i
remembered
that
the
woman
who
had
sent
for
me
was
a
helpless
invalid
and
probably
had
no
use
for
any
sort
of
turnout
the
driver
was
in
keeping
with
the
vehicle
and
as
noncommittal
as
the
plodding
beast
he
drove
if
i
ventured
upon
a
remark
he
gave
me
a
long
and
curious
look
if
i
went
so
far
as
to
attack
him
with
a
direct
question
he
responded
with
a
hitch
of
the
shoulder
or
a
dubious
smile
which
conveyed
nothing
was
he
deaf
or
just
unpleasant
i
soon
learned
that
he
was
not
deaf
for
suddenly
after
a
of
a
mile
or
so
through
a
wooded
road
which
we
had
entered
from
the
main
highway
he
drew
in
his
horse
and
without
glancing
my
way
spoke
his
first
word
this
is
where
you
get
out
the
house
is
back
there
in
the
as
no
house
was
visible
and
the
bushes
rose
in
an
unbroken
barrier
along
the
road
i
stared
at
him
in
some
doubt
of
his
sanity
but
i
began
a
protest
into
which
he
at
once
broke
with
the
sharp
direction
take
the
path
it
ll
lead
you
straight
to
the
front
i
don
t
see
any
for
this
he
had
no
answer
and
confident
from
his
expression
that
it
would
be
useless
to
expect
anything
further
from
him
i
dropped
a
coin
into
his
hand
and
jumped
to
the
ground
he
was
off
before
i
could
turn
myself
about
something
is
rotten
in
the
state
of
denmark
i
quoted
in
startled
comment
to
myself
and
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
stared
down
at
the
turf
at
my
feet
a
bit
of
flagging
met
my
eye
protruding
from
a
layer
of
thick
moss
farther
on
i
espied
another
the
second
probably
of
many
this
no
doubt
was
the
path
i
had
been
bidden
to
follow
and
without
further
thought
on
the
subject
i
plunged
into
the
bushes
which
with
difficulty
i
made
give
way
before
me
for
a
moment
all
further
advance
looked
hopeless
a
more
tangled
uninviting
approach
to
a
home
i
had
never
seen
outside
of
the
tropics
and
the
complete
neglect
thus
displayed
should
have
prepared
me
for
the
appearance
of
the
house
i
unexpectedly
came
upon
just
as
the
way
seemed
on
the
point
of
closing
up
before
me
but
nothing
could
well
prepare
one
for
a
first
view
of
gloom
cottage
its
location
in
a
hollow
which
had
gradually
filled
itself
up
with
trees
and
some
kind
of
prickly
brush
its
deeply
stained
walls
once
picturesque
enough
in
their
grouping
but
too
deeply
hidden
now
amid
rotting
boughs
to
produce
any
other
effect
than
that
of
shrouded
desolation
the
sough
of
these
same
boughs
as
they
rapped
a
devil
s
tattoo
against
each
other
and
the
absence
of
even
the
rising
column
of
smoke
which
bespeaks
domestic
life
wherever
seen
all
gave
to
one
who
remembered
the
cognomen
cottage
and
forgot
the
of
gloom
a
sense
of
buried
life
as
sepulchral
as
that
which
emanates
from
the
mouth
of
some
freshly
opened
tomb
but
these
impressions
natural
enough
to
my
youth
were
necessarily
transient
and
soon
gave
way
to
others
more
perceiving
the
curve
of
an
arch
rising
above
the
undergrowth
still
blocking
my
approach
i
pushed
my
way
resolutely
through
and
presently
found
myself
stumbling
upon
the
steps
of
an
unexpectedly
spacious
domicile
built
not
of
wood
as
its
name
of
cottage
had
led
me
to
expect
but
of
carefully
cut
stone
which
while
showing
every
mark
of
time
proclaimed
itself
one
of
those
early
carefully
erected
colonial
residences
which
it
takes
more
than
a
century
to
destroy
or
even
to
wear
to
the
point
of
dilapidation
somewhat
encouraged
though
failing
to
detect
any
signs
of
active
life
in
the
heavily
shuttered
windows
frowning
upon
me
from
either
side
i
ran
up
the
steps
and
rang
the
bell
which
pulled
as
hard
as
if
no
hand
had
touched
it
in
years
then
i
waited
but
not
to
ring
again
for
just
as
my
hand
was
approaching
the
bell
a
second
time
the
door
fell
back
and
i
beheld
in
the
black
gap
before
me
the
oldest
man
i
had
ever
come
upon
in
my
whole
life
he
was
so
old
i
was
astonished
when
his
drawn
lips
opened
and
he
asked
if
i
was
the
lawyer
from
new
york
i
would
as
soon
have
expected
a
mummy
to
wag
its
tongue
and
utter
english
he
looked
so
thin
and
dried
and
removed
from
this
life
and
all
worldly
concerns
but
when
i
had
answered
his
question
and
he
had
turned
to
marshal
me
down
the
hall
towards
a
door
i
could
dimly
see
standing
open
in
the
twilight
of
an
absolutely
sunless
interior
i
noticed
that
his
step
was
not
without
some
vigour
despite
the
feeble
bend
of
his
withered
body
and
the
incessant
swaying
of
his
head
which
seemed
to
be
continually
saying
no
i
will
prepare
madam
he
admonished
me
after
drawing
a
ponderous
curtain
two
inches
or
less
aside
from
one
of
the
windows
she
is
very
ill
but
she
will
see
the
tone
was
senile
but
it
was
the
senility
of
an
educated
man
and
as
the
cultivated
accents
wavered
forth
my
mind
changed
in
regard
to
the
position
he
held
in
the
house
interested
anew
i
sought
to
give
him
another
look
but
he
had
already
vanished
through
the
doorway
and
so
noiselessly
it
was
more
like
a
shadow
s
flitting
than
a
man
s
withdrawal
the
darkness
in
which
i
sat
was
absolute
but
gradually
as
i
continued
to
look
about
me
the
spaces
lightened
and
certain
details
came
out
which
to
my
astonishment
were
of
a
character
to
show
that
the
plain
if
substantial
exterior
of
this
house
with
its
approaches
and
weedy
gardens
was
no
sample
of
what
was
to
be
found
inside
though
the
walls
surrounding
me
were
dismal
because
unlighted
they
betrayed
a
splendour
unusual
in
any
country
house
the
frescoes
and
paintings
were
of
an
ancient
order
dating
from
days
when
life
and
not
death
reigned
in
this
isolated
dwelling
but
in
them
high
art
reigned
supreme
an
art
so
high
and
so
finished
that
only
great
wealth
combined
with
the
most
cultivated
taste
could
have
produced
such
effects
i
was
still
absorbed
in
the
wonder
of
it
all
when
the
quiet
voice
of
the
old
gentleman
who
had
let
me
in
reached
me
again
from
the
doorway
and
i
heard
madam
is
ready
for
you
may
i
trouble
you
to
accompany
me
to
her
i
rose
with
alacrity
i
was
anxious
to
see
madam
if
only
to
satisfy
myself
that
she
was
as
interesting
as
the
house
in
which
she
was
i
found
her
a
great
deal
more
so
but
before
i
enter
upon
our
interview
let
me
mention
a
fact
which
had
attracted
my
attention
in
my
passage
to
her
room
during
his
absence
my
guide
evidently
had
pulled
aside
other
curtains
than
those
of
the
room
in
which
he
had
left
me
the
hall
no
longer
a
tunnel
of
darkness
gave
me
a
glimpse
as
we
went
by
of
various
secluded
corners
and
it
seemed
as
if
everywhere
i
looked
i
saw
a
clock
i
counted
four
before
i
reached
the
staircase
all
standing
on
the
floor
and
all
of
ancient
make
though
differing
much
in
appearance
and
value
a
fifth
one
rose
grim
and
tall
at
the
stair
foot
and
under
an
impulse
i
have
never
understood
i
stopped
when
i
reached
it
to
note
the
time
but
it
had
paused
in
its
task
and
faced
me
with
motionless
hands
and
silent
works
a
fact
which
somehow
startled
me
perhaps
because
just
then
i
encountered
the
old
man
s
eye
watching
me
with
an
expression
as
challenging
as
it
was
unintelligible
i
had
expected
to
see
a
woman
in
bed
i
saw
instead
a
woman
sitting
up
you
felt
her
influence
the
moment
you
entered
her
presence
she
was
not
young
she
was
not
beautiful
never
had
been
i
should
judge
she
had
not
even
the
usual
marks
about
her
of
an
ultra
strong
personality
but
that
her
will
was
law
had
always
been
and
would
continue
to
be
law
so
long
as
she
lived
was
patent
to
any
eye
at
the
first
glance
she
exacted
obedience
consciously
and
unconsciously
and
she
exacted
it
with
charm
some
few
people
in
the
world
possess
this
power
they
frown
and
the
opposing
will
weakens
they
smile
and
all
hearts
succumb
i
was
hers
from
the
moment
i
crossed
the
threshold
till
but
i
will
relate
the
happenings
of
that
instant
when
it
comes
she
was
alone
or
so
i
thought
when
i
made
my
first
bow
to
her
stern
but
not
unpleasing
presence
seated
in
a
great
chair
with
a
silver
tray
before
her
containing
such
little
matters
as
she
stood
in
hourly
need
of
she
confronted
me
with
a
piercing
gaze
startling
to
behold
in
eyes
so
colourless
then
she
smiled
and
in
obedience
to
that
smile
i
seated
myself
in
a
chair
placed
very
near
her
own
was
she
too
paralysed
to
express
herself
clearly
i
waited
in
some
anxiety
till
she
spoke
when
this
fear
vanished
her
voice
betrayed
the
character
her
features
failed
to
express
it
was
firm
resonant
and
instinct
with
command
not
loud
but
penetrating
and
of
a
quality
which
made
one
listen
with
his
heart
as
well
as
with
his
ears
what
she
said
is
immaterial
i
was
there
for
a
certain
purpose
and
we
entered
immediately
upon
the
business
of
that
purpose
she
talked
and
i
listened
mostly
without
comment
only
once
did
i
interrupt
her
with
a
suggestion
and
as
this
led
to
definite
results
i
will
proceed
to
relate
the
occurrence
in
full
in
the
few
hours
remaining
to
me
before
leaving
new
york
i
had
learned
no
matter
how
some
additional
particulars
concerning
herself
and
family
and
when
after
some
minor
bequests
she
proceeded
to
name
the
parties
to
whom
she
desired
to
leave
the
bulk
of
her
fortune
i
ventured
with
some
astonishment
at
my
own
temerity
to
remark
but
you
have
a
young
relative
is
she
not
to
be
included
in
this
partition
of
your
property
a
hush
then
a
smile
came
to
life
on
her
stiff
lips
such
as
is
seldom
seen
thank
god
on
the
face
of
any
woman
and
i
heard
the
young
relative
of
whom
you
speak
is
in
the
room
she
has
known
for
some
time
that
i
have
no
intention
of
leaving
anything
to
her
there
is
in
fact
small
chance
of
her
ever
needing
the
latter
sentence
was
a
muttered
one
but
that
it
was
loud
enough
to
be
heard
in
all
parts
of
the
room
i
was
soon
assured
for
a
quick
sigh
which
was
almost
a
gasp
followed
from
a
corner
i
had
hitherto
ignored
and
upon
glancing
that
way
i
perceived
peering
upon
us
from
the
shadows
the
white
face
of
a
young
girl
in
whose
drawn
features
and
wide
staring
eyes
i
beheld
such
evidences
of
terror
that
in
an
instant
whatever
predilection
i
had
hitherto
felt
for
my
client
vanished
in
distrust
if
not
positive
aversion
i
was
still
under
the
sway
of
this
new
impression
when
postlethwaite
s
voice
rose
again
this
time
addressing
the
young
girl
you
may
go
she
said
with
such
force
in
the
command
for
all
its
honeyed
modulation
that
i
expected
to
see
its
object
fly
the
room
in
frightened
obedience
but
though
the
startled
girl
had
lost
none
of
the
terror
which
had
made
her
face
like
a
mask
no
power
of
movement
remained
to
her
a
picture
of
hopeless
misery
she
stood
for
one
breathless
moment
with
her
eyes
fixed
in
unmistakable
appeal
on
mine
then
she
began
to
sway
so
helplessly
that
i
leaped
with
bounding
heart
to
catch
her
as
she
fell
into
my
arms
i
heard
her
sigh
as
before
no
common
anguish
spoke
in
that
sigh
i
had
stumbled
unwittingly
upon
a
tragedy
to
the
meaning
of
which
i
held
but
a
doubtful
key
she
seems
very
ill
i
observed
with
some
emphasis
as
i
turned
to
lay
my
helpless
burden
on
a
sofa
she
s
the
words
were
spoken
with
gloom
and
with
an
attempt
at
commiseration
which
no
longer
rang
true
in
my
ears
she
is
as
sick
a
woman
as
i
am
myself
continued
postlethwaite
that
is
why
i
made
the
remark
i
did
never
imagining
she
would
hear
me
at
that
distance
do
not
put
her
down
my
nurse
will
be
here
in
a
moment
to
relieve
you
of
your
a
tinkle
accompanied
these
words
the
resolute
woman
had
stretched
out
a
finger
of
whose
use
she
was
not
quite
deprived
and
touched
a
little
bell
standing
on
the
tray
before
her
an
inch
or
two
from
her
hand
pleased
to
obey
her
command
i
paused
at
the
sofa
s
edge
and
taking
advantage
of
the
momentary
delay
studied
the
youthful
countenance
pressed
unconsciously
to
my
breast
it
was
one
whose
appeal
lay
less
in
its
beauty
though
that
was
of
a
touching
quality
than
in
the
story
it
told
a
story
which
for
some
unaccountable
reason
i
did
not
pause
to
determine
what
one
i
felt
it
to
be
my
immediate
duty
to
know
but
i
asked
no
questions
then
i
did
not
even
venture
a
comment
and
yielded
her
up
with
seeming
readiness
when
a
strong
but
none
too
intelligent
woman
came
running
in
with
arms
outstretched
to
carry
her
off
when
the
door
had
closed
upon
these
two
the
silence
of
my
client
drew
my
attention
back
to
herself
i
am
waiting
was
her
quiet
observation
and
without
any
further
reference
to
what
had
just
taken
place
under
our
eyes
she
went
on
with
the
business
previously
occupying
us
i
was
able
to
do
my
part
without
any
too
great
display
of
my
own
disturbance
the
clearness
of
my
remarkable
client
s
instructions
the
definiteness
with
which
her
mind
was
made
up
as
to
the
disposal
of
every
dollar
of
her
vast
property
made
it
easy
for
me
to
master
each
detail
and
make
careful
note
of
every
wish
but
this
did
not
prevent
the
ebb
and
flow
within
me
of
an
undercurrent
of
thought
full
of
question
and
uneasiness
what
had
been
the
real
purport
of
the
scene
to
which
i
had
just
been
made
a
surprised
witness
the
few
but
certainly
unusual
facts
which
had
been
given
me
in
regard
to
the
extraordinary
relations
existing
between
these
two
closely
connected
women
will
explain
the
intensity
of
my
interest
those
facts
shall
be
yours
arabella
merwin
when
young
was
gifted
with
a
peculiar
fascination
which
as
we
have
seen
had
not
altogether
vanished
with
age
consequently
she
had
many
lovers
among
them
two
brothers
frank
and
andrew
postlethwaite
the
latter
was
the
older
the
handsomer
and
the
most
prosperous
his
name
is
remembered
yet
in
connection
with
south
american
schemes
of
large
importance
but
it
was
frank
she
married
that
real
love
ardent
if
unreasonable
lay
at
the
bottom
of
her
choice
is
evident
enough
to
those
who
followed
the
career
of
the
young
couple
but
it
was
a
jealous
love
which
brooked
no
rival
and
as
frank
postlethwaite
was
of
an
impulsive
and
erratic
nature
scenes
soon
occurred
between
them
which
while
revealing
the
extraordinary
force
of
the
young
wife
s
character
led
to
no
serious
break
till
after
her
son
was
born
and
this
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
frank
had
long
given
up
making
a
living
and
that
they
were
openly
dependent
on
their
wealthy
brother
now
fast
approaching
the
millionaire
status
this
brother
the
peruvian
king
as
some
called
him
must
have
been
an
extraordinary
man
though
cherishing
his
affection
for
the
spirited
arabella
to
the
point
of
remaining
a
bachelor
for
her
sake
he
betrayed
none
of
the
usual
signs
of
disappointed
love
but
on
the
contrary
made
every
effort
to
advance
her
happiness
not
only
by
assuring
to
herself
and
husband
an
adequate
income
but
by
doing
all
he
could
in
other
and
less
open
ways
to
lessen
any
sense
she
might
entertain
of
her
mistake
in
preferring
for
her
lifemate
his
and
unstable
brother
she
should
have
adored
him
but
though
she
evinced
gratitude
enough
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
she
ever
gave
frank
postlethwaite
the
least
cause
to
cherish
any
other
sentiment
towards
his
brother
than
that
of
honest
love
and
unqualified
respect
perhaps
he
never
did
cherish
any
other
perhaps
the
change
which
everyone
saw
in
the
young
couple
immediately
after
the
birth
of
their
only
child
was
due
to
another
cause
gossip
is
silent
on
this
point
all
that
it
insists
upon
is
that
from
this
time
evidences
of
a
growing
estrangement
between
them
became
so
obvious
that
even
the
indulgent
andrew
could
not
blind
himself
to
it
showing
his
sense
of
trouble
not
by
lessening
their
income
for
that
he
doubled
but
by
spending
more
time
in
peru
and
less
in
new
york
where
the
two
were
living
however
and
here
we
enter
upon
those
details
which
i
have
ventured
to
characterize
as
uncommon
he
was
in
this
country
and
in
the
actual
company
of
his
brother
when
the
accident
occurred
which
terminated
both
their
lives
it
was
the
old
story
of
a
skidding
motor
and
postlethwaite
having
been
sent
for
in
great
haste
to
the
small
inn
into
which
the
two
injured
men
had
been
carried
arrived
only
in
time
to
witness
their
last
moments
frank
died
first
and
andrew
some
few
minutes
later
an
important
fact
as
was
afterwards
shown
when
the
latter
s
will
came
to
be
read
this
will
was
a
peculiar
one
by
its
provisions
the
bulk
of
the
king
s
great
property
was
left
to
his
brother
frank
but
with
this
especial
stipulation
that
in
case
his
brother
failed
to
survive
him
the
full
legacy
as
bequeathed
to
him
should
be
given
unconditionally
to
his
widow
frank
s
demise
as
i
have
already
stated
preceded
his
brother
s
by
several
minutes
and
consequently
arabella
became
the
chief
legatee
and
that
is
how
she
obtained
her
millions
but
and
here
a
startling
feature
comes
in
when
the
will
came
to
be
administered
the
secret
underlying
the
break
between
frank
and
his
wife
was
brought
to
light
by
a
revelation
of
the
fact
that
he
had
practised
a
great
deception
upon
her
at
the
time
of
his
marriage
instead
of
being
a
bachelor
as
was
currently
believed
he
was
in
reality
a
widower
and
the
father
of
a
child
this
fact
so
long
held
secret
had
become
hers
when
her
own
child
was
born
and
constituted
as
she
was
she
not
only
never
forgave
the
father
but
conceived
such
a
hatred
for
the
innocent
object
of
their
quarrel
that
she
refused
to
admit
its
claims
or
even
to
acknowledge
its
existence
but
later
after
his
death
in
fact
she
showed
some
sense
of
obligation
towards
one
who
under
ordinary
conditions
would
have
shared
her
wealth
when
the
whole
story
became
heard
and
she
discovered
that
this
secret
had
been
kept
from
his
brother
as
well
as
from
herself
and
that
consequently
no
provision
had
been
made
in
any
way
for
the
child
thus
thrown
directly
upon
her
mercy
she
did
the
generous
thing
and
took
the
forsaken
girl
into
her
own
home
but
she
never
betrayed
the
least
love
for
her
her
whole
heart
being
bound
up
in
her
boy
who
was
as
all
agree
a
prodigy
of
talent
but
this
boy
for
all
his
promise
and
seeming
strength
of
constitution
died
when
barely
seven
years
old
and
the
desolate
mother
was
left
with
nothing
to
fill
her
heart
but
the
uncongenial
daughter
of
her
husband
s
first
wife
the
fact
that
this
child
slighted
as
it
had
hitherto
been
would
in
the
event
of
her
uncle
having
passed
away
before
her
father
have
been
the
undisputed
heiress
of
a
large
portion
of
the
wealth
now
at
the
disposal
of
her
arrogant
led
many
to
expect
now
that
the
boy
was
no
more
that
postlethwaite
would
proceed
to
acknowledge
the
little
helena
as
her
heir
and
give
her
that
place
in
the
household
to
which
her
natural
claims
entitled
her
but
no
such
result
followed
the
passion
of
grief
into
which
the
mother
was
thrown
by
the
shipwreck
of
all
her
hopes
left
her
hard
and
implacable
and
when
as
very
soon
happened
she
fell
a
victim
to
the
disease
which
tied
her
to
her
chair
and
made
the
wealth
which
had
come
to
her
by
such
a
peculiar
ordering
of
circumstances
little
else
than
a
mockery
even
in
her
own
eyes
it
was
upon
this
child
she
expended
the
full
fund
of
her
secret
bitterness
and
the
child
what
of
her
how
did
she
bear
her
unhappy
fate
when
she
grew
old
enough
to
realize
it
with
a
resignation
which
was
the
wonder
of
all
who
knew
her
no
murmurs
escaped
her
lips
nor
was
the
devotion
she
invariably
displayed
to
the
exacting
invalid
who
ruled
her
as
well
as
all
the
rest
of
her
household
with
a
rod
of
iron
ever
disturbed
by
the
least
sign
of
reproach
though
the
riches
which
in
those
early
days
poured
into
the
home
in
a
measure
far
beyond
the
needs
of
its
mistress
were
expended
in
making
the
house
beautiful
rather
than
in
making
the
one
young
life
within
it
happy
she
never
was
heard
to
utter
so
much
as
a
wish
to
leave
the
walls
within
which
fate
had
immured
her
content
or
seemingly
content
with
the
only
home
she
knew
she
never
asked
for
change
or
demanded
friends
or
amusements
visitors
ceased

desolation
followed
neglect
the
garden
once
a
glory
succumbed
to
a
riot
of
weeds
and
undesirable
brush
till
a
towering
wall
seemed
to
be
drawn
about
the
house
cutting
it
off
from
the
activities
of
the
world
as
it
cut
it
off
from
the
approach
of
sunshine
by
day
and
the
comfort
of
a
heaven
by
night
and
yet
the
young
girl
continued
to
smile
though
with
a
pitifulness
of
late
which
some
thought
betokened
secret
terror
and
others
the
wasting
of
a
body
too
sensitive
for
such
unwholesome
seclusion
these
were
the
facts
known
if
not
consciously
specialized
which
gave
to
the
latter
part
of
my
interview
with
postlethwaite
a
poignancy
of
interest
which
had
never
attended
any
of
my
former
experiences
the
peculiar
attitude
of
miss
postlethwaite
towards
her
indurate
tormentor
awakened
in
my
agitated
mind
something
much
deeper
than
curiosity
but
when
i
strove
to
speak
her
name
with
the
intent
of
inquiring
more
particularly
into
her
condition
such
a
look
confronted
me
from
the
steady
eye
immovably
fixed
upon
my
own
that
my
courage
or
was
it
my
natural
precaution
bade
me
subdue
the
impulse
and
risk
no
attempt
which
might
betray
the
depth
of
my
interest
in
one
so
completely
outside
the
scope
of
the
present
moment
s
business
perhaps
postlethwaite
appreciated
my
struggle
perhaps
she
was
wholly
blind
to
it
there
was
no
reading
the
mind
of
this
woman
of
sentimental
name
but
inflexible
nature
and
realizing
the
fact
more
fully
with
every
word
she
uttered
i
left
her
at
last
with
no
further
betrayal
of
my
feelings
than
might
be
evinced
by
the
earnestness
with
which
i
promised
to
return
for
her
signature
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
this
she
had
herself
requested
saying
as
i
rose
i
can
still
write
my
name
if
the
paper
is
pushed
carefully
along
under
my
hand
see
to
it
that
you
come
while
the
power
remains
to
i
had
hoped
that
in
my
passage
downstairs
i
might
run
upon
someone
who
would
give
me
news
of
miss
postlethwaite
but
the
woman
who
approached
to
conduct
me
downstairs
was
not
of
an
appearance
to
invite
confidence
and
i
felt
forced
to
leave
the
house
with
my
doubts
unsatisfied
two
memories
equally
distinct
followed
me
one
was
a
picture
of
postlethwaite
s
fingers
groping
among
her
belongings
on
the
little
tray
perched
upon
her
lap
and
another
of
the
intent
and
strangely
bent
figure
of
the
old
man
who
had
acted
as
my
usher
listening
to
the
ticking
of
one
of
the
great
clocks
so
absorbed
was
he
in
this
occupation
that
he
not
only
failed
to
notice
me
when
i
went
by
but
he
did
not
even
lift
his
head
at
my
cheery
greeting
such
mysteries
were
too
much
for
me
and
led
me
to
postpone
my
departure
from
town
till
i
had
sought
out
postlethwaite
s
doctor
and
propounded
to
him
one
or
two
leading
questions
first
would
postlethwaite
s
present
condition
be
likely
to
hold
good
till
monday
and
secondly
was
the
young
lady
living
with
her
as
ill
as
her
said
he
was
a
mild
old
man
of
the
type
and
the
answers
i
got
from
him
were
far
from
satisfactory
yet
he
showed
some
surprise
when
i
mentioned
the
extent
of
postlethwaite
s
anxiety
about
her
and
paused
in
the
dubious
shaking
of
his
head
to
give
me
a
short
stare
in
which
i
read
as
much
determination
as
perplexity
i
will
look
into
miss
postlethwaite
s
case
more
particularly
were
his
parting
words
and
with
this
one
gleam
of
comfort
i
had
to
be
content
monday
s
interview
was
a
brief
one
and
contained
nothing
worth
repeating
postlethwaite
listened
with
stoical
satisfaction
to
the
reading
of
the
will
i
had
drawn
up
and
upon
its
completion
rang
her
bell
for
the
two
witnesses
awaiting
her
summons
in
an
adjoining
room
they
were
not
of
her
household
but
to
all
appearance
honest
villagers
with
but
one
noticeable
characteristic
an
overweening
idea
of
postlethwaite
s
importance
perhaps
the
spell
she
had
so
liberally
woven
for
others
in
other
and
happier
days
was
felt
by
them
at
this
hour
it
would
not
be
strange
i
had
almost
fallen
under
it
myself
so
great
was
the
fascination
of
her
manner
even
in
this
wreck
of
her
bodily
powers
when
triumph
assured
she
faced
us
all
in
a
state
of
complete
satisfaction
but
before
i
was
again
quit
of
the
place
all
my
doubts
returned
and
in
fuller
force
than
ever
i
had
lingered
in
my
going
as
much
as
decency
would
permit
hoping
to
hear
a
step
on
the
stair
or
see
a
face
in
some
doorway
which
would
contradict
postlethwaite
s
cold
assurance
that
miss
postlethwaite
was
no
better
but
no
such
step
did
i
hear
and
no
face
did
i
see
save
the
old
old
one
of
the
ancient
friend
or
relative
whose
bent
frame
seemed
continually
to
haunt
the
halls
as
before
he
stood
listening
to
the
monotonous
ticking
of
one
of
the
clocks
muttering
to
himself
and
quite
oblivious
of
my
presence
however
this
time
i
decided
not
to
pass
him
without
a
more
persistent
attempt
to
gain
his
notice
pausing
at
his
side
i
asked
him
in
the
friendly
tone
i
thought
best
calculated
to
attract
his
attention
how
miss
postlethwaite
was
he
was
so
intent
upon
his
task
whatever
that
was
that
while
he
turned
my
way
it
was
with
a
glance
as
blank
as
that
of
a
stone
image
listen
he
admonished
me
it
still
says
no
no
i
don
t
think
it
will
ever
say
anything
i
stared
at
him
in
some
consternation
then
at
the
clock
itself
which
was
the
tall
one
i
had
found
run
down
at
my
first
visit
there
was
nothing
unusual
in
its
quiet
tick
so
far
as
i
could
hear
and
with
a
compassionate
glance
at
the
old
man
who
had
turned
breathlessly
again
to
listen
proceeded
on
my
way
without
another
word
the
old
fellow
was
daft
a
century
old
and
daft
i
had
worked
my
way
out
through
the
vines
which
still
encumbered
the
porch
and
was
taking
my
first
steps
down
the
walk
when
some
impulse
made
me
turn
and
glance
up
at
one
of
the
windows
did
i
bless
the
impulse
i
thought
i
had
every
reason
for
doing
so
when
through
a
network
of
interlacing
branches
i
beheld
the
young
girl
with
whom
my
mind
was
wholly
occupied
standing
with
her
head
thrust
forward
watching
the
descent
of
something
small
and
white
which
she
had
just
released
from
her
hand
a
note
a
note
written
by
her
and
meant
for
me
with
a
grateful
look
in
her
direction
which
was
probably
lost
upon
her
as
she
had
already
drawn
back
out
of
sight
i
sprang
for
it
only
to
meet
with
disappointment
for
it
was
no
i
received
from
amid
the
clustering
brush
where
it
had
fallen
but
a
small
square
of
white
cloth
showing
a
line
of
fantastic
embroidery
annoyed
beyond
measure
i
was
about
to
fling
it
down
again
when
the
thought
that
it
had
come
from
her
hand
deterred
me
and
i
thrust
it
into
my
vest
pocket
when
i
took
it
out
again
which
was
soon
after
i
had
taken
my
seat
in
the
car
i
discovered
what
a
mistake
i
should
have
made
if
i
had
followed
my
first
impulse
for
upon
examining
the
stitches
more
carefully
i
perceived
that
what
i
had
considered
a
mere
decorative
pattern
was
in
fact
a
string
of
letters
and
that
these
letters
made
words
and
that
these
words
were
idonotwanttodiebutisurelywillif
or
in
plain
writing
i
do
not
want
to
die
but
i
surely
will
if
finish
the
sentence
for
me
that
is
the
problem
i
offer
you
it
is
not
a
case
for
the
police
but
one
well
worth
your
attention
if
you
succeed
in
reaching
the
heart
of
this
mystery
and
saving
this
young
girl
only
let
no
delay
occur
the
doom
if
doom
it
is
is
immanent
remember
that
the
will
is
signed
she
is
too
small
i
did
not
ask
you
to
send
me
a
thus
spoke
postlethwaite
to
her
doctor
as
he
introduced
into
her
presence
a
little
figure
in
nurse
s
cap
and
apron
you
said
i
needed
care
more
care
than
i
was
receiving
i
answered
that
my
old
nurse
could
give
it
and
you
objected
that
she
or
someone
else
must
look
after
miss
postlethwaite
i
did
not
see
the
necessity
but
i
never
contradict
a
doctor
so
i
yielded
to
your
wishes
but
not
without
the
proviso
you
remember
that
i
made
a
proviso
that
whatever
sort
of
young
woman
you
chose
to
introduce
into
this
room
she
should
not
be
fresh
from
the
training
schools
and
that
she
should
be
strong
silent
and
capable
and
you
bring
me
this
mite
of
a
woman
is
she
a
woman
she
looks
more
like
a
child
of
pleasing
countenance
enough
but
who
can
no
more
lift
me
pardon
me
little
miss
strange
had
advanced
i
think
if
you
will
allow
me
the
privilege
madam
that
i
can
shift
you
into
a
much
more
comfortable
and
with
a
deftness
and
ease
certainly
not
to
be
expected
from
one
of
her
slight
physique
violet
raised
the
helpless
invalid
a
trifle
more
upon
her
pillow
the
act
its
manner
and
the
smile
accompanying
it
could
not
fail
to
please
and
undoubtedly
did
though
no
word
rewarded
her
from
lips
not
much
given
to
speech
save
when
the
occasion
was
imperative
but
postlethwaite
made
no
further
objection
to
her
presence
and
seeing
this
the
doctor
s
countenance
relaxed
and
he
left
the
room
with
a
much
lighter
step
than
that
with
which
he
had
entered
it
and
thus
it
was
that
violet
strange
an
adept
in
more
ways
than
one
became
installed
at
the
bedside
of
this
mysterious
woman
whose
days
if
numbered
still
held
possibilities
of
action
which
those
interested
in
young
helena
postlethwaite
s
fate
would
do
well
to
recognize
miss
strange
had
been
at
her
post
for
two
days
and
had
gathered
up
the
following
that
postlethwaite
must
be
obeyed
that
her
who
did
not
wish
to
die
would
die
if
she
knew
it
to
be
the
wish
of
this
domineering
but
apparently
idolized
woman
that
the
old
man
of
the
clocks
while
senile
in
some
regards
was
very
alert
and
quite
youthful
in
others
if
a
century
old
which
she
began
greatly
to
doubt
he
had
the
language
and
manner
of
one
in
his
prime
when
unaffected
by
the
neighbourhood
of
the
clocks
which
seemed
in
some
way
to
exercise
an
occult
influence
over
him
at
table
he
was
an
entertaining
host
but
neither
there
nor
elsewhere
would
he
discuss
the
family
or
dilate
in
any
way
upon
the
peculiarities
of
a
household
of
which
he
manifestly
regarded
himself
as
the
least
important
member
yet
no
one
knew
them
better
and
when
violet
became
quite
assured
of
this
as
well
as
of
the
futility
of
looking
for
explanation
of
any
kind
from
either
of
her
two
patients
she
resolved
upon
an
effort
to
surprise
one
from
him
she
went
about
it
in
this
way
noting
his
custom
of
making
a
complete
round
of
the
clocks
each
night
after
dinner
she
took
advantage
of
postlethwaite
s
inclination
to
sleep
at
this
hour
to
follow
him
from
clock
to
clock
in
the
hope
of
overhearing
some
portion
of
the
monologue
with
which
he
bent
his
head
to
the
swinging
pendulum
or
put
his
ear
to
the
hidden
works
and
discreet
she
tripped
along
at
his
back
and
at
each
pause
he
made
paused
herself
and
turned
her
ear
his
way
the
extreme
darkness
of
the
halls
which
were
more
sombre
by
night
than
by
day
favoured
this
attempt
and
she
was
able
after
a
failure
or
two
to
catch
the
no
no
no
no
which
fell
from
his
lips
in
seeming
repetition
of
what
he
heard
the
most
of
them
say
the
satisfaction
in
his
tone
proved
that
the
denial
to
which
he
listened
chimed
in
with
his
hopes
and
gave
ease
to
his
mind
but
he
looked
his
oldest
when
after
pausing
at
another
of
the
many
he
echoed
in
answer
to
its
special
refrain
yes
yes
yes
yes
and
fled
the
spot
with
shaking
body
and
a
distracted
air
the
same
fear
and
the
same
shrinking
were
observable
in
him
as
he
returned
from
listening
to
the
least
conspicuous
one
standing
in
a
short
corridor
where
violet
could
not
follow
him
but
when
after
a
hesitation
which
enabled
her
to
slip
behind
the
curtain
hiding
the
door
he
approached
and
laid
his
ear
against
the
great
one
standing
as
if
on
guard
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
she
saw
by
the
renewed
vigour
he
displayed
that
there
was
comfort
for
him
in
its
message
even
before
she
caught
the
whisper
with
which
he
left
it
and
proceeded
to
mount
the
stairs
it
says
no
it
always
says
no
i
will
heed
it
as
the
voice
of
but
one
conclusion
could
be
the
result
of
such
an
experiment
to
a
mind
like
violet
s
this
partly
touched
old
man
not
only
held
the
key
to
the
secret
of
this
house
but
was
in
a
mood
to
divulge
it
if
once
he
could
be
induced
to
hear
command
instead
of
dissuasion
in
the
tick
of
this
one
large
clock
but
how
could
he
be
induced
violet
returned
to
postlethwaite
s
bedside
in
a
mood
of
extreme
thoughtfulness
another
day
passed
and
she
had
not
yet
seen
miss
postlethwaite
she
was
hoping
each
hour
to
be
sent
on
some
errand
to
that
young
lady
s
room
but
no
such
opportunity
was
granted
her
once
she
ventured
to
ask
the
doctor
whose
visits
were
now
very
frequent
what
he
thought
of
the
young
lady
s
condition
but
as
this
question
was
necessarily
put
in
postlethwaite
s
presence
the
answer
was
naturally
guarded
and
possibly
not
altogether
frank
our
young
lady
is
weaker
he
acknowledged
much
weaker
he
added
with
marked
emphasis
and
his
most
professional
air
or
she
would
be
here
instead
of
in
her
own
room
it
grieves
her
not
to
be
able
to
wait
upon
her
generous
the
word
fell
heavily
had
it
been
used
as
a
test
violet
gave
him
a
look
though
she
had
much
rather
have
turned
her
discriminating
eye
upon
the
face
staring
up
at
them
from
the
pillow
had
the
alarm
expressed
by
others
communicated
itself
at
last
to
the
physician
was
the
charm
which
had
held
him
subservient
to
the
mother
dissolving
under
the
pitiable
state
of
the
child
and
was
he
trying
to
aid
the
little
in
her
effort
to
sound
the
mystery
of
her
condition
his
look
expressed
benevolence
but
he
took
care
not
to
meet
the
gaze
of
the
woman
he
had
just
lauded
possibly
because
that
gaze
was
fixed
upon
him
in
a
way
to
tax
his
moral
courage
the
silence
which
ensued
was
broken
by
postlethwaite
she
will
live
this
poor
helena
how
long
she
asked
with
no
break
in
her
voice
s
wonted
music
the
doctor
hesitated
then
with
a
candour
hardly
to
be
expected
from
him
answered
i
do
not
understand
miss
postlethwaite
s
case
i
should
like
with
your
permission
to
consult
some
new
york
indeed
a
single
word
but
as
it
left
this
woman
s
thin
lips
violet
recoiled
and
perhaps
the
doctor
did
rage
can
speak
in
one
word
as
well
as
in
a
dozen
and
the
rage
which
spoke
in
this
one
was
of
no
common
order
though
it
was
quickly
suppressed
as
was
all
other
show
of
feeling
when
she
added
with
a
touch
of
her
old
charm
of
course
you
will
do
what
you
think
best
as
you
know
i
never
interfere
with
a
doctor
s
decisions
but
and
here
her
natural
ascendancy
of
tone
and
manner
returned
in
all
its
potency
it
would
kill
me
to
know
that
a
stranger
was
approaching
helena
s
bedside
it
would
kill
her
she
s
too
sensitive
to
survive
such
a
violet
recalled
the
words
worked
with
so
much
care
by
this
young
girl
on
a
minute
piece
of
linen
i
do
not
want
to
die
and
watched
the
doctor
s
face
for
some
sign
of
resolution
but
embarrassment
was
all
she
saw
there
and
all
she
heard
him
say
was
the
conventional
reply
i
am
doing
all
i
can
for
her
we
will
wait
another
day
and
note
the
effect
of
my
latest
another
day
the
deathly
calm
which
overspread
postlethwaite
s
features
as
this
word
left
the
physician
s
lips
warned
violet
not
to
let
another
day
go
by
without
some
action
but
she
made
no
remark
and
indeed
betrayed
but
little
interest
in
anything
beyond
her
own
patient
s
condition
that
seemed
to
occupy
her
wholly
with
consummate
art
she
gave
the
appearance
of
being
under
postlethwaite
s
complete
thrall
and
watched
with
fascinated
eyes
every
movement
of
the
one
unstricken
finger
which
could
do
so
much
this
little
detective
of
ours
could
be
an
excellent
actor
when
she
chose
iii
to
make
the
old
man
speak
to
force
this
but
rebellious
soul
to
reveal
what
the
clock
forbade
how
could
it
be
done
this
continued
to
be
violet
s
great
problem
she
pondered
it
so
deeply
during
all
the
remainder
of
the
day
that
a
little
pucker
settled
on
her
brow
which
someone
i
will
not
mention
who
would
have
been
pained
to
see
postlethwaite
if
she
noticed
it
at
all
probably
ascribed
it
to
her
anxieties
as
nurse
for
never
had
violet
been
more
assiduous
in
her
attentions
but
postlethwaite
was
no
longer
the
woman
she
had
been
and
possibly
never
noted
it
at
all
at
five
o
clock
violet
suddenly
left
the
room
slipping
down
into
the
lower
hall
she
went
the
round
of
the
clocks
herself
listening
to
every
one
there
was
no
perceptible
difference
in
their
tick
satisfied
of
this
and
that
it
was
simply
the
old
man
s
imagination
which
had
supplied
them
each
with
separate
speech
she
paused
before
the
huge
one
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
the
one
whose
dictate
he
had
promised
himself
to
follow
and
with
an
eye
upon
its
broad
staring
dial
muttered
wistfully
oh
for
an
idea
for
an
idea
did
this
cumbrous
relic
of
precision
turn
traitor
at
this
ingenuous
plea
the
dial
continued
to
stare
the
works
to
sing
but
violet
s
face
suddenly
lost
its
perplexity
with
a
wary
look
about
her
and
a
listening
ear
turned
towards
the
stair
top
she
stretched
out
her
hand
and
pulled
open
the
door
guarding
the
pendulum
and
peered
in
at
the
works
smiling
slyly
to
herself
as
she
pushed
it
back
into
place
and
retreated
upstairs
to
the
sick
room
when
the
doctor
came
that
night
she
had
a
quiet
word
with
him
outside
postlethwaite
s
door
was
that
why
he
was
on
hand
when
old
dunbar
stole
from
his
room
to
make
his
nightly
circuit
of
the
halls
below
something
quite
beyond
the
ordinary
was
in
the
good
physician
s
mind
for
the
look
he
cast
at
the
old
man
was
quite
unlike
any
he
had
ever
bestowed
upon
him
before
and
when
he
spoke
it
was
to
say
with
marked
urgency
our
beautiful
young
lady
will
not
live
a
week
unless
i
get
at
the
seat
of
her
malady
pray
that
i
may
be
enabled
to
do
so
a
blow
to
the
aged
man
s
heart
which
called
forth
a
feeble
yes
yes
followed
by
a
wild
stare
which
imprinted
itself
upon
the
doctor
s
memory
as
the
look
of
one
hopelessly
old
who
hears
for
the
first
time
a
distinct
call
from
the
grave
which
has
long
been
awaiting
him
a
solitary
lamp
stood
in
the
lower
hall
as
the
old
man
picked
his
slow
way
down
its
small
hesitating
flame
flared
up
as
in
a
sudden
gust
then
sank
down
flickering
and
faint
as
if
it
too
had
heard
a
call
which
summoned
it
to
extinction
no
other
sign
of
life
was
visible
anywhere
sunk
in
twilight
shadows
the
corridors
branched
away
on
either
side
to
no
place
in
particular
and
serving
to
all
appearance
as
many
must
have
thought
in
days
gone
by
as
a
mere
for
clocks
to
listen
to
their
united
hum
the
old
man
paused
looking
at
first
a
little
distraught
but
settling
at
last
into
his
usual
self
as
he
started
forward
upon
his
course
did
some
whisper
hitherto
unheard
warn
him
that
it
was
the
last
time
he
would
tread
that
weary
round
who
can
tell
he
was
trembling
very
much
when
with
his
task
nearly
completed
he
stepped
out
again
into
the
main
hall
and
crept
rather
than
walked
back
to
the
one
great
clock
to
whose
dictum
he
made
it
a
practice
to
listen
last
chattering
the
accustomed
words
they
say
yes
they
are
all
saying
yes
now
but
this
one
will
say
no
he
bent
his
stiff
old
back
and
laid
his
ear
to
the
unresponsive
wood
but
the
time
for
no
had
passed
it
was
yes
yes
yes
yes
now
and
as
his
straining
ears
took
in
the
word
he
appeared
to
shrink
where
he
stood
and
after
a
moment
of
anguished
silence
broke
forth
into
a
low
wail
amid
whose
lamentations
one
could
hear
the
time
has
come
even
the
clock
she
loves
best
bids
me
speak
oh
arabella
arabella
in
his
despair
he
had
not
noticed
that
the
pendulum
hung
motionless
or
that
the
hands
stood
at
rest
on
the
dial
if
he
had
he
might
have
waited
long
enough
to
have
seen
the
careful
opening
of
the
great
clock
s
tall
door
and
the
stepping
forth
of
the
little
lady
who
had
played
so
deftly
upon
his
superstition
he
was
wandering
the
corridors
like
a
helpless
child
when
a
gentle
hand
fell
on
his
arm
and
a
soft
voice
whispered
in
his
ear
you
have
a
story
to
tell
will
you
tell
it
to
me
it
may
save
miss
postlethwaite
s
did
he
understand
would
he
respond
if
he
did
or
would
the
shock
of
her
appeal
restore
him
to
a
sense
of
the
danger
attending
disloyalty
for
a
moment
she
doubted
the
wisdom
of
this
startling
measure
then
she
saw
that
he
had
passed
the
point
of
surprise
and
that
stranger
as
she
was
she
had
but
to
lead
the
way
for
him
to
follow
tell
his
story
and
die
there
was
no
light
in
the
when
they
entered
but
old
dunbar
did
not
seem
to
mind
that
indeed
he
seemed
to
have
lost
all
consciousness
of
present
surroundings
he
was
even
oblivious
of
her
this
became
quite
evident
when
the
lamp
in
flaring
up
again
in
the
hall
gave
a
momentary
glimpse
of
his
crouching
figure
in
the
pleading
gesture
of
his
trembling
outreaching
arms
violet
beheld
an
appeal
not
to
herself
but
to
some
phantom
of
his
imagination
and
when
he
spoke
as
he
presently
did
it
was
with
the
freedom
of
one
to
whom
speech
is
life
s
last
boon
and
the
ear
of
the
listener
quite
forgotten
in
the
passion
of
confession
long
suppressed
she
has
never
loved
me
he
began
but
i
have
always
loved
her
for
me
no
other
woman
has
ever
existed
though
i
was
years
of
age
when
i
first
saw
her
and
had
long
given
up
the
idea
that
there
lived
a
woman
who
could
sway
me
from
my
even
life
and
fixed
lines
of
duty
and
she
a
youthful
bride
was
there
ever
such
folly
happily
i
realized
it
from
the
first
and
piled
ashes
on
my
hidden
flame
perhaps
that
is
why
i
adore
her
to
this
day
and
only
give
her
over
to
reprobation
because
fate
is
stronger
than
my
age
stronger
even
than
my
love
she
is
not
a
good
woman
but
i
might
have
been
a
good
man
if
i
had
never
known
the
sin
which
drew
a
line
of
isolation
about
her
and
within
which
i
and
only
i
have
stood
with
her
in
silent
companionship
what
was
this
sin
and
in
what
did
it
have
its
beginning
i
think
its
beginning
was
in
the
passion
she
had
for
her
husband
it
was
not
the
passion
of
her
sex
in
this
land
of
equable
affections
but
one
of
foreign
fierceness
jealousy
and
insatiable
demand
yet
he
was
a
very
ordinary
man
i
was
once
his
tutor
and
i
know
she
came
to
know
it
too
when
but
i
am
rushing
on
too
fast
i
have
much
to
tell
before
i
reach
that
point
from
the
first
i
was
in
their
confidence
not
that
either
he
or
she
put
me
there
but
that
i
lived
with
them
and
was
always
around
and
could
not
help
seeing
and
hearing
what
went
on
between
them
why
he
continued
to
want
me
in
the
house
and
at
his
table
when
i
could
no
longer
be
of
service
to
him
i
have
never
known
possibly
habit
explains
all
he
was
accustomed
to
my
presence
and
so
was
she
so
accustomed
they
hardly
noticed
it
as
happened
one
night
when
after
a
little
attempt
at
conversation
he
threw
down
the
book
he
had
caught
up
and
addressing
her
by
name
said
without
a
glance
my
way
and
quite
as
if
he
were
alone
with
her
arabella
there
is
something
i
ought
to
tell
you
i
have
tried
to
find
the
courage
to
do
so
many
times
before
now
but
have
always
failed
tonight
i
and
then
he
made
his
great
disclosure
how
unknown
to
his
friends
and
the
world
he
was
a
widower
when
he
married
her
and
the
father
of
a
living
child
with
some
women
this
might
have
passed
with
a
measure
of
regret
and
some
possible
contempt
for
his
silence
but
not
so
with
her
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
can
see
her
yet
and
for
a
moment
stood
facing
him
in
the
still
overpowering
manner
of
one
who
feels
the
icy
pang
of
hate
enter
where
love
has
been
never
was
moment
more
charged
i
could
not
breathe
while
it
lasted
and
when
at
last
she
spoke
it
was
with
an
impetuosity
of
concentrated
passion
hardly
less
dreadful
than
her
silence
had
been
you
a
father
a
father
already
she
cried
all
her
sweetness
swallowed
up
in
ungovernable
wrath
you
whom
i
expected
to
make
so
happy
with
a
child
i
curse
you
and
your
brat
i
he
strove
to
placate
her
to
explain
but
rage
has
no
ears
and
before
i
realized
my
own
position
the
scene
became
openly
tempestuous
that
her
child
should
be
second
to
another
woman
s
seemed
to
awaken
demon
instincts
within
her
when
he
ventured
to
hint
that
his
little
girl
needed
a
mother
s
care
her
irony
bit
like
corroding
acid
he
became
speechless
before
it
and
had
not
a
protest
to
raise
when
she
declared
that
the
secret
he
had
kept
so
long
and
so
successfully
he
must
continue
to
keep
to
his
dying
day
that
the
child
he
had
failed
to
own
in
his
first
wife
s
lifetime
should
remain
disowned
in
hers
and
if
possible
be
forgotten
she
should
never
give
the
girl
a
thought
nor
acknowledge
her
in
any
way
she
was
fury
embodied
but
the
fury
was
of
that
grand
order
which
allures
rather
than
repels
as
i
felt
myself
succumbing
to
its
fascination
and
beheld
how
he
was
weakening
under
it
even
more
perceptibly
than
myself
i
started
from
my
chair
and
sought
to
glide
away
before
i
should
hear
him
utter
a
fatal
acquiescence
but
the
movement
i
made
unfortunately
drew
their
attention
to
me
and
after
an
instant
of
silent
contemplation
of
my
distracted
countenance
frank
said
as
though
he
were
the
elder
by
the
forty
years
which
separated
us
you
have
listened
to
postlethwaite
s
wishes
you
will
respect
them
of
that
was
all
he
knew
and
she
knew
that
i
was
to
be
trusted
but
neither
of
them
has
ever
known
why
a
month
later
her
child
came
and
was
welcomed
as
though
it
were
the
first
to
bear
his
name
it
was
a
boy
and
their
satisfaction
was
so
great
that
i
looked
to
see
their
old
affection
revive
but
it
had
been
cleft
at
the
root
and
nothing
could
restore
it
to
life
they
loved
the
child
i
have
never
seen
evidence
of
greater
parental
passion
than
they
both
displayed
but
there
their
feelings
stopped
towards
each
other
they
were
cold
they
did
not
even
unite
in
worship
of
their
treasure
they
gloated
over
him
and
planned
for
him
but
always
apart
he
was
a
child
in
a
thousand
and
as
he
developed
the
mother
especially
nursed
all
her
energies
for
the
purpose
of
ensuring
for
him
a
future
commensurate
with
his
talents
never
a
very
conscientious
woman
and
alive
to
the
advantages
of
wealth
as
demonstrated
by
the
power
wielded
by
her
rich
she
associated
all
the
boy
s
prospects
with
money
great
money
such
money
as
andrew
had
accumulated
and
now
had
at
his
disposal
for
his
natural
heirs
hence
came
her
great
temptation
a
temptation
to
which
she
yielded
to
the
lasting
trouble
of
us
all
of
this
i
must
now
make
confession
though
it
kills
me
to
do
so
and
will
soon
kill
her
the
deeds
of
the
past
do
not
remain
buried
however
deep
we
dig
their
graves
but
rise
in
an
awful
resurrection
when
we
are
old
old
silence
then
a
tremulous
renewal
of
his
painful
speech
violet
held
her
breath
to
listen
possibly
the
doctor
hidden
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
room
did
so
also
i
never
knew
how
she
became
acquainted
with
the
terms
of
her
s
will
he
certainly
never
confided
them
to
her
and
as
certainly
the
lawyer
who
drew
up
the
document
never
did
but
that
she
was
well
aware
of
its
tenor
is
as
positive
a
fact
as
that
i
am
the
most
wretched
man
alive
tonight
otherwise
why
the
darksome
deed
into
which
she
was
betrayed
when
both
the
brothers
lay
dying
among
strangers
of
a
dreadful
accident
i
was
witness
to
that
deed
i
had
accompanied
her
on
her
hurried
ride
and
was
at
her
side
when
she
entered
the
inn
where
the
two
postlethwaites
lay
i
was
always
at
her
side
in
great
joy
or
in
great
trouble
though
she
professed
no
affection
for
me
and
gave
me
but
scanty
during
our
ride
she
had
been
silent
and
i
had
not
disturbed
that
silence
i
had
much
to
think
of
should
we
find
him
living
or
should
we
find
him
dead
if
dead
would
it
sever
the
relations
between
us
two
would
i
ever
ride
with
her
again
when
i
was
not
dwelling
on
this
theme
i
was
thinking
of
the
parting
look
she
gave
her
boy
a
look
which
had
some
strange
promise
in
it
what
had
that
look
meant
and
why
did
my
flesh
creep
and
my
mind
hover
between
dread
and
a
fearsome
curiosity
when
i
recalled
it
alas
there
was
reason
for
all
these
sensations
as
i
was
soon
to
learn
we
found
the
inn
seething
with
terror
and
the
facts
worse
than
had
been
represented
in
the
telegram
her
husband
was
dying
she
had
come
just
in
time
to
witness
the
end
this
they
told
her
before
she
had
taken
off
her
veil
if
they
had
waited
if
i
had
been
given
a
full
glimpse
of
her
face
but
it
was
hidden
and
i
could
only
judge
of
the
nature
of
her
emotions
by
the
stern
way
in
which
she
held
herself
take
me
to
him
was
the
quiet
command
with
which
she
met
this
disclosure
then
before
any
of
them
could
move
and
his
brother
andrew
postlethwaite
is
he
fatally
injured
too
the
reply
was
unequivocal
the
doctors
were
uncertain
which
of
the
two
would
pass
away
first
you
must
remember
that
at
this
time
i
was
ignorant
of
the
rich
man
s
will
and
consequently
of
how
the
fate
of
a
poor
child
of
whom
i
had
heard
only
one
mention
hung
in
the
balance
at
that
awful
moment
but
in
the
breathlessness
which
seized
postlethwaite
at
this
sentence
of
double
death
i
realized
from
my
knowledge
of
her
that
something
more
than
grief
was
at
prey
upon
her
impenetrable
heart
and
shuddered
to
the
core
of
my
being
when
she
repeated
in
that
voice
which
was
so
terrible
because
so
expressionless
take
me
to
they
were
lying
in
one
room
her
husband
nearest
the
door
the
other
in
a
small
alcove
some
ten
feet
away
both
were
unconscious
both
were
surrounded
by
groups
of
frightened
attendants
who
fell
back
as
she
approached
a
doctor
stood
at
the
of
her
husband
but
as
her
eye
met
his
he
stepped
aside
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
left
the
place
empty
for
her
the
action
was
significant
i
saw
that
she
understood
what
it
meant
and
with
constricted
heart
watched
her
as
she
bent
over
the
dying
man
and
gazed
into
his
eyes
already
sightless
and
staring
calculation
was
in
her
look
and
calculation
only
and
calculation
or
something
equally
unintelligible
sent
her
next
glance
in
the
direction
of
his
brother
what
was
in
her
mind
i
could
understand
her
indifference
to
frank
even
at
the
crisis
of
his
fate
but
not
the
interest
she
showed
in
andrew
it
was
an
absorbing
one
altering
her
whole
expression
i
no
longer
knew
her
for
my
dear
young
madam
and
the
jealousy
i
had
never
felt
towards
frank
rose
to
frantic
resentment
in
my
breast
as
i
beheld
what
very
likely
might
be
a
tardy
recognition
of
the
other
s
passion
forced
into
disclosure
by
the
exigencies
of
the
moment
alarmed
by
the
strength
of
my
feelings
and
fearing
an
equal
disclosure
on
my
own
part
i
sought
for
a
refuge
from
all
eyes
and
found
it
in
a
little
balcony
opening
out
at
my
right
on
to
this
balcony
i
stepped
and
found
myself
face
to
face
with
a
heaven
had
i
only
been
content
with
my
isolation
and
the
splendour
of
the
spectacle
spread
out
before
me
but
no
i
must
look
back
upon
that
bed
and
the
solitary
woman
standing
beside
it
i
must
watch
the
settling
of
her
body
into
rigidity
as
a
voice
rose
from
beside
the
other
postlethwaite
saying
it
is
a
matter
of
minutes
now
and
then
and
then
the
slow
creeping
of
her
hand
to
her
husband
s
mouth
the
outspreading
of
her
palm
across
the
livid
lips
its
steady
clinging
there
smothering
the
feeble
gasps
of
one
already
moribund
till
the
quivering
form
grew
still
and
frank
postlethwaite
lay
dead
before
my
eyes
i
saw
and
made
no
outcry
but
she
did
bringing
the
doctor
back
to
her
side
with
the
startled
exclamation
dead
i
thought
he
had
an
hour
s
life
left
in
him
and
he
has
passed
before
his
i
thought
it
hate
the
murderous
impulse
of
a
woman
who
sees
her
enemy
at
her
mercy
and
can
no
longer
restrain
the
passion
of
her
antagonism
and
while
something
within
me
rebelled
at
the
act
i
could
not
betray
her
though
silence
made
a
murderer
of
me
too
i
could
not
her
spell
was
upon
me
as
in
another
instant
it
was
upon
everyone
else
in
the
room
no
suspicion
of
one
so
in
her
sadness
disturbed
the
universal
sympathy
and
encouraged
by
this
blindness
of
the
crowd
i
vowed
within
myself
never
to
reveal
her
secret
the
man
was
dead
or
as
good
as
dead
when
she
touched
him
and
now
that
her
hate
was
expended
she
would
grow
gentle
and
good
but
i
knew
the
worthlessness
of
this
hope
as
well
as
my
misconception
of
her
motive
when
frank
s
child
by
another
wife
returned
to
my
memory
and
bella
s
sin
stood
but
only
to
myself
i
alone
knew
that
the
fortune
now
wholly
hers
and
in
consequence
her
boy
s
had
been
won
by
a
crime
that
if
her
hand
had
fallen
in
comfort
on
her
husband
s
forehead
instead
of
in
pressure
on
his
mouth
he
would
have
outlived
his
brother
long
enough
to
have
become
owner
of
his
millions
in
which
case
a
rightful
portion
would
have
been
insured
to
his
daughter
now
left
a
penniless
waif
the
thought
made
my
hair
rise
as
the
proceedings
over
i
faced
her
and
made
my
first
and
last
effort
to
rid
my
conscience
of
its
new
and
intolerable
burden
but
the
woman
i
had
known
and
loved
was
no
longer
before
me
the
crown
had
touched
her
brows
and
her
charm
which
had
been
mainly
sexual
up
to
this
hour
had
merged
into
an
intellectual
force
with
which
few
men
s
mentality
could
cope
mine
yielded
at
once
to
it
from
the
first
instant
i
knew
that
a
slavery
of
spirit
as
well
as
of
heart
was
henceforth
to
be
mine
she
did
not
wait
for
me
to
speak
she
had
assumed
the
dictator
s
attitude
at
once
i
know
of
what
you
are
thinking
said
she
and
it
is
a
subject
you
may
dismiss
at
once
from
your
mind
postlethwaite
s
child
by
his
first
wife
is
coming
to
live
with
us
i
have
expressed
my
wishes
in
this
regard
to
my
lawyer
and
there
is
nothing
left
to
be
said
you
with
your
close
mouth
and
dependable
nature
are
to
remain
here
as
before
and
occupy
the
same
position
towards
my
boy
that
you
did
towards
his
father
we
shall
move
soon
into
a
larger
house
and
the
nature
of
our
duties
will
be
changed
and
their
scope
greatly
increased
but
i
know
that
you
can
be
trusted
to
enlarge
with
them
and
meet
every
requirement
i
shall
see
fit
to
make
do
not
try
to
express
your
thanks
i
see
them
in
your
did
she
or
just
the
last
feeble
struggle
my
conscience
was
making
to
break
the
bonds
in
which
she
held
me
and
win
back
my
own
respect
i
shall
never
know
for
she
left
me
on
completion
of
this
speech
not
to
resume
the
subject
then
or
ever
but
though
i
succumbed
outwardly
to
her
demands
i
had
not
passed
the
point
where
inner
conflict
ends
and
peace
begins
her
recognition
of
helena
and
her
reception
into
the
family
calmed
me
for
a
while
and
gave
me
hope
that
all
would
yet
be
well
but
i
had
never
sounded
the
full
bitterness
of
madam
s
morbid
heart
well
as
i
thought
i
knew
it
the
hatred
she
had
felt
from
the
first
for
her
husband
s
child
ripened
into
frenzied
dislike
when
she
found
her
a
living
image
of
the
mother
whose
picture
she
had
come
across
among
frank
s
personal
effects
to
win
a
tear
from
those
meek
eyes
instead
of
a
smile
to
the
sensitive
lips
was
her
daily
play
she
seemed
to
exult
in
the
joy
of
impressing
upon
the
girl
by
how
little
she
had
missed
a
great
fortune
and
i
have
often
thought
much
as
i
tried
to
keep
my
mind
free
from
all
extravagant
and
unnecessary
fancies
that
half
of
the
money
she
spent
in
beautifying
this
house
and
maintaining
art
industries
and
even
great
charitable
institutions
was
spent
with
the
base
purpose
of
demonstrating
to
this
child
the
power
of
immense
wealth
and
in
what
ways
she
might
expect
to
see
her
little
brother
expend
the
millions
in
which
she
had
been
denied
all
share
i
was
so
sure
of
this
that
one
night
while
i
was
winding
up
the
clocks
with
which
postlethwaite
in
her
fondness
for
old
timepieces
has
filled
the
house
i
stopped
to
look
at
the
little
figure
toiling
so
wearily
upstairs
to
bed
without
a
mother
s
kiss
there
was
an
appeal
in
the
small
wistful
face
which
smote
my
hard
old
heart
and
possibly
a
tear
welled
up
in
my
own
eye
when
i
turned
back
to
my
was
that
why
i
felt
the
hand
of
providence
upon
me
when
in
my
halt
before
the
one
clock
to
which
any
superstitious
interest
was
attached
the
great
one
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
saw
that
it
had
stopped
and
at
the
one
minute
of
all
minutes
in
our
wretched
lives
four
minutes
past
two
the
hour
the
minute
in
which
frank
postlethwaite
had
gasped
his
last
under
the
pressure
of
his
wife
s
hand
i
knew
it
the
exact
minute
i
mean
because
providence
meant
that
i
should
know
it
there
had
been
a
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
of
the
hotel
room
where
he
and
his
brother
had
died
and
i
had
seen
her
glance
steal
towards
it
at
the
instant
she
withdrew
her
palm
from
her
husband
s
lips
the
stare
of
that
dial
and
the
position
of
its
hands
had
lived
still
in
my
mind
as
i
believed
it
did
in
hers
four
minutes
past
two
how
came
our
old
timepiece
here
to
stop
at
that
exact
moment
on
a
day
when
duty
was
making
its
last
demand
upon
me
to
remember
frank
s
unhappy
child
there
was
no
one
to
answer
but
as
i
looked
and
looked
i
felt
the
impulse
of
the
moment
strengthen
into
purpose
to
leave
those
hands
undisturbed
in
their
silent
accusation
she
might
see
and
moved
by
the
coincidence
tremble
at
her
treatment
of
helena
but
if
this
happened
if
she
saw
and
trembled
she
gave
no
sign
the
works
were
started
up
by
some
other
hand
and
the
incident
passed
but
it
left
me
with
an
idea
that
clock
soon
had
a
way
of
stopping
and
always
at
that
one
instant
of
time
she
was
forced
at
length
to
notice
it
and
i
remember
an
occasion
when
she
stood
with
her
eyes
on
those
hands
and
failed
to
find
the
banister
with
her
hand
though
she
groped
for
it
in
her
frantic
need
for
support
but
no
command
came
from
her
to
remove
the
piece
and
soon
its
tricks
and
every
lesser
thing
were
forgotten
in
the
crushing
calamity
which
befell
us
in
the
sickness
and
death
of
little
richard
oh
those
days
and
nights
and
oh
the
face
of
the
mother
when
the
doctors
told
her
that
the
case
was
hopeless
i
asked
myself
then
and
i
have
asked
myself
a
hundred
times
since
which
of
all
the
emotions
i
saw
pictured
there
bit
the
deepest
and
made
the
most
lasting
impression
on
her
guilty
heart
was
it
remorse
if
so
she
showed
no
change
in
her
attitude
towards
helena
unless
it
was
by
an
added
bitterness
the
sweet
looks
and
gentle
ways
of
frank
s
young
daughter
could
not
win
against
a
hate
sharpened
by
disappointment
useless
for
me
to
hope
for
it
release
from
the
remorse
of
years
was
not
to
come
in
that
way
as
i
realized
this
i
grew
desperate
and
resorted
again
to
the
old
trick
of
stopping
the
clock
at
the
fatal
hour
this
time
her
guilty
heart
responded
she
acknowledged
the
stab
and
let
all
her
miseries
appear
but
how
in
a
way
to
wring
my
heart
almost
to
madness
and
not
benefit
the
child
at
all
she
had
her
first
stroke
that
night
i
had
made
her
a
helpless
invalid
that
was
eight
years
ago
and
since
then
what
stagnation
she
lived
with
her
memories
and
i
with
mine
helena
only
had
a
right
to
hope
and
hope
perhaps
she
did
till
is
that
the
great
clock
talking
listen
they
all
talk
but
i
heed
only
the
one
what
does
it
say
tell
tell
tell
does
it
think
i
will
be
silent
now
when
i
come
to
my
own
guilt
that
i
will
seek
to
hide
my
weakness
when
i
could
not
hide
her
sin
explain
it
was
violet
speaking
and
her
tone
was
stern
in
its
command
of
what
guilt
do
you
speak
not
of
guilt
towards
helena
you
pitied
her
too
much
but
i
pitied
my
dear
madam
more
it
was
that
which
affected
me
and
drew
me
into
crime
against
my
will
besides
i
did
not
know
not
at
first
what
was
in
the
little
bowl
of
curds
and
cream
i
carried
to
the
girl
each
day
she
had
eaten
them
in
her
s
room
and
under
her
s
eye
as
long
as
she
had
strength
to
pass
from
room
to
room
and
how
was
i
to
guess
that
it
was
not
wholesome
because
she
failed
in
health
from
day
to
day
was
not
my
dear
madam
failing
in
health
also
and
was
there
poison
in
her
cup
innocent
at
that
time
why
am
i
not
innocent
now
because
oh
i
will
tell
it
all
as
though
at
the
bar
of
god
i
will
tell
all
the
secrets
of
that
day
she
was
sitting
with
her
hand
trembling
on
the
tray
from
which
i
had
just
lifted
the
bowl
she
had
bid
me
carry
to
helena
i
had
seen
her
so
a
hundred
times
before
but
not
with
just
that
look
in
her
eyes
or
just
that
air
of
desolation
in
her
stony
figure
something
made
me
speak
something
made
me
ask
if
she
were
not
quite
so
well
as
usual
and
something
made
her
reply
with
the
dreadful
truth
that
the
doctor
had
given
her
just
two
months
more
to
live
my
fright
and
mad
anguish
stupefied
me
for
i
was
not
prepared
for
this
no
not
at
all
and
unconsciously
i
stared
down
at
the
bowl
i
held
unable
to
breathe
or
move
or
even
to
meet
her
as
usual
she
misinterpreted
my
emotion
why
do
you
stand
like
that
i
heard
her
say
in
a
tone
of
great
irritation
and
why
do
you
stare
into
that
bowl
do
you
think
i
mean
to
leave
that
child
to
walk
these
halls
after
i
am
carried
out
of
them
forever
do
you
measure
my
hate
by
such
a
petty
as
that
i
tell
you
that
i
would
rot
above
ground
rather
than
enter
it
before
she
did
i
had
believed
i
knew
this
woman
but
what
soul
ever
knows
another
s
what
soul
ever
knows
itself
bella
i
cried
the
first
time
i
had
ever
presumed
to
address
her
so
intimately
would
you
poison
the
girl
and
from
sheer
weakness
my
fingers
lost
their
clutch
and
the
bowl
fell
to
the
floor
breaking
into
a
dozen
pieces
for
a
minute
she
stared
down
at
these
from
over
her
tray
and
then
she
remarked
very
low
and
very
quietly
another
bowl
humphrey
and
fresh
curds
from
the
kitchen
i
will
do
the
seasoning
the
doses
are
too
small
to
be
skipped
you
won
t
i
had
shaken
my
head
but
you
will
it
will
not
be
the
first
time
you
have
gone
down
the
hall
with
this
but
that
was
before
i
knew
i
began
and
now
that
you
do
you
will
go
just
the
then
as
i
stood
hesitating
a
thousand
memories
overwhelming
me
in
an
instant
she
added
in
a
voice
to
tear
the
heart
do
not
make
me
hate
the
only
being
left
in
this
world
who
understands
and
loves
she
was
a
helpless
invalid
and
i
a
broken
man
but
when
that
word
love
fell
from
her
lips
i
felt
the
blood
start
burning
in
my
veins
and
all
the
crust
of
habit
and
years
of
loosen
about
my
heart
and
make
me
young
again
what
if
her
thoughts
were
dark
and
her
wishes
murderous
she
was
born
to
rule
and
sway
men
to
her
will
even
to
their
own
i
wish
i
might
kiss
your
hand
was
what
i
murmured
gazing
at
her
white
fingers
groping
over
her
tray
you
may
she
answered
and
hell
became
heaven
to
me
for
a
brief
instant
then
i
lifted
myself
and
went
obediently
about
my
task
but
puppet
though
i
was
i
was
not
utterly
without
sympathy
when
i
entered
helena
s
room
and
saw
how
her
startled
eyes
fell
shrinkingly
on
the
bowl
i
set
down
before
her
my
conscience
leaped
to
life
and
i
could
not
help
saying
don
t
you
like
the
curds
helena
your
brother
used
to
love
them
very
his
were
what
helena
what
these
are
not
she
murmured
i
stared
at
her
so
she
knew
and
yet
did
not
seize
the
bowl
and
empty
it
out
of
the
window
instead
her
hand
moved
slowly
towards
it
and
drew
it
into
place
before
her
yet
i
must
eat
she
said
lifting
her
eyes
to
mine
in
a
sort
of
patient
despair
which
yet
was
without
accusation
but
my
hand
had
instinctively
gone
to
hers
and
grasped
it
why
must
you
eat
it
i
asked
if
if
you
do
not
find
it
wholesome
why
do
you
touch
it
because
my
expects
me
to
she
cried
and
i
have
no
other
will
than
hers
when
i
was
a
little
little
child
my
father
made
me
promise
that
if
i
ever
came
to
live
with
her
i
would
obey
her
simplest
wish
and
i
always
have
i
will
not
disappoint
the
trust
he
put
in
even
if
you
die
of
it
i
do
not
know
whether
i
whispered
these
words
or
only
thought
them
she
answered
as
though
i
had
spoken
i
am
not
afraid
to
die
i
am
more
afraid
to
live
she
may
ask
me
some
day
to
do
something
i
feel
to
be
when
i
fled
down
the
hall
that
night
i
heard
one
of
the
small
clocks
speak
to
me
tell
it
cried
tell
tell
tell
tell
i
rushed
away
from
it
with
beaded
forehead
and
rising
hair
then
another
s
note
piped
up
no
it
droned
no
no
no
no
i
stopped
and
took
heart
disgrace
the
woman
i
loved
on
the
brink
of
the
grave
i
who
asked
no
other
boon
from
heaven
than
to
see
her
happy
gracious
and
good
impossible
i
would
obey
the
great
clock
s
voice
the
others
were
mere
chatterboxes
but
it
has
at
last
changed
its
tune
for
some
reason
quite
changed
its
tune
now
it
is
yes
yes
instead
of
no
and
in
obeying
it
i
save
helena
but
what
of
bella
and
o
god
what
of
myself
a
sigh
a
groan
then
a
long
and
heavy
silence
into
which
there
finally
broke
the
pealing
of
the
various
clocks
striking
the
hour
when
all
were
still
again
and
violet
had
drawn
aside
the
portiere
it
was
to
see
the
old
man
on
his
knees
and
between
her
and
the
thin
streak
of
light
entering
from
the
hall
the
figure
of
the
doctor
hastening
to
helena
s
bedside
when
with
inducements
needless
to
name
they
finally
persuaded
the
young
girl
to
leave
her
unholy
habitation
it
was
in
the
arms
which
had
upheld
her
once
before
and
to
a
life
which
promised
to
compensate
her
for
her
twenty
years
of
loneliness
and
unsatisfied
longing
but
a
black
shadow
yet
remained
which
she
must
cross
before
reaching
the
sunshine
it
lay
at
her
s
door
in
the
plans
made
for
helena
s
release
postlethwaite
s
consent
had
not
been
obtained
nor
was
she
supposed
to
be
acquainted
with
the
doctor
s
intentions
towards
the
child
whose
death
she
was
hourly
awaiting
it
was
therefore
with
an
astonishment
bordering
on
awe
that
on
their
way
downstairs
they
saw
the
door
of
her
room
open
and
herself
standing
alone
and
upright
on
the
threshold
she
who
had
not
been
seen
to
take
a
step
in
years
in
the
wonder
of
this
miracle
of
suddenly
restored
power
the
little
procession
stopped
the
doctor
with
his
hand
upon
the
rail
the
lover
with
his
burden
clasped
yet
more
protectingly
to
his
breast
that
a
little
speech
awaited
them
could
be
seen
from
the
force
and
fury
of
the
gaze
which
the
indomitable
woman
bent
upon
the
lax
and
figure
she
beheld
thus
sheltered
and
conveyed
having
but
one
arrow
left
in
her
exhausted
quiver
she
launched
it
straight
at
the
innocent
breast
which
had
never
harboured
against
her
a
defiant
thought
ingrate
was
the
word
she
hurled
in
a
voice
from
which
all
its
seductive
music
had
gone
forever
where
are
you
going
are
they
carrying
you
alive
to
your
grave
a
moan
from
helena
s
pale
lips
then
silence
she
had
fainted
at
that
barbed
attack
but
there
was
one
there
who
dared
to
answer
for
her
and
he
spoke
relentlessly
it
was
the
man
who
loved
her
no
madam
we
are
carrying
her
to
safety
you
must
know
what
i
mean
by
that
let
her
go
quietly
and
you
may
die
in
peace
otherwise
she
interrupted
him
with
a
loud
call
startling
into
life
the
echoes
of
that
haunted
hall
humphrey
come
to
me
humphrey
but
no
humphrey
appeared
another
call
louder
and
more
peremptory
than
before
humphrey
i
say
humphrey
but
the
answer
was
the
same
silence
and
only
silence
as
the
horror
of
this
grew
the
doctor
spoke
mr
humphrey
dunbar
s
ears
are
closed
to
all
earthly
summons
he
died
last
night
at
the
very
hour
he
said
he
would
four
minutes
after
four
minutes
after
two
it
came
from
her
lips
in
a
whisper
but
with
a
revelation
of
her
broken
heart
and
life
four
minutes
after
two
and
defiant
to
the
last
her
head
rose
and
for
an
instant
for
a
mere
breath
of
time
they
saw
her
as
she
had
looked
in
her
prime
regal
in
form
attitude
and
expression
then
the
will
which
had
sustained
her
through
so
much
faltered
and
succumbed
and
with
a
final
reiteration
of
the
words
four
minutes
after
two
she
broke
into
a
rattling
laugh
and
fell
back
into
the
arms
of
her
old
nurse
and
below
one
clock
struck
the
hour
and
then
another
but
not
the
big
one
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
that
still
stood
silent
with
its
hands
pointing
to
the
hour
and
minute
of
frank
postlethwaite

hastened
death

vii
the
doctor
his
wife
and
the
clock
violet
had
gone
to
her
room
she
had
a
task
before
her
that
afternoon
a
packet
had
been
left
at
the
door
which
from
a
certain
letter
scribbled
in
one
corner
she
knew
to
be
from
her
employer
the
contents
of
that
packet
must
be
read
and
she
had
made
herself
comfortable
with
the
intention
of
setting
to
work
at
once
but
ten
o
clock
struck
and
then
eleven
before
she
could
bring
herself
to
give
any
attention
to
the
manuscript
awaiting
her
perusal
in
her
present
mood
a
quiet
sitting
by
the
fire
with
her
eyes
upon
the
changeful
flame
was
preferable
to
the
study
of
any
affair
her
employer
might
send
her
yet
because
she
was
conscious
of
the
duty
she
thus
openly
neglected
she
sat
crouched
over
her
desk
with
her
hand
on
the
mysterious
packet
the
string
of
which
however
she
made
no
effort
to
loosen
what
was
she
thinking
of
we
are
not
alone
in
our
curiosity
on
this
subject
her
brother
arthur
coming
unperceived
into
the
room
gives
tokens
of
a
similar
interest
never
before
had
he
seen
her
oblivious
to
an
approaching
step
and
after
a
momentary
contemplation
of
her
absorbed
figure
so
girlishly
sweet
and
yet
so
deeply
intent
he
advances
to
her
side
and
peering
earnestly
into
her
face
observes
with
a
seriousness
quite
unusual
to
him
puss
you
are
looking
worried
not
like
yourself
at
all
i
ve
noticed
it
for
some
time
what
s
up
getting
tired
of
the
business
no
not
altogether
that
is
it
s
not
that
if
it
s
anything
i
m
not
sure
that
it
s
anything
i
she
had
turned
back
to
her
desk
and
was
pushing
about
the
various
articles
with
which
it
was
plentifully
bespread
but
this
did
not
hide
the
flush
which
had
crept
into
her
cheeks
and
even
dyed
the
snowy
whiteness
of
her
neck
arthur
s
astonishment
at
this
evidence
of
emotion
was
very
great
but
he
said
nothing
only
watched
her
still
more
closely
as
with
a
light
laugh
she
regained
her
and
with
the
practical
air
of
a
philosopher
uttered
this
trite
remark
everyone
has
his
sober
moments
i
was
only
thinking
of
some
new
case
not
the
words
came
softly
but
with
a
touch
of
mingled
humour
and
gravity
which
made
arthur
stare
again
see
here
puss
he
cried
his
tone
had
changed
i
ve
just
come
up
from
the
den
father
and
i
have
had
a
row
a
beastly
a
row
you
and
father
oh
arthur
i
don
t
like
that
don
t
quarrel
with
father
don
t
don
t
some
day
he
and
i
may
have
a
serious
difference
about
what
i
am
doing
don
t
let
him
feel
that
he
has
lost
us
that
s
all
right
puss
but
i
ve
got
to
think
of
you
a
bit
i
can
t
see
you
spoil
all
your
good
times
with
these
police
horrors
and
not
do
something
to
help
i
begin
life
as
a
salesman
in
clarke
stebbin
s
the
salary
is
not
great
but
every
little
helps
and
i
don
t
dislike
the
business
but
father
does
he
had
rather
see
me
loafing
about
town
setting
the
fashions
for
fellows
as
idle
as
myself
than
soil
my
hands
with
handling
merchandise
that
s
why
we
quarreled
but
don
t
worry
your
name
didn
t
come
up
or
or
you
know
whose
he
hasn
t
an
idea
of
why
i
want
to
work
there
violet
there
two
soft
arms
were
around
his
neck
and
violet
was
letting
her
heart
out
in
a
succession
of
sisterly
kisses
o
arthur
you
good
good
boy
together
we
ll
soon
make
up
the
amount
and
then
then
what
a
sweet
soft
look
robbed
her
face
of
its
piquancy
but
gave
it
an
aspect
of
indescribable
beauty
quite
new
to
arthur
s
eyes
tapping
his
lips
with
a
thoughtful
forefinger
he
asked
who
was
that
chap
i
saw
bowing
to
you
as
we
came
out
of
church
last
sunday
she
awoke
from
her
dreamy
state
with
an
astonishing
quickness
he
surely
you
remember
him
have
you
forgotten
that
evening
in
massachusetts
the
grotto
and
oh
it
s
upjohn
is
it
yes
i
remember
him
he
s
fond
of
church
isn
t
he
that
is
when
he
s
in
new
her
lips
took
a
roguish
curve
then
a
very
serious
one
but
she
made
no
answer
i
have
noticed
that
he
s
always
in
his
seat
and
always
looking
your
that
s
very
odd
of
him
she
declared
her
dimples
coming
and
going
in
a
most
bewildering
fashion
i
can
t
imagine
why
he
should
do
nor
i
retorted
arthur
with
a
smile
but
he
s
human
i
suppose
only
do
be
careful
violet
a
man
so
melancholy
will
need
a
deal
of
he
was
gone
before
he
had
fully
finished
this
daring
remark
and
violet
left
again
with
her
thoughts
lost
her
glowing
colour
but
not
her
preoccupation
the
hand
which
lay
upon
the
packet
already
alluded
to
did
not
move
for
many
minutes
and
when
she
roused
at
last
to
the
demands
of
her
employer
it
was
with
a
start
and
a
guilty
look
at
the
small
gold
clock
ticking
out
its
inexorable
reminder
he
will
want
an
answer
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
she
complained
to
herself
and
opening
the
packet
she
took
out
first
a
letter
and
then
a
mass
of
typewritten
manuscript
she
began
with
the
letter
which
was
as
characteristic
of
the
writer
as
all
the
others
she
had
had
from
his
hand
as
witness
you
probably
remember
the
hasbrouck
murder
or
perhaps
you
don
t
it
being
one
of
a
time
previous
to
your
interest
in
such
matters
but
whether
you
remember
it
or
not
i
beg
you
to
read
the
accompanying
summary
with
due
care
and
attention
to
business
when
you
have
well
mastered
it
with
all
its
details
please
communicate
with
me
in
any
manner
most
convenient
to
yourself
for
i
shall
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
then
which
you
may
be
glad
to
hear
if
as
you
have
lately
intimated
you
need
to
earn
but
one
or
two
more
substantial
rewards
in
order
to
cry
halt
to
the
pursuit
for
which
you
have
proved
yourself
so
well
qualified
the
story
in
deference
to
yourself
as
a
young
and
much
preoccupied
woman
has
been
written
in
a
way
to
interest
though
the
work
of
an
everyday
police
detective
you
will
find
in
it
no
lack
of
mystery
or
romance
and
if
at
the
end
you
perceive
that
it
runs
as
such
cases
frequently
do
up
against
a
perfectly
blank
wall
you
must
remember
that
openings
can
be
made
in
walls
and
that
the
loosening
of
one
weak
stone
from
its
appointed
place
sometimes
leads
to
the
downfall
of
all
so
much
for
the
letter
laying
it
aside
with
a
shrug
of
her
expressive
shoulders
violet
took
up
the
manuscript
let
us
take
it
up
too
it
runs
thus
on
the
of
july
a
tragedy
of
no
little
interest
occurred
in
one
of
the
residences
of
the
colonnade
in
lafayette
place
hasbrouck
a
well
known
and
highly
respected
citizen
was
attacked
in
his
room
by
an
unknown
assailant
and
shot
dead
before
assistance
could
reach
him
his
murderer
escaped
and
the
problem
offered
to
the
police
was
how
to
identify
this
person
who
by
some
happy
chance
or
by
the
exercise
of
the
most
remarkable
forethought
had
left
no
traces
behind
him
or
any
clue
by
which
he
could
be
followed
the
details
of
the
investigation
which
ended
so
unsatisfactorily
are
here
given
by
the
man
sent
from
headquarters
at
the
first
alarm
when
some
time
after
midnight
on
the
date
above
mentioned
i
reached
lafayette
place
i
found
the
block
lighted
from
end
to
end
groups
of
excited
men
and
women
peered
from
the
open
doorways
and
mingled
their
shadows
with
those
of
the
huge
pillars
which
adorn
the
front
of
this
picturesque
block
of
dwellings
the
house
in
which
the
crime
had
been
committed
was
near
the
centre
of
the
row
and
long
before
i
reached
it
i
had
learned
from
more
than
one
source
that
the
alarm
was
first
given
to
the
street
by
a
woman
s
shriek
and
secondly
by
the
shouts
of
an
old
who
had
appeared
in
a
condition
at
the
window
of
hasbrouck
s
room
crying
murder
murder
but
when
i
had
crossed
the
threshold
i
was
astonished
at
the
paucity
of
facts
to
be
gleaned
from
the
inmates
themselves
the
old
servant
who
was
the
first
to
talk
had
only
this
account
of
the
crime
to
give
the
family
which
consisted
of
hasbrouck
his
wife
and
three
servants
had
retired
for
the
night
at
the
usual
hour
and
under
the
usual
auspices
at
eleven
o
clock
the
lights
were
all
extinguished
and
the
whole
household
asleep
with
the
possible
exception
of
hasbrouck
himself
who
being
a
man
of
large
business
responsibilities
was
frequently
troubled
with
insomnia
suddenly
hasbrouck
woke
with
a
start
had
she
dreamed
the
words
that
were
ringing
in
her
ears
or
had
they
been
actually
uttered
in
her
hearing
they
were
short
sharp
words
full
of
terror
and
menace
and
she
had
nearly
satisfied
herself
that
she
had
imagined
them
when
there
came
from
somewhere
near
the
door
a
sound
she
neither
understood
nor
could
interpret
but
which
filled
her
with
inexplicable
terror
and
made
her
afraid
to
breathe
or
even
to
stretch
forth
her
hand
towards
her
husband
whom
she
supposed
to
be
sleeping
at
her
side
at
length
another
strange
sound
which
she
was
sure
was
not
due
to
her
imagination
drove
her
to
make
an
attempt
to
rouse
him
when
she
was
horrified
to
find
that
she
was
alone
in
bed
and
her
husband
nowhere
within
reach
filled
now
with
something
more
than
nervous
apprehension
she
flung
herself
to
the
floor
and
tried
to
penetrate
with
frenzied
glances
the
surrounding
darkness
but
the
blinds
and
shutters
both
having
been
carefully
closed
by
hasbrouck
before
retiring
she
found
this
impossible
and
she
was
about
to
sink
in
terror
to
the
floor
when
she
heard
a
low
gasp
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
followed
by
a
suppressed
cry
god
what
have
i
done
the
voice
was
a
strange
one
but
before
the
fear
aroused
by
this
fact
could
culminate
in
a
shriek
of
dismay
she
caught
the
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
and
eagerly
listening
she
heard
them
descend
the
stairs
and
depart
by
the
front
door
had
she
known
what
had
occurred
had
there
been
no
doubt
in
her
mind
as
to
what
lay
in
the
darkness
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
it
is
likely
that
at
the
noise
caused
by
the
closing
front
door
she
would
have
made
at
once
for
the
balcony
that
opened
out
from
the
window
before
which
she
was
standing
and
taken
one
look
at
the
flying
figure
below
but
her
uncertainty
as
to
what
lay
hidden
from
her
by
the
darkness
chained
her
feet
to
the
floor
and
there
is
no
knowing
when
she
would
have
moved
if
a
carriage
had
not
at
that
moment
passed
down
astor
place
bringing
with
it
a
sense
of
companionship
which
broke
the
spell
holding
her
and
gave
her
strength
to
light
the
gas
which
was
in
ready
reach
of
her
hand
as
the
sudden
blaze
illuminated
the
room
revealing
in
a
burst
the
old
familiar
walls
and
pieces
of
furniture
she
felt
for
a
moment
as
if
released
from
some
heavy
nightmare
and
restored
to
the
common
experiences
of
life
but
in
another
instant
her
former
dread
returned
and
she
found
herself
quaking
at
the
prospect
of
passing
around
the
foot
of
the
bed
into
that
part
of
the
room
which
was
as
yet
hidden
from
her
eyes
but
the
desperation
which
comes
with
great
crises
finally
drove
her
from
her
retreat
and
creeping
slowly
forward
she
cast
one
glance
at
the
floor
before
her
when
she
found
her
worst
fears
realized
by
the
sight
of
the
dead
body
of
her
husband
lying
prone
before
the
open
doorway
with
a
in
his
forehead
her
first
impulse
was
to
shriek
but
by
a
powerful
exercise
of
will
she
checked
herself
and
ringing
frantically
for
the
servants
who
slept
on
the
top
floor
of
the
house
flew
to
the
nearest
window
and
endeavoured
to
open
it
but
the
shutters
had
been
bolted
so
securely
by
hasbrouck
in
his
endeavour
to
shut
out
all
light
and
sound
that
by
the
time
she
had
succeeded
in
unfastening
them
all
trace
of
the
flying
murderer
had
vanished
from
the
street
sick
with
grief
and
terror
she
stepped
back
into
the
room
just
as
the
three
frightened
servants
descended
the
stairs
as
they
appeared
in
the
open
doorway
she
pointed
at
her
husband
s
inanimate
form
and
then
as
if
suddenly
realizing
in
its
full
force
the
calamity
which
had
befallen
her
she
threw
up
her
arms
and
sank
forward
to
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
the
two
women
rushed
to
her
assistance
but
the
old
butler
bounding
over
the
bed
sprang
to
the
window
and
shrieked
his
alarm
to
the
street
in
the
interim
that
followed
hasbrouck
was
revived
and
the
master
s
body
laid
decently
on
the
bed
but
no
pursuit
was
made
nor
any
inquiries
started
likely
to
assist
me
in
establishing
the
identity
of
the
assailant
indeed
everyone
both
in
the
house
and
out
seemed
dazed
by
the
unexpected
catastrophe
and
as
no
one
had
any
suspicions
to
offer
as
to
the
probable
murderer
i
had
a
difficult
task
before
me
i
began
in
the
usual
way
by
inspecting
the
scene
of
the
murder
i
found
nothing
in
the
room
or
in
the
condition
of
the
body
itself
which
added
an
iota
to
the
knowledge
already
obtained
that
hasbrouck
had
been
in
bed
that
he
had
risen
upon
hearing
a
noise
and
that
he
had
been
shot
before
reaching
the
door
were
facts
but
there
was
nothing
to
guide
me
further
the
very
simplicity
of
the
circumstances
caused
a
dearth
of
clues
which
made
the
difficulty
of
procedure
as
great
as
any
i
had
ever
encountered
my
search
through
the
hall
and
down
the
stairs
elicited
nothing
and
an
investigation
of
the
bolts
and
bars
by
which
the
house
was
secured
assured
me
that
the
assassin
had
either
entered
by
the
front
door
or
had
already
been
secreted
in
the
house
when
it
was
locked
up
for
the
night
i
shall
have
to
trouble
hasbrouck
for
a
short
interview
i
hereupon
announced
to
the
trembling
old
servant
who
had
followed
me
like
a
dog
about
the
house
he
made
no
demur
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
was
ushered
into
the
presence
of
the
newly
made
widow
who
sat
quite
alone
in
a
large
chamber
in
the
rear
as
i
crossed
the
threshold
she
looked
up
and
i
encountered
a
good
plain
face
without
the
shadow
of
guile
in
it
madam
said
i
i
have
not
come
to
disturb
you
i
will
ask
two
or
three
questions
only
and
then
leave
you
to
your
grief
i
am
told
that
some
words
came
from
the
assassin
before
he
delivered
his
fatal
shot
did
you
hear
these
distinctly
enough
to
tell
me
what
they
were
i
was
sound
asleep
said
she
and
dreamt
as
i
thought
that
a
fierce
strange
voice
cried
somewhere
to
some
one
ah
you
did
not
expect
me
but
i
dare
not
say
that
these
words
were
really
uttered
to
my
husband
for
he
was
not
the
man
to
call
forth
hate
and
only
a
man
in
the
extremity
of
passion
could
address
such
an
exclamation
in
such
a
tone
as
rings
in
my
memory
in
connection
with
the
fatal
shot
which
woke
but
that
shot
was
not
the
work
of
a
friend
i
argued
if
as
these
words
seem
to
prove
the
assassin
had
some
other
motive
than
plunder
in
his
assault
then
your
husband
had
an
enemy
though
you
never
suspected
impossible
was
her
steady
reply
uttered
in
the
most
convincing
tone
the
man
who
shot
him
was
a
common
burglar
and
frightened
at
having
been
betrayed
into
murder
fled
without
looking
for
booty
i
am
sure
i
heard
him
cry
out
in
terror
and
remorse
god
what
have
i
done
was
that
before
you
left
the
side
of
the
bed
yes
i
did
not
move
from
my
place
till
i
heard
the
front
door
close
i
was
paralysed
by
fear
and
are
you
in
the
habit
of
trusting
to
the
security
of
a
only
in
the
fastening
of
your
front
door
at
night
i
am
told
that
the
big
key
was
not
in
the
lock
and
that
the
bolt
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
was
not
the
bolt
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
is
never
drawn
hasbrouck
was
so
good
a
man
that
he
never
mistrusted
any
one
that
is
why
the
big
lock
was
not
fastened
the
key
not
working
well
he
took
it
some
days
ago
to
the
locksmith
and
when
the
latter
failed
to
return
it
he
laughed
and
said
he
thought
no
one
would
ever
think
of
meddling
with
his
front
is
there
more
than
one
to
your
house
i
now
asked
she
shook
her
head
and
when
did
hasbrouck
last
use
his
when
he
came
home
from
prayer
meeting
she
answered
and
burst
into
tears
her
grief
was
so
real
and
her
loss
so
recent
that
i
hesitated
to
afflict
her
by
further
questions
so
returning
to
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
i
stepped
out
upon
the
balcony
which
ran
in
front
soft
voices
instantly
struck
my
ears
the
neighbours
on
either
side
were
grouped
in
front
of
their
own
windows
and
were
exchanging
the
remarks
natural
under
the
circumstances
i
paused
as
in
duty
bound
and
listened
but
i
heard
nothing
worth
recording
and
would
have
instantly
reentered
the
house
if
i
had
not
been
impressed
by
the
appearance
of
a
very
graceful
woman
who
stood
at
my
right
she
was
clinging
to
her
husband
who
was
gazing
at
one
of
the
pillars
before
him
in
a
strange
fixed
way
which
astonished
me
till
he
attempted
to
move
and
then
i
saw
that
he
was
blind
i
remembered
that
there
lived
in
this
row
a
blind
doctor
equally
celebrated
for
his
skill
and
for
his
uncommon
personal
attractions
and
greatly
interested
not
only
by
his
affliction
but
in
the
sympathy
evinced
by
his
young
and
affectionate
wife
i
stood
still
till
i
heard
her
say
in
the
soft
and
appealing
tones
of
love
come
in
constant
you
have
heavy
duties
for
and
you
should
get
a
few
hours
rest
if
he
came
from
the
shadow
of
the
pillar
and
for
one
minute
i
saw
his
face
with
the
lamplight
shining
full
upon
it
it
was
as
regular
of
feature
as
a
sculptured
adonis
and
it
was
as
white
sleep
he
repeated
in
the
measured
tones
of
deep
but
suppressed
feeling
sleep
with
murder
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
and
he
stretched
out
his
arms
in
a
dazed
way
that
insensibly
accentuated
the
horror
i
myself
felt
of
the
crime
which
had
so
lately
taken
place
in
the
room
behind
me
she
noting
the
movement
took
one
of
the
groping
hands
in
her
own
and
drew
him
gently
towards
her
this
way
she
urged
and
guiding
him
into
the
house
she
closed
the
window
and
drew
down
the
shades
i
have
no
excuse
to
offer
for
my
curiosity
but
the
interest
excited
in
me
by
this
totally
irrelevant
episode
was
so
great
that
i
did
not
leave
the
neighbourhood
till
i
had
learned
something
of
this
remarkable
couple
the
story
told
me
was
very
simple
zabriskie
had
not
been
born
blind
but
had
become
so
after
a
grievous
illness
which
had
stricken
him
down
soon
after
he
received
his
diploma
instead
of
succumbing
to
an
affliction
which
would
have
daunted
most
men
he
expressed
his
intention
of
practising
his
profession
and
soon
became
so
successful
in
it
that
he
found
no
difficulty
in
establishing
himself
in
one
of
the
best
paying
quarters
of
the
city
indeed
his
intuition
seemed
to
have
developed
in
a
remarkable
degree
after
the
loss
of
his
sight
and
he
seldom
if
ever
made
a
mistake
in
diagnosis
considering
this
fact
and
the
personal
attractions
which
gave
him
distinction
it
was
no
wonder
that
he
soon
became
a
popular
physician
whose
presence
was
a
benefaction
and
whose
word
law
he
had
been
engaged
to
be
married
at
the
time
of
his
illness
and
when
he
learned
what
was
likely
to
be
its
result
had
offered
to
release
the
young
lady
from
all
obligation
to
him
but
she
would
not
be
released
and
they
were
married
this
had
taken
place
some
five
years
previous
to
hasbrouck
s
death
three
of
which
had
been
spent
by
them
in
lafayette
place
so
much
for
the
beautiful
woman
next
door
there
being
absolutely
no
clue
to
the
assailant
of
hasbrouck
i
naturally
looked
forward
to
the
inquest
for
some
evidence
upon
which
to
work
but
there
seemed
to
be
no
underlying
facts
to
this
tragedy
the
most
careful
study
into
the
habits
and
conduct
of
the
deceased
brought
nothing
to
light
save
his
general
beneficence
and
rectitude
nor
was
there
in
his
history
or
in
that
of
his
wife
any
secret
or
hidden
obligation
calculated
to
provoke
any
such
act
of
revenge
as
murder
hasbrouck
s
surmise
that
the
intruder
was
simply
a
burglar
and
that
she
had
rather
imagined
than
heard
the
words
which
pointed
to
the
shooting
as
a
deed
of
vengeance
soon
gained
general
credence
but
though
the
police
worked
long
and
arduously
in
this
new
direction
their
efforts
were
without
fruit
and
the
case
bids
fair
to
remain
an
unsolvable
mystery
that
was
all
as
violet
dropped
the
last
page
from
her
hand
she
recalled
a
certain
phrase
in
her
employer
s
letter
if
at
the
end
you
come
upon
a
perfectly
blank
wall
well
she
had
come
upon
this
wall
did
he
expect
her
to
make
an
opening
in
it
or
had
he
already
done
so
himself
and
was
merely
testing
her
much
vaunted
discernment
piqued
by
the
thought
she
carefully
reread
the
manuscript
and
when
she
had
again
reached
its
uncompromising
end
she
gave
herself
up
to
a
few
minutes
of
concentrated
thought
then
taking
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
rack
before
her
she
wrote
upon
it
a
single
sentence
and
folding
the
sheet
put
it
in
an
envelope
which
she
left
unaddressed
this
done
she
went
to
bed
and
slept
like
the
child
she
really
was
at
an
early
hour
the
next
morning
she
entered
her
employer
s
office
acknowledging
with
a
nod
his
somewhat
ceremonious
bow
she
handed
him
the
envelope
in
which
she
had
enclosed
that
one
mysterious
sentence
he
took
it
with
a
smile
opened
it
offhand
glanced
at
what
she
had
written
and
flushed
a
vivid
red
you
are
a
brick
he
was
going
to
say
but
changed
the
last
word
to
one
more
in
keeping
with
her
character
and
appearance
look
here
i
expected
this
from
you
and
so
prepared
taking
out
a
similar
piece
of
paper
from
his
own
he
laid
it
down
beside
hers
on
the
desk
before
him
it
also
held
a
single
sentence
and
barring
a
slight
difference
of
expression
the
one
was
the
counterpart
of
the
other
the
one
loose
stone
he
murmured
seen
and
noted
by
why
not
he
asked
then
as
she
glanced
expectantly
his
way
he
earnestly
added
together
we
may
be
able
to
do
something
the
reward
offered
by
hasbrouck
for
the
detection
of
the
murderer
was
a
very
large
one
she
is
a
woman
of
means
i
have
never
heard
of
its
being
then
it
never
has
been
was
violet
s
emphatic
conclusion
her
dimples
enforcing
the
statement
as
only
such
dimples
can
but
what
do
you
want
of
me
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
something
more
than
to
help
you
locate
the
one
possible
clue
to
further
enlightenment
you
would
not
have
mentioned
the
big
reward
just
for
perhaps
not
there
is
a
sequel
to
the
story
i
sent
you
i
have
written
it
out
with
my
own
hand
take
it
home
and
read
it
at
your
leisure
when
you
see
into
what
an
unhappy
maze
my
own
inquiries
have
led
me
possibly
you
will
be
glad
to
assist
me
in
clearing
up
a
situation
which
is
inflicting
great
suffering
on
one
whom
you
will
be
the
first
to
pity
if
so
a
line
mentioning
the
fact
will
be
much
appreciated
by
and
disregarding
her
startled
look
and
the
impetuous
shaking
of
her
head
he
bowed
her
out
with
something
more
than
his
accustomed
suavity
but
also
with
a
seriousness
which
affected
her
in
spite
of
herself
and
effectually
held
back
the
protest
it
was
in
her
heart
to
make
she
was
glad
of
this
when
she
read
his
story
but
later
on
however
it
is
not
for
me
to
intrude
violet
or
violet
s
feelings
into
an
affair
which
she
is
so
anxious
to
forget
i
shall
therefore
from
this
moment
on
leave
her
as
completely
out
of
this
tale
of
crime
and
retribution
as
is
possible
and
keep
a
full
record
of
her
work
when
she
is
necessary
to
the
story
you
will
see
her
again
meanwhile
read
with
her
this
relation
of
her
employer
s
unhappy
attempt
to
pursue
an
investigation
so
openly
dropped
by
the
police
you
will
perceive
from
its
general
style
and
the
accentuation
put
upon
the
human
side
of
this
sombre
story
a
likeness
to
the
former
manuscript
which
may
prove
to
you
as
it
certainly
did
to
violet
to
whose
consideration
she
was
indebted
for
the
readableness
of
the
policeman
s
report
which
in
all
probability
had
been
a
simple
statement
of
facts
but
there
i
am
speaking
of
violet
again
to
prevent
a
further
mischance
of
this
nature
i
will
introduce
at
once
the
above
mentioned
account
ii
no
man
in
all
new
york
was
ever
more
interested
than
myself
in
the
hasbrouck
affair
when
it
was
the
one
and
only
topic
of
interest
at
a
period
when
news
was
unusually
scarce
but
together
with
many
such
inexplicable
mysteries
it
had
passed
almost
completely
from
my
mind
when
it
was
forcibly
brought
back
one
day
by
a
walk
i
took
through
lafayette
place
at
sight
of
the
long
row
of
uniform
buildings
with
their
pillared
fronts
and
connecting
balconies
every
detail
of
the
crime
which
had
filled
the
papers
at
the
time
with
innumerable
conjectures
returned
to
me
with
extraordinary
clearness
and
before
i
knew
it
i
found
myself
standing
stockstill
in
the
middle
of
the
block
with
my
eye
raised
to
the
hasbrouck
house
and
my
ears
or
rather
my
inner
consciousness
for
no
one
spoke
i
am
sure
ringing
with
a
question
which
whether
the
echo
of
some
old
thought
or
the
expression
of
a
new
one
so
affected
me
by
the
promise
it
held
of
some
hitherto
unsuspected
clue
that
i
hesitated
whether
to
push
this
new
inquiry
then
or
there
by
an
attempted
interview
with
hasbrouck
or
to
wait
till
i
had
given
it
the
thought
which
such
a
stirring
of
dead
bones
rightfully
demanded
you
know
what
that
question
was
i
shall
have
communicated
it
to
you
if
you
have
not
already
guessed
it
before
perusing
these
lines
who
uttered
the
scream
which
gave
the
first
alarm
of
hasbrouck
s
violent
death
i
was
in
a
state
of
such
excitement
as
i
walked
away
for
i
listened
to
my
better
judgment
as
to
the
inadvisability
of
my
disturbing
hasbrouck
with
these
new
inquiries
that
the
perspiration
stood
out
on
my
forehead
the
testimony
she
had
given
at
the
inquest
recurred
to
me
and
i
remembered
as
distinctly
as
if
she
were
then
speaking
that
she
had
expressly
stated
that
she
did
not
scream
when
confronted
by
the
sight
of
her
husband
s
dead
body
but
someone
had
screamed
and
that
very
loudly
who
was
it
then
one
of
the
maids
startled
by
the
sudden
summons
from
below
or
someone
else
some
involuntary
witness
of
the
crime
whose
testimony
had
been
suppressed
at
the
inquest
by
fear
or
influence
the
possibility
of
having
come
upon
a
clue
even
at
this
late
day
so
fired
my
ambition
that
i
took
the
first
opportunity
of
revisiting
lafayette
place
choosing
such
persons
as
i
thought
most
open
to
my
questions
i
learned
that
there
were
many
who
could
testify
to
having
heard
a
woman
s
shrill
scream
on
that
memorable
night
just
prior
to
the
alarm
given
by
old
cyrus
but
no
one
who
could
tell
from
whose
lips
it
had
come
one
fact
however
was
immediately
settled
it
had
not
been
the
result
of
the
s
fears
both
of
the
girls
were
positive
that
they
had
uttered
no
sound
nor
had
they
themselves
heard
any
till
cyrus
rushed
to
the
window
with
his
wild
cries
as
the
scream
by
whomever
given
was
uttered
before
they
descended
the
stairs
i
was
convinced
by
these
assurances
that
it
had
issued
from
one
of
the
front
windows
and
not
from
the
rear
of
the
house
where
their
own
rooms
lay
could
it
be
that
it
had
sprung
from
the
adjoining
dwelling
and
that
i
remembered
who
had
lived
there
and
was
for
ringing
the
bell
at
once
but
missing
the
doctor
s
sign
i
made
inquiries
and
found
that
he
had
moved
from
the
block
however
a
doctor
is
soon
found
and
in
less
than
fifteen
minutes
i
was
at
the
door
of
his
new
home
where
i
asked
not
for
him
but
for
zabriskie
it
required
some
courage
to
do
this
for
i
had
taken
particular
notice
of
the
doctor
s
wife
at
the
inquest
and
her
beauty
at
that
time
had
worn
such
an
aspect
of
mingled
sweetness
and
dignity
that
i
hesitated
to
encounter
it
under
any
circumstances
likely
to
disturb
its
pure
serenity
but
a
clue
once
grasped
can
not
be
lightly
set
aside
by
a
true
detective
and
it
would
have
taken
more
than
a
woman
s
frowns
to
stop
me
at
this
point
however
it
was
not
with
frowns
she
received
me
but
with
a
display
of
emotion
for
which
i
was
even
less
prepared
i
had
sent
up
my
card
and
i
saw
it
trembling
in
her
hand
as
she
entered
the
room
as
she
neared
me
she
glanced
at
it
and
with
a
show
of
gentle
indifference
which
did
not
in
the
least
disguise
her
extreme
anxiety
she
courteously
remarked
your
name
is
an
unfamiliar
one
to
me
but
you
told
my
maid
that
your
business
was
one
of
extreme
importance
and
so
i
have
consented
to
see
you
what
can
an
agent
from
a
private
detective
office
have
to
say
to
me
startled
by
this
evidence
of
the
existence
of
some
hidden
skeleton
in
her
own
closet
i
made
an
immediate
attempt
to
reassure
her
nothing
which
concerns
you
personally
said
i
i
simply
wish
to
ask
you
a
question
in
regard
to
a
small
matter
connected
with
hasbrouck
s
violent
death
in
lafayette
place
a
couple
of
years
ago
you
were
living
in
the
adjoining
house
at
the
time
i
believe
and
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
you
might
on
that
account
be
able
to
settle
a
point
which
has
never
been
fully
cleared
instead
of
showing
the
relief
i
expected
her
pallor
increased
and
her
fine
eyes
which
had
been
fixed
curiously
upon
me
sank
in
confusion
to
the
floor
great
heaven
thought
i
she
looks
as
if
at
one
more
word
from
me
she
would
fall
at
my
feet
in
a
faint
what
is
this
i
have
stumbled
upon
i
do
not
see
how
you
can
have
any
question
to
ask
me
on
that
subject
she
began
with
an
effort
at
composure
which
for
some
reason
disturbed
me
more
than
her
previous
open
display
of
fear
yet
if
you
have
she
continued
with
a
rapid
change
of
manner
that
touched
my
heart
in
spite
of
myself
i
shall
of
course
do
my
best
to
answer
there
are
women
whose
sweetest
tones
and
most
charming
smiles
only
serve
to
awaken
distrust
in
men
of
my
calling
but
zabriskie
was
not
of
this
number
her
face
was
beautiful
but
it
was
also
candid
in
its
expression
and
beneath
the
agitation
which
palpably
disturbed
her
i
was
sure
there
lurked
nothing
either
wicked
or
false
yet
i
held
fast
by
the
clue
which
i
had
grasped
as
it
were
in
the
dark
and
without
knowing
whither
i
was
tending
much
less
whither
i
was
leading
her
i
proceeded
to
say
the
question
which
i
presume
to
put
to
you
as
the
next
door
neighbour
of
hasbrouck
is
this
who
was
the
woman
who
on
the
night
of
that
gentleman
s
assassination
screamed
out
so
loudly
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
heard
her
the
gasp
she
gave
answered
my
question
in
a
way
she
little
realized
and
struck
as
i
was
by
the
impalpable
links
that
had
led
me
to
the
threshold
of
this
hitherto
unsolvable
mystery
i
was
about
to
press
my
advantage
and
ask
another
question
when
she
quickly
started
forward
and
laid
her
hand
on
my
lips
astonished
i
looked
at
her
inquiringly
but
her
head
was
turned
aside
and
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
door
showed
the
greatest
anxiety
instantly
i
realized
what
she
feared
her
husband
was
entering
the
house
and
she
dreaded
lest
his
ears
should
catch
a
word
of
our
conversation
not
knowing
what
was
in
her
mind
and
unable
to
realize
the
importance
of
the
moment
to
her
i
yet
listened
to
the
advance
of
her
blind
husband
with
an
almost
painful
interest
would
he
enter
the
room
where
we
were
or
would
he
pass
immediately
to
his
office
in
the
rear
she
seemed
to
wonder
too
and
almost
held
her
breath
as
he
neared
the
door
paused
and
stood
in
the
open
doorway
with
his
ear
turned
towards
us
as
for
myself
i
remained
perfectly
still
gazing
at
his
face
in
mingled
surprise
and
apprehension
for
besides
its
beauty
which
was
of
a
marked
order
as
i
have
already
observed
it
had
a
touching
expression
which
irresistibly
aroused
both
pity
and
interest
in
the
spectator
this
may
have
been
the
result
of
his
affliction
or
it
may
have
sprung
from
some
deeper
cause
but
whatever
its
source
this
look
in
his
face
produced
a
strong
impression
upon
me
and
interested
me
at
once
in
his
personality
would
he
enter
or
would
he
pass
on
her
look
of
silent
appeal
showed
me
in
which
direction
her
wishes
lay
but
while
i
answered
her
glance
by
complete
silence
i
was
conscious
in
some
indistinct
way
that
the
business
i
had
undertaken
would
be
better
furthered
by
his
entrance
the
blind
have
often
been
said
to
possess
a
sixth
sense
in
place
of
the
one
they
have
lost
though
i
am
sure
we
made
no
noise
i
soon
perceived
that
he
was
aware
of
our
presence
stepping
hastily
forward
he
said
in
the
high
and
vibrating
tone
of
restrained
passion
zulma
are
you
there
for
a
moment
i
thought
she
did
not
mean
to
answer
but
knowing
doubtless
from
experience
the
impossibility
of
deceiving
him
she
answered
with
a
cheerful
assent
dropping
her
hand
as
she
did
so
from
before
my
lips
he
heard
the
slight
rustle
which
accompanied
the
movement
and
a
look
i
found
it
hard
to
comprehend
flashed
over
his
features
altering
his
expression
so
completely
that
he
seemed
another
man
you
have
someone
with
you
he
declared
advancing
another
step
but
with
none
of
the
uncertainty
which
usually
accompanies
the
movements
of
the
blind
some
dear
friend
he
went
on
with
an
almost
sarcastic
emphasis
and
a
forced
smile
that
had
little
of
gaiety
in
it
the
agitated
and
distressed
blush
which
answered
him
could
have
but
one
interpretation
he
suspected
that
her
hand
had
been
clasped
in
mine
and
she
perceived
his
thought
and
knew
that
i
perceived
it
also
drawing
herself
up
she
moved
towards
him
saying
in
a
sweet
womanly
tone
it
is
no
friend
constant
not
even
an
acquaintance
the
person
whom
i
now
present
to
you
is
a
representative
from
some
detective
agency
he
is
here
upon
a
trivial
errand
which
will
soon
be
finished
when
i
will
join
you
in
the
i
knew
she
was
but
taking
a
choice
between
two
evils
that
she
would
have
saved
her
husband
the
knowledge
of
my
calling
as
well
as
of
my
presence
in
the
house
if
her
would
have
allowed
it
but
neither
she
nor
i
anticipated
the
effect
which
this
introduction
of
myself
in
my
business
capacity
would
produce
upon
him
a
detective
he
repeated
staring
with
his
sightless
eyes
as
if
in
his
eagerness
to
see
he
half
hoped
his
lost
sense
would
return
he
can
have
no
trivial
errand
here
he
has
been
sent
by
god
himself
to
let
me
speak
for
you
hastily
interposed
his
wife
springing
to
his
side
and
clasping
his
arm
with
a
fervour
that
was
equally
expressive
of
appeal
and
command
then
turning
to
me
she
explained
since
hasbrouck
s
unaccountable
death
my
husband
has
been
labouring
under
an
hallucination
which
i
have
only
to
mention
for
you
to
recognize
its
perfect
absurdity
he
thinks
oh
do
not
look
like
that
constant
you
know
it
is
an
hallucination
which
must
vanish
the
moment
we
drag
it
into
broad
daylight
that
he
he
the
best
man
in
all
the
world
was
himself
the
assailant
of
good
god
i
say
nothing
of
the
impossibility
of
this
being
so
she
went
on
in
a
fever
of
expostulation
he
is
blind
and
could
not
have
delivered
such
a
shot
even
if
he
had
desired
to
besides
he
had
no
weapon
but
the
inconsistency
of
the
thing
speaks
for
itself
and
should
assure
him
that
his
mind
is
unbalanced
and
that
he
is
merely
suffering
from
a
shock
that
was
greater
than
we
realized
he
is
a
physician
and
has
had
many
such
instances
in
his
own
practice
why
he
was
very
much
attached
to
hasbrouck
they
were
the
best
of
friends
and
though
he
insists
that
he
killed
him
he
can
not
give
any
reason
for
the
at
these
words
the
doctor
s
face
grew
stern
and
he
spoke
like
an
automaton
repeating
some
fearful
lesson
i
killed
him
i
went
to
his
room
and
deliberately
shot
him
i
had
nothing
against
him
and
my
remorse
is
extreme
arrest
me
and
let
me
pay
the
penalty
of
my
crime
it
is
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
obtain
shocked
beyond
all
power
of
by
this
repetition
of
what
she
evidently
considered
the
unhappy
ravings
of
a
madman
she
let
go
his
arm
and
turned
upon
me
in
frenzy
convince
him
she
cried
convince
him
by
your
questions
that
he
never
could
have
done
this
fearful
i
was
labouring
under
great
excitement
myself
for
as
a
private
agent
with
no
official
authority
such
as
he
evidently
attributed
to
me
in
the
blindness
of
his
passion
i
felt
the
incongruity
of
my
position
in
the
face
of
a
matter
of
such
tragic
consequence
besides
i
agreed
with
her
that
he
was
in
a
distempered
state
of
mind
and
i
hardly
knew
how
to
deal
with
one
so
fixed
in
his
hallucination
and
with
so
much
intelligence
to
support
it
but
the
emergency
was
great
for
he
was
holding
out
his
wrists
in
the
evident
expectation
of
my
taking
him
into
instant
custody
and
the
sight
was
killing
his
wife
who
had
sunk
on
the
floor
between
us
in
terror
and
anguish
you
say
you
killed
hasbrouck
i
began
where
did
you
get
your
pistol
and
what
did
you
do
with
it
after
you
left
his
house
my
husband
had
no
pistol
never
had
any
pistol
put
in
zabriskie
with
vehement
assertion
if
i
had
seen
him
with
such
a
weapon
i
threw
it
away
when
i
left
the
house
i
cast
it
as
far
from
me
as
possible
for
i
was
frightened
at
what
i
had
done
horribly
no
pistol
was
ever
found
i
answered
with
a
smile
forgetting
for
the
moment
that
he
could
not
see
if
such
an
instrument
had
been
found
in
the
street
after
a
murder
of
such
consequence
it
certainly
would
have
been
brought
to
the
you
forget
that
a
good
pistol
is
valuable
property
he
went
on
stolidly
someone
came
along
before
the
general
alarm
was
given
and
seeing
such
a
treasure
lying
on
the
sidewalk
picked
it
up
and
carried
it
off
not
being
an
honest
man
he
preferred
to
keep
it
to
drawing
the
attention
of
the
police
upon
hum
perhaps
said
i
but
where
did
you
get
it
surely
you
can
tell
where
you
procured
such
a
weapon
if
as
your
wife
intimates
you
did
not
own
i
bought
it
that
selfsame
night
of
a
friend
a
friend
whom
i
will
not
name
since
he
resides
no
longer
in
this
country
i
he
paused
intense
passion
was
in
his
face
he
turned
towards
his
wife
and
a
low
cry
escaped
him
which
made
her
look
up
in
fear
i
do
not
wish
to
go
into
any
particulars
said
he
god
forsook
me
and
i
committed
a
horrible
crime
when
i
am
punished
perhaps
peace
will
return
to
me
and
happiness
to
her
i
would
not
wish
her
to
suffer
too
long
or
too
bitterly
for
my
constant
what
love
was
in
the
cry
it
seemed
to
move
him
and
turn
his
thoughts
for
a
moment
into
a
different
channel
poor
child
he
murmured
stretching
out
his
hands
by
an
irresistible
impulse
towards
her
but
the
change
was
but
momentary
and
he
was
soon
again
the
stern
and
determined
are
you
going
to
take
me
before
a
magistrate
he
asked
if
so
i
have
a
few
duties
to
perform
which
you
are
welcome
to
this
was
too
much
i
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
me
to
disabuse
his
mind
of
the
impression
he
had
unwittingly
formed
of
me
i
therefore
said
as
considerately
as
i
could
you
mistake
my
position
zabriskie
though
a
detective
of
some
experience
i
have
no
connection
with
the
police
and
no
right
to
intrude
myself
in
a
matter
of
such
tragic
importance
if
however
you
are
as
anxious
as
you
say
to
subject
yourself
to
police
examination
i
will
mention
the
same
to
the
proper
authorities
and
leave
them
to
take
such
action
as
they
think
that
will
be
still
more
satisfactory
to
me
said
he
for
though
i
have
many
times
contemplated
giving
myself
up
i
have
still
much
to
do
before
i
can
leave
my
home
and
practice
without
injury
to
others
when
you
want
me
you
will
find
me
he
was
gone
and
the
poor
young
wife
was
left
crouching
on
the
floor
alone
pitying
her
shame
and
terror
i
ventured
to
remark
that
it
was
not
an
uncommon
thing
for
a
man
to
confess
to
a
crime
he
had
never
committed
and
assured
her
that
the
matter
would
be
inquired
into
very
carefully
before
any
attempt
was
made
upon
his
liberty
she
thanked
me
and
slowly
rising
tried
to
regain
her
equanimity
but
the
manner
as
well
as
the
matter
of
her
husband
s
was
too
overwhelming
in
its
nature
for
her
to
recover
readily
from
her
emotions
i
have
long
dreaded
this
she
acknowledged
for
months
i
have
foreseen
that
he
would
make
some
rash
communication
or
insane
avowal
if
i
had
dared
i
would
have
consulted
some
physician
about
this
hallucination
of
his
but
he
was
so
sane
on
other
points
that
i
hesitated
to
give
my
dreadful
secret
to
the
world
i
kept
hoping
that
time
and
his
daily
pursuits
would
have
their
effect
and
restore
him
to
himself
but
his
illusion
grows
and
now
i
fear
that
nothing
will
ever
convince
him
that
he
did
not
commit
the
deed
of
which
he
accuses
himself
if
he
were
not
blind
i
would
have
more
hope
but
the
blind
have
so
much
time
for
i
think
he
had
better
be
indulged
in
his
fancies
for
the
present
i
ventured
if
he
is
labouring
under
an
illusion
it
might
be
dangerous
to
cross
if
she
echoed
in
an
indescribable
tone
of
amazement
and
dread
can
you
for
a
moment
harbour
the
idea
that
he
has
spoken
the
truth
madam
i
returned
with
something
of
the
cynicism
of
my
calling
what
caused
you
to
give
such
an
unearthly
scream
just
before
this
murder
was
made
known
to
the
neighbourhood
she
stared
paled
and
finally
began
to
tremble
not
as
i
now
believe
at
the
insinuation
latent
in
my
words
but
at
the
doubts
which
my
question
aroused
in
her
own
breast
did
i
she
asked
then
with
a
burst
of
candour
which
seemed
inseparable
from
her
nature
she
continued
why
do
i
try
to
mislead
you
or
deceive
myself
i
did
give
a
shriek
just
before
the
alarm
was
raised
next
door
but
it
was
not
from
any
knowledge
i
had
of
a
crime
having
been
committed
but
because
i
unexpectedly
saw
before
me
my
husband
whom
i
supposed
to
be
on
his
way
to
poughkeepsie
he
was
looking
very
pale
and
strange
and
for
a
moment
i
thought
i
stood
face
to
face
with
his
ghost
but
he
soon
explained
his
appearance
by
saying
that
he
had
fallen
from
the
train
and
had
only
been
saved
by
a
miracle
from
being
dismembered
and
i
was
just
bemoaning
his
mishap
and
trying
to
calm
him
and
myself
when
that
terrible
shout
was
heard
next
door
of
murder
murder
coming
so
soon
after
the
shock
he
had
himself
experienced
it
quite
unnerved
him
and
i
think
we
can
date
his
mental
disturbance
from
that
moment
for
he
began
immediately
to
take
a
morbid
interest
in
the
affair
next
door
though
it
was
weeks
if
not
months
before
he
let
a
word
fall
of
the
nature
of
those
you
have
just
heard
indeed
it
was
not
till
i
repeated
to
him
some
of
the
expressions
he
was
continually
letting
fall
in
his
sleep
that
he
commenced
to
accuse
himself
of
crime
and
talk
of
you
say
that
your
husband
frightened
you
on
that
night
by
appearing
suddenly
at
the
door
when
you
thought
him
on
his
way
to
poughkeepsie
is
zabriskie
in
the
habit
of
thus
going
and
coming
alone
at
an
hour
so
late
as
this
must
have
been
you
forget
that
to
the
blind
night
is
less
full
of
perils
than
the
day
often
and
often
has
my
husband
found
his
way
to
his
patients
houses
alone
after
midnight
but
on
this
especial
evening
he
had
leonard
with
him
leonard
was
his
chauffeur
and
always
accompanied
him
when
he
went
any
well
then
said
i
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
summon
leonard
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
concerning
this
affair
he
will
surely
know
whether
or
not
his
master
went
into
the
house
next
leonard
has
left
us
she
said
dr
zabriskie
has
another
chauffeur
now
besides
i
have
nothing
to
conceal
from
you
leonard
was
not
with
him
when
he
returned
to
the
house
that
evening
or
the
doctor
would
not
have
been
without
his
portmanteau
till
the
next
day
something
i
have
never
known
what
caused
them
to
separate
and
that
is
why
i
have
no
answer
to
give
the
doctor
when
he
accuses
himself
of
committing
a
deed
that
night
so
wholly
out
of
keeping
with
every
other
act
of
his
and
have
you
never
asked
leonard
why
they
separated
and
why
he
allowed
his
master
to
come
home
alone
after
the
shock
he
had
received
at
the
station
i
did
not
know
there
was
any
reason
for
my
doing
so
till
long
after
he
had
left
and
when
did
he
leave
that
i
do
not
remember
a
few
weeks
or
possibly
a
few
days
after
that
dreadful
and
where
is
he
now
ah
that
i
have
not
the
least
means
of
knowing
but
she
objected
in
sudden
distrust
what
do
you
want
of
leonard
if
he
did
not
follow
zabriskie
to
his
own
door
he
could
tell
us
nothing
that
would
convince
my
husband
that
he
is
labouring
under
an
but
he
might
tell
us
something
which
would
convince
us
that
zabriskie
was
not
himself
after
the
accident
that
he
hush
came
from
her
lips
in
imperious
tones
i
will
not
believe
that
he
shot
hasbrouck
even
if
you
prove
him
to
have
been
insane
at
the
time
how
could
he
my
husband
is
blind
it
would
take
a
man
of
very
keen
sight
to
force
himself
into
a
house
closed
for
the
night
and
kill
a
man
in
the
dark
at
one
on
the
contrary
it
is
only
a
blind
man
who
could
do
this
cried
a
voice
from
the
doorway
those
who
trust
to
eyesight
must
be
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
mark
they
aim
at
and
this
room
as
i
have
been
told
was
without
a
glimmer
of
light
but
the
blind
trust
to
sound
and
as
hasbrouck
spoke
oh
burst
from
the
horrified
wife
is
there
no
one
to
stop
him
when
he
speaks
like
that
iii
as
you
will
see
this
matter
so
recklessly
entered
into
had
proved
to
be
of
too
serious
a
nature
for
me
to
pursue
it
farther
without
the
cognizance
of
the
police
having
a
friend
on
the
force
in
whose
discretion
i
could
rely
i
took
him
into
my
confidence
and
asked
for
his
advice
he
the
doctor
s
statements
but
said
that
he
would
bring
the
matter
to
the
attention
of
the
superintendent
and
let
me
know
the
result
i
agreed
to
this
and
we
parted
with
the
mutual
understanding
that
mum
was
the
word
till
some
official
decision
had
been
arrived
at
i
had
not
long
to
wait
at
an
early
day
he
came
in
with
the
information
that
there
had
been
as
might
be
expected
a
division
of
opinion
among
his
superiors
as
to
the
importance
of
zabriskie
s
confession
but
in
one
point
they
had
been
unanimous
and
that
was
the
desirability
of
his
appearing
before
them
at
headquarters
for
a
personal
examination
as
however
in
the
mind
of
two
out
of
three
of
them
his
condition
was
attributed
entirely
to
acute
mania
it
had
been
thought
best
to
employ
as
their
emissary
one
in
whom
he
had
already
confided
and
submitted
his
case
to
in
other
words
myself
the
time
was
set
for
the
next
afternoon
at
the
close
of
his
usual
office
hours
he
went
without
reluctance
his
wife
accompanying
him
in
the
short
time
which
elapsed
between
their
leaving
home
and
entering
headquarters
i
embraced
the
opportunity
of
observing
them
and
i
found
the
study
equally
exciting
and
interesting
his
face
was
calm
but
hopeless
and
his
eye
dark
and
unfathomable
but
neither
frenzied
nor
uncertain
he
spoke
but
once
and
listened
to
nothing
though
now
and
then
his
wife
moved
as
if
to
attract
his
attention
and
once
even
stole
her
hand
towards
his
in
the
tender
hope
that
he
would
feel
its
approach
and
accept
her
sympathy
but
he
was
deaf
as
well
as
blind
and
sat
wrapped
up
in
thoughts
which
she
i
know
would
have
given
worlds
to
penetrate
her
countenance
was
not
without
its
mystery
also
she
showed
in
every
lineament
passionate
concern
and
misery
and
a
deep
tenderness
from
which
the
element
of
fear
was
not
absent
but
she
as
well
as
he
betrayed
that
some
misunderstanding
deeper
than
any
i
had
previously
suspected
drew
its
intangible
veil
between
them
and
made
the
near
proximity
in
which
they
sat
at
once
a
delight
and
an
unspeakable
pain
what
was
the
misunderstanding
and
what
was
the
character
of
the
fear
that
modified
her
every
look
of
love
in
his
direction
her
perfect
indifference
to
my
presence
proved
that
it
was
not
connected
with
the
position
in
which
he
had
placed
himself
towards
the
police
by
his
voluntary
confession
of
crime
nor
could
i
thus
interpret
the
expression
of
frantic
question
which
now
and
then
contracted
her
features
as
she
raised
her
eyes
towards
his
sightless
orbs
and
strove
to
read
in
his
firm
set
lips
the
meaning
of
those
assertions
she
could
only
ascribe
to
loss
of
reason
the
stopping
of
the
carriage
seemed
to
awaken
both
from
thoughts
that
separated
rather
than
united
them
he
turned
his
face
in
her
direction
and
she
stretching
forth
her
hand
prepared
to
lead
him
from
the
carriage
without
any
of
that
display
of
timidity
which
had
previously
been
evident
in
her
manner
as
his
guide
she
seemed
to
fear
nothing
as
his
lover
everything
there
is
another
and
a
deeper
tragedy
underlying
the
outward
and
obvious
one
was
my
inward
conclusion
as
i
followed
them
into
the
presence
of
the
gentlemen
awaiting
them
zabriskie
s
quiet
appearance
was
in
itself
a
shock
to
those
who
had
anticipated
the
feverish
unrest
of
a
madman
so
was
his
speech
which
was
calm
straightforward
and
quietly
determined
i
shot
hasbrouck
was
his
steady
affirmation
given
without
any
show
of
frenzy
or
desperation
if
you
ask
me
why
i
did
it
i
can
not
answer
if
you
ask
me
how
i
am
ready
to
state
all
that
i
know
concerning
the
but
zabriskie
interposed
one
of
the
inspectors
the
why
is
the
most
important
thing
for
us
to
consider
just
now
if
you
really
desire
to
convince
us
that
you
committed
this
dreadful
crime
of
killing
a
totally
inoffensive
man
you
should
give
us
some
reason
for
an
act
so
opposed
to
all
your
instincts
and
general
but
the
doctor
continued
unmoved
i
had
no
reason
for
murdering
hasbrouck
a
hundred
questions
can
elicit
no
other
reply
you
had
better
keep
to
the
a
breath
from
the
wife
answered
the
looks
of
the
three
gentlemen
to
whom
this
suggestion
was
offered
you
see
that
breath
seemed
to
protest
that
he
is
not
in
his
right
i
began
to
waver
in
my
own
opinion
and
yet
the
intuition
which
has
served
me
in
cases
seemingly
as
impenetrable
as
this
bade
me
beware
of
following
the
general
judgment
ask
him
to
inform
you
how
he
got
into
the
house
i
whispered
to
inspector
d
who
sat
nearest
me
immediately
the
inspector
put
the
question
which
i
had
suggested
by
what
means
did
you
enter
hasbrouck
s
house
at
so
late
an
hour
as
this
murder
occurred
the
blind
doctor
s
head
fell
forward
on
his
breast
and
he
hesitated
for
the
first
and
only
time
you
will
not
believe
me
said
he
but
the
door
was
ajar
when
i
came
to
it
such
things
make
crime
easy
it
is
the
only
excuse
i
have
to
offer
for
this
dreadful
the
front
door
of
a
respectable
citizen
s
house
ajar
at
eleven
at
night
it
was
a
statement
that
fixed
in
all
minds
the
conviction
of
the
speaker
s
irresponsibility
zabriskie
s
brow
cleared
and
her
beauty
became
for
a
moment
dazzling
as
she
held
out
her
hands
in
irrepressible
relief
towards
those
who
were
interrogating
her
husband
i
alone
kept
my
impassibility
a
possible
explanation
of
this
crime
had
flashed
like
lightning
across
my
mind
an
explanation
from
which
i
inwardly
recoiled
even
while
i
felt
forced
to
consider
it
dr
zabriskie
remarked
the
inspector
formerly
mentioned
as
friendly
to
him
such
old
servants
as
those
kept
by
hasbrouck
do
not
leave
the
front
door
ajar
at
twelve
o
clock
at
yet
ajar
it
was
repeated
the
blind
doctor
with
quiet
emphasis
and
finding
it
so
i
went
in
when
i
came
out
again
i
closed
it
do
you
wish
me
to
swear
to
what
i
say
if
so
i
am
what
reply
could
they
give
to
see
this
man
hallowed
by
an
affliction
so
great
that
in
itself
it
called
forth
the
compassion
of
the
most
indifferent
accusing
himself
of
a
crime
in
tones
which
sounded
dispassionate
because
of
the
will
forcing
their
utterance
was
too
painful
in
itself
for
any
one
to
indulge
in
unnecessary
words
compassion
took
the
place
of
curiosity
and
each
and
all
of
us
turned
involuntary
looks
of
pity
upon
the
young
wife
pressing
so
eagerly
to
his
side
for
a
blind
man
ventured
one
the
assault
was
both
deft
and
certain
are
you
accustomed
to
hasbrouck
s
house
that
you
found
your
way
with
so
little
difficulty
to
his
bedroom
i
am
accustomed
he
began
but
here
his
wife
broke
in
with
irrepressible
passion
he
is
not
accustomed
to
that
house
he
has
never
been
beyond
the
first
floor
why
why
do
you
question
him
do
you
not
see
his
hand
was
on
her
lips
hush
he
commanded
you
know
my
skill
in
moving
about
a
house
how
i
sometimes
deceive
those
who
do
not
know
me
into
believing
that
i
can
see
by
the
readiness
with
which
i
avoid
obstacles
and
find
my
way
even
in
strange
and
untried
scenes
do
not
try
to
make
them
think
i
am
not
in
my
right
mind
or
you
will
drive
me
into
the
very
condition
you
attribute
to
his
face
rigid
cold
and
set
looked
like
that
of
a
mask
hers
drawn
with
horror
and
filled
with
question
that
was
fast
taking
the
form
of
doubt
bespoke
an
awful
tragedy
from
which
more
than
one
of
us
recoiled
can
you
shoot
a
man
dead
without
seeing
him
asked
the
superintendent
with
painful
effort
give
me
a
pistol
and
i
will
show
you
was
the
quick
reply
a
low
cry
came
from
the
wife
in
a
drawer
near
to
every
one
of
us
there
lay
a
pistol
but
no
one
moved
to
take
it
out
there
was
a
look
in
the
doctor
s
eye
which
made
us
fear
to
trust
him
with
a
pistol
just
then
we
will
accept
your
assurance
that
you
possess
a
skill
beyond
that
of
most
men
returned
the
superintendent
and
beckoning
me
forward
he
whispered
this
is
a
case
for
the
doctors
and
not
for
the
police
remove
him
quietly
and
notify
southyard
of
what
i
but
zabriskie
who
seemed
to
have
an
almost
supernatural
acuteness
of
hearing
gave
a
violent
start
at
this
and
spoke
up
for
the
first
time
with
real
passion
in
his
voice
no
no
i
pray
you
i
can
bear
anything
but
that
remember
gentlemen
that
i
am
blind
that
i
can
not
see
who
is
about
me
that
my
life
would
be
a
torture
if
i
felt
myself
surrounded
by
spies
watching
to
catch
some
evidence
of
madness
in
me
rather
conviction
at
once
death
dishonour
and
obloquy
these
i
have
incurred
these
i
have
brought
upon
myself
by
crime
but
not
this
worse
fate
oh
not
this
worse
his
passion
was
so
intense
and
yet
so
confined
within
the
bounds
of
decorum
that
we
felt
strangely
impressed
by
it
only
the
wife
stood
transfixed
with
the
dread
growing
in
her
heart
till
her
white
waxen
visage
seemed
even
more
terrible
to
contemplate
than
his
one
it
is
not
strange
that
my
wife
thinks
me
demented
the
doctor
continued
as
if
afraid
of
the
silence
that
answered
him
but
it
is
your
business
to
discriminate
and
you
should
know
a
sane
man
when
you
see
inspector
d
no
longer
hesitated
very
well
said
he
give
me
the
least
proof
that
your
assertions
are
true
and
we
will
lay
your
case
before
the
prosecuting
proof
is
not
a
man
s
word
no
man
s
confession
is
worth
much
without
some
evidence
to
support
it
in
your
case
there
is
none
you
can
not
even
produce
the
pistol
with
which
you
assert
yourself
to
have
committed
the
true
true
i
was
frightened
by
what
i
had
done
and
the
instinct
of
led
me
to
rid
myself
of
the
weapon
in
any
way
i
could
but
someone
found
this
pistol
someone
picked
it
up
from
the
sidewalk
of
lafayette
place
on
that
fatal
night
advertise
for
it
offer
a
reward
i
will
give
you
the
suddenly
he
appeared
to
realize
how
all
this
sounded
alas
cried
he
i
know
the
story
seems
improbable
but
it
is
not
the
probable
things
that
happen
in
this
life
as
you
should
know
who
every
day
dig
deep
into
the
heart
of
human
were
these
the
ravings
of
insanity
i
began
to
understand
the
wife
s
terror
i
bought
the
pistol
he
went
on
of
alas
i
can
not
tell
you
his
name
everything
is
against
me
i
can
not
adduce
one
proof
yet
even
she
is
beginning
to
fear
that
my
story
is
true
i
know
it
by
her
silence
a
silence
that
yawns
between
us
like
a
deep
and
unfathomable
but
at
these
words
her
voice
rang
out
with
passionate
vehemence
no
no
it
is
false
i
will
never
believe
that
your
hands
have
been
plunged
in
blood
you
are
my
own
constant
cold
perhaps
and
stern
but
with
no
guilt
upon
your
conscience
save
in
your
own
wild
zulma
you
are
no
friend
to
me
he
declared
pushing
her
gently
aside
believe
me
innocent
but
say
nothing
to
lead
these
others
to
doubt
my
and
she
said
no
more
but
her
looks
spoke
volumes
the
result
was
that
he
was
not
detained
though
he
prayed
for
instant
commitment
he
seemed
to
dread
his
own
home
and
the
surveillance
to
which
he
instinctively
knew
he
would
henceforth
be
subjected
to
see
him
shrink
from
his
wife
s
hand
as
she
strove
to
lead
him
from
the
room
was
sufficiently
painful
but
the
feeling
thus
aroused
was
nothing
to
that
with
which
we
observed
the
keen
and
agonized
expectancy
of
his
look
as
he
turned
and
listened
for
the
steps
of
the
officer
who
followed
him
from
this
time
on
i
shall
never
know
whether
or
not
i
am
alone
was
his
final
observation
as
he
left
the
building
here
is
where
the
matter
rests
and
here
miss
strange
is
where
you
come
in
the
police
were
for
sending
an
expert
alienist
into
the
house
but
agreeing
with
me
and
in
fact
with
the
doctor
himself
that
if
he
were
not
already
out
of
his
mind
this
would
certainly
make
them
so
they
at
my
earnest
intercession
have
left
the
next
move
to
me
that
move
as
you
must
by
this
time
understand
involves
you
you
have
advantages
for
making
zabriskie
s
acquaintance
of
which
i
beg
you
to
avail
yourself
as
friend
or
patient
you
must
win
your
way
into
that
home
you
must
sound
to
its
depths
one
or
both
of
these
two
wretched
hearts
not
so
much
now
for
any
possible
reward
which
may
follow
the
elucidation
of
this
mystery
which
has
come
so
near
being
shelved
but
for
pity
s
sake
and
the
possible
settlement
of
a
question
which
is
fast
driving
a
lovely
member
of
your
sex
distracted
may
i
rely
on
you
if
so
various
instructions
followed
over
which
violet
mused
with
a
deprecatory
shaking
of
her
head
till
the
little
clock
struck
two
why
should
she
already
in
a
state
of
secret
despondency
intrude
herself
into
an
affair
at
once
so
painful
and
so
hopeless
iv
but
by
morning
her
mood
changed
the
pathos
of
the
situation
had
seized
upon
her
in
her
dreams
and
before
the
day
was
over
she
was
to
be
seen
as
a
prospective
patient
in
zabriskie
s
office
she
had
a
slight
complaint
as
her
excuse
and
she
made
the
most
of
it
that
is
at
first
but
as
the
personality
of
this
extraordinary
man
began
to
make
its
usual
impression
she
found
herself
forgetting
her
own
condition
in
the
intensity
of
interest
she
felt
in
his
indeed
she
had
to
pull
herself
together
more
than
once
lest
he
should
suspect
the
double
nature
of
her
errand
and
she
actually
caught
herself
at
times
rejoicing
in
his
affliction
since
it
left
her
with
only
her
voice
to
think
of
in
her
hated
but
necessary
task
of
deception
that
she
succeeded
in
this
effort
even
with
one
of
his
nice
ear
was
evident
from
the
interested
way
in
which
he
dilated
upon
her
malady
and
the
minute
instructions
he
was
careful
to
give
her
the
physician
being
always
uppermost
in
his
strange
dual
nature
when
he
was
in
his
office
or
at
the
bedside
of
the
sick
and
had
she
not
been
a
deep
reader
of
the
human
soul
she
would
have
left
his
presence
in
simple
wonder
at
his
skill
and
entire
absorption
in
an
exacting
profession
but
as
it
was
she
carried
with
her
an
image
of
subdued
suffering
which
drove
her
from
that
moment
on
to
ask
herself
what
she
could
do
to
aid
him
in
his
fight
against
his
own
illusion
for
to
associate
such
a
man
with
a
senseless
and
cruel
murder
was
preposterous
what
this
wish
helped
by
no
common
determination
led
her
into
it
was
not
in
her
mind
to
conceive
she
was
making
her
one
great
mistake
but
as
yet
she
was
in
happy
ignorance
of
it
and
pursued
the
course
laid
out
for
her
without
a
doubt
of
the
ultimate
result
having
seen
and
made
up
her
mind
about
the
husband
she
next
sought
to
see
and
gauge
the
wife
that
she
succeeded
in
doing
this
by
means
of
one
of
her
sly
little
tricks
is
not
to
the
point
but
what
followed
in
natural
consequence
is
very
much
so
a
mutual
interest
sprang
up
between
them
which
led
very
speedily
to
actual
friendship
zabriskie
s
hungry
heart
opened
to
the
sympathetic
little
being
who
clung
to
her
in
such
evident
admiration
while
violet
brought
face
to
face
with
a
real
woman
succumbed
to
feelings
which
made
it
no
imposition
on
her
part
to
spend
much
of
her
leisure
in
zulma
zabriskie
s
company
the
result
were
the
following
naive
reports
which
drifted
into
her
employer
s
office
from
day
to
day
as
this
intimacy
deepened
the
doctor
is
settling
into
a
deep
melancholy
from
which
he
tries
to
rise
at
times
but
with
only
indifferent
success
yesterday
he
rode
around
to
all
his
patients
for
the
purpose
of
withdrawing
his
services
on
the
plea
of
illness
but
he
still
keeps
his
office
open
and
today
i
had
the
opportunity
of
witnessing
his
reception
and
treatment
of
the
many
sufferers
who
came
to
him
for
aid
i
think
he
was
conscious
of
my
presence
though
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
conceal
it
for
the
listening
look
never
left
his
face
from
the
moment
he
entered
the
room
and
once
he
rose
and
passed
quickly
from
wall
to
wall
groping
with
hands
into
every
nook
and
corner
and
barely
escaping
contact
with
the
curtain
behind
which
i
was
hidden
but
if
he
suspected
my
presence
he
showed
no
displeasure
at
it
wishing
perhaps
for
a
witness
to
his
skill
in
the
treatment
of
disease
and
truly
i
never
beheld
a
finer
manifestation
of
practical
insight
in
cases
of
a
more
or
less
baffling
nature
he
is
certainly
a
most
wonderful
physician
and
i
feel
bound
to
record
that
his
mind
is
as
clear
for
business
as
if
no
shadow
had
fallen
upon
it
zabriskie
loves
his
wife
but
in
a
way
torturing
to
himself
and
to
her
if
she
is
gone
from
the
house
he
is
wretched
and
yet
when
she
returns
he
often
forbears
to
speak
to
her
or
if
he
does
speak
it
is
with
a
constraint
that
hurts
her
more
than
his
silence
i
was
present
when
she
came
in
today
her
step
which
had
been
eager
on
the
stairway
flagged
as
she
approached
the
room
and
he
naturally
noted
the
change
and
gave
his
own
interpretation
to
it
his
face
which
had
been
very
pale
flushed
suddenly
and
a
nervous
trembling
seized
him
which
he
sought
in
vain
to
hide
but
by
the
time
her
tall
and
beautiful
figure
stood
in
the
doorway
he
was
his
usual
self
again
in
all
but
the
expression
of
his
eyes
which
stared
straight
before
him
in
an
agony
of
longing
only
to
be
observed
in
those
who
have
once
seen
where
have
you
been
zulma
he
asked
as
contrary
to
his
wont
he
moved
to
meet
her
to
my
mother
s
to
arnold
constable
s
and
to
the
hospital
as
you
requested
was
her
quick
answer
made
without
faltering
or
embarrassment
he
stepped
still
nearer
and
took
her
hand
and
as
he
did
so
my
eye
fell
on
his
and
i
noted
that
his
finger
lay
over
her
pulse
in
seeming
unconsciousness
nowhere
else
he
queried
she
smiled
the
saddest
kind
of
smile
and
shook
her
head
then
remembering
that
he
could
not
see
this
movement
she
cried
in
a
wistful
tone
nowhere
else
constant
i
was
too
anxious
to
get
i
expected
him
to
drop
her
hand
at
this
but
he
did
not
and
his
finger
still
rested
on
her
pulse
and
whom
did
you
see
while
you
were
gone
he
continued
she
told
him
naming
over
several
names
you
must
have
enjoyed
yourself
was
his
cold
comment
as
he
let
go
her
hand
and
turned
away
but
his
manner
showed
relief
and
i
could
not
but
sympathize
with
the
pitiable
situation
of
a
man
who
found
himself
forced
into
means
like
this
for
probing
the
heart
of
his
young
wife
yet
when
i
turned
towards
her
i
realized
that
her
position
was
but
little
happier
than
his
tears
are
no
strangers
to
her
eyes
but
those
which
welled
up
at
this
moment
seemed
to
possess
a
bitterness
that
promised
but
little
peace
for
her
future
yet
she
quickly
dried
them
and
busied
herself
with
ministrations
for
his
comfort
if
i
am
any
judge
of
woman
zulma
zabriskie
is
superior
to
most
of
her
sex
that
her
husband
mistrusts
her
is
evident
but
whether
this
is
the
result
of
the
stand
she
has
taken
in
his
regard
or
only
a
manifestation
of
dementia
i
have
as
yet
been
unable
to
determine
i
dread
to
leave
them
alone
together
and
yet
when
i
presume
to
suggest
that
she
should
be
on
her
guard
in
her
interviews
with
him
she
smiles
very
placidly
and
tells
me
that
nothing
would
give
her
greater
joy
than
to
see
him
lift
his
hand
against
her
for
that
would
argue
that
he
is
not
accountable
for
his
deeds
or
assertions
yet
it
would
be
a
grief
to
see
her
injured
by
this
passionate
and
unhappy
man
you
have
said
that
you
wanted
all
the
details
i
could
give
so
i
feel
bound
to
say
that
zabriskie
tries
to
be
considerate
of
his
wife
though
he
often
fails
in
the
attempt
when
she
offers
herself
as
his
guide
or
assists
him
with
his
mail
or
performs
any
of
the
many
acts
of
kindness
by
which
she
continually
manifests
her
sense
of
his
affliction
he
thanks
her
with
courtesy
and
often
with
kindness
yet
i
know
she
would
willingly
exchange
all
his
set
phrases
for
one
fond
embrace
or
impulsive
smile
of
affection
it
would
be
too
much
to
say
that
he
is
not
in
the
full
possession
of
his
faculties
and
yet
upon
what
other
hypothesis
can
we
account
for
the
inconsistencies
of
his
conduct
i
have
before
me
two
visions
of
mental
suffering
at
noon
i
passed
the
office
door
and
looking
within
saw
the
figure
of
zabriskie
seated
in
his
great
chair
lost
in
thought
or
deep
in
those
memories
which
make
an
abyss
in
one
s
consciousness
his
hands
which
were
clenched
rested
upon
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
in
one
of
them
i
detected
a
woman
s
glove
which
i
had
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
one
of
the
pair
worn
by
his
wife
this
morning
he
held
it
as
a
tiger
might
hold
his
prey
or
a
miser
his
gold
but
his
set
features
and
sightless
eyes
betrayed
that
a
conflict
of
emotions
was
being
waged
within
him
among
which
tenderness
had
but
little
share
though
alive
as
he
usually
is
to
every
sound
he
was
too
absorbed
at
this
moment
to
notice
my
presence
though
i
had
taken
no
pains
to
approach
quietly
i
therefore
stood
for
a
full
minute
watching
him
till
an
irresistible
sense
of
the
shame
at
thus
spying
upon
a
blind
man
in
his
moments
of
secret
anguish
compelled
me
to
withdraw
but
not
before
i
saw
his
features
relax
in
a
storm
of
passionate
feeling
as
he
rained
kisses
after
kisses
on
the
senseless
kid
he
had
so
long
held
in
his
motionless
grasp
yet
when
an
hour
later
he
entered
the
on
his
wife
s
arm
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
to
show
that
he
had
in
any
way
changed
in
his
attitude
towards
her
the
other
picture
was
more
tragic
still
i
was
seeking
zabriskie
in
her
own
room
when
i
caught
a
fleeting
vision
of
her
tall
form
with
her
arms
thrown
up
over
her
head
in
a
paroxysm
of
feeling
which
made
her
as
oblivious
to
my
presence
as
her
husband
had
been
several
hours
before
were
the
words
that
escaped
her
lips
thank
god
we
have
no
children
or
was
this
exclamation
suggested
to
me
by
the
passion
and
unrestrained
impulse
of
her
action
so
much
up
to
date
interesting
enough
or
so
her
employer
seemed
to
think
as
he
went
hurriedly
through
the
whole
story
one
special
afternoon
in
his
office
tapping
each
sheet
as
he
laid
it
aside
with
his
sagacious
forefinger
as
though
he
would
say
enough
my
theory
still
holds
good
nothing
contradictory
here
on
the
contrary
complete
and
undisputable
confirmation
of
the
one
and
only
explanation
of
this
astounding
what
was
that
theory
and
in
what
way
and
through
whose
efforts
had
he
been
enabled
to
form
one
the
following
notes
may
enlighten
us
though
written
in
his
own
hand
and
undoubtedly
a
memorandum
of
his
own
activities
he
evidently
thinks
it
worth
while
to
reperuse
them
in
connection
with
those
he
had
just
laid
aside
we
can
do
no
better
than
read
them
also
we
omit
dates
watched
the
zabriskie
mansion
for
five
hours
this
morning
from
the
second
story
window
of
an
adjoining
hotel
saw
the
doctor
when
he
drove
away
on
his
round
of
visits
and
saw
him
when
he
returned
a
coloured
man
accompanied
him
today
i
followed
zabriskie
she
went
first
to
a
house
in
washington
place
where
i
am
told
her
mother
lives
here
she
stayed
some
time
after
which
she
drove
down
to
canal
street
where
she
did
some
shopping
and
later
stopped
at
the
hospital
into
which
i
took
the
liberty
of
following
her
she
seemed
to
know
many
there
and
passed
from
cot
to
cot
with
a
smile
in
which
i
alone
discerned
the
sadness
of
a
broken
heart
when
she
left
i
left
also
without
having
learned
anything
beyond
the
fact
that
zabriskie
is
one
who
does
her
duty
in
sorrow
as
in
joy
a
rare
and
trustworthy
woman
i
should
say
and
yet
her
husband
does
not
trust
her
why
i
have
spent
this
day
in
accumulating
details
in
regard
to
and
zabriskie
s
life
previous
to
the
death
of
hasbrouck
i
learned
from
sources
it
would
be
unwise
to
quote
just
here
that
zabriskie
had
not
lacked
enemies
to
charge
her
with
coquetry
that
while
she
had
never
sacrificed
her
dignity
in
public
more
than
one
person
had
been
heard
to
declare
that
zabriskie
was
fortunate
in
being
blind
since
the
sight
of
his
wife
s
beauty
would
have
but
poorly
compensated
him
for
the
pain
he
would
have
suffered
in
seeing
how
that
beauty
was
admired
that
all
gossip
is
more
or
less
tinged
with
exaggeration
i
have
no
doubt
yet
when
a
name
is
mentioned
in
connection
with
such
stories
there
is
usually
some
truth
at
the
bottom
of
them
and
a
name
is
mentioned
in
this
case
though
i
do
not
think
it
worth
my
while
to
repeat
it
here
and
loth
as
i
am
to
recognize
the
fact
it
is
a
name
that
carries
with
it
doubts
that
might
easily
account
for
the
husband
s
jealousy
true
i
have
found
no
one
who
dares
hint
that
she
still
continues
to
attract
attention
or
to
bestow
smiles
in
any
direction
save
where
they
legally
belong
for
since
a
certain
memorable
night
which
we
all
know
neither
zabriskie
nor
his
wife
have
been
seen
save
in
their
own
domestic
circle
and
it
is
not
into
such
scenes
that
this
serpent
to
whom
i
have
just
alluded
ever
intrudes
nor
is
it
in
places
of
sorrow
or
suffering
that
his
smile
shines
or
his
fascinations
flourish
and
so
one
portion
of
my
theory
is
proved
to
be
sound
zabriskie
is
jealous
of
his
wife
whether
with
good
cause
or
bad
i
am
not
prepared
to
decide
since
her
present
attitude
clouded
as
it
is
by
the
tragedy
in
which
she
and
her
husband
are
both
involved
must
differ
very
much
from
that
which
she
held
when
her
life
was
unshadowed
by
doubt
and
her
admirers
could
be
counted
by
the
score
i
have
just
found
out
where
leonard
is
as
he
is
in
service
some
miles
up
the
river
i
shall
have
to
be
absent
from
my
post
for
several
hours
but
i
consider
the
game
well
worth
the
candle
light
at
last
i
have
not
only
seen
leonard
but
succeeded
in
making
him
talk
his
story
is
substantially
this
that
on
the
night
so
often
mentioned
he
packed
his
master
s
portmanteau
at
eight
o
clock
and
at
ten
called
a
taxi
and
rode
with
the
doctor
to
the
central
station
he
was
told
to
buy
tickets
to
poughkeepsie
where
his
master
had
been
called
in
consultation
and
having
done
this
hurried
back
to
join
zabriskie
on
the
platform
they
had
walked
together
as
far
as
the
cars
and
zabriskie
was
just
stepping
on
to
the
train
when
a
man
pushed
himself
hurriedly
between
them
and
whispered
something
into
his
master
s
ear
which
caused
him
to
fall
back
and
lose
his
footing
zabriskie
s
body
slid
half
under
the
car
but
he
was
withdrawn
before
any
harm
was
done
though
the
cars
gave
a
lurch
at
that
moment
which
must
have
frightened
him
exceedingly
for
his
face
was
white
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
when
leonard
offered
to
assist
him
again
on
the
train
he
refused
to
go
and
said
he
would
return
home
and
not
attempt
to
ride
to
poughkeepsie
that
night
the
gentleman
whom
leonard
now
saw
to
be
stanton
an
intimate
friend
of
zabriskie
smiled
very
queerly
at
this
and
taking
the
doctor
s
arm
led
him
back
to
his
own
auto
leonard
naturally
followed
them
but
the
doctor
hearing
his
steps
turned
and
bade
him
in
a
very
peremptory
tone
to
take
the
cars
home
and
then
as
if
on
second
thought
told
him
to
go
to
poughkeepsie
in
his
stead
and
explain
to
the
people
there
that
he
was
too
shaken
up
by
his
misstep
to
do
his
duty
and
that
he
would
be
with
them
next
morning
this
seemed
strange
to
leonard
but
he
had
no
reasons
for
disobeying
his
master
s
orders
and
so
rode
to
poughkeepsie
but
the
doctor
did
not
follow
him
the
next
day
on
the
contrary
he
telegraphed
for
him
to
return
and
when
he
got
back
dismissed
him
with
a
month
s
wages
this
ended
leonard
s
connection
with
the
zabriskie
family
a
simple
story
bearing
out
what
the
wife
has
already
told
us
but
it
furnishes
a
link
which
may
prove
invaluable
stanton
whose
first
name
is
theodore
knows
the
real
reason
why
zabriskie
returned
home
on
the
night
of
the
seventeenth
of
july
stanton
consequently
is
the
man
to
see
and
this
shall
be
my
business
tomorrow
checkmate
theodore
stanton
is
not
in
this
country
though
this
points
him
out
as
the
man
from
whom
zabriskie
bought
the
pistol
it
does
not
facilitate
my
work
which
is
becoming
more
and
more
difficult
stanton
s
whereabouts
are
not
even
known
to
his
most
intimate
friends
he
sailed
from
this
country
most
unexpectedly
on
the
eighteenth
of
july
a
year
ago
which
was
the
day
after
the
murder
of
hasbrouck
it
looks
like
a
flight
especially
as
he
has
failed
to
maintain
open
communication
even
with
his
relatives
was
he
the
man
who
shot
hasbrouck
no
but
he
was
the
man
who
put
the
pistol
in
zabriskie
s
hand
that
night
and
whether
he
did
this
with
purpose
or
not
was
evidently
so
alarmed
at
the
catastrophe
which
followed
that
he
took
the
first
outgoing
steamer
to
europe
so
far
all
is
clear
but
there
are
mysteries
yet
to
be
solved
which
will
require
my
utmost
tact
what
if
i
should
seek
out
the
gentleman
with
whose
name
that
of
zabriskie
has
been
linked
and
see
if
i
can
in
any
way
connect
him
with
stanton
or
the
events
of
that
night
eureka
i
have
discovered
that
stanton
cherished
a
mortal
hatred
for
the
gentleman
above
mentioned
it
was
a
covert
feeling
but
no
less
deadly
on
that
account
and
while
it
never
led
him
into
any
extravagances
it
was
of
force
sufficient
to
account
for
many
a
secret
misfortune
occurring
to
that
gentleman
now
if
i
can
prove
that
he
is
the
mephistopheles
who
whispered
insinuations
into
the
ear
of
our
blind
faust
i
may
strike
a
fact
that
will
lead
me
out
of
this
maze
but
how
can
i
approach
secrets
so
delicate
without
compromising
the
woman
i
feel
bound
to
respect
if
only
for
the
devoted
love
she
manifests
for
her
unhappy
husband
i
shall
have
to
appeal
to
joe
smithers
this
is
something
which
i
always
hate
to
do
but
as
long
as
he
will
take
money
and
as
long
as
he
is
fertile
in
resources
for
obtaining
the
truth
from
people
i
am
myself
unable
to
reach
i
must
make
use
of
his
cupidity
and
his
genius
he
is
an
honourable
fellow
in
one
way
and
never
retails
as
gossip
what
he
acquires
for
our
use
how
will
he
proceed
in
this
case
and
by
what
tactics
will
he
gain
the
very
delicate
information
which
we
need
i
own
that
i
am
curious
to
see
i
shall
really
have
to
put
down
at
length
the
incidents
of
this
night
i
always
knew
that
joe
smithers
was
invaluable
not
only
to
myself
but
to
the
police
but
i
really
did
not
know
he
possessed
talents
of
so
high
an
order
he
wrote
me
this
morning
that
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
t
s
promise
to
spend
the
evening
with
him
and
advised
me
that
if
i
desired
to
be
present
as
well
his
own
servant
would
not
be
at
home
and
that
an
opener
of
bottles
would
be
required
as
i
was
very
anxious
to
see
t
with
my
own
eyes
i
accepted
this
invitation
to
play
the
spy
and
went
at
the
proper
hour
to
smithers
s
rooms
i
found
them
picturesque
in
the
extreme
piles
of
books
stacked
here
and
there
to
the
ceiling
made
nooks
and
corners
which
could
be
quite
shut
off
by
a
couple
of
old
pictures
set
into
movable
frames
capable
of
swinging
out
or
in
at
the
whim
or
convenience
of
the
owner
as
i
had
use
for
the
dark
shadows
cast
by
these
pictures
i
pulled
them
both
out
and
made
such
other
arrangements
as
appeared
likely
to
facilitate
the
purpose
i
had
in
view
then
i
sat
down
and
waited
for
the
two
gentlemen
who
were
expected
to
come
in
together
they
arrived
almost
immediately
whereupon
i
rose
and
played
my
part
with
all
necessary
discretion
while
ridding
t
of
his
overcoat
i
stole
a
look
at
his
face
it
is
not
a
handsome
one
but
it
boasts
of
a
gay
expression
which
doubtless
makes
it
dangerous
to
many
women
while
his
manners
are
especially
attractive
and
his
voice
the
richest
and
most
persuasive
that
i
ever
heard
i
contrasted
him
almost
against
my
will
with
zabriskie
and
decided
that
with
most
women
the
former
s
undoubted
fascinations
of
speech
and
bearing
would
outweigh
the
latter
s
great
beauty
and
mental
endowments
but
i
doubted
if
they
would
with
her
the
conversation
which
immediately
began
was
brilliant
but
desultory
for
smithers
with
an
airy
lightness
for
which
he
is
remarkable
introduced
topic
after
topic
perhaps
for
the
purpose
of
showing
off
s
versatility
and
perhaps
for
the
deeper
and
more
sinister
purpose
of
shaking
the
kaleidoscope
of
talk
so
thoroughly
that
the
real
topic
which
we
were
met
to
discuss
should
not
make
an
undue
impression
on
the
mind
of
his
guest
meanwhile
one
two
three
bottles
passed
and
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
joe
smithers
s
eye
grow
calmer
and
that
of
t
more
brilliant
and
more
uncertain
as
the
last
bottle
was
being
passed
joe
cast
me
a
meaning
glance
and
the
real
business
of
the
evening
began
i
shall
not
attempt
to
relate
the
half
dozen
failures
which
joe
made
in
endeavouring
to
elicit
the
facts
we
were
in
search
of
without
arousing
the
suspicion
of
his
visitor
i
am
only
going
to
relate
the
successful
attempt
they
had
been
talking
now
for
some
hours
and
i
who
had
long
before
been
waved
aside
from
their
immediate
presence
was
hiding
my
curiosity
and
growing
excitement
behind
one
of
the
pictures
when
i
suddenly
heard
joe
say
he
has
the
most
remarkable
memory
i
ever
met
he
can
tell
to
a
day
when
any
notable
event
pshaw
answered
his
companion
who
by
the
way
was
known
to
pride
himself
upon
his
own
memory
for
dates
i
can
state
where
i
went
and
what
i
did
on
every
day
in
the
year
that
may
not
embrace
what
you
call
notable
events
but
the
memory
required
is
all
the
more
remarkable
is
it
not
pooh
was
his
friend
s
provoking
reply
you
are
bluffing
ben
i
will
never
believe
who
had
passed
by
this
time
into
that
stage
of
intoxication
which
makes
persistence
in
an
assertion
a
duty
as
well
as
a
pleasure
threw
back
his
head
and
as
the
wreaths
of
smoke
rose
in
airy
spirals
from
his
lips
reiterated
his
statement
and
offered
to
submit
to
any
test
of
his
vaunted
powers
which
the
other
might
dictate
you
keep
a
diary
began
joe
which
at
the
present
moment
is
at
home
completed
the
other
will
you
allow
me
to
refer
to
it
tomorrow
if
i
am
suspicious
of
the
accuracy
of
your
recollections
undoubtedly
returned
the
other
very
well
then
i
will
wager
you
a
cool
fifty
that
you
can
not
tell
where
you
were
between
the
hours
of
ten
and
eleven
on
a
certain
night
which
i
will
done
cried
the
other
bringing
out
his
and
laying
it
on
the
table
before
him
joe
followed
his
example
and
then
summoned
me
write
a
date
down
here
he
commanded
pushing
a
piece
of
paper
towards
me
with
a
look
keen
as
the
flash
of
a
blade
any
date
man
he
added
as
i
appeared
to
hesitate
in
the
embarrassment
i
thought
natural
under
the
circumstances
put
down
day
month
and
year
only
don
t
go
too
far
back
not
farther
than
two
smiling
with
the
air
of
a
flunkey
admitted
to
the
sports
of
his
superiors
i
wrote
a
line
and
laid
it
before
smithers
who
at
once
pushed
it
with
a
careless
gesture
towards
his
companion
you
can
of
course
guess
the
date
i
made
use
of
july
t
who
had
evidently
looked
upon
this
matter
as
mere
play
flushed
scarlet
as
he
read
these
words
and
for
one
instant
looked
as
if
he
had
rather
fly
the
house
than
answer
joe
smithers
s
nonchalant
glance
of
inquiry
i
have
given
my
word
and
will
keep
it
he
said
at
last
but
with
a
look
in
my
direction
that
sent
me
reluctantly
back
to
my
retreat
i
don
t
suppose
you
want
names
he
went
on
that
is
if
anything
i
have
to
tell
is
of
a
delicate
nature
oh
no
answered
the
other
only
facts
and
i
don
t
think
places
are
necessary
either
he
returned
i
will
tell
you
what
i
did
and
that
must
serve
you
i
did
not
promise
to
give
number
and
well
well
joe
exclaimed
earn
your
fifty
that
is
all
show
that
you
remember
where
you
were
on
the
night
of
and
with
an
admirable
show
of
indifference
he
pretended
to
consult
the
paper
between
them
the
seventeenth
of
july
two
years
ago
and
i
shall
be
i
was
at
the
club
for
one
thing
said
then
i
went
to
see
a
lady
friend
where
i
stayed
until
eleven
she
wore
a
blue
muslin
what
is
that
i
had
betrayed
myself
by
a
quick
movement
which
sent
a
glass
tumbler
crashing
to
the
floor
zulma
zabriskie
had
worn
a
blue
muslin
on
that
same
night
you
will
find
it
noted
in
the
report
given
me
by
the
policeman
who
saw
her
on
their
balcony
that
noise
it
was
joe
who
was
speaking
you
don
t
know
reuben
as
well
as
i
do
or
you
wouldn
t
ask
it
is
his
practice
i
am
sorry
to
say
to
accentuate
his
pleasure
in
draining
my
bottles
by
dropping
a
glass
at
every
third
t
went
on
she
was
a
married
woman
and
i
thought
she
loved
me
but
and
this
is
the
greatest
proof
i
can
offer
you
that
i
am
giving
you
a
true
account
of
that
night
she
had
not
the
slightest
idea
of
the
extent
of
my
passion
and
only
consented
to
see
me
at
all
because
she
thought
poor
thing
that
a
word
from
her
would
set
me
straight
and
rid
her
of
attentions
she
evidently
failed
to
appreciate
a
sorry
figure
for
a
fellow
like
me
to
cut
but
you
caught
me
on
the
most
detestable
date
in
my
calendar
and
there
he
ceased
being
interesting
and
i
anxious
the
secret
of
a
crime
for
which
there
seemed
to
be
no
reasonable
explanation
is
no
longer
a
mystery
to
me
i
have
but
to
warn
miss
strange
he
had
got
thus
far
when
a
sound
in
the
room
behind
him
led
him
to
look
up
a
lady
had
entered
a
lady
heavily
veiled
and
trembling
with
what
appeared
to
be
an
intense
excitement
he
thought
he
knew
the
figure
but
the
person
whoever
it
was
stood
so
still
and
remained
so
silent
he
hesitated
to
address
her
which
seeing
she
pushed
up
her
veil
and
all
doubt
vanished
it
was
violet
herself
in
disregard
of
her
usual
practice
she
had
come
alone
to
the
office
this
meant
urgency
of
some
kind
had
she
too
sounded
this
mystery
no
or
her
aspect
would
not
have
worn
this
look
of
triumph
what
had
happened
then
he
made
an
instant
endeavour
to
find
out
you
have
news
he
quietly
remarked
good
news
i
should
judge
by
your
very
cheery
yes
i
think
i
have
found
the
way
of
bringing
zabriskie
to
astonished
beyond
measure
so
little
did
these
words
harmonize
with
the
impressions
and
conclusions
at
which
he
had
just
arrived
something
very
like
doubt
spoke
in
his
voice
as
he
answered
with
the
simple
exclamation
you
do
yes
he
is
obsessed
by
a
fixed
idea
and
must
be
given
an
opportunity
to
test
the
truth
of
that
idea
the
shock
of
finding
it
a
false
one
may
restore
him
to
his
normal
condition
he
believes
that
he
shot
hasbrouck
with
no
other
guidance
than
his
sense
of
hearing
now
if
it
can
be
proved
that
his
hearing
is
an
insufficient
guide
for
such
an
act
as
of
course
it
is
the
shock
of
the
discovery
may
clear
his
brain
of
its
cobwebs
zabriskie
thinks
so
and
the
police
what
s
that
the
police
yes
zabriskie
would
be
taken
before
them
again
this
morning
no
entreaties
on
the
part
of
his
wife
would
prevail
he
insisted
upon
his
guilt
and
asked
her
to
accompany
him
there
and
the
poor
woman
found
herself
forced
to
go
of
course
he
encountered
again
the
same
division
of
opinion
among
the
men
he
talked
with
three
out
of
the
four
judged
him
insane
which
observing
he
betrayed
great
agitation
and
reiterated
his
former
wish
to
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
prove
his
sanity
by
showing
his
skill
in
shooting
this
made
an
impression
and
a
disposition
was
shown
to
grant
his
request
then
and
there
but
zabriskie
would
not
listen
to
this
she
approved
of
the
experiment
but
begged
that
it
might
be
deferred
till
another
day
and
then
take
place
in
some
spot
remote
from
the
city
for
some
reason
they
heeded
her
and
she
has
just
telephoned
me
that
this
attempt
of
his
is
to
take
place
tomorrow
in
the
new
jersey
woods
i
am
sorry
that
this
should
have
been
put
through
without
you
and
when
i
tell
you
that
the
idea
originated
with
me
that
from
some
word
i
purposely
let
fall
one
day
they
both
conceived
this
plan
of
ending
the
uncertainty
that
was
devouring
their
lives
you
will
understand
my
excitement
and
the
need
i
have
of
your
support
tell
me
that
i
have
done
well
do
not
show
me
such
a
face
you
frighten
me
i
do
not
wish
to
frighten
you
i
merely
wish
to
know
just
who
are
going
on
this
some
members
of
the
police
zabriskie
his
wife
and
and
myself
she
begged
you
must
not
why
the
affair
is
to
be
kept
secret
the
doctor
will
shoot
fail
oh
she
suddenly
broke
in
alarmed
by
his
expression
you
think
he
will
not
fail
i
think
that
you
had
better
heed
my
advice
and
stay
out
of
it
the
affair
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
police
and
your
place
is
anywhere
but
where
they
but
i
go
as
her
particular
friend
they
have
given
her
the
privilege
of
taking
with
her
one
of
her
own
sex
and
she
has
chosen
me
i
shall
not
fail
her
father
is
away
and
if
the
awful
disappointment
you
suggest
awaits
her
there
is
all
the
more
reason
why
she
should
have
some
sympathetic
support
this
was
so
true
that
the
fresh
protest
he
was
about
to
utter
died
on
his
lips
instead
he
simply
remarked
as
he
bowed
her
out
i
foresee
that
we
shall
not
work
much
longer
together
you
are
nearing
the
end
of
your
he
never
forgot
the
smile
she
threw
back
at
him
v
there
are
some
events
which
impress
the
human
mind
so
deeply
that
their
memory
mingles
with
all
though
violet
had
made
it
a
rule
to
forget
as
soon
as
possible
the
tragic
episodes
incident
to
the
strange
career
upon
which
she
had
so
mysteriously
embarked
there
was
destined
to
be
one
scene
if
not
more
which
she
has
never
been
able
to
dismiss
at
will
this
was
the
sight
which
met
her
eyes
from
the
bow
of
the
small
boat
in
which
zabriskie
and
his
wife
were
rowed
over
to
jersey
on
the
afternoon
which
saw
the
end
of
this
most
sombre
drama
though
it
was
by
no
means
late
in
the
day
the
sun
was
already
sinking
and
the
bright
red
glare
which
filled
the
west
and
shone
full
upon
the
faces
of
the
half
dozen
people
before
her
added
much
to
the
tragic
nature
of
the
scene
though
she
was
far
from
comprehending
its
full
significance
the
doctor
sat
with
his
wife
in
the
stern
and
it
was
upon
their
faces
violet
s
glance
was
fixed
the
glare
shone
luridly
on
his
sightless
eyeballs
and
as
she
noticed
his
unwinking
lids
she
realized
as
never
before
what
it
was
to
be
blind
in
the
midst
of
sunshine
his
wife
s
eyes
on
the
contrary
were
lowered
but
there
was
a
look
of
hopeless
misery
in
her
colourless
face
which
made
her
appearance
infinitely
pathetic
and
violet
felt
confident
that
if
he
could
only
have
seen
her
he
would
not
have
maintained
the
cold
and
unresponsive
manner
which
chilled
the
words
on
his
poor
wife
s
lips
and
made
all
advance
on
her
part
impossible
on
the
seat
in
front
of
them
sat
an
inspector
and
from
some
quarter
possibly
from
under
the
inspector
s
coat
there
came
the
monotonous
ticking
of
the
small
clock
which
was
to
serve
as
a
target
for
the
blind
man
s
aim
this
ticking
was
all
violet
heard
though
the
river
was
alive
with
traffic
and
large
and
small
boats
were
steaming
by
them
on
every
side
and
i
am
sure
it
was
all
that
zabriskie
heard
also
as
with
hand
pressed
to
her
heart
and
eyes
fixed
on
the
opposite
shore
she
waited
for
the
event
which
was
to
determine
whether
the
man
she
loved
was
a
criminal
or
only
a
being
afflicted
of
god
and
worthy
of
her
unceasing
care
and
devotion
as
the
sun
cast
its
last
scarlet
gleam
over
the
water
the
boat
grounded
and
violet
was
enabled
to
have
one
passing
word
with
zabriskie
she
hardly
knew
what
she
said
but
the
look
she
received
in
return
was
like
that
of
a
frightened
child
but
there
was
always
to
be
seen
in
zabriskie
s
countenance
this
characteristic
blending
of
the
severe
and
the
childlike
and
beyond
an
added
pang
of
pity
for
this
beautiful
but
afflicted
woman
violet
let
the
moment
pass
without
giving
it
the
weight
it
perhaps
demanded
the
doctor
and
his
wife
had
a
long
talk
last
night
was
whispered
in
her
ear
as
she
wound
her
way
with
the
rest
into
the
heart
of
the
woods
with
a
start
she
turned
and
perceived
her
employer
following
close
behind
her
he
had
come
by
another
boat
but
it
did
not
seem
to
heal
whatever
breach
lies
between
them
he
proceeded
then
in
a
quick
anxious
tone
he
whispered
whatever
happens
do
not
lift
your
veil
i
thought
i
saw
a
reporter
skulking
in
the
i
will
be
careful
violet
assured
him
and
could
say
no
more
as
they
had
already
reached
the
ground
which
had
been
selected
for
this
trial
at
arms
and
the
various
members
of
the
party
were
being
placed
in
their
several
positions
the
doctor
to
whom
light
and
darkness
were
alike
stood
with
his
face
towards
the
western
glow
and
at
his
side
were
grouped
the
inspector
and
the
two
physicians
on
the
arm
of
one
of
the
latter
hung
zabriskie
s
overcoat
which
he
had
taken
off
as
soon
as
he
reached
the
field
zabriskie
stood
at
the
other
end
of
the
opening
near
a
tall
stump
upon
which
it
had
been
decided
that
the
clock
should
be
placed
when
the
moment
came
for
the
doctor
to
show
his
skill
she
had
been
accorded
the
privilege
of
setting
the
clock
on
this
stump
and
violet
saw
it
shining
in
her
hand
as
she
paused
for
a
moment
to
glance
back
at
the
circle
of
gentlemen
who
were
awaiting
her
movements
the
hands
of
the
clock
stood
at
five
minutes
to
five
though
violet
scarcely
noted
it
at
the
time
for
zabriskie
was
passing
her
and
had
stopped
to
say
if
he
is
not
himself
he
can
not
be
trusted
watch
him
carefully
and
see
that
he
does
no
mischief
to
himself
or
others
ask
one
of
the
inspectors
to
stand
at
his
right
hand
and
stop
him
if
he
does
not
handle
his
pistol
violet
promised
and
she
passed
on
setting
the
clock
upon
the
stump
and
immediately
drawing
back
to
a
suitable
distance
at
the
right
where
she
stood
wrapped
in
her
long
dark
cloak
her
face
shone
ghastly
white
even
in
its
environment
of
boughs
and
noting
this
violet
wished
the
minutes
fewer
between
the
present
moment
and
the
hour
of
five
at
which
time
he
was
to
draw
the
trigger
dr
zabriskie
quoth
the
inspector
we
have
endeavoured
to
make
this
trial
a
perfectly
fair
one
you
are
to
have
a
shot
at
a
small
clock
which
has
been
placed
within
a
suitable
distance
and
which
you
are
expected
to
hit
guided
only
by
the
sound
which
it
will
make
in
striking
the
hour
of
five
are
you
satisfied
with
the
arrangement
perfectly
where
is
my
wife
on
the
other
side
of
the
field
some
ten
paces
from
the
stump
upon
which
the
clock
is
he
bowed
and
his
face
showed
satisfaction
may
i
expect
the
clock
to
strike
soon
in
less
than
five
minutes
was
the
answer
then
let
me
have
the
pistol
i
wish
to
become
acquainted
with
its
size
and
we
glanced
at
each
other
then
across
at
her
she
made
a
gesture
it
was
one
of
acquiescence
immediately
the
inspector
placed
the
weapon
in
the
blind
man
s
hand
it
was
at
once
apparent
that
he
understood
the
instrument
and
violet
s
hopes
which
had
been
strong
up
to
this
moment
sank
at
his
air
of
confidence
thank
god
i
am
blind
this
hour
and
can
not
see
her
fell
from
his
lips
then
before
the
echo
of
these
words
had
died
away
he
raised
his
voice
and
observed
calmly
enough
considering
that
he
was
about
to
prove
himself
a
criminal
in
order
to
save
himself
from
being
thought
a
madman
let
no
one
move
i
must
have
my
ears
free
for
catching
the
first
stroke
of
the
and
he
raised
the
pistol
before
him
there
was
a
moment
of
torturing
suspense
and
deep
unbroken
silence
violet
s
eyes
were
on
him
so
she
did
not
watch
the
clock
but
she
was
suddenly
moved
by
some
irresistible
impulse
to
note
how
zabriskie
was
bearing
herself
at
this
critical
moment
and
casting
a
hurried
glance
in
her
direction
she
perceived
her
tall
figure
swaying
from
side
to
side
as
if
under
an
intolerable
strain
of
feeling
her
eyes
were
on
the
clock
the
hands
of
which
seemed
to
creep
with
pace
along
the
dial
when
unexpectedly
and
a
full
minute
before
the
minute
hand
had
reached
the
stroke
of
five
violet
caught
a
movement
on
her
part
saw
the
flash
of
something
round
and
white
show
for
an
instant
against
the
darkness
of
her
cloak
and
was
about
to
shriek
warning
to
the
doctor
when
the
shrill
quick
stroke
of
a
clock
rang
out
on
the
frosty
air
followed
by
the
ping
and
flash
of
a
pistol
a
sound
of
shattered
glass
followed
by
a
suppressed
cry
told
the
bystanders
that
the
bullet
had
struck
the
mark
but
before
any
one
could
move
or
they
could
rid
their
eyes
of
the
smoke
which
the
wind
had
blown
into
their
faces
there
came
another
sound
which
made
their
hair
stand
on
end
and
sent
the
blood
back
in
terror
to
their
hearts
another
clock
was
striking
which
they
now
perceived
was
still
standing
upright
on
the
stump
where
zabriskie
had
placed
it
whence
came
the
clock
then
which
had
struck
before
the
time
and
been
shattered
for
its
pains
one
quick
look
told
them
on
the
ground
ten
paces
to
the
right
lay
zulma
zabriskie
a
broken
clock
at
her
side
and
in
her
breast
a
bullet
which
was
fast
sapping
the
life
from
her
sweet
eyes
they
had
to
tell
him
there
was
such
pleading
in
her
looks
and
never
will
any
of
the
hearers
forget
the
scream
which
rang
from
his
lips
as
he
realized
the
truth
breaking
from
their
midst
he
rushed
forward
and
fell
at
her
feet
as
if
guided
by
some
supernatural
instinct
zulma
he
shrieked
what
is
this
were
not
my
hands
dyed
deep
enough
in
blood
that
you
should
make
me
answerable
for
your
life
also
her
eyes
were
closed
but
she
opened
them
looking
long
and
steadily
at
his
agonized
face
she
faltered
forth
it
is
not
you
who
have
killed
me
it
is
your
crime
had
you
been
innocent
of
hasbrouck
s
death
your
bullet
would
never
have
found
my
heart
did
you
think
i
could
survive
the
proof
that
you
had
killed
that
good
man
i
did
it
unwittingly
i
hush
she
commanded
with
an
awful
look
which
happily
he
could
not
see
i
had
another
motive
i
wished
to
prove
to
you
even
at
the
cost
of
my
life
that
i
loved
you
had
always
loved
you
and
not
it
was
now
his
turn
to
silence
her
his
hand
crept
to
her
lips
and
his
despairing
face
turned
itself
blindly
towards
those
about
them
go
he
cried
leave
us
let
me
take
a
last
farewell
of
my
dying
wife
without
listeners
or
consulting
the
eye
of
her
employer
who
stood
close
beside
her
and
seeing
no
hope
in
it
violet
fell
slowly
back
the
others
followed
and
the
doctor
was
left
alone
with
his
wife
from
the
distant
position
they
took
they
saw
her
arms
creep
round
his
neck
saw
her
head
fall
confidingly
on
his
breast
then
silence
settled
upon
them
and
upon
all
nature
the
gathering
twilight
deepening
till
the
last
glow
disappeared
from
the
heavens
above
and
from
the
circle
of
leafless
trees
which
enclosed
this
tragedy
from
the
outside
world
but
at
last
there
came
a
stir
and
zabriskie
rising
up
before
them
with
the
dead
body
of
his
wife
held
closely
to
his
breast
confronted
them
with
a
countenance
so
rapturous
that
he
looked
like
a
man
transfigured
i
will
carry
her
to
the
boat
said
he
not
another
hand
shall
touch
her
she
was
my
true
wife
my
true
wife
and
he
towered
into
an
attitude
of
such
dignity
and
passion
that
for
a
moment
he
took
on
heroic
proportions
and
they
forgot
that
he
had
just
proved
himself
to
have
committed
a
and
ghastly
crime
the
stars
were
shining
when
the
party
again
took
their
seats
in
the
boat
and
if
the
scene
of
their
crossing
to
jersey
was
impressive
what
shall
be
said
of
the
return
the
doctor
as
before
sat
in
the
stern
an
awesome
figure
upon
which
the
moon
shone
with
a
white
radiance
that
seemed
to
lift
his
face
out
of
the
surrounding
darkness
and
set
it
like
an
image
of
frozen
horror
before
their
eyes
against
his
breast
he
held
the
form
of
his
dead
wife
and
now
and
then
violet
saw
him
stoop
as
if
he
were
listening
for
some
token
of
life
from
her
set
lips
then
he
would
lift
himself
again
with
hopelessness
stamped
upon
his
features
only
to
lean
forward
in
renewed
hope
that
was
again
destined
to
disappointment
violet
had
been
so
overcome
by
this
tragic
end
to
all
her
hopes
that
her
employer
had
been
allowed
to
enter
the
boat
with
her
seated
at
her
side
in
the
seat
directly
in
front
of
the
doctor
he
watched
with
her
these
simple
tokens
of
a
breaking
heart
saying
nothing
till
they
reached
midstream
when
true
to
his
instincts
for
all
his
awe
and
compassion
he
suddenly
bent
towards
him
and
said
dr
zabriskie
the
mystery
of
your
crime
is
no
longer
a
mystery
to
me
listen
and
see
if
i
do
not
understand
your
temptation
and
how
you
a
conscientious
and
man
came
to
slay
your
innocent
neighbour
a
friend
of
yours
or
so
he
called
himself
had
for
a
long
time
filled
your
ears
with
tales
tending
to
make
you
suspicious
of
your
wife
and
jealous
of
a
certain
man
whom
i
will
not
name
you
knew
that
your
friend
had
a
grudge
against
this
man
and
so
for
many
months
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
his
insinuations
but
finally
some
change
which
you
detected
in
your
wife
s
bearing
or
conversation
roused
your
own
suspicions
and
you
began
to
doubt
her
truth
and
to
curse
your
blindness
which
in
a
measure
rendered
you
helpless
the
jealous
fever
grew
and
had
risen
to
a
high
point
when
one
night
a
memorable
night
this
friend
met
you
just
as
you
were
leaving
town
and
with
cruel
craft
whispered
in
your
ear
that
the
man
you
hated
was
even
then
with
your
wife
and
that
if
you
would
return
at
once
to
your
home
you
would
find
him
in
her
company
the
demon
that
lurks
at
the
heart
of
all
men
good
or
bad
thereupon
took
complete
possession
of
you
and
you
answered
this
false
friend
by
saying
that
you
would
not
return
without
a
pistol
whereupon
he
offered
to
take
you
to
his
house
and
give
you
his
you
consented
and
getting
rid
of
your
servant
by
sending
him
to
poughkeepsie
with
your
excuses
you
entered
your
friend
s
automobile
you
say
you
bought
the
pistol
and
perhaps
you
did
but
however
that
may
be
you
left
his
house
with
it
in
your
pocket
and
declining
companionship
walked
home
arriving
at
the
colonnade
a
little
before
midnight
ordinarily
you
have
no
difficulty
in
recognizing
your
own
doorstep
but
being
in
a
heated
frame
of
mind
you
walked
faster
than
usual
and
so
passed
your
own
house
and
stopped
at
that
of
hasbrouck
one
door
beyond
as
the
entrances
of
these
houses
are
all
alike
there
was
but
one
way
by
which
you
could
have
made
yourself
sure
that
you
had
reached
your
own
dwelling
and
that
was
by
feeling
for
the
doctor
s
sign
at
the
side
of
the
door
but
you
never
thought
of
that
absorbed
in
dreams
of
vengeance
your
sole
impulse
was
to
enter
by
the
quickest
means
possible
taking
out
your
night
key
you
thrust
it
into
the
lock
it
fitted
but
it
took
strength
to
turn
it
so
much
strength
that
the
key
was
twisted
and
bent
by
the
effort
but
this
incident
which
would
have
attracted
your
attention
at
another
time
was
lost
upon
you
at
this
moment
an
entrance
had
been
effected
and
you
were
in
too
excited
a
frame
of
mind
to
notice
at
what
cost
or
to
detect
the
small
differences
apparent
in
the
atmosphere
and
furnishings
of
the
two
houses
trifles
which
would
have
arrested
your
attention
under
other
circumstances
and
made
you
pause
before
the
upper
floor
had
been
reached
it
was
while
going
up
the
stairs
that
you
took
out
your
pistol
so
that
by
the
time
you
arrived
at
the
front
room
door
you
held
it
already
drawn
and
cocked
in
your
hand
for
being
blind
you
feared
escape
on
the
part
of
your
victim
and
so
waited
for
nothing
but
the
sound
of
a
man
s
voice
before
firing
when
therefore
the
unfortunate
hasbrouck
roused
by
this
sudden
intrusion
advanced
with
an
exclamation
of
astonishment
you
pulled
the
trigger
and
killed
him
on
the
spot
it
must
have
been
immediately
upon
his
fall
that
you
recognized
from
some
word
he
uttered
or
from
some
contact
you
may
have
had
with
your
surroundings
that
you
were
in
the
wrong
house
and
had
killed
the
wrong
man
for
you
cried
out
in
evident
remorse
god
what
have
i
done
and
fled
without
approaching
your
victim
descending
the
stairs
you
rushed
from
the
house
closing
the
front
door
behind
you
and
regaining
your
own
without
being
seen
but
here
you
found
yourself
baffled
in
your
attempted
escape
by
two
things
first
by
the
pistol
you
still
held
in
your
hand
and
secondly
by
the
fact
that
the
key
upon
which
you
depended
for
entering
your
own
door
was
so
twisted
out
of
shape
that
you
knew
it
would
be
useless
for
you
to
attempt
to
use
it
what
did
you
do
in
this
emergency
you
have
already
told
us
though
the
story
seemed
so
improbable
at
the
time
you
found
nobody
to
believe
it
but
myself
the
pistol
you
flung
far
away
from
you
down
the
pavement
from
which
by
one
of
those
rare
chances
which
sometimes
happen
in
this
world
it
was
presently
picked
up
by
some
late
of
more
or
less
doubtful
character
the
door
offered
less
of
an
obstacle
than
you
had
anticipated
for
when
you
turned
again
you
found
it
if
i
am
not
greatly
mistaken
ajar
left
so
as
we
have
reason
to
believe
by
one
who
had
gone
out
of
it
but
a
few
minutes
before
in
a
state
which
left
him
but
little
master
of
his
actions
it
was
this
fact
which
provided
you
with
an
answer
when
you
were
asked
how
you
succeeded
in
getting
into
hasbrouck
s
house
after
the
family
had
retired
for
the
night
astonished
at
the
coincidence
but
hailing
with
gladness
the
deliverance
which
it
offered
you
went
in
and
ascended
at
once
into
your
wife
s
presence
and
it
was
from
her
lips
and
not
from
those
of
hasbrouck
that
the
cry
arose
which
startled
the
neighbourhood
and
prepared
men
s
minds
for
the
tragic
words
which
were
shouted
a
moment
later
from
the
next
house
but
she
who
uttered
the
scream
knew
of
no
tragedy
save
that
which
was
taking
place
in
her
own
breast
she
had
just
repulsed
a
dastardly
suitor
and
seeing
you
enter
so
unexpectedly
in
a
state
of
unaccountable
horror
and
agitation
was
naturally
stricken
with
dismay
and
thought
she
saw
your
ghost
or
what
was
worse
a
possible
avenger
while
you
having
failed
to
kill
the
man
you
sought
and
having
killed
a
man
you
esteemed
let
no
surprise
on
her
part
lure
you
into
any
dangerous
you
strove
instead
to
soothe
her
and
even
attempted
to
explain
the
excitement
under
which
you
laboured
by
an
account
of
your
narrow
escape
at
the
station
till
the
sudden
alarm
from
next
door
distracted
her
attention
and
sent
both
your
thoughts
and
hers
in
a
different
direction
not
till
conscience
had
fully
awakened
and
the
horror
of
your
act
had
had
time
to
tell
upon
your
sensitive
nature
did
you
breathe
forth
those
vague
confessions
which
not
being
supported
by
the
only
explanations
which
would
have
made
them
credible
led
her
as
well
as
the
police
to
consider
you
affected
in
your
mind
your
pride
as
a
man
and
your
consideration
for
her
as
a
woman
kept
you
silent
but
did
not
keep
the
worm
from
preying
upon
your
heart
am
i
not

is
not

the
true
explanation
of
your
crime
with

lifted

his

you

waken

how
peacefully
she

i
should
not
like
to
have
her
wakened

she

tired
and
i
i
have
not
watched
over
her
as
i
appalled
at
his
gesture
his
look
his
tone
violet
drew
back
and
for
a
few
minutes
no
sound
was
to
be
heard
but
the
steady
of
the
oars
and
the
of
the
waters
against
the
boat
then
there
came
a
quick
uprising
the
swaying
before
her
of
something
dark
and
tall
and
threatening
and
before
she
could
speak
or
move
or
even
stretch
forth
her
hands
to
stay
him
the
seat
before
her
was
empty
and
darkness
had
filled
the
place
where
but
an
instant
previous
he
had
sat
a
fearsome
figure
erect
and
rigid
as
a
sphinx
what
little
moonlight
there
was
only
served
to
show
a
few
rising
bubbles
marking
the
spot
where
the
unfortunate
man
had
sunk
with
his
burden
as
the
widening
circles
fled
farther
and
farther
out
the
tide
drifted
the
boat
away
and
the
spot
was
lost

had
seen

termination

puss
why
one

you
have
earned
the
amount
you
set
for
yourself

very
nearly
and
though
my

i
can

no
you
can
not
arthur
you
are
doing
well
i
appreciate
it
in
fact
i
am
just
delighted
to
have
you
work
for
me
in
the
way
you
do
but
you
can
not
in
your
present
position
make
enough
in
three
months
or
in
six
to
meet
the
situation
as
i
see
it
enough

satisfy
me
the

must
be
full
heaped
up
and
running
over
possible
failure
following
promise
must
be
provided
for
never
must
i
feel
myself
called
upon
to
do
this
kind
of

again
besides
i
have
never
got
over
the
zabriskie
tragedy
it
haunts
me
continually
something
new
may
help
to
put
it
out
of
my
head
i
feel
guilty
i
was

no
puss
i
will
not
have
it
that
you

some
such

later

to
shoot

but
not
no
not
her
but
do
you
think
she
would
have
given
those
few
minutes
of
perfect
understanding
with
her
blind
husband
for
a
few
years
more
of
miserable
life
violet
made
no
answer
she
was
too
absorbed
in
her
surprise
was
this
arthur
had
a
few
weeks
work
and
a
close
connection
with
the
really
serious
things
of
life
made
this
change
in
him
her
face
beamed
at
the
thought
which
seeing
but
not
understanding
what
underlay
this
evidence
of
joy
he
bent
and
kissed
her
saying
with
some
of
his
old
nonchalance
forget
it
violet
only
don
t
let
any
one
or
anything
lead
you
to
interest
yourself
in
another
affair
of
the
kind
if
you
do
i
shall
have
to
consult
a
certain
friend
of
yours
as
to
the
best
way
of
stopping
this
folly
i
mention
no
names
oh
you
need
not
look
so
frightened
only
behave
that
s
he
s
right
she
acknowledged
to
herself
as
he
sauntered
away
altogether
yet
because
she
wanted
the
extra
money
the
scene
invited
alarm
that
is
for
so
young
a
girl
as
violet
surveying
it
from
an
automobile
some
time
after
the
stroke
of
midnight
an
unknown
house
at
the
end
of
a
heavily
shaded
walk
in
the
open
doorway
of
which
could
be
seen
the
silhouette
of
a
woman
s
form
leaning
eagerly
forward
with
arms
outstretched
in
an
appeal
for
help
it
vanished
while
she
looked
but
the
effect
remained
holding
her
to
her
seat
for
one
startled
moment
this
seemed
strange
for
she
had
anticipated
adventure
one
is
not
summoned
from
a
private
ball
to
ride
a
dozen
miles
into
the
country
on
an
errand
of
investigation
without
some
expectation
of
encountering
the
mysterious
and
the
tragic
but
violet
strange
for
all
her
many
experiences
was
of
a
most
susceptible
nature
and
for
the
instant
in
which
that
door
stood
open
with
only
the
memory
of
that
expectant
figure
to
disturb
the
faintly
lit
vista
of
the
hall
beyond
she
felt
that
grip
upon
the
throat
which
comes
from
an
indefinable
fear
which
no
words
can
explain
and
no
plummet
sound
but
this
soon
passed
with
the
setting
of
her
foot
to
ground
conditions
changed
and
her
emotions
took
on
a
more
normal
character
the
figure
of
a
man
now
stood
in
the
place
held
by
the
vanished
woman
and
it
was
not
only
that
of
one
she
knew
but
that
of
one
whom
she
trusted
a
friend
whose
very
presence
gave
her
courage
with
this
recognition
came
a
better
understanding
of
the
situation
and
it
was
with
a
beaming
eye
and
unclouded
features
that
she
tripped
up
the
walk
to
meet
the
expectant
figure
and
outstretched
hand
of
roger
upjohn
you
here
she
exclaimed
amid
smiles
and
blushes
as
he
drew
her
into
the
hall
he
at
once
launched
forth
into
explanations
mingled
with
apologies
for
the
presumption
he
had
shown
in
putting
her
to
this
inconvenience
there
was
trouble
in
the
house
great
trouble
something
had
occurred
for
which
an
explanation
must
be
found
before
morning
or
the
happiness
and
honour
of
more
than
one
person
now
under
this
unhappy
roof
would
be
wrecked
he
knew
it
was
late
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
take
a
long
and
dreary
ride
alone
but
her
success
with
the
problem
which
had
once
come
near
wrecking
his
own
life
had
emboldened
him
to
telephone
to
the
office
and
but
you
are
in
he
cried
in
amazement
did
you
think
i
came
from
a
ball
word
reached
me
between
the
dances
i
did
not
go
home
i
had
been
bidden
to
he
looked
his
appreciation
but
when
he
spoke
it
was
to
say
this
is
the
situation
miss
digby
the
lady
who
is
to
be
married
tomorrow
who
hopes
to
be
married
how
hopes
who
will
be
married
tomorrow
if
a
certain
article
lost
in
this
house
tonight
can
be
found
before
any
of
the
persons
who
have
been
dining
here
leave
for
their
violet
uttered
an
exclamation
then
cornell
she
began
mr
cornell
has
our
utmost
confidence
roger
hastened
to
interpose
but
the
article
missing
is
one
which
he
might
reasonably
desire
to
possess
and
which
he
alone
of
all
present
had
the
opportunity
of
securing
you
can
therefore
see
why
he
with
his
pride
the
pride
off
a
man
not
rich
engaged
to
marry
a
woman
who
is
should
declare
that
unless
his
innocence
is
established
before
daybreak
the
doors
of
bartholomew
will
remain
shut
but
the
article
lost
what
is
it
miss
digby
will
give
you
the
particulars
she
is
waiting
to
receive
you
he
added
with
a
gesture
towards
a
door
at
their
right
violet
glanced
that
way
then
cast
her
looks
up
and
down
the
hall
in
which
they
stood
do
you
know
that
you
have
not
told
me
in
whose
house
i
am
not
hers
i
know
she
lives
in
the
and
you
are
twelve
miles
from
harlem
miss
strange
you
are
in
the
van
broecklyn
mansion
famous
enough
you
will
acknowledge
have
you
never
been
here
before
i
have
been
by
here
but
i
recognized
nothing
in
the
dark
what
an
exciting
place
for
an
investigation
and
van
broecklyn
have
you
never
met
him
once
when
a
child
he
frightened
me
and
may
frighten
you
now
though
i
doubt
it
time
has
mellowed
him
besides
i
have
prepared
him
for
what
might
otherwise
occasion
him
some
astonishment
naturally
he
would
not
look
for
just
the
sort
of
lady
investigator
i
am
about
to
introduce
to
she
smiled
violet
strange
was
a
very
charming
young
woman
as
well
as
a
keen
prober
of
odd
mysteries
the
meeting
between
herself
and
miss
digby
was
a
sympathetic
one
after
the
first
inevitable
shock
which
the
latter
felt
at
sight
of
the
beauty
and
fashionable
appearance
of
the
mysterious
little
being
who
was
to
solve
her
difficulties
her
glance
which
under
other
circumstances
might
have
lingered
unduly
upon
the
piquant
features
and
exquisite
dressing
of
the
figure
before
her
passed
at
once
to
violet
s
eyes
in
whose
steady
depths
beamed
an
intelligence
quite
at
odds
with
the
coquettish
dimples
which
so
often
misled
the
casual
observer
in
his
estimation
of
a
character
singularly
subtle
and
as
for
the
impression
she
herself
made
upon
violet
it
was
the
same
she
made
upon
everyone
no
one
could
look
long
at
florence
digby
and
not
recognize
the
loftiness
of
her
spirit
and
the
generous
nature
of
her
impulses
in
person
she
was
tall
and
as
she
leaned
to
take
violet
s
hand
the
difference
between
them
brought
out
the
salient
points
in
each
to
the
great
admiration
of
the
one
onlooker
meantime
for
all
her
interest
in
the
case
in
hand
violet
could
not
help
casting
a
hurried
look
about
her
in
gratification
of
the
curiosity
incited
by
her
entrance
into
a
house
signalized
from
its
foundation
by
such
a
series
of
tragic
events
the
result
was
disappointing
the
walls
were
plain
the
furniture
simple
nothing
suggestive
in
either
unless
it
was
the
fact
that
nothing
was
new
nothing
modern
as
it
looked
in
the
days
of
burr
and
hamilton
so
it
looked
even
to
the
rather
startling
detail
of
candles
which
did
duty
on
every
side
in
place
of
gas
as
violet
recalled
the
reason
for
this
the
fascination
of
the
past
seized
upon
her
imagination
there
was
no
knowing
where
this
might
have
carried
her
had
not
the
feverish
gleam
in
miss
digby
s
eyes
warned
her
that
the
present
held
its
own
excitement
instantly
she
was
all
attention
and
listening
with
undivided
mind
to
that
lady
s
disclosures
they
were
brief
and
to
the
following
effect
the
dinner
which
had
brought
some
people
together
in
this
house
had
been
given
in
celebration
of
her
impending
marriage
but
it
was
also
in
a
way
meant
as
a
compliment
to
one
of
the
other
guests
a
spielhagen
who
during
the
week
had
succeeded
in
demonstrating
to
a
few
experts
the
value
of
a
discovery
he
had
made
which
would
transform
a
great
industry
in
speaking
of
this
discovery
miss
digby
did
not
go
into
particulars
the
whole
matter
being
far
beyond
her
understanding
but
in
stating
its
value
she
openly
acknowledged
that
it
was
in
the
line
of
cornell
s
own
work
and
one
which
involved
calculations
and
a
formula
which
if
prematurely
disclosed
would
invalidate
the
contract
spielhagen
hoped
to
make
and
thus
destroy
his
present
hopes
of
this
formula
but
two
copies
existed
one
was
locked
up
in
a
safe
deposit
vault
in
boston
the
other
he
had
brought
into
the
house
on
his
person
and
it
was
the
latter
which
was
now
missing
having
been
abstracted
during
the
evening
from
a
manuscript
of
sixteen
or
more
sheets
under
circumstances
which
she
would
now
endeavour
to
relate
van
broecklyn
their
host
had
in
his
melancholy
life
but
one
interest
which
could
be
at
all
absorbing
this
was
for
explosives
as
consequence
much
of
the
talk
at
the
had
been
on
spielhagen
s
discovery
and
possible
changes
it
might
introduce
into
this
especial
industry
as
these
worked
out
from
a
formula
kept
secret
from
the
trade
could
not
but
affect
greatly
cornell
s
interests
she
found
herself
listening
intently
when
van
broecklyn
with
an
apology
for
his
interference
ventured
to
remark
that
if
spielhagen
had
made
a
valuable
discovery
in
this
line
so
had
he
and
one
which
he
had
substantiated
by
many
experiments
it
was
not
a
marketable
one
such
as
spielhagen
s
was
but
in
his
work
upon
the
same
and
in
the
tests
which
he
had
been
led
to
make
he
had
discovered
certain
instances
he
would
gladly
name
which
demanded
exceptional
procedure
to
be
successful
if
spielhagen
s
method
did
not
allow
for
these
exceptions
nor
make
suitable
provision
for
them
then
spielhagen
s
method
would
fail
more
times
than
it
would
succeed
did
it
so
allow
and
so
provide
it
would
relieve
him
greatly
to
learn
that
it
did
the
answer
came
quickly
yes
it
did
but
later
and
after
some
further
conversation
spielhagen
s
confidence
seemed
to
wane
and
before
they
left
the
he
openly
declared
his
intention
of
looking
over
his
manuscript
again
that
very
night
in
order
to
be
sure
that
the
formula
therein
contained
duly
covered
all
the
exceptions
mentioned
by
van
broecklyn
if
cornell
s
countenance
showed
any
change
at
this
moment
she
for
one
had
not
noticed
it
but
the
bitterness
with
which
he
remarked
upon
the
other
s
good
fortune
in
having
discovered
this
formula
of
whose
entire
success
he
had
no
doubt
was
apparent
to
everybody
and
naturally
gave
point
to
the
circumstances
which
a
short
time
afterward
associated
him
with
the
disappearance
of
the
same
the
ladies
there
were
two
others
besides
herself
having
withdrawn
in
a
body
to
the
the
gentlemen
all
proceeded
to
the
library
to
smoke
here
conversation
loosed
from
the
one
topic
which
had
hitherto
engrossed
it
was
proceeding
briskly
when
spielhagen
with
nervous
gesture
impulsively
looked
about
him
and
said
i
can
not
rest
till
i
have
run
through
my
thesis
again
where
can
i
find
a
quiet
spot
i
won
t
be
long
i
read
very
it
was
for
van
broecklyn
to
answer
but
no
word
coming
from
him
every
eye
turned
his
way
only
to
find
him
sunk
in
one
of
those
fits
of
abstraction
so
well
known
to
his
friends
and
from
which
no
one
who
has
this
strange
man
s
peace
of
mind
at
heart
ever
presumes
to
rouse
him
what
was
to
be
done
these
moods
of
their
singular
host
sometimes
lasted
half
an
hour
and
spielhagen
had
not
the
appearance
of
a
man
of
patience
indeed
he
presently
gave
proof
of
the
great
uneasiness
he
was
labouring
under
for
noticing
a
door
standing
ajar
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
he
remarked
to
those
around
him
a
den
and
lighted
do
you
see
any
objection
to
my
shutting
myself
in
there
for
a
few
minutes
no
one
venturing
to
reply
he
rose
and
giving
a
slight
push
to
the
door
disclosed
a
small
room
exquisitely
panelled
and
brightly
lighted
but
without
one
article
of
furniture
in
it
not
even
a
chair
the
very
place
quoth
spielhagen
and
lifting
a
light
chair
from
the
many
standing
about
he
carried
it
inside
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
several
minutes
passed
during
which
the
man
who
had
served
at
table
entered
with
a
tray
on
which
were
several
small
glasses
evidently
containing
some
choice
liqueur
finding
his
master
fixed
in
one
of
his
strange
moods
he
set
the
tray
down
and
pointing
to
one
of
the
glasses
said
that
is
for
van
broecklyn
it
contains
his
usual
quieting
and
urging
the
gentlemen
to
help
themselves
he
quietly
left
the
room
upjohn
lifted
the
glass
nearest
him
and
cornell
seemed
about
to
do
the
same
when
he
suddenly
reached
forward
and
catching
up
one
farther
off
started
for
the
room
in
which
spielhagen
had
so
deliberately
secluded
himself
why
he
did
all
this
why
above
all
things
he
should
reach
across
the
tray
for
a
glass
instead
of
taking
the
one
under
his
hand
he
can
no
more
explain
than
why
he
has
followed
many
another
unhappy
impulse
nor
did
he
understand
the
nervous
start
given
by
spielhagen
at
his
entrance
or
the
stare
with
which
that
gentleman
took
the
glass
from
his
hand
and
mechanically
drank
its
contents
till
he
saw
how
his
hand
had
stretched
itself
across
the
sheet
of
paper
he
was
reading
in
an
open
attempt
to
hide
the
lines
visible
between
his
fingers
then
indeed
the
intruder
flushed
and
withdrew
in
great
embarrassment
fully
conscious
of
his
indiscretion
but
not
deeply
disturbed
till
van
broecklyn
suddenly
arousing
and
glancing
down
at
the
tray
placed
very
near
his
hand
remarked
in
some
surprise
dobbs
seems
to
have
forgotten
then
indeed
the
unfortunate
cornell
realized
what
he
had
done
it
was
the
glass
intended
for
his
host
which
he
had
caught
up
and
carried
into
the
other
room
the
glass
which
he
had
been
told
contained
a
drug
of
what
folly
he
had
been
guilty
and
how
tame
would
be
any
effort
at
excuse
attempting
none
he
rose
and
with
a
hurried
glance
at
upjohn
who
flushed
in
sympathy
at
his
distress
he
crossed
to
the
door
he
had
lately
closed
upon
spielhagen
but
feeling
his
shoulder
touched
as
his
hand
pressed
the
knob
he
turned
to
meet
the
eye
of
van
broecklyn
fixed
upon
him
with
an
expression
which
utterly
confounded
him
where
are
you
going
that
gentleman
asked
the
questioning
tone
the
severe
look
expressive
at
once
of
displeasure
and
astonishment
were
most
disconcerting
but
cornell
managed
to
stammer
forth
mr
spielhagen
is
in
here
consulting
his
thesis
when
your
man
brought
in
the
cordial
i
was
awkward
enough
to
catch
up
your
glass
and
carry
it
in
to
spielhagen
he
drank
it
and
i
i
am
anxious
to
see
if
it
did
him
any
as
he
uttered
the
last
word
he
felt
van
broecklyn
s
hand
slip
from
his
shoulder
but
no
word
accompanied
the
action
nor
did
his
host
make
the
least
move
to
follow
him
into
the
room
this
was
a
matter
of
great
regret
to
him
later
as
it
left
him
for
a
moment
out
of
the
range
of
every
eye
during
which
he
says
he
simply
stood
in
a
state
of
shock
at
seeing
spielhagen
still
sitting
there
manuscript
in
hand
but
with
head
fallen
forward
and
eyes
closed
dead
asleep
or
he
hardly
knew
what
the
sight
so
paralysed
him
whether
or
not
this
was
the
exact
truth
and
the
whole
truth
cornell
certainly
looked
very
unlike
himself
as
he
stepped
back
into
van
broecklyn
s
presence
and
he
was
only
partially
reassured
when
that
gentleman
protested
that
there
was
no
real
harm
in
the
drug
and
that
spielhagen
would
be
all
right
if
left
to
wake
naturally
and
without
shock
however
as
his
present
attitude
was
one
of
great
discomfort
they
decided
to
carry
him
back
and
lay
him
on
the
library
lounge
but
before
doing
this
upjohn
drew
from
his
flaccid
grasp
the
precious
manuscript
and
carrying
it
into
the
larger
room
placed
it
on
a
remote
table
where
it
remained
undisturbed
till
spielhagen
suddenly
coming
to
himself
at
the
end
of
some
fifteen
minutes
missed
the
sheets
from
his
hand
and
bounding
up
crossed
the
room
to
repossess
himself
of
them
his
face
as
he
lifted
them
up
and
rapidly
ran
through
them
with
anxiety
told
them
what
they
had
to
expect
the
page
containing
the
formula
was
gone
violet
now
saw
her
problem
ii
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
loss
i
have
mentioned
all
could
see
that
page
was
not
there
in
vain
a
second
handling
of
every
sheet
the
one
so
numbered
was
not
to
be
found
page
met
the
eye
on
the
top
of
the
pile
and
page
finished
it
off
at
the
bottom
but
no
page
in
between
or
anywhere
else
where
had
it
vanished
and
through
whose
agency
had
this
misadventure
occurred
no
one
could
say
or
at
least
no
one
there
made
any
attempt
to
do
so
though
everybody
started
to
look
for
it
but
where
look
the
adjoining
small
room
offered
no
facilities
for
hiding
a
much
less
a
square
of
shining
white
paper
bare
walls
a
bare
floor
and
a
single
chair
for
furniture
comprised
all
that
was
to
be
seen
in
this
direction
nor
could
the
room
in
which
they
then
stood
be
thought
to
hold
it
unless
it
was
on
the
person
of
some
one
of
them
could
this
be
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
no
man
looked
his
doubts
but
cornell
possibly
divining
the
general
feeling
stepped
up
to
van
broecklyn
and
in
a
cool
voice
but
with
the
red
burning
hotly
on
either
cheek
said
so
as
to
be
heard
by
everyone
present
i
demand
to
be
searched
at
once
and
a
moment
s
silence
then
the
common
cry
we
will
all
be
is
spielhagen
sure
that
the
missing
page
was
with
the
others
when
he
sat
down
in
the
adjoining
room
to
read
his
thesis
asked
their
perturbed
host
very
sure
came
the
emphatic
reply
indeed
i
was
just
going
through
the
formula
itself
when
i
fell
you
are
ready
to
assert
this
i
am
ready
to
swear
cornell
repeated
his
request
i
demand
that
you
make
a
thorough
search
of
my
person
i
must
be
cleared
and
instantly
of
every
suspicion
he
gravely
asserted
or
how
can
i
marry
miss
digby
after
that
there
was
no
further
hesitation
one
and
all
subjected
themselves
to
the
ordeal
suggested
even
spielhagen
but
this
effort
was
as
futile
as
the
rest
the
lost
page
was
not
found
what
were
they
to
think
what
were
they
to
do
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
left
to
do
and
yet
some
further
attempt
must
be
made
towards
the
recovery
of
this
important
formula
cornell
s
marriage
and
spielhagen
s
business
success
both
depended
upon
its
being
in
the
latter
s
hands
before
six
in
the
morning
when
he
was
engaged
to
hand
it
over
to
a
certain
manufacturer
sailing
for
europe
on
an
early
steamer
five
hours
had
van
broecklyn
a
suggestion
to
offer
no
he
was
as
much
at
sea
as
the
rest
simultaneously
look
crossed
look
blankness
was
on
every
face
let
us
call
the
ladies
suggested
one
it
was
done
and
however
great
the
tension
had
been
before
it
was
even
greater
when
miss
digby
stepped
upon
the
scene
but
she
was
not
a
woman
to
be
shaken
from
her
poise
even
by
a
crisis
of
this
importance
when
the
dilemma
had
been
presented
to
her
and
the
full
situation
grasped
she
looked
first
at
cornell
and
then
at
spielhagen
and
quietly
said
there
is
but
one
explanation
possible
of
this
matter
spielhagen
will
excuse
me
but
he
is
evidently
mistaken
in
thinking
that
he
saw
the
lost
page
among
the
rest
the
condition
into
which
he
was
thrown
by
the
unaccustomed
drug
he
had
drank
made
him
liable
to
hallucinations
i
have
not
the
least
doubt
he
thought
he
had
been
studying
the
formula
at
the
time
he
dropped
off
to
sleep
i
have
every
confidence
in
the
gentleman
s
candour
but
so
have
i
in
that
of
cornell
she
supplemented
with
a
smile
an
exclamation
from
van
broecklyn
and
a
subdued
murmur
from
all
but
spielhagen
testified
to
the
effect
of
this
suggestion
and
there
is
no
saying
what
might
have
been
the
result
if
cornell
had
not
hurriedly
put
in
this
extraordinary
and
most
unexpected
protest
miss
digby
has
my
gratitude
said
he
for
a
confidence
which
i
hope
to
prove
to
be
deserved
but
i
must
say
this
for
spielhagen
he
was
correct
in
stating
that
he
was
engaged
in
looking
over
his
formula
when
i
stepped
into
his
presence
with
the
glass
of
cordial
if
you
were
not
in
a
position
to
see
the
hurried
way
in
which
his
hand
instinctively
spread
itself
over
the
page
he
was
reading
i
was
and
if
that
does
not
seem
conclusive
to
you
then
i
feel
bound
to
state
that
in
unconsciously
following
this
movement
of
his
i
plainly
saw
the
number
written
on
the
top
of
the
page
and
that
number
was
a
loud
exclamation
this
time
from
spielhagen
himself
announced
his
gratitude
and
corresponding
change
of
attitude
toward
the
speaker
wherever
that
damned
page
has
gone
he
protested
advancing
towards
cornell
with
outstretched
hand
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
instantly
all
constraint
fled
and
every
countenance
took
on
a
relieved
expression
but
the
problem
remained
suddenly
those
very
words
passed
some
one
s
lips
and
with
their
utterance
upjohn
remembered
how
at
an
extraordinary
crisis
in
his
own
life
he
had
been
helped
and
an
equally
difficult
problem
settled
by
a
little
lady
secretly
attached
to
a
private
detective
agency
if
she
could
only
be
found
and
hurried
here
before
morning
all
might
yet
be
well
he
would
make
the
effort
such
wild
schemes
sometimes
work
he
telephoned
to
the
office
and
was
there
anything
else
miss
strange
would
like
to
know
iii
miss
strange
thus
appealed
to
asked
where
the
gentlemen
were
now
she
was
told
that
they
were
still
all
together
in
the
library
the
ladies
had
been
sent
home
then
let
us
go
to
them
said
violet
hiding
under
a
smile
her
great
fear
that
here
was
an
affair
which
might
very
easily
spell
for
her
that
dismal
word
failure
so
great
was
that
fear
that
under
all
ordinary
circumstances
she
would
have
had
no
thought
for
anything
else
in
the
short
interim
between
this
stating
of
the
problem
and
her
speedy
entrance
among
the
persons
involved
but
the
circumstances
of
this
case
were
so
far
from
ordinary
or
rather
let
me
put
it
in
this
way
the
setting
of
the
case
was
so
very
extraordinary
that
she
scarcely
thought
of
the
problem
before
her
in
her
great
interest
in
the
house
through
whose
rambling
halls
she
was
being
so
carefully
guided
so
much
that
was
tragic
and
heartrending
had
occurred
here
the
van
broecklyn
name
the
van
broecklyn
history
above
all
the
van
broecklyn
tradition
which
made
the
house
unique
in
the
country
s
annals
of
which
more
hereafter
all
made
an
appeal
to
her
imagination
and
centred
her
thoughts
on
what
she
saw
about
her
there
was
door
which
no
man
ever
opened
had
never
opened
since
revolutionary
times
should
she
see
it
should
she
know
it
if
she
did
see
it
then
van
broecklyn
himself
just
to
meet
him
under
any
conditions
and
in
any
place
was
an
event
but
to
meet
him
here
under
the
pall
of
his
own
mystery
no
wonder
she
had
no
words
for
her
companions
or
that
her
thoughts
clung
to
this
anticipation
in
wonder
and
almost
fearsome
delight
his
story
was
a
one
a
bachelor
and
a
misanthrope
he
lived
absolutely
alone
save
for
a
large
entourage
of
servants
all
men
and
elderly
ones
at
that
he
never
visited
though
he
now
and
then
as
on
this
occasion
entertained
certain
persons
under
his
roof
he
declined
every
invitation
for
himself
avoiding
even
with
equal
strictness
all
evening
amusements
of
whatever
kind
which
would
detain
him
in
the
city
after
ten
at
night
perhaps
this
was
to
ensure
no
break
in
his
rule
of
life
never
to
sleep
out
of
his
own
bed
though
he
was
a
man
well
over
fifty
he
had
not
spent
according
to
his
own
statement
but
two
nights
out
of
his
own
bed
since
his
return
from
europe
in
early
boyhood
and
those
were
in
obedience
to
a
judicial
summons
which
took
him
to
boston
this
was
his
main
eccentricity
but
he
had
another
which
is
apparent
enough
from
what
has
already
been
said
he
avoided
women
if
thrown
in
with
them
during
his
short
visits
into
town
he
was
invariably
polite
and
at
times
companionable
but
he
never
sought
them
out
nor
had
gossip
contrary
to
its
usual
habit
ever
linked
his
name
with
one
of
the
sex
yet
he
was
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
attraction
his
features
were
fine
and
his
figure
impressive
he
might
have
been
the
cynosure
of
all
eyes
had
he
chosen
to
enter
crowded
or
even
to
frequent
public
assemblages
but
having
turned
his
back
upon
everything
of
the
kind
in
his
youth
he
had
found
it
impossible
to
alter
his
habits
with
advancing
years
nor
was
he
now
expected
to
the
position
he
had
taken
was
respected
leonard
van
broecklyn
was
no
longer
criticized
was
there
any
explanation
for
this
strangely
life
those
who
knew
him
best
seemed
to
think
so
in
the
first
place
he
had
sprung
from
an
unfortunate
stock
events
of
unusual
and
tragic
nature
had
marked
the
family
of
both
parents
nor
had
his
parents
themselves
been
exempt
from
this
seeming
fatality
antagonistic
in
tastes
and
temperament
they
had
dragged
on
an
unhappy
existence
in
the
old
home
till
both
natures
rebelled
and
a
separation
ensued
which
not
only
disunited
their
lives
but
sent
them
to
opposite
sides
of
the
globe
never
to
return
again
at
least
that
was
the
inference
drawn
from
the
peculiar
circumstances
attending
the
event
on
the
morning
of
one
day
john
van
broecklyn
the
grandfather
of
the
present
representative
of
the
family
found
the
following
note
from
his
son
lying
on
the
library
table
father
life
in
this
house
or
any
house
with
her
is
no
longer
endurable
one
of
us
must
go
the
mother
should
not
be
separated
from
her
child
therefore
it
is
i
whom
you
will
never
see
again
forget
me
but
be
considerate
of
her
and
the
boy
six
hours
later
another
note
was
found
this
time
from
the
wife
father
tied
to
a
rotting
corpse
what
does
one
do
lop
off
one
s
arm
if
necessary
to
rid
one
of
the
contact
as
all
love
between
your
son
and
myself
is
dead
i
can
no
longer
live
within
the
sound
of
his
voice
as
this
is
his
home
he
is
the
one
to
remain
in
it
may
our
child
reap
the
benefit
of
his
mother
s
loss
and
his
father
s
affection
both
were
gone
and
gone
forever
simultaneous
in
their
departure
they
preserved
each
his
own
silence
and
sent
no
word
back
if
the
one
went
east
and
the
other
west
they
may
have
met
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
but
never
again
in
the
home
which
sheltered
their
boy
for
him
and
for
his
grandfather
they
had
sunk
from
sight
in
the
great
sea
of
humanity
leaving
them
stranded
on
an
isolated
and
mournful
shore
the
steeled
himself
to
the
double
loss
for
the
child
s
sake
but
the
boy
of
eleven
succumbed
few
of
the
world
s
great
sufferers
of
whatever
age
or
condition
have
mourned
as
this
child
mourned
or
shown
the
effects
of
his
grief
so
deeply
or
so
long
not
till
he
had
passed
his
majority
did
the
line
carved
in
one
day
in
his
baby
forehead
lose
any
of
its
intensity
and
there
are
those
who
declare
that
even
later
than
that
the
midnight
stillness
of
the
house
was
disturbed
from
time
to
time
by
his
muffled
shriek
of
mother
mother
sending
the
servants
from
the
house
and
adding
one
more
horror
to
the
many
which
clung
about
this
accursed
mansion
of
this
cry
violet
had
heard
and
it
was
that
and
the
door
but
i
have
already
told
you
about
the
door
which
she
was
still
looking
for
when
her
two
companions
suddenly
halted
and
she
found
herself
on
the
threshold
of
the
library
in
full
view
of
van
broecklyn
and
his
two
guests
slight
and
in
figure
with
an
air
of
modest
reserve
more
in
keeping
with
her
youth
and
dainty
dimpling
beauty
than
with
her
errand
her
appearance
produced
an
astonishment
none
of
which
the
gentlemen
were
able
to
disguise
this
the
clever
detective
with
a
genius
for
social
problems
and
odd
elusive
cases
this
darling
of
the
in
satin
and
pearls
spielhagen
glanced
at
cornell
and
cornell
at
spielhagen
and
both
at
upjohn
in
very
evident
distrust
as
for
violet
she
had
eyes
only
for
van
broecklyn
who
stood
before
her
in
a
surprise
equal
to
that
of
the
others
but
with
more
restraint
in
its
expression
she
was
not
disappointed
in
him
she
had
expected
to
see
a
man
reserved
almost
to
the
point
of
austerity
and
she
found
his
first
look
even
more
than
her
imagination
had
pictured
so
much
so
indeed
that
her
resolution
faltered
and
she
took
a
quick
step
backward
which
seeing
he
smiled
and
her
heart
and
hopes
grew
warm
again
that
he
could
smile
and
smile
with
absolute
sweetness
was
her
great
comfort
when
later
but
i
am
introducing
you
too
hurriedly
to
the
catastrophe
there
is
much
to
be
told
first
i
pass
over
the
preliminaries
and
come
at
once
to
the
moment
when
violet
having
listened
to
a
repetition
of
the
full
facts
stood
with
downcast
eyes
before
these
gentlemen
complaining
in
some
alarm
to
herself
they
expect
me
to
tell
them
now
and
without
further
search
or
parley
just
where
this
missing
page
is
i
shall
have
to
balk
that
expectation
without
losing
their
confidence
but
how
summoning
up
her
courage
and
meeting
each
inquiring
eye
with
a
look
which
seemed
to
carry
a
different
message
to
each
she
remarked
very
quietly
this
is
not
a
matter
to
guess
at
i
must
have
time
and
i
must
look
a
little
deeper
into
the
facts
just
given
me
i
presume
that
the
table
i
see
over
there
is
the
one
upon
which
upjohn
laid
the
manuscript
during
spielhagen
s
all
nodded
is
it
i
mean
the
table
in
the
same
condition
it
was
then
has
nothing
been
taken
from
it
except
the
manuscript
then
the
missing
page
is
not
there
she
smiled
pointing
to
its
bare
top
a
pause
during
which
she
stood
with
her
gaze
fixed
on
the
floor
before
her
she
was
thinking
and
thinking
hard
suddenly
she
came
to
a
decision
addressing
upjohn
she
asked
if
he
were
quite
sure
that
in
taking
the
manuscript
from
spielhagen
s
hand
he
had
neither
disarranged
nor
dropped
one
of
its
pages
the
answer
was
unequivocal
then
she
declared
with
quiet
assurance
and
a
steady
meeting
with
her
own
of
every
eye
as
the
thirteenth
page
was
not
found
among
the
others
when
they
were
taken
from
this
table
nor
on
the
persons
of
either
cornell
or
spielhagen
it
is
still
in
that
inner
impossible
came
from
every
lip
each
in
a
different
tone
that
room
is
absolutely
may
i
have
a
look
at
its
emptiness
she
asked
with
a
naive
glance
at
van
broecklyn
there
is
positively
nothing
in
the
room
but
the
chair
spielhagen
sat
on
objected
that
gentleman
with
a
noticeable
air
of
reluctance
still
may
i
not
have
a
look
at
it
she
persisted
with
that
disarming
smile
she
kept
for
great
occasions
van
broecklyn
bowed
he
could
not
refuse
a
request
so
urged
but
his
step
was
slow
and
his
manner
next
to
ungracious
as
he
led
the
way
to
the
door
of
the
adjoining
room
and
threw
it
open
just
what
she
had
been
told
to
expect
bare
walls
and
floors
and
an
empty
chair
yet
she
did
not
instantly
withdraw
but
stood
silently
contemplating
the
panelled
wainscoting
surrounding
her
as
though
she
suspected
it
of
containing
some
secret
not
apparent
to
the
eye
van
broecklyn
noting
this
hastened
to
say
the
walls
are
sound
miss
strange
they
contain
no
hidden
and
that
door
she
asked
pointing
to
a
portion
of
the
wainscoting
so
exactly
like
the
rest
that
only
the
most
experienced
eye
could
detect
the
line
of
deeper
colour
which
marked
an
opening
for
an
instant
van
broecklyn
stood
rigid
then
the
immovable
pallor
which
was
one
of
his
chief
characteristics
gave
way
to
a
deep
flush
as
he
explained
there
was
a
door
there
once
but
it
has
been
permanently
closed
with
cement
he
forced
himself
to
add
his
countenance
losing
its
evanescent
colour
till
it
shone
ghastly
again
in
the
strong
light
with
difficulty
violet
preserved
her
show
of
composure
the
door
she
murmured
to
herself
i
have
found
it
the
great
historic
door
but
her
tone
was
light
as
she
ventured
to
say
then
it
can
no
longer
be
opened
by
your
hand
or
any
other
it
could
not
be
opened
with
an
violet
sighed
in
the
midst
of
her
triumph
her
curiosity
had
been
satisfied
but
the
problem
she
had
been
set
to
solve
looked
inexplicable
but
she
was
not
one
to
yield
easily
to
discouragement
marking
the
disappointment
approaching
to
disdain
in
every
eye
but
upjohn
s
she
drew
herself
up
she
had
not
far
to
draw
and
made
this
final
proposal
a
sheet
of
paper
she
remarked
of
the
size
of
this
one
can
not
be
spirited
away
or
dissolved
into
thin
air
it
exists
it
is
here
and
all
we
want
is
some
happy
thought
in
order
to
find
it
i
acknowledge
that
that
happy
thought
has
not
come
to
me
yet
but
sometimes
i
get
it
in
what
may
seem
to
you
a
very
odd
way
forgetting
myself
i
try
to
assume
the
individuality
of
the
person
who
has
worked
the
mystery
if
i
can
think
with
his
thoughts
i
possibly
may
follow
him
in
his
actions
in
this
case
i
should
like
to
make
believe
for
a
few
moments
that
i
am
spielhagen
with
what
a
delicious
smile
she
said
this
i
should
like
to
hold
his
thesis
in
my
hand
and
be
interrupted
in
my
reading
by
cornell
offering
his
glass
of
cordial
then
i
should
like
to
nod
and
slip
off
mentally
into
a
deep
sleep
possibly
in
that
sleep
the
dream
may
come
which
will
clarify
the
whole
situation
will
you
humour
me
so
far
a
ridiculous
concession
but
finally
she
had
her
way
the
farce
was
enacted
and
they
left
her
as
she
had
requested
them
to
do
alone
with
her
dreams
in
the
small
room
suddenly
they
heard
her
cry
out
and
in
another
moment
she
appeared
before
them
the
picture
of
excitement
is
this
chair
standing
exactly
as
it
did
when
spielhagen
occupied
it
she
asked
no
said
upjohn
it
faced
the
other
she
stepped
back
and
twirled
the
chair
about
with
her
disengaged
hand
so
upjohn
and
spielhagen
both
nodded
so
did
the
others
when
she
glanced
at
them
with
a
sign
of
satisfaction
she
drew
their
attention
to
herself
then
eagerly
cried
gentlemen
look
here
seating
herself
she
allowed
her
whole
body
to
relax
till
she
presented
the
picture
of
one
calmly
asleep
then
as
they
continued
to
gaze
at
with
fascinated
eyes
not
knowing
what
to
expect
they
saw
something
white
escape
from
her
lap
and
slide
across
the
floor
till
it
touched
and
was
stayed
by
the
wainscot
it
was
the
top
page
of
the
manuscript
she
held
and
as
some
inkling
of
the
truth
reached
their
astonished
minds
she
sprang
impetuously
to
her
feet
and
pointing
to
the
fallen
sheet
cried
do
you
understand
now
look
where
it
lies
and
then
look
here
she
had
bounded
towards
the
wall
and
was
now
on
her
knees
pointing
to
the
bottom
of
the
wainscot
just
a
few
inches
to
the
left
of
the
fallen
page
a
crack
she
cried
under
what
was
once
the
door
it
s
a
very
thin
one
hardly
perceptible
to
the
eye
but
see
here
she
laid
her
finger
on
the
fallen
paper
and
drawing
it
towards
her
pushed
it
carefully
against
the
lower
edge
of
the
wainscot
half
of
it
at
once
disappeared
i
could
easily
slip
it
all
through
she
assured
them
withdrawing
the
sheet
and
leaping
to
her
feet
in
triumph
you
know
now
where
the
missing
page
lies
spielhagen
all
that
remains
is
for
van
broecklyn
to
get
it
for
iv
the
cries
of
mingled
astonishment
and
relief
which
greeted
this
simple
elucidation
of
the
mystery
were
broken
by
a
curiously
choked
almost
unintelligible
cry
it
came
from
the
man
thus
appealed
to
who
unnoticed
by
them
all
had
started
at
her
first
word
and
gradually
as
action
followed
action
withdrawn
himself
till
he
now
stood
alone
and
in
an
attitude
almost
of
defiance
behind
the
large
table
in
the
centre
of
the
library
i
am
sorry
he
began
with
a
brusqueness
which
gradually
toned
down
into
a
forced
urbanity
as
he
beheld
every
eye
fixed
upon
him
in
amazement
that
circumstances
forbid
my
being
of
assistance
to
you
in
this
unfortunate
matter
if
the
paper
lies
where
you
say
and
i
see
no
other
explanation
of
its
loss
i
am
afraid
it
will
have
to
remain
there
for
this
night
at
least
the
cement
in
which
that
door
is
embedded
is
thick
as
any
wall
it
would
take
men
with
pickaxes
possibly
with
dynamite
to
make
a
breach
there
wide
enough
for
any
one
to
reach
in
and
we
are
far
from
any
such
in
the
midst
of
the
consternation
caused
by
these
words
the
clock
on
the
mantel
behind
his
back
rang
out
the
hour
it
was
but
a
double
stroke
but
that
meant
two
hours
after
midnight
and
had
the
effect
of
a
knell
in
the
hearts
of
those
most
interested
but
i
am
expected
to
give
that
formula
into
the
hands
of
our
manager
before
six
o
clock
in
the
morning
the
steamer
sails
at
a
quarter
can
t
you
reproduce
a
copy
of
it
from
memory
some
one
asked
and
insert
it
in
its
proper
place
among
the
pages
you
hold
there
the
paper
would
not
be
the
same
that
would
lead
to
questions
and
the
truth
would
come
out
as
the
chief
value
of
the
process
contained
in
that
formula
lies
in
its
secrecy
no
explanation
i
could
give
would
relieve
me
from
the
suspicions
which
an
acknowledgment
of
the
existence
of
a
third
copy
however
well
hidden
would
entail
i
should
lose
my
great
cornell
s
state
of
mind
can
be
imagined
in
an
access
of
mingled
regret
and
despair
he
cast
a
glance
at
violet
who
with
a
nod
of
understanding
left
the
little
room
in
which
they
still
stood
and
approached
van
broecklyn
lifting
up
her
head
for
he
was
very
tall
and
instinctively
rising
on
her
toes
the
nearer
to
reach
his
ear
she
asked
in
a
cautious
whisper
is
there
no
other
way
of
reaching
that
place
she
acknowledged
afterwards
that
for
one
moment
her
heart
stood
still
from
fear
such
a
change
took
place
in
his
face
though
she
says
he
did
not
move
a
muscle
then
just
when
she
was
expecting
from
him
some
harsh
or
forbidding
word
he
wheeled
abruptly
away
from
her
and
crossing
to
a
window
at
his
side
lifted
the
shade
and
looked
out
when
he
returned
he
was
his
usual
self
so
far
as
she
could
see
there
is
a
way
he
now
confided
to
her
in
a
tone
as
low
as
her
own
but
it
can
only
be
taken
by
a
not
by
me
she
asked
smiling
down
at
her
own
childish
proportions
for
an
instant
he
seemed
taken
aback
then
she
saw
his
hand
begin
to
tremble
and
his
lips
twitch
somehow
she
knew
not
why
she
began
to
pity
him
and
asked
herself
as
she
felt
rather
than
saw
the
struggle
in
his
mind
that
here
was
a
trouble
which
if
once
understood
would
greatly
dwarf
that
of
the
two
men
in
the
room
behind
them
i
am
discreet
she
whisperingly
declared
i
have
heard
the
history
of
that
door
how
it
was
against
the
tradition
of
the
family
to
have
it
opened
there
must
have
been
some
very
dreadful
reason
but
old
superstitions
do
not
affect
me
and
if
you
will
allow
me
to
take
the
way
you
mention
i
will
follow
your
bidding
exactly
and
will
not
trouble
myself
about
anything
but
the
recovery
of
this
paper
which
must
lie
only
a
little
way
inside
that
was
his
look
one
of
rebuke
at
her
presumption
or
just
the
constrained
expression
of
a
perturbed
mind
probably
the
latter
for
while
she
watched
him
for
some
understanding
of
his
mood
he
reached
out
his
hand
and
touched
one
of
the
satin
folds
crossing
her
shoulder
you
would
soil
this
irretrievably
said
he
there
is
stuff
in
the
stores
for
another
she
smiled
slowly
his
touch
deepened
into
pressure
watching
him
she
saw
the
crust
of
some
old
fear
or
dominant
superstition
melt
under
her
eyes
and
was
quite
prepared
when
he
remarked
with
what
for
him
was
a
lightsome
air
i
will
buy
the
stuff
if
you
will
dare
the
darkness
and
intricacies
of
our
old
cellar
i
can
give
you
no
light
you
will
have
to
feel
your
way
according
to
my
i
am
ready
to
dare
he
left
her
abruptly
i
will
warn
miss
digby
he
called
back
she
shall
go
with
you
as
far
as
the
v
violet
in
her
short
career
as
an
investigator
of
mysteries
had
been
in
many
a
situation
calling
for
more
than
womanly
nerve
and
courage
but
never
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
at
the
time
had
she
experienced
a
greater
depression
of
spirit
than
when
she
stood
with
miss
digby
before
a
small
door
at
the
extreme
end
of
the
cellar
and
understood
that
here
was
her
road
a
road
which
once
entered
she
must
take
alone
first
it
was
such
a
small
door
no
child
older
than
eleven
could
possibly
squeeze
through
it
but
she
was
of
the
size
of
a
child
of
eleven
and
might
possibly
manage
that
difficulty
secondly
there
are
always
some
unforeseen
possibilities
in
every
situation
and
though
she
had
listened
carefully
to
van
broecklyn
s
directions
and
was
sure
that
she
knew
them
by
heart
she
wished
she
had
kissed
her
father
more
tenderly
in
leaving
him
that
night
for
the
ball
and
that
she
had
not
pouted
so
undutifully
at
some
harsh
stricture
he
had
made
did
this
mean
fear
she
despised
the
feeling
if
it
did
thirdly
she
hated
darkness
she
knew
this
when
she
offered
herself
for
this
undertaking
but
she
was
in
a
bright
room
at
the
moment
and
only
imagined
what
she
must
now
face
as
a
reality
but
one
jet
had
been
lit
in
the
cellar
and
that
near
the
entrance
van
broecklyn
seemed
not
to
need
light
even
in
his
unfastening
of
the
small
door
which
violet
was
sure
had
been
protected
by
more
than
one
lock
doubt
shadow
and
a
solitary
climb
between
unknown
walls
with
only
a
streak
of
light
for
her
goal
and
the
clinging
pressure
of
florence
digby
s
hand
on
her
own
for
solace
surely
the
prospect
was
one
to
tax
the
courage
of
her
young
heart
to
its
limit
but
she
had
promised
and
she
would
fulfill
so
with
a
brave
smile
she
stooped
to
the
little
door
and
in
another
moment
had
started
her
journey
for
journey
the
shortest
distance
may
seem
when
every
inch
means
a
and
one
grows
old
in
traversing
a
foot
at
first
the
way
was
easy
she
had
but
to
crawl
up
a
slight
incline
with
the
comforting
consciousness
that
two
people
were
within
reach
of
her
voice
almost
within
sound
of
her
beating
heart
but
presently
she
came
to
a
turn
beyond
which
her
fingers
failed
to
reach
any
wall
on
her
left
then
came
a
step
up
which
she
stumbled
and
farther
on
a
short
flight
each
tread
of
which
she
had
been
told
to
test
before
she
ventured
to
climb
it
lest
the
decay
of
innumerable
years
should
have
weakened
the
wood
too
much
to
bear
her
weight
one
two
three
four
five
steps
then
a
landing
with
an
open
space
beyond
half
of
her
journey
was
done
here
she
felt
she
could
give
a
minute
to
drawing
her
breath
naturally
if
the
air
unchanged
in
years
would
allow
her
to
do
so
besides
here
she
had
been
enjoined
to
do
a
certain
thing
and
to
do
it
according
to
instructions
three
matches
had
been
given
her
and
a
little
night
candle
denied
all
light
up
to
now
it
was
at
this
point
she
was
to
light
her
candle
and
place
it
on
the
floor
so
that
in
returning
she
should
not
miss
the
staircase
and
get
a
fall
she
had
promised
to
do
this
and
was
only
too
happy
to
see
a
spark
of
light
scintillate
into
life
in
the
immeasurable
darkness
she
was
now
in
a
great
room
long
closed
to
the
world
where
once
officers
in
colonial
wars
had
feasted
and
more
than
one
council
had
been
held
a
room
too
which
had
seen
more
than
one
tragic
happening
as
its
almost
unparalleled
isolation
proclaimed
so
much
van
broecklyn
had
told
her
but
she
was
warned
to
be
careful
in
traversing
it
and
not
upon
any
pretext
to
swerve
aside
from
the
wall
till
she
came
to
a
huge
mantelpiece
this
passed
and
a
sharp
corner
turned
she
ought
to
see
somewhere
in
the
dim
spaces
before
her
a
streak
of
vivid
light
shining
through
the
crack
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
the
paper
should
be
somewhere
near
this
streak
all
simple
all
easy
of
accomplishment
if
only
that
streak
of
light
were
all
she
was
likely
to
see
or
think
of
if
the
horror
which
was
gripping
her
throat
should
not
take
shape
if
things
would
remain
shrouded
in
impenetrable
darkness
and
not
force
themselves
in
shadowy
suggestion
upon
her
excited
fancy
but
the
blackness
of
the
through
which
she
had
just
struggled
was
not
to
be
found
here
whether
it
was
the
effect
of
that
small
flame
flickering
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
behind
her
or
of
some
change
in
her
own
powers
of
seeing
surely
there
was
a
difference
in
her
present
outlook
tall
shapes
were
becoming
visible
the
air
was
no
longer
blank
she
could
see
then
suddenly
she
saw
why
in
the
wall
high
up
on
her
right
was
a
window
it
was
small
and
all
but
invisible
being
covered
on
the
outside
with
vines
and
on
the
inside
with
the
cobwebs
of
a
century
but
some
small
gleams
from
the
night
came
through
making
phantasms
out
of
ordinary
things
which
unseen
were
horrible
enough
and
half
seen
choked
her
heart
with
terror
i
can
not
bear
it
she
whispered
to
herself
even
while
creeping
forward
her
hand
upon
the
wall
i
will
close
my
eyes
was
her
next
thought
i
will
make
my
own
darkness
and
with
a
spasmodic
forcing
of
her
lids
together
she
continued
to
creep
on
passing
the
mantelpiece
where
she
knocked
against
something
which
fell
with
an
awful
clatter
this
sound
followed
as
it
was
by
that
of
smothered
voices
from
the
excited
group
awaiting
the
result
of
her
experiment
from
behind
the
impenetrable
wall
she
should
be
nearing
now
if
she
had
followed
her
instructions
aright
freed
her
instantly
from
her
fancies
and
opening
her
eyes
once
more
she
cast
a
look
ahead
and
to
her
delight
saw
but
a
few
steps
away
the
thin
streak
of
bright
light
which
marked
the
end
of
her
journey
it
took
her
but
a
moment
after
that
to
find
the
missing
page
and
picking
it
up
in
haste
from
the
dusty
floor
she
turned
herself
quickly
about
and
joyfully
began
to
retrace
her
steps
why
then
was
it
that
in
the
course
of
a
few
minutes
more
her
voice
suddenly
broke
into
a
wild
unearthly
shriek
which
ringing
with
terror
burst
the
bounds
of
that
room
and
sank
a
barbed
shaft
into
the
breasts
of
those
awaiting
the
result
of
her
doubtful
adventure
at
either
end
of
this
dread
what
had
happened
if
they
had
thought
to
look
out
they
would
have
seen
that
the
moon
held
in
check
by
a
bank
of
cloud
occupying
half
the
heavens
had
suddenly
burst
its
bounds
and
was
sending
long
bars
of
revealing
light
into
every
uncurtained
window
vi
florence
digby
in
her
short
and
sheltered
life
had
possibly
never
known
any
very
great
or
deep
emotion
but
she
touched
the
bottom
of
extreme
terror
at
that
moment
as
with
her
ears
still
thrilling
with
violet
s
piercing
cry
she
turned
to
look
at
van
broecklyn
and
beheld
the
instantaneous
wreck
it
had
made
of
this
seemingly
strong
man
not
till
he
came
to
lie
in
his
coffin
would
he
show
a
more
ghastly
countenance
and
trembling
herself
almost
to
the
point
of
falling
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
sought
to
read
his
face
what
had
happened
something
disastrous
she
was
sure
something
which
he
had
feared
and
was
partially
prepared
for
yet
which
in
happening
had
crushed
him
was
it
a
pitfall
into
which
the
poor
little
lady
had
fallen
if
so
but
he
is
speaking
mumbling
low
words
to
himself
some
of
them
she
can
hear
he
is
reproaching
himself
repeating
over
and
over
that
he
should
never
have
taken
such
a
chance
that
he
should
have
remembered
her
youth
the
weakness
of
a
young
girl
s
nerve
he
had
been
mad
and
now
and
now
with
the
repetition
of
this
word
his
murmuring
ceased
all
his
energies
were
now
absorbed
in
listening
at
the
low
door
separating
him
from
what
he
was
agonizing
to
know
a
door
impossible
to
enter
impossible
to
enlarge
a
barrier
to
all
help
an
opening
whereby
sound
might
pass
but
nothing
else
save
her
own
small
body
now
lying
where
is
she
hurt
faltered
florence
stooping
herself
to
listen
can
you
hear
anything
anything
for
an
instant
he
did
not
answer
every
faculty
was
absorbed
in
the
one
sense
then
slowly
and
in
gasps
he
began
to
mutter
i
think
i
hear
something
her
step
no
no
no
step
all
is
as
quiet
as
death
not
a
sound
not
a
breath
she
has
fainted
o
god
o
god
why
this
calamity
on
top
of
all
he
had
sprung
to
his
feet
at
the
utterance
this
invocation
but
next
moment
was
down
on
knees
again
listening
listening
never
was
silence
more
profound
they
were
hearkening
for
murmurs
from
a
tomb
florence
began
to
sense
the
full
horror
of
it
all
and
was
swaying
helplessly
when
van
broecklyn
impulsively
lifted
his
hand
in
an
admonitory
hush
and
through
the
daze
of
her
faculties
a
small
far
sound
began
to
make
itself
heard
growing
louder
as
she
waited
then
becoming
faint
again
then
altogether
ceasing
only
to
renew
itself
once
more
till
it
resolved
into
an
approaching
step
faltering
in
its
course
but
coming
ever
nearer
and
nearer
she
s
safe
she
s
not
hurt
sprang
from
florence
s
lips
in
inexpressible
relief
and
expecting
van
broecklyn
to
show
an
equal
joy
she
turned
towards
him
with
the
cheerful
cry
now
if
she
has
been
so
fortunate
as
to
that
missing
page
we
shall
all
be
repaid
for
our
a
movement
on
his
part
a
shifting
of
position
which
brought
him
finally
to
his
feet
but
he
gave
no
other
proof
of
having
heard
her
nor
did
his
countenance
mirror
her
relief
it
is
as
if
he
dreaded
instead
of
hailed
her
return
was
florence
s
inward
comment
as
she
watched
him
involuntarily
recoil
at
each
fresh
token
of
violet
s
advance
yet
because
this
seemed
so
very
unnatural
she
persisted
in
her
efforts
to
lighten
the
situation
and
when
he
made
no
attempt
to
encourage
violet
in
her
approach
she
herself
stooped
and
called
out
a
cheerful
welcome
which
must
have
rung
sweetly
in
the
poor
little
detective
s
ears
a
sorry
sight
was
violet
when
helped
by
florence
she
finally
crawled
into
view
through
the
narrow
opening
and
stood
once
again
on
the
cellar
floor
pale
trembling
and
soiled
with
the
dust
of
years
she
presented
a
helpless
figure
enough
till
the
joy
in
florence
s
face
recalled
some
of
her
spirit
and
glancing
down
at
her
hand
in
which
a
sheet
of
paper
was
visible
she
asked
for
spielhagen
i
ve
got
the
formula
she
said
if
you
will
bring
him
i
will
hand
it
over
to
him
not
a
word
of
her
adventure
nor
so
much
as
one
glance
at
van
broecklyn
standing
far
back
in
the
shadows
nor
was
she
more
communicative
when
the
formula
restored
and
everything
made
right
with
spielhagen
they
all
came
together
again
in
the
library
for
a
final
word
i
was
frightened
by
the
silence
and
the
darkness
and
so
cried
out
she
explained
in
answer
to
their
questions
any
one
would
have
done
so
who
found
himself
alone
in
so
musty
a
place
she
added
with
an
attempt
at
lightsomeness
which
deepened
the
pallor
on
van
broecklyn
s
cheek
already
sufficiently
noticeable
to
have
been
remarked
upon
by
more
than
one
no
ghosts
laughed
cornell
too
happy
in
the
return
of
his
hopes
to
be
fully
sensible
of
the
feelings
of
those
about
him
no
whispers
from
impalpable
lips
or
touches
from
spectre
hands
nothing
to
explain
the
mystery
of
that
room
long
shut
up
that
even
van
broecklyn
declares
himself
ignorant
of
its
secret
nothing
returned
violet
showing
her
dimples
in
full
force
now
if
miss
strange
had
any
such
experiences
if
she
has
anything
to
tell
worthy
of
so
marked
a
curiosity
she
will
tell
it
now
came
from
the
gentleman
just
alluded
to
in
tones
so
stern
and
strange
that
all
show
of
frivolity
ceased
on
the
instant
have
you
anything
to
tell
miss
strange
greatly
startled
she
regarded
him
with
widening
eyes
for
a
moment
then
with
a
move
towards
the
door
remarked
with
a
general
look
about
her
mr
van
broecklyn
knows
his
own
house
and
doubtless
can
relate
its
histories
if
he
will
i
am
a
busy
little
body
who
having
finished
my
work
am
now
ready
to
return
home
there
to
wait
for
the
next
problem
which
an
indulgent
fate
may
offer
she
was
near
the
threshold
she
was
about
to
take
her
leave
when
suddenly
she
felt
two
hands
fall
on
her
shoulder
and
turning
met
the
eyes
of
van
broecklyn
burning
into
her
own
you
saw
dropped
in
an
almost
inaudible
whisper
from
his
lips
the
shiver
which
shook
her
answered
him
better
than
any
word
with
an
exclamation
of
despair
he
withdrew
his
hands
and
facing
the
others
now
standing
together
in
a
startled
group
he
said
as
soon
as
he
could
recover
some
of
his
i
must
ask
for
another
hour
of
your
company
i
can
no
longer
keep
my
sorrow
to
myself
a
dividing
line
has
just
been
drawn
across
my
life
and
i
must
have
the
sympathy
of
someone
who
knows
my
past
or
i
shall
go
mad
in
my
solitude
come
back
miss
strange
you
of
all
others
have
the
prior
right
to
vii
i
shall
have
to
begin
said
he
when
they
were
all
seated
and
ready
to
listen
by
giving
you
some
idea
not
so
much
of
the
family
tradition
as
of
the
effect
of
this
tradition
upon
all
who
bore
the
name
of
van
broecklyn
this
is
not
the
only
house
even
in
america
which
contains
a
room
shut
away
from
intrusion
in
england
there
are
many
but
there
is
this
difference
between
most
of
them
and
ours
no
bars
or
locks
forcibly
held
shut
the
door
we
were
forbidden
to
open
the
command
was
enough
that
and
the
superstitious
fear
which
such
a
command
attended
by
a
long
and
unquestioning
obedience
was
likely
to
engender
i
know
no
more
than
you
do
why
some
early
ancestor
laid
his
ban
upon
this
room
but
from
my
earliest
years
i
was
given
to
understand
that
there
was
one
latch
in
the
house
which
was
never
to
be
lifted
that
any
fault
would
be
forgiven
sooner
than
that
that
the
honour
of
the
whole
family
stood
in
the
way
of
disobedience
and
that
i
was
to
preserve
that
honour
to
my
dying
day
you
will
say
that
all
this
is
fantastic
and
wonder
that
sane
people
in
these
modern
times
should
subject
themselves
to
such
a
ridiculous
restriction
especially
when
no
good
reason
was
alleged
and
the
very
source
of
the
tradition
from
which
it
sprung
forgotten
you
are
right
but
if
you
look
long
into
human
nature
you
will
see
that
the
bonds
which
hold
the
firmest
are
not
material
ones
that
an
idea
will
make
a
man
and
mould
a
character
that
it
lies
at
the
source
of
all
heroisms
and
is
to
be
courted
or
feared
as
the
case
may
be
for
me
it
possessed
a
power
proportionate
to
my
loneliness
i
don
t
think
there
was
ever
a
more
lonely
child
my
father
and
mother
were
so
unhappy
in
each
other
s
companionship
that
one
or
other
of
them
was
almost
always
away
but
i
saw
little
of
either
even
when
they
were
at
home
the
constraint
in
their
attitude
towards
each
other
affected
their
conduct
towards
me
i
have
asked
myself
more
than
once
if
either
of
them
had
any
real
affection
for
me
to
my
father
i
spoke
of
her
to
her
of
him
and
never
pleasurably
this
i
am
forced
to
say
or
you
can
not
understand
my
story
would
to
god
i
could
tell
another
tale
would
to
god
i
had
such
memories
as
other
men
have
of
a
father
s
clasp
a
mother
s
kiss
but
no
my
grief
already
profound
might
have
become
abysmal
perhaps
it
is
best
as
it
is
only
i
might
have
been
a
different
child
and
made
for
myself
a
different
fate
who
knows
as
it
was
i
was
thrown
almost
entirely
upon
my
own
resources
for
any
amusement
this
led
me
to
a
discovery
i
made
one
day
in
a
far
part
of
the
cellar
behind
some
heavy
casks
i
found
a
little
door
it
was
so
low
so
exactly
fitted
to
my
small
body
that
i
had
the
greatest
desire
to
enter
it
but
i
could
not
get
around
the
casks
at
last
an
expedient
occurred
to
me
we
had
an
old
servant
who
came
nearer
loving
me
than
any
one
else
one
day
when
i
chanced
to
be
alone
in
the
cellar
i
took
out
my
ball
and
began
throwing
it
about
finally
it
landed
behind
the
casks
and
i
ran
with
a
beseeching
cry
to
michael
to
move
them
it
was
a
task
requiring
no
little
strength
and
address
but
he
managed
after
a
few
herculean
efforts
to
shift
them
aside
and
i
saw
with
delight
my
way
opened
to
that
mysterious
little
door
but
i
did
not
approach
it
then
some
instinct
deterred
me
but
when
the
opportunity
came
for
me
to
venture
there
alone
i
did
so
in
the
most
adventurous
spirit
and
began
my
operations
by
sliding
behind
the
casks
and
testing
the
handle
of
the
little
door
it
turned
and
after
a
pull
or
two
the
door
yielded
with
my
heart
in
my
mouth
i
stooped
and
peered
in
i
could
see
nothing
a
black
hole
and
nothing
more
this
caused
me
a
moment
s
hesitation
i
was
afraid
of
the
dark
had
always
been
but
curiosity
and
the
spirit
of
adventure
triumphed
saying
to
myself
that
i
was
robinson
crusoe
exploring
the
cave
i
crawled
in
only
to
find
that
i
had
gained
nothing
it
was
as
dark
inside
as
it
had
looked
to
be
from
without
there
was
no
fun
in
this
so
i
crawled
back
and
when
i
tried
the
experiment
again
it
was
with
a
bit
of
candle
in
my
hand
and
a
surreptitious
match
or
two
what
i
saw
when
with
a
very
trembling
little
hand
i
had
lighted
one
of
the
matches
would
have
been
disappointing
to
most
boys
but
not
to
me
the
litter
and
old
boards
i
saw
in
odd
corners
about
me
were
full
of
possibilities
while
in
the
dimness
beyond
i
seemed
to
perceive
a
sort
of
staircase
which
might
lead
i
do
not
think
i
made
any
attempt
to
answer
that
question
even
in
my
own
mind
but
when
after
some
hesitation
and
a
sense
of
great
daring
i
finally
crept
up
those
steps
i
remember
very
well
my
sensation
at
finding
myself
in
front
of
a
narrow
closed
door
it
suggested
too
vividly
the
one
in
grandfather
s
little
room
the
door
in
the
wainscot
which
we
were
never
to
open
i
had
my
first
real
trembling
fit
here
and
at
once
fascinated
and
repelled
by
this
obstruction
i
stumbled
and
lost
my
candle
which
going
out
in
the
fall
left
me
in
total
darkness
and
a
very
frightened
state
of
mind
for
my
imagination
which
had
been
greatly
stirred
by
my
own
vague
thoughts
of
the
forbidden
room
immediately
began
to
people
the
space
about
me
with
ghoulish
figures
how
should
i
escape
them
how
ever
reach
my
own
little
room
again
undetected
and
in
safety
but
these
terrors
deep
as
they
were
were
nothing
to
the
real
fright
which
seized
me
when
the
darkness
finally
braved
and
the
way
found
back
into
the
bright
halls
of
the
house
i
became
conscious
of
having
dropped
something
besides
the
candle
my
was
gone
not
my
but
my
grandfather
s
which
i
had
found
lying
on
his
table
and
carried
off
on
this
adventure
in
all
the
confidence
of
irresponsible
youth
to
make
use
of
it
for
a
little
while
trusting
to
his
not
missing
it
in
the
confusion
i
had
noticed
about
the
house
that
morning
was
one
thing
to
lose
it
was
another
it
was
no
common
box
made
of
gold
and
cherished
for
some
special
reason
well
known
to
himself
i
had
often
hear
him
say
that
some
day
i
would
appreciate
its
value
and
be
glad
to
own
it
and
i
had
left
it
in
that
hole
and
at
any
minute
he
might
miss
it
possibly
ask
for
it
the
day
was
one
of
torment
my
mother
was
away
or
shut
up
in
her
room
my
father
i
don
t
know
just
what
thoughts
i
had
about
him
he
was
not
to
be
seen
either
and
the
servants
cast
strange
looks
at
me
when
i
spoke
his
name
but
i
little
realized
the
blow
which
had
just
fallen
upon
the
house
in
his
definite
departure
and
only
thought
of
my
own
trouble
and
of
how
i
should
meet
my
grandfather
s
eye
when
the
hour
came
for
him
to
draw
me
to
his
knee
for
his
usual
that
i
was
spared
this
ordeal
for
the
first
time
this
very
night
first
comforted
me
then
added
to
my
distress
he
had
discovered
his
loss
and
was
angry
on
the
morrow
he
would
ask
me
for
the
box
and
i
would
have
to
lie
for
never
could
i
find
the
courage
to
tell
him
where
i
had
been
such
an
act
of
presumption
he
would
never
forgive
or
so
i
thought
as
i
lay
and
shivered
in
my
little
bed
that
his
coldness
his
neglect
sprang
from
the
discovery
just
made
that
my
mother
as
well
as
my
father
had
just
fled
the
house
forever
was
as
little
known
to
me
as
the
morning
calamity
i
had
been
given
my
usual
tendance
and
was
tucked
safely
into
bed
but
the
gloom
the
silence
which
presently
settled
upon
the
house
had
a
very
different
explanation
in
my
mind
from
the
real
one
my
sin
for
such
it
loomed
large
in
my
mind
by
this
time
coloured
the
whole
situation
and
accounted
for
every
event
at
what
hour
i
slipped
from
my
bed
on
to
the
cold
floor
i
shall
never
know
to
me
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
dead
of
night
but
i
doubt
if
it
were
more
than
ten
so
slowly
creep
away
the
moments
to
a
wakeful
child
i
had
made
a
great
resolve
awful
as
the
prospect
seemed
to
me
frightened
as
i
was
by
the
very
thought
i
had
determined
in
my
small
mind
to
go
down
into
the
cellar
and
into
that
midnight
hole
again
in
search
of
the
lost
box
i
would
take
a
candle
and
matches
this
time
from
my
own
and
if
everyone
was
asleep
as
appeared
from
the
deathly
quiet
of
the
house
i
would
be
able
to
go
and
come
without
anybody
ever
being
the
wiser
dressing
in
the
dark
i
found
my
matches
and
my
candle
and
putting
them
in
one
of
my
pockets
softly
opened
my
door
and
looked
out
nobody
was
stirring
every
light
was
out
except
a
solitary
one
in
the
lower
hall
that
this
still
burned
conveyed
no
meaning
to
my
mind
how
could
i
know
that
the
house
was
so
still
and
the
rooms
dark
because
everyone
was
out
searching
for
some
clue
to
my
mother
s
flight
if
i
had
looked
at
the
clock
but
i
did
not
i
was
too
intent
upon
my
errand
too
filled
with
the
fever
of
my
desperate
undertaking
to
be
affected
by
anything
not
bearing
directly
upon
it
of
the
terror
caused
by
my
own
shadow
on
the
wall
as
i
made
the
turn
in
the
hall
below
i
have
as
keen
a
recollection
today
as
though
it
happened
yesterday
but
that
did
not
deter
me
nothing
deterred
me
till
safe
in
the
cellar
i
crouched
down
behind
the
casks
to
get
my
breath
again
before
entering
the
hole
beyond
i
had
made
some
noise
in
feeling
my
way
around
these
casks
and
i
trembled
lest
these
sounds
had
been
heard
upstairs
but
this
fear
soon
gave
place
to
one
far
greater
other
sounds
were
making
themselves
heard
a
din
of
small
skurrying
feet
above
below
on
every
side
of
me
rats
rats
in
the
wall
rats
on
the
cellar
bottom
how
i
ever
stirred
from
the
spot
i
do
not
know
but
when
i
did
stir
it
was
to
go
forward
and
enter
the
uncanny
hole
i
had
intended
to
light
my
candle
when
i
got
inside
but
for
some
reason
i
went
stumbling
along
in
the
dark
following
the
wall
till
i
got
to
the
steps
where
i
had
dropped
the
box
here
a
light
was
necessary
but
my
hand
did
not
go
to
my
pocket
i
thought
it
better
to
climb
the
steps
first
and
softly
one
foot
found
the
tread
and
then
another
i
had
only
three
more
to
climb
and
then
my
right
hand
now
feeling
its
way
along
the
wall
would
be
free
to
strike
a
match
i
climbed
the
three
steps
and
was
steadying
myself
against
the
door
for
a
final
plunge
when
something
happened
something
so
strange
so
unexpected
and
so
incredible
that
i
wonder
i
did
not
shriek
aloud
in
my
terror
the
door
was
moving
under
my
hand
it
was
slowly
opening
inward
i
could
feel
the
chill
made
by
the
widening
crack
moment
by
moment
this
chill
increased
the
gap
was
growing
a
presence
was
there
a
presence
before
which
i
sank
in
a
small
heap
upon
the
landing
would
it
advance
had
it
feet
hands
was
it
a
presence
which
could
be
felt
whatever
it
was
it
made
no
attempt
to
pass
and
presently
i
lifted
my
head
only
to
quake
anew
at
the
sound
of
a
voice
a
human
voice
my
mother
s
voice
so
near
me
that
by
putting
out
my
arms
i
might
have
touched
her
she
was
speaking
to
my
father
i
knew
from
the
tone
she
was
saying
words
which
little
understood
as
they
were
made
such
a
havoc
in
my
youthful
mind
that
i
have
never
forgotten
the
effect
i
have
come
she
said
they
think
i
have
fled
the
house
and
are
looking
far
and
wide
for
me
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
who
would
think
looking
of
here
for
either
you
or
here
the
word
sank
like
a
plummet
in
my
breast
i
had
known
for
some
few
minutes
that
i
was
on
the
threshold
of
the
forbidden
room
but
they
were
in
it
i
can
scarcely
make
you
understand
the
tumult
which
this
awoke
in
my
brain
somehow
i
had
never
thought
that
any
such
braving
of
the
house
s
law
would
be
possible
i
heard
my
father
s
answer
but
it
conveyed
no
meaning
to
me
i
also
realized
that
he
spoke
from
a
distance
that
he
was
at
one
end
of
the
room
while
we
were
at
the
other
i
was
presently
to
have
this
idea
confirmed
for
while
i
was
striving
with
all
my
might
and
main
to
subdue
my
very
so
that
she
would
not
hear
me
or
suspect
my
presence
the
darkness
i
should
rather
say
the
blackness
of
the
place
yielded
to
a
flash
of
lightning
heat
lightning
all
glare
and
no
sound
and
i
caught
an
instantaneous
vision
of
my
father
s
figure
standing
with
gleaming
things
about
him
which
affected
me
at
the
moment
as
supernatural
but
which
in
later
years
i
decided
to
have
been
weapons
hanging
on
a
wall
she
saw
him
too
for
she
gave
a
quick
laugh
and
said
they
would
not
need
any
candles
and
then
there
was
another
flash
and
i
saw
something
in
his
hand
and
something
in
hers
and
though
i
did
not
yet
understand
i
felt
myself
turning
deathly
sick
and
gave
a
choking
gasp
which
was
lost
in
the
rush
she
made
into
the
centre
of
the
room
and
the
keenness
of
her
swift
low
cry
for
only
one
of
us
will
ever
leave
this
room
alive
a
duel
a
duel
to
the
death
between
this
husband
and
wife
this
father
and
mother
in
this
hole
of
dead
tragedies
and
within
the
sight
and
hearing
of
their
child
has
satan
ever
devised
a
scheme
more
hideous
for
ruining
the
life
of
an
boy
not
that
i
took
it
all
in
at
once
i
was
too
innocent
and
much
too
dazed
to
comprehend
such
hatred
much
less
the
passions
which
engender
it
i
only
knew
that
something
horrible
something
beyond
the
conception
of
my
childish
mind
was
going
to
take
place
in
the
darkness
before
me
and
the
terror
of
it
made
me
speechless
would
to
god
it
had
made
me
deaf
and
blind
and
dead
she
had
dashed
from
her
corner
and
he
had
slid
away
from
his
as
the
next
fantastic
glare
which
lit
up
the
room
showed
me
it
also
showed
the
weapons
in
their
hands
and
for
a
moment
i
felt
reassured
when
i
saw
that
these
were
swords
for
i
had
seen
them
before
with
foils
in
their
hands
practising
for
exercise
as
they
said
in
the
great
garret
but
the
swords
had
buttons
on
them
and
this
time
the
tips
were
sharp
and
shone
in
the
keen
light
an
exclamation
from
her
and
a
growl
of
rage
from
him
were
followed
by
movements
i
could
scarcely
hear
but
which
were
terrifying
from
their
very
quiet
then
the
sound
of
a
clash
the
swords
had
crossed
had
the
lightning
flashed
forth
then
the
end
of
one
of
them
might
have
occurred
but
the
darkness
remained
undisturbed
and
when
the
glare
relit
the
great
room
again
they
were
already
far
apart
this
called
out
a
word
from
him
the
one
sentence
he
spoke
i
can
never
forget
it
rhoda
there
is
blood
on
your
sleeve
i
have
wounded
you
shall
we
call
it
off
and
fly
as
the
poor
creatures
in
there
think
we
have
to
the
opposite
ends
of
the
earth
i
almost
spoke
i
almost
added
my
childish
plea
to
his
for
them
to
stop
to
remember
me
and
stop
but
not
a
muscle
in
my
throat
responded
to
my
agonized
effort
her
cold
clear
no
fell
before
my
tongue
was
loosed
or
my
heart
freed
from
the
ponderous
weight
crushing
it
i
have
vowed
and
i
keep
my
promises
she
went
on
in
a
tone
quite
strange
to
me
what
would
either
s
life
be
worth
with
the
other
alive
and
happy
in
this
he
made
no
answer
and
those
subtle
movements
shadows
of
movements
i
might
almost
call
them
recommenced
then
there
came
a
sudden
cry
shrill
and
poignant
had
grandfather
been
in
his
room
he
would
surely
have
heard
it
and
the
flash
coming
almost
simultaneously
with
its
utterance
i
saw
what
has
haunted
my
sleep
from
that
day
to
this
my
father
pinned
against
the
wall
sword
still
in
hand
and
before
him
my
mother
fiercely
triumphant
her
staring
eyes
fixed
on
his
and
nature
could
bear
no
more
the
band
loosened
from
my
throat
the
oppression
lifted
from
my
breast
long
enough
for
me
to
give
one
wild
wail
and
she
turned
saw
heaven
sent
its
flashes
quickly
at
this
moment
and
recognizing
my
childish
form
all
the
horror
of
her
deed
or
so
i
have
fondly
hoped
rose
within
her
and
she
gave
a
start
and
fell
full
upon
the
point
upturned
to
receive
her
a
groan
then
a
gasping
sigh
from
him
and
silence
settled
upon
the
room
and
upon
my
heart
and
so
far
as
i
knew
upon
the
whole
created
world
that
is
my
story
friends
do
you
wonder
that
i
have
never
been
or
lived
like
other
men
after
a
few
moments
of
sympathetic
silence
van
broecklyn
went
on
to
say
i
don
t
think
i
ever
had
a
moment
s
doubt
that
my
parents
both
lay
dead
on
the
floor
of
that
great
room
when
i
came
to
myself
which
may
have
been
soon
and
may
not
have
been
for
a
long
while
the
lightning
had
ceased
to
flash
leaving
the
darkness
stretching
like
a
blank
pall
between
me
and
that
spot
in
which
were
concentrated
all
the
terrors
of
which
my
imagination
was
capable
i
dared
not
enter
it
i
dared
not
take
one
step
that
way
my
instinct
was
to
fly
and
hide
my
trembling
body
again
in
my
own
bed
and
associated
with
this
in
fact
dominating
it
and
making
me
old
before
my
time
was
another
never
to
tell
never
to
let
any
one
least
of
all
my
grandfather
know
what
that
forbidden
room
now
contained
i
felt
in
an
irresistible
sort
of
way
that
my
father
s
and
mother
s
honour
was
at
stake
besides
terror
held
me
back
i
felt
that
i
should
die
if
i
spoke
childhood
has
such
terrors
and
such
heroisms
silence
often
covers
in
such
abysses
of
thought
and
feeling
which
astonish
us
in
later
years
there
is
no
suffering
like
a
child
s
terrified
by
a
secret
which
it
dare
not
for
some
reason
disclose
events
aided
me
when
in
desperation
to
see
once
more
the
light
and
all
the
things
which
linked
me
to
life
my
little
bed
the
toys
on
the
my
squirrel
in
its
cage
i
forced
myself
to
retraverse
the
empty
house
expecting
at
every
turn
to
hear
my
father
s
voice
or
come
upon
the
image
of
my
mother
yes
such
was
the
confusion
of
my
mind
though
i
knew
well
enough
even
then
that
they
were
dead
and
that
i
should
never
hear
the
one
or
see
the
other
i
was
so
benumbed
with
the
cold
in
my
condition
that
i
woke
in
a
fever
next
morning
after
a
terrible
dream
which
forced
from
my
lips
the
cry
of
mother
mother
only
that
i
was
cautious
even
in
delirium
this
delirium
and
my
flushed
cheeks
and
shining
eyes
led
them
to
be
very
careful
of
me
i
was
told
that
my
mother
was
away
from
home
and
when
after
two
days
of
search
they
were
quite
sure
that
all
effort
to
find
either
her
or
my
father
were
likely
to
prove
fruitless
that
she
had
gone
to
europe
where
we
would
follow
her
as
soon
as
i
was
well
this
promise
offering
as
it
did
a
prospect
of
immediate
release
from
the
terrors
which
were
consuming
me
had
an
extraordinary
effect
upon
me
i
got
up
out
of
my
bed
saying
that
i
was
well
now
and
ready
to
start
on
the
instant
the
doctor
finding
my
pulse
equable
and
my
whole
condition
wonder
fully
improved
and
attributing
it
as
was
natural
to
my
hope
of
soon
joining
my
mother
advised
my
whim
to
be
humoured
and
this
hope
kept
active
till
travel
and
intercourse
with
children
should
give
me
strength
and
prepare
me
for
the
bitter
truth
ultimately
awaiting
me
they
listened
to
him
and
in
hours
our
preparations
were
made
we
saw
the
house
closed
with
what
emotions
surging
in
one
small
breast
i
leave
you
to
imagine
and
then
started
on
our
long
tour
for
five
years
we
wandered
over
the
continent
of
europe
my
grandfather
finding
distraction
as
well
as
myself
in
foreign
scenes
and
associations
but
return
was
inevitable
what
i
suffered
on
reentering
this
house
god
and
my
sleepless
pillow
alone
know
had
any
discovery
been
made
in
our
absence
or
would
it
be
made
now
that
renovation
and
repairs
of
all
kinds
were
necessary
time
finally
answered
me
my
secret
was
safe
and
likely
to
continue
so
and
this
fact
once
settled
life
became
endurable
if
not
cheerful
since
then
i
have
spent
only
two
nights
out
of
this
house
and
they
were
unavoidable
when
my
grandfather
died
i
had
the
wainscot
door
cemented
in
it
was
done
from
this
side
and
the
cement
painted
to
match
the
wood
no
one
opened
the
door
nor
have
i
ever
crossed
its
threshold
sometimes
i
think
i
have
been
foolish
and
sometimes
i
know
that
i
have
been
very
wise
my
reason
has
stood
firm
how
do
i
know
that
it
would
have
done
so
if
i
had
subjected
myself
to
the
possible
discovery
that
one
or
both
of
them
might
have
been
saved
if
i
had
disclosed
instead
of
concealed
my
a
pause
during
which
white
horror
had
shone
on
every
face
then
with
a
final
glance
at
violet
he
said
what
sequel
do
you
see
to
this
story
miss
strange
i
can
tell
the
past
i
leave
you
to
picture
the
rising
she
let
her
eye
travel
from
face
to
face
till
it
rested
on
the
one
awaiting
it
when
she
answered
dreamily
if
some
morning
in
the
news
column
there
should
appear
an
account
of
the
ancient
and
historic
home
of
the
van
broecklyns
having
burned
to
the
ground
in
the
night
the
whole
country
would
mourn
and
the
city
feel
defrauded
of
one
of
its
treasures
but
there
are
five
persons
who
would
see
in
it
the
sequel
which
you
ask
when
this
happened
as
it
did
happen
some
few
weeks
later
the
astonishing
discovery
was
made
that
no
insurance
had
been
put
upon
this
house
why
was
it
that
after
such
a
loss
van
broecklyn
seemed
to
renew
his
youth
it
was
a
constant
source
of
comment
among
his
friends
end
of
problem
viii
problem
ix
violet
s
own
it
has
been
too
much
for
you
i
am
afraid
it
was
roger
upjohn
who
had
asked
the
question
it
was
violet
who
answered
they
had
withdrawn
from
a
crowd
of
dancers
to
a
balcony
half
open
to
the
moon
a
balcony
made
it
would
seem
for
just
such
stolen
interviews
between
waltzes
now
as
it
happened
roger
s
face
was
in
the
shadow
but
violet
s
in
the
full
light
very
sweet
it
looked
very
ethereal
but
also
a
little
wan
he
noticed
this
and
impetuously
cried
you
are
pale
and
your
hand
see
how
it
trembles
slowly
withdrawing
it
from
the
rail
where
it
had
rested
she
sent
one
quick
glance
his
way
and
in
a
low
voice
said
i
have
not
slept
since
that
four
days
he
murmured
then
after
a
moment
of
silence
you
bore
yourself
so
bravely
at
the
time
i
thought
or
rather
i
hoped
that
success
had
made
you
forget
the
horror
i
could
not
have
slept
myself
if
i
had
known
it
is
part
of
the
price
i
pay
she
broke
in
gently
all
good
things
have
to
be
paid
for
but
i
see
i
realize
that
you
do
not
consider
what
i
am
doing
good
though
it
helps
other
people
has
helped
you
you
wonder
why
with
all
the
advantages
i
possess
i
should
meddle
with
matters
so
repugnant
to
a
woman
s
natural
yes
he
wondered
that
was
evident
from
his
silence
seeing
her
as
she
stood
there
so
quaintly
pretty
so
feminine
in
look
and
manner
in
short
such
a
flower
it
was
but
natural
that
he
should
marvel
at
the
incongruity
she
had
mentioned
it
has
a
strange
odd
look
she
admitted
after
a
moment
of
troubled
hesitation
the
most
considerate
person
can
not
but
regard
it
as
a
display
of
egotism
or
of
a
most
mercenary
spirit
the
cheque
you
sent
me
for
what
i
was
enabled
to
do
for
you
in
massachusetts
the
only
one
i
have
ever
received
which
i
have
been
tempted
to
refuse
shows
to
what
extent
you
rated
my
help
and
my
my
expectations
had
i
been
a
poor
girl
struggling
for
subsistence
this
generosity
would
have
warmed
my
heart
as
a
token
of
your
desire
to
cut
that
struggle
short
but
taken
with
your
knowledge
of
my
home
and
its
luxuries
it
has
often
made
me
wonder
what
you
shall
i
tell
you
he
had
stepped
forward
at
this
question
and
his
countenance
hitherto
concealed
became
visible
in
the
moonlight
she
no
longer
recognized
it
transformed
by
feeling
it
shone
down
upon
her
instinct
with
all
that
is
finest
and
best
in
masculine
nature
was
she
ready
for
this
revelation
of
what
she
had
nevertheless
dreamed
of
for
many
more
nights
than
four
she
did
not
know
and
instinctively
drew
herself
back
till
it
was
she
who
now
stood
in
the
made
by
the
drooping
vines
from
this
retreat
she
faltered
forth
a
very
tremulous
no
which
in
another
moment
was
disavowed
by
a
yes
so
faint
it
was
little
more
than
a
murmur
followed
by
a
still
fainter
tell
me
but
he
did
not
seem
in
any
haste
to
obey
sweetly
as
her
injunction
must
have
sounded
in
his
ears
on
the
contrary
he
hesitated
to
speak
growing
paler
every
minute
as
he
sought
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
her
downcast
face
so
tantalizingly
hidden
from
him
did
she
recognize
the
nature
of
the
feelings
which
held
him
back
or
was
she
simply
gathering
up
sufficient
courage
to
plead
her
own
cause
whatever
her
reason
it
was
she
not
he
who
presently
spoke
saying
as
if
no
time
had
elapsed
but
first
i
feel
obliged
to
admit
that
it
was
money
i
wanted
that
i
had
to
have
not
for
myself
i
lack
nothing
and
could
have
more
if
i
wished
father
has
never
limited
his
generosity
in
any
matter
affecting
myself
but
she
drew
a
deep
breath
and
coming
out
of
the
shadow
lifted
a
face
to
him
so
changed
from
its
usual
expression
as
to
make
him
start
i
have
a
cause
at
heart
one
which
should
appeal
to
my
father
and
does
not
and
for
that
purpose
i
have
sacrificed
myself
in
many
ways
though
though
i
have
not
disliked
my
work
up
to
this
last
attempt
not
really
i
want
to
be
honest
and
so
must
admit
that
much
i
have
even
gloried
quietly
and
all
by
myself
of
course
over
the
solution
of
a
mystery
which
no
one
else
seemed
able
to
penetrate
i
am
made
that
way
i
have
known
it
ever
since
but
that
is
a
story
all
by
itself
some
day
i
may
tell
it
to
you
but
not
no
not
the
emphasis
sent
the
colour
into
her
cheek
but
did
not
relieve
his
pallor
miss
strange
i
have
always
felt
even
in
my
worst
days
that
the
man
who
for
selfish
ends
brought
a
woman
under
the
shadow
of
his
own
unhappy
reputation
was
a
man
to
be
despised
and
i
think
so
still
and
yet
and
yet
nothing
in
the
world
but
your
own
word
or
look
can
hold
me
back
now
from
telling
you
that
i
love
you
love
you
notwithstanding
my
unworthy
past
my
scarring
memories
my
all
but
blasted
hopes
i
do
not
expect
any
response
you
are
young
you
are
beautiful
you
are
gifted
with
every
grace
but
to
speak
to
say
over
and
over
again
i
love
you
i
love
you
eases
my
heart
and
makes
my
future
more
endurable
oh
do
not
look
at
me
like
that
unless
unless
but
the
bright
head
did
not
fall
nor
the
tender
gaze
falter
and
driven
out
of
himself
roger
upjohn
was
about
to
step
passionately
forward
when
seized
by
fresh
compunction
he
hoarsely
cried
it
is
not
right
the
balance
dips
too
much
my
way
you
bring
me
everything
i
can
give
you
nothing
but
what
you
already
possess
abundance
love
and
money
besides
your
father
she
interrupted
him
with
a
glance
at
once
arch
and
earnest
i
had
a
talk
with
father
this
morning
he
came
to
my
room
and
and
it
was
very
near
being
serious
someone
had
told
him
i
was
doing
things
on
the
sly
which
he
had
better
look
into
and
of
course
he
asked
questions
and
and
i
answered
them
he
wasn
t
pleased
in
fact
he
was
very
displeased
i
don
t
think
we
can
blame
him
for
that
but
we
had
no
open
break
for
i
love
him
dearly
for
all
my
opposing
ways
and
he
saw
that
and
it
helped
though
he
did
say
after
i
had
given
my
promise
to
stop
where
i
was
and
never
to
take
up
such
work
again
that
here
she
stole
a
shy
look
at
the
face
bent
so
eagerly
towards
her
that
i
had
lost
my
social
status
and
need
never
hope
now
for
the
attentions
of
of
well
of
such
men
as
he
admires
and
puts
faith
in
so
you
see
her
dimples
all
showing
that
i
am
not
such
a
very
good
match
for
an
upjohn
of
massachusetts
even
if
he
has
a
reputation
to
recover
and
an
honourable
name
to
achieve
the
scale
hangs
more
evenly
than
you
violet
a
mutual
look
a
moment
of
perfect
silence
then
a
low
whisper
airy
as
the
breath
of
flowers
rising
from
the
garden
below
i
have
never
known
what
happiness
was
till
this
moment
if
you
will
take
me
with
my
story
untold
take
you
take
you
the
man
s
whole
yearning
heart
the
loss
and
bitterness
of
years
the
hope
and
promise
of
the
future
all
spoke
in
that
low
exclamation
violet
s
blushes
faded
under
its
fervency
and
only
her
spirit
spoke
as
leaning
towards
him
she
laid
her
two
hands
in
his
and
said
with
all
a
woman
s
earnestness
i
do
not
forget
little
roger
or
the
father
who
i
hope
may
have
many
more
days
before
him
in
which
to
bid
to
the
sea
such
union
as
ours
must
be
hallowed
because
we
have
so
many
persons
to
make
happy
besides
the
evening
before
their
marriage
violet
put
a
dozen
folded
sheets
of
closely
written
paper
in
his
hand
they
contained
her
story
let
us
read
it
with
him
dear
roger
i
could
not
have
been
more
than
seven
years
old
when
one
night
i
woke
up
shivering
at
the
sound
of
angry
voices
a
conversation
which
no
child
should
ever
have
heard
was
going
on
in
the
room
where
i
lay
my
father
was
talking
to
my
sister
perhaps
you
do
not
know
that
i
have
a
sister
few
of
my
personal
friends
do
and
the
terror
she
evinced
i
could
well
understand
but
not
his
words
nor
the
real
cause
of
his
displeasure
there
are
times
even
yet
when
the
picture
forced
upon
my
infantile
consciousness
at
that
moment
of
first
awakening
comes
back
to
me
with
all
its
original
vividness
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
save
such
as
the
moon
made
but
that
was
enough
to
reveal
the
passion
burningly
alive
in
either
face
as
bending
towards
each
other
she
in
supplication
and
he
in
a
tempest
of
wrath
which
knew
no
bounds
he
uttered
and
she
listened
to
what
i
now
know
to
have
been
a
terrible
arraignment
i
may
have
an
interesting
countenance
you
have
told
me
so
sometimes
but
she
she
was
beautiful
my
elder
by
ten
years
she
had
stood
in
my
mother
s
stead
to
me
for
almost
as
long
as
i
could
remember
and
as
i
saw
her
lovely
features
contorted
with
pain
and
her
hands
extended
in
a
desperate
plea
to
one
who
had
never
shown
me
anything
but
love
my
throat
closed
sharply
and
i
could
not
cry
out
though
i
wanted
to
nor
move
head
or
foot
though
i
longed
with
all
my
heart
to
bury
myself
in
the
pillows
for
the
words
i
heard
were
terrifying
little
as
i
comprehended
their
full
purport
he
had
surprised
her
talking
from
her
window
to
someone
down
below
and
after
saying
cruel
things
about
that
he
shouted
out
you
have
disgraced
me
you
have
disgraced
yourself
you
have
disgraced
your
brother
and
your
little
sister
was
it
not
enough
that
you
should
refuse
to
marry
the
good
man
i
had
picked
out
for
you
that
you
should
stoop
to
this
scoundrel
this
i
did
not
hear
what
else
he
called
him
i
was
wondering
so
to
whom
she
had
been
stooping
i
had
never
seen
her
stoop
except
to
tie
my
little
shoes
but
when
she
cried
out
as
she
did
after
an
interval
i
love
him
i
love
him
then
i
listened
again
for
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
in
dreadful
pain
and
i
did
not
know
that
loving
made
one
ill
and
unhappy
and
i
am
going
to
marry
him
i
heard
her
add
standing
up
as
she
said
it
very
straight
and
tall
marry
i
knew
what
that
meant
a
long
aisle
in
a
church
women
in
white
and
big
music
in
the
air
behind
i
had
been
at
a
wedding
once
and
had
not
forgotten
we
had
had
ice
cream
and
cake
and
but
my
childish
thoughts
stopped
short
at
the
answer
she
received
and
all
the
words
which
followed
words
which
burned
their
way
into
my
infantile
brain
and
left
scorched
places
in
my
memory
which
will
never
be
eradicated
he
spoke
them
spoke
them
all
she
never
answered
again
after
that
once
and
when
he
was
gone
did
not
move
for
a
long
time
and
when
she
did
it
was
to
lie
down
stiff
and
straight
just
as
she
had
stood
on
her
bed
alongside
mine
i
was
frightened
so
frightened
my
little
brass
bed
rattled
under
me
i
wonder
she
did
not
hear
it
but
she
heard
nothing
and
after
awhile
she
was
so
still
i
fell
asleep
but
i
woke
again
something
hot
had
fallen
on
my
cheek
i
put
up
my
hand
to
brush
it
away
and
did
not
know
even
when
i
felt
my
fingers
wet
that
it
was
a
tear
from
my
s
eye
for
she
was
kneeling
then
kneeling
close
beside
me
and
her
arm
was
over
my
small
body
and
the
bed
was
shaking
again
but
not
this
time
with
my
tremors
only
and
i
was
sorry
and
cried
too
until
i
dropped
off
to
sleep
again
with
her
arm
still
passionately
embracing
me
in
the
morning
she
was
gone
it
must
have
been
that
very
afternoon
that
father
came
in
where
arthur
and
i
were
trying
to
play
trying
but
not
quite
succeeding
for
i
had
been
telling
arthur
for
whom
i
had
a
great
respect
in
those
days
what
had
happened
the
night
before
and
we
had
been
wondering
in
our
childish
way
if
there
would
be
a
wedding
after
all
and
a
church
full
of
people
and
flowers
and
kissing
and
lots
of
good
things
to
eat
and
arthur
had
said
no
it
was
too
expensive
that
that
was
why
father
was
so
angry
and
comforted
by
the
assertion
i
was
taking
up
my
doll
again
when
the
door
opened
and
father
stepped
in
it
was
a
great
event
any
visit
from
him
to
the
nursery
and
we
both
dropped
our
toys
and
stood
staring
not
knowing
whether
he
was
going
to
be
nice
and
kind
as
he
sometimes
was
or
scold
us
as
i
had
heard
him
scold
our
beautiful
sister
arthur
showed
at
once
what
he
thought
for
without
the
least
hesitation
he
took
the
one
step
which
placed
him
in
front
of
me
where
he
stood
waiting
with
his
two
little
fists
hanging
straight
at
his
sides
but
manfully
clenched
in
full
readiness
for
attack
that
this
display
of
pigmy
chivalry
was
not
quite
without
its
warrant
is
evident
to
me
now
for
father
did
not
look
like
himself
or
act
like
himself
any
more
than
he
had
the
night
before
however
we
had
no
cause
for
fear
having
no
suspicion
of
my
having
been
awake
during
his
terrible
interview
with
theresa
he
saw
only
two
lonely
and
forsaken
children
interrupted
in
their
play
can
i
remember
what
he
said
to
us
not
exactly
though
arthur
and
i
often
went
over
it
choked
whispers
in
some
secret
nook
of
the
dreary
old
house
but
his
meaning
that
we
took
in
well
enough
theresa
had
left
us
she
would
never
come
back
we
were
not
to
look
out
of
the
window
for
her
or
run
to
the
door
when
the
bell
rang
our
mother
had
left
us
too
a
long
time
ago
and
she
lay
in
the
cemetery
where
we
sometimes
carried
flowers
theresa
was
not
in
the
cemetery
but
we
must
think
of
her
as
there
though
not
as
if
she
had
any
need
of
flowers
having
said
this
he
looked
at
us
quietly
for
a
minute
arthur
was
trying
very
hard
not
to
cry
but
i
was
sobbing
like
the
lost
child
i
was
with
my
cheek
against
the
floor
where
i
had
thrown
myself
when
he
said
that
awful
thing
about
the
cemetery
she
there
my
there
i
think
he
felt
a
little
sorry
for
me
for
he
half
stooped
as
if
to
lift
me
up
but
he
straightened
again
and
said
very
sternly
now
children
listen
to
me
when
god
takes
people
to
heaven
and
leaves
us
only
their
cold
dead
bodies
we
carry
flowers
to
their
graves
and
talk
about
them
some
if
not
very
much
but
when
people
die
because
they
love
dark
ways
better
than
light
then
we
do
not
remember
them
with
gifts
and
we
do
not
talk
about
them
your
sister
s
name
has
been
spoken
for
the
last
time
in
this
house
you
arthur
are
old
enough
to
know
what
i
mean
when
i
say
that
i
will
never
listen
to
another
word
about
her
from
either
you
or
violet
as
long
as
you
and
i
live
she
is
gone
and
nothing
that
is
mine
shall
she
ever
touch
again
you
hear
me
arthur
you
hear
me
violet
heed
me
or
you
go
his
aspect
was
terrible
so
was
his
purpose
much
more
terrible
than
we
realized
at
the
time
with
our
limited
understanding
and
experience
later
we
came
to
know
the
full
meaning
of
this
black
drop
which
had
been
infused
into
our
lives
when
we
saw
every
picture
of
her
destroyed
which
had
been
in
the
house
her
name
cut
out
from
the
leaves
of
books
the
little
tokens
she
had
given
us
surreptitiously
taken
away
till
not
a
vestige
of
her
once
beloved
presence
remained
we
began
to
realize
that
we
had
indeed
lost
her
but
children
as
young
as
we
were
then
do
not
long
retain
the
poignancy
of
their
first
griefs
gradually
my
memories
of
that
awful
night
ceased
to
disturb
my
dreams
and
i
was
sixteen
before
they
were
again
recalled
to
me
with
any
vividness
and
then
it
was
by
accident
i
had
been
strolling
through
a
picture
gallery
and
had
stopped
short
to
study
more
particularly
one
which
had
especially
taken
my
fancy
there
were
two
ladies
sitting
on
a
bench
behind
me
and
one
of
them
was
evidently
very
deaf
for
their
talk
was
loud
though
i
am
sure
they
did
not
mean
for
me
to
hear
for
they
were
discussing
my
family
that
is
one
of
them
had
said
that
s
violet
strange
she
will
never
be
the
beauty
her
sister
was
but
perhaps
that
s
not
to
be
deplored
theresa
made
a
great
mess
of
that
s
true
i
hear
that
she
and
the
signor
have
been
seen
lately
here
in
town
in
poverty
of
course
he
hadn
t
even
as
much
go
in
him
as
the
ordinary
i
suppose
i
should
have
hurried
away
and
left
this
barbed
arrow
to
rankle
where
it
fell
but
i
could
not
i
had
never
learned
a
word
of
theresa
s
fate
and
that
word
poverty
proving
that
she
was
alive
and
suffering
held
me
to
my
place
to
hear
what
more
they
might
say
of
her
who
for
years
had
been
for
me
an
indistinct
figure
bathed
in
cruel
moonlight
i
have
never
approved
of
peter
strange
s
conduct
at
that
time
one
of
the
voices
now
went
on
he
didn
t
handle
her
right
she
had
a
lovely
disposition
and
would
have
listened
to
him
had
he
been
more
gentle
with
her
but
it
isn
t
in
him
i
hope
this
one
i
didn
t
hear
the
end
of
that
i
had
no
interest
in
anything
they
might
say
about
myself
it
was
of
her
i
wanted
to
hear
of
her
weren
t
they
going
to
say
anything
more
about
my
poor
sister
yes
it
was
a
topic
which
interested
both
and
presently
i
heard
he
ll
never
do
anything
for
her
no
matter
what
happens
i
ve
heard
him
say
so
and
laura
has
vowed
the
laura
is
our
aunt
besides
theresa
has
a
pride
of
her
own
quite
equal
to
her
father
s
she
wouldn
t
take
anything
from
him
now
she
d
rather
struggle
on
i
m
told
i
don
t
know
how
true
it
is
that
she
s
working
in
a
department
store
one
of
the
sixth
avenue
ones
oh
there
s
vandegraff
don
t
you
want
to
speak
to
her
they
moved
off
leaving
me
still
gazing
with
unseeing
eyes
at
the
picture
before
which
i
stood
planted
and
saying
over
and
over
in
monotonous
iteration
one
of
the
department
stores
in
sixth
avenue
one
of
the
department
stores
in
sixth
avenue
which
department
store
i
meant
to
find
out
i
do
not
know
whether
up
till
then
i
had
had
the
least
consciousness
of
possessing
what
is
called
the
detective
instinct
but
at
the
prospect
of
this
quest
so
much
like
that
of
the
proverbial
needle
in
a
haystack
as
i
did
not
even
know
my
sister
s
married
name
and
something
within
me
forbade
my
asking
it
i
experienced
an
odd
sense
of
elation
followed
by
a
certainty
of
success
which
in
five
minutes
changed
me
from
an
irresponsible
girl
to
a
woman
with
a
deliberate
purpose
in
life
i
am
not
going
to
write
down
here
all
the
details
of
that
search
some
day
i
may
relate
them
to
you
but
not
now
i
looked
first
for
a
beautiful
woman
for
the
straight
slim
and
exquisite
creature
i
remembered
i
did
not
find
her
then
i
tried
another
course
her
figure
might
have
changed
in
the
ten
years
which
had
elapsed
so
might
her
expression
i
would
look
for
a
woman
with
beautiful
dark
eyes
time
could
not
have
altered
them
i
had
forgotten
the
effect
of
constant
weeping
and
i
saw
many
eyes
but
not
hers
not
the
ones
i
had
seen
smiling
upon
me
as
i
lay
in
my
crib
before
the
days
i
was
lifted
to
the
dignity
of
the
little
brass
bed
so
i
gave
that
up
too
and
listened
to
the
inner
voice
which
said
you
must
wait
for
her
to
recognize
you
you
can
never
hope
to
recognize
and
it
was
by
following
this
plan
that
i
found
her
i
had
arranged
to
have
my
name
spoken
aloud
at
every
counter
where
i
bargained
and
oh
the
bargains
i
sought
and
the
garments
i
had
tried
on
but
i
made
little
progress
until
one
day
after
my
name
had
been
uttered
a
little
louder
than
usual
i
saw
a
woman
turn
from
rearranging
gowns
on
a
hanger
and
give
me
one
look
i
uttered
a
low
cry
and
sprang
impetuously
forward
instantly
she
turned
her
back
and
went
on
hanging
or
trying
to
hang
up
gowns
on
the
rack
before
her
had
i
been
mistaken
she
was
not
the
sister
of
my
dreams
but
there
was
something
fine
in
her
outline
something
distinguished
in
the
way
she
carried
her
head
which
next
minute
my
last
doubt
fled
she
had
fallen
her
length
on
the
floor
and
lay
with
her
face
buried
in
her
hands
in
a
dead
faint
oh
roger
roger
roger
i
had
that
dear
head
on
my
breast
in
a
moment
i
talked
to
her
i
whispered
prayers
in
her
unconscious
ear
i
did
everything
i
should
not
have
done
till
they
all
thought
me
demented
when
she
came
to
as
she
did
under
other
ministrations
than
mine
i
was
for
carrying
her
off
in
my
limousine
but
she
shook
her
head
with
a
gesture
of
such
disapproval
that
i
realized
i
could
not
do
that
the
limousine
was
my
father
s
and
nothing
of
his
was
ever
to
be
used
for
her
again
i
would
call
a
cab
but
she
told
me
that
she
had
not
the
money
to
pay
for
it
and
she
would
not
take
mine
carfare
she
had
five
cents
would
take
her
home
i
need
not
worry
she
smiled
as
she
said
this
and
for
an
instant
i
saw
my
again
in
this
weary
woman
but
the
smile
was
a
fleeting
one
for
this
was
to
be
her
last
day
in
the
store
she
had
no
talent
as
a
saleswoman
and
was
merely
working
out
her
week
i
felt
my
heart
sink
heavily
at
this
for
the
evidences
of
poverty
were
plainly
to
be
seen
in
her
clothes
and
the
thinness
of
her
face
and
figure
how
could
i
help
what
could
i
do
i
took
her
to
a
restaurant
for
food
and
talk
and
before
she
would
order
she
looked
into
her
purse
with
the
result
that
we
had
only
a
little
toast
and
tea
it
was
all
she
could
afford
and
i
with
a
hundred
dollars
in
bills
at
that
moment
in
my
bag
could
not
offer
her
anything
more
though
she
was
needing
nourishment
and
dishes
piled
with
savoury
meats
were
going
by
us
every
moment
i
think
if
she
had
let
me
i
would
have
dared
my
father
s
displeasure
and
been
disobedient
to
his
wishes
by
giving
her
one
wholesome
meal
but
she
was
as
resolute
of
mind
as
he
and
as
she
said
afterwards
had
chosen
her
course
in
life
and
must
abide
by
it
my
love
she
would
accept
it
took
nothing
from
father
and
gave
her
what
her
heart
was
pining
for
had
pined
for
for
years
but
nothing
more
not
another
thing
more
she
would
not
even
let
me
go
home
with
her
and
i
knew
why
when
her
eyes
fell
at
the
searching
look
i
gave
her
something
would
turn
up
and
when
her
husband
s
health
was
better
and
she
had
found
another
position
she
would
send
me
her
address
and
then
i
could
come
and
see
her
as
we
walked
out
of
the
restaurant
we
ran
against
a
gentleman
i
knew
he
stopped
me
for
a
passing
word
and
in
that
minute
she
disappeared
i
did
not
try
to
follow
her
i
could
get
her
street
and
number
from
the
store
where
she
had
worked
but
when
i
had
done
this
and
embraced
the
first
opportunity
which
offered
to
visit
her
i
found
that
she
had
moved
away
in
the
interim
leaving
everything
behind
in
payment
of
her
rent
except
such
small
things
as
she
and
her
husband
could
carry
this
was
discouraging
as
it
left
me
without
any
clue
by
which
to
follow
them
but
i
was
determined
not
to
yield
to
her
desire
for
concealment
in
the
difficult
and
disheartening
task
i
now
saw
before
me
seeking
advice
from
the
man
who
has
since
become
my
employer
i
entered
upon
this
second
search
with
a
quiet
resolution
which
admitted
of
no
defeat
it
took
me
six
months
but
i
finally
found
her
and
satisfied
with
knowing
where
she
was
desisted
from
rushing
in
upon
her
till
i
had
caught
one
glimpse
of
her
husband
whom
in
the
last
six
months
i
had
heard
described
but
had
never
seen
to
understand
her
it
was
perhaps
necessary
to
understand
him
and
if
i
could
not
hope
to
do
this
offhand
i
could
not
fail
to
get
some
idea
of
the
man
from
even
the
most
casual
look
he
was
as
i
soon
learned
the
fetcher
and
carrier
of
the
small
ménage
and
the
day
came
when
i
met
him
face
to
face
in
the
street
where
they
lived
did
he
disappoint
me
or
did
i
see
something
in
his
appearance
to
justify
her
desertion
of
her
father
s
home
and
her
present
life
of
poverty
if
i
say
yes
to
the
first
question
i
must
also
say
it
to
the
last
if
handsome
once
he
was
not
handsome
now
but
with
a
personality
such
as
his
this
did
not
matter
he
had
that
better
thing
that
greatest
gift
of
the
gods
charm
it
was
in
his
bearing
his
movement
the
regard
of
his
weary
eye
more
than
that
it
was
in
his
very
nature
or
it
would
have
vanished
long
ago
under
disappointment
and
privation
but
that
was
all
there
was
to
the
man
a
golden
net
in
which
my
sister
s
youthful
fancy
had
been
caught
and
no
doubt
held
meshed
to
this
very
day
i
felt
less
like
blaming
her
for
her
folly
after
that
instant
s
view
of
him
as
we
passed
each
other
in
the
street
but
as
i
took
time
to
think
i
found
myself
growing
sorrier
and
sorrier
for
her
and
yet
in
a
way
gladder
and
gladder
for
the
man
was
a
physical
wreck
and
would
soon
pass
out
of
her
life
leaving
her
to
my
love
and
possibly
to
our
father
s
forgiveness
but
i
did
not
know
theresa
after
her
husband
s
death
which
occurred
very
soon
she
let
me
come
to
her
and
we
had
a
long
talk
shall
i
ever
forget
it
or
the
sight
of
her
beauty
in
that
sordid
room
for
account
for
it
as
you
will
the
loveliness
which
had
fled
under
her
sense
of
complete
isolation
had
slowly
regained
its
own
with
the
recognition
that
she
still
had
a
place
in
the
heart
of
her
little
sister
not
even
the
sorrow
she
felt
for
the
loss
of
her
suffering
husband
and
she
did
mourn
him
this
i
am
glad
to
say
could
more
than
temporarily
stay
this
six
months
of
ease
and
wholesome
food
would
make
her
i
hardly
dared
to
think
what
for
i
knew
without
asking
her
or
she
telling
me
that
she
would
accept
neither
that
she
was
as
determined
now
as
ever
that
nothing
which
came
directly
or
indirectly
from
father
should
go
to
the
rebuilding
of
her
life
that
she
intended
to
start
anew
and
work
her
way
up
to
a
place
where
i
should
be
glad
to
see
her
she
did
say
but
nothing
more
she
was
still
the
loving
but
sufficient
to
herself
though
she
had
but
ten
dollars
left
in
the
world
as
she
showed
me
with
a
smile
that
made
her
beautiful
as
an
angel
i
can
see
that
shabby
little
purse
yet
with
its
one
poor
greasy
bill
a
sum
to
her
but
to
me
the
price
of
a
luncheon
or
a
gift
of
flowers
how
i
longed
as
i
looked
at
it
to
tear
every
jewel
from
my
poor
bedecked
body
and
fling
them
one
and
all
into
her
lap
i
had
worn
them
in
profusion
though
carefully
hidden
under
my
coat
in
the
hope
that
she
would
accept
one
of
them
at
least
but
she
refused
all
even
such
as
had
been
gifts
of
friends
and
schoolmates
only
humouring
me
this
far
that
she
let
me
hang
them
for
a
few
minutes
about
her
neck
and
in
her
hair
and
then
pull
them
all
off
again
but
this
one
vision
of
her
in
the
splendour
she
was
born
to
comforted
me
henceforth
in
wearing
them
it
would
be
of
her
and
not
of
myself
i
should
think
well
i
had
to
leave
her
and
go
home
to
my
french
and
italian
lessons
my
and
all
the
luxuries
of
our
father
s
house
should
i
ever
see
her
again
i
did
not
know
she
had
not
promised
i
could
not
go
often
into
the
quarter
where
she
lived
without
rousing
suspicion
and
she
had
bidden
me
not
to
come
again
for
a
month
so
i
waited
half
fearing
she
would
flit
again
before
the
month
was
up
but
she
did
not
she
was
still
there
when
but
i
am
going
too
fast
the
meeting
i
was
about
to
mention
was
a
very
memorable
one
to
me
and
i
must
describe
it
from
the
beginning
i
had
ridden
in
my
own
car
as
near
as
i
dared
to
the
street
where
she
lived
the
rest
of
the
way
i
went
on
foot
with
one
of
the
servants
a
new
one
following
close
behind
me
i
was
not
exactly
afraid
but
the
actions
of
some
of
the
people
i
had
encountered
at
my
former
visit
warned
me
to
be
a
little
careful
for
my
father
s
sake
if
not
for
my
own
her
room
she
had
but
one
was
high
up
in
a
triangular
court
it
was
no
pleasure
to
enter
but
love
and
loyalty
heed
nothing
but
the
object
sought
and
i
was
hunting
about
for
the
dark
doorway
which
opened
upon
the
staircase
leading
to
her
room
when
and
this
was
the
great
moment
of
my
life
a
sudden
stream
of
melody
floated
down
into
that
noisome
court
which
from
its
clearness
its
accuracy
its
richness
and
its
feeling
startled
me
as
i
had
never
before
been
startled
even
by
the
first
notes
of
the
world
s
greatest
singers
what
a
voice
for
a
place
like
this
what
a
voice
for
any
place
whose
could
it
be
with
a
start
i
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
that
court
heedless
of
the
crowd
of
pushing
shouting
children
who
at
once
gathered
about
me
i
had
been
struck
by
an
old
recollection
my
sister
used
to
sing
i
remembered
where
her
piano
had
stood
in
the
great
it
had
been
carted
away
during
those
dreadful
weeks
and
her
music
all
burned
but
the
vision
of
her
graceful
figure
bending
over
the
keyboard
was
one
not
to
be
forgotten
even
by
a
thoughtless
child
could
it
be
oh
heaven
if
this
voice
were
hers
her
future
was
certain
she
had
but
to
sing
in
a
transport
of
hope
i
rushed
for
the
dim
entrance
the
children
had
pointed
out
and
flew
up
to
her
room
as
i
reached
it
i
heard
a
trill
as
perfect
as
tetrazzini
s
the
singer
was
theresa
there
could
be
no
more
doubt
theresa
exercising
a
grand
voice
as
only
a
great
artist
would
or
could
the
joy
of
it
made
me
almost
faint
i
leaned
against
her
door
and
sobbed
then
when
i
thought
i
could
speak
quite
calmly
i
went
in
roger
you
must
understand
me
now
my
desire
for
money
and
the
means
i
have
taken
to
obtain
it
my
sister
had
the
makings
of
a
her
husband
of
whose
ability
i
had
formed
so
low
an
estimate
had
trained
her
with
consummate
skill
and
judgment
all
she
needed
was
a
year
with
some
great
maestro
in
the
foreign
atmosphere
of
art
but
this
meant
money
not
hundreds
but
thousands
and
the
one
sure
source
to
which
we
might
rightfully
look
for
any
such
amount
was
effectually
closed
to
us
it
is
true
we
had
relatives
an
aunt
on
our
mother
s
side
and
i
mentioned
her
to
theresa
but
she
would
not
listen
to
the
suggestion
she
would
take
nothing
from
any
one
whom
she
would
find
it
hard
to
face
in
case
of
failure
love
must
go
with
an
advance
involving
so
much
risk
love
deep
enough
and
strong
enough
to
feel
no
loss
save
that
of
a
defeated
hope
in
short
to
be
acceptable
the
money
must
come
from
me
and
as
this
was
manifestly
impossible
she
considered
the
matter
closed
and
began
to
talk
of
a
position
she
had
been
offered
in
some
choir
i
let
her
talk
listening
and
not
listening
for
the
idea
had
come
to
me
that
if
in
some
way
i
could
earn
money
she
might
be
induced
to
take
it
finally
i
asked
her
she
laughed
letting
her
kisses
answer
me
but
i
did
not
laugh
if
she
had
capabilities
in
one
way
i
had
them
in
another
i
went
home
to
think
two
weeks
later
i
began
in
a
very
quiet
way
to
do
certain
work
for
the
man
who
had
helped
me
in
my
second
search
for
theresa
the
money
i
have
earned
has
been
immense
since
it
was
troubles
of
the
rich
i
was
given
to
settle
and
i
was
almost
always
successful
every
cent
has
gone
to
her
she
has
been
in
europe
for
a
year
and
last
week
she
made
her
debut
you
read
about
it
in
the
papers
but
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
in
this
country
but
myself
knew
that
under
the
name
she
chosen
to
assume
theresa
strange
the
long
forgotten
beauty
has
recovered
that
place
in
the
world
to
which
her
love
and
genius
entitle
her
this
is
my
story
and
hers
from
now
on
you
are
the
third
in
the
secret
some
day
my
father
will
be
the
fourth
i
think
then
a
new
dawn
of
love
will
arise
for
us
all
which
will
stay
the
whitening
of
his
dear
head
for
i
believe
in
him
after
all
yesterday
when
he
passed
the
wall
where
her
picture
once
hung
no
other
has
ever
hung
there
i
saw
him
stop
and
look
up
and
roger
when
he
passed
me
a
minute
later
there
was
a
tear
in
his
hard
eye
