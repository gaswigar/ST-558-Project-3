forty
years
among
the
indians
a
true
yet
thrilling
narrative
of
the
experiences
among
the
natives
by
daniel
w
jones
published
at
the
juvenile
instructor
office
salt
lake
city
utah
copyright
applied
for
preface
the
scriptures
tell
us
that
the
truth
should
not
be
spoken
at
all
times
does
this
imply
that
a
falsehood
should
ever
be
told
i
think
not
but
simply
means
that
silence
is
often
profitable
in
answer
to
the
solicitation
of
many
friends
i
have
concluded
to
write
something
of
my
personal
history
and
experience
in
frontier
life
especially
relating
to
that
portion
spent
among
the
indians
and
mexicans
in
doing
this
i
shall
aim
to
write
the
plain
simple
truth
i
have
to
trust
mainly
to
my
memory
never
having
kept
a
journal
i
have
preserved
a
few
letters
that
will
aid
me
but
the
greater
part
of
this
history
will
be
given
as
it
comes
to
my
mind
just
as
it
occurred
to
me
at
the
time
modified
or
strengthened
as
the
case
may
be
by
after
circumstances
one
rule
i
shall
endeavor
to
follow
to
speak
the
truth
without
malice
toward
anyone
this
will
doubtless
be
hard
for
me
to
carry
through
but
i
make
a
record
of
the
desire
that
it
may
be
continually
before
me
if
the
educated
reader
should
find
any
mistakes
in
this
book
please
do
not
spend
much
time
or
money
in
pointing
them
out
as
they
may
be
too
common
no
one
has
been
paid
for
a
literary
revision
the
author
has
used
his
own

year
i
crossed
the
plains
with
the
volunteers
from
louis
missouri
going
out
to
take
part
in
the
war
with
mexico
at
that
time
the
comanche
indians
were
a
power
on
the
plains
the
battalion
i
belonged
to
was
attacked
while
in
camp
on
the
arkansas
river
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
were
sand
hills
wood
was
very
scarce
in
the
region
and
on
arriving
in
camp
it
was
customary
for
a
number
of
the
most
active
young
men
to
go
out
in
search
of
fuel
generally
buffalo
chips
on
looking
across
the
river
there
was
seen
a
few
small
piles
of
what
looked
like
driftwood
this
had
been
placed
there
by
the
indians
as
a
decoy
but
no
suspicion
was
felt
at
the
time
as
we
had
heretofore
seen
no
indians
neither
was
there
anyone
along
who
understood
the
tricks
some
thirty
men
started
in
haste
for
this
wood
only
one
man
taking
his
gun
one
other
had
a
small
pocket
pistol
a
few
of
the
most
active
men
secured
the
wood
piled
up
whilst
the
others
remained
gathering
the
scattered
sticks
and
picking
berries
that
grew
among
the
suddenly
there
charged
upon
them
about
mounted
comanches
using
their
long
sharp
spears
they
would
ride
a
man
down
spear
him
through
catch
him
by
the
hair
and
scalp
him
without
dismounting
they
killed
and
scalped
eight
men
wounding
and
scalping
another
that
recovered
although
there
was
a
battalion
of
infantry
and
a
company
of
cavalry
in
camp
this
was
done
before
help
could
reach
the
men
the
men
in
camp
rushed
across
the
river
firing
at
the
indians
who
retreated
as
soon
as
they
were
in
danger
the
cavalry
company
mounted
and
pursued
for
some
time
but
could
not
overtake
the
indians
this
was
my
first
introduction
to
indians
after
this
we
were
more
watchful
many
attacks
were
made
and
men
killed
in
those
days
in
open
daylight
in
what
might
be
termed
a
fair
field
fight
while
others
were
surprised
and
sometimes
whole
parties
murdered
as
was
the
mail
company
at
wagon
mound
in
some
of
them
were
personal
friends
of
mine
at
that
time
in
common
with
white
men
generally
i
looked
upon
all
indians
as
fit
only
to
be
killed
after
the
war
was
over
i
remained
in
mexico
until
july
of
my
stay
in
that
country
for
some
three
years
i
will
give
only
a
brief
sketch
and
write
that
which
has
a
bearing
on
my
future
life
and
actions
as
will
be
given
in
this
work
there
are
many
things
that
have
occurred
in
my
experience
which
might
be
interesting
to
some
but
not
to
the
general
reader
i
will
say
this
and
say
it
truly
i
took
part
in
many
ways
in
the
wild
reckless
life
that
was
common
in
that
land
so
much
so
that
i
often
felt
condemned
and
longed
for
something
to
call
me
away
from
where
i
was
and
lead
me
from
the
evils
i
was
surrounded
by
i
had
much
pride
always
believing
myself
better
than
many
others
this
caused
me
to
preserve
myself
from
degradation
there
was
a
feeling
continually
with
me
that
if
i
would
keep
my
body
pure
and
healthy
i
would
yet
find
a
condition
in
life
that
would
be
satisfactory
to
me
this
spirit
enabled
me
to
abstain
from
strong
drink
and
other
worse
vices
that
i
could
see
were
destroying
the
lives
of
my
associates
notwithstanding
this
i
found
enough
to
practice
in
the
way
of
gambling
swearing
fighting
and
other
rough
conduct
to
feel
heartily
condemned
in
my
own
conscience
while
in
mexico
i
formed
a
kindly
feeling
toward
many
of
the
mexican
people
studied
the
spanish
language
so
as
to
read
and
write
it
and
act
as
interpreter
my
mind
often
reverts
to
those
days
i
had
been
left
an
orphan
at
eleven
years
of
age
i
then
left
all
my
friends
and
relatives
and
went
out
into
the
world
alone
probably
as
willful
a
boy
as
ever
lived
no
one
could
control
me
by
any
other
means
than
kindness
and
this
i
did
not
often
meet
with
the
result
was
i
found
myself
among
rough
people
in
a
wild
country
among
those
who
knew
no
law
but
the
knife
and
pistol
the
old
texas
rangers
and
many
of
the
missouri
planters
being
the
leading
characters
i
often
wonder
how
i
got
through
and
i
can
only
account
for
it
in
one
way
i
did
not
like
this
way
of
living
i
felt
condemned
and
often
asked
god
in
all
earnestness
to
help
me
to
see
what
was
right
and
how
to
serve
him
telling
him
i
wanted
to
know
positively
and
not
be
deceived
i
felt
that
the
people
of
this
age
ought
to
have
prophets
to
guide
them
the
same
as
of
old
and
that
it
was
not
a
square
thing
to
leave
them
without
anything
but
the
bible
for
that
could
not
be
sufficient
or
the
people
would
not
dispute
so
much
over
it
these
feelings
grew
upon
me
and
i
began
to
be
more
careful
of
my
conduct
and
felt
a
greater
desire
to
leave
the
country
chapter
ii
learn
of
the
mormons
leave
with
a
company
bound
for
salt
lake
valley
with
eight
thousand
sheep
my
first
big
scare
surrounded
and
threatened
by
indians
many
times
on
the
road
surrounded
by
five
hundred
warriors
demanding
the
death
of
a
man
from
our
camp
as
the
chiefs
son
had
died
meet
with
an
accident
which
nearly
resulted
in
my
death
in
the
summer
of
quite
a
large
company
fitted
up
at
santa
fe
new
mexico
to
go
to
california
by
the
old
spanish
trail
leading
to
salt
lake
thence
by
the
northern
route
to
upper
california
i
had
heard
some
strange
stories
about
the
mormons
such
as
were
common
at
that
time
i
heard
of
the
mormon
battalion
and
pioneer
move
to
great
salt
lake
a
country
then
only
known
as
the
great
desert
of
america
that
the
mormons
had
moved
into
the
desert
away
from
everyone
etc
my
sympathy
was
drawn
toward
them
for
i
had
often
felt
as
though
i
wanted
to
find
something
different
from
anything
yet
seen
so
when
i
heard
of
this
company
being
made
up
to
go
through
the
salt
lake
country
i
determined
to
make
the
trip
with
them
at
that
time
the
ute
nation
was
very
powerful
possessing
the
country
from
near
the
settlements
of
new
mexico
clear
to
utah
valley
they
were
known
as
a
proud
haughty
people
demanding
tribute
from
all
who
passed
through
their
country
even
in
times
of
peace
the
party
fitting
up
were
taking
through
some
eight
thousand
head
of
sheep
the
old
mountaineers
prophesied
that
we
would
never
get
through
the
ute
country
with
so
much
to
tempt
the
indians
however
the
owners
concluded
to
risk
the
venture
as
mutton
was
very
high
at
the
mines
in
california
we
left
the
settlements
of
new
mexico
at
abiquin
the
trail
soon
entering
the
wild
mountain
country
which
was
at
that
time
only
known
to
a
few
venturesome
traders
and
to
mexicans
very
few
white
men
had
ever
been
through
the
country
at
the
time
of
our
trip
the
utes
were
supposed
to
be
at
peace
but
peace
in
those
days
meant
that
if
they
could
rob
without
killing
you
all
well
but
if
necessary
to
do
a
little
killing
without
scalping
they
considered
themselves
quite
friendly
scalping
means
hating
often
when
remonstrating
with
indians
for
killing
people
they
would
say
they
did
not
scalp
them
on
enquiring
what
this
meant
i
finally
learned
that
the
indians
believed
that
in
the
spirit
world
friends
recognized
each
other
by
the
hair
and
when
they
were
scalped
did
not
know
one
another
this
accounts
for
the
great
risk
they
will
run
to
remove
those
killed
in
battle
to
prevent
their
falling
into
the
hands
of
the
enemy
nothing
exciting
occurred
for
several
days
after
leaving
the
settlements
our
first
meeting
with
indians
was
on
the
rio
piedras
a
day
travel
beyond
the
crossing
of
the
rio
san
juan
here
i
got
my
first
scare
the
river
bottom
was
spotted
with
cottonwood
trees
and
willow
groves
on
arriving
in
camp
a
small
party
of
us
unsaddled
and
started
to
the
river
to
take
a
bath
passing
through
several
yards
of
willows
before
getting
to
the
river
while
enjoying
ourselves
bathing
we
heard
a
volley
of
rifle
shots
from
the
direction
of
camp
the
shots
continued
to
rattle
for
some
time
then
a
stray
shot
occasionally
finishing
off
just
as
a
battle
with
indians
naturally
would
we
were
out
of
the
water
and
dressed
in
short
order
fully
believing
that
our
camp
had
been
attacked
and
probably
all
killed
we
rushed
for
the
brush
to
hide
i
got
separated
from
the
rest
hid
myself
and
laid
quiet
reflecting
upon
my
situation
my
only
chance
for
life
seemed
to
be
to
keep
hid
until
night
then
try
and
get
on
the
trail
and
travel
back
to
the
settlements
over
one
hundred
miles
distant
this
i
fully
expected
to
try
and
hoped
to
accomplish
finally
i
gained
courage
enough
to
creep
to
the
edge
of
the
willows
toward
camp
to
see
if
i
could
discover
what
had
become
of
the
camp
in
and
around
where
we
had
unsaddled
i
saw
a
great
lot
of
savage
looking
indians
on
horseback
some
were
still
others
moving
about
i
dodged
down
now
fully
convinced
that
all
our
company
was
killed
i
lay
for
a
few
moments
in
terrible
fear
when
i
looked
out
again
taking
a
careful
survey
of
camp
i
discerned
one
of
our
company
hanging
a
over
a
fire
soon
i
saw
some
others
engaged
in
camp
work
i
now
concluded
that
the
indians
had
spared
a
few
and
put
them
to
cooking
so
i
decided
to
surrender
as
a
prisoner
when
i
approached
near
camp
i
saw
most
of
the
company
attending
to
their
own
affairs
as
usual
i
concluded
to
say
nothing
about
my
scare
and
walked
in
quite
unconcernedly
asked
what
they
had
been
firing
at
when
i
was
told
that
just
as
the
indians
came
into
camp
a
band
of
deer
had
run
by
both
indians
and
whites
had
been
firing
at
and
had
killed
several
deer
the
indians
were
perfectly
friendly
and
all
hands
were
making
ready
to
enjoy
a
feast
of
fat
venison
i
kept
silent
no
one
but
myself
knew
how
i
suffered
during
my
first
big
scare
i
never
questioned
my
companions
about
our
mutual
fright
neither
did
they
ever
make
any
reference
to
the
affair
why
i
do
not
know
unless
they
like
myself
were
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
we
were
surrounded
and
threatened
by
the
indians
many
times
on
the
road
but
through
the
influence
of
our
guide
and
interpreter
we
were
allowed
to
pass
along
on
easy
terms
we
had
for
guide
thomas
chacon
a
mexican
indian
the
same
who
will
be
remembered
by
many
of
the
mormon
battalion
as
he
traveled
in
company
with
them
as
assistant
guide
and
returned
and
wintered
at
the
old
fort
in
salt
lake
in
once
at
the
bend
of
the
dolores
river
our
chances
for
life
seemed
very
slim
we
were
surrounded
by
over
five
hundred
warriors
well
armed
we
numbered
about
fifty
men
mostly
americans
the
chief
had
sent
a
deputation
to
our
camp
on
the
mancos
river
the
day
before
stating
that
his
son
had
died
and
that
either
an
american
or
mexican
would
be
demanded
from
our
camp
for
a
sacrifice
and
if
not
given
up
peaceably
war
would
be
opened
upon
us
and
all
would
be
killed
this
demand
was
made
by
the
old
elk
mountain
chief
our
interpreter
who
had
lived
many
years
among
these
indians
felt
quite
uneasy
telling
us
of
the
power
of
this
chief
and
his
tribe
he
did
not
advise
us
to
give
up
a
man
but
probably
would
not
have
objected
as
he
knew
we
could
not
spare
hint
he
being
the
only
one
who
knew
the
trail
captain
angley
who
had
charge
of
this
company
looked
upon
the
threat
as
an
insult
and
told
the
indians
to
say
to
their
chief
that
he
had
no
men
to
voluntarily
give
up
but
plenty
to
fight
if
he
wanted
any
to
kill
he
would
have
to
fight
for
them
we
were
a
half
day
march
from
the
great
chief
camp
and
i
will
admit
that
i
was
frightened
for
i
was
much
under
the
influence
of
the
old
guide
being
conversant
with
his
language
i
was
in
the
habit
of
riding
along
with
him
and
listening
to
his
talk
about
the
indians
he
often
told
me
how
he
succeeded
in
making
peace
with
them
previous
to
this
time
we
had
had
several
close
calls
but
old
thomas
seemed
to
always
have
some
way
to
talk
the
indians
into
peace
this
time
he
appeared
uneasy
and
fearful
on
arriving
at
the
big
bend
of
the
dolores
we
took
the
best
position
possible
for
defence
where
there
was
some
fallen
timber
soon
the
indians
commenced
crossing
the
river
above
us
on
horseback
and
fully
prepared
for
battle
there
were
about
fifty
of
them
all
well
armed
and
mounted
they
took
position
some
two
hundred
yards
from
camp
in
a
line
facing
us
and
there
stood
i
was
keen
to
commence
firing
upon
them
thinking
if
we
got
in
the
first
shot
we
would
be
more
likely
to
conquer
and
several
of
the
company
felt
the
same
but
when
we
tried
to
urge
this
upon
the
captain
and
old
thomas
for
nothing
was
done
without
the
guide
consent
when
indians
were
in
the
question
the
old
man
smiled
and
said
wait
friend
there
ai
enough
yet
to
shoot
at
you
might
miss
by
this
time
we
had
learned
that
the
old
guide
wisdom
and
policy
had
saved
us
when
if
a
shot
had
been
fired
we
would
doubtless
have
been
destroyed
it
was
not
long
until
we
understood
his
meaning
we
saw
others
coming
in
tens
and
twenties
and
doing
as
the
first
had
done
till
they
formed
a
around
us
we
were
near
the
bank
of
the
river
our
rear
being
somewhat
protected
by
the
bank
and
width
of
the
stream
in
those
days
nothing
but
old
fashioned
kentucky
rifles
were
in
use
others
followed
till
they
were
several
files
deep
there
were
not
less
than
five
hundred
and
all
had
their
arms
ready
in
a
threatening
attitude
after
approaching
to
within
some
fifty
yards
of
camp
where
we
had
got
behind
logs
and
piled
up
our
packs
in
the
best
way
possible
for
defense
the
chief
with
a
few
others
rode
a
little
forward
and
in
a
loud
voice
made
known
his
wants
showing
us
his
warriors
with
arms
ready
demanding
that
we
at
once
should
submit
this
was
interpreted
to
the
captain
by
the
guide
the
captain
and
most
of
the
company
understood
spanish
i
thought
surely
our
day
had
come
and
so
did
many
others
but
all
felt
they
would
rather
die
fighting
than
to
cowardly
submit
to
such
an
arrogant
and
unreasonable
demand
the
captain
requested
the
chief
to
approach
nearer
saying
that
he
did
not
wish
any
trouble
and
desired
to
pass
through
the
country
in
peace
and
was
willing
to
respect
all
his
rights
at
this
the
chief
approached
and
finally
by
much
persuasion
he
got
off
his
horse
followed
by
a
few
others
the
main
body
keeping
their
places
in
stolid
silence
the
captain
carefully
passed
the
word
so
that
it
went
through
camp
that
if
shooting
had
to
be
done
he
would
open
the
ball
he
did
not
expect
them
to
attack
us
in
our
present
position
but
if
peace
could
not
be
made
he
intended
to
shoot
the
chief
down
it
was
about
two
when
this
commenced
the
parley
continued
until
near
sundown
before
peace
was
decided
upon
but
it
was
finally
concluded
after
agreeing
to
let
the
chief
have
some
beads
paints
tobacco
articles
we
had
for
the
purpose
of
making
treaties
in
those
days
before
the
white
men
taught
them
to
lie
and
betray
the
word
of
an
indian
was
sacred
not
so
now
the
moment
the
captain
spoke
telling
us
all
was
right
there
was
a
general
and
what
time
was
left
before
night
was
spent
in
trading
and
no
uneasiness
was
felt
by
any
of
the
company
for
all
had
perfect
confidence
in
the
word
of
the
indians
neither
were
we
deceived
during
the
parley
when
the
indians
found
they
could
not
obtain
a
man
the
next
thing
they
wanted
was
flour
they
were
told
we
had
none
to
spare
but
would
give
them
such
presents
as
have
already
been
mentioned
they
persisted
in
wanting
flour
we
were
getting
short
and
so
could
not
spare
any
while
the
debate
was
going
on
an
indian
went
and
got
his
blanket
full
of
good
dried
meat
rode
up
near
the
captain
who
was
sitting
down
and
threw
the
meat
on
to
him
saying
you
poor
hungry
dog
if
you
have
nothing
for
us
we
can
give
you
something
the
captain
took
it
coolly
and
thanked
him
for
it
when
they
found
they
could
get
nothing
more
they
accepted
the
presents
offered
some
may
ask
what
of
all
this
there
was
no
one
killed
nothing
of
a
blood
and
thunder
character
to
admire
i
will
say
to
such
just
stop
reading
this
book
for
it
is
not
of
the
blood
and
thunder
style
such
are
written
by
authors
who
have
never
seen
what
they
write
about
i
am
simply
telling
that
which
i
have
seen
known
of
and
taken
part
in
i
can
not
help
whether
it
pleases
or
not
i
can
only
tell
it
as
it
occurred
or
appeared
to
me
at
the
time
neither
do
i
make
any
allowance
for
lack
of
memory
anything
that
was
not
impressed
sufficiently
upon
my
mind
at
the
time
of
its
occurrence
so
as
to
remember
the
same
i
consider
not
worth
relating
i
have
had
some
close
calls
in
my
life
but
those
just
related
occupied
my
attention
about
as
closely
for
a
short
time
as
anything
that
ever
occurred
a
few
days
after
this
just
before
reaching
grand
river
we
came
very
near
opening
fire
on
another
party
of
indians
about
half
of
the
company
went
ahead
daily
as
a
front
guard
and
just
as
we
were
emerging
from
a
cedar
grove
the
guide
cried
out
now
we
have
to
fight
sure
there
comes
a
war
party
full
drive
for
fight
sure
enough
there
they
came
some
five
or
six
hundred
yards
away
out
of
a
ravine
on
to
a
rise
of
ground
some
three
hundred
yards
distant
we
dodged
back
into
the
cedars
every
man
taking
his
tree
the
indians
cautiously
approached
to
within
one
hundred
yards
there
being
a
few
scattering
cedars
in
their
direction
the
guide
took
them
for
navajoes
he
was
afraid
of
them
but
friendly
with
the
utes
as
the
indians
were
fully
in
earnest
and
seeking
to
get
an
advantage
we
were
about
to
commence
firing
to
try
and
pick
some
of
them
off
or
keep
them
back
until
the
rest
of
our
company
could
come
up
just
at
this
critical
moment
one
of
our
men
said
if
there
is
one
who
will
follow
me
i
will
go
out
and
make
friendly
signs
may
be
they
are
friends
i
felt
afraid
but
being
a
boy
i
wanted
to
appear
brave
so
i
told
him
i
would
go
we
went
out
to
an
opening
with
our
guns
ready
for
use
as
soon
as
the
indians
saw
us
they
called
out
friends
and
came
toward
us
making
friendly
signs
we
told
them
if
they
were
friends
to
stop
until
thomas
could
come
the
old
fellow
was
so
sure
they
were
hostile
navajoes
that
he
had
got
as
far
away
as
convenient
but
seeing
they
had
not
fired
on
us
he
picked
up
courage
and
came
to
where
we
stood
facing
the
indians
with
our
guns
aimed
at
them
mine
was
cocked
and
i
can
well
remember
placing
my
finger
on
the
trigger
several
times
with
dead
aim
at
the
one
i
supposed
to
be
the
chief
as
soon
as
old
thomas
showed
himself
there
was
a
big
laugh
all
around
at
the
mistake
they
having
mistaken
us
for
navajoes
the
same
as
we
did
them
they
were
on
the
war
path
hunting
navajoes
who
had
just
made
a
heavy
raid
upon
them
soon
all
was
well
as
these
indians
were
utes
and
friendly
with
the
guide
he
having
lived
with
this
same
band
several
years
these
were
the
same
indians
who
afterwards
broke
up
the
grand
valley
or
elk
mountain
settlement
during
the
excitement
after
the
indians
were
recognized
an
accidental
shot
was
fired
wounding
a
man
by
the
name
of
tattersall
severely
in
the
leg
this
came
near
starting
a
fight
as
many
thought
it
came
from
the
indians
i
am
satisfied
that
much
blood
has
been
shed
and
many
cruel
wars
brought
on
by
some
little
act
that
might
have
been
avoided
here
are
two
cases
within
a
few
days
that
seemed
certain
fight
and
to
fight
meant
certain
death
for
in
those
days
the
indians
were
ten
to
one
of
us
on
the
ground
and
plenty
more
to
come
i
now
come
to
the
place
where
my
whole
feelings
changed
toward
the
indians
and
as
the
accident
that
i
am
about
to
mention
seemingly
had
an
effect
on
my
future
life
i
will
beg
leave
to
write
freely
from
this
time
dates
my
friendship
for
the
red
man
which
many
think
so
strange
until
this
time
i
had
felt
about
the
same
as
my
associates
did
toward
the
natives
possibly
i
was
not
so
bitter
as
many
there
seems
to
be
something
providential
in
my
experience
so
far
in
never
having
had
to
fight
with
them
i
had
never
been
required
to
shed
their
blood
and
i
now
made
up
my
mind
i
never
would
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
about
the
middle
of
august
we
were
camped
on
green
river
not
far
from
where
the
denver
rio
grand
railway
now
crosses
it
i
shot
myself
accidentally
the
wound
was
one
of
the
most
dangerous
possible
not
to
prove
fatal
when
i
found
where
the
ball
had
entered
my
clothing
i
took
out
the
other
pistol
from
the
holster
with
the
intention
of
finishing
the
job
the
ball
had
struck
the
waist
button
of
my
pants
as
i
was
standing
by
the
side
of
my
mule
i
was
placing
the
pistol
in
the
holster
after
saddling
up
when
the
hammer
caught
on
the
edge
of
the
holster
pulling
it
back
slightly
when
it
slipped
and
went
off
the
ball
ranged
downward
entering
the
groin
and
thigh
passing
through
some
fourteen
inches
of
flesh
some
good
spirit
told
me
to
hold
on
that
i
would
live
almost
every
one
in
the
company
expressed
the
belief
that
i
would
die
we
were
about
to
cross
the
river
which
was
up
to
its
highest
mark
we
had
to
cross
on
rafts
made
of
half
decayed
cottonwood
logs
which
made
it
very
dangerous
i
suffered
terribly
during
the
day
once
having
the
lockjaw
i
could
hear
remarks
being
made
that
i
was
dying
when
i
rallied
enough
to
speak
the
first
use
i
made
of
my
tongue
was
to
give
all
a
good
cursing
telling
them
i
would
live
longer
than
any
such
a
set
who
were
so
willing
to
give
me
up
i
felt
at
the
time
that
i
would
try
and
live
just
for
spite
for
i
fully
realized
i
was
looked
upon
as
an
incumbrance
they
could
not
see
how
they
were
to
take
care
of
me
as
we
were
traveling
with
pack
animals
i
was
left
most
of
the
day
entirely
alone
all
hands
being
occupied
in
rafting
over
the
provisions
and
baggage
i
lay
in
the
shade
of
a
cottonwood
tree
thinking
that
my
companions
wanted
me
to
die
so
as
to
get
rid
of
bothering
with
me
i
was
some
distance
from
them
and
every
i
would
give
a
yell
just
to
let
them
know
that
i
was
not
dead
before
night
i
was
placed
on
a
raft
and
floated
over
to
camp
there
had
been
much
delay
in
crossing
and
it
was
found
that
at
this
rate
it
would
take
three
days
to
get
over
this
gave
some
hope
that
i
would
have
time
to
die
decently
and
the
company
would
have
no
further
trouble
with
me
only
to
care
for
me
while
i
remained
old
thomas
was
kind
to
me
and
felt
as
though
i
might
live
if
i
had
a
little
attention
there
was
a
camp
of
indians
of
tabby
band
not
far
from
us
my
old
friend
the
guide
went
and
told
the
indians
about
me
saying
i
was
his
boy
an
expression
that
means
a
great
deal
among
the
indians
meaning
that
i
was
the
same
as
a
son
to
him
in
friendship
the
indians
came
both
men
and
women
and
i
can
never
forget
their
expression
of
sympathy
or
their
looks
of
kindness
they
offered
to
take
me
and
try
to
cure
me
this
seemed
to
stir
up
the
feelings
of
some
of
my
companions
and
they
began
to
discuss
the
possibility
of
taking
me
along
finally
a
few
of
the
kindest
hearted
determined
to
try
it
so
a
rig
was
gotten
up
and
old
thomas
advised
me
to
endeavor
to
get
to
the
mormon
settlements
telling
me
about
their
goodness
and
that
if
i
could
reach
them
they
would
care
for
me
i
felt
almost
disappointed
not
to
go
with
the
indians
for
my
heart
was
melted
toward
them
and
i
felt
as
though
i
could
always
be
their
friend
and
trust
them
and
i
can
truly
say
that
this
feeling
has
ever
remained
with
me
i
felt
to
be
guided
by
the
old
man
for
his
judgment
was
generally
good
and
i
knew
him
to
be
a
true
friend
his
description
of
the
mormons
seemed
strange
to
me
and
i
told
him
they
were
a
bad
people
who
had
been
driven
out
from
the
states
because
they
were
thieves
and
murderers
and
that
for
their
bad
conduct
they
were
banished
from
decent
people
his
reply
astonished
me
he
asked
how
can
you
say
that
there
is
not
one
word
true
i
traveled
with
the
mormon
soldiers
from
santa
fe
to
california
they
never
stole
anything
from
the
settlements
like
the
other
soldiers
did
the
mormons
are
honest
and
have
no
bad
habits
like
other
people
i
came
back
with
some
of
them
to
salt
lake
and
remained
there
last
winter
i
traded
with
the
indians
and
mormons
and
lived
with
them
the
mormons
have
no
harlots
or
bad
people
among
them
and
all
those
stories
are
lies
why
do
you
speak
so
about
them
the
old
fellow
seemed
terribly
offended
at
my
words
i
felt
there
was
something
wrong
i
told
him
i
knew
nothing
about
the
mormons
that
i
had
only
told
him
what
others
said
he
replied
then
wait
and
see
for
yourself
they
are
the
best
people
you
ever
saw
this
caused
me
to
reflect
and
wonder
why
such
stories
were
told
of
the
mormons
for
i
not
only
had
confidence
in
the
old
guide
truthfulness
but
i
believed
he
had
been
with
the
people
enough
to
know
them
a
frame
was
made
and
placed
upon
the
back
of
a
good
stout
mule
the
foundation
being
a
mexican
apparejo
i
had
to
sit
entirely
above
the
mule
as
the
wound
would
not
allow
to
sit
in
a
saddle
this
made
the
load
the
trail
from
green
river
down
spanish
fork
canyon
was
quite
rough
and
steep
in
many
places
guy
ropes
were
rigged
and
three
men
took
care
of
me
and
i
must
say
that
after
taking
the
labor
in
hand
to
bring
me
in
all
hands
became
interested
and
i
was
treated
with
great
kindness
i
suffered
a
great
deal
during
the
fifteen
days
i
thus
journeyed
but
i
never
lost
courage
our
drives
were
short
sometimes
being
two
days
in
a
camp
engaged
in
cutting
roads
through
the
brush
for
the
sheep
to
pass
this
gave
me
a
chance
to
rest
i
attended
to
my
wound
myself
as
i
could
not
bear
anyone
else
to
touch
it
neither
would
i
take
any
one
advice
about
dressing
it
i
felt
like
being
my
own
doctor
i
have
always
believed
that
if
i
had
been
in
a
good
hospital
i
would
have
been
done
for
as
the
wound
was
terrible
i
starved
myself
almost
to
death
an
idea
obtained
from
two
men
experience
in
southern
arizona
these
two
men
green
marshall
and
robert
ward
left
santa
fe
with
a
party
going
to
california
by
the
southern
trail
close
by
where
silver
city
now
is
the
party
was
attacked
as
supposed
by
apache
indians
all
were
left
for
dead
the
surprise
occurred
early
in
the
morning
about
noon
marshall
and
ward
recovered
consciousness
they
were
stripped
and
both
wounded
in
several
places
and
almost
perishing
for
water
they
being
in
a
dry
camp
they
started
for
water
and
after
going
a
short
distance
they
separated
each
in
time
finding
water
but
they
never
met
until
reaching
settlements
according
to
the
account
given
by
each
of
them
on
arriving
at
the
mexican
settlements
they
were
out
some
twelve
days
with
scarcely
anything
to
eat
each
one
supposing
the
other
dead
and
it
was
several
days
before
they
heard
of
each
other
having
come
into
settlements
that
were
some
distance
apart
the
wounds
of
each
had
seemingly
dried
up
and
healed
for
the
want
of
something
to
feed
on
i
was
well
acquainted
with
both
men
one
being
a
relative
i
took
much
interest
in
their
case
as
it
was
one
of
the
worst
on
record
i
felt
like
trying
as
much
as
possible
the
same
regime
and
believe
to
this
day
in
case
of
severe
wounds
that
the
system
should
be
reduced
by
abstinence
to
the
lowest
possible
living
condition
nature
so
directs
many
of
the
lower
animal
creation
i
have
known
some
domestic
animals
as
well
as
wild
ones
that
on
being
dangerously
wounded
would
hide
up
for
days
without
food
or
drink
and
come
out
well
in
time
finally
on
the
of
september
we
came
in
sight
of
a
settlement
then
a
fort
on
the
provo
river
this
surprised
us
considerably
for
we
had
not
expected
to
meet
anyone
before
reaching
salt
lake
city
i
shall
never
forget
the
peculiar
feelings
that
came
over
me
when
we
arrived
at
the
fort
the
little
party
with
me
had
become
separated
from
the
main
company
while
coming
down
spanish
fork
canyon
and
we
were
considerably
behind
when
we
saw
signs
of
settlements
we
felt
somewhat
uneasy
for
fear
the
bad
mormons
would
take
advantage
of
us
and
rob
us
as
we
had
some
money
when
the
company
of
fifty
were
all
together
we
felt
as
though
we
could
stand
the
mormons
off
but
the
four
of
us
counting
myself
i
wounded
and
weak
feared
we
might
be
taken
in
i
had
my
pistols
by
me
and
told
the
boys
i
would
do
my
best
if
molested
when
we
got
to
the
fort
instead
of
trouble
we
found
the
people
with
about
the
same
kindly
look
of
the
eye
and
expression
of
sympathy
as
was
manifested
by
the
indians
on
green
river
there
are
many
now
living
in
provo
who
remember
the
circumstance
and
how
i
looked
a
mere
skeleton
sitting
on
the
top
of
a
mule
the
indians
also
remember
me
to
this
day
from
these
circumstances
and
call
me
chacon
boy
i
now
felt
conquered
as
far
as
mormon
goodness
was
concerned
for
many
offered
me
help
if
needed
i
was
at
first
tempted
to
accept
their
kind
offers
but
a
spirit
of
pride
came
over
me
it
seemed
humiliating
to
receive
a
favor
under
any
circumstances
so
i
went
into
camp
with
the
rest
i
was
now
out
of
danger
my
wound
having
done
well
but
the
position
in
which
i
had
to
ride
had
set
the
muscles
so
that
crawling
on
hands
and
knees
was
my
only
means
of
moving
about
still
i
had
not
lost
my
spirits
i
had
started
to
california
to
get
rich
and
did
not
want
to
fail
the
mormons
often
visited
our
camp
selling
us
butter
vegetables
and
such
supplies
as
they
had
to
spare
owing
to
the
conflicting
stories
i
had
heard
about
them
i
watched
them
very
closely
some
of
our
company
were
missouri
mobocrats
who
told
hard
stories
about
the
mormons
these
they
related
to
me
as
though
they
were
their
own
personal
experiences
with
them
some
of
these
men
i
had
known
for
years
and
looked
upon
them
as
men
of
truth
and
honor
how
then
could
i
help
believing
their
stories
and
yet
how
could
i
believe
people
to
be
such
monsters
of
iniquity
as
the
mormons
must
have
been
if
these
stories
were
true
when
looking
at
their
friendly
eyes
and
hearing
their
voices
of
sympathy
i
could
see
nothing
that
indicated
depravity
but
on
the
contrary
all
seemed
industrious
kind
honest
and
peaceable
ever
ready
to
do
us
a
favor
or
give
any
wanted
information
frankly
without
any
show
of
craftiness
whatever
to
this
day
it
is
a
mystery
to
me
how
anyone
can
call
the
mormon
people
crafty
and
dishonest
that
individuals
among
us
may
be
is
too
true
but
as
a
people
we
have
a
right
to
be
judged
collectively
let
each
person
answer
for
himself
i
was
sorely
perplexed
but
each
day
induced
a
more
friendly
feeling
toward
the
mormons
as
yet
i
had
never
heard
a
word
of
their
doctrine
or
history
not
even
having
heard
of
joseph
smith
martyrdom
in
fact
i
knew
nothing
about
them
one
of
our
company
who
boasted
of
his
cruel
exploits
in
missouri
went
up
to
the
fort
and
under
the
guise
of
friendship
procured
a
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
from
a
sister
higbee
to
read
and
make
sport
of
there
were
a
number
listening
and
ridiculing
the
book
i
was
some
distance
away
lying
alone
in
the
shade
i
though
i
might
enjoy
the
fun
with
the
rest
and
crawled
up
nearer
when
i
got
within
hearing
distance
something
was
being
read
about
god
revealing
himself
telling
certain
ones
what
to
do
this
had
a
peculiar
effect
on
my
mind
my
prayer
asking
for
this
very
thing
came
to
my
mind
i
had
heard
but
very
little
of
their
reading
for
just
as
i
came
within
hearing
distance
some
one
took
the
book
from
the
mobocrat
and
read
the
account
of
joseph
and
hyrum
martyrdom
on
hearing
this
i
believe
i
felt
just
as
the
saints
did
when
they
first
heard
of
the
murder
of
the
prophets
at
carthage
the
feeling
that
came
upon
me
at
that
time
was
that
they
were
men
of
god
and
were
murdered
by
wicked
men
just
as
it
was
there
recorded
at
once
the
desire
came
over
me
to
get
away
from
those
who
were
exulting
over
their
death
and
deriding
the
revelations
that
i
thought
might
be
true
so
i
determined
to
stop
and
see
who
the
mormons
were
i
asked
the
first
teamster
that
passed
to
take
me
to
the
fort
about
two
miles
distant
as
i
wished
to
see
if
i
could
find
some
one
to
take
care
of
me
after
being
helped
on
the
wagon
the
owner
thomas
ross
asked
me
a
few
questions
then
remarked
you
had
better
remain
in
utah
my
son
and
you
will
soon
be
a
mormon
this
seemed
strange
to
me
for
according
to
my
idea
he
might
as
well
have
said
you
will
be
a
chinaman
i
asked
how
that
could
possibly
be
he
replied
by
obedience
to
the
gospel
and
baptism
i
asked
if
the
mormons
had
a
religion
he
said
yes
the
same
that
christ
taught
we
believe
in
the
new
testament
i
replied
that
is
what
i
believe
but
i
believe
it
as
it
reads
well
said
he
that
is
what
we
think
i
guess
you
be
a
mormon
yet
this
was
something
new
to
me
and
i
was
continually
asking
myself
how
can
i
be
a
mormon
on
arriving
at
the
fort
i
went
to
bishop
isaac
higbee
house
where
i
was
kindly
received
his
wife
agreeing
to
care
for
me
on
reasonable
terms
she
is
now
living
in
salt
lake
city
and
has
ever
been
a
friend
to
me
i
went
back
to
camp
and
bade
to
my
old
friends
and
associates
determined
that
i
would
stay
and
see
for
myself
and
if
mormonism
was
what
they
said
it
was
i
would
go
no
further
for
all
the
gold
in
california
since
i
was
ten
years
old
i
had
believed
there
was
something
before
me
worth
living
for
and
that
god
would
eventually
answer
my
prayers
and
let
me
know
how
to
serve
him
i
often
wonder
why
i
am
not
more
faithful
and
if
i
will
ever
learn
to
do
as
i
should
much
of
my
life
seems
to
have
been
governed
by
circumstances
over
which
i
have
had
but
little
control
that
is
i
have
been
impelled
by
influences
that
urged
me
on
to
certain
labors
especially
among
the
indians
which
i
have
felt
compelled
to
answer

my
scrutiny
of
the
mormons
employment
as
an
indian
trader
acquaintance
with

mormons
a
proposition
of
theft
loomas
threatens
my
life
my
resolve
to
kill
him
he
finds
his
death
at
other
hands
after
settling
myself
with
the
bishop
family
i
soon
got
so
that
i
could
hobble
around
a
little
everyone
was
kind
and
treated
me
with
great
confidence
i
listened
to
the
elders
preaching
and
soon
concluded
they
were
honest
and
knew
it
or
were
willful
liars
and
deceivers
i
was
determined
if
possible
not
to
be
fooled
therefore
i
commenced
to
watch
very
closely
i
soon
found
that
the
people
took
an
interest
in
the
indians
and
although
they
had
been
at
war
and
the
bishop
son
had
been
killed
by
them
there
was
no
general
feeling
of
bitterness
the
indians
were
around
the
fort
more
or
less
and
the
people
were
desirous
of
friendship
after
i
had
been
there
a
few
weeks
recruiting
patrick
and
glenn
came
to
provo
they
were
traders
on
their
way
south
to
barter
with
the
indians
and
whites
they
knew
nothing
about
trading
with
the
indians
something
i
had
learned
considerable
about
from
old
thomas
who
had
traded
with
them
during
our
trip
i
had
also
dealt
with
them
while
in
new
mexico
this
firm
offered
me
employment
for
the
winter
to
go
to
sanpete
valley
then
the
head
quarters
for
trading
with
the
ute
indians
this
suited
me
for
i
wished
to
become
better
acquainted
with
the
indians
and
gain
their
friendship
also
to
learn
their
language
some
of
them
could
speak
more
or
less
spanish
but
not
enough
to
converse
satisfactorily
while
in
manti
during
the
winter
i
boarded
with
father
isaac
morley
during
the
winter
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
dimick
huntington
he
told
me
about
the
book
of
mormon
its
relationship
to
the
indians
etc
it
seemed
natural
to
me
to
believe
it
i
can
not
remember
ever
questioning
in
my
mind
the
truthfulness
of
the
book
of
mormon
or
that
joseph
smith
was
a
prophet
the
question
was
are
the
mormons
sincere
and
can
i
be
one
i
heard
a
great
many
hard
remarks
about
the
missourians
and
being
one
myself
i
felt
to
resent
the
wholesale
accusations
made
against
them
about
that
time
a
great
many
dead
beats
and
winter
mormons
joined
the
church
emigrants
who
stopped
over
simply
for
convenience
quite
a
number
came
to
manti
led
by
one
loomas
they
all
joined
the
church
they
tried
to
induce
me
to
be
baptized
when
they
were
i
gave
them
a
good
cursing
for
being
miserable
hypocrites
at
which
they
only
laughed
saying
they
would
have
the
advantage
of
me
among
the
girls
at
least
sometime
near
spring
this
gang
arranged
to
make
a
general
raid
upon
the
settlements
and
steal
all
the
horses
upon
the
range
from
draperville
going
south
through
utah
valley
in
those
days
numerous
herds
of
horses
ran
loose
as
the
range
was
good
the
gang
of
outlaws
had
confederates
in
salt
lake
city
where
some
of
them
robbed
a
jeweler
store
they
sent
for
me
one
night
and
laid
their
plans
before
me
they
proposed
that
i
would
be
their
guide
and
meet
them
at
the
head
of
spanish
fork
canyon
conduct
them
through
to
new
mexico
and
have
of
all
the
horses
i
declined
the
offer
telling
them
it
was
a
good
speculation
assigning
as
my
reason
for
not
going
that
i
had
not
sufficiently
recovered
from
my
wounds
to
risk
the
trip
this
they
seemed
to
believe
as
i
was
yet
somewhat
lame
they
made
me
promise
not
to
betray
them
and
i
soon
satisfied
them
on
that
point
i
realized
my
awkward
situation
but
was
determined
to
warn
the
people
thus
putting
them
on
their
guard
accordingly
on
going
to
provo
i
informed
the
bishop
of
their
plans
he
warned
the
different
settlements
and
without
any
fuss
the
people
were
put
on
their
guard
these
men
were
closely
watched
until
spring
when
they
all
left
for
lower
california
most
of
them
going
about
the
time
of
the
move
to
san
bernardino
in
a
fit
of
anger
a
friend
of
loomas
told
me
i
would
get
killed
some
day
that
loomas
was
on
my
track
it
is
true
i
had
in
a
measure
betrayed
him
and
his
companions
still
i
had
felt
it
my
duty
to
do
as
i
had
done
and
to
prevent
myself
being
killed
i
resolved
to
kill
him
on
sight
so
intent
was
i
on
this
that
i
came
near
shooting
another
party
that
i
mistook
for
loomas
at
this
time
i
was
camped
at
spanish
fork
as
i
was
returning
from
a
hunt
i
saw
a
person
sitting
with
his
back
toward
me
that
in
every
way
resembled
loomas
in
point
of
size
and
peculiarity
of
dress
loomas
was
expected
to
visit
us
i
approached
with
my
gun
ready
greatly
tempted
to
shoot
without
speaking
as
he
was
also
armed
but
thinking
this
cowardly
i
spoke
in
order
to
draw
his
attention
when
on
his
turning
round
another
face
presented
itself
as
it
turned
out
no
one
knew
of
my
intentions
but
myself
it
makes
me
shudder
even
now
when
i
think
of
my
intentions
and
feelings
at
that
time
i
never
saw
any
of
the
gang
afterwards
but
read
an
account
of
loomas
and
others
being
lynched
for
robbery
in
california
my
feelings
at
this
time
were
very
conflicting
i
became
fully
convinced
of
the
truth
of
mormonism
and
that
it
was
my
duty
to
obey
but
i
tried
to
excuse
myself
in
many
ways
i
said
nothing
to
anyone
but
kept
up
a
terrible
thinking
being
a
missourian
it
seemed
from
the
remarks
made
even
in
public
that
salvation
could
never
reach
me
i
remembered
that
my
father
always
opposed
mobocracy
so
much
so
that
he
was
called
by
some
of
our
neighbors
a
mormon
i
was
too
proud
to
mention
this
to
anyone
i
knew
i
was
honest
and
was
not
to
blame
for
being
born

missouri

tricks
the

extinction
of
the
tribe
during
the
winter
i
made
several
trips
to
salt
lake
city
in
company
with
patrick
one
of
the
firm
in
whose
employ
i
was
the
winter
was
very
cold
we
were
glad
to
get
under
shelter
no
matter
how
poor
it
was
at
that
time
there
were
few
settlements
from
salt
lake
city
to
manti
the
first
was
at
willow
creek
ebenezer
brown
farm
then
provo
the
first
house
in
american
fork
was
built
in
by
matt
caldwell
a
bitter
cold
night
brought
four
of
us
to
this
humble
abode
made
of
unhewn
cottonwood
logs
where
we
were
kindly
greeted
and
housed
for
the
night
beyond
provo
stewart
erected
the
first
cabin
at
peteteneet
creek
which
place
is
now
known
as
payson
from
there
on
there
were
no
settlements
until
manti
was
reached
about
this
time
i
commenced
to
consider
whether
it
would
not
be
best
for
me
to
go
on
to
california
make
a
lot
of
money
then
return
and
join
the
saints
arguing
that
they
would
have
more
confidence
in
me
then
than
if
i
should
join
now
as
i
knew
that
winter
mormons
were
looked
upon
with
suspicion
my
mind
was
much
occupied
in
trying
to
determine
what
was
best
after
considering
well
the
prejudices
i
would
have
to
meet
i
finally
spoke
to
father
morley
who
baptized
me
january
there
was
over
a
foot
of
ice
on
the
water
at
the
time
when
i
spoke
to
brother
morley
about
baptizing
me
he
was
just
starting
out
after
a
load
of
wood
with
his
ax
under
his
arm
he
replied
i
am
ready
here
is
my
ax
to
cut
the
ice
i
have
been
expecting
this
for
some
time
i
wondered
why
he
expected
it
as
i
had
said
nothing
about
my
intentions
after
baptism
i
felt
more
at
ease
although
i
knew
many
doubted
my
sincerity
this
made
no
difference
as
long
as
i
knew
i
was
sincere
i
made
quite
an
acquaintance
with
the
indians
during
the
winter
walker
and
portions
of
his
band
came
around
occasionally
to
trade
they
were
a
fine
race
of
people
walker
life
and
exploits
with
his
band
would
fill
a
volume
he
was
sometimes
called
the
napoleon
of
the
desert
being
a
great
strategist
often
those
he
had
to
meet
in
war
or
whom
he
designed
to
plunder
he
often
made
raids
into
lower
california
robbing
the
people
and
bringing
away
large
herds
of
their
best
horses
always
laying
his
plans
with
great
skill
so
as
to
not
lose
his
men
one
of
these
trips
made
by
him
in
i
think
shows
his
ability
with
about
of
his
most
venturesome
braves
he
went
down
as
usual
the
mexicans
were
expecting
them
and
their
best
horses
were
corralled
nightly
their
picked
saddle
horses
valued
so
highly
by
every
mexican
gentleman
were
kept
in
stables
under
guard
walker
and
party
succeeded
in
cutting
an
opening
in
the
rear
of
the
corral
turning
out
the
stock
and
getting
away
with
them
this
time
the
mexicans
were
determined
to
follow
them
into
the
desert
make
a
good
killing
and
recover
their
stock
they
had
not
expected
such
a
bold
move
as
cutting
into
the
corral
but
as
soon
as
it
was
discovered
the
mexicans
started
in
hot
pursuit
walker
pushed
on
with
all
speed
passing
a
spring
where
he
calculated
the
mexicans
would
make
a
short
halt
here
he
left
fifteen
of
his
men
afoot
secreted
near
the
spring
soon
the
mexicans
arrived
having
ridden
hard
for
some
distance
as
walker
expected
they
were
soon
unsaddled
their
horses
tied
out
to
grass
and
all
hands
asleep
expecting
to
take
an
hour
rest
and
then
go
on
the
indians
waited
till
all
were
settled
then
quietly
loosened
the
horses
each
one
mounted
some
taking
the
lead
while
others
drove
the
loose
animals
after
reaching
a
safe
distance
from
gunshot
they
gave
a
loud
whoop
and
started
to
run
i
have
seen
them
in
mimicry
go
through
the
whole
performance
showing
how
the
mexicans
looked
when
they
realized
the
situation
the
indians
always
claimed
that
there
was
nothing
hostile
in
this
as
they
killed
no
one
at
the
present
time
i
do
not
know
of
one
representative
of
this
once
powerful
band
walker
could
meet
and
his
indian
foes
and
outwit
the
mexicans
in
fact
hold
his
own
with
almost
anyone
whom
he
met
but
neither
he
nor
his
band
could
stand
fine
flour
and
good
living
this
finally
more
than
anything
else
conquered
them
i
sometimes
wonder
if
the
saints
have
done
their
duty
toward
these
indians
professing
as
we
do
that
they
are
of
the
seed

chapter
patrick
and
glenn
fail
patrick
a
rascal
he
robs
enoch
reece
i
remained
in
manti
until
april
when
i
still
in
the
employ
of
patrick
and
glenn
came
down
to
spanish
fork
and
helped
to
open
the
first
farm
on
that
stream
it
was
known
as
the
reece
farm
here
we
had
many
utes
about
us
i
often
traded
with
them
and
they
were
always
friendly
remarking
that
i
had
a
different
expression
in
my
eyes
a
more
kindly
look
than
the
people
in
general
had
for
them
the
fact
is
i
felt
from
the
depths
of
my
heart
sincere
friendship
for
them
and
no
doubt
manifested
it
in
my
looks
my
employers
had
failed
in
business
having
no
capital
to
commence
with
and
turned
over
their
property
to
the
reece
brothers
of
salt
lake
city
patrick
proved
to
be
a
rascal
when
i
called
on
him
for
a
settlement
he
denied
the
most
he
was
owing
me
he
was
then
in
provo
in
charge
of
several
thousand
dollars
worth
of
stock
belonging
to
enoch
reece
who
was
sending
him
out
to
meet
his
train
of
merchandise
coming
in
he
was
to
meet
it
at
green
river
i
was
determined
to
make
him
pay
me
before
he
went
on
finally
he
offered
to
settle
by
arbitration
naming
a
person
i
felt
safe
with
this
proposal
and
asked
him
if
he
would
abide
the
decision
if
i
would
he
answered
yes
i
felt
sure
of
the
money
for
i
had
great
confidence
in
the
person
chosen
he
seemed
a
just
and
good
man
and
in
my
simplicity
i
supposed
he
would
be
able
to
judge
correctly
in
the
case
i
was
careful
not
to
make
any
demand
excepting
what
i
knew
to
be
perfectly
just
patrick
denied
in
toto
my
account
and
the
arbitrator
decided
that
i
was
attempting
to
wrong
patrick
this
was
a
stumper
for
me
but
i
said
i
would
stand
it
and
inasmuch
as
i
had
to
pay
for
the
privilege
i
intended
to
tell
all
hands
what
i
thought
of
them
i
then
told
the
arbitrator
that
he
had
believed
a
lie
and
condemned
the
truth
that
some
day
he
would
know
it
and
that
patrick
would
get
away
with
brother
reece
property
for
he
had
proven
himself
a
thief
enoch
reece
was
present
and
resented
what
i
said
telling
me
to
stop
talking
but
i
made
my
little
speech
all
the
same
about
six
weeks
afterwards
i
met
brother
reece
in
provo
and
the
first
words
he
said
to
me
were
well
brother
jones
what
do
you
think
has
occurred
i
replied
patrick
has
got
away
with
your
stock
yes
said
he
he
has
sold
the
whole
of
it
and
for
oregon
i
told
him
i
was
glad
of
it
for
he
might
have
listened
to
me
i
also
learned
afterwards
what
had
blinded
the
arbitrator
he
was
owing
patrick
some
five
hundred
dollars
and
the
latter
had
told
him
he
could
wait
six
months
for
all
except
what
was
owing
jones
so
all
that
was
decided
in
my
favor
he
had
to
look
up
consequently
it
was
easy
to
understand
why
patrick
did
not
owe
me
much
i
had
not
belonged
to
the
church
long
but
if
any
one
had
hinted
to
me
that
my
faith
was
shaken
in
mormonism
by
this
unjust
decision
i
should
have
resented
it
as
an
insult
to
me
it
was
simply
a
human
weakness
which
mormonism
had
nothing
to
do
with

seemed
anxious
saying
he
could
find
no
one
and
that
his
wheat
was
going
to
waste
i
told
him
i
would
help
him
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
then
said
he
wanted
a
man
who
could
follow
him
and
rake
and
bind
what
he
cut
i
replied
that
i
could
do
it
still
looking
at
me
he
commenced
laughing
and
said
well
you
will
have
to
change
your
clothing
anyway
my
friend
then
introduced
me
to
edmund
ellsworth
president
young
and
told
him
i
was
a
good
worker
brother
ellsworth
told
me
to
get
ready
and
come
on
i
soon
changed
to
buckskin
pants
and
hickory
shirt
and
returned
he
remarked
you
will
do
now
i
had
never
till
this
time
thought
dress
made
any
difference
in
a
looks
in
regard
to
work
we
finished
up
the
wheat
and
returned
to
town
on
saturday
after
supper
brother
ellsworth
said
we
will
now
go
and
see
brother
brigham
who
lives
opposite
in
the
white
house
i
asked
him
to
wait
until
i
changed
my
clothes
this
he
would
not
allow
but
insisted
i
should
go
as
i
was
adding
that
brother
brigham
did
not
judge
a
man
by
his
dress
i
went
and
can
say
i
was
completely
won
by
president
young
manner
he
asked
me
a
great
many
questions
and
i
was
satisfied
that
he
did
not
doubt
my
sincerity
he
gave
me
a
note
to
brother
joseph
young
directing
him
to
ordain
me
a
seventy
saying
that
he
wanted
me
to
preach
the
gospel
wherever
i
had
an
opportunity
especially
to
the
people
speaking
the
spanish
language
i
went
and
was
ordained
september
by
joseph
young
i
remained
in
the
city
some
time
boarding
with
brother
ellsworth
i
was
present
at
the
meeting
where
judge
brochus
delivered
his
famous
speech
in
which
he
applied
to
the
women
of
utah
for
a
block
for
the
washington
monument
telling
them
that
before
they
contributed
to
so
glorious
a
work
they
must
become
virtuous
and
teach
their
daughters
to
become
so
i
sat
and
listened
looking
at
brother
brigham
who
sat
perfectly
still
with
his
mouth
twisted
a
little
to
one
side
beginning
to
lose
my
respect
for
him
and
mormons
generally
i
spoke
to
a
man
sitting
next
to
me
brother
everett
telling
him
i
would
not
allow
such
talk
if
i
had
a
wife
or
mother
there
that
i
would
kick
brochus
out
of
the
stand
brother
everett
being
more
patient
told
me
to
wait
when
brother
brigham
arose
and
answered
brochus
i
understood
why
nothing
had
been
said
to
interfere
with
his
speech
brochus
was
given
full
liberty
to
empty
himself
then
he
got
his
dose
which
so
frightened
him
that
he
and
his
companions
left
for
the
states
in
a
few
days
no
one
threatened
him
or
his
associates
but
he
was
simply
told
what
he
was
and
who
the
people
were
that
listened
to
his
abuse
this
did
him
up
entirely
chapter

the

fe
traditions
concerning
it
the
early
settlers
my
desires
to
travel
the
slave
trade
i
returned
to
provo
after
the
october
conference
soon
after
my
return
a
large
party
of
mexican
traders
from
new
mexico
arrived
in
utah
and
camped
near
by
they
came
in
on
their
usual
trading
business
the
main
object
being
to
buy
indian
children
for
slaves
that
the
reader
may
more
fully
understand
the
situation
i
will
give
a
little
of
the
history
and
customs
of
new
mexico
santa
fe
is
one
of
the
oldest
cities
in
the
united
states
the
correct
history
is
not
perfectly
known
but
the
one
told
by
the
natives
and
generally
accepted
is
that
soon
after
the
conquest
of
mexico
by
cortez
an
expedition
went
out
to
explore
the
northern
country
nothing
was
heard
from
them
and
all
trace
was
lost
until
a
number
of
years
afterwards
when
another
party
went
north
on
arriving
at
santa
fe
they
found
a
people
among
whom
many
of
the
younger
ones
spoke
the
spanish
language
they
found
after
much
trouble
and
enquiry
that
these
were
children
of
the
former
explorers
who
on
arriving
in
that
country
had
found
rich
mines
of
gold
and
silver
they
concluded
to
keep
silent
and
work
these
mines
for
themselves
they
also
found
the
natives
peaceable
and
in
every
way
well
disposed
toward
them
these
natives
lived
in
towns
and
cultivated
the
soil
the
spaniards
took
wives
from
among
the
natives
and
all
went
well
until
the
spaniards
had
accumulated
many
millions
of
dollars
when
they
began
to
tire
of
their
friends
and
families
and
longed
for
the
more
congenial
society
of
the
people
they
had
left
believing
that
with
their
great
wealth
they
would
be
received
with
honor
consequently
they
determined
to
abandon
all
their
new
made
friends
and
return
to
old
mexico
the
natives
remonstrated
for
they
now
looked
upon
them
as
a
part
of
their
tribe
inasmuch
as
they
had
given
them
wives
and
homes
and
had
assisted
and
protected
them
in
every
way
the
spaniards
had
made
them
believe
that
they
were
directed
by
the
great
spirit
to
come
among
them
and
be
united
with
them
so
when
they
proposed
leaving
the
natives
looked
upon
them
as
deceivers
and
forbade
their
departure
the
spaniards
heeded
not
their
warnings
and
felt
no
apprehensions
for
the
natives
were
not
a
warlike
people
so
with
their
treasure
they
started
south
but
were
attacked
and
all
killed
tradition
says
that
their
treasure
is
buried
in
a
plain
near
a
salt
lake
south
of
santa
fe
that
there
is
more
or
less
truth
in
all
this
can
not
be
doubted
for
history
tells
us
that
the
second
party
found
descendants
of
these
former
explorers
in
santa
fe
where
they
had
built
quite
a
village
and
worked
mines
in
fact
much
evidence
was
found
to
corroborate
the
statement
of
the
natives
although
no
records
were
found
and
not
one
of
the
original
spaniards
was
living
the
second
party
remained
and
reported
themselves
to
the
government
of
mexico
others
came
and
strengthened
the
colony
the
mines
were
worked
yielding
immense
wealth
the
catholic
church
was
established
among
the
natives
the
spaniards
taking
indian
women
for
wives
the
natives
became
converted
and
adopted
spanish
civilization
mixed
with
their
own
traditions
a
new
class
of
people
commonly
called
spanish
mexicans
was
the
result
a
few
of
the
natives
retained
their
ancient
customs
remaining
apart
and
never
mixing
with
others
many
of
these
can
still
be
found
living
in
towns
and
villages
along
the
rio
grande
they
are
known
as
pueblos
and
are
much
more
honest
and
moral
than
the
mixed
race
new
mexico
was
almost
an
unknown
country
to
the
people
of
the
united
states
until
the
last
half
century
many
of
the
pioneer
traders
to
that
land
were
from
howard
county
missouri
where
i
was
born
and
i
remember
when
a
child
hearing
numbers
of
them
on
their
return
recount
their
exploits
and
strange
experiences
i
felt
as
if
i
could
not
wait
to
be
a
man
before
going
to
see
these
strange
countries
and
peoples
well
do
i
remember
when
studying
geography
at
school
and
seeing
unexplored
region
marked
on
the
map
feeling
a
contempt
for
the
author
and
thinking
if
i
were
a
man
i
would
go
and
see
what
there
was
in
that
land
and
not
mark
it
unexplored
these
new
mexicans
were
a
venturesome
people
they
penetrated
through
to
california
trails
were
opened
that
were
a
marvel
of
pioneering
they
were
doubtless
assisted
by
the
natives
the
jesuits
were
leaders
in
most
of
these
moves
there
is
hardly
a
tribe
of
indians
in
the
rocky
mountains
but
what
has
a
tradition
of
the
priests
having
been
among
them
sometimes
these
priests
gained
quite
an
influence
with
the
wild
tribes
at
one
time
the
uintahs
were
their
friends
but
a
break
occurred
and
the
priests
were
killed
thus
we
find
that
the
people
of
new
mexico
at
the
time
i
am
writing
of
them
in
were
making
annual
trips
commencing
with
a
few
goods
trading
on
their
way
with
either
navajoes
or
utes
generally
with
the
navajoes
for
horses
which
they
sold
very
cheap
always
retaining
their
best
ones
these
horses
were
brought
through
and
traded
to
the
poorer
indians
for
children
the
horses
were
often
used
for
food
this
trading
was
continued
into
lower
california
where
the
children
bought
on
the
down
trip
would
be
traded
to
the
for
other
horses
goods
or
cash
many
times
a
small
outfit
on
the
start
would
return
with
large
herds
of
california
stock
all
children
bought
on
the
return
trip
would
be
taken
back
to
new
mexico
and
then
sold
boys
fetching
on
an
average
girls
from
to
the
girls
were
in
demand
to
bring
up
for
house
servants
having
the
reputation
of
making
better
servants
than
any
others
this
slave
trade
gave
rise
to
the
cruel
wars
between
the
native
tribes
of
this
country
from
salt
lake
down
to
the
tribes
in
southern
utah
walker
and
his
band
raided
on
the
weak
tribes
taking
their
children
prisoners
and
selling
them
to
the
mexicans
many
of
the
lower
classes
inhabiting
the
southern
deserts
would
sell
their
own
children
for
a
horse
and
kill
and
eat
the
horse
the
mexicans
were
as
fully
established
and
systematic
in
this
trade
as
ever
were
the
slavers
on
the
seas
and
to
them
it
was
a
very
lucrative
business

the

trade
the
prosecution
of
offenders
a
noted
trial
a
cruel
argument
to
induce
mormons
to
buy
indian
children
at
this
time
brigham
young
was
governor
of
utah
and
had
the
oversight
of
indian
affairs
some
little
business
in
the
slave
trade
had
been
done
on
the
trip
the
summer
before
by
our
old
guide
who
was
a
regular
trader
governor
young
asked
me
something
about
this
business
telling
me
to
look
out
and
if
any
of
these
traders
came
in
to
let
him
know
as
the
laws
of
the
united
states
which
then
extended
over
this
territory
prohibited
this
business
and
that
it
would
be
his
duty
to
put
a
stop
to
the
same
he
hoped
to
do
this
by
advising
these
traders
in
regard
to
the
present
conditions
when
this
party
of
traders
spoken
of
arrived
governor
young
was
notified
and
came
to
provo
the
leaders
of
this
company
came
to
see
the
governor
i
acting
as
interpreter
young
had
the
law
read
and
explained
to
them
showing
them
that
from
this
on
they
were
under
obligations
to
observe
the
laws
of
the
united
states
instead
of
mexico
that
the
treaty
of
guadalupe
de
hidalgo
had
changed
the
conditions
and
that
from
this
on
they
were
under
the
control
of
the
united
states
he
further
showed
that
it
was
a
cruel
practice
to
enslave
human
beings
and
explained
that
the
results
of
such
a
business
caused
war
and
bloodshed
among
the
indian
tribes
the
mexicans
listened
with
respect
admitting
that
the
traffic
would
have
to
cease
it
was
plainly
shown
to
them
that
it
was
a
cruel
business
which
could
not
be
tolerated
any
longer
but
as
it
had
been
an
old
established
practice
they
were
not
so
much
to
blame
for
following
the
traffic
heretofore
now
it
was
expected
that
this
business
would
be
discontinued
all
seemed
satisfied
and
pledged
their
words
that
they
would
return
to
their
homes
without
trading
for
children
most
of
them
kept
their
promise
but
one
small
party
under
pedro
lion
violated
their
obligations
and
were
arrested
and
brought
before
the
united
states
court
judge
snow
presiding
this
was
quite
a
noted
case
i
was
employed
as
interpreter
george
smith
defended
the
prisoners
and
colonel
blair
prosecuted
with
great
wisdom
and
tact
he
knowing
all
about
the
mexican
character
having
been
in
the
texan
war
a
great
deal
of
prejudice
and
bitter
feeling
was
manifested
toward
the
mexicans
governor
young
seeing
this
used
all
his
influence
that
they
might
have
a
fair
and
impartial
trial
and
the
law
be
vindicated
in
a
spirit
of
justice
and
not
in
the
spirit
of
persecution
the
defence
made
by
the
mexicans
was
that
the
indians
had
stolen
a
lot
of
horses
from
them
and
that
they
had
followed
and
overtaken
them
on
coming
to
their
camp
they
found
the
indians
had
killed
and
eaten
the
horses
the
only
remuneration
they
could
get
was
to
take
some
children
which
the
indians
offered
in
payment
saying
they
did
not
mean
to
break
their
promise
this
defence
had
some
weight
whether
true
or
not
still
they
were
found
guilty
and
fined
the
trial
lasted
several
days
the
fines
were
afterwards
remitted
and
the
mexicans
allowed
to
return
home
they
had
been
delayed
some
time
and
made
nothing
on
their
trip
no
doubt
they
felt
sour
but
considering
the
law
they
were
dealt
leniently
with
this
broke
up
the
indian
slave
trade
stopping
this
slave
business
helped
to
sour
some
of
walker
band
they
were
in
the
habit
of
raiding
on
the
pahutes
and
low
tribes
taking
their
children
prisoners
and
selling
them
next
year
when
they
came
up
and
camped
on
the
provo
bench
they
had
some
indian
children
for
sale
they
offered
them
to
the
mormons
who
declined
buying
arapine
walkers
brother
became
enraged
saying
that
the
mormons
had
stopped
the
mexicans
from
buying
these
children
that
they
had
no
right
to
do
so
unless
they
bought
them
themselves
several
of
us
were
present
when
he
took
one
of
these
children
by
the
heels
and
dashed
its
brains
out
on
the
hard
ground
after
which
he
threw
the
body
towards
us
telling
us
we
had
no
hearts
or
we
would
have
bought
it
and
saved
its
life
this
was
a
strange
argument
but
it
was
the
argument
of
an
enraged
savage
i
never
heard
of
any
successful
attempts
to
buy
children
afterwards
by
the
mexicans
if
done
at
all
it
was
secretly

was

all
i
will
say
at
present
is
that
her
life
and
labors
are
as
much
a
part
of
mine
as
is
possible
for
a
wife
to
be
she
was
my
heart
choice
from
first
sight
and
so
continued
till
the
day
of
her
death
we
lived
on
a
farm
quite
a
distance
from
the
settlement
for
some
time
after
our
marriage
my
wife
father
philander
colton
went
to
california
the
spring
we
were
married
leaving
me
in
charge
of
his
farm
and
affairs
the
farm
was
near
the
indian
camping
ground
hundreds
of
them
were
often
around
us
sometimes
they
were
more
or
less
saucy
but
we
treated
them
kindly
my
wife
seemed
to
have
the
same
spirit
as
myself
in
regard
to
the
indians
feeling
friendly
towards
them
and
wishing
to
see
them
taught
and
helped
out
of
their
degraded
condition
nothing
occurred
in
my
experience
during
the
remainder
of
the
year
worth
recording
all
of
the
indians
around
were
friendly
toward
us
but
frequently
spoke
of
being
dissatisfied
with
the
treatment
received
from
some
others
many
will
say
and
with
some
truthfulness
that
indians
visit
their
revenge
upon
whites
indiscriminately
yet
if
one
treats
them
so
as
to
get
their
real
friendship
they
are
not
apt
to
harm
him
i
went
as
interpreter
for
president
young
in
the
spring
of
to
sanpete
county
where
some
disturbance
was
threatened
by
mexicans
under
the
leadership
of
a
certain
dr
bowman
from
new
mexico
who
seemed
inclined
to
make
himself
a
name
by
committing
some
violent
act
in
defiance
of
law
there
seemed
to
be
a
determination
on
his
part
and
those
with
him
to
revive
the
slave
trade
he
threatened
anyone
that
might
interfere
with
him
saying
he
could
bring
all
the
indians
in
the
mountains
to
help
him
i
was
acquainted
with
this
man
while
in
new

met
him
while
on
a
trip
to
sanpete

a
few
days
before
i
went

saw
me
he
began
to
curse
me
for
being
a
mormon
saying
he
had
power
at
his
back
to
use
all
the
mormons
up
i
felt
some
little
friendship
for
him
as
is
natural
for
me
to
feel
for
anyone
i
have
formerly
known
and
advised
him
to
act
more
careful
or
he
would
get
into
trouble
i
tried
to
reason
with
him
but
to
no
purpose
he
went
on
down
to
utah
valley
and
there
acted
in
an
insulting
and
threatening
manner
bowman
mexicans
were
encamped
on
the
west
side
of
the
sanpete
valley
it
was
deemed
prudent
to
bring
them
in
and
keep
an
eye
on
them
until
it
could
be
decided
what
their
intentions
were
for
at
this
time
it
was
seen
that
a
growing
spirit
of
war
was
upon
the
indians
and
almost
anything
would
stir
them
up
several
little
fusses
of
a
private
nature
had
lately
occurred
at
this
time
many
of
the
settlers
contrary
to
the
counsel
of
president
young
had
settled
on
farms
and
were
much
exposed
this
had
a
tendency
to
make
the
indians
aggressive
many
times
the
settlers
were
sorely
annoyed
by
the
indians
horses
getting
into
the
fields
when
remonstrated
with
they
would
ask
whose
lands
are
these
you
are
on
the
continual
advice
of
president
young
was
to
build
in
towns
fence
their
lands
and
be
kind
to
the
indians
that
it
was
cheaper
to
feed
than
to
fight
them
etc
some
heeded
this
counsel
while
many
did
not
i
was
one
of
a
party
of
four
or
five
who
went
out
and
brought
in
the
mexicans
they
were
a
little
suspicious
asking
a
great
many
questions
about
bowman
where
he
was
etc
but
i
finally
persuaded
them
to
go
with
us
we
had
no
authority
to
arrest
them
neither
was
it
the
intention
to
do
so
if
it
could
be
avoided
in
the
meantime
bowman
got
into
some
trouble
with
the
indians
by
deceiving
them
in
some
of
their
promised
trades
and
he
was
ambushed
and
killed
by
some
of
them
owing
to
his
manner
and
threats
it
was
rumored
the
mormons
had
killed
him
i
was
actively
engaged
as
interpreter
and
was
continually
around
during
this
time
i
never
had
the
least
suspicion
or
proof
that
bowman
was
killed
by
any
mormon
agency
and
i
believe
i
would
have
heard
something
of
it
if
such
had
been
the
case
i
know
in
those
days
it
was
no
uncommon
thing
for
a
man
to
be
killed
whether
a
mormon
or
not
by
the
indians
either
for
revenge
or
plunder
the
mexicans
soon
left
in
peace
in
the
summer
of
about
harvest
time
the
war
broke
out
the
immediate
cause
of
the
indian
war
was
the
striking
of
an
indian
with
a
gun
by
a
white
man
at
springville
this
indian
was
whipping
his
squaw
when
the
party
interfered
to
stop
him
the
indian
drew
his
gun
to
shoot
it
was
wrenched
from
him
the
man
using
the
gun
as
a
club
broke
both
stock
and
indian
head
i
believe
the
indian
died
from
the
effects
of
the
blow
he
was
one
of
walker
band
and
the
latter
at
once
painted
for
war
the
same
day
stewart
and
i
were
returning
from
payson
when
about
a
mile
from
there
some
warriors
painted
black
came
from
a
ravine
approaching
us
in
flank
with
guns
and
bows
ready
stewart
remarked
we
are
in
for
it
that
means
war
we
had
no
time
to
turn
and
run
as
they
were
within
one
hundred
yards
of
us
i
knew
i
had
never
wronged
them
but
had
always
been
a
friend
and
i
believed
if
we
went
straight
along
they
would
not
hurt
us
brother
stewart
agreed
with
me
we
never
halted
or
gave
the
road
but
drove
along
as
though
nothing
was
in
the
way
as
we
went
they
parted
and
allowed
us
the
road
never
speaking
or
making
any
sign
of
recognition
this
same
party
went
on
up
to
the
payson
mill
and
in
less
than
an
hour
commenced
killing
our
people
this
was
the
commencement
of
what
is
known
as
the
walker
war
it
caused
a
general
moving
in
of
those
who
had
settled
out
on
farms
making
towns
and
villages
spring
up
like
magic
i
remember
president
young
remarking
in
public
that
the
people
seemed
readier
to
obey
brother
invitation
to
live
together
in
towns
than
they
did
his
counsel
brother
brigham
always
gave
walker
great
credit
for
helping
to
build
up
utah
there
was
plenty
to
do
as
soon
as
the
war
commenced
an
attempt
was
made
to
follow
and
chastise
the
indians
but
nothing
that
resulted
in
much
good
was
ever
done
by
fighting
them
the
counsel
was
for
all
to
move
in
gather
the
stock
together
and
in
every
way
possible
guard
against
attacks
or
surprises
there
was
a
general
move
in
this
direction
cattle
were
gathered
and
herded
under
strong
guards
guards
were
also
placed
at
the
different
trails
leadings
into
the
valley
this
had
a
much
better
effect
than
following
the
indians
getting
shot
at
and
having
to
retreat
in
good
order
there
was
quite
a
band
of
provo
indians
who
took
no
part
in
the
fight
they
were
camped
on
the
bench
near
the
river
bottom
i
had
not
yet
moved
into
town
the
indians
were
around
me
daily
and
i
believed
them
to
be
friendly
an
order
was
issued
by
some
one
in
provo
to
have
them
taken
prisoners
and
brought
in
accordingly
a
company
of
militia
was
called
out
for
the
purpose
happening
along
just
as
they
were
starting
on
the
expedition
i
was
asked
to
go
and
help
take
the
indians
but
declined
and
protested
against
the
move
well
knowing
that
they
would
not
be
taken
as
they
had
done
nothing
to
justify
any
harsh
measures
against
them
my
remonstrance
was
in
vain
the
indians
had
to
be
taken
and
i
was
ordered
to
go
as
interpreter
so
we
marched
over
in
good
militia
style
every
man
keeping
step
with
himself
i
felt
much
amused
at
our
turnout
going
to
war
the
flower
of
our
army
was
then
out
after
walker
as
we
neared
the
camp
of
indians
i
asked
permission
to
go
ahead
and
tell
them
what
was
wanted
i
was
on
horseback
and
unarmed
the
indians
were
up
at
once
and
ready
for
fight
they
said
that
taking
them
prisoners
meant
to
kill
them
and
they
would
not
go
the
company
numbering
some
men
about
the
same
number
as
the
indians
had
now
come
up
and
stood
about
fifty
yards
off
facing
the
camp
i
went
and
told
the
captain
what
the
indians
said
he
replied
then
we
have
got
to
take
them
by
force
at
the
same
time
ordering
his
company
to
load
their
guns
i
now
became
frightened
for
i
knew
if
they
commenced
loading
the
indians
having
their
guns
ready
would
fire
the
minute
they
saw
the
whites
making
such
a
movement
but
as
long
as
they
did
not
know
that
the
guns
were
not
loaded
we
were
safe
i
asked
the
captain
to
hold
a
minute
and
let
me
ask
a
few
questions
he
agreed
how
many
of
you
have
loads
in
your
guns
i
asked
no
one
had
several
spoke
and
said
they
had
nothing
to
load
with
while
some
of
the
guns
were
out
of
repair
i
never
before
or
since
saw
anything
so
ridiculous
some
of
the
members
of
the
company
are
still
living
in
provo
and
will
remember
the
incident
i
asked
the
captain
what
he
thought
best
to
do
he
said
he
would
take
my
advice
under
the
circumstances
i
told
him
i
would
say
to
the
indians
that
it
was
all
right
that
they
were
friends
and
we
did
not
think
it
right
to
take
them
but
would
go
back
this
made
them
suspicious
they
moved
off
up
provo
canyon
and
committed
various
petty
thefts
from
time
to
time
annoying
the
people
for
several
months
chapter
x
my
interview
with
brother
george
smith
my
remark
he
wins
me
by
kindness
his
noble
character
peace
with
the
indians
when
the
troubles
began
brother
george
smith
who
was
presiding
in
utah
county
was
in
salt
lake
city
there
was
much
confusion
in
the
county
all
the
cattle
belonging
to
provo
twelve
hundred
head
were
got
together
on
the
lake
bottom
barney
ward
and
i
were
placed
as
guard
over
them
with
orders
not
to
let
them
get
away
we
stayed
with
them
until
we
were
about
worn
out
no
one
would
come
to
our
relief
till
brother
smith
came
to
give
directions
on
the
third
day
we
heard
he
had
arrived
i
went
in
early
to
see
him
i
had
not
slept
for
three
nights
and
had
been
in
the
saddle
most
of
the
time
consequently
i
did
not
feel
very
as
i
was
going
up
to
brother
smith
house
i
met
three
of
the
principal
brethren
on
the
street
they
asked
where
i
was
going
i
told
them
to
see
brother
smith
they
replied
that
he
was
not
up
and
i
could
not
see
him
i
answered
i
will
go
and
see
sure
enough
they
were
right
and
somewhat
sarcastically
said
you
will
learn
some
day
to
not
be
in
such
a
hurry
i
was
very
angry
and
made
an
remark
after
going
and
getting
my
breakfast
i
went
back
to
house
he
was
sitting
by
the
door
in
company
with
the
men
i
had
met
before
brother
smith
shook
hands
with
me
saying
i
understand
you
called
me
a
big
lazy
lout
what
do
you
mean
by
such
talk
did
you
say
it
i
replied
yes
sir
i
have
been
up
with
brother
ward
three
nights
herding
cattle
he
is
with
the
cattle
now
we
are
worn
out
and
can
not
stand
it
any
longer
i
thought
when
you
only
rode
from
salt
lake
city
in
a
carriage
and
have
slept
all
night
you
could
just
as
well
get
up
and
attend
to
business
as
for
us
to
be
up
three
nights
that
is
why
i
said
it
brother
smith
turned
to
one
of
these
men
saying
go
get
some
men
and
relieve
brother
barney
immediately
bro
jones
go
home
and
go
to
sleep
when
you
wake
up
you
will
feel
better
i
felt
ashamed
for
bro
smith
manifested
no
anger
when
i
awoke
in
the
afternoon
i
went
to
see
bro
smith
intending
to
ask
his
pardon
on
seeing
me
he
took
me
by
the
hand
laughing
heartily
asking
me
if
i
felt
any
better
and
talking
in
a
very
pleasant
manner
giving
me
no
chance
to
apologize
many
years
afterwards
he
spoke
of
it
and
laughed
about
it
as
a
good
joke
i
relate
this
to
show
the
nobility
of
his
character
being
above
small
prejudice
i
have
met
others
who
ought
to
be
as
good
as
brother
smith
who
would
never
have
forgiven
me
if
i
had
made
such
a
remark
about
them
how
long
the
war
continued
is
a
question
active
hostilities
were
kept
up
more
or
less
according
to
opportunities
during
the
summer
of
when
the
indians
had
a
good
chance
they
would
steal
or
kill
some
were
more
or
less
peaceable
when
it
suited
them
i
never
went
out
to
fight
as
i
made
no
pretensions
whatever
of
being
an
indian
fighter
i
did
my
portion
of
military
duty
i
assisted
in
various
ways
in
helping
to
protect
ourselves
against
the
natives
but
i
always
made
it
a
rule
to
cultivate
a
friendly
feeling
whenever
opportunity
presented
so
much
so
that
the
indians
always
recognized
me
as
a
friend
to
their
race
i
had
learned
some
little
about
military
affairs
while
in
mexico
i
assisted
in
organizing
and
drilling
the
militia
from
time
to
time
i
also
acted
as
adjutant
under
conover
as
early
as
afterwards
filled
the
same
position
under
pace
in
i
did
not
like
the
office
and
resigned
but
was
induced
to
accept
the
office
again
for
the
purpose
of
making
out
returns
to
the
government
for
services
rendered
by
some
of
the
utah
militia
these
returns
were
accepted
the
men
paid
and
land
warrants
issued
i
was
assisted
by
nuttall
and
hickman
as
clerks
after
this
brother
nuttall
was
appointed
in
my
place
and
continued
to
act
under
pace
to
my
knowledge
as
late
as
the
echo
canyon
war
president
young
advised
the
people
to
wall
in
their
towns
this
puzzled
the
indians
we
told
them
it
was
our
intention
to
shut
them
out
and
have
no
more
to
do
with
them
this
they
did
not
like
for
there
was
no
great
length
of
time
but
what
some
of
the
different
bands
were
on
friendly
terms
with
the
settlers
walker
finally
said
if
we
would
quit
building
walls
they
would
quit
fighting
but
the
good
peace
was
broken
and
there
was
always
some
of
the
whites
holding
grudges
against
the
indians
still
we
called
it
peace
the
local
troubles
are
matters
of
general
history
i
aim
to
deal
more
with
that
which
is
not
written
i
always
considered
the
natives
entitled
to
a
hearing
as
well
as
the
whites
both
were
often
in
the
wrong
the
white
men
should
be
patient
and
just
with
the
indians
and
not
demand
of
them
in
their
untutored
condition
the
same
responsibility
they
would
of
the
more
intelligent
class
further
along
in
this
history
we
will
see
the
indians
defence
chapter
xi
president
young
calls
for
volunteers
to
meet
the
company
i
join
the
party
names
of
the
company
one
party
of
emigrants
found
in
a
starving
condition
i
attended
the
october
conference
of
when
conference
was
opened
president
young
arose
and
said
there
are
a
number
of
our
people
on
the
plains

have
started
to
come

and
i

go
out
and
meet
them
if
the
teams
are
not
voluntarily
furnished
there
are
plenty
of
good
ones
in
the
street
and
i
shall
call
upon
brother
little
the
marshal
to
furnish
them
now
we
will
adjourn
this
conference
until
brother
young
was
in
earnest
he
seemed
moved
by
a
spirit
that
would
admit
of
no
delay
a
few
days
before
this
a
number
of
elders
had
arrived
from
the
old
country
reporting
that
the
people
were
on
the
road
but
they
did
not
know
how
far
they
had
advanced
in
those
days
there
was
no
telegraph
and
mails
from
the
east
only
reached
utah
monthly
they
being
many
times
delayed
by
high
water
indians
or
other
causes
brother
young
called
upon
every
one
present
to
lend
a
hand
in
fitting
up
these
teams
as
i
was
going
out
with
the
crowd
brother
wells
spoke
to
me
saying
you
are
a
good
hand
for
the
trip
get
ready
soon
after
bishop
hunter
said
the
same
thing
to
me
also
brother
grant
met
me
and
said
i
want
you
on
this
trip
i
began
to
think
it
time
to
decide
so
i
answered
all
right
i
had
a
saddle
horse
we
were
instructed
to
get
everything
we
could
ready
and
rendezvous
between
the
big
and
little
mountains
a
short
day
drive
out
from
salt
lake
next
day
teams
and
volunteer
men
were
ready
a
better
outfit
and
one
more
adapted
to
the
work
before
us
i
do
not
think
could
have
possibly
been
selected
if
a
week
had
been
spent
in
fitting
up
besides
the
wagons
and
teams
several
men
went
horseback
we
had
good
teams
and
provisions
in
great
abundance
but
best
of
all
those
going
were
alive
to
the
work
and
were
of
the
best
material
possible
for
the
occasion
as
soon
as
all
were
together
we
organized
and
moved
on
george
grant
was
selected
captain
with
robert
burton
and
william

as
assistants
cyrus

charles
decker
guide
i
was
given
the
important
position
of
chief
cook
for
the
head
mess
i
was
quite
proud
of
my
office
for
it
made
me
the
most
sought
after
and
popular
man
in
the
camp
the
rest
of
the
company
was
made

these
are
all
the
names
that
i
remember
if
there
were
any
more
i
have
been
unable
to
find
them
the
weather
soon
became
cold
and
stormy
we
traveled
hard
never
taking
time
to
stop
for
dinner
on
getting
into
camp
all
were
hungry
and
willing
to
help
no
doubt
many
of
the
boys
remember
the
hearty
suppers
eaten
on
this
expedition
there
was
some
expectation
of
meeting
the
first
train
brother
willie
on
or
about
green
river
we
began
to
feel
great
anxiety
about
the
emigrants
as
the
weather
was
now
cold
and
stormy
and
we
strong
men
with
good
outfits
found
the
nights
severe
what
must
be
the
condition
of
those
we
were
to
meet
many
old
men
and
women
little
children
mothers
with
nursing
babes
crossing
the
plains
pulling
our
hearts
began
to
ache
when
we
reached
green
river
and
yet
no
word
of
them
here
an
express
was
sent
on
ahead
with
a
light
wagon
to
meet
and
cheer
the
people
up
cyrus
wheelock
and
stephen
taylor
went
with
this
express
at
the
south
pass
we
encountered
a
severe
snowstorm
after
crossing
the
divide
we
turned
down
into
a
sheltered
place
on
the
sweetwater
while
in
camp
and
during
the
two
men
were
seen
on
horseback
going
west
they
were
hailed
on
reaching
us
they
proved
to
be
brothers
willie
and
j
b
elder
they
reported
their
company
in
a
starving
condition
at
their
camp
then
east
of
rocky
ridge
and
said
our
express
had
gone
on
to
meet
the
other
companies
still
in
the
rear
we
started
immediately
through
the
storm
to
reach
brother
willie
camp
on
arriving
we
found
them
in
a
condition
that
would
stir
the
feelings
of
the
hardest
heart
they
were
in
a
poor
place
the
storm
having
caught
them
where
fuel
was
scarce
they
were
out
of
provisions
and
really
freezing
and
starving
to
death
the
morning
after
our
arrival
nine
were
buried
in
one
grave
we
did
all
we
could
to
relieve
them
the
boys
struck
out
on
horseback
and
dragged
up
a
lot
of
wood
provisions
were
distributed
and
all
went
to
work
to
cheer
the
sufferers
soon
there
was
an
improvement
in
camp
but
many
poor
faithful
people
had
gone
too
far
had
passed
beyond
the
power
to
recruit
our
help
came
too
late
for
some
and
many
died
after
our
arrival
william
kimball
with
a
few
men
and
wagons
turned
back
taking
the
oversight
of
this
company
to
help
them
in
capt
grant
left
a
wagon
load
of
flour
near
the
pass
with
redick
allred
to
guard
it
there
were
several
hundred
people
with
brother
willie
they
had
a
few
teams
but
most
of
them
had
become
too
weak
to
be
of
much
service
when
we
left
salt
lake
it
was
understood
that
other
teams
would
follow
until
all
the
help
needed
would
be
on
the
road
the
greater
portion
of
our
company
now
continued
on
towards
gate
traveling
through
snow
all
the
way
when
we
arrived
at
gate
we
found
our
express
there
awaiting
us
no
tidings
as
yet
were
received
of
the
other
companies
chapter
xii
myself
and
two
companions
sent
to
search
for
missing
companies
we
find
them
our
cool
reception
at
one
camp
apathy
manifested
terrible
sufferings
having
seen
the
sufferings
of
brother
willie
company
we
more
fully
realized
the
danger
the
others
were
in
the
elders
who
had
just
returned
from
england
having
many
dear
friends
with
these
companies
suffered
great
anxiety
some
of
them
feeling
more
or
less
the
responsibility
resting
upon
them
for
allowing
these
people
to
start
so
late
in
the
season
across
the
plains
at
first
we
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
for
we
did
not
expect
to
have
to
go
further
than
devil
gate
we
decided
to
make
camp
and
send
on
an
express
to
find
where
the
people
were
and
not
to
return
until
they
were
found
joseph
a
young
abe
garr
and
i
were
selected
some
histories
give
other
names
but
i
was
there
myself
and
am
not
mistaken
with
picked
saddle
horses
and
a
pack
mule
we
started
out
the
first
night
we
camped
our
horses
followed
a
band
of
buffaloes
several
miles
it
was
near
noon
the
next
day
when
we
returned
with
them
we
determined
to
get
even
with
them
so
rode
at
full
gallop
wherever
the
the
road
would
permit
after
riding
about
twelve
miles
we
saw
a
white
man
shoe
track
in
the
road
bro
young
called
out
here
they
are
we
put
our
animals
to
their
utmost
speed
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
camp
at
red
bluff
this
was
brother
edward
company
and
ben
horgett
wagon
company
there
was
still
another
wagon
company
down
near
the
platte
crossing
this
company
was
in
almost
as
bad
a
condition
as
the
first
one
they
had
nearly
given
up
hope
their
provisions
were
about
exhausted
and
many
of
them
worn
out
and
sick
when
we
rode
in
there
was
a
general
rush
to
shake
hands
i
took
no
part
in
the
ceremony
many
declared
we
were
angels
from
heaven
i
told
them
i
thought
we
were
better
than
angels
for
this
occasion
as
we
were
good
strong
men
come
to
help
them
into
the
valley
and
that
our
company
and
wagons
loaded
with
provisions
were
not
far
away
i
thought
this
the
best
consolation
under
the
circumstances
brother
young
told
the
people
to
gather
up
and
move
on
at
once
as
the
only
salvation
was
to
travel
a
little
every
day
this
was
right
and
no
doubt
saved
many
lives
for
we
among
so
many
some
twelve
hundred
could
do
but
little
and
there
was
danger
of
starvation
before
help
could
arrive
unless
the
people
made
some
toward
the
valley
after
talking
to
and
encouraging
the
people
they
agreed
to
start
on
the
next
morning
we
then
started
full
gallop
for
john
hunt
camp
fifteen
miles
further
on
arriving
no
one
noticed
us
or
appeared
to
care
who
we
were
their
tents
were
pitched
in
good
shape
wood
was
plentiful
and
no
one
seemed
concerned
joseph
a
young
became
offended
not
expecting
such
a
cool
reception
and
remarked
well
it
appears
we
are
not
needed
here
so
we
went
down
into
the
bottom
and
made
camp
for
ourselves
after
a
while
some
one
sauntered
down
our
way
thinking
probably
we
were
mountaineers
these
recognized
brother
young
and
made
a
rush
for
camp
giving
the
word
soon
we
were
literally
carried
in
and
a
special
tent
was
pitched
for
our
use
everything
was
done
to
make
amends
for
the
previous
neglect
i
never
could
see
where
the
amends
came
in
for
no
one
happened
to
know
us
when
we
first
arrived
and
strangers
were
often
passing
this
being
near
where
several
camps
of
old
traders
were
located
about
the
time
we
were
settled
in
our
tent
captain
hunt
and
gilbert
van
schoonhoven
his
assistant
arrived
from
the
platte
bridge
also
captain
ben
horgett
they
were
rejoiced
to
meet
us
here
i
first
met
gib
spencer
and
formed
a
friendly
acquaintance
with
him
which
continues
to
this
day
these
people
were
just
on
the
eve
of
suffering
but
as
yet
had
not
quite
a
number
of
their
cattle
had
died
during
the
snow
storm
which
had
now
been
on
them
for
nine
days
next
morning
brother
young
and
others
went
to
platte
bridge
leaving
brother
garr
and
i
to
get
the
company
started
according
to
agreement
made
the
evening
before
there
was
a
spirit
of
apathy
among
the
people
instead
of
going
for
their
teams
at
once
several
began
to
quarrel
about
who
should
go
this
made
us
feel
like
leaving
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
we
saddled
up
to
do
so
the
clouds
were
gathering
thickly
for
storm
and
just
as
we
were
about
to
start
it
commenced
snowing
very
hard
the
heavens
were
obscured
by
clouds
excepting
a
small
place
about
the
shape
of
the
gable
end
of
a
house
this
opening
was
in
the
direction
of
the
valley
and
the
sun
seemed
to
shine
through
with
great
brightness
we
mounted
our
mules
brother
garr
pointing
to
the
bright
spot
in
the
heavens
said
do
you
see
that
hole
you
had
better
all
get
out
of
here
before
that
closes
up
for
it
is
your
opening
to
the
valley
we
are
going
the
people
i
believe
took
this
for
a
warning
and
soon
started
for
their
cattle
next
morning
they
moved
on
brother
garr
and
i
went
back
to
where
martin
camp
had
been
they
had
rolled
out
and
captain
horgetts
wagon
company
were
just
starting
we
continued
on
overtaking
the
company
ascending
a
long
muddy
hill
a
condition
of
distress
here
met
my
eyes
that
i
never
saw
before
or
since
the
train
was
strung
out
for
three
or
four
miles
there
were
old
men
pulling
and
tugging
their
carts
sometimes
loaded
with
a
sick
wife
or
children
women
pulling
along
sick
husbands
little
children
six
to
eight
years
old
struggling
through
the
mud
and
snow
as
night
came
on
the
mud
would
freeze
on
their
clothes
and
feet
there
were
two
of
us
and
hundreds
needing
help
what
could
we
do
we
gathered
on
to
some
of
the
most
helpless
with
our
riatas
tied
to
the
carts
and
helped
as
many
as
we
could
into
camp
on
avenue
hill
this
was
a
bitter
cold
night
and
we
had
no
fuel
except
very
small
sage
brush
several
died
that
night
next
morning
brother
young
having
come
up
we
three
started
for
our
camp
near
devil
gate
all
were
rejoiced
to
get
the
news
that
we
had
found
the
emigrants
the
following
morning
most
of
the
company
moved
down
meeting
the
company
at
greasewood
creek
such
assistance
as
we
could
give
was
rendered
to
all
until
they
finally
arrived
at
devil
gate
fort
about
the
of
november
there
were
some
twelve
hundred
in
all
about
with
and
the
other
half
with
teams
chapter
xiii
short
rations
wagons
unloaded
of
their
freight
and
loaded
with
emigrants
myself
and
company
left
to
guard
the
goods
one
discouragement
the
winter
storms
had
now
set
in
in
all
their
severity
the
provisions
we
took
amounted
to
almost
nothing
among
so
many
people
many
of
them
now
on
very
short
rations
some
almost
starving
many
were
dying
daily
from
exposure
and
want
of
food
we
were
at
a
loss
to
know
why
others
had
not
come
on
to
our
assistance
the
company
was
composed
of
average
emigrants
old
and
young
women
and
children
the
men
seemed
to
be
failing
and
dying
faster
than
the
women
and
children
the
company
was
moved
over
to
a
cove
in
the
mountains
for
shelter
and
fuel
a
distance
of
two
miles
from
the
fort
the
wagons
were
banked
near
the
fort
it
became
impossible
to
travel
further
without
reconstruction
or
help
we
did
all
we
possibly
could
to
help
and
cheer
the
people
some
writers
have
endeavored
to
make
individual
heroes
of
some
of
our
company
i
have
no
remembrance
of
any
one
shirking
his
duty
each
and
everyone
did
all
they
possibly
could
and
justice
would
give
to
each
his
due
credit
all
the
people
who
could
crowded
into
the
houses
of
the
fort
out
of
the
cold
and
storm
one
crowd
cut
away
the
walls
of
the
house
they
were
in
for
fuel
until
half
of
the
roof
fell
in
fortunately
they
were
all
on
the
protected
side
and
no
one
was
hurt
many
suggestions
were
offered
as
to
what
should
be
done
some
efforts
being
made
to
cache
the
imperishable
goods
and
go
on
with
the
rest
accordingly
pits
were
dug
boxes
opened
and
the
hardware
put
in
one
while
clothing
were
put
in
another
often
these
boxes
belonged
to
different
persons
an
attempt
was
made
by
brother
cantwell
to
keep
an
account
of
these
changes
this
caching
soon
proved
to
be
a
failure
for
the
pits
would
fill
up
with
drifting
snow
as
fast
as
the
dirt
was
thrown
out
so
no
caches
were
made
the
goods
were
never
replaced
each
evening
the
elders
would
meet
in
council
i
remember
hearing
charles
decker
remark
that
he
had
crossed
the
plains
over
fifty
times
carrying
the
mail
and
this
was
the
darkest
hour
he
had
ever
seen
cattle
and
horses
were
dying
every
day
what
to
do
was
all
that
could
be
talked
about
five
or
six
days
had
passed
and
nothing
determined
upon
steve
taylor
al
huntington
and
i
were
together
when
the
question
why
does
captain
grant
leave
all
the
goods
here
with
some
one
to
watch
them
and
move
on
was
asked
we
agreed
to
make
this
proposal
to
him
it
was
near
the
time
appointed
for
the
meeting
as
soon
as
we
were
together
capt
grant
asked
if
anyone
had
thought
of
a
plan
we
presented
ours
capt
grant
replied
i
have
thought
of
this
but
there
are
no
provisions
to
leave
and
it
would
be
asking
too
much
of
anyone
to
stay
here
and
starve
for
the
sake
of
these
goods
besides
where
is
there
a
man
who
would
stay
if
called
upon
i
answered
any
of
us
would
i
had
no
idea
i
would
be
selected
as
it
was
acknowledged
i
was
the
best
cook
in
camp
and
capt
grant
had
often
spoken
as
though
he
could
not
spare
me
that
a
proper
understanding
may
be
had
i
will
say
that
these
goods
were
the
luggage
of
a
season
emigration
that
these
two
wagon
trains
had
contracted
to
freight
and
it
was
being
taken
through
as
well
as
the
luggage
of
the
people
present
leading
these
goods
meant
to
abandon
all
that
many
poor
families
had
upon
earth
so
it
was
different
from
common
merchandise
there
was
a
move
made
at
once
to
adopt
this
suggestion
accordingly
next
morning
store
rooms
in
the
fort
were
cleared
and
some
two
hundred
wagons
run
in
and
unloaded
no
one
was
allowed
to
keep
out
anything
but
a
change
of
clothing
some
bedding
and
light
cooking
utensils
hauling
provisions
was
not
a
weighty
question
this
unloading
occupied
three
days
the
handcart
people
were
notified
to
abandon
most
of
their
carts
teams
were
hitched
up
and
the
sick
and
feeble
loaded
in
with
such
light
weight
as
was
allowed
all
became
common
property
when
everything
was
ready
brother
burton
said
to
me
now
brother
jones
we
want
you
to
pick
two
men
from
the
valley
to
stay
with
you
we
have
notified
captains
hunt
and
horgett
to
detail
seventeen
men
from
their
companies
to
stay
with
you
we
will
move
on
in
the
morning
get
your
company
together
and
such
provisions
as
you
can
find
in
the
hands
of
those
who
may
have
anything
to
spare
you
know
ours
is
about
out
will
you
do
it
i
said
yes
well
take
your
choice
from
our
company
you
are
acquainted
with
the
boys
and
whoever
you
want
will
stay
i
had
a
great
mind
to
tell
him
i
wanted
captains
grant
and
burton
there
was
not
money
enough
on
earth
to
have
hired
me
to
stay
i
had
left
home
for
only
a
few
days
and
was
not
prepared
to
remain
so
long
away
but
i
remembered
my
assertion
that
any
of
us
would
stay
if
called
upon
i
could
not
back
out
so
i
selected
thomas
alexander
and
ben
hampton
i
am
satisfied
that
two
more
faithful
men
to
stand
under
all
hardships
could
not
have
been
found
that
night
we
were
called
together
and
organized
as
a
branch
dan
jones
thomas
alexander
and
ben
hampton
were
chosen
to
preside
with
laty
as
clerk
the
rest
of
the
company
was
composed
of
the
following

watts
and
captain
grant
asked
about
our
provisions
i
told
him
they
were
scant
but
as
many
were
suffering
and
some
dying
all
we
asked
was
an
equal
chance
with
the
rest
he
told
us
there
would
be
a
lot
of
worn
out
cattle
left
to
gather
them
up
and
try
to
save
them
they
consisted
mostly
of
yearlings
and
heifers
some
one
was
taking
through
the
storm
had
now
ceased
to
rage
and
great
hopes
were
felt
for
a
successful
move
we
were
daily
expecting
more
help
and
often
wondered
why
it
did
not
come
next
day
all
hands
pulled
out
most
of
them
on
foot
after
getting
my
camp
regulated
a
little
and
giving
some
instructions
i
got
on
my
horse
and
rode
on
to
see
how
the
train
was
moving
along
all
were
out
of
sight
when
i
started
after
traveling
a
few
miles
i
came
upon
a
lady
sitting
alone
on
the
side
of
the
road
weeping
bitterly
i
noticed
she
was
elegantly
dressed
and
appeared
strong
and
well
i
asked
her
what
was
the
matter
she
sobbingly
replied
this
is
too
much
for
me
i
have
always
had
plenty
and
have
never
known
hardships
we
had
a
good
team
and
wagon
my
husband
if
let
alone
could
have
taken
me
on
in
comfort
now
i
am
turned
out
to
walk
in
this
wind
and
snow
i
am
determined
not
to
go
on
but
will
stay
here
and
die
my
husband
has
gone
on
and
left
me
but
i
will
not
go
another
step
the
train
was
two
or
three
miles
ahead
and
moving
on
i
persuaded
her
after
a
while
to
go
on
with
me
this
lady
linforth
and
her
husband
now
live
in
san
francisco
california
they
could
not
stand
the
hardships
of
zion
but
i
believe
they
are
friendly
to
our
people
after
overtaking
the
train
and
seeing
them
on
the
move
captain
grant
asked
me
to
go
back
with
instructions
for
the
brethren
left
with
me
then
to
come
on
next
day
and
camp
with
them
over
night
on
calling
the
company
together
at
the
fort
that
night
i
told
them
in
plain
words
that
if
there
was
a
man
in
camp
who
could
not
help
eat
the
last
poor
animal
left
with
us
hides
and
all
suffer
all
manner
of
privations
almost
starve
to
death
that
he
could
go
on
with
me
the
next
day
and
overtake
the
trains
no
one
wanted
to
go
all
voted
to
take
their
chances
on
taking
stock
of
provisions
we
found
about
twenty
day
rations
no
salt
or
bread
excepting
a
few
crackers
there
was
at
least
five
months
of
winter
before
us
and
nothing
much
to
eat
but
a
few
perishing
cattle
and
what
game
we
might
chance
to
kill
the
game
was
not
very
certain
as
the
severe
storms
had
driven
everything
away
the
first
move
was
to
fix
up
the
fort
accordingly
brother
alexander
being
a
practical
man
was
appointed
to
manage
the
business
brother
hampton
was
to
see
about
the
cattle
i
followed
the
train
this
day
to
their
second
encampment
and
the
next
day
traveled
with
them
there
was
much
suffering
deaths
occurring
often
eph
hanks
arrived
in
camp
from
the
valley
and
brought
word
that
some
of
the
teams
that
had
reached
south
pass
and
should
have
met
us
here
had
turned
back
towards
home
and
tried
to
persuade
redick
allred
who
was
left
there
with
a
load
of
flour
to
go
back
with
them
the
men
who
did
this
might
have
felt
justified
they
said
it
was
no
use
going
farther
that
we
had
doubtless
all
perished
i
will
not
mention
their
names
for
it
was
always
looked
upon
by
the
company
as
cowardly
in
the
extreme
if
this
had
not
occurred
it
was
the
intention
of
captain
grant
to
have
sent
some
one
down
to
us
with
a
load
of
flour
as
it
was
by
the
time
any
was
received
the
people
were
in
a
starving
condition
and
could
not
spare
it
from
the
third
camp
where
i
saw
the
last
of
the
brethren
an
express
was
sent
on
to
catch
the
returning
supplies
and
continue
on
to
the
valley
giving
word
that
the
train
was
coming
i
know
nothing
more
of
them
except
from
reports
as
i
am
writing
mainly
from
my
own
observations
i
will
simply
state
that
after
great
suffering
and
much
assistance
hundreds
turning
out
to
help
the
emigrants
were
finally
landed
in
the
valley
chapter

we
kill
our
cattle
to
keep
them
from
wolves
visit
from
two
brethren
letter
from
president
young
a
mail
company
nearly
perishes
i
left
the
company
feeling
a
little
downcast
to
return
to
gate
it
was
pretty
well
understood
that
there
would
be
no
relief
sent
us
my
hopes
were
that
we
could
kill
game
we
had
accepted
the
situation
and
as
far
as
capt
grant
was
concerned
he
had
done
as
much
as
he
could
for
us
there
was
more
risk
for
those
who
went
on
than
for
us
remaining
on
returning
to
camp
i
found
that
the
cattle
left
were
very
poor
the
weather
had
moderated
and
we
hoped
to
get
them
on
good
feed
and
recruit
them
a
little
over
two
hundred
head
of
cattle
had
died
in
the
vicinity
of
the
fort
along
the
road
each
way
for
a
day
travel
were
carcases
this
led
droves
of
prairie
wolves
into
our
camp
it
was
almost
impossible
to
keep
them
off
from
the
cattle
in
the
day
time
we
were
obliged
to
corral
them
at
night
once
in
the
day
time
a
small
bunch
was
taken
and
run
off
in
spite
of
the
efforts
of
the
herders
to
stop
them
in
fact
it
became
dangerous
to
face
these
wolves
they
were
at
times
almost
ready
to
attack
men
we
soon
found
it
would
be
impossible
to
save
the
cattle
already
some
had
died
or
been
killed
by
the
wolves
within
a
week
it
was
decided
to
kill
the
rest
some
fifty
head
a
few
were
in
living
order
but
many
would
have
died
within
hours
in
fact
we
killed
them
to
keep
them
from
dying
we
had
a
butcher
from
london
who
dressed
everything
in
the
best
style
everything
was
saved
that
we
thought
might
be
eaten
we
hung
the
meat
up
the
poorest
of
it
we
did
not
expect
to
eat
but
intended
to
use
it
for
wolf
bait
further
along
when
the
carcases
were
all
devoured
provided
we
could
get
traps
from
the
platte
bridge
which
we
afterwards
did
we
never
used
our
poor
beef
for
wolf
bait
as
we
had
to
eat
the
whole
of
it
ourselves
and
finally
the
hides
were
all
consumed
for
food
after
killing
the
cattle
we
had
nothing
much
to
do
but
fix
up
the
fort
and
look
after
four
ponies
we
had
left
brother
hampton
and
myself
had
our
saddle
horses
yet
in
good
order
there
were
plenty
of
guns
and
ammunition
left
with
us
also
dishes
and
cooking
utensils
after
thoroughly
repairing
the
houses
chinking
and
daubing
them
we
overhauled
the
goods
stored
away
while
storing
the
bales
and
boxes
the
snow
had
drifted
in
among
them
there
was
nothing
but
dirt
floors
and
the
goods
had
been
tumbled
in
without
any
regard
to
order
having
cleaned
out
everything
we
took
ox
yokes
of
which
there
were
a
great
many
and
made
floors
of
them
and
then
piled
the
goods
on
them
while
handling
the
goods
we
found
some
coffee
sugar
and
fruit
also
a
roll
of
leather
these
we
kept
out
and
put
in
our
store
room
for
use
we
also
found
a
box
of
soap
and
candles
these
goods
were
marked
richards
daniel
spencer
john
van
cott
james
furgeson
william
dunbar
cyrus
wheelock
and
chauncy
webb
most
of
them
john
van
cott
we
were
told
by
captain
grant
to
use
anything
we
could
find
to
make
us
comfortable
during
the
time
we
were
at
a
loss
what
to
do
men
minds
did
not
run
much
upon
property
the
main
interest
was
to
save
life
one
prominent
elder
became
very
liberal
he
had
several
large
trunks
filled
with
valuable
stuff
he
opened
his
heart
and
trunks
making
presents
to
several
of
the
boys
from
the
valley
of
socks
shirts
and
such
things
as
would
help
to
make
them
comfortable
he
left
his
trunks
in
my
rooms
giving
me
the
keys
and
telling
me
to
use
anything
there
was
not
to
suffer
for
anything
that
could
be
found
and
asked
god
to
bless
me
i
told
the
boys
who
remained
with
me
that
we
had
better
not
open
this
man
trunks
that
when
he
got
to
the
valley
and
had
time
to
think
he
would
change
his
mind
and
would
doubtless
be
thinking
we
were
using
his
goods
and
if
we
touched
anything
belonging
to
him
we
would
be
accused
of
taking
more
than
we
had
later
occurrences
proved
this
to
be
a
good
suggestion
with
the
cattle
killed
that
were
fit
to
eat
and
what
provisions
we
had
on
hand
we
managed
to
live
for
a
while
without
suffering
except
for
salt
bread
soon
gave
out
and
we
lived
on
meat
alone
some
of
us
went
out
hunting
daily
but
with
poor
success
a
day
or
two
before
christmas
ephraim
hanks
and
feramorz
little
arrived
at
the
fort
bringing
the
mail
from
the
valley
with
the
following
letter
of
instructions
from
president
young
president
office
great
salt
lake
city
jones
alexander
and
hampton
in
charge
at
devil
gate
and
the
rest
of
the
brethren
at
that
dear
brethren
quite
unexpectedly
to
us
we
have
the
opportunity
of
sending
you
a
few
suggestions
as
judge
smith
the
post
master
here
has
concluded
to
forward
the
eastern
mail
by
brothers
feramorz
little
and
ephraim
hanks
being
somewhat
aware
of
a
natural
disposition
in
many
to
relax
their
vigilance
after
a
temporary
and
unaccustomed
watchfulness
more
especially
in
case
no
particular
cause
of
alarm
is
of
frequent
occurrence
i
feel
impressed
to
write
a
few
suggestions
and
words
of
counsel
to
you
all
you
are
in
an
indian
country
few
in
number
blockaded
by
the
snows
and
far
from
assistance
at
this
season
of
the
year
under
such
circumstances
you
can
but
realize
the
necessity
of
all
of
you
being
constantly
on
the
alert
to
be
firm
steady
and
united
faithful
and
watchful
living
your
religion
do
not
go
from
your
fort
in
small
parties
of
one
two
or
three
at
a
time
but
when
game
is
to
be
sought
wood
got
up
or
any
other
operation
to
be
performed
requiring
you
to
travel
from
under
the
protection
of
the
fort
guns
go
in
bands
of
some
ten
or
twelve
together
and
let
them
be
well
armed
and
let
those
who
stay
by
the
stuff
be
watchful
while
their
comrades
are
out
and
at
all
times
and
under
all
circumstances
let
every
person
have
his
arms
and
ammunitions
ready
for
active
service
at
a
moment
warning
so
you
can
not
be
surprised
by
your
foes
nor
in
any
way
be
taken
advantage
of
whether
in
or
out
of
the
fort
always
have
plenty
of
water
about
the
buildings
and
be
very
careful
about
fires
and
the
preservation
from
damp
fire
or
other
damage
of
the
goods
in
your
care
unless
buffaloes
and
other
game
come
within
a
reasonable
distance
you
had
better
kill
some
of
the
cattle
than
run
much
risk
in
quest
of
game
use
all
due
diligence
for
the
preservation
of
your
stock
and
try
to
so
ration
out
your
flour
as
to
have
it
last
until
we
can
send
you
relief
which
as
before
stated
will
be
forwarded
as
early
as
possible
in
the
spring
but
may
not
reach
you
until
may
depending
somewhat
on
the
winter
snows
and
spring
weather
of
which
you
will
be
able
to
form
an
estimate
as
the
season
advances
we
will
send
teams
to
your
relief
as
early
as
possible
in
the
spring
and
trust
to
learn
that
all
has
been
well
with
you
and
the
property
in
your
care
brothers
little
and
hanks
will
furnish
you
with
items
of
news
from
the
valley
and
i
will
forward
you
some
packages
of
our
papers
by
them
praying
you
may
be
united
faithful
and
protected
i
remain
your
brother
in
the
gospel
brigham
young
from
this
letter
it
is
plain
to
see
that
brother
brigham
was
not
apprised
of
our
condition
he
afterwards
said
if
he
had
known
our
situation
he
would
have
relieved
us
if
it
had
taken
half
the
men
in
the
valley
i
never
felt
to
complain
the
brethren
who
left
us
knew
but
little
about
what
was
left
to
provision
us
the
supposition
was
that
the
cattle
would
have
furnished
us
in
case
game
could
not
be
killed
brother
alexander
and
i
were
out
for
several
days
killing
some
game
on
this
trip
we
were
much
disappointed
on
our
return
to
find
that
brothers
hanks
and
little
had
gone
on
east
without
us
seeing
them
brother
little
looked
around
at
our
supplies
telling
the
boys
to
take
care
of
the
hides
that
they
were
better
than
nothing
to
eat
this
proved
good
advice
soon
after
the
magraw
mail
company
came
along
under
the
charge
of
jesse
jones
they
left
their
coaches
fitted
up
with
packs
and
started
for
the
valley
brother
joseph
heywood
united
states
marshal
for
utah
was
a
passenger
they
went
as
far
as
the
south
pass
the
storm
setting
in
so
severely
they
could
not
face
it
they
came
near
freezing
to
death
it
was
with
great
difficulty
that
brother
heywood
was
kept
alive
the
day
they
returned
to
our
camp
we
had
killed
a
buffalo
some
twelve
miles
distant
it
took
all
hands
three
days
to
get
it
into
camp
this
buffalo
i
shot
at
the
risk
of
my
life
he
was
coming
toward
me
in
a
snow
trail
i
lay
on
the
trail
with
nothing
to
protect
me
if
i
had
not
killed
him
he
would
doubtless
have
run
on
to
me
but
he
dropped
at
the
first
shot
we
were
about
out
of
anything
fit
to
eat
and
it
did
not
require
much
bravery
to
take
the
risk
for
almost
anyone
will
take
desperate
chances
when
hungry
we
wounded
two
others
that
we
expected
to
get
but
about
the
time
we
commenced
dressing
the
one
killed
there
came
on
a
regular
blizzard
that
lasted
several
days
we
had
hard
work
to
save
the
lives
of
the
men
getting
the
meat
into
camp
chapter

our
food
exhausted
rawhides
cooked
and
eaten
our
an
unexpected
supper
a
providential
food
supply
the
mail
company
went
down
fifty
miles
to
platte
bridge
to
winter
marshal
heywood
decided
to
remain
with
us
and
live
or
die
as
the
case
might
be
preferring
to
be
with
his
brethren
there
were
no
provisions
to
be
had
at
the
bridge
for
three
of
us
had
been
down
to
see
if
we
could
get
supplies
we
barely
got
enough
to
last
us
back
the
mountaineers
there
had
some
cattle
but
no
bread
they
lived
by
hunting
game
soon
became
so
scarce
that
we
could
kill
nothing
we
ate
all
the
poor
meat
one
would
get
hungry
eating
it
finally
that
was
all
gone
nothing
now
but
hides
were
left
we
made
a
trial
of
them
a
lot
was
cooked
and
eaten
without
any
seasoning
and
it
made
the
whole
company
sick
many
were
so
turned
against
the
stuff
that
it
made
them
sick
to
think
of
it
we
had
coffee
and
some
sugar
but
drinking
coffee
seemed
to
only
destroy
the
appetite
and
stimulate
for
only
a
little
while
one
man
became
delirious
from
drinking
so
much
of
it
things
looked
dark
for
nothing
remained
but
the
poor
raw
hides
taken
from
starved
cattle
we
asked
the
lord
to
direct
us
what
to
do
the
brethren
did
not
murmur
but
felt
to
trust
in
god
we
had
cooked
the
hide
after
soaking
and
scraping
the
hair
off
until
it
was
soft
and
then
ate
it
glue
and
all
this
made
it
rather
inclined
to
stay
with
us
longer
than
we
desired
finally
i
was
impressed
how
to
fix
the
stuff
and
gave
the
company
advice
telling
them
how
to
cook
it
for
them
to
scorch
and
scrape
the
hair
off
this
had
a
tendency
to
kill
and
purify
the
bad
taste
that
scalding
gave
it
after
scraping
boil
one
hour
in
plenty
of
water
throwing
the
water
away
which
had
extracted
all
the
glue
then
wash
and
scrape
the
hide
thoroughly
washing
in
cold
water
then
boil
to
a
jelly
and
let
it
get
cold
and
then
eat
with
a
little
sugar
sprinkled
on
it
this
was
considerable
trouble
but
we
had
little
else
to
do
and
it
was
better
than
starving
we
asked
the
lord
to
bless
our
stomachs
and
adapt
them
to
this
food
we
had
the
faith
to
ask
him
to
bless
the
for
it
was
hard
stock
on
eating
now
all
seemed
to
relish
the
feast
we
were
three
days
without
eating
before
this
second
attempt
was
made
we
enjoyed
this
sumptuous
fare
for
about
six
weeks
and
never
had
the
gout
in
february
the
first
indian
came
to
our
camp
he
was
of
the
snake
tribe
his
people
were
located
a
day
travel
up
the
river
at
the
time
of
his
arrival
we
were
out
of
everything
having
not
only
eaten
the
hides
taken
from
cattle
killed
but
had
eaten
the
wrappings
from
the
old
were
eaten
also
and
a
piece
of
buffalo
hide
that
had
been
used
for
a
foot
mat
for
two
months
the
day
the
indian
came
was
and
for
us
in
very
truth
we
met
as
usual
for
we
kept
our
monthly
during
meeting
we
became
impressed
that
there
were
some
wrongs
existing
among
the
brethren
in
camp
that
should
be
corrected
and
that
if
we
would
make
a
general
cleaning
up
and
present
our
case
before
the
lord
he
would
take
care
of
us
for
we
were
there
on
his
business
on
questioning
some
of
the
company
privately
we
found
that
several
had
goods
in
their
possession
not
belonging
to
them
when
we
felt
satisfied
all
goods
were
replaced
we
went
and
cut
a
hole
in
the
ice
on
the
river
there
were
several
carcasses
of
cattle
that
had
died
lying
near
the
fort
that
the
wolves
had
not
devoured
some
of
the
boys
contrary
to
counsel
had
cut
steaks
from
them
during
the
time
we
were
eating
the
hides
it
made
them
quite
sick
there
was
a
pile
of
offal
in
the
butcher
shop
from
the
poor
cattle
killed
but
what
looked
more
tempting
than
all
to
starving
men
was
a
pile
of
more
than
one
hundred
fat
wolf
carcasses
skinned
piled
up
and
frozen
near
the
fort
they
looked
very
much
like
nice
fat
mutton
many
of
the
company
asked
my
opinion
about
eating
them
i
told
them
if
they
would
all
do
as
i
advised
we
would
have
a
good
clean
supper
of
healthy
food
that
these
carcasses
were
unclean
that
we
were
on
the
lord
service
and
did
not
believe
he
wanted
us
to
suffer
so
much
if
we
only
had
faith
to
trust
him
and
ask
for
better
we
all
became
united
in
this
feeling
accordingly
we
hauled
all
these
carcasses
of
cattle
the
wolves
also
the
offal
from
the
and
shoved
them
into
the
hole
cut
in
the
ice
where
they
floated
off
out
of
our
reach
we
then
went
and
washed
out
our
and
presented
it
before
the
lord
empty
but
clean
near
sundown
the
indian
spoken
of
came
to
our
quarters
some
of
the
boys
hunted
up
a
small
piece
of
raw
hide
and
gave
it
to
him
he
said
he
had
eaten
it
before
none
of
us
were
able
to
talk
much
with
him
we
invited
him
to
remain
with
us
over
night
evening
came
on
and
no
supper
eight
no
word
from
any
one
and
the
word
had
been
positively
given
that
we
should
have
supper
between
eight
and
nine
all
were
sitting
waiting
now
and
then
saying
it
was
most
suppertime
no
one
seemed
disheartened
bro
heywood
was
still
with
us
all
at
once
we
heard
a
strange
noise
resembling
human
voices
down
the
road
bro
heywood
rushed
out
exclaiming
here
comes
our
supper
the
voices
were
loud
and
in
an
unknown
tongue
bro
came
back
a
little
frightened
saying
there
was
something
strange
going
on
down
the
road
several
of
us
taking
our
arms
started
in
the
direction
of
the
noise
on
getting
nearer
we
recognized
the
voices
the
magraw
party
under
jesse
jones
was
making
another
effort
to
get
through
with
their
coaches
they
had
got
stuck
in
a
snow
drift
and
the
noise
we
heard
was
canadian
frenchmen
swearing
at
their
mules
we
helped
them
out
and
guided
them
into
the
fort
it
was
a
bitter
cold
night
but
we
had
good
houses
with
rousing
fires
after
unhitching
and
turning
out
jesse
said
i
am
glad
to
get
here
i
replied
i
am
as
glad
to
see
you
why
are
you
so
glad
to
see
us
he
asked
i
told
him
we
had
not
a
mouthful
of
anything
to
eat
nor
had
we
tasted
food
that
day
then
what
are
you
stopping
here
for
i
replied
we
were
waiting
for
you
to
bring
our
supper
he
laughed
and
said
well
you
shall
have
it
if
it
takes
the
last
bite
we
have
got
he
gave
to
our
cook
all
of
his
provisions
about
ten
hungry
men
sat
down
to
about
as
thankfully
a
received
supper
as
was
ever
partaken
of
by
mortal
man
in
january
when
this
party
passed
through
to
platte
bridge
i
sent
word
by
them
to
the
mountaineers
there
that
we
would
pay
a
good
price
for
meat
brought
to
us
two
of
the
best
hunters
maxim
and
plant
made
the
attempt
to
get
us
meat
but
failed
almost
starving
themselves
on
the
hunt
they
never
reached
our
fort
but
returned
to
their
homes
on
the
platte
when
jesse
jones
left
us
going
down
we
had
but
little
provisions
on
hand
maxim
and
plant
failure
to
reach
us
with
food
caused
the
people
at
platte
bridge
to
suppose
we
had
all
perished
jesse
told
me
he
fully
expected
to
find
our
skeletons
some
may
ask
why
we
did
not
leave
there
was
no
time
during
the
winter
but
what
the
attempt
would
have
been
certain
death
to
some
of
us
the
company
at
no
time
was
strong
enough
to
make
the
trip
to
platte
bridge
neither
did
we
wish
to
abandon
our
trust
that
we
had
accepted
with
our
eyes
wide
open
to
the
perils
around
us
after
supper
we
found
there
was
scarcely
enough
left
for
breakfast
jesse
asked
what
we
proposed
doing
one
of
the
mail
company
a
frenchman
commenced
talking
with
the
indian
explaining
our
situation
to
him
he
said
their
camp
was
also
out
of
meat
that
they
were
hungry
and
that
he
was
out
prospecting
for
game
as
there
was
none
in
the
neighborhood
of
their
camp
but
he
thought
he
could
find
game
next
day
if
some
one
would
go
with
him
to
protect
him
from
the
crow
indians
who
were
supposed
to
be
in
the
direction
of
the
game
this
seemed
the
only
show
so
jesse
decided
to
lay
over
and
send
out
his
hunter
with
some
pack
animals
also
ten
of
our
company
the
stoutest
and
most
willing
they
no
doubt
would
have
fought
the
whole
crow
nation
to
have
protected
our
indian
friend
late
that
evening
the
frenchman
and
indian
came
into
the
fort
with
their
animals
loaded
with
good
buffalo
meat
i
asked
about
the
boys
of
our
company
who
went
out
on
foot
the
frenchman
answered
i
left
them
about
miles
from
here
roasting
and
eating
bones
and
entrails
they
are
all
right
they
got
in
next
day
each
man
loaded
with
meat
they
were
all
delighted
with
the
indian
telling
how
he
killed
the
buffalo
with
his
arrows
the
frenchman
shooting
first
and
wounding
the
animal
and
the
indian
doing
the
rest
these
indians
of
the
plains
years
back
killed
a
great
many
buffalo
with
arrows
they
would
stick
two
arrows
into
a
buffalo
heart
crossing
their
direction
so
that
as
the
buffalo
ran
these
arrows
would
work
and
cut
his
heart
almost
in
two
this
would
soon
bring
the
poor
brute
down
whereas
with
a
single
arrow
in
the
heart
they
would
run
a
long
distance

suffering
i
have
always
remembered
him
with
the
kindest
of
feelings
as
he
sometimes
remarks
rawhide
makes
a
strong
tie
the
indian
went
away
saying
he
would
tell
his
people
about
us
and
if
they
could
find
any
meat
they
would
divide
it
did
not
take
long
for
twenty
hungry
men
to
eat
up
our
supplies
about
the
of
march
the
last
morsel
had
been
eaten
for
breakfast
we
went
hunting
daily
sometimes
killing
a
little
small
game
but
nothing
of
account
our
provisions
were
exhausted
and
we
had
cleaned
up
everything
before
jesse
jones
came
to
our
relief
we
were
now
in
a
tight
place
there
was
a
set
of
harness
and
an
old
pack
saddle
covered
with
rawhide
still
on
hand
that
some
of
the
boys
considered
safe
to
depend
upon
for
a
few
days
still
we
had
great
hopes
of
getting
something
better
our
faith
had
been
much
strengthened
by
receiving
the
supplies
mentioned
as
usual
we
went
out
to
see
what
we
could
find
in
the
way
of
game
after
traveling
through
the
snow
for
several
miles
at
the
foot
of
the
mountains
we
saw
a
drove
of
mountain
sheep
they
were
standing
seemingly
entirely
off
their
guard
i
was
in
front
and
saw
the
sheep
as
i
supposed
before
they
did
me
we
dodged
down
out
of
sight
i
crept
to
a
large
rock
fully
expecting
to
get
meat
when
i
looked
to
get
a
shot
the
game
was
gone
i
could
see
it
making
for
the
top
of
the
mountain
we
watched
them
for
a
minute
or
two
and
they
were
soon
too
far
for
us
to
follow
my
heart
almost
failed
me
and
i
could
have
cried
like
a
child
for
i
knew
that
nothing
was
in
camp
when
we
left
and
our
comrades
expected
us
to
bring
something
for
supper
we
were
convinced
that
nothing
could
be
obtained
this
day
by
hunting
so
we
started
for
home
after
traveling
a
few
miles
we
struck
the
road
below
devil
gate
and
here
we
stopped
to
hold
a
council
as
will
be
remembered
our
instructions
from
brother
brigham
were
never
to
leave
the
fort
with
less
than
ten
men
there
never
had
been
a
time
when
we
had
that
many
men
able
to
stand
very
hard
service
sometimes
i
felt
like
disregarding
counsel
and
going
out
to
try
to
get
food
or
perish
in
the
attempt
but
up
to
this
time
we
had
all
followed
instructions
as
nearly
as
possible
now
here
was
a
trial
for
me
i
firmly
believed
i
could
go
on
foot
to
platte
bridge
and
get
something
to
save
the
lives
of
my
comrades
very
few
of
the
others
were
able
but
all
were
willing
to
go
with
me
i
told
them
if
counsel
had
to
be
broken
i
would
risk
no
one
but
myself
and
would
go
alone
the
boys
thought
they
could
live
five
days
before
starving
so
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
start
alone
next
morning
for
the
platte
bridge
i
had
now
been
one
day
without
food
it
would
take
two
more
to
reach
the
bridge
where
there
were
traders
as
the
snow
was
from
eighteen
inches
to
three
feet
deep
this
looked
a
little
hard
but
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
to
try
it
on
arriving
in
sight
of
camp
we
saw
a
number
of
horses
we
knew
some
one
had
arrived
but
had
no
idea
who
it
was
a
shout
of
joy
rang
out
from
our
crowd
that
made
the
hills
ring
all
mankind
were
friends
to
us
then
i
often
wonder
why
people
are
enemies
my
experience
in
life
with
a
few
exceptions
has
been
more
of
the
friendly
than
warlike
nature
i
have
been
fed
and
helped
by
all
classes
of
people
and
mankind
in
general
are
not
so
bad
when
properly
approached
the
new
arrivals
proved
to
be
the
first
company
of
the
x
express
with
william
hickman
in
charge
this
was
the
first
effort
of
this
firm
to
send
the
mail
through
several
old
acquaintances
were
along
and
of
course
we
were
rejoiced
to
see
them
especially
so
when
we
learned
they
had
a
good
supper
for
us
among
the
party
were
george
boyd
of
salt
lake
city
and
joshua
terry
of
draperville
a
day
or
two
before
their
arrival
brother
terry
had
killed
a
large
buffalo
and
they
packed
the
whole
of
it
into
our
camp
i
remember
about
the
first
thing
i
did
after
shaking
hands
was
to
drink
a
pint
of
strong
salty
broth
where
some
salt
pork
had
been
boiled
when
hickman
company
arrived
some
of
our
boys
were
getting
the
pack
saddle
soaked
up
ready
for
cooking
the
hide
covering
boyd
always
calls
me
the
man
that
ate
the
pack
saddle
but
this
is
slander
the
kindness
of
him
and
others
prevented
me
from
eating
my
part
of
it
i
think
if
they
had
not
arrived
probably
i
would
have
taken
a
or
but
do
think
i
would
have
eaten
the
whole
of
it
as
it
was
the
saddle
was
allowed
to
dry
up
again
and
may
be
in
existence
yet
and
doing
well
so
far
as
i
know
in
hickman
book
he
says
he
found
us
starving
with
plenty
of
provisions
in
store
houses
but
did
not
dare
to
take
them
that
on
his
arrival
he
burst
open
the
store
houses
and
told
us
to
help
ourselves
can
anyone
believe
such
stuff
if
all
his
book
is
like
this
for
truth
one
would
do
well
to
believe
the
reverse
hickman
left
about
the
of
march
going
on
east
ben
hampton
and
myself
started
to
go
on
to
platte
bridge
with
this
party
intending
to
get
some
supplies
if
possible
hickman
left
us
two
animals
and
with
one
of
ours
the
other
three
had
long
since
been
eaten
by
the
wolves
found
nearby
we
felt
ourselves
rich
we
had
gone
but
a
few
miles
when
we
met
some
men
from
the
platte
bringing
us
some
beef
they
had
heard
in
some
way
that
we
were
still
alive
i
think
the
indians
must
have
passed
the
word
they
could
not
get
buffalo
meat
so
had
killed
some
cattle
and
were
bringing
them
to
us
they
had
been
four
days
on
the
road
tramping
snow
and
working
through
drifts
expecting
to
find
us
starving
i
often
think
of
these
old
pioneers
who
were
always
so
ready
to
help
a
fellowman
in
need
we
bade
to
hickman
and
party
and
returned
to
the
fort
with
the
meat
we
paid
for
it
in
goods
from
brother
van
cott
boxes
paying
mostly
calico
and
domestic
they
charged
us
ten
cents
per
pound
which
was
very
cheap
considering
with
our
animals
and
meat
we
felt
quite
well
fitted
out
for
we
had
now
become
so
used
to
taking
what
we
could
get
thankfully
that
we
looked
upon
these
two
mules
left
us
as
sure
food
when
all
else
failed
while
jesse
jones
was
in
camp
one
of
his
men
gave
me
a
small
book
of
words
in
the
snake
language
i
expected
the
indians
around
and
studied
hard
every
day
soon
they
commenced
coming
in
to
see
us
there
were
over
one
hundred
lodges
of
snakes
and
bannocks
came
in
from
the
wind
river
country
and
camped
about
fifteen
miles
from
us
small
bands
camped
around
us
in
different
directions
they
soon
learned
we
were
short
of
provisions
the
first
party
that
brought
meat
to
us
wanted
to
charge
an
unreasonable
price
for
it
i
talked
with
them
quite
a
while
before
they
would
consent
to
sell
it
cheaper
they
said
that
they
themselves
were
hungry
showing
us
their
bare
arms
how
lean
they
were
but
i
told
them
it
was
not
just
to
take
advantage
of
our
circumstances
i
weighed
up
a
dollar
worth
of
meat
on
a
pair
of
spring
balances
marked
the
scales
plainly
and
told
them
i
would
give
no
more
they
consented
and
we
bought
hundreds
of
pounds
afterwards
without
more
trouble
in
buying
we
had
to
weigh
one
dollar
worth
at
a
time
no
matter
how
much
they
sold
us
we
exchanged
various
articles
with
them
many
of
the
company
trading
shirts
handkerchiefs
and
such
things
as
they
could
spare
we
had
some
coffee
for
which
the
indians
traded
readily
this
helped
us
out
for
a
short
season
but
game
became
so
scarce
that
this
camp
of
natives
several
hundred
had
to
move
out
or
starve
they
came
up
the
first
day
and
pitched
their
lodges
near
us
we
had
but
little
provisions
on
hand
some
meat
and
a
few
pounds
of
flour
that
we
used
to
thicken
our
broth
was
all
we
had
about
lost
our
appetite
for
bread
we
were
a
little
uneasy
to
have
all
these
hungry
indians
come
upon
us
at
once
the
greatest
care
had
to
be
taken
to
avoid
trouble
they
were
not
of
the
best
class
being
a
party
made
up
of
snakes
and
bannocks
who
had
left
their
regular
tribes
and
chiefs
and
joined
together
under
an
ambitious
young
fellow
named
tabawantooa
washakie
the
old
snake
chief
called
them
bad
men
there
was
one
little
party
under
an
old
petty
chief
toquatah
who
kept
apart
from
the
main
band
from
them
we
had
procured
most
of
our
meat
toquatah
had
informed
us
that
the
main
band
and
his
were
not
on
the
best
of
terms
and
that
tabawantooa
was
no
good
this
naturally
made
us
feel
a
little
uneasy
we
had
some
two
hundred
wagon
loads
of
valuable
goods
under
our
charge
and
only
twenty
men
the
greater
portion
of
them
with
no
frontier
experience
the
store
rooms
were
blocked
up
with
logs
and
had
been
all
winter
by
this
time
i
could
talk
considerable
snake
and
many
of
these
indians
understood
ute
tabawantooa
and
his
band
came
in
sight
of
our
quarters
about
noon
they
were
all
mounted
and
well
armed
the
chief
with
many
others
rode
up
in
quite
a
pompous
style
no
doubt
expecting
to
be
looked
upon
with
awe
and
treated
with
great
deference
i
had
time
to
get
my
wits
together
before
they
got
to
our
gate
where
an
armed
guard
was
stationed
brother
alexander
was
to
be
chief
cook
knowing
that
from
such
as
we
had
we
would
have
to
make
a
great
showing
of
hospitality
we
concluded
to
make
up
in
ceremony
what
was
lacking
in
food
so
all
the
and
were
filled
and
put
on
the
one
for
weak
soup
the
other
for
strong
coffee
we
had
plenty
of
the
latter
on
hand
the
company
were
instructed
to
go
into
their
rooms
shut
the
doors
keep
quiet
and
not
to
show
themselves
unless
ordered
to
do
so
brother
hampton
was
to
be
general
ready
for
any
emergency
i
was
to
meet
these
indians
outside
and
invite
them
in
the
gate
as
we
knew
the
chief
and
grandees
of
the
band
would
expect
to
be
entertained
soon
the
chief
with
some
fifty
others
rode
up
to
the
fort
while
hundreds
more
passed
on
a
short
distance
and
commenced
to
put
up
their
lodges
i
met
the
chief
shook
hands
and
asked
him
to
get
down
and
come
in
he
wanted
to
know
if
they
could
not
ride
inside
i
told
him
no
and
explained
to
him
that
we
had
a
lot
of
men
in
the
fort
who
were
afraid
of
indians
that
they
had
gone
into
their
houses
and
shut
the
doors
but
the
door
of
my
house
was
open
for
them
but
that
these
men
who
were
afraid
should
not
be
frightened
they
must
leave
their
horses
and
arms
outside
the
fort
this
the
chief
agreed
to
do
and
appointed
a
man
to
see
that
no
one
came
in
with
arms
soon
my
room
was
full
i
explained
to
the
chief
that
we
had
but
little
to
eat
and
could
not
entertain
many
but
half
we
had
they
were
welcome
to
i
talked
and
acted
as
though
we
were
glad
to
see
them
still
i
with
all
my
friendship
for
indians
would
have
been
willing
for
band
to
have
taken
another
road
brother
alexander
soon
had
plenty
of
weak
soup
and
strong
coffee
ready
cups
were
filled
and
the
feast
commenced
the
chief
sent
word
for
those
outside
to
go
on
to
camp
probably
seeing
his
rations
would
be
short
if
many
more
came
in
brother
hampton
kept
his
eye
on
things
in
general
and
would
come
in
and
report
from
time
to
time
all
except
one
respected
our
arrangements
indians
like
white
men
have
their
bullies
one
fellow
in
spite
of
the
guards
rode
into
fort
armed
brother
hampton
took
his
horse
by
the
bit
and
guided
him
back
out
of
the
gate
he
was
quite
saucy
but
went
out
all
right
we
were
asked
how
many
men
were
in
the
houses
i
told
them
great
many
they
then
wanted
to
know
if
the
men
had
guns
we
told
them
lots
which
was
a
fact
as
there
were
more
guns
than
men
indians
when
hungry
relish
anything
that
tightens
their
belts
so
our
friends
filled
and
emptied
their
cups
many
times
soon
all
who
had
remained
were
satisfied
bade
us
mounted
their
horses
and
started
to
their
camp
the
chief
inviting
us
to
go
up
and
take
supper
with
him
went
up
late
in
the
day
some
coffee
had
been
given
the
chief
and
at
supper
we
feasted
on
poor
antelope
meat
and
coffee
we
were
told
that
but
one
antelope
had
been
killed
that
day
and
the
chief
had
been
presented
with
it
the
whole
camp
were
about
out
of
food
except
thistle
roots
these
were
not
very
plentiful
as
we
had
already
dug
and
eaten
the
most
that
could
be
found
for
miles
around
our
quarters
these
natives
moved
on
next
morning
toquatah
band
being
still
in
the
rear
in
a
day
or
two
the
last
band
came
along
and
camped
near
us
we
were
glad
to
see
them
and
wanted
them
to
remain
near
us
but
they
were
afraid
of
the
crow
indians
and
desired
to
keep
in
the
vicinity
of
the
larger
band
for
protection
against
their
common
enemy
we
explained
to
them
our
destitute
condition
telling
them
that
we
were
again
about
out
of
provisions
and
would
be
sorry
to
have
them
leave
for
while
they
were
near
they
had
never
let
us
suffer
for
meat
next
morning
the
old
chief
said
he
would
go
out
twelve
miles
to
a
gap
in
the
mountains
and
camp
and
if
he
could
find
any
game
he
would
let
us
have
some
dried
meat
he
had
reserved
we
waited
a
day
and
then
went
to
see
if
our
friends
were
prospered
nothing
had
been
found
ten
of
us
stayed
all
night
with
the
indians
and
we
barely
got
enough
for
supper
and
breakfast
the
chief
told
us
to
go
back
home
he
would
move
on
a
little
farther
if
he
found
anything
he
would
send
it
to
us
his
spirit
towards
us
was
something
like
a
mother
with
a
lot
of
hungry
children
now
some
might
ask
why
we
did
not
do
our
own
hunting
and
not
depend
on
the
indians
an
indian
will
manage
to
kill
game
where
it
is
so
scarce
and
wild
that
but
few
white
men
would
even
see
it
we
were
much
safer
to
depend
upon
the
indians
as
long
as
they
were
around
in
the
country
again
they
considered
it
their
business
to
hunt
and
if
we
had
made
the
attempt
it
would
have
been
resented
by
them
we
went
home
feeling
a
little
sad
we
had
our
animals
but
did
not
wish
to
kill
them
still
we
felt
safe
as
long
as
mule
flesh
was
on
hand
to
our
joy
next
day
some
indians
came
from
their
camp
bringing
us
some
three
hundred
pounds
of
buffalo
meat
and
informing
us
that
they
had
seen
signs
of
game
and
if
we
would
come
to
them
the
next
morning
they
might
let
us
have
some
more
brother
hampton
and
i
saddled
up
taking
our
extra
animal
a
large
mule
and
started
for
our
friends
the
weather
was
still
cold
but
the
snow
was
mostly
gone
from
the
lowlands
it
being
now
near
the
first
of
april
when
we
arrived
at
their
camp
the
indians
were
just
starting
out
to
move
a
few
miles
further
towards
where
the
signs
of
buffalo
had
been
seen
brother
and
i
rode
along
with
them
chatting
with
the
old
chief
we
had
taken
a
few
things
with
us
to
trade
for
the
meat
we
camped
in
the
afternoon
some
thirty
miles
from
home
the
old
chief
called
out
and
soon
the
squaws
commenced
bringing
in
a
few
pounds
each
of
good
dried
meat
we
traded
for
about
three
hundred
pounds
all
our
mule
could
pack
and
about
all
the
indians
could
spare
this
of
course
was
all
we
could
expect
but
the
old
chief
said
maybe
they
could
do
more
for
us
in
the
morning
i
think
brother
hampton
and
i
really
enjoyed
ourselves
that
night
we
slept
in
a
lodge
ate
meat
and
drank
coffee
the
squaws
dirt
or
dogs
sticking
their
noses
into
the
meat
dishes
made
no
difference
to
us
or
if
it
did
we
ate
all
the
same
next
morning
after
breakfast
we
saddled
up
packing
our
dried
meat
on
the
mule
as
we
were
about
ready
to
start
there
was
quite
a
commotion
in
camp
we
thought
at
first
the
crow
indians
were
upon
us
but
the
old
chief
looking
in
an
easterly
direction
said
it
is
some
of
the
young
men
driving
a
buffalo
now
you
go
on
your
road
our
track
was
to
the
north
and
you
wilt
find
some
more
meat
ready
for
you
soon
we
started
and
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
probably
three
miles
when
we
found
the
buffalo
that
was
being
chased
had
been
run
into
our
trail
killed
and
made
ready
to
deliver
to
us
we
gave
them
some
few
things
we
had
left
and
they
loaded
both
of
our
saddle
animals
this
left
us
nearly
thirty
miles
to
go
afoot
we
did
not
mind
this
on
the
start
but
did
before
we
got
home
chapter
xvii
my
severe
toil
in
getting
to
camp
three
stray
cattle
come
to
the
fort
the
second
company
of
the
x
express
passes
us
our
hunt
for
the
cattle
two
days
travel
without
food
our
safe
return
to
camp
i
had
been
wearing
moccasins
all
winter
had
done
a
great
deal
of
walking
and
had
felt
well
and
strong
but
the
winter
had
commenced
to
break
and
there
was
mud
and
wet
snow
to
encounter
on
our
trip
someone
had
induced
me
to
put
on
a
pair
of
heavy
english
shoes
about
sundown
i
gave
out
got
so
lame
that
it
was
impossible
for
me
to
wear
the
shoes
and
travel
we
had
about
ten
miles
to
go
yet
and
no
trail
as
the
indian
trail
was
much
longer
than
to
cross
directly
over
the
country
and
we
wished
to
take
the
shortest
cut
moreover
there
was
still
a
few
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
part
of
the
way
on
the
most
direct
route
we
were
bent
on
getting
to
camp
that
night
if
possible
so
determined
to
keep
going
i
was
compelled
to
pull
off
my
stoggas
and
go
in
my
stocking
feet
this
did
very
well
till
the
snow
gave
out
which
it
did
as
we
got
on
to
lower
country
my
socks
soon
failed
then
and
the
ground
commenced
to
freeze
hard
traveling
became
slightly
unpleasant
to
me
i
put
on
the
shoes
again
but
could
not
possibly
walk
it
was
as
though
my
shin
bones
were
being
broken
at
every
step
some
may
wonder
why
my
companion
did
not
change
his
foot
gear
with
me
the
reason
was
he
wore
a
number
six
shoe
and
i
could
squeeze
on
a
number
ten
will
that
do
so
i
determined
to
go
it
now
became
really
unpleasant
for
the
country
was
spotted
with
prickly
pears
thorny
cactus
when
i
placed
my
number
ten
foot
pressed
down
by
my
body
on
these
desert
ornaments
they
had
a
piercing
effect
often
causing
me
to
halt
several
times
it
hurt
so
badly
that
i
dropped
desiring
to
take
a
seat
so
that
i
could
pull
the
thorns
out
of
my
feet
but
on
striking
the
ground
i
had
a
sudden
desire
to
rise
as
the
cactus
formed
the
only
place
to
sit
this
was
really
amusing
still
i
soon
had
enough
of
this
fun
and
commenced
to
figure
how
to
avoid
having
any
more
of
it
the
horses
dreaded
the
cactus
and
if
left
to
pick
the
road
would
avoid
them
so
we
allowed
them
to
go
ahead
i
carefully
watched
their
tracks
and
followed
them
getting
along
much
better
after
this
about
midnight
we
got
in
my
feet
a
little
the
worse
for
wear
but
so
happy
were
we
with
our
success
that
my
feet
soon
got
well
another
blessing
had
befallen
the
company
while
we
were
gone
three
large
work
oxen
one
wearing
a
big
bell
had
come
into
camp
these
cattle
had
traveled
nearly
one
hundred
miles
from
where
they
had
been
lost
they
were
in
fair
order
we
supposed
the
reason
why
the
wolves
had
not
killed
them
was
that
the
noise
of
the
bell
scared
them
away
with
the
meat
on
hand
and
these
cattle
we
felt
pretty
safe
for
the
balance
of
the
season
we
had
hopes
of
keeping
a
yoke
of
the
cattle
to
haul
wood
with
this
having
been
done
all
winter
with
a
light
wagon
ten
men
for
team
or
in
the
ice
was
melted
on
the
river
and
in
going
for
wood
it
had
to
be
waded
this
was
hard
on
the
boys
and
we
were
very
grateful
for
the
cattle
about
this
time
the
second
company
of
the
express
under
jet
stoddard
passed
down
they
had
but
little
to
spare
us
but
we
were
now
out
of
danger
we
got
a
little
flour
salt
and
bacon
the
word
was
that
the
next
company
would
bring
us
flour
the
most
of
us
had
got
so
we
cared
but
little
for
bread
if
we
could
have
plenty
of
meat
our
cattle
were
our
pets
now
we
hauled
up
a
lot
of
wood
the
grass
being
quite
good
off
toward
the
east
the
cattle
were
taken
out
every
day
at
night
someone
went
and
brought
them
in
and
corraled
them
our
horses
were
hoppled
in
sight
of
camp
where
they
ran
day
and
night
one
evening
the
boys
who
went
for
the
oxen
came
in
rather
late
without
them
saying
that
they
could
not
hear
the
bell
we
supposed
they
had
laid
down
for
the
night
still
we
were
anxious
as
our
meat
was
about
out
and
we
expected
to
soon
butcher
the
fattest
of
them
early
next
morning
brother
hampton
and
i
saddled
up
and
started
out
before
breakfast
to
hunt
the
cattle
not
expecting
to
be
gone
more
than
an
hour
we
soon
struck
their
trail
going
east
most
of
the
time
showing
they
were
on
the
move
not
often
feeding
at
sundown
we
were
about
thirty
miles
from
camp
still
trailing
and
tolerably
hungry
but
that
trail
not
be
we
followed
on
the
tracks
running
almost
parallel
with
the
road
but
gradually
nearing
it
it
now
became
too
dark
to
see
the
trail
we
were
continually
expecting
to
hear
the
bell
but
no
bell
sounded
we
continued
in
the
same
direction
until
we
reached
the
main
road
after
following
it
a
short
distance
brother
hampton
dismounted
and
felt
for
tracks
he
soon
decided
that
the
cattle
were
now
on
the
road
as
he
could
feel
the
tracks
where
the
ground
had
been
lately
disturbed
the
road
being
dry
and
soft
in
places
thus
we
continued
to
travel
for
some
four
or
five
miles
feeling
for
tracks
at
length
we
came
to
a
gulch
crossing
the
road
several
feet
deep
and
full
of
snow
we
could
see
where
the
cattle
had
crossed
as
the
moon
was
now
up
and
we
could
trail
quite
well
but
on
attempting
to
cross
the
drift
we
sank
down
at
this
season
of
the
year
these
freeze
in
the
night
time
thawing
out
in
the
afternoon
and
gradually
melting
away
so
that
from
noon
until
after
midnight
it
is
impossible
for
a
horse
to
cross
them
men
often
crossing
on
hands
and
knees
or
if
the
snow
is
quite
soft
lying
down
and
rolling
across
this
we
could
have
done
but
our
horses
did
not
feel
as
anxious
as
we
did
to
go
on
so
when
we
proposed
to
them
to
roll
across
the
drift
they
pretended
not
to
understand
us
we
followed
up
the
drift
for
quite
a
distance
but
it
remained
the
same
white
streak
of
snow
as
far
as
we
could
see
by
moonlight
so
we
concluded
to
turn
in
until
morning
when
the
snow
would
be
hardened
it
was
now
getting
quite
chilly
we
had
eaten
nothing
all
day
all
the
bedding
we
had
was
a
couple
of
small
saddle
blankets
and
there
was
nothing
to
make
a
fire
with
but
a
little
green
sagebrush
but
if
there
had
been
fuel
we
would
have
been
afraid
to
light
a
fire
as
the
crow
indians
were
in
the
country
and
might
steal
our
horses
we
went
to
ground
but
did
not
sleep
much
it
soon
became
so
cold
that
we
almost
froze
to
death
when
we
thought
the
snow
was
hard
enough
we
got
up
but
were
so
chilled
we
could
not
saddle
our
horses
we
were
almost
lifeless
and
commenced
stirring
about
to
bring
life
back
we
commenced
bumping
against
each
other
sometimes
knocking
one
another
down
we
got
to
laughing
at
the
ridiculousness
of
our
actions
more
life
returned
our
teeth
began
chattering
and
our
bodies
shaking
but
we
kept
up
this
jostling
each
other
until
we
started
circulation
and
were
able
to
saddle
up
and
go
on
it
was
daylight
before
we
got
thawed
out
we
walked
until
we
got
well
warmed
up
the
trail
following
right
on
the
road
about
ten
we
found
the
cattle
they
had
finally
turned
off
the
road
to
feed
we
were
now
about
miles
from
home
the
first
thing
i
proposed
after
finding
the
cattle
was
to
cut
their
tails
off
tie
a
string
around
the
stubs
to
keep
them
from
bleeding
roast
the
tails
and
eat
them
for
i
felt
wolfish
ben
objected
saying
it
might
weaken
the
cattle
and
that
he
believed
we
could
stand
it
back
home
that
the
cattle
were
good
travelers
and
may
be
we
could
reach
the
fort
by
midnight
our
horses
or
rather
horse
and
mule
as
i
will
soon
have
to
deal
a
little
with
a
mule
it
will
not
do
to
call
him
a
horse
now
were
all
right
having
been
on
good
feed
the
night
before
the
cattle
on
being
turned
back
took
the
road
in
good
shape
starting
on
a
trot
we
were
anxious
to
get
back
and
cross
the
snowdrift
before
it
softened
up
this
we
succeeded
in
doing
and
continued
traveling
until
after
noon
before
bating
we
had
more
sympathy
for
ourselves
than
for
our
animals
for
we
were
getting
a
little
hungry
and
dreaded
the
thought
of
having
to
go
to
ground
again
so
we
kept
up
our
speed
finally
ben
mule
began
to
weaken
we
had
considerable
trouble
to
get
it
along
but
by
one
leading
and
the
other
walking
and
whipping
we
got
to
independence
rock
where
there
were
three
or
four
men
camped
in
some
old
houses
this
was
about
six
miles
from
our
fort
here
we
had
a
trial
i
think
few
men
would
have
stood
as
we
rode
up
they
had
a
good
fire
burning
a
nice
supper
cooked
and
were
just
ready
to
commence
eating
they
had
stayed
the
night
before
at
our
camp
where
they
had
arrived
destitute
and
out
of
provisions
brother
alexander
had
told
them
about
us
our
company
was
very
anxious
about
us
they
had
given
these
poor
fellows
what
provisions
they
could
spare
enough
to
last
them
to
platte
bridge
provided
they
made
the
trip
in
reasonable
time
one
of
the
party
had
frozen
his
feet
and
was
suffering
terribly
we
soon
learned
their
condition
but
they
insisted
on
us
eating
supper
we
thought
of
the
poor
lame
fellow
getting
out
of
food
we
were
within
six
miles
of
home
so
we
pretended
that
we
were
not
very
hungry
and
advised
them
to
be
careful
of
what
they
had
and
we
would
go
on
home
the
smell
of
the
food
to
us
was
like
piercing
our
stomachs
with
a
dagger
it
was
really
hard
to
refuse
taking
a
few
bites
but
we
did
when
we
had
got
about
half
way
home
i
went
ahead
with
the
cattle
ben
driving
the
tired
mule
i
wished
to
get
in
and
have
supper
ready
by
the
time
my
comrade
arrived
which
i
did
not
suppose
would
be
over
one
half
hour
on
arriving
at
the
fort
most
of
the
company
were
up
waiting
in
suspense
our
arrival
brother
alexander
had
a
camp
kettle
full
of
meat
and
soup
with
dumplings
ready
it
was
rations
for
seven
men
he
had
kept
it
warm
all
day
and
commenced
to
dish
some
up
for
me
but
i
told
him
that
i
would
not
eat
a
bite
until
ben
came
it
was
more
than
an
hour
before
he
arrived
the
mule
having
broken
loose
and
ran
away
from
him
and
he
had
been
following
it
finally
he
arrived
bringing
the
mule
and
feeling
very
much
like
beefing
it
when
he
got
home
all
now
was
ready
for
our
supper
we
sat
down
on
some
wolf
skins
before
the
fire
the
in
reach
and
commenced
to
eat
but
not
hurriedly
before
daylight
we
had
emptied
the
kettle
we
relished
this
feast
fully
and
did
not
suffer
any
inconvenience
both
of
us
were
well
and
feeling
first
rate
next
day
after
having
a
good
sleep
as
the
cattle
were
so
much
bother
we
concluded
to
kill
them

another

under

and
john

arrived
going

they
gave
us
a
little
flour
and
other
provisions
they
also
brought
us
letters
telling
us
when
the

train
would
arrive
with

and

this
company
furnished
us
we
felt
safe

supplies
until
time
for
the
relief
trains
here
i
will
give
an
account
of
a
little
personal
matter
that
may
seem
like
boasting
but
i
do
not
intend
it
so
this
company
stayed
with
us
two
nights
they
were
picked
men
thirty
in
number
tough
boys
on
hearing
of
our
sufferings
many
remarks
were
made
showing
deep
sympathy
for
us
at
this
time
we
were
well
recruited
having
had
plenty
of
meat
for
some
time
but
scarcely
any
flour
for
some
five
months
bread
we
had
hardly
tasted
in
fact
the
first
biscuit
i
got
almost
choked
me
i
had
entirely
lost
my
appetite
for
it
the
morning
the
company
were
getting
ready
to
start
on
a
young
man
eldredge
who
was
going
down
as
a
passenger
expressed
much
indignation
saying
that
there
could
be
no
excuse
for
leaving
men
to
suffer
as
we
had
i
did
not
like
to
hear
this
said
for
i
knew
there
were
justifiable
reasons
for
leaving
us
to
take
care
of
the
goods
i
also
knew
brothers
grant
and
burton
would
have
sent
us
help
if
they
could
it
was
expected
that
the
cattle
left
would
have
been
better
beef
than
they
turned
out
to
be
i
had
neither
time
nor
disposition
to
explain
all
these
things
so
to
stop
the
talk
that
i
had
got
a
little
tired
of
hearing
i
said
to
eldredge
we
do
not
need
your
sympathy
we
are
all
right
now
none
of
us
have
died
and
i
am
a
better
man
than
any
of
your
company
picked
men
as
you
are
how
do
you
propose
to
prove
this
jones
will
you
pull
sticks
with
our
best
man
i
will
not
allow
you
fellows
to
banter
the
boys
that
way
i
was
a
little
fearful
that
i
was
sold
for
i
knew
there
were
some
stout
men
in
their
company
but
as
the
banter
was
made
to
back
out
would
be
worse
than
to
get
beat
so
i
said
bring
him
on
i
will
hoist
him
eldredge
came
back
with
john
murdock
who
was
smiling
now
i
really
wished
i
had
not
made
the
banter
for
john
was
an
old
friend
who
was
hard
to
pull
up
a
ring
was
formed
both
companies
helping
to
form
a
circle
rawhide
against
corn
was
the
cry
we
sat
down
and
got
an
even
start
it
was
a
hard
pull
but
rawhide
won
and
we
got
no
more
pity
from
that
company
making
a
close
estimate
of
the
food
we
now
had
we
found
it
would
last
us
till
the
promised
provisions
could
arrive
which
would
be
about
the
of
may
there
were
twenty
of
us
now
we
quit
rationing
and
ate
all
we
wanted
as
may
be
imagined
some
big
eating
was
done
now
the
food
soon
began
to
diminish
very
fast
at
this
time
we
could
go
to
the
platte
bridge
and
get
provisions
but
on
calling
the
company
together
all
hands
agreed
to
make
the
meat
last
by
again
rationing
we
could
do
this
quite
easily
allowing
one
and
a
half
pounds
per
day
we
lived
a
few
days
on
these
rations
and
all
seemed
content
one
day
brother
hampton
and
i
were
out
and
on
returning
to
the
fort
we
learned
that
a
small
herd
of
buffalo
had
been
seen
passing
within
three
miles
of
the
fort
all
hands
were
excited
as
they
were
the
first
seen
for
a
long
time
the
boys
were
all
sure
that
ben
and
i
could
get
meat
and
we
could
again
go
to
feasting
we
started
out
and
soon
came
in
sight
of
the
buffalo
feeding
we
dismounted
and
crept
close
to
them
but
just
as
we
got
in
shooting
distance
it
commenced
to
snow
so
hard
that
we
could
not
see
to
shoot
with
any
certainty
we
sat
there
trying
to
get
sight
of
a
buffalo
until
our
fingers
were
too
much
benumbed
to
hold
our
guns
i
had
brought
an
extra
gun
in
anticipation
of
having
to
chase
the
buffalo
on
horseback
we
concluded
to
blaze
away
hit
or
miss
and
then
take
to
our
horses
and
have
a
running
shot
at
the
crack
of
our
guns
all
the
herd
ran
away
we
mounted
and
started
in
pursuit
the
horse
i
was
riding
could
easily
outrun
the
buffalo
but
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
get
him
up
along
side
of
one
when
i
would
follow
straight
behind
he
would
get
within
about
yards
but
when
i
would
try
to
get
him
up
nearer
he
would
bolt
and
run
off
to
one
side
this
game
we
kept
up
for
some
time
occasionally
the
buffalo
would
get
two
or
three
hundred
yards
away
from
me
when
the
horse
would
start
in
after
them
and
soon
run
up
to
about
the
same
distance
then
he
would
bolt
again
i
felt
almost
like
blowing
his
brains
out
i
finally
commenced
shooting
at
the
buffalo
but
to
no
purpose
as
none
were
killed
we
had
to
give
up
the
chase
and
go
home
without
meat
feeling
quite
chagrined
we
had
not
been
in
camp
long
until
i
was
informed
that
there
was
a
great
dissatisfaction
being
manifested
by
some
of
the
company
about
the
rations
i
immediately
called
the
company
together
to
see
what
was
the
trouble
several
expressed
themselves
quite
freely
finding
fault
for
being
rationed
when
provisions
could
now
be
had
and
saying
that
they
thought
i
ought
to
go
and
get
something
to
eat
and
not
have
them
suffer
any
more
this
grieved
me
very
much
as
i
had
a
kindly
feeling
towards
all
the
company
we
had
suffered
everything
that
men
could
suffer
and
live
we
had
often
been
on
the
point
of
starvation
sometimes
becoming
so
weak
that
we
could
scarcely
get
our
firewood
having
to
go
some
distance
to
the
mountain
for
it
we
were
now
all
in
good
health
and
had
as
i
understood
willingly
agreed
to
be
rationed
for
a
few
days
until
relief
came
from
salt
lake
city
i
did
not
care
so
much
for
the
trouble
of
going
for
provisions
but
i
felt
a
great
deal
of
pride
in
the
grit
of
the
company
and
this
was
a
sore
disappointment
for
me
for
no
one
had
just
reason
to
find
fault
all
i
said
was
well
brethren
i
will
go
and
get
you
all
you
want
now
pitch
in
and
eat
your
fill
i
will
have
more
by
the
time
you
eat
up
what
is
on
hand
brother
hampton
felt
very
indignant
at
the
faultfinders
he
told
them
that
they
would
soon
be
ashamed
of
themselves
spoke
of
the
hardships
we
had
endured
uncomplainingly
and
of
the
hard
labors
in
hunting
and
many
efforts
made
to
keep
alive
now
when
we
were
about
through
and
no
one
suffering
some
had
shown
their
true
colors
and
marred
their
credit
for
being
true
men
ben
got
warm
and
finally
said
you
will
regret
this
instead
of
having
to
wait
twelve
days
there
will
be
plenty
of
provisions
here
inside
of
twelve
hours
and
then
you
will
wish
you
had
kept
still
at
this
he
ceased
talking
sat
down
and
turned
to
me
saying
a
little
excitedly
what
do
think
will
it
come
i
said
yes
for
i
felt
the
prophecy
would
be
fulfilled
sure
enough
that
same
evening
twenty
men
arrived
at
our
camp
bringing
nearly
a
ton
of
flour
and
other
provisions
this
company
had
been
sent
to
strengthen
our
post
they
informed
us
that
there
was
a
large
company
of
apostates
on
the
road
led
by
tom
williams
before
leaving
salt
lake
some
of
this
company
had
made
threats
that
indicated
danger
to
us
the
circumstances
leading
to
the
threats
were
these
the
goods
we
were
guarding
belonged
to
the
last
season
emigrants
the
wagon
companies
freighting
them
through
agreed
to
deliver
them
in
salt
lake
city
these
goods
were
to
be
taken
in
and
delivered
as
by
contract
some
of
the
owners
had
become
dissatisfied
with
mormonism
and
were
going
back
to
the
states
as
their
goods
had
not
arrived
in
salt
lake
city
they
demanded
that
they
should
be
delivered
at
devil
gate
quite
a
number
settled
their
freight
bills
and
brought
orders
for
their
goods
and
received
them
all
right
others
refused
to
settle
but
threatened
that
if
the
goods
were
not
given
up
they
would
take
them
by
force
tom
williams
company
was
composed
largely
of
this
class
and
their
backers
they
numbered
about
fifty
men
the
twenty
men
coming
to
our
relief
were
sent
under
the
emergency
this
is
the
way
brother
hampton
prophecy
came
to
be
fulfilled
tom
williams
knew
nothing
of
this
company
as
they
had
slipped
out
and
got
ahead
of
him
and
arrived
long
enough
before
him
for
us
to
get
everything
ready
we
now
had
forty
men
well
armed
the
twenty
sent
us
being
picked
for
the
occasion
as
i
can
not
remember
all
their
names
i
will
simply
say
for
the
purpose
they
were
all
men
our
old
company
were
reliable
as
ben
had
said
they
would
be
they
were
a
little
ashamed
but
nothing
farther
was
said
and
the
boys
showed
their
repentance
by
doing
their
duties
now
our
instructions
were
to
deliver
no
goods
to
anyone
unless
they
presented
an
order
from
the
right
parties
when
williams
company
arrived
they
made
camp
near
our
fort
most
of
our
men
were
kept
out
of
sight
there
were
rooms
each
side
of
the
front
door
where
we
had
a
guard
placed
a
person
that
claimed
a
lot
of
goods
had
come
on
the
evening
before
and
presented
an
order
that
was
not
genuine
he
had
reported
to
his
friends
our
refusing
to
let
him
have
his
goods
soon
williams
and
a
few
others
came
up
and
said
if
we
did
not
give
up
the
goods
that
they
would
tear
down
the
fort
or
have
them
williams
was
well
known
to
most
of
us
by
marriage
he
was
my
wife
uncle
i
informed
him
that
we
intended
to
obey
instructions
he
raved
and
threatened
considerable
but
to
no
purpose
he
started
to
his
camp
with
the
avowed
intention
of
returning
and
taking
the
goods
i
now
got
my
company
ready
for
fight
if
necessary
we
had
prepared
port
holes
in
front
of
the
fort
and
here
i
stationed
some
of
the
best
shots
brothers
hampton
and
alexander
took
charge
of
our
company
the
company
that
came
to
strengthen
us
working
together
under
their
leader
soon
we
saw
tom
williams
approaching
with
his
backers
as
he
supposed
double
our
number
but
in
reality
near
the
same
i
did
not
wish
blood
shed
and
fully
believed
that
tom
was
playing
a
bluff
so
concluded
to
try
and
beat
him
at
the
game
i
instructed
some
of
the
best
marksmen
what
to
do
in
case
shooting
had
to
be
done
as
williams
approached
i
went
out
alone
and
stood
about
thirty
yards
from
the
fort
having
only
my
pistol
as
the
company
came
up
near
me
i
placed
my
hand
on
my
pistol
and
told
them
to
halt
they
halted
but
commenced
to
threaten
and
abuse
the
whole
fraternity
sparing
none
i
explained
our
situation
being
simply
custodians
of
the
goods
not
knowing
whose
they
were
but
only
knew
who
left
us
there
and
we
could
not
consistently
recognize
any
orders
except
from
those
under
whose
instructions
we
were
acting
my
reasoning
had
no
effect
whatever
but
tom
called
on
his
crowd
to
say
if
the
goods
should
be
taken
the
vote
was
to
take
them
now
that
no
one
may
suppose
that
i
wish
to
appear
brave
i
will
say
that
the
way
i
had
my
men
placed
and
the
instructions
given
if
a
weapon
had
been
drawn
on
me
half
williams
company
would
have
been
shot
dead
before
i
could
have
been
harmed
i
said
to
williams
just
hold
on
one
minute
and
hear
what
i
have
to
say
we
have
been
here
all
winter
eating
poor
beef
and
raw
hide
to
take
care
of
these
goods
we
have
had
but
little
fun
and
would
just
as
soon
have
some
now
as
not
in
fact
would
like
a
little
row
if
you
think
you
can
take
the
fort
just
try
it
but
i
do
think
you
can
take
me
to
commence
with
and
the
first
one
that
offers
any
violence
to
me
is
a
dead
man
now
i
dare
you
to
go
past
me
towards
the
fort
this
seemed
to
take
them
back
i
meant
what
i
said
and
some
of
them
knew
my
disposition
which
in
those
days
was
not
the
most
when
a
white
man
was
before
me
as
an
enemy
after
looking
at
me
a
moment
tom
said
for
your
family
sake
i
will
spare
you
for
i
think
you
d
d
fool
enough
to
die
before
you
would
give
up
the
goods
i
thanked
him
and
said
i
believed
as
he
did
after
this
we
had
no
more
trouble
many
times
i
have
thought
i
should
have
shown
our
force
openly
to
have
deterred
williams
but
he
was
such
a
known
bully
and
so
conceited
that
i
felt
just
like
taking
him
down
a
notch
and
this
did
it
chapter
xix
ample
food
supplies
arrive
i
go
to
salt
lake
city
my
report
to
president
young
he
approves
it
i
am
accused
of
stealing
my
vindication
the
wagons
being
sent
out
for
the
goods
soon
began
to
arrive
provisions
were
not
in
question
now
as
we
had
plenty
there
was
also
a
big
company
levi
stewart
in
charge
going
down
to
stock
the
road
and
a
company
of
elders
traveling
with
came
through
from
salt
lake
city
it
was
about
one
week
from
the
first
arrival
until
the
last
of
these
arrived
president
young
had
sent
me
several
letters
containing
instructions
of
various
kinds
pertaining
to
my
duties
but
one
particular
letter
of
definite
instructions
how
to
arrange
many
things
had
not
arrived
i
kept
waiting
for
it
as
there
were
many
things
to
do
that
i
had
no
instructions
about
i
kept
enquiring
but
no
letter
came
finally
all
were
in
i
asked
some
of
the
older
and
more
experienced
elders
what
i
should
do
their
answer
was
that
they
were
also
expecting
instructions
and
that
they
were
more
in
need
of
counsel
than
able
to
give
it
there
were
over
two
hundred
teams
now
on
the
ground
many
of
the
owners
beginning
to
get
impatient
at
the
delay
i
was
at
a
loss
what
to
do
so
i
went
out
after
night
and
asked
the
lord
to
help
me
out
i
told
him
i
desired
to
do
exactly
what
was
best
but
did
not
know
a
thing
about
it
and
made
this
proposition
that
i
would
take
my
clerk
with
me
in
the
morning
and
when
a
question
was
asked
me
by
any
one
what
to
do
i
would
tell
the
clerk
to
write
down
just
what
first
came
to
my
mind
and
if
that
was
right
to
please
remove
the
spirit
of
oppression
that
i
was
laboring
under
and
allow
me
to
go
back
to
the
fort
and
enjoy
myself
with
my
friends
my
mind
was
at
once
entirely
relieved
i
went
and
passed
a
pleasant
evening
next
morning
without
saying
anything
about
the
lack
of
instructions
we
commenced
business
soon
some
one
asked
whose
teams
were
to
be
loaded
first
i
dictated
to
my
clerk
thus
we
continued
as
fast
as
the
clerk
put
them
down
orders
would
be
given
and
we
passed
on
to
the
next
we
continued
this
for
four
days
everything
that
i
felt
to
be
my
duty
was
done
all
the
teams
were
loaded
up
companies
organized
and
started
back
men
detailed
to
remain
a
while
longer
elders
furnished
flour
and
a
great
deal
of
business
was
done
a
memorandum
was
kept
of
all
this
i
hitched
up
a
team
and
started
for
home
when
everything
was
in
shape
i
reached
salt
lake
city
a
few
hours
ahead
of
the
freight
teams
and
went
to
president
young
office
he
was
very
glad
to
see
me
expressing
much
sympathy
and
saying
that
if
he
had
known
of
our
suffering
in
time
he
would
have
sent
us
supplies
at
any
cost
i
acted
a
little
stiff
for
i
did
not
know
whether
my
management
of
the
last
business
would
be
approved
of
or
not
but
i
was
determined
to
defend
my
actions
for
i
knew
i
had
done
the
best
i
could
soon
brother
young
asked
me
if
i
had
attended
to
everything
in
order
before
leaving
my
reply
was
i
hope
i
did
but
do
not
know
well
you
acted
according
to
my
instructions
did
you
not
i
do
know
i
did
not
get
any
instructions
and
it
was
pretty
hard
on
me
i
handed
him
my
book
saying
here
is
a
report
of
what
we
did
i
hope
it
is
satisfactory
brother
brigham
asked
his
clerk
brown
about
the
letter
of
instructions
brother
brown
said
a
few
days
after
the
last
of
these
companies
left
in
looking
over
his
papers
he
found
a
letter
directed
to
jones
it
was
the
letter
that
should
have
been
sent
brother
brigham
commenced
reading
my
report
and
as
he
read
would
remark
that
is
right
this
is
right
well
you
seemed
to
get
along
all
right
i
began
to
feel
pretty
good
finally
brother
brown
was
told
to
look
over
the
letter
which
was
very
large
containing
many
items
of
special
instructions
my
report
agreed
with
the
whole
of
it
this
confirmed
me
more
than
ever
in
my
faith
in
inspiration
also
in
the
honesty
of
brigham
young
and
his
counseling
for
if
his
instructions
had
not
been
honest
i
would
never
have
been
inspired
to
anticipate
them
the
trouble
lies
with
us
we
many
times
want
to
dictate
the
inspiration
or
in
other
words
put
forward
our
own
ideas
and
desires
and
call
them
inspirations
i
met
my
in
salt
lake
city
and
heard
from
my
wife
and
two
children
who
were
living
with
father
colton
in
provo
we
started
for
home
the
next
day
where
i
met
my
family
after
so
long
and
severe
a
trip
it
was
with
joy
and
thankfulness
that
i
greeted
my
wife
who
was
one
of
the
best
and
most
faithful
wives
that
ever
blessed
a
husband
this
was
the
spring
after
what
is
known
as
the
winter
of
the
reformation
the
reformation
move
was
doubtless
intended
for
and
resulted
in
good
but
like
everything
else
where
good
is
found
the
devil
comes
along
to
see
what
up
so
it
was
nothing
strange
if
while
browsing
around
he
had
a
hand
in
some
of
the
moves
of
men
this
i
soon
became
satisfied
was
the
case
now
and
i
did
not
take
much
stock
in
what
some
people
called
reformation
when
i
left
devil
gate
it
was
with
the
understanding
that
i
was
to
return
there
and
take
charge
of
the
place
as
a
station
but
brother
brigham
countermanded
the
order
saying
that
i
had
had
enough
of
devil
gate
for
one
man
as
i
was
so
sure
of
going
back
when
i
left
devil
gate
i
had
left
my
gun
saddle
a
wagon
that
i
had
traded
for
as
well
as
a
lot
of
carriage
springs
that
i
had
gathered
up
in
these
days
there
were
many
things
thrown
away
on
the
plains
that
were
of
value
and
it
was
profitable
to
go
back
with
teams
and
gather
up
wagon
tires
and
other
things
which
had
been
abandoned
i
spoke
to
brother
brigham
about
this
he
said
he
wished
me
to
stop
in
the
city
long
enough
to
help
deliver
the
goods
to
the
owners
patrick
lynch
and
myself
were
appointed
to
take
charge
of
them
i
soon
learned
that
strange
stories
had
been
put
in
circulation
about
me
i
was
accused
of
stealing
and
hiding
away
thousands
of
worth
of
goods
as
there
was
no
communication
between
us
and
the
valley
how
this
started
was
a
mystery
only
to
be
accounted
for
by
imaginations
so
strong
was
the
belief
in
my
guilt
that
about
the
time
the
reformation
was
at
its
height
in
provo
a
teacher
came
to
visit
my
wife
telling
her
that
she
ought
to
leave
me
and
marry
some
good
man
i
could
give
the
name
of
the
teacher
but
he
is
now
dead
so
i
will
spare
his
memory
my
wife
answered
well
i
will
not
leave
daniel
jones
i
can
not
better
myself
for
if
he
will
steal
there
is
not
an
honest
man
on
earth
i
always
appreciated
the
answer
one
family
who
i
will
also
spare
as
are
not
yet
dead
came
to
search
my
house
for
stolen
goods
but
did
not
find
any
they
professed
to
be
very
sorry
for
having
come
my
wife
treated
them
with
perfect
civility
no
doubt
they
were
ashamed
of
themselves
and
are
to
this
day
when
they
think
of
the
indignity
while
delivering
their
goods
i
was
often
accused
of
having
robbed
people
the
goods
formerly
spoken
of
being
divided
to
were
never
replaced
and
i
had
to
bear
the
blame
again
before
the
trains
had
stopped
in
the
so
i
was
informed
by
some
of
the
brethren
who
stayed
at
devil
gate
there
had
been
a
number
of
heavy
boxes
emptied
the
goods
stuffed
into
sacks
and
the
boxes
broken
up
for
firewood
the
owners
of
course
looked
in
vain
for
their
boxes
many
sacks
of
goods
remained
at
the
tithing
office
for
a
long
time
before
being
identified
by
the
owners
of
the
goods
i
believe
the
most
of
these
articles
finally
got
where
they
belonged
but
in
the
meantime
i
was
paddy
miles
boy
who
had
done
all
the
mischief
brother
lynch
felt
so
indignant
that
he
reported
these
accusations
to
president
young
when
i
received
the
following
letter
president
office
great
salt
lake
city
june
the
bishops
and
presidents
in
beloved
brethren
inasmuch
as
there
are
some
persons
disposed
to
find
fault
with
the
management
of
brother
daniel
jones
while
at
devil
gate
we
feel
desirous
to
express
ourselves
perfectly
satisfied
with
his
labors
while
there
and
with
the
care
that
he
has
taken
of
the
property
intrusted
to
him
he
has
our
confidence
and
we
say
god
bless
him
for
what
he
has
done
the
men
who
find
fault
with
the
labors
of
brother
jones
the
past
winter
we
wish
their
names
sent
to
this
office
and
when
the
lord
presents
an
opportunity
we
will
try
them
and
see
if
they
will
do
any
better

my
trading
trip
president
young
asks
me
to
meet
some
false
charges
wicked
reports
concerning
me
their
unjustness
made
manifest
the
president
stern
reproof
to
my
accusers
an
excellent
recommend
my
wife
remained
in
the
city
with
me
during
the
time
we
were
delivering
the
goods
some
three
weeks
after
getting
through
i
in
company
with
roberts
of
provo
fitted
up
a
team
and
went
back
to
trade
roberts
remained
at
the
south
pass
while
i
went
down
with
two
yoke
of
oxen
to
devil
gate
it
maybe
interesting
to
some
to
give
a
brief
description
of
my
trip
going
down
some
ninety
miles
stephen
markham
was
in
charge
of
the
station
at
the
south
pass
he
had
nine
head
of
good
milk
cows
in
charge
which
he
had
orders
to
send
to
devil
gate
for
the
use
of
men
stationed
there
he
offered
to
furnish
me
a
horse
if
i
would
drive
them
down
this
was
agreeable
as
i
would
have
had
to
foot
it
otherwise
as
i
could
not
carry
provisions
very
well
and
having
money
it
was
supposed
that
i
could
buy
bread
at
least
as
there
were
trains
of
california
emigrants
continually
on
the
road
cups
were
scarce
so
when
i
started
out
i
had
nothing
but
my
blankets
and
gun
i
happened
to
have
a
new
clay
pipe
in
my
pocket
after
asking
several
persons
to
sell
me
a
cup
and
some
bread
and
being
refused
concluded
to
see
if
i
could
not
get
through
with
what
i
had
the
cows
all
gave
plenty
of
milk
and
were
gentle
i
necessarily
had
to
milk
them
to
keep
their
udders
from
spoiling
so
when
i
would
get
a
cow
all
milked
but
the
strippings
i
would
put
the
stem
of
the
pipe
into
my
mouth
and
milk
into
the
bowl
and
draw
the
milk
through
this
was
about
the
same
as
sucking
mint
julep
with
a
straw
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
being
fond
of
new
milk
i
found
it
so
much
better
than
eating
rawhide
that
i
ceased
asking
the
emigrants
i
met
for
either
a
cup
or
bread
i
made
the
trip
through
in
less
than
four
days
probably
felt
a
little
calfish
but
never
lost
my
flesh
or
strength
while
at
devil
gate
on
this
trip
some
parties
arrived
from
the
states
bringing
news
of
the
army
being
ordered
to
utah
and
that
the
mail
contract
which
had
been
let
to
brigham
young
and
company
was
cancelled
and
that
in
consequence
of
this

young
express
companies
were
all
called
home
this
was
startling
news
as
all
had
been
at
peace
and
nothing
to
justify
the
move
could
be
surmised
the
cause
of
this
whole
raid
and
the
result
are
matters
of
history
so
i
will
not
mention
the
subject
at
present
after
getting
my
stuff
together
two
of
the
brethren
who
had
stayed
there
during
the
winter
accompanied
me
and
we
started
back
towards
south
pass
making
the
trip
in
good
time
my
partner
roberts
having
traded
to
good
advantage
we
were
soon
ready
to
start
home
on
arriving
in
salt
lake
city
i
went
to
the
tithing
office
as
i
had
some
articles
belonging
there
i
was
informed
that
brother
brigham
wished
to
see
me
i
went
at
once
to
his
office
not
even
taking
time
to
wash
my
face
as
i
got
to
the
outside
door
of
brother
young
office
i
met
him
coming
out
alone
after
shaking
hands
inquiring
after
my
health
he
said
come
let
us
take
a
little
walk
i
want
to
talk
to
you
we
started
and
went
toward
his
barn
in
the
rear
of
his
dwelling
he
informed
me
that
there
had
been
a
formal
complaint
made
against
me
for
robbing
the
people
of
their
goods
while
at
devil
gate
said
these
complaints
were
made
by
some
of
the
elders
in
behalf
of
themselves
and
others
he
gave
the
names
of
some
of
my
accusers
he
then
asked
are
you
willing
to
meet
these
accusations
and
answer
them
i
replied
yes
sir
i
am
both
willing
and
glad
of
the
opportunity
at
the
same
time
i
gave
the
names
of
some
i
wished
as
witnesses
he
then
said
be
here
in
ten
days
from
today
and
we
will
hear
these
complaints
i
felt
quite
sore
and
would
like
to
have
had
a
little
consolation
from
brother
brigham
but
he
commenced
moving
about
showing
me
his
horses
and
cattle
and
chatting
till
we
returned
to
his
office
his
manner
was
kind
and
pleasant
he
asked
me
about
my
trip
and
success
also
made
some
remarks
about
the
army
saying
that
we
would
have
a
busy
time
soon
said
the
boys
were
going
out
to
meet
the
army
and
see
about
getting
the
road
clear
so
that
there
would
be
no
obstructions
in
the
way
until
they
got
near
enough
to
us
that
we
could
see
what
was
best
to
do
with
them
without
having
to
go
too
far
that
he
had
sent
word
to
have
everything
belonging
to
the
mail
company
on
the
road
all
goods
and
everything
mormon
started
west
as
soon
as
possible
it
was
harvest
time
when
i
got
home
to
provo
i
felt
almost
sick
i
had
never
taken
to
the
amount
of
a
cent
anything
except
such
as
we
were
compelled
to
use
and
these
were
always
kept
in
account
by
the
clerk
as
i
had
many
opportunities
to
take
goods
and
hide
them
and
no
one
be
the
wiser
and
as
goods
had
been
misplaced
people
were
not
entirely
to
blame
for
accusing
me
after
the
stories
had
once
got
in
circulation
the
originators
of
these
accusations
were
the
more
responsible
parties
many
of
the
stories
originated
with
the
man
who
left
his
keys
with
me
to
please
his
family
and
other
relatives
he
had
collected
for
presents
considerable
stuff
while
on
his
mission
some
of
these
things
he
had
given
away
to
the
brethren
as
heretofore
mentioned
i
believe
he
left
his
trunks
and
keys
with
me
in
perfect
good
faith
at
the
time
after
getting
home
he
naturally
supposed
we
would
use
much
of
his
stuff
and
that
this
would
justify
him
in
accounting
not
only
for
what
he
had
given
away
but
for
all
that
his
would
have
caused
him
to
do
for
his
family
so
there
was
nothing
mentioned
scarcely
but
what
he
was
fetching
them
provided
it
was
not
taken
from
his
trunks
when
his
goods
arrived
and
many
of
these
fine
things
were
missing
one
bill
of
fifty
pairs
of
silk
stockings
among
the
rest
of
course
jones
stole
them
i
carried
his
keys
all
winter
in
my
pocket
entrusting
them
to
no
one
so
of
course
i
knew
whether
anything
was
stolen
or
not
it
was
this
same
man
wife
that
came
to
search
for
stolen
goods
during
the
winter
there
was
so
much
rascality
brought
to
light
that
winter
that
it
was
no
wonder
that
nearly
everyone
except
my
wife
and
family
thought
i
was
guilty
the
emigrants
taking
their
cue
from
this
brother
passed
my
name
far
and
wide
as
a
great
robber
so
much
so
that
i
was
refused
admittance
into
a
quorum
of
seventies
at
provo
that
i
had
formerly
been
invited
to
join
i
returned
home
and
worked
a
few
days
in
the
harvest
field
i
said
but
little
to
anyone
about
my
coming
trial
i
was
tempted
at
times
to
leave
the
country
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
no
friends
the
devil
tempted
me
continually
to
believe
that
president
young
would
believe
my
accusers
they
being
men
of
influence
then
there
was
another
spirit
whispering
to
me
saying
you
are
innocent
he
is
a
prophet
and
will
understand
the
truth
this
spirit
prevailed
on
arriving
at
president
young
office
august
i
found
quite
a
number
present
i
was
asked
if
i
was
ready
for
the
hearing
i
replied
that
i
did
not
see
my
witnesses
president
young
answered
when
we
need
them
we
will
send
for
them
i
was
then
called
upon
to
give
my
report
and
show
how
we
had
lived
what
the
cost
of
living
was
etc
i
had
an
account
of
all
our
expenditures
which
amounted
to
about
cts
a
week
for
each
man
some
one
remarked
that
we
could
not
live
so
cheaply
then
began
quite
a
discussion
over
our
cheap
living
some
were
inclined
to
question
my
statement
brother
young
said
to
me
brother
jones
get
up
and
tell
the
brethren
just
how
you
lived
and
explain
to
them
why
your
accounts
only
amount
to
cts
a
week
i
then
made
the
statement
that
we
had
killed
and
eaten
forty
head
of
cattle
that
were
so
poor
they
were
dying
we
had
lived
on
the
meat
and
hides
some
two
months
that
we
had
not
credited
the
owners
anything
for
them
as
we
thought
it
was
worth
the
cattle
to
eat
them
that
we
had
killed
some
game
at
various
times
that
was
ours
no
credit
allowed
had
lived
two
weeks
on
thistles
dug
from
the
frozen
ground
no
credit
one
week
on
native
garlic
three
days
on
minnows
caught
with
a
fish
too
small
to
clean
rather
bitter
in
taste
no
credit
several
meals
on
prickly
pear
leaves
roasted
no
credit
several
days
without
anything
much
but
water
to
drink
no
credit
some
five
months
mostly
on
short
rations
without
bread
or
salt
these
were
about
all
the
reasons
for
the
price
being
so
low
the
cents
per
week
covered
all
the
meats
bought
of
indians
or
anyone
else
all
groceries
soap
candles
in
fact
everything
used
belonging
to
the
companies
including
some
leather
owned
by
richards
who
remarked
to
me
that
he
was
glad
it
was
there
for
us
to
use
brothers
jas
ferguson
and
dunbar
also
made
the
same
remark
about
some
groceries
used
of
theirs
not
so
with
some
others
they
grieved
very
much
over
what
stuff
had
been
used
of
theirs
after
i
got
through
making
my
statements
brother
young
asked
each
of
my
accusers
what
they
had
to
say
no
one
answered
then
he
spoke
each
man
name
asking
them
one
at
a
time
if
they
believed
what
i
had
said
all
replied
in
the
affirmative
he
asked
each
one
if
they
believed
i
had
been
honest
and
taken
good
care
of
their
goods
all
answered
yes
brother
young
then
stood
up
and
said
to
the
brethren
you
have
accused
bro
jones
of
stealing
from
you
and
others
whom
you
represent
some
five
thousand
dollars
worth
of
goods
these
accusations
commenced
in
the
winter
when
brother
jones
and
companions
were
eating
raw
hide
and
poor
meat
suffering
every
privation
possible
to
take
care
of
your
stuff
how
such
stories
started
when
there
was
no
communication
can
only
be
accounted
for
by
the
known
power
of
satan
to
deceive
and
lie
these
accusations
continued
until
i
hearing
of
them
wrote
a
letter
to
the
bishops
and
presidents
expressing
my
confidence
in
brother
jones
labors
knowing
at
that
time
as
well
as
i
do
now
that
he
was
innocent
i
knew
what
brother
jones
feelings
were
the
other
day
when
i
notified
him
of
this
trial
turning
to
me
he
said
you
wanted
to
ask
me
if
i
thought
you
guilty
but
i
gave
you
no
chance
to
ask
the
question
i
wanted
you
to
learn
that
when
i
decide
anything
as
i
had
in
your
case
i
do
not
change
my
mind
you
were
not
brought
here
for
trial
for
being
guilty
but
to
give
you
a
chance
to
stop
these
accusations
then
turning
to
my
accusers
again
how
does
this
look
after
charging
brother
jones
as
you
have
he
makes
a
simple
statement
affirming
nothing
neither
witnessing
anything
and
each
of
you
say
you
believe
he
has
told
the
truth
you
have
nothing
to
answer
save
that
he
is
an
honest
man
well
now
what
have
you
brought
him
here
for
one
of
the
complainers
then
asked
if
some
of
the
company
with
me
might
not
have
stolen
the
goods
i
answered
no
i
am
here
to
answer
for
all
besides
it
would
have
been
almost
impossible
for
anyone
besides
myself
to
have
taken
anything
unbeknown
to
others
bro
asked
if
neither
bro
jones
nor
the
brethren
with
him
have
taken
anything
how
is
it
that
i
have
lost
so
much
brother
brigham
replied
it
is
because
you
lie
you
have
not
lost
as
you
say
you
have
this
i
knew
to
be
correct
as
before
stated
i
had
this
brother
keys
and
knew
that
nothing
had
been
taken
brother
brigham
continued
talking
chastising
some
of
the
elders
present
for
their
ingratitude
brother
kimball
also
felt
indignant
toward
them
finally
brother
brigham
commenced
to
pronounce
a
curse
upon
those
who
had
spoken
falsely
about
me
i
asked
him
to
stop
before
he
had
finished
the
words
and
told
him
i
could
bear
their
accusations
better
than
they
could
bear
his
curse
he
then
blessed
me
saying
they
would
be
cursed
if
they
did
not
cease
their
talk
saying
that
we
had
seen
the
hardest
time
that
any
elders
ever
had
while
the
mormon
battalion
suffered
they
were
free
to
travel
looking
forward
with
hope
to
something
better
but
that
we
were
much
longer
under
suffering
conditions
as
we
were
tied
up
and
had
no
hope
only
to
stay
and
take
our
chances
when
done
speaking
he
asked
me
what
would
satisfy
me
and
what
demands
i
had
to
make
i
told
him
of
the
refusal
to
admit
me
into
the
quorum
at
provo
saying
that
if
i
was
considered
worthy
i
would
like
a
recommend
so
as
to
have
fellowship
there
the
following
letter
was
given
me
great
salt
lake
city
presidents
office
this
is
to
certify
to
all
whom
it
may
concern
that
we
the
undersigned
have
investigated
the
matters
between
daniel
jones
and
the
brethren
who
stayed
with
him
at
devil
gate
last
winter
and
those
who
left
goods
at
that
place
and
we
are
satisfied
that
brother
jones
and
those
with
him
did
the
best
they
possibly
could
were
perfectly
honest
and
that
brother
jones
has
satisfactorily
accounted
for
all
the
things
which
were
taken
and
they
were
necessarily
taken
to
save
the
lives
of
himself
and
company
we
consider
that
brother
jones
is
entitled
to
the
praise
confidence
and
respect
of
all
good
men
for
the
wise
and
efficient
course
he
pursued
and
we
recommend
him
to
all
as
a
faithful
brother
in
good
standing
and
full
fellowship
in
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints

clerk
brother
brigham
said
if
we
had
set
fire
to
the
whole
outfit
and
run
off
by
the
light
of
it
he
would
never
have
found
fault
so
the
trial
ended
and
i
went
home
feeling
pretty
well
i
was
asked
many
years
after
this
trial
by
a
of
one
of
my
accusers
if
brother
brigham
did
not
favor
me
in
the
trial
because
we
had
been
partial
and
used
others
goods
leaving
brother
alone
i
replied
no
sir
brother
brigham
had
no
goods
whatever
at
gate
neither
had
his
name
ever
showed
on
box
or
bale
therefore
he
could
not
have
favored
us
on
that
account
he
decided
as
he
did
simply
because
he
was
just
and
right
whether
we
were
all
naturally
honest
or
not
we
were
honest
this
trip
at
least
for
there
was
hardly
a
day
but
what
starvation
stared
us
in
the
face
and
we
were
not
much
inclined
to
pilfer
dry
goods
anyway
i
presented
my
recommend
to
the
quorum
which
now
received
me
into
their
fellowship
after
this
some
few
came
to
me
asking
about
goods
in
rather
an
accusing
manner
i
referred
them
to
brother
brigham
so
far
and
wide
had
the
stories
gone
that
many
took
advantage
of
them
one
old
lady
an
emigrant
who
went
to
live
in
provo
played
a
sharp
game
but
was
found
out
she
had
three
daughters
who
were
all
married
soon
after
getting
in
these
young
ladies
as
is
usual
with
english
girls
had
a
nice
lot
of
linen
so
when
the
luggage
arrived
in
the
spring
the
old
lady
came
from
provo
for
the
family
goods
she
considering
her
daughters
provided
for
and
being
thrifty
in
her
nature
and
liking
to
appear
well
took
her
daughters
linen
and
traded
it
for
furniture
the
reader
must
know
that
in
those
days
anything
from
a
pumpkin
to
a
petticoat
was
a
legal
tender
for
some
amount
so
the
old
lady
had
no
trouble
in
making
the
exchange
she
went
back
feeling
indignant
at
jones
for
robbing
her
daughters
she
was
a
great
woman
and
never
missed
a
chance
to
tell
of
my
cruel
conduct
sometimes
shedding
tears
over
it
one
man
who
had
married
a
daughter
became
a
little
suspicious
so
he
went
to
the
city
and
visited
the
furniture
dealer
and
soon
found
the
linen
he
told
me
of
the
circumstance
and
asked
me
what
i
wished
done
as
he
considered
it
an
outrage
i
told
him
it
was
not
worth
noticing
as
there
were
so
many
similar
things
to
let
the
old
woman
and
her
daughters
settle
their
own
affairs
that
would
be
punishment
enough
i
could
tell
of
many
more
but
this
will
suffice
some
of
these
stories
were
related
during
the
investigation

i
will
not
attempt
to
give
a
full
account
of
the
echo
canyon
war
but
will
give
only
sufficient
to
connect
this
history
word
reached
utah
on
the
of
july
while
the
people
were
celebrating
pioneer
day
in
big
cottonwood
canyon
that
troops
were
on
the
road
to
utah
as
soon
as
this
report
was
confirmed
and
the
intentions
of
the
invaders
fully
learned
which
were
to
place
the
territory
under
martial
law
on
the
pretext
that
the
mormons
were
in
a
state
of
rebellion
brigham
young
both
as
president
of
the
church
and
governor
of
the
territory
commenced
to
advise
and
issue
orders
to
meet
the
situation
the
settlements
san
bernardino
in
lower
california
and
carson
valley
nevada
both
thrifty
prosperous
places
were
broken
up
and
the
people
called
home
to
utah
there
was
a
determined
spirit
manifested
by
both
leaders
and
people
to
be
ready
to
meet
in
the
best
possible
way
whatever
might
come
no
fear
nor
timidity
was
shown
neither
was
there
lack
of
counsel
but
everything
that
was
required
to
be
done
was
promptly
directed
and
as
promptly
executed
a
few
companies
of
cavalry
militia
were
sent
out
to
reconnoiter
nothing
official
could
be
done
by
governor
young
on
rumor
finally
an
armed
force
not
officially
known
to
him
was
found
invading
the
territory
of
utah
as
soon
as
this
was
reported
the
governor
ordered
general
wells
to
interrupt
them
and
hinder
their
approach
and
protect
the
people
of
the
territory
from
the
invading
foe
the
question
may
be
asked
did
not
president
young
and
the
people
know
that
these
were
government
troops
president
young
and
the
people
knew
it
was
a
political
mob
governor
young
not
being
notified
officially
of
their
coming
only
knew
them
as
an
armed
enemy
entering
the
territory
he
was
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states
to
govern
under
the
laws
common
in
the
country
according
to
his
oath
of
office
he
could
do
no
less
than
try
to
protect
his
territory
governor
young
had
no
more
right
to
know
this
army
than
had
the
sentinel
on
duty
to
know
his
captain
unless
the
captain
gives
the
counter
sign
this
johnston
at
first
refused
to
give
but
as
the
sequel
shows
never
got
in
until
he
hollowed
turkey
this
force
continued
to
advance
the
troops
ordered
out
by
general
wells
did
what
they
could
to
hinder
their
progress
toward
the
valleys
the
situation
finally
became
so
serious
that
companies
were
ordered
from
davis
salt
lake
and
utah
counties
to
fortify
echo
canyon
i
went
with
the
regiment
from
utah
under
colonal
pace
and
had
charge
of
a
few
picked
riflemen
we
remained
in
echo
during
the
winter
fortifying
the
place
the
boys
on
the
plains
made
it
very
disagreeable
for
the
advancing
army
nightly
running
off
their
beef
herd
burning
their
provision
trains
and
the
grass
and
in
every
way
possible
impeding
their
progress
finally
winter
set
in
with
severity
catching
them
in
the
mountains
at
fort
bridger
where
they
were
obliged
to
stay
for
the
winter
they
were
short
of
supplies
and
had
a
hard
time
wintering
albert
sidney
johnston
was
in
command
after
this
army
was
fully
settled
in
their
quarters
part
of
the
utah
army
returned
home
leaving
only
enough
to
watch
the
moves
at
bridger
this
was
a
winter
of
business
for
the
mormon
people
there
was
no
thought
of
submission
everything
was
fully
arranged
for
the
spring
work
as
soon
as
the
weather
moderated
in
the
spring
of
the
people
commenced
to
move
from
salt
lake
city
and
more
northern
settlements
south
as
far
as
utah
county
every
house
in
salt
lake
city
was
abandoned
not
a
family
remaining
men
were
detailed
to
set
fire
to
and
burn
everything
that
could
be
burned
the
people
really
manifested
joy
in
these
moves
no
one
appeared
at
the
sacrifices
all
was
life
and
energy
what
was
known
as
the
standing
army
of
utah
was
organized
intending
to
make
guerrilla
warfare
on
our
enemies
and
hinder
their
progress
while
the
people
moved
further
and
further
south
there
had
been
good
crops
raised
previous
to
this
year
the
country
was
full
of
bread
stuff
and
fat
cattle
provisions
were
prepared
for
future
use
not
much
planting
was
done
this
season
particularly
in
the
north
a
few
troops
were
kept
in
echo
and
along
the
road
i
had
charge
of
a
company
at
lost
spring
near
the
head
of
the
canyon
in
the
latter
part
of
may
we
received
orders
to
break
up
camp
and
come
in
that
peace
had
been
made
the
part
kane
took
in
bringing
about
a
settlement
is
a
part
of
written
history
powell
of
kentucky
and
mccullough
of
texas
were
sent
to
arrange
peace
they
brought
printed
posters
declaring
the
people
all
pardoned
and
notifying
them
to
return
to
their
houses
thus
we
conquered
a
great
army
and
nation
without
bloodshed
the
whole
of
this
move
was
brought
about
by
a
charge
made
against
the
mormons
by
judge
drummond
who
had
been
appointed
from
the
state
of
illinois
he
had
left
his
wife
and
family
at
home
and
brought
here
with
him
a
fancy
lady
who
sat
beside
him
in
court
this
coming
to
the
knowledge
of
the
public
drummond
was
severely
criticized
by
the
mormon
press
at
this
he
took
offense
and
laid
his
plans
for
deep
revenge
he
locked
up
his
office
with
the
records
in
it
and
arranged
with
a
party
to
set
fire
to
and
burn
up
the
whole
he
then
left
the
city
in
a
hurry
pretending
to
be
afraid
for
his
life
went
back
to
washington
and
reported
the
mormons
in
a
state
of
rebellion
stating
that
all
the
united
states
records
were
burned
and
that
he
a
united
states
judge
had
barely
escaped
with
his
life
it
is
commonly
understood
that
secretary
floyd
and
his
party
took
this
report
kindly
it
giving
grounds
for
a
move
by
the
army
to
the
far
west
thus
weakening
the
power
of
the
federal
government
financially
and
moving
much
of
the
armament
and
military
supplies
and
giving
the
rebellion
a
better
chance
to
get
a
good
start
before
the
necessary
force
could
be
put
in
the
field
by
the
government
so
drummond
report
was
acted
upon
without
any
enquiry
whatever
being
made
to
find
out
whether
it
was
true
or
not
no
moves
back
were
made
until
the
army
had
passed
through
the
city
this
was
a
sorrowful
day
for
the
soldiers
i
afterwards
traveled
and
became
well
acquainted
with
many
of
the
commissioned
officers
as
is
common
with
the
army
officers
they
were
real
gentlemen
and
were
in
no
way
responsible
for
these
moves
many
of
them
told
me
they
shed
tears
while
passing
through
the
streets
of
salt
lake
to
see
pleasant
homes
deserted
and
everything
a
waste
that
it
could
only
be
compared
to
a
city
of
the
dead
and
that
to
think
they
were
the
instruments
used
to
cause
all
this
made
them
ashamed
of
their
calling
the
army
agreed
to
fix
their
quarters
not
less
than
forty
miles
of
salt
lake
city
this
agreement
was
kept
during
the
winter
marcy
went
through
to
new
mexico
to
buy
mules
and
such
supplies
as
could
be
obtained
sooner
than
from
the
east
quite
a
number
of
my
old
acquaintances
from
new
mexico
came
through
in
the
spring
one
lewis
simmons
of
kit
carson
came
in
charge
of
several
thousand
head
of
sheep
i
obtained
permission
of
him
to
shear
the
wool
from
as
many
as
i
wished
this
was
quite
a
privilege
as
wool
was
valuable
my
old
friends
and
acquaintances
were
much
surprised
to
find
me
in
utah
and
a
mormon
but
they
all
treated
me
kindly
and
as
often
as
i
have
met
them
do
so
to
this
day
not
many
are
now
alive
i
went
to
new
mexico
when
quite
young
and
most
of
my
early
acquaintances
were
older
than
myself
few
of
them
but
lived
differently
to
what
i
have
so
at
the
present
day
i
am
almost
the
only
one
living
of
the
pioneers
of
new
mexico
while
the
standing
army
formerly
spoken
of
was
fitting
up
i
commenced
working
at
the
saddler
trade
this
i
had
partly
learned
in
louis
before
going
to
mexico
had
worked
in
the
city
of
chihuahua
learning
something
of
the
mexican
style
of
work
sortie
of
my
friends
from
santa
fe
wanted
saddles
of
my
make
as
they
had
seen
some
good
work
of
mine
in
mexico
i
made
and
sold
quite
a
number
of
saddles
to
them
i
now
commenced
to
make
this
my
business
and
as
dan
jones
the
saddler
is
well
known
i
will
let
this
answer
on
that
subject
the
coming
of
johnston
army
has
generally
been
considered
a
affair
to
this
community
to
me
it
has
always
been
a
question
for
it
cost
a
great
deal
to
bring
them
however
we
made
the
most
we
could
of
a
bad
bargain
and
got
what
we
could
out
of
the
forced
speculation
there
is
one
circumstance
connected
with
my
experience
while
in
echo
canyon
service
which
i
wish
to
put
on
record
the
killing
of
yates
by
bill
hickman
this
yates
was
a
personal
friend
of
mine
a
kindhearted
liberal
man
of
whom
i
had
received
many
kindnesses
and
his
being
murdered
did
not
agree
with
my
feelings
but
i
knew
of
no
way
to
mend
the
matter
for
i
knew
nothing
of
the
killing
till
he
was
buried
i
was
camped
with
a
small
party
about
four
miles
west
of
the
weber
valley
and
ten
or
twelve
miles
from
echo
one
very
cold
morning
about
sunrise
hickman
and
two
others
came
to
my
camp
they
seemed
almost
frozen
shaking
and
trembling
in
an
unusual
manner
hickman
asked
me
if
i
had
any
whisky
i
told
him
i
had
not
he
then
asked
if
we
had
coffee
i
replied
that
we
had
then
make
us
a
good
strong
cup
while
the
coffee
was
being
made
he
took
me
outside
and
asked
me
if
i
knew
yates
i
told
him
i
did
well
we
have
just
buried
him
he
then
told
about
yates
being
taken
prisoner
for
tampering
with
indians
and
after
talking
quite
excitedly
he
said
we
have
got
away
with
him
what
do
you
think
the
old
boss
meaning
brigham
will
say
now
if
yates
had
been
killed
as
hickman
related
in
his
book
he
would
not
have
manifested
so
much
interest
in
what
president
young
would
say
he
tried
hard
to
draw
an
approval
from
me
of
what
he
had
done
i
told
him
i
knew
nothing
about
such
modes
and
did
not
know
what
brother
young
would
say
about
it
hickman
killed
yates
for
his
money
and
horse
the
same
as
any
other
thief
and
murderer
would
have
done
and
then
excused
himself
by
telling
that
he
was
counseled
to
do
these
things
i
know
positively
that
governor
young
orders
were
to
avoid
bloodshed
in
every
way
possible
i
was
continually
acting
and
around
in
places
and
under
circumstances
that
gave
me
the
best
of
opportunities
to
know
during
the
time
that
johnston
army
was
at
bridger
there
was
an
effort
made
to
turn
the
indians
against
the
mormons
this
partially
succeeded
but
did
not
last
long
as
they
soon
got
tired
of
the
treatment
received
from
their
new
friends
while
in
camp
near
the
head
of
echo
canyon
in
may
a
number
of
weber
and
goshutes
came
and
camped
on
yellow
creek
not
far
from
our
location
a
few
of
us
visited
them
they
expressed
a
desire
to
be
peaceable
with
the
mormons
a
meeting
was
appointed
they
agreeing
to
come
to
our
camp
and
talk
over
affairs
and
make
satisfaction
for
some
things
they
admitted
having
done
at
this
conference
a
miner
presided
abram
conover
and
myself
acting
as
interpreters
i
do
not
remember
all
that
was
said
at
the
time
the
indians
acknowledged
having
committed
various
thefts
at
the
same
time
giving
their
reasons
for
having
done
so
chapter
xxii
the
troops
ordered
from
camp
floyd
to
new
mexico
i
am
solicited
to
act
as
guide
through
the
killing
of
an
ox
i
am
charged
with
being
a
traitor
to
the
church
the
trial
my
acquittal
i
desire
to
return
home
but
am
forced
to
continue
as
guide
early
in
the
spring
of
orders
came
from
washington
for
a
portion
of
the
troops
at
camp
floyd
to
move
to
new
mexico
and
to
explore
a
wagon
road
from
salt
lake
to
santa
fe
naming
the
route
as
selected
by
the
map
down
little
white
river
now
price
creek
and
crossing
over
the
mouth
of
the
dolores
thence
on
to
santa
fe
on
the
old
maps
these
rivers
showed
very
well
as
far
as
directions
went
at
this
time
i
was
the
only
person
in
utah
that
knew
anything
of
the
country
desired
to
be
explored
and
my
knowledge
was
limited
to
the
old
spanish
trail
and
some
few
side
trails
to
indian
camps
the
offer
was
made
me
to
act
as
guide
for
the
expedition
i
declined
at
first
but
finally
consented
to
go
as
far
as
green
river
with
an
exploring
party
under
lieut
archer
and
see
if
a
wagon
road
could
be
found
by
way
of
spanish
fork
to
green
river
we
succeeded
in
locating
a
road
but
not
down
price
river
we
left
that
river
to
the
right
crossing
the
plains
and
striking
the
river
at
the
lower
crossing
it
was
decided
to
put
a
working
force
of
soldiers
on
the
route
this
was
the
first
opening
of
spanish
fork
canyon
i
agreed
to
go
as
far
as
green
river
with
this
company
with
the
privilege
given
as
an
inducement
to
get
me
to
go
of
taking
along
a
trader
wagon
under
the
protection
of
the
command
i
arranged
with
my
moore
to
go
with
me
and
take
this
wagon
and
attend
to
the
trading
business
we
being
equal
partners
in
the
venture
while
working
in
spanish
fork
making
road
an
ox
was
killed
by
a
soldier
the
ox
belonged
to
a
settler
in
spanish
fork
moore
saw
the
soldier
shoot
the
ox
and
told
me
about
it
next
day
john
berry
came
into
camp
he
being
president
of
the
settlement
and
in
a
very
excited
manner
demanded
satisfaction
for
the
ox
the
commander
captain
selden
said
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
killing
and
asked
me
if
i
had
heard
anything
i
told
him
that
i
knew
who
had
killed
the
ox
berry
wanted
the
man
brought
forward
at
once
the
captain
told
him
that
the
man
should
be
given
up
to
the
civil
authorities
at
once
and
proper
restitution
made
berry
seemed
to
get
worse
and
worse
said
he
did
not
want
any
thief
to
take
back
with
him
but
wanted
to
see
him
and
have
him
punished
captain
selden
told
him
that
the
army
regulations
defined
modes
for
even
bad
men
that
everything
had
to
be
done
properly
he
advised
president
berry
to
take
a
course
to
have
the
man
either
arrested
or
else
to
leave
the
matter
to
him
and
he
would
work
the
punishment
so
as
to
get
the
pay
and
send
to
the
owner
berry
would
not
listen
to
any
proposition
whatever
finally
i
told
him
that
he
was
unreasonable
and
that
i
would
not
point
out
the
man
to
him
but
would
to
the
captain
before
that
i
would
bring
the
money
with
me
on
my
return
and
that
i
would
leave
it
to
bishop
miller
the
presiding
bishop
of
utah
county
whether
i
was
right
or
not
on
my
return
i
offered
to
pay
to
berry
the
amount
he
would
not
accept
it
unless
accompanied
by
a
plea
of
guilt
to
a
charge
already
preferred
against
me
before
the
high
council
of
being
a
traitor
to
the
church
aiding
and
abetting
an
enemy
to
destroy
property
belonging
to
a
brother
and
refusing
to
point
out
the
guilty
party
when
called
on
to
do
so
taking
the
whole
charge
together
it
was
too
steep
for
me
that
i
had
refused
to
point
out
the
party
was
a
fact
and
i
was
willing
to
be
judged
on
the
merits
of
the
refusal
when
all
the
reasons
were
stated
so
i
refused
and
was
brought
to
trial
the
charge
was
read
and
considerable
testimony
given
in
the
charge
the
price
of
the
ox
was
demanded
no
effort
was
made
to
oppose
this
but
it
was
acknowledged
and
offered
to
be
settled
at
length
bishop
miller
the
president
stood
up
and
motioned
that
the
charge
be
sustained
this
aroused
me
i
replied
to
the
bishop
motion
in
an
excited
and
insulting
manner
so
much
so
that
he
motioned
that
daniel
jones
be
cut
off
from
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
for
insulting
the
priesthood
i
replied
you
hold
on
you
can
not
do
it
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
i
mean
i
have
had
my
say
i
am
done
now
you
have
yours
and
whatever
you
require
of
me
i
will
do
but
i
will
not
be
cut
off
from
the
church
even
if
i
have
to
acknowledge
to
the
charge
here

clark
asked
permission
to
speak
he
said
he
did
not
think
the
charge
was
sustained
by
the
evidence
some
others
spoke
the
same
finally
bishop
miller
said
to
the
clerk
read
the
charge
again
on
hearing
it
read
the
second
time
he
said
oh
i
do
not
mean
to
sustain
the
charge
that
brother
jones
is
a
traitor
or
anything
of
the
kind
i
had
paid
no
particular
attention
to
that
part
all
i
mean
is
that
brother
jones
pay
for
the
ox
according
to
agreement
this
was
a
close
call
for
me
but
i
saved
my
standing
and
honor
if
i
had
said
nothing
probably
this
whole
charge
would
have
went
on
record
as
it
was
inasmuch
as
i
had
offered
to
pay
the
amount
sent
by
the
captain
the
whole
charge
was
thrown
out
this
command
under
selden
was
about
one
month
working
a
road
through
to
green
river
we
had
a
pleasant
time
doing
well
with
our
trading
we
were
treated
well
by
both
officers
and
men
captain
selden
was
a
officer
without
any
prejudices
against
the
mormons
although
he
was
of
one
those
ordered
out
to
wage
a
war
against
the
people
on
arriving
at
green
river
where
another
guide
was
to
take
my
place
we
found
he
was
not
there
as
the
man
a
mexican
had
not
arrived
i
was
told
that
my
services
would
be
required
the
balance
of
the
trip
i
refused
to
go
before
leaving
utah
i
had
received
word
from
brother
brigham
that
he
did
not
wish
me
to
go
on
this
trip
george
bean
told
me
that
brother
young
had
said
tell
brother
jones
i
consider
him
one
of
my
good
boys
and
i
do
not
want
him
to
go
off
into
that
dangerous
country
and
risk
his
life
for
money
i
knew
this
to
be
the
best
of
counsel
for
the
country
was
dangerous
the
mexicans
of
new
mexico
were
not
over
their
bad
feelings
about
the
indian
slave
trade
the
ones
who
had
profited
by
this
traffic
still
held
a
grudge
against
mormons
this
i
had
learned
from
some
of
my
old
associates
that
came
through
with
colonel
marcy
both
utes
and
navajoes
were
uncertain
in
those
days
particularly
those
living
on
the
borders
of
new
mexico
there
were
no
regular
mails
or
communications
in
those
days
between
the
two
countries
not
only
having
a
desire
to
respect
the
kindly
advice
of
brother
brigham
but
knowing
the
risk
we
would
run
i
declined
to
go
farther
on
refusing
colonel
canby
who
was
in
command
instructed
his
adjutant
to
tell
me
that
the
good
of
the
service
required
me
to
go
on
as
guide
and
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
them
to
fill
the
orders
from
washington
without
my
services
that
if
i
went
willingly
i
should
be
well
treated
and
respected
and
that
my
would
be
employed
as
assistant
guide
that
they
needed
our
wagon
and
team
and
that
the
quartermaster
would
pay
us
for
it
i
still
refused
telling
them
i
would
run
too
much
risk
in
getting
back
to
utah
colonel
canby
then
promised
me
protection
and
mileage
home
and
informed
me
that
i
could
accept
the
terms
willingly
or
otherwise
they
would
have
to
keep
a
guard
over
me
to
see
that
i
did
not
leave
neither
would
they
settle
with
me
for
services
up
to
date
i
have
several
affidavits
proving
these
facts
we
found
that
nothing
would
do
but
to
consent
the
main
command
under
canby
intended
to
follow
what
was
known
as
lorin
trail
up
the
grand
river
cross
over
and
go
down
to
fort
garland
while
a
company
under
lieutenant
stith
was
to
explore
the
dolores
river
i
was
wanted
for
both
but
as
this
could
not
be
i
was
sent
on
the
lorin
trail
accompanied
by
a
sergeant
and
an
indian
to
the
junction
of
the
grand
and
gunnison
rivers
to
find
the
road
and
see
how
the
crossing
was
my
hopes
were
that
after
this
trip
and
finding
the
road
all
right
to
this
point
that
i
could
get
off
and
return
home
but
not
so
it
was
decided
that
we
had
to
go
on
and
guide
the
exploring
expedition
through
on
the
dolores
i
told
canby
i
did
not
know
the
country
no
difference
my
natural
ability
with
my
general
knowledge
of
the
country
was
all
sufficient
so
at
length
i
gave
up
and
went
willingly
the
most
of
the
officers
treated
me
with
great
kindness
and
respect
they
knew
i
was
a
member
of
the
mormon
church
and
often
asked
me
questions
about
our
religion
many
evenings
were
spent
in
chatting
about
utah
affairs
in
a
very
pleasant
and
agreeable
manner
after
crossing
green
river
there
is
a
desert
of
miles
to
grand
river
the
troops
suffered
considerable
on
this
desert
some
few
leaving
the
road
to
hunt
water
got
lost
and
one
or
two
never
were
found
they
either
perished
or
fell
into
the
hands
of
some
hostile
indians
one
little
circumstance
showing
the
need
of
understanding
something
of
their
language
or
signs
in
dealing
with
indians
happened
at
green
river
there
were
quite
a
number
of
utes
camped
below
the
crossing
these
indians
came
into
camp
quite
often
one
day
i
noticed
a
crowd
of
soldiers
making
some
curious
and
exciting
moves
i
approached
to
see
what
was
the
matter
i
saw
an
indian
standing
holding
something
in
his
hand
and
looking
rather
confused
the
soldiers
were
getting
a
rope
ready
to
hang
him
all
was
excitement
and
i
am
satisfied
that
if
i
had
not
happened
along
the
poor
indian
would
have
been
swinging
by
the
neck
in
less
than
five
minutes
i
could
see
from
the
indian
manner
that
he
realized
something
was
wrong
but
could
not
understand
why
he
was
surrounded
by
soldiers
i
asked
them
what
they
were
doing
they
said
that
the
indian
had
brought
one
of
their
horses
that
he
had
stolen
into
camp
and
sold
it
for
thirty
dollars
that
the
owner
of
the
horse
was
there
and
they
were
intending
to
hang
the
d
thief
i
told
them
to
hold
on
a
minute
that
i
did
not
think
an
indian
would
steal
a
horse
and
bring
it
into
the
camp
where
it
belonged
to
sell
some
one
answered
yes
he
has
there
is
the
money
now
in
his
hand
that
he
got
for
the
horse
the
indian
was
still
standing
there
holding
the
money
in
his
open
hand
and
looking
about
as
foolish
as
ever
i
saw
one
of
his
race
look
i
asked
him
what
was
up
he
said
he
did
not
know
what
was
the
matter
what
about
the
horse
and
money
he
answered
i
found
a
horse
down
at
our
camp
i
knew
it
belonged
to
the
soldiers
so
i
brought
it
up
thinking
they
would
give
me
something
for
bringing
it
this
man
pointing
to
one
came
and
took
hold
of
the
horse
and
put
some
money
in
my
hand
it
was
yellow
money
and
i
did
not
want
it
he
then
put
some
silver
in
my
hand
there
it
all
is
i
understand
what
they
are
mad
about
i
soon
got
the
trouble
explained
the
man
thought
he
was
buying
the
horse
the
indian
thought
he
was
rewarding
him
for
bringing
the
animal
to
camp
the
owner
happened
along
just
as
the
trade
was
being
made
here
ignorance
and
prejudice
came
near
causing
a
great
crime
as
soon
as
this
was
explained
i
took
the
money
and
gave
it
back
to
the
owner
no
one
had
thought
of
taking
the
money
all
were
bent
on
hanging
the
honest
fellow
soon
there
was
a
reverse
of
feeling
most
of
the
soldiers
in
the
crowd
being
irish
they
let
their
impulses
run
as
far
the
other
way
loading
the
indian
with
shirts
and
blouses
some
gave
him
money
so
that
he
went
away
feeling
pretty
well
but
he
remarked
that
the
soldiers
were
big
fools
i
have
often
thought
there
were
many
like
these
soldiers
in
dealing
with
indians
chapter

difficulty
in
finding
the
trail
the
character
of
our
commanding
officer
my
discharge
as
guide
a
proposition
to
kill
stith
rejected
by
moore
and
myself
arrival
at
santa
fe
the
confidence
of
the
quartermaster
in
me
on
arriving
at
grand
river
stith
outfit
was
prepared
and
we
were
set
across
the
river
in
a
place
entirely
unknown
to
me
i
did
not
even
know
whether
the
dolores
river
was
above
or
below
me
and
so
told
the
officer
there
was
a
point
known
as
the
bend
of
dolores
where
i
had
been
but
from
where
we
were
to
that
point
the
country
was
new
to
me
i
had
no
definite
idea
of
the
distance
but
knew
it
must
be
several
journey
this
country
as
the
name
of
the
river
implies
was
about
the
worst
country
i
ever
traveled
through
while
we
were
prospecting
to
see
if
we
could
get
any
sight
of
the
river
i
found
a
lone
indian
he
had
been
out
all
alone
on
a
stealing
expedition
to
the
navajo
indians
had
got
a
few
horses
and
was
on
his
way
home
to
uintah
after
much
persuasion
and
some
pay
i
induced
him
to
go
a
day
travel
and
show
me
the
river
and
put
me
on
the
trail
if
there
was
any
we
were
about
thirty
miles
above
the
dolores
where
it
empties
into
grand
river
on
arriving
at
the
river
we
found
a
trail
leading
up
it
for
only
a
short
distance
my
indian
friend
described
the
country
and
trails
to
me
so
that
i
felt
pretty
sure
of
getting
to
a
place
with
which
i
was
acquainted
we
were
ten
days
reaching
the
bend
of
the
dolores
where
the
old
spanish
trail
strikes
it
but
does
not
cross
we
only
struck
the
river
twice
the
whole
distance
it
runs
through
box
canyons
most
of
the
way
and
is
unapproachable
so
the
ordered
explored
i
do
not
think
will
be
made
yet
awhile
by
this
time
we
had
learned
the
character
of
our
commanding
officer
he
was
simply
a
ruffian
of
the
worst
type
i
had
to
watch
him
daily
as
he
was
suspicious
of
being
led
into
ambush
we
had
met
one
party
of
indians
an
old
man
and
family
my
was
acquainted
with
him
he
having
been
one
of
the
grand
valley
company
that
was
driven
away
by
the
indians
this
old
man
was
of
the
peace
party
and
told
moore
all
about
what
had
happened
after
they
were
driven
away
seeing
moore
friendly
and
talking
with
the
old
indian
made
stith
more
suspicious
of
us
he
often
hinted
that
it
would
be
dangerous
for
us
if
we
ever
came
across
indians
in
any
number
this
was
not
very
pleasant
for
we
were
in
a
country
where
a
great
many
indians
roamed
and
we
were
liable
to
run
across
a
lot
at
any
time
but
as
good
luck
would
have
it
we
never
did
we
always
believed
that
if
we
had
run
into
an
indian
camp
that
stith
would
have
attempted
to
take
our
lives
the
soldiers
did
not
like
him
neither
did
they
think
as
he
did
but
they
all
feared
him
as
he
had
shot
down
some
of
his
company
this
same
officer
had
shot
and
killed
one
man
who
had
given
out
and
could
not
travel
this
occurred
on
a
texas
desert
my
intention
was
to
take
care
of
myself
and
if
we
had
met
any
indians
to
see
that
i
was
not
harmed
if
a
good
rifle
could
protect
me
moore
and
myself
watched
him
all
the
time
we
arrived
at
the
dolores
bend
at
eleven
i
recommended
camping
stith
said
he
had
not
made
a
day
march
and
would
not
camp
i
said
then
let
noon
no
it
lacks
an
hour
of
noon
we
must
travel
an
hour
yet
i
told
him
i
wanted
time
to
get
my
reckoning
as
i
had
not
been
here
for
some
time
and
had
come
in
a
different
direction
from
what
i
had
done
before
and
that
there
were
many
trails
leading
from
this
point
further
north
it
was
twenty
miles
to
the
next
water
all
this
would
not
induce
him
even
to
noon
but
he
ordered
the
march
to
continue
after
going
a
few
miles
he
asked
me
where
the
water
was
for
noon
i
told
him
that
all
the
water
we
would
get
would
take
till
after
night
to
reach
he
then
notified
moore
and
myself
that
we
were
discharged
and
that
there
was
a
mexican
along
who
knew
the
road
better
than
we
did
i
told
him
allright
to
pay
us
and
we
would
turn
back
this
he
refused
to
do
saying
that
he
intended
to
keep
us
along
in
case
the
mexican
did
not
know
the
country
that
we
would
be
better
than
no
guides
we
had
guided
this
company
miles
through
a
country
entirely
unknown
to
us
in
ten
days
time
and
the
infantry
with
packs
had
never
been
lost
or
failed
to
get
good
camps
now
after
getting
for
the
first
time
on
a
good
trail
we
were
discharged
for
not
finding
water
for
noon
on
a
dry
desert
and
as
before
stated
leaving
water
at
about
eleven
so
much
for
west
point
discipline
after
discharging
us
as
he
supposed
stith
put
his
mexican
guide
to
lead
moore
and
myself
following
along
and
taking
it
easy
we
were
in
no
way
concerned
about
our
discharge
for
the
quartermaster
had
told
me
to
get
along
the
best
we
could
with
stith
but
if
we
wanted
when
we
got
into
santa
fe
to
come
back
and
meet
canby
command
and
that
we
need
not
take
a
discharge
from
stith
unless
we
so
desired
they
now
left
the
trail
at
night
taking
to
the
left
over
a
dry
mesa
but
no
water
was
found
there
was
considerable
suffering
among
the
soldiers
as
there
was
no
water
for
coffee
or
cooking
and
but
little
to
drink
here
the
company
planned
to
kill
stith
nearly
all
the
company
agreeing
they
sent
their
committee
to
moore
and
myself
with
the
proposition
that
stith
and
the
mexican
guide
be
killed
together
with
all
that
would
not
sustain
the
move
and
that
we
were
to
guide
them
out
of
the
country
this
was
fully
determined
upon
and
we
had
much
trouble
in
persuading
them
out
of
the
notion
but
finally
succeeded
next
day
we
continued
our
journey
arriving
at
the
mancos
river
much
later
than
we
would
have
done
had
we
kept
the
trail
stith
soon
learned
that
the
mexican
knew
but
little
about
the
country
after
crossing
the
river
we
struck
a
big
trail
where
it
ascended
a
hill
on
getting
on
this
trail
stith
made
some
very
insulting
remarks
saying
that
now
we
had
a
guide
who
knew
something
on
reaching
the
top
of
the
hill
they
found
that
the
trail
scattered
being
a
hunting
trail
and
not
a
route
this
puzzled
the
guide
who
was
the
one
that
had
taken
the
wrong
direction
i
here
got
my
ideas
clear
and
for
the
soldiers
sake
they
having
treated
us
kindly
i
told
stith
lieutenant
where
the
trail
was
he
informed
stith
who
was
now
willing
to
listen
having
lost
faith
in
his
mexican
we
soon
struck
the
old
trail
we
could
now
have
regained
our
positions
had
we
wished
to
but
we
agreed
with
lieut
bristol
who
was
a
real
good
fellow
to
tell
him
every
morning
when
necessary
about
the
trail
and
distance
but
not
to
speak
to
stith
about
anything
and
go
along
as
though
we
cared
nothing
about
the
road
after
this
moore
and
i
had
a
pretty
good
time
riding
along
without
any
responsibility
hunting
when
we
liked
and
taking
it
easy
we
had
many
a
good
laugh
at
stith
expense
for
if
we
started
out
of
a
morning
ahead
he
was
afraid
to
lose
sight
of
us
for
fear
his
guide
would
get
lost
one
morning
while
traveling
on
a
nice
plain
trail
up
a
wide
smooth
flat
moore
and
i
started
up
a
steep
mountain
side
intending
to
follow
along
the
mountain
ridge
and
kill
some
game
we
had
gone
but
a
short
distance
without
any
trail
whatever
when
on
looking
back
we
saw
the
mexican
guide
and
stith
had
left
the
trail
and
started
to
follow
us
bristol
was
in
the
rear
with
the
pack
train
at
first
we
felt
like
letting
them
follow
but
it
seemed
too
hard
on
the
poor
foot
soldiers
to
play
them
such
a
trick
so
steve
moore
turned
round
and
called
out
what
in
the
h
are
you
following
us
for
stith
wanted
to
know
if
we
were
not
on
the
trail
moore
told
him
his
guide
ought
to
know
where
the
trail
was
that
it
was
down
on
the
flat
to
go
back
and
not
be
following
us
up
the
mountain
we
traveled
along
the
mountain
ridge
in
sight
of
the
trail
most
of
the
day
watching
the
company
they
often
seemed
lost
and
would
stop
and
look
to
see
if
they
could
see
us
we
finally
came
into
the
trail
and
traveled
along
with
the
command
on
arriving
at
the
first
settlement
stith
got
drunk
and
gambled
off
a
lot
of
money
that
he
expected
to
cover
by
the
vouchers
i
would
sign
before
drawing
any
pay
from
him
we
were
seventy
miles
from
santa
fe
the
headquarters
where
we
were
to
report
to
colonel
fontleroy
the
commander
stith
continued
his
spree
several
days
so
moore
and
i
saddled
up
and
went
on
to
santa
fe
alone
on
reaching
that
place
i
found
many
old
friends
among
the
rest
manuel
woods
keeping
hotel
he
was
an
old
hotel
keeper
for
whom
i
had
kept
bar
during
my
first
stay
in
santa
fe
i
explained
our
situation
to
him
stating
that
we
intended
to
wait
till
the
main
command
came
in
he
told
us
to
make
his
house
our
home
as
long
as
we
desired
and
we
could
have
all
the
money
we
wanted
besides
my
old
friends
john
phillips
stephens
redmond
and
many
others
expressed
themselves
ready
to
assist
us
in
any
way
possible
we
turned
our
mules
into
the
government
corral
and
went
to
stop
at
the
hotel
colonel
fontleroy
on
hearing
that
some
one
had
arrived
from
utah
sent
for
us
to
come
to
his
office
the
next
day
there
had
been
some
uneasiness
felt
about
the
company
we
had
traveled
with
and
a
party
had
been
sent
out
to
meet
them
the
party
had
gone
as
far
as
the
dolores
and
returned
we
had
seen
their
tracks
i
wanted
to
follow
their
trail
knowing
it
to
be
white
men
tracks
stith
took
them
for
indians
and
refused
to
follow
me
on
meeting
the
colonel
he
in
a
very
pompous
manner
asked
me
who
i
was
i
replied
daniel
w
jones
where
are
you
from
salt
lake
city
utah
how
did
you
come
here
on
a
mule
what
is
your
business
in
what
capacity
have
you
come
he
was
now
much
excited
and
asked
a
series
of
questions
before
stopping
i
then
told
him
i
was
a
guide
in
government
employ
he
asked
where
are
the
troops
where
is
the
command
you
are
guiding
the
last
i
saw
of
them
they
were
about
seventy
miles
back
the
commander
and
most
of
the
company
drunk
why
are
you
not
with
them
i
do
like
whisky
was
my
answer
i
felt
insulted
by
his
manner
in
first
speaking
so
abruptly
to
me
and
was
determined
not
to
give
him
any
satisfaction
until
he
spoke
to
me
in
a
respectable
manner
this
he
seemed
to
see
and
commenced
asking
his
questions
more
politely
i
gave
him
all
the
information
i
could
about
the
moves
of
the
troops
on
the
road
he
now
approved
of
my
coming
ahead
when
stith
arrived
he
made
out
my
account
and
asked
me
to
sign
the
vouchers
i
thanked
him
telling
him
that
i
did
not
need
any
money
and
did
not
wish
my
discharge
just
then
he
flew
into
a
terrible
passion
saying
that
he
could
not
settle
his
accounts
unless
i
signed
the
vouchers
i
replied
that
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
settling
his
accounts
all
i
wanted
was
my
transfer
back
to
the
command
this
he
refused
me
so
we
went
and
bought
two
mules
on
credit
and
went
back
to
the
command
we
met
them
at
taos
the
quartermaster
was
glad
to
see
us
as
he
needed
our
services
i
took
the
position
of
both
guide
and
interpreter
moore
continuing
as
assistant
we
got
into
the
farming
district
about
harvest
time
there
was
no
forage
to
be
had
except
fields
of
grain
these
were
bought
at
high
prices
when
animals
were
turned
in
over
night
and
a
guard
placed
around
them
often
the
animals
would
get
into
other
fields
doing
some
damage
the
mexicans
made
great
complaint
often
asking
several
hundred
dollars
for
damages
the
pasturage
generally
cost
from
to
per
night
the
quartermaster
would
generally
hand
me
and
tell
me
to
settle
sometimes
i
would
be
two
or
three
hours
settling
as
the
damage
sometimes
was
on
various
patches
the
people
were
at
times
unreasonable
in
their
demands
when
i
could
not
get
a
reasonable
settlement
would
refer
to
the
authority
i
made
the
people
understand
that
they
could
not
get
anything
only
what
was
just
and
reasonable
when
they
found
that
i
understood
them
they
became
much
easier
to
deal
with
in
that
country
what
you
do
today
always
gets
to
the
next
camping
place
before
you
do
when
all
my
accounts
were
settled
for
the
day
i
would
hand
what
money
was
left
to
the
quartermaster
sometimes
it
would
be
over
one
day
on
handing
him
the
money
he
said
jones
you
a
d
fool
why
i
asked
that
money
is
already
accounted
for
i
did
not
take
the
hint
as
he
expected
i
would
but
continued
to
return
the
overplus
this
remark
to
me
was
made
in
kindness
as
the
quartermaster
was
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
wanted
me
to
keep
the
money
for
myself
but
i
did
not
think
it
right
it
would
never
have
done
me
any
good
when
we
arrived
in
santa
fe
we
were
paid
off
in
full
up
to
date
and
mileage
allowed
but
no
protection
was
furnished
for
our
return
home
the
navajoes
had
just
broken
out
and
the
troops
had
been
ordered
to
chastise
them
the
good
of
the
service
now
required
that
we
get
home
the
best
we
could
aside
from
this
we
were
treated
in
the
best
manner
possible
provisions
being
given
us
by
the
quartermaster
and
some
valuable
presents
by
other
officers
we
knew
that
our
chances
were
slim
forgetting
back
safely
to
make
things
as
safe
as
possible
however
we
bought
a
good
wagon
and
four
first
class
mules
loaded
up
with
mexican
and
navajo
blankets
and
other
goods
believing
that
we
would
be
less
liable
to
get
robbed
of
these
goods
than
if
we
carried
our
money
with
us
we
were
also
informed
by
some
friends
who
had
lately
come
in
from
denver
that
blankets
of
this
kind
were
in
good
demand
at
that
place
there
was
a
great
rush
for
pike
peak
and
miners
and
prospectors
wanted
these
blankets

two
young
men
that
came
through
from
utah
whose
homes
were
in
the
states
accompanied
us
on
horseback
they
were
well
mounted
and
we
were
all
well
armed
we
took
every
precaution
to
make
ourselves
secure
against
thieves
stealing
our
stock
or
taking
advantage
of
us
in
any
way
we
took
the
open
road
by

of
las
vegas
fort
union
passing
along
the
raton
mountains
and
continuing
on
without
molestation
of
any
kind
until
the
evening
of
the
when
we
were
attacked
and
robbed
the
particulars
of
which
i
shall
give
together
with
our
trip
home
to
the
best
of
my
ability
and
recollection
late
in
the
afternoon
we
arrived
at
a
creek
where
we
intended
to
camp
but
found
no
water
we
had
traveled
about
thirty
miles
and
the
next
chance
for
camping
was
several
miles
further
on
some
of
my
reflections
would
not
be
amiss
here
there
was
some
game
in
sight
we
killed
some
wild
turkeys
my
companions
were
out
after
antelope
and
i
was
alone
awaiting
their
return
we
were
now
quite
out
of
the
dangerous
country
to
all
appearances
having
traveled
over
three
hundred
miles
without
disturbance
we
were
now
where
it
was
considered
safe
for
any
one
to
travel
still
i
felt
uneasy
i
remembered
the
words
of
president
young
and
i
never
had
felt
entirely
safe
on
the
road
in
my
reflections
i
felt
as
though
i
would
rather
lose
what
i
had
made
than
be
tempted
to
disobey
counsel
again
by
being
successful
still
i
was
in
hopes
we
could
keep
our
property
and
would
try
and
do
right
in
the
future
i
asked
the
lord
to
direct
me
for
the
best
but
to
spare
our
lives
on
our
road
home
i
had
a
positive
feeling
that
we
were
in
danger
shortly
before
sundown
we
started
on
intending
to
make
a
night
drive
to
the
next
watering
place
after
traveling
a
short
distance
we
came
to
a
hollow
where
a
just
passing
over
had
deposited
some
good
fresh
water
and
where
grass
and
fuel
were
plentiful
on
approaching
camp
we
descended
from
a
ridge
some
three
hundred
yards
to
a
flat
there
was
an
open
space
some
one
hundred
yards
wide
to
the
right
of
the
road
we
drove
to
near
the
center
of
this
opening
the
brush
around
was
about
waist
high
and
not
very
thick
i
commenced
gathering
up
fuel
the
others
unhitching
and
taking
care
of
the
animals
after
getting
some
dry
brush
ready
i
was
about
striking
a
fire
when
we
heard
a
noise
of
horsemen
back
on
the
road
the
full
moon
was
shining
and
on
looking
up
we
saw
some
eight
or
ten
horsemen
just
disappearing
over
the
ridge
going
from
us
as
we
were
near
the
road
and
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
any
one
passing
this
surprised
us
not
being
able
to
account
for
the
move
moore
and
myself
took
our
guns
and
went
up
to
where
we
had
seen
them
to
reconnoiter
on
getting
to
the
summit
of
the
ridge
we
could
see
the
tracks
plainly
where
they
had
come
following
after
us
and
on
seeing
us
had
turned
suddenly
and
run
back
they
no
doubt
had
expected
us
to
continue
on
some
eight
miles
farther
to
the
creek
before
camping
and
had
run
on
us
unexpectedly
while
examining
these
tracks
and
trying
to
solve
the
mystery
we
heard
the
noise
of
horses
about
two
hundred
yards
from
the
road
and
discovered
a
small
clump
of
cedars
in
the
direction
being
on
the
same
side
of
the
road
as
our
camp
and
just
back
from
the
summit
of
the
ridge
we
decided
at
once
that
they
were
robbers
following
us
that
they
were
tying
up
and
hiding
intending
to
creep
upon
us
afoot
being
too
cowardly
to
make
an
open
attack
we
hurried
back
to
camp
intending
to
try
and
get
to
the
timber
on
the
creek
i
gave
orders
to
hitch
up
as
quickly
as
possible
the
two
horsemen
were
to
take
the
lead
and
run
where
the
road
was
good
holding
back
where
rough
i
was
to
drive
while
moore
did
the
fighting
from
the
wagon
if
we
were
followed
our
team
was
full
of
life
so
much
so
that
we
had
to
change
the
bits
on
the
leaders
putting
on
heavy
curbbits
taking
off
the
common
ones
with
checks
this
left
the
driving
reins
alone
in
the
bits
the
saddle
horses
were
soon
ready
one
man
holding
them
just
in
front
of
the
team
three
of
us
hitching
as
fast
as
possible
the
mules
commenced
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
clump
of
cedars
now
and
then
looking
along
the
edge
of
the
brush
around
us
i
remarked
that
i
believed
they
were
surrounding
us
just
as
i
was
about
taking
the
lines
in
hand
the
team
being
all
hitched
except
the
wheel
mules
traces
a
shot
was
fired
i
thought
it
came
from
one
of
our
own
party
so
near
by
it
seemed
i
asked
who
was
that
shooting
moore
answered
you
know
as
much
about
it
as
i
do
suddenly
several
shots
were
fired
at
this
the
mules
started
on
the
full
run
i
grabbed
the
nigh
leader
the
two
men
with
horses
now
had
hold
of
them
but
were
not
mounted
all
ran
together
making
a
half
circle
back
to
the
road
about
where
we
turned
out
moore
holding
to
the
off
wheeler
as
we
ran
the
shots
came
thick
and
fast
from
the
brush
clear
along
the
up
to
the
road
just
as
we
struck
the
road
crossing
it
to
the
west
our
direction
of
travel
being
to
the
north
shots
commenced
coming
from
the
left
side
one
striking
and
killing
the
nigh
wheel
mule
this
stopped
the
team
as
the
leaders
alone
could
not
pull
the
wagon
and
drag
the
dead
mule
the
shots
were
now
coming
thick
and
fast
from
all
sides
the
lead
mules
were
trying
to
get
away
i
called
to
moore
to
cut
the
breast
strap
of
the
dead
mule
so
that
the
leaders
could
continue
toward
open
ground
he
made
a
strike
or
two
with
his
knife
but
while
doing
so
the
off
wheeler
fell
dead
an
instant
after
the
off
leader
fell
i
now
had
hold
of
the
only
mule
left
standing
the
two
horsemen
were
just
in
front
of
the
team
and
when
it
stopped
they
halted
also
one
of
them
daniel
dafney
i
shall
always
remember
for
his
coolness
and
courage
i
felt
like
giving
the
word
to
run
and
abandon
the
team
but
knowing
that
we
were
some
eight
hundred
miles
from
home
did
not
much
like
the
prospect
of
footing
it
through
moore
raised
his
gun
to
shoot
i
told
him
not
to
do
so
as
they
no
doubt
would
make
a
rush
for
us
if
we
fired
in
those
days
were
all
we
had
one
of
the
horsemen
had
a
rope
knocked
from
his
hand
with
a
bullet
on
this
he
said
to
dafney
it
is
getting
too
hot
let
run
dafney
replied
i
will
not
leave
till
all
leave
just
at
this
the
off
leader
sprang
up
not
having
been
injured
much
only
grazed
across
the
loins
i
spoke
to
moore
telling
him
to
cut
the
mule
out
of
the
harness
and
i
would
do
the
same
with
the
nigh
one
and
we
would
try
to
get
away
dafney
came
and
assisted
each
of
us
in
getting
our
mules
out
of
the
harness
the
most
of
the
shots
being
directed
toward
the
team
dafney
ran
ten
times
more
risk
in
coming
to
our
assistance
than
if
he
had
remained
in
front
the
lead
mules
were
fine
large
animals
and
full
of
life
they
were
terribly
frightened
at
the
shooting
which
continued
almost
without
ceasing
once
i
called
to
them
to
stop
shooting
that
there
was
no
need
of
killing
us
as
they
were
strong
enough
to
come
and
take
what
they
wanted
this
i
spoke
in
spanish
no
reply
except
a
stronger
volley
of
shots
the
mule
i
had
hold
of
had
never
been
ridden
but
there
was
no
time
for
swapping
horses
each
of
us
had
heavy
rifles
i
got
a
little
the
start
of
moore
as
dafney
assisted
me
first
my
mule
had
a
long
rope
tied
to
his
neck
and
when
i
mounted
and
started
with
the
rope
dragging
it
tangled
in
the
harness
bringing
my
mule
to
a
sudden
halt
i
managed
to
untie
the
rope
from
his
neck
while
doing
this
dafney
succeeded
in
helping
moore
with
his
mule
which
was
almost
unmanageable
we
finally
all
got
about
an
even
start
the
balls
were
still
coming
thick
and
fast
the
robbers
having
advanced
up
as
near
as
possible
without
coming
into
open
ground
some
of
them
being
within
thirty
yards
of
us
our
road
led
to
the
north
but
was
blocked
the
firing
coming
from
every
direction
but
the
west
where
there
was
no
brush
our
animals
needed
no
guiding
as
soon
as
they
were
free
to
run
they
broke
with
full
speed
to
get
away
from
the
shots
it
would
be
hard
to
tell
which
was
the
most
frightened
we
or
the
mules
most
of
the
shooting
was
done
with
revolvers
the
mules
soon
took
the
lead
of
the
horses
the
prairie
had
many
badger
holes
and
broken
spots
and
my
mule
came
near
throwing
me
several
times
in
dodging
them
i
had
not
removed
the
mule
collar
and
when
i
could
scarcely
stick
on
for
these
side
plunges
i
ran
my
arm
under
it
taking
my
gun
in
my
hand
and
clinching
it
tight
this
steadied
me
so
that
i
felt
safe
after
running
some
distance
my
mule
commenced
to
act
as
though
he
was
wounded
and
about
to
fall
this
continued
for
several
minutes
giving
us
much
uneasiness
but
he
soon
recovered
himself
he
must
have
been
in
pain
from
excitement
as
he
was
not
wounded
moore
and
i
were
now
neck
and
neck
on
the
lead
going
at
full
speed
i
asked
him
to
turn
to
the
north
and
get
our
right
direction
of
travel
he
paid
no
attention
to
my
words
so
i
repeated
them
rather
sharply
when
he
answered
d
it
turn
to
the
north
yourself
i
can
not
turn
my
mule
any
more
than
a
we
found
we
were
much
like
the
old
parson
who
yoked
himself
to
the
calf
we
were
running
away
in
spite
of
ourselves
on
looking
back
we
saw
that
the
horsemen
were
about
twenty
yards
in
the
rear
i
called
and
asked
them
if
their
horses
were
under
control
they
answered
yes
then
ride
up
and
take
the
lead
they
answered
that
our
mules
were
too
fast
for
them
so
we
managed
to
check
their
speed
a
little
the
horsemen
whipping
up
at
length
got
the
lead
when
they
turned
to
the
north
in
the
direction
we
wished
to
travel
shortly
after
turning
to
the
north
we
came
to
a
clump
of
cedars
here
moore
and
i
tried
hard
to
persuade
our
companions
to
stop
tie
up
and
go
back
with
us
and
creep
on
to
the
robbers
believing
we
could
surprise
and
whip
them
this
we
could
not
prevail
on
them
to
do
we
continued
on
some
few
miles
coming
to
the
creek
bank
where
it
was
so
steep
that
we
could
not
cross
this
forced
us
to
go
down
toward
the
road
which
we
finally
struck
i
now
became
for
the
first
time
thoroughly
frightened
during
the
whole
scene
that
i
have
been
describing
i
had
never
felt
much
fear
while
i
was
untying
the
rope
the
balls
came
so
thick
that
the
flesh
on
my
ribs
twitched
a
little
moore
says
he
could
not
help
dodging
when
the
bullets
flew
so
thick
and
close
dafney
laughed
and
asked
if
he
thought
he
could
dodge
them
it
would
have
been
an
easy
matter
for
the
robbers
to
have
come
on
and
got
to
the
crossing
ahead
of
us
and
ambushed
us
as
the
brush
was
thick
on
each
side
of
the
road
this
i
fully
realized
and
insisted
that
we
should
not
take
the
road
but
to
no
purpose
the
others
felt
that
we
had
got
clear
and
that
it
would
be
best
to
keep
on
to
the
next
ranch
some
forty
miles
distant
this
we
reached
about
sunrise
moore
and
i
rode
all
night
bareback
most
of
the
time
on
a
hard
trot
we
arrived
at
zan
hicklin
on
the
green
horn
river
early
in
the
morning
hicklin
was
an
old
acquaintance
and
treated
us
kindly
furnishing
us
with
saddles
and
blankets
and
such
provisions
as
we
could
take
we
stayed
with
him
three
days
before
we
were
able
to
travel
on
being
so
sore
from
our
bareback
feat
the
night
after
our
arrival
hicklin
sent
back
a
man
to
where
we
were
robbed
the
man
reported
finding
the
wagon
all
right
with
a
sack
of
bacon
and
some
horse
feed
also
the
dead
mules
and
some
parts
of
the
harness
all
the
light
straps
being
taken
from
all
the
signs
we
judged
the
robbers
to
be
mexicans
hicklin
offered
to
get
the
wagon
for
us
but
we
felt
like
getting
home
the
quickest
and
best
way
and
thought
best
to
take
it
muleback
so
we
told
hicklin
to
get
the
wagon
and
keep
it
when
we
started
on
we
had
but
little
money
and
very
poor
clothes
as
we
were
saving
our
good
ones
that
we
had
bought
in
santa
fe
until
we
got
home
but
we
had
two
first
class
mules
about
as
fine
ones
as
are
often
seen
and
we
made
up
our
minds
to
make
as
quick
a
trip
home
as
possible
our
friends
dafney
and
companion
were
well
mounted
they
were
going
the
same
road
as
far
as
denver
they
got
away
with
several
hundred
dollars
carried
on
their
persons
moore
and
i
had
expended
our
cash
all
but
a
few
dollars
our
friends
were
liberal
while
we
traveled
together
paying
most
of
the
expenses
the
country
was
just
being
settled
there
was
but
one
house
where
pueblo
now
is
besides
the
old
shanties
where
the
mormon
company
wintered
in
from
pueblo
to
denver
there
were
a
few
new
farms
just
started
there
were
several
cities
by
name
but
no
one
living
in
them
these
were
started
to
boom
some
mining
camps
but
the
prospect
failing
the
city
also
was
abandoned
some
of
these
places
are
only
remembered
by
a
few
of
the
old
prospectors
never
having
been
put
upon
record
we
stopped
one
night
with
quite
a
pleasant
thrifty
settler
on
the
fountain
creek
during
the
evening
he
told
us
that
he
had
lost
quite
a
number
of
horses
some
thirty
or
forty
head
mostly
good
american
mares
and
young
stock
he
had
spent
much
time
hunting
them
and
finally
given
them
up
supposing
that
they
had
been
stolen
and
taken
entirely
out
of
the
country
the
road
from
this
place
continued
on
up
fountain
creek
for
some
thirty
miles
then
crossed
over
and
down
to
cherry
creek
estimated
miles
from
this
place
to
the
next
station
where
we
could
find
a
stopping
place
this
looked
like
having
to
camp
out
something
we
were
not
prepared
to
do
again
we
still
were
timid
not
having
recovered
from
our
stampede
we
felt
much
better
when
in
a
safe
place
our
landlord
told
us
of
a
more
direct
route
that
he
had
recommended
to
different
ones
and
tried
to
get
opened
through
that
would
shorten
the
distance
about
half
from
his
place
to
cherry
city
there
was
no
trail
through
but
the
country
looked
open
and
favorable
and
as
our
host
had
been
kind
to
us
and
manifested
quite
a
desire
to
have
us
go
through
after
receiving
his
directions
and
locating
the
points
where
the
country
showed
best
we
started
out
after
traveling
about
forty
miles
we
saw
quite
a
bunch
of
horses
on
approaching
them
we
discovered
from
the
brands
and
descriptions
given
us
that
they
were
the
lost
stock
of
our
kind
entertainer
not
long
after
seeing
the
horses
we
struck
the
main
road
having
saved
many
miles
of
travel
as
our
route
was
almost
direct
while
the
old
road
was
very
crooked
soon
after
striking
the
road
we
met
a
train
by
which
we
sent
a
note
to
the
owner
where
his
horses
were
after
getting
home
we
received
a
letter
acknowledging
our
act
and
saying
the
animals
were
his
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
stock
but
have
often
thought
of
the
circumstance
for
i
will
admit
that
we
were
tempted
at
first
to
try
to
make
something
out
of
the
find
notwithstanding
our
loss
and
sore
feelings
we
found
much
on
the
trip
to
amuse
and
entertain
us
two
of
us
were
missourians
dafney
and
i
the
other
two
were
yankees
the
settlers
along
the
route
were
mixed
some
missourians
others
eastern
people
the
question
generally
was
shall
we
stop
with
a
dirty
missourian
or
a
stingy
yankee
we
finally
agreed
to
take
it
time
about
as
much
as
possible
various
signs
were
put
up
along
the
road
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
traveler
one
i
remember
read
something
like
this
bran
coal
pies
hay
whisky
eggs
and
other
fruit
chapter
xxv
martin
cruel
treatment
of
us
baker
kindness
our
journey
home
reception
by
our
families
our
claim
against
the
government
we
expected
to
get
some
assistance
from
a
man
by
the
name
of
william
martin
whom
we
were
acquainted
with
he
had
been
at
provo
merchandising
but
had
moved
to
denver
on
arriving
in
denver
and
meeting
martin
we
told
him
our
situation
he
very
readily
said
we
could
have
what
we
wanted
and
asked
how
much
we
would
need
i
told
him
dollars
would
answer
it
was
about
noon
and
he
said
wait
and
have
some
dinner
then
you
can
go
on
he
stepped
out
but
returned
in
a
few
minutes
asking
whose
fine
mules
are
those
under
the
shed
i
replied
they
are
ours
he
said
they
are
fine
mules
i
will
give
you
a
good
trade
for
them
and
then
offered
us
a
pair
of
ponies
and
dollars
i
told
him
they
were
all
we
had
left
of
what
we
had
earned
during
our
trip
that
we
were
anxious
to
get
home
as
soon
as
possible
and
that
they
would
carry
us
better
than
the
ponies
would
i
knew
the
ponies
well
that
he
offered
us
he
insisted
on
the
trade
we
declined
as
the
mules
were
worth
at
least
while
the
ponies
were
not
worth
over
if
he
gave
us
the
difference
he
would
still
get
at
least
for
nothing
finally
when
we
would
not
trade
martin
said
he
had
no
money
to
loan
he
had
a
large
provision
store
and
i
said
then
let
us
have
a
little
provisions
and
we
will
go
on
he
replied
that
he
was
selling
on
commission
and
could
let
nothing
go
without
the
money
if
ever
two
men
felt
indignant
we
did
we
had
parted
company
with
our
friends
the
two
horsemen
they
still
had
plenty
of
money
they
doubtless
would
have
given
us
some
had
we
asked
them
but
we
were
sure
of
getting
some
from
martin
i
also
had
several
old
acquaintances
in
denver
who
no
doubt
would
have
helped
us
but
we
felt
now
like
asking
no
assistance
from
any
person
we
had
just
forty
cents
and
were
four
hundred
miles
from
old
jack
robinson
camp
at
bridger
we
know
he
would
not
turn
us
away
my
answer
to
martin
was
bill
martin
you
see
these
two
mules
they
are
better
animals
than
you
ought
to
own
it
is
only
four
hundred
miles
to
jack
robinson
they
will
carry
us
there
in
four
days
we
can
starve
that
long
and
you
ca
have
the
mules
good
day
we
bought
forty
cents
worth
of
cheap
cakes
and
started
out
with
the
expectation
of
going
hungry
as
we
crossed
the
bridge
spanning
the
arkansas
river
the
roads
forked
we
enquired
of
a
lad
which
road
to
take
naming
our
direction
he
said
either
but
that
the
left
hand
road
went
out
five
miles
to
jim
baker
ranch
here
was
a
chance
jim
baker
was
an
old
friend
that
i
had
often
met
on
the
plains
i
had
taken
care
of
his
brother
when
while
we
were
at
devil
gate
so
we
concluded
to
go
there
and
see
if
baker
would
be
like
martin
on
arriving
we
were
welcomed
in
the
true
style
although
grass
was
abundant
he
turned
our
mules
into
his
oat
field
we
told
him
about
martin
and
he
said
well
now
i
will
go
into
town
every
saturday
get
drunk
and
abuse
martin
for
this
until
i
run
him
out
of
the
country
i
will
never
let
up
on
him
why
he
aint
fit
to
live
baker
had
his
squaw
fix
us
up
some
food
all
we
would
take
next
morning
we
started
on
feeling
much
better
than
when
leaving
denver
we
met
with
others
along
the
road
who
supplied
our
wants
while
at
bitter
creek
one
of
our
mules
got
poisoned
with
bad
water
we
got
him
as
far
as
jack
robinson
camp
leaving
him
and
getting
another
on
reaching
bridger
we
overtook
a
government
outfit
coming
into
camp
floyd
captain
clery
and
escort
the
captain
was
on
his
way
to
relieve
the
then
acting
quartermaster
he
offered
to
supply
us
if
we
would
travel
with
him
as
they
did
not
know
the
road
we
traveled
with
him
two
days
receiving
the
best
of
treatment
from
officers
and
men
our
route
led
down
provo
canyon
i
had
a
number
of
acquaintances
in
this
valley
among
the
number
melvin
ross
who
lived
at
the
head
of
the
valley
he
was
a
man
of
considerable
means
i
told
moore
we
would
go
and
camp
with
him
telling
how
welcome
we
would
be
there
was
a
sergeant
in
the
company
who
knew
the
road
from
weber
neither
moore
nor
myself
had
traveled
the
road
from
weber
to
provo
valley
we
went
ahead
and
took
the
wrong
road
so
that
we
lost
several
miles
in
getting
back
to
the
provo
road
in
the
meantime
the
soldiers
passed
on
and
got
ahead
of
us
this
plagued
us
a
little
but
we
concluded
to
keep
it
to
ourselves
when
we
finally
arrived
at
ross
ranch
we
found
the
soldiers
had
passed
and
were
camped
a
short
distance
down
the
road
ross
was
out
in
front
of
his
house
just
laying
out
a
big
fat
mutton
dressed
he
knew
me
but
spoke
rather
coolly
for
an
old
friend
but
asked
us
to
get
down
i
told
him
we
would
like
to
stop
and
get
something
to
eat
and
stay
all
night
but
that
we
were
without
money
he
replied
that
we
had
some
good
ropes
and
blankets
i
told
him
we
needed
them
as
we
might
go
on
down
the
canyon
and
camp
for
we
were
anxious
to
get
home
to
our
families
he
said
there
was
good
camping
down
the
canyon
i
thought
he
was
doing
this
simply
to
joke
us
but
not
so
we
finally
started
on
but
expecting
to
be
celled
back
and
laughed
at
moore
commenced
laughing
at
me
saying
that
your
friend
is
it
i
said
he
call
us
back
he
can
not
mean
this
only
as
a
joke
moore
said
nary
a
joke
that
man
in
earnest
i
felt
just
about
as
bad
as
i
ever
remember
to
have
felt
we
had
been
running
the
gauntlet
for
several
hundred
miles
among
strangers
looking
forward
with
great
expectations
on
reaching
friends
at
home
we
had
traveled
miles
since
eating
this
we
told
ross
but
not
a
bite
would
he
let
us
have
unless
we
gave
him
a
rope
or
blanket
this
seemed
so
mean
that
we
would
rather
have
traveled
all
next
day
without
food
than
to
ask
anyone
again
when
we
came
up
to
the
soldier
camp
they
asked
us
to
stop
and
have
supper
our
mules
were
fed
oats
and
turned
out
we
said
nothing
about
the
grand
reception
we
had
had
as
we
were
ashamed
to
mention
it
we
stayed
till
about
eleven
and
then
went
on
down
the
canyon
and
laid
out
a
short
distance
from
several
old
friends
and
acquaintances
we
dared
not
call
on
anyone
so
early
next
morning
we
started
for
our
homes
in
provo
joking
each
other
often
and
wondering
if
our
wives
would
treat
us
as
ross
had
we
had
made
considerable
money
every
one
of
our
acquaintances
expected
us
back
with
plenty
of
course
our
wives
expected
us
to
come
home
benefitted
by
the
summer
trip
but
all
was
lost
and
we
were
ragged
and
worn
and
presented
anything
but
a
dudish
appearance
i
will
not
do
our
wives
the
injustice
to
say
that
we
felt
any
doubt
of
the
reception
we
would
receive
at
home
they
were
sisters
and
two
as
good
and
faithful
women
as
ever
existed
we
had
no
fears
although
we
made
many
propositions
suggestive
of
their
shutting
us
out
our
reception
was
such
as
true
wives
always
give
all
the
more
kind
because
of
our
misfortune
i
do
not
think
i
ever
heard
a
word
of
regret
spoken
by
either
of
them
for
the
loss
of
our
property
so
thankful
were
they
for
our
lives
being
spared
under
the
great
risk
we
ran
i
wrote
on
to
canby
adjutant
who
during
the
winter
was
sent
down
to
washington
about
the
time
the
civil
war
broke
out
i
got
a
letter
stating
that
i
would
get
the
money
for
our
losses
but
the
officer
attending
to
it
was
probably
killed
in
the
war
as
i
never
heard
any
more
from
him
many
of
the
military
officers
to
whom
i
have
related
the
circumstance
of
our
being
pressed
into
service
tell
me
the
claim
can
be
collected
it
certainly
is
due
to
us
for
we
have
never
as
yet
received
any
benefit
for
our
services
acting
on
the
suggestions
of
some
of
the
army
officers
i
got
together
sufficient
affidavits
to
establish
the
facts
here
recorded
making
my
claim
according
to
facts
my
papers
were
all
returned
to
me
with
the
statement
that
inasmuch
as
we
were
robbed
by
parties
other
than
indians
that
nothing
could
be
done
for
us
some
have
advised
me
to
change
my
papers
and
say
that
indians
were
the
depredators
and
make
the
claim
accordingly
this
i
shall
not
do
as
there
is
enough
laid
to
the
indians
already
if
i
ever
get
anything
it
will
be
on
the
justice
of
the
claim
just
as
it
occurred
and
not
by
charging
it
to
the
indians

as
i
do
not
consider
an
account
of
my
home
life
of
any
particular
interest
to
the
general
reader
i
will
give
only
a
brief
sketch
of
it
on
returning
and
settling
up
with
bachman
and
hanks
who
had
furnished
much
of
our
trade
supply
i
found
i
would
have
to
sell
my
home
to
pay
them
in
i
went
to
provo
valley
and
took
up
land
on
snake
creek
where
i
fenced
a
farm
built
a
house
and
corrals
and
raised
a
crop
of
wheat
and
potatoes
and
while
binding
wheat
had
to
wear
a
heavy
coat
and
woolen
mittens
as
the
weather
was
so
cold
after
gathering
in
my
crop
i
concluded
to
return
to
provo
and
work
at
sadlery
expecting
to
go
back
in
the
spring
and
continue
farming
during
the
early
spring
a
flood
come
and
destroyed
the
road
through
provo
canyon
stopping
all
travel
in
the
fall
of
a
company
was
organized
to
rebuild
the
road
the
funds
being
furnished
by
voluntary
contribution
shadrick
holdaway
chas
kenedey
and
i
were
chosen
as
committee
i
being
selected
as
secretary
and
treasurer
having
taken
the
work
in
hand
it
was
pushed
forward
with
considerable
force
i
was
greatly
interested
as
i
wished
to
get
back
to
my
farm
and
could
only
do
so
by
going
round
by
salt
lake
city
and
through
the
park
to
the
valley
a
distance
of
nearly
one
hundred
miles
while
the
direct
route
was
only
miles
neither
did
i
wish
to
be
cut
off
from
provo
which
i
considered
my
real
home
many
times
i
found
funds
hard
to
raise
so
much
so
that
finally
in
a
i
sold
my
farm
to
help
on
the
road
so
that
by
the
time
the
road
was
finished
and
paid
for
i
had
no
individual
use
for
it
but
like
many
others
of
my
labors
for
public
good
my
pay
was
in
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
the
work
finished
so
as
to
be
of
use
to
illustrate
my
situation
and
extremes
in
making
payments
i
will
relate
one
circumstance
the
whole
funds
contributed
were
left
in
the
hands
of
the
contributors
until
wanted
all
donations
being
named
some
donated
flour
others
potatoes
wood
lumber
and
any
and
everything
in
the
shape
of
produce
being
on
the
list
when
jobs
on
the
road
were
finished
and
accepted
by
the
two
other
committee
men
they
would
draw
an
order
on
the
treasurer
who
would
have
to
draw
on
the
contributors
sometimes
the
means
would
not
be
just
ready
to
the
day
but
almost
invariably
donators
paid
honorably
in
fact
i
have
no
remembrance
of
a
single
instance
where
agreements
made
were
not
fulfilled
in
good
time
there
was
one
company
of
welshmen
that
took
a
contract
amounting
to
twelve
hundred
dollars
the
committee
docked
them
their
job
not
being
up
to
contract
this
soured
them
so
much
that
they
sought
to
make
trouble
with
me
about
their
pay
allowing
me
no
time
whatever
to
settle
up
in
the
usual
manner
after
paying
all
but
some
fifty
dollars
i
asked
a
little
time
to
see
who
was
ready
to
pay
that
amount
i
was
given
to
understand
that
not
much
time
would
be
allowed
so
i
gave
them
an
order
where
i
supposed
it
would
be
paid
but
the
party
not
being
quite
ready
asked
them
to
wait
a
few
days
and
he
would
settle
this
they
would
not
do
but
three
of
them
returned
to
my
house
to
whip
me
i
tried
to
reason
with
them
but
to
no
purpose
a
row
had
to
be
had
i
ordered
them
out
of
my
house
they
went
out
picking
up
rocks
and
stood
facing
my
door
and
abusing
me
and
daring
me
out
i
grabbed
a
pair
of
hames
fastened
at
the
top
with
a
strap
without
describing
all
that
occurred
i
did
not
get
hurt
but
paid
a
cow
and
calf
for
damages
done
to
the
leader
of
the
party
when
the
row
was
over
i
started
to
the
nearest
alderman
to
complain
about
myself
just
as
i
approached
meeting
the
officer
in
his
a
man
came
driving
his
team
up
the
street
on
a
full
run
and
shouting
at
the
top
of
his
voice
not
to
listen
to
me
but
have
me
arrested
that
i
had
killed
a
man
and
nearly
killed
a
lot
more
this
so
enraged
me
that
i
gathered
up
some
rocks
and
commenced
war
upon
him
turning
him
back
and
chasing
him
down
the
street
team
and
all
the
alderman
fined
me
five
dollars
on
my
own
complaint
but
nothing
for
chasing
bob
caldwell
and
team
for
a
short
time
there
were
hard
feelings
in
the
community
against
me
i
knew
that
i
had
been
both
hasty
and
severe
and
gave
the
cow
of
my
own
free
will
and
settled
up
with
good
feelings
to
all
parties
after
the
road
was
made
passable
and
all
accounts
settled
i
concluded
to
give
up
the
project
of
becoming
a
farmer
and
stick
to
my
trade
in
those
days
money
was
a
little
more
plentiful
among
business
men
than
before
the
johnston
army
visited
utah
still
much
of
the
business
was
done
with
grain
as
the
circulating
medium
this
made
business
rather
slow
as
at
times
i
would
have
to
load
up
a
wagon
and
go
to
salt
lake
city
taking
from
three
to
five
days
sometimes
going
with
ox
teams
i
would
sell
my
grain
and
return
with
about
as
much
material
as
i
could
carry
under
my
arm
while
on
one
of
my
trips
for
leather
brother
isaac
brockbank
made
me
an
offer
to
come
to
the
city
and
work
for
him
he
being
in
charge
of
william
howard
tannery
shoe
and
harness
factory
considering
this
better
than
the
slow
manner
in
provo
i
moved
to
salt
lake
in
where
i
continued
to
live
and
work
at
my
trade
uninterruptedly
most
of
the
time
i
carried
on
business
until
the
summer
of
during
the
time
i
lived
in
salt
lake
connor
army
occupied
camp
douglas
the
civil
war
was
still
going
on
also
the
black
hawk
war
so
known
in
utah
from
the
fact
that
the
leader
of
the
depredating
utes
who
broke
up
so
many
of
the
frontier
settlements
of
sanpete
and
sevier
counties
was
called
black
hawk
after
the
old
warrior
of
that
name
the
people
of
salt
lake
had
many
duties
to
perform
in
those
days
strong
police
forces
unpaid
had
to
be
kept
ready
as
much
prejudice
and
existed
at
times
there
were
continual
threats
to
arrest
our
leaders
which
caused
the
people
to
be
constantly
on
the
alert
it
is
not
my
intention
to
write
much
in
this
work
except
that
which
the
title
justifies
still
there
are
a
few
incidents
that
certainly
would
be
of
interest
for
dates
i
am
indebted
to
church
chronology
a
landing
and
site
for
a
church
warehouse
afterwards
known
as
callsville
was
selected
by
anson
call
on
the
colorado
river
miles
from
george
and
the
land
along
the
muddy
found
suitable
to
settle
on
it
was
then
contemplated
to
send
the
emigration
from
europe
by
way
of
panama
and
up
the
colorado
river
to
this
landing
which
was
the
head
of
navigation
on
the
river
named
i
believe
that
i
have
heard
about
as
much
criticism
and
against
brigham
young
for
the
effort
made
at
call
landing
to
prepare
for
what
the
above
refers
to
as
anything
that
was
ever
directed
by
him
some
few
persons
were
advised
to
spend
a
few
thousand
dollars
on
the
speculation
it
failed
and
they
have
been
mourning
about
it
ever
since
i
would
ask
how
many
of
brigham
young
enterprises
have
succeeded
his
failures
were
but
few
i
always
felt
to
honor
and
respect
brigham
young
but
i
have
thought
that
men
sometimes
honor
him
more
than
he
asked
or
than
common
sense
could
expect
that
he
was
a
good
adviser
and
generally
clear
headed
on
business
matters
all
who
knew
him
acknowledge
but
that
he
could
never
make
a
mistake
would
have
been
unreasonable
to
expect
the
work
previously
spoken
of
might
have
been
useless
still
i
do
not
think
it
was
and
will
give
some
of
my
reasons
for
thinking
so
i
have
been
much
in
the
far
south
have
watched
and
studied
the
interests
and
progress
of
the
southern
country
and
its
developments
i
know
that
president
young
mind
for
some
reason
was
much
drawn
towards
southern
utah
arizona
and
mexico
the
settling
of
george
and
other
places
considered
desert
wastes
the
building
of
the
temple
all
show
this
in
carrying
out
this
move
as
far
as
it
went
a
road
had
to
be
opened
up
as
far
as
the
river
soon
this
road
was
opened
farther
on
into
arizona
thus
a
thoroughfare
such
as
the
country
would
support
was
opened
up
now
clear
through
to
some
of
the
most
fertile
valleys
of
arizona
and
mexico
some
have
been
settled
by
our
people
and
others
will
be
in
time
as
the
best
are
not
yet
occupied
the
commencement
of
the
black
hawk
war
was
in
the
immediate
cause
was
the
whipping
of
an
indian
by
a
white
man
this
occurred

by
this

the
people
of

began
to
get
into
shape
to
protect
themselves
better
than
they
were
at
first
so
that
during
the
years
and
not
many
were
killed
but
raids
were
still
common
the
indians
often
getting
away
with
stock
companies
of
home
militia
were
sent
out
to
guard
and
assist
the
settlements
records
shows
that
general
connor
and
his
army
occupied
camp
douglas
during
the
whole
time
of
this
bloodshed
but
i
can
not
find
anything
on
record
showing
that
any
moves
were
made
by
connor
to
assist
or
in
any
way
protect
these
settlements
in
their
distress
neither
does
my
memory
furnish
an
instance
of
help
being
furnished
by
the
troops
stationed
at
camp
douglas
to
the
people
of
sanpete
and
sevier
counties
it
may
be
interesting
to
put
on
record
some
things
that
i
do
remember
for
five
years
from
to
i
lived
in
the
eastern
part
of
salt
lake
city
directly
in
the
exposed
portion
to
the
depredations
of
numbers
of
connor
army
i
know
of
many
instances
where
the
people
were
insulted
and
abused
in
a
violent
manner
often
by
large
parties
of
soldiers
headed
by
officers
in
some
instances
even
commissioned
officers
taking
the
lead
in
lawless
acts
it
was
often
hard
to
tell
which
were
the
most
to
be
dreaded
the
indians
in
the
south
or
the
soldiers
about
the
city
while
the
soldiers
without
organization
or
authority
annoyed
us
the
commander
lent
his
influence
and
offered
his
support
to
our
political
enemies
holding
his
army
over
the
mormons
as
a
continual
menace
the
mormons
are
being
accused
of
disloyalty
possibly
this
is
a
correct
and
just
accusation
owing
to
their
ignorance
of
what
loyalty
means
i
will
not
accuse
any
one
of
disloyalty
simply
because
i
am
in
the
same
dilemma
ignorant
but
will
ask
is
it
right
and
legal
to
fit
out
with
government
supplies
tools
and
animals
and
take
enlisted
men
to
work
prospecting
for
mines
for
private
interests
under
pretence
of
going
to
protect
american
citizens
in
their
legitimate
business
against
the
mormons
or
would
it
be
consistent
to
suppose
that
the
mormons
would
be
able
to
molest
these
prospectors
even
if
so
inclined
when
so
much
occupied
in
protecting
themselves
against
the
indians
and
the
more
savage
and
unreasonable
attacks
of
the
soldiers
again
is
it
legal
to
sell
to
miners
and
freighters
by
the
thousands
and
then
to
allow
the
commissary
to
get
fire
and
burn
down
allowing
this
fire
to
get
so
extremely
hot
as
to
burn
up
by
the
hundreds
now
the
mormons
have
never
taken
part
in
anything
of
this
kind
they
are
called
disloyal
i
do
decline
to
be
sworn
on
the
subject
but
rumor
says
that
these
things
were
done
and
headed
by
parties
who
are
now
called
intensely
loyal
during
the
war
with
the
indians
numbers
of
them
were
killed
and
wounded
about
the
year
or
there
was
some
little
effort
made
to
bring
about
a
peace
brother
huntington
had
a
talk
with
some
in
thistle
valley
who
wished
peace
but
many
thefts
and
small
raids
were
made
after
this
continuing
from
time
to
time
the
indians
began
to
have
a
dread
of
some
settlements
as
guards
and
patrols
were
out
at
times
one
small
party
had
stolen
some
stock
from
provo
valley
they
were
killing
a
beef
when
they
were
surprised
and
all
killed
the
indians
acknowledged
to
me
that
they
were
afraid
of
provo
and
valley
people

sharp
to
which
i
belonged
had
already
been
called
upon
for
a
detail
captain
crow
and
company
having
spent
sometime
in
sanpete
about
the
next
call
would
have
been
for
my
company
as
we
belonged
to
the
same
regiment
my
mind
and
feelings
were
much
exercised
over
these
matters
for
i
could
not
refuse
to
go
in
my
turn
as
no
possible
explanation
could
be
given
to
relieve
me
from
the
suspicion
of
cowardice
many
times
in
reflecting
upon
the
subject
my
feelings
were
to
go
and
see
the
indians
personally
although
they
were
at
war
and
had
been
for
some
six
or
eight
years
and
killed
numbers
of
our
people
breaking
up
whole
districts
still
i
felt
as
though
i
would
rather
approach
them
as
a
peacemaker
than
as
a
fighter
luckily
one
day
in
the
summer
of
i
met
an
indian
that
i
recognized
at
once
as
an
old
acquaintance
ancatowats
to
the
reader
who
is
not
acquainted
with
those
days
it
will
be
necessary
to
say
that
there
were
friendly
indians
in
and
around
the
settlements
who
took
no
part
in
this
war
but
would
not
inform
on
the
hostiles
when
they
came
in
in
a
peaceable
manner
to
visit
them
i
had
often
heard
of
this
indian
ancatowats
being
one
of
black
hawk
most
active
raiders
when
i
called
him
by
name
he
said
he
did
not
know
me
i
told
him
how
i
felt
towards
the
indians
soon
i
got
his
confidence
and
we
had
a
long
talk
he
told
me
all
about
the
hostiles
and
others
of
the
uintahs
who
were
not
actively
at
war
he
said
the
indians
wished
they
could
get
some
of
my
saddles
i
had
sold
them
a
great
many
in
former
years
said
their
saddles
were
all
gone
or
broken
up
so
that
their
horses
all
had
bruised
backs
he
bought
three
saddles
of
me
at
the
time
he
also
told
me
that
there
was
a
new
agent
in
town
from
washington
whom
he
thought
was
a
good
man
that
he
talked
good
and
that
he
also
wanted
a
saddle
this
indian
said
to
me
that
he
thought
maybe
i
could
go
out
with
the
agent
and
make
saddles
for
the
indians
if
i
wanted
to
and
that
as
i
was
an
old
friend
and
had
never
been
out
to
fight
them
he
did
not
think
they
would
want
to
kill
me
i
went
and
talked
with
george
smith
giving
him
a
full
understanding
of
my
feelings
also
telling
of
the
proposition
of
the
indian
brother
smith
agreed
with
me
that
if
someone
could
get
among
the
indians
and
talk
to
them
in
a
proper
spirit
it
would
do
more
good
than
fighting
them
and
said
if
you
have
faith
to
try
it
you
shall
have
my
faith
and
blessing
in
the
effort
i
laid
before
him
some
of
my
plans
which
he
approved
of
advising
me
to
say
nothing
to
anyone
else
about
the
business
but
to
use
prudence
and
the
best
judgment
possible
he
warned
me
that
i
would
have
a
hard
job
and
hoped
that
i
would
not
get
discouraged
i
managed
to
see
the
agent
and
mentioned
to
him
my
desire
to
visit
the
agency
telling
him
that
i
was
an
interpreter
he
said
if
i
could
bring
a
testimonial
from
some
responsible
party
he
would
employ
me
as
he
wished
someone
who
really
understood
the
indians
and
was
friendly
with
them
to
act
as
interpreter
i
furnished
the
necessary
paper
and
asked
the
privilege
of
taking
my
tools
and
some
material
under
an
agreeable
arrangement
this
was
allowed
i
closed
up
my
business
and
went
in
company
with
the
agent
to
uintah
on
arriving
at
that
place
i
was
notified
by
the
indians
to
leave
within
three
days
or
they
would
kill
me
this
i
was
prepared
to
expect
for
my
indian
friend
in
salt
lake
did
not
speak
very
positively
in
regard
to
my
safety
in
going
but
thought
maybe
it
would
be
all
right
this
word
came
from
tabby
my
old
friend
he
would
not
come
to
see
me
but
sent
word
saying
you
are
an
old
friend
but
the
mormons
have
killed
many
of
my
people
you
are
a
mormon
and
if
you
stay
here
you
will
be
killed
some
are
mad
because
i
do
not
want
you
killed
at
once
now
hurry
and
get
ready
for
i
do
not
want
to
see
you
die
i
went
to
work
feeling
first
rate
and
made
me
a
saddle
within
the
time
some
of
the
indians
would
come
where
i
was
at
work
and
watch
me
but
would
not
speak
i
treated
them
with
perfect
indifference
when
the
saddle
was
done
an
indian
wanted
to
buy
it
i
told
him
i
could
not
sell
it
that
i
had
to
leave
or
the
indians
would
kill
me
he
said
he
would
go
and
see
if
they
would
not
wait
three
days
more
so
that
i
could
let
him
have
the
one
on
hand
i
agreed
he
returned
in
a
few
hours
and
said
it
was
all
right
some
might
ask
could
you
believe
him
i
answer
most
certainly
i
sold
the
saddle
starting
on
another
which
had
the
same
history
thus
continuing
for
some
time
until
i
began
to
feel
quite
at
home
making
saddles
and
selling
them
for
a
good
price
with
the
prospect
of
being
killed
every
three
days
there
is
an
old
saying
that
one
can
get
used
to
almost
anything
except
getting
killed
more
than
once
tabby
often
passed
by
where
i
could
see
him
but
would
never
look
towards
me
i
believed
that
in
his
heart
he
was
my
friend
for
i
was
his
this
looked
a
little
strange
but
understanding
indian
character
so
well
i
knew
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
speak
first
one
day
tabby
stepped
into
my
shop
accompanied
by
his
young
squaw
i
had
my
across
the
room
so
that
i
faced
the
door
all
my
stuff
behind
and
protected
by
the
bench
i
kept
very
busy
scarcely
speaking
to
anyone
coming
in
simply
selling
saddles
under
the
rule
mentioned
he
came
up
to
the
bench
in
haughty
indian
style
never
offering
to
speak
i
felt
almost
like
laughing
for
i
knew
he
was
playing
a
part
and
i
determined
to
beat
him
if
possible
so
i
never
even
looked
up
from
my
work
soon
he
laid
a
new
butcher
knife
down
on
the
bench
without
speaking
a
word
i
took
the
knife
and
made
a
nice
scabbard
for
it
and
laid
it
on
the
bench
before
him
he
then
took
a
pair
of
stirrups
from
his
squaw
and
laid
them
on
the
bench
i
had
a
pair
of
made
and
hanging
up
i
took
them
and
put
them
on
the
stirrups
and
laid
them
down
as
i
had
the
knife
then
went
on
with
my
work
without
taking
any
further
notice
tabby
stood
straight
and
silent
hardly
moving
during
this
he
then
took
from
his
squaw
some
buckskin
and
without
a
word
laid
them
on
my
bench
i
commenced
cleaning
up
giving
my
bench
a
general
straightening
when
i
came
to
the
buckskins
i
handled
them
as
though
they
were
trash
in
my
way
and
asked
the
squaw
if
she
would
not
take
care
of
them
at
this
tabby
laughed
holding
out
his
hand
in
a
friendly
way
saying
all
right
we
are
friends
and
it
is
foolish
for
us
to
not
talk
and
be
as
we
used
to
be
he
then
told
me
that
most
of
the
indians
liked
me
and
thought
i
was
a
friend
but
that
yank
and
his
crowd
thought
i
was
a
spy
and
wanted
to
kill
me
but
that
if
i
could
win
him
i
would
be
all
right
after
this
i
had
much
fear
for
i
did
not
believe
yank
would
kill
me
for
he
needed
a
saddle
very
badly
i
soon
learned
the
general
condition
of
affairs
getting
information
both
from
the
indians
themselves
and
some
of
the
whites
at
the
agency
tabby
and
quite
a
number
of
the
better
disposed
utes
claimed
that
they
never
had
been
at
war
with
the
mormons
but
acknowledged
that
they
had
a
very
bad
feeling
about
the
killing
of
some
of
their
friends
under
circumstances
that
did
not
justify
telling
about
tabby
who
tabby
claims
was
a
friend
and
not
an
enemy
i
myself
knew
of
several
instances
where
indians
were
killed
that
to
me
looked
a
little
crooked
and
when
their
friends
talked
about
these
cases
i
could
not
help
but
admit
sometimes
that
they
had
a
right
to
get
mad
one
indian
known
as
took
quite
a
liking
to
me
and
became
quite
communicative
he
was
very
faithful
never
deceiving
me
he
would
tell
me
how
the
indians
talked
about
me
what
their
plans
were
for
raiding
and
gave
me
advice
how
to
control
their
actions
by
a
little
stratagem
the
season
was
getting
late
coalville
was
selected
as
the
place
to
raid
yank
had
everything
arranged
but
could
not
go
without
a
saddle
as
his
was
about
used
up
jim
advised
me
to
put
him
off
saying
that
if
i
could
do
so
until
snow
fell
that
he
would
not
go
and
perhaps
by
spring
i
could
make
him
good
there
were
a
great
many
wanting
saddles
more
than
i
could
possibly
supply
so
that
it
was
easy
to
put
yank
off
i
allowed
the
idea
to
still
prevail
that
i
had
to
leave
and
would
not
sell
any
indian
a
saddle
without
the
understanding
that
i
could
remain
long
enough
to
make
another
i
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
but
this
suited
me
for
i
had
not
yet
made
terms
with
the
raiders
finally
snow
fell
in
the
mountains
jim
said
now
you
can
let
yank
have
a
saddle
he
will
go
with
the
rest
on
a
hunt
and
not
go
to
coalville
about
this
time
the
greater
number
of
the
utes
were
starting
on
their
fall
hunt
yank
came
in
offering
me
some
buckskins
for
a
saddle
i
told
him
i
was
going
home
that
i
was
afraid
when
tabby
and
the
good
indians
went
away
that
he
would
kill
me
he
said
i
was
a
fool
to
think
so
that
i
was
a
good
man
and
all
the
indians
liked
me
and
none
of
them
would
kill
me
i
then
sold
him
a
saddle
i
had
ready
the
indians
explained
many
things
to
me
about
the
management
at
the
agency
saying
that
the
former
agents
stole
most
that
the
government
sent
them
they
did
not
know
how
the
new
agent
would
be
but
agreed
if
i
would
be
their
friend
and
tell
washington
the
truth
just
how
things
were
done
it
would
be
different
they
believed
washington
was
honest
had
a
kind
heart
and
when
hungry
men
came
to
him
crying
for
something
to
eat
that
he
made
indian
agents
of
them
and
sent
them
out
here
to
the
indians
they
did
not
think
this
was
right
for
they
needed
all
that
the
government
gave
them
and
there
was
nothing
to
spare
for
the
agents
to
steal
without
leaving
the
indians
hungry
tabby
said
that
some
of
brigham
bishops
helped
the
agents
to
steal
and
this
made
the
indians
mad
causing
them
to
raid
upon
the
mormons
and
to
excuse
themselves
by
saying
that
if
the
mormons
did
not
help
to
steal
their
provisions
they
would
have
enough
but
as
it
was
they
had
to
steal
mormon
cattle
and
when
the
mormons
followed
them
sometimes
they
had
to
fight
but
would
just
as
soon
get
the
beef
without
killing
anyone
as
to
have
to
kill
them
the
question
may
be
asked
was
there
any
truth
or
reason
in
this
i
thought
at
one
time
of
writing
up
some
facts
that
can
be
proved
giving
circumstances
and
names
which
would
clearly
show
that
the
indians
had
reason
to
talk
as
they
did
if
blood
was
shed
and
the
cause
originated
through
the
speculative
act
of
some
man
who
ought
to
have
known
better
the
day
of
reckoning
will
come
without
my
calling
them
to
account
in
this
little
history
after
becoming
acquainted
with
the
condition
of
affairs
at
the
uintah
and
the
white
river
agency
i
made
up
my
mind
to
act
as
a
friend
to
the
indians
in
trying
to
get
something
done
to
better
their
condition
that
there
had
been
a
great
deal
of
neglect
and
crookedness
going
on
for
years
no
one
could
doubt
reports
were
circulated
that
some
of
the
government
officials
prior
to
this
time
had
encouraged
the
indians
in
stealing
cattle
from
the
mormons
thinking
that
if
the
indians
supplied
themselves
with
beef
they
could
better
appropriate
what
government
furnished
than
when
the
utes
were
peaceable
and
not
stealing
the
new
agent
was
very
emphatic
in
his
denunciations
of
former
agents
he
seemed
disposed
to
change
the
management
and
work
for
the
good
of
the
natives
he
asked
me
to
find
how
the
indians
felt
and
to
assist
him
in
every
way
possible
to
get
things
in
good
order
and
work
to
make
the
indians
happy
and
contented
i
felt
much
pleasure
in
the
prospective
work
before
me
after
i
had
been
in
the
agency
a
few
weeks
the
agent
started
to
salt
lake
city
to
buy
winter
supplies
he
instructed
me
to
come
in
and
bring
his
team
and
light
wagon
in
a
few
days
after
his
leaving
i
got
ready
to
start
in
according
to
previous
arrangements
i
was
to
have
the
right
to
take
in
with
the
agent
team
the
buckskins
and
furs
that
i
had
received
for
saddles
as
far
as
i
knew
good
feeling
existed
between
the
agent
and
myself
but
when
i
was
ready
to
start
in
the
clerk
then
in
charge
told
me
that
the
agent
had
instructed
him
not
to
allow
me
to
haul
any
of
my
stuff
in
his
wagon
that
i
was
to
take
the
wagon
in
empty
george
basor
the
post
trader
and
a
morgan
blacksmith
were
going
in
with
me
they
told
me
that
for
some
cause
the
agent
had
gone
back
on
me
but
i
concluded
not
to
go
back
on
myself
so
i
got
my
skins
and
furs
ready
the
clerk
at
first
forbade
me
to
load
them
in
but
soon
took
another
notion
and
assisted
me
to
load
the
stuff
into
the
wagon
after
the
agent
had
left
the
clerk
in
charge
business
was
carried
on
in
a
very
bad
manner
quite
a
crop
of
potatoes
had
been
raised
the
weather
commenced
to
grow
cold
potatoes
freezing
instead
of
digging
and
taking
care
each
day
of
the
potatoes
dug
he
would
have
all
hands
dig
all
they
could
and
then
try
to
get
all
hands
mechanics
cooks
and
all
to
gather
them
in
after
night
while
working
in
this
manner
the
indians
were
not
allowed
to
help
but
at
the
same
time
the
most
of
these
potatoes
were
expected
to
be
eaten
by
the
indians
many
other
things
as
foolish
were
being
done
daily
i
kept
a
memorandum
intending
to
report
to
the
agent
according
to
my
agreement
with
him
about
the
time
basor
morgan
and
myself
were
ready
to
start
in
the
first
severe
snow
storm
of
the
season
commenced
we
had
quite
a
hard
trip
getting
into
the
valley

sessions
accompanies
me
our
terrible
journey
and
sufferings
reception
at
the
agency
on
arriving
in
salt
lake
in
company
with
morgan
the
agency
blacksmith
who
had
been
discharged
by
the
clerk
because
he
refused
to
put
long
sharp
corks
on
the
agent
team
which
would
have
cut
them
while
floundering
through
deep
such
as
we
would
encounter
on
the
road
which
any
experienced
man
knows
is
correct
but
the
clerk
like
many
others
felt
that
a
little
authority
must
of
necessity
make
him
wise
thought
differently
on
reporting
the
clerk
to
the
agent
we
were
considerably
surprised
at
his
answer
to
us
he
told
us
that
the
clerk
suited
him
and
if
we
did
not
like
him
we
could
stay
away
from
the
agency
i
told
him
that
tom
layton
was
a
fraud
on
honesty
and
good
sense
and
if
he
felt
to
uphold
him
he
was
a
different
man
from
what
i
supposed
him
to
be
i
wanted
to
know
why
he
instructed
me
to
notice
how
the
affairs
were
conducted
and
report
facts
which
i
had
done
and
could
prove
all
i
said
and
then
treat
my
information
in
the
way
he
did
the
agent
told
me
he
did
not
want
me
any
more
and
would
discharge
me
from
his
service
and
forbade
me
going
to
the
agency
i
answered
that
whether
he
discharged
me
or
not
i
had
business
at
the
agency
and
calculated
to
visit
there
whether
he
wanted
me
to
do
so
or
not
he
replied
that
it
was
now
late
in
the
season
and
that
he
expected
much
trouble
in
getting
his
through
that
was
now
about
starting
from
heber
city
with
flour
and
other
provisions
and
that
he
forbade
my
going
with
them
he
then
rather
derisively
remarked
that
he
did
not
think
that
i
would
be
able
to
make
the
trip
that
he
thought
it
would
be
about
as
much
as
he
could
do
with
the
government
to
back
him
up
to
get
back
to
uintah
and
hardly
thought
any
one
else
would
try
the
trip
so
late
in
the
season
i
told
him
there
was
not
enough
snow
for
me
yet
but
after
a
while
when
traveling
was
good
i
would
call
over
and
see
him
i
had
already
studied
out
my
campaign
for
the
winter
before
leaving
the
uintah
agency
i
had
promised
the
indians
that
i
would
return
and
do
all
i
could
for
them
they
wanted
me
to
try
and
get
the
place
of
trader
there
were
many
things
they
wanted
that
they
could
not
get
among
the
rest
children
woolen
shirts
and
dresses
of
various
sizes
my
wife
went
to
work
with
the
assistance
of
some
of
our
neighbors
particularly
that
of
the
sisters
brower
of
the
ward
and
made
a
lot
of
such
as
were
needed
the
agent
left
sometime
in
november
the
trip
had
never
been
made
in
the
winter
by
anyone
as
the
snow
often
fell
from
fifteen
to
twenty
feet
on
the
mountains
that
had
to
be
crossed
so
when
i
spoke
of
going
many
of
my
friends
considered
me
a
little
crazy
i
knew
the
work
before
me
that
i
had
so
much
interest
in
and
that
was
making
permanent
peace
with
the
indians
could
only
be
accomplished
by
keeping
my
word
with
them
and
gaining
their
entire
confidence
so
i
determined
to
go
or
perish
in
the
attempt
i
knew
that
i
was
engaged
in
a
good
work
and
fully
believed
that
i
would
be
preserved
and
strengthened
according
to
the
undertaking
i
knew
the
country
i
had
to
travel
was
rough
in
the
extreme
with
high
mountains
and
deep
rough
canyons
following
the
road
would
be
of
no
use
as
it
would
be
entirely
covered
with
snow
several
feet
deep
so
i
made
up
my
mind
to
wait
until
mid
winter
when
the
snow
was
deepest
and
take
as
direct
a
route
as
possible
with
the
assistance
of
calvin
ensign
i
constructed
a
sled
of
peculiar
and
original
pattern
one
thing
was
certain
unless
good
sleeping
arrangements
could
be
provided
we
would
perish
at
night
the
sled
was
long
enough
and
of
size
and
shape
so
that
two
could
sleep
in
it
by
lapping
our
feet
and
legs
to
the
knees
each
one
taking
his
end
we
took
in
provisions
goods
and
bedding
to
nearly
four
hundred
pounds
weight
my
wife
assisted
me
in
every
way
possible
in
getting
ready
with
a
kind
cheerful
spirit
manifesting
no
uneasiness
whatever
as
i
have
before
mentioned
whenever
my
labors
were
among
the
indians
she
sympathized
with
me
fully
eight
days
before
i
started
a
son
was
born
to
me
my
wife
was
confined
to
her
bed
when
i
started
i
waited
as
long
a
time
as
possible
but
there
was
now
plenty
of
snow
i
started
i
hired
murdock
of
provo
valley
to
take
my
sled
to
heber
city
i
had
not
yet
found
any
person
to
go
with
me
expecting
to
procure
some
one
in
provo
valley
as
there
were
a
number
of
hardy
venturesome
persons
living
there
who
were
in
the
habit
of
going
out
for
days
on
hunting
elk
and
trapping
beaver
on
arriving
there
i
found
bradley
sessions
a
mormon
battalion
boy
willing
to
undertake
the
trip
i
told
him
all
i
wanted
him
to
agree
was
that
if
we
perished
on
the
trip
he
would
agree
with
me
that
we
would
not
grumble
but
die
uncomplainingly
that
under
no
circumstances
were
we
to
give
up
or
turn
back
he
said
all
right
i
will
stay
with
you
and
he
did
brother
sessions
furnished
me
with
a
pair
of
snowshoes
i
had
prepared
almost
everything
else
needed
for
two
before
leaving
the
city
so
that
we
were
soon
ready
to
start
on
leaving
heber
city
we
took
the
most
direct
road
over
the
pass
leading
down
into
the
west
fork
of
the
duchesne
then
down
to
the
main
stream
intersecting
the
government
road
not
far
from
where
it
crosses
this
stream
the
divide
is
too
steep
for
a
wagon
road
but
part
of
the
way
up
had
been
used
for
carting
timber
down
to
a
mill
near
the
foot
hills
there
was
a
sled
road
some
few
miles
out
from
heber
city
to
this
mill
brother
john
duke
hauled
our
sled
that
far
with
his
team
here
we
made
our
first
camp
in
an
old
house
i
had
taken
from
the
city
a
large
strong
dog
with
the
idea
of
having
a
camp
guard
as
wolves
and
other
wild
animals
were
in
the
mountains
we
had
a
few
light
tools
along
with
us
for
repairing
our
sled
in
case
of
accident
and
brother
sessions
wished
to
take
along
a
few
beaver
traps
our
load
already
being
heavy
and
the
traps
awkward
to
load
among
our
bedding
as
our
whole
load
of
goods
were
arranged
in
convenient
shape
for
a
bed
we
concluded
to
make
a
sled
and
harness
our
dog
to
it
to
pull
the
traps
we
got
some
sticks
with
crooked
ends
and
spent
the
evening
making
a
rig
for
the
dog
when
harnessed
up
next
morning
he
acted
rather
unruly
we
found
the
snow
lighter
than
we
expected
the
winter
had
been
continually
cold
the
snows
deep
and
not
yet
settled
or
packed
but
we
had
started
out
to
stay
with
it
and
did
not
intend
to
give
up
we
found
it
impossible
to
move
our
sled
on
the
snow
until
a
road
was
packed
accordingly
we
would
take
a
few
handy
articles
on
our
backs
and
with
our
five
feet
long
and
some
fifteen
inches
wide
go
forward
tramping
a
trail
wide
enough
for
our
sled
the
dog
following
with
his
load
after
tramping
a
mile
or
two
we
would
return
and
bring
up
our
sled
the
main
trouble
we
had
was
with
our
dog
chasing
the
little
pine
squirrels
running
after
them
sled
and
all
and
getting
overturned
or
hung
among
the
trees
we
would
have
to
straighten
him
out
we
did
not
like
to
thrash
him
for
fear
he
would
run
off
as
he
seemed
a
little
disposed
to
get
away
from
us
this
tramping
road
and
having
to
double
on
our
tracks
was
very
laborious
many
times
even
after
tramping
the
road
the
way
was
so
steep
that
it
took
all
our
strength
to
move
the
sled
a
few
rods
at
a
time
but
when
an
easy
grade
was
reached
we
walked
along
quite
easily
with
our
four
hundred
pound
load
we
were
five
days
in
reaching
the
summit
when
there
we
could
look
back
and
see
heber
city
some
twenty
miles
distant
this
looked
a
little
trying
to
us
as
our
provisions
were
wasting
away
very
fast
our
dog
seemed
to
understand
the
situation
and
rebelled
i
had
hard
work
to
conquer
him
heretofore
we
had
coaxed
him
along
but
it
now
became
necessary
to
make
him
mind
as
bolognes
were
getting
too
scarce
to
feed
him
more
than
his
share
we
crossed
the
divide
at
the
head
of
the
west
fork
of
the
duchesne
the
weather
was
so
cold
that
we
were
afraid
to
halt
for
dinner
until
we
had
descended
quite
a
distance
from
the
summit
once
we
halted
among
some
dry
trees
intending
to
get
dinner
but
the
wind
blew
so
cold
that
we
were
forced
to
swallow
a
few
bits
of
frozen
meat
and
go
on
we
naturally
expected
that
the
descent
would
be
much
easier
and
more
rapid
than
pulling
up
the
mountain
in
this
we
were
mistaken
owing
to
the
wind
blowing
the
light
snow
from
the
mountain
tops
which
settled
down
into
the
canyon
much
of
the
time
we
had
to
tramp
and
make
road
before
we
could
move
along
sometimes
the
whole
bottom
was
covered
with
willows
the
tops
sticking
out
and
holding
the
snow
up
so
light
that
we
had
to
cut
and
tramp
them
into
the
snow
before
we
could
move
our
sled
along
while
passing
the
narrows
we
had
to
make
a
dug
way
for
quite
a
distance
still
we
pressed
forward
neither
could
we
abandon
our
sled
or
goods
for
the
sled
was
our
salvation
to
sleep
in
almost
any
night
we
would
have
perished
with
cold
without
our
the
goods
we
were
taking
were
promised
and
the
influence
i
desired
to
gain
with
the
indians
would
greatly
depend
upon
successfully
reaching
them
with
the
outfit
when
i
made
them
the
promise
i
expected
to
go
out
with
the
agent
and
take
these
things
with
me
but
when
he
forbade
me
going
it
only
raised
my
ire
and
i
was
determined
to
go
by
the
time
we
reached
the
main
fork
of
the
duchesne
our
provisions
were
about
gone
game
can
not
exist
in
the
high
mountains
during
the
coldest
part
of
the
winter
nothing
had
been
met
we
hoped
to
find
something
on
reaching
the
river
we
camped
near
some
springs
that
ran
into
the
stream
finding
places
where
the
river
was
open
we
hoped
to
catch
some
fish
for
supper
we
cast
our
hooks
but
had
no
bites
we
continued
to
fish
until
near
dusk
we
had
traveled
eight
days
without
rest
but
agreed
if
we
could
get
something
for
supper
to
lay
over
and
call
it
sabbath
we
finally
gave
up
fishing
brother
sessions
got
to
camp
a
little
ahead
of
me
i
followed
feeling
very
much
discouraged
i
thought
of
course
we
would
have
to
go
to
bed
supperless
it
was
becoming
quite
dark
and
suddenly
i
heard
a
shot
that
made
me
feel
happy
directly
another
was
fired
as
i
came
up
bradley
was
reloading
his
shot
gun
and
remarked
we
got
supper
and
breakfast
here
are
two
pine
hens
at
that
the
third
one
came
flying
along
knocked
sessions
cap
off
his
head
and
lit
on
the
ground
just
in
front
of
him
he
shot
saying
there
dinner
we
had
a
few
crumbs
of
crackers
and
a
small
piece
of
bacon
we
soon
had
a
fine
stew
of
one
of
the
chickens
giving
the
dog
his
share
the
dog
had
by
this
time
become
quite
well
trained
and
a
great
favorite
also
pulling
his
sled
with
nearly
one
hundred
pounds
load
on
it
we
laid
over
next
day
catching
several
fine
trout
we
had
not
yet
suffered
for
food
so
we
ate
heartily
knowing
that
as
long
as
we
kept
our
strength
we
were
all
right
that
it
would
be
time
to
starve
when
forced
to
it
when
we
left
camp
we
had
a
few
fish
enough
for
one
meal
and
one
small
meal
of
crumbs
and
a
few
bits
of
bacon
we
agreed
to
try
and
make
a
good
drive
down
the
river
that
day
and
not
stop
for
dinner
and
if
possible
reach
the
road
where
we
hoped
to
find
the
snow
hard
the
snow
was
now
harder
than
in
the
mountains
we
could
move
along
slowly
without
tramping
a
road
and
were
making
very
good
time
about
noon
i
became
very
hungry
and
remarked
to
sessions
that
the
man
who
works
has
a
right
to
eat
he
replied
that
what
i
think
we
halted
took
out
our
little
stock
of
food
and
ate
it
all
except
the
fish
about
the
time
we
had
fairly
started
on
we
discovered
a
mountain
sheep
on
a
high
point
of
the
mountain
sessions
grabbed
his
rifle
telling
me
to
try
and
keep
the
sled
in
motion
so
as
to
attract
its
attention
and
he
would
have
some
meat
for
supper
i
continued
tugging
at
the
sled
moving
a
few
rods
at
a
time
bradley
climbed
the
mountain
at
a
rate
of
speed
that
could
not
well
have
been
done
by
a
hungry
man
still
it
took
quite
a
while
as
it
was
a
long
way
up
i
could
see
the
sheep
but
sessions
kept
out
of
its
sight
he
had
now
got
well
up
the
mountain
i
heard
the
rifle
crack
and
saw
the
sheep
fall
i
felt
happy
again
and
moved
up
to
some
dry
cedars
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
and
had
a
fire
ready
for
a
roast
by
the
time
sessions
got
down
the
mountain
with
the
meat
after
roasting
and
eating
what
we
wanted
we
moved
on
down
to
old
fort
duchesne
now
abandoned
we
cut
up
our
meat
which
was
very
poor
being
mostly
skin
and
bone
jerked
the
flesh
which
was
but
little
boiled
the
bones
and
ate
very
heartily
next
morning
we
were
both
sick
i
took
the
dog
and
his
sled
and
went
down
to
the
government
road
a
few
miles
distant
the
traveling
was
tolerably
good
we
fed
the
most
of
the
meat
to
the
dog
as
it
seemed
to
weaken
us
to
eat
it
after
resting
one
day
we
moved
down
to
the
road
camping
near
an
old
house
we
had
hopes
of
finding
something
stored
here
that
we
could
eat
but
nothing
whatever
was
found
the
house
was
open
and
no
wood
very
near
so
we
camped
where
there
was
plenty
of
dry
timber
standing
we
were
very
weak
our
stomachs
being
out
of
condition
and
nothing
to
eat
except
the
jerked
meat
which
only
made
us
sicker
to
eat
it
it
was
an
intensely
cold
evening
we
became
chilled
and
had
strength
to
cut
down
trees
to
make
a
good
fire
there
were
a
few
dry
willows
but
they
would
only
make
a
temporary
blaze
each
of
us
tried
to
use
the
ax
but
we
were
as
weak
as
little
children
i
never
felt
so
used
up
before
i
felt
as
though
we
would
perish
i
knew
if
we
went
to
bed
in
our
exhausted
chilled
condition
we
would
be
in
danger
of
freezing
for
no
amount
of
clothing
will
warm
a
person
under
such
circumstances
but
like
the
ice
the
more
blankets
you
wrap
around
the
colder
it
keeps
some
may
doubt
this
but
when
far
enough
chilled
there
is
danger
in
going
to
bed
i
have
had
to
get
up
and
make
a
fire
more
than
once
to
get
thawed
out
our
condition
seemed
almost
hopeless
so
much
so
that
i
found
the
tears
running
down
my
cheeks
before
i
thought
what
to
do
this
weakness
made
me
a
little
angry
with
myself
at
last
i
told
bradley
to
gather
as
many
willows
as
possible
the
wind
was
blowing
almost
a
blizzard
but
we
were
in
the
timber
and
tolerably
well
protected
i
got
our
coffee
pot
ready
and
made
a
lot
of
strong
coffee
we
drank
of
it
and
ate
a
few
bites
of
the
meat
the
coffee
seemed
to
almost
intoxicate
us
giving
us
strength
we
pitched
in
like
strong
men
and
cut
down
trees
and
made
up
a
roaring
fire
got
well
warmed
up
and
went
to
bed
and
slept
soundly
next
morning
we
were
quite
feeble
but
felt
safe
as
the
traveling
was
now
of
a
different
kind
from
this
point
for
miles
to
the
agency
the
road
was
open
for
teams
in
fact
in
many
places
the
snow
was
clear
from
the
road
which
was
now
muddy
and
heavy
so
we
stored
our
sled
in
the
old
house
left
our
strapped
a
pair
of
blankets
on
the
dog
and
started
on
we
had
nothing
for
breakfast
and
a
march
of
two
days
was
before
us
we
were
so
determined
to
keep
our
pledge
not
to
complain
that
we
never
spoke
a
word
regarding
our
situation
simply
doing
what
we
had
to
and
moving
on
just
as
though
all
was
right
we
had
our
guns
but
no
game
came
in
our
way
and
we
were
too
weak
to
risk
a
step
out
of
our
direction
on
an
uncertain
hunt
we
never
spoke
of
the
thought
until
afterwards
but
our
last
hope
was
to
kill
our
dog
which
would
have
seemed
almost
like
killing
a
human
being
for
he
carried
a
heavy
pair
of
blankets
on
his
back
when
we
were
too
weak
to
carry
them
ourselves
again
our
condition
would
not
be
materially
helped
by
unpalatable
dog
meat
we
were
more
sick
from
bad
food
than
starved
our
condition
grew
worse
and
worse
each
of
us
was
attacked
with
flux
in
a
most
violent
manner
i
remember
well
of
looking
ahead
several
times
a
few
rods
and
picking
out
some
object
by
the
side
of
the
road
and
thinking
it
looked
a
more
comfortable
place
to
die
in
than
where
i
was
sessions
told
me
afterwards
his
thoughts
were
the
same
first
one
and
then
the
other
would
pass
on
a
little
way
and
stop
not
a
word
was
spoken
my
feelings
were
to
move
ahead
as
long
as
a
mite
of
strength
lasted
we
continued
on
in
this
way
until
about
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
our
progress
was
slow
we
had
fell
in
together
and
were
moving
along
at
a
snail
pace
when
sessions
stooped
down
picked
up
something
and
in
a
joyous
tone
exclaimed
here
life
and
breaking
in
two
an
ear
of
corn
handed
me
half
of
it
we
commenced
eating
i
ate
mine
cob
and
all
chewing
it
a
long
time
before
swallowing
never
before
or
since
have
i
tasted
anything
so
sweet
and
strengthening
it
seemed
to
penetrate
to
the
end
of
my
toes
we
were
strengthened
immediately
and
commenced
to
walk
at
a
regular
even
pace
in
good
traveling
time
about
the
time
we
had
finished
eating
this
i
discovered
another
ear
picked
it
up
and
divided
it
saying
here
is
more
life
our
sickness
ceased
entirely
and
we
continued
traveling
until
near
midnight
we
arrived
at
a
good
dry
camp
gave
the
last
scrap
of
meat
to
the
faithful
dog
feeling
that
we
were
good
for
next
day
tramp
food
or
no
food
it
was
a
good
long
day
travel
the
next
morning
we
left
our
blankets
hung
up
in
a
tree
measured
our
gait
and
agreed
to
keep
it
up
setting
our
time
to
arrive
at
the
station
about
sundown
at
times
i
was
tempted
to
cry
enough
halt
but
it
seemed
as
though
we
dared
not
stop
for
fear
we
could
not
get
up
steam
for
another
start
so
we
kept
up
our
gait
all
day
and
till
nine
at
night
when
we
arrived
at
the
trader
quarters
owned
by
george
basor
whom
i
was
well
acquainted
with
and
who
still
lives
in
that
region
george
started
back
and
in
a
serious
manner
asked
is
this
dan
jones
ghost
or
dan
himself
i
answered
i
am
dan
and
d
hungry
he
grasped
my
hand
laughing
and
said
he
saw
it
was
all
right
for
dan
always
came
into
camp
hungry
while
we
were
at
supper
some
of
the
boys
went
over
to
the
office
and
told
of
our
arrival
they
came
back
and
said
that
the
agent
and
clerk
declared
they
intended
to
kill
me
on
sight
i
do
not
wish
to
be
considered
a
boaster
in
truth
i
leave
many
things
untold
that
i
might
tell
only
i
despise
a
braggart
and
do
not
wish
to
appear
as
one
i
was
too
hungry
to
let
this
report
stop
my
eating
when
i
got
through
i
picked
up
my
shot
gun
putting
a
few
extra
navy
balls
into
it
and
told
the
boys
i
was
going
over
to
the
office
some
of
them
wanted
to
go
with
me
but
i
preferred
going
alone
men
often
get
the
name
of
being
brave
and
fearless
from
such
occurrences
but
in
this
case
i
will
tell
just
how
i
felt
and
what
my
reasons
were
and
i
think
many
others
feel
the
same
under
similar
circumstances
i
consider
suspense
or
uncertainty
the
most
disagreeable
condition
in
the
world
i
did
not
wish
to
be
annoyed
by
fear
or
dread
of
being
killed
and
i
deemed
it
best
to
get
that
off
my
mind
at
once
as
i
was
tired
and
wished
to
rest
again
i
wanted
freedom
to
be
at
the
agency
unmolested
then
i
did
not
much
believe
that
the
intention
was
to
kill
me
for
men
who
really
intend
to
kill
scarcely
ever
send
word
of
their
intentions
all
this
passed
in
my
mind
so
it
was
not
any
great
bravery
on
my
part
on
reaching
the
office
i
knocked
and
was
told
to
come
in
i
had
my
shot
gun
ready
their
pistols
lay
in
front
of
them
i
was
asked
what
i
wanted
i
replied
that
i
wanted
to
know
whether
it
was
to
be
war
or
peace
the
agent
answered
i
guess
it
had
better
be
peace
peace
it
is
then
i
put
my
gun
down
and
shook
hands
with
both
i
was
kindly
treated
and
accommodated
in
many
ways
by
the
agent
after
this
while
at
the
agency
i
got
a
team
from
him
to
bring
in
the
sled
and
goods
chapter
xxix
i
visit
the
indian
camp
our
big
talk
some
of
their
grievances
the
kindness
of
an
indian
in
providing
me
a
horse
the
indians
were
greatly
pleased
to
see
me
it
is
well
understood
by
all
who
are
acquainted
with
indian
character
that
they
are
undemonstrative
as
a
rule
except
when
angry
especially
the
warriors
many
of
them
said
i
was
a
strong
man
and
had
good
legs
they
admired
my
companion
saying
they
knew
him
and
knew
he
was
a
good
hunter
the
most
that
i
desired
for
a
few
days
was
to
rest
and
eat
sessions
soon
got
filled
up
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
never
would
be
able
to
satisfy
my
stomach
for
having
punished
it
so
with
the
sickly
mountain
sheep
there
was
plenty
to
eat
at
the
trader
quarters
the
agent
was
kind
giving
us
all
the
potatoes
and
milk
we
wanted
these
being
about
the
only
articles
the
trader
was
lacking
the
dog
was
in
about
the
same
fix
as
myself
he
tried
to
eat
everything
on
the
reservation
but
finally
got
satisfied
by
getting
at
a
barrel
of
tallow
one
day
and
eating
as
we
all
estimated
about
ten
pounds
reader
remember
this
was
a
large
dog
basor
the
trader
would
not
cook
for
me
he
said
a
man
that
ate
as
much
as
i
did
would
have
to
do
his
own
cooking
so
one
day
while
alone
i
made
up
my
mind
to
conquer
my
hunger
i
cooked
a
good
square
meal
for
three
of
us
waited
a
little
while
for
the
others
then
sat
down
and
ate
the
whole
of
it
i
did
not
feel
hungry
again
for
several
days
after
getting
this
difficulty
over
i
told
the
indians
i
would
visit
their
camp
and
have
a
talk
with
them
a
time
was
appointed
and
tabby
the
chief
sent
a
man
and
horse
for
me
the
camp
was
some
eight
miles
from
the
station
when
i
reached
their
camp
there
were
about
fifty
of
the
principal
men
of
the
tribe
present
captain
joe
of
thistle
valley
was
there
also
i
always
considered
him
like
some
of
our
political
white
men
not
very
reliable
i
was
informed
by
joe
that
i
could
talk
i
spoke
to
them
about
half
an
hour
telling
them
that
notwithstanding
all
the
trouble
and
war
the
good
mormons
were
still
their
friends
that
brigham
had
always
desired
peace
and
was
sorry
that
any
of
his
people
wanted
to
fight
the
indians
after
saying
what
i
thought
was
safe
for
i
knew
the
delicacy
of
the
subject
as
some
of
the
indians
had
been
killed
by
such
as
professed
to
be
mormons
and
i
was
careful
not
to
push
the
subject
too
far
in
my
first
attempt
i
desired
to
hear
tabby
talk
i
knew
he
was
much
respected
by
his
people
also
that
he
was
not
inclined
to
war
but
had
accepted
the
situation
and
let
things
run
neither
taking
an
active
part
in
killing
and
stealing
nor
making
any
great
effort
to
stop
the
war
he
was
very
sore
about
the
killing
of
his
half
brother
while
a
prisoner
i
myself
considered
this
somewhat
treacherous
on
the
part
of
those
who
did
it
capt
joe
seemed
to
think
he
must
do
all
the
talking
for
the
indians
no
one
else
spoke
joe
urged
me
to
say
more
i
told
him
i
wanted
to
hear
tabby
the
old
fellow
laid
down
as
much
as
to
say
i
will
not
take
part
in
this
the
act
nettled
me
considerably
and
i
told
joe
i
would
not
talk
unless
tabby
did
tabby
grunted
out
that
he
was
an
old
man
and
chief
that
joe
was
a
little
captain
and
young
and
was
good
enough
to
talk
to
me
this
made
me
mad
i
got
up
and
told
tabby
that
i
was
more
of
a
man
than
he
or
any
of
his
men
ever
were
that
they
had
been
born
and
raised
in
uintah
and
none
of
them
had
ever
been
brave
or
strong
enough
to
cross
the
snow
mountains
but
had
laid
there
shut
up
winter
after
winter
like
women
that
i
had
done
what
none
of
them
could
do
and
had
done
it
to
keep
my
word
with
them
that
they
had
agreed
if
i
would
be
their
friend
and
tell
washington
their
grievances
that
they
would
listen
to
me
and
make
peace
when
i
got
through
tabby
got
up
and
said
you
talk
big
for
a
boy
i
know
you
have
strong
legs
and
a
good
belly
for
i
have
seen
you
eat
but
i
want
to
know
where
your
grey
hairs
are
that
give
wisdom
you
had
better
wait
a
few
years
before
you
talk
i
really
felt
small
under
this
sarcasm
he
further
said
you
have
spoke
about
the
indians
stealing
from
the
mormons
i
can
answer
that
by
saying
some
of
the
mormon
bishops
helped
the
agents
to
steal
what
sends
us
while
some
of
brigham
bishops
steal
i
do
not
neither
does
tom
and
many
others
but
we
have
staid
at
home
and
worked
and
hunted
it
is
the
bad
indians
that
will
not
listen
to
me
that
steal
he
then
named
some
twelve
or
fourteen
present
whom
he
said
stole
from
the
mormons
and
made
the
trouble
he
continued
i
have
told
them
it
is
wrong
now
you
may
talk
to
them
and
make
them
good
if
you
can
i
am
not
bad
and
do
not
steal
so
you
do
not
need
to
talk
to
me
i
held
several
meetings
and
cultivated
on
every
opportunity
the
personal
friendship
of
the
indians
especially
the
raiders
talking
kindly
to
them
and
gaining
their
confidence
and
at
length
one
night
the
bad
indians
were
induced
to
talk
they
related
many
things
about
their
raids
each
in
turn
told
something
of
his
experience
entering
into
details
how
they
felt
and
giving
the
causes
of
their
each
taking
his
turn
in
talking
said
that
hunger
often
caused
them
to
go
on
raids
to
get
cattle
to
eat
always
making
the
statement
that
the
agents
stole
what
washington
sent
them
that
mormons
helped
the
agents
to
steal
that
the
sanpete
mormons
had
stolen
their
country
and
fenced
it
up
the
lands
that
their
fathers
had
given
them
had
been
taken
for
wheat
fields
when
they
asked
the
mormons
for
some
of
the
bread
raised
on
their
lands
and
beef
fed
on
their
grass
the
mormons
insulted
them
calling
them
dogs
and
other
bad
names
they
said
when
the
mormons
stole
big
fields
and
got
rich
other
mormons
who
were
poor
had
to
buy
the
land
from
them
they
were
not
allowed
to
steal
it
from
the
first
owners
the
same
as
the
first
mormons
stole
it
from
the
indians
i
have
often
wondered
how
these
statements
will
be
answered
they
are
still
open
i
never
could
answer
them
like
many
other
propositions
i
have
had
to
meet
while
laboring
among
the
indians
i
have
had
to
give
it
up
acknowledging
that
they
had
been
wronged
all
i
could
do
was
to
get
their
hearts
set
right
and
then
teach
them
magnanimity
some
may
jeer
at
this
idea
but
i
have
found
more
nobility
of
character
among
the
indians
than
what
is
common
among
many
whites
even
mormons
included
in
explanation
of
their
accusing
some
of
the
mormon
bishops
of
helping
to
rob
them
it
had
been
told
to
them
how
the
agents
managed
to
get
certain
ones
to
sign
false
vouchers
for
flour
and
beef
whether
this
was
true
or
not
the
indians
fully
believed
that
it
was
i
found
evidences
afterwards
that
at
least
looked
like
their
accusations
were
well
founded
all
who
are
acquainted
with
indian
character
know
that
a
trader
who
deals
liberally
with
the
natives
can
hold
a
great
influence
over
them
the
utes
were
great
traders
at
that
time
having
a
great
many
skins
and
furs
to
barter
they
urged
me
to
come
and
trade
with
them
this
could
only
be
done
by
buying
out
the
trader
and
getting
the
appointment
so
i
bought
out
the
trader
conditionally
with
the
hopes
of
getting
the
post
tradership
in
this
i
failed
the
friendship
of
the
agent
was
only
politic
for
the
time
being
his
endeavors
to
keep
me
out
of
the
situation
were
successful
mine
to
bring
about
a
permanent
peace
and
get
the
indians
better
provided
for
were
also
successful
probably
much
more
so
than
if
i
had
been
allowed
the
trader
position
after
visiting
with
the
indians
and
gaining
considerable
influence
over
them
getting
them
to
promise
peace
provided
the
mormons
would
be
friendly
again
i
commenced
preparing
for
my
return
home
the
indians
wanted
me
to
go
back
and
talk
to
the
mormons
and
see
positively
what
they
said
and
how
they
felt
especially
in
sanpete
valley
where
the
war
had
been
the
worst
they
wanted
to
be
assured
that
the
mormons
would
not
kill
them
provided
they
came
in
to
visit
and
trade
as
in
former
times
i
agreed
to
find
out
and
return
again
and
see
them
and
bring
a
few
more
things
they
wanted
there
were
two
men
john
sessions
and
david
boyce
at
the
agency
that
wished
to
come
in
with
me
we
brought
in
five
hundred
pounds
of
buckskins
this
with
our
provisions
and
bedding
made
about
seven
hundred
pounds
on
this
trip
the
snow
had
settled
and
we
moved
along
all
right
the
dog
hauled
most
of
the
time
two
hundred
pounds
we
thought
this
a
big
load
but
i
afterwards
learned
what
a
load
was
for
a
large
dog
in
justice
to
my
indian
friends
and
one
in
particular
i
will
relate
one
incident
just
before
leaving
an
indian
toquana
came
to
me
and
asked
me
if
i
did
not
want
a
horse
i
told
him
that
i
had
finished
trading
and
had
nothing
to
buy
a
horse
with
and
that
i
did
not
particularly
need
one
as
we
would
run
the
sled
out
on
wheels
until
we
struck
snow
then
we
could
haul
it
very
well
his
reply
was
i
do
not
want
to
sell
you
a
horse
you
are
a
friend
and
are
doing
hard
work
for
our
good
i
want
you
to
live
and
keep
strong
i
do
not
want
you
to
wear
out
i
know
your
legs
are
good
and
i
want
you
to
keep
them
good
to
go
over
the
deep
snow
where
a
horse
can
not
go
i
have
got
a
good
gentle
horse
that
knows
how
to
work
he
is
strong
can
go
through
snow
up
to
his
breast
you
take
him
let
him
pull
your
sled
just
as
long
as
he
possibly
can
then
maybe
you
can
find
some
place
on
the
hill
side
where
the
snow
is
not
deep
turn
him
out
and
if
he
lives
i
will
get
him
and
it
will
be
all
right
if
he
dies
he
will
die
mine
and
i
will
know
he
died
to
help
my
friend
and
that
will
be
all
right
i
do
not
want
anything
at
all
no
presents
or
anything
i
want
to
do
this
because
i
feel
like
doing
it
i
took
his
horse
worked
him
about
eighty
miles
and
then
turned
him
on
good
grass
where
there
was
but
little
snow
chapter

another
trip
to
uintah
agency
confidence
of
the
indians
my
return
to
salt
lake
city
call
on
secretary
delano
dodge
visits
the
indians
as
a
peace
commissioner
speech
of
chief
douglas
treaty
with
the
grass
valley
indians
on
my
arrival
in
salt
lake
city
and
after
disposing
of
my
furs
and
skins
i
made
arrangements
for
the
money
to
pay
the
trader
george
basor
for
his
stock
of
buckskins
amounting
to
some
two
thousand
dollars
the
arrangement
was
to
close
the
bargain
by
a
certain
date
provided
the
purchase
was
made
i
found
the
dog
so
useful
in
pulling
a
sled
that
i
determined
to
get
hold
of
some
more
large
dogs
and
train
them
to
do
this
i
would
be
delayed
a
few
days
so
i
got
david
boyce
who
had
just
come
in
with
me
to
take
ring
the
old
dog
with
a
sled
load
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
and
a
check
and
make
the
trip
alone
boyce
traveling
on
norwegian
made
the
trip
through
in
good
time
this
trip
of
boyce
i
consider
one
of
the
most
heroic
of
any
as
he
traveled
alone
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
passing
over
twenty
feet
of
snow
with
no
one
but
the
faithful
dog
for
company
on
getting
my
dogs
four
in
number
trained
with
sleds
for
each
i
took
my
son
wiley
thirteen
years
of
of
age
and
started
again
for
uintah
taking
about
four
hundred
pounds
of
goods
for
the
indians
i
was
careful
to
take
a
good
supply
of
provisions
on
this
trip
i
hired
a
young
man
from
heber
city
by
the
name
of
hickins
to
go
with
us
we
made
good
time
over
the
mountains
our
dogs
behaved
tolerably
well
as
i
had
trained
them
before
starting
boyce
who
went
through
with
the
express
found
the
horse
loaned
by
toquana
all
right
he
packed
the
goods
on
him
after
getting
to
hard
ground
went
on
to
the
agency
transacted
the
business
got
a
yoke
of
cattle
and
a
light
wagon
and
came
out
and
met
us
at
the
snow
line
so
everything
went
off
smoothly
on
this
trip
on
my
arrival
at
the
agency
i
found
it
would
be
impossible
for
me
to
get
the
trader
position
and
be
true
to
the
indians
what
i
had
started
to
do
for
them
would
make
the
agent
my
enemy
so
i
concluded
to
stick
to
the
let
it
cost
what
it
might
on
getting
the
indians
together
and
talking
to
them
we
came
to
a
full
understanding
and
agreement
by
this
time
they
had
come
to
believe
in
and
trust
me
implicitly
i
agreed
to
procure
all
the
evidence
i
could
in
regard
to
irregularities
on
the
part
of
the
agents
such
evidence
i
had
been
gathering
up
for
some
time
to
make
a
report
to
washington
in
their
behalf
and
do
all
i
could
to
get
them
their
rights
there
was
not
much
provisions
at
the
agency
at
this
time
for
the
indians
only
a
few
sacks
of
flour
i
assured
them
that
if
they
would
come
in
and
visit
the
mormons
that
they
would
be
glad
and
would
not
fight
them
but
would
treat
them
as
friends
as
was
the
custom
before
the
war
this
finally
was
agreed
upon
i
knew
that
some
move
of
importance
sufficient
to
cause
the
government
to
take
notice
had
to
be
made
so
it
was
arranged
that
all
the
indians
should
leave
the
reservation
and
refuse
to
return
until
they
were
furnished
with
supplies
and
a
better
system
of
provisioning
them
devised
they
hated
the
agent
as
he
had
acted
very
insultingly
to
some
of
them
they
urged
hard
that
i
would
send
in
evidence
of
his
and
get
him
removed
i
told
them
maybe
they
would
get
a
worse
one
but
they
insisted
that
there
was
no
danger
i
did
not
agree
with
the
idea
of
the
indians
the
present
agent
had
not
been
long
in
position
and
from
what
i
knew
and
had
heard
about
former
agents
he
was
not
nearly
so
bad
as
some
of
his
predecessors
in
fact
i
believed
him
capable
of
making
a
very
good
agent
when
once
posted
on
the
duties
of
his
office
my
interests
were
entirely
centered
on
doing
the
best
for
the
indians
i
possibly
could
also
that
the
people
would
be
relieved
from
their
depredations
the
furs
and
skins
that
i
had
bought
from
the
old
trader
amounted
to
some
twenty
odd
hundred
pounds
the
ground
was
now
bare
for
some
miles
the
snow
being
still
deep
for
about
the
same
distance
i
bought
a
wagon
and
team
from
the
trader
loaded
all
up
and
pulled
up
to
the
snow
region
where
we
turned
the
team
out
loaded
up
our
dog
sleds
and
by
making
an
average
of
three
return
trips
moved
our
whole
load
six
miles
each
day
our
dogs
were
fed
mostly
on
beaver
meat
caught
by
trapping
in
the
streams
along
the
route
on
nearing
provo
valley
i
went
ahead
to
get
teams
to
come
out
and
meet
the
dog
train
a
few
miles
from
heber
city
it
took
two
light
wagons
to
contain
our
load
we
made
the
trip
down
provo
canyon
and
camped
one
night
near
american
fork
i
had
been
from
home
longer
than
was
expected
there
were
no
means
of
communication
and
i
felt
very
anxious
to
get
home
as
i
believed
my
family
would
be
uneasy
about
me
at
that
time
the
terminus
of
the
utah
central
was
at
draperville
i
started
out
early
in
the
morning
on
foot
to
make
to
the
train
by
some
eight
miles
distant
i
had
been
working
on
snow
shoes
for
most
of
the
winter
i
was
now
on
good
dry
road
and
was
wearing
indian
moccasins
i
was
feeling
well
and
in
good
trim
so
i
had
but
little
fears
of
making
the
distance
in
time
after
traveling
a
short
distance
i
heard
a
wagon
approaching
on
looking
around
i
recognized
a
gentleman
who
had
always
professed
great
friendship
and
interest
in
my
labors
among
the
indians
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
would
see
if
he
would
ask
me
to
ride
without
my
making
the
request
he
drove
by
without
turning
his
head
i
made
up
my
mind
that
although
he
was
driving
a
nice
fine
traveling
team
to
beat
him
into
the
station
this
i
did
he
drove
quite
fast
but
i
kept
in
sight
of
him
all
the
way
passing
the
team
about
a
mile
before
reaching
the
station
as
i
went
by
he
spoke
to
me
saying
he
had
not
recognized
me
before
i
replied
that
i
was
in
a
hurry
and
could
not
stop
one
of
his
horses
suddenly
failed
causing
them
to
halt
this
friend
probably
never
passed
a
footman
afterwards
without
thinking
of
the
circumstance
the
reader
will
now
have
to
make
a
little
allowance
as
i
am
writing
entirely
from
memory
and
there
was
so
much
crowding
upon
me
at
this
time
i
will
have
to
go
ahead
and
write
as
it
comes
to
my
mind
regardless
of
dates
i
have
heretofore
been
able
to
place
incidents
in
regular
order
tolerably
well
possibly
i
may
in
writing
the
next
few
months
history
get
a
little
mixed
as
to
which
first
occurred
but
not
as
to
facts
soon
after
my
arrival
in
salt
lake
city
i
called
on
governor
woods
and
told
him
something
about
the
condition
of
affairs
at
the
uintah
agency
informing
him
that
owing
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
flour
or
other
provisions
at
the
agency
it
was
the
intention
of
the
indians
to
leave
there
woods
agreed
to
assist
me
in
bringing
the
matter
before
the
proper
department
my
intention
was
to
visit
washington
to
see
in
person
the
secretary
of
the
interior
in
behalf
of
the
utes
i
had
sufficient
evidence
to
show
cause
for
complaint
advising
and
persuading
the
indians
to
leave
the
agency
was
entirely
my
own
work
i
was
satisfied
that
nothing
would
be
done
unless
some
move
was
made
worth
noticing
i
had
as
before
stated
visited
the
people
in
sanpete
county
and
got
their
consent
for
the
indians
to
come
in
the
indians
were
now
on
the
road
and
would
soon
be
located
in
thistle
valley
where
they
had
agreed
to
stop
i
was
to
meet
them
there
as
soon
as
they
were
in
get
things
in
shape
and
then
if
necessary
go
to
washington
about
the
time
the
indians
got
in
secretary
delano
arrived
in
salt
lake
city
passing
through
on
a
visit
seeing
his
name
among
the
hotel
arrivals
i
called
to
see
him
and
made
my
business
known
he
treated
me
with
much
respect
making
many
inquiries
about
indians
and
indian
agents
in
general
admitting
that
the
government
had
more
trouble
with
them
than
any
other
officers
in
the
service
and
asked
me
what
i
thought
was
the
reason
of
this
i
said
the
wages
were
too
small
that
no
man
could
support
himself
especially
in
an
expensive
place
such
as
agents
generally
had
to
occupy
on
the
pittance
the
government
allowed
them
this
often
forced
them
into
dishonest
speculations
delano
admitted
that
my
explanations
looked
reasonable
after
listening
to
what
i
had
to
say
for
the
indians
he
said
if
i
could
bring
him
such
testimonials
from
some
of
the
government
officials
as
would
warrant
him
in
noticing
me
as
an
honorable
man
he
would
listen
to
and
cause
action
to
be
taken
on
my
report
i
told
him
about
my
conversation
with
governor
woods
and
his
seeming
interest
in
the
welfare
of
the
indians
delano
sent
for
governor
woods
in
the
meantime
i
went
to
a
prominent
lawyer
r
n
whom
i
knew
to
have
much
influence
with
the
officials
and
payed
him
a
liberal
fee
to
make
out
the
necessary
testimonial
and
get
the
needed
endorsers
this
did
not
require
much
time
i
presented
my
papers
to
secretary
delano
he
said
he
would
have
the
matter
investigated
and
advised
me
to
see
dodge
who
had
lately
been
appointed
special
agent
for
utah
and
nevada
and
report
to
him
and
inform
him
of
the
condition
of
affairs
when
i
called
on
mr
dodge
he
seemed
much
interested
and
agreed
to
go
to
sanpete
valley
and
visit
the
utes
on
their
arrival
promising
me
that
he
would
see
that
they
were
cared
for
i
agreed
to
meet
him
there
accordingly
when
the
indians
were
encamped
in
thistle
valley
not
long
after
my
arrival
in
salt
lake
city
i
went
to
fairview
where
i
met
mr
dodge
a
party
of
us
accompanied
him
to
the
indian
camp
some
fourteen
miles
distant
several
hundred
indians
were
there
this
was
quite
a
move
for
several
years
most
of
the
indians
had
been
at
war
stealing
robbing
and
killing
now
they
were
all
in
to
visit
their
old
acquaintances
as
friends
many
of
the
settlers
had
seen
their
friends
and
kindred
killed
by
these
same
indians
if
any
mishap
had
occurred
i
would
have
borne
the
blame
as
i
had
been
instrumental
in
bringing
this
move
about
on
arriving
at
the
camp
mr
dodge
seemed
a
little
lost
it
was
the
first
indian
camp
he
had
ever
visited
he
professed
great
friendship
the
indians
said
to
me
he
talks
good
but
his
eyes
have
dirt
in
them
a
number
of
the
leading
citizens
of
fairview
and
mt
pleasant
went
over
the
meeting
with
the
indians
was
friendly
each
party
really
desired
peace
mr
dodge
appointed
a
meeting
to
take
place
in
fairview
next
day
where
he
desired
to
see
all
the
chiefs
and
have
a
big
talk
with
them
there
were
some
thirty
of
the
principal
indians
came
over
douglas
of
the
white
river
utes
who
spoke
english
being
at
the
head
mr
dodge
had
employed
several
interpreters
to
assist
in
the
talk
he
wished
to
be
fully
understood
for
some
cause
he
seemed
to
rather
slight
me
as
interpreter
so
when
the
meeting
was
opened
mr
dodge
commenced
and
made
quite
a
speech
and
called
on
one
of
his
interpreters
to
explain
what
he
had
said
and
invited
the
indians
to
reply
the
speech
was
interpreted
but
the
indians
said
nothing
then
another
speech
was
made
and
another
interpreter
explained
with
the
same
results
finally
mr
dodge
was
determined
to
make
an
impression
he
began
and
told
the
indians
of
his
love
for
the
red
man
and
of
his
big
heart
that
swelled
so
large
that
all
the
ties
of
home
and
friends
could
not
hold
it
back
but
it
had
grown
in
him
till
it
had
reached
clear
out
to
the
wilds
of
the
rocky
mountains
penetrating
into
the
camps
of
the
much
abused
natives
that
he
was
here
as
their
friend
sent
here
by
washington
to
see
that
all
their
rights
were
respected
and
grievances
redressed
still
there
was
no
answer
from
the
indians
mr
dodge
was
now
almost
exhausted
the
indians
recognized
me
as
their
representative
and
were
intent
on
silence
until
i
was
noticed
finally
i
said
to
mr
dodge
with
your
permission
i
will
talk
a
little
to
the
chiefs
present
i
have
been
acting
as
their
friend
and
i
think
they
will
talk
if
i
request
them
to
he
said
he
would
like
to
hear
what
the
principal
men
had
to
say
i
told
the
indians
to
explain
to
mr
dodge
why
they
had
left
the
agency
and
what
their
desires
were
several
then
spoke
in
turn
recounting
how
they
had
been
defrauded
out
of
the
government
appropriations
that
if
they
could
have
their
rights
they
could
live
in
peace
douglas
being
the
last
speaker
did
not
use
an
interpreter
he
said
the
man
from
talks
good
and
makes
good
promises
and
i
hope
it
is
all
true
but
i
am
afraid
it
will
all
be
a
lie
pretty
soon
has
sent
to
us
a
heap
of
men
all
of
them
talk
good
when
they
first
come
but
in
two
or
three
moons
most
of
their
talk
proves
lies
some
in
two
moons
some
in
three
some
in
six
one
man
talk
was
good
for
one
snow
then
it
was
a
lie
same
as
the
others
this
man
here
now
looks
like
the
man
who
lasted
two
moons
maybe
the
talk
is
all
good
but
i
think
in
two
moons
may
be
it
will
be
all
lies
i
know
washington
means
to
be
good
to
us
his
heart
is
good
most
too
good
he
has
many
hungry
men
come
to
him
for
something
to
eat
they
have
slim
faces
and
long
beards
and
look
hungry
and
they
cry
and
tell
washington
they
have
nothing
to
eat
then
washington
gets
tired
of
their
crying
and
makes
them
agents
and
sends
them
out
here
and
they
take
all
washington
sends
us
i
do
think
this
is
right
they
ought
to
send
men
who
are
not
so
poor
and
starved
then
they
would
not
take
our
flour
and
we
would
have
plenty
this
is
douglas
speech
in
substance
mr
dodge
did
not
reply
farther
than
to
say
he
would
see
to
their
wants
from
sanpete
we
went
down
to
visit
the
indians
in
grass
valley
they
had
been
stealing
had
taken
quite
a
band
of
horses
lately
they
were
not
of
the
uintah
tribe
on
visiting
them
a
treaty
was
made
the
agent
agreeing
to
make
them
some
presents
the
indians
agreed
to
bring
back
the
horses
i
knew
very
well
that
no
treaty
would
be
considered
by
the
indians
until
the
goods
promised
were
delivered
i
told
mr
dodge
so
he
said
the
government
had
not
furnished
him
with
any
goods
neither
would
they
get
any
till
he
could
send
to
new
york
for
them
i
told
him
i
had
goods
along
with
me
that
he
could
have
some
worth
he
said
he
was
not
authorized
to
pay
more
than
new
york
prices
and
freight
i
replied
you
can
take
mine
now
and
when
you
find
what
new
york
prices
are
you
can
pay
me
he
took
my
goods
enough
to
ratify
the
treaty
the
indians
kept
their
contract
to
bring
in
the
horses
but
i
do
not
know
whether
mr
dodge
ever
learned
what
new
york
prices
were
or
not
chapter
xxxi
whisky
sold
to
the
indians
i
forbid
the
traffic
douglas
and
his
band
demand
an
order
to
get
they
threaten
to
kill
me
my
trick
on
them
for
threatening
me
mr
dodge
orders
the
indians
back
to
the
reservation
they
refuse
to
go
trouble
brewing
peaceable
settlement
during
the
time
the
indians
were
in
thistle
valley
there
were
a
number
of
persons
mean
enough
to
sell
them
whisky
this
was
a
dangerous
business
and
i
did
all
in
my
power
to
stop
it
after
returning
from
grass
valley
i
camped
near
the
indians
in
thistle
i
also
visited
the
sanpete
settlements
and
watched
the
moves
and
did
what
i
could
to
keep
peace
there
were
quite
a
number
opposed
to
the
indians
being
around
and
expressed
themselves
quite
freely
but
the
greater
portion
of
the
people
were
desirous
of
peace
the
whisky
selling
was
the
great
evil
likely
to
bring
on
trouble
at
any
time
finally
through
threatening
the
whisky
sellers
with
prosecution
i
succeeded
in
frightening
them
off
all
except
one
man
at
moroni
who
still
had
not
given
up
the
business
douglas
and
some
fifteen
others
obtained
whisky
from
this
rascal
sufficient
to
get
well
started
on
a
drunk
then
came
on
to
fairview
went
to
where
they
had
been
in
the
habit
of
getting
whisky
and
wanted
more
here
they
were
told
by
that
jones
had
stopped
him
selling
whisky
and
that
none
could
be
had
without
a
written
order
from
him
the
indians
had
just
enough
to
fire
them
up
for
more
so
they
struck
for
my
camp
twelve
miles
distant
in
full
charge
no
one
was
with
me
but
my
son
wiley
then
about
thirteen
years
of
age
soon
i
was
charged
upon
by
three
or
four
drunken
indians
demanding
of
me
that
i
should
give
them
an
order
for
whisky
i
told
them
i
would
not
one
indian
had
a
pencil
and
paper
he
offered
it
to
me
saying
you
must
now
write
or
we
will
kill
you
still
i
refused
others
were
now
arriving
soon
the
whole
crowd
was
upon
me
all
were
excited
and
just
drunk
enough
to
be
mean
i
told
my
son
to
sit
still
not
to
move
or
say
a
word
this
he
did
not
seeming
to
notice
what
was
going
on
many
times
it
looked
as
though
my
time
had
come
for
numerous
guns
were
aimed
at
me
at
different
times
seemingly
with
the
full
intention
of
pulling
the
trigger
when
one
indian
would
fail
to
shoot
another
would
crowd
in
with
his
gun
aimed
at
me
saying
i
will
shoot
if
you
do
write
many
of
them
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
tried
to
make
me
write
but
i
was
determined
that
i
would
not
finally
i
became
so
overcome
and
weary
with
the
excitement
and
effort
to
resist
their
demand
that
i
almost
became
indifferent
to
life
it
really
looked
as
though
i
might
get
shot
so
i
begged
them
to
be
still
a
minute
and
hear
me
then
if
they
wanted
to
they
could
kill
me
all
became
quiet
i
told
them
that
i
had
always
been
their
friend
and
was
now
working
for
their
good
referred
to
the
hard
trips
across
the
snow
mountains
to
do
them
good
and
that
i
would
still
like
to
live
as
i
had
not
finished
the
work
i
was
doing
for
them
and
it
was
as
their
friend
that
i
had
forbidden
anyone
selling
them
whisky
because
it
made
them
fools
and
bad
men
so
much
so
that
they
were
now
abusing
me
the
best
friend
they
had
that
i
had
agreed
with
god
to
be
their
friend
and
never
shed
any
of
their
blood
and
that
i
would
die
before
i
would
sign
the
papers
and
if
they
killed
me
god
would
not
be
their
friend
i
was
now
so
exhausted
and
sleepy
that
i
could
scarcely
keep
awake
although
it
was
so
i
told
the
indians
i
was
tired
and
would
lie
down
and
go
to
sleep
and
if
they
were
determined
to
kill
me
to
wait
till
i
was
asleep
then
put
their
guns
close
to
my
head
so
i
would
not
suffer
much
telling
them
i
asked
this
as
their
friend
i
spread
my
blankets
on
the
ground
laid
down
and
i
am
sure
it
was
not
more
than
two
minutes
till
i
was
sound
asleep
my
little
son
still
sat
silent
after
sleeping
quite
a
while
i
felt
someone
pulling
at
my
foot
on
looking
up
i
discovered
that
most
of
the
indians
were
lying
around
me
asleep
my
son
was
also
sound
asleep
the
indian
pulling
at
me
asked
me
to
get
up
and
sell
him
something
he
wanted
i
told
him
i
was
too
sick
to
get
up
he
insisted
but
i
was
determined
to
be
sick
soon
others
tried
to
rouse
me
but
i
knew
as
long
as
i
lay
in
bed
i
was
all
right
finally
all
the
indians
left
i
now
wakened
wiley
and
asked
him
about
how
the
indians
acted
when
i
went
to
sleep
he
said
that
one
after
another
came
near
and
looked
at
me
without
saying
a
word
then
they
all
laid
down
around
me
and
went
to
sleep
that
finally
he
got
sleepy
and
also
laid
down
i
concluded
to
play
them
a
little
game
for
this
for
i
knew
when
sober
the
indians
were
faithful
to
me
and
i
did
not
want
another
experience
of
this
kind
wiley
watched
and
whenever
an
indian
approached
i
would
cover
up
sick
we
had
a
lot
of
trade
but
i
was
too
sick
to
do
anything
when
they
wanted
to
know
what
ailed
me
i
told
them
my
heart
was
sick
that
it
felt
so
bad
i
could
do
nothing
this
continued
day
after
day
till
the
indians
became
really
uneasy
for
fear
i
would
die
finally
tabby
and
others
came
and
made
me
presents
of
buckskins
and
beavers
and
begged
me
to
forgive
the
indians
who
had
threatened
me
saying
that
if
i
would
live
and
be
their
friend
they
never
would
say
whisky
to
me
again
and
if
they
ever
got
drunk
they
would
go
away
to
the
mountains
and
not
come
near
me
i
finally
got
well
much
to
their
joy
to
show
the
danger
i
was
in
a
few
days
after
this
affair
two
indians
were
killed
in
a
drunken
row
among
themselves
soon
after
returning
to
the
city
mr
dodge
seemed
to
change
his
tactics
he
informed
me
that
it
was
his
intention
to
order
the
indians
back
to
the
reservation
at
once
and
that
he
would
make
me
no
promises
whatever
i
told
him
the
indians
expected
something
as
there
was
nothing
at
the
reservation
when
they
left
except
a
little
flour
the
most
of
the
indians
from
uintah
were
now
camped
near
nephi
mr
dodge
went
out
there
and
preemptorily
ordered
them
back
to
the
agency
tabby
told
him
they
would
not
go
back
until
there
was
something
sent
with
them
as
they
would
as
soon
die
fighting
as
to
starve
the
indians
had
agreed
with
me
that
they
would
not
fight
but
would
hold
out
as
long
as
they
could
but
would
give
up
and
go
back
if
pressed
i
had
been
forbidden
to
go
among
the
indians
any
more
under
penalty
of
arrest
for
inducing
the
indians
to
leave
the
reservation
i
began
to
feel
a
little
uneasy
when
i
heard
now
tabby
had
talked
that
he
had
forgotten
his
promise
to
me
i
tried
to
get
permission
to
go
and
see
the
indians
offering
to
guarantee
that
they
would
go
back
peaceably
if
i
could
have
a
talk
with
them
but
was
still
refused
the
privilege
the
condition
of
affairs
was
telegraphed
to
washington
much
excitement
prevailed
many
persons
blamed
me
for
getting
the
indians
into
the
settlements
and
some
favored
their
being
whipped
back
a
good
many
sensational
stories
came
from
sanpete
the
indians
being
accused
of
many
things
they
did
not
do
the
telegraph
operator
of
one
of
the
settlements
was
knocked
in
the
head
by
some
one
this
was
laid
to
the
indians
it
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
white
man
that
committed
the
deed
i
was
working
continually
to
counteract
these
stories
for
i
had
faith
in
the
indians
the
only
thing
i
dreaded
was
the
selling
of
whisky
to
the
indians
by
some
of
the
settlers
a
drunken
indian
is
dangerous
under
any
circumstances
finally
a
commission
arrived
from
washington
to
inquire
into
the
affair
i
had
already
offered
some
affidavits
i
had
to
mr
dodge
to
prove
some
things
against
the
management
of
the
agent
at
uintah
but
he
had
not
taken
them
from
me
mr
dodge
fully
expected
that
i
would
offer
these
in
evidence
before
the
commission
but
i
had
become
convinced
that
the
agent
was
a
better
man
than
the
one
who
had
been
appointed
to
superintend
affairs
so
i
told
mr
dodge
that
i
had
concluded
to
say
nothing
more
about
the
agent
he
flew
into
a
terrible
rage
and
said
i
would
have
to
go
ahead
that
i
could
not
back
out
as
he
had
made
a
contract
with
a
popper
for
several
hundred
beef
cattle
that
were
then
being
sent
to
the
agency
for
the
indians
and
that
unless
the
agent
was
prosecuted
and
turned
out
the
government
would
not
sustain
him
in
what
he
had
done
and
that
if
i
did
not
go
ahead
i
would
be
prosecuted
for
libel
i
asked
him
what
he
would
make
out
of
it
and
told
him
if
i
had
said
anything
against
the
agent
i
would
apologize
for
it
and
that
i
did
not
intend
to
interfere
in
the
agent
business
any
more
i
had
learned
enough
to
know
that
the
indians
would
get
the
cattle
but
charles
popper
had
quite
a
time
getting
his
pay
for
them
but
finally
did
the
superintendent
was
now
down
on
me
fully
and
completely
so
when
the
commission
met
in
his
office
general
morrow
being
present
i
was
watching
all
the
moves
continually
i
walked
in
mr
dodge
ordered
me
out
i
replied
that
i
was
an
interested
party
that
i
represented
the
indians
and
did
not
intend
to
go
out
that
there
was
a
sign
outside
the
door
which
allowed
me
as
an
american
citizen
to
walk
in
and
that
my
business
was
such
as
warranted
my
coming
in
general
morrow
said
he
would
like
to
have
me
stay
so
permission
was
given
me
to
remain
the
question
being
considered
was
whether
the
indians
should
be
induced
to
return
to
the
reservation
by
telling
them
they
were
to
have
plenty
of
provisions
or
whether
an
order
should
be
given
the
military
commander
to
force
them
back
with
arms
without
any
promise
being
made
them
i
made
the
best
fight
i
could
in
behalf
of
the
indians
but
i
said
nothing
against
the
agent
at
the
reservation
dodge
could
not
as
he
had
no
evidence
in
his
possession
so
the
agent
was
not
brought
into
question
mr
dodge
was
very
angry
and
desired
war
and
worked
until
he
won
getting
an
order
issued
to
general
morrow
to
take
his
troops
and
drive
the
indians
back
now
some
might
think
i
had
done
all
i
could
but
i
was
determined
not
to
give
up
so
on
going
out
into
the
street
i
asked
general
morrow
if
i
could
talk
to
him
he
said
no
i
have
no
time
i
have
to
go
and
whip
these
d
indians
back
to
the
reservation
still
i
did
not
give
up
i
felt
almost
desperate
for
if
the
indians
had
resisted
it
would
have
reflected
on
me
for
getting
them
away
from
the
agency
my
intention
was
if
necessary
to
go
and
see
them
and
take
the
consequences
general
morrow
and
some
other
officers
mounted
their
horses
and
started
for
camp
he
was
hardly
in
his
quarters
before
i
was
there
i
had
been
to
his
house
before
and
been
introduced
to
his
wife
when
i
called
the
general
treated
me
pleasantly
and
asked
what
he
could
do
for
me
i
told
him
i
had
called
to
see
his
wife
that
i
wanted
to
get
her
to
help
me
to
try
and
persuade
him
not
to
make
war
on
the
indians
if
it
could
possibly
be
avoided
i
believe
general
morrow
thought
me
a
little
crazy
finally
he
promised
me
that
he
would
not
fire
a
gun
until
i
had
the
privilege
of
going
and
talking
to
the
indians
i
now
felt
satisfied
for
i
knew
that
they
would
listen
to
me
as
they
had
pledged
themselves
to
take
my
advice
it
was
not
the
intention
of
mr
dodge
to
let
the
indians
know
that
anything
would
be
sent
immediately
to
the
agency
but
as
i
had
learned
about
the
beef
cattle
i
intended
informing
them
i
went
and
talked
with
huntington
he
was
pretty
well
posted
on
what
i
was
doing
and
was
in
sympathy
with
me
he
was
a
good
interpreter
and
was
not
known
by
mr
dodge
dimick
went
out
and
explained
my
situation
to
the
indians
that
i
had
been
forbidden
by
mr
dodge
to
visit
them
that
i
did
not
want
them
to
resist
but
to
listen
to
general
morrow
and
go
back
to
the
agency
peaceably
the
indians
met
at
springville
where
general
morrow
listened
to
them
i
was
not
present
but
kept
track
of
all
the
moves
the
indians
were
perfectly
willing
now
to
return
and
made
no
offer
of
resistance
several
hundred
sacks
of
flour
as
well
as
the
beef
cattle
mentioned
were
sent
out
the
indians
were
now
happy
so
far
my
aims
were
accomplished
peace
had
been
made
and
confirmed
between
the
white
people
and
hostile
utes
government
had
taken
notice
of
their
condition
and
provisions
had
been
sent
all
this
had
been
done
on
the
stir
i
had
been
the
means
of
making
the
agent
at
uintah
was
not
consulted
and
nothing
had
been
done
in
his
name
or
by
his
authority
neither
was
he
in
any
way
implicated
as
not
one
word
of
testimony
stood
against
him
so
he
ignored
the
cattle
purchased
came
in
and
bought
supplies
and
went
on
as
usual
with
his
agency
business
mr
dodge
was
censured
and
dismissed
from
office
for
getting
up
all
the
trouble
there
were
several
attempts
made
to
get
some
papers
i
had
in
my
possession
but
i
kept
them
for
future
use
if
needed
i
never
have
heard
of
any
material
trouble
between
the
mormons
and
utes
since
that
time
the
agent
took
hold
in
good
shape
and
the
indians
afterward
spoke
well
of
him
during
this
whole
business
i
worked
without
counsel
or
advice
from
any
one
except
the
advice
first
given
by
smith
i
acted
as
a
trader
most
of
the
time
but
my
main
business
was
to
establish
peace
it
cost
considerable
time
and
money
and
when
i
got
through
there
was
a
debt
of
some
against
me
at
i
brother
brigham
ordered
the
account
sent
to
him
for
settlement
several
years
after
this
whilst
living
in
arizona
i
received
a
letter
from
a
former
friend
of
the
agent
asking
me
for
the
papers
i
had
saying
that
with
them
and
what
they
had
they
thought
they
could
make
a
case
against
this
same
agent
i
replied
to
them
that
if
they
had
to
go
back
so
far
for
evidence
it
was
clear
to
me
that
the
agent
was
doing
pretty
well
that
i
had
not
heard
of
the
indians
complaining
of
late
years
and
that
i
had
no
papers
for
them
so
long
as
the
indians
were
satisfied
i
cared
nothing
for
disappointed
speculators
chapter
xxxii
the
killing
of
an
indian
near
fairview
his
friends
visit
me
i
advise
them
to
keep
the
peace
and
they
do
so
after
the
indian
troubles
were
settled
i
was
advised
to
move
to
sanpete
valley
to
try
and
keep
an
influence
for
peace
with
the
whites
as
well
as
the
utes
the
authorities
of
sanpete
county
together
with
the
greater
portion
of
the
people
approved
of
my
labors
and
were
glad
that
peace
was
now
made
whilst
some
of
the
more
captious
found
fault
and
used
their
influence
to
bring
about
a
collision
hoping
thereby
to
get
the
indians
killed
by
setting
the
troops
upon
them
i
believed
then
and
still
do
that
some
things
laid
to
the
indians
was
the
work
of
white
men
and
designed
for
effect
in
justice
to
the
indian
side
of
the
question
i
will
say
that
most
of
the
annoyance
was
done
by
drunken
indians
a
party
of
which
attacked
the
herd
boys
coming
into
fairview
killing
one
of
them
this
was
supposed
to
be
a
personal
affair
as
these
same
indians
passed
other
boys
about
the
same
time
without
molesting
them
some
time
after
peace
had
been
considered
fully
established
an
indian
was
murdered
in
cold
blood
by
a
party
of
whites
going
out
after
wood
from
fairview
the
body
was
covered
up
but
was
finally
discovered
by
the
indians
the
killing
was
cowardly
in
the
extreme
and
more
treacherous
than
anything
i
ever
remember
done
by
the
indians
the
exact
number
i
have
forgotten
but
some
six
or
eight
young
men
were
going
out
to
the
cedars
for
wood
they
met
a
lone
indian
coming
in
from
thistle
valley
on
his
way
to
fairview
at
that
time
this
was
nothing
unusual
the
wood
haulers
spoke
friendly
to
the
indian
and
asked
him
to
go
with
them
into
the
cedars
and
as
soon
as
they
loaded
up
he
could
ride
into
town
with
them
the
indian
had
no
suspicion
of
anything
wrong
and
i
do
not
believe
the
wood
haulers
at
first
thought
of
killing
him
he
went
out
into
the
cedars
staying
around
while
the
loading
was
going
on
after
a
while
someone
suggested
that
it
would
be
a
good
chance
to
kill
the
d
indian
and
hide
him
away
others
assented
so
much
was
said
that
the
indian
who
understood
some
of
their
talk
became
uneasy
and
started
to
leave
at
this
one
of
the
party
shot
him
all
being
armed
with
pistols
now
took
part
and
as
the
indian
ran
the
whole
party
fired
at
and
succeeded
in
killing
him
they
buried
him
among
the
cedars
covering
him
mainly
with
brush
when
the
indians
discovered
his
body
they
came
to
me
feeling
very
badly
the
indians
really
desired
peace
the
murdered
indian
in
fact
belonged
to
a
band
that
never
had
been
of
the
worst
i
was
now
living
in
fairview
i
was
greatly
mortified
and
scarcely
knew
how
to
answer
for
i
was
aware
it
would
be
natural
for
the
indians
to
seek
blood
for
blood
and
it
was
a
little
surprise
to
me
that
they
stopped
to
consider
but
as
they
had
come
to
me
i
took
courage
and
commenced
talking
reciting
a
great
deal
of
the
indian
history
from
the
earliest
settling
of
utah
acknowledging
that
the
first
blood
shed
was
that
of
an
indian
on
the
provo
bottom
also
admitting
that
they
had
often
been
wronged
referred
to
the
hard
labor
that
i
had
done
in
crossing
the
snow
mountains
and
how
i
had
got
them
beef
and
flour
and
made
good
peace
between
them
and
the
mormons
and
how
true
the
indians
had
been
to
me
and
how
sick
my
heart
now
was
that
this
had
occurred
i
was
not
acting
for
it
was
a
cruel
thing
besides
being
so
senseless
finally
when
i
had
got
the
indians
to
feel
that
i
fully
sympathized
with
them
i
said
to
them
some
one
has
to
be
the
last
or
this
killing
will
never
cease
now
as
some
persons
without
cause
have
killed
one
of
your
people
if
you
kill
a
mormon
to
pay
for
it
wo
some
bad
mormon
kill
another
indian
then
when
am
i
ever
to
see
good
peace
if
you
will
pass
this
by
and
let
this
be
the
last
i
do
believe
there
will
be
any
more
killing
for
when
the
mormons
know
that
an
indian
was
last
killed
they
will
be
ashamed
and
the
men
who
killed
your
friend
will
be
despised
by
all
good
people
at
last
these
indians
consented
and
agreed
not
to
kill
anyone
in
retaliation
i
have
never
heard
of
their
breaking
this
promise
i
would
ask
those
who
are
so
down
on
the
treacherous
indians
to
think
of
this
my
labors
with
the
utes
were
now
almost
ended
i
had
already
been
asked
to
get
ready
to
go
to
mexico
on
a
mission
an
account
of
which
will
be
given
in
subsequent

mob
dispersed
captain
burt
and
his
men
make
some
sore
heads
one
item
of
home
history
that
i
took
a
small
part
in
i
will
mention
at
the
august
election
of
city
officers
of
there
was
an
attempt
made
by
the
marshal
to
control
the
polls
this
was
disputed
by
the
municipal
officers
maxwell
the
marshal
had
a
large
number
of
deputies
sworn
in
milton
orr
was
at
that
time
the
regular
deputy
and
took
the
active
control
of
the
special
deputies
this
election
occurred
soon
after
the
passage
of
the
poland
bill
the
liberals
were
on
their
high
heels
and
believed
that
they
had
now
the
right
and
power
to
put
down
mormon
rule
in
salt
lake
city
during
the
day
there
was
continued
contention
who
should
act
as
police
or
protectors
of
the
polls
the
marshals
interfered
continually
and
when
the
police
attempted
to
do
their
duty
they
were
arrested
by
the
deputies
and
taken
before
the
commissioner
and
put
under
bonds
several
times
during
the
day
the
spirit
of
lawlessness
ran
so
high
that
a
collision
seemed
inevitable
the
police
acted
with
great
coolness
and
forbearance
only
working
to
keep
the
polls
unobstructed
but
making
no
resistance
when
insulted
or
arrested
neither
acting
against
the
rioters
so
long
as
they
kept
clear
of
the
polls
many
times
during
the
day
men
would
yell
out
that
the
mormons
had
run
this
country
as
long
as
they
could
that
their
day
was
done
boasting
swearing
and
defying
the
police
to
help
themselves
this
was
immediately
in
front
of
the
city
hall
some
of
the
mob
even
crowding
into
the
hallway
late
in
the
afternoon
the
mob
became
so
aggressive
and
the
polls
so
obstructed
that
people
wishing
to
vote
could
not
get
in
the
marshals
headed
this
obstruction
the
police
seemingly
had
no
power
to
keep
order
captain
burt
sent
word
to
mayor
wells
asking
for
instructions
mayor
wells
soon
appeared
on
the
ground
and
managed
to
work
his
way
through
the
crowd
and
get
into
the
door
of
the
polling
room
the
regular
police
were
mostly
on
the
inside
of
the
city
hall
at
that
time
the
mayor
commanded
the
crowd
to
disperse
and
leave
the
entrance
clear
this
he
uttered
by
authority
of
his
office
there
were
possibly
two
hundred
persons
in
the
crowd
the
room
was
full
and
the
doors
completely
blocked
and
the
sidewalk
crowded
many
were
in
the
street
and
more
coming
cursing
and
yelling
some
of
the
leaders
now
more
or
less
intoxicated
when
the
order
was
given
to
disperse
instead
of
obeying
made
an
attack
on
the
mayor
they
were
led
by
milton
orr
who
seized
hold
of
wells
and
attempted
to
drag
him
from
his
position
mayor
wells
resisted
this
move
several
others
now
caught
hold
of
him
tearing
his
clothes
i
was
just
at
the
outer
side
of
the
sidewalk
in
company
with
george
crismon
as
we
saw
this
violent
move
against
the
mayor
we
started
through
the
crowd
george
taking
the
lead
and
i
always
remembered
his
expertness
in
opening
a
way
for
we
were
soon
on
hand
the
noise
was
so
terrific
that
i
had
to
put
my
mouth
close
to
wells
ear
i
asked
him
which
way
he
wished
to
go
the
jam
was
on
both
sides
of
him
i
naturally
supposed
he
wanted
to
get
away
for
the
mob
seemed
to
want
to
rend
him
in
pieces
and
were
doing
their
best
to
accomplish
it
brother
wells
answered
i
do
not
want
to
go
either
way
i
shall
stay
here
if
i
can
you
help
me
to
keep
my
place
brother
crismon
did
all
he
could
to
keep
the
mob
off
i
caught
brother
wells
around
the
waist
and
held
him
against
those
pulling
at
him
his
clothes
were
badly
torn
in
the
scuffle
while
this
was
going
on
brother
andrew
smith
of
the
police
force
managed
to
get
near
us
from
the
inside
he
called
to
me
to
push
brother
wells
to
him
i
said
he
do
want
to
come
in
brother
smith
said
never
mind
at
the
same
time
reaching
and
getting
hold
of
brother
wells
telling
me
to
shove
him
in
this
we
did
i
always
believed
that
mayor
wells
would
have
died
before
he
would
have
given
way
to
the
mob
of
his
own
free
will
as
the
mayor
went
in
the
door
was
shut
and
i
was
crowded
outside
with
the
mob
i
now
felt
quite
small
jammed
into
the
doorway
all
alone
with
the
mob
i
could
see
no
friend
near
me
so
i
kept
very
quiet
soon
mayor
wells
appeared
on
the
balcony
of
the
court
house
he
looked
rather
delapidated
but
in
a
clear
steady
voice
commanded
the
rioters
to
disperse
at
this
they
only
shouted
the
louder
cursing
and
defying
his
authority
he
then
turned
to
captain
burt
and
said
in
substance
captain
burt
disperse
this
mob
and
clear
the
of
obstruction
the
mob
had
given
way
from
just
in
front
of
the
hall
door
as
the
balcony
was
immediately
over
it
and
those
under
the
balcony
had
crowded
out
so
as
to
get
a
view
of
the
mayor
in
a
moment
after
the
order
was
given
captain
burt
stepped
out
onto
the
in
front
of
the
hall
door
followed
by
a
few
regular
police
addressing
the
crowd
immediately
in
front
of
the
polling
room
he
commanded
them
to
disperse
instead
of
obeying
the
order
the
mob
with
a
howl
of
defiance
rushed
at
the
captain
who
stood
with
his
arms
folded
i
was
looking
from
a
slight
elevation
being
on
the
doorstep
and
powerless
to
do
anything
but
watch
so
that
what
i
am
writing
is
just
as
i
saw
it
as
the
mob
rushed
at
captain
burt
he
let
drive
with
his
police
club
instantly
others
of
the
police
pitched
in
i
have
seen
a
good
many
but
men
fell
as
fast
for
a
short
time
as
i
ever
saw
them
most
of
them
were
marshals
the
police
were
making
a
clearing
toward
the
door
where
i
was
jammed
in
the
mob
almost
instantly
gave
way
they
were
so
taken
by
surprise
at
seeing
their
leaders
falling
that
many
who
were
seemingly
brave
as
lions
a
minute
before
took
to
their
heels
and
ran
away
during
all
this
not
a
shot
was
fired
so
rapid
and
thorough
was
the
work
of
the
police
that
i
was
a
little
afraid
of
getting
hit
myself
and
called
out
to
capt
burt
to
set
up
one
fellow
that
was
knocked
down
fell
against
me
as
i
was
getting
out
all
the
police
were
arrested
and
brought
to
trial
before
the
commissioners
but
were
cleared
there
were
many
sore
heads
but
no
one
killed
the
man
name
who
did
the
hardest
hitting
that
day
never
came
up
and
without
his
permission
i
will
not
mention
it
sometimes
when
i
see
the
saints
insulted
accused
and
put
upon
by
their
enemies
as
they
now
are
in
the
year
i
think
of
the
good
old
days
when
we
did
not
bear
as
we
do
today
especially
when
it
is
put
forth
as
though
we
are
cowed
and
dare
not
say
our
souls
are
our
own
often
when
noticing
some
of
the
young
mormons
of
today
who
are
toadying
to
the
gentiles
and
listening
to
their
flattery
i
can
not
help
but
contrast
their
dudish
build
their
supercilious
looks
their
effort
to
ape
the
infidelity
of
the
day
with
the
sturdy
faithful
boys
who
went
forth
in
the
defence
of
their
fathers
in
the
days
of
echo
canyon
and
many
other
duties
of
the
early
days
now
why
is
this
there
is
too
much
luxury
indolence
and
false
education
many
suppose
that
education
consists
in
conjugating
verbs
my
grammar
says
man
is
a
verb
that
is
man
is
made
to
do
and
grammar
says
a
verb
is
a
word
to
do
hence
man
should
be
a
verb
and
not
a
worthless
noun
a
name
of
a
thing

young

brother
brizzee
and
myself
to
prepare
for
a
mission
to
mexico
mileton
trejo
joins
the
church
his
remarkable
conversion
i
report
to
president
young
that
i
am
ready
one
hundred
pages
of
the
book
of
mormon
translated
into
spanish
and
printed
according
to
the
request
made
by
president
young
i
bought
a
lot
and
had
a
good
comfortable
house
built
in
fairview
sanpete
expecting
to
make
that
my
future
home
the
house
was
not
yet
complete
when
i
was
called
upon
by
henry
brizzee
about
june
who
told
me
that
president
young
wished
to
see
him
and
me
at
his
office
to
talk
with
us
about
a
mission
to
mexico
saying
that
president
young
understood
that
we
spoke
the
spanish
language
i
had
expected
this
call
to
come
some
time
i
had
both
desired
and
dreaded
the
mission
my
desire
was
from
a
sense
of
duty
my
dread
was
owing
to
the
power
of
catholicism
that
i
had
seen
prevail
in
that
land
while
living
there
from
to
at
that
time
no
man
dared
pass
in
front
of
a
church
without
raising
his
hat
anyone
doing
so
was
most
sure
to
be
pelted
with
stones
with
a
possibility
of
having
his
head
broken
a
priest
passing
along
the
street
demanded
the
uncovering
of
the
head
by
all
who
met
him
a
person
life
was
in
danger
unless
acting
promptly
in
conformity
with
all
these
customs
to
offer
a
word
against
their
religion
would
be
almost
certain
death
that
the
country
had
been
revolutionized
and
religious
freedom
declared
i
had
not
learned
i
only
remembered
what
i
had
seen
i
felt
a
dread
that
tried
me
severely
while
on
my
way
to
the
office
but
before
arriving
i
had
formed
the
resolution
to
face
the
music
my
reflections
were
this
mission
has
to
be
commenced
by
someone
and
if
it
is
necessary
for
the
extreme
sacrifice
to
be
made
just
as
well
to
be
me
as
anyone
else
on
meeting
president
young
he
told
us
that
the
time
had
come
to
prepare
for
the
introduction
of
the
gospel
into
mexico
that
there
were
millions
of
the
descendants
of
nephi
in
the
land
and
that
we
were
under
obligations
to
visit
them
asked
us
if
we
were
willing
to
prepare
for
a
mission
we
told
him
we
were
nothing
very
definite
was
arranged
at
the
time
brother
young
said
he
would
like
to
have
some
extracts
from
the
book
of
mormon
translated
to
send
to
the
people
of
mexico
advised
us
to
get
our
private
affairs
arranged
also
to
study
up
our
spanish
and
prepare
ourselves
for
translating
and
report
to
him
and
when
the
proper
time
came
and
all
was
ready
he
would
let
us
know
some
suggestion
was
made
about
visiting
the
city
of
mexico
as
travelers
and
feel
our
way
among
the
people
brother
brizzee
and
i
visited
together
often
and
talked
about
the
work
before
us
we
began
to
study
and
prepare
for
translating
my
own
feelings
were
that
it
would
require
considerable
study
although
i
understood
spanish
quite
well
still
to
translate
for
publication
required
a
more
thorough
scholarship
than
either
of
us
possessed
i
often
thought
how
good
it
would
be
to
have
a
native
spaniard
to
help
us
some
few
months
after
the
notice
to
get
ready
brother
brizzee
called
at
my
house
accompanied
by
a
stranger
whom
he
introduced
as
mileton
trejo
a
spanish
gentleman
from
the
philippine
islands
and
was
an
author
and
a
traveler
after
conversing
for
some
time
with
the
gentleman
i
became
hopeful
that
he
was
the
one
needed
to
assist
in
the
translation
which
afterwards
proved
to
be
the
case
senor
trejo
told
me
that
he
had
been
induced
to
come
and
visit
the
mormon
people
partly
through
a
dream
his
account
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
was
that
while
discussing
religion
with
a
brother
officer
of
the
spanish
army
when
stationed
on
the
philippine
islands
he
remarked
that
he
believed
the
scriptures
literally
that
he
did
not
think
anyone
had
the
right
to
privately
interpret
or
change
them
his
comrade
told
him
he
would
have
to
go
and
join
the
mormons
who
lived
in
the
interior
of
america
that
he
had
learned
about
them
from
his
wife
who
was
an
english
lady
she
having
heard
about
the
mormons
and
their
doctrines
in
england
this
caused
senor
trejo
to
reflect
and
study
about
the
people
so
much
so
that
he
made
it
a
subject
of
prayer
finally
he
dreamed
that
if
he
would
go
and
see
the
mormons
he
would
be
satisfied
accordingly
he
sold
out
all
his
interests
in
the
islands
together
with
his
commission
bade
farewell
to
his
people
and
friends
and
came
to
this
country
a
stranger
not
knowing
anyone
or
enough
of
the
spoken
english
to
ask
for
a
drink
of
water
unfortunately
he
was
introduced
to
president
young
by
a
party
that
did
not
stand
very
high
in
the
estimation
of
brother
young
i
have
forgotten
the
name
of
the
one
introducing
him
this
had
rather
an
unfavorable
effect
upon
president
young
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
gave
him
his
confidence
trejo
never
resented
the
suspicion
only
said
he
will
know
me
some
day
brother
brizzee
took
trejo
home
with
him
to
live
he
commenced
studying
hard
reading
and
translating
the
voice
of
warning
the
best
he
could
he
acquired
very
rapidly
an
understanding
of
the
english
language
and
being
a
graduate
of
the
highest
schools
in
madrid
as
soon
as
he
got
a
clear
understanding
of
the
text
he
could
write
the
same
in
spanish
his
native
tongue
here
i
wish
to
correct
an
error
that
exists
in
the
minds
of
a
great
many
who
suppose
that
spanish
is
not
the
language
of
mexico
pure
spanish
is
the
language
of
mexico
just
the
same
as
pure
english
is
the
language
of
the
united
states
just
as
the
uneducated
speak
bad
english
just
so
the
uneducated
mexican
speaks
bad
spanish
anyone
learning
spanish
correctly
will
scarce
perceive
the
difference
when
talking
to
a
native
spaniard
a
mexican
or
a
californian
senor
trejo
soon
became
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
gospel
and
was
baptized
by
brother
brizzee
after
qualifying
himself
somewhat
he
commenced
on
the
book
of
mormon
at
our
earnest
solicitation
my
house
being
completed
i
moved
my
family
to
fairview
sanpete
county
brother
trejo
expressed
a
desire
to
be
with
me
he
said
i
understood
the
written
language
somewhat
better
than
brother
brizzee
brother
brizzee
had
associated
more
with
the
people
than
i
had
and
talked
quite
fluently
and
understood
spanish
very
well
but
had
not
studied
the
written
word
so
much
as
i
had
it
was
arranged
with
good
feelings
all
around
seemingly
that
as
soon
as
i
was
settled
at
home
that
trejo
would
live
with
me
and
we
would
work
together
translating
when
brother
trejo
came
i
rented
an
office
for
him
where
he
would
be
undisturbed
through
the
day
in
the
evenings
we
would
read
and
correct
together
in
the
spring
brother
returned
to
the
city
i
began
to
feel
like
reporting
to
president
young
for
we
had
everything
ready
as
it
seemed
to
me
to
do
something
with
this
before
me
i
came
down
to
salt
lake
city
met
brother
brizzee
and
told
him
how
i
felt
his
answer
was
that
he
was
sick
of
the
whole
business
that
he
had
been
up
to
the
office
to
see
prest
young
and
could
not
get
a
hearing
at
this
time
prest
young
was
much
harassed
by
lawsuits
of
various
kinds
i
felt
disappointed
at
the
answer
and
asked
brother
brizzee
if
we
had
not
better
keep
on
and
do
all
we
could
and
probably
brother
brigham
would
know
when
we
were
ready
but
i
got
no
promise
from
him
i
told
him
i
intended
to
keep
to
work
as
long
as
i
saw
anything
to
do
and
when
i
felt
fully
ready
i
would
report
i
concluded
to
remain
in
the
city
for
a
while
so
as
to
be
near
trejo
to
encourage
and
help
him
he
had
commenced
to
carefully
rewrite
the
whole
manuscript
of
the
book
of
mormon
having
translated
it
entirely
he
had
improved
so
that
by
this
time
his
understanding
of
english
was
pretty
good
he
seemed
thoroughly
interested
in
the
work
he
had
now
expended
what
money
he
had
brought
to
the
country
with
him
i
shared
what
money
i
earned
with
him
and
kept
him
going
the
best
i
could
until
some
time
in
june
when
he
came
to
me
and
said
he
would
have
to
quit
as
he
could
not
live
longer
without
an
income
of
some
kind
and
he
did
not
want
to
accept
of
me
as
he
knew
i
was
not
able
to
spare
him
means
to
live
on
this
confirmed
me
in
the
thought
that
the
time
had
come
to
report
to
brother
brigham
so
i
told
brother
platt
the
man
i
was
working
for
that
i
was
now
going
to
see
prest
young
or
with
him
till
i
did
see
him
and
report
i
went
up
town
and
saw
brother
brigham
going
into
the
old
constitution
building
followed
and
spoke
to
him
he
asked
what
are
you
doing
i
am
hunting
you
i
replied
well
what
do
you
want
i
want
to
report
to
you
you
told
me
to
come
when
i
was
ready
i
am
now
ready
all
right
go
up
to
the
office
i
will
be
there
right
away
when
brother
brigham
came
in
he
asked
what
i
had
done
i
told
him
just
about
what
had
been
done
and
explained
trejo
situation
brother
young
had
never
heard
a
word
about
his
labors
asked
if
i
could
vouch
for
him
i
told
him
i
could
vouch
for
the
work
he
was
doing
that
it
was
good
and
getting
to
be
correct
brother
young
was
somewhat
surprised
and
very
much
pleased
he
asked
me
what
henry
brizzee
was
doing
i
replied
that
i
had
made
my
own
report
and
preferred
that
brother
brizzee
would
do
the
same
brother
young
said
he
intended
to
release
brother
brizzee
from
the
call
for
reasons
that
were
sufficient
and
said
that
he
would
have
him
notified
accordingly
brother
brigham
advised
me
to
have
printed
about
pages
of
selections
from
the
book
of
mormon
and
get
them
ready
to
take
to
mexico
and
be
ready
to
start
about
the
of
september
remarking
that
the
church
funds
were
low
at
the
time
i
told
him
i
could
soon
raise
the
money
on
subscription
if
so
authorized
accordingly
i
received
the
following
letter
salt
lake
city
june
whom
it
may
concern
elder
daniel
jones
the
bearer
of
these
lines
is
hereby
authorized
to
solicit
and
receive
subscriptions
to
be
applied
toward
the
support
of
brother
gonzales
while
he
is
translating
the
book
of
mormon
into
the
spanish
language
and
such
other
church
publications
as
it
may
be
found
advisable
from
time
to
time
to
translate
into
that
language
as
brother
gonzales
labors
as
above
mentioned
promise
to
be
productive
of
much
good
it
is
hoped
that
the
saints
so
far
as
able
and
willing
will
aid
toward
his
comfortable
sustenance
while
translating
and
also
to
defray
the
cost
of
publishing
his
translations
that
are
desired
to
be
done
by
november
next
brigham
young
president
young
handed
me
a
blank
book
saying
take
this
get
what
subscriptions
you
can
and
what
is
lacking
i

saying
take
this
go
home
and
get
a
few
days
rest
read
the
book
and
when
you
feel
impressed
to
do
so
mark
the
places
and
they
will
be
the
proper
selections
for
you
have
the
spirit
of
this
mission
and
you
will
be
directed
aright
on
arriving
at
home
in
sanpete
county
i
commenced
reading
and
studying
expecting
to
have
but
a
few
days
at
home
then
to
soon
leave
on
a
very
hard
mission
my
wife
and
family
were
kind
and
loving
and
i
enjoyed
home
as
much
as
any
one
could
a
few
days
after
my
arrival
bishop
tucker
of
fairview
and
others
wished
me
to
go
with
them
to
explore
castle
valley
on
this
trip
i
read
and
made
most
of
the
selections
afterward
approved
of
and
printed
the
first
indications
of
the
pleasant
valley
coal
mines
were
discovered
on
this
trip
by
lycurgus
wilson
also
the
country
known
as
emery
county
was
prospected
for
settling
i
once
noticed
a
rail
road
guide
book
where
general
johnston
was
given
credit
of
opening
the
road
down
price
creek
canyon
this
is
not
correct
no
road
was
there
until
the
rail
road
was
worked
through
captain
seldon
took
a
party
up
spanish
fork
through
a
short
canyon
to
the
east
of
price
creek
according
to
the
best
information
in
my
possession
the
credit
is
due
to
sam
gilson
for
first
penetrating
and
passing
through
price
canyon
after
spending
about
three
weeks
i
returned
to
salt
lake
city
the
selections
being
approved
work
on
the
printing
was
soon
commenced
there
being
no
one
competent
to
judge
of
the
translation
brother
brigham
asked
me
how
we
proposed
to
prove
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
authorities
of
the
church
that
the
translation
was
correct
my
proposition
was
to
take
a
book
in
english
we
trejo
and
i
were
not
acquainted
with
let
trejo
translate
it
into
spanish
then
i
without
ever
seeing
the
book
would
take
his
translation
and
write
it
into
english
and
compare
it
with
the
original
brother
brigham
said
that
was
fair
he
asked
me
if
i
was
familiar
with
spencer
letters
i
said
i
was
not
as
i
had
never
read
them
he
sent
me
to
the
office
to
tell
brother
smith
to
let
trejo
have
a
copy
and
do
as
i
proposed
on
furnishing
our
translation
as
agreed
upon
brother
smith
laughingly
remarked
i
like
brother
jones
style
better
than
brother
spencer
it
is
the
same
in
substance
but
the
language
is
more
easily
understood
brother
trejo
was
instructed
to
carefully
the
selections
and
get
them
ready
for
the
printers
we
were
advised
to
call
upon
apostle
taylor
and
ask
him
to
advise
us
as
he
had
been
in
charge
of
the
publishing
of
the
book
of
mormon
into
the
french
language
brother
taylor
said
he
did
not
think
we
could
do
the
work
and
he
would
rather
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
i
told
him
we
had
been
appointed
by
the
highest
authority
that
there
was
in
the
church
to
do
the
work
and
we
believed
we
could
do
it
and
make
as
good
a
translation
as
any
that
had
been
made
two
others
of
the
apostles
were
present
whether
they
remember
this
or
not
is
a
question
but
i
am
satisfied
that
brother
taylor
never
forgot
my
answer
when
the
printing
was
commenced
brother
brigham
told
me
that
he
would
hold
me
responsible
for
its
correctness
this
weighed
heavily
upon
my
mind
so
much
so
that
i
asked
the
lord
to
in
some
way
manifest
to
me
when
there
were
mistakes
brother
joseph
bull
allowed
us
an
extra
reading
of
the
proof
the
printers
did
not
understand
a
word
of
spanish
and
could
only
follow
literally
the
copy
they
soon
however
acquired
an
idea
of
the
spelling
that
made
it
easier
than
at
first
the
manuscript
as
written
by
brother
trejo
was
at
times
rather
after
the
modern
notion
of
good
style
when
i
called
his
attention
to
errors
he
invariably
agreed
with
me
he
often
remarked
that
i
was
a
close
critic
and
understood
spanish
better
than
he
did
i
did
not
like
to
tell
him
how
i
discerned
the
mistakes
i
felt
a
sensation
in
the
center
of
my
forehead
as
though
there
was
a
fine
fiber
being
drawn
smoothly
out
when
a
mistake
occurred
the
smoothness
would
be
interrupted
as
though
a
small
knot
was
passing
out
through
the
forehead
whether
i
saw
the
mistake
or
not
i
was
so
sure
it
existed
that
i
would
direct
my
companion
attention
to
it
and
call
on
him
to
correct
it
when
this
was
done
we
continued
on
until
the
same
occurred
again
president
young
gave
us
all
the
encouragement
and
advice
necessary
brothers
george
smith
cannon
and
orson
pratt
also
manifested
much
interest
in
the
mission
as
well
as
a
great
many
others
who
contributed
means
to
pay
for
the
publishing
of
the
book
chapter
xxxv
the
missionaries
for
mexico
we
are
to
explore
the
country
our
outfit
and
mode
of
travel
our
stubborn
mules
incidents
of
the
journey
while
the
work
of
printing
was
in
the
press
the
brethren
wanted
to
go
on
the
mission
were
selected
it
was
agreed
instead
of
going
by
rail
road
and
ocean
to
mexico
that
we
would
fit
up
with
pack
and
saddle
animals
and
go
through
and
explore
arizona
on
our
trip
at
this
time
there
was
but
little
known
by
our
people
of
arizona
even
salt
river
valley
was
not
known
by
the
head
men
hardy
men
of
faith
and
energy
were
wanted
for
the
trip
besides
myself
there
were
selected
j
stewart
helaman
pratt
wiley
jones
my
son
smith
ammon
tenney
and
ivins
the
book
of
one
hundred
pages
was
now
ready
being
bound
in
paper
about
the
of
september
we
appointed
to
meet
at
nephi
and
start
from
there
with
pack
animals
two
of
the
company
being
in
the
extreme
south
were
to
join
us
at
kanab
we
left
nephi
about
the
of
september
and
with
our
books
some
two
thousand
packed
on
mules
we
started
out
we
had
a
good
outfit
for
the
trip
the
people
of
the
settlements
as
we
passed
along
assisted
us
in
every
way
some
additions
were
made
to
our
outfit
one
place
cedar
city
gave
so
much
dried
fruit
that
it
became
necessary
for
us
to
have
another
pack
mule
which
was
readily
furnished
we
stopped
a
short
time
at
toquerville
where
brother
ivins
joined
us
from
here
we
went
to
kanab
where
our
company
was
completed
by
brother
tenney
joining
the
route
chosen
was
by
the
way
of
lee
ferry
thence
to
the
moquis
villages
brother
tenney
having
been
to
these
villages
some
years
before
was
to
be
our
guide
to
that
point
after
which
we
were
to
make
our
way
through
an
unknown
country
the
best
we
could
our
instructions
were
to
explore
the
little
colorado
some
few
years
previous
to
this
a
large
company
had
been
called
to
go
and
settle
arizona
they
had
penetrated
beyond
the
colorado
some
miles
but
finding
no
water
had
all
returned
except
one
small
company
under
brother
john
blythe
the
names
of
which
as
far
as
obtained
are
david
bennett
william
solomon
ira
hatch
james
mangrum
thomas
smith
and
son
these
remained
doing
all
they
could
to
carry
out
the
design
of
the
mission
until
circumstances
caused
their
honorable
release
their
history
and
experience
there
would
make
quite
a
chapter
but
i
can
not
claim
the
right
or
memory
to
record
it
one
little
incident
i
will
relate
to
show
how
i
came
to
be
called
to
explore
arizona
in
connection
with
this
mission
to
mexico
which
could
have
been
made
in
an
easier
way
than
traveling
so
far
with
pack
mules
i
was
in
president
young
office
one
day
when
several
others
were
present
brother
staines
came
in
and
was
telling
about
having
heard
a
brother
mcmaster
of
the
ward
related
a
remarkable
occurrence
whilst
on
this
first
arizona
trip
brother
mcmaster
statement
as
told
by
brother
staines
was
that
there
were
several
hundred
persons
with
teams
in
a
perishing
condition
they
had
passed
some
miles
beyond
the
colorado
and
no
water
could
be
found
some
one
had
gone
on
up
the
little
colorado
and
found
that
entirely
dry
brother
mcmaster
being
chaplain
went
out
and
pled
with
the
lord
for
water
soon
there
was
a
fall
of
rain
and
snow
depositing
plenty
of
water
for
the
cattle
and
to
fill
up
all
their
barrels
they
were
camped
in
a
rocky
place
where
there
were
many
small
holes
that
soon
filled
up
in
the
morning
all
were
refreshed
barrels
filled
up
and
all
turned
back
rejoicing
in
the
goodness
of
the
lord
in
saving
them
from
perishing
they
returned
to
salt
lake
and
reported
arizona
uninhabitable
after
brother
staines
had
finished
some
remarks
were
made
by
different
ones
i
was
sitting
near
by
and
just
in
front
of
brother
brigham
i
had
just
been
telling
him
something
about
my
labors
among
the
indians
he
said
nothing
for
a
few
moments
but
sat
looking
me
straight
in
the
eye
finally
he
asked
what
do
you
think
of
that
brother
jones
i
answered
i
would
have
filled
up
went
on
and
prayed
again
brother
brigham
replied
putting
his
hand
upon
me
this
is
the
man
that
shall
take
charge
of
the
next
trip
to
arizona
not
long
after
crossing
the
colorado
we
were
overtaken
by
an
indian
bringing
us
a
telegram
from
president
young
sent
to
kanab
directing
us
to
visit
salt
river
valley
as
he
had
been
informed
something
about
it
since
our
departure
this
changed
our
intended
direction
somewhat
as
we
were
intending
to
make
toward
the
rio
grande
a
country
that
i
was
acquainted
with
on
arriving
at
the
moquis
villages
the
indians
were
much
pleased
to
see
us
and
were
very
friendly
their
country
and
villages
have
been
described
so
well
and
often
that
i
will
say
but
little
about
them
they
are
a
peaceable
honest
class
dwelling
in
villages
that
have
a
very
ancient
appearance
situated
on
high
bluffs
facing
a
dry
sandy
plain
and
distant
some
sixty
miles
from
the
little
colorado
river
the
indians
farm
by
catching
the
rain
water
which
runs
down
from
the
hills
and
conduct
it
upon
the
more
sandy
spots
thus
gathering
moisture
enough
to
mature
beans
pumpkins
early
corn
melons
and
a
few
other
early
vegetables
they
have
a
number
of
peach
trees
that
grow
in
the
sand
ridges
bearing
a
very
good
fruit
of
which
they
dry
the
most
they
save
and
eat
every
thing
they
possibly
can
they
own
quite
a
number
of
horses
sheep
and
goats
they
seem
to
be
happy
well
fed
and
contented
making
some
blankets
and
clothing
of
a
rude
kind
as
there
may
be
readers
of
this
work
more
interested
in
the
travels
and
the
country
through
which
we
passed
than
the
mission
in
which
we
were
engaged
for
their
benefit
i
will
describe
our
outfit
and
mode
of
travel
on
leaving
kanab
there
were
seven
of
us
with
saddle
animals
brother
pratt
rode
a
contrary
mule
we
had
some
fourteen
head
of
pack
animals
our
books
were
in
convenient
bales
for
packing
all
our
provisions
which
were
ample
were
put
up
in
canvas
bags
there
was
one
mule
for
water
kegs
and
one
horse
for
kitchen
traps
the
latter
was
well
suited
for
his
position
for
nothing
would
excite
him
we
had
to
depend
entirely
on
the
grass
to
sustain
our
animals
as
we
could
not
carry
grain
for
them
in
the
early
travels
of
western
explorers
grass
was
the
only
feed
it
was
much
more
fresh
and
abundant
than
at
the
present
time
now
throughout
the
western
country
almost
every
watering
place
is
occupied
by
the
ranchman
cattle
at
night
our
animals
were
hoppled
and
turned
out
when
any
danger
was
expected
we
would
guard
them
if
there
was
no
danger
we
went
to
bed
and
hunted
them
up
in
the
morning
sometimes
this
was
quite
a
labor
we
had
one
span
of
mules
that
seemed
determined
to
get
back
to
utah
we
tried
many
times
to
hamper
them
sometimes
with
seeming
success
but
they
soon
learned
to
travel
side
or
or
one
tied
to
the
other
most
of
us
were
old
travelers
that
is
we
had
all
had
considerable
experience
in
handling
animals
in
camp
but
these
mules
showed
more
cunning
and
perseverance
than
any
we
had
seen
before
once
they
traveled
with
hopples
some
sixteen
miles
i
happened
to
strike
their
trail
first
after
tracking
them
about
five
miles
i
found
ammon
tenney
saddle
horse
with
a
few
other
animals
i
managed
to
catch
the
horse
and
with
nothing
but
my
suspenders
for
a
bridle
i
followed
on
alone
until
i
overtook
the
mules
they
tried
to
run
away
from
me
but
i
managed
to
head
them
back
and
drove
them
several
miles
before
daring
to
take
the
hopples
off
the
horse
i
was
riding
was
quite
sharp
backed
by
this
time
not
like
the
king
who
cried
my
kingdom
for
a
horse
i
thought
my
kingdom
for
a
saddle
so
i
commenced
to
study
how
to
make
one
and
succeeded
finely
i
took
off
my
overalls
pulled
some
hair
out
of
the
horse
tail
and
tied
the
bottom
of
the
legs
together
then
pulled
the
grass
and
stuffed
the
overalls
full
both
legs
and
body
this
formed
a
pad
fast
at
both
ends
but
separate
in
the
middle
this
i
placed
lengthwise
on
the
back
of
the
horse
with
body
end
forward
so
that
i
could
hold
the
waistband
end
together
with
one
hand
to
keep
the
grass
from
working
out
under
the
circumstances
this
made
me
quite
comfortable
and
i
drove
the
mules
back
to
camp
all
right
my
companions
laughed
heartily
as
i
rode
in
but
acknowledged
that
i
was
a
good
saddler
a
few
nights
after
we
were
discussing
these
mules
brother
tenney
proposed
that
we
tie
each
mule
to
the
other
tail
this
worked
like
a
charm
we
had
no
further
trouble
as
they
simply
followed
each
other
round
and
round
and
got
their
fill
of
travel
without
going
very
far
from
camp
there
was
some
uneasiness
felt
by
brothers
tenney
and
ivins
about
meeting
the
indians
who
had
killed
whitmore
as
they
had
never
come
in
to
make
peace
with
the
mormon
settlements
as
we
neared
the
we
were
all
somewhat
anxious
and
kept
a
good
brother
tenney
knew
these
indians
well
and
said
he
would
be
able
to
recognize
them
from
any
others
the
navajoes
who
had
formerly
been
hostile
were
now
at
peace
and
coming
in
to
trade
for
horses
but
the
indians
dreaded
were
still
supposed
to
be
on
the
war
path
on
arriving
at
the
we
camped
near
the
edge
of
some
willows
keeping
a
good
watch
we
made
an
early
camp
shortly
before
sundown
brother
tenney
who
was
on
the
alert
suddenly
said
here
they
are
we
are
in
for
it
at
this
time
about
twenty
indians
on
horseback
showed
themselves
some
two
hundred
yards
from
us
they
came
somewhat
slily
out
of
the
willows
brother
tenney
recognized
them
at
once
as
the
hostiles
i
told
him
to
make
friendly
signs
and
tell
them
to
approach
as
he
talked
their
language
well
i
told
the
rest
to
be
ready
but
to
make
no
moves
brother
tenney
and
i
stepped
unarmed
out
from
the
willows
and
walked
a
little
way
in
the
direction
of
the
indians
they
approached
us
slowly
brother
tenney
told
them
to
come
on
as
we
were
friends
we
stood
waiting
for
them
to
approach
us
when
they
came
up
we
shook
hands
and
i
was
introduced
as
a
mormon
captain
who
was
a
great
friend
to
the
indians
one
who
never
wanted
to
fight
them
and
had
a
good
heart
for
the
indian
race
really
i
felt
no
fear
for
we
were
sent
out
as
messengers
of
peace
to
this
very
people
still
i
believed
in
being
prudent
and
not
giving
them
a
chance
to
get
the
advantage
of
us
for
this
band
of
indians
were
noted
for
their
treachery
even
by
the
other
indian
tribes
like
most
indians
they
wanted
to
know
if
we
had
anything
to
eat
i
told
them
we
had
and
if
they
would
do
as
i
wanted
them
to
that
i
would
give
them
a
good
supper
they
agreed
to
do
so
i
showed
them
where
to
make
their
camp
some
yards
from
ours
in
an
open
spot
i
told
them
that
my
men
were
not
acquainted
with
them
and
were
a
little
afraid
and
that
they
must
not
go
near
them
but
that
brother
tenney
and
i
knew
them
and
were
not
afraid
of
them
i
told
two
of
the
indians
to
bring
some
wood
to
our
camp
which
they
did
i
also
told
them
to
get
their
wood
and
water
and
turn
their
horses
out
with
ours
and
get
everything
ready
before
night
so
that
they
would
not
want
to
leave
their
camp
after
dark
as
our
men
might
be
scared
if
they
moved
about
then
we
had
an
abundance
of
provisions
so
we
gave
them
a
good
hearty
supper
brother
tenney
and
i
talked
with
them
until
bedtime
they
said
they
had
desired
to
make
peace
with
the
mormons
but
were
afraid
to
come
in
i
agreed
to
give
them
a
paper
next
morning
stating
that
we
had
met
them
and
that
they
desired
peace
our
party
laid
on
their
arms
all
night
watching
these
indians
none
slept
they
kept
faith
with
us
and
not
one
of
them
stirred
during
the
night
we
had
breakfast
early
in
the
morning
and
sent
two
of
the
indians
to
bring
up
our
animals
we
gave
them
some
more
provisions
wrote
their
recommend
and
then
started
on
leaving
the
indians
cooking
their
breakfast
and
we
saw
no
more
of
them
i
never
heard
of
them
committing
any
depredations
afterwards
chapter
xxxvi
our
explorations
arrival
at
phoenix
we
push
forward
on
our
journey
camp
among
thieves
a
meeting
held
with
indians
its
good
results
we
visited
a
few
days
with
the
moquis
who
received
us
very
kindly
after
taking
into
consideration
our
instructions
to
visit
salt
river
valley
we
tried
to
hire
an
indian
to
pilot
us
across
the
country
to
the
little
colorado
river
wishing
to
strike
it
at
the
nearest
point
we
were
told
that
there
was
no
water
on
the
route
no
one
seemed
to
want
the
job
to
guide
us
finally
an
indian
was
found
who
said
he
would
go
for
a
certain
number
of
silver
dollars
we
agreed
to
give
him
his
price
we
packed
up
filled
our
water
kegs
and
started
out
in
the
afternoon
the
guide
was
to
come
on
in
the
morning
and
overtake
us
we
traveled
a
few
miles
and
camped
next
morning
the
guide
came
up
but
demanded
more
pay
finally
we
consented
we
had
traveled
but
a
short
distance
when
he
demanded
another
advance
this
we
did
not
feel
inclined
to
make
so
brother
tenney
told
him
we
could
get
along
without
him
he
then
turned
back
there
was
no
trail
we
took
a
southerly
direction
trusting
to
our
own
judgment
to
get
through
after
traveling
a
few
hours
we
approached
near
some
hills
where
the
country
looked
like
there
might
be
water
we
turned
off
from
our
direction
went
up
into
the
hills
and
found
a
spring
of
good
fresh
water
we
our
kegs
and
watered
our
stock
it
was
somewhat
difficult
as
the
banks
were
steep
and
the
water
was
a
foot
or
more
below
the
surface
all
our
stock
drank
except
a
little
mexican
burro
that
would
not
approach
the
spring
we
all
got
around
him
and
pushed
him
up
to
the
brink
several
times
but
he
would
slip
away
from
us
we
knew
he
was
thirsty
but
he
would
not
drink
at
length
we
grabbed
hold
of
him
lifted
him
clear
from
the
ground
and
put
him
in
the
middle
of
the
spring
where
he
stood
quite
still
but
would
not
drink
so
he
beat
us
after
all
we
named
the
spring
tussle
jack
i
doubt
if
anyone
has
been
there
since
on
leaving
this
place
we
were
forced
by
the
formation
of
the
country
to
bear
in
a
westerly
direction
soon
we
struck
dim
trails
following
along
we
came
to
some
water
holes
in
a
ravine
but
passed
on
the
trails
soon
giving
out
we
again
turned
south
at
night
we
made
a
dry
camp
traveled
next
morning
about
two
miles
still
no
trail
we
found
some
water
but
it
was
barely
sufficient
to
water
our
animals
we
continued
traveling
all
day
without
a
trail
towards
night
we
came
to
a
large
dry
wash
with
cotton
woods
growing
along
it
having
heard
that
the
little
colorado
was
subject
to
drying
up
we
thought
this
was
perhaps
the
dry
bed
of
the
river
if
so
we
were
in
a
bad
fix
for
there
was
no
knowing
when
we
would
reach
water
brother
ivins
having
a
good
horse
rode
out
on
a
high
hill
to
look
for
signs
of
the
river
ahead
the
sun
was
just
setting
he
helloed
back
that
he
could
see
the
river
a
few
miles
further
on
this
news
was
received
with
a
shout
of
joy
we
started
on
traveling
with
the
stars
for
guides
the
country
became
quite
rough
and
broken
and
it
was
with
much
difficulty
that
we
finally
descended
from
the
bluffs
to
the
river
bottom
we
had
to
travel
some
time
before
getting
to
water
we
struck
the
bottom
at
a
bend
of
the
river
where
the
direction
of
the
stream
was
the
same
as
our
direction
of
travel
at
length
we
got
to
water
where
grass
and
wood
were
plentiful
all
felt
happy
for
here
we
knew
by
information
that
we
would
soon
strike
the
main
road
leading
to
prescott
arizona
we
had
a
map
of
this
road
and
country
we
had
been
traveling
for
some
time
through
a
strange
country
but
little
known
some
of
it
even
to
the
natives
we
now
felt
as
though
we
could
get
along
with
less
anxiety
we
remained
a
few
days
looking
at
the
country
further
up
the
river
so
as
to
be
able
to
report
to
president
young
which
we
did
as
soon
as
we
found
a
chance
to
mail
our
letters
we
now
took
the
wagon
road
leading
from
the
rio
grande
to
prescott
followed
a
westerly
direction
and
soon
reached
the
mogollon
mountains
the
first
night
out
from
the
little
colorado
we
camped
at
a
mail
station
which
had
two
men
in
charge
they
gave
us
considerable
information
about
the
country
next
day
we
reached
pine
station
a
place
then
deserted
here
we
met
two
men
from
phoenix
salt
river
valley
a
wharton
and
a
mcnulty
they
had
come
out
to
meet
their
families
who
were
moving
into
arizona
the
night
was
cold
and
stormy
next
day
was
the
same
so
we
laid
over
and
had
a
good
visit
with
these
gentlemen
they
were
two
of
the
most
prominent
men
in
phoenix
mcnulty
was
county
clerk
for
several
years
they
both
still
live
in
the
country
they
were
always
kind
and
friendly
to
our
people
and
never
forgot
our
first
friendly
acquaintance
in
the
lonely
camp
on
the
wild
mountain
road
we
left
our
letter
at
the
first
mail
station
we
got
the
direction
from
these
gentleman
as
to
the
shortest
and
best
road
to
salt
river
and
as
there
were
no
natives
to
visit
or
country
suitable
for
settling
before
reaching
phoenix
we
concluded
to
take
the
shortest
route
we
were
now
traveling
through
a
country
that
was
considered
somewhat
dangerous
more
from
outlaws
than
indians
the
apaches
having
been
driven
from
their
former
haunts
were
now
occupying
the
reservations
at
bowie
san
carlos
and
camp
apache
where
they
had
recently
been
located
by
the
management
of
general
crook
while
crossing
the
mogollon
mountains
the
weather
was
quite
cold
as
we
descended
toward
the
lower
valley
the
temperature
changed
very
rapidly
instead
of
overcoats
we
soon
hunted
shade
trees
we
were
much
surprised
on
entering
salt
river
valley
we
had
traveled
through
deserts
and
mountains
with
the
exception
of
the
little
colorado
valley
a
place
which
we
did
not
particularly
admire
for
a
long
ways
now
there
opened
before
us
a
sight
truly
lovely
a
fertile
looking
soil
and
miles
of
level
plain
in
the
distance
the
green
cotton
wood
trees
and
what
made
the
country
look
more
real
was
the
thrifty
little
settlement
of
phoenix
with
its
streets
already
planted
with
shade
trees
for
miles
strange
as
it
may
seem
at
the
time
we
started
in
september
the
valley
of
salt
river
was
not
known
even
to
brigham
young
our
animals
were
beginning
to
fail
as
they
had
lived
on
grass
since
leaving
kanab
we
bought
corn
at
four
cents
a
pound
and
commenced
feeding
them
a
little
although
salt
river
valley
is
naturally
fertile
owing
to
the
dryness
of
the
climate
there
is
no
grass
except
a
little
coarse
stuff
called
sacaton
we
camped
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
on
making
inquiry
we
learned
that
tempe
or
hayden
mill
seven
miles
further
up
the
river
would
be
a
better
place
to
stop
for
a
few
days
than
phoenix
hayden
being
one
of
the
oldest
and
most
enterprising
settlers
of
the
country
had
built
a
grist
mill
started
ranches
opened
a
store
blacksmith
wagon
shop
etc
as
we
were
passing
through
phoenix
we
met
a
few
indians
maricopas
and
pimas
i
called
one
of
them
to
me
and
asked
him
if
he
understood
mexican
he
said
he
did
i
told
him
who
we
were
and
that
our
mission
was
to
talk
to
the
natives
that
we
wished
to
get
the
pimas
and
maricopas
together
over
on
the
gila
and
talk
to
them
he
said
all
right
how
much
will
you
pay
me
to
go
and
notify
them
i
replied
we
will
pay
you
nothing
we
are
not
traveling
for
money
we
are
here
more
for
the
good
of
your
people
than
for
our
own
you
can
go
and
tell
them
or
not
just
as
you
please
he
said
that
he
understood
who
we
were
and
would
go
and
tell
the
indians
about
us
on
arriving
at
hayden
place
we
found
the
owner
an
agreeable
intelligent
gentlemen
who
was
much
interested
in
the
settlement
and
development
of
the
country
as
well
as
friendly
toward
the
mormons
he
being
a
pioneer
in
reality
having
been
for
many
years
in
the
west
and
could
fully
sympathize
with
the
mormon
people
in
settling
the
deserts
he
gave
us
much
true
and
useful
information
about
the
country
and
natives
here
we
traded
off
some
of
our
pack
mules
and
surplus
provisions
we
had
already
traded
for
a
light
spring
wagon
finding
that
the
country
before
us
could
be
traveled
with
wagons
we
remained
here
a
few
days
camping
at
the
ranch
of
winchester
miller
his
barley
was
up
several
inches
high
but
he
allowed
us
to
turn
our
animals
into
his
fields
and
treated
us
in
a
kind
hospitable
manner
the
friendly
acquaintance
made
at
this
time
has
always
been
kept
up
miller
was
an
energetic
man
and
manifested
a
great
desire
to
have
the
mormons
come
there
and
settle
he
had
already
noticed
the
place
where
the
jonesville
ditch
is
now
located
he
told
me
about
it
saying
it
was
the
best
ditchsite
on
the
river
what
he
said
has
proved
true
we
wrote
to
president
young
describing
the
country
after
resting
a
few
days
we
started
for
the
gila
striking
it
at
morgan
station
this
was
near
the
lower
villages
of
the
pimas
the
indians
had
heard
of
us
and
wanted
to
hear
us
talk
we
did
not
say
much
at
this
place
but
told
the
indians
we
would
stop
at
sacaton
the
upper
settlement
and
have
a
good
long
talk
with
the
people
that
there
we
hoped
to
meet
all
the
leading
men
of
the
tribe
next
day
we
traveled
up
along
the
north
side
of
the
river
gila
passing
a
number
of
the
pima
villages
talking
a
few
words
and
giving
out
our
appointment
most
of
the
way
there
was
no
road
and
sometimes
it
was
rather
difficult
to
get
along
with
our
carriage
we
arrived
that
night
at
twin
buttes
or
hayden
trading
station
here
quite
a
number
of
indians
came
to
see
us
and
we
had
a
pleasant
talk
with
them
it
was
here
i
met
for
the
first
time
an
indian
named
francisco
chico
who
spoke
spanish
quite
well
this
man
will
appear
again
in
this
history
next
day
early
we
arrived
at
sacaton
there
was
no
feed
except
a
little
grass
among
the
thorny
brush
on
the
river
bottom
there
was
a
trader
here
doing
quite
a
business
i
went
to
his
store
and
asked
him
if
he
had
any
hay
or
fodder
for
sale
he
looked
at
me
in
surprise
and
said
mister
that
is
something
the
country
do
produce
then
what
are
travelers
to
do
that
wish
to
stop
over
here
for
a
few
days
i
asked
there
are
no
travelers
with
any
sense
that
want
to
stop
over
here
you
had
better
pack
up
and
go
on
you
can
get
fodder
up
at
juan
near
florence
but
there
is
none
here
i
answered
well
we
want
to
stop
and
will
have
to
put
up
with
what
there
is
i
see
there
is
a
little
grass
among
the
brush
we
will
have
to
feed
all
the
more
grain
we
can
get
plenty
of
that
i
suppose
you
had
better
not
stay
he
said
if
you
turn
your
stock
out
they
will
be
stolen
from
you
i
have
lived
here
ten
years
am
friendly
with
the
indians
but
they
are
the
biggest
thieves
you
ever
saw
i
tell
you
not
to
trust
them
there
are
some
poor
people
now
in
camp
down
there
two
men
and
a
woman
the
d
d
thieves
have
stolen
their
stock
and
will
not
fetch
it
back
unless
they
pay
them
five
dollars
a
head
and
as
they
have
not
got
the
money
they
are
in
a
bad
fix
the
indians
will
serve
you
the
same
way
we
concluded
that
here
was
a
chance
to
commence
to
work
and
do
some
good
we
made
camp
in
an
opening
among
the
brush
soon
quite
a
number
of
indians
collected
around
camp
i
told
some
of
them
to
take
our
animals
and
watch
them
until
night
then
bring
them
in
for
their
corn
we
put
a
bell
on
one
of
the
animals
i
told
the
indians
not
to
take
them
so
far
we
could
not
hear
the
bell
we
went
back
to
the
for
some
grain
i
told
him
what
we
had
done
he
said
i
was
like
other
smart
alecks
that
had
just
come
among
the
indians
but
that
we
would
be
in
the
same
fix
as
the
party
was
who
had
lost
their
stock
i
told
him
we
would
not
lose
one
of
our
animals
but
that
i
believed
i
could
induce
the
indians
to
return
those
they
had
stolen
from
the
poor
people
he
said
you
must
be
either
crazy
or
in
colusion
with
the
indians
i
told
him
we
were
neither
at
feeding
time
all
the
animals
were
brought
in
after
feeding
them
they
were
again
turned
over
to
the
indians
next
morning
all
were
brought
in
this
being
the
day
appointed
for
the
meeting
about
ten
the
indians
commenced
gathering
we
found
an
excellent
interpreter
in
francisco
capulla
he
seemed
quite
intelligent
and
ready
to
comprehend
what
we
told
him
we
talked
quite
a
while
with
the
interpreter
before
requesting
the
people
to
listen
to
us
finally
there
gathered
between
three
and
four
hundred
we
were
told
that
all
the
captains
had
arrived
and
were
ready
to
listen
to
what
we
had
to
say
i
told
the
interpreter
to
explain
to
them
what
we
had
been
telling
him
he
talked
quite
a
while
in
the
pima
tongue
in
an
earnest
spirited
manner
when
he
got
through
a
few
remarks
were
made
by
some
of
the
old
men
the
interpreter
told
us
they
were
much
interested
in
what
they
had
heard
and
wished
me
to
talk
more
and
tell
them
about
their
forefathers
said
they
knew
nothing
about
them
but
that
they
always
understood
that
sometime
there
would
be
those
coming
among
them
who
knew
all
about
these
things
i
now
felt
it
was
my
time
to
get
the
animals
which
had
been
stolen
from
the
poor
travelers
these
people
were
sitting
in
sight
looking
very
much
disheartened
i
pointed
to
them
and
told
the
indians
it
made
me
feel
sorrowful
to
see
those
poor
people
there
and
that
it
weighed
on
my
heart
so
that
i
could
not
talk
and
that
i
wished
some
of
the
young
men
would
go
and
hunt
their
stock
up
i
never
hinted
that
i
thought
they
had
stolen
them
away
after
this
there
was
some
little
among
the
indians
the
interpreter
asked
me
to
go
on
and
talk
to
the
people
the
indians
got
very
much
interested
when
i
commenced
to
explain
to
them
the
book
of
mormon
i
will
here
say
that
in
all
my
labors
among
the
indians
i
have
never
known
of
one
failing
to
be
interested
when
the
book
of
mormon
was
introduced
these
pimas
were
intelligent
and
capable
of
understanding
all
we
said
to
them
i
then
again
referred
to
the
disagreeable
subject
telling
them
that
i
still
felt
grieved
one
of
the
chiefs
spoke
up
asking
me
to
go
on
as
the
stock
had
been
found
and
were
being
brought
to
the
owners
i
now
felt
free
to
talk
and
gave
them
much
instruction
brother
tenney
being
a
good
interpreter
having
had
much
experience
among
the
natives
of
lower
california
explained
with
much
clearness
the
gospel
of
repentance
to
these
people
a
good
spirit
prevailed
and
the
indians
manifested
a
desire
to
be
instructed
acknowledged
their
degraded
condition
and
said
they
wished
the
mormons
would
come
to
their
country
to
live
and
teach
them
how
to
do
we
all
felt
well
paid
for
the
hardships
we
had
gone
through
for
we
could
see
here
was
a
chance
for
a
good
work
to
be
done
we
were
in
no
way
annoyed
our
animals
were
watched
and
brought
in
regularly
to
feed
when
we
got
ready
to
start
on
everything
was
in
good
shape
we
bade
the
indians
promising
that
the
mormons
would
visit
them
again
and
some
of
them
would
probably
come
and
live
in
their
country
the
trader
never
knew
how
to
account
for
our
way
of
doing
with
the
pimas
from
here
we
went
a
day
travel
farther
up
the
gila
to
juan
largos
villages
juan
a
papago
indian
presided
over
quite
a
settlement
of
his
people
his
son
was
educated
so
as
to
read
we
gave
him
a
copy
of
our
book
these
extracts
from
the
book
of
mormon
we
had
been
presenting
to
a
few
of
the
indians
and
some
of
the
mexicans
on
our
road
many
years
afterwards
the
indians
showed
me
these
books
they
prize
them
highly
at
juan
largos
the
people
came
together
and
we
taught
them
the
same
as
we
had
the
pimas
francisco
capulla
went
to
this
village
with
us
he
became
much
interested
in
our
teachings
his
home
was
in
sonora
he
was
here
only
on
a
visit
i
have
often
heard
of
but
have
never
seen
him
since
we
found
that
many
of
the
older
indians
on
the
gila
remembered
the
mormon
battalion
that
passed
through
their
country
in
chapter
xxxvii
we
visit
the
governor
of
arizona
an
indian
country
my
talk
with
the
natives
the
custom
officer
he
favors
our
entry
into
mexico
on
leaving
the
gila
our
route
led
to
tucson
we
crossed
the
mile
desert
where
the
battalion
suffered
so
much
for
water
when
we
crossed
there
were
two
wells
furnishing
good
pure
water
one
two
hundred
feet
deep
where
there
was
a
small
stock
ranch
and
station
for
support
the
owner
sold
water
to
travelers
at
tucson
we
received
a
letter
from
brigham
young
from
which
i
will
give
a
short
extract
dated
salt
lake
city
november
since
your
departure
from
salt
lake
city
on
your
way
southward
more
than
one
hundred
and
fifty
have
been
called
to
aid
in
the
building
up
of
the
kingdom
of
god
in
various
parts
of
the
earth
among
these
a
party
have
started
in
charge
of
elder
james
brown
who
intends
to
winter
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
moencoppy
without
a
more
suitable
place
is
found
and
from
there
spread
out
as
opportunity
offers
at
tucson
we
found
quite
a
number
of
white
residents
this
old
town
has
been
so
well
described
by
many
writers
that
i
will
simply
say
it
never
was
is
not
now
and
never
will
be
much
its
only
merit
is
in
its
being
so
very
old
some
two
hundred
and
years
our
intention
had
been
to
go
from
tucson
to
sonora
but
at
the
time
there
was
a
hot
revolution
under
way
and
everything
was
in
confusion
there
was
no
safety
whatever
for
anyone
entering
the
country
we
had
a
letter
of
introduction
from
hayden
of
tempe
to
gov
safford
who
resided
in
tucson
we
had
a
pleasant
visit
with
his
excellency
safford
is
much
respected
by
the
inhabitants
of
arizona
he
having
been
the
framer
of
the
arizona
public
school
system
which
is
acknowledged
to
be
excellent
from
the
governor
we
received
a
letter
to
jeffries
the
indian
agent
at
apache
pass
we
were
invited
to
preach
in
the
court
house
at
tucson
and
had
a
good
attendance
and
attention
the
had
me
pictured
out
as
being
by
a
lot
of
women
while
preaching
in
a
town
in
arizona
tucson
was
the
only
town
we
preached
in
in
arizona
while
on
this
mission
so
much
for
sensational
reports
owing
to
the
unsettled
state
of
affairs
in
sonora
we
concluded
to
go
farther
east
and
visit
el
paso
and
then
go
into
the
state
of
chihuahua
our
mixed
outfit
both
wagon
and
pack
animals
were
inconvenient
and
as
the
roads
were
good
we
concluded
to
get
another
wagon
having
sold
some
of
our
animals
we
had
money
to
spare
so
we
bought
an
excellent
wagon
from
the
quartermaster
at
the
post
near
tucson
we
now
had
a
good
outfit
our
wagons
took
the
place
of
the
pack
animals
but
we
retained
our
saddle
horses
the
next
place
of
importance
to
which
we
looked
forward
with
some
anxiety
was
fort
bowie
on
arriving
there
we
presented
our
letters
to
jeffries
who
was
in
charge
of
the
reservation
at
bowie
but
the
indians
seemed
to
be
in
charge
of
both
jeffries
and
several
companies
of
soldiers
stationed
there
for
the
indians
did
about
as
they
pleased
it
was
considered
somewhat
risky
to
pass
through
the
apache
pass
according
to
an
agreement
made
at
beaver
with
wells
to
be
careful
we
camped
a
day
travel
this
side
of
the
indians
and
with
one
of
the
brethren
went
in
to
see
how
things
looked
i
felt
a
little
uneasy
the
indians
were
under
no
control
whatever
save
that
of
the
government
gave
them
everything
they
wanted
and
more
they
had
provisions
of
every
kind
so
abundantly
that
a
great
deal
was
wasted
they
had
all
the
guns
and
ammunition
they
wanted
and
were
allowed
to
raid
at
will
into
sonora
and
chihuahua
it
was
generally
believed
that
they
were
encouraged
by
some
of
the
whites
in
their
raiding
when
i
talked
with
the
agent
he
said
we
were
safe
enough
if
we
did
not
happen
to
run
across
any
drunken
indians
on
the
road
but
as
the
weather
was
cold
and
disagreeable
he
did
not
think
any
of
them
would
be
out
advised
us
to
stop
at
the
mail
station
near
the
fort
and
not
turn
out
any
animals
we
went
back
to
camp
and
reported
all
felt
like
we
would
be
safe
we
all
had
faith
in
being
protected
for
we
were
on
a
mission
not
of
our
own
choosing
we
got
in
next
day
all
right
our
animals
needed
shoeing
so
we
concluded
to
lay
over
a
day
i
had
a
great
desire
to
talk
to
these
indians
believing
that
they
would
listen
a
little
i
made
some
inquiry
of
the
trader
who
had
been
with
them
for
some
years
about
their
traditions
he
said
they
had
none
only
to
murder
and
steal
this
i
found
afterwards
to
be
a
great
mistake
i
asked
jeffries
permission
to
talk
to
the
indians
he
rather
jeeringly
replied
i
do
think
you
can
get
them
to
listen
to
you
i
am
the
only
man
they
will
talk
to
i
answered
all
i
ask
is
your
permission
and
if
they
wo
listen
to
me
all
right
he
said
go
ahead
i
guess
you
ca
make
them
much
worse
than
they
are
anyway
i
inquired
if
any
of
the
indians
talked
spanish
their
interpreter
a
drunken
little
mexican
offered
to
interpret
if
i
would
pay
him
saying
that
that
was
his
business
and
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
talk
to
the
indians
except
through
him
i
told
him
that
the
agent
had
given
me
the
privilege
of
talking
to
them
that
i
was
not
working
for
money
and
that
i
did
not
intend
to
pay
for
any
interpreting
he
then
pointed
out
an
indian
that
spoke
tolerable
fair
spanish
i
approached
the
indian
and
spoke
to
him
he
answered
quite
short
and
asked
what
i
wanted
i
told
him
that
what
i
wanted
to
say
to
him
was
for
his
people
good
that
if
he
would
listen
to
me
a
few
minutes
he
could
then
judge
he
looked
me
in
the
eye
for
a
moment
and
then
said
all
right
say
what
you
please
i
asked
him
if
the
apaches
had
any
knowledge
of
their
fathers
counting
back
many
counts
he
answered
that
they
had
lost
that
and
did
not
know
anything
about
them
i
showed
him
one
of
our
books
and
informed
him
that
it
told
about
their
old
fathers
at
this
he
got
up
and
called
to
a
lot
of
other
indians
that
were
loafing
around
some
thirty
or
forty
soon
gathered
around
me
i
commenced
and
explained
considerable
to
them
they
were
growing
quite
interested
when
the
agent
was
seen
approaching
they
seemed
to
understand
that
my
words
were
not
for
the
agent
ears
and
manifested
as
much
by
their
remarks
so
i
changed
the
subject
and
said
that
the
mormons
had
also
sent
us
to
look
for
country
to
settle
as
we
were
growing
and
wished
new
country
that
we
would
perhaps
settle
near
them
that
we
were
friends
to
the
red
man
and
hoped
the
apaches
would
be
friendly
with
us
the
agent
had
approached
near
enough
to
hear
this
talk
he
stayed
around
giving
me
no
further
chance
to
explain
the
book
of
mormon
to
them
he
made
some
remarks
to
call
their
attention
away
from
me
i
could
see
plainly
that
he
wished
me
to
stop
talking
so
i
told
the
indians
we
would
meet
again
sometime
i
felt
that
i
had
made
a
little
impression
for
good
upon
them
sometime
after
this
i
had
a
good
long
talk
with
the
apaches
which
i
will
give
an
account
of
in
the
proper
place
we
had
a
vague
idea
of
the
western
portion
of
chihuahua
where
the
mormons
are
now
settling
but
could
get
no
definite
directions
as
we
met
no
one
who
seemed
to
know
much
about
the
country
so
we
concluded
to
continue
on
the
main
road
to
el
paso
nothing
of
interest
occurred
on
the
way
all
went
well
with
us
we
drove
into
franklin
a
small
town
on
the
american
side
of
the
line
opposite
el
paso
the
main
question
now
was
how
will
we
be
able
to
pass
the
custom
house
and
get
our
books
and
outfit
over
the
line
into
mexico
many
persons
had
told
us
that
we
would
never
be
allowed
to
pass
as
catholicism
ruled
in
that
country
and
they
would
never
permit
us
to
enter
with
mormon
publications
our
hopes
were
in
the
overruling
power
to
help
us
none
of
us
pretended
to
have
wisdom
for
the
occasion
we
were
standing
in
the
street
about
noon
i
was
talking
to
a
gentleman
telling
him
that
we
wished
to
pass
over
the
line
at
once
with
our
outfit
our
mission
was
to
mexico
and
we
felt
like
going
ahead
and
getting
in
we
intended
to
remain
there
until
spring
it
was
now
january
while
talking
with
the
stranger
he
said
pointing
toward
three
men
passing
there
go
the
custom
officer
and
post
master
the
other
man
is
a
good
interpreter
the
post
master
is
an
american
but
is
a
great
friend
of
the
custom
officer
they
are
going
into
the
post
office
now
they
have
just
been
to
dinner
and
will
be
in
a
good
humor
you
had
better
go
at
once
and
see
them
i
went
to
the
office
and
inquired
if
i
could
see
the
custom
officer
i
was
invited
into
a
back
room
where
the
three
sat
smoking
politeness
is
the
rule
in
that
country
i
was
asked
to
take
a
seat
and
offered
a
cigar
the
custom
officer
inquired
through
the
interpreter
how
he
could
serve
me
i
told
him
i
was
traveling
with
some
others
seven
in
all
and
we
wished
to
cross
over
into
mexico
at
once
as
we
desired
to
winter
there
he
asked
about
our
outfit
then
our
loading
i
told
him
it
consisted
of
the
necessary
utensils
provisions
clothing
for
travelers
then
a
lot
of
books
we
intended
to
distribute
through
the
country
he
wanted
to
know
what
class
of
books
they
were
if
religious
i
told
him
they
were
he
said
he
would
rather
have
some
good
novels
that
he
did
not
care
much
for
religion
but
asked
what
denomination
we
represented
i
told
him
mormons
at
this
all
three
burst
into
loud
laughter
the
post
master
and
interpreter
making
many
jesting
remarks
to
the
officer
and
saying
to
me
yes
he
will
let
you
in
you
are
all
right
you
will
get
in
i
was
a
little
puzzled
not
knowing
whether
this
was
favorable
or
otherwise
soon
the
custom
officer
turned
as
yet
i
had
not
spoken
a
word
of
spanish
and
said
directly
to
me
well
i
guess
i
will
have
to
let
you
in
i
have
just
been
telling
these
gentlemen
that
i
am
a
mormon
in
principle
and
that
i
wished
some
of
them
would
come
along
that
i
thought
your
religion
the
most
sensible
of
any
you
will
do
good
in
mexico
and
you
shall
cross
over
i
will
fix
it
so
you
will
not
have
to
pay
a
cent
i
now
thanked
him
in
his
own
language
and
said
we
would
try
and
act
so
as
to
retain
the
good
opinion
he
had
of
us
and
our
people
we
shook
hands
as
friends
he
kept
his
word
entirely
and
we
crossed
over
at
once
rented
quarters
and
got
ready
for
the
winter
campaign
we
were
the
first
mormon
missionaries
that
entered
mexico
this
was
in
january
chapter
xxxviii
a
priest
warns
his
congregation
against
mormons
we
find
some
friends
our
plans
for
the
season
letter
from
president
young
threats
of
some
rowdies
the
peaceful
results
we
arrived
in
the
republic
of
mexico
on
friday
it
was
not
long
before
everyone
in
el
paso
knew
of
the
arrival
of
mormons
we
were
stared
at
but
nothing
occurred
until
sunday
that
indicated
anything
unusual
on
sunday
we
concluded
to
go
to
the
catholic
church
the
only
one
in
town
the
building
was
crowded
we
stood
in
a
group
near
the
entrance
there
was
quite
a
jam
of
people
around
as
and
many
furtive
glances
and
dark
wicked
looks
were
directed
toward
us
about
the
worst
element
in
mexico
can
be
found
in
paso
del
norte
or
el
paso
padre
borajo
pronounced
officiated
after
the
usual
services
of
tingling
bells
kneeling
before
the
cross
and
various
performances
common
in
a
mexican
catholic
church
services
were
over
the
padre
who
was
quite
old
and
lean
something
very
unusual
for
a
priest
most
of
them
being
rather
corpulent
mounted
the
stand
and
in
a
very
impressive
manner
commenced
to
warn
the
people
against
us
these
were
his
words
in
substance
the
world
history
gives
an
account
of
great
plagues
that
have
visited
the
world
from
time
to
time
mankind
has
been
subjected
to
great
calamities
such
as
wars
storms
cholera
small
pox
great
drouth
and
floods
we
of
this
land
have
been
subjected
to
many
plagues
the
murderous
apaches
have
made
war
upon
us
for
many
years
we
have
had
our
ditches
and
dams
destroyed
by
floods
so
that
some
seasons
we
have
had
to
suffer
hunger
we
have
had
many
revolutions
and
thousands
have
been
killed
lately
we
have
had
the
grasshoppers
come
and
destroy
every
green
herb
and
product
but
all
these
things
have
made
war
only
on
the
body
of
the
man
none
have
had
a
tendency
to
destroy
the
soul
now
of
all
the
plagues
that
ever
visited
the
earth
to
curse
and
destroy
mankind
we
have
the
worst
just
come
to
us
and
there
stand
the
representatives
of
this
plague
look
at
them
their
faces
show
what
they
are
thanks
to
god
we
have
been
warned
in
time
by
the
holy
pope
that
false
prophets
and
teachers
would
come
among
us
these
men
pointing
to
us
represent
all
that
is
low
and
depraved
they
have
destroyed
the
morals
of
their
own
people
and
have
now
come
here
to
pollute
the
people
of
this
place
i
thought
if
that
was
so
we
had
a
hard
job
on
hand
they
have
no
virtue
they
all
have
from
six
to
one
dozen
wives
now
they
have
come
here
to
extend
the
practice
into
mexico
denounce
yes
here
in
the
presence
of
the
image
of
the
virgin
mary
i
denounce
them
as
barbarians
and
i
want
you
all
to
get
their
books
and
fetch
them
to
me
and
i
will
burn
them
as
brother
tenney
was
not
present
i
was
the
only
one
of
our
party
who
perfectly
understood
his
words
i
began
to
feel
as
though
it
would
be
best
for
us
to
get
out
of
the
crowd
before
the
spirit
got
too
high
as
some
fanatic
might
be
tempted
to
slip
a
sharp
knife
in
among
our
ribs
we
managed
to
work
ourselves
gradually
out
of
the
crowd
which
filled
the
door
yard
for
several
feet
when
clear
we
walked
straight
way
to
our
quarters
where
i
translated
all
that
had
been
said
it
was
taken
down
at
the
time
and
to
the
best
of
my
memory
was
about
as
here
given
we
could
not
help
but
be
amused
at
the
old
fellow
vehemence
and
our
first
introduction
to
mexico
for
some
days
after
this
when
women
in
the
streets
would
see
any
of
us
coming
they
would
jump
into
the
first
door
and
close
it
and
then
look
out
through
what
all
mexican
houses
have
in
their
doors
a
peep
hole
some
of
the
women
who
ran
from
us
were
of
the
class
that
do
not
often
scare
at
a
man
yet
they
acted
as
though
they
dreaded
us
we
managed
to
pass
quietly
along
never
seeming
to
notice
these
actions
but
often
had
a
hearty
laugh
when
we
got
to
our
quarters
on
enquiry
we
learned
that
the
laws
of
mexico
under
the
new
constitution
required
all
religious
services
to
be
performed
in
a
structure
recognized
as
a
church
building
one
gentleman
esperidion
sanches
gave
us
much
information
he
said
the
law
simply
required
the
presiding
officer
of
a
town
to
recognize
a
house
for
the
occasion
and
put
the
police
to
protect
it
but
if
the
civil
authority
was
under
the
influence
of
the
priests
they
could
baffle
us
and
forbid
us
preaching
in
any
house
except
a
regular
church
edifice
erected
solely
for
religious
worship
sanches
told
me
the
jefe
politico
of
paso
del
norte
was
an
affable
gentleman
but
a
strong
catholic
and
he
doubted
if
we
would
be
able
to
get
the
privilege
of
holding
meetings
when
we
called
upon
the
gentleman
he
told
us
that
he
understood
the
law
forbade
any
religious
services
performed
except
in
a
house
especially
erected
for
religious
purposes
i
tried
to
reason
with
him
he
listened
to
me
patiently
but
said
no
difference
how
unreasonable
the
law
might
seem
we
would
have
to
submit
i
then
asked
him
if
the
law
defined
any
particular
material
to
be
used
or
size
or
shape
the
house
should
be
built
that
possibly
we
might
take
it
in
hand
to
build
a
church
this
he
could
not
answer
i
visited
him
several
times
but
to
no
purpose
the
laws
forbade
all
street
preaching
i
felt
determined
not
to
be
beaten
there
were
a
number
of
the
better
class
of
citizens
visited
us
and
protested
against
the
way
the
priest
had
talked
about
us
saying
that
none
but
ignorant
fanatics
would
sustain
such
talk
this
gave
us
an
opportunity
to
explain
our
mission
and
principles
to
many
that
would
not
have
listened
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
rabid
talk
finally
an
idea
occurred
to
me
president
young
had
presented
me
with
a
good
new
set
of
saddler
tools
before
leaving
salt
lake
city
he
had
said
that
they
might
help
me
out
sometime
when
nothing
else
would
so
i
called
once
more
on
the
jefe
politico
he
was
always
patient
and
polite
after
talking
a
while
about
the
meeting
house
i
told
him
i
had
given
up
the
idea
of
holding
meetings
until
i
went
to
chihuahua
and
saw
the
governor
this
seemed
to
please
him
for
he
desired
peace
and
he
was
afraid
for
us
to
attempt
holding
meetings
in
paso
del
norte
as
the
people
were
much
under
the
influence
of
i
asked
him
how
he
would
like
a
saddle
shop
started
he
said
it
would
be
a
good
thing
that
many
people
needed
saddles
and
had
to
pay
a
high
price
for
them
that
he
thought
i
could
do
well
making
saddles
in
fact
much
better
than
preaching
as
no
one
would
pay
me
for
preaching
but
would
be
glad
to
pay
me
a
big
price
for
a
good
saddle
when
i
talked
with
my
companions
showing
my
plans
all
agreed
with
me
so
we
rented
quite
a
large
house
for
a
saddler
shop
i
hired
a
bench
and
vise
put
up
my
tools
bought
some
timber
and
went
to
work
making
my
son
wiley
assisted
me
soon
the
people
began
to
call
in
to
look
at
my
work
as
there
was
no
law
against
conversation
especially
in
one
own
house
we
soon
got
to
having
quite
respectable
audiences
and
the
spirit
of
friendship
grew
up
toward
us
some
of
the
brethren
went
over
on
the
texas
side
to
ysleta
to
winter
where
the
stock
could
be
fed
more
cheaply
than
in
el
paso
brothers
tenney
and
smith
did
not
want
to
go
on
into
mexico
so
we
agreed
that
they
should
have
the
privilege
of
laboring
in
new
mexico
among
the
pueblos
and
zunis
and
then
return
home
as
they
never
reported
to
me
all
i
know
about
them
is
what
i
have
learned
from
others
brother
james
brown
took
charge
of
that
field
of
labor
about
this
time
i
received
the
following
letter
salt
lake
city
january
w
jones
el
paso
dear
brother
i
was
more
than
pleased
to
receive
your
favor
of
the
and
was
much
interested
in
its
contents
not
to
say
amused
at
your
account
of
the
oration
by
the
padre
as
an
introductory
greeting
into
mexico
like
you
i
doubt
not
but
that
the
opposition
bodes
good
for
you
and
the
success
of
your
mission
i
feel
that
it
would
be
wise
for
you
to
visit
the
old
original
blood
as
much
as
possible
let
the
catholic
church
alone
if
its
members
wish
to
hear
the
truth
expound
it
to
them
as
to
any
other
people
but
do
not
debate
with
them
and
as
to
the
curses
of
the
priests
you
need
not
regard
them
as
much
as
you
would
a
mosquito
in
the
season
of
the
year
when
these
insects
trouble
be
cautious
in
your
labors
and
movements
do
not
court
opposition
but
move
steadily
on
presenting
the
truths
of
the
gospel
to
those
who
will
hear
you
and
inviting
all
to
become
partakers
of
the
gospel
of
the
son
of
god
you
have
the
faith
and
prayers
of
all
that
you
will
be
able
to
do
a
good
work
and
i
have
no
doubt
but
that
you
will
see
me
again
in
the
flesh
yet
many
times
brother
james
brown
has
returned
from
his
visit
to
arizona
he
left
the
brethren
of
his
party
building
a
fort
at
moencoppy
feet
whilst
in
that
country
he
with
three
others
went
a
long
distance
up
the
little
colorado
river
from
the
moencoppy
passing
up
beyond
where
you
crossed
he
fully
substantiates
the
statements
made
by
yourself
and
the
brethren
of
your
party
with
regard
to
the
desirability
of
the
upper
valleys
of
the
little
colorado
as
settlements
for
the
saints
we
have
called
about
two
hundred
brethren
whom
we
think
of
dividing
into
companies
of
to
settle
on
the
little
colorado
and
adjacent
country
these
brethren
will
mostly
be
ready
to
start
by
the
of
february
a
most
excellent
spirit
prevails
with
regard
to
this
mission
amongst
the
brethren
and
numbers
more
would
have
been
willing
to
have
gone
had
they
been
wanted
we
shall
send
down
a
grist
and
during
the
summer
among
those
called
is
elder
lot
smith
who
will
have
charge
of
one
company
of
fifty
since
my
letter
to
you
of
addressed
to
tucson
we
have
had
a
very
peaceable
and
quiet
time
judge
white
set
me
at
liberty
soon
after
from
the
unjust
imprisonment
of
judge
boreman
for
contempt
brother
reynolds
has
again
been
tried
convicted
for
obeying
the
law
of
the
lord
and
sentenced
to
two
years
hard
labor
in
the
house
of
correction
at
detroit
and
fine
he
appealed
and
was
admitted
to
bail
the
appeal
will
come
up
in
june
brother
cannon
has
been
seated
in
congress
his
contestant
has
not
made
much
of
a
show
yet
i
notice
by
the
telegrams
that
christiancy
senator
from
michigan
has
introduced
a
bill
to
provide
for
challenges
to
jurors
in
trials
for
bigamy
and
polygamy
that
it
shall
be
sufficient
cause
for
the
rejection
of
a
juror
that
he
has
more
than
one
wife
living
or
that
he
it
morally
right
for
a
man
to
live
with
more
than
one
wife
well
the
faster
it
comes
the
sooner
the
end
will
be
our
legislature
is
now
in
session
with
plenty
of
work
provided
for
it
if
the
members
feel
it
consistent
or
necessary
to
attend
to
all
that
is
suggested
they
will
have
to
be
very
wary
and
prudent
or
our
ever
watchful
enemies
will
introduce
some
bills
that
if
enacted
will
prove
snares
and
pitfalls
they
will
have
to
work
for
nothing
for
congress
has
allowed
the
marshal
to
spend
the
appropriations
for
the
payment
of
the
legislature
and
passed
a
law
prohibiting
the
legislature
from
passing
any
act
to
pay
themselves
out
of
the
territorial
treasury
the
new
building
of
the
is
a
great
success
it
is
lighter
than
the
most
sanguine
expected
it
presents
now
that
the
elegent
front
is
on
a
most
handsome
and
imposing
appearance
we
expect
to
commence
business
in
it
about
the
of
march
my
health
is
generally
good
occasionally
i
catch
cold
and
then
i
suffer
from
rheumatism
i
hope
the
temple
at
george
will
be
sufficiently
near
completion
at
die
end
of
february
to
enable
me
to
go
down
at
that
time
and
dedicate
the
lower
portion
with
love
to
yourself
and
all
the
brethren
associated
with
you
and
with
constant
prayers
that
you
may
enjoy
all
the
blessings
that
in
your
heart
you
can
righteously
desire
and
that
abundant
success
may
crown
your
labors
i
remain
your
brother
in
the
gospel
brigham
young
i
did
very
well
with
my
saddle
work
earning
enough
to
assist
some
little
in
keeping
up
expenses
the
brethren
with
me
were
all
diligent
and
acted
in
a
manner
to
create
a
respect
for
our
people
and
religion
we
had
meetings
quite
often
on
the
american
side
of
the
river
that
were
generally
well
attended
and
good
order
prevailed
during
the
whole
winter
with
one
exception
we
were
informed
one
saturday
that
there
was
a
crowd
of
irish
catholics
that
intended
to
rotten
egg
us
the
next
day
sunday
if
we
attempted
to
preach
in
franklin
i
told
our
informers
that
we
expected
to
preach
and
hoped
the
irishmen
would
change
their
minds
there
was
an
old
acquaintance
of
mine
tom
massey
who
knew
me
in
santa
fe
tom
told
these
irishmen
that
he
did
not
know
what
religion
had
done
for
me
but
unless
it
had
done
more
than
is
common
they
would
not
meet
with
much
success
and
advised
them
not
to
try
it
massey
was
a
saloon
keeper
and
gambler
and
was
considered
authority
on
all
questions
that
had
to
be
settled
with
the
knife
and
pistol
and
i
think
his
advice
had
some
effect
however
next
morning
when
meeting
opened
there
was
quite
a
large
audience
about
the
time
i
commenced
speaking
the
irish
gents
came
in
sat
down
near
the
door
and
soon
began
groaning
i
walked
down
near
them
and
told
them
that
i
was
capable
of
making
all
the
noise
necessary
provided
the
audience
wished
to
hear
my
noise
but
if
they
preferred
theirs
to
mine
they
could
say
so
and
i
would
give
them
the
floor
several
in
the
audience
called
for
me
to
go
on
and
told
the
disturbers
to
keep
quiet
they
made
no
more
disturbance
this
gave
me
a
good
text
and
i
explained
plainly
the
gospel
of
repentance
referred
a
little
to
my
experience
in
that
country
when
a
boy
i
could
talk
plainly
as
there
were
persons
present
who
had
known
me
and
knew
that
i
was
rather
a
hard
case
in
a
fight
i
told
them
our
doctrine
required
us
to
forsake
all
of
our
evil
ways
and
to
be
willing
to
bear
all
kinds
of
persecution
meekly
that
i
had
endeavored
to
school
myself
in
these
principles
and
hoped
that
i
had
succeeded
but
that
i
was
not
quite
certain
yet
and
that
i
hoped
i
would
be
spared
the
trial
for
a
year
or
two
longer
before
having
to
be
thumped
for
my
religious
belief
as
i
might
not
be
prepared
to
take
abuse
with
a
submissive
spirit
in
explaining
mormonism
i
said
that
the
gospel
did
not
debar
a
person
from
any
pleasure
he
desired
to
enjoy
brothers
pratt
and
stewart
followed
and
spoke
on
the
first
principles
of
the
gospel
after
meeting
was
dismissed
the
leader
of
the
disturbers
met
us
at
the
door
he
asked
me
to
go
and
take
a
drink
with
him
i
told
him
i
did
not
drink
liquor
then
you
go
back
on
your
own
words
do
you
he
questioned
i
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
said
while
preaching
you
made
the
statement
that
your
religion
allowed
you
any
pleasure
you
desired
yes
sir
but
drinking
whisky
is
no
pleasure
to
me
and
i
do
not
desire
to
drink
any
well
do
you
ever
eat
anything
he
asked
yes
we
are
all
good
eaters
well
then
come
with
me
to
the
hotel
and
i
will
pay
for
a
good
dinner
for
as
many
of
you
as
will
come
brother
pratt
and
some
others
went
along
we
had
a
good
dinner
and
when
we
went
to
go
our
friend
said
if
any
body
bothers
you
let
me
know
and
i
will
lick
them
for
you
i
like
to
fight
but
would
rather
fight
for
you
boys
than
to
fight
you
good
bye
to
finish
this
some
ten
years
after
as
i
was
sitting
at
the
dinner
table
at
pueblo
colorado
i
noticed
a
man
looking
across
the
table
at
me
i
soon
recognized
him
as
my
irish
friend
i
spoke
and
asked
if
he
knew
me
yes
i
know
you
how
are
you
he
asked
reaching
across
the
table
and
shaking
hands
with
me
have
you
ever
thought
of
me
i
enquired
yes
a
thousand
times
i
told
him
i
had
often
thought
of
him
and
with
a
few
more
words
we
parted
i
feel
an
interest
now
in
this
man
and
would
be
glad
to
meet
him
again
and
know
his
name
i
can
say
that
i
have
often
observed
in
the
course
of
my
experience
that
every
man
even
the
worst
has
something
good
about
him
if
properly
treated
chapter
xxxix
justice
in
early
days
we
prepare
to
go
further
our
letter
of
introduction
loss
of
our
animals
we
trail
and
find
them
i
will
give
you
a
short
account
of
the
actions
of
the
first
authorities
of
franklin
as
given
to
me
by
the
main
actor
that
the
tenderfeet
of
the
present
day
may
know
a
little
of
the
experiences
of
early
days
when
franklin
first
established
itself
as
a
town
judge
jones
was
elected
mayor
and
ben
dowel
marshal
soon
after
organizing
a
number
of
roughs
came
in
and
started
to
run
the
town
defying
the
officers
this
would
have
been
all
right
and
possibly
admired
a
few
days
before
the
organization
but
now
order
must
be
kept
and
the
laws
vindicated
a
warrant
was
issued
and
the
marshal
and
posse
approached
the
rioters
a
man
was
killed
but
the
outlaws
kept
possession
of
the
street
and
defied
the
officers
something
had
to
be
done
the
dockets
show
that
these
men
were
arrested
brought
to
trial
and
found
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
that
the
court
sentenced
them
to
be
shot
that
ben
dowel
and
others
were
ordered
by
the
court
to
execute
the
orders
accordingly
the
orders
were
duly
executed
and
dowel
and
his
assistants
the
judge
being
one
of
the
party
proceeded
to
shoot
four
of
these
condemned
men
on
the
street
in
front
of
the
main
saloon
of
the
town
they
were
buried
as
the
records
show
and
the
costs
of
court
and
all
proceedings
duly
recorded
judge
jones
showed
me
the
record
and
explained
how
it
was
done
i
never
heard
any
complaint
about
the
proceedings
but
on
the
other
hand
judge
jones
and
ben
dowel
were
very
much
respected
by
the
average
citizens
of
the
country
during
the
winter
brothers
pratt
and
stewart
remained
most
of
the
time
at
ysleta
brother
ivins
helped
me
make
took
care
of
the
stock
and
made
himself
generally
useful
i
worked
most
of
the
time
in
the
shop
my
son
wiley
helping
me
we
boarded
with
a
mexican
family
santiago
vega
who
treated
us
very
kindly
often
posting
us
on
what
was
said
of
us
the
mexican
people
are
great
riders
and
fond
of
a
good
saddle
this
gave
me
a
chance
to
talk
to
the
people
all
seemed
friendly
even
the
priest
who
had
given
us
such
a
setting
up
came
and
patronized
us
we
also
distributed
a
few
books
we
tried
quite
hard
to
get
a
hearing
from
the
natives
that
lived
in
and
around
el
paso
but
the
priest
kept
such
a
watch
upon
our
moves
that
we
had
but
little
chance
these
natives
are
known
as
pueblos
never
having
mixed
with
the
spanish
blood
they
are
still
pure
blooded
indians
they
are
generally
poor
occupying
lands
owned
by
the
rich
they
desired
to
hear
us
and
appointed
meetings
but
were
warned
that
if
they
listened
to
us
their
rents
would
be
raised
or
they
would
be
driven
from
their
lands
so
we
had
to
let
them
alone
seeing
their
situation
the
brethren
held
meetings
often
at
ysleta
and
adjacent
towns
one
family
by
the
name
of
campbell
who
resided
at
san
elesario
opened
their
doors
to
the
elders
treating
them
with
great
kindness
this
family
afterwards
joined
the
church
after
recruiting
our
animals
and
feeling
that
we
had
done
about
all
the
good
in
our
power
in
el
paso
we
determined
to
make
a
move
into
the
interior
and
go
to
the
city
of
chihuahua
we
were
told
that
the
governor
senor
ochoa
was
a
very
man
and
not
under
priestly
control
and
that
he
would
be
very
likely
to
allow
us
the
privilege
of
preaching
i
wrote
to
president
young
regularly
we
received
letters
from
him
in
return
giving
us
kind
encouragement
and
instructions
i
reported
to
him
our
finances
which
were
getting
short
stating
that
we
intended
going
on
and
working
our
way
through
the
best
we
could
we
received
a
postal
card
directing
us
to
wait
till
we
heard
from
him
when
we
did
hear
it
was
in
the
shape
of
postal
orders
for
money
sufficient
to
bear
our
expenses
for
some
time
before
leaving
el
paso
i
called
on
the
jefe
politico
i
had
hoped
that
i
could
get
some
kind
of
a
letter
from
him
that
would
assist
us
in
getting
introduced
into
chihuahua
the
jefe
had
the
reputation
of
being
a
very
kind
and
affectionate
father
extremely
fond
of
his
wife
and
children
so
i
called
on
him
at
his
residence
he
received
me
kindly
and
expressed
regret
that
we
were
going
away
said
that
he
had
had
his
opinion
changed
about
the
mormons
from
the
way
in
which
your
company
have
acted
i
think
the
mormons
would
make
good
citizens
and
i
would
like
to
have
you
remain
i
told
him
our
duty
was
to
travel
through
the
country
and
visit
with
and
explain
to
the
people
our
principles
and
make
friends
with
them
in
anticipation
that
some
of
our
people
would
in
time
come
into
his
country
and
make
homes
that
they
were
now
coming
this
way
that
we
had
on
our
trip
found
country
and
reported
back
the
same
and
that
we
had
received
word
that
several
hundred
were
getting
ready
to
follow
upon
our
tracks
to
colonize
the
places
already
reported
well
said
he
all
you
will
have
to
do
will
be
to
do
as
you
have
done
here
when
you
first
came
we
all
thought
you
bad
men
you
have
stayed
here
and
behaved
yourselves
in
a
manner
that
we
now
look
on
you
as
good
men
and
respect
you
you
can
do
the
same
wherever
you
go
i
replied
yes
you
are
right
but
it
will
take
a
long
time
we
desire
to
visit
a
great
many
places
i
have
a
good
kind
wife
at
home
whom
i
love
dearly
i
have
a
number
of
little
children
near
the
ages
of
yours
here
i
love
them
they
are
fond
of
me
he
looked
at
me
a
moment
and
then
said
that
is
so
i
understand
your
feelings
and
will
give
you
a
letter
that
will
introduce
you
to
the
governor
or
wherever
you
go
and
you
do
not
need
to
wait
three
months
to
introduce
yourselves
he
gave
us
the
letter
stating
that
we
were
gentlemen
of
good
behavior
etc
we
bade
to
our
numerous
friends
and
started
to
chihuahua
in
the
latter
part
of
march
by
this
time
it
was
known
throughout
the
state
of
chihuahua
that
mormon
missionaries
were
in
the
country
the
reception
given
us
by
the
padre
had
also
been
heralded
abroad
this
caused
the
more
liberal
minded
to
sympathize
with
us
wherever
we
stayed
we
were
kindly
treated
we
managed
to
keep
posted
where
to
apply
and
who
to
avoid
the
liberal
people
notifying
us
against
the
rabid
catholics
the
first
day
travel
from
the
rio
grande
brought
us
to
a
station
where
water
was
supplied
in
a
large
tank
a
few
soldiers
were
stationed
here
as
a
guard
against
the
apaches
that
sometimes
raided
the
ranch
this
was
an
important
camping
place
being
the
only
water
found
on
a
mile
drive
grass
was
plentiful
and
travelers
often
camped
here
for
their
teams
to
rest
we
were
now
in
a
country
where
our
stock
would
have
to
be
carefully
watched
every
night
our
custom
was
to
feed
grain
hopple
the
horses
and
take
turns
guarding
them
through
the
night
it
was
my
turn
to
go
on
guard
the
animals
were
eating
their
corn
grass
was
good
all
around
the
camp
the
night
was
very
dark
the
brethren
were
singing
i
got
interested
in
listening
and
delayed
a
few
minutes
attending
to
the
stock
when
i
went
to
take
charge
of
them
they
were
all
gone
i
gave
the
alarm
one
man
remained
in
camp
to
keep
up
the
fire
and
the
rest
of
us
spent
until
midnight
hunting
but
nothing
of
our
stock
could
be
seen
i
went
to
bed
feeling
about
as
miserable
as
any
one
ever
did
the
fault
was
my
own
i
had
been
very
strict
so
much
so
that
some
of
the
brethren
had
felt
hurt
at
times
i
had
been
so
careful
of
all
our
outfit
now
i
felt
after
all
my
strictness
i
had
been
the
one
to
lose
the
stock
next
morning
we
could
see
bunches
of
stock
in
every
direction
but
ours
could
not
be
found
at
length
brother
ivins
and
my
son
found
their
trail
and
followed
it
some
ten
miles
they
were
afoot
and
the
trails
showed
that
the
animals
were
being
driven
off
so
the
boys
returned
and
reported
i
went
to
the
station
to
see
if
i
could
get
help
the
commander
said
it
was
his
business
to
lend
assistance
and
that
he
would
do
all
he
could
for
me
i
told
him
i
wanted
a
good
horse
as
i
was
a
trailer
the
commander
myself
and
two
others
were
ready
in
a
short
time
orders
were
given
for
five
others
to
follow
our
trail
bringing
water
and
provisions
we
went
to
our
camp
i
told
the
brethren
that
i
would
not
return
without
the
stock
the
commander
wanted
to
know
of
me
how
long
i
wished
to
follow
the
trail
i
told
him
until
i
got
the
animals
or
died
trying
he
said
he
never
left
a
trail
as
long
as
one
man
stayed
with
him
the
agreement
was
if
i
did
not
return
the
brethren
were
to
hire
a
team
return
to
el
paso
and
report
to
brother
brigham
as
soon
as
we
struck
the
trail
the
mexicans
decided
that
the
animals
had
been
stolen
by
apaches
as
we
could
see
plainly
that
there
were
barefooted
tracks
along
with
ours
the
trail
was
quite
plain
until
we
reached
a
low
mountain
range
here
the
formation
was
rocky
and
no
trail
could
be
seen
i
had
taken
the
lay
of
the
country
in
the
distance
and
picked
out
the
point
where
i
was
satisfied
the
animals
would
have
to
go
so
while
the
mexicans
were
looking
for
tracks
i
made
for
this
pass
on
reaching
the
summit
of
the
rise
the
country
opened
out
somewhat
level
i
made
a
circuit
and
soon
struck
the
trail
i
was
now
alone
but
on
calling
the
others
heard
me
and
soon
came
in
sight
i
started
on
a
gallop
one
of
the
party
riding
up
overtook
and
complimented
me
on
my
ability
to
trail
as
we
rode
i
looked
back
and
saw
a
signal
fire
i
asked
what
it
was
for
my
companion
said
the
captain
is
now
satisfied
that
the
apaches
have
your
stock
and
that
is
a
signal
fire
for
some
more
men
to
come
on
and
follow
our
trail
bringing
water
as
there
is
none
for
three
days
in
this
direction
he
proposed
riding
a
little
slower
till
the
captain
came
up
i
felt
more
like
going
faster
there
was
a
clump
of
cedars
in
sight
in
the
direction
we
were
going
as
we
neared
it
the
mexican
said
there
are
your
animals
the
thieves
have
gone
in
there
and
we
have
got
to
fight
we
looked
back
but
no
one
was
now
in
sight
the
mexican
asked
what
shall
we
do
will
you
fight
i
told
him
i
would
if
necessary
and
for
him
to
take
out
on
one
side
keeping
out
of
gun
shot
i
would
go
on
the
other
and
we
would
get
beyond
the
cedars
and
keep
the
thieves
from
running
the
stock
off
we
were
in
a
wide
flat
with
mountains
on
each
side
we
rode
clear
round
on
the
run
and
met
we
saw
no
sign
of
thieves
soon
five
men
with
the
mexican
captain
came
up
we
approached
the
cedars
cautiously
and
found
all
the
animals
bunched
but
no
thieves
we
made
a
careful
survey
of
the
country
and
found
the
tracks
of
the
thieves
where
they
had
gone
off
in
another
direction
the
captain
asked
if
i
wished
to
follow
them
i
was
too
thankful
to
get
the
stock
so
i
told
him
to
let
them
go
that
they
had
had
their
trouble
for
nothing
we
arrived
at
our
camp
about
sundown
having
ridden
nearly
forty
miles
the
commander
charged
us
nothing
but
we
made
the
soldiers
a
present
of
a
few
dollars
which
they
accepted
very
thankfully
as
a
mexican
soldier
serves
for
almost
nothing
and
boards
himself
our
animals
were
never
molested
afterward
there
was
quite
a
number
of
teams
camped
around
at
the
time
and
there
was
considerable
interest
shown
as
most
all
thought
it
was
the
apaches
that
had
stolen
our
animals
but
it
was
doubtless
thieves
who
had
taken
them
expecting
to
get
a
reward
for
fetching
them
back
when
we
returned
the
captain
told
them
it
was
no
use
for
any
one
to
steal
my
animals
unless
they
rolled
up
the
tracks
as
they
went
along
for
if
they
did
not
i
would
find
them
and
added
that
the
mormon
was
the
best
trailer
he
had
ever
seen
months
after
this
when
hundreds
of
miles
from
this
place
mexicans
would
speak
of
the
circumstance
and
quote
the
words
of
the
captain
we
were
something
strange
in
the
country
and
all
our
movements
and
actions
were
watched
and
talked
about
so
that
wherever
we
went
we
found
the
people
seemed
to
know
all
about
us
chapter
xl
the
object
of
our
mission
our
arrival
at
chihuahua
our
generous
landlord
we
call
on
the
governor
interest
aroused
concerning
us
interview
with
robbers
before
writing
any
further
account
of
our
travels
and
experiences
in
mexico
i
will
explain
as
briefly
as
i
can
the
cause
of
the
mission
being
called
and
the
expectations
entertained
by
many
the
book
of
mormon
teaches
us
that
the
gospel
is
to
be
carried
to
the
remnants
that
is
the
natives
of
america
indians
the
promise
is
that
the
natives
will
receive
the
gospel
and
rejoice
in
it
the
census
of
mexico
shows
that
there
are
over
six
millions
of
pure
blooded
indians
or
descendants
of
the
ancient
races
inhabiting
this
country
now
when
this
mission
was
opened
a
great
many
became
enthusiastic
over
the
prospects
and
expected
great
things
of
us
the
first
missionaries
to
mexico
i
remember
writing
to
my
wife
while
in
el
paso
referring
to
this
spirit
telling
her
that
many
would
be
disappointed
in
the
mission
but
that
i
should
not
that
i
should
be
satisfied
even
if
we
did
not
baptize
a
single
person
that
our
mission
was
more
as
prospectors
going
through
to
prepare
the
way
and
that
president
young
so
understood
it
we
were
to
be
governed
by
circumstances
and
not
to
feel
disappointed
if
we
could
get
to
distribute
our
books
and
learn
about
the
country
and
make
friendly
acquaintance
with
the
people
that
was
all
that
would
be
expected
of
us
on
the
trip
this
was
our
calling
we
were
not
sent
to
baptize
and
organize
branches
neither
were
we
forbidden
to
do
so
that
was
an
open
question
to
be
decided
upon
according
to
the
openings
made
there
were
two
parties
in
mexico
the
catholics
and
liberals
we
kept
our
eyes
open
for
the
latter
as
we
were
always
safe
with
them
when
we
reached
the
city
of
chihuahua
i
desired
to
find
a
stopping
place
with
a
liberal
the
liberals
of
mexico
believe
in
religious
liberty
please
do
think
they
were
like
utah
liberals
we
did
not
wish
to
seem
partial
to
either
and
did
not
like
to
make
a
direct
enquiry
i
was
well
acquainted
with
the
old
customs
of
this
place
having
lived
there
for
some
time
so
we
drove
up
near
the
catholic
cathedral
i
knew
that
any
good
catholic
passing
in
front
of
the
church
would
take
off
his
hat
but
a
liberal
would
pass
along
with
his
hat
on
in
when
i
was
there
had
to
take
off
their
hats
or
run
the
risk
of
getting
a
good
pelting
with
rocks
but
it
was
not
the
case
in
the
time
i
am
now
writing
about
i
soon
noticed
a
large
man
coming
along
who
did
not
raise
his
hat
i
asked
him
to
direct
us
to
a
good
maison
or
hostelry
i
felt
sure
he
would
send
me
to
the
right
place
which
he
did
to
the
maison
san
francisco
a
maison
is
a
large
building
with
rooms
corrals
and
stabling
where
you
can
rent
accommodations
and
sustain
yourself
generally
with
stores
of
provisions
kept
by
the
proprietor
to
sell
to
travelers
connected
on
arriving
and
taking
rooms
and
stables
i
went
to
the
landlord
and
told
him
we
had
left
our
money
at
el
paso
to
be
expressed
to
us
and
we
wished
him
to
credit
us
for
a
few
days
for
such
provisions
and
feed
as
we
needed
he
said
no
sir
i
will
not
do
that
i
was
stumped
and
did
not
know
what
to
do
as
we
had
but
a
few
dollars
with
us
our
outfit
was
first
class
and
valuable
and
we
had
not
expected
to
be
refused
while
i
was
wondering
in
my
mind
what
to
do
the
landlord
stepped
into
a
room
and
soon
returned
with
a
large
pocket
book
and
handed
it
to
me
saying
there
is
money
take
what
you
want
and
when
yours
comes
you
can
return
it
if
i
should
sell
you
things
on
credit
you
might
think
i
took
advantage
of
your
circumstances
and
charge
you
more
than
if
you
had
money
take
what
money
you
want
look
around
and
buy
where
you
can
do
the
best
i
thought
how
very
different
from
the
average
white
man
whether
gentile
or
mormon
the
landlord
proved
a
true
gentleman
in
every
respect
giving
us
much
useful
information
and
treating
us
kindly
during
our
stay
as
soon
as
we
got
cleaned
up
and
rested
a
little
we
called
upon
the
governor
and
presented
the
letter
received
from
the
jefe
politico
of
el
paso
he
received
us
kindly
saying
that
he
had
heard
about
us
and
laughingly
said
he
had
heard
of
padre
borajo
speech
and
hoped
we
were
not
so
bad
as
the
padre
had
represented
us
to
be
governor
ochoa
was
an
intelligent
man
and
was
much
respected
his
name
is
still
held
in
respectful
remembrance
in
chihuahua
he
was
known
to
be
truthful
and
honest
he
was
quite
learned
and
understood
well
the
condition
of
mexico
after
explaining
our
reasons
to
him
for
visiting
mexico
he
said
he
was
glad
to
have
us
come
among
them
that
he
believed
our
principles
taught
to
the
people
would
do
them
good
he
also
said
that
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
lands
of
mexico
and
would
give
us
all
the
information
he
could
to
help
us
understand
them
properly
so
we
could
report
correctly
to
brigham
young
the
governor
recommended
us
to
the
jefe
politico
of
chihuahua
who
furnished
us
the
public
cockpit
to
preach
in
printed
notices
were
circulated
the
editor
of
the
official
paper
gave
us
a
favorable
notice
in
the
evening
at
the
time
of
meeting
quite
a
respectable
congregation
had
gathered
the
cock
fighting
was
still
going
on
but
soon
closed
many
persons
there
at
their
national
sport
remained
to
hear
us
as
i
was
the
only
one
who
could
speak
in
spanish
brother
tenney
having
gone
north
i
had
to
do
the
preaching
it
was
quite
a
task
but
i
knew
the
native
politeness
no
mexican
will
ever
jeer
a
foreigner
if
he
tries
to
speak
their
language
they
will
listen
attentively
and
try
to
understand
i
understood
spanish
quite
well
but
had
never
spoken
in
public
and
no
doubt
made
many
blunders
however
our
audience
seemed
pleased
when
meeting
was
over
many
came
and
shook
hands
with
us
and
said
they
liked
what
had
been
preached
one
aged
blind
man
who
had
held
a
discussion
with
the
bishop
of
durango
said
he
had
been
preaching
our
doctrine
for
years
he
showed
us
a
report
of
his
discussion
the
old
fellow
although
very
poor
had
made
a
name
that
is
known
far
and
wide
no
one
could
answer
him
he
came
to
our
rooms
next
day
and
talked
for
a
long
while
we
gave
him
some
of
our
books
to
distribute
he
lived
at
jabonero
southwest
from
chihuahua
some
two
hundred
miles
he
said
the
honest
people
of
mexico
would
believe
our
words
the
old
man
manifested
a
great
desire
to
have
us
go
to
his
town
i
have
never
heard
of
him
since
but
we
were
all
impressed
with
his
honesty
by
invitation
we
visited
gov
ochoa
several
times
he
explained
fully
to
us
the
condition
of
government
lands
he
said
the
mexican
government
made
big
offers
of
land
to
colonizers
but
the
fact
was
they
had
no
good
land
that
all
desirable
tracts
for
settling
were
covered
by
old
grants
with
titles
he
desired
us
to
say
to
brigham
young
that
if
he
wanted
lands
for
his
people
they
must
be
bought
from
the
owners
and
for
him
not
to
be
deceived
by
any
offers
coming
from
the
government
of
mexico
he
said
their
offers
were
polite
and
looked
pretty
on
paper
and
sounded
well
when
listened
to
and
he
really
believed
that
if
they
could
do
as
they
offered
to
they
would
the
mexicans
are
naturally
kind
and
polite
but
inasmuch
as
they
have
neither
land
or
money
he
said
laughingly
you
must
take
the
will
for
the
deed
this
i
reported
to
prest
young
on
my
return
home
who
received
it
as
a
fact
and
remarked
why
should
there
be
good
lands
left
in
the
heart
of
mexico
when
they
had
given
out
grants
clear
into
california
new
mexico
arizona
and
even
into
this
territory
we
remained
some
three
weeks
in
the
city
a
great
many
persons
called
upon
us
some
to
enquire
about
our
religion
with
sincere
interest
others
for
mere
curiosity
among
our
visitors
were
some
notorious
robbers
from
arizona
who
visited
us
often
we
could
not
avoid
them
as
they
passed
for
gentlemen
and
really
acted
as
such
one
was
a
small
dutchman
who
seemed
to
know
all
about
the
big
mail
robbery
on
the
southern
route
in
as
also
about
the
robbing
of
golinsky
of
silver
city
the
other
was
a
young
man
from
silver
city
who
robbed
an
old
dutchman
of
some
fifteen
hundred
dollars
not
far
from
mecilla
while
they
were
traveling
together
the
old
man
had
been
to
california
for
five
years
had
mortgaged
his
farm
or
bought
it
with
a
mortgage
given
as
security
he
had
saved
the
money
to
pay
up
and
was
on
the
way
home
full
of
joy
to
meet
his
wife
and
children
he
had
traveled
all
the
way
from
california
on
horseback
and
alone
not
even
a
pocket
pistol
to
protect
himself
he
carried
a
fifteen
hundred
draft
and
some
little
money
he
looked
quite
poor
no
one
would
have
suspected
him
worth
robbing
this
young
man
got
in
company
with
the
old
fellow
and
they
traveled
and
camped
together
the
dutchman
confided
his
good
luck
to
the
lad
who
could
not
stand
the
temptation
but
made
the
old
man
give
up
the
boy
rode
ahead
and
got
across
the
line
changed
his
draft
and
skipped
we
saw
both
while
in
el
paso
the
old
man
came
in
hunting
the
robber
where
we
heard
his
story
the
young
fellow
told
my
son
wiley
all
about
the
job
and
expressed
himself
sorry
saying
he
was
of
good
family
but
was
now
ruined
for
life
in
talking
to
the
people
we
found
that
many
adhered
to
and
respected
their
ancient
traditions
they
also
retained
a
respect
for
their
native
lineage
this
spirit
prevailed
strongest
among
the
liberals
the
power
of
catholicism
had
been
broken
and
a
new
constitution
adopted
under
the
leadership
of
juarez
who
had
overcome
maximilian
juarez
was
a
pureblooded
indian
his
most
active
helpers
and
the
main
portion
of
his
army
were
composed
of
natives
so
at
the
time
we
were
there
it
was
respectable
to
be
called
indigine
or
native
this
class
received
the
book
of
mormon
readily
and
manifested
much
interest
in
the
same
while
in
chihuahua
we
sent
out
copies
of
the
book
five
in
a
package
to
each
town
and
city
throughout
the
republic
wherever
there
was
a
mail
the
clerks
in
the
post
office
assisted
us
for
three
days
all
their
spare
time
they
were
packing
and
directing
each
package
was
directed
to
the
officers
of
the
place
with
a
request
to
read
and
distribute
them
among
the
people
we
sent
to
all
the
head
officers
of
the
different
departments
a
package
i
received
letters
of
acknowledgment
from
some
of
the
principal
men
among
the
rest
altamarano
a
native
and
a
high
officer
of
state
i
got
several
letters
from
doctor
rodacanaty
professing
to
have
had
a
vision
showing
him
the
truth
of
the
book
of
mormon
chapter
xli
we
decided
to
visit
guerero
meetings
at
concepcion
we
prepare
to
return
home
the
priest
at
temosachic
his
kindness
to
us
testimony
of
a
stranger
after
finishing
up
our
work
in
the
city
of
chihuahua
we
decided
to
visit
the
western
portion
of
the
state
we
had
received
information
that
a
great
many
natives
lived
in
the
canton
de
guerero
this
district
commences
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
west
of
the
city
of
chihuahua
and
extends
into
the
sierra
madre
mountains
the
greater
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
guerero
are
natives
known
as
tarumarie
many
villages
of
these
people
are
located
in
the
valleys
near
the
mountains
there
are
many
towns
and
villages
that
retain
the
old
indian
names
towns
that
were
there
when
the
spaniards
first
came
into
the
country
have
come
under
catholic
rule
cathedrals
were
built
and
a
few
spaniards
settled
among
the
people
mixing
with
them
in
some
settlements
most
of
the
mixed
blood
claim
relationship
to
the
in
this
way
spanish
civilization
somewhat
modified
the
habits
of
the
people
but
did
not
do
away
with
them
entirely
for
in
most
of
these
towns
pure
tarumaries
inhabit
districts
retaining
all
their
ancient
customs
and
language
this
race
of
people
are
much
respected
throughout
the
state
of
chihuahua
and
it
is
considered
rather
an
honor
to
be
related
to
them
we
concluded
to
make
their
country
our
next
stopping
place
bidding
to
our
friends
in
chihuahua
and
particularly
to
our
good
old
honest
governor
antonio
ochoa
we
started
west
our
route
led
through
a
country
that
was
very
sparsely
settled
owing
to
the
lack
of
water
for
irrigation
the
city
of
chihuahua
is
located
in
a
rough
barren
country
which
continues
for
some
miles
going
west
for
several
days
travel
there
is
nothing
very
inviting
to
the
eye
but
on
reaching
the
higher
country
toward
the
head
waters
of
the
aras
river
a
tributary
of
the
yaqui
the
country
became
more
inviting
we
continued
our
journey
passing
settlements
and
ranches
daily
leaving
with
each
a
few
books
and
talking
a
little
with
the
people
near
where
we
camped
nothing
of
importance
occurred
on
the
road
except
the
mending
of
one
of
our
horse
hoofs
with
rawhide
the
hoof
had
been
badly
cracked
for
some
time
as
we
were
descending
a
rough
rocky
hill
the
horse
stumbled
and
struck
his
foot
against
a
boulder
so
hard
that
the
hoof
split
clear
open
up
to
the
hair
we
had
much
difficulty
in
getting
him
into
the
settlement
a
few
miles
ahead
we
offered
to
sell
the
horse
but
could
get
only
one
dollar
offered
for
him
we
could
not
well
leave
him
neither
had
we
money
to
spare
to
buy
another
mexicans
are
great
people
to
use
rawhide
and
i
had
learned
from
them
to
use
it
in
many
emergencies
as
we
were
going
to
bed
brother
pratt
remarked
brother
jones
why
ca
you
use
rawhide
on
john
the
horse
or
does
this
case
beat
you
the
question
put
me
to
thinking
so
in
the
morning
i
obtained
a
suitable
piece
of
rawhide
from
a
mexican
took
the
horse
to
a
blacksmith
who
put
some
tallow
and
burnt
horn
into
the
opening
of
the
hoof
then
seared
it
with
a
hot
iron
i
then
took
the
rawhide
and
fitted
it
nicely
over
the
whole
hoof
lacing
it
behind
and
underneath
the
blacksmith
fitted
a
shoe
and
nailed
it
on
driving
the
nails
through
the
rawhide
which
now
formed
the
outer
crust
of
the
hoof
we
let
the
horse
stand
in
a
dry
place
until
the
next
morning
when
the
nails
were
tightly
clinched
we
laid
over
one
day
to
see
how
this
would
work
then
continued
our
journey
the
horse
traveled
as
though
nothing
had
happened
and
finally
when
the
hide
came
off
after
we
had
traveled
some
six
hundred
miles
the
hoof
was
entirely
healed
up
this
may
not
be
interesting
but
might
be
profitable
to
some
and
for
that
reason
i
relate
the
circumstance
on
arriving
at
the
village
of
concepcion
the
principal
town
of
guerero
we
enquired
for
a
good
place
to
stop
and
were
directed
to
don
eselso
gonzalez
where
we
soon
made
arrangements
for
the
necessary
accommodations
don
eselso
furnished
us
good
quarters
with
a
large
hall
attached
had
it
seated
with
benches
brought
from
the
bull
pen
which
he
owned
we
held
several
meetings
that
were
well
attended
and
much
interest
was
manifested
by
some
while
all
treated
us
kindly
one
man
francisco
rubio
really
understood
and
believed
the
book
of
mormon
as
once
in
meeting
he
took
it
in
his
hand
and
explained
it
in
a
more
lucid
manner
especially
the
part
relating
to
the
savior
appearance
on
this
continent
than
i
had
ever
heard
before
individually
i
received
new
light
from
the
native
from
what
i
have
seen
now
and
then
among
the
natives
i
sometimes
think
that
the
people
called
saints
are
only
half
converted
i
have
seen
and
felt
more
warmth
of
spirit
and
faith
manifested
by
natives
than
i
ever
saw
by
white
saints
even
the
apaches
told
me
that
they
would
not
wait
long
for
the
scene
when
they
once
had
power
and
authority
from
god
to
act
in
his
name
that
faith
which
will
yet
remove
the
powers
of
evil
from
around
the
saints
will
come
largely
from
the
remnants
i
think
we
will
need
them
in
our
work
and
should
be
looking
after
them
some
little
and
not
altogether
after
money
we
deposited
our
money
with
don
eselso
many
times
getting
articles
from
his
store
and
when
we
went
to
settle
up
for
house
rent
and
other
things
he
would
not
take
a
cent
but
insisted
on
presenting
us
with
some
dried
meat
and
other
stuff
jokingly
remarking
that
he
could
not
sell
it
anyway
while
here
we
visited
arisiachic
the
principal
tarumarie
town
the
trail
was
very
difficult
we
were
well
received
the
chief
called
the
people
together
and
we
had
a
long
talk
with
them
they
were
very
much
pleased
with
our
visit
and
hoped
we
would
return
some
day
we
remained
in
concepcion
about
three
weeks
held
several
meetings
which
were
well
attended
many
people
visited
us
to
learn
of
our
doctrine
we
were
fully
convinced
that
many
believed
in
the
truth
of
the
book
of
mormon
yet
we
had
no
spirit
to
offer
baptism
by
this
time
some
of
the
brethren
began
to
manifest
a
desire
to
return
home
at
first
i
felt
a
little
disappointed
but
i
can
look
back
now
and
see
that
our
mission
was
properly
a
short
one
we
were
united
in
one
idea
and
that
was
before
any
great
work
could
be
done
in
this
country
it
would
be
necessary
to
colonize
among
the
people
as
to
the
spirit
of
the
people
we
all
agreed
also
that
it
was
favorable
so
it
was
deemed
best
that
we
work
our
way
toward
home
visiting
the
various
settlements
on
our
way
we
left
many
friends
at
concepcion
some
testifying
to
having
a
perfect
faith
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
expressing
a
strong
desire
that
the
mormons
would
come
and
dwell
among
them
on
our
way
home
we
turned
off
from
the
road
at
tejoloquechic
west
to
visit
the
towns
of
matachic
and
temosachic
the
last
a
place
containing
some
five
thousand
inhabitants
the
people
of
these
towns
received
us
not
only
kindly
but
many
of
them
manifested
great
faith
in
our
teachings
they
often
insisted
on
giving
us
something
for
our
books
saying
we
had
a
long
way
to
travel
and
would
need
something
to
help
us
on
our
journey
at
matachic
tomas
tribosa
opened
his
house
to
us
and
we
had
a
large
congregation
we
talked
freely
and
plainly
to
the
people
many
persons
had
told
us
that
we
would
be
all
right
so
long
as
we
let
the
subject
of
polygamy
alone
but
if
that
was
ever
taught
the
women
would
knife
us
this
night
while
speaking
i
felt
impressed
to
talk
on
the
principle
of
plurality
and
explain
plainly
the
doctrine
there
were
quite
a
number
of
women
present
after
meeting
was
dismissed
i
went
to
the
end
of
the
hall
where
the
women
were
many
of
them
came
and
shook
hands
with
me
and
said
they
would
rather
their
husbands
would
do
as
we
taught
than
as
many
of
them
did
no
one
seemed
offended
in
the
least
wherever
we
held
meetings
permission
had
to
be
first
obtained
from
the
civil
authorities
when
we
arrived
at
temosachic
the
proper
officer
for
granting
this
license
was
out
of
town
a
man
was
sent
four
miles
for
him
it
not
being
certain
whether
he
would
be
found
or
not
while
we
were
arranging
to
send
a
courier
the
priest
of
the
settlement
came
up
he
expressed
the
hope
that
we
would
be
able
to
find
the
officer
said
he
desired
very
much
to
hear
us
and
asked
if
the
padre
at
chihuahua
had
offered
his
church
to
us
i
told
him
he
had
not
he
said
he
wished
he
had
set
the
example
then
he
himself
could
invite
us
into
his
church
where
a
license
would
not
be
required
but
he
did
not
like
to
risk
being
the
first
to
open
a
catholic
church
building
to
us
but
said
he
you
must
come
down
tonight
it
was
now
about
noon
and
i
will
have
a
good
lot
of
my
people
together
there
is
no
law
against
friends
sitting
down
and
talking
on
a
decent
subject
i
want
to
ask
some
few
questions
if
you
will
answer
them
i
replied
that
we
would
come
we
conversed
for
some
time
and
the
padre
seemed
quite
interested
we
were
camped
some
three
miles
away
at
the
edge
of
the
town
about
sundown
brother
pratt
and
i
walked
down
to
the
public
square
where
we
had
appointed
to
meet
the
priest
we
felt
as
safe
as
if
at
home
in
salt
lake
city
on
arriving
the
priest
and
quite
an
audience
were
awaiting
us
but
there
was
no
word
from
the
officer
so
we
concluded
to
sit
and
chat
a
great
many
pertinent
questions
were
asked
and
answered
the
best
of
order
prevailed
and
a
good
feeling
was
manifested
the
priest
said
he
would
study
our
book
and
if
he
could
not
understand
it
he
was
willing
for
his
people
to
study
and
if
they
could
see
good
in
our
doctrine
he
wanted
them
to
have
the
privilege
of
receiving
it
he
said
that
he
was
now
getting
old
that
he
had
always
worked
for
the
good
of
the
people
and
that
he
did
not
want
to
keep
any
good
thing
away
from
them
next
morning
we
started
back
to
take
up
our
road
for
home
we
had
turned
off
at
tejoloquechic
on
reaching
there
the
people
had
gathered
a
donation
of
corn
and
beans
for
us
and
insisted
on
our
receiving
it
we
took
some
but
told
them
we
could
not
haul
much
the
next
place
where
anything
of
interest
occurred
was
at
namaquipe
a
town
on
the
upper
santa
maria
river
we
arrived
at
this
place
on
sunday
about
ten
intending
to
spend
the
day
of
rest
there
we
camped
in
the
shade
of
some
cottonwoods
near
a
large
ranch
house
across
the
river
from
the
main
town
i
went
to
the
house
to
buy
some
dried
meat
i
met
an
old
lady
who
sold
me
the
meat
giving
quite
a
liberal
quantity
for
twenty
five
cents
i
made
her
a
present
of
one
of
our
books
and
went
back
to
camp
some
time
after
noon
this
same
lady
with
a
very
aged
companion
came
into
camp
the
old
man
looked
over
one
hundred
years
old
we
learned
that
he
was
a
hundred
and
three
years
on
being
seated
the
old
gentleman
said
you
were
up
to
my
house
this
morning
yes
sir
you
got
some
meat
yes
sir
you
paid
for
it
yes
sir
i
began
to
think
of
the
i
had
gotten
for
my
money
you
left
a
little
book
yes
sir
did
you
get
pay
for
it
no
sir
i
did
not
want
pay
for
the
book
we
do
not
sell
these
books
yes
but
you
paid
for
the
meat
that
was
not
right
here
the
old
man
held
the
book
up
and
said
i
have
been
reading
this
book
i
understand
it
and
know
who
you
are
you
are
apostles
of
jesus
christ
just
the
same
as
peter
james
and
john
and
i
know
it
and
i
also
know
this
book
is
true
he
then
turned
to
his
wife
and
said
wife
have
i
not
been
telling
our
neighbors
for
two
years
past
that
apostles
having
the
true
gospel
would
come
to
this
land
and
that
i
would
live
to
see
them
we
were
astonished
to
hear
this
testimony
so
direct
and
positive
don
francisco
vasquez
continued
and
asked
us
if
we
intended
to
return
to
the
country
soon
we
told
him
we
did
not
know
but
we
hoped
to
he
said
he
would
like
to
be
baptized
and
receive
the
benefit
of
the
gospel
before
he
died
next
morning
when
we
passed
his
home
he
made
us
take
four
sacks
of
corn
all
we
could
haul
the
old
man
lived
to
be
one
hundred
and
five
years
old
i
visited
his
family
ten
years
afterwards
the
old
lady
was
still
alive
she
told
me
that
don
francisco
on
his
called
his
family
around
him
and
told
them
all
to
be
baptized
when
the
mormons
came
some
forty
persons
agreed
to
do
so
his
oldest
son
told
me
the
same
they
were
still
hopeful
but
how
long
their
hopes
will
hold
out
i
can
not
say
possibly
until
the
liberals
drive
us
out
of
this
land
into
mexico
where
the
greater
number
of
the
remnants
live
then
and
not
till
then
will
we
feel
the
obligation
of
carrying
the
words
of
the
book
of
mormon
to
the
lamanites
many
times
when
thinking
of
this
old
man
and
others
of
the
district
i
have
cried
like
a
child
never
having
seen
from
that
day
to
the
present
any
disposition
manifested
to
continue
a
mission
in
that
part
of
the
country
of
late
years
i
have
concluded
that
the
people
are
better
as
they
are
than
they
would
be
unless
those
going
among
them
go
with
the
spirit
of
true
friends
and
as
colonizing
missionaries
chapter
xlii
experience
at
el
valle
we
travel
through
a
dangerous
indian
country
soldiers
on
the
move
visit
from
an
old
timer
after
leaving
namaquipe
the
the
next
place
of
importance
is
el
valle
we
arrived
about
noon
and
halted
on
the
public
square
we
saw
a
large
crowd
collected
at
a
corner
store
i
took
a
tin
can
and
told
the
brethren
that
if
we
could
not
get
the
privilege
of
preaching
here
i
would
get
some
lard
and
we
would
move
on
the
crowd
was
watching
us
as
i
approached
them
i
could
see
that
something
special
was
up
i
went
into
the
store
and
inquired
where
i
could
find
the
alcalde
a
man
asked
what
do
you
want
with
him
i
want
to
get
permission
to
preach
here
i
can
answer
that
you
can
not
we
have
all
the
religion
we
want
we
have
held
a
mass
meeting
and
the
citizens
of
this
place
have
appointed
me
to
meet
you
on
your
arrival
and
notify
you
that
you
can
go
on
we
know
who
you
are
and
want
nothing
to
do
with
you
i
made
no
reply
but
turned
to
the
merchant
and
asked
him
if
he
had
any
lard
at
this
many
of
the
crowd
commenced
to
laugh
and
make
pleasant
remarks
saying
that
the
stranger
took
it
very
coolly
the
merchant
said
he
was
out
of
lard
and
did
not
know
of
anyone
who
had
any
but
don
pedro
who
had
been
talking
to
me
i
asked
him
if
he
would
sell
me
some
yes
sir
but
it
is
quite
a
distance
from
here
to
my
house
if
you
wish
to
go
so
far
with
me
i
will
let
you
have
what
you
want
all
right
i
will
go
with
you
when
we
started
most
of
the
crowd
followed
don
pedro
commenced
talking
in
a
very
earnest
manner
telling
me
that
they
had
just
received
a
letter
from
the
pope
warning
all
catholics
against
false
prophets
and
that
they
were
all
fully
prepared
beforehand
to
reject
our
heresies
he
kept
up
his
talk
until
we
arrived
at
his
house
he
now
got
a
pamphlet
and
commenced
reading
this
was
the
printed
circular
of
the
pope
i
listened
patiently
until
my
opponent
finished
the
house
a
large
one
was
crowded
nearly
a
hundred
persons
present
i
now
asked
permission
to
answer
the
pope
letter
and
explain
our
side
don
pedro
objected
my
reply
settled
him
i
told
him
i
had
been
much
in
mexico
and
mixed
among
the
people
a
great
deal
and
i
had
always
found
them
mannerly
and
polite
especially
to
strangers
and
in
their
own
house
that
i
was
now
under
his
roof
and
protection
a
stranger
and
appealed
to
him
as
a
true
mexican
gentleman
to
hear
me
at
this
many
of
the
crowd
said
let
the
stranger
speak
don
pedro
now
consented
but
soon
interrupted
me
i
reminded
him
that
i
had
listened
to
him
in
perfect
silence
and
unless
he
did
the
same
i
should
claim
to
be
more
of
a
gentleman
than
he
was
this
made
quite
a
laugh
and
the
voice
was
for
me
to
have
the
floor
uninterruptedly
in
brief
i
will
say
that
i
fully
satisfied
myself
spoke
with
perfect
freedom
and
handled
the
priests
and
pope
without
gloves
when
i
got
through
don
pedro
said
his
whole
opinion
was
now
changed
asked
for
a
book
saying
he
would
read
and
study
it
whether
the
priests
liked
it
or
not
when
we
left
all
was
friendly
the
district
of
country
we
had
been
passing
through
appeared
to
be
the
most
desirable
for
colonizing
we
made
diligent
enquiries
about
lands
titles
conflicting
water
interests
and
making
notes
all
of
which
were
reported
to
prest
young
on
our
arrival
home
as
we
neared
the
frontier
settlements
there
was
great
excitement
as
the
apaches
were
out
on
the
war
path
and
had
killed
some
men
near
fort
bowie
they
had
had
a
fight
with
the
soldiers
and
whipped
them
and
were
now
raiding
the
country
in
every
direction
some
of
the
officials
at
galiana
talked
of
stopping
us
from
going
any
further
but
we
were
very
anxious
to
continue
on
so
we
told
them
we
would
be
careful
and
not
run
into
danger
after
leaving
casas
grandes
our
road
was
really
lonesome
and
dangerous
it
was
some
three
days
travel
to
cow
springs
before
we
would
see
a
ranch
however
we
made
the
trip
without
accident
traveling
the
most
dangerous
parts
in
the
night
time
one
night
we
had
our
nerves
sorely
tried
my
intention
was
if
we
ever
met
the
apaches
to
approach
them
alone
believing
i
could
make
peace
with
them
the
same
as
i
had
done
before
with
other
indians
while
traveling
along
one
night
brother
ivins
and
my
son
riding
ahead
of
the
wagon
our
little
watch
dog
that
had
been
of
great
service
to
us
many
times
gave
notice
that
someone
was
approaching
in
the
road
i
called
to
the
boys
to
stop
i
went
and
got
on
my
son
horse
telling
him
to
go
back
to
the
team
brother
ivins
and
i
rode
on
a
short
distance
the
night
was
rather
dark
but
soon
we
saw
a
lot
of
what
appeared
to
be
indians
coming
they
were
on
foot
and
armed
they
halted
on
seeing
us
i
told
brother
ivins
to
go
back
to
the
wagon
and
i
would
go
and
meet
them
and
if
they
shot
me
he
and
the
others
must
jump
into
the
brush
and
try
and
save
their
lives
as
best
they
could
i
got
off
from
my
horse
and
walked
up
to
the
indians
who
stood
in
a
group
filling
the
road
as
i
approached
alone
they
did
not
seem
to
make
any
move
whatever
i
spoke
saluting
them
in
spanish
they
answered
all
right
i
offered
them
my
hand
and
they
all
shook
hands
with
me
i
asked
them
where
they
were
going
they
said
down
to
their
homes
and
asked
where
i
was
going
i
told
them
i
was
going
to
my
home
a
long
way
off
in
the
northern
country
thus
we
kept
asking
and
answering
questions
till
one
asked
why
we
were
traveling
by
night
i
told
them
that
my
companions
were
afraid
of
them
but
that
i
was
not
for
i
was
a
friend
to
the
indians
and
did
not
believe
they
would
ever
kill
me
they
began
to
laugh
and
asked
me
who
i
thought
they
were
i
asked
are
you
not
apaches
no
senor
we
are
not
apaches
they
answered
but
like
you
we
are
traveling
in
the
night
because
we
are
afraid
of
them
i
now
called
to
my
companions
who
had
been
waiting
in
suspense
all
my
bravery
and
fortitude
were
wasted
further
than
to
prove
to
myself
that
i
was
willing
to
stand
the
test
we
had
a
good
long
talk
with
these
indians
who
were
of
the
opitas
a
people
similar
to
the
pimas
and
who
live
in
the
foothills
of
the
sierra
madre
in
sonora
as
we
neared
the
frontier
ranches
on
the
american
side
we
found
that
the
apache
war
was
a
reality
we
camped
at
cow
springs
much
apprehension
was
felt
at
burro
sienega
here
we
met
connor
whom
we
had
met
on
the
trip
down
his
father
and
brother
were
killed
shortly
after
at
this
ranch
we
heard
that
soldiers
were
concentrating
at
bowie
with
orders
to
capture
and
take
all
the
apaches
to
the
san
carlos
reservation
apache
signal
fires
could
be
seen
in
the
mountains
south
of
bowie
our
route
now
led
through
the
most
perilous
part
of
the
country
hundreds
of
people
having
been
killed
along
this
road
in
past
years
our
feelings
were
to
put
our
trust
in
god
and
go
on
we
arrived
at
san
simon
where
a
lot
of
hard
cases
were
camped
it
was
a
question
whether
we
were
safer
with
them
than
alone
but
they
were
afraid
and
felt
better
while
we
were
with
them
next
day
was
the
teller
if
we
could
make
bowie
all
right
our
chances
would
be
better
from
there
on
as
troops
were
en
route
to
that
post
from
camps
verde
mcdowell
and
apache
our
travel
from
san
simon
to
bowie
was
one
of
anxiety
but
we
made
it
in
safety
we
decided
to
take
a
different
route
on
our
return
from
the
one
traveled
going
down
so
on
leaving
bowie
instead
of
taking
the
main
road
back
to
tucson
we
decided
to
go
by
the
way
of
fort
grant
camp
thomas
camp
apache
and
on
to
the
upper
little
colorado
the
road
from
camp
thomas
to
camp
apache
was
reported
to
us
as
almost
impassable
for
wagons
none
having
attempted
the
trip
for
some
three
years
past
the
troops
moved
across
the
mountains
with
pack
animals
however
we
concluded
to
try
it
from
bowie
to
camp
grant
there
was
a
drive
of
nearly
miles
without
water
we
made
the
most
of
the
distance
in
the
afternoon
and
night
on
turning
out
our
teams
just
before
day
they
were
too
thirsty
to
eat
the
grass
it
being
somewhat
dry
we
only
had
about
two
gallons
of
water
which
we
had
kept
for
drinking
and
cooking
on
seeing
the
condition
of
our
poor
animals
we
took
most
of
the
water
and
wet
up
some
bran
we
happened
to
have
giving
a
little
to
each
animal
they
ate
it
with
a
relish
then
started
for
the
grass
eating
heartily
for
some
time
when
we
hitched
up
and
made
the
rest
of
the
distance
in
good
time
since
this
experience
when
traveling
through
desert
country
i
have
made
it
a
rule
to
carry
a
sack
of
bran
when
water
becomes
scarce
wet
a
feed
of
bran
with
one
half
gallon
of
water
and
it
will
do
as
much
good
on
the
last
end
of
a
hard
drive
as
three
times
the
water
without
bran
troops
were
being
massed
at
camp
grant
the
orders
were
for
all
the
apaches
to
move
to
san
carlos
the
greater
portion
being
willing
to
do
so
the
chiricahuis
had
not
yet
decided
to
come
in
there
were
a
number
of
scouts
camped
here
we
laid
over
for
a
few
days
as
we
had
a
desire
to
learn
something
about
these
indians
and
the
condition
of
affairs
before
going
on
we
managed
to
get
acquainted
with
some
of
the
leaders
they
came
to
our
camp
and
talked
most
of
one
night
as
i
intend
to
devote
a
whole
chapter
to
apache
history
i
will
then
relate
our
conversation
with
these
indians
which
was
very
interesting
to
all
of
us
from
camp
grant
to
camp
thomas
we
passed
numbers
of
indian
camps
they
would
try
to
look
savagely
at
us
but
i
could
always
get
a
friendly
look
before
quitting
them
we
had
heard
much
about
the
upper
gila
valley
the
country
settled
now
mostly
by
our
people
before
arriving
at
the
river
crossing
we
fell
in
company
with
an
intelligent
mexican
who
lived
in
pueblo
viejo
he
gave
us
such
full
and
satisfactory
information
about
the
country
that
we
concluded
to
make
our
report
from
it
and
not
spend
any
time
exploring
while
in
camp
on
the
gila
river
on
our
return
home
we
met
an
who
related
to
us
some
of
his
personal
history
i
was
so
much
interested
in
the
story
that
i
have
concluded
to
give
it
to
the
readers
of
this
book
chapter
xliii
narrative
of
our
visitor
life
his
early
studies
and
aspirations
his
marriage
to
a
deceitful
wife
he
flees
to
california
his
wife
assumes
repentance
and
he
returns
to
her
further
hypocrisy
about
noon
while
we
were
in
camp
a
gentleman
apparently
some
years
of
age
came
down
the
trail
from
the
mountains
his
outfit
consisted
of
two
fine
looking
mules
sleek
and
fat
with
all
his
traps
neatly
packed
his
riding
rig
and
arms
were
all
of
the
best
his
blankets
and
clothing
clean
and
neat
the
owner
himself
was
a
man
and
in
every
way
presented
the
appearance
of
a
gentleman
we
were
near
the
road
and
as
from
the
direction
he
had
come
and
the
hour
being
noon
it
was
natural
to
suppose
that
he
would
make
camp
we
invited
him
to
stop
and
share
our
shade
tree
with
us
politeness
and
hospitality
can
be
and
often
is
extended
in
the
camp
of
the
traveler
as
well
as
in
the
abode
of
a
dweller
as
the
stranger
unsaddled
we
noticed
his
movements
were
graceful
his
mules
were
perfectly
gentle
and
seemed
to
understand
their
kindness
to
them
this
captured
me
individually
for
if
there
are
more
unpardonable
sins
allowed
than
are
on
the
list
and
it
was
my
duty
to
furnish
another
i
believe
i
would
hand
in
cruelty
to
dumb
brutes
i
have
seen
men
who
are
considered
both
good
and
great
by
some
people
themselves
included
who
would
get
angry
with
their
animals
and
beat
them
in
a
cruel
senseless
manner
even
showing
a
murderous
spirit
i
have
always
believed
that
such
persons
would
serve
human
beings
the
same
way
when
in
anger
only
they
are
too
cowardly
to
take
the
immediate
consequences
our
visitor
accepted
our
invitation
to
dinner
we
soon
found
that
he
was
an
having
been
in
california
and
the
west
for
many
years
we
insisted
on
his
resting
over
sunday
with
us
and
finally
he
consented
our
conversation
led
on
from
one
thing
to
another
until
our
new
acquaintance
became
quite
communicative
his
conversation
was
very
interesting
as
he
had
traveled
a
great
deal
in
the
west
he
had
visited
salt
lake
city
and
knew
many
places
and
people
that
were
familiar
to
us
finally
he
gave
us
his
name
and
related
the
following
story
as
near
as
i
can
remember
it
he
was
a
native
of
one
of
the
middle
states
was
left
an
orphan
with
a
small
fortune
some
thirty
thousand
dollars
his
disposition
was
to
make
the
best
use
possible
of
his
time
and
money
after
finishing
at
the
common
schools
he
attended
an
eastern
college
studying
medicine
etc
while
at
college
he
was
allowed
a
stipulated
amount
for
pocket
money
this
was
always
used
prudently
but
not
stingily
allowing
himself
all
the
pleasures
he
desired
such
as
would
be
proper
in
good
society
but
never
spending
a
cent
in
vices
of
any
kind
at
the
same
college
there
were
a
great
many
young
men
sons
of
capitalists
many
of
these
wealthy
young
men
did
not
have
occasion
seemingly
to
spend
any
more
money
than
did
our
friend
but
many
of
them
were
addicted
to
habits
that
soon
emptied
their
purses
and
they
would
have
to
borrow
sometimes
coming
to
the
doctor
as
we
will
now
call
him
now
inasmuch
as
these
rich
young
fellows
were
often
broke
whilst
the
doctor
always
had
money
and
to
loan
and
at
the
same
time
never
showed
any
penuriousness
it
became
rumored
that
he
was
immensely
wealthy
this
he
knew
nothing
about
as
he
was
rather
retiring
in
his
disposition
and
did
not
take
part
in
the
gossips
of
the
day
as
time
went
on
he
found
himself
becoming
very
popular
and
sought
after
being
invited
to
parties
balls
receptions
etc
he
thought
nothing
strange
of
this
as
he
met
others
whom
he
knew
to
be
his
inferiors
although
much
wealthier
money
influence
never
entered
his
mind
as
he
felt
content
with
his
little
fortune
believing
that
with
a
good
profession
and
his
start
he
would
be
independent
his
mind
was
at
ease
he
neither
looked
for
a
or
supposed
that
he
was
a
catch
for
anyone
like
all
other
places
this
where
the
doctor
was
had
its
belle
the
handsomest
most
unselfish
and
divinity
upon
earth
all
the
young
bloods
were
in
love
with
her
this
was
before
people
got
mashed
of
course
she
treated
them
all
so
nicely
that
each
fool
thought
he
was
the
favored
one
all
divinities
do
this
i
am
told
the
doctor
according
to
his
own
words
really
fell
in
love
with
this
she
returned
his
affection
with
compound
interest
in
her
eye
the
courtship
was
all
that
two
fond
hearts
could
wish
as
the
doctor
purse
was
as
before
described
always
equal
to
the
occasion
all
envied
his
success
yet
respected
his
character
and
perseverance
everything
looked
bright
so
the
doctor
applied
himself
to
his
studies
with
double
vigor
looking
forward
to
the
happy
day
when
with
his
diploma
and
his
beautiful
intelligent
loving
wife
he
could
go
to
his
home
and
old
friends
and
settle
down
to
business
with
as
bright
a
future
as
ever
man
hoped
for
after
graduating
the
wedding
soon
followed
everything
went
off
in
proper
shape
no
lack
of
means
being
in
the
way
the
doctor
never
asked
or
carded
what
the
bride
fortune
was
her
heart
and
love
were
all
the
dowry
he
wanted
having
given
his
fullest
and
purest
love
he
fully
believed
that
hers
was
as
fully
returned
i
do
not
recollect
just
where
this
occurred
but
this
much
i
do
remember
that
after
the
wedding
the
doctor
took
his
bride
aboard
a
boat
and
started
for
home
supposing
she
understood
his
intentions
as
he
had
talked
of
nothing
else
but
their
future
home
and
happiness
on
arriving
at
a
point
where
they
took
a
conveyance
in
a
different
direction
to
what
the
lady
expected
she
asked
where
are
you
going
the
doctor
replied
this
is
our
way
to
why
are
you
not
going
to
europe
on
a
wedding
tour
well
no
i
had
not
thought
of
that
we
are
going
home
we
can
not
well
afford
a
trip
across
the
ocean
besides
i
am
anxious
to
get
home
and
attend
to
business
this
occurred
in
the
presence
of
many
persons
the
divinity
flew
into
a
terrible
rage
asked
him
who
he
was
that
business
called
him
home
and
that
he
could
not
afford
a
wedding
tour
in
relating
this
the
doctor
seemed
to
go
through
the
whole
scene
in
his
feelings
the
tears
often
showing
in
his
eyes
he
did
not
pretend
to
relate
all
that
had
been
said
imagination
can
only
picture
his
feelings
when
he
learned
that
there
was
no
love
that
all
was
mercenary
on
her
part
and
as
he
never
had
in
any
way
meant
deception
it
was
a
cruel
blow
but
like
a
true
man
he
decided
at
once
and
took
her
back
home
offered
her
a
divorce
which
she
refused
he
gave
her
most
of
his
fortune
and
started
for
california
probably
as
sad
a
man
as
ever
crossed
the
plains
while
in
california
he
was
prospered
and
soon
accumulated
quite
a
fortune
after
a
time
his
wife
seemed
to
repent
of
her
cruelty
to
him
wrote
him
kind
and
loving
letters
asking
forgiveness
and
excused
herself
for
her
unnatural
conduct
by
saying
it
was
on
account
of
her
the
doctor
with
simplicity
finally
believed
her
and
returned
she
had
spent
the
most
that
had
been
given
her
the
doctor
now
commenced
anew
with
all
his
former
hopes
and
aspirations
rebuilt
as
much
as
possible
all
went
well
for
awhile
two
children
were
born
and
the
doctor
really
felt
happy
but
all
was
sham
and
hypocrisy
with
his
wife
she
was
now
acting
so
as
to
get
hold
of
his
money
and
property
at
length
another
scene
was
enacted
the
doctor
was
told
all
that
was
wanted
of
him
was
his
money
a
divorce
was
again
offered
and
urged
the
lady
refused
but
declared
it
her
intention
to
hunt
him
wherever
he
went
till
the
day
of
his
death
and
get
all
she
could
out
of
him
using
the
children
as
a
means
of
working
upon
his
honor
and
her
rights
as
wife
to
demand
all
she
possibly
could
the
doctor
again
left
for
the
west
leaving
all
his
property
for
many
years
his
whole
aim
had
been
to
keep
track
of
the
condition
of
his
children
and
send
money
for
their
education
to
a
trusted
agent
and
keep
himself
hidden
from
the
knowledge
of
his
wife
in
doing
this
he
had
become
a
wanderer
upon
the
earth
but
he
was
still
a
gentleman
i
learned
more
about
this
man
afterwards
of
his
private
business
he
was
quite
a
successful
prospector
but
few
if
any
ever
heard
this
story
from
his
lips
except
ourselves
and
as
it
was
not
given
me
for
publication
i
have
given
no
names
like
this
man
there
are
thousands
in
the
far
west
who
carry
in
their
bosoms
facts
that
would
be
far
more
interesting
than
the
average
fictitious
romance

tex
meeting
with
president
young
he
accepts
our
labors
we
found
the
road
from
the
gila
to
camp
apache
to
be
most
of
the
way
about
the
roughest
any
of
us
had
ever
seen
it
was
all
we
could
possibly
do
to
get
over
some
of
the
rough
places
but
finally
made
the
trip
without
break
or
accident
the
country
in
and
around
camp
apache
is
quite
picturesque
grass
timber
small
streams
and
springs
were
quite
plentiful
from
here
to
cooley
ranch
and
the
country
is
pleasant
to
travel
through
at
cooley
we
were
hospitably
entertained
and
given
much
useful
information
from
him
we
learned
the
condition
of
the
new
settlements
being
made
on
the
little
colorado
under
the
leadership
of
lot
smith
and
brothers
allen
lake
and
ballinger
we
now
felt
somewhat
satisfied
with
our
trip
realizing
that
we
had
been
the
most
successful
prospectors
into
the
land
of
arizona
our
reports
having
been
received
and
acted
upon
the
greater
portion
of
the
settlements
in
arizona
new
mexico
and
old
mexico
are
on
lands
explored
by
our
party
on
this
trip
from
ranch
we
followed
down
the
country
to
stinson
farm
now
snowflake
stinson
had
also
visited
the
mormon
camps
and
spoke
highly
of
their
labors
it
was
now
june
as
we
neared
the
settlements
we
felt
a
feeling
of
joy
at
the
thought
of
meeting
friends
from
home
on
arriving
at
allen
camp
we
met
prest
wells
apostles
snow
and
b
young
with
several
others
just
from
the
settlements
of
utah
here
we
learned
of
the
death
of
bishop
roundy
by
drowning
i
was
glad
to
meet
the
brethren
brothers
stewart
pratt
and
ivins
had
expressed
a
desire
to
return
home
i
had
intended
to
go
with
my
son
wiley
to
where
we
supposed
brothers
smith
and
tenney
were
still
laboring
but
here
learned
that
they
had
gone
home
prest
wells
advised
me
to
go
home
i
told
him
i
hated
to
return
just
then
saying
that
i
did
not
feel
as
though
i
had
filled
my
mission
he
addressed
me
a
little
sharply
speaking
as
though
he
did
not
believe
me
and
telling
me
i
had
better
go
in
with
his
company
whether
brother
wells
believed
me
or
not
i
was
willing
to
stay
if
left
to
follow
my
own
feelings
but
i
did
as
he
advised
on
the
way
i
noticed
a
disposition
to
treat
me
rather
coolly
many
times
being
snubbed
when
offering
some
information
about
our
trip
i
could
not
understand
this
very
well
at
the
time
on
arriving
at
lot
smith
camp
i
met
my
daughter
mary
and
her
husband
jordan
they
had
been
called
to
assist
in
settling
this
country
my
son
wiley
remained
a
short
time
with
them
then
came
on
to
fairview
our
home
the
trip
in
from
the
little
colorado
was
not
very
pleasant
to
me
the
mode
of
travel
was
so
different
from
what
i
had
been
accustomed
to
that
i
was
continually
out
of
humor
my
mode
of
traveling
was
and
still
is
to
watch
and
take
care
of
my
stock
and
give
it
all
the
advantages
possible
i
have
always
been
able
to
go
over
country
successfully
with
a
common
outfit
while
i
have
heard
of
others
much
better
fitted
up
failing
we
had
made
a
trip
of
near
four
thousand
miles
and
were
now
returning
with
the
same
animals
we
started
with
some
of
them
in
better
condition
than
when
we
left
instead
of
getting
credit
for
this
i
learned
afterwards
that
reports
had
been
circulated
to
the
effect
that
i
was
tyrannical
and
unjust
and
these
statements
doubtless
had
their
influence
upon
my
friends
nothing
was
said
to
me
on
the
road
about
these
reports
but
i
could
see
that
something
was
out
of
joint
from
the
treatment
i
received
which
could
not
be
particularly
defined
but
just
such
as
would
indicate
indifference
to
me
finally
it
became
so
disagreeable
that
i
concluded
to
travel
alone
so
i
came
on
the
last
two
days
without
a
bite
to
eat
rather
than
be
subject
to
the
annoyances
in
the
company
with
which
i
was
then
traveling
i
got
in
hours
ahead
of
the
rest
the
last
day
crossing
the
buckskin
mountain
i
got
quite
hungry
and
thirsty
i
had
about
a
quart
of
corn
that
i
intended
to
eat
but
saved
and
fed
it
to
my
faithful
little
horse
tex
that
had
carried
his
rider
my
son
wiley
already
some
three
thousand
five
hundred
miles
tex
was
in
good
condition
and
i
had
taken
him
to
ride
in
from
little
colorado
home
i
would
not
do
justice
unless
i
mentioned
this
horse
for
he
was
the
most
reliable
animal
i
ever
knew
i
gave
him
all
the
corn
i
had
a
three
pint
canteen
of
water
when
i
was
taking
a
drink
tex
came
up
and
licked
the
canteen
and
looked
at
me
as
though
he
wanted
a
taste
i
set
my
hat
on
the
ground
sinking
the
crown
so
as
to
form
a
dish
then
poured
a
little
water
in
then
the
horse
would
sup
it
up
i
gave
him
the
last
drop
although
i
was
then
dry
and
had
a
big
half
day
ride
yet
to
make
before
getting
to
johnston
settlement
after
baiting
i
saddled
up
arriving
at
navajo
wells
about
one
hour
by
sun
there
was
some
squaws
watering
their
horses
i
got
them
to
give
tex
a
little
water
but
it
was
too
filthy
for
me
to
drink
there
i
again
baited
half
an
hour
then
got
on
my
horse
telling
him
how
hungry
and
thirsty
i
was
and
that
i
had
given
him
all
the
advantage
and
now
it
was
but
fair
for
him
to
take
me
in
twelve
miles
in
a
hurry
this
he
did
in
fine
style
scarcely
breaking
the
gallop
all
the
way
i
met
president
young
at
kanab
he
was
glad
to
see
me
and
hear
the
report
from
mexico
brother
young
was
a
true
friend
to
me
and
understood
my
disposition
he
never
allowed
anyone
to
speak
against
me
he
knew
my
faults
also
some
of
my
virtues
one
that
he
always
appreciated
was
my
stubbornness
when
i
started
on
a
trip
i
had
always
stuck
to
it
i
said
nothing
to
him
about
my
annoyances
brother
brigham
expressed
himself
well
satisfied
with
the
results
of
our
trip
said
it
was
an
opening
for
a
greater
work
i
reported
all
the
brethren
good
and
faithful
doing
honor
to
those
we
represented
i
never
knew
until
coming
to
salt
lake
that
there
was
any
dissatisfaction
i
knew
we
had
differed
in
our
opinions
sometimes
about
standing
guard
but
as
i
always
took
my
turn
and
sometimes
more
i
never
dreamed
of
anyone
holding
for
being
required
to
stand
guard
i
think
that
these
reports
and
what
grew
out
of
them
have
affected
that
mission
and
do
to
this
day
time
will
bring
all
things
right
many
strange
things
are
permitted
that
we
can
not
see
any
use
in
at
the
time
that
afterwards
turn
to
be
a
blessing
chapter
xlv
a
colonizing
mission
to
mexico
i
prefer
to
be
relieved
my
wish
not
granted
the
company
who
volunteered
our
start
from
george
parting
with
president
young
i
arrived
home
about
the
of
july
found
my
family
all
well
i
settled
down
to
work
at
once
making
as
they
were
in
good
demand
and
my
family
needed
the
help
they
would
bring
i
had
been
at
home
about
one
month
when
i
received
a
note
from
president
young
requesting
me
to
come
to
the
city
as
he
wished
to
talk
to
me
about
the
mexican
missions
on
meeting
president
young
in
the
city
he
said
i
would
like
to
have
you
pick
a
few
families
and
take
charge
of
them
and
go
into
the
far
south
and
start
a
settlement
would
you
like
to
do
it
i
answered
yes
i
will
go
whom
would
you
like
to
go
with
you
i
want
the
settling
to
stick
and
not
fail
i
replied
give
me
men
with
large
families
and
small
means
so
that
when
we
get
there
they
will
be
too
poor
to
come
back
and
we
will
have
to
stay
he
laughed
and
said
it
was
a
good
idea
while
in
salt
lake
receiving
instructions
from
president
young
and
preparing
to
go
on
the
colonizing
mission
i
heard
for
the
first
time
of
the
hard
stories
told
against
me
there
is
one
thing
i
would
like
to
say
that
i
think
should
be
considered
by
all
saints
and
that
is
few
men
possibly
none
ever
made
an
overland
trip
of
four
thousand
miles
over
deserts
and
through
the
most
dangerous
country
on
the
continent
and
got
through
without
some
little
family
jars
there
had
been
attempts
made
to
explore
the
southern
country
that
had
practically
failed
president
young
had
expressed
confidence
in
my
ability
to
make
the
trip
and
so
i
felt
determined
to
do
my
best
i
knew
that
our
little
mules
and
ponies
were
our
dependence
for
if
we
had
lost
them
we
might
have
perished
or
at
least
suffered
great
hardships
as
well
as
losing
time
and
more
still
i
realized
the
success
or
failure
of
our
trip
would
have
a
great
effect
upon
others
who
might
follow
after
all
this
made
me
extremely
careful
one
fault
i
have
always
had
and
with
all
my
experience
in
life
it
still
hangs
to
me
that
is
anything
that
is
clear
to
my
understanding
to
be
right
i
naturally
think
others
ought
to
see
the
same
it
was
so
on
this
trip
i
naturally
thought
every
man
understood
as
well
as
i
did
the
importance
of
taking
care
of
our
outfit
i
was
so
much
discouraged
at
the
effects
of
these
reports
that
i
felt
as
though
i
never
wanted
to
take
charge
of
another
mission
of
any
kind
i
wrote
a
note
to
president
young
asking
him
to
appoint
someone
else
to
take
charge
and
i
would
go
along
as
guide
and
interpreter
president
young
paid
no
attention
to
my
suggestion
i
went
to
brother
woodruff
and
asked
him
to
speak
to
brother
brigham
on
the
subject
instead
of
doing
which
he
told
me
i
was
wrong
to
notice
these
reports
and
that
all
men
who
were
called
to
do
a
good
work
met
opposition
i
told
him
that
i
really
believed
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
put
me
in
charge
of
the
colony
that
i
had
been
used
to
doing
hard
service
so
much
that
i
had
gotten
in
the
habit
of
being
arbitrary
and
i
was
afraid
i
would
not
have
patience
to
act
as
a
presiding
elder
should
brother
woodruff
said
he
believed
i
was
honest
and
sincere
and
he
would
speak
to
brother
brigham
on
the
subject
on
visiting
brother
young
he
said
he
wanted
me
to
go
ahead
that
an
angel
could
not
please
everybody
and
added
you
know
how
to
travel
how
to
take
care
of
teams
you
are
better
acquainted
with
the
roads
the
country
the
natives
and
their
language
and
are
better
prepared
to
take
charge
of
a
company
than
any
one
i
know
of
go
ahead
and
do
the
best
you
can
when
you
get
things
started
we
can
send
some
man
to
take
your
place
and
you
can
go
on
and
open
up
more
new
country
this
is
your
mission
with
this
understanding
i
went
to
work
with
a
will
to
get
ready
for
the
trip
i
still
felt
quite
sore
about
the
stories
circulated
for
they
were
not
just
but
one
thing
i
had
to
acknowledge
that
made
me
a
little
careful
what
i
said
to
brother
brigham
he
had
warned
me
against
one
of
the
company
who
had
volunteered
to
go
he
advised
me
not
to
take
him
saying
that
he
would
try
to
take
the
mission
away
from
me
and
would
make
me
trouble
this
i
should
have
listened
to
but
the
man
seemed
so
earnest
and
desirous
to
go
that
i
pled
for
him
and
brother
young
finally
consented
i
was
served
just
right
brother
brigham
spoke
truly
anyone
doubting
it
can
investigate
for
themselves
i
have
said
all
i
wish
to
about
the
matter
brother
brigham
said
he
wanted
volunteers
that
no
one
would
be
called
unless
he
was
perfectly
willing
otherwise
rather
desired
them
not
to
go
the
following
names
with
their
families
were
soon
enrolled
for
the
mission

and

notice
was
given
that
we
would
meet
at
george
about
christmas
and
there
organize
president
young
intending
to
winter
there
i
had
to
work
hard
and
make
many
shifts
and
trades
to
get
an
outfit
sufficient
to
move
my
family
in
comfort
i
was
a
little
late
in
starting
on
the
road
merrills
and
his
family
overtook
us
at
sevier
bridge
we
traveled
together
to
george
on
arriving
there
we
found
all
the
company
in
camp
in
a
yard
with
the
privilege
of
using
the
house
when
needed
in
case
of
storm
it
was
now
about
the
first
of
january
and
the
weather
was
quite
disagreeable
here
a
brother
williams
joined
us
on
looking
over
the
outfit
i
soon
found
that
many
of
the
wagons
were
overloaded
and
that
much
of
the
loading
being
taken
could
be
dispensed
with
i
advised
the
selling
off
of
such
as
old
stoves
sewing
machines
and
many
other
heavy
articles
but
no
one
seemed
to
think
but
what
they
could
pull
their
load
my
loading
consisted
of
bedding
clothing
provisions
horse
feed
and
such
articles
as
were
absolutely
necessary
we
had
not
ten
pounds
of
anything
that
could
be
dispensed
with
i
considered
it
my
duty
to
set
the
example
knowing
that
we
had
a
hard
trip
before
us
and
could
not
afford
to
haul
anything
but
the
actual
necessities
with
the
outfit
on
hand
i
spoke
to
brother
brigham
about
the
situation
he
said
get
your
company
in
the
best
shape
you
can
and
as
soon
as
possible
move
out
there
is
a
nice
little
settlement
santa
clara
on
your
road
there
is
a
beautiful
piece
of
sandy
road
from
here
to
there
just
such
as
will
help
you
get
the
brethren
to
see
the
importance
of
lightening
up
when
you
get
there
you
can
set
up
an
auction
store
the
people
are
pretty
well
off
and
will
be
able
to
buy
what
you
have
to
sell
when
all
was
ready
we
started
out
and
as
president
young
said
when
we
got
into
the
santa
clara
settlement
many
of
the
company
were
not
only
willing
but
anxious
to
lighten
up
the
people
of
santa
clara
traded
readily
for
the
stuff
paying
dried
fruit
grain
and
some
money
sometimes
the
loading
traded
for
was
as
heavy
as
that
traded
off
brother
isaac
turley
who
had
traveled
a
portion
of
the
road
and
who
was
an
experienced
traveler
was
elected
he
advised
the
people
not
to
be
afraid
to
trade
for
corn
saying
that
he
was
willing
to
roll
at
a
wheel
to
help
get
a
sack
of
corn
over
a
hard
place
but
did
not
like
to
strain
his
back
to
move
an
old
stove
along
that
was
not
worth
hauling
at
this
place
we
bade
to
president
young
who
drove
out
to
see
us
he
gave
us
his
blessing
and
a
few
words
of
counsel
this
was
the
last
time
i
ever
saw
brother
brigham
to
me
the
best
and
greatest
man
i
have
ever
known
our
instructions
were
to
go
into
the
southern
country
and
settle
where
we
felt
impressed
to
stop
the
intention
was
to
go
on
to
mexico
eventually
chapter
xlvi
we
locate
on
salt
river
letter
from
president
young
we
commence
work
on
our
ditch
hire
indians
to
help
us
my
associations
with
the
red
men
we
passed
down
the
virgin
river
crossed
the
colorado
at
stone
ferry
then
through
mineral
park
walapai
valley
cottonwood
anvil
rock
oaks
and
willows
and
walnut
creek
leaving
prescott
to
the
left
we
continued
on
the
most
direct
route
into
salt
river
valley
the
trip
was
made
without
losing
an
animal
or
suffering
in
any
way
worth
mentioning
in
fact
to
this
day
many
of
the
company
speak
of
the
trip
as
one
of
pleasure
rather
than
suffering
everything
was
under
strict
discipline
no
one
can
travel
safely
through
a
wild
dangerous
country
and
be
neglectful
no
matter
what
those
may
say
who
are
too
lazy
to
stand
guard
without
grumbling
one
incident
of
the
trip
i
will
relate
that
might
be
profitable
in
putting
others
on
their
guard
one
day
while
traveling
through
a
hilly
broken
country
my
son
wiley
and
chas
rogers
both
young
lads
took
their
guns
for
a
hunt
it
was
cloudy
i
warned
them
not
to
go
far
from
the
road
this
they
intended
to
obey
but
soon
after
they
left
the
train
the
road
turned
off
to
the
right
and
changed
the
direction
it
soon
commenced
to
storm
very
hard
and
we
went
into
camp
we
were
now
uneasy
about
the
boys
the
storm
was
the
first
of
the
season
cold
and
wet
and
the
boys
were
without
their
coats
i
tried
to
keep
from
showing
anxiety
for
their
mothers
sake
but
i
felt
about
as
much
concerned
as
i
ever
did
for
i
knew
there
was
great
danger
about
night
i
went
on
to
a
high
hill
piled
up
several
cords
of
dried
cedars
and
set
fire
to
them
about
we
heard
a
loud
hello
we
knew
they
were
coming
they
were
almost
dead
with
fatigue
after
finding
they
were
lost
they
had
traveled
round
and
round
to
keep
from
freezing
to
death
their
strength
had
almost
failed
when
they
saw
the
light
they
had
no
matches
but
were
trying
to
strike
fire
with
their
guns
when
the
light
was
visible
from
where
they
were
there
was
quite
a
mountain
ridge
between
them
and
the
fire
it
was
in
a
different
direction
from
where
they
expected
it
had
barely
shown
a
dim
light
in
the
mountain
top
wiley
said
that
pa
and
started
for
the
fire
this
saved
them
on
arriving
at
salt
river
it
became
plain
to
see
that
we
were
not
in
a
condition
to
go
further
and
as
everything
seemed
inviting
to
us
to
stop
here
we
took
a
vote
on
the
question
of
continuing
all
voted
to
locate
on
salt
river
except
one
man
we
made
camp
where
miller
had
directed
me
to
the
ditch
site
next
morning
we
commenced
work
on
the
head
of
the
ditch
ross
rogers
began
surveying
the
ditch
with
a
and
we
had
been
to
work
but
a
few
hours
when
a
party
came
and
claimed
that
we
were
on
a
ditch
site
already
staked
and
owned
miller
had
posted
me
on
this
the
survey
had
been
made
and
stakes
set
but
sufficient
work
had
not
been
done
to
hold
the
right
of
way
so
i
told
the
gentleman
in
charge
of
the
party
that
we
would
not
interfere
with
his
survey
that
we
had
noticed
his
stakes
and
would
not
disturb
them
he
finally
offered
to
sell
us
the
right
of
way
i
told
him
we
were
not
prepared
to
buy
but
would
try
and
be
careful
not
to
interfere
with
his
rights
the
party
left
and
we
heard
no
more
from
them
we
arranged
affairs
to
the
best
advantage
possible
according
to
the
wisdom
we
had
and
went
to
work
on
what
was
registered
and
is
known
as
the
utah
ditch
on
reporting
to
president
young
the
following
letter
was
received
salt
lake
city
d
w
jones
camp
utah
dear
brother
on
my
return
from
ogden
last
evening
i
found
your
note
awaiting
me
the
brethren
who
have
been
called
to
go
to
arizona
reside
in
various
parts
of
this
territory
they
will
start
as
they
get
ready
and
come
dropping
in
upon
you
from
time
to
time
without
any
special
instructions
from
the
presidency
of
the
church
only
to
commence
their
labors
at
as
early
a
date
as
they
reasonably
can
for
this
reason
we
can
not
say
anything
about
making
arrangements
beforehand
for
their
flour
but
they
will
have
to
do
as
we
have
done
before
get
it
as
best
they
may
after
their
arrival
we
should
be
pleased
to
learn
from
you
how
far
you
consider
it
from
your
camp
to
the
settlements
on
the
little
colorado
river
and
which
road
you
deem
the
best
thereto
we
should
also
like
to
know
what
your
intentions
are
with
regard
to
settling
the
region
for
which
you
originally
started
we
do
not
deem
it
prudent
for
you
to
break
up
your
present
location
but
possibly
next
fall
you
will
find
it
consistent
to
continue
your
journey
with
a
portion
of
those
who
are
now
with
you
while
others
will
come
and
occupy
the
places
vacated
by
you
we
do
not
however
wish
you
to
get
the
idea
from
the
above
remarks
that
we
desire
to
hurry
you
away
from
where
you
now
are
or
to
force
a
settlement
in
the
district
to
which
you
refer
until
it
is
safe
to
do
so
and
free
from
the
dangers
of
indian
difficulties
but
we
regard
it
as
one
of
the
spots
where
the
saints
will
sooner
or
later
gather
to
build
up
zion
and
we
feel
the
sooner
the
better
last
evening
i
returned
from
cache
valley
where
i
had
been
resting
a
few
days
tomorrow
myself
and
party
start
for
juab
and
sanpete
counties
to
organize
a
stake
of
zion
there
while
brothers
lorenzo
snow
and
franklin
richards
will
go
to
morgan
and
summit
counties
and
organize
there
we
have
thus
to
divide
or
we
should
not
get
through
with
the
organization
of
the
stakes
in
time
to
commence
the
quarterly
conferences
in
those
that
were
first
organized
we
have
no
special
counsel
to
give
you
or
your
company
at
present
only
to
live
so
as
to
retain
within
you
the
spirit
of
the
lord
that
it
may
be
to
you
a
present
helper
in
every
time
of
need
and
a
guide
that
can
be
called
upon
on
all
occasions
be
prudent
in
all
the
measures
you
enter
into
economical
with
your
time
and
supplies
be
just
one
towards
another
and
kind
and
friendly
with
all
men
do
your
utmost
by
precept
and
example
to
win
the
hearts
of
the
lamanites
and
ever
use
the
influence
you
acquire
over
them
for
good
for
their
salvation
and
education
in
the
arts
of
peace
and
industry
in
this
course
the
blessing
of
the
lord
will
be
with
you
and
you
shall
be
established
in
peace
and
prosperity
shall
attend
your
efforts
to
build
up
kingdom
that
this
may
be
so
is
the
prayer
of
your
brother
in
the
gospel
brigham
young
we
commenced
on
the
ditch
march
all
hands
worked
with
a
will
part
of
the
company
moved
down
on
to
lands
located
for
settlements
most
of
the
men
formed
a
working
camp
near
the
head
of
the
ditch
where
a
deep
cut
had
to
be
made
we
hired
considerable
help
when
we
could
procure
it
for
such
pay
as
we
could
command
as
scrub
ponies
hayden
scrip
etc
among
those
employed
were
a
number
of
indians
pimas
maricopas
papagoes
yumas
yaquis
and
one
or
two
apaches
mojaves
the
most
of
them
were
good
workers
some
of
these
indians
expressed
a
desire
to
come
and
settle
with
us
this
was
the
most
interesting
part
of
the
mission
to
me
and
i
naturally
supposed
that
all
the
company
felt
the
same
spirit
but
i
soon
found
my
mistake
for
on
making
this
desire
of
the
indians
known
to
the
company
many
objected
some
saying
that
they
did
not
want
their
families
brought
into
association
with
these
dirty
indians
so
little
interest
was
manifested
by
the
company
that
i
made
the
mistake
of
jumping
at
the
conclusion
that
i
would
have
to
go
ahead
whether
i
was
backed
up
or
not
i
learned
afterwards
that
if
i
had
been
more
patient
and
faithful
that
i
would
have
had
more
help
but
at
the
time
i
acted
according
to
the
best
light
i
had
and
determined
to
stick
to
the
indians
this
spirit
manifested
to
the
company
showing
a
preference
to
the
natives
naturally
created
a
prejudice
against
me
soon
dissatisfaction
commenced
to
show
the
result
was
that
most
of
the
company
left
and
went
onto
the
san
pedro
in
southern
arizona
led
by
merrill
after
this
move
there
being
but
four
families
left
and
one
of
these
soon
leaving
our
little
colony
was
quite
weak
the
three
families
remaining
with
me
professed
to
sustain
my
management
for
a
little
season
then
they
turned
more
bitter
against
me
than
those
who
went
away
no
doubt
but
they
felt
justified
in
their
own
feelings
and
as
i
am
writing
my
own
history
and
not
theirs
i
will
allow
them
the
same
privilege
it
was
not
long
until
it
became
manifest
that
i
would
have
to
either
give
up
the
indians
or
lose
my
standing
with
the
white
brethren
i
chose
the
natives
and
will
now
give
as
truthful
a
history
of
my
labors
among
them
as
my
memory
will
serve
in
about
six
weeks
from
the
time
we
commenced
we
had
sufficient
water
out
to
plant
some
garden
stuff
and
a
few
acres
of
com
when
this
was
done
brother
turley
took
a
number
of
teams
and
went
to
freighting
for
hayden
to
pay
the
debt
we
had
now
made
some
fifteen
hundred
dollars
this
debt
could
soon
have
been
paid
if
all
hands
had
stayed
together
but
as
the
most
left
the
debt
finally
fell
upon
me
to
finish
paying
up
this
tied
me
up
on
salt
river

some
time

for

some

the

help
given
on
our
ditch
by
the
pimas
and
maricopas
the
agent
forbids
my
interfering
with
the
indians
as
often
as
opportunity
offered
i
talked
to
the
indians
as
yet
i
had
not
found
an
interpreter
that
suited
me
several
whom
i
had
met
the
year
before
had
not
come
to
our
camp
yet
their
homes
being
some
distance
away
the
interpreter
i
used
geo
roberts
was
something
of
an
adventurer
as
the
sequel
will
show
i
was
at
work
one
day
in
a
field
planting
after
we
had
been
settled
for
some
six
weeks
when
my
interpreter
came
to
me
and
said
there
were
several
of
the
leading
men
of
the
salt
river
pimas
who
wished
me
to
come
down
to
my
camp
where
they
were
and
baptize
them
i
told
him
i
did
not
think
the
indians
understood
enough
to
be
baptized
that
i
had
not
had
time
to
teach
them
sufficiently
he
said
i
had
talked
a
great
deal
to
him
that
he
understood
and
believed
all
i
said
and
fully
explained
all
my
words
to
these
little
captains
who
also
believed
and
wished
baptism
i
did
not
feel
satisfied
i
have
always
been
slow
to
baptize
natives
my
policy
has
been
to
teach
them
first
so
that
they
would
fully
realize
what
they
were
doing
i
have
endeavored
more
to
get
them
out
of
their
degradation
and
savagery
when
i
met
these
indians
i
asked
them
using
the
interpreter
what
they
desired
they
said
they
wished
to
be
baptized
and
be
mormons
i
told
the
interpreter
to
say
to
them
that
i
did
not
want
them
to
be
baptized
until
they
fully
understood
what
baptism
was
for
i
continued
talking
explaining
what
the
requirements
were
etc
the
interpreter
insisted
after
talking
quite
a
while
with
the
chiefs
that
they
fully
understood
me
and
were
ready
i
then
told
him
to
say
to
them
go
back
to
your
camp
talk
with
your
head
chief
and
your
people
and
explain
these
things
take
time
to
reconsider
and
do
not
be
in
a
hurry
to
get
baptized
a
few
days
after
this
my
interpreter
again
came
to
me
and
said
many
hundred
indians
had
come
to
my
camp
i
was
again
at
work
away
from
home
all
ready
and
wanting
to
be
baptized
i
was
now
sorely
puzzled
for
there
was
nothing
in
reason
to
convince
me
that
these
ignorant
natives
were
really
subject
to
such
sudden
conversion
still
i
knew
that
our
people
looked
forward
to
a
time
when
a
nation
will
be
born
in
a
day
but
i
did
not
believe
that
time
had
come
yet
it
looked
a
little
that
way
so
i
went
down
on
arriving
at
camp
there
were
indians
in
every
place
and
direction
there
were
between
three
and
four
hundred
all
looking
pleasant
and
smiling
the
chiefs
were
grouped
sitting
quietly
and
sedately
i
commenced
to
talk
to
and
question
them
repeating
what
i
had
formerly
said
and
added
more
and
in
every
way
endeavored
to
fasten
upon
their
minds
the
responsibility
of
being
baptized
i
really
desired
to
deter
them
if
possible
for
i
had
no
faith
in
the
reality
of
the
situation
but
my
interpreter
who
talked
at
length
to
them
professing
to
explain
all
my
words
insisted
that
they
fully
understood
and
wanted
to
be
baptized
the
whole
tribe
included
several
elders
were
present
and
i
asked
what
shall
i
do
i
have
no
faith
in
this
there
is
something
wrong
all
said
i
had
done
my
duty
if
they
insisted
all
we
could
do
was
to
baptize
them
as
we
had
no
right
to
refuse
i
told
the
indians
all
right
we
would
go
to
the
river
at
this
all
hands
started
the
young
ones
laughing
and
playing
the
older
ones
more
sedate
as
i
started
to
the
river
i
observed
a
strange
indian
looking
intently
at
me
he
was
dressed
differently
from
the
rest
i
asked
him
if
he
understood
spanish
he
answered
yes
perfectly
have
you
heard
and
understood
the
talk
with
the
pimas
yes
sir
and
the
indians
are
deceived
your
interpreter
is
either
dishonest
or
does
not
understand
you
i
hardly
know
which
but
i
think
it
is
a
little
of
both
he
talks
considerable
spanish
but
he
has
not
fully
understood
you
i
fully
understand
and
want
to
help
you
will
you
go
with
me
now
and
i
will
again
talk
to
them
yes
on
the
way
to
the
river
my
new
friend
informed
me
that
the
main
inducement
offered
for
baptism
by
my
interpreter
was
that
to
all
who
would
be
baptized
i
would
give
a
new
shirt
and
to
the
men
of
families
who
had
no
land
i
would
give
lands
so
it
was
no
wonder
at
the
number
of
converts
when
we
got
to
the
river
bank
i
called
the
principal
men
together
and
taught
them
for
a
long
time
fully
explaining
the
true
situation
and
requirements
the
old
chief
chiacum
said
he
thought
i
must
have
lots
of
shirts
and
had
looked
around
wondering
where
all
my
land
was
my
interpreter
looked
rather
sheepish
when
all
was
explained
the
old
chief
said
he
did
not
fully
understand
all
i
had
said
but
one
thing
he
understood
and
was
willing
to
try
that
baptism
required
one
to
be
a
better
man
said
he
i
am
willing
to
be
baptized
and
listen
to
your
talk
for
i
believe
it
is
good
i
will
seek
to
be
a
better
man
and
try
to
learn
more
about
god
now
here
are
three
of
us
who
are
willing
to
do
this
if
this
will
do
you
can
baptize
us
we
do
not
want
any
shirts
we
will
then
try
to
learn
and
teach
your
words
to
our
people
and
when
they
are
ready
we
will
tell
you
and
you
can
baptize
them
i
now
felt
satisfied
and
baptized
the
old
chief
and
the
ones
he
named
feeling
a
real
joy
for
i
knew
they
were
honest
this
deception
of
my
first
interpreter
had
its
effect
that
reaches
far
into
the
future
believing
on
the
start
that
he
would
be
useful
to
me
i
had
given
him
a
piece
of
land
near
by
camp
where
he
had
been
doing
a
little
work
i
now
felt
so
disappointed
in
him
that
i
wished
to
get
rid
of
him
he
said
if
he
got
his
pay
for
the
land
he
would
leave
this
he
received
in
full
and
i
thought
i
would
hear
no
more
of
him
in
this
too
i
was
disappointed
often
during
the
spring
and
summer
natives
visited
our
camp
enquiring
about
our
people
and
principles
i
heard
that
the
shirt
and
land
story
had
reached
quite
a
distance
one
party
of
maricopas
fourteen
in
number
headed
by
an
old
chief
malia
came
to
see
us
they
were
very
poor
and
destitute
but
seemed
more
intelligent
than
the
average
i
was
very
busy
being
obliged
to
go
away
from
camp
the
old
chief
said
they
were
willing
to
help
me
and
insisted
that
i
would
show
them
some
work
to
do
saying
they
would
remain
and
work
until
i
had
time
to
talk
to
them
this
old
fellow
talked
good
spanish
i
showed
them
a
piece
of
land
that
we
desired
to
plant
in
corn
they
went
to
work
and
cleared
the
brush
from
it
i
afterwards
gave
this
same
land
to
these
indians
when
brother
merrills
left
our
ditch
was
not
nearly
finished
in
fact
it
was
simply
commenced
and
we
who
were
left
were
almost
destitute
and
heavily
in
debt
some
of
the
same
indians
we
had
employed
offered
to
take
hold
and
help
us
finish
up
the
ditch
if
we
would
let
them
have
some
land
lying
along
the
river
bottom
the
land
was
sandy
and
broken
with
hills
and
hollows
and
there
was
considerable
brush
on
it
it
was
a
kind
of
land
the
whites
did
not
desire
but
the
very
kind
the
indians
preferred
i
agreed
to
let
them
have
this
privilege
the
first
who
came
were
the
same
party
under
malia
maricopas
who
worked
clearing
off
land
i
gave
them
the
eastern
portion
of
the
land
francisco
chico
ochoa
a
pima
came
well
recommended
as
a
good
honest
man
he
agreed
to
keep
me
posted
in
regard
to
the
character
of
those
applying
for
lands
the
pimas
were
to
have
the
western
portion
of
the
lands
the
agreement
was
that
no
indians
would
be
allowed
to
remain
on
these
lands
except
those
who
would
observe
good
order
live
honest
sober
and
work
for
their
own
living
and
in
no
way
molest
the
settlers
i
talked
with
hayden
and
some
others
about
my
plans
they
said
the
indians
were
generally
and
that
years
before
the
whites
had
invited
quite
a
colony
of
pimas
to
leave
the
gila
and
come
and
settle
on
salt
river
as
a
kind
of
outpost
or
guard
against
the
apaches
this
had
been
a
success
but
said
hayden
as
the
country
builds
up
and
these
indians
are
not
needed
you
will
doubtless
see
some
of
these
same
men
who
invited
them
here
join
in
to
drive
them
away
you
no
doubt
will
have
trouble
with
your
indians
in
time
i
was
deeply
interested
in
these
natives
and
felt
determined
to
do
all
i
could
for
them
in
fact
it
was
indian
or
nothing
if
we
finished
our
ditch
in
time
to
do
anything
the
following
season
so
i
divided
off
the
land
between
the
pimas
and
maricopas
leaving
the
chiefs
to
divide
the
lands
among
their
people
they
soon
went
to
work
enlarging
the
ditch
these
natives
were
of
the
poorer
class
having
been
living
in
settlements
where
the
water
had
been
shut
off
from
them
they
had
been
living
for
years
in
poverty
and
degradation
their
association
with
white
men
had
only
degraded
them
the
more
and
they
were
dwindling
away
and
numbering
less
and
less
every
year
so
when
they
had
the
privilege
of
taking
hold
with
us
they
were
truly
grateful
when
they
commenced
to
move
some
thirty
odd
miles
my
son
wiley
took
his
team
and
hauled
their
stuff
for
them
the
squaws
appreciated
this
as
most
everything
would
have
been
carried
on
their
heads
many
a
time
they
would
pack
from
to
a
hundred
pounds
some
may
ask
if
these
indians
were
so
destitute
what
was
there
to
move
i
will
see
if
i
can
think
what
there
was
i
remember
well
there
was
an
load
for
the
maricopas
without
giving
the
number
and
pounds
i
will
name
some
of
the
principal
articles
there
were
earthen
water
jars
and
cooking
utensils
baskets
and
more
baskets
dogs
too
poor
to
make
it
afoot
mosquite
beans
old
rawhides
metats
primitive
a
few
old
shovels
hoes
axes
wooden
plows
etc
these
were
about
the
average
outfit
of
an
indian
household
they
were
about
destitute
of
provisions
i
went
and
made
arrangements
with
hayden
for
their
bread
stuff
the
ditch
was
enlarged
during
the
fall
and
winter
so
that
there
were
several
hundred
acres
of
grain
sowed
by
ourselves
and
indians
i
helped
many
of
the
indians
get
their
seed
grain
and
some
of
them
borrowed
from
their
more
prosperous
friends
they
also
got
cattle
to
plow
their
fields
from
the
indians
on
the
gila
as
these
people
began
to
prosper
others
came
and
wished
to
join
in
and
continue
to
enlarge
the
ditch
and
clear
off
and
level
down
the
broken
lands
sometimes
the
stock
belonging
to
the
indians
living
on
their
own
lands
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
from
our
camp
would
encroach
on
our
fields
this
was
extremely
annoying
and
many
of
the
whites
were
sorely
tried
i
was
continually
working
to
get
a
right
understanding
established
the
indians
claimed
that
no
one
had
a
right
to
occupy
more
country
than
they
could
fence
or
guard
and
said
that
the
people
owning
the
fields
were
the
ones
to
take
care
of
them
and
watch
the
cattle
some
of
the
settlers
accepted
the
situation
and
when
the
indian
stock
would
get
onto
their
grain
fields
they
would
shoot
them
down
this
rather
got
away
with
the
indians
yet
they
would
not
get
mad
but
would
take
the
carcasses
for
food
owing
to
this
trouble
many
of
the
white
settlers
became
opposed
to
the
indians
remaining
longer
on
salt
river
so
petitions
were
circulated
and
signed
asking
the
government
to
remove
them
the
agent
visited
me
one
day
while
i
was
working
on
the
ditch
with
some
forty
indians
helping
he
accosted
me
in
a
very
uncivil
tone
and
manner
and
wanted
to
know
what
i
was
doing
with
his
indians
i
said
i
was
not
aware
that
he
owned
these
people
he
said
he
was
the
agent
from
sacaton
that
he
had
heard
that
i
was
teaching
these
indians
mormonism
and
inducing
them
to
leave
the
agency
and
that
he
wanted
the
business
stopped
i
told
him
it
was
none
of
his
business
what
i
was
doing
with
the
indians
asked
him
if
he
knew
what
mormonism
was
he
said
he
did
not
know
anything
about
it
then
you
had
better
wait
until
you
do
before
commanding
me
to
quit
teaching
it
i
teach
them
to
quit
stealing
gambling
getting
drunk
and
practicing
other
and
worse
vices
and
to
be
cleanly
and
industrious
and
advised
them
to
earn
their
own
living
and
get
ready
to
educate
their
young
people
to
quit
killing
witches
burning
their
dead
etc
how
does
that
suit
you
o
that
is
all
right
well
sir
that
is
a
part
of
mormonism
he
seemed
a
little
stumped
then
said
well
if
i
hear
of
any
trouble
i
shall
forbid
you
employing
these
indians
i
here
showed
him
a
letter
that
i
had
received
from
him
when
we
first
came
in
asking
me
to
give
employment
to
a
party
of
indians
saying
that
they
were
good
men
and
willing
to
work
but
had
no
means
of
support
and
that
anything
i
could
do
for
them
would
be
appreciated
i
called
his
attention
to
what
i
had
done
for
this
people
according
to
his
request
and
asked
him
if
he
would
like
a
copy
of
the
letter
sent
to
washington
i
never
heard
any
more
complaint
from
the
agent
the
indians
that
i
had
taken
in
to
help
on
the
ditch
had
but
little
stock
and
had
agreed
to
take
care
of
it
which
they
generally
did
but
visitors
would
come
to
see
them
and
would
sometimes
be
careless
but
the
greatest
trouble
we
had
was
with
some
five
hundred
pimas
who
were
settled
about
five
miles
from
us
that
we
had
no
particular
control
over
they
having
settled
there
before
our
arrival
i
in
common
with
others
was
much
annoyed
by
their
cattle
but
desiring
peace
i
studied
how
to
outgeneral
these
cattle
i
had
also
studied
very
hard
to
get
an
insight
into
the
indian
character
and
ways
and
was
on
the
watch
for
an
opportunity
the
old
chief
whom
i
had
baptized
had
some
twenty
head
of
work
cattle
belonging
to
his
family
and
particular
friends
they
had
come
onto
my
fields
several
times
the
old
man
always
said
it
was
his
boy
fault
and
seemed
to
regret
it
sometimes
paying
a
few
sacks
of
wheat
for
damages
i
told
him
that
paying
damages
was
a
bad
thing
it
was
loss
to
him
and
no
gain
to
me
that
i
wanted
the
cattle
kept
off
finally
an
idea
struck
me
the
cattle
had
damaged
my
crops
a
number
of
times
one
day
when
i
found
them
in
my
field
i
sent
them
to
the
chief
with
word
that
if
they
got
on
my
field
three
times
more
that
they
would
be
mine
and
that
i
would
put
my
brand
on
them
soon
the
old
man
came
over
to
see
me
bringing
a
good
interpreter
said
he
i
do
not
understand
what
you
say
about
branding
my
cattle
here
i
took
a
memorandum
book
from
my
pocket
and
commenced
figuring
i
explained
to
him
that
the
cattle
had
been
on
my
field
and
damaged
me
to
an
amount
almost
as
much
as
the
cattle
were
worth
and
that
three
times
more
damaging
would
pay
for
the
cattle
when
i
would
have
a
right
to
put
my
brand
on
them
having
paid
their
full
value
i
talked
pleasantly
and
kindly
admitting
that
he
was
a
good
man
and
wanted
to
do
right
but
his
boys
were
bad
and
careless
i
said
i
would
loan
them
the
cattle
for
a
while
as
i
did
not
need
them
but
would
let
him
know
when
i
wanted
them
the
old
man
was
puzzled
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
or
do
at
length
after
sitting
and
studying
a
while
he
said
suppose
the
cattle
never
get
onto
your
land
again
how
will
it
be
then
i
then
showed
him
my
book
and
explained
to
him
that
some
accounts
were
in
pencil
and
some
in
pen
and
ink
that
his
was
still
in
pencil
and
if
left
that
way
would
wear
out
after
a
time
but
sometimes
it
lasted
two
or
three
years
and
that
if
he
would
keep
his
cattle
away
for
a
long
time
i
would
not
write
with
ink
and
maybe
the
pencil
marks
would
all
wear
out
he
seemed
pleased
at
this
saying
that
the
cattle
should
not
get
back
any
more
and
the
account
would
be
sure
to
wear
out
before
they
came
back
i
now
gave
the
old
man
a
piece
of
ground
on
our
side
near
the
crossing
of
the
river
he
said
he
would
live
there
and
watch
the
cattle
himself
and
not
let
them
cross
this
was
the
land
i
had
formerly
given
to
my
first
interpreter
who
had
deceived
me
so
this
same
fellow
came
afterwards
and
claimed
the
land
he
was
a
maricopa
this
was
on
the
end
of
the
land
i
had
given
to
the
pimas
i
explained
this
to
him
although
i
considered
there
was
nothing
due
to
the
man
i
offered
him
land
up
among
his
own
people
this
he
declined
but
claimed
the
first
piece
i
told
him
i
had
paid
him
for
the
land
he
said
i
had
not
paid
him
for
the
land
but
for
the
work
done
on
it
that
the
land
was
his
i
finally
told
him
to
leave
and
bother
me
no
more
that
he
was
dishonest
and
i
did
not
want
to
see
him
till
he
was
a
better
man
chapter
xlviii
i
am
accused
of
conniving
with
the
indians
to
steal
my
arrest
investigation
and
discharge
the
fate
of
witches
among
the
natives
i
interfere
to
prevent
their
murder
captain
norval
threat
his
mistake
more
white
people
were
coming
into
the
valley
all
the
time
to
settle
and
a
deep
prejudice
against
the
indians
was
soon
developed
i
was
accused
of
being
in
collusion
with
them
in
running
off
the
stock
so
as
to
get
a
reward
for
returning
it
this
charge
was
presented
to
the
agent
at
the
gila
agency
and
from
him
it
was
sent
to
the
military
commander
at
camp
mcdowell
there
had
been
many
accusations
against
the
indians
and
myself
before
this
but
nothing
in
a
formal
way
this
time
notice
had
to
be
taken
so
capt
summerhays
with
a
posse
of
soldiers
came
to
my
ranch
i
had
often
been
to
the
camp
and
had
talked
to
the
officers
about
my
affairs
with
the
indians
there
was
from
the
first
a
disposition
of
honor
manifested
by
the
military
toward
my
labors
the
posse
arrived
about
sundown
the
captain
came
in
opened
some
papers
and
said
his
orders
were
to
arrest
me
for
being
in
with
the
indians
in
stealing
stock
and
asked
if
i
could
prove
myself
clear
i
told
him
i
did
not
intend
to
try
to
prove
my
innocence
but
would
help
him
to
prove
my
guilt
if
possible
for
if
guilty
i
wanted
to
find
it
out
and
quit
it
this
rather
pleased
the
captain
who
laughingly
said
well
you
are
a
prisoner
but
i
will
trust
you
not
to
run
away
next
morning
we
went
out
to
see
what
evidence
could
be
found
we
first
visited
the
indians
and
heard
their
story
they
said
that
the
whites
who
were
coming
into
the
country
were
careless
about
their
stock
and
it
often
strayed
off
a
long
ways
some
of
the
owners
had
offered
to
pay
them
for
hunting
it
up
when
they
brought
the
stock
some
paid
them
while
others
who
were
bad
men
would
abuse
them
and
tell
them
they
had
driven
the
stock
away
on
purpose
to
receive
a
reward
for
finding
it
they
said
captain
jones
always
told
them
to
be
honest
with
everybody
and
had
forbidden
any
indians
to
come
to
his
place
unless
they
would
do
right
the
indians
were
very
earnest
in
their
talk
saying
they
had
been
friends
to
the
people
that
had
come
in
and
that
it
was
bad
to
be
accused
so
unjustly
and
said
they
would
not
hunt
any
more
stock
the
captain
told
them
that
would
be
wrong
as
the
people
were
poor
and
did
not
know
the
range
one
indian
valensuela
spoke
up
and
said
well
i
will
teach
these
people
better
i
will
go
and
get
their
stock
and
give
it
to
them
and
i
wo
take
a
cent
if
they
offer
it
to
me
the
spirit
and
manner
of
the
indians
convinced
the
captain
that
they
had
been
wrongfully
accused
from
the
indian
camp
we
went
to
where
the
greater
portion
of
my
accusers
were
at
work
on
a
ditch
the
captain
called
the
attention
of
the
crowd
and
made
known
his
business
by
saying
jones
has
been
accused
of
causing
the
indians
to
run
off
your
stock
do
any
of
you
know
anything
about
the
charge
no
one
answered
against
me
some
said
they
did
not
think
i
had
done
anything
of
the
kind
we
were
now
some
three
miles
from
my
ranch
the
captain
drove
back
to
the
road
and
offered
to
take
me
home
saying
he
had
got
through
i
asked
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
his
prisoner
he
offered
to
give
me
a
letter
to
publish
clearing
me
from
all
the
charges
i
told
him
i
had
become
so
used
to
such
things
that
i
cared
but
little
about
them
he
replied
that
it
was
a
good
thing
for
a
man
in
my
situation
not
to
be
too
thin
skinned
through
this
affair
i
got
on
record
at
the
post
as
reliable
and
ever
afterwards
my
word
was
taken
in
preference
to
any
reports
against
me
i
was
kept
tolerably
busy
watching
and
defending
the
rights
of
the
indians
also
in
trying
to
correct
evils
existing
among
the
natives
one
thing
that
taxed
all
my
ability
was
to
break
up
witchcraft
their
main
superstition
both
maricopas
and
pimas
fully
believed
that
all
sickness
and
calamities
of
any
kind
were
caused
by
witches
their
witch
doctors
claim
the
power
to
divine
who
the
witches
are
when
this
is
done
all
hands
turn
out
with
clubs
and
stones
and
kill
the
poor
wretch
pointed
out
whenever
there
is
much
sickness
among
them
some
one
has
to
die
as
a
witch
this
i
had
endeavored
to
check
by
teaching
them
better
but
i
soon
learned
that
my
teaching
had
not
reached
the
desire
as
witches
were
killed
among
those
settling
with
us
of
the
maricopas
i
went
to
their
camp
and
told
old
malia
who
was
quite
intelligent
in
many
respects
that
if
such
an
act
occurred
again
that
i
would
deliver
them
to
the
law
to
be
dealt
with
as
murderers
at
the
same
time
explaining
to
his
people
the
general
laws
of
health
showing
them
that
the
violation
of
natural
laws
produced
sickness
some
time
after
this
a
maricopa
woman
came
and
told
my
wife
that
the
maricopas
had
decided
to
kill
me
that
the
witches
were
killing
their
children
and
that
i
would
not
allow
them
to
kill
the
witches
so
the
only
way
to
protect
the
lives
of
their
children
would
be
to
kill
me
as
i
was
a
friend
of
the
witches
when
i
came
home
my
wife
told
me
of
this
threat
she
seemed
a
little
concerned
for
my
welfare
but
her
faith
was
always
with
mine
so
we
decided
that
it
would
be
best
for
me
to
go
at
once
and
put
a
stop
to
this
feeling
i
got
on
my
horse
and
went
alone
some
three
miles
to
their
camp
most
of
the
indians
were
gathered
together
as
i
approached
none
spoke
all
were
sullen
this
confirmed
to
me
the
truth
of
the
squaw
report
as
the
indians
generally
met
me
in
a
friendly
manner
i
went
directly
to
the
subject
told
them
what
i
had
heard
saying
to
them
that
i
had
no
fears
of
their
killing
me
and
that
there
was
no
use
for
them
to
entertain
any
such
feeling
towards
me
for
i
was
their
friend
and
teaching
them
the
truth
and
that
god
would
protect
me
i
again
talked
to
them
a
long
time
and
finally
seemed
to
gain
some
influence
the
pimas
had
also
been
guilty
of
the
same
practice
when
i
heard
of
this
i
took
a
good
interpreter
and
went
to
their
camp
which
was
across
the
river
among
the
old
settlers
not
of
our
colonizers
i
had
to
labor
long
and
hard
before
getting
any
satisfactory
results
the
old
chief
acknowledged
that
they
had
killed
one
witch
and
had
almost
killed
another
who
had
recovered
and
that
they
were
then
doctoring
him
to
cure
him
so
that
all
hands
could
turn
out
and
kill
him
better
i
asked
how
they
knew
these
men
were
witches
the
answer
was
that
the
doctor
had
pointed
them
out
i
asked
to
see
this
doctor
this
was
declined
i
insisted
telling
the
chief
that
i
would
neither
befriend
him
nor
his
people
nor
talk
to
them
about
anything
more
until
this
doctor
was
shown
me
this
the
old
fellow
did
not
like
for
i
had
done
them
much
good
already
and
was
continually
watching
and
protecting
their
interests
they
all
knew
this
and
appreciated
the
same
numbers
of
the
old
men
gathered
around
chatting
together
i
continued
to
repeat
my
request
to
see
the
doctor
finally
he
was
brought
out
i
managed
after
talking
a
long
time
to
really
convince
these
indians
that
it
was
wrong
to
believe
in
witches
or
at
least
to
kill
them
they
agreed
to
quit
the
practice
and
i
had
reason
to
believe
that
they
were
partially
converted
at
least
for
the
poor
fellow
who
had
been
almost
killed
came
to
my
ranch
a
few
weeks
after
this
he
was
terribly
banged
up
but
as
soon
as
he
could
possibly
travel
he
came
to
let
me
know
that
i
had
saved
him
that
his
people
had
agreed
not
to
kill
him
and
that
he
would
always
call
himself
my
boy
as
i
had
saved
his
life
many
persons
were
jealous
of
my
influence
with
the
natives
and
wondered
how
i
managed
to
obtain
so
much
power
over
them
i
simply
acted
as
a
friend
and
the
indians
knew
this
one
circumstance
i
will
relate
that
will
explain
a
little
of
this
power
there
was
one
of
our
white
settlers
who
had
lost
his
only
cow
she
was
running
on
the
river
bottom
near
the
indian
camp
at
the
time
this
occurred
the
commander
at
mcdowell
was
captain
norval
a
rather
impetuous
officer
a
letter
was
sent
to
this
officer
stating
that
the
indians
had
stolen
and
killed
the
only
cow
that
a
poor
man
had
and
calling
on
him
to
come
and
redress
the
wrong
accordingly
captain
norval
soon
appeared
at
the
head
of
some
dragoons
went
to
mesa
city
and
wrote
an
order
to
be
delivered
to
the
indians
through
me
that
the
cow
had
to
be
produced
or
paid
for
within
six
hours
or
he
would
kill
the
last
indian
to
be
found
the
indians
accused
lived
across
the
river
which
was
now
very
high
i
immediately
sent
a
courier
for
the
old
chief
to
come
to
my
ranch
also
informing
him
of
the
charge
the
old
man
came
as
soon
as
possible
having
to
swim
the
river
he
was
quite
old
and
feeble
but
managed
to
get
over
with
the
help
of
some
younger
men
captain
norval
soon
made
his
appearance
and
with
something
of
a
flourish
reiterated
his
threat
the
old
chief
looked
at
him
in
a
dazed
manner
then
asked
if
the
captain
wanted
them
to
pay
for
the
cow
when
they
knew
nothing
about
her
no
but
you
have
stolen
the
cow
and
killed
and
eaten
her
and
you
have
got
to
pay
for
her
or
i
will
turn
my
soldiers
loose
on
you
who
says
we
killed
this
man
cow
this
letter
says
so
that
letter
lies
we
know
nothing
about
the
cow
it
would
be
better
for
us
if
we
had
killed
her
for
we
could
then
confess
and
pay
for
her
but
how
can
we
confess
and
pay
for
what
we
know
nothing
about
the
captain
then
asked
what
had
become
of
the
cow
the
old
chief
said
he
did
not
know
positively
but
thought
perhaps
he
could
tell
he
said
the
day
the
cow
was
lost
there
had
been
a
sudden
rise
in
the
river
the
water
coming
down
so
suddenly
that
the
cow
being
on
an
island
was
probably
washed
way
and
drowned
the
old
man
was
so
simple
and
straightforward
in
all
his
talk
that
captain
norval
became
convinced
that
he
was
truthful
and
that
the
charge
was
more
malicious
than
reasonable
there
was
scarcely
a
week
passed
but
what
there
were
miserable
petty
charges
brought
against
the
indians
often
on
the
slightest
grounds
that
had
to
be
met
chapter

begin
to

soon
after
the
events
just
narrated
occurred
major
chaffee
took
command
at
camp
mcdowell
he
soon
took
in
the
situation
and
took
an
interest
in
the
welfare
and
rights
of
the
indians
to
him
more
than
any
one
else
is
owing
the
preservation
of
the
indian
rights
and
the
final
allowing
of
the
lands
to
these
people
i
will
give
one
more
especial
account
and
then
go
on
i
could
write
a
book
on
the
doings
of
salt
river
labors
but
have
not
room
in
this
for
more
than
a
few
items
once
the
spirit
ran
so
high
against
the
indians
that
it
was
determined
to
drive
them
away
unless
they
came
to
such
terms
as
the
whites
should
dictate
a
mass
meeting
was
called
to
meet
at
tempe
for
both
whites
and
natives
at
the
time
it
was
hardly
safe
for
me
to
appear
as
my
life
had
been
threatened
i
had
even
been
told
to
my
face
by
a
captain
sharp
that
he
was
ready
to
help
put
the
rope
around
my
neck
any
day
however
i
went
to
the
meeting
many
demands
were
made
of
the
indians
all
of
which
they
acceded
to
that
was
possible
for
them
to
do
the
whites
were
about
satisfied
with
the
disposition
of
the
indians
when
one
man
got
up
and
said
he
had
a
saddle
stolen
from
him
some
two
years
previous
and
that
he
would
not
consent
for
the
indians
to
remain
longer
where
they
were
unless
they
paid
for
the
saddle
at
this
several
others
commenced
telling
what
they
had
lost
and
demanded
the
same
i
had
kept
perfectly
silent
during
the
whole
parley
now
when
this
was
explained
to
the
indians
they
seemed
at
a
loss
what
to
say
finally
the
chief
said
they
were
not
able
to
pay
for
these
things
that
it
was
asking
more
than
they
could
do
the
spirit
of
the
whites
was
really
devilish
they
seemed
determined
to
drive
the
indians
to
the
wall
not
one
had
spoken
a
word
in
their
behalf
i
now
felt
impelled
to
speak
when
i
asked
to
be
heard
there
were
many
hard
looks
given
me
the
chairman
gave
consent
as
soon
as
i
commenced
some
one
interrupted
me
i
sat
down
the
chairman
called
for
order
i
then
said
if
you
gentlemen
will
hear
me
through
without
interruption
allowing
me
free
speech
i
will
talk
when
i
get
through
my
life
is
in
your
hands
do
with
me
as
you
please
but
i
will
not
talk
unless
you
agree
to
let
me
say
just
what
i
please
they
took
a
vote
to
hear
me
through
my
defense
of
the
indians
was
to
the
point
i
told
the
whites
that
they
demanded
of
the
natives
what
none
of
them
could
do
that
if
they
were
required
to
make
all
their
wrongs
right
that
they
had
committed
for
the
last
two
years
it
would
bankrupt
them
morally
and
financially
there
were
other
thieves
in
the
country
beside
indian
thieves
that
may
have
stolen
the
articles
i
referred
to
the
virtue
and
honesty
of
the
pimas
when
the
whites
first
came
among
them
showing
that
all
their
vile
degradation
and
dishonesty
was
copied
from
the
white
man
also
that
many
now
present
were
corrupt
and
immoral
much
more
so
than
the
average
indian
congressman
stephens
was
present
i
never
heard
what
he
thought
of
my
speech
but
i
conquered
the
most
present
and
they
agreed
to
let
the
indians
have
another
trial
all
of
these
men
finally
became
my
friends
this
meeting
just
described
was
with
the
indians
the
old
settlers
on
the
north
side
of
the
river
those
settling
on
the
utah
ditch
were
not
called
in
question
at
this
time
by
the
persons
seeking
to
drive
the
others
away
to
make
it
more
easy
for
the
reader
to
understand
i
will
speak
of
the
indians
as
north
side
and
south
side
the
north
side
being
those
who
were
settled
there
by
invitation
of
the
whites
before
our
colony
settled
on
salt
river
all
the
control
or
influence
i
had
over
them
was
simply
as
their
friend
the
south
side
settlers
were
those
who
had
colonized
on
lands
watered
by
the
utah
ditch
they
were
commonly
known
as
jones
indians
the
enemies
that
the
latter
had
to
meet
were
many
of
the
settlers
their
immediate
neighbors
many
and
various
attempts
were
made
to
have
them
driven
back
to
the
agency
parties
who
bought
shares
in
the
utah
ditch
as
well
as
some
of
the
original
owners
disputed
the
right
of
the
indians
to
water
although
they
had
done
a
large
portion
of
the
original
work
and
were
always
the
most
ready
workers
in
making
repairs
these
efforts
to
rob
the
indians
of
their
just
rights
had
a
tendency
to
discourage
the
poor
people
from
making
improvements
that
they
otherwise
would
have
done
the
question
of
the
indians
rights
to
water
finally
became
so
hardly
contested
that
i
applied
to
major
chaffee
to
cause
an
investigation
to
be
made
and
protect
the
indians
in
their
rights
i
had
kept
sufficient
account
of
their
work
to
show
conclusively
that
they
were
entitled
to
water
a
commissioner
was
sent
to
make
some
preliminary
enquiries
most
of
the
share
holders
claimed
that
the
indians
had
no
legal
right
in
the
ditch
which
was
a
fact
technically
speaking
as
no
transfers
had
been
made
to
them
simply
verbally
promised
that
by
doing
their
share
of
work
from
year
to
year
that
they
could
have
water
every
season
some
one
would
try
to
break
this
arrangement
and
i
determined
to
put
a
stop
to
it
a
meeting
of
the
share
holders
was
called
to
take
testimony
to
send
to
this
commissioner
for
the
decision
to
be
based
upon
at
this
meeting
i
was
threatened
with
the
penitentiary
if
i
established
a
claim
for
the
indians
the
party
who
made
the
threat
said
he
thought
he
had
bought
unencumbered
shares
in
the
ditch
from
me
others
claimed
the
same
now
the
facts
were
that
each
and
every
one
who
bought
shares
in
the
utah
ditch
or
lands
from
me
agreed
to
honor
and
assist
in
every
way
to
help
carry
out
the
work
of
helping
the
indians
some
betrayed
their
trust
in
a
most
dishonorable
and
unreasonable
way
my
answer
was
that
the
indians
should
be
protected
prison
or
no
prison
it
was
finally
agreed
by
all
the
shareholders
that
if
i
would
cease
to
press
the
matter
farther
and
sign
the
paper
with
the
rest
reporting
that
the
indians
had
no
legal
right
all
hands
would
agree
to
set
apart
a
certain
portion
of
water
measured
through
a
and
sign
an
agreement
allowing
the
indians
perpetual
use
of
that
share
on
certain
conditions
after
these
conditions
were
agreed
upon
and
a
committee
appointed
that
i
had
confidence
in
to
see
to
the
dividing
of
the
water
i
signed
the
report
with
the
rest
this
i
thought
best
to
do
at
the
timer
reserving
the
right
however
that
if
the
whites
ever
broke
faith
with
the
indians
i
would
seek
to
protect
them
at
all
hazards
this
contract
has
been
measurably
kept
with
more
or
less
grumbling
from
some
of
the
shareholders
the
lands
the
indians
occupied
i
had
secured
to
them
the
best
i
could
by
having
my
sons
claim
some
of
it
in
their
names
one
was
secured
by
purchase
from
a
mexican
who
settled
on
a
forty
allowing
the
indians
the
balance
i
bought
the
mexican
out
and
sold
the
forty
to
a
supposed
friend
with
the
understanding
that
he
was
to
use
the
forty
and
let
the
indians
have
the
balance
as
formerly
agreed
upon
this
agreement
was
broken
the
party
told
the
indians
that
i
had
sold
the
whole
to
him
and
agreed
to
drive
them
off
the
poor
indians
believed
him
and
gave
up
the
land
when
the
good
friend
sold
the
whole
to
a
third
party
who
knew
nothing
of
the
facts
the
indians
felt
very
badly
towards
me
about
this
i
knew
nothing
of
the
transaction
until
too
late
to
remedy
the
wrong
this
same
man
gave
testimony
against
me
afterwards
stating
that
i
had
sold
the
whole
and
i
had
to
pay
the
indians
for
dispossessing
them
it
now
became
the
popular
idea
to
try
to
jump
the
indians
lands
the
indians
on
the
north
side
were
threatened
with
land
jumpers
from
phoenix
and
tempe
one
party
moved
on
their
lands
taking
tools
surveying
outfit
provisions
and
went
to
work
just
as
though
no
indians
were
around
there
were
quite
a
number
of
them
they
had
sent
their
teams
back
home
the
indians
gathered
around
them
and
in
a
manner
loaded
all
their
stuff
into
their
wagons
then
by
main
force
of
numbers
picked
up
the
whites
loaded
them
on
top
of
the
loading
then
seized
the
wagons
by
hand
and
hauled
the
whole
outfit
off
from
their
lands
laughing
and
joking
all
the
time
the
whites
dared
not
make
any
resistance
this
raised
a
big
excitement
and
armed
companies
commenced
to
gather
both
at
tempe
and
phoenix
it
looked
now
as
though
blood
would
be
shed
i
went
to
mcdowell
and
reported
to
major
chaffee
he
said
he
would
be
ready
at
five
notice
to
come
to
the
protection
of
the
indians
for
me
to
go
back
and
keep
watch
of
the
moves
and
let
him
know
the
minute
any
violence
was
offered
this
whole
business
was
broken
up
by
the
cunning
of
an
indian
who
lived
at
tempe
the
tempe
company
was
headed
by
a
captain
who
said
the
indians
had
broken
into
his
house
and
robbed
him
he
had
raised
a
great
excitement
and
quite
a
company
and
was
getting
ready
to
join
the
company
from
phoenix
to
make
war
on
the
indians
who
had
ran
them
off
from
their
lands
this
tempe
indian
was
standing
looking
at
captain
j
company
when
someone
asked
him
if
the
indians
had
really
broken
into
captain
j
house
juan
said
yes
what
made
them
do
it
juan
said
the
captain
owed
an
indian
for
his
squaw
and
would
not
pay
him
and
the
indian
had
got
into
the
captain
house
and
stole
his
breeches
to
pay
himself
at
this
the
company
turned
on
their
captain
gave
him
a
good
cursing
broke
ranks
and
went
about
their
business
this
soon
reached
the
phoenix
company
who
became
disgusted
and
broke
whether
juan
told
the
truth
or
not
it
answered
the
purpose
and
had
a
lasting
effect
for
most
every
one
believed
him
chapter

myself

interests

difficulties

own

demands

though
it
takes
my
home
major
chaffee
had
been
watching
the
efforts
of
the
whites
to
rob
the
natives
of
their
rights
he
had
reported
to
the
proper
department
the
condition
of
affairs
he
did
all
he
could
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
indians
i
kept
him
continually
posted
and
i
am
satisfied
that
without
his
oversight
of
affairs
the
indians
would
have
been
driven
away
and
the
work
among
them
on
salt
river
broken
up
one
piece
of
land
that
the
whites
had
attempted
to
take
from
the
indians
known
as
gironimo
farm
on
a
school
section
had
passed
from
one
claimant
to
another
each
one
threatening
that
they
would
hold
it
one
party
went
to
work
on
this
land
i
warned
him
off
and
got
a
good
cursing
a
few
days
after
this
he
in
an
exulting
manner
said
to
me
i
have
now
sold
this
land
to
and
got
my
pay
i
would
like
to
see
you
face
i
guess
you
dare
not
do
it
he
intends
to
put
his
teams
to
plowing
and
i
guess
you
will
have
to
give
up
this
time
as
soon
as
the
teams
started
to
plow
i
notified
the
young
men
to
stop
and
to
tell
their
father
that
he
could
not
occupy
the
land
this
considering
who
the
individual
was
was
considered
not
worth
noticing
and
the
plowing
continued
i
went
to
camp
and
reported
to
captain
chaffee
he
sent
a
note
saying
they
must
get
off
or
he
would
send
a
file
of
soldiers
to
put
them
off
went
off
captain
chaffee
had
recommended
the
setting
apart
the
lands
occupied
by
the
indians
as
reservations
after
much
labor
and
investigation
this
was
finally
done
president

including
phoenix

and
the
whole
country
occupied
by
the
whites
when
this
proclamation
came
out
there
was
a
rattling
among
the
dry
bones
all
were
astounded
the
flop
was
so
sudden
and
complete
from
daily
expecting
orders
to
come
to
send
the
indians
away
the
towns
fine
ranches
and
all
were
given
to
the
indians
many
were
puzzled
over
this
proclamation
not
knowing
but
what
it
was
intended
in
earnest
but
the
majority
knew
it
was
a
mistake
as
we
had
only
asked
for
the
lands
occupied
by
the
indians
there
was
now
a
complete
revulsion
of
feeling
toward
me
by
the
old
settlers
they
acknowledged
i
had
won
i
was
looked
upon
as
a
person
who
would
never
give
up
all
knew
i
had
made
the
fight
alone
during
the
whole
time
i
was
assisted
by
my
family
only
and
it
stands
on
the
record
in
the
books
of
the
settlement
that
my
labors
were
not
sustained
by
my
associates
so
for
this
reason
i
claim
the
right
to
speak
singly
i
would
rather
it
had
been
different
for
i
knew
good
works
had
been
done
by
others
but
as
they
have
placed
their
names
on
record
as
never
having
sustained
me
i
will
have
to
let
them
take
their
choice
as
bungling
as
i
may
have
been
i
got
the
indians
their
lands
it
was
nearly
a
year
before
things
were
straightened
up
and
put
to
rights
finally
president
hayes
modified
the
grant
giving
the
indians
only
the
lands
they
occupied
during
the
whole
of
this
time
the
indians
were
steadily
improving
their
farms
helping
to
enlarge
the
ditch
and
generally
advancing
in
good
behavior
and
with
a
few
exceptions
becoming
moral
and
industrious
raising
good
crops
selling
large
quantities
of
wheat
and
sustaining
themselves
without
help
from
anyone
once
our
place
was
visited
by
an
indian
inspector
who
reported
the
indians
in
a
better
condition
than
any
on
the
government
reservations
many
had
been
baptized
i
had
by
this
time
become
quite
unpopular
among
those
who
i
thought
ought
to
be
my
friends
i
had
gotten
into
the
habit
of
resisting
every
one
who
opposed
my
labors
with
the
natives
such
seemed
like
an
enemy
when
i
saw
the
indians
firmly
established
on
their
lands
i
desired
to
sell
out
and
go
on
to
mexico
persons
were
appointed
from
time
to
time
to
take
my
place
with
the
pimas
but
little
progress
was
made
until
my
eldest
son
daniel
was
placed
in
charge
of
them
a
school
house
was
built
and
some
few
now
took
an
interest
in
helping
along
the
work
sisters
susanna
brady
susan
savage
and
a
sister
harmon
formerly
of
the
sixteenth
ward
salt
lake
city
commenced
teaching
the
children
who
made
rapid
progress
many
of
them
at
this
time
can
read
in
the
third
and
fourth
readers
calculate
figures
and
write
a
very
good
hand
sister
harmon
has
taught
them
music
many
of
the
young
people
are
good
singers
one
having
learned
to
play
the
organ
many
of
the
older
natives
are
intelligent
and
often
speak
in
meeting
with
much
force
and
understanding
an
effort
was
made
by
a
company
to
buy
me
out
but
not
being
able
to
agree
among
themselves
it
failed
my
farm
was
quite
valuable
from
the
products
of
it
i
had
paid
most
of
the
old
debts
i
now
concluded
to
make
salt
river
my
home
improve
my
place
and
live
in
peace
as
i
had
done
all
i
could
for
the
indians
i
gave
up
all
pretence
of
having
any
control
or
management
of
any
kind
whatever
over
their
affairs
farther
than
to
be
friendly
and
give
them
such
advice
as
a
friend
could
i
supposed
this
would
be
satisfactory
and
end
all
trouble
but
in
this
i
was
mistaken
one
day
while
at
work
plowing
on
a
ranch
some
four
miles
from
home
one
of
my
sons
brought
me
a
note
stating
that
the
indians
had
made
complaint
against
some
of
the
settlers
and
that
the
charge
was
being
investigated
and
that
i
was
wanted
as
a
witness
i
had
heard
of
no
trouble
lately
and
could
not
call
to
mind
anything
wherein
the
indians
had
a
right
to
complain
my
supposition
was
that
it
was
some
difficulty
that
had
taken
place
in
my
absence
as
i
had
been
away
from
home
several
days
i
wrote
a
note
to
the
bishop
who
was
to
conduct
the
investigation
saying
that
i
had
no
knowledge
of
any
unsettled
difficulties
between
the
indians
and
whites
and
that
i
was
not
at
present
paying
any
attention
to
indian
affairs
and
could
not
possibly
call
to
mind
anything
that
would
make
my
evidence
needed
but
if
there
was
to
please
send
me
word
by
my
son
and
i
would
come
immediately
i
went
on
with
my
plowing
thinking
nothing
more
about
the
matter
soon
my
son
wesley
came
at
full
gallop
looking
quite
excited
i
asked
him
what
was
the
matter
he
replied
they
are
going
to
cut
you
off
from
the
church
i
heard
them
say
so
i
asked
did
they
send
you
to
tell
me
no
but
i
heard
what
they
said
and
came
as
fast
as
i
could
to
tell
you
but
i
do
know
what
they
mean
i
jumped
on
the
horse
and
got
to
the
place
as
soon
as
possible
where
the
trial
was
going
on
but
they
had
adjourned
i
wrote
a
note
to
the
bishop
immediately
stating
that
i
wished
to
make
satisfaction
if
i
had
offended
as
i
had
not
intended
to
in
answer
i
received
the
following
jonesville
april
understanding
that
you
desire
to
appear
in
the
bishop
court
and
apologize
for
your
disregard
to
our
notice
sent
you
to
attend
and
give
testimony
we
will
be
in
session
tomorrow
at
at
the
at
which
time
you
can
avail
yourself
of
the
bishop
before
the
time
of
meeting
next
day
i
learned
to
my
surprise
that
the
whole
business
was
against
myself
that
i
was
being
tried
for
robbing
indians
of
their
lands
this
to
me
was
so
unjust
so
unreasonable
and
in
every
way
malicious
that
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
make
no
defence
whatever
but
let
the
prosecutors
go
on
and
submit
to
whatever
decision
they
gave
my
reasons
for
this
were
that
i
knew
there
was
a
deep
prejudice
against
me
not
entirely
without
cause
and
the
only
way
for
me
to
break
it
up
would
be
to
submit
to
the
parties
who
were
trying
to
drive
me
to
the
wall
next
day
i
appeared
and
asked
forgiveness
for
not
coming
at
the
first
notice
a
motion
was
made
to
forgive
me
before
this
was
put
to
vote
i
asked
to
make
a
statement
so
that
my
feelings
would
be
fully
understood
that
was
that
i
should
not
have
testified
if
i
had
been
at
the
former
hearing
that
i
was
now
here
according
to
their
notice
but
that
i
declined
to
make
any
defence
whatever
the
tribunal
seemed
puzzled
to
know
what
to
do
with
me
but
finally
decided
that
i
must
make
some
more
confessions
this
i
agreed
to
do
at
a
public
meeting
when
the
time
came
i
made
my
apology
which
was
all
right
for
the
time
and
place
but
a
still
greater
humiliation
was
wanted
this
i
also
agreed
to
during
these
exercises
my
robbery
case
was
being
taken
under
advisement
however
i
guess
it
will
be
as
well
to
get
through
the
confession
while
about
it
now
i
do
not
wish
any
one
to
think
that
my
apologies
were
not
sincere
i
fully
realized
that
i
had
been
disrespectful
for
i
really
had
no
respect
for
the
whole
proceedings
the
last
decision
was
that
i
was
to
apologize
before
the
whole
ward
and
make
full
and
complete
satisfaction
to
all
present
at
the
appointed
time
i
stood
up
and
did
the
best
i
could
but
was
told
that
it
was
not
satisfactory
i
then
asked
that
a
paper
be
prepared
just
what
would
satisfy
and
i
would
endorse
it
this
was
agreed
to
and
under
instructions
the
clerk
commenced
to
write
i
was
standing
but
was
asked
to
take
a
seat
i
declined
as
i
had
the
floor
and
was
determined
to
keep
it
until
the
business
was
finished
finally
after
many
failures
a
satisfactory
confession
was
written
out
and
read
i
signed
the
same
with
my
own
free
will
and
consent
there
was
nothing
in
the
requirement
but
what
was
reasonable
under
the
circumstances
i
find
by
the
date
of
the
decision
against
me
that
it
was
given
before
the
last
confession
as
that
could
not
possibly
have
taken
place
within
three
days
from
the
appeal
this
is
a
copy
of
the
decision
given
april
it
is
the
decision
of
the
bishop
court
that
you
pay
the
receivers
the
sum
of
three
hundred
dollars
for
dispossessing
indians
of
their
lands
said
sum
to
be
paid
on
or
before
the
of
april
and
if
not
paid
by
that
time
you
shall
be
cut
off
from
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
saints
i
made
up
my
mind
to
abide
the
decision
without
appealing
it
a
short
time
before
this
trouble
brother
snow
had
visited
salt
river
and
had
so
i
understood
caused
to
be
settled
some
feelings
that
had
existed
for
some
time
past
between
myself
and
others
i
had
in
good
faith
agreed
to
work
in
unison
with
the
authorities
of
the
stake
and
had
been
doing
my
best
to
prove
my
sincerity
when
this
decision
was
given
i
went
to
the
president
of
the
stake
and
showed
it
to
him
he
expressed
himself
surprised
saying
that
he
had
always
thought
me
about
the
indians
rights
he
said
i
could
appeal
it
i
told
him
it
would
take
time
and
trouble
and
i
felt
like
paying
the
fine
and
letting
the
matter
rest
but
that
i
feared
there
was
a
disposition
to
crowd
me
the
time
was
so
short
only
ten
days
allowed
and
that
money
was
scarce
and
hard
to
get
he
replied
that
all
that
could
be
expected
was
for
me
to
consent
and
pay
as
soon
as
i
could
i
told
him
i
feared
not
as
the
whole
proceeding
showed
malice
i
went
back
home
and
wrote
the
bishop
a
letter
saying
that
i
would
abide
the
decision
and
that
he
could
take
charge
of
a
lot
of
wagons
and
stock
which
myself
and
sons
owned
that
were
now
at
home
on
the
ranch
i
gave
a
list
of
the
same
and
they
were
worth
over
one
thousand
dollars
i
told
him
he
could
take
charge
of
the
whole
of
it
or
that
he
could
pick
and
receive
sufficient
to
cover
the
fine
and
i
would
hold
myself
in
readiness
to
assist
under
his
counsel
to
get
the
money
out
of
the
property
if
my
offer
was
not
properly
worded
i
would
sign
any
agreement
that
might
be
required
of
me
but
when
the
letter
was
read
one
party
remarked
jones
has
followed
his
rule
and
gone
contrary
to
what
we
expected
chapter
li
i
remove
to
tonto
basin
death
by
accident
of
my
wife
and
child
return
to
salt
river
my
official
duties
there
trip
to
old
mexico
my
offer
was
unfavorably
received
and
i
was
told
to
have
the
cash
ready
to
pay
by
the
time
named
i
counseled
with
those
who
presided
over
me
and
though
the
advice
i
received
was
contrary
to
my
ideas
of
justice
and
right
i
followed
it
though
it
was
at
the
complete
sacrifice
of
my
home
acquired
by
years
of
toil
and
hardship
i
was
determined
to
retain
my
standing
in
the
church
at
any
cost
and
leave
judgment
with
the
lord
who
will
eventually
deal
out
strict
justice
to
all
men
i
was
so
much
used
up
now
that
i
felt
like
hiding
up
for
the
balance
of
my
days
i
settled
up
my
affairs
in
salt
river
and
moved
to
tonto
basin
where
but
few
people
could
live
the
place
being
small
i
commenced
to
make
me
a
farm
and
fix
for
a
quiet
life
my
family
were
kind
and
good
to
me
my
wife
was
one
of
the
noblest
and
best
women
that
ever
lived
and
was
so
acknowledged
by
all
who
knew
her
on
settling
in
tonto
my
nature
was
to
improve
i
soon
got
started
an
extension
of
the
public
ditch
and
a
road
to
the
lumber
region
my
wife
assisted
in
organizing
a
relief
society
and
everything
seemed
prosperous
for
future
peace
and
happiness
but
my
misfortunes
were
only
commenced
during
the
winter
it
rained
almost
incessantly
we
were
living
in
a
large
tent
with
a
shed
in
front
one
day
during
a
storm
this
shed
fell
killing
my
wife
and
babe
two
years
old
she
was
the
mother
of
fourteen
children
but
seemed
just
in
the
prime
of
life
and
vigor
all
i
will
say
is
that
for
over
a
year
i
would
have
been
glad
to
have
died
i
could
not
remain
in
the
place
after
this
so
i
went
back
to
salt
river
settled
in
tempe
built
a
nice
little
house
and
furnished
it
up
completely
brother
johnson
a
neighbor
asked
me
one
day
why
i
was
so
particular
to
finish
my
house
so
thoroughly
i
replied
we
are
promised
many
fold
for
all
we
sacrifice
for
the
gospel
sake
i
have
given
up
several
houses
for
the
gospel
sake
and
if
i
have
to
take
them
all
back
multiplied
i
want
one
decent
place
to
live
in
while
i
finish
them
up
speaking
of
brother
johnson
reminds
me
of
a
circumstance
that
he
will
remember
one
day
he
and
i
were
together
when
brother
milton
rey
who
had
been
some
time
laboring
among
the
indians
at
jonesville
came
riding
up
to
us
in
a
hurried
excited
manner
he
said
that
he
had
just
learned
something
greatly
to
my
advantage
that
he
had
been
talking
to
the
indians
and
they
had
told
him
that
i
had
never
wronged
them
in
any
way
and
that
it
was
all
a
mistake
he
wanted
me
to
go
immediately
with
him
and
get
a
on
all
charges
brought
against
me
i
was
really
amused
at
his
earnestness
as
was
also
brother
johnson
brother
rey
could
not
understand
why
i
did
not
take
more
interest
in
what
he
was
telling
me
until
i
explained
to
him
that
i
was
well
aware
that
through
prejudice
and
not
through
guilt
had
i
been
condemned
there
were
a
few
unworthy
indians
whom
i
had
to
correct
from
time
to
time
they
might
have
said
something
against
me
when
prompted
to
do
so
but
the
indians
as
a
body
always
honored
me
more
than
any
one
else
and
do
so
to
this
day
after
getting
my
house
finished
in
tempe
and
moving
my
children
from
tonto
i
concluded
to
go
ahead
and
do
the
best
i
could
to
make
myself
useful
the
school
district
one
of
the
oldest
and
richest
in
the
country
had
one
of
the
poorest
school
houses
owing
to
the
former
trustees
not
being
able
to
understand
the
laws
alike
as
there
were
now
many
mormons
living
in
the
district
it
was
proposed
that
they
should
have
a
representative
i
was
chosen
for
this
place
the
other
two
agreed
to
sustain
me
in
building
a
good
school
house
we
soon
made
arrangements
and
one
of
the
best
houses
in
the
county
was
speedily
erected
and
ready
for
use
i
was
also
appointed
to
take
the
school
census
of
the
district
and
to
be
assistant
assessor
for
the
mesa
and
jonesville
districts
these
active
services
helped
me
somewhat
to
bear
the
grief
for
the
loss
of
my
wife
during
the
summer
of
my
mind
often
rested
on
mexico
and
the
obligation
i
felt
resting
upon
me
not
to
give
up
my
mission
in
that
country
i
tried
to
rid
my
mind
of
these
reflections
but
could
not
i
remembered
that
i
had
agreed
with
brother
brigham
and
george
smith
to
stick
to
the
mission
so
long
as
i
lived
i
remembered
that
brother
smith
talked
to
me
about
this
mission
even
after
we
had
to
shake
him
every
few
minutes
to
keep
him
awake
so
that
he
would
breathe
by
force
of
will
i
was
with
him
daily
just
before
his
death
once
he
said
to
me
that
he
would
like
to
live
to
help
in
the
mexican
mission
brother
brigham
letter
directing
me
to
go
on
to
one
of
the
spots
where
israel
would
sooner
or
later
gather
would
come
to
my
mind
again
i
remembered
that
brother
brigham
had
told
me
that
during
my
mission
there
would
be
times
when
i
would
seemingly
be
surrounded
with
a
high
strong
stone
wall
and
in
which
there
would
appear
no
opening
but
said
he
do
kick
at
it
for
you
will
only
make
your
toes
sore
be
faithful
and
in
time
it
will
be
removed
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
i
had
forgotten
the
counsel
not
to
kick
for
i
had
been
kicking
at
this
very
wall
and
had
got
my
toes
terribly
broken
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
and
quit
finally
the
spirit
and
desire
became
so
strong
to
visit
mexico
that
i
could
not
resist
the
feeling
my
children
needed
what
we
had
left
for
their
support
so
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
would
go
if
i
had
to
make
the
trip
on
foot
at
this
time
the
land
committee
was
working
in
mexico
i
often
met
some
of
them
but
all
seemed
to
avoid
receiving
any
information
from
me
this
was
not
at
all
strange
for
i
knew
that
i
was
looked
upon
as
rebellious
as
my
side
of
the
story
had
never
been
heard
about
the
time
that
i
was
thinking
of
starting
there
was
an
old
miner
from
utah
came
to
my
house
with
a
good
traveling
outfit
and
wished
to
go
to
mexico
he
offered
to
take
me
through
if
i
would
furnish
a
certain
amount
of
horse
feed
and
provisions
and
assist
him
as
interpreter
in
getting
through
the
custom
house
and
get
him
introduced
to
some
of
the
mine
owners
in
mexico
i
had
heard
some
little
about
this
man
and
had
met
him
many
years
past
in
utah
he
made
me
such
fair
offers
that
i
concluded
to
go
along
with
him
as
the
most
that
i
cared
for
was
to
get
to
mexico
with
my
saddler
tools
with
them
i
knew
i
would
be
safe
for
expenses
at
any
rate
my
main
desire
was
to
get
to
the
district
of
country
and
see
what
shape
the
spot
was
in
that
brother
brigham
had
approved
while
in
provo
one
time
brother
brigham
in
presence
of
brother
cannon
and
others
took
a
map
and
motioning
his
finger
around
over
the
map
settled
onto
this
very
place
and
said
here
is
a
gathering
place
for
the
saints
i
knew
the
place
but
had
never
pointed
it
out
to
brother
brigham
i
had
never
been
on
the
land
but
had
been
within
a
few
miles
of
it
and
had
heard
a
full
description
of
the
place
knowing
the
desire
was
to
get
land
in
mexico
i
naturally
supposed
that
now
was
the
time
to
get
this
place
secured
provided
it
was
for
sale
so
i
determined
to
go
and
find
out
and
at
the
same
time
put
myself
in
the
way
of
giving
such
information
as
i
had
formerly
obtained
while
in
mexico
i
had
heard
that
the
committee
were
trying
to
get
lands
from
the
government
or
land
companies
which
amounted
to
the
same
this
i
fully
believed
would
fail
having
faith
in
the
report
given
us
while
on
our
mission
to
mexico
by
the
old
governor
and
accepted
by
president
young
also
knowing
that
the
of
the
country
would
make
but
slight
difference
in
the
conditions
having
all
this
before
me
i
hoped
to
go
down
and
be
of
some
use
the
trip
through
was
made
without
any
accident
occurring
worth
mentioning
my
companion
seemed
wholy
absorbed
in
mining
speculations
something
i
had
never
taken
any
interest
in
nor
wished
to
when
we
arrived
at
ascencion
i
found
quite
a
number
of
our
people
camped
there
some
of
them
had
been
on
the
ground
for
some
time
waiting
for
the
land
purchase
to
be
made
while
here
the
miner
with
whom
i
was
traveling
and
who
agreed
to
take
me
on
to
guerero
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
farther
heard
of
some
new
mines
purporting
to
be
very
rich
that
had
lately
been
discovered
they
were
not
far
out
of
our
way
and
he
wished
to
go
by
and
see
them
and
agreed
if
he
wished
to
stay
there
to
let
me
have
the
team
to
go
on
and
not
detain
me
over
three
days
we
went
to
the
place
sabinal
quite
an
excitement
was
up
rich
prospects
being
found
daily
we
made
camp
and
i
commenced
to
get
dinner
my
companion
went
prospecting
and
soon
returned
with
some
small
pieces
of
rock
and
a
big
grin
saying
that
he
had
struck
it
rich
he
could
scarcely
spend
time
to
eat
his
dinner
he
wanted
me
to
go
and
see
his
find
i
told
him
that
i
neither
knew
nor
cared
anything
about
mines
but
that
i
would
take
care
of
camp
and
the
team
and
he
could
go
and
finish
his
prospecting
we
were
about
six
miles
from
water
and
desired
to
go
there
for
camp
soon
returned
with
more
rock
he
was
an
old
prospector
and
really
understood
his
business
he
said
he
had
found
a
regular
lead
where
it
was
exposed
in
a
ravine
and
that
it
showed
very
rich
i
had
been
told
what
the
laws
were
in
regard
to
recording
discoveries
they
are
different
from
the
united
states
laws
no
monument
or
notice
is
of
any
use
as
soon
as
a
discovery
is
made
the
finder
must
go
and
put
the
same
on
record
the
one
first
recording
holds
the
claim
having
four
months
to
do
a
certain
amount
of
work
required
i
explained
this
to
the
miner
and
also
told
him
that
any
one
getting
to
the
recorder
ahead
of
him
could
take
his
discovery
we
were
with
traveling
carriage
and
miles
from
the
office
at
casas
grandes
there
was
a
horseback
trail
much
nearer
and
prospectors
out
in
every
direction
and
liable
to
run
into
this
vein
became
excited
and
we
started
for
casas
grandes
in
a
hurry
no
time
was
lost
on
arriving
there
i
helped
to
get
all
the
necessary
papers
made
out
and
found
a
person
to
see
that
all
was
straight
when
the
papers
were
all
filed
and
settled
showed
me
my
name
as
half
owner
in
the
find
and
said
you
are
now
a
rich
man
if
you
will
stick
to
me
a
few
days
you
will
soon
be
able
to
go
on
and
buy
your
land
provided
the
rock
assayed
as
much
as
he
believed
it
would
some
three
hundred
dollars
to
find
this
out
it
would
become
necessary
to
go
to
el
paso
some
two
hundred
miles
for
an
assay
again
i
was
persuaded
as
i
had
not
yet
got
to
the
district
i
desired
to
reach
reiterating
his
offer
that
as
soon
as
he
could
get
settled
to
mining
i
could
have
the
use
of
his
team
as
long
as
i
wished
to
go
on
my
land
business
so
we
went
back
to
the
discovery
which
was
on
our
road
to
el
paso
and
procured
some
three
hundred
pounds
of
ore
from
the
vein
i
helped
to
get
the
rock
the
vein
showed
well
when
we
arrived
in
el
paso
and
got
the
assay
it
showed
over
six
hundred
dollars
which
was
very
rich
we
had
no
trouble
in
getting
all
the
help
we
needed
to
work
the
mine
it
was
not
long
before
my
partner
showed
his
real
character
as
soon
as
the
means
were
secured
to
work
the
mine
and
he
needed
me
no
further
he
showed
a
murderous
spirit
i
now
made
up
my
mind
to
stay
with
him
the
four
months
and
get
my
rights
on
record
for
it
was
through
my
individual
influence
that
the
means
were
obtained
to
work
the
mine
i
had
to
watch
my
life
continually
during
the
four
months
not
daring
to
eat
or
sleep
with
my
partner
i
will
not
weary
the
reader
with
what
occurred
at
this
camp
it
would
be
rather
unpleasant
to
read
but
it
is
no
exaggeration
as
many
who
were
there
from
time
to
time
can
testify
to
say
that
my
life
was
in
danger
most
of
the
time
while
in
this
camp
when
i
got
my
rights
on
record
i
left
the
camp
appointed
a
representative
to
look
after
my
interests
according
to
the
laws
of
mexico
the
mine
was
quite
rich
turning
out
much
rich
ore
and
making
a
large
dump
of
ore
that
would
have
paid
to
freight
my
partner
spent
most
all
the
proceeds
in
high
living
and
spreeing
i
left
the
mine
in
disgust
and
have
never
made
an
enquiry
about
it
since
i
have
passed
in
sight
of
the
district
twice
since
while
on
land
business
and
never
cared
to
make
an
enquiry
concerning
either
the
mine
or
partner
chapter
lii
accidental
shooting
of
my
my
opinion
of
early
colonization
by
the
saints
i
go
on
an
exploring
trip
i
find
the
land
described
by
president
young
i
endeavor
to
make
a
purchase
but
fail
while
doing
the
assessment
work
one
of
my
sons
and
a
came
from
salt
river
to
help
me
my
john
brady
shot
himself
accidentally
by
dropping
a
pistol
he
died
of
the
wound
and
was
buried
near
the
camp
of
saints
at
ascencion
brother
jesse
steele
was
at
the
camp
at
the
time
and
helped
to
nurse
him
he
lived
eight
days
after
being
wounded
death
was
caused
by
the
bursting
of
an
artery
that
had
been
slightly
wounded
this
occurred
in
the
night
time
we
were
watching
as
usual
but
no
suspicion
of
the
bleeding
existed
until
he
was
too
far
gone
to
recruit
when
the
bleeding
was
stopped
this
was
hard
on
me
as
i
felt
toward
him
as
a
real
son
he
having
always
shown
me
much
kindness
during
these
four
months
i
often
visited
the
camp
of
the
saints
at
ascension
the
first
time
i
met
one
of
the
brethren
of
the
committee
he
asked
me
what
i
thought
of
their
proposed
land
purchase
i
said
that
i
believed
that
it
would
be
a
failure
when
i
was
asked
why
i
related
all
about
our
first
investigations
and
our
report
to
brother
brigham
saying
that
i
believed
we
reported
the
truth
and
that
if
the
present
efforts
succeeded
it
would
prove
our
reports
false
this
was
looked
on
more
as
an
insult
than
as
information
i
was
told
that
conditions
had
changed
since
the
time
of
our
visit
to
mexico
that
our
reports
might
have
been
all
right
at
the
time
but
would
not
apply
to
the
present
my
answer
to
this
was
that
i
recognized
the
face
of
the
country
as
being
just
the
same
as
formerly
that
mountains
and
valleys
were
all
in
place
that
i
saw
no
signs
of
earthquakes
having
changed
the
conditions
therefore
i
could
not
see
why
our
reports
if
true
then
were
not
true
now
i
soon
learned
that
any
information
that
i
might
offer
would
simply
be
looked
on
as
worthless
i
was
told
that
campos
who
was
the
agent
now
offering
them
lands
was
one
like
hiram
of
old
raised
up
for
the
salvation
of
the
people
i
answered
that
he
was
a
fraud
raised
up
to
swindle
them
out
of
their
money
i
was
severely
rebuked
for
this
remark
and
told
that
campos
had
been
introduced
and
vouched
for
in
a
letter
of
introduction
as
the
man
who
opened
the
first
door
to
the
elders
in
mexico
in
the
city
of
chihuahua
and
that
anything
i
might
think
or
say
would
avail
nothing
this
was
at
first
a
surprise
to
me
for
i
was
in
charge
of
chihuahua
at
the
time
and
never
heard
of
campos
but
i
learned
afterwards
that
he
was
a
police
officer
at
the
time
and
possibly
was
on
duty
the
evening
we
held
meeting
in
the
public
cock
pit
as
soon
as
i
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
i
could
do
no
good
here
i
made
up
my
mind
to
continue
on
my
first
effort
to
get
to
the
country
i
had
started
for
during
the
winter
and
spring
of
while
attending
to
the
mining
business
i
made
several
trips
to
el
paso
once
while
in
el
paso
i
met
brothers
erastus
snow
and
samuel
hill
who
were
on
their
way
to
the
city
of
mexico
on
business
of
importance
they
not
wishing
to
be
delayed
accepted
my
assistance
in
getting
their
luggage
checked
their
money
changed
and
other
services
that
helped
them
along
as
i
was
acquainted
with
the
officers
and
business
this
occurred
february
at
that
time
i
explained
to
brother
snow
my
desire
regarding
this
land
he
said
for
me
to
go
ahead
hoping
i
would
succeed
i
knew
that
it
would
take
considerable
money
to
visit
and
thoroughly
explore
the
country
i
desired
to
visit
the
products
of
the
mine
although
rich
as
before
stated
were
wasted
and
probably
would
continue
to
be
as
i
could
not
control
my
partner
without
going
into
law
and
this
would
be
ruinous
under
the
laws
of
mexico
i
happened
to
meet
a
gentleman
who
had
money
and
was
desirous
of
going
on
the
same
business
he
agreeing
to
bear
the
expenses
for
my
services
as
interpreter
etc
and
that
any
lands
found
that
might
be
wanted
by
the
mormons
was
to
be
entirely
under
my
control
i
now
went
home
to
salt
river
to
visit
my
children
and
prepare
for
the
trip
to
mexico
we
went
direct
to
the
city
of
chihuahua
soon
we
were
visited
by
different
land
speculators
offering
lands
we
visited
and
examined
various
ranches
some
as
far
down
as
the
southern
part
of
the
state
we
found
some
excellent
properties
at
reasonable
prices
but
paid
no
attention
to
the
worthless
lands
simply
examining
titled
properties
of
good
reputation
we
were
in
the
city
of
chihuahua
after
having
done
considerable
exploring
when
we
were
approached
by
a
man
who
described
a
piece
of
property
that
he
had
bonded
i
soon
became
convinced
that
from
the
description
and
locality
that
it
was
the
land
i
desired
to
find
when
we
were
alone
i
informed
my
friend
of
this
and
we
agreed
to
go
and
see
the
place
we
visited
the
parties
holding
the
lands
and
agreed
to
go
with
them
it
being
some
two
hundred
and
fifty
miles
from
chihuahua
and
in
the
district
approved
of
by
president
young
for
a
gathering
place
on
arriving
at
this
spot
i
felt
sure
that
i
had
now
found
the
place
wanted
without
further
description
i
will
say
that
it
is
the
most
beautiful
valley
that
i
ever
saw
fertile
soil
water
plentiful
and
timber
more
than
would
ever
be
used
the
whole
face
of
the
country
covered
with
the
best
of
grass
climate
mild
crops
are
raised
in
the
vicinity
without
irrigation
the
land
held
by
the
parties
was
for
sixty
days
only
the
question
now
was
for
me
to
try
and
get
this
secured
before
the
bond
ran
out
as
there
were
others
wanting
to
buy
this
piece
in
connection
with
a
large
tract
adjoining
it
from
another
party
the
owner
of
this
piece
i
wanted
was
a
friend
to
the
owner
of
the
large
tract
and
had
agreed
that
in
case
the
present
bond
ran
out
that
he
should
have
the
property
to
join
onto
his
larger
tract
the
owner
of
the
large
tract
had
already
entered
into
negotiations
with
a
third
party
to
sell
the
whole
provided
he
got
the
small
property
i
had
not
as
yet
learned
all
these
particulars
but
i
had
learned
enough
to
convince
me
that
if
the
property
was
not
secured
within
the
sixty
days
that
the
price
would
be
raised
at
least
from
what
i
had
learned
i
expected
that
brother
snow
would
be
at
the
new
colony
station
at
piedras
verdes
as
the
purchase
had
been
made
from
campos
and
the
people
were
now
moving
on
lands
they
supposed
belonged
to
the
purchase
but
afterwards
proved
to
be
a
portion
of
an
old
and
wellknown
ranch
known
as
sandiago
the
question
was
how
to
get
to
brother
snow
place
the
quickest
way
it
was
at
least
two
hundred
miles
distant
across
a
country
not
much
traveled
and
some
of
the
way
considered
dangerous
because
of
apaches
the
fear
that
the
mexicans
entertain
for
the
apaches
puts
me
in
mind
of
something
that
i
saw
when
i
was
a
small
boy
some
rude
boys
had
tied
a
tin
can
to
a
dog
tail
and
he
ran
by
yelping
soon
the
can
came
off
i
could
see
the
dog
running
with
all
his
might
for
a
long
ways
i
wondered
what
made
him
keep
running
when
nothing
now
was
to
his
tail
i
was
too
small
at
the
time
to
understand
that
he
was
still
scared
at
his
first
experience
the
mexicans
are
somewhat
the
same
to
this
day
they
are
slow
to
forget
past
experiences
and
seem
to
think
the
apaches
are
still
after
them
even
in
the
localities
where
none
have
been
seen
for
years
after
thoroughly
examining
the
land
we
went
to
the
county
seat
and
my
friend
procured
a
bond
for
the
sixty
days
we
then
started
back
east
toward
the
city
of
chihuahua
my
desired
route
lay
north
and
would
turn
off
at
temosechic
about
twenty
miles
from
where
we
were
on
arriving
at
temosechic
about
noon
i
got
out
of
our
traveling
carriage
with
my
blankets
and
saddle
bags
and
without
having
made
any
arrangements
whatever
for
the
trip
bade
to
my
traveling
companion
this
was
the
same
place
where
we
had
been
so
well
treated
ten
years
before
while
on
our
mission
i
had
perfect
faith
in
the
goodness
of
the
people
for
i
wished
to
take
the
same
route
that
we
had
come
out
on
before
and
remembered
many
friends
formerly
met
and
i
believed
they
would
remember
me
i
went
directly
to
the
house
of
tomas
triboso
in
whose
house
we
had
held
meeting
i
had
his
autograph
in
my
old
memorandum
book
on
showing
him
this
he
grasped
my
hand
and
called
his
wife
saying
here
is
our
old
friend
the
mormon
who
preached
in
our
house
ten
years
ago
the
old
lady
came
in
smiling
shook
hands
and
embraced
me
saying
that
all
the
women
in
town
remembered
my
preaching
a
good
dinner
was
ordered
at
once
don
tomas
asked
how
he
could
serve
me
i
explained
my
desire
to
reach
the
mormon
settlements
as
quick
as
possible
giving
him
my
reasons
he
replied
all
right
i
have
two
good
saddle
horses
i
would
like
to
have
you
stay
and
visit
us
all
the
people
would
be
delighted
to
see
and
hear
you
talk
we
often
speak
about
your
people
and
are
glad
to
hear
that
they
are
coming
into
mexico
we
hope
that
they
will
get
here
into
our
district
in
time
after
dinner
my
kind
host
saddled
up
and
took
me
to
providencia
there
introduced
me
to
the
manager
who
next
morning
sent
me
to
namaquipe
where
i
met
the
family
of
the
good
old
patriarch
francisco
vasques
formerly
spoken
of
in
this
way
i
was
forwarded
from
place
to
place
with
dispatch
making
through
in
good
time
with
little
expense
i
met
brother
snow
at
coralitos
and
showed
him
the
following
letter
snow
burton
preston
and
dear
sirs
at
the
request
of
jones
i
write
this
letter
i
have
bonded
the
ranch
w
for
the
period
of
sixty
days
for
in
good
and
lawful
money
of
the
united
states
i
have
agreed
with
jones
to
sell
the
same
to
his
people
if
he
can
take
up
the
bond
within
the
time
i
have
given
him
jones
and
i
have
been
traveling
together
looking
at
lands
jones
in
the
interest
of
his
people
and
i
for
myself
looking
for
grazing
jones
has
been
of
great
benefit
to
me
as
an
interpreter
and
is
well
posted
in
mexican
lands
and
i
do
this
in
appreciation
of
his
friendship
and
services
this
land
is
mostly
farming
with
plenty
of
good
timber
after
the
payment
of
the
property
can
be
delivered
to
purchasers
this
property
can
not
be
held
long
without
much
expense
which
i
can
not
conveniently
do
at
present
besides
delays
are
dangerous
i
have
given
jones
my
price
on
the
land
which
contains
acres
all
told
this
is
good
country
which
jones
is
thoroughly
competent
to
detail
to
you
hoping
to
hear
from
some
of
you
gentlemen
soon
i
am
very
respectfully
yours
south
temosachic
mexico
may
this
was
written
on
the
back
of
the
letter
i
have
considered
the
foregoing
and
can
say
that
while
i
regard
the
tract
favorably
located
along
the
sierra
madre
some
eighty
to
one
hundred
miles
south
of
corralis
basin
and
according
to
representation
is
a
desirable
place
i
am
not
in
any
condition
at
present
to
entertain
the
proposition
but
hope
in
the
future
to
see
our
people
stretching
out
in
that
direction
e
snow
brother
snow
said
in
substance
that
the
money
that
had
been
appropriated
for
the
purchase
of
lands
in
mexico
was
about
all
exhausted
and
no
very
good
results
obtained
that
there
had
been
so
much
time
and
means
wasted
that
he
doubted
if
the
authorities
would
pay
any
more
attention
to
land
purchases
in
mexico
and
if
anything
more
was
done
that
he
believed
it
would
be
through
private
enterprise
also
said
that
if
he
had
the
money
he
would
help
me
out
in
the
matter
but
hoped
that
i
could
go
and
enlist
help
from
some
of
the
brethren
who
were
able
to
buy
on
their
own
responsibility
on
receiving
this
word
i
started
immediately
for
utah
came
direct
to
salt
lake
city
and
offered
this
land
the
first
answer
i
received
was
that
my
land
was
too
dear
that
i
should
not
expect
such
a
price
when
good
lands
could
be
obtained
for
this
amount
i
was
surprised
at
this
ignorance
of
land
matters
in
mexico
for
i
knew
all
the
lands
offered
for
such
low
figures
were
almost
worthless
and
i
supposed
this
was
now
understood
the
land
i
was
offering
would
have
been
cheap
at
ten
times
the
price
in
comparison
to
any
yet
procured
even
as
a
gift
poor
land
means
poor
people
and
expensive
water
added
to
cheap
land
means
dear
homes
i
have
often
been
puzzled
to
see
how
eager
some
people
are
to
purchase
acreage
because
the
land
was
cheap
when
the
preparing
of
this
land
for
homes
would
cost
much
more
than
good
lands
that
could
be
obtained
where
homes
could
be
made
easily
and
cheaply
and
much
better
when
made
i
worked
hard
to
get
this
land
secured
finally
i
met
with
a
party
at
ogden
who
agreed
to
meet
me
in
chihuahua
within
the
time
and
if
the
land
was
as
represented
secure
it
a
day
was
set
to
meet
i
hurried
back
to
chihuahua
and
got
an
outfit
all
ready
for
the
trip
feeling
safe
for
i
knew
that
the
land
would
show
for
itself
this
party
never
came
i
received
a
letter
giving
some
excuse
but
saying
they
would
come
in
a
few
days
before
the
time
proposed
the
bond
was
up
and
the
persons
wanting
the
chance
bought
the
land
the
day
it
was
on
the
market
i
then
telegraphed
to
the
parties
that
they
need
not
come
as
it
was
too
late
chapter
liii
other
brethren
visit
my
proposed
purchase
their
good
report
death
of
my
son
wiley
my
return
to
salt
lake
city
a
new
invention
i
now
made
up
my
mind
to
get
the
best
understanding
of
various
tracts
of
lands
then
for
sale
i
succeeded
to
my
satisfaction
i
wished
before
leaving
mexico
to
get
some
of
our
people
to
go
with
me
and
see
the
tract
of
land
that
i
had
been
recommending
for
many
persons
supposed
that
i
had
exaggerated
its
merits
i
again
visited
brother
snow
headquarters
hoping
that
i
could
get
someone
sent
to
see
this
land
i
knew
the
parties
who
had
purchased
it
and
had
reason
to
believe
that
it
could
be
bought
of
them
still
at
a
reasonable
figure
considering
its
qualities
i
succeeded
in
getting
the
brethren
interested
enough
to
let
two
of
the
elders
brother
spencer
and
bishop
williams
two
of
the
most
reliable
pioneers
in
camp
to
go
with
me
we
were
gone
fourteen
days
on
their
return
they
reported
that
i
had
shown
to
them
the
best
country
they
had
ever
seen
illinois
and
kentucky
not
excepted
also
the
most
hospitable
and
welldisposed
people
they
had
ever
met
i
now
felt
satisfied
as
far
as
duty
was
concerned
this
land
was
acknowledged
to
be
much
better
than
i
reported
it
to
be
i
now
left
mexico
with
the
feeling
that
i
had
done
all
i
could
at
that
time
i
came
to
salt
lake
again
and
offered
some
other
good
lands
that
i
had
listed
for
sale
but
all
faith
in
mexican
land
matters
seemed
at
an
end
a
great
many
persons
having
visited
and
seen
the
country
purchased
left
in
disgust
supposing
there
was
none
better
the
only
way
to
account
for
this
good
land
being
passed
by
is
simply
to
use
the
old
hackneyed
expression
wait
the
time
has
come
yet
after
stopping
in
salt
lake
city
for
a
short
time
i
started
for
home
in
arizona
on
my
way
home
i
called
upon
the
gentleman
who
had
bought
the
land
he
knew
all
about
my
efforts
to
secure
the
property
and
pledged
himself
to
me
that
i
should
have
the
handling
of
the
property
should
it
ever
be
wanted
when
i
arrived
at
home
i
found
my
son
wiley
very
sick
from
and
exposure
he
had
become
consumptive
i
was
advised
to
move
him
to
a
cooler
climate
we
fitted
up
to
go
his
desire
was
to
move
to
mexico
i
felt
like
doing
anything
to
please
him
for
he
was
good
and
faithful
to
me
and
in
every
respect
a
true
man
he
had
been
with
me
on
some
of
my
hardest
missions
and
was
always
faithful
he
tried
hard
to
get
me
to
load
him
into
a
wagon
and
start
but
i
could
see
that
he
was
fast
failing
after
being
confined
but
a
few
days
to
the
house
he
gave
up
saying
well
pa
i
ca
pull
through
i
will
have
to
give
it
up
what
shall
i
tell
ma
i
never
saw
a
more
death
than
his
was
this
was
a
hard
loss
to
me
for
he
was
like
a
father
to
the
children
in
my
absence
another
son
years
of
age
was
now
taken
quite
sick
seemingly
almost
the
same
we
were
about
fitted
up
for
a
move
i
now
determined
to
start
for
utah
death
seemed
to
desire
the
lives
of
my
family
others
were
complaining
my
sick
son
seemed
uneasy
and
wanted
to
move
so
we
started
out
after
being
on
the
road
but
three
days
he
died
and
was
buried
at
the
vulture
mining
camp
my
three
oldest
sons
remained
in
arizona
and
are
there
yet
i
would
often
find
myself
counting
over
my
children
to
see
how
many
i
had
left
sometimes
i
felt
almost
bewildered
after
leaving
vulture
five
children
two
grand
children
and
myself
traveled
through
alone
coming
by
the
way
of
scanlan
ferry
we
had
no
further
trouble
after
this
death
seemed
satisfied
for
the
time
being
we
met
travelers
at
different
times
along
the
road
sometimes
a
single
wagon
never
more
than
two
or
three
as
grass
and
water
are
scarce
in
many
places
large
companies
can
not
travel
as
well
as
small
parties
the
country
is
now
safe
to
travel
on
any
of
the
routes
through
to
mexico
ranches
and
settlements
wherever
it
is
possible
to
locate
for
water
we
arrived
in
fairview
sanpete
county
where
my
daughter
mary
lived
we
bought
a
home
for
the
family
my
daughter
ella
having
lost
her
husband
took
charge
of
the
children
when
i
came
to
salt
lake
city
to
start
business
at
my
old
trade
this
i
found
would
be
difficult
to
do
as
the
trade
had
somewhat
changed
and
it
would
take
time
and
capital
to
get
a
start
so
i
concluded
to
start
on
a
project
i
had
had
in
my
mind
for
a
number
of
years
that
was
to
invent
a
better
than
any
yet
in
use
and
make
the
same
adjustable
to
riders
this
i
have
finally
accomplished
after
hard
work
and
much
more
delay
than
i
expected
when
i
commenced
i
will
now
give
what
i
have
formerly
promised
a
short
account
of
something
i
have
learned
about
some
of
the
indian
tribes
i
have
visited
chapter
liv
the
apache
indians
ideas
concerning
god
a
statement
concerning
the
jesuits
treachery
of
kerker
slaughter
of
the
apaches
the
navajoes
colonel
chavez
horse
race
loss
of
government
horses
war
with
this
tribe
the
yaqui
tribe
the
tarumaries
a
peculiar
custom
this
chapter
will
be
devoted
to
what
i
have
seen
and
learned
about
apaches
and
other
southern
tribes
the
common
supposition
is
that
the
apaches
are
by
nature
and
desire
a
people
and
have
always
been
so
this
is
a
mistake
but
it
is
a
fact
that
we
have
to
go
back
almost
a
century
to
find
them
a
peaceable
people
their
own
story
is
that
they
were
once
vegetarians
they
were
so
opposed
to
killing
that
they
would
say
to
the
bear
god
made
you
go
in
peace
i
will
not
kill
you
and
to
the
birds
god
made
you
with
feathers
to
protect
you
in
cold
air
and
wings
to
fly
how
good
god
has
been
to
you
and
even
to
the
rattlesnake
they
would
say
you
have
rattles
and
tell
us
where
you
are
so
that
we
can
get
out
of
your
way
we
will
not
kill
you
i
am
giving
this
as
the
apaches
gave
it
to
me
they
believe
in
god
the
father
and
in
a
god
mother
and
that
god
dwells
in
a
place
where
he
can
see
and
understand
what
they
do
that
they
once
dwelt
with
him
and
that
when
they
die
if
they
have
done
good
they
will
go
back
to
dwell
with
their
father
and
mother
but
if
unworthy
they
are
sent
away
from
them
in
sorrow
they
pray
in
the
evening
that
they
may
be
protected
from
their
enemies
and
have
good
dreams
desiring
that
their
dead
friends
may
visit
and
talk
to
them
they
believe
that
they
once
had
more
power
with
god
than
they
now
have
and
acknowledged
that
they
had
done
wrong
in
killing
their
own
people
saying
that
for
that
reason
their
prayers
were
not
heard
and
answered
as
formerly
they
say
that
americans
do
not
honor
god
but
throw
his
name
at
their
mules
and
cattle
the
same
as
they
do
clods
or
rocks
and
that
it
is
their
duty
to
destroy
the
wicked
blasphemers
from
off
the
earth
that
none
have
a
right
to
live
unless
they
honor
their
name
they
reckon
that
by
killing
white
men
at
the
ratio
they
have
been
that
eventually
they
will
exterminate
the
white
race
this
was
their
belief
a
few
years
since
possibly
they
are
beginning
to
think
differently
by
this
time
they
say
that
the
cause
of
their
fighting
with
the
catholic
mexicans
is
that
when
mexico
was
conquered
by
the
priests
they
wanted
the
natives
of
mexico
to
cease
to
worship
the
real
father
god
and
worship
gods
made
of
wood
and
stone
most
of
the
natives
submitted
to
this
but
the
apaches
refused
and
went
into
the
mountains
away
from
the
priests
after
a
while
the
indians
that
commenced
to
worship
the
wood
and
stone
gods
made
war
on
them
by
order
of
the
priests
and
drove
them
to
bloodshed
after
a
while
they
agreed
to
submit
and
made
a
treaty
to
listen
to
the
priests
but
they
soon
found
they
were
bad
men
and
had
been
enemies
ever
since
now
for
a
little
history
partly
written
and
partly
traditionary
some
two
hundred
miles
in
a
westerly
direction
from
the
city
of
chihuahua
among
the
sierra
madre
mountains
there
is
a
beautiful
valley
of
about
fifty
thousand
acres
of
land
well
watered
and
surrounded
with
timbered
mountains
the
mexicans
call
this
paradise
or
garden
of
eden
about
eighty
years
ago
the
jesuits
planted
a
mission
among
the
apaches
in
this
beautiful
valley
everything
went
on
happily
for
a
season
the
head
priest
had
considerable
influence
with
the
natives
using
his
power
for
his
own
convenience
in
connection
with
many
other
selfish
customs
the
priests
required
of
the
indians
one
of
their
handsomest
daughters
to
live
at
the
mission
making
them
believe
that
there
was
some
religious
ceremony
essential
to
their
welfare
that
required
the
presence
of
this
maiden
a
daughter
of
the
chief
was
selected
the
priests
had
told
the
indians
that
they
lived
pure
lives
before
god
after
a
while
the
daughter
of
the
chief
was
missing
when
the
indians
made
inquiries
for
her
they
were
told
that
she
had
been
taken
to
heaven
in
a
miraculous
manner
and
was
made
a
saint
the
chief
did
not
believe
the
story
and
suspected
treachery
there
was
an
old
woman
who
had
had
charge
of
the
indian
girl
the
apaches
seized
and
tortured
her
until
she
confessed
the
truth
the
priest
had
lived
with
the
daughter
as
a
wife
and
when
her
condition
became
such
as
to
betray
him
he
had
her
killed
and
buried
the
indians
found
her
body
and
confirmed
this
treachery
they
then
raised
and
killed
all
connected
with
the
mission
and
destroyed
everything
possible
they
swore
vengeance
on
the
priests
and
their
followers
and
vowed
that
no
catholic
should
ever
inhabit
this
valley
i
have
seen
the
ruins
they
made
within
the
last
few
years
and
heard
this
story
from
the
mexicans
living
within
a
day
travel
from
this
valley
they
all
dread
the
apaches
to
this
day
no
mexican
has
ever
dared
to
make
a
home
there
from
that
time
until
the
present
the
apaches
have
been
at
war
with
the
mexicans
when
white
men
first
went
to
the
region
where
the
apaches
roam
the
indians
looked
upon
them
as
a
different
class
of
people
and
did
not
make
war
upon
the
few
white
traders
they
met
on
the
road
to
the
city
of
chihuahua
but
they
would
go
in
and
trade
with
merchant
trains
owned
by
americans
and
in
no
way
molest
them
this
peaceful
state
of
affairs
was
broken
up
in
the
year
at
that
time
the
state
of
chihuahua
was
having
a
hard
time
with
the
apaches
and
the
government
offered
a
large
reward
for
their
scalps
ranging
from
to
per
head
this
offer
got
to
the
ears
of
colonel
kerker
of
texas
he
raised
a
company
of
texans
and
went
to
the
city
of
chihuahua
and
contracted
with
the
governor
for
apache
scalps
the
colt
revolver
had
recently
been
brought
into
use
this
company
of
rangers
carried
these
weapons
concealed
under
their
coats
and
went
to
galliana
a
town
on
the
rio
santa
maria
in
the
part
of
chihuahua
near
the
mountains
where
the
indians
dwelt
this
kerker
arranged
to
have
the
apaches
come
to
a
feast
prepared
for
them
agreeing
to
meet
them
unarmed
as
friends
the
indians
believing
these
white
men
real
friends
came
in
without
suspicion
and
while
partaking
of
the
hospitality
the
rangers
commenced
with
their
revolvers
and
killed
over
a
hundred
of
them
the
indians
could
make
no
resistance
but
were
literally
slaughtered
kerker
got
his
money
but
lost
the
respect
of
all
decent
men
a
few
years
after
this
i
was
in
the
apache
country
they
were
killing
both
whites
and
mexicans
at
every
opportunity
years
after
i
was
again
in
that
country
and
it
was
still
the
same
for
many
years
when
a
white
man
was
killed
by
an
apache
the
whites
would
remark
there
is
another
of
kerker
victims
i
saw
this
same
individual
in
in
santa
fe
when
he
was
there
for
a
few
days
so
indignant
were
the
people
at
him
that
there
was
a
strong
talk
of
lynching
him
individually
i
succeeded
in
making
friends
with
most
of
these
apaches
i
have
talked
with
them
but
they
have
no
confidence
in
the
mexican
or
white
man
the
move
made
by
crook
that
at
the
time
proved
a
success
namely
getting
one
band
to
fight
another
finally
ceased
to
work
and
the
scouts
enlisted
for
the
last
few
years
have
done
but
little
killing
by
the
whites
these
apaches
are
considered
the
worst
indians
on
the
continent
i
have
never
heard
an
apology
or
excuse
for
their
conduct
by
any
one
so
like
the
old
miner
who
attended
a
methodist
revival
when
the
preacher
called
on
all
who
were
for
god
to
rise
to
their
feet
all
got
up
but
the
old
miner
when
all
for
the
devil
were
called
to
stand
up
the
old
miner
arose
the
parson
asked
him
why
he
voted
for
satan
the
reply
was
that
he
never
liked
to
see
any
man
without
a
friend
the
navajoes
a
short
sketch
of
this
tribe
may
be
interesting
they
inhabit
the
country
west
of
the
settled
portion
of
new
mexico
in
when
i
first
knew
them
they
were
great
thieves
but
not
much
given
to
killing
their
philosophy
was
to
spare
the
herders
so
that
they
could
raise
more
stock
they
were
great
sheep
thieves
often
taking
whole
herds
and
sometimes
taking
the
herders
along
the
mexicans
feared
to
follow
them
through
the
canyons
and
when
the
indians
once
reached
the
mountains
they
were
generally
let
alone
after
the
government
was
extended
and
new
mexico
became
a
territory
the
forces
commenced
to
try
to
stop
these
raids
and
after
many
years
partially
succeeded
and
troops
were
stationed
in
the
navajo
country
there
was
a
batallion
of
mexican
volunteers
cavalry
under
chavez
stationed
at
one
of
the
outposts
the
indians
were
seemingly
subdued
they
were
always
considered
smart
and
somewhat
politic
as
well
as
thrifty
and
industrious
so
they
soon
accepted
the
situation
when
they
found
the
government
was
determined
to
make
them
behave
they
made
a
treaty
and
agreed
to
quit
stealing
and
allow
these
troops
to
be
stationed
in
their
country
and
live
in
peace
this
colonel
chavez
was
a
great
gambler
and
horse
racer
the
navajoes
were
fond
of
racing
also
the
colonel
had
a
fine
horse
that
he
considered
a
world
beater
a
race
was
gotten
up
with
the
indians
who
were
willing
to
bet
anything
on
their
horse
so
sure
was
colonel
chavez
of
winning
that
he
bet
some
five
hundred
head
of
government
horses
against
the
same
number
of
indian
ponies
the
indians
looked
upon
the
colonel
as
owner
of
these
horses
when
the
race
came
off
the
indians
won
the
colonel
was
in
a
scrape
he
refused
to
give
up
the
horses
so
the
indians
took
them
i
do
remember
whether
a
fight
ensued
immediately
or
not
but
i
believe
there
did
at
any
rate
the
report
was
circulated
that
the
indians
had
declared
war
and
had
run
off
all
the
soldier
horses
a
war
of
extermination
was
declared
against
these
indians
and
troops
were
sent
into
their
country
their
ranches
farms
and
stock
were
destroyed
and
many
of
them
were
killed
the
remainder
were
stripped
of
everything
they
were
taken
prisoners
and
put
upon
a
reservation
in
the
eastern
portion
of
new
mexico
here
they
remained
in
poverty
for
some
years
i
do
not
know
whether
the
facts
were
ever
known
by
the
government
or
not
but
i
beleive
they
were
after
a
time
the
indians
were
allowed
to
go
back
to
their
old
country
a
reservation
set
apart
for
them
and
some
stock
was
given
them
to
make
a
start
being
industrious
and
thrifty
they
soon
began
to
pick
up
they
made
blankets
and
traded
them
for
ponies
many
of
them
about
the
years
came
into
the
mormon
settlements
some
few
carrying
enough
blankets
on
their
backs
to
buy
a
mare
pony
an
indian
that
could
load
a
little
mexican
donkey
with
blankets
was
considered
a
good
trader
it
was
not
many
years
until
these
navajoes
had
large
bands
of
horses
and
sheep
they
are
again
quite
rich
and
prosperous
yaquis
a
few
words
about
the
yaquis
might
be
interesting
also
they
inhabit
the
rio
yaqui
in
sonoro
they
are
an
agricultural
people
and
were
occupying
this
same
country
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
and
were
peaceable
and
quite
numerous
after
the
government
under
spain
was
well
established
they
offered
to
make
a
grant
of
the
yaqui
country
to
the
inhabitants
the
indians
declined
the
offer
saying
the
country
was
and
always
had
been
theirs
and
that
they
did
not
ask
it
to
be
granted
to
them
this
was
rather
an
insult
to
the
arrogant
spaniard
the
offer
has
been
repeated
from
time
to
time
but
the
indians
have
always
declined
the
grant
on
the
same
old
grounds
so
the
yaqui
country
stands
on
the
maps
of
mexico
as
government
lands
efforts
have
been
made
several
times
to
oust
these
indians
from
their
lands
grants
have
been
given
from
time
to
time
as
was
the
brannan
grant
but
the
indians
have
never
given
up
their
idea
of
prior
rights
there
are
a
great
many
of
the
best
citizens
of
mexico
in
sympathy
with
the
yaquis
tarumaries
this
tribe
inhabits
the
mountain
country
in
the
western
part
of
the
state
of
chihuahua
there
are
many
villages
situated
in
the
sierra
madre
mountains
accessible
only
by
very
difficult
at
the
time
of
the
conquest
these
people
occupied
not
only
these
mountain
villages
but
many
of
the
fertile
valleys
along
the
foothills
many
of
the
present
towns
of
western
chihuahua
bear
the
old
indian
names
and
are
inhabited
by
people
descended
from
the
ancient
inhabitants
with
a
little
foreign
mixture
the
pure
bloods
greatly
predominate
in
many
of
these
towns
there
are
bands
of
these
people
who
keep
up
their
old
customs
name
and
language
but
are
recognized
as
citizens
they
submitted
to
catholicism
in
form
but
of
late
years
have
almost
entirely
lost
respect
for
the
saying
that
they
cared
more
for
their
coppers
than
they
did
for
their
souls
these
people
both
natives
and
mixed
are
very
hospitable
and
industrious
and
are
more
honest
and
virtuous
than
are
the
average
mexican
the
villagers
of
the
mountains
are
peculiar
they
seem
to
have
a
dread
of
mixing
or
associating
much
with
anyone
even
the
mexicans
whose
neighbors
they
are
it
is
their
habit
when
anyone
approaches
their
village
for
all
the
inhabitants
to
leave
their
houses
and
retire
a
short
ways
leaving
their
doors
open
and
everything
exposed
so
that
if
anything
is
wanted
by
the
travelers
they
can
help
themselves
but
one
thing
must
always
be
done
the
pay
for
the
article
taken
must
be
left
in
sight
or
without
grace
the
party
taking
ever
so
small
an
article
without
pay
will
be
waylaid
and
will
be
very
lucky
if
he
escapes
with
his
life
so
positive
are
these
rules
that
no
one
dare
take
the
risk
and
the
people
have
commanded
the
utmost
respect
for
ages
by
all
who
pass
through
their
country
unless
imposed
upon
and
insulted
they
molest
no
one
these
mountain
indians
are
excellent
hunters
deer
turkey
and
bear
are
plentiful
in
the
mountains
they
often
go
into
the
city
of
chihuahua
to
trade
they
pack
most
of
their
trade
on
their
backs
traveling
in
single
file
paying
no
attention
to
anyone
except
to
do
their
trading
and
go
straight
back
home
some
years
since
at
the
town
of
santa
rosa
these
indians
while
on
a
trading
trip
were
insulted
and
abused
by
the
inhabitants
the
indians
went
home
gathered
some
four
hundred
armed
men
marched
back
through
a
number
of
settlements
attacked
the
place
and
almost
exterminated
the
people
then
went
home
satisfied
they
were
never
called
to
account
for
the
act
an
account
of
the
affair
has
been
given
to
me
several
times
by
different
mexicans
who
invariably
tell
it
in
honor
of
the

february
i
herewith
send
you
an
account
of
the
country
and
people
of
this
region
description
of
el
paso
the
town
of
el
paso
is
situated
on
the
right
bank
of
the
rio
grande
del
norte
in
the
state
of
chihuahua
on
a
low
bottom
liable
to
much
damage
from
high
water
land
sandy
the
streets
are
simply
old
cattle
tracks
running
in
every
direction
if
an
idea
can
be
given
of
them
without
mapping
it
will
be
by
saying
they
followed
the
forks
of
the
trails
giving
the
grounds
somewhat
the
appearance
or
shape
of
irregular
triangles
the
being
it
costs
a
great
deal
to
keep
a
in
order
the
houses
are
one
story
made
of
adobe
solid
block
mainly
after
the
old
moorish
style
of
small
fortresses
hollow
square
in
center
one
door
in
front
climate
and
products
the
climate
is
warm
and
pleasant
plowing
and
sowing
can
be
done
any
time
during
the
winter
this
makes
the
farmer
rather
indolent
as
he
does
not
have
to
hurry
as
ours
of
the
colder
climates
do
the
products
are
wheat
corn
barley
beans
peas
onions
pepper
sweet
potatoes
and
some
few
other
vegetables
many
things
more
might
be
profitably
cultivated
if
once
understood
but
the
people
are
satisfied
with
what
they
have
and
manifest
but
little
interest
in
new
introductions
the
fruits
are
grapes
in
great
abundance
and
of
the
best
quality
pears
which
the
people
dry
in
great
abundance
price
ten
cents
per
pound
they
are
excellent
eating
their
apples
are
small
seedlings
not
worth
eating
a
few
peaches
of
an
excellent
kind
do
well
here
i
have
seen
no
other
fruits
i
have
heard
that
strawberries
and
some
other
small
fruits
have
been
cultivated
by
foreigners
and
they
do
extremely
well
rude
agriculture
the
mode
of
cultivation
is
with
an
old
wooden
plow
working
their
cattle
by
the
horns
they
scratch
up
the
ground
very
poorly
afterwards
doing
much
work
with
the
hoe
they
regulate
their
ground
for
watering
by
making
small
embankments
around
small
irregular
plats
from
thirty
to
fifty
feet
across
and
flooding
the
land
i
think
this
a
poor
way
as
it
causes
their
land
to
bake
very
hard
but
this
is
the
manner
in
which
their
fathers
did
it
so
they
think
it
is
all
right
they
cultivate
all
open
crops
with
the
hoe
using
the
large
hoe
they
cut
their
hay
with
the
same
tool
in
arizona
we
saw
hundreds
of
tons
at
the
government
posts
cut
in
this
same
way
they
harvest
with
reap
hooks
and
thresh
with
goats
or
flails
mechanics
doctors
and
lawyers
mechanics
are
scarce
in
this
town
of
ten
thousand
inhabitants
there
is
one
blacksmith
shop
three
or
four
carpenter
shops
two
tailors
three
or
four
shoe
shops
one
and
one
silversmith
and
this
is
as
far
as
i
have
been
able
to
learn
about
the
whole
number
to
compensate
for
this
lack
of
mechanics
there
is
but
one
doctor
and
one
lawyer
and
the
latter
is
supposed
to
be
as
he
has
quit
the
practice
walks
quietly
around
the
town
says
but
little
to
anyone
is
polite
dresses
neatly
and
seems
to
mind
his
own
business
my
opinion
is
that
he
is
the
most
sensible
lawyer
i
have
ever
seen
limited
commerce
the
commerce
of
the
country
is
limited
the
people
sell
their
wines
and
dried
fruits
generally
as
soon
as
ready
they
go
to
all
the
surrounding
country
to
chihuahua
as
well
as
up
the
country
to
santa
fe
and
arizona
there
are
three
jew
stores
and
one
mexican
store
their
business
is
small
there
are
many
small
dealers
of
various
kinds
and
there
are
many
people
who
seem
to
live
on
occasional
small
amounts
but
how
they
get
their
money
deponent
saith
not
the
people
are
slow
to
adopt
improvements
things
look
about
the
same
as
they
did
when
i
was
here
about
thirty
years
ago
in
the
town
looks
about
the
same
a
very
little
has
been
done
about
the
square
and
church
hardly
perceivable
they
use
carts
and
everything
seems
as
though
it
was
but
a
short
time
since
i
was
here
and
saw
things
just
as
they
now
are
hospitality
this
is
natural
to
the
people
of
this
country
a
people
naturally
i
do
not
believe
can
be
found
they
are
polite
and
mannerly
even
the
lowest
of
them
their
children
are
quiet
and
obedient
there
being
no
here
parents
are
affectionate
to
their
children
husbands
are
polite
and
affectionate
they
have
great
reverence
for
deity
their
religion
and
old
age
get
them
once
directed
right
and
they
will
be
the
best
people
on
earth
health
and
morals
the
people
are
generally
healthy
there
being
but
little
disease
among
them
there
are
a
few
americans
living
here
as
to
their
morals
i
believe
the
people
of
this
town
stand
above
par
compared
with
more
civilized
communities
the
apaches
are
the
only
people
said
to
be
strictly
virtuous
that
i
have
met
on
this
journey
as
yet
though
it
is
generally
admitted
that
the
aborigines
are
much
more
virtuous
than
the
mixed
race
of
this
country
here
the
people
are
a
mixture
of
the
spanish
and
native
the
native
blood
predominating
of
the
pure
bloods
there
are
only
about
two
hundred
remaining
in
this
town
catholicism
prevails
more
here
than
in
the
interior
so
i
am
informed
by
persons
from
the
lower
states
of
mexico
there
liberty
of
conscience
is
beginning
to
be
more
popular
and
priestcraft
is
beginning
to
lose
its
power
over
many
but
not
enough
for
them
to
be
popular
as
yet
stock
the
stock
of
the
country
is
scarce
and
inferior
horses
cattle
and
goats
are
tolerably
plentiful
there
are
a
few
pigs
and
fowls
the
circulating
medium
is
corn
copper
coin
greenbacks
and
a
little
silver
dogs
are
in
great
abundance
noisy
but
seldom
bite
local
government
taxes
are
light
except
on
work
on
dam
and
the
municipal
regulations
seem
good
they
have
a
police
force
but
it
is
seldom
needed
the
officer
the
jefe
politico
seems
to
control
there
are
some
more
officers
such
as
police
magistrates
etc
but
the
first
seems
to
be
manager
of
everything
of
a
political
nature
the
present
incumbent
pablo
padio
is
serving
his
second
term
having
been
lately
he
is
very
much
of
a
gentleman
the
people
are
very
obedient
to
official
authority
and
show
great
respect
to
the
same
various
with
all
the
faults
of
the
people
which
faults
are
more
blamable
to
the
manner
in
which
they
have
been
ruled
than
to
the
people
there
are
good
and
noble
principles
among
them
their
devotion
to
their
religion
i
consider
a
virtue
for
they
have
had
no
chance
to
have
any
better
their
reverence
is
unbounded
and
as
i
before
stated
let
them
once
be
enlightened
with
the
gospel
and
i
believe
they
will
receive
the
truth
and
they
will
not
fall
away
but
will
stick
to
the
right
jones
mexico
although
a
sister
republic
with
railroad
communications
and
much
commercial
intercourse
with
the
united
states
is
not
well
understood
by
the
average
american
there
has
been
for
a
long
time
and
still
is
to
quite
an
extent
a
prejudice
against
the
mexican
people
by
the
americans
we
look
upon
them
as
far
behind
the
people
of
the
united
states
and
often
make
unfair
remarks
about
the
stupid
mexicans
not
stopping
to
consider
who
the
people
are
or
what
their
opportunities
have
been
a
great
many
accuse
the
roman
catholic
church
of
being
responsible
for
the
ignorance
and
degradation
of
the
inhabitants
in
as
few
words
as
possible
i
will
offer
an
apology
for
the
mexican
nation
and
compare
what
we
have
done
with
the
same
element
when
this
continent
was
first
discovered
there
were
millions
of
indians
inhabiting
it
extending
from
the
atlantic
to
the
pacific
and
from
the
north
sea
to
the
gulf
of
mexico
that
portion
of
the
continent
lying
west
on
a
line
from
texas
to
oregon
fell
under
the
control
of
spain
a
catholic
government
that
east
under
protestant
christianity
up
to
the
treaty
with
mexico
nearly
of
this
continent
was
under
spanish
rule
let
us
see
what
the
conditions
of
the
country
were
at
that
time
there
were
about
six
millions
of
the
inhabitants
of
mexico
enjoying
all
the
rights
of
citizenship
a
great
portion
of
the
rulers
of
the
country
being
of
the
natives
no
distinction
was
made
but
the
priests
offered
to
the
natives
the
inducement
of
equal
rights
with
the
invaders
mexico
is
simply
a
nation
of
converted
aborigines
living
and
having
a
being
and
still
numbering
as
many
as
at
first
the
power
and
influence
of
the
priests
were
extended
into
arizona
new
mexico
and
california
and
thousands
of
indians
were
brought
into
peaceable
relations
no
wars
of
extermination
were
declared
against
the
natives
but
missions
of
peace
were
the
main
means
of
conquest
up
to
the
year
there
were
in
this
mexican
territory
tens
of
thousands
living
and
at
least
enjoying
an
existence
now
let
us
see
what
has
been
done
by
protestant
christianity
for
the
natives
who
dwelt
on
their
side
of
the
line
i
do
not
propose
to
quote
hundreds
of
pages
of
history
to
show
but
will
simply
refer
to
the
fact
they
have
been
killed
off
just
as
have
been
the
bear
the
wolf
and
the
wild
animals
detrimental
to
the
interests
of
the
good
pious
puritans
who
wanted
the
country
the
real
and
true
comparison
is
how
do
the
natives
of
mexico
compare
with
those
of
the
united
states
let
that
power
and
influence
which
took
hold
of
the
natives
of
mexico
speak
and
say
to
those
who
took
hold
of
the
other
side
here
is
our
work
mexico
as
it
is
today
is
peopled
mainly
by
descendants
of
the
races
we
found
here
now
show
us
your
work
the
question
is
which
are
the
greater
people
americans
or
mexicans
the
question
should
be
which
are
the
greatest
the
mexican
or
american
indians
if
mexico
continues
to
improve
and
the
people
to
advance
in
the
future
as
they
have
for
a
few
years
past
the
question
may
yet
become
which
people
are
the
most
advanced
the
mexicans
have
many
national
characteristics
that
might
be
copied
to
advantage
by
americans
whether
national
contact
will
destroy
some
of
these
nobler
qualities
or
not
is
a
question
they
are
hospitable
polite
faithful
to
a
trust
true
to
their
friends
respectful
to
their
superiors
and
parents
when
they
have
the
means
they
are
ambitious
to
make
home
and
everything
around
pleasant
and
of
late
years
are
ambitious
to
advance
and
educate
the
people
they
are
tolerant
to
all
religious
denominations
many
suppose
that
priests
still
reign
in
mexico
the
catholic
priest
who
has
helped
to
preserve
the
life
of
a
nation
has
no
more
privileges
in
mexico
today
than
the
protestant
minister
who
has
helped
to
exterminate
the
natives
on
his
domain
in
many
respects
mexico
is
far
behind
other
civilized
countries
their
system
of
giving
out
their
lands
in
large
grants
has
left
the
country
in
many
places
comparatively
unsettled
it
is
no
uncommon
thing
for
one
man
to
own
from
a
hundred
thousand
to
a
million
acres
of
land
in
fact
on
the
very
start
all
valuable
lands
not
given
as
municipal
grants
were
given
to
individual
favorites
so
there
is
no
such
conditions
as
in
our
country
where
a
poor
man
can
go
and
locate
a
homestead
many
persons
have
been
deceived
by
the
offers
of
government
lands
in
mexico
supposing
they
could
get
good
lands
at
a
nominal
sum
the
only
way
to
get
good
lands
is
to
purchase
from
the
owners
of
undisputed
tracts
to
do
this
safely
the
buyer
or
agent
must
be
perfectly
familiar
with
the
language
also
the
customs
and
character
of
the
people
he
is
dealing
with
there
are
sharpers
speculators
and
deceivers
in
that
country
as
well
as
in
ours
many
of
the
officers
of
the
government
are
interested
in
speculations
in
lands
and
will
vouch
for
persons
when
their
recommend
is
interested
in
getting
titles
they
must
be
thoroughly
and
correctly
traced
back
to
the
original
grant
and
all
adverse
claims
settled
from
what
i
know
of
land
troubles
in
mexico
i
would
not
spend
much
money
on
any
land
that
had
ever
been
in
dispute
there
are
so
many
chances
for
deception
that
it
is
risky
there
are
many
tracts
of
land
where
the
titles
run
smoothly
back
to
the
origin
where
there
never
has
been
dispute
or
litigation
these
are
the
lands
to
look
for
if
one
wishes
to
live
in
peace
and
security
when
the
grants
were
first
allowed
many
times
the
boundaries
were
indefinite
the
boundaries
having
been
defined
by
mountains
or
streams
or
something
subject
to
dispute
the
country
not
being
fully
explored
those
taking
possession
would
set
their
monuments
so
as
to
take
in
all
the
country
that
would
be
considered
valuable
without
particularly
consulting
the
exact
lines
of
the
recorded
grant
after
ages
of
occupation
these
monuments
come
to
be
considered
proper
sometimes
they
were
short
sometimes
extended
beyond
the
lawful
lines
there
was
often
a
great
deal
of
waste
land
adjoining
these
grants
as
mexico
is
a
dry
country
no
lands
are
of
value
except
where
water
can
be
procured
as
the
country
began
to
be
prospected
by
foreigners
desirous
of
stock
ranches
and
also
the
more
advanced
condition
of
the
government
it
became
apparent
that
these
grants
should
be
more
perfectly
defined
so
that
what
land
still
remained
to
the
government
could
be
sold
as
these
old
grants
stood
there
was
no
certainty
even
to
a
government
title
as
the
grant
could
not
be
broken
or
infringed
upon
the
attempt
to
get
these
government
lands
and
the
failure
to
get
titles
has
given
rise
to
the
idea
that
there
are
no
good
titles
in
mexico
whereas
the
titles
of
these
grants
are
so
good
that
they
can
not
be
broken
and
when
there
is
any
controversy
between
the
government
and
land
grants
the
grants
almost
invariably
win
under
the
conditions
it
became
necessary
to
cause
a
of
the
whole
country
to
bring
this
about
the
country
was
cut
up
into
districts
and
contracts
let
to
persons
to
do
the
surveying
their
compensation
to
be
in
part
or
whole
or
percentage
of
the
lands
left
after
the
titled
grants
were
defined
it
now
became
a
question
between
the
old
land
owners
and
the
surveyors
which
would
get
the
most
land
where
the
surveyors
could
crowd
in
the
lines
they
had
the
more
land
while
the
grants
sought
at
times
to
extend
or
reach
the
first
allowance
this
has
given
rise
to
much
litigation
and
even
up
to
the
present
some
few
controversies
are
still
going
on
there
is
not
much
risk
in
buying
old
original
grants
that
run
regularly
without
adverse
claimants
in
some
few
places
there
were
small
plats
of
good
land
secured
to
these
surveyors
by
cutting
off
from
the
old
grants
this
being
adjoining
to
the
waste
land
would
be
used
as
a
bait
to
sell
their
worthless
lands
this
surveying
business
was
conducted
by
corporations
composed
of
the
most
wealthy
and
influential
men
of
the
several
districts
as
the
lands
and
lines
became
defined
they
having
the
option
from
the
government
on
all
the
land
took
possession
of
these
new
portions
and
commenced
to
advertise
and
offer
millions
of
acres
for
sale
at
very
low
figures
sometimes
this
surveying
company
would
become
owners
of
certain
ranches
many
of
the
incorporators
being
land
owners
would
arrange
with
the
surveying
company
to
add
acreage
from
the
worthless
lands
and
on
the
reputation
of
the
old
ranch
sell
the
whole
tract
to
explain
this
i
will
instance
one
case
that
came
under
my
own
observation
and
was
offered
here
in
utah
without
naming
the
ranch
i
will
call
it
c
what
is
commonly
known
as
the
rancho
de
c
when
enquiry
is
made
regarding
it
the
common
answer
from
the
people
is
that
c
is
a
fine
place
good
land
with
plenty
of
water
a
splendid
place
this
means
five
thousand
acres
of
good
bottom
land
along
the
rio
c
and
that
is
all
the
mexican
ranchers
mean
when
he
speaks
of
the
ranch
the
old
grant
probably
embraces
two
hundred
thousand
acres
extending
out
from
the
water
about
as
far
as
stock
would
travel
from
water
there
is
but
very
little
water
except
in
the
river
this
ranch
is
bounded
on
three
sides
by
dry
deserts
and
one
side
by
mountains
with
some
timber
one
attempt
has
been
made
to
put
this
ranch
with
five
hundred
thousand
acres
of
worthless
land
added
upon
the
market
on
the
reputation
of
the
little
fertile
valley
of
five
thousand
acres
of
fine
agricultural
lands
these
schemes
are
still
gotten
up
from
time
to
time
and
the
ignorant
are
imposed
upon
in
mexico
just
the
same
as
in
any
other
country
but
when
men
get
bitten
in
mexico
they
try
to
excuse
themselves
by
reporting
that
there
is
no
safety
in
titles
now
all
the
answer
that
can
be
made
to
this
is
do
business
in
mexico
just
the
same
as
you
would
in
any
other
country
that
is
determine
what
you
want
and
then
apply
where
it
is
to
be
had
find
good
land
with
good
titles
then
secure
it
by
purchasing
from
the
owner
there
are
as
good
titles
arid
protection
in
mexico
as
in
any
country
on
earth
and
men
who
have
lived
there
for
half
a
century
will
verify
this
the
climate
of
mexico
varies
from
very
warm
to
temperate
all
along
the
rio
del
norte
and
for
some
distance
out
the
climate
is
warm
there
is
a
mountain
range
running
clear
through
from
the
north
almost
to
the
south
coast
much
of
the
lands
cultivated
are
high
above
the
sea
level
they
are
from
four
to
seven
thousand
feet
the
mountain
valleys
and
table
lands
are
temperate
all
who
have
visited
the
republic
of
mexico
agree
that
the
climate
is
among
the
best
on
earth
many
persons
are
incredulous
when
told
that
mexico
is
not
a
hot
country
referring
to
other
countries
not
so
far
south
being
intensely
hot
many
think
the
further
south
we
go
the
hotter
it
becomes
the
temperature
depends
upon
the
altitude
and
as
stated
before
a
great
part
of
the
habitable
portion
of
mexico
being
high
the
climate
is
simply
delightful
thousands
of
people
live
and
cultivate
successfully
many
of
the
higher
valleys
without
irrigation
still
it
is
safe
to
have
flowing
water
so
that
it
can
be
used
for
irrigation
when
wanted
there
are
conflicting
reports
about
mexico
and
her
people
the
same
as
there
are
about
utah
how
often
are
we
of
utah
annoyed
by
the
scribbling
of
some
wiseacre
who
has
spent
a
whole
day
in
salt
lake
city
rode
around
and
been
stuffed
by
a
liberal
hack
driver
obtaining
all
the
information
needed
being
thoroughly
posted
he
writes
up
the
country
people
customs
facilities
and
explains
what
is
needed
and
advises
legislation
with
all
the
assurance
of
one
thoroughly
posted
some
of
our
elders
who
have
made
a
flying
visit
to
mexico
appear
to
me
about
as
presumptuous
what
they
do
see
or
know
would
make
a
book
what
they
do
see
is
often
through
a
glass
dimly
if
one
fast
traveler
of
note
happens
to
make
a
mistake
in
describing
something
all
the
rest
copy
like
some
smart
idiot
wrote
years
ago
that
the
flowers
of
mexico
had
no
perfume
the
birds
no
song
this
has
often
been
copied
when
there
is
not
a
word
of
truth
in
the
statement
neither
is
it
true
that
the
thorns
of
the
giant
cactus
sahuara
are
crooked
like
a
fish
hook
i
simply
mention
these
things
to
show
that
these
hasty
scribblers
are
not
reliable
on
things
of
more
importance
a
person
to
know
and
understand
mexico
and
her
people
as
the
saints
should
know
and
understand
them
will
have
to
go
into
the
interior
away
from
the
commercial
towns
and
cities
there
are
large
districts
of
country
inhabited
by
an
almost
pure
race
descendants
of
lehi
any
one
conversant
with
the
book
of
mormon
will
have
no
trouble
in
finding
abundant
proof
that
the
greater
portion
of
the
inhabitants
of
mexico
are
descendants
of
the
jews
and
are
the
very
people
or
a
great
portion
of
them
to
which
the
gospel
is
to
go
to
immediately
from
the
gentile
that
the
work
in
mexico
seems
a
little
slow
is
a
fact
but
no
fault
can
be
laid
to
the
natives
according
to
my
observation
and
experience
in
that
country
when
those
whose
duty
it
is
to
teach
them
are
ready
according
to
the
revelations
given
the
natives
will
receive
them
gladly
now
as
this
country
utah
is
fast
filling
up
with
inhabitants
that
have
and
are
coming
to
stay
there
naturally
will
be
an
element
that
will
push
on
from
time
to
time
go
west
young
man
is
now
obsolete
there
is
no
west
to
go
to
so
the
pioneer
must
either
turn
to
the
northern
plains
of
canada
or
the
mountain
valleys
of
mexico
or
allow
the
heel
of
civilization
to
be
placed
upon
his
neck
for
all
time
the
questions
arise
are
there
no
more
pioneers
have
they
ceased
to
be
have
we
all
found
the
haven
of
rest
so
long
looked
for
are
the
waste
places
all
built
up
i
can
not
think
that
all
progress
is
at
an
end
notwithstanding
salt
lake
city
is
a
great
place
still
i
do
not
believe
all
will
end
here
so
in
case
there
should
be
an
individual
or
two
who
have
the
spirit
of
pioneering
yet
lingering
within
them
i
will
ask
and
answer
a
few
questions
for
their
benefit
in
answering
these
questions
i
may
repeat
some
things
already
explained
in
the
book
but
for
the
convenience
of
many
persons
i
have
concluded
to
ask
and
answer
just
such
questions
as
are
put
to
me
almost
daily
doubtless
many
times
by
people
who
wish
to
gain
information
while
some
ask
questions
merely
to
be
sociable
my
aim
is
to
give
those
who
are
interested
in
the
welfare
of
the
people
of
mexico
and
might
wish
to
go
to
that
country
such
information
as
will
be
of
use
and
protect
them
from
being
misled
the
most
important
consideration
is
good
lands
with
perfect
titles
so
to
begin
can
good
lands
be
procured
in
mexico
yes
as
good
as
can
be
in
utah
or
any
country
i
have
ever
seen
are
the
titles
good
yes
there
are
many
large
tracts
of
good
land
suitable
for
colonizing
upon
that
the
titles
originated
in
spanish
grants
these
grants
are
proven
to
be
perfect
as
they
stand
good
under
all
tests
how
about
government
titles
it
is
the
report
that
a
mexican
title
for
land
is
not
very
reliable
how
does
this
report
come
about
there
is
no
reason
why
a
title
from
the
present
government
of
mexico
is
not
good
the
only
thing
necessary
is
to
get
your
location
right
people
of
this
country
often
make
mistakes
in
locating
properties
no
government
will
defend
a
person
on
lands
belonging
to
another
party
simply
because
they
would
like
to
have
it
and
make
a
wrong
location
can
a
person
settle
upon
and
procure
lands
in
mexico
the
same
as
in
the
united
states
no
there
are
no
such
laws
in
mexico
in
fact
at
the
present
time
that
republic
has
no
lands
to
be
considered
this
i
have
fully
shown
heretofore
your
question
must
apply
to
titled
properties
it
is
a
waste
of
time
to
ask
questions
about
government
lands
in
mexico
then
you
say
all
desirable
lands
must
be
bought
of
private
owners
yes
what
price
will
have
to
be
paid
for
these
lands
about
the
same
average
as
public
lands
in
this
country
how
is
that
i
have
often
heard
that
good
lands
could
be
bought
in
mexico
for
cents
per
acre
either
from
the
government
or
from
land
companies
who
have
control
of
large
tracts
well
my
friend
if
you
depend
upon
any
such
prospects
you
will
be
left
as
others
have
been
who
have
undertaken
to
get
cheap
lands
in
that
country
how
is
the
country
you
recommend
for
timber
is
there
plenty
and
of
what
kinds
pine
of
the
best
quality
is
in
great
abundance
as
well
as
considerable
oak
and
some
other
hard
woods
of
medium
quality
is
the
timber
in
the
mountains
and
canyons
the
same
as
here
in
utah
no
there
are
millions
of
acres
of
timber
lands
adjoining
the
tillable
valleys
that
the
timber
grows
upon
the
low
hills
and
upland
plateaus
where
teams
can
drive
among
the
timber
without
any
road
making
whatever
then
there
must
be
considerable
rain
fall
in
this
timbered
country
yes
there
are
thousands
of
inhabitants
living
in
the
district
who
never
pretend
to
irrigate
their
lands
and
they
raise
good
crops
generally
do
they
never
fail
of
crops
yes
sometimes
they
reckon
an
average
of
every
seven
years
for
drouth
would
it
not
be
safer
to
get
land
where
there
is
water
for
irrigation
in
case
it
should
be
needed
yes
i
would
not
buy
land
at
any
price
in
mexico
unless
there
was
a
reasonable
amount
of
water
belonging
to
the
land
then
you
do
not
like
to
depend
upon
the
rains
entirely
no
and
for
good
reason
we
have
found
by
experience
here
in
utah
that
irrigation
is
handy
and
profitable
a
great
variety
of
products
can
be
raised
as
we
can
apply
the
water
when
needed
when
we
depend
upon
rain
many
times
the
seasons
are
so
divided
that
we
have
the
extremes
of
wet
and
dry
this
is
common
in
the
district
of
mexico
that
i
recommend
for
settling
when
is
the
rainy
season
in
that
country
june
july
and
august
are
the
rainy
months
during
the
winter
season
there
is
considerable
rain
and
some
snow
oh
i
thought
it
was
an
awful
hot
country
how
is
it
you
have
snow
when
it
is
so
far
south
jones
you
must
be
mistaken
i
have
been
down
in
arizona
it
is
very
hot
there
too
hot
for
me
and
this
mexican
country
is
a
long
ways
further
south
and
you
say
you
have
snow
there
my
friend
you
must
study
the
geography
of
mexico
a
little
if
you
will
look
upon
the
map
of
mexico
and
find
the
state
of
chihuahua
you
will
observe
a
district
of
country
showing
where
several
streams
head
and
run
off
in
different
directions
some
running
for
hundreds
of
miles
north
so
you
see
on
entering
the
state
of
chihuahua
on
the
north
one
travels
for
several
days
the
facts
are
that
some
of
the
finest
and
most
fertile
mountain
valleys
of
that
country
are
as
shown
by
measurement
two
thousand
feet
higher
than
salt
lake
valley
so
if
zion
is
to
be
built
up
in
the
tops
of
the
mountains
we
lack
two
thousand
feet
of
being
there
yet
then
you
mean
to
say
the
climate
is
temperate
yes
the
altitude
preserves
us
from
the
heat
while
being
so
far
south
the
winters
are
moderate
all
who
have
ever
lived
in
the
district
admit
that
it
has
a
fine
climate
what
are
the
products
corn
beans
potatoes
melons
cabbage
onions
and
anything
common
to
a
temperate
climate
and
good
mellow
soil
is
or
can
be
raised
how
about
fruits
is
there
much
raised
there
while
it
is
one
of
the
best
fruit
countries
possible
judging
from
what
i
have
seen
there
is
but
little
progress
yet
by
the
natives
as
fruit
raisers
why
is
this
simply
this
like
in
most
everything
else
the
people
are
a
long
way
behind
they
know
nothing
about
grafting
or
budding
fruits
they
plant
the
seeds
and
let
them
grow
often
in
clusters
and
take
what
comes
i
have
seen
some
of
the
finest
seedling
apples
that
were
ever
produced
picked
from
trees
grown
in
a
thick
clump
without
any
cultivation
whatever
also
pears
apricots
plums
and
such
hardy
fruits
common
to
a
temperate
climate
how
about
grapes
it
is
too
cold
for
any
except
the
hardy
varieties
is
it
a
good
wheat
country
yes
wheat
does
quite
well
except
when
the
season
is
wet
about
harvest
time
when
like
all
rainy
countries
the
harvest
is
attended
with
difficulties
sometimes
the
wheat
is
damaged
by
rust
this
can
be
hindered
somewhat
by
drilling
the
wheat
giving
it
a
chance
to
ripen
early
and
not
so
apt
to
be
effected
by
damp
weather
as
thickly
sown
wheat
rye
oats
and
barley
do
well
how
is
the
range
splendid
the
whole
country
is
thickly
set
with
excellent
grass
then
if
it
is
a
thickly
timbered
county
with
plenty
of
grass
there
must
be
plenty
of
game
yes
there
are
deer
bear
and
wild
turkeys
in
great
abundance
a
person
fond
of
hunting
can
have
all
the
sport
he
wants
there
are
springs
of
pure
water
and
beautiful
mountain
streams
all
through
the
country
so
that
game
has
a
fine
chance
to
live
and
grow
fat
then
there
must
be
fish
in
these
mountain
streams
no
for
some
cause
these
streams
are
not
stocked
with
fish
of
much
worth
is
the
country
thickly
inhabited
are
there
towns
and
settlements
where
business
could
be
opened
up
if
the
country
was
thickly
settled
there
would
be
no
room
for
colonizers
there
are
several
towns
numbering
from
one
to
five
thousand
inhabitants
within
a
reasonable
distance
there
are
also
some
of
the
richest
mining
camps
of
mexico
in
the
district
of
country
that
would
furnish
an
excellent
market
for
all
products
raised
what
are
the
facilities
for
different
kind
of
manufactures
or
industries
stock
raising
especially
fine
horses
as
the
high
altitude
and
solid
surface
healthy
atmosphere
and
pure
water
would
be
adapted
to
breeding
a
superior
class
of
thoroughbreds
now
i
am
astonished
to
hear
you
recommend
the
raising
of
fine
horses
in
mexico
that
revolutionary
country
where
they
will
take
everything
a
man
owns
and
give
him
nothing
in
return
what
would
you
do
to
protect
your
fine
stock
now
to
answer
this
i
will
make
the
statement
as
given
to
me
by
many
of
the
old
settlers
of
the
district
i
am
writing
about
that
is
no
revolutions
or
wars
of
a
national
character
have
reached
that
district
for
over
a
hundred
years
except
to
defend
themselves
against
the
apaches
the
district
is
known
as
the
warrior
district
but
their
warriors
are
for
their
own
defence
and
protection
they
are
noted
for
minding
their
own
business
being
peaceable
when
let
alone
but
very
ugly
when
interfered
with
perfectly
honest
and
united
in
protecting
themselves
against
thieves
it
is
naturally
one
of
the
best
protected
countries
on
this
continent
and
a
reasonable
sized
colony
could
and
would
be
as
safe
there
as
any
place
upon
earth
would
cattle
raising
pay
that
is
one
of
the
principal
businesses
of
the
country
cattle
are
bought
annually
and
driven
from
that
country
to
the
united
states
is
it
a
good
sheep
country
yes
naturally
so
but
if
i
could
have
my
way
the
immediate
district
if
colonized
would
be
protected
from
sheep
depredations
if
there
is
a
people
on
earth
who
deserve
the
name
of
pirates
i
think
it
is
the
average
sheep
owner
of
utah
they
know
no
law
but
to
crowd
their
sheep
upon
any
and
every
place
where
they
can
live
regardless
of
the
rights
of
others
there
are
large
districts
of
country
in
northern
mexico
well
adapted
to
sheep
raising
not
suitable
for
farming
or
inhabiting
to
any
great
extent
sheep
men
should
be
satisfied
with
such
countries
and
not
crowd
themselves
upon
the
settlers
as
they
do
in
this
country
eating
off
the
range
from
the
home
stock
befouling
the
waters
and
filling
the
atmosphere
with
a
sickly
stench
for
the
greater
portion
of
the
summer
season
the
answer
to
this
is
that
it
is
for
revenue
yes
revenue
but
at
the
cost
of
the
comfort
health
and
lives
of
many
people
the
revenue
is
to
the
few
while
the
nuisance
is
to
the
many
anyone
wanting
a
sheep
ranch
in
mexico
had
better
not
apply
to
me
for
information
i
would
rather
wear
a
coat
made
of
australian
wool
than
have
a
healthy
happy
country
tramped
down
and
made
a
sickly
stinking
desert
by
herding
sheep
around
a
settlement
but
if
anyone
should
wish
to
start
a
woolen
factory
they
would
have
no
trouble
in
getting
all
the
wool
wanted
for
it
is
already
cheap
and
plentiful
would
a
tannery
pay
yes
hides
and
oak
bark
are
plentiful
that
really
would
be
one
of
the
most
profitable
industries
and
easiest
to
start
lumber
and
all
kinds
of
building
materials
being
near
at
hand
is
there
a
demand
for
mechanical
labor
my
supposition
is
that
a
thrifty
colony
would
demand
work
among
themselves
again
the
country
being
new
as
far
as
modern
improvements
are
concerned
would
when
an
example
was
set
naturally
begin
to
build
up
and
create
a
demand
for
many
kinds
of
labor
that
are
not
now
wanted
among
the
natives
it
is
a
country
naturally
rich
in
resources
and
would
soon
prosper
and
build
up
a
people
provided
they
applied
themselves
intelligently
and
industriously
to
improve
the
natural
privileges
how
is
the
government
do
you
think
a
man
can
live
there
in
peace
any
length
of
time
i
think
a
man
will
have
all
the
privilege
and
protection
that
could
be
reasonably
desired
well
now
why
wo
they
legislate
against
our
religion
in
time
there
just
the
same
as
is
being
done
here
that
is
too
big
a
question
to
be
answered
in
a
sentence
you
must
read
the
book
of
mormon
in
true
belief
realizing
that
it
is
true
and
plain
if
you
will
do
this
honestly
you
will
have
no
fears
about
the
future
in
mexico
well
now
how
can
a
person
be
protected
in
his
rights
by
going
slow
and
learning
how
from
some
one
who
is
capable
of
teaching
you
can
a
person
do
anything
in
the
country
you
recommend
no
sir
it
will
not
amount
to
anything
except
a
colony
of
sufficient
strength
and
means
to
get
a
good
tract
of
land
and
be
for
a
season
would
it
not
be
very
expensive
to
move
into
that
country
not
under
proper
system
and
organization
how
long
would
it
take
to
go
from
here
with
a
family
and
get
settled
to
work
about
fifteen
days
allowing
nothing
for
delays
how
far
is
it
from
the
railroad
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
miles
to
the
district
can
the
necessary
stock
be
procured
to
commence
with
yes
and
quite
reasonable
how
about
provisions
such
as
corn
beans
and
meat
are
in
abundance
flour
is
scarce
and
of
a
poor
quality
and
can
not
be
obtained
until
mills
are
built
as
the
natives
have
no
good
mills
the
flour
is
bad
but
the
corn
is
excellent
and
will
make
good
meal
which
will
answer
for
a
season
well
jones
i
have
sold
out
to
a
liberal
here
for
fifty
thousand
and
i
do
much
like
the
idea
of
going
without
my
cake
and
biscuit
ai
there
no
way
to
get
good
flour
oh
yes
you
can
get
it
for
about
nine
dollars
per
hundred
that
will
do
if
i
go
i
will
take
a
few
sacks
how
about
custom
duties
no
trouble
for
regular
colonizers
that
go
in
order
and
conform
to
the
laws
and
make
their
applications
beforehand
so
that
when
they
arrive
at
the
custom
house
they
are
known
as
colonizers
haphazzard
work
in
mexico
makes
trouble
the
same
as
in
any
other
country
do
you
think
there
will
be
much
of
a
move
from
this
country
to
mexico
i
did
think
so
at
one
time
but
i
am
now
under
the
impression
that
there
will
be
no
great
move
to
that
land
what
has
changed
your
opinion
simply
this
the
people
do
not
wish
to
go
the
inhabitants
of
utah
have
good
homes
and
have
made
up
their
minds
to
accept
the
situation
and
stay
and
enjoy
their
wealth
and
luxuries
the
same
as
other
people
then
you
have
given
up
the
idea
of
ever
seeing
a
prosperous
colony
of
mormons
settle
in
mexico
in
some
of
the
rich
valleys
that
you
have
been
recommending
so
long
no
sir
not
at
all
i
still
have
faith
in
the
move
those
who
have
faith
in
the
book
of
mormon
and
have
a
greater
desire
to
see
the
words
of
the
book
fulfilled
that
to
have
to
accumulate
wealth
will
go
then
you
think
it
will
be
at
the
sacrifice
of
worldly
wealth
and
comforts
that
people
will
take
hold
of
the
work
seemingly
so
but
not
in
reality
there
are
many
principles
revealed
to
this
people
that
we
are
slow
to
put
in
full
practice
among
others
united
order
a
principle
the
prophet
brigham
declared
would
have
to
be
practiced
before
further
advancement
would
be
made
by
this
people
while
the
majority
of
the
people
called
saints
are
inclined
to
look
with
suspicion
on
any
move
in
that
direction
the
natives
of
mexico
favor
and
in
a
good
degree
practice
the
principle
a
short
description
of
their
mode
of
farming
will
illustrate
this
in
the
spring
when
planting
time
comes
all
join
together
and
go
into
the
field
of
one
party
and
plow
and
put
in
the
seed
the
poor
man
who
has
no
cattle
shares
the
same
as
the
wealthy
this
they
continue
until
all
the
fields
of
the
village
are
planted
if
any
lack
seed
it
is
loaned
to
them
if
there
is
a
scarcity
of
provisions
the
first
field
products
fit
for
use
instead
of
being
sold
at
an
exorbitant
price
become
common
property
and
all
the
hungry
partake
of
the
blessing
when
the
crops
are
gathered
in
the
owner
of
the
early
field
receives
such
as
his
neighbors
feel
free
to
give
him
which
is
always
liberal
in
quantity
now
i
would
not
advocate
the
doing
just
as
these
natives
do
but
will
say
this
their
customs
show
that
they
have
a
principle
of
union
and
good
fellowship
among
them
that
could
easily
be
trained
into
more
successful
principles
of
union
they
are
true
israelites
descendants
of
the
jews
and
having
left
jerusalem
before
the
crucifixion
of
the
savior
have
not
that
curse
resting
upon
them
but
on
the
contrary
have
the
merit
of
having
descended
from
a
people
who
received
the
savior
and
the
gospel
and
lived
for
hundreds
of
years
in
a
condition
of
peace
union
and
intelligence
far
beyond
the
church
at
jerusalem
they
are
entitled
to
the
gospel
according
to
the
book
of
mormon
immediately
following
the
work
among
the
gentiles
the
day
of
their
deliverance
can
not
be
far
away
for
if
the
fullness
of
the
gentiles
is
not
close
at
hand
the
saints
must
have
a
hard
experience
before
them
now
to
finish
up
this
work
i
wish
to
give
a
few
of
my
own
observations
and
reflections
the
sketches
of
history
i
have
given
as
they
occurred
to
me
my
descriptions
of
country
and
inhabitants
according
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
after
years
of
study
and
acquaintance
no
person
can
describe
a
country
from
a
single
visit
sufficiently
well
to
predicate
a
reliable
report
upon
unless
receiving
information
from
a
most
and
intelligent
source
for
this
reason
i
have
always
made
it
a
rule
to
visit
country
where
convenient
at
different
times
and
seasons
also
to
inquire
from
different
disinterested
parties
watching
closely
the
general
reports
the
judge
on
his
bench
allows
a
person
general
reputation
to
be
a
proper
question
for
proof
but
will
not
allow
direct
individual
testimony
neither
good
nor
bad
this
rule
should
largely
apply
in
determining
the
quality
and
conditions
of
a
country
if
the
reputation
is
generally
good
then
we
may
look
favorably
on
the
subject
but
if
bad
like
the
person
with
a
bad
reputation
we
should
be
careful
in
dealing
with
them
sometimes
when
speaking
of
certain
tracts
of
land
in
mexico
persons
will
ask
me
if
the
titles
are
good
when
i
tell
them
yes
they
will
ask
how
do
you
know
i
hear
people
are
often
deceived
about
titles
how
do
you
know
they
are
good
there
was
an
old
lady
told
me
the
title
is
good
now
this
might
seem
a
light
answer
but
in
reality
is
not
the
old
lady
answers
on
general
reputation
and
many
times
more
reliable
than
an
interested
party
of
course
this
information
is
preliminary
but
it
will
many
times
enable
a
person
to
form
an
opinion
as
to
whether
it
will
pay
to
make
further
investigation
i
would
rather
take
the
friendly
report
of
a
neighbor
about
the
titles
of
a
mexican
ranch
than
i
would
the
information
of
an
officer
of
state
that
might
have
an
ax
to
grind
people
who
visit
president
diaz
and
cabinet
when
on
land
business
in
mexico
are
likely
to
be
kindly
treated
and
receive
such
information
as
his
excellency
and
associates
have
to
give
but
individually
i
have
always
found
it
best
to
get
posted
from
the
neighbors
or
owners
i
came
from
mexico
to
utah
nearly
forty
years
ago
i
have
been
interested
in
that
country
and
people
from
that
time
until
the
present
i
have
often
met
elders
whose
faith
and
testimony
seemed
strong
yet
seemed
to
have
but
little
faith
or
interest
in
the
work
among
the
remnants
spoken
of
in
the
book
of
mormon
to
me
this
has
always
seemed
strange
we
are
all
looking
forward
to
the
time
soon
coming
when
the
gospel
will
be
withdrawn
from
the
gentiles
and
go
to
the
jews
of
which
the
remnants
are
descendants
so
says
the
book
of
doctrine
and
covenants
there
can
be
no
question
but
the
turning
of
the
gospel
from
the
gentile
to
the
jew
means
first
to
the
remnants
any
one
studying
the
book
of
mormon
carefully
can
not
help
but
see
that
the
word
is
to
be
carried
to
the
remnants
it
might
be
easier
and
more
convenient
to
make
a
tour
to
jerusalem
but
it
wo
fill
the
bill
the
remnants
must
be
preached
to
then
they
will
believe
and
come
to
a
knowledge
of
jesus
we
who
have
been
gathered
from
the
gentile
world
have
the
promise
of
coming
in
and
being
numbered
with
the
remnants
and
helping
them
to
build
up
the
new
jerusalem
provided
we
harden
not
our
hearts
now
what
does
this
hardening
of
hearts
mean
i
will
suppose
a
character
and
see
if
it
will
apply
a
person
hears
the
gospel
his
heart
is
pricked
and
naturally
softened
the
love
of
god
and
the
testimony
of
jesus
comes
upon
him
he
goes
forth
after
receiving
the
blessings
of
the
ordinances
and
preaches
the
gospel
to
his
friends
and
countrymen
and
baptizes
many
teaches
them
their
duty
and
finally
gathers
to
zion
then
he
settles
down
to
the
duties
of
home
and
life
among
the
saints
he
is
prospered
and
blessed
his
heart
is
warm
and
soft
he
enters
into
all
the
duties
common
to
a
faithful
elder
his
family
increases
he
is
persecuted
for
his
belief
and
practice
all
this
he
stands
and
feels
good
in
doing
his
duty
and
maintaining
his
to
principles
now
this
man
has
been
gathered
out
from
the
gentiles
and
will
have
the
privilege
of
being
numbered
with
the
remnants
if
he
hardens
not
his
heart
now
why
should
such
an
individual
harden
his
heart
what
motive
or
cause
could
there
possibly
be
for
the
hardening
of
the
heart
it
may
come
in
this
way
the
lamanites
are
a
poor
and
to
the
rich
and
refined
looked
upon
as
a
dirty
degraded
people
still
the
lord
has
promised
that
those
of
the
gentile
world
who
receive
the
words
of
the
book
should
carry
them
to
the
remnants
now
will
we
do
this
or
will
our
riches
hinder
us
when
the
time
comes
doubtless
there
will
be
some
who
will
say
i
am
not
interested
in
these
dirty
indians
possibly
this
is
what
hardening
of
the
heart
means
some
would
apply
this
to
the
whole
world
who
reject
the
gospel
i
think
it
more
consistent
to
apply
it
to
the
elder
who
has
received
the
gospel
and
had
his
heart
softened
to
his
duty
and
then
allows
it
to
become
hardened
through
prosperity
to
those
who
suppose
the
lamanites
all
low
and
degraded
i
will
add
this
to
what
i
have
already
said
in
their
favor
there
are
thousands
of
the
finest
artisans
upon
earth
among
the
remnants
also
many
of
them
are
educated
and
refined
and
as
for
natural
intellect
who
ever
saw
an
indian
who
was
a
dunce
without
the
aid
of
the
remnants
this
people
never
would
amount
to
much
we
have
increased
and
built
up
beyond
any
other
people
yet
our
numbers
are
small
considering
the
great
work
before
us
many
will
say
wait
the
time
has
not
come
to
preach
to
the
remnants
possibly
this
is
so
in
a
measure
still
i
never
could
believe
but
what
many
of
the
people
have
been
ready
for
some
time
past
the
mission
to
labor
among
the
remnants
has
never
been
a
popular
work
there
are
too
many
sacrifices
to
make
there
is
not
an
elder
who
has
labored
faithfully
for
the
welfare
of
the
indians
but
what
has
been
brought
under
trying
ordeals
many
times
suffering
worse
than
death
it
is
no
wonder
that
but
few
have
stuck
to
the
work
there
will
doubtless
be
a
change
when
a
more
general
spirit
of
preaching
to
the
remnants
come
over
the
elders
missions
will
be
conducted
in
a
more
systematic
manner
more
wisdom
will
be
given
and
support
extended
i
have
seen
this
church
and
people
pass
through
many
trials
they
have
always
been
able
to
stand
and
gain
strength
through
their
various
experiences
the
gospel
teaches
us
that
we
should
be
ready
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
our
religion
but
i
have
never
been
convinced
that
we
have
a
right
to
sacrifice
in
the
least
any
portion
of
our
religion
either
individually
or
as
a
people
for
the
sake
of
convenience
our
enemies
the
wicked
of
the
world
have
been
crowding
upon
us
from
the
beginning
seeking
to
make
us
abandon
the
principles
god
has
revealed
until
now
we
are
virtually
denied
the
rights
of
citizenship
unless
we
abandon
our
religion
the
concessions
we
have
lately
made
whether
it
has
done
us
any
good
or
not
has
fully
proven
to
god
and
man
that
there
is
no
honesty
in
the
propositions
made
no
concession
will
satisfy
our
enemies
short
of
down
right
apostasy
if
this
people
would
really
become
wicked
and
fully
practice
the
abominations
common
to
the
present
generation
then
we
could
vote
hold
office
and
be
good
citizens
to
say
that
the
practices
of
this
people
can
not
be
tolerated
in
the
nation
as
a
religion
is
to
say
that
the
teachings
of
the
bible
can
not
be
allowed
as
religion
for
there
is
not
a
principle
taught
or
practiced
as
religion
by
this
people
except
bible
doctrines
and
precepts
this
the
world
knows
and
have
acknowledged
as
often
as
our
principles
have
been
put
to
the
test
many
look
forward
to
some
move
of
importance
taking
place
within
a
year
or
two
sometimes
i
am
asked
if
i
have
an
idea
yes
well
what
is
it
i
believe
it
will
not
be
long
before
the
saints
will
acknowledge
that
the
wisdom
of
man
will
not
do
to
depend
upon
and
turn
unto
the
lord
and
ask
him
in
sincerity
to
direct
them
through
his
servants
whom
he
has
commissioned
to
lead
israel
politics
will
not
do
there
are
powers
that
will
beat
us
when
we
depend
on
our
smartness
it
may
be
a
little
humiliating
to
acknowledge
but
the
world
are
smarter
in
some
things
than
we
are
young
utah
will
never
do
to
lead
this
people
whenever
we
undertake
to
get
ahead
in
any
way
of
the
wisdom
of
our
elders
then
we
will
fail
to
put
a
man
forward
as
our
best
man
because
of
any
earthly
success
will
never
do
history
points
to
a
time
when
our
rulers
in
this
nation
were
honest
and
wise
laws
were
made
for
the
good
of
the
whole
people
no
speculative
jobs
were
put
up
in
those
days
both
brains
and
principles
were
in
demand
as
the
nation
advanced
wealth
became
principal
until
today
there
is
but
little
said
about
the
intelligence
honesty
and
capability
of
national
leaders
only
as
financiers
and
telling
of
the
luxury
and
extravagance
of
their
wives
and
daughters
this
wave
of
luxurious
desire
has
even
reached
to
salt
lake
city
and
made
a
little
ripple
here
during
our
last
grand
campaign
if
we
will
look
back
calmly
we
will
remember
that
financial
ability
was
the
main
cry
the
lord
will
not
change
his
laws
and
commandments
to
suit
the
proud
and
wealthy
wealth
leads
in
the
world
but
principles
will
lead
this
people
wealth
does
not
necessarily
do
away
with
principles
neither
does
wealth
prove
that
principle
exists
so
the
first
great
move
before
this
people
will
be
to
fall
into
line
and
be
governed
fully
and
willingly
by
the
principles
of
the
gospel
the
questions
are
often
asked
how
long
will
it
be
before
the
power
of
the
wicked
is
broken
how
long
will
this
people
be
annoyed
and
oppressed
by
their
enemies
this
i
can
not
answer
but
i
refer
the
reader
to
page
of
the
book
of
mormon
showing
clearly
that
there
is
a
certain
work
to
be
done
before
the
wicked
will
be
used
up
any
one
reflecting
reasonably
upon
the
great
work
will
see
that
it
will
necessarily
take
time
nothing
can
be
done
only
in
order
god
has
promised
to
hasten
his
work
but
he
has
not
promised
to
violate
his
laws
for
our
convenience
it
must
of
necessity
take
a
few
years
of
diligent
labor
from
many
of
the
elders
of
the
church
for
anyone
to
suppose
that
the
wicked
will
be
destroyed
for
our
protection
before
the
remnants
are
ministered
to
is
not
faith
but
presumption
biographies
generally
end
with
death
romances
with
marriage
i
am
not
expecting
to
for
many
years
to
come
as
i
am
still
strong
and
healthy
transcriber
