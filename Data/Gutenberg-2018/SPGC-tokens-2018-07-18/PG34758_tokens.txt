rudolf
kesselbach
nicknamed
alternatively
the
king
of
diamonds
and
the
lord
of
the
cape
possessed
a
fortune
estimated
at
nearly
twenty
millions
sterling
for
the
past
week
he
had
occupied
suite
on
the
fourth
floor
of
the
palace
hotel
consisting
of
three
rooms
of
which
the
two
larger
on
the
right
the
and
the
principal
bedroom
faced
the
avenue
while
the
other
on
the
left
in
which
chapman
the
secretary
slept
looked
out
on
the
rue
de
judée
adjoining
this
bedroom
a
suite
of
five
rooms
had
been
reserved
for
kesselbach
who
was
to
leave
monte
carlo
where
she
was
at
present
staying
and
join
her
husband
the
moment
she
heard
from
him
rudolf
kesselbach
walked
up
and
down
for
a
few
minutes
with
a
thoughtful
air
he
was
a
tall
man
with
a
ruddy
complexion
and
still
young
and
his
dreamy
eyes
which
showed
pale
blue
through
his
spectacles
gave
him
an
expression
of
gentleness
and
shyness
that
contrasted
curiously
with
the
strength
of
the
square
forehead
and
the
jaws
he
went
to
the
window
it
was
fastened
besides
how
could
any
one
have
entered
that
way
the
private
balcony
that
ran
round
the
flat
broke
off
on
the
right
and
was
separated
on
the
left
by
a
stone
channel
from
the
balconies
in
the
rue
de
judée
he
went
to
his
bedroom
it
had
no
communication
with
the
neighboring
rooms
he
went
to
his
secretary
bedroom
the
door
that
led
into
the
five
rooms
reserved
for
kesselbach
was
locked
and
bolted
i
ca
understand
it
at
all
chapman
time
after
time
i
have
noticed
things
here
funny
things
as
you
must
admit
yesterday
my
was
moved
the
day
before
that
my
papers
had
certainly
been
touched
and
yet
how
was
it
possible
it
is
not
possible
sir
cried
chapman
whose
honest
placid
features
displayed
no
anxiety
you
imagining
things
that
all
you
have
no
proof
nothing
but
impressions
to
go
upon
besides
look
here
there
is
no
way
into
this
suite
except
through
the
very
well
you
had
a
special
key
made
on
the
day
of
our
arrival
and
your
own
man
edwards
has
the
only
duplicate
do
you
trust
him
of
course
i
do
he
been
with
me
for
ten
years
but
edwards
goes
to
lunch
at
the
same
time
that
we
do
and
that
a
mistake
he
must
not
go
down
in
future
until
we
come
back
chapman
gave
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
the
lord
of
the
cape
was
becoming
a
trifle
eccentric
with
those
incomprehensible
fears
of
his
what
risk
can
you
run
in
an
hotel
especially
when
you
carry
no
valuables
no
important
sum
of
money
on
you
or
with
you
they
heard
the
opening
it
was
edwards
kesselbach
called
him
are
you
dressed
edwards
ah
that
right
i
am
expecting
no
visitors
edwards
or
rather
one
visitor
only
gourel
meantime
remain
in
the
lobby
and
keep
an
eye
on
the
door
chapman
and
i
have
some
serious
work
to
do
the
serious
work
lasted
for
a
few
minutes
during
which
kesselbach
went
through
his
correspondence
read
three
or
four
letters
and
gave
instructions
how
they
were
to
be
answered
but
suddenly
chapman
waiting
with
pen
poised
saw
that
kesselbach
was
thinking
of
something
quite
different
from
his
correspondence
he
was
holding
between
his
fingers
and
attentively
examining
a
pin
a
black
pin
bent
like
a
chapman
he
said
look
what
i
found
on
the
table
this
bent
pin
obviously
means
something
it
a
proof
a
material
piece
of
evidence
you
ca
pretend
now
that
no
one
has
been
in
the
room
for
after
all
this
pin
did
not
come
here
of
itself
certainly
not
replied
the
secretary
it
came
here
through
me
what
do
you
mean
why
it
a
pin
which
i
used
to
fasten
my
tie
to
my
collar
i
took
it
out
last
night
while
you
were
reading
and
i
twisted
it
mechanically
kesselbach
rose
from
his
chair
with
a
great
air
of
vexation
took
a
few
steps
and
stopped
you
laughing
at
me
chapman
i
feel
you
are
and
you
quite
right
i
wo
deny
it
i
have
been
rather
odd
since
my
last
journey
to
the
cape
it
because
well
you
do
know
the
new
factor
in
my
life
a
tremendous
plan
a
huge
thing
i
can
only
see
it
as
yet
in
the
haze
of
the
future
but
it
taking
shape
for
all
that
and
it
will
be
something
colossal
ah
chapman
you
ca
imagine
money
i
do
care
a
fig
for
i
have
money
i
have
too
much
money
but
this
this
means
a
great
deal
more
it
means
power
might
authority
if
the
reality
comes
up
to
my
expectations
i
shall
be
not
only
lord
of
the
cape
but
lord
of
other
realms
as
well
rudolf
kesselbach
the
son
of
the
augsburg
ironmonger
will
be
on
a
par
with
many
people
who
till
now
have
looked
down
upon
him
he
will
even
take
precedence
of
them
chapman
he
will
take
precedence
of
them
mark
my
words
and
if
ever
i
he
interrupted
himself
looked
at
chapman
as
though
he
regretted
having
said
too
much
and
nevertheless
carried
away
by
his
excitement
concluded
you
now
understand
the
reasons
of
my
anxiety
chapman
here
in
this
brain
is
an
idea
that
is
worth
a
great
deal
and
this
idea
is
suspected
perhaps
and
i
am
being
spied
upon
convinced
of
it
a
bell
sounded
the
telephone
said
chapman
could
it
muttered
kesselbach
by
any
chance
be
he
took
down
the
instrument
hullo
who
the
colonel
ah
good
yes
it
any
news
good
then
i
shall
expect
you
you
will
come
with
one
of
your
men
very
well
what
no
we
sha
be
disturbed
i
will
give
the
necessary
orders
it
as
serious
as
that
is
it
i
tell
you
my
instructions
will
be
positive
my
secretary
and
my
man
shall
keep
the
door
and
no
one
shall
be
allowed
in
you
know
the
way
do
you
then
do
lose
a
minute
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
said
chapman
there
are
two
gentlemen
coming
edwards
will
show
them
in
but
gourel
the
he
will
come
later
in
an
hour
and
even
then
there
no
harm
in
their
meeting
so
send
edwards
down
to
the
office
at
once
to
tell
them
i
am
at
home
to
nobody
except
two
gentlemen
the
colonel
and
his
friend
and
gourel
he
must
make
them
take
down
the
names
chapman
did
as
he
was
asked
when
he
returned
to
the
room
he
found
kesselbach
holding
in
his
hand
an
envelope
or
rather
a
little
in
black
morocco
leather
apparently
empty
he
seemed
to
hesitate
as
though
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
it
should
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
or
lay
it
down
elsewhere
at
last
he
went
to
the
mantelpiece
and
threw
the
leather
envelope
into
his
let
us
finish
the
mail
chapman
we
have
ten
minutes
left
ah
a
letter
from
kesselbach
why
did
you
tell
me
of
it
chapman
did
you
recognize
the
handwriting
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
the
emotion
which
he
felt
in
touching
and
contemplating
that
paper
which
his
wife
had
held
in
her
fingers
and
to
which
she
had
added
a
look
of
her
eyes
an
atom
of
her
scent
a
suggestion
of
her
secret
thoughts
he
inhaled
its
perfume
and
unsealing
it
read
the
letter
slowly
in
an
undertone
in
fragments
that
reached
chapman
ears
feeling
a
little
tired
shall
keep
my
room
i
feel
so
bored
when
can
i
come
to
you
i
am
longing
for
your
wire
you
telegraphed
this
morning
chapman
then
kesselbach
will
be
here
wednesday
he
seemed
quite
gay
as
though
the
weight
of
his
business
had
been
suddenly
relieved
and
he
freed
from
all
anxiety
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
heaved
a
deep
breath
like
a
strong
man
certain
of
success
like
a
lucky
man
who
possessed
happiness
and
who
was
big
enough
to
defend
himself
there
some
one
ringing
chapman
some
one
ringing
at
the
hall
door
go
and
see
who
it
is
but
edwards
entered
and
said
two
gentlemen
asking
for
you
sir
they
are
the
ones
i
know
are
they
there
in
the
lobby
yes
sir
close
the
and
do
open
it
again
except
to
gourel
the
you
go
and
bring
the
gentlemen
in
chapman
and
tell
them
that
i
would
like
to
speak
to
the
colonel
first
to
the
colonel
alone
edwards
and
chapman
left
the
room
shutting
the
door
after
them
rudolf
kesselbach
went
to
the
window
and
pressed
his
forehead
against
the
glass
outside
just
below
his
eyes
the
carriages
and
rolled
along
in
parallel
furrows
marked
by
the
double
line
of
refuges
a
bright
spring
sun
made
the
and
the
varnish
gleam
again
the
trees
were
putting
forth
their
first
green
shoots
and
the
buds
of
the
tall
chestnuts
were
beginning
to
unfold
their
leaves
what
on
earth
is
chapman
doing
muttered
kesselbach
the
time
he
wastes
in
palavering
he
took
a
cigarette
from
the
table
lit
it
and
drew
a
few
puffs
a
faint
exclamation
escaped
him
close
before
him
stood
a
man
whom
he
did
not
know
he
started
back
who
are
you
the
man
he
was
a
individual
rather
with
dark
hair
a
dark
moustache
and
hard
eyes
the
man
gave
a
grin
who
am
i
why
the
colonel
no
no
the
one
i
call
the
colonel
the
one
who
writes
to
me
under
that
adopted
signature
is
not
you
yes
yes
the
other
was
only
but
my
dear
sir
all
this
you
know
is
not
of
the
smallest
importance
the
essential
thing
is
that
i
am
myself
and
that
i
assure
you
i
but
your
name
sir
the
colonel
until
further
orders
kesselbach
was
seized
with
a
growing
fear
who
was
this
man
what
did
he
want
with
him
he
called
out
chapman
what
a
funny
idea
to
call
out
is
my
company
enough
for
you
chapman
kesselbach
cried
again
chapman
edwards
chapman
edwards
echoed
the
stranger
in
his
turn
what
are
you
doing
you
wanted
sir
i
ask
you
i
order
you
to
let
me
pass
but
my
dear
sir
who
preventing
you
he
politely
made
way
kesselbach
walked
to
the
door
opened
it
and
gave
a
sudden
jump
backward
behind
the
door
stood
another
man
pistol
in
hand
kesselbach
stammered
edwards
chap
he
did
not
finish
in
a
corner
of
the
lobby
he
saw
his
secretary
and
his
servant
lying
side
by
side
on
the
floor
gagged
and
bound
kesselbach
notwithstanding
his
nervous
and
excitable
nature
was
not
devoid
of
physical
courage
and
the
sense
of
a
definite
danger
instead
of
depressing
him
restored
all
his
elasticity
and
vigor
pretending
dismay
and
stupefaction
he
moved
slowly
back
to
the
chimneypiece
and
leant
against
the
wall
his
hand
felt
for
the
electric
bell
he
found
it
and
pressed
the
button
without
removing
his
finger
well
asked
the
stranger
kesselbach
made
no
reply
and
continued
to
press
the
button
well
do
you
expect
they
will
come
that
the
whole
hotel
is
in
commotion
because
you
are
pressing
that
bell
why
my
dear
sir
look
behind
you
and
you
will
see
that
the
wire
is
cut
kesselbach
turned
round
sharply
as
though
he
wanted
to
make
sure
but
instead
with
a
quick
movement
he
seized
the
thrust
his
hand
into
it
grasped
a
revolver
aimed
it
at
the
man
and
pulled
the
trigger
whew
said
the
stranger
so
you
load
your
weapons
with
air
and
silence
the
cock
clicked
a
second
time
and
a
third
but
there
was
no
report
three
shots
more
lord
of
the
cape
i
sha
be
satisfied
till
lodged
six
bullets
in
my
carcass
what
you
give
up
that
a
pity
you
were
making
excellent
practice
he
took
hold
of
a
chair
by
the
back
spun
it
round
sat
down
and
pointing
to
an
said
wo
you
take
a
seat
my
dear
sir
and
make
yourself
at
home
a
cigarette
not
for
me
thanks
i
prefer
a
cigar
there
was
a
box
on
the
table
he
selected
an
upmann
light
in
color
and
flawless
in
shape
lit
it
and
with
a
bow
thank
you
that
a
perfect
cigar
and
now
let
have
a
chat
shall
we
rudolf
kesselbach
listened
to
him
in
amazement
who
could
this
strange
person
be
still
at
the
sight
of
his
visitor
sitting
there
so
quiet
and
so
chatty
he
became
gradually
reassured
and
began
to
think
that
the
situation
might
come
to
an
end
without
any
need
to
resort
to
violence
or
brute
force
he
took
out
a
opened
it
displayed
a
respectable
bundle
of
and
asked
how
much
the
other
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
bewilderment
as
though
he
found
a
difficulty
in
understanding
what
kesselbach
meant
then
after
a
moment
he
called
marco
the
man
with
the
revolver
stepped
forward
marco
this
gentleman
is
good
enough
to
offer
you
a
few
bits
of
paper
for
your
young
woman
take
them
marco
still
aiming
his
revolver
with
his
right
hand

time
to
stand
on
the
defensive
rudolf
kesselbach
was
tied
up
in
a
network
of
cords
that
cut
into
his
flesh
at
the
least
attempt
which
he
made
to
struggle
his
arms
were
fixed
behind
his
back
his
body
fastened
to
the
chair
and
his
legs
tied
together
like
the
legs
of
a
mummy

what
about
you

i
shall
stay
oh
i
not
afraid
i
never
been
in
less
danger
than
at
this
moment
your
orders
about
the
door
were
positive
kesselbach
were
they
not
yes
dash
it
all
you
seemed
very
eager
to
get
that
said
can
you
have
been
trying
to
gain
time
if
so
i
should
be
caught
in
a
trap
like
a
fool
he
stopped
to
think
looked
at
his
prisoner
and
concluded
no
it
not
possible
we
shall
not
be
disturbed
he
had
not
finished
speaking
when
the
rang
he
pressed
his
hand
violently
on
rudolf
kesselbach
mouth
oh
you
old
fox
you
were
expecting
some
one
the
captive
eyes
gleamed
with
hope
he
could
be
heard
chuckling
under
the
hand
that
stifled
him
the
stranger
shook
with
rage
hold
your
tongue
or
i
strangle
you
here
marco
gag
him
quick
that
it
the
bell
rang
again
he
shouted
as
though
he
himself
were
kesselbach
and
as
though
edwards
were
still
there
why
do
you
open
the
door
edwards
then
he
went
softly
into
the
lobby
and
pointing
to
the
secretary
and
the
manservant
whispered
marco
help
me
shift
these
two
into
the
bedroom
over
there
so
that
they
ca
be
seen
he
lifted
the
secretary
marco
carried
the
servant
good
now
go
back
to
the
he
followed
him
in
and
at
once
returned
to
the
lobby
and
said
in
a
loud
tone
of
astonishment
why
your
man
not
here
kesselbach
no
do
move
finish
your
letter
i
go
myself
and
he
quietly
opened
the
mr
kesselbach
he
found
himself
faced
by
a
sort
of
jovial
giant
who
stood
swinging
from
one
foot
to
the
other
and
twisting
the
brim
of
his
hat
between
his
fingers
he
answered
yes
that
right
who
shall
i
say
kesselbach
telephoned
he
expects
me
oh
it
you
i
tell
him
do
you
mind
waiting
a
minute
kesselbach
will
speak
to
you
he
had
the
audacity
to
leave
the
visitor
standing
on
the
threshold
of
the
little
at
a
place
from
which
he
could
see
a
portion
of
the
through
the
open
door
and
slowly
without
so
much
as
turning
round
he
entered
the
room
went
to
his
confederate
by
kesselbach
side
and
whispered
we
done
it
gourel
the
detective
the
other
drew
his
knife
he
caught
him
by
the
arm
no
nonsense
i
have
an
idea
but
for
god
sake
marco
understand
me
and
speak
in
your
turn
speak
if
you
were
you
hear
marco
you
kesselbach
he
expressed
himself
so
coolly
so
forcibly
and
with
such
authority
that
marco
understood
without
further
explanation
that
he
himself
was
to
play
the
part
of
kesselbach
marco
said
so
as
to
be
heard
you
must
apologize
for
me
my
dear
fellow
tell
gourel
i
awfully
sorry
but
i
over
head
and
ears
in
work
i
will
see
him
morning
at
nine
yes
at
nine
punctually
good
whispered
the
other
do
stir
he
went
back
to
the
lobby
found
gourel
waiting
and
said
kesselbach
begs
you
to
excuse
him
he
is
finishing
an
important
piece
of
work
could
you
possibly
come
back
at
nine
morning
there
was
a
pause
gourel
seemed
surprised
more
or
less
bothered
and
undecided
the
other
man
hand
clutched
the
handle
of
a
knife
at
the
bottom
of
his
pocket
at
the
first
suspicious
movement
he
was
prepared
to
strike
at
last
gourel
said
very
well
at
nine
but
all
the
same
however
i
shall
be
here
at
nine
and
putting
on
his
hat
he
disappeared
down
the
passage
of
the
hotel
marco
in
the
burst
out
laughing
that
was
jolly
clever
of
you
governor
oh
how
nicely
you
spoofed
him
look
alive
marco
and
follow
him
if
he
leaves
the
hotel
let
him
be
meet
jérôme
at
the
as
arranged
and
telephone
marco
went
away
quickly
then
the
man
took
a
on
the
chimneypiece
poured
himself
out
a
tumblerful
which
he
swallowed
at
a
draught
wetted
his
handkerchief
dabbed
his
forehead
which
was
covered
with
perspiration
and
then
sat
down
beside
his
prisoner
and
with
an
affectation
of
politeness
said
but
i
must
really
have
the
honor
kesselbach
of
introducing
myself
to
you
and
taking
a
card
from
his
pocket
he
said
allow
me
arsène
lupin
the
name
of
the
famous
adventurer
seemed
to
make
the
best
of
impressions
upon
kesselbach
lupin
did
not
fail
to
observe
the
fact
and
exclaimed
aha
my
dear
sir
you
breathe
again
arsène
lupin
is
a
delicate
squeamish
burglar
he
loathes
bloodshed
he
has
never
committed
a
more
serious
crime
than
that
of
annexing
other
people
property
a
mere
peccadillo
eh
and
what
you
saying
to
yourself
is
that
he
is
not
going
to
burden
his
conscience
with
a
useless
murder
quite
so
but
will
your
destruction
be
so
useless
as
all
that
everything
depends
on
the
answer
and
i
assure
you
that
i
not
larking
at
present
come
on
old
chap
he
drew
up
his
chair
beside
the
removed
the
prisoner
gag
and
speaking
very
plainly
kesselbach
he
said
on
the
day
when
you
arrived
in
paris
you
entered
into
relations
with
one
barbareux
the
manager
of
a
confidential
inquiry
agency
and
as
you
were
acting
without
the
knowledge
of
your
secretary
chapman
it
was
arranged
that
the
said
barbareux
when
communicating
with
you
by
letter
or
telephone
should
call
himself
colonel
i
hasten
to
tell
you
that
barbareux
is
a
perfectly
honest
man
but
i
have
the
good
fortune
to
number
one
of
his
clerks
among
my
own
particular
friends
that
is
how
i
discovered
the
motive
of
your
application
to
barbareux
and
how
i
came
to
interest
myself
in
you
and
to
make
a
search
or
two
here
with
the
assistance
of
a
set
of
false
keys
in
the
course
of
which
search
or
two
i
may
as
well
tell
you
i
did
not
find
what
i
was
looking
for
he
lowered
his
voice
and
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
eyes
of
his
prisoner
watching
his
expression
searching
his
secret
thoughts
he
uttered
these
words
kesselbach
your
instructions
to
barbareux
were
that
he
should
find
a
man
hidden
somewhere
in
the
slums
of
paris
who
bears
or
used
to
bear
the
name
of
pierre
leduc
the
man
answers
to
this
brief
description
height
five
feet
nine
inches
hair
and
complexion
fair
wears
a
moustache
special
mark
the
tip
of
the
little
finger
of
the
left
hand
is
missing
as
the
result
of
a
cut
also
he
has
an
almost
imperceptible
scar
on
the
right
cheek
you
seem
to
attach
enormous
importance
to
this
man
discovery
as
though
it
might
lead
to
some
great
advantage
to
yourself
who
is
the
man
i
do
know
the
answer
was
positive
absolute
did
he
know
or
did
he
not
know
it
made
little
difference
the
great
thing
was
that
he
was
determined
not
to
speak
very
well
said
his
adversary
but
you
have
fuller
particulars
about
him
than
those
with
which
you
furnished
barbareux
i
have
not
you
lie
kesselbach
twice
in
barbareux
presence
you
consulted
papers
contained
in
the
morocco
case
i
did
and
the
case
burnt
lupin
quivered
with
rage
the
thought
of
torture
and
of
the
facilities
which
it
used
to
offer
was
evidently
passing
through
his
mind
again
burnt
but
the
box
come
own
up
confess
that
the
box
is
at
the
crédit
lyonnais
yes
and
what
inside
it
the
finest
two
hundred
diamonds
in
my
private
collection
this
statement
did
not
seem
to
displease
the
adventurer
aha
the
finest
two
hundred
diamonds
but
i
say
that
a
fortune
yes
that
makes
you
smile
it
a
trifle
to
you
no
doubt
and
your
secret
is
worth
more
than
that
to
you
yes
but
to
me
he
took
a
cigar
lit
a
match
which
he
allowed
to
go
out
again
mechanically
and
sat
for
some
time
thinking
motionless
the
minutes
passed
he
began
to
laugh
i
dare
say
you
hoping
that
the
expedition
will
come
to
nothing
and
that
they
wo
open
the
safe
very
likely
old
chap
but
in
that
case
you
have
to
pay
me
for
my
trouble
i
did
not
come
here
to
see
what
sort
of
figure
you
cut
in
an
the
diamonds
since
diamonds
there
appear
to
be
or
else
the
morocco
case
there
your
dilemma
he
looked
at
his
watch
half
an
hour
hang
it
all
fate
is
moving
very
slowly
but
there
nothing
for
you
to
grin
at
kesselbach
i
shall
not
go
back
make
no
mistake
about
that
at
last
it
was
the
lupin
snatched
at
the
receiver
and
changing
the
sound
of
his
voice
imitated
the
rough
accent
of
his
prisoner
yes
rudolf
kesselbach
you
speaking
to
him
yes
please
mademoiselle
put
me
on
is
that

lupin
shouting
with
laughter

long
he
replaced
the
instrument
went
into
the
lobby
and
into
the
bedroom
made
sure
that
the
secretary
and
the
manservant
had
not
unloosed
their
bonds
and
on
the
other
hand
that
they
were
in
no
danger
of
being
choked
by
their
gags
then
he
returned
to
his
chief
prisoner
he
wore
a
determined
and
relentless
look
we
finished

barbareux

a
voice

with
intensity

he
calmed
himself
suddenly
laid
his
hand
on
kesselbach
shoulder
and
harshly
one
word
only
yes
or
no
no
he
drew
a
magnificent
gold
watch
from
kesselbach
fob
and
placed
it
on
the
prisoner
knees
he
unbuttoned
kesselbach
waistcoat
opened
his
shirt
uncovered
his
chest
and
taking
a
steel
dagger
with
a
handle
that
lay
on
the
table
beside
him
he
put
the
point
of
it
against
the
place
where
the
pulsations
of
the
heart
made
the
bare
flesh
throb
for
the
last
time
no
kesselbach
it
is
eight
minutes
to
three
if
you
do
answer
within
eight
minutes
from
now
you
are
a
dead
man
the
next
morning
sergeant
gourel
walked
into
the
palace
hotel
punctually
at
the
appointed
hour
without
stopping
scorning
to
take
the
lift
he
went
up
the
stairs
on
the
fourth
floor
he
turned
to
the
right
followed
the
passage
and
rang
at
the
door
of
hearing
no
sound
he
rang
again
after
fruitless
attempts
he
went
to
the
floor
office
he
found
a
there
kesselbach
did
not
sleep
here
last
night
we
have
not
seen
him
since
yesterday
afternoon
but
his
servant
his
secretary
we
have
not
seen
them
either
then
they
also
did
not
sleep
in
the
hotel
i
suppose
not
you
suppose
not
but
you
ought
to
be
certain
why
kesselbach
is
not
staying
in
the
hotel
he
is
at
home
here
in
his
private
flat
he
is
not
waited
on
by
us
but
by
his
own
man
and
we
know
nothing
of
what
happens
inside
that
true
that
true
gourel
seemed
greatly
perplexed
he
had
come
with
positive
orders
a
precise
mission
within
the
limits
of
which
his
mind
was
able
to
exert
itself
outside
those
limits
he
did
not
quite
know
how
to
act
if
the
chief
were
here
he
muttered
if
the
chief
were
here
he
showed
his
card
and
stated
his
quality
then
he
said
on
the
so
you
have
not
seen
them
come
in
no
but
you
saw
them
go
out
no
i
ca
say
i
did
in
that
case
how
do
you
know
that
they
went
out
from
a
gentleman
who
called
yesterday
afternoon
a
gentleman
with
a
dark
mustache
yes
i
met
him
as
he
was
going
away
about
three
he
said
people
in
have
gone
out
kesselbach
will
stay
at
versailles
at
the
reservoirs
you
can
send
his
letters
on
to
him
there
but
who
was
this
gentleman
by
what
right
did
he
speak
i
do
know
gourel
felt
uneasy
it
all
struck
him
as
rather
queer
have
you
the
key
no
kesselbach
had
special
keys
made
let
go
and
look
gourel
rang
again
furiously
nothing
happened
he
was
about
to
go
when
suddenly
he
bent
down
and
clapped
his
ear
to
the
keyhole
listen
i
seem
to
hear
why
yes
it
quite
distinct
i
hear
moans
he
gave
the
door
a
tremendous
blow
with
his
fist
but
sir
you
have
not
the
right
oh
hang
the
right
he
struck
the
door
with
renewed
force
but
to
so
little
purpose
that
he
abandoned
the
attempt
forthwith
quick
quick
a
locksmith
one
of
the
waiters
started
off
at
a
run
gourel
blustering
and
undecided
walked
to
and
fro
the
servants
from
the
other
floors
collected
in
groups
people
from
the
office
from
the
department
arrived
gourel
cried
but
why
should
we
go
in
though
the
adjoining
rooms
do
they
communicate
with
this
suite
yes
but
the
communicating
doors
are
always
bolted
on
both
sides
then
i
shall
telephone
to
the
said
gourel
to
whose
mind
obviously
there
existed
no
salvation
without
his
chief
and
to
the
commissary
of
police
observed
some
one
yes
if
you
like
he
replied
in
the
tone
of
a
gentleman
who
took
little
or
no
interest
in
that
formality
when
he
returned
from
the
telephone
the
locksmith
had
nearly
finished
trying
the
keys
the
last
worked
the
lock
gourel
walked
briskly
in
he
at
once
hastened
in
the
direction
from
which
the
moans
came
and
hit
against
the
bodies
of
chapman
the
secretary
and
edwards
the
manservant
one
of
them
chapman
had
succeeded
by
dint
of
patience
in
loosening
his
gag
a
little
and
was
uttering
short
stifled
moans
the
other
seemed
asleep
they
were
released
but
gourel
was
anxious
where
mr
kesselbach
he
went
into
the
kesselbach
was
sitting
strapped
to
the
back
of
the
near
the
table
his
head
hung
on
his
chest
he
has
fainted
said
gourel
going
up
to
him
he
must
have
exerted
himself
beyond
his
strength
swiftly
he
cut
the
cords
that
fastened
the
shoulders
the
body
fell
forward
in
an
inert
mass
gourel
caught
it
in
his
arms
and
started
back
with
a
cry
of
horror
why
he
dead
feel
his
hands
are
and
look
at
his
eyes
some
one
ventured
the
opinion
an
apoplectic
stroke
no
doubt
or
else
true
there
no
sign
of
a
wound
it
a
natural
death
they
laid
the
body
on
the
sofa
and
unfastened
the
clothes
but
red
stains
at
once
appeared
on
the
white
shirt
and
when
they
pushed
it
back
they
saw
that
near
the
heart
the
chest
bore
a
little
scratch
through
which
had
trickled
a
thin
stream
of
blood
and
on
the
shirt
was
pinned
a
card
gourel
bent
forward
it
was
arsène
lupin
card
bloodstained
like
the
rest
then
gourel
drew
himself
up
authoritatively
and
sharply
murdered
arsène
lupin
leave
the
flat
leave
the
flat
all
of
you
no
one
must
stay
here
or
in
the
bedroom
let
the
two
men
be
removed
and
seen
to
elsewhere
leave
the
flat
and
do
touch
a
thing
chief
is
on
his
way
chapter
ii
the
label
arsène
lupin
gourel
repeated
these
two
fateful
words
with
an
absolutely
petrified
air
they
rang
within
him
like
a
knell
arsène
lupin
the
great
the
formidable
arsène
lupin
the
the
mighty
adventurer
was
it
possible
no
no
he
muttered
it
not
possible
he
only
that
was
just
it
was
he
really
dead
arsène
lupin
standing
beside
the
corpse
he
remained
dull
and
stunned
turning
the
card
over
and
over
with
a
certain
dread
as
though
he
had
been
challenged
by
a
ghost
arsène
lupin
what
ought
he
to
do
act
take
the
field
with
his
resources
no
no
better
not
act
he
was
bound
to
make
mistakes
if
he
entered
the
lists
with
an
adversary
of
that
stamp
besides
the
chief
was
on
his
way
chief
was
on
his
way
all
gourel
intellectual
philosophy
was
summed
up
in
that
short
sentence
an
able
persevering
officer
full
of
courage
and
experience
and
endowed
with
herculean
strength
he
was
one
of
those
who
go
ahead
only
when
obeying
directions
and
who
do
good
work
only
when
ordered
and
this
lack
of
initiative
had
become
still
more
marked
since
lenormand
had
taken
the
place
of
dudouis
in
the
lenormand
was
a
chief
indeed
with
him
one
was
sure
of
being
on
the
right
track
so
sure
even
that
gourel
stopped
the
moment
that
the
chief
incentive
was
no
longer
behind
him
but
the
chief
was
on
his
way
gourel
took
out
his
watch
and
calculated
the
exact
time
when
he
would
arrive
if
only
the
commissary
of
police
did
not
get
there
first
if
only
the
who
was
no
doubt
already
appointed
or
the
divisional
surgeon
did
not
come
to
make
inopportune
discoveries
before
the
chief
had
time
to
fix
the
essential
points
of
the
case
in
his
mind
well
gourel
what
are
you
dreaming
about
the
chief
lenormand
was
still
a
young
man
if
you
took
stock
only
of
the
expression
of
his
face
and
his
eyes
gleaming
through
his
spectacles
but
he
was
almost
an
old
man
when
you
saw
his
bent
back
his
skin
dry
and
yellow
as
wax
his
grizzled
hair
and
beard
his
whole
decrepit
hesitating
unhealthy
appearance
he
had
spent
his
life
laboriously
in
the
colonies
as
government
commissary
in
the
most
dangerous
posts
he
had
there
acquired
a
series
of
fevers
an
indomitable
energy
notwithstanding
his
physical
weariness
the
habit
of
living
alone
of
talking
little
and
acting
in
silence
a
certain
misanthropy
and
suddenly
at
the
age
of
in
consequence
of
the
famous
case
of
the
three
spaniards
at
biskra
a
great
and
notoriety
the
injustice
was
then
repaired
and
he
was
straightway
transferred
to
bordeaux
was
next
appointed
deputy
in
paris
and
lastly
on
the
death
of
dudouis
chief
of
the
and
in
each
of
these
posts
he
displayed
such
a
curious
faculty
of
inventiveness
in
his
proceedings
such
resourcefulness
so
many
new
and
original
qualities
and
above
all
he
achieved
such
correct
results
in
the
conduct
of
the
last
four
or
five
cases
with
which
public
opinion
had
been
stirred
that
his
name
was
quoted
in
the
same
breath
with
those
of
the
most
celebrated
detectives
gourel
for
his
part
had
no
hesitation
himself
a
favourite
of
the
chief
who
liked
him
for
his
frankness
and
his
passive
obedience
he
set
the
chief
above
them
all
the
chief
to
him
was
an
idol
an
infallible
god
lenormand
seemed
more
tired
than
usual
that
day
he
sat
down
wearily
parted
the
tails
of
his
an
old
famous
for
its
antiquated
cut
and
its
hue
untied
his
neckerchief
an
equally
famous
neckerchief
rested
his
two
hands
on
his
stick
and
said
speak
gourel
told
all
that
he
had
seen
and
all
that
he
had
learnt
and
told
it
briefly
according
to
the
habit
which
the
chief
had
taught
him
but
when
he
produced
lupin
card
lenormand
gave
a
start
lupin
yes
lupin
the
brute
bobbed
up
again
that
all
right
that
all
right
said
lenormand
after
a
moment
thought
that
all
right
of
course
said
gourel
who
loved
to
add
a
word
of
his
own
to
the
rare
speeches
of
a
superior
whose
only
fault
in
his
eyes
was
an
undue
reticence
that
all
right
for
at
last
you
will
measure
your
strength
with
an
adversary
worthy
of
you
and
lupin
will
meet
his
master
lupin
will
cease
to
exist
lupin
ferret
said
lenormand
cutting
him
short
it
was
like
an
order
given
by
a
sportsman
to
his
dog
and
gourel
ferreted
after
the
manner
of
a
good
dog
a
lively
and
intelligent
animal
working
under
his
master
eyes
lenormand
pointed
his
stick
to
a
corner
to
an
easy
chair
just
as
one
points
to
a
bush
or
a
tuft
of
grass
and
gourel
beat
up
the
bush
or
the
tuft
of
grass
with
conscientious
thoroughness
nothing
said
the
sergeant
when
he
finished
nothing
for
you
grunted
lenormand
that
what
i
meant
to
say
i
know
that
for
you
chief
there
are
things
that
talk
like
human
beings
real
living
witnesses
for
all
that
here
is
a
murder
well
and
duly
added
to
our
score
against
master
lupin
the
first
observed
lenormand
the
first
yes
but
it
was
bound
to
come
you
ca
lead
that
sort
of
life
without
sooner
or
later
being
driven
by
circumstances
to
serious
crime
kesselbach
must
have
defended
himself
no
because
he
was
bound
that
true
owned
gourel
somewhat
disconcertedly
and
it
rather
curious
too
why
kill
an
adversary
who
has
practically
ceased
to
exist
but
no
matter
if
i
had
collared
him
yesterday
when
we
were
face
to
face
at
the
lenormand
had
stepped
out
on
the
balcony
then
he
went
to
kesselbach
bedroom
on
the
right
and
tried
the
fastenings
of
the
windows
and
doors
the
windows
of
both
rooms
were
shut
when
i
came
in
said
gourel
shut
or
just
pushed
to
no
one
has
touched
them
since
and
they
are
shut
chief
a
sound
of
voices
brought
them
back
to
the
here
they
found
the
divisional
surgeon
engaged
in
examining
the
body
and
formerie
the
magistrate
formerie
exclaimed
arsène
lupin
i
am
glad
that
at
last
a
lucky
chance
has
brought
me
into
touch
with
that
scoundrel
again
i
show
the
fellow
the
stuff
i
made
of
and
this
time
it
a
murder
it
a
fight
between
you
and
me
now
master
lupin
formerie
had
not
forgotten
the
strange
adventure
of
the
princesse
de
lamballe
diadem
nor
the
wonderful
way
in
which
lupin
had
tricked
him
a
few
years
before
the
thing
had
remained
famous
in
the
annals
of
the
people
still
laughed
at
it
and
in
formerie
it
had
left
a
just
feeling
of
resentment
combined
with
the
longing
for
a
striking
revenge
footnote
see
by
edgar
jepson
and
maurice
leblanc
doubleday
page
the
nature
of
the
crime
is
he
declared
with
a
great
air
of
conviction
and
we
shall
have
no
difficulty
in
discovering
the
motive
so
all
is
well
lenormand
how
do
you
do
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
formerie
was
not
in
the
least
delighted
on
the
contrary
lenormand
presence
did
not
please
him
at
all
seeing
that
the
chief
detective
hardly
took
the
trouble
to
disguise
the
contempt
in
which
he
held
him
however
the
magistrate
drew
himself
up
and
in
his
most
solemn
tones
so
doctor
you
consider
that
death
took
place
about
a
dozen
hours
ago
perhaps
more
that
in
fact
was
my
own
idea
we
are
quite
agreed
and
the
instrument
of
the
crime
a
knife
with
a
very
thin
blade
monsieur
le
juge
replied
the
surgeon
look
the
blade
has
been
wiped
on
the
dead
own
handkerchief
just
so
just
so
you
can
see
the
mark
and
now
let
us
go
and
question
kesselbach
secretary
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
their
examination
will
throw
some
more
light
on
the
case
chapman
who
together
with
edwards
had
been
moved
to
his
own
room
on
the
left
of
the
had
already
recovered
from
his
experiences
he
described
in
detail
the
events
of
the
previous
day
kesselbach
restlessness
the
expected
visit
of
the
colonel
and
lastly
the
attack
of
which
they
had
been
the
victims
aha
cried
formerie
so
there
an
accomplice
and
you
heard
his
name
marco
you
say
this
is
very
important
when
we
got
the
accomplice
we
shall
be
a
good
deal
further
advanced
yes
but
we
not
got
him
lenormand
ventured
to
remark
we
shall
see
one
thing
at
a
time
and
then
chapman
this
marco
went
away
immediately
after
gourel
had
rung
the
bell
yes
we
heard
him
go
and
after
he
went
did
you
hear
nothing
else
yes
from
time
to
time
but
vaguely
the
door
was
shut
and
what
sort
of
noises
did
you
hear
bursts
of
voices
the
man
call
him
by
his
name
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
must
have
telephoned
capital
we
will
examine
the
person
of
the
hotel
who
has
charge
of
the
branch
exchange
communicating
with
the
outside
and
afterward
did
you
hear
him
go
out
too
he
came
in
to
see
if
we
were
still
bound
and
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
he
went
away
closing
the
after
him
yes
as
soon
as
his
crime
was
committed
good
good
it
all
fits
in
and
after
that
after
that
we
heard
nothing
more
the
night
passed
i
fell
asleep
from
exhaustion
so
did
edwards
and
it
was
not
until
this
morning
yes
i
know
there
it
not
going
badly
it
all
fits
in
and
marking
off
the
stages
of
his
investigation
in
a
tone
as
though
he
were
enumerating
so
many
victories
over
the
stranger
he
muttered
thoughtfully
the
accomplice
the
telephone
the
time
of
the
murder
the
sounds
that
were
heard
good
very
good
we
have
still
to
establish
the
motive
of
the
crime
in
this
case
as
we
have
lupin
to
deal
with
the
motive
is
obvious
lenormand
have
you
noticed
the
least
sign
of
anything
being
broken
open
no
then
the
robbery
must
have
been
effected
upon
the
person
of
the
victim
himself
has
his
been
found
i
left
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
said
gourel
they
all
went
into
the
where
formerie
discovered
that
the
contained
nothing
but
and
papers
establishing
the
murdered
man
identity
that
odd
chapman
can
you
tell
us
if
kesselbach
had
any
money
on
him
yes
on
the
previous
day
that
is
on
monday
the
day
before
yesterday
we
went
to
the
crédit
lyonnais
where
kesselbach
hired
a
safe
a
safe
at
the
crédit
lyonnais
good
we
must
look
into
that
and
before
we
left
kesselbach
opened
an
account
and
drew
out
five
or
six
thousand
francs
in
excellent
that
tells
us
just
what
we
want
to
know
chapman
continued
there
is
another
point
monsieur
le
juge
kesselbach
who
for
some
days
had
been
very
uneasy
in
his
mind
i
have
told
you
the
reason
a
scheme
to
which
he
attached
the
utmost
importance
kesselbach
seemed
particularly
anxious
about
two
things
there
was
first
a
little
ebony
box
which
he
put
away
safely
at
the
crédit
lyonnais
and
next
a
little
black
morocco
in
which
he
kept
a
few
papers
and
where
is
that
before
lupin
arrival
he
put
it
in
my
presence
into
that
formerie
took
the
bag
and
felt
about
in
it
the
was
not
there
he
rubbed
his
hands
ah
everything
fits
in
we
know
the
culprit
the
conditions
and
the
motive
of
the
crime
this
case
wo
take
long
are
we
quite
agreed
upon
everything
m
lenormand
upon
not
one
single
thing
there
was
a
moment
of
stupefaction
the
commissary
of
police
had
arrived
and
behind
him
in
spite
of
the
constables
keeping
the
door
a
troop
of
journalists
and
the
hotel
staff
had
forced
their
way
in
and
were
standing
in
the
notorious
though
the
old
fellow
was
for
his
bluntness
a
bluntness
which
was
not
without
a
certain
discourtesy
and
which
had
already
procured
him
an
occasional
reprimand
in
high
quarters
the
abruptness
of
this
reply
took
every
one
aback
and
formerie
in
particular
appeared
utterly
nonplussed
still
he
said
i
can
see
nothing
that
is
quite
simple
lupin
is
the
thief
why
did
he
commit
the
murder
lenormand
flung
at
him
in
order
to
commit
the
theft
i
beg
your
pardon
the
witnesses
story
proves
that
the
theft
took
place
before
the
murder
kesselbach
was
first
bound
and
gagged
then
robbed
why
should
lupin
who
has
never
resorted
to
murder
choose
this
time
to
kill
a
man
whom
he
had
rendered
helpless
and
whom
he
had
already
robbed
the
stroked
his
long
fair
whiskers
with
the
gesture
customary
to
him
when
a
question
seemed
incapable
of
solution
he
replied
in
a
thoughtful
tone
there
are
several
answers
to
that
what
are
they
it
depends
it
depends
upon
a
number
of
facts
as
yet
unknown
and
moreover
the
objection
applies
only
to
the
nature
of
the
motives
we
are
agreed
as
to
the
remainder
no
this
time
again
the
denial
was
flat
blunt
almost
impolite
so
much
so
that
the
magistrate
was
absolutely
nonplussed
dared
not
even
raise
a
protest
and
remained
abashed
in
the
presence
of
this
strange
collaborator
at
last
he
said
we
all
have
our
theories
i
should
like
to
know
yours
i
have
none
the
chief
detective
rose
and
leaning
on
his
stick
took
a
few
steps
through
the
room
all
the
people
around
him
were
silent
and
it
was
rather
curious
in
a
group
in
which
after
all
his
position
was
only
that
of
an
auxiliary
a
subordinate
to
see
this
ailing
decrepit
elderly
man
dominate
the
others
by
the
sheer
force
of
an
authority
which
they
had
to
feel
even
though
they
did
not
accept
it
after
a
long
pause
he
said
i
should
like
to
inspect
the
rooms
which
adjoin
this
suite
the
manager
showed
him
the
plan
of
the
hotel
the
only
way
out
of
the
bedroom
which
was
kesselbach
was
through
the
little
of
the
suite
but
the
bedroom
on
the
left
the
room
occupied
by
the
secretary
communicated
with
another
apartment
let
us
inspect
it
said
lenormand
formerie
could
not
help
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
growling
but
the
communicating
door
is
bolted
and
the
window
locked
let
us
inspect
it
repeated
lenormand
he
was
taken
into
the
apartment
which
was
the
first
of
the
five
rooms
reserved
for
kesselbach
then
at
his
request
he
was
taken
to
the
rooms
leading
out
of
it
all
the
communicating
doors
were
bolted
on
both
sides
are
not
any
of
these
rooms
occupied
he
asked
no
where
are
the
keys
the
keys
are
always
kept
in
the
office
then
no
one
can
have
got
in
no
one
except
the
who
airs
and
dusts
the
rooms
send
for
him
please
the
man
whose
name
was
gustave
beudot
replied
that
he
had
closed
the
windows
of
five
rooms
on
the
previous
day
in
accordance
with
his
general
instructions
at
what
time
at
six
in
the
evening
and
you
noticed
nothing
no
sir
and
this
morning
this
morning
i
opened
the
windows
at
eight
exactly
and
you
found
nothing
he
hesitated
he
was
pressed
with
questions
and
ended
by
admitting
well
i
picked
up
a
near
the
fireplace
in
i
intended
to
take
it
to
the
office
this
evening
have
you
it
on
you
no
it
is
in
my
room
it
is
a
case
it
has
a
space
for
tobacco
and
on
one
side
and
for
matches
on
the
other
there
are
two
initials
in
gold
an
l
and
an
what
that
chapman
had
stepped
forward
he
seemed
greatly
surprised
and
questioning
the
servant
a
you
say
yes
with
three
compartments
for
tobacco
and
matches
russian
tobacco
was
it
very
fine
and
light
yes
go
and
fetch
it
i
should
like
to
see
it
for
myself
to
make
sure
at
a
sign
from
the
chief
detective
gustave
beudot
left
the
room
lenormand
sat
down
and
his
keen
eyes
examined
the
carpet
the
furniture
and
the
curtains
he
asked
this
is
room
is
it
not
yes
the
magistrate
grinned
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
what
connection
you
establish
between
this
incident
and
the
tragedy
five
locked
doors
separate
us
from
the
room
in
which
kesselbach
was
murdered
lenormand
did
not
condescend
to
reply
time
passed
gustave
did
not
return
where
does
he
sleep
asked
the
chief
detective
on
the
sixth
floor
answered
the
manager
the
room
is
on
the
rue
de
judée
side
above
this
therefore
it
curious
that
he
not
back
yet
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
send
some
one
to
see
the
manager
went
himself
accompanied
by
chapman
a
few
minutes
after
he
returned
alone
running
with
every
mark
of
consternation
on
his
face
well
dead
murdered
yes
oh
by
thunder
how
clever
these
scoundrels
are
roared
lenormand
off
with
you
gourel
and
have
the
doors
of
the
hotel
locked
watch
every
outlet
and
you
mr
manager
please
take
us
to
gustave
beudot
room
the
manager
led
the
way
but
as
they
left
the
room
lenormand
stooped
and
picked
up
a
tiny
little
round
piece
of
paper
on
which
his
eyes
had
already
fixed
themselves
it
was
a
label
surrounded
with
a
blue
border
and
marked
with
the
number
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
on
chance
and
joined
the
others
a
small
wound
in
the
back
between
the
exactly
the
same
wound
as
kesselbach
declared
the
doctor
yes
said
lenormand
it
was
the
same
hand
that
struck
the
blow
and
the
same
weapon
was
used
judging
by
the
position
of
the
body
the
man
had
been
surprised
when
on
his
knees
before
the
bed
feeling
under
the
mattress
for
the
which
he
had
hidden
there
his
arm
was
still
caught
between
the
mattress
and
the
bed
but
the
was
not
to
be
found
that
must
have
been
devilish
compromising
timidly
suggested
formerie
who
no
longer
dared
put
forward
any
definite
opinion
well
of
course
said
the
chief
detective
at
any
rate
we
know
the
initials
an
l
and
an
and
with
that
together
with
what
chapman
appears
to
know
we
shall
easily
learn
lenormand
gave
a
start
chapman
but
where
is
he
they
looked
in
the
passage
among
the
groups
of
people
crowded
together
chapman
was
not
there
chapman
came
with
me
said
the
manager
yes
yes
i
know
but
he
did
not
come
back
with
you
no
i
left
him
with
the
corpse
you
left
him
alone
i
said
to
him
here
do
move
and
was
there
no
one
about
did
you
see
no
one
in
the
passage
no
but
in
the
other
attics
or
else
look
here
round
that
corner
was
there
no
one
hiding
there
lenormand
seemed
greatly
excited
he
walked
up
and
down
he
opened
the
doors
of
the
rooms
and
suddenly
he
set
off
at
a
run
with
an
agility
of
which
no
one
would
have
thought
him
capable
he
rattled
down
the
six
storeys
followed
at
a
distance
by
the
manager
and
the
at
the
bottom
he
found
gourel
in
front
of
the
main
door
has
no
one
gone
out
no
chief
what
about
the
other
door
in
the
rue
orvieto
i
have
posted
dieuzy
there
with
firm
orders
yes
chief
the
huge
hall
of
the
hotel
was
crowded
with
anxious
visitors
all
commenting
on
the
more
or
less
accurate
versions
that
had
reached
them
of
the
crime
all
the
servants
had
been
summoned
by
telephone
and
were
arriving
one
by
one
lenormand
questioned
them
without
delay
none
of
them
was
able
to
supply
the
least
information
but
a
chambermaid
appeared
ten
minutes
earlier
or
thereabouts
she
had
passed
two
gentlemen
who
were
coming
down
the
servants
staircase
between
the
fifth
and
the
fourth
floors
they
came
down
very
fast
the
one
in
front
was
holding
the
other
by
the
hand
i
was
surprised
to
see
those
two
gentlemen
on
the
staircase
would
you
know
them
again
not
the
first
one
he
had
his
head
turned
the
other
way
he
was
a
thin
fair
man
he
wore
a
soft
black
hat
and
black
clothes
and
the
other
oh
the
other
was
an
englishman
with
a
big
face
and
a
check
suit
he
had
no
hat
on
the
description
obviously
referred
to
chapman
the
woman
added
he
looked
he
looked
quite
funny
as
if
he
was
mad
gourel
word
was
not
enough
for
lenormand
one
after
the
other
he
questioned
the
standing
at
the
two
doors
did
you
know
mr
chapman
yes
sir
he
always
spoke
to
us
and
you
have
not
seen
him
go
out
no
sir
he
has
not
been
out
this
morning
lenormand
turned
to
the
commissary
of
police
how
many
men
have
you
with
you
monsieur
le
commissaire
four
that
not
sufficient
telephone
to
your
secretary
to
send
you
all
the
men
available
and
please
be
so
good
as
yourself
to
organize
the
closest
watch
at
every
outlet
the
state
of
siege
monsieur
le
commissaire
but
i
say
protested
the
manager
my
customers
i
do
care
a
hang
sir
for
your
customers
my
duty
comes
before
everything
and
my
duty
is
at
all
costs
to
arrest
so
you
believe
the
ventured
to
interpolate
i
do
monsieur
i
am
sure
that
the
perpetrator
of
both
the
murders
is
still
in
the
hotel
but
then
chapman
at
this
moment
i
can
not
guarantee
that
chapman
is
still
alive
in
any
case
it
is
only
a
question
of
minutes
of
seconds
gourel
take
two
men
and
search
all
the
rooms
on
the
fourth
floor
mr
manager
send
one
of
your
clerks
with
them
as
for
the
other
floors
i
shall
proceed
as
soon
as
we
are
reënforced
come
gourel
off
with
you
and
keep
your
eyes
open
it
big
game
you
hunting
gourel
and
his
men
hurried
away
lenormand
himself
remained
in
the
hall
near
the
office
this
time
he
did
not
think
of
sitting
down
as
his
custom
was
he
walked
from
the
main
entrance
to
the
door
in
the
rue
orvieto
and
returned
to
the
point
from
which
he
had
started
at
intervals
he
gave
instructions
mr
manager
see
that
the
kitchens
are
watched
they
may
try
to
escape
that
way
mr
manager
instruct
your
young
lady
at
the
telephone
not
to
put
any
of
the
people
in
the
hotel
into
communication
with
outside
subscribers
if
a
call
comes
from
the
outside
she
can
connect
the
caller
with
the
person
asked
for
but
she
must
take
a
note
of
that
person
name
mr
manager
have
a
list
made
out
of
all
your
visitors
whose
name
begins
with
an
l
or
an
the
tension
caught
the
spectators
by
the
throat
as
they
stood
clustered
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
silent
and
gasping
for
breath
shaking
with
fear
at
the
least
sound
obsessed
by
the
infernal
image
of
the
murderer
where
was
he
hiding
would
he
show
himself
was
he
not
one
of
themselves
this
one
perhaps
or
that
one
and
all
eyes
were
turned
on
the
gentleman
in
spectacles
an
and
a
neckerchief
who
was
walking
about
with
his
bent
back
on
a
pair
of
shaky
legs
at
times
one
of
the
waiters
accompanying
sergeant
gourel
on
his
search
would
come
running
up
any
news
asked
lenormand
no
sir
we
found
nothing
the
manager
made
two
attempts
to
induce
him
to
relax
his
orders
regarding
the
doors
the
situation
was
becoming
intolerable
the
office
was
filled
with
visitors
who
had
business
outside
or
who
had
arranged
to
leave
paris
i
do
care
a
hang
said
lenormand
again
but
i
know
them
all
i
congratulate
you
you
are
exceeding
your
powers
i
know
the
law
will
decide
against
you
i
convinced
of
that
monsieur
le
juge
himself
formerie
had
better
not
interfere
he
can
mind
his
own
business
which
is
to
examine
the
servants
as
he
is
doing
now
besides
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
it
has
to
do
with
the
police
it
my
affair
just
then
a
squad
of
police
burst
into
the
hotel
the
chief
detective
divided
them
into
several
sections
which
he
sent
up
to
the
third
floor
then
addressing
the
commissary
of
police
my
dear
commissary
i
leave
the
task
of
watching
the
doors
to
you
no
weakness
i
entreat
you
i
will
take
the
responsibility
for
anything
that
happens
and
turning
to
the
lift
he
had
himself
conveyed
to
the
second
floor
it
was
a
difficult
business
and
a
long
one
for
they
had
to
open
the
doors
of
the
sixty
bedrooms
to
inspect
all
the
bathrooms
all
the
recesses
all
the
cupboards
every
nook
and
corner
and
it
was
also
fruitless
an
hour
later
on
the
stroke
of
twelve
lenormand
had
just
done
the
second
floor
the
other
parties
had
not
yet
finished
the
upper
floors
and
no
discovery
had
been
made
lenormand
hesitated
had
the
murderer
retreated
to
the
attics
he
was
deciding
however
to
go
downstairs
when
he
was
told
that
kesselbach
had
just
arrived
with
her
edwards
the
old
confidential
had
accepted
the
task
of
informing
her
of
kesselbach
death
lenormand
found
her
in
one
of
the
drawing
rooms
overcome
by
the
unexpected
shock
but
with
her
features
wrung
with
grief
and
her
body
trembling
all
over
as
though
convulsed
with
fever
she
was
a
rather
tall
dark
woman
and
her
black
and
exceedingly
beautiful
eyes
were
filled
with
gold
with
little
gold
spots
like
spangles
gleaming
in
the
dark
her
husband
had
met
her
in
holland
where
dolores
was
born
of
an
old
family
of
spanish
origin
the
amontis
he
fell
in
love
with
her
at
first
sight
and
for
four
years
the
harmony
between
them
built
up
of
mutual
affection
and
devotion
had
never
been
interrupted
lenormand
introduced
himself
she
looked
at
him
without
replying
and
he
was
silent
for
she
did
not
appear
in
her
stupor
to
understand
what
he
said
then
suddenly
she
began
to
shed
copious
tears
and
asked
to
be
taken
to
her
husband
in
the
hall
lenormand
found
gourel
who
was
looking
for
him
and
who
rushed
at
him
with
a
hat
which
he
held
in
his
hand
i
picked
this
up
chief
there
no
doubt
whom
it
belongs
to
is
there
it
was
a
soft
black
felt
hat
and
resembled
the
description
given
there
was
no
lining
or
label
inside
it
where
did
you
pick
it
up
on
the
landing
of
the
servants
staircase
nothing
on
the
other
floors
nothing
we
searched
everywhere
there
is
only
the
first
floor
left
and
this
hat
shows
that
the
man
went
down
so
far
we
burning
chief
i
think
so
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
lenormand
stopped
go
back
to
the
commissary
and
give
him
my
orders
he
must
post
two
men
at
the
foot
of
each
of
the
four
staircases
revolver
in
hand
and
they
are
to
fire
if
necessary
understand
this
gourel
if
chapman
is
not
saved
and
if
the
fellow
escapes
it
means
my
resignation
i
been
for
over
two
hours
he
went
up
the
stairs
on
the
first
floor
he
met
two
policemen
leaving
a
bedroom
accompanied
by
a
servant
of
the
hotel
the
passage
was
deserted
the
hotel
staff
dared
not
venture
into
it
some
of
the
permanent
visitors
had
locked
themselves
in
their
rooms
and
the
police
had
to
knock
for
a
long
time
and
proclaim
who
they
were
before
they
could
get
the
doors
opened
farther
on
lenormand
saw
another
group
of
policemen
searching
the
maid
pantry
and
at
the
end
of
a
long
passage
he
saw
some
more
men
who
were
approaching
the
turning
that
is
to
say
that
part
of
the
passage
which
contained
the
rooms
overlooking
the
rue
de
judée
and
suddenly
he
heard
these
men
shouting
and
they
disappeared
at
a
run
he
hurried
after
them
the
policemen
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
passage
at
their
feet
blocking
their
way
with
its
face
on
the
carpet
lay
a
corpse
lenormand
bent
down
and
took
the
lifeless
head
in
his
hands
chapman
he
muttered
he
is
dead
he
examined
the
body
a
white
knitted
silk
muffler
was
tied
round
the
neck
he
undid
it
red
stains
appeared
and
he
saw
that
the
muffler
held
a
thick
wad
of
in
position
against
the
nape
of
the
neck
the
wad
was
soaked
with
blood
once
again
there
was
the
same
little
wound
clean
frank
and
pitiless
formerie
and
the
commissary
were
at
once
told
and
came
hastening
up
no
one
gone
out
asked
the
chief
detective
no
surprise
no
said
the
commissary
there
are
two
men
on
guard
at
the
foot
of
each
staircase
perhaps
he
has
gone
up
again
said
formerie
no
no
but
some
one
must
have
met
him
no
this
all
happened
quite
a
long
time
ago
the
hands
are
cold
the
murder
must
have
been
committed
almost
immediately
after
the
other
as
soon
as
the
two
men
came
here
by
the
staircase
but
the
body
would
have
been
seen
think
fifty
people
must
have
passed
this
spot
during
the
last
two
hours
the
body
was
not
here
then
where
was
it
why
how
can
i
tell
snapped
the
chief
detective
do
as
i
doing
look
for
yourself
you
ca
find
things
by
talking
he
furiously
patted
the
knob
of
his
stick
with
a
twitching
hand
and
he
stood
there
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
body
silent
and
thoughtful
at
last
he
spoke
monsieur
le
commissaire
be
so
good
as
to
have
the
victim
taken
to
an
empty
room
let
them
fetch
the
doctor
mr
manager
would
you
mind
opening
the
doors
of
all
the
rooms
on
this
passage
for
me
on
the
left
were
three
bedrooms
and
two
forming
an
empty
suite
which
lenormand
inspected
on
the
right
were
four
bedrooms
two
were
occupied
respectively
by
a
reverdat
and
an
italian
baron
giacomini
who
were
both
then
out
in
the
third
room
they
found
an
elderly
english
maiden
lady
still
in
bed
and
in
the
fourth
an
englishman
who
was
placidly
reading
and
smoking
and
who
had
not
been
in
the
least
disturbed
by
the
noises
in
the
passage
his
name
was
major
parbury
no
amount
of
searching
or
questioning
led
to
any
result
the
old
maid
had
heard
nothing
before
the
exclamations
of
the
policeman
no
noise
of
a
struggle
no
cry
of
pain
no
sound
of
quarreling
and
major
parbury
neither
moreover
there
was
no
suspicious
clue
found
no
trace
of
blood
nothing
to
lead
them
to
suppose
that
the
unfortunate
chapman
had
been
in
one
of
those
rooms
it
queer
muttered
the
it
all
very
queer
and
he
confessed
ingenuously
i
feel
more
and
more
at
sea
there
is
a
whole
series
of
circumstances
that
are
partly
beyond
me
what
do
you
make
of
it
m
lenormand
lenormand
was
on
the
point
of
letting
off
one
of
those
pointed
rejoinders
in
which
he
was
wont
to
give
vent
to
his
chronic
when
gourel
appeared
upon
the
scene
all
out
of
breath
chief
he
panted
they
found
this
downstairs
in
the
office
on
a
chair
it
was
a
parcel
of
moderate
dimensions
wrapped
up
in
a
piece
of
black
serge
did
they
open
it
asked
the
chief
yes
but
when
they
saw
what
the
parcel
contained
they
did
it
up
again
exactly
as
it
was
fastened
very
tight
as
you
can
see
untie
it
gourel
removed
the
wrapper
and
disclosed
a
black
diagonal
jacket
and
trousers
which
had
evidently
been
packed
up
in
a
hurry
as
the
creases
in
the
cloth
showed
in
the
middle
was
a
towel
covered
with
blood
which
had
been
dipped
in
water
in
order
no
doubt
to
destroy
the
marks
of
the
hands
that
had
been
wiped
on
it
inside
the
napkin
was
a
steel
dagger
with
a
handle
encrusted
with
gold
this
also
was
red
with
blood
the
blood
of
three
men
stabbed
within
the
space
of
a
few
hours
by
an
invisible
hand
amid
the
crowd
of
three
hundred
people
moving
about
in
the
huge
hotel
edwards
the
at
once
identified
the
dagger
as
belonging
to
kesselbach
he
had
seen
it
on
the
table
on
the
previous
day
before
the
assault
committed
by
lupin
mr
manager
said
the
chief
detective
the
restriction
is
over
gourel
go
and
give
orders
to
leave
the
doors
free
so
you
think
that
lupin
has
succeeded
in
getting
out
asked
formerie
no
the
perpetrator
of
the
three
murders
which
we
have
discovered
is
in
one
of
the
rooms
of
the
hotel
or
rather
he
is
among
the
visitors
in
the
hall
or
in
the
in
my
opinion
he
was
staying
in
the
hotel
impossible
besides
where
would
he
have
changed
his
clothes
and
what
clothes
would
he
have
on
now
i
do
know
but
i
am
stating
a
fact
and
you
are
letting
him
go
why
he
just
walk
out
quietly
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
one
who
walks
away
like
that
without
his
luggage
and
who
does
not
return
will
be
the
criminal
mr
manager
please
come
with
me
to
the
office
i
should
like
to
make
a
close
inspection
of
your
book
in
the
office
lenormand
found
a
few
letters
addressed
to
kesselbach
he
handed
them
to
the
there
was
also
a
parcel
that
had
just
come
by
the
paris
the
paper
in
which
it
was
packed
was
partly
torn
and
lenormand
saw
that
it
held
a
small
ebony
box
engraved
with
the
name
of
rudolf
kesselbach
feeling
curious
he
opened
the
parcel
the
box
contained
the
fragments
of
a
which
had
evidently
been
fixed
to
the
inside
of
the
lid
it
also
contained
the
card
of
arsène
lupin
but
one
detail
seemed
to
strike
the
chief
detective
on
the
outside
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
was
a
little
label
similar
to
the
label
which
he
had
picked
up
in
the
room
on
the
fourth
floor
where
the
was
found
and
this
label
bore
the
same
number

went
out
and
a
few
seconds
later
announced
the
chief
of
the
there
were
three
men
in
the
prime
minister
private
room
on
the
place
beauvau
the
famous
valenglay
leader
of
the
radical
party
for
the
past
thirty
years
and
now
president
of
the
council
and
minister
of
the
interior
the
testard
and
the
prefect
of

the
prefect
of

and
the
did
not
rise
from
the
chairs
which
they
had
occupied
during
their
long
conversation
with
the
prime
minister
valenglay
however
stood
up
and
pressing
the
chief
detective
hand
said
in
the
most
cordial
tones
i
have
no
doubt
my
dear
lenormand
that
you
know
the
reason
why
i
asked
you
to
come
the
kesselbach
case
yes
the
kesselbach
case
not
one
of
us
but
is
able
to
recall
not
only
the
main
details
of
this
tragic
affair
the
tangled
skein
of
which
i
have
set
myself
to
unravel
but
even
its
very
smallest
incidents
so
greatly
did
the
tragedy
excite
us
all
during
these
recent
years
nor
is
there
one
of
us
but
remembers
the
extraordinary
stir
which
it
created
both
in
and
outside
france
and
yet
there
was
one
thing
that
upset
the
public
even
more
than
the
three
murders
committed
in
such
mysterious
circumstances
more
than
the
detestable
atrocity
of
that
butchery
more
than
anything
else
and
that
was
the
reappearance
one
might
almost
say
the
resurrection
of
arsène
lupin
arsène
lupin
no
one
had
heard
speak
of
him
for
over
four
years
since
his
incredible
his
astounding
adventure
of
the
hollow
needle
since
the
day
when
he
had
slunk
away
into
the
darkness
before
the
eyes
of
holmlock
shears
and
isidore
beautrelet
carrying
on
his
back
the
dead
body
of
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
followed
by
his
old
servant

translated

and
published
by
doubleday
page
from
that
day
onward
he
had
been
generally
believed
to
be
dead
this
was
the
version
put
about
by
the
police
who
finding
no
trace
of
their
adversary
were
content
purely
and
simply
to
bury
him
some
however
believing
him
to
be
saved
described
him
as
leading
a
placid
philistine
existence
according
to
them
he
was
living
with
his
wife
and
children
growing
his
small
potatoes
whereas
others
maintained
that
bent
down
with
the
weight
of
sorrow
and
weary
of
the
vanities
of
this
world
he
had
sought
the
seclusion
of
a
trappist
monastery
and
here
he
was
once
more
looming
large
in
the
public
view
and
resuming
his
relentless
struggle
against
society
arsène
lupin
was
arsène
lupin
again
the
fanciful
intangible
disconcerting
audacious
genial
arsène
lupin
but
this
time
a
cry
of
horror
arose
arsène
lupin
had
taken
human
life
and
the
fierceness
the
cruelty
the
ruthless
cynicism
of
the
crime
were
so
great
that
then
and
there
the
legend
of
the
popular
hero
of
the
chivalrous
and
occasionally
sentimental
adventurer
made
way
for
a
new
conception
of
an
inhuman
bloodthirsty
and
ferocious
monster
the
crowd
now
loathed
and
feared
its
former
idol
with
more
intensity
than
it
had
once
shown
in
admiring
him
for
his
easy
grace
and
his
diverting
and
forthwith
the
indignation
of
that
frightened
crowd
turned
against
the
police
formerly
people
had
laughed
they
forgave
the
beaten
commissary
of
police
for
the
comical
fashion
in
which
he
allowed
himself
to
be
beaten
but
the
joke
had
lasted
too
long
and
in
a
burst
of
revolt
and
fury
they
now
called
the
authorities
to
account
for
the
unspeakable
crimes
which
these
were
powerless
to
prevent
in
the
press
at
public
meetings
in
the
streets
and
even
in
the
tribune
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
there
was
such
an
explosion
of
wrath
that
the
government
grew
alarmed
and
strove
by
every
possible
means
to
allay
the
public
excitement
it
so
happened
that
valenglay
the
premier
took
a
great
interest
in
all
these
police
questions
and
had
often
amused
himself
by
going
closely
into
different
cases
with
the
chief
of
the
whose
good
qualities
and
independent
character
he
valued
highly
he
sent
for
the
prefect
and
the
to
see
him
in
his
room
talked
to
them
and
then
sent
for
lenormand
yes
my
dear
lenormand
it
about
the
kesselbach
case
but
before
we
discuss
it
i
must
call
your
attention
to
a
point
which
more
particularly
affects
and
i
may
say
annoys
monsieur
le
préfet
de
police
delaume
will
you
explain
to
lenormand
oh
lenormand
knows
quite
well
how
the
matter
stands
said
the
prefect
in
a
tone
which
showed
but
little
toward
his
subordinate
we
have
talked
it
over
already
and
i
have
told
him
what
i
thought
of
his
improper
conduct
at
the
palace
hotel
people
are
generally
indignant
lenormand
rose
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
and
laid
it
on
the
table
what
is
this
asked
valenglay
my
resignation
monsieur
le
président
du
conseil
valenglay
gave
a
jump
what
your
resignation
for
a
remark
which
monsieur
le
préfet
thinks
fit
to
address
to
you
and
to
which
for
that
matter
he
attaches
no
importance
whatever
do
you
delaume
no
importance
whatever
and
there
you
go
taking
offence
you
must
confess
my
dear
lenormand
that
you
devilish
touchy
come
put
that
bit
of
paper
back
in
your
pocket
and
let
talk
seriously
the
chief
detective
sat
down
again
and
valenglay
silencing
the
prefect
who
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
dissatisfaction
said
in
two
words
lenormand
the
thing
is
that
lupin
reappearance
upon
the
scene
annoys
us
the
brute
has
defied
us
long
enough
it
used
to
be
funny
i
confess
and
i
for
my
part
was
the
first
to
laugh
at
it
but
it
no
longer
a
question
of
that
it
a
question
of
murder
now
we
could
stand
lupin
as
long
as
he
amused
the
gallery
but
when
he
takes
to
killing
people
no
then
what
is
it
that
you
ask
monsieur
le
président
what
we
ask
oh
it
quite
simple
first
his
arrest
and
then
his
head
i
can
promise
you
his
arrest
some
day
or
another
but
not
his
head
what
if
he
arrested
it
means
trial
for
murder
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
the
scaffold
no
and
why
not
because
lupin
has
not
committed
murder
eh
why
you
mad
lenormand
the
corpses
at
the
palace
hotel
are
so
many
inventions
i
suppose
and
the
three
murders
were
never
committed
yes
but
not
by
lupin
the
chief
spoke
these
words
very
steadily
with
impressive
calmness
and
conviction
the
attorney
and
the
prefect
protested
i
presume
lenormand
said
valenglay
that
you
do
not
put
forward
that
theory
without
serious
reasons
it
is
not
a
theory
what
proof
have
you
there
are
two
to
begin
with
two
proofs
of
a
moral
nature
which
i
at
once
placed
before
monsieur
le
juge
and
which
the
newspapers
have
laid
stress
upon
first
and
foremost
lupin
does
not
kill
people
next
why
should
he
have
killed
anybody
seeing
that
the
object
which
he
set
out
to
achieve
the
theft
was
accomplished
and
that
he
had
nothing
to
fear
from
an
adversary
who
was
gagged
and
bound
very
well
but
the
facts
facts
are
worth
nothing
against
reason
and
logic
and
moreover
the
facts
also
are
on
my
side
what
would
be
the
meaning
of
lupin
presence
in
the
room
in
which
the
was
discovered
on
the
other
hand
the
black
clothes
which
were
found
and
which
evidently
belonged
to
the
murderer
are
not
in
the
least
of
a
size
to
fit
lupin
you
know
him
then
do
you
i
no
but
edwards
saw
him
gourel
saw
him
and
the
man
whom
they
saw
is
not
the
man
whom
the
chambermaid
saw
on
the
servants
staircase
dragging
chapman
by
the
hand
then
your
idea
you
mean
to
say
the
truth
le
président
here
it
is
or
at
least
here
is
the
truth
as
far
as
i
know
it
on
tuesday
the
of
april
a
man
broke
into
kesselbach
room
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
lenormand
was
interrupted
by
a
burst
of
laughter
it
came
from
the
prefect
of
police
let
me
tell
you
lenormand
that
you
are
in
rather
too
great
a
hurry
to
state
your
precise
facts
it
has
been
shown
that
at
three
on
that
day
kesselbach
walked
into
the
crédit
lyonnais
and
went
down
to
the
safe
deposit
his
signature
in
the
register
proves
it
lenormand
waited
respectfully
until
his
superior
had
finished
speaking
then
without
even
troubling
to
reply
directly
to
the
attack
he
continued
at
about
two
in
the
afternoon
lupin
assisted
by
an
accomplice
a
man
named
marco
bound
kesselbach
hand
and
foot
robbed
him
of
all
the
loose
cash
which
he
had
upon
him
and
compelled
him
to
reveal
the
cypher
of
his
safe
at
the
crédit
lyonnais
as
soon
as
the
secret
was
told
marco
left
he
joined
another
accomplice
who
profiting
by
a
certain
resemblance
to
kesselbach
a
resemblance
which
he
accentuated
that
day
by
wearing
clothes
similar
to
kesselbach
and
putting
on
a
pair
of
gold
spectacles
entered
the
crédit
lyonnais
imitated
kesselbach
signature
emptied
the
safe
of
its
contents
and
walked
off
accompanied
by
marco
marco
at
once
telephoned
to
lupin
lupin
as
soon
as
he
was
sure
that
kesselbach
had
not
deceived
him
and
that
the
object
of
his
expedition
was
attained
went
away
valenglay
seemed
to
waver
in
his
mind
yes
yes
we
admit
that
but
what
surprises
me
is
that
a
man
like
lupin
should
have
risked
so
much
for
such
a
paltry
profit
a
few
and
the
hypothetical
contents
of
a
safe
lupin
was
after
more
than
that
he
wanted
either
the
morocco
envelope
which
was
in
the
or
else
the
ebony
box
which
was
in
the
safe
he
had
the
ebony
box
because
he
has
sent
it
back
empty
therefore
by
this
time
he
knows
or
is
in
a
fair
way
for
knowing
the
famous
scheme
which
kesselbach
was
planning
and
which
he
was
discussing
with
his
secretary
a
few
minutes
before
his
death
what
was
the
scheme
i
do
exactly
know
the
manager
of
barbareux
agency
to
whom
he
had
opened
his
mind
about
it
has
told
me
that
kesselbach
was
looking
for
a
man
who
went
by
the
name
of
pierre
leduc
a
man
who
had
lost
caste
it
appears
why
and
how
the
discovery
of
this
person
was
connected
with
the
success
of
his
scheme
i
am
unable
to
say
very
well
said
valenglay
so
much
for
arsène
lupin
his
part
is
played
kesselbach
is
bound
hand
and
foot
robbed
but
alive
what
happens
up
to
the
time
when
he
is
found
dead
nothing
for
several
hours
nothing
until
night
but
during
the
night
some
one
made
his
way
in
how
through
room
one
of
the
rooms
reserved
by
kesselbach
the
person
in
question
evidently
possessed
a
false
key
but
exclaimed
the
prefect
of
police
all
the
doors
between
that
room
and
kesselbach
flat
were
bolted
and
there
were
five
of
them
there
was
always
the
balcony
the
balcony
yes
the
balcony
runs
along
the
whole
floor
on
the
rue
de
judée
side
and
what
about
the
spaces
in
between
an
active
man
can
step
across
them
our
man
did
i
have
found
marks
but
all
the
windows
of
the
suite
were
shut
and
it
was
ascertained
after
the
crime
that
they
were
still
shut
all
except
one
the
secretary
window
chapman
which
was
only
pushed
to
i
tried
it
myself
this
time
the
prime
minister
seemed
a
little
shaken
so
logical
did
lenormand
version
seem
so
precise
and
supported
by
such
sound
facts
he
asked
with
growing
interest
but
what
was
the
man
object
in
coming
i
do
know
ah
you
do
know
any
more
than
i
know
his
name
but
why
did
he
kill
mr
kesselbach
i
do
know
this
all
remains
a
mystery
the
utmost
that
we
have
the
right
to
suppose
is
that
he
did
not
come
with
the
intention
of
killing
but
with
the
intention
he
too
of
taking
the
documents
contained
in
the
morocco
and
the
ebony
box
and
that
finding
himself
by
accident
in
the
presence
of
the
enemy
reduced
to
a
state
of
helplessness
he
killed
him
valenglay
muttered
yes
strictly
speaking
that
is
possible
and
according
to
you
did
he
find
the
documents
he
did
not
find
the
box
because
it
was
not
there
but
he
found
the
black
morocco
so
that
lupin
and
the
other
are
in
the
same
position
each
knows
as
much
as
the
other
about
the
kesselbach
scheme
that
means
remarked
the
premier
that
they
will
fight
exactly
and
the
fight
has
already
begun
the
murderer
finding
a
card
of
arsène
lupin
pinned
it
to
the
corpse
all
the
appearances
would
thus
be
against
arsène
lupin
therefore
arsène
lupin
would
be
the
murderer
true
true
said
valenglay
the
calculation
seemed
pretty
accurate
and
the
stratagem
would
have
succeeded
continued
lenormand
if
in
consequence
of
another
and
a
less
favorable
accident
the
murderer
had
not
either
in
coming
or
going
dropped
his
in
room
and
if
the
gustave
beudot
had
not
picked
it
up
from
that
moment
knowing
himself
to
be
discovered
or
on
the
point
of
being
discovered
how
did
he
know
it
how
why
through
formerie
the
himself
the
investigation
took
place
with
open
doors
it
is
certain
that
the
murderer
was
concealed
among
the
people
members
of
the
hotel
staff
and
journalists
who
were
present
when
gustave
beudot
was
giving
his
evidence
and
when
the
magistrate
sent
gustave
beudot
to
his
attic
to
fetch
the
the
man
followed
and
struck
the
blow
second
victim
no
one
protested
now
the
tragedy
was
being
reconstructed
before
their
eyes
with
a
realism
and
a
probable
accuracy
which
were
equally
striking
and
the
third
victim
asked
valenglay
he
himself
gave
the
ruffian
his
opportunity
when
beudot
did
not
return
chapman
curious
to
see
the
for
himself
went
upstairs
with
the
manager
of
the
hotel
he
was
surprised
by
the
murderer
dragged
away
by
him
taken
to
one
of
the
bedrooms
and
murdered
in
his
turn
but
why
did
he
allow
himself
to
be
dragged
away
like
that
and
to
be
led
by
a
man
whom
he
knew
to
be
the
murderer
of
kesselbach
and
of
gustave
beudot
i
do
know
any
more
than
i
know
the
room
in
which
the
crime
was
committed
or
the
really
miraculous
way
in
which
the
criminal
escaped
something
has
been
said
about
two
blue
labels
yes
one
was
found
on
the
box
which
lupin
sent
back
and
the
other
was
found
by
me
and
doubtless
came
from
the
morocco
stolen
by
the
murderer
well
i
do
think
that
they
mean
anything
what
does
mean
something
is
the
number
which
kesselbach
wrote
on
each
of
them
his
handwriting
has
been
recognized
and
that
number
it
a
mystery
then
i
can
only
reply
again
that
i
do
know
have
you
no
suspicions
none
at
all
two
of
my
men
are
occupying
one
of
the
rooms
in
the
palace
hotel
on
the
floor
where
chapman
body
was
found
i
have
had
all
the
people
in
the
hotel
watched
by
these
two
men
the
criminal
is
not
one
of
those
who
have
left
did
no
one
telephone
while
the
murders
were
being
committed
yes
some
one
telephoned
from
the
outside
to
major
parbury
one
of
the
four
persons
who
occupied
rooms
on
the
passage
and
this
major
parbury
i
am
having
him
watched
by
my
men
so
far
nothing
has
been
discovered
against
him
and
in
which
direction
do
you
intend
to
seek
oh
in
a
very
limited
direction
in
my
opinion
the
murderer
must
be
numbered
among
the
friends
or
connections
of
and
kesselbach
he
followed
their
scent
knew
their
habits
the
reason
of
presence
in
paris
and
he
at
least
suspected
the
importance
of
kesselbach
plans
then
he
was
not
a
professional
criminal
no
no
certainly
not
the
murder
was
committed
with
extraordinary
cleverness
and
daring
but
it
was
due
to
circumstances
i
repeat
we
shall
have
to
look
among
the
people
forming
the
immediate
circle
of
and
kesselbach
and
the
proof
is
that
kesselbach
murderer
killed
gustave
beudot
for
the
sole
reason
that
the
waiter
had
the
in
his
possession
and
chapman
for
the
sole
reason
that
the
secretary
knew
of
its
existence
remember
chapman
excitement
at
the
mere
description
of
the
chapman
received
a
sudden
insight
into
the
tragedy
if
he
had
seen
the
we
should
have
been
fully
informed
the
man
whoever
he
may
be
was
well
aware
of
that
and
he
put
an
end
to
chapman
and
we
know
nothing
nothing
but
the
initials
l
and
he
reflected
for
a
moment
and
said
there
is
another
proof
which
forms
an
answer
to
one
of
your
questions
monsieur
le
président
do
you
believe
that
chapman
would
have
accompanied
that
man
along
the
passages
and
staircases
of
the
hotel
if
he
did
not
already
know
him
the
facts
were
accumulating
the
truth
or
at
least
the
probable
truth
was
gaining
strength
many
of
the
points
at
issue
the
most
interesting
perhaps
remained
obscure
but
what
a
light
had
been
thrown
upon
the
subject
short
of
the
motives
that
inspired
them
how
clearly
lenormand
hearers
now
perceived
the
sequence
of
acts
performed
on
that
tragic
morning
there
was
a
pause
every
one
was
thinking
seeking
for
arguments
for
objections
at
last
valenglay
exclaimed
my
dear
lenormand
this
is
all
quite
excellent
you
have
convinced
me
but
taking
one
thing
with
another
we
are
no
further
than
we
were
what
do
you
mean
what
i
say
the
object
of
our
meeting
is
not
to
clear
up
a
portion
of
the
mystery
which
one
day
i
am
sure
you
will
clear
up
altogether
but
to
satisfy
the
public
demand
as
fully
as
we
possibly
can
now
whether
the
murderer
is
lupin
or
another
whether
there
are
two
criminals
or
three
or
only
one
all
this
gives
us
neither
the
criminal
name
nor
his
arrest
and
the
public
continues
under
the
disastrous
impression
that
the
law
is
powerless
what
can
i
do
give
the
public
the
definite
satisfaction
which
it
demands
but
it
seems
to
me
that
this
explanation
ought
to
be
enough
words
the
public
wants
deeds
one
thing
alone
will
satisfy
it
an
arrest
hang
it
all
hang
it
all
we
ca
arrest
the
first
person
that
comes
along
even
that
would
be
better
than
arresting
nobody
said
valenglay
with
a
laugh
come
have
a
good
look
round
are
you
sure
of
edwards
kesselbach
servant
absolutely
sure
besides
no
monsieur
le
président
it
would
be
dangerous
and
ridiculous
and
i
am
sure
that
himself
there
are
only
two
people
whom
we
have
the
right
to
arrest
the
murderer
i
do
know
who
he
is
and
arsène
lupin
well
there
is
no
question
of
arresting
arsène
lupin
or
at
least
it
requires
time
a
whole
series
of
measures
which
i
have
not
yet
had
the
leisure
to
contrive
because
i
looked
upon
lupin
as
settled
down
or
dead
valenglay
stamped
his
foot
with
the
impatience
of
a
man
who
likes
to
see
his
wishes
realized
on
the
spot
and
yet
and
yet
my
dear
lenormand
something
must
be
done
if
only
for
your
own
sake
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
you
have
powerful
enemies
and
that
if
i
were
not
there
in
short
lenormand
you
ca
be
allowed
to
get
out
of
it
like
this
what
are
you
doing
about
the
accomplices
there
are
others
besides
lupin
there
is
marco
and
there
the
rogue
who
impersonated
kesselbach
in
order
to
visit
the
cellars
of
the
crédit
lyonnais
would
you
be
satisfied
if
you
got
him
monsieur
le
président
would
i
be
satisfied
heavens
alive
i
should
think
i
would
well
give
me
seven
days
seven
days
why
it
not
a
question
of
days
my
dear
lenormand
it
a
question
of
hours
how
many
will
you
give
me
monsieur
le
président
valenglay
took
out
his
watch
and
chuckled
i
will
give
you
ten
minutes
my
dear
lenormand
the
chief
took
out
his
and
emphasizing
each
syllable
said
calmly
that
is
four
minutes
more
than
i
want
monsieur
le
président
valenglay
looked
at
him
in
amazement
four
minutes
more
than
you
want
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
monsieur
le
président
that
the
ten
minutes
which
you
allow
me
are
superfluous
i
want
six
and
not
one
minute
more
oh
but
look
here
lenormand
if
you
imagine
that
this
is
the
time
for
joking
the
chief
detective
went
to
the
window
and
beckoned
to
two
men
who
were
walking
round
the
courtyard
then
he
returned
would
you
have
the
kindness
to
sign
a
warrant
for
the
arrest
of
auguste
maximin
philippe
daileron
aged
you
might
leave
the
profession
open
he
went
to
the
door
come
in
gourel
you
too
dieuzy
gourel
entered
accompanied
by
inspector
dieuzy
have
you
the
handcuffs
gourel
yes
chief
lenormand
went
up
to
valenglay
monsieur
le
président
everything
is
ready
but
i
entreat
you
most
urgently
to
forego
this
arrest
it
upsets
all
my
plans
it
may
render
them
abortive
and
for
the
sake
of
what
after
all
is
a
very
trifling
satisfaction
it
exposes
us
to
the
risk
of
jeopardizing
the
whole
business
lenormand
let
me
remark
that
you
have
only
eighty
seconds
left
the
chief
suppressed
a
gesture
of
annoyance
strode
across
the
room
and
leaning
on
his
stick
sat
down
angrily
as
though
he
had
decided
not
to
speak
then
suddenly
making
up
his
mind
monsieur
le
président
the
first
person
who
enters
this
room
will
be
the
man
whose
arrest
you
asked
for
against
my
wish
as
i
insist
on
pointing
out
to
you
fifteen
seconds
lenormand
gourel
dieuzy
the
first
person
do
you
understand
attorney
have
you
signed
the
warrant
ten
seconds
lenormand
monsieur
le
président
would
you
be
so
good
as
to
ring
the
bell
valenglay
rang
the
messenger
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
waited
valenglay
turned
to
the
chief
well
lenormand
he
waiting
for
your
orders
whom
is
he
to
show
in
no
one
but
the
rogue
whose
arrest
you
promised
us
the
six
minutes
are
more
than
past
yes
but
the
rogue
is
here
here
i
do
understand
no
one
has
entered
the
room
i
beg
your
pardon
oh

one
has
entered
the
room
valenglay
started
eh
but
this
is
madness
what
you
mean
to
say
the
two
detectives
had
slipped
between
the
messenger
and
the
door
lenormand
walked
up
to
the
messenger
clapped
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
in
a
loud
voice
in
the
name
of
the
law
auguste
maximin
philippe
daileron
chief
messenger
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
i

out
laughing
oh

a
joke

a
joke
that
infernal
lenormand
of
all
the
notions
well
done
lenormand
it
long
since
i
enjoyed
so
good
a
laugh
lenormand
turned
to
the
attorney
you
wo
forget
to
fill
in
master
daileron
profession
on
the
warrant
will
you
chief
messenger
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
oh
good
oh
capital
chief
messenger
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
spluttered
valenglay
holding
his
sides
oh
this
wonderful
lenormand
gets
hold
of
ideas
that
would
never
occur
to
anybody
else
the
public
is
clamoring
for
an
arrest
whoosh
he
flings
at
its
head
my
chief
messenger
auguste
the
model
servant
well
lenormand
my
dear
fellow
i
knew
you
had
a
certain
gift
of
imagination
but
i
never
suspected
that
it
would
go
so
far
as
this
the
impertinence
of
it
from
the
commencement
of
this
scene
auguste
had
not
stirred
a
limb
and
seemed
to
understand
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
his
face
the
typical
face
of
a
good
loyal
faithful
seemed
absolutely
bewildered
he
looked
at
the
gentlemen
turn
and
turn
about
with
a
visible
effort
to
catch
the
meaning
of
their
words
lenormand
said
a
few
words
to
gourel
who
went
out
then
going
up
to
auguste
and
speaking
with
great
decision
he
said
there
no
way
out
of
it
you
caught
the
best
thing
to
do
when
the
game
is
lost
is
to
throw
down
your
cards
what
were
you
doing
on
tuesday
i
nothing
i
was
here
you
lie
you
were
off
duty
you
went
out
for
the
day
oh
yes
i
remember
i
had
a
friend
to
see
me
from
the
country
we
went
for
a
walk
in
the
bois
your
friend
name
was
marco
and
you
went
for
a
walk
in
the
cellars
of
the
crédit
lyonnais
i
what
an
idea
marco
i
do
know
any
one
by
that
name
and
these
do
you
know
these
cried
the
chief
thrusting
a
pair
of
spectacles
under
his
nose
no
certainly
not
i
do
wear
spectacles
yes
you
do
you
wear
them
when
you
go
to
the
crédit
lyonnais
and
when
you
pass
yourself
off
as
kesselbach
these
come
from
your
room
the
room
which
you
occupy
under
the
name
of
jérôme
at
no
rue
du
colisee
my
room
room
i
sleep
here
at
the
office
but
you
change
your
clothes
over
there
to
play
your
parts
in
gang
a
blow
in
the
chest
made
him
stagger
back
auguste
reached
the
window
at
a
bound
climbed
over
the
balcony
and
jumped
into
the
courtyard
dash
it
all
shouted
valenglay
the
scoundrel
he
rang
the
bell
ran
to
the
window
wanted
to
call
out
lenormand
with
the
greatest
calm
said
do
excite
yourself
monsieur
le
président
but
that
blackguard
of
an
auguste
one
second
please
i
foresaw
this
ending
in
fact
i
allowed
for
it
it
the
best
confession
we
could
have
yielding
in
the
presence
of
this
coolness
valenglay
resumed
his
seat
in
a
moment
gourel
entered
with
his
hand
on
the
collar
of
master
auguste
maximin
philippe
daileron
jérôme
chief
messenger
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
bring
him
gourel
said
lenormand
as
who
should
say
fetch
it
bring
it
to
a
good
retriever
carrying
the
game
in
its
jaws
did
he
come
quietly
he
bit
me
a
little
but
i
held
tight
replied
the
sergeant
showing
his
huge
sinewy
hand
very
well
gourel
and
now
take
this
chap
off
to
the
dépôt
in
a
cab
for
the
present
m
jérôme
valenglay
was
immensely
amused
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
laughed
the
idea
that
his
chief
messenger
was
one
of
lupin
accomplices
struck
him
as
a
most
delightfully
ludicrous
thing
well
done
my
dear
lenormand
this
is
wonderful
but
how
on
earth
did
you
manage
it
oh
in
the
simplest
possible
fashion
i
knew
that
kesselbach
was
employing
the
barbareux
agency
and
that
lupin
had
called
on
him
pretending
to
come
from
the
agency
i
hunted
in
that
direction
and
discovered
that
when
the
indiscretion
was
committed
to
the
prejudice
of
kesselbach
and
of
barbareux
it
could
only
have
been
to
the
advantage
of
one
jérôme
a
friend
of
one
of
the
clerks
at
the
agency
if
you
had
not
ordered
me
to
hustle
things
i
should
have
watched
the
messenger
and
caught
marco
and
then
lupin
you
catch
them
lenormand
you
catch
them
i
assure
you
and
we
shall
be
assisting
at
the
most
exciting
spectacle
in
the
world
the
struggle
between
lupin
and
yourself
i
shall
bet
on
you
the
next
morning
the
newspapers
published
the
following
letter
letter
to
lenormand
chief
of
the
all
my
congratulations
dear
sir
and
dear
friend
on
your
arrest
of
jérôme
the
messenger
it
was
a
smart
piece
of
work
well
executed
and
worthy
of
you
all
my
compliments
also
on
the
ingenious
manner
in
which
you
proved
to
the
prime
minister
that
i
was
not
kesselbach
murderer
your
demonstration
was
clear
logical
irrefutable
and
what
is
more
truthful
as
you
know
i
do
not
kill
people
thank
you
for
proving
it
on
this
occasion
the
esteem
of
my
contemporaries
and
of
yourself
dear
sir
and
dear
friend
are
indispensable
to
my
happiness
in
return
allow
me
to
assist
you
in
the
pursuit
of
the
monstrous
assassin
and
to
give
you
a
hand
with
the
kesselbach
case
a
very
interesting
case
believe
me
so
interesting
and
so
worthy
of
my
attention
that
i
have
determined
to
issue
from
the
retirement
in
which
i
have
been
living
for
the
past
four
years
between
my
books
and
my
good
dog
sherlock
to
beat
all
my
comrades
to
arms
and
to
throw
myself
once
more
into
the
fray
what
unexpected
turns
life
sometimes
takes
here
am
i
your
let
me
assure
you
dear
sir
and
dear
friend
that
i
congratulate
myself
upon
it
and
that
i
appreciate
this
favor
of
destiny
at
its
true
value
arsène
lupin
one
word
more
of
which
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
approve
as
it
is
not
right
and
proper
that
a
gentleman
who
has
had
the
glorious
privilege
of
fighting
under
my
banner
should
languish
on
the
straw
of
your
prisons
i
feel
it
my
duty
to
give
you
fair
warning
that
in
five
weeks
time
on
friday
the
of
may
i
shall
set
at
liberty

promoted
by
me
to

acquainted
yes
the
girl
went
to
ask
kesselbach
for
a
subscription
for
her
school
they
must
have
taken
a
liking
to
each
other
for
during
the
past
four
days
they
have
been
walking
together
in
the
parc
de
villeneuve
of
which
the
garden
of
the
retreat

only
a
dependency

what
time

go
out
from
five
to
six
at
six

the
young
lady
goes

there

never
any
one
in
the
park
at
that
hour
very
well
i
shall
be
there
you
can
go
he
sent
him
out
through
the
door
leading
to
the
hall
and
returning
to
the
called
the
brothers
doudeville
two
young
men
entered
a
little
overdressed
and
good
morning
jean
good
morning
jacques
any
news
at
the
prefecture
nothing
much
governor
does
lenormand
continue
to
have
confidence
in
you
yes
next
to
gourel
we
are
his
favorite
inspectors
a
proof
is
that
he
has
posted
us
in
the
palace
hotel
to
watch
the
people
who
were
living
on
the
passage
at
the
time
of
chapman
murder
gourel
comes
every
morning
and
we
make
the
same
report
to
him
that
we
do
to
you
capital
it
is
essential
that
i
should
be
informed
of
all
that
happens
and
all
that
is
said
at
the
prefecture
of
police
as
long
as
lenormand
looks
upon
you
as
his
men
i
am
master
of
the
situation
and
have
you
discovered
a
trail
of
any
kind
in
the
hotel
jean
doudeville
the
elder
of
the
two
replied
the
englishwoman
who
occupied
one
of
the
bedrooms
has
gone
that
does
interest
me
i
know
all
about
her
but
her
neighbor
major
parbury
they
seemed
embarrassed
at
last
one
of
them
replied
major
parbury
this
morning
ordered
his
luggage
to
be
taken
to
the
gare
du
nord
for
the
train
and
himself
drove
away
in
a
motor
we
were
there
when
the
train
left
the
major
did
not
come
and
the
luggage
he
had
it
fetched
at
the
station
by
whom
by
a
commissionaire
so
we
were
told
then
his
tracks
are
lost
yes
at
last
cried
the
prince
joyfully
the
others
looked
at
him
in
surprise
why
of
course
he
said
that
a
clue
do
you
think
so
evidently
the
murder
of
chapman
can
only
have
been
committed
in
one
of
the
rooms
on
that
passage
kesselbach
murderer
took
the
secretary
there
to
an
accomplice
killed
him
there
changed
his
clothes
there
and
once
the
murderer
had
got
away
the
accomplice
placed
the
corpse
in
the
passage
but
which
accomplice
the
manner
of
major
disappearance
goes
to
show
that
he
knows
something
of
the
business
quick
telephone
the
good
news
to
lenormand
or
gourel
the
prefecture
must
be
informed
as
soon
as
possible
the
people
there
and
i
are
marching
hand
in
hand
he
gave
them
a
few
more
injunctions
concerning
their
double
rôle
as
in
the
service
of
prince
sernine
and
dismissed
them
two
visitors
remained
in
the
he
called
one
of
them
in
a
thousand
pardons
doctor
he
said
i
am
quite
at
your
orders
now
how
is
pierre
leduc
he
dead
aha
said
sernine
i
expected
it
after
your
note
of
this
morning
but
all
the
same
the
poor
beggar
has
not
been
long
he
was
wasted
to
a
shadow
a
and
it
was
all
over
did
he
not
speak
no
are
you
sure
that
from
the
day
when
the
two
of
us
picked
him
up
under
the
table
in
that
low
haunt
at
belleville
are
you
sure
that
nobody
in
your
suspected
that
he
was
the
pierre
leduc
whom
the
police
were
looking
for
the
mysterious
pierre
leduc
whom
kesselbach
was
trying
to
find
at
all
costs
nobody
he
had
a
room
to
himself
moreover
i
bandaged
up
his
left
hand
so
that
the
injury
to
the
little
finger
could
not
be
seen
as
for
the
scar
on
the
cheek
it
is
hidden
by
the
beard
and
you
looked
after
him
yourself
myself
and
according
to
your
instructions
i
took
the
opportunity
of
questioning
him
whenever
he
seemed
at
all
clear
in
his
head
but
i
could
never
get
more
than
an
inarticulate
stammering
out
of
him
the
prince
muttered
thoughtfully
dead
so
pierre
leduc
is
dead
the
whole
kesselbach
case
obviously
turned
on
him
and
now
he
disappears
without
a
revelation
without
a
word
about
himself
about
his
past
ought
i
to
embark
on
this
adventure
in
which
i
am
still
entirely
in
the
dark
it
dangerous
i
may
come
to
grief
he
reflected
for
a
moment
and
exclaimed
oh
who
cares
i
shall
go
on
for
all
that
it
no
reason
because
pierre
leduc
is
dead
that
i
should
throw
up
the
game
on
the
contrary
and
the
opportunity
is
too
tempting
pierre
leduc
is
dead
long
live
pierre
leduc
go
doctor
go
home
i
shall
ring
you
up
before
dinner
the
doctor
went
out
now
then
philippe
said
sernine
to
his
last
remaining
visitor
a
little
man
dressed
like
a
waiter
at
a
hotel
a
very
hotel
however
you
will
remember
governor
philippe
began
that
last
week
you
made
me
go
as
boots
to
the
hôtel
des
at
versailles
to
keep
my
eye
on
a
young
man
yes
i
know
gérard
baupré
how
do
things
stand
with
him
he
at
the
end
of
his
resources
still
full
of
gloomy
ideas
yes
he
wants
to
kill
himself
is
he
serious
quite
i
found
this
little
note
in
pencil
among
his
papers
ah
said
sernine
reading
the
note
he
announces
his
suicide
and
for
this
evening
too
yes
governor
he
has
bought
the
rope
and
screwed
the
hook
to
the
ceiling
thereupon
acting
on
your
instructions
i
talked
to
him
he
told
me
of
his
distress
and
i
advised
him
to
apply
to
you
sernine
is
rich
i
said
is
generous
perhaps
he
will
help
you
all
this
is
so
he
is
coming
he
is
here
how
do
you
know
i
followed
him
he
took
the
train
to
paris
and
he
is
walking
up
and
down
the
boulevard
at
this
minute
he
will
make
up
his
mind
from
one
moment
to
the
other
just
then
the
servant
brought
in
a
card
the
prince
glanced
at
it
and
said
to
the
man
show
gérard
baupré
in
then
turning
to
philippe
you
go
into
the
here
listen
and
do
stir
left
alone
the
prince
muttered
why
should
i
hesitate
it
fate
that
sends
him
my
way
a
few
minutes
later
a
tall
young
man
entered
he
was
fair
and
slender
with
an
emaciated
face
and
feverish
eyes
and
he
stood
on
the
threshold
embarrassed
hesitating
in
the
attitude
of
a
beggar
who
would
like
to
put
out
his
hand
for
alms
and
dares
not
the
conversation
was
brief
are
you
gérard
baupré
yes
yes
that
is
my
name
i
have
not
the
honor
it
like
this
sir
some
one
told
me
who
a
hotel
servant
who
said
he
had
been
in
your
service
please
come
to
the
point
well
the
young
man
stopped
taken
aback
and
frightened
by
the
haughty
attitude
adopted
by
the
prince
who
exclaimed
but
sir
there
must
be
some
well
sir
the
man
told
me
that
you
were
very
rich
and
very
generous
and
i
thought
that
you
might
possibly
he
broke
off
short
incapable
of
uttering
the
word
of
prayer
and
humiliation
sernine
went
up
to
him
gérard
baupré
did
you
not
publish
a
volume
of
poetry
called
smile
of
yes
yes
cried
the
young
man
his
face
lighting
up
have
you
read
it
yes
very
pretty
your
poems
very
pretty
only
do
you
reckon
upon
being
able
to
live
on
what
they
will
bring
you
certainly
sooner
or
later
sooner
or
later
later
rather
than
sooner
i
expect
and
meantime
you
have
come
to
ask
me
for
the
wherewithal
to
live
for
the
wherewithal
to
buy
food
sir
sernine
put
his
hand
on
the
young
man
shoulder
and
coldly
poets
do
not
need
food
monsieur
they
live
on
rhymes
and
dreams
do
as
they
do
that
is
better
than
begging
for
bread
the
young
man
quivered
under
the
insult
he
turned
to
the
door
without
a
word
sernine
stopped
him
one
thing
more
monsieur
have
you
no
resources
of
any
kind
none
at
all
and
you
are
not
reckoning
on
anything
i
have
one
hope
left
i
have
written
to
one
of
my
relations
imploring
him
to
send
me
something
i
shall
have
his
answer
it
is
my
last
chance
and
if
you
have
no
answer
you
have
doubtless
made
up
your
mind
this
very
evening
to
yes
sir
this
was
said
quite
plainly
and
simply
sernine
burst
out
laughing
bless
my
soul
what
a
queer
young
man
you
are
and
full
of
artless
conviction
too
come
and
see
me
again
next
year
will
you
we
will
talk
about
all
this
it
so
curious
so
interesting
and
above
all
so
funny
ha
ha
ha
ha
and
shaking
with
laughter
with
affected
bows
and
gestures
he
showed
him
the
door
philippe
he
said
admitting
the
did
you
hear
yes
governor
gérard
baupré
is
expecting
a
telegram
this
afternoon
a
promise
of
assistance
yes
it
his
last
hope
he
must
not
receive
that
telegram
if
it
comes
intercept
it
and
tear
it
up
very
well
governor
are
you
alone
at
your
hotel
yes
with
the
cook
who
does
not
sleep
in
the
boss
is
away
good
so
we
are
the
masters
till
this
evening
at
eleven
be
off
prince
sernine
went
to
his
room
and
rang
for
his
servant
my
hat
gloves
and
stick
is
the
car
there
yes
sir
he
dressed
went
out
and
sank
into
a
large
comfortable
limousine
which
took
him
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
to
the
marquis
and
marquise
de
gastyne
where
he
was
engaged
for
lunch
at
two
he
took
leave
of
his
hosts
stopped
in
the
avenue
kléber
picked
up
two
of
his
friends
and
a
doctor
and
at
five
minutes
to
three
arrived
at
the
parc
des
princes
at
three
he
fought
a
sword
duel
with
the
italian
major
spinelli
cut
his
adversary
ear
in
the
first
bout
and
at
a
quarter
to
four
took
a
bank
at
the
rue
cambon
club
from
which
he
retired
at
twenty
minutes
past
five
after
winning
thousand
francs
and
all
this
without
hurrying
with
a
sort
of
haughty
indifference
as
though
the
feverish
activity
that
sent
his
life
whizzing
through
a
whirl
of
tempestuous
deeds
and
events
were
the
ordinary
rule
of
his
most
peaceful
days
octave
he
said
to
his
chauffeur
go
to
garches
and
at
ten
minutes
to
six
he
alighted
outside
the
old
walls
of
the
parc
de
villeneuve
although
broken
up
nowadays
and
spoilt
the
villeneuve
estate
still
retains
something
of
the
splendor
which
it
knew
at
the
time
when
the
empress
eugénie
used
to
stay
there
with
its
old
trees
its
lake
and
the
leafy
horizon
of
the
woods
of
the
landscape
has
a
certain
melancholy
grace
an
important
part
of
the
estate
was
made
over
to
the
pasteur
institute
a
smaller
portion
separated
from
the
other
by
the
whole
extent
of
the
space
reserved
for
the
public
forms
a
property
contained
within
the
walls
which
is
still
fairly
large
and
which
comprises
the
house
of
retreat
with
four
isolated
standing
around
it
that
is
where
kesselbach
lives
said
the
prince
to
himself
catching
sight
of
the
roofs
of
the
house
and
the
four
in
the
distance
he
crossed
the
park
and
walked
toward
the
lake
suddenly
he
stopped
behind
a
clump
of
trees
he
had
seen
two
ladies
against
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
that
crossed
the
lake
varnier
and
his
men
must
be
somewhere
near
but
by
jove
they
are
keeping
jolly
well
hidden
i
ca
see
them
anywhere
the
two
ladies
were
now
strolling
across
the
lawns
under
the
tall
venerable
trees
the
blue
of
the
sky
appeared
between
the
branches
which
swayed
in
the
peaceful
breeze
and
the
scent
of
spring
and
of
young
vegetation
was
wafted
through
the
air
on
the
grassy
slopes
that
ran
down
to
the
motionless
water
daisies
violets
daffodils
lilies
of
the
valley
all
the
little
flowers
of
april
and
may
stood
grouped
and
here
and
there
formed
constellations
of
every
color
the
sun
was
sinking
on
the
horizon
and
all
at
once
three
men
started
from
a
thicket
of
bushes
and
made
for
the
two
ladies
they
accosted
them
a
few
words
were
exchanged
the
ladies
gave
visible
signs
of
dread
one
of
the
men
went
up
to
the
shorter
of
the
two
and
tried
to
snatch
the
gold
purse
which
she
was
carrying
in
her
hand
they
cried
out
and
the
three
men
flung
themselves
upon
them
now
or
never
said
the
prince
and
he
rushed
forward
in
ten
seconds
he
had
almost
reached
the
brink
of
the
water
at
his
approach
the
three
men
fled
run
away
you
vagabonds
he
chuckled
run
for
all
you
are
worth
here
the
rescuer
coming
and
he
set
out
in
pursuit
of
them
but
one
of
the
ladies
entreated
him
oh
sir
i
beg
of
you
my
friend
is
the
shorter
lady
had
fallen
on
the
grass
in
a
dead
faint
he
retraced
his
steps
and
anxiously
she
is
not
wounded
he
asked
did
those
scoundrels
no
no
it
only
the
fright
the
excitement
besides
you
will
understand
the
lady
is
kesselbach
oh
he
said
he
produced
a
bottle
of
which
the
younger
woman
at
once
applied
to
her
friend
nostrils
and
he
added
lift
the
amethyst
that
serves
as
a
stopper
you
will
see
a
little
box
containing
some
tabloids
give
madame
one
of
them
one
no
more
they
are
very
strong
he
watched
the
young
woman
helping
her
friend
she
was
very
simply
dressed
and
her
face
was
gentle
and
grave
with
a
smile
that
lit
up
her
features
even
when
she
was
not
smiling
that
is
geneviève
he
thought
and
he
repeated
with
emotion
geneviève
geneviève
meanwhile
kesselbach
gradually
recovered
consciousness
she
was
astonished
at
first
seemed
not
to
understand
then
her
memory
returning
she
thanked
her
deliverer
with
a
movement
of
the
head
he
made
a
deep
bow
and
said
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
i
am
prince
sernine
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
i
do
not
know
how
to
express
my
gratitude
by
not
expressing
it
at
all
madame
you
must
thank
chance
the
chance
that
turned
my
steps
in
this
direction
may
i
offer
you
my
arm
a
few
minutes
later
kesselbach
rang
at
the
door
of
the
house
of
retreat
and
said
to
the
prince
i
will
ask
one
more
service
of
you
monsieur
do
not
speak
of
this
assault
and
yet
madame
it
would
be
the
only
way
of
finding
out
any
attempt
to
find
out
would
mean
an
inquiry
and
that
would
involve
more
noise
and
fuss
about
me
examinations
fatigue
and
i
am
worn
out
as
it
is
the
prince
did
not
insist
bowing
to
her
he
asked
will
you
allow
me
to
call
and
ask
how
you
are
oh
certainly
she
kissed
geneviève
and
went
indoors
meantime
night
was
beginning
to
fall
sernine
would
not
let
geneviève
return
alone
but
they
had
hardly
entered
the
path
when
a
figure
standing
out
against
the
shadow
hastened
toward
them
grandmother
cried
geneviève
she
threw
herself
into
the
arms
of
an
old
woman
who
covered
her
with
kisses
oh
my
darling
my
darling
what
has
happened
how
late
you
are
and
you
are
always
so
punctual
geneviève
introduced
the
prince
prince
sernine
mme
ernemont
my
grandmother
then
she
related
the
incident
and
mme
ernemont
repeated
oh
my
darling
how
frightened
you
must
have
been
i
shall
never
forget
your
kindness
monsieur
i
assure
you
but
how
frightened
you
must
have
been
my
poor
darling
come
granny
calm
yourself
as
i
am
here
yes
but
the
fright
may
have
done
you
harm
one
never
knows
the
consequences
oh
it
horrible
they
went
along
a
hedge
through
which
a
yard
planted
with
trees
a
few
shrubs
a
playground
and
a
white
house
were
just
visible
behind
the
house
sheltered
by
a
clump
of
arranged
to
form
a
covered
walk
was
a
little
gate
the
old
lady
asked
prince
sernine
to
come
in
and
led
the
way
to
a
little
or
parlor
geneviève
asked
leave
to
withdraw
for
a
moment
to
go
and
see
her
pupils
whose
it
was
the
prince
and
mme
ernemont
remained
alone
the
old
lady
had
a
sad
and
a
pale
face
under
her
white
hair
which
ended
in
two
long
loose
curls
she
was
too
stout
her
walk
was
heavy
and
notwithstanding
her
appearance
and
her
dress
which
was
that
of
a
lady
she
had
something
a
little
vulgar
about
her
but
her
eyes
were
immensely
kind
prince
sernine
went
up
to
her
took
her
head
in
his
two
hands
and
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
well
old
one
and
how
are
you
she
stood
dumfounded
the
prince
kissed
her
again
laughing
she
spluttered
you
it
you
o
mother
of
god
o
mother
of
god
is
it
possible
o
mother
of
god
my
dear
old
victoire
do
call
me
that
she
cried
shuddering
victoire
is
dead
your
old
servant
no
longer
exists
i
belong
entirely
to
geneviève
and
lowering
her
voice
o
mother
of
god
i
saw
your
name
in
the
papers
then
it
true
that
you
have
taken
to
your
wicked
life
again

see

edgar
jepson
and
maurice
leblanc
and
hollow
by
maurice
leblanc
translated
by
alexander
teixeira
de
mattos
as
you
see
and
yet
you
swore
to
me
that
it
was
finished
that
you
were
going
away
for
good
that
you
wanted
to
become
an
honest
man
i
tried
i
have
been
trying
for
four
years
you
ca
say
that
i
have
got
myself
talked
about
during
those
four
years
well
well
it
bores
me
she
gave
a
sigh
and
asked
always
the
same
you
have
changed
oh
it
settled
you
never
will
change
so
you
are
in
the
kesselbach
case
why
of
course
but
for
that
would
i
have
taken
the
trouble
to
arrange
for
an
attack
on
kesselbach
at
six
so
that
i
might
have
the
opportunity
of
delivering
her
from
the
clutches
of
my
own
men
at
five
minutes
past
looking
upon
me
as
her
rescuer
she
is
obliged
to
receive
me
i
am
now
in
the
heart
of
the
citadel
and
while
protecting
the
widow
can
keep
a
lookout
all
round
ah
you
see
the
sort
of
life
which
i
lead
does
not
permit
me
to
lounge
about
and
waste
my
time
on
little
questions
of
politeness
and
such
outside
matters
i
have
to
go
straight
to
the
point
violently
brutally
dramatically
she
looked
at
him
in
dismay
and
gasped
i
see
i
see
it
all
lies
about
the
attack
but
then
geneviève
why
i
killing
two
birds
with
one
stone
it
was
as
easy
to
rescue
two
as
one
think
of
the
time
it
would
have
taken
the
efforts
useless
efforts
perhaps
to
worm
myself
into
that
child
friendship
what
was
i
to
her
what
should
i
be
now
an
unknown
person
a
stranger
whereas
now
i
am
the
rescuer
in
an
hour
i
shall
be
the
friend
she
began
to
tremble
so
so
you
did
not
rescue
geneviève
so
you
are
going
to
mix
us
up
in
your
affairs
and
suddenly
in
a
fit
of
rebellion
seizing
him
by
the
shoulders
no
i
wo
have
it
do
you
understand
you
brought
the
child
to
me
one
day
saying
i
entrust
her
to
you
her
father
and
mother
are
dead
take
her
under
your
protection
well
she
under
my
protection
now
and
i
shall
know
how
to
defend
her
against
you
and
all
your
manœuvers
standing
straight
upright
in
a
very
determined
attitude
mme
ernemont
seemed
ready
for
all
emergencies
slowly
and
deliberately
sernine
loosened
the
two
hands
one
after
the
other
that
held
him
and
in
his
turn
took
the
old
lady
by
the
shoulders
forced
her
into
an
stooped
over
and
in
a
very
calm
voice
said
rot
she
began
to
cry
and
clasping
her
hands
together
implored
him
i
beseech
you
leave
us
in
peace
we
were
so
happy
i
thought
that
you
had
forgotten
us
and
i
blessed
heaven
every
time
a
day
had
passed
why
yes
i
love
you
just
the
same
but
geneviève
you
see
there
nothing
that
i
would
do
for
that
child
she
has
taken
your
place
in
my
heart
so
i
perceive
said
he
laughing
you
would
send
me
to
the
devil
with
pleasure
come
enough
of
this
nonsense
i
have
no
time
to
waste
i
must
talk
to
geneviève
you
going
to
talk
to
her
well
is
that
a
crime
and
what
have
you
to
tell
her
a
secret
a
very
grave
secret
and
a
very
touching
one
the
old
lady
took
fright
and
one
that
will
cause
her
sorrow
perhaps
oh
i
fear
everything
i
fear
everything
where
she
concerned
she
is
coming
he
said
no
not
yet
yes
yes
i
hear
her
wipe
your
eyes
and
be
sensible
listen
said
she
eagerly
listen
i
do
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
what
secret
you
mean
to
reveal
to
this
child
whom
you
do
know
but
i
who
do
know
her
tell
you
this
geneviève
has
a
very
plucky
very
spirited
but
very
sensitive
nature
be
careful
how
you
choose
your
words
you
might
wound
feelings
the
existence
of
which
you
can
not
even
suspect
lord
bless
me
and
why
not
because
she
belongs
to
another
race
than
you
to
a
different
world
i
mean
a
different
moral
world
there
are
things
which
you
are
forbidden
to
understand
nowadays
between
you
and
her
the
obstacle
is
insurmountable
geneviève
has
the
most
unblemished
and
upright
conscience
and
you
and
i
and
you
are
not
an
honest
man
geneviève
entered
bright
and
charming
all
my
babies
have
gone
to
bed
i
have
ten
minutes
to
spare
why
grandmother
what
the
matter
you
look
quite
upset
is
it
still
that
business
with
the
no
mademoiselle
said
sernine
i
believe
i
have
had
the
good
fortune
to
reassure
your
grandmother
only
we
were
talking
of
you
of
your
childhood
and
that
is
a
subject
it
seems
which
your
grandmother
can
not
touch
upon
without
emotion
of
my
childhood
said
geneviève
reddening
oh
grandmother
do
scold
her
mademoiselle
the
conversation
turned
in
that
direction
by
accident
it
so
happens
that
i
have
often
passed
through
the
little
village
where
you
were
brought
up
aspremont
yes
aspremont
near
nice
you
used
to
live
in
a
new
house
white
all
over
yes
she
said
white
all
over
with
a
touch
of
blue
paint
round
the
windows
i
was
only
seven
years
old
when
i
left
aspremont
but
i
remember
the
least
things
of
that
period
and
i
have
not
forgotten
the
glare
of
the
sun
on
the
white
front
of
the
house
nor
the
shade
of
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
mademoiselle
was
a
field
of
and
under
one
of
those
stood
a
table
at
which
your
mother
used
to
work
on
hot
days
that
true
that
true
she
said
quite
excitedly
i
used
to
play
by
her
side
and
it
was
there
said
he
that
i
saw
your
mother
several
times
i
recognized
her
image
the
moment
i
set
eyes
on
you
but
it
was
a
brighter
happier
image
yes
my
poor
mother
was
not
happy
my
father
died
on
the
very
day
of
my
birth
and
nothing
was
ever
able
to
console
her
she
used
to
cry
a
great
deal
i
still
possess
a
little
handkerchief
with
which
i
used
to
dry
her
tears
at
that
time
a
little
handkerchief
with
a
pink
pattern
what
she
exclaimed
seized
with
surprise
you
know
i
was
there
one
day
when
you
were
comforting
her
and
you
comforted
her
so
prettily
that
the
scene
remained
impressed
on
my
memory
she
gave
him
a
penetrating
glance
and
murmured
almost
to
herself
yes
yes
i
seem
to
the
expression
of
your
eyes
and
then
the
sound
of
your
voice
she
lowered
her
eyelids
for
a
moment
and
reflected
as
if
she
were
vainly
trying
to
bring
back
a
recollection
that
escaped
her
and
she
continued
then
you
knew
her
i
had
some
friends
living
near
aspremont
and
used
to
meet
her
at
their
house
the
last
time
i
saw
her
she
seemed
to
me
sadder
still
paler
and
when
i
came
back
again
it
was
all
over
was
it
not
said
geneviève
yes
she
went
very
quickly
in
a
few
weeks
and
i
was
left
alone
with
neighbors
who
sat
up
with
her
and
one
morning
they
took
her
away
and
on
the
evening
of
that
day
some
one
came
while
i
was
asleep
and
lifted
me
up
and
wrapped
me
in
blankets
a
man
asked
the
prince
yes
a
man
he
talked
to
me
quite
low
very
gently
his
voice
did
me
good
and
as
he
carried
me
down
the
road
and
also
in
the
carriage
during
the
night
he
rocked
me
in
his
arms
and
told
me
stories
in
the
same
voice
in
the
same
voice
she
broke
off
gradually
and
looked
at
him
again
more
sharply
than
before
and
with
a
more
obvious
effort
to
seize
the
fleeting
impression
that
passed
over
her
at
moments
he
asked
and
then
where
did
he
take
you
i
ca
recollect
clearly
it
is
just
as
though
i
had
slept
for
several
days
i
can
remember
nothing
before
the
little
town
of
montégut
in
the
vendée
where
i
spent
the
second
half
of
my
childhood
with
father
and
mother
izereau
a
worthy
couple
who
reared
me
and
brought
me
up
and
whose
love
and
devotion
i
shall
never
forget
and
did
they
die
too
yes
she
said
of
an
epidemic
of
typhoid
fever
in
the
district
but
i
did
not
know
that
until
later
as
soon
as
they
fell
ill
i
was
carried
off
as
on
the
first
occasion
and
under
the
same
conditions
at
night
by
some
one
who
also
wrapped
me
up
in
blankets
only
i
was
bigger
i
struggled
i
tried
to
call
out
and
he
had
to
close
my
mouth
with
a
silk
handkerchief
how
old
were
you
then
fourteen
it
was
four
years
ago
then
you
were
able
to
see
what
the
man
was
like
no
he
hid
his
face
better
and
he
did
not
speak
a
single
word
to
me
nevertheless
i
have
always
believed
him
to
be
the
same
one
for
i
remember
the
same
solicitude
the
same
attentive
careful
movements
and
after
that
after
that
came
oblivion
sleep
as
before
this
time
i
was
ill
it
appears
i
was
feverish
and
i
woke
in
a
bright
cheerful
room
a
lady
was
bending
over
me
and
smiling
it
was
grandmother
and
the
room
was
the
one
in
which
i
now
sleep
upstairs
she
had
resumed
her
happy
face
her
sweet
radiant
expression
and
she
ended
with
a
smile
that
was
how
she
became
my
grandmother
and
how
after
a
few
trials
the
little
aspremont
girl
now
knows
the
delights
of
a
peaceful
life
and
teaches
grammar
and
arithmetic
to
little
girls
who
are
either
naughty
or
lazy
but
who
are
all
fond
of
her
she
spoke
cheerfully
in
a
tone
at
once
thoughtful
and
gay
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
possessed
a
reasonable
mind
sernine
listened
to
her
with
growing
surprise
and
without
trying
to
conceal
his
agitation
have
you
never
heard
speak
of
that
man
since
he
asked
never
and
would
you
be
glad
to
see
him
again
oh
very
glad
well
then
mademoiselle
geneviève
gave
a
start
you
know
something
the
truth
perhaps
no
no
only
he
rose
and
walked
up
and
down
the
room
from
time
to
time
his
eyes
fell
upon
geneviève
and
it
looked
as
though
he
were
on
the
point
of
giving
a
more
precise
answer
to
the
question
which
she
had
put
to
him
would
he
speak
mme
ernemont
awaited
with
anguish
the
revelation
of
the
secret
upon
which
the
girl
future
peace
might
depend
he
sat
down
beside
geneviève
appeared
to
hesitate
and
said
at
last
no
no
just
now
an
idea
occurred
to
me
a
recollection
a
recollection
and
i
was
mistaken
your
story
contained
certain
details
that
misled
me
are
you
sure
he
hesitated
and
then
declared
absolutely
sure
oh
said
she
greatly
disappointed
i
had
half
guessed
that
that
man
whom
i
saw
twice
that
you
knew
him
that
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
but
waited
for
an
answer
to
the
question
which
she
had
put
to
him
without
daring
to
state
it
completely
he
was
silent
then
insisting
no
further
she
bent
over
mme
ernemont
good
night
grandmother
my
children
must
be
in
bed
by
this
time
but
they
could
none
of
them
go
to
sleep
before
i
had
kissed
them
she
held
out
her
hand
to
the
prince
thank
you
once
more
are
you
going
he
asked
quickly
yes
if
you
will
excuse
me
grandmother
will
see
you
out
he
bowed
low
and
kissed
her
hand
as
she
opened
the
door
she
turned
round
and
smiled
then
she
disappeared
the
prince
listened
to
the
sound
of
her
footsteps
diminishing
in
the
distance
and
stood
his
face
white
with
emotion
well
said
the
old
lady
so
you
did
not
speak
no
that
secret
later
oddly
enough
i
was
not
able
to
was
it
so
difficult
did
not
she
herself
feel
that
you
were
the
stranger
who
took
her
away
twice
a
word
would
have
been
enough
later
later
he
repeated
recovering
all
his
assurance
you
can
understand
the
child
hardly
knows
me
i
must
first
gain
the
right
to
her
affection
to
her
love
when
i
have
given
her
the
life
which
she
deserves
a
wonderful
life
such
as
one
reads
of
in
then
i
will
speak
the
old
lady
tossed
her
head
i
fear
that
you
are
making
a
great
mistake
geneviève
does
not
want
a
wonderful
life
she
has
simple
tastes
she
has
the
tastes
of
all
women
and
wealth
luxury
and
power
give
joys
which
not
one
of
them
despises
yes
geneviève
does
and
you
would
do
much
better
we
shall
see
for
the
moment
let
me
go
my
own
way
and
be
quite
easy
i
have
not
the
least
intention
as
you
say
of
mixing
her
up
in
any
of
my
manœuvers
she
will
hardly
ever
see
me
only
we
had
to
come
into
contact
you
know
that
done
he
left
the
school
and
walked
to
where
his
was
waiting
for
him
he
was
perfectly
happy
she
is
charming
and
so
gentle
so
grave
her
mother
eyes
eyes
that
soften
you
heavens
how
long
ago
that
all
is
and
what
a
delightful
recollection
a
little
sad
but
so
delightful
and
he
said
aloud
certainly
i
shall
look
after
her
happiness
and
that
at
once
this
very
evening
that
it
this
very
evening
she
shall
have
a
sweetheart
is
not
love
the
essential
condition
of
any
young
happiness
he
found
his
car
on
the
home
he
said
to
octave
when
sernine
reached
home
he
rang
up
neuilly
and
telephoned
his
instructions
to
the
friend
whom
he
called
the
doctor

the
time

ten
minutes
later
the
car
stopped
at
the
end
of
the
boulevard
inkerman
outside
a
villa
standing
in
its
own
grounds
the
doctor
came
down
at
the
sound
of
the
hooter
the
prince
asked

fellow
ready
packed

for
let
get
him
on
board
they
carried
into
the
motor
a
sort
of
long
sack
shaped
like
a
human
being
and
apparently
rather
heavy
and
the
prince
said
go
to
versailles
octave
rue

hôtel

filthy
hotel

the
doctor

regular
hovel

tell
me
and
it
will
be
a
hard
piece
of
work
for
me
at
least
but
by
jove
i
would
sell
this
moment
for
a
fortune
who
dares
pretend
that
life
is
monotonous
they
reached
the
hôtel
des
a
muddy
alley
two
steps
down
and
they
entered
a
passage
lit
by
a
flickering
lamp
sernine
knocked
with
his
fist
against
a
little
door
a
waiter
appeared
philippe
the
man
to
whom
sernine
had
given
orders
that
morning

gérard
baupré

the

of
an
hour

poor
devil
will
take
a
leap
into
eternity
show
me
the
way
philippe
you
stay
here
doctor
the
waiter
took
the
candle
they
climbed
to
the
third
floor
and
walking
on
went
along
a
low
and
corridor
lined
with
garrets
and
ending
in
a
wooden
staircase
covered
with
the
musty
remnants
of
a
carpet
can
no
one
hear
me
asked
sernine
no
the
two
rooms
are
quite
detached
but
you
must
be
careful
not
to
make
a
mistake
he
is
in
the
room
on
the
left
very
good
now
go
downstairs
at
twelve
the
doctor
octave
and
you
are
to
carry
the
fellow
up
here
to
where
we
now
stand
and
wait
till
i
call
you
the
wooden
staircase
had
ten
treads
which
the
prince
climbed
with
definite
caution
at
the
top
was
a
landing
with
two
doors
it
took
sernine
quite
five
minutes
to
open
the
one
of
the
right
without
breaking
the
silence
with
the
least
sound
of
a
creaking
hinge
a
light
gleamed
through
the
darkness
of
the
room
feeling
his
way
so
as
not
to
knock
against
one
of
the
chairs
he
made
for
that
light
it
came
from
the
next
room
and
filtered
through
a
glazed
door
covered
with
a
tattered
hanging
the
prince
pulled
the
threadbare
stuff
aside
the
panes
were
of
ground
glass
but
scratched
in
parts
so
that
by
applying
one
eye
it
was
easy
to
see
all
that
happened
in
the
other
room
sernine
saw
a
man
seated
at
a
table
facing
him
it
was
the
poet
gérard
baupré
he
was
writing
by
the
light
of
a
candle
above
his
head
hung
a
rope
which
was
fastened
to
a
hook
fixed
in
the
ceiling
at
the
end
of
the
rope
was
a
a
faint
stroke
sounded
from
a
clock
in
the
street
five
minutes
to
twelve
thought
sernine
five
minutes
more
the
young
man
was
still
writing
after
a
moment
he
put
down
his
pen
collected
the
ten
or
twelve
sheets
of
paper
which
he
had
covered
and
began
to
read
them
over
what
he
read
did
not
seem
to
please
him
for
an
expression
of
discontent
passed
across
his
face
he
tore
up
his
manuscript
and
burnt
the
pieces
in
the
flame
of
the
candle
then
with
a
fevered
hand
he
wrote
a
few
words
on
a
clean
sheet
signed
it
savagely
and
rose
from
his
chair
but
seeing
the
rope
at
ten
inches
above
his
head
he
sat
down
again
suddenly
with
a
great
shudder
of
alarm
sernine
distinctly
saw
his
pale
features
his
lean
cheeks
against
which
he
pressed
his
clenched
fists
a
tear
trickled
slowly
down
his
face
a
single
disconsolate
tear
his
eyes
gazed
into
space
eyes
terrifying
in
their
unutterable
sadness
eyes
that
already
seemed
to
behold
the
dread
unknown
and
it
was
so
young
a
face
cheeks
still
so
smooth
with
not
a
blemish
not
a
wrinkle
and
blue
eyes
blue
like
an
eastern
sky
midnight
the
twelve
tragic
strokes
of
midnight
to
which
so
many
a
despairing
man
has
hitched
the
last
second
of
his
existence
at
the
twelfth
stroke
he
stood
up
again
and
bravely
this
time
without
trembling
looked
at
the
sinister
rope
he
even
tried
to
give
a
smile
a
poor
smile
the
pitiful
grimace
of
the
doomed
man
whom
death
has
already
seized
for
its
own
swiftly
he
climbed
the
chair
and
took
the
rope
in
one
hand
for
a
moment
he
stood
there
motionless
not
that
he
was
hesitating
or
lacking
in
courage
but
this
was
the
supreme
moment
the
one
minute
of
grace
which
a
man
allows
himself
before
the
fatal
deed
he
gazed
at
the
squalid
room
to
which
his
evil
destiny
had
brought
him
the
hideous
paper
on
the
walls
the
wretched
bed
on
the
table
not
a
book
all
were
sold
not
a
photograph
not
a
letter
he
had
no
father
no
mother
no
relations
what
was
there
to
make
him
cling
to
life
with
a
sudden
movement
he
put
his
head
into
the
and
pulled
at
the
rope
until
the
noose
gripped
his
neck
and
kicking
the
chair
from
him
with
both
feet
he
leapt
into
space
ten
seconds
fifteen
seconds
passed
twenty
formidable
eternal
seconds
the
body
gave
two
or
three
jerks
the
feet
had
instinctively
felt
for
a
then
nothing
moved
a
few
seconds
more
the
little
glazed
door
opened
sernine
entered
without
the
least
haste
he
took
the
sheet
of
paper
to
which
the
young
man
had
set
his
signature
and
read
tired
of
living
ill
penniless
hopeless
i
am
taking
my
own
life
let
no
one
be
accused
of
my
death
gérard
baupré
he
put
back
the
paper
on
the
table
where
it
could
be
seen
picked
up
the
chair
and
placed
it
under
the
young
man
feet
he
himself
climbed
up
on
the
table
and
holding
the
body
close
to
him
lifted
it
up
loosened
the
and
passed
the
head
through
it
the
body
sank
into
his
arms
he
let
it
slide
along
the
table
and
jumping
to
the
floor
laid
it
on
the
bed
then
with
the
same
coolness
he
opened
the
door
on
the
passage
are
you
there
all
the
three
of
you
he
whispered
some
one
answered
from
the
foot
of
the
wooden
staircase
near
him
we
are
here
are
we
to
hoist
up
our
bundle
yes
come
along
he
took
the
candle
and
showed
them
a
light
the
three
men
trudged
up
the
stairs
carrying
the
sack
in
which
the
fellow
was
tied
up
put
him
here
he
said
pointing
to
the
table
with
a
he
cut
the
cords
round
the
sack
a
white
sheet
appeared
which
he
flung
back
in
the
sheet
was
a
corpse
the
corpse
of
pierre
leduc
poor
pierre
leduc
said
sernine
you
will
never
know
what
you
lost
by
dying
so
young
i
should
have
helped
you
to
go
far
old
chap
however
we
must
do
without
your
services
now
then
philippe
get
up
on
the
table
and
you
octave
on
the
chair
lift
up
his
head
and
fasten
the
two
minutes
later
pierre
leduc
body
was
swinging
at
the
end
of
the
rope
capital
that
was
quite
simple
now
you
can
all
of
you
go
you
doctor
will
call
back
here
morning
you
will
hear
of
the
suicide
of
a
certain
gérard
baupré
you
understand
gérard
baupré
here
is
his
farewell
letter
you
will
send
for
the
divisional
surgeon
and
the
commissary
you
will
arrange
that
neither
of
them
notices
that
the
deceased
has
a
cut
finger
or
a
scar
on
one
cheek
that
easy
and
you
will
manage
so
as
to
have
the
report
written
then
and
there
to
your
dictation
that
easy
lastly
avoid
having
the
body
sent
to
the
morgue
and
make
them
give
permission
for
an
immediate
burial
that
not
so
easy
try
have
you
examined
the
other
one
he
pointed
to
the
young
man
lying
lifeless
on
the
bed
yes
said
the
doctor
the
breathing
is
becoming
normal
but
it
was
a
big
risk
to
run
the
carotid
artery
might
have
nothing
venture
nothing
have
how
soon
will
he
recover
consciousness
in
a
few
minutes
very
well
oh
by
the
way
do
go
yet
doctor
wait
for
me
downstairs
there
is
more
for
you
to
do
the
prince
when
he
found
himself
alone
lit
a
cigarette
and
puffed
at
it
quietly
sending
little
blue
rings
of
smoke
floating
up
to
the
ceiling
a
sigh
roused
him
from
his
thoughts
he
went
to
the
bed
the
young
man
was
beginning
to
move
and
his
chest
rose
and
fell
violently
like
that
of
a
sleeper
under
the
influence
of
a
nightmare
he
put
his
hands
to
his
throat
as
though
he
felt
a
pain
there
and
this
action
suddenly
made
him
sit
up
terrified
panting
then
he
saw
sernine
in
front
of
him
you
he
whispered
without
understanding
you
he
gazed
at
him
stupidly
as
though
he
had
seen
a
ghost
he
again
touched
his
throat
felt
round
his
neck
and
suddenly
he
gave
a
hoarse
cry
a
mad
terror
dilated
his
eyes
made
his
hair
stand
on
end
shook
him
from
head
to
foot
like
an
the
prince
had
moved
aside
and
he
saw
the
man
corpse
hanging
from
the
rope
he
flung
himself
back
against
the
wall
that
man
that
hanged
man
was
himself
he
was
dead
and
he
was
looking
at
his
own
dead
body
was
this
a
hideous
dream
that
follows
upon
death
a
hallucination
that
comes
to
those
who
are
no
more
and
whose
distracted
brain
still
quivers
with
a
last
flickering
gleam
of
life
his
arms
struck
at
the
air
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
be
defending
himself
against
the
squalid
vision
then
exhausted
he
fainted
away
for
the
second
time
said
the
prince
with
a
grin
a
sensitive
impressionable
nature
at
present
the
brain
is
out
of
gear
come
this
is
a
propitious
moment
but
if
i
do
get
the
business
done
in
twenty
minutes
he
escape
me
he
pushed
open
the
door
between
the
two
garrets
came
back
to
the
bed
lifted
the
young
man
and
carried
him
to
the
bed
in
the
other
room
then
he
bathed
his
temples
with
cold
water
and
made
him
sniff
at
some
salts
this
time
the
swoon
did
not
last
long
gérard
timidly
opened
his
eyes
and
raised
them
to
the
ceiling
the
vision
was
gone
but
the
arrangement
of
the
furniture
the
position
of
the
table
and
the
fireplace
and
certain
other
details
all
surprised
him
and
then
came
the
remembrance
of
his
act
the
pain
which
he
felt
at
his
throat
he
said
to
the
prince
i
have
had
a
dream
have
i
not
no
how
do
you
mean
no
and
suddenly
recollecting
oh
that
true
i
remember
i
meant
to
kill
myself
and
i
even
bending
forward
anxiously
but
the
rest
the
vision
what
vision
the
man
the
rope
was
that
a
dream
no
said
sernine
that
also
was
real
what
are
you
saying
what
are
you
saying
oh
no
no
i
entreat
you
wake
me
if
i
am
asleep
or
else
let
me
die
but
i
am
dead
am
i
not
and
this
is
the
nightmare
of
a
corpse
oh
i
feel
my
brain
going
i
entreat
you
sernine
placed
his
hand
gently
on
the
young
man
head
and
bending
over
him
listen
to
me
listen
to
me
carefully
and
understand
what
i
say
you
are
alive
your
matter
and
your
mind
are
as
they
were
and
live
but
gérard
baupré
is
dead
you
understand
me
do
you
not
that
member
of
society
who
was
known
as
gérard
baupré
has
ceased
to
exist
you
have
done
away
with
that
one
the
registrar
will
write
in
his
books
opposite
the
name
you
bore
the
word
with
the
date
of
your
decease
it
a
lie
stammered
the
terrified
lad
it
a
lie
considering
that
i
gérard
baupré
am
here
you
are
not
gérard
baupré
declared
sernine
and
pointing
to
the
open
door
gérard
baupré
is
there
in
the
next
room
do
you
wish
to
see
him
he
is
hanging
from
the
nail
to
which
you
hooked
him
on
the
table
is
a
letter
in
which
you
certify
his
death
with
your
signature
it
is
all
quite
regular
it
is
all
final
there
is
no
getting
away
from
the
irrevocable
brutal
fact
gérard
baupré
has
ceased
to
exist
the
young
man
listened
in
despair
growing
calmer
now
that
facts
were
assuming
a
less
tragic
significance
he
began
to
understand
and
then
he
muttered
and
then
let
us
talk
yes
yes
let
us
talk
a
cigarette
asked
the
prince
will
you
have
one
ah
i
see
that
you
are
becoming
reconciled
to
life
so
much
the
better
we
shall
understand
each
other
and
that
quickly
he
lit
the
young
man
cigarette
and
his
own
and
at
once
in
a
few
words
uttered
in
a
hard
voice
explained
himself
you
the
late
gérard
baupré
were
weary
of
life
ill
penniless
hopeless
would
you
like
to
be
well
rich
and
powerful
i
do
follow
you
it
is
quite
simple
accident
has
placed
you
on
my
path
you
are
young
a
poet
you
are
intelligent
and
your
act
of
despair
shows
it
you
have
a
fine
sense
of
conduct
these
are
qualities
which
are
rarely
found
united
in
one
person
i
value
them
and
i
take
them
for
my
account
they
are
not
for
sale
idiot
who
talks
of
buying
or
selling
keep
your
conscience
it
is
too
precious
a
jewel
for
me
to
relieve
you
of
it
then
what
do
you
ask
of
me
your
life
and
pointing
to
the
bruises
on
the
young
man
throat
your
life
which
you
have
not
known
how
to
employ
your
life
which
you
have
bungled
wasted
destroyed
and
which
i
propose
to
build
up
again
in
accordance
with
an
ideal
of
beauty
greatness
and
dignity
that
would
make
you
giddy
my
lad
if
you
saw
the
abyss
into
which
my
secret
thought
plunges
he
had
taken
gérard
head
between
his
hands
and
he
continued
eagerly
you
are
free
no
shackles
you
have
no
longer
the
weight
of
your
name
to
bear
you
have
got
rid
of
that
number
with
which
society
had
stamped
you
as
though
branding
you
on
the
shoulder
you
are
free
in
this
world
of
slaves
where
each
man
bears
his
label
you
can
either
come
and
go
unknown
invisible
as
if
you
owned
gyges
ring
or
else
you
can
choose
your
own
label
the
one
you
like
best
do
you
understand
the
magnificent
treasure
which
you
represent
to
an
artist
to
yourself
if
you
like
a
virgin
life
a
life
your
life
is
the
wax
which
you
have
the
right
to
fashion
as
you
please
according
to
the
whims
of
your
imagination
and
the
counsels
of
your
reason
the
young
man
made
a
gesture
expressive
of
weariness
ah
what
would
you
have
me
do
with
that
treasure
what
have
i
done
with
it
so
far
nothing
give
it
to
me
what
can
you
do
with
it
everything
if
you
are
not
an
artist
i
am
and
an
enthusiastic
artist
inexhaustible
indomitable
exuberant
if
you
have
not
the
promethean
fire
i
have
where
you
failed
i
shall
succeed
give
me
your
life
words
promises
cried
the
young
man
whose
features
began
to
glow
with
animation
empty
dreams
i
know
my
own
worthlessness
i
know
my
cowardice
my
despondency
my
efforts
that
come
to
nothing
all
my
wretchedness
to
begin
life
anew
i
should
need
a
will
which
i
do
not
possess
i
possess
mine
friends
you
shall
have
them
means
i
am
providing
you
with
means
and
such
means
you
will
only
have
to
dip
as
one
would
dip
into
a
magic
coffer
but
who
are
you
cried
the
young
man
wildly
to
others
prince
sernine
to
you
what
does
it
matter
i
am
more
than
a
prince
more
than
a
king
more
than
an
emperor
who
are
you
who
are
you
stammered
baupré
the
master
he
who
will
and
who
can
he
who
acts
there
are
no
bounds
to
my
will
there
is
none
to
my
power
i
am
richer
than
the
richest
man
alive
for
his
fortune
is
mine
i
am
more
powerful
than
the
mightiest
for
their
might
is
at
my
service
he
took
the
other
head
in
his
hands
again
and
looking
deep
into
his
eyes
be
rich
too
be
mighty
i
offer
you
happiness
and
the
joy
of
living
and
peace
for
your
poet
brain
and

and
glory

accept
yes
yes
whispered
gérard
dazzled
and
overmastered
what
am
i
to
do
nothing
but
nothing
i
say
the
whole
scaffolding
of
my
plans
rests
on
you
but
you
do
not
count
you
have
no
active
part
to
play
you
are
for
the
moment
but
a
silent
actor
or
not
even
that
but
just
a
pawn
which
i
move
along
the
board
what
shall
i
do
nothing
write
poetry
you
shall
live
as
you
please
you
shall
have
money
you
shall
enjoy

i
will
not
even
bother
my
head
about
you
i
repeat
you

no
part
in
my
venture
and
who
shall
i
be
sernine
stretched
out
his
arm
and
pointed
to
the
next
room
you
shall
take
that
man
place
are
that
man
gérard
shuddered
with
revolt
and
disgust
oh
no
he
is
dead
and
then
it
is
a
crime
no
i
want
a
new
life

for

out
for

unknown

man
i
tell
you
cried
sernine
irresistible
in
his
energy
and
authority
you
shall
be
that
man
and
none
other
that
man
because
his
destiny
is
magnificent
because
his
name
is
illustrious
and
because
he
hands
down
to
you
a
heritage
of
ancestral
dignity
and
pride
it
is
a
crime
moaned
baupré
faltering
you
shall
be
that
man
spoke
sernine
with
unparalleled
vehemence
you
shall
be
that
man
if
not
you
become
baupré
again
and
over
baupré
i
own
rights
of
life
and
death
choose
he
drew
his
revolver
cocked
it
and
took
aim
at
the
young
man
choose
he
repeated
the
expression
of
his
face
was
implacable
gérard
was
frightened
and
sank
down
on
his
bed
sobbing
i
wish
to
live
you
wish
it
firmly
irrevocably
yes
a
thousand
times
yes
after
the
terrible
thing
which
i
attempted
death
appals
me
anything
anything
rather
than
death
anything
pain
hunger
illness
every
torture
every
shame
crime
itself
if
need
be
but
not
death
he
shivered
with
fever
and
agony
as
though
the
great
enemy
were
still
prowling
round
him
and
as
though
he
felt
himself
powerless
to
escape
from
its
clutches
the
prince
redoubled
his
efforts
and
in
a
fervent
voice
holding
him
under
him
like
a
prey
i
will
ask
nothing
impossible
of
you
nothing
wrong
if
there
is
anything
i
am
responsible
no
no
crime
a
little
pain
at
most
a
little
of
your
blood
must
flow
but
what
is
that
compared
with
the
dread
of
dying
pain
is
indifferent
to
me
then
here
and
now
shouted
sernine
here
and
now
ten
seconds
of
pain
and
that
is
all
ten
seconds
and
the
other
life
is
yours
he
had
seized
him
round
the
body
and
forced
him
down
on
a
chair
and
he
now
held
the
young
man
left
hand
flat
on
the
table
with
his
five
fingers
spread
out
he
swiftly
took
a
knife
from
his
pocket
pressed
the
blade
against
the
little
finger
between
the
first
and
second
joints
and
commanded
strike
strike
your
own
blow
one
blow
of
the
fist
and
that
is
all
he
had
taken
gérard
right
hand
and
was
trying
to
bring
it
down
upon
the
other
like
a
hammer
gérard
writhed
and
twisted
convulsed
with
horror
he
understood
never
he
stuttered
never
strike
one
blow
and
it
done
one
blow
and
you
will
be
like
that
man
no
one
will
recognize
you
tell
me
his
name
strike
first
never
oh
what
torture
i
beseech
you
presently
now
i
insist
you
must
no
no
i
ca
do
it
strike
you
fool
it
means
fortune
fame
love
gérard
raised
his
fist
with
a
sudden
movement
love
he
said
yes
for
that
yes
you
will
love
and
be
loved
said
sernine
your
betrothed
awaits
you
i
have
chosen
her
myself
she
is
the
purest
of
the
pure
the
fairest
of
the
fair
but
you
must
win
her
strike
the
lad
arm
stiffened
for
the
fatal
blow
but
the
instinct
of
was
too
strong
for
him
his
body
was
wrung
with
a
superhuman
effort
he
suddenly
released
himself
from
sernine
hold
and
fled
he
rushed
like
a
madman
to
the
other
room
a
yell
of
terror
escaped
him
at
the
sight
of
the
abominable
vision
and
he
came
back
and
fell
on
his
knees
before
sernine
beside
the
table
strike
said
the
prince
again
spreading
out
the
lad
fingers
and
fixing
the
blade
of
the
knife
what
followed
was
done
mechanically
with
an
automatic
movement
with
haggard
eyes
and
a
livid
face
the
young
man
raised
his
fist
and
struck
ah
he
cried
with
a
moan
of
pain
a
small
piece
of
flesh
was
separated
from
the
little
finger
blood
flowed
for
the
third
time
gérard
fainted
sernine
looked
at
him
for
a
second
or
two
and
said
gently
poor
little
chap
there
i
reward
you
for
what
you
done
and
a
hundred
times
over
i
always
pay
generously
he
went
downstairs
and
found
the
doctor
waiting
below
it
done
go
upstairs
you
and
make
a
little
cut
in
his
right
cheek
similar
to
pierre
leduc
the
two
scars
must
be
exactly
alike
i
shall
come
back
for
you
in
an
hour
where
are
you
going
to
take
the
air
my
heart
feels
anyhow
outside
he
drew
a
long
breath
and
lit
another
cigarette
a
good
day
work
he
muttered
a
little
a
little
tiring
but
fruitful
really
fruitful
i
am
dolores
kesselbach
friend
i
am
geneviève
friend
i
have
manufactured
a
new
pierre
leduc
a
very
presentable
one
and
entirely
at
my
disposal
lastly
i
have
found
geneviève
a
husband
of
the
sort
that
you
do
find
by
the
dozen
now
my
task

i
have
only
to
gather
the
fruit
of
my
efforts

turn
to
work
lenormand
i
for
my
part

and
he
added
thinking
of
the
poor
mutilated
lad
whom
he
had
dazzled
with
his
promises
only
for
there
is
an
i
have
not
the
slightest
notion
who
this
pierre
leduc
was
whose
place
i
have
magnanimously
awarded
to
that
good
young
man
and
that
very
annoying
for
when
all
is
said
there
nothing
to
prove
to
me
that
pierre
leduc
was
not
the
son
of
a
chapter
v
lenormand
at
work
on
the
morning
of
the
of
may
all
the
newspapers
reminded
their
readers
that
lupin
in
a
letter
addressed
to
lenormand
had
announced
the
escape
of
the
messenger
jérôme
for
that
date
and
one
of
them
summed
up
the
situation
as
it
then
stood
in
very
able
terms
the
horrible
carnage
at
the
palace
hotel
took
place
as
far
back
as
the
of
april
what
has
been
discovered
since
nothing
there
were
three
clues
the
the
initials
l
and
m
and
the
parcel
of
clothes
left
behind
in
the
office
of
the
hotel
what
advantage
has
been
taken
of
these
clues
none
it
appears
that
the
police
suspect
one
of
the
visitors
who
was
staying
on
the
first
floor
and
who
disappeared
in
a
doubtful
manner
have
they
found
him
have
they
established
his
identity
no
the
tragedy
therefore
remains
as
mysterious
as
at
the
beginning
the
gloom
is
impenetrable
to
complete
the
picture
we
are
told
that
dissension
prevails
between
the
prefect
of
police
and
his
subordinate
lenormand
and
that
the
latter
finding
himself
less
vigorously
supported
by
the
prime
minister
virtually
sent
in
his
resignation
several
days
ago
according
to
our
information
the
conduct
of
the
kesselbach
case
is
now
in
the
hands
of
the
of
the
weber
a
personal
enemy
of
lenormand
in
short
disorder
and
confusion
reign
and
this
in
the
face
of
lupin
who
stands
for
method
energy
and
steadfastness
of
mind
what
conclusion
do
we
draw
from
these
facts
briefly
this
lupin
will
release
his
accomplice
the
of
may
as
he
foretold
this
conclusion
which
was
echoed
in
all
the
other
newspapers
was
also
the
conclusion
at
which
the
general
public
had
arrived
and
we
must
take
it
that
the
threat
was
not
considered
devoid
of
importance
in
high
places
for
the
prefect
of
police
and
in
the
absence
of
lenormand
who
was
said
to
be
unwell
the
of
the
weber
had
adopted
the
most
stringent
measures
both
at
the
palais
de
justice
and
at
the
santé
prison
where
the
prisoner
was
confined
they
did
not
dare
for
sheer
reasons
of
shame
to
suspend
on
that
particular
day
the
examinations
conducted
daily
by
formerie
but
from
the
prison
to
the
boulevard
du
palais
a
regular
mobilization
of
guarded
the
streets
along
the
line
to
the
intense
astonishment
of
one
and
all
the
of
may
passed
and
the
threatened
escape
did
not
take
place
one
thing
did
happen
an
attempt
to
execute
the
plan
as
was
betrayed
by
a
block
of
omnibuses
and
drays
along
the
road
taken
by
the
and
the
unaccountable
breaking
of
one
of
the
wheels
of
the
van
itself
but
the
attempt
assumed
no
more
definite
form
lupin
therefore
had
met
with
a
check
the
public
felt
almost
disappointed
and
the
police
triumphed
loudly
on
the
next
day
saturday
an
incredible
rumour
spread
through
the
palais
and
the
jérôme
the
messenger
had
disappeared
was
it
possible
although
the
special
editions
confirmed
the
news
people
refused
to
believe
it
but
at
six
a
note
published
by
the
du
made
it
official
we
have
received
the
following
communication
signed
by
arsène
lupin
the
special
stamp
affixed
to
it
in
accordance
with
the
circular
which
lupin
recently
sent
to
the
press
guarantees
the
genuineness
of
the
document
the
editor
of
dépêche
du
soir
sir
make
my
apologies
to
the
public
for
not
keeping
my
word
yesterday
i
remembered
at
the
last
moment
that
the
of
may
fell
on
a
friday
could
i
set
my
friend
at
liberty
on
a
friday
i
did
not
think
it
right
to
assume
that
responsibility
must
also
apologize
for
not
on
this
occasion
explaining
with
my
customary
frankness
how
this
little
event
was
managed
my
process
is
so
ingenious
and
so
simple
that
i
fear
lest
if
i
revealed
it
every
criminal
should
be
inspired
by
it
how
surprised
people
will
be
on
the
day
when
i
am
free
to
speak
is
that
all
i
shall
be
asked
that
is
all
but
it
had
to
be
thought
of
me
to
be
sir
obedient
servant
lupin
an
hour
later
lenormand
was
rung
up
on
the
telephone
and
informed
that
valenglay
the
prime
minister
wished
to
see
him
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
how
well
you
looking
my
dear
lenormand
and
i
who
thought
that
you
were
ill
and
dared
not
leave
your
room
i
am
not
ill
monsieur
le
président
so
you
were
sulking
in
your
tent
but
you
were
always
a
fellow
i
confess
to
the
bad
temper
monsieur
le
président
but
not
to
the
sulking
but
you
stay
at
home
and
lupin
takes
advantage
of
it
to
release
his
friends
how
could
i
stop
him
how
why
lupin
trick
was
of
the
plainest
in
accordance
with
his
usual
method
he
announced
the
date
of
the
escape
beforehand
everybody
believed
in
it
an
apparent
attempt
was
planned
the
escape
was
not
made
and
on
the
next
day
when
nobody
is
thinking
about
it
whoosh
the
bird
takes
flight
monsieur
le
président
said
the
chief
of
the
solemnly
lupin
disposes
of
such
means
that
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
prevent
what
he
has
decided
on
the
escape
was
mathematically
certain
i
preferred
to
pass
the
hand
and
leave
the
laughter
for
others
to
face
valenglay
chuckled
it
a
fact
that
monsieur
le
préfet
de
police
and
weber
can
not
be
enjoying
themselves
at
the
present
moment
but
when
all
is
said
can
you
explain
to
me
lenormand
all
that
we
know
monsieur
le
président
is
that
the
escape
took
place
from
the
palais
de
justice
the
prisoner
was
brought
in
a
and
taken
to
formerie
room
he
left
formerie
room
but
he
did
not
leave
the
palais
de
justice
and
yet
nobody
knows
what
became
of
him
it
most
bewildering
most
bewildering
and
has
nothing
else
been
discovered
yes
the
inner
corridor
leading
to
the
examining
magistrates
rooms
was
blocked
by
an
absolutely
unprecedented
crowd
of
prisoners
warders
counsel
and
doorkeepers
and
it
was
discovered
that
all
those
people
had
received
forged
notices
to
appear
at
the
same
hour
on
the
other
hand
not
one
of
the
who
were
supposed
to
have
summoned
them
sat
in
his
room
that
day
and
this
because
of
forged
notices
from
the
public
prosecutor
office
sending
them
to
every
part
of
paris
and
of
the
outskirts
is
that
all
no
two
municipal
guards
and
a
prisoner
were
seen
to
cross
the
courtyards
a
cab
was
waiting
for
them
outside
and
all
three
stepped
in
and
your
supposition
lenormand
your
opinion
my
supposition
monsieur
le
président
is
that
the
two
municipal
guards
were
accomplices
who
profiting
by
the
disorder
in
the
corridor
took
the
place
of
the
three
warders
and
my
opinion
is
that
this
escape
succeeded
only
through
such
special
circumstances
and
so
strange
a
combination
of
facts
that
we
must
look
upon
the
most
unlikely
cases
of
complicity
as
absolutely
certain
lupin
for
that
matter
has
connections
at
the
palais
that
balk
all
our
calculations
he
has
agents
in
your
ministry
he
has
agents
at
the
prefecture
of
police
he
has
agents
around
me
it
is
a
formidable
organization
a
a
thousand
times
more
clever
more
daring
more
varied
and
more
supple
than
that
under
my
own
orders
and
you
stand
this
lenormand
no
i
do
not
then
why
this
slackness
on
your
part
since
the
beginning
of
the
case
what
have
you
done
against
lupin
i
have
prepared
for
the
struggle
ah
capital
and
while
you
were
preparing
he
was
acting
so
was
i
and
do
you
know
anything
i
know
a
great
deal
what
speak
leaning
on
his
stick
lenormand
took
a
little
contemplative
walk
across
the
spacious
room
then
he
sat
down
opposite
valenglay
brushed
the
facings
of
his
coat
with
his
settled
his
spectacles
on
his
nose
and
said
plainly
le
président
i
hold
three
in
my
hand
first
i
know
the
name
under
which
arsène
lupin
is
hiding
at
this
moment
the
name
under
which
he
lived
on
the
boulevard
haussmann
receiving
his
assistants
daily
reconstructing
and
directing
his
gang
but
then
why
in
heaven
name
do
you
arrest
him
i
did
not
receive
these
particulars
until
later
the
prince
let
us
call
him
prince
dash
has
disappeared
he
is
abroad
on
other
business
and
if
he
does
not
return
the
position
which
he
occupies
the
manner
in
which
he
has
flung
himself
into
the
kesselbach
case
necessitate
his
return
and
under
the
same
name
nevertheless
monsieur
le
président
i
come
to
my
second
trump
i
have
at
last
discovered
pierre
leduc
nonsense
or
rather
lupin
discovered
him
and
before
disappearing
settled
him
in
a
little
villa
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
by
jove
but
how
did
you
know
oh
easily
lupin
has
placed
two
of
his
accomplices
with
pierre
leduc
to
watch
him
and
defend
him
now
these
accomplices
are
two
of
my
own
detectives
two
brothers
whom
i
employ
in
the
greatest
secrecy
and
who
will
hand
him
over
to
me
at
the
first
opportunity
well
done
you
so
that
so
that
as
pierre
leduc
we
may
say
is
the
central
point
of
the
efforts
of
all
those
who
are
trying
to
solve
the
famous
kesselbach
secret
i
shall
sooner
or
later
through
pierre
leduc
catch
first
the
author
of
the
treble
murder
because
that
miscreant
substituted
himself
for
kesselbach
in
the
accomplishment
of
an
immense
scheme
and
because
kesselbach
had
to
find
pierre
leduc
in
order
to
be
able
to
accomplish
that
scheme
and
secondly
arsène
lupin
because
arsène
lupin
is
pursuing
the
same
object
splendid
pierre
leduc
is
the
bait
which
you
are
throwing
to
the
enemy
and
the
fish
is
biting
monsieur
le
président
i
have
just
had
word
that
a
suspicious
person
was
seen
a
short
time
ago
prowling
round
the
little
villa
where
pierre
leduc
is
living
under
the
protection
of
my
officers
i
shall
be
on
the
spot
in
four
hours
and
the
third
trump
lenormand
monsieur
le
président
a
letter
arrived
yesterday
addressed
to
rudolf
kesselbach
which
i
intercepted
intercepted
eh
you
getting
on
yes
i
intercepted
it
opened
it
and
kept
it
for
myself
here
it
is
it
is
dated
two
months
back
it
bears
the
capetown
postmark
and
contains
these
words
dear
rudolf
i
shall
be
in
paris
on
the
of
june
and
in
just
as
wretched
a
plight
as
when
you
came
to
my
assistance
but
i
have
great
hopes
of
this
pierre
leduc
affair
of
which
i
told
you
what
a
strange
story
it
is
have
you
found
the
man
i
mean
where
do
we
stand
i
am
most
anxious
to
know
the
letter
is
signed
the
first
of
june
continued
lenormand
is
i
have
ordered
one
of
my
inspectors
to
hunt
me
out
this
steinweg
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
will
succeed
nor
i
no
doubt
at
all
cried
valenglay
rising
from
his
chair
and
i
make
you
every
apology
my
dear
lenormand
and
my
humble
confession
i
was
on
the
point
of
letting
you
slide
for
good
and
all
i
was
expecting
the
prefect
of
police
and
m
weber
i
knew
that
monsieur
le
président
impossible
but
for
that
should
i
have
put
myself
out
you
now
see
my
plan
of
campaign
on
the
one
side
i
am
setting
traps
in
which
the
murderer
will
be
caught
sooner
or
later
pierre
leduc
or
steinweg
will
deliver
him
into
my
hands
on
the
other
side
i
am
on
arsène
lupin
heels
two
of
his
agents
are
in
my
pay
and
he
believes
them
to
be
his
most
devoted
helpers
in
addition
to
this
he
is
working
for
me
because
he
is
pursuing
the
perpetrator
of
the
threefold
crime
as
i
am
only
he
imagines
that
he
is
dishing
me
whereas
it
is
i
who
am
dishing
him
so
i
shall
succeed
but
on
one
condition
what
is
that
that
i
am
given
free
scope
and
allowed
to
act
according
to
the
needs
of
the
moment
without
troubling
about
the
public
who
are
growing
impatient
or
my
superiors
who
are
intriguing
against
me
i
agree
in
that
case
monsieur
le
président
in
a
few
days
from
this
i
shall
be
the
victor
or
i
shall
be
dead
at
a
little
villa
situated
on
one
of
the
highest
points
of
the
upland
in
an
unfrequented
road
it
was
eleven
at
night
lenormand
left
his
car
at
and
walked
cautiously
along
the
road
a
shadow
appeared
is
that
you
gourel
yes
chief
did
you
tell
the
brothers
doudeville
that
i
was
coming
yes
your
room
is
ready
you
can
go
to
bed
and
sleep
unless
they
try
to
carry
off
pierre
leduc
which
would
not
surprise
me
considering
the
behavior
of
the
fellow
whom
the
doudevilles
saw
they
walked
across
the
garden
softly
entered
the
house
and
went
up
to
the
first
floor
the
two
brothers
jean
and
jacques
doudeville
were
there
no
news
of
prince
sernine
asked
lenormand
no
chief
what
about
pierre
leduc
he
spends
the
whole
day
lying
flat
on
his
back
in
his
room
on
the
or
else
in
the
garden
he
never
comes
up
to
see
us
is
he
better
much
better
the
rest
has
made
a
great
change
in
his
appearance
is
he
wholly
devoted
to
lupin
to
prince
sernine
rather
for
he
does
not
suspect
that
the
two
are
one
and
the
same
man
at
least
i
suppose
so
one
never
knows
with
him
he
does
not
speak
at
all
oh
he
a
queer
fish
there
only
one
person
who
has
the
gift
of
cheering
him
up
of
making
him
talk
and
even
laugh
that
a
young
girl
from
garches
to
whom
prince
sernine
introduced
him
geneviève
ernemont
her
name
is
she
has
been
here
three
times
already
she
was
here
he
added
jestingly
i
believe
there
a
little
flirting
going
on
it
like
his
highness
prince
sernine
and
kesselbach
it
seems
he
making
eyes
at
her
that
devil
of
a
lupin
lenormand
did
not
reply
but
it
was
obvious
that
all
these
details
to
which
he
seemed
to
attach
no
importance
were
noted
in
the
recesses
of
his
memory
to
be
used
whenever
he
might
need
to
draw
the
logical
inferences
from
them
he
lit
a
cigar
chewed
it
without
smoking
it
lit
it
again
and
dropped
it
he
asked
two
or
three
more
questions
and
then
dressed
as
he
was
threw
himself
on
his
bed
if
the
least
thing
happens
let
me
be
awakened
if
not
i
shall
sleep
through
the
night
go
to
your
posts
all
of
you
the
others
left
the
room
an
hour
passed
two
hours
suddenly
lenormand
felt
some
one
touch
him
and
gourel
said
to
him
get
up
chief
they
have
opened
the
gate
one
man
or
two
i
only
saw
one
the
moon
appeared
just
then
he
crouched
down
against
a
hedge
and
the
brothers
doudeville
i
sent
them
out
by
the
back
they
will
cut
off
his
retreat
when
the
time
comes
gourel
took
lenormand
hand
led
him
downstairs
and
then
into
a
little
dark
room
do
stir
chief
we
are
in
pierre
leduc
i
am
opening
the
door
of
the
recess
in
which
his
bed
stands
do
be
afraid
he
has
taken
his
veronal
as
he
does
every
evening
nothing
can
wake
him
come
this
way
it
a
good
is
it
these
are
the
curtains
of
his
bed
from
here
you
can
see
the
window
and
the
whole
side
of
the
room
between
the
window
and
the
bed
the
casement
stood
open
and
admitted
a
vague
light
which
became
very
precise
at
times
when
the
moon
burst
through
her
veil
of
clouds
the
two
men
did
not
take
their
eyes
from
the
empty
feeling
certain
that
the
event
which
they
were
awaiting
would
come
from
that
side
a
slight
creaking
noise
he
is
climbing
the
trellis
whispered
gourel
is
it
high
six
feet
or
so
the
creaking
became
more
distinct
go
gourel
muttered
lenormand
find
the
doudevilles
bring
them
back
to
the
foot
of
the
wall
and
bar
the
road
to
any
one
who
tries
to
get
down
this
way
gourel
went
at
the
same
moment
a
head
appeared
at
the
level
of
the
window
then
a
leg
was
flung
over
the
balcony
lenormand
distinguished
a
man
below
the
middle
height
dressed
in
dark
colours
and
without
a
hat
the
man
turned
and
leaning
over
the
balcony
looked
for
a
few
seconds
into
space
as
though
to
make
sure
that
no
danger
threatened
him
then
he
stooped
down
and
lay
at
full
length
on
the
floor
he
appeared
motionless
but
soon
lenormand
realized
that
the
still
blacker
shadow
which
he
formed
against
the
surrounding
darkness
was
coming
forward
nearer
it
reached
the
bed
lenormand
had
an
impression
that
he
could
hear
the
man
breathing
and
at
the
same
time
that
he
could
just
see
his
eyes
keen
glittering
eyes
which
pierced
the
darkness
like
shafts
of
fire
and
which
themselves
could
see
through
that
same
darkness
pierre
leduc
gave
a
deep
sigh
and
turned
over
a
fresh
silence
the
man
had
glided
along
the
bed
with
imperceptible
movements
and
his
dark
outline
now
stood
out
against
the
whiteness
of
the
sheets
that
hung
down
to
the
floor
lenormand
could
have
touched
him
by
putting
out
his
arm
this
time
he
clearly
distinguished
the
breathing
which
alternated
with
that
of
the
sleeper
and
he
had
the
illusion
that
he
also
heard
the
sound
of
a
heart
beating
suddenly
a
flash
of
light
the
man
had
pressed
the
spring
of
an
electric
lantern
and
pierre
leduc
was
lit
full
in
the
face
but
the
man
remained
in
the
shade
so
that
lenormand
was
unable
to
see
his
features
all
that
he
saw
was
something
that
shone
in
the
bright
space
and
he
shuddered
it
was
the
blade
of
a
knife
and
that
thin
tapering
knife
more
like
a
stiletto
than
a
dagger
seemed
to
him
identical
with
the
weapon
which
he
had
picked
up
by
the
body
of
chapman
secretary
he
put
forth
all
his
to
restrain
himself
from
springing
upon
the
man
he
wanted
first
to
know
what
the
man
had
come
to
do
the
hand
was
raised
was
he
going
to
strike
lenormand
calculated
the
distance
in
order
to
stop
the
blow
but
no
it
was
not
a
murderous
gesture
but
one
of
caution
the
hand
would
only
fall
if
pierre
leduc
stirred
or
tried
to
call
out
and
the
man
bent
over
the
sleeper
as
though
he
were
examining
something
the
right
cheek
thought
lenormand
the
scar
on
the
right
cheek
he
wants
to
make
sure
that
it
is
really
pierre
leduc
the
man
had
turned
a
little
to
one
side
so
that
only
his
shoulders
were
visible
but
his
clothes
his
overcoat
were
so
near
that
they
brushed
against
the
curtains
behind
which
lenormand
was
hiding
one
movement
on
his
part
thought
the
chief
detective
a
thrill
of
alarm
and
i
shall
collar
him
but
the
man
entirely
absorbed
in
his
examination
did
not
stir
at
last
after
shifting
the
dagger
to
the
hand
that
held
the
lantern
he
raised
the
sheet
at
first
hardly
at
all
then
a
little
more
then
more
still
until
the
sleeper
left
arm
was
uncovered
and
the
hand
laid
bare
the
flash
of
the
lantern
shone
upon
the
hand
the
fingers
lay
outspread
the
little
finger
was
cut
on
the
second
joint
again
pierre
leduc
made
a
movement
the
light
was
immediately
put
out
and
for
an
instant
the
man
remained
beside
the
bed
motionless
standing
straight
up
would
he
make
up
his
mind
to
strike
lenormand
underwent
the
agony
of
the
crime
which
he
could
so
easily
prevent
but
which
he
did
not
want
to
forestall
before
the
very
last
second
a
long
a
very
long
silence
suddenly
he
saw
or
rather
fancied
that
he
saw
an
arm
uplifted
instinctively
he
moved
stretching
his
hand
above
the
sleeper
in
making
this
gesture
he
hit
against
the
man
a
dull
cry
the
fellow
struck
out
at
space
defended
himself
at
random
and
fled
toward
the
window
but
lenormand
had
leapt
upon
him
and
had
his
two
arms
around
the
man
shoulders
he
at
once
felt
him
yielding
and
as
the
weaker
of
the
two
powerless
in
lenormand
hands
trying
to
avoid
the
struggle
and
to
slip
from
between
his
arms
lenormand
exerting
all
his
strength
held
him
flat
against
his
chest
bent
him
in
two
and
stretched
him
on
his
back
on
the
floor
ah
i
got
him
i
got
him
he
muttered
triumphantly
and
he
felt
a
singular
elation
at
imprisoning
that
terrifying
criminal
that
unspeakable
monster
in
his
irresistible
grip
he
felt
him
living
and
quivering
enraged
and
desperate
their
two
lives
mingled
their
breaths
blended
who
are
you
he
asked
who
are
you
you
have
to
speak
and
he
clasped
the
enemy
body
with
still
greater
force
for
he
had
an
impression
that
that
body
was
diminishing
between
his
arms
that
it
was
vanishing
he
gripped
harder
and
harder
and
suddenly
he
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
he
had
felt
he
still
felt
a
tiny
prick
in
the
throat
in
his
exasperation
he
gripped
harder
yet
the
pain
increased
and
he
observed
that
the
man
had
succeeded
in
twisting
one
arm
round
slipping
his
hand
to
his
chest
and
holding
the
dagger
on
end
the
arm
it
was
true
was
incapable
of
motion
but
the
closer
lenormand
tightened
his
grip
the
deeper
did
the
point
of
the
dagger
enter
the
proffered
flesh
he
flung
back
his
head
a
little
to
escape
the
point
the
point
followed
the
movement
and
the
wound
widened
then
he
moved
no
more
remembering
the
three
crimes
and
all
the
alarming
atrocious
and
prophetic
things
represented
by
that
same
little
steel
needle
which
was
piercing
his
skin
and
which
in
its
turn
was
implacably
penetrating
suddenly
he
let
go
and
gave
a
leap
backwards
then
at
once
he
tried
to
resume
the
offensive
it
was
too
late
the
man
flung
his
legs
across
the
and
jumped
look
out
gourel
he
cried
knowing
that
gourel
was
there
ready
to
catch
the
fugitive
he
leant
out
a
crunching
of
pebbles
a
shadow
between
two
trees
the
slam
of
the
gate
and
no
other
sound
no
interference
without
giving
a
thought
to
pierre
leduc
he
called
gourel
doudeville
no
answer
the
great
silence
of
the
countryside
at
night
in
spite
of
himself
he
continued
to
think
of
the
treble
murder
the
steel
dagger
but
no
it
was
impossible
the
man
had
not
had
time
had
not
even
had
the
need
to
strike
as
he
had
found
the
road
clear
lenormand
jumped
out
in
his
turn
and
switching
on
his
lantern
recognized
gourel
lying
on
the
ground
damn
it
he
swore
if
they
killed
him
they
have
to
pay
dearly
for
it
but
gourel
was
not
dead
only
stunned
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
came
to
himself
and
growled
only
a
blow
of
the
fist
chief
just
a
blow
of
the
fist
which
caught
me
full
in
the
chest
but
what
a
fellow
there
were
two
of
them
then
yes
a
little
one
who
went
up
and
another
who
took
me
unawares
while
i
was
watching
and
the
doudevilles
have
seen
them
one
of
them
jacques
was
found
near
the
gate
bleeding
from
a
punch
in
the
jaw
the
other
a
little
farther
gasping
for
breath
from
a
blow
full
on
the
chest
what
is
it
what
happened
asked
lenormand
jacques
said
that
his
brother
and
he
had
knocked
up
against
an
individual
who
had
crippled
them
before
they
had
time
to
defend
themselves
was
he
alone
no
when
he
passed
near
us
he
had
a
pal
with
him
shorter
than
himself
did
you
recognize
the
man
who
struck
you
judging
by
the
breadth
of
his
shoulders
i
thought
he
might
be
the
englishman
of
the
palace
hotel
the
one
who
left
the
hotel
and
whose
traces
we
lost
the
major
yes
major
parbury
after
a
moment
reflection
lenormand
said
there
is
no
doubt
possible
there
were
two
of
them
in
the
kesselbach
case
the
man
with
the
dagger
who
committed
the
murders
and
his
accomplice
the
major
that
is
what
prince
sernine
thinks
muttered
jacques
doudeville
and
continued
the
chief
detective
it
is
they
again
the
same
two
and
he
added
so
much
the
better
the
chance
of
catching
two
criminals
is
a
hundred
times
greater
than
the
chance
of
catching
one
lenormand
attended
to
his
men
had
them
put
to
bed
and
looked
to
see
if
the
assailants
had
dropped
anything
or
left
any
traces
he
found
nothing
and
went
back
to
bed
again
himself
in
the
morning
as
gourel
and
the
doudevilles
felt
none
the
worse
for
their
injuries
he
told
the
two
brothers
to
scour
the
neighborhood
and
himself
set
out
with
gourel
for
paris
in
order
to
hurry
matters
on
and
give
his
orders
he
lunched
in
his
office
at
two
he
heard
good
news
one
of
his
best
detectives
dieuzy
had
picked
up
steinweg
rudolf
correspondent
as
the
german
was
stepping
out
of
a
train
from
marseilles
is
dieuzy
there
yes
chief
said
gourel
he
here

the
german
have
them
brought
in
to
me
at
that
moment
the
rang
it
was
jean
doudeville
speaking
from
the
at
garches
the
conversation
did
not
take
long
is
that

major
parbury

have
found
him

has
become
a
spaniard
and
has
darkened
his
skin
we
have
just
seen
him
he
was
entering
the
garches
he
was
received
by
that
young
lady
you
know
the
girl
who
knows
prince
sernine
geneviève
ernemont
thunder
lenormand
let
go
the
receiver
made
a
grab
at
his
hat
flew
into
the
passage
met
dieuzy
and
the
german
shouted
to
them
to
meet
him
in
his
office
at
six
rushed
down
the
stairs
followed
by
gourel
and
two
inspectors
whom
he
picked
up
on
the
way
and
dived
into
a
quick
as
you
can
to
garches
ten
francs
for
yourself
he
stopped
the
car
a
little
before
the
parc
de
villeneuve
at
the
turn
of
the
lane
that
led
to
the
school
jean
doudeville
was
waiting
for
him
and
at
once
exclaimed
he
slipped
away
ten
minutes
ago
by
the
other
end
of
the
lane
alone
no
with
the
girl
lenormand
took
doudeville
by
the
collar
wretch
you
let
him
go
but
you
ought
to
have
you
ought
to
have
my
brother

on
his
track
a
lot
of
good
that
will
do
us
he
stick
your
brother
you
no
match
for
him
either
of
you
he
himself
took
the
of
the
taxi
and
resolutely
drove
into
the
lane
regardless
of
the
and
of
the
bushes
on
each
side
they
soon
emerged
on
a
which
took
them
to
a
crossway
where
five
roads
met
lenormand
without
hesitation
chose
the
one
on
the
left
the
road
as
a
matter
of
fact
at
the
top
of
the
slope
that
runs
down
to
the
lake
they
met
the
other
doudeville
brother
who
shouted
they
are
in
a
carriage
half
a
mile
away
the
chief
did
not
stop
he
sent
the
car
flying
down
the
incline
rushed
along
the
bends
drove
round
the
lake
and
suddenly
uttered
an
exclamation
of
triumph
right
at
the
top
of
a
little
hill
that
stood
in
front
of
them
he
had
seen
the
hood
of
a
carriage
unfortunately
he
had
taken
the
wrong
road
and
had
to
back
the
machine
when
he
reached
the
place
where
the
roads
branched
the
carriage
was
still
there
stationary
and
suddenly
while
he
was
turning
he
saw
a
girl
spring
from
the
carriage
a
man
appeared
on
the
step
the
girl
stretched
out
her
arm
two
reports
rang
out
she
had
taken
bad
aim
without
a
doubt
for
a
head
looked
round
the
other
side
of
the
hood
and
the
man
catching
sight
of
the
gave
his
horse
a
great
lash
with
the
whip
and
it
started
off
at
a
gallop
the
next
moment
a
turn
of
the
road
hid
the
carriage
from
sight
lenormand
finished
his
tacking
in
a
few
seconds
darted
straight
up
the
incline
passed
the
girl
without
stopping
and
turned
round
boldly
he
found
himself
on
a
steep
pebbly
forest
road
which
ran
down
between
dense
woods
and
which
could
only
be
followed
very
slowly
and
with
the
greatest
caution
but
what
did
he
care
twenty
yards
in
front
of
him
the
carriage
a
sort
of
cabriolet
was
dancing
over
the
stones
drawn
or
rather
held
back
by
a
horse
which
knew
enough
only
to
go
very
carefully
feeling
its
way
and
taking
no
risks
there
was
nothing
to
fear
escape
was
impossible
and
the
two
conveyances
went
shaking
and
jolting
at
one
moment
they
were
so
close
together
that
lenormand
thought
of
alighting
and
running
with
his
men
but
he
felt
the
danger
of
putting
on
the
brake
on
so
steep
a
slope
and
he
went
on
pressing
the
enemy
closely
like
a
prey
which
one
keeps
within
sight
within
touch
we
got
him
chief
we
got
him
muttered
the
inspectors
excited
by
the
unexpected
nature
of
the
chase
at
the
bottom
the
way
flattened
out
into
a
road
that
ran
towards
the
seine
towards
bougival
the
horse
on
reaching
level
ground
set
off
at
a
without
hurrying
itself
and
keeping
to
the
middle
of
the
road
a
violent
effort
shook
the
taxi
it
appeared
instead
of
rolling
to
proceed
by
bounds
like
a
darting
fawn
and
slipping
by
the
roadside
slope
ready
to
smash
any
obstacle
it
caught
up
the
carriage
came
level
with
it
passed
it
an
oath
from
lenormand
shouts
of
fury
the
carriage
was
empty
the
carriage
was
empty
the
horse
was
going
along
peacefully
with
the
reins
on
its
back
no
doubt
returning
to
the
stable
of
some
inn
in
the
neighborhood
where
it
had
been
hired
for
the
day
suppressing
his
inward
rage
the
chief
detective
merely
said
the
major
must
have
jumped
out
during
the
few
seconds
when
we
lost
sight
of
the
carriage
at
the
top
of
the
descent
we
have
only
to
beat
the
woods
chief
and
we
are
sure
to
return
the
beggar
is
far
away
by
this
time
he
not
one
of
those
who
are
caught
twice
in
one
day
oh
hang
it
all
hang
it
all
they
went
back
to
the
young
girl
whom
they
found
in
the
company
of
jacques
doudeville
and
apparently
none
the
worse
for
her
adventure
lenormand
introduced
himself
offered
to
take
her
back
home
and
at
once
questioned
her
about
the
english
major
parbury
she
expressed
astonishment
he
is
neither
english
nor
a
major
and
his
name
is
not
parbury
then
what
is
his
name
juan
ribeira
he
is
a
spaniard
sent
by
his
government
to
study
the
working
of
the
french
schools
as
you
please
his
name
and
his
nationality
are
of
no
importance
he
is
the
man
we
are
looking
for
have
you
known
him
long
a
fortnight
or
so
he
had
heard
about
a
school
which
i
have
founded
at
garches
and
he
interested
himself
in
my
experiment
to
the
extent
of
proposing
to
make
me
an
annual
grant
on
the
one
condition
that
he
might
come
from
time
to
time
to
observe
the
progress
of
my
pupils
i
had
not
the
right
to
refuse
no
of
course
not
but
you
should
have
consulted
your
acquaintances
is
not
prince
sernine
a
friend
of
yours
he
is
a
man
of
good
counsel
oh
i
have
the
greatest
confidence
in
him
but
he
is
abroad
at
present
did
you
not
know
his
address
no
and
besides
what
could
i
have
said
to
him
that
gentleman
behaved
very
well
it
was
not
until
but
i
do
know
if
i
beg
you
mademoiselle
speak
frankly
you
can
have
confidence
in
me
also
well
ribeira
came
just
now
he
told
me
that
he
had
been
sent
by
a
french
lady
who
was
paying
a
short
visit
to
bougival
that
this
lady
had
a
little
girl
whose
education
she
would
like
to
entrust
to
me
and
that
she
wished
me
to
come
and
see
her
without
delay
the
thing
seemed
quite
natural
and
as
this
is
a
holiday
and
as
ribeira
had
hired
a
carriage
which
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
end
of
the
road
i
made
no
difficulty
about
accepting
a
seat
in
it
but
what
was
his
object
after
all
she
blushed
and
said
to
carry
me
off
quite
simply
he
confessed
it
to
me
after
half
an
hour
do
you
know
nothing
about
him
no
does
he
live
in
paris
i
suppose
so
has
he
ever
written
to
you
do
you
happen
to
have
a
few
lines
in
his
handwriting
anything
which
he
left
behind
that
may
serve
us
as
a
clue
no
clue
at
all
oh
wait
a
minute
but
i
do
think
that
has
any
importance
speak
speak
please
well
two
days
ago
the
gentleman
asked
permission
to
use
my
typewriting
machine
and
he
typed
out
with
difficulty
for
he
evidently
had
no
practice
a
letter
of
which
i
saw
the
address
by
accident
what
was
the
address
he
was
writing
to
the
and
he
put
about
twenty
stamps
into
the
envelope
yes
the
no
doubt
said
lenormand
i
have
number
with
me
chief
said
gourel
lenormand
unfolded
the
sheet
and
looked
at
the
eighth
page
presently
he
gave
a
start
he
had
read
the
following
sentence
printed
with
the
usual
abbreviation
to
any
person
knowing
steinweg
advertiser
wishes
to
know
if
he
is
in
paris
and
his
address
reply
through
this
column
footnote
personal
advertisements
in
the
french
newspapers
are
charged
by
the
line
not
by
the
word
and
consequently
nearly
every
word
is
clipped
down
to

three
or
four
steinweg
exclaimed
gourel
but
that
the
very
man
whom
dieuzy
is
bringing
to
you
yes
yes
said
lenormand
to
himself
it
the
man
whose
letter
to
kesselbach
i
intercepted
the
man
who
put
kesselbach
on
the
track
of
pierre
leduc
so
they
too
want
particulars
about
pierre
leduc
and
his
past
they
too
are
groping
in
the
dark
he
rubbed
his
hands
steinweg
was
at
his
disposal
in
less
than
an
hour
steinweg
would
have
spoken
in
less
than
an
hour
the
murky
veil
which
oppressed
him
and
which
made
the
kesselbach
case
the
most
agonizing
and
the
most
impenetrable
that
he
had
ever
had
in
hand
that
veil
would
be
torn
asunder
chapter
vi
lenormand
succumbs
lenormand
was
back
in
his
room
at
the
prefecture
of
police
at
six
in
the
evening
he
at
once
sent
for
dieuzy
is
your
man
here
yes
chief
how
far
have
you
got
with
him
not
very
he
wo
speak
a
word
i
told
him
that
by
a
new
regulation
foreigners
were
to
make
a
declaration
at
the
prefecture
as
to
the
object
and
the
probable
length
of
their
stay
in
paris
and
i
brought
him
here
to
your
secretary
office
i
will
question
him
but
at
that
moment
an
appeared
there
a
lady
asking
to
see
you
at
once
chief
have
you
her
card
here
chief
kesselbach
show
her
in
he
walked
across
the
room
to
receive
the
young
widow
at
the
door
and
begged
her
to
take
a
seat
she
still
wore
the
same
disconsolate
look
the
same
appearance
of
illness
and
that
air
of
extreme
lassitude
which
revealed
the
distress
of
her
life
she
held
out
a
copy
of
the
and
pointed
to
the
line
in
the
which
mentioned
steinweg
old
steinweg
was
a
friend
of
my
husband
she
said
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
knows
a
good
many
things
dieuzy
said
lenormand
bring
the
person
who
is
waiting
your
visit
madame
will
not
have
been
useless
i
will
only
ask
you
when
this
person
enters
not
to
say
a
word
the
door
opened
a
man
appeared
an
old
man
with
white
whiskers
meeting
under
his
chin
and
a
face
furrowed
with
deep
wrinkles
poorly
clad
and
wearing
the
hunted
look
of
those
wretches
who
roam
about
the
world
in
search
of
their
daily
pittance
he
stood
on
the
threshold
blinking
his
eyelids
stared
at
lenormand
seemed
confused
by
the
silence
that
greeted
him
on
his
entrance
and
turned
his
hat
in
his
hands
with
embarrassment
but
suddenly
he
appeared
stupefied
his
eyes
opened
wide
and
he
stammered
mrs
kesselbach
he
had
seen
the
young
widow
and
recovering
his
serenity
smiling
losing
his
shyness
he
went
up
to
her
and
in
a
strong
german
accent
oh
i
am
glad
at
last
i
thought
i
should
never
i
was
so
surprised
to
receive
no
news
down
there
no
telegrams
and
how
is
our
dear
rudolf
kesselbach
the
lady
staggered
back
as
though
she
had
been
struck
in
the
face
and
at
once
fell
into
a
chair
and
began
to
sob
what
the
matter
why
what
the
matter
asked
steinweg
lenormand
interposed
i
see
sir
that
you
know
nothing
about
certain
events
that
have
taken
place
recently
have
you
been
long
travelling
yes
three
months
i
had
been
up
to
the
rand
then
i
went
back
to
capetown
and
wrote
to
rudolf
from
there
but
on
my
way
home
by
the
east
coast
route
i
accepted
some
work
at
port
said
rudolf
has
had
my
letter
i
suppose
he
is
away
i
will
explain
the
reason
of
his
absence
but
first
there
is
a
point
on
which
we
should
be
glad
of
some
information
it
has
to
do
with
a
person
whom
you
knew
and
to
whom
you
used
to
refer
in
your
intercourse
with
kesselbach
by
the
name
of
pierre
leduc
pierre
leduc
what
who
told
you
the
old
man
was
utterly
taken
aback
he
spluttered
out
again
who
told
you
who
disclosed
to
you
mr
kesselbach
never
it
was
a
secret
which
i
confided
to
him
and
rudolf
keeps
his
secrets
especially
this
one
nevertheless
it
is
absolutely
necessary
that
you
should
reply
to
our
questions
we
are
at
this
moment
engaged
on
an
inquiry
about
pierre
leduc
which
must
come
to
a
head
without
delay
and
you
alone
can
enlighten
us
as
kesselbach
is
no
longer
here
well
then
cried
steinweg
apparently
making
up
his
mind
what
do
you
want
do
you
know
pierre
leduc
i
have
never
seen
him
but
i
have
long
been
the
possessor
of
a
secret
which
concerns
him
through
a
number
of
incidents
which
i
need
not
relate
and
thanks
to
a
series
of
chances
i
ended
by
acquiring
the
certainty
that
the
man
in
whose
discovery
i
was
interested
was
leading
a
dissolute
life
in
paris
and
that
he
was
calling
himself
pierre
leduc
which
is
not
his
real
name
but
does
he
know
his
real
name
himself
i
presume
so
and
you
yes
i
know
it
well
tell
it
to
us
he
hesitated
then
vehemently
i
ca
he
said
no
i
ca
but
why
not
i
have
no
right
to
the
whole
secret
lies
there
when
i
revealed
the
secret
to
rudolf
he
attached
so
much
importance
to
it
that
he
gave
me
a
large
sum
of
money
to
purchase
my
silence
and
he
promised
me
a
fortune
a
real
fortune
on
the
day
when
he
should
succeed
first
in
finding
pierre
leduc
and
next
in
turning
the
secret
to
account
he
smiled
bitterly
the
large
sum
of
money
is
already
lost
i
came
to
see
how
my
fortune
was
getting
on
kesselbach
is
dead
said
the
chief
detective
steinweg
gave
a
bound
dead
is
it
possible
no
it
a
trap
kesselbach
is
it
true
she
bowed
her
head
he
seemed
crushed
by
this
unexpected
revelation
and
at
the
same
time
it
must
have
been
infinitely
painful
to
him
for
he
began
to
cry
my
poor
rudolf
i
knew
him
when
he
was
a
little
boy
he
used
to
come
and
play
at
my
house
at
augsburg
i
was
very
fond
of
him
and
calling
kesselbach
to
witness
and
he
of
me
was
he
not
kesselbach
he
must
have
told
you
his
old
daddy
steinweg
he
used
to
call
me
lenormand
went
up
to
him
and
in
his
clearest
voice
listen
to
me
he
said
kesselbach
died
murdered
come
be
calm
exclamations
are
of
no
use
he
died
murdered
i
say
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
crime
prove
that
the
culprit
knew
about
the
scheme
in
question
was
there
anything
in
the
nature
of
that
scheme
that
would
enable
you
to
guess
steinweg
stood
dumfounded
he
stammered
it
was
my
fault
if
i
had
not
suggested
the
thing
to
him
kesselbach
went
up
to
him
entreating
him
do
you
think
have
you
any
idea
oh
steinweg
i
implore
you
i
have
no
idea
i
have
not
reflected
he
muttered
i
must
have
time
to
reflect
cast
about
in
kesselbach
surroundings
said
lenormand
did
nobody
take
part
in
your
interviews
at
that
time
was
there
nobody
in
whom
he
himself
could
have
confided
no
think
well
both
the
others
dolores
and
lenormand
leant
toward
him
anxiously
awaiting
his
answer
no
he
said
i
do
see
think
well
repeated
the
chief
detective
the
murderer
christian
name
and
surname
begin
with
an
l
and
an
an
l
he
echoed
i
do
see
an
l
an
yes
the
initials
are
in
gold
on
the
corner
of
a
belonging
to
the
murderer
a
asked
steinweg
making
an
effort
of
memory
a
case
and
one
of
the
compartments
is
divided
into
two
spaces
the
smaller
for
the
other
for
tobacco
two
spaces
two
spaces
repeated
steinweg
whose
thoughts
seemed
stimulated
by
that
detail
could
you
show
it
to
me
here
it
is
or
rather
this
is
an
exact
reproduction
said
lenormand
giving
him
a
eh
what
said
steinweg
taking
the
case
in
his
hands
he
looked
at
it
with
stupid
eyes
examined
it
turned
it
over
in
every
direction
and
suddenly
gave
a
cry
the
cry
of
a
man
struck
with
a
horrible
idea
and
he
stood
like
that
livid
with
trembling
hands
and
wild
staring
eyes
speak
come
speak
said
lenormand
oh
he
said
as
though
blinded
with
light
now
all
is
explained
speak
speak
he
walked
across
to
the
windows
with
a
tottering
step
then
returned
and
rushing
up
to
the
chief
detective
sir
sir
rudolf
murderer
i
tell
you
well
he
stopped
short
well
there
was
a
moment
pause
was
the
name
of
the
odious
criminal
about
to
echo
through
the
great
silence
of
the
office
between
those
walls
which
had
heard
so
many
accusations
so
many
confessions
lenormand
felt
as
if
he
were
on
the
brink
of
the
unfathomable
abyss
and
as
if
a
voice
were
mounting
mounting
up
to
him
a
few
seconds
more
and
he
would
know
no
muttered
steinweg
no
i
ca
what
that
you
say
cried
the
chief
detective
furiously
i
say
that
i
ca
but
you
have
no
right
to
be
silent
the
law
requires
you
to
speak
i
will
speak
i
must
have
time
to
reflect
i
will
tell
you
all
that
i
know
about
pierre
leduc
all
that
i
suppose
about
that
i
promise
you
it
was
obvious
that
he
possessed
that
sort
of
obstinacy
against
which
the
most
energetic
efforts
are
of
no
avail
lenormand
yielded
very
well
i
give
you
until
but
i
warn
you
that
if
you
do
not
speak
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
to
the
he
rang
and
taking
inspector
dieuzy
aside
said
go
with
him
to
his
hotel
and
stay
there
i
send
you
two
men
and
mind
you
keep
your
eyes
about
you
somebody
may
try
to
get
hold
of
him
the
inspector
went
off
with
steinweg
and
lenormand
returning
to
kesselbach
who
had
been
violently
affected
by
this
scene
made
his
excuses
pray
accept
all
my
regrets
madame
i
can
understand
how
upset
you
must
feel
he
questioned
her
as
to
the
period
at
which
kesselbach
renewed
his
relations
with
old
steinweg
and
as
to
the
length
of
time
for
which
those
relations
lasted
but
she
was
so
much
that
he
did
not
insist
am
i
to
come
back
she
asked
no
it
not
necessary
i
will
let
you
know
all
that
steinweg
says
may
i
see
you
down
to
your
carriage
these
three
flights
are
rather
steep
he
opened
the
door
and
stood
back
to
let
her
pass
at
that
moment
shouts
were
heard
in
the
passage
and
people
came
running
up
inspectors
on
duty
clerks
chief
chief
what
the
matter
dieuzy
but
he
just
left
here
he
been
found
on
the
staircase
not
dead
no
stunned
fainting
but
the
man
the
man
who
was
with
him
old
steinweg
he
disappeared
damn
it
he
rushed
along
the
passage
and
down
the
stairs
where
he
found
dieuzy
lying
on
the
landing
surrounded
by
people
who
were
attending
to
him
he
saw
gourel
coming
up
again
oh
gourel
have
you
been
downstairs
did
you
come
across
anybody
no
chief
but
dieuzy
was
recovering
consciousness
and
almost
before
he
had
opened
his
eyes
mumbled
here
on
the
landing
the
little
door
oh
hang
it
the
door
of
court
shouted
the
chief
detective
did
i
say
that
it
was
to
be
kept
locked
it
was
certain
that
sooner
or
later
he
seized
the
oh
of
course
the
door
is
bolted
on
the
other
side
now
footnote
since
lenormand
left
the
detective
service
two
other
criminals
have
escaped
by
the
same
door
after
shaking
off
the
officers
in
charge
of
them
the
police
kept
both
cases
dark
nevertheless
it
would
be
very
easy
if
this
communication
is
absolutely
required
to
remove
the
useless
bolt
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
which
enables
the
fugitive
to
cut
off
all
pursuit
and
to
walk
away
quietly
through
the
passage
leading
to
civil
court
and
through
the
corridor
of
the
chief
president
court
the
door
was
partly
glazed
he
smashed
a
pane
with
the
of
his
revolver
drew
the
bolt
and
said
to
gourel
run
through
this
way
to
the
exit
on
the
place
dauphine
he
went
back
to
dieuzy
come
dieuzy
tell
me
about
it
how
did
you
come
to
let
yourself
be
put
into
this
state
a
blow
in
the
pit
of
the
stomach
chief
a
blow
from
that
old
chap
why
he
can
hardly
stand
on
his
legs
not
the
old
man
chief
but
another
who
was
walking
up
and
down
the
passage
while
steinweg
was
with
you
and
who
followed
us
as
though
he
were
going
out
too
when
we
got
as
far
as
this
he
asked
me
for
a
light
i
looked
for
my
matches
then
he
caught
me
a
punch
in
the
stomach
i
fell
down
and
as
i
fell
i
thought
i
saw
him
open
that
door
and
drag
the
old
man
with
him
would
you
know
him
again
oh
yes
chief
a
powerful
fellow
very
a
southerner
of
sorts
that
certain
ribeira
snarled
lenormand
always
ribeira
ribeira
parbury
oh
the
impudence
of
the
scoundrel
he
was
afraid
of
what
old
steinweg
might
say
and
came
to
fetch
him
away
under
my
very
nose
and
stamping
his
foot
with
anger
but
dash
it
how
did
he
know
that
steinweg
was
here
the
blackguard
it
only
four
hours
since
i
was
chasing
him
in
the
woods
and
now
he
here
how
did
he
know
one
would
think
he
lived
inside
my
skin
he
was
seized
with
one
of
those
fits
of
dreaming
in
which
he
seemed
to
hear
nothing
and
see
nothing
kesselbach
who
passed
at
that
moment
bowed
without
his
replying
but
a
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
corridor
roused
him
from
his
lethargy
at
last
is
that
you
gourel
i
found
out
how
it
was
chief
said
gourel
panting
for
breath
there
were
two
of
them
they
went
this
way
and
out
of
the
place
dauphine
there
was
a
waiting
for
them
there
were
two
people
inside
one
was
a
man
dressed
in
black
with
a
soft
hat
pulled
over
his
eyes
that
he
muttered
lenormand
that
the
murderer
the
accomplice
of
ribeira
parbury
and
who
was
the
other
a
woman
a
woman
without
a
hat
a
it
might
be
and
i
told
with
red
hair
eh
what
you
say
she
had
red
hair
yes
lenormand
turned
round
with
a
bound
ran
down
the
stairs
four
steps
at
a
time
hurried
across
the
courtyard
and
came
out
on
the
quai
des
orfèvres
stop
he
shouted
a
victoria
and
pair
was
driving
off
it
was
kesselbach
carriage
the
coachman
heard
and
pulled
up
his
horses
lenormand
sprang
on
the
step
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
madame
but
i
can
not
do
without
your
assistance
i
will
ask
you
to
let
me
go
with
you
but
we
must
act
swiftly
gourel
where
my
taxi
i
sent
it
away
chief
well
then
get
another
quick
the
men
all
ran
in
different
directions
but
ten
minutes
elapsed
before
one
of
them
returned
with
a
lenormand
was
boiling
with
impatience
kesselbach
standing
on
the
pavement
swayed
from
side
to
side
with
her
in
her
hand
at
last
they
were
seated
gourel
get
up
beside
the
driver
and
go
straight
to
garches
to
my
house
asked
dolores
astounded
he
did
not
reply
he
leant
out
of
the
window
waved
his
pass
explained
who
he
was
to
the
policeman
regulating
the
traffic
in
the
streets
at
last
when
they
reached
the
he
sat
down
again
and
said
i
beseech
you
madame
to
give
me
plain
answers
to
my
questions
did
you
see
mlle
geneviève
ernemont
just
now
at
about
four
geneviève
yes
i
was
dressing
to
go
out
did
she
tell
you
of
the
advertisement
about
steinweg
in
the
she
did
and
it
was
that
which
made
you
come
to
see
me
yes
were
you
alone
during
mlle
ernemont
visit
upon
my
word
i
ca
say
why
recollect
was
one
of
your
servants
present
probably
as
i
was
dressing
what
are
their
names
suzanne
and
gertrude
one
of
them
has
red
hair
has
she
not
yes
gertrude
have
you
known
her
long
her
sister
has
always
been
with
me
and
so
has
gertrude
for
years
she
is
devotion
and
honesty
personified
in
short
you
will
answer
for
her
oh
absolutely
very
well
very
well
it
was
seven
and
the
daylight
was
beginning
to
wane
when
the
reached
the
house
of
retreat
without
troubling
about
his
companion
the
chief
detective
rushed
into
the
porter
lodge
kesselbach
maid
has
just
come
in
has
she
not
whom
do
you
mean
the
maid
why
gertrude
one
of
the
two
sisters
but
gertrude
ca
have
been
out
sir
we
have
seen
her
go
out
still
some
one
has
just
come
in
no
sir
we
have
opened
the
door
to
anybody
since
let
me
see
six
this
evening
is
there
no
other
way
out
than
this
gate
no
the
walls
surround
the
estate
on
every
side
and
they
are
very
high
kesselbach
we
will
go
to
your
house
please
they
all
three
went
kesselbach
who
had
no
key
rang
the
door
was
answered
by
suzanne
the
other
sister
is
gertrude
in
asked
kesselbach
yes
in
her
room
send
her
down
please
said
the
chief
detective
after
a
moment
gertrude
came
downstairs
looking
very
attractive
and
engaging
in
her
white
embroidered
apron
she
had
in
point
of
fact
a
rather
pretty
face
crowned
with
red
hair
lenormand
looked
at
her
for
a
long
time
without
speaking
as
though
he
were
trying
to
read
what
lay
behind
those
innocent
eyes
he
asked
her
no
questions
after
a
minute
he
simply
said
that
will
do
thank
you
come
gourel
he
went
out
with
the
sergeant
and
at
once
as
they
followed
the
darkling
paths
of
the
garden
said
that
the
one
do
you
think
so
chief
she
looked
so
placid
much
too
placid
another
would
have
been
astonished
would
have
wanted
to
know
why
i
sent
for
her
not
this
one
nothing
but
the
concentrated
effort
of
a
face
that
is
determined
to
smile
at
all
costs
only
i
saw
a
drop
of
perspiration
trickle
from
her
temple
along
her
ear
so
that
so
that
everything
becomes
plain
gertrude
is
in
league
with
the
two
ruffians
who
are
conspiring
round
the
kesselbach
case
in
order
either
to
discover
and
carry
out
the
famous
scheme
or
to
capture
the
millions
no
doubt
the
other
sister
is
in
the
plot
as
well
at
four
gertrude
learning
that
i
know
of
the
advertisement
in
the
takes
advantage
of
her
mistress
absence
hastens
to
paris
finds
ribeira
and
the
man
in
the
soft
hat
and
drags
them
off
to
the
palais
where
ribeira
annexes
master
steinweg
for
his
own
purposes
he
reflected
and
concluded
all
this
proves
first
the
importance
which
they
attach
to
steinweg
and
their
fear
of
what
he
may
reveal
secondly
that
a
regular
plot
is
being
hatched
around
kesselbach
thirdly
that
i
have
no
time
to
lose
for
the
plot
is
ripe
very
well
said
gourel
but
one
thing
remains
unexplained
how
was
gertrude
able
to
leave
the
garden
in
which
we
now
are
and
to
enter
it
again
unknown
to
the
porter
and
his
wife
through
a
secret
passage
which
the
rogues
must
have
contrived
to
make
quite
recently
and
which
would
end
no
doubt
said
gourel
in
house
yes
perhaps
said
lenormand
perhaps
but
i
have
another
idea
they
followed
the
circuit
of
the
wall
it
was
a
bright
night
and
though
their
two
forms
were
hardly
distinguishable
they
themselves
could
see
enough
to
examine
the
stones
of
the
walls
and
to
convince
themselves
that
no
breach
however
skilful
had
been
effected
a
ladder
very
likely
suggested
gourel
no
because
gertrude
is
able
to
get
out
in
broad
daylight
a
communication
of
the
kind
i
mean
can
evidently
not
end
out
of
doors
the
entrance
must
be
concealed
by
some
building
already
in
existence
there
are
only
the
four
objected
gourel
and
they
are
all
inhabited
i
beg
your
pardon
the
third
the
pavillon
hortense
is
not
inhabited
who
told
you
so
the
porter
kesselbach
hired
this
house
which
is
near
her
own
for
fear
of
the
noise
who
knows
but
that
in
so
doing
she
acted
under
gertrude
influence
he
walked
round
the
house
in
question
the
shutters
were
closed
he
lifted
the
latch
of
the
door
on
the
the
door
opened
ah
gourel
i
think
we
struck
it
let
go
in
light
your
lantern
oh
the
hall
the
the
that
no
use
there
must
be
a
basement
as
the
kitchen
is
not
on
this
floor
this
way
chief
the
are
here
they
went
down
into
a
rather
large
kitchen
crammed
full
of
and
beside
it
was
a
which
also
served
as
a
cellar
and
which
presented
the
same
untidy
sight
of
objects
piled
one
on
the
top
of
the
other
what
is
that
shiny
thing
down
there
chief
gourel
stooped
and
picked
up
a
brass
pin
with
a
head
made
of
an
imitation
pearl
the
pearl
is
quite
bright
still
said
lenormand
which
it
would
not
be
if
it
had
been
lying
in
this
cellar
long
gertrude
passed
this
way
gourel
gourel
began
to
demolish
a
great
stack
of
empty
writing
desks
and
old
rickety
tables
you
are
wasting
your
time
said
lenormand
if
that
is
the
way
out
how
would
she
have
time
first
to
move
all
those
things
and
then
to
replace
them
behind
her
look
here
is
a
shutter
out
of
use
which
has
no
valid
reason
for
being
fastened
to
the
wall
by
that
nail
draw
it
back
gourel
did
so
behind
the
shutter
the
wall
was
hollowed
out
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
they
saw
an
underground
passage
running
downwards
i
was
right
said
the
communication
is
of
recent
date
you
see
it
a
piece
of
work
hurriedly
done
and
not
intended
to
last
for
any
length
of
time
no
masonry
two
planks
placed
at
intervals
with
a
joist
to
serve
as
a
roof
and
that
is
all
it
will
hold
up
as
best
it
may
well
enough
in
any
case
for
the
object
in
view
that
is
to
say
that
is
to
say
what
chief
well
first
to
allow
of
the
going
backwards
and
forwards
between
gertrude
and
her
accomplices
and
then
one
day
one
day
soon
of
the
kidnapping
or
rather
the
total
miraculous
incomprehensible
disappearance
of
mrs
kesselbach
they
proceeded
cautiously
so
as
not
to
knock
against
certain
beams
which
did
not
look
it
at
once
became
evident
that
the
tunnel
was
much
longer
than
the
fifty
yards
at
most
that
separated
the
house
from
the
boundary
of
the
garden
it
must
therefore
end
at
a
fair
distance
from
the
walls
and
beyond
the
road
that
skirted
the
property
we
are
not
going
in
the
direction
of
villeneuve
and
the
lake
are
we
asked
gourel
not
at
all
the
other
way
about
declared
lenormand
the
tunnel
descended
with
a
gentle
slope
there
was
a
step
then
another
and
they
veered
toward
the
right
they
at
once
knocked
up
against
a
door
which
was
fitted
into
a
rubble
frame
carefully
cemented
lenormand
pushed
it
and
it
opened
one
second
gourel
he
said
stopping
let
us
think
it
might
perhaps
be
wiser
to
turn
back
why
we
must
reflect
that
ribeira
will
have
foreseen
the
danger
and
presume
that
he
has
taken
his
precautions
in
case
the
underground
passage
should
be
discovered
now
he
knows
that
we
are
on
his
track
he
knows
that
we
are
searching
the
garden
he
no
doubt
saw
us
enter
the
house
how
do
i
know
that
he
is
not
at
this
moment
laying
a
trap
for
us
there
are
two
of
us
chief
and
suppose
there
were
twenty
of
them
he
looked
in
front
of
him
the
tunnel
sloped
upward
again
closed
by
another
door
which
was
at
five
or
six
yards
distance
let
us
go
so
far
he
said
then
we
shall
see
he
passed
through
followed
by
gourel
whom
he
told
to
leave
the
first
door
open
and
walked
to
the
other
door
resolving
within
himself
to
go
no
farther
but
this
second
door
was
shut
and
though
the
lock
seemed
to
work
he
could
not
succeed
in
opening
it
the
door
is
bolted
he
said
let
us
make
no
noise
and
go
back
the
more
so
as
outside
by
remembering
the
position
of
the
tunnel
we
can
fix
the
line
along
which
to
look
for
the
other
outlet
they
therefore
retraced
their
steps
to
the
first
door
when
gourel
who
was
walking
ahead
gave
an
exclamation
of
surprise
why
it
closed
how
is
that
when
i
told
you
to
leave
it
open
i
did
leave
it
open
chief
but
the
door
must
have
fallen
back
of
its
own
weight
impossible
we
should
have
heard
the
sound
then
then
then
i
do
know
he
went
up
to
the
door
let
see
there
a
key
does
it
turn
yes
it
turns
but
there
seems
to
be
a
bolt
on
the
other
side
who
can
have
fastened
it
they
of
course
behind
our
backs
perhaps
they
have
another
tunnel
that
runs
above
this
one
alongside
of
it
or
else
they
were
waiting
in
that
empty
house
in
any
case
we
caught
in
a
trap
he
grew
angry
with
the
lock
thrust
his
knife
into
the
chink
of
the
door
tried
every
means
and
then
in
a
moment
of
weariness
said
there
nothing
to
be
done
what
chief
nothing
to
be
done
in
that
case
we
diddled
i
dare
say
said
lenormand
they
returned
to
the
other
door
and
came
back
again
to
the
first
both
were
solid
made
of
hard
wood
strengthened
with
in
short
indestructible
we
should
want
a
hatchet
said
the
chief
of
the
or
at
the
very
least
a
serious
implement
a
knife
even
with
which
we
might
try
to
cut
away
the
place
where
the
bolt
is
most
likely
to
be
and
we
have
nothing
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
rage
and
flung
himself
upon
the
obstacle
as
though
he
hoped
to
do
away
with
it
then
powerless
beaten
he
said
to
gourel
listen
we
look
into
this
in
an
hour
or
two
i
am
tired
out
i
am
going
to
sleep
keep
watch
so
long
and
if
they
come
and
attack
us
ah
if
they
come
we
shall
be
saved
chief
cried
gourel
who
would
have
been
relieved
by
a
fight
however
great
the
odds
lenormand
lay
down
on
the
ground
in
a
minute
he
was
asleep
when
he
woke
up
he
remained
for
some
seconds
undecided
not
understanding
and
he
also
asked
himself
what
sort
of
pain
it
was
that
was
tormenting
him
gourel
he
called
come
gourel
obtaining
no
reply
he
pressed
the
spring
of
his
lantern
and
saw
gourel
lying
beside
him
sound
asleep
what
on
earth
can
this
pain
be
he
thought
regular
twitchings
oh
why
of
course
i
am
hungry
that
all
i
starving
what
can
the
time
be
his
watch
marked
twenty
minutes
past
seven
but
he
remembered
that
he
had
not
wound
it
up
gourel
watch
was
not
going
either
gourel
had
awoke
under
the
action
of
the
same
inward
pangs
which
made
them
think
that
the
must
be
long
past
and
that
they
had
already
slept
for
a
part
of
the
day
my
legs
are
quite
numbed
said
gourel
and
my
feet
feel
as
if
they
were
on
ice
what
a
funny
sensation
he
bent
down
to
rub
them
and
went
on
why
it
not
on
ice
that
my
feet
were
but
in
water
look
chief
there
a
regular
pool
near
the
first
door
soaked
through
lenormand
replied
we
go
back
to
the
second
door
you
can
dry
yourself
but
what
are
you
doing
chief
do
you
think
i
am
going
to
allow
myself
to
be
buried
alive
in
this
vault
not
if
i
know
it
i
have
reached
the
age
as
the
two
doors
are
closed
let
us
try
to
pass
through
the
walls
one
by
one
he
loosened
the
stones
that
stood
out
at
the
height
of
his
hand
in
the
hope
of
contriving
another
gallery
that
would
slope
upwards
to
the
level
of
the
soil
but
the
work
was
long
and
painful
for
in
this
part
of
the
tunnel
as
he
perceived
the
stones
were
cemented
chief
chief
stammered
gourel
in
a
stifled
voice
well
you
are
standing
with
your
feet
in
the
water
nonsense
why
so
i
am
well
it
ca
be
helped
i
dry
them
in
the
sun
but
do
you
see
what
why
it
rising
chief
it
rising
what
rising
the
water
lenormand
felt
a
shudder
pass
over
his
skin
he
suddenly
understood
it
was
not
a
casual
trickling
through
as
he
had
thought
but
a
flood
mechanically
irresistibly
produced
by
some
infernal
system
oh
the
scoundrel
he
snarled
if
ever
i
lay
hands
on
him
yes
yes
chief
but
we
must
first
get
out
of
this
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
gourel
seemed
completely
prostrated
incapable
of
having
an
idea
of
proposing
a
plan
lenormand
knelt
down
on
the
ground
and
measured
the
rate
at
which
the
water
was
rising
a
quarter
or
thereabouts
of
the
first
door
was
covered
and
the
water
was
toward
the
second
door
the
progress
is
slow
but
uninterrupted
he
said
in
a
few
hours
it
will
be
over
our
heads
but
this
is
terrible
chief
it
horrible
moaned
gourel
oh
look
here
do
come
boring
me
with
your
lamentations
do
you
understand
cry
if
it
amuses
you
but
do
let
me
hear
you
it
the
hunger
that
weakens
me
chief
my
brain
going
round
bite
your
fist
as
gourel
said
the
position
was
terrible
and
if
lenormand
had
had
less
energy
he
would
have
abandoned
the
vain
struggle
what
was
to
be
done
it
was
no
use
hoping
that
ribeira
would
have
the
charity
to
let
them
out
it
was
no
use
either
hoping
that
the
brothers
doudeville
would
rescue
them
for
the
inspectors
did
not
know
of
the
existence
of
the
tunnel
so
no
hope
remained
no
hope
but
that
of
an
impossible
miracle
come
come
said
lenormand
this
is
too
silly
we
not
going
to
kick
the
bucket
here
hang
it
all
there
must
be
something
show
me
a
light
gourel
flattening
himself
against
the
second
door
he
examined
it
from
top
to
bottom
in
every
corner
there
was
an
enormous
bolt
on
that
side
just
as
there
probably
was
on
the
other
he
unfastened
the
screws
with
the
blade
of
his
knife
and
the
bolt
came
off
in
his
hand
and
what
next
asked
gourel
what
next
he
echoed
well
this
bolt
is
made
of
iron
pretty
long
and
very
nearly
pointed
certainly
it
not
as
good
as
a
but
it
better
than
nothing
and
without
finishing
his
sentence
he
drove
the
implement
into
the
of
the
tunnel
a
little
in
front
of
the
pillar
of
masonry
that
supported
the
hinges
of
the
door
as
he
expected
once
he
had
passed
the
first
layer
of
cement
and
stones
he
found
soft
earth
to
work
he
cried
certainly
chief
but
would
you
explain
it
quite
simple
i
want
to
dig
round
this
pillar
a
passage
three
or
four
yards
long
which
will
join
the
tunnel
on
the
other
side
of
the
door
and
allow
us
to
escape
but
it
will
take
us
hours
and
meanwhile
the
water
is
rising
show
me
a
light
gourel
in
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
at
most
it
will
have
reached
our
feet
show
me
a
light
gourel
lenormand
idea
was
correct
and
with
some
little
exertion
by
pulling
the
earth
which
he
first
loosened
with
his
implement
towards
him
and
making
it
fall
into
the
tunnel
he
was
not
long
in
digging
a
hole
large
enough
to
slip
into
it
my
turn
chief
said
gourel
aha
you
returning
to
life
i
see
well
fire
away
you
have
only
to
follow
the
shape
of
the
pillar
at
that
moment
the
water
was
up
to
their
ankles
would
they
have
time
to
complete
the
work
begun
it
became
more
difficult
as
they
went
on
for
the
earth
which
they
disturbed
was
in
their
way
and
lying
flat
on
their
stomachs
in
the
passage
they
were
obliged
at
every
instant
to
remove
the
rubbish
that
obstructed
them
after
two
hours
the
work
was
perhaps
through
but
the
water
now
covered
their
legs
another
hour
and
it
would
reach
the
opening
of
the
hole
which
they
were
digging
and
that
would
mean
the
end
gourel
who
was
exhausted
by
the
want
of
food
and
who
was
too
stout
to
move
with
any
freedom
in
that
passage
had
had
to
give
up
he
no
longer
stirred
trembling
with
anguish
at
feeling
that
icy
water
which
was
gradually
swallowing
him
up
as
for
lenormand
he
worked
on
with
indefatigable
ardor
it
was
a
terrible
job
this
ants
work
performed
in
the
stifling
darkness
his
hands
were
bleeding
he
was
fainting
with
hunger
the
insufficiency
of
the
air
hampered
his
breathing
and
from
time
to
time
gourel
sighs
reminded
him
of
the
awful
danger
that
threatened
him
at
the
bottom
of
his
hole
but
nothing
could
discourage
him
for
now
he
again
found
opposite
him
those
cemented
stones
which
formed
the
of
the
gallery
it
was
the
most
difficult
part
but
the
end
was
at
hand
it
rising
cried
gourel
in
a
choking
voice
it
rising
lenormand
redoubled
his
efforts
suddenly
the
stem
of
the
bolt
which
he
was
using
leapt
out
into
space
the
passage
was
dug
he
had
now
only
to
widen
it
which
became
much
easier
once
he
was
able
to
shoot
the
materials
in
front
of
him
gourel
mad
with
terror
was
howling
like
a
dying
beast
lenormand
paid
no
attention
to
him
safety
was
at
hand
nevertheless
he
had
a
few
seconds
of
anxiety
when
he
perceived
by
the
sound
of
the
materials
falling
that
this
part
of
the
tunnel
was
also
under
water
which
was
natural
as
the
door
did
not
form
a
sufficiently
barrier
but
what
did
it
matter
the
outlet
was
free
one
last
effort
he
passed
through
come
gourel
he
cried
returning
to
fetch
his
companion
he
dragged
him
half
dead
by
the
wrists
come
along
booby
pull
yourself
together
we
are
saved
do
you
really
think
so
chief
the
water
up
to
our
chests
never
mind
as
long
as
it
not
over
our
mouths
where
your
lantern
it
not
working
no
matter
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
delight
one
step
two
steps
a
staircase
at
last
they
emerged
from
the
water
that
accursed
water
which
had
almost
swallowed
them
up
and
it
was
a
delicious
sensation
a
release
that
sent
up
their
spirits
stop
said
lenormand
his
head
had
knocked
against
something
with
arms
outstretched
he
pushed
against
the
obstacle
which
yielded
at
once
it
was
the
flap
of
a
and
when
this
was
opened
he
found
himself
in
a
cellar
into
which
the
light
of
a
fine
night
filtered
through
an
he
threw
back
the
flap
and
climbed
the
last
treads
then
a
veil
fell
over
his
eyes
arms
seized
upon
him
he
felt
himself
as
it
were
wrapped
in
a
sheet
in
a
sort
of
sack
and
then
fastened
with
cords
now
for
the
other
one
said
a
voice
the
same
operation
must
have
been
performed
on
gourel
and
the
same
voice
said
if
they
call
out
kill
them
at
once
have
you
your
dagger
yes
come
along
you
two
take
this
one
you
two
that
one
no
light
and
no
noise
either
it
would
be
a
serious
matter
they

searching
the
garden

since
this
morning
there
are
ten
or
fifteen
of
them
knocking
about
go
back
to
the
house

and
if
the
least
thing
happens
telephone
to
me
in
paris
lenormand
felt
that
he
was
being
lifted
up
and
carried
and
a
moment
after
that
he
was
in
the
open
air
bring
the
cart
nearer
said
a
voice
lenormand
heard
the
sound
of
a
horse
and
cart
he
was
laid
out
on
some
boards
gourel
was
hoisted
up
beside
him
the
horse
started
at
a
trot
the
drive
lasted
about
half
an
hour
halt
commanded
the
voice

no
time

right
well
here
wishing
you
a
pleasant
journey
m
lenormand
lenormand
was
placed
on
the
parapet
someone
gave
him
a
push
he
felt
himself
falling
into
space
and
he
still
heard
the
voice
chuckling
a
pleasant
journey
ten
seconds
later
it
was
sergeant
gourel
turn
chapter
vii
the

and
parlor

before
a
and
began

stranger
in
the
room

turned

alarm

cried

whom
she
introduced
him
as
you

she
must
only
i
may
as
well

i
do
think
much
of

pierre

good
fellow

her
own
class
of

what
they
think

will
go
into
the
question
whether
the
knight
pierre
leduc
and
the
queen
geneviève
have
a
heart
or
not
she
interrupted
him
did
you
hear
a
whistle
it
the
two
doudevilles
go
and
bring
them
in
and
then
leave
us
as
soon
as
the
two
brothers
were
in
the
room
he
questioned
them
with
his
usual
precision
i
know
what
the
newspapers
have
said
about
the
disappearance
of
lenormand
and
gourel
do
you
know
any
more
no
the
weber
has
taken
the
case
in
hand
we
have
been
searching
the
garden
of
the
house
of
retreat
for
the
past
week
and
nobody
is
able
to
explain
how
they
can
have
disappeared
the
whole
force
is
in
a
flutter
no
one
has
ever
seen
the
like
a
chief
of
the
disappearing
without
leaving
a
trace
behind
him
the
two
maids
gertrude
has
gone
she
is
being
looked
for
her
sister
suzanne
weber
and
formerie
have
questioned
her
there
is
nothing
against
her
is
that
all
you
have
to
tell
me
oh
no
there
are
other
things
all
the
things
which
we
did
not
tell
the
papers
they
then
described
the
incidents
that
had
marked
lenormand
last
two
days
the
night
visit
of
the
two
ruffians
to
pierre
leduc
villa
next

about
the
steinweg
incident
he
told
us
of
it
and
they
still
trust
you
at
the
prefecture
of
police
so
much
so
that
they
employ
us
openly
weber
swears
by
us
come
said
the
prince
all
is
not
lost
if
lenormand
has
committed
an
imprudence
that
has
cost
him
his
life
as
i
suppose
he
did
at
any
rate
he
performed
some
good
work
first
and
we
have
only
to
continue
it
the
enemy
has
the
start
of
us
but
we
will
catch
him
up
it
wo
be
an
easy
job
governor
why
not
it
is
only
a
matter
of
finding
old
steinweg
again
for
the
answer
to
the
riddle
is
in
his
hands
yes
but
where
has
ribeira
got
old
steinweg
tucked
away
at
his
own
place
of
course
then
we
should
have
to
know
where
ribeira
hangs
out
well
of
course
he
dismissed
them
and
went
to
the
house
of
retreat
were
awaiting
outside
the
door
and
two
men
were
walking
up
and
down
as
though
mounting
guard
in
the
garden
near
kesselbach
house
he
saw
geneviève
sitting
on
a
bench
with
pierre
leduc
and
a
gentleman
wearing
a
single
the
three
were
talking
and
none
of
them
saw
him
but
several
people
came
out
of
the
house
formerie
weber
a
clerk
and
two
inspectors
geneviève
went
indoors
and
the
gentleman
with
the
went
up
and
spoke
to
the
and
the
of
the
and
walked
away
with
them
slowly
sernine
came
beside
the
bench
where
pierre
leduc
was
sitting
and
whispered
do
move
pierre
leduc
it
i
you
you
it
was
the
third
time
that
the
young
man
saw
sernine
since
the
awful
night
at
versailles
and
each
time
it
upset
him
tell
me
who
is
the
fellow
with
the
pierre
leduc
turned
pale
and
jabbered
sernine
pinched
his
arm
answer
me
confound
it
who
is
he
baron
altenheim
where
does
he
come
from
he
was
a
friend
of
kesselbach
he
arrived
from
austria
six
days
ago
and
placed
himself
at
kesselbach
disposal
the
police
authorities
had
meanwhile
gone
out
of
the
garden
baron
altenheim
also
the
prince
rose
and
turning
towards
the
pavillon
de
continued
has
the
baron
asked
you
many
questions
yes
a
great
many
he
is
interested
in
my
case
he
wants
to
help
me
find
my
family
he
appealed
to
my
childhood
memories
and
what
did
you
say
nothing
because
i
know
nothing
what
memories
have
i
you
put
me
in
another
place
and
i
do
even
know
who
that
other
is
no
more
do
i
chuckled
the
prince
and
that
just
what
makes
your
case
so
quaint
oh
it
all
very
well
for
you
to
laugh
you
always
laughing
but
i
beginning
to
have
enough
of
it
i
mixed
up
in
a
heap
of
nasty
matters
to
say
nothing
of
the
danger
which
i
run
in
pretending
to
be
somebody
that
i
am
not
what
do
you
mean
that
you
are
not
you
quite
as
much
a
duke
as
i
am
a
prince
perhaps
even
more
so
besides
if
you
not
a
duke
hurry
up
and
become
one
hang
it
all
geneviève
ca
marry
any
one
but
a
duke
look
at
her
is
she
worth
selling
your
soul
for
he
did
not
even
look
at
leduc
not
caring
what
he
thought
they
had
reached
the
house
by
this
time
and
geneviève
appeared
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
comely
and
smiling
so
you
have
returned
she
said
to
the
prince
ah
that
a
good
thing
i
am
so
glad
do
you
want
to
see
dolores
after
a
moment
she
showed
him
into
kesselbach
room
the
prince
was
taken
aback
dolores
was
paler
still
and
thinner
than
on
the
day
when
he
saw
her
last
lying
on
a
sofa
wrapped
up
in
white
stuffs
she
looked
like
one
of
those
sick
people
who
have
ceased
to
struggle
against
death
as
for
her
she
had
ceased
to
struggle
against
life
against
the
fate
that
was
overwhelming
her
with
its
blows
sernine
gazed
at
her
with
deep
pity
and
with
an
emotion
which
he
did
not
strive
to
conceal
she
thanked
him
for
the
sympathy
which
he
showed
her
she
also
spoke
of
baron
altenheim
in
friendly
terms
did
you
know
him
before
he
asked
yes
by
name
and
through
his
intimacy
with
my
husband
i
have
met
an
altenheim
who
lives
in
the
rue
de
rivoli
do
you
think
it
the
same
oh
no
this
one
lives
in
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
quite
know
he
gave
me
his
address
but
i
ca
say
that
i
remember
it
after
a
few
minutes
conversation
sernine
took
his
leave
geneviève
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
hall
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
said
eagerly
on
a
serious
matter
did
you
see
him
whom
baron
altenheim
but
that
not
his
name
or
at
least
he
has
another
i
recognized
him
he
does
not
know
it
she
dragged
him
out
of
doors
and
walked
on
in
great
excitement
calm
yourself
geneviève
he
the
man
who
tried
to
carry
me
off
but
for
that
poor
lenormand
i
should
have
been
done
for
come
you
must
know
for
you
know
everything
then
his
real
name
is
ribeira
are
you
sure
it
was
no
use
his
changing
his
appearance
his
accent
his
manner
i
knew
him
at
once
by
the
horror
with
which
he
inspires
me
but
i
said
nothing
until
you
returned
you
said
nothing
to
kesselbach
either
no
she
seemed
so
happy
at
meeting
a
friend
of
her
husband
but
you
will
speak
to
her
about
it
will
you
not
you
will
protect
her
i
do
know
what
he
is
preparing
against
her
against
myself
now
that
lenormand
is
no
longer
there
he
has
nothing
to
fear
he
does
as
he
pleases
who
can
unmask
him
i
can
i
will
be
responsible
for
everything
but
not
a
word
to
anybody
they
had
reached
the
porter
lodge
the
gate
was
opened
the
prince
said
geneviève
and
be
quite
easy
in
your
mind
i
am
there
he
shut
the
gate
turned
round
and
gave
a
slight
start
opposite
him
stood
the
man
with
the
baron
altenheim
with
his
head
held
well
up
his
broad
shoulders
his
powerful
frame
they
looked
at
each
other
for
two
or
three
seconds
in
silence
the
baron
smiled
then
the
baron
said
i
was
waiting
for
you
lupin
for
all
his
sernine
felt
a
thrill
pass
over
him
he
had
come
to
unmask
his
adversary
and
his
adversary
had
unmasked
him
at
the
first
onset
and
at
the
same
time
the
adversary
was
accepting
the
contest
boldly
brazenly
as
though
he
felt
sure
of
victory
it
was
a
swaggering
thing
to
do
and
gave
evidence
of
no
small
amount
of
pluck
the
two
men
violently
hostile
one
to
the
other
took
each
measure
with
their
eyes
and
what
then
asked
sernine
what
then
do
you
think
we
have
occasion
for
a
meeting
why
i
want
to
talk
to
you
what
day
will
suit
you
let
us
lunch
together
at
a
restaurant
why
not
at
your
place
you
do
know
my
address
yes
i
do
with
a
swift
movement
the
prince
pulled
out
a
newspaper
protruding
from
altenheim
pocket
a
paper
still
in
its
addressed
wrapper
and
said
no
villa
dupont
well
played
said
the
other
then
we
say
at
my
place
at
your
place
at
what
time
one
i
shall
be
there
they
were
about
to
walk
away
altenheim
stopped
oh
one
word
more
prince
bring
a
weapon
with
you
why
i
keep
four
and
you
will
be
alone
i
have
my
fists
said
sernine
we
shall
be
on
even
terms
he
turned
his
back
on
him
and
then
calling
him
back
oh
one
word
more
baron
engage
four
more
servants
why
i
have
thought
it
over
i
shall
bring
my
whip
at
one
the
next
day
precisely
a
horseman
rode
through
the
gate
of
the
villa
dupont
a
peaceful
countrified
private
road
the
only
entrance
to
which
is
in
the
rue
pergolèse
close
to
the
avenue
du
bois
it
is
lined
with
gardens
and
handsome
private
houses
and
right
at
the
end
it
is
closed
by
a
sort
of
little
park
containing
a
large
old
house
behind
which
runs
the
paris
circular
railway
it
was
here
at
no
that
baron
altenheim
lived
sernine
flung
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
a
groom
whom
he
had
sent
on
ahead
and
said
bring
him
back
at
two
he
rang
the
bell
the
opened
and
he
walked
to
the
steps
where
he
was
awaited
by
two
tall
men
in
livery
who
ushered
him
into
an
immense
cold
stone
hall
devoid
of
any
ornament
the
door
closed
behind
him
with
a
heavy
thud
and
great
and
indomitable
as
his
courage
was
he
nevertheless
underwent
an
unpleasant
sensation
at
feeling
himself
alone
surrounded
by
enemies
in
that
isolated
prison
say
prince
sernine
the
was
near
and
he
was
shown
straight
in
ah
there
you
are
my
dear
prince
said
the
baron
coming
toward
him
well
will
you
believe
dominique
lunch
in
twenty
minutes
until
then
do
let
us
be
interrupted
will
you
believe
my
dear
prince
that
i
hardly
expected
to
see
you
oh
really
why
well
your
declaration
of
war
this
morning
is
so
plain
that
an
interview
becomes
superfluous
my
declaration
of
war
the
baron
unfolded
a
copy
of
the
and
pointed
to
a
paragraph
which
ran
as
follows
we
are
authoritatively
informed
that
disappearance
has
roused
arsène
lupin
into
taking
action
after
a
brief
enquiry
and
following
on
his
proposal
to
clear
up
the
kesselbach
case
arsène
lupin
has
decided
that
he
will
find
lenormand
alive
or
dead
and
that
he
will
deliver
the
author
or
authors
of
that
heinous
series
of
crimes
to
justice
this
authoritative
pronouncement
comes
from
you
my
dear
prince
of
course
yes
it
comes
from
me
therefore
i
was
right
it
means
war
yes
altenheim
gave
sernine
a
chair
sat
down
himself
and
said
in
a
conciliatory
tone
well
no
i
can
not
allow
that
it
is
impossible
that
two
men
like
ourselves
should
fight
and
injure
each
other
we
have
only
to
come
to
an
explanation
to
seek
the
means
you
and
i
were
made
to
understand
each
other
i
think
on
the
contrary
that
two
men
like
ourselves
are
not
made
to
understand
each
other
the
baron
suppressed
a
movement
of
impatience
and
continued
listen
to
me
lupin
by
the
way
do
you
mind
my
calling
you
lupin
what
shall
i
call
you
altenheim
ribeira
or
parbury
oho
i
see
that
you
are
even
better
posted
than
i
thought
hang
it
all
but
you
jolly
smart
all
the
more
reason
why
we
should
agree
and
bending
toward
him
listen
lupin
and
ponder
my
words
well
i
have
weighed
them
carefully
every
one
look
here
we
two
are
evenly
matched
does
that
make
you
smile
you
are
wrong
it
may
be
that
you
possess
resources
which
i
do
not
but
i
have
others
of
which
you
know
nothing
moreover
as
you
are
aware
i
have
few
scruples
some
skill
and
a
capacity
for
changing
my
personality
which
an
expert
like
yourself
ought
to
appreciate
in
short
the
two
adversaries
are
each
as
good
as
the
other
but
one
question
remains
unanswered
why
are
we
adversaries
we
are
pursuing
the
same
object
you
will
say
and
what
then
do
you
know
what
will
come
of
our
rivalry
each
of
us
will
paralyze
the
efforts
and
destroy
the
work
of
the
other
and
we
shall
both
miss
our
aim
and
for
whose
benefit
some
lenormand
or
other
a
third
rogue
it
really
too
silly
it
really
too
silly
as
you
say
sernine
admitted
but
there
is
a
remedy
what
is
that
for
you
to
withdraw
do
chaff
i
am
serious
the
proposal
which
i
am
going
to
make
is
not
one
to
be
rejected
without
examination
here
it
is
in
two
words
be
partners
i
say
of
course
each
of
us
will
continue
free
where
his
own
affairs
are
concerned
but
for
the
business
in
question
let
us
combine
our
efforts
does
that
suit
you
hand
in
hand
and
share
alike
what
do
you
bring
i
yes
you
know
what
i
worth
i
delivered
my
proofs
in
the
alliance
which
you
are
proposing
you
know
the
figure
so
to
speak
of
my
what
yours
steinweg
that
not
much
it
immense
through
steinweg
we
learn
the
truth
about
pierre
leduc
through
steinweg
we
get
to
know
what
the
famous
kesselbach
plan
is
all
about
sernine
burst
out
laughing
and
you
need
me
for
that
i
do
understand
come
old
chap
your
offer
is
childish
you
have
steinweg
in
your
hands
if
you
wish
for
my
collaboration
it
is
because
you
have
not
succeeded
in
making
him
speak
but
for
that
fact
you
would
do
without
my
services
well
what
of
it
i
refuse
the
two
men
stood
up
to
each
other
once
more
violent
and
implacable
i
refuse
said
sernine
lupin
requires
nobody
in
order
to
act
i
am
one
of
those
who
walk
alone
if
you
were
my
equal
as
you
pretend
the
idea
of
a
partnership
would
never
have
entered
your
head
the
man
who
has
the
stature
of
a
leader
commands
union
implies
obedience
i
do
not
obey
you
refuse
you
refuse
repeated
altenheim
turning
pale
under
the
insult
all
that
i
can
do
for
you
old
chap
is
to
offer
you
a
place
in
my
band
you
be
a
private
soldier
to
begin
with
under
my
orders
you
shall
see
how
a
general
wins
a
battle
and
how
he
pockets
the
booty
by
himself
and
for
himself
does
that
suit
you
tommy
altenheim
was
beside
himself
with
fury
he
gnashed
his
teeth
you
are
making
a
mistake
lupin
he
mumbled
you
are
making
a
mistake
i
do
want
anybody
either
and
this
business
gives
me
no
more
difficulty
than
plenty
of
others
which
i
have
pulled
off
what
i
said
was
said
in
order
to
effect
our
object
more
quickly
and
without
inconveniencing
each
other
you
not
inconveniencing
me
said
lupin
scornfully
look
here
if
we
do
combine
only
one
of
us
will
succeed
that
good
enough
for
me
and
he
will
only
succeed
by
passing
over
the
other
body
are
you
prepared
for
that
sort
of
duel
lupin
a
duel
to
the
death
do
you
understand
the
knife
is
a
method
which
you
despise
but
suppose
you
received
one
lupin
right
in
the
throat
aha
so
when
all
is
said
that
what
you
propose
no
i
am
not
very
fond
of
shedding
blood
look
at
my
fists
i
strike
and
my
man
falls
i
have
special
blows
of
my
own
but
other
kills
remember
the
little
wound
in
the
throat
ah
lupin
beware
of
him
beware
of
that
one
he
is
terrible
he
is
implacable
nothing
stops
him
he
spoke
these
words
in
a
low
voice
and
with
such
excitement
that
sernine
shuddered
at
the
hideous
thought
of
the
unknown
murderer
baron
he
sneered
one
would
think
you
were
afraid
of
your
accomplice
i
am
afraid
for
the
others
for
those
who
bar
our
road
for
you
lupin
accept
or
you
are
lost
i
shall
act
myself
if
necessary
the
goal
is
too
near
i
have
my
hand
on
it
get
out
of
my
way
lupin
he
was
all
energy
and
exasperated
will
he
spoke
forcibly
and
so
brutally
that
he
seemed
ready
to
strike
his
enemy
then
and
there
sernine
shrugged
his
shoulders
lord
how
hungry
i
am
he
said
yawning
what
a
time
to
lunch
at
the
door
opened
lunch
is
served
sir
said
the
butler
ah
that
good
hearing
in
the
doorway
altenheim
caught
sernine
by
the
arm
and
disregarding
the
servant
presence
if
you
take
my
advice
accept
this
is
a
serious
moment
in
your
life
and
you
will
do
better
i
swear
to
you
you
will
do
better
to
accept
caviare
cried
sernine
now
that
too
sweet
of
you

remembered
that

entertaining
a
russian
prince

sat
down
facing
each
other
with
the
baron

large
animal
with
long
silver
hair
between
them
let
me
introduce
sirius
my
most
faithful
friend
a
said
sernine
i
shall
never
forget
the
one
which
the
tsar
was
good
enough
to
give
me
when
i
had
the
honor
to
save
his
life
ah

had
that
honor
a
terrorist
conspiracy

this
dog

name
by
the
way

sebastopol
the
lunch
continued
merrily
altenheim
had
recovered
his
good
humor
and
the
two
men
vied
with
each
other
in
wit
and
politeness
sernine
told
anecdotes
which
the
baron
capped
with
others
and
it
was
a
succession
of
stories
of
hunting
sport
and
travel
in
which
the
oldest
names
in
europe
were
constantly
cropping
up
spanish
grandees
english
lords
hungarian
magyars
austrian
archdukes
ah
said
sernine
what
a
fine
profession
is
ours
it
brings
us
into
touch
with
all
the
best
people
here
sirius
a
bit
of
this
truffled
chicken
the
dog
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
him
and
snapped
at
everything

sernine
gave
it
a
glass
of
chambertin
prince
with
pleasure
baron

can
recommend
it

from
king
leopold

i
must
congratulate
you

a
chef

untold
gold

socialist
deputy

hot
and
let
me
call
your
special
attention
to
the
little
dry
cakes
that
go
with
it
they
an
invention
of
genius
those
cakes
the
shape
is
charming
in
any
case
said
sernine
helping
himself
if
they
taste
as
good
as
they
look
here
sirius
you
sure
to
like
this
locusta
herself
could
not
have
done
better
he
took
one
of
the
cakes
and
gave
it
to
the
dog
sirius
swallowed
it
at
a
gulp
stood
motionless
for
two
or
three
seconds
as
though
dazed
then
turned
in
a
circle
and
fell
to
the
floor
dead
sernine
started
back
from
his
chair
lest
one
of
the
footmen
should
fall
upon
him
unawares
then
he
burst
out
laughing
look
here
baron
next
time
you
want
to
poison
one
of
your
friends
try
to
steady
your
voice
and
to
keep
your
hands
from
shaking
otherwise
people
suspect
you
but
i
thought
you
disliked
murder
with
the
knife
yes
said
altenheim
quite
unperturbed
but
i
have
always
had
a
wish
to
poison
some
one
i
wanted
to
see
what
it
was
like
by
jove
old
chap
you
choose
your
subjects
well
a
russian
prince
he
walked
up
to
altenheim
and
in
a
confidential
tone
said
do
you
know
what
would
have
happened
if
you
had
succeeded
that
is
to
say
if
my
friends
had
not
seen
me
return
at
three
at
the
latest
well
at
three
the
prefect
of
police
would
have
known
exactly
all
that
there
was
to
know
about
the
baron
altenheim
and
the
said
baron
would
have
been
copped
before
the
day
was
out
and
clapped
into
jail
pooh
said
altenheim
prison
one
escapes
from
whereas
one
does
not
come
back
from
the
kingdom
where
i
was
sending
you
true
but
you
would
have
to
send
me
there
first
and
that
not
so
easy
i
only
wanted
a
mouthful
of
one
of
those
cakes
are
you
quite
sure
try
one
thing
certain
my
lad
you
have
the
stuff
yet
which
great
adventurers
are
made
of
and
i
doubt
if
you
ever
have
it
considering
the
sort
of
traps
you
lay
for
me
a
man
who
thinks
himself
worthy
of
leading
the
life
which
you
and
i
have
the
honor
to
lead
must
also
be
fit
to
lead
it
and
for
that
must
be
prepared
for
every
eventuality
he
must
even
be
prepared
not
to
die
if
some
ragamuffin
or
other
tries
to
poison
him
an
undaunted
soul
in
an
unassailable
body
that
is
the
ideal
which
he
must
set
before
himself
and
attain
try
away
old
chap
as
for
me
i
am
undaunted
and
unassailable
remember
king
mithridates
he
went
back
to
his
chair
let
finish
our
lunch
but
as
i
like
proving
the
virtues
to
which
i
lay
claim
and
as
on
the
other
hand
i
do
want
to
hurt
your
feelings
just
pass
me
that
plate
of
cakes
he
took
one
of
them
broke
it
in
two
and
held
out
one
half
to
the
baron
eat
that
the
other
gave
a
movement
of
recoil
funk
said
sernine
and
before
the
wondering
eyes
of
the
baron
and
his
satellites
he
began
to
eat
the
first
and
then
the
second
half
of
the
cake
quietly
conscientiously
as
a
man
eats
a
dainty
of
which
he
would
hate
to
miss
the
smallest
morsel
they
met
again
that
same
evening
prince
sernine
invited
baron
altenheim
to
dinner
at
the
cabaret
vatel
with
a
party
consisting
of
a
poet
a
musician
a
financier
and
two
pretty
actresses
members
of
the
théâtre
français
the
next
day
they
lunched
together
in
the
bois
and
at
night
they
met
at
the
opéra
they
saw
each
other
every
day
for
a
week
one
would
have
thought
that
they
could
not
do
without
each
other
and
that
they
were
united
by
a
great
friendship
built
up
of
mutual
confidence
sympathy
and
esteem
they
had
a
capital
time
drinking
good
wine
smoking
excellent
cigars
and
laughing
like
two
madmen
in
reality
they
were
watching
each
other
fiercely
mortal
enemies
separated
by
a
merciless
hatred
each
feeling
sure
of
winning
and
longing
for
victory
with
an
unbridled
will
they
waited
for
the
propitious
moment
altenheim
to
do
away
with
sernine
and
sernine
to
hurl
altenheim
into
the
pit
which
he
was
digging
for
him
each
knew
that
the
catastrophe
could
not
be
long
delayed
one
or
other
of
them
must
meet
with
his
doom
and
it
was
a
question
of
hours
or
at
most
of
days
it
was
an
exciting
tragedy
and
one
of
which
a
man
like
sernine
was
bound
to
relish
the
strange
and
powerful
zest
to
know
your
adversary
and
to
live
by
his
side
to
feel
that
death
is
waiting
for
you
at
the
least
false
step
at
the
least
act
of
thoughtlessness
what
a
joy
what
a
delight
one
evening
they
were
alone
together
in
the
garden
of
the
rue
cambon
club
to
which
altenheim
also
belonged
it
was
the
hour
before
dusk
in
the
month
of
june
at
which
men
begin
to
dine
before
the
members
come
in
for
the
evening
they
were
strolling
round
a
little
lawn
along
which
ran
a
wall
lined
with
shrubs
beyond
the
shrubs
was
a
small
door
suddenly
while
altenheim
was
speaking
sernine
received
the
impression
that
his
voice
became
less
steady
that
it
was
almost
trembling
he
watched
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
altenheim
had
his
hand
in
the
pocket
of
his
jacket
and
sernine
that
hand
through
the
cloth
clutch
the
handle
of
a
dagger
hesitating
wavering
resolute
and
weak
by
turns
o
exquisite
moment
was
he
going
to
strike
which
would
gain
the
day
the
timid
instinct
that
dare
not
or
the
conscious
will
intense
upon
the
act
of
killing
his
chest
flung
out
his
arms
behind
his
back
sernine
waited
with
alternate
thrills
of
pleasure
and
of
pain
the
baron
had
ceased
talking
and
they
now
walked
on
in
silence
side
by
side
well
why
do
you
strike
cried
the
prince
impatiently
he
had
stopped
and
turning
to
his
companion
strike
he
said
this
is
the
time
or
never
there
is
no
one
to
see
you
you
can
slip
out
through
that
little
door
the
key
happens
to
be
hanging
on
the
wall
and
baron
unseen
and
unknown
but
of
course
all
this
was
arranged
you
brought
me
here
and
you
hesitating
why
on
earth
do
you
strike
he
looked
him
straight
in
the
eyes
the
other
was
livid
quivering
with
impotent
strength
you
milksop
sernine
sneered
i
shall
never
make
anything
of
you
shall
i
tell
you
the
truth
well
you
afraid
of
me
yes
old
chap
you
never
feel
quite
sure
what
may
happen
to
you
when
you
face
to
face
with
me
you
want
to
act
whereas
it
my
acts
my
possible
acts
that
govern
the
situation
no
it
quite
clear
that
you
not
the
man
yet
to
put
out
my
star
he
had
not
finished
speaking
when
he
felt
himself
seized
round
the
throat
and
dragged
backward
some
one
hiding
in
the
shrubbery
near
the
little
door
had
caught
him
by
the
head
he
saw
a
hand
raised
armed
with
a
knife
with
a
gleaming
blade
the
hand
fell
the
point
of
the
knife
caught
him
right
in
the
throat
at
the
same
moment
altenheim
sprang
upon
him
to
finish
him
off
and
they
rolled
over
into
the
it
was
a
matter
of
twenty
or
thirty
seconds
at
most
powerful
and
experienced
wrestler
as
he
was
altenheim
yielded
almost
immediately
uttering
a
cry
of
pain
sernine
rose
and
ran
to
the
little
door
which
had
just
closed
upon
a
dark
form
it
was
too
late
he
heard
the
key
turn
in
the
lock
he
was
unable
to
open
it
ah
you
scoundrel
he
said
the
day
on
which
i
catch
you
will
be
the
day
on
which
i
shed
my
first
blood
that
i
swear
to
god
he
went
back
stooped
and
picked
up
the
pieces
of
the
knife
which
had
broken
as
it
struck
him
altenheim
was
beginning
to
move
sernine
asked
well
baron
feeling
better
you
did
know
that
blow
eh
it
what
i
call
the
direct
blow
in
the
solar
plexus
that
is
to
say
it
snuffs
out
your
vital
sun
like
a
candle
it
clean
quick
painless
and
infallible
whereas
a
blow
with
a
dagger
pooh
a
man
has
only
to
wear
a
little
gorget
as
i
do
and
he
can
set
the
whole
world
at
defiance
especially
your
little
pal
in
black
seeing
that
he
always
strikes
at
the
throat
the
silly
monster
here
look
at
his
favorite
plaything
smashed
to
atoms
he
offered
him
his
hand
come
get
up
baron
you
shall
dine
with
me
and
do
please
remember
the
secret
of
my
superiority
an
undaunted
soul
in
an
unassailable
body
he
went
back
to
the
club
rooms
reserved
a
table
for
two
sat
down
on
a
sofa
and
while
waiting
for
dinner
soliloquized
under
his
breath
it
certainly
an
amusing
game
but
it
becoming
dangerous
i
must
get
it
over
otherwise
those
beggars
will
send
me
to
paradise
earlier
than
i
want
to
go
the
nuisance
is
that
i
ca
do
anything
before
i
find
old
steinweg
for
when
all
is
said
old
steinweg
is
the
only
interesting
factor
in
the
whole
business
and
my
one
reason
for
sticking
to
the
baron
is
that
i
keep
on
hoping
to
pick
up
some
clue
or
other
what
the
devil
have
they
done
with
him
altenheim
is
in
daily
communication
with
him
that
is
beyond
a
doubt
it
is
equally
beyond
a
doubt
that
he
is
doing
his
utmost
to
drag
out
of
him
what
he
knows
about
the
kesselbach
scheme
but
where
does
he
see
him
where
has
he
got
him
shut
up
with
friends
in
his
own
house
at
villa
dupont
he
reflected
for
some
time
then
lit
a
cigarette
took
three
puffs
at
it
and
threw
it
away
this
was
evidently
a
signal
for
two
young
men
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
he
did
not
seem
to
know
them
but
he
conversed
with
them
by
stealth
it
was
the
brothers
doudeville
got
up
that
day
like
men
of
fashion
what
is
it
governor
take
six
of
our
men
go
to
villa
dupont
and
make
your
way
in
the
devil
how
in
the
name
of
the
law
are
you
not
a
search
but
we
have
the
right
take
it
and
the
servants
if
they
resist
there
are
only
four
of
them
if
they
call
out
they
wo
call
out
if
altenheim
returns
he
wo
return
before
ten
i
see
to
it
that
gives
you
two
hours
and
a
half
which
is
more
than
you
require
to
explore
the
house
from
top
to
bottom
if
you
find
old
steinweg
come
and
tell
me
baron
altenheim
came
up
sernine
went
to
meet
him
let
have
some
dinner
shall
we
that
little
incident
in
the
garden
has
made
me
feel
hungry
by
the
way
my
dear
baron
i
have
a
few
bits
of
advice
to
give
you
they
sat
down
to
table
after
dinner
sernine
suggested
a
game
of
billiards
altenheim
accepted
when
the
game
was
over
they
went
to
the
the
croupier
was
just
shouting
there
are
fifty
louis
in
the
bank
any
bids
a
hundred
louis
said
altenheim
sernine
looked
at
his
watch
ten
the
doudevilles
had
not
returned
the
search
therefore
had
been
fruitless
banco
he
said
altenheim
sat
down
and
dealt
the
cards
i
give
no
seven
six
i
lose
said
sernine
shall
i
double
the
stakes
very
well
said
the
baron
he
dealt
out
the
cards
eight
said
sernine
nine
said
the
baron
laying
his
cards
down
sernine
turned
on
his
heels
muttering
that
costs
me
three
hundred
louis
but
i
do
mind
it
fixes
him
here
ten
minutes
later
his
motor
set
him
down
in
front
of
villa
dupont
and
he
found
the
doudevilles
and
their
men
collected
in
the
hall
have
you
hunted
out
the
old
boy
no
dash
it
but
he
must
be
somewhere
or
other
where
are
the
four
servants
over
there
in
the
pantry
tied
up
with
the
cook
as
well
good
i
would
as
soon
they
did
not
see
me
go
all
you
others
jean
stay
outside
and
keep
watch
jacques
show
me
over
the
house
he
quickly
ran
through
the
cellar
the
ground
floor
the
first
and
second
floors
and
the
attic
he
practically
stopped
nowhere
knowing
that
he
would
not
discover
in
a
few
minutes
what
his
men
had
not
been
able
to
discover
in
three
hours
but
he
carefully
noted
the
shape
and
the
arrangement
of
the
rooms
and
looked
for
some
little
detail
which
would
put
him
on
the
scent
when
he
had
finished
he
returned
to
a
bedroom
which
doudeville
had
told
him
was
altenheim
and
examined
it
attentively
this
will
do
he
said
raising
a
curtain
that
concealed
a
dark
closet
full
of
clothes
from
here
i
can
see
the
whole
of
the
room
but
if
the
baron
searches
the
house
why
should
he
he
will
know
that
we
have
been
here
through
his
servants
yes
but
he
will
never
dream
that
one
of
us
is
putting
up
here
for
the
night
he
will
think
that
the
attempt
failed
that
is
all
so
i
shall
stay
and
how
will
you
get
out
oh
that
asking
me
more
than
i
can
tell
you
the
great
thing
was
to
get
in
here
i
am
and
here
i
stay
go
doudeville
and
shut
the
doors
as
you
go
he
sat
down
on
a
little
box
at
the
back
of
the
cupboard
four
rows
of
hanging
clothes
protected
him
except
in
the
case
of
a
close
investigation
he
was
evidently
quite
safe
two
hours
passed
he
heard
the
dull
sound
of
a
horse
hoofs
and
the
tinkling
of
a
a
carriage
stopped
the
front
door
slammed
and
almost
immediately
he
heard
voices
exclamations
a
regular
outcry
that
increased
probably
as
each
of
the
prisoners
was
released
from
his
gag
they
are
explaining
the
thing
to
him
he
thought
the
baron
must
be
in
a
tearing
rage
he
now
understands
the
reason
for
my
conduct
at
the
club
and
sees
that
i
have
dished
him
nicely
dished
that
depends
after
all
i
have
got
steinweg
yet
that
is
the
first
thing
that
he
will
want
to
know
did
they
get
steinweg
to
find
this
out
he
will
go
straight
to
the
if
he
goes
up
it
means
that
the
is
upstairs
if
he
goes
down
then
it
is
in
the
basement
he
listened
the
sound
of
voices
continued
in
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
but
it
did
not
seem
as
if
any
one
were
moving
altenheim
must
be
his
confederates
it
was
half
an
hour
before
sernine
heard
steps
mounting
the
staircase
then
it
must
be
upstairs
he
said
to
himself
but
why
did
they
wait
so
long
go
to
bed
all
of
you
said
altenheim
voice
the
baron
entered
his
room
with
one
of
his
men
and
shut
the
door
and
i
am
going
to
bed
too
dominique
we
should
be
no
further
if
we
sat
arguing
all
night
my
opinion
is
said
the
other
that
he
came
to
fetch
steinweg
that
is
my
opinion
too
and
that
why
i
really
enjoying
myself
seeing
that
steinweg
is
here
but
where
is
he
after
all
what
have
you
done
with
him
that
my
secret
and
you
know
i
keep
my
secrets
to
myself
all
that
i
can
tell
you
is
that
he
is
in
safe
keeping
and
that
he
wo
get
out
before
he
has
spoken
so
the
prince
is
sold
sold
is
the
word
and
he
has
had
to
fork
out
to
attain
this
fine
result
oh
i
had
a
good
time
poor
prince
for
all
that
said
the
other
we
shall
have
to
get
rid
of
him
make
your
mind
easy
old
man
that
wo
take
long
before
a
week
out
you
shall
have
a
present
of
a
made
out
of
but
let
me
go
to
bed
now
i
dropping
with
sleep
there
was
a
sound
of
the
door
closing
then
sernine
heard
the
baron
push
the
bolt
empty
his
pockets
wind
up
his
watch
and
undress
he
seemed
in
a
gay
mood
whistling
and
singing
and
even
talking
aloud
yes
a
in
less
than
a
week
in
less
than
four
days
otherwise
he
eat
us
up
the
bully
no
matter
he
missed
his
shot
his
calculation
was
right
enough
though
steinweg
was
bound
to
be
here
only
there
you
are
he
got
into
bed
and
at
once
switched
off
the
light
sernine
had
come
forward
as
far
as
the
dividing
curtain
which
he
now
lifted
slightly
and
he
saw
the
vague
light
of
the
night
filtering
through
the
windows
leaving
the
bed
in
profound
darkness
he
hesitated
should
he
leap
out
upon
the
baron
take
him
by
the
throat
and
obtain
from
him
by
force
and
threats
what
he
had
not
been
able
to
obtain
by
craft
absurd
altenheim
would
never
allow
himself
to
be
intimidated
i
say
he
snoring
now
muttered
sernine
well
i
off
at
the
worst
i
shall
have
wasted
a
night
he
did
not
go
he
felt
that
it
would
be
impossible
for
him
to
go
that
he
must
wait
that
chance
might
yet
serve
his
turn
with
infinite
precautions
he
took
four
or
five
coats
and
from
their
hooks
laid
them
on
the
floor
made
himself
comfortable
and
with
his
back
to
the
wall
went
peacefully
to
sleep
the
baron
was
not
an
early
riser
a
clock
outside
was
striking
nine
when
he
got
out
of
bed
and
rang
for
his
servant
he
read
the
letters
which
his
man
brought
him
splashed
about
in
his
tub
dressed
without
saying
a
word
and
sat
down
to
his
table
to
write
while
dominique
was
carefully
hanging
up
the
clothes
of
the
previous
day
in
the
cupboard
and
sernine
asking
himself
with
his
fists
ready
to
strike
i
wonder
if
i
shall
have
to
stave
in
this
fellow
solar
plexus
at
ten
the
baron
was
ready
leave
me
said
he
to
the
servant
there
just
this
waistcoat
leave
me
i
say
come
back
when
i
ring
not
before
he
shut
the
door
himself
like
a
man
who
does
not
trust
others
went
to
a
table
on
which
a
telephone
was
standing
and
took
down
the
receiver
hullo
put
me
on
to
garches
please
mademoiselle
very
well
i
wait
till
you
ring
me
up
he
sat
down
to
the
instrument
the
rang
hullo
said
altenheim
is
that
garches
yes
that
right
give
me
number
please
mademoiselle
a
few
seconds
later
in
a
lower
voice
as
low
and
as
distinct
as
he
could
make
it
he
began
are
you
it
i
speaking
no
useless
words
yesterday
yes
you
missed
him
in
the
garden
another
time
of
course
but
the
thing
becoming
urgent
he
had
the
house
searched
last
night
i
tell
you
about
it
found
nothing
of
course
what
hullo
no
old
steinweg
refuses
to
speak
threats
promises
nothing
any
good
hullo
yes
of
course
he
sees
that
we
can
do
nothing
we
know
just
a
part
of
the
kesselbach
scheme
and
of
the
story
of
pierre
leduc
he
the
only
one
who
has
the
answer
to
the
riddle
oh
he
speak
all
right
that
i
answer
for
this
very
night
too
if

him
escape

the
prince

from
us
as
for
the
prince

at
two
he
replaced
the
receiver
and
went
out
a
few
hours
later
while
the
servants
were
at
lunch
prince
sernine
strolled
quietly
out
of
the
villa
dupont
feeling
rather
faint
in
the
head
and
weak
in
the
knees
and
while
making
for
the
nearest
restaurant
he
thus
summed
up
the
situation
so
on
tuesday

the
palace
hotel
murderer

an
appointment
at
garches
in
a
house

valenglay
the
prime
minister
sent
for
the
prefect
of
police
and
weber
the
of
the
and
showed
them
an
express
letter
which
he
had
just
received
monsieur
le
président
du
conseil
knowing
the
interest
which
you
take
in
lenormand
i
am
writing
to
inform
you
of
certain
facts
which
chance
has
revealed
to
me
lenormand
is
locked
up
in
the
cellars
of
the
villa
des
glycines
at
garches
near
the
house
of
retreat
the
ruffians
of
the
palace
hotel
have
resolved
to
murder
him
at
two
if
the
police
require
my
assistance
they
will
find
me
at
one
in
the
garden
of
the
house
of
retreat
or
at
the
occupied
by
kesselbach
whose
friend
i
have
the
honor
to
be
i
am
monsieur
le
président
du
conseil
your
obedient
servant
prince
sernine
this
is
an
exceedingly
grave
matter
my
dear
weber
said
valenglay
i
may
add
that
we
can
have
every
confidence
in
the
accuracy
of
prince
sernine
statements
i
have
often
met
him
at
dinner
he
is
a
serious
intelligent
man
will
you
allow
me
monsieur
le
président
asked
the
detective
to
show
you
another
letter
which
i
also
received
this
morning
about
the
same
case
yes
let
me
see
it
he
took
the
letter
and
read
sir
this
is
to
inform
you
that
prince
paul
sernine
who
calls
himself
kesselbach
friend
is
really
arsène
lupin
one
proof
will
be
sufficient
is
the
anagram
of
not
a
letter
more
not
a
letter
less
and
weber
added
while
valenglay
stood
amazed
this
time
our
friend
lupin
has
found
an
adversary
who
is
a
match
for
him
while
he
denounces
the
other
the
other
betrays
him
to
us
and
the
fox
is
caught
in
the
trap
what
do
you
propose
to
do
monsieur
le
président
i
shall
take
two
hundred
men
with
me
chapter
viii
the
a
quarter
past
twelve
in
a
restaurant
near
the
madeleine
the
prince
is
at
lunch
two
young
men
sit
down
at
the
next
table
he
bows
to
them
and
begins
to
speak
to
them
as
to
friends
whom
he
has
met
by
chance
are
you
going
on
the
expedition
eh
yes
how
many
men
altogether
six
i
think
each
goes
down
by
himself
we
to
meet
weber
at
a
quarter
to
two
near
the
house
of
retreat
very
well
i
shall
be
there
what
am
i
not
leading
the
expedition
and
is
it
my
business
to
find
lenormand
seeing
that
i
announced
it
publicly
then
you
believe
that
lenormand
is
not
dead
governor
i
sure
of
it
do
you
know
anything
yes
since
yesterday
i
know
for
certain
that
altenheim
and
his
gang
took
lenormand
and
gourel
to
the
bridge
at
bougival
and
heaved
them
overboard
gourel
sank
but
lenormand
managed
to
save
himself
i
shall
furnish
all
the
necessary
proofs
when
the
time
comes
but
then
if
he
alive
why
does
he
show
himself
because
he
not
free
is
what
you
said
true
then
is
he
in
the
cellars
of
the
villa
des
glycines
i
have
every
reason
to
think
so
but
how
do
you
know
what
clue
that
my
secret
i
can
tell
you
one
thing
the
revelation
will
be
what
shall
i
say
sensational
have
you
finished
yes
my
car
is
behind
the
madeleine
join
me
there
at
garches
sernine
sent
the
motor
away
and
they
walked
to
the
path
that
led
to
geneviève
school
there
he
stopped
listen
to
me
lads
this
is
of
the
highest
importance
you
will
ring
at
the
house
of
retreat
as
inspectors
you
have
your
right
of
entry
have
you
not
you
will
then
go
to
the
pavillon
hortense
the
empty
one
there
you
will
run
down
to
the
basement
and
you
will
find
an
old
shutter
which
you
have
only
to
lift
to
see
the
opening
of
a
tunnel
which
i
discovered
lately
and
which
forms
a
direct
communication
with
the
villa
des
glycines
it
was
by
means
of
this
that
gertrude
and
baron
altenheim
used
to
meet
and
it
was
this
way
that
lenormand
passed
only
to
end
by
falling
into
the
hands
of
his
enemies
you
think
so
governor
yes
i
think
so
and
now
the
point
is
this
you
must
go
and
make
sure
that
the
tunnel
is
exactly
in
the
condition
in
which
i
left
it
last
night
that
the
two
doors
which
bar
it
are
open
and
that
there
is
still
in
a
hole
near
the
second
door
a
parcel
wrapped
in
a
piece
of
black
cloth
which
i
put
there
myself
are
we
to
undo
the
parcel
no
that
not
necessary
it
a
change
of
clothes
go
and
do
let
yourselves
be
seen
more
than
you
can
help
i
will
wait
for
you
ten
minutes
later
they
were
back
the
two
doors
are
open
said
one
of
the
doudevilles
and
the
black
cloth
parcel
in
its
place
near
the
second
door
capital
it
is
past
one
weber
will
be
arriving
with
his
champions
they
are
to
watch
the
villa
they
will
surround
it
as
soon
as
altenheim
is
inside
i
have
arranged
with
weber
that
i
shall
ring
the
bell
the
door
will
be
opened
and
i
shall
have
my
foot
inside
the
citadel
once
there
i
have
my
plan
come
i
an
idea
that
we
shall
see
some
fun
and
sernine
after
dismissing
them
walked
down
the
path
to
the
school
soliloquizing
as
he
went
all
bodes
well
the
battle
will
be
fought
on
the
ground
chosen
by
myself
i
am
bound
to
win
i
shall
get
rid
of
my
two
adversaries
and
i
shall
find
myself
alone
engaged
in
the
kesselbach
case
alone
with
two
whacking
pierre
leduc
and
steinweg
besides
the
king
that
is
to
say
bibi
only
there
one
thing
what
is
altenheim
up
to
obviously
he
has
a
plan
of
attack
of
his
own
on
which
side
does
he
mean
to
attack
me
and
how
does
it
come
that
he
has
not
attacked
me
yet
it
rather
startling
can
he
have
denounced
me
to
the
police
he
went
along
the
little
playground
of
the
school
the
pupils
were
at
their
lessons
he
knocked
at
the
door
ah
is
that
you
said
mme
ernemont
opening
the
door
so
you
have
left
geneviève
in
paris
for
me
to
do
that
geneviève
would
have
to
be
in
paris
he
replied
so
she
has
been
seeing
that
you
sent
for
her
what
that
he
exclaimed
catching
hold
of
her
arm
why
you
know
better
than
i
i
know
nothing
i
know
nothing
speak
did
you
write
to
geneviève
to
meet
you
at
the
gare
and
did
she
go
why
of
course
you
were
to
lunch
together
at
the
hôtel
ritz
the
letter
show
me
the
letter
she
went
to
fetch
it
and
gave
it
to
him
but
wretched
woman
could
you
see
that
it
was
a
forgery
the
handwriting
is
a
good
imitation
but
it
a
forgery
any
one
can
see
that
he
pressed
his
clenched
hands
to
his
temples
with
rage
that
the
move
i
was
wondering
about
oh
the
dirty
scoundrel
attacking
me
through
her
but
how
does
he
know
no
he
does
not
know
he
tried
it
on
twice
now
and
it
because
of
geneviève
because
he
taken
a
fancy
to
her
oh
not
that
never
listen
victoire
are
you
sure
that
she
does
love
him
oh
losing
my
head
wait
wait
i
must
think
this
is
the
moment
he
looked
at
his
watch
minutes
to
two
i
have
time
idiot
that
i
am
time
to
do
what
how
do
i
know
where
she
is
he
walked
up
and
down
like
a
madman
and
his
old
nurse
seemed
astounded
at
seeing
him
so
excited
with
so
little
control
of
himself
after
all
she
said
there
is
nothing
to
prove
that
she
did
not
suspect
the
trap
at
the
last
moment
where
could
she
be
i
do
know
perhaps
at
mrs
kesselbach
that
true
that
true
you
right
he
cried
filled
with
sudden
hope
and
he
set
out
at
a
run
for
the
house
of
retreat
on
the
way
near
the
gate
he
met
the
brothers
doudeville
who
were
entering
the
porter
lodge
the
lodge
looked
out
on
the
road
and
this
enabled
them
to
watch
the
approaches
to
the
villa
des
glycines
without
stopping
he
went
straight
to
the
pavillon
de
called
suzanne
and
told
her
to
take
him
to
kesselbach
geneviève
he
asked
geneviève
yes
has
she
been
here
no
not
for
several
days
but
she
is
to
come
is
she
not
do
you
think
so
why
i
certain
of
it
where
do
you
think
she
is
can
you
remember
it
no
use
my
trying
i
assure
you
that
geneviève
and
i
had
made
no
arrangement
to
see
each
other
and
suddenly
alarmed
but
you
not
anxious
are
you
has
anything
happened
to
geneviève
no
nothing
he
had
already
left
the
room
an
idea
had
occurred
to
him
suppose
altenheim
were
not
at
the
villa
des
glycines
suppose
the
hour
of
the
meeting
had
been
changed
i
must
see
him
he
said
to
himself
i
must
at
all
costs
and
he
ran
along
with
a
disordered
air
indifferent
to
everything
but
in
front
of
the
lodge
he
at
once
recovered
his
composure
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
of
the
talking
to
the
brothers
doudeville
in
the
garden
had
he
commanded
his
usual
acute
discernment
he
would
have
perceived
the
little
start
which
weber
gave
as
he
approached
but
he
saw
nothing
weber
i
believe
he
asked
yes
to
whom
have
i
the
honor
prince
sernine
ah
very
good
monsieur
le
préfet
de
police
has
told
me
of
the
great
service
which
you
are
doing
us
monsieur
that
service
will
not
be
complete
until
i
have
handed
the
ruffians
over
to
you
that
wo
take
long
i
believe
that
one
of
those
ruffians
has
just
gone
in
a
man
with
a
swarthy
complexion
yes
that
baron
altenheim
are
your
men
here
m
weber
yes
concealed
along
the
road
at
two
hundred
yards
from
this
well
weber
it
seems
to
me
that
you
might
collect
them
and
bring
them
to
this
lodge
from
here
we
will
go
to
the
villa
as
baron
altenheim
knows
me
i
presume
they
will
open
the
door
to
me
and
i
will
go
in
with
you
it
is
an
excellent
plan
said
weber
i
shall
come
back
at
once
he
left
the
garden
and
walked
down
the
road
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
villa
des
glycines
sernine
quickly
took
one
of
the
brothers
doudeville
by
the
arm
run
after
him
jacques
keep
him
engaged
long
enough
for
me
to
get
inside
the
glycines
and
then
delay
the
attack
as
long
as
you
can
invent
pretexts
i
shall
want
ten
minutes
let
the
villa
be
surrounded
but
not
entered
and
you
jean
go
and
post
yourself
in
the
pavillon
hortense
at
the
entrance
to
the
underground
passage
if
the
baron
tries
to
go
out
that
way
break
his
head
the
doudevilles
moved
away
as
ordered
the
prince
slipped
out
and
ran
to
a
tall
gate
barred
with
iron
which
was
the
entrance
to
the
glycines
should
he
ring
there
was
no
one
in
sight
with
one
bound
he
leapt
upon
the
gate
placing
his
foot
on
the
lock
and
hanging
on
to
the
bars
getting
a
purchase
with
his
knees
and
hoisting
himself
up
with
his
wrists
he
managed
at
the
risk
of
falling
on
the
sharp
points
of
the
bars
to
climb
over
the
gate
and
jump
down
he
found
a
paved
courtyard
which
he
crossed
briskly
and
mounted
the
steps
of
a
pillared
peristyle
on
which
the
windows
looked
out
these
were
all
closed
to
the
very
top
with
full
shutters
as
he
stood
thinking
how
he
should
make
his
way
into
the
house
the
door
was
half
opened
with
a
noise
of
iron
that
reminded
him
of
the
door
in
the
villa
dupont
and
altenheim
appeared
i
say
prince
is
that
the
way
you
trespass
on
private
property
i
shall
be
forced
to
call
in
the
gendarmes
my
dear
fellow
sernine
caught
him
by
the
throat
and
throwing
him
down
on
a
bench
geneviève
where
is
geneviève
if
you
do
tell
me
what
done
with
her
you
villain
please
observe
stammered
the
baron
that
you
are
making
it
impossible
for
me
to
speak
sernine
released
his
hold
of
him
to
the
point
and
look
sharp
answer
geneviève
there
is
one
thing
replied
the
baron
which
is
much
more
urgent
especially
where
fellows
like
you
and
me
are
concerned
and
that
is
to
feel
one
self
at
home
and
he
carefully
closed
the
front
door
which
he
barricaded
with
bolts
then
leading
sernine
to
the
adjoining
a
room
without
furniture
or
curtains
he
said
now
i
your
man
what
can
i
do
for
you
prince
geneviève
she
is
in
perfect
health
ah
so
you
confess
of
course
i
may
even
tell
you
that
your
imprudence
in
this
respect
surprised
me
why
did
you
take
a
few
precautions
it
was
inevitable
enough
where
is
she
you
are
not
very
polite
where
is
she
between
four
walls
free
free
yes
free
to
go
from
one
wall
to
another
where
where
come
prince
do
you
think
i
should
be
fool
enough
to
tell
you
the
secret
by
which
i
hold
you
you
love
the
little
girl
hold
your
tongue
shouted
sernine
beside
himself
i
forbid
you
what
next
is
there
anything
to
be
ashamed
of
i
love
her
myself
and
i
have
risked
he
did
not
complete
his
sentence
frightened
by
the
terrific
anger
of
sernine
a
restrained
dumb
anger
that
distorted
the
prince
features
they
looked
at
each
other
for
a
long
time
each
of
them
seeking
for
the
adversary
weak
point
at
last
sernine
stepped
forward
and
speaking
very
distinctly
like
a
man
who
is
threatening
rather
than
proposing
a
compact
listen
to
me
he
said
you
remember
the
offer
of
partnership
which
you
made
me
the
kesselbach
business
for
the
two
of
us
we
were
to
act
together
we
were
to
share
the
profits
i
refused
i
accept
too
late
wait
i
accept
more
than
that
i
give
the
whole
business
up
i
shall
take
no
further
part
in
it
you
shall
have
it
all
if
necessary
i
help
you
what
is
the
condition
tell
me
where
geneviève
is
the
baron
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
driveling
lupin
i
sorry
for
you
at
your
age
there
was
a
fresh
silence
between
the
two
enemies
a
terrible
silence
then
the
baron
sneered
all
the
same
it
a
holy
joy
to
see
you
like
that
sniveling
and
begging
i
say
it
seems
to
me
that
the
private
soldier
is
giving
his
general
a
sound
beating
you
ass
muttered
sernine
prince
i
shall
send
you
my
seconds
this
evening
if
you
are
still
in
this
world
you
ass
repeated
sernine
with
infinite
contempt
you
would
rather
settle
the
matter
here
and
now
as
you
please
prince
your
last
hour
has
struck
you
can
commend
your
soul
to
god
you
smile
that
a
mistake
i
have
one
immense
advantage
over
you
i
kill
when
it
necessary
you
ass
said
sernine
once
more
he
took
out
his
watch
it
is
two
baron
you
have
only
a
few
minutes
left
at
five
past
two
ten
past
at
the
very
latest
weber
and
sturdy
men
without
a
scruple
amongst
them
will
lay
hands
on
you
do
you
smile
either
the
outlet
on
which
you
reckoning
is
discovered
i
know
it
it
is
guarded
so
you
are
thoroughly
caught
it
means
the
scaffold
old
chap
altenheim
turned
livid
he
stammered
you
did
this
you
have
had
the
infamy
the
house
is
surrounded
the
assault
is
at
hand
speak
and
i
will
save
you
how
the
men
watching
the
outlet
in
the
pavillon
hortense
belong
to
me
i
have
only
to
give
you
a
word
for
them
and
you
are
saved
speak
altenheim
reflected
for
a
few
seconds
and
seemed
to
hesitate
but
suddenly
resolutely
declared
this
is
all
bluff
you
would
never
have
been
simple
enough
to
rush
into
the
lion
mouth
you
forgetting
geneviève
but
for
her
do
you
think
i
should
be
here
speak
no
very
well
let
us
wait
said
sernine
a
cigarette
thank
you
a
few
seconds
passed
do
you
hear
asked
sernine
yes
yes
said
altenheim
rising
blows
rang
against
the
gate
sernine
observed
not
even
the
usual
summons
no
preliminaries
your
mind
is
still
made
up
more
so
than
ever
you
know
that
with
the
tools
they
carry
they
wo
take
long
if
they
were
inside
this
room
i
should
still
refuse
the
gate
yielded
they
heard
it
creak
on
its
hinges
to
allow
one
self
to
get
nabbed
said
sernine
is
admissible
but
to
hold
out
one
own
hands
to
the
handcuffs
is
too
silly
come
be
obstinate
speak
and
bolt
and
you
i
shall
remain
what
have
i
to
be
afraid
of
look
the
baron
pointed
to
a
chink
between
the
shutters
sernine
put
his
eye
to
it
and
jumped
back
with
a
start
oh
you
scoundrel
so
you
have
denounced
me
too
it
not
ten
men
that
weber
bringing
but
fifty
men
a
hundred
two
hundred
the
baron
laughed
and
if
there
are
so
many
of
them
it
because
they
after
lupin
that
obvious
would
have
been
enough
for
me
you
informed
the
police
yes
what
proof
did
you
give
your
name
that
is
to
say
and
you
found
that
out
all
by
yourself
did
you
a
thing
which
nobody
else
thought
of
nonsense
it
was
the
other
one
admit
it
he
looked
out
through
the
chink
swarms
of
policemen
were
spreading
round
the
villa
and
the
blows
were
now
sounding
on
the
door
he
must
however
think
of
one
of
two
things
either
his
escape
or
else
the
execution
of
the
plan
which
he
had
contrived
but
to
go
away
even
for
a
moment
meant
leaving
altenheim
and
who
could
guarantee
that
the
baron
had
not
another
outlet
at
his
disposal
to
escape
by
this
thought
paralyzed
sernine
the
baron
free
the
baron
at
liberty
to
go
back
to
geneviève
and
torture
her
and
make
her
subservient
to
his
odious
love
thwarted
in
his
designs
obliged
to
improvise
a
new
plan
on
the
very
second
while
subordinating
everything
to
the
danger
which
geneviève
was
running
sernine
passed
through
a
moment
of
cruel
indecision
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
baron
eyes
he
would
have
liked
to
tear
his
secret
from
him
and
to
go
away
and
he
no
longer
even
tried
to
convince
him
so
useless
did
all
words
seem
to
him
and
while
pursuing
his
own
thoughts
he
asked
himself
what
the
baron
thoughts
could
be
what
his
weapons
what
his
hope
of
safety
the
though
strongly
bolted
though
sheeted
with
iron
was
beginning
to
give
way
the
two
men
stood
behind
that
door
motionless
the
sound
of
voices
the
sense
of
words
reached
them
you
seem
very
sure
of
yourself
said
sernine
i
should
think
so
cried
the
other
suddenly
tripping
him
to
the
floor
and
running
away
sernine
sprang
up
at
once
dived
through
a
little
door
under
the
staircase
through
which
altenheim
had
disappeared
and
ran
down
the
stone
steps
to
the
basement
a
passage
led
to
a
large
low
almost
room
where
he
found
the
baron
on
his
knees
lifting
the
flap
of
a
idiot
shouted
sernine
flinging
himself
upon
him
you
know
that
you
will
find
my
men
at
the
end
of
this
tunnel
and
that
they
have
orders
to
kill
you
like
a
dog
unless
unless
you
have
an
outlet
that
joins
on
to
this
ah
there
of
course
i
guessed
it
and
you
imagine
the
fight
was
a
desperate
one
altenheim
a
real
colossus
endowed
with
exceptional
muscular
force
had
caught
his
adversary
round
the
arms
and
body
and
was
pressing
him
against
his
own
chest
numbing
his
arms
and
trying
to
smother
him
of
course
of
course
sernine
panted
with
difficulty
of
course
that
well
thought
out
as
long
as
i
ca
use
my
arms
to
break
some
part
of
you
you
will
have
the
advantage
only
can
you
he
gave
a
shudder
the
which
had
closed
again
and
on
the
flap
of
which
they
were
bearing
down
with
all
their
weight
the
seemed
to
move
beneath
them
he
felt
the
efforts
that
were
being
made
to
raise
it
and
the
baron
must
have
felt
them
too
for
he
desperately
tried
to
shift
the
ground
of
the
contest
so
that
the
might
open
it
other
one
thought
sernine
with
the
sort
of
unreasoning
terror
which
that
mysterious
being
caused
him
it
the
other
one
if
he
gets
through
i
done
for
by
dint
of
imperceptible
movements
altenheim
had
succeeded
in
shifting
his
own
position
and
he
tried
to
drag
his
adversary
after
him
but
sernine
clung
with
his
legs
to
the
baron
legs
and
at
the
same
time
very
gradually
tried
to
release
one
of
his
hands
above
their
heads
great
blows
resounded
like
the
blows
of
a
i
have
five
minutes
thought
sernine
in
one
minute
this
fellow
will
have
to
then
speaking
aloud
look
out
old
chap
stand
tight
he
brought
his
two
knees
together
with
incredible
force
the
baron
yelled
with
a
twisted
thigh
then
sernine
taking
advantage
of
his
adversary
pain
made
an
effort
freed
his
right
arm
and
seized
him
by
the
throat
that
capital
we
shall
be
more
comfortable
like
this
no
it
not
worth
while
getting
out
your
knife
if
you
do
i
wring
your
neck
like
a
chicken
you
see
i
polite
and
considerate
i
not
pressing
too
hard
just
enough
to
keep
you
from
even
wanting
to
kick
about
while
speaking
he
took
from
his
pocket
a
very
thin
cord
and
with
one
hand
with
extreme
skill
fastened
his
wrists
for
that
matter
the
baron
now
at
his
last
gasp
offered
not
the
least
resistance
with
a
few
accurate
movements
sernine
tied
him
up
firmly
how
well
you
behaving
what
a
good
thing
i
should
hardly
know
you
here
in
case
you
were
thinking
of
escaping
i
have
a
roll
of
wire
that
will
finish
off
my
little
work
the
wrists
first
now
the
ankles
that
it
by
jove
how
nice
you
look
the
baron
had
gradually
come
to
himself
again
he
spluttered
if
you
give
me
up
geneviève
will
die
really
and
how
explain
yourself
she
is
locked
up
no
one
knows
where
she
is
if
i
put
away
she
will
die
of
starvation
sernine
shuddered
he
retorted
yes
but
you
will
speak
never
yes
you
will
speak
not
now
it
too
late
but
he
bent
down
over
him
and
whispering
in
his
ear
said
listen
altenheim
and
understand
what
i
say
you
be
caught
presently
sleep
at
the
dépôt
that
is
fatal
irrevocable
i
myself
can
do
nothing
to
prevent
it
now
and
they
will
take
you
to
the
santé
and
later
you
know
where
well
i
giving
you
one
more
chance
of
safety
you
understand
i
shall
come
to
your
cell
at
the
dépôt
and
you
shall
tell
me
where
geneviève
is
two
hours
later
if
you
have
told
the
truth
you
shall
be
free
if
not
it
means
that
you
do
attach
much
value
to
your
head
the
other
made
no
reply
sernine
stood
up
and
listened
there
was
a
great
crash
overhead
the
yielded
footsteps
beat
the
flags
of
the
hall
and
the
floor
of
the
drawing
room
weber
and
his
men
were
searching
baron
think
it
over
until
this
evening
the
is
a
good
counsellor
he
pushed
his
prisoner
aside
so
as
to
uncover
the
and
lifted
it
as
he
expected
there
was
no
longer
any
one
below
on
the
steps
of
the
staircase
he
went
down
taking
care
to
leave
the
open
behind
him
as
though
he
meant
to
come
back
there
were
twenty
steps
at
the
bottom
of
which
began
the
passage
through
which
lenormand
and
gourel
had
come
in
the
opposite
direction
he
entered
it
and
gave
an
exclamation
he
thought
he
felt
somebody
presence
there
he
lit
his
the
passage
was
empty
then
he
cocked
his
revolver
and
said
aloud
all
right
i
going
to
fire
no
reply
not
a
sound
it
an
illusion
no
doubt
he
thought
that
creature
is
becoming
an
obsession
come
if
i
want
to
pull
off
my
stroke
and
win
the
game
i
must
hurry
the
hole
in
which
i
hid
the
parcel
of
clothes
is
not
far
off
i
shall
take
the
parcel
and
the
trick
is
done
and
what
a
trick
one
of
lupin
best
he
came
to
a
door
that
stood
open
and
at
once
stopped
to
the
right
was
an
excavation
the
one
which
lenormand
had
made
to
escape
from
the
rising
water
he
stooped
and
threw
his
light
into
the
opening
oh
he
said
with
a
start
no
it
not
possible
doudeville
must
have
pushed
the
parcel
farther
along
but
search
and
pry
into
the
darkness
as
he
might
the
parcel
was
gone
and
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
it
was
once
more
the
mysterious
being
who
had
taken
it
what
a
pity
the
thing
was
so
neatly
arranged
the
adventure
would
have
resumed
its
natural
course
and
i
should
have
achieved
my
aim
with
greater
certainty
as
it
is
i
must
push
along
as
fast
as
i
can
doudeville
is
at
the
pavillon
hortense
my
retreat
is
insured
no
more
nonsense
i
must
hurry
and
set
things
straight
again
if
i
can
and
we
attend
to
afterward
oh
he
better
keep
clear
of
my
claws
that
one
but
an
exclamation
of
stupor
escaped
his
lips
he
had
come
to
the
other
door
and
this
door
the
last
before
the
was
shut
he
flung
himself
upon
it
what
was
the
good
what
could
he
do
this
time
he
muttered
i
badly
done
and
seized
with
a
sort
of
lassitude
he
sat
down
he
had
a
sense
of
his
weakness
in
the
face
of
the
mysterious
being
altenheim
hardly
counted
but
the
other
that
person
of
darkness
and
silence
the
other
loomed
up
before
him
upset
all
his
plans
and
exhausted
him
with
his
cunning
and
infernal
attacks
he
was
beaten
weber
would
find
him
there
like
an
animal
run
to
earth
at
the
bottom
of
his
cave
ah
no
he
cried
springing
up
with
a
bound
no
if
there
were
only
myself
well
and
good
but
there
is
geneviève
geneviève
who
must
be
saved
after
all
the
game
is
not
yet
lost
if
the
other
one
vanished
just
now
it
proves
that
there
is
a
second
outlet
somewhere
near
come
come
weber
and
his
merry
men
have
got
me
yet
he
had
already
begun
to
explore
the
tunnel
and
lantern
in
hand
was
examining
the
bricks
of
which
the
horrible
walls
were
formed
when
a
yell
reached
his
ears
a
dreadful
yell
that
made
his
flesh
creep
with
anguish
it
came
from
the
direction
of
the
and
he
suddenly
remembered
that
he
had
left
the
open
at
the
time
when
he
intended
to
return
to
the
villa
des
glycines
he
hurried
back
and
passed
through
the
first
door
his
lantern
went
out
on
the
road
and
he
felt
something
or
rather
somebody
brush
past
his
knees
somebody
crawl
along
the
wall
and
at
that
same
moment
he
had
a
feeling
that
this
being
was
disappearing
vanishing
he
knew
not
which
way
just
then
his
foot
knocked
against
a
step
this
is
the
outlet
he
thought
the
second
outlet
through
which
passes
overhead
the
cry
sounded
again
less
loud
followed
by
moans
by
a
hoarse
gurgling
he
ran
up
the
stairs
came
out
in
the
basement
room
and
rushed
to
the
baron
altenheim
lay
dying
with
the
blood
streaming
from
his
throat
his
bonds
were
cut
but
the
wire
that
fastened
his
wrists
and
ankles
was
intact
accomplice
being
unable
to
release
him
had
cut
his
sernine
gazed
upon
the
sight
with
horror
an
icy
perspiration
covered
his
whole
body
he
thought
of
geneviève
imprisoned
helpless
abandoned
to
the
most
awful
of
deaths
because
the
baron
alone
knew
where
she
was
hidden
he
distinctly
heard
the
policemen
open
the
little
back
door
in
the
hall
he
distinctly
heard
them
come
down
the
kitchen
stairs
there
was
nothing
between
him
and
them
save
one
door
that
of
the
basement
room
in
which
he
was
he
bolted
the
door
at
the
very
moment
when
the
aggressors
were
laying
hold
of
the
handle
the
was
open
beside
him
it
meant
possible
safety
because
there
remained
the
second
outlet
no
he
said
to
himself
geneviève
first
afterward
if
i
have
time
i
will
think
of
myself
he
knelt
down
and
put
his
hand
on
the
baron
breast
the
heart
was
still
beating
he
stooped
lower
still
you
can
hear
me
ca
you
the
eyelids
flickered
feebly
the
dying
man
was
just
breathing
was
there
anything
to
be
obtained
from
this
faint
semblance
of
life
the
policemen
were
attacking
the
door
the
last
rampart
sernine
whispered
i
will
save
you
i
have
infallible
remedies
one
word
only
geneviève
it
was
as
though
this
word
of
hope
revived
the
man
strength
altenheim
tried
to
utter
articulate
sounds
answer
said
sernine
persisting
answer
and
i
will
save
you
answer
it
means
your
life
your
liberty
answer
the
door
shook
under
the
blows
that
rained
upon
it
the
baron
gasped
out
unintelligible
syllables
leaning
over
him
affrighted
straining
all
his
energy
all
his
will
to
the
utmost
sernine
panted
with
anguish
he
no
longer
gave
a
thought
to
the
policemen
his
inevitable
capture
prison
but
geneviève
geneviève
dying
of
hunger
whom
one
word
from
that
villain
could
set
free
answer
you
must
he
ordered
and
entreated
by
turns
altenheim
stammered
as
though
hypnotized
and
defeated
by
that
indomitable
imperiousness
ri
rivoli
rue
de
rivoli
is
that
it
you
have
locked
her
up
in
a
house
in
that
street
eh
which
number
a
loud
din
followed
by
shouts
of
triumph
the
door
was
down
jump
on
him
lads
cried
weber
seize
him
seize
both
of
them
and
sernine
on
his
knees
the
number
answer
if
you
love
her
answer
why
keep
silence
now
twenty
whispered
the
baron
hands
were
laid
on
sernine
ten
revolvers
were
pointed
at
him
he
rose
and
faced
the
policemen
who
fell
back
with
instinctive
dread
if
you
stir
lupin
cried
weber
with
his
revolver
leveled
at
him
i
blow
out
your
brains
do
shoot
said
sernine
solemnly
it
not
necessary
i
surrender
humbug
this
is
another
of
your
tricks
no
replied
sernine
the
battle
is
lost
you
have
no
right
to
shoot
i
am
not
defending
myself
he
took
out
two
revolvers
and
threw
them
on
the
floor
humbug
weber
repeated
implacably
aim
straight
at
his
heart
lads
at
the
least
movement
fire
at
the
least
word
fire
there
were
ten
men
there
he
placed
five
more
in
position
he
pointed
their
fifteen
right
arms
at
the
mark
and
raging
shaking
with
joy
and
fear
he
snarled
at
his
heart
at
his
head
and
no
pity
if
he
stirs
if
he
speaks
shoot
him
where
he
stands
sernine
smiled
impassively
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
death
was
there
waiting
for
him
at
two
inches
from
his
chest
at
two
inches
from
his
temples
fifteen
fingers
were
curled
round
the
triggers
ah
chuckled
weber
this
is
nice
this
is
very
nice
and
i
think
that
this
time
we
scored
and
it
a
nasty
for
you
master
lupin
he
made
one
of
his
men
draw
back
the
shutters
of
a
large
which
admitted
a
sudden
burst
of
daylight
and
he
turned
toward
altenheim
but
to
his
great
amazement
the
baron
whom
he
thought
dead
opened
his
eyes
glazed
awful
eyes
already
filled
with
all
the
signs
of
the
coming
dissolution
he
stared
at
weber
then
he
seemed
to
look
for
somebody
and
catching
sight
of
sernine
had
a
convulsion
of
anger
he
seemed
to
be
waking
from
his
torpor
and
his
suddenly
reviving
hatred
restored
a
part
of
his
strength
he
raised
himself
on
his
two
wrists
and
tried
to
speak
you
know
him
eh
asked
weber
yes
it
lupin
is
it
yes
lupin
sernine
still
smiling
listened
heavens
how
i
amusing
myself
he
declared
have
you
anything
more
to
say
asked
weber
who
saw
the
lips
making
desperate
attempts
to
move
yes
about
lenormand
perhaps
yes
have
you
shut
him
up
where
answer
with
all
his
heaving
body
with
all
his
tense
glance
altenheim
pointed
to
a
cupboard
in
the
corner
of
the
room
there
there
he
said
ah
we
burning
chuckled
lupin
weber
opened
the
cupboard
on
one
of
the
shelves
was
a
parcel
wrapped
in
black
cloth
he
opened
it
and
found
a
hat
a
little
box
some
clothes
he
gave
a
start
he
had
recognized
oh
the
villains
he
cried
they
have
murdered
him
no
said
altenheim
shaking
his
head
then
it
he
he
what
do
you
mean
by
did
lupin
kill
the
chief
no
altenheim
was
clinging
to
existence
with
fierce
obstinacy
eager
to
speak
and
to
accuse
the
secret
which
he
wished
to
reveal
was
at
the
tip
of
his
tongue
and
he
was
not
able
did
not
know
how
to
translate
it
into
words
come
the
insisted
lenormand
is
dead
surely
no
he
alive
yes
i
do
understand
look
here
these
clothes
this
altenheim
turned
his
eyes
toward
sernine
an
idea
struck
weber
ah
i
see
lupin
stole
lenormand
clothes
and
reckoned
upon
using
them
to
escape
with
yes
yes
not
bad
cried
the
it
quite
a
trick
in
his
style
in
this
room
we
should
have
found
lupin
disguised
as
lenormand
chained
up
no
doubt
it
would
have
meant
his
safety
only
he
had
time
that
it
is
it
yes
yes
but
by
the
appearance
of
the
dying
man
eyes
weber
felt
that
there
was
more
and
that
the
secret
was
not
exactly
that
what
was
it
then
what
was
the
strange
and
unintelligible
puzzle
which
altenheim
wanted
to
explain
before
dying
he
questioned
him
again
and
where
is
lenormand
himself
there
what
do
you
mean
here
yes
but
there
are
only
ourselves
here
there
there
oh
speak
there
ser
sernine
sernine
eh
what
sernine
lenormand
weber
gave
a
jump
a
sudden
light
flashed
across
him
no
no
it
not
possible
he
muttered
this
is
madness
he
gave
a
at
his
prisoner
sernine
seemed
to
be
greatly
diverted
and
to
be
watching
the
scene
with
the
air
of
a
playgoer
who
is
thoroughly
amused
and
very
anxious
to
know
how
the
piece
is
going
to
end
altenheim
exhausted
by
his
efforts
had
fallen
back
at
full
length
would
he
die
before
revealing
the
solution
of
the
riddle
which
his
strange
words
had
propounded
weber
shaken
by
an
absurd
incredible
surmise
which
he
did
not
wish
to
entertain
and
which
persisted
in
his
mind
in
spite
of
him
made
a
fresh
determined
attempt
explain
the
thing
to
us
what
at
the
bottom
of
it
what
mystery
the
other
seemed
not
to
hear
and
lay
lifeless
with
staring
eyes
weber
lay
down
beside
him
with
his
body
touching
him
and
putting
great
stress
upon
his
words
so
that
each
syllable
should
sink
down
to
the
very
depths
of
that
brain
already
merged
in
darkness
said
listen
i
have
understood
you
correctly
have
i
not
lupin
and
lenormand
he
needed
an
effort
to
continue
so
monstrous
did
the
words
appear
to
him
nevertheless
the
baron
dimmed
eyes
seemed
to
contemplate
him
with
anguish
he
finished
the
sentence
shaking
with
excitement
as
though
he
were
speaking
blasphemy
that
it
is
it
you
sure
the
two
are
one
and
the
same
the
eyes
did
not
move
a
little
blood
trickled
from
one
corner
of
the
man
mouth
he
gave
two
or
three
sobs
a
last
spasm
and
all
was
over
a
long
silence
reigned
in
that
basement
room
filled
with
people
almost
all
the
policemen
guarding
sernine
had
turned
round
and
stupefied
not
understanding
or
not
willing
to
understand
they
still
listened
to
the
incredible
accusation
which
the
dying
scoundrel
had
been
unable
to
put
into
words
weber
took
the
little
box
which
was
in
the
parcel
and
opened
it
it
contained
a
gray
wig
a
pair
of
spectacles
a
neckerchief
and
in
a
false
bottom
a
pot
or
two
of
and
a
case
containing
some
tiny
tufts
of
gray
hair
in
short
all
that
was
needed
to
complete
a
perfect
disguise
in
the
character
of
lenormand
he
went
up
to
sernine
and
looking
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
without
speaking
thoughtfully
reconstructing
all
the
phases
of
the
adventure
he
muttered
so
it
true
sernine
who
had
retained
his
smiling
calmness
replied
the
suggestion
is
a
pretty
one
and
a
bold
one
but
before
i
answer
tell
your
men
to
stop
worrying
me
with
those
toys
of
theirs
very
well
said
weber
making
a
sign
to
his
men
and
now
answer
what
are
you
m
lenormand
yes
exclamations
arose
jean
doudeville
who
was
there
while
his
brother
was
watching
the
secret
outlet
jean
doudeville
sernine
own
accomplice
looked
at
him
in
dismay
weber
stood
undecided
that
takes
your
breath
away
eh
said
sernine
i
admit
that
rather
droll
lord
how
you
used
to
make
me
laugh
sometimes
when
we
were
working
together
you
and
i
the
chief
and
the
and
the
funniest
thing
is
that
you
thought
our
worthy
lenormand
dead
as
well
as
poor
gourel
but
no
no
old
chap
there
life
in
the
old
dog
yet
he
pointed
to
altenheim
corpse
there
it
was
that
scoundrel
who
pitched
me
into
the
water
in
a
sack
with
a
round
my
waist
only
he
forgot
to
take
away
my
knife
and
with
a
knife
one
rips
open
sacks
and
cuts
ropes
so
you
see
you
unfortunate
altenheim
if
you
had
thought
of
that
you
would
be
where
you
are
but
enough
said
peace
to
your
ashes
weber
listened
not
knowing
what
to
think
at
last
he
made
a
gesture
of
despair
as
though
he
gave
up
the
idea
of
forming
a
reasonable
opinion
the
handcuffs
he
said
suddenly
alarmed
if
it
amuses
you
said
sernine
and
picking
out
doudeville
in
the
front
row
of
his
assailants
he
put
out
his
wrists
there
my
friend
you
shall
have
the
honour
and
do
trouble
to
exert
yourself
i
playing
square
as
it
no
use
doing
anything
else
he
said
this
in
a
tone
that
gave
doudeville
to
understand
that
the
struggle
was
finished
for
the
moment
and
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
submit
doudeville
fastened
the
handcuffs
without
moving
his
lips
or
contracting
a
muscle
of
his
face
sernine
whispered
rue
de
rivoli
geneviève
weber
could
not
suppress
a
movement
of
satisfaction
at
the
sight
come
along
he
said
to
the
that
it
to
the
cried
sernine
lenormand
will
enter
arsène
lupin
in
the
and
arsène
lupin
will
enter

you
too
clever
lupin
that
true
weber
we
shall
never
get
on
you
and
i
during
the
drive
in
the
escorted
by
three
other
cars
filled
with
policemen
he
did
not
utter
a
word
they
did
not
stay
long
at
the
detective
office
weber
remembering
the
escapes
effected
by
lupin
sent
him
up
at
once
to
the
department
and
then
took
him
to
the
dépôt
whence
he
was
sent
on
to
the
santé
prison
the
governor
had
been
warned
by
telephone
and
was
waiting
for
him
the
formalities
of
the
entry
of
commitment
and
of
the
searching
were
soon
got
over
and
at
seven
in
the
evening
prince

sernine
crossed
the
threshold
of

declared

mr

i
take
this

he
flung
himself
on
the
bed
oh
mr
governor
i
have
one
little
favor
to
ask
of
you
what
is
that
tell
them
not
to
bring
me
my
chocolate
before

i
awfully

he
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
five
minutes
later
he
was
sound
asleep

there
was
one
wild
burst
of
laughter
over
the
whole
face
of
the
world
true
the
capture
of
arsène
lupin
made
a
big
sensation
and
the
public
did
not
grudge
the
police
the
praise
which
they
deserved
for
this
revenge
so
long
and
now
so
fully
obtained
the
great
adventurer
was
caught
that
extraordinary
genial
invisible
hero
was
shivering
like
any
ordinary
criminal
between
the
four
walls
of
a
prison
cell
crushed
in
his
turn
by
that
formidable
power
which
is
called
the
law
and
which
sooner
or
later
by
inevitable
necessity
shatters
the
obstacles
opposed
to
it
and
destroys
the
work
of
its
adversaries
all
this

discussed

speeches
made
very
well
but
one
thing
nevertheless
rose
above
the
wonderful
concert
of
praise
these
noisy
demonstrations
of
satisfaction
and
that
was
an
immense
spontaneous
inextinguishable
and
tumultuous
roar
of
laughter
arsène
lupin
had
been
chief
of

for
four
years
he
had
been
chief
detective

four
years
and
really
legally
he
was
chief

still
with
all
the
rights
which
the

confers

years
the

had
been

to

he
saw
that

pursued

guilty

what
services
he
had
rendered
never

disturbed
never
was

with

the

need
but
take
back
his
mind
to

the

at

the
attack
on

express
the

of

of

and

to
compare
with

most
famous
victories
of

most
renowned

footnote
the
murder
of
baron
dorf
that
mysterious
and
disconcerting
affair
will
one
day
be
the
subject
of
a
story
which
will
give
an
idea
of
arsène
lupin
astonishing
qualities
as
a
detective
not
so
very
long
before
in
a
speech
delivered
at
the
time
of
the
fire
at
the
louvre
and
the
capture
of
the
incendiaries
valenglay
the
prime
minister
had
said
speaking
in
defence
of
the
somewhat
arbitrary
manner
in
which
lenormand
had
acted
on
that
occasion
with
his
great
powers
of
discernment
his
energy
his
qualities
of
decision
and
execution
his
unexpected
methods
his
inexhaustible
resources
lenormand
reminds
us
of
the
only
man
who
if
he
were
still
alive
could
hope
to
hold
his
own
against
him
i
mean
arsène
lupin
lenormand
is
an
arsène
lupin
in
the
service
of
society
and
lo
and
behold
lenormand
was
none
other
than
arsène
lupin
that
he
was
a
russian
prince
who
cared
lupin
was
an
old
hand
at
such
changes
of
personality
as
that
but
chief
detective
what
a
delicious
irony
what
a
whimsical
humor
in
the
conduct
of
that
extraordinary
life
lenormand
arsène
lupin
people
were
now
able
to
explain
to
themselves
the
apparently
miraculous
feats
of
intelligence
which
had
quite
recently
bewildered
the
crowd
and
baffled
the
police
they
understood
how
his
accomplice
had
been
juggled
away
in
the
middle
of
the
palais
de
justice
itself
in
broad
daylight
and
on
the
appointed
day
had
he
himself
not
said
my
process
is
so
ingenious
and
so
simple
how
surprised
people
will
be
on
the
day
when
i
am
free
to
speak
that
all
i
shall
be
asked
that
is
all
but
it
had
to
be
thought
of
it
was
indeed
childishly
simple
all
you
had
to
do
was
to
be
chief
of
the
well
lupin
was
chief
of
the
and
every
obeying
his
orders
had
made
himself
the
involuntary
and
unconscious
accomplice
of
arsène
lupin
what
a
comedy
what
admirable
bluff
it
was
the
monumental
and
consoling
farce
of
these
drab
times
of
ours
lupin
in
prison
lupin
irretrievably
conquered
was
in
spite
of
himself
the
great
conqueror
from
his
cell
he
shone
over
paris
he
was
more
than
ever
the
idol
more
than
ever
the
master
when
arsène
lupin
awoke
next
morning
in
his
room
at
the
santé
palace
as
he
at
once
nicknamed
it
he
had
a
very
clear
vision
of
the
enormous
sensation
which
would
be
produced
by
his
arrest
under
the
double
name
of
sernine
and
lenormand
and
the
double
title
of
prince
and
chief
of
the
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
gave
vent
to
his
thoughts
a
man
can
have
no
better
companion
in
his
loneliness
than
the
approval
of
his
contemporaries
o
fame
the
sun
of
all
living
men
seen
by
daylight
his
cell
pleased
him
even
better
than
at
night
the
window
placed
high
up
in
the
wall
afforded
a
glimpse
of
the
branches
of
a
tree
through
which
peeped
the
blue
of
the
sky
above
the
walls
were
white
there
was
only
one
table
and
one
chair
both
fastened
to
the
floor
but
everything
was
quite
nice
and
clean
come
he
said
a
little
here
will
be
rather
charming
but
let
us
see
to
our
toilet
have
i
all
i
want
no
in
that
case
ring
twice
for
the
chambermaid
he
pressed
the
button
of
an
apparatus
beside
the
door
which
released
a
in
the
corridor
after
a
moment
bolts
and
bars
were
drawn
outside
a
key
turned
in
the
lock
and
a
warder
appeared
hot
water
please
said
lupin
the
other
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
mingled
amazement
and
rage
oh
said
lupin
and
a
by
jove
there
no
the
man
growled
you
getting
at
me
are
you
you
better
be
careful
he
was
going
away
when
lupin
caught
him
roughly
by
the
arm
here
a
hundred
francs
if
you
post
a
letter
for
me
he
took
out
a
note
which
he
had
concealed
during
the
search
and
offered
it
to
him
where
the
letter
said
the
warder
taking
the
money
just
give
me
a
moment
to
write
it
he
sat
down
at
the
table
scribbled
a
few
words
in
pencil
on
a
sheet
of
paper
put
it
in
an
envelope
and
addressed
the
letter
to
monsieur
b
poste
restante
paris
the
warder
took
the
letter
and
walked
away
that
letter
said
lupin
to
himself
will
reach
destination
as
safely
as
if
i
delivered
it
myself
i
shall
have
the
reply
in
an
hour
at
latest
just
the
time
i
want
to
take
a
good
look
into
my
position
he
sat
down
on
his
chair
and
in
an
undertone
summed
up
the
situation
as
follows
when
all
is
said
and
done
i
have
two
adversaries
to
fight
at
the
present
moment
there
is
first
society
which
holds
me
and
which
i
can
afford
to
laugh
at
secondly
there
is
a
person
unknown
who
does
not
hold
me
but
whom
i
am
not
inclined
to
laugh
at
in
the
very
least
it
is
he
who
told
the
police
that
i
was
sernine
it
was
he
who
guessed
that
i
was
lenormand
it
was
he
who
locked
the
door
of
the
underground
passage
and
it
was
he
who
had
me
clapped
into
prison
arsène
lupin
reflected
for
a
second
and
then
continued
so
at
long
last
the
struggle
lies
between
him
and
me
and
to
keep
up
that
struggle
that
is
to
say
to
discover
and
get
to
the
bottom
of
the
kesselbach
case
here
am
i
a
prisoner
while
he
is
free
unknown
and
inaccessible
and
holds
the
two
which
i
considered
mine
pierre
leduc
and
old
steinweg
in
short
he
is
near
the
goal
after
finally
pushing
me
back
a
fresh
contemplative
pause
followed
by
a
fresh
soliloquy
the
position
is
far
from
brilliant
on
the
one
side
everything
on
the
other
nothing
opposite
me
a
man
of
my
own
strength
or
stronger
because
he
has
not
the
same
scruples
that
hamper
me
and
i
am
without
weapons
to
attack
him
with
he
repeated
the
last
sentence
several
times
in
a
mechanical
voice
and
then
stopped
and
taking
his
forehead
between
his
hands
sat
for
a
long
time
wrapped
in
thought
come
in
mr
governor
he
said
seeing
the
door
open
were
you
expecting
me
why
i
wrote
to
you
mr
governor
asking
you
to
come
i
felt
certain
that
the
warder
would
give
you
my
letter
i
was
so
certain
of
it
that
i
put
your
initials
and
your
age
on
the
envelope
the
governor
name
in
point
of
fact
was
stanislas
borély
and
he
was
years
of
age
he
was
a
man
with
a
very
gentle
character
who
treated
the
prisoners
with
all
the
indulgence
possible
he
said
to
lupin
your
opinion
of
my
subordinate
integrity
was
quite
correct
here
is
your
money
it
shall
be
handed
to
you
at
your
release
you
will
now
go
through
the
again
lupin
went
with
borély
to
the
little
room
reserved
for
this
purpose
undressed
and
while
his
clothes
were
inspected
with
justifiable
suspicion
himself
underwent
a
most
fastidious
examination
he
was
then
taken
back
to
his
cell
and
borély
said
i
feel
easier
that
done
and
very
well
done
mr
governor
your
men
perform
this
sort
of
duty
with
a
delicacy
for
which
i
should
like
to
thank
them
by
giving
them
a
small
token
of
my
satisfaction
he
handed
a
note
to
borély
who
jumped
as
though
he
had
been
shot
oh
but
where
does
that
come
from
no
need
to
rack
your
brains
mr
governor
a
man
like
myself
leading
the
life
that
i
do
is
always
prepared
for
any
eventuality
and
no
mishap
however
painful
not
even
imprisonment
can
take
him
unawares
seizing
the
middle
finger
of
his
left
hand
between
the
thumb
and
forefinger
of
the
right
he
pulled
it
off
smartly
and
presented
it
calmly
to
borély
do
start
like
that
mr
governor
this
is
not
my
finger
but
just
a
tube
made
of
skin
and
cleverly
colored
which
fits
exactly
over
my
middle
finger
and
gives
the
illusion
of
a
real
finger
and
he
added
with
a
laugh
in
such
a
way
of
course
as
to
conceal
a
third
note
what
is
a
poor
man
to
do
he
must
carry
the
best
purse
he
can
and
must
needs
make
use
of
it
on
occasions
he
stopped
at
the
sight
of
borély
startled
face
please
do
think
mr
governor
that
i
wish
to
dazzle
you
with
my
little
i
only
wanted
to
show
you
that
you
have
to
do
with
a
client
of
a
rather
special
nature
and
to
tell
you
that
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
i
venture
now
and
again
to
break
the
ordinary
rules
and
regulations
of
your
establishment
the
governor
had
recovered
himself
he
said
plainly
i
prefer
to
think
that
you
will
conform
to
the
rules
and
not
compel
me
to
resort
to
harsh
measures
which
you
would
regret
to
have
to
enforce
is
that
it
mr
governor
that
just
what
i
should
like
to
spare
you
by
proving
to
you
in
advance
that
they
would
not
prevent
me
from
doing
as
i
please
from
corresponding
with
my
friends
from
defending
the
grave
interests
confided
to
me
outside
these
walls
from
writing
to
the
newspapers
that
accept
my
inspiration
from
pursuing
the
fulfilment
of
my
plans
and
lastly
from
preparing
my
escape
your
escape
lupin
began
to
laugh
heartily
but
think
mr
governor
my
only
excuse
for
being
in
prison
is
to
leave
it
the
argument
did
not
appear
to
satisfy
borély
he
made
an
effort
to
laugh
in
his
turn
forewarned
is
forearmed
he
said
that
what
i
wanted
lupin
replied
take
all
your
precautions
mr
governor
neglect
nothing
so
that
later
they
may
have
nothing
to
reproach
you
with
on
the
other
hand
i
shall
arrange
things
in
such
a
way
that
whatever
annoyance
you
may
have
to
bear
in
consequence
of
my
escape
your
career
at
least
shall
not
suffer
that
is
all
i
had
to
say
to
you
mr
governor
you
can
go
and
while
borély
walked
away
greatly
perturbed
by
his
singular
charge
and
very
anxious
about
the
events
in
preparation
the
prisoner
threw
himself
on
his
bed
muttering
what
cheek
lupin
old
fellow
what
cheek
really
any
one
would
think
that
you
had
some
idea
as
to
how
you
were
going
to
get
out
of
this
the
santé
prison
is
built
on
the
star
plan
in
the
centre
of
the
main
portion
is
a
round
hall
upon
which
all
the
corridors
converge
so
that
no
prisoner
is
able
to
leave
his
cell
without
being
at
once
perceived
by
the
overseers
posted
in
the
glass
box
which
occupies
the
middle
of
that
central
hall
the
thing
that
most
surprises
the
visitor
who
goes
over
the
prison
is
that
at
every
moment
he
will
meet
prisoners
without
a
guard
of
any
kind
who
seem
to
move
about
as
though
they
were
absolutely
free
in
reality
in
order
to
go
from
one
point
to
another
for
instance
from
their
cell
to
the
van
waiting
in
the
yard
to
take
them
to
the
palais
de
justice
for
the
magistrate
examination
they
pass
along
straight
lines
each
of
which
ends
in
a
door
that
is
opened
to
them
by
a
warder
the
sole
duty
of
the
warder
is
to
open
and
shut
this
door
and
to
watch
the
two
straight
lines
which
it
commands
and
thus
the
prisoners
while
apparently
at
liberty
to
come
and
go
as
they
please
are
sent
from
door
to
door
from
eye
to
eye
like
so
many
parcels
passed
from
hand
to
hand
outside
municipal
guards
receive
the
object
and
pack
it
into
one
of
the
compartments
of
the
footnote
the
french
slang
expression
for
its
or
black
maria
this
is
the
ordinary
routine
in
lupin
case
it
was
disregarded
entirely
the
police
were
afraid
of
that
walk
along
the
corridors
they
were
afraid
of
the
they
were
afraid
of
everything
weber
came
in
person
accompanied
by
twelve
constables
the
best
he
had
picked
men
armed
to
the
teeth
fetched
the
formidable
prisoner
at
the
door
of
his
cell
and
took
him
in
a
cab
the
driver
of
which
was
one
of
his
own
men
with
mounted
municipal
guards
trotting
on
each
side
in
front
and
behind
bravo
cried
lupin
i
am
quite
touched
by
the
compliment
paid
me
a
guard
of
honor
by
jove
weber
you
have
the
proper
hierarchical
instinct
you
do
forget
what
is
due
to
your
immediate
chief
and
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
weber
i
intend
to
send
in
my
resignation
i
shall
name
you
as
my
successor
it
almost
done
said
weber
that
good
news
i
was
a
little
anxious
about
my
escape
now
i
am
easy
in
my
mind
from
the
moment
when
weber
is
chief
of
the
weber
did
not
reply
to
the
gibe
at
heart
he
had
a
queer
complex
feeling
in
the
presence
of
his
adversary
a
feeling
made
up
of
the
fear
with
which
lupin
inspired
him
the
deference
which
he
entertained
for
prince
sernine
and
the
respectful
admiration
which
he
had
always
shown
to
lenormand
all
this
was
mingled
with
spite
envy
and
satisfied
hatred
they
arrived
at
the
palais
de
justice
at
the
foot
of
the
a
number
of
detectives
were
waiting
among
whom
weber
rejoiced
to
see
his
best
two
lieutenants
the
brothers
doudeville
has
formerie
come
he
asked
yes
chief
monsieur
le
juge
is
in
his
room
weber
went
up
the
stairs
followed
by
lupin
who
had
the
doudevilles
on
either
side
of
him
geneviève
whispered
the
prisoner
saved
where
is
she
with
her
grandmother
mrs
kesselbach
in
paris
at
the
bristol
suzanne
disappeared
steinweg
released
what
has
he
told
you
nothing
wo
make
any
revelations
except
to
you
why
we
told
him
he
owed
his
release
to
you
newspapers
good
this
morning
excellent
good
if
you
want
to
write
to
me
here
are
my
instructions
they
had
reached
the
inner
corridor
on
the
first
floor
and
lupin
slipped
a
pellet
of
paper
into
the
hand
of
one
of
the
brothers
formerie
uttered
a
delicious
phrase
when
lupin
entered
his
room
accompanied
by
the
ah
there
you
are
i
knew
we
should
lay
hands
on
you
some
day
or
other
so
did
i
monsieur
le
juge
said
lupin
and
i
am
glad
that
you
have
been
marked
out
by
fate
to
do
justice
to
the
honest
man
that
i
am
he
getting
at
me
thought
formerie
and
in
the
same
ironical
and
serious
tone
as
lupin
he
retorted
the
honest
man
that
you
are
sir
will
be
asked
what
he
has
to
say
about
three
hundred
and
separate
cases
of
larceny
burglary
swindling
and
forgery
blackmail
receiving
and
so
on
three
hundred
and
what
is
that
all
cried
lupin
i
really
feel
quite
ashamed
do
distress
yourself
i
shall
discover
more
but
let
us
proceed
in
order
arsène
lupin
in
spite
of
all
our
inquiries
we
have
no
definite
information
as
to
your
real
name
how
odd
no
more
have
i
we
are
not
even
in
a
position
to
declare
that
you
are
the
same
arsène
lupin
who
was
confined
in
the
santé
a
few
years
back
and
from
there
made
his
first
escape
first
escape
is
good
and
does
you
credit
it
so
happens
in
fact
continued
formerie
that
the
arsène
lupin
card
in
the
measuring
department
gives
a
description
of
arsène
lupin
which
differs
at
all
points
from
your
real
description
how
more
and
more
odd
different
marks
different
measurements
different
the
two
photographs
even
are
quite
unlike
i
will
therefore
ask
you
to
satisfy
us
as
to
your
exact
identity
that
just
what
i
was
going
to
ask
you
i
have
lived
under
so
many
distinct
names
that
i
have
ended
by
forgetting
my
own
i
do
know
where
i
am
so
i
must
enter
a
refusal
to
answer
an
inability
is
this
a
plan
am
i
to
expect
the
same
silence
in
reply
to
all
my
questions
very
nearly
and
why
lupin
struck
a
solemn
attitude
and
said
le
juge
my
life
belongs
to
history
you
have
only
to
turn
over
the
annals
of
the
past
fifteen
years
and
your
curiosity
will
be
satisfied
so
much
for
my
part
as
to
the
rest
it
does
not
concern
me
it
is
an
affair
between
you
and
the
murderers
at
the
palace
hotel
arsène
lupin
the
honest
man
that
you
are
will
have
to
explain
the
murder
of
master
altenheim
hullo
this
is
new
is
the
idea
yours
monsieur
le
juge
exactly
very
clever
upon
my
word
formerie
you
getting
on
the
position
in
which
you
were
captured
leaves
no
doubt
none
at
all
only
i
will
venture
to
ask
you
this
what
sort
of
wound
did
altenheim
die
of
of
a
wound
in
the
throat
caused
by
a
knife
and
where
is
the
knife
it
has
not
been
found
how
could
it
not
have
been
found
if
i
had
been
the
assassin
considering
that
i
was
captured
beside
the
very
man
whom
i
am
supposed
to
have
killed
who
killed
him
according
to
you
the
same
man
that
killed
kesselbach
chapman
and
beudot
the
nature
of
the
wound
is
a
sufficient
proof
how
did
he
get
away
through
a
which
you
will
discover
in
the
room
where
the
tragedy
took
place
formerie
assumed
an
air
of
slyness
and
how
was
it
that
you
did
not
follow
that
useful
example
i
tried
to
follow
it
but
the
outlet
was
blocked
by
a
door
which
i
could
not
open
it
was
during
this
attempt
that
other
one
came
back
to
the
room
and
killed
his
accomplice
for
fear
of
the
revelations
which
he
would
have
been
sure
to
make
at
the
same
time
he
hid
in
a
cupboard
where
it
was
subsequently
found
the
parcel
of
clothes
which
i
had
prepared
what
were
those
clothes
for
to
disguise
myself
when
i
went
to
the
glycines
my
plan
was
this
to
hand
altenheim
over
to
the
police
to
suppress
my
own
identity
as
prince
sernine
and
to
reappear
under
the
features
of
lenormand
i
suppose
exactly
no
what
formerie
gave
a
knowing
smile
and
wagged
his
forefinger
from
left
to
right
and
right
to
left
no
he
repeated
what
do
you
mean
by
that
story
about
lenormand
well
will
do
for
the
public
my
friend
but
you
wo
make
formerie
swallow
that
lupin
and
lenormand
were
one
and
the
same
man
he
burst
out
laughing
lupin
chief
of
the
no
anything
you
like
but
not
that
there
are
limits
i
am
an
fellow
i
believe
anything
but
still
come
between
ourselves
what
was
the
reason
of
this
fresh
hoax
i
confess
i
ca
see
lupin
looked
at
him
in
astonishment
in
spite
of
all
that
he
knew
of
formerie
he
could
not
conceive
such
a
degree
of
infatuation
and
blindness
there
was
at
that
moment
only
one
person
in
the
world
who
refused
to
believe
in
prince
sernine
double
personality
and
that
was
formerie
lupin
turned
to
the
who
stood
listening
my
dear
weber
i
fear
your
promotion
is
not
so
certain
as
i
thought
for
you
see
if
lenormand
is
not
myself
then
he
exists
and
if
he
exists
i
have
no
doubt
that
formerie
with
all
his
acumen
will
end
by
discovering
him
in
which
case
we
shall
discover
him
all
right
lupin
cried
the
i
undertake
that
and
i
tell
you
that
when
you
and
he
are
confronted
we
shall
see
some
fun
he
chuckled
and
drummed
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
how
amusing
oh
one
never
bored
when
you
there
that
i
say
for
you
so
you
lenormand
and
it
you
who
arrested
your
accomplice
marco
just
so
was
it
my
duty
to
please
the
prime
minister
and
save
the
cabinet
the
fact
is
historical
formerie
held
his
sides
oh
i
shall
die
of
laughing
i
know
i
shall
lord
what
a
joke
that
answer
will
travel
round
the
world
so
according
to
your
theory
it
was
with
you
that
i
made
the
first
enquiries
at
the
palace
hotel
after
the
murder
of
kesselbach
surely
it
was
with
me
that
you
investigated
the
case
of
the
stolen
coronet
when
i
was
duc
de
chamerace
retorted
lupin
in
a
sarcastic
voice
footnote
see
by
edgar
jepson
and
maurice
leblanc
formerie
gave
a
start
all
his
merriment
was
dispelled
by
that
odious
recollection
turning
suddenly
grave
he
asked
so
you
persist
in
that
absurd
theory
i
must
because
it
is
the
truth
it
would
be
easy
for
you
to
take
a
steamer
to
and
to
find
at
saigon
the
proofs
of
the
death
of
the
real
lenormand
the
worthy
man
whom
i
replaced
and
whose
i
can
show
you
humbug
upon
my
word
monsieur
le
juge
i
do
care
one
way
or
the
other
if
it
annoys
you
that
i
should
be
lenormand
do
talk
about
it
we
wo
talk
about
myself
we
wo
talk
about
anything
at
all
if
you
prefer
besides
of
what
use
can
it
be
to
you
the
kesselbach
case
is
such
a
tangled
affair
that
i
myself
do
know
where
i
stand
there
only
one
man
who
might
help
you
i
have
not
succeeded
in
discovering
him
and
i
do
think
that
you
what
the
man
name
he
an
old
man
a
german
called
steinweg
but
of
course
heard
about
him
weber
and
the
way
in
which
he
was
carried
off
in
the
middle
of
the
palais
de
justice
formerie
threw
an
inquiring
glance
at
the
weber
said
i
undertake
to
bring
that
person
to
you
monsieur
le
juge
so
that
done
said
formerie
rising
from
his
chair
as
you
see
lupin
this
was
merely
a
formal
examination
to
bring
the
two
duelists
together
now
that
we
have
crossed
swords
all
that
we
need
is
the
necessary
witness
of
our
your
counsel
tut
is
it
indispensable
indispensable
employ
counsel
in
view
of
such
an
unlikely
trial
you
must
in
that
case
i
choose
maître
quimbel
the
president
of
the
corporation
of
the
bar
you
are
wise
you
will
be
well
defended
the
first
sitting
was
over
weber
led
the
prisoner
away
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
of
the
between
the
two
doudevilles
lupin
said
in
short
imperative
sentences
watch
steinweg
do
let
him
speak
to
anybody
be
there
i
give
you
some
letters
one
for
you
important
downstairs
he
walked
up
to
the
municipal
guards
surrounding
the
home
boys
he
exclaimed
and
quick
about
it
i
have
an
appointment
with
myself
for
two
precisely
there
were
no
incidents
during
the
drive
on
returning
to
his
cell
lupin
wrote
a
long
letter
full
of
detailed
instructions
to
the
brothers
doudeville
and
two
other
letters
one
was
for
geneviève
geneviève
you
now
know
who
i
am
and
you
will
understand
why
i
concealed
from
you
the
name
of
him
who
twice
carried
you
away
in
his
arms
when
you
were
a
little
girl
geneviève
i
was
your
mother
friend
a
distant
friend
of
whose
double
life
she
knew
nothing
but
upon
whom
she
thought
that
she
could
rely
and
that
is
why
before
dying
she
wrote
me
a
few
lines
asking
me
to
watch
over
you
unworthy
as
i
am
of
your
esteem
geneviève
i
shall
continue
faithful
to
that
trust
do
not
drive
me
from
your
heart
entirely
arsène
lupin
the
other
letter
was
addressed
to
dolores
kesselbach
prince
sernine
was
led
to
seek
acquaintance
by
motives
of
alone
but
a
great
longing
to
devote
himself
to
her
was
the
cause
of
his
continuing
it
now
that
prince
sernine
has
become
merely
arsène
lupin
he
begs
kesselbach
not
to
deprive
him
of
the
right
of
protecting
her
at
a
distance
and
as
a
man
protects
one
whom
he
will
never
see
again
there
were
some
envelopes
on
the
table
he
took
up
one
and
took
up
a
second
then
when
he
took
up
the
third
he
noticed
a
sheet
of
white
paper
the
presence
of
which
surprised
him
and
which
had
words
stuck
upon
it
evidently
cut
out
of
a
newspaper
he
read
you
have
failed
in
your
fight
with
the
baron
give
up
interesting
yourself
in
the
case
and
i
will
not
oppose
your
escape
once
more
lupin
had
that
sense
of
repulsion
and
terror
with
which
this
nameless
and
fabulous
being
always
inspired
him
a
sense
of
disgust
which
one
feels
at
touching
a
venomous
animal
a
reptile
he
again
he
said
even
here
that
also
scared
him
the
sudden
vision
which
he
at
times
received
of
this
hostile
power
a
power
as
great
as
his
own
and
disposing
of
formidable
means
the
extent
of
which
he
himself
was
unable
to
realize
he
at
once
suspected
his
warder
but
how
had
it
been
possible
to
corrupt
that
man
well
so
much
the
better
after
all
he
cried
i
have
never
had
to
do
except
with
dullards
in
order
to
fight
myself
i
had
to
chuck
myself
into
the
command
of
the
this
time
i
have
some
one
to
deal
with
here
a
man
who
puts
me
in
his
pocket
by
sleight
of
hand
one
might
say
if
i
succeed
from
my
prison
cell
in
avoiding
his
blows
and
smashing
him
in
seeing
old
steinweg
and
dragging
his
confession
from
him
in
setting
the
kesselbach
case
on
its
legs
and
turning
the
whole
of
it
into
cash
in
defending
kesselbach
and
winning
fortune
and
happiness
for
geneviève
well
then
lupin
will
be
lupin
still
eleven
days
passed
on
the
twelfth
day
lupin
woke
very
early
and
exclaimed
let
me
see
if
my
calculations
are
correct
and
if
the
gods
are
on
my
side
there
will
be
some
news
i
have
had
four
interviews
with
formerie
the
fellow
must
be
worked
up
to
the
right
point
now
and
the
doudevilles
on
their
side
must
have
been
busy
we
shall
have
some
fun
he
flung
out
his
fists
to
right
and
left
brought
them
back
to
his
chest
then
flung
them
out
again
and
brought
them
back
again
this
movement
which
executed
thirty
times
in
succession
was
followed
by
a
bending
of
his
body
backwards
and
forwards
next
came
an
alternate
lifting
of
the
legs
and
then
an
alternate
swinging
of
the
arms
the
whole
performance
occupied
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
quarter
of
an
hour
which
he
devoted
every
morning
to
swedish
exercises
to
keep
his
muscles
in
condition
then
he
sat
down
to
his
table
took
up
some
sheets
of
white
paper
which
were
arranged
in
numbered
packets
and
folding
one
of
them
made
it
into
an
envelope
a
work
which
he
continued
to
do
with
a
series
of
successive
sheets
it
was
the
task
which
he
had
accepted
and
which
he
forced
himself
to
do
daily
the
prisoners
having
the
right
to
choose
the
labor
which
they
preferred
sticking
envelopes
making
paper
fans
metal
purses
and
so
on
and
in
this
way
while
occupying
his
hands
with
an
automatic
exercise
and
keeping
his
muscles
supple
with
mechanical
bendings
lupin
was
able
to
have
his
thoughts
constantly
fixed
on
his
affairs
and
his
affairs
were
complicated
enough
in
all
conscience
there
was
one
for
instance
which
surpassed
all
the
others
in
importance
and
for
which
he
had
to
employ
all
the
resources
of
his
genius
how
was
he
to
have
a
long
quiet
conversation
with
old
steinweg
the
necessity
was
immediate
in
a
few
days
steinweg
would
have
recovered
from
his
imprisonment
would
receive
interviews
might
blab
to
say
nothing
of
the
inevitable
interference
of
the
enemy
other
one
and
it
was
essential
that
steinweg
secret
pierre
secret
should
be
revealed
to
no
one
but
lupin
once
published
the
secret
lost
all
its
value
the
bolts
grated
the
key
turned
noisily
in
the
lock
ah
it
you
most
excellent
of
jailers
has
the
moment
come
for
the
last
toilet
the
that
precedes
the
great
final
cut
of
all
magistrate
examination
said
the
man
laconically
lupin
walked
through
the
corridors
of
the
prison
and
was
received
by
the
municipal
guards
who
locked
him
into
the
he
reached
the
palais
de
justice
twenty
minutes
later
one
of
the
doudevilles
was
waiting
near
the
stairs
as
they
went
up
he
said
to
lupin
you
be
confronted
everything
settled
yes
weber
busy
elsewhere
lupin
walked
into
formerie
room
and
at
once
recognized
old
steinweg
sitting
on
a
chair
looking
ill
and
wretched
a
municipal
guard
was
standing
behind
him
formerie
scrutinized
the
prisoner
attentively
as
though
he
hoped
to
draw
important
conclusions
from
his
contemplation
of
him
and
said
you
know
who
this
gentleman
is
why
steinweg
of
course
yes
thanks
to
the
active
inquiries
of
weber
and
of
his
two
officers
the
brothers
doudeville
we
have
found
steinweg
who
according
to
you
knows
the
ins
and
outs
of
the
kesselbach
case
the
name
of
the
murderer
and
all
the
rest
of
it
i
congratulate
you
monsieur
le
juge
your
examination
will
go
swimmingly
i
think
so
there
is
only
one
steinweg
refuses
to
reveal
anything
except
in
your
presence
well
i
never
how
odd
of
him
does
arsène
lupin
inspire
him
with
so
much
affection
and
esteem
not
arsène
lupin
but
prince
sernine
who
he
says
saved
his
life
and
lenormand
with
whom
he
says
he
began
a
conversation
at
the
time
when
i
was
chief
of
the
lupin
broke
in
so
you
consent
to
admit
steinweg
said
the
magistrate
do
you
recognize
m
lenormand
no
but
i
know
that
arsène
lupin
and
he
are
one
so
you
consent
to
speak
yes
but
we
are
not
alone
how
do
you
mean
there
is
only
my
clerk
here
and
the
guard
monsieur
le
juge
the
secret
which
i
am
about
to
reveal
is
so
important
that
you
yourself
would
be
sorry
guard
go
outside
please
said
formerie
come
back
at
once
if
i
call
do
you
object
to
my
clerk
steinweg
no
no
it
might
be
better
but
however
then
speak
for
that
matter
nothing
that
you
reveal
will
be
put
down
in
black
on
white
one
word
more
though
i
ask
you
for
the
last
time
is
it
indispensable
that
the
prisoner
should
be
present
at
this
interview
quite
indispensable
you
will
see
the
reason
for
yourself
he
drew
the
chair
up
to
the
magistrate
desk
lupin
remained
standing
near
the
clerk
and
the
old
man
speaking
in
a
loud
voice
said
it
is
now
ten
years
since
a
series
of
circumstances
which
i
need
not
enter
into
made
me
acquainted
with
an
extraordinary
story
in
which
two
persons
are
concerned
their
names
please
i
will
give
the
names
presently
for
the
moment
let
me
say
that
one
of
these
persons
occupies
an
exceptional
position
in
france
and
that
the
other
an
italian
or
rather
a
spaniard
yes
a
spaniard
a
bound
across
the
room
followed
by
two
formidable
blows
of
the
fist
lupin
two
arms
had
darted
out
to
right
and
left
as
though
impelled
by
springs
and
his
two
fists
hard
as
cannon
balls
caught
the
magistrate
and
his
clerk
on
the
jaw
just
below
the
ear
the
magistrate
and
the
clerk
collapsed
over
their
tables
in
two
lumps
without
a
moan
well
hit
said
lupin
that
was
a
neat
bit
of
work
he
went
to
the
door
and
locked
it
softly
then
returning
steinweg
have
you
the
chloroform
are
you
quite
sure
that
they
have
fainted
asks
the
old
man
trembling
with
fear
what
do
you
think
but
it
will
only
last
for
three
or
four
minutes
and
that
is
not
long
enough
the
german
produced
from
his
pocket
a
bottle
and
two
pads
of
ready
prepared
lupin
uncorked
the
bottle
poured
a
few
drops
of
the
chloroform
on
the
two
pads
and
held
them
to
the
noses
of
the
magistrate
and
his
clerk
capital
we
have
ten
minutes
of
peace
and
quiet
before
us
that
will
do
but
let
make
haste
all
the
same
and
not
a
word
too
much
old
man
do
you
hear
he
took
him
by
the
arm
you
see
what
i
am
able
to
do
here
we
are
alone
in
the
very
heart
of
the
palais
de
justice
because
i
wished
it
yes
said
the
old
man
so
you
are
going
to
tell
me
your
secret
yes
i
told
it
to
kesselbach
because
he
was
rich
and
could
turn
it
to
better
account
than
anybody
i
knew
but
prisoner
and
absolutely
powerless
though
you
are
i
consider
you
a
hundred
times
as
strong
as
kesselbach
with
his
hundred
millions
in
that
case
speak
and
let
us
take
things
in
their
proper
order
the
name
of
the
murderer
that
impossible
how
do
you
mean
impossible
i
thought
you
knew
it
and
were
going
to
tell
me
everything
everything
but
not
that
but
later
on
you
mad
why
i
have
no
proofs
later
when
you
are
free
we
will
hunt
together
besides
what
the
good
and
then
really
i
ca
tell
you
you
afraid
of
him
yes
very
well
said
lupin
after
all
that
not
the
most
urgent
matter
as
to
the
rest
you
made
up
your
mind
to
speak
without
reserve
well
then
answer
who
is
pierre
leduc
hermann
grand
duke
of
prince
of
berncastel
count
of
fistingen
lord
of
wiesbaden
and
other
places
lupin
felt
a
thrill
of
joy
at
learning
that
his
was
definitely
not
the
son
of
a
the
devil
he
muttered
so
we
have
a
handle
to
our
name
as
far
as
i
remember
the
of
is
in
prussia
yes
on
the
moselle
the
house
of
veldenz
is
a
branch
of
the
palatine
house
of
zweibrucken
the
was
occupied
by
the
french
after
the
peace
of
luneville
and
formed
part
of
the
department
of
in
it
was
restored
in
favor
of
hermann
the
great
grandfather
of
pierre
leduc
his
son
hermann
spent
a
riotous
youth
ruined
himself
squandered
the
finances
of
his
country
and
made
himself
impossible
to
his
subjects
who
ended
by
partly
burning
the
old
castle
at
veldenz
and
driving
their
sovereign
out
of
his
dominions
the
was
then
administered
and
governed
by
three
regents
in
the
name
of
hermann
who
by
a
curious
anomaly
did
not
abdicate
but
retained
his
title
as
reigning
he
lived
rather
short
of
cash
in
berlin
later
he
fought
in
the
french
war
by
the
side
of
bismarck
of
whom
he
was
a
friend
he
was
killed
by
a
shell
at
the
siege
of
paris
and
in
dying
entrusted
bismarck
with
the
charge
of
his
son
hermann
that
is
hermann
iii
the
father
therefore
of
our
leduc
said
lupin
yes
the
chancellor
took
a
liking
to
hermann
and
used
often
to
employ
him
as
a
secret
envoy
to
persons
of
distinction
abroad
at
the
fall
of
his
patron
hermann
left
berlin
travelled
about
and
returned
and
settled
in
dresden
when
bismarck
died
hermann
was
there
he
himself
died
two
years
later
these
are
public
facts
known
to
everybody
in
germany
and
that
is
the
story
of
the
three
hermanns
of
in
the
nineteenth
century
but
the
fourth
hermann
the
one
in
whom
we
are
interested
we
will
speak
of
him
presently
let
us
now
pass
on
to
unknown
facts
facts
known
to
you
alone
said
lupin
to
me
alone
and
to
a
few
others
how
do
you
mean
a
few
others
has
the
secret
been
kept
yes
yes
the
secret
has
been
well
kept
by
all
who
know
it
have
no
fear
it
is
very
much
to
their
interest
i
assure
you
not
to
divulge
it
then
how
do
you
know
it
through
an
old
servant
and
private
secretary
of
the
hermann
the
last
of
the
name
this
servant
who
died
in
my
arms
in
south
africa
began
by
confiding
to
me
that
his
master
was
secretly
married
and
had
left
a
son
behind
him
then
he
told
me
the
great
secret
the
one
which
you
afterwards
revealed
to
kesselbach
yes
one
second
will
you
excuse
me
lupin
bent
over
formerie
satisfied
himself
that
all
was
well
and
the
heart
beating
normally
and
said
go
on
steinweg
resumed
on
the
evening
of
the
day
on
which
bismarck
died
the
hermann
iii
and
his
faithful
manservant
my
south
african
friend
took
a
train
which
brought
them
to
munich
in
time
to
catch
the
express
for
vienna
from
vienna
they
went
to
constantinople
then
to
cairo
then
to
naples
then
to
tunis
then
to
spain
then
to
paris
then
to
london
to
petersburg
to
warsaw
and
in
none
of
these
towns
did
they
stop
they
took
a
cab
had
their
two
bags
put
on
the
top
rushed
through
the
streets
hurried
to
another
station
or
to
the
and
once
more
took
the
train
or
the
steamer
in
short
they
were
being
followed
and
were
trying
to
put
their
pursuers
off
the
scent
arsène
lupin
concluded
one
evening
they
left
the
city
of
treves
dressed
in
workmen
caps
and
linen
jackets
each
with
a
bundle
slung
over
his
shoulder
at
the
end
of
a
stick
they
covered
on
foot
the
miles
to
veldenz
where
the
old
castle
of
zweibrucken
stands
or
rather
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
no
descriptions
please
all
day
long
they
remained
hidden
in
a
neighboring
forest
at
night
they
went
up
to
the
old
walls
hermann
ordered
his
servant
to
wait
for
him
and
himself
scaled
the
wall
at
a
breach
known
as
the
wolf
gap
he
returned
in
an
hour
time
in
the
following
week
after
more
peregrinations
he
went
back
home
to
dresden
the
expedition
was
over
and
what
was
the
object
of
the
expedition
the
never
breathed
a
word
about
it
to
his
servant
but
certain
particulars
and
the
coincidence
of
facts
that
ensued
enabled
the
man
to
build
up
the
truth
at
least
in
part
quick
steinweg
time
is
running
short
now
and
i
am
eager
to
know
a
fortnight
after
the
expedition
count
von
waldemar
an
officer
in
the
emperor
and
one
of
his
personal
friends
called
on
the
accompanied
by
six
men
he
was
there
all
day
locked
up
with
the
in
his
study
there
were
repeated
sounds
of
altercations
of
violent
disputes
one
phrase
even
was
overheard
by
the
servant
who
was
passing
through
the
garden
under
the
windows
papers
were
handed
to
you
his
imperial
majesty
is
sure
of
it
if
you
refuse
to
give
them
to
me
of
your
own
free
will
the
rest
of
the
sentence
the
meaning
of
the
threat
and
for
that
matter
the
whole
scene
can
be
easily
guessed
by
what
followed
hermann
house
was
ransacked
from
top
to
bottom
but
that
is
against
the
law
it
would
have
been
against
the
law
if
the
had
objected
but
he
himself
accompanied
the
count
in
his
search
and
what
were
they
looking
for
the
chancellor
memoirs
something
better
than
that
they
were
looking
for
a
parcel
of
secret
documents
which
were
known
to
exist
owing
to
indiscretions
that
had
been
committed
and
which
were
known
for
certain
to
have
been
entrusted
to
the
hermann
keeping
lupin
muttered
excitedly
secret
documents
and
very
important
ones
no
doubt
of
the
highest
importance
the
publication
of
those
papers
would
lead
to
results
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
foresee
not
only
from
the
point
of
view
of
home
politics
but
also
from
that
of
relations
with
the
foreign
powers
oh
said
lupin
throbbing
with
emotion
oh
can
it
be
possible
what
proof
have
you
what
proof
the
evidence
of
the
wife
the
confidences
which
she
made
to
the
servant
after
her
husband
death
yes
yes
stammered
lupin
we
have
the
evidence
of
the
himself
better
still
said
steinweg
what
a
document
a
document
written
in
his
own
hand
signed
by
him
and
containing
containing
what
a
list
of
the
secret
papers
confided
to
his
charge
tell
me
in
two
words
in
two
words
that
ca
be
done
the
document
is
a
very
long
one
scattered
all
over
with
annotations
and
remarks
which
are
sometimes
impossible
to
understand
let
me
mention
just
two
titles
which
obviously
refer
to
two
bundles
of
secret
papers
letters
of
the
crown
prince
to
is
one
the
dates
show
that
these
letters
were
written
during
the
three
months
of
the
reign
of
frederick
iii
to
picture
what
the
letters
may
contain
you
have
only
to
think
of
the
emperor
frederick
illness
his
quarrels
with
his
son
yes
yes
i
know
and
the
other
title
of
the
letters
of
frederick
and
the
empress
victoria
to
the
queen
of
do
you
mean
to
say
that
that
there
asked
lupin
in
a
choking
voice
listen
to
the
notes
of
the
treaty
with
great
britain
and
and
these
rather
obscure
words
colonies
limitation
of
naval
armaments
it
says
that
blurted
lupin
and
you
call
that
obscure
why
the
words
are
dazzling
with
light
oh
can
it
be
possible
and
what
next
what
next
as
he
spoke
there
was
a
noise
at
the
door
some
one
was
knocking
you
ca
come
in
said
lupin
i
am
busy
go
on
steinweg
but
said
the
old
man
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
the
door
was
shaken
violently
and
lupin
recognized
weber
voice
he
shouted
a
little
patience
weber
i
shall
have
done
in
five
minutes
he
gripped
the
old
man
arm
and
in
a
tone
of
command
be
easy
and
go
on
with
your
story
so
according
to
you
the
expedition
of
the
grand
duke
and
his
servant
to
veldenz
castle
had
no
other
object
than
to
hide
those
papers
there
can
be
no
question
about
that
very
well
but
the
may
have
taken
them
away
since
no
he
did
not
leave
dresden
until
his
death
but
the
enemies
the
men
who
had
everything
to
gain
by
recovering
them
and
destroying
them
ca
they
have
tried
to
find
out
where
the
papers
were
they
have
tried
how
do
you
know
you
can
understand
that
i
did
not
remain
inactive
and
that
my
first
care
after
receiving
those
revelations
was
to
go
to
veldenz
and
make
inquiries
for
myself
in
the
neighboring
villages
well
i
learnt
that
on
two
separate
occasions
the
castle
was
invaded
by
a
dozen
men
who
came
from
berlin
furnished
with
credentials
to
the
regents
well
well
they
found
nothing
for
since
that
time
the
castle
has
been
found
closed
to
the
public
but
what
prevents
anybody
from
getting
in
a
garrison
of
fifty
soldiers
who
keep
watch
day
and
night
soldiers
of
the
no
soldiers
drafted
from
the
emperor
own
the
din
in
the
passage
increased
open
the
door
a
voice
cried
i
order
you
to
open
the
door
i
ca
weber
old
chap
the
lock
has
stuck
if
you
take
my
advice
you
had
better
cut
the
door
all
round
the
lock
open
the
door
and
what
about
the
fate
of
europe
which
we
are
discussing
he
turned
to
the
old
man
so
you
were
not
able
to
enter
the
castle
no
but
you
are
persuaded
that
the
papers
in
question
are
hidden
there
look
here
have
i
given
you
proofs
enough
are
you
convinced
yes
yes
muttered
lupin
that
where
they
are
hidden
no
doubt
about
it
that
where
they
are
hidden
he
seemed
to
see
the
castle
he
seemed
to
conjure
up
the
mysterious
and
the
vision
of
an
inexhaustible
treasure
the
dream
of
chests
filled
with
riches
and
precious
stones
could
not
have
excited
him
more
than
the
idea
of
those
few
scraps
of
paper
watched
over
by
the
kaiser
guards
what
a
wonderful
conquest
to
embark
upon
and
how
worthy
of
his
powers
and
what
a
proof
of
perspicacity
and
intuition
he
had
once
more
given
by
throwing
himself
at
a
venture
upon
that
unknown
track
outside
the
men
were
working
at
the
lock
lupin
asked
of
old
steinweg
what
did
the
die
of
an
attack
of
pleurisy
which
carried
him
off
in
a
few
days
he
hardly
recovered
consciousness
before
the
end
and
the
horrible
thing
appears
to
have
been
that
he
was
seen
to
make
violent
efforts
between
his
fits
of
delirium
to
collect
his
thoughts
and
utter
connected
words
from
time
to
time
he
called
his
wife
looked
at
her
in
a
desperate
way
and
vainly
moved
his
lips
in
a
word
he
spoke
said
lupin
cutting
him
short
for
the
working
at
the
lock
was
beginning
to
make
him
anxious
no
he
did
not
speak
but
in
a
comparatively
lucid
moment
he
summoned
up
the
energy
to
make
some
marks
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
his
wife
gave
him
well
those
marks
they
were
illegible
for
the
most
part
for
the
most
part
but
the
others
asked
lupin
greedily
the
others
there
were
first
three
perfectly
distinct
figures
an
a
and
a
yes
i
know
and
next
and
next
there
were
some
letters
several
letters
of
which
all
that
can
be
made
out
for
certain
are
a
group
of
three
followed
immediately
after
by
a
group
of
two
letters
on
is
that
it
oh
so
you
know
the
lock
was
yielding
almost
all
the
screws
had
been
taken
out
lupin
suddenly
alarmed
at
the
thought
of
being
interrupted
asked
so
that
this
incomplete
word
on
and
the
number
are
the
formulas
which
the
bequeathed
to
his
wife
and
son
to
enable
them
to
find
the
secret
papers
yes
what
became
of
the
wife
she
died
soon
after
her
husband
of
grief
one
might
say
and
was
the
child
looked
after
by
the
family
what
family
the
had
no
brothers
or
sisters
moreover
he
was
only
morganatically
and
secretly
married
no
the
child
was
taken
away
by
hermann
old
who
brought
him
up
under
the
name
of
pierre
leduc
he
was
a
bad
type
of
boy
capricious
and
troublesome
one
day
he
went
off
and
was
never
seen
again
did
he
know
the
secret
of
his
birth
yes
and
he
was
shown
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
hermann
iii
had
written
the
letters
and
figures
and
after
that
this
revelation
was
made
to
no
one
but
yourself
that
all
and
you
confided
only
in
mr
kesselbach
yes
but
out
of
prudence
while
showing
him
the
sheet
of
letters
and
figures
and
the
list
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
i
kept
both
those
documents
in
my
own
possession
events
have
proved
that
i
was
right
lupin
was
now
clinging
to
the
door
with
both
hands
weber
he
roared
you
very
indiscreet
i
shall
report
you
steinweg
have
you
those
documents
yes
are
they
in
a
safe
place
absolutely
in
paris
no
so
much
the
better
do
forget
that
your
life
is
in
danger
and
that
you
have
people
after
you
i
know
the
least
false
step
and
i
am
done
for
exactly
so
take
your
precautions
throw
the
enemy
off
the
scent
go
and
fetch
your
papers
and
await
my
instructions
the
thing
is
cut
and
dried
in
a
month
at
latest
we
will
go
to
veldenz
castle
together
suppose
i
in
prison
i
will
take
you
out
can
you
the
very
day
after
i
come
out
myself
no
i
wrong
the
same
evening
an
hour
later
you
have
the
means
since
the
last
ten
minutes
an
infallible
means
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
to
me
no
then
i
open
the
door
he
pulled
back
the
door
and
bowing
to
weber
my
poor
old
weber
i
do
know
what
excuse
to
make
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
the
sudden
inrush
of
the
and
three
policeman
left
him
no
time
weber
was
white
with
rage
and
indignation
the
sight
of
the
two
men
lying
outstretched
quite
unsettled
him
dead
he
exclaimed
not
a
bit
of
it
not
a
bit
of
it
chuckled
lupin
only
asleep
formerie
was
tired
out
so
i
allowed
him
a
few
moments
rest
enough
of
this
humbug
shouted
weber
and
turning
to
the
policemen
take
him
back
to
the
santé
and
keep
your
eyes
open
damn
it
as
for
this
visitor
lupin
learnt
nothing
more
as
to
weber
intentions
with
regard
to
old
steinweg
a
crowd
of
municipal
guards
and
police
constables
hustled
him
down
to
the
on
the
stairs
doudeville
whispered
weber
had
a
line
to
warn
him
it
told
him
to
mind
the
confrontation
and
to
be
on
his
guard
with
steinweg
the
note
was
signed
but
lupin
hardly
bothered
his
head
about
all
this
what
did
he
care
for
the
murderer
hatred
or
old
steinweg
fate
he
possessed
rudolf

secret
chapter
x
lupin
great
scheme
contrary
to
his
expectations
lupin
had
no
sort
of
annoyance
to
undergo
in
consequence
of
his
assault
on
formerie
the
came
to
the
santé
in
person
two
days
later
and
told
him
with
some
embarrassment
and
with
an
affectation
of
kindness
that
he
did
not
intend
to
pursue
the
matter
further
nor
i
either
retorted
lupin
what
do
you
mean
well
i
mean
that
i
shall
send
no
communication
to
the
press
about
this
particular
matter
nor
do
anything
that
might
expose
you
to
ridicule
monsieur
le
juge
the
scandal
shall
not
be
made
public
i
promise
that
is
what
you
want
is
it
not
formerie
blushed
and
without
replying
continued
only
henceforth
your
examinations
will
take
place
here
it
quite
right
that
the
law
should
put
itself
out
for
lupin
said
that
gentleman
the
announcement
of
this
decision
which
interrupted
his
almost
daily
meetings
with
the
doudevilles
did
not
disturb
lupin
he
had
taken
his
precautions
from
the
first
day
by
giving
the
doudevilles
all
the
necessary
instructions
and
now
that
the
preparations
were
nearly
completed
reckoned
upon
being
able
to
turn
old
steinweg
confidences
to
the
best
account
without
delay
and
to
obtain
his
liberty
by
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
and
ingenious
schemes
that
had
ever
entered
his
brain
his
method
of
correspondence
was
a
simple
one
and
he
had
devised
it
at
once
every
morning
he
was
supplied
with
sheets
of
paper
in
numbered
packets
he
made
these
into
envelopes
and
every
evening
the
envelopes
duly
folded
and
gummed
were
fetched
away
now
lupin
noticing
that
his
packet
always
bore
the
same
number
had
drawn
the
inference
that
the
distribution
of
the
numbered
packets
was
always
affected
in
the
same
order
among
the
prisoners
who
had
chosen
that
particular
kind
of
work
experience
showed
that
he
was
right
it
only
remained
for
the
doudevilles
to
bribe
one
of
the
employees
of
the
private
firm
entrusted
with
the
supply
and
dispatch
of
the
envelopes
this
was
easily
done
and
thenceforward
lupin
sure
of
success
had
only
to
wait
quietly
until
the
sign
agreed
upon
between
him
and
his
friends
appeared
upon
the
top
sheet
of
the
packet
on
the
sixth
day
he
gave
an
exclamation
of
delight
at
last
he
said
he
took
a
tiny
bottle
from
a
uncorked
it
moistened
the
tip
of
his
forefinger
with
the
liquid
which
it
contained
and
passed
his
finger
over
the
third
sheet
in
the
packet
in
a
moment
strokes
appeared
then
letters
then
words
and
sentences
he
read
all
well

there
every

no

so
communications
were
established
with
the
outside
once
more
efforts
were
crowned
with
success
all
that
he
had
to
do
now
was
to
execute
his
plan
and
lead
the
press
campaign
which
he
had
prepared
in
the
peaceful
solitude
of
his
prison
three
days
later
these
few
lines
appeared
in
the
quite
apart
from
prince
bismarck
which
according
to
people
contain
merely
the
official
history
of
the
events
in
which
the
great
chancellor
was
concerned
there
exists
a
series
of
confidential
letters
of
no
little
interest
these
letters
have
been
recently
discovered
we
hear
on
good
authority
that
they
will
be
published
almost
immediately
my
readers
will
remember
the
noise
which
these
mysterious
sentences
made
throughout
the
civilized
world
the
comments
in
which
people
indulged
the
suggestions
put
forward
and
in
particular
the
controversy
that
followed
in
the
german
press
who
had
inspired
those
lines
what
were
the
letters
in
question
who
had
written
them
to
the
chancellor
or
who
had
received
them
from
him
was
it
an
act
of
posthumous
revenge
or
was
it
an
indiscretion
committed
by
one
of
bismarck
correspondents
a
second
note
settled
public
opinion
as
to
certain
points
but
at
the
same
time
worked
it
up
to
a
strange
pitch
of
excitement
it
ran
as
follows
the
editor
of
the
grand
santé
palace
cell
second
division
sir
you
inserted
in
your
issue
of
tuesday
last
a
paragraph
based
upon
a
few
words
which
i
let
fall
the
other
evening
in
the
course
of
a
lecture
which
i
was
delivering
at
the
santé
on
foreign
politics
your
correspondent
paragraph
although
accurate
in
all
essential
particulars
requires
a
slight
correction
the
letters
exist
as
stated
and
it
is
impossible
to
deny
their
exceptional
importance
seeing
that
for
ten
years
they
have
been
the
object
of
an
uninterrupted
search
on
the
part
of
the
government
interested
but
nobody
knows
where
they
are
hidden
and
nobody
knows
a
single
word
of
what
they
contain
the
public
i
am
convinced
will
bear
me
no
if
i
keep
it
waiting
for
some
time
before
satisfying
its
legitimate
curiosity
apart
from
the
fact
that
i
am
not
in
possession
of
all
the
elements
necessary
for
the
pursuit
of
the
truth
my
present
occupation
does
not
allow
me
to
devote
so
much
time
as
i
could
wish
to
this
matter
all
that
i
can
say
for
the
moment
is
that
the
letters
were
entrusted
by
the
dying
statesman
to
one
of
his
most
faithful
friends
and
that
this
friend
had
eventually
to
suffer
the
serious
consequences
of
his
loyalty
constant
spying
domiciliary
visits
nothing
was
spared
him
i
have
given
orders
to
two
of
the
best
agents
of
my
secret
police
to
take
up
this
scent
from
the
start
in
a
position
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
exciting
mystery
i
have
the
honor
to
be
sir
your
obedient
servant
arsène
lupin
so
it
was
arsène
lupin
who
was
conducting
the
case
it
was
he
who
from
his
prison
cell
was
the
comedy
or
the
tragedy
announced
in
the
first
note
what
luck
everybody
was
delighted
with
an
artist
like
lupin
the
spectacle
could
not
fail
to
be
both
picturesque
and
startling
three
days
later
the
contained
the
following
letter
from
arsène
lupin
the
name
of
the
devoted
friend
to
whom
i
referred
has
been
imparted
to
me
it
was
the
hermann
reigning
although
dispossessed
sovereign
of
the
of
and
a
confidant
of
prince
bismarck
whose
entire
friendship
he
enjoyed
a
thorough
search
was
made
of
his
house
by
count
von
w
at
the
head
of
twelve
men
the
result
of
this
search
was
purely
negative
but
the
was
nevertheless
proved
to
be
in
possession
of
the
papers
where
had
he
hidden
them
this
was
a
problem
which
probably
nobody
in
the
world
would
be
able
to
solve
at
the
present
moment
i
must
ask
for
hours
in
which
to
solve
it
arsène
lupin
and
hours
later
the
promised
note
appeared
the
famous
letters
are
hidden
in
the
feudal
castle
of
veldenz
the
capital
of
the
of
zweibrucken
the
castle
was
partly
destroyed
in
the
course
of
the
nineteenth
century
where
exactly
are
they
hidden
and
what
are
the
letters
precisely
these
are
the
two
problems
which
i
am
now
engaged
in
unravelling
and
i
shall
publish
the
solution
in
four
days
time
arsène
lupin
on
the
day
stated
men
scrambled
to
obtain
copies
of
the
to
the
general
disappointment
the
promised
information
was
not
given
the
same
silence
followed
on
the
next
day
and
the
day
after
what
had
happened
it
leaked
out
through
an
indiscretion
at
the
prefecture
of
police
the
governor
of
the
santé
it
appeared
had
been
warned
that
lupin
was
communicating
with
his
accomplices
by
means
of
the
packets
of
envelopes
which
he
made
nothing
had
been
discovered
but
it
was
thought
best
in
any
case
to
forbid
all
work
to
the
insufferable
prisoner
to
this
the
insufferable
prisoner
replied
as
i
have
nothing
to
do
now
i
may
as
well
attend
to
my
trial
please
let
my
counsel
maître
quimbel
know
it
was
true
lupin
who
hitherto
had
refused
to
hold
any
intercourse
with
maître
quimbel
now
consented
to
see
him
and
to
prepare
his
defence
on
the
next
day
maître
quimbel
in
cheery
tones
asked
for
lupin
to
be
brought
to
the
barristers
room
he
was
an
elderly
man
wearing
a
pair
of
very
powerful
spectacles
which
made
his
eyes
seem
enormous
he
put
his
hat
on
the
table
spread
out
his
and
at
once
began
to
put
a
series
of
questions
which
he
had
carefully
prepared
lupin
replied
with
extreme
readiness
and
even
volunteered
a
host
of
particulars
which
maître
quimbel
took
down
as
he
spoke
on
slips
pinned
one
to
the
other
and
so
you
say
continued
the
barrister
with
his
head
over
his
papers
that
at
that
time
i
say
that
at
that
time
lupin
answered
little
by
little
with
a
series
of
natural
and
hardly
perceptible
movements
he
leant
elbows
on
the
table
he
gradually
lowered
his
arms
slipped
his
hand
under
maître
quimbel
hat
put
his
finger
into
the
leather
band
and
took
out
one
of
those
strips
of
paper
folded
lengthwise
which
the
hatter
inserts
between
the
leather
and
the
lining
when
the
hat
is
a
trifle
too
large
he
unfolded
the
paper
it
was
a
message
from
doudeville
written
in
a
cipher
agreed
upon
beforehand
i
am
engaged
as
indoor
servant
at
maître
quimbel
you
can
answer
by
the
same
means
without
fear
it
was
the
murderer
who
gave
away
the
envelope
trick
a
good
thing
that
you
foresaw
this
move
hereupon
followed
a
minute
report
of
all
the
facts
and
comments
caused
by
lupin
revelations
lupin
took
from
his
pocket
a
similar
strip
of
paper
containing
his
instructions
quietly
substituted
it
in
the
place
of
the
other
and
drew
his
hand
back
again
the
trick
was
played
and
lupin
correspondence
with
the
was
resumed
without
further
delay
i
apologize
to
the
public
for
not
keeping
my
promise
the
postal
arrangements
at
the
santé
palace
are
woefully
inadequate
however
we
are
near
the
end
i
have
in
hand
all
the
documents
that
establish
the
truth
upon
an
indisputable
basis
i
shall
not
publish
them
for
the
moment
nevertheless
i
will
say
this
among
the
letters
are
some
that
were
addressed
to
the
chancellor
by
one
who
at
that
time
declared
himself
his
disciple
and
his
admirer
and
who
was
destined
several
years
after
to
rid
himself
of
that
irksome
tutor
and
to
govern
alone
i
trust
that
i
make
myself
sufficiently
clear
and
on
the
next
day
the
letters
were
written
during
the
late
illness
i
need
hardly
add
more
to
prove
their
importance
four
days
of
silence
and
then
this
final
note
which
caused
a
stir
that
has
not
yet
been
forgotten
my
investigation
is
finished
i
now
know
everything
by
dint
of
reflection
i
have
guessed
the
secret
of
the
my
friends
are
going
to
veldenz
and
in
spite
of
every
obstacle
will
enter
the
castle
by
a
way
which
i
am
pointing
out
to
them
the
newspapers
will
then
publish
photographs
of
the
letters
of
which
i
already
know
the
tenor
but
i
prefer
to
reproduce
the
whole
text
this
certain
inevitable
publication
will
take
place
in
a
fortnight
from
precisely
on
the
of
august
next
between
this
and
then
i
will
keep
silence
and
wait
the
communications
to
the
did
in
fact
stop
for
a
time
but
lupin
never
ceased
corresponding
with
his
friends
the
hat
as
they
said
among
themselves
it
was
so
simple
there
was
no
danger
who
could
ever
suspect
that
maître
quimbel
hat
served
lupin
as
a
every
two
or
three
mornings
whenever
he
called
in
fact
the
celebrated
advocate
faithfully
brought
his
client
letters
letters
from
paris
letters
from
the
country
letters
from
germany
all
reduced
and
condensed
by
doudeville
into
a
brief
form
and
cipher
language
and
an
hour
later
maître
quimbel
solemnly
walked
away
carrying
orders
now
one
day
the
governor
of
the
santé
received
a
telephone
message
signed
informing
him
that
maître
quimbel
was
in
all
probability
serving
lupin
as
his
unwitting
postman
and
that
it
would
be
advisable
to
keep
an
eye
upon
the
worthy
man
visits
the
governor
told
maître
quimbel
who
thereupon
resolved
to
bring
his
junior
with
him
so
once
again
in
spite
of
all
lupin
efforts
in
spite
of
his
fertile
powers
of
invention
in
spite
of
the
marvels
of
ingenuity
which
he
renewed
after
each
defeat
once
again
lupin
found
himself
cut
off
from
communication
with
the
outside
world
by
the
infernal
genius
of
his
formidable
adversary
and
he
found
himself
thus
cut
off
at
the
most
critical
moment
at
the
solemn
minute
when
from
his
cell
he
was
playing
his
last
against
the
coalesced
forces
that
were
overwhelming
him
so
terribly
on
the
of
august
as
he
sat
facing
the
two
counsels
his
attention
was
attracted
by
a
newspaper
in
which
some
of
maître
quimbel
papers
were
wrapped
up
he
saw
a
heading
in
very
large
type
the
were
a
fresh
murder
the
excitement
in
germany
has
the
secret
of
the
been
discovered
lupin
turned
pale
with
anguish
below
he
read
the
words
two
sensational
telegrams
reach
us
at
the
moment
of
going
to
press
the
body
of
an
old
man
has
been
found
near
augsburg
with
his
throat
cut
with
a
knife
the
police
have
succeeded
in
identifying
the
victim
it
is
steinweg
the
man
mentioned
in
the
kesselbach
case
on
the
other
hand
a
correspondent
telegraphs
that
the
famous
english
detective
holmlock
shears
has
been
hurriedly
summoned
to
cologne
he
will
there
meet
the
emperor
and
they
will
both
proceed
to
veldenz
castle
holmlock
shears
is
said
to
have
undertaken
to
discover
the
secret
of
the
if
he
succeeds
it
will
mean
the
pitiful
failure
of
the
incomprehensible
campaign
which
arsène
lupin
has
been
conducting
for
the
past
month
in
so
strange
a
fashion
perhaps
public
curiosity
was
never
so
much
stirred
as
by
the
duel
announced
to
take
place
between
shears
and
lupin
an
invisible
duel
in
the
circumstances
an
anonymous
duel
one
might
say
in
which
everything
would
happen
in
the
dark
in
which
people
would
be
able
to
judge
only
by
the
final
results
and
yet
an
impressive
duel
because
of
all
the
scandal
that
circled
around
the
adventure
and
because
of
the
stakes
in
dispute
between
the
two
irreconcilable
enemies
now
once
more
opposed
to
each
other
and
it
was
a
question
not
of
small
private
interests
of
insignificant
burglaries
of
trumpery
individual
passions
but
of
a
matter
of
really
importance
involving
the
politics
of
the
three
great
western
nations
and
capable
of
disturbing
the
peace
of
the
world
people
waited
anxiously
and
no
one
knew
exactly
what
he
was
waiting
for
for
after
all
if
the
detective
came
out
victorious
in
the
duel
if
he
found
the
letters
who
would
ever
know
what
proof
would
any
one
have
of
his
triumph
in
the
main
all
hopes
were
centred
on
lupin
on
his
habit
of
calling
the
public
to
witness
his
acts
what
was
he
going
to
do
how
could
he
avert
the
frightful
danger
that
threatened
him
was
he
even
aware
of
it
those
were
the
questions
which
men
asked
themselves
between
the
four
walls
of
his
cell
prisoner
asked
himself
pretty
nearly
the
same
questions
and
he
for
his
part
was
not
stimulated
by
idle
curiosity
but
by
real
uneasiness
by
constant
anxiety
he
felt
himself
irrevocably
alone
with
impotent
hands
an
impotent
will
an
impotent
brain
it
availed
him
nothing
that
he
was
able
ingenious
fearless
heroic
the
struggle
was
being
carried
on
without
him
his
part
was
now
finished
he
had
joined
all
the
pieces
and
set
all
the
springs
of
the
great
machine
that
was
to
produce
that
was
in
a
manner
of
speaking
automatically
to
manufacture
his
liberty
and
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
make
a
single
movement
to
improve
and
supervise
his
handiwork
at
the
date
fixed
the
machine
would
start
working
between
now
and
then
a
thousand
adverse
incidents
might
spring
up
a
thousand
obstacles
arise
without
his
having
the
means
to
combat
those
incidents
or
remove
those
obstacles
lupin
spent
the
unhappiest
hours
of
his
life
at
that
time
he
doubted
himself
he
wondered
whether
his
existence
would
be
buried
for
good
in
the
horror
of
a
jail
had
he
not
made
a
mistake
in
his
calculations
was
it
not
childish
to
believe
that
the
event
that
was
to
set
him
free
would
happen
on
the
appointed
date
madness
he
cried
my
argument
is
false
how
can
i
expect
such
a
concurrence
of
circumstances
there
will
be
some
little
fact
that
will
destroy
all
the
inevitable
grain
of
sand
steinweg
death
and
the
disappearance
of
the
documents
which
the
old
man
was
to
make
over
to
him
did
not
trouble
him
greatly
the
documents
he
could
have
done
without
in
case
of
need
and
with
the
few
words
which
steinweg
had
told
him
he
was
able
by
dint
of
and
his
native
genius
to
reconstruct
what
the
emperor
letters
contained
and
to
draw
up
the
plan
of
battle
that
would
lead
to
victory
but
he
thought
of
holmlock
shears
who
was
over
there
now
in
the
very
centre
of
the
battlefield
and
who
was
seeking
and
who
would
find
the
letters
thus
demolishing
the
edifice
so
patiently
built
up
and
he
thought
of
the
other
one
the
implacable
enemy
lurking
round
the
prison
hidden
in
the
prison
perhaps
who
guessed
his
most
secret
plans
even
before
they
were
hatched
in
the
mystery
of
his
thought
the
of
august
the
of
august
the
two
more
days
two
centuries
rather
oh
the
interminable
minutes
lupin
usually
so
calm
so
entirely
master
of
himself
so
ingenious
at
providing
matter
for
his
own
amusement
was
feverish
exultant
and
depressed
by
turns
powerless
against
the
enemy
mistrusting
everything
and
everybody
morose
the
of
august
he
would
have
wished
to
act
and
he
could
not
whatever
he
did
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
hasten
the
hour
of
the
catastrophe
this
catastrophe
would
take
place
or
would
not
take
place
but
lupin
would
not
know
for
certain
until
the
last
hour
of
the
last
day
was
spent
to
the
last
minute
then
and
then
alone
he
would
know
of
the
definite
failure
of
his
scheme
the
inevitable
failure
he
kept
on
repeating
to
himself
success
depends
upon
circumstances
far
too
subtle
and
can
be
obtained
only
by
methods
far
too
psychological
there
is
no
doubt
that
i
am
deceiving
myself
as
to
the
value
and
the
range
of
my
weapons
and
yet
hope
returned
to
him
he
weighed
his
chances
they
suddenly
seemed
to
him
real
and
formidable
the
fact
was
going
to
happen
as
he
had
foreseen
it
happening
and
for
the
very
reasons
which
he
had
expected
it
was
inevitable
yes
inevitable
unless
indeed
shears
discovered
the
and
again
he
thought
of
shears
and
again
an
immense
sense
of
discouragement
overwhelmed
him
the
last
day
he
woke
late
after
a
night
of
bad
dreams
he
saw
nobody
that
day
neither
the
examining
magistrate
nor
his
counsel
the
afternoon
dragged
along
slowly
and
dismally
and
the
evening
came
the
murky
evening
of
the
cells
he
was
in
a
fever
his
heart
beat
in
his
chest
like
the
clapper
of
a
bell
and
the
minutes
passed
irretrievably
at
nine
nothing
at
ten
nothing
with
all
his
nerves
tense
as
the
string
of
a
bow
he
listened
to
the
vague
prison
sounds
tried
to
catch
through
those
inexorable
walls
all
that
might
trickle
in
from
the
life
outside
oh
how
he
would
have
liked
to
stay
the
march
of
time
and
to
give
destiny
a
little
more
leisure
but
what
was
the
good
was
everything
not
finished
oh
he
cried
i
am
going
mad
if
all
this
were
only
over
that
would
be
better
i
can
begin
again
differently
i
shall
try
something
else
but
i
ca
go
on
like
this
i
ca
go
on
he
held
his
head
in
his
hands
pressing
it
with
all
his
might
locking
himself
within
himself
and
concentrating
his
whole
mind
upon
one
subject
as
though
he
wished
to
provoke
as
though
he
wished
to
create
the
formidable
stupefying
inadmissible
event
to
which
he
had
attached
his
independence
and
his
fortune
it
must
happen
he
muttered
it
must
and
it
must
not
because
i
wish
it
but
because
it
is
logical
and
it
shall
happen
it
shall
happen
he
beat
his
skull
with
his
fists
and
delirious
words
rose
to
his
lips
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
in
his
frenzy
he
had
not
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
corridor
and
now
suddenly
a
ray
of
light
penetrated
into
his
cell
and
the
door
opened
three
men
entered
lupin
had
not
a
moment
of
surprise
the
miracle
was
being
worked
and
this
at
once
seemed
to
him
natural
and
normal
in
perfect
agreement
with
truth
and
justice
but
a
rush
of
pride
flooded
his
whole
being
at
this
minute
he
really
received
a
clear
sensation
of
his
own
strength
and
intelligence
shall
i
switch
on
the
light
asked
one
of
the
three
men
in
whom
lupin
recognized
the
governor
of
the
prison
no
replied
the
taller
of
his
companions
speaking
in
a
foreign
accent
this
lantern
will
do
shall
i
go
act
according
to
your
duty
sir
said
the
same
individual
my
instructions
from
the
prefect
of
police
are
to
comply
entirely
with
your
wishes
in
that
case
sir
it
would
be
preferable
that
you
should
withdraw
borély
went
away
leaving
the
door
half
open
and
remained
outside
within
call
the
visitor
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
one
who
had
not
yet
spoken
and
lupin
vainly
tried
to
distinguish
his
features
in
the
shade
he
saw
only
two
dark
forms
clad
in
wide
and
wearing
caps
with
the
flaps
lowered
are
you
arsène
lupin
asked
the
man
turning
the
light
of
the
lantern
full
on
his
face
he
smiled
yes
i
am
the
person
known
as
arsène
lupin
at
present
a
prisoner
in
the
santé
cell
second
division
was
it
you
continued
the
visitor
who
published
in
the
a
series
of
more
or
less
fanciful
notes
in
which
there
is
a
question
of
a
collection
of
letters
lupin
interrupted
him
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
but
before
pursuing
this
conversation
the
object
of
which
between
ourselves
is
none
too
clear
to
me
i
should
be
much
obliged
if
you
would
tell
me
to
whom
i
have
the
honour
of
speaking
absolutely
unnecessary
replied
the
stranger
absolutely
essential
declared
lupin
why
for
reasons
of
politeness
sir
you
know
my
name
and
i
do
not
know
yours
this
implies
a
disregard
of
good
form
which
i
can
not
suffer
the
stranger
lost
patience
the
mere
fact
that
the
governor
of
the
prison
brought
us
here
shows
that
borély
does
not
know
his
manners
said
lupin
borély
should
have
introduced
us
to
each
other
we
are
equals
here
sir
it
is
no
case
of
a
superior
and
an
inferior
of
a
prisoner
and
a
visitor
who
condescends
to
come
and
see
him
there
are
two
men
here
and
one
of
those
two
men
has
a
hat
on
his
head
which
he
ought
not
to
have
now
look
here
take
the
lesson
as
you
please
sir
said
lupin
the
stranger
came
closer
to
him
and
tried
to
speak
the
hat
first
said
lupin
the
hat
you
shall
listen
to
me
no
yes
no
matters
were
becoming
virulent
stupidly
the
second
stranger
the
one
who
had
kept
silent
placed
his
hand
on
his
companion
shoulder
and
said
in
german
leave
him
to
me
why
it
was
understood
hush
and
go
away
leaving
you
alone
yes
but
the
door
shut
it
and
walk
away
but
this
man
you
know
who
he
is
arsène
lupin
go
away
the
other
went
out
cursing
under
his
breath
pull
the
door
cried
the
second
visitor
harder
than
that
altogether
that
right
then
he
turned
took
the
lantern
and
raised
it
slowly
shall
i
tell
you
who
i
am
he
asked
no
replied
lupin
and
why
because
i
know
ah
you
are
the
visitor
i
was
expecting
i
yes
sire
chapter
xi
charlemagne
silence
said
the
stranger
sharply
do
use
that
word
then
what
shall
i
call
your
call
me
nothing
they
were
both
silent
and
this
moment
of
respite
was
not
one
of
those
which
go
before
the
struggle
of
two
adversaries
ready
for
the
fray
the
stranger
strode
to
and
fro
with
the
air
of
a
master
accustomed
to
command
and
to
be
obeyed
lupin
stood
motionless
he
had
abandoned
his
usual
provocative
attitude
and
his
sarcastic
smile
he
waited
gravely
and
deferentially
but
down
in
the
depths
of
his
being
he
revelled
eagerly
madly
in
the
marvellous
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
placed
here
in
his
cell
he
a
prisoner
he
the
adventurer
he
the
swindler
the
burglar
he
arsène
lupin
face
to
face
with
that
of
the
modern
world
that
formidable
entity
the
heir
of
cæsar
and
of
charlemagne
he
was
intoxicated
for
a
moment
with
the
sense
of
his
own
power
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
when
he
thought
of
his
triumph
the
stranger
stood
still
and
at
once
with
the
very
first
sentence
they
came
to
the
immediate
point
is
the
of
august
the
letters
are
to
be
published
are
they
not
in
two
hours
from
now
my
friends
are
to
hand
in
to
the
not
the
letters
themselves
but
an
exact
list
of
the
letters
with
the
hermann
annotations
that
list
shall
not
be
handed
in
it
shall
not
be
you
will
give
it
to
me
it
shall
be
placed
in
the
hands
of
your
in
your
hands
likewise
all
the
letters
likewise
all
the
letters
without
any
of
them
being
photographed
without
any
of
them
being
photographed
the
stranger
spoke
in
a
very
calm
voice
containing
not
the
least
accent
of
entreaty
nor
the
least
inflection
of
authority
he
neither
ordered
nor
requested
he
stated
the
inevitable
actions
of
arsène
lupin
things
would
happen
as
he
said
and
they
would
happen
whatever
arsène
demands
should
be
at
whatever
price
he
might
value
the
performance
of
those
actions
the
conditions
were
accepted
beforehand
by
jove
said
lupin
to
himself
that
jolly
clever
of
him
if
he
leaves
it
to
my
generosity
i
am
a
ruined
man
the
very
way
in
which
the
conversation
opened
the
frankness
of
the
words
employed
the
charm
of
voice
and
manner
all
pleased
him
infinitely
he
pulled
himself
together
lest
he
should
relent
and
abandon
all
the
advantages
which
he
had
conquered
so
fiercely
and
the
stranger
continued
have
you
read
the
letters
no
but
some
one
you
know
has
read
them
no
in
that
case
i
have
the
list
and
his
notes
moreover
i
know
the
where
he
put
all
his
papers
why
did
you
not
take
them
before
this
i
did
not
know
the
secret
of
the
until
i
came
here
my
friends
are
on
the
way
there
now
the
castle
is
guarded
it
is
occupied
by
two
hundred
of
my
most
trusty
men
ten
thousand
would
not
be
sufficient
after
a
minute
reflection
the
visitor
asked
how
do
you
know
the
secret
i
guessed
it
but
you
had
other
elements
of
information
which
the
papers
did
not
publish
no
none
at
all
and
yet
i
had
the
castle
searched
for
four
days
holmlock
shears
looked
in
the
wrong
place
ah
said
the
stranger
to
himself
it
an
odd
thing
an
odd
thing
and
to
lupin
you
are
sure
that
your
supposition
is
correct
it
is
not
a
supposition
it
is
a
certainty
so
much
the
better
muttered
the
visitor
there
will
be
no
rest
until
those
papers
cease
to
exist
and
placing
himself
in
front
of
arsène
lupin
how
much
what
said
lupin
taken
aback
how
much
for
the
papers
how
much
do
you
ask
to
reveal
the
secret
he
waited
for
lupin
to
name
a
figure
he
suggested
one
himself
fifty
thousand
a
hundred
thousand
and
when
lupin
did
not
reply
he
said
with
a
little
hesitation
more
two
hundred
thousand
very
well
i
agree
lupin
smiled
and
in
a
low
voice
said
it
is
a
handsome
figure
but
is
it
not
likely
that
some
sovereign
let
us
say
the
king
of
england
would
give
as
much
as
a
million
in
all
sincerity
i
believe
so
and
that
those
letters
are
priceless
to
the
emperor
that
they
are
worth
two
million
quite
as
easily
as
two
hundred
thousand
francs
three
million
as
easily
as
two
i
think
so
and
if
necessary
the
emperor
would
give
that
three
million
francs
yes
then
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
come
to
an
arrangement
on
that
basis
cried
the
stranger
not
without
some
alarm
lupin
smiled
again
on
that
basis
no
i
am
not
looking
for
money
i
want
something
else
something
that
is
worth
more
to
me
than
any
number
of
millions
what
is
that
my
liberty
what
your
liberty
but
i
can
do
nothing
that
concerns
your
country
the
law
i
have
no
power
lupin
went
up
to
him
and
lowering
his
voice
still
more
you
have
every
power
sire
my
liberty
is
not
such
an
exceptional
event
that
they
are
likely
to
refuse
you
then
i
should
have
to
ask
for
it
yes
of
whom
of
valenglay
the
prime
minister
but
valenglay
himself
can
do
no
more
than
i
he
can
open
the
doors
of
this
prison
for
me
it
would
cause
a
public
outcry
when
i
say
open
would
be
enough
we
should
counterfeit
an
escape
the
public
so
thoroughly
expects
it
that
it
would
not
so
much
as
ask
for
an
explanation
very
well
but
valenglay
will
never
consent
he
will
consent
why
because
you
will
express
the
wish
my
wishes
are
not
commands
to
him
no
but
an
opportunity
of
making
himself
agreeable
to
the
emperor
by
fulfilling
them
and
valenglay
is
too
shrewd
a
politician
nonsense
do
you
imagine
that
the
french
government
will
commit
so
illegal
an
act
for
the
sole
pleasure
of
making
itself
agreeable
to
me
that
pleasure
will
not
be
the
sole
one
what
will
be
the
other
the
pleasure
of
serving
france
by
accepting
the
proposal
which
will
accompany
the
request
for
my
release
i
am
to
make
a
proposal
i
yes
sire
what
proposal
i
do
not
know
but
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
always
a
favorable
ground
on
which
to
come
to
an
understanding
there
are
possibilities
of
agreement
the
stranger
looked
at
him
without
grasping
his
meaning
lupin
leant
forward
and
as
though
seeking
his
words
as
though
putting
an
imaginary
case
said
let
me
suppose
that
two
great
countries
are
divided
by
some
insignificant
question
that
they
have
different
points
of
view
on
a
matter
of
secondary
importance
a
colonial
matter
for
instance
in
which
their
is
at
stake
rather
than
their
interest
is
it
inconceivable
that
the
ruler
of
one
of
those
countries
might
come
of
his
own
accord
to
treat
this
matter
in
a
new
spirit
of
conciliation
and
give
the
necessary
instructions
so
that
so
that
i
might
leave
morocco
to
france
said
the
stranger
with
a
burst
of
laughter
the
idea
which
lupin
was
suggesting
struck
him
as
the
most
comical
thing
that
he
had
ever
heard
and
he
laughed
heartily
the
disparity
was
so
great
between
the
object
aimed
at
and
the
means
proposed
of
course
of
course
he
resumed
with
a
vain
attempt
to
recover
his
seriousness
of
course
it
a
very
original
idea
the
whole
of
modern
politics
upset
so
that
arsène
lupin
may
be
free
the
plans
of
the
empire
destroyed
so
that
arsène
lupin
may
continue
his
exploits
why
not
ask
me
for
alsace
and
lorraine
at
once
i
did
think
of
it
sire
replied
lupin
calmly
the
merriment
increased
splendid
and
you
let
me
off
this
time
yes
lupin
had
crossed
his
arms
he
too
was
amusing
himself
by
exaggerating
the
part
which
he
was
playing
and
he
continued
with
affected
seriousness
a
series
of
circumstances
might
one
day
arise
which
would
put
in
my
hands
the
power
of
and
that
restitution
when
that
day
comes
i
shall
certainly
not
fail
to
do
so
for
the
moment
the
weapons
at
my
disposal
oblige
me
to
be
more
modest
peace
in
morocco
will
satisfy
me
just
that
just
that
morocco
against
your
liberty
nothing
more
or
rather
for
we
must
not
lose
sight
entirely
of
the
main
object
of
this
conversation
or
rather
a
little
good
will
on
the
part
of
one
of
the
countries
in
question
and
in
exchange
the
surrender
of
the
letters
which
are
in
my
power
those
letters
those
letters
muttered
the
stranger
irritably
after
all
perhaps
they
are
not
so
valuable
there
are
some
in
your
own
hand
sire
and
you
considered
them
valuable
enough
to
come
to
this
cell
well
what
does
it
matter
but
there
are
others
of
which
you
do
not
know
the
authorship
and
about
which
i
can
give
you
a
few
particulars
oh
indeed
said
the
stranger
rather
anxiously
lupin
hesitated
speak
speak
plainly
said
the
stranger
say
what
you
have
in
your
mind
in
the
profound
silence
of
the
cell
lupin
declared
with
a
certain
solemnity
twenty
years
ago
a
draft
treaty
was
prepared
between
germany
great
britain
and
france
that
not
true
it
impossible
who
could
have
done
such
a
thing
the
emperor
father
and
the
queen
of
england
his
grandmother
both
acting
under
the
influence
of
the
empress
frederick
impossible
i
repeat
it
is
impossible
the
correspondence
is
in
the
at
veldenz
castle
and
i
alone
know
the
secret
of
the
the
stranger
walked
up
and
down
with
an
agitated
step
then
he
stopped
short
is
the
text
of
the
treaty
included
in
that
correspondence
yes
sire
it
is
in
your
father
own
hand
and
what
does
it
say
by
that
treaty
france
and
great
britain
granted
and
promised
germany
an
immense
colonial
empire
the
empire
which
she
does
not
at
present
possess
and
which
has
become
a
necessity
to
her
in
these
times
to
ensure
her
greatness
and
what
did
england
demand
as
a
against
that
empire
the
limitation
of
the
german
fleet
and
france
alsace
and
lorraine
the
emperor
leant
against
the
table
in
silent
thought
lupin
continued
everything
was
ready
the
cabinets
of
paris
and
london
had
been
sounded
and
had
consented
the
thing
was
practically
done
the
great
treaty
of
alliance
was
on
the
point
of
being
concluded
it
would
have
laid
the
foundations
of
a
definite
and
universal
peace
the
death
of
your
father
destroyed
that
sublime
dream
but
i
ask
your
imperial
majesty
what
will
your
people
think
what
will
the
world
think
when
it
knows
that
frederick
one
of
the
heroes
of
a
german
a
pure
and
loyal
german
respected
by
all
generally
admired
for
his
nobility
of
character
agreed
to
the
restitution
of
and
therefore
considered
that
restitution
just
he
was
silent
for
an
instant
leaving
the
problem
to
fix
itself
in
its
precise
terms
before
the
emperor
conscience
before
his
conscience
as
a
man
a
son
and
a
sovereign
then
he
concluded
your
imperial
majesty
yourself
must
know
whether
you
wish
or
do
not
wish
history
to
record
the
existence
of
that
treaty
as
for
me
sire
you
can
see
that
my
humble
personality
counts
for
very
little
in
the
discussion
a
long
pause
followed
upon
lupin
words
he
waited
with
his
soul
torn
with
anguish
his
whole
destiny
was
at
stake
in
this
minute
which
he
had
conceived
and
in
a
manner
produced
with
such
effort
and
such
stubbornness
an
historic
minute
born
of
his
brain
in
which
his
humble
personality
for
all
that
he
might
say
weighed
heavily
upon
the
fate
of
empires
and
the
peace
of
the
world
opposite
him
in
the
shadow
cæsar
stood
meditating
what
answer
would
he
make
what
solution
would
he
give
to
the
problem
he
walked
across
the
cell
for
a
few
moments
which
to
lupin
seemed
interminable
then
he
stopped
and
asked
are
there
any
other
conditions
yes
sire
but
they
are
insignificant
name
them
i
have
found
the
son
of
the
of
the
must
be
restored
to
him
anything
else
he
loves
a
young
girl
who
loves
him
in
her
turn
she
is
the
fairest
and
the
most
virtuous
of
her
sex
he
must
marry
her
anything
else
that
is
all
there
is
nothing
more
nothing
your
majesty
need
only
have
this
letter
delivered
to
the
editor
of
the
who
will
then
destroy
unread
the
article
which
he
may
now
receive
at
any
moment
lupin
held
out
the
letter
with
a
heavy
heart
and
a
trembling
hand
if
the
emperor
took
it
that
would
be
a
sign
of
his
acceptance
the
emperor
hesitated
and
then
with
an
abrupt
movement
took
the
letter
put
on
his
hat
wrapped
his
cloak
round
him
and
walked
out
without
a
word
lupin
remained
for
a
few
seconds
staggering
as
though
dazed
then
suddenly
he
fell
into
his
chair
shouting
with
joy
and
pride
monsieur
le
juge
i
am
sorry
to
say
to
you
why
lupin
are
you
thinking
of
leaving
us
with
the
greatest
reluctance
i
assure
you
monsieur
le
juge
our
relations
have
been
so
very
pleasant
and
cordial
but
all
good
things
must
come
to
an
end
my
cure
at
the
santé
palace
is
finished
other
duties
call
me
i
have
resolved
to
make
my
escape
then
i
wish
you
good
luck
m
lupin
a
thousand
thanks
le
juge
arsène
lupin
waited
patiently
for
the
hour
of
his
escape
not
without
asking
himself
how
it
would
be
contrived
and
by
what
means
france
and
germany
uniting
for
the
joint
performance
of
this
deserving
work
would
succeed
in
effecting
it
without
creating
too
great
a
scandal
late
in
the
afternoon
the
warder
told
him
to
go
to
the
he
hurried
out
and
was
met
by
the
governor
who
handed
him
over
to
weber
weber
made
him
step
into
a
in
which
somebody
was
already
seated
lupin
had
a
violent
fit
of
laughter
what
you
my
poor
old
weber
have
they
let
you
in
for
this
tiresome
job
are
you
to
be
responsible
for
my
escape
upon
my
word
you
are
an
unlucky
beggar
oh
my
poor
old
chap
what
hard
lines
first
made
famous
through
my
arrest
you
are
now
to
become
immortal
through
my
escape
he
looked
at
the
other
man
well
well
monsieur
le
préfet
de
police
so
you
are
in
the
business
too
that
a
nasty
thing
for
you
what
if
you
take
my
advice
stay
in
the
background
and
leave
the
honor
and
glory
to
weber
it
his
by
right
and
he
can
stand
a
lot
the
rascal
the
car
travelled
at
a
fast
pace
along
the
seine
and
through
boulogne
at
they
crossed
the
river
splendid
cried
lupin
we
going
to
garches
you
want
me
there
in
order
to
reënact
the
death
of
altenheim
we
shall
go
down
into
the
underground
passage
i
shall
disappear
and
people
will
say
that
i
got
through
another
outlet
known
to
myself
alone
lord
how
idiotic
he
seemed
quite
unhappy
about
it
idiotic
idiotic
in
the
highest
degree
i
blush
for
shame
and
those
are
the
people
who
govern
us
what
an
age
to
live
in
but
you
poor
devils
why
did
you
come
to
me
i
have
invented
a
beautiful
little
escape
for
you
something
of
a
miraculous
nature
i
had
it
all
ready
in
my
mind
the
public
would
have
yelled
with
wonder
and
danced
with
delight
instead
of
which
however
quite
true
that
you
were
given
rather
short
notice
but
all
the
same
the
programme
was
exactly
as
lupin
had
foreseen
they
walked
through
the
grounds
of
the
house
of
retreat
to
the
pavillon
hortense
lupin
and
his
two
companions
went
down
the
stairs
and
along
the
underground
passage
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
the
said
you
are
free
and
there
you
are
said
lupin
is
that
all
well
my
dear
weber
thank
you
very
much
and
sorry
to
have
given
you
so
much
trouble
monsieur
le
préfet
kind
regards
to
the
missus
he
climbed
the
stairs
that
led
to
the
villa
des
glycines
raised
the
and
sprang
into
the
room
a
hand
fell
on
his
shoulder
opposite
him
stood
his
first
visitor
of
the
day
before
the
one
who
had
accompanied
the
emperor
there
were
four
men
with
him
two
on
either
side
look
here
said
lupin
what
the
meaning
of
this
joke
i
thought
i
was
free
yes
yes
growled
the
german
in
his
rough
voice
you
are
free
free
to
travel
with
the
five
of
us
if
that
suits
you
lupin
looked
at
him
for
a
second
with
a
mad
longing
to
hit
him
on
the
nose
just
to
teach
him
but
the
five
men
looked
devilish
determined
their
leader
did
not
betray
any
exaggerated
fondness
for
him
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
fellow
would
be
only
too
pleased
to
resort
to
extreme
measures
besides
after
all
what
did
he
care
he
chuckled
if
it
suits
me
why
it
the
dream
of
my
life
a
powerful
covered
car
was
waiting
in
the
paved
yard
outside
the
villa
two
men
got
into
the
driver
seat
two
others
inside
with
their
backs
to
the
motor
lupin
and
the
stranger
sat
down
on
the
front
seat
cried
lupin
in
german
nach
veldenz
the
stranger
said
silence
those
men
must
know
nothing
speak
french
they
do
know
french
but
why
speak
at
all
quite
right
said
lupin
to
himself
why
speak
at
all
the
car
travelled
all
the
evening
and
all
night
without
any
incident
twice
they
stopped
to
take
in
petrol
at
some
sleepy
little
town
the
germans
took
it
in
turns
to
watch
their
prisoner
who
did
not
open
his
eyes
until
the
early
morning
they
stopped
for
breakfast
at
an
inn
on
a
hillside
near
which
stood
a
lupin
saw
that
they
were
at
an
equal
distance
from
metz
and
luxemburg
from
there
they
took
a
road
that
slanted
in
the
direction
of
treves
lupin
said
to
his
am
i
right
in
believing
that
i
have
the
honor
of
speaking
to
count
von
waldemar
the
emperor
confidential
friend
the
one
who
searched
hermann
iii
house
in
dresden
the
stranger
remained
silent
you
the
sort
of
chap
i
ca
stand
at
any
price
muttered
lupin
i
have
some
fun
with
you
one
of
these
days
you
ugly
fat
you
heavy
in
short
i
do
like
you
and
he
added
aloud
you
are
wrong
not
to
answer
me
monsieur
le
comte
i
was
speaking
in
your
own
interest
just
as
we
were
stepping
in
i
saw
a
motor
come
into
sight
behind
us
on
the
horizon
did
you
see
it
no
why
nothing
still
no
nothing
at
all
a
mere
remark
besides
we
are
ten
minutes
ahead
and
our
car
is
at
least
a
it
a
sixty
said
the
german
looking
at
him
uneasily
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
oh
then
we
all
right
they
were
climbing
a
little
slope
when
they
reached
the
top
the
count
leant
out
of
the
window
damn
it
all
he
swore
what
the
matter
asked
lupin
the
count
turned
to
him
and
in
a
threatening
voice
take
care
if
anything
happens
it
will
be
so
much
the
worse
for
you
oho
it
seems
the
other
gaining
on
us
but
what
are
you
afraid
of
my
dear
count
it
no
doubt
a
traveller
perhaps
even
some
one
they
are
sending
to
help
us
i
do
want
any
help
growled
the
german
he
leant
out
again
the
car
was
only
two
or
three
hundred
yards
behind
he
said
to
his
men
pointing
to
lupin
bind
him
if
he
resists
he
drew
his
revolver
why
should
i
resist
o
gentle
teuton
chuckled
lupin
and
he
added
while
they
were
fastening
his
hands
it
is
really
curious
to
see
how
people
take
precautions
when
they
need
not
and
do
when
they
ought
to
what
the
devil
do
you
care
about
that
motor
accomplices
of
mine
what
an
idea
without
replying
the
german
gave
orders
to
the
driver
to
the
right
slow
down
let
them
pass
if
they
slow
down
also
stop
but
to
his
great
surprise
the
motor
seemed
on
the
contrary
to
increase
its
speed
it
passed
in
front
of
the
car
like
a
whirlwind
in
a
cloud
of
dust
standing
up
at
the
back
leaning
over
the
hood
which
was
lowered
was
a
man
dressed
in
black
he
raised
his
arm
two
shots
rang
out
the
count
who
was
blocking
the
whole
of
the
left
window
fell
back
into
the
car
before
even
attending
to
him
the
two
men
leapt
upon
lupin
and
finished
securing
him
jackasses
blockheads
shouted
lupin
shaking
with
rage
let
me
go
on
the
contrary
there
now
we
stopping
but
go
after
him
you
silly
fools
catch
him
up
it
the
man
in
black
i
tell
you
the
murderer
oh
the
idiots
they
gagged
him
then
they
attended
to
the
count
the
wound
did
not
appear
to
be
serious
and
was
soon
dressed
but
the
patient
who
was
in
a
very
excited
state
had
an
attack
of
fever
and
became
delirious
it
was
eight
in
the
morning
they
were
in
the
open
country
far
from
any
village
the
men
had
no
information
as
to
the
exact
object
of
the
journey
where
were
they
to
go
whom
were
they
to
send
to
they
drew
up
the
motor
beside
a
wood
and
waited
the
whole
day
went
by
in
this
way
it
was
evening
before
a
squad
of
cavalry
arrived
dispatched
from
treves
in
search
of
the
two
hours
later
lupin
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
still
escorted
by
his
two
germans
by
the
light
of
a
lantern
climbed
the
steps
of
a
staircase
that
led
to
a
small
room
with
windows
here
he
spent
the
night
the
next
morning
an
officer
led
him
through
a
courtyard
filled
with
soldiers
to
the
centre
of
a
long
row
of
buildings
that
ran
round
the
foot
of
a
mound
covered
with
monumental
ruins
he
was
shown
into
a
large
room
his
visitor
of
two
days
back
was
sitting
at
a
reading
newspapers
and
reports
which
he
marked
with
great
strokes
of
red
pencil
leave
us
he
said
to
the
officer
and
going
up
to
lupin
the
papers
the
tone
was
no
longer
the
same
it
was
now
the
harsh
and
imperious
tone
of
the
master
who
is
at
home
and
addressing
an
inferior
and
such
an
inferior
a
rogue
an
adventurer
of
the
worst
type
before
whom
he
had
been
obliged
to
humiliate
himself
the
papers
he
repeated
lupin
was
not
put
out
of
countenance
he
said
quite
calmly
they
are
in
veldenz
castle
we
are
in
the
of
the
castle
those
are
the
ruins
of
veldenz
over
there
the
papers
are
in
the
ruins
let
us
go
to
them
show
me
the
way
lupin
did
not
budge
well
well
sire
it
is
not
as
simple
as
you
think
it
takes
some
time
to
bring
into
play
the
elements
which
are
needed
to
open
that
how
long
do
you
want
hours
an
angry
movement
quickly
suppressed
oh
there
was
no
question
of
that
between
us
nothing
was
specified
neither
that
nor
the
little
trip
which
your
imperial
majesty
made
me
take
in
the
charge
of
half
a
dozen
of
your
i
am
to
hand
over
the
papers
that
is
all
and
i
am
not
to
give
you
your
liberty
until
you
do
hand
over
those
papers
it
is
a
question
of
confidence
sire
i
should
have
considered
myself
quite
as
much
bound
to
produce
the
papers
if
i
had
been
free
on
leaving
prison
and
your
imperial
majesty
may
be
sure
that
i
should
not
have
walked
off
with
them
the
only
difference
is
that
they
would
now
be
in
your
possession
for
we
have
lost
a
day
sire
and
a
day
in
this
business
is
a
day
too
much
only
there
it
is
you
should
have
had
confidence
the
emperor
gazed
with
a
certain
amazement
at
that
outcast
that
vagabond
who
seemed
vexed
that
any
one
should
doubt
his
word
he
did
not
reply
but
rang
the
bell
the
officer
on
duty
he
commanded
count
von
waldemar
appeared
looking
very
white
ah
it
you
waldemar
so
you
all
right
again
at
your
service
sire
take
five
men
with
you
the
same
men
as
you
sure
of
them
do
leave
this
gentleman
until
morning
he
looked
at
his
watch
until
morning
at
ten
no
i
will
give
him
till
twelve
you
will
go
wherever
he
thinks
fit
to
go
you
will
do
whatever
he
tells
you
to
do
in
short
you
are
at
his
disposal
at
twelve
i
will
join
you
if
at
the
last
stroke
of
twelve
he
has
not
handed
me
the
bundle
of
letters
you
will
put
him
back
in
your
car
and
without
losing
a
second
take
him
straight
to
the
santé
prison
if
he
tries
to
escape
take
your
own
course
he
went
out
lupin
helped
himself
to
a
cigar
from
the
table
and
threw
himself
into
an
easy
chair
good
i
just
love
that
way
of
going
to
work
it
is
frank
and
explicit
the
count
had
brought
in
his
men
he
said
to
lupin
march
lupin
lit
his
cigar
and
did
not
move
bind
his
hands
said
the
count
and
when
the
order
was
executed
he
repeated
now
then
march
no
what
do
you
mean
by
no
i
wondering
what
about
where
on
earth
that
can
be
the
count
gave
a
start
and
lupin
chuckled
for
the
best
part
of
the
story
is
that
i
have
not
the
remotest
idea
where
that
famous
is
nor
how
to
set
about
discovering
it
what
do
you
say
to
that
my
dear
waldemar
eh
funny
is
it
not
the
very
remotest
idea
chapter
xii
the
emperor
letters
the
ruins
of
veldenz
are
well
known
to
all
who
visit
the
banks
of
the
rhine
and
the
moselle
they
comprise
the
remains
of
the
old
feudal
castle
built
in
by
the
archbishop
of
fistingen
an
enormous
gutted
by
turenne
troops
and
the
walls
left
standing
in
their
entirety
of
a
large
renascence
palace
in
which
the
of
zweibrucken
lived
for
three
centuries
it
was
this
palace
that
was
sacked
by
hermann
ii
rebellious
subjects
the
empty
windows
display
two
hundred
yawning
cavities
on
the
four
frontages
all
the
wainscoting
the
hangings
and
most
of
the
furniture
were
burnt
you
walk
on
the
scorched
girders
of
the
floors
and
the
sky
can
be
seen
at
intervals
through
the
ruined
ceilings
lupin
accompanied
by
his
escort
went
over
the
whole
building
in
two
hours
time
i
am
very
pleased
with
you
my
dear
count
i
do
think
i
ever
came
across
a
guide
so
well
posted
in
his
subject
nor
which
is
rare
so
silent
and
now
if
you
do
mind
we
will
go
to
lunch
as
a
matter
of
fact
lupin
knew
no
more
than
at
the
first
moment
and
his
perplexity
did
nothing
but
increase
to
obtain
his
release
from
prison
and
to
strike
the
imagination
of
his
visitor
he
had
bluffed
pretending
to
know
everything
and
he
was
still
seeking
for
the
best
place
at
which
to
begin
to
seek
things
look
bad
he
said
to
himself
from
time
to
time
things
are
looking
about
as
bad
as
they
can
look
his
brain
moreover
was
not
as
clear
as
usual
he
was
obsessed
by
an
idea
the
idea
of
the
other
one
the
murderer
the
assassin
whom
he
knew
to
be
still
clinging
to
his
footsteps
how
did
that
mysterious
personality
come
to
be
on
his
tracks
how
had
he
heard
of
lupin
leaving
prison
and
of
his
rush
to
luxemburg
and
germany
was
it
a
miraculous
intuition
or
was
it
the
outcome
of
definite
information
but
if
so
at
what
price
by
means
of
what
promises
or
threats
was
he
able
to
obtain
it
all
these
questions
haunted
lupin
mind
at
about
four
however
after
a
fresh
walk
through
the
ruins
in
the
course
of
which
he
had
examined
the
stones
measured
the
thickness
of
the
walls
investigated
the
shape
and
appearance
of
things
all
to
no
purpose
he
asked
the
count
is
there
no
one
left
who
was
in
the
service
of
the
last
who
lived
in
the
castle
all
the
servants
of
that
time
went
different
ways
only
one
of
them
continued
to
live
in
the
district
well
he
died
two
years
ago
any
children
he
had
a
son
who
married
and
who
was
dismissed
with
his
wife
for
disgraceful
conduct
they
left
their
youngest
child
behind
a
little
girl
isilda
where
does
she
live
she
lives
here
at
the
end
of
these
buildings
the
old
grandfather
used
to
act
as
a
guide
to
visitors
in
the
days
when
the
castle
was
still
open
to
the
public
little
isilda
has
lived
in
the
ruins
ever
since
she
was
allowed
to
remain
out
of
pity
she
is
a
poor
innocent
who
is
hardly
able
to
talk
and
does
not
know
what
she
says
was
she
always
like
that
it
seems
not
her
reason
went
gradually
when
she
was
about
ten
years
old
in
consequence
of
a
sorrow
of
a
fright
no
for
no
direct
cause
i
am
told
the
father
was
a
drunkard
and
the
mother
committed
suicide
in
a
fit
of
madness
lupin
reflected
and
said
i
should
like
to
see
her
the
count
gave
a
rather
curious
smile
you
can
see
her
by
all
means
she
happened
to
be
in
one
of
the
rooms
which
had
been
set
apart
for
her
lupin
was
surprised
to
find
an
attractive
little
creature
too
thin
too
pale
but
almost
pretty
with
her
fair
hair
and
her
delicate
face
her
eyes
had
the
vague
dreamy
look
of
the
eyes
of
blind
people
he
put
a
few
questions
to
which
isilda
gave
no
answer
and
others
to
which
she
replied
with
incoherent
sentences
as
though
she
understood
neither
the
meaning
of
the
words
addressed
to
her
nor
those
which
she
herself
uttered
he
persisted
taking
her
very
gently
by
the
hand
and
asking
her
in
an
affectionate
tone
about
the
time
when
she
still
had
her
reason
about
her
grandfather
about
the
memories
which
might
be
called
up
by
her
life
as
a
child
playing
freely
among
the
majestic
ruins
of
the
castle
she
stood
silent
with
staring
eyes
impassive
any
emotion
which
she
might
have
felt
was
not
enough
to
rouse
her
slumbering
intelligence
lupin
asked
for
a
pencil
and
paper
and
wrote
down
the
number
the
count
smiled
again
look
here
what
are
you
laughing
at
cried
lupin
irritably
nothing
nothing
i
very
much
interested
that
all
isilda
looked
at
the
sheet
of
paper
when
he
showed
it
to
her
and
turned
away
her
head
with
a
vacant
air
no
bite
said
the
count
satirically
lupin
wrote
the
letters
apoon
isilda
paid
no
more
attention
than
before
he
did
not
give
up
the
experiment
but
kept
on
writing
the
same
letters
each
time
watching
the
girl
face
she
did
not
stir
but
kept
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
paper
with
an
indifference
which
nothing
seemed
to
disturb
then
all
at
once
she
seized
the
pencil
snatched
the
last
sheet
out
of
lupin
hands
and
as
though
acting
under
a
sudden
inspiration
wrote
two
l
in
the
middle
of
a
space
left
open
by
lupin
he
felt
a
thrill
a
word
had
been
formed
apollon
meanwhile
isilda
clung
to
both
pencil
and
paper
and
with
clutching
fingers
and
a
strained
face
was
struggling
to
make
her
hand
submit
to
the
hesitating
orders
of
her
poor
little
brain
lupin
waited
feverishly
she
rapidly
wrote
another
word
the
word
diane
another
word
another
word
shouted
lupin
she
twisted
her
fingers
round
the
pencil
broke
the
lead
made
a
big
j
with
the
stump
and
now
utterly
exhausted
dropped
the
pencil
another
word
i
must
have
another
word
said
lupin
in
a
tone
of
command
catching
her
by
the
arm
but
he
saw
by
her
eyes
which
had
once
more
become
indifferent
that
that
fleeting
gleam
of
intelligence
could
not
shine
out
again
let
us
go
he
said
he
was
walking
away
when
she
ran
after
him
and
stood
in
his
path
he
stopped
what
is
it
she
held
out
the
palm
of
her
hand
what
money
is
she
in
the
habit
of
begging
he
asked
the
count
no
said
waldemar
and
i
ca
understand
isilda
took
two
gold
coins
from
her
pocket
and
chinked
them
together
gleefully
lupin
looked
at
them
they
were
french
coins
quite
new
bearing
the
date
of
that
year
where
did
you
get
these
asked
lupin
excitedly
french
money
who
gave
it
you
and
when
was
it
speak
answer
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
fool
that
i
am
as
though
she
could
answer
my
dear
count
would
you
mind
lending
me
forty
marks
thanks
here
isilda
that
for
you
she
took
the
two
coins
jingled
them
with
the
others
in
the
palm
of
her
hand
and
then
putting
out
her
arm
pointed
to
the
ruins
of
the
renascence
palace
with
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
call
attention
more
particularly
to
the
left
wing
and
to
the
top
of
that
wing
was
it
a
mechanical
movement
or
must
it
be
looked
upon
as
a
grateful
acknowledgment
for
the
two
gold
coins
he
glanced
at
the
count
waldemar
was
smiling
again
what
makes
the
brute
keep
on
grinning
like
that
said
lupin
to
himself
any
one
would
think
that
he
was
having
a
game
with
me
he
went
to
the
palace
on
the
attended
by
his
escort
the
consisted
of
a
number
of
large
running
one
into
the
other
and
containing
the
few
pieces
of
furniture
that
had
escaped
the
fire
on
the
first
floor
on
the
north
side
was
a
long
gallery
out
of
which
twelve
handsome
rooms
opened
all
exactly
alike
there
was
a
similar
gallery
on
the
second
floor
but
with
smaller
rooms
also
resembling
one
another
all
these
apartments
were
empty
dilapidated
wretched
to
look
at
above
there
was
nothing
the
attics
had
been
burnt
down
for
an
hour
lupin
walked
ran
rushed
about
indefatigably
with
his
eyes
on
the
when
it
began
to
grow
dusk
he
hurried
to
one
of
his
twelve
rooms
on
the
first
floor
as
if
he
were
selecting
it
for
special
reasons
known
to
himself
alone
he
was
rather
surprised
to
find
the
emperor
there
smoking
and
seated
in
an
which
he
had
sent
for
taking
no
notice
of
his
presence
lupin
began
an
inspection
of
the
room
according
to
the
methods
which
he
was
accustomed
to
employ
in
such
cases
dividing
the
room
into
sections
each
of
which
he
examined
in
turn
after
twenty
minutes
of
this
work
he
said
i
must
beg
you
sire
to
be
good
enough
to
move
there
is
a
fireplace
here
the
emperor
tossed
his
head
is
it
really
necessary
for
me
to
move
yes
sire
this
fireplace
the
fireplace
is
just
the
same
as
the
others
and
the
room
is
no
different
from
its
fellows
lupin
looked
at
the
emperor
without
understanding
the
emperor
rose
and
said
with
a
laugh
i
think
lupin
that
you
have
been
making
just
a
little
fun
of
me
how
do
you
mean
sire
oh
it
hardly
worth
mentioning
you
obtained
your
release
on
the
condition
of
handing
me
certain
papers
in
which
i
am
interested
and
you
have
not
the
smallest
notion
as
to
where
they
are
i
have
been
thoroughly
what
do
you
call
it
in
french
do
you
think
so
sire
why
what
a
man
knows
he
does
have
to
hunt
for
and
you
have
been
hunting
for
ten
good
hours
does
it
strike
you
as
a
case
for
an
immediate
return
to
prison
lupin
seemed
thunderstruck
did
not
your
imperial
majesty
fix
twelve
as
the
last
limit
why
wait
why
well
to
allow
me
to
complete
my
work
your
work
but
it
not
even
begun
m
lupin
there
your
imperial
majesty
is
mistaken
prove
it
and
i
will
wait
until
lupin
reflected
and
speaking
in
a
serious
tone
since
your
imperial
majesty
requires
proofs
in
order
to
have
confidence
in
me
i
will
furnish
them
the
twelve
rooms
leading
out
of
this
gallery
each
bear
a
different
name
which
is
inscribed
in
french
obviously
by
a
french
decorative
artist
over
the
various
doors
one
of
the
inscriptions
less
damaged
by
the
fire
than
the
others
caught
my
eye
as
i
was
passing
along
the
gallery
i
examined
the
other
doors
all
of
them
bore
hardly
legible
traces
of
names
caned
over
the
pediments
thus
i
found
a
and
an
the
first
and
last
letters
of
i
found
an
and
which
pointed
to
these
are
the
french
equivalents
of
diana
and
apollo
both
of
them
mythological
deities
the
other
inscriptions
presented
similar
characteristics
i
discovered
traces
of
such
names
as
jupiter
venus
mercury
saturn
and
so
on
this
part
of
the
problem
was
solved
each
of
the
twelve
rooms
bears
the
name
of
an
olympian
god
or
goddess
and
the
letters
apoon
completed
by
isilda
point
to
the
apollo
room
or
salle
so
it
is
here
in
the
room
in
which
we
now
are
that
the
letters
are
hidden
a
few
minutes
perhaps
will
suffice
in
which
to
discover
them
a
few
minutes
or
a
few
years
or
even
longer
said
the
emperor
laughing
he
seemed
greatly
amused
and
the
count
also
displayed
a
coarse
merriment
lupin
asked
would
your
imperial
majesty
be
good
enough
to
explain
lupin
the
exciting
investigation
which
you
have
conducted
and
of
which
you
are
telling
us
the
brilliant
results
has
already
been
made
by
me
yes
a
fortnight
ago
in
the
company
of
your
friend
holmlock
shears
together
we
questioned
little
isilda
together
we
employed
the
same
method
in
dealing
with
her
that
you
did
and
together
we
observed
the
names
in
the
gallery
and
got
as
far
as
this
room
the
apollo
room
lupin
turned
livid
he
spluttered
oh
did
shears
get
as
far
as
this
yes
after
four
days
searching
true
it
did
not
help
us
for
we
found
nothing
all
the
same
i
know
that
the
letters
are
not
here
trembling
with
rage
wounded
in
his
innermost
pride
lupin
fired
up
under
the
gibe
as
though
he
had
been
lashed
with
a
whip
he
had
never
felt
humiliated
to
such
a
degree
as
this
in
this
fury
he
could
have
strangled
the
fat
waldemar
whose
laughter
incensed
him
containing
himself
with
an
effort
he
said
it
took
shears
four
days
sire
and
me
only
four
hours
and
i
should
have
required
even
less
if
i
had
not
been
thwarted
in
my
search
and
by
whom
bless
my
soul
by
my
faithful
count
i
hope
he
did
not
dare
no
sire
but
by
the
most
terrible
and
powerful
of
my
enemies
by
that
infernal
being
who
killed
his
own
accomplice
altenheim
is
he
here
do
you
think
so
exclaimed
the
emperor
with
an
agitation
which
showed
that
he
was
familiar
with
every
detail
of
the
dramatic
story
he
is
wherever
i
am
he
threatens
me
with
his
constant
hatred
it
was
he
who
guessed
that
i
was
lenormand
the
chief
of
the
it
was
he
who
had
me
put
in
prison
it
was
he
again
who
pursued
me
on
the
day
when
i
came
out
yesterday
aiming
at
me
in
the
motor
he
wounded
count
von
waldemar
but
how
do
you
know
how
can
you
be
sure
that
he
is
at
veldenz
isilda
has
received
two
gold
coins
two
french
coins
and
what
is
he
here
for
with
what
object
i
do
know
sire
but
he
is
the
very
spirit
of
evil
your
imperial
majesty
must
be
on
your
guard
he
is
capable
of
anything
and
everything
it
is
impossible
i
have
two
hundred
men
in
the
ruins
he
can
not
have
entered
he
would
have
been
seen
some
one
has
seen
him
beyond
a
doubt
who
isilda
let
her
be
questioned
waldemar
take
your
prisoner
to
where
the
girl
is
lupin
showed
his
bound
hands
it
will
be
a
tough
battle
can
i
fight
like
this
the
emperor
said
to
the
count
unfasten
him
and
keep
me
informed
in
this
way
by
a
sudden
effort
bringing
the
hateful
vision
of
the
murder
into
the
discussion
boldly
without
evidence
arsène
lupin
gained
time
and
resumed
the
direction
of
the
search
sixteen
hours
still
he
said
to
himself
it
more
than
i
want
he
reached
the
premises
occupied
by
isilda
at
the
end
of
the
old
these
buildings
served
as
barracks
for
the
two
hundred
soldiers
guarding
the
ruins
and
the
whole
of
this
the
left
wing
was
reserved
for
the
officers
isilda
was
not
there
the
count
sent
two
of
his
men
to
look
for
her
they
came
back
no
one
had
seen
the
girl
nevertheless
she
could
not
have
left
the
precincts
of
the
ruins
as
for
the
renascence
palace
it
was
so
to
speak
invested
by
of
the
troops
and
no
one
was
able
to
obtain
admittance
at
last
the
wife
of
a
subaltern
who
lived
in
the
next
house
declared
that
she
had
been
sitting
at
her
window
all
day
and
that
the
girl
had
not
been
out
if
she
had
gone
out
said
waldemar
she
would
be
here
now
and
she
is
not
here
lupin
observed
is
there
a
floor
above
yes
but
from
this
room
to
the
upper
floor
there
is
no
staircase
yes
there
is
he
pointed
to
a
little
door
opening
on
a
dark
recess
in
the
shadow
he
saw
the
first
treads
of
a
staircase
as
steep
as
a
ladder
please
my
dear
count
he
said
to
waldemar
who
wanted
to
go
up
let
me
have
the
honor
why
there
danger
he
ran
up
and
at
once
sprang
into
a
low
and
narrow
loft
a
cry
escaped
him
oh
what
is
it
asked
the
count
emerging
in
his
turn
here
on
the
floor
isilda
he
knelt
down
beside
the
girl
but
at
the
first
glance
saw
that
she
was
simply
stunned
and
that
she
bore
no
trace
of
a
wound
except
a
few
scratches
on
the
wrists
and
hands
a
handkerchief
was
stuffed
into
her
mouth
by
way
of
a
gag
that
it
he
said
the
murderer
was
here
with
her
when
we
came
he
struck
her
a
blow
with
his
fist
and
gagged
her
so
that
we
should
not
hear
her
moans
but
how
did
he
get
away
through
here
look
there
is
a
passage
connecting
all
the
attics
on
the
first
floor
and
from
there
from
there
he
went
down
the
stairs
of
one
of
the
other
dwellings
but
he
would
have
been
seen
pooh
who
knows
the
creature
invisible
never
mind
send
your
men
to
look
tell
them
to
search
all
the
attics
and
all
the
lodgings
he
hesitated
should
he
also
go
in
pursuit
of
the
murderer
but
a
sound
brought
him
back
to
the
girl
side
she
had
got
up
from
the
floor
and
a
dozen
pieces
of
gold
money
had
dropped
from
her
hands
he
examined
them
they
were
all
french
ah
he
said
i
was
right
only
why
so
much
gold
in
reward
for
what
suddenly
he
caught
sight
of
a
book
on
the
floor
and
stooped
to
pick
it
up
but
the
girl
darted
forward
with
a
quicker
movement
seized
the
book
and
pressed
it
to
her
bosom
with
a
fierce
energy
as
though
prepared
to
defend
it
against
any
attempt
to
take
hold
of
it
that
it
he
said
the
money
was
offered
her
for
the
book
but
she
refused
to
part
with
it
hence
the
scratches
on
the
hands
the
interesting
thing
would
be
to
know
why
the
murderer
wished
to
possess
the
book
was
he
able
to
look
through
it
first
he
said
to
waldemar
my
dear
count
please
give
the
order
waldemar
made
a
sign
to
his
men
three
of
them
threw
themselves
on
the
girl
and
after
a
hard
tussle
in
which
the
poor
thing
stamped
writhed
and
screamed
with
rage
they
took
the
volume
from
her
gently
child
said
lupin
be
calm
it
all
in
a
good
cause
keep
an
eye
on
her
will
you
meanwhile
i
will
have
a
look
at
the
object
in
dispute
it
was
an
odd
volume
of
montesquieu
au
temple
de
in
a
binding
at
least
a
century
old
but
lupin
had
hardly
opened
it
before
he
exclaimed
i
say
i
say
this
is
queer
there
is
a
sheet
of
parchment
stuck
on
each
right
hand
page
and
those
sheets
are
covered
with
a
very
close
small
handwriting
he
read
at
the
beginning
of
the
chevalier
gilles
de
malrêche
french
servant
to
his
royal
highness
the
prince
of
zweibruckenveldenz
begun
in
the
year
of
our
lord
what
does
it
say
that
asked
the
count
what
surprises
you
isilda
grandfather
the
old
man
who
died
two
years
ago
was
called
malreich
which
is
the
german
form
of
the
same
name
capital
isilda
grandfather
must
have
been
the
son
or
the
grandson
of
the
french
servant
who
wrote
his
diary
in
an
odd
volume
of
works
and
that
is
how
the
diary
came
into
isilda
hands
he
turned
the
pages
at
random
september
his
royal
highness
went
hunting
september
his
royal
highness
went
out
riding
he
was
mounted
on
cupidon
by
jove
muttered
lupin
so
far
it
not
very
exciting
he
turned
over
a
number
of
pages
and
read
march
i
have
remitted
ten
crowns
to
hermann
he
is
giving
in
london
lupin
gave
a
laugh
oho
hermann
is
dethroned
and
our
respect
comes
down
with
a
rush
yes
observed
waldemar
the
reigning
was
driven
from
his
dominions
by
the
french
troops
lupin
continued
napoleon
slept
at
veldenz
last
night
i
made
his
majesty
bed
and
this
morning
i
emptied
his
slops
oh
did
napoleon
stop
at
veldenz
yes
yes
on
his
way
back
to
the
army
at
the
time
of
the
austrian
campaign
which
ended
with
the
battle
of
wagram
it
was
an
honor
of
which
the
family
were
very
proud
afterwards
lupin
went
on
reading
october
his
royal
highness
returned
to
his
dominions
october
i
accompanied
his
royal
highness
to
the
last
night
and
was
happy
to
be
able
to
show
him
that
no
one
had
guessed
its
existence
for
that
matter
who
would
have
suspected
that
a
could
be
contrived
in
lupin
stopped
with
a
shout
isilda
had
suddenly
escaped
from
the
men
guarding
her
made
a
grab
at
him
and
taken
to
flight
carrying
the
book
with
her
oh
the
little
mischief
quick
you
go
round
by
the
stairs
below
i
run
after
her
by
the
passage
but
she
had
slammed
the
door
behind
her
and
bolted
it
he
had
to
go
down
and
run
along
the
buildings
with
the
others
looking
for
a
staircase
which
would
take
them
to
the
first
floor
the
fourth
house
was
the
only
one
open
he
went
upstairs
but
the
passage
was
empty
and
he
had
to
knock
at
doors
force
locks
and
make
his
way
into
unoccupied
rooms
while
waldemar
showing
as
much
ardor
in
the
pursuit
as
himself
pricked
the
curtains
and
hangings
with
the
point
of
his
sword
a
voice
called
out
from
the
towards
the
right
wing
they
rushed
in
that
direction
it
was
one
of
the
officers
wives
who
beckoned
to
them
at
the
end
of
a
passage
and
told
them
that
the
girl
must
be
in
her
lodging
how
do
you
know
asked
lupin
i
wanted
to
go
to
my
room
the
door
was
shut
and
i
could
not
get
in
lupin
tried
and
found
the
door
locked
the
window
he
cried
there
must
be
a
window
he
went
outside
took
the
count
sword
and
smashed
the
panes
then
helped
up
by
two
men
he
hung
on
to
the
wall
passed
his
arm
through
the
broken
glass
turned
the
latch
and
stumbled
into
the
room
he
saw
isilda
huddled
before
the
fireplace
almost
in
the
midst
of
the
flames
the
little
beast
he
said
she
has
thrown
it
into
the
fire
he
pushed
her
back
savagely
tried
to
take
the
book
and
burnt
his
hands
in
the
attempt
then
with
the
tongs
he
pulled
it
out
of
the
grate
and
threw
the
table
cloth
over
it
to
stifle
the
blaze
but
it
was
too
late
the
pages
of
the
old
manuscript
all
burnt
up
were
falling
into
ashes
lupin
gazed
at
her
in
silence
the
count
said
one
would
think
that
she
knew
what
she
was
doing
no
she
does
not
know
only
her
grandfather
must
have
entrusted
her
with
that
book
as
a
sort
of
treasure
a
treasure
which
no
one
was
ever
to
set
eyes
on
and
with
her
stupid
instinct
she
preferred
to
throw
it
into
the
fire
rather
than
part
with
it
well
then
well
then
what
you
wo
find
the
aha
my
dear
count
so
you
did
for
a
moment
look
upon
my
success
as
possible
and
lupin
does
not
strike
you
as
quite
a
charlatan
make
your
mind
easy
waldemar
lupin
has
more
than
one
string
to
his
bow
i
shall
succeed
before
twelve
before
twelve
but
for
the
moment
i
am
starving
with
hunger
and
if
your
kindness
would
go
so
far
he
was
taken
to
the
sergeants
mess
and
a
substantial
meal
prepared
for
him
while
the
count
went
to
make
his
report
to
the
emperor
twenty
minutes
later
waldemar
returned
and
they
sat
down
and
dined
together
opposite
each
other
silent
and
pensive
waldemar
a
good
cigar
would
be
a
treat
i
thank
you
ah
this
one
crackles
as
a
havana
should
he
lit
his
cigar
and
after
a
minute
or
two
you
can
smoke
count
i
do
mind
in
the
least
in
fact
i
rather
like
it
an
hour
passed
waldemar
dozed
and
from
time
to
time
swallowed
a
glass
of
brandy
to
wake
himself
up
soldiers
passed
in
and
out
waiting
on
them
coffee
asked
lupin
they
brought
him
some
coffee
what
bad
stuff
he
grumbled
if
that
what
cæsar
drinks
give
me
another
cup
all
the
same
waldemar
we
may
have
a
long
night
before
us
oh
what
vile
coffee
he
lit
a
second
cigar
and
did
not
say
another
word
ten
minutes
passed
he
continued
not
to
move
or
speak
suddenly
waldemar
sprang
to
his
feet
and
said
to
lupin
angrily
hi
stand
up
there
lupin
was
whistling
a
tune
at
the
moment
he
kept
on
whistling
peacefully
stand
up
i
say
lupin
turned
round
his
imperial
majesty
had
just
entered
lupin
rose
from
his
chair
how
far
are
we
asked
the
emperor
i
think
sire
that
i
shall
be
able
to
satisfy
your
imperial
majesty
soon
what
do
you
know
the
very
nearly
sire
a
few
details
still
escape
me
but
everything
will
be
cleared
up
once
we
are
on
the
spot
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
are
we
to
stay
here
no
sire
i
will
beg
you
to
go
with
me
to
the
renascence
palace
but
we
have
plenty
of
time
and
if
your
imperial
majesty
will
permit
me
i
should
like
first
to
think
over
two
or
three
points
without
waiting
for
the
reply
he
sat
down
to
waldemar
great
indignation
in
a
few
minutes
the
emperor
who
had
walked
away
and
was
talking
to
the
count
came
up
to
him
are
you
ready
now
m
lupin
lupin
kept
silence
a
fresh
question
his
head
fell
on
his
chest
but
he
asleep
i
really
believe
that
he
asleep
waldemar
beside
himself
with
rage
shook
him
violently
by
the
shoulder
lupin
fell
from
his
chair
sank
to
the
floor
gave
two
or
three
convulsive
movements
and
then
lay
quite
still
what
the
matter
with
him
exclaimed
the
emperor
he
not
dead
i
hope
he
took
a
lamp
and
bent
over
him
how
pale
he
is
a
face
like
wax
look
waldemar
feel
his
heart
he
alive
is
he
not
yes
sire
said
the
count
after
a
moment
the
heart
is
beating
quite
regularly
then
what
is
it
i
do
understand
what
happened
shall
i
go
and
fetch
the
doctor
yes
run
the
doctor
found
lupin
in
the
same
state
lying
inert
and
quiet
he
had
him
put
on
a
bed
subjected
him
to
a
long
examination
and
asked
what
he
had
had
to
eat
do
you
suspect
a
case
of
poisoning
doctor
no
sire
there
are
no
traces
of
poisoning
but
i
am
thinking
what
on
that
tray
and
in
that
cup
coffee
said
the
count
for
you
no
for
him
i
did
not
have
any
the
doctor
poured
out
some
coffee
tasted
it
and
said
i
was
right
he
has
been
put
to
sleep
with
a
narcotic
but
by
whom
cried
the
emperor
angrily
look
here
waldemar
exasperating
the
way
things
happen
in
this
place
sire
well
yes
i
had
enough
of
it
i
am
really
beginning
to
believe
that
the
man
right
and
that
there
is
some
one
in
the
castle
that
french
money
that
narcotic
if
any
one
had
got
into
this
enclosure
sire
it
would
be
known
by
this
time
we
been
hunting
in
every
direction
for
three
hours
still
i
did
make
the
coffee
i
assure
you
and
unless
you
did
oh
sire
well
then
hunt
about
search
you
have
two
hundred
men
at
your
disposal
and
the
are
not
so
large
as
all
that
for
after
all
the
ruffian
is
prowling
round
here
round
these
buildings
near
the
kitchen
somewhere
or
other
go
and
bustle
about
the
fat
waldemar
bustled
about
all
night
conscientiously
because
it
was
the
master
order
but
without
conviction
because
it
was
impossible
for
a
stranger
to
hide
among
ruins
which
were
so
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
event
proved
that
he
was
right
the
investigations
were
fruitless
and
no
one
was
able
to
discover
the
mysterious
hand
that
had
prepared
the
narcotic
drink
lupin
spent
the
night
lifeless
on
his
bed
in
the
morning
the
doctor
who
had
not
left
his
side
told
a
messenger
of
the
emperor
that
he
was
still
asleep
at
nine
however
he
made
his
first
movement
a
sort
of
effort
to
wake
up
later
on
he
stammered
what
time
is
it
to
ten
he
made
a
fresh
effort
and
it
was
evident
that
in
the
midst
of
his
torpor
his
whole
being
was
intent
upon
returning
to
life
a
clock
struck
ten
he
started
and
said
let
them
carry
me
let
them
carry
me
to
the
palace
with
the
doctor
approval
waldemar
called
his
men
and
sent
word
to
the
emperor
they
laid
lupin
on
a
stretcher
and
set
out
for
the
palace
the
first
floor
he
muttered
they
carried
him
up
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
he
said
the
last
room
on
the
left
they
carried
him
to
the
last
room
which
was
the
twelfth
and
gave
him
a
chair
on
which
he
sat
down
exhausted
the
emperor
arrived
lupin
did
not
stir
sat
looking
unconscious
with
no
expression
in
his
eyes
then
in
a
few
minutes
he
seemed
to
wake
looked
round
him
at
the
walls
the
ceilings
the
people
and
said
a
narcotic
i
suppose
yes
said
the
doctor
have
they
found
the
man
no
he
seemed
to
be
meditating
and
several
times
jerked
his
head
with
a
thoughtful
air
but
they
soon
saw
that
he
was
asleep
the
emperor
went
up
to
waldemar
order
your
car
round
oh
but
then
sire
well
what
i
am
beginning
to
think
that
he
is
taking
us
in
and
that
all
this
is
merely
to
gain
time
possibly
yes
said
waldemar
agreeing
it
quite
obvious
he
is
making
the
most
of
certain
curious
coincidences
but
he
knows
nothing
and
his
story
about
gold
coins
and
his
narcotic
are
so
many
inventions
if
we
lend
ourselves
to
his
little
game
any
longer
he
slip
out
of
your
fingers
your
car
waldemar
the
count
gave
his
orders
and
returned
lupin
had
not
woke
up
the
emperor
who
was
looking
round
the
room
said
to
waldemar
this
is
the
minerva
room
is
it
not
yes
sire
but
then
why
is
there
an
in
two
places
there
were
in
fact
two
n
one
over
the
chimneypiece
the
other
over
an
old
dilapidated
clock
fitted
into
the
wall
and
displaying
a
complicated
set
of
works
with
weights
hanging
lifeless
at
the
end
of
their
cords
the
two
said
waldemar
the
emperor
did
not
listen
to
the
answer
lupin
had
moved
again
opening
his
eyes
and
uttering
indistinct
syllables
he
stood
up
walked
across
the
room
and
fell
down
from
sheer
weakness
then
came
the
struggle
the
desperate
struggle
of
his
brain
his
nerves
his
will
against
that
hideous
paralyzing
torpor
the
struggle
of
a
dying
man
against
death
the
struggle
of
life
against
extinction
and
the
sight
was
one
of
infinite
sadness
he
is
suffering
muttered
waldemar
or
at
least
he
is
pretending
to
suffer
declared
the
emperor
and
pretending
very
cleverly
at
that
what
an
actor
lupin
stammered
an
injection
doctor
an
injection
of
caffeine
at
once
may
i
sire
asked
the
doctor
certainly
until
twelve
do
all
that
he
asks
he
has
my
promise
how
many
minutes
before
twelve
asked
lupin
forty
said
somebody
forty
i
shall
do
it
i
am
sure
to
do
it
i
got
to
do
it
he
took
his
head
in
his
two
hands
oh
if
i
had
my
brain
the
real
brain
the
brain
that
thinks
it
would
be
a
matter
of
a
second
there
is
only
one
dark
spot
left
but
i
can
not
my
thoughts
escape
me
i
ca
grasp
it
it
awful
his
shoulders
shook
was
he
crying
they
heard
him
repeating
and
in
a
lower
voice
an
a
a
yes
of
course
but
why
that
not
enough
the
emperor
muttered
he
impresses
me
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
a
man
can
play
a
part
like
that
eleven
struck
a
quarter
to
twelve
lupin
remained
motionless
with
his
fists
glued
to
his
temples
the
emperor
waited
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
chronometer
which
waldemar
held
in
his
hand
ten
minutes
more
five
minutes
more
is
the
car
there
waldemar
are
your
men
ready
yes
sire
is
that
watch
of
yours
a
repeater
waldemar
yes
sire
at
the
last
stroke
of
twelve
then
but
at
the
last
stroke
of
twelve
waldemar
there
was
really
something
tragic
about
the
scene
that
sort
of
grandeur
and
solemnity
which
the
hours
assume
at
the
approach
of
a
possible
miracle
when
it
seems
as
though
the
voice
of
fate
itself
were
about
to
find
utterance
the
emperor
did
not
conceal
his
anguish
this
fantastic
adventurer
who
was
called
arsène
lupin
and
whose
amazing
life
he
knew
this
man
troubled
him
and
although
he
was
resolved
to
make
an
end
of
all
this
dubious
story
he
could
not
help
waiting
and
hoping
two
minutes
more
one
minute
more
then
they
counted
by
seconds
lupin
seemed
asleep
come
get
ready
said
the
emperor
to
the
count
the
count
went
up
to
lupin
and
placed
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
silvery
chime
of
the
repeater
quivered
and
struck
one
two
three
four
five
waldemar
old
chap
pull
the
weights
of
the
old
clock
a
moment
of
stupefaction
it
was
lupin
voice
speaking
very
calmly
waldemar
annoyed
at
the
familiarity
of
the
address
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
as
he
says
waldemar
said
the
emperor
yes
do
as
i
say
my
dear
count
echoed
lupin
recovering
his
powers
of
chaff
you
know
the
ropes
so
well
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
pull
those
of
the
clock
in
turns
one
two
capital
that
how
they
used
to
wind
it
up
in
the
old
days
the
pendulum
in
fact
was
started
and
they
heard
its
regular
ticking
now
the
hands
said
lupin
set
them
at
a
little
before
twelve
do
move
let
me
he
rose
and
walked
to
the
face
of
the
clock
standing
two
feet
away
at
most
with
his
eyes
fixed
with
every
nerve
attentive
the
twelve
strokes
sounded
twelve
heavy
deep
strokes
a
long
silence
nothing
happened
nevertheless
the
emperor
waited
as
though
he
were
sure
that
something
was
going
to
happen
and
waldemar
did
not
move
stood
with
eyes
lupin
who
had
stooped
over
the
now
drew
himself
up
muttering
that
it
i
have
it
he
went
back
to
his
chair
and
commanded
waldemar
set
the
hands
at
two
minutes
to
twelve
again
oh
no
old
chap
not
backwards
the
way
the
hands
go
yes
i
know
it
will
take
rather
long
but
it
ca
be
helped
all
the
hours
struck
and
the
half
hours
up
to
eleven
listen
waldemar
said
lupin
and
he
spoke
seriously
without
jesting
as
though
himself
excited
and
anxious
listen
waldemar
do
you
see
on
the
face
of
the
clock
a
little
round
dot
marking
the
first
hour
that
dot
is
loose
is
it
put
the
of
your
left
hand
on
it
and
press
good
do
the
same
with
your
thumb
on
the
dot
marking
the
third
hour
good
with
your
right
hand
push
in
the
dot
at
the
eighth
hour
good
thank
you
go
and
sit
down
my
dear
fellow
the
shifted
moved
to
the
twelfth
dot
and
the
clock
struck
again
lupin
was
silent
and
very
white
the
twelve
strokes
rang
out
in
the
silence
at
the
twelfth
stroke
there
was
a
sound
as
of
a
spring
being
set
free
the
clock
stopped
dead
the
pendulum
ceased
swinging
and
suddenly
the
bronze
ornament
representing
a
ram
head
which
crowned
the
dial
fell
forwards
uncovering
a
sort
of
little
recess
cut
out
of
the
stone
wall
in
this
recess
was
a
chased
silver
casket
lupin
took
it
and
carried
it
to
the
emperor
would
your
imperial
majesty
be
so
good
as
to
open
it
yourself
the
letters
which
you
instructed
me
to
look
for
are
inside
the
emperor
raised
the
lid
and
seemed
greatly
astonished
casket
was
the
casket
was
empty
it
was
an
enormous
unforeseen
sensation
after
the
success
of
the
calculation
made
by
lupin
after
the
ingenious
discovery
of
the
secret
of
the
clock
the
emperor
who
had
no
doubt
left
as
to
the
ultimate
success
appeared
utterly
confounded
opposite
him
was
lupin
pallid
and
wan
with
drawn
jaws
and
bloodshot
eyes
gnashing
his
teeth
with
rage
and
impotent
hate
he
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
then
snatched
up
the
casket
turned
it
over
examined
it
as
though
he
hoped
to
find
a
false
bottom
at
last
for
greater
certainty
in
a
fit
of
fury
he
crushed
it
with
an
irresistible
grip
that
relieved
him
he
breathed
more
easily
the
emperor
said
who
has
done
this
still
the
same
man
sire
the
one
who
is
following
the
same
road
as
i
and
pursuing
the
same
aim
kesselbach
murderer
when
last
night
ah
sire
why
did
you
not
leave
me
free
when
i
came
out
of
prison
had
i
been
free
i
should
have
come
here
without
losing
an
hour
i
should
have
arrived
before
him
i
should
have
given
isilda
money
before
he
did
i
should
have
read
malreich
the
old
french
diary
before
he
did
so
you
think
that
it
was
through
the
revelations
in
the
diary
why
yes
sire
he
had
time
to
read
them
and
lurking
i
do
know
where
kept
informed
of
all
our
movements
by
i
do
know
whom
he
put
me
to
sleep
last
night
in
order
to
get
rid
of
me
but
the
palace
was
guarded
guarded
by
your
soldiers
sire
does
that
count
with
a
man
like
him
besides
i
have
no
doubt
that
waldemar
concentrated
his
search
upon
the
thus
thinning
the
posts
in
the
palace
but
the
sound
of
the
clock
those
twelve
strokes
in
the
night
it
was
mere
child
play
sire
mere
child
play
to
him
to
prevent
the
clock
from
striking
all
this
seems
very
impossible
to
my
mind
it
all
seems
monstrous
clear
to
mine
sire
if
it
were
possible
to
feel
in
every
one
of
your
soldiers
pockets
here
and
now
or
to
know
how
much
money
they
will
each
of
them
spend
during
the
next
twelve
months
we
should
be
sure
to
find
two
or
three
who
are
at
this
moment
in
possession
of
a
few
french
of
course
oh
protested
waldemar
but
yes
my
dear
count
it
is
a
question
of
price
and
that
makes
no
difference
to
if
wished
i
am
sure
that
you
yourself
the
emperor
wrapped
up
in
his
own
thoughts
was
not
listening
he
walked
across
the
room
from
left
to
right
and
right
to
left
then
beckoned
to
one
of
the
officers
standing
in
the
gallery
my
car
and
tell
them
to
get
ready
we
starting
he
stopped
watched
lupin
for
a
moment
and
going
up
to
the
count
you
too
waldemar
be
off
straight
to
paris
without
a
break
lupin
pricked
up
his
ears
he
heard
waldemar
reply
i
should
like
to
have
a
dozen
additional
guards
with
that
devil
of
a
man
take
them
and
look
sharp
you
must
get
there
lupin
stamped
his
foot
violently
on
the
floor
well
no
sire
no
no
no
it
sha
be
i
swear
it
sha
no
no
never
what
do
you
mean
and
the
letters
sire
the
stolen
letters
upon
my
word
so
cried
lupin
indignantly
folding
his
arms
so
your
imperial
majesty
gives
up
the
struggle
you
look
upon
the
defeat
as
irretrievable
you
declare
yourself
beaten
well
i
do
not
sire
i
have
begun
and
i
mean
to
finish
the
emperor
smiled
at
this
display
of
mettle
i
do
not
give
up
but
my
police
will
set
to
work
lupin
burst
out
laughing
excuse
me
sire
it
is
so
funny
your
police
your
imperial
police
why
they
worth
just
about
as
much
as
any
other
police
that
is
to
say
nothing
nothing
at
all
no
sire
i
will
not
return
to
the
santé
prison
i
can
afford
to
laugh
at
but
time
enough
has
been
wasted
as
it
is
i
need
my
freedom
against
that
man
and
i
mean
to
keep
it
the
emperor
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
do
even
know
who
the
man
is
i
shall
know
sire
and
i
alone
can
know
and
he
knows
that
i
am
the
only
one
who
can
know
i
am
his
only
enemy
i
am
the
only
one
whom
he
attacks
it
was
i
whom
he
meant
to
hit
the
other
day
when
he
fired
his
revolver
he
considered
it
enough
to
put
me
and
me
only
to
sleep
last
night
to
be
free
to
do
as
he
pleased
the
fight
lies
between
him
and
me
the
outside
world
has
nothing
to
say
to
it
no
one
can
help
me
and
no
one
can
help
him
there
are
two
of
us
and
that
is
all
so
far
chance
has
favored
him
but
in
the
long
run
it
is
inevitable
it
is
doomed
that
i
should
gain
the
day
why
because
i
am
the
better
man
suppose
he
kills
you
he
will
not
kill
me
i
shall
draw
his
claws
i
shall
make
him
perfectly
harmless
and
you
shall
have
the
letters
sire
they
are
yours
there
is
no
power
on
earth
than
can
prevent
me
from
restoring
them
to
you
he
spoke
with
a
violent
conviction
and
a
tone
of
certainty
that
gave
to
the
things
which
he
foretold
the
real
appearance
of
things
already
accomplished
the
emperor
could
not
help
undergoing
a
vague
inexplicable
feeling
in
which
there
was
a
sort
of
admiration
combined
with
a
good
deal
of
that
confidence
which
lupin
was
demanding
in
so
masterful
a
manner
in
reality
he
was
hesitating
only
because
of
his
scruples
against
employing
this
man
and
making
him
so
to
speak
his
ally
and
anxiously
not
knowing
what
decision
to
take
he
walked
from
the
gallery
to
the
windows
without
saying
a
word
at
last
he
asked
and
who
says
that
the
letters
were
stolen
last
night
the
theft
is
dated
sire
what
do
you
say
look
at
the
inner
side
of
the
pediment
which
concealed
the
the
date
is
written
in
white
chalk
august
so
it
is
muttered
the
emperor
nonplussed
how
was
it
that
i
did
not
see
and
he
added
betraying
his
curiosity
just
as
with
those
two
painted
on
the
wall
i
ca
understand
this
is
the
minerva
room
this
is
the
room
in
which
napoleon
the
emperor
of
the
french
slept
said
lupin
how
do
you
know
ask
waldemar
sire
as
for
myself
when
i
was
turning
over
the
old
servants
diary
it
came
upon
me
as
a
flash
of
light
i
understood
that
shears
and
i
had
been
on
the
wrong
scent
apoon
the
imperfect
word
written
by
the
hermann
on
his
is
a
contraction
not
of
apollon
but
of
napoleon
that
true
you
are
right
said
the
emperor
the
same
letters
occur
in
both
words
and
in
the
same
order
the
evidently
meant
to
write
but
that
figure
ah
that
was
the
point
that
gave
me
most
trouble
i
always
had
an
idea
that
we
must
add
up
the
three
figures
and
and
the
number
thus
obtained
seemed
to
me
at
once
to
apply
to
this
room
which
is
the
twelfth
leading
out
of
the
gallery
but
that
was
not
enough
for
me
there
must
be
something
else
something
which
my
enfeebled
brain
could
not
succeed
in
translating
into
words
the
sight
of
that
clock
situated
precisely
in
the
napoleon
room
was
a
revelation
to
me
the
number
evidently
meant
twelve
the
hour
of
noon
the
hour
of
midnight
is
this
not
the
solemn
moment
which
a
man
most
readily
selects
but
why
those
three
figures
and
rather
than
any
others
which
would
have
given
the
same
total
it
was
then
that
i
thought
of
making
the
clock
strike
for
the
first
time
by
way
of
experiment
and
it
was
while
making
it
strike
that
i
saw
the
dots
of
the
first
third
and
eighth
hour
were
movable
and
that
they
alone
were
movable
i
therefore
obtained
three
figures
and
which
placed
in
a
more
prophetic
order
gave
the
number
waldemar
pushed
the
three
dots
the
spring
was
released
and
your
imperial
majesty
knows
the
result
this
sire
is
the
explanation
of
that
mysterious
word
and
of
those
three
figures
which
the
wrote
with
his
dying
hand
and
by
the
aid
of
which
he
hoped
that
his
son
would
one
day
recover
the
secret
of
veldenz
and
become
the
possessor
of
the
famous
letters
which
he
had
hidden
there
the
emperor
listened
with
eager
attention
more
and
more
surprised
at
the
ingenuity
perspicacity
shrewdness
and
intelligent
will
which
he
observed
in
the
man
waldemar
he
said
when
lupin
had
finished
sire
but
just
as
he
was
about
to
speak
shouts
were
heard
in
the
gallery
outside
waldemar
left
the
room
and
returned
it
the
mad
girl
sire
they
wo
let
her
pass
let
her
come
in
cried
lupin
eagerly
she
must
come
in
sire
at
a
sign
from
the
emperor
waldemar
went
out
to
fetch
isilda
her
entrance
caused
a
general
stupefaction
her
pale
face
was
covered
with
dark
blotches
her
distorted
features
bore
signs
of
the
keenest
suffering
she
panted
for
breath
with
her
two
hands
clutched
against
her
breast
oh
cried
lupin
struck
with
horror
what
is
it
asked
the
emperor
your
doctor
sire
there
is
not
a
moment
to
lose
he
went
up
to
her
speak
isilda
have
you
seen
anything
have
you
anything
to
say
the
girl
had
stopped
her
eyes
were
less
vacant
as
though
lighted
up
by
the
pain
she
uttered
sounds
but
not
a
word
listen
said
lupin
answer
yes
or
no
make
a
movement
of
the
head
have
you
seen
him
do
you
know
where
he
is
you
know
who
he
is
listen
if
you
do
answer
he
suppressed
a
gesture
of
anger
but
suddenly
remembering
the
experiment
of
the
day
before
and
that
she
seemed
rather
to
have
retained
a
certain
optical
memory
of
the
time
when
she
enjoyed
her
full
reason
he
wrote
on
the
white
wall
a
capital
l
and
she
stretched
out
her
arm
toward
the
letters
and
nodded
her
head
as
though
in
assent
and
then
said
lupin
what
then
write
something
yourself
but
she
gave
a
fearful
scream
and
flung
herself
to
the
ground
yelling
then
suddenly
came
silence
immobility
one
last
convulsive
spasm
and
she
moved
no
more
dead
asked
the
emperor
poisoned
sire
oh
the
poor
thing
and
by
whom
by
sire
she
knew
him
no
doubt
he
must
have
been
afraid
of
what
she
might
tell
the
doctor
arrived
the
emperor
pointed
to
the
girl
then
addressing
waldemar
all
your
men
to
turn
out
make
them
go
through
the
houses
telegraph
to
the
stations
on
the
frontier
he
went
up
to
lupin
how
long
do
you
want
to
recover
the
letters
a
month
sire
two
months
at
most
very
well
waldemar
will
wait
for
you
here
he
shall
have
my
orders
and
full
powers
to
grant
you
anything
you
wish
what
i
should
like
sire
is
my
freedom
you
are
free
lupin
watched
him
walk
away
and
said
between
his
teeth
my
freedom
first
and
afterward
when
i
have
given
you
back
the
letters
o
majesty
one
little
shake
of
the
hand
then
we
shall
be
quits

the

scoundrels

you
see
this
gentleman
dolores

took
the
card
from
the
footman
and
read
andré
beauny
no
she
said
i
do
know
him
the
gentleman
seems
very
anxious
to
see
you
he
says
that
you
are
expecting
him
oh
possibly
yes
bring
him
here
since
the
events
which
had
upset
her
life
and
pursued
her
with
relentless
animosity
dolores
after
staying
at
the
hôtel
bristol
had
taken
up
her
abode
in
a
quiet
house
in
the
rue
des
vignes
down
at
passy
a
pretty
garden
lay
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
was
surrounded
by
other
leafy
gardens
on
days
when
attacks
more
painful
than
usual
did
not
keep
her
from
morning
till
night
behind
the
closed
shutters
of
her
bedroom
she
made
her
servants
carry
her
under
the
trees
where
she
lay
stretched
at
full
length
a
victim
to
melancholy
incapable
of
fighting
against
her
hard
fate
footsteps
sounded
on
the
and
the
footman
returned
followed
by
a
young
man
smart
in
appearance
and
very
simply
dressed
in
the
rather
fashion
adopted
by
some
of
our
painters
with
a
collar
and
a
flowing
necktie
of
white
spots
on
a
blue
ground
the
footman
withdrew
your
name
is
andré
beauny
i
believe
said
dolores
yes
madame
i
have
not
the
honor
i
beg
your
pardon
madame
knowing
that
i
was
a
friend
of
mme
ernemont
geneviève
grandmother
you
wrote
to
her
at
garches
saying
that
you
wished
to
speak
to
me
i
have
come
dolores
rose
in
her
seat
very
excitedly
oh
you
are
yes
she
stammered
really
is
it
you
i
do
not
recognize
you
you
do
recognize
prince
paul
sernine
no
everything
is
different
the
forehead
the
eyes
and
that
is
not
how
the
how
the
newspapers
represented
the
prisoner
at
the
santé
he
said
with
a
smile
and
yet
it
is
i
really
a
long
silence
followed
during
which
they
remained
embarrassed
and
ill
at
ease
at
last
he
asked
may
i
know
the
reason
did
not
geneviève
tell
you
i
have
not
seen
her
but
her
grandmother
seemed
to
think
that
you
required
my
services
that
right
that
right
and
in
what
way
i
am
so
pleased
she
hesitated
a
second
and
then
whispered
i
am
afraid
afraid
he
cried
yes
she
said
speaking
in
a
low
voice
i
am
afraid
afraid
of
everything
afraid
of
and
of
and
of
the
day
after
afraid
of
life
i
have
suffered
so
much
i
can
bear
no
more
he
looked
at
her
with
great
pity
in
his
eyes
the
vague
feeling
that
had
always
drawn
him
to
this
woman
took
a
more
precise
character
now
that
she
was
asking
for
his
protection
he
felt
an
eager
need
to
devote
himself
to
her
wholly
without
hope
of
reward
she
continued
i
am
alone
now
quite
alone
with
servants
whom
i
have
picked
up
on
chance
and
i
am
afraid
i
feel
that
people
are
moving
about
me
but
with
what
object
i
do
not
know
but
the
enemy
is
hovering
around
and
coming
closer
have
you
seen
him
have
you
noticed
anything
yes
the
other
day
two
men
passed
several
times
in
the
street
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
house
can
you
describe
them
i
saw
one
of
them
better
than
the
other
he
was
tall
and
powerful
and
wore
a
little
black
cloth
jacket
cut
quite
short
a
waiter
at
a
café
perhaps
yes
a
i
had
him
followed
by
one
of
my
servants
he
went
down
the
rue
de
la
pompe
and
entered
a
house
the
is
occupied
by
a
it
is
the
first
house
in
the
street
on
the
left
then
a
night
or
two
ago
i
saw
a
shadow
in
the
garden
from
my
bedroom
window
is
that
all
yes
he
thought
and
then
made
a
suggestion
would
you
allow
two
of
my
men
to
sleep
downstairs
in
one
of
the
rooms
two
of
your
men
oh
you
need
not
be
afraid
they
are
decent
men
old
charolais
and
his
son
and
they
do
look
in
the
least
like
what
they
are
you
will
be
quite
safe
with
them
as
for
me
footnote
see
by
edgar
jepson
and
maurice
leblanc
he
hesitated
he
was
waiting
for
her
to
ask
him
to
come
again
as
she
was
silent
he
said
as
for
me
it
is
better
that
i
should
not
be
seen
here
yes
it
is
better
for
your
sake
my
men
will
let
me
know
how
things
go
on
he
would
have
liked
to
say
more
and
to
remain
and
to
sit
down
beside
her
and
comfort
her
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
they
had
said
all
that
they
had
to
say
and
that
a
single
word
more
on
his
side
would
be
an
insult
then
he
made
her
a
very
low
bow
and
went
away
he
went
up
the
garden
walking
quickly
in
his
haste
to
be
outside
and
master
his
emotion
the
footman
was
waiting
for
him
at
the
as
he
passed
out
into
the
street
somebody
rang
a
young
woman
he
gave
a
start
geneviève
she
fixed
a
pair
of
astonished
eyes
upon
him
and
at
once
recognized
him
although
bewildered
by
the
extreme
youthfulness
of
his
appearance
and
this
gave
her
such
a
shock
that
she
staggered
and
had
to
lean
against
the
door
for
support
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
and
was
looking
at
her
without
daring
to
put
out
his
hand
would
she
put
out
hers
he
was
no
longer
prince
sernine
he
was
arsène
lupin
and
she
knew
that
he
was
arsène
lupin
and
that
he
had
just
come
out
of
prison
it
was
raining
outside
she
gave
her
umbrella
to
the
footman
and
said
please
open
it
and
put
it
somewhere
to
dry
then
she
walked
straight
in
my
poor
old
chap
said
lupin
to
himself
as
he
walked
away
what
a
series
of
blows
for
a
sensitive
and
creature
like
yourself
you
must
keep
a
watch
on
your
heart
or
ah
what
next
here
are
my
eyes
beginning
to
water
now
that
a
bad
sign
lupin
you
growing
old
he
gave
a
tap
on
the
shoulder
to
a
young
man
who
was
crossing
the
chaussee
de
la
muette
and
going
toward
the
rue
des
vignes
the
young
man
stopped
stared
at
him
and
said
i
beg
your
pardon

but
i
do
think
i
have
the
honor
think
again
my
dear
leduc
or
has
your
memory
quite
gone
do

remember
versailles
and
the
little
room
at
the
hôtel
des
the
young
man
bounded
backwards
you
why
yes
i
prince
sernine
or
rather
lupin
since

know
my
real
name
did
you
think
that
lupin
had
departed
this
life
oh

see

were
hoping

out
you
baby
he
patted
him
gently
on
the
shoulder
there

a
few
nice
quiet
days
left
to
write
your
poems

verses
poet
then
he
gripped
leduc
arm
violently
and
looking

full
in
the
face
said
but
the
time

drawing
near
poet

and
magnificent
part

man
to
play

he
burst
out
laughing
turned
on
one
foot
and
left
young
leduc
astounded
a
little
further
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
de
la
pompe
stood
the
of
which
kesselbach
had
spoken
to
him
he
went
in
and
had
a
long
talk
with
the
proprietor
then
he
took
a
taxi
and
drove
to
the
grand
hotel
where
he
was
staying
under
the
name
of
andré
beauny
and
found
the
brothers
doudeville
waiting
for
him
lupin
though
used
to
that
sort
of
pleasure
nevertheless
enjoyed
the
marks
of
admiration
and
devotion
with
which
his
friends
overwhelmed
him
but
governor
tell
us
what
happened
we
accustomed
to
all
sorts
of
wonders
with
you
but
still
there
are
limits
so
you
are
free
and
here
you
are
in
the
heart
of
paris
scarcely
disguised
have
a
cigar
said
lupin
thank
you
no
you
wrong
doudeville
these
are
worth
smoking
i
have
them
from
a
great
connoisseur
who
is
good
enough
to
call
himself
my
friend
oh
may
one
ask
the
kaiser
come
do
look
so
flabbergasted
the
two
of
you
and
tell
me
things
i
have
seen
the
papers
what
effect
did
my
escape
have
on
the
public
tremendous
governor
what
was
the
police
version
your
flight
took
place
at
garches
during
an
attempt
to
reënact
the
murder
of
altenheim
unfortunately
the
journalists
have
proved
that
it
was
impossible
after
that
after
that
a
general
fluster
people
wondering
laughing
and
enjoying
themselves
like
mad
weber
weber
is
badly
let
in
apart
from
that
no
news
at
the
nothing
discovered
about
the
murderer
no
clue
to
help
us
to
establish
identity
no
what
fools
they
are
and
to
think
that
we
pay
millions
a
year
to
keep
those
people
if
this
sort
of
thing
goes
on
i
shall
refuse
to
pay
my
rates
take
a
seat
and
a
pen
i
will
dictate
a
letter
which
you
must
hand
in
to
the
this
evening
the
world
has
been
waiting
for
news
of
me
long
enough
it
must
be
gasping
with
impatience
write
he
dictated
to
the
editor
of
the
sir
i
must
apologize
to
your
readers
for
disappointing
their
legitimate
impatience
i
have
escaped
from
prison
and
i
can
not
possibly
reveal
how
i
escaped
in
the
same
way
since
my
escape
i
have
discovered
the
famous
secret
and
i
can
not
possibly
disclose
what
the
secret
is
nor
how
i
discovered
it
all
this
will
some
day
or
other
form
the
subject
of
a
rather
original
story
which
my
will
publish
from
my
notes
it
will
form
a
page
of
the
history
of
france
which
our
grandchildren
will
read
with
interest
for
the
moment
i
have
more
important
matters
to
attend
to
disgusted
at
seeing
into
what
hands
the
functions
which
i
once
exercised
have
fallen
tired
of
finding
the
case
still
dragging
along
i
am
discharging
weber
and
resuming
the
post
of
honor
which
i
occupied
with
such
distinction
and
to
the
general
satisfaction
under
the
name
of
lenormand
i
am
sir
your
obedient
servant
arsène
lupin
of
the
at
eight
in
the
evening
arsène
lupin
and
jean
doudeville
walked
into
caillard
the
fashionable
restaurant
lupin
in
but
dressed
like
an
artist
with
rather
wide
trousers
and
a
rather
loose
tie
and
doudeville
in
a
with
the
serious
air
and
appearance
of
a
magistrate
they
sat
down
in
that
part
of
the
restaurant
which
is
set
back
and
divided
from
the
big
room
by
two
columns
a
perfectly
dressed
and
supercilious
in
manner
came
to
take
their
orders
in
hand
lupin
selected
the
dinner
with
the
nice
thought
of
an
accomplished
epicure
certainly
he
said
the
prison
ordinary
was
quite
acceptable
but
all
the
same
it
is
nice
to
have
a
meal
he
ate
with
a
good
appetite
and
silently
contenting
himself
with
uttering
from
time
to
time
a
short
sentence
that
marked
his
train
of
thought
of
course
i
shall
manage
but
it
will
be
a
hard
job
such
an
adversary
what
staggers
me
is
that
after
six
fighting
i
do
even
know
what
he
wants
his
chief
accomplice
is
dead
we
are
near
the
end
of
the
battle
and
yet
even
now
i
understand
his
game
what
is
the
wretch
after
my
own
plan
is
quite
clear
to
lay
hands
on
the
to
shove
a
of
my
own
making
on
the
throne
to
give
him
geneviève
for
a
wife
and

standing

with

to

as

chevalier
de
malreich

gave
a
jump
in
his
chair
what
what
do
you
say
the
chevalier
say
it
again
the
chevalier
raoul
de
malreich
a
long
pause
lupin
with
his
eyes
fixed
before
him
thought
of
the
mad
girl
at
veldenz
who
had
died
by
poison
isilda
bore
the
same
name
malreich
and
it
was
the
name
borne
by
the
small
french
noble
who
came
to
the
court
of
veldenz
in
the
eighteenth
century
he
resumed
his
questions
what
country
did
this
malreich
belong
to
he
was
of
french
origin
but
born
in
germany
i
saw
some
papers
once
that
was
how
i
came
to
know
his
name
oh
if
he
had
found
it
out
he
would
have
wrung
my
neck
i
believe
lupin
reflected
and
said
did
he
command
the
lot
of
you
yes
but
he
had
an
accomplice
a
partner
oh
hush
hush
the
face
suddenly
expressed
the
most
intense
alarm
lupin
noticed
the
same
sort
of
terror
and
repulsion
which
he
himself
felt
when
he
thought
of
the
murderer
who
is
he
have
you
seen
him
oh
do
let
us
talk
of
that
one
it
does
do
to
talk
of
him
who
is
he
i
asking
you
he
is
the
master
the
chief
nobody
knows
him
but
you
seen
him
you
answer
me
have
you
seen
him
sometimes
in
the
dark
at
night
never
by
daylight
his
orders
come
on
little
scraps
of
paper
or
by
telephone
his
name
i
do
know
it
we
never
used
to
speak
of
him
it
was
unlucky
he
dresses
in
black
does
he
yes
in
black
he
is
short
and
slender
with
fair
hair
and
he
kills
does
he
yes
he
kills
he
kills
where
another
might
steal
a
bit
of
bread
his
voice
shook
he
entreated
let
us
stop
this
it
wo
do
to
talk
of
him
i
tell
you
it
unlucky
lupin
was
silent
impressed
in
spite
of
himself
by
the
man
anguish
he
sat
long
thinking
and
then
rose
and
said
to
the
here
here
your
money
but
if
you
want
to
live
in
peace
you
will
do
well
not
to
breathe
a
word
of
our
conversation
to
anybody
he
left
the
restaurant
with
doudeville
and
walked
to
the
porte
without
speaking
absorbed
in
all
that
he
had
heard
at
last
he
seized
his
companion
arm
and
said
listen
to
me
doudeville

the
gare
du
nord

word
more
on
saturday
meet
me
at
twelve
in
a
little
café
on
the
route
de
la
revolte
called
the
restaurant
buffalo
come
dressed
as
a
workman
the
next
day
lupin
wearing
a
short
smock
and
a
cap
went
down
to
neuilly
and
began
his
investigations
at
no
route
de
la
revolte
a
gateway
opened
into
an
outer
yard
and
here
he
found
a
huge
block
of
workmen
dwellings
a
whole
series
of
passages
and
workshops
with
a
swarming
population
of
artisans
women
and
brats
in
a
few
minutes
he
had
won
the
of
the
portress
with
whom
he
chatted
for
an
hour
on
the
most
varied
topics
during
this
hour
he
saw
three
men
pass
one
after
the
other
whose
manner
struck
him
that
game
he
thought
and
gamy
game
at
that
they
follow
one
another
by
scent
look
quite
respectable
of
course
but
with
the
eye
of
the
hunted
deer
which
knows
that
the
enemy
is
all
around
and
that
every
tuft
every
blade
of
grass
may
conceal
an
ambush
that
afternoon
and
on
the
saturday
morning
he
pursued
his
inquiries
and
made
certain
that
altenheim
seven
accomplices
all
lived
on
the
premises
four
of
them
openly
followed
the
trade
of
two
of
the
others
sold
newspapers
and
the
third
described
himself
as
a
broker
and
was
nicknamed
accordingly
they
went
in
and
out
one
after
the
other
without
appearing
to
know
one
another
but
in
the
evening
lupin
discovered
that
they
met
in
a
sort
of
situated
right
at
the
back
of
the
last
of
the
yards
a
place
in
which
the
broker
kept
his
wares
piled
up
old
iron
broken
rusty
and
also
no
doubt
the
best
part
of
the
stolen
goods
come
he
said
the
work
is
shaping
nicely
i
asked
my
cousin
of
germany
for
a
month
and
i
believe
a
fortnight
will
be
enough
for
my
purpose
and
what
i
like
about
it
is
that
i
shall
start
operations
with
the
scoundrels
who
made
me
take
a
header
in
the
seine
my
poor
old
gourel
i
shall
revenge
you
at
last
and
high
time
too
at
twelve
on
saturday
he
went
to
the
restaurant
buffalo
a
little
room
to
which
and
resorted
for
their
meal
some
one
came
and
sat
down
beside
him
it
done
governor
ah

dying
to
know
have
you
the
particulars

about
them

left
three
children
three
yes
the
eldest
would
have
been
thirty
years
old
by
now
his
name
was
raoul
de
malreich
that
our
man
altenheim
next
the
youngest
of
the
children
was
a
girl
isilda
the
register

an
entry
in
fresh
ink
isilda
isilda
repeated
lupin
that

i
thought

altenheim
sister
i
saw
a
look
in
her
face
which
i
seemed
to
recognize
so
that
was
the
link
between
them
but
the
other
the
third
child
or
rather
the
second
a
son
he
would
be
by
now
his
name
louis
de
malreich
lupin
gave
a
little
start
that
it
louis
de
malreich
the
initials
the
awful
and
terrifying
signature
the
murderer
name
is
louis
de
malreich
he
was
the
brother
of
altenheim
and
the
brother
of
isilda
and
he
killed
both
of
them
for
fear
of
what
they
might
reveal
lupin
sat
long
silent
and
gloomy
under
the
obsession
no
doubt
of
the
mysterious
being
doudeville
objected
what
had
he
to
fear
from
his
sister
isilda
she
was
mad
they
told
me
mad
yes
but
capable
of
remembering
certain
details
of
her
childhood
she
must
have
recognized
the
brother
with
whom
she
grew
up
and
that
recollection
cost
her
her
life
and
he
added
mad
but
all
those
people
were
mad
the
mother
was
mad
the
father
a
dipsomaniac
altenheim
a
regular
brute
beast
isilda
a
poor
innocent
as
for
the
other
the
murderer
he
is
the
monster
the
crazy
lunatic
crazy
do
you
think
so
governor
yes
crazy
with
flashes
of
genius
of
devilish
cunning
and
intuition
but
a
fool
a
madman
like
all
that
malreich
family
only
madmen
kill
and
especially
madmen
of
his
stamp
for
after
all
he
interrupted
himself
and
his
face
underwent
so
great
a
change
that
doudeville
was
struck
by
it
what
the
matter
governor
look
a
man
had
entered
and
hung
his
hat
a
soft
black
felt
hat
on
a
peg
he
sat
down
at
a
little
table
examined
the
bill
of
fare
which
a
waiter
brought
him
gave
his
order
and
waited
motionless
with
his
body
stiff
and
erect
and
his
two
arms
crossed
over
the
and
lupin
saw
him
he
had
a
lean
hard
visage
absolutely
smooth
and
pierced
with
two
sockets
in
the
depths
of
which
appeared
a
pair
of
eyes
the
skin
seemed
stretched
from
bone
to
bone
like
a
sheet
of
parchment
so
stiff
and
so
thick
that
not
a
hair
could
have
penetrated
through
it
and
the
face
was
dismal
and
dull
no
expression
enlivened
it
no
thought
seemed
to
abide
under
that
ivory
forehead
and
the
entirely
devoid
of
lashes
never
flickered
which
gave
the
eyes
the
fixed
look
of
the
eyes
in
a
statue
lupin
beckoned
to
one
of
the
waiters
who
is
that
gentleman
the
one
eating
his
lunch
over
there
yes
he
is
a
customer
he
comes
here
two
or
three
times
a
week
can
you
tell
me
his
name
why
yes
leon
massier
oh
blurted
lupin
very
excitedly
the
same
two
letters
could
it
be
louis
de
malreich
he
watched
him
eagerly
indeed
the
man
appearance
agreed
with
conjectures
with
what
he
knew
of
him
and
of
his
hideous
mode
of
existence
but
what
puzzled
him
was
that
look
of
death
about
him
where
he
anticipated
life
and
fire
where
he
would
have
expected
to
find
the
torment
the
disorder
the
violent
facial
distortion
of
the
great
accursed
he
beheld
sheer
impassiveness
he
asked
the
waiter
what
does
he
do
i
really
ca
say
he
a
rum
cove
he
always
quite
alone
he
never
talks
to
anybody
we
here
do
even
know
the
sound
of
his
voice
he
points
his
finger
at
the
dishes
on
the
bill
of
fare
which
he
wants
he
has
finished
in
twenty
minutes
then
he
pays
and
goes
and
he
comes
back
again
every
three
or
four
days
he
not
regular
it
he
it
can
not
be
any
one
else
said
lupin
to
himself
malreich
there
he
is
breathing
at
four
steps
from
me
there
are
the
hands
that
kill
there
is
the
brain
that
gloats
upon
the
smell
of
blood
there
is
the
monster
the
vampire
and
yet
was
it
possible
lupin
had
ended
by
looking
upon
malreich
as
so
fantastic
a
being
that
he
was
disconcerted
at
seeing
him
in
the
flesh
coming
going
moving
he
could
not
explain
to
himself
how
the
man
could
eat
bread
and
meat
like
other
men
drink
beer
like
any
one
else
this
man
whom
he
had
pictured
as
a
foul
beast
feeding
on
live
flesh
and
sucking
the
blood
of
his
victims
come
away
doudeville
what
the
matter
with
you
governor
you
look
quite
white
i
want
air
come
out
outside
he
drew
a
deep
breath
wiped
the
perspiration
from
his
forehead
and
muttered
that
better
i
was
stifling
and
mastering
himself
he
added
now
we
must
play
our
game
cautiously
and
not
lose
sight
of
his
tracks
had
we
better
separate
governor
our
man
saw
us
together
he
will
take
less
notice
of
us
singly
did
he
see
us
said
lupin
pensively
he
seems
to
me
to
see
nothing
to
hear
nothing
and
to
look
at
nothing
what
a
bewildering
specimen
and
in
fact
ten
minutes
later
leon
massier
appeared
and
walked
away
without
even
looking
to
see
if
he
was
followed
he
had
lit
a
cigarette
and
smoked
with
one
of
his
hands
behind
his
back
strolling
along
like
a
saunterer
enjoying
the
sunshine
and
the
fresh
air
and
never
suspecting
that
his
movements
could
possibly
be
watched
he
passed
through
the
skirted
the
fortifications
went
out
again
through
the
porte
champerret
and
retraced
his
steps
along
the
route
de
la
revolte
would
he
enter
the
buildings
at
no
lupin
eagerly
hoped
that
he
would
for
that
would
have
been
a
certain
proof
of
his
complicity
with
the
altenheim
gang
but
the
man
turned
round
and
made
for
the
rue
delaizement
which
he
followed
until
he
passed
the
velodrome
buffalo
on
the
left
opposite
the
between
the
public
and
the
booths
that
line
the
rue
delaizement
stood
a
small
detached
villa
surrounded
by
a
scanty
garden
leon
massier
stopped
took
out
his
keys
opened
first
the
gate
of
the
garden
and
then
the
door
of
the
house
and
disappeared
lupin
crept
forward
cautiously
he
at
once
noticed
that
the
block
in
the
route
de
la
revolte
stretched
back
as
far
as
the
coming
still
nearer
he
saw
that
the
wall
was
very
high
and
that
a
rested
against
it
at
the
bottom
of
the
garden
the
position
of
the
buildings
was
such
as
to
give
him
the
certainty
that
his
stood
back
to
back
with
the
in
the
inner
yard
of
no
which
served
as
a
for
the
broker
leon
massier
therefore
occupied
a
house
adjoining
the
place
in
which
the
seven
members
of
the
altenheim
gang
held
their
meetings
consequently
leon
massier
was
in
point
of
fact
the
supreme
leader
who
commanded
that
gang
and
there
was
evidently
a
passage
between
the
two
through
which
he
communicated
with
his
followers
i
was
right
said
lupin
leon
massier
and
louis
de
malreich
are
one
and
the
same
man
the
situation
is
much
simpler
than
it
was
there
is
no
doubt
about
that
said
doudeville
and
everything
will
be
settled
in
a
few
days
that
is
to
say
i
shall
have
been
stabbed
in
the
throat
what
are
you
saying
governor
there
an
idea
pooh
who
knows
i
have
always
had
a
presentiment
that
that
monster
would
bring
me
thenceforth
it
became
a
matter
of
watching
malreich
life
in
such
a
way
that
none
of
his
movements
went
unobserved
this
life
was
of
the
oddest
if
one
could
believe
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
whom
doudeville
questioned
the
bloke
from
the
villa
as
they
called
him
had
been
living
there
for
a
few
months
only
he
saw
and
received
nobody
he
was
not
known
to
keep
a
servant
of
any
kind
and
the
windows
though
they
were
left
wide
open
even
at
night
always
remained
dark
and
were
never
lit
with
the
glow
of
a
lamp
or
candle
moreover
leon
massier
most
often
went
out
at
the
close
of
day
and
did
not
come
in
again
until
very
late
at
dawn
said
people
who
had
come
upon
him
at
sunrise
and
does
any
one
know
what
he
does
asked
lupin
of
his
companion
when
they
next
met
no
he
leads
an
absolutely
irregular
existence
he
sometimes
disappears
for
several
days
together
or
rather
he
remains
indoors
when
all
is
said
nobody
knows
anything
well
we
shall
know
and
that
soon
he
was
wrong
after
a
week
of
continuous
efforts
and
investigations
he
had
learnt
no
more
than
before
about
that
strange
individual
the
extraordinary
thing
that
constantly
happened
was
this
that
suddenly
while
lupin
was
following
him
the
man
who
was
ambling
with
short
steps
along
the
streets
without
ever
turning
round
or
ever
stopping
the
man
would
vanish
as
if
by
a
miracle
true
he
sometimes
went
through
houses
with
two
entrances
but
at
other
times
he
seemed
to
fade
away
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
like
a
ghost
and
lupin
was
left
behind
petrified
astounded
filled
with
rage
and
confusion
he
at
once
hurried
to
the
rue
delaizement
and
stood
on
guard
outside
the
villa
minutes
followed
upon
minutes
upon
a
part
of
the
night
slipped
away
then
suddenly
the
mysterious
man
hove
in
sight
what
could
he
have
been
doing
an
express
message
for
you
governor
said
doudeville
at
eight
one
evening
as
he
joined
him
in
the
rue
delaizement
lupin
opened
the
envelope
kesselbach
implored
him
to
come
to
her
aid
it
appeared
that
two
men
had
taken
up
their
stand
under
her
windows
at
night
and
one
of
them
had
said
what
luck
we
dazzled
them
completely
this
time
so
it
understood
we
shall
strike
the
blow
kesselbach
thereupon
went
downstairs
and
discovered
that
the
shutter
in
the
pantry
did
not
fasten
or
at
least
that
it
could
be
opened
from
the
outside
at
last
said
lupin
it
the
enemy
himself
who
offers
to
give
battle
that
a
good
thing
i
am
tired
of
marching
up
and
down
under
malreich
windows
is
he
there
at
this
moment
no
he
played
me
one
of
his
tricks
again
in
paris
just
as
i
was
about
to
play
him
one
of
mine
but
first
of
all
listen
to
me
doudeville
go
and
collect
ten
of
our
men
and
bring
them
to
the
rue
des
vignes
look
here
bring
marco
and
jérôme
the
messenger
i
have
given
them
a
holiday
since
the
business
at
the
palace
hotel
let
them
come
this
time
daddy
charolais
and
his
son
ought
to
be
mounting
guard
by
now
make
your
arrangements
with
them
and
at
eleven
come
and
join
me
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
des
vignes
and
the
rue
raynouard
from
there
we
will
watch
the
house
doudeville
went
away
lupin
waited
for
an
hour
longer
until
that
quiet
thoroughfare
the
rue
delaizement
was
quite
deserted
and
then
seeing
that
leon
massier
did
not
return
he
made
up
his
mind
and
went
up
to
the
villa
there
was
no
one
in
sight
he
took
a
run
and
jumped
on
the
stone
ledge
that
supported
the
railings
of
the
garden
a
few
minutes
later
he
was
inside
his
plan
was
to
force
the
door
of
the
house
and
search
the
rooms
in
order
to
find
the
emperor
letters
which
malreich
had
stolen
from
veldenz
but
he
thought
a
visit
to
the
of
more
immediate
importance
he
was
much
surprised
to
see
that
it
was
open
and
next
to
find
by
the
light
of
his
electric
lantern
that
it
was
absolutely
empty
and
that
there
was
no
door
in
the
back
wall
he
hunted
about
for
a
long
time
but
met
with
no
more
success
outside
however
he
saw
a
ladder
standing
against
the
and
obviously
serving
as
a
means
of
reaching
a
sort
of
loft
contrived
under
the
slate
roof
the
loft
was
blocked
with
old
trusses
of
straw
and
gardener
frames
or
rather
it
seemed
to
be
blocked
for
he
very
soon
discovered
a
gangway
that
took
him
to
the
wall
here
he
knocked
up
against
a
which
he
tried
to
move
failing
to
effect
his
purpose
he
examined
the
frame
more
closely
and
found
first
that
it
was
fixed
to
the
wall
and
secondly
that
one
of
the
panes
was
missing
he
passed
his
arm
through
and
encountered
space
he
cast
the
bright
light
of
the
lantern
through
the
aperture
and
saw
a
big
shed
a
larger
than
that
of
the
villa
and
filled
with
old
and
objects
of
every
kind
that
it
said
lupin
to
himself
this
window
has
been
contrived
in
the
broker
right
up
at
the
top
and
from
here
louis
de
malreich
sees
hears
and
watches
his
accomplices
without
being
seen
or
heard
by
them
i
now
understand
how
it
is
that
they
do
not
know
their
leader
having
found
out
what
he
wanted
he
put
out
his
light
and
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
when
a
door
opened
opposite
him
down
below
some
one
came
in
and
lit
a
lamp
he
recognized
the
broker
he
thereupon
resolved
to
stay
where
he
was
since
the
expedition
after
all
could
not
be
done
so
long
as
that
man
was
there
the
broker
took
two
revolvers
from
his
pocket
he
tested
the
triggers
and
changed
the
cartridges
whistling
a
tune
as
he
did
so
an
hour
elapsed
in
this
way
lupin
was
beginning
to
grow
restless
without
however
making
up
his
mind
to
go
more
minutes
passed
half
an
hour
an
hour
at
last
the
man
said
aloud
come
in
one
of
the
scoundrels
slipped
into
the
shed
and
one
after
the
other
a
third
arrived
and
a
fourth
we
are
all
here
said
the
broker
dieudonne
and
chubby
will
meet
us
down
there
come
we
no
time
to
lose
are
you
armed
to
the
teeth
that
all
right
it
be
hot
work
how
do
you
know
broker
i
seen
the
chief
when
i
say
that
i
seen
him
no
but
he
spoke
to
me
yes
said
one
of
the
men
in
the
dark
at
a
as
usual
ah
altenheim
ways
were
better
than
that
at
least
one
knew
what
one
was
doing
and
do
you
know
retorted
the
broker
we
breaking
in
at
the
kesselbach
woman
and
what
about
the
two
watchers
the
two
coves
whom
lupin
posted
there
that
their
there
seven
of
us
they
had
better
give
us
as
little
trouble
as
possible
what
about
the
kesselbach
gag
her
first
then
bind
her
and
bring
her
here
there
on
that
old
sofa
and
then
wait
for
orders
is
the
job
well
paid
the
kesselbach
jewels
to
begin
with
yes
if
it
comes
off
but
i
speaking
of
the
certainty
three
notes
apiece
beforehand
and
twice
as
much
again
afterwards
have
you
the
money
yes
that
all
right
you
can
say
what
you
like
but
as
far
as
paying
goes
there
no
one
to
equal
that
bloke
and
in
a
voice
so
low
that
lupin
could
hardly
hear
i
say
broker
if
we
obliged
to
use
the
knife
is
there
a
reward
the
same
as
usual
two
thousand
if
it
lupin
three
thousand
oh
if
we
could
only
get
him
one
after
the
other
they
left
the
lupin
heard
the
parting
words
this
is
the
plan
of
attack
we
divide
into
three
lots
a
whistle
and
every
one
runs
forward
lupin
hurriedly
left
his
went
down
the
ladder
ran
round
the
house
without
going
in
and
climbed
back
over
the
railings
the
broker
right
it
be
hot
work
ah
it
my
skin
after
a
reward
for
lupin
the
rascals
he
passed
through
the
and
jumped
into
a
taxi
rue
raynouard
he
stopped
the
cab
at
two
hundred
yards
from
the
rue
des
vignes
and
walked
to
the
corner
of
the
two
streets
to
his
great
surprise
doudeville
was
not
there
that
funny
said
lupin
it
past
twelve
this
business
looks
suspicious
to
me
he
waited
ten
minutes
twenty
minutes
at
twelve
nobody
had
arrived
further
delay
was
dangerous
after
all
if
doudeville
and
his
men
were
prevented
from
coming
charolais
his
son
and
he
lupin
himself
were
enough
to
repel
the
attack
without
counting
the
assistance
of
the
servants
he
therefore
went
ahead
but
he
caught
sight
of
two
men
who
tried
to
hide
in
the
shadow
of
a
corner
wall
hang
it
he
said
that
the
vanguard
of
the
gang
dieudonne
and
chubby
i
allowed
myself
to
be
like
a
fool
here
he
lost
more
time
should
he
go
straight
up
to
them
disable
them
and
then
climb
into
the
house
through
the
which
he
knew
to
be
unlocked
that
would
be
the
most
prudent
course
and
would
enable
him
moreover
to
take
kesselbach
away
at
once
and
to
remove
her
to
a
place
of
safety
yes
but
it
also
meant
the
failure
of
his
plan
it
meant
missing
this
glorious
opportunity
of
trapping
the
whole
gang
including
louis
de
malreich
himself
without
doubt
suddenly
a
whistle
sounded
from
somewhere
on
the
other
side
of
the
house
was
it
the
rest
of
the
gang
so
soon
and
was
an
offensive
movement
to
be
made
from
the
garden
but
at
the
preconcerted
signal
the
two
men
climbed
through
the
window
and
disappeared
from
view
lupin
scaled
the
balcony
at
a
bound
and
jumped
into
the
pantry
by
the
sound
of
their
footsteps
he
judged
that
the
assailants
had
gone
into
the
garden
and
the
sound
was
so
distinct
that
he
felt
easy
in
his
mind
charolais
and
his
son
could
not
fail
to
hear
the
noise
he
therefore
went
upstairs
kesselbach
bedroom
was
on
the
first
landing
he
walked
in
without
knocking
a
was
burning
in
the
room
and
he
saw
dolores
on
a
sofa
fainting
he
ran
up
to
her
lifted
her
and
in
a
voice
of
command
forcing
her
to
answer
listen
charolais
his
son
where
are
they
she
stammered
why
what
do
you
mean
they
gone
of
course
what
gone
you
sent
me
word
an
hour
ago
a
he
picked
up
a
piece
of
blue
paper
lying
beside
her
and
read
send
the
two
watchers
away
at
once
and
all
my
men
tell
them
to
meet
me
at
the
grand
hotel
have
no
fear
thunder
and
you
believed
it
but
your
servants
gone
he
went
up
to
the
window
outside
three
men
were
coming
from
the
other
end
of
the
garden
from
the
window
in
the
next
room
which
looked
out
on
the
street
he
saw
two
others
on
the
pavement
and
he
thought
of
dieudonne
of
chubby
of
louis
de
malreich
above
all
who
must
now
be
prowling
around
invisible
and
formidable
hang
it
he
muttered
i
half
believe
they
done
me
this
time
chapter
xiv
the
man
in
black
at
that
moment
arsène
lupin
felt
the
impression
the
certainty
that
he
had
been
drawn
into
an
ambush
by
means
which
he
had
not
the
time
to
perceive
but
of
which
he
guessed
the
prodigious
skill
and
address
everything
had
been
calculated
everything
ordained
the
dismissal
of
his
men
the
disappearance
or
treachery
of
the
servants
his
own
presence
in
kesselbach
house
clearly
the
whole
thing
had
succeeded
exactly
as
the
enemy
wished
thanks
to
circumstances
almost
miraculously
fortunate
for
after
all
he
might
have
arrived
before
the
false
message
had
sent
his
friends
away
but
then
there
would
have
been
a
battle
between
his
own
gang
and
the
altenheim
gang
and
lupin
remembering
malreich
conduct
the
murder
of
altenheim
the
poisoning
of
the
mad
girl
at
veldenz
lupin
asked
himself
whether
the
ambush
was
aimed
at
him
alone
or
whether
malreich
had
not
contemplated
the
possibility
of
a
general
scuffle
involving
the
killing
of
accomplices
who
had
by
this
time
become
irksome
to
him
it
was
an
intuition
rather
a
fleeting
idea
that
just
passed
through
his
mind
the
hour
was
one
for
action
he
must
defend
dolores
the
abduction
of
whom
was
in
all
likelihood
the
first
and
foremost
reason
of
the
attack
he
the
casement
window
on
the
street
and
levelled
his
revolver
a
shot
rousing
and
alarming
the
neighborhood
and
the
scoundrels
would
take
to
their
heels
well
no
he
muttered
no
it
shall
not
be
said
that
i
shirked
the
fight
the
opportunity
is
too
good
and
then
who
says
that
they
would
run
away
there
are
too
many
of
them
to
care
about
the
neighbors
he
returned
to
dolores
room
there
was
a
noise
downstairs
he
listened
and
finding
that
it
came
from
the
staircase
he
locked
the
door
dolores
was
crying
and
throwing
herself
about
the
sofa
he
implored
her
are
you
strong
enough
we
are
on
the
first
floor
i
could
help
you
down
we
can
lower
the
sheets
from
the
window
no
no
do
leave
me
i
am
frightened
i
have
the
strength
they
will
kill
me
oh
protect
me
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
the
next
room
and
bending
over
her
do
move
and
keep
calm
i
swear
to
you
that
not
one
of
those
men
shall
touch
you
as
long
as
i
am
alive
the
door
of
the
first
room
was
tried
dolores
clinging
to
him
with
all
her
might
cried
oh
there
they
are
there
they
are
they
will
kill
you
you
are
alone
eagerly
he
said
no
i
am
not
alone
you
are
here
you
are
here
beside
me
he
tried
to
release
himself
she
took
his
head
in
her
two
hands
looked
him
deep
in
the
eyes
and
whispered
where
are
you
going
what
are
you
going
to
do
no
you
must
not
die
i
wo
have
it
you
must
live
you
must
she
stammered
words
which
he
did
not
catch
and
which
she
seemed
to
stifle
between
her
lips
lest
he
should
hear
them
and
having
spent
all
her
energy
exhausted
she
fell
back
unconscious
he
leant
over
her
and
gazed
at
her
for
a
moment
softly
lightly
he
pressed
a
kiss
upon
her
hair
then
he
went
back
to
the
first
room
carefully
closed
the
door
between
the
two
and
switched
on
the
electric
light
one
second
my
lads
he
cried
you
seem
in
a
great
hurry
to
get
yourselves
smashed
to
pieces
do
you
know
that
lupin
here
i
make
you
dance
while
speaking
he
unfolded
a
screen
in
such
a
way
as
to
hide
the
sofa
on
which
kesselbach
had
been
lying
and
he
now
spread
dresses
and
coverings
over
it
the
door
was
on
the
point
of
giving
way
under
the
blows
of
the
men
outside
here
i
am
coming
are
you
ready
now
gentlemen
one
at
a
time
he
briskly
turned
the
key
and
drew
the
bolt
shouts
threats
a
roar
of
infuriated
animals
came
through
the
open
doorway
yet
none
of
them
dared
come
forward
before
rushing
at
lupin
they
hesitated
seized
with
alarm
with
fear
this
was
what
he
had
reckoned
on
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
full
in
the
light
with
outstretched
arm
he
held
between
his
fingers
a
sheaf
of
which
he
divided
counting
them
one
by
one
into
seven
equal
shares
and
he
calmly
said
three
thousand
francs
reward
for
each
of
you
if
lupin
is
sent
to
his
last
account
that
what
you
were
promised
is
it
here
double
the
money
he
laid
the
bundles
on
the
table
within
reach
of
the
scoundrels
the
broker
roared
humbug
he
trying
to
gain
time
shoot
him
down
he
raised
his
arm
his
companions
held
him
back
and
lupin
continued
of
course
this
need
not
affect
your
plan
of
campaign
you
came
here
first
to
kidnap
kesselbach
and
secondly
to
lay
hands
on
her
jewels
far
be
it
from
me
to
interfere
with
your
laudable
intentions
look
here
what
are
you
driving
at
growled
the
broker
listening
in
spite
of
himself
aha

beginning
to
interest

am
i
come
in
old
chap
come
in
all
of
you
there
a
draught
at
the
top
of
those
stairs
and
such
pretty
fellows
as
you
must
run
the
risk
of
catching
cold
what
are
we
afraid
why
i
all
by
myself
come
pull
yourselves
together
my
lambs
they
entered
the
room
puzzled
and
suspicious
shut
the
door
broker

shall
be
more
comfortable
thanks
old
man
oh
by
the
way

the
broker
grinned

jewels

myself
there
a
way
of
doing

but
i
know

so
i
making

the
broker
hesitated

jewels
share
the
jewels
a
few
bits
of
glass
and
brass
most
likely
you
fool
there
more
than
a
million
worth
the
men
quivered
under
the
impression
made
upon
them
very
well
said
the
broker
but
suppose
the
kesselbach
gets
away
she
in
the
next
room
is
she
no
she
in
here
lupin
for
a
moment
pulled
back
one
of
the
leaves
of
the
screen
revealing
the
heap
of
dresses
and
which
he
had
laid
out
on
the
sofa
she
here
fainting
but
i
sha
give
her

divided
still

do
care
if
i
am
alone
you
know
what
i
good
for
so
please
yourselves
the
men
consulted
with
one
another
and
the
broker
said
where
is
the
you
talking
of
under
the
fireplace
but
when
you
do
know
the
secret
you
must
first
lift
up
the
whole
chimneypiece
marble
and
all
in
a
lump
it
seems
it
no
easy
job
pooh
we
a
smart
lot
we
are
just
you
wait
and
see
in
five
minutes
he
gave
his
orders
and
his
pals
at
once
set
to
work
with
admirable
vigor
and
discipline
two
of
them
standing
on
chairs
tried
to
lift
the
mirror
the
four
others
attacked
the
fireplace
itself
the
broker
on
his
knees
kept
his
eyes
on
the
hearth
and
gave
the
word
of
command
cheerily
lads
altogether
if
you
please
look
out
one
two
ah
there
it
moving
standing
behind
them
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
lupin
watched
them
affectionately
and
at
the
same
time
revelled
with
all
his
pride
as
an
artist
and
master
in
this
striking
proof
of
his
authority
of
his
might
of
the
incredible
sway
which
he
wielded
over
others
how
could
those
scoundrels
for
a
second
accept
that
improbable
story
and
lose
all
sense
of
things
to
the
point
of
relinquishing
every
chance
of
the
fight
in
his
favor
he
took
from
his
pockets
two
great
massive
and
formidable
revolvers
and
calmly
choosing
the
first
two
men
whom
he
would
bring
down
and
the
two
who
would
fall
next
he
aimed
as
he
might
have
aimed
at
a
pair
of
targets
in
a
two
shots
together
and
two
more
loud
yells
of
pain
four
men
came
tumbling
down
one
after
the
other
like
dolls
at
a
cockshy
four
from
seven
leaves
three
said
lupin
shall
i
go
on
his
arms
remained
outstretched
levelled
at
the
broker
and
his
two
pals
you
swine
growled
the
broker
feeling
for
a
weapon
hands
up
cried
lupin
or
i
fire
that
it
now
you
two
take
away
his
toys
if
not
the
two
scoundrels
shaking
with
fear
caught
hold
of
their
leader
and
compelled
him
to
submit
bind
him
bind
him
confound
it
what
difference
does
it
make
to
you
once
i
gone
you
all
free
come
along
have
you
finished
the
wrists
first
with
your
belts
and
the
ankles
hurry
up
the
broker
beaten
and
disabled
made
no
further
resistance
while
his
pals
were
binding
him
lupin
stooped
over
them
and
dealt
them
two
terrific
blows
on
the
head
with
the
of
his
revolver
they
sank
down
in
a
heap
that
a
good
piece
of
work
he
said
taking
breath
pity
there
are
not
another
fifty
of
them
i
was
just
in
the
mood
and
all
so
easily
done
with
a
smile
on
one
face
what
do
you
think
of
it
broker
the
scoundrel
lay
cursing
lupin
said
cheer
up
old
man
console
yourself
with
the
thought
that
you
are
helping
in
a
good
action
the
rescue
of
kesselbach
she
will
thank
you
in
person
for
your
gallantry
he
went
to
the
door
of
the
second
room
and
opened
it
what
this
he
said
stopping
on
the
threshold
taken
aback
dumfounded
the
room
was
empty
he
went
to
the
window
saw
a
ladder
leaning
against
the
balcony
a
telescopic
steel
ladder
and
muttered
kidnapped
kidnapped
louis
de
malreich
oh
the
villain
he
reflected
for
a
minute
trying
to
master
his
anguish
of
mind
and
said
to
himself
that
after
all
as
kesselbach
seemed
to
be
in
no
immediate
danger
there
was
no
cause
for
alarm
but
he
was
seized
with
a
sudden
fit
of
rage
and
flew
at
the
seven
scoundrels
gave
a
kick
or
two
to
those
of
the
wounded
who
stirred
felt
for
his
and
put
them
back
in
his
pocket
then
gagged
the
men
mouths
and
tied
their
hands
with
anything
that
he
could
find
blankets
and
sheets
reduced
to
strips
and
lastly
laid
in
a
row
on
the
carpet
in
front
of
the
sofa
seven
bundles
of
humanity
packed
tight
together
and
tied
up
like
so
many
parcels
mummies
on
toast
he
chuckled
a
dainty
dish
for
those
who
like
that
sort
of
thing
you
pack
of
fools
how
does
this
suit

he
left
the
room
went
down
the
street
and
walked
until
he
came
to
his
taxi
he
sent
the
driver
in
search
of
another
and
brought
both
cabs
back
to
house
a
good
tip
paid
in
advance
avoided
all
tedious
explanations
with
the
help
of
the
two
men
he
carried
the
seven
prisoners
down
and
plumped
them
anyhow
on
one
another
knees
into
the
cabs
the
wounded
men
yelled
and
moaned
he
shut
the
doors
shouting
mind
your
hands

got
up
beside
the
driver
of
the
front
cab
where
to
asked
the
man
quai
des

the
the
motors
throbbed
the
drivers
started
the
gear
and
the
strange
procession
went
scooting
down
the
slopes
of
the
trocadero
in
the
streets
they
passed
a
few
men
carrying
long
poles
were
turning
out
the
there
were
stars
in
the
sky
a
cool
breeze
was
wafted
through
the
air
lupin
sang
aloud
the
place
de
la
concorde
the
louvre
in
the
distance
the
dark
bulk
of
notre
dame
he
turned
round
and
half
opened
the
door
having
a
good
time
mates

a
grand
night

the

they
were

over

quays
and
soon
they
arrived
at
the
palais
de
justice
and
the
door
of
the
wait
here
said
lupin
to
the
two
drivers
and
be
sure
you
look
after
your
seven
fares
he
crossed
the
outer
yard
and
went
down
the
passage
on
the
right
leading
to
the
rooms
of
the
central
office
he
found
the
night
inspectors

the
finest
quality

i
should
like
to

arsène
lupin
he
nimbly
tripped
the
chief
inspector
up
ran
to
the
rue
de
rivoli
jumped
into
a
passing
and
drove
to
the
porte
des
ternes
the
route
de
la
revolte
was
close
by
he
went
to
no
for
all
his
coolness
and
arsène
lupin
was
unable
to
control
his
excitement
would
he
find
dolores
kesselbach
had
louis
de
malreich
taken
her
either
to
his
own
place
or
to
the
broker
shed
lupin
had
taken
the
key
of
the
shed
from
the
broker
so
that
it
was
easy
for
him
after
ringing
and
walking
across
the
different
yards
to
open
the
door
and
enter
the
he
switched
on
his
lantern
and
took
his
bearings
a
little
to
the
right
was
the
free
space
in
which
he
had
seen
the
accomplices
hold
their
last
confabulation
on
the
sofa
mentioned
by
the
broker
he
saw
a
black
figure
dolores
lay
wrapped
in
blankets
and
gagged
he
helped
her
up
ah
it
you
it
you
she
stammered
they
have
touched
you
and
rising
and
pointing
to
the
back
of
the
shop
there
he
went
out
that
side
i
heard
him
i
am
sure
you
must
go
please
i
must
get
you
away
first
he
said
no
never
mind
me
go
after
him
i
entreat
you
strike
him
fear
this
time
instead
of
dejecting
her
seemed
to
be
giving
her
unwonted
strength
and
she
repeated
with
an
immense
longing
to
place
her
terrible
enemy
in
his
power
go
after
him
first
i
ca
go
on
living
like
this
you
must
save
me
from
him
i
ca
go
on
living
he
unfastened
her
bonds
laid
her
carefully
on
the
sofa
and
said
you
are
right
besides
you
have
nothing
to
fear
here
wait
for
me
i
shall
come
back
as
he
was
going
away
she
caught
hold
of
his
hand
but
you
yourself
well
if
that
man
it
was
as
though
she
dreaded
for
lupin
the
great
final
contest
to
which
she
was
exposing
him
and
as
though
at
the
last
moment
she
would
have
been
glad
to
hold
him
back
he
said
thank
you
have
no
fear
what
have
i
to
be
afraid
of
he
is
alone
and
leaving
her
he
went
to
the
back
of
the
shed
as
he
expected
he
found
a
ladder
standing
against
the
wall
which
brought
him
to
the
level
of
the
little
window
through
which
he
had
watched
the
scoundrels
hold
their
meeting
it
was
the
way
by
which
malreich
had
returned
to
his
house
in
the
rue
delaizement
he
therefore
took
the
same
road
just
as
he
had
done
a
few
hours
earlier
climbed
into
the
loft
of
the
other
and
down
into
the
garden
he
found
himself
at
the
back
of
the
villa
occupied
by
malreich
strange
to
say
he
did
not
doubt
for
a
moment
that
malreich
was
there
he
would
meet
him
inevitably
the
formidable
battle
which
they
were
waging
against
each
other
was
nearing
its
end
a
few
minutes
more
and
one
way
or
another
all
would
be
over
he
was
amazed
on
grasping
the
handle
of
a
door
to
find
that
the
handle
turned
and
the
door
opened
under
his
pressure
the
villa
was
not
even
locked
he
passed
through
a
kitchen
a
hall
and
up
a
staircase
and
he
walked
deliberately
without
seeking
to
deaden
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
on
the
landing
he
stopped
the
perspiration
streamed
from
his
forehead
and
his
temples
throbbed
under
the
rush
of
his
blood
nevertheless
he
remained
calm
master
of
himself
and
conscious
of
his
least
thoughts
he
laid
two
revolvers
on
a
stair
no
weapons
he
said
to
himself
my
hands
only
just
the
effort
of
my
two
hands
that
quite
enough
that
will
be
better
opposite
him
were
three
doors
he
chose
the
middle
one
turned
the
handle
and
encountered
no
obstacle
he
went
in
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
but
the
rays
of
the
night
entered
through
the
window
and
amid
the
darkness
he
saw
the
sheets
and
the
white
curtains
of
the
bed
and
somebody
was
standing
beside
it
he
savagely
cast
the
gleam
of
his
lantern
upon
that
form
malreich
the
pallid
face
of
malreich
his
dim
eyes
his
cadaverous
his
scraggy
neck
and
all
this
stood
motionless
opposite
him
at
five
steps
distance
and
he
could
not
have
said
whether
that
dull
face
that
expressed
the
least
terror
or
even
a
grain
of
anxiety
lupin
took
a
step
forward
and
a
second
and
a
third
the
man
did
not
move
did
he
see
did
he
understand
it
was
as
though
the
man
eyes
were
gazing
into
space
and
that
he
thought
himself
possessed
by
an
hallucination
rather
than
looking
upon
a
real
image
one
more
step
he
will
defend
himself
thought
lupin
he
is
bound
to
defend
himself
and
lupin
thrust
out
his
arms
the
man
did
not
make
a
movement
he
did
not
retreat
his
eyelids
did
not
blink
the
contact
took
place
and
it
was
lupin
scared
and
bewildered
who
lost
his
head
he
knocked
the
man
back
upon
his
bed
stretched
him
at
full
length
rolled
him
in
the
sheets
bound
him
in
the
blankets
and
held
him
under
his
knee
like
a
prey
whereas
the
man
had
not
made
the
slightest
movement
of
resistance
ah
shouted
lupin
drunk
with
delight
and
satisfied
hatred
at
last
i
have
crushed
you
you
odious
brute
at
last
i
am
the
master
he
heard
a
noise
outside
in
the
rue
delaizement
men
knocking
at
the
gate
he
ran
to
the
window
and
cried
is
that
you
weber
already
well
done
you
are
a
model
servant
break
down
the
gate
old
chap
and
come
up
here
delighted
to
see
you
in
a
few
minutes
he
searched
his
prisoner
clothes
got
hold
of
his
cleared
the
papers
out
of
the
drawers
of
the
desk
and
the
davenport
flung
them
on
the
table
and
went
through
them
he
gave
a
shout
of
joy
the
bundle
of
letters
was
there
the
famous
bundle
of
letters
which
he
had
promised
to
restore
to
the
emperor
he
put
back
the
papers
in
their
place
and
went
to
the
window
it
all
finished
weber

can
come
in

murderer
in
his
bed
all
ready
tied
up

and
lupin
tearing
down
the
stairs
ran
to
the
and
went
back
to
dolores
kesselbach
while
weber
was
breaking
into
the
villa
he
had
arrested
altenheim
seven
companions
and
he
had
delivered
to
justice
the
mysterious
leader
of
the
gang
the
infamous
monster
louis
de
malreich
a
young
man
sat
writing
at
a
table
on
a
wide
wooden
balcony
from
time
to
time
he
raised
his
head
and
cast
a
vague
glance
toward
the
horizon
of
hills
where
the
trees
stripped
by
the
autumn
were
shedding
their
last
leaves
over
the
red
roofs
of
the
villas
and
the
lawns
of
the
gardens
then
he
went
on
writing
presently
he
took
up
his
paper
and
read
aloud

to

as
though
shivering
with
fever
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
has
the

yes
my
dear
pierre

the
hour
has
come
for
you
to
give
up
or
rather
to
interrupt
the
slack
poet
life
which
you
have
been
leading
for
months
at
the
feet
of
geneviève
ernemont
and
kesselbach
and
to
perform
the
part
which
i
have
allotted
to
you
in
my
play
oh
a
fine
play
i
assure
you
thoroughly
according
to
all
the
canons

comic

and
gnashing

we
have
reached

the
grand

at

and
you
pierre

are
the
hero

for
you
the
young

rose
from
his
seat
and
suppose
i
refuse

yes
suppose
i
refuse
after
all
what
obliges
me
to
submit
to
your
will
what
obliges
me
to
accept
a
part
which
i
do
not
know
but
which
i
loathe
in
advance
and
feel
ashamed
of
idiot
repeated
lupin
and
forcing
pierre
leduc
back
into
his
chair
he
sat
down
beside
him
and
in
the
gentlest
of
voices
you
quite
forget
my
dear
young
man
that
you
are
not
pierre
leduc
but
gérard
baupré
that
you
bear
the
beautiful
name
of
pierre
leduc
is
due
to
the
fact
that
you
gérard
baupré
killed
pierre
leduc
and
robbed
him
of
his
individuality
the
young
man
bounded
with
indignation
you
are
mad
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
you
conceived
the
whole
plot
yes
i
know
that
of
course
but
the
law
does
know
it
and
what
will
the
law
say
when
i
come
forward
with
proof
that
the
real
pierre
leduc
died
a
violent
death
and
that
you
have
taken
his
place
the
young
man
overwhelmed
with
consternation
stammered
no
one
will
believe
you
why
should
i
have
done
that
with
what
object
idiot
the
object
is
so
that
weber
himself
could
have
perceived
it
you
lie
when
you
say
that
you
will
not
accept
a
part
which
you
do
not
know
you
know
your
part
quite
well
it
is
the
part
which
pierre
leduc
would
have
played
were
he
not
dead
but
pierre
leduc
to
me
to
everybody
was
only
a
name
who
was

who
am

what
difference
can
that
make

you

want
to
know

want
to
know

i
am
doing
and
if
you
know
will
you
go
straight
ahead
yes
if
the
object
of
which
you
speak
is
worth
it
if
it
were

you
think
i
would
take
all
this
trouble
who
am
i
whatever
my
destiny

may
be

i
shall
prove
worthy

lupin
took
off
his
hat
bowed
and
said
hermann
of
prince
of
berncastel
elector
of
treves
and
lord
of
all
sorts
of
places
three
days
later
arsène
lupin
took
kesselbach
away
in
a
in
the
direction
of
the
frontier
the
journey
was
accomplished
in
silence
lupin
remembered
with
emotion
dolores
terrified
conduct
and
the
words
which
she
spoke
in
the
house
in
the
rue
des
vignes
when
he
was
about
to
defend
her
against
altenheim
accomplices
and
she
must
have
remembered
also
for
she
remained
embarrassed
and
evidently
perturbed
in
his
presence
in
the
evening
they
reached
a
small
castle
all
covered
with
creepers
and
flowers
roofed
with
an
enormous
slate
cap
and
standing
in
a
large
garden
full
of
ancestral
trees
here
kesselbach
found
geneviève
already
installed
after
a
visit
to
the
neighboring
town
where
she
had
engaged
a
staff
of
servants

lupin
you
are

castle
you
will
be
quite
safe
here
while
waiting
the
outcome
of
these
events
i
have
written
to
pierre
leduc
and
he
will
be
your
guest
from
he
started
off
again
at
once
drove
to
veldenz
and
handed
over
to
count
von

the
famous
letters
which
he
had
recaptured

know
my
conditions
my
dear
waldemar
said
lupin
the
first
and
most
important
thing
is
to
restore
the

to
reinstate
the

shall
open
negotiations
with
the
council
of

according
to
my
information
it
will
not
be
a
difficult
matter
but
this
hermann
his
royal
highness
is
at
present
staying
at
bruggen
castle
under
the
name
of
pierre
leduc
i
will
supply
all
the
necessary
proofs
of
his
identity
that
same
evening
lupin
took
the
road
back
to
paris
with
the
intention
of
actively
hurrying
on
the
trial
of
malreich
and
the
seven
scoundrels
it
would
be
wearisome
to
recapitulate
the
story
of
the
case
the
facts
down
to
the
smallest
details
are
in
the
memory
of
one
and
all
it
was
one
of
those
sensational
events
which
still
form
a
subject
of
conversation
and
discussion
among
the
laborers
in
the
remotest
villages
but
what
i
wish
to
recall
is
the
enormous
part
played
by
lupin
in
the
conduct
of
the
case
and
in
the
incidents
appertaining
to
the
preliminary
inquiry
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
was
he
who
managed
the
inquiry
from
the
very
start
he
took
the
place
of
the
authorities
ordering
directing
the
measures
to
be
taken
prescribing
the
questions
to
be
put
to
the
prisoners
assuming
the
responsibility
for
everything
we
can
all
remember
the
universal
amazement
when
morning
after
morning
we
read
in
the
papers
those
letters
so
irresistible
in
their
masterly
logic
signed
by
turns

arsène
lupin
of
arsène
lupin
he
flung
himself
into
the
business
with
a
spirit
an
ardor
a
violence
even
that
was
astonishing
in
one
usually
so
full
of
chaff
and
when
all
was
said
so
naturally
disposed
by
temperament
to
display
a
certain
professional
indulgence
no
this
time
he
was
prompted
by
hatred
he
hated
louis
de
malreich
that
bloodthirsty
scoundrel
that
foul
brute
of
whom
he
had
always
been
afraid
and
who
even
beaten
even
in
prison
still
gave
him
that
sensation
of
dread
and
repugnance
which
one
feels
at
the
sight
of
a
reptile
besides
had
not
malreich
had
the
audacity
to
persecute
dolores
he
has
played
and
lost
said
lupin
he
shall
pay
for
it
with
his
head
that
was
what
he
wanted
for
his
terrible
enemy
the
scaffold
the
bleak
dull
morning
when
the
blade
of
the
guillotine
slides
down
and
kills
it
was
a
strange
prisoner
whom
the
questioned
for
months
on
end
between
the
four
walls
of
his
room
a
strange
figure
that
bony
man
with
the
skeleton
face
and
the
lifeless
eyes
he
seemed
quite
out
of
himself
his
thoughts
were
not
there
but
elsewhere
and
he
cared
so
little
about
answering
my
name
is
leon
massier
that
was
the
one
sentence
to
which
he
confined
himself
and
lupin
retorted
you
lie
leon
massier
born
at
perigueux
left
fatherless
at
the
age
of
ten
died
seven
years
ago
you
took
his
papers
but
you
forgot
his

it

the

surviving
descendant
of
a
small
french
noble
who
settled
in

in

eighteenth
century

the
three
certificates
apart
from
the
question
of
his
identity
malreich
crushed
no
doubt
by
the
accumulation
of
proofs
brought
up
against
him
did
not
defend
himself
what
could
he
say
they
had
forty
notes
written
in
his
own
hand
a
comparison
of
the
handwritings
established
the
fact
written
in
his
own
hand
to
the
gang
of
his
accomplices
forty
notes
which
he
had
omitted
to
tear
up
after
taking
them
back
and
all
these
notes
were
orders
relating
to
the
kesselbach
case
the
capture
of
lenormand
and
gourel
the
pursuit
of
old
steinweg
the
construction
of
the
underground
passages
at
garches
and
so
on
what
possibility
was
there
of
a
denial
one
rather
odd
thing
baffled
the
law
officers
the
seven
scoundrels
when
confronted
with
their
leader
all
declared
that
they
did
not
know
him
because
they
had
never
seen
him
they
received
his
instructions
either
by
telephone
or
else
in
the
dark
by
means
of
those
same
little
notes
which
malreich
slipped
into
their
hands
without
a
word
but
for
the
rest
was
not
the
existence
of
the
communication
between
the
villa
in
the
rue
delaizement
and
the
broker
shed
an
ample
proof
of
complicity
from
that
spot
malreich
saw
and
heard
from
that
spot
the
leader
watched
his
men
discrepancies
apparently
irreconcilable
facts
lupin
explained
them
all
away
in
a
celebrated
article
published
on
the
morning
of
the
trial
he
took
up
the
case
from
the
start
revealed
what
lay
beneath
it
unravelled
its
web
showed
malreich
unknown
to
all
living
in
the
room
of
his
brother
the
sham
major
parbury
passing
unseen
along
the
passages
of
the
palace
hotel
and
murdering
kesselbach
murdering
beudot
the
murdering
chapman
the
secretary
the
trial
lingers
in
the
memory
it
was
both
terrifying
and
gloomy
terrifying
because
of
the
atmosphere
of
anguish
that
hung
over
the
crowd
of
onlookers
and
the
recollection
of
crime
and
blood
that
obsessed
their
minds
gloomy
heavy
darksome
stifling
because
of
the
tremendous
silence
observed
by
the
prisoner
not
a
protest
not
a
movement
not
a
word
a
face
of
wax
that
neither
saw
nor
heard
an
awful
vision
of
impassive
calmness
the
people
in
court
shuddered
their
distraught
imaginations
conjured
up
a
sort
of
supernatural
being
rather
than
a
man
a
sort
of
genie
out
of
the
arabian
nights
one
of
those
hindu
gods
who
symbolize
all
that
is
ferocious
cruel
sanguinary
and
pernicious
as
for
the
other
scoundrels
the
people
did
not
even
look
at
them
treated
them
as
insignificant
supers
overshadowed
by
that
stupendous
leader
the
most
sensational
evidence
was
that
given
by
kesselbach
to
the
general
astonishment
and
to
lupin
own
surprise
dolores
who
had
answered
none
of
the
magistrate
summonses
and
who
had
retired
to
an
unknown
spot
dolores
appeared
a
widow
to
give
damning
evidence
against
her
husband
murderer
she
gazed
at
him
for
many
seconds
and
then
said
simply
that
is
the
man
who
entered
my
house
in
the
rue
des
vignes
who
carried
me
off
and
who
locked
me
up
in
the
broker
shed
i
recognize
him
on
your
oath
i
swear
it
before
god
and
man
two
days
later
louis
de
malreich
leon
massier
was
sentenced
to
death
and
his
overpowering
personality
may
be
said
to
have
absorbed
that
of
his
accomplices
to
such
an
extent
that
they
received
the
benefit
of
extenuating
circumstances
louis
de
malreich
have
you
nothing
to
say
asked
the
presiding
judge
he
made
no
reply
one
question
alone
remained
undecided
in
lupin
eyes
why
had
malreich
committed
all
those
crimes
what
did
he
want
what
was
his
object
lupin
was
soon
to
understand
and
the
day
was
not
far
off
when
gasping
with
horror
struck
mortally
smitten
with
despair
he
would
know
the
awful
truth
for
the
moment
although
the
thought
of
it
constantly
hovered
over
his
mind
he
ceased
to
occupy
himself
with
the
malreich
case
resolved
to
get
a
new
skin
as
he
put
it
reassured
on
the
other
hand
as
to
the
fate
of
kesselbach
and
geneviève
over
whose
peaceful
existence
he
watched
from
afar
and
lastly
kept
informed
by
jean
doudeville
whom
he
had
sent
to
veldenz
of
all
the
negotiations
that
were
being
pursued
between
the
court
of
berlin
and
the
regent
of
he
employed
all
his
time
in
winding
up
the
past
and
preparing
for
the
future
the
thought
of
the
different
life
which
he
wished
to
lead
under
the
eyes
of
kesselbach
filled
him
with
new
ambitions
and
unexpected
sentiments
in
which
the
image
of
dolores
played
a
part
without
his
being
able
to
tell
exactly
how
or
why
in
a
few
weeks
he
got
rid
of
all
the
proofs
that
could
have
compromised
him
sooner
or
later
all
the
traces
that
could
have
led
to
his
ruin
he
gave
each
of
his
old
companions
a
sum
of
money
sufficient
to
keep
them
from
want
for
the
rest
of
their
lives
and
said
to
them
saying
that
he
was
going
to
south
america
one
morning
after
a
night
of
careful
thought
and
a
deep
study
of
the
situation
he
cried
it
done
there
nothing
to
fear
now
the
old
lupin
is
dead
make
way
for
the
young
one
his
man
brought
him
a
telegram
from
germany
it
contained
the
news
for
which
he
had
been
waiting
the
council
of
regency
greatly
influenced
by
the
court
of
berlin
had
referred
the
question
to
the
electors
and
the
electors
greatly
influenced
by
the
council
of
regency
had
declared
their
unshaken
attachment
to
the
old
dynasty
of
the
veldenz
count
von
waldemar
was
deputed
together
with
three
delegates
selected
from
the
nobility
the
army
and
the
law
to
go
to
bruggen
castle
carefully
to
establish
the
identity
of
the
hermann
iv
and
to
make
all
the
arrangements
with
his
royal
highness
for
his
triumphal
entry
into
the
principality
of
his
fathers
which
was
to
take
place
in
the
course
of
the
following
month
this
time
i
pulled
it
off
said
lupin
to
himself
kesselbach
great
scheme
is
being
realized
all
that
remains
for
me
to
do
is
to
make
waldemar
swallow
pierre
leduc
and
that
is
child
play
the
banns
between
geneviève
and
pierre
shall
be
published
and
it
shall
be
the
affianced
bride
that
will
be
presented
to
waldemar
full
of
glee
he
started
in
his
motor
for
bruggen
castle
he
sang
in
the
car
he
whistled
he
chatted
to
his
chauffeur
octave
do
you
know
whom
you
have
the
honor
of
driving
the
master
of
the
world
yes
old
man
that
staggers
you
eh
just
so
but
the
truth
i
am
the
master
of
the
world
he
rubbed
his
hands
and
went
on
soliloquizing
all
the
same
it
was
a
long
job
it
a
year
since
the
fight
began
true
it
was
the
most
formidable
fight
i
ever
stood
to
win
or
lose
by
jupiter
what
a
war
of
giants
and
he
repeated
but
this
time
i
pulled
it
off
the
enemies
are
in
the
water
there
are
no
obstacles
left
between
the
goal
and
me
the
site
is
free
let
us
build
upon
it
i
have
the
materials
at
hand
i
have
the
workmen
let
us
build
lupin
and
let
the
palace
be
worthy
of
you
he
stopped
the
car
at
a
few
hundred
yards
from
the
castle
so
that
his
arrival
might
create
as
little
fuss
as
possible
and
said
to
octave
wait
here
for
twenty
minutes
until
four
and
then
drive
in
take
my
bags
to
the
little
chalet
at
the
end
of
the
park
that
where
i
shall
sleep
at
the
first
turn
of
the
road
the
castle
appeared
in
sight
standing
at
the
end
of
a
dark
avenue
of
lime
trees
from
the
distance
he
saw
geneviève
passing
on
the
terrace
his
heart
was
softly
stirred
geneviève
geneviève
he
said
fondly
geneviève
the
vow
which
i
made
to
the
dying
mother
is
being
fulfilled
as
well
geneviève
a
and
i
in
the
shade
watching
over
her
happiness
and
pursuing
the
great
schemes
of
arsène
lupin
he
burst
out
laughing
sprang
behind
a
cluster
of
trees
that
stood
to
the
left
of
the
avenue
and
slipped
along
the
thick
shrubberies
in
this
way
he
reached
the
castle
without
the
possibility
of
his
being
seen
from
the
windows
of
the
or
the
principal
bedrooms
he
wanted
to
see
dolores
before
she
saw
him
and
pronounced
her
name
several
times
as
he
had
pronounced
geneviève
but
with
an
emotion
that
surprised
himself
dolores
dolores
he
stole
along
the
passages
and
reached
the
from
this
room
through
a
glass
panel
he
could
see
half
the
he
drew
nearer
dolores
was
lying
on
a
couch
and
pierre
leduc
on
his
knees
before
her
was
gazing
at
her
with
eyes
of
ecstasy
chapter
xv
the
map
of
europe
pierre
leduc
loved
dolores
lupin
felt
a
keen
penetrating
pain
in
the
depths
of
his
being
as
though
he
had
been
wounded
in
the
very
source
of
life
a
pain
so
great
that
for
the
first
time
he
had
a
clear
perception
of
what
dolores
had
gradually
unknown
to
himself
become
to
him
pierre
leduc
loved
dolores
and
he
was
looking
at
her
as
a
man
looks
at
the
woman
he
loves
lupin
felt
a
murderous
instinct
rise
up
within
him
blindly
and
furiously
that
look
that
look
of
love
cast
upon
dolores
maddened
him
he
received
an
impression
of
the
great
silence
that
enveloped
dolores
and
pierre
leduc
and
in
silence
in
the
stillness
of
their
attitude
there
was
nothing
living
but
that
look
of
love
that
dumb
and
sensuous
hymn
in
which
the
eyes
told
all
the
passion
all
the
desire
all
the
transport
all
the
yearning
that
one
being
can
feel
for
another
and
he
saw
kesselbach
also
dolores
eyes
were
invisible
under
their
lowered
lids
the
silky
eyelids
with
the
long
black
lashes
but
how
she
seemed
to
feel
that
look
of
love
which
sought
for
hers
how
she
quivered
under
that
impalpable
caress
she
loves
him
she
loves
him
thought
lupin
burning
with
jealousy
and
when
pierre
made
a
movement
oh
the
villain
if
he
dares
to
touch
her
i
will
kill
him
then
realizing
the
disorder
of
his
reason
and
striving
to
combat
it
he
said
to
himself
what
a
fool
i
am
what
you
lupin
letting
your
self
go
like
this
look
here
it
only
natural
that
she
should
love
him
yes
of
course
you
expected
her
to
show
a
certain
emotion
at
your
arrival
a
certain
agitation
you
silly
idiot
you
only
a
thief
a
robber
whereas
he
is
a
prince
and
young
pierre
had
not
stirred
further
but
his
lips
moved
and
it
seemed
as
though
dolores
were
waking
softly
slowly
she
raised
her
lids
turned
her
head
a
little
and
her
eyes
met
the
young
man
eyes
with
the
look
that
offers
itself
and
surrenders
itself
and
is
more
intense
than
the
most
intense
of
kisses
what
followed
came
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
like
a
in
three
bounds
lupin
rushed
into
the
sprang
upon
the
young
man
flung
him
to
the
ground
and
with
one
hand
on
his
rival
chest
beside
himself
with
anger
turning
to
kesselbach
he
cried
but
do
you
know
has
he
told
you
the
cheat
and
you
love
him
you
love
that
does
he
look
like
a
oh
what
a
joke
he
grinned
and
chuckled
like
a
madman
while
dolores
gazed
at
him
in
stupefaction
he
a
hermann
of
a
reigning
sovereign
elector
of
treves
but
it
enough
to
make
one
die
of
laughing
he
why
his
name
is

baupré
the
lowest
of

a
beggar
whom
i
picked
up
in
the
gutter
a
but

i
who
made
him
a
ha
ha
ha
what
a
joke
if
you
had
seen
him
cut
his
little
finger
he
fainted
three
times
the
milksop
ah
you
allow
yourself
to
lift
your
eyes
to
ladies
and
to
rebel
against
the
master
wait
a
bit
of
i
show
you
he
took
him
in
his
arms
like
a
bundle
swung
him
to
and
fro
for
a
moment
and
pitched
him
through
the
open
window
mind
the
rose
trees
there
are
thorns
when
he
turned
round
dolores
was
close
to
him
and
looking
at
him
with
eyes
which
he
had
never
seen
in
her
before
the
eyes
of
a
woman
who
hates
and
who
is
incensed
with
rage
could
this
possibly
be
dolores
the
weak
ailing
dolores
she
stammered
what
are
you
doing
how
dare
you
and
he
then
true
lied
to
me
lied
to
you
cried
lupin
grasping
the
humiliation
which
she
had
suffered
as
a
woman
lied
to
you
he
a
a
puppet
all
a
puppet
of
which
i
pulled
the
string
an
instrument
which
i
tuned
to
play
upon
as
i
chose
oh
the
fool
the
fool
overcome
with
renewed
rage
he
stamped
his
foot
and
shook
his
fist
at
the
open
window
and
he
began
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
flinging
out
phrases
in
which
all
the
violence
of
his
secret
thought
burst
forth
the
fool
then
he
did
see
what
i
expected
of
him
he
did
not
suspect
the
greatness
of
the
part
he
was
to
play
oh
i
shall
have
to
drive
it
into
his
noddle
by
force
i
see
lift
up
your
head
you
idiot
you
shall
be
by
the
grace
of
lupin
and
a
reigning
sovereign
with
a
civil
list
and
subjects
to
fleece
and
a
palace
which
charlemagne
shall
rebuild
for
you
and
a
master
that
shall
be
i
lupin
do
you
understand
you
numskull
lift
up
your
head
dash
it
higher
than
that
look
up
at
the
sky
remember
that
a
zweibrucken
was
hanged
for
before
the
hohenzollerns
were
ever
heard
of
and
you
are
a
zweibrucken
by
jove
no
less
and
i
am
here
i
i
lupin
and
you
shall
be
i
tell
you
a
very
well
but
a
all
the
same
quickened
with
my
breath
and
glowing
with
my
ardor
a
puppet
very
well
but
a
puppet
that
shall
speak
words
and
make
movements
and
perform
wishes
and
realize
dreams
yes
my
dreams
he
stood
motionless
as
though
dazzled
by
the
glory
of
his
conception
then
he
went
up
to
dolores
and
sinking
his
voice
with
a
sort
of
mystic
exaltation
he
said
on
my
left
on
my
right
baden

bavaria
south
germany
all
those
disconnected
discontented
states
crushed
under
the
heel
of
the
prussian
charlemagne
but
restless
and
ready
to
throw
off
the
yoke
at
any
moment
do
you
understand
all
that
a
man
like
myself
can
do
in
the
midst
of
that
all
the
aspirations
that
he
can
kindle
all
the
hatred
that
he
can
produce
all
the
angry
rebellion
that
he
can
inspire
in
a
still
lower
voice
he
repeated
and
on
my
left
do
you
fully
understand
dreams
not
at
all
it
is
the
reality
of
the
day
after
of
yes
i
wish
it
i
wish
it
oh
all
that
i
wish
and
all
that
i
mean
to
do
is
unprecedented
only
think
at
two
steps
from
the
alsatian
frontier
in
the
heart
of
german
territory
close
to
the
old
rhine
a
little
intrigue
a
little
genius
will
be
enough
to
change
the
surface
of
the
earth
genius
i
have
and
to
spare
and
i
shall
be
the
master
i
shall
be
the
man
who
directs
the
other
the
puppet
can
have
the
title
and
the
honors
i
shall
have
the
power
i
shall
remain
in
the
background
no
office
i
will
not
be
a
minister
nor
even
a
chamberlain
nothing
i
shall
be
one
of
the
servants
in
the
palace
the
gardener
perhaps
yes
the
gardener
oh
what
a
tremendous
life
to
grow
flowers
and
alter
the
map
of
europe
she
looked
at
him
greedily
dominated
swayed
by
the
strength
of
that
man
and
her
eyes
expressed
an
admiration
which
she
did
not
seek
to
conceal
he
put
his
hands
on
dolores
shoulders
and
said
that
is
my
dream
great
as
it
is
it
will
be
surpassed
by
the
facts
that
i
swear
to
you
the
kaiser
has
already
seen
what
i
am
good
for
one
day
he
will
find
me
installed
in
front
of
him
face
to
face
i
hold
all
the
trumps
valenglay
will
act
at
my
bidding
england
also
the
game
is
played
and
won
that
is
my
dream
there
is
another
one
he
stopped
suddenly
dolores
did
not
take
her
eyes
from
him
and
an
infinite
emotion
changed
every
feature
of
her
face
a
vast
joy
penetrated
him
as
he
once
more
felt
and
clearly
felt
that
woman
confusion
in
his
presence
he
no
longer
had
the
sense
of
being
to
her
what
he
was
a
thief
a
robber
he
was
a
man
a
man
who
loved
and
whose
love
roused
unspoken
feelings
in
the
depths
of
a
friendly
soul
then
he
said
no
more
but
he
lavished
upon
her
unuttered
every
known
word
of
love
and
admiration
and
he
thought
of
the
life
which
he
might
lead
somewhere
not
far
from
veldenz
unknown
and
a
long
silence
united
them
then
she
rose
and
said
softly
go
away
i
entreat
you
to
go
pierre
shall
marry
geneviève
i
promise
you
that
but
it
is
better
that
you
should
go
that
you
should
not
be
here
go
pierre
shall
marry
geneviève
he
waited
for
a
moment
perhaps
he
would
rather
have
had
more
definite
words
but
he
dared
not
ask
for
anything
and
he
withdrew
dazed
intoxicated
and
happy
to
obey
to
subject
his
destiny
to
hers
on
his
way
to
the
door
he
came
upon
a
low
chair
which
he
had
to
move
but
his
foot
knocked
against
something
he
looked
down
it
was
a
little
in
ebony
with
a
gold
monogram
suddenly
he
started
and
snatched
up
the
mirror
the
monogram
consisted
of
two
letters
interlaced
an
l
and
an
an
l
and
an
m
louis
de
malreich
he
said
to
himself
with
a
shudder
he
turned
to
dolores
where
does
this
mirror
come
from
whose
is
it
it
is
important
that
i
should
she
took
it
from
him
and
looked
at
it
i
do
know
i
never
saw
it
before
a
servant
perhaps
a
servant
no
doubt
he
said
but
it
is
very
odd
it
is
one
of
those
coincidences
at
that
moment
geneviève
entered
by
the
other
door
and
without
seeing
lupin
who
was
hidden
by
a
screen
at
once
exclaimed
why
there
your
glass
dolores
so
you
have
found
it
after
making
me
hunt
for
it
all
this
time
where
was
it
and
the
girl
went
away
saying
oh
well
i
very
glad
it
found
how
upset
you
were
i
will
go
and
tell
them
at
once
to
stop
looking
for
it
lupin
had
not
moved
he
was
confused
and
tried
in
vain
to
understand
why
had
dolores
not
spoken
the
truth
why
had
she
not
at
once
said
whose
the
mirror
was
an
idea
flashed
across
his
mind
and
he
asked
more
or
less
at
random
do
you
know
louis
de
malreich
yes
she
said
watching
him
as
though
striving
to
guess
the
thoughts
that
beset
him
he
rushed
toward
her
in
a
state
of
intense
excitement
you
know
him
who
was
he
who
is
he
who
is
he
and
why
did
you
not
tell
me
where
have
you
known
him
speak
answer
i
implore
you
no
she
said
but
you
must
you
must
think
louis
de
malreich
the
murderer
the
monster
why
did
you
not
tell
me
she
in
turn
placed
her
hands
on
lupin
shoulders
and
in
a
firm
voice
declared
listen
you
must
never
ask
me
because
i
shall
never
tell
it
is
a
secret
which
i
shall
take
with
me
to
the
grave
come
what
may
no
one
will
ever
know
no
one
in
the
wide
world
i
swear
it
he
stood
before
her
for
some
minutes
anxiously
with
a
confused
brain
he
remembered
steinweg
silence
and
the
old
man
terror
when
lupin
asked
him
to
reveal
the
terrible
secret
dolores
also
knew
and
she
also
refused
to
speak
he
went
out
without
a
word
the
open
air
the
sense
of
space
did
him
good
he
passed
out
through
the
and
wandered
long
over
the
country
and
he
soliloquized
aloud
what
does
it
mean
what
is
happening
for
months
and
months
fighting
hard
and
acting
i
have
been
pulling
the
strings
of
all
the
characters
that
are
to
help
me
in
the
execution
of
my
plans
and
during
this
time
i
have
completely
forgotten
to
stoop
over
them
and
see
what
is
going
on
in
their
hearts
and
brains
i
do
not
know
pierre
leduc
i
do
not
know
geneviève
i
do
not
know
dolores
and
i
have
treated
them
as
so
many
whereas
they
are
live
persons
and
i
am
stumbling
over
obstacles
he
stamped
his
foot
and
cried
over
obstacles
that
do
not
exist
what
do
i
care
for
the
psychological
state
of
geneviève
of
pierre
i
will
study
that
later
at
veldenz
when
i
have
secured
their
happiness
but
dolores
she
knew
malreich
and
said
nothing
why
what
relation
united
them
was
she
afraid
of
him
is
she
afraid
that
he
will
escape
from
prison
and
come
to
revenge
himself
for
an
indiscretion
on
her
part
at
night
he
went
to
the
chalet
which
he
had
allotted
to
his
own
use
at
the
end
of
the
park
and
dined
in
a
very
bad
temper
storming
at
octave
who
waited
on
him
and
who
was
always
either
too
slow
or
too
fast
i
sick
of
it
leave
me
alone
you
doing
everything
wrong
and
this
coffee
it
not
fit
to
drink
he
pushed
back
his
cup
and
for
two
hours
walked
about
the
park
sifting
the
same
ideas
over
and
over
again
at
last
one
suggestion
took
definite
shape
within
his
mind
malreich
has
escaped
from
prison
he
is
terrifying
kesselbach
by
this
time
he
already
knows
the
story
of
the
mirror
from
her
lupin
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
he
coming
to
pull
my
leg
i
suppose
i
talking
nonsense
the
best
thing
i
can
do
is
to
go
to
bed
he
went
to
his
room
undressed
and
got
into
bed
he
fell
asleep
at
once
with
a
heavy
sleep
disturbed
by
nightmares
twice
he
woke
and
tried
to
light
his
candle
and
twice
fell
back
as
though
stunned
by
a
blow
nevertheless
he
heard
the
hours
strike
on
the
village
clock
or
rather
he
thought
that
he
heard
them
strike
for
he
was
plunged
in
a
sort
of
torpor
in
which
he
seemed
to
retain
all
his
wits
and
he
was
haunted
by
dreams
dreams
of
anguish
and
terror
he
plainly
heard
the
sound
of
his
window
opening
he
plainly
through
his
closed
eyelids
through
the
thick
darkness
a
form
come
toward
the
bed
and
the
form
bent
over
him
he
made
the
incredible
effort
needed
to
raise
his
eyelids
and
look
or
at
least
he
imagined
that
he
did
was
he
dreaming
was
he
awake
he
asked
himself
the
question
in
despair
a
further
sound
he
took
up
the
box
of
matches
by
his
bedside
let
have
a
light
on
it
he
said
with
a
great
sense
of
elation
he
struck
a
match
and
lit
the
candle
lupin
felt
the
perspiration
stream
over
his
skin
from
head
to
foot
while
his
heart
ceased
beating
stopped
with
terror
man
was
was
it
possible
no
no
and
yet
he
oh
the
fearsome
sight
the
man
the
monster
was
there
he
shall
not
he
shall
not
stammered
lupin
madly
the
man
the
monster
was
there
dressed
in
black
with
a
mask
on
his
face
and
with
his
felt
hat
pulled
down
over
his
fair
hair
oh
i
am
dreaming
i
am
dreaming
said
lupin
laughing
it
a
nightmare
exerting
all
his
strength
and
all
his
he
tried
to
make
a
movement
one
movement
to
drive
away
the
vision
he
could
not
and
suddenly
he
remembered
the
coffee
the
taste
of
it
similar
to
the
taste
of
the
coffee
which
he
had
drunk
at
veldenz
he
gave
a
cry
made
a
last
effort
and
fell
back
exhausted
but
in
his
delirium
he
felt
that
the
man
was
unfastening
the
top
button
of
his
and
baring
his
neck
felt
that
the
man
was
raising
his
arm
saw
that
the
hand
was
clutching
the
handle
of
a
dagger
a
little
steel
dagger
similar
to
that
which
had
struck
kesselbach
chapman
altenheim
and
so
many
others
a
few
hours
later
lupin
woke
up
shattered
with
fatigue
with
a
scorched
palate
he
lay
for
several
minutes
collecting
his
thoughts
and
suddenly
remembering
made
an
instinctive
defensive
movement
as
though
he
were
being
attacked
fool
that
i
am
he
cried
jumping
out
of
bed
it
was
a
nightmare
an
hallucination
it
only
needs
a
little
reflection
had
it
been
had
it
really
been
a
man
in
flesh
and
blood
who
lifted
his
hand
against
me
last
night
he
would
have
cut
my
throat
like
a
rabbit
hesitate
let
be
logical
why
should
he
spare
me
for
the
sake
of
my
good
looks
no
i
have
been
dreaming
that
all
he
began
to
whistle
and
dressed
himself
assuming
the
greatest
calmness
but
his
brain
never
ceased
working
and
his
eyes
sought
about
on
the
floor
on
the
not
a
trace
as
his
room
was
on
the
and
as
he
slept
with
his
window
open
it
was
evident
that
his
assailant
would
have
entered
that
way
well
he
discovered
nothing
and
nothing
either
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
outside
or
on
the
gravel
of
the
path
that
ran
round
the
chalet
still
still
he
repeated
between
his
teeth
he
called
octave
where
did
you
make
the
coffee
which
you
gave
me
last
night
at
the
castle
governor
like
the
rest
of
the
things
there
is
no
range
here
did
you
drink
any
of
it
no
did
you
throw
away
what
was
left
in
the
why
yes
governor
you
said
it
was
so
bad
you
only
took
a
few
mouthfuls
very
well
get
the
motor
ready
we
leaving
lupin
was
not
the
man
to
remain
in
doubt
he
wanted
to
have
a
decisive
explanation
with
dolores
but
for
this
he
must
first
clear
up
certain
points
that
seemed
to
him
obscure
and
see
jean
doudeville
who
had
sent
him
some
rather
curious
information
from
veldenz
he
drove
without
stopping
to
the
which
he
reached
at
two
he
had
an
interview
with
count
de
waldemar
whom
he
asked
upon
some
pretext
to
delay
the
journey
of
the
delegates
of
the
regency
to
bruggen
then
he
went
in
search
of
doudeville
in
a
tavern
at
veldenz
doudeville
took
him
to
another
tavern
where
he
introduced
him
to
a
little
gentleman
herr
stockli
a
clerk
in
the
department
of
births
deaths
and
marriages
they
had
a
long
conversation
they
went
out
together
and
all
three
passed
stealthily
through
the
offices
of
the
at
seven
lupin
dined
and
set
out
again
at
ten
he
arrived
at
bruggen
castle
and
asked
for
geneviève
so
that
she
might
take
him
to
kesselbach
room
he
was
told
that
mlle
ernemont
had
been
summoned
back
to
paris
by
a
telegram
from
her
grandmother
ah
he
said
could
i
see
mrs
kesselbach
kesselbach
went
straight
to
bed
after
dinner
she
is
sure
to
be
asleep
no
i
saw
a
light
in
her
boudoir
she
will
see
me
he
did
not
even
wait
for
kesselbach
to
send
out
an
answer
he
walked
into
the
boudoir
almost
upon
the
maid
heels
dismissed
her
and
said
to
dolores
i
have
to
speak
to
you
madame
on
an
urgent
matter
forgive
me
i
confess
that
my
behavior
must
seem
importunate
but
you
will
understand
i
am
sure
he
was
greatly
excited
and
did
not
seem
much
disposed
to
put
off
the
explanation
especially
as
before
entering
the
room
he
thought
he
heard
a
sound
yet
dolores
was
alone
and
lying
down
and
she
said
in
her
tired
voice
perhaps
we
might
he
did
not
answer
suddenly
struck
by
a
smell
that
surprised
him
in
that
boudoir
a
smell
of
tobacco
and
at
once
he
had
the
intuition
the
certainty
that
there
was
a
man
there
at
the
moment
when
he
himself
arrived
and
that
perhaps
the
man
was
there
still
hidden
somewhere
pierre
leduc
no
pierre
leduc
did
not
smoke
then
who
dolores
murmured
be
quick
please
yes
yes
but
first
would
it
be
possible
for
you
to
tell
me
he
interrupted
himself
what
was
the
use
of
asking
her
if
there
were
really
a
man
in
hiding
would
she
be
likely
to
tell
then
he
made
up
his
mind
and
trying
to
overcome
the
sort
of
timid
constraint
that
oppressed
him
at
the
sense
of
a
strange
presence
he
said
in
a
very
low
voice
so
that
dolores
alone
should
hear
listen
i
have
learnt
something
which
i
do
not
understand
and
which
perplexes
me
greatly
you
will
answer
me
will
you
not
dolores
he
spoke
her
name
with
great
gentleness
and
as
though
he
were
trying
to
master
her
by
the
note
of
love
and
affection
in
his
voice
what
have
you
learnt
she
asked
the
register
of
births
at
veldenz
contains
three
names
which
are
those
of
the
last
descendants
of
the
family
of
malreich
which
settled
in
germany
yes
you
have
told
me
all
that
you
remember
the
first
name
is
raoul
de
malreich
better
known
under
his
of
altenheim
the
scoundrel
the
swell
hooligan
now
dead
murdered
yes
next
comes
louis
de
malreich
the
monster
this
one
the
terrible
murderer
who
will
be
beheaded
in
a
few
days
from
now
yes
then
lastly
isilda
the
mad
daughter
yes
so
all
that
is
quite
positive
is
it
not
yes
well
said
lupin
leaning
over
her
more
closely
than
before
i
have
just
made
an
investigation
which
showed
to
me
that
the
second
of
the
three
christian
names
or
rather
a
part
of
the
line
on
which
it
is
written
has
at
some
time
or
other
been
subjected
to
erasure
the
line
is
written
over
in
a
new
hand
with
much
fresher
ink
but
the
writing
below
is
not
quite
effaced
so
that
so
that
asked
kesselbach
in
a
low
voice
so
that
with
a
good
lens
and
particularly
with
the
special
methods
which
i
have
at
my
disposal
i
was
able
to
revive
some
of
the
obliterated
syllables
and
without
any
possibility
of
a
mistake
in
all
certainty
to
reconstruct
the
old
writing
i
then
found
not
louis
de
malreich
but
oh
do
do
suddenly
shattered
by
the
strain
of
her
prolonged
effort
of
resistance
she
lay
bent
in
two
and
with
her
head
in
her
hands
her
shoulders
shaken
with
convulsive
sobs
she
wept
lupin
looked
for
long
seconds
at
this
weak
and
listless
creature
so
pitifully
helpless
and
he
would
have
liked
to
stop
to
cease
the
torturing
questions
which
he
was
inflicting
upon
her
but
was
it
not
to
save
her
that
he
was
acting
as
he
did
and
to
save
her
was
it
not
necessary
that
he
should
know
the
truth
however
painful
he
resumed
why
that
forgery
it
was
my
husband
she
stammered
it
was
my
husband
who
did
it
with
his
fortune
he
could
do
everything
and
he
bribed
a
junior
clerk
to
have
the
christian
name
of
the
second
child
altered
for
him
on
the
register
the
christian
name
and
the
sex
said
lupin
yes
she
said
then
he
continued
i
am
not
mistaken
the
original
christian
name
the
real
one
was
dolores
yes
but
why
did
your
husband
she
whispered
in
a
manner
while
the
tears
streamed
down
her
cheeks
do
you
understand
no
but
think
she
said
shuddering
i
was
the
sister
of
isilda
the
mad
woman
the
sister
of
altenheim
the
ruffian
my
husband
or
rather
my
affianced
husband
would
not
have
me
remain
that
he
loved
me
i
loved
him
too
and
i
consented
he
suppressed
dolores
de
malreich
on
the
register
he
bought
me
other
papers
another
personality
another
and
i
was
married
in
holland
under
another
maiden
name
as
dolores
amonti
lupin
reflected
for
a
moment
and
said
thoughtfully
yes
yes
i
understand
but
then
louis
de
malreich
does
not
exist
and
the
murderer
of
your
husband
the
murderer
of
your
brother
and
sister
does
not
bear
that
name
his
name
she
sprang
to
a
sitting
posture
and
eagerly
his
name
yes
that
is
his
name
yes
it
is
his
name
nevertheless
louis
de
malreich
remember
oh
do
not
try
to
find
out
it
is
the
terrible
secret
besides
what
does
it
matter
they
have
the
criminal
he
is
the
criminal
i
tell
you
he
is
did
he
defend
himself
when
i
accused
him
face
to
face
could
he
defend
himself
under
that
name
or
any
other
it
is
he
it
is
he
he
committed
the
murders
he
struck
the
blows
the
dagger
the
steel
dagger
oh
if
i
could
only
tell
all
i
know
louis
de
malreich
if
i
could
only
she
fell
back
on
the
sofa
in
a
fit
of
hysterical
sobbing
and
her
hand
clutched
lupin
and
he
heard
her
stammering
amid
inarticulate
words
protect
me
protect
me
you
alone
perhaps
oh
do
not
forsake
me
i
am
so
unhappy
oh
what
torture
what
torture
it
is
hell
with
his
free
hand
he
stroked
her
hair
and
forehead
with
infinite
gentleness
and
under
his
caress
she
gradually
relaxed
her
tense
nerves
and
became
calmer
and
quieter
then
he
looked
at
her
again
and
long
long
asked
himself
what
there
could
be
behind
that
fair
white
brow
what
secret
was
ravaging
that
mysterious
soul
she
also
was
afraid
but
of
whom
against
whom
was
she
imploring
him
to
protect
her
once
again
he
was
obsessed
by
the
image
of
the
man
in
black
by
that
louis
de
malreich
the
sinister
and
incomprehensible
enemy
whose
attacks
he
had
to
ward
off
without
knowing
whence
they
came
or
even
if
they
were
taking
place
he
was
in
prison
watched
day
and
night
tush
did
lupin
not
know
by
his
own
experience
that
there
are
beings
for
whom
prison
does
not
exist
and
who
throw
off
their
chains
at
the
given
moment
and
louis
de
malreich
was
one
of
those
yes
there
was
some
one
in
the
santé
prison
in
the
condemned
cell
but
it
might
be
an
accomplice
or
some
victim
of
malreich
while
malreich
himself
prowled
around
bruggen
castle
slipped
in
under
cover
of
the
darkness
like
an
invisible
spectre
made
his
way
into
the
chalet
in
the
park
and
at
night
raised
his
dagger
against
lupin
asleep
and
helpless
and
it
was
louis
de
malreich
who
terrorized
dolores
who
drove
her
mad
with
his
threats
who
held
her
by
some
dreadful
secret
and
forced
her
into
silence
and
submission
and
lupin
imagined
the
enemy
plan
to
throw
dolores
scared
and
trembling
into
pierre
leduc
arms
to
make
away
with
him
lupin
and
to
reign
in
his
place
over
there
with
the
power
and
dolores
millions
it
was
a
likely
supposition
a
certain
supposition
which
fitted
in
with
the
facts
and
provided
a
solution
of
all
the
problems
of
all
thought
lupin
yes
but
then
why
did
he
not
kill
me
last
night
in
the
chalet
he
had
but
to
wish
he
did
not
one
movement
and
i
was
dead
he
did
not
make
that
movement
why
dolores
opened
her
eyes
saw
him
and
smiled
with
a
pale
smile
leave
me
she
said
he
rose
with
some
hesitation
should
he
go
and
see
if
the
enemy
was
behind
the
curtain
or
hidden
behind
the
dresses
in
a
cupboard
she
repeated
gently
go
i
am
so
sleepy
he
went
away
but
outside
he
stopped
behind
some
trees
that
formed
a
dark
cluster
in
front
of
the
castle
he
saw
a
light
in
dolores
boudoir
then
the
light
passed
into
the
bedroom
in
a
few
minutes
all
was
darkness
he
waited
if
the
enemy
was
there
perhaps
he
would
come
out
of
the
castle
an
hour
elapsed
two
hours
not
a
sound
there
nothing
to
be
done
thought
lupin
either
he
is
burrowing
in
some
corner
of
the
castle
or
else
he
has
gone
out
by
a
door
which
i
can
not
see
from
here
unless
the
whole
thing
is
the
most
ridiculous
supposition
on
my
part
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
walked
back
to
the
chalet
as
he
approached
it
he
saw
at
some
distance
from
him
a
shadow
that
appeared
to
be
moving
away
he
did
not
stir
for
fear
of
giving
the
alarm
the
shadow
crossed
a
path
by
the
light
of
the
moon
he
seemed
to
recognize
the
black
figure
of
malreich
he
rushed
forward
the
shadow
fled
and
vanished
from
sight
come
he
said
it
shall
be
for
and
this
time
lupin
went
to
octave
his
chauffeur
room
woke
him
and
said
take
the
motor
and
go
to
paris
you
will
be
there
by
six
in
the
morning
see
jacques
doudeville
and
tell
him
two
things
first
to
give
me
news
of
the
man
under
sentence
of
death
and
secondly
as
soon
as
the
open
to
send
me
a
telegram
which
i
will
write
down
for
you
now
he
worded
the
telegram
on
a
scrap
of
paper
and
added
the
moment
you
have
done
that
come
back
but
this
way
along
the
wall
of
the
park
go
now
no
one
must
suspect
your
absence
lupin
went
to
his
own
room
pressed
the
spring
of
his
lantern
and
began
to
make
a
minute
inspection
it
as
i
thought
he
said
presently
some
one
came
here
while
i
was
watching
beneath
the
window
and
if
he
came
i
know
what
he
came
for
i
was
certainly
right
things
are
getting
warm
the
first
time
i
was
spared
this
time
i
may
be
sure
of
my
little
stab
for
prudence
sake
he
took
a
blanket
chose
a
lonely
spot
in
the
park
and
spent
the
night
under
the
stars
octave
was
back
by
ten
in
the
morning
it
all
right
governor
the
telegram
has
been
sent
good
and
is
louis
de
malreich
still
in
prison
yes
doudeville
passed
his
cell
at
the
santé
last
night
as
the
warder
was
coming
out
they
talked
together
malreich
is
just
the
same
it
appears
silent
as
the
grave
he
is
waiting
waiting
for
what
the
fatal
hour
of
course
they
are
saying
at
headquarters
that
the
execution
will
take
place
on
the
day
after
that
all
right
that
all
right
said
lupin
and
one
thing
is
quite
plain
he
has
not
escaped
he
ceased
to
understand
or
even
to
look
for
the
explanation
of
the
riddle
so
clearly
did
he
feel
that
the
whole
truth
would
soon
be
revealed
to
him
he
had
only
to
prepare
his
plan
for
the
enemy
to
fall
into
the
trap
or
for
me
to
fall
into
it
myself
he
thought
laughing
he
felt
very
gay
very
free
from
care
and
no
fight
had
ever
looked
more
promising
to
him
a
footman
came
from
the
castle
with
the
telegram
which
he
had
told
doudeville
to
send
him
and
which
the
postman
had
just
brought
he
opened
it
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
a
little
before
twelve
he
met
pierre
leduc
in
one
of
the
avenues
and
said
i
am
looking
for
you
things
are
serious
you
must
answer
me
frankly
since
you
have
been
at
the
castle
have
you
ever
seen
a
man
there
besides
the
two
german
servants
whom
i
sent
in
no
think
carefully
i
not
referring
to
a
casual
visitor
i
mean
a
man
who
hides
himself
a
man
whose
presence
you
might
have
discovered
or
less
than
that
whose
presence
you
might
have
suspected
from
some
clue
or
even
by
some
intuition
no
have
you
yes
some
one
is
hiding
here
some
one
is
prowling
about
where
and
who
is
it
and
what
is
his
object
i
do
know
but
i
shall
know
i
already
have
a
suspicion
do
you
on
your
side
keep
your
eyes
open
and
watch
and
above
all
not
a
word
to
kesselbach
it
is
no
use
alarming
her
he
went
away
pierre
leduc
taken
aback
and
upset
went
back
to
the
castle
on
his
way
he
saw
a
piece
of
blue
paper
on
the
edge
of
the
lawn
he
picked
it
up
it
was
a
telegram
not
crumpled
like
a
piece
of
paper
that
had
been
thrown
away
but
carefully
folded
obviously
lost
it
was
addressed
to
beauny
the
name
by
which
lupin
was
known
at
bruggen
and
it
contained
these
words
we
know
the
whole
truth
revelations
impossible
by
letter
will
take
train
meet
me
eight
morning
bruggen
station
excellent
said
lupin
who
was
watching
pierre
leduc
movements
from
a
neighboring
coppice
excellent
in
two
minutes
from
now
the
young
idiot
will
have
shown
dolores
the
telegram
and
told
her
all
my
fears
they
will
talk
about
it
all
day
and
other
one
will
hear
other
one
will
know
because
he
knows
everything
because
he
lives
in
dolores
own
shadow
and
because
dolores
is
like
a
fascinated
prey
in
his
hands
and
he
walked
away
humming
to
himself
we
shall
dance
such
a
waltz
my
boys
the
waltz
of
blood
to
the
tune
of
the
little
dagger
we
shall
have
some
fun
at
last
he
reached
the
chalet
called
to
octave
went
to
his
room
flung
himself
on
his
bed
and
said
to
the
chauffeur
sit
down
in
that
chair
octave
and
keep
awake
your
master
is
going
to
take
forty
winks
watch
over
him
you
faithful
servant
he
had
a
good
sleep
like
napoleon
on
the
morning
of
austerlitz
he
said
when
he
woke
up
it
was
he
made
a
hearty
meal
and
then
while
he
smoked
a
cigarette
inspected
his
weapons
and
renewed
the
charges
of
his
two
revolvers
keep
your
powder
dry
and
your
sword
sharpened
as
my
chum
the
kaiser
says
octave
octave
appeared
go
and
have
your
dinner
at
the
castle
with
the
servants
tell
them
you
are
going
to
paris
in
the
motor
with
you
governor
no
alone
and
as
soon
as
dinner
is
over
make
a
start
ostensibly
but
i
am
not
to
go
to
paris
no
remain
outside
the
park
half
a
mile
down
the
road
until
i
come
you
will
have
a
long
wait
he
smoked
another
cigarette
went
for
a
stroll
passed
in
front
of
the
castle
saw
a
light
in
dolores
rooms
and
then
returned
to
the
chalet
there
he
took
up
a
book
it
was
lives
of
illustrious
there
is
one
missing
the
most
illustrious
of
all
but
the
future
will
put
that
right
and
i
shall
have
my
plutarch
some
day
or
other
he
read
the
life
of
cæsar
and
jotted
down
a
few
reflections
in
the
margin
at
eleven
he
went
to
his
bedroom
through
the
open
window
he
gazed
into
the
immense
cool
night
all
astir
with
indistinct
sounds
memories
rose
to
his
lips
memories
of
fond
phrases
which
he
had
read
or
uttered
and
he
repeatedly
whispered
dolores
name
with
the
fervor
of
a
stripling
who
hardly
dares
confide
to
the
silence
the
name
of
his
beloved
he
left
the
window
half
open
pushed
aside
a
table
that
blocked
the
way
and
put
his
revolvers
under
his
pillow
then
peacefully
without
evincing
the
least
excitement
he
got
into
bed
fully
dressed
as
he
was
and
blew
out
the
candle
his
fear
it
was
immediate
no
sooner
did
he
feel
the
darkness
around
him
than
his
fear
began
damn
it
all
he
cried
he
jumped
out
of
bed
took
his
weapons
and
threw
them
into
the
passage
my
hands
my
hands
alone
nothing
comes
up
to
the
grip
of
my
hands
he
went
to
bed
again
darkness
and
silence
once
more
and
once
more
his
fear
the
village
clock
struck
twelve
lupin
thought
of
the
foul
monster
who
outside
at
a
hundred
yards
at
fifty
yards
from
where
he
lay
was
trying
the
sharp
point
of
his
dagger
let
him
come
let
him
come
whispered
lupin
shuddering
then
the
ghosts
will
vanish
one
in
the
village
and
minutes
passed
endless
minutes
minutes
of
fever
and
anguish
beads
of
perspiration
stood
at
the
roots
of
his
hair
and
trickled
down
his
forehead
and
he
felt
as
though
his
whole
frame
were
bathed
in
a
sweat
of
blood
two
and
now
somewhere
quite
close
a
hardly
perceptible
sound
stirred
a
sound
of
leaves
moving
but
different
from
the
sound
of
leaves
moving
in
the
night
breeze
as
lupin
had
foreseen
he
was
at
once
pervaded
by
an
immense
calm
all
his
adventurous
being
quivered
with
delight
the
struggle
was
at
hand
at
last
another
sound
grated
under
the
window
more
plainly
this
time
but
still
so
faint
that
it
needed
lupin
trained
ear
to
distinguish
it
minutes
terrifying
minutes
the
darkness
was
impenetrable
no
light
of
star
or
moon
relieved
it
and
suddenly
without
hearing
anything
he
that
the
man
was
in
the
room
and
the
man
walked
toward
the
bed
he
walked
as
a
ghost
walks
without
displacing
the
air
of
the
room
without
shaking
the
objects
which
he
touched
but
with
all
his
instinct
with
all
his
nervous
force
lupin
saw
the
movements
of
the
enemy
and
guessed
the
very
sequence
of
his
ideas
he
himself
did
not
budge
but
remained
propped
against
the
wall
almost
on
his
knees
ready
to
spring
he
felt
that
the
figure
was
touching
feeling
the
to
find
the
spot
at
which
it
must
strike
lupin
heard
its
breath
he
even
thought
that
he
heard
the
beating
of
its
heart
and
he
noticed
with
pride
that
his
own
heart
beat
no
louder
than
before
whereas
the
heart
of
the
other
oh
yes
he
could
hear
it
now
that
disordered
mad
heart
knocking
like
a
clapper
of
a
bell
against
the
cavity
of
the
chest
the
hand
of
the
other
rose
a
second
two
seconds
was
he
hesitating
was
he
once
more
going
to
spare
his
adversary
and
lupin
in
the
great
silence
said
but
strike
why
do
you
strike
a
yell
of
rage
the
arm
fell
as
though
moved
by
a
spring
then
came
a
moan
lupin
had
caught
the
arm
in
at
the
level
of
the
wrist
and
leaping
out
of
bed
tremendous
irresistible
he
clutched
the
man
by
the
throat
and
threw
him
that
was
all
there
was
no
struggle
there
was
no
possibility
even
of
a
struggle
the
man
lay
on
the
floor
nailed
pinned
by
two
steel
rivets
which
were
lupin
hands
and
there
was
not
a
man
in
the
world
strong
enough
to
release
himself
from
that
grip
and
not
a
word
lupin
uttered
none
of
those
phrases
in
which
his
mocking
humor
usually
delighted
he
had
no
inclination
to
speak
the
moment
was
too
solemn
he
felt
no
vain
glee
no
victorious
exaltation
in
reality
he
had
but
one
longing
to
know
who
was
there
louis
de
malreich
the
man
sentenced
to
death
or
another
which
was
it
at
the
risk
of
strangling
the
man
he
squeezed
the
throat
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
still
and
he
felt
that
all
the
enemy
strength
all
the
strength
that
remained
to
him
was
leaving
him
the
muscles
of
the
arm
relaxed
and
became
lifeless
the
hand
opened
and
dropped
the
dagger
then
free
to
move
as
he
pleased
with
his
adversary
life
hanging
in
the
terrible
clutch
of
his
fingers
he
took
his
with
one
hand
laid
his
finger
on
the
spring
without
pressing
and
brought
it
close
to
the
man
face
he
had
only
to
press
the
spring
to
wish
to
know
and
he
would
know
for
a
second
he
enjoyed
his
power

three

a
cyclone
passed
through
lupin
brain
a
hurricane
in
which
roars
of
thunder
gusts
of
wind
squalls
of
all
the
distraught
elements
were
tumultuously
unchained
in
the
chaotic
night
and
great
flashes
of
lightning
shot
through
the
darkness
and
by
the
dazzling
gleam
of
those
lupin
scared
shaken
with
thrills
convulsed
with
horror
saw
and
tried
to
understand
he
did
not
move
clinging
to
the
enemy
throat
as
if
his
stiffened
fingers
were
no
longer
able
to
release
their
grip
besides
although
he
now
he
had
not
so
to
speak
the
exact
feeling
that
it
was
dolores
it
was
still
the
man
in
black
louis
de

the
foul
brute
of
the
darkness
and
that
brute
he
held
and
did
not
mean
to
let
go
but
the
truth
rushed
upon
the
attack
of
his
mind
and
of
his
consciousness
and
conquered
tortured
with
anguish
he
muttered
oh
dolores
dolores
he
at
once
saw
the
excuse
it
was
madness
she
was
mad
the
sister
of
altenheim
and
isilda
the
daughter
of
the
last
of
the
malreichs
of
the
demented
mother
of
the
drunken
father
was
herself
mad
a
strange
madwoman
mad
with
every
appearance
of
sanity
but
mad
nevertheless
unbalanced
unnatural
truly
monstrous
that
he
most
certainly
understood
it
was
homicidal
madness
under
the
obsession
of
an
object
toward
which
she
was
drawn
automatically
she
killed
thirsting
for
blood
unconsciously
infernally
she
killed
because
she
wanted
something
she
killed
in
she
killed
because
she
had
killed
before
but
she
killed
also
and
especially
for
the
sake
of
killing
murder
satisfied
sudden
and
irresistible
appetites
that
arose
in
her
at
certain
seconds
in
her
life
in
certain
circumstances
face
to
face
with
this
or
that
being
who
had
suddenly
become
the
foe
her
arm
had
to
strike
and
she
struck
drunk
with
rage
ferociously
frenziedly
a
strange
madwoman
not
answerable
for
her
murders
and
yet
so
lucid
in
her
blindness
so
logical
in
her
mental
derangement
so
intelligent
in
her
absurdity
what
skill
what
perseverance
what
cunning
contrivances
at
once
abominable
and
admirable
and
lupin
in
a
rapid
view
with
prodigious
keenness
of
outlook
saw
the
long
array
of
bloodthirsty
adventures
and
guessed
the
mysterious
paths
which
dolores
had
pursued
he
saw
her
obsessed
and
possessed
by
her
husband
scheme
a
scheme
which
she
evidently
understood
only
in
part
he
saw
her
on
her
side
looking
for
that
same
pierre
leduc
whom
her
husband
was
seeking
looking
for
him
in
order
to
marry
him
and
to
return
as
queen
to
that
little
realm
of
veldenz
from
which
her
parents
had
been
ignominiously
driven
and
he
saw
her
at
the
palace
hotel
in
the
room
of
her
brother
altenheim
at
the
time
when
she
was
supposed
to
be
at
monte
carlo
he
saw
her
for
days
together
spying
upon
her
husband
creeping
along
the
walls
one
with
the
darkness
undistinguishable
and
unseen
in
her
shadowy
disguise
and
one
night
she
found
kesselbach
fastened
up
and
she
stabbed
him
and
in
the
morning
when
on
the
point
of
being
denounced
by
the
she
stabbed
him
and
an
hour
later
when
on
the
point
of
being
denounced
by
chapman
she
dragged
him
to
her
brother
room
and
stabbed
him
all
this
pitilessly
savagely
with
diabolical
skill
and
with
the
same
skill
she
communicated
by
telephone
with
her
two
maids
gertrude
and
suzanne
both
of
whom
had
arrived
from
monte
carlo
where
one
of
them
had
enacted
the
part
of
her
mistress
and
dolores
resuming
her
feminine
attire
discarding
the
fair
wig
that
altered
her
appearance
beyond
recognition
went
down
to
the
joined
gertrude
at
the
moment
when
the
maid
entered
the
hotel
and
pretended
herself
to
have
just
arrived
all
ignorant
of
the
tragedy
that
awaited
her
an
incomparable
actress
she
played
the
part
of
the
wife
whose
life
is
shattered
every
one
pitied
her
every
one
wept
for
her
who
could
have
suspected
her
and
then
came
the
war
with
him
lupin
that
barbarous
contest
that
unparalleled
contest
which
she
waged
by
turns
against
lenormand
and
prince
sernine
spending
her
days
stretched
on
her
sofa
ill
and
fainting
but
her
nights
on
foot
scouring
the
roads
indefatigable
and
terrible
and
the
diabolical
contrivances
gertrude
and
suzanne
frightened
and
subdued
accomplices
both
of
them
serving
her
as
emissaries
disguising
themselves
to
represent
her
perhaps
as
on
the
day
when
old
steinweg
was
carried
off
by
baron
altenheim
in
the
middle
of
the
palais
de
justice
and
the
series
of
murders
gourel
drowned
altenheim
her
brother
stabbed
oh
the
implacable
struggle
in
the
underground
passages
of
the
villa
des
glycines
the
invisible
work
performed
by
the
monster
in
the
dark
how
clear
it
all
appeared
and
it
was
she
who
tore
off
his
mask
as
prince
sernine
she
who
betrayed
him
to
the
police
she
who
sent
him
to
prison
she
who
thwarted
all
his
plans
spending
her
millions
to
win
the
battle
and
then
events
followed
faster
suzanne
and
gertrude
disappeared
dead
no
doubt
steinweg
assassinated
isilda
the
sister
assassinated
oh
the
ignominy
the
horror
of
it
stammered
lupin
with
a
start
of
revulsion
and
hatred
he
execrated
her
the
abominable
creature
he
would
have
liked
to
crush
her
to
destroy
her
and
it
was
a
stupefying
sight
those
two
beings
clinging
to
each
other
lying
motionless
in
the
pale
dawn
that
began
to
mingle
with
the
shades
of
the
night
dolores
dolores
he
muttered
in
despair
he
leapt
back
what
was
it
what
was
that
what
was
that
hideous
feeling
of
cold
which
froze
his
hands
octave
octave
he
shouted
forgetting
that
the
chauffeur
was
not
there
help
he
needed
help
some
one
to
reassure
him
and
assist
him
he
shivered
with
fright
oh
that
coldness
that
coldness
of
death
which
he
had
felt
was
it
possible
then
during
those
few
tragic
minutes
with
his
clenched
fingers
he
had
violently
he
forced
himself
to
look
dolores
did
not
stir
he
flung
himself
on
his
knees
and
drew
her
to
him
she
was
dead
he
remained
for
some
seconds
a
prey
to
a
sort
of
numbness
in
which
his
grief
seemed
to
be
swallowed
up
he
no
longer
suffered
he
no
longer
felt
rage
nor
hatred
nor
emotion
of
any
kind
nothing
but
a
stupid
prostration
the
sensation
of
a
man
who
has
received
a
blow
with
a
club
and
who
does
not
know
if
he
is
still
alive
if
he
is
thinking
or
if
he
is
the
sport
of
a
nightmare
nevertheless
it
seemed
to
him
that
an
act
of
justice
had
taken
place
and
it
did
not
for
a
second
occur
to
him
that
it
was
he
who
had
taken
life
no
it
was
not
he
it
was
outside
him
and
his
will
it
was
destiny
inexorable
destiny
that
had
accomplished
the
work
of
equity
by
slaying
the
noxious
beast
outside
the
birds
were
singing
life
was
recommencing
under
the
old
trees
which
the
spring
was
preparing
to
bring
into
bud
and
lupin
waking
from
his
torpor
felt
gradually
welling
up
within
him
an
indefinable
and
ridiculous
compassion
for
the
wretched
woman
odious
certainly
abject
and
twenty
times
criminal
but
so
young
still
and
now
dead
and
he
thought
of
the
tortures
which
she
must
have
undergone
in
her
lucid
moments
when
reason
returned
to
the
unspeakable
madwoman
and
brought
the
sinister
vision
of
her
deeds
protect
me
i
am
so
unhappy
she
used
to
beg
it
was
against
herself
that
she
asked
to
be
protected
against
her
instincts
against
the
monster
that
dwelt
within
her
and
forced
her
to
kill
always
to
kill
always
lupin
asked
himself
and
he
remembered
the
night
two
days
since
when
standing
over
him
with
her
dagger
raised
against
the
enemy
who
had
been
harassing
her
for
months
against
the
indefatigable
enemy
who
had
run
her
to
earth
after
each
of
her
crimes
he
remembered
that
on
that
night
she
had
not
killed
and
yet
it
would
have
been
easy
the
enemy
lay
lifeless
and
powerless
one
blow
and
the
implacable
struggle
was
over
no
she
had
not
killed
she
too
had
given
way
to
feelings
stronger
than
her
own
cruelty
to
mysterious
feelings
of
pity
of
sympathy
of
admiration
for
the
man
who
had
so
often
mastered
her
no
she
had
not
killed
that
time
and
now
by
a
really
terrifying
vicissitude
of
fate
it
was
he
who
had
killed
her
i
have
taken
life
he
thought
shuddering
from
head
to
foot
these
hands
have
killed
a
living
being
and
that
creature
is
dolores
dolores
dolores
he
never
ceased
repeating
her
name
her
name
of
sorrow
and
he
never
ceased
staring
at
her
a
sad
lifeless
thing
harmless
now
a
poor
hunk
of
flesh
with
no
more
consciousness
than
a
little
heap
of
withered
leaves
or
a
little
dead
bird
by
the
roadside
oh
how
could
he
do
other
than
quiver
with
compassion
seeing
that
of
those
two
face
to
face
he
was
the
murderer
and
she
who
was
no
more
the
victim
dolores
dolores
dolores
the
daylight
found
lupin
seated
beside
the
dead
woman
remembering
and
thinking
while
his
lips
from
time
to
time
uttered
the
disconsolate
syllables
dolores
dolores
he
had
to
act
however
and
in
the
disorder
of
his
ideas
he
did
not
know
how
to
act
nor
with
what
act
to
begin
i
must
close
her
eyes
first
he
said
the
eyes
all
empty
filled
only
with
death
those
beautiful
eyes
had
still
the
melancholy
softness
that
gave
them
their
charm
was
it
possible
that
those
eyes
were
the
eyes
of
a
monster
in
spite
of
himself
and
in
the
face
of
the
implacable
reality
lupin
was
not
yet
able
to
blend
into
one
single
being
those
two
creatures
whose
images
remained
so
distinct
at
the
back
of
his
brain
he
stooped
swiftly
lowered
the
long
silky
eyelids
and
covered
the
poor
distorted
face
with
a
veil
then
it
seemed
to
him
that
dolores
was
farther
away
and
that
the
man
in
black
was
really
there
this
time
in
his
dark
clothes
in
his
murderer
disguise
he
now
ventured
to
touch
her
to
feel
in
her
clothes
in
an
inside
pocket
were
two
he
took
one
of
them
and
opened
it
he
found
first
a
letter
signed
by
steinweg
the
old
german
it
contained
the
following
lines
should
i
die
before
being
able
to
reveal
the
terrible
secret
let
it
be
known
that
the
murderer
of
my
friend
kesselbach
is
his
wife
whose
real
name
is
dolores
de
malreich
sister
to
altenheim
and
sister
to
isilda
the
initials
and
relate
to
her
kesselbach
never
in
their
private
life
called
his
wife
dolores
which
is
the
name
of
sorrow
but
letitia
which
denotes
joy
letitia
de
malreich
were
the
initials
inscribed
on
all
the
presents
which
he
used
to
give
her
for
instance
on
the
which
was
found
at
the
palace
hotel
and
which
belonged
to
kesselbach
she
had
contracted
the
on
her
travels
letitia
she
was
indeed
the
joy
of
his
life
for
four
years
four
years
of
lies
and
hypocrisy
in
which
she
prepared
the
death
of
the
man
who
loved
her
so
well
and
who
trusted
her
so
perhaps
i
ought
to
have
spoken
at
once
i
had
not
the
courage
in
memory
of
my
old
friend
kesselbach
whose
name
she
bore
and
then
i
was
afraid
on
the
day
when
i
unmasked
her
at
the
palais
de
justice
i
read
my
doom
in
her
eyes
will
my
weakness
save
me
him
also
thought
lupin
him
also
she
killed
why
of
course
he
knew
too
much
the
initials
that
name
letitia
the
secret
habit
of
smoking
and
he
remembered
the
previous
night
that
smell
of
tobacco
in
her
room
he
continued
his
inspection
of
the
first
there
were
scraps
of
letters
in
cipher
no
doubt
handed
to
dolores
by
her
accomplices
in
the
course
of
their
nocturnal
meetings
there
were
also
addresses
on
bits
of
paper
addresses
of
milliners
and
dressmakers
but
addresses
also
of
low
haunts
of
common
hotels
and
names
twenty
thirty
names
queer
names
hector
the
butcher
armand
of
grenelle
the
sick
man
but
a
photograph
caught
lupin
eye
he
looked
at
it
and
at
once
as
though
shot
from
a
spring
dropping
the
he
bolted
out
of
the
room
out
of
the
chalet
and
rushed
into
the
park
he
had
recognized
the
portrait
of
louis
de
malreich
the
prisoner
at
the
santé
not
till
then
not
till
that
exact
moment
did
he
remember
the
execution
was
to
take
place
next
day
and
as
the
man
in
black
as
the
murderer
was
none
other
than
dolores
kesselbach
louis
de
malreich
name
was
really
and
truly
leon
massier
and
he
was
innocent
innocent
but
the
evidence
found
in
his
house
the
emperor
letters
all
all
the
things
that
accused
him
beyond
hope
of
denial
all
those
incontrovertible
proofs
lupin
stopped
for
a
second
with
his
brain
on
fire
oh
he
cried
i
shall
go
mad
i
too
come
though
i
must
act
the
sentence
is
to
be
executed
at
break
of
day
he
looked
at
his
watch
ten
how
long
will
it
take
me
to
reach
paris
well
i
shall
be
there
presently
yes
presently
i
must
and
this
very
evening
i
shall
take
measures
to
prevent
but
what
measures
how
can
i
prove
his
innocence
how
prevent
the
execution
oh
never
mind
once
i
am
there
i
shall
find
a
way
my
name
is
not
lupin
for
nothing
come
on
he
set
off
again
at
a
run
entered
the
castle
and
called
out
pierre
pierre
has
any
one
seen
pierre
leduc
oh
there
you
are
listen
he
took
him
on
one
side
and
jerked
out
in
imperious
tones
listen
dolores
is
not
here
yes
she
was
called
away
on
urgent
business
she
left
last
night
in
my
motor

an
hour
from

empty
and
let
no

forbid
you

serious
reasons

the
key
with
you
wait
for
me
in
the
village
and
once
more
he
darted
away
five
minutes
later
he
was
with
octave
he
jumped
into
the
car
paris
the
journey
was
a
real
race
for
life
or
death
lupin
thinking
that
octave
was
not
driving
fast
enough
took
the
himself
and
drove
at
a
furious
speed
on
the
road
through
the
villages
along
the
crowded
streets
of
the
towns
they
rushed
at
sixty
miles
an
hour
people
whom
they
nearly
upset
roared
and
yelled
with
rage
the
meteor
was
far
away
was
out
of
sight
g
governor
stammered
octave
livid
with
dismay
we
shall
be
stuck
you
perhaps
the
motor
perhaps
but
i
shall
arrive
said
lupin
he
had
a
feeling
as
though
it
were
not
the
car
that
was
carrying
him
but
he
carrying
the
car
and
as
though
he
were
cleaving
space
by
dint
of
his
own
strength
his
own
then
what
miracle
could
prevent
his
arriving
seeing
that
his
strength
was
inexhaustible
his
unbounded
i
shall
arrive
because
i
have
got
to
arrive
he
repeated
and
he
thought
of
the
man
who
would
die
if
he
did
not
arrive
in
time
to
save
him
of
the
mysterious
louis
de
malreich
so
disconcerting
with
his
stubborn
silence
and
his
expressionless
face
and
amid
the
roar
of
the
road
under
the
trees
whose
branches
made
a
noise
as
of
furious
waves
amid
the
buzzing
of
his
thoughts
lupin
all
the
same
strove
to
set
up
an
hypothesis
and
this
hypothesis
became
gradually
more
defined
logical
probable
certain
he
said
to
himself
now
that
he
knew
the
hideous
truth
about
dolores
and
saw
all
the
resources
and
all
the
odious
designs
of
that
crazy
mind
yes
it
was
she
who
contrived
that
most
terrible
plot
against
malreich
what
was
it
she
wanted
to
marry
pierre
leduc
whom
she
had
bewitched
and
to
become
the
sovereign
of
the
little
principality
from
which
she
had
been
banished
the
object
was
attainable
within
reach
of
her
hand
there
was
one
sole
obstacle
i
lupin
who
for
weeks
and
weeks
persistently
barred
her
road
i
whom
she
encountered
after
every
murder
i
whose
perspicacity
she
dreaded
i
who
would
never
lay
down
my
arms
before
i
had
discovered
the
culprit
and
found
the
letters
stolen
from
the
emperor
well
the
culprit
should
be
louis
de
malreich
or
rather
leon
massier
who
was
this
leon
massier
did
she
know
him
before
her
marriage
had
she
been
in
love
with
him
it
is
probable
but
this
no
doubt
we
shall
never
know
one
thing
is
certain
that
she
was
struck
by
the
resemblance
to
leon
massier
in
figure
and
stature
which
she
might
attain
by
dressing
up
like
him
in
black
clothes
and
putting
on
a
fair
wig
she
must
have
noticed
the
eccentric
life
led
by
that
lonely
man
his
nocturnal
expeditions
his
manner
of
walking
in
the
streets
and
of
throwing
any
who
might
follow
him
off
the
scent
and
it
was
in
consequence
of
these
observations
and
in
anticipation
of
possible
eventualities
that
she
advised
kesselbach
to
erase
the
name
of
dolores
from
the
register
of
births
and
to
replace
it
by
the
name
of
louis
so
that
the
initials
might
correspond
with
those
of
leon
massier
the
moment
arrived
at
which
she
must
act
and
thereupon
she
concocted
her
plot
and
proceeded
to
put
it
into
execution
leon
lived
in
the
rue
delaizement
she
ordered
her
accomplices
to
take
up
their
quarters
in
the
street
that
backed
on
to
it
and
she
herself
told
me
the
address
of
dominique
the
and
put
me
on
the
track
of
the
seven
scoundrels
knowing
perfectly
well
that
once
on
the
track
i
was
bound
to
follow
it
to
the
end
that
is
to
say
beyond
the
seven
scoundrels
till
i
came
up
with
their
leader
the
man
who
watched
them
and
who
commanded
them
the
man
in
black
leon
massier
louis
de
malreich
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
came
up
with
the
seven
scoundrels
first
then
what
would
happen
either
i
should
be
beaten
or
we
should
all
destroy
one
another
as
she
must
have
hoped
that
night
in
the
rue
des
vignes
in
either
case
dolores
would
have
been
rid
of
me
but
what
really
happened
was
this
i
captured
the
seven
scoundrels
dolores
fled
from
the
rue
des
vignes
i
found
her
in
the
broker
shed
she
sent
me
after
leon
massier
that
is
to
say
louis
de
malreich
i
found
in
his
house
the
emperor
letters
she
herself
had
placed
and
i
delivered
him
to
justice
and
i
revealed
the
secret
communication
she
herself
had
caused
to
be
between
the
two
and
i
produced
all
the
evidence
she
herself
had
and
i
proved
by
means
of
documents
she
herself
had
that
leon
massier
had
stolen
the
social
status
of
leon
massier
and
that
his
real
name
was
louis
de
malreich
and
louis
de
malreich
was
sentenced
to
death
and
dolores
de
malreich
victorious
at
last
safe
from
all
suspicion
once
the
culprit
was
discovered
released
from
her
infamous
and
criminal
past

husband
dead
her

from
herself
by
me
who
was
sending
the
innocent
man
whom
she
had
substituted
for
herself

the
scaffold

on

grass
of
the

and
continued
no

thousand
times

i
will
not

on
my
conscience

the
snare

a
schoolboy

bullet
through
my
head
they
were
approaching
the
he
leant
out
twenty
francs
more
driver
if

and
he
shouted
to
the
officials
they
passed
through
but
do

lupin
faster

old
ladies
never

about
them
i
pay
the
damage
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
at
the
ministry
of
the
interior
lupin
hurried
across
the
courtyard
and
ran
up
the
main
staircase
the
was
full
of
people
he
scribbled
on
a
sheet
of
paper
prince
sernine
and
hustling
a
messenger
into
a
corner
said
you
know
me
do
you
i
lupin
i
procured
you
this
berth
a
snug
retreat
for
your
old
age
eh
only

to
show
me
in
at
once
there

my
name
through
that
all
i
ask
of
you

premier

thank
you
you
may
be
sure
of
that
and
so
i
will
but
hurry
you
fool
valenglay
is
expecting
me
ten
seconds
later
valenglay
himself
put
his
head
through
the
door
of
his
room
and
said
show
the
prince
in
lupin
rushed
into
the
room
slammed
the
door
and
interrupting
the
premier
said
no
no
set
phrases
you
ca
arrest
me
it
would
mean
ruining
yourself
and
compromising
the
emperor
no
it
not
a
question
of
that
look
here
malreich
is
innocent
i
have
discovered
the
real
criminal
it
dolores
kesselbach
she
is
dead
her
body
is
down
there
i
have
undeniable
proofs
there
is
no
doubt
possible
it
was
she
he
stopped
valenglay
seemed
not
to
understand
but
look
here
monsieur
le
president
we
must
save
malreich
only
think
a
judicial
error
an
innocent
man
guillotined
give
your
orders
say
you
have
fresh
information
anything
you
please
but
quick
there
is
no
time
to
lose
valenglay
looked
at
him
attentively
then
went
to
a
table
took
up
a
newspaper
and
handed
it
to
him
pointing
his
finger
at
an
article
as
he
did
so
lupin
cast
his
eye
at
the
and
read
execution
of
the
monster
louis
de
malreich
underwent
the
this
morning
he
read
no
more
thunderstruck
crushed
he
fell
into
the
chair
with
a
moan
of
despair
how
long
he
remained
like
that
he
could
not
say
when
he
was
outside
again
he
remembered
a
great
silence
and
then
valenglay
bending
over
him
and
sprinkling
water
on
his
forehead
he
remembered
above
all
the
premier
hushed
voice
whispering
listen
you
wo
say
anything
about
this
will
you
innocent
perhaps
i
do
say
not
but
what
is
the
use
of
revelations
of
a
scandal
a
judicial
error
can
have
serious
consequences
is
it
worth
while
a
rehabilitation
for
what
purpose
he
was
not
even
sentenced
under
his
own
name
it
is
the
name
of
malreich
which
is
held
up
to
public
execration
the
name
of
the
real
criminal
as
it
happens
so
and
pushing
lupin
gradually
toward
the
door
he
said
so
go
go
back
there
get
rid
of
the
corpse
and
let
not
a
trace
remain
eh
not
the
slightest
trace
of
all
this
business
i
can
rely
on
you
can
i
not
and
lupin
went
back
he
went
back
like
a
machine
because
he
had
been
told
to
do
so
and
because
he
had
no
will
left
of
his
own
he
waited
for
hours
at
the
mechanically
he
ate
his
dinner
took
a
ticket
and
settled
down
in
a
compartment
he
slept
badly
his
brain
was
on
fire
between
nightmares
and
intervals
in
which
he
tried
to
make
out
why
malreich
had
not
defended
himself
he
was
a
madman
surely
half
a
madman
he
must
have
known
her
formerly
and
she
poisoned
his
life
she
drove
him
crazy
so
he
felt
he
might
as
well
die
why
defend
himself
the
explanation
only
half
satisfied
him
and
he
promised
himself
sooner
or
later
to
clear
up
the
riddle
and
to
discover
the
exact
part
which
massier
had
played
in
dolores
life
but
what
did
it
matter
for
the
moment
one
fact
alone
stood
out
clearly
which
was
massier
madness
and
he
repeated
persistently
he
was
a
madman
massier
was
undoubtedly
mad
besides
all
those
massiers
a
family
of
madmen
he
raved
mixing
up
names
in
his
enfeebled
brain
but
on
alighting
at
bruggen
station
in
the
cool
moist
air
of
the
morning
his
consciousness
revived
things
suddenly
assumed
a
different
aspect
and
he
exclaimed
well
after
all
it
was
his
own
he
had
only
to
protest
i
accept
no
responsibility
it
was
he
who
committed
suicide
he
was
only
a
dumb
actor
in
the
play
he
has
gone
under
i
am
sorry
but
it
ca
be
helped
the
necessity
for
action
stimulated
him
afresh
wounded
tortured
by
that
crime
of
which
he
knew
himself
to
be
the
author
for
all
that
he
might
say
he
nevertheless
looked
to
the
future
those
are
the
accidents
of
war
he
said
do
let
us
think
about
it
nothing
is
lost
on
the
contrary
dolores
was
the
since
pierre
leduc
loved
her
dolores
is
dead
therefore
pierre
leduc
belongs
to
me
and
he
shall
marry
geneviève
as
i
have
arranged
and
he
shall
reign
and
i
shall
be
the
master
and
europe
europe
is
mine
he
worked
himself
up
reassured
full
of
sudden
confidence
and
made
feverish
gestures
as
he
walked
along
the
road
whirling
an
imaginary
sword
the
sword
of
the
leader
whose
will
is
law
who
commands
and
triumphs
lupin
you
shall
be
king
you
shall
be
king
arsène
lupin
he
inquired
in
the
village
of
bruggen
and
heard
that
pierre
leduc
had
lunched
yesterday
at
the
inn
since
then
he
had
not
been
seen
oh
asked
lupin
did
he
sleep
here
no
but
where
did
he
go
after
his
lunch
he
took
the
road
to
the
castle
lupin
walked
away
in
some
surprise
after
all
he
had
told
the
young
man
to
lock
the
doors
and
not
to
return
after
the
servants
had
gone
he
at
once
received
a
proof
that
pierre
had
disobeyed
him
the
park
gates
were
open
he
went
in
hunted
all
over
the
castle
called
out
no
reply
suddenly
he
thought
of
the
chalet
who
could
tell
perhaps
pierre
leduc
worrying
about
the
woman
he
loved
and
driven
by
an
intuition
had
gone
to
look
for
her
in
that
direction
and
dolores
corpse
was
there
greatly
alarmed
lupin
began
to
run
at
first
sight
there
seemed
to
be
no
one
in
the
chalet
pierre
pierre
he
cried
hearing
no
sound
he
entered
the
front
passage
and
the
room
which
he
had
occupied
he
stopped
short
rooted
to
the
threshold
above
dolores
corpse
hung
pierre
leduc
with
a
rope
round
his
neck
dead
lupin
impatiently
pulled
himself
together
from
head
to
foot
he
refused
to
yield
to
a
single
gesture
of
despair
he
refused
to
utter
a
single
violent
word
after
the
cruel
blows
which
fate
had
dealt
him
after
dolores
crimes
and
death
after
massier
execution
after
all
those
disturbances
and
catastrophes
he
felt
the
absolute
necessity
of
retaining
all
his
if
not
his
brain
would
undoubtedly
give
way
idiot
he
said
shaking
his
fist
at
pierre
leduc
you
great
idiot
could
you
wait
in
ten
years
we
should
have
had
again
to
relieve
his
mind
he
sought
for
words
to
say
for
attitudes
but
his
ideas
escaped
him
and
his
head
seemed
on
the
point
of
bursting
oh
no
no
he
cried
none
of
that
thank
you
lupin
mad
too
no
old
chap
put
a
bullet
through
your
head
if
you
like
and
when
all
is
said
i
do
see
any
other
way
out
but
lupin
drivelling
wheeled
about
in
a
no
style
old
fellow
finish
in
style
he
walked
up
and
down
stamping
his
feet
and
lifting
his
knees
very
high
as
certain
actors
do
when
feigning
madness
and
he
said
swagger
my
lad
swagger
the
eyes
of
the
gods
are
upon
you
lift
up
your
head
pull
in
your
stomach
hang
it
throw
out
your
chest
everything
is
breaking
up
around
you
what
do
you
care
it
the
final
disaster
i
played
my
last
card
a
kingdom
in
the
gutter
lost
europe
the
whole
world
ends
in
smoke
well
and
what
of
it
laugh
laugh
be
lupin
or
you
in
the
soup
come
laugh
louder
than
that
louder
louder
that
right
lord
how
funny
it
all
is
dolores
old
girl
a
cigarette
he
bent
down
with
a
grin
touched
the
dead
woman
face
tottered
for
a
second
and
fell
to
the
ground
unconscious
after
lying
for
an
hour
he
came
to
himself
and
stood
up
the
fit
of
madness
was
over
and
master
of
himself
with
relaxed
nerves
serious
and
silent
he
considered
the
position
he
felt
that
the
time
had
come
for
the
irrevocable
decisions
that
involve
a
whole
existence
his
had
been
utterly
shattered
in
a
few
days
under
the
assault
of
unforeseen
catastrophes
rushing
up
one
after
the
other
at
the
very
moment
when
he
thought
his
triumph
assured
what
should
he
do
begin
again
build
up
everything
again
he
had
not
the
courage
for
it
what
then
the
whole
morning
he
roamed
tragically
about
the
park
and
gradually
realized
his
position
in
all
its
slightest
details
little
by
little
the
thought
of
death
enforced
itself
upon
him
with
inflexible
rigor
but
whether
he
decided
to
kill
himself
or
to
live
there
was
first
of
all
a
series
of
definite
acts
which
he
was
obliged
to
perform
and
these
acts
stood
out
clearly
in
his
brain
which
had
suddenly
become
quite
cool
the
angelus
rang
from
the
to
work
he
said
firmly
he
returned
to
the
chalet
in
a
very
calm
frame
of
mind
went
to
his
room
climbed
on
a
stool
and
cut
the
rope
by
which
pierre
leduc
was
hanging
you
poor
devil
he
said
you
were
doomed
to
end
like
that
with
a
hempen
tie
around
your
neck
alas
you
were
not
made
for
greatness
i
ought
to
have
foreseen
that
and
not
hooked
my
fortune
to
a
rhymester
he
felt
in
the
young
man
clothes
and
found
nothing
but
remembering
dolores
second
he
took
it
from
the
pocket
where
he
had
left
it
he
gave
a
start
of
surprise
the
contained
a
bundle
of
letters
whose
appearance
was
familiar
to
him
and
he
at
once
recognized
the
different
writings
the
emperor
letters
he
muttered
slowly
the
old
letters
the
whole
bundle
which
i
myself
found
at
leon
massier
and
which
i
handed
to
count
von
waldemar
how
did
it
happen
did
she
take
them
in
her
turn
from
that
blockhead
of
a
waldemar
and
suddenly
slapping
his
forehead
why
no
the
blockhead
is
myself
these
are
the
real
letters
she
kept
them
to
blackmail
the
emperor
when
the
time
came
and
the
others
the
ones
which
i
handed
over
are
copies
forged
by
herself
of
course
or
by
an
accomplice
and
placed
where
she
knew
that
i
should
find
them
and
i
played
her
game
for
her
like
a
mug
by
jove
when
women
begin
to
interfere
there
was
only
a
piece
of
pasteboard
left
in
the
a
photograph
he
looked
at
it
it
was
his
own
two
photographs
massier
and
i
the
two
she
loved
best
no
doubt
for
she
loved
me
a
strange
love
built
up
of
admiration
for
the
adventurer
that
i
am
for
the
man
who
by
himself
put
away
the
seven
scoundrels
whom
she
had
paid
to
break
my
head
a
strange
love
i
felt
it
throbbing
in
her
the
other
day
when
i
told
her
my
great
dream
of
omnipotence
then
really
she
had
the
idea
of
sacrificing
pierre
leduc
and
subjecting
her
dream
to
mine
if
the
incident
of
the
mirror
had
not
taken
place
she
would
have
been
subdued
but
she
was
afraid
i
had
my
hand
upon
the
truth
my
death
was
necessary
for
her
salvation
and
she
decided
upon
it
he
repeated
several
times
pensively
and
yet
she
loved
me
yes
she
loved
me
as
others
have
loved
me
others
to
whom
i
have
brought
also
alas
all
those
who
love
me
die
and
this
one
died
too
strangled
by
my
hand
what
is
the
use
of
living
what
is
the
use
of
living
he
asked
again
in
a
low
voice
is
it
not
better
to
join
them
all
those
women
who
have
loved
me
and
who
have
died
of
their
love
sonia
raymonde
clotilde
destange
miss
clarke
he
laid
the
two
corpses
beside
each
other
covered
them
with
the
same
sheet
sat
down
at
a
table
and
wrote
i
have
triumphed
over
everything
and
i
am
beaten
i
have
reached
the
goal
and
i
have
fallen
fate
is
too
strong
for
me
and
she
whom
i
loved
is
no
more
i
shall
die
also
and
he
signed
his
name
arsène
lupin
he
sealed
the
letter
and
slipped
it
into
a
bottle
which
he
flung
through
the
window
on
the
soft
ground
of
a
next
he
made
a
great
pile
on
the
floor
with
old
newspapers
straw
and
shavings
which
he
went
to
fetch
in
the
kitchen
on
the
top
of
it
he
emptied
a
gallon
of
petrol
then
he
lit
a
candle
and
threw
it
among
the
shavings
a
flame
at
once
arose
and
other
flames
leapt
forth
quick
glowing
crackling
let
clear
out
said
lupin
the
chalet
is
built
of
wood
it
will
all
flare
up
like
a
match
and
by
the
time
they
come
from
the
village
break
down
the
gates
and
run
to
this
end
of
the
park
it
will
be
too
late
they
will
find
ashes
the
remains
of
two
charred
corpses
and
close
at
hand
my
farewell
letter
in
a
bottle
lupin
bury
me
simply
good
people
without
superfluous
state
a
poor
man
funeral
no
flowers
no
wreaths
just
a
humble
cross
and
a
plain
epitaph

arsène
lupin
adventurer
he
made
for
the
park
wall
climbed
over
it
and
turning
round
saw
the
flames
soaring
up
to
the
sky
he
wandered
back
toward
paris
on
foot
bowed
down
by
destiny
with
despair
in
his
heart
and
the
peasants
were
amazed
at
the
sight
of
this
traveller
who
paid
with
for
his
meals
three
attacked
him
one
evening
in
the
forest
he
defended
himself
with
his
stick
and
left
them
lying
for
dead
he
spent
a
week
at
an
inn
he
did
not
know
where
to
go
what
was
he
to
do
what
was
there
for
him
to
cling
to
he
was
tired
of
life
he
did
not
want
to
live
is
that
you
mme
ernemont
stood
in
her
little
in
the
villa
at
garches
trembling
scared
and
livid
staring
at
the
apparition
that
faced
her
lupin
it
was
lupin
you
she
said
you
but
the
papers
said
he
smiled
sadly
yes
i
am
dead
well
then
well
then
she
said
naïvely
you
mean
that
if
i
am
dead
i
have
no
business
here
believe
me
i
have
serious
reasons
victoire
how
you
have
changed
she
said
in
a
voice
full
of
pity
a
few
little
disappointments
however
that
over
tell
me
is
geneviève
in
she
flew
at
him
in
a
sudden
rage
you
leave
her
alone
do
you
hear
geneviève
you
want
to
see
geneviève
to
take
her
back
ah
this
time
i
shall
not
let
her
out
of
my
sight
she
came
back
tired
white
as
a
sheet
nervous
and
the
color
has
hardly
yet
returned
to
her
cheeks
you
shall
leave
her
alone
i
swear
you
shall
he
pressed
his
hand
hard
on
the
old
woman
shoulder
i
do
you
understand
i
speak
to
her
no
i
mean
to
speak
to
her
no
he
pushed
her
about
she
drew
herself
up
and
crossing
her
arms
you
shall
pass
over
my
dead
body
first
do
you
hear
the
happiness
lies
in
this
house
and
nowhere
else
with
all
your
ideas
of
money
and
rank
you
would
only
make
her
miserable
who
is
this
pierre
leduc
of
yours
and
that
veldenz
of
yours
geneviève
a
you
are
mad
that
no
life
for
her
you
see
after
all
you
have
thought
only
of
yourself
in
this
matter
it
was
your
power
your
fortune
you
wanted
the
child
you
do
care
a
rap
about
have
you
so
much
as
asked
yourself
if
she
loved
your
rascally
have
you
asked
yourself
if
she
loved
anybody
no
you
just
pursued
your
object
that
is
all
at
the
risk
of
hurting
geneviève
and
making
her
unhappy
for
the
rest
of
her
life
well
i
wo
have
it
what
she
wants
is
a
simple
honest
existence
led
in
the
broad
light
of
day
and
that
is
what
you
ca
give
her
then
what
are
you
here
for
he
seemed
to
waver
but
nevertheless
he
murmured
in
a
low
voice
and
very
sadly
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
never
see
her
again
it
is
impossible
that
i
should
not
speak
to
her
she
believes
you
dead
that
is
exactly
what
i
do
not
want
i
want
her
to
know
the
truth
it
is
a
torture
to
me
to
think
that
she
looks
upon
me
as
one
who
is
no
more
bring
her
to
me
victoire
he
spoke
in
a
voice
so
gentle
and
so
distressed
that
she
was
utterly
moved
and
said
listen
first
of
all
i
want
to
know
it
depends
upon
what
you
intend
to
say
to
her
be
frank
my
boy
what
do
you
want
with
geneviève
he
said
gravely
i
want
to
say
this
i
promised
your
mother
to
give
you
wealth
power
a
existence
and
on
the
day
when
i
had
attained
my
aim
i
would
have
asked
you
for
a
little
place
not
very
far
from
you
rich
and
happy
you
would
have
forgotten
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
you
would
have
forgotten
who
i
am
or
rather
who
i
was
unfortunately
fate
has
been
too
strong
for
me
i
bring
you
neither
wealth
nor
power
and
it
is
i
on
the
contrary
who
have
need
of
you
geneviève
will
you
help
me
to
do
what
asked
the
old
woman
anxiously
to
live
oh
she
said
has
it
come
to
that
my
poor
boy
yes
he
answered
simply
without
any
affectation
of
sorrow
yes
it
has
come
to
that
three
human
beings
are
just
dead
killed
by
me
killed
by
my
hands
the
burden
of
the
memory
is
more
than
i
can
bear
i
am
alone
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
need
help
i
have
the
right
to
ask
that
help
of
geneviève
and
her
duty
is
to
give
it
to
me
if
not
if
not
then
all
is
over
the
old
woman
was
silent
pale
and
quivering
with
emotion
she
once
more
felt
all
her
affection
for
him
whom
she
had
fed
at
her
breast
and
who
still
and
in
spite
of
all
remained
her
boy
she
asked
what
do
you
intend
to
do
with
her
we
shall
go
abroad
we
will
take
you
with
us
if
you
like
to
come
but
you
forget
you
forget
what
your
past
she
will
forget
it
too
she
will
understand
that
i
am
no
longer
the
man
i
was
that
i
do
not
wish
to
be
then
really
what
you
wish
is
that
she
should
share
your
life
the
life
of
lupin
the
life
of
the
man
that
i
shall
be
of
the
man
who
will
work
so
that
she
may
be
happy
so
that
she
may
marry
according
to
her
inclination
we
will
settle
down
in
some
nook
or
other
we
will
struggle
together
side
by
side
and
you
know
what
i
am
capable
of
she
repeated
slowly
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
then
really
you
wish
her
to
share
lupin
life
he
hesitated
a
second
hardly
a
second
and
declared
plainly
yes
yes
i
wish
it
i
have
the
right
you
wish
her
to
abandon
all
the
children
to
whom
she
has
devoted
herself
all
this
life
of
work
which
she
loves
and
which
is
essential
to
her
happiness
yes
i
wish
it
it
is
her
duty
the
old
woman
opened
the
window
and
said
in
that
case
call
her
geneviève
was
in
the
garden
sitting
on
a
bench
four
little
girls
were
crowding
round
her
others
were
playing
and
running
about
he
saw
her
he
saw
her
grave
smiling
eyes
she
held
a
flower
in
her
hand
and
plucked
the
petals
one
by
one
and
gave
explanations
to
the
attentive
and
eager
children
then
she
asked
them
questions
and
each
answer
was
rewarded
with
a
kiss
to
the
pupil
lupin
looked
at
her
long
with
infinite
emotion
and
anguish
a
whole
leaven
of
unknown
feelings
fermented
within
him
he
had
a
longing
to
press
that
pretty
girl
to
his
breast
to
kiss
her
and
tell
her
how
he
respected
and
loved
her
he
remembered
the
mother
who
died
in
the
little
village
of
aspremont
who
died
of
grief
call
her
said
victoire
why
do
you
call
her
he
sank
into
a
chair
and
stammered
i
ca
i
ca
do
it
i
have
not
the
right
it
is
impossible
let
her
believe
me
dead
that
is
better
he
wept
his
shoulders
shaking
with
sobs
his
whole
being
overwhelmed
with
despair
swollen
with
an
affection
that
arose
in
him
like
those
backward
flowers
which
die
on
the
very
day
of
their
blossoming
the
old
woman
knelt
down
beside
him
and
in
a
trembling
voice
asked
she
is
your
daughter
is
she
not
yes
she
is
my
daughter
oh
my
poor
boy
she
said
bursting
into
tears

poor
boy
epilogue
the
suicide
to
horse
said
the
emperor
he
corrected
himself
on
seeing
the
magnificent
ass
which
they
brought
him
to
donkey
rather
waldemar
are
you
sure
this
animal
is
quiet
to
ride
and
drive
i
will
answer
for
him
as
i
would
for
myself
sire
declared
the
count
in
that
case
i
feel
safe
said
the
emperor
laughing
and
turning
to
the
officers
with
him
gentlemen
to
horse
the
of
the
village
of
capri
was
crowded
with
kept
back
by
a
line
of
italian
carabiniers
and
in
the
middle
all
the
donkeys
of
the
place
which
had
been
requisitioned
to
enable
the
emperor
to
go
over
that
island
of
wonders
waldemar
said
the
emperor
taking
the
head
of
the
cavalcade
what
do
we
begin
with
with
tiberius
villa
sire
they
rode
under
a
gateway
and
then
followed
a
path
rising
gradually
to
the
eastern
promontory
of
the
island
the
emperor
laughed
and
enjoyed
himself
and
chaffed
the
colossal
count
von
waldemar
whose
feet
touched
the
ground
on
either
side
of
the
unfortunate
donkey
borne
down
under
his
weight
in
of
an
hour
they
arrived
first
at
tiberius
leap
an
enormous
rock
a
thousand
feet
high
from
which
the
tyrant
caused
his
victims
to
be
hurled
into
the
sea
the
emperor
dismounted
walked
up
to
the
and
took
a
glance
at
the
abyss
then
he
went
on
foot
to
the
ruins
of
tiberius
villa
where
he
strolled
about
among
the
crumbling
halls
and
passages
he
stopped
for
a
moment
there
was
a
glorious
view
of
the
point
of
sorrento
and
over
the
whole
island
of
capri
the
glowing
blue
of
the
sea
outlined
the
beautiful
curve
of
the
bay
and
cool
perfumes
mingled
with
the
scent
of
the
the
view
is
finer
still
sire
said
waldemar
from
the
little
chapel
at
the
summit
let
us
go
to
it
but
the
hermit
himself
descended
by
a
steep
path
he
was
an
old
man
with
a
hesitating
gait
and
a
bent
back
he
carried
the
book
in
which
travellers
usually
write
down
their
impressions
he
placed
the
book
on
a
stone
seat
what
am
i
write
asked
the
emperor
your
name
sire
and
the
date
of
your
visit
and
anything
you
please
the
emperor
took
the
pen
which
the
hermit
handed
him
and
bent
down
to
write
take
care
sire
take
care
shouts
of
alarm
a
great
crash
from
the
direction
of
the
chapel
the
emperor
turned
round
he
saw
a
huge
rock
come
rolling
down
upon
him
like
a
whirlwind
at
the
same
moment
he
was
seized
round
the
body
by
the
hermit
and
flung
to
a
distance
of
ten
yards
away
the
rock
struck
against
the
stone
seat
where
the
emperor
had
been
standing
a
quarter
of
a
second
before
and
smashed
the
seat
into
fragments
but
for
the
hermit
the
emperor
would
have
been
killed
he
gave
him
his
hand
and
said
simply
thank
you
the
officers
flocked
round
him
it
nothing
gentlemen
we
have
escaped
with
a
fright
though
it
was
a
fine
fright
i
confess
all
the
same
but
for
the
intervention
of
this
worthy
man
and
going
up
to
the
hermit
what
is
your
name
my
friend
the
hermit
had
kept
his
head
concealed
in
his
hood
he
pushed
it
back
an
inch
or
so
and
in
a
very
low
voice
so
as
to
be
heard
by
none
but
the
emperor
he
said
the
name
of
a
man
sire
who
is
very
pleased
that
you
have
shaken
him
by
the
hand
the
emperor
gave
a
start
and
stepped
back
then
at
once
controlling
himself
gentlemen
he
said
to
the
officers
i
will
ask
you
to
go
up
to
the
chapel
more
rocks
can
break
loose
and
it
would
perhaps
be
wise
to
warn
the
authorities
of
the
island
you
will
join
me
later
i
want
to
thank
this
good
man
he
walked
away
accompanied
by
the
hermit
when
they
were
alone
he
said
you
why
i
had
to
speak
to
you
sire
if
i
had
asked
for
an
audience
would
you
have
granted
my
request
i
preferred
to
act
directly
and
i
intended
to
make
myself
known
while
your
imperial
majesty
was
signing
the
book
when
that
stupid
accident
well
said
the
emperor
the
letters
which
i
gave
waldemar
to
hand
to
you
sire
are
forgeries
the
emperor
made
a
gesture
of
keen
annoyance
forgeries
are
you
sure
absolutely
sure
sire
yet
that
malreich
malreich
was
not
the
culprit
then
who
was
i
must
beg
your
imperial
majesty
to
treat
my
answer
as
secret
and
confidential
the
real
culprit
was
mrs
kesselbach
kesselbach
own
wife
yes
sire
she
is
dead
now
it
was
she
who
made
or
caused
to
be
made
the
copies
which
are
in
your
possession
she
kept
the
real
letters
but
where
are
they
exclaimed
the
emperor
that
is
the
important
thing
they
must
be
recovered
at
all
costs
i
attach
the
greatest
value
to
those
letters
here
they
are
sire
the
emperor
had
a
moment
of
stupefaction
he
looked
at
lupin
looked
at
the
letters
then
at
lupin
again
and
pocketed
the
bundle
without
examining
it
clearly
this
man
was
puzzling
him
once
more
where
did
this
scoundrel
spring
from
who
possessing
so
terrible
a
weapon
handed
it
over
like
that
generously
unconditionally
it
would
have
been
so
easy
for
him
to
keep
the
letters
and
to
make
such
use
of
them
as
he
pleased
no
he
had
given
his
promise
and
he
was
keeping
his
word
and
the
emperor
thought
of
all
the
astounding
things
which
that
man
had
done
the
papers
said
that
you
were
dead
he
said
yes
sire
in
reality
i
am
dead
and
the
police
of
my
country
glad
to
be
rid
of
me
have
buried
the
charred
and
unrecognizable
remains
of
my
body
then
you
are
free
as
i
always
have
been
and
nothing
attaches
you
to
anything
nothing
sire
in
that
case
the
emperor
hesitated
and
then
explicitly
in
that
case
enter
my
service
i
offer
you
the
command
of
my
private
police
you
shall
be
the
absolute
master
you
shall
have
full
power
even
over
the
other
police
no
sire
why
not
i
am
a
frenchman
there
was
a
pause
the
emperor
was
evidently
pleased
with
the
answer
he
said
still
as
you
say
that
no
link
attaches
you
that
is
one
sire
which
nothing
can
sever
and
he
added
laughing
i
am
dead
as
a
man
but
alive
as
a
frenchman
i
am
sure
that
your
imperial
majesty
will
understand
the
emperor
took
a
few
steps
up
and
down
then
he
said
i
should
like
to
pay
my
debt
however
i
heard
that
the
negotiations
for
the
of
veldenz
were
broken
off
yes
sire
pierre
leduc
was
an
imposter
he
is
dead
what
can
i
do
for
you
you
have
given
me
back
those
letters
you
have
saved
my
life
what
can
i
do
nothing
sire
you
insist
upon
my
remaining
your
debtor
yes
sire
the
emperor
gave
a
last
glance
at
that
strange
man
who
set
himself
up
in
his
presence
as
his
equal
then
he
bowed
his
head
slightly
and
walked
away
without
another
word
aha
majesty
i
caught
you
this
time
said
lupin
following
him
with
his
eyes
and
philosophically
no
doubt
it
a
poor
revenge
and
would
rather
have
recovered
but
still
he
interrupted
himself
and
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
you
confounded
lupin
will
you
never
change
will
you
always
remain
hateful
and
cynical
to
the
last
moment
of
your
existence
be
serious
hang
it
all
the
time
has
come
now
or
never
to
be
serious
he
climbed
the
path
that
leads
to
the
chapel
and
stopped
at
the
place
where
the
rock
had
broken
loose
he
burst
out
laughing
it
was
a
good
piece
of
work
and
his
imperial
majesty
officers
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
but
how
could
they
guess
that
i
myself
loosened
that
rock
that
at
the
last
moment
i
gave
the
decisive
blow
of
the
and
that
the
aforesaid
rock
rolled
down
the
path
which
i
had
made
between
it
and
an
emperor
whose
life
i
was
bent
on
saving
he
sighed
ah
lupin
what
a
complex
mind
you
have
all
that
trouble
because
you
had
sworn
that
this
particular
majesty
should
shake
you
by
the
hand
a
lot
of
good
it
has
done
you
emperor
hand
five
fingers
has
no
more
as
victor
hugo
might
have
said
he
entered
the
chapel
and
with
a
special
key
opened
the
low
door
of
a
little
sacristy
on
a
heap
of
straw
lay
a
man
with
his
hands
and
legs
bound
and
a
gag
in
his
mouth
well
my
friend
the
hermit
said
lupin
it
was
so
very
long
was
it
hours
at
the
most
but
i
have
worked
jolly
hard
on
your
behalf
just
think
you
have
saved
the
emperor
life
yes
old
chap
you
are
the
man
who
saved
the
emperor
life
i
have
made
your
fortune
that
what
i
done
they
build
a
cathedral
for
you
and
put
up
a
statue
to
you
when
you
dead
and
gone
here
take
your
things
the
hermit
nearly
dead
with
hunger
staggered
to
his
feet
lupin
quickly
put
on
his
own
clothes
and
said
farewell
o
worthy
and
venerable
man
forgive
me
for
this
little
upset
and
pray
for
me
i
shall
need
it
eternity
is
opening
its
gate
wide
to
me
farewell
he
stood
for
a
few
moments
on
the
threshold
of
the
chapel
it
was
the
solemn
moment
at
which
one
hesitates
in
spite
of
everything
before
the
terrible
end
of
all
things
but
his
resolution
was
irrevocable
and
without
further
reflection
he
darted
out
ran
down
the
slope
crossed
the
level
ground
of
tiberius
leap
and
put
one
leg
over
the
lupin
i
give
you
three
minutes
for
the
good
you
will
say
is
nobody
here
well
and
what
about
you
you
act
your
last
farce
for
yourself
by
jove
the
performance
is
worth
it
heroic
comedy
in
eighty
scenes
the
curtain
rises
on
the
and
the
principal
part
is
played
by
lupin
in
person
lupin
feel
my
heart
ladies
and
gentlemen
seventy
beats
to
the
minute
and
a
smile
on
my
lips
lupin
oh
the
rogue
what
cheek
he
has
well
jump
my
lord
are
you
ready
it
the
last
adventure
old
fellow
no
regrets
regrets
what
for
heavens
above
my
life

splendid
ah

if
you
had
not
come
into
it
abominable
monster
that
you
were
and
you
malreich
why

you
not
speak
and
you
pierre
leduc

dear
geneviève

i
coming
he
pulled
his
other
leg
over
looked
down
the
abyss
at
the
dark
and
motionless
sea
and
raising
his
head
farewell
immortal
and
nature
te
salutat
farewell
all
that
is
beautiful
on
earth
farewell
splendor
of
things
farewell
life
he
flung
kisses
to
space
to
the
sky
to
the
sun
then
folding
his
arms
he
took
the
leap
the
barracks
of
the
foreign
legion
an
adjutant
sat
smoking
and
reading
his
newspaper
in
a
small
room
near
him
close
to
the
window
opening
on
the
yard
two
great
devils
of
officers
were
jabbering
in
guttural
french
mixed
with
teutonic
phrases
the
door
opened
some
one
entered
it
was
a
man
of
medium
height
the
adjutant
rose
glared
angrily
at
the
intruder
and
growled
i
say
what
on
earth
is
the
orderly
up
to
and
you
sir
what
do
you
want
service
this
was
said
frankly
imperiously
the
two
burst
into
a
silly
laugh
the
man
looked
at
them
askance
in
other
words
you
wish
to
enlist
in
the
legion
asked
the
adjutant
yes
but
on
one
condition
conditions
by
jove
what
conditions
that
i
am
not
left
mouldering
here
there
is
a
company
leaving
for
morocco
i
join
that
one
of
the
gave
a
fresh
chuckle
and
was
heard
to
say
the
moors
are
in
for
a
bad
time
the
gentleman
enlisting
silence
cried
the
man
i
do
stand
being
laughed
at
his
voice
sounded
harsh
and
masterful
the
a
giant
retorted
here
recruity
you
better
be
careful
how
you
talk
to
me
or
or
what
you
get
something
you
wo
like
that
all
the
man
went
up
to
him
took
him
round
the
waist
swung
him
over
the
ledge
of
the
window
and
pitched
him
into
the
yard
then
he
said
to
the
other
go
away
the
other
went
away
the
man
at
once
returned
to
the
adjutant
and
said
lieutenant
pray
be
so
good
as
to
tell
the
major
that
don
luis
perenna
a
spanish
grandee
and
a
frenchman

the
flabbergasted
adjutant
did
not
move
go
my
friend
and
go
at
once
i
have
no
time
to
waste
the
adjutant
rose
looked
at
his
astounding
visitor
with
a
bewildered
eye
and
went
out
in
the
tamest
fashion
then
lupin
lit
a
cigarette
and
sitting
down
in
the
adjutant
chair
said
aloud
as
the
sea
refused
to
have
anything
to
say
to
me
or
rather
as
i
at
the
last
moment
refused
to
have
anything
to
say
to
the
sea
we
go
and
see
if
the
bullets
of
the
moors
