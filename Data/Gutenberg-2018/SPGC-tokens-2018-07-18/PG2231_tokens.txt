all

chapter
i
she
had
not
meant
to
stay
for
the
service
the
door
had
stood
invitingly
open
and
a
glimpse
of
the
interior
had
suggested
to
her
the
idea
that
it
would
make
good
copy
old
london
churches
their
social
and
historical
associations
it
would
be
easy
to
collect
anecdotes
of
the
famous
people
who
had
attended
them
she
might
fix
up
a
series
for
one
of
the
religious
papers
it
promised
quite
exceptional
material
this
particular
specimen
rich
in
tombs
and
monuments
there
was
character
about
it
a
scent
of
bygone
days
she
pictured
the
vanished
congregations
in
their
powdered
wigs
and
stiff
brocades
how
picturesque
must
have
been
the
marriages
that
had
taken
place
there
say
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
or
of
the
early
georges
the
church
would
have
been
ancient
even
then
with
its
air
of
faded
grandeur
its
sculptured
recesses
and
dark
niches
the
tattered
banners
hanging
from
its
roof
it
must
have
made
an
admirable
background
perhaps
an
historical
novel
in
the
thackeray
vein
she
could
see
her
heroine
walking
up
the
aisle
on
the
arm
of
her
proud
old
soldier
father
later
on
when
her
journalistic
position
was
more
established
she
might
think
of
it
it
was
still
quite
early
there
would
be
nearly
half
an
hour
before
the
first
worshippers
would
be
likely
to
arrive
just
time
enough
to
jot
down
a
few
notes
if
she
did
ever
take
to
literature
it
would
be
the
realistic
school
she
felt
that
would
appeal
to
her
the
rest
too
would
be
pleasant
after
her
long
walk
from
westminster
she
would
find
a
secluded
seat
in
one
of
the
high
stiff
pews
and
let
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
sink
into
her
and
then
the
had
stolen
up
unobserved
and
had
taken
it
so
for
granted
that
she
would
like
to
be
shown
round
and
had
seemed
so
pleased
and
eager
that
she
had
not
the
heart
to
repel
her
a
curious
little
old
party
with
a
smooth
complexion
and
white
soft
hair
that
the
fading
twilight
stealing
through
the
yellow
glass
turned
to
gold
so
that
at
first
sight
joan
took
her
for
a
child
the
voice
too
was
so
absurdly
childish
appealing
and
yet
confident
not
until
they
were
crossing
the
aisle
where
the
clearer
light
streamed
in
through
the
open
doors
did
joan
see
that
she
was
very
old
and
feeble
with
about
her
figure
that
curious
patient
droop
that
comes
to
the
she
proved
to
be
most
interesting
and
full
of
helpful
information
mary
stopperton
was
her
name
she
had
lived
in
the
neighbourhood
all
her
life
had
as
a
girl
worked
for
the
leigh
hunts
and
had
assisted
carlyle
she
had
been
very
frightened
of
the
great
man
himself
and
had
always
hidden
herself
behind
doors
or
squeezed
herself
into
corners
and
stopped
breathing
whenever
there
had
been
any
fear
of
meeting
him
upon
the
stairs
until
one
day
having
darted
into
a
cupboard
to
escape
from
him
and
drawn
the
door
to
after
her
it
turned
out
to
be
the
cupboard
in
which
carlyle
was
used
to
keep
his
boots
so
that
there
was
quite
a
struggle
between
them
she
holding
grimly
on
to
the
door
inside
and
carlyle
equally
determined
to
open
it
and
get
his
boots
it
had
ended
in
her
exposure
with
trembling
knees
and
scarlet
face
and
carlyle
had
addressed
her
as
woman
and
had
insisted
on
knowing
what
she
was
doing
there
and
after
that
she
had
lost
all
terror
of
him
and
he
had
even
allowed
her
with
a
grim
smile
to
enter
occasionally
the
sacred
study
with
her
broom
and
pan
it
had
evidently
made
a
lasting
impression
upon
her
that
privilege
they
did
get
on
very
well
together
and
mrs
carlyle
joan
queried
scenting
the
opportunity
of
obtaining
evidence
there
was
much
difference
so
far
as
i
could
see
between
them
and
most
of
us
answered
the
little
old
lady
you
not
married
dear
she
continued
glancing
at
joan
ungloved
hand
but
people
must
have
a
deal
of
patience
when
they
have
to
live
with
us
for
hours
a
day
you
see
little
things
we
do
and
say
without
thinking
and
little
ways
we
have
that
we
do
not
notice
ourselves
may
all
the
time
be
irritating
to
other
people
what
about
the
other
people
irritating
us
suggested
joan
yes
dear
and
of
course
that
can
happen
too
agreed
the
little
old
lady
did
he
carlyle
ever
come
to
this
church
asked
joan
mary
stopperton
was
afraid
he
never
had
in
spite
of
its
being
so
near
and
yet
he
was
a
dear
good
christian
in
his
way
mary
stopperton
felt
sure
how
do
you
mean
his
way
demanded
joan
it
certainly
if
froude
was
to
be
trusted
could
not
have
been
the
orthodox
way
well
you
see
dear
explained
the
little
old
lady
he
gave
up
things
he
could
have
ridden
in
his
carriage
she
was
quoting
it
seemed
the
words
of
the
carlyles
old
servant
if
he
written
the
sort
of
lies
that
people
pay
for
being
told
instead
of
throwing
the
truth
at
their
head
but
even
that
would
not
make
him
a
christian
argued
joan
it
is
part
of
it
dear
is
it
insisted
mary
stopperton
to
suffer
for
one
faith
i
think
jesus
must
have
liked
him
for
that
they
had
commenced
with
the
narrow
strip
of
burial
ground
lying
between
the
south
side
of
the
church
and
cheyne
walk
and
there
the
little
opener
had
showed
her
the
grave
of
anna
afterwards
spragg
who
long
declining
wedlock
and
aspiring
above
her
sex
fought
under
her
brother
with
arms
and
manly
attire
in
a
flagship
against
the
french
as
also
of
mary
astell
her
contemporary
who
had
written
a
spirited
essay
in
defence
of
the
fair
sex
so
there
had
been
a
suffrage
movement
as
far
back
as
in
the
days
of
pope
and
swift
returning
to
the
interior
joan
had
duly
admired
the
cheyne
monument
but
had
been
unable
to
disguise
her
amusement
before
the
tomb
of
colvile
whom
the
sculptor
had
represented
as
a
somewhat
impatient
lady
refusing
to
await
the
day
of
resurrection
but
pushing
through
her
coffin
and
starting
for
heaven
in
her
pausing
in
front
of
the
dacre
monument
joan
wondered
if
the
actor
of
that
name
who
had
committed
suicide
in
australia
and
whose
london
address
she
remembered
had
been
dacre
house
just
round
the
corner
was
descended
from
the
family
thinking
that
if
so
it
would
give
an
touch
to
the
article
she
had
fully
decided
now
to
write
it
but
mary
stopperton
could
not
inform
her
they
had
ended
up
in
the
chapel
of
sir
thomas
more
he
too
had
given
up
things
including
his
head
though
mary
stopperton
siding
with
father
morris
was
convinced
he
had
now
got
it
back
and
that
with
the
remainder
of
his
bones
it
rested
in
the
tomb
before
them
there
the
little
had
left
her
having
to
show
the
to
their
seats
and
joan
had
found
an
pew
from
where
she
could
command
a
view
of
the
whole
church
they
were
chiefly
poor
folk
the
congregation
with
here
and
there
a
sprinkling
of
faded
gentility
they
seemed
in
keeping
with
the
place
the
twilight
faded
and
a
snuffy
old
man
shuffled
round
and
lit
the
gas
it
was
all
so
sweet
and
restful
religion
had
never
appealed
to
her
before
the
service
in
the
bare
cold
chapel
where
she
had
sat
swinging
her
feet
and
yawning
as
a
child
had
only
repelled
her
she
could
recall
her
father
aloof
and
in
his
sunday
black
passing
round
the
bag
her
mother
always
veiled
sitting
beside
her
a
thin
tall
woman
with
passionate
eyes
and
ever
restless
hands
the
women
mostly
overdressed
and
the
sleek
prosperous
men
trying
to
look
meek
at
school
and
at
girton
chapel
which
she
had
attended
no
oftener
than
she
was
obliged
had
had
about
it
the
same
atmosphere
of
chill
compulsion
but
here
was
poetry
she
wondered
if
after
all
religion
might
not
have
its
place
in
the
world
in
company
with
the
other
arts
it
would
be
a
pity
for
it
to
die
out
there
seemed
nothing
to
take
its
place
all
these
lovely
cathedrals
these
dear
little
old
churches
that
for
centuries
had
been
the
focus
of
men
thoughts
and
aspirations
the
harbour
lights
illumining
the
troubled
waters
of
their
lives
what
could
be
done
with
them
they
could
hardly
be
maintained
out
of
the
public
funds
as
mere
mementoes
of
the
past
besides
there
were
too
many
of
them
the
would
naturally
grumble
as
town
halls
assembly
rooms
the
idea
was
unthinkable
it
would
be
like
a
performance
of
barnum
circus
in
the
coliseum
at
rome
yes
they
would
disappear
though
not
she
was
glad
to
think
in
her
time
in
towns
the
space
would
be
required
for
other
buildings
here
and
there
some
gradually
decaying
specimen
would
be
allowed
to
survive
taking
its
place
with
the
feudal
castles
and
walled
cities
of
the
continent
the
joy
of
the
american
tourist
the
of
the
antiquary
a
pity
yes
but
then
from
the
aesthetic
point
of
view
it
was
a
pity
that
the
groves
of
ancient
greece
had
ever
been
cut
down
and
replanted
with
currant
bushes
their
altars
scattered
that
the
stones
of
the
temples
of
isis
should
have
come
to
be
the
shelter
of
the
fisher
of
the
nile
and
the
corn
wave
in
the
wind
above
the
buried
shrines
of
mexico
all
these
dead
truths
that
from
time
to
time
had
encumbered
the
living
world
each
in
its
turn
had
had
to
be
cleared
away
and
yet
was
it
altogether
a
dead
truth
this
passionate
belief
in
a
personal
god
who
had
ordered
all
things
for
the
best
who
could
be
appealed
to
for
comfort
for
help
might
it
not
be
as
good
an
explanation
as
any
other
of
the
mystery
surrounding
us
it
had
been
so
universal
she
was
not
sure
where
but
somewhere
she
had
come
across
an
analogy
that
had
strongly
impressed
her
the
fact
that
a
man
feels
thirsty
though
at
the
time
he
may
be
wandering
through
the
desert
of
sahara
proves
that
somewhere
in
the
world
there
is
water
might
not
the
success
of
christianity
in
responding
to
human
needs
be
evidence
in
its
favour
the
love
of
god
the
fellowship
of
the
holy
ghost
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
were
not
all
human
needs
provided
for
in
that
one
comprehensive
promise
the
desperate
need
of
man
to
be
convinced
that
behind
all
the
seeming
muddle
was
a
loving
hand
guiding
towards
good
the
need
of
the
soul
in
its
loneliness
for
fellowship
for
strengthening
the
need
of
man
in
his
weakness
for
the
kindly
grace
of
human
sympathy
of
human
example
and
then
as
fate
would
have
it
the
first
lesson
happened
to
be
the
story
of
jonah
and
the
whale
half
a
dozen
shocked
faces
turned
suddenly
towards
her
told
joan
that
at
some
point
in
the
thrilling
history
she
must
unconsciously
have
laughed
fortunately
she
was
alone
in
the
pew
and
feeling
herself
scarlet
squeezed
herself
into
its
farthest
corner
and
drew
down
her
veil
no
it
would
have
to
go
a
religion
that
solemnly
demanded
of
grown
men
and
women
in
the
twentieth
century
that
they
should
sit
and
listen
with
reverential
awe
to
a
prehistoric
edition
of
grimm
fairy
stories
including
noah
and
his
ark
the
adventures
of
samson
and
delilah
the
conversations
between
balaam
and
his
ass
and
culminating
in
what
if
it
were
not
so
appallingly
wicked
an
idea
would
be
the
most
comical
of
them
all
the
conception
of
an
elaborately
organized
hell
into
which
the
god
of
the
christians
plunged
his
creatures
for
all
eternity
of
what
use
was
such
a
religion
as
that
going
to
be
to
the
world
of
the
future
she
must
have
knelt
and
stood
mechanically
for
the
service
was
ended
the
pulpit
was
occupied
by
an
elderly
man
with
a
troublesome
cough
but
one
sentence
he
had
let
fall
had
gripped
her
attention
for
a
moment
she
could
not
remember
it
and
then
it
came
to
her
all
roads
lead
to
calvary
it
struck
her
as
rather
good
perhaps
he
was
going
to
be
worth
listening
to
to
all
of
us
sooner
or
later
he
was
saying
comes
a
choosing
of
two
ways
either
the
road
leading
to
success
the
gratification
of
desires
the
honour
and
approval
of
our
or
the
path
to
calvary
and
then
he
had
wandered
off
into
a
maze
of
detail
the
tradesman
dreaming
perhaps
of
becoming
a
whiteley
having
to
choose
whether
to
go
forward
or
remain
for
all
time
in
the
little
shop
the
statesman
should
he
abide
by
the
faith
that
is
in
him
and
suffer
loss
of
popularity
or
renounce
his
god
and
enter
the
cabinet
the
artist
the
writer
the
mere
labourer
there
were
too
many
of
them
a
few
examples
would
have
sufficed
and
then
that
irritating
cough
and
yet
every
now
and
then
he
would
be
arresting
in
his
prime
joan
felt
he
must
have
been
a
great
preacher
even
now
decrepit
and
wheezy
he
was
capable
of
flashes
of
magnetism
of
eloquence
the
passage
where
he
pictured
the
garden
of
gethsemane
the
fair
jerusalem
only
hidden
from
us
by
the
shadows
so
easy
to
return
to
its
soft
lights
shining
through
the
trees
beckoning
to
us
its
mingled
voices
stealing
to
us
through
the
silence
whispering
to
us
of
its
ways
its
pleasant
places
its
open
doorways
friends
and
loved
ones
waiting
for
us
and
above
the
calvary
and
crowning
its
summit
clear
against
the
starlit
sky
the
cold
dark
cross
not
perhaps
to
us
the
bleeding
hands
and
feet
but
to
all
the
bitter
tears
our
calvary
may
be
a
very
little
hill
compared
with
the
mountains
where
prometheus
suffered
but
to
us
it
is
steep
and
lonely
there
he
should
have
stopped
it
would
have
been
a
good
note
on
which
to
finish
but
it
seemed
there
was
another
point
he
wished
to
make
even
to
the
sinner
calvary
calls
to
judas
even
to
him
the
gates
of
the
giving
garden
of
gethsemane
had
not
been
closed
with
his
thirty
pieces
of
silver
he
could
have
stolen
away
in
some
distant
crowded
city
of
the
roman
empire
have
lived
unknown
forgotten
life
still
had
its
pleasures
its
rewards
to
him
also
had
been
given
the
choice
the
thirty
pieces
of
silver
that
had
meant
so
much
to
him
he
flings
them
at
the
feet
of
his
tempters
they
would
not
take
them
back
he
rushes
out
and
hangs
himself
shame
and
death
with
his
own
hands
he
will
build
his
own
cross
none
to
help
him
he
too
even
judas
climbs
his
calvary
enters
into
the
fellowship
of
those
who
through
all
ages
have
trod
its
stony
pathway
joan
waited
till
the
last
of
the
congregation
had
disappeared
and
then
joined
the
little
who
was
waiting
to
close
the
doors
joan
asked
her
what
she
had
thought
of
the
sermon
but
mary
stopperton
being
a
little
deaf
had
not
heard
it
it
was
quite
good
the
matter
of
it
joan
told
her
all
roads
lead
to
calvary
the
idea
is
that
there
comes
a
time
to
all
of
us
when
we
have
to
choose
whether
like
your
friend
carlyle
we
will
up
for
our
faith
sake
or
go
for
the
carriage
and
pair
mary
stopperton
laughed
he
is
quite
right
dear
she
said
it
does
seem
to
come
and
it
is
so
hard
you
have
to
pray
and
pray
and
pray
and
even
then
we
can
not
always
do
it
she
touched
with
her
little
withered
fingers
joan
fine
white
hand
but
you
are
so
strong
and
brave
she
continued
with
another
little
laugh
it
wo
be
so
difficult
for
you
it
was
not
until
well
on
her
way
home
that
joan
recalling
the
conversation
found
herself
smiling
at
mary
stopperton
literal
acceptation
of
the
argument
at
the
time
she
remembered
the
shadow
of
a
fear
had
passed
over
her
mary
stopperton
did
not
know
the
name
of
the
preacher
it
was
quite
common
for
chance
substitutes
to
officiate
there
especially
in
the
evening
joan
had
insisted
on
her
acceptance
of
a
shilling
and
had
made
a
note
of
her
address
feeling
instinctively
that
the
little
old
woman
would
come
in
useful
from
a
journalistic
point
of
view
shaking
hands
with
her
she
had
turned
eastward
intending
to
walk
to
sloane
square
and
there
take
the
bus
at
the
corner
of
oakley
street
she
overtook
him
he
was
evidently
a
stranger
to
the
neighbourhood
and
was
peering
up
through
his
glasses
to
see
the
name
of
the
street
and
joan
caught
sight
of
his
face
beneath
a
gas
lamp
and
suddenly
it
came
to
her
that
it
was
a
face
she
knew
in
the
church
she
had
not
seen
him
clearly
he
was
still
peering
upward
joan
stole
another
glance
yes
she
had
met
him
somewhere
he
was
very
changed
quite
different
but
she
was
sure
of
it
it
was
a
long
time
ago
she
must
have
been
quite
a
child
chapter
ii
one
of
joan
earliest
recollections
was
the
picture
of
herself
standing
before
the
high
cheval
glass
in
her
mother
her
clothes
lay
scattered
far
and
wide
falling
where
she
had
flung
them
not
a
shred
of
any
kind
of
covering
was
left
to
her
she
must
have
been
very
small
for
she
could
remember
looking
up
and
seeing
high
above
her
head
the
two
brass
knobs
by
which
the
glass
was
fastened
to
its
frame
suddenly
out
of
the
upper
portion
of
the
glass
there
looked
a
scared
red
face
it
hovered
there
a
moment
and
over
it
in
swift
succession
there
passed
the
expressions
first
of
petrified
amazement
secondly
of
shocked
indignation
and
thirdly
of
righteous
wrath
and
then
it
swooped
down
upon
her
and
the
image
in
the
glass
became
a
confusion
of
small
naked
arms
and
legs
mingled
with
green
cotton
gloves
and
purple
bonnet
strings
you
young
imp
of
satan
demanded
munday
her
feelings
of
outraged
virtue
exaggerating
perhaps
her
real
sentiments
what
are
you
doing
go
away
looking
at
myself
had
explained
joan
struggling
furiously
to
regain
the
glass
but
where
are
your
clothes
was
munday
wonder
tooked
them
off
explained
joan
a
piece
of
information
that
really
all
things
considered
seemed
unnecessary
but
ca
you
see
yourself
you
wicked
child
without
stripping
yourself
as
naked
as
you
were
born
no
maintained
joan
stoutly
i
hate
clothes
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
did
even
in
those
early
days
on
the
contrary
one
of
her
favourite
amusements
was
dressing
up
this
sudden
overmastering
desire
to
arrive
at
the
truth
about
herself
had
been
a
new
conceit
i
wanted
to
see
myself
clothes
ai
me
was
all
she
would
or
could
vouchsafe
and
munday
had
shook
her
head
and
had
freely
confessed
that
there
were
things
beyond
her
and
that
joan
was
one
of
them
and
had
succeeded
partly
by
force
partly
by
persuasion
in
restoring
to
joan
once
more
the
semblance
of
a
christian
child
it
was
munday
poor
soul
who
all
unconsciously
had
planted
the
seeds
of
disbelief
in
joan
mind
munday
god
from
joan
point
of
view
was
a
most
objectionable
personage
he
talked
a
lot
or
rather
munday
talked
for
him
about
his
love
for
little
children
but
it
seemed
he
only
loved
them
when
they
were
good
joan
was
under
no
delusions
about
herself
if
those
were
his
terms
well
then
so
far
as
she
could
see
he
was
going
to
be
of
much
use
to
her
besides
if
he
hated
naughty
children
why
did
he
make
them
naughty
at
a
moderate
estimate
quite
half
joan
wickedness
so
it
seemed
to
joan
came
to
her
unbidden
take
for
example
that
before
the
cheval
glass
the
idea
had
come
into
her
mind
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
that
it
was
wicked
if
as
munday
explained
it
was
the
devil
that
had
whispered
it
to
her
then
what
did
god
mean
by
allowing
the
devil
to
go
about
persuading
little
girls
to
do
indecent
things
god
could
do
everything
why
did
he
smash
the
devil
it
seemed
to
joan
a
mean
trick
look
at
it
how
you
would
fancy
leaving
a
little
girl
to
fight
the
devil
all
by
herself
and
then
get
angry
because
the
devil
won
joan
came
to
cordially
dislike
munday
god
looking
back
it
was
easy
enough
to
smile
but
the
agony
of
many
nights
when
she
had
lain
awake
for
hours
battling
with
her
childish
terrors
had
left
a
burning
sense
of
anger
in
joan
heart
poor
mazed
bewildered
munday
preaching
the
eternal
damnation
of
the
wicked
who
had
loved
her
who
had
only
thought
to
do
her
duty
the
blame
was
not
hers
but
that
a
religion
capable
of
inflicting
such
suffering
upon
the
innocent
should
still
be
preached
maintained
by
the
state
that
its
educated
followers
no
longer
believed
in
a
physical
hell
that
its
more
advanced
clergy
had
entered
into
a
conspiracy
of
silence
on
the
subject
was
no
answer
the
great
mass
of
the
people
were
not
educated
official
christendom
in
every
country
still
preached
the
everlasting
torture
of
the
majority
of
the
human
race
as
a
well
thought
out
part
of
the
creator
scheme
no
leader
had
been
bold
enough
to
come
forward
and
denounce
it
as
an
insult
to
his
god
as
one
grew
older
kindly
mother
nature
ever
seeking
to
ease
the
burdens
of
her
foolish
brood
gave
one
forgetfulness
insensibility
the
condemned
criminal
puts
the
thought
of
the
gallows
away
from
him
as
long
as
may
be
eats
and
sleeps
and
even
jokes
man
soul
grows
pachydermoid
but
the
children
their
sensitive
brains
exposed
to
every
cruel
breath
no
philosophic
doubt
permitted
to
them
no
learned
disputation
on
the
relationship
between
the
literal
and
the
allegorical
for
the
easing
of
their
frenzied
fears
how
many
million
tiny
figures
scattered
over
christian
europe
and
america
stared
out
each
night
into
a
vision
of
black
horror
how
many
million
tiny
hands
clutched
wildly
at
the
bedclothes
the
society
for
the
prevention
of
cruelty
to
children
if
they
had
done
their
duty
would
have
prosecuted
before
now
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
of
course
she
would
go
to
hell
as
a
special
kindness
some
generous
relative
had
on
joan
seventh
birthday
given
her
an
edition
of
inferno
with
illustrations
by
dore
from
it
she
was
able
to
form
some
notion
of
what
her
eternity
was
likely
to
be
and
god
all
the
while
up
in
his
heaven
surrounded
by
that
glorious
band
of
angels
watching
her
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
her
courage
saved
her
from
despair
defiance
came
to
her
aid
let
him
send
her
to
hell
she
was
not
going
to
pray
to
him
and
make
up
to
him
he
was
a
wicked
god
yes
he
was
a
cruel
wicked
god
and
one
night
she
told
him
so
to
his
face
it
had
been
a
pretty
crowded
day
even
for
so
busy
a
sinner
as
little
joan
it
was
springtime
and
they
had
gone
into
the
country
for
her
mother
health
maybe
it
was
the
season
a
stirring
of
the
human
sap
conducing
to
that
feeling
of
being
too
big
for
one
boots
as
the
saying
is
a
dangerous
period
of
the
year
indeed
on
the
principle
that
prevention
is
better
than
cure
munday
had
made
it
a
custom
during
april
and
may
to
administer
to
joan
a
cooling
mixture
but
on
this
occasion
had
unfortunately
come
away
without
it
joan
dressed
for
use
rather
than
show
and
without
either
shoes
or
stockings
had
stolen
stealthily
downstairs
something
seemed
to
be
calling
to
her
silently
like
a
thief
in
the
night
to
adopt
metaphor
had
slipped
the
heavy
bolts
had
joined
the
thousand
creatures
of
the
wood
had
danced
and
leapt
and
shouted
had
behaved
in
short
more
as
if
she
had
been
a
pagan
nymph
than
a
happy
english
child
she
had
regained
the
house
unnoticed
as
she
thought
the
devil
no
doubt
assisting
her
and
had
hidden
her
wet
clothes
in
the
bottom
of
a
mighty
chest
deceitfulness
in
her
heart
she
had
greeted
munday
in
sleepy
tones
from
beneath
the
sheets
and
before
breakfast
assailed
by
suspicious
questions
had
told
a
deliberate
lie
later
in
the
morning
during
an
argument
with
an
active
young
pig
who
was
willing
enough
to
play
at
red
riding
hood
so
far
as
eating
things
out
of
a
basket
was
concerned
but
who
would
not
wear
a
she
had
used
a
wicked
word
in
the
afternoon
she
might
have
killed
the
farmer
only
son
and
heir
they
had
had
a
row
in
one
of
those
sad
lapses
from
the
higher
christian
standards
into
which
satan
was
always
egging
her
she
had
pushed
him
and
he
had
tumbled
head
over
heels
into
the
the
reason
that
instead
of
lying
there
and
drowning
he
had
got
up
and
walked
back
to
the
house
howling
fit
to
wake
the
seven
sleepers
was
that
god
watching
over
little
children
had
arranged
for
the
incident
taking
place
on
that
side
of
the
pond
where
it
was
shallow
had
the
scrimmage
occurred
on
the
opposite
bank
beneath
which
the
water
was
much
deeper
joan
in
all
probability
would
have
had
murder
on
her
soul
it
seemed
to
joan
that
if
god
and
had
been
so
careful
in
selecting
the
site
he
might
with
equal
ease
have
prevented
the
row
from
ever
taking
place
why
could
the
little
beast
have
been
guided
back
from
school
through
the
orchard
much
the
shorter
way
instead
of
being
brought
round
by
the
yard
so
as
to
come
upon
her
at
a
moment
when
she
was
feeling
a
bit
to
put
it
mildly
and
why
had
god
allowed
him
to
call
her
carrots
that
joan
should
have
put
it
this
way
instead
of
going
down
on
her
knees
and
thanking
the
lord
for
having
saved
her
from
a
crime
was
proof
of
her
inborn
evil
disposition
in
the
evening
was
reached
the
culminating
point
just
before
going
to
bed
she
had
murdered
old
george
the
cowman
for
all
practical
purposes
she
might
just
as
well
have
been
successful
in
drowning
william
augustus
earlier
in
the
day
it
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
things
that
had
to
be
hornflower
still
lived
it
was
true
but
that
was
not
joan
fault
joan
standing
in
white
beside
her
bed
everything
around
her
breathing
of
innocence
and
virtue
the
spotless
bedclothes
the
chintz
curtains
the
white
hyacinths
upon
the

bound

their
little
table

in

black
and
cameo
brooch
pale
red
with

and

in
white

sacred
to
the
memory
of
the
departed
munday
joan
standing
there
erect
with
pale
passionate
face
defying
all
these
aids
to
righteousness
had
deliberately
wished
hornflower
dead
old
george
hornflower
it
was
who
unseen
by
her
had
passed
her
that
morning
in
the
wood
grumpy
old
george
it
was
who
had
overheard
the
wicked
word
with
which
she
had
cursed
the
pig
who
had
met
william
augustus
on
his
emergence
from
the
pond
to
george
hornflower
the
humble
instrument
in
the
hands
of
providence
helping
her
towards
possible
salvation
she
ought
to
have
been
grateful
and
instead
of
that
she
had
flung
into
the
agonized
face
of
munday
these
awful
words
i
wish
he
was
dead
he
who
in
his
heart
there
was
verse
and
chapter
for
it
joan
was
a
murderess
just
as
well
so
far
as
joan
was
concerned
might
she
have
taken
a
and
stabbed
deacon
hornflower
to
the
heart
joan
prayers
that
night
to
the
accompaniment
of
munday
sobs
had
a
hopeless
air
of
unreality
about
them
munday
kiss
was
cold
how
long
joan
lay
and
tossed
upon
her
little
bed
she
could
not
tell
somewhere
about
the
middle
of
the
night
or
so
it
seemed
to
her
the
frenzy
seized
her
flinging
the
bedclothes
away
she
rose
to
her
feet
it
is
difficult
to
stand
upon
a
spring
mattress
but
joan
kept
her
balance
of
course
he
was
there
in
the
room
with
her
god
was
everywhere
spying
upon
her
she
could
distinctly
hear
his
measured
breathing
face
to
face
with
him
she
told
him
what
she
thought
of
him
she
told
him
he
was
a
cruel
wicked
god
there
are
no
victoria
crosses
for
sinners
or
surely
little
joan
that
night
would
have
earned
it
it
was
not
lack
of
imagination
that
helped
her
courage
god
and
she
alone
in
the
darkness
he
with
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
behind
him
he
armed
with
his
eternal
pains
and
penalties
and
joan
the
creature
that
he
had
made
in
his
own
image
that
he
could
torture
and
destroy
hell
yawned
beneath
her
but
it
had
to
be
said
somebody
ought
to
tell
him
you
are
a
wicked
god
joan
told
him
yes
you
are
a
cruel
wicked
god
and
then
that
she
might
not
see
the
walls
of
the
room
open
before
her
hear
the
wild
laughter
of
the
thousand
devils
that
were
coming
to
bear
her
off
she
threw
herself
down
her
face
hidden
in
the
pillow
and
clenched
her
hands
and
waited
and
suddenly
there
burst
a
song
it
was
like
nothing
joan
had
ever
heard
before
so
clear
and
loud
and
near
that
all
the
night
seemed
filled
with
harmony
it
sank
into
a
tender
yearning
cry
throbbing
with
passionate
desire
and
then
it
rose
again
in
thrilling
ecstasy
a
song
of
hope
of
victory
joan
trembling
stole
from
her
bed
and
drew
aside
the
blind
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
but
the
stars
and
the
dim
shape
of
the
hills
but
still
that
song
filling
the
air
with
its
wild
triumphant
melody
years
afterwards
listening
to
the
overture
to
there
came
back
to
her
the
memory
of
that
night
ever
through
the
mad
satanic
discords
she
could
hear
now
faint
now
conquering
the
pilgrims
onward
march
so
through
the
jangled
discords
of
the
world
one
heard
the
song
of
life
through
the
dim
aeons
of
man
savage
infancy
through
the
centuries
of
bloodshed
and
of
horror
through
the
dark
ages
of
tyranny
and
superstition
through
wrong
through
cruelty
through
hate
heedless
of
doom
heedless
of
death
still
the
nightingale
song
i
love
you
i
love
you
i
love
you
we
will
build
a
nest
we
will
rear
our
brood
i
love
you
i
love
you
life
shall
not
die
joan
crept
back
into
bed
a
new
wonder
had
come
to
her
and
from
that
night
joan
belief
in
munday
god
began
to
fade
circumstances
helping
firstly
there
was
the
great
event
of
going
to
school
she
was
glad
to
get
away
from
home
a
massive
stiffly
furnished
house
in
a
wealthy
suburb
of
liverpool
her
mother
since
she
could
remember
had
been
an
invalid
rarely
leaving
her
bedroom
till
the
afternoon
her
father
the
owner
of
large
engineering
works
she
only
saw
as
a
rule
at
when
she
would
come
down
to
dessert
it
had
been
different
when
she
was
very
young
before
her
mother
had
been
taken
then
she
had
been
more
with
them
both
she
had
dim
recollections
of
her
father
playing
with
her
pretending
to
be
a
bear
and
growling
at
her
from
behind
the
sofa
and
then
he
would
seize
and
hug
her
and
they
would
both
laugh
while
he
tossed
her
into
the
air
and
caught
her
he
had
looked
so
big
and
handsome
all
through
her
childhood
there
had
been
the
desire
to
recreate
those
days
to
spring
into
the
air
and
catch
her
arms
about
his
neck
she
could
have
loved
him
dearly
if
he
had
only
let
her
once
seeking
explanation
she
had
opened
her
heart
a
little
to
munday
it
was
disappointment
munday
thought
that
she
had
not
been
a
boy
and
with
that
joan
had
to
content
herself
maybe
also
her
mother
illness
had
helped
to
sadden
him
or
perhaps
it
was
mere
temperament
as
she
argued
to
herself
later
for
which
they
were
both
responsible
those
little
tricks
of
coaxing
of
tenderness
of
wilfulness
by
means
of
which
other
girls
wriggled
their
way
so
successfully
into
a
warm
nest
of
cosy
affection
she
had
never
been
able
to
employ
them
beneath
her
was
a
shyness
an
immovable
reserve
that
had
always
prevented
her
from
expressing
her
emotions
she
had
inherited
it
doubtless
enough
from
him
perhaps
one
day
between
them
they
would
break
down
the
barrier
the
strength
of
which
seemed
to
lie
in
its
very
flimsiness
its
impalpability
and
then
during
college
vacations
returning
home
with
growing
notions
and
views
of
her
own
she
had
found
herself
so
often
in
antagonism
with
him
his
fierce
puritanism
so
opposed
to
all
her
enthusiasms
arguing
with
him
she
might
almost
have
been
listening
to
one
of
his
cromwellian
ancestors
risen
from
the
dead
there
had
been
disputes
between
him
and
his
and
joan
had
taken
the
side
of
the
men
he
had
not
been
angry
with
her
but
coldly
contemptuous
and
yet
in
spite
of
it
all
if
he
had
only
made
a
sign
she
wanted
to
fling
herself
crying
into
his
arms
and
shake
him
make
him
listen
to
her
wisdom
sitting
on
his
knee
with
her
hands
clasped
round
his
neck
he
was
not
really
intolerant
and
stupid
that
had
been
proved
by
his
letting
her
go
to
a
church
of
england
school
her
mother
had
expressed
no
wish
it
was
he
who
had
selected
it
of
her
mother
she
had
always
stood
somewhat
in
fear
never
knowing
when
the
mood
of
passionate
affection
would
give
place
to
a
chill
aversion
that
seemed
almost
like
hate
perhaps
it
had
been
good
for
her
so
she
told
herself
in
after
years
her
lonely
unguided
childhood
it
had
forced
her
to
think
and
act
for
herself
at
school
she
reaped
the
benefit
confident
original
leadership
was
granted
to
her
as
a
natural
prerogative
nature
had
helped
her
nowhere
does
a
young
girl
rule
more
supremely
by
reason
of
her
beauty
than
among
her
fellows
joan
soon
grew
accustomed
to
having
her
boots
put
on
and
taken
off
for
her
all
her
needs
of
service
anticipated
by
eager
slaves
contending
with
one
another
for
the
privilege
by
giving
a
command
by
bestowing
a
few
moments
of
her
conversation
it
was
within
her
power
to
make
some
small
adoring
girl
absurdly
happy
for
the
rest
of
the
day
while
her
displeasure
would
result
in
tears
in
fawning
pleadings
for
forgiveness
the
homage
did
not
spoil
her
rather
it
helped
to
develop
her
she
accepted
it
from
the
beginning
as
in
the
order
of
things
power
had
been
given
to
her
it
was
her
duty
to
see
to
it
that
she
did
not
use
it
capriciously
for
her
own
gratification
no
conscientious
youthful
queen
could
have
been
more
careful
in
the
distribution
of
her
favours
that
they
should
be
for
the
encouragement
of
the
deserving
the
reward
of
virtue
more
sparing
of
her
frowns
reserving
them
for
the
rectification
of
error
at
girton
it
was
more
by
force
of
will
of
brain
that
she
had
to
make
her
position
there
was
more
competition
joan
welcomed
it
as
giving
more
zest
to
life
but
even
there
her
beauty
was
by
no
means
a
negligible
quantity
clever
brilliant
young
women
accustomed
to
sweep
aside
all
opposition
with
a
blaze
of
rhetoric
found
themselves
to
their
irritation
sitting
in
front
of
her
silent
not
so
much
listening
to
her
as
looking
at
her
it
puzzled
them
for
a
time
because
a
features
are
classical
and
her
colouring
attractive
surely
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
value
of
her
political
views
until
one
of
them
discovered
by
chance
that
it
has
well
what
does
beauty
think
about
it
this
one
had
asked
laughing
she
had
arrived
at
the
end
of
a
discussion
just
as
joan
was
leaving
the
room
and
then
she
gave
a
long
low
whistle
feeling
that
she
had
stumbled
upon
the
explanation
beauty
that
mysterious
force
that
from
the
date
of
creation
has
ruled
the
world
what
does
it
think
dumb
passive
as
a
rule
exercising
its
influence
unconsciously
but
if
it
should
become
intelligent
active
a
philosopher
has
dreamed
of
the
vast
influence
that
could
be
exercised
by
a
dozen
sincere
men
acting
in
unity
suppose
a
dozen
of
the
most
beautiful
women
in
the
world
could
form
themselves
into
a
league
joan
found
them
late
in
the
evening
still
discussing
it
her
mother
died
suddenly
during
her
last
term
and
joan
hurried
back
to
attend
the
funeral
her
father
was
out
when
she
reached
home
joan
changed
her
clothes
and
then
went
into
the
room
where
her
mother
lay
and
closed
the
door
she
must
have
been
a
beautiful
woman
now
that
the
fret
and
the
restlessness
had
left
her
it
had
come
back
to
her
the
passionate
eyes
were
closed
joan
kissed
the
marble
lids
and
drawing
a
chair
to
the
bedside
sat
down
it
grieved
her
that
she
had
never
loved
her
mother
not
as
one
ought
to
love
one
mother
unquestioningly
unreasoningly
as
a
natural
instinct
for
a
moment
a
strange
thought
came
to
her
and
swiftly
almost
guiltily
she
stole
across
and
drawing
back
a
corner
of
the
blind
examined
closely
her
own
features
in
the
glass
comparing
them
with
the
face
of
the
dead
woman
thus
called
upon
to
be
a
silent
witness
for
or
against
the
living
joan
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
and
let
fall
the
blind
there
could
be
no
misreading
the
evidence
death
had
smoothed
away
the
lines
given
back
youth
it
was
almost
uncanny
the
likeness
between
them
it
might
have
been
her
drowned
sister
lying
there
and
they
had
never
known
one
another
had
this
also
been
temperament
again
keeping
them
apart
why
did
it
imprison
us
each
one
as
in
a
moving
cell
so
that
we
never
could
stretch
out
our
arms
to
one
another
except
when
at
rare
intervals
love
or
death
would
unlock
for
a
while
the
key
impossible
that
two
beings
should
have
been
so
alike
in
feature
without
being
more
or
less
alike
in
thought
and
feeling
whose
fault
had
it
been
surely
her
own
she
was
so
hideously
calculating
even
munday
because
the
old
lady
had
been
fond
of
her
and
had
shown
it
had
been
of
more
service
to
her
more
a
companion
had
been
nearer
to
her
than
her
own
mother
in
she
recalled
the
two
or
three
occasions
when
she
had
tried
to
win
her
mother
but
fate
seemed
to
have
decreed
that
their
moods
should
never
correspond
her
mother
sudden
fierce
outbursts
of
love
when
she
would
be
jealous
exacting
almost
cruel
had
frightened
her
when
she
was
a
child
and
later
on
had
bored
her
other
daughters
would
have
shown
patience
unselfishness
but
she
had
always
been
so
why
had
she
never
fallen
in
love
like
other
girls
there
had
been
a
boy
at
brighton
when
she
was
at
school
there
quite
a
nice
boy
who
had
written
her
wildly
extravagant
it
must
have
cost
him
half
his
to
get
them
smuggled
in
to
her
why
had
she
only
been
amused
at
them
they
might
have
been
beautiful
if
only
one
had
read
them
with
sympathy
one
day
he
had
caught
her
alone
on
the
downs
evidently
he
had
made
it
his
business
to
hang
about
every
day
waiting
for
some
such
chance
he
had
gone
down
on
his
knees
and
kissed
her
feet
and
had
been
so
abject
so
pitiful
that
she
had
given
him
some
flowers
she
was
wearing
and
he
had
sworn
to
dedicate
the
rest
of
his
life
to
being
worthy
of
her
condescension
poor
lad
she
wondered
for
the
first
time
since
that
afternoon
what
had
become
of
him
there
had
been
others
a
third
cousin
who
still
wrote
to
her
from
egypt
sending
her
presents
that
perhaps
he
could
ill
afford
and
whom
she
answered
about
once
a
year
and
promising
young
men
she
had
met
at
cambridge
ready
she
felt
instinctively
to
fall
down
and
worship
her
and
all
the
use
she
had
had
for
them
was
to
convert
them
to
her
views
a
task
so
easy
as
to
be
quite
uninteresting
with
a
vague
idea
that
they
might
come
in
handy
in
the
future
when
she
might
need
help
in
shaping
that
world
of
the
future
only
once
had
she
ever
thought
of
marriage
and
that
was
in
favour
of
a
rheumatic
widower
with
three
children
a
professor
of
chemistry
very
learned
and
justly
famous
for
about
a
month
she
had
thought
herself
in
love
she
pictured
herself
devoting
her
life
to
him
rubbing
his
poor
left
shoulder
where
it
seemed
he
suffered
most
and
brushing
his
picturesque
hair
inclined
to
grey
fortunately
his
eldest
daughter
was
a
young
woman
of
resource
or
the
poor
gentleman
naturally
carried
off
his
feet
by
this
adoration
of
youth
and
beauty
might
have
made
an
ass
of
himself
but
apart
from
this
one
episode
she
had
reached
the
age
of
she
rose
and
replaced
the
chair
and
suddenly
a
wave
of
pity
passed
over
her
for
the
dead
woman
who
had
always
seemed
so
lonely
in
the
great
house
and
the
tears
came
she
was
glad
she
had
been
able
to
cry
she
had
always
hated
herself
for
her
lack
of
tears
it
was
so
unwomanly
even
as
a
child
she
had
rarely
cried
her
father
had
always
been
very
tender
very
patient
towards
her
mother
but
she
had
not
expected
to
find
him
so
changed
he
had
aged
and
his
shoulders
drooped
she
had
been
afraid
that
he
would
want
her
to
stay
with
him
and
take
charge
of
the
house
it
had
worried
her
considerably
it
would
be
so
difficult
to
refuse
and
yet
she
would
have
to
but
when
he
never
broached
the
subject
she
was
hurt
he
had
questioned
her
about
her
plans
the
day
after
the
funeral
and
had
seemed
only
anxious
to
assist
them
she
proposed
continuing
at
cambridge
till
the
end
of
the
term
she
had
taken
her
degree
the
year
before
after
that
she
would
go
to
london
and
commence
her
work
let
me
know
what
allowance
you
would
like
me
to
make
you
when
you
have
thought
it
out
things
are
not
what
they
were
at
the
works
but
there
will
always
be
enough
to
keep
you
in
comfort
he
had
told
her
she
had
fixed
it
there
and
then
at
two
hundred
a
year
she
would
not
take
more
and
that
only
until
she
was
in
a
position
to
keep
herself
i
want
to
prove
to
myself
she
explained
that
i
am
capable
of
earning
my
own
living
i
am
going
down
into
the
if
i
no
good
if
i
ca
take
care
of
even
one
poor
woman
i
come
back
and
ask
you
to
keep
me
she
was
sitting
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
and
laughing
she
drew
his
head
towards
her
and
pressed
it
against
her
if
i
succeed
if
i
am
strong
enough
to
fight
the
world
for
myself
and
win
that
will
mean
i
am
strong
enough
and
clever
enough
to
help
others
i
am
only
at
the
end
of
a
journey
when
you
need
me
he
had
answered
and
they
had
kissed
and
next
morning
she
returned
to
her
own
life
chapter
iii
it
was
at
madge
singleton
rooms
that
the
details
of
joan
entry
into
journalistic
london
were
arranged
the
coming
of
beauty
was
flora
lessing
phrase
for
designating
the
event
flora
lessing
known
among
her
associates
as
flossie
was
the
girl
who
at
cambridge
had
accidentally
stumbled
upon
the
explanation
of
joan
influence
in
appearance
she
was
of
the
fluffy
ruffles
type
with
childish
innocent
eyes
and
the
unruly
curls
beloved
of
the
novelist
at
the
first
these
latter
had
been
the
result
of
a
habit
of
late
rising
and
consequent
hurried
toilet
operations
but
on
the
discovery
that
for
the
purposes
of
her
profession
they
possessed
a
market
value
they
had
been
sedulously
cultivated
editors
of
the
old
order
had
ridiculed
the
idea
of
her
being
of
any
use
to
them
when
two
years
previously
she
had
by
combination
of
cheek
and
patience
forced
herself
into
their
sanctum
had
patted
her
paternally
upon
her
generally
ungloved
hand
and
told
her
to
go
back
home
and
get
some
honest
worthy
young
man
to
love
and
cherish
her
it
was
carleton
of
the
group
who
had
first
divined
her
possibilities
with
a
swift
glance
on
his
way
through
he
had
picked
her
out
from
a
line
of
men
and
women
ranged
against
the
wall
of
the
dark
entrance
passage
and
with
a
snap
of
his
fingers
had
beckoned
to
her
to
follow
him
striding
in
front
of
her
up
to
his
room
he
had
pointed
to
a
chair
and
had
left
her
sitting
there
for
of
an
hour
while
he
held
discussion
with
a
stream
of
subordinates
managers
and
editors
of
departments
who
entered
and
departed
one
after
another
evidently
in
order
all
of
them
spoke
rapidly
without
ever
digressing
by
a
single
word
from
the
point
giving
her
the
impression
of
their
speeches
having
been
rehearsed
beforehand
carleton
himself
never
interrupted
them
indeed
one
might
have
thought
he
was
not
listening
so
engrossed
he
appeared
to
be
in
the
pile
of
letters
and
telegrams
that
lay
waiting
for
him
on
his
desk
when
they
had
finished
he
would
ask
them
questions
still
with
his
attention
fixed
apparently
upon
the
paper
in
his
hand
then
looking
up
for
the
first
time
he
would
run
off
curt
instructions
much
in
the
tone
of
a
giving
orders
for
an
immediate
assault
and
finishing
abruptly
return
to
his
correspondence
when
the
last
as
it
transpired
had
closed
the
door
behind
him
he
swung
his
chair
round
and
faced
her
what
have
you
been
doing
he
asked
her
wasting
my
time
and
money
hanging
about
newspaper
offices
listening
to
silly
talk
from
old
fossils
she
told
him
and
having
learned
that
respectable
journalism
has
no
use
for
brains
you
come
to
me
he
answered
her
what
do
you
think
you
can
do
anything
that
can
be
done
with
a
pen
and
ink
she
told
him
interviewing
he
suggested
i
always
been
considered
good
at
asking
awkward
questions
she
assured
him
he
glanced
at
the
clock
i
give
you
five
minutes
he
said
interview
me
she
moved
to
a
chair
beside
the
desk
and
opening
her
bag
took
out
a
what
are
your
principles
she
asked
him
have
you
got
any
he
looked
at
her
sharply
across
the
corner
of
the
desk
i
mean
she
continued
to
what
fundamental
rule
of
conduct
do
you
attribute
your
success
she
leant
forward
fixing
her
eyes
on
him
do
tell
me
she
persisted
that
you
had
none
that
life
is
all
just
mere
blind
chance
think
of
the
young
men
who
are
hanging
on
your
answer
wo
you
send
them
a
message
yes
he
answered
musingly
it
your
baby
face
that
does
the
trick
in
the
ordinary
way
i
should
have
known
you
were
pulling
my
leg
and
have
shown
you
the
door
as
it
was
i
felt
half
inclined
for
the
moment
to
reply
with
some
damned
silly
platitude
that
would
have
set
all
fleet
street
laughing
at
me
why
do
my
interest
you
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
do
she
explained
but
it
what
people
talk
about
whenever
they
discuss
you
what
do
they
say
he
demanded
your
friends
that
you
never
had
any
and
your
enemies
that
they
are
always
the
latest
she
informed
him
you
do
he
answered
with
a
laugh
with
nine
men
out
of
ten
that
speech
would
have
ended
your
chances
you
sized
me
up
at
a
glance
and
knew
it
would
only
interest
me
and
your
instinct
is
right
he
added
what
people
are
saying
always
go
straight
for
that
he
gave
her
a
commission
then
and
there
for
a
heart
to
heart
talk
with
a
gentleman
whom
the
editor
of
the
home
news
department
of
the
would
have
referred
to
as
a
leading
literary
luminary
and
who
had
just
invented
a
new
world
in
two
volumes
she
had
asked
him
childish
questions
and
had
listened
with
eyes
while
he
sitting
over
against
her
and
smiling
benevolently
had
laid
bare
to
her
all
the
seeming
intricacies
of
creation
and
had
explained
to
her
in
simple
language
the
necessary
alterations
and
improvements
he
was
hoping
to
bring
about
in
human
nature
he
had
the
sensation
that
his
hair
must
be
standing
on
end
the
next
morning
after
having
read
in
cold
print
what
he
had
said
expanding
oneself
before
the
admiring
gaze
of
innocent
simplicity
and
addressing
the
easily
amused
ear
of
an
unsympathetic
public
are
not
the
same
thing
he
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
it
consoled
him
later
that
he
was
not
the
only
victim
the
became
famous
for
its
piquant
interviews
especially
with
elderly
celebrities
of
the
masculine
gender
it
dirty
work
flossie
confided
one
day
to
madge
singleton
i
trade
on
my
silly
face
do
see
that
i
much
different
to
any
of
these
poor
devils
they
were
walking
home
in
the
evening
from
a
theatre
if
i
had
been
stony
broke
i
never
have
taken
it
up
i
shall
get
out
of
it
as
soon
as
i
can
afford
to
i
should
make
it
a
bit
sooner
than
that
suggested
the
elder
woman
one
ca
always
stop
oneself
just
where
one
wants
to
when
sliding
down
a
slope
it
has
a
knack
of
getting
steeper
and
steeper
as
one
goes
on
madge
had
asked
joan
to
come
a
little
earlier
so
that
they
could
have
a
chat
together
before
the
others
arrived
i
only
asked
a
few
she
explained
as
she
led
joan
into
the
restful
that
looked
out
upon
the
gardens
madge
shared
a
set
of
chambers
in
gray
inn
with
her
brother
who
was
an
actor
but
i
have
chosen
them
with
care
joan
murmured
her
thanks
i
have
asked
any
men
she
added
as
she
fixed
joan
in
an
easy
chair
before
the
fire
i
was
afraid
of
its
introducing
the
wrong
element
tell
me
asked
joan
am
i
likely
to
meet
with
much
of
that
sort
of
thing
oh
about
as
much
as
there
always
is
wherever
men
and
women
work
together
answered
madge
it
a
nuisance
but
it
has
to
be
faced
nature
appears
to
have
only
one
idea
in
her
head
she
continued
after
a
pause
so
far
as
we
men
and
women
are
concerned
she
been
kinder
to
the
lower
animals
man
has
more
interests
joan
argued
a
thousand
other
allurements
to
distract
him
we
must
cultivate
his
finer
instincts
it
does
seem
to
answer
grumbled
madge
one
is
always
told
it
is
the
artist
the
brain
worker
the
very
men
who
have
these
fine
instincts
who
are
the
most
sexual
she
made
a
little
impatient
movement
with
her
hands
that
was
characteristic
of
her
personally
i
like
men
she
went
on
it
is
so
splendid
the
way
they
enjoy
life
just
like
a
dog
does
whether
it
wet
or
fine
we
are
always
blinking
up
at
the
clouds
and
worrying
about
our
hat
it
would
be
so
nice
to
be
able
to
have
friendship
with
them
i
do
mean
that
it
all
their
fault
she
continued
we
do
all
we
can
to
attract
them
the
way
we
dress
who
was
it
said
that
to
every
woman
every
man
is
a
potential
lover
we
ca
get
it
out
of
our
minds
it
there
even
when
we
do
know
it
we
will
never
succeed
in
civilizing
nature
we
wo
despair
of
her
laughed
joan
she
creeping
up
poor
lady
as
whistler
said
of
her
we
have
passed
the
phase
when
everything
she
did
was
right
in
our
childish
eyes
now
we
dare
to
criticize
her
that
shows
we
are
growing
up
she
will
learn
from
us
later
on
she
a
dear
old
thing
at
heart
she
been
kind
enough
to
you
replied
madge
somewhat
irrelevantly
there
was
a
note
of
irritation
in
her
tone
i
suppose
you
know
you
are
supremely
beautiful
you
seem
so
indifferent
to
it
i
wonder
sometimes
if
you
do
i
not
indifferent
to
it
answered
joan
i
reckoning
on
it
to
help
me
why
not
she
continued
with
a
flash
of
defiance
though
madge
had
not
spoken
it
is
a
weapon
like
any
other
knowledge
intellect
courage
god
has
given
me
beauty
i
shall
use
it
in
his
service
they
formed
a
curious
physical
contrast
these
two
women
in
this
moment
joan
radiant
serene
sat
upright
in
her
chair
her
head
slightly
thrown
back
her
fine
hands
clasping
one
another
so
strongly
that
the
delicate
muscles
could
be
traced
beneath
the
smooth
white
skin
madge
with
puckered
brows
leant
forward
in
a
crouching
attitude
her
thin
nervous
hands
stretched
out
towards
the
fire
how
does
one
know
when
one
is
serving
god
she
asked
after
a
pause
apparently
rather
of
herself
than
of
joan
it
seems
so
difficult
one
feels
it
explained
joan
yes
but
did
they
all
feel
it
madge
suggested
she
still
seemed
to
be
arguing
with
herself
rather
than
with
joan
nietzsche
i
have
been
reading
him
they
are
forming
a
nietzsche
society
to
give
lectures
about
him
propagate
him
over
here
eleanor
in
it
up
to
the
neck
it
seems
to
me
awful
every
fibre
in
my
being
revolts
against
him
yet
all
cocksure
that
he
is
the
coming
prophet
he
must
have
convinced
himself
that
he
is
serving
god
if
i
were
a
fighter
i
should
feel
i
was
serving
god
trying
to
down
him
how
do
i
know
which
of
us
is
right
torquemada
calvin
she
went
on
without
giving
joan
the
chance
of
a
reply
it
easy
enough
to
see
they
were
wrong
now
but
at
the
time
millions
of
people
believed
in
them
felt
it
was
god
voice
speaking
through
them
joan
of
arc
fancy
dying
to
put
a
thing
like
that
upon
a
throne
it
would
be
funny
if
it
was
so
tragic
you
can
say
she
drove
out
the
english
saved
france
but
for
what
the
bartholomew
massacres
the
ruin
of
the
palatinate
by
louis
xiv
the
horrors
of
the
french
revolution
ending
with
napoleon
and
all
the
misery
and
degeneracy
that
he
bequeathed
to
europe
history
might
have
worked
itself
out
so
much
better
if
the
poor
child
had
left
it
alone
and
minded
her
sheep
would
that
train
of
argument
lead
to
nobody
ever
doing
anything
suggested
joan
i
suppose
it
would
mean
stagnation
admitted
madge
and
yet
i
know
are
there
not
forces
moving
towards
right
that
are
crying
to
us
to
help
them
not
by
violence
which
only
interrupts
delays
them
but
by
quietly
preparing
the
way
for
them
you
know
what
i
mean
erasmus
always
said
that
luther
had
hindered
the
reformation
by
stirring
up
passion
and
hate
she
broke
off
suddenly
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
oh
if
god
would
only
say
what
he
wants
of
us
she
almost
cried
call
to
us
in
trumpet
tones
that
would
ring
through
the
world
compelling
us
to
take
sides
why
ca
he
speak
he
does
answered
joan
i
hear
his
voice
there
are
things
i
got
to
do
wrongs
that
i
must
fight
against
rights
that
i
must
never
dare
to
rest
till
they
are
won
her
lips
were
parted
her
breasts
heaving
he
does
call
to
us
he
has
girded
his
sword
upon
me
madge
looked
at
her
in
silence
for
quite
a
while
how
confident
you
are
she
said
how
i
envy
you
they
talked
for
a
time
about
domestic
matters
joan
had
established
herself
in
furnished
rooms
in
a
quiet
street
of
pleasant
georgian
houses
just
behind
the
abbey
a
member
of
parliament
and
his
wife
occupied
the
lower
floors
the
landlord
a
retired
butler
and
his
wife
an
excellent
cook
confining
themselves
to
the
basement
and
the
attics
the
remaining
floor
was
tenanted
by
a
shy
young
man
a
poet
so
the
landlady
thought
but
was
not
sure
anyhow
he
had
long
hair
lived
with
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
burned
his
lamp
long
into
the
night
joan
had
omitted
to
ask
his
name
she
made
a
note
to
do
so
they
discussed
ways
and
means
joan
calculated
she
could
get
through
on
two
hundred
a
year
putting
aside
fifty
for
dress
madge
was
doubtful
if
this
would
be
sufficient
joan
urged
that
she
was
stock
size
and
would
be
able
to
pick
up
models
at
sales
but
madge
measuring
her
against
herself
was
sure
she
was
too
full
you
will
find
yourself
expensive
to
dress
she
told
her
cheap
things
wo
go
well
on
you
and
it
would
be
madness
even
from
a
business
point
of
view
for
you
not
to
make
the
best
of
yourself
men
stand
more
in
awe
of
a
woman
than
they
do
even
of
a
beautiful
woman
madge
was
of
opinion
if
you
go
into
an
office
looking
dowdy
they
beat
you
down
tell
them
the
price
they
are
offering
you
wo
keep
you
in
gloves
for
a
week
and
they
be
ashamed
of
themselves
there
nothing
in
being
mean
to
the
poor
but
not
to
sympathize
with
the
rich
stamps
you
as
middle
class
she
laughed
joan
was
worried
i
told
dad
i
should
only
ask
him
for
enough
to
make
up
two
hundred
a
year
she
explained
he
laugh
at
me
for
not
knowing
my
own
mind
i
should
let
him
advised
madge
she
grew
thoughtful
again
we
cranky
young
women
with
our
independent
ways
i
guess
we
hurt
the
old
folks
quite
enough
as
it
is
the
bell
rang
and
madge
opened
the
door
herself
it
turned
out
to
be
flossie
joan
had
not
seen
her
since
they
had
been
at
girton
together
and
was
surprised
at
flossie
youthful
get
up
flossie
explained
and
without
waiting
for
any
possible
attack
flew
to
her
own
defence
the
revolution
that
the
world
is
waiting
for
was
flossie
opinion
is
the
providing
of
every
man
and
woman
with
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
then
we
shall
all
be
able
to
afford
to
be
noble
and
as
it
is
of
the
contemptible
things
we
do
comes
from
the
necessity
of
our
having
to
earn
our
living
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
would
deliver
us
from
evil
would
there
not
still
be
the
diamond
and
the
motor
car
left
to
tempt
us
suggested
madge
only
the
really
wicked
contended
flossie
it
would
classify
us
we
should
know
then
which
were
the
sheep
and
which
the
goats
at
present
we
all
jumbled
together
the
ungodly
who
sin
out
of
mere
greed
and
rapacity
and
the
just
men
compelled
to
sell
their
birthright
of
fine
instincts
for
a
mess
of
meat
and
potatoes
yah
socialist
commented
madge
who
was
busy
with
the
tea
things
flossie
seemed
struck
by
an
idea
by
jove
she
exclaimed
why
did
i
never
think
of
it
with
a
red
flag
and
my
hair
down
i
be
in
all
the
illustrated
papers
it
would
put
up
my
price
no
end
and
i
be
able
to
get
out
of
this
silly
job
of
mine
i
ca
go
on
much
longer
i
getting
too
well
known
i
do
believe
try
it
the
shouting
easy
enough
she
turned
to
joan
are
you
going
to
take
up
socialism
she
demanded
i
may
answered
joan
just
to
spank
it
and
put
it
down
again
rather
a
believer
in
temptation
the
struggle
for
existence
i
only
want
to
make
it
a
finer
existence
more
worth
the
struggle
in
which
the
best
man
shall
rise
to
the
top
your
security
that
will
be
the
last
act
of
the
human
drama
the
cue
for
ringing
down
the
curtain
but
do
not
all
our
isms
work
towards
that
end
suggested
madge
joan
was
about
to
reply
when
the
maid
announcement
of
denton
postponed
the
discussion
denton
was
a
short
lady
her
large
strong
features
must
have
made
her
when
she
was
young
a
woman
but
time
and
sorrow
had
strangely
softened
them
while
about
the
corners
of
the
thin
firm
mouth
lurked
a
suggestion
of
humour
that
possibly
had
not
always
been
there
joan
waiting
to
be
introduced
towered
head
and
shoulders
above
her
yet
when
she
took
the
small
proffered
hand
and
felt
those
steely
blue
eyes
surveying
her
she
had
the
sensation
of
being
quite
insignificant
denton
seemed
to
be
reading
her
and
then
still
retaining
joan
hand
she
turned
to
madge
with
a
smile
so
this
is
our
new
recruit
she
said
she
is
come
to
bring
healing
to
the
sad
sick
world
to
right
all
the
old
old
wrongs
she
patted
joan
hand
and
spoke
gravely
that
is
right
dear
that
is
youth
to
take
the
banner
from
our
failing
hands
bear
it
still
a
little
onward
her
small
gloved
hand
closed
on
joan
with
a
pressure
that
made
joan
wince
and
you
must
not
despair
she
continued
because
in
the
end
it
will
seem
to
you
that
you
have
failed
it
is
the
fallen
that
win
the
victories
she
released
joan
hand
abruptly
come
and
see
me
morning
at
my
office
she
said
we
will
fix
up
something
that
shall
be
serviceable
to
us
both
madge
flashed
joan
a
look
she
considered
joan
position
already
secured
denton
was
the
doyen
of
women
journalists
she
edited
a
monthly
review
and
was
leader
writer
of
one
of
the
most
important
dailies
besides
being
the
controlling
spirit
of
various
social
movements
anyone
she
took
up
would
be
assured
of
steady
work
the
pay
might
not
be
able
to
compete
with
the
prices
paid
for
more
popular
journalism
but
it
would
afford
a
foundation
and
give
to
joan
that
opportunity
for
influence
which
was
her
main
ambition
joan
expressed
her
thanks
she
would
like
to
have
had
more
talk
with
the
stern
old
lady
but
was
prevented
by
the
entrance
of
two
new
comers
the
first
was
miss
lavery
a
handsome
young
woman
she
ran
a
nursing
paper
but
her
chief
interest
was
in
the
woman
suffrage
question
just
then
coming
rapidly
to
the
front
she
had
heard
joan
speak
at
cambridge
and
was
eager
to
secure
her
adherence
being
wishful
to
surround
herself
with
a
group
of
young
and
women
who
should
take
the
movement
out
of
the
hands
of
the
frumps
as
she
termed
them
her
doubt
was
whether
joan
would
prove
sufficiently
tractable
she
intended
to
offer
her
remunerative
work
upon
the
without
saying
anything
about
the
real
motive
behind
trusting
to
gratitude
to
make
her
task
the
easier
the
second
was
a
overdressed
woman
whom
miss
lavery
introduced
as
phillips
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
who
is
going
to
be
helpful
to
us
all
adding
in
a
hurried
aside
to
madge
i
simply
had
to
bring
her
will
explain
to
you
another
time
an
apology
certainly
seemed
to
be
needed
the
woman
was
absurdly
out
of
her
place
she
stood
there
panting
and
slightly
perspiring
she
was
short
and
fat
with
dyed
hair
as
a
girl
she
had
possibly
been
pretty
in
a
dimpled
giggling
sort
of
way
joan
judged
her
in
spite
of
her
complexion
to
be
about
forty
joan
wondered
if
she
could
be
the
wife
of
the
member
of
parliament
who
occupied
the
rooms
below
her
in
cowley
street
his
name
so
the
landlady
had
told
her
was
phillips
she
put
the
suggestion
in
a
whisper
to
flossie
quite
likely
thought
flossie
just
the
type
that
sort
of
man
does
marry
a
barmaid
i
expect
others
continued
to
arrive
until
altogether
there
must
have
been
about
a
dozen
women
present
one
of
them
turned
out
to
be
an
old
schoolfellow
of
joan
and
two
had
been
with
her
at
girton
madge
had
selected
those
who
she
knew
would
be
sympathetic
and
all
promised
help
those
who
could
not
give
it
direct
undertaking
to
provide
introductions
and
recommendations
though
some
of
them
were
frankly
doubtful
of
journalism
affording
joan
anything
more
than
the
means
not
always
too
honest
of
earning
a
living
i
started
out
to
preach
the
gospel
all
that
sort
of
thing
drawled
a
miss
simmonds
from
beneath
a
hat
that
if
she
had
paid
for
it
would
have
cost
her
five
guineas
now
my
chief
purpose
in
life
is
to
tickle
silly
women
into
spending
twice
as
much
upon
their
clothes
as
their
husbands
can
afford
bamboozling
them
into
buying
any
old
thing
that
our
advertising
manager
instructs
me
to
boom
they
talk
about
the
editor
opinions
struck
in
a
fiery
little
woman
who
was
busy
flinging
crumbs
out
of
the
window
to
a
crowd
of
noisy
sparrows
it
the
advertiser
edits
half
the
papers
write
anything
that
three
of
them
object
to
and
your
proprietor
tells
you
to
change
your
convictions
or
go
most
of
us
change
she
jerked
down
the
window
with
a
slam
it
the
syndicates
that
have
done
it
was
a
elliot
opinion
she
wrote
society
notes
for
a
labour
weekly
when
one
man
owned
a
paper
he
wanted
it
to
express
his
views
a
company
is
only
out
for
profit
your
modern
newspaper
is
just
a
shop
it
only
purpose
is
to
attract
customers
look
at
the
owned
by
the
same
syndicate
of
jews
that
runs
the
they
work
it
as
far
as
possible
with
the
same
staff
we
a
pack
of
hirelings
asserted
the
fiery
little
woman
our
pens
are
for
sale
to
the
highest
bidder
i
had
a
letter
from
jocelyn
only
two
days
ago
he
was
one
of
the
original
staff
of
the
he
writes
me
that
he
has
gone
as
leader
writer
to
a
conservative
paper
at
twice
his
former
salary
expected
me
to
congratulate
him
one
of
these
days
somebody
will
start
a
society
for
the
reformation
of
the
press
thought
flossie
i
wonder
how
the
papers
will
take
it
much
as
rome
took
savonarola
thought
madge
denton
had
risen
they
are
right
to
a
great
extent
she
said
to
joan
but
not
all
the
temple
has
been
given
over
to
the
hucksters
you
shall
place
your
preaching
stool
in
some
quiet
corner
where
the
passing
feet
shall
pause
awhile
to
listen
her
going
was
the
signal
for
the
breaking
up
of
the
party
in
a
short
time
joan
and
madge
found
themselves
left
with
only
flossie
what
on
earth
induced
helen
to
bring
that
poor
old
dutch
doll
along
with
her
demanded
flossie
the
woman
never
opened
her
mouth
all
the
time
did
she
tell
you
no
answered
madge
but
i
think
i
can
guess
she
hopes
or
perhaps
would
be
more
correct
that
her
husband
is
going
to
join
the
cabinet
and
is
trying
to
fit
herself
by
suddenly
studying
political
and
social
questions
for
a
month
she
been
clinging
like
a
leech
to
helen
lavery
who
takes
her
to
meetings
and
gatherings
i
suppose
struck
up
some
sort
of
a
bargain
it
rather
pathetic
good
heavens
what
a
tragedy
for
the
man
commented
flossie
what
is
he
like
asked
joan
not
much
to
look
at
if
that
what
you
mean
answered
madge
began
life
as
a
miner
i
believe
looks
like
ending
as
prime
minister
i
heard
him
at
the
albert
hall
last
week
said
flossie
he
quite
wonderful
in
what
way
questioned
joan
oh
you
know
explained
flossie
like
a
volcano
compressed
into
a
steam
engine
they
discussed
joan
plans
it
looked
as
if
things
were
going
to
be
easy
for
her
chapter
iv
yet
in
the
end
it
was
carleton
who
opened
the
door
for
her
denton
was
helpful
and
would
have
been
more
so
if
joan
had
only
understood
denton
lived
alone
in
an
old
house
in
gower
street
with
a
high
stone
hall
that
was
always
echoing
to
sounds
that
no
one
but
itself
could
ever
hear
her
son
had
settled
it
was
supposed
in
one
of
the
colonies
no
one
knew
what
had
become
of
him
and
denton
herself
never
spoke
of
him
while
her
daughter
on
whom
she
had
centred
all
her
remaining
hopes
had
died
years
ago
to
those
who
remembered
the
girl
with
her
weak
eyes
and
wispy
ginger
coloured
hair
it
would
have
seemed
comical
the
idea
that
joan
resembled
her
but
memory
had
lost
itself
in
dreams
and
to
her
the
likeness
had
appeared
quite
wonderful
the
gods
had
given
her
child
back
to
her
grown
strong
and
brave
and
clever
life
would
have
a
new
meaning
for
her
her
work
would
not
die
with
her
she
thought
she
could
harness
joan
enthusiasm
to
her
own
wisdom
she
would
warn
her
of
the
errors
and
pitfalls
into
which
she
herself
had
fallen
for
she
too
had
started
as
a
rebel
youth
should
begin
where
age
left
off
had
the
old
lady
remembered
a
faded
volume
labelled
oddments
that
for
many
years
had
rested
undisturbed
upon
its
shelf
in
her
great
library
and
opening
it
had
turned
to
the
letter
e
she
would
have
read
recorded
there
in
her
own
precise
thin
penmanship
this
very
wise
reflection
experience
is
a
book
that
all
men
write
but
no
man
reads
to
which
she
would
have
found
added
by
way
of
complement
experience
is
untranslatable
we
write
it
in
the
cipher
of
our
sufferings
and
the
key
is
hidden
in
our
memories
and
turning
to
the
letter
y
she
might
have
read
youth
comes
to
teach
age
remains
to
listen
and
underneath
the
following
the
ability
to
learn
is
the
last
lesson
we
acquire
denton
had
long
ago
given
up
the
practice
of
jotting
down
her
thoughts
experience
having
taught
her
that
so
often
when
one
comes
to
use
them
one
finds
that
one
has
changed
them
but
in
the
case
of
joan
the
recollection
of
these
twin
oddments
might
have
saved
her
disappointment
joan
knew
of
a
new
road
that
avoided
pitfalls
she
grew
impatient
of
being
perpetually
pulled
back
for
the
she
wrote
a
series
of
condensed
biographies
entitled
ladies
of
the
lamp
commencing
with
elizabeth
fry
they
formed
a
record
of
good
women
who
had
battled
for
the
weak
and
suffering
winning
justice
for
even
the
uninteresting
miss
lavery
was
delighted
with
them
but
when
joan
proposed
exposing
the
neglect
and
even
cruelty
too
often
inflicted
upon
the
helpless
patients
of
private
nursing
homes
miss
lavery
shook
her
head
i
know
she
said
one
does
hear
complaints
about
them
unfortunately
it
is
one
of
the
few
businesses
managed
entirely
by
women
and
just
now
in
particular
if
we
were
to
say
anything
it
would
be
made
use
of
by
our
enemies
to
injure
the
cause
there
was
a
summer
years
ago
it
came
back
to
joan
mind
when
she
had
shared
lodgings
with
a
girl
chum
at
a
crowded
the
rooms
were
shockingly
dirty
and
tired
of
dropping
hints
she
determined
one
morning
to
clean
them
herself
she
climbed
a
chair
and
started
on
a
row
of
shelves
where
lay
the
dust
of
ages
it
was
a
built
house
and
the
result
was
that
she
brought
the
whole
lot
down
about
her
head
together
with
a
quarter
of
a
of
plaster
yes
i
thought
you
do
some
mischief
had
commented
the
landlady
wearily
it
seemed
typical
a
world
apparently
with
the
best
intentions
it
seemed
impossible
to
move
in
it
without
doing
more
harm
than
good
to
it
bringing
things
down
about
one
that
one
had
not
intended
she
wanted
to
abolish
steel
she
had
heard
the
little
beggars
cry
it
had
struck
her
as
such
a
harmless
reform
but
they
told
her
there
were
worthy
people
in
the
neighbourhood
of
wolverhampton
quite
a
number
of
them
who
made
their
living
by
the
manufacture
of
steel
if
thinking
only
of
the
rabbits
you
prohibited
steel
then
you
condemned
all
these
worthy
people
to
slow
starvation
the
local
mayor
himself
wrote
in
answer
to
her
article
he
drew
a
moving
picture
of
the
sad
results
that
might
follow
such
an
considered
agitation
hundreds
of
men
too
old
to
learn
new
jobs
begging
from
door
to
door
shoals
of
little
children
and
pinched
sobbing
women
her
editor
was
sorry
for
the
rabbits
had
often
spent
a
pleasant
day
with
them
himself
but
after
all
the
human
race
claimed
our
first
sympathies
she
wanted
to
abolish
sweating
she
had
climbed
the
rotting
stairways
seen
the
famished
creatures
in
their
holes
but
it
seemed
that
if
you
interfered
with
the
complicated
system
based
on
sweating
then
you
dislocated
the
entire
structure
of
the
british
export
clothing
trade
not
only
would
these
poor
creatures
lose
their
admittedly
wretched
living
but
still
a
living
but
thousands
of
other
innocent
victims
would
also
be
involved
in
the
common
ruin
all
very
sad
but
half
a
loaf
or
even
let
us
frankly
say
a
thin
slice
is
better
than
no
bread
at
all
she
wanted
board
school
children
heads
examined
she
had
examined
one
or
two
herself
it
seemed
to
her
wrong
that
healthy
children
should
be
compelled
to
sit
for
hours
within
jumping
distance
of
the
diseased
she
thought
it
better
that
the
dirty
should
be
made
fit
company
for
the
clean
than
the
clean
should
be
brought
down
to
the
level
of
the
dirty
it
seemed
that
in
doing
this
you
were
destroying
the
independence
of
the
poor
opposition
reformers
in
letters
scintillating
with
paradox
bristling
with
classical
allusion
denounced
her
attempt
to
impose
class
ideals
upon
a
too
long
suffering
proletariat
better
far
a
few
lively
little
heads
than
a
people
robbed
of
their
parental
rights
through
miss
lavery
she
obtained
an
introduction
to
the
great
sir
william
he
owned
a
group
of
popular
provincial
newspapers
and
was
most
encouraging
sir
william
had
often
said
to
himself
what
can
i
do
for
god
who
has
done
so
much
for
me
it
seemed
only
fair
he
asked
her
down
to
his
little
place
in
hampshire
to
talk
plans
over
the
little
place
it
turned
out
ran
to
forty
bedrooms
and
was
surrounded
by
three
hundred
acres
of
park
god
had
evidently
done
his
bit
quite
handsomely
it
was
in
a
secluded
corner
of
the
park
that
sir
william
had
gone
down
upon
one
knee
and
gallantly
kissed
her
hand
his
idea
was
that
if
she
could
regard
herself
as
his
dear
lady
and
allow
him
the
honour
and
privilege
of
being
her
true
knight
that
between
them
they
might
accomplish
something
really
useful
there
had
been
some
difficulty
about
his
getting
up
again
sir
william
being
an
elderly
gentleman
subject
to
rheumatism
and
joan
had
had
to
expend
no
small
amount
of
muscular
effort
in
assisting
him
so
that
the
episode
which
should
have
been
symbolical
ended
by
leaving
them
both
red
and
breathless
he
referred
to
the
matter
again
the
same
evening
in
the
library
while
lady
william
slept
peacefully
in
the
blue
but
as
it
appeared
necessary
that
the
compact
should
be
sealed
by
a
knightly
kiss
joan
had
failed
to
ratify
it
she
blamed
herself
on
her
way
home
the
poor
old
gentleman
could
easily
have
been
kept
in
his
place
the
suffering
of
an
occasional
harmless
caress
would
have
purchased
for
her
power
and
opportunity
had
it
not
been
somewhat
selfish
of
her
should
she
write
to
him
see
him
again
she
knew
that
she
never
would
it
was
something
apart
from
her
reason
it
would
not
even
listen
to
her
it
bade
or
forbade
as
if
one
were
a
child
without
any
right
to
a
will
of
one
own
it
was
decidedly
exasperating
there
were
others
there
were
the
editors
who
frankly
told
her
that
the
business
of
a
newspaper
was
to
write
what
its
customers
wanted
to
read
and
that
the
public
so
far
as
they
could
judge
was
just
about
fed
up
with
plans
for
new
jerusalems
at
their
expense
and
the
editors
who
were
prepared
to
take
up
any
number
of
reforms
insisting
only
that
they
should
be
new
and
original
and
promise
popularity
and
then
she
met
greyson
it
was
at
a
lunch
given
by
denton
greyson
was
a
bachelor
and
lived
with
an
unmarried
sister
a
few
years
older
than
himself
he
was
editor
and
part
proprietor
of
an
evening
paper
it
had
ideals
and
was
in
consequence
regarded
by
the
general
public
with
suspicion
but
by
reason
of
sincerity
and
braininess
was
rapidly
becoming
a
power
he
was
a
shy
reserved
man
with
an
aristocratic
head
set
upon
stooping
shoulders
the
face
was
that
of
a
dreamer
but
about
the
mouth
there
was
suggestion
of
the
fighter
joan
felt
at
her
ease
with
him
in
spite
of
the
air
of
detachment
that
seemed
part
of
his
character
denton
had
paired
them
off
together
and
during
the
lunch
one
of
them
joan
could
not
remember
which
had
introduced
the
subject
of
reincarnation
greyson
was
unable
to
accept
the
theory
because
of
the
fact
that
in
old
age
the
mind
in
common
with
the
body
is
subject
to
decay
perhaps
by
the
time
i
am
forty
or
let
us
say
fifty
he
argued
i
shall
be
a
bright
intelligent
being
if
i
die
then
well
and
good
i
select
a
likely
baby
and
go
straight
on
but
suppose
i
hang
about
till
eighty
and
die
a
childish
old
gentleman
with
a
mind
all
gone
to
seed
what
am
i
going
to
do
then
i
shall
have
to
begin
all
over
again
perhaps
worse
off
than
i
was
before
that
not
going
to
help
us
much
joan
explained
it
to
him
that
old
age
might
be
likened
to
an
illness
a
genius
lies
upon
a
bed
of
sickness
and
babbles
childish
nonsense
but
with
returning
life
he
regains
his
power
goes
on
increasing
it
the
mind
the
soul
has
not
decayed
it
is
the
lines
of
communication
that
old
age
has
destroyed
but
surely
you
do
believe
it
he
demanded
why
not
laughed
joan
all
things
are
possible
it
was
the
possession
of
a
hand
that
transformed
monkeys
into
men
we
used
to
take
things
up
you
know
and
look
at
them
and
wonder
and
wonder
and
wonder
till
at
last
there
was
born
a
thought
and
the
world
became
visible
it
is
curiosity
that
will
lead
us
to
the
next
great
discovery
we
must
take
things
up
and
think
and
think
and
think
till
one
day
there
will
come
knowledge
and
we
shall
see
the
universe
joan
always
avoided
getting
excited
when
she
thought
of
it
i
love
to
make
you
excited
flossie
had
once
confessed
to
her
in
the
old
student
days
you
look
so
ridiculously
young
and
you
are
so
pleased
with
yourself
laying
down
the
law
she
did
not
know
she
had
given
way
to
it
he
was
leaning
back
in
his
chair
looking
at
her
and
the
tired
look
she
had
noticed
in
his
eyes
when
she
had
been
introduced
to
him
in
the
had
gone
out
of
them
during
the
coffee
denton
beckoned
him
to
come
to
her
and
miss
greyson
crossed
over
and
took
his
vacant
chair
she
had
been
sitting
opposite
to
them
i
been
hearing
so
much
about
you
she
said
i
ca
help
thinking
that
you
ought
to
suit
my
brother
paper
he
has
all
your
ideas
have
you
anything
that
you
could
send
him
joan
considered
a
moment
nothing
very
startling
she
answered
i
was
thinking
of
a
series
of
articles
on
the
old
london
churches
touching
upon
the
people
connected
with
them
and
the
things
they
stood
for
i
just
finished
the
first
one
it
ought
to
be
the
very
thing
answered
miss
greyson
she
was
a
thin
faded
woman
with
a
soft
plaintive
voice
it
will
enable
him
to
judge
your
style
he
particular
about
that
though
i
confident
he
like
it
she
hastened
to
add
address
it
to
me
will
you
i
assist
him
as
much
as
i
can
joan
added
a
few
finishing
touches
that
evening
and
posted
it
and
a
day
or
two
later
received
a
note
asking
her
to
call
at
the
office
my
sister
is
enthusiastic
about
your
article
on
chelsea
church
and
insists
on
my
taking
the
whole
series
greyson
informed
her
she
says
you
have
the
stevensonian
touch
joan
flushed
with
pleasure
and
you
she
asked
did
you
think
it
had
the
stevensonian
touch
no
he
answered
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
more
of
your
touch
what
that
like
she
demanded
they
could
suppress
you
he
explained
sir
thomas
more
with
his
head
under
his
arm
bloody
old
bluebeard
grim
queen
bess
snarling
old
swift
pope
addison
carlyle
the
whole
grisly
crowd
of
them
i
could
see
you
holding
your
own
against
them
all
explaining
things
to
them
getting
excited
he
laughed
his
sister
joined
them
coming
in
from
the
next
room
she
had
a
proposal
to
make
it
was
that
joan
should
take
over
the
weekly
letter
from
clorinda
it
was
supposed
to
give
the
views
of
a
perhaps
unusually
sane
and
thoughtful
woman
upon
the
questions
of
the
day
miss
greyson
had
hitherto
conducted
it
herself
but
was
wishful
as
she
explained
to
be
relieved
of
it
so
that
she
might
have
more
time
for
home
affairs
it
would
necessitate
joan
frequent
attendance
at
the
office
for
there
would
be
letters
from
the
public
to
be
answered
and
points
to
be
discussed
with
her
brother
she
was
standing
behind
his
chair
with
her
hands
upon
his
head
there
was
something
strangely
motherly
about
her
whole
attitude
greyson
was
surprised
for
the
letter
had
been
her
own
conception
and
had
grown
into
a
popular
feature
but
she
was
evidently
in
earnest
and
joan
accepted
willingly
clorinda
grew
younger
more
on
the
whole
more
human
but
still
so
eminently
sane
and
reasonable
we
must
not
forget
that
she
is
quite
a
respectable
lady
connected
according
to
her
own
account
with
the
higher
political
circles
joan
editor
would
insist
with
a
laugh
miss
greyson
working
in
the
adjoining
room
would
raise
her
head
and
listen
she
loved
to
hear
him
laugh
it
absurd
flossie
told
her
one
morning
as
having
met
by
chance
they
were
walking
home
together
along
the
embankment
you
not
you
ought
to
be
writing
letters
to
her
not
from
her
waking
her
up
telling
her
to
come
off
her
perch
and
find
out
what
the
earth
feels
like
i
tell
you
what
i
do
i
trot
you
round
to
carleton
if
you
out
for
stirring
up
strife
and
contention
well
that
his
game
too
he
use
you
for
his
beastly
sordid
ends
he
have
roped
in
john
the
baptist
if
he
been
running
the
star
at
the
time
and
have
given
him
a
daily
column
for
so
long
as
the
boom
lasted
that
matter
if
he
willing
to
give
you
a
start
joan
jibbed
at
first
but
in
the
end
flossie
arguments
prevailed
one
afternoon
a
week
later
she
was
shown
into
carleton
private
room
and
the
door
closed
behind
her
the
light
was
dim
and
for
a
moment
she
could
see
no
one
until
carleton
who
had
been
standing
near
one
of
the
windows
came
forward
and
placed
a
chair
for
her
and
they
both
sat
down
i
glanced
through
some
of
your
things
he
said
they
all
right
they
alive
what
your
idea
remembering
flossie
counsel
she
went
straight
to
the
point
she
wanted
to
talk
to
the
people
she
wanted
to
get
at
them
if
she
had
been
a
man
she
would
have
taken
a
chair
and
gone
to
hyde
park
as
it
was
she
had
the
nerve
for
hyde
park
at
least
she
was
afraid
she
had
it
might
have
to
come
to
that
there
was
a
trembling
in
her
voice
that
annoyed
her
she
was
so
afraid
she
might
cry
she
was
out
for
anything
crazy
she
wanted
only
those
things
done
that
could
be
done
if
the
people
would
but
lift
their
eyes
look
into
one
another
faces
see
the
wrong
and
the
injustice
that
was
all
around
them
and
swear
that
they
would
never
rest
till
the
pain
and
the
terror
had
been
driven
from
the
land
she
wanted
soldiers
men
and
women
who
would
forget
their
own
sweet
selves
not
counting
their
own
loss
thinking
of
the
greater
gain
as
in
times
of
war
and
revolution
when
men
gave
even
their
lives
gladly
for
a
dream
for
a
hope
without
warning
he
switched
on
the
electric
lamp
that
stood
upon
the
desk
causing
her
to
draw
back
with
a
start
all
right
he
said
go
ahead
you
shall
have
your
tub
and
a
weekly
audience
of
a
million
readers
for
as
long
as
you
can
keep
them
interested
up
with
anything
you
like
and
down
with
everything
you
do
be
careful
not
to
land
me
in
a
libel
suit
call
the
whole
bench
of
bishops
hypocrites
and
all
the
ground
landlords
thieves
if
you
will
but
do
mention
names
and
do
get
me
into
trouble
with
the
police
beyond
that
i
sha
interfere
with
you
she
was
about
to
speak
one
stipulation
he
went
on
that
every
article
is
headed
with
your
photograph
he
read
the
sudden
dismay
in
her
eyes
how
else
do
you
think
you
are
going
to
attract
their
attention
he
asked
her
by
your
eloquence
hundreds
of
men
and
women
as
eloquent
as
you
could
ever
be
are
shouting
to
them
every
day
who
takes
any
notice
of
them
why
should
they
listen
any
the
more
to
you
another
cranky
highbrow
some
old
maid
most
likely
with
a
bony
throat
and
a
beaky
nose
if
woman
is
going
to
come
into
the
fight
she
will
have
to
use
her
own
weapons
if
she
is
prepared
to
do
that
she
make
things
hum
with
a
vengeance
she
the
biggest
force
going
if
she
only
knew
it
he
had
risen
and
was
pacing
the
room
the
advertiser
has
found
that
out
and
is
showing
the
way
he
snatched
at
an
illustrated
magazine
fresh
from
the
press
that
had
been
placed
upon
his
desk
and
opened
it
at
the
first
page
johnson

he
read
out
advertised
by
a
dainty
little
minx
showing
her
ankles
going
to
stop
for
a
moment
to
read
about
somebody
blacking
if
a
saucy
little
minx
is
there
to
trip
him
up
with
her
ankles
he
turned
another
page

to

and
very
nearly
ready
the
old
johnny
in

to

reads
the

he
fluttered
the
pages
then
flung
the
thing
across
to
her
look
at
it

said

he
continued
you
say
you
want
soldiers
throw
off
your
veil
and
call
for
them
your
namesake
of
france
do
you
think
if
she
had
contented
herself
with
writing
stirring
appeals
that
orleans
would
have
fallen
she
put
on
a
becoming
suit
of
armour
and
got
upon
a
horse
where
everyone
could
see
her
chivalry
is
dead
you
modern
women
are
ashamed
of
yourselves
ashamed
of
your
sex
you
do
give
it
a
chance
revive
it
stir
the
young

blood
their
souls

follow
he
reseated
himself
and
leant
across
towards
her
i
not
talking
business
he
said
this
thing
not
going
to
mean
much
to
me
one
way
or
the
other
i
want
you
to
win
farm

to

that
the
eternal
feminine
has
stepped
out
of
the

and
commands

a
dapper
young
man
opened
the
door
and
put
his
head
into
the
room
railway
smash
in
yorkshire
he
announced
carleton
sat
up
much
of
a
one
he
asked
the
dapper
gentleman
shrugged
his
shoulders
three
killed
eight
injured
so
far
he
answered
carleton
interest
appeared
to
collapse
stop
press
column
asked
the
dapper
gentleman
yes
i
suppose
so
replied
carleton
unless
something
better
turns
up
the
dapper
young
gentleman
disappeared
joan
had
risen
may
i
talk
it
over
with
a
friend
she
asked
myself
i
inclined
to
accept
you
will
if
you
in
earnest
he
answered
i
give
you
four
hours
look
in
afternoon
and
see
finch
it
will
be
for
the
the
inset
we
use
surfaced
paper
for
that
and
can
do
you
justice
finch
will
arrange
about
the
photograph
he
held
out
his
hand
shall
be
seeing
you
again
he
said
it
was
but
a
stone
throw
to
the
office
of
the
she
caught
greyson
just
as
he
was
leaving
and
put
the
thing
before
him
his
sister
was
with
him
he
did
not
answer
at
first
he
was
walking
to
and
fro
and
catching
his
foot
in
the
waste
paper
basket
he
kicked
it
savagely
out
of
his
way
so
that
the
contents
were
scattered
over
the
room
yes
he
right
he
said
it
was
the
virgin
above
the
altar
that
popularized
christianity
her
face
has
always
been
woman
fortune
if
she
going
to
become
a
fighter
it
will
have
to
be
her
weapon
he
had
used
almost
the
same
words
that
carleton
had
used
i
so
want
them
to
listen
to
me
she
said
after
all
it
only
like
having
a
very
loud
voice
he
looked
at
her
and
smiled
yes
he
said
it
a
voice
men
will
listen
to
mary
greyson
was
standing
by
the
fire
she
had
not
spoken
hitherto
you
wo
give
up
she
asked
joan
had
intended
to
do
so
but
something
in
mary
voice
caused
her
against
her
will
to
change
her
mind
of
course
not
she
answered
i
shall
run
them
both
it
will
be
like
writing
jekyll
and
hyde
what
will
you
sign
yourself
he
asked
my
own
name
i
think
she
said
joan
allway
miss
greyson
suggested
her
coming
home
to
dinner
with
them
but
joan
found
an
excuse
she
wanted
to
be
alone
chapter
v
the
twilight
was
fading
as
she
left
the
office
she
turned
northward
choosing
a
broad
road
it
did
not
matter
which
way
she
took
she
wanted
to
think
or
rather
to
dream
it
would
all
fall
out
as
she
had
intended
she
would
commence
by
becoming
a
power
in
journalism
she
was
reconciled
now
to
the
photograph
idea
was
even
keen
on
it
herself
she
would
be
taken
full
face
so
that
she
would
be
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
her
readers
as
she
talked
to
them
it
would
compel
her
to
be
herself
just
a
hopeful
loving
woman
a
little
better
educated
than
the
majority
having
had
greater
opportunity
a
little
further
seeing
maybe
having
had
more
leisure
for
thought
but
otherwise
no
whit
superior
to
any
other
young
eager
woman
of
the
people
this
absurd
journalistic
pose
of
omniscience
of
infallibility
this
garment
of
supreme
wisdom
that
like
the
king
clothes
in
the
fairy
story
was
donned
to
hide
his
nakedness
by
every
strutting
nonentity
of
fleet
street
she
would
have
no
use
for
it
it
should
be
a
friend
a
comrade
a
of
the
great
master
taking
counsel
with
them
asking
their
help
government
by
the
people
for
the
people
it
must
be
made
real
these
silent
workers
hurrying
homewards
through
the
darkening
streets
these
patient
housewives
casting
their
shadows
on
the
blinds
it
was
they
who
should
be
shaping
the
world
not
the
journalists
to
whom
all
life
was
but
so
much
copy
this
monstrous
conspiracy
once
of
the
sword
of
the
church
now
of
the
press
that
put
all
government
into
the
hands
of
a
few
stuffy
old
gentlemen
politicians
leader
writers
without
sympathy
or
understanding
it
was
time
that
it
was
swept
away
she
would
raise
a
new
standard
it
should
be
not
listen
to
me
oh
ye
dumb
but
speak
to
me
tell
me
your
hidden
hopes
your
fears
your
dreams
tell
me
your
experience
your
thoughts
born
of
knowledge
of
suffering
she
would
get
into
correspondence
with
them
go
among
them
talk
to
them
the
difficulty
at
first
would
be
in
getting
them
to
write
to
her
to
open
their
minds
to
her
these
voiceless
masses
that
never
spoke
but
were
always
being
spoken
for
by
leaders
representatives
who
immediately
they
had
climbed
into
prominence
took
their
place
among
the
rulers
and
then
from
press
and
platform
shouted
to
them
what
they
were
to
think
and
feel
it
was
as
if
the
were
to
claim
to
be
the
leader
the
representative
of
his
squad
or
the
to
pose
as
the
delegate
of
the
sheep
dealt
with
always
as
if
they
were
mere
herds
mere
flocks
they
had
almost
lost
the
power
of
individual
utterance
one
would
have
to
teach
them
encourage
them
she
remembered
a
sunday
class
she
had
once
conducted
and
how
for
a
long
time
she
had
tried
in
vain
to
get
the
children
to
come
in
to
take
a
hand
that
she
might
get
in
touch
with
them
understand
their
small
problems
she
had
urged
them
to
ask
questions
and
there
had
fallen
such
long
silences
until
at
last
one
cheeky
ragamuffin
had
piped
out
please
miss
have
you
got
red
hair
all
over
you
or
only
on
your
head
for
answer
she
had
rolled
up
her
sleeve
and
let
them
examine
her
arm
and
then
in
her
turn
had
insisted
on
rolling
up
his
sleeve
revealing
the
fact
that
his
arms
above
the
wrists
had
evidently
not
too
recently
been
washed
and
the
episode
had
ended
in
laughter
and
a
babel
of
shrill
voices
and
at
once
they
were
a
party
of
chums
discussing
matters
together
they
were
but
children
these
tired
men
and
women
just
released
from
their
day
toil
hastening
homeward
to
their
play
or
to
their
evening
tasks
a
little
humour
a
little
understanding
a
recognition
of
the
wonderful
likeness
of
us
all
to
one
another
underneath
our
outward
coverings
was
all
that
was
needed
to
break
down
the
barrier
establish
comradeship
she
stood
aside
a
moment
to
watch
them
streaming
by
keen
strong
faces
were
among
them
high
thoughtful
brows
kind
eyes
they
must
learn
to
think
to
speak
for
themselves
she
would
build
again
the
forum
the
people
business
should
no
longer
be
settled
for
them
behind
doors
the
good
of
the
farm
labourer
should
be
determined
not
exclusively
by
the
squire
and
his
relations
the
man
with
the
hoe
the
man
with
the
bent
back
and
the
patient
eyes
he
too
should
be
invited
to
the
council
board
domestic
problems
should
be
solved
not
solely
by
fine
gentlemen
from
oxford
the
wife
of
the
little
clerk
should
be
allowed
her
say
war
or
peace
it
should
no
longer
be
regarded
as
a
question
concerning
only
the
aged
rich
the
common
people
the
cannon
fodder
the
men
who
would
die
and
the
women
who
would
weep
they
should
be
given
something
more
than
the
privilege
of
either
cheering
platform
patriots
or
being
summoned
for
interrupting
public
meetings
from
a
dismal
side
street
there
darted
past
her
a
small
shapeless
figure
in
crumpled
cap
and
apron
evidently
a
member
of
that
lazy
class
the
domestic
servant
judging
from
the
talk
of
the
the
correspondence
in
the
papers
a
singularly
unsatisfactory
body
they
toiled
not
lived
in
luxury
and
demanded
grand
pianos
someone
had
proposed
doing
something
for
them
they
themselves
it
seemed
that
even
they
had
a
sort
of
conscience
were
up
in
arms
against
it
too
much
kindness
even
they
themselves
perceived
was
bad
for
them
they
were
holding
a
meeting
that
night
to
explain
how
contented
they
were
six
peeresses
had
consented
to
attend
and
speak
for
them
likely
enough
that
there
were
cockered
menials
imposing
upon
incompetent
mistresses
there
were
pampered
slaves
in
rome
but
these
others
these
poor
little
helpless
sluts
there
were
thousands
such
in
every
city
and
living
lonely
pleasureless
lives
they
must
be
taught
to
speak
in
other
voices
than
the
dulcet
tones
of
peeresses
by
the
light
of
the
guttering
candles
from
their
chill
attics
they
should
write
to
her
their
visions
she
had
reached
a
quiet
road
surrounding
a
great
park
lovers
furtively
holding
hands
passed
her
by
whispering
she
would
write
books
she
would
choose
for
her
heroine
a
woman
of
the
people
how
full
of
drama
of
tragedy
must
be
their
stories
their
problems
the
grim
realities
of
life
not
only
its
mere
sentimental
embroideries
the
daily
struggle
for
bare
existence
the
menace
of
unemployment
of
illness
leaving
them
helpless
amid
the
grinding
forces
crushing
them
down
on
every
side
the
ceaseless
need
for
courage
for
cunning
for
in
the
kingdom
of
the
poor
the
tyrant
and
the
oppressor
still
sit
in
the
high
places
the
robber
still
rides
fearless
in
a
noisy
flaring
street
a
woman
passed
her
carrying
a
netted
bag
showing
two
loaves
in
a
flash
it
came
to
her
what
it
must
mean
to
the
poor
this
daily
bread
that
in
comfortable
homes
had
come
to
be
regarded
as
a
thing
like
water
not
to
be
considered
to
be
used
without
stint
wasted
thrown
about
borne
by
those
feeble
knotted
hands
joan
saw
it
revealed
as
something
holy
hallowed
by
labour
sanctified
by
suffering
by
sacrifice
worshipped
with
fear
and
prayer
in
quiet
streets
of
stately
houses
she
caught
glimpses
through
uncurtained
windows
of
about
which
servants
moved
noiselessly
arranging
flowers
and
silver
she
wondered
idly
if
she
would
every
marry
a
gracious
hostess
gathering
around
her
brilliant
men
and
women
statesmen
writers
artists
captains
of
industry
counselling
them
even
learning
from
them
encouraging
shy
genius
perhaps
in
a
perfectly
harmless
way
allowing
it
the
inspiration
derivable
from
a
devotion
to
herself
a
salon
that
should
be
the
nucleus
of
all
those
forces
that
influence
influences
over
which
she
would
rule
with
sweet
and
wise
authority
the
idea
appealed
to
her
into
the
picture
slightly
to
the
background
she
unconsciously
placed
greyson
his
tall
thin
figure
with
its
air
of
distinction
seemed
to
fit
in
greyson
would
be
very
restful
she
could
see
his
handsome
ascetic
face
flush
with
pleasure
as
after
the
guests
were
gone
she
would
lean
over
the
back
of
his
chair
and
caress
for
a
moment
his
dark
soft
hair
tinged
here
and
there
with
grey
he
would
always
adore
her
in
that
distant
undemonstrative
way
of
his
that
would
never
be
tiresome
or
exacting
they
would
have
children
but
not
too
many
that
would
make
the
house
noisy
and
distract
her
from
her
work
they
would
be
beautiful
and
clever
unless
all
the
laws
of
heredity
were
to
be
set
aside
for
her
especial
injury
she
would
train
them
shape
them
to
be
the
heirs
of
her
labour
bearing
her
message
to
the
generations
that
should
follow
at
a
corner
where
the
trams
and
buses
stopped
she
lingered
for
a
while
watching
the
fierce
struggle
the
weak
and
aged
being
pushed
back
time
after
time
hardly
seeming
to
even
resent
it
regarding
it
as
in
the
natural
order
of
things
it
was
so
absurd
apart
from
the
injustice
the
brutality
of
it
the
poor
fighting
among
themselves
she
felt
as
once
when
watching
a
crowd
of
birds
to
whom
she
had
thrown
a
handful
of
crumbs
in
winter
time
as
if
they
had
not
enemies
enough
cats
weasels
rats
hawks
owls
the
hunger
and
the
cold
and
added
to
all
they
must
needs
make
the
struggle
yet
harder
for
one
another
pecking
at
each
eyes
joining
with
one
another
to
attack
the
fallen
these
tired
men
these
weary
women
lads
and
girls
why
did
they
not
organize
among
themselves
some
system
that
would
do
away
with
this
daily
warfare
of
each
against
all
if
only
they
could
be
got
to
grasp
the
fact
that
they
were
one
family
bound
together
by
suffering
then
and
not
till
then
would
they
be
able
to
make
their
power
felt
that
would
have
to
come
first
the
de
of
the
poor
in
the
end
she
would
go
into
parliament
it
would
be
bound
to
come
soon
the
woman
vote
and
after
that
the
opening
of
all
doors
would
follow
she
would
wear
her
college
robes
it
would
be
far
more
fitting
than
a
succession
of
flimsy
frocks
that
would
have
no
meaning
in
them
what
pity
it
was
that
the
art
of
dressing
its
relation
to
life
was
not
better
understood
what
devil
had
prompted
the
workers
to
discard
their
characteristic
costumes
that
had
been
both
beautiful
and
serviceable
for
these
hateful
clothes
that
made
them
look
like
walking
scarecrows
why
had
the
coming
of
democracy
coincided
seemingly
with
the
spread
of
ugliness
dull
towns
mean
streets
parks
corrugated
iron
roofs
christian
chapels
that
would
be
an
insult
to
a
heathen
idol
hideous
factories
why
need
they
be
hideous
pot
hats
baggy
trousers
vulgar
advertisements
stupid
fashions
for
women
that
spoilt
every
line
of
their
figure
dinginess
drabness
monotony
everywhere
it
was
ugliness
that
was
strangling
the
soul
of
the
people
stealing
from
them
all
dignity
all
all
honour
for
one
another
robbing
them
of
hope
of
reverence
of
joy
in
life
beauty
that
was
the
key
to
the
riddle
all
nature
its
golden
sunsets
and
its
silvery
dawns
the
glory
of
clouds
the
mystery
of
moonlit
glades
its
rivers
winding
through
the
meadows
the
calling
of
its
restless
seas
the
tender
witchery
of
spring
the
blazonry
of
autumn
woods
its
purple
moors
and
the
wonder
of
its
silent
mountains
its
cobwebs
glittering
with
a
thousand
jewels
the
pageantry
of
starry
nights
form
colour
music
the
feathered
choristers
of
bush
and
brake
raising
their
matin
and
their
evensong
the
whispering
of
the
leaves
the
singing
of
the
waters
the
voices
of
the
winds
beauty
and
grace
in
every
living
thing
but
man
the
leaping
of
the
hares
the
grouping
of
cattle
the
flight
of
swallows
the
dainty
loveliness
of
insects
wings
the
glossy
skin
of
horses
rising
and
falling
to
the
play
of
mighty
muscles
was
it
not
seeking
to
make
plain
to
us
that
god
language
was
beauty
man
must
learn
beauty
that
he
may
understand
god
she
saw
the
london
of
the
future
not
the
vision
popular
just
then
a
soaring
whirl
of
machinery
in
motion
of
moving
pavements
and
flying
omnibuses
of
screaming
gramophones
and
standardized
homes
a
city
where
electricity
was
king
and
man
its
soulless
slave
but
a
city
of
peace
of
restful
spaces
of
leisured
men
and
women
a
city
of
fine
streets
and
pleasant
houses
where
each
could
live
his
own
life
learning
freedom
individuality
a
city
of
noble
schools
of
workshops
that
should
be
worthy
of
labour
filled
with
light
and
air
smoke
and
filth
driven
from
the
land
science
no
longer
bound
to
commercialism
having
discovered
cleaner
forces
a
city
of
gay
playgrounds
where
children
should
learn
laughter
of
leafy
walks
where
the
creatures
of
the
wood
and
field
should
be
as
welcome
guests
helping
to
teach
sympathy
and
kindliness
a
city
of
music
of
colour
of
gladness
beauty
worshipped
as
religion
ugliness
banished
as
a
sin
no
ugly
slums
no
ugly
cruelty
no
slatternly
women
and
brutalized
men
no
ugly
sobbing
children
no
ugly
vice
flaunting
in
every
highway
its
insult
to
humanity
a
city
clad
in
beauty
as
with
a
living
garment
where
god
should
walk
with
man
she
had
reached
a
neighbourhood
of
narrow
crowded
streets
the
women
were
mostly
without
hats
and
swarthy
men
rolling
cigarettes
lounged
against
doorways
the
place
had
a
quaint
foreign
flavour
tiny
cafes
filled
with
smoke
and
noise
and
clean
inviting
restaurants
abounded
she
was
feeling
hungry
and
choosing
one
the
door
of
which
stood
open
revealing
white
tablecloths
and
a
pleasant
air
of
cheerfulness
she
entered
it
was
late
and
the
tables
were
crowded
only
at
one
in
a
far
corner
could
she
detect
a
vacant
place
opposite
to
a
slight
looking
girl
very
quietly
dressed
she
made
her
way
across
and
the
girl
anticipating
her
request
welcomed
her
with
a
smile
they
ate
for
a
while
in
silence
divided
only
by
the
narrow
table
their
heads
when
they
leant
forward
almost
touching
joan
noticed
the
short
white
hands
the
fragrance
of
some
delicate
scent
there
was
something
odd
about
her
she
seemed
to
be
unnecessarily
conscious
of
being
alone
suddenly
she
spoke
nice
little
restaurant
this
she
said
one
of
the
few
places
where
you
can
depend
upon
not
being
annoyed
joan
did
not
understand
in
what
way
she
asked
oh
you
know
men
answered
the
girl
they
come
and
sit
down
opposite
to
you
and
wo
leave
you
alone
at
most
of
the
places
you
got
to
put
up
with
it
or
go
outside
here
old
gustav
never
permits
it
joan
was
troubled
she
was
rather
looking
forward
to
occasional
restaurant
dinners
where
she
would
be
able
to
study
london
bohemia
you
mean
she
asked
that
they
force
themselves
upon
you
even
if
you
make
it
plain
oh
the
plainer
you
make
it
that
you
do
want
them
the
more
sport
they
think
it
interrupted
the
girl
with
a
laugh
joan
hoped
she
was
exaggerating
i
must
try
and
select
a
table
where
there
is
some
girl
to
keep
me
in
countenance
she
said
with
a
smile
yes
i
was
glad
to
see
you
answered
the
girl
it
hateful
dining
by
oneself
are
you
living
alone
yes
answered
joan
i
a
journalist
i
thought
you
were
something
answered
the
girl
i
an
artist
or
rather
was
she
added
after
a
pause
why
did
you
give
it
up
asked
joan
oh
i
have
given
it
up
not
entirely
the
girl
answered
i
can
always
get
a
couple
of
sovereigns
for
a
sketch
if
i
want
it
from
one
or
another
of
the
and
they
can
generally
sell
them
for
a
fiver
i
seen
them
marked
up
have
you
been
long
in
london
no
answered
joan
i
a
lancashire
lass
curious
said
the
girl
so
am
i
my
father
a
mill
manager
near
bolton
you
were
educated
there
no
joan
admitted
i
went
to
rodean
at
brighton
when
i
was
ten
years
old
and
so
escaped
it
nor
were
you
she
added
with
a
smile
judging
from
your
accent
no
answered
the
other
i
was
at
hastings
miss
gwyn
funny
how
we
seem
to
have
always
been
near
to
one
another
dad
wanted
me
to
be
a
doctor
but
i
always
been
mad
about
art
joan
had
taken
a
liking
to
the
girl
it
was
a
spiritual
vivacious
face
with
frank
eyes
and
a
firm
mouth
and
the
voice
was
low
and
strong
tell
me
she
said
what
interfered
with
it
unconsciously
she
was
leaning
forward
her
chin
supported
by
her
hands
their
faces
were
very
near
to
one
another
the
girl
looked
up
she
did
not
answer
for
a
moment
there
came
a
hardening
of
the
mouth
before
she
spoke
a
baby
she
said
oh
it
was
my
own
fault
she
continued
i
wanted
it
it
was
all
the
talk
at
the
time
you
do
remember
our
right
to
children
no
woman
complete
without
one
maternity
woman
kingdom
all
that
sort
of
thing
as
if
the
storks
brought
them
do
suppose
it
made
any
real
difference
but
it
just
helped
me
to
pretend
that
it
was
something
pretty
and
passion
used
to
be
the
explanation
before
that
i
guess
it
all
much
of
a
muchness
just
natural
instinct
the
restaurant
had
been
steadily
emptying
monsieur
gustav
and
his
bosomed
wife
were
seated
at
a
distant
table
eating
their
own
dinner
why
could
you
have
married
asked
joan
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
who
was
there
for
me
to
marry
she
answered
the
men
who
wanted
me
clerks
young
tradesmen
down
at
home
i
was
taking
any
of
that
lot
and
the
men
i
might
have
fancied
were
all
of
them
too
poor
there
was
one
student
he
got
on
since
easy
enough
for
him
to
talk
about
waiting
meanwhile
well
it
like
somebody
suggesting
dinner
to
you
the
day
after
all
right
enough
if
you
not
troubled
with
an
appetite
the
waiter
came
to
clear
the
table
they
were
almost
the
last
customers
left
the
man
tone
and
manner
jarred
upon
joan
she
had
not
noticed
it
before
joan
ordered
coffee
and
the
girl
exchanging
a
joke
with
the
waiter
added
a
liqueur
but
why
should
you
give
up
your
art
persisted
joan
it
was
that
was
sticking
in
her
mind
i
should
have
thought
that
if
only
for
the
sake
of
the
child
you
would
have
gone
on
with
it
oh
i
told
myself
all
that
answered
the
girl
was
going
to
devote
my
life
to
it
did
for
nearly
two
years
till
i
got
sick
of
living
like
a
nun
never
getting
a
bit
of
excitement
you
see
i
got
the
poison
in
me
or
maybe
it
had
always
been
there
what
become
of
it
asked
joan
the
child
mother
got
it
answered
the
girl
seemed
best
for
the
poor
little
beggar
i
supposed
to
be
dead
and
my
husband
gone
abroad
she
gave
a
short
dry
laugh
mother
brings
him
up
to
see
me
once
a
year
got
quite
fond
of
him
what
are
you
doing
now
asked
joan
in
a
low
tone
oh
you
need
look
so
scared
laughed
the
girl
i
have
come
down
to
that
her
voice
had
changed
it
had
a
note
of
shrillness
in
some
indescribable
way
she
had
grown
coarse
i
a
kept
woman
she
explained
what
else
is
any
woman
she
reached
for
her
jacket
and
the
waiter
sprang
forward
and
helped
her
on
with
it
prolonging
the
business
needlessly
she
wished
him
good
evening
in
a
tone
of
distant
hauteur
and
led
the
way
to
the
door
outside
the
street
was
dim
and
silent
joan
held
out
her
hand
no
hope
of
happy
endings
she
said
with
a
forced
laugh
marry
him
i
suppose
he
has
asked
me
answered
the
girl
with
a
swagger
not
sure
that
it
would
suit
me
now
they
not
so
nice
to
you
when
they
got
you
fixed
up
so
long
she
turned
abruptly
and
walked
rapidly
away
joan
moved
instinctively
in
the
opposite
direction
and
after
a
few
minutes
found
herself
in
a
broad
thoroughfare
a
newsboy
was
shouting
his
wares
murder
of
a
woman
shockin
details
speshul
repeating
it
over
and
over
again
in
a
hoarse
expressionless
monotone
he
was
selling
the
papers
like
hot
cakes
the
purchasers
too
eager
to
even
wait
for
their
change
she
wondered
with
a
little
lump
in
her
throat
how
many
would
have
stopped
to
buy
had
he
been
calling
instead
discovery
of
new
sonnet
by
shakespeare
extra
special
through
swinging
doors
she
caught
glimpses
of
foul
interiors
crowded
with
men
and
women
released
from
their
toil
taking
their
evening
pleasure
from
coloured
posters
outside
the
great
theatres
and
music
halls
vulgarity
and
lewdness
leered
at
her
side
by
side
with
announcements
that
the
house
was
full
from
every
roaring
corner
scintillating
lights
flared
forth
the
merits
of
this
public
whisky
of
this
other
celebrity
beer
it
seemed
the
only
message
the
people
cared
to
hear
even
among
the
sirens
of
the
pavement
she
noticed
that
the
quiet
and
merely
pretty
were
hardly
heeded
it
was
everywhere
the
painted
and
the
overdressed
that
drew
the
roving
eyes
she
remembered
a
pet
dog
that
someone
had
given
her
when
she
was
a
girl
and
how
one
afternoon
she
had
walked
with
the
tears
streaming
down
her
face
because
in
spite
of
her
scoldings
and
her
pleadings
it
would
keep
stopping
to
lick
up
filth
from
the
roadway
a
kindly
had
laughed
and
told
her
not
to
mind
why
that
a
sign
of
breeding
that
is
missie
the
man
had
explained
it
the
classy
ones
that
are
always
the
worst
it
had
come
to
her
afterwards
craving
with
its
soft
brown
troubled
eyes
for
forgiveness
but
she
had
never
been
able
to
break
it
of
the
habit
must
man
for
ever
be
chained
by
his
appetites
to
the
unclean
ever
be
driven
back
dragged
down
again
into
the
dirt
by
his
own
instincts
ever
be
rendered
useless
for
all
finer
purposes
by
the
baseness
of
his
own
desires
the
city
of
her
dreams
the
mingled
voices
of
the
crowd
shaped
itself
into
a
mocking
laugh
it
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
she
that
they
were
laughing
at
pointing
her
out
to
one
another
jeering
at
her
reviling
her
threatening
her
she
hurried
onward
with
bent
head
trying
to
escape
them
she
felt
so
small
so
helpless
almost
she
cried
out
in
her
despair
she
must
have
walked
mechanically
looking
up
she
found
herself
in
her
own
street
and
as
she
reached
her
doorway
the
tears
came
suddenly
she
heard
a
quick
step
behind
her
and
turning
she
saw
a
man
with
a
latch
key
in
his
hand
he
passed
her
and
opened
the
door
and
then
facing
round
stood
aside
for
her
to
enter
he
was
a
sturdy
man
with
a
strong
massive
face
it
would
have
been
ugly
but
for
the
deep
flashing
eyes
there
was
tenderness
and
humour
in
them
we
are
next
floor
neighbours
he
said
my
name
phillips
joan
thanked
him
as
he
held
the
door
open
for
her
their
hands
accidentally
touched
joan
wished
him
and
went
up
the
stairs
there
was
no
light
in
her
room
only
the
faint
reflection
of
the
street
lamp
outside
she
could
still
see
him
the
boyish
smile
and
his
voice
that
had
sent
her
tears
back
again
as
if
at
the
word
of
command
she
hoped
he
had
not
seen
them
what
a
little
fool
she
was
a
little
laugh
escaped
her
chapter
vi
one
day
joan
lunching
at
the
club
met
madge
singleton
i
had
such
a
funny
letter
from
flossie
said
joan
begging
me
almost
with
tears
in
her
ink
to
come
to
her
on
sunday
evening
to
meet
a
friend
of
hers
as
she
calls
him
and
give
her
my
opinion
of
him
what
on
earth
is
she
up
to
it
all
right
answered
madge
she
does
really
want
our
opinion
of
him
or
rather
she
does
want
our
real
opinion
of
him
she
only
wants
us
to
confirm
hers
she
engaged
to
him
flossie
engaged
joan
seemed
surprised
yes
answered
madge
it
used
to
be
a
custom
young
men
used
to
ask
young
women
to
marry
them
and
if
they
consented
it
was
called
engaged
still
prevails
so
i
am
told
in
certain
classes
thanks
said
joan
i
have
heard
of
it
i
thought
perhaps
you
had
from
your
tone
explained
madge
but
if
she
already
engaged
to
him
why
risk
criticism
of
him
argued
joan
ignoring
madge
flippancy
it
too
late
oh
she
going
to
break
it
off
unless
we
all
assure
her
that
we
find
him
brainy
madge
explained
with
a
laugh
it
seems
her
father
brainy
and
her
mother
was
or
else
it
was
the
other
way
about
i
not
quite
sure
but
whichever
it
was
it
led
to
ructions
myself
if
at
all
possible
and
seems
to
care
for
her
i
intend
to
find
him
brilliant
and
suppose
she
repeats
her
mother
experience
suggested
joan
there
were
the
answered
madge
impossible
to
have
found
a
more
evenly
matched
pair
they
both
write
novels
very
good
novels
too
and
got
jealous
of
one
another
and
threw
at
one
another
head
all
until
they
separated
do
know
of
any
recipe
myself
for
being
happy
ever
after
marriage
except
not
expecting
it
or
keeping
out
of
it
altogether
added
joan
ever
spent
a
day
at
the
home
for
destitute
gentlewomen
at
east
sheen
demanded
madge
not
yet
admitted
joan
may
have
to
later
on
it
ought
to
be
included
in
every
woman
education
madge
continued
it
is
reserved
for
spinsters
of
over
susan
fleming
wrote
an
article
upon
it
for
the
and
spent
an
afternoon
and
evening
there
a
month
later
she
married
a
grocer
with
five
children
the
only
sound
suggestion
for
avoiding
trouble
that
i
ever
came
across
was
in
a
burlesque
of
the
you
remember
the
scene
where
the
spirits
of
the
children
are
waiting
to
go
down
to
earth
and
be
made
into
babies
someone
had
stuck
up
a
notice
at
the
entrance
to
the
gangway
get
born
it
only
means
worry
flossie
had
her
in
a
second
floor
of
a
lodging
house
in
queen
square
bloomsbury
but
the
floor
being
for
the
moment
vacant
flossie
had
persuaded
her
landlady
to
let
her
give
her
party
there
it
seemed
as
if
fate
approved
of
the
idea
the
room
was
fairly
full
when
joan
arrived
flossie
took
her
out
on
the
landing
and
closed
the
door
behind
them
you
will
be
honest
with
me
wo
you
pleaded
flossie
because
so
important
and
i
do
seem
able
to
think
for
myself
as
they
say
no
man
can
be
his
own
solicitor
can
he
of
course
i
like
him
and
all
that
very
much
and
i
really
believe
he
loves
me
we
were
children
together
when
mummy
was
alive
and
then
he
had
to
go
abroad
and
has
only
just
come
back
of
course
i
got
to
think
of
him
too
as
he
says
but
then
on
the
other
hand
i
do
want
to
make
a
mistake
that
would
be
so
terrible
for
both
of
us
and
of
course
i
am
clever
and
there
was
poor
mummy
and
daddy
i
tell
you
all
about
them
one
day
it
was
so
awfully
sad
get
him
into
a
corner
and
talk
to
him
you
be
able
to
judge
in
a
moment
you
so
wonderful
he
quiet
on
the
outside
but
i
think
there
depth
in
him
we
must
go
in
now
she
had
talked
so
rapidly
joan
felt
as
if
her
hat
were
being
blown
away
she
had
difficulty
in
recognizing
flossie
all
the
cocksure
pertness
had
departed
she
seemed
just
a
kid
joan
promised
faithfully
and
flossie
standing
on
tiptoe
suddenly
kissed
her
and
then
bustled
her
in
flossie
young
man
was
standing
near
the
fire
talking
or
rather
listening
to
a
little
woman
in
a
short
white
frock
and
blue
ribbons
a
sombre
lady
just
behind
her
whom
joan
from
the
distance
took
to
be
her
nurse
turned
out
to
be
her
secretary
whose
duty
it
was
to
be
always
at
hand
prepared
to
take
down
any
happy
idea
that
might
occur
to
the
little
woman
in
the
course
of
conversation
the
little
woman
was
miss
rose
tolley
a
popular
novelist
she
was
explaining
to
flossie
young
man
whose
name
was
sam
halliday
the
reason
for
her
having
written
running
waters
her
latest
novel
it
is
daring
she
admitted
i
must
be
prepared
for
opposition
but
it
had
to
be
stated
i
take
myself
as
typical
she
continued
when
i
was
twenty
i
could
have
loved
you
you
were
the
type
of
man
i
did
love
halliday
who
had
been
supporting
the
weight
of
his
body
upon
his
right
leg
transferred
the
burden
to
his
left
but
now
i
and
i
could
love
you
if
i
tried
she
shook
her
curls
at
him
it
is
your
fault
it
is
that
i
have
changed
suppose
i
married
you
bit
of
bad
luck
for
both
of
us
suggested
halliday
a
tragedy
miss
tolley
corrected
him
there
are
millions
of
such
tragedies
being
enacted
around
us
at
this
moment
sensitive
women
compelled
to
suffer
the
embraces
of
men
that
they
have
come
to
loathe
what
to
be
done
flossie
who
had
been
hovering
impatient
broke
in
oh
do
you
believe
her
she
advised
halliday
she
loves
you
still
she
only
teasing
you
this
is
joan
she
introduced
her
miss
tolley
bowed
and
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
away
by
a
young
man
who
had
likewise
been
waiting
for
an
opening
he
represented
the
uplift
film
association
of
chicago
and
was
wishful
to
know
if
miss
tolley
would
consent
to
altering
the
last
chapter
and
so
providing
running
waters
with
a
happy
ending
he
pointed
out
the
hopelessness
of
it
in
its
present
form
for
film
purposes
the
discussion
was
brief
then
i
send
your
agent
the
contract
morrow
joan
overheard
him
say
a
minute
later
sam
halliday
she
liked
at
once
he
was
a
young
man
with
quiet
eyes
and
a
pleasant
voice
try
and
find
me
brainy
he
whispered
to
her
as
soon
as
flossie
was
out
of
earshot
talk
to
me
about
china
i
quite
intelligent
on
china
they
both
laughed
and
then
shot
a
guilty
glance
in
flossie
direction
do
the
women
really
crush
their
feet
asked
joan
yes
he
answered
all
those
who
have
no
use
for
them
about
one
per
cent
of
the
population
to
listen
to
miss
tolley
you
would
think
that
half
the
women
wanted
a
new
husband
every
ten
years
it
always
the
one
per
cent
that
get
themselves
talked
about
the
other
are
too
busy
you
are
young
for
a
philosopher
said
joan
he
laughed
i
told
you
i
be
all
right
if
you
started
me
on
china
he
said
why
are
you
marrying
flossie
joan
asked
him
she
thought
his
point
of
view
would
be
interesting
not
sure
i
am
yet
he
answered
with
a
grin
it
depends
upon
how
i
get
through
this
evening
he
glanced
round
the
room
have
i
got
to
pass
all
this
crowd
i
wonder
he
added
joan
eyes
followed
it
was
certainly
an
odd
collection
flossie
in
her
hunt
for
brains
had
issued
her
invitations
broadcast
and
her
fate
had
been
that
of
the
charity
concert
not
all
the
stars
upon
whom
she
had
most
depended
had
turned
up
on
the
other
hand
not
a
single
freak
had
failed
her
at
the
moment
the
centre
of
the
room
was
occupied
by
a
gentleman
and
two
ladies
in
classical
drapery
they
were
holding
hands
in
an
attitude
suggestive
of
a
joan
remembered
them
having
seen
them
on
one
or
two
occasions
wandering
in
the
king
road
chelsea
still
maintaining
as
far
as
the
traffic
would
allow
the
suggestion
and
generally
surrounded
by
a
crowd
of
children
ever
hopeful
that
at
the
next
corner
they
would
stop
and
do
something
really
interesting
they
belonged
to
a
society
whose
object
was
to
lure
the
london
public
by
the
force
of
example
towards
the
adoption
of
the
early
greek
fashions
and
the
simpler
greek
attitudes
a
friend
of
had
thrown
in
her
lot
with
them
but
could
never
be
induced
to
abandon
her
umbrella
they
also
as
joan
told
herself
were
reformers
near
to
them
was
a
picturesque
gentleman
with
a
beard
down
to
his
waist
whose
stunt
as
flossie
would
have
termed
it
was
hygienic
clothing
it
seemed
to
contain
an
undue
proportion
of
fresh
air
there
were
ladies
in
coats
and
collars
and
gentlemen
with
ringlets
more
than
one
of
the
guests
would
have
been
better
though
perhaps
not
happier
for
a
bath
i
fancy
that
the
idea
said
joan
what
will
you
do
if
you
fail
go
back
to
china
yes
he
answered
and
take
her
with
me
poor
little
girl
joan
rather
resented
his
tone
we
are
not
all
alike
she
remarked
some
of
us
are
quite
sane
he
looked
straight
into
her
eyes
you
are
he
said
i
have
been
reading
your
articles
they
are
splendid
i
going
to
help
how
can
you
she
said
i
mean
how
will
you
shipping
is
my
business
he
said
i
going
to
help
sailor
men
see
that
they
have
somewhere
decent
to
go
to
and
do
get
robbed
and
then
there
are
the
lascars
poor
devils
nobody
ever
takes
their
part
how
did
you
come
across
them
she
asked
the
articles
i
mean
did
flo
give
them
to
you
no
he
answered
just
chance
caught
sight
of
your
photo
tell
me
she
said
if
it
had
been
the
photo
of
a
woman
with
a
bony
throat
and
a
beaky
nose
would
you
have
read
them
he
thought
a
moment
guess
not
he
answered
you
just
as
bad
he
continued
is
it
the
young
clergyman
with
the
wavy
hair
and
the
beautiful
voice
that
you
all
flock
to
hear
no
getting
away
from
nature
but
it
was
only
that
he
hesitated
i
want
to
know
she
said
you
looked
so
young
he
answered
i
had
always
had
the
idea
that
it
was
up
to
the
old
people
to
put
the
world
to
rights
that
all
i
had
to
do
was
to
look
after
myself
it
came
to
me
suddenly
while
you
were
talking
to
me
i
mean
while
i
was
reading
you
that
if
you
were
worrying
yourself
about
it
i
got
to
come
in
too
that
it
would
be
mean
of
me
not
to
it
was
like
being
preached
to
it
was
somebody
calling
for
help
instinctively
she
held
out
her
hand
and
he
grasped
it
flossie
came
up
at
the
same
instant
she
wanted
to
introduce
him
to
miss
lavery
who
had
just
arrived
hullo
she
said
are
you
two
concluding
a
bargain
yes
said
joan
we
are
founding
the
league
of
youth
you
got
to
be
in
it
we
are
going
to
establish
branches
all
round
the
world
flossie
young
man
was
whisked
away
joan
who
had
seated
herself
in
a
small
chair
was
alone
for
a
few
minutes
miss
tolley
had
chanced
upon
a
human
document
with
the
help
of
which
she
was
hopeful
of
starting
a
press
controversy
concerning
the
morality
or
otherwise
of
running
waters
the
secretary
stood
just
behind
her
taking
notes
they
had
drifted
quite
close
joan
could
not
help
overhearing
it
always
seemed
to
me
immoral
the
marriage
ceremony
the
human
document
was
explaining
she
was
a
thin
sallow
woman
with
an
untidy
head
and
restless
eyes
that
seemed
to
be
always
seeking
something
to
look
at
and
never
finding
it
how
can
we
pledge
the
future
to
bind
oneself
to
live
with
a
man
when
perhaps
we
have
ceased
to
care
for
him
hideous
miss
tolley
murmured
agreement
our
love
was
beautiful
continued
the
human
document
eager
apparently
to
relate
her
experience
for
the
common
good
just
because
it
was
a
free
gift
we
were
not
fettered
to
one
another
at
any
moment
either
of
us
could
have
walked
out
of
the
house
the
idea
never
occurred
to
us
not
for
years
five
to
be
exact
the
secretary
at
a
sign
from
miss
tolley
made
a
memorandum
of
it
and
then
did
your
feelings
towards
him
change
suddenly
questioned
miss
tolley
no
explained
the
human
document
in
the
same
quick
even
tones
so
far
as
i
was
concerned
i
was
not
conscious
of
any
alteration
in
my
own
attitude
but
he
felt
the
need
of
more
solitude
for
his
development
we
parted
quite
good
friends
oh
said
miss
tolley
and
were
there
any
children
only
two
answered
the
human
document
both
girls
what
has
become
of
them
persisted
miss
tolley
the
human
document
looked
offended
you
do
not
think
i
would
have
permitted
any
power
on
earth
to
separate
them
from
me
do
you
she
answered
i
said
to
him
are
mine
mine
where
i
go
they
go
where
i
stay
they
stay
he
saw
the
justice
of
my
argument
and
they
are
with
you
now
concluded
miss
tolley
you
must
come
and
see
them
the
human
document
insisted
such
dear
magnetic
creatures
i
superintend
their
entire
education
myself
we
have
a
cottage
in
surrey
it
rather
a
tight
fit
you
see
there
are
seven
of
us
now
but
the
three
girls
can
easily
turn
in
together
for
a
night
abner
will
be
delighted
abner
is
your
second
suggested
miss
tolley
my
third
the
human
document
corrected
her
after
eustace
i
married
ivanoff
i
say
because
i
regard
it
as
the
holiest
form
of
marriage
he
had
to
return
to
his
own
country
there
was
a
political
movement
on
foot
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
go
i
want
you
particularly
to
meet
the
boy
he
will
interest
you
miss
tolley
appeared
to
be
getting
muddled
whose
boy
she
demanded
ivanoff
explained
the
human
document
he
was
our
only
child
flossie
appeared
towing
a
man
a
mr
folk
she
introduced
him
and
immediately
disappeared
joan
wished
she
had
been
left
alone
a
little
longer
she
would
like
to
have
heard
more
especially
was
she
curious
concerning
abner
the
lady
third
would
the
higher
moral
law
compel
him
likewise
to
leave
the
poor
lady
saddled
with
another
couple
of
children
or
would
she
on
this
occasion
get
in
or
rather
get
off
first
her
own
fancy
was
to
back
abner
she
did
catch
just
one
sentence
before
miss
tolley
having
obtained
more
food
for
reflection
than
perhaps
she
wanted
signalled
to
her
secretary
that
the
might
be
closed
woman
right
to
follow
the
dictates
of
her
own
heart
uncontrolled
by
any
law
the
human
document
was
insisting
that
is
one
of
the
first
things
we
must
fight
for
mr
folk
was
a
artist
he
lived
in
paris
you
are
wonderfully
like
your
mother
he
told
joan
in
appearance
i
mean
he
added
i
knew
her
when
she
was
miss
caxton
i
acted
with
her
in
america
joan
made
a
swift
effort
to
hide
her
surprise
she
had
never
heard
of
her
mother
having
been
upon
the
stage
i
did
not
know
that
you
had
been
an
actor
she
answered
i
was
really
explained
mr
folk
i
just
walked
and
talked
naturally
it
made
rather
a
sensation
at
the
time
your
mother
was
a
genius
you
have
never
thought
of
going
on
the
stage
yourself
no
said
joan
i
do
think
i
got
what
you
call
the
artistic
temperament
i
have
never
felt
drawn
towards
anything
of
that
sort
i
wonder
he
said
you
could
hardly
be
your
mother
daughter
without
it
tell
me
said
joan
what
was
my
mother
like
i
can
only
remember
her
as
more
or
less
of
an
invalid
he
did
not
reply
to
her
question
master
or
mistress
eminent
artist
he
said
intends
to
retire
from
his
or
her
particular
stage
whatever
it
may
be
that
paragraph
ought
always
to
be
put
among
the
obituary
notices
what
your
line
he
asked
her
i
take
it
you
have
one
by
your
being
here
besides
i
am
sure
you
have
i
am
an
old
fighter
i
can
tell
the
young
soldier
what
your
regiment
joan
laughed
i
a
drummer
boy
she
answered
i
beat
my
drum
each
week
in
a
sunday
newspaper
hoping
the
lads
will
follow
you
feel
you
must
beat
that
drum
he
suggested
beat
it
louder
and
louder
and
louder
till
all
the
world
shall
hear
it
yes
joan
agreed
i
think
that
does
describe
me
he
nodded
i
thought
you
were
an
artist
he
said
do
let
them
ever
take
your
drum
away
from
you
you
go
to
pieces
and
get
into
mischief
without
it
i
know
an
old
actress
he
continued
she
the
mother
of
four
they
are
all
on
the
stage
and
they
all
made
their
mark
the
youngest
was
born
in
her
just
after
the
curtain
had
fallen
she
was
playing
the
nurse
to
your
mother
juliet
she
is
still
the
best
nurse
that
i
know
always
worrying
me
to
chuck
it
and
devote
myself
to
the
children
she
confided
to
me
one
evening
while
she
was
waiting
for
her
cue
as
i
tell
him
i
more
helpful
to
them
being
with
them
half
the
day
alive
than
all
the
day
dead
that
an
anecdote
worth
remembering
when
your
time
comes
if
god
gives
woman
a
drum
he
mean
man
to
take
it
away
from
her
she
has
got
to
be
playing
it
for
hours
a
day
i
like
you
to
have
seen
your
cordelia
flossie
was
tacking
her
way
towards
them
joan
acted
on
impulse
i
wish
you
give
me
your
address
she
said
where
i
could
write
to
you
or
perhaps
you
would
not
mind
my
coming
and
seeing
you
one
day
i
would
like
you
to
tell
me
more
about
my
mother
he
gave
her
his
address
in
paris
where
he
was
returning
almost
immediately
do
come
he
said
it
will
take
me
back
years
i
proposed
to
your
mother
on
la
grande
terrasse
at
germain
we
will
walk
there
i
still
a
bachelor
he
laughed
and
kissing
her
hand
allowed
himself
to
be
hauled
away
by
flossie
in
exchange
for
phillips
for
whom
miss
lavery
had
insisted
on
an
invitation
joan
had
met
phillips
several
times
and
once
on
the
stairs
had
stopped
and
spoken
to
her
but
had
never
been
introduced
to
her
formally
till
now
we
have
been
meaning
to
call
on
you
so
often
panted
phillips
the
room
was
crowded
and
the
exertion
of
squeezing
her
way
through
had
winded
the
poor
lady
we
take
so
much
interest
in
your
articles
my
husband
she
paused
for
a
second
before
venturing
upon
the
word
and
the
aitch
came
out
somewhat
reads
them
most
religiously
you
must
come
and
dine
with
us
one
evening
joan
answered
that
she
would
be
very
pleased
i
will
find
out
when
robert
is
free
and
run
up
and
let
you
know
she
continued
of
course
there
are
so
many
demands
upon
him
especially
during
this
period
of
national
crisis
that
i
spare
him
all
the
social
duties
that
i
can
but
i
shall
insist
on
his
making
an
exception
in
your
case
joan
murmured
her
sense
of
favour
but
hoped
she
would
not
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
more
pressing
calls
upon
phillips
time
it
will
do
him
good
answered
phillips
getting
away
from
them
all
for
an
hour
or
two
i
do
see
much
of
him
myself
she
glanced
round
and
lowered
her
voice
they
tell
me
she
said
that
you
a
yes
answered
joan
one
goes
in
for
it
more
out
of
vanity
afraid
than
for
any
real
purpose
that
it
serves
i
took
one
or
two
prizes
myself
said
phillips
but
of
course
one
forgets
things
i
was
wondering
if
you
would
mind
if
i
ran
up
occasionally
to
ask
you
a
question
of
course
as
you
know
my
so
few
advantages
the
lady
mind
was
concerned
with
more
important
matters
and
the
aspirates
on
this
occasion
got
themselves
neglected
it
is
wonderful
what
he
done
without
them
but
if
now
and
then
i
could
him
there
was
something
about
the
poor
foolish
painted
face
as
it
looked
up
pleadingly
that
gave
it
a
momentary
touch
of
beauty
do
said
joan
speaking
earnestly
i
shall
be
so
very
pleased
if
you
will
thank
you
said
the
woman
miss
lavery
came
up
in
a
hurry
to
introduce
her
to
miss
tolley
i
am
telling
all
my
friends
to
read
your
articles
she
added
resuming
the
gracious
patroness
as
she
bowed
her
adieus
joan
was
alone
again
for
a
while
a
handsome
girl
with
her
hair
cut
short
and
parted
at
the
side
was
discussing
diseases
of
the
spine
with
a
young
man
in
a
velvet
suit
the
gentleman
was
describing
some
of
the
effects
in
detail
joan
felt
there
was
danger
of
her
being
taken
ill
if
she
listened
any
longer
and
seeing
madge
brother
near
the
door
and
unoccupied
she
made
her
way
across
to
him
niel
singleton
or
keeley
as
he
called
himself
upon
the
stage
was
quite
unlike
his
sister
he
was
short
and
plump
with
a
preternaturally
solemn
face
contradicted
by
small
twinkling
eyes
he
motioned
joan
to
a
chair
and
told
her
to
keep
quiet
and
not
disturb
the
meeting
is
he
brainy
he
whispered
after
a
minute
i
like
him
said
joan
i
did
ask
you
if
you
liked
him
he
explained
to
her
i
asked
you
if
he
was
brainy
i
not
too
sure
that
you
like
brainy
men
yes
i
do
said
joan
i
like
you
sometimes
now
none
of
that
he
said
severely
it
no
good
your
thinking
of
me
i
wedded
to
my
art
we
are
talking
about
mr
halliday
what
does
madge
think
of
him
asked
joan
madge
has
fallen
in
love
with
him
and
her
judgment
is
not
to
be
relied
upon
he
said
i
suppose
you
could
answer
a
straight
question
if
you
tried
do
be
so
harsh
with
me
pleaded
joan
meekly
i
trying
to
think
yes
she
continued
decidedly
he
got
brains
enough
for
the
two
of
them
demanded
singleton
because
he
will
want
them
now
think
before
you
speak
joan
considered
yes
she
answered
i
should
say
he
just
the
man
to
manage
her
then
it
settled
he
said
we
must
save
her
save
her
from
what
demanded
joan
from
his
saying
to
himself
is
flossie
idea
of
a
party
this
is
the
sort
of
thing
that
if
i
marry
her
i
am
letting
myself
in
for
if
he
has
broken
off
the
engagement
already
we
may
be
in
time
he
led
the
way
to
the
piano
tell
madge
i
want
her
he
whispered
he
struck
a
few
notes
and
then
in
a
voice
that
drowned
every
other
sound
in
the
room
struck
up
a
comic
song
the
effect
was
magical
he
followed
it
up
with
another
this
one
with
a
chorus
consisting
chiefly
of
umpty
umpty
umpty
umpty
ay
which
was
vociferously
encored
by
the
time
it
was
done
with
madge
had
discovered
a
girl
who
could
sing
three
little
pigs
and
a
sad
gentleman
who
told
stories
at
the
end
of
one
of
them
madge
brother
spoke
to
joan
in
a
tone
more
of
sorrow
than
of
anger
hardly
the
sort
of
anecdote
that
a
truly
noble
and
young
woman
would
have
received
with
laughter
he
commented
did
i
laugh
said
joan
your
having
done
so
unconsciously
only
makes
the
matter
worse
observed
singleton
i
had
hoped
it
emanated
from
politeness
not
enjoyment
do
tease
her
said
madge
she
having
an
evening
off
joan
and
the
singletons
were
the
last
to
go
they
promised
to
show
halliday
a
short
cut
to
his
hotel
in
holborn
have
you
thanked
miss
lessing
for
a
pleasant
evening
asked
singleton
turning
to
halliday
he
laughed
and
put
his
arm
round
her
poor
little
woman
he
said
you
looking
so
tired
it
was
jolly
at
the
end
he
kissed
her
he
had
passed
through
the
swing
doors
and
they
were
standing
on
the
pavement
waiting
for
joan
bus
why
did
we
all
like
him
asked
joan
even
miss
lavery
nothing
extraordinary
about
him
oh
yes
there
is
said
madge
love
has
lent
him
gilded
armour
from
his
helmet
waves
her
crest
she
quoted
most
men
look
fine
in
that
costume
pity
they
ca
always
wear
it
the
conductor
seemed
impatient
joan
sprang
upon
the
step
and
waved
her
hand
chapter
vii
joan
was
making
herself
a
cup
of
tea
when
there
came
a
tap
at
the
door
it
was
phillips
i
heard
you
come
in
she
said
you
not
busy
are
you
no
answered
joan
i
hope
you
not
i
generally
in
about
this
time
and
it
always
nice
to
gossip
over
a
dish
of
tea
why
do
you
say
of
tea
asked
phillips
as
she
lowered
herself
with
evident
satisfaction
into
the
easy
chair
joan
placed
for
her
oh
i
do
know
laughed
joan
johnson
always
talked
of
a
of
tea
gives
it
a
literary
flavour
i
heard
of
him
said
phillips
he
worth
reading
is
he
well
he
talked
more
amusingly
than
he
wrote
explained
joan
get
boswell
life
of
him
or
i
lend
you
mine
she
added
if
you
be
careful
of
it
you
find
all
the
passages
marked
that
are
best
worth
remembering
at
least
i
think
so
thanks
said
phillips
you
see
as
the
wife
of
a
public
man
i
get
so
little
time
for
study
is
it
settled
yet
asked
joan
are
they
going
to
make
room
for
him
in
the
cabinet
i
afraid
so
answered
phillips
oh
of
course
i
want
him
to
she
corrected
herself
and
he
must
of
course
if
the
king
insists
upon
it
but
i
wish
it
had
all
come
with
such
a
whirl
what
shall
i
have
to
do
do
you
think
joan
was
pouring
out
the
tea
oh
nothing
she
answered
but
just
be
agreeable
to
the
right
people
he
tell
you
who
they
are
and
take
care
of
him
i
wish
i
taken
more
interest
in
politics
when
i
was
young
said
phillips
of
course
when
i
was
a
girl
women
were
supposed
to
do
you
know
i
should
worry
about
them
if
i
were
you
joan
advised
her
let
him
forget
them
when
he
with
you
a
man
can
have
too
much
of
a
good
thing
she
laughed
i
wonder
if
you
right
mused
phillips
he
does
often
say
that
he
just
as
soon
i
did
talk
about
them
joan
shot
a
glance
from
over
her
cup
the
poor
puzzled
face
was
staring
into
the
fire
joan
could
almost
hear
him
saying
it
i
sure
i
am
she
said
make
a
change
to
him
as
you
said
yourself
the
other
evening
it
good
for
him
to
get
away
from
it
all
now
and
then
i
must
try
agreed
phillips
looking
up
what
sort
of
things
ought
i
to
talk
to
him
about
do
you
think
joan
gave
an
inward
sigh
had
the
poor
lady
any
friends
of
her
own
oh
almost
anything
she
answered
vaguely
so
long
as
it
cheerful
and
what
used
you
to
talk
about
before
he
became
a
great
man
there
came
a
wistful
look
into
the
worried
eyes
oh
it
was
all
so
different
then
she
said
just
liked
to
you
know
we
did
seem
to
to
talk
was
a
rare
one
to
tease
i
did
know
clever
was
then
it
seemed
a
difficult
case
to
advise
upon
how
long
have
you
been
married
joan
asked
fifteen
years
she
answered
i
was
a
bit
older
than
but
never
looked
my
age
they
tell
me
lord
what
a
boy
was
swept
you
off
your
feet
like
was
the
only
one
i
got
a
way
with
me
i
suppose
anyhow
the
men
seemed
to
think
so
there
was
always
a
few
about
like
flies
round
a
mother
used
to
say
she
giggled
but
would
take
no
for
an
answer
and
i
did
want
to
give
it
neither
i
was
gone
on
right
enough
no
use
saying
i
was
you
must
be
glad
you
did
say
no
suggested
joan
yes
she
answered
got
on
i
always
think
of
that
little
poem
burleigh
she
continued
whenever
i
get
worrying
about
myself
ever
read
it
yes
answered
joan
he
was
a
landscape
painter
was
he
that
the
one
said
phillips
i
little
thought
i
was
letting
myself
in
for
being
the
wife
of
a
big
pot
when
bob
phillips
came
along
in
miner
jacket
you
soon
get
used
to
it
joan
told
her
the
great
thing
is
not
to
be
afraid
of
one
fate
whatever
it
is
but
just
to
do
one
best
it
was
rather
like
talking
to
a
child
you
the
right
sort
to
put
into
a
body
i
glad
i
came
up
said
phillips
i
get
a
bit
down
in
the
mouth
sometimes
when
goes
off
into
one
of
brown
studies
and
i
do
seem
to
know
what
thinking
about
but
it
do
last
long
i
was
always
one
of
the
ones
they
discussed
life
on
two
thousand
a
year
the
problems
it
would
present
and
phillips
became
more
cheerful
joan
laid
herself
out
to
be
friendly
she
hoped
to
establish
an
influence
over
phillips
that
should
be
for
the
poor
lady
good
and
as
she
felt
instinctively
for
poor
phillips
also
it
was
not
an
unpleasing
face
underneath
the
paint
it
was
kind
and
womanly
joan
was
sure
he
would
like
it
better
clean
a
few
months
attention
to
diet
would
make
a
decent
figure
of
her
and
improve
her
wind
joan
watched
her
spreading
the
butter
a
quarter
of
an
inch
thick
upon
her
toast
and
restrained
with
difficulty
the
impulse
to
take
it
away
from
her
and
her
clothes
joan
had
seen
guys
carried
through
the
streets
on
the
fifth
of
november
that
were
less
obtrusive
she
remembered
as
she
was
taking
her
leave
what
she
had
come
for
which
was
to
invite
joan
to
dinner
on
the
following
friday
it
just
a
homely
affair
she
explained
she
had
recovered
her
form
and
was
now
quite
the
lady
again
two
other
guests
beside
yourself
a
airlie
i
am
sure
you
will
like
him
he
so
dilletanty
and
mckean
he
the
young
man
upstairs
have
you
met
him
joan
had
except
once
on
the
stairs
when
to
avoid
having
to
pass
her
he
had
gone
down
again
and
out
into
the
street
from
the
doorstep
she
had
caught
sight
of
his
disappearing
round
the
corner
yielding
to
impishness
she
had
run
after
him
and
his
expression
of
blank
horror
when
glancing
over
his
shoulder
he
found
her
walking
abstractedly
three
yards
behind
him
had
gladdened
all
her
evening
joan
recounted
the
episode
so
far
as
the
doorstep
he
tried
to
be
shy
with
me
said
phillips
but
i
would
let
him
i
chipped
him
out
of
it
if
he
going
to
write
plays
as
i
told
him
he
will
have
to
get
over
his
fear
of
a
petticoat
she
offered
her
cheek
and
joan
kissed
it
somewhat
gingerly
you
wo
mind
robert
not
wearing
evening
dress
she
said
he
never
will
if
he
can
help
it
i
shall
just
slip
on
a
myself
joan
had
difficulty
in
deciding
on
her
own
frock
her
four
evening
dresses
as
she
walked
round
them
spread
out
upon
the
bed
all
looked
too
imposing
for
what
phillips
had
warned
her
would
be
a
homely
affair
she
had
one
other
a
with
sleeves
to
the
elbow
that
she
had
had
made
expressly
for
public
dinners
and
political
at
homes
but
that
would
be
going
to
the
opposite
extreme
and
might
seem
discourteous
to
her
hostess
besides
mousey
colours
did
really
suit
her
they
gave
her
a
curious
sense
of
being
affected
in
the
end
she
decided
to
risk
a
black
square
cut
with
a
girdle
of
gold
embroidery
there
could
be
anything
quieter
than
black
and
the
gold
embroidery
was
of
the
simplest
she
would
wear
it
without
any
jewellery
whatever
except
just
a
star
in
her
hair
the
result
as
she
viewed
the
effect
in
the
long
glass
quite
satisfied
her
perhaps
the
jewelled
star
did
scintillate
rather
it
had
belonged
to
her
mother
but
her
hair
was
so
full
of
shadows
it
wanted
something
to
relieve
it
also
she
approved
the
curved
line
of
her
bare
arms
it
was
certainly
very
beautiful
a
woman
arm
she
took
her
gloves
in
her
hand
and
went
down
phillips
was
not
yet
in
the
room
phillips
in
with
an
ostrich
feather
in
her
hair
greeted
her
effusively
and
introduced
her
to
her
fellow
guests
airlie
was
a
slight
elegant
gentleman
of
uncertain
age
with
sandy
hair
and
beard
cut
vandyke
fashion
he
asked
joan
permission
to
continue
his
cigarette
you
have
chosen
the
better
part
he
informed
her
on
her
granting
it
when
i
not
smoking
i
talking
mckean
shook
her
hand
vigorously
without
looking
at
her
and
this
is
hilda
concluded
phillips
she
ought
to
be
in
bed
if
she
had
a
naughty
daddy
who
spoils
her
a
lank
girl
with
a
pair
of
burning
eyes
looking
out
of
a
face
that
but
for
the
thin
line
of
the
lips
would
have
been
absolutely
colourless
rose
suddenly
from
behind
a
bowl
of
artificial
flowers
joan
could
not
suppress
a
slight
start
she
had
not
noticed
her
on
entering
the
girl
came
slowly
forward
and
joan
felt
as
if
the
uncanny
eyes
were
eating
her
up
she
made
an
effort
and
held
out
her
hand
with
a
smile
and
the
girl
long
thin
fingers
closed
on
it
in
a
pressure
that
hurt
she
did
not
speak
she
only
came
back
yesterday
for
the
explained
phillips
there
no
keeping
her
away
from
her
books
was
her
own
wish
to
be
sent
to
how
would
you
like
to
go
to
girton
and
be
a
like
miss
allway
she
asked
turning
to
the
child
phillips
entrance
saved
the
need
of
a
reply
to
the
evident
surprise
of
his
wife
he
was
in
evening
clothes
hulloa
you
got
on
she
said
he
laughed
i
shall
have
to
get
used
to
them
sooner
or
later
he
said
joan
felt
relieved
she
hardly
knew
why
that
he
bore
the
test
it
was
a
athletic
frame
and
he
had
gone
to
a
good
tailor
he
looked
taller
in
them
and
the
strong
face
less
rugged
joan
sat
next
to
him
at
the
round
with
the
child
the
other
side
of
him
she
noticed
that
he
ate
as
far
as
possible
with
his
right
hand
his
hands
were
large
but
smooth
and
well
shaped
his
left
remaining
under
the
cloth
beneath
which
the
child
right
hand
when
free
would
likewise
disappear
for
a
while
the
conversation
consisted
chiefly
of
anecdotes
by
airlie
there
were
few
public
men
and
women
about
whom
he
did
not
know
something
to
their
disadvantage
joan
listening
found
herself
repeating
the
experience
of
a
night
or
two
previous
when
during
a
performance
of
niel
singleton
who
was
playing
the
had
taken
her
behind
the
scenes
hamlet
the
king
of
denmark
and
the
ghost
were
sharing
a
bottle
of
champagne
in
the
ghost
it
happened
to
be
the
ghost
birthday
on
her
return
to
the
front
of
the
house
her
interest
in
the
play
was
gone
it
was
absurd
that
it
should
be
so
but
the
fact
remained
airlie
had
lunched
the
day
before
with
a
leonine
old
gentleman
who
every
sunday
morning
thundered
forth
social
democracy
to
enthusiastic
multitudes
on
tower
hill
joan
had
once
listened
to
him
and
had
almost
been
converted
he
was
so
tremendously
in
earnest
she
now
learnt
that
he
lived
in
curzon
street
mayfair
and
filled
in
private
life
the
perfectly
legitimate
calling
of
a
company
promoter
in
partnership
with
a
dutch
jew
his
latest
prospectus
dwelt
upon
the
profits
to
be
derived
from
an
amalgamation
of
the
leading
tanning
industries
by
means
of
which
the
price
of
leather
could
be
enormously
increased
it
was
utterly
illogical
but
her
interest
in
the
principles
of
social
democracy
was
gone
a
very
little
while
ago
airlie
in
his
capacity
of
second
cousin
to
one
of
the
ladies
concerned
a
charming
girl
but
impulsive
had
been
called
upon
to
attend
a
family
council
of
a
painful
nature
the
gentleman
name
took
joan
breath
away
it
was
the
name
of
one
of
her
heroes
an
eminent
writer
one
might
almost
say
prophet
she
had
hitherto
read
his
books
with
grateful
reverence
they
pictured
for
her
the
world
made
perfect
and
explained
to
her
just
precisely
how
it
was
to
be
accomplished
but
as
far
as
his
own
particular
corner
of
it
was
concerned
he
seemed
to
have
made
a
sad
mess
of
it
human
nature
of
quite
an
pattern
had
crept
in
and
spoilt
all
his
own
theories
of
course
it
was
unreasonable
the
may
remain
embedded
in
weeds
it
notwithstanding
points
the
way
to
the
fair
city
she
told
herself
this
but
it
left
her
still
she
did
care
which
way
it
pointed
she
did
believe
there
was
any
fair
city
there
was
a
famous
preacher
he
lived
the
simple
life
in
a
small
house
in
battersea
and
consecrated
all
his
energies
to
the
service
of
the
poor
almost
by
his
unselfish
zeal
he
had
persuaded
joan
of
the
usefulness
of
the
church
airlie
frequently
visited
him
they
interested
one
another
what
struck
airlie
most
was
the
devotion
with
which
the
reverend
gentleman
wife
and
family
surrounded
him
it
was
beautiful
to
see
the
calls
upon
his
moderate
purse
necessitated
by
his
and
much
paragraphed
activities
left
but
a
narrow
margin
for
domestic
expenses
with
the
result
that
often
the
only
fire
in
the
house
blazed
brightly
in
the
study
where
airlie
and
the
reverend
gentleman
sat
talking
while
mother
and
children
warmed
themselves
with
sense
of
duty
in
the
cheerless
kitchen
and
often
as
airlie
who
was
of
an
inquiring
turn
of
mind
had
convinced
himself
the
only
evening
meal
that
resources
would
permit
was
the
satisfying
supper
for
one
brought
by
the
youngest
daughter
to
her
father
where
he
sat
alone
in
the
small
airlie
picking
daintily
at
his
food
continued
his
stories
of
philanthropists
who
paid
starvation
wages
of
feminists
who
were
a
holy
terror
to
their
women
folk
of
socialists
who
travelled
and
spent
their
winters
in
egypt
or
monaco
of
stern
critics
of
public
morals
who
preferred
the
society
of
youthful
affinities
to
the
continued
company
of
elderly
wives
of
poets
who
wrote
divinely
about
babies
feet
and
whose
children
hated
them
do
you
think
it
all
true
joan
whispered
to
her
host
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
reason
why
it
should
be
he
said
i
generally
found
him
right
i
never
been
able
myself
he
continued
to
understand
the
enthusiasm
for
david
i
suppose
it
was
the
psalms
that
did
it
joan
was
about
to
offer
comment
but
was
struck
dumb
with
astonishment
on
hearing
mckean
voice
it
seemed
he
could
talk
he
was
telling
of
an
old
scotch
peasant
farmer
a
mean
cantankerous
old
cuss
whose
curious
pride
it
was
that
he
had
never
given
anything
away
not
a
crust
nor
a
sixpence
nor
a
rag
and
never
would
many
had
been
the
attempts
to
make
him
break
his
boast
some
for
the
joke
of
the
thing
and
some
for
the
need
but
none
had
ever
succeeded
it
was
his
one
claim
to
distinction
and
he
guarded
it
one
evening
it
struck
him
that
the
standing
just
inside
the
window
had
been
tampered
with
next
day
he
marked
with
a
scratch
the
inside
of
the
pan
and
returning
later
found
the
level
of
the
milk
had
sunk
half
an
inch
so
he
hid
himself
and
waited
and
at
twilight
the
next
day
the
window
was
stealthily
pushed
open
and
two
small
haunted
eyes
peered
round
the
room
they
satisfied
themselves
that
no
one
was
about
and
a
tiny
hand
clutching
a
cracked
jug
was
thrust
swiftly
in
and
dipped
into
the
pan
and
the
window
softly
closed
he
knew
the
thief
the
grandchild
of
an
old
bedridden
dame
who
lived
some
miles
away
on
the
edge
of
the
moor
the
old
man
stood
long
watching
the
small
cloaked
figure
till
it
was
lost
in
the
darkness
it
was
not
till
he
lay
upon
his
dying
bed
that
he
confessed
it
but
each
evening
from
that
day
he
would
steal
into
the
room
and
see
to
it
himself
that
the
window
was
left
ajar
after
the
coffee
phillips
proposed
their
adjourning
to
the
room
the
other
side
of
the
folding
doors
which
had
been
left
open
phillips
asked
her
to
leave
joan
and
himself
where
they
were
he
wanted
to
talk
to
her
he
promised
not
to
bore
her
for
more
than
ten
minutes
the
others
rose
and
moved
away
hilda
came
and
stood
before
joan
with
her
hands
behind
her
i
am
going
to
bed
now
she
said
i
wanted
to
see
you
from
what
papa
told
me
may
i
kiss
you
it
was
spoken
so
gravely
that
joan
did
not
ask
her
as
in
lighter
mood
she
might
have
done
what
it
was
that
phillips
had
said
she
raised
her
face
quietly
and
the
child
bent
forward
and
kissed
her
and
went
out
without
looking
back
at
either
of
them
leaving
joan
more
serious
than
there
seemed
any
reason
for
phillips
filled
his
pipe
and
lighted
it
i
wish
i
had
your
pen
he
said
suddenly
breaking
the
silence
all
right
at
talking
but
i
want
to
get
at
the
others
the
men
and
women
who
never
come
thinking
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
them
i
shy
and
awkward
when
i
try
to
write
there
seems
a
barrier
in
front
of
me
you
break
through
it
one
hears
your
voice
tell
me
he
said
are
you
getting
your
way
do
they
answer
you
yes
said
joan
not
any
great
number
of
them
not
yet
but
enough
to
show
that
i
really
am
interesting
them
it
grows
every
week
tell
them
that
he
said
let
them
hear
each
other
it
the
same
at
a
meeting
you
wait
ten
minutes
sometimes
before
one
man
will
summon
up
courage
to
put
a
question
but
once
one
or
two
have
ventured
they
spring
up
all
round
you
i
was
wondering
he
added
if
you
would
help
me
let
me
use
you
now
and
again
it
is
what
i
should
love
she
answered
tell
me
what
to
do
she
was
not
conscious
of
the
low
vibrating
tone
in
which
she
spoke
i
want
to
talk
to
them
he
said
about
their
stomachs
i
want
them
to
see
the
need
of
concentrating
upon
the
food
problem
insisting
that
it
shall
be
solved
the
other
things
can
follow
there
was
an
old
egyptian
chap
he
said
a
governor
of
one
of
their
provinces
thousands
of
years
before
the
pharaohs
were
ever
heard
of
they
dug
up
his
tomb
a
little
while
ago
it
bore
this
inscription
my
time
no
man
went
hungry
i
rather
have
that
carved
upon
my
gravestone
than
the
boastings
of
all
the
robbers
and
the
butchers
of
history
think
what
it
must
have
meant
in
that
land
of
drought
and
famine
only
a
narrow
strip
of
river
bank
where
a
grain
of
corn
would
grow
and
that
only
when
old
nile
was
kind
if
not
your
nearest
supplies
five
hundred
miles
away
across
the
desert
your
only
means
of
transport
the
camel
your
convoy
must
be
guarded
against
attack
provided
with
provisions
and
water
for
a
two
months
journey
yet
he
never
failed
his
people
fat
year
and
lean
year
my
time
no
man
went
hungry
and
here
with
our
steamships
and
our
railways
with
the
granaries
of
the
world
filled
to
overflowing
one
third
of
our
population
lives
on
the
border
line
of
want
in
india
they
die
by
the
roadside
what
the
good
of
it
all
your
science
and
your
art
and
your
religion
how
can
you
help
men
souls
if
their
bodies
are
starving
a
hungry
man
a
hungry
beast
i
spent
a
week
at
grimsby
some
years
ago
organizing
a
union
they
used
to
throw
the
fish
back
into
the
sea
tons
upon
tons
of
it
that
men
had
risked
their
lives
to
catch
that
would
have
fed
half
london
poor
there
was
a
of
it
they
said
the
want
it
funny
is
it
a
of
food
and
the
kiddies
ca
learn
their
lessons
for
want
of
it
i
was
talking
with
a
farmer
down
in
kent
the
plums
were
rotting
on
his
trees
there
were
too
many
of
them
that
was
the
trouble
the
railway
carriage
alone
would
cost
him
more
than
he
could
get
for
them
they
were
too
cheap
so
nobody
could
have
them
it
the
muddle
of
the
thing
that
makes
me
mad
the
ghastly
way
the
chief
business
of
the
world
is
managed
there
enough
food
could
be
grown
in
this
country
to
feed
all
the
people
and
then
of
the
fragments
each
man
might
gather
his
ten
basketsful
there
no
miracle
needed
i
went
into
the
matter
once
with
dalroy
of
the
board
of
agriculture
he
the
best
man
they
got
if
they
only
listen
to
him
it
never
been
organized
that
all
it
is
the
fault
of
the
individual
it
ought
not
to
be
left
to
the
individual
the
man
who
makes
a
corner
in
wheat
in
chicago
and
condemns
millions
to
privation
likely
enough
he
a
decent
sort
of
fellow
in
himself
a
kind
husband
and
father
would
be
upset
for
the
day
if
he
saw
a
child
crying
for
bread
my
dog
a
decent
enough
little
chap
as
dogs
go
but
i
let
him
run
my
larder
it
could
be
done
with
a
little
good
will
all
round
he
continued
and
nine
men
out
of
every
ten
would
be
the
better
off
but
they
wo
even
let
you
explain
their
newspapers
shout
you
down
it
such
a
damned
fine
world
for
the
few
never
mind
the
many
my
father
was
a
farm
labourer
and
all
his
life
he
never
earned
more
than
thirteen
and
sixpence
a
week
i
left
when
i
was
twelve
and
went
into
the
mines
there
were
six
of
us
children
and
my
mother
brought
us
up
healthy
and
decent
she
fed
us
and
clothed
us
and
sent
us
to
school
and
when
she
died
we
buried
her
with
the
money
she
had
put
by
for
the
purpose
and
never
a
penny
of
charity
had
ever
soiled
her
hands
i
can
see
them
now
talk
of
your
chancellors
of
the
exchequer
and
their
problems
she
worked
herself
to
death
of
course
well
that
all
right
one
does
mind
that
where
one
loves
if
they
would
only
let
you
she
had
no
opposition
to
contend
with
no
thwarting
and
hampering
at
every
turn
the
very
people
you
are
working
for
hounded
on
against
you
the
difficulty
of
a
man
like
myself
who
wants
to
do
something
who
could
do
something
is
that
for
the
best
part
of
his
life
he
is
fighting
to
be
allowed
to
do
it
by
the
time
i
lived
down
their
lies
and
got
my
chance
my
energy
will
be
gone
he
knocked
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
relit
it
i
no
quarrel
with
the
rich
he
said
i
do
care
how
many
rich
men
there
are
so
long
as
there
are
no
poor
who
does
i
was
riding
on
a
bus
the
other
day
and
there
was
a
man
beside
me
with
a
bandaged
head
he
been
hurt
in
that
railway
smash
at
morpeth
he
had
claimed
damages
from
the
railway
company
and
was
going
to
it
only
a
few
scratches
he
said
be
hit
hard
enough
as
it
is
if
been
a
poor
devil
on
eighteen
shillings
a
week
it
would
have
been
different
he
was
an
engineer
earning
good
wages
so
he
was
feeling
sore
and
bitter
against
half
the
world
suppose
you
tried
to
run
an
army
with
your
men
half
starved
while
your
officers
had
more
than
they
could
eat
it
been
tried
and
what
been
the
result
see
that
your
soldiers
have
their
proper
rations
and
the
general
can
sit
down
to
his
dinner
if
he
will
they
are
not
begrudging
it
to
him
a
nation
works
on
its
stomach
underfeed
your
rank
and
file
and
what
sort
of
a
fight
are
you
going
to
put
up
against
your
rivals
i
want
to
see
england
going
ahead
i
want
to
see
her
workers
properly
fed
i
want
to
see
the
corn
upon
her
unused
acres
the
cattle
grazing
on
her
wasted
pastures
i
object
to
the
food
being
thrown
into
the
sea
left
to
rot
upon
the
ground
while
men
are
hungry
in
chicago
while
the
children
grow
up
stunted
i
want
the
commissariat
properly
organized
he
had
been
staring
through
her
rather
than
at
her
so
it
had
seemed
to
joan
suddenly
their
eyes
met
and
he
broke
into
a
smile
i
so
awfully
sorry
he
said
i
been
talking
to
you
as
if
you
were
a
public
meeting
i
afraid
i
more
used
to
them
than
i
am
to
women
please
forgive
me
the
whole
man
had
changed
the
eyes
had
a
timid
pleading
in
them
joan
laughed
i
been
feeling
as
if
i
were
the
king
of
bavaria
she
said
how
did
he
feel
he
asked
her
leaning
forward
he
had
his
own
private
theatre
joan
explained
where
wagner
gave
his
operas
and
the
king
was
the
sole
audience
i
should
have
hated
that
he
said
if
i
had
been
wagner
he
looked
at
her
and
a
flush
passed
over
his
boyish
face
all
right
he
said
if
it
had
been
a
queen
joan
found
herself
tracing
patterns
with
her
spoon
upon
the
tablecloth
but
you
have
won
now
she
said
still
absorbed
apparently
with
her
drawing
you
are
going
to
get
your
chance
he
gave
a
short
laugh
a
trick
he
said
to
weaken
me
they
think
to
shave
my
locks
show
me
to
the
people
bound
by
their
red
tape
to
put
it
another
way
a
rat
among
the
terriers
joan
laughed
you
do
somehow
suggest
the
rat
she
said
rather
another
sort
of
beast
what
do
you
advise
me
he
asked
i
have
decided
yet
they
were
speaking
in
whispered
tones
through
the
open
doors
they
could
see
into
the
other
room
phillips
under
airlie
instructions
was
venturing
upon
a
cigarette
to
accept
she
answered
they
wo
influence
you
the
terriers
as
you
call
them
you
are
too
strong
it
is
you
who
will
sway
them
it
is
as
if
you
were
a
mere
agitator
take
this
opportunity
of
showing
them
that
you
can
build
plan
organize
that
you
were
meant
to
be
a
ruler
you
ca
succeed
without
them
as
things
are
you
got
to
win
them
over
prove
to
them
that
they
can
trust
you
he
sat
for
a
minute
tattooing
with
his
fingers
on
the
table
before
speaking
it
the
frills
and
flummery
part
of
it
that
frightens
me
he
said
you
would
think
that
sensitiveness
was
my
weak
point
but
it
is
i
stood
up
to
a
birmingham
mob
that
was
waiting
to
lynch
me
and
enjoyed
the
experience
but
i
run
ten
miles
rather
than
face
a
room
of
people
with
their
masked
faces
and
ironic
courtesies
it
leaves
me
for
days
feeling
like
a
lobster
that
has
lost
its
shell
i
would
say
it
if
i
did
mean
it
answered
joan
but
you
got
to
trouble
yourself
about
that
you
quite
passable
she
smiled
it
seemed
to
her
that
most
women
would
find
him
more
than
passable
he
shook
his
head
with
you
he
said
there
something
about
you
that
makes
one
ashamed
of
worrying
about
the
little
things
but
the
others
the
sneering
women
and
the
men
who
wink
over
their
shoulder
while
they
talk
to
you
i
shall
never
be
able
to
get
away
from
them
and
of
course
wherever
i
go
he
stopped
abruptly
with
a
sudden
tightening
of
the
lips
joan
followed
his
eyes
phillips
had
swallowed
the
smoke
and
was
giggling
and
spluttering
by
turns
the
yellow
ostrich
feather
had
worked
itself
loose
and
was
rocking
to
and
fro
as
if
in
a
fit
of
laughter
of
its
own
he
pushed
back
his
chair
and
rose
shall
we
join
the
others
he
said
he
moved
so
that
he
was
between
her
and
the
other
room
his
back
to
the
open
doors
you
think
i
ought
to
he
said
yes
she
answered
firmly
as
if
she
were
giving
a
command
but
he
read
pity
also
in
her
eyes
well
have
you
two
settled
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
is
it
all
decided
asked
airlie
yes
he
answered
laughing
we
are
going
to
say
to
the
people
drink
and
be
wise
he
rearranged
his
wife
feather
and
smoothed
her
tumbled
hair
she
looked
up
at
him
and
smiled
joan
set
herself
to
make
mckean
talk
and
after
a
time
succeeded
they
had
a
mutual
friend
a
youth
she
had
met
at
cambridge
he
was
engaged
to
mckean
sister
his
eyes
lighted
up
when
he
spoke
of
his
sister
jenny
the
little
mother
he
called
her
she
the
most
beautiful
body
in
all
the
world
he
said
though
merely
seeing
her
you
might
know
it
he
saw
her
home
and
went
on
up
the
stairs
to
his
own
floor
joan
stood
for
a
while
in
front
of
the
glass
before
undressing
but
felt
less
satisfied
with
herself
she
replaced
the
star
in
its
case
and
took
off
the
dress
with
the
golden
girdle
and
laid
it
carelessly
aside
she
seemed
to
be
growing
smaller
in
her
white
night
dress
with
her
hair
in
two
long
plaits
she
looked
at
herself
once
more
she
seemed
to
be
no
one
of
any
importance
at
all
just
a
long
little
girl
going
to
bed
with
no
one
to
kiss
her
good
night
she
blew
out
the
candle
and
climbed
into
the
big
bed
feeling
very
lonesome
as
she
used
to
when
a
child
it
had
not
troubled
her
until
night
suddenly
she
sat
up
again
she
need
be
back
in
london
before
tuesday
evening
and
was
only
friday
she
would
run
down
home
and
burst
in
upon
her
father
he
would
be
so
pleased
to
see
her
she
would
make
him
put
his
arms
around
her
chapter
viii
she
reached
home
in
the
evening
she
thought
to
find
her
father
in
his
study
but
they
told
her
that
now
he
usually
sat
alone
in
the
great
she
opened
the
door
softly
the
room
was
dark
save
for
a
flicker
of
firelight
she
could
see
nothing
nor
was
there
any
sound
dad
she
cried
are
you
here
he
rose
slowly
from
a
chair
beside
the
fire
it
is
you
he
said
he
seemed
a
little
dazed
she
ran
to
him
and
seizing
his
listless
arms
put
them
round
her
give
me
a
hug
dad
she
commanded
a
real
hug
he
held
her
to
him
for
what
seemed
a
long
while
there
was
strength
in
his
arms
in
spite
of
the
bowed
shoulders
and
white
hair
i
was
afraid
you
had
forgotten
how
to
do
it
she
laughed
when
at
last
he
released
her
do
you
know
you
have
hugged
me
dad
since
i
was
five
years
old
that
nineteen
years
ago
you
do
love
me
do
you
yes
he
answered
i
have
always
loved
you
she
would
not
let
him
light
the
gas
i
have
dined
in
the
train
she
explained
let
us
talk
by
the
firelight
she
forced
him
gently
back
into
his
chair
and
seated
herself
upon
the
floor
between
his
knees
what
were
you
thinking
of
when
i
came
in
she
asked
you
were
asleep
were
you
no
he
answered
not
that
sort
of
sleep
she
could
not
see
his
face
but
she
guessed
his
meaning
am
i
very
like
her
she
asked
yes
he
answered
marvellously
like
her
as
she
used
to
be
except
for
just
one
thing
perhaps
that
will
come
to
you
later
i
thought
for
the
moment
as
you
stood
there
by
the
door
he
did
not
finish
the
sentence
tell
me
about
her
she
said
i
never
knew
she
had
been
an
actress
he
did
not
ask
her
how
she
had
learnt
it
she
gave
it
up
when
we
were
married
he
said
the
people
she
would
have
to
live
among
would
have
looked
askance
at
her
if
they
had
known
there
seemed
no
reason
why
they
should
how
did
it
all
happen
she
persisted
was
it
very
beautiful
in
the
beginning
she
wished
she
had
not
added
that
last
the
words
had
slipped
from
her
before
she
knew
very
beautiful
he
answered
in
the
beginning
it
was
my
fault
he
went
on
that
it
was
not
beautiful
all
through
i
ought
to
have
let
her
take
up
her
work
again
as
she
wished
to
when
she
found
what
giving
it
up
meant
to
her
the
world
was
narrower
then
than
it
is
now
and
i
listened
to
the
world
i
thought
it
another
voice
it
difficult
to
tell
is
it
she
said
i
wonder
how
one
can
he
did
not
answer
and
they
sat
for
a
time
in
silence
did
you
ever
see
her
act
asked
joan
every
evening
for
about
six
months
he
answered
a
little
flame
shot
up
and
showed
a
smile
upon
his
face
i
owe
to
her
all
the
charity
and
tenderness
i
know
she
taught
it
to
me
in
those
months
i
might
have
learned
more
if
i
had
let
her
go
on
teaching
it
was
the
only
way
she
knew
joan
watched
her
as
gradually
she
shaped
herself
out
of
the
shadows
the
poor
thin
fretful
lady
of
the
ever
restless
hands
with
her
bursts
of
jealous
passion
her
long
moods
of
sullen
indifference
all
her
music
turned
to
waste
how
did
she
come
to
fall
in
love
with
you
asked
joan
i
do
mean
to
be
uncomplimentary
dad
she
laughed
taking
his
hand
in
hers
and
stroking
it
you
must
have
been
ridiculously
handsome
when
you
were
young
and
you
must
always
have
been
strong
and
brave
and
clever
i
can
see
such
a
lot
of
women
falling
in
love
with
you
but
not
the
artistic
woman
it
was
so
incongruous
at
the
time
he
answered
my
father
had
sent
me
out
to
america
to
superintend
a
contract
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
been
away
from
home
though
i
was
nearly
thirty
and
all
my
youth
rushed
out
of
me
at
once
it
was
a
fellow
mad
with
the
joy
of
life
that
made
love
to
her
not
the
man
who
went
out
nor
the
man
who
came
back
it
was
at
san
francisco
that
i
met
her
she
was
touring
the
western
states
and
i
let
everything
go
to
the
wind
and
followed
her
it
seemed
to
me
that
heaven
had
opened
up
to
me
i
fought
a
duel
in
colorado
with
a
man
who
had
insulted
her
the
law
did
run
there
in
those
days
and
three
of
his
hired
gunmen
as
they
called
them
held
us
up
that
night
in
the
train
and
gave
her
the
alternative
of
going
back
with
them
and
kissing
him
or
seeing
me
dead
at
her
feet
i
give
her
time
to
answer
nor
for
them
to
finish
it
seemed
a
fine
death
anyhow
that
and
i
have
faced
hell
itself
for
the
chance
of
fighting
for
her
though
she
told
me
afterwards
that
if
i
died
she
have
gone
back
with
them
and
killed
him
joan
did
not
speak
for
a
time
she
could
see
him
grave
a
little
pompous
in
his
sunday
black
his
footsteps
creaking
down
the
aisle
the
collecting
bag
held
stiffly
in
his
hand
could
you
have
saved
a
bit
daddy
she
asked
of
all
that
wealth
of
youth
just
enough
to
live
on
i
might
he
answered
if
i
had
known
the
value
of
it
i
found
a
cable
waiting
for
me
in
new
york
my
father
had
been
dead
a
month
and
i
had
to
return
immediately
and
so
you
married
her
and
took
her
drum
away
from
her
said
joan
oh
the
thing
god
gives
to
some
of
us
she
explained
to
make
a
little
noise
with
and
set
the
people
marching
the
little
flame
died
out
she
could
feel
his
body
trembling
but
you
still
loved
her
did
you
dad
she
asked
i
was
very
little
at
the
time
but
i
can
just
remember
you
seemed
so
happy
together
till
her
illness
came
it
was
more
than
love
he
answered
it
was
idolatry
god
punished
me
for
it
he
was
a
hard
god
my
god
she
raised
herself
putting
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
so
that
her
face
was
very
close
to
his
what
has
become
of
him
dad
she
said
she
spoke
in
a
cold
voice
as
one
does
of
a
false
friend
i
do
not
know
he
answered
her
i
do
seem
to
care
he
must
be
somewhere
she
said
the
living
god
of
love
and
hope
the
god
that
christ
believed
in
they
were
his
last
words
too
he
answered
god
my
god
why
hast
thou
forsaken
me
no
not
his
last
said
joan
i
am
with
you
always
even
unto
the
end
of
the
world
love
was
christ
god
he
will
help
us
to
find
him
their
arms
were
about
one
another
joan
felt
that
a
new
need
had
been
born
in
her
the
need
of
loving
and
of
being
loved
it
was
good
to
lay
her
head
upon
his
breast
and
know
that
he
was
glad
of
her
coming
he
asked
her
questions
about
herself
but
she
could
see
that
he
was
tired
so
she
told
him
it
was
too
important
a
matter
to
start
upon
so
late
she
would
talk
about
herself
it
would
be
sunday
do
you
still
go
to
the
chapel
she
asked
him
a
little
hesitatingly
yes
he
answered
one
lives
by
habit
it
is
the
only
temple
i
know
he
continued
after
a
moment
perhaps
god
one
day
will
find
me
there
he
rose
and
lit
the
gas
and
a
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
caught
his
eye
have
you
heard
from
arthur
he
asked
suddenly
turning
to
her
no
not
since
about
a
month
she
answered
why
he
will
be
pleased
to
find
you
here
waiting
for
him
he
said
with
a
smile
handing
her
the
letter
he
will
be
here
some
time
arthur
allway
was
her
cousin
the
son
of
a
nonconformist
minister
her
father
had
taken
him
into
the
works
and
for
the
last
three
years
he
had
been
in
egypt
helping
in
the
laying
of
a
tramway
line
he
was
in
love
with
her
at
least
so
they
all
told
her
and
his
letters
were
certainly
somewhat
committal
joan
replied
to
them
when
she
did
not
forget
to
do
so
in
a
studiously
sisterly
vein
and
always
reproved
him
for
unnecessary
extravagance
whenever
he
sent
her
a
present
the
letter
announced
his
arrival
at
southampton
he
would
stop
at
birmingham
where
his
parents
lived
for
a
couple
of
days
and
be
in
liverpool
on
sunday
evening
so
as
to
be
able
to
get
straight
to
business
on
monday
morning
joan
handed
back
the
letter
it
contained
nothing
else
it
only
came
an
hour
or
two
ago
her
father
explained
if
he
wrote
to
you
by
the
same
post
you
may
have
left
before
it
arrived
so
long
as
he
does
think
that
i
came
down
specially
to
see
him
i
do
mind
said
joan
they
both
laughed
he
a
good
lad
said
her
father
they
kissed
good
night
and
joan
went
up
to
her
own
room
she
found
it
just
as
she
had
left
it
a
bunch
of
roses
stood
upon
the
her
father
would
never
let
anyone
cut
his
roses
but
himself
young
allway
arrived
just
as
joan
and
her
father
had
sat
down
to
supper
a
place
had
been
laid
for
him
he
flushed
with
pleasure
at
seeing
her
but
was
not
surprised
i
called
at
your
diggings
he
said
i
had
to
go
through
london
they
told
me
you
had
started
it
is
good
of
you
no
it
is
said
joan
i
came
down
to
see
dad
i
did
know
you
were
back
she
spoke
with
some
asperity
and
his
face
fell
how
are
you
she
added
holding
out
her
hand
you
grown
quite
looking
i
like
your
moustache
and
he
flushed
again
with
pleasure
he
had
a
sweet
almost
girlish
face
with
delicate
skin
that
the
egyptian
sun
had
deepened
into
ruddiness
with
soft
dreamy
eyes
and
golden
hair
he
looked
lithe
and
agile
rather
than
strong
he
was
shy
at
first
but
once
set
going
talked
freely
and
was
interesting
his
work
had
taken
him
into
the
desert
far
from
the
beaten
tracks
he
described
the
life
of
the
people
very
little
different
from
what
it
must
have
been
in
noah
time
for
months
he
had
been
the
only
white
man
there
and
had
lived
among
them
what
had
struck
him
was
how
little
he
had
missed
all
the
paraphernalia
of
civilization
once
he
had
got
over
the
first
shock
he
had
learnt
their
sports
and
games
wrestled
and
swum
and
hunted
with
them
provided
one
was
a
little
hungry
and
tired
with
toil
a
stew
of
goat
flesh
with
sweet
cakes
and
fruits
washed
down
with
wine
out
of
a
sheep
skin
made
a
feast
and
after
there
was
music
and
singing
and
dancing
or
the
travelling
would
gather
round
him
his
rapt
audience
paris
had
only
robbed
women
of
their
grace
and
dignity
he
preferred
the
young
girls
in
their
costume
of
the
fourteenth
dynasty
progress
he
thought
had
tended
only
to
complicate
life
and
render
it
less
enjoyable
all
the
essentials
of
happiness
love
courtship
marriage
the
home
children
friendship
social
intercourse
and
play
were
independent
of
it
had
always
been
there
for
the
asking
joan
thought
his
mistake
lay
in
regarding
man
happiness
as
more
important
to
him
than
his
it
was
not
what
we
got
out
of
civilization
but
what
we
put
into
it
that
was
our
gain
its
luxuries
and
ostentations
were
in
themselves
perhaps
bad
for
us
but
the
pursuit
of
them
was
good
it
called
forth
thought
and
effort
sharpened
our
wits
strengthened
our
brains
primitive
man
content
with
his
necessities
would
never
have
produced
genius
art
literature
science
would
have
been
stillborn
he
hesitated
before
replying
glancing
at
her
furtively
while
crumbling
his
bread
when
he
did
it
was
in
the
tone
that
one
of
her
younger
disciples
might
have
ventured
into
a
discussion
with
hypatia
but
he
stuck
to
his
guns
how
did
she
account
for
david
and
solomon
moses
and
the
prophets
they
had
sprung
from
a
shepherd
race
yet
surely
there
was
genius
literature
greece
owed
nothing
to
progress
she
had
preceded
it
her
thinkers
her
poets
her
scientists
had
draws
their
inspiration
from
nature
not
civilization
her
art
had
sprung
full
grown
out
of
the
soil
we
had
never
surpassed
it
but
the
greek
ideal
could
not
have
been
the
right
one
or
greece
would
not
so
utterly
have
disappeared
suggested
allway
unless
you
reject
the
law
of
the
survival
of
the
fittest
he
had
no
qualms
about
arguing
with
his
uncle
so
did
archimedes
disappear
he
answered
with
a
smile
the
nameless
roman
soldier
remained
that
was
hardly
the
survival
of
the
fittest
he
thought
it
the
tragedy
of
the
world
that
rome
had
conquered
greece
imposing
her
lower
ideals
upon
the
race
rome
should
have
been
the
servant
of
greece
the
hands
directed
by
the
brain
she
would
have
made
roads
and
harbours
conducted
the
traffic
reared
the
market
place
she
knew
of
the
steam
engine
employed
it
for
pumping
water
in
the
age
of
the
antonines
sooner
or
later
she
would
have
placed
it
on
rails
and
in
ships
rome
should
have
been
the
policeman
keeping
the
world
in
order
making
it
a
fit
habitation
her
mistake
was
in
regarding
these
things
as
an
end
in
themselves
dreaming
of
nothing
beyond
from
her
we
had
inherited
the
fallacy
that
man
was
made
for
the
world
not
the
world
for
man
rome
organized
only
for
man
body
greece
would
have
legislated
for
his
soul
they
went
into
the
her
father
asked
her
to
sing
and
arthur
opened
the
piano
for
her
and
lit
the
candles
she
chose
some
ballads
and
a
song
of
herrick
playing
her
own
accompaniment
while
arthur
turned
the
leaves
she
had
a
good
voice
a
low
contralto
the
room
was
high
and
dimly
lighted
it
looked
larger
than
it
really
was
her
father
sat
in
his
usual
chair
beside
the
fire
and
listened
with
eyes
glancing
now
and
then
across
at
him
she
was
reminded
of
picture
she
was
feeling
sentimental
a
novel
sensation
to
her
she
rather
enjoyed
it
she
finished
with
one
of
burns
lyrics
and
then
told
arthur
that
it
was
now
his
turn
and
that
she
would
play
for
him
he
shook
his
head
pleading
that
he
was
out
of
practice
i
wish
it
she
said
speaking
low
and
it
pleased
her
that
he
made
no
answer
but
to
ask
her
what
he
should
sing
he
had
a
light
tenor
voice
it
was
wobbly
at
first
but
improved
as
he
went
on
they
ended
with
a
duet
the
next
morning
she
went
into
town
with
them
she
never
seemed
to
have
any
time
in
london
and
wanted
to
do
some
shopping
they
joined
her
again
for
lunch
and
afterwards
at
her
father
suggestion
she
and
arthur
went
for
a
walk
they
took
the
tram
out
of
the
city
and
struck
into
the
country
the
leaves
still
lingered
brown
and
red
upon
the
trees
he
carried
her
cloak
and
opened
gates
for
her
and
held
back
brambles
while
she
passed
she
had
always
been
indifferent
to
these
small
gallantries
but
she
welcomed
them
she
wished
to
feel
her
power
to
attract
and
command
they
avoided
all
subjects
on
which
they
could
differ
even
in
words
they
talked
of
people
and
places
they
had
known
together
they
remembered
their
common
love
of
animals
and
told
of
the
comedies
and
tragedies
that
had
befallen
their
pets
joan
regret
was
that
she
had
not
now
even
a
dog
thinking
it
cruel
to
keep
them
in
london
she
hated
the
women
she
met
dragging
the
poor
little
depressed
beasts
about
at
the
end
of
a
string
savage
with
them
if
they
dared
to
stop
for
a
moment
to
exchange
a
passing
wag
of
the
tail
with
some
other
little
lonely
sufferer
it
was
as
bad
as
keeping
a
lark
in
a
cage
she
had
tried
a
cat
but
so
often
she
did
not
get
home
till
late
and
that
was
just
the
time
when
the
cat
wanted
to
be
out
so
that
they
seldom
met
he
suggested
a
parrot
his
experience
of
them
was
that
they
had
no
regular
hours
and
would
willingly
sit
up
all
night
if
encouraged
and
talk
all
the
time
joan
objection
to
running
a
parrot
was
that
it
stamped
you
as
an
old
maid
and
she
was
that
at
least
not
yet
she
wondered
if
she
could
make
an
owl
really
happy
minerva
had
an
owl
he
told
her
how
one
spring
walking
across
a
common
after
a
fire
he
had
found
a
mother
thrush
burnt
to
death
upon
her
nest
her
charred
wings
spread
out
in
a
vain
endeavour
to
protect
her
brood
he
had
buried
her
there
among
the
blackened
thorn
and
furze
and
placed
a
little
cross
of
stones
above
her
i
hope
nobody
saw
me
he
said
with
a
laugh
but
i
could
bear
to
leave
her
there
unhonoured
it
one
of
the
things
that
make
me
less
certain
than
i
want
to
be
of
a
future
existence
said
joan
the
thought
that
animals
can
have
no
part
in
it
that
all
their
courage
and
love
and
faithfulness
dies
with
them
and
is
wasted
are
you
sure
it
is
he
answered
it
would
be
so
unreasonable
they
had
tea
at
an
inn
beside
a
stream
it
was
a
favourite
resort
in
summer
time
but
now
they
had
it
to
themselves
the
wind
had
played
pranks
with
her
hair
and
he
found
a
mirror
and
knelt
before
her
holding
it
she
stood
erect
looking
down
at
him
while
seeming
to
be
absorbed
in
the
rearrangement
of
her
hair
feeling
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
she
was
encouraging
him
there
was
no
other
word
for
it
she
seemed
to
have
developed
a
sudden
penchant
for
this
sort
of
thing
it
would
end
in
his
proposing
to
her
and
then
she
would
have
to
tell
him
that
she
cared
for
him
only
in
a
cousinly
sort
of
way
whatever
that
might
mean
and
that
she
could
never
marry
him
she
dared
not
ask
herself
why
she
must
manoeuvre
to
put
it
off
as
long
as
possible
and
meanwhile
some
opening
might
occur
to
enlighten
him
she
would
talk
to
him
about
her
work
and
explain
to
him
how
she
had
determined
to
devote
her
life
to
it
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
distractions
if
then
he
chose
to
go
on
loving
her
or
if
he
could
help
it
that
would
not
be
her
fault
after
all
it
did
him
no
harm
she
could
always
be
gracious
and
kind
to
him
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
tricked
him
he
had
always
loved
her
kneeling
before
her
serving
her
it
was
evident
it
made
him
supremely
happy
it
would
be
cruel
of
her
to
end
it
the
landlady
entered
unexpectedly
with
the
tea
but
he
did
not
rise
till
joan
turned
away
nor
did
he
seem
disconcerted
neither
did
the
landlady
she
was
an
elderly
woman
and
had
served
more
than
one
generation
of
young
people
with
their
teas
they
returned
home
by
train
joan
insisted
on
travelling
third
class
and
selected
a
compartment
containing
a
stout
woman
and
two
children
arthur
had
to
be
at
the
works
an
important
contract
had
got
behindhand
and
they
were
working
overtime
she
and
her
father
dined
alone
he
made
her
fulfil
her
promise
to
talk
about
herself
and
she
told
him
all
she
thought
would
interest
him
she
passed
lightly
over
her
acquaintanceship
with
phillips
he
would
regard
it
as
highly
undesirable
she
told
herself
and
it
would
trouble
him
he
was
reading
her
articles
in
the
as
also
her
letters
from
clorinda
and
of
the
two
preferred
the
latter
as
being
less
subversive
of
law
and
order
also
he
did
not
like
seeing
her
photograph
each
week
displayed
across
two
columns
with
her
name
beneath
in
one
inch
type
he
supposed
he
was
fashioned
she
was
getting
rather
tired
of
it
herself
the
editor
insisted
upon
it
she
explained
it
was
worth
it
for
the
opportunity
it
gives
me
i
preach
every
sunday
to
a
congregation
of
over
a
million
souls
it
better
than
being
a
bishop
besides
she
added
the
men
are
just
as
bad
you
see
their
silly
faces
everywhere
that
like
you
women
he
answered
with
a
smile
you
pretend
to
be
superior
and
then
you
copy
us
she
laughed
but
the
next
moment
she
was
serious
no
we
do
she
said
not
those
of
us
who
think
we
know
we
shall
never
oust
man
from
his
place
he
will
always
be
the
greater
we
want
to
help
him
that
all
but
was
that
the
lord
idea
he
said
when
he
gave
eve
to
adam
to
be
his
helpmeet
yes
that
was
all
right
she
answered
he
fashioned
eve
for
adam
and
saw
that
adam
got
her
the
ideal
marriage
might
have
been
the
ideal
solution
if
the
lord
had
intended
that
he
should
have
kept
the
making
in
his
own
hands
not
have
left
it
to
man
somewhere
in
athens
there
must
have
been
the
helpmeet
god
had
made
for
socrates
when
they
met
it
was
xanthippe
that
she
kissed
a
servant
brought
the
coffee
and
went
out
again
her
father
lighted
a
cigar
and
handed
her
the
cigarettes
will
it
shock
you
dad
she
asked
rather
late
in
the
day
for
you
to
worry
yourself
about
that
is
it
he
answered
with
a
smile
he
struck
a
match
and
held
it
for
her
joan
sat
with
her
elbows
on
the
table
and
smoked
in
silence
she
was
thinking
why
had
he
never
brought
her
up
never
exacted
obedience
from
her
never
even
tried
to
influence
her
it
could
not
have
been
mere
weakness
she
stole
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
tired
lined
face
with
its
eyes
she
had
never
seen
them
other
than
calm
but
they
must
have
been
able
to
flash
why
had
he
always
been
so
just
and
kind
and
patient
with
her
why
had
he
never
scolded
her
and
bullied
her
and
teased
her
why
had
he
let
her
go
away
leaving
him
lonely
in
his
empty
voiceless
house
why
had
he
never
made
any
claim
upon
her
the
idea
came
to
her
as
an
inspiration
at
least
it
would
ease
her
conscience
why
do
you
let
arthur
live
here
she
said
instead
of
going
back
to
his
lodgings
it
would
be
company
for
you
he
did
not
answer
for
some
time
she
had
begun
to
wonder
if
he
had
heard
what
do
you
think
of
him
he
said
without
looking
at
her
oh
he
quite
a
nice
lad
she
answered
it
was
some
while
again
before
he
spoke
he
will
be
the
last
of
the
allways
he
said
i
should
like
to
think
of
the
name
being
continued
and
he
a
good
business
man
in
spite
of
his
dreaminess
perhaps
he
would
get
on
better
with
the
men
she
seized
at
the
chance
of
changing
the
subject
it
was
a
foolish
notion
she
said
that
of
the
manchester
school
that
men
and
women
could
be
treated
as
mere
figures
in
a
sum
to
her
surprise
he
agreed
with
her
the
feudal
system
had
a
fine
idea
in
it
he
said
if
it
had
been
honestly
carried
out
a
master
should
be
the
friend
the
helper
of
his
men
they
should
be
one
family
she
looked
at
him
a
little
incredulously
remembering
the
bitter
periods
of
strikes
and
did
you
ever
try
dad
she
asked
oh
yes
he
answered
but
i
tried
the
wrong
way
the
right
way
might
be
found
he
added
by
the
right
man
and
woman
she
felt
that
he
was
watching
her
through
his
eyes
there
are
those
cottages
he
continued
just
before
you
come
to
the
bridge
they
might
be
repaired
and
a
club
house
added
the
idea
is
catching
on
they
tell
me
garden
villages
they
call
them
now
it
gets
the
men
and
women
away
from
the
dirty
streets
and
gives
the
children
a
chance
she
knew
the
place
a
sad
group
of
dilapidated
little
houses
forming
three
sides
of
a
paved
quadrangle
with
a
shattered
fountain
and
withered
trees
in
the
centre
ever
since
she
could
remember
they
had
stood
there
empty
ghostly
with
creaking
doors
and
broken
windows
their
gardens
overgrown
with
weeds
are
they
yours
she
asked
she
had
never
connected
them
with
the
works
some
half
a
mile
away
though
had
she
been
curious
she
might
have
learnt
that
they
were
known
as
allway
folly
your
mother
he
answered
i
built
them
the
year
i
came
back
from
america
and
gave
them
to
her
i
thought
it
would
interest
her
perhaps
it
would
if
i
had
left
her
to
her
own
ways
why
did
they
want
them
she
asked
they
did
at
first
he
answered
the
and
the
hypocrites
among
them
i
made
it
a
condition
that
they
should
be
teetotallers
and
chapel
goers
and
everything
else
that
i
thought
good
for
them
i
thought
that
i
could
save
their
souls
by
bribing
them
with
cheap
rents
and
share
of
profits
and
then
the
union
came
and
that
of
course
finished
it
so
he
too
had
thought
to
build
jerusalem
yes
he
said
i
sound
him
about
giving
up
his
lodgings
joan
lay
awake
for
a
long
while
that
night
the
moon
looked
in
at
the
window
it
seemed
to
have
got
itself
entangled
in
the
tops
of
the
tall
pines
would
it
not
be
her
duty
to
come
back
make
her
father
happy
to
say
nothing
of
the
other
he
was
a
dear
sweet
lovable
lad
together
they
might
realize
her
father
dream
repair
the
blunders
plant
gardens
where
the
weeds
now
grew
drive
out
the
old
sad
ghosts
with
living
voices
it
had
been
a
fine
thought
a
king
thought
others
had
followed
profiting
by
his
mistakes
but
might
it
not
be
carried
further
than
even
they
had
gone
shaped
into
some
noble
venture
that
should
serve
the
future
was
not
her
america
here
why
seek
it
further
what
was
this
unknown
force
that
against
all
sense
and
reason
seemed
driving
her
out
into
the
wilderness
to
preach
might
it
not
be
mere
vanity
mere
egoism
almost
she
had
convinced
herself
and
then
there
flashed
remembrance
of
her
mother
she
too
had
laid
aside
herself
had
thought
that
love
and
duty
could
teach
one
to
be
other
than
one
was
the
ego
was
the
all
important
thing
entrusted
to
us
as
the
talents
of
silver
to
the
faithful
servant
to
be
developed
not
for
our
own
purposes
but
for
the
service
of
the
master
one
did
no
good
by
suppressing
one
nature
in
the
end
it
proved
too
strong
marriage
with
arthur
would
be
only
repeating
the
mistake
to
be
worshipped
to
be
served
it
would
be
very
pleasant
when
one
was
in
the
mood
but
it
would
not
satisfy
her
there
was
something
strong
and
fierce
and
primitive
in
her
nature
something
that
had
come
down
to
her
through
the
generations
from
some
ancestress
something
impelling
her
instinctively
to
choose
the
fighter
to
share
with
him
the
joy
of
battle
healing
his
wounds
giving
him
of
her
courage
exulting
with
him
in
the
victory
the
moon
had
risen
clear
of
the
entangling
pines
it
rode
serene
and
free
her
father
came
to
the
station
with
her
in
the
morning
the
train
was
not
in
and
they
walked
up
and
down
and
talked
suddenly
she
remembered
it
had
slipped
her
mind
could
i
as
a
child
have
known
an
old
clergyman
she
asked
him
at
least
he
would
have
been
old
then
i
dropped
into
chelsea
church
one
evening
and
heard
him
preach
and
on
the
way
home
i
passed
him
again
in
the
street
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
seen
his
face
before
but
not
for
many
years
i
meant
to
write
you
about
it
but
forgot
he
had
to
turn
aside
for
a
moment
to
speak
to
an
acquaintance
about
business
oh
it
possible
he
answered
on
rejoining
her
what
was
his
name
i
do
not
know
she
answered
he
was
not
the
regular
incumbent
but
it
was
someone
that
i
seemed
to
know
quite
well
that
i
must
have
been
familiar
with
it
may
have
been
he
answered
carelessly
though
the
gulf
was
wider
then
than
it
is
now
i
try
and
think
perhaps
it
is
only
your
fancy
the
train
drew
in
and
he
found
her
a
corner
seat
and
stood
talking
by
the
window
about
common
things
what
did
he
preach
about
he
asked
her
unexpectedly
she
was
puzzled
for
the
moment
oh
the
old
clergyman
she
answered
recollecting
oh
calvary
all
roads
lead
to
calvary
he
thought
it
was
rather
interesting
she
looked
back
at
the
end
of
the
platform
he
had
not
moved
chapter
ix
a
pile
of
correspondence
was
awaiting
her
and
standing
by
the
desk
she
began
to
open
and
read
it
suddenly
she
paused
conscious
that
someone
had
entered
the
room
and
turning
she
saw
hilda
she
must
have
left
the
door
ajar
for
she
had
heard
no
sound
the
child
closed
the
door
noiselessly
and
came
across
holding
out
a
letter
papa
told
me
to
give
you
this
the
moment
you
came
in
she
said
joan
had
not
yet
taken
off
her
things
the
child
must
have
been
keeping
a
close
watch
save
for
the
signature
it
contained
but
one
line
i
have
accepted
joan
replaced
the
letter
in
its
envelope
and
laid
it
down
upon
the
desk
unconsciously
a
smile
played
about
her
lips
the
child
was
watching
her
i
glad
you
persuaded
him
she
said
joan
felt
a
flush
mount
to
her
face
she
had
forgotten
hilda
for
the
instant
she
forced
a
laugh
oh
i
only
persuaded
him
to
do
what
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
she
explained
it
was
all
settled
no
it
was
answered
the
child
most
of
them
were
against
it
and
then
there
was
mama
she
added
in
a
lower
tone
what
do
you
mean
asked
joan
did
she
wish
it
the
child
raised
her
eyes
there
was
a
dull
anger
in
them
oh
the
good
of
pretending
she
said
he
so
great
he
could
be
the
prime
minister
of
england
if
he
chose
but
then
he
would
have
to
visit
kings
and
nobles
and
receive
them
at
his
house
and
mama
she
broke
off
with
a
passionate
gesture
of
the
small
thin
hands
joan
was
puzzled
what
to
say
she
knew
exactly
what
she
ought
to
say
what
she
would
have
said
to
any
ordinary
child
but
to
say
it
to
this
uncannily
knowing
little
creature
did
not
promise
much
good
who
told
you
i
persuaded
him
she
asked
nobody
answered
the
child
i
knew
joan
seated
herself
and
drew
the
child
towards
her
it
is
as
terrible
as
you
think
she
said
many
men
who
have
risen
and
taken
a
high
place
in
the
world
were
married
to
kind
good
women
unable
to
share
their
greatness
there
was
shakespeare
you
know
who
married
anne
hathaway
and
had
a
clever
daughter
she
was
just
a
nice
homely
body
a
few
years
older
than
himself
and
he
seems
to
have
been
very
fond
of
her
and
was
always
running
down
to
stratford
to
be
with
her
yes
but
he
did
bring
her
up
to
london
answered
the
child
mama
would
have
wanted
to
come
and
papa
would
have
let
her
and
would
have
gone
to
see
queen
elizabeth
unless
she
had
been
invited
too
joan
wished
she
had
not
mentioned
shakespeare
there
had
surely
been
others
men
who
had
climbed
up
and
carried
their
impossible
wives
with
them
but
she
could
think
of
one
just
then
we
must
help
her
she
answered
somewhat
lamely
she
anxious
to
learn
i
know
the
child
shook
her
head
she
does
understand
she
said
and
papa
wo
tell
her
he
says
it
would
only
hurt
her
and
do
no
good
the
small
hands
were
clenched
i
shall
hate
her
if
she
spoils
his
life
the
atmosphere
was
becoming
tragic
joan
felt
the
need
of
escaping
from
it
she
sprang
up
oh
do
be
nonsensical
she
said
your
father
is
the
only
man
married
to
a
woman
not
as
clever
as
himself
he
is
going
to
let
that
stop
him
and
your
mother
going
to
learn
to
be
the
wife
of
a
great
man
and
do
the
best
she
can
and
if
they
do
like
her
they
got
to
put
up
with
her
i
shall
talk
to
the
both
of
them
a
wave
of
motherliness
towards
the
entire
phillips
family
passed
over
her
it
included
hilda
she
caught
the
child
to
her
and
gave
her
a
hug
you
go
back
to
school
she
said
and
get
on
as
fast
as
you
can
so
that
you
be
able
to
be
useful
to
him
the
child
flung
her
arms
about
her
you
so
beautiful
and
wonderful
she
said
you
can
do
anything
i
so
glad
you
came
joan
laughed
it
was
surprising
how
easily
the
problem
had
been
solved
she
would
take
phillips
in
hand
at
once
at
all
events
she
should
be
wholesome
and
unobtrusive
it
would
be
a
delicate
mission
but
joan
felt
sure
of
her
own
tact
she
could
see
his
boyish
eyes
turned
upon
her
with
wonder
and
gratitude
i
was
so
afraid
you
would
not
be
back
before
i
went
said
the
child
i
ought
to
have
gone
this
afternoon
but
papa
let
me
stay
till
the
evening
you
will
help
she
added
fixing
on
joan
her
great
grave
eyes
joan
promised
and
the
child
went
out
she
looked
pretty
when
she
smiled
she
closed
the
door
behind
her
noiselessly
it
occurred
to
joan
that
she
would
like
to
talk
matters
over
with
greyson
there
was
clorinda
attitude
to
be
decided
upon
and
she
was
interested
to
know
what
view
he
himself
would
take
of
course
he
would
be
on
p
side
the
had
always
supported
the
gas
and
water
school
of
socialism
and
to
include
the
people
food
was
surely
only
an
extension
of
the
principle
she
rang
him
up
and
miss
greyson
answered
asking
her
to
come
round
to
dinner
they
would
be
alone
and
she
agreed
the
greysons
lived
in
a
small
house
squeezed
into
an
angle
of
the
outer
circle
overlooking
regent
park
it
was
charmingly
furnished
chiefly
with
old
chippendale
the
made
quite
a
picture
it
was
and
restful
with
its
faded
colouring
and
absence
of
all
show
and
overcrowding
they
sat
there
after
dinner
and
discussed
joan
news
miss
greyson
was
repairing
a
piece
of
old
embroidery
she
had
brought
back
with
her
from
italy
and
greyson
sat
smoking
with
his
hands
behind
his
head
and
his
long
legs
stretched
out
towards
the
fire
carleton
will
want
him
to
make
his
food
policy
include
tariff
reform
he
said
if
he
prove
pliable
and
is
willing
to
throw
over
his
free
trade
principles
all
well
and
good
what
carleton
got
to
do
with
it
demanded
joan
with
a
note
of
indignation
he
turned
his
head
towards
her
with
an
amused
raising
of
the
eyebrows
carleton
owns
two
london
dailies
he
answered
and
is
in
treaty
for
a
third
together
with
a
dozen
others
scattered
about
the
provinces
most
politicians
find
themselves
sooner
or
later
convinced
by
his
arguments
phillips
may
prove
the
exception
it
would
be
rather
interesting
a
fight
between
them
said
joan
myself
i
should
back
phillips
he
might
win
through
mused
greyson
he
the
man
to
do
it
if
anybody
could
but
the
odds
will
be
against
him
i
do
see
it
said
joan
with
decision
i
afraid
you
have
yet
grasped
the
power
of
the
press
he
answered
with
a
smile
phillips
speaks
occasionally
to
five
thousand
people
carleton
addresses
every
day
a
circle
of
five
million
readers
yes
but
when
phillips
does
speak
he
speaks
to
the
whole
country
retorted
joan
through
the
medium
of
carleton
and
his
like
and
just
so
far
as
they
allow
his
influence
to
permeate
beyond
the
platform
answered
greyson
but
they
report
his
speeches
they
are
bound
to
explained
joan
it
does
read
quite
the
same
he
answered
phillips
goes
home
under
the
impression
that
he
has
made
a
great
success
and
has
roused
the
country
he
and
millions
of
other
readers
learn
from
the
next
headlines
that
it
was
tame
speech
that
he
made
what
sounded
to
him
cheers
have
sunk
to
mild
hears
that
five
hurricane
of
applause
during
which
wildly
excited
men
and
women
leapt
upon
the
benches
and
roared
themselves
hoarse
and
which
he
felt
had
settled
the
whole
question
he
searches
for
in
vain
a
few
silly
interjections
probably
by
carleton
young
lions
become
interruptions
the
report
is
strictly
truthful
but
the
impression
produced
is
that
robert
phillips
has
failed
to
carry
even
his
own
people
with
him
and
then
follow
leaders
in
fourteen
dailies
stretching
from
the
clyde
to
the
severn
foretelling
how
robert
phillips
could
regain
his
waning
popularity
by
the
simple
process
of
adopting
tariff
reform
or
whatever
the
pet
panacea
of
carleton
and
may
at
the
moment
happen
to
be
do
make
us
out
all
alike
pleaded
his
sister
with
a
laugh
there
are
still
a
few
papers
that
do
give
their
opponents
fair
play
they
are
not
increasing
in
numbers
he
answered
and
the
carleton
group
is
there
is
no
reason
why
in
another
ten
years
he
should
not
control
the
entire
popular
press
of
the
country
he
got
the
genius
and
he
got
the
means
the
cleverest
thing
he
has
done
he
continued
turning
to
joan
is
your
up
till
then
the
working
classes
had
escaped
him
with
the
he
has
solved
the
problem
they
open
their
mouths
and
he
gives
them
their
politics
wrapped
up
in
pictures
and
gossipy
pars
miss
greyson
rose
and
put
away
her
embroidery
but
what
his
object
she
said
he
must
have
more
money
than
he
can
spend
and
he
works
like
a
horse
i
could
understand
it
if
he
had
any
beliefs
oh
we
can
all
persuade
ourselves
that
we
are
the
dictator
of
the
human
race
he
answered
love
of
power
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
why
do
our
rockefellers
and
our
carnegies
condemn
themselves
to
the
existence
of
galley
slaves
ruining
their
digestions
so
that
they
never
can
enjoy
a
square
meal
it
is
the
money
it
the
trouble
of
their
lives
how
to
get
rid
of
that
it
is
the
notoriety
the
power
that
they
are
out
for
in
carleton
case
it
is
to
feel
himself
the
power
behind
the
throne
to
know
that
he
can
make
and
unmake
statesmen
has
the
keys
of
peace
and
war
in
his
pocket
is
able
to
exclaim
public
opinion
it
is
i
it
can
be
a
respectable
ambition
suggested
joan
it
has
been
responsible
for
most
of
man
miseries
he
answered
every
world
conqueror
meant
to
make
it
happy
after
he
had
finished
knocking
it
about
we
are
all
born
with
it
thanks
to
the
devil
he
shifted
his
position
and
regarded
her
with
critical
eyes
you
got
it
badly
he
said
i
can
see
it
in
the
tilt
of
your
chin
and
the
quivering
of
your
nostrils
you
beware
of
it
miss
greyson
left
them
she
had
to
finish
an
article
they
debated
clorinda
views
and
agreed
that
as
a
practical
housekeeper
she
would
welcome
attention
being
given
to
the
question
of
the
nation
food
the
would
support
phillips
in
principle
while
reserving
to
itself
the
right
of
criticism
when
it
came
to
details
what
he
like
in
himself
he
asked
her
you
been
seeing
something
of
him
have
you
oh
a
little
she
answered
he
absolutely
sincere
and
he
means
business
he
wo
stop
at
the
bottom
of
the
ladder
now
he
once
got
his
foot
upon
it
but
he
quite
common
is
he
he
asked
again
i
only
met
him
in
public
no
that
precisely
what
he
is
answered
joan
you
feel
that
he
belongs
to
no
class
but
his
own
the
class
of
the
abraham
lincolns
and
the
dantons
england
a
different
proposition
he
mused
society
counts
for
so
much
with
us
i
doubt
if
we
should
accept
even
an
abraham
lincoln
unless
in
some
supreme
crisis
his
wife
rather
handicaps
him
too
does
she
she
was
born
to
be
the
chatelaine
of
downing
street
joan
admitted
but
it
not
an
official
position
i
not
so
sure
that
it
is
he
laughed
it
the
that
rules
in
england
we
settle
everything
round
a
she
was
sitting
in
front
of
the
fire
in
a
chair
she
never
cared
to
loll
and
the
shaded
light
from
the
electric
sconces
upon
the
mantelpiece
illumined
her
if
the
world
were
properly
that
what
you
ought
to
be
he
said
the
wife
of
a
prime
minister
i
can
see
you
giving
such
an
excellent
performance
i
must
talk
to
mary
he
added
see
if
we
ca
get
you
off
on
some
promising
young
under
secretary
do
give
me
ideas
above
my
station
laughed
joan
i
a
journalist
that
the
pity
of
it
he
said
you
wasting
the
most
important
thing
about
you
your
personality
you
would
do
more
good
in
a
room
influencing
the
rulers
than
you
will
ever
do
hiding
behind
a
pen
it
was
the
that
made
the
french
revolution
the
firelight
played
about
her
hair
i
suppose
every
woman
dreams
of
reviving
the
old
french
salon
she
answered
they
must
have
been
gloriously
interesting
he
was
leaning
forward
with
clasped
hands
why
should
she
he
said
the
reason
that
our
have
ceased
to
lead
is
that
our
beautiful
women
are
generally
frivolous
and
our
clever
women
unfeminine
what
we
are
waiting
for
is
an
english
madame
roland
joan
laughed
perhaps
i
shall
some
day
she
answered
he
insisted
on
seeing
her
as
far
as
the
bus
it
was
a
soft
mild
night
and
they
walked
round
the
circle
to
gloucester
gate
he
thought
there
would
be
more
room
in
the
buses
at
that
point
i
wish
you
would
come
oftener
he
said
mary
has
taken
such
a
liking
to
you
if
you
care
to
meet
people
we
can
always
whip
up
somebody
of
interest
she
promised
that
she
would
she
always
felt
curiously
at
home
with
the
greysons
they
were
passing
the
long
sweep
of
chester
terrace
i
like
this
neighbourhood
with
its
early
victorian
atmosphere
she
said
it
always
makes
me
feel
quiet
and
good
i
do
know
why
i
like
the
houses
too
he
said
there
a
character
about
them
you
do
often
find
such
fine
in
london
do
forget
your
promise
he
reminded
her
when
they
parted
i
shall
tell
mary
she
may
write
to
you
she
met
carleton
by
chance
a
day
or
two
later
as
she
was
entering
the
office
i
want
to
see
you
he
said
and
took
her
up
with
him
into
his
room
we
must
stir
the
people
up
about
this
food
business
he
said
plunging
at
once
into
his
subject
phillips
is
quite
right
it
overshadows
everything
we
must
make
the
country
it
can
be
done
and
must
if
a
war
were
to
be
sprung
upon
us
we
could
be
starved
out
in
a
month
our
navy
in
face
of
these
new
submarines
is
no
longer
able
to
secure
us
france
is
working
day
and
night
upon
them
it
may
be
a
bogey
or
it
may
not
if
it
is
she
would
have
us
at
her
mercy
and
it
too
big
a
risk
to
run
you
live
in
the
same
house
with
him
you
do
you
often
see
him
not
often
she
answered
he
was
reading
a
letter
you
were
dining
there
on
friday
night
you
he
asked
her
without
looking
up
joan
flushed
what
did
he
mean
by
her
in
this
way
she
was
not
at
all
used
to
impertinence
from
the
opposite
sex
your
information
is
quite
correct
she
answered
her
anger
betrayed
itself
in
her
tone
and
he
shot
a
swift
glance
at
her
i
did
mean
to
offend
you
he
said
a
mutual
friend
a
airlie
happened
to
be
of
the
party
and
he
mentioned
you
he
threw
aside
the
letter
i
tell
you
what
i
want
you
to
do
he
said
it
nothing
to
object
to
tell
him
that
you
seen
me
and
had
a
talk
i
understand
his
scheme
to
be
that
the
country
should
grow
more
and
more
food
until
it
eventually
becomes
and
that
the
government
should
control
the
distribution
tell
him
that
with
that
heart
and
soul
in
sympathy
and
would
like
to
help
him
he
pushed
aside
a
pile
of
papers
and
leaning
across
the
desk
spoke
with
studied
deliberation
if
he
can
see
his
way
to
making
his
policy
dependent
upon
protection
we
can
work
together
and
if
he
ca
suggested
joan
he
fixed
his
large
colourless
eyes
upon
her
that
where
you
can
help
him
he
answered
if
he
and
i
combine
forces
we
can
pull
this
through
in
spite
of
the
furious
opposition
that
it
is
going
to
arouse
without
a
good
press
he
is
helpless
and
where
is
he
going
to
get
his
press
backing
if
he
turns
me
down
from
half
a
dozen
socialist
papers
whose
support
will
do
him
more
harm
than
good
if
he
will
bring
the
working
class
over
to
protection
i
will
undertake
that
the
tariff
reformers
and
the
agricultural
interest
shall
accept
his
socialism
it
will
be
a
victory
for
both
of
us
if
he
gain
his
end
what
do
the
means
matter
he
continued
as
joan
did
not
answer
food
may
be
dearer
the
unions
can
square
that
by
putting
up
wages
while
the
poor
devil
of
a
farm
labourer
will
at
last
get
fair
treatment
we
can
easily
insist
upon
that
what
do
you
think
yourself
about
protection
she
answered
it
one
of
the
few
subjects
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
he
laughed
you
will
find
all
your
pet
reforms
depend
upon
it
when
you
come
to
work
them
out
he
said
you
ca
have
a
minimum
wage
without
a
minimum
price
they
had
risen
i
give
him
your
message
said
joan
but
i
do
see
him
exchanging
his
principles
even
for
your
support
i
admit
it
important
talk
it
over
with
him
he
said
and
bear
this
in
mind
for
your
own
guidance
he
took
a
step
forward
which
brought
his
face
quite
close
to
hers
if
he
fails
and
all
his
life
work
goes
for
nothing
i
shall
be
sorry
but
i
sha
break
my
heart
he
will
joan
dropped
a
note
into
phillips
on
her
return
home
saying
briefly
that
she
wished
to
see
him
and
he
sent
up
answer
asking
her
if
she
would
come
to
the
gallery
that
evening
and
meet
him
after
his
speech
which
would
be
immediately
following
the
dinner
hour
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
risen
since
his
appointment
and
he
was
received
with
general
cheers
he
stood
out
curiously
youthful
against
the
background
of
and
men
behind
him
and
there
was
youth
also
in
his
clear
ringing
voice
that
not
even
the
atmosphere
of
that
shadowless
chamber
could
altogether
rob
of
its
vitality
he
spoke
simply
and
without
any
attempt
at
rhetoric
relying
chiefly
upon
a
crescendo
of
telling
facts
that
gradually
as
he
proceeded
roused
the
house
to
that
tense
stillness
that
comes
to
it
when
it
begins
to
think
a
distinctly
dangerous
man
joan
overheard
a
little
old
lady
behind
her
comment
to
a
friend
if
i
did
hate
him
i
should
like
him
he
met
her
in
the
corridor
and
they
walked
up
and
down
and
talked
too
absorbed
to
be
aware
of
the
curious
eyes
that
were
turned
upon
them
joan
gave
him
carleton
message
it
was
clever
of
him
to
make
use
of
you
he
said
if
he
sent
it
through
anybody
else
i
have
published
it
you
do
think
it
even
worth
considering
suggested
joan
protection
he
flashed
out
scornfully
yes
i
heard
of
that
listened
as
a
boy
while
the
old
men
told
of
it
to
one
another
in
thin
piping
voices
round
the
fireside
how
the
labourers
were
flung
sixpence
a
week
to
die
on
and
the
men
starved
in
the
towns
while
the
farmers
kept
their
hunters
and
got
drunk
each
night
on
fine
old
crusted
port
do
you
know
what
their
toast
was
in
the
big
hotels
on
market
day
with
the
windows
open
to
the
street
a
long
war
and
a
bloody
one
it
would
be
their
toast
if
they
had
their
way
does
he
think
i
am
going
to
be
a
party
to
the
putting
of
the
people
neck
again
under
their
pitiless
yoke
but
the
people
are
more
powerful
now
argued
joan
if
the
farmer
demanded
higher
prices
they
could
demand
higher
wages
they
would
never
overtake
the
farmer
he
answered
with
a
laugh
and
the
last
word
would
always
be
with
him
i
am
out
to
get
rid
of
the
landlords
he
continued
not
to
establish
them
as
the
permanent
rulers
of
the
country
as
they
are
in
germany
the
people
are
more
powerful
just
a
little
because
they
are
no
longer
dependent
on
the
land
they
can
say
to
the
farmer
right
my
son
if
that
your
figure
i
going
to
the
shop
next
door
to
south
america
to
canada
to
russia
it
is
a
satisfactory
solution
i
want
to
see
england
happy
and
healthy
before
i
bother
about
the
argentine
it
drives
our
men
into
the
slums
when
they
might
be
living
fine
lives
in
god
fresh
air
in
the
case
of
war
it
might
be
disastrous
there
i
agree
with
him
we
must
be
able
to
shut
our
door
without
fear
of
having
to
open
it
ourselves
to
ask
for
bread
how
would
protection
accomplish
that
did
he
tell
you
do
eat
me
laughed
joan
i
have
been
sent
to
you
as
a
missionary
i
only
a
humble
messenger
i
suppose
the
argument
is
that
good
profits
assured
to
him
the
farmer
would
bustle
up
and
produce
more
can
you
see
him
bustling
up
he
answered
with
a
laugh
organizing
himself
into
a
body
and
working
the
thing
out
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
weal
i
tell
you
what
of
him
would
do
grow
just
as
much
or
little
as
suited
his
own
purposes
and
then
go
to
sleep
and
protection
would
be
his
security
against
ever
being
awakened
i
afraid
you
do
like
him
joan
commented
he
will
be
all
right
in
his
proper
place
he
answered
as
the
servant
of
the
public
told
what
to
do
and
turned
out
of
his
job
if
he
do
it
my
scheme
does
depend
upon
protection
you
can
tell
him
that
but
this
time
it
going
to
be
protection
for
the
people
they
were
at
the
far
end
of
the
corridor
and
the
few
others
still
promenading
were
some
distance
away
she
had
not
delivered
the
whole
of
her
message
she
crossed
to
a
seat
and
he
followed
her
she
spoke
with
her
face
turned
away
from
him
you
have
got
to
consider
the
cost
of
refusal
she
said
his
offer
was
help
or
neutrality
it
was
help
or
opposition
by
every
means
in
his
power
he
left
me
in
no
kind
of
doubt
as
to
that
he
not
used
to
being
challenged
and
he
wo
be
squeamish
you
will
have
the
whole
of
his
press
against
you
and
every
other
journalistic
and
political
influence
that
he
possesses
he
getting
a
hold
upon
the
working
classes
the
has
an
enormous
sale
in
the
manufacturing
towns
and
he
talking
of
starting
another
are
you
strong
enough
to
fight
him
she
very
much
wanted
to
look
at
him
but
she
would
not
it
seemed
to
her
quite
a
time
before
he
replied
yes
he
answered
i
strong
enough
to
fight
him
shall
rather
enjoy
doing
it
and
it
time
that
somebody
did
whether
i
strong
enough
to
win
has
got
to
be
seen
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
then
she
wondered
why
she
had
ever
thought
him
ugly
you
can
face
it
she
said
the
possibility
of
all
your
life
work
being
wasted
it
wo
be
wasted
he
answered
the
land
is
there
i
seen
it
from
afar
and
it
a
good
land
a
land
where
no
man
shall
go
hungry
if
not
i
another
shall
lead
the
people
into
it
i
shall
have
prepared
the
way
she
liked
him
for
that
touch
of
exaggeration
she
was
so
tired
of
the
men
who
make
out
all
things
little
including
themselves
and
their
own
work
after
all
was
it
exaggeration
might
he
not
have
been
chosen
to
lead
the
people
out
of
bondage
to
a
land
where
there
should
be
no
more
fear
you
not
angry
with
me
he
asked
i
have
been
rude
have
i
abominably
rude
she
answered
you
defied
my
warnings
and
treated
my
embassy
with
contempt
she
turned
to
him
and
their
eyes
met
i
should
have
despised
you
if
you
had
she
added
there
was
a
note
of
exultation
in
her
voice
and
as
if
in
answer
something
leapt
into
his
eyes
that
seemed
to
claim
her
perhaps
it
was
well
that
just
then
the
bell
rang
for
a
division
and
the
moment
passed
he
rose
and
held
out
his
hand
we
will
fight
him
he
said
and
you
can
tell
him
this
if
he
asks
that
i
going
straight
for
him
parliament
may
as
well
close
down
if
a
few
men
between
them
are
to
be
allowed
to
own
the
entire
press
of
the
country
and
stifle
every
voice
that
does
not
shout
their
bidding
we
have
dethroned
kings
to
put
up
a
newspaper
boss
he
shall
have
all
the
fighting
he
wants
they
met
more
often
from
that
day
for
joan
was
frankly
using
her
two
columns
in
the
to
propagate
his
aims
carleton
to
her
surprise
made
no
objection
nor
did
he
seek
to
learn
the
result
of
his
ultimatum
it
looked
they
thought
as
if
he
had
assumed
acceptance
and
was
willing
for
phillips
to
choose
his
own
occasion
meanwhile
replies
to
her
articles
reached
joan
in
weekly
increasing
numbers
there
seemed
to
be
a
wind
arising
blowing
towards
protection
farm
labourers
especially
appeared
to
be
enthusiastic
for
its
coming
from
their
spelt
smeared
epistles
one
gathered
that
after
years
of
doubt
and
hesitation
they
had
however
reluctantly
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
without
it
there
could
be
no
hope
for
them
factory
workers
miners
engineers
more
fluent
less
apologetic
wrote
as
strong
supporters
of
phillips
scheme
but
saw
clearly
how
upon
protection
its
success
depended
shopmen
clerks
only
occasionally
ungrammatical
felt
sure
that
robert
phillips
the
tried
friend
of
the
poor
would
insist
upon
the
boon
of
protection
being
no
longer
held
back
from
the
people
wives
and
mothers
claimed
it
as
their
children
birthright
similar
views
got
themselves
at
the
same
time
into
the
correspondence
columns
of
carleton
other
numerous
papers
evidently
democracy
had
been
throbbing
with
a
passion
for
protection
hitherto
unknown
even
to
itself
he
means
it
kindly
laughed
phillips
he
is
offering
me
an
excuse
to
surrender
gracefully
we
must
have
a
public
meeting
or
two
after
christmas
and
clear
the
ground
they
had
got
into
the
habit
of
speaking
in
the
plural
phillips
conversion
joan
found
more
difficult
than
she
had
anticipated
she
had
persuaded
phillips
to
take
a
small
house
and
let
her
furnish
it
upon
the
hire
system
joan
went
with
her
to
the
widely
advertised
emporium
in
the
city
road
meaning
to
advise
her
but
in
the
end
she
gave
it
up
out
of
sheer
pity
nor
would
her
advice
have
served
much
purpose
confronted
by
the
rich
and
varied
choice
provided
for
his
patrons
by
krebs
the
furnisher
for
connoisseurs
we
never
had
a
home
exactly
explained
phillips
during
their
journey
in
the
tram
it
always
been
lodgings
up
to
now
nice
enough
some
of
them
but
you
know
what
i
mean
everybody
else
taste
but
your
own
i
always
fancied
a
little
house
with
one
own
things
in
it
you
know
things
that
you
can
get
fond
of
oh
the
things
she
was
going
to
get
fond
of
the
things
that
her
poor
round
foolish
eyes
gloated
upon
the
moment
that
she
saw
them
joan
tried
to
enlist
the
shopman
on
her
side
descending
even
to
flirtation
unfortunately
he
was
a
young
man
with
a
high
sense
of
duty
convinced
that
his
employer
interests
lay
in
his
support
of
phillips
the
sight
of
the
furniture
that
between
them
they
selected
for
the
room
gave
joan
a
quite
distinct
internal
pain
they
ascended
to
the
floor
above
devoted
to
the
exhibition
of
suites
phillips
eye
instinctively
fastened
with
passionate
desire
upon
the
most
atrocious
joan
grew
vehement
it
was
impossible
i
always
was
a
one
for
cheerful
colours
explained
phillips
even
the
shopman
wavered
joan
pressed
her
advantage
directed
phillips
attention
to
something
a
little
less
awful
phillips
yielded
of
course
you
know
best
dear
she
admitted
perhaps
i
am
a
bit
too
fond
of
bright
things
the
victory
was
won
phillips
had
turned
away
the
shopman
was
altering
the
order
joan
moved
towards
the
door
and
accidentally
caught
sight
of
phillips
face
the
flabby
mouth
was
trembling
a
tear
was
running
down
the
painted
cheek
joan
slipped
her
hand
through
the
other
arm
i
not
so
sure
you
not
right
after
all
she
said
fixing
a
critical
eye
upon
the
rival
suites
it
is
a
bit
mousey
that
other
the
order
was
once
more
corrected
joan
had
the
consolation
of
witnessing
the
childish
delight
that
came
again
into
the
foolish
face
but
felt
angry
with
herself
at
her
own
weakness
it
was
the
woman
feebleness
that
irritated
her
if
only
she
had
shown
a
spark
of
fight
joan
could
have
been
firm
poor
feckless
creature
what
could
have
ever
been
her
attraction
for
phillips
she
followed
inwardly
fuming
while
phillips
continued
to
pile
monstrosity
upon
monstrosity
what
would
phillips
think
and
what
would
hilda
eyes
say
when
they
looked
upon
that
suite
hilda
who
would
have
had
no
sentimental
compunctions
the
woman
would
be
sure
to
tell
them
both
that
she
joan
had
accompanied
her
and
helped
in
the
choosing
the
whole
ghastly
house
would
be
exhibited
to
every
visitor
as
the
result
of
their
joint
taste
she
could
hear
airlie
purring
voice
congratulating
her
she
ought
to
have
insisted
on
their
going
to
a
decent
shop
the
mere
advertisement
ought
to
have
forewarned
her
it
was
the
posters
that
had
captured
phillips
those
dazzling
apartments
where
bejewelled
society
reposed
upon
the
but
inexpensive
designs
of
krebs
artists
ought
to
have
more
than
to
sell
their
talents
for
such
purposes
the
contract
was
concluded
in
krebs
private
office
a
very
stout
gentleman
with
a
very
thin
voice
whose
dream
had
always
been
to
one
day
be
of
service
to
the
renowned
robert
phillips
he
was
clearly
under
the
impression
that
he
had
now
accomplished
it
even
as
phillips
took
up
the
pen
to
sign
the
wild
idea
occurred
to
joan
of
snatching
the
paper
away
from
her
hustling
her
into
a
cab
and
in
some
quiet
street
or
square
making
the
woman
see
for
herself
that
she
was
a
useless
fool
that
the
glowing
dreams
and
fancies
she
had
cherished
in
her
silly
head
for
fifteen
years
must
all
be
given
up
that
she
must
stand
aside
knowing
herself
of
no
account
it
could
be
done
she
felt
it
if
only
one
could
summon
up
the
needful
brutality
if
only
one
could
stifle
that
still
small
voice
of
pity
phillips
signed
amid
splutterings
and
blots
joan
added
her
signature
as
witness
she
did
effect
an
improvement
in
the
poor
lady
dress
on
advice
she
took
her
to
a
voluble
little
woman
in
the
earl
court
road
who
was
struck
at
once
by
madame
phillips
remarkable
resemblance
to
the
baroness
von
stein
had
not
joan
noticed
it
whatever
suited
the
baroness
von
stein
allowed
by
common
consent
to
be
one
of
the
women
in
london
was
bound
to
show
up
madame
phillips
to
equal
advantage
by
curious
coincidence
a
costume
for
the
baroness
had
been
put
in
hand
only
the
day
before
it
was
sent
for
and
pinned
upon
the
delighted
madame
phillips
perfection
as
the
baroness
herself
would
always
say
my
frock
must
be
a
framework
for
my
personality
it
must
never
obtrude
the
supremely
woman
one
never
notices
what
she
has
on
that
is
the
test
it
seemed
it
was
what
phillips
had
always
felt
herself
joan
could
have
kissed
the
voluble
emphatic
little
woman
but
the
dyed
hair
and
the
paint
put
up
a
fight
for
themselves
i
want
you
to
do
something
very
brave
said
joan
she
had
invited
herself
to
tea
with
phillips
and
they
were
alone
in
the
small
panelled
room
that
they
were
soon
to
say
to
the
new
house
would
be
ready
at
christmas
it
will
be
a
little
hard
at
first
continued
joan
but
afterwards
you
will
be
glad
that
you
have
done
it
it
is
a
duty
you
owe
to
your
position
as
the
wife
of
a
great
leader
of
the
people
the
firelight
showed
to
joan
a
comically
frightened
face
with
round
staring
eyes
and
an
open
mouth
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
she
faltered
i
want
you
to
be
just
yourself
said
joan
a
kind
good
woman
of
the
people
who
will
win
their
respect
and
set
them
an
example
she
moved
across
and
seating
herself
on
the
arm
of
phillips
chair
touched
lightly
with
her
hand
the
flaxen
hair
and
the
rouged
cheek
i
want
you
to
get
rid
of
all
this
she
whispered
it
is
worthy
of
you
leave
it
to
the
silly
dolls
and
the
bad
women
there
was
a
long
silence
joan
felt
the
tears
trickling
between
her
fingers
you
have
seen
me
came
at
last
in
a
thin
broken
voice
joan
bent
down
and
kissed
her
let
try
it
she
whispered
a
little
choking
sound
was
the
only
answer
but
the
woman
rose
and
joan
following
they
stole
upstairs
into
the
bedroom
and
phillips
turned
the
key
it
took
a
long
time
and
joan
seated
on
the
bed
remembered
a
night
when
she
had
taken
a
trapped
mouse
if
only
he
had
been
a
quiet
mouse
into
the
bathroom
and
had
waited
while
it
drowned
it
was
finished
at
last
and
mrs
phillips
stood
revealed
with
her
hair
down
showing
streaks
of
dingy
brown
joan
tried
to
enthuse
but
the
words
came
haltingly
she
suggested
to
joan
a
candle
that
some
wind
had
suddenly
blown
out
the
paint
and
powder
had
been
obvious
but
at
least
it
had
given
her
the
mask
of
youth
she
looked
old
and
withered
the
life
seemed
to
have
gone
out
of
her
you
see
dear
i
began
when
i
was
young
she
explained
and
he
has
always
seen
me
the
same
i
do
think
i
could
live
like
this
the
painted
doll
that
the
child
fancied
the
paint
washed
off
and
the
golden
hair
all
turned
to
drab
could
one
be
sure
of
getting
used
to
it
of
liking
it
better
and
the
poor
bewildered
doll
itself
how
could
one
expect
to
make
of
it
a
statue
the
woman
of
the
people
one
could
only
bruise
it
it
ended
in
joan
promising
to
introduce
her
to
discreet
theatrical
friends
who
would
tell
her
of
cosmetics
less
injurious
to
the
skin
and
advise
her
generally
in
the
ancient
and
proper
art
of
making
up
it
was
not
the
end
she
had
looked
for
joan
sighed
as
she
closed
her
door
behind
her
what
was
the
meaning
of
it
on
the
one
hand
that
unimpeachable
law
the
greatest
happiness
of
the
greatest
number
the
sacred
cause
of
democracy
the
moral
uplift
of
the
people
sanity
wisdom
truth
the
higher
justice
all
the
forces
on
which
she
was
relying
for
the
regeneration
of
the
world
all
arrayed
in
stern
demand
that
the
flabby
useless
phillips
should
be
sacrificed
for
the
general
good
only
one
voice
had
pleaded
for
foolish
helpless
phillips
and
had
conquered
the
still
small
voice
of
pity
chapter
x
arthur
sprang
himself
upon
her
a
little
before
christmas
he
was
full
of
a
great
project
it
was
that
she
and
her
father
should
spend
christmas
with
his
people
at
birmingham
her
father
thought
he
would
like
to
see
his
brother
they
had
not
often
met
of
late
and
birmingham
would
be
nearer
for
her
than
liverpool
joan
had
no
intention
of
being
lured
into
the
birmingham
parlour
she
thought
she
could
see
in
it
a
scheme
for
her
gradual
entanglement
besides
she
was
highly
displeased
she
had
intended
asking
her
father
to
come
to
brighton
with
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
had
forgotten
all
about
christmas
and
the
idea
only
came
into
her
head
while
explaining
to
arthur
how
his
impulsiveness
had
interfered
with
it
arthur
crestfallen
suggested
telegrams
it
would
be
quite
easy
to
alter
everything
and
of
course
her
father
would
rather
be
with
her
wherever
it
was
but
it
seemed
it
was
too
late
she
ought
to
have
been
consulted
a
sudden
sense
of
proprietorship
in
her
father
came
to
her
assistance
and
added
pathos
to
her
indignation
of
course
now
she
would
have
to
spend
christmas
alone
she
was
far
too
busy
to
think
of
birmingham
she
could
have
managed
brighton
argument
founded
on
the
length
of
journey
to
birmingham
as
compared
with
the
journey
to
brighton
she
refused
to
be
drawn
into
her
feelings
had
been
too
deeply
wounded
to
permit
of
descent
into
detail
but
the
sinner
confessing
his
fault
is
entitled
to
forgiveness
and
having
put
him
back
into
his
proper
place
she
let
him
kiss
her
hand
she
even
went
further
and
let
him
ask
her
out
to
dinner
as
the
result
of
her
failure
to
reform
phillips
she
was
feeling
dissatisfied
with
herself
it
was
an
unpleasant
sensation
and
somewhat
new
to
her
experience
an
evening
spent
in
arthur
company
might
do
her
good
the
experiment
proved
successful
he
really
was
quite
a
dear
boy
eyeing
him
thoughtfully
through
the
smoke
of
her
cigarette
it
occurred
to
her
how
like
he
was
to
guido
painting
of
sebastian
those
soft
dreamy
eyes
and
that
beautiful
almost
feminine
face
there
always
had
been
a
suspicion
of
the
saint
about
him
even
as
a
boy
nothing
one
could
lay
hold
of
just
that
odd
suggestion
of
a
shadow
intervening
between
him
and
the
world
it
seemed
a
favourable
opportunity
to
inform
him
of
that
fixed
determination
of
hers
never
in
all
probability
to
marry
but
to
devote
her
life
to
her
work
she
was
feeling
very
kindly
towards
him
and
was
able
to
soften
her
decision
with
touches
of
gentle
regret
he
did
not
appear
in
the
least
upset
but
that
her
duty
might
demand
later
on
that
she
should
change
her
mind
that
was
if
fate
should
offer
her
some
noble
marriage
giving
her
wider
opportunity
she
was
a
little
piqued
at
his
unexpected
attitude
of
aloofness
what
did
he
mean
by
a
noble
marriage
to
a
duke
or
something
of
that
sort
he
did
not
think
the
candidature
need
be
confined
to
dukes
though
he
had
no
objection
to
a
worthy
duke
he
meant
any
really
great
man
who
would
help
her
and
whom
she
could
help
she
promised
somewhat
shortly
to
consider
the
matter
whenever
the
duke
or
other
class
of
nobleman
should
propose
to
her
at
present
no
sign
of
him
had
appeared
above
the
horizon
her
own
idea
was
that
if
she
lived
long
enough
she
would
become
a
spinster
unless
someone
took
pity
on
her
when
she
was
old
and
decrepit
and
past
her
work
there
was
a
little
humorous
smile
about
his
mouth
but
his
eyes
were
serious
and
pleading
when
shall
i
know
that
you
are
old
and
decrepit
he
asked
she
was
not
quite
sure
she
thought
it
would
be
when
her
hair
was
grey
or
rather
white
she
had
been
informed
by
experts
that
her
peculiar
shade
of
hair
went
white
not
grey
i
shall
ask
you
to
marry
me
when
your
hair
is
white
he
said
may
i
it
did
not
suggest
any
overwhelming
impatience
yes
she
answered
in
case
you
have
married
yourself
and
forgotten
all
about
me
i
shall
keep
you
to
your
promise
he
said
quite
gravely
she
felt
the
time
had
come
to
speak
seriously
i
want
you
to
marry
she
said
and
be
happy
i
shall
be
troubled
if
you
do
he
was
looking
at
her
with
those
shy
worshipping
eyes
of
his
that
always
made
her
marvel
at
her
own
wonderfulness
it
need
not
do
that
he
answered
it
would
be
beautiful
to
be
with
you
always
so
that
i
might
serve
you
but
i
am
quite
happy
loving
you
let
me
see
you
now
and
then
touch
you
and
hear
your
voice
behind
her
lids
she
offered
up
a
little
prayer
that
she
might
always
be
worthy
of
his
homage
she
did
know
it
would
make
no
difference
to
him
she
walked
with
him
to
euston
and
saw
him
into
the
train
he
had
given
up
his
lodgings
and
was
living
with
her
father
at
the
pines
they
were
busy
on
a
plan
for
securing
the
of
the
workmen
and
she
promised
to
run
down
and
hear
all
about
it
she
would
not
change
her
mind
about
birmingham
but
sent
everyone
her
love
she
wished
she
had
gone
when
it
came
to
christmas
day
this
feeling
of
loneliness
was
growing
upon
her
the
phillips
had
gone
up
north
and
the
greysons
to
some
relations
of
theirs
swell
country
people
in
hampshire
flossie
was
on
a
sea
voyage
with
sam
and
his
mother
and
even
madge
had
been
struck
homesick
it
happened
to
be
a
sunday
too
of
all
days
in
the
week
and
london
in
a
drizzling
rain
was
just
about
the
limit
she
worked
till
late
in
the
afternoon
but
sitting
down
to
her
solitary
cup
of
tea
she
felt
she
wanted
to
howl
from
the
basement
came
faint
sounds
of
laughter
her
landlord
and
lady
were
entertaining
guests
if
they
had
not
been
she
would
have
found
some
excuse
for
running
down
and
talking
to
them
if
only
for
a
few
minutes
suddenly
the
vision
of
old
chelsea
church
rose
up
before
her
with
its
little
motherly
old
she
had
so
often
been
meaning
to
go
and
see
her
again
but
something
had
always
interfered
she
hunted
through
her
drawers
and
found
a
comparatively
shawl
and
tucked
it
under
her
cloak
the
service
was
just
commencing
when
she
reached
the
church
mary
stopperton
showed
her
into
a
seat
and
evidently
remembered
her
i
want
to
see
you
afterwards
she
whispered
and
mary
stopperton
had
smiled
and
nodded
the
service
with
its
need
for
being
continually
upon
the
move
bored
her
she
was
not
in
the
mood
for
it
and
the
sermon
preached
by
a
young
curate
who
had
not
yet
got
over
his
oxford
drawl
was
uninteresting
she
had
half
hoped
that
the
wheezy
old
clergyman
who
had
preached
about
calvary
on
the
evening
she
had
first
visited
the
church
would
be
there
again
she
wondered
what
had
become
of
him
and
if
it
were
really
a
fact
that
she
had
known
him
when
she
was
a
child
or
only
her
fancy
it
was
strange
how
vividly
her
memory
of
him
seemed
to
pervade
the
little
church
she
had
the
feeling
he
was
watching
her
from
the
shadows
she
waited
for
mary
in
the
vestibule
and
gave
her
the
shawl
making
her
swear
on
the
big
key
of
the
church
door
that
she
would
wear
it
herself
and
not
give
it
away
the
little
old
pink
and
white
face
flushed
with
delight
as
she
took
it
and
the
thin
hands
fingered
it
admiringly
but
i
may
lend
it
she
pleaded
they
turned
up
church
street
joan
confided
to
mary
what
a
rotten
christmas
she
had
had
all
by
herself
without
a
soul
to
speak
to
except
her
landlady
who
had
brought
her
meals
and
had
been
in
such
haste
to
get
away
i
do
know
what
made
me
think
of
you
she
said
i
so
glad
i
did
she
gave
the
little
old
lady
a
hug
mary
laughed

asked

joan

that

a
friendly
face
i
shall
go
home
and

to
bed
early
they
walked
a
little
way
in
silence
mary
slipped
her
hand
into
joan
you

care
to
come
home
and
have
a
bit
of
supper

little
squeeze

she
said
they

sometimes
of
a
sunday
evening

party
asked
joan
no
dear
answered
mary
it
only
one
or
two
who
have
nowhere
else
to
go
joan
laughed
she
thought
she
would
be
a
fit
candidate
you
see
it
makes
company
for
me
explained
mary
mary
lived
in
a
tiny
house
behind
a
strip
of
garden
it
stood
in
a
narrow
side
street
between
two
and
was
covered
with
ivy
it
had
two
windows
above
and
a
window
and
a
door
below
the
upstairs
rooms
belonged
to
the
churchwardens
and
were
used
as
a
storehouse
for
old
parish
registers
deemed
of
little
value
mary
stopperton
and
her
bedridden
husband
lived
in
the
two
rooms
below
mary
unlocked
the
door
and
joan
passed
in
and
waited
mary
lit
a
candle
that
was
standing
on
a
bracket
and
turned
to
lead
the
way
shall
i
shut
the
door
suggested
joan
mary
blushed
like
a
child
that
has
been
found
out
just
as
it
was
hoping
that
it
had
not
been
noticed
it
does
matter
dearie
she
explained
they
know
if
they
find
it
open
that
i
in
the
little
room
looked
very
cosy
when
mary
had
made
up
the
fire
and
lighted
the
lamp
she
seated
joan
in
the
worn
horsehair
out
of
which
one
had
to
be
careful
one
did
not
slip
on
to
the
floor
and
spread
her
handsome
shawl
over
the
back
of
the
dilapidated
sofa
you
wo
mind
my
running
away
for
a
minute
she
said
i
shall
only
be
in
the
next
room
through
the
thin
partition
joan
heard
a
constant
shrill
complaining
voice
at
times
it
rose
into
an
angry
growl
mary
looked
in
at
the
door
i
just
running
round
to
the
doctor
she
whispered
his
medicine
has
come
i
sha
be
long
joan
offered
to
go
in
and
sit
with
the
invalid
but
mary
feared
the
exertion
of
talking
might
be
too
much
for
him
he
gets
so
excited
she
explained
she
slipped
out
noiselessly
it
seemed
in
spite
of
its
open
door
a
very
silent
little
house
behind
its
strip
of
garden
joan
had
the
feeling
that
it
was
listening
suddenly
she
heard
a
light
step
in
the
passage
and
the
room
door
opened
a
girl
entered
she
was
wearing
a
large
black
hat
and
a
black
boa
round
her
neck
between
them
her
face
shone
unnaturally
white
she
carried
a
small
cloth
bag
she
started
on
seeing
joan
and
seemed
about
to
retreat
oh
please
do
go
cried
joan
stopperton
has
just
gone
round
to
the
doctor
she
wo
be
long
i
a
friend
of
hers
the
girl
took
stock
of
her
and
apparently
reassured
closed
the
door
behind
her
what
he
like
she
asked
with
a
jerk
of
her
head
in
the
direction
of
the
next
room
she
placed
her
bag
carefully
upon
the
sofa
and
examined
the
new
shawl
as
she
did
so
well
i
gather
he
a
little
fretful
answered
joan
with
a
smile
that
a
bad
sign
said
the
girl
means
he
feeling
better
she
seated
herself
on
the
sofa
and
fingered
the
shawl
did
you
give
it
her
she
asked
yes
admitted
joan
i
rather
fancied
her
in
it
she
only
pawn
it
said
the
girl
to
buy
him
grapes
and
port
wine
i
felt
a
bit
afraid
of
her
laughed
joan
so
i
made
her
promise
not
to
part
with
it
is
he
really
very
ill
her
husband
oh
yes
there
no
this
time
answered
the
girl
a
bad
thing
for
her
if
he
was
oh
it
only
what
known
all
over
the
neighbourhood
continued
the
girl
she
had
a
pretty
rough
time
with
him
twice
i
found
her
getting
ready
to
go
to
sleep
for
the
night
by
sitting
on
the
bare
floor
with
her
back
against
the
wall
had
sold
every
stick
in
the
place
and
gone
off
but
she
always
some
excuse
for
him
it
was
sure
to
be
half
her
fault
and
the
other
half
he
could
help
now
she
got
her
according
to
her
own
account
heard
he
was
dying
in
a
and
must
fetch
him
home
and
nurse
him
back
to
life
seems
he
getting
fonder
of
her
every
day
now
that
he
ca
do
anything
else
it
does
seem
to
depress
her
spirits
mused
joan
oh
she
she
all
right
agreed
the
girl
having
the
time
of
her
life
someone
to
look
after
for
hours
a
day
that
ca
help
themselves
she
examined
joan
awhile
in
silence
are
you
on
the
stage
she
asked
no
answered
joan
but
my
mother
was
are
you
thought
you
looked
a
bit
like
it
said
the
girl
i
in
the
chorus
it
better
than
being
in
service
or
in
a
shop
that
all
you
can
say
for
it
but
you
get
out
of
that
suggested
joan
you
got
the
actress
face
the
girl
flushed
with
pleasure
it
was
a
striking
face
with
intelligent
eyes
and
a
mobile
sensitive
mouth
oh
yes
she
said
i
could
act
all
right
i
feel
it
but
you
do
get
out
of
the
chorus
except
at
a
price
joan
looked
at
her
i
thought
that
sort
of
thing
was
dying
out
she
said
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
not
in
my
shop
she
answered
anyhow
it
was
the
only
chance
i
ever
had
wish
sometimes
i
taken
it
it
was
quite
a
good
part
they
must
have
felt
sure
you
could
act
said
joan
next
time
it
will
be
a
clean
offer
the
girl
shook
her
head
there
no
next
time
she
said
once
put
down
as
one
of
the
plenty
of
others
to
take
your
place
oh
i
do
blame
them
she
added
it
is
a
thing
to
be
dismissed
with
a
toss
of
your
head
i
thought
it
all
out
do
know
now
what
decided
me
something
inside
me
i
suppose
joan
found
herself
poking
the
fire
have
you
known
mary
stopperton
long
she
asked
oh
yes
answered
the
girl
ever
since
i
been
on
my
own
did
you
talk
it
over
with
her
asked
joan
no
answered
the
girl
i
may
have
just
told
her
she
is
the
sort
that
gives
advice
i
glad
you
did
do
it
said
joan
that
you
put
up
a
fight
for
all
women
the
girl
gave
a
short
laugh
afraid
i
was
thinking
much
about
that
she
said
no
said
joan
but
perhaps
that
the
way
the
best
fights
are
fought
without
thinking
mary
peeped
round
the
door
she
had
been
lucky
enough
to
find
the
doctor
in
she
disappeared
again
and
they
talked
about
themselves
the
girl
was
a
miss
ensor
she
lived
by
herself
in
a
room
in
lawrence
street
i
not
good
at
getting
on
with
people
she
explained
mary
joined
them
and
went
straight
to
miss
ensor
bag
and
opened
it
she
shook
her
head
at
the
contents
which
consisted
of
a
small
looking
meat
pie
in
a
tin
dish
and
two
pale
flat
mince
tarts
it
does
nourish
you
dearie
complained
mary
you
could
have
bought
yourself
a
nice
bit
of
meat
with
the
same
money
and
you
would
have
had
all
the
trouble
of
cooking
it
answered
the
girl
that
only
wants
warming
up
but
i
like
cooking
you
know
dearie
grumbled
mary
there
no
interest
in
warming
things
up
the
girl
laughed
you
do
have
to
go
far
for
your
fun
she
said
i
bring
a
sole
next
time
and
you
shall
do
it
mary
put
the
pasties
into
the
oven
and
almost
banged
the
door
miss
ensor
proceeded
to
lay
the
table
how
many
do
you
think
she
asked
mary
was
doubtful
she
hoped
that
it
being
christmas
day
they
would
have
somewhere
better
to
go
i
passed
old
and
squeak
just
now
spouting
away
to
three
men
and
a
dog
outside
the
world
end
i
expect
he
turn
up
thought
miss
ensor
she
laid
for
four
leaving
space
for
more
if
need
be
i
call
it
the
arms
she
explained
turning
to
joan
we
bring
our
own
victuals
and
mary
cooks
them
for
us
and
waits
on
us
and
the
more
of
us
the
merrier
you
look
forward
to
your
sunday
evening
parties
you
she
asked
of
mary
mary
laughed
she
was
busy
in
a
corner
with
basins
and
a
saucepan
of
course
i
do
dearie
she
answered
i
always
been
fond
of
company
there
came
another
opening
of
the
door
a
little
hairy
man
entered
he
wore
spectacles
and
was
dressed
in
black
he
carried
a
paper
parcel
which
he
laid
upon
the
table
he
looked
a
little
doubtful
at
joan
mary
introduced
them
his
name
was
julius
simson
he
shook
hands
as
if
under
protest
as
friends
of
mary
stopperton
he
said
we
meet
on
neutral
ground
but
in
all
matters
of
moment
i
expect
we
are
as
far
asunder
as
the
poles
i
stand
for
the
people
we
ought
to
be
comrades
answered
joan
with
a
smile
i
too
am
trying
to
help
the
people
you
and
your
class
said
simson
are
friends
enough
to
the
people
so
long
as
they
remember
that
they
are
the
people
and
keep
their
proper
place
at
the
bottom
i
am
for
putting
the
people
at
the
top
then
they
will
be
the
upper
classes
suggested
joan
and
i
may
still
have
to
go
on
fighting
for
the
rights
of
the
lower
orders
in
this
world
explained
simson
someone
has
got
to
be
master
the
only
question
is
who
mary
had
unwrapped
the
paper
parcel
it
contained
half
a
sheep
head
how
would
you
like
it
done
she
whispered
simson
considered
there
came
a
softer
look
into
his
eyes
how
did
you
do
it
last
time
he
asked
it
came
up
brown
i
remember
with
thick
gravy
braised
suggested
mary
that
the
word
agreed
simson
braised
he
watched
while
mary
took
things
needful
from
the
cupboard
and
commenced
to
peel
an
onion
that
the
sort
that
makes
me
despair
of
the
people
said
simson
joan
could
not
be
sure
whether
he
was
addressing
her
individually
or
imaginary
thousands
likes
working
for
nothing
thinks
she
was
born
to
be
everybody
servant
he
seated
himself
beside
miss
ensor
on
the
antiquated
sofa
it
gave
a
complaining
groan
but
held
out
did
you
have
a
good
house
the
girl
asked
him
saw
you
from
the
distance
waving
your
arms
about
had
time
to
stop
not
many
admitted
simson
a
christmassy
lot
you
know
sort
of
crowd
that
interrupts
you
and
tries
to
be
funny
dead
to
their
own
interests
it
slow
work
why
do
you
do
it
asked
miss
ensor
damned
if
i
know
answered
simson
with
a
burst
of
candour
help
it
i
suppose
lost
me
job
again
the
old
story
suggested
miss
ensor
the
old
story
sighed
simson
one
of
the
customers
happened
to
be
passing
last
wednesday
when
i
was
speaking
on
the
embankment
heard
my
opinion
of
the
middle
classes
well
you
ca
expect
to
like
it
can
you
submitted
miss
ensor
no
admitted
simson
with
generosity
it
only
natural
it
a
fight
to
the
finish
between
me
and
the
bourgeois
i
cover
them
with
ridicule
and
contempt
and
they
hit
back
at
me
in
the
only
way
they
know
take
care
they
do
get
the
best
of
you
miss
ensor
advised
him
oh
i
not
afraid
he
answered
i
get
another
place
all
right
give
me
time
the
only
thing
i
worried
about
is
my
young
woman
does
agree
with
you
inquired
miss
ensor
oh
it
is
that
he
answered
but
she
frightened
you
know
says
life
with
me
is
going
to
be
a
bit
too
uncertain
for
her
perhaps
right
oh
why
do
you
chuck
it
advised
miss
ensor
give
the
bourgeois
a
rest
simson
shook
his
head
somebody
got
to
tackle
them
he
said
tell
them
the
truth
about
themselves
to
their
faces
yes
but
it
need
be
you
suggested
miss
ensor
mary
was
leaning
over
the
table
miss
ensor
veal
and
ham
pie
was
ready
mary
arranged
it
in
front
of
her
eat
it
while
hot
dearie
she
counselled
it
wo
be
so
indigestible
miss
ensor
turned
to
her
oh
you
talk
to
him
she
urged
here
lost
his
job
again
and
is
losing
his
girl
all
because
of
his
silly
politics
tell
him
he
got
to
have
sense
and
stop
it
mary
seemed
troubled
evidently
as
miss
ensor
had
stated
advice
was
not
her
line
perhaps
he
got
to
do
it
dearie
she
suggested
what
do
you
mean
by
got
to
do
it
exclaimed
miss
ensor
who
making
him
do
it
except
himself
mary
flushed
she
seemed
to
want
to
get
back
to
her
cooking
something
inside
us
dearie
she
thought
that
nobody
hears
but
ourselves
that
tells
him
to
talk
all
that
twaddle
demanded
miss
ensor
have
you
heard
him
no
dearie
mary
admitted
but
i
expect
it
got
its
purpose
or
he
would
have
to
do
it
miss
ensor
gave
a
gesture
of
despair
and
applied
herself
to
her
pie
the
hirsute
face
of
simson
had
lost
the
foolish
aggressiveness
that
had
irritated
joan
he
seemed
to
be
pondering
matters
mary
hoped
that
joan
was
hungry
joan
laughed
and
admitted
that
she
was
it
the
smell
of
all
the
nice
things
she
explained
mary
promised
it
should
soon
be
ready
and
went
back
to
her
corner
a
short
dark
man
entered
and
stood
looking
round
the
room
the
frame
must
once
have
been
powerful
but
now
it
was
shrunken
and
emaciated
the
shabby
threadbare
clothes
hung
loosely
from
the
stooping
shoulders
only
the
head
seemed
to
have
retained
its
vigour
the
face
from
which
the
long
black
hair
was
brushed
straight
back
was
ghastly
white
out
of
it
deep
set
beneath
great
shaggy
overhanging
brows
blazed
the
fierce
restless
eyes
of
a
fanatic
the
huge
mouth
seemed
to
have
petrified
itself
into
a
savage
snarl
he
gave
joan
the
idea
as
he
stood
there
glaring
round
him
of
a
hunted
beast
at
bay
miss
ensor
whose
bump
of
reverence
was
undeveloped
greeted
him
cheerfully
as
boanerges
simson
more
respectful
rose
and
offered
his
small
grimy
hand
mary
took
his
hat
and
cloak
away
from
him
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
she
felt
his
hands
and
put
him
into
a
chair
close
to
the
fire
and
then
she
introduced
him
to
joan
joan
started
on
hearing
his
name
it
was
one
well
known
the
cyril
baptiste
she
asked
she
had
often
wondered
what
he
might
be
like
the
cyril
baptiste
he
answered
in
a
low
even
passionate
voice
that
he
flung
at
her
almost
like
a
blow
the
atheist
the
gaol
bird
the
pariah
the
blasphemer
the
i
hoofs
instead
of
feet
shall
i
take
off
my
boots
and
show
them
to
you
i
tuck
my
tail
inside
my
coat
you
ca
see
my
horns
i
cut
them
off
close
to
my
head
that
why
i
wear
my
hair
long
to
hide
the
stumps
mary
had
been
searching
in
the
pockets
of
his
cloak
she
had
found
a
paper
bag
you
must
get
excited
she
said
laying
her
little
worn
hand
upon
his
shoulder
or
you
bring
on
the
bleeding
aye
he
answered
i
must
be
careful
i
do
die
on
christmas
day
it
would
make
a
fine
text
that
for
their
sermons
he
lapsed
into
silence
his
almost
transparent
hands
stretched
out
towards
the
fire
simson
fidgeted
the
quiet
of
the
room
broken
only
by
ministering
activities
evidently
oppressed
him
paper
going
well
sir
he
asked
i
often
read
it
myself
it
still
sells
answered
the
proprietor
and
editor
and
publisher
and
entire
staff
of
i
like
the
articles
you
are
writing
on
the
history
of
superstition
quite
illuminating
remarked
simson
it
many
a
year
i
am
afraid
to
the
final
chapter
thought
their
author
they
afford
much
food
for
reflection
thought
simson
though
i
can
not
myself
go
as
far
as
you
do
in
including
christianity
under
that
heading
mary
frowned
at
him
but
simson
eager
for
argument
or
not
noticing
blundered
on
whether
we
accept
the
miraculous
explanation
of
christ
birth
continued
simson
in
his
best
voice
or
whether
with
the
great
french
writer
whose
name
for
the
moment
escapes
me
we
regard
him
merely
as
a
man
inspired
we
must
i
think
admit
that
his
teaching
has
been
of
help
especially
to
the
poor
the
fanatic
turned
upon
him
so
fiercely
that
simson
arm
involuntarily
assumed
the
posture
of
defence
to
the
poor
the
old
man
almost
shrieked
to
the
poor
that
he
has
robbed
of
all
power
of
resistance
to
oppression
by
his
vile
submissive
creed
that
he
has
drugged
into
passive
acceptance
of
every
evil
done
to
them
by
his
false
promises
that
their
sufferings
here
shall
win
for
them
some
wonderful
reward
when
they
are
dead
what
has
been
his
teaching
to
the
poor
bow
your
backs
to
the
lash
kiss
the
rod
that
scars
your
flesh
be
ye
humble
oh
my
people
be
ye
poor
in
spirit
let
wrong
rule
triumphant
through
the
world
raise
no
hand
against
it
lest
ye
suffer
my
eternal
punishments
learn
from
me
to
be
meek
and
lowly
learn
to
be
good
slaves
and
give
no
trouble
to
your
taskmasters
let
them
turn
the
world
into
a
hell
for
you
the
grave
the
grave
shall
be
your
gate
to
happiness
helpful
to
the
poor
helpful
to
their
rulers
to
their
owners
they
take
good
care
that
christ
shall
be
well
taught
their
fat
priests
shall
bear
his
message
to
the
poor
the
rod
may
be
broken
the
prison
door
be
forced
it
is
christ
that
shall
bind
the
people
in
eternal
fetters
christ
the
lackey
the
jackal
of
the
rich
simson
was
visibly
shocked
evidently
he
was
less
familiar
with
the
opinions
of
than
he
had
thought
i
really
must
protest
exclaimed
simson
to
whatever
wrong
uses
his
words
may
have
been
twisted
christ
himself
i
regard
as
divine
and
entitled
to
be
spoken
of
with
reverence
his
whole
life
his
sufferings
but
the
old
fanatic
vigour
had
not
yet
exhausted
itself
his
sufferings
he
interrupted
does
suffering
entitle
a
man
to
be
regarded
as
divine
if
so
so
also
am
i
a
god
look
at
me
he
stretched
out
his
long
thin
arms
with
their
hands
thrusting
forward
his
great
savage
head
that
the
bony
wizened
throat
seemed
hardly
strong
enough
to
bear
wealth
honour
happiness
i
had
them
once
i
had
wife
children
and
a
home
now
i
creep
an
outcast
keeping
to
the
shadows
and
the
children
in
the
street
throw
stones
at
me
thirty
years
i
have
starved
that
i
might
preach
they
shut
me
in
their
prisons
they
hound
me
into
garrets
they
jibe
at
me
and
mock
me
but
they
can
not
silence
me
what
of
my
life
am
i
divine
miss
ensor
having
finished
her
supper
sat
smoking
why
must
you
preach
she
asked
it
does
seem
to
pay
you
there
was
a
curious
smile
about
the
girl
lips
as
she
caught
joan
eye
he
turned
to
her
with
his
last
flicker
of
passion
because
to
this
end
was
i
born
and
for
this
cause
came
i
into
the
world
that
i
should
bear
witness
unto
the
truth
he
answered
he
sank
back
a
huddled
heap
upon
the
chair
there
was
foam
about
his
mouth
great
beads
of
sweat
upon
his
forehead
mary
wiped
them
away
with
a
corner
of
her
apron
and
felt
again
his
trembling
hands
oh
please
do
talk
to
him
any
more
she
pleaded
not
till
he
had
his
supper
she
fetched
her
fine
shawl
and
pinned
it
round
him
his
eyes
followed
her
as
she
hovered
about
him
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
entered
the
room
they
looked
human
they
gathered
round
the
table
baptiste
was
still
pinned
up
in
mary
bright
shawl
it
lent
him
a
curious
dignity
he
might
have
been
some
ancient
prophet
stepped
from
the
pages
of
the
talmud
miss
ensor
completed
her
supper
with
a
cup
of
tea
and
some
little
cakes
just
to
keep
us
all
company
as
mary
had
insisted
the
old
fanatic
eyes
passed
from
face
to
face
there
was
almost
the
suggestion
of
a
smile
about
the
savage
mouth
a
strange
he
said
cyril
the
apostate
and
julius
who
strove
against
the
high
priests
and
the
pharisees
and
inez
a
dancer
before
the
people
and
joanna
a
daughter
of
the
rulers
gathered
together
in
the
house
of
one
mary
a
servant
of
the
lord
are
you
too
a
christian
he
asked
of
joan
not
yet
answered
joan
but
i
hope
to
be
one
day
she
spoke
without
thinking
not
quite
knowing
what
she
meant
but
it
came
back
to
her
in
after
years
the
talk
grew
lighter
under
the
influence
of
mary
cooking
baptiste
could
be
interesting
when
he
got
away
from
his
fanaticism
and
even
the
apostolic
simson
had
sometimes
noticed
humour
when
it
had
chanced
his
way
a
message
came
for
mary
about
ten
brought
by
a
scared
little
girl
who
whispered
it
to
her
at
the
door
mary
apologized
she
had
to
go
out
the
party
broke
up
mary
disappeared
into
the
next
room
and
returned
in
a
shawl
and
bonnet
carrying
a
small
brown
paper
parcel
joan
walked
with
her
as
far
as
the
king
road
a
little
child
is
coming
she
confided
to
joan
she
was
quite
excited
about
it
joan
thought
it
curious
she
said
one
so
seldom
hears
of
anybody
being
born
on
christmas
day
they
were
passing
a
lamp
joan
had
never
seen
a
face
look
quite
so
happy
as
mary
looked
just
then
it
always
seems
to
me
christ
birthday
she
said
whenever
a
child
is
born
they
had
reached
the
corner
joan
could
see
her
bus
in
the
distance
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
little
withered
face
do
stop
she
whispered
mary
gave
her
a
hug
and
almost
ran
away
joan
watched
the
little
like
figure
growing
smaller
it
glided
in
and
out
among
the
people
chapter
xi
in
the
spring
joan
at
denton
request
undertook
a
mission
it
was
to
go
to
paris
denton
had
meant
to
go
herself
but
was
laid
up
with
sciatica
and
the
matter
she
considered
would
not
brook
of
any
delay
it
rather
a
delicate
business
she
told
joan
she
was
lying
on
a
couch
in
her
great
library
and
joan
was
seated
by
her
side
i
want
someone
who
can
go
into
private
houses
and
mix
with
educated
people
on
their
own
level
and
especially
i
want
you
to
see
one
or
two
women
they
count
in
france
you
know
french
pretty
well
do
you
oh
sufficiently
joan
answered
the
one
thing
her
mother
had
done
for
her
had
been
to
talk
french
with
her
when
she
was
a
child
and
at
girton
she
had
chummed
on
with
a
french
girl
and
made
herself
tolerably
perfect
you
will
not
go
as
a
journalist
continued
denton
but
as
a
personal
friend
of
mine
whose
discretion
i
shall
vouch
for
i
want
you
to
find
out
what
the
people
i
am
sending
you
among
are
thinking
themselves
and
what
they
consider
ought
to
be
done
if
we
are
not
very
careful
on
both
sides
we
shall
have
the
newspapers
whipping
us
into
war
the
perpetual
egyptian
trouble
had
cropped
up
again
and
the
carleton
papers
in
particular
were
already
sounding
the
tocsin
argument
was
that
we
ought
to
fall
upon
france
and
crush
her
before
she
could
develop
her
supposed
submarine
menace
his
flaming
posters
were
at
every
corner
every
obscure
french
newspaper
was
being
ransacked
for
insults
and
pinpricks
a
section
of
the
paris
press
is
doing
all
it
can
to
help
him
of
course
explained
denton
it
does
seem
to
matter
to
them
that
germany
is
only
waiting
her
opportunity
and
that
if
russia
comes
in
it
is
bound
to
bring
austria
europe
will
pay
dearly
one
day
for
the
luxury
of
a
free
press
but
you
surely
not
suggesting
any
other
kind
of
press
at
this
period
of
the
world
history
exclaimed
joan
oh
but
i
am
answered
the
old
lady
with
a
grim
tightening
of
the
lips
not
even
carleton
would
be
allowed
to
incite
to
murder
or
arson
i
would
have
him
prosecuted
for
inciting
a
nation
to
war
why
is
the
press
always
so
eager
for
war
mused
joan
according
to
their
own
account
war
does
pay
them
i
do
suppose
it
does
not
directly
answered
denton
but
it
helps
them
to
establish
their
position
and
get
a
tighter
hold
upon
the
public
war
does
pay
the
newspaper
in
the
long
run
the
daily
newspaper
lives
on
commotion
crime
lawlessness
in
general
if
people
no
longer
enjoyed
reading
about
violence
and
bloodshed
half
their
occupation
and
that
the
most
profitable
half
would
be
gone
it
is
the
interest
of
the
newspaper
to
keep
alive
the
savage
in
human
nature
and
war
affords
the
readiest
means
of
doing
this
you
ca
do
much
to
increase
the
number
of
gruesome
murders
and
loathsome
assaults
beyond
giving
all
possible
advertisement
to
them
when
they
do
occur
but
you
can
preach
war
and
cover
yourself
with
glory
as
a
patriot
at
the
same
time
i
wonder
how
many
of
my
ideals
will
be
left
to
me
sighed
joan
i
always
used
to
regard
the
press
as
the
modern
pulpit
the
old
pulpit
became
an
evil
the
moment
it
obtained
unlimited
power
answered
denton
it
originated
persecution
and
inflamed
passions
against
one
another
it
too
preached
war
for
its
own
ends
taught
superstition
and
punished
thought
as
a
crime
the
press
of
day
is
stepping
into
the
shoes
of
the
medieval
priest
it
aims
at
establishing
the
worst
kind
of
tyranny
the
tyranny
over
men
minds
they
pretend
to
fight
among
themselves
but
it
rapidly
becoming
a
close
corporation
the
institute
of
journalists
will
soon
be
followed
by
the
union
of
newspaper
proprietors
and
the
few
independent
journals
will
be
squeezed
out
already
we
have
german
shareholders
on
english
papers
and
english
capital
is
interested
in
the
petersburg
press
it
will
one
day
have
its
international
pope
and
its
school
of
cosmopolitan
cardinals
joan
laughed
i
can
see
carleton
rather
fancying
himself
in
a
tiara
she
said
i
must
tell
phillips
what
you
say
he
out
for
a
fight
with
him
government
by
parliament
or
government
by
press
is
going
to
be
his
war
cry
good
man
said
denton
i
quite
serious
you
tell
him
from
me
that
the
next
revolution
has
got
to
be
against
the
press
and
it
will
be
the
stiffest
fight
democracy
has
ever
had
the
old
lady
had
tired
herself
joan
undertook
the
mission
she
thought
she
would
rather
enjoy
it
and
denton
promised
to
let
her
have
full
instructions
she
would
write
to
her
friends
in
paris
and
prepare
them
for
joan
coming
joan
remembered
folk
the
artist
she
had
met
at
flossie
party
who
had
promised
to
walk
with
her
on
the
terrace
at
germain
and
tell
her
more
about
her
mother
she
looked
up
his
address
on
her
return
home
and
wrote
to
him
giving
him
the
name
of
the
hotel
in
the
rue
de
grenelle
where
denton
had
arranged
that
she
should
stay
she
found
a
note
from
him
awaiting
her
when
she
arrived
there
he
thought
she
would
like
to
be
quiet
after
her
journey
he
would
call
round
in
the
morning
he
had
presumed
on
the
privilege
of
age
to
send
her
some
lilies
they
had
been
her
mother
favourite
flower
monsieur
folk
the
great
artist
had
brought
them
himself
and
placed
them
in
her
so
madame
informed
her
it
was
one
of
the
old
hotels
still
left
in
paris
and
was
built
round
a
garden
famous
for
its
mighty
mulberry
tree
she
breakfasted
underneath
it
and
was
reading
there
when
folk
appeared
before
her
smiling
and
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
he
excused
himself
for
intruding
upon
her
so
soon
thinking
from
what
she
had
written
him
that
her
first
morning
might
be
his
only
chance
he
evidently
considered
her
remembrance
of
him
a
feather
in
his
cap
we
old
fellows
feel
a
little
sadly
at
times
how
unimportant
we
are
he
explained
we
are
grateful
when
youth
throws
us
a
smile
you
told
me
my
coming
would
take
you
back
years
joan
reminded
him
it
makes
us
about
the
same
age
i
shall
treat
you
as
just
a
young
man
he
laughed
do
be
surprised
he
said
if
i
make
a
mistake
occasionally
and
call
you
lena
joan
had
no
appointment
till
the
afternoon
they
drove
out
to
germain
and
had
at
a
small
restaurant
opposite
the
chateau
and
afterwards
they
strolled
on
to
the
terrace
what
was
my
mother
doing
in
paris
asked
joan
she
was
studying
for
the
stage
he
answered
paris
was
the
only
school
in
those
days
i
was
at
julien
studio
we
acted
together
for
some
charity
i
had
always
been
fond
of
it
an
american
manager
who
was
present
offered
us
both
an
engagement
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
change
and
that
i
could
combine
the
two
arts
and
it
was
here
that
you
proposed
to
her
said
joan
just
by
that
tree
that
leans
forward
he
answered
pointing
with
his
cane
a
little
way
ahead
i
thought
that
in
america
i
get
another
chance
i
might
have
if
your
father
had
come
along
i
wonder
if
he
remembers
me
did
you
ever
see
her
again
after
her
marriage
asked
joan
no
he
answered
we
used
to
write
to
one
another
until
she
gave
it
up
she
had
got
into
the
habit
of
looking
upon
me
as
a
harmless
sort
of
thing
to
confide
in
and
ask
advice
of
which
she
never
took
forgive
me
he
said
you
must
remember
that
i
am
still
her
lover
they
had
reached
the
tree
that
leant
a
little
forward
beyond
its
fellows
and
he
had
halted
and
turned
so
that
he
was
facing
her
did
she
and
your
father
get
on
together
was
she
happy
i
do
think
she
was
happy
answered
joan
she
was
at
first
as
a
child
i
can
remember
her
singing
and
laughing
about
the
house
and
she
liked
always
to
have
people
about
her
until
her
illness
came
it
changed
her
very
much
but
my
father
was
gentleness
itself
to
the
end
they
had
resumed
their
stroll
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
looked
at
her
once
or
twice
a
little
oddly
without
speaking
what
caused
your
mother
illness
he
asked
abruptly
the
question
troubled
her
it
struck
her
with
a
pang
of
that
she
had
always
been
indifferent
to
her
mother
illness
regarding
it
as
more
or
less
imaginary
it
was
mental
rather
than
physical
i
think
she
answered
i
never
knew
what
brought
it
about
again
he
looked
at
her
with
that
odd
inquisitive
expression
she
never
got
over
it
he
asked
oh
there
were
times
answered
joan
when
she
was
more
like
her
old
self
again
but
i
do
think
she
ever
quite
got
over
it
unless
it
was
towards
the
end
she
added
they
told
me
she
seemed
much
better
for
a
little
while
before
she
died
i
was
away
at
cambridge
at
the
time
poor
dear
lady
he
said
all
those
years
and
poor
jack
allway
he
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
suddenly
he
turned
to
her
how
is
the
dear
fellow
he
asked
again
the
question
troubled
her
she
had
not
seen
her
father
since
that
nearly
six
months
ago
when
she
had
ran
down
to
see
him
because
she
wanted
something
from
him
he
felt
my
mother
death
very
deeply
she
answered
but
he
well
enough
in
health
remember
me
to
him
he
said
and
tell
him
i
thank
him
for
all
those
years
of
love
and
gentleness
i
do
think
he
will
be
offended
he
drove
her
back
to
paris
and
she
promised
to
come
and
see
him
in
his
studio
and
let
him
introduce
her
to
his
artist
friends
i
shall
try
to
win
you
over
i
warn
you
he
said
politics
will
never
reform
the
world
they
appeal
only
to
men
passions
and
hatreds
they
divide
us
it
is
art
that
is
going
to
civilize
mankind
broaden
his
sympathies
art
speaks
to
him
the
common
language
of
his
loves
his
dreams
reveals
to
him
the
universal
kinship
denton
friends
called
upon
her
and
most
of
them
invited
her
to
their
houses
a
few
were
politicians
senators
or
ministers
others
were
bankers
heads
of
business
houses
literary
men
and
women
there
were
also
a
few
quiet
folk
with
names
that
were
historical
they
all
thought
that
war
between
france
and
england
would
be
a
world
disaster
but
were
not
very
hopeful
of
averting
it
she
learnt
that
carleton
was
in
berlin
trying
to
secure
possession
of
a
german
daily
that
happened
at
the
moment
to
be
in
low
water
he
was
working
for
an
alliance
between
germany
and
england
in
france
the
royalists
had
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
clericals
and
both
were
evidently
making
ready
to
throw
in
their
lot
with
the
hoping
that
out
of
the
troubled
waters
the
fish
would
come
their
way
of
course
everything
depended
on
the
people
if
the
people
only
knew
it
but
they
did
they
stood
about
in
puzzled
flocks
like
sheep
wondering
which
way
the
newspaper
dog
was
going
to
hound
them
they
took
her
to
the
great
music
halls
every
allusion
to
war
was
greeted
with
rapturous
applause
the
marseillaise
was
demanded
and
encored
till
the
orchestra
rebelled
from
sheer
exhaustion
joan
patience
was
sorely
tested
she
had
to
listen
with
impassive
face
to
coarse
jests
and
brutal
gibes
directed
against
england
and
everything
english
to
sit
unmoved
while
the
vast
audience
rocked
with
laughter
at
senseless
caricatures
of
supposed
english
soldiers
whose
knees
always
gave
way
at
the
sight
of
a
french
uniform
even
in
the
eyes
of
her
courteous
hosts
joan
quick
glance
would
occasionally
detect
a
curious
glint
the
fools
had
they
never
heard
of
waterloo
and
trafalgar
even
if
their
memories
might
be
excused
for
forgetting
crecy
and
poictiers
and
the
campaigns
of
marlborough
one
evening
it
had
been
a
particularly
trying
one
for
joan
there
stepped
upon
the
stage
a
man
in
a
kilt
with
bagpipes
under
his
arm
how
he
had
got
himself
into
the
programme
joan
could
not
understand
managerial
watchfulness
must
have
gone
to
sleep
for
once
he
played
scotch
melodies
and
the
parisians
liked
them
and
when
he
had
finished
they
called
him
back
joan
and
her
friends
occupied
a
box
close
to
the
stage
the
scot
glanced
up
at
her
and
their
eyes
met
and
as
the
applause
died
down
there
rose
the
first
low
warning
strains
of
the
pibroch
joan
sat
up
in
her
chair
and
her
lips
parted
the
savage
music
quickened
it
shrilled
and
skrealed
the
blood
came
surging
through
her
veins
and
suddenly
something
lying
hidden
there
leaped
to
life
within
her
brain
a
mad
desire
surged
hold
of
her
to
rise
and
shout
defiance
at
those
three
thousand
pairs
of
hostile
eyes
confronting
her
she
clutched
at
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
so
kept
her
seat
the
pibroch
ended
with
its
wild
sad
notes
of
wailing
and
slowly
the
mist
cleared
from
her
eyes
and
the
stage
was
empty
a
strange
hush
had
fallen
on
the
house
she
was
not
aware
that
her
hostess
had
been
watching
her
she
was
a
lady
she
touched
joan
lightly
on
the
hand
that
the
trouble
she
whispered
it
in
our
blood
could
we
ever
hope
to
eradicate
it
was
not
the
survival
of
this
fighting
instinct
proof
that
war
was
still
needful
to
us
in
the
of
an
exhibition
she
came
upon
a
painted
statue
of
bellona
its
grotesqueness
shocked
her
at
first
sight
the
red
streaming
hair
the
wild
eyes
filled
with
fury
the
wide
open
mouth
one
could
almost
hear
it
screaming
the
white
uplifted
arms
with
outstretched
hands
appalling
terrible
and
yet
as
she
gazed
at
it
gradually
the
thing
grew
curiously
real
to
her
she
seemed
to
hear
the
gathering
of
the
chariots
the
neighing
of
the
horses
the
hurrying
of
many
feet
the
sound
of
an
armouring
multitude
the
shouting
and
the
braying
of
the
trumpets
these
cold
calculators
arguing
that
war
does
pay
those
cosmopolitans
preaching
their
international
as
if
the
only
business
of
mankind
were
wages
war
still
was
the
stern
school
where
men
learnt
virtue
duty
forgetfulness
of
self
faithfulness
unto
death
this
particular
war
of
course
must
be
stopped
if
it
were
not
already
too
late
it
would
be
a
war
for
markets
for
spheres
of
commercial
influence
a
sordid
war
that
would
degrade
the
people
war
the
supreme
test
of
a
nation
worth
must
be
reserved
for
great
ideals
besides
she
wanted
to
down
carleton
one
of
the
women
on
her
list
and
the
one
to
whom
denton
appeared
to
attach
chief
importance
a
madame
de
barante
disappointed
joan
she
seemed
to
have
so
few
opinions
of
her
own
she
had
buried
her
young
husband
during
the
war
he
had
been
a
soldier
and
she
had
remained
unmarried
she
was
still
beautiful
i
do
not
think
we
women
have
the
right
to
discuss
war
she
confided
to
joan
in
her
gentle
voice
i
suppose
you
think
that
out
of
date
i
should
have
thought
so
myself
forty
years
ago
we
talk
of
our
sons
and
lovers
as
if
they
were
ours
to
give
it
makes
me
a
little
angry
when
i
hear
pampered
women
speak
like
that
it
is
the
men
who
have
to
suffer
and
die
it
is
for
them
to
decide
but
perhaps
i
can
arrange
a
meeting
for
you
with
a
friend
she
added
who
will
be
better
able
to
help
you
if
he
is
in
paris
i
will
let
you
know
she
told
joan
what
she
remembered
herself
of
she
had
turned
her
country
house
into
a
hospital
and
had
seen
a
good
deal
of
the
fighting
it
would
not
do
to
tell
the
truth
or
we
should
have
our
children
growing
up
to
hate
war
she
concluded
she
was
as
good
as
her
word
and
sent
joan
round
a
message
the
next
morning
to
come
and
see
her
in
the
afternoon
joan
was
introduced
to
a
monsieur
de
chaumont
he
was
a
gentleman
with
a
grey
moustache
and
a
deep
scar
across
his
face
hanged
if
i
can
see
how
we
are
going
to
get
out
of
it
he
answered
joan
cheerfully
the
moment
there
is
any
threat
of
war
it
becomes
a
point
of
honour
with
every
nation
to
do
nothing
to
avoid
it
i
remember
my
old
duelling
days
the
quarrel
may
have
been
about
the
silliest
trifle
imaginable
a
single
word
would
have
explained
the
whole
thing
away
but
to
utter
it
would
have
stamped
one
as
a
coward
this
egyptian
it
is
worth
the
bones
of
a
single
grenadier
as
our
friends
across
the
rhine
would
say
but
i
expect
before
it
settled
there
will
be
bones
sufficient
bleaching
on
the
desert
to
build
another
pyramid
so
easily
started
that
the
devil
of
it
a
mischievous
boy
can
throw
a
lighted
match
into
a
powder
magazine
and
then
it
becomes
every
business
to
see
that
it
is
put
out
i
hate
war
it
accomplishes
nothing
and
leaves
everything
in
a
greater
muddle
than
it
was
before
but
if
the
idea
ever
catches
fire
i
shall
have
to
do
all
i
can
to
fan
the
conflagration
unless
i
am
prepared
to
be
branded
as
a
poltroon
every
professional
soldier
is
supposed
to
welcome
war
most
of
us
do
it
our
opportunity
there
some
excuse
for
us
but
these
men
carleton
and
their
lot
i
regard
them
as
nothing
better
than
the
menades
of
the
commune
they
care
nothing
if
the
whole
of
europe
blazes
they
can
not
personally
get
harmed
whatever
happens
it
fun
to
them
but
the
people
who
can
get
harmed
argued
joan
the
men
who
will
be
dragged
away
from
their
work
from
their
business
used
as
fodder
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
they
are
always
eager
enough
for
it
at
first
he
answered
there
is
the
excitement
the
curiosity
you
must
remember
that
life
is
a
monotonous
affair
to
the
great
mass
of
the
people
there
the
natural
craving
to
escape
from
it
to
court
adventure
they
are
not
so
enthusiastic
about
it
after
they
have
tasted
it
modern
warfare
they
soon
find
is
about
as
dull
a
business
as
science
ever
invented
there
was
only
one
hope
that
he
could
see
and
that
was
to
switch
the
people
mind
on
to
some
other
excitement
his
advices
from
london
told
him
that
a
parliamentary
crisis
was
pending
could
not
denton
and
her
party
do
something
to
hasten
it
he
on
his
side
would
consult
with
the
socialist
leaders
who
might
have
something
to
suggest
he
met
joan
radiant
a
morning
or
two
later
the
english
government
had
resigned
and
preparations
for
a
general
election
were
already
on
foot
and
god
has
been
good
to
us
also
he
explained
a
artist
had
been
found
murdered
in
his
bed
and
grave
suspicion
attached
to
his
beautiful
young
wife
she
deserves
the
croix
de
guerre
if
it
is
proved
that
she
did
it
he
thought
she
will
have
saved
many
thousands
of
lives
for
the
present
folk
had
fixed
up
a
party
at
his
studio
to
meet
her
she
had
been
there
once
or
twice
but
this
was
a
final
affair
she
had
finished
her
business
in
paris
and
would
be
leaving
the
next
morning
to
her
surprise
she
found
phillips
there
he
had
come
over
hurriedly
to
attend
a
socialist
conference
and
leblanc
the
editor
of
nouveau
had
brought
him
along
i
took
smedley
place
at
the
last
moment
he
whispered
to
her
never
been
abroad
before
you
do
mind
do
you
it
did
strike
her
as
at
all
odd
that
a
leader
of
a
political
party
should
ask
her
if
she
minded
his
being
in
paris
to
attend
a
political
conference
he
was
wearing
a
light
grey
suit
and
a
blue
tie
there
was
nothing
about
him
at
that
moment
suggesting
that
he
was
a
leader
of
any
sort
he
might
have
been
just
any
man
but
for
his
eyes
no
she
whispered
of
course
not
i
do
like
your
tie
it
seemed
to
depress
him
that
she
felt
elated
at
the
thought
that
he
would
see
her
for
the
first
time
amid
surroundings
where
she
would
shine
folk
came
forward
to
meet
her
with
that
charming
air
of
protective
deference
that
he
had
adopted
towards
her
he
might
have
been
some
favoured
minister
of
state
kissing
the
hand
of
a
youthful
queen
she
glanced
down
the
long
studio
ending
in
its
fine
window
overlooking
the
park
some
of
the
most
distinguished
men
in
paris
were
there
and
the
immediate
stir
of
admiration
that
her
entrance
had
created
was
unmistakable
even
the
women
turned
pleased
glances
at
her
as
if
willing
to
recognize
in
her
their
representative
a
sense
of
power
came
to
her
that
made
her
feel
kind
to
all
the
world
there
was
no
need
for
her
to
be
clever
to
make
any
effort
to
attract
her
presence
her
sympathy
her
approval
seemed
to
be
all
that
was
needed
of
her
she
had
the
consciousness
that
by
the
mere
exercise
of
her
will
she
could
sway
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
these
men
that
sovereignty
had
been
given
to
her
it
reflected
itself
in
her
slightly
heightened
colour
in
the
increased
brilliance
of
her
eyes
in
the
confident
case
of
all
her
movements
it
added
a
compelling
softness
to
her
voice
she
never
quite
remembered
what
the
talk
was
about
men
were
brought
up
and
presented
to
her
and
hung
about
her
words
and
sought
to
please
her
she
had
spoken
her
own
thoughts
indifferent
whether
they
expressed
agreement
or
not
and
the
argument
had
invariably
taken
another
plane
it
seemed
so
important
that
she
should
be
convinced
some
had
succeeded
and
had
been
strengthened
others
had
failed
and
had
departed
sorrowful
conscious
of
the
necessity
of
thinking
it
out
again
guests
with
other
engagements
were
taking
their
leave
a
piquante
little
woman
outrageously
but
effectively
dressed
she
looked
like
a
drawing
by
beardsley
drew
her
aside
i
always
wished
i
were
a
man
she
said
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
had
all
the
power
from
this
afternoon
i
shall
be
proud
of
belonging
to
the
governing
sex
she
laughed
and
slipped
away
phillips
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
vestibule
she
had
forgotten
him
but
now
she
felt
glad
of
his
humble
request
to
be
allowed
to
see
her
home
it
would
have
been
such
a
big
drop
from
her
crowded
hour
of
triumph
to
the
long
lonely
cab
ride
and
the
solitude
of
the
hotel
she
resolved
to
be
gracious
feeling
a
little
sorry
for
her
neglect
of
him
but
reflecting
with
satisfaction
that
he
had
probably
been
watching
her
the
whole
time
what
the
matter
with
my
tie
he
asked
wrong
colour
she
laughed
yes
she
answered
it
ought
to
be
grey
to
match
your
suit
and
so
ought
your
socks
i
did
know
it
was
going
to
be
such
a
swell
affair
or
i
have
come
he
said
she
touched
his
hand
lightly
i
want
you
to
get
used
to
it
she
said
it
part
of
your
work
put
your
brain
into
it
and
do
be
afraid
i
try
he
said
he
was
sitting
on
the
front
seat
facing
her
i
glad
i
went
he
said
with
sudden
vehemence
i
loved
watching
you
moving
about
among
all
those
people
i
never
knew
before
how
beautiful
you
are
something
in
his
eyes
sent
a
slight
thrill
of
fear
through
her
it
was
not
an
unpleasant
sensation
rather
exhilarating
she
watched
the
passing
street
till
she
felt
that
his
eyes
were
no
longer
devouring
her
you
not
offended
he
asked
at
my
thinking
you
beautiful
he
added
in
case
she
had
understood
she
laughed
her
confidence
had
returned
to
her
it
does
generally
offend
a
woman
she
answered
he
seemed
relieved
that
what
so
wonderful
about
you
he
said
i
met
plenty
of
clever
brilliant
women
but
one
could
forget
that
they
were
women
you
everything
he
pleaded
standing
below
her
on
the
steps
of
the
hotel
that
she
would
dine
with
him
but
she
shook
her
head
she
had
her
packing
to
do
she
could
have
managed
it
but
something
prudent
and
absurd
had
suddenly
got
hold
of
her
and
he
went
away
with
much
the
same
look
in
his
eyes
that
comes
to
a
dog
when
he
finds
that
his
master
can
not
be
persuaded
into
an
excursion
she
went
up
to
her
room
there
really
was
not
much
to
do
she
could
quite
well
finish
her
packing
in
the
morning
she
sat
down
at
the
desk
and
set
to
work
to
arrange
her
papers
it
was
a
warm
spring
evening
and
the
window
was
open
a
crowd
of
noisy
sparrows
seemed
to
be
delighted
about
something
from
somewhere
unseen
a
blackbird
was
singing
she
read
over
her
report
for
denton
the
blackbird
seemed
never
to
have
heard
of
war
he
sang
as
if
the
whole
world
were
a
garden
of
languor
and
love
joan
looked
at
her
watch
the
first
gong
would
sound
in
a
few
minutes
she
pictured
the
dreary
silent
with
its
few
scattered
occupants
and
her
heart
sank
at
the
prospect
to
her
relief
came
remembrance
of
a
cheerful
but
entirely
respectable
restaurant
near
to
the
louvre
to
which
she
had
been
taken
a
few
nights
before
she
had
noticed
quite
a
number
of
women
dining
there
alone
she
closed
her
dispatch
case
with
a
snap
and
gave
a
glance
at
herself
in
the
great
mirror
the
blackbird
was
still
singing
she
walked
up
the
rue
des
sts
peres
enjoying
the
delicious
air
half
way
across
the
bridge
she
overtook
a
man
strolling
listlessly
in
front
of
her
there
was
something
familiar
about
him
he
was
wearing
a
grey
suit
and
had
his
hands
in
his
pockets
suddenly
the
truth
flashed
upon
her
she
stopped
if
he
strolled
on
she
would
be
able
to
slip
back
instead
of
which
he
abruptly
turned
to
look
down
at
a
passing
steamer
and
they
were
face
to
face
it
made
her
mad
the
look
of
delight
that
came
into
his
eyes
she
could
have
boxed
his
ears
had
he
anything
else
to
do
but
hang
about
the
streets
he
explained
that
he
had
been
listening
to
the
band
in
the
gardens
returning
by
the
quai
do
let
me
come
with
you
he
said
i
kept
myself
free
this
evening
hoping
and
i
feeling
so
lonesome
poor
fellow
she
had
come
to
understand
that
feeling
after
all
it
was
altogether
his
fault
that
they
had
met
and
she
had
been
so
cross
to
him
he
was
reading
every
expression
on
her
face
it
such
a
lovely
evening
he
said
could
we
go
somewhere
and
dine
under
a
tree
it
would
be
rather
pleasant
there
was
a
little
place
at
meudon
she
remembered
the
plane
trees
would
just
be
in
full
leaf
a
passing
cab
had
drawn
up
close
to
them
the
chauffeur
was
lighting
his
pipe
even
grundy
herself
could
object
to
a
journalist
dining
with
a
politician
the
stars
came
out
before
they
had
ended
dinner
she
had
made
him
talk
about
himself
it
was
marvellous
what
he
had
accomplished
with
his
opportunities
ten
hours
a
day
in
the
mines
had
earned
for
him
his
living
and
the
night
had
given
him
his
leisure
an
attic
lighted
by
a
tallow
candle
with
a
shelf
of
books
that
left
him
hardly
enough
for
bread
had
been
his
alma
mater
history
was
his
chief
study
there
was
hardly
an
authority
joan
could
think
of
with
which
he
was
not
familiar
was
his
favourite
play
he
seemed
to
know
it
by
heart
at
he
had
been
elected
a
delegate
and
had
entered
parliament
at
it
had
been
a
life
of
hardship
of
privation
of
constant
strain
but
she
found
herself
unable
to
pity
him
it
was
a
tale
of
strength
of
struggle
of
victory
that
he
told
her
strength
the
shaded
lamplight
fell
upon
his
fearless
kindly
face
with
its
flashing
eyes
and
its
humorous
mouth
he
ought
to
have
been
drinking
out
of
a
horn
not
a
wine
glass
that
his
hand
could
have
crushed
by
a
careless
pressure
in
a
winged
helmet
and
a
coat
of
mail
he
would
have
looked
so
much
more
fitly
dressed
than
in
that
soft
felt
hat
and
ridiculous
blue
tie
she
led
him
to
talk
on
about
the
future
she
loved
to
hear
his
clear
confident
voice
with
its
touch
of
boyish
boastfulness
what
was
there
to
stop
him
why
should
he
not
climb
from
power
to
power
till
he
had
reached
the
end
and
as
he
talked
and
dreamed
there
grew
up
in
her
heart
a
fierce
anger
what
would
her
own
future
be
she
would
marry
probably
some
man
of
her
own
class
settle
down
to
the
average
woman
life
be
allowed
like
a
spoilt
child
to
still
take
an
interest
in
public
affairs
hold
attended
by
cranks
and
political
nonentities
be
president
perhaps
of
the
local
woman
liberal
league
the
alternative
to
spend
her
days
glued
to
a
desk
penning
exhortations
to
the
people
that
carleton
and
his
like
might
or
might
not
allow
them
to
read
while
youth
and
beauty
slipped
away
from
her
leaving
her
one
of
the
ten
thousand
other
lonely
faded
women
forcing
themselves
unwelcome
into
men
jobs
there
came
to
her
a
sense
of
having
been
robbed
of
what
was
hers
by
primitive
eternal
law
greyson
had
been
right
she
did
love
power
power
to
serve
and
shape
the
world
she
would
have
earned
it
and
used
it
well
she
could
have
helped
him
inspired
him
they
would
have
worked
together
he
the
force
and
she
the
guidance
she
would
have
supplied
the
things
he
lacked
it
was
to
her
he
came
for
counsel
as
it
was
but
for
her
he
would
never
have
taken
the
first
step
what
right
had
this
poor
brainless
lump
of
painted
flesh
to
share
his
wounds
his
triumphs
what
help
could
she
give
him
when
the
time
should
come
that
he
should
need
it
suddenly
he
broke
off
what
a
fool
i
making
of
myself
he
said
i
always
was
a
dreamer
she
forced
a
laugh
why
should
it
come
true
she
asked
they
had
the
little
garden
to
themselves
the
million
lights
of
paris
shone
below
them
because
you
wo
be
there
he
answered
and
without
you
i
ca
do
it
you
think
i
always
like
i
am
bragging
confident
so
i
am
when
you
are
with
me
you
give
me
back
my
strength
the
plans
and
hopes
and
dreams
that
were
slipping
from
me
come
crowding
round
me
laughing
and
holding
out
their
hands
they
are
like
the
children
they
need
two
to
care
for
them
i
want
to
talk
about
them
to
someone
who
understands
them
and
loves
them
as
i
do
i
want
to
feel
they
are
dear
to
someone
else
as
well
as
to
myself
that
i
must
work
for
them
for
her
sake
as
well
as
for
my
own
i
want
someone
to
help
me
to
bring
them
up
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
he
brushed
them
angrily
away
oh
i
know
i
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
myself
he
said
it
was
her
fault
she
was
to
know
that
a
young
chap
of
twenty
has
all
his
wits
about
him
any
more
than
i
was
if
i
had
never
met
you
it
have
mattered
i
have
done
my
bit
of
good
and
have
stopped
there
content
with
you
beside
me
he
looked
away
from
her
to
where
the
silent
city
peeped
through
its
veil
of
night
i
might
have
left
the
world
better
than
i
found
it
the
blood
had
mounted
to
her
face
she
drew
back
into
the
shadow
beyond
the
tiny
sphere
of
light
made
by
the
little
lamp
men
have
accomplished
great
things
without
a
woman
help
she
said
some
men
he
answered
artists
and
poets
they
have
the
woman
within
them
men
like
myself
the
mere
fighter
we
are
incomplete
in
ourselves
male
and
female
created
he
them
we
are
lost
without
our
mate
he
was
thinking
only
of
himself
had
he
no
pity
for
her
so
was
she
also
useless
without
her
mate
neither
was
she
of
those
here
and
there
who
can
stand
alone
her
task
was
that
of
the
eternal
woman
to
make
a
home
to
cleanse
the
world
of
sin
and
sorrow
make
it
a
kinder
for
the
children
that
should
come
this
man
was
her
true
helpmeet
he
would
have
been
her
weapon
her
dear
servant
and
she
could
have
rewarded
him
as
none
other
ever
could
the
lamplight
fell
upon
his
ruddy
face
his
strong
white
hands
resting
on
the
flimsy
table
he
belonged
to
an
older
order
than
her
own
that
suggestion
about
him
of
something
primitive
of
something
not
yet
altogether
tamed
she
felt
again
that
slight
thrill
of
fear
that
so
strangely
excited
her
a
mist
seemed
to
be
obscuring
all
things
he
seemed
to
be
coming
towards
her
only
by
keeping
her
eyes
fixed
on
his
moveless
hands
still
resting
on
the
table
could
she
convince
herself
that
his
arms
were
not
closing
about
her
that
she
was
not
being
drawn
nearer
and
nearer
to
him
powerless
to
resist
suddenly
out
of
the
mist
she
heard
voices
the
waiter
was
standing
beside
him
with
the
bill
she
reached
out
her
hand
and
took
it
the
usual
few
mistakes
had
occurred
she
explained
them
good
temperedly
and
the
waiter
with
profuse
apologies
went
back
to
have
it
corrected
he
turned
to
her
as
the
man
went
try
and
forgive
me
he
said
in
a
low
voice
it
all
came
tumbling
out
before
i
thought
what
i
was
saying
the
blood
was
flowing
back
into
her
veins
oh
it
was
your
fault
she
answered
we
must
make
the
best
we
can
of
it
he
bent
forward
so
that
he
could
see
into
her
eyes
tell
me
he
said
there
was
a
note
of
fierce
exultation
in
his
voice
i
promise
never
to
speak
of
it
again
if
i
had
been
a
free
man
could
i
have
won
you
she
had
risen
while
he
was
speaking
she
moved
to
him
and
laid
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
will
you
serve
me
and
fight
for
me
against
all
my
enemies
she
asked
so
long
as
i
live
he
answered
she
glanced
round
there
was
no
sign
of
the
returning
waiter
she
bent
over
him
and
kissed
him
do
come
with
me
she
said
there
a
cab
stand
in
the
avenue
i
shall
walk
to
sevres
and
take
the
train
she
did
not
look
back
chapter
xii
she
reached
home
in
the
evening
the
phillips
old
rooms
had
been
twice
let
since
christmas
but
were
now
again
empty
the
mckean
with
his
silent
ways
and
his
everlasting
pipe
had
gone
to
america
to
superintend
the
production
of
one
of
his
plays
the
house
gave
her
the
feeling
of
being
haunted
she
had
her
dinner
brought
up
to
her
and
prepared
for
a
long
evening
work
but
found
herself
unable
to
think
except
on
the
one
subject
that
she
wanted
to
put
off
thinking
about
to
her
relief
the
last
post
brought
her
a
letter
from
arthur
he
had
been
called
to
lisbon
to
look
after
a
contract
and
would
be
away
for
a
fortnight
her
father
was
not
as
well
as
he
had
been
it
seemed
to
just
fit
in
she
would
run
down
and
spend
a
few
quiet
days
at
liverpool
in
her
old
familiar
room
where
the
moon
peeped
in
over
the
tops
of
the
tall
pines
she
would
be
able
to
reason
things
out
perhaps
her
father
would
be
able
to
help
her
she
had
lost
her
childish
conception
of
him
as
of
someone
prim
and
proper
with
cut
and
dried
formulas
for
all
occasions
that
glimpse
he
had
shown
her
of
himself
had
established
a
fellowship
between
them
he
too
had
wrestled
with
riddles
not
sure
of
his
own
answers
she
found
him
suffering
from
his
old
heart
trouble
but
more
cheerful
than
she
had
known
him
for
years
arthur
seemed
to
be
doing
wonders
with
the
men
they
were
coming
to
trust
him
the
difficulty
i
have
always
been
up
against
explained
her
father
has
been
their
suspicion
the
cunning
old
rascal
up
to
now
what
his
little
game
that
is
always
what
i
have
felt
they
were
thinking
to
themselves
whenever
i
have
wanted
to
do
anything
for
them
it
is
anything
he
says
to
them
it
seems
to
be
just
he
himself
he
sketched
out
their
plans
to
her
it
seemed
to
be
all
going
in
at
one
ear
and
out
at
the
other
what
was
the
matter
with
her
perhaps
she
was
tired
without
knowing
it
she
would
get
him
to
tell
her
all
about
it
morrow
also
she
would
tell
him
about
phillips
and
ask
his
advice
it
was
really
quite
late
if
he
talked
any
more
now
it
would
give
her
a
headache
she
felt
it
coming
on
she
made
her
extra
affectionate
hoping
to
disguise
her
impatience
she
wanted
to
get
up
to
her
own
room
but
even
that
did
not
help
her
it
seemed
in
some
mysterious
way
to
be
no
longer
her
room
but
the
room
of
someone
she
had
known
and
half
forgotten
who
would
never
come
back
it
gave
her
the
same
feeling
she
had
experienced
on
returning
to
the
house
in
london
that
the
place
was
haunted
the
high
cheval
glass
from
her
mother
had
been
brought
there
for
her
use
the
picture
of
an
absurdly
small
child
the
child
to
whom
this
room
had
once
belonged
standing
before
it
naked
rose
before
her
eyes
she
had
wanted
to
see
herself
she
had
thought
that
only
her
clothes
stood
in
the
way
if
we
could
but
see
ourselves
as
in
some
magic
mirror
all
the
garments
usage
and
education
has
dressed
us
up
in
laid
aside
what
was
she
underneath
her
artificial
niceties
her
prim
moralities
her
laboriously
acquired
restraints
her
unconscious
pretences
and
hypocrisies
she
changed
her
clothes
for
a
loose
robe
and
putting
out
the
light
drew
back
the
curtains
the
moon
peeped
in
over
the
top
of
the
tall
pines
but
it
only
stared
at
her
indifferent
it
seemed
to
be
looking
for
somebody
else
suddenly
and
intensely
to
her
own
surprise
she
fell
into
a
passionate
fit
of
weeping
there
was
no
reason
for
it
and
it
was
altogether
so
unlike
her
but
for
quite
a
while
she
was
unable
to
control
it
gradually
and
of
their
own
accord
her
sobs
lessened
and
she
was
able
to
wipe
her
eyes
and
take
stock
of
herself
in
the
long
glass
she
wondered
for
the
moment
whether
it
was
really
her
own
reflection
that
she
saw
there
or
that
of
some
ghostly
image
of
her
mother
she
had
so
often
seen
the
same
look
in
her
mother
eyes
evidently
the
likeness
between
them
was
more
extensive
than
she
had
imagined
for
the
first
time
she
became
conscious
of
an
emotional
hysterical
side
to
her
nature
of
which
she
had
been
unaware
perhaps
it
was
just
as
well
that
she
had
discovered
it
she
would
have
to
keep
a
stricter
watch
upon
herself
this
question
of
her
future
relationship
with
phillips
it
would
have
to
be
thought
out
coldly
dispassionately
nothing
unexpected
must
be
allowed
to
enter
into
it
it
was
some
time
before
she
fell
asleep
the
high
glass
faced
her
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
could
not
get
away
from
the
idea
that
it
was
her
mother
face
that
every
now
and
then
she
saw
reflected
there
she
woke
late
the
next
morning
her
father
had
already
left
for
the
works
she
was
rather
glad
to
have
no
need
of
talking
she
would
take
a
long
walk
into
the
country
and
face
the
thing
squarely
with
the
help
of
the
cheerful
sun
and
the
free
west
wind
that
was
blowing
from
the
sea
she
took
the
train
up
north
and
struck
across
the
hills
her
spirits
rose
as
she
walked
it
was
only
the
intellectual
part
of
him
she
wanted
the
spirit
not
the
man
she
would
be
taking
nothing
away
from
the
woman
nothing
that
had
ever
belonged
to
her
all
the
rest
of
him
his
home
life
the
benefits
that
would
come
to
her
from
his
improved
means
from
his
social
position
all
that
the
woman
had
ever
known
or
cared
for
in
him
would
still
be
hers
he
would
still
remain
to
her
the
kind
husband
and
father
what
more
was
the
woman
capable
of
understanding
what
more
had
she
any
right
to
demand
it
was
not
of
herself
she
was
thinking
it
was
for
his
work
sake
that
she
wanted
to
be
near
to
him
always
that
she
might
counsel
him
encourage
him
for
this
she
was
prepared
to
sacrifice
herself
give
up
her
woman
claim
on
life
they
would
be
friends
comrades
nothing
more
that
little
lurking
curiosity
of
hers
concerning
what
it
would
be
like
to
feel
his
strong
arms
round
her
pressing
her
closer
and
closer
to
him
it
was
only
a
foolish
fancy
she
could
easily
laugh
that
out
of
herself
only
bad
women
had
need
to
be
afraid
of
themselves
she
would
keep
guard
for
both
of
them
their
purity
of
motive
their
high
purpose
would
save
them
from
the
danger
of
anything
vulgar
or
ridiculous
of
course
they
would
have
to
be
careful
there
must
be
no
breath
of
gossip
no
food
for
evil
tongues
about
that
she
was
determined
even
more
for
his
sake
than
her
own
it
would
be
fatal
to
his
career
she
was
quite
in
agreement
with
the
popular
demand
supposed
to
be
peculiarly
english
that
a
public
man
life
should
be
above
reproach
of
what
use
these
prophets
without
these
social
reformers
who
could
not
shake
the
ape
out
of
themselves
only
the
brave
could
give
courage
to
others
only
through
the
pure
could
god
light
shine
upon
men
it
was
vexing
his
having
moved
round
the
corner
into
north
street
why
could
the
silly
woman
have
been
content
where
she
was
living
under
one
roof
they
could
have
seen
one
another
as
often
as
was
needful
without
attracting
attention
now
she
supposed
she
would
have
to
be
more
than
ever
the
bosom
friend
of
phillips
spend
hours
amid
that
hideous
furniture
surrounded
by
those
bilious
wallpapers
of
course
he
could
not
come
to
her
she
hoped
he
would
appreciate
the
sacrifice
she
would
be
making
for
him
fortunately
phillips
would
give
no
trouble
she
would
not
even
understand
what
about
hilda
no
hope
of
hiding
their
secret
from
those
sharp
eyes
but
hilda
would
approve
they
could
trust
hilda
the
child
might
prove
helpful
it
cast
a
passing
shadow
upon
her
spirits
this
necessary
descent
into
details
it
brought
with
it
the
suggestion
of
intrigue
of
deceit
robbing
the
thing
to
a
certain
extent
of
its
fineness
still
what
was
to
be
done
if
women
were
coming
into
public
life
these
sort
of
relationships
with
men
would
have
to
be
faced
and
worked
out
sex
must
no
longer
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
working
together
of
men
and
women
for
common
ends
it
was
that
had
kept
the
world
back
they
would
be
the
pioneers
of
the
new
order
casting
aside
their
earthly
passions
humbly
with
pure
hearts
they
would
kneel
before
god
altar
he
should
bless
their
union
a
lark
was
singing
she
stood
listening
higher
and
higher
he
rose
pouring
out
his
song
of
worship
till
the
tiny
fragile
body
disappeared
as
if
fallen
from
him
leaving
his
sweet
soul
still
singing
the
happy
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
she
passed
on
she
did
not
hear
that
little
last
faint
sob
with
which
he
sank
exhausted
back
to
earth
beside
a
hidden
nest
among
the
furrows
she
had
forgotten
the
time
it
was
already
late
afternoon
her
long
walk
and
the
keen
air
had
made
her
hungry
she
had
a
couple
of
eggs
with
her
tea
at
a
village
inn
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
catch
a
train
that
brought
her
back
in
time
for
dinner
a
little
ashamed
of
her
unresponsiveness
the
night
before
she
laid
herself
out
to
be
sympathetic
to
her
father
talk
she
insisted
on
hearing
again
all
that
he
and
arthur
were
doing
opposing
him
here
and
there
with
criticism
just
sufficient
to
stimulate
him
careful
in
the
end
to
let
him
convince
her
these
small
hypocrisies
were
new
to
her
she
hoped
she
was
not
damaging
her
character
but
it
was
good
watching
him
slyly
from
under
lids
to
see
the
flash
of
triumph
that
would
come
into
his
tired
eyes
in
answer
to
her
yes
i
see
your
point
i
had
thought
of
that
her
half
reluctant
admission
that
perhaps
he
was
right
there
that
perhaps
she
was
wrong
it
was
delightful
to
see
him
young
again
eager
boyishly
pleased
with
himself
it
seemed
there
was
a
joy
she
had
not
dreamed
of
in
yielding
victory
as
well
as
in
gaining
it
a
new
tenderness
was
growing
up
in
her
how
considerate
how
patient
how
he
had
always
been
she
wanted
to
mother
him
to
take
him
in
her
arms
and
croon
over
him
hushing
away
remembrance
of
the
old
sad
days
folk
words
came
back
to
her
and
poor
jack
allway
tell
him
i
thank
him
for
all
those
years
of
love
and
gentleness
she
gave
him
the
message
folk
had
been
right
he
was
not
offended
dear
old
chap
he
said
that
was
kind
of
him
he
was
always
generous
he
was
silent
for
a
while
with
a
quiet
look
on
his
face
give
him
our
love
he
said
tell
him
we
came
together
at
the
end
it
was
on
her
tongue
to
ask
him
as
so
often
she
had
meant
to
do
of
late
what
had
been
the
cause
of
her
mother
illness
if
illness
it
was
what
it
was
that
had
happened
to
change
both
their
lives
but
always
something
had
stopped
her
something
ever
present
ever
watchful
that
seemed
to
shape
itself
out
of
the
air
bending
towards
her
with
its
finger
on
its
lips
she
stayed
over
the
and
on
the
saturday
at
her
suggestion
they
took
a
long
excursion
into
the
country
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
asked
him
to
take
her
out
he
came
down
to
breakfast
in
a
new
suit
and
was
quite
excited
in
the
car
his
hand
had
sought
hers
shyly
and
feeling
her
responsive
pressure
he
had
continued
to
hold
it
and
they
had
sat
for
a
long
time
in
silence
she
decided
not
to
tell
him
about
phillips
just
yet
he
knew
of
him
only
from
the
tory
newspapers
and
would
form
a
wrong
idea
she
would
bring
them
together
and
leave
phillips
to
make
his
own
way
he
would
like
phillips
when
he
knew
him
she
felt
sure
he
too
was
a
people
man
the
torch
passed
down
to
him
from
his
old
ironside
ancestors
it
still
glowed
more
than
once
she
had
seen
it
leap
to
flame
in
congenial
atmosphere
it
would
burn
clear
and
steadfast
it
occurred
to
her
what
a
delightful
solution
of
her
problem
if
later
on
her
father
could
be
persuaded
to
leave
arthur
in
charge
of
the
works
and
come
to
live
with
her
in
london
there
was
a
fine
block
of
flats
near
chelsea
church
with
long
views
up
and
down
the
river
how
happy
they
could
be
there
the
in
the
adams
style
with
curtains
he
was
a
father
any
young
woman
could
be
proud
to
take
about
unconsciously
she
gave
his
hand
an
impulsive
squeeze
they
lunched
at
an
old
inn
upon
the
moors
and
the
landlady
judging
from
his
shy
attentive
ways
had
begun
by
addressing
her
as
madame
you
grow
wonderfully
like
your
mother
he
told
her
that
evening
at
dinner
there
used
to
be
something
missing
but
i
do
feel
that
now
she
wrote
to
phillips
to
meet
her
if
possible
at
euston
there
were
things
she
wanted
to
talk
to
him
about
there
was
the
question
whether
she
should
go
on
writing
for
carleton
or
break
with
him
at
once
also
one
or
two
points
that
were
worrying
her
in
connection
with
tariff
reform
he
was
waiting
for
her
on
the
platform
it
appeared
he
too
had
much
to
say
he
wanted
her
advice
concerning
his
next
speech
he
had
not
dined
and
suggested
supper
they
could
not
walk
about
the
streets
likely
enough
it
was
only
her
imagination
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
people
in
the
restaurant
had
recognized
him
and
were
whispering
to
one
another
he
was
bound
to
be
well
known
likewise
her
own
appearance
she
felt
was
against
them
as
regarded
their
desire
to
avoid
observation
she
would
have
to
take
to
those
mousey
colours
that
did
not
suit
her
and
wear
a
veil
she
hated
the
idea
of
a
veil
it
came
from
the
east
and
belonged
there
besides
what
would
be
the
use
unless
he
wore
one
too
who
is
the
veiled
woman
that
phillips
goes
about
with
that
is
what
they
would
ask
it
was
going
to
be
very
awkward
the
whole
thing
viewed
from
the
distance
it
had
looked
quite
fine
dedicating
herself
to
the
service
of
humanity
was
how
it
had
presented
itself
to
her
in
the
garden
at
meudon
the
twinkling
labyrinth
of
paris
at
her
feet
its
sordid
hidden
beneath
its
myriad
lights
she
had
not
bargained
for
the
dedication
involving
the
loss
of
her
they
did
not
talk
as
much
as
they
had
thought
they
would
he
was
not
very
helpful
on
the
carleton
question
there
was
so
much
to
be
said
both
for
and
against
it
might
be
better
to
wait
and
see
how
circumstances
shaped
themselves
she
thought
his
speech
excellent
it
was
difficult
to
discover
any
argument
against
it
he
seemed
to
be
more
interested
in
looking
at
her
when
he
thought
she
was
not
noticing
that
little
faint
vague
fear
came
back
to
her
and
stayed
with
her
but
brought
no
quickening
of
her
pulse
it
was
a
fear
of
something
ugly
she
had
the
feeling
they
were
both
acting
that
everything
depended
upon
their
not
forgetting
their
parts
in
handing
things
to
one
another
they
were
both
of
them
so
careful
that
their
hands
should
not
meet
and
touch
they
walked
together
back
to
westminster
and
wished
each
other
a
short
upon
what
once
had
been
their
common
doorstep
with
her
latchkey
in
her
hand
she
turned
and
watched
his
retreating
figure
and
suddenly
a
wave
of
longing
seized
her
to
run
after
him
and
call
him
back
to
see
his
eyes
light
up
and
feel
the
pressure
of
his
hands
it
was
only
by
clinging
to
the
railings
and
counting
till
she
was
sure
he
had
entered
his
own
house
round
the
corner
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
that
she
restrained
herself
it
was
a
frightened
face
that
looked
at
her
out
of
the
glass
as
she
stood
before
it
taking
off
her
hat
she
decided
that
their
future
meetings
should
be
at
his
own
house
phillips
only
complaint
was
that
she
knocked
at
the
door
too
seldom
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
you
i
really
do
confessed
the
grateful
lady
if
ever
i
become
a
prime
minister
wife
it
you
i
shall
have
to
thank
you
got
so
much
courage
yourself
you
can
put
the
heart
into
him
i
never
had
any
pluck
to
spare
myself
she
concluded
by
giving
joan
a
hug
accompanied
by
a
sloppy
but
heartfelt
kiss
she
would
stand
behind
phillips
chair
with
her
fat
arms
round
his
neck
nodding
her
approval
and
encouragement
while
joan
seated
opposite
would
strain
every
nerve
to
keep
her
brain
fixed
upon
the
argument
never
daring
to
look
at
poor
phillips
wretched
face
with
its
pleading
apologetic
eyes
lest
she
should
burst
into
hysterical
laughter
she
hoped
she
was
being
helpful
and
inspiring
phillips
would
assure
her
afterwards
that
she
had
been
wonderful
as
for
herself
there
were
periods
when
she
had
the
faintest
idea
about
what
she
was
talking
sometimes
phillips
called
away
by
domestic
duty
would
leave
them
returning
full
of
excuses
just
as
they
had
succeeded
in
forgetting
her
it
was
evident
she
was
under
the
impression
that
her
presence
was
useful
to
them
making
it
easier
for
them
to
open
up
their
minds
to
one
another
do
you
be
put
off
by
his
seeming
a
bit
unresponsive
phillips
would
explain
he
shy
with
women
what
i
trying
to
do
is
to
make
him
feel
you
are
one
of
the
family
and
do
you
take
any
notice
of
me
further
explained
the
good
woman
when
i
seem
to
be
in
opposition
like
i
chip
in
now
and
then
on
purpose
just
to
keep
the
ball
rolling
it
stirs
him
up
a
bit
of
contradictoriness
you
have
to
live
with
a
man
before
you
understand
him
one
morning
joan
received
a
letter
from
phillips
marked
immediate
he
informed
her
that
his
brain
was
becoming
addled
he
intended
that
afternoon
to
give
it
a
draught
of
fresh
air
he
would
be
at
the
robin
hood
gate
in
richmond
park
at
three
perhaps
the
gods
would
be
good
to
him
he
would
wait
there
for
half
an
hour
to
give
them
a
chance
anyway
she
slipped
the
letter
unconsciously
into
the
bosom
of
her
dress
and
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
it
promised
to
be
a
glorious
day
and
london
was
stifling
and
gritty
surely
no
one
but
an
prude
could
jib
at
a
walk
across
a
park
phillips
would
be
delighted
to
hear
that
she
had
gone
for
the
matter
of
that
she
would
tell
her
when
next
they
met
phillips
must
have
seen
her
getting
off
the
bus
for
he
came
forward
at
once
from
the
other
side
of
the
gate
his
face
radiant
with
boyish
delight
a
young
man
and
woman
entering
the
park
at
the
same
time
looked
at
them
and
smiled
sympathetically
joan
had
no
idea
the
park
contained
such
pleasant
but
for
an
occasional
perambulator
they
might
have
been
in
the
heart
of
the
country
the
fallow
deer
stole
near
to
them
with
noiseless
feet
regarding
them
out
of
their
large
gentle
eyes
with
looks
of
comradeship
they
paused
and
listened
while
a
missal
thrush
from
a
branch
close
to
them
poured
out
his
song
of
hope
and
courage
from
quite
a
long
way
off
they
could
still
hear
his
clear
voice
singing
telling
to
the
young
and
brave
his
gallant
message
it
seemed
too
beautiful
a
day
for
politics
after
all
politics
one
has
them
always
with
one
but
the
spring
passes
he
saw
her
on
to
a
bus
at
kingston
and
himself
went
back
by
train
they
agreed
they
would
not
mention
it
to
phillips
not
that
she
would
have
minded
the
danger
was
that
she
would
want
to
come
too
honestly
thinking
thereby
to
complete
their
happiness
it
seemed
to
be
tacitly
understood
there
would
be
other
such
excursions
the
summer
was
propitious
phillips
knew
his
london
well
and
how
to
get
away
from
it
there
were
winding
lanes
in
hertfordshire
surrey
hills
and
commons
deep
cool
woods
in
buckingham
each
week
there
was
something
to
look
forward
to
something
to
plan
for
and
manoeuvre
the
sense
of
adventure
a
spice
of
danger
added
zest
she
still
knocked
frequently
as
before
at
the
door
of
the
little
house
in
north
street
but
phillips
no
longer
oppressed
her
as
some
old
man
of
the
sea
she
could
never
hope
to
shake
off
from
her
shoulders
the
flabby
foolish
face
robbed
of
its
terrors
became
merely
pitiful
she
found
herself
able
to
be
quite
gentle
and
patient
with
phillips
even
the
sloppy
kisses
she
came
to
bear
without
a
shudder
down
her
spine
i
know
you
are
only
doing
it
because
you
sympathize
with
his
aims
and
want
him
to
win
acknowledged
the
good
lady
but
i
ca
help
feeling
grateful
to
you
i
do
feel
how
useless
i
am
while
i
got
you
to
run
to
they
still
discussed
their
various
plans
for
the
amelioration
and
improvement
of
humanity
but
there
seemed
less
need
for
haste
than
they
had
thought
the
world
joan
discovered
was
not
so
sad
a
place
as
she
had
judged
it
there
were
chubby
children
whistling
lads
and
smiling
maidens
kindly
men
with
ruddy
faces
happy
mothers
crooning
over
gurgling
babies
there
was
no
call
to
be
fretful
and
vehement
they
would
work
together
in
patience
and
in
confidence
god
sun
was
everywhere
it
needed
only
that
dark
places
should
be
opened
up
and
it
would
enter
sometimes
seated
on
a
lichened
log
or
on
the
short
grass
of
some
sloping
hillside
looking
down
upon
some
quiet
valley
they
would
find
they
had
been
holding
hands
while
talking
it
was
but
as
two
happy
thoughtless
children
might
have
done
they
would
look
at
one
another
with
frank
clear
eyes
and
smile
once
when
their
pathway
led
through
a
littered
he
had
taken
her
up
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
and
she
had
felt
a
glad
pride
in
him
that
he
had
borne
her
lightly
as
if
she
had
been
a
child
looking
up
at
her
and
laughing
an
old
bent
man
paused
from
his
work
and
watched
them
lean
more
over
him
missie
he
advised
her
that
the
way
many
a
mile
i
carried
my
lass
like
that
in
flood
time
and
never
felt
her
weight
often
on
returning
home
not
knowing
why
she
would
look
into
the
glass
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
girlhood
she
had
somehow
missed
was
awakening
in
her
taking
possession
of
her
changing
her
the
lips
she
had
always
seen
pressed
close
and
firm
were
growing
curved
leaving
a
little
parting
as
though
they
were
not
quite
so
satisfied
with
one
another
the
level
brows
were
becoming
slightly
raised
it
gave
her
a
questioning
look
that
was
new
to
her
the
eyes
beneath
were
less
confident
they
seemed
to
be
seeking
something
one
evening
on
her
way
home
from
a
theatre
she
met
flossie
stop
now
said
flossie
who
was
hurrying
but
i
want
to
see
you
most
particular
was
going
to
look
you
up
will
you
be
at
home
afternoon
at
there
was
a
distinct
challenge
in
flossie
eye
as
she
asked
the
question
joan
felt
herself
flush
and
thought
a
moment
yes
she
answered
will
you
be
coming
alone
that
the
idea
answered
flossie
a
heart
to
heart
talk
between
you
and
me
and
nobody
else
four
do
forget
joan
walked
on
slowly
she
had
the
worried
feeling
with
which
once
or
twice
when
a
schoolgirl
she
had
crawled
up
the
stairs
to
bed
after
the
head
mistress
had
informed
her
that
she
would
see
her
in
her
private
room
at
eleven
the
next
morning
leaving
her
to
guess
what
about
it
occurred
to
her
in
trafalgar
square
that
she
had
promised
to
take
tea
with
the
greysons
the
next
afternoon
to
meet
some
big
pot
from
america
she
would
have
to
get
out
of
that
she
felt
it
would
do
to
put
off
flossie
she
went
to
bed
wakeful
it
was
marvellously
like
being
at
school
again
what
could
flossie
want
to
see
her
about
that
was
so
important
she
tried
to
pretend
to
herself
that
she
did
know
after
all
perhaps
it
was
that
but
she
knew
that
it
was
the
instant
flossie
put
up
her
hands
in
order
to
take
off
her
hat
flossie
always
took
off
her
hat
when
she
meant
to
be
unpleasant
it
was
her
way
of
pulling
up
her
sleeves
they
had
their
tea
first
they
seemed
both
agreed
that
that
would
be
best
and
then
flossie
pushed
back
her
chair
and
sat
up
she
had
just
the
head
mistress
expression
joan
was
quite
sure
she
ought
to
stand
but
controlling
the
instinct
leant
back
in
her
chair
and
tried
to
look
defiant
without
feeling
it
how
far
are
you
going
demanded
flossie
joan
was
not
in
a
comprehending
mood
if
you
going
the
whole
hog
that
something
i
can
understand
continued
flossie
if
not
you
better
pull
up
what
do
you
mean
by
the
whole
hog
requested
joan
assuming
dignity
oh
do
come
the
kid
advised
flossie
if
you
do
mind
being
talked
about
yourself
you
might
think
of
him
if
carleton
gets
hold
of
it
he
done
for
little
bird
whispers
to
me
that
robert
phillips
was
seen
walking
across
richmond
park
the
other
afternoon
in
company
with
miss
joan
allway
formerly
one
of
our
contributors
is
that
going
to
end
his
political
career
retorted
joan
with
fine
sarcasm
flossie
fixed
a
relentless
eye
upon
her
he
wait
till
the
bird
has
got
a
bit
more
than
that
to
whisper
to
him
she
suggested
there
be
nothing
more
explained
joan
so
long
as
my
friendship
is
of
any
assistance
to
robert
phillips
in
his
work
he
going
to
have
it
what
use
are
we
going
to
be
in
politics
what
all
the
fuss
about
if
men
and
women
must
work
together
for
their
common
aims
and
help
one
another
why
ca
you
help
him
in
his
own
house
instead
of
wandering
all
about
the
country
flossie
wanted
to
know
so
i
do
joan
defended
herself
i
in
and
out
there
till
i
sick
of
the
hideous
place
you
have
seen
the
inside
and
his
wife
knows
all
about
it
and
is
only
too
glad
does
she
know
about
richmond
park
and
the
other
places
asked
flossie
she
would
mind
if
she
did
explained
joan
and
you
know
what
like
how
can
one
think
what
one
saying
with
that
silly
face
in
front
of
one
always
flossie
since
she
had
become
engaged
had
acquired
quite
a
matronly
train
of
thought
she
spoke
kindly
with
a
little
grave
shake
of
her
head
my
dear
she
said
the
wife
is
always
in
the
way
you
feel
just
the
same
whatever
her
face
was
like
joan
grew
angry
if
you
choose
to
suspect
evil
of
course
you
can
she
answered
with
hauteur
but
you
might
have
known
me
better
i
admire
the
man
and
sympathize
with
him
all
the
things
i
dream
of
are
the
things
he
is
working
for
i
can
do
more
good
by
helping
and
inspiring
him
she
wished
she
had
not
let
slip
that
word
inspire
she
knew
that
flossie
would
fasten
upon
it
than
i
can
ever
accomplish
by
myself
and
i
mean
to
do
it
she
really
did
feel
defiant
now
i
know
dear
agreed
flossie
you
both
of
you
made
up
your
minds
it
shall
always
remain
a
beautiful
union
of
twin
spirits
unfortunately
you
both
got
bodies
rather
attractive
bodies
we
keep
it
off
that
plane
if
you
do
mind
answered
joan
with
a
touch
of
severity
i
willing
enough
answered
flossie
but
what
about
old
mother
nature
she
going
to
be
in
this
you
know
take
off
your
glasses
and
look
at
it
straight
she
went
on
without
giving
joan
time
to
reply
what
is
it
in
us
that
men
if
it
only
advice
and
sympathy
he
after
what
wrong
with
dear
old
denton
she
a
good
walker
except
now
and
then
when
she
got
the
lumbago
why
does
he
get
her
to
him
it
is
only
that
explained
joan
i
give
him
courage
i
always
did
have
more
of
that
than
is
any
use
to
a
woman
he
wants
to
be
worthy
of
my
belief
in
him
what
is
the
harm
if
he
does
admire
me
if
a
smile
from
me
or
a
touch
of
the
hand
can
urge
him
to
fresh
effort
suppose
he
does
love
me
flossie
interrupted
how
about
being
quite
frank
she
suggested
suppose
we
do
love
one
another
how
about
putting
it
that
way
and
suppose
we
do
agreed
joan
her
courage
rising
why
should
we
shun
one
another
as
if
we
were
both
of
us
incapable
of
decency
or
control
why
must
love
be
always
assumed
to
make
us
weak
and
contemptible
as
if
it
were
some
subtle
poison
why
should
it
strengthen
and
ennoble
us
why
did
the
apple
fall
answered
flossie
why
when
it
escapes
from
its
bonds
does
it
soar
upward
if
it
was
for
the
irritating
law
of
gravity
we
could
skip
about
on
the
brink
of
precipices
without
danger
things
being
what
they
are
sensible
people
keep
as
far
away
from
the
edge
as
possible
i
sorry
she
continued
awfully
sorry
old
girl
it
a
bit
of
rotten
bad
luck
for
both
of
you
you
were
just
made
for
one
another
and
fate
knowing
what
was
coming
bustles
round
and
gets
hold
of
poor
silly
phillips
so
as
to
be
able
to
say
unless
it
all
comes
right
in
the
end
she
added
musingly
and
the
poor
old
soul
pegs
out
i
would
give
much
for
her
liver
that
not
bringing
me
up
well
suggested
joan
putting
those
ideas
into
my
head
oh
well
one
ca
help
one
thoughts
explained
flossie
it
would
be
a
blessing
all
round
they
had
risen
joan
folded
her
hands
thank
you
for
your
scolding
she
said
shall
i
write
out
a
hundred
lines
of
greek
or
do
you
think
it
will
be
sufficient
if
i
promise
never
to
do
it
again
you
mean
it
said
flossie
of
course
you
will
go
on
seeing
him
visiting
them
and
all
that
but
you
wo
go
gadding
about
so
that
people
can
talk
only
through
the
bars
in
future
she
promised
with
the
gaoler
between
us
she
put
her
arms
round
flossie
and
bent
her
head
so
that
her
face
was
hidden
flossie
still
seemed
troubled
she
held
on
to
joan
you
are
sure
of
yourself
she
asked
we
only
the
female
of
the
species
we
get
hungry
and
thirsty
too
you
know
that
kiddy
you
joan
laughed
without
raising
her
face
yes
i
know
that
she
answered
i
be
good
she
sat
in
the
dusk
after
flossie
had
gone
and
the
laboured
breathing
of
the
tired
city
came
to
her
through
the
open
window
she
had
rather
fancied
that
martyr
crown
it
had
not
looked
so
very
heavy
the
thorns
not
so
very
alarming
as
seen
through
the
window
she
would
wear
it
bravely
it
would
rather
become
her
facing
the
mirror
of
the
days
to
come
she
tried
it
on
it
was
going
to
hurt
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
she
saw
the
fatuous
approving
face
of
the
eternal
phillips
thrust
ever
between
them
against
the
background
of
that
hideous
furniture
of
those
bilious
wall
papers
the
loneliness
that
would
ever
walk
with
her
sit
down
beside
her
in
the
crowded
restaurant
steal
up
the
staircase
with
her
creep
step
by
step
with
her
from
room
to
room
the
ever
unsatisfied
yearning
for
a
tender
word
a
kindly
touch
yes
it
was
going
to
hurt
poor
robert
it
would
be
hard
on
him
too
she
could
not
help
feeling
consolation
in
the
thought
that
he
also
would
be
wearing
that
invisible
crown
she
must
write
to
him
the
sooner
it
was
done
the
better
half
a
dozen
contradictory
moods
passed
over
her
during
the
composing
of
that
letter
but
to
her
they
seemed
but
the
unfolding
of
a
single
thought
on
one
page
it
might
have
been
his
mother
writing
to
him
an
experienced
sagacious
lady
quite
aware
in
spite
of
her
affection
for
him
of
his
faults
and
weaknesses
solicitous
that
he
should
avoid
the
dangers
of
an
embarrassing
entanglement
his
happiness
being
the
only
consideration
of
importance
on
others
it
might
have
been
a
queen
laying
her
immutable
commands
upon
some
loyal
subject
sworn
to
her
service
part
of
it
might
have
been
written
by
a
laughing
philosopher
who
had
learnt
the
folly
of
taking
life
too
seriously
knowing
that
all
things
pass
that
the
tears
of
will
be
remembered
with
a
smile
and
a
part
of
it
was
the
unconsidered
language
of
a
loving
woman
and
those
were
the
pages
that
he
kissed
his
letter
in
answer
was
much
shorter
of
course
he
would
obey
her
wishes
he
had
been
selfish
thinking
only
of
himself
as
for
his
political
career
he
did
not
see
how
that
was
going
to
suffer
by
his
being
occasionally
seen
in
company
with
one
of
the
most
brilliantly
intellectual
women
in
london
known
to
share
his
views
and
he
care
if
it
did
but
inasmuch
as
she
valued
it
all
things
should
be
sacrificed
to
it
it
was
hers
to
do
what
she
would
with
it
was
the
only
thing
he
had
to
offer
her
their
meetings
became
confined
as
before
to
the
little
house
in
north
street
but
it
really
seemed
as
if
the
gods
appeased
by
their
submission
had
decided
to
be
kind
hilda
was
home
for
the
holidays
and
her
piercing
eyes
took
in
the
situation
at
a
flash
she
appeared
to
have
returned
with
a
and
exacting
affection
for
her
mother
that
astonished
almost
as
much
as
it
delighted
the
poor
lady
feeling
sudden
desire
for
a
walk
or
a
bus
ride
or
to
be
taken
to
an
entertainment
no
one
was
of
any
use
to
hilda
but
her
mother
daddy
had
his
silly
politics
to
think
and
talk
about
he
must
worry
them
out
alone
or
with
the
assistance
of
miss
allway
that
was
what
she
was
there
for
phillips
torn
between
her
sense
of
duty
and
fear
of
losing
this
new
happiness
would
yield
to
the
child
coaxing
often
they
would
be
left
alone
to
discuss
the
nation
needs
uninterrupted
conscientiously
they
would
apply
themselves
to
the
task
always
to
find
that
sooner
or
later
they
were
looking
at
one
another
in
silence
one
day
phillips
burst
into
a
curious
laugh
they
had
been
discussing
the
problem
of
the
smallholder
joan
had
put
a
question
to
him
and
with
a
slight
start
he
had
asked
her
to
repeat
it
but
it
seemed
she
had
forgotten
it
i
had
to
see
our
solicitor
one
morning
he
explained
when
i
was
secretary
to
a
miners
union
up
north
a
point
had
arisen
concerning
the
legality
of
certain
payments
it
was
a
matter
of
vast
importance
to
us
but
he
did
seem
to
be
taking
any
interest
and
suddenly
he
jumped
up
sorry
phillips
he
said
i
got
a
big
trouble
of
my
own
on
at
home
i
guess
you
know
what
and
i
do
seem
to
care
a
damn
about
yours
you
better
see
delauny
if
you
in
a
hurry
and
i
did
he
turned
and
leant
over
his
desk
i
guess
they
have
to
find
another
leader
if
they
in
a
hurry
he
added
i
do
seem
able
to
think
about
turnips
and
cows
do
make
me
feel
i
interfered
with
your
work
only
to
spoil
it
said
joan
i
guess
i
spoiling
yours
too
he
answered
i
not
worth
it
i
might
have
done
something
to
win
you
and
keep
you
i
not
going
to
do
much
without
you
you
mean
my
friendship
is
going
to
be
of
no
use
to
you
asked
joan
he
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
on
her
with
a
pleading
look
for
god
sake
do
take
even
that
away
from
me
he
said
unless
you
want
me
to
go
to
pieces
altogether
a
crust
does
just
keep
one
alive
one
ca
help
thinking
what
a
fine
strong
chap
one
might
be
if
one
was
always
hungry
she
felt
so
sorry
for
him
he
looked
such
a
boy
with
the
angry
tears
in
his
clear
blue
eyes
and
that
little
childish
quivering
of
the
kind
strong
sulky
mouth
she
rose
and
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
turned
his
face
towards
her
she
had
meant
to
scold
him
but
changed
her
mind
and
laid
his
head
against
her
breast
and
held
it
there
he
clung
to
her
as
a
troubled
child
might
with
his
arms
clasped
round
her
and
his
head
against
her
breast
and
a
mist
rose
up
before
her
and
strange
commanding
voices
seemed
calling
to
her
he
could
not
see
her
face
she
watched
it
herself
with
dim
half
consciousness
as
it
changed
before
her
in
the
tawdry
mirror
above
the
mantelpiece
half
longing
that
he
might
look
up
and
see
it
half
terrified
lest
he
should
with
an
effort
that
seemed
to
turn
her
into
stone
she
regained
command
over
herself
i
must
go
now
she
said
in
a
harsh
voice
and
he
released
her
i
afraid
i
an
awful
nuisance
to
you
he
said
i
get
these
moods
at
times
you
not
angry
with
me
no
she
answered
with
a
smile
but
it
will
hurt
me
if
you
fail
remember
that
she
turned
down
the
embankment
after
leaving
the
house
she
always
found
the
river
strong
and
restful
so
it
was
not
only
bad
women
that
needed
to
be
afraid
of
themselves
even
to
the
most
young
woman
with
letters
after
her
name
and
altruistic
interests
even
to
her
also
the
longing
for
the
lover
clasp
flossie
had
been
right
mother
nature
was
not
to
be
flouted
of
her
children
not
even
of
her
new
daughters
to
them
likewise
the
family
trait
she
would
have
run
away
if
she
could
leaving
him
to
guess
at
her
real
reason
if
he
were
smart
enough
but
that
would
have
meant
excuses
and
explanations
all
round
she
was
writing
a
daily
column
of
notes
for
greyson
now
in
addition
to
the
weekly
letter
from
clorinda
and
denton
having
compromised
with
her
first
dreams
was
delegating
to
joan
more
and
more
of
her
work
she
wrote
to
phillips
that
she
was
feeling
unwell
and
would
be
unable
to
lunch
with
them
on
the
sunday
as
had
been
arranged
phillips
much
disappointed
suggested
wednesday
but
it
seemed
on
wednesday
she
was
no
better
and
so
it
drifted
on
for
about
a
fortnight
without
her
finding
the
courage
to
come
to
any
decision
and
then
one
morning
turning
the
corner
into
abingdon
street
she
felt
a
slight
pull
at
her
sleeve
and
hilda
was
beside
her
the
child
had
shown
an
uncanny
intuition
in
not
knocking
at
the
door
joan
had
been
fearing
that
and
would
have
sent
down
word
that
she
was
out
but
it
had
to
be
faced
are
you
never
coming
again
asked
the
child
of
course
answered
joan
when
i
better
i
not
very
well
just
now
it
the
weather
i
suppose
the
child
turned
her
head
as
they
walked
and
looked
at
her
joan
felt
herself
smarting
under
that
look
but
persisted
i
very
much
run
down
she
said
i
may
have
to
go
away
you
promised
to
help
him
said
the
child
i
ca
if
i
ill
retorted
joan
besides
i
am
helping
him
there
are
other
ways
of
helping
people
than
by
wasting
their
time
talking
to
them
he
wants
you
said
the
child
it
your
being
there
that
helps
him
joan
stopped
and
turned
did
he
send
you
she
asked
no
the
child
answered
mama
had
a
headache
this
morning
and
i
slipped
out
you
not
keeping
your
promise
palace
yard
save
for
a
statuesque
policeman
was
empty
how
do
you
know
that
my
being
with
him
helps
him
asked
joan
you
know
things
when
you
love
anybody
explained
the
child
you
feel
them
you
will
come
again
soon
joan
did
not
answer
you
frightened
the
child
continued
in
a
passionate
low
voice
you
think
that
people
will
talk
about
you
and
look
down
upon
you
you
ought
to
think
about
yourself
you
ought
to
think
only
about
him
and
his
work
nothing
else
matters
i
am
thinking
about
him
and
his
work
joan
answered
her
hand
sought
hilda
and
held
it
there
are
things
you
do
understand
men
and
women
ca
help
each
other
in
the
way
you
think
they
may
try
to
and
mean
no
harm
in
the
beginning
but
the
harm
comes
and
then
not
only
the
woman
but
the
man
also
suffers
and
his
work
is
spoilt
and
his
life
ruined
the
small
hot
hand
clasped
joan
convulsively
but
he
wo
be
able
to
do
his
work
if
you
keep
away
and
never
come
back
to
him
she
persisted
oh
i
know
it
it
all
depends
upon
you
he
wants
you
and
i
want
him
if
that
any
consolation
to
you
joan
answered
with
a
short
laugh
it
was
much
of
a
confession
the
child
was
cute
enough
to
have
found
that
out
for
herself
only
you
see
i
ca
have
him
and
there
an
end
of
it
they
had
reached
the
abbey
joan
turned
and
they
retraced
their
steps
slowly
i
shall
be
going
away
soon
for
a
little
while
she
said
the
talk
had
helped
her
to
decision
when
i
come
back
i
will
come
and
see
you
all
and
you
must
all
come
and
see
me
now
and
then
i
expect
i
shall
have
a
flat
of
my
own
my
father
may
be
coming
to
live
with
me
do
all
you
can
to
help
him
she
stooped
and
kissed
the
child
straining
her
to
her
almost
fiercely
but
the
child
lips
were
cold
she
did
not
look
back
miss
greyson
was
sympathetic
towards
her
desire
for
a
longish
holiday
and
wonderfully
helpful
and
denton
also
approved
and
to
surprise
kissed
her
denton
was
not
given
to
kissing
she
wired
to
her
father
and
got
his
reply
the
same
evening
he
would
be
at
her
rooms
on
the
day
she
had
fixed
with
his
travelling
bag
and
at
her
orders
with
love
and
many
thanks
he
had
added
she
waited
till
the
day
before
starting
to
run
round
and
say
to
the
phillipses
she
felt
it
would
be
unwise
to
try
and
get
out
of
doing
that
both
phillips
and
hilda
she
was
thankful
were
out
and
she
and
phillips
had
tea
alone
together
the
talk
was
difficult
so
far
as
joan
was
concerned
if
the
woman
had
been
possessed
of
ordinary
intuition
she
might
have
arrived
at
the
truth
joan
almost
wished
she
would
it
would
make
her
own
future
task
the
easier
but
phillips
it
was
clear
was
going
to
be
no
help
to
her
for
her
father
sake
she
made
pretence
of
eagerness
but
as
the
sea
widened
between
her
and
the
harbour
lights
it
seemed
as
if
a
part
of
herself
were
being
torn
away
from
her
they
travelled
leisurely
through
holland
and
the
rhine
land
and
that
helped
a
little
the
new
scenes
and
interests
and
in
switzerland
they
discovered
a
delightful
little
village
in
an
upland
valley
with
just
one
small
hotel
and
decided
to
stay
there
for
a
while
so
as
to
give
themselves
time
to
get
their
letters
they
took
long
walks
and
climbs
returning
tired
and
hungry
looking
forward
to
their
dinner
and
the
evening
talk
with
the
few
other
guests
on
the
veranda
the
days
passed
restfully
in
that
hidden
valley
the
great
white
mountains
closed
her
in
they
seemed
so
strong
and
clean
it
was
on
the
morning
they
were
leaving
that
a
telegram
was
put
into
her
hands
phillips
was
ill
at
lodgings
in
folkestone
she
hoped
that
joan
on
her
way
back
would
come
to
see
her
she
showed
the
telegram
to
her
father
do
you
mind
dad
if
we
go
straight
back
she
asked
no
dear
he
answered
if
you
wish
it
i
would
like
to
go
back
she
said
chapter
xiii
phillips
was
sitting
up
in
an
easy
chair
near
the
windows
when
joan
arrived
it
was
a
pleasant
little
house
in
the
old
part
of
the
town
and
looked
out
upon
the
harbour
she
was
startlingly
thin
by
comparison
with
what
she
had
been
but
her
face
was
still
painted
phillips
would
run
down
by
the
afternoon
train
whenever
he
could
get
away
she
never
knew
when
he
was
coming
so
she
explained
and
she
could
not
bear
the
idea
of
his
finding
her
old
and
ugly
she
had
fought
against
his
wish
that
she
should
go
into
a
nursing
home
and
joan
who
in
the
course
of
her
work
upon
the
had
acquired
some
knowledge
of
them
as
a
whole
was
inclined
to
agree
with
her
she
was
quite
comfortable
where
she
was
the
landlady
according
to
her
account
was
a
dear
she
had
sent
the
nurse
out
for
a
walk
on
getting
wire
so
that
they
could
have
a
cosy
chat
she
did
really
want
much
attendance
it
was
her
heart
it
got
feeble
now
and
then
and
she
had
to
keep
very
still
that
was
all
joan
told
how
her
father
had
suffered
for
years
from
much
the
same
complaint
so
long
as
you
were
careful
there
was
no
danger
she
must
take
things
easily
and
not
excite
herself
phillips
acquiesced
it
turning
me
into
a
she
said
with
a
smile
i
can
sit
here
by
the
hour
just
watching
the
bustle
i
was
always
one
for
a
bit
of
life
the
landlady
entered
with
joan
tea
joan
took
an
instinctive
dislike
to
her
she
was
a
large
flashy
woman
wearing
a
quantity
of
cheap
jewellery
her
familiarity
had
about
it
something
almost
threatening
joan
waited
till
she
heard
the
woman
heavy
tread
descending
the
stairs
before
she
expressed
her
opinion
i
think
she
only
means
to
be
cheerful
explained
phillips
quite
a
good
sort
when
you
know
her
the
subject
seemed
in
some
way
to
trouble
her
and
joan
dropped
it
they
watched
the
loading
of
a
steamer
while
joan
drank
her
tea
he
will
come
this
afternoon
i
fancy
said
phillips
i
seem
to
feel
it
he
will
be
able
to
see
you
home
joan
started
she
had
been
thinking
about
phillips
wondering
what
she
should
say
to
him
when
they
met
what
does
he
think
she
asked
about
your
illness
oh
it
worries
him
of
course
poor
dear
phillips
answered
you
see
i
always
been
such
a
as
a
rule
but
i
think
getting
more
hopeful
as
i
tell
him
i
be
all
right
by
the
autumn
it
was
that
spell
of
hot
weather
that
knocked
me
over
joan
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
she
did
quite
know
what
to
say
the
woman
altered
appearance
had
shocked
her
suddenly
she
felt
a
touch
upon
her
hand
you
look
after
him
if
anything
does
happen
wo
you
the
eyes
were
pleading
with
her
they
seemed
to
have
grown
larger
you
know
what
i
mean
dear
do
you
she
continued
it
will
be
such
a
comfort
to
me
to
know
that
it
all
right
in
answer
the
tears
sprang
to
joan
eyes
she
knelt
down
and
put
her
arms
about
the
woman
do
be
so
silly
she
cried
there
nothing
going
to
happen
going
to
get
fat
and
well
again
and
live
to
see
him
prime
minister
i
am
getting
thin
ai
i
she
said
i
always
wanted
to
be
thin
they
both
laughed
but
i
sha
see
him
that
even
if
i
do
live
she
went
on
never
be
that
without
you
and
i
be
so
proud
to
think
that
he
would
i
should
mind
going
then
she
added
joan
did
not
answer
there
seemed
no
words
that
would
come
you
will
promise
wo
you
she
persisted
in
a
whisper
it
only
case
just
that
i
need
worry
myself
joan
looked
up
there
was
something
in
the
eyes
looking
down
upon
her
that
seemed
to
be
compelling
her
if
you
promise
to
try
and
get
better
she
answered
phillips
stooped
and
kissed
her
of
course
dear
she
said
perhaps
i
shall
now
that
my
mind
is
easier
phillips
came
as
phillips
had
predicted
he
was
surprised
at
seeing
joan
he
had
not
thought
she
could
get
back
so
soon
he
brought
an
evening
paper
with
him
it
contained
a
paragraph
to
the
effect
that
phillips
wife
of
the
rt
hon
robert
phillips
was
progressing
favourably
and
hoped
soon
to
be
sufficiently
recovered
to
return
to
her
london
residence
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
had
a
paragraph
all
to
herself
headed
with
her
name
she
flushed
with
pleasure
and
joan
noticed
that
after
reading
it
again
she
folded
the
paper
up
small
and
slipped
it
into
her
pocket
the
nurse
came
in
from
her
walk
a
little
later
and
took
joan
downstairs
with
her
she
ought
not
to
talk
to
more
than
one
person
at
a
time
the
nurse
explained
with
a
shake
of
the
head
she
was
a
quiet
woman
she
would
not
express
a
definite
opinion
it
her
mental
state
that
is
the
trouble
was
all
that
she
would
say
she
ought
to
be
getting
better
but
she
does
you
not
a
christian
scientist
by
any
chance
she
asked
joan
suddenly
no
answered
joan
surely
you
not
one
i
do
know
answered
the
woman
i
believe
that
would
do
her
more
good
than
anything
else
if
she
would
listen
to
it
she
seems
to
have
lost
all
the
nurse
left
her
and
the
landlady
came
in
to
lay
the
table
she
understood
that
joan
would
be
dining
with
phillips
there
was
no
train
till
the
she
kept
looking
at
joan
as
she
moved
about
the
room
joan
was
afraid
she
would
begin
to
talk
but
she
must
have
felt
joan
antagonism
for
she
remained
silent
once
their
eyes
met
and
the
woman
leered
at
her
phillips
came
down
looking
more
cheerful
he
had
detected
improvement
in
phillips
she
was
more
hopeful
in
herself
they
talked
in
low
tones
during
the
meal
as
people
do
whose
thoughts
are
elsewhere
it
happened
quite
suddenly
phillips
explained
they
had
come
down
a
few
days
after
the
rising
of
parliament
there
had
been
a
spell
of
hot
weather
but
nothing
remarkable
the
first
attack
had
occurred
about
three
weeks
ago
it
was
just
after
hilda
had
gone
back
to
school
he
was
sure
whether
he
ought
to
send
for
hilda
or
not
her
mother
did
want
him
to
not
just
yet
of
course
if
she
got
worse
he
would
have
to
what
did
joan
think
did
she
think
there
was
any
real
danger
joan
could
not
say
so
much
depended
upon
the
general
state
of
health
there
was
the
case
of
her
own
father
of
course
she
would
always
be
subject
to
attacks
but
this
one
would
have
warned
her
to
be
careful
phillips
thought
that
living
out
of
town
might
be
better
for
her
in
the
future
somewhere
in
surrey
where
he
could
easily
get
up
and
down
he
could
sleep
himself
at
the
club
on
nights
when
he
had
to
be
late
they
talked
without
looking
at
one
another
they
did
not
speak
about
themselves
phillips
was
in
bed
when
joan
went
up
to
say
you
come
again
soon
she
asked
and
joan
promised
you
made
me
so
happy
she
whispered
the
nurse
was
in
the
room
they
discussed
politics
in
the
train
phillips
had
found
more
support
for
his
crusade
against
carleton
than
he
had
expected
he
was
going
to
open
the
attack
at
once
thus
forestalling
carleton
opposition
to
his
land
scheme
it
is
going
to
be
the
and
the
and
the
the
all
combined
to
down
me
i
going
to
tell
the
people
that
it
carleton
and
only
carleton
carleton
here
carleton
there
carleton
everywhere
against
them
i
going
to
drag
him
out
into
the
open
and
make
him
put
up
his
own
fists
joan
undertook
to
sound
greyson
she
was
sure
greyson
would
support
him
in
his
balanced
gentlemanly
way
that
could
nevertheless
be
quite
deadly
they
grew
less
and
less
afraid
of
looking
at
one
another
as
they
felt
that
darkened
room
further
and
further
behind
them
they
parted
at
charing
cross
joan
would
write
they
agreed
it
would
be
better
to
choose
separate
days
for
their
visits
to
folkestone
she
ran
against
madge
in
the
morning
and
invited
herself
to
tea
her
father
had
returned
to
liverpool
and
her
own
rooms
for
some
reason
depressed
her
flossie
was
there
with
young
halliday
they
were
both
off
the
next
morning
to
his
people
place
in
devonshire
from
where
they
were
going
to
get
married
and
had
come
to
say
flossie
put
sam
in
the
passage
and
the
door
have
you
seen
her
she
asked
how
is
she
oh
she
changed
a
good
deal
answered
joan
but
i
think
she
get
over
it
all
right
if
she
careful
i
shall
hope
for
the
best
answered
flossie
poor
old
soul
she
had
a
good
time
do
send
me
a
present
and
then
i
need
send
you
one
when
your
time
comes
it
a
silly
custom
besides
i
nowhere
to
put
it
shall
be
in
a
ship
for
the
next
six
months
will
let
you
know
when
we
back
she
gave
joan
a
hug
and
a
kiss
and
was
gone
joan
joined
madge
in
the
kitchen
where
she
was
toasting
buns
i
suppose
she
satisfied
herself
that
he
brainy
she
laughed
oh
brains
are
everything
answered
madge
some
of
the
worst
rotters
the
world
has
ever
been
cursed
with
have
been
brainy
enough
men
and
women
we
make
too
much
fuss
about
brains
just
as
once
upon
a
time
we
did
about
mere
brute
strength
thinking
that
was
all
that
was
needed
to
make
a
man
great
brain
is
only
muscle
translated
into
civilization
that
not
going
to
save
us
you
been
thinking
joan
accused
her
what
put
all
that
into
your
head
madge
laughed
mixing
with
so
many
brainy
people
perhaps
she
suggested
and
wondering
what
become
of
their
souls
be
good
sweet
child
and
let
who
can
be
clever
joan
quoted
would
that
be
your
text
madge
finished
buttering
her
buns
kant
was
it
she
answered
who
marvelled
chiefly
at
two
things
the
starry
firmament
above
him
and
the
moral
law
within
him
and
they
one
and
the
same
if
he
only
thought
it
out
it
rather
big
to
be
good
they
carried
their
tea
into
the
do
you
really
think
she
get
over
it
asked
madge
or
is
it
one
of
those
things
one
has
to
say
i
think
she
could
answered
joan
if
she
would
pull
herself
together
it
her
lack
of
that
the
trouble
madge
did
not
reply
immediately
she
was
watching
the
rooks
settling
down
for
the
night
in
the
elm
trees
just
beyond
the
window
there
seemed
to
be
much
need
of
coming
and
going
of
much
cawing
i
met
her
pretty
often
during
those
months
that
helen
lavery
was
running
her
round
she
said
at
length
it
always
seemed
to
me
to
have
a
touch
of
the
heroic
that
absurd
effort
she
was
making
to
herself
so
that
she
might
be
of
use
to
him
i
can
see
her
doing
something
quite
big
if
she
thought
it
would
help
him
the
cawing
of
the
rooks
grew
fainter
one
by
one
they
folded
their
wings
neither
spoke
for
a
while
later
on
they
talked
about
the
coming
election
if
the
party
got
back
phillips
would
go
to
the
board
of
trade
it
would
afford
him
a
better
platform
for
the
introduction
of
his
land
scheme
what
do
you
gather
is
the
general
opinion
joan
asked
that
he
will
succeed
the
general
opinion
seems
to
be
that
his
star
is
in
the
ascendant
madge
answered
with
a
smile
that
all
things
are
working
together
for
his
good
it
rather
a
useful
atmosphere
to
have
about
one
that
it
breeds
friendship
and
support
joan
looked
at
her
watch
she
had
an
article
to
finish
madge
stood
on
tiptoe
and
kissed
her
do
think
me
unsympathetic
she
said
no
one
will
rejoice
more
than
i
shall
if
god
sees
fit
to
call
you
to
good
work
but
i
ca
help
letting
fall
my
little
tear
of
fellowship
with
the
weeping
and
mind
your
p
and
q
she
added
you
in
a
difficult
position
and
not
all
the
eyes
watching
you
are
friendly
joan
bore
the
germ
of
worry
in
her
breast
as
she
crossed
the
gray
inn
garden
it
was
a
hard
law
that
of
the
world
knowing
only
winners
and
losers
of
course
the
woman
was
to
be
pitied
no
one
could
feel
more
sorry
for
her
than
joan
herself
but
what
had
madge
exactly
meant
by
those
words
that
she
could
see
her
doing
something
really
big
if
she
thought
it
would
help
him
there
was
no
doubt
about
her
affection
for
him
it
was
almost
and
the
child
also
there
must
be
something
quite
exceptional
about
him
to
have
won
the
devotion
of
two
such
opposite
beings
especially
hilda
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
any
lengths
to
which
hilda
blind
idolatry
would
not
lead
her
she
ran
down
twice
to
folkestone
during
the
following
week
her
visits
made
her
mind
easier
phillips
seemed
so
placid
so
contented
there
was
no
suggestion
of
suffering
either
mental
or
physical
she
dined
with
the
greysons
the
sunday
after
and
mooted
the
question
of
the
coming
fight
with
carleton
greyson
thought
phillips
would
find
plenty
of
journalistic
backing
the
concentration
of
the
press
into
the
hands
of
a
few
conscienceless
schemers
was
threatening
to
reduce
the
journalist
to
a
mere
hireling
and
the
men
were
becoming
seriously
alarmed
he
found
in
his
desk
the
report
of
a
speech
made
by
a
leader
writer
at
a
recent
dinner
of
the
press
club
the
man
had
risen
to
respond
to
the
toast
of
his
own
health
and
had
taken
the
opportunity
to
unpack
his
heart
i
am
paid
a
thousand
a
year
so
greyson
read
to
them
for
keeping
my
own
opinions
out
of
my
paper
some
of
you
perhaps
earn
more
and
others
less
but
you
getting
it
for
writing
what
you
told
if
i
were
to
be
so
foolish
as
to
express
my
honest
opinion
i
be
on
the
street
the
next
morning
looking
for
another
job
the
business
of
the
journalist
the
man
had
continued
is
to
destroy
the
truth
to
lie
to
pervert
to
vilify
to
fawn
at
the
feet
of
mammon
to
sell
his
soul
for
his
daily
bread
we
are
the
tools
and
vassals
of
rich
men
behind
the
scenes
we
are
the
they
pull
the
strings
and
we
dance
our
talents
our
possibilities
our
lives
are
the
property
of
other
men
we
tried
to
pretend
it
was
only
one
of
jack
little
jokes
explained
greyson
as
he
folded
up
the
cutting
but
it
would
work
it
was
too
near
the
truth
i
do
see
what
you
are
going
to
do
commented
mary
so
long
as
men
are
not
afraid
to
sell
their
souls
there
will
always
be
a
devil
market
for
them
greyson
did
not
so
much
mind
there
being
a
devil
market
provided
he
could
be
assured
of
an
honest
market
alongside
so
that
a
man
could
take
his
choice
what
he
feared
was
the
devil
steady
encroachment
that
could
only
end
by
the
closing
of
the
independent
market
altogether
his
remedy
was
the
introduction
of
the
american
trust
law
forbidding
any
one
man
being
interested
in
more
than
a
limited
number
of
journals
but
what
the
difference
demanded
joan
between
a
man
owning
one
paper
with
a
circulation
of
say
six
millions
or
owning
six
with
a
circulation
of
a
million
apiece
by
concentrating
all
his
energies
on
one
a
man
with
carleton
organizing
genius
might
easily
establish
a
single
journal
that
would
cover
the
whole
field
just
all
the
difference
answered
greyson
between
pooh
bah
as
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
or
lord
high
admiral
or
chief
executioner
whichever
he
preferred
to
be
and
pooh
bah
as
all
the
officers
of
state
rolled
into
one
pooh
bah
may
be
a
very
able
statesman
entitled
to
exert
his
legitimate
influence
but
after
all
his
opinion
is
only
the
opinion
of
one
old
gentleman
with
possible
prejudices
and
preconceived
convictions
the
mikado
or
the
people
according
to
locality
would
like
to
hear
the
views
of
others
of
his
ministers
he
finds
that
the
lord
chancellor
and
the
lord
chief
justice
and
the
groom
of
the
bedchamber
and
the
the
whole
entire
cabinet
in
short
are
unanimously
of
the
same
opinion
as
pooh
bah
he
does
know
only
pooh
bah
speaking
from
different
corners
of
the
stage
the
consensus
of
opinion
convinces
him
one
statesman
however
eminent
might
err
in
judgment
but
half
a
score
of
statesmen
all
of
one
mind
one
must
accept
their
verdict
mary
smiled
but
why
should
the
good
newspaper
proprietor
hurry
up
and
become
a
she
suggested
why
do
you
persuade
lord
sutcliffe
to
buy
up
three
or
four
papers
before
they
all
gone
because
i
do
want
the
devil
to
get
hold
of
him
answered
greyson
you
got
to
face
this
unalterable
law
he
continued
that
power
derived
from
worldly
sources
can
only
be
employed
for
worldly
purposes
the
power
conferred
by
popularity
by
wealth
by
that
ability
to
make
use
of
other
men
that
we
term
organization
sooner
or
later
the
man
who
wields
that
power
becomes
the
devil
servant
so
long
as
kingship
was
merely
a
force
struggling
against
anarchy
it
was
a
holy
weapon
as
it
grew
in
power
so
it
degenerated
into
an
instrument
of
tyranny
the
church
so
long
as
it
remained
a
scattered
body
of
meek
lowly
men
did
the
lord
work
enthroned
at
rome
it
thundered
its
edicts
against
human
thought
the
press
is
in
danger
of
following
precisely
the
same
history
when
it
wrote
in
fear
of
the
pillory
and
of
the
jail
it
fought
for
liberty
now
it
has
become
the
fourth
estate
it
fawns
as
jack
swinton
said
of
it
at
the
feet
of
mammon
my
proprietor
good
fellow
allows
me
to
cultivate
my
plot
amid
the
wilderness
for
other
purposes
than
those
of
quick
returns
if
he
were
to
become
a
competitor
with
the
carletons
and
the
bloomfields
he
would
have
to
look
upon
it
as
a
business
proposition
the
devil
would
take
him
up
on
to
the
high
mountain
and
point
out
to
him
the
kingdom
of
huge
circulations
and
vast
profits
whispering
to
him
this
will
i
give
thee
if
thou
wilt
fall
down
and
worship
me
i
do
want
the
dear
good
fellow
to
be
tempted
is
it
impossible
then
to
combine
duty
and
success
questioned
joan
the
combination
sometimes
happens
by
chance
admitted
greyson
but
it
dangerous
to
seek
it
it
is
so
easy
to
persuade
ourselves
that
our
duty
to
succeed
but
we
must
succeed
to
be
of
use
urged
mary
must
god
servants
always
remain
powerless
powerless
to
rule
powerful
only
to
serve
he
answered
powerful
as
christ
was
powerful
not
as
caesar
was
powerful
powerful
as
those
who
have
suffered
and
have
failed
leaders
of
forlorn
hopes
powerful
as
those
who
have
struggled
on
despised
and
vilified
not
as
those
of
whom
all
men
speak
well
powerful
as
those
who
have
fought
lone
battles
and
have
died
not
knowing
their
own
victory
it
is
those
that
serve
not
those
that
rule
shall
conquer
joan
had
never
known
him
quite
so
serious
generally
there
was
a
touch
of
irony
in
his
talk
a
suggestion
of
aloofness
that
had
often
irritated
her
i
wish
you
would
always
be
yourself
as
you
are
now
she
said
and
never
pose
do
i
pose
he
asked
raising
his
eyebrows
that
shows
how
far
it
has
gone
she
told
him
that
you
do
even
know
it
you
pretend
to
be
a
philosopher
but
you
really
a
man
he
laughed
it
is
always
a
pose
he
explained
it
some
way
of
saying
thy
will
be
done
ask
phillips
to
come
and
see
me
he
said
i
can
be
of
more
help
if
i
know
exactly
his
views
he
walked
with
her
to
the
bus
they
passed
a
corner
house
that
he
had
more
than
once
pointed
out
to
her
it
had
belonged
years
ago
to
a
known
artist
who
had
worked
out
a
wonderful
scheme
of
decoration
in
the
a
board
was
up
announcing
that
the
house
was
for
sale
a
gas
lamp
exactly
opposite
threw
a
flood
of
light
upon
the
huge
white
lettering
joan
stopped
why
it
the
house
you
are
always
talking
about
she
said
are
you
thinking
of
taking
it
i
did
go
over
it
he
answered
but
it
would
be
rather
absurd
for
just
mary
and
me
she
looked
up
phillips
at
the
house
and
gave
him
greyson
message
he
had
just
returned
from
folkestone
and
was
worried
she
was
so
much
better
last
week
he
explained
but
it
never
lasts
poor
old
girl
he
added
i
believe
she
have
been
happier
if
always
remained
plain
bob
phillips
joan
had
promised
to
go
down
on
the
friday
but
finding
on
the
thursday
morning
that
it
would
be
difficult
decided
to
run
down
that
afternoon
instead
she
thought
at
first
of
sending
a
wire
but
in
state
of
health
telegrams
were
perhaps
to
be
avoided
it
could
make
no
difference
the
front
door
of
the
little
house
was
standing
half
open
she
called
down
the
kitchen
stairs
to
the
landlady
but
received
no
answer
the
woman
had
probably
run
out
on
some
short
errand
she
went
up
the
stairs
softly
the
bedroom
door
she
knew
would
be
open
phillips
had
a
feeling
against
being
shut
off
as
she
called
it
she
meant
to
tap
lightly
and
walk
straight
in
as
usual
but
what
she
saw
through
the
opening
caused
her
to
pause
phillips
was
sitting
up
in
bed
with
her
box
of
cosmetics
in
front
of
her
she
was
sensitive
of
anyone
seeing
her
and
joan
knowing
this
drew
back
a
step
but
for
some
reason
she
could
help
watching
phillips
dipped
a
brush
into
one
of
the
compartments
and
then
remained
with
it
in
her
hand
as
if
hesitating
suddenly
she
stuck
out
her
tongue
and
passed
the
brush
over
it
at
least
so
it
seemed
to
joan
it
was
only
a
side
view
of
phillips
face
that
she
was
obtaining
and
she
may
have
been
mistaken
it
might
have
been
the
lips
the
woman
gave
a
little
gasp
and
sat
still
for
a
moment
then
putting
away
the
brush
she
closed
the
box
and
slipped
it
under
the
pillow
joan
felt
her
knees
trembling
a
cold
creeping
fear
was
taking
possession
of
her
why
she
could
not
understand
she
must
have
been
mistaken
people
do
their
tongues
it
must
have
been
the
lips
and
even
if
not
if
the
woman
had
licked
the
brush
it
was
a
silly
trick
people
do
perhaps
she
liked
the
taste
she
pulled
herself
together
and
tapped
at
the
door
phillips
gave
a
little
start
at
seeing
her
but
was
glad
that
she
had
come
phillips
had
not
been
down
for
two
days
and
she
had
been
feeling
lonesome
she
persisted
in
talking
more
than
joan
felt
was
good
for
her
she
was
feeling
so
much
better
she
explained
joan
was
relieved
when
the
nurse
came
back
from
her
walk
and
insisted
on
her
lying
down
she
dropped
to
sleep
while
joan
and
the
nurse
were
having
their
tea
joan
went
back
by
the
early
train
she
met
some
people
at
the
station
that
she
knew
and
travelled
up
with
them
that
picture
of
phillips
tongue
just
showing
beyond
the
line
of
phillips
cheek
remained
at
the
back
of
her
mind
but
it
was
not
until
she
was
alone
in
her
own
rooms
that
she
dared
let
her
thoughts
return
to
it
the
suggestion
that
was
forcing
itself
into
her
brain
was
monstrous
unthinkable
that
never
possessed
of
any
surplus
vitality
and
suffering
from
the
added
lassitude
of
illness
the
woman
should
have
become
indifferent
willing
to
let
a
life
that
to
her
was
full
of
fears
and
difficulties
slip
peacefully
away
from
her
that
was
possible
but
that
she
should
exercise
thought
and
ingenuity
that
she
should
have
reasoned
the
thing
out
and
deliberately
laid
her
plans
calculating
at
every
point
on
their
success
it
was
inconceivable
besides
what
could
have
put
the
idea
into
her
head
it
was
laughable
the
presumption
that
she
was
a
finished
actress
capable
of
deceiving
everyone
about
her
if
she
had
had
an
inkling
of
the
truth
joan
with
every
nerve
on
the
alert
almost
hoping
for
it
would
have
detected
it
she
had
talked
with
her
alone
the
day
before
she
had
left
england
and
the
woman
had
been
full
of
hopes
and
projects
for
the
future
that
picture
of
phillips
propped
up
against
the
pillows
with
her
box
upon
her
knees
was
still
before
her
when
she
went
to
bed
all
night
long
it
haunted
her
whether
thinking
or
dreaming
of
it
she
could
not
tell
suddenly
she
sat
up
with
a
stifled
cry
it
seemed
as
if
a
flash
of
light
had
been
turned
upon
her
almost
blinding
her
hilda
why
had
she
never
thought
of
it
the
whole
thing
was
so
obvious
you
ought
not
to
think
about
yourself
you
ought
to
think
only
of
him
and
of
his
work
nothing
else
matters
if
she
could
say
that
to
joan
what
might
she
not
have
said
to
her
mother
who
so
clearly
she
divined
to
be
the
incubus
the
drag
upon
her
father
career
she
could
hear
the
child
dry
passionate
tones
could
see
phillips
flabby
cheeks
grow
white
the
frightened
staring
eyes
where
her
father
was
concerned
the
child
had
neither
conscience
nor
compassion
she
had
waited
her
time
it
was
a
few
days
after
hilda
return
to
school
that
phillips
had
been
first
taken
she
flung
herself
from
the
bed
and
drew
the
blind
a
chill
grey
light
penetrated
the
room
it
was
a
little
before
five
she
would
go
round
to
phillips
wake
him
up
he
must
be
told
with
her
hat
in
her
hands
she
paused
no
that
would
not
do
phillips
must
never
know
they
must
keep
the
secret
to
themselves
she
would
go
down
and
see
the
woman
reason
with
her
insist
she
went
into
the
other
room
it
was
lighter
there
the
was
standing
in
its
usual
place
upon
her
desk
there
was
a
train
to
folkestone
at
she
had
plenty
of
time
it
would
be
wise
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
and
something
to
eat
there
would
be
no
sense
in
arriving
there
with
a
headache
she
would
want
her
brain
clear
it
was
five
when
she
sat
down
with
her
tea
in
front
of
her
it
was
only
ten
minutes
walk
to
charing
cross
say
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
might
pick
up
a
cab
she
grew
calmer
as
she
ate
and
drank
her
reason
seemed
to
be
returning
to
her
there
was
no
such
violent
hurry
had
she
better
think
things
over
in
the
clear
daylight
the
woman
had
been
ill
now
for
nearly
six
weeks
a
few
hours
a
day
or
two
could
make
no
difference
it
might
alarm
the
poor
creature
her
unexpected
appearance
at
such
an
unusual
hour
cause
a
relapse
suppose
she
had
been
mistaken
had
she
better
make
a
few
inquiries
first
feel
her
way
one
did
harm
more
often
than
good
acting
on
impulse
after
all
had
she
the
right
to
interfere
ought
the
thing
to
be
thought
over
as
a
whole
might
there
be
arguments
worth
considering
against
her
interference
her
brain
was
too
much
in
a
whirl
had
she
better
wait
till
she
could
collect
and
arrange
her
thoughts
the
silver
clock
upon
her
desk
struck
six
it
had
been
a
gift
from
her
father
when
she
was
at
girton
it
never
obtruded
its
voice
was
a
faint
musical
chime
that
she
need
not
hear
unless
she
cared
to
listen
she
turned
and
looked
at
it
it
seemed
to
be
a
little
face
looking
back
at
her
out
of
its
two
round
blinkless
eyes
for
the
first
time
during
all
the
years
that
it
had
watched
beside
her
she
heard
its
quick
impatient
tick
she
sat
motionless
staring
at
it
the
problem
in
some
way
had
simplified
itself
into
a
contest
between
herself
demanding
time
to
think
and
the
little
insistent
clock
shouting
to
her
to
act
upon
blind
impulse
if
she
could
remain
motionless
for
another
five
minutes
she
would
have
won
the
ticking
of
the
little
clock
was
filling
the
room
the
thing
seemed
to
have
become
alive
to
be
threatening
to
burst
its
heart
but
the
thin
delicate
indicator
moved
on
suddenly
its
ticking
ceased
it
had
become
again
a
piece
of
lifeless
mechanism
the
hands
pointed
to
six
minutes
past
joan
took
off
her
hat
and
laid
it
aside
she
must
think
the
whole
thing
over
quietly
chapter
xiv
she
could
help
him
without
her
he
would
fail
the
woman
herself
saw
that
and
wished
it
why
should
she
hesitate
it
was
not
as
if
she
had
only
herself
to
consider
the
fate
the
happiness
of
millions
was
at
stake
he
looked
to
her
for
aid
for
guidance
it
must
have
been
intended
all
roads
had
led
to
it
her
going
to
the
house
she
remembered
now
it
was
the
first
door
at
which
she
had
knocked
her
footsteps
had
surely
been
directed
her
meeting
with
phillips
in
madge
rooms
and
that
invitation
to
dinner
coinciding
with
that
crisis
in
his
life
it
was
she
who
had
persuaded
him
to
accept
but
for
her
he
would
have
doubted
wavered
let
his
opportunities
slip
by
he
had
confessed
it
to
her
and
she
had
promised
him
he
needed
her
the
words
she
had
spoken
to
madge
not
dreaming
then
of
their
swift
application
they
came
back
to
her
god
has
called
me
he
girded
his
sword
upon
me
what
right
had
she
to
leave
it
rusting
in
its
scabbard
turning
aside
from
the
pathway
pointed
out
to
her
because
of
one
weak
useless
life
crouching
in
her
way
it
was
not
as
if
she
were
being
asked
to
do
evil
herself
that
good
might
come
the
decision
had
been
taken
out
of
her
hands
all
she
had
to
do
was
to
remain
quiescent
not
interfering
awaiting
her
orders
her
business
was
with
her
own
part
not
with
another
to
be
willing
to
sacrifice
oneself
that
was
at
the
root
of
all
service
sometimes
it
was
one
own
duty
sometimes
that
of
another
must
one
never
go
forward
because
another
steps
out
of
one
way
voluntarily
besides
she
might
have
been
mistaken
that
picture
ever
before
her
of
the
woman
pausing
with
the
brush
above
her
tongue
that
little
stilled
gasp
it
may
have
been
but
a
phantasm
born
of
her
own
fevered
imagination
she
clung
to
that
desperately
it
was
the
task
that
had
been
entrusted
to
her
how
could
he
hope
to
succeed
without
her
with
her
he
would
be
all
powerful
accomplish
the
end
for
which
he
had
been
sent
into
the
world
society
counts
for
so
much
in
england
what
public
man
had
ever
won
through
without
its
assistance
as
greyson
had
said
it
is
the
that
rules
she
could
win
it
over
to
his
side
that
mission
to
paris
that
she
had
undertaken
for
denton
that
had
brought
her
into
contact
with
diplomatists
politicians
the
leaders
and
the
rulers
the
bearers
of
names
known
and
honoured
in
history
they
had
accepted
her
as
one
of
themselves
she
had
influenced
them
swayed
them
that
afternoon
at
folk
studio
where
all
eyes
had
followed
her
where
famous
men
and
women
had
waited
to
attract
her
notice
had
hung
upon
her
words
even
at
school
at
college
she
had
always
commanded
willing
homage
as
greyson
had
once
told
her
it
was
herself
her
personality
that
was
her
greatest
asset
was
it
to
be
utterly
wasted
there
were
hundreds
of
impersonal
sexless
women
equipped
for
nothing
else
with
pens
as
keen
if
not
keener
than
hers
that
was
not
the
talent
with
which
she
had
been
entrusted
for
which
she
would
have
to
account
it
was
her
beauty
her
power
to
charm
to
draw
after
her
to
compel
by
the
mere
exercise
of
her
will
hitherto
beauty
had
been
content
to
barter
itself
for
mere
coin
of
the
realm
for
ease
and
luxury
and
pleasure
she
only
asked
to
be
allowed
to
spend
it
in
service
as
his
wife
she
could
use
it
to
fine
ends
by
herself
she
was
helpless
one
must
take
the
world
as
one
finds
it
it
gives
the
unmated
woman
no
opportunity
to
employ
the
special
gifts
with
which
god
has
endowed
her
except
for
evil
as
the
wife
of
a
rising
statesman
she
could
be
a
force
for
progress
she
could
become
another
madame
roland
gather
round
her
all
that
was
best
of
english
social
life
give
back
to
it
its
lost
position
in
the
vanguard
of
thought
she
could
strengthen
him
give
him
courage
without
her
he
would
always
remain
the
mere
fighter
doubtful
of
himself
the
confidence
the
inspiration
necessary
for
leadership
she
alone
could
bring
to
him
each
by
themselves
was
incomplete
together
they
would
be
the
whole
they
would
build
the
city
of
their
dreams
she
seemed
to
have
become
a
wandering
spirit
rather
than
a
living
being
she
had
no
sense
of
time
or
place
once
she
had
started
hearing
herself
laugh
she
was
seated
at
a
table
and
was
talking
and
then
she
had
passed
back
into
forgetfulness
now
from
somewhere
she
was
gazing
downward
roofs
domes
and
towers
lay
stretched
before
her
emerging
from
a
sea
of
shadows
she
held
out
her
arms
towards
them
and
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
the
poor
tired
people
were
calling
to
her
to
join
with
him
to
help
them
should
she
fail
them
turn
deaf
ears
to
the
myriad
because
of
pity
for
one
useless
feeble
life
she
had
been
fashioned
to
be
his
helpmate
as
surely
as
if
she
had
been
made
of
the
same
bone
nature
was
at
one
with
god
spirit
and
body
both
yearned
for
him
it
was
not
position
power
for
herself
that
she
craved
the
marriage
market
if
that
had
been
her
desire
it
had
always
been
open
to
her
she
had
the
gold
that
buys
these
things
wealth
ambition
they
had
been
offered
to
her
spread
out
temptingly
before
her
eyes
they
were
always
within
her
means
if
ever
she
chose
to
purchase
them
it
was
this
man
alone
to
whom
she
had
ever
felt
drawn
this
man
of
the
people
with
that
suggestion
about
him
of
something
primitive
untamed
causing
her
always
in
his
presence
that
faint
compelling
thrill
of
fear
who
stirred
her
blood
as
none
of
the
polished
men
of
her
own
class
had
ever
done
his
kind
strong
ugly
face
it
moved
beside
her
its
fearless
tender
eyes
now
pleading
now
commanding
he
needed
her
she
heard
his
passionate
low
voice
as
she
had
heard
it
in
the
little
garden
above
meudon
because
you
wo
be
there
and
without
you
i
can
do
nothing
what
right
had
this
poor
shadow
to
stand
between
them
to
the
end
had
love
and
life
no
claims
but
only
weakness
she
had
taken
all
had
given
nothing
it
was
but
reparation
she
was
making
why
stop
her
she
was
alone
in
a
maze
of
narrow
silent
streets
that
ended
always
in
a
high
blank
wall
it
seemed
impossible
to
get
away
from
this
blank
wall
whatever
way
she
turned
she
was
always
coming
back
to
it
what
was
she
to
do
drag
the
woman
back
to
life
against
her
will
lead
her
back
to
him
to
be
a
chain
about
his
feet
until
the
end
then
leave
him
to
fight
the
battle
alone
and
herself
all
her
world
had
been
watching
and
would
know
she
had
counted
her
chickens
before
they
were
dead
she
had
set
her
cap
at
the
man
reckoning
him
already
widowed
and
his
wife
had
come
to
life
and
snatched
it
from
her
head
she
could
hear
the
laughter
the
half
amused
half
contemptuous
pity
for
her
rotten
bad
luck
she
would
be
their
standing
jest
till
she
was
forgotten
what
would
life
leave
to
her
a
lonely
lodging
and
a
pot
of
ink
that
she
would
come
to
hate
the
smell
of
she
could
never
marry
it
would
be
but
her
body
that
she
could
give
to
any
other
man
not
even
for
the
sake
of
her
dreams
could
she
bring
herself
to
that
it
might
have
been
possible
before
but
not
now
she
could
have
won
the
victory
over
herself
but
for
hope
that
had
kindled
the
smouldering
embers
of
her
passion
into
flame
what
cunning
devil
had
flung
open
this
door
showing
her
all
her
heart
desire
merely
that
she
should
be
called
upon
to
slam
it
to
in
her
own
face
a
fierce
anger
blazed
up
in
her
brain
why
should
she
listen
why
had
reason
been
given
to
us
if
we
were
not
to
use
it
weigh
good
and
evil
in
the
balance
and
decide
for
ourselves
where
lay
the
nobler
gain
were
we
to
be
led
hither
and
thither
like
blind
children
what
was
right
what
wrong
but
what
our
own
judgment
told
us
was
it
wrong
of
the
woman
to
perform
this
act
of
yielding
up
all
things
to
love
no
it
was
great
heroic
of
her
it
would
be
her
cross
of
victory
her
crown
if
the
gift
were
noble
so
also
it
could
not
be
ignoble
to
accept
it
to
reject
it
would
be
to
dishonour
it
she
would
accept
it
the
wonder
of
it
should
cast
out
her
doubts
and
fears
she
would
seek
to
make
herself
worthy
of
it
consecrate
it
with
her
steadfastness
her
devotion
she
thought
it
ended
but
yet
she
sat
there
motionless
what
was
plucking
at
her
sleeve
still
holding
her
unknowing
she
had
entered
a
small
garden
it
formed
a
passage
between
two
streets
and
was
left
open
day
and
night
it
was
but
a
narrow
strip
of
rank
grass
and
withered
shrubs
with
an
asphalte
pathway
widening
to
a
circle
in
the
centre
where
stood
a
gas
lamp
and
two
seats
facing
one
another
and
suddenly
it
came
to
her
that
this
was
her
garden
of
gethsemane
and
a
dull
laugh
broke
from
her
that
she
could
not
help
it
was
such
a
ridiculous
apology
for
gethsemane
there
was
not
a
corner
in
which
one
could
possibly
pray
only
these
two
iron
seats
one
each
side
of
the
gaunt
gas
lamp
that
glared
down
upon
them
even
the
withered
shrubs
were
fenced
off
behind
a
railing
a
ragged
figure
sprawled
upon
the
bench
opposite
to
her
it
snored
gently
and
its
breath
came
laden
with
the
odour
of
cheap
whisky
but
it
was
her
gethsemane
the
best
that
fate
had
been
able
to
do
for
her
it
was
here
that
her
choice
would
be
made
she
felt
that
and
there
rose
before
her
the
vision
of
that
other
garden
of
gethsemane
with
below
it
the
soft
lights
of
the
city
shining
through
the
trees
and
above
clear
against
the
starlit
sky
the
cold
dark
cross
it
was
only
a
little
cross
hers
by
comparison
she
could
see
that
they
seemed
to
be
standing
side
by
side
but
then
she
was
only
a
woman
little
more
than
a
girl
and
her
courage
was
so
small
she
thought
he
ought
to
know
that
for
her
it
was
quite
a
big
cross
she
wondered
if
he
had
been
listening
to
all
her
arguments
there
was
really
a
good
deal
of
sense
in
some
of
them
perhaps
he
would
understand
not
all
his
prayer
had
come
down
to
us
he
too
had
put
up
a
fight
for
life
he
too
was
young
for
him
also
life
must
have
seemed
but
just
beginning
perhaps
he
too
had
felt
that
his
duty
still
lay
among
the
people
teaching
guiding
healing
them
to
him
too
life
must
have
been
sweet
with
its
noble
work
its
loving
comradeship
even
from
him
the
words
had
to
be
wrung
thy
will
not
mine
be
done
she
whispered
them
at
last
not
bravely
at
all
feebly
haltingly
with
a
little
sob
her
forehead
pressed
against
the
cold
iron
seat
as
if
that
could
help
her
she
thought
that
even
then
god
might
reconsider
it
see
her
point
of
view
perhaps
he
would
send
her
a
sign
the
ragged
figure
on
the
bench
opposite
opened
its
eyes
stared
at
her
then
went
to
sleep
again
a
prowling
cat
paused
to
rub
itself
against
her
foot
but
meeting
no
response
passed
on
through
an
open
window
somewhere
near
filtered
the
sound
of
a
child
low
whimpering
it
was
daylight
when
she
awoke
she
was
cold
and
her
limbs
ached
slowly
her
senses
came
back
to
her
the
seat
opposite
was
vacant
the
gas
lamp
showed
but
a
faint
blue
point
of
flame
her
dress
was
torn
her
boots
soiled
and
muddy
strands
of
her
hair
had
escaped
from
underneath
her
hat
she
looked
at
her
watch
fortunately
it
was
still
early
she
would
be
able
to
let
herself
in
before
anyone
was
up
it
was
but
a
little
way
she
wondered
while
rearranging
her
hair
what
day
it
was
she
would
find
out
when
she
got
home
from
the
newspaper
in
the
street
she
paused
a
moment
and
looked
back
through
the
railings
it
seemed
even
still
more
sordid
in
the
daylight
the
sooty
grass
and
the
withered
shrubs
and
the
asphalte
pathway
strewn
with
dirty
paper
and
again
a
laugh
she
could
not
help
broke
from
her
her
garden
of
gethsemane
she
sent
a
brief
letter
round
to
phillips
and
a
telegram
to
the
nurse
preparing
them
for
what
she
meant
to
do
she
had
just
time
to
pack
a
small
trunk
and
catch
the
morning
train
at
folkestone
she
drove
first
to
a
house
where
she
herself
had
once
lodged
and
fixed
things
to
her
satisfaction
the
nurse
was
waiting
for
her
in
the
downstairs
room
and
opened
the
door
to
her
she
was
opposed
to
joan
interference
but
joan
had
come
prepared
for
that
let
me
have
a
talk
with
her
she
said
i
think
i
found
out
what
it
is
that
is
causing
all
the
trouble
the
nurse
shot
her
a
swift
glance
i
glad
of
that
she
said
dryly
she
let
joan
go
upstairs
phillips
was
asleep
joan
seated
herself
beside
the
bed
and
waited
she
had
not
yet
made
herself
up
for
the
day
and
the
dyed
hair
was
hidden
beneath
a
white
cap
the
pale
thin
face
with
its
closed
eyes
looked
strangely
young
suddenly
the
thin
hands
clasped
and
her
lips
moved
as
if
she
were
praying
in
her
sleep
perhaps
she
also
was
dreaming
of
gethsemane
it
must
be
quite
a
crowded
garden
if
only
we
could
see
it
after
a
while
her
eyes
opened
joan
drew
her
chair
nearer
and
slipped
her
arm
in
under
her
and
their
eyes
met
you
not
playing
the
game
whispered
joan
shaking
her
head
i
only
promised
on
condition
that
you
would
try
to
get
well
the
woman
made
no
attempt
to
deny
something
told
her
that
joan
had
learned
her
secret
she
glanced
towards
the
door
joan
had
closed
it
do
drag
me
back
she
whispered
it
all
finished
she
raised
herself
up
and
put
her
arms
about
joan
neck
it
was
hard
at
first
and
i
hated
you
and
then
it
came
to
me
that
this
was
what
i
had
been
wanting
to
do
all
my
life
something
to
help
him
that
nobody
else
could
do
do
take
it
from
me
i
know
whispered
joan
i
been
there
too
i
knew
you
were
doing
it
though
i
did
quite
know
how
till
the
other
day
i
think
i
wanted
to
pretend
that
i
did
i
know
all
you
can
say
been
listening
to
it
it
was
right
of
you
to
want
to
give
it
all
up
to
me
for
his
sake
but
it
would
be
wrong
of
me
to
take
it
i
do
quite
see
why
i
ca
explain
it
but
i
must
so
you
see
it
would
be
no
good
but
i
so
useless
pleaded
the
woman
i
said
that
answered
joan
i
wanted
to
do
it
and
i
talked
and
talked
so
hard
i
said
everything
i
could
think
of
but
that
was
the
only
answer
i
must
do
it
they
remained
for
a
while
with
their
arms
round
one
another
it
struck
joan
as
curious
even
at
the
time
that
all
feeling
of
superiority
had
gone
out
of
her
they
might
have
been
two
puzzled
children
that
had
met
one
another
on
a
path
that
neither
knew
but
joan
was
the
stronger
character
i
want
you
to
give
me
up
that
box
she
said
and
to
come
away
with
me
where
i
can
be
with
you
and
take
care
of
you
until
you
are
well
phillips
made
yet
another
effort
have
you
thought
about
him
she
asked
joan
answered
with
a
faint
smile
oh
yes
she
said
i
did
forget
that
argument
in
case
it
had
occurred
to
the
lord
perhaps
she
added
the
helpmate
theory
was
intended
to
apply
only
to
our
bodies
there
was
nothing
said
about
our
souls
perhaps
god
have
to
work
in
pairs
perhaps
we
were
meant
to
stand
alone
phillips
thin
hands
were
playing
nervously
with
the
bed
clothes
there
still
seemed
something
that
she
had
to
say
as
if
joan
thought
of
everything
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
narrow
strip
of
light
between
the
window
curtains
you
do
think
you
could
dear
she
whispered
if
i
did
do
anything
wicked
any
more
but
just
let
things
take
their
course
you
see
dear
she
went
on
her
face
still
turned
away
i
thought
it
all
finished
it
will
be
hard
for
me
to
go
back
to
him
knowing
as
i
do
now
that
he
does
want
me
i
shall
always
feel
that
i
am
in
his
way
and
hilda
she
added
after
a
pause
she
will
hate
me
joan
looked
at
the
white
patient
face
and
was
silent
what
would
be
the
use
of
senseless
contradiction
the
woman
knew
it
would
only
seem
an
added
stab
of
mockery
she
knelt
beside
the
bed
and
took
the
thin
hands
in
hers
i
think
god
must
want
you
very
badly
she
said
or
he
would
have
laid
so
heavy
a
cross
upon
you
you
will
come
the
woman
did
not
answer
in
words
the
big
tears
were
rolling
down
her
cheeks
there
was
no
paint
to
mingle
with
and
mar
them
she
drew
the
little
metal
box
from
under
the
pillow
and
gave
it
into
joan
hands
joan
crept
out
softly
from
the
room
the
nurse
was
standing
by
the
window
she
turned
sharply
on
entrance
joan
slipped
the
box
into
her
hands
the
nurse
raised
the
lid
what
a
fool
i
been
she
said
i
never
thought
of
that
she
held
out
a
large
strong
hand
and
gave
joan
a
longish
grip
right
she
said
we
must
get
her
out
of
this
house
at
once
forgive
me
phillips
had
been
called
up
north
and
wired
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
get
down
till
the
wednesday
evening
joan
met
him
at
the
station
she
wo
be
expecting
you
just
yet
she
explained
we
might
have
a
little
walk
she
waited
till
they
had
reached
a
quiet
road
leading
to
the
hills
you
will
find
her
changed
she
said
mentally
i
mean
though
she
will
try
not
to
show
it
she
was
dying
for
your
sake
to
set
you
free
hilda
seems
to
have
had
a
talk
with
her
and
to
have
spared
her
no
part
of
the
truth
her
great
love
for
you
made
the
sacrifice
possible
and
even
welcome
it
was
the
one
gift
she
had
in
her
hands
she
was
giving
it
gladly
proudly
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
it
would
have
been
kinder
to
let
her
make
an
end
of
it
but
during
the
last
few
days
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
there
is
a
law
within
us
that
we
may
not
argue
with
she
is
coming
back
to
life
knowing
you
no
longer
want
her
that
she
is
only
in
the
way
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
think
of
something
to
say
or
do
that
will
lessen
her
martyrdom
i
ca
they
had
paused
where
a
group
of
trees
threw
a
blot
of
shadow
across
the
moonlit
road
you
mean
she
was
killing
herself
he
asked
quite
cleverly
so
as
to
avoid
all
danger
of
after
discovery
that
might
have
hurt
us
she
answered
they
walked
in
silence
and
coming
to
a
road
that
led
back
into
the
town
he
turned
down
it
she
had
the
feeling
she
was
following
him
without
his
knowing
it
a
cab
was
standing
outside
the
gate
of
a
house
having
just
discharged
its
fare
he
seemed
to
have
suddenly
recollected
her
do
you
mind
he
said
we
shall
get
there
so
much
quicker
you
go
she
said
i
stroll
on
quietly
you
sure
he
said
i
would
rather
she
answered
it
struck
her
that
he
was
relieved
he
gave
the
man
the
address
speaking
hurriedly
and
jumped
in
she
had
gone
on
she
heard
the
closing
of
the
door
behind
her
and
the
next
moment
the
cab
passed
her
she
did
not
see
him
again
that
night
they
met
in
the
morning
at
breakfast
a
curious
strangeness
to
each
other
seemed
to
have
grown
up
between
them
as
if
they
had
known
one
another
long
ago
and
had
half
forgotten
when
they
had
finished
she
rose
to
leave
but
he
asked
her
to
stop
and
after
the
table
had
been
cleared
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
while
she
sat
sideways
on
the
window
seat
from
where
she
could
watch
the
little
ships
moving
to
and
fro
across
the
horizon
like
painted
figures
in
a
show
i
had
a
long
talk
with
nan
last
night
he
said
and
trying
to
explain
it
to
her
i
came
a
little
nearer
to
understanding
it
myself
my
love
for
you
would
have
been
strong
enough
to
ruin
both
of
us
i
see
that
now
it
would
have
dominated
every
other
thought
in
me
it
would
have
swallowed
up
my
dreams
it
would
have
been
blind
unscrupulous
married
to
you
i
should
have
aimed
only
at
success
it
would
not
have
been
your
fault
you
would
not
have
known
about
mere
birth
i
should
never
have
troubled
myself
i
met
daughters
of
a
hundred
earls
more
or
less
clever
jolly
little
women
i
could
have
chucked
under
the
chin
and
have
been
chummy
with
nature
creates
her
own
ranks
and
puts
her
ban
upon
misalliances
every
time
i
took
you
in
my
arms
i
should
have
felt
that
you
had
stepped
down
from
your
proper
order
to
mate
yourself
with
me
and
that
it
was
up
to
me
to
make
the
sacrifice
good
to
you
by
giving
you
power
position
already
within
the
last
few
weeks
when
it
looked
as
if
this
thing
was
going
to
be
possible
i
have
been
thinking
against
my
will
of
a
compromise
with
carleton
that
would
give
me
his
support
this
coming
election
was
beginning
to
have
terrors
for
me
that
i
have
never
before
felt
the
thought
of
defeat
having
to
go
back
to
comparative
poverty
to
comparative
obscurity
with
you
as
my
wife
was
growing
into
a
nightmare
i
should
have
wanted
wealth
fame
victory
for
your
sake
to
see
you
honoured
courted
envied
finely
dressed
and
finely
housed
grateful
to
me
for
having
won
for
you
these
things
it
was
honest
healthy
love
the
love
that
unites
that
makes
a
man
willing
to
take
as
well
as
to
give
that
i
felt
for
you
it
was
worship
that
separates
a
man
from
a
woman
that
puts
fear
between
them
it
good
that
man
should
worship
a
woman
he
ca
serve
god
and
woman
their
interests
are
liable
to
clash
nan
my
helpmate
just
a
loving
woman
that
the
lord
brought
to
me
and
gave
me
when
i
was
alone
that
i
still
love
i
did
know
it
till
last
night
she
will
never
stand
in
my
way
i
have
to
put
her
against
my
duty
she
will
leave
me
free
to
obey
the
voice
that
calls
to
me
and
no
man
can
hear
that
voice
but
himself
he
had
been
speaking
in
a
clear
tone
as
if
at
last
he
saw
his
road
before
him
to
the
end
and
felt
that
nothing
else
mattered
but
that
he
should
go
forward
hopefully
unfalteringly
now
he
paused
and
his
eyes
wandered
but
the
lines
about
his
strong
mouth
deepened
perhaps
i
am
not
of
the
stuff
that
conquerors
are
made
he
went
on
perhaps
if
i
were
i
should
be
thinking
differently
it
comes
to
me
sometimes
that
i
may
be
one
of
those
intended
only
to
prepare
the
way
that
for
me
there
may
be
only
the
endless
struggle
i
may
have
to
face
unpopularity
abuse
failure
she
wo
mind
nor
would
you
he
added
turning
to
her
suddenly
for
the
first
time
i
know
that
but
i
should
be
afraid
for
you
she
had
listened
to
him
without
interrupting
and
even
now
she
did
not
speak
for
a
while
it
was
hard
not
to
she
wanted
to
tell
him
that
he
was
all
wrong
at
least
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
it
was
not
the
conqueror
she
loved
in
him
it
was
the
fighter
not
in
the
hour
of
triumph
but
in
the
hour
of
despair
she
would
have
yearned
to
put
her
arms
about
him
unpopularity
abuse
failure
it
was
against
the
fear
of
such
that
she
would
have
guarded
him
yes
she
had
dreamed
of
leadership
influence
command
but
it
was
the
leadership
of
the
valiant
few
against
the
hosts
of
the
oppressors
that
she
claimed
wealth
honours
would
she
have
given
up
a
life
of
ease
shut
herself
off
from
society
if
these
had
been
her
standards
had
the
male
animal
no
instinct
telling
it
when
it
was
loved
with
all
a
woman
being
so
that
any
other
union
would
be
her
degradation
it
was
better
for
him
he
should
think
as
he
did
she
rose
and
held
out
her
hand
i
will
stay
with
her
for
a
little
while
she
said
till
i
feel
there
is
no
more
need
then
i
must
get
back
to
work
he
looked
into
her
eyes
holding
her
hand
and
she
felt
his
body
trembling
she
knew
he
was
about
to
speak
and
held
up
a
warning
hand
that
all
my
lad
she
said
with
a
smile
my
love
to
you
and
god
speed
you
phillips
progressed
slowly
but
steadily
life
was
returning
to
her
but
it
was
not
the
same
out
of
those
days
there
had
come
to
her
a
gentle
dignity
a
strengthening
and
refining
the
face
now
pale
and
drawn
had
lost
its
foolishness
under
the
thin
white
hair
and
in
spite
of
its
deep
lines
it
had
grown
younger
a
great
patience
a
like
thoughtfulness
had
come
into
the
quiet
eyes
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
her
hands
folded
joan
had
been
reading
to
her
and
the
chapter
finished
she
had
closed
the
book
and
her
thoughts
had
been
wandering
phillips
voice
recalled
them
do
you
remember
that
day
my
dear
she
said
when
we
went
furnishing
together
and
i
would
have
all
the
wrong
things
and
you
let
me
yes
answered
joan
with
a
laugh
they
were
pretty
awful
some
of
them
i
was
just
wondering
she
went
on
it
was
a
pity
was
it
i
was
silly
and
began
to
cry
i
expect
that
was
it
joan
confessed
it
interferes
with
our
reason
at
times
it
was
only
a
little
thing
of
course
that
she
answered
but
been
thinking
it
must
be
that
that
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
and
that
is
why
god
lets
there
be
weak
things
children
and
little
animals
and
men
and
women
in
pain
that
we
feel
sorry
for
so
that
people
like
you
and
robert
and
so
many
others
are
willing
to
give
up
all
your
lives
to
helping
them
and
that
is
what
he
wants
perhaps
god
can
not
help
there
being
weak
things
answered
joan
perhaps
he
too
is
sorry
for
them
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
does
it
dear
she
answered
they
are
there
anyhow
and
that
is
how
he
knows
those
who
are
willing
to
serve
him
by
their
being
pitiful
they
fell
into
a
silence
joan
found
herself
dreaming
yes
it
was
true
it
must
have
been
the
beginning
of
all
things
man
pitiless
deaf
blind
groping
in
the
darkness
knowing
not
even
himself
and
to
her
vision
far
off
out
of
the
mist
he
shaped
himself
before
her
that
dim
first
of
the
lord
the
man
who
first
felt
pity
savage
brutish
dumb
lonely
there
amid
the
desolation
staring
down
at
some
hurt
creature
man
or
beast
it
mattered
not
his
dull
eyes
troubled
with
a
strange
new
pain
he
understood
not
and
suddenly
as
he
stooped
there
must
have
come
a
great
light
into
his
eyes
man
had
heard
god
voice
across
the
deep
and
had
made
answer
chapter
xv
the
years
that
followed
till
like
some
shipwrecked
swimmer
to
whom
returning
light
reveals
the
land
she
felt
new
life
and
hopes
come
back
to
her
always
remained
in
her
memory
vague
confused
a
jumble
of
events
thoughts
feelings
without
sequence
or
connection
she
had
gone
down
to
liverpool
intending
to
persuade
her
father
to
leave
the
control
of
the
works
to
arthur
and
to
come
and
live
with
her
in
london
but
had
left
without
broaching
the
subject
there
were
nights
when
she
would
trapse
the
streets
till
she
would
almost
fall
exhausted
rather
than
face
the
solitude
awaiting
her
in
her
own
rooms
but
so
also
there
were
moods
when
like
some
stricken
animal
her
instinct
was
to
shun
all
living
things
at
such
times
his
presence
for
all
his
loving
patience
would
have
been
as
a
knife
in
her
wound
besides
he
would
always
be
there
when
escape
from
herself
for
a
while
became
an
absolute
necessity
more
and
more
she
had
come
to
regard
him
as
her
comforter
not
from
anything
he
ever
said
or
did
rather
it
seemed
to
her
because
that
with
him
she
felt
no
need
of
words
the
works
since
arthur
had
shared
the
management
had
gradually
been
regaining
their
position
and
he
had
urged
her
to
let
him
increase
her
allowance
it
will
give
you
greater
freedom
he
had
suggested
with
fine
assumption
of
propounding
a
mere
business
proposition
enabling
you
to
choose
your
work
entirely
for
its
own
sake

have
always
wanted
to
take
a
hand
in
helping
things
on
it
will
come
to
just
the
same
your
doing
it
for
me
she
had
suppressed
a
smile
and
had
accepted
thanks
dad
she
had
answered
it
will
be
nice
having
you
as
my
backer
her
admiration
of
the
independent
woman
had
undergone
some
modification
since
she
had
come
in
contact
with
her
woman
was
intended
to
be
dependent
upon
man
it
was
the
part
appointed
to
him
in
the
social
scheme
woman
had
hers
no
less
important
earning
her
own
living
did
not
improve
her
it
was
one
of
the
drawbacks
of
civilization
that
so
many
had
to
do
it
of
necessity
it
developed
her
on
the
wrong
lines
against
her
nature
this
cry
of
the
unsexed
that
woman
must
always
be
the
paid
servant
instead
of
the
helper
of
man
paid
for
being
mother
paid
for
being
wife
why
not
carry
it
to
its
logical
conclusion
and
insist
that
she
should
be
paid
for
her
embraces
that
she
should
share
in
man
labour
in
his
hopes
that
was
the
true
comradeship
what
mattered
it
who
held
the
her
room
was
always
kept
ready
for
her
often
she
would
lie
there
watching
the
moonlight
creep
across
the
floor
and
a
curious
feeling
would
come
to
her
of
being
something
wandering
incomplete
she
would
see
as
through
a
mist
the
passionate
restless
child
with
the
rebellious
eyes
to
whom
the
room
had
once
belonged
and
later
the
strangely
possessed
girl
with
that
impalpable
veil
of
mystery
around
her
who
would
stand
with
folded
hands
there
by
the
window
seeming
always
to
be
listening
and
she
too
had
passed
away
the
tears
would
come
into
her
eyes
and
she
would
stretch
out
yearning
arms
towards
their
shadowy
forms
but
they
would
only
turn
upon
her
eyes
that
saw
not
and
would
fade
away
in
the
when
arthur
and
her
father
were
at
the
works
she
would
move
through
the
high
square
rooms
or
about
the
great
formal
garden
with
its
ordered
walks
and
level
lawns
and
as
with
knowledge
we
come
to
love
some
old
stern
face
our
childish
eyes
had
thought
forbidding
and
would
not
have
it
changed
there
came
to
her
with
the
years
a
growing
fondness
for
the
old
plain
house
generations
of
allways
had
lived
and
died
there
men
and
women
somewhat
narrow
unsympathetic
a
little
hard
of
understanding
but
at
least
earnest
sincere
seeking
to
do
their
duty
in
their
solid
unimaginative
way
perhaps
there
were
other
ways
besides
those
of
speech
and
pen
perhaps
one
did
better
keeping
to
one
own
people
the
very
qualities
that
separated
us
from
them
being
intended
for
their
need
what
mattered
the
colours
so
that
one
followed
the
flag
somewhere
all
roads
would
meet
arthur
had
to
be
in
london
generally
once
or
twice
a
month
and
it
came
to
be
accepted
that
he
should
always
call
upon
her
and
take
her
out
she
had
lost
the
that
had
made
roaming
about
london
by
herself
a
pleasurable
adventure
and
a
fear
of
what
people
were
saying
and
thinking
about
her
made
her
shy
even
of
the
few
friends
she
still
clung
to
so
that
his
visits
grew
to
be
of
the
nature
of
childish
treats
to
which
she
found
herself
looking
forward
counting
the
days
also
she
came
to
be
dependent
upon
him
for
the
keeping
alight
within
her
of
that
little
kindly
fire
of
at
which
we
warm
our
hands
in
wintry
days
it
is
not
good
that
a
young
woman
should
remain
for
long
a
stranger
to
her
mirror
above
her
frocks
indifferent
to
the
angle
of
her
hat
she
had
met
the
women
superior
to
feminine
vanities
handsome
enough
some
of
them
must
once
have
been
now
sunk
in
slovenliness
uncleanliness
in
disrespect
to
womanhood
it
would
not
be
fair
to
him
the
worshipper
has
his
rights
the
goddess
must
remember
always
that
she
is
a
goddess
must
pull
herself
together
and
behave
as
such
appearing
upon
her
pedestal
becomingly
attired
seeing
to
it
that
in
all
things
she
is
at
her
best
not
allowing
private
grief
to
render
her
neglectful
of
this
duty
she
had
not
told
him
of
the
phillips
episode
but
she
felt
instinctively
that
he
knew
it
was
always
a
little
mysterious
to
her
his
perception
in
matters
pertaining
to
herself
i
want
your
love
she
said
to
him
one
day
it
helps
me
i
used
to
think
it
was
selfish
of
me
to
take
it
knowing
i
could
never
return
it
not
that
love
but
i
no
longer
feel
that
now
your
love
seems
to
me
a
fountain
from
which
i
can
drink
without
hurting
you
i
should
love
to
be
with
you
always
he
answered
if
you
wished
it
you
wo
forget
your
promise
she
remembered
it
then
no
she
answered
with
a
smile
i
shall
keep
watch
perhaps
i
shall
be
worthy
of
it
by
that
time
she
had
lost
her
faith
in
journalism
as
a
drum
for
the
rousing
of
the
people
against
wrong
its
beat
had
led
too
often
to
the
booth
to
the
rostrum
it
had
lost
its
rallying
power
the
popular
press
had
made
the
newspaper
a
byword
for
falsehood
even
its
supporters
while
reading
it
because
it
pandered
to
their
passions
tickled
their
vices
and
flattered
their
ignorance
despised
and
disbelieved
it
here
and
there
an
honest
journal
advocated
a
reform
pleaded
for
the
sweeping
away
of
an
injustice
the
public
shrugged
its
shoulders
another
newspaper
stunt
a
bid
for
popularity
for
notoriety
with
its
consequent
financial
kudos
she
still
continued
to
write
for
greyson
but
felt
she
was
labouring
for
the
doomed
lord
sutcliffe
had
died
suddenly
and
his
holding
in
the
had
passed
to
his
nephew
a
gentleman
more
interested
in
big
game
shooting
than
in
politics
greyson
support
of
phillips
had
brought
him
within
the
net
of
carleton
operations
and
negotiations
for
purchase
had
already
been
commenced
she
knew
that
sooner
or
later
greyson
would
be
offered
the
alternative
of
either
changing
his
opinions
or
of
going
and
she
knew
that
he
would
go
her
work
for
denton
was
less
likely
to
be
interfered
with
it
appealed
only
to
the
few
and
aimed
at
informing
and
explaining
rather
than
directly
converting
useful
enough
work
in
its
way
no
doubt
but
to
put
heart
into
it
seemed
to
require
longer
views
than
is
given
to
the
eyes
of
youth
besides
her
pen
was
no
longer
able
to
absorb
her
attention
to
keep
her
mind
from
wandering
the
solitude
of
her
desk
gave
her
the
feeling
of
a
prison
her
body
made
perpetual
claims
upon
her
as
though
it
were
some
restless
fretful
child
dragging
her
out
into
the
streets
without
knowing
where
it
wanted
to
go
discontented
with
everything
it
did
then
hurrying
her
back
to
fling
itself
upon
a
chair
weary
but
still
dissatisfied
if
only
she
could
do
something
she
was
sick
of
thinking
these
physical
activities
into
which
women
were
throwing
themselves
where
one
used
one
body
as
well
as
one
brain
hastened
to
appointments
gathered
round
noisy
tables
met
fellow
human
beings
argued
with
them
walked
with
them
laughing
and
talking
forced
way
through
crowds
cheered
shouted
stood
up
on
platforms
before
a
sea
of
faces
roused
applause
filling
and
emptying
one
lungs
met
interruptions
with
swift
flash
of
wit
or
anger
faced
opposition
danger
felt
one
blood
surging
through
one
veins
felt
one
nerves
quivering
with
excitement
felt
the
delirious
thrill
of
passion
felt
the
mad
joy
of
the
loosened
animal
she
threw
herself
into
the
suffrage
movement
it
satisfied
her
for
a
while
she
had
the
rare
gift
of
public
speaking
and
enjoyed
her
triumphs
she
was
temperate
reasonable
persuasive
rather
than
aggressive
feeling
her
audience
as
she
went
never
losing
touch
with
them
she
had
the
magnetism
that
comes
of
sympathy
medical
students
who
came
intending
to
tell
her
to
go
home
and
mind
the
baby
remained
to
wonder
if
man
really
was
the
undoubted
sovereign
of
the
world
born
to
look
upon
woman
as
his
willing
subject
to
wonder
whether
under
some
unwritten
whispered
law
it
might
not
be
the
other
way
about
perhaps
she
had
the
right
with
or
without
the
baby
to
move
about
the
kingdom
express
her
wishes
for
its
care
and
management
possibly
his
doubts
may
not
have
been
brought
about
solely
by
the
force
and
logic
of
her
arguments
possibly
the
voice
of
nature
is
not
altogether
out
of
place
in
discussions
upon
humanity
affairs
she
wanted
votes
for
women
but
she
wanted
them
clean
won
without
dishonour
these
monkey
tricks
this
apish
fury
and
impatience
suppose
it
did
hasten
by
a
few
months
more
or
less
the
coming
of
the
inevitable
suppose
by
unlawful
methods
one
could
succeed
in
dragging
a
reform
a
little
prematurely
from
the
womb
of
time
did
not
one
endanger
the
child
health
of
what
value
was
woman
influence
on
public
affairs
going
to
be
if
she
was
to
boast
that
she
had
won
the
right
to
exercise
it
by
unscrupulousness
and
brutality
they
were
to
be
found
at
every
corner
the
reformers
who
could
not
reform
themselves
the
believers
in
universal
brotherhood
who
hated
half
the
people
the
denouncers
of
tyranny
demanding
for
their
opponents
the
bloodthirsty
preachers
of
peace
the
moralists
who
had
persuaded
themselves
that
every
wrong
was
justified
provided
one
were
fighting
for
the
right
the
deaf
shouters
for
justice
the
excellent
intentioned
men
and
women
labouring
for
reforms
that
could
only
be
hoped
for
when
greed
and
prejudice
had
yielded
place
to
reason
and
who
sought
to
bring
about
their
ends
by
appeals
to
passion
and
and
the
insincere
the
the
those
who
were
in
the
business
for
even
coarser
profit
the
lovers
who
would
always
say
and
do
the
clever
the
unexpected
thing
rather
than
the
useful
and
the
helpful
thing
to
whom
paradox
was
more
than
principle
ought
there
not
to
be
a
school
for
reformers
a
training
college
where
could
be
inculcated
patience
temperance
subordination
to
duty
with
lectures
on
the
fundamental
laws
within
which
all
progress
must
be
accomplished
outside
which
lay
confusion
and
explosions
with
lectures
on
history
showing
how
improvements
had
been
brought
about
and
how
failure
had
been
invited
thus
avoiding
much
waste
of
reforming
zeal
with
lectures
on
the
properties
and
tendencies
of
human
nature
forbidding
the
attempt
to
treat
it
as
a
sum
in
rule
of
three
there
were
the
others
the
men
and
women
not
in
the
the
lone
scattered
men
and
women
who
saw
no
flag
but
pity
ragged
skirt
who
heard
no
drum
but
the
world
low
cry
of
pain
who
fought
with
feeble
hands
against
the
wrong
around
them
who
with
aching
heart
and
troubled
eyes
laboured
to
make
kinder
the
little
space
about
them
the
great
army
of
the
nameless
reformers
uncheered
unparagraphed
unhonoured
the
unknown
sowers
of
the
seed
would
the
reapers
of
the
harvest
remember
them
beyond
giving
up
her
visits
to
the
house
she
had
made
no
attempt
to
avoid
meeting
phillips
and
at
public
functions
and
at
mutual
friends
they
sometimes
found
themselves
near
to
one
another
it
surprised
her
that
she
could
see
him
talk
to
him
and
even
be
alone
with
him
without
its
troubling
her
he
seemed
to
belong
to
a
part
of
her
that
lay
dead
and
buried
something
belonging
to
her
that
she
had
thrust
away
with
her
own
hands
that
she
knew
would
never
come
back
to
her
she
was
still
interested
in
his
work
and
keen
to
help
him
it
was
going
to
be
a
stiff
fight
he
himself
in
spite
of
carleton
opposition
had
been
returned
with
an
increased
majority
but
the
party
as
a
whole
had
suffered
loss
especially
in
the
counties
the
struggle
centred
round
the
agricultural
labourer
if
he
could
be
won
over
the
government
would
go
ahead
with
phillips
scheme
otherwise
there
was
danger
of
its
being
shelved
the
difficulty
was
the
old
problem
of
how
to
get
at
the
men
of
the
scattered
villages
the
lonely
cottages
the
only
papers
that
they
ever
saw
were
those
chiefly
of
the
carleton
group
that
the
farmers
and
the
gentry
took
care
should
come
within
their
reach
that
were
handed
to
them
at
the
end
of
their
day
work
as
a
kindly
gift
given
to
the
school
children
to
take
home
with
them
supplied
in
ample
numbers
to
all
the
little
inns
and
in
all
these
phillips
was
held
up
as
their
arch
enemy
his
proposal
explained
as
a
device
to
lower
their
wages
decrease
their
chances
of
employment
and
rob
them
of
the
produce
of
their
gardens
and
allotments
no
arguments
were
used
a
daily
stream
of
abuse
misrepresentation
and
deliberate
lies
set
forth
under
flaming
headlines
served
their
simple
purpose
the
one
weekly
paper
that
had
got
itself
established
among
them
that
their
fathers
had
always
taken
that
dimly
they
had
come
to
look
upon
as
their
one
friend
carleton
had
at
last
succeeded
in
purchasing
when
that
too
pictured
plan
as
a
diabolical
intent
to
take
from
them
even
the
little
that
they
had
and
give
it
to
the
loafing
socialist
and
the
bloated
foreigner
no
room
for
doubt
was
left
to
them
he
had
organized
volunteer
cycle
companies
of
speakers
from
the
towns
young
and
women
and
students
to
go
out
on
summer
evenings
and
hold
meetings
on
the
village
greens
they
were
winning
their
way
but
it
was
slow
work
and
carleton
was
countering
their
efforts
by
a
hired
opposition
that
followed
them
from
place
to
place
and
whose
interruptions
were
made
use
of
to
represent
the
whole
campaign
as
a
fiasco
he
clever
laughed
phillips
i
enjoy
the
fight
if
i
only
myself
to
think
of
and
life
was
so
short
the
laugh
died
away
and
a
shadow
fell
upon
his
face
if
i
could
get
a
few
of
the
big
landlords
to
come
in
on
my
side
he
continued
it
would
make
all
the
difference
in
the
world
sensible
men
some
of
them
and
the
whole
thing
could
be
carried
out
without
injury
to
any
legitimate
interest
i
could
make
them
see
that
if
i
could
only
get
them
quietly
into
a
corner
but
they
frightened
of
me
he
added
with
a
shrug
of
his
broad
shoulders
and
i
do
seem
to
know
how
to
tackle
them
those
might
not
something
of
the
sort
be
possible
not
perhaps
the
sumptuous
salon
of
her
imagination
thronged
with
the
fair
and
famous
suitably
attired
something
perhaps
more
homely
more
immediately
attainable
some
of
the
women
dressed
perhaps
a
little
dowdily
not
all
of
them
young
and
beautiful
the
men
wise
perhaps
rather
than
persistently
witty
a
few
of
them
prosy
maybe
a
trifle
ponderous
but
solid
and
influential
denton

torches

in
the
great
sombre

joan
hazarded
the
suggestion
denton
might
almost
have
been
waiting
for
it
it
would
be
quite
easy
a
little
opening
of
long
fastened
windows
a
lighting
of
chill
grates
a
little
mending
of

a
sweeping
away
of
dust
and
cobwebs

play
her
part

lonely

a
pleading
look
from
the
old
stern
eyes
you
will
have
to
imagine
yourself
my
daughter

said
you
are
taller
but
the
colouring
was
the
same

the
right

a
personage
that
a
landed
gentry
rendered
jumpy
by
the
perpetual
explosion
of
new
ideas
under
their
very
feet
and
casting
about
eagerly
for
friends
could
not
afford
to
snub
a
kindly
simple
folk
quite
intelligent

of
them
as
phillips
had
surmised
denton
made
no
mystery
of
why
she
had
invited
them
why
should
all
questions
be
left
to
the
politicians
and
the
journalists
why
should
not
the
people
interested
take
a
hand
meet
and
talk
over
these
little
matters
with
quiet
voices
and
attentive
ears
amid
surroundings
where
the
unwritten
law
would
restrain
ladies
and
gentlemen
from
addressing
other
ladies
and
gentlemen
as
or
anarchists
as
grinders
of
the
faces
of
the
poor
or
as
rogues
arguments
not
really
conducive
to
mutual
understanding
and
the
bridging
over
of
differences
the
latest
russian
dancer
the
last
new
musical
revue
the
marvellous
things
that
can
happen
at
golf
the
curious
hands
that
one
picks
up
at
bridge
the
eternal
fox
the
sacred
bird
excellent
material
for
of
our
conversation
but
the
remaining
tenth
would
it
be
such
excruciatingly
bad
form
for
us
to
be
intelligent
occasionally
say
on
one
or
two
fridays
during
the
season
denton
wrapped
it
up
tactfully
but
that
was
her
daring
suggestion
it
took
them
aback
at
first
there
were
people
who
did
this
sort
of
thing
people
of
no
class
who
called
themselves
names
and
took
up
things
but
for
people
of
social
standing
to
talk
about
serious
subjects
except
perhaps
in
bed
to
one
wife
it
sounded
so
with
the
elders
it
was
sense
of
duty
that
prevailed
that
at
all
events
was
english
the
country
must
be
saved
to
their
sons
and
daughters
it
was
the
originality
the
novelty
that
gradually
appealed
denton
fridays
became
a
new
sensation
it
came
to
be
the
chic
and
proper
thing
to
appear
at
them
in
shades
of
mauve
or
purple
a
pushing
little
woman
in
hanover
street
designed
the
denton
bodice
with
hanging
sleeves
and
neck
the
younger
men
inclined
towards
a
coat
shaped
to
the
waist
with
a
roll
collar
joan
sighed
it
looked
as
if
the
word
had
been
passed
round
to
treat
the
whole
thing
as
a
joke
denton
took
a
different
view
nothing
better
could
have
happened
she
was
of
opinion
it
means
that
their
hearts
are
in
it
the
stone
hall
was
still
vibrating
to
the
voices
of
the
last
departed
guests
joan
was
seated
on
a
footstool
before
the
fire
in
front
of
denton
chair
it
the
thing
that
gives
me
greatest
hope
she
continued
the
childishness
of
men
and
women
it
means
that
the
world
is
still
young
still
teachable
but
they
so
slow
at
their
lessons
grumbled
joan
one
repeats
it
and
repeats
it
and
then
when
one
feels
that
surely
now
at
least
one
has
drummed
it
into
their
heads
one
finds
they
have
forgotten
all
that
one
has
ever
said
not
always
forgotten
answered
denton
mislaid
it
may
be
for
the
moment
an
indian
student
the
son
of
an
old
rajah
called
on
me
a
little
while
ago
he
was
going
back
to
organize
a
system
of
education
among
his
people
father
heard
you
speak
when
you
were
over
in
india
he
told
me
has
always
been
thinking
about
it
thirty
years
ago
it
must
have
been
that
i
undertook
that
mission
to
india
i
had
always
looked
back
upon
it
as
one
of
my
many
failures
but
why
leave
it
to
his
son
argued
joan
why
could
the
old
man
have
set
about
it
himself
instead
of
wasting
thirty
precious
years
i
should
have
preferred
it
myself
agreed
denton
i
remember
when
i
was
a
very
little
girl
my
mother
longing
for
a
tree
upon
the
lawn
underneath
which
she
could
sit
i
found
an
acorn
and
planted
it
just
in
the
right
spot
i
thought
i
would
surprise
her
i
happened
to
be
in
the
neighbourhood
last
summer
and
i
walked
over
there
was
such
a
nice
old
lady
sitting
under
it
knitting
stockings
so
you
see
it
was
wasted
i
would
mind
the
waiting
answered
joan
if
it
were
not
for
the
sorrow
and
the
suffering
that
i
see
all
round
me
i
want
to
get
rid
of
it
right
away
now
i
could
be
patient
for
myself
but
not
for
others
the
little
old
lady
straightened
herself
there
came
a
hardening
of
the
thin
firm
mouth
and
those
that
have
gone
before
she
demanded
those
that
have
won
the
ground
from
where
we
are
fighting
had
they
no
need
of
patience
was
the
cry
never
wrung
from
their
lips
long
oh
lord
how
long
is
it
for
us
to
lay
aside
the
sword
that
they
bequeath
us
because
we
can
not
hope
any
more
than
they
to
see
the
victory
fifty
years
i
have
fought
and
what
a
few
years
hence
will
my
closing
eyes
still
see
but
the
banners
of
the
foe
still
waving
fresh
armies
pouring
to
his
standard
she
flung
back
her
head
and
the
grim
mouth
broke
into
a
smile
but
i
won
she
said
i
dying
further
forward
i
helped
advance
the
line
she
put
out
her
hands
and
drew
joan
to
her
let
me
think
of
you
she
said
as
taking
my
place
pushing
the
outposts
a
little
further
on
joan
did
not
meet
hilda
again
till
the
child
had
grown
into
a
woman
practically
speaking
she
had
always
been
years
older
than
her
age
it
was
at
a
reception
given
in
the
foreign
office
joan
dress
had
been
trodden
on
and
torn
she
had
struggled
out
of
the
crowd
into
an
empty
room
and
was
examining
the
damage
somewhat
ruefully
when
she
heard
a
voice
behind
her
proffering
help
it
was
a
hard
cold
voice
that
yet
sounded
familiar
and
she
turned
there
was
no
forgetting
those
deep
burning
eyes
though
the
face
had
changed
the
thin
red
lips
still
remained
its
one
touch
of
colour
but
the
unhealthy
whiteness
of
the
skin
had
given
place
to
a
delicate
pallor
and
the
features
that
had
been
indistinct
had
shaped
themselves
in
fine
firm
lines
it
was
a
beautiful
arresting
face
marred
only
by
the
sullen
callousness
of
the
dark
clouded
eyes
joan
was
glad
of
the
assistance
hilda
produced
pins
i
always
come
prepared
to
these
scrimmages
she
explained
i
got
some
hazeline
in
my
bag
they
have
kicked
you
have
they
no
laughed
joan
at
least
i
do
think
so
they
do
sometimes
answered
hilda
if
you
happen
to
be
in
the
way
near
the
feeding
troughs
if
they
only
put
all
the
refreshments
into
one
room
one
could
avoid
it
but
they
will
scatter
them
about
so
that
one
never
knows
for
certain
whether
one
is
in
the
danger
zone
or
not
i
hate
a
mob
why
do
you
come
asked
joan
oh
i
answered
the
girl
i
go
everywhere
where
there
a
chance
of
picking
up
a
swell
husband
they
got
to
come
to
these
shows
they
ca
help
themselves
one
never
knows
what
incident
may
give
one
opportunity
joan
shot
a
glance
the
girl
was
evidently
serious
you
think
it
would
prove
a
useful
alliance
she
suggested
it
would
help
undoubtedly
the
girl
answered
i
do
see
any
other
way
of
getting
hold
of
them
joan
seated
herself
on
one
of
the
chairs
ranged
round
the
walls
and
drew
the
girl
down
beside
her
through
the
closed
door
the
mingled
voices
of
the
foreign
secretary
guests
sounded
curiously
like
the
buzzing
of
flies
it
quite
easy
said
joan
with
your
beauty
especially
if
not
going
to
be
particular
but
is
there
danger
of
your
devotion
to
your
father
leading
you
too
far
a
marriage
founded
on
a
lie
no
matter
for
what
purpose
must
it
degrade
a
woman
smirch
her
soul
for
all
time
we
have
a
right
to
give
up
the
things
that
belong
to
ourselves
but
not
the
things
that
belong
to
god
our
truth
our
sincerity
our
cleanliness
of
mind
and
body
the
things
that
he
may
one
day
want
of
us
it
led
you
into
evil
once
before
do
think
i
judging
you
i
was
no
better
than
you
i
argued
just
as
you
must
have
done
something
stopped
me
just
in
time
that
was
the
only
difference
between
us
the
girl
turned
her
dark
eyes
full
upon
joan
what
did
stop
you
she
demanded
does
it
matter
what
we
call
it
answered
joan
it
was
a
voice
it
told
me
to
do
it
answered
the
girl
did
no
other
voice
speak
to
you
asked
joan
yes
answered
the
girl
the
voice
of
weakness
there
came
a
fierce
anger
into
the
dark
eyes
why
did
you
listen
to
it
she
demanded
all
would
have
been
easy
if
you
had
you
mean
answered
joan
quietly
that
if
i
had
let
your
mother
die
and
had
married
your
father
that
he
and
i
would
have
loved
each
other
to
the
end
that
i
should
have
helped
him
and
encouraged
him
in
all
things
so
that
his
success
would
have
been
certain
is
that
the
argument
did
you
love
him
asked
the
girl
staring
would
you
have
helped
him
i
ca
tell
answered
joan
i
should
have
meant
to
many
men
and
women
have
loved
and
have
meant
to
help
each
other
all
their
lives
and
with
the
years
have
drifted
asunder
coming
even
to
be
against
one
another
we
change
and
our
thoughts
change
slight
differences
of
temperament
grow
into
barriers
between
us
unguessed
antagonisms
widen
into
gulfs
accidents
come
into
our
lives
a
friend
was
telling
me
the
other
day
of
a
woman
who
practically
proposed
to
and
married
a
musical
genius
purely
and
solely
to
be
of
use
to
him
she
earned
quite
a
big
income
drawing
fashions
and
her
idea
was
to
relieve
him
of
the
necessity
of
doing
for
a
living
so
that
he
might
devote
his
whole
time
to
his
real
work
and
a
few
weeks
after
they
were
married
she
ran
the
point
of
a
lead
pencil
through
her
eye
and
it
set
up
inflammation
of
her
brain
and
now
all
the
poor
fellow
has
to
think
of
is
how
to
make
enough
to
pay
for
her
keep
at
a
private
lunatic
asylum
i
do
mean
to
be
flippant
it
the
very
absurdity
of
it
all
that
makes
the
mystery
of
life
that
renders
it
so
hopeless
for
us
to
attempt
to
find
our
way
through
it
by
our
own
judgment
it
is
like
the
ants
making
all
their
clever
laborious
plans
knowing
nothing
of
chickens
and
the
spade
that
is
why
we
have
to
cling
to
the
life
we
can
order
for
ourselves
the
life
within
us
truth
justice
pity
they
are
the
strong
things
the
eternal
things
the
things
we
got
to
sacrifice
ourselves
for
serve
with
our
bodies
and
our
souls
do
think
me
a
prig
she
pleaded
i
talking
as
if
i
knew
all
about
it
i
do
really
i
grope
in
the
dark
and
now
and
then
at
least
so
it
seems
to
me
i
catch
a
glint
of
light
we
are
powerless
in
ourselves
it
is
only
god
working
through
us
that
enables
us
to
be
of
any
use
all
we
can
do
is
to
keep
ourselves
kind
and
clean
and
free
from
self
waiting
for
him
to
come
to
us
the
girl
rose
i
must
be
getting
back
she
said
dad
will
be
wondering
where
i
got
to
she
paused
with
the
door
in
her
hand
and
a
faint
smile
played
round
the
thin
red
lips
tell
me
she
said
what
is
god
a
labourer
together
with
man
according
to
saint
paul
joan
answered
the
girl
turned
and
went
joan
watched
her
as
she
descended
the
great
staircase
she
moved
with
a
curious
gliding
motion
pausing
at
times
for
the
people
to
make
way
for
her
chapter
xvi
it
was
a
summer
evening
joan
had
dropped
in
at
the
greysons
and
had
found
mary
alone
francis
not
having
yet
returned
from
a
bachelor
dinner
at
his
uncle
who
was
some
big
pot
in
the
navy
they
sat
in
the
twilight
facing
the
open
french
windows
through
which
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
park
a
great
stillness
seemed
to
be
around
them
the
sale
and
purchase
of
the
had
been
completed
a
few
days
before
greyson
had
been
offered
the
alternative
of
gradually
and
gracefully
changing
his
opinions
or
getting
out
and
had
of
course
chosen
dismissal
he
was
taking
a
holiday
as
mary
explained
with
a
short
laugh
he
had
some
shares
in
it
himself
had
he
joan
asked
oh
just
enough
to
be
of
no
use
mary
answered
carleton
was
rather
decent
so
far
as
that
part
of
it
was
concerned
and
insisted
on
paying
him
a
fair
price
the
market
value
would
have
been
much
less
and
he
wanted
to
be
out
of
it
joan
remained
silent
it
made
her
mad
that
a
man
could
be
suddenly
robbed
of
fifteen
years
labour
the
weapon
that
his
heart
and
brain
had
made
keen
wrested
from
his
hand
by
a
legal
process
and
turned
against
the
very
principles
for
which
all
his
life
he
had
been
fighting
i
almost
more
sorry
for
myself
than
for
him
said
mary
making
a
whimsical
grimace
he
will
start
something
else
so
soon
as
he
got
over
his
first
soreness
but
i
too
old
to
dream
of
another
child
he
came
in
a
little
later
and
seating
himself
between
them
filled
and
lighted
his
pipe
looking
back
joan
remembered
that
curiously
none
of
them
had
spoken
mary
had
turned
at
the
sound
of
his
key
in
the
door
she
seemed
to
be
watching
him
intently
but
it
was
too
dark
to
notice
her
expression
he
pulled
at
his
pipe
till
it
was
well
alight
and
then
removed
it
it
war
he
said
the
words
made
no
immediate
impression
upon
joan
there
had
been
rumours
threatenings
and
alarms
newspaper
talk
but
so
there
had
been
before
it
would
come
one
day
the
world
war
that
one
felt
was
gathering
in
the
air
that
would
burst
like
a
second
deluge
on
the
nations
but
it
would
not
be
in
our
time
it
was
too
big
a
way
out
would
be
found
is
there
no
hope
asked
mary
yes
he
answered
the
hope
that
a
miracle
may
happen
the
navy
got
its
orders
and
suddenly
as
years
before
in
a
paris
music
hall
there
leapt
to
life
within
joan
brain
a
little
impish
creature
that
took
possession
of
her
she
hoped
the
miracle
would
not
happen
the
little
impish
creature
within
her
brain
was
marching
up
and
down
beating
a
drum
she
wished
he
would
stop
a
minute
someone
was
trying
to
talk
to
her
telling
her
she
ought
to
be
tremendously
shocked
and
grieved
he
or
she
or
whatever
it
was
that
was
trying
to
talk
to
her
appeared
concerned
about
reason
and
pity
and
universal
brotherhood
and
civilization
clock
things
like
that
but
the
little
impish
drummer
was
making
such
a
din
she
properly
hear
later
on
perhaps
he
would
get
tired
and
then
she
would
be
able
to
listen
to
this
humane
and
sensible
person
whoever
it
might
be
mary
argued
that
england
could
and
should
keep
out
of
it
but
greyson
was
convinced
it
would
be
impossible
not
to
say
dishonourable
a
sentiment
that
won
the
enthusiastic
approval
of
the
little
drummer
in
joan
brain
he
played
rule
britannia
and
god
save
the
king
the
marseillaise
and
the
russian
national
hymn
all
at
the
same
time
he
would
have
included
deutschland
uber
alles
if
joan
had
made
a
supreme
effort
and
stopped
him
evidently
a
sporting
little
devil
he
took
himself
off
into
a
corner
after
a
time
where
he
played
quietly
to
himself
and
joan
was
able
to
join
in
the
conversation
greyson
spoke
with
an
enthusiasm
that
was
unusual
to
him
so
many
of
our
wars
had
been
mean
wars
wars
for
the
wrong
sordid
wars
for
territory
for
gold
mines
wars
against
the
weak
at
the
bidding
of
our
traders
our
financiers
shouldering
the
white
man
burden
we
called
it
wars
for
the
right
of
selling
opium
wars
to
perpetuate
the
vile
rule
of
the
turk
because
it
happened
to
serve
our
commercial
interests
this
time
we
were
out
to
play
the
knight
to
save
the
smaller
peoples
to
rescue
our
once
sweet
enemy
fair
france
russia
was
the
disturbing
thought
it
somewhat
discounted
the
idea
riding
stirrup
to
stirrup
beside
that
barbarian
horseman
but
there
were
possibilities
about
russia
idealism
lay
hid
within
that
sleeping
brain
it
would
be
a
holy
war
for
the
kingdom
of
the
peoples
with
germany
freed
from
the
monster
of
blood
and
iron
that
was
crushing
out
her
soul
with
russia
awakened
to
life
we
would
build
the
united
states
of
europe
even
his
voice
was
changed
joan
could
almost
fancy
it
was
some
excited
schoolboy
that
was
talking
mary
had
been
clasping
and
unclasping
her
hands
a
habit
of
hers
when
troubled
could
good
ever
come
out
of
evil
that
was
her
doubt
did
war
ever
do
anything
but
sow
the
seeds
of
future
violence
substitute
one
injustice
for
another
change
wrong
for
wrong
did
it
ever
do
anything
but
add
to
the
world
sum
of
evil
making
god
task
the
heavier
suddenly
while
speaking
she
fell
into
a
passionate
fit
of
weeping
she
went
on
through
her
tears
it
will
be
terrible
she
said
it
will
last
longer
than
you
say
every
nation
will
be
drawn
into
it
there
will
be
no
voice
left
to
speak
for
reason
every
day
we
shall
grow
more
brutalized
more
pitiless
it
will
degrade
us
crush
the
soul
out
of
us
blood
and
iron
it
will
become
our
god
too
the
god
of
all
the
world
you
say
we
are
going
into
it
with
clean
hands
this
time
how
long
will
they
keep
clean
the
people
who
only
live
for
making
money
how
long
do
you
think
they
will
remain
silent
what
has
been
all
the
talk
of
the
last
ten
years
but
of
capturing
german
trade
we
shall
be
told
that
we
owe
it
to
our
dead
to
make
a
profit
out
of
them
that
otherwise
they
will
have
died
in
vain
who
will
care
for
the
people
but
to
use
them
for
killing
one
another
to
hound
them
on
like
dogs
in
every
country
nothing
but
greed
and
hatred
will
be
preached
horrible
men
and
women
will
write
to
the
papers
crying
out
for
more
blood
more
cruelty
everything
that
can
make
for
anger
and
revenge
will
be
screamed
from
every
newspaper
every
plea
for
humanity
will
be
jeered
at
as
sentimentality
every
man
and
woman
who
remembers
the
ideals
with
which
we
started
will
be
shrieked
at
as
a
traitor
the
people
who
are
doing
well
out
of
it
they
will
get
hold
of
the
press
appeal
to
the
passions
of
the
mob
nobody
else
will
be
allowed
to
speak
it
always
has
been
so
in
war
it
always
will
be
this
will
be
no
exception
merely
because
it
bigger
every
country
will
be
given
over
to
savagery
there
will
be
no
appeal
against
it
the
whole
world
will
sink
back
into
the
beast
she
ended
by
rising
abruptly
and
wishing
them
her
outburst
had
silenced
joan
impish
drummer
for
the
time
he
appeared
to
be
nervous
and
depressed
but
bucked
up
again
on
the
way
to
the
bus
greyson
walked
with
her
as
usual
they
took
the
long
way
round
by
the
outer
circle
poor
mary
he
said
i
should
not
have
talked
before
her
if
i
had
thought
her
horror
of
war
is
almost
physical
she
will
not
even
read
about
them
it
has
the
same
effect
upon
her
as
stories
of
cruelty
but
there
truth
in
a
good
deal
that
she
says
he
added
war
can
bring
out
all
that
is
best
in
a
people
but
also
it
brings
out
the
worst
we
shall
have
to
take
care
that
the
ideals
are
not
lost
sight
of
i
wish
this
wretched
business
of
the
paper
had
come
just
at
this
time
said
joan
just
when
your
voice
is
most
needed
could
you
get
enough
money
together
to
start
something
quickly
she
continued
the
idea
suddenly
coming
to
her
i
think
i
could
help
you
it
would
matter
its
being
something
small
to
begin
with
so
long
as
it
was
entirely
your
own
and
could
be
taken
away
from
you
soon
work
it
up
thanks
he
answered
i
may
ask
you
to
later
on
but
just
now
he
paused
of
course
for
war
you
wanted
men
to
fight
she
had
been
thinking
of
them
in
the
lump
hurrying
masses
such
as
one
sees
on
cinema
screens
blurred
but
picturesque
of
course
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
they
would
have
to
be
made
up
of
individuals
boyish
sort
of
men
who
would
pass
through
doors
one
at
a
time
into
little
rooms
give
their
name
and
address
to
a
soldier
man
seated
at
a
big
deal
table
later
on
one
would
say
to
them
on
crowded
platforms
wave
a
handkerchief
not
all
of
them
would
come
back
you
ca
make
omelettes
without
breaking
eggs
she
told
herself
it
annoyed
her
that
silly
saying
having
come
into
her
mind
she
could
see
them
lying
there
with
their
white
faces
to
the
night
surely
she
might
have
thought
of
some
remark
less
idiotic
to
make
to
herself
at
such
a
time
he
was
explaining
to
her
things
about
the
air
service
it
seemed
he
had
had
experience
in
flying
some
relation
of
his
with
whom
he
had
spent
a
holiday
last
summer
it
would
mean
his
getting
out
quickly
he
seemed
quite
eager
to
be
gone
is
it
rather
dangerous
work
she
asked
she
felt
it
was
a
footling
question
even
as
she
asked
it
her
brain
had
become
stodgy
nothing
like
as
dangerous
as
being
in
the
infantry
he
answered
and
that
would
be
my
only
other
alternative
besides
i
get
out
of
the
drilling
he
laughed
i
should
hate
being
shouted
at
and
ordered
about
by
a
husky
old
sergeant
they
neither
spoke
again
till
they
came
to
the
bridge
from
the
other
side
of
which
the
busses
started
i
may
not
see
you
again
before
i
go
he
said
look
after
mary
i
shall
try
to
persuade
her
to
go
down
to
her
aunt
in
hampshire
rather
a
bit
of
luck
as
it
turns
out
the
paper
being
finished
with
i
should
have
quite
known
what
to
do
he
had
stopped
at
the
corner
they
were
still
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
trees
quite
unconsciously
she
put
her
face
up
and
as
if
it
had
always
been
the
custom
at
their
partings
he
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
though
it
really
was
for
the
first
time
she
walked
home
instead
of
taking
the
bus
she
wanted
to
think
a
day
or
two
would
decide
the
question
she
determined
that
if
the
miracle
did
not
happen
she
would
go
down
to
liverpool
her
father
was
on
the
committee
of
one
of
the
great
hospitals
and
she
knew
one
or
two
of
the
matrons
she
would
want
to
be
doing
something
to
get
out
to
the
front
if
possible
maybe
her
desire
to
serve
was
not
altogether
free
from
curiosity
from
the
craving
for
adventure
there
a
spice
of
the
man
even
in
the
best
of
women
her
conscience
plagued
her
when
she
thought
of
denton
for
some
time
now
they
had
been
very
close
together
and
the
old
lady
had
come
to
depend
upon
her
she
waited
till
all
doubt
was
ended
before
calling
to
say
denton
was
seated
before
an
old
bureau
that
had
long
stood
locked
in
a
corner
of
the
library
the
drawers
were
open
and
books
and
papers
were
scattered
about
joan
told
her
plans
you
be
able
to
get
along
without
me
for
a
little
while
she
asked
doubtfully
denton
laughed
i
have
much
more
to
do
she
answered
just
tidying
up
as
you
see
and
two
or
three
things
i
shall
try
to
complete
after
that
i
perhaps
take
a
rest
she
took
from
among
the
litter
a
faded
photograph
and
handed
it
to
joan
odd
she
said
i
just
turned
it
out
it
represented
a
long
thin
line
of
eminently
respectable
ladies
and
gentlemen
in
early
victorian
costume
the
men
in
trousers
and
silk
stocks
the
women
in
crinolines
and
poke
bonnets
among
them
holding
the
hand
of
a
stoutish
gentleman
was
a
mere
girl
the
terminating
frills
of
a
white
unmentionable
garment
showed
beneath
her
skirts
she
wore
a
porkpie
hat
with
a
feather
in
it
my
first
public
appearance
explained
denton
i
teased
my
father
into
taking
me
with
him
we
represented
great
britain
and
ireland
i
suppose
i
the
only
one
left
i
should
have
recognized
you
laughed
joan
what
was
the
occasion
the
great
international
peace
congress
at
paris
explained
denton
just
after
the
crimean
war
it
made
quite
a
stir
at
the
time
the
emperor
opened
our
proceedings
in
person
and
the
pope
and
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
both
sent
us
their
blessing
we
had
a
copy
of
the
speeches
presented
to
us
on
leaving
in
every
known
language
in
europe
bound
in
vellum
i
hoping
to
find
it
and
the
press
was
enthusiastic
there
were
to
be
acts
of
parliament
courts
of
arbitration
international
laws
diplomatic
treaties
a
was
appointed
to
prepare
a
special
set
of
prayers
and
a
palace
of
peace
was
to
be
erected
there
was
only
one
thing
we
forgot
and
that
was
the
foundation
i
may
not
be
here
she
continued
when
the
new
plans
are
submitted
tell
them
not
to
forget
the
foundation
this
time
tell
them
to
teach
the
children
joan
dined
at
a
popular
restaurant
that
evening
she
fancied
it
might
cheer
her
up
but
the
noisy
patriotism
of
the
crowd
only
irritated
her
these
elderly
flabby
men
these
fleshy
women
who
would
form
the
spectators
who
would
loll
on
their
cushioned
seats
protected
from
the
sun
munching
contentedly
from
their
baskets
while
listening
to
the
dying
groans
rising
upwards
from
the
drenched
arena
she
glanced
from
one
podgy
thumb
to
another
and
a
feeling
of
nausea
crept
over
her
suddenly
the
band
struck
up
god
save
the
king
three
commonplace
enough
young
men
seated
at
a
table
near
to
her
laid
down
their
napkins
and
stood
up
yes
there
was
something
to
be
said
for
war
she
felt
as
she
looked
at
their
boyish
faces
transfigured
not
for
them
business
as
usual
the
capture
of
german
trade
other
visions
those
young
eyes
were
seeing
the
little
imp
within
her
brain
had
seized
his
drum
again
follow
me
so
he
seemed
to
beat
i
teach
men
courage
duty
the
laying
down
of
self
i
open
the
gates
of
honour
i
make
heroes
out
of
dust
is
it
worth
my
price
a
figure
was
loitering
the
other
side
of
the
street
when
she
reached
home
she
thought
she
somehow
recognized
it
and
crossed
over
it
was
mckean
smoking
his
everlasting
pipe
success
having
demanded
some
such
change
he
had
migrated
to
the
albany
and
she
had
not
seen
him
for
some
time
he
had
come
to
have
a
last
look
at
the
house
in
case
it
might
happen
to
be
the
last
he
was
off
to
scotland
the
next
morning
where
he
intended
to
join
up
but
are
you
sure
it
your
particular
duty
suggested
joan
i
told
you
become
a
household
word
both
in
germany
and
france
if
we
really
are
out
to
end
war
and
establish
the
brotherhood
of
nations
the
work
you
are
doing
is
of
more
importance
than
even
the
killing
of
germans
it
is
as
if
there
would
be
enough
without
you
to
tell
the
truth
he
answered
that
exactly
what
i
been
saying
to
myself
i
sha
be
any
good
i
do
see
myself
sticking
a
bayonet
into
even
a
german
unless
he
happened
to
be
abnormally
clumsy
i
tried
to
shoot
a
rabbit
once
i
might
have
done
it
if
the
little
beggar
instead
of
running
away
had
turned
and
looked
at
me
i
should
keep
out
of
it
if
i
were
you
laughed
joan
i
ca
he
answered
i
too
great
a
coward
an
odd
reason
for
enlisting
thought
joan
i
could
face
it
he
went
on
the
way
people
would
be
looking
at
me
in
trains
and
omnibuses
the
things
people
would
say
of
me
the
things
i
should
imagine
they
were
saying
what
my
valet
would
be
thinking
of
me
oh
i
ashamed
enough
of
myself
it
the
artistic
temperament
i
suppose
we
must
always
be
admired
praised
we
not
the
stuff
that
martyrs
are
made
of
we
must
for
ever
be
to
the
cackling
geese
around
us
we
so
terrified
lest
they
should
hiss
us
the
street
was
empty
they
were
pacing
it
slowly
up
and
down
i
always
been
a
coward
he
continued
i
fell
in
love
with
you
the
first
day
i
met
you
on
the
stairs
but
i
dared
not
tell
you
you
did
give
me
that
impression
answered
joan
she
had
always
found
it
difficult
to
know
when
to
take
him
seriously
and
when
not
i
was
so
afraid
you
would
find
it
out
he
explained
you
thought
i
would
take
advantage
of
it
she
suggested
one
can
never
be
sure
of
a
woman
he
answered
and
it
would
have
been
so
difficult
there
was
a
girl
down
in
scotland
one
of
the
village
girls
it
was
anything
really
we
had
just
been
children
together
but
they
all
thought
i
had
gone
away
to
make
my
fortune
so
as
to
come
back
and
marry
her
even
my
mother
it
would
have
looked
so
mean
if
after
getting
on
i
had
married
a
fine
london
lady
i
could
never
have
gone
home
again
but
you
have
married
her
or
have
you
asked
joan
no
he
answered
she
wrote
me
a
beautiful
letter
that
i
shall
always
keep
begging
me
to
forgive
her
and
hoping
i
might
be
happy
she
had
married
a
young
farmer
and
was
going
out
to
canada
my
mother
will
never
allow
her
name
to
be
mentioned
in
our
house
they
had
reached
the
end
of
the
street
again
joan
held
out
her
hand
with
a
laugh
thanks
for
the
compliment
she
said
though
i
notice
you
wait
till
you
going
away
before
telling
me
but
quite
seriously
she
added
give
it
a
little
more
thought
the
enlisting
i
mean
the
world
is
too
rich
in
kind
influences
it
needs
men
like
you
come
pull
yourself
together
and
show
a
little
pluck
she
laughed
i
try
he
promised
but
it
wo
be
any
use
i
shall
drift
about
the
streets
seeking
to
put
heart
into
myself
but
all
the
while
my
footsteps
will
be
bearing
me
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
recruiting
office
and
outside
the
door
some
girl
in
the
crowd
will
smile
approval
or
some
old
fool
will
pat
me
on
the
shoulder
and
i
shall
sneak
in
and
it
will
close
behind
me
it
must
be
fine
to
have
courage
he
wrote
her
two
days
later
from
ayr
giving
her
the
name
of
his
regiment
and
again
some
six
months
later
from
flanders
but
there
would
have
been
no
sense
in
her
replying
to
that
last
she
lingered
in
the
street
by
herself
a
little
time
after
he
had
turned
the
corner
it
had
been
a
house
of
sorrow
and
disappointment
to
her
but
so
also
she
had
dreamed
her
dreams
there
seen
her
visions
she
had
never
made
much
headway
with
her
landlord
and
her
landlady
a
worthy
couple
who
had
proved
most
excellent
servants
but
who
prided
themselves
to
use
their
own
expression
on
knowing
their
place
and
keeping
themselves
to
themselves
joan
had
given
them
notice
that
morning
and
had
been
surprised
at
the
woman
bursting
into
tears
i
felt
it
just
the
same
when
young
mckean
left
us
she
explained
with
apologies
he
had
been
with
us
five
years
he
was
like
you
miss
so
unpracticable
i
got
used
to
looking
after
him
mary
greyson
called
on
her
in
the
morning
while
she
was
still
at
breakfast
she
had
come
from
seeing
francis
off
by
an
early
train
from
euston
he
had
sent
joan
a
ring
he
is
so
afraid
you
may
not
be
able
to
wear
it
that
it
will
not
fit
you
said
mary
but
i
told
him
i
was
sure
it
would
joan
held
our
her
hand
for
the
letter
i
was
afraid
he
had
forgotten
it
she
answered
with
a
smile
she
placed
the
ring
on
her
finger
and
held
out
her
hand
i
might
have
been
measured
for
it
she
said
i
wonder
how
he
knew
you
left
a
glove
behind
you
the
first
day
you
ever
came
to
our
house
mary
explained
and
i
kept
it
she
was
following
his
wishes
and
going
down
into
the
country
they
did
not
meet
again
until
after
the
war
madge
dropped
in
on
her
during
the
week
and
brought
flossie
with
her
flossie
husband
sam
had
departed
for
the
navy
and
niel
singleton
who
had
offered
and
been
rejected
for
the
army
had
joined
a
red
cross
unit
madge
herself
was
taking
up
canteen
work
joan
rather
expected
flossie
to
be
in
favour
of
the
war
and
madge
against
it
instead
of
which
it
turned
out
the
other
way
round
it
seemed
difficult
to
forecast
opinion
in
this
matter
madge
thought
that
england
in
particular
had
been
too
much
given
up
to
luxury
and
pleasure
there
had
been
too
much
idleness
and
empty
laughter
hitchicoo
dances
and
women
undressing
themselves
upon
the
stage
even
the
working
classes
seemed
to
think
of
nothing
else
but
cinemas
and
beer
she
dreamed
of
a
united
kingdom
purified
by
suffering
cleansed
by
tears
its
people
drawn
together
by
memory
of
common
sacrifice
class
antagonism
buried
in
the
grave
where
duke
son
and
cook
son
would
lie
side
by
side
of
a
europe
rising
from
the
ashes
of
the
old
with
germany
beaten
her
lust
of
war
burnt
out
her
hideous
doctrine
of
force
proved
to
be
false
the
world
would
breathe
a
freer
air
passion
and
hatred
would
fall
from
man
eyes
the
people
would
see
one
another
and
join
hands
flossie
was
sceptical
why
has
it
done
it
before
she
wanted
to
know
good
lord
there
been
enough
of
it
why
did
we
all
kiss
and
be
friends
after
the
napoleonic
wars
she
demanded
instead
of
getting
up
peterloo
massacres
and
law
riots
and
breaking
the
duke
of
wellington
windows
all
this
talk
of
downing
militarism
she
continued
it
like
trying
to
do
away
with
the
other
sort
of
disorderly
house
you
do
stamp
out
a
vice
by
chivying
it
round
the
corner
when
men
and
women
have
become
decent
there
will
be
no
more
disorderly
houses
but
it
wo
come
before
suppose
we
do
knock
militarism
out
of
germany
like
we
did
out
of
france
not
so
very
long
ago
it
will
only
slip
round
the
corner
into
russia
or
japan
come
and
settle
over
here
as
likely
as
not
especially
if
we
have
a
few
victories
and
get
to
fancy
ourselves
madge
was
of
opinion
that
the
world
would
have
had
enough
of
war
not
armies
but
whole
peoples
would
be
involved
this
time
the
lesson
would
be
driven
home
oh
yes
we
shall
have
had
enough
of
it
agreed
flossie
by
the
time
we
paid
up
there
no
doubt
of
that
what
about
our
children
just
left
young
frank
strutting
all
over
the
house
and
flourishing
a
paper
knife
and
the
servants
have
had
to
bar
the
kitchen
door
to
prevent
his
bursting
in
every
five
minutes
and
attacking
them
what
he
going
to
say
when
i
tell
him
later
on
that
his
father
and
myself
have
had
all
the
war
we
want
and
have
decided
there
shall
be
no
more
the
old
folks
have
had
their
fun
why
should
i
have
mine
that
will
be
his
argument
you
ca
do
it
she
concluded
unless
you
are
prepared
to
keep
half
the
world
literature
away
from
the
children
scrap
half
your
music
edit
your
museums
and
your
picture
galleries
bowdlerize
your
old
testament
and
rewrite
your
histories
and
then
you
have
to
be
careful
for
hours
a
day
that
they
never
see
a
madge
still
held
to
her
hope
god
would
make
a
wind
of
reason
to
pass
over
the
earth
he
would
not
smite
again
his
people
i
wish
poor
dear
sam
could
have
been
kept
out
of
it
said
flossie
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
finished
her
tea
joan
had
arranged
to
leave
on
the
monday
she
ran
down
to
see
mary
stopperton
on
the
saturday
afternoon
stopperton
had
died
the
year
before
and
mary
had
been
a
little
hurt
divining
insincerity
in
the
condolences
offered
to
her
by
most
of
her
friends
you
did
know
him
dear
she
had
said
to
joan
all
his
faults
were
on
the
outside
she
did
not
want
to
talk
about
the
war
perhaps
it
wrong
of
me
she
said
but
it
makes
me
so
sad
and
i
can
do
nothing
she
had
been
busy
at
her
machine
when
joan
had
entered
and
a
pile
of
delicate
white
work
lay
folded
on
a
chair
beside
her
what
are
you
making
asked
joan
the
little
withered
face
lighted
up
guess
she
said
as
she
unfolded
and
displayed
a
tiny
garment
i
so
love
making
them
she
said
i
say
to
myself
will
all
come
right
god
will
send
more
and
more
of
his
christ
babies
till
at
last
there
will
be
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
everywhere
and
their
love
will
change
the
world
her
bright
eyes
had
caught
sight
of
the
ring
upon
joan
hand
she
touched
it
with
her
little
fragile
fingers
you
will
let
me
make
one
for
you
dearie
wo
you
she
said
i
feel
sure
it
will
be
a
little
christ
baby
arthur
was
still
away
when
she
arrived
home
he
had
gone
to
norway
on
business
her
father
was
afraid
he
would
find
it
difficult
to
get
back
telegraphic
communication
had
been
stopped
and
they
had
had
no
news
of
him
her
father
was
worried
a
big
government
contract
had
come
in
while
many
of
his
best
men
had
left
to
enlist
i
fixed
you
up
all
right
at
the
hospital
he
said
it
was
good
of
you
to
think
of
coming
home
do
go
away
for
a
bit
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
asked
anything
of
her
another
fortnight
passed
before
they
heard
from
arthur
and
then
he
wrote
them
both
from
hull
he
would
be
somewhere
in
the
north
sea
mine
sweeping
when
they
read
his
letters
he
had
hoped
to
get
a
day
or
two
to
run
across
and
say
but
the
need
for
men
was
pressing
and
he
had
not
liked
to
plead
excuses
the
boat
by
which
he
had
managed
to
leave
bergen
had
gone
down
he
and
a
few
others
had
been
picked
up
but
the
sights
that
he
had
seen
were
haunting
him
he
felt
sure
his
uncle
would
agree
that
he
ought
to
be
helping
and
this
was
work
for
england
he
could
do
with
all
his
heart
he
hoped
he
was
not
leaving
his
uncle
in
the
lurch
but
he
did
not
think
the
war
would
last
long
and
he
would
soon
be
back
dear
lad
said
her
father
he
would
take
the
most
dangerous
work
that
he
could
find
but
i
wish
he
had
been
quite
so
impulsive
he
could
have
been
of
more
use
helping
me
with
this
war
office
contract
i
suppose
he
never
got
my
letter
telling
him
about
it
in
his
letter
to
joan
he
went
further
he
had
received
his
letter
so
he
confided
to
her
perhaps
she
would
think
him
a
crank
but
he
could
help
it
he
hated
this
killing
business
this
making
of
machinery
for
slaughtering
men
in
bulk
like
they
killed
pigs
in
chicago
out
on
the
free
sweet
sea
helping
to
keep
it
clean
from
abominations
he
would
be
away
from
it
all
she
saw
the
vision
of
him
that
night
as
leaning
from
her
window
she
looked
out
beyond
the
pines
the
little
lonely
ship
amid
the
waste
of
waters
his
beautiful
almost
womanish
face
and
the
gentle
dreamy
eyes
with
their
haunting
suggestion
of
a
shadow
her
little
drummer
played
less
and
less
frequently
to
her
as
the
months
passed
by
it
did
seem
to
be
the
war
he
had
looked
forward
to
the
illustrated
papers
continued
to
picture
it
as
a
sort
of
glorified
picnic
where
smiling
young
men
lolled
luxuriously
in
cosy
reading
their
favourite
paper
by
curious
coincidence
it
generally
happened
to
be
the
journal
publishing
the
photograph
occasionally
it
appeared
they
came
across
the
enemy
who
then
put
up
both
hands
and
shouted
kamerad
but
the
weary
wounded
men
she
talked
to
told
another
story
she
grew
impatient
of
the
fighters
with
their
mouths
the
savage
old
baldheads
heroically
prepared
to
sacrifice
the
last
young
man
the
sleek
purring
women
who
talked
childish
nonsense
about
killing
every
man
woman
and
child
in
germany
but
quite
meant
it
the
shrieking
journalists
who
had
decided
that
their
place
was
the
home
front
the
mobs
the
spy
hunters
chasing
terrified
old
men
and
sobbing
children
through
the
streets
it
was
a
relief
to
enter
the
quiet
ward
and
close
the
door
behind
her
the
the
traders
and
pedlars
the
balladmongers
and
the
mountebanks
the
ghoulish
sightseers
war
brought
out
all
that
was
worst
in
them
but
the
givers
of
their
blood
the
lads
who
suffered
who
had
made
the
sacrifice
war
had
taught
them
chivalry
manhood
she
heard
no
revilings
of
hatred
and
revenge
from
those
drawn
lips
patience
humour
forgiveness
they
had
learnt
from
war
they
told
her
kindly
stories
even
of
hans
and
fritz
the
little
drummer
in
her
brain
would
creep
out
of
his
corner
play
to
her
softly
while
she
moved
about
among
them
one
day
she
received
a
letter
from
folk
he
had
come
to
london
at
the
request
of
the
french
government
to
consult
with
english
artists
on
a
matter
he
must
not
mention
he
would
not
have
the
time
he
told
her
to
run
down
to
liverpool
could
she
get
a
couple
of
days
leave
and
dine
with
him
in
london
she
found
him
in
the
uniform
of
a
french
colonel
he
had
quite
a
military
bearing
and
seemed
pleased
with
himself
he
kissed
her
hand
and
then
held
her
out
at
arms
length
it
wonderful
how
like
you
are
to
your
mother
he
said
i
wish
i
were
as
young
as
i
feel
she
had
written
him
at
the
beginning
of
the
war
telling
him
of
her
wish
to
get
out
to
the
front
and
he
thought
that
now
he
might
be
able
to
help
her
but
perhaps
you
changed
your
mind
he
said
it
is
quite
as
pretty
as
it
painted
i
want
to
she
answered
it
is
all
curiosity
i
think
it
time
for
women
to
insist
on
seeing
war
with
their
own
eyes
not
trust
any
longer
to
the
pictures
you
men
paint
she
smiled
but
i
got
to
give
it
up
she
added
i
ca
leave
dad
they
were
sitting
in
the
hall
of
the
hotel
it
was
the
dressing
hour
and
the
place
was
almost
empty
he
shot
a
swift
glance
at
her
arthur
is
still
away
she
explained
and
i
feel
that
he
wants
me
i
should
be
worrying
myself
thinking
of
him
all
alone
with
no
one
to
look
after
him
it
the
mother
instinct
i
suppose
it
always
has
hampered
woman
she
laughed
dear
old
boy
he
said
he
was
watching
her
with
a
little
smile
glad
he
got
some
luck
at
last
they
dined
in
the
great
restaurant
belonging
to
the
hotel
he
was
still
vastly
pleased
with
himself
as
he
marched
up
the
crowded
room
with
joan
upon
his
arm
he
held
himself
upright
and
talked
and
laughed
perhaps
louder
than
an
elderly
gentleman
should
swaggering
old
beggar
he
must
have
overheard
a
young
sub
mutter
as
they
passed
but
he
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
they
lingered
over
the
meal
folk
was
a
brilliant
talker
most
of
the
men
whose
names
were
filling
the
newspapers
had
sat
to
him
at
one
time
or
another
he
made
them
seem
quite
human
joan
was
surprised
at
the
time
come
up
to
my
rooms
will
you
he
asked
there
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
and
then
i
walk
back
with
you
she
was
staying
at
a
small
hotel
off
jermyn
street
he
sat
her
down
by
the
fire
and
went
into
the
next
room
he
had
a
letter
in
his
hand
when
he
returned
joan
noticed
that
the
envelope
was
written
upon
across
the
corner
but
she
was
not
near
enough
to
distinguish
the
handwriting
he
placed
it
on
the
mantelpiece
and
sat
down
opposite
her
so
you
have
come
to
love
the
dear
old
chap
he
said
i
have
always
loved
him
joan
answered
it
was
he
did
love
me
for
a
time
as
i
thought
but
i
know
now
that
he
does
he
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
and
then
he
leant
across
and
took
her
hands
in
his
i
am
going
he
said
where
there
is
just
the
possibility
of
an
accident
one
never
knows
i
wanted
to
be
sure
that
all
was
well
with
you
he
was
looking
at
the
ring
upon
her
hand
a
soldier
boy
he
asked
yes
she
answered
if
he
comes
back
there
was
a
little
catch
in
her
voice
i
know
he
come
back
he
said
i
wo
tell
you
why
i
am
so
sure
perhaps
you
would
believe
he
was
still
holding
her
hands
looking
into
her
eyes
tell
me
he
said
did
you
see
your
mother
before
she
died
did
she
speak
to
you
no
joan
answered
i
was
too
late
she
had
died
the
night
before
i
hardly
recognized
her
when
i
saw
her
she
looked
so
sweet
and
young
she
loved
you
very
dearly
he
said
better
than
herself
all
those
years
of
sorrow
they
came
to
her
because
of
that
i
thought
it
foolish
of
her
at
the
time
but
now
i
know
she
was
wise
i
want
you
always
to
love
and
honour
her
i
would
ask
you
if
it
was
right
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
it
quite
easy
she
answered
i
always
see
her
as
she
lay
there
with
all
the
sorrow
gone
from
her
she
looked
so
beautiful
and
kind
he
rose
and
took
the
letter
from
where
he
had
placed
it
on
the
mantelpiece
he
stooped
and
held
it
out
above
the
fire
and
a
little
flame
leaped
up
and
seemed
to
take
it
from
his
hand
they
neither
spoke
during
the
short
walk
between
the
two
hotels
but
at
the
door
she
turned
and
held
out
her
hands
to
him
thank
you
she
said
for
being
so
kind
and
wise
i
shall
always
love
and
honour
her
he
kissed
her
promising
to
take
care
of
himself
she
ran
against
phillips
the
next
day
at
one
of
the
big
stores
where
she
was
shopping
he
had
obtained
a
commission
early
in
the
war
and
was
now
a
captain
he
had
just
come
back
from
the
front
on
leave
the
alternative
had
not
appealed
to
him
of
being
one
of
those
responsible
for
sending
other
men
to
death
while
remaining
himself
in
security
and
comfort
it
a
matter
of
temperament
he
said
somebody
got
to
stop
behind
and
do
the
patriotic
speechifying
i
glad
i
did
especially
after
what
i
seen
he
had
lost
interest
in
politics
there
something
bigger
coming
he
said
here
everything
seems
to
be
going
on
much
the
same
but
over
there
you
feel
it
something
growing
silently
out
of
all
this
blood
and
mud
i
find
myself
wondering
what
the
men
are
staring
at
but
when
i
look
there
nothing
as
far
as
my
glasses
will
reach
but
waste
and
desolation
and
it
is
only
on
the
faces
of
our
own
men
it
in
the
eyes
of
the
prisoners
too
as
if
they
saw
something
a
funny
ending
to
the
war
if
the
people
began
to
think
phillips
was
running
a
convalescent
home
in
folkestone
he
told
her
and
had
even
made
a
speech
hilda
was
doing
relief
work
among
the
ruined
villages
of
france
it
a
new
world
we
shall
be
called
upon
to
build
he
said
we
must
pay
more
heed
to
the
foundation
this
time
she
seldom
discussed
the
war
with
her
father
at
the
beginning
he
had
dreamed
with
greyson
of
a
short
and
glorious
campaign
that
should
weld
all
classes
together
and
after
which
we
should
forgive
our
enemies
and
shape
with
them
a
better
world
but
as
the
months
went
by
he
appeared
to
grow
indifferent
and
joan
who
got
about
twelve
hours
a
day
of
it
outside
welcomed
other
subjects
it
surprised
her
when
one
evening
after
dinner
he
introduced
it
himself
what
are
you
going
to
do
when
it
over
he
asked
her
you
wo
give
up
the
fight
will
you
whatever
happens
she
had
not
known
till
then
that
he
had
been
taking
any
interest
in
her
work
no
she
answered
with
a
laugh
no
matter
what
happens
i
shall
always
want
to
be
in
it
good
lad
he
said
patting
her
on
the
shoulder
it
will
be
an
ugly
world
that
will
come
out
of
all
this
hate
and
anger
the
lord
will
want
all
the
help
that
he
can
get
and
you
do
forget
our
compact
do
you
he
continued
that
i
am
to
be
your
backer
i
want
to
be
in
it
too
she
shot
a
glance
at
him
he
was
looking
at
the
portrait
of
that
old
ironside
allway
who
had
fought
and
died
to
make
a
nobler
england
as
he
had
dreamed
a
grim
unprepossessing
gentleman
unless
the
artist
had
done
him
much
injustice
with
high
narrow
forehead
and
puzzled
staring
eyes
she
took
the
cigarette
from
her
lips
and
her
voice
trembled
a
little
i
want
you
to
be
something
more
to
me
than
that
sir
she
said
i
want
to
feel
that
i
an
allway
fighting
for
the
things
we
always
had
at
heart
i
try
and
be
worthy
of
the
name
her
hand
stole
out
to
him
across
the
table
but
she
kept
her
face
away
from
him
until
she
felt
his
grasp
grow
tight
and
then
she
turned
and
their
eyes
met
you
be
the
last
of
the
name
he
said
something
tells
me
that
glad
you
a
fighter
i
always
prayed
my
child
might
be
a
fighter
arthur
had
not
been
home
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
twice
he
had
written
them
to
expect
him
but
the
little
fleet
of
mine
sweepers
had
been
hard
pressed
and
on
both
occasions
his
leave
had
been
stopped
at
the
last
moment
one
afternoon
he
turned
up
unexpectedly
at
the
hospital
it
was
a
few
weeks
after
the
conscription
act
had
been
passed
joan
took
him
into
her
room
at
the
end
of
the
ward
from
where
through
the
open
door
she
could
still
keep
watch
they
spoke
in
low
tones
it
done
you
good
said
joan
you
look
every
inch
the
jolly
jack
tar
he
was
hard
and
tanned
and
his
eyes
were
marvellously
bright
yes
he
said
i
love
the
sea
it
clean
and
strong
a
fear
was
creeping
over
her
why
have
you
come
back
she
asked
he
hesitated
keeping
his
eyes
upon
the
ground
i
do
suppose
you
will
agree
with
me
he
said
somehow
i
felt
i
had
to
a
conscientious
objector
she
might
have
guessed
it
a
conchy
as
they
would
call
him
in
the
press
all
the
spiteful
screamers
who
had
never
risked
a
scratch
themselves
denouncing
him
as
a
coward
the
local
dogberrys
of
the
tribunals
would
fire
off
their
little
stock
of
gibes
and
platitudes
upon
him
propound
with
owlish
solemnity
the
new
christianity
abuse
him
and
condemn
him
without
listening
to
him
jeering
mobs
would
follow
him
through
the
streets
more
than
once
of
late
she
had
encountered
such
crowds
made
up
of
shrieking
girls
and
mouthed
men
surging
round
some
youngster
while
the
looked
on
and
grinned
she
came
to
him
and
stood
over
him
with
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
must
you
dear
she
said
ca
you
reconcile
it
to
yourself
to
go
on
with
your
work
of
mercy
of
saving
poor
folks
lives
he
raised
his
eyes
to
hers
the
shadow
that
to
her
fancy
had
always
rested
there
seemed
to
have
departed
a
light
had
come
to
them
there
are
more
important
things
than
saving
men
bodies
you
think
that
do
you
he
asked
yes
she
answered
i
wo
try
to
hold
you
back
dear
if
you
think
you
can
do
that
he
caught
her
hands
and
held
them
i
wanted
to
be
a
coward
he
said
to
keep
out
of
the
fight
i
thought
of
the
shame
of
the
petty
persecutions
that
even
you
might
despise
me
but
i
could
i
was
always
seeing
his
face
before
me
with
his
beautiful
tender
eyes
and
the
blood
drops
on
his
brow
it
is
he
alone
can
save
the
world
it
is
perishing
for
want
of
love
and
by
a
little
suffering
i
might
be
able
to
help
him
and
then
one
night
i
suppose
it
was
a
piece
of
driftwood
there
rose
up
out
of
the
sea
a
little
cross
that
seemed
to
call
to
me
to
stretch
out
my
hand
and
grasp
it
and
gird
it
to
my
side
he
had
risen
do
you
see
he
said
it
is
only
by
suffering
that
one
can
help
him
it
is
the
sword
that
he
has
chosen
by
which
one
day
he
will
conquer
the
world
and
this
is
such
a
splendid
opportunity
to
fight
for
him
it
would
be
like
deserting
him
on
the
eve
of
a
great
battle
she
looked
into
his
eager
hopeful
eyes
yes
it
had
always
been
so
it
always
would
be
to
the
end
not
priests
and
prophets
but
ever
that
little
scattered
band
of
glad
sufferers
for
his
sake
would
be
his
army
his
weapon
still
the
cross
till
the
victory
should
be
won
she
glanced
through
the
open
door
to
where
the
poor
broken
fellows
she
always
thought
of
as
her
boys
lay
so
patient
and
then
held
out
her
hand
to
him
with
a
smile
though
the
tears
were
in
her
eyes
so
you
like
all
the
rest
of
them
lad
she
said
it
for
king
and
country
good
luck
to
you
after
the
war
was
over
and
the
men
released
from
their
long
terms
of
solitary
confinement
came
back
to
life
injured
in
mind
and
body
she
was
almost
glad
he
had
escaped
but
at
the
time
it
filled
her
soul
with
darkness
it
was
one
noonday
he
had
been
down
to
the
tribunal
and
his
case
had
been
again
adjourned
she
was
returning
from
a
lecture
and
crossing
a
street
in
the
neighbourhood
of
the
docks
found
herself
suddenly
faced
by
an
oncoming
crowd
it
was
yelping
and
snarling
curiously
suggestive
of
a
pack
of
hungry
wolves
a
couple
of
young
soldiers
were
standing
back
against
a
wall
better
not
go
on
nurse
said
one
of
them
it
some
poor
devil
of
a
conchy
i
expect
must
have
a
damned
sight
more
pluck
than
i
should
it
was
the
fear
that
had
been
haunting
her
she
did
not
know
how
white
she
had
turned
i
think
it
is
someone
i
know
she
said
wo
you
help
me
the
crowd
gave
way
to
them
and
they
had
all
but
reached
him
he
was
hatless
and
bespattered
but
his
tender
eyes
had
neither
fear
nor
anger
in
them
she
reached
out
her
arms
and
called
to
him
another
step
and
she
would
have
been
beside
him
but
at
the
moment
a
slim
laughing
girl
darted
in
front
of
him
and
slipped
her
foot
between
his
legs
and
he
went
down
she
heard
the
joyous
yell
and
the
shrill
laughter
as
she
struggled
wildly
to
force
her
way
to
him
and
then
for
a
moment
there
was
a
space
and
a
man
with
bent
body
and
clenched
hands
was
rushing
forward
as
if
upon
a
football
field
and
there
came
a
little
sickening
thud
and
then
the
crowd
closed
in
again
her
strength
was
gone
and
she
could
only
wait
more
soldiers
had
come
up
and
were
using
their
fists
freely
and
gradually
the
crowd
retired
still
snarling
and
they
lifted
him
up
and
brought
him
to
her
there
a
chemist
shop
in
the
next
street
we
better
take
him
there
suggested
the
one
who
had
first
spoken
to
her
and
she
thanked
them
and
followed
them
they
made
a
bed
for
him
with
their
coats
upon
the
floor
and
some
of
them
kept
guard
outside
the
shop
while
one
putting
aside
the
frightened
useless
little
chemist
waited
upon
her
bringing
things
needful
while
she
cleansed
the
foulness
from
his
smooth
young
face
and
washed
the
matted
blood
from
his
fair
hair
and
closed
the
lids
upon
his
tender
eyes
and
stooping
kissed
the
cold
quiet
lips
there
had
been
whispered
talk
among
the
men
and
when
she
rose
the
one
who
had
first
spoken
to
her
came
forward
he
was
nervous
and
stood
stiffly
beg
pardon
nurse
he
said
but
we
sent
for
a
stretcher
as
the
police
do
seem
in
any
hurry
would
you
like
us
to
take
him
or
would
it
upset
him
do
you
think
if
he
knew
thank
you
she
answered
he
would
think
it
kind
of
you
i
know
she
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
being
borne
by
comrades
chapter
xvii
it
was
from
a
small
operating
hospital
in
a
village
of
the
argonne
that
she
first
saw
the
war
with
her
own
eyes
her
father
had
wished
her
to
go
arthur
death
had
stirred
in
him
the
old
puritan
blood
with
its
record
of
long
battle
for
liberty
of
conscience
if
war
claimed
to
be
master
of
a
man
soul
then
the
new
warfare
must
be
against
war
he
remembered
the
saying
of
a
frenchwoman
who
had
been
through
the
war
joan
on
her
return
from
paris
some
years
before
had
told
him
of
her
repeating
her
words
but
of
course
it
would
not
do
to
tell
the
truth
the
old
lady
had
said
or
we
should
have
our
children
growing
up
to
hate
war
i
be
lonely
and
anxious
till
you
come
back
he
said
but
that
will
have
to
be
my
part
of
the
fight
she
had
written
to
folk
no
female
nurses
were
supposed
to
be
allowed
within
the
battle
zone
but
under
pressure
of
shortage
the
french
staff
were
relaxing
the
rule
and
folk
had
pledged
himself
to
her
discretion
i
am
not
doing
you
any
kindness
he
had
written
you
will
have
to
share
the
common
hardships
and
privations
and
the
danger
is
real
if
i
did
feel
instinctively
that
underneath
your
mask
of
sweet
reasonableness
you
are
one
of
the
most
obstinate
young
women
god
ever
made
and
that
without
me
you
would
probably
get
yourself
into
a
still
worse
hole
i
have
refused
and
then
followed
a
list
of
the
things
she
was
to
be
sure
to
take
with
her
including
a
pound
or
two
of
keating
insect
powder
and
a
hint
that
it
might
save
her
trouble
if
she
had
her
hair
cut
short
there
was
but
one
other
woman
at
the
hospital
it
had
been
a
farmhouse
the
man
and
both
sons
had
been
killed
during
the
first
year
of
the
war
and
the
woman
had
asked
to
be
allowed
to
stay
on
her
name
was
madame
lelanne
she
was
useful
by
reason
of
her
great
physical
strength
she
could
take
up
a
man
as
he
lay
and
carry
him
on
her
outstretched
arms
it
was
an
expressionless
face
with
dull
eyes
that
never
changed
she
and
joan
shared
a
small
in
one
of
the
barns
joan
had
brought
with
her
a
camp
bedstead
but
the
woman
wrapping
a
blanket
round
her
would
creep
into
a
hole
she
had
made
for
herself
among
the
hay
she
never
took
off
her
clothes
except
the
great
boots
so
far
as
joan
could
discover
the
medical
staff
consisted
of
a
poujoulet
and
two
assistants
the
authorities
were
always
promising
to
send
him
more
help
but
it
never
arrived
one
of
the
assistants
a
monsieur
dubos
a
little
man
with
a
remarkably
big
beard
was
a
chemist
who
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
had
been
on
the
verge
as
he
made
sure
of
an
important
discovery
in
connection
with
colour
photography
almost
the
first
question
he
asked
joan
was
could
she
speak
german
finding
that
she
could
he
had
hurried
her
across
the
yard
into
a
small
hut
where
patients
who
had
borne
their
operation
successfully
awaited
their
turn
to
be
moved
down
to
one
of
the
convalescent
hospitals
at
the
base
among
them
was
a
german
prisoner
an
elderly
man
belonging
to
the
landwehr
in
private
life
a
photographer
he
also
had
been
making
experiments
in
the
direction
of
colour
photography
chance
had
revealed
to
the
two
men
their
common
interest
and
they
had
been
exchanging
notes
the
german
talked
a
little
french
but
not
sufficient
and
on
the
day
of
joan
arrival
they
had
reached
an
impasse
that
was
maddening
to
both
of
them
joan
found
herself
up
against
technical
terms
that
rendered
her
task
difficult
but
fortunately
had
brought
a
dictionary
with
her
and
was
able
to
make
them
understand
one
another
but
she
had
to
be
firm
with
both
of
them
allowing
them
only
ten
minutes
together
at
a
time
the
little
frenchman
would
kneel
by
the
bedside
holding
the
german
at
an
angle
where
he
could
talk
with
least
danger
to
his
wound
it
seemed
that
each
was
the
very
man
the
other
had
been
waiting
all
his
life
to
meet
they
shed
tears
on
one
another
neck
when
they
parted
making
all
arrangements
to
write
to
one
another
and
you
will
come
and
stay
with
me
persisted
the
little
frenchman
when
this
affair
is
finished
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
with
his
hands
my
wife
takes
much
interest
she
will
be
delighted
and
the
big
german
again
embracing
the
little
frenchman
had
promised
and
had
sent
his
compliments
to
madame
the
other
was
a
young
priest
he
wore
the
regulation
red
cross
uniform
but
kept
his
cassock
hanging
on
a
peg
behind
his
bed
he
had
pretty
frequent
occasion
to
take
it
down
these
small
emergency
hospitals
within
range
of
the
guns
were
reserved
for
only
dangerous
cases
men
whose
wounds
would
not
permit
of
their
being
carried
further
and
there
never
was
much
more
than
a
sporting
chance
of
saving
them
they
were
always
glad
to
find
there
was
a
priest
among
the
staff
often
it
was
the
first
question
they
would
ask
on
being
lifted
out
of
the
ambulance
even
those
who
professed
to
no
religion
seemed
comforted
by
the
idea
he
went
by
the
title
of
monsieur
le
pretre
joan
never
learned
his
name
it
was
he
who
had
laid
out
the
little
cemetery
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
village
street
it
had
once
been
an
orchard
and
some
of
the
trees
were
still
standing
in
the
centre
rising
out
of
a
pile
of
rockwork
he
had
placed
a
crucifix
that
had
been
found
upon
the
roadside
and
had
surrounded
it
with
flowers
it
formed
the
one
bright
spot
of
colour
in
the
village
and
at
night
time
when
all
other
sounds
were
hushed
the
iron
wreaths
upon
its
little
crosses
swaying
against
one
another
in
the
wind
would
make
a
low
clear
tinkling
music
joan
would
sometimes
lie
awake
listening
to
it
in
some
way
she
could
not
explain
it
always
brought
the
thought
of
children
to
her
mind
the
doctor
himself
was
a
man
clean
shaven
with
bristly
hair
he
had
curiously
square
hands
with
short
squat
fingers
he
had
been
head
surgeon
in
one
of
the
paris
hospitals
and
had
been
assigned
his
present
post
because
of
his
marvellous
quickness
with
the
knife
the
hospital
was
the
nearest
to
a
hill
of
great
strategical
importance
and
the
fighting
in
the
neighbourhood
was
almost
continuous
often
a
single
ambulance
would
bring
in
three
or
four
cases
each
one
demanding
instant
attention
poujoulet
with
his
hairy
arms
bare
to
the
shoulder
would
polish
them
off
one
after
another
with
hardly
a
moment
rest
between
not
allowing
time
even
for
the
washing
of
the
table
joan
would
have
to
summon
all
her
nerve
to
keep
herself
from
collapsing
at
times
the
need
for
haste
was
such
that
it
was
impossible
to
wait
for
the
anaesthetic
to
take
effect
the
one
redeeming
feature
was
the
extraordinary
heroism
of
the
men
though
occasionally
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
call
in
the
orderlies
to
hold
some
poor
fellow
down
and
to
deafen
one
ears
one
day
after
a
successful
operation
she
was
tending
a
young
sergeant
he
was
a
handsome
man
with
skin
as
white
as
a
woman
he
watched
her
with
curious
indifference
in
his
eyes
as
she
busied
herself
trying
to
make
him
comfortable
and
did
nothing
to
help
her
has
ever
seen
a
bull
fight
he
asked
her
no
she
answered
i
seen
all
the
horror
and
cruelty
i
want
to
for
the
rest
of
my
life
ah
he
said
you
would
understand
if
you
had
when
one
of
the
horses
goes
down
gored
his
entrails
lying
out
upon
the
sand
you
know
what
they
do
do
you
they
put
a
rope
round
him
and
drag
him
groaning
into
the
shambles
behind
and
once
there
kind
people
like
you
and
monsieur
le
medecin
tend
him
and
wash
him
and
put
his
entrails
back
and
sew
him
up
again
he
thinks
it
so
kind
of
them
the
first
time
but
the
second
he
understands
he
will
be
sent
back
into
the
arena
to
be
ripped
up
again
and
again
after
that
this
is
the
third
time
i
have
been
wounded
and
as
soon
as
you
all
patched
me
up
and
i
got
my
breath
again
they
send
me
back
into
it
will
forgive
my
not
feeling
grateful
to
her
he
gave
a
short
laugh
that
brought
the
blood
into
his
mouth
the
village
consisted
of
one
long
straggling
street
following
the
course
of
a
small
stream
between
two
lines
of
hills
it
was
on
one
of
the
great
lines
of
communication
and
troops
and
war
material
passed
through
it
going
and
coming
in
almost
endless
procession
it
served
also
as
a
camp
of
rest
companies
from
the
trenches
would
arrive
there
generally
towards
the
evening
weary
listless
many
of
them
staggering
like
cattle
beneath
their
mass
of
burdens
they
would
fling
their
accoutrements
from
them
and
stand
in
silent
groups
till
the
sergeants
and
corporals
returned
to
lead
them
to
the
barns
and
that
had
been
assigned
to
them
the
houses
still
habitable
being
mostly
reserved
for
the
officers
like
those
of
most
french
villages
they
were
drab
buildings
without
gardens
but
some
of
them
were
covered
with
vines
hiding
their
ugliness
and
the
village
as
a
whole
with
its
groups
here
and
there
of
fine
sycamore
trees
and
its
great
stone
fountain
in
the
centre
was
picturesque
enough
it
had
twice
changed
hands
and
a
part
of
it
was
in
ruins
from
one
or
two
of
the
more
solidly
built
houses
merely
the
front
had
fallen
leaving
the
rooms
just
as
they
had
always
been
the
furniture
in
its
accustomed
place
the
pictures
on
the
walls
they
suggested
doll
houses
standing
open
one
wondered
when
the
giant
child
would
come
along
and
close
them
up
the
iron
spire
of
the
little
church
had
been
hit
twice
it
stood
above
the
village
twisted
into
the
form
of
a
note
of
interrogation
in
the
churchyard
many
of
the
graves
had
been
ripped
open
bones
and
skulls
lay
scattered
about
among
the
shattered
tombstones
but
save
for
a
couple
of
holes
in
the
roof
the
body
was
still
intact
and
every
afternoon
a
faint
bell
called
a
few
villagers
and
a
sprinkling
of
soldiers
to
mass
most
of
the
inhabitants
had
fled
but
the
farmers
and
shopkeepers
had
remained
at
intervals
the
german
batteries
searching
round
with
apparent
aimlessness
would
drop
a
score
or
so
of
shells
about
the
neighbourhood
but
the
peasant
with
an
indifference
that
was
almost
animal
would
still
follow
his
plough
the
old
bent
crone
muttering
curses
still
ply
the
hoe
the
proprietors
of
the
tiny
must
have
been
rapidly
making
their
fortunes
considering
the
prices
that
they
charged
the
unfortunate
dreaming
of
some
small
luxury
out
of
his
five
sous
a
day
but
as
one
of
them
a
stout
smiling
lady
explained
to
joan
with
a
gesture
it
is
not
often
that
one
has
a
war
joan
had
gone
out
in
september
and
for
a
while
the
weather
was
pleasant
the
men
wrapped
up
in
their
would
sleep
for
preference
under
the
great
sycamore
trees
through
open
doorways
she
would
catch
glimpses
of
picturesque
groups
of
eager
crowded
round
a
flickering
candle
from
the
darkness
there
would
steal
the
sound
of
flute
or
zither
of
voices
singing
occasionally
it
would
be
some
strident
ditty
of
the
paris
but
more
often
it
was
sad
and
plaintive
but
early
in
october
the
rains
commenced
and
the
stream
became
a
roaring
torrent
and
a
clammy
mist
lay
like
a
white
river
between
the
wooded
hills
mud
that
seemed
to
be
the
one
word
with
which
to
describe
modern
war
mud
everywhere
mud
upon
the
roads
mud
into
which
you
sank
up
to
your
knees
the
moment
you
stepped
off
it
tents
and
huts
to
which
you
waded
through
the
mud
avoiding
the
slimy
gangways
on
which
you
slipped
and
fell
men
horses
little
donkeys
looking
as
if
they
had
been
sculptured
out
of
mud
struggling
up
and
down
the
light
railways
that
every
now
and
then
would
disappear
and
be
lost
beneath
the
mud
guns
and
wagons
groaning
through
the
mud
lorries
and
ambulances
that
in
the
darkness
had
swerved
from
the
straight
course
overturned
and
lying
abandoned
in
the
mud
ploughing
swift
furrows
through
the
mud
rolling
it
back
in
liquid
streams
each
side
of
them
staff
cars
rushing
screaming
through
the
mud
followed
by
a
rushing
fountain
of
mud
serried
ranks
of
muddy
men
stamping
through
the
mud
with
steady
rhythm
moving
through
a
rain
of
mud
rising
upward
from
the
ground
long
lines
of
filled
with
a
mass
of
muddy
humanity
packed
shoulder
to
shoulder
rumbling
ever
through
the
endless
mud
men
sitting
by
the
roadside
in
the
mud
gnawing
at
unsavoury
food
men
squatting
by
the
ditches
examining
their
sores
washing
their
bleeding
feet
in
the
muddy
water
replacing
the
muddy
rags
about
their
wounds
a
world
without
colour
no
other
colour
to
be
seen
beneath
the
sky
but
mud
the
very
buttons
on
the
men
coats
painted
to
make
them
look
like
mud
mud
and
dirt
dirty
faces
dirty
hands
dirty
clothes
dirty
food
dirty
beds
dirty
interiors
from
which
there
was
never
time
to
wash
the
mud
dirty
linen
hanging
up
to
dry
beneath
which
dirty
children
played
while
dirty
women
scolded
filth
and
desolation
all
around
shattered
farmsteads
half
buried
in
the
mud
shattered
gardens
trampled
into
mud
a
weary
land
of
foulness
breeding
foulness
tangled
wire
the
only
harvest
of
the
fields
mile
after
mile
of
gaping
holes
filled
with
muddy
water
stinking
carcases
of
dead
horses
birds
of
prey
clinging
to
broken
fences
flapping
their
great
wings
a
land
where
man
died
and
vermin
increased
and
multiplied
vermin
on
your
body
vermin
in
your
head
vermin
in
your
food
vermin
waiting
for
you
in
your
bed
vermin
the
only
thing
that
throve
the
only
thing
that
looked
at
you
with
bright
eyes
vermin
the
only
thing
to
which
the
joy
of
life
had
still
been
left
joan
had
found
a
liking
gradually
growing
up
in
her
for
the
doctor
she
had
dismissed
him
at
first
as
a
mere
butcher
his
brutal
haste
his
indifference
apparently
to
the
suffering
he
was
causing
his
great
strong
hairy
hands
with
their
squat
fingers
his
cold
grey
eyes
but
she
learnt
as
time
went
by
that
his
callousness
was
a
thing
that
he
put
on
at
the
same
time
that
he
tied
his
white
apron
round
his
waist
and
rolled
up
his
sleeves
she
was
resting
after
a
morning
of
grim
work
on
a
bench
outside
the
hospital
struggling
with
clenched
quivering
hands
against
a
craving
to
fling
herself
upon
the
ground
and
sob
and
he
had
found
her
there
and
had
sat
down
beside
her
so
you
wanted
to
see
it
with
your
own
eyes
he
said
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
she
had
some
difficulty
in
not
catching
hold
of
him
and
clinging
to
him
she
was
feeling
absurdly
womanish
just
at
that
moment
yes
she
answered
and
i
glad
that
i
did
it
she
added
defiantly
so
am
i
he
said
tell
your
children
what
you
have
seen
tell
other
women
it
you
women
that
make
war
he
continued
oh
i
do
mean
that
you
do
it
on
purpose
but
it
in
your
blood
it
comes
from
the
days
when
to
live
it
was
needful
to
kill
when
a
man
who
was
swift
and
strong
to
kill
was
the
only
thing
that
could
save
a
woman
and
her
brood
every
other
man
that
crept
towards
them
through
the
grass
was
an
enemy
and
her
only
hope
was
that
her
man
might
kill
him
while
she
watched
and
waited
and
later
came
the
tribe
and
instead
of
the
one
man
creeping
through
the
grass
the
everlasting
warfare
was
against
all
other
tribes
so
you
loved
only
the
men
ever
ready
and
willing
to
fight
lest
you
and
your
children
should
be
carried
into
slavery
then
it
was
the
only
way
you
brought
up
your
boys
to
be
fighters
you
told
them
stories
of
their
gallant
sires
you
sang
to
them
the
songs
of
battle
the
glory
of
killing
and
of
conquering
you
have
never
unlearnt
the
lesson
man
has
learnt
comradeship
would
have
travelled
further
but
for
you
but
woman
is
still
primitive
she
would
still
have
her
man
the
hater
and
the
killer
to
the
woman
the
world
has
never
changed
tell
the
other
women
he
said
open
their
eyes
tell
them
of
their
sons
that
you
have
seen
dead
and
dying
in
the
foolish
quarrel
for
which
there
was
no
need
tell
them
of
the
foulness
of
the
cruelty
of
the
senselessness
of
it
all
set
the
women
against
war
that
is
the
only
way
to
end
it
it
was
a
morning
or
two
later
that
knocking
at
the
door
of
her
loft
he
asked
her
if
she
would
care
to
come
with
him
to
the
trenches
he
had
brought
an
outfit
for
her
which
he
handed
to
her
with
a
grin
she
had
followed
folk
advice
and
had
cut
her
hair
and
when
she
appeared
before
him
for
inspection
in
trousers
and
overcoat
the
collar
turned
up
about
her
neck
and
reaching
to
her
helmet
he
had
laughingly
pronounced
the
experiment
safe
a
motor
carried
them
to
where
the
road
ended
and
from
there
a
little
ambulance
took
them
on
to
almost
the
last
trees
of
the
forest
there
was
no
life
to
be
seen
anywhere
during
the
last
mile
they
had
passed
through
a
continuous
double
line
of
graves
here
and
there
a
group
of
tiny
crosses
keeping
one
another
company
others
standing
singly
looking
strangely
lonesome
amid
the
earth
and
shattered
trees
but
even
these
had
ceased
death
itself
seemed
to
have
been
frightened
away
from
this
desert
looking
down
she
could
see
thin
wreaths
of
smoke
rising
from
the
ground
from
underneath
her
feet
there
came
a
low
faint
ceaseless
murmur
quick
said
the
doctor
he
pushed
her
in
front
of
him
and
she
almost
fell
down
a
flight
of
steps
that
led
into
the
earth
she
found
herself
in
a
long
low
gallery
lighted
by
a
dim
oil
lamp
suspended
from
the
blackened
roof
a
shelf
ran
along
one
side
of
it
covered
with
straw
three
men
lay
there
the
straw
was
soaked
with
their
blood
they
had
been
brought
in
the
night
before
by
the
bearers
a
young
surgeon
was
rearranging
their
splints
and
bandages
and
redressing
their
wounds
they
would
lie
there
for
another
hour
or
so
and
then
start
for
their
twenty
kilometre
drive
over
roads
to
one
or
another
of
the
great
hospitals
at
the
base
while
she
was
there
two
more
cases
were
brought
in
the
doctor
gave
but
a
glance
at
the
first
one
and
then
made
a
sign
and
the
bearers
passed
on
with
him
to
the
further
end
of
the
gallery
he
seemed
to
understand
for
he
gave
a
low
despairing
cry
and
the
tears
sprang
to
his
eyes
he
was
but
a
boy
the
other
had
a
foot
torn
off
one
of
the
orderlies
gave
him
two
round
pieces
of
wood
to
hold
in
his
hands
while
the
young
surgeon
cut
away
the
hanging
flesh
and
bound
up
the
stump
the
doctor
had
been
whispering
to
one
of
the
bearers
he
had
the
face
of
an
old
man
but
his
shoulders
were
broad
and
he
looked
sturdy
he
nodded
and
beckoned
joan
to
follow
him
up
the
slippery
steps
it
is
breakfast
time
he
explained
as
they
emerged
into
the
air
we
leave
each
other
alone
for
half
an
hour
even
the
snipers
but
we
must
be
careful
she
followed
in
his
footsteps
stooping
so
low
that
her
hands
could
have
touched
the
ground
they
had
to
be
sure
that
they
did
not
step
off
the
narrow
track
marked
with
white
stones
lest
they
should
be
drowned
in
the
mud
they
passed
the
head
of
a
dead
horse
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
cut
off
and
laid
there
the
body
was
below
it
in
the
mud
they
spoke
in
whispers
and
joan
at
first
had
made
an
effort
to
disguise
her
voice
but
her
conductor
had
smiled
they
shall
be
called
the
brothers
and
the
sisters
of
the
lord
he
had
said
mademoiselle
is
brave
for
her
brothers
sake
he
was
a
priest
there
were
many
priests
among
the
crouching
close
to
the
ground
behind
the
spreading
roots
of
a
giant
oak
she
raised
her
eyes
before
her
lay
a
sea
of
smooth
soft
mud
nearly
a
mile
wide
from
the
centre
rose
a
solitary
tree
from
which
all
had
been
shot
away
but
two
bare
branches
like
outstretched
arms
above
the
silence
beyond
the
hills
rose
again
there
was
something
unearthly
in
the
silence
that
seemed
to
brood
above
that
sea
of
mud
the
old
priest
told
her
of
the
living
men
french
and
german
who
had
stood
there
day
and
night
sunk
in
it
up
to
their
waists
screaming
hour
after
hour
and
waving
their
arms
sinking
into
it
lower
and
lower
none
able
to
help
them
until
at
last
only
their
screaming
heads
were
left
and
after
a
time
these
too
would
disappear
and
the
silence
come
again
she
saw
the
ditches
like
long
graves
dug
for
the
living
where
the
weary
listless
men
stood
in
mud
hoping
for
wounds
that
would
relieve
them
from
the
ghastly
monotony
of
their
existence
the
holes
of
muddy
water
where
the
dead
things
lay
to
which
they
crept
out
in
the
night
to
wash
a
little
of
the
filth
from
their
clammy
bodies
and
their
stinking
clothes
the
holes
dug
out
of
the
mud
in
which
they
ate
and
slept
and
lived
year
after
year
till
brain
and
heart
and
soul
seemed
to
have
died
out
of
them
and
they
remembered
with
an
effort
that
they
once
were
men
after
a
time
the
care
of
the
convalescents
passed
almost
entirely
into
joan
hands
madame
lelanne
being
told
off
to
assist
her
by
dint
of
much
persistence
she
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
leaky
roof
repaired
and
in
place
of
the
smoky
stove
that
had
long
been
her
despair
she
had
one
night
procured
a
fine
calorifere
by
the
simple
process
of
stealing
it
madame
lelanne
had
heard
about
it
from
the
gossips
it
had
been
brought
to
a
lonely
house
at
the
end
of
the
village
by
a
major
of
engineers
he
had
returned
to
the
trenches
the
day
before
and
the
place
for
the
time
being
was
empty
the
thieves
were
never
discovered
the
sentry
was
positive
that
no
one
had
passed
him
but
two
women
one
of
them
carrying
a
baby
madame
lelanne
had
dressed
it
up
in
a
child
cloak
and
hood
and
had
carried
it
in
her
arms
as
it
must
have
weighed
nearly
a
couple
of
suspicion
had
not
attached
to
them
space
did
not
allow
of
any
separation
broken
frenchmen
and
broken
germans
would
often
lie
side
by
side
joan
would
wonder
with
a
grim
smile
to
herself
what
the
patriotic
press
of
the
different
countries
would
have
thought
had
they
been
there
to
have
overheard
the
conversations
neither
france
nor
germany
appeared
to
be
the
enemy
but
a
thing
called
they
a
mysterious
power
that
worked
its
will
upon
them
both
from
a
place
they
always
spoke
of
as
back
there
one
day
the
talk
fell
on
courage
a
young
french
soldier
was
holding
forth
when
joan
entered
the
hut
it
makes
me
laugh
he
was
saying
all
this
newspaper
talk
every
nation
properly
led
fights
bravely
it
is
the
male
instinct
women
go
into
hysterics
about
it
because
it
has
not
been
given
them
i
have
the
croix
de
guerre
with
all
three
leaves
and
i
have
half
the
courage
of
my
dog
who
weighs
twelve
kilos
and
would
face
a
regiment
by
himself
why
a
game
cock
has
got
more
than
the
best
of
us
it
the
man
who
does
think
who
ca
think
who
has
the
most
courage
who
imagines
nothing
but
just
goes
forward
with
his
head
down
like
a
bull
there
is
of
course
a
real
courage
when
you
are
by
yourself
and
have
to
do
something
in
cold
blood
but
the
courage
required
for
rushing
forward
shouting
and
yelling
with
a
lot
of
other
fellows
why
it
would
take
a
hundred
times
more
pluck
to
turn
back
they
know
that
chimed
in
the
man
lying
next
to
him
or
they
would
not
drug
us
why
when
we
stormed
la
haye
i
knew
nothing
until
an
german
spat
a
pint
of
blood
into
my
face
and
woke
me
up
a
sergeant
who
had
a
wound
in
the
stomach
and
was
sitting
up
in
his
bed
looked
across
there
was
a
line
of
germans
came
upon
us
he
said
at
bras
i
thought
i
must
be
suffering
from
a
nightmare
when
i
saw
them
they
had
thrown
away
their
rifles
and
had
all
joined
hands
they
came
dancing
towards
us
just
like
a
row
of
ballet
girls
they
were
shrieking
and
laughing
and
they
never
attempted
to
do
anything
we
just
waited
until
they
were
close
up
and
then
shot
them
down
it
was
like
killing
a
lot
of
kids
who
had
come
to
have
a
game
with
us
the
one
i
potted
got
his
arms
round
me
before
he
coughed
himself
out
calling
me
his
elsa
and
wanting
to
kiss
me
lord
you
can
guess
how
the
boche
spread
themselves
over
that
business
colossal
unvergessliche
helden
poor
devils
they
give
us
ginger
before
it
is
over
said
another
he
had
had
both
his
lips
torn
away
and
appeared
to
be
always
laughing
stuff
it
into
us
as
if
we
were
horses
at
a
fair
that
will
make
us
run
forward
right
enough
oh
come
struck
in
a
youngster
who
was
lying
perfectly
flat
face
downwards
on
his
bed
it
was
the
position
in
which
he
could
breathe
easiest
he
raised
his
head
a
couple
of
inches
and
twisted
it
round
so
as
to
get
his
mouth
free
it
is
as
bad
as
all
that
why
the
third
swarmed
into
fort
malmaison
of
their
own
accord
though
was
like
jumping
into
a
boiling
furnace
and
held
it
for
three
days
against
pretty
nearly
a
division
there
were
a
dozen
of
them
left
when
we
relieved
them
they
had
no
ammunition
left
they
just
been
filling
up
the
gaps
with
their
bodies
and
they
would
go
back
even
then
we
had
to
drag
them
away
sha
pass
sha
pass
that
all
they
kept
saying
his
voice
had
sunk
to
a
thin
whisper
a
young
officer
was
lying
in
a
corner
behind
a
screen
he
leant
forward
and
pushed
it
aside
oh
give
the
devil
his
due
you
fellows
he
said
war
is
a
pretty
game
but
it
does
make
for
courage
we
all
know
that
and
things
even
finer
than
mere
fighting
pluck
there
was
a
man
in
my
company
a
jacques
decrusy
he
was
just
a
stupid
peasant
lad
we
were
crowded
into
one
end
of
the
trench
about
a
score
of
us
the
rest
of
it
had
fallen
in
and
we
could
move
and
a
bomb
dropped
into
the
middle
of
us
and
the
same
instant
that
it
touched
the
ground
decrusy
threw
himself
flat
down
upon
it
and
took
the
whole
of
it
into
his
body
there
was
nothing
left
of
him
but
scraps
but
the
rest
of
us
got
off
nobody
had
drugged
him
to
do
that
there
is
one
of
us
who
was
in
that
trench
that
will
not
be
a
better
man
to
the
end
of
his
days
remembering
how
jacques
decrusy
gave
his
life
for
ours
i
grant
you
all
that
sir
answered
the
young
soldier
who
had
first
spoken
he
had
long
delicate
hands
and
eager
restless
eyes
war
does
bring
out
heroism
so
does
pestilence
and
famine
read
defoe
account
of
the
plague
of
london
how
men
and
women
left
their
safe
homes
to
serve
in
the
knowing
that
sooner
or
later
they
were
doomed
read
of
the
mothers
in
india
who
die
of
slow
starvation
never
allowing
a
morsel
of
food
to
pass
their
lips
so
that
they
may
save
up
their
own
small
daily
portion
to
add
it
to
their
children
why
do
we
pray
to
god
not
to
withhold
from
us
his
precious
medicine
of
pestilence
and
famine
so
is
shipwreck
a
fine
school
for
courage
look
at
the
chance
it
gives
the
captain
to
set
a
fine
example
and
the
engineers
who
stick
to
their
post
with
the
water
pouring
in
upon
them
we
do
reconcile
ourselves
to
shipwrecks
as
a
necessary
school
for
sailors
we
do
our
best
to
lessen
them
so
did
persecution
bring
out
heroism
it
made
saints
and
martyrs
why
have
we
done
away
with
it
if
this
game
of
killing
and
being
killed
is
the
fine
school
for
virtue
it
is
made
out
to
be
then
all
our
efforts
towards
law
and
order
have
been
a
mistake
we
never
ought
to
have
emerged
from
the
jungle
he
took
a
from
under
his
pillow
and
commenced
to
scribble
an
man
spoke
he
lay
with
his
arms
folded
across
his
breast
addressing
apparently
the
smoky
rafters
he
was
a
russian
a
teacher
of
languages
in
paris
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
and
had
joined
the
french
army
it
is
not
only
courage
he
said
that
war
brings
out
it
brings
out
vile
things
too
oh
i
not
thinking
merely
of
the
boches
that
the
cant
of
every
nation
that
all
the
heroism
is
on
one
side
and
all
the
brutality
on
the
other
take
men
from
anywhere
and
some
of
them
will
be
devils
war
gives
them
their
opportunity
brings
out
the
beast
can
you
wonder
at
it
you
teach
a
man
to
plunge
a
bayonet
into
the
writhing
flesh
of
a
fellow
human
being
and
twist
it
round
and
round
and
jamb
it
further
in
while
the
blood
is
spurting
from
him
like
a
fountain
what
are
you
making
of
him
but
a
beast
a
man
got
to
be
a
beast
before
he
can
bring
himself
to
do
it
i
have
seen
things
done
by
our
own
men
in
cold
blood
the
horror
of
which
will
haunt
my
memory
until
i
die
but
of
course
we
hush
it
up
when
it
happens
to
be
our
own
people
he
ceased
speaking
no
one
seemed
inclined
to
break
the
silence
they
remained
confused
in
her
memory
these
talks
among
the
wounded
men
in
the
low
dimly
lighted
hut
that
had
become
her
world
at
times
it
was
but
two
men
speaking
to
one
another
in
whispers
at
others
every
creaking
bed
would
be
drawn
into
the
argument
one
topic
that
never
lost
its
interest
was
who
made
wars
who
hounded
the
people
into
them
and
kept
them
there
tearing
at
one
throats
they
never
settled
it
god
knows
i
did
want
it
speaking
personally
said
a
german
prisoner
one
day
with
a
laugh
i
had
been
working
at
a
printing
business
sixteen
hours
a
day
for
seven
years
it
was
just
beginning
to
pay
me
and
now
my
wife
writes
me
that
she
has
had
to
shut
the
place
up
and
sell
the
machinery
to
keep
them
all
from
starving
but
could
you
have
done
anything
to
stop
it
demanded
a
frenchman
lying
next
to
him
all
your
millions
of
socialists
what
were
they
up
to
what
went
wrong
with
the
internationale
the
universal
brotherhood
of
labour
and
all
that
the
german
laughed
again
oh
they
know
their
business
he
answered
you
have
your
glass
of
beer
and
go
to
bed
and
when
you
wake
up
in
the
morning
you
find
that
war
has
been
declared
and
you
keep
your
mouth
shut
unless
you
want
to
be
shot
for
a
traitor
not
that
it
would
have
made
much
difference
he
added
i
admit
that
the
ground
had
been
too
well
prepared
england
was
envious
of
our
trade
king
edward
had
been
plotting
our
destruction
our
papers
were
full
of
translations
from
yours
talking
about
we
were
told
that
you
had
been
lending
money
to
russia
to
enable
her
to
build
railways
and
that
when
they
were
complete
france
and
russia
would
fall
upon
us
suddenly
fatherland
in
danger
it
may
be
lies
or
it
may
not
what
is
one
to
do
what
would
you
have
done
even
if
you
could
have
done
anything
he
right
said
a
looking
man
laying
down
the
book
he
had
been
reading
we
should
have
done
just
the
same
country
right
or
wrong
after
all
it
is
an
ideal
a
dark
man
raised
himself
painfully
upon
his
elbow
he
was
a
tailor
in
the
rue
parnesse
and
prided
himself
on
a
decided
resemblance
to
victor
hugo
it
a
noble
ideal
he
said
the
great
mother
right
or
wrong
who
shall
dare
to
harm
her
yes
if
it
was
she
who
rose
up
in
her
majesty
and
called
to
us
he
laughed
what
does
it
mean
in
reality
germania
italia
la
france
britannia
half
a
score
of
pompous
old
muddlers
with
their
fat
wives
egging
them
on
sons
of
the
fools
before
them
talkers
who
have
wormed
themselves
into
power
by
making
frothy
speeches
and
fine
promises
my
country
he
laughed
again
look
at
them
ca
you
see
their
swelling
paunches
and
their
flabby
faces
half
a
score
of
ambitious
politicians
gouty
old
financiers
old
toffs
with
their
waxed
moustaches
and
false
teeth
that
what
we
mean
when
we
talk
about
country
a
pack
of
selfish
soulless
headed
old
men
and
whether
they
right
or
whether
they
wrong
our
duty
is
to
fight
at
their
bidding
to
bleed
for
them
to
die
for
them
that
they
may
grow
more
sleek
and
prosperous
he
sank
back
on
his
pillow
with
another
laugh
sometimes
they
agreed
it
was
the
newspapers
that
made
war
that
fanned
every
trivial
difference
into
a
vital
question
of
national
honour
that
whenever
there
was
any
fear
of
peace
the
fires
of
hatred
with
their
stories
of
atrocities
at
other
times
they
decided
it
was
the
capitalists
the
traders
scenting
profit
for
themselves
some
held
it
was
the
politicians
dreaming
of
going
down
to
history
as
richelieus
or
as
bismarcks
a
popular
theory
was
that
cause
for
war
was
always
discovered
by
the
ruling
classes
whenever
there
seemed
danger
that
the
workers
were
getting
out
of
hand
in
war
you
put
the
common
people
back
in
their
place
revived
in
them
the
habits
of
submission
and
obedience
napoleon
the
little
it
was
argued
had
started
the
war
of
with
that
idea
russia
had
welcomed
the
present
war
as
an
answer
to
the
revolution
that
was
threatening
czardom
others
contended
it
was
the
great
munition
industries
aided
by
the
military
party
the
officers
impatient
for
opportunities
of
advancement
the
strategists
eager
to
put
their
theories
to
the
test
a
few
of
the
more
philosophical
shrugged
their
shoulders
it
was
the
thing
itself
that
sooner
or
later
was
bound
to
go
off
of
its
own
accord
half
every
country
energy
half
every
country
time
and
money
was
spent
in
piling
up
explosives
in
every
country
envy
and
hatred
of
every
other
country
was
preached
as
a
religion
they
called
it
patriotism
sooner
or
later
the
spark
fell
a
wizened
little
man
had
been
listening
to
it
all
one
day
he
had
a
curiously
face
with
round
red
twinkling
eyes
and
a
long
pointed
nose
that
twitched
as
he
talked
i
tell
you
who
makes
all
the
wars
he
said
it
you
and
me
my
dears
we
make
the
wars
we
love
them
that
why
we
open
our
mouths
and
swallow
all
the
twaddle
that
the
papers
give
us
and
cheer
the
fine
gentlemen
when
they
tell
us
it
our
sacred
duty
to
kill
germans
or
italians
or
russians
or
anybody
else
we
are
just
crazy
to
kill
something
it
does
matter
what
if
it
to
be
germans
we
shout
and
if
it
to
be
russians
we
cheer
for
liberty
i
was
in
paris
at
the
time
of
the
fashoda
trouble
how
we
hissed
the
english
in
the
cafes
and
how
they
glared
back
at
us
they
were
just
as
eager
to
kill
us
who
makes
a
dog
fight
why
the
dog
anybody
can
do
it
who
could
make
us
fight
each
other
if
we
did
want
to
not
all
the
horses
and
all
the
king
men
no
my
dears
it
we
make
the
wars
you
and
me
my
dears
there
came
a
day
in
early
spring
all
night
long
the
guns
had
never
ceased
it
sounded
like
the
tireless
barking
of
ten
thousand
giant
dogs
behind
the
hills
the
whole
horizon
like
a
fiery
circle
was
ringed
with
flashing
light
shapeless
forms
bent
beneath
burdens
passed
in
endless
procession
through
the
village
masses
of
rushing
men
swept
like
shadowy
phantoms
through
the
darkness
beneath
that
everlasting
barking
joan
would
hear
now
the
piercing
wail
of
a
child
now
a
clap
of
thunder
that
for
the
moment
would
drown
all
other
sounds
followed
by
a
faint
low
rumbling
crash
like
the
shooting
of
coals
into
a
cellar
the
wounded
on
their
beds
lay
with
terrified
eyes
moving
feverishly
from
side
to
side
at
dawn
the
order
came
that
the
hospital
was
to
be
evacuated
the
ambulances
were
already
waiting
in
the
street
joan
flew
up
the
ladder
to
her
loft
the
other
side
of
the
yard
madame
lelanne
was
already
there
she
had
thrown
a
few
things
into
a
bundle
and
her
foot
was
again
upon
the
ladder
when
it
seemed
to
her
that
someone
struck
her
hurling
her
back
upon
the
floor
and
the
house
the
other
side
of
the
yard
rose
up
into
the
air
and
then
fell
quite
slowly
and
a
cloud
of
dust
hid
it
from
her
sight
madame
lelanne
must
have
carried
her
down
the
ladder
she
was
standing
in
the
yard
and
the
dust
was
choking
her
across
the
street
beyond
the
ruins
of
the
hospital
swarms
of
men
were
running
about
like
ants
when
their
nest
has
been
disturbed
some
were
running
this
way
and
some
that
and
then
they
would
turn
and
run
back
again
making
dancing
movements
round
one
another
and
jostling
one
another
the
guns
had
ceased
and
instead
it
sounded
as
if
all
the
babies
in
the
world
were
playing
with
their
rattles
suddenly
madame
lelanne
reappeared
out
of
the
dust
and
seizing
joan
dragged
her
through
a
dark
opening
and
down
a
flight
of
steps
and
then
left
her
she
was
in
a
great
vaulted
cellar
a
faint
light
crept
in
through
a
grated
window
at
the
other
end
there
was
a
long
table
against
the
wall
and
in
front
of
it
a
bench
she
staggered
to
it
and
sat
down
leaning
against
the
damp
wall
the
place
was
very
silent
suddenly
she
began
to
laugh
she
tried
to
stop
herself
but
could
and
then
she
heard
footsteps
descending
and
her
memory
came
back
to
her
with
a
rush
they
were
german
footsteps
she
felt
sure
by
the
sound
they
were
so
slow
and
heavy
they
should
not
find
her
in
hysterics
anyhow
she
fixed
her
teeth
into
the
wooden
table
in
front
of
her
and
held
on
to
it
with
clenched
hands
she
had
recovered
herself
before
the
footsteps
had
finished
their
descent
with
a
relief
that
made
it
difficult
for
her
not
to
begin
laughing
again
she
found
it
was
madame
lelanne
and
monsieur
dubos
they
were
carrying
something
between
them
she
hardly
recognized
dubos
at
first
his
beard
was
gone
and
a
line
of
flaming
scars
had
taken
its
place
they
laid
their
burden
on
the
table
it
was
one
of
the
wounded
men
from
the
hut
they
told
her
they
were
bringing
down
two
more
the
hut
itself
had
not
been
hit
but
the
roof
had
been
torn
off
by
the
force
of
the
explosion
and
the
others
had
been
killed
by
the
falling
beams
joan
wanted
to
return
with
them
but
madame
lelanne
had
assumed
an
air
of
authority
and
told
her
she
would
be
more
useful
where
she
was
from
the
top
of
the
steps
they
threw
down
bundles
of
straw
on
which
they
laid
the
wounded
men
and
joan
tended
them
while
madame
lelanne
and
the
little
chemist
went
up
and
down
continuously
before
evening
the
place
considering
all
things
was
fairly
habitable
madame
lelanne
brought
down
the
great
stove
from
the
hut
and
breaking
a
pane
of
glass
in
the
barred
window
they
fixed
it
up
with
its
chimney
and
lighted
it
from
time
to
time
the
turmoil
above
them
would
break
out
again
the
rattling
and
sometimes
a
dull
rumbling
as
of
rushing
water
but
only
a
faint
murmur
of
it
penetrated
into
the
cellar
towards
night
it
became
quiet
again
how
long
joan
remained
there
she
was
never
quite
sure
there
was
little
difference
between
day
and
night
after
it
had
been
quiet
for
an
hour
or
so
madame
lelanne
would
go
out
to
return
a
little
later
with
a
wounded
man
upon
her
back
and
when
one
died
she
would
throw
him
across
her
shoulder
and
disappear
again
up
the
steps
sometimes
it
was
a
frenchman
and
sometimes
a
german
she
brought
in
one
gathered
that
the
fight
for
the
village
still
continued
there
was
but
little
they
could
do
for
them
beyond
dressing
their
wounds
and
easing
their
pain
joan
and
the
little
chemist
took
it
in
turns
to
relieve
one
another
if
madame
lelanne
ever
slept
it
was
when
she
would
sit
in
the
shadow
behind
the
stove
her
hands
upon
her
knees
dubos
had
been
in
the
house
when
it
had
fallen
madame
lelanne
had
discovered
him
pinned
against
a
wall
underneath
a
great
oak
beam
that
had
withstood
the
falling
debris
his
beard
had
been
burnt
off
but
otherwise
he
had
been
unharmed
she
seemed
to
be
living
in
a
dream
she
could
not
shake
from
her
the
feeling
that
it
was
not
bodies
but
souls
that
she
was
tending
the
men
themselves
gave
colour
to
this
fancy
of
hers
stripped
of
their
poor
stained
tattered
uniforms
they
were
neither
french
nor
germans
friend
or
foe
it
was
already
but
a
memory
often
awakening
out
of
a
sleep
they
would
look
across
at
one
another
and
smile
as
to
a
comrade
a
great
peace
seemed
to
have
entered
there
faint
murmurs
as
from
some
distant
troubled
world
would
steal
at
times
into
the
silence
it
brought
a
pang
of
pity
but
it
did
not
drive
away
the
quiet
that
dwelt
there
once
someone
who
must
have
known
the
place
and
had
descended
the
steps
softly
sat
there
among
them
and
talked
with
them
joan
could
not
remember
seeing
him
enter
perhaps
unknowing
she
had
fallen
to
sleep
for
a
few
minutes
madame
lelanne
was
seated
by
the
stove
her
great
coarse
hands
upon
her
knees
her
patient
dull
eyes
fixed
upon
the
speaker
face
dubos
was
half
standing
half
resting
against
the
table
his
arms
folded
upon
his
breast
the
wounded
men
had
raised
themselves
upon
the
straw
and
were
listening
some
leant
upon
their
elbows
some
sat
with
their
hands
clasped
round
their
knees
and
one
with
head
bent
down
remained
with
his
face
hidden
in
his
hands
the
speaker
sat
a
little
way
apart
the
light
from
the
oil
lamp
suspended
from
the
ceiling
fell
upon
his
face
he
wore
a
blouse
it
seemed
to
her
a
face
she
knew
possibly
she
had
passed
him
in
the
village
street
and
had
looked
at
him
without
remembering
it
was
his
eyes
that
for
long
years
afterwards
still
haunted
her
she
did
not
notice
at
the
time
what
language
he
was
speaking
but
there
were
none
who
did
not
understand
him
you
think
of
god
as
of
a
great
king
he
said
a
ruler
who
orders
all
things
who
could
change
all
things
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
you
see
the
cruelty
and
the
wrong
around
you
and
you
say
to
yourselves
has
ordered
it
if
he
would
he
could
have
willed
it
differently
so
that
in
your
hearts
you
are
angry
with
him
how
could
it
be
otherwise
what
father
loving
his
children
would
see
them
suffer
wrong
when
by
stretching
out
a
hand
he
could
protect
them
turn
their
tears
to
gladness
what
father
would
see
his
children
doing
evil
to
one
another
and
not
check
them
would
see
them
following
ways
leading
to
their
destruction
and
not
pluck
them
back
if
god
has
ordered
all
things
why
has
he
created
evil
making
his
creatures
weak
and
sinful
does
a
father
lay
snares
for
his
children
leading
them
into
temptation
delivering
them
unto
evil
there
is
no
god
apart
from
man
god
is
a
spirit
his
is
in
man
heart
we
are
his
it
is
through
man
that
he
shall
one
day
rule
the
world
god
is
knocking
at
your
heart
but
you
will
not
open
to
him
you
have
filled
your
hearts
with
love
of
self
there
is
no
room
for
him
to
enter
in
god
whispers
to
you
pitiful
be
merciful
be
just
but
you
answer
him
i
am
pitiful
i
lose
my
time
and
money
if
i
am
merciful
i
forego
advantage
to
myself
if
i
am
just
i
lessen
my
own
profit
and
another
passes
me
in
the
race
and
yet
in
your
inmost
thoughts
you
know
that
you
are
wrong
that
love
of
self
brings
you
no
peace
who
is
happier
than
the
lover
thinking
only
how
to
serve
who
is
the
more
joyous
he
who
sits
alone
at
the
table
or
he
who
shares
his
meal
with
a
friend
it
is
more
blessed
to
give
than
to
receive
how
can
you
doubt
it
for
what
do
you
toil
and
strive
but
that
you
may
give
to
your
children
to
your
loved
ones
reaping
the
harvest
of
their
good
who
among
you
is
the
more
honoured
the
miser
or
the
giver
he
who
heaps
up
riches
for
himself
or
he
who
labours
for
others
who
is
the
true
soldier
he
who
has
put
away
self
his
own
ease
and
comfort
even
his
own
needs
his
own
safety
they
are
but
as
a
feather
in
the
balance
when
weighed
against
his
love
for
his
comrades
for
his
country
the
true
soldier
is
not
afraid
to
love
he
gives
his
life
for
his
friend
do
you
jeer
at
him
do
you
say
he
is
a
fool
for
his
pains
no
it
is
his
honour
his
glory
god
is
love
why
are
you
afraid
to
let
him
in
hate
knocks
also
at
your
door
and
to
him
you
open
wide
why
are
you
afraid
of
love
all
things
are
created
by
love
hate
can
but
destroy
why
choose
you
death
instead
of
life
god
pleads
to
you
he
is
waiting
for
your
help
and
one
answered
him
we
are
but
poor
men
he
said
what
can
we
do
of
what
use
are
such
as
we
the
young
man
looked
at
him
and
smiled
you
can
ask
that
he
said
you
a
soldier
does
the
soldier
say
am
of
no
use
i
am
but
a
poor
man
of
no
account
who
has
need
of
such
as
i
god
has
need
of
all
there
is
none
that
shall
not
help
to
win
the
victory
it
is
with
his
life
the
soldier
serves
who
were
they
whose
teaching
moved
the
world
more
than
it
has
ever
yet
been
moved
by
the
teaching
of
the
wisest
they
were
men
of
little
knowledge
of
but
little
learning
poor
and
lowly
it
was
with
their
lives
they
taught
cast
out
self
and
god
shall
enter
in
and
you
shall
be
one
with
god
for
there
is
none
so
lowly
that
he
may
not
become
the
temple
of
god
there
is
none
so
great
that
he
shall
be
greater
than
this
the
speaker
ceased
there
came
a
faint
sound
at
which
she
turned
her
head
and
when
she
looked
again
he
was
gone
the
wounded
men
had
heard
it
also
dubos
had
moved
forward
madame
lelanne
had
risen
it
came
again
the
thin
faint
shrill
of
a
distant
bugle
footsteps
were
descending
the
stairs
french
soldiers
laughing
shouting
were
crowding
round
them
chapter
xviii
her
father
met
her
at
waterloo
he
had
business
in
london
and
they
stayed
on
for
a
few
days
reading
between
the
lines
of
his
later
letters
she
had
felt
that
all
was
not
well
with
him
his
old
heart
trouble
had
come
back
and
she
noticed
that
he
walked
to
meet
her
very
slowly
it
would
be
all
right
now
that
she
had
returned
he
explained
he
had
been
worrying
himself
about
her
denton
had
died
she
had
left
joan
her
library
together
with
her
wonderful
collection
of
note
books
she
had
brought
them
all
and
indexed
them
they
would
be
invaluable
to
francis
when
he
started
the
new
paper
upon
which
they
had
determined
he
was
still
in
the
hospital
at
breganze
near
to
where
his
machine
had
been
shot
down
she
had
tried
to
get
to
him
but
it
would
have
meant
endless
delays
and
she
had
been
anxious
about
her
father
the
italian
surgeons
were
very
proud
of
him
he
wrote
they
had
had
him
before
and
after
and
beyond
a
slight
lameness
which
gave
him
he
thought
a
touch
of
distinction
there
was
no
flaw
that
the
most
careful
scrutiny
would
be
likely
to
detect
any
day
now
he
expected
to
be
discharged
mary
had
married
an
old
sweetheart
she
had
grown
restless
in
the
country
with
nothing
to
do
and
at
the
suggestion
of
some
friends
had
gone
to
bristol
to
help
in
a
children
hospital
and
there
they
had
met
once
more
neil
singleton
after
serving
two
years
in
a
cholera
hospital
at
baghdad
had
died
of
the
flu
in
dover
hours
after
landing
madge
was
in
palestine
she
had
been
appointed
secretary
to
a
committee
for
the
establishment
of
native
schools
she
expected
to
be
there
for
some
years
she
wrote
the
work
was
interesting
and
appealed
to
her
flossie
her
from
paddington
station
the
second
day
and
by
luck
she
happened
to
be
in
flossie
had
just
come
up
from
devonshire
sam
had
got
through
and
she
was
on
her
way
to
meet
him
at
hull
she
had
heard
of
joan
arrival
in
london
from
one
of
carleton
illustrated
dailies
she
brought
the
paper
with
her
they
had
used
the
old
photograph
that
once
had
adorned
each
week
the
joan
hardly
recognized
herself
in
the
serene
young
woman
who
seemed
to
be
looking
down
upon
a
world
at
her
feet
the
world
was
strong
and
cruel
she
had
discovered
and
joans
but
small
and
weak
one
had
to
pretend
that
one
was
not
afraid
of
it
flossie
had
joined
every
society
she
could
hear
of
that
was
working
for
the
league
of
nations
her
hope
was
that
it
would
get
itself
established
before
young
frank
grew
up
not
that
i
really
believe
it
will
she
confessed
a
draw
might
have
disgusted
us
all
with
fighting
as
it
is
half
the
world
is
dancing
at
victory
balls
exhibiting
captured
guns
on
every
village
green
and
hanging
father
helmet
above
the
mantelpiece
while
the
other
half
is
nursing
its
revenge
young
frank
only
cares
for
life
because
he
is
looking
forward
to
one
day
driving
a
tank
i
made
up
my
mind
to
burn
sam
uniform
but
i
expect
it
will
end
in
my
wrapping
it
up
in
lavender
and
hiding
it
away
in
a
drawer
and
then
there
will
be
all
the
books
and
plays
no
heroine
for
the
next
ten
years
will
dream
of
marrying
anyone
but
a
soldier
joan
laughed
difficult
to
get
anything
else
just
at
present
she
said
it
the
soldiers
i
looking
to
for
help
i
do
think
the
men
who
have
been
there
will
want
their
sons
to
go
it
the
women
afraid
of
flossie
caught
sight
of
the
clock
and
jumped
up
who
was
it
said
that
woman
would
be
the
last
thing
man
would
civilize
she
asked
it
sounds
like
meredith
suggested
joan
i
am
not
quite
sure
well
he
wrong
anyhow
retorted
flossie
it
no
good
our
waiting
for
man
he
is
too
much
afraid
of
us
to
be
of
any
real
help
to
us
we
shall
have
to
do
it
ourselves
she
gave
joan
a
hug
and
was
gone
phillips
was
still
abroad
with
the
army
of
occupation
he
had
tried
to
get
out
of
it
but
had
not
succeeded
he
held
it
to
be
gaoler
work
and
the
sight
of
the
starving
populace
was
stirring
in
him
a
fierce
anger
he
would
not
put
up
again
for
parliament
he
was
thinking
of
going
back
to
his
old
work
upon
the
union
parliament
is
played
out
he
had
written
her
kings
and
aristocracies
have
served
their
purpose
and
have
gone
and
now
the
ruling
classes
as
they
call
themselves
must
be
content
to
hear
the
bell
toll
for
them
also
parliament
was
never
anything
more
than
an
instrument
in
their
hands
and
never
can
be
what
happens
once
in
every
five
years
you
wake
the
people
up
tell
them
the
time
has
come
for
them
to
exercise
their
privilege
of
putting
a
cross
against
the
names
of
some
seven
hundred
gentlemen
who
have
kindly
expressed
their
willingness
to
rule
over
them
after
that
you
send
the
people
back
to
sleep
and
for
the
next
five
years
these
seven
hundred
gentlemen
consulting
no
one
but
themselves
rule
over
the
country
as
absolutely
as
ever
a
caesar
ruled
over
rome
what
sort
of
democracy
is
that
even
a
labour
government
supposing
that
in
spite
of
the
press
it
did
win
through
what
would
be
its
fate
separated
from
its
base
imprisoned
within
those
walls
it
would
lose
touch
with
the
people
would
become
in
its
turn
a
mere
oligarchy
if
the
people
are
ever
to
govern
they
must
keep
their
hand
firmly
upon
the
machine
not
remain
content
with
pulling
a
lever
and
then
being
shown
the
door
she
had
sent
a
note
by
messenger
to
mary
stopperton
to
say
she
was
coming
mary
had
looked
very
fragile
the
last
time
she
had
seen
her
just
before
leaving
for
france
and
she
had
felt
a
fear
mary
had
answered
in
her
neat
thin
quavering
writing
asking
her
to
come
early
in
the
morning
sometimes
she
was
a
little
tired
and
had
to
lie
down
again
she
had
been
waiting
for
joan
she
had
a
present
for
her
the
morning
promised
to
be
fair
and
she
decided
to
walk
by
way
of
the
embankment
the
great
river
with
its
deep
strong
patience
had
always
been
a
friend
to
her
it
was
sunday
and
the
city
was
still
sleeping
the
pale
december
sun
rose
above
the
mist
as
she
reached
the
corner
of
westminster
bridge
turning
the
river
into
silver
and
flooding
the
silent
streets
with
a
soft
white
tender
light
the
tower
of
chelsea
church
brought
back
to
her
remembrance
of
the
wheezy
old
clergyman
who
had
preached
there
that
sunday
evening
that
now
seemed
so
long
ago
when
her
footsteps
had
first
taken
her
that
way
by
chance
always
she
had
intended
making
inquiries
and
discovering
his
name
why
had
she
never
done
so
it
would
surely
have
been
easy
he
was
someone
she
had
known
as
a
child
she
had
become
quite
convinced
of
that
she
could
see
his
face
close
to
hers
as
if
he
had
lifted
her
up
in
his
arms
and
was
smiling
at
her
but
pride
and
power
had
looked
out
of
his
eyes
then
it
was
earlier
than
the
time
she
had
fixed
in
her
own
mind
and
pausing
with
her
elbows
resting
on
the
granite
parapet
she
watched
the
ceaseless
waters
returning
to
the
sea
bearing
their
burden
of
impurities
all
roads
lead
to
calvary
it
was
curious
how
the
words
had
dwelt
with
her
till
gradually
they
had
become
a
part
of
her
creed
she
remembered
how
at
first
they
had
seemed
to
her
a
threat
chilling
her
with
fear
they
had
grown
to
be
a
promise
a
hope
held
out
to
all
the
road
to
calvary
it
was
the
road
to
life
by
the
giving
up
of
self
we
gained
god
and
suddenly
a
great
peace
came
to
her
one
was
not
alone
in
the
fight
god
was
with
us
the
great
comrade
the
evil
and
the
cruelty
all
round
her
she
was
no
longer
afraid
of
it
god
was
coming
beyond
the
menace
of
the
passing
day
black
with
the
war
foul
aftermath
of
evil
dreams
and
hatreds
she
saw
the
breaking
of
the
distant
dawn
the
devil
should
not
always
triumph
god
was
gathering
his
labourers
god
was
conquering
unceasing
through
the
ages
god
voice
had
crept
round
man
seeking
entry
through
the
long
darkness
of
that
dim
beginning
when
man
knew
no
law
but
self
unceasing
god
had
striven
until
at
last
one
here
and
there
emerging
from
the
brute
had
heard
had
listened
to
the
voice
of
love
and
pity
and
in
that
hour
unknowing
had
built
to
god
a
temple
in
the
wilderness
labourers
together
with
god
the
mighty
host
of
those
who
through
the
ages
had
heard
the
voice
of
god
and
had
made
answer
the
men
and
women
in
all
lands
who
had
made
room
in
their
hearts
for
god
still
nameless
scattered
unknown
to
one
another
still
powerless
as
yet
against
the
world
foul
law
of
hate
they
should
continue
to
increase
and
multiply
until
one
day
they
should
speak
with
god
voice
and
should
be
heard
and
a
new
world
should
be
created
god
the
tireless
spirit
of
eternal
creation
the
spirit
of
love
what
else
was
it
that
out
of
formlessness
had
shaped
the
spheres
had
planned
the
orbits
of
the
suns
the
law
of
gravity
we
named
it
what
was
it
but
another
name
for
love
the
yearning
of
like
for
like
the
calling
to
one
another
of
the
stars
what
else
but
love
had
made
the
worlds
had
gathered
together
the
waters
had
fashioned
the
dry
land
the
cohesion
of
elements
so
we
explained
it
the
clinging
of
like
to
like
the
brotherhood
of
the
atoms
god
the
eternal
creator
out
of
matter
lifeless
void
he
had
moulded
his
worlds
had
ordered
his
endless
firmament
it
was
finished
the
greater
task
remained
the
universe
of
mind
of
soul
out
of
man
it
should
be
created
god
in
man
and
man
in
god
made
in
like
image
fellow
labourers
together
with
one
another
together
they
should
build
it
out
of
the
senseless
strife
and
discord
above
the
chaos
and
the
tumult
should
be
heard
the
new
command
let
there
be
love
the
striking
of
the
old
church
clock
recalled
her
to
herself
but
she
had
only
a
few
minutes
walk
before
her
mary
had
given
up
her
church
work
it
included
the
cleaning
and
she
had
found
it
beyond
her
failing
strength
but
she
still
lived
in
the
tiny
cottage
behind
its
long
strip
of
garden
the
door
yielded
to
joan
touch
it
was
seldom
fast
closed
and
knowing
mary
ways
she
entered
without
knocking
and
pushed
it
to
behind
her
leaving
it
still
ajar
and
as
she
did
so
it
seemed
to
her
that
someone
passing
breathed
upon
her
lips
a
little
kiss
and
for
a
while
she
did
not
move
then
treading
softly
she
looked
into
the
room
it
welcomed
her
as
always
with
its
smile
of
cosy
neatness
the
spotless
curtains
that
were
mary
pride
the
gay
flowers
in
the
window
to
which
she
had
given
children
names
the
few
poor
pieces
of
furniture
polished
with
much
loving
labour
the
shining
grate
the
foolish
china
dogs
and
the
little
china
house
between
them
on
the
mantelpiece
the
fire
was
burning
brightly
and
the
kettle
was
singing
on
the
hob
mary
work
was
finished
she
sat
upright
in
her
chair
before
the
table
her
eyes
half
closed
it
seemed
so
odd
to
see
those
little
hands
idle
upon
her
lap
joan
present
lay
on
the
table
near
to
her
as
if
she
had
just
folded
it
and
placed
it
there
the
little
cap
and
the
fine
robe
of
lawn
as
if
for
a
king
child
joan
had
never
thought
that
death
could
be
so
beautiful
it
was
as
if
some
friend
had
looked
in
at
the
door
and
seeing
her
so
tired
had
taken
the
work
gently
from
her
hands
and
had
folded
them
upon
her
lap
and
she
had
yielded
with
a
smile
joan
heard
a
faint
rustle
and
looked
up
a
woman
had
entered
it
was
the
girl
she
had
met
there
on
a
christmas
day
a
miss
ensor
joan
had
met
her
once
or
twice
since
then
she
was
still
in
the
chorus
neither
of
them
spoke
for
a
few
minutes
i
have
been
expecting
every
morning
to
find
her
gone
said
the
girl
i
think
she
only
waited
to
finish
this
she
gently
unfolded
the
fine
lawn
robe
and
they
saw
the
delicate
insertion
and
the
wonderful
embroidery
i
asked
her
once
said
the
girl
why
she
wasted
so
much
work
on
them
they
were
mostly
only
for
poor
people
never
knows
dearie
she
answered
with
that
childish
smile
of
hers
may
be
for
a
little
christ
they
would
not
let
less
loving
hands
come
near
her
her
father
had
completed
his
business
and
both
were
glad
to
leave
london
she
had
a
sense
of
something
sinister
foreboding
casting
its
shadow
on
the
sordid
unclean
streets
the
neglected
buildings
falling
into
disrepair
a
lurking
savagery
a
enmity
seemed
to
be
stealing
among
the
people
the
town
mad
lust
for
pleasure
its
fierce
unjoyous
laughter
its
desire
ever
to
be
in
crowds
as
if
afraid
of
itself
its
orgies
of
eating
and
drinking
its
indifference
to
the
misery
and
death
that
lay
but
a
little
way
beyond
its
own
horizon
she
dared
not
remember
history
perhaps
it
would
pass
the
long
slow
journey
tried
her
father
strength
and
assuming
an
authority
to
which
he
yielded
obedience
tempered
by
grumbling
joan
sent
him
to
bed
and
would
not
let
him
come
down
till
christmas
day
the
big
square
house
was
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
it
was
quiet
and
in
the
afternoon
they
walked
in
the
garden
sheltered
behind
its
high
brick
wall
he
told
her
of
what
had
been
done
at
the
works
arthur
plan
had
succeeded
it
might
not
be
the
last
word
but
at
least
it
was
on
the
road
to
the
right
end
the
men
had
been
brought
into
it
and
shared
the
management
and
the
disasters
predicted
had
proved
groundless
you
wo
be
able
to
indulge
in
all
your
mad
schemes
he
laughed
but
there
be
enough
to
help
on
a
few
and
you
will
be
among
friends
arthur
told
me
he
had
explained
it
to
you
and
that
you
had
agreed
yes
she
answered
it
was
the
last
time
he
came
to
see
me
in
london
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
a
bit
jealous
he
was
doing
things
while
i
was
writing
and
talking
but
i
was
glad
he
was
an
allway
it
will
be
known
as
the
allway
scheme
new
ways
will
date
from
it
she
had
thought
it
time
for
him
to
return
indoors
but
he
pleaded
for
a
visit
to
his
beloved
roses
he
prided
himself
on
being
always
able
to
pick
roses
on
christmas
day
this
young
man
of
yours
he
asked
what
is
he
like
oh
just
a
christian
gentleman
she
answered
you
will
love
him
when
you
know
him
he
laughed
and
this
new
journal
of
his
he
asked
it
got
to
be
published
in
london
has
it
she
gave
a
slight
start
for
in
their
letters
to
one
another
they
had
been
discussing
this
very
point
no
she
answered
it
could
be
circulated
just
as
well
from
say
birmingham
or
manchester
he
was
choosing
his
roses
they
held
their
petals
wrapped
tight
round
them
trying
to
keep
the
cold
from
their
brave
hearts
in
the
warmth
they
would
open
out
and
be
gay
until
the
end
not
liverpool
he
suggested
or
even
liverpool
she
laughed
they
looked
at
one
another
and
then
beyond
the
sheltering
evergreens
and
the
wide
lawns
to
where
the
great
square
house
seemed
to
be
listening
it
an
ugly
old
thing
he
said
no
it
is
she
contradicted
it
simple
and
big
and
kind
i
always
used
to
feel
it
disapproved
of
me
i
believe
it
has
come
to
love
me
in
its
solemn
old
brick
way
it
was
built
by
kent
in
for
your
grandfather
he
explained
he
was
regarding
it
more
affectionately
solid
respectability
was
the
dream
then
i
think
that
why
i
love
it
she
said
for
it
dear
ways
we
will
teach
it
the
new
dreams
too
it
will
be
so
shocked
at
first
they
dined
in
state
in
the
great
i
was
going
to
buy
you
a
present
he
grumbled
but
you
would
let
me
get
up
i
want
to
give
you
something
quite
expensive
dad
she
said
i
had
my
eye
on
it
for
years
she
slipped
her
hand
in
his
i
want
you
to
give
me
that
dream
of
yours
that
you
built
for
my
mother
and
that
all
went
wrong
they
call
it
allway
folly
and
it
makes
me
so
mad
i
want
to
make
it
all
come
true
may
i
try
it
was
there
that
he
came
to
her
she
stood
beneath
the
withered
trees
beside
the
shattered
fountain
the
ghosts
peeped
out
at
her
from
the
broken
windows
of
the
little
silent
houses
she
wondered
later
why
she
had
not
been
surprised
to
see
him
but
at
the
time
it
seemed
to
be
in
the
order
of
things
that
she
should
look
up
and
find
him
there
she
went
to
him
with
outstretched
arms
i
so
glad
you
come
she
said
i
was
just
wanting
you
they
sat
on
the
stone
step
of
the
fountain
where
they
were
sheltered
from
the
wind
and
she
buttoned
his
long
coat
about
him
do
you
think
you
will
go
on
doing
it
he
asked
with
a
laugh
i
so
afraid
she
answered
gravely
that
i
shall
come
to
love
you
too
much
the
home
the
children
and
you
i
shall
have
none
left
over
there
is
an
old
hindoo
proverb
he
said
that
when
a
man
and
woman
love
they
dig
a
fountain
down
to
god
this
poor
little
thing
he
said
against
which
we
are
sitting
it
for
want
of
men
and
women
drawing
water
of
children
dabbling
their
hands
in
it
and
making
themselves
all
wet
that
it
has
run
dry
she
took
his
hands
in
hers
to
keep
them
warm
the
nursing
habit
seemed
to
have
taken
root
in
her
i
see
your
argument
she
said
the
more
i
love
you
the
deeper
will
be
the
fountain
so
that
the
more
love
i
want
to
come
to
me
the
more
i
must
love
you
do
you
see
it
for
yourself
he
demanded
she
broke
into
a
little
laugh
perhaps
you
are
right
she
admitted
perhaps
that
is
why
he
made
us
male
and
female
to
teach
us
to
love
a
robin
broke
into
a
song
of
triumph
he
had
seen
the
ghosts
steal
silently
away
