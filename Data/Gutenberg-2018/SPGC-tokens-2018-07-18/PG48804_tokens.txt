this

the

many
years
is
cordially
dedicated
introductory
of
revised
edition
it
is
not
yet
quite
ten
years
since
the
publication
of
common
sense
in
the
household
general
in
offering
the
work
to
the
publishers
under
whose
able
management
it
has
prospered
so
wonderfully
i
said
i
have
written
this
because
i
felt
that
such
a
manual
of
practical
housewifery
is
that
i
judged
aright
taking
my
own
experience
as
a
housekeeper
as
the
criterion
of
the
wants
and
perplexities
of
others
is
abundantly
proved
by
the
circumstance
which
calls
for
this
new
and
revised
edition
of
the
book
through
much
and
constant
copies
having
been
printed
from
stereotype
plates
have
become
so
worn
that
the
impressions
are
faint
and
sometimes
illegible
i
gladly
avail
myself
of
the
opportunity
thus
offered
to
and
so
far
to
alter
the
original
volume
as
may
in
the
light
of
later
improvements
in
the
culinary
art
and
in
my
understanding
of
it
make
the
collection
of
family
receipts
more
intelligible
and
available
nor
have
i
been
able
to
resist
the
temptation
to
interpolate
a
few
excellent
receipts
that
have
come
into
my
hands
at
a
later
period
than
that
of
the
publication
of
the
last
and
in
my
estimation
perhaps
the
most
valuable
of
the
common
sense
series
viz
the
dinner
i
am
grateful
also
to
the
courtesy
of
my
publishers
for
the
privilege
of
thanking
those
to
whom
this
book
was
and
is
dedicated
my
east
south
and
west
their
substantial
endorsement
of
the
work
i
have
done
in
their
behalf
a
collection
of
the
private
letters
i
have
received
from
those
who
have
used
the
general
receipts
would
make
a
volume
very
nearly
as
large
as
this
if
i
have
as
the
writers
of
these
testimonials
assure
done
them
good
have
done
me
more
in
letting
me
know
that
i
have
not
spent
my
strength
for
naught
i
acknowledge
with
pleasure
sundry
pertinent
suggestions
and
inquiries
which
have
led
me
in
this
revision
to
examine
warily
the
phraseology
of
some
receipts
and
to
modify
these
i
believe
for
the
better
but
by
far
the
best
good
done
me
through
this
work
has
been
the
conscious
sisterhood
into
which
i
have
come
with
the
great
body
of
american
housewives
this
is
a
benefit
not
to
be
rated
by
dollars
and
cents
or
measured
by
time
i
hope
my
will
find
their
old
in
fresh
dress
yet
more
serviceable
than
before
and
that

definitely
laid
in

of
that
but
most
independent
of
women
the
housekeeper
who
does
her
own
i
should
perhaps
summon
to

cozy
conference
a
very
weary
of
foot

i
should
not
deserve
to

i
not
know
how
often
with
discouragement
with
much
producing
of
ways
and
means
with
a
certain
despondent
looking
forward
to
the
monotonous
grinding
of
the
household
machine
to
the
certainty
proved
by
past
experience
that
toilsome
as
has
been
this
day
the
morrow
will
prove
yet
more
abundant
in
labors
in
trials
of
strength
and
nerves
and
temper
you
would
tell
me
what
a
dreary
problem
this
of
woman
s
work
that
is
never
done
is
to
your
fainting
soul
how
try
as
you
may
and
as
you
do
to
be
systematic
and
diligent
something
is
always
turning
up
in
the
treadmill
to
keep
you
on
the
strain
how
you
often
say
to
yourself
in
bitterness
of
spirit
that
it
is
a
mistake
of
christian
civilization
to
educate
girls
into
a
love
of
science
and
literature
and
then
condemn
them
to
the
routine
of
a
domestic
drudge
you
do
not
see
you
say
that
years
of
scholastic
training
will
make
you
a
better
cook
a
better
wife
or
mother
you
have
seen
the
many
times
since
assuming
your
present
you
would
have
exchanged
your
knowledge
of
ancient
and
modern
languages
music
and
natural
science
for
the
skill
of
a
competent
the
learning
how
is
such
hard
work
labor
too
uncheered
by
encouraging
words
from
mature
housewives
unsoftened
by
sympathy
even
from
your
husband
or
your
father
or
brother
or
whoever
may
be
the
one
to
whom
you
make
home
it
may
be
that
in
utter
discouragement
you
have
made
up
your
mind
that
you
have
no
talent
for
these
i
have
before
me
now
the
picture
of
a
wife
the
mother
of
four
children
who
many
years
ago
sickened
me
for
all
time
with
that
phrase
in
a
slatternly
at
four
in
the
afternoon
leaning
back
in
the
laziest
and
most
ragged
of
dust
on
the
carpet
on
the
open
piano
the
mantel
the
mirrors
even
on
her
own
hair
she
rubbed
the
soft
palm
of
one
hand
with
the
grimy
fingers
of
the
other
and
with
a
smile
whined
now
i
am
one
of
the
kind
who
have
no
talent
for
such
things
the
kitchen
and
housework
and
sewing
are
absolutely
hateful
to
uncongenial
to
my
turn
of
mind
the
height
of
my
earthly
ambition
is
to
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
paint
on
velvet
all
day
i
felt
then
in
the
height
of
my
indignant
disgust
that
there
was
propriety
as
well
as
wit
in
the
spectator
s
suggestion
that
every
young
woman
should
before
fixing
the
be
compelled
by
law
to
exhibit
to
inspectors
a
prescribed
number
of
useful
articles
as
her
clothing
made
by
her
own
hands
and
that
it
would
be
wise
legislation
which
should
add
to
these
proofs
of
her
fitness
for
her
new
sphere
a
practical
knowledge
of
housework
and
cookery
if
you
have
not
what
our
yankee
grandmothers
termed
a
faculty
for
are
obliged
as
is
the
case
with
an
immense
majority
of
american
women
to
conduct
the
affairs
of
a
household
bills
of
fare
is
the
more
reason
for
earnest
application
to
your
profession
if
the
natural
taste
be
dull
lay
to
it
more
strength
of
born
of
a
just
sense
of
the
importance
of
the
knowledge
and
dexterity
you
would
acquire
do
not
scoff
at
the
word
call
not
that
common
and
unclean
which
providence
has
designated
as
your
i
speak
not
now
of
the
labors
of
the
culinary
department
alone
but
without
naming
the
other
duties
which
you
and
you
only
can
perform
i
do
insist
that
upon
method
skill
economy
in
the
kitchen
depends
so
much
of
the
of
the
rest
of
the
household
that
it
may
safely
be
styled
the
foundation
of
housewifery
i
own
it
would
be
pleasanter
in
most
cases
especially
to
those
who
have
cultivated
a
taste
for
intellectual
pursuits
to
live
above
the
heat
and
odor
of
this
department
it
must
be
very
fine
to
have
an
efficient
in
the
person
of
a
french
cook
or
a
competent
or
an
accomplished
who
receives
your
orders
for
the
day
in
your
boudoir
or
library
and
executes
the
same
with
zeal
and
discretion
that
leave
you
no
room
for
anxiety
or
regret
such
mistresses
do
not
need
the
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
in
this
country
these
are
in
an
estate
like
this
would
not
comprehend
what
i
am
now
writing
would
not
enter
into
the
depths
of
that
compassionate
yearning
which
moves
me
as
i
think
of
what
i
have
known
for
myself
in
the
earlier
years
of
my
wedded
life
what
i
have
heard
and
seen
in
other
households
of
honest
intentions
brought
to
contempt
of
toil
of
mortification
and
the
heavy
wearing
sense
of
inferiority
that
puts
the
novice
at
such
a
woful
disadvantage
in
a
community
of
notable
managers
there
is
no
use
in
enlarging
upon
this
point
you
and
i
might
compare
experiences
by
the
hour
without
exhausting
our
store
and
then
sigh
with
a
sense
of
resentment
upon
you
however
amiable
your
disposition
for
the
provocation
is
and
young
housekeepers
assistants
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
are
such
humbugs
lanterns
at
often
my
dear
would
you
mind
handing
me
the
book
which
lies
nearest
you
on
the
table
there
dickens
of
course
you
will
usually
find
something
of

every
room

hear
the
bride
john
rokesmith
upon
our
common
grievance
she
was
under
the
constant
necessity
of
referring
for
advice
and
support
to
a
sage
volume
entitled
the
complete
british
family
housewife
which
she
would
sit
consulting
with
her
elbows
upon
the
table
and
her
temples
in
her
hands
like
some
perplexed
enchantress
poring
over
the
black
art
this
principally
because
the
complete
british
housewife
however
sound
a
briton
at
heart
was
by
no
means
an
expert
briton
at
expressing
herself
with
clearness
in
the
british
tongue
and
sometimes
might
have
issued
her
directions
to
equal
purpose
in
the
kamtchatkan
don
t
interrupt
me
my
sister
there
is
more
of
the
same
sort
to
come
there
was
likewise
a
coolness
on
the
part
of
the
complete
british
housewife
which
john
rokesmith
found
highly
exasperating
she
would
say
take
a
salamander
as
if
a
general
should
command
a
private
to
catch
a
tartar
or
she
would
casually
issue
the
order
throw
in
a
handful
of
something
entirely
unattainable
in
these
the
housewife
s
most
glaring
moments
of
unreason
bella
would
shut
her
up
and
knock
her
on
the
table
apostrophizing
her
with
the
o
you
are
a
stupid
old
donkey
where
am
i
to
get
it
do
you
think
when
i
took
possession
of
my
first
real
home
the
prettily
furnished
cottage
to
which
i
came
as
a
bride
more
full
of
hope
and
courage
than
if
i
had
been
wiser
five
good
friends
presented
me
with
as
many
each
complete
and
all
by
different
compilers
one
day
s
investigation
of
my
convinced
me
that
my
servants
knew
no
more
about
cookery
than
i
did
or
affected
stupidity
to
develop
my
capabilities
or
ignorance
too
proud
to
let
them
suspect
the
truth
or
to
have
it
bruited
abroad
as
a
topic
for
pitying
or
contemptuous
gossip
i
shut
myself
up
with
complete
housewives
and
inclined
seriously
to
the
study
of
the
same
comparing
one
with
the
other
and
seeking
to
shape
a
theory
which
should
grow
into
practice
in
accordance
with
the
best
authority
i
don
t
like
to
remember
that
time
the
question
of
disagreeing
doctors
and
the
predicament
of
falling
between
two
stools
are
trivial
perplexities
when
compared
with
my
strife
and
failure
said
the
studious
countryman
to
whom
a
mischievous
acquaintance
lent
webster
s
unabridged
dictionary
as
an
entertaining
volume
i
wrastled
and
i
wrastled
i
wrastled
with
it
but
i
couldn
t
get
up
much
of
an
int
my
wrestling
begat
naught
save
pitiable
confusion
hopeless
distress
and
a
sick
headache
during
which
season
i
am
not
sure
that
i
did
not
darkly
contemplate
suicide
as
the
only
sure
escape
from
the
meshes
that
girt
me
at
the
my
despondency
a
friend
one
with
a
great
heart
and
steady
brain
came
to
my
rescue
her
cheerful
laugh
over
my
dilemma
rings
down
to
me
now
through
all
these
years
refreshingly
as
it
then
saluted
my
ears
bless
your
innocent
little
heart
she
cried
in
her
fresh
gay
voice
out
of
a
hundred
cookbooks
are
written
by
people
who
never
kept
house
and
the
hundredth
by
a
good
cook
who
yet
doesn
t
know
how
to
express
herself
to
the
enlightenment
of
others
compile
a
receipt
book
for
yourself
make
haste
slowly
learn
one
thing
at
a
time
and
when
you
have
mastered
it
make
a
note
on
it
as
captain
cuttle
losing
sight
of
the
principle
that
you
do
it
in
order
to
learn
then
she
opened
to
me
her
own
manual
work
of
years
recommending
as
i
seized
it
that
i
should
commence
my
novitiate
with
simple
dishes
this
was
the
beginning
of
the
hoard
of
practical
receipts
i
now
offer
for
your
inspection
for
twenty
years
i
have
steadily
pursued
this
work
gleaning
here
and
sifting
there
and
levying
such
remorseless
contributions
upon
my
friends
that
i
fear
the
sight
of
my
paper
and
pencil
has
long
since
become
a
bugbear
for
the
kindness
and
courtesy
which
have
been
my
invariable
portion
in
this
quest
i
hereby
return
hearty
thanks
for
the
encouraging
words
and
good
wishes
that
have
ever
answered
the
hint
of
my
intention
to
collect
what
had
proved
so
valuable
to
me
into
a
printed
volume
i
declare
myself
to
be
yet
more
a
debtor
i
do
not
claim
for
my
compend
the
proud
of
the
complete
american
it
is
no
boastful
system
of
cookery
taught
in
twelve
and
i
should
write
myself
down
a
knave
or
a
fool
were
i
to
assert
that
a
raw
cook
or
ignorant
mistress
can
by
s
study
of
my
collection
equal
soyer
or
blot
or
even
approximate
the
art
of
a
scullion
we
may
as
well
start
from
the
right
point
if
we
hope
to
continue
friends
you
must
learn
the
rudiments
of
the
art
for
yourself
practice
and
practice
alone
will
teach
you
certain
essentials
the
management
of
the
ovens
the
requisite
thickness
of
boiling
custards
the
right
shade
of
brown
upon
bread
and
roasted
and
dozens
of
other
details
are
hints
which
can
not
be
imparted
by
written
or
oral
instructions
but
once
learned
they
are
never
forgotten
and
henceforward
your
fate
is
in
your
own
hands
you
are
mistress
of
yourself
though
servants
leave
have
faith
in
your
own
abilities
you
will
be
a
better
cook
for
the
mental
training
you
have
received
at
school
and
from
books
brains
tell
everywhere
to
say
nothing
of
intelligent
observation
just
judgment
a
faithful
memory
and
orderly
habits
consider
that
you
have
a
profession
as
i
said
just
now
and
resolve
to
understand
it
in
all
its
branches
my
book
is
designed
to
help
you
i
believe
it
will
if
for
no
other
reason
because
it
has
been
a
faithful
guide
to
reference
beyond
value
in
seasons
of
doubt
and
need
i
have
brought
every
receipt
to
the
test
of
common
sense
and
experience
those
which
i
have
not
tried
myself
were
obtained
from
trustworthy
best
i
know
i
have
enjoyed
the
task
heartily
and
from
first
to
last
the
persuasion
has
never
left
me
that
i
was
engaged
in
a
good
cause
throughout
i
have
had
you
my
dear
sister
present
before
me
with
the
little
plait
between
your
brows
the
wistful
look
about
eye
and
mouth
that
reveal
to
me
as
words
could
not
your
desire
to
do
your
in
a
humble
home
and
in
a
humble
way
i
hear
you
add
perhaps
you
are
not
ambitious
you
only
want
to
help
john
and
to
make
him
and
the
children
comfortable
and
heaven
reward
your
honest
loyal
endeavors
would
you
mind
if
i
were
to
whisper
a
word
in
your
ear
i
don
t
care
to
have
progressive
people
hear
progress
is
a
grand
thing
when
it
takes
the
right
direction
my
dear
john
and
the
children
and
the
humble
home
make
your
sphere
for
the
present
you
say
be
sure
you
fill
before
you
seek
one
wider
and
higher
there
is
no
better
receipt
between
these
covers
than
that
leave
the
rest
to
god
everybody
knows
those
four
lines
of
george
herbert
s
which
ought
to
be
framed
and
hung
up
in
the
of
every
house
a
servant
with
this
clause
makes
drudgery
divine
who
sweeps
a
room
as
for
thy
laws
makes
that
and
th
action
i
wonder
if
the
sainted
poet
that
land
where
drudgery
is
one
of
the
rough
places
forever
overpast
and
work
is
unmingled
how
many
sad
and
striving
hearts
those
words
have
brought
peace
and
by
way
of
helping
john
not
only
by
saving
money
and
preparing
palatable
and
wholesome
dishes
for
his
table
but
by
sparing
the
wife
he
loves
many
needless
steps
and
much
hurtful
care
will
you
heed
a
homely
hint
or
two
relative
to
the
practice
of
your
art
study
method
and
economy
of
time
and
strength
no
less
than
of
materials
i
take
it
for
granted
that
you
are
too
intelligent
to
share
in
the
vulgar
prejudice
against
machines
a
costs
a
trifle
in
comparison
with
the
time
and
patience
required
to
stone
the
fruit
in
the
old
way
a
dover
for
a
treasure
so
with
syllabub
churns
and
slicers
clothes
wringers
and
sprinklers
and
the
like
most
of
these
are
made
of
therefore
cheap
and
easily
kept
clean
let
each
article
have
its
own
place
in
the
closet
and
kitchen
to
which
restore
it
so
soon
as
you
have
done
using
it
before
undertaking
the
preparation
of
any
dish
read
over
the
receipt
carefully
unless
you
are
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
manufacture
of
it
many
excellent
housewives
have
a
fashion
of
saying
loftily
when
asked
how
such
things
are
i
carry
all
my
receipts
in
my
head
i
never
wrote
out
one
in
my
and
you
if
timid
and
are
smitten
with
shame
keep
your
out
of
sight
and
cram
your
memory
with
ingredients
and
measures
times
and
weights
for
fear
mrs
notable
should
suspect
you
of
rawness
and
inefficiency
whereas
the
truth
is
that
if
you
have
a
mind
worthy
of
the
name
its
powers
are
too
valuable
to
be
laden
with
such
details
master
the
general
principles
as
i
said
just
now
and
for
particulars
look
to
your
having
refreshed
your
memory
by
this
reference
pick
out
from
your
household
stores
and
set
in
convenient
order
within
reach
of
your
hand
everything
you
will
need
in
making
ready
the
particular
compound
under
consideration
then
take
your
stand
in
the
sit
if
you
can
it
is
common
a
pious
duty
to
take
judicious
care
of
your
physical
health
i
lay
it
down
as
a
safe
and
imperative
rule
for
kitchen
stand
when
you
can
do
your
work
as
well
while
if
i
could
have
john
s
ear
for
a
minute
i
would
tell
him
that
which
would
lead
him
to
watch
you
and
exercise
wholesome
authority
in
this
regard
next
prepare
each
ingredient
for
mixing
that
the
bread
cake
pudding
soup
or
ragoût
may
not
be
delayed
when
half
finished
because
the
flour
is
not
sifted
or
the
shortening
warmed
the
sugar
and
butter
are
not
creamed
the
meat
not
cut
up
or
the
herbs
not
minced
don
t
begin
until
you
are
ready
then
go
steadily
forward
without
haste
without
rest
and
think
of
what
you
are
doing
dickens
again
why
not
since
there
is
no
more
genial
and
pertinent
philosopher
of
common
life
and
subjects
to
quote
it
was
a
maxim
of
captain
swosser
s
said
badger
speaking
in
his
figurative
naval
manner
that
when
you
make
pitch
hot
you
can
not
make
it
too
hot
and
that
if
you
have
only
to
swab
a
plank
you
should
swab
it
as
if
davy
jones
were
after
you
it
appears
to
me
that
this
maxim
is
applicable
to
the
medical
as
well
as
the
nautical
to
all
professions
observed
badger
it
was
admirably
said
by
captain
swosser
beautifully
said
but
it
will
sometimes
happen
that
when
you
have
heated
your
pitch
or
swabbed
your
deck
or
made
your
pudding
according
to
the
lights
set
before
you
the
result
is
a
failure
this
is
especially
apt
to
occur
in
a
maiden
effort
you
have
wasted
materials
and
time
and
suffered
moreover
acute
enwrapped
in
a
wet
blanket
of
discouragement
instead
of
the
seemly
robe
of
complacency
yet
no
part
of
the
culinary
education
is
more
useful
if
turned
to
proper
account
than
this
very
discipline
of
failure
it
is
a
to
it
is
true
but
often
sure
you
have
learned
how
to
do
it
right
which
is
the
next
thing
to
success
it
is
pretty
certain
that
you
will
avoid
in
your
second
essay
the
rock
upon
which
you
have
split
this
time
and
after
all
there
are
few
failures
which
are
utter
and
irremediable
scorched
soups
and
custards
sour
bread
biscuit
yellow
with
soda
and
cake
heavy
as
lead
come
under
the
head
of
they
are
absolutely
unfit
to
be
set
before
civilized
beings
and
educated
stomachs
should
such
mishaps
occur
lock
the
memory
of
the
attempt
in
your
own
bosom
and
do
not
vex
or
amuse
john
and
your
guests
with
the
narration
still
less
with
visible
proof
of
the
calamity
many
a
partial
failure
would
pass
unobserved
but
for
the
clouded
brow
and
earnest
apologies
of
the
hostess
do
not
apologize
except
at
the
last
gasp
if
there
is
but
one
chance
in
ten
that
a
single
person
present
may
not
discover
the
deficiency
which
has
changed
all
food
on
the
table
to
dust
and
to
you
trust
to
the
one
chance
and
carry
off
the
matter
bravely
you
will
be
astonished
to
find
if
you
keep
your
wits
about
you
how
often
even
your
husband
will
remain
in
blissful
ignorance
that
aught
has
gone
wrong
if
you
do
not
tell
him
you
know
so
well
what
should
have
been
the
product
of
your
labor
that
you
exaggerate
the
justice
of
others
perceptions
console
yourself
furthermore
with
the
reflection
that
yours
is
not
the
first
failure
upon
record
nor
the
and
that
there
will
be
as
many
as
there
have
been
yesterdays
don
t
add
to
a
trifling
the
real
discomfort
of
a
discontented
or
fretful
wife
say
blithely
if
john
note
your
i
hope
to
do
better
another
time
and
do
not
be
satisfied
until
you
have
redeemed
your
pledge
experience
and
your
quick
wit
will
soon
teach
you
how
to
avert
impending
evils
of
this
nature
how
to
snatch
your
preparations
from
imminent
destruction
and
by
ingenious
correctives
or
concealments
to
make
them
presentable
these
you
will
soon
learn
for
yourself
if
you
keep
before
you
the
truism
i
have
already
written
to
wit
that
few
failures
are
beyond
repair
never
try
experiments
for
the
benefit
of
invited
guests
nor
when
john
is
at
home
risk
the
success
of
your
meal
upon
a
new
dish
have
something
which
you
know
he
can
eat
and
introduce
experiments
as
but
do
not
be
too
shy
of
innovations
in
the
shape
of
untried
dishes
variety
is
not
only
pleasant
but
healthful
the
least
pampered
palate
will
weary
of
stereotyped
bills
of
fare
it
is
an
idea
which
should
have
been
exploded
long
ago
that
plain
roast
boiled
and
fried
on
monday
tuesday
wednesday
and
thursday
on
friday
with
every
saturday
are
means
of
grace
because
economical
and
with
this
should
have
vanished
the
prejudice
against
as
our
french
friends
term
them
i
have
tried
in
the
following
pages
to
set
forth
the
attractions
of
these
and
their
claims
to
your
attention
as
being
savory
economical
nourishing
and
often
elegant
in
preparing
these
acceptably
everything
depends
upon
your
own
taste
and
skill
season
with
judgment
cook
just
enough
and
not
a
minute
too
long
and
dish
nicely
the
recommendation
of
the
eye
to
the
palate
is
a
point
no
cook
can
afford
to
disregard
if
you
can
offer
an
unexpected
visitor
nothing
better
than
and
cold
ham
he
will
enjoy
the
luncheon
twice
as
much
if
the
bread
be
sliced
thinly
and
evenly
spread
smoothly
each
slice
folded
in
the
middle
upon
the
buttered
surface
and
piled
symmetrically
if
the
ham
be
also
cut
thin
scarcely
thicker
than
a
wafer
and
garnished
with
parsley
cresses
or
curled
lettuce
set
on
mustard
and
pickles
let
the
and
napkin
be
white
and
glossy
the
glass
clear
and
plate
shining
clean
and
add
to
these
accessories
to
comfort
a
bright
welcome
and
my
word
for
it
you
need
fear
no
dissatisfaction
on
his
part
however
epicurean
may
be
his
tastes
should
your
cupboard
be
bare
of
aught
more
substantial
than
crackers
and
cheese
do
not
yield
to
dismay
split
the
crackers
if
splittable
toast
the
inside
lightly
and
butter
while
hot
grate
your
cheese
into
a
powdery
mound
garnishing
the
edges
of
the
plate
if
you
have
no
beverage
except
water
to
set
before
him
let
this
be
cool
and
pour
it
out
for
him
yourself
into
an
irreproachable
glass
a
dirty
a
smeared
goblet
or
a
sticky
plate
will
spoil
the
most
luxurious
feast
a
table
well
set
is
i
have
not
said
of
that
which
is
pressing
upon
my
heart
and
mind
yet
i
fear
you
may
think
me
trite
and
tedious
one
suggestion
more
and
we
will
proceed
to
the
details
of
business
i
believe
that
so
far
as
care
can
avail
in
securing
such
a
result
my
receipts
are
accurate
but
in
the
matter
of
seasoning
and
other
minor
details
consult
your
judgment
and
john
s
taste
take
this
liberty
with
whatever
receipt
you
think
you
can
improve
if
i
chance
to
find
in
your
or
upon
the
kitchen
dresser
a
copy
of
my
beloved
common
sense
with
copious
annotations
in
the
margin
i
shall
so
far
from
feeling
wounded
be
flattered
in
having
so
diligent
a
student
and
with
your
permission
shall
engraft
the
most
happy
suggestions
upon
the
next
edition
for
the
speedy
issue
of
which
the
petitioner
doth
humbly
pray
marion
harland
note
in
looking
over
this
book
the
reader
will
notice
certain
receipts
marked
i
do
not
claim
for
these
greater
merit
than
should
of
right
be
accorded
to
many
others
i
merely
wish
to
call
the
attention
of
the
novice
to
them
as
certainly
safe
and
for
the
most
part
simple
every
one
thus
marked
has
been
tried
by
myself
most
of
them
are
in
frequent
some
in
daily
use
in
my
own
family
my
reason
for
thus
singling
out
comparatively
a
small
number
of
receipts
from
the
rest
is
the
recollection
of
my
own
loss
of
time
and
patience
to
which
i
have
been
subjected
in
the
examination
of
a
new
with
an
eye
to
immediate
use
of
the
directions
laid
down
for
various
dishes
i
have
often
and
vainly
wished
for
a
to
guide
me
in
my
search
for
those
which
were
easy
and
sure
and
which
would
result
satisfactorily
this
sort
of
directory
i
have
endeavored
to
supply
taking
care
however
to
inform
the
reader
in
advance
that
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
not
an
unsafe
receipt
in
the
whole
work
of
course
it
was
not
necessary
or
expedient
to
append
the
above
sign
to
plain
roast
and
boiled
which
are
in
common
use
everywhere
soups
the
base
of
your
soup
should
always
be
uncooked
meat
to
this
may
be
added
if
you
like
cracked
bones
of
cooked
game
or
of
underdone
beef
or
mutton
but
for
flavor
and
nourishment
depend
upon
the
juices
of
the
meat
which
was
put
in
raw
cut
this
into
small
pieces
and
beat
the
bone
until
it
is
fractured
at
every
inch
of
its
length
put
them
on
in
cold
water
without
salt
and
heat
very
slowly
not
boil
fast
at
any
stage
of
the
keep
the
pot
covered
and
do
not
add
the
salt
until
the
meat
is
thoroughly
done
as
it
has
a
tendency
to
harden
the
fibres
and
restrain
the
flow
of
the
juices
through
a
cullender
after
which
clear
soups
should
be
filtered
through
a
or
coarse
bobbinet
lace
the
bag
should
not
be
squeezed
it
is
slovenly
to
leave
rags
of
meat
husks
of
vegetables

bits
of
bone

not

some
persons
have
a

neglecting
the

serving
it
like
stewed
beans
which
have
been
imperfectly
drained
the
practice
is
both
slovenly
and
unwholesome
since
the
husks
of
the
cereal
are
thus
imposed
upon
the
digestive
organs
of
the
eater

no

some
lay
the

the
better

is
to

a
small

containing

if
the
directions
be
closely
followed
the
result
is
sure
to

very
good

go

she

poultry
should

less
than
six
or
eight
hours
after
it
is
killed
but
it
should
be
picked
and
drawn
as
soon
as
possible
there
is
no
direr
disgrace
to
our
northern
markets
than
the
practice
of
sending
whole
dead
fowls
to
market
i
have
bought
such
from
responsible
poultry
dealers
and
found
them
uneatable
from
having
remained
undrawn
until
the
flavor
of
the
craw
and
intestines
had
impregnated
the
whole
body
those
who
are
conversant
with
the
habit
of
careful
country
housewives
of
keeping
up
a
fowl
without
food
for
a
day
and
night
before
killing
and
dressing
for
their
own
eating
can
not
but
regard
with
disgust
the
surcharged
crops
and
puffy
sides
of
those
sold
in
the
shambles
if
you
want
to
know
what
you
really
pay
for
poultry
bought
in
these
circumstances
weigh
the
offal
extracted
from
the
fowl
by
your
cook
and
deduct
from
the
market
weight
but
don
t
you
know
it
actually
poisons
a
fowl
to
lie
so
long
undressed
once
exclaimed
a
southern
lady
to
me
in
markets
they
are
offered
for
sale
ready
picked
and
drawn
with
the
under
their
i
know
nothing
about
the
poisonous
nature
of
the
entrails
and
crops
i
do
assert
that
the
custom
is
unclean
and
unjust
and
this
i
do
without
the
remotest
hope
of
arousing
my
to
remonstrance
against
established
usage
only
it
relieves
my
mind
somewhat
to
grumble
at
what
i
can
not
help
the
best
remedy
i
can
propose
for
the
grievance
is
to
buy
live
fowls
and
before
sending
them
home
ask
your
butcher
to
decapitate
them
the
probabilities
being
greatly
in
favor
of
the
supposition
that
your
cook
is
too
to
attempt
the
job
one
word
as
to
the
manner
of
roasting
meats
and
fowls
in
this
day
of
ranges
and
i
think
i
am
speaking
within
bounds
when
i
assume
that
not
one
housekeeper
in
fifty
uses
a
spit
or
even
a
tin
kitchen
for
such
purposes
it
is
in
vain
that
the
writers
of
inform
us
with
refreshing
that
all
our
meats
are
baked
not
roasted
and
expatiate
upon
the
superior
flavor
of
those
prepared
upon
the
english
spits
and
in
old
fashioned
kitchens
where
enormous
blazed
from
morning
until
night
i
shall
not
soon
forget
my
perplexity
when
an
inexperienced
housekeeper
and
a
firm
believer
in
all
that
was
writ
by
older
and
wiser
people
i
stood
before
my
neat
mott
s
defiance
a
fine
sirloin
of
beef
ready
to
be
cooked
on
the
table
behind
me
and
read
from
my
that
my
fire
should
extend
at
least
eight
inches
beyond
the
roaster
on
either
side
i
am
not
denying
the
virtues
of
spits
and
tin
regretting
that
they
are
not
within
the
reach
of
every
one
in
view
of
this
fact
let
me
remark
for
the
benefit
of
the
unfortunate
many
that
in
the
opinion
of
excellent
judges
the
practice
of
roasting
meat
in
close
ovens
has
advantages
of
these
i
need
mention
but
two
to
wit
the
preservation
of
the
flavor
of
the
article
roasted
and
the
prevention
of
its
escape
to
the
upper
regions
of
the
dwelling
roast
turkey
after
drawing
the
turkey
rinse
out
with
several
waters
and
in
next
to
the
last
mix
a
teaspoonful
of
soda
the
inside
of
a
fowl
especially
if
purchased
in
the
market
is
sometimes
very
sour
and
imparts
an
unpleasant
taste
to
the
stuffing
if
not
to
the
inner
part
of
the
legs
and
the
soda
will
act
as
a
corrective
and
is
moreover
very
cleansing
fill
the
body
with
this
water
shake
well
empty
it
out
and
rinse
with
fair
water
then
prepare
a
dressing
of
mixed
with
butter
pepper
salt
thyme
or
sweet
marjoram
you
may
if
you
like
add
the
beaten
yolks
of
two

little

esteemed
an
improvement
when
well
incorporated

ten
minutes

it
will
depend
very
much

this
rule
holds
good

make
your

remove
most
of
the

skewer
the
meat
into
the
shape

if

roast
in

oven
it
is
a
good
plan
to
dash
a
small
cup
of
water
over
the
meat
in
first
putting
it
down
letting
it
trickle
into
the
pan
this
for
a
season
checks
the
escape
of
the
juices

allows
the

to
get
warmed

the

persisted
in
calling

is
very
palatable
and
popular
and
not
so
rich
as
would
be
thought
from
the
manner
of
baking
it
should
be
a
when
done
it
is
not
customary
to
fry
for
people
who
know
what
really
good
cookery
is
to
speak
more
plainly
a
steak
by
heat
and
swimming
in
grease
is
a
culinary
solecism
both
vulgar
and
indigestible
cut
the
steak
thick
at
least
of
an
inch
in
thickness
and
if
you
can
not
get
tender
meat
for
this
purpose
it
is
best
to
substitute
some
other
dish
for
it
but
since
tender
meat
is
not
always
to
be
had
if
the
piece
you
have
purchased
is
doubtful
lay
it
on
a
clean
cloth
take
a
blunt
heavy
if
you
have
not
a
steak
mallet
and
hack
from
one
end
to
the
other
then
turn
and
repeat
the
process
upon
the
other
side
the
knife
should
be
so
dull
you
can
not
cut
with
it
and
the
strokes
not
the
sixtieth
part
of
an
inch
apart
wipe
all
over
on
both
sides
with
cover
and
leave
it
in
a
cool
place
for
one
hour
lay
on
a
buttered
gridiron
over
a
clear
fire
turning
very
often
as
it
begins
to
drip
do
not
season
until
it
is
done
which
will
be
in
about
twelve
minutes
if
the
fire
is
good
and
the
cook
attentive
rub
your
hot
chafing
dish
with
a
split
raw
onion
lay
in
the
steak
salt
and
pepper
on
both
sides
and
put
a
liberal
lump
of
butter
upon
the
upper
then
put
on
a
hot
cover
and
let
it
stand
five
minutes
to
draw
the
juices
to
the
surface
before
it
is
eaten
if
you
have
neither
nor
cover
lay
the
steak
between
two
hot
platters
for
the
same
time
sending
to
table
without
uncovering
a
gridiron
fitting
the
grate
is
better
than
any
other
if
a
gridiron
is
not
at
hand
rub
a
little
butter
upon
the
bottom
of
a
hot
clean
put
in
the
meat
set
over
a
bright
fire
and
turn
frequently
this
will
not
be
equal
to
steak
cooked
upon
a
gridiron
but
it
is
infinitely
preferable
to
the
same
fried
i
shall
never
forget
the
wondering
distrust
with
which
my
first
cook
a
sable
professional
watched
me
when
i
undertook
to
show
her
how
to
prepare
a
steak
for
the
third
breakfast
over
which
i
presided
as
mistress
of
ceremonies
and
when
at
the
end
of
twelve
minutes
i
removed
the
meat
rare
and
hot
to
the
heated
dish
in
readiness
her
sniff
of
lofty
contempt
was
as
eloquent
as
indescribable
call
dat
folks
bout
here
would
a
had
dat
steak
on
by
a
remark
that
has
been
recalled
to
my
mind
hundreds
of
times
since
at
the
tables
of
capital
housewives
the
the
only
pieces
for
steak
are
those
known
as
and
sirloin
the
former
is
the
more
highly
esteemed
by
gourmands
but
a
really
tender
sirloin
is
more
serviceable
where
there
are
several
persons
in
the
family
the
having
a
narrow
strip
of
extremely
nice
meat
lying
next
the
bone
while
the
rest
is
often
inferior
to
any
part
of
the
sirloin
if
the
meat
be
tender
omit
the
hacking
process
and
and
onions
prepare
the
steak
as
above
directed
while
it
is
broiling
put
three
or
four
chopped
onions
in
a
with
a
little
or
butter
stir
and
shake
them
briskly
until
they
are
done
and
begin
to
brown
dish
your
steak
and
lay
the
onions
thickly
on
top
cover
and
let
all
stand
five
or
six
minutes
that
the
hot
onions
may
impart
the
required
flavor
to
the
hot
meat
in
helping
your
guests
inquire
if
they
will
take
onions
with
the
slices
of
steak
put
upon
their
plates
i
need
hardly
remind
the
sensible
cook
how
necessary
it
is
to
withdraw
the
gridiron
from
the
fire
for
an
instant
should
the
fat
drip
upon
the
coals
below
and
smoke
or
blaze
yet
those
who
have
eaten
steaks
flavored
with
creosote
may
thank
me
for
the
suggestion

take
a

half
an

frequently
if
you
roast
the

do
not
remove

so
with

do
not
omit
this
precaution
if
you
would
have
the
skin
tender

soft
after

will
require
about
an

should

prepare

it
is
worth
one
s
while
to
take
the
trouble
to
prepare
this
stuffing
if
your
pig
is
large
you
can
cut
off
his
head
and
split
him
down
the
back
before
sending
to
table
do
this
with
a
sharp
knife
and
lay
the
backs
together
but
it
is
a
pity
i
have
before
me
now
the
vision
of
a
pig
i
once
saw
served
whole
on
the
table
of
a
friend
that
forbids
me
ever
to
mutilate
him
before
the
guests
have
a
chance
to
feast
their
eyes
upon
the
goodly
picture
he
was
done
to
a
rich
even
brown
without
a
seam
or
crack
from
head
to
tail
and
he
knelt
in
a
bed
of
parsley
alternately
with
bunches
of
celery
tops
the
inner
and
tender
leaves
a
garland
of
the
same
was
about
his
neck
and
in
his
mouth
was
a
tuft
of
white
cauliflower
surrounded
by
a
setting
of
curled
parsley
very
simple
you
see
but
i
never
beheld
a
more
ornamental
roast
skim
your
gravy
well
add
a
little
hot
water
thicken
with

flour
boil
up

and
when
you
have
added
half
a
glass
of
wine
and
half
the
juice
of
a
lemon
serve
in
a
tureen
in
carving
the
pig
cut
off
the
head
first
then
split
down
the
back
take
off
hams
and
shoulders
and
separate
the
ribs
serve
some
of
the
dressing
to
each
person
i
have
been
thus
minute
in
describing
the
preparation
of
this
holiday
dish
because
it
is
erroneously
considered
a
difficult
task
any
cook
with
a
moderate
degree
of
judgment
and
experience
can
undertake
it
with
a
reasonable
expectation
of
success
pork

every
housekeeper
knows
how
unfit
for
really
nice
cooking
is
the
pressed
lard
sold
in
stores
as
the
best
and
it
is
close
and
tough
melts
slowly
and
is
sometimes
diversified
by
fibrous
lumps
and
even
when
lard
has
been
tried
out
by
the
usual
process
it
is
often
mixed
with
so
much
water
as
to
remind
us
unpleasantly
that
it
is
bought
by
weight
the
best
way
of
preparing
the
leaf
lard
as
it
is
called
is
to
skin
it
carefully
wash
and
let
it
drain
then
put
it
cut
into
bits
into
a
large
clean
tin
kettle
or
bucket
and
set
this
in
a
pot
of
boiling
water
stir
from
time
to
time
until
it
is
melted
throw
in
a
very
little
salt
to
make
the
sediment
settle
and
when
it
is
it
should
not
boil
fast
at
any
time
but
simmer
gently
until
clear
through
a
close
cloth
into
jars
do
not
squeeze
the
cloth
so
long
as
the
clear
fat
will
run
through
and
when
you
do
press
the
refuse
into
a
different
vessel
to
be
used
for
commoner
purposes
than
the
other
most
of
the
lard
in
general
use
is
however
made
from
the
fatty
portions
of
pork
lying
next
the
skin
of
the
hog
and
are
left
for
this
purpose
by
the
butcher
scrape
from
the
rind
and
cut
all
into
dice
fill
a
large
pot
putting
in
a
teacupful
of
water
to
prevent
scorching
and
melt
very
slowly
stirring
every
few
minutes
simmer
until
there
remains
nothing
of
the
meat
but
fibrous
bits
remove
these
carefully
with
a
perforated
skimmer
throw
in
a
little
salt
to
settle
the
fat
and
when
it
is
clear
strain
through
a
fine
cullender
a
sieve
or
a
coarse
cloth
dip
the
latter
in

water
should
it
become
clogged
by
the
cooling
lard
observe
the
directions
about
squeezing
the
strainer
if
your
family
is
small
bear
in
mind
that
the
lard
keeps
longer
in
small
than
large
vessels
set
away

jars
closely
covered
in
a
cool
dry
cellar
or
in

the
chief
danger

of

gently

i
will
name
one
or
two
methods
which
i
know
have
been
successful
i
hang
mine
on

from

at

of

which
is
tight
and
dark
says
an
excellent
judge
and
manufacturer
of
hams
they
are
good
and
sweet
when
a
year
another
admirable
housekeeper
covers
with
brown
paper
then
with
coarse
muslin
stitched
tightly
and
fitting
closely
then
whitewashes
but
for
the
paper
the
lime
would
be
apt
to
eat
away
the
grease
still
another
covers
with
muslin
and
coats
with
a
mixture
of
and
rosin
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
covers
are
an
excellent
always
that
the
insects
have
not
already
deposited
their
eggs
in
the
meat
the

thousand
times
your
she
mother
sister
or
intimate
be
enraptured
at
your
unexpected
appearance
in
hand
at
her
door
to
pass
a
day
a
night
or
a
month
or
may
be
pleasantly
surprised
when
you
take
the
baby
and
run
in
to
tea
in
a
social
way
but
the
chances
are
so
greatly
in
favor
of
the
probability
that
you
will
upset
her
household
arrangements
abrade
her
temper
or
put
her
to
undue
trouble
or
embarrassment
by
this
evidence
of
your
wish
to
have
her
feel
quite
easy
with
you
to
treat
you
as
one
of
the
family
that
it
is
hardly
worth
your
while
to
risk
so
much
in
order
to
gain
so
little
partington
has
said
more
silly
things
than
any
other
woman
of
her
age
in
this
country
but
she
spoke
wisely
in
declaring
her
preference
for
those
when
people
sent
word
they
were

not
be
ashamed
to
say
to
your
nearest
kin
or
the
confidante
of
your

let
me
know
when
to
look
for
you
that
i
may
so
order
my
time
and
engagements
as
to
secure
the
greatest
possible
pleasure
from
your
if
you
are
the
woman
i
take
you
to
industrious
and
ruling
your
household
according
to
just
and
firm
laws
of
order
and
punctuality
you
need
this
notice
if
you
are
likewise
social
and
hospitable
your
rules
are
made
with
reference
to
possible
and
desirable
interruptions
of
this
nature
it
only
requires
a
little
closer
packing
of
certain
duties
an
easy
exchange
of
times
and
seasons
and
leisure
is
obtained
for
the
right
enjoyment
of
your
friend
s
society
the
additional
place
is
set
at
table
your
spare
bed
which
yesterday
was
tossed
into
a
heap
that
both
mattresses
might
be
aired
and
covered
lightly
with
a
thin
spread
is
made
up
with
fresh
sheets
that
have
not
gathered
damp
and
must
from
lying
packed
beneath
blankets
and
coverlets
for
may
be
a
month
for
fear
somebody
might
happen
in
to
pass
the
night
and
catch
you
with
the
bed
in
disorder
towels
and
water
are
ready
the
room
is
bright
and
dustless
the
dainty
dish
so
far
prepared
for
dinner
or
tea
as
to
be
like
bagnet

greens
off
your
mind
john
knows
whom
he
is
to
see
at
his
the
children
are
clean
and
on
the
s
instincts
are
always
hospitable
the
guest
s
welcome
is
half
given
in
the
air
of
the
house
and
the
family
group
before
you
have
time
to
utter
a
word
it
may
have
appeared
to
her
a
useless
formality
to
despatch
the
note
or
telegram
you
insisted
upon
she
knows
you
love
her
and
she
would
be
wounded
by
the
thought
that
she
could
ever
come
amiss
to
your
home
perhaps
as
she
lays
aside
her
she
smiles
at
your
ceremonious
ways
and
marvels
that
so
good
a
manager
should
deem
such
forms
necessary
with
an
old
friend
if
she
had
driven
to
your
house
at
nightfall
to
discover
that
you
had
gone
with
husband
and
children
to
pass
several
days
with
john
s
mother
in
a
town
fifty
miles
away
and
that
the
servants
were
out
in
the
mistress
absence
if
she
had
found
you
at
home
nursing
three
children
through
the
measles
she
having
brought
her
youngest
with
her
if
you
were
yourself
the
invalid
bound
hand
and
foot
to
a
procrustean
couch
and
utterly
unable
even
to
see
meanwhile
being
incapacitated
from
playing
the
part
of
agreeable
host
by
worry
and
anxiety
if
on
the
day
before
her
arrival
your
chambermaid
had
gone
off
in
a
tiff
leaving
you
to
do
her
work
and
to
nurse
your
cook
sick
in
the
third
story
if
earlier
comers
than
herself
had
filled
every
spare
mattress
in
the
house
any
one
of
these
or
a
dozen
other
ills
to
which
housekeepers
are
heirs
had
impressed
upon
her
the
idea
that
her
visit
was
inopportune
she
might
think
better
of
your
but
since
visitors
will
occasionally
drop
in
upon
the
best
regulated
families
make
it
your
study
to
receive
them
gracefully
and
cordially
if
they
care
enough
for
you
to
turn
aside
from
their
regular
route
to
tarry
a
day
or
night
or
week
with
you
it
would
be
churlish
not
to
show
appreciation
of
the
favor
in
which
you
are
held
make
them
welcome
to
the
best
you
can
offer
at
so
short
a
notice
and
let
no
preoccupied
air
or
troubled
smile
bear
token
to
your
you
are
perturbed
if
you
respect
yourself
and
your
husband
the
appointments
of
your
table
will
never
put
you
to
the
blush
john
who
buys
the
silver
glass
china
and
napery
is
entitled
to
the
use
of
the
best
you
may
hope
this
is
holiday
set
of
each
put
away
beyond
the
reach
of
hourly
accidents
but
if
this
is
fit
for
the
use
of
a
lord
do
not
make
john
eat
three
hundred
and
sixty
days
in
the
year
from
such
ware
as
would
suit
a
ditcher
s
cottage
if
your
children
never
see
bright
silver
unless
when
there
is
company
you
can
not
wonder
although
you
will
be
mortified
at
their
making
of
the
bowls
of
the
spoons
and
handling
the
forks
awkwardly
early
impress
upon
them
that
what
is
nice
enough
for
papa
is
nice
enough
for
the
president
i
have
noticed
that
where
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
family
and
company
table
furniture
there
usually
exists
a
corresponding
disparity
between
and
company
manners
especially
let
your
welcome
be
ready
and
hearty
when
your
husband
brings
home
an
unexpected
guest
take
care
he
understands
clearly
that
this
is
his
prerogative
that
the
rules
by
which
you
would
govern
the
visits
of
your
own
sex
are
not
applicable
to
his
men
rarely
set
seasons
for
their
visits
they
snatch
an
hour
or
two
with
an
old
chum
or
new
friend
out
of
the
hurry
of
business
life
as
one
stoops
to
pluck
a
stray
violet
from
a
dusty
roadside
john
must
take
his
chances
when
he
can
get
them
if
he
can
walk
home
arm
in
arm
with
the
he
has
not
seen
before
in
ten
years
not
only
fearlessly
but
gladly
anticipatory
of
your
pleasure
at
the
sight
of
his
if
when
the
stranger
is
presented
to
you
you
receive
him
as
your
friend
because
he
is
your
husband
s
and
seat
him
to
a
family
dinner
plain
but
nicely
served
and
eaten
in
cheerfulness
of
heart
if
the
children
are
and
your
attire
that
of
a
lady
who
has
not
lost
the
desire
to
look
her
best
in
her
husband
s
have
added
to
the
links
of
steel
that
knit
your
husband
s
heart
to
you
increased
his
affectionate
admiration
for
the
best
little
woman
in
the
world
many
a
man
has
been
driven
to
entertain
his
friends
at
hotels
and
because
he
dared
not
take
them
home
without
permission
from
the
presiding
officer
of
his
household
the
majority
of
healthy
men
have
good
appetites
and
are
not
disposed
to
be
critical
of
an
unpretending
bill
of
fare
the
chance
guest
of
this
sex
is
generally
an
agreeable
addition
to
the
family
group
instead
of
supposing
him
to
be
john
s
friend
as
to
party
and
your
safest
rule
is
to
obey
the
usage
of
the
community
in
which
you
live
in
minor
points
letting
common
sense
and
your
means
guide
you
in
essentials
be
chary
of
undertaking
what
you
can
not
carry
through
successfully
pretension
is
the
ruin
of
more
entertainments
than
ignorance
or
lack
of
money
if
you
know
how
to
give
a
large
evening
party
and
think
it
a
pleasant
and
remunerative
investment
of
time
and
several
hundred
dollars
you
understand
the
machinery
of
a
handsome
and
can
afford
these
luxuries
go
forward
bravely
to
success
but
creep
before
you
walk
study
established
customs
in
the
best
managed
houses
you
visit
take
counsel
with
experienced
friends
now
and
then
make
modest
essays
on
your
own
responsibility
and
insensibly
these
crumbs
of
wisdom
will
form
into
a
comely
loaf
there
is
no
surer
coin
a
guests
than
a
heated
anxious
hostess
who
betrays
her
inexperience
by
nervous
glances
abstraction
in
conversation
and
worst
of
all
by
apologies
a
few
general
observations
are
all
i
purpose
to
offer
as
hints
of
a
foundation
upon
which
to
build
your
plans
for
have
an
abundance
of
clean
plates
silver
knives
laid
in
order
in
a
convenient
place
as
an
or
pantry
designed
for
each
course
if
your
entertainment
is
a
dinner
upon
a
shelf
or
stand
by
themselves
and
make
your
waiters
understand
distinctly
in
advance
in
what
order
these
are
to
be
brought
on
soup
should
be
sent
up
accompanied
only
by
bread
and
such
sauce
as
may
be
fashionable
or
suitable
before
dinner
is
served
however
snatch
a
moment
if
possible
to
inspect
the
table
in
person
or
instruct
a
trustworthy
factotum
to
see
that
everything
is
in
place
the
water
in
the
goblets
a
slice
of
bread
laid
upon
a
folded
napkin
at
each
plate
unless
you
have
trained
professional
waiters
this
is
a
wise
precaution
if
it
is
a
gentleman
s
dinner
you
can
see
to
it
for
yourself
since
you
will
not
be
obliged
to
appear
in
the
parlor
until
a
few
minutes
before
they
are
summoned
to
the
if
there
are
ladies
in
the
company
you
must
not
leave
them
to
return
then
to
our
soup
it
is
not
customary
to
offer
a
second
plateful
to
a
guest
when
the
table
is
cleared
the
fish
should
come
in
with
other
vegetable
unless
it
be
stewed
tomatoes
after
a
thorough
change
of
plates
come
the
substantials
if
possible
the
carving
of
game
and
other
meats
is
done
before
they
are
brought
in
one
or
more
vegetables
are
passed
with
each
meat
course
salad
is
a
course
of
itself
unless
when
it
accompanies
chicken
or
pigeon
if
wine
be
used
it
is
introduced
after
the
fish
pastry
is
the
first
relay
of
dessert
and
puddings
may
be
served
from
the
other
end
of
the
table
next
appear
creams
jellies
cakes
and
the
like
then
fruit
and
nuts
lastly
coffee
often
accompanied
with
crackers
and
cheese
wine
of
course
goes
around
during
the
it
flows
at
all
evening
parties
are
less
troublesome
to
a
housekeeper
because
less
ceremonious
than
dinners
if
you
can
afford
it
the
easiest
way
to
give
a
large
one
is
to
put
the
whole
business
into
the
hands
of
the
profession
by
intrusting
your
order
not
only
for
supper
but
waiters
and
china
to
a
competent
confectioner
but
a
social
standing
supper
of
oysters
sandwiches
coffee
jellies
and
cake
is
not
a
formidable
undertaking
when
you
have
had
a
little
practice
especially
if
your
own
or
john
s
mother
or
the
nice
neighborly
matron
over
the
way
will
assist
you
by
her
advice
and
presence
the
ladies
lunch
and
afternoon
are
social
and
graceful
modern
we
make
this
matter
of
company
too
hard
a
business
in
america
are
too
apt
to
treat
our
friends
as
the
strasburgers
do
their
geese
shut
them
up
in
overheated
quarters
and
stuff
them
to
repletion
our
rooms
would
be
better
for
more
air
our
guests
happier
had
they
more
liberty
and
our
hostess
would
be
prettier
and
more
sprightly
were
she
not
overworked
before
the
arrivals
begin
and
full
of
trepidation
after
they
come
woman
cumbered
with
many
thoughts
of
serving
while
she
is
supposed
to
be
enjoying
the
society
of
her
chosen
associates
it
is
so
well
understood
that
company
is
weariness
that
inquiries
as
to
how
the
principal
agent
in
bringing
about
an
assembly
has
borne
it
have
passed
into
a
custom
the
tender
sympathies
manifested
in
such
queries
the
air
with
which
they
are
answered
can
not
fail
to
bring
to
the
satirical
mind
the
chinaman
s
comment
upon
the
british
officers
dancing
on
shipboard
in
warm
weather
why
you
no
make
your
servants
do
so
hard
work
and
you
look
at
dem
we
pervert
the
very
name
and
meaning
of
hospitality
when
we
pinch
our
families
wear
away
our
patience
and
waste
our
nervous
forces
with
our
husbands
money
in
getting
up
to
order
expensive
entertainments
for
comparative
strangers
whose
utmost
acknowledgment
of
our
efforts
in
their
behalf
will
consist
in
an
invitation
a
year
hence
it
may
be
to
a
party
constructed
on
the
same
plan
managed
a
little
better
or
a
little
worse
than
ours
this
is
not
hospitality
without
grudging
but
a
vulgar
system
of
barter
and
gluttony
more
worthy
of
abyssinians
than
christian
gentlefolk
game
venison
i
once
received
a
letter
from
the
wife
of
an
eastern
man
who
had
removed
to
the
great
west
in
which
bitter
complaints
were
made
of
the
scarcity
of
certain
and
candy
among
which
she
had
been
accustomed
in
other
days
my
husband
shot
a
fine
deer
this
morning
she
wrote
but
i
could
never
endure
can
you
tell
me
of
any
way
of
cooking
it
so
as
to
make
it
tolerably
eatible
i
did
not
think
it
very
singular
that
one
whose
chief
craving
in
the
goodly
land
in
which
she
had
found
a
home
was
for
cocoanut
cakes
and
chocolate
caramels
should
not
like
the
viand
the
name
of
which
she
could
not
spell
nor
did
i
wonder
that
she
failed
to
make
it
eatible
or
doubt
that
her
cooking
matched
her
orthography
but
i
am
amazed
often
at
hearing
really
skilful
housewives
pronounce
it
an
undesirable
dish
in
the
hope
of
in
some
measure
correcting
this
impression
among
eastern
cooks
who
it
must
be
allowed
rarely
taste
really
fresh
venison
i
have
written
out
with
great
care
and
particularity
the
following
receipts
most
of
which
i
have
used
in
my
own
family
with
success
and
satisfaction
the
dark
color
of
the
meat

now
not
the
black

rich
flesh
objectionable
to
the
uninitiated

to
the
gourmand

then
rub
all
over
with

a

the
carrot
is
preferable
in

lofty

i

declare
that
when

him
up

the

stood
in

should
be
basted
with
melted
butter
seasoned
with
pepper
the
largest
snipe
will
not
require
above
twenty
minutes
to
roast
woodcock
this
is
the
most
delicious
of
small
birds
and
may
be
either
roasted
or
broiled
the
english
do
not
draw
woodcock
regarding
the
as
a
and
i
have
known
american
housekeepers
who
copied
them
in
this
respect
in
this
case
roast
precisely
as
you
would
snipe
or
plover
only
putting
the
toast
under
the
birds
so
soon
as
they
begin
to
cook
to
catch
the
trail
to
my
taste
a
better
and
certainly
to
common
sense
people
a
less
objectionable
plan
is
to
fill
the
birds
with
a
rich
of
peppered
and
salted
shortened
with
melted
butter
sew
them
up
and
roast
basting
with
butter
and
water
from
twenty
minutes
to
half
an
hour
when
half
done
put
circular
slices
of
buttered
toast
beneath
and
serve
upon
these
when
you
take
them
up
split
down
the
back
and
broil
over
a
clear
fire
butter
pepper
and
salt
when
done
and
let
them
lie
between
two
hot
dishes
for
five
minutes
before
sending
to
table
small
snipe
are
nice
broiled
in
this
way
also
robins
and
doves
salmi
of
woodcock
or
snipe
clean
and
the
birds
cut
in
quarters
and
put
in
a
saucepan
with
gravy
made
of
the
giblets
necks
and
some
bits
of
fat
pork
stewed
in
a
little
water
add
a
minced
button
onion
salt
and
a
pinch
of
cayenne
and
stew
fifteen
minutes
or
until
tender
closely
covered
take
out
the
birds
and
pile
neatly
upon
buttered
toast
in
a
strain
the
gravy
and
return
to
the
fire
adding
some
small
pieces
of
butter
rolled
in
flour
the
juice
of
a
lemon
and
a
little
wine
boil
up
and
pour
over
the
salmi
ortolans
rail
and
sora
may
be
roasted
or
broiled
a
good
way
is
to
roll
an
oyster
in
melted
butter
then
in
seasoned
with
pepper
and
salt
and
put
into
each
bird
before
roasting
baste
with
butter
and
water
three
times
put
the
rounds
of
toast
underneath
and
baste
freely
with
melted
butter
they
will
require
about
twenty
minutes
to
cook
and
will
be
found
delicious
to
keep
game
from
tainting
draw
so
soon
as
they
come
into
your
possession
rinse
with
soda
and
water
then
with
pure
cold
water
wipe
dry
and
rub
them
lightly
with
a
mixture
of
fine
salt
and
black
pepper
if
you
must
keep
them
some
time
put
in
the
cavity
of
each

a
piece
of
charcoal
hang
them
in
a
cool
dark
place
with
a

thrown
over

unless
there
are
too
many
of
them
may
be
kept
in

have

the

is

and
here
comes
a
conflict
of
authorities
says
my
kind
friend
and
neighbor
an
excellent
i
boil
my
potatoes
in
cold
water
a
pinch
of
salt
of
course
and
when
throw
away
the
boiling
water
and
fill
up
with
cold
then
boil
again
this
makes
the
potatoes
whose
reputation
as
a
housekeeper
and
cook
is
in
every
kitchen
interposes
i
have
tried
both
ways
my
experience
is
that
potatoes
melt
into
a
sort
of
starchy
gruel
when
boiled
in
cold
water
the
philosophy
of
the
operation
is
to
heat
quickly
and
thoroughly
and
the
instant
they
are
done
to
dry
out
every
drop
of
water
with
a
touch
of
pardonable
we
generally
have
delightful
this
is
true
but
remembering
that
s
are
like
snow
hillocks
ready
to
crumble
at
a
breath
i
come
home
and
try
the
cold
water
plan
my
cook
unlike
most
of
her
tribe
is
too
sensible
to
suppose
that
she
knows
everything
and
willingly
abets
me
the
result
of
our
experiments
stands

to
dissolve

off

we

it
justly
earned
a
reputation
for
grossness
and
indigestibility
that
banished
it
in

from
many
tables

it
is
a
savory
and

article
of

you
are
an
excellent
judge
between
the
true
and
false
that
sounds
somewhat
like
the
advice
of
the
careful
mother
to
her
son
touching
the
wisdom
of
never
going
near
the
water
until
he
learned
how
to
the
caution
can
hardly
be
stated
too
strongly
not
being
ambitious
of
martyrdom
even
in
the
cause
of
gastronomical
enterprise
especially
if
the
instrument
is
to
be
a
contemptible
fungus
i
never
eat
or
cook
native
mushrooms
but
i
learned
years
ago
in
rambles
how
to
distinguish
the
real
from
the
spurious
article
shun
low
damp
shady
spots
in
your
quest
the
good
mushrooms
are
most
plenty
in
august
and
september
and
spring
up
in
the
open
sunny
fields
or
commons
after
fogs
or
soaking
dews
the
top
is
a
dirty
white

or
salmon
changing
to
russet
or
brown
soon
after
they
are
gathered
the
poisonous
sport
all
colors
and
are
usually
far
prettier
than
their
virtuous
kindred
those
which
are
above
and
below
as
well
as
the
stalk
are
also
to
be
let
alone
cook
a
peeled
white
onion
in
the
pot
with
your
mushrooms
if
it
turn
black
throw
all
away
and
be
properly
thankful
for
your
escape
it
is
also
deemed
safe
to
reject
the
mess
of
wild
pottage
if
in
stirring
them
your
silver
spoon
should
blacken
but
i
certainly
once
knew
a
lady
who
did
not
discover
until
hers
were
eaten
and
partially
digested
that
the
silver
had
come
to
grief
in
the
discharge
of
duty
it
was
very
dark
and
required
a
deal
of
rubbing
to
restore
cleanliness
and
polish
but
the
death
were
indeed
in
the
slow
in
its
effects
since
she
lived
many
years
after
the
experiment
it
is
as
well
perhaps
though
not
to
repeat
it
too
often
to
eatable
ones

round
when
they
first
show
their
heads
in
a
critical
world
as
they
grow
the
lower
part

lining
of
salmon
fringe
while
the
stalk
and
top
are
dirty
white
when
the
mushroom
is
more
than
hours
old
or
within
a
few
hours
after
it
is
gathered
the
salmon
changes
to
brown
the
skin
can
also
be
more
easily
peeled
from
the
edges

eggs
to

frame
the

eye
if
you
can

looks

chances
are
in

of
the
egg
and
the
buyer
or
shake
it
gently
at
your
ear
if
addled
it
will
gurgle
like
water
if
there
is
a
chicken
inside
you
may
distinguish
a
slight
thud
against
the
sides
of
the
egg
or
still
again
you
may
try
eggs
from
your
own
by
putting
them
into
a
pan
of
cold
water
the
freshest
sink
first
those
that
float
are
worse
the
best
plan
is
to
break
them
in
making
cake
or
anything
that
requires
more
than
one
break
each
over
a
saucer
that
it
may
be
alone
in
its
condemnation
if
bad
reject
doubtful
ones
without
hesitation
yield
implicit
trust
or
none
at
all
keep
eggs
in
a
cool
not
cold
place
pack
in
bran
or
salt
with
the
small
end
downward
if
you
wish
to
use
within
two
or
three
weeks
and
furthermore
take
the
precaution
to
grease
them
well
with
linseed
oil
or
wash
them
over
with
a
weak
solution
of
gum
tragacanth
or
varnish
this
excludes
the
air
another
way
is
to
make
some
pretty
strong
allowing
a
pound
of
lime
to
a
gallon
of
boiling
water
when
perfectly
cold
fill
a
large
jar
with
it
in
which
you
have
packed
the
eggs
small
end
downward
lay
a
light
saucer
upon
the
top
to
keep
them
under
water
and
keep
in
a
cool
place
renew
the
every
three
weeks
you
may
add
an
ounce
of
saltpetre
to
it
eggs
for
boiling
may
be
canned
as
follows
so
soon
as
they
are
brought
in
from
the
nests
put
two
or
three
dozen
at
a
time
in
a
deep
pan
pour
scalding
water
over
them
let
it
stand
thirty
seconds
and
turn
it
all
off
cover
immediately
with
more
scalding
water
and
repeat
the
process
yet
the
third
time
wipe
dry
and
pack
in
bran
or
salt
when
they
cool
this
hardens
the
albumen
into
an
case
for
the
yolk
of
course
you
can
not
use
these
eggs
for
cake
or
syllabubs
or
anything
that
is
prepared
with
whipped
eggs
pack
with
the
small
end
down
boiled
eggs
put
into
a
saucepan
of
water
with
a
tablespoon
not
to
break
or
crack
them
only
a
slovenly
cook
or
a
careless
one
drops
them
in
with
her
fingers
boil
steadily
three
minutes
if
you
want
them
if
hard
another
way
is
to
put
them
on
in
cold
water
and
let
it
come
to
a
boil
which
will
be
in
ten
minutes
the
inside
white
and
yolk
will
be
then
of
the
consistency
of
custard
many
gourmands
like
them
best
thus
still
another
is
to
put
them
in
one
of
the
silver
used
on
the
a
covered
bowl
will
do
as
well
cover
them
with
boiling
water
and
let
them
stand
three
minutes
pour
this
off
and
refill
with
more
also
boiling
hot
and
leave
them
in
it
five
minutes
longer
wrap
in
a
napkin
in
a
deep
dish
if
you
have
not
a
regular
dropped
or
poached
eggs
strain
some
boiling
water
into
a
which
must
also
be
perfectly
clean
the
least
impurity
will
mar
the
whiteness
of
the
eggs
when
the
water
boils
break
the
eggs
separately
into
a
saucer
take
the
off
and
slip
the
eggs
one
by
one
carefully
upon
the
surface
when
all
are
in
put
back
over
the
fire
and
boil
gently
three
minutes
take
out
with
a
perforated
skimmer

and
add
to
the

with
a
little

slip
your

of

taking
the

from

minutes
and
a
half

lay
on

in
a
hot

turn
the

from

and
pour
in

prevent
burning
and
add
a
great
spoonful
of
butter
some
pepper
and
salt
boil
up
once
and
pour
over
the
eggs
a
better
way
still
is
to
heat
the
milk
in
a
separate
saucepan
that
the
eggs
may
not
have
to
stand

a
cool
cellar
is
the
best
place
in
which
to
keep
milk
if
you
have
no
dairy
or
strain
it
into
broad
shallow
pans
which
are
lukewarm
from
recent
scalding
you
can
get
them
made
in
one
piece
with
no
seams
in
which
sour
cream
or
dirt
may
lurk
unsuspected
set
upon
swing
shelves
to
avoid
the
possibilities
of
drowned
mice
and
keep
the
cellar
dark
to
save
it
from
flies
in
twelve
hours
skim
for
the
table
and
unless
you
have
need
of
the
milk
let
it
stand
twelve
hours
more
for
the
second
rising
of
cream
put
this
into
the
stone
jar
or
crock
in
which
the
cream
is
kept
for
churning
even
in
i
have
found
it
a
good
plan
to
take
off
at
night
the
cream
clean
from
the
morning
churning
instead
of
letting
it
stand
hours
as
is
the
usual
custom
the
second
rising
will
repay
one
for
the
additional
trouble
churn
as
soon
as
convenient
after
the
cream
loppers
or
thickens
if
it
stands
too
long
it
becomes
bitter
or
musty
the
churn
should
be
well
scalded
and
aired
between
the
churnings
scrupulous
cleanliness
should
be
the
unbending
rule
of
dairy
arrangements
all
substances
must
be
kept
from
the
neighborhood
of
milk
and
butter
they
are
ready
absorbents
and
when
they
contract
odor
or
taste
never
get
rid
of
it
have
earthen
and
tin
milk
vessels
and
never
allow
them
to
be
put
to
any
other
use
scald
the
churn
and
cool
with
ice
or
spring
water
pour
in
the
thick
cream
churn
rather
fast
until
the
left
by
the
dasher
upon
the
top
show
that
the
end
to
be
gained
is
more
slowly
the
motion
should
always
be
regular
in
warm
weather
pour
a
little
cold
water
into
the
churn
should
the
butter
come
slowly
take
it
up
with
the
perforated
dasher

it
dexterously
just
below
the
surface
of
the
to
catch
every
stray
bit
have
ready
some
clean
cold
water
in
a
deep
wooden
tray
and
into
this
plunge
the
dasher
when
you
draw
it
from
the
churn
the
butter
will
float
off
leaving
the
dasher
free
having
collected
every
particle
gather
behind
a
wooden
and
drain
off
the
water
squeezing
and
pressing
the
butter
with
the
shovel
set
in
a
cool
place
for
an
hour
to
necessary
measure
in
work
and
knead
it
with
a
wooden
ladle
until
not
another
drop
of
water
exudes
and
the
butter
is
like
yellow
marble
in
polish
and
closeness
of
pores
when
you
have
worked
out
the
add
by
degrees
fine
salt
in
the
proportion
of
a
dessertspoonful
to
every
pound
then
set
aside
for
some
hours
in
a
cool
place
the
last
working
is
a
slight
affair
comparatively
still
using
the
paddle
and
never
from
beginning
to

of
the
operation

the

is
seldom

can
be
had
in
every
country
store
at
the
expense
to
an
amateur
of
making
it
but
remembering
that
it
may
be
a
pleasant
if
not
profitable
experiment
for
the
mistress
of
many
cows
to
make
at
her
odd

i
have
secured
what
purports
to
be
an
exact
description
of
on
a

gallon
of

in
which
rennet
has
been
boiled

and
set

this
should
be
at
the
most
not
more
than
of
an
hour
when
the
whey
has
separated
entirely
and
looks
clear
and
greenish
wash
your

gently
press
all

into

and
hang
it
up
to
dry
until
not
another

then
put
the

this
is
the
cheese
sold
in
this
country
under
the
name
of
bread
if
eminence
of
importance
entitled
a
subject
to
of
position
that
of
which
we
are
now
about
to
speak
should
have
stood
foremost
in
this
work
it
is
not
a
pleasant
thing
to
think
or
write
about
but
it
is
a
stubborn
fact
that
upon
thousands
of
tables
in
otherwise
comfortable
homes
bread
is
an
unknown
phenomenon
i
say
phenomenon
because
it
would
indeed
be
a
marvellous
estrangement
of
cause
and
effect
were
indifferent
flour
unskillfully
mixed
with
flat
yeast
badly
risen
and
negligently
baked
to
result
in
that
pride
of
the
notable
sweet
wholesome
bread
i
know
a
household
where
sour
stiff
bread
is
the
rule
varied
several
times
during
the
week
by
muffins
scented
and
colored
with
soda
clammy
biscuit
and
leathery
another
where
the
bread
is
invariably
and
consequently
tasteless
sometimes
slightly
acid
yet
another
in
which
bread
is
not
used
at
all
because
it
is
so
troublesome
and
uncertain
the
mistress
preferring
to
feed
her
family
growing
children
and
all
upon
the
sponges
bought
at
the
inflated
with
sal
volatile
flavorless
and
dry
as
chips
when
a
day
old
and
too
often
betraying
in
the
dark
streaks
running
through
the
interior
of
the
loaf
want
of
cleanliness
in
the
kneader
yet
these
are
all
people
who
submit
to
these
abominations
partly
because
they
do
not
know
how
badly
off
they
because
it
is
their
way
of
doing
and
they
see
no
reason
for
changing
i
have
been
a
housekeeper
for
thirty
years
and
have
always
mixed
my
bread
just
so
retorted
a
mistress
once
when
i
mildly
set
forth
the
advantages
of
setting
a
sponge
i
put
in
flour
yeast
and
milk
if
i
have
it
and
give
them
a
good
stir
then
set
the
dough
down
to
rise
our
folks
don
t
fancy
very
light
bread
there
don
t
seem
to
be
any
substance
in
to
speak
mine
generally
turns
out
pretty
nice
it
s
all
luck
after
all
about
i
m
told
you
have
a
receipt
for
making
bread
laughed
another
to
me
i
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
my
life
and
i
ve
been
keeping
house
eighteen
years
so
i
thought
i
d
call
and
ask
you
for
as
a
curiosity
you
know
i
want
to
see
what
it
is
i
wisely
kept
thoughts
to
myself
and
dictated
the
receipt
which
she
jotted
down
in
a
laughing
all
the
while
at
the
excellent
you
really
use
this
she
demanded
when
this
was
done
i
do
i
have
used
no
other
for
many
and
the
bread
i
ate
upon
your
table
the
other
night
was
made
according
to
this
again
an
affirmative
answer
i
guess
your
cook
could
tell
another
story
rejoined
the
skeptic
you
can
t
make
me
believe
that
bread
is
made
by
rule
i
put
my
materials
together
anyhow
and
i
have
as
good
luck
as
most
of
my
i
regarded
my
visitor
as
an
impertinent
simpleton
but
i
have
been
amazed
in
subsequent
years
at
finding
that
her
creed
is
that
of
hundreds
of
housewives
more
or
less
sensible
luck
rules
the
baking
and
upon
the
shoulders
of
this
invisible
are
laid
the
deficiencies
of
the
complacent
cook
cheap
flour
and
laziness
are
at
the
bottom
of
more
mishaps
in
the
bread
line
than
any
other
combination
of
circumstances
from
the
inferior
grades
of
flour
it
is
possible
to
make
tolerable
biscuit
crumpets
and
muffins
plain
pastry
and
very
good
you
can
not
by
any
stretch
of
art
produce
excellent
bread
from
poor
flour
it
is
no
economy
to
purchase
it
for
this
purpose
it
judicious
to
lay
in
two
barrels
at
a
time
and
to
use
the
best
only
for
the
or
baking
chiefest
then
among
the
conditions
to
good
bread
i
place
good
family
elastic
and
odorless
whiteness
is
a
secondary
consideration
although
to
american
eyes
this
is
a
recommendation
a
little
experience
will
teach
you
to
detect
the
signs
that
foretell
satisfactory
and
if
in
handling
the
flour
you
discern
a
heaviness
like
that
of
ground
plaster
if
in
squeezing
a
handful
tightly
you
discover
that
it
retains
the
imprint
of
palm
and
fingers
and
rolls
back
into
the
tray
a
compact
ball
or
roll
if
it
is
in
the
least
musty
or
sour
use
it
very
sparingly
in
your
for
the
chances
are
as
ten
to
one
that
you
will
head
the
barrel
up
again
and
return
it
to
your
grocer
sometimes
new
flour
can
be
ripened
for
use
by
sifting
enough
for
each
baking
into
a
large
tray
and
exposing
it
to
the
hot
sun
for
some
hours
or
by
setting
it
upon
the
kitchen
hearth
for
the
same
time
and
it
not
unfrequently
happens
that
flour
improves
greatly
after
the
barrel
has
been
open
for
several
days
or
weeks
it
dries
out
and
becomes
lighter
more
elastic
next
in
importance
to
the
quality
of
the
flour
is
that
of
the
yeast
this
should
be
light
in
color
and
lively
effervescing
easily
when
shaken
and
emitting
an
odor
like
weak
ammonia
if
dull
or
sour
it
is
bad
in
cities
it
is
easiest
perhaps
cheapest
to
buy
yeast
from
a
brewery
or
bakery
exercising
your
discrimination
as
to
quality
unless
you
can
satisfy
yourself
in
this
regard
you
had
better
make
your
own
i
can
confidently
recommend
the
receipts
given
in
this
work
as
easy
and
safe
having
tried
them
in
my
own
family
novices
in
and
many
who
should
have
learned
better
by
long
experience
fall
into
a
sad
mistake
in
the
consistency
of
the
dough
it
should
be
mixed
as
as
it
can
be
bread
will
rise
sooner
and
higher
be
lighter
and
more
digestible
and
keep
fresh
much
longer
if
this
rule
be
followed
stiff
bread
is
close
in
texture
often
waxy
to
the
teeth
and
after
a
day
or
so
becomes
very
hard
set
the
dough
to
rise
in
a
moderately
warm
place
and
keep
it
in
an
even
temperature
there
is
force
in
the
old
my
bread
took
cold
last
cold
arrests
the
process
of
fermentation
there
is
a
chance
should
this
occur
that
a
removal
to
a
more
genial
atmosphere
and
careful
nursing
may
cure
the
congestion
should
it
be
only
partial
too
much
heat
carries
forward
the
work
too
rapidly
in
this
case
you
will
find
your
dough
puffy
and
sour
correct
the
latter
evil
by
dissolving
a
little
soda
or
saleratus
in
hot
water
and
working
it
well
in
knead
your
bread
faithfully
and
from
all
sides
until
it
rebounds
like
after
a
smart
blow
of
the
fist
upon
the
centre
of
the
mass
the
oven
should
not
be
too
hot
if
you
can
not
hold
your
bare
arm
within
it
while
you
count
thirty
it
is
too
quick
keep
the
heat
steady
after
the
bread
goes
in
too
much
fire
at
first
and
rapidly
cooling
produce
the
effect
upon
the
bread
which
is
technically
called
the
inside
of
the
loaf
is
never
properly
done
practice
and
intelligent
observation
will
in
time
make
you
an
adept
in
the
management
of
your
ovens
if
the
bread
rises
rapidly
while
baking
and
the
crust
begins
to
form
before
the
lower
part
of
the
loaf
is
baked
cover
the
top
with
clean
paper
until
you
are
ready
to
brown
it
grate
away
the
burned
portions
of
the
crust
should
there
be
such
this
is
better
than
chipping

a
knife

the

strew
a

spoonfuls
of

over

the
question
of
the
quantity
of
flour
is
a
delicate
one
requiring
judgment
and
experience
various
brands
of
flour
are
so
unequal
with
respect
to
the
quantity
of
gluten
they
contain
that
it
is
impossible
to
give
any
invariable
rule
on
this
subject
it
will
be
safe
however
to
sift
two
quarts
and
a
pint
if
you
have
set
the
two
quarts
for
the
plain
this
will
make
two
loaves
make

middle
of

the

if
your

are
in
good
condition
one
hour
should
bake
the
above
quantity
of

but
here
again
experience
must
be
your
guide
note
carefully
for
yourself
how
long
a
time
is
required
for
your
first
successful
baking
as
also
how
much
dry
flour
you
have
worked
into
your
sponge
and
let
these
data
regulate
future
action
i
have
known
a
variation
of
two
quarts
in
a
large
baking
over
the
usual
measure
of
flour
i
need
not
tell
you
that
you
had
better
shun
a
brand
that
requires
such
an
excessive
quantity
to
bring
the
dough
to
the
right
consistency
it
is
neither
nutritious
nor
economical
when
you
make
out
the
loaves
prick
the
top
with
the
fork
do
not
make
your
first
baking
too
large
practice
is
requisite
to
the
management
of
an
unwieldy
mass
of
dough
let
your
be
with
say
half
the
quantity
of
sponge
and
flour
i
have
set
down
and
increase
these
as
skill
and
occasion
require
carefully
preserving
the
proportions
seven
or
eight
quarts
of
flour
will
be
needed
for
the
baking
of
a
family
of
moderate
size
if
i
have
seemed
needlessly
minute
in
the
directions
i
have
laid
down
it
is
because
i
wish
to
be
a
guide
not
a
betrayer
and
because
i
am
deeply
impressed
with
the
worth
of
such
advice
as
may
tend
to
diminish
the
number
of
those
who
know
not
for
themselves
the
comfort
and
delight
of
eating
from
day
to
day
and
year
to

good
family
bread
family

i
wish
it
were
in

power
by
much
and
earnest
speaking

induce
every
housekeeper
to
make

bread
made
of
unbolted
usually
called
graham
staple
article
of
diet
in
her
family
i
only
repeat
the
declaration
of
a
majority
of
our
best
chemists
and
physicians
when
i
say
that
our
american
fondness
for
fine
white
bread
is
a
serious
injury
to
our
health
we
bolt
and
rebolt
our
flour
until
we
extract
from
it
of
its
nutritive
qualities
leaving
little
strength
in
it
except
what
lies
in
gluten
or
starch
and
consign
that
which
makes
bone
and
tissue
which
regulates
the
digestive
organs
and
leaves
the
blood
pure
the
brain
clear
to
the
lower
animals
growing
children
especially
should
eat
brown
bread
daily
it
supplies
the
needed
phosphate
to
the
tender
teeth
and
bones
if
properly
made
it
soon
commends
itself
to
their
taste
and
white
becomes
insipid
in
comparison
dyspeptics
have
long
been
familiar
with
its
dietetic
virtues
and
were
the
use
of
it
more
general
we
should
have
fewer
wretches
to
mourn
over
the
destroyed
coats
of
their
stomachs
it
is
wholesome
sweet
honest
and
should
be
popular
prepare
a

for

my
rule
is
to
take
out
a
certain
quantity
of
the
risen
sponge
on

set

put
into

up

and
when
it
is
mixed
add
for

size
half
a

of
molasses
the
dough
should
be
soft
if
there
is
not
enough
of
the
sponge
to
reduce
it
to
the
desired
consistency
add
a
little
water
knead
it
diligently
and
long
it
will
not
rise
so
rapidly
as
the
white

having
more
body
to
carry
let
it
take
its
time
make
into
round
comfortable
loaves
and
set
down
again
for
the
second
rising
when
you
have
again
kneaded
it
bake
steadily
taking
care
it
does
not
burn
and
do
not
cut
while
hot
the
result
will
well
repay
you
for
your
trouble
it
will
take

the

for

handed

afraid
to
say
how
many
generations
in

i
first
ate
this

is
to
divide

leaving

soft

set
them
in

still
obeying
the
traditions
of

elders
put
them
in

hang
them
up

many
as
you
need

you
can
not
easily
procure
the
former
let
them
soak

soft
take

drain
them

invalids
and
children
crave
them
eagerly
indeed
i
have
seen
few
refuse
them
who
had
ever
tasted
them
before
there
is
a
pastoral
flavor
about
the
pleasant
dish
eaten
with
the
accompaniment
of
fresh

appeals

there
is
a

difference
between
the
ground
at

and
that
which
is
sent
out
from
northern
mills
if
any
one
doubts
this
it
is
not
she
who
has
perseveringly
tried
both
kinds
and
demonstrated
to
her
own
conviction
that
the
same
treatment
will
not
do
for
them
an
intelligent
lady
once
told
me
that
the
shape
of
the
particles
composing
the
meal
was
one
being
round
and
smooth
the
other
angular
i
am
inclined
to
believe
this
the
southern
meal
is
certainly
coarser
and
the
bread
made
from
it
less
compact
moreover
there
is
a
partiality
at
the
north
for
yellow
meal
which
the
southerners
regard
as
only
fit
for
chicken
and
the
yellow
may
be
the
sweeter
but
i
acknowledge
that
i
have
never
succeeded
in
making
really
nice
bread
from
it
indian
meal
should
be
purchased
in
small
quantities
except
for
a
very
large
family
it
is
apt
to
heat
mould
and
grow
musty
if
kept
long
in
bulk
or
in
a
warm
place
if
not
sweet
and
dry
it
is
useless
to
expect
good
bread
or
cakes
as
an
article
of
diet
especially
in
the
early
warm
days
of
spring
it
is
healthful
and
agreeable
often
acting
as
a
gentle
corrective
to
bile
and
other
disorders
in
winter
also
it
is
always
acceptable
upon
the
breakfast
or
supper
table
being
warming
and
nutritious
in
summer
the
free
use
of
it
is
less
judicious
on
account
of
its
laxative
properties
as
a
kindly
variation
in
the
routine
of
fine
white
bread
and
baker
s
rolls
it
is
worth
the
attention
of
every
housewife
john
and
the
children
will
like
it
if
it
approximates
the
fair
standard
of
excellence
and
i
take
it
my
good
who
have
patiently
kept
company
with
me
from
our
prefatory
talk
until
you
love
them
well
enough
to
care
for
their
comfort

likings
my

is
wild
about

bread
a
wife
remarked
to
me
not
a
hundred
years
ago
but
i
won
t
make
it
for
him
it
is
such
a
bother
and
if
i
once
indulge
him
he
will
give
me
no

i
am

better

so
trifling
in
its
consequences
you
need
not
tire
further
your
aching
back
and
feet
to
accomplish
preparation
of
john
s
favorite
dish
when
he
does
not
expect
the
surprise
him
when
he
comes
in
cold
and
hungry
by
setting
before
him
a
dish
of
hot
or
a
loaf
of
corn
bread
brown
and
crisp
without
yellow
and
spongy
within
instead
of
the
stereotyped
pile
of
cold
slices
brown
or
white
if
he
were
consulted
he
would
say
like
the
generous
soul
he
don
t
take
one
needless
step
for
me
and
he
would
mean
it
but
for
all
that
he
will
enjoy
your
little
and
love
you
the
better
for
it
it
is
the
little
by
little
that
makes
up
the
weal
and
woe
of
life
may
i
make
this
digression
longer
yet
by
telling
you
what
i
overheard
a
husband
say
to
a
wife
the
other
day
when
he
thought
no
one
else
was
near
enough
to
hear
him
he
is
no
gourmand
but
he
is
very
partial
to
a
certain
kind
of
cruller
which
nobody
else
can
make
he
thinks
so
well
as
his
little
wife
it
so
chanced
that
in
frying
some
of
them
she
scalded
her
hand
badly
after
it
was
bandaged
she
brought
up
a
plate
of
the
cakes
for
luncheon
he
looked
at
them
then
at
her
with
a
loving
mournful
smile
i
can
understand
now
said
he
how
david
felt
when
his
brought
him
the
water
from
the
well
of
then
he
stooped
and
kissed
the
injured
fingers
yet
he
has
been
married
twenty
years
i
was
not
ashamed
that
my
eyes
were
moist
i
honored
him
the
more
that
his
were
dim
this
is
my
lesson

the

shaping

way
is
to

is
thus
steamed

instead
of
moulding

try
out
some

it
is
a
mistake
besides
being
slovenly
and
wasteful
to
put
on
more
grease
than
is
absolutely
necessary
to
prevent
the
cake
from
sticking
a
piece
of
pork
an
inch
square
should
last
for
several
days
put
on
a
great
spoonful
of

test
it
with

to
be
sure
that
all
is
right
with
it
as
well
as
the

the

cake
use
none
but
the
best
materials
for
making

if
you
can
not
afford
to
get
good
flour
dry
white
sugar
and
the
best
family
butter
make
up
your
mind
to
go
without
your
cake
and
eat
plain
bread
with
a
clear
conscience
there
are
no
intermediate
degrees
of
quality
in
eggs
i
believe
i
have
said
that
somewhere
else
but
it
ought
to
be
repeated
just
here
they
should
be
like
cæsar
s
wife
above
suspicion
a
tin
whisk
or
whip
is
best
for
beating
them
the
dover
is
the
best
in
the
market
all
kinds
of
cake
are
better
for
having
the
whites
and
yolks
beaten
separately
beat
the
former
in
a
large
shallow
dish
until
you
can
cut
through
the
froth
with
a
knife
leaving
as
clear
and
distinct
an
incision
as
you
would
in
a
solid
substance
beat
the
yolks
in
an
earthenware
bowl
until
they
cease
to
froth
and
thicken
as
if
mixed
with
flour
have
the
dishes
too
cold
it
is
hard
to
whip
whites
stiff
in
a
warm
room
stir
the
butter
and
sugar
to
a
cream
cakes
often
fail
because
this
rule
is
not
followed
beat
these
as
faithfully
as
you
do
the
eggs
warming
the
butter
very
slightly
if
hard
use
only
a
silver
or
wooden
spoon
in
doing
this
do
not
use
fresh
and
stale
milk
in
the
same
cake
it
acts
as
disastrously
as
a
piece
of
new
cloth
in
an
old
garment
sour
milk
makes
a
spongy
cake
sweet
one
closer
in
grain
study
the
moods
and
tenses
of
your
oven
carefully
before
essaying
a
loaf
of
cake
confine
your
early
efforts
to
and
the
like
baked
in
shallow
flat
tins
is
good
practice
during
the
novitiate
keep
the
heat
steady
and
as
good
at
bottom
as
top
streaks
in
cake
are
caused
by
unskilful
mixing
too
rapid
or
unequal
baking
or
a
sudden
decrease
in
heat
before
the
cake
is
quite
done
don
t
delude
yourself
and
maltreat
those
who
are
to
eat
your
cake
by
trying
to
make
soda
do
the
whole
or
most
of
the
duty
of
eggs
others
have
tried
it
before
with
unfortunate
results
if
curiosity
tempt
you
to
the
experiment
you
had
better
allay
it
by
buying
some
at
the
corner
bakery
test
whether
a
cake
is
done
by
running
a
clean
straw
into
the
thickest
part
it
should
come
up
clean
do
not
leave
the
open
or
change
the
cake
from
one
oven
to
the
other
except
in
extreme
cases
if
it
harden
too
fast
on
the
top
cover
with
paper
it
should
rise
to
full
height
before
the
crust
forms
except
for
gingerbread
use
none
but
white
sugar
always
sift
the
flour
be
accurate
in
your
weights
and
measures
is
no
royal
road
to
good
fortune
in
what
is
worth
doing
at
all
is
worth
doing
there
is
no
disgrace
in
not
having
time
to
mix
and
bake
a
cake
you
may
well
be
ashamed
of
yourself
if
you
are
too
lazy
or
careless
or
hurried
to
beat
your
eggs
cream
your
butter
and
sugar
or
measure
your
ingredients
yet
sometimes
when
you
believe
you
have
left
no
means
untried
to
deserve
success
failure
is
your
portion
what
then
if
the
cake
be
uneatable
throw
it
away
upon
the
first
who
comes
for
broken
meat
and
say
nothing
about
it
if
streaky
or
burned
cut
out
the
best
parts
make
them
presentable
as
possible
and
give
them
to
john
and
the
children
as
a
treat
then
keep
up
a
brave
heart
and
try
again
you
not
satisfy
yourself
in
a
dozen
trials
you
certainly
not
if
you
never
make
another
attempt
cake
should
be
wrapped
in
a
thick
cloth
as
soon
as
cool
and
kept
in
tight
tin
boxes
do
not
cut
more
at
a
time
than
you
are
likely
to
use

it

before
let

your

whites
of
eggs
pound
powdered
white
sugar

or

break
the
whites
into
a

clean
cool
dish
throw
a
small
handful
of
sugar
upon
them
and
begin
whipping
it
in
with
slow
steady
strokes
of
the
beater
a
few
minutes
later
throw
in
more
sugar
and
keep
adding
it
at
intervals
until
it
is
all
used
up
beat
perseveringly
until
the
icing
is
of
a
smooth
fine
and
firm
texture
half
an
hour
s
beating
should
be
sufficient
if
done
well
if
not
stiff
enough
put
in
more
sugar
a
little
practice
will
teach
you
when
your
end
is
gained
if
you
season
with
allow
in
measuring
your
sugar
for
the
additional
liquid
or
a
very
little
tartaric
acid
whitens
the
icing
use
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
sugar
for
each
egg
this
method
of
making
icing
was
taught
me
by
a
confectioner
as
easier
and
surer
than
the
old
plan
of
beating
the
eggs
first
and
alone
i
have
used
no
other
since
my
first
trial
of
it
the
frosting
hardens
in
the
time
required
under
the
former
plan
and
not
more
than
half
the
time
is
consumed
in
the
manufacture
i
have
often
iced
a
cake
but
two
hours
before
it
was
cut
and
found
the
sugar
dry
all
through
pour
the
icing
by
the
spoonful
on
the
top
of
the
cake
and
near
the
centre
of
the
surface
to
be
covered
if
the
loaf
is
of
such
a
shape
that
the
liquid
will
settle
of
itself
to
its
place
it
is
best
to
let
it
do
so
if
you
spread
it
use
a
knife
dipped
in
cold
water
if
it
is
as
thick
with
sugar
as
it
should
be
you
need
not
lay
on
more
than
one
coat
you
may
set
it
in
a
moderate
oven
for
three
minutes
if
you
are
in
great
haste
the
better
plan
is
to
dry
in
a
sunny
window
where
the
air
can
get
at
it
and
where
there
is
no
dust
color
icing

putting
the
grated
peel
of
a
lemon

the
lady
from

had
this
admirable

was
celebrated
among
her
acquaintances
for
her
beautiful
and
delicious

should
always
be
baked

she
said
to
me
once
sportively

it

not
taste
just
the

were
like
a
large
brick
in

with
almost
perpendicular
sides
i
instantly
gave
an
order
for
a
couple
precisely
like
them
and
really
fancied
that
cake
baked
in
them
was
a
little
better
than
in
any
other
form
but
you
can
hardly
fail
of
success
if
you
prepare
yours
precisely
as

have
directed

will
be
careful
that

the
best
butter
in
pastry
cooking
butter
is
a
good
thing
said
a
grave
epicure
to
me
once
an
admirable
its
place
which
is
in
the
kettle
or
upon
it
is
certainly
out
of
place
in
biscuits
cake
or
in
any
substance
destined
for
human
palates
and
stomachs
it
is
never
less
in
place
than
in
pastry
never
betrays
its
vileness
more
surely
and
odiously
butter
intended
for
pastry
should
be
washed
carefully
in
several
clear
cold
waters
and
kneaded
while
under
water
to
extract
the
salt
then
wipe
it
dry
and
lay
it
in
a
cold
place
until
you
are
ready
to
work
it
in
keep
cool
is
a
cardinal
motto
for
a
marble
slab
is
a
good
thing
to
roll
out
paste
upon
next
to
this
the
best
article
is
a
board
of
hard
wood
which
is
never
used
for
any
other
purpose
it
is
harder
to
make
good
pastry
in
warm
weather
than
cold
on
account
of
the
tendency
of
the
butter
to
oil
and
thus
render
the
crust
heavy
and
solid
few
people
know
what
really
good
pastry
is
fewer
still
can
make
it
it
has
no
inevitable
resemblance
either
to
putty

pork
fat
and
pies
kill
more
people
yearly
in
the
united
states
than
do
liquor
and
tobacco
said
a
popular
lecturer
upon
conservatism
perhaps
so
but
i
incline
to
the
belief
that
bad
pastry
is
answerable
for
a
vast
majority
of
the
murders
not
that
i
recommend
pies
of
any
description
as
healthful
daily
of
all
for
children
but
since
they
are
eaten
freely
all
over
our
land
let
us

as

take

roll
out
again
as
thin
as
before
baste
roll
up
and
then
out
until
your

it
is
a
good
plan
to
sprinkle
the
inside

some

read
a
lively
little
book
entitled
the
greatest
plague
of

have
forgotten
who
wrote
it
if
i
ever
knew
it
was
in
the
form
of
an
autobiography
the
heroine
called
herself
with
an
amusing
affectation
of
disguise
and
it
was
illustrated
by
george
cruikshank
i
read
it
aloud
in
my
and
many
a
hearty
laugh
we
had
over
the
poor
lady

perplexities
and
calamities
regarding
the
history
as
a
clever
burlesque
i
suffered
no
appreciable
draught
upon
my
sympathies
until
time
and
experience
brought
me
in
contact
with
so
many
who
echoed
her
plaint
that
i
could
not
but
recur
now
and
then
with
a
smile
to
her
sufferings

the
rule

chased

rallied
bravely

whipped

upset

in

my

a

they
would

the
class
who

up

i
had
a
lesson
on
this
head
not
a
month
since
my
laundress
who
has
lived
with
me
six
years
was
thanking
me
for
a
service
i
had
done
her

i

never

cut
my
sentence
in
the
middle
by
walking
out
of
the
supposed
to
conceal
her
emotions
i
was
undeceived
five
minutes
later
when
her
angry
tones
reached
me
from
the
kitchen
the
door
of
which
she
had
left
open
i
ll
never
believe
a
person
has
a
good
heart
or
deserves
to
be
called
a
christian
who
names
an
honest
respectable
girl
who
tries
to
do
her
duty
a
a
faithful
servant
says
she
as
if
she
was
a
queen
and
meself
a
beggar
what
did
you
say
to
the
ungrateful
wretch
asks
a
listener
indignantly
nothing
i
went
quietly
out
of
hearing
reminded
for
the
hundredth
time
of
solomon
s
warning
take
no
heed
unto
all
words
that
are
spoken
lest
thou
hear
thy
servant
curse
i
recalled
too
the
saying
of
a
mightier
than
the
royal
preacher
whosoever
will
be
greatest
among
you
let
him
be
your
i
thought
you
were
one
of
the
favored
few
who
had
no
trouble
with
them
says
another
housekeeper
sighingly
there
is
real
comfort
me
my
dear
it
is
refreshing
to
a
wearied
soul
to
know
that
you
have
felt
some
of
our
tribulations
it
seems
to
me
at
times
that
there
is
no
other
affliction
worthy
the
name
when
compared
with
what
we
endure
from
the
necessary
i
have
tried
all
representatives
from
every
nation
under
heaven
i
verily
are
all
they
will
wear
me
into
an
untimely
grave
i
wouldn
t
let
them
my
dear
martha
replies
sterling
with
her
sunny
smile
if
evils
they
are
surely
minor
afflictions
and
after
all
i
imagine
they
are
a
good
deal
like
the
rest
of
man
and
much
as
you
choose
to
take
them
the
truth
is
there
is
no
justice
in
wholesale
denunciation
of
any
class
you
recollect
the
western
orator
s
truism
human
nature
president
nine
cases
out
of
ten
is
human
when
i
consider
the
influences
under
which
a
majority
of
our
servants
have
been
poverty
superstition
often
evil
example
in
their
wonder
is
not
at
the
worthlessness
of
some
but
that
so
many
are
virtuous
honest
and
orderly
you
will
allow
that
as
a
general
thing
they
are
quite
as
industrious
as
their
mistresses
and
control
their
tempers
almost
as
well
and
we
make
so
many
mistakes
in
our
dealings
with
them
my
old
friend
does
not
often
lecture
but
she
has
something
to
say
now
and
forgets
herself
in
her
subject
we
err
so
grievously
in
our
management
that
a
sense
of
our
failures
should
teach
us
charity
do
we
understand
ourselves
what
is
the
proper
place
of
a
hired
help
in
our
families
if
it
is
the
disposition
of
mrs
shoddy
to
trample
upon
them
as
soulless
machines
kindly
makes
a
sort
of
elder
daughter
of
her
maid
indulges
consults
and
confides
in
her
and
wonders
to
find
herself
under
abigail
s
husband
and
children
subject
to
the
caprices
of
a
pampered
menial
i
never
hear
a
lady
say
of
a
valued
domestic
i
could
not
get
along
without
her
without
anticipating
as
a
certainty
the
hour
when
she
shall
announce
there
such
a
thing
as
keeping
a
servant
too
the
crisis
comes
then
to
kindly
in
a
moment
of
desperation
she
frees
her
neck
from
the
yoke
abigail
packs
her
six
trunks
having
entered
kindly
s
service
seven
years
before
with
her
worldly
all
done
up
in
a
newspaper
shakes
the
dust
off
the
neat
balmoral
boots
which
have
replaced
her
brogans
against
the
heartless
tyrant
who
sits
crying
in
her
own
room
over
thoughts
of
how
abigail
has
been
so
clean
quick
and
devoted
to
her
interests
how
she
has
nursed
her
through
a
long
and
dangerous
illness
and
had
the
charge
of
emma
and
bobby
from
their
birth
she
has
prepared
a
handsome
present
for
her
in
memory
of
all
this
and
is
hurt
more
than
by
anything
else
when
she
learns
that
the
girl
has
taken
her
final
departure
without
even
kissing
the
baby
it
is
not
strange
that
the
deceived
mistress
should
from
that
day
write
down
abigail
a
monster
of
ingratitude
and
forget
the
faithful
service
of
years
in
the
smart
of
wounded
feeling
when
the
truth
is
that
she
did
the
maid
more
injury
by
injudicious
petting
than
the
latter
could
do
her
mistress
had
she
absconded
with
all
the
plate
in
the
house
she
has
as
might
have
been
expected
proved
abigail
s
unfitness
to
be
her
confidante
and
but
at
the
same
time
she
has
filled
her
brain
with
notions
of
her
superiority
to
her
her
heart
with
burnings
for
the
higher
station
she
can
never
occupy
i
speak
feelingly
upon
this
subject
continues
sterling
with
a
laugh
for
i
was
once
led
into
this
very
mistake
myself
by
the
attractive
qualities
of
a
young
woman
who
lived
with
me
nine
years
as
seamstress
and
chambermaid
she
was
so
so
sensible
industrious
and
respectful
that
she
gained
upon
the
esteem
of
us
all
one
day
while
we
sat
together
at
work
i
told
her
of
some
family
changes
in
prospect
prefacing
the
communication
by
the
remark
i
want
to
speak
to
you
of
something
eliza
which
you
must
not
mention
to
any
one
else
at
present
the
interests
of
an
employer
and
a
servant
should
be
the
then
very
foolishly
i
opened
up
my
mind
freely
on
the
subject
that
engaged
it
she
answered
modestly
but
intelligently
entering
into
my
plans
with
such
cordial
interest
and
pledges
of
that
i
went
to
prepare
for
a
walk
feeling
really
strengthened
and
cheered
by
the
talk
at
the
front
door
i
was
met
by
a
letter
requiring
an
immediate
reply
returning
to
my
chamber
to
lay
off
my
hat
and
shawl
i
heard
eliza
talking
loudly
and
gleefully
in
the
adjoining
with
the
cook
whom
she
must
have
called
through
the
you
can
not
imagine
nor
i
describe
my
sensations
at
listening
against
my
will
to
an
exaggerated
account
of
the
interview
which
had
just
taken
place
not
only
my
language
but
my
tones
were
mimicked
with
great
gusto
and
much
laughter
by
my
late
phrase
the
interests
of
the
employer
and
the
servant
should
be
the
same
occurring
again
and
again
and
forming
apparently
the
cream
of
the
joke
i
was
very
angry
but
for
the
rule
adopted
early
in
my
married
life
never
to
reprove
a
servant
when
out
of
humor
i
should
instantly
have
ordered
the
treacherous
i
named
the
house
i
sat
down
instead
to
cool
off
and
to
think
with
reflection
common
sense
rallied
to
my
aid
the
girl
does
well
enough
in
her
place
which
is
that
of
a
hired
chambermaid
and
seamstress
said
this
monitor
she
knew
her
position
and
would
have
kept
it
but
for
your
folly
in
dragging
her
up
to
temporary
equality
with
yourself
you
made
yourself
ridiculous
and
she
was
shrewd
enough
to
see
it
take
the
lesson
to
heart
write
it
out
in
full
for
future
guidance
and
keep
your
own
eliza
never
suspected
my
discovery
she
remained
with
me
until
her
marriage
a
year
afterward
and
we
parted
upon
good
i
have
quoted
from
my
friend
at
length
because
i
honor
her
excellent
judgment
and
mature
experience
and
because
i
agree
so
fully
with
her
touching
the
evil
of
confidential
servants
the
principle
of
acknowledged
favoritism
is
ruinous
to
domestic
comfort
let
who
may
be
the
object
thus
distinguished
rely
upon
it
my
dear
lady
at
least
one
third
of
and
social
scandal
arises
from
this
cause
be
assured
also
that
if
you
do
not
perceive
the
impropriety
of
lowering
yourself
to
the
level
of
your
subordinates
will
and
gauge
their
behaviour
accordingly
the
connection
is
an
unnatural
one
and
like
all
others
of
the
kind
must
terminate
disastrously
in
time
then
the
discarded
favorite
aggrieved
and
exasperated
leaves
your
house
to
tattle
in
the
ears
of
some
other
indiscreet
mistress
of
your
sayings
and
doings
show
your
servant
that
you
respect
yourself
and
her
too
truly
to
forget
what
is
due
to
both
be
kind
pleasant
always
reasonable
and
attentive
to
her
needs
willing
to
hearken
to
and
meet
any
lawful
request
make
her
comfortable
and
so
far
as
you
can
happy
excuse
one
more
quotation
from
sterling
whom
when
i
was
much
younger
than
i
am
now
i
consulted
with
regard
to
the
just
medium
between
familiarity
and
austerity
remember
they
are
human
beings
and
treat
them
as
such
she
said
not
that
you
are
likely
to
reap
a
large
reward
in
their
gratitude
but
because
it
is
right
and
because
you
find
no
exceptions
to
the
practice
of
the
golden
rule
laid
down
in
the
bible
be
faithful
in
your
obedience
to
the
law
of
kindness
with
the
return
tide
you
have
nothing
to
do
this
is
a
safe
and
straight
path
i
believe
it
to
be
also
the
smoothest
you
will
be
better
and
more
cheerfully
served
than
your
neighbor
who
recognizing
in
every
hireling
a
natural
enemy
is
always
on
the
i
have
found
the
most
serious
obstacle
to
a
comfortable
pursuance
of
her
safe
path
to
lie
in
this
same
by
centuries
of
misunderstandings
and
belief
of
necessary
antagonism
between
employers
and
employed
sterling
s
eliza
only
expressed
the
prevailing
sentiment
of
her
class
when
she
ridiculed
her
mistress
proposition
that
their
interests
ought
to
be
identical
i
have
failed
so
often
and
so
signally
in
the
endeavor
to
impress
the
merits
of
this
policy
upon
domestics
that
i
rarely
attempt
it
now
there
is
always
a
or
less
you
have
a
single
eye
to
in
all
your
regulations
and
counsels
what
does
she
hope
to
gain
what
am
i
in
danger
of
losing
are
the
queries
that
invariably
present
themselves
to
the
subordinate
s
mind
the
arguments
by
which
your
plans
are
supported
are
thrown
away
upon
ignorant
and
illogical
array
of
facts
totally
disbelieved
your
auditor
does
not
say
this
but
in
divers
and
ingenious
ways
she
contrives
to
let
you
know
that
she
is
not
so
silly
as
to
be
imposed
upon
by
the
specious
array
of
evidence
for
how
much
of
this
are
mistresses
responsible
has
this
creed
of
distrust
been
learned
by
experience
of
injustice
or
exaction
or
is
it
one
of
the
popular
prejudices
which
are
harder
to
overthrow
than
sound
and
principle
of
one
thing
i
am
certain
mistresses
and
maids
would
more
speedily
come
to
a

for

couldn

as

avoid
talking
about

with
people
whose
gossip
on

topics
is
incessant
you
are
angry
when
a
whiff
of
some
such
discussion
as

with

to
her
mistake
is
wafted
to
you
through
the
or
register
an
accident
that
will
occur
while
the
tones
of
the
plaintiffs
are
loud
and
untrained
by
education
or
policy
it
is
mean
and
in
fact
you
say
for
them
so
to
misrepresent
and
revile
all
the
kindness
you
have
showed
to

too
bridget
chloe
or

passing

sound
of

name
as
roughly
handled
may
have
her
own
sensations
and
draw
her
own
human
like
it
is
tiresome
and
vulgar
this
everlasting
exchange
of
experiences
about
my
girl
and
your
girl
and
everybody
else
s
it
is
time
sensible
women
ceased
in
this
respect
to
imitate
the
fashion
of
the
class
they
censure
and
put
down
the
bootless
tattle
with
a
strong
will
order
your
household
then
so
far
aright
as
you
can
by
the
help
of
common
sense
and
grace
from
on
high
and
let
mesdames
jones
robinson
and
brown
look
to
the
ways
of
their
own
and
expend
their
surplus
energies
upon
their
neighbors
you
out
i
believe
that
is
slang
but
let
it
stand
these
worthy
and
fussy
housewives
act
upon
the
supposition
that
all
girls
are
cast
in
the
same
mould
being
human
do
not
let
us
forget
that
the
probability
is
that
there
are
varieties
of
the
species
but
if
the
mistresses
are
led
by
their
associates
the
girl
s
acquaintances
sway
her
yet
more
powerfully
every
conscientious
housewife
knows
what
a
brake
is
this
informal
but
terrible
union
upon
her
endeavors
to
improve
and
really
benefit
those
under
her
direction
i
have
been
amazed
and
disgusted
at
the
tyranny
exercised
by
this
irresponsible
body
over
the
best
servants
i
have
ever
seen
we
would
be
hooted
at
ma
am
if
we
didn
t
give
in
to
them
said
one
when
i
represented
how
senseless
and
almost
suicidal
was
the
course
recommended
by
these
evil
advisers
there
s
not
a
girl
in
the
town
would
speak
to
us
if
we
didn
t
join
in
with
the
rest
it
s
like
a
strike
you
upon
them
as
holds
do
not
then
my
discouraged
imagine
that
i
am
ignorant
of
your
trials
your
doubts
your
disheartening
experiences
if
i
disagree
with
and
do
not
pronounce
our
servants
to
be
the
greatest
plague
of
life
inclining
rather
to
the
belief
allowing
for
human
nature
and
the
drawbacks
i
have
mistresses
are
apt
to
make
good
servants
it
is
in
consequence
of
long
and
careful
study
and
observation
of
the
practical
working
of
sterling
s
rule
like
begets
like
pleasant
words
are
more
likely
to
be
answered
by
pleasant
than
are
tart
or
hasty
ones
if
you
would
have
your
servants
respectful
to
you
be
respectful
to
them
the
best
way
to
teach
them
politeness
is
by
example
it
should
not
cost
you
an
effort
to
say
thank
you
or
if
you
the
habit
exerts
an
unconscious
refining
influence
upon
them
and
you
dignify
instead
of
degrading
your
ladyhood
by
being
pitiful
and
courteous
to
all
if
you
can
only
maintain
your
position
by
haughtiness
and
chilling
disregard
of
the
feelings
of
inferiors
your
rank
is
false
or
you
unfit
to
hold
it
to
begin
then
be
mistress
of
yourself
amid
all
your
temptations
to
angry
or
sarcastic
speech
and
how
many
and
how
strong
these
are
you
and
i
know
curb
yourself
with
the
recollection
that
it
is
despicable
no
less
than
useless
to
say
cutting
things
to
one
who
has
no
right
to
retort
upon
you
in
kind
ma
says
miss
aurelia
in
miss
sedgwick
s
admirable
story
live
and
let
live
how
can
you
let
your
help
be
so
saucy
to
you
master
julius
who
was
standing
by
took
a
different
view
of
the
matter
if
ma
doesn
t
want
her
help
to
be
to
her
he
said
she
hadn
t
ought
to
be
to
teach
your
children
the
like
forms
of
kindly
speech
and
habits
of
consideration
for
the
comfort
and
happiness
of
your
domestics
checking
with
equal
promptness
undue
freedom
and
the
arrogance
of
station
it
is
as
graceful
to
bend
as
it
is
mean
to
grovel
learn
not
to
see
everything
and
so
soon
as
you
can
put
far
from
you
the
delusive
hope
that
anybody
it
be
dear
old
ever
serve
you
as
well
as
you
would
serve
yourself
this
failure
is
attributable
to
some
one
of
the
we
spoke
of
just
now
she
is
a
prudent
housekeeper
who
can
wink
at
trifling
blemishes
without
effort
or
parade
there
is
one
text
which
has
come
into
my
troubled
mind
hundreds
of
times
on
such
occasions
calming
perturbation
into
solemnity
and
bringing
i
hope
charity
with
if
lord
shouldst
mark
iniquities
o
lord
who
shall
stand
but
if
your
hold
of
the
rein
be
gentle
let
it
also
be
firm
never
forget
that
the
house
is
yours
and
that
responsible
for
the
disposition
of
the
stores
purchased
with
john
s
money
i
was
much
amused
the
other
day
said
an
lady
to
me
at
a
talk
that
passed
under
my
window
between
my
new
cook
and
one
of
her
visitors
and
how
are
ye
gitting
along
asked
the
guest
oh
pretty
now
was
the
reply
i
was
when
i
first
come
that
would
bother
me
down
into
the
kitchen
so
constant
but
i
give
her
a
hint
as
how
that
wasn
t
the
trick
of
a
raal
lady
and
she
s
kep
out
nicely
sence
then
you
ve
got
to
stand
up
for
your
own
rights
in
this
wurrld
or
you
ll
be
trod
now
it
would
be
throwing
away
words
to
reason
with
a
woman
like
that
cook
or
a
mistress
might
show
that
in
no
other
department
of
labor
would
such
a
principle
be
from
the
secretary
of
state
down
to
the
scavenger
who
empties
your
every
employé
who
draws
wages
has
an
overlooker
to
whom
he
is
accountable
for
the
manner
in
which
his
work
is
done
and
his
money
earned
and
that
the
fact
that
she
is
an
ignorant
woman
is
no
just
cause
of
exemption
yet
in
how
many
families
is
this
point
tacitly
yielded
and
the
mistress
admitted
upon
sufferance
to
her
own
room
furnished
with
her
money
and
in
which
she
hardly
dare
touch
or
look
at
the
articles
intended
for
the
consumption
of
her
own
family
one
often
hears
such
remarks
as
it
isn
t
every
girl
who
will
stand
having
the
mistress
popping
in
and
out
while
she
is
at
when
in
any
other
situation
the
very
fact
of
this
unwillingness
to
have
the
owner
of
the
materials
used
in
that
work
present
would
be
strong
presumptive
proof
of
negligence
or
dishonesty
the
principle
is
pernicious
from
beginning
to
end
and
should
not
be
tolerated
for
an
instant
it
gives
me
pleasure
to
state
here
that
i
know
nothing
personally
of
this
curious
reversal
of
the
rights
of
employer
and
domestic
i
am
inclined
to
believe
if
i
hear
of
other
housewives
trials
be
true
that
i
have
been
highly
favored
among
american
women
my
authority
in
the
kitchen
as
in
other
parts
of
the
household
has
never
been
my
hearing
or
presence
that
is
i
have
always
met
with
a
cheerful
reception
when
i
appeared
there
to
direct
or
share
the
labors
of
my
cooks
have
found
them
willing
to
undertake
new
dishes
and
ready
to
learn
my
way
however
unlike
it
might
be
to
their
own
as
a
rule
also
which
the
exceptions
have
been
few
and
very
far
employed
by
me
have
been
cleanly
industrious
and
respectful
patient
under
inconveniences
and
attentive
in
sickness
i
should
not
therefore
do
my
duty
did
i
not
lift
my
voice
in
a
plea
for
charitable
judgment
just
and
generous
treatment
of
a
class
which
however
faulty
have
much
to
do
and
to
endure
skinflint
s
grocer
s
account
may
be
less
than
yours
if
you
adopt
this
sharp
s
be
better
dusted
and
the
paint
in
her
attic
scrubbed
oftener
but
i
believe
in
the
long
run
you
will
be
the
most
comfortable
in
body
as
in
conscience
your
machinery
will
move
with
fewer
jerks
and
less
friction
your
servants
will
remain
with
you
longer
and
be
while
they
stay
if
you
show
that
you
appreciate
the
fact
of
a
common
humanity
that
you
owe
them
duties
you
are
resolved
to
fulfil
during
their
sojourn
under
your
roof
however
mercenary
may
be
their
performance
of
those
devolving
upon
them
finally
dear
sister
do
not
add
to
the
real
miseries
of
life
by
regarding
the
annoyance
of
a
careless
slothful
or
impertinent
domestic
as
a
real
trouble
class
it
with
petty
vexations
which
are
yet
curable
as
well
as
endurable
and
live
above
noble
beneficent
existence
in
the
love
of
your
and
the
fear
of
life
that
can
not
suffer
perceptible
disturbance
from
such
a
contemptible
rootlet
of
bitterness
as
this
it
is
only
the
feeble
the
inefficient
or
the
indolent
mistress
whose
peace
of
mind
is
dependent
upon
such
casualties
as
a
breeze
a
hurricane
or
a
sudden
vacancy
in
the
department
of
the
interior
recollect
when
the
infliction
is
sharpest

boiled
puddings
you
can
boil
puddings
in
a

a

the
mould
should
have
a

be
buttered
and
the
batter
or
dough
is
put
in
these
moulds
are
usually
made
with
hasps
or
other
fastening
in
lack
of
this
you
had
better
tie
down
the
cover
securely
i
once
boiled
a
pudding
in
a
tin
pail
the
top
of
which
i
made
more
secure
by
fitting
it
over
a
cloth
floured
on
the
inside
lest
the
pudding
should
stick
the
experiment
succeeded
admirably
and
i
commend
the
suggestion
to
those
who
find
after
the
pudding
is
mixed
that
their
mould
leaks
or
the
bowl
that
did
duty
as
a

has
been
broken

nothing
said
to

about
it

tie
the

very
tightly
about
the
mouth
of
the
bag
which
must
be
made
with
seams
at
sides
and
bottom
the
better
to
exclude
the
water
the
water
must
be
boiling
when
the
pudding
goes
in
and
not
stop
boiling
for
one
instant
until
it
is
done
if
it
is
in
a
bag
this
must
be
turned
several
times
to
prevent
sticking
or
scorching
to
the
sides
of
the
pot
the
bag
must
also
be
entirely
covered
while
the
water
should
not
quite
reach
to
the
top
of
a
mould
if
you
use
a

dip
the

in

before
dredging

when
the

is
up
take

or
cloth
from
the
boiling
pot
and
plunge
into
cold
water
then
turn
out

the
loss
of
a

this
will
prevent

leave

in

to
save
myself
the
trouble
and
the
reader
the
tedium
of
a
repetition
under
each
receipt
in
olden
times
it
was
a
boast
of
notable
cooks
that
they
could
toss
a
pancake
from
the
pan
out
of
the
top
of
the
chimney
with
such
accuracy
of
calculation
that
it
would
turn
itself
on
the
way
back
and
settle
in
its
place
ready
like
lawrence
to
have
the
other
side
fried
never
saw
a
pancake
tossed
although
in
my
childish
days
i
saw
hundreds
fried
by
the
honorable
so
fast
passing
old
virginia
cooks
i
do
not
advise
this
acrobatic
system
of
culinary
exploit
especially
for
beginners
indeed
i
doubt
if
the
pancakes
would
be
found
equal
to
the
journey
in
these
days
of
tight
and
cooking
stoves
they
must
be
out

is
five
eggs
to
a
quart
of
milk
and
a
tablespoonful
of
sugar
to
each
egg
although
a
good
plain
custard
can
be
made
with
an
egg
for
each
cup
of
milk
and
four
tablespoonfuls
of
sugar
to
the
quart
creams
and
custards
that
are
to
be
frozen
must
have
at
least
more
sugar
than
those
which
are
not
to
undergo
this
process
in
heating
the
milk
for
custard
do
not
let
it
quite
boil
before
adding
the
yolks
my
plan
which
has
proved
a
safe
one
thus
far
is
to
take
the
scalding
milk
from
the
fire
and
instead
of
pouring
the
beaten
eggs
into
it
to
put
a
spoonful
or
two
of
the
milk
to
beating
well
all
the
while
adding
more
and
more
milk
as
i
mix
until
there
is
no
longer
danger
of
sudden
curdling
then
return
all
to
the
fire
and
boil
gently
until
the
mixture
is
of
the
right
consistency
from
ten
to
fifteen
minutes
should
thicken
a
quart
stir
constantly
a
pinch
of
soda
added
in
hot
weather
will
prevent
the
milk
from
curdling
boil
milk
and
custard
in
a
vessel
set
within
another

if
you
have
not
a

or

kettle
improvise
one
by
setting
a
tin
pail
inside
of
a
pot
of
hot
water
taking
care
it
does
not
float
also
that
the
water
is
not
so
deep
as
to
bubble
over
the
top
custards

those
prepared

s
notice
you
can
not
do
better
than
to
purchase
the
best
patent
freezer
you
can
procure
i
had
one
once
which
would
freeze
cream
admirably
in
half
an
hour
i
have
forgotten
the
patentee
s
name
and
perhaps
this
is
well
for
him
since
truth
would
oblige
me
to
record
an
unlucky
habit
his
machine
had
of
getting
out
of
order
just
when
i
wanted
it
to
do
its
best
my
earliest
recollections
of
are
of
the
discordant
grinding
of
the
freezer
among
the
blocks
of
ice
packed
about
monotone
of
misery
that
had
it
been
unrelieved
by
agreeable
associations
of
the
good
to
which
it
was
leading
up
would
not
have
been
tolerated
out
of
bedlam
for
one
two
three
sometimes
four
hours
it
went
on
without
other
variety
than
the
harsher
sounds
of
the
fresh
ice
and
the
rattling
swash
as
the
freezer
plunged
amid
the
icy
brine
when
these
were
nearly
melted
without
cessation
save
when
the
unhappy
operator
nodded
over
his
work
or
was
relieved
by
another
predestined
victim
of
luxury
and
battalion
of
the
laziest
juveniles
upon
the
place
being
detailed
for
this
purpose
i
verily
believed
in
those
days
that
the
freezing
could
not
be
facilitated
by
energetic
action
and
used
to
think
how
fortunate
it
was
that
small
darkies
had
a
predilection
for
this
drowsy
employment
i
shall
never
forget
my
amazement
at
seeing
a
brisk
yankee
housewife
lay
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
ponderous
tin
cylinder
and
whirl
it
with
such
will
and
celerity
back
and
forth
back
and
forth
that
the
desired
end
came
to
pass
in
of
an
hour
that
day
has
gone
by
time
has
grown
too
precious
now
even
to
juvenile
contrabands
for
them
to
sit
half
the
day
shaking
a
freezer

the

the
old
plantation

will
do
the

in

ever
show

i
have
practised

method
with
such
thankfulness

have
ready
a
quantity
of

cracked
in
pieces
not
larger
than
a
pigeon
smaller
the
better
you
can
manage
this
easily
by
laying
a
great
lump
of
ice
between
two
folds
of
coarse
sacking
or
an
old
carpet
tucking
it
in
snugly
and
battering
it
through
the
cloth
with
a
or
mallet
until
fine
enough
there
is
no
waste
of
ice
nor
need
you
take
it
in
your
hands
at
gather
up
the
corners
of
the
carpet
or
cloth
and
slide
as
much
as
you
want
into

use
an

pack
around
it

first
a

then
one

in

order
fill
the

but
before
covering
the
remove
it
carefully
that
none
of
the
salt
may
get
in
and
with
a
long
wooden
ladle
or
flat
stick
i
had
one
made
on
purpose
beat
the

as
you
would
batter
for
five
minutes
without
stay
or
stint
replace
the
lid
pack
the

salt
upon
it
patting
it
down
hard
on
top
cover
all
with
several
folds
of
blanket
or
carpet
and
leave
it
for
one
hour
then
remove
the
cover
of
the
freezer
when
you
have
wiped
it
carefully
outside
you
will
find
within
a
thick
coating
of
frozen
custard
upon
the
bottom
and
sides
dislodge
this
with
your
ladle
which
should
be
thin
at
the
lower
end
or
with
a
long
working
every
particle
of
it
clear
beat
again
hard
and
long
until
the
custard
is
a
smooth
paste
the
smoothness
of
the
depends
upon
your
action
at
this
juncture
put
on
the
cover
pack
in
more
ice
and
salt
and
turn
off
the
brine
spread
the
double
carpet
over
all
once
more
having
buried
the
freezer
out
of
sight
in
ice
and
leave
it
for
three
or
four
hours
then
if
the
water
has
accumulated
in
such
quantity
as
to
buoy
up
the
freezer
pour
it
off
fill
up
with
ice
and
salt
but
do
not
open
the
freezer
in
two
hours
more
you
may
take
it
from

open
it
wrap
a
towel
wrung
out
in

water
about
the
lower
part
and
turn
out

to
the

should
the

melt
very
fast
you
may
have
to
turn
off
the
water
more
than
twice
but
this
will
seldom
happen
except
in
very
hot
weather
you
need
not
devote
fifteen
minutes
in
all
to
the
business
after
the
custard
is
made
you
may
go
into
the
cellar
before
breakfast
having

it

made

doubtless

butler
he
could
have

he
never

can
not
mar

beauty
nor
were
her
fingers
filthy
as
a

could
the
delicate
fruit
suffer
from
them
as
from
your
barbarous
baptism
you
would
like
to
know
who
picked
them
i
should
inquire
instead
who
washed
them
and
in
what
i
recollect
seeing
a
housekeeper
who
was
afflicted
with
your
inquiring
turn
of
mind
wash
strawberries
in
a
basin
currants
and
raspberries
pick
the
currants
from
the
stems
and
mix
with
an
equal
quantity
of
raspberries
put
into

bowl
and
eat

drain
them

repeat
the
dip
in
the

once

twice

lay
them
upon

jellies
use
none

if
the

clean
thoroughly
just
before
you
put

anything
else
stand

fill

instantly
with

perfectly
clean

you
may
mean
to
return
the

to
it
again
in
five
minutes
by
observing
these
precautions
preserves

pickles
made
in
may
be
rendered
as
good

wholesome
as
if

be

use
only

can
not
be
made
to
produce
the

effect
as
dry
white
do
not
hurry
any
needful
step
in
the
process
of
preserving
prepare
your
fruit
with
care
weigh
accurately
and
allow
time
enough
to
do
your
work
well
put
up
the
preserves
in
small
jars
in
preference
to
large
and
when
once
made
keep
them
in
a
cool
dark
closet
that
is
perfectly
dry
keep
jellies
in
small
stone
china
jars
or
glass
tumblers
closely
covered
you
can
procure
at
most
china
and
glass
stores
or

metal
covers
with
elastic
rims
for
these
which
can
be
used
from

with
tissue
paper
double
and
wet
with
brandy
pressed
closely
to
the
conserve
before
you
put
on
the
lid
or
paste
on
the
thick
paper
examine
your
shelves
frequently
and
narrowly
for
a
few
weeks
to
see
if
your
preserves
are
keeping
well
if
there
is
the
least
sign
of
fermentation
boil
them
over
adding
more
sugar
if
jellies
are
not
so
firm
after
six
or
eight
hours
as
you
would
have
them
set
them
in
the
sun
with
bits
of
window
glass
over
them
to
keep
out
the
dust
and
insects
remove
these
at
night
and
wipe
off
the
moisture
collected
on
the
under
sides
repeat
this
every
day
until
the
jelly
shrinks
into
firmness
filling
up
one
cup
from
another
as
need
requires
this
method
is
far
preferable
to
boiling
down
which
both
injures
the
flavor

darkens

these
directions
be
strictly
followed
and
the
fruit
is
at
the
proper
state
of
ripeness
there
need
be
no
dread
of
failure
i
have
often
had
the
jelly
form
before
i
filled
the
last
glass
i
wish
it
were
in
my
power
by
making
known
the
advantages
of
the
process
i
have
described
to
put
an
end
to
the
doubts
and
anxieties
attendant
upon
the
method
of
boiling
jelly
into
a
preserve
this
plan
is
so
simple
and
safe
the
jelly
made
so
superior
in
flavor
and
color
to
that
produced
by
boiling
down
juice
and
fruit
that
no
one
who
has
ever
tried
both
ways
can
hesitate
to
give
it
the
preference
i
have
put
up
jelly
in
no
other
way
for
eighteen
years
and
have
never
failed
once
strawberry
jelly
should
have
a
little
added
to
that
of
the
fruit
both
it
and
blackberry
and
very
ripe
raspberry
jelly
are
apt
to
be
less
firm
than
that
made
from
more
tart
fruits
still
do
not
boil
it
set
it
in
the
sun
as
i
have
directed
at
the
beginning
of
the
section
upon
preserves
and
fruit
jellies
filling
one
cup
from
another
as
the
contents
shrink
the
sun
will
boil
it
down
with
less
waste
and
less
injury
to
color
and
taste
than
the
fire
will
cooking
jelly
always
darkens
it
put
brandied
over
the
top
of

there

this

appearance
and
in
taste
canned
fruits
and
vegetables
within
a
few
years
canned
fruits
have
in
a
great
measure
superseded
preserves
they
are
cheaper
more
wholesome
and
far
less
difficult
to
prepare
attention
to
a
few
general
rules
will
insure
success
to
every
housekeeper
who
sensibly
prefers
to
put
up
her
own
season
s
supply
of
these
to
purchasing
those
for
double
the
cost
which
are
not
nearly
so
good
first
examine
cans
and
elastics
narrowly
before
you
begin
operations
see
that
the
screw
is
in
order
the
can
without
crack
or
nick
the
elastic
firm
and
closely
fitting
secondly
have
the
fruit
boiling
hot
when
sealed
have
upon
the
range
or
stove
a
pan
in
which
each
empty
can
is
set
to
be
filled
after
it
is
rolled
in
hot
water
lay
elastic
and
top
close
to
your
hand
fill
the
can
to
overflowing
remembering
that
the
fruit
will
shrink
as
it
cools
and
that
a
vacuum
invites
the
air
to
enter
clap
on
the
top
without
the
loss
of
a
second
screw
as
tightly
as
you
can
and
as
the
contents
and
the
can
cool
screw
again
and
again
to
fit
the
contraction
of
metal
and
glass
thirdly
if
you
use
glass
cans
and
they
are
cheapest
in
the
end
for
you
can
use
them
year
after
year
getting
new
elastics
when
you
need
them
keep
them
in
a
cool
dark
place
and
dry
as
well
as
cool
the
light
will
cause
them
to
ferment
and
also
change
the
color
canned
berries
heat
slowly
to
boiling
in
a
large
kettle
when
they
begin
to
boil
add
sugar
in
the
proportion
of
one
tablespoonful
to
each
quart
of
fruit
before
doing
this
however
if
there
is
much
juice
in
the
kettle
dip
out
the
surplus
with
a
dipper
or
cup
it
will
only
increase
the
number
of
cans
to
be
filled
without
real
advantage
to
you
leave
the
berries
almost
dry
before
putting
in
the
sugar
this
will
make
syrup

all
together
fifteen
minutes
and
can

put

are
scarcely
inferior

so
soon
as
it
is
pared
the
large
white
freestone

are
nicest
for
this
purpose
firmness
of
texture
is
a
desideratum
the

be

not
soft
allow
a
heaping
tablespoonful
of

the
layers
fill

heat
slowly
to

boil
boil
three
minutes
just
to
assure
yourself
that
every

is
heated
through

and

it
is
safe
to
put

i
don
t
hold
with
any
of
these
notions
said
an
old
lady
to
me
when
i
mentioned
that
my
canning
was
over
for
the
summer
i
was
beguiled
two
years
ago
into
putting
up
some
in
cans
and
if
i
m
forgiven
for
that
folly
i
ll
never
tempt
providence
in
the
same
manner
they
didn
t
keep
then
keep
they
sp
iled
in
a
week
twas
no
more
n
i
expected
and
deserved
for
meddling
with
such
a
perhaps
you
did
not
follow
the
directions
closely
indeed
i
did
i
cooked
the
tormented
things
and
seasoned
em
with
butter
and
salt
all
ready
for
the
table
and
screwed
the
tops
down
tight

in
course
they

were
you
careful
to
put

into

have
cracked

i

avoid

for

is
put

keep
pickles
in

look
them
over

remove
the

if
there
are
several
of

drain
off

scald
the

adding
a
cup
of
sugar
for

and

if
they
are

well
throw
in
a

handful
of
sugar
for

and
tie
them
up

this
tends
to
preserve

mellows

old
if

but
seldom
in
the
section
devoted
to
drinks
it
is
because
most
of
my
information
respecting
their
manufacture
is
in
my
own
family
they
are
so
little
used
except
in
sickness
that
i
should
not
dare
to
teach
others
upon
my
own
authority
how
to
prepare
them
indeed
the
temptation
i
felt
to
omit
many
of
them
reminded
me
of
a
remark
made
introductory
of
preserves
by
one
of
the
complete
housewives
who
all
five
together
drove
me
to
the
verge
of
an
attack
of
congestion
of
the
brain
before
i
had
been
a
housekeeper
for
a
week
said
this
judicious
lady
preserves
of
all
kinds
are
expensive
and
indigestible
and
therefore
poisonous
i
shall
not
give
directions
for
their
manufacture
except
to
remark
that
barberries
stewed
in
molasses
are
economical
and
a
degree
less
hurtful
than
most
others
of
that
class
of
then
i
reflected
that
i
might
upon
the
same
principle
exclude
all
receipts
in
which
cocoanut
is
used
because
it
is
rank
poison
to
me
while
a
dear
friend
of
mine
would
as
soon
touch
arsenic
as
an
egg
a
large
majority
of
the
beverages
i
have
named
are
highly
medicinal
and
deserve
a
place
in
the
housekeeper
s
calendar
on
that
account
many
so
far
from
being
hurtful
are
beneficial
to
a
weak
stomach
or
a
system
suffering
under
general
debility
which
contain
alcohol
in
any
shape
should
be
used
daily
much
less
or
by
a
well
this
principle
reduced
to
practice
would
prove
the
preventive
ounce
which
would
cure
all
over
the
land
the
need
for
temperance
societies
and
inebriate
asylums
the
the
should
be
the
most
quiet
and
cheerful
in
the
sacred
isle
past
which
the
waves
of
domestic
toil
and
solicitude
glide
silently
this
is
not
an
easy
rule
to
obey
whoever
the
invalid
may
be
whether
the
mother
father
or
the
sweet
youngling
of
the
flock
the
foundations
of
the
household
seem
thrown
out
of
course
while
the
sickness
lasts
you
may
have
good
servants
and
kind
friends
to
aid
you
but
the
hitch
in
the
machinery
is
not
to
be
smoothed
out
by
their
efforts
the
irregularity
does
not
annoy
you
you
do
not
notice
it
if
the
attack
be
severe
or
dangerous
all
other
thoughts
are
swallowed
up
in
the
alarm
you
count
nothing
an
inconvenience
that
can
bring
present
relief
or
possible
healing
to
the
beloved
one
disdain
for
yourself
rest
or
ease
while
the
shadow
hangs
above
the
pillow
crushed
by
the
helpless
head
but
when
it
passes
when
the
first
transport
of
thankfulness
has
subsided
into
an
abiding
sense
of
safety
the
mind
swings
back
to
the
accustomed
pivot
and
your
eyes
seem
to
be
suddenly
unbound
you
find
with
dismay
that
the
children
have
run
wild
and
the
comfort
of
the
whole
family
been
neglected
during
your
confinement
to
the
post
of
most
urgent
duty
with
displeasure
that
the
servants
have
as
you
consider
taken
advantage
of
your
situation
to
omit
this
task
and
to
slur
over
that
fine
that
nothing
has
been
done
well
and
so
many
things
left
altogether
undone
that
you
are
worried
out
of
your
senses
phrase
that
too
often
signifies
out
of
your
temper
and
it
is
just
at
this
you
are
called
to
fifty
points
of
attention
and
labor
at
once
and
are
on
the
verge
of
despair
at
the
conglomeration
worse
conglomerated
arising
before
you
fidgetting
to
pick
up
dropped
stitches
in
the
web
you
were
wont
to
keep
so
the
invalid
becomes
most
exacting
unreasonable
you
name
it
to
yourself
even
though
it
be
john
himself
who
calls
upon
you
every
third
minute
for
some
little
office
of
who
wants
to
be
amused
and
fed
and
petted
and
made
generally
comfortable
as
if
he
were
a
baby
who
never
remembers
that
you
must
be
wearied
out
with
watching
and
anxiety
and
that
everything
is
going
to
destruction
for
the
want
of
a
the
better
he
loves
you
the
more
apt
is
he
to
fancy
that
nobody
but
you
can
do
anything
for
him
the
more
certain
to
crave
something
which
no
one
else
knows
how
to
prepare
and
when
you
have
strained
muscle
and
patience
a
further
to
get
it
ready
and
with
prudent
foresight
made
enough
to
last
for
several
meals
it
is
more
than
probable
that
his
fickle
taste
will
suggest
something
entirely
different
for
next
just
for
a
change
you
know
dear
one
gets
so
tired
of
eating
the
same
thing
so
often
he
might
be
more
think
turning
away
that
he
may
not
see
your
change
of
countenance
when
you
have
taken
so
much
pains
to
suit
him
exactly
it
is
harder
yet
when
he
refuses
to
do
more
than
taste
the
delicacy
you
hoped
would
tempt
him
it
is
very
nice
i
suppose
my
love
says
the
poor
fellow
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
but
it
does
not
taste
right
somehow
maybe
the
children
can
dispose
of
it
if
i
had
a
lemon
ice
or
some
wine
jelly
such
as
my
mother
used
to
make
i
am
sure
i
could
relish
it
i
always
did
detest
sick
peoples
diet
if
he
is
very
much
shaken
as
to
nerves
he
will
be
likely
to
say
i
am
fairly
wild
said
a
loving
wife
and
mother
and
thrifty
housekeeper
to
me
one
day
when
i
called
to
see
her
she
had
just
nursed
her
husband
and
three
children
through
the
influenza
all
had
been
down
with
it
at
once
that
form
of
demoniacal
possession
is
generally
conducted
upon
the
wholesale
principle
one
of
her
servants
had
left
in
disgust
at
the
increased
pressure
of
work
the
weather
was
rainy
blowy
raw
the
streets
were
muddy
and
there
was
no
such
thing
as
keeping
steps
and
halls
clean
while
the
four
invalids
were
cross
as
only
toothache
or
influenza
can
make
human
beings
i
am
fairly
wild
said
the
worthy
creature
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
can
not
snatch
a
minute
from
morning
until
night
to
put
things
straight
and
yet
i
am
almost
tired
to
death
i
was
saying
to
myself
as
you
came
in
that
i
wouldn
t
try
any
longer
i
would
just
sit
still
until
the
dirt
was
piled
up
to
my
chin
and
i
would
get
upon
the
table
how
often
i
have
thought
of
her
odd
speech
since
sometimes
with
a
frequently
with
a
sigh
but
with
all
my
pity
for
the
nurse
and
housekeeper
i
can
not
conceal
from
would
not
forget
or
let
you
forget
for
a
truth
that
the
sick
one
is
the
greater
sufferer
it
is
never
pleasant
to
be
laid
upon
the
shelf
the
hard
and
narrow
and
uneven
enough
even
when
the
tramp
of
the
outer
world
does
not
jar
the
sore
and
jaded
frame
when
there
is
no
apparent
need
for
the
sick
person
to
be
upon
his
feet
and
for
aught
that
others
can
see
or
he
can
say
he
might
just
as
well
stay
where
he
is
for
a
month
or
two
but
when
the
rack
of
pain
having
been
removed
the
dulled
perceptions
of
the
mind
to
sensitiveness
and
there
comes
to
his
ear
the
of
imperative
every
idle
moment
speaks
to
him
of
a
slain
opportunity
and
the
no
longer
strong
man
shakes
his
fetters
with
piteous
cries
against
fate
do
not
despise
or
be
impatient
with
him
he
is
feverish
and
inconsiderate
and
capricious
because
he
is
not
himself
you
see
only
the
poor
wreck
left
by
the
demon
as
he
tore
his
way
out
of
him
at
the
divine
command
gather
it
up
lovingly
in
your
arms
and
nurse
it
back
to
strength
and
comeliness
the
sick
should
always
be
the
chief
object
of
thought
and
care
with
all
in
the
if
need
be
let
the
dirt
lie
everywhere
else
so
long
as
it
is
kept
out
of
that
one
room
there
be
jealous
in
your
care
that
nothing
offends
sight
and
smell
there
should
be
smell
in
a
to
avoid
this
let
in
the
air
freely
and
often
will
not
dispel
a
foul
odor
while
disinfectants
are
noisome
in
themselves
bathe
the
patient
as
frequently
and
thoroughly
as
prudence
will
allow
and
change
his
clothing
with
the
every
day
do
not
keep
the
medicines
where
he
can
see
them
nor
ever
let
him
witness
the
mixing
of
that
which
he
is
to
swallow
so
soon
as
his
meals
are
over
remove
every
vestige
of
them
from
the
room
even
a
soiled
spoon
lying
on
table
or
bureau
may
offend
his
fastidious
appetite
cover
the
stand
or
waiter
from
which
he
eats
with
a
spotless
napkin
and
serve
his
food
in
your
daintiest
ware
my
heart
softens
almost
to
tearfulness
when
i
recall
the
hours
days
weeks
i
have
myself
spent
in
the
chamber
of
languishing
and
the
ingenuity
of
tenderness
that
from
my
babyhood
has
striven
to
cheat
the
imprisonment
of
weariness
and
make
me
forget
pain
and
uselessness
the
pretty
surprises
daily
invented
for
my
entertainment
the
exceeding
nicety
with
which
they
were
set
out
before
me
the
loving
words
that
nourished
my
spirit
when
the
body
was
faint
unto
death
are
events
not
slight
incidents
in
the
book
of
memory
when
i
cease
to
be
grateful
for
them
or
to
learn
from
them
how
to
minister
unto
others
of
the
like
consolation
may
my
heart
forget
to
beat
my
right
hand
lose
her
cunning
do
not
ask
your
charge
what
he
would
like
to
eat
he
will
of
a
surety
sicken
with
the
effort
at
selection
and
say
nothing
but
watch
attentively
for
the
slightest
intimation
of
a
desire
for
any
particular
delicacy
and
if
you
are
assured
that
it
can
not
hurt
him
procure
it
if
you
can
without
letting
him
guess
at
your
intention
feed
him
lightly
and
often
never
bringing
more
into
his
sight
than
he
may
safely
eat
a
big
bowl
of
broth
or
jelly
will
either
tempt
him
to
imprudence
or
discourage
him
am
i
to
be
burdened
with
all
that
cries
the
affrighted
stomach
and
will
have
none
of
it
while
he
is
very
weak
feed
him
with
your
own
hand
playfully
as
you
would
a
child
talking
cheerily
of
something
besides
his
food
and
coaxing
him
into
taking
the
needed
nutriment
as
only
a
wife
and
mother
can
or
as
nobody
but
john
could
beguile
you
to
effort
in
the
same
direction
study
all
pleasant
and
soothing
arts
to
while
away
the
time
and
keep
worry
of
every
kind
away
from
him
a
trifle
at
which
you
can
laugh
will
be
a
burden
to
the
enfeebled
mind
and
body
and
he
has
nothing
to
do
but
lie
still
and
roll
it
over
until
it
swells
into
a
mountain
when
he
can
be
removed
without
danger
let
him
have
his
meals
in
another
room
changing
the
air
of
each
when
he
is
not
in
it
every
one
who
has
suffered
from
long
sickness
knows
the
peculiar
loathing
attendant
upon
the
idea
that
all
food
is
tainted
with
the
atmosphere
of
the
chamber
in
which
it
is
served
and
if
eaten
in
bed
tastes
of
the
mattress
and
pillows
the
room
and
all
in
it
may
be
clean
fresh
and
sweet
but
the
fancy
can
not
be
dismissed
and
it
is
wiser
to
humor
than
to
reason
with
most
sick
fancies
a
hired
nurse
is
a
useful
often
a
necessary
thing
but
while
you
are
upon
your
feet
and
mistress
of
your
own
house
delegate
to
no
one
the
precious
task
of
catering
for
the
dear
sufferer
it
is
an
art
in
itself
i
hope
a
practical
knowledge
of
it
will
be
taught
in
women
s
medical
colleges
when
they
are
an
established
institution
with
us
i
wish
it
were
proper
to
record
here
the
name
of
one
of
the
kindest
and
best
family
physicians
i
ever
knew
who
had
charge
of
my
not
very
firm
health
during
my
girlhood
he
owed
suppose
no
one
ever
knew
really
how
his
success
in
his
practice
to
his
tact
and
skill
in
devising
palatable
and
suitable
nourishment
for
his
patients
i
well
remember
the
childish
pleasure
with
which
i
would
hear
him
say
when
the
violence
of
the
attack
had
now
my
dear
child
we
must
begin
with
kitchen
physic
and
the
glow
of
amused
expectation
with
which
i
used
to
watch
him
as
with
an
arch
show
of
mystery
he
would
beckon
my
mother
from
the
room
to
receive
his
prescription
the
impatience
with
which
i
awaited
the
result
of
the
conference
and
the
zest
with
which
i
ate
whatever
he
ordered
if
i
could
have
persuaded
him
to
manage
this
department
of
my
work
it
would
win
for
me

degree

that
cause

more

more

than
the
attempt
to
teach
domestics
how
to
wash
up
dishes
i
ve
heard
that
is
very
about
some
things
such
as
washing
up
dishes
and
the
likes
of
that
said
a
woman
to
me
with
an
affected
laugh
having
called
to
apply
for
the
then
vacant
position
of
cook
in
my
kitchen
she
had
high
recommendations
a
whine
engrafted
upon
her
native
brogue
and
spoke
of
me
in
the
third
trick
of
cheap
and
bogus
gentility
that
tries
my
nerves
and
temper
to
the
very
marrow
of
my
spine
i
was
to
myself
as
i
came
along
that
must
have
been
onlucky
in
her
girls
if
she
had
to
tache
them
how
to
wash
up
dishes
i
always
thought
that
was
one
of
the
things
that
came
nat
to
every
mrs
s
experience
goes
to
prove
that
the
wrong
way
of
doing
this
must
come
natural
to
the
class
mentioned
and
that
nature
is
mighty
in
woman
the
fact
that
the
right
way
is
to
pile
unrinsed
dishes
and
plates
in
a
big
pan
with
a
loose
bit
of
soap
on
top
and
pour
lukewarm
water
over
all
then
with
a
bit
of
rag
to
splash
said
water
over
each
separately
and
make
another
pile
of
them
upon
the
until
the
last
is
drawn
reeking
with
liquid
grease
sticky
and
streaming
from
the
now
filthy
puddle
of
diluted

to
rub
them
lightly
and
leisurely
with
one
they

as
difficult
of
comprehension
to
the
scullionly
mind
as
would
be
a
familiar
lecture
upon
the
yet
the
right
and
only
neat
method
is
so
simple
and
easy
rinse
the
greasy
plates
and
whatever
is
sticky
with
sugar
or
other
sweet
in
hot
water
and
transfer
to
a
larger
pan
of
hot
wash
glass
first
next
silver
then
article
at
a
time
although
you
may
put
several
in
the
pan
have
a

upon

the

to

loiterings

paths
one
volume
books
of
travel
have
multiplied
of
late
years
almost
in
a
direct
ratio
to
the
increased
facilities
for
journeying
and
it
may
be
said
that
the
quality
has
also
proportionately
improved
we
have
works
profusely
adorned
with
superb
illustrations
and
others
without
pictorial
embellishments
relying
for
their
attractiveness
on
the
charm
of
a
skilled
pen
and
the
freshness
of
first
impressions
such
a
book
is
loiterings
in
pleasant
paths
by
marion
harland
whose
books
have
made
her
name
a
household
word
in
every
part
of
the
land
these
familiar
talks
from
afar
are
no
fancy
sketches
but
actual
experiences
and
impressions
of
a
shrewd
observer
whose
mind
was
enriched
and
fully
prepared
to
observe
accurately
and
write
intelligently
and
profitably
marion
harland
always
writes
books
with
a
purpose
and
the
present
volume
is
no
exception
to
her
the
observations
of
so
clever
a
woman
who
carries
her
head
with
her
upon
her
travels
and
ventures
to
make
use
of
all
her
faculties
are
worth
writing
about
and
reading
about
and
this
particular
traveller
has
the
good
gift
of
so
writing
about
them
that
the
reading
is
a
constant
and
unfailing
source
of
those
who
are
going
abroad
will
find
this
volume
a
delightful
companion
by
the
way
while
those
who
are
compelled
to
stay
at
home
will
find
it
the
best
possible
substitute
for
the
pleasure
of
foreign
travel
