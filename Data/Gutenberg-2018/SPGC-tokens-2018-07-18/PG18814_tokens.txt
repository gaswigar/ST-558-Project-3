duncan
macleod
hung
up
the
suit
he
had
taken
off
and
sealed
his
shirt
socks
and
underwear
in
a
laundry
envelope
bearing
his
name
and
tossing
this
into
one
of
the
wire
baskets
provided
for
the
purpose
then
naked
except
for
the
plastic
identity
disk
around
his
neck
he
went
over
to
the
desk
turned
in
his
locker
key
and
passed
into
the
big
room
beyond
four
or
five
young
men
probably
soldiers
on
their
way
to
town
were
coming
through
from
the
other
side
like
macleod
they
wore
only
the
plastic
disks
they
had
received
in
exchange
for
the
metal
ones
they
wore
inside
the
reservation
and
they
were
being
searched
by
attendants
who
combed
through
their
hair
probed
into
ears
and
nostrils
peered
into
mouths
with
tiny
searchlights
and
employed
a
variety
of
magnetic
and
electronic
detectors
to
this
search
macleod
submitted
wearily
he
had
become
quite
a
connoisseur
of
security
measures
in
fifteen
years
research
and
development
work
for
a
dozen
different
nations
but
the
tonto
basin
research
establishment
of
the
philadelphia
project
exceeded
anything
he
had
seen
before
there
were
veterans
of
the
old
manhattan
project
here
men
who
had
worked
with
fermi
at
chicago
or
with
oppenheimer
at
los
alamos
twenty
years
before
and
they
swore
in
amused
exasperation
when
they
thought
of
how
the
relatively
mild
regulations
of
those
days
had
irked
them
and
yet
the
very
existence
of
the
manhattan
project
had
been
kept
a
secret
from
all
but
those
engaged
in
it
and
its
purpose
from
most
of
them
today
in
there
might
have
been
a
few
wandering
tribesmen
in
somaliland
or
the
kirghiz
steppes
who
had
never
heard
of
the
western
union
philadelphia
project
or
of
the
fourth
komintern
red
triumph
plan
or
of
the
islamic
undertaking
or
of
the
confederation
cavor
project
but
every
literate
person
in
the
world
knew
that
the
four
great
were
racing
desperately
to
launch
the
first
spaceship
to
reach
the
moon
and
build
the
lunar
fortress
that
would
insure
world
supremacy
he
turned
in
the
nonmagnetic
identity
disk
at
the
desk
on
the
other
side
of
the
search
room
receiving
the
metal
one
he
wore
inside
the
reservation
and
with
it
the
key
to
his
inside
locker
he
put
on
the
clothes
he
had
left
behind
when
he
had
passed
out
and
filled
his
pockets
with
the
miscellany
of
small
articles
he
had
not
been
allowed
to
carry
off
the
reservation
he
knotted
the
garish
necktie
affected
by
the
civilian
workers
and
in
particular
by
members
of
the
macleod
research
team
to
advertise
their
nonmilitary
status
lit
his
pipe
and
walked
out
into
the
open
gallery
beyond
karen
hilquist
was
waiting
for
him
there
reclining
in
one
of
the
metal
chairs
she
looked
cool
in
the
belted
white
coveralls
with
the
white
turban
bound
around
her
yellow
hair
and
very
beautiful
and
when
he
saw
her
his
heart
gave
a
little
bump
like
a
geiger
responding
to
an
ionizing
particle
it
always
did
that
although
they
had
been
together
for
twelve
years
and
married
for
ten
then
she
saw
him
and
smiled
and
he
came
over
fanning
himself
with
his
sun
helmet
and
dropped
into
a
chair
beside
her
did
you
call
our
center
for
a
jeep
he
asked
when
she
nodded
he
continued
i
thought
you
would
so
i
did
bother
for
a
while
they
sat
silent
looking
with
bored
distaste
at
the
swarm
of
army
riflemen
and
guarding
the
transfer
platforms
and
the
vehicles
gate
a
string
of
trucks
had
been
passed
under
heavy
guard
into
the
clearance
compound
they
were
now
unloading
supplies
onto
a
platform
at
the
other
side
of
which
other
trucks
were
backed
waiting
to
receive
the
shipment
a
hundred
feet
of
bare
concrete
and
fifty
armed
soldiers
separated
these
from
the
men
and
trucks
from
the
outside
preventing
contact
and
still
they
ca
stop
leaks
karen
said
softly
and
we
get
blamed
for
it
macleod
nodded
and
started
to
say
something
when
his
attention
was
drawn
by
a
commotion
on
the
driveway
a
big
tucker
limousine
with
an
paint
job
and
the
flag
of
a
brigadier
general
was
approaching
horning
impatiently
in
the
back
seat
macleod
could
see
a
figure
with
the
face
of
a
great
dane
general
daniel
nayland
the
military
commander
of
tonto
basin
the
inside
guards
jumped
to
attention
and
saluted
the
barrier
shot
up
as
though
and
the
car
slid
through
the
barrier
slammed
down
behind
it
on
the
other
side
the
guards
were
hurling
themselves
into
a
frenzy
of
saluting
karen
made
a
face
after
the
receding
car
and
muttered
something
in
hindustani
she
probably
did
know
the
literal
meaning
of
what
she
had
called
general
nayland
but
she
understood
that
it
was
a
term
of
extreme
opprobrium
her
husband
contributed
his
idea
of
heaven
would
be
a
huge
research
establishment
where
he
be
a
general
and
galileo
newton
priestley
dalton
maxwell
planck
and
einstein
would
be
tech
sergeants
and
marie
curie
and
lise
meitner
would
be
wac
corporals
karen
added
he
really
hates
all
of
us
does
he
he
hates
our
team
macleod
replied
in
the
first
place
we
a
lot
of
civilians
who
are
subject
to
his
regulations
and
do
have
to
salute
him
we
working
under
contract
with
the
western
union
not
with
the
united
states
government
and
as
the
united
states
participates
in
the
western
union
on
a
treaty
basis
our
contract
has
the
force
of
a
treaty
obligation
it
gives
us
what
amounts
to
extraterritoriality
like
europeans
in
china
during
the
nineteenth
century
so
we
have
our
own
transport
for
which
he
must
furnish
petrol
and
our
own
armed
guard
and
we
fly
our
own
flag
over
team
center
and
that
gripes
him
as
much
as
anything
else
that
and
the
fact
that
we
foreigners
so
would
he
love
to
make
this
espionage
rap
stick
on
us
and
our
contract
specifically
gives
the
united
states
the
right
to
take
action
against
us
in
case
we
endanger
the
national
security
karen
added
she
stuffed
her
cigarette
into
the
receiver
beside
her
chair
her
blue
eyes
troubled
you
know
some
of
us
could
get
shot
over
this
if
we
not
careful
dunc
does
it
really
have
to
be
one
of
our
own
people
who
i
do
see
how
it
could
be
anybody
else
macleod
said
i
do
like
the
idea
any
more
than
you
do
but
there
it
is
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
is
there
nobody
whom
we
can
trust
among
the
technicians
and
guards
yes
i
could
think
of
a
score
who
are
absolutely
loyal
but
among
the
team
itself
the
top
researchers
there
nobody
i
take
a
chance
on
but
kato
sugihara
can
you
even
be
sure
of
him
i
hate
to
think
of
him
as
a
traitor
but
i
have
a
couple
of
reasons
for
eliminating
kato
macleod
said
in
the
first
place
outside
nucleonic
and
physics
there
are
only
three
things
he
interested
in
jitterbugging
neckties
and
cooking
if
he
went
over
to
the
komintern
he
would
be
able
to
get
any
of
those
then
he
only
spends
about
half
his
share
of
the
team
profits
and
turns
the
rest
back
into
the
team
fund
he
has
a
credit
of
about
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
which
lose
by
leaving
us
and
then
there
another
thing
kato
father
was
killed
on
guadalcanal
in
when
he
was
only
five
after
that
he
was
brought
up
in
the
teachings
of
bushido
by
his
grandfather
an
samurai
bushido
is
open
to
some
criticism
but
nobody
can
show
where
your
own
gang
is
good
bushido
and
today
japan
is
allied
with
the
western
union
and
in
any
case
he
would
help
the
komintern
the
japs
forgive
russia
for
that
mussolini
in
after
the
irish
start
building
monuments
to
cromwell
a
jeep
lettered
research
in
was
approaching
across
the
wide
concrete
apron
macleod
grinned
here
it
comes
fasten
your
safety
belt
when
you
get
in
that
ahmed
driving
karen
looked
at
her
watch
and
it
almost
time
for
dinner
you
know
i
dread
the
thought
of
sitting
at
the
table
with
the
others
and
wondering
which
of
them
is
betraying
us
only
nine
of
us
instead
of
thirteen
and
still
one
is
a
judas
macleod
said
i
suppose
there
always
a
place
for
judas
at
any
table
the
macleod
team
dined
together
apart
from
their
assistants
and
technicians
and
students
this
was
no
snobbish
attempt
at
matters
of
team
policy
were
often
discussed
at
the
big
round
table
and
the
more
confidential
details
of
their
work
people
who
have
only
their
knowledge
and
their
ideas
to
sell
are
wary
about
bandying
either
loosely
and
the
six
men
and
three
women
who
faced
each
other
across
the
diameter
of
the
teakwood
table
had
no
other
they
were
nine
people
of
nine
different
nationalities
or
they
were
nine
people
of
the
common
of
science
that
duncan
macleod
their
leader
had
grown
up
in
the
transvaal
and
his
wife
had
been
born
in
the
swedish
university
town
of
upsala
was
typical
not
only
of
their
own
group
but
of
the
hundreds
of
independent
that
had
sprung
up
after
the
second
world
war
the
may
have
been
born
of
the
relentless
struggle
for
scientific
armament
supremacy
among
nations
and
the
competition
for
improved
techniques
among
industrial
corporations
during
the
late
and
early
but
he
had
been
begotten
when
two
masses
of
uranium
came
together
at
the
top
of
a
steel
tower
in
new
mexico
in
and
because
scientific
research
is
a
matter
of
pooling
brains
and
efforts
the
independent
scientists
had
banded
together
into
teams
whose
leaders
acquired
power
greater
than
that
of
any
captain
of
renaissance
italy
duncan
macleod
sitting
outwardly
relaxed
and
merry
and
secretly
watchful
and
bitterly
sad
was
such
a
of
science
one
by
one
the
others
had
rallied
around
him
not
because
he
was
a
greater
physicist
than
they
but
because
he
was
a
bolder
more
clever
less
scrupulous
adventurer
better
able
to
guide
them
through
the
maze
of
international
and
the
no
less
ruthless
if
less
nakedly
violent
world
of
big
industry
there
was
his
wife
karen
hilquist
the
young
metallurgist
who
before
she
was
had
perfected
a
new
hardening
process
for
skf
and
an
incredibly
tough
for
the
bofors
works
in
the
few
minutes
since
they
had
returned
to
team
center
she
had
managed
to
change
her
coveralls
for
a
skirt
and
blouse
and
do
something
intriguing
with
her
hair
and
there
was
kato
sugihara
looking
younger
than
his
years
who
had
begun
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
whole
orders
of
structure
below
the
level
of
nuclear
particles
there
was
suzanne
maillard
her
gray
hair
upswept
from
a
face
that
had
never
been
beautiful
but
which
was
alive
with
something
rarer
than
mere
beauty
she
possessed
at
the
brink
of
fifty
a
charm
and
smartness
that
many
women
half
her
age
might
have
envied
and
she
knew
more
about
cosmic
rays
than
any
other
person
living
and
adam
lowiewski
his
black
mustache
contrasting
so
oddly
with
his
silver
hair
frantically
scribbling
equations
on
his
as
though
his
racing
fingers
could
never
keep
pace
with
his
brain
and
explaining
them
with
obvious
condescension
to
the
japanese
beside
him
he
was
one
of
the
greatest
of
living
mathematicians
by
anybody
reckoning
greatest
by
his
own
and
sir
neville
lawton
the
electronics
expert
with
thinning
hair
and
mustache
who
always
gave
the
impression
of
being
in
evening
clothes
even
when
as
now
he
was
dressed
in
faded
khaki
and
heym
the
israeli
quantum
and
man
his
heaping
dinner
plate
an
affront
to
the
laws
of

his
white
hair
a
fluffy
tangled
chaos
laughing
at
an
joke
the
english
knight
had
made
and
rudolf
von
heldenfeld
with
a
killer
mouth
and
a
frozen
face
that
never
betrayed
its
owner
thoughts
he
was
the
specialist
in
magnetic
currents
and
electromagnetic
fields
and
farida
khouroglu
the
turkish
girl
whom
macleod
and
karen
had
found
begging
in
the
streets
of
istanbul
ten
years
ago
and
who
had
grown
up
following
the
fortunes
of
the
macleod
team
on
every
continent
and
in
a
score
of
nations
it
was
doubtful
if
she
had
ever
had
a
day
formal
schooling
in
her
life
but
now
she
was
secretary
of
the
team
with
a
grasp
of
physics
that
would
have
shamed
many
a
professor
she
had
grown
up
a
beauty
too
with
the
large
dark
eyes
and
hair
and
skin
of
her
race
she
and
kato
sugihara
were
very
much
in
love
a
good
team
the
best
team
in
a
world
macleod
thought
toying
with
the
stem
of
his
wineglass
of
some
of
their
triumphs
the
west
australia
atomic
power
plant
the
segovia
plutonium
works
which
had
got
them
all
titled
as
grandees
of
the
restored
spanish
monarchy
the
chemical
extraction
plant
in
puerto
rico
where
they
had
worked
for
associated
enterprises
whose
president
blake
hartley
had
later
become
president
of
the
united
states
the
victory
over
a
seemingly
insoluble
problem
in
the
belgian
congo
uranium
mines
he
thought
too
of
the
dangers
they
had
faced
together
in
a
world
where
soldiers
must
use
the
weapons
of
science
and
scientists
must
learn
the
arts
of
violence
of
the
treachery
of
the
islamic
kaliphate
for
whom
they
had
once
worked
of
the
intrigues
and
plots
which
had
surrounded
them
in
spain
of
the
many
attempted
kidnappings
and
assassinations
of
the
time
in
basra
when
they
had
fought
with
pistols
and
tommy
guns
and
clubs
and
flasks
of
acid
to
defend
their
laboratories
a
good
team
before
the
rot
of
treason
had
touched
it
he
could
almost
smell
the
putrid
stench
of
it
and
yet
as
he
glanced
from
face
to
face
he
could
not
guess
the
traitor
and
he
had
so
little
time
kato
sugihara
voice
rose
to
dominate
the
murmur
of
conversation
around
the
table
i
think
i
am
getting
somewhere
on
my
he
announced
and
i
think
it
can
be
correlated
to
the
research
so
von
heldenfeld
looked
up
in
interest
and
not
with
the
problem
of
what
goes
on
in
the
layer
surrounding
the
earth
no
suzanne
talked
me
out
of
that
idea
the
japanese
replied
just
a
secondary
effect
of
the
effect
of
cosmic
rays
and
solar
radiations
on
the
order
of
particles
existing
at
that
level
but
i
think
that
i
have
the
key
to
the
problem
of
collapsing
matter
to
plate
the
hull
of
the
spaceship
that
interesting
sir
neville
lawton
commented
how
so
well
you
know
what
happens
when
a
photon
comes
in
contact
with
the
atomic
structure
of
matter
kato
said
there
may
be
an
elastic
collision
in
which
the
photon
merely
bounces
off
macroscopically
that
the
effect
we
call
reflection
of
light
or
there
may
be
an
inelastic
collision
when
the
photon
hits
an
atom
and
knocks
out
an
electron
the
old
photoelectric
effect
or
the
photon
may
be
retained
for
a
while
and
emitted
again
relatively
unchanged
the
effect
observed
in
luminous
paint
or
the
photon
may
penetrate
undergo
a
change
to
a
neutrino
and
either
remain
in
the
nucleus
of
the
atom
or
pass
through
it
depending
upon
a
number
of
factors
all
this
of
course
is
old
stuff
even
the
interchange
has
been
known
since
the
when
the
gamow
was
developed
but
now
we
come
to
what
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
christen
the
sugihara
effect
the
neutrino
picking
up
a
negative
charge
and
in
effect
turning
into
an
electron
and
then
losing
its
charge
turning
back
into
a
neutrino
and
then
as
in
the
case
of
metal
heated
to
incandescence
being
emitted
again
as
a
photon
at
first
we
thought
this
had
no
connection
with
the
spaceship
insulation
problem
we
are
under
contract
to
work
out
and
we
agreed
to
keep
this
effect
a
team
secret
until
we
could
find
out
if
it
had
commercial
possibilities
but
now
i
find
that
it
has
a
direct
connection
with
the
problem
when
the
electron
loses
its
negative
charge
and
reverts
to
a
neutrino
there
is
a
definite
accretion
of
interatomic
and
the
molecule
or
the
crystalline
lattice
or
whatever
tends
to
contract
and
when
the
neutrino
becomes
a
photon
the
nucleus
of
the
atom
contracts
heym
was
sitting
oblivious
to
everything
but
his
young
colleague
words
a
slice
of
the
flesh
of
the
unclean
beast
impaled
on
his
fork
and
halfway
to
his
mouth
yes
certainly
he
exclaimed
that
would
explain
so
many
things
i
have
wondered
about
and
of
course
there
are
other
forces
at
work
which
in
the
course
of
nature
balance
that
effect
but
can
the
process
be
controlled
suzanne
maillard
wanted
to
know
can
you
convert
electrons
to
neutrinos
and
then
to
photons
in
sufficient
numbers
and
eliminate
other
effects
that
would
cause
compensating
atomic
and
molecular
expansion
kato
grinned
like
a
tomcat
contemplating
the
bones
of
a
fish
he
has
just
eaten
yes
i
can
i
have
he
turned
to
macleod
remember
those
bullets
i
got
from
you
he
asked
macleod
nodded
he
handloaded
for
his
and
like
all
advanced
cases
of
he
was
religiously
fanatical
about
uniformity
of
bullet
weights
and
dimensions
unlike
most
handloaders
he
had
available
the
instruments
to
secure
such
uniformity
those
bullets
are
as
nearly
alike
as
different
objects
can
be
kato
said
they
weigh
grains
and
that
means
the
diameter
is
inches
all
right
i
been
subjecting
those
bullets
to
different
and
the
best
results
have
given
me
a
bullet
with
a
diameter
of
inches
and
the
weight
is
unchanged
in
other
words
there
been
no
loss
of
mass
but
the
mass
had
contracted
and
that
only
been
the
first
test
well
write
up
everything
you
have
on
it
and
we
lay
out
further
experimental
work
macleod
said
he
glanced
around
the
table
so
far
we
ca
be
entirely
sure
the
shrinkage
may
be
all
in
the
crystalline
lattice
the
atomic
structure
may
be
unchanged
what
we
need
is
matter
that
is
really
collapsed
i
do
that
kato
said
barida
i
have
all
my
data
available
for
you
before
noon
tomorrow
you
can
make
up
copies
for
all
team
members
make
mine
on
microfilm
for
projection
von
heldenfeld
said
mine
too
sir
neville
lawton
added
better
make
microfilm
copies
for
everybody
heym
suggested
they
handier
than
macleod
rose
silently
and
tiptoed
around
behind
his
wife
and
rudolf
von
heldenfeld
to
touch
kato
sugihara
on
the
shoulder
come
on
outside
kato
he
whispered
i
want
to
talk
to
you
the
japanese
nodded
and
rose
following
him
outside
onto
the
roof
above
the
laboratories
they
walked
over
to
the
edge
and
stopped
at
the
balustrade
kato
when
you
write
up
your
stuff
i
want
you
to
falsify
everything
you
can
put
it
in
such
form
that
the
data
will
be
absolutely
worthless
but
also
in
such
form
that
nobody
not
even
team
members
will
know
it
has
been
falsified
can
you
do
that
kato
eyes
widened
of
course
i
can
dunc
he
replied
but
why
i
hate
to
say
this
but
we
have
a
traitor
in
the
team
one
of
those
people
back
in
the
dining
room
is
selling
us
out
to
the
fourth
komintern
i
know
it
not
karen
and
i
know
it
not
you
and
that
as
much
as
i
do
know
now
the
japanese
sucked
in
his
breath
in
a
sharp
hiss
you
would
say
that
unless
you
were
sure
dunc
he
said
no
at
about
this
morning
weissberg
the
civilian
director
called
me
to
his
office
i
found
him
very
much
upset
he
told
me
that
general
nayland
is
accusing
us
by
which
he
meant
this
team
of
furnishing
secret
information
on
our
subproject
to
komintern
agents
he
said
that
british
intelligence
agents
at
smolensk
had
learned
that
the
red
triumph
laboratories
there
were
working
along
lines
of
research
originated
at
macleod
team
center
here
they
relayed
the
information
to
western
union
central
intelligence
and
wu
passed
it
on
to
united
states
central
intelligence
and
now
counter
espionage
is
riding
nayland
about
it
and
he
trying
to
make
us
the
goat
he
would
love
to
get
some
of
us
shot
kato
said
and
that
could
happen
they
took
a
long
time
getting
tough
about
espionage
in
this
country
but
when
americans
get
tough
about
something
they
get
tough
right
but
look
here
we
handed
in
our
to
felix
weissberg
and
he
passed
them
on
to
nayland
could
the
leak
be
right
in
nayland
own
hq
that
what
i
thought
at
first
macleod
replied
just
wishful
thinking
though
fact
is
i
went
up
to
nayland
hq
and
had
it
out
with
him
accused
him
of
just
that
i
think
i
threw
enough
of
a
scare
into
him
to
hold
him
for
a
couple
of
days
i
wanted
to
know
just
what
it
was
the
komintern
was
supposed
to
have
got
from
us
but
he
would
tell
me
that
of
course
was
well
well
then
karen
and
i
got
our
digestive
tracts
emptied
and
went
in
to
town
where
i
could
use
a
phone
that
did
go
through
a
military
and
i
put
through
a
call
to
allan
hartley
president
hartley
son
he
owes
us
a
break
after
the
work
we
did
in
puerto
rico
i
told
him
all
i
wanted
was
some
information
to
help
clear
ourselves
and
he
told
me
to
wait
a
half
an
hour
and
then
call
counter
espionage
office
in
washington
and
talk
to
general
hammond
ha
if
allan
hartley
for
us
what
are
we
worried
about
kato
asked
i
always
knew
he
was
the
power
back
of
associated
enterprises
and
his
father
was
the
i
bet
it
the
same
with
the
government
allan
hartley
for
us
as
long
as
our
nose
is
clean
if
we
let
it
get
dirty
we
get
it
bloodied
too
we
have
to
clean
it
ourselves
macleod
told
him
but
here
what
hammond
gave
me
the
komintern
knows
all
about
our
experiments
with
zinc
titanium
and
nickel
they
know
about
our
theoretical
work
on
cosmic
rays
including
work
up
to
about
a
month
ago
they
know
about
that
effect
sir
neville
and
heym
discovered
two
months
ago
he
paused
and
they
know
about
the
interchange
kato
responded
to
this
with
a
gruesome
that
gave
his
face
the
fleeting
appearance
of
an
ancient
samurai
war
mask
that
was
included
in
any
report
we
ever
made
he
said
right
the
leak
comes
from
inside
the
team
it
must
be
sir
neville
or
suzanne
or
heym
or
adam
lowiewski
or
rudolf
von
heldenfeld
or
no
no
i
ca
believe
it
could
be
farida
he
looked
at
macleod
pleadingly
you
do
think
she
could
have
no
kato
the
team
her
whole
life
even
more
than
it
is
mine
she
came
with
us
when
she
was
only
twelve
and
grew
up
with
us
she
know
any
other
life
than
this
and
would
want
any
other
it
has
to
be
one
of
the
other
five
well
there
suzanne
kato
began
she
had
to
clear
out
of
france
because
of
political
activities
after
the
collapse
of
the
fourth
republic
and
the
establishment
of
the
rightist
directoire
in
and
she
worked
with
and
she
was
at
the
university
of
louvain
in
the
early
when
that
place
was
crawling
with
commies
and
that
brings
us
to
sir
neville
macleod
added
he
dabbles
in
spiritualism
he
and
suzanne
do
a
planchette
can
be
manipulated
maybe
suzanne
produced
a
communication
advising
sir
neville
to
help
the
komintern
could
be
then
how
about
lowiewski
he
a
pole
who
ca
go
back
to
poland
and
poland
a
komintern
country
kato
pointed
out
maybe
sell
us
out
for
amnesty
though
why
he
want
to
go
back
there
the
way
things
are
now
his
vanity
you
know
native
going
back
to
the
village
wearing
real
pants
to
show
off
to
the
savages
used
to
be
a
standing
joke
down
where
i
came
from
macleod
thought
for
a
moment
and
rudolf
he
always
had
a
poor
view
of
the
democratic
system
of
government
he
might
feel
more
at
home
with
the
komintern
of
course
the
ruskis
killed
his
parents
in
so
what
kato
retorted
the
americans
killed
my
father
in
but
i
not
making
an
issue
out
of
it
that
was
another
war
japan
a
western
union
country
now
so
germany
how
about
heym
by
the
way
remember
when
the
komintern
wanted
us
to
come
to
russia
and
do
the
same
work
we
doing
here
i
remember
that
after
we
turned
them
down
somebody
tried
to
kidnap
karen
macleod
said
grimly
i
remember
a
couple
of
russians
got
rather
suddenly
dead
trying
it
too
i
was
thinking
of
that
i
was
thinking
of
our
argument
when
the
proposition
was
considered
heym
was
in
favor
of
accepting
now
that
i
would
say
indicates
either
communist
sympathies
or
an
overtrusting
nature
kato
submitted
and
a
lot
of
traitors
have
been
made
out
of
people
with
trusting
natures
macleod
got
out
his
pipe
and
lit
it
for
a
long
time
he
stared
out
across
the
vista
of
sagebrush
dotted
at
wide
intervals
with
the
bulks
of
and
the
red
roofs
of
the
villages
kato
i
think
i
know
how
we
going
to
find
out
which
one
it
is
he
said
first
of
all
you
write
up
your
data
and
falsify
it
so
that
it
wo
do
any
damage
if
it
gets
into
komintern
hands
and
then
the
next
day
started
in
an
atmosphere
of
suppressed
excitement
and
anxiety
which
beginning
with
macleod
and
karen
and
kato
sugihara
seemed
to
communicate
itself
by
contagion
to
everybody
in
the
macleod
team
laboratories
the
top
researchers
and
their
immediate
assistants
and
students
were
the
first
to
catch
it
they
ascribed
the
tension
under
which
their
leader
and
his
wife
and
the
japanese
labored
to
the
recent
developments
in
the
problem
then
there
were
about
a
dozen
technicians
and
guards
who
had
been
secretly
gathered
in
macleod
office
the
night
before
and
informed
of
the
crisis
that
had
arisen
their
associates
could
not
miss
the
fact
that
they
were
preoccupied
with
something
unusual
they
were
a
variegated
crew
men
who
had
been
added
to
the
team
in
every
corner
of
the
world
there
was
ahmed
the
arab
who
had
joined
them
in
basra
there
was
the
wiry
little
greek
whom
everybody
called
alex
unpronounceable
there
was
an
italian
and
two
chinese
and
a
cashiered
french
air
force
officer
and
a
malay
and
the
son
of
an
english
earl
who
insisted
that
his
name
was
bertie
wooster
they
had
sworn
themselves
to
secrecy
had
heard
macleod
story
with
a
polylingual
burst
of
pious
or
blasphemous
exclamations
and
then
they
had
scattered
each
to
the
work
assigned
him
macleod
had
risen
early
and
submitted
to
the
ordeal
of
the
search
to
leave
the
reservation
and
go
to
town
again
this
time
for
a
conference
at
the
shabby
cigar
store
that
concealed
a
counter
espionage
center
he
had
returned
just
as
farida
khouroglu
was
finishing
the
microfilm
copies
of
kato
these
copies
were
distributed
at
noon
while
the
team
was
lunching
along
with
carbons
of
the
original
he
was
the
first
to
leave
the
table
going
directly
to
the
basement
where
alex
unpronounceable
and
the
man
who
had
got
his
alias
from
the
works
of
wodehouse
were
listening
in
on
the
telephone
calls
going
in
and
out
through
the
and
making
recordings
for
two
hours
macleod
remained
with
them
he
heard
suzanne
maillard
and
some
woman
who
was
talking
from
a
number
in
the
army
settlement
making
arrangements
about
a
party
he
heard
rudolf
von
heldenfeld
make
a
date
with
some
girl
he
listened
to
a
violent
altercation
between
the
team
chef
and
somebody
at
army
hq
about
the
quality
of
a
lot
of
dressed
chicken
he
listened
to
a
call
that
came
in
for
adam
lowiewski
the
mathematician
this
is
joe
the
caller
said
i
got
to
go
to
town
late
this
afternoon
but
i
was
wondering
if
you
have
time
to
meet
me
at
the
recreation
house
at
oppenheimer
village
for
a
game
of
chess
i
calling
from
there
now
fine
i
can
make
it
lowiewski
voice
replied
i
in
the
middle
of
a
devil
own
mathematical
problem
maybe
a
game
of
chess
would
clear
my
head
i
have
a
new
gambit
i
want
to
try
on
you
anyhow
bertie
wooster
looked
up
sharply
now
there
that
may
be
what
we
the
telephone
beside
macleod
rang
he
scooped
it
up
named
himself
into
it
it
was
ahmed
look
chief
i
tail
this
guy
to
oppenheimer
village
the
arab
who
had
learned
english
from
american
movies
answered
he
goes
into
the
i
slide
in
after
him
an
he
ai
in
sight
i
lookin
around
for
him
see
when
he
comes
outa
the
don
ameche
box
then
he
grabs
a
table
an
a
beer
what
next
stay
there
keep
an
eye
on
him
macleod
told
him
if
i
want
you
call
macleod
hung
up
and
straightened
feeling
under
his
packet
for
his
that
it
boys
he
said
lowiewski
come
on
hah
alex
unpronounceable
had
his
gun
out
and
was
checking
the
cylinder
he
spoke
briefly
in
description
of
the
polish
ancestry
physical
characteristics
and
probable
destination
then
he
put
the
gun
away
and
the
three
men
left
the
basement
for
minutes
that
seamed
like
hours
macleod
and
the
greek
waited
on
the
main
floor
where
they
could
watch
both
the
elevators
and
the
stairway
bertie
wooster
had
gone
up
to
alert
kato
sugihara
and
karen
then
the
door
of
one
of
the
elevators
opened
and
adam
lowiewski
emerged
with
kato
behind
him
apparently
lost
in
a
bulky
scientific
journal
he
was
reading
the
greek
moved
in
from
one
side
and
macleod
stepped
in
front
of
the
pole
hi
adam
he
greeted
have
you
looked
into
that
batch
of
data
yet
oh
yes
yes
lowiewski
seemed
barely
able
to
keep
his
impatience
within
the
bounds
of
politeness
of
course
it
out
of
my
line
but
the
mathematics
seems
sound
he
started
to
move
away
you
not
going
anywhere
macleod
told
him
the
chess
game
is
over
the
red
pawns
are
taken
the
one
at
oppenheimer
village
and
the
one
here
there
was
a
split
second
in
which
lowiewski
struggled
almost
successfully
to
erase
the
consternation
from
his
face
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
he
began
his
right
hand
started
to
slide
under
his
left
coat
lapel
macleod
colt
was
covering
him
before
he
could
complete
the
movement
at
the
same
time
kato
sugihara
dropped
the
periodical
revealing
the
knife
he
had
concealed
under
it
he
stepped
forward
pressing
the
point
of
the
weapon
against
the
pole
side
with
the
other
hand
he
reached
across
lowiewski
chest
and
jerked
the
pistol
from
his
it
was
one
of
the
elegant
little
beretta
model
automatics
into
the
elevator
macleod
ordered
an
increasing
pressure
of
knife
emphasized
the
order
and
watch
him
do
let
him
get
rid
of
anything
he
added
to
the
greek
if
you
would
explain
this
outrage
lowiewski
began
i
assume
it
is
your
idea
of
a
joke
without
even
replying
macleod
slammed
the
doors
and
started
the
elevator
upward
letting
it
rise
six
floors
to
the
living
quarters
karen
hilquist
and
the
aristocratic
who
called
himself
bertie
wooster
were
waiting
when
he
opened
the
door
the
englishman
took
one
of
lowiewski
arms
macleod
took
the
other
the
rest
fell
in
behind
as
they
hustled
the
captive
down
the
hall
and
into
the
big
dining
room
they
kept
lowiewski
standing
well
away
from
any
movable
object
in
the
room
alex
unpronounceable
took
his
left
arm
as
macleod
released
it
and
went
to
the
communicator
and
punched
the
button
maillard
sir
neville
lawton
von
heldenfeld
mlle
khouroglu
he
called
macleod
speaking
come
at
once
repeat
at
once
to
the
round
table
maillard
sir
neville
lawton
karen
said
something
to
the
japanese
and
went
outside
for
a
while
nobody
spoke
kato
came
over
and
lit
a
cigarette
in
the
bowl
of
macleod
pipe
then
the
other
team
members
entered
in
a
body
evidently
karen
had
intercepted
them
in
the
hallway
and
warned
them
that
they
would
find
some
unusual
situation
inside
even
so
there
was
a
burst
of
surprised
exclamations
when
they
found
adam
lowiewski
under
detention
ladies
and
gentlemen
macleod
said
i
regret
to
tell
you
that
i
have
placed
our
colleague
lowiewski
under
arrest
he
is
suspected
of
betraying
confidential
data
to
agents
of
the
fourth
komintern
yesterday
i
learned
that
data
on
all
our
work
here
including
data
on
the
sugihara
effect
had
got
into
the
hands
of
the
komintern
and
was
being
used
in
research
at
the
smolensk
laboratories
i
also
learned
that
general
nayland
blames
this
team
as
a
whole
with
and
selling
this
data
to
the
komintern
i
do
need
to
go
into
any
lengthy
exposition
of
general
nayland
attitude
toward
this
team
or
toward
free
scientists
as
a
class
or
toward
the
system
nor
do
i
need
to
point
out
that
if
he
pressed
these
charges
against
us
some
of
us
could
easily
suffer
death
or
imprisonment
so
he
had
to
have
a
victim
in
a
hurry
and
pulled
my
name
out
of
the
hat
lowiewski
sneered
i
appreciate
the
gravity
of
the
situation
sir
neville
lawton
said
and
if
the
sugihara
effect
was
among
the
data
betrayed
i
can
understand
that
nobody
but
one
of
us
could
have
betrayed
it
but
why
necessarily
should
it
be
adam
we
all
have
unlimited
access
to
all
records
and
theoretical
data
exactly
but
collecting
information
is
the
smallest
and
easiest
part
of
espionage
almost
anybody
can
collect
information
where
the
spy
really
earns
his
pay
is
in
transmitting
of
information
now
think
of
the
almost
fantastic
security
measures
in
force
here
and
consider
how
you
would
get
such
information
including
masses
of
mathematical
data
beyond
any
human
power
of
memorization
out
of
this
reservation
ha
nobody
can
take
anything
out
suzanne
maillard
said
not
even
one
breakfast
is
adam
accused
of
sorcery
too
the
only
material
things
that
are
allowed
to
leave
this
reservation
are
sealed
cases
of
models
and
data
shipped
to
the
different
development
plants
and
the
sugihara
effect
never
was
reported
and
would
go
out
that
way
heym
objected
but
the
data
on
the
sugihara
effect
reached
smolensk
macleod
replied
and
do
talk
about
darwin
and
wallace
it
was
a
coincidence
this
stuff
was
taken
out
of
the
tonto
basin
reservation
by
the
only
person
who
could
have
done
so
in
the
only
way
that
anything
could
leave
the
reservation
without
search
so
i
had
that
person
shadowed
and
at
the
same
time
i
had
our
telephone
lines
tapped
and
eavesdropped
on
all
calls
entering
or
leaving
this
center
and
the
person
who
had
to
be
the
called
adam
lowiewski
and
lowiewski
made
an
appointment
to
meet
him
at
the
oppenheimer
village
recreation
house
to
play
chess
very
suspicious
very
suspicious
lowiewski
derided
i
receive
a
call
from
a
friend
at
the
same
time
that
some
anonymous
suspect
is
using
the
phone
there
are
only
five
hundred
telephone
conversations
a
minute
on
this
reservation
immediately
lowiewski
attempted
to
leave
this
building
macleod
went
on
when
i
intercepted
him
he
tried
to
draw
a
pistol
this
one
he
exhibited
the
beretta
i
am
now
going
to
have
lowiewski
searched
in
the
presence
of
all
of
you
he
nodded
to
alex
and
the
englishman
they
did
their
work
thoroughly
a
pile
of
lowiewski
pocket
effects
was
made
on
the
table
as
each
item
was
added
to
it
the
pole
made
some
sarcastic
comment
and
that
pack
of
cigarettes
unopened
he
jeered
i
suppose
i
communicated
the
data
to
the
manufacturers
by
telepathy
and
they
printed
it
on
the
cigarette
papers
in
invisible
ink
maybe
not
maybe
you
opened
the
pack
and
then
resealed
it
kato
suggested
a
heated
spatula
under
the
cellophane
like
this
he
used
the
point
of
his
knife
to
illustrate
the
cellophane
came
unsealed
with
surprising
ease
so
did
the
revenue
stamp
he
dumped
out
the
contents
of
the
pack
sixteen
cigarettes
four
cigarette
four
bits
snapped
from
the
other
ends
and
a
small
aluminum
microfilm
capsule
lowiewski
face
twitched
for
an
instant
he
tried
vainly
to
break
loose
from
the
men
who
held
him
then
he
slumped
into
a
chair
heym
gasped
in
shocked
surprise
suzanne
maillard
gave
a
short
felinelike
cry
sir
neville
lawton
looked
at
the
capsule
curiously
and
said
well
my
sainted
aunt
agatha
that
the
capsule
i
gave
him
at
noon
farida
khouroglu
exclaimed
picking
it
up
she
opened
it
and
pulled
out
a
roll
of
colloidex
projection
film
there
was
also
a
bit
of
cigarette
paper
in
the
capsule
upon
which
a
notation
had
been
made
in
kyrilic
characters
rudolf
von
heldenfeld
could
read
russian
on
new
development
of
interchange
july
vladmir
vladmir
i
suppose
is
this
code
name
he
added
the
film
and
the
paper
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
other
members
of
the
team
sat
down
there
was
a
tendency
to
move
away
from
the
chair
occupied
by
adam
lowiewski
he
noticed
this
and
sneered
afraid
of
contamination
from
the
moral
leper
he
asked
you
were
glad
enough
to
have
me
correct
your
stupid
mathematical
errors
kato
sugihara
picked
up
the
capsule
took
a
final
glance
at
the
cigarette
pack
and
said
to
macleod
i
be
back
as
soon
as
this
is
done
with
that
he
left
the
room
followed
by
bertie
wooster
and
the
greek
heym
turned
to
the
others
his
eyes
had
the
hurt
and
puzzled
look
of
a
dog
that
has
been
kicked
for
no
reason
but
why
did
he
do
this
he
asked
he
just
told
you
macleod
replied
he
the
great
adam
lowiewski
checking
math
for
a
team
is
beneath
his
dignity
i
suppose
the
komintern
offered
him
a
professorship
at
stalin
university
he
was
watching
lowiewski
face
keenly
no
he
continued
it
was
probably
the
mathematics
chair
of
the
soviet
academy
of
sciences
but
who
was
this
person
who
could
smuggle
microfilm
out
of
the
reservation
suzanne
maillard
wanted
to
know
somebody
has
invented
teleportation
then
macleod
shook
his
head
it
was
general
nayland
chauffeur
it
had
to
be
general
nayland
car
is
the
only
thing
that
gets
out
of
here
without
being
searched
the
car
itself
is
serviced
at
army
vehicles
pool
nobody
could
hide
anything
in
it
for
a
confederate
to
pick
up
outside
nayland
is
a
stuffed
shirt
of
the
first
stuffing
and
a
tinpot
hitler
to
boot
but
he
is
fanatically
and
incorruptibly
patriotic
that
leaves
the
chauffeur
when
nayland
in
the
car
nobody
even
sees
him
he
might
as
well
be
a
robot
old
case
of
father
invisible
man
so
since
he
had
to
be
the
courier
all
i
did
was
have
ahmed
shadow
him
and
at
the
same
time
tap
our
phones
when
he
contacted
lowiewski
i
knew
lowiewski
was
our
traitor
sir
neville
lawton
gave
a
strangling
laugh
oh
my
dear
aunt
fanny
and
nayland
goes
positively
crackers
on
security
he
gets
goose
pimples
every
time
he
hears
somebody
saying
for
fear
a
komintern
spy
might
hear
him
it
a
wonder
he
has
put
the
value
of
constant
on
the
classified
list
he
sets
up
all
these
fantastic
search
rooms
and
barriers
and
then
he
drives
through
the
gate
honking
his
bloody
horn
with
his
chauffeur
pockets
full
of
top
secrets
now
seen
everything
not
quite
everything
macleod
said
kato
going
to
put
that
capsule
in
another
cigarette
pack
and
he
send
one
of
his
lab
girls
to
oppenheimer
village
with
it
with
a
message
from
lowiewski
to
the
effect
that
he
could
get
away
and
when
this
chauffeur
takes
it
out
run
into
a
counter
espionage
on
the
way
to
town
shoot
him
of
course
and
they
probably
transfer
nayland
to
the
mississippi
valley
flood
control
project
where
he
ca
do
any
more
damage
at
least
we
have
him
out
of
our
hair
if
we
have
any
hair
left
heym
gloomed
you
got
nayland
into
trouble
but
you
have
got
us
out
of
it
what
do
you
mean
suzanne
maillard
demanded
he
found
the
traitor
and
stopped
the
leak
yes
but
we
still
responsible
as
a
team
for
this
betrayal
the
israeli
pointed
out
this
nayland
is
only
a
symptom
of
the
enmity
which
politicians
and
militarists
feel
toward
the
free
scientists
and
of
their
opposition
to
the
system
now
they
have
a
scandal
to
use
our
part
in
stopping
the
leak
will
be
ignored
the
publicity
will
be
about
the
treason
of
a
free
scientist
that
right
sir
neville
lawton
agreed
and
that
brings
up
another
point
we
simply
ca
hand
this
fellow
over
to
the
authorities
if
we
do
we
establish
a
precedent
that
may
wreck
the
whole
system
under
which
we
operate
yes
it
would
be
a
fine
thing
if
governments
start
putting
free
scientists
on
trial
and
shooting
them
farida
khouroglu
supported
him
in
a
few
years
none
of
us
would
be
safe
but
suzanne
cried
you
are
not
arguing
that
this
species
of
an
animal
be
allowed
to
betray
us
unpunished
look
rudolf
von
heldenfeld
said
let
us
give
him
his
pistol
and
one
cartridge
and
let
him
remove
himself
like
a
gentleman
he
will
spare
himself
the
humiliation
of
trial
and
execution
and
us
all
the
embarrassment
of
having
a
fellow
scientist
pilloried
as
a
traitor
now
there
a
typical
prussian
suggestion
lowiewski
said
kato
sugihara
returning
alone
looked
around
the
table
did
i
miss
something
interesting
he
asked
oh
very
lowiewski
told
him
your
junker
friend
thinks
i
should
perform
kato
nodded
quickly
excellent
idea
he
congratulated
von
heldenfeld
if
he
does
he
save
everybody
a
lot
of
trouble
himself
included
he
nodded
again
if
he
does
that
we
can
protect
his
reputation
after
he
dead
i
do
really
see
how
sir
neville
objected
when
the
counter
espionage
people
were
brought
into
this
the
thing
went
out
of
our
control
why
this
chauffeur
was
the
spy
as
well
as
the
macleod
said
the
information
he
transmitted
was
picked
up
piecemeal
from
different
indiscreet
and
students
attached
to
our
team
of
course
we
are
investigating
naturally
no
one
will
admit
no
stone
will
be
left
unturned
disciplinary
action
and
i
suppose
he
got
that
microfilm
piecemeal
too
lowiewski
asked
oh
that
macleod
shrugged
that
was
planted
on
him
one
of
our
girls
arranged
an
opportunity
for
him
to
steal
it
from
her
after
we
began
to
suspect
him
of
course
kato
falsified
everything
he
put
into
that
report
as
information
it
worthless
worthless
it
better
than
that
kato
grinned
i
really
sorry
the
komintern
wo
get
it
they
try
some
of
that
stuff
out
with
the
big
betatron
at
smolensk
and
a
microsecond
after
they
throw
the
switch
smolensk
would
look
worse
than
hiroshima
did
well
why
would
our
esteemed
colleague
commit
suicide
just
at
this
time
karen
hilquist
asked
maybe
plutonium
poisoning
farida
suggested
he
was
doing
something
in
the
and
got
some
pu
in
him
and
of
course
not
as
painful
as
that
so
oh
my
dear
suzanne
protested
that
but
stinks
the
great
adam
lowiewski
descending
from
his
pinnacle
of
pure
mathematics
to
perform
a
vulgar
experiment
with
actual
the
frenchwoman
gave
an
exaggerated
shudder
horrors
besides
if
our
people
began
getting
radioactive
somebody
would
be
sure
to
claim
we
were
endangering
the
safely
of
the
whole
establishment
and
the
clause
would
be
invoked
and
some
nosy
person
would
put
a
geiger
on
the
dear
departed
sir
neville
added
nervous
collapse
karen
said
according
to
the
laity
all
scientists
are
crazy
crazy
people
kill
themselves
adam
lowiewski
was
a
scientist
ergo
adam
lowiewski
killed
himself
besides
a
nervous
collapse
instrumentally
detectable
heym
looked
at
macleod
his
eyes
troubled
but
dunc
have
we
the
right
to
put
him
to
death
either
by
his
own
hand
or
by
an
army
firing
squad
he
asked
remember
he
is
not
only
a
traitor
he
is
one
of
the
world
greatest
mathematical
minds
have
we
a
right
to
destroy
that
mind
von
heldenfeld
shouted
banging
his
fist
on
the
table
i
do
care
if
he
gauss
and
riemann
and
lorenz
and
poincare
and
minkowski
and
whitehead
and
einstein
all
collapsed
into
one
the
man
is
a
stinking
traitor
not
only
to
us
but
to
all
scientists
and
all
sciences
if
he
does
shoot
himself
hand
him
over
to
the
united
states
and
let
them
shoot
him
why
do
we
go
on
arguing
lowiewski
was
smiling
now
the
panic
that
had
seized
him
in
the
hallway
below
and
the
desperation
when
the
cigarette
pack
had
been
opened
had
left
him
now
i
have
a
modest
proposal
which
will
solve
your
difficulties
he
said
i
have
money
papers
clothing
everything
i
will
need
outside
the
reservation
suppose
you
just
let
me
leave
here
then
if
there
is
any
trouble
you
can
use
this
fiction
about
the
indiscreet
underlings
without
the
unnecessary
embellishment
of
my
suicide
rudolf
von
heldenfeld
let
out
an
inarticulate
roar
of
fury
for
an
instant
he
was
beyond
words
then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
look
at
him
he
cried
look
at
him
laughing
in
our
faces
for
the
dupes
and
fools
he
thinks
we
are
he
thrust
out
his
hand
toward
macleod
give
me
the
pistol
he
wo
shoot
himself
i
do
it
for
him
it
would
work
dunc
really
it
would
heym
urged
no
karen
hilquist
contradicted
if
he
left
here
everybody
would
know
what
had
happened
and
we
be
accused
of
protecting
him
if
he
kills
himself
we
can
get
things
hushed
up
dead
traitors
are
good
traitors
but
if
he
remains
alive
we
must
disassociate
ourselves
from
him
by
handing
him
over
and
wreck
the
prestige
of
the
team
lowiewski
asked
at
least
you
will
not
live
to
see
that
suzanne
retorted
heym
put
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
his
head
in
his
hands
is
there
no
solution
to
this
he
almost
wailed
certainly
an
obvious
solution
macleod
said
rising
rudolf
has
just
stated
it
only
i
leader
of
this
team
and
there
are
of
course
jobs
a
simply
does
delegate
the
safety
catch
of
the
beretta
clicked
a
period
to
his
words
no
the
word
was
wrenched
almost
physically
out
of
lowiewski
he
too
was
on
his
feet
a
sudden
desperate
fear
in
his
face
no
you
murder
me
the
term
is
macleod
corrected
then
his
arm
swung
up
and
he
shot
adam
lowiewski
through
the
forehead
for
an
instant
the
pole
remained
on
his
feet
then
his
knees
buckled
and
he
fell
forward
against
the
table
sliding
to
the
floor
macleod
went
around
the
table
behind
kato
sugihara
and
farida
khouroglu
and
heym
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
man
he
had
killed
he
dropped
the
automatic
within
a
few
inches
of
the
dead
outstretched
hand
then
turned
to
face
the
others
i
regret
he
addressed
them
his
voice
and
face
blank
of
expression
to
announce
that
our
distinguished
colleague
adam
lowiewski
has
committed
suicide
by
shooting
after
a
nervous
collapse
resulting
from
overwork
sir
neville
lawton
looked
critically
at
the
motionless
figure
on
the
floor
i
afraid
we
have
trouble
making
that
stick
dunc
he
said
you
shot
him
at
about
five
yards
there
is
a
powder
mark
on
him
oh
sorry
i
forgot
macleod
voice
was
mockingly
contrite
it
was
lowiewski
expressed
wish
that
his
remains
be
cremated
as
soon
after
death
as
possible
and
that
funeral
services
be
held
over
his
ashes
the
big
electric
furnace
in
the
metallurgical
lab
will
do
i
think
but
but
there
be
all
sorts
of
formalities
the
englishman
protested
now
you
forget
our
contract
macleod
reminded
him
we
stand
upon
our
contractual
immunity
we
certainly
wo
allow
any
stupid
bureaucratic
interference
with
our
deceased
colleague
wishes
we
have
a
regular
on
our
payroll
in
case
anybody
has
to
have
a
death
certificate
to
keep
him
happy
but
beyond
that
he
shrugged
it
burns
me
up
though
suzanne
maillard
cried
after
the
spaceship
is
built
and
the
moon
is
annexed
to
the
western
union
there
will
be
publicity
and
people
will
eulogize
this
species
of
an
iscariot
heym
who
had
been
staring
at
macleod
in
shocked
unbelief
roused
himself
well
why
not
is
the
creator
of
the
lowiewski
function
transformations
and
the
rules
of
inverse
probabilities
worthy
of
eulogy
he
turned
to
macleod
i
could
have
done
what
you
did
but
maybe
it
was
for
the
best
the
traitor
is
dead
the
mathematician
will
live
forever
you
miss
the
whole
point
macleod
said
both
of
you
it
was
a
question
of
revenge
like
gangsters
bumping
off
a
and
it
was
a
question
of
whitewashing
lowiewski
for
posterity
we
are
the
macleod
research
team
we
owe
no
permanent
allegiance
to
nor
acknowledge
the
authority
of
any
national
sovereignty
or
any
combination
of
nations
we
deal
with
national
governments
as
with
equals
in
consequence
we
must
make
and
enforce
our
own
laws
you
must
understand
that
we
enjoy
this
status
only
on
sufferance
the
nations
of
the
world
tolerate
the
free
scientists
only
because
they
need
us
and
because
they
know
they
can
trust
us
now
no
responsible
government
official
is
going
to
be
deceived
for
a
moment
by
this
suicide
story
we
confected
it
will
be
fully
understood
that
lowiewski
was
a
traitor
and
that
we
found
him
out
and
put
him
to
death
and
as
a
corollary
it
will
be
understood
that
this
team
as
a
team
is
fully
trustworthy
and
that
when
any
individual
team
member
is
found
to
be
untrustworthy
he
will
be
dealt
with
promptly
and
without
public
scandal
in
other
words
it
will
be
understood
from
this
time
on
that
the
macleod
team
is
worthy
of
the
status
it
enjoys
and
the
responsibilities
concomitant
with
it
