a
dry
snow
had
fallen
steadily
throughout
the
still
night
so
that
when
a
cold
upper
wind
cleared
the
sky
gloriously
in
the
morning
the
incongruous
indiana
town
shone
in
a
white
harmony
roof
ledge
and
earth
as
evenly
covered
as
by
moonlight
there
was
no
thaw
only
where
the
line
of
factories
followed
the
big
bend
of
the
frozen
river
their
distant
chimneys
like
exclamation
points
on
a
blank
page
was
there
a
first
threat
against
the
supreme
whiteness
the
wind
passed
quickly
and
on
high
the
shouting
of
the
had
ceased
at
nine
with
pitiful
suddenness
no
laughed
out
on
the
air
and
the
muffling
of
the
thoroughfares
wrought
an
unaccustomed
peace
like
that
of
sunday
this
was
the
phenomenon
which
afforded
the
opening
of
the
morning
debate
of
the
sages
in
the
wide
windows
of
the
national
house
only
such
unfortunates
as
have
so
far
failed
to
visit
canaan
do
not
know
that
the
national
house
is
on
the
main
street
side
of
the
square
and
has
the
advantage
of
being
within
two
walk
of
the
railroad
station
which
is
in
plain
sight
of
the
windows
an
inestimable
benefit
to
the
conversation
of
the
aged
men
who
occupied
these
windows
on
this
white
morning
even
as
they
were
wont
in
summer
to
hold
against
all
comers
the
chairs
on
the
pavement
outside
thence
as
trains
came
and
went
they
commanded
the
city
gates
and
seeking
motives
and
adding
to
the
stock
of
history
narrowly
observed
and
examined
into
all
who
entered
or
departed
their
habit
was
not
singular
he
who
would
foolishly
tax
the
sages
of
canaan
with
a
bucolic
must
first
walk
in
piccadilly
in
early
june
stroll
down
the
corso
in
rome
before
ash
wednesday
or
regard
those
windows
of
fifth
avenue
whose
curtains
are
withdrawn
of
a
winter
sunday
for
in
each
of
these
great
streets
wherever
the
windows
not
of
trade
are
widest
his
eyes
must
behold
wise
men
like
to
those
of
canaan
executing
always
their
same
purpose
the
difference
is
in
favor
of
canaan
the
national
house
was
the
club
but
the
perusal
of
traveller
or
passer
by
was
here
only
the
spume
blown
before
a
stately
ship
of
thought
and
you
might
hear
the
sages
comparing
the
koran
with
the
speeches
of
robert
ingersoll
in
the
days
of
board
sidewalks
had
meant
a
precise
moment
for
canaan
and
even
now
many
years
after
the
first
postman
it
remained
somewhat
definite
to
the
aged
men
for
out
of
deference
to
a
pleasant
olden
custom
and
perhaps
partly
for
an
excuse
to
get
down
to
the
hotel
which
was
not
altogether
in
favor
with
the
elderly
ladies
most
of
them
retained
their
antique
boxes
in
the
happily
in
the
next
building
in
this
connection
it
may
be
written
that
a
subscription
clerk
in
the
office
of
the
chicago
daily
standard
having
noted
a
single
subscriber
from
canaan
was
a
fortnight
later
pleased
to
receive
by
one
mail
nine
subscriptions
from
that
promising
town
if
one
brought
nine
others
in
a
fortnight
thought
he
what
would
nine
bring
in
a
month
amazingly
they
brought
nothing
and
the
rest
was
silence
here
was
a
matter
of
intricate
diplomacy
never
to
come
within
that
youth
his
ken
the
morning
voyage
to
the
long
mocked
as
a
fable
and
screen
by
the
families
of
the
sages
had
grown
so
difficult
to
accomplish
for
one
of
them
colonel
flitcroft
colonel
in
the
war
with
mexico
that
he
had
been
put
to
it
indeed
to
foot
the
against
his
wife
a
lady
of
celebrated
determination
and
at
seventy
and
to
defend
the
rental
of
a
box
which
had
sheltered
but
three
missives
in
four
years
desperation
is
often
inspiration
the
colonel
brilliantly
subscribed
for
the
standard
forgetting
to
give
his
house
address
and
it
took
the
others
just
thirteen
days
to
wring
his
secret
from
him
then
the
standard
served
for
all
had
come
to
mean
that
bright
hour
when
they
all
got
their
feet
on
the
brass
rod
which
protected
the
sills
of
the
two
big
windows
with
the
sizzling
like
kettles
against
the
side
wall
jonas
tabor
who
had
sold
his
hardware
business
magnificently
not
magnificently
for
his
nephew
the
purchaser
some
ten
years
before
was
usually
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
remained
a
bachelor
at
the
last
to
settle
down
with
the
others
though
often
the
first
to
reach
the
hotel
which
he
always
entered
by
a
side
door
because
he
did
not
believe
in
the
treating
system
and
it
was
eskew
arp
only
but
already
a
thoroughly
capable
cynic
who
almost
invariably
opened
the
argument
and
it
was
he
who
discovered
the
sinister
intention
behind
the
weather
of
this
particular
morning
arp
had
not
begun
life
so
sourly
as
a
youth
he
had
been
proud
of
his
given
name
which
had
come
to
him
through
his
mother
family
who
had
made
it
honorable
but
many
years
of
explanations
that
eskew
did
not
indicate
his
initials
had
lowered
his
opinion
of
the
intelligence
and
morality
of
the
race
the
malevolence
of
his
voice
and
manner
this
morning
therefore
when
he
shook
his
finger
at
the
town
beyond
the
windows
and
exclaimed
with
a
bitter
laugh
look
at
it
was
no
surprise
to
his
companions
jest
look
at
it
i
tell
you
the
devil
is
mighty
smart
ha
ha
mighty
smart
through
custom
it
was
the
duty
of
squire
buckalew
justice
of
the
peace
in
to
be
the
first
to
take
up
arp
the
others
looked
to
him
for
it
therefore
he
asked
sharply
what
the
devil
got
to
do
with
snow
everything
to
do
with
it
sir
arp
retorted
it
plain
as
day
to
anybody
with
eyes
and
sense
then
i
wish
you
it
out
said
buckalew
if
you
got
either
by
the
almighty
squire
arp
turned
in
his
chair
with
sudden
heat
if
i
lived
as
long
as
you
you
have
interrupted
the
other
stung
twelve
years
ago
if
i
lived
as
long
as
you
arp
repeated
unwincingly
in
a
louder
voice
and
had
follered
satan
trail
as
long
as
you
have
and
yet
could
recognize
it
when
i
see
it
i
git
converted
and
vote
prohibitionist
do
see
it
interjected
uncle
joe
davey
in
his
querulous
voice
he
was
the
patriarch
of
them
all
ca
find
no
in
the
snow
all
over
it
sir
cried
the
cynic
all
over
it
old
satan
loves
tricks
like
this
here
a
town
that
jest
one
squirmin
mass
of
lies
and
envy
and
vice
and
wickedness
and
corruption
hold
on
exclaimed
colonel
flitcroft
that
a
slander
upon
our
hearths
and
our
government
why
when
i
was
in
the
council
it
was
a
bit
worse
then
arp
returned
unreasonably
jest
you
look
how
the
devil
fools
us
he
drops
down
this
here
virgin
mantle
on
canaan
and
makes
it
look
as
good
as
you
pretend
you
think
it
is
as
good
as
the
room
of
a
country
church
though
that
he
went
off
on
a
tangent
venomously
is
generally
only
another
whited
sepulchre
and
the
superintendent
mighty
apt
to
have
a
bottle
of
whiskey
hid
behind
the
organ
and
look
here
eskew
said
jonas
tabor
that
got
nothin
to
do
with
why
ai
it
answer
me
cried
arp
continuing
without
pause
why
ai
it
ca
you
wait
till
i
git
through
you
listen
to
me
and
when
i
ready
i
listen
to
see
here
began
the
colonel
making
himself
heard
over
three
others
i
want
to
ask
you
no
sir
arp
pounded
the
floor
irascibly
with
his
hickory
stick
do
you
ask
me
anything
how
can
you
tell
that
i
not
going
to
answer
your
question
without
your
asking
it
till
i
got
through
you
listen
first
i
say
here
a
town
of
nearly
thirty
thousand
inhabitants
every
last
one
of
men
women
and
children
selfish
and
cowardly
and
sinful
if
you
could
see
their
innermost
natures
a
town
of
the
ugliest
and
worst
built
houses
in
the
world
and
governed
by
a
lot
of
though
i
hope
it
never
git
down
to
where
the
ministers
can
run
it
and
the
devil
comes
along
and
in
one
night
why
all
you
got
to
do
is
look
at
it
you
think
we
ever
trouble
to
make
it
better
that
what
the
devil
wants
us
to
do
wants
us
to
rest
easy
about
it
and
paints
it
up
to
look
like
a
heaven
of
peace
and
purity
and
sanctified
spirits
snowfall
like
this
would
of
made
lot
turn
the
angel
and
say
that
the
old
home
was
good
enough
for
him
gomorrah
would
of
looked
like
a
puritan
village
though
i
bet
my
last
dollar
that
there
was
a
lot
and
a
whole
lot
that
never
been
told
about
puritan
villages
a
lot
that
what
never
was
interrupted
peter
bradbury
whose
granddaughter
had
lately
announced
her
discovery
that
the
bradburys
were
descended
from
miles
standish
what
was
told
about
puritan
villages
ca
you
wait
arp
accents
were
those
of
pain
have
i
got
any
right
to
present
my
side
of
the
case
ai
we
restrained
enough
to
allow
of
free
speech
here
how
can
we
ever
git
anywhere
in
an
argument
like
this
unless
we
let
one
man
talk
at
a
time
how
go
on
with
your
statement
said
uncle
joe
davey
impatiently
arp
grievance
was
increased
now
listen
to
you
how
many
more
interruptions
are
comin
i
listen
to
the
other
side
but
i
got
to
state
mine
first
have
i
if
i
do
make
my
point
clear
the
use
of
the
argument
argumentation
is
only
the
comparison
of
two
sides
of
a
question
and
you
have
to
see
what
the
first
side
is
before
you
can
compare
it
with
the
other
one
do
you
are
you
all
agreed
to
that
yes
yes
said
the
colonel
go
ahead
we
wo
interrupt
until
you
through
very
well
resumed
arp
with
a
fleeting
expression
of
satisfaction
as
i
said
before
i
wish
to
as
i
said
he
paused
in
some
confusion
as
i
said
argumentation
is
that
is
i
say
he
stopped
again
utterly
at
sea
having
talked
himself
so
far
out
of
his
course
that
he
was
unable
to
recall
either
his
sailing
port
or
his
destination
finally
he
said
feebly
to
save
the
confession
well
go
on
with
your
side
of
it
this
generosity
was
for
a
moment
disconcerting
however
the
quietest
of
the
party
took
up
the
opposition
roger
tabor
a
very
thin
old
man
with
a
face
almost
as
white
as
his
hair
and
melancholy
gentle
gray
eyes
very
unlike
those
of
his
brother
jonas
which
were
dark
and
sharp
and
it
was
to
roger
son
that
jonas
had
so
magnificently
sold
the
hardware
business
roger
was
known
in
canaan
as
the
artist
there
had
never
been
another
of
his
profession
in
the
place
and
the
town
knew
not
the
word
painter
except
in
application
to
the
useful
artisan
who
is
subject
to
there
was
no
indication
of
his
profession
in
the
attire
of
tabor
unless
the
too
apparent
age
of
his
black
felt
hat
and
a
neat
patch
at
the
elbow
of
his
shiny
old
brown
overcoat
might
have
been
taken
as
symbols
of
the
sacrifice
to
his
muse
which
his
life
had
been
he
was
not
a
constant
attendant
of
the
conclave
and
when
he
came
it
was
usually
to
listen
indeed
he
spoke
so
seldom
that
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
they
all
turned
to
him
with
some
surprise
i
suppose
he
began
that
eskew
means
the
devil
is
behind
all
beautiful
things
ugly
ones
too
said
arp
with
a
start
of
recollection
and
i
wish
to
state
not
now
colonel
flitcroft
turned
upon
him
violently
already
stated
it
then
if
he
is
behind
the
ugly
things
too
said
roger
we
must
take
him
either
way
so
let
us
be
glad
of
the
beauty
for
its
own
sake
eskew
says
this
is
a
wicked
town
it
may
be
i
do
know
he
says
it
badly
built
perhaps
it
is
but
it
does
seem
to
me
that
ugly
in
itself
i
do
know
what
its
real
self
is
because
it
wears
so
many
aspects
god
keeps
painting
it
all
the
time
and
never
shows
me
twice
the
same
picture
not
even
two
snowfalls
are
just
alike
nor
the
days
that
follow
them
no
more
than
two
misty
sunsets
are
alike
for
the
color
and
even
the
form
of
the
town
you
call
ugly
are
a
matter
of
the
season
of
the
year
and
of
the
time
of
day
and
of
the
light
and
air
the
ugly
town
is
like
an
endless
gallery
which
you
can
walk
through
from
to
never
seeing
the
same
canvas
twice
no
matter
how
much
you
may
want
to
and
there
the
pathos
of
it
is
it
the
same
with
people
with
the
characters
of
all
of
us
just
as
it
is
with
our
faces
no
face
remains
the
same
for
two
successive
days
it
do
colonel
flitcroft
interrupted
with
an
explosive
and
rueful
incredulity
well
i
like
to
second
thoughts
came
to
him
almost
immediately
and
as
much
out
of
gallantry
as
through
discretion
fearing
that
he
might
be
taken
as
thinking
of
one
at
home
he
relapsed
into
silence
not
so
with
the
others
it
was
as
if
a
firecracker
had
been
dropped
into
a
sleeping
least
of
all
could
arp
contain
himself
at
the
top
of
his
voice
necessarily
he
agreed
with
roger
that
faces
changed
not
only
from
day
to
day
and
not
only
because
of
light
and
air
and
such
things
but
from
hour
to
hour
and
from
minute
to
minute
through
the
hideous
stimulus
of
hypocrisy
the
argument
grew
heated
half
a
dozen
tidy
quarrels
arose
all
the
sages
went
at
it
fiercely
except
roger
tabor
who
stole
quietly
away
the
aged
men
were
enjoying
themselves
thoroughly
especially
those
who
quarrelled
naturally
the
frail
bark
of
the
topic
which
had
been
launched
was
whirled
about
by
too
many
to
remain
long
in
sight
and
soon
became
derelict
while
the
intellectual
dolphins
dove
and
tumbled
in
the
depths
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
arp
emerged
upon
the
surface
and
in
his
mouth
was
this
tell
me
why
ai
the
church
why
ai
the
church
and
the
rest
of
the
believers
in
a
future
life
lookin
for
immortality
at
the
other
end
of
life
too
if
we
immortal
we
always
have
been
then
why
they
ever
speculate
on
what
we
were
before
we
were
born
it
because
they
too
blame
selfish
do
care
a
flapdoodle
about
what
was
all
they
want
is
to
go
on
livin
forever
arp
voice
had
risen
to
an
acrid
triumphancy
when
it
suddenly
faltered
relapsed
to
a
murmur
and
then
to
a
stricken
silence
as
a
tall
fat
man
of
overpowering
aspect
threw
open
the
outer
door
near
by
and
crossed
the
lobby
to
the
clerk
desk
an
awe
fell
upon
the
sages
with
this
advent
they
were
hushed
and
after
a
movement
in
their
chairs
with
a
strange
effect
of
huddling
sat
disconcerted
and
attentive
like
at
the
entrance
of
the
master
the
personage
had
a
big
fat
pink
face
and
a
heavily
undershot
jaw
what
whitish
beard
he
wore
following
his
double
chin
somewhat
after
the
manner
displayed
in
the
portraits
of
henry
the
eighth
his
eyes
very
bright
under
puffed
upper
lids
were
intolerant
and
insultingly
penetrating
despite
their
small
size
their
irritability
held
a
kind
of
hotness
and
yet
the
personage
exuded
frost
not
of
the
weather
all
about
him
you
could
not
imagine
man
or
angel
daring
to
greet
this
being
genially
sooner
throw
a
kiss
to
mount
pilatus
brown
he
said
with
ponderous
hostility
in
a
bull
bass
to
the
clerk
the
kind
of
voice
which
would
have
made
an
express
train
leave
the
track
and
go
round
the
other
way
do
you
hear
me
oh
yes
judge
the
clerk
replied
swiftly
in
tones
as
unlike
those
which
he
used
for
strange
transients
as
a
collector
voice
in
his
ladylove
ear
is
unlike
that
which
he
propels
at
delinquents
do
you
see
that
snow
asked
the
personage
threateningly
yes
judge
brown
essayed
a
placating
smile
yes
indeed
judge
pike
has
your
employer
the
manager
of
this
hotel
seen
that
snow
pursued
the
personage
with
a
gesture
of
unspeakable
solemn
menace
yes
sir
i
think
so
yes
sir
do
you
think
he
fully
understands
that
i
am
the
proprietor
of
this
building
certainly
judge
cer
you
will
inform
him
that
i
do
not
intend
to
be
discommoded
by
his
negligence
as
i
pass
to
my
offices
tell
him
from
me
that
unless
he
keeps
the
sidewalks
in
front
of
this
hotel
clear
of
snow
i
will
cancel
his
lease
their
present
condition
is
outrageous
do
you
understand
me
outrageous
do
you
hear
yes
judge
i
do
so
answered
the
clerk
hoarse
with
respect
see
to
it
this
minute
judge
pike
you
had
better
the
personage
turned
himself
about
and
began
a
grim
progress
towards
the
door
by
which
he
had
entered
his
eyes
fixing
themselves
angrily
upon
the
conclave
at
the
windows
colonel
flitcroft
essayed
a
smile
a
faltering
one
fine
weather
judge
pike
he
said
hopefully
there
was
no
response
of
any
kind
the
undershot
jaw
became
more
intolerant
the
personage
made
his
opinion
of
the
group
disconcertingly
plain
and
the
old
boys
understood
that
he
knew
them
for
a
worthless
lot
of
senile
loafers
as
great
a
nuisance
in
his
building
as
was
the
snow
without
and
much
too
evident
was
his
unspoken
threat
to
see
that
the
manager
cleared
them
out
of
there
before
long
he
nodded
curtly
to
the
only
man
of
substance
among
them
jonas
tabor
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
with
majestic
insult
he
was
millionaire
he
was
one
of
those
dynamic
creatures
who
leave
the
haunting
impression
of
their
wills
behind
them
like
the
tails
of
sheep
like
the
evil
dead
men
have
done
he
left
his
intolerant
image
in
the
ether
for
a
long
time
after
he
had
gone
to
confront
and
confound
the
aged
men
and
hold
them
in
deferential
and
humiliated
silence
each
of
them
was
mysteriously
lowered
in
his
own
estimation
and
knew
that
he
had
been
made
to
seem
futile
and
foolish
in
the
eyes
of
his
fellows
they
were
all
conscious
too
that
the
clerk
had
been
acutely
receptive
of
judge
pike
reading
of
them
that
he
was
reviving
from
his
own
squelchedness
through
the
later
snubbing
of
the
colonel
also
that
he
might
further
seek
to
recover
his
poise
by
an
attack
on
them
for
cluttering
up
the
office
naturally
jonas
tabor
was
the
first
to
speak
judge
pike
mighty
well
he
said
admiringly
yes
he
is
ventured
squire
buckalew
with
deference
mighty
well
yes
sir
echoed
peter
bradbury
mighty
well
he
a
great
man
wheezed
uncle
joe
davey
a
great
man
judge
martin
pike
a
great
man
i
expect
he
has
considerable
on
his
mind
said
the
colonel
who
had
grown
very
red
i
noticed
that
he
hardly
seemed
to
see
us
yes
sir
bradbury
corroborated
with
an
attempt
at
an
amused
laugh
i
noticed
it
too
of
course
a
man
with
all
his
cares
and
interests
must
git
now
and
then
of
course
he
does
said
the
colonel
a
man
with
all
his
responsibilities
yes
that
so
came
a
chorus
of
the
brethren
finding
comfort
and
reassurance
as
their
voices
and
spirits
began
to
recover
from
the
blight
there
a
party
at
the
judge
said
bradbury
kind
of
a
ball
mamie
pike
givin
for
the
young
folks
quite
a
doin
i
hear
that
another
thing
that
ruining
canaan
arp
declared
morosely
these
entertainments
they
have
nowadays
spend
all
the
money
out
of
town
band
from
indianapolis
chicken
salad
and
darkey
waiters
from
chicago
and
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
this
town
goin
to
do
about
the
nigger
question
what
about
it
asked
davey
belligerently
what
about
it
arp
mocked
fiercely
you
better
say
about
it
well
what
maintained
davey
steadfastly
i
bet
there
ai
any
less
than
four
thousand
niggers
in
canaan
arp
hammered
the
floor
with
his
stick
every
last
one
of
criminals
and
more
comin
on
every
train
no
such
a
thing
said
squire
buckalew
living
up
to
his
bounden
duty
you
look
down
the
street
there
the
comin
in
now
i
bet
you
a
straight
cigar
there
ai
ary
nigger
on
the
whole
train
except
the
porters
what
kind
of
a
way
to
argue
is
that
demanded
arp
hotly
bettin
ai
proof
is
it
besides
that
the
through
express
from
the
east
i
meant
trains
from
the
south
you
did
say
so
retorted
buckalew
triumphantly
stick
to
your
bet
eskew
stick
to
your
bet
my
bet
cried
the
outraged
eskew
who
offered
to
bet
you
did
replied
the
squire
with
perfect
assurance
and
sincerity
the
others
supported
him
in
the
heartiest
spirit
of
and
war
and
joy
were
unconfined
a
decrepit
hack
or
two
a
couple
of
surreys
and
a
few
drove
by
bearing
the
newly
arrived
and
their
valises
the
hotel
omnibus
depositing
several
commercial
travellers
at
the
door
a
solitary
figure
came
from
the
station
on
foot
and
when
it
appeared
within
fair
range
of
the
window
uncle
joe
davey
who
had
but
hovered
on
the
flanks
of
the
combat
first
removed
his
spectacles
and
wiped
them
as
though
distrusting
the
vision
they
offered
him
then
replacing
them
scanned
anew
the
approaching
figure
and
uttered
a
smothered
cry
my
lord
he
gasped
what
this
look
there
they
looked
a
truce
came
involuntarily
and
they
sat
in
paralytic
silence
as
the
figure
made
its
stately
and
sensational
progress
along
main
street
not
only
the
aged
men
were
smitten
men
shovelling
snow
from
the
pavements
stopped
suddenly
in
their
labors
two
women
talking
busily
on
a
doorstep
were
stilled
and
remained
in
frozen
attitudes
as
it
passed
a
grocer
clerk
crossing
the
pavement
carrying
a
heavily
laden
basket
to
his
delivery
wagon
halted
as
the
figure
came
near
and
then
making
a
pivot
of
his
heels
as
it
went
by
behaved
towards
it
as
does
the
magnetic
needle
to
the
pole
it
was
that
of
a
tall
gentleman
cheerfully
though
somewhat
with
ennui
enduring
his
nineteenth
winter
his
long
and
slender
face
he
wore
smiling
beneath
an
accurately
cut
plaster
of
dark
hair
cornicing
his
forehead
a
fashion
followed
by
many
youths
of
that
year
this
perfect
bang
was
shown
under
a
round
black
hat
whose
rim
was
so
small
as
almost
not
to
be
there
at
all
and
the
head
was
supported
by
a
of
collar
rising
three
inches
above
the
blue
billows
of
a
puffed
cravat
upon
which
floated
a
large
hollow
pearl
his
ulster
sporting
a
big
cape
at
the
shoulders
and
a
tasselled
hood
over
the
cape
was
of
a
rough
scotch
cloth
patterned
in
faint
squares
the
size
of
and
it
was
so
long
that
the
skirts
trailed
in
the
snow
his
legs
were
lost
in
the
accurately
creased
voluminous
garments
that
were
the
tailors
canny
reaction
from
the
tight
trousers
with
which
the
had
begun
they
were
in
color
a
palish
russet
broadly
striped
with
gray
and
in
size
surpassed
the
milder
spirit
of
fashion
so
far
as
they
permitted
a
liberal
knee
action
to
take
place
almost
without
superficial
effect
upon
his
feet
glistened
long
shoes
shaped
save
for
the
heels
like
sharp
these
were
partially
protected
by
low
gaiters
with
flat
shiny
brown
buttons
in
one
hand
the
youth
swung
a
perhaps
an
inch
and
a
half
in
diameter
the
other
carried
a
yellow
leather
upon
the
outer
side
of
which
glittered
the
initials
e
b
he
was
smoking
but
walked
with
his
head
up
making
use
however
of
a
gait
at
that
time
new
to
canaan
a
seeming
superbly
irresponsible
lounge
engendering
much
motion
of
the
shoulders
producing
an
effect
of
carelessness
combined
with
independence
an
effect
which
the
innocent
have
been
known
to
hail
as
an
unconscious
one
he
looked
about
him
as
he
came
smilingly
with
an
expression
of
princely
amusement
as
an
elderly
cabinet
minister
say
strolling
about
a
village
where
he
had
spent
some
months
in
his
youth
a
hamlet
which
he
had
then
thought
large
and
imposing
but
which
being
revisited
after
years
of
cosmopolitan
glory
appeals
to
his
whimsy
and
his
pity
the
youth
glance
at
the
unmistakably
said
ah
i
recall
that
odd
little
box
i
thought
it
quite
large
in
the
days
before
i
became
what
i
am
now
and
i
dare
say
the
good
townsfolk
still
think
it
an
imposing
structure
with
everything
in
sight
he
deigned
to
be
amused
especially
with
the
old
faces
in
the
national
house
windows
to
these
he
waved
his
stick
with
airy
graciousness
my
soul
said
davey
it
seems
to
know
some
of
us
yes
agreed
arp
his
voice
recovered
and
know
it
you
do
exclaimed
the
colonel
i
do
and
so
do
you
it
fanny
louden
boy
come
home
for
his
christmas
holidays
by
george
you
right
cried
flitcroft
i
recognize
him
now
but
what
the
matter
with
him
asked
bradbury
eagerly
has
he
joined
some
troupe
not
a
bit
replied
eskew
he
went
east
to
college
last
fall
do
they
make
the
boys
wear
them
clothes
persisted
bradbury
is
it
some
kind
of
uniform
i
do
care
what
it
is
said
jonas
tabor
if
i
was
henry
louden
i
would
let
him
wear
around
here
oh
you
would
would
you
jonas
arp
employed
the
accents
of
sarcasm
i
like
to
see
henry
louden
try
to
interfere
with
bantry
fanny
lock
the
old
fool
up
in
the
cellar
the
lofty
vision
lurched
out
of
view
i
reckon
said
the
colonel
leaning
forward
to
see
the
last
of
it
i
reckon
henry
louden
about
the
saddest
case
of
abused
i
ever
saw
it
his
own
fault
said
arp
twice
not
havin
sense
enough
not
to
marry
him
with
a
son
of
his
own
too
yes
assented
the
colonel
marryin
a
widow
with
a
son
of
her
own
and
that
widow
fanny
was
it
just
the
same
with
her
first
husband
bantry
davey
asked
not
for
information
as
he
immediately
answered
himself
you
bet
it
was
did
she
always
rule
the
roost
yes
she
did
she
made
a
god
of
from
the
day
he
was
born
bantry
house
was
run
for
him
like
louden
is
now
and
look
exclaimed
arp
with
satisfaction
at
the
way
turned
out
he
ai
turned
out
at
all
yet
he
too
young
said
buckalew
besides
clothes
do
make
the
man
was
he
smokin
a
cigareet
cried
eskew
triumphantly
this
was
final
it
a
pity
henry
louden
ca
do
something
for
his
own
son
said
bradbury
why
do
he
send
him
away
to
college
fanny
wo
let
him
chuckled
arp
malevolently
takes
all
their
spare
change
to
keep
there
in
style
i
do
blame
her
certainly
acts
the
fool
but
that
joe
louden
is
the
orneriest
boy
i
ever
saw
in
an
ornery
he
always
was
kind
of
mischeevous
admitted
buckalew
i
do
think
he
mean
though
and
it
does
seem
kind
of
not
just
right
that
father
money
bantry
did
leave
anything
to
speak
of
has
to
go
to
keepin
on

of
the
land

three
million
dollars
for

eskew
is

star
bicycle
and
gamblin
with
niggers
and
none
of
the
nice
young

of

a
thing
to

that
next
door
to
louden
and
the
others
do
have
much
to
do
with
her
neither
i
can
tell
ye
that
arie
tabor
colonel
flitcroft
caught
him
surreptitiously
by
the
arm
sh
eskew
he
whispered
look
out
what
you
sayin
you
need
mind
me
jonas
tabor
spoke
up
crisply
i
washed
my
hands
of
all
responsibility
for
roger
branch
of
the
family
long
ago
never
was
one
of
had
the
energy
or
brains
to
make
a
decent
livin
beginning
with
roger
not
one
worth
his
salt
i
set
roger
son
up
in
business
and
all
the
return
he
ever
made
me
was
to
go
into
bankruptcy
and
take
to
drink
till
he
died
a
sot
like
his
wife
did
of
shame
i
done
all
i
could
when
i
handed
him
over
my
store
and
i
never
expect
to
lift
a
finger
for
again
ariel
tabor
my
grandniece
but
she
did
act
like
it
and
you
can
say
anything
you
like
about
her
for
what
i
care
the
last
time
i
spoke
to
her
was
a
year
and
a
half
ago
and
i
do
reckon
i
ever
trouble
to
again
how
was
that
jonas
quickly
inquired
davey
who
being
the
eldest
of
the
party
was
the
most
curious
what
happened
she
was
out
in
the
street
up
on
that
high
bicycle
of
joe
louden
he
was
teachin
her
to
ride
and
she
was
sittin
on
it
like
a
man
does
i
stopped
and
told
her
she
was
respectable
sixteen
years
old
on
seventeen
what
did
she
say
laughed
said
jonas
his
voice
becoming
louder
as
the
recital
of
his
wrongs
renewed
their
sting
in
his
soul
laughed
what
did
you
do
i
went
up
to
her
and
told
her
she
was
a
decent
girl
and
shook
the
wheel
tabor
illustrated
by
seizing
the
lapels
of
joe
davey
and
shaking
him
i
told
her
if
her
grandfather
had
any
spunk
she
git
an
hidin
for
behavin
that
way
and
i
shook
the
wheel
again
here
tabor
forgetting
in
the
wrath
incited
by
the
recollection
that
he
had
not
to
do
with
an
inanimate
object
swung
the
gasping
and
helpless
davey
rapidly
back
and
forth
in
his
chair
i
shook
it
good
and
hard
what
did
she
do
then
asked
peter
bradbury
fell
off
on
me
replied
jonas
violently
on
purpose
i
wisht
she
killed

said
davey
in
a
choking
voice
as
released
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
on
purpose
repeated
jonas
and
smashed
a
straw
hat
i
had
had
three
months
all
to
pieces
so
it
could
be
fixed
and
what
then
pursued
bradbury
she
ran
replied
jonas
bitterly
ran
and
joe
louden
joe
louden
he
paused
and
gulped
what
did
he
do
peter
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
eagerly
the
narrator
of
the
outrage
gulped
again
and
opened
and
shut
his
mouth
before
responding
he
said
if
i
did
pay
for
a
broken
spoke
on
his
wheel
he
have
to
sue
me
no
one
inquired
if
jonas
had
paid
and
jonas
said
no
more
the
recollection
of
his
wrongs
together
with
the
illustrative
violence
offered
to
davey
had
been
too
much
for
him
he
sank
back
panting
in
his
chair
his
hands
fluttering
nervously
over
his
heart
and
closed
his
eyes
i
wonder
why
ruminated
bradbury
i
wonder
why
bantry
walked
up
from
the
deepo
do
seem
much
like
his
style
should
think
he
of
rode
up
in
a
hack
sho
said
uncle
joe
davey
his
breath
recovered
he
wanted
to
walk
up
past
judge
pike
to
see
if
there
was
a
show
of
mamie
bein
at
the
window
and
give
her
a
chance
to
look
at
that
college
uniform
and
and
new
walk
of
his
arp
began
to
show
signs
of
uneasiness
i
like
mighty
well
to
know
he
said
shifting
round
in
his
chair
if
there
anybody
here
that
been
able
to
answer
the
question
i
put
yesterday
just
before
we
went
home
you
all
tried
to
but
i
hear
anything
i
could
consider
anyways
near
even
a
fair
argument
who
tried
to
asked
buckalew
sharply
sitting
up
straight
what
question
what
proof
can
you
bring
me
began
arp
deliberately
that
we
folks
modernly
ai
more
degenerate
than
the
ancient
romans
ii
a
rescue
main
street
already
muffled
by
the
snow
added
to
its
quietude
a
frozen
hush
where
the
youth
pursued
his
course
along
its
white
straight
way
none
was
there
in
whom
impertinence
overmastered
astonishment
or
who
recovered
from
the
sight
in
time
to
jeer
with
effect
no
trab
boy
gathered
courage
to
enact
in
the
thoroughfare
a
scene
of
mockery
and
of
joy
leaving
business
at
a
temporary
behind
him
bantry
swept
his
long
coat
steadily
over
the
snow
and
soon
emerged
upon
that
part
of
the
street
where
the
mart
gave
way
to
the
home
the
comfortable
houses
stood
pleasantly
back
from
the
street
with
plenty
of
lawn
and
shrubbery
about
them
and
often
along
the
the
laden
branches
of
small
cedars
bending
low
with
their
burden
showered
the
young
man
swinging
shoulders
glitteringly
as
he
brushed
by
and
now
that
expression
he
wore
the
indulgent
amusement
of
a
man
of
the
world
began
to
disintegrate
and
show
signs
of
change
it
became
finely
grave
as
of
a
high
conventionality
lofty
assured
and
mannered
as
he
approached
the
pike
mansion
the
remotest
stranger
must
at
once
perceive
that
the
canaan
papers
could
not
have
called
it
otherwise
without
pain
it
was
a
big
house
product
of
the
frowning
under
an
outrageously
insistent
mansard
capped
by
a
cupola
and
staring
out
of
long
windows
overtopped
with
ornamental
slabs
two
deer
painted
twins
of
the
same
mould
stood
on
opposite
sides
of
the
front
walk
their
backs
towards
it
and
each
other
their
bodies
in
profile
to
the
street
their
necks
bent
however
so
that
they
gazed
upon
the
yet
gazed
without
emotion
two
large
calm
dogs
guarded
the
top
of
the
steps
leading
to
the
they
also
were
twins
and
of
the
same
interesting
metal
though
honored
beyond
the
deer
by
coats
of
black
paint
and
shellac
it
was
to
be
remarked
that
these
dogs
were
of
no
distinguishable
species
or
breed
yet
they
were
unmistakably
dogs
the
dullest
must
have
recognized
them
as
such
at
a
glance
which
was
perhaps
enough
it
was
a
hideous
house
cold
yet
harshly
aggressive
a
house
whose
exterior
provoked
a
shuddering
guess
of
the
brass
lambrequins
and
plush
fringes
within
a
solid
house
obviously
nay
blatantly
the
residence
of
the
principal
citizen
whom
it
had
grown
to
resemble
as
is
the
impish
habit
of
houses
and
it
sat
in
the
middle
of
its
flat
acre
of
snowy
lawn
like
a
rich
fat
man
enraged
and
sitting
straight
up
in
bed
to
swear
and
yet
there
was
one
charming
thing
about
this
ugly
house
some
workmen
were
enclosing
a
large
side
porch
with
heavy
canvas
evidently
for
festal
purposes
looking
out
from
between
two
strips
of
the
canvas
was
the
rosy
and
delicate
face
of
a
pretty
girl
smiling
upon
eugene
bantry
as
he
passed
it
was
an
obviously
pretty
face
all
the
youth
and
prettiness
there
for
your
very
first
glance
elaborately
pretty
like
the
splendid
profusion
of
hair
about
and
above
it
hair
upon
which
so
much
time
had
been
spent
that
a
circle
of
large
round
curls
rose
above
the
mass
of
it
like
golden
bubbles
tipping
a
coronet
the
girl
fingers
were
pressed
thoughtfully
against
her
chin
as
eugene
strode
into
view
immediately
her
eyes
widened
and
brightened
he
swung
along
the
fence
with
the
handsomest
appearance
of
unconsciousness
until
he
reached
a
point
nearly
opposite
her
then
he
turned
his
head
as
if
haphazardly
and
met
her
eyes
at
once
she
threw
out
her
hand
towards
him
waving
him
a
greeting
a
gesture
which
as
her
fingers
had
been
near
her
lips
was
a
little
like
throwing
a
kiss
he
crooked
an
elbow
and
with
a
military
movement
removed
his
hat
extended
it
to
full
at
the
returned
it
to
his
head
with
precision
this
was
also
new
to
canaan
he
was
letting
mamie
pike
have
it
all
at
once
the
impression
was
as
large
as
he
could
have
desired
she
remained
at
the
opening
in
the
canvas
and
watched
him
until
he
wagged
his
shoulders
round
the
next
corner
and
disappeared
into
a
cross
street
as
for
eugene
he
was
calm
with
a
great
calm
and
very
red
he
had
not
covered
a
great
distance
however
before
his
gravity
was
replaced
by
his
former
smiling
look
of
the
landed
gentleman
amused
by
the
innocent
pastimes
of
the
peasants
though
there
was
no
one
in
sight
except
a
woman
sweeping
some
snow
from
the
front
steps
of
a
cottage
and
she
not
perceiving
him
retired
without
knowing
her
loss
he
had
come
to
a
thinly
built
part
of
the
town
the
perfect
quiet
of
which
made
the
sound
he
heard
as
he
opened
the
picket
gate
of
his
own
home
all
the
more
startling
it
was
a
scream
loud
frantic
and
eugene
stopped
with
the
gate
half
open
out
of
the
winter
skeleton
of
a
at
one
side
of
the
brick
house
a
girl
of
seventeen
precipitated
herself
through
the
air
in
the
midst
of
a
shower
of
torn
which
she
threw
before
her
as
she
leaped
she
lit
upon
her
toes
and
headed
for
the
gate
at
top
speed
pursued
by
a
pale
young
man
whose
thin
arms
strove
spasmodically
to
reach
her
scattering
snow
behind
them
hair
flying
the
pair
sped
on
like
two
tattered
branches
before
a
high
wind
for
as
they
came
nearer
eugene
of
whom
in
the
tensity
of
their
flight
they
took
no
note
it
was
to
be
seen
that
both
were
so
shabbily
dressed
as
to
be
almost
ragged
there
was
a
brown
patch
upon
the
girl
faded
skirt
at
the
knee
the
shortness
of
the
garment
indicating
its
age
to
be
something
over
three
years
as
well
as
permitting
the
knowledge
to
become
more
general
than
befitting
that
her
cotton
stockings
had
been
clumsily
darned
in
several
places
her
pursuer
was
in
as
evil
case
his
trousers
displayed
a
tendency
to
fringedness
at
pocket
and
heel
his
coat
blowing
open
as
he
ran
threw
pennants
of
torn
lining
to
the
breeze
and
made
it
too
plain
that
there
were
but
three
buttons
on
his
waistcoat
the
girl
ran
beautifully
but
a
fleeter
foot
was
behind
her
and
though
she
dodged
and
evaded
like
a
creature
of
the
woods
the
reaching
hand
fell
upon
the
loose
sleeve
of
her
red
blouse
nor
fell
lightly
she
gave
a
wrench
of
frenzy
the
antique
fabric
refused
the
strain
parted
at
the
shoulder
seam
so
thoroughly
that
the
whole
sleeve
came
away
but
not
to
its
owner
release
for
she
had
been
brought
round
by
the
jerk
so
that
agile
as
she
had
shown
herself
the
pursuer
threw
an
arm
about
her
neck
before
she
could
twist
away
and
held
her
there
was
a
sharp
struggle
as
short
as
it
was
fierce
neither
of
these
extraordinary
wrestlers
spoke
they
fought
victory
hung
in
the
balance
for
perhaps
four
seconds
then
the
girl
was
thrown
heavily
upon
her
back
in
such
a
turmoil
of
snow
that
she
seemed
to
be
the
mere
nucleus
of
a
white
comet
she
struggled
to
get
up
plying
knee
and
elbow
with
a
very
anguish
of
determination
but
her
opponent
held
her
pinioned
both
her
wrists
with
one
hand
and
with
the
other
rubbed
great
handfuls
of
snow
into
her
face
sparing
neither
mouth
nor
eyes
you
will
he
cried
you
will
tear
up
my
pictures
a
dirty
trick
and
you
get
washed
for
it
half
suffocated
choking
gasping
she
still
fought
on
squirming
and
kicking
with
such
spirit
that
the
pair
of
them
appeared
to
the
beholder
like
figures
of
mist
writhing
in
a
fountain
of
snow
more
violence
was
to
mar
the
peace
of
morning
unexpectedly
attacked
from
the
rear
the
conqueror
was
seized
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
one
wrist
and
jerked
to
his
feet
simultaneously
receiving
a
succession
of
kicks
from
his
assailant
prompted
by
an
entirely
natural
curiosity
he
essayed
to
turn
his
head
to
see
who
this
might
be
but
a
twist
of
his
forearm
and
the
pressure
of
strong
fingers
under
his
ear
constrained
him
to
remain
as
he
was
therefore
abandoning
resistance
and
oddly
enough
accepting
without
comment
the
indication
that
his
captor
desired
to
remain
for
the
moment
incognito
he
resorted
calmly
to
explanations
she
tore
up
a
picture
of
mine
he
said
receiving
the
punishment
without
apparent
emotion
she
seemed
to
think
because
she
drawn
it
herself
she
had
a
right
to
there
was
a
slight
whimsical
droop
at
the
corner
of
his
mouth
as
he
spoke
which
might
have
been
thought
characteristic
of
him
he
was
an
boy
not
though
very
thin
and
not
tall
his
pallor
was
clear
and
even
as
though
constitutional
the
features
were
delicate
almost
childlike
but
they
were
very
slightly
distorted
through
nervous
habit
to
an
expression
at
once
wistful
and
humorous
one
eyebrow
was
a
shade
higher
than
the
other
one
side
of
the
mouth
slightly
drawn
down
the
eyelids
twitched
a
little
habitually
the
fine
blue
eyes
themselves
were
almost
comically
reproachful
the
look
of
a
puppy
who
thinks
you
would
not
have
beaten
him
if
you
had
known
what
was
in
his
heart
all
of
this
was
in
the
quality
of
his
voice
too
as
he
said
to
his
invisible
captor
with
an
air
of
detachment
from
any
personal
feeling
what
peculiar
shoes
you
wear
i
do
think
i
ever
felt
any
so
pointed
before
the
rescuing
knight
took
no
thought
of
offering
to
help
the
persecuted
damsel
to
arise
instead
he
tightened
his
grip
upon
the
neck
until
perforce
water
not
tears
started
from
the
latter
eyes
you
miserable
little
muff
said
the
conqueror
what
the
devil
do
you
mean
making
this
scene
on
our
front
lawn
why
it
eugene
exclaimed
the
helpless
one
they
did
expect
you
till
when
did
you
get
in
just
in
time
to
give
you
a
lesson
my
buck
replied
bantry
grimly
in
good
time
for
that
my
playful
he
began
to
twist
the
other
wrist
a
treatment
of
bone
and
ligament
in
the
application
of
which
and
even
freshmen
are
often
adept
eugene
made
the
torture
acute
and
was
apparently
enjoying
the
work
when
suddenly
without
any
manner
of
warning
he
received
an
astounding
blow
upon
the
left
ear
which
half
stunned
him
for
the
moment
and
sent
his
hat
flying
and
himself
reeling
so
great
was
the
surprise
and
shock
of
it
it
was
not
a
slap
not
an
push
nothing
like
it
but
a
fierce
blow
from
a
clinched
fist
with
the
shoulder
behind
it
and
it
was
the
girl
who
had
given
it
do
you
dare
to
touch
joe
she
cried
passionately
do
you
lay
a
finger
on
him
furious
and
red
he
staggered
round
to
look
at
her
you
wretched
little
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
broke
out
do
you
touch
joe
she
panted
do
you
her
breath
caught
and
there
was
a
break
in
her
voice
as
she
faced
him
she
could
not
finish
the
repetition
of
that
cry
do
you
touch
joe
but
there
was
no
break
in
the
spirit
that
passion
of
protection
which
had
dealt
the
blow
both
boys
looked
at
her
something
aghast
she
stood
before
them
trembling
with
rage
and
shivering
with
cold
in
the
sudden
wind
which
had
come
up
her
hair
had
fallen
and
blew
across
her
streaming
face
in
brown
one
of
the
stockings
had
come
down
and
hung
about
her
shoe
in
folds
full
of
snow
the
arm
which
had
lost
its
sleeve
was
bare
and
wet
thin
as
the
arm
of
a
growing
boy
it
shook
convulsively
and
was
red
from
shoulder
to
clinched
fist
she
was
covered
with
snow
mists
of
white
drift
blew
across
her
mercifully
half
veiling
her
eugene
recovered
himself
he
swung
round
upon
his
heel
restored
his
hat
to
his
head
with
precision
picked
up
his
stick
and
touched
his
with
it
carry
that
into
the
house
he
said
indifferently
to
his
do
you
do
it
said
the
girl
hotly
between
her
chattering
teeth
eugene
turned
towards
her
wearing
the
sharp
edge
of
a
smile
not
removing
his
eyes
from
her
face
he
produced
with
deliberation
a
flat
silver
box
from
a
pocket
took
therefrom
a
cigarette
replaced
the
box
extracted
a
smaller
silver
box
from
another
pocket
shook
out
of
it
a
fusee
slowly
lit
the
cigarette
this
in
a
splendid
silence
which
he
finally
broke
to
say
languidly
but
with
particular
distinctness
ariel
tabor
go
home
the
girl
teeth
stopped
chattering
her
lips
remaining
parted
she
shook
the
hair
out
of
her
eyes
and
stared
at
him
as
if
she
did
not
understand
but
joe
louden
who
had
picked
up
the
obediently
burst
into
cheerful
laughter
that
it
he
cried
gayly
that
the
way
to
talk
to
her
stow
it
you
young
cub
replied
eugene
not
turning
to
him
do
you
think
i
trying
to
be
amusing
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
it
joe
began
but
if
i
mean
interrupted
the
other
not
relaxing
his
faintly
smiling
stare
at
the
girl
i
mean
that
ariel
tabor
is
to
go
home
really
we
have
this
kind
of
thing
occurring
upon
our
front
lawn
the
flush
upon
her
wet
cheeks
deepened
and
became
dark
even
her
arm
grew
redder
as
she
gazed
back
at
him
in
his
eyes
was
patent
his
complete
realization
of
the
figure
she
cut
of
this
bare
arm
of
the
strewn
hair
of
the
fallen
stocking
of
the
ragged
shoulder
of
her
blouse
of
her
patched
short
skirt
of
the
whole
dishevelled
little
figure
he
was
the
master
of
the
house
and
he
was
sending
her
home
as
children
are
sent
home
by
neighbors
the
immobile
amused
superiority
of
this
proprietor
of
silver
boxes
this
wearer
of
strange
and
brilliant
garments
became
slightly
intensified
as
he
pointed
to
the
fallen
sleeve
a
rag
of
red
and
snow
lying
near
her
feet
you
might
take
that
with
you
he
said
interrogatively
her
gaze
had
not
wavered
in
meeting
his
but
at
this
her
eyelashes
began
to
wink
uncontrollably
her
chin
to
tremble
she
bent
over
the
sleeve
and
picked
it
up
before
joe
louden
who
had
started
towards
her
could
do
it
for
her
then
turning
her
head
still
bent
so
that
her
face
was
hidden
from
both
of
them
she
ran
out
of
the
gate
do
go
joe
called
after
her
vehemently
go
just
to
show
what
a
fool
you
are
to
think
in
earnest
he
would
have
followed
but
his
caught
him
by
the
arm
do
stop
her
said
eugene
ca
you
tell
when
i
am
in
earnest
you
bally
muff
i
know
you
are
returned
the
other
in
a
low
voice
i
did
want
her
to
think
so
for
your
sake
thousands
of
thanks
said
eugene
airily
you
are
a
wise
young
judge
she
could
stay
in
that
state
could
she
i
sent
her
for
her
own
good
she
could
have
gone
in
the
house
and
your
mother
might
have
loaned
her
a
jacket
returned
joe
swallowing
you
had
no
business
to
make
her
go
out
in
the
street
like
that
eugene
laughed
there
is
a
soul
in
sight
and
there
she
all
right
now
she
home
ariel
had
run
along
the
fence
until
she
came
to
the
next
gate
which
opened
upon
a
walk
leading
to
a
shabby
meandering
old
house
of
one
story
with
a
very
long
low
porch
once
painted
white
running
the
full
length
of
the
front
ariel
sprang
upon
the
porch
and
disappeared
within
the
house
joe
stood
looking
after
her
his
eyelashes
winking
as
had
hers
you
ought
to
have
treated
her
that
way
he
said
huskily
eugene
laughed
again
how
were
you
treating
her
when
i
came
up
you
bully
her
all
you
want
to
yourself
but
nobody
else
must
say
even
a
fatherly
word
to
her
that
was
bullying
explained
joe
we
fight
all
the
time
mais
oui
assented
eugene
i
fancy
what
said
the
other
blankly
pick
up
that
again
and
come
on
commanded
bantry
tartly
where
the
mater
joe
stared
at
him
where
what
the
mater
was
the
frowning
reply
oh
yes
i
know
said
joe
looking
at
his
curiously
i
seen
it
in
stories
she
you
be
a
surprise
you
wearing
lots
of
clothes
i
suppose
it
will
seem
so
to
canaan
returned
the
other
weariedly
governor
feeling
fit
i
never
saw
him
joe
replied
then
caught
himself
oh
i
see
what
you
mean
yes
he
all
right
they
had
come
into
the
hall
and
eugene
was
removing
the
long
coat
while
his
looked
at
him
thoughtfully
asked
the
latter
in
a
softened
voice
have
you
seen
mamie
pike
yet
you
will
find
my
young
friend
responded
bantry
if
you
ever
go
about
much
outside
of
canaan
that
ladies
names
are
not
supposed
to
be
mentioned
indiscriminately
it
only
said
joe
that
i
wanted
to
say
that
there
a
dance
at
their
house
i
suppose
you
be
going
certainly
are
you
both
knew
that
the
question
was
needless
but
joe
answered
gently
oh
no
of
course
not
he
leaned
over
and
fumbled
with
one
foot
as
if
to
fasten
a
loose
she
would
be
very
likely
to
ask
me
well
what
about
it
only
that
that
arie
tabor
going
indeed
eugene
paused
on
the
stairs
which
he
had
begun
to
ascend
very
interesting
i
thought
continued
joe
hopefully
straightening
up
to
look
at
him
that
maybe
you
dance
with
her
i
do
believe
many
will
ask
her
i
afraid
they
wo
and
if
you
would
even
only
once
it
would
kind
of
make
up
for
he
faltered
for
out
there
he
finished
nodding
his
head
in
the
direction
of
the
gate
if
eugene
vouchsafed
any
reply
it
was
lost
in
a
loud
shrill
cry
from
above
as
a
small
intensely
woman
in
blue
silk
ran
down
the
stairs
to
meet
him
and
caught
him
tearfully
in
her
arms
dear
old
mater
said
eugene
joe
went
out
of
the
quickly
iii
old
hopes
the
door
which
ariel
had
entered
opened
upon
a
narrow
hall
and
down
this
she
ran
to
her
own
room
passing
with
face
averted
the
entrance
to
the
broad
chamber
that
had
served
roger
tabor
as
a
studio
for
almost
fifty
years
he
was
sitting
there
now
in
a
hopeless
and
disconsolate
attitude
with
his
back
towards
the
double
doors
which
were
open
and
had
been
open
since
their
hinges
had
begun
to
give
way
when
ariel
was
a
child
hearing
her
step
he
called
her
name
but
did
not
turn
and
receiving
no
answer
sighed
faintly
as
he
heard
her
own
door
close
upon
her
then
as
his
eyes
wandered
about
the
many
canvases
which
leaned
against
the
dingy
walls
he
sighed
again
usually
they
showed
their
brown
backs
but
he
had
turned
them
all
to
face
outward
twilight
sunset
moonlight
the
in
moonlight
dawn
morning
noon
main
street
at
noon
high
summer
first
spring
red
autumn
midwinter
all
were
there
illimitably
detailed
worked
to
a
smoothness
like
a
glaze
and
all
lovingly
done
with
unthinkable
labor
and
there
were
italian
damsels
with
careful
hair
two
figures
together
one
blonde
the
other
as
brunette
as
lampblack
the
blonde
in
pink
satin
and
blue
slippers
leaning
against
a
pillar
and
smiling
over
the
golden
coins
for
which
she
had
exchanged
her
posies
the
brunette
seated
at
her
feet
weeping
upon
an
unsold
bouquet
there
were
fisher
lads
wading
with
on
their
shoulders
there
was
a
tying
the
ribbon
on
pussy
neck
there
were
portraits
in
oil
and
petrifactions
in
crayon
as
hard
and
tight
as
the
purses
of
those
who
had
refused
to
accept
them
leaving
them
upon
their
maker
hands
because
the
likeness
had
failed
after
a
time
the
old
man
got
up
went
to
his
easel
near
a
window
and
sighing
again
began
patiently
to
work
upon
one
of
these
failures
a
portrait
in
oil
of
a
savage
old
lady
which
he
was
doing
from
a
photograph
the
expression
of
the
mouth
and
the
shape
of
the
nose
had
not
pleased
her
descendants
and
the
beneficiaries
under
the
will
and
it
was
upon
the
images
of
these
features
that
roger
labored
he
leaned
far
forward
with
his
face
close
to
the
canvas
holding
his
brushes
after
the
spencerian
fashion
working
steadily
through
the
afternoon
and
when
the
light
grew
dimmer
leaning
closer
to
his
canvas
to
see
when
it
had
become
almost
dark
in
the
room
he
lit
a
with
a
shade
and
placing
it
upon
a
table
beside
him
continued
to
paint
ariel
voice
interrupted
him
at
last
it
grandfather
she
called
gently
from
the
doorway
behind
him
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
conscious
for
the
first
time
of
how
tired
he
had
grown
i
suppose
so
he
said
though
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
just
getting
my
hand
in
his
eyes
brightened
for
a
moment
i
declare
i
believe
i
caught
it
a
great
deal
better
come
and
look
ariel
does
it
seem
to
you
that
i
getting
it
those
pearly
shadows
in
the
flesh
i
sure
of
it
those
people
ought
to
be
very
proud
to
have
it
she
came
to
him
quietly
took
the
palette
and
brushes
from
his
hands
and
began
to
clean
them
standing
in
the
shadow
behind
him
it
too
good
for
them
i
wonder
if
it
is
he
said
slowly
leaning
forward
and
curving
his
hands
about
his
eyes
so
as
to
shut
off
everything
from
his
view
except
the
canvas
i
wonder
if
it
is
he
repeated
then
his
hands
dropped
sadly
in
his
lap
and
he
sank
back
again
with
a
patient
kind
of
revulsion
no
no
it
is
i
always
think
they
good
when
just
finished
them
i
been
fooled
that
way
all
my
life
they
look
the
same
afterwards
they
always
beautiful
she
said
softly
ah
ah
he
sighed
now
roger
she
cried
with
cheerful
sharpness
continuing
her
work
i
know
he
said
with
a
plaintive
laugh
i
know
sometimes
i
think
that
all
my
reward
has
been
in
the
few
minutes
i
had
just
after
finishing
them
during
those
few
minutes
i
seem
to
see
in
them
all
that
i
wanted
to
put
in
them
i
see
it
because
what
i
been
trying
to
express
is
still
so
warm
in
my
own
eyes
that
i
seem
to
have
got
it
on
the
canvas
where
i
wanted
it
but
you
do
she
said
you
do
get
it
there
no
he
murmured
in
return
i
never
did
i
got
out
some
of
the
old
ones
when
i
came
in
this
morning
some
that
i
had
looked
at
for
years
and
it
the
same
with
them
you
can
do
it
much
better
yourself
your
sketches
show
it
no
no
she
protested
quickly
yes
they
do
and
i
wondered
if
it
was
only
because
you
were
young
but
those
i
did
when
i
was
young
are
almost
the
same
as
the
ones
i
paint
now
i
have
learned
much
there
has
been
any
one
to
show
me
and
you
ca
learn
from
print
never
yet
i
grown
in
what
i
see
grown
so
that
the
world
is
full
of
beauty
to
me
that
i
never
dreamed
of
seeing
when
i
began
but
i
ca
paint
it
i
ca
get
it
on
the
canvas
ah
i
think
i
might
have
known
how
to
if
i
had
had
to
teach
myself
if
i
could
only
have
seen
how
some
of
the
other
fellows
did
their
work
if
i
ever
saved
money
to
get
away
from
canaan
if
i
could
have
gone
away
from
it
and
come
back
knowing
how
to
paint
it
if
i
could
have
got
to
paris
for
just
one
month
paris
for
just
one
month
perhaps
we
will
you
ca
tell
what
may
happen
it
was
always
her
reply
to
this
cry
of
his
paris
for
just
one
month
he
repeated
with
infinite
wistfulness
and
then
realizing
what
an
old
old
cry
it
was
with
him
he
shook
his
head
impatiently
sniffing
out
a
laugh
at
himself
rose
and
went
pottering
about
among
the
canvases
returning
their
faces
to
the
wall
and
railing
at
them
mutteringly
whatever
took
me
into
it
i
do
know
i
might
have
done
something
useful
but
i
could
bring
myself
ever
to
consider
doing
anything
else
i
could
bear
even
to
think
of
it
lord
forgive
me
i
even
tried
to
encourage
your
father
to
paint
perhaps
he
might
as
well
poor
boy
as
to
have
put
all
he
made
into
buying
jonas
out
ah
me
there
you
go
turn
your
silly
faces
to
the
wall
and
smile
and
cry
there
till
i
gone
and
somebody
throws
you
on
a
bonfire
never
look
at
you
again
he
paused
with
the
canvas
half
turned
and
yet
he
went
on
reflectively
a
man
promised
me
dollars
for
that
picture
once
i
painted
it
to
order
but
he
went
away
before
i
finished
it
and
never
answered
the
letters
i
wrote
him
about
it
i
wish
i
had
the
money
now
perhaps
we
could
have
more
than
two
meals
a
day
we
do
need
more
said
ariel
scraping
the
palette
attentively
it
healthier
with
only
breakfast
and
supper
i
think
i
rather
have
a
new
dress
than
dinner
i
dare
say
you
would
the
old
man
mused
you
young
you
young
what
were
you
doing
all
this
afternoon
child
in
my
room
trying
to
make
over
mamma
for
mamie
pike
invited
me
to
a
dance
at
their
house
very
well
i
glad
you
going
to
be
gay
he
said
not
seeing
the
faintly
bitter
smile
that
came
to
her
face
i
do
think
i
be
very
gay
she
answered
i
do
know
why
i
go
nobody
ever
asks
me
to
dance
why
not
he
asked
with
an
old
man
astonishment
i
do
know
perhaps
it
because
i
do
dress
very
well
then
as
he
made
a
sorrowful
gesture
she
cut
him
off
before
he
could
speak
oh
it
is
altogether
because
we
poor
it
more
i
do
know
how
to
wear
what
i
got
the
way
some
girls
do
i
never
cared
much
and
well
i
not
worrying
roger
and
i
think
i
done
a
good
deal
with
mamma
dress
it
a
very
grand
dress
i
wonder
i
never
thought
of
wearing
it
until
i
may
be
she
laughed
and
blushed
i
may
be
the
belle
of
the
ball
who
knows
you
want
me
to
walk
over
with
you
and
come
for
you
afterwards
i
expect
only
to
take
me
it
may
be
late
when
i
come
away
if
a
good
many
should
ask
me
to
dance
for
once
of
course
i
could
come
home
alone
but
joe
louden
is
going
to
sort
of
hang
around
outside
and
he
meet
me
at
the
gate
and
see
me
safe
home
oh
he
exclaimed
blankly
is
it
all
right
she
asked
i
think
i
better
come
for
you
he
answered
gently
the
truth
is
i
i
think
you
better
not
be
with
joe
louden
a
great
deal
why
well
he
does
seem
a
vicious
boy
to
me
but
i
afraid
he
getting
rather
a
bad
name
my
dear
he
not
getting
one
she
said
gravely
he
already
got
one
he
had
a
bad
name
in
canaan
for
a
long
while
it
grew
in
the
first
place
out
of
shabbiness
and
mischief
but
it
did
grow
and
if
people
keep
on
giving
him
a
bad
name
the
time
will
come
when
he
live
up
to
it
he
not
any
worse
than
i
am
and
i
guess
my
own
name
is
too
good
for
a
girl
and
yet
so
far
there
nothing
against
him
except
his
bad
name
i
afraid
there
is
said
roger
it
does
look
very
well
for
a
young
man
of
his
age
to
be
doing
no
better
than
delivering
papers
it
gives
him
time
to
study
law
she
answered
quickly
if
he
clerked
all
day
in
a
store
he
could
i
did
know
he
was
studying
now
i
thought
i
heard
that
he
was
in
a
lawyer
office
for
a
few
weeks
last
year
and
was
turned
out
for
setting
fire
to
it
with
a
pipe
it
was
an
accident
she
interposed
but
some
pretty
important
papers
were
burned
and
after
that
none
of
the
other
lawyers
would
have
him
he
not
in
an
office
she
admitted
i
did
mean
that
but
he
studies
a
great
deal
he
goes
to
the
courts
all
the
time
they
in
session
and
he
bought
some
books
of
his
own
well
perhaps
he
assented
but
they
say
he
gambles
and
drinks
and
that
last
week
judge
pike
threatened
to
have
him
arrested
for
throwing
dice
with
some
negroes
behind
the
judge
stable
what
of
it
i
about
the
only
nice
person
in
town
that
will
have
anything
to
do
with
him
and
nobody
except
you
thinks
i
very
nice
ariel
ariel
i
know
all
about
his
gambling
with
darkies
she
continued
excitedly
her
voice
rising
and
i
know
that
he
goes
to
saloons
and
that
he
an
intimate
friend
of
half
the
riffraff
in
town
and
i
know
the
reason
for
it
too
because
he
told
me
he
wants
to
know
them
to
understand
them
and
he
says
some
day
they
make
him
a
power
and
then
he
can
help
them
the
old
man
laughed
helplessly
but
i
ca
let
him
bring
you
home
my
dear
she
came
to
him
slowly
and
laid
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
grandfather
and
granddaughter
were
nearly
of
the
same
height
and
she
looked
squarely
into
his
eyes
then
you
must
say
it
is
because
you
want
to
come
for
me
not
because
i
must
come
with
joe
but
i
think
it
is
a
little
because
you
must
come
with
joe
he
answered
especially
from
the
pikes
do
you
see
that
it
be
well
for
joe
himself
if
the
judge
should
happen
to
see
him
i
understand
he
warned
the
boy
to
keep
away
from
the
neighborhood
entirely
or
he
would
have
him
locked
up
for
the
judge
is
a
very
influential
man
you
know
and
as
determined
in
matters
like
this
as
he
is
irritable
oh
if
you
put
it
on
that
ground
the
girl
replied
her
eyes
softening
i
think
you
better
come
for
me
yourself
very
well
i
put
it
on
that
ground
he
returned
smiling
upon
her
then
i
send
joe
word
and
get
supper
she
said
kissing
him
it
was
the
not
only
for
them
but
everywhere
in
canaan
and
the
cold
air
of
the
streets
bore
up
and
down
and
around
corners
the
smell
of
things
frying
the
windows
of
all
the
houses
threw
bright
patches
on
the
snow
of
the
the
windows
of
other
rooms
except
those
of
the
kitchens
were
dark
for
the
rule
of
the
place
was
puritanical
in
thrift
as
in
all
things
and
the
good
housekeepers
disputed
every
record
of
the
meters
with
unhappy
there
was
no
better
housekeeper
in
town
than
louden
nor
a
thriftier
but
hers
was
one
of
the
few
houses
in
canaan
that
evening
which
showed
bright
lights
in
the
front
rooms
while
the
family
were
at
supper
it
was
proof
of
the
agitation
caused
by
the
arrival
of
eugene
that
she
forgot
to
turn
out
the
gas
in
her
parlor
and
in
the
chamber
she
called
a
library
on
her
way
to
the
evening
meal
that
might
not
have
been
thought
a
cheerful
feast
for
joe
louden
the
fatted
calf
was
upon
the
board
but
it
had
not
been
provided
for
the
prodigal
who
in
this
case
was
the
brother
that
stayed
at
home
the
fete
rewarded
the
good
brother
who
had
been
in
strange
lands
and
the
good
one
had
found
much
honor
in
his
wanderings
as
he
carelessly
let
it
appear
louden
brightened
inexpressibly
whenever
eugene
spoke
of
himself
and
consequently
she
glowed
most
of
the
time
her
husband
a
heavy
melancholy
silent
man
with
a
grizzled
beard
and
no
mustache
lowered
at
joe
throughout
the
meal
but
appeared
to
take
a
strange
comfort
in
his
elegance
and
polish
eugene
wore
new
evening
clothes
and
was
lustrous
to
eye
and
ear
joe
escaped
as
soon
as
he
could
though
not
before
the
count
of
his
later
sins
had
been
set
before
eugene
in
detail
in
mass
and
in
all
of
their
depth
breadth
and
thickness
his
father
spoke
but
once
after
nodding
heavily
to
confirm
all
points
of
louden
recital
you
better
use
any
influence
you
got
with
your
brother
he
said
to
eugene
to
make
him
come
to
time
i
ca
do
anything
with
him
if
he
gets
in
trouble
he
need
come
to
me
i
never
help
him
again
i
tired
of
it
eugene
glanced
twinklingly
at
the
outcast
i
did
know
he
was
such
a
roarer
as
all
that
he
said
lightly
not
taking
joe
as
of
enough
consequence
to
be
treated
as
a
sinner
this
encouraged
louden
to
pathos
upon
the
subject
of
her
shame
before
other
women
when
joe
happened
to
be
mentioned
and
the
supper
was
finished
with
the
topic
joe
slipped
away
through
the
kitchen
sneakingly
and
climbed
the
back
fence
in
the
alley
he
lit
a
cheap
cigarette
and
thrusting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
shivering
violently
for
he
had
no
overcoat
walked
away
singing
to
himself
a
spanish
cavalier
stood
in
his
retreat
his
teeth
affording
an
appropriate
though
involuntary
castanet
accompaniment
his
movements
throughout
the
earlier
part
of
that
evening
are
of
uncertain
report
it
is
known
that
he
made
a
partial
payment
of
cents
at
a
for
a
number
of
volumes
grindstaff
on
torts
and
some
others
which
he
had
negotiated
on
the
instalment
system
it
is
also
believed
that
he
won
cents
playing
in
the
little
room
behind
louie
farbach
bar
but
these
things
are
of
little
import
compared
to
the
established
fact
that
at
eleven
he
was
one
of
the
ball
guests
at
the
pike
mansion
he
took
no
active
part
in
the
festivities
nor
was
he
one
of
the
dancers
his
was
on
the
contrary
the
role
of
a
quiet
observer
he
lay
stretched
at
full
length
upon
the
floor
of
the
enclosed
porch
one
of
the
strips
of
canvas
was
later
found
to
have
been
loosened
wedged
between
the
outer
railing
and
a
row
of
palms
in
green
tubs
the
position
he
occupied
was
somewhat
too
draughty
to
have
been
recommended
by
a
physician
but
he
commanded
between
the
leaves
of
the
screening
palms
an
excellent
view
of
the
room
nearest
the
porch
a
long
window
open
afforded
communication
between
this
room
one
of
those
used
for
dancing
and
the
dim
bower
which
had
been
made
of
the
veranda
whither
flirtatious
couples
made
their
way
between
the
dances
it
was
not
to
play
eavesdropper
upon
any
of
these
that
the
uninvited
joe
had
come
he
was
not
there
to
listen
and
it
is
possible
that
had
the
curtains
of
other
windows
afforded
him
the
chance
to
behold
the
dance
he
might
not
have
risked
the
dangers
of
his
present
position
he
had
not
the
slightest
interest
in
the
whispered
coquetries
that
he
heard
he
watched
only
to
catch
now
and
then
over
the
shoulders
of
the
dancers
a
fitful
glimpse
of
a
pretty
head
that
flitted
across
the
window
the
amber
hair
of
mamie
pike
he
shivered
in
the
draughts
and
the
floor
of
the
porch
was
cement
painful
to
elbow
and
knee
the
space
where
he
lay
cramped
and
narrow
but
the
golden
bubbles
of
her
hair
the
shimmer
of
her
dainty
pink
dress
and
the
fluffy
wave
of
her
lace
scarf
as
she
crossed
and
recrossed
in
a
waltz
left
him
apparently
in
no
discontent
he
watched
with
parted
lips
his
pale
cheeks
reddening
whenever
those
fair
glimpses
were
his
at
last
she
came
out
to
the
veranda
with
eugene
and
sat
upon
a
little
divan
so
close
to
joe
that
daring
wildly
in
the
shadow
he
reached
out
a
trembling
hand
and
let
his
fingers
rest
upon
the
end
of
her
scarf
which
had
fallen
from
her
shoulders
and
touched
the
floor
she
sat
with
her
back
to
him
as
did
eugene
you
have
changed
i
think
since
last
summer
he
heard
her
say
reflectively
for
the
worse
ma
cherie
joe
expression
might
have
been
worth
seeing
when
eugene
said
ma
cherie
for
it
was
known
in
the
louden
household
that
bantry
had
failed
to
pass
his
examination
in
the
french
language
no
she
answered
but
you
have
seen
so
much
and
accomplished
so
much
since
then
you
have
become
so
polished
and
so
she
paused
and
then
continued
but
perhaps
i
better
not
say
it
you
might
be
offended
no
i
want
you
to
say
it
he
returned
confidently
and
his
confidence
was
fully
justified
for
she
said
well
then
i
mean
that
you
have
become
so
thoroughly
a
man
of
the
world
now
i
said
it
you
are
offended
are
you
not
at
all
not
at
all
replied
bantry
preventing
by
a
masterful
effort
his
pleasure
from
showing
in
his
face
though
i
suppose
you
mean
to
imply
that
i
rather
wicked
oh
no
said
mamie
with
profound
admiration
not
exactly
wicked
university
life
is
fast
nowadays
eugene
admitted
it
difficult
not
to
be
drawn
into
it
and
i
suppose
you
look
down
on
poor
little
canaan
now
and
everybody
in
it
oh
no
he
laughed
indulgently
not
at
all
not
at
all
i
find
it
very
amusing
all
of
it
not
you
he
answered
becoming
very
grave
honestly
do
you
her
young
voice
trembled
a
little
honestly
indeed
truly
eugene
leaned
very
close
to
her
and
the
words
were
barely
audible
you
know
i
do
then
i
glad
she
whispered
and
joe
saw
his
touch
her
hand
but
she
rose
quickly
there
the
music
she
cried
happily
it
a
waltz
and
it
yours
joe
heard
her
little
high
heels
tapping
gayly
towards
the
window
followed
by
the
heavier
tread
of
eugene
but
he
did
not
watch
them
go
he
lay
on
his
back
with
the
hand
that
had
touched
mamie
scarf
pressed
across
his
closed
eyes
the
music
of
that
waltz
was
of
the
swingingly
sorrowful
sort
and
it
would
be
hard
to
say
how
long
it
was
after
that
before
the
boy
could
hear
the
air
played
without
a
recurrence
of
the
bitterness
of
that
moment
the
rhythmical
pathos
of
the
violins
was
in
such
accord
with
a
faint
sound
of
weeping
which
he
heard
near
him
presently
that
for
a
little
while
he
believed
this
sound
to
be
part
of
the
music
and
part
of
himself
then
it
became
more
distinct
and
he
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
to
look
about
very
close
to
him
sitting
upon
the
divan
in
the
shadow
was
a
girl
wearing
a
dress
of
beautiful
silk
she
was
crying
softly
her
face
in
her
hands
iv
the
disaster
ariel
had
worked
all
the
afternoon
over
her
mother
and
two
hours
were
required
by
her
toilet
for
the
dance
she
curled
her
hair
frizzily
burning
it
here
and
there
with
a
heated
over
a
lamp
chimney
and
she
placed
above
one
ear
three
or
four
large
artificial
roses
taken
from
an
old
hat
of
her
mother
which
she
had
found
in
a
trunk
in
the
possessing
no
slippers
she
carefully
blacked
and
polished
her
shoes
which
had
been
clumsily
resoled
and
fastened
into
the
strings
of
each
small
rosettes
of
red
ribbon
after
which
she
practised
swinging
the
train
of
her
skirt
until
she
was
proud
of
her
manipulation
of
it
she
had
no
powder
but
found
in
her
grandfather
room
a
lump
of
magnesia
that
he
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
for
and
passed
it
over
and
over
her
brown
face
and
hands
then
a
lingering
gaze
into
her
small
mirror
gave
her
joy
at
last
she
yearned
so
hard
to
see
herself
charming
that
she
did
see
herself
so
admiration
came
and
she
told
herself
that
she
was
more
attractive
to
look
at
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
and
that
perhaps
at
last
she
might
begin
to
be
sought
for
like
other
girls
the
little
glass
showed
a
sort
of
prettiness
in
her
thin
unmatured
young
face
tripping
ran
through
her
head
her
feet
keeping
the
time
ah
she
did
so
hope
to
dance
often
that
night
perhaps
perhaps
she
might
be
asked
for
every
number
and
so
wrapping
an
old
waterproof
cloak
about
her
she
took
her
grandfather
arm
and
sallied
forth
high
hopes
in
her
beating
heart
it
was
in
the
that
the
change
began
to
come
alone
at
home
in
her
own
ugly
little
room
she
had
thought
herself
almost
beautiful
but
here
in
the
brightly
lighted
chamber
crowded
with
the
other
girls
it
was
different
there
was
a
big
at
one
end
of
the
room
and
she
faced
it
when
her
turn
came
for
the
mirror
was
popular
with
a
sinking
spirit
there
was
the
contrast
like
a
picture
painted
and
framed
the
other
girls
all
wore
their
hair
after
the
fashion
introduced
to
canaan
by
mamie
pike
the
week
before
on
her
return
from
a
visit
to
chicago
none
of
them
had
crimped
and
none
had
bedecked
their
tresses
with
artificial
flowers
her
alterations
of
the
had
not
been
successful
the
skirt
was
too
short
in
front
and
higher
on
one
side
than
on
the
other
showing
too
plainly
the
shoes
which
had
lost
most
of
their
polish
in
the
walk
through
the
snow
the
ribbon
rosettes
were
fully
revealed
and
as
she
glanced
at
their
reflection
she
heard
the
words
look
at
that
train
and
those
rosettes
whispered
behind
her
and
saw
in
the
mirror
two
pretty
young
women
turn
away
with
their
handkerchiefs
over
their
mouths
and
retreat
hurriedly
to
an
alcove
all
the
feet
in
the
room
except
ariel
were
in
dainty
kid
or
satin
slippers
of
the
color
of
the
dresses
from
which
they
glimmered
out
and
only
ariel
wore
a
train
she
went
away
from
the
mirror
and
pretended
to
be
busy
with
a
hanging
thread
in
her
sleeve
she
was
singularly
an
alien
in
the
chattering
room
although
she
had
been
born
and
lived
all
her
life
in
the
town
perhaps
her
position
among
the
young
ladies
may
be
best
defined
by
the
remark
generally
current
among
them
that
evening
to
the
effect
that
it
was
very
sweet
of
mamie
to
invite
her
ariel
was
not
like
the
others
she
was
not
of
them
and
never
had
been
indeed
she
did
not
know
them
very
well
some
of
them
nodded
to
her
and
gave
her
a
word
of
greeting
pleasantly
all
of
them
whispered
about
her
with
wonder
and
suppressed
amusement
but
none
talked
to
her
they
were
not
unkindly
but
they
were
young
and
eager
and
excited
over
their
own
interests
which
were
then
in
the
gentlemen
each
of
the
other
girls
had
been
escorted
by
a
youth
of
the
place
and
one
by
one
joining
these
escorts
in
the
hall
outside
the
door
they
descended
the
stairs
until
only
ariel
was
left
she
came
down
alone
after
the
first
dance
had
begun
and
greeted
her
young
hostess
mother
timidly
pike
a
small
woman
with
a
prominent
ruby
necklace
answered
her
absently
and
hurried
away
to
see
that
the
imported
waiters
did
not
steal
anything
ariel
sat
in
one
of
the
chairs
against
the
wall
and
watched
the
dancers
with
a
smile
of
eager
and
benevolent
interest
in
canaan
no
parents
no
guardians
nor
aunts
were
haled
forth
o
nights
to
duenna
the
junketings
of
youth
pike
did
not
reappear
and
ariel
sat
conspicuously
alone
there
was
nothing
else
for
her
to
do
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
when
the
first
dance
reached
an
end
mamie
pike
came
to
her
for
a
moment
with
a
cheery
welcome
and
was
immediately
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
young
men
and
women
flushed
with
dancing
shouting
as
was
their
wont
laughing
inexplicably
over
words
and
phrases
and
unintelligible
as
if
they
all
belonged
to
a
secret
society
and
these
cries
were
symbols
of
things
exquisitely
humorous
which
only
they
understood
ariel
laughed
with
them
more
heartily
than
any
other
so
that
she
might
seem
to
be
of
them
and
as
merry
as
they
were
but
almost
immediately
she
found
herself
outside
of
the
circle
and
presently
they
all
whirled
away
into
another
dance
and
she
was
left
alone
again
so
she
sat
no
one
coming
near
her
through
several
dances
trying
to
maintain
the
smile
of
delighted
interest
upon
her
face
though
she
felt
the
muscles
of
her
face
beginning
to
ache
with
their
fixedness
her
eyes
growing
hot
and
glazed
all
the
other
girls
were
provided
with
partners
for
every
dance
with
several
young
men
left
over
these
latter
lounging
hilariously
together
in
the
doorways
ariel
was
careful
not
to
glance
towards
them
but
she
could
not
help
hating
them
once
or
twice
between
the
dances
she
saw
miss
pike
speak
appealingly
to
one
of
the
superfluous
glancing
at
the
same
time
in
her
own
direction
and
ariel
could
see
too
that
the
appeal
proved
unsuccessful
until
at
last
mamie
approached
her
leading
norbert
flitcroft
partly
by
the
hand
partly
by
norbert
was
an
excessively
fat
boy
and
at
the
present
moment
looked
as
patient
as
the
blind
but
he
asked
ariel
if
she
was
engaged
for
the
next
dance
and
mamie
having
flitted
away
stood
disconsolately
beside
her
waiting
for
the
music
to
begin
ariel
was
grateful
for
him
i
think
you
must
be
very
flitcroft
she
said
with
an
air
of
raillery
no
i
not
he
replied
plaintively
everybody
thinks
i
am
because
i
fat
and
they
expect
me
to
do
things
they
never
dream
of
asking
anybody
else
to
do
i
like
to
see
even
ask
bantry
to
go
and
do
some
of
the
things
they
get
me
to
do
a
person
just
because
he
fat
he
concluded
morbidly
but
he
might
as
well
be
oh
i
meant
she
returned
with
a
sprightly
laugh
because
you
willing
to
waltz
with
me
oh
well
he
returned
sighing
that
all
right
the
orchestra
flourished
into
la
paloma
he
put
his
arm
mournfully
about
her
and
taking
her
right
hand
with
his
left
carried
her
arm
out
to
a
rigid
right
angle
beginning
to
pump
and
balance
for
time
they
made
three
false
starts
and
then
got
away
ariel
danced
badly
she
hopped
and
lost
the
step
but
they
persevered
bumping
against
other
couples
continually
circling
breathlessly
into
the
next
room
they
passed
close
to
a
long
mirror
in
which
ariel
saw
herself
although
in
a
flash
more
bitterly
contrasted
to
the
others
than
in
the
of
the
the
clump
of
roses
was
flopping
about
her
neck
her
crimped
hair
looked
frowzy
and
there
was
something
terribly
wrong
about
her
dress
suddenly
she
felt
her
train
to
be
ominously
grotesque
as
a
thing
following
her
in
a
nightmare
a
moment
later
she
caught
her
partner
making
a
burlesque
face
of
suffering
over
her
shoulder
and
turning
her
head
quickly
saw
for
whose
benefit
he
had
constructed
it
eugene
bantry
flying
expertly
by
with
mamie
was
bestowing
upon
flitcroft
a
condescendingly
commiserative
wink
the
next
instant
she
tripped
in
her
train
and
fell
to
the
floor
at
eugene
feet
carrying
her
partner
with
her
there
was
a
shout
of
laughter
the
young
hostess
stopped
eugene
who
would
have
gone
on
and
he
had
no
choice
but
to
stoop
to
assistance
it
seems
to
be
a
habit
of
mine
she
said
laughing
loudly
she
did
not
appear
to
see
the
hand
he
offered
but
got
to
her
feet
without
help
and
walked
quickly
away
with
norbert
who
proceeded
to
live
up
to
the
character
he
had
given
himself
perhaps
we
had
better
not
try
it
again
she
laughed
well
i
should
think
not
he
returned
with
the
frankest
gloom
with
the
air
of
conducting
her
home
he
took
her
to
the
chair
against
the
wall
whence
he
had
brought
her
there
his
responsibility
for
her
seemed
to
cease
will
you
excuse
me
he
asked
and
there
was
no
doubt
that
he
felt
that
he
had
been
given
more
than
his
share
that
evening
even
though
he
was
fat
yes
indeed
her
laughter
was
continuous
i
should
think
you
would
be
glad
to
get
rid
of
me
after
that
ha
ha
ha
poor
flitcroft
you
know
you
are
it
was
the
deadly
truth
and
the
fat
one
saying
well
if
you
just
excuse
me
now
hurried
away
with
a
step
which
grew
lighter
as
the
distance
from
her
increased
arrived
at
the
haven
of
a
far
doorway
he
mopped
his
brow
and
shook
his
head
grimly
in
response
to
frequent
rallyings
ariel
sat
through
more
dances
interminable
dances
and
intermissions
in
that
same
chair
in
which
it
began
to
seem
she
was
to
live
out
the
rest
of
her
life
now
and
then
if
she
thought
people
were
looking
at
her
as
they
passed
she
broke
into
a
laugh
and
nodded
slightly
as
if
still
amused
over
her
mishap
after
a
long
time
she
rose
and
laughing
cheerfully
to
flitcroft
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
and
replied
with
a
wan
smile
stepped
out
quickly
into
the
hall
where
she
almost
ran
into
her
jonas
tabor
he
was
going
towards
the
big
front
doors
with
judge
pike
having
just
come
out
of
the
latter
library
down
the
hall
jonas
was
breathing
heavily
and
was
shockingly
pale
though
his
eyes
were
very
bright
he
turned
his
back
upon
his
grandniece
sharply
and
went
out
of
the
door
ariel
turned
from
him
quite
as
abruptly
and
the
room
whence
she
had
come
she
laughed
again
to
her
fat
friend
as
she
passed
him
and
still
laughing
went
towards
the
fatal
chair
when
her
eyes
caught
sight
of
eugene
bantry
and
mamie
coming
in
through
the
window
from
the
porch
still
laughing
she
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
the
porch
seemed
deserted
and
was
faintly
illuminated
by
a
few
japanese
lanterns
she
sprang
out
dropped
upon
the
divan
and
burying
her
face
in
her
hands
cried
presently
she
felt
something
alive
touch
her
foot
and
her
breath
catching
with
alarm
she
started
to
rise
a
thin
hand
issuing
from
a
shabby
sleeve
had
stolen
out
between
two
of
the
green
tubs
and
was
pressing
upon
one
of
her
shoes
said
joe
do
make
a
noise
his
warning
was
not
needed
she
had
recognized
the
hand
and
sleeve
instantly
she
dropped
back
with
a
low
sound
which
would
have
been
hysterical
if
it
had
been
louder
while
he
raised
himself
on
his
arm
until
she
could
see
his
face
dimly
as
he
peered
at
her
between
the
palms
what
were
you
going
on
about
he
asked
angrily
nothing
she
answered
i
was
you
must
go
away
and
quick
it
too
dangerous
if
the
judge
found
you
he
wo
ah
you
risk
anything
to
see
mamie
pike
what
were
you
crying
about
he
interrupted
nothing
i
tell
you
she
repeated
the
tears
not
ceasing
to
gather
in
her
eyes
i
was
i
want
to
know
what
it
was
he
insisted
did
the
fools
ask
you
to
dance
ah
you
need
tell
me
that
it
i
been
here
for
the
last
three
dances
and
you
were
in
sight
till
you
came
to
the
window
well
what
do
you
care
about
that
for
i
do
she
answered
i
do
then
suddenly
without
being
able
to
prevent
it
she
sobbed
no
he
said
gently
i
see
you
do
and
you
let
yourself
be
a
fool
because
there
are
a
lot
of
fools
in
there
she
gave
way
all
at
once
to
a
gust
of
sorrow
and
bitterness
she
bent
far
over
and
caught
his
hand
and
laid
it
against
her
wet
cheek
oh
joe
she
whispered
brokenly
i
think
we
have
such
hard
lives
you
and
i
it
does
seem
right
while
we
so
young
why
ca
we
be
like
the
others
why
ca
we
have
some
of
the
fun
he
withdrew
his
hand
with
the
embarrassment
and
shame
he
would
have
felt
had
she
been
a
boy
get
out
he
said
feebly
she
did
not
seem
to
notice
but
still
stooping
rested
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
her
face
in
her
hands
i
try
so
hard
to
have
fun
to
be
like
the
rest
and
it
always
a
mistake
always
always
always
she
rocked
herself
slightly
from
side
to
side
i
am
a
fool
the
truth
or
i
would
have
come
i
want
to
be
attractive
i
want
to
be
in
things
i
want
to
laugh
like
they
do
to
laugh
just
to
laugh
and
not
because
there
something
funny
yes
i
do
i
do
and
to
know
how
to
dress
and
to
wear
my
hair
there
must
be
some
place
where
you
can
learn
those
things
i
never
had
any
one
to
show
me
ah
grandfather
said
something
like
that
this
afternoon
poor
man
we
in
the
same
case
if
we
only
had
some
one
to
show
us
it
all
seems
so
blind
here
in
canaan
for
him
and
me
i
do
say
it
not
my
own
fault
as
much
as
being
poor
i
been
a
hoyden
i
do
feel
as
if
i
learned
how
to
be
a
girl
yet
joe
only
lately
i
cared
but
i
seventeen
joe
and
and
i
was
sent
home
and
she
faltered
came
to
a
stop
and
her
whole
body
was
shaken
with
sobs
i
hate
myself
so
for
crying
for
everything
i
tell
you
something
he
whispered
chuckling
desperately
made
me
unpack
his
trunk
and
i
do
believe
he
as
great
a
man
at
college
as
he
is
here
i
opened
one
of
his
books
and
some
one
had
written
in
it
bantry
the
class
he
never
noticed
and
you
ought
to
have
heard
him
go
on
you
have
just
died
ariel
i
almost
bust
wide
open
it
was
a
mean
trick
in
me
but
i
could
help
showing
it
to
him
joe
object
was
obtained
she
stopped
crying
and
wiping
her
eyes
smiled
faintly
then
she
became
grave
you
jealous
of
eugene
she
said
he
considered
this
for
a
moment
yes
he
answered
thoughtfully
i
am
but
i
would
think
about
him
differently
on
that
account
and
i
would
talk
about
him
to
any
one
but
you
not
even
to
she
left
the
question
unfinished
no
he
said
quietly
of
course
not
no
because
it
would
be
any
use
i
do
know
i
never
have
a
chance
to
talk
to
her
anyway
of
course
you
do
her
voice
had
grown
steady
you
say
i
a
fool
what
are
you
you
need
worry
about
me
he
began
i
can
take
care
she
whispered
warningly
the
music
had
stopped
a
loud
clatter
of
voices
and
laughter
succeeding
it
what
need
to
be
careful
joe
assured
her
with
all
that
noise
going
on
you
must
go
away
she
said
anxiously
oh
please
joe
not
yet
i
want
she
coughed
loudly
eugene
and
mamie
pike
had
come
to
the
window
with
the
evident
intention
of
occupying
the
veranda
but
perceiving
ariel
engaged
with
threads
in
her
sleeve
they
turned
away
and
disappeared
other
couples
looked
out
from
time
to
time
and
finding
the
solitary
figure
in
possession
retreated
abruptly
to
seek
stairways
and
remote
corners
for
the
things
they
were
impelled
to
say
and
so
ariel
held
the
porch
for
three
dances
and
three
intermissions
occupying
a
great
part
of
the
time
with
entreaties
that
her
obdurate
and
reckless
companion
should
go
when
for
the
fourth
time
the
music
sounded
her
agitation
had
so
increased
that
she
was
visibly
trembling
i
ca
stand
it
joe
she
said
bending
over
him
i
do
know
what
would
happen
if
they
found
you
you
got
to
go
no
i
have
he
chuckled
they
have
even
distributed
the
supper
yet
and
you
take
all
the
chances
she
said
slowly
just
to
see
her
pass
that
window
a
few
times
what
chances
of
what
the
judge
will
do
if
any
one
sees
you
nothing
because
if
any
one
saw
me
i
leave
please
go
not
till
a
colored
waiter
smiling
graciously
came
out
upon
the
porch
bearing
a
tray
of
salad
hot
oysters
and
coffee
ariel
shook
her
head
i
do
want
any
she
murmured
the
waiter
turned
away
in
pity
and
was
the
window
when
a
passionate
whisper
fell
upon
his
ear
as
well
as
upon
ariel
take
it
said
the
waiter
i
changed
my
mind
she
replied
quickly
the
waiter
his
elation
restored
gave
of
his
viands
with
the
superfluous
bounty
loved
by
his
race
when
distributing
the
product
of
the
wealthy
when
he
had
gone
give
me
everything
that
hot
said
joe
you
can
keep
the
salad
i
could
eat
it
or
anything
else
she
answered
thrusting
the
plate
between
the
palms
for
a
time
there
was
silence
from
within
the
house
came
the
continuous
babble
of
voices
and
laughter
the
clink
of
cutlery
on
china
the
young
people
spent
a
long
time
over
their
supper
the
waiter
returned
to
the
veranda
deposited
a
plate
of
colored
ices
upon
ariel
knees
with
a
noble
gesture
and
departed
no
ice
for
me
said
joe
wo
you
please
go
now
she
entreated
it
would
be
good
manners
he
responded
they
might
think
i
only
came
for
supper
hand
me
back
the
things
the
waiter
might
come
for
them
any
minute
not
yet
i
have
quite
finished
i
eat
with
contemplation
ariel
because
there
more
than
the
mere
food
and
the
warmth
of
it
to
consider
there
the
pleasure
of
being
entertained
by
the
great
martin
pike
think
what
a
real
kindness
i
doing
him
too
i
increase
his
good
deeds
and
his
hospitality
without
his
knowing
it
or
being
able
to
help
it
do
you
see
how
i
boost
his
standing
with
the
recording
angel
if
lazarus
had
behaved
the
way
i
do
dives
need
have
had
those
worries
that
came
to
him
in
the
give
me
the
dish
and
she
whispered
impatiently
suppose
the
waiter
came
and
had
to
look
for
them
quick
take
them
then
you
see
that
jealousy
has
spoiled
my
appetite
a
figure
appeared
in
the
window
and
she
had
no
time
to
take
the
plate
and
cup
which
were
being
pushed
through
the
she
whispered
a
syllable
of
warning
and
the
dishes
were
hurriedly
withdrawn
as
norbert
flitcroft
wearing
a
solemn
expression
of
injury
came
out
upon
the
veranda
he
halted
suddenly
what
that
he
asked
with
suspicion
nothing
answered
ariel
sharply
where
behind
those
palms
probably
your
own
shadow
she
laughed
or
it
might
have
been
a
draught
moving
the
leaves
he
did
not
seem
satisfied
but
stared
hard
at
the
spot
where
the
dishes
had
disappeared
meantime
edging
back
cautiously
nearer
the
window
they
want
you
he
said
after
a
pause
some
one
come
for
you
oh
is
grandfather
waiting
she
rose
at
the
same
time
letting
her
handkerchief
fall
she
stooped
to
pick
it
up
with
her
face
away
from
norbert
and
towards
the
palms
whispering
tremulously
but
with
passionate
urgency
please
go
it
is
your
grandfather
that
has
come
for
you
said
the
fat
one
slowly
it
is
old
eskew
arp
something
happened
she
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
beginning
to
tremble
violently
her
eyes
growing
wide
with
fright
is
my
grandfather
is
he
sick
you
better
go
and
see
old
eskew
waiting
in
the
hall
he
tell
you
she
was
by
him
and
through
the
window
instantly
norbert
did
not
follow
her
he
remained
for
several
moments
looking
earnestly
at
the
palms
then
he
stepped
through
the
window
and
beckoned
to
a
youth
who
was
lounging
in
the
doorway
across
the
room
there
somebody
hiding
behind
those
plants
he
whispered
when
his
friend
reached
him
go
and
tell
judge
pike
to
send
some
of
the
niggers
to
watch
outside
the
porch
so
that
he
does
get
away
then
tell
him
to
get
his
revolver
and
come
here
meanwhile
ariel
had
found
arp
waiting
in
the
hall
talking
in
a
low
voice
to
pike
your
grandfather
all
right
he
told
the
frightened
girl
quickly
he
sent
me
for
you
that
all
just
hurry
and
get
your
things
she
was
with
him
again
in
a
moment
and
seizing
the
old
man
arm
hurried
him
down
the
steps
and
toward
the
street
almost
at
a
run
you
not
telling
me
the
truth
she
said
you
not
telling
me
the
truth
nothing
has
happened
to
roger
panted
arp
nothing
to
mind
i
mean
here
we
going
this
way
not
that
they
had
come
to
the
gate
and
as
she
turned
to
the
right
he
pulled
her
round
sharply
to
the
left
we
not
going
to
your
house
where
are
we
going
we
going
to
your
uncle
jonas
why
she
cried
in
supreme
astonishment
what
do
you
want
to
take
me
there
for
do
you
know
that
he
stopped
speaking
to
me
yes
said
the
old
man
grimly
with
something
of
the
look
he
wore
when
delivering
a
clincher
at
the
national
house
he
stopped
speaking
to
everybody
v
beaver
beach
the
canaan
daily
tocsin
of
the
following
morning
ventured
the
assertion
upon
its
front
page
that
the
scene
at
the
pike
mansion
was
one
of
unalloyed
festivity
music
and
mirth
a
fairy
bower
of
airy
figures
wafting
here
and
there
to
the
throb
of
a
veritable
temple
of
terpsichore
shining
forth
with
a
myriad
of
lights
which
together
with
the
generous
profusion
of
floral
decorations
and
the
mingled
delights
afforded
by
minds
orchestra
of
indianapolis
and
caterer
jones
of
chicago
was
in
all
likelihood
never
heretofore
surpassed
in
elegance
in
our
city
only
one
incident
the
tocsin
remarked
marred
an
otherwise
perfect
occasion
and
out
of
regard
for
the
culprit
family
connections
which
are
prominent
in
our
social
world
we
withhold
his
name
suffice
it
to
say
that
through
the
vigilance
of
norbert
flitcroft
grandson
of
colonel
a
flitcroft
who
proved
himself
a
thorough
lecoq
the
celebrated
french
detective
the
rascal
was
seized
and
recognized
flitcroft
having
discovered
him
in
hiding
had
a
cordon
of
waiters
drawn
up
around
his
which
was
the
charmingly
decorated
side
piazza
of
the
pike
mansion
and
sent
for
judge
pike
who
came
upon
the
intruder
by
surprise
he
evaded
the
judge
indignant
grasp
but
received
a
blow
over
the
head
from
a
poker
which
the
judge
had
concealed
about
his
person
while
pretending
to
approach
the
casually
attracted
to
the
scene
by
the
cries
of
flitcroft
who
standing
behind
judge
pike
accidentally
received
a
blow
from
the
same
weapon
all
the
guests
of
the
evening
sprang
to
view
the
scene
only
to
behold
the
culprit
leap
through
a
crevice
between
the
strips
of
canvas
which
enclosed
the
piazza
he
was
seized
by
the
colored
coachman
of
the
mansion
sam
warden
and
immediately
pounced
upon
by
the
cordon
of
caterer
jones
dusky
assistants
from
chicago
who
were
in
ambush
outside
unfortunately
after
a
brief
struggle
he
managed
to
trip
warden
and
the
others
stumbling
upon
the
prostrate
body
of
the
latter
to
make
his
escape
in
the
darkness
it
is
not
believed
by
many
that
his
intention
was
burglary
though
what
his
designs
were
can
only
be
left
to
conjecture
as
he
is
far
beyond
the
age
when
boys
perform
such
actions
out
of
a
sense
of
mischief
he
had
evidently
occupied
his
some
time
and
an
idea
of
his
coolness
may
be
obtained
from
his
having
procured
and
eaten
a
full
meal
through
an
unknown
source
judge
pike
is
justly
incensed
and
swears
that
he
will
prosecute
him
on
this
and
other
charges
as
soon
as
he
can
be
found
much
sympathy
is
felt
for
the
culprit
family
who
feel
his
shame
most
keenly
but
who
though
sorrowing
over
the
occurrence
declare
that
they
have
put
up
with
his
derelictions
long
enough
and
will
do
nothing
to
step
between
him
and
the
righteous
indignation
the
pike
mansion
scene
of
festivity
music
and
mirth
not
quite
so
unalloyed
after
all
the
stricken
flitcroft
keeping
his
room
for
a
week
under
medical
supervision
had
not
been
the
only
bower
of
the
dance
in
canaan
that
evening
another
temple
of
terpsichore
had
shone
forth
with
lights
though
of
these
there
were
not
quite
a
myriad
the
festivities
they
illumined
obtained
no
mention
in
the
paper
nor
did
they
who
trod
the
measures
in
this
second
temple
exhibit
any
sense
of
injury
because
of
the
tocsin
omission
nay
they
were
of
that
class
shy
without
being
bashful
exclusive
yet
not
proud
which
shuns
publicity
with
a
almost
unique
in
our
republic
courting
observation
neither
in
the
prosecution
of
their
professions
nor
in
the
pursuit
of
happiness
not
quite
a
mile
above
the
northernmost
of
the
factories
on
the
there
projected
into
the
river
near
the
end
of
the
crescent
bend
above
the
town
a
long
pier
relic
of
steamboat
days
rotting
now
and
many
years
fallen
from
its
maritime
uses
about
midway
of
its
length
stood
a
huge
crazy
shed
long
ago
utilized
as
a
freight
storeroom
this
had
been
patched
and
propped
and
a
veranda
attached
to
it
the
water
above
the
doorway
was
placed
a
sign
whereon
might
be
read
the
words
beaver
beach
mike
place
the
shore
end
of
the
pier
was
so
ruinous
that
passage
was
offered
by
a
single
row
of
planks
which
presented
an
appearance
so
temporary
as
well
as
insecure
that
one
might
have
guessed
their
office
to
be
something
in
the
nature
of
a
drawbridge
from
these
a
narrow
path
ran
through
a
marsh
left
by
the
receding
river
to
a
country
road
of
desolate
appearance
here
there
was
a
rough
enclosure
or
corral
with
some
sheds
which
afforded
shelter
on
the
night
of
joseph
louden
disgrace
for
a
number
of
shaggy
teams
attached
to
those
decrepit
and
musty
vehicles
known
picturesquely
and
accurately
as
the
presence
of
such
questionable
shapes
in
the
corral
indicated
that
the
dance
was
on
at
beaver
beach
mike
place
as
surely
as
the
short
line
of
cabs
and
family
carriages
on
upper
main
street
made
it
known
that
gayety
was
the
order
of
the
night
at
the
pike
mansion
but
among
other
differences
was
this
that
at
the
hour
when
the
guests
of
the
latter
were
leaving
those
seeking
the
hospitalities
of
beaver
beach
had
just
begun
to
arrive
by
three
however
joy
at
mike
place
had
become
beyond
question
unconfined
and
the
tokens
of
it
were
audible
for
a
long
distance
in
all
directions
if
however
there
is
no
sound
where
no
ear
hears
silence
rested
upon
the
until
an
hour
later
then
a
lonely
figure
came
shivering
from
the
direction
of
the
town
not
by
the
road
but
slinking
through
the
snow
upon
the
frozen
river
it
came
slowly
as
though
very
tired
and
cautiously
too
often
turning
its
head
to
look
behind
finally
it
reached
the
pier
and
stopped
as
if
to
listen
within
the
house
above
a
piano
of
evil
life
was
being
beaten
to
death
for
its
sins
and
clamoring
its
last
cries
horribly
the
old
shed
rattled
in
every
part
with
the
thud
of
many
heavy
feet
and
trembled
with
the
shock
of
noise
an
incessant
roar
of
men
voices
punctuated
with
women
screams
then
the
riot
quieted
somewhat
there
was
a
clapping
of
hands
and
a
violin
began
to
squeak
measures
intended
to
be
oriental
the
next
moment
the
listener
scrambled
up
one
of
the
rotting
piles
and
stood
upon
the
veranda
a
shaft
of
red
light
through
a
broken
shutter
struck
across
the
figure
above
the
shoulders
revealing
a
bloody
handkerchief
clumsily
knotted
about
the
head
and
beneath
it
the
face
of
joe
louden
he
went
to
the
broken
shutter
and
looked
in
around
the
blackened
walls
of
the
room
stood
a
bleared
mob
applausively
watching
through
a
fog
of
smoke
the
contortions
of
an
old
woman
in
a
red
calico
wrapper
who
was
dancing
in
the
centre
of
the
floor
the
fiddler
a
rubicund
person
evidently
not
suffering
from
any
great
depression
of
spirit
through
the
circumstance
of
being
out
on
bail
as
he
was
to
joe
intimate
knowledge
sat
astride
a
barrel
resting
his
instrument
upon
the
foamy
tap
thereof
and
playing
somewhat
after
the
manner
of
a
in
no
wise
incommoded
by
the
fact
that
a
tall
man
known
to
a
few
friends
as
an
expert
in
the
line
was
sleeping
on
his
shoulder
while
another
gentleman
who
had
prevented
many
cases
of
typhoid
by
removing
old
plumbing
from
houses
lay
on
the
floor
at
the
feet
and
endeavored
to
assist
him
by
plucking
the
strings
of
the
fiddle
joe
opened
the
door
and
went
in
all
of
the
merry
company
who
were
able
turned
sharply
toward
the
door
as
it
opened
then
recognizing
the
turned
again
to
watch
the
old
woman
one
or
two
nearest
the
door
asked
the
boy
without
great
curiosity
what
had
happened
to
his
head
he
merely
shook
it
faintly
in
reply
and
crossed
the
room
to
an
open
hallway
beyond
at
the
end
of
this
he
came
to
a
frowzy
bedroom
the
door
of
which
stood
ajar
seated
at
a
deal
table
and
working
by
a
dim
lamp
with
a
broken
chimney
a
man
in
his
was
jabbing
gloomily
at
a
column
of
figures
scrawled
in
a
dirty
ledger
he
looked
up
as
joe
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
his
eyes
showed
a
slight
surprise
i
never
thought
ye
had
the
temper
to
git
somebody
to
split
yer
head
said
he
where
ye
collect
it
nowhere
joe
answered
dropping
weakly
on
the
bed
it
amount
to
anything
well
i
take
just
a
look
fer
myself
said
the
man
rising
and
i
no
objection
to
not
knowin
how
ye
come
by
it
ye
always
been
the
great
one
fer
keepin
yer
mysteries
to
yerself
he
unwound
the
handkerchief
and
removed
it
from
joe
head
gently
whee
he
cried
as
a
long
gash
was
exposed
over
the
forehead
i
hope
ye
left
a
mark
somewhere
to
pay
a
little
on
the
score
o
this
joe
chuckled
and
dropped
dizzily
back
upon
the
pillow
there
was
another
who
got
something
like
it
he
gasped
feebly
and
oh
mike
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
him
going
on
perhaps
you
did
it
was
only
three
miles
from
here
nothing
i
liked
better
said
the
other
bringing
a
basin
of
clear
water
from
a
stand
in
the
corner
it
a
beautiful
thing
to
hear
a
man
holler
when
he
gits
a
grand
one
like
ye
wearing
he
bathed
the
wound
gently
and
hurrying
from
the
room
returned
immediately
with
a
small
jug
of
vinegar
wetting
a
rag
with
this
tender
fluid
he
applied
it
to
joe
head
speaking
soothingly
the
while
nothing
in
the
world
like
a
bit
o
good
cider
vinegar
to
keep
off
the
festerin
it
may
seem
a
trifle
scratchy
fer
the
moment
but
it
assassinates
the
there
ye
go
it
the
fine
thing
fer
ye
joe
what
are
ye
squirmin
about
i
only
enjoying
it
the
boy
answered
writhing
as
the
vinegar
worked
into
the
gash
do
you
mind
my
laughing
to
myself
ye
a
good
one
joe
said
the
other
continuing
his
ministrations
i
wisht
after
all
ye
felt
like
makin
me
known
to
what
the
trouble
there
some
of
us
would
be
glad
to
take
it
up
fer
ye
and
no
no
it
all
right
i
was
somewhere
i
had
no
business
to
be
and
i
got
caught
who
caught
ye
first
some
nice
white
people
joe
smiled
his
distorted
smile
and
then
a
black
man
helped
me
to
get
away
as
soon
as
he
saw
who
it
was
he
a
friend
of
mine
and
he
fell
down
and
tripped
up
the
pursuit
i
always
knew
ye
git
into
large
trouble
some
day
the
man
tore
a
strip
from
an
old
towel
and
began
to
bandage
the
boy
head
with
an
accustomed
hand
yer
taste
fer
excitement
has
been
growin
on
ye
every
minute
of
the
four
years
i
known
ye
excitement
echoed
joe
painfully
blinking
at
his
friend
do
you
think
i
hunting
excitement
be
hanged
to
ye
said
the
man
ca
i
say
a
teasing
word
without
gittin
called
to
order
fer
it
i
know
ye
my
boy
as
well
as
ye
know
yerself
ye
a
queer
one
ye
one
of
the
few
that
must
know
all
sides
of
the
world
and
ca
content
themselves
with
bein
respectable
ye
have
sunk
to
life
because
ye
low
yourself
but
ye
never
git
a
damned
one
o
the
respectable
to
believe
it
there
a
few
others
like
ye
in
the
wide
world
and
seen
one
or
two
of
i
been
all
over
sailorman

pedler
and
in
the
i

the
grand
national

paris
and

the
few
kinds
of
women
there
is
on
earth
and
the
many
kinds
of
men

own
kind

the
one
i
seen
the
fewest
of
but
i
knew
ye
belonged
to
it
the
first
time
i
laid
eyes
on
ye
he
paused
then
continued
with
conviction
ye
come
to
no
good
either
fer
yerself
yet
no
one
can
say
ye
have
the
talents
ye
helped
many
of
the
boys
out
of
a
bad
hole
with
a
word
of
advice
around
the
courts
and
the
jail
who
knows
but
ye
be
a
great
lawyer
if
ye
kept
on
young
people
usually
like
to
discuss
themselves
under
any
conditions
hence
the
rewards
of
palmistry
but
joe
comment
on
this
harangue
was
not
so
responsive
as
might
have
been
expected
i
got
seven
dollars
he
said
and
i
leave
the
clothes
i
got
on
can
you
fix
me
up
with
something
different
aha
cried
the
man
then

are
in
trouble
i
thought

to
ye
some
day
have
ye
been
dinnymitin
martin
pike
see
what
you
can
do
said
joe
i
want
to
wait
here
until
daybreak
lie
down
then
interrupted
the
other
and
fergit
the
hullabaloo
in
the
beyond
i
can
easily
do
that
joe
stretched
himself
upon
the
bed
i
got
so
many
other
things
to
remember
i
have
the
things
fer
ye
and
i
let
ye
know
i
have
no
use
fer
seven
dollars
returned
the
man
crossly
what
are
ye
sniffin
fer
i
thinking
of
the
poor
fellow
that
got
the
mate
to
this
said
joe
touching
the
bandage
i
ca
help
crying
when
i
think
they
may
have
used
vinegar
on
his
head
too
git
to
sleep
if
ye
can
exclaimed
the
samaritan
as
a
hideous
burst
of
noise
came
from
the
where
some
one
seemed
to
be
breaking
a
chair
upon
an
acquaintance
i
go
out
and
regulate
the
boys
a
bit
he
turned
down
the
lamp
fumbled
in
his
and
went
to
the
door
do
forget
joe
called
after
him
go
to
sleep
said
the
man
his
hand
on
the
that
is
go
to
thinkin
fer
ye
wo
sleep
ye
not
the
kind
but
think
easy
i
have
the
things
fer
ye
it
a
matter
of
pride
with
me
that
i
always
knew
ye
come
to
trouble
vi
ye
tak
the
high
road
and
i
tak
the
low
road
the
day
broke
with
a
scream
of
wind
out
of
the
prairies
and
such
cloudbursts
of
snow
that
joe
could
see
neither
bank
of
the
river
as
he
made
his
way
down
the
big
bend
of
ice
the
wind
struck
so
bitterly
that
now
and
then
he
stopped
and
panting
and
gasping
leaned
his
weight
against
it
the
snow
on
the
ground
was
caught
up
and
flew
like
sea
spume
in
a
hurricane
it
swirled
about
him
joining
the
flakes
in
the
air
so
that
it
seemed
to
be
snowing
from
the
ground
upward
as
much
as
from
the
sky
downward
fierce
as
it
was
hard
as
it
was
to
fight
through
snow
from
the
earth
snow
from
the
sky
joe
was
grateful
for
it
feeling
that
it
veiled
him
making
him
safer
though
he
trusted
somewhat
the
change
of
costume
he
had
effected
at
beaver
beach
a
rough
workman
cap
was
pulled
down
over
his
ears
and
eyebrows
a
knitted
comforter
was
wound
about
the
lower
part
of
his
face
under
a
ragged
overcoat
he
wore
blue
overalls
and
rubber
boots
and
in
one
of
his
hands
he
swung
a
tin
when
he
reached
the
nearest
of
the
factories
he
heard
the
exhaust
of
its
engines
long
before
he
could
see
the
building
so
blinding
was
the
drift
here
he
struck
inland
from
the
river
and
skirting
the
edges
of
the
town
made
his
way
by
unfrequented
streets
and
alleys
bearing
in
the
general
direction
of
upper
main
street
to
find
himself
at
last
almost
exhausted
in
the
alley
behind
the
pike
mansion
there
he
paused
leaning
heavily
against
a
board
fence
and
gazing
at
the
vaguely
outlined
gray
plane
which
was
all
that
could
be
made
of
the
house
through
the
blizzard
he
had
often
very
often
stood
in
this
same
place
at
night
and
there
was
one
window
pike
which
he
had
guessed
to
be
mamie
the
storm
was
so
thick
that
he
could
not
see
this
window
now
but
he
looked
a
long
time
through
the
thickness
at
that
part
of
the
gray
plane
where
he
knew
it
was
then
his
lips
parted
mamie
he
said
softly
goodbye
mamie
he
bent
his
body
against
the
wind
and
went
on
still
keeping
to
the
back
ways
until
he
came
to
the
alley
which
passed
behind
his
own
home
where
however
he
paused
only
for
a
moment
to
make
a
quick
survey
of
the
premises
a
glance
satisfied
him
he
ran
to
the
next
fence
hoisted
himself
wearily
over
it
and
dropped
into
roger
tabor
back
yard
he
took
shelter
from
the
wind
for
a
moment
or
two
leaning
against
the
fence
breathing
heavily
then
he
stumbled
on
across
the
obliterated
paths
of
a
until
he
reached
the
house
and
beginning
with
the
kitchen
began
to
make
the
circuit
of
the
windows
peering
cautiously
into
each
as
he
went
ready
to
tap
on
the
pane
should
he
catch
a
glimpse
of
ariel
and
prepared
to
run
if
he
stumbled
upon
her
grandfather
but
the
place
seemed
empty
he
had
made
his
reconnaisance
apparently
in
vain
and
was
on
the
point
of
going
away
when
he
heard
the
click
of
the
front
gate
and
saw
ariel
coming
towards
him
her
old
cloak
about
her
head
and
shoulders
the
patched
scant
faded
skirt
which
he
knew
so
well
blowing
about
her
tumultuously
at
the
sound
of
the
gate
he
had
crouched
close
against
the
side
of
the
house
but
she
saw
him
at
once
she
stopped
abruptly
and
throwing
the
back
from
her
head
looked
at
him
through
the
driven
fog
of
snow
one
of
her
hands
was
stretched
towards
him
involuntarily
and
it
was
in
that
attitude
that
he
long
remembered
her
standing
in
the
drift
which
had
piled
up
against
the
gate
almost
the
shabby
skirt
and
the
black
flapping
like
torn
sails
one
hand
like
that
of
a
figure
in
a
tableau
her
brown
face
with
its
thin
features
mottled
with
cold
and
unlovely
her
startled
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
a
strange
wild
tenderness
that
held
something
of
the
laughter
of
whole
companionship
in
it
mingling
with
a
loyalty
and
championship
that
was
almost
ferocious
she
looked
an
undine
of
the
snow
suddenly
she
ran
to
him
still
keeping
her
hand
until
it
touched
his
own
how
did
you
know
me
he
said
know
you
was
all
the
answer
she
made
to
that
question
come
into
the
house
i
got
some
coffee
on
the
stove
for
you
i
been
up
and
down
the
street
waiting
for
you
ever
since
it
began
to
get
light
your
grandfather
wo
he
at
uncle
jonas
he
wo
be
back
till
noon
there
no
one
here
she
led
him
to
the
where
he
stamped
and
shook
himself
he
was
snow
from
head
to
foot
i
running
away
from
the
good
gomorrah
he
said
but
i
stopped
to
look
back
and
i
a
pretty
white
pillar
i
know
where
you
stopped
to
look
back
she
answered
brushing
him
heartily
with
her
red
hands
you
came
in
the
alley
way
it
was
mamie
window
he
did
not
reply
and
the
only
visible
token
that
he
had
any
consciousness
of
this
clairvoyance
of
hers
was
a
slight
lift
of
his
higher
eyebrow
she
wasted
no
time
in
getting
him
to
the
kitchen
where
when
she
had
removed
his
overcoat
she
placed
him
in
a
chair
unwound
the
comforter
and
as
carefully
as
a
nurse
lifted
the
cap
from
his
injured
head
when
the
strip
of
towel
was
disclosed
she
stood
quite
still
for
a
moment
with
the
cap
in
her
hand
then
with
a
broken
little
cry
she
stooped
and
kissed
a
lock
of
his
hair
which
escaped
discolored
beneath
the
bandage
stop
that
he
commanded
horribly
embarrassed
oh
joe
she
cried
i
knew
i
knew
it
was
there
but
to
see
it
and
it
my
fault
for
leaving
you
i
had
to
go
or
i
would
have
i
where
you
hear
about
it
he
asked
shortly
i
have
been
to
bed
she
answered
grandfather
and
i
were
up
all
night
at
uncle
jonas
and
colonel
flitcroft
came
about
two
and
he
told
us
did
he
tell
you
about
norbert
yes
a
great
deal
she
poured
coffee
into
a
cup
from
a
pot
on
the
stove
brought
it
to
him
then
placing
some
thin
slices
of
bread
upon
a
gridiron
began
to
toast
them
over
the
hot
coals
the
colonel
said
that
norbert
thought
he
would
get
well
she
concluded
and
arp
said
norbert
was
the
kind
that
never
die
and
they
had
quite
an
argument
what
were
you
doing
at
jonas
tabor
asked
joe
drinking
his
coffee
with
a
brightening
eye
we
were
sent
for
she
answered
what
for
she
toasted
the
bread
attentively
without
replying
and
when
she
decided
that
it
was
brown
enough
piled
it
on
a
warm
plate
this
she
brought
to
him
and
kneeling
in
front
of
him
her
elbow
on
his
knee
offered
for
his
consideration
looking
steadfastly
up
at
his
eyes
he
began
to
eat
ravenously
what
for
he
repeated
i
did
suppose
jonas
would
let
you
come
in
his
house
was
he
sick
joe
she
said
quietly
disregarding
his
questions
joe
have
you
got
to
run
away
yes
i
got
to
he
answered
would
you
have
to
go
to
prison
if
you
stayed
she
asked
this
with
a
breathless
tensity
i
not
going
to
beg
father
to
help
me
out
he
said
determinedly
he
said
he
would
and
he
be
spared
the
chance
he
wo
mind
that
nobody
will
care
nobody
what
does
anybody
care
what
do
now
you
thinking
of
mamie
she
cried
i
can
always
tell
whenever
you
do
talk
naturally
you
thinking
of
her
he
poured
down
the
last
of
the
coffee
growing
red
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
ariel
he
said
if
i
ever
come
back
wait
she
interrupted
would
you
have
to
go
to
prison
right
away
if
they
caught
you
oh
it
is
that
he
laughed
sadly
but
i
going
to
clear
out
i
not
going
to
take
any
chances
i
want
to
see
other
parts
of
the
world
other
kinds
of
people
i
might
have
gone
anyhow
soon
even
if
it
had
been
for
last
night
do
you
ever
feel
that
way
you
know
i
do
she
said
i
told
you
how
often
but
joe
joe
you
have
any
money
you
got
to
have
money
to
live
you
need
worry
about
that
returned
the
master
of
seven
dollars
genially
i
saved
enough
to
take
care
of
me
for
a
long
time
joe
please
i
know
it
is
so
if
you
could
wait
just
a
little
while
only
a
few
weeks
only
a
few
joe
what
for
i
could
let
you
have
all
you
want
it
would
be
such
a
beautiful
thing
for
me
joe
oh
i
know
how
you
feel
you
would
even
let
me
give
you
that
dollar
i
found
in
the
street
last
year
but
this
would
be
only
lending
it
to
you
and
you
could
pay
me
back
sometime
ariel
he
exclaimed
and
setting
his
empty
cup
upon
the
floor
took
her
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
her
till
the
empty
plate
which
had
held
the
toast
dropped
from
her
hand
and
broke
into
fragments
you
been
reading
the
arabian
nights
no
no
she
cried
vehemently
grandfather
would
give
me
anything
he
give
me
all
the
money
i
ask
for
money
said
joe
which
of
us
is
wandering
money
roger
tabor
give
you
money
not
for
a
while
a
great
many
things
have
to
be
settled
first
what
things
joe
she
asked
earnestly
do
you
think
it
bad
of
me
not
to
feel
things
i
ought
to
feel
no
then
i
glad
she
said
and
something
in
the
way
she
spoke
made
him
start
with
pain
remembering
the
same
words
spoken
in
the
same
tone
by
another
voice
the
night
before
on
the
veranda
i
glad
joe
because
i
seemed
all
wrong
to
myself
uncle
jonas
died
last
night
and
i
have
been
able
to
get
sorry
perhaps
it
because
i
been
so
frightened
about
you
but
i
think
not
for
i
was
sorry
even
before
colonel
flitcroft
told
me
about
you
jonas
tabor
dead
said
joe
why
i
saw
him
on
the
street
yesterday
yes
and
i
saw
him
just
before
i
came
out
on
the
porch
where
you
were
he
was
there
in
the
hall
he
and
judge
pike
had
been
having
a
long
talk
they
been
in
some
speculations
together
and
it
had
all
turned
out
well
it
very
strange
but
they
say
now
that
uncle
jonas
heart
was
weak
he
was
an
old
man
you
know
almost
eighty
and
he
been
very
anxious
about
his
money
the
judge
had
persuaded
him
to
risk
it
and
the
shock
of
finding
that
he
made
a
great
deal
suddenly
i
heard
he
had
that
same
shock
before
said
joe
when
he
sold
out
to
your
father
yes
but
this
was
different
grandfather
says
he
told
me
it
was
in
one
of
those
big
risky
businesses
that
judge
pike
likes
to
go
into
and
last
night
it
was
all
finished
the
strain
was
over
and
uncle
jonas
started
home
his
house
is
only
a
little
way
from
the
pikes
you
know
but
he
dropped
down
in
the
snow
at
his
own
gate
and
some
people
who
were
going
by
saw
him
fall
he
was
dead
before
grandfather
got
there
i
ca
be
sorry
said
joe
slowly
neither
can
i
that
the
dreadful
part
of
it
they
say
he
made
a
will
that
though
he
was
sharper
than
anybody
else
in
the
whole
world
about
any
other
matter
of
business
that
was
the
one
thing
he
put
off
and
we
all
the
kin
he
had
in
the
world
grandfather
and
i
and
they
say
her
voice
sank
to
a
whisper
of
excitement
they
say
he
was
richer
than
anybody
knew
and
that
this
last
business
with
judge
pike
the
very
thing
that
killed
him
something
about
grain
made
him
five
times
richer
than
before
she
put
her
hand
on
the
boy
arm
and
he
let
it
remain
there
her
eyes
still
sought
his
with
a
tremulous
appeal
god
bless
you
ariel
he
said
it
going
to
be
a
great
thing
for
you
yes
yes
it
is
the
tears
came
suddenly
to
her
eyes
i
was
foolish
last
night
but
there
had
been
such
a
long
time
of
wanting
things
and
now
and
now
grandfather
and
i
can
go
you
going
too
joe
chuckled
it
heartless
i
suppose
but
i
settled
it

cried

me
a
thousand
times
what
said

times

thousand

to
paris
where
he
can
see
at
last
how
the
great
ones

painted
where
the
others
can
show
him
to
paris
where
we
can
study
together
where
he
can
learn
how
to
put
the
pictures
he
sees
upon
canvas
and
where
i
go
on
joe
encouraged
her
i
want
to
hear
you
say
it
you
mean
that

going
to
study

mean
that

to

how
to
make
such
fellows
as
eugene

you
to
dance
go
ahead
and
say
it
yes
to
learn
how
to
dress
she
said
joe
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
rose
and
took
the
ragged
overcoat
from
the
back
of
his
chair
where
that
muffler
he
asked
she
brought
it
from
where
she
had
placed
it
to
dry
behind
the
stove
joe
she
said
huskily
ca
you
wait
till
till
the
estate
is
settled
and
you
can
coax
your
grandfather
to
no
no
but
you
could
go
with
us
to
paris
he
would
take
you
as
his
secretary
aha
joe
voice
rang
out
gayly
as
he
rose
refreshed
by
the
coffee
toast
and
warmth
she
had
given
him
you
been
ariel
like
eugene
please
joe
where
my
tin
he
found
it
himself
upon
the
table
where
he
had
set
it
down
i
going
to
earn
a
dishonest
living
he
went
on
i
have
an
engagement
to
take
a
freight
at
a
that
a
friend
of
mine
half
a
mile
south
of
the
yards
thank
god
i
going
to
get
away
from
canaan
wait
joe
she
caught
at
his
sleeve
i
want
you
to
he
had
swung
out
of
the
room
and
was
already
at
the
she
followed
him
closely
ariel
no
no
wait
joe
he
took
her
right
hand
in
his
own
and
gave
it
a
manly
shake
all
right
he
said
he
threw
open
the
door
and
stepped
out
but
she
sought
to
detain
him
oh
have
you
got
to
go
she
cried
do
you
ever
worry
about
me
he
bent
his
head
to
the
storm
as
he
sprang
down
the
steps
and
swirled
between
them
he
disappeared
in
a
white
whirlwind
she
stood
for
several
minutes
shivering
in
the
doorway
then
it
came
to
her
that
she
would
not
know
where
to
write
to
him
she
ran
down
to
the
gate
and
through
it
already
the
blizzard
had
covered
his
footprints
vii
give
a
dog
a
bad
name
the
passing
of
joseph
from
canaan
was
complete
it
was
an
evanishment
for
which
there
was
neither
sackcloth
nor
surprise
and
though
there
came
no
news
of
him
it
can
not
be
said
that
canaan
did
not
hear
of
him
for
surely
it
could
hear
itself
talk
the
death
of
jonas
tabor
and
young
louden
crime
and
flight
incited
high
doings
in
the
national
house
windows
many
days
the
sages
lingered
with
the
broken
meats
of
morals
left
over
from
the
banquet
of
gossip
but
after
all
it
is
with
the
ladies
of
a
community
that
reputations
finally
rest
and
the
matrons
of
canaan
had
long
ago
made
joe
exceedingly
uncertain
now
they
made
it
certain
they
did
not
fail
of
assistance
the
most
powerful
influence
in
the
town
was
ponderously
corroborative
martin
pike
who
stood
for
all
that
was
respectable
and
financial
who
passed
the
plate
o
sundays
who
held
the
fortunes
of
the
town
in
his
left
hand
who
was
trustee
for
the
widow
and
orphan
martin
pike
patron
of
all
worthy
charities
courted
by
ministers
feared
by
the
wicked
and
idle
revered
by
the
good
judge
martin
pike
never
referred
to
the
runaway
save
in
the
accents
of
an
august
doomster
his
testimony
settled
it
in
time
the
precise
nature
of
the
fugitive
sins
was
distorted
in
report
and
grew
vague
it
was
recalled
that
he
had
done
dread
things
he
became
a
tradition
a
legend
and
a
warning
to
the
young
a
richard
in
the
bush
to
frighten
colts
he
was
preached
at
boys
caught
playing
marbles
for
keeps
do
you
want
to
grow
up
like
joe
louden
the
very
name
became
a
darkling
threat
and
children
of
the
town
would
have
run
had
one
called
suddenly
here
comes
joe
louden
thus
does
the
evil
men
do
live
after
them
and
the
of
the
unrighteous
increase
when
they
are
sped
very
little
of
joseph
adventures
and
occupations
during
the
time
of
his
wandering
is
revealed
to
us
he
always
had
an
unwilling
memory
for
pain
and
was
not
afterwards
wont
to
speak
of
those
years
which
cut
the
hard
lines
in
his
face
the
first
account
of
him
to
reach
canaan
came
as
directly
to
the
windows
of
the
national
house
as
arp
hastening
thither
from
the
station
satchel
in
hand
could
bring
it
this
was
on
a
september
morning
two
years
after
the
flight
and
eskew
it
appears
had
been
to
the
state
fair
and
had
beheld
many
things
strangely
affirming
his
constant
testimony
that
this
unhappy
world
increaseth
in
sin
strangest
of
all
his
meeting
with
our
vagrant
scalawag
of
canaan
not
a
blamebit
of
doubt
about
it
declared
eskew
to
the
incredulous
conclave
there
was
that
joe
and
nobody
else
stuck
up
in
a
little
box
outside
a
tent
at
the
fair
grounds
and
sellin
tickets
to
see
the
spotted
wild
boy
yes
it
was
joe
louden
think
you
arp
could
forget
that
face
those
crooked
eyebrows
had
eskew
tested
the
recognition
had
he
spoken
with
the
outcast
had
he
not
ay
but
with
such
peculiar
result
that
the
battle
of
words
among
the
sages
began
with
a
true
onset
of
the
regulars
for
according
to
eskew
narrative
when
he
had
delivered
grimly
at
the
boy
this
charge
i
know
you
you
joe
louden
the
extraordinary
reply
had
been
made
promptly
and
without
change
of
countenance
positively
no
free
seats
on
this
the
house
divided
one
party
maintaining
that
joe
had
thus
endeavored
to
evade
recognition
the
other
to
the
embitterment
of
arp
that
the
reply
was
a
distinct
admission
of
identity
and
at
the
same
time
a
refusal
to
grant
any
favors
on
the
score
of
past
acquaintanceship
goaded
by
inquiries
arp
who
had
little
desire
to
recall
such
waste
of
silver
admitted
more
than
he
had
intended
that
he
had
purchased
a
ticket
and
gone
in
to
see
the
spotted
wild
boy
halting
in
his
description
of
this
marvel
with
the
unsatisfactory
and
acrid
statement
that
the
wild
boy
was
simply
spotted
and
the
stung
query
i
suppose
you
know
what
a
spot
is
squire
when
he
came
out
of
the
tent
he
had
narrowly
examined
the
who
seemed
unaware
of
his
scrutiny
and
when
not
engaged
with
his
tickets
applied
himself
to
a
dirty
book
it
was
joseph
louden
reasserted
eskew
a
little
taller
a
little
paler
incredibly
shabby
and
miraculously
thin
if
there
were
any
doubt
left
his
forehead
was
somewhat
disfigured
by
the
scar
of
an
old
wound
such
as
might
have
been
caused
by
a
blunt
instrument
in
the
nature
of
a
poker
what
the
matter
with
you
arp
whirled
upon
uncle
joe
davey
who
was
enjoying
himself
by
repeating
at
intervals
the
unreasonable
words
could
of
joe
without
any
explanation
why
could
it
shouted
eskew
it
was
do
you
think
my
eyes
are
as
fur
gone
as
yours
i
saw
him
i
tell
you
the
same
ornery
joe
louden
run
away
and
sellin
tickets
for
a
he
was
even
the
boss
of
it
the
manager
was
about
the
human
i
ever
saw
and
most
humans
look
mighty
mean
accordin
to
my
way
of
thinkin
riffraff
of
the
riffraff
are
his
friends
now
same
as
they
were
here
weeds
and
a
weed
always
was
and
always
will
be
him
and
his
kind
ai
any
more
than
jimpsons
overrun
everything
if
you
give
a
chance
they
have
to
be
hoed
out
and
scattered
even
then
like
as
not
they
come
back
next
year
and
ruin
your
plantin
once
more
that
boy
joe
turn
up
here
again
some
day
you
see
if
he
do
he
a
seed
of
trouble
and
iniquity
and
anything
of
that
kind
is
sure
to
come
back
to
canaan
arp
stuck
to
his
prediction
for
several
months
then
he
began
to
waver
and
evade
by
the
end
of
the
second
year
following
its
first
utterance
he
had
formed
the
habit
of
denying
that
he
had
ever
made
it
at
all
and
finally
having
come
to
believe
with
all
his
heart
that
the
prophecy
had
been
deliberately
foisted
upon
him
and
put
in
his
mouth
by
squire
buckalew
became
so
sore
upon
the
subject
that
even
the
hardiest
dared
not
refer
to
it
in
his
presence
eskew
story
of
the
was
the
only
news
of
joe
louden
that
came
to
canaan
during
seven
years
another
citizen
of
the
town
encountered
the
wanderer
however
but
under
circumstances
so
susceptible
to
misconception
that
in
a
moment
of
illumination
he
decided
to
let
the
matter
rest
in
a
golden
silence
this
was
bantry
having
elected
an
elaborate
course
in
the
arts
at
the
university
which
was
of
his
possessions
what
more
natural
than
that
eugene
should
seek
the
metropolis
for
the
short
easter
vacation
of
his
senior
year
in
order
that
his
perusal
of
the
masters
should
be
uninterrupted
but
it
was
his
misfortune
to
find
the
metropolitan
museum
less
interesting
than
some
intricate
phases
of
the
gayety
of
new
york
phases
very
difficult
to
understand
without
elaborate
study
and
a
series
of
experiments
which
the
discreetly
selfish
permit
others
to
make
for
them
briefly
eugene
found
himself
dancing
one
night
with
a
young
person
in
a
big
hat
at
the
a
crowded
hall
down
very
deep
in
the
town
and
not
at
all
the
place
for
eugene
acute
crises
are
to
be
expected
at
the
and
eugene
was
the
only
one
present
who
was
thoroughly
surprised
when
that
of
this
night
arrived
though
all
of
the
merrymakers
were
frightened
when
they
perceived
its
extent
there
is
no
need
to
detail
the
catastrophe
it
came
suddenly
and
the
knife
did
not
flash
sick
and
thinking
of
himself
eugene
stood
staring
at
the
figure
lying
before
him
upon
the
reddening
floor
a
rabble
fought
with
the
quick
policemen
at
the
doors
and
then
the
lights
went
out
extinguished
by
the
proprietor
living
up
to
his
reputation
for
always
being
thoughtful
of
his
patrons
the
place
had
been
a
nightmare
it
became
a
black
impossibility
eugene
staggered
to
one
of
the
open
windows
from
the
sill
of
which
a
man
had
just
leaped
do
jump
said
a
voice
close
to
his
ear
that
fellow
broke
his
leg
i
think
and
they
caught
him
anyway
as
soon
as
he
struck
the
pavement
it
a
big
raid
come
this
way
a
light
hand
fell
upon
his
arm
and
he
followed
its
leading
blindly
to
find
himself
pushed
through
a
narrow
doorway
and
down
a
flight
of
tricky
wooden
steps
at
the
foot
of
which
silhouetted
against
a
street
light
a
tall
policeman
was
on
guard
he
laid
masterful
hands
on
eugene
mack
whispered
a
cautious
voice
from
the
stairway
that
a
friend
of
mine
and
not
one
of
those
you
need
he
only
a
student
and
scared
to
death
hurry
said
the
policeman
under
his
breath
twisting
eugene
sharply
by
him
into
the
street
after
which
he
stormed
vehemently
on
yer
way
both
of
ye
move
on
up
the
street
do
be
tryin
to
poke
yer
heads
in
here
ye
be
more
anxious
to
git
out
once
ye
got
in
i
tell
ye
a
sob
of
relief
came
from
bantry
as
he
gained
the
next
corner
the
slight
figure
of
his
conductor
at
his
side
you
better
not
go
to
places
like
the
said
the
latter
gravely
i
been
watching
you
for
an
hour
you
were
dancing
with
the
girl
who
did
the
cutting
eugene
leaned
against
a
wall
faint
one
arm
across
his
face
he
was
too
ill
to
see
or
care
who
it
was
that
had
saved
him
i
never
saw
her
before
he
babbled
incoherently
never
never
never
i
thought
she
looked
handsome
and
asked
her
if
she
dance
with
me
then
i
saw
she
seemed
queer
and
wild
and
she
kept
guiding
and
pushing
as
we
danced
until
we
were
near
that
man
and
then
she
then
it
was
all
done
before
yes
said
the
other
she
been
threatening
to
do
it
for
a
long
time
jealous
mighty
good
sort
of
a
girl
though
in
lots
of
ways
only
yesterday
i
talked
with
her
and
almost
thought
i
calmed
her
out
of
it
but
you
ca
tell
with
some
women
they
brighten
up
and
talk
straight
and
seem
sensible
one
minute
and
promise
to
behave
and
mean
it
too
and
the
next
there
they
go
making
a
scene
cutting
somebody
or
killing
themselves
you
ca
count
on
them
but
not
to
the
point
exactly
i
expect
you
better
keep
away
from
the
if
you
been
caught
with
the
rest
you
have
had
a
hard
time
and
they
have
found
out
your
real
name
too
because
pretty
serious
on
account
of
your
dancing
with
her
when
she
did
it
and
the
canaan
papers
would
have
got
hold
of
it
and
you
would
be
invited
to
judge
pike
any
more
eugene
eugene
dropped
his
arm
from
his
eyes
and
stared
into
the
face
of
his
joe
louden
he
gasped
i
never
tell
said
joe
you
better
keep
out
of
all
this
sort
you
do
understand
it
and
you
do
you
do
do
it
because
you
care
he
smiled
wanly
his
odd
distorted
smile
of
friendliness
when
you
go
back
you
might
tell
father
i
all
right
i
working
through
a
here
and
remember
me
to
norbert
flitcroft
he
finished
with
a
chuckle
eugene
covered
his
eyes
again
and
groaned
it
all
right
joe
assured
him
you
as
safe
as
if
it
had
never
happened
and
i
expect
he
went
on
thoughtfully
i
expect
maybe
you
prefer
not
to
say
you
seen
me
when
you
go
back
to
canaan
well
that
all
right
i
do
suppose
father
will
be
asking
after
me
exactly
no
he
does
said
eugene
still
white
and
shaking
do
stand
talking
i
sick
of
course
returned
joe
but
there
one
thing
i
would
like
to
ask
you
your
father
health
is
perfect
i
believe
it
it
it
was
something
else
joe
stammered
pitifully
are
they
all
are
they
all
all
right
at
at
judge
pike
quite
eugene
replied
sharply
are
you
going
to
get
me
away
from
here
i
sick
i
tell
you
this
street
said
joe
and
cheerfully
led
the
way
five
minutes
later
the
two
had
parted
and
joe
leaned
against
a
cheap
restaurant
drearily
staring
after
the
lamps
of
the
gypsy
he
had
found
for
his
eugene
had
not
offered
to
share
the
vehicle
with
him
had
not
even
replied
to
his
and
joe
himself
had
neglected
to
do
something
he
might
well
have
done
he
had
not
asked
eugene
for
news
of
ariel
tabor
it
will
not
justify
him
entirely
to
suppose
that
he
assumed
that
her
grandfather
and
she
had
left
canaan
never
to
return
and
therefore
eugene
knew
nothing
of
her
no
such
explanation
serves
joe
for
his
neglect
for
the
fair
truth
is
that
he
had
not
thought
of
her
she
had
been
a
sort
of
playmate
before
his
flight
a
friend
taken
for
granted
about
whom
he
had
consciously
thought
little
more
than
he
thought
about
himself
and
easily
forgotten
not
forgotten
in
the
sense
that
she
had
passed
out
of
his
memory
but
forgotten
none
the
less
she
had
never
had
a
place
in
his
imaginings
and
so
it
befell
that
when
he
no
longer
saw
her
from
day
to
day
she
had
gone
from
his
thoughts
altogether
viii
a
bad
penny
turns
up
eugene
did
not
inform
canaan
nor
any
inhabitant
of
his
adventure
of
nor
did
any
hear
of
his
meeting
with
his
and
after
arp
adventure
five
years
passed
into
the
imperishable
before
the
town
heard
of
the
wanderer
again
and
then
it
heard
at
first
hand
arp
prophecy
fell
true
and
he
took
it
back
to
his
bosom
again
claimed
it
as
his
own
the
morning
of
its
fulfilment
joe
louden
had
come
back
to
canaan
the
elder
louden
was
the
first
to
know
of
his
prodigal
return
he
was
alone
in
the
office
of
the
factory
of
which
he
was
the
superintendent
when
the
young
man
came
in
unannounced
he
was
still
pale
and
thin
his
eyebrows
had
the
same
crook
one
corner
of
his
mouth
the
same
droop
he
was
only
an
inch
or
so
taller
not
enough
to
be
thought
a
tall
man
and
yet
for
a
few
moments
the
father
did
not
recognize
his
son
but
stared
at
him
inquiring
his
business
during
those
few
seconds
of
unrecognition
louden
was
somewhat
favorably
impressed
with
the
stranger
appearance
you
do
know
me
said
joe
smiling
cheerfully
perhaps
changed
in
seven
years
and
he
held
out
his
hand
then
louden
knew
he
tilted
back
in
his
his
mouth
falling
open
good
god
he
said
not
noticing
the
hand
have
you
come
back
joe
hand
fell
yes
i
come
back
to
canaan
louden
looked
at
him
a
long
time
without
replying
finally
he
remarked
i
see
you
still
got
a
scar
on
your
forehead
oh
i
forgotten
all
about
that
said
the
other
twisting
his
hat
in
his
hands
seven
years
wipes
out
a
good
many
grievances
and
wrongs
you
think
so
mr
louden
grunted
i
suppose
it
might
wipe
out
a
good
deal
with
some
people
how
you
happen
to
stop
off
at
canaan
on
your
way
somewhere
i
suppose
no
i
come
back
to
stay
louden
plainly
received
this
as
no
pleasant
surprise
what
for
he
asked
slowly
to
practise
law
father
what
yes
said
the
young
man
there
ought
to
be
an
opening
here
for
me
i
a
graduate
of
as
good
a
as
there
is
in
the
country
you
are
certainly
said
joe
quietly
i
put
myself
through
working
in
the
summer
working
louden
snorted
oh
worse
than
that
sometimes
returned
his
son
laughing
anything
i
could
get
but
i
always
wanted
to
come
back
home
and
work
here
louden
leaned
forward
a
hand
on
each
knee
his
brow
deeply
corrugated
do
you
think
you
get
much
practice
in
canaan
why
not
i
had
a
year
in
a
good
office
in
new
york
since
i
left
the
school
and
i
think
i
ought
to
get
along
all
right
oh
said
louden
briefly
you
do
yes
do
you
who
do
you
think
in
canaan
would
put
a
case
in
your
hands
oh
i
do
expect
to
get
anything
important
at
the
start
but
after
a
while
with
your
reputation
the
smile
which
had
faded
from
joe
lips
returned
to
them
oh
i
know
they
thought
i
was
a
sort
of
boy
he
answered
lightly
and
that
it
was
a
foolish
thing
to
run
away
for
nothing
but
you
had
said
i
must
come
to
you
for
help
i
meant
it
said
louden
but
that
seven
years
ago
and
i
suppose
the
town
forgotten
all
about
it
and
forgotten
me
too
so
you
see
i
can
make
a
fresh
start
that
what
i
came
back
for
you
made
up
your
mind
to
stay
here
then
yes
i
do
believe
said
louden
with
marked
uneasiness
that
louden
would
be
willing
to
let
you
live
with
us
no
said
joe
gently
i
did
expect
it
he
turned
to
the
window
and
looked
out
averting
his
face
yet
scoring
himself
with
the
contempt
he
had
learned
to
feel
for
those
who
pity
themselves
his
father
had
not
even
asked
him
to
sit
down
there
was
a
long
silence
disturbed
only
by
louden
breathing
which
could
be
heard
heavy
and
troubled
at
last
joe
turned
again
smiling
as
before
well
i
wo
keep
you
from
your
work
he
said
i
suppose
you
pretty
busy
yes
i
am
responded
his
father
promptly
but
i
see
you
again
before
you
go
i
want
to
give
you
some
advice
i
not
going
said
joe
not
going
to
leave
canaan
i
mean
where
will
i
find
eugene
at
the
tocsin
office
he
the
assistant
editor
judge
pike
bought
the
tocsin
last
year
and
he
thinks
a
good
deal
of
eugene
do
forget
i
said
to
come
to
see
me
again
before
you
go
joe
came
over
to
the
older
man
and
held
out
his
hand
shake
hands
father
he
said
louden
looked
at
him
out
of
small
implacable
eyes
the
steady
hostility
of
which
only
his
wife
or
the
imperious
martin
pike
his
employer
could
quell
he
shook
his
head
i
do
see
any
use
in
it
he
answered
it
would
mean
anything
all
my
life
i
been
a
man
and
an
abiding
man
before
you
got
in
trouble
you
never
did
anything
you
ought
to
you
ran
with
the
lowest
people
in
town
and
i
and
all
your
folks
were
ashamed
of
you
i
do
see
that
we
got
a
call
to
be
any
different
now
he
swung
round
to
his
desk
emphatically
on
the
last
word
and
joe
turned
away
and
went
out
quietly
but
it
was
a
bright
morning
to
which
he
emerged
from
the
outer
doors
of
the
factory
and
he
made
his
way
towards
main
street
at
a
lively
gait
as
he
turned
the
corner
opposite
the
national
house
he
walked
into
eskew
arp
the
old
man
drew
back
angrily
lord
mercy
cried
joe
heartily
it
arp
i
almost
ran
you
down
then
as
arp
made
no
response
but
stood
in
the
way
staring
at
him
fiercely
do
you
know
me
mr
arp
the
young
man
asked
i
joe
louden
eskew
abruptly
thrust
his
face
close
to
the
other
no
free
seats
he
hissed
savagely
and
swept
across
to
the
hotel
to
set
his
world
afire
joe
looked
after
the
irate
receding
figure
and
watched
it
disappear
into
the
main
street
door
of
the
national
house
as
the
door
closed
he
became
aware
of
a
mighty
shadow
upon
the
pavement
and
turning
beheld
a
fat
young
man
wearing
upon
his
forehead
a
scar
similar
to
his
own
waddling
by
with
eyes
fixed
upon
him
how
are
you
norbert
joe
began
do
you
remember
me
i
he
came
to
a
full
stop
as
the
fat
one
thrusting
out
an
under
lip
as
his
only
token
of
recognition
passed
balefully
on
joe
proceeded
slowly
until
he
came
to
the
tocsin
building
at
the
foot
of
the
stairway
leading
up
to
the
offices
he
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
then
he
turned
away
and
walked
towards
the
quieter
part
of
main
street
most
of
the
people
he
met
took
no
notice
of
him
only
two
or
three
giving
him
second
glances
of
as
though
he
reminded
them
of
some
one
they
could
not
place
and
it
was
not
until
he
had
come
near
the
pike
mansion
that
he
saw
a
full
recognition
in
the
eyes
of
one
of
the
many
whom
he
knew
and
who
had
known
him
in
his
boyhood
in
the
town
a
lady
turning
a
corner
looked
up
carelessly
and
then
within
a
few
feet
of
him
as
if
startled
cheeks
went
a
sudden
crimson
for
it
was
the
lady
of
his
old
dreams
seven
years
had
made
mamie
pike
only
prettier
she
had
grown
into
her
young
womanhood
with
an
ampleness
that
had
nothing
of
oversufficiency
in
it
nor
anywhere
a
threat
that
some
day
there
might
be
too
much
of
her
not
quite
seventeen
when
he
had
last
seen
her
now
at
her
amber
hair
elaborately
becoming
a
plump
and
regular
face
all
of
her
old
charm
came
over
him
once
more
and
it
immediately
seemed
to
him
that
he
saw
clearly
his
real
reason
for
coming
back
to
canaan
she
had
been
the
of
his
child
days
the
golden
princess
playing
in
the
and
in
his
early
boyhood
until
he
had
grown
wicked
and
shabby
he
had
been
sometimes
invited
to
the
pike
mansion
for
the
games
and
of
the
daughter
of
the
house
before
her
dancing
days
began
he
had
gone
timidly
not
daring
ever
to
call
her
in
quaker
meeting
or
but
watching
her
reverently
and
surreptitiously
and
continually
she
had
always
seemed
to
him
the
one
thing
of
all
the
world
most
rare
most
mysterious
most
unapproachable
she
had
not
offered
an
apparition
less
so
in
those
days
when
he
began
to
come
under
the
suspicion
of
canaan
when
the
old
people
began
to
look
upon
him
hotly
the
young
people
coldly
his
very
exclusion
wove
for
him
a
glamour
about
her
and
she
was
more
than
ever
his
moon
far
lovely
unattainable
and
brilliant
never
to
be
reached
by
his
lifted
arms
but
only
by
his
lifted
eyes
nor
had
his
long
absence
obliterated
that
light
somewhere
in
his
dreams
it
always
had
place
shining
perhaps
with
a
fainter
lustre
as
the
years
grew
to
seven
but
never
gone
altogether
now
at
last
that
he
stood
in
her
very
presence
again
it
sprang
to
the
full
flood
of
its
old
brilliance
and
more
as
she
came
to
her
of
surprise
startled
he
took
his
courage
in
two
hands
and
lifting
his
hat
stepped
to
her
side
you
you
remember
me
he
stammered
yes
she
answered
a
little
breathlessly
ah
that
kind
of
you
he
cried
and
began
to
walk
on
with
her
unconsciously
i
feel
like
a
returned
ghost
wandering
about
invisible
and
unrecognized
so
few
people
seem
to
remember
me
i
think
you
are
wrong
i
think
you
find
everybody
remembers
you
she
responded
uneasily
no
i
afraid
not
he
began
i
i
afraid
they
do
joe
laughed
a
little
my
father
was
saying
something
like
that
to
me
a
while
ago
he
meant
that
they
used
to
think
me
a
great
scapegrace
here
do
you
mean
that
i
scarcely
like
to
say
she
answered
her
face
growing
more
troubled
for
they
were
close
on
the
imperial
domain
but
it
long
ago
and
i
really
did
do
anything
so
outrageous
it
seems
to
me
he
laughed
again
i
know
your
father
was
angry
with
me
once
or
twice
especially
the
night
i
hid
on
your
porch
to
watch
you
to
watch
you
dance
i
mean
but
you
see
i
come
back
to
rehabilitate
myself
to
she
interrupted
him
they
were
not
far
from
her
gate
and
she
saw
her
father
standing
in
the
yard
directing
a
painter
who
was
at
work
on
one
of
the
deer
the
judge
was
apparently
in
good
spirits
laughing
with
the
workman
over
some
jest
between
them
but
that
did
not
lessen
mamie
nervousness
louden
she
said
in
as
kindly
a
tone
as
she
could
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
not
to
walk
with
me
my
father
would
not
like
it
joe
stopped
with
a
jerk
why
i
i
thought
i
go
in
and
shake
hands
with
him
and
tell
him
i
astonishment
that
partook
of
terror
and
of
awe
spread
itself
instantly
upon
her
face
good
gracious
she
cried
no
very
well
said
joe
humbly
he
was
too
late
to
get
away
with
any
good
grace
judge
pike
had
seen
them
and
even
as
joe
turned
to
go
rushed
down
to
the
gate
flung
it
open
and
motioned
his
daughter
to
enter
this
he
did
with
one
wide
sweep
of
his
arm
and
with
another
sweep
forbade
joe
to
look
upon
either
moon
or
sun
it
was
a
magnificent
gesture
it
excluded
the
young
man
from
the
street
judge
pike
street
and
from
the
town
judge
pike
town
it
swept
him
from
the
earth
abolished
him
denied
him
the
right
to
breathe
the
common
air
to
be
seen
of
men
and
at
once
a
headsman
stroke
and
an
excommunication
destroyed
him
soul
and
body
thus
rebuking
the
silly
providence
that
had
created
him
and
repairing
its
mistake
by
annihilating
him
this
hurling
olympian
gesture
smote
the
street
the
rails
of
the
sprang
and
quivered
with
the
shock
it
thundered
and
amid
the
dumfounding
uproar
of
the
wrath
of
a
god
the
will
of
the
canaanite
jove
wrote
the
words
in
fiery
letters
upon
the
ether
cease
to
be
joe
did
not
go
in
to
shake
hands
with
judge
pike
he
turned
the
next
corner
a
moment
later
and
went
down
the
quiet
street
which
led
to
the
house
which
had
been
his
home
he
did
not
glance
at
that
somewhat
grim
edifice
but
passed
it
his
eyes
averted
and
stopped
in
front
of
the
long
ramshackle
cottage
next
door
the
windows
were
boarded
the
dropped
even
to
the
ground
in
some
sections
the
chimneys
sagged
and
curved
the
roof
of
the
long
porch
sprinkled
shingles
over
the
unkempt
yard
with
every
wind
and
seemed
about
to
fall
the
place
was
desolate
with
long
emptiness
and
decay
it
looked
like
a
haunted
house
and
nailed
to
the
padlocked
gate
was
a
sign
half
obliterated
with
the
winters
it
had
fronted
for
sale
or
rent
joe
gat
him
meditatively
back
to
main
street
and
to
the
tocsin
building
this
time
he
did
not
hesitate
but
mounted
the
stairs
and
knocked
upon
the
door
of
the
assistant
editor
oh
said
eugene
you
turned
up
you
bantry
of
the
tocsin
was
not
at
all
the
eugene
rescued
from
the
the
present
gentleman
was
more
the
electric
freshman
than
the
frightened
adventurer
whom
joe
had
encountered
in
new
york
it
was
to
be
seen
immediately
that
the
assistant
editor
had
nothing
undaintily
about
him
nor
was
there
the
litter
on
his
desk
which
one
might
have
expected
he
had
the
air
of
a
gentleman
dilettante
who
amused
himself
slightly
by
spending
an
hour
or
two
in
the
room
now
and
then
it
was
the
evolution
to
the
perfect
of
his
freshman
manner
and
his
lively
apparel
though
somewhat
chastened
by
an
older
taste
might
have
been
foretold
from
that
which
had
smitten
canaan
seven
years
before
he
sat
not
at
the
orderly
and
handsome
desk
but
lay
stretched
upon
a
divan
of
green
leather
smoking
a
cigar
of
purest
ray
and
reading
sleepily
a
small
book
in
morocco
his
occupation
his
general
air
the
furniture
of
the
room
and
his
title
doubtless
equipped
with
a
corresponding
salary
might
have
inspired
in
an
observant
cynic
the
idea
that
here
lay
a
pet
of
fortune
whose
position
had
been
the
fruit
of
nepotism
or
mayhap
a
successful
wooing
of
some
daughter
wife
or
widow
eugene
looked
competent
for
that
i
come
back
to
stay
said
joe
bantry
had
dropped
his
book
and
raised
himself
on
an
elbow
exceedingly
interesting
he
said
i
suppose
you
try
to
find
something
to
do
i
do
think
you
could
get
a
place
here
judge
pike
owns
the
tocsin
and
i
greatly
fear
he
has
a
prejudice
against
you
i
expect
he
has
joe
chuckled
somewhat
sadly
but
i
do
want
newspaper
work
i
going
to
practice
law
by
jove
you
have
courage
my
festive
prodigal
vraiment
joe
cocked
his
head
to
one
side
with
his
old
look
of
the
friendly
puppy
you
always
did
like
to
talk
that
noveletty
way
you
he
said
impersonally
eugene
color
rose
have
you
saved
up
anything
to
starve
on
he
asked
crisply
oh
i
not
so
badly
off
i
had
a
salary
in
an
office
for
a
year
and
i
had
one
pretty
good
day
at
the
races
you
better
go
back
and
have
another
said
his
you
do
seem
to
comprehend
your
standing
in
canaan
i
beginning
to
joe
turned
to
the
door
it
funny
too
in
a
way
well
i
wo
keep
you
any
longer
i
just
stopped
in
to
say
he
paused
faltering
all
right
all
right
eugene
said
briskly
and
i
have
mentioned
that
i
saw
you
in
new
york
oh
i
did
suppose
that
you
would
and
you
need
say
anything
about
it
i
fancy
i
do
think
said
joe
i
do
think
that
you
need
be
afraid
do
that
be
sure
to
shut
the
door
please
it
rather
noisy
with
it
open
eugene
waved
his
hand
and
sank
back
upon
the
divan
joe
went
across
the
street
to
the
national
house
the
sages
fell
as
silent
as
if
he
had
been
martin
pike
they
had
just
had
the
pleasure
of
hearing
a
telephone
monologue
by
brown
the
clerk
to
which
they
listened
intently
yes
this
is
brown
oh
oh

at
the
station
he
said
i
give
you
my
check
to
send

for
it
excuse

said
the
clerk
we
have
no
rooms
what
cried
joe
innocently
why
i
never
knew
more
than
eight
people
to
stay
here
at
the
same
time
in
my
life
we
have
no
rooms
repeated
the
clerk
curtly
is
there
a
convention
here
we
have
no
rooms
i
say
joe
looked
up
into
the
condensed
eyes
of
brown
oh
he
said
i
see
deathly
silence
followed
him
to
the
door
but
as
it
closed
behind
him
he
heard
the
outbreak
of
the
sages
like
a
tidal
wave
striking
a
of
tin
cans
two
hours
later
he
descended
from
an
evil
ark
of
a
cab
at
the
corral
attached
to
beaver
beach
and
followed
the
path
through
the
marsh
to
the
crumbling
pier
a
man
was
seated
on
a
plank
by
the
water
edge
fishing
mike
said
joe
have
you
got
room
for
me
can
you
take
me
in
for
a
few
days
until
i
find
a
place
in
town
where
they
let
me
stay
the
man
rose
slowly
pushed
back
his
hat
and
stared
hard
at
the
wanderer
then
he
uttered
a
howl
of
joy
and
seized
the
hands
in
his
and
shook
them
wildly
glory
be
on
high
he
shouted
it
joe
louden

to
stay
a
while
ix
outer
darkness
if
any
echo
of
doubt
concerning
his
undesirable
conspicuousness
sounded
faintly
in
joe
mind
it
was
silenced
eftsoons
canaan
had
not
forgotten
him
far
from
it
so
far
that
it
began
pointing
him
out
to
strangers
on
the
street
the
very
day
of
his
return
his
course
of
action
likewise
that
of
his
friends
permitted
him
little
obscurity
and
when
the
rumors
of
his
finally
obtaining
lodging
at
beaver
beach
and
of
the
celebration
of
his
installation
there
were
presently
confirmed
he
stood
in
the
indeed
as
a
mephistopheles
upsprung
through
the
the
welcoming
festivities
had
not
been
so
discreetly
conducted
as
to
accord
with
the
general
policy
of
beaver
beach
an
unfortunate
incident
caused
the
arrest
of
one
of
the
celebrators
and
the
ambulancing
to
the
hospital
of
another
on
the
homeward
way
the
ensuing
proceedings
in
court
bringing
to
the
whole
affair
a
publicity
devoutly
unsought
for
mr
happy
fear
such
was
the
habitual
name
of
the
imprisoned
gentleman
had
to
bear
a
great
amount
of
harsh
criticism
for
injuring
a
companion
within
the
city
limits
after
daylight
and
for
failing
to
observe
that
three
policemen
were
not
too
distant
from
the
scene
of
operations
to
engage
therein
happy
if
ye
had
it
in
mind
to
harm
him
said
the
man
to
mr
fear
upon
the
latter
return
to
society
why
did
ye
do
it
out
here
at
the
beach
because
returned
the
indiscreet
he
did
say
what
he
was
goin
to
say
till
we
got
in
town
extraordinary
probing
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
had
developed
at
the
trial
that
the
obnoxious
speech
had
referred
to
the
guest
of
the
evening
the
assaulted
party
one
nashville
cory
was
not
of
canaan
but
a
bit
of
haply
touching
shore
for
the
moment
at
beaver
beach
and
strange
is
this
world
he
had
been
introduced
to
the
coterie
of
mike
place
by
happy
fear
himself
who
had
enjoyed
a
brief
acquaintance
with
him
on
a
day
when
both
had
chanced
to
travel
incognito
by
the
same
freight
naturally
happy
had
felt
responsible
for
the
proper
behavior
of
his
protege
was
in
fact
bound
to
enforce
it
additionally
happy
had
once
been
saved
from
a
term
of
imprisonment
at
a
time
when
it
would
have
been
more
than
ordinarily
inconvenient
by
help
and
advice
from
joe
and
he
was
not
one
to
forget
therefore
he
was
grieved
to
observe
that
his
own
guest
seemed
to
be
somewhat
jealous
of
the
hero
of
the
occasion
and
disposed
to
look
coldly
upon
him
the
stranger
however
contented
himself
with
innuendo
mere
expressions
of
the
face
and
other
manner
of
things
for
which
one
could
not
squarely
lay
hands
upon
him
until
such
time
as
he
and
his
sponsor
had
come
to
main
street
in
the
clear
dawn
on
their
way
to
happy
apartment
a
variable
abode
it
may
be
that
the
stranger
perceived
what
happy
did
not
the
three
bluecoats
in
the
perspective
at
all
events
he
now
put
into
words
of
simple
strength
the
unfavorable
conception
he
had
formed
of
joe
the
result
was
mediaevally
immediate
and
the
period
of
cory
convalescence
in
the
hospital
was
almost
half
that
of
his
sponsor
detention
in
the
county
jail
it
needed
nothing
to
finish
joe
with
the
good
people
of
canaan
had
it
needed
anything
the
trial
of
happy
fear
would
have
overspilled
the
necessity
an
item
of
the
testimony
was
that
joseph
louden
had
helped
to
carry
one
of
the
ladies
present
a
miss
le
roy
who
had
fainted
to
the
open
air
and
had
jostled
the
stranger
in
passing
after
this
the
oldest
woman
in
canaan
would
not
have
dared
to
speak
to
joe
on
the
street
even
if
she
wanted
to
unless
she
happened
to
be
very
poor
or
very
wicked
the
tocsin
printed
an
adequate
account
for
there
was
a
large
public
interest
recording
in
conclusion
that
louden
paid
the
culprit
fine
which
was
the
largest
in
the
power
of
the
presiding
judge
in
his
mercy
to
bestow
editorially
the
tocsin
leaned
to
the
facetious
louden
has
but
recently
to
our
midst
we
fervently
hope
that
the
distinguished
happy
fear
will
appreciate
his
patron
superb
generosity
we
say
patron
but
perhaps
we
err
in
this
were
it
not
better
to
figure
louden
as
the
lady
in
distress
mr
fear
as
the
champion
in
the
lists
in
the
present
case
however
contrary
to
the
rules
of
romance
the
champion
falls
in
duress
and
passes
to
the
dungeon
we
merely
suggest
en
passant
that
some
of
our
best
citizens
might
deem
it
a
wonderful
and
beauteous
thing
if
in
addition
to
paying
the
fine
louden
could
serve
for
the
loyal
happy
his
six
months
in
the
bastile
en
passant
if
nothing
else
would
have
revealed
to
joe
in
this
imitation
of
a
better
trick
the
hand
of
eugene
and
little
doubt
he
would
have
agreed
with
squire
buckalew
in
the
squire
answer
to
the
easily
expected
comment
of
arp
sometimes
said
eskew
i
think
that
bantry
is
jest
a
leetle
bit
spiderier
than
he
is
lazy
that
the
first
thing
he
written
in
the
tocsin
this
month
one
of
the
boys
over
there
told
me
he
wrote
it
out
of
spite
against
joe
but
he
ought
to
of
done
better
if
his
spite
had
run
away
with
what
mind
he
got
he
of
said
that
both
joe
louden
and
that
tramp
fear
ought
to
of
had
ten
years
bantry
did
write
that
out
of
spite
answered
buckalew
he
only
thought
he
saw
a
chance
to
be
kind
of
funny
and
please
judge
pike
the
judge
has
always
thought
joe
was
a
ai
he
right
cried
arp
do
say
he
ai
squire
buckalew
cast
a
glance
at
brown
the
clerk
and
perceiving
that
he
was
listening
added
the
judge
always
is
right
yes
sir
said
colonel
flitcroft
i
ca
stand
up
for
joe
louden
to
any
extent
but
i
do
think
he
done
wrong
buckalew
went
on
recovering
when
he
paid
this
man
fear
fine
you
do
exclaimed
arp
why
have
you
got
gumption
enough
to
see
look
here
eskew
interposed
his
antagonist
how
many
friends
have
you
got
that
hate
to
hear
folks
talk
bad
about
you
not
a
one
for
once
eskew
guard
was
down
and
his
consistency
led
him
to
destruction
not
a
one
it
ai
in
human
nature
bound
to
enjoy
it
got
any
friends
that
would
fight
for
you
eskew
walked
straight
into
this
hideous
trap
no
there
ai
a
dozen
men
ever
lived
that
had
caesar
was
a
popular
man
but
he
did
have
a
soul
to
help
him
when
the
crowd
lit
on
him
and
i
bet
old
mark
antony
was
mighty
glad
they
got
him
out
in
the
yard
before
it
happened
he
would
have
lifted
a
finger
without
a
gang
behind
him
why
all
peter
himself
could
do
was
to
cut
off
an
ear
that
was
no
use
to
anybody
what
are
you
tryin
to
get
at
the
squire
had
him
and
paused
and
stroked
his
chin
to
make
the
ruin
complete
then
i
reckon
you
have
to
admit
he
murmured
that
while
i
ai
defendin
joe
louden
character
it
was
kind
of
proper
for
him
to
stand
by
a
feller
that
would
hear
nothin
against
him
and
fought
for
him
as
soon
as
he
did
hear
it
eskew
arp
rose
from
his
chair
and
left
the
hotel
it
was
the
only
morning
in
all
the
days
of
the
conclave
when
he
was
the
first
to
leave
squire
buckalew
looked
after
the
retreating
figure
total
triumph
shining
brazenly
from
his
spectacles
i
expect
he
explained
modestly
to
the
others
i
expect
i
do
think
any
more
of
joe
louden
than
he
does
and
i
be
glad
when
canaan
sees
the
last
of
him
for
good
but
sometimes
the
temptation
to
argue
with
eskew
does
lead
me
on
to
kind
of
git
the
better
of
him
when
happy
fear
had
suffered
with
a
simplicity
of
patience
his
allotment
of
months
in
durance
and
was
released
and
sent
into
the
streets
and
sunshine
once
more
he
knew
that
his
first
duty
lay
in
the
direction
of
a
general
apology
to
joe
but
the
young
man
was
no
longer
at
beaver
beach
the
proprietor
dwelt
alone
there
and
receiving
happy
with
scorn
and
pity
directed
him
to
retrace
his
footsteps
to
the
town
ye
must
have
been
in
the
black
hole
of
incarceration
indeed
if
ye
have
heard
that
louden
has
his
on
the
square
and
his
behind
the
office
it
in
that
little
brick
straight
acrost
from
the
sheriff
door
o
the
jail
ye
been
neighbors
this
long
time
a
hard
time
the
boy
had
persuadin
any
one
to
rent
to
him
but
by
payin
double
the
price
he
got
a
place
at
last
he
a
practisin
lawyer
now
praise
the
lord
and
all
the
boys
and
girls
of
our
acquaintance
go
to
him
with
their
troubles
ye
see
him
with
a
murder
case
to
try
before
long
as
sure
as
ye
not
worth
yer
salt
but
i
expect
ye
can
still
call
him
by
his
name
of
joe
all
the
same
it
was
a
bleak
and
meagre
little
office
into
which
mr
fear
ushered
himself
to
offer
his
amends
the
cracked
plaster
of
the
walls
was
bare
save
for
dust
there
were
no
shelves
the
fat
brown
volumes
most
of
them
fairly
new
were
piled
in
regular
columns
upon
a
cheap
pine
table
there
was
but
one
window
and
shadeless
an
inner
door
of
this
sad
chamber
stood
half
ajar
permitting
the
visitor
unreserved
acquaintance
with
the
domestic
economy
of
the
tenant
for
it
disclosed
a
second
room
smaller
than
the
office
and
dependent
upon
the
window
of
the
latter
for
air
and
light
behind
a
canvas
dimly
visible
in
the
obscurity
of
the
inner
apartment
stood
a
small
surmounted
by
a
from
which
projected
the
handle
of
a
big
tin
spoon
so
that
it
needed
no
ghost
from
the
dead
to
whisper
that
joseph
louden
did
his
own
cooking
indeed
he
looked
it
upon
the
threshold
of
the
second
room
reposed
a
small
worn
of
a
dog
so
cosmopolitan
in
ancestry
that
his
species
was
almost
as
undeterminable
as
the
dogs
of
the
pike
mansion
he
greeted
mr
fear
hospitably
having
been
so
lately
an
offcast
of
the
streets
himself
that
his
adoption
had
taught
him
to
lose
only
his
old
tremors
not
his
hopefulness
at
the
same
time
joe
rose
quickly
from
the
deal
table
where
he
had
been
working
with
one
hand
in
his
hair
the
other
splattering
ink
from
a
bad
pen
good
for
you
happy
he
cried
cheerfully
i
hoped
you
come
to
see
me
i
been
thinking
about
a
job
for
you
what
kind
of
a
job
asked
the
visitor
as
they
shook
hands

need
one
bad

but
you
know
there
ai
nobody
in
canaan
would
gim
me
one
joe
joe
pushed
him
into
one
of
the
two
chairs
which
completed
the
furniture
of
his
office
yes
there
is
i
got
an
idea
first
broke
in
mr
fear
fingering
his
shapeless
hat
and
fixing
his
eyes
upon
it
with
embarrassment
first
lem
me
say
what
i
come
here
to
say
i
well
his
embarrassment
increased
and
he
paused

the
hat
between
his
hands
about
this
job
joe
began

interrupted
with
some
shortness
to
look
after
the
place

mean
these
two
rooms
there
a
stairway
too
joe
put
forth
quickly
it
would
be
any
sinecure
happy
you
earn
your
money
do
be
afraid
of
that
mr
fear
straightened
up
his
burden
of
embarrassment
gone
from
him
transferred
to
the
other
shoulders
there
always
was
a
yellow
streak
in
you
joe
he
said
firmly
you

good
as
a
liar
except
when
you

lot

janitor

had
no
business
to
pay
my
fine
you

tryin
to

but
i
said
what
i

and
i
say
one
thing
more
do
you
worry
about
gittin
law
practice
mike
says
you
goin
to
git
all
you
want
and
if
there
ai
no
other
way
why
a
few
of
us
go
out
and
make
some
fer
ye
these
prophecies
and
promises
over
which
joe
chuckled
at
first
with
his
head
cocked
to
one
side
grew
very
soon
to
his
amazement
to
wear
a
supernatural
similarity
to
actual
fulfilment
his
friends
brought
him
their
own
friends
such
as
had
sinned
against
the
laws
of
canaan
those
under
the
ban
of
the
sheriff
those
who
had
struck
in
anger
those
who
had
stolen
at
night
those
who
owed
and
could
not
pay
those
who
lived
by
the
dice
and
to
his
other
titles
to
notoriety
was
added
that
of
defender
of
the
poor
and
wicked
he
found
his
hands
full
especially
after
winning
his
first
important
case
on
which
occasion
canaan
thought
the
jury
mad
and
was
indignant
with
the
puzzled
judge
who
could
not
see
just
how
it
had
happened
joe
did
not
stop
at
that
he
kept
on
winning
cases
clearing
the
innocent
and
lightening
the
burdens
of
the
guilty
he
became
the
most
dangerous
attorney
for
the
defence
in
canaan
his
honorable
brethren
accepting
the
popular
view
of
him
held
him
in
personal
contempt
but
feared
him
professionally
for
he
proved
that
he
knew
more
law
than
they
thought
existed
nor
could
any
trick
him
failing
which
many
tempers
were
lost
but
never
joe
his
practice
was
not
all
criminal
as
shown
by
the
peevish
outburst
of
the
eminent
buckalew
the
nephew
esteemed
the
foremost
lawyer
in
canaan
before
long
there
wo
be
any
use
trying
to
foreclose
a
mortgage
or
collect
a
note
unless
this
shyster
gets
himself
in
jail
the
wrath
of
judge
martin
pike
was
august
there
was
a
kind
of
sublimity
in
its
immenseness
on
a
day
when
it
befell
that
the
shyster
stood
betwixt
him
and
money
that
was
a
monstrous
task
to
stand
between
these
two
and
separate
them
to
hold
back
the
hand
of
martin
pike
from
what
it
had
reached
out
to
grasp
it
was
in
the
matter
of
some
which
the
magnate
had
acquired
and
in
court
joe
treated
the
case
with
such
horrifying
simplicity
that
it
seemed
almost
credible
that
the
great
man
had
counted
upon
the
ignorance
and
besottedness
of
joe
client
a
disreputable
old
farmer
to
get
his
land
away
from
him
without
paying
for
it
now
as
every
one
knew
such
a
thing
to
be
ludicrously
impossible
it
was
at
once
noised
abroad
in
canaan
that
joe
had
helped
to
swindle
judge
pike
out
of
a
large
sum
of
money
it
was
notorious
that
the
shyster
could
bamboozle
court
and
jury
with
his
tricks
and
it
was
felt
that
joe
louden
was
getting
into
very
deep
waters
indeed
this
was
serious
if
the
young
man
did
not
look
out
he
might
find
himself
in
the
penitentiary
the
tocsin
paragraphed
him
with
a
fine
regularity
after
this
usually
opening
with
a
gravity
the
time
has
come
when
we
must
speak
of
a
certain
matter
frankly
or
at
last
the
time
has
arrived
when
the
demoralization
of
the
bar
caused
by
a
certain
criminal
lawyer
must
be
dealt
with
as
it
is
and
without
gloves
once
when
joe
had
saved
a
negro
from
the
extreme
penalty
for
murder
the
tocsin
had
declared
with
great
originality
this
is
just
the
kind
of
thing
that
causes
mobs
and
justifies
them
if
we
are
to
continue
to
permit
the
worst
class
of
malefactors
to
escape
the
consequences
of
their
crimes
through
the
unwholesome
dexterities
and
the
shifty
manipulations
and
technicalities
of
a
certain
criminal
lawyer
the
time
will
come
when
an
outraged
citizenry
may
take
the
enforcement
of
the
law
in
its
own
hands
let
us
call
a
spade
a
spade
if
canaan
streets
ever
echo
with
the
tread
of
a
mob
the
fault
lies
upon
the
head
of
joseph
louden
who
has
once
more
brought
about
a
miscarriage
of
justice
joe
did
not
move
into
a
larger
office
he
remained
in
the
little
room
with
its
one
window
and
its
fine
view
of
the
jail
his
clients
were
nearly
all
poor
and
many
of
his
fees
quite
literally
nominal
tatters
and
rags
came
up
the
narrow
stairway
to
his
door
tatters
and
rags
and
pitiful
fineries
the
bleared
the
sodden
the
flaunting
and
rouged
the
furtive
and
wary
some
in
rags
some
in
tags
and
some
the
sorriest
in
velvet
gowns
with
these
the
distressed
the
the
drunken
the
dirty
and
the
very
poor
his
work
lay
and
his
days
and
nights
were
spent
ariel
had
told
roger
tabor
that
in
time
joe
might
come
to
be
what
the
town
thought
him
if
it
gave
him
no
other
chance
only
its
dinginess
and
evil
surrounded
him
no
respectable
house
was
open
to
him
the
barrooms
except
that
of
the
national
house
welcomed
him
gratefully
and
admiringly
once
he
went
to
church
on
a
pleasant
morning
when
nice
girls
wear
pretty
spring
dresses
it
gave
him
a
thrill
of
delight
to
see
them
to
be
near
clean
good
people
once
more
inadvertently
he
took
a
seat
by
his
who
rose
with
a
slight
rustle
of
silk
and
moved
to
another
pew
and
it
happened
additionally
that
this
was
the
morning
that
the
minister
fired
by
the
tocsin
warnings
had
chosen
to
preach
on
the
subject
of
joe
himself
the
outcast
returned
to
his
own
kind
no
lady
spoke
to
him
upon
the
street
mamie
pike
had
passed
him
with
averted
eyes
since
her
first
meeting
with
him
but
the
shunning
and
snubbing
of
a
young
man
by
a
pretty
girl
have
never
yet
if
done
in
a
certain
way
prevented
him
from
continuing
to
be
in
love
with
her
mamie
did
it
in
the
certain
way
joe
did
not
wince
therefore
it
hurt
all
the
more
for
blows
from
which
one
cringes
lose
much
of
their
force
the
town
dog
had
been
given
a
bad
name
painted
solid
black
from
head
to
heel
he
was
a
storm
centre
of
scandal
the
entrance
to
his
dingy
stairway
was
in
square
view
of
the
national
house
and
the
result
is
imaginable
how
many
of
joe
clients
especially
those
sorriest
of
the
velvet
gowns
were
conjectured
to
ascend
his
stairs
for
reasons
more
convivial
than
legal
yes
he
lived
with
his
own
kind
and
so
far
as
the
rest
of
canaan
was
concerned
might
as
well
have
worn
the
scarlet
letter
on
his
breast
or
branded
on
his
forehead
when
he
went
about
the
streets
he
was
made
to
feel
his
condition
by
the
elaborate
avoidance
yet
furtive
attention
of
every
respectable
person
he
met
and
when
he
came
home
to
his
small
rooms
and
shut
the
door
behind
him
he
was
as
one
who
has
been
hissed
and
shamed
in
public
and
runs
to
bury
his
hot
face
in
his
pillow
he
petted
his
mongrel
extravagantly
well
he
might
and
would
sit
with
him
in
his
rooms
at
night
holding
long
converse
with
him
the
two
alone
together
the
dog
was
not
his
only
confidant
there
came
to
be
another
a
more
and
more
frequent
partner
to
their
conversations
at
last
a
familiar
spirit
this
third
came
from
a
brown
jug
which
joe
kept
on
a
shelf
in
his
bedroom
a
vessel
too
frequently
replenished
when
the
day
work
was
done
he
shut
himself
up
drank
alone
and
drank
hard
sometimes
when
the
jug
ran
low
and
the
night
was
late
he
would
go
out
for
a
walk
with
his
dog
and
would
awake
in
his
room
the
next
morning
not
remembering
where
he
had
gone
or
how
he
had
come
home
once
after
such
a
lapse
of
memory
he
woke
amazed
to
find
himself
at
beaver
beach
whither
he
learned
from
the
man
happy
fear
had
brought
him
having
found
him
wandering
dazedly
in
a
field
near
by
these
lapses
grew
more
frequent
until
there
occurred
that
which
was
one
of
the
strange
things
of
his
life
it
was
a
june
night
a
little
more
than
two
years
after
his
return
to
canaan
and
the
tocsin
had
that
day
announced
the
approaching
marriage
of
eugene
bantry
and
his
employer
daughter
joe
ate
nothing
during
the
day
and
went
through
his
work
clumsily
visiting
the
bedroom
shelf
at
intervals
at
ten
in
the
evening
he
went
out
to
have
the
jug
refilled
but
from
the
moment
he
left
his
door
and
the
fresh
air
struck
his
face
he
had
no
clear
knowledge
of
what
he
did
or
of
what
went
on
about
him
until
he
woke
in
his
bed
the
next
morning
and
yet
whatever
little
part
of
the
soul
of
him
remained
that
night
still
undulled
not
numbed
but
alive
was
in
some
strange
manner
lifted
out
of
its
pain
towards
a
strange
delight
his
body
was
an
automaton
his
mind
in
bondage
yet
there
was
a
still
small
consciousness
in
him
which
knew
that
in
his
wandering
something
incredible
and
unexpected
was
happening
what
this
was
he
did
not
know
could
not
see
though
his
eyes
were
open
could
not
have
told
himself
any
more
than
a
baby
could
tell
why
it
laughs
but
it
seemed
something
so
beautiful
and
wonderful
that
the
night
became
a
night
of
perfume
its
breezes
bearing
the
music
of
harps
and
violins
while
nightingales
sang
from
the
maples
that
bordered
the
streets
of
canaan
x
the
tryst
he
woke
to
the
light
of
morning
amazed
and
full
of
a
strange
wonder
because
he
did
not
know
what
had
amazed
him
for
a
little
while
after
his
eyes
opened
he
lay
quite
motionless
then
he
lifted
his
head
slightly
and
shook
it
with
some
caution
this
had
come
to
be
custom
the
operation
assured
him
of
the
worst
the
room
swam
round
him
and
with
a
faint
groan
he
let
his
head
fall
back
upon
the
pillow
but
he
could
not
sleep
again
pain
stung
its
way
through
his
heart
as
memory
began
to
come
back
to
him
not
of
the
preceding
night
that
was
all
blank
but
realization
that
the
girl
of
whom
he
had
dreamed
so
long
was
to
be
married
that
his
dreams
had
been
quite
hopeless
was
no
balm
to
his
hurt
a
chime
of
bells
sounded
from
a
church
steeple
across
the
square
ringing
out
in
assured
righteousness
summoning
the
good
people
who
maintained
them
to
come
and
sit
beneath
them
or
be
taken
to
task
and
they
fell
so
dismally
upon
joe
ear
that
he
bestirred
himself
and
rose
to
the
delight
of
his
mongrel
who
leaped
upon
him
joyfully
an
hour
later
or
thereabout
the
pair
emerged
from
the
narrow
stairway
and
stood
for
a
moment
blinking
in
the
fair
sunshine
apparently
undecided
which
way
to
go
the
church
bells
were
silent
there
was
no
breeze
the
air
trembled
a
little
with
the
deep
pipings
of
the
organ
across
the
square
and
save
for
that
the
town
was
very
quiet
the
paths
which
crossed
the
yard
were
flecked
with
steady
shadow
the
strong
young
foliage
of
the
maples
not
moving
having
the
air
of
observing
the
sabbath
with
propriety
there
were
benches
here
and
there
along
the
walks
and
to
one
of
these
joe
crossed
and
sat
down
the
mongrel
at
his
master
feet
rolled
on
his
back
in
morning
ecstasy
ceased
abruptly
to
roll
and
began
to
scratch
his
ear
with
a
hind
foot
intently
a
tiny
hand
stretched
to
pat
his
head
and
the
dog
licked
it
appreciatively
it
belonged
to
a
young
lady
of
six
in
starchy
white
frills
and
new
pink
ribbons
who
had
run
ahead
of
her
mother
a
belated
and
the
mongrel
charmed
her
will
you
give
me
this
dog
she
asked
without
any
tedious
formalities
involuntarily
she
departed
before
receiving
a
reply
the
mother
a
matron
whom
joe
recognized
as
a
sister
of
louden
consequently
his
swooped
at
the
child
with
a
rush
and
rustle
of
silk
and
bore
her
on
violently
to
her
duty
when
they
had
gone
a
little
way
the
matron
voice
was
heard
in
sharp
reproof
the
child
held
by
one
wrist
and
hurried
along
on
tiptoe
staring
back
over
one
shoulder
at
joe
her
eyes
wide
and
her
mouth
the
shape
of
the
o
she
was
ejaculating
the
dog
looked
up
with
wistful
inquiry
at
his
master
who
cocked
an
eyebrow
at
him
in
return
wearing
much
the
same
expression
the
mother
and
child
disappeared
within
the
church
doors
and
left
the
square
to
the
two
even
the
hotel
showed
no
signs
of
life
for
the
wise
men
were
not
allowed
to
foregather
on
sundays
the
organ
had
ceased
to
stir
the
air
and
all
was
in
quiet
yet
a
quiet
which
for
louden
was
not
peace
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
without
intending
it
spoke
the
hour
aloud
a
quarter
past
eleven
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
gave
him
a
little
shock
he
rose
without
knowing
why
and
as
he
did
so
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
close
to
his
ear
another
voice
a
woman
troubled
and
insistent
but
clear
and
sweet
saying
remember
across
main
street
bridge
at
noon
it
was
so
distinct
that
he
started
and
looked
round
then
he
laughed
i
be
seeing
circus
parades
next
his
laughter
fled
for
louder
than
the
ringing
in
his
ears
unmistakably
came
the
strains
of
a
brass
band
which
had
no
existence
on
land
or
sea
or
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
here
he
said
to
the
mongrel
we
need
a
walk
i
think
let
you
and
me
move
on
before
the
camels
turn
the
corner
the
music
followed
him
to
the
street
where
he
turned
westward
toward
the
river
and
presently
as
he
walked
on
fanning
himself
with
his
straw
hat
it
faded
and
was
gone
but
the
voice
he
had
heard
returned
remember
across
main
street
bridge
at
noon
it
said
again
close
to
his
ear
this
time
he
did
not
start
all
right
he
answered
wiping
his
forehead
if
you
let
me
alone
i
be
there
at
a
dingy
saloon
corner
near
the
river
a
shabby
little
man
greeted
him
heartily
and
petted
the
mongrel
i
mighty
glad
you
did
go
after
all
joe
he
added
with
a
brightening
face
go
where
happy
mr
fear
looked
grave
do
you
meetin
me
last
night
louden
shook
his
head

and
his
brow
corrugated
with

head
seriously

joe

he
began
slowly
then
paused
and
shook
his
head
again
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
delivering
some
advice
but
evidently
perceiving
the
snobbishness
of
such
a
proceeding
or
else
convinced
by
his
own
experience
of
the
futility
of
it
he
swerved
to
cheerfulness
i
hear
the
boys

all
goin
to
work
hard
fer
the
primaries

happy
that

kind
of
thing
i
used
to

when
i

off
with
a
tired
laugh
tell
them
not
to
waste
their
time

going
out
to
the
beach
this
afternoon
the
little
man
lowered
his
eyes
moodily
i

near
there
he
said
scraping
his
patched
shoe
up
and
down
the
curbstone

wearily
over
his
aching
forehead

said
and

of
course

always
a
crowd
there
on
sundays
is
it
hard
for
you
to
see
why

doing
it
it
because
he
wants
to
make
you
jealous

so
that

him
again
and
why
does
he
want

because
he
ready

the
other
eyes
suddenly
became
bloodshot
his
nostrils
expanding
incredibly
ready

that
enough
joe
interrupted
swiftly
we

no
talk
like

settle
this
for
you

you
send
word
to
claudine
that
i
want
to

beach

word
mr
fear
expression
softened
all
right
joe
he
said
i
do
whatever
you
tell
me
to
any
of
us
do
that
we
sure
know
who
our
friend
keep
out
of
trouble
happy
joe
turned
to
go
and
they
shook
hands
good
day
and
keep
out
of
trouble
when
he
had
gone
mr
fear
countenance
again
gloomed
ominously
and
shaking
his
head
he
ruminatively
entered
an
adjacent
bar
through
the
alley
door
the
main
street
bridge
was
an
wooden
covered
one
and
very
narrow
squarely
framing
the
fair
open
country
beyond
for
the
town
had
never
crossed
the
river
joe
found
the
cool
shadow
in
the
bridge
gracious
to
his
hot
brow
and
through
the
slender
chinks
of
the
worn
flooring
he
caught
bright
glimpses
of
running
water
when
he
came
out
of
the
other
end
he
felt
enough
refreshed
to
light
a
cigar
well
here
i
am
he
said
across
main
street
bridge
and
it
must
be
getting
on
toward
noon
he
spoke
almost
with
the
aspect
of
daring
and
immediately
stood
still
listening
he
ventured
to
repeat
again
daring
across
main
street
bridge
at
noon
and
again
he
listened
then
he
chuckled
faintly
with
relief
for
the
voice
did
not
return
thank
god
i
got
rid
of
that
he
whispered
and
of
the
circus
band
too
a
dust
road
turned
to
the
right
following
the
river
and
shaded
by
big
sycamores
on
the
bank
the
mongrel
intensely
preoccupied
with
this
road
scampered
away
his
nose
to
the
ground
good
enough
said
the
master
lead
on
and
i
come
after
you
but
he
had
not
far
to
follow
the
chase
led
him
to
a
log
which
lay
on
a
low
levee
above
the
stream
where
the
interest
in
the
pursuit
became
vivid
temporarily
however
for
after
a
few
minutes
of
agitated
investigation
he
was
seized
with
indifference
to
the
whole
world
panted
briefly
slept
joe
sat
upon
the
log
which
was
in
the
shade
and
smoked
he
tried
it
once
more
main
street
bridge
at
noon
safety
still
the
voice
came
not
but
the
sound
of
his
own
repetition
of
the
words
brought
him
an
eerie
tremor
for
the
mist
of
a
memory
came
with
it
nothing
tangible
nothing
definite
but
something
very
far
away
and
shadowy
yet
just
poignant
enough
to
give
him
a
queer
feeling
that
he
was
really
keeping
an
appointment
here
was
it
with
some
that
would
rise
from
the
river
was
it
with
a
dryad
of
the
sycamores
he
knew
too
well
that
he
might
expect
strange
fancies
to
get
hold
of
him
this
morning
and
as
this
one
grew
uncannily
stronger
he
moved
his
head
briskly
as
if
to
shake
it
off
the
result
surprised
him
the
fancy
remained
but
his
headache
and
dizziness
had
left
him
a
breeze
wandered
up
the
river
and
touched
the
leaves
and
grass
to
life
sparrows
hopped
and
chirped
in
the
branches
absurdly
surprised
without
doubt
having
concluded
in
the
sunday
stillness
that
the
world
would
drowse
forever
and
the
mongrel
lifted
his
head
blinked
at
them
hopelessly
wishing
they
would
alight
near
him
scratched
his
ear
with
the
manner
of
one
who
has
neglected
such
matters
overlong
reversed
his
position
slept
again
the
young
corn
deep
green
in
the
bottomland
moved
with
a
staccato
flurry
and
the
dust
ghost
of
a
mad
whirling
dervish
sped
up
the
main
road
to
vanish
at
the
bridge
in
a
climax
of
lunacy
the
stirring
air
brought
a
smell
of
blossoms
the
distance
took
on
faint
lavender
hazes
which
blended
the
outlines
of
the
fields
lying
like
square
coverlets
upon
the
long
slope
of
rising
ground
beyond
the
and
empurpled
the
blue
woodland
shadows
of
the
groves
for
the
first
time
it
struck
joe
that
it
was
a
beautiful
day
and
it
came
to
him
that
a
beautiful
day
was
a
thing
which
nothing
except
death
sickness
or
imprisonment
could
take
from
him
not
even
the
ban
of
canaan
unforewarned
music
sounded
in
his
ears
again
but
he
did
not
shrink
from
it
now
this
was
not
the
circus
band
he
had
heard
as
he
left
the
square
but
a
melody
like
a
serenade
at
night
as
of
the
horns
of
faintly
blowing
and
he
closed
his
eyes
with
the
sweetness
of
it
go
ahead
he
whispered
do
that
all
you
want
to
if
you
keep
it
up
like
this
awhile
i
follow
with
brown
jug
how
i
love
thee
it
seems
to
pay
after
all
the
welcome
strains
however
were
but
the
prelude
to
a
harsher
sound
which
interrupted
and
annihilated
them
the
bell
clanging
out
twelve
all
right
said
joe
it
noon
and
i
main
street
bridge
he
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
about
him
whimsically
then
he
shook
his
head
again
a
lady
had
just
emerged
from
the
bridge
and
was
coming
toward
him
it
would
be
hard
to
get
at
joe
first
impressions
of
her
we
can
find
conveyance
for
only
the
broadest
and
heaviest
ancient
and
modern
instances
multiply
the
case
of
the
sleeper
who
dreams
out
a
long
story
in
accurate
color
and
fine
detail
a
tale
of
years
in
the
opening
and
shutting
of
a
door
so
with
joseph
in
the
brief
space
of
the
approach
and
with
him
as
with
the
sleeper
it
must
have
been
in
fact
it
was
in
his
recollections
later
a
blur
of
emotion
at
first
sight
of
her
perhaps
it
was
the
shock
of
seeing
anything
so
exquisite
where
he
had
expected
to
see
nothing
at
all
for
she
was
exquisite
horrid
as
have
been
the
uses
of
the
word
its
best
and
truest
belong
to
her
she
was
that
and
much
more
from
the
ivory
ferrule
of
the
parasol
she
carried
to
the
light
and
slender
footprint
she
left
in
the
dust
of
the
road
joe
knew
at
once
that
nothing
like
her
had
ever
before
been
seen
in
canaan
he
had
little
knowledge
of
the
millinery
arts
and
he
needed
none
to
see
the
harmony
harmony
like
that
of
the
day
he
had
discovered
a
little
while
ago
her
dress
and
hat
and
gloves
and
parasol
showed
a
pale
lavender
overtint
like
that
which
he
had
seen
overspreading
the
western
slope
afterward
he
discovered
that
the
gloves
she
wore
that
day
were
gray
and
that
her
hat
was
for
the
most
part
white
the
charm
of
fabric
and
tint
belonging
to
what
she
wore
was
no
shame
to
her
not
being
of
primal
importance
beyond
herself
it
was
but
the
expression
of
her
daintiness
and
the
adjunct
of
it
she
was
tall
but
if
joe
could
have
spoken
or
thought
of
her
as
slender
he
would
have
been
capable
of
calling
her
lips
red
in
which
case
he
would
not
have
been
joe
and
would
have
been
as
far
from
the
truth
as
her
lips
were
from
red
or
as
her
supreme
delicateness
was
from
mere
slenderness
under
the
summer
hat
her
very
dark
hair
swept
back
over
her
temples
with
something
near
trimness
in
the
extent
to
which
it
was
withheld
from
being
fluffy
it
may
be
that
this
approach
to
trimness
which
was
after
all
only
a
sort
of
coquetry
with
trimness
is
the
true
key
to
the
mystery
of
the
vision
of
the
lady
who
appeared
to
joe
let
us
say
that
she
suppressed
everything
that
went
beyond
grace
that
the
hint
of
floridity
was
abhorrent
to
her
trim
is
as
clumsy
as
slender
she
had
escaped
from
the
trimness
of
girlhood
as
wholly
as
she
had
gone
through
its
coltishness
exquisite
let
us
go
back
to
joe
own
blurred
first
thought
of
her
and
be
content
with
that
she
was
to
pass
him
so
he
thought
and
as
she
drew
nearer
his
breath
came
faster
remember
across
main
street
bridge
at
noon
was
this
the
fay
of
whom
the
voice
had
warned
him
with
that
there
befell
him
the
mystery
of
last
night
he
did
not
remember
but
it
was
as
if
he
lived
again
dimly
the
highest
hour
of
happiness
in
a
life
a
thousand
years
ago
perfume
and
music
roses
nightingales
and
plucked
yes
something
wonderful
was
happening
to
him
she
had
stopped
directly
in
front
of
him
stopped
and
stood
looking
at
him
with
her
clear
eyes
he
did
not
lift
his
own
to
hers
he
had
long
experience
of
the
averted
gaze
of
women
but
it
was
not
only
that
a
great
shyness
beset
him
he
had
risen
and
removed
his
hat
trying
ineffectually
not
to
clear
his
throat
his
sense
urging
upon
him
that
she
was
a
stranger
in
canaan
who
had
lost
her
way
the
preposterousness
of
any
one
losing
the
way
in
canaan
not
just
now
appealing
to
his
every
day
sense
can
i
can
i
he
stammered
blushing
miserably
meaning
to
finish
with
direct
you
or
show
you
the
way
then
he
looked
at
her
again
and
saw
what
seemed
to
him
the
strangest
sight
of
his
life
the
lady
eyes
had
filled
with
tears
filled
and
overfilled
i
sit
here
on
the
log
with
you
she
said
and
her
voice
was
the
voice
which
he
had
heard
saying
remember
across
main
street
bridge
at
noon
what
he
gasped
you
do
need
to
dust
it
she
went
on
tremulously
and
even
then
he
did
not
know
who
she
was
xi
when
go
there
was
a
silence
for
if
the
dazzled
young
man
could
have
spoken
at
all
he
could
have
found
nothing
to
say
and
perhaps
the
lady
would
not
trust
her
own
voice
just
then
his
eyes
had
fallen
again
he
was
too
dazed
and
in
truth
too
now
to
look
at
her
though
if
he
had
been
quite
sure
that
she
was
part
of
a
wonderful
dream
he
might
have
dared
she
was
seated
beside
him
and
had
handed
him
her
parasol
in
a
little
way
which
seemed
to
imply
that
of
course
he
had
reached
for
it
so
that
it
was
to
be
seen
how
used
she
was
to
have
all
tiny
things
done
for
her
though
this
was
not
then
of
his
tremulous
observing
he
did
perceive
however
that
he
was
to
furl
the
dainty
thing
he
pressed
the
catch
and
let
down
the
top
timidly
as
if
fearing
to
break
or
tear
it
and
as
it
closed
held
near
his
face
he
caught
a
very
faint
sweet
spicy
emanation
from
it
like
wild
roses
and
cinnamon
he
did
not
know
her
but
his
timidity
and
a
strange
little
choke
in
his
throat
the
sudden
fright
which
had
seized
upon
him
were
not
caused
by
embarrassment
he
had
no
thought
that
she
was
one
he
had
known
but
could
not
for
the
moment
recall
there
was
nothing
of
the
awkwardness
of
that
no
he
was
overpowered
by
the
miracle
of
this
meeting
and
yet
white
with
marvelling
he
felt
it
to
be
so
much
more
touchingly
a
great
happiness
than
he
had
ever
known
that
at
first
it
was
inexpressibly
sad
at
last
he
heard
her
voice
again
shaking
a
little
as
she
said
i
am
glad
you
remembered
remembered
what
he
faltered
then
you
do
she
cried
and
yet
you
came
came
here
do
you
mean
yes
now
at
noon
ah
he
half
whispered
unable
to
speak
aloud
was
it
you
who
said
who
said
across
across
main
street
bridge
at
noon
she
finished
for
him
gently
yes
he
took
a
deep
breath
in
the
wonder
of
it
where
was
it
you
said
that
he
asked
slowly
was
it
last
night
do
you
even
know
that
you
came
to
meet
me
came
to
to
meet
you
she
gave
a
little
pitying
cry
very
near
a
sob
seeing
his
utter
bewilderment
it
was
like
the
strangest
dream
in
the
world
she
said
you
were
at
the
station
when
i
came
last
night
you
do
remember
at
all
his
eyes
downcast
his
face
burning
hotly
he
could
only
shake
his
head
yes
she
continued
i
thought
no
one
would
be
there
for
i
had
not
written
to
say
what
train
i
should
take
but
when
i
stepped
down
from
the
platform
you
were
standing
there
though
you
did
see
me
at
first
not
until
i
had
called
your
name
and
ran
to
you
you
said
come
to
meet
you
but
you
said
it
queerly
i
thought
and
then
you
called
a
carriage
for
me
but
you
seemed
so
strange
you
tell
how
you
knew
that
i
was
coming
and
and
then
i
i
understood
you
were
yourself
you
were
very
quiet
but
i
knew
i
knew
so
i
made
you
get
into
the
carriage
and
and
she
faltered
to
a
stop
and
with
that
shame
itself
brought
him
courage
he
turned
and
faced
her
she
had
lifted
her
handkerchief
to
her
eyes
but
at
his
movement
she
dropped
it
and
it
was
not
so
much
the
delicate
loveliness
of
her
face
that
he
saw
then
as
the
tears
upon
her
cheeks
ah
poor
boy
she
cried
i
knew
i
knew
you
you
took
me
home
you
told
me
where
you
lived
she
answered
yes
i
took
you
home
i
do
understand
he
stammered
huskily
i
do
understand
she
leaned
toward
him
slightly
looking
at
him
with
great
intentness
you
did
know
me
last
night
she
said
do
you
know
me
now
for
answer
he
could
only
stare
at
her
dumfounded
he
lifted
an
unsteady
hand
toward
her
appealingly
but
the
manner
of
the
lady
as
she
saw
the
truth
underwent
an
april
change
she
drew
back
lightly
he
was
favored
with
the
most
delicious
low
laugh
he
had
ever
heard
and
by
some
magic
whisk
which
she
accomplished
there
was
no
sign
of
tears
about
her
ah
i
glad
you
the
same
joe
she
said
you
never
would
or
could
pretend
very
well
i
glad
you
the
same
and
i
glad
changed
though
that
is
why
you
have
forgotten
me
you
forgotten
me
because
you
never
thought
of
me
perhaps
i
should
not
have
known
you
if
you
had
changed
a
great
deal
as
i
have
he
started
leaning
back
from
her
ah
she
laughed
that
it
that
funny
little
twist
of
the
head
you
always
had
like
a
like
a
well
you
know
i
must
have
told
you
a
thousand
times
that
it
was
like
a
nice
friendly
puppy
so
why
i
say
so
now
and
your
eyebrows
when
you
look
like
that
nobody
could
ever
forget
you
joe
he
rose
from
the
log
and
the
mongrel
leaped
upon
him
uproariously
thinking
they
were
to
go
home
belike
to
food
the
lady
laughed
again
do
let
him
spoil
my
parasol
and
i
must
warn
you
now
never
never
tread
on
my
skirt
i
very
irritable
about
such
things
he
had
taken
three
or
four
uncertain
backward
steps
from
her
she
sat
before
him
radiant
with
laughter
the
loveliest
creature
he
had
ever
seen
but
between
him
and
this
charming
vision
there
swept
through
the
warm
scented
june
air
a
veil
of
snow
like
a
driven
fog
and
half
obscured
in
the
heart
of
it
a
young
girl
stood
in
a
drift
piled
against
an
old
picket
gate
her
black
and
shabby
skirt
flapping
in
the
blizzard
like
torn
sails
one
of
her
hands
toward
him
her
startled
eyes
fixed
on
his
and
oh
how
like
you
said
the
lady
how
like
you
and
nobody
else
in
the
world
joe
to
have
a
yellow
dog
ariel
tabor
his
lips
formed
the
words
without
sound
is
it
about
time
she
said
are
strange
ladies
in
the
habit
of
descending
from
trains
to
take
you
home
once
upon
a
white
morning
long
ago
the
sensational
progress
of
a
certain
youth
up
main
street
had
stirred
canaan
but
that
day
was
as
nothing
to
this
bantry
had
left
temporary
paralysis
in
his
wake
but
in
the
case
of
the
two
young
people
who
passed
slowly
along
the
street
it
was
petrifaction
which
seemingly
threatened
in
several
instances
most
notably
that
of
arp
to
become
permanent
the
lower
portion
of
the
street
lined
with
three
and
four
story
buildings
of
brick
and
stone
rather
grim
and
hot
facades
under
the
sun
afforded
little
shade
to
the
who
were
working
homeward
in
processional
little
groups
and
clumps
none
walking
fast
though
none
with
the
appearance
of
great
leisure
since
neither
rate
of
progress
would
have
been
esteemed
befitting
the
day
the
growth
of
canaan
steady
though
never
startling
had
left
almost
all
of
the
churches
and
main
street
the
principal
avenue
of
communication
between
them
and
the
residence
section
so
the
intermittent
procession
stretched
along
the
new
cement
from
a
little
below
the
square
to
upper
main
street
where
maples
lined
the
thoroughfare
and
the
mansions
of
the
affluent
stood
among
pleasant
lawns
and
shrubberies
it
was
late
for
this
had
been
a
communion
sunday
and
those
far
in
advance
who
had
already
reached
the
pretty
and
shady
part
of
the
street
were
members
of
the
churches
where
services
had
been
shortest
though
few
in
the
long
parade
looked
as
if
they
had
been
attending
anything
very
short
and
many
heads
of
families
were
crisp
in
their
replies
to
the
theological
inquiries
of
their
offspring
the
men
imparted
largely
a
gloom
to
the
itinerant
concourse
most
of
them
wearing
hot
long
black
coats
and
having
wilted
their
collars
the
ladies
relieving
this
gloom
somewhat
by
the
lighter
tints
of
their
garments
the
little
girls
relieving
it
greatly
by
their
white
dresses
and
their
faces
the
latter
bright
with
the
hope
of
sunday
while
the
boys
experiencing
some
solace
in
that
they
were
finally
out
where
a
person
could
at
least
scratch
himself
if
he
had
to
yet
oppressed
by
the
decorous
necessities
of
the
day
marched
along
furtively
planning
behind
imperturbably
secretive
countenances
various
means
for
the
later
dispersal
of
an
odious
monotony
usually
the
conversation
of
this
long
string
of
the
was
not
too
frivolous
or
worldly
nay
it
properly
inclined
to
discussion
of
the
sermon
that
is
praise
of
the
sermon
with
here
and
there
a
mild
or
so
and
its
lighter
aspects
were
apt
to
concern
the
next
social
or
various
pleasurable
schemes
for
the
raising
of
funds
to
help
the
heathen
the
quite
worthy
poor
or
the
church
this
was
the
serious
and
seemly
parade
the
propriety
of
whose
behavior
was
almost
disintegrated
when
the
lady
of
the
bridge
walked
up
the
street
in
the
shadow
of
a
lacy
lavender
parasol
carried
by
joseph
louden
the
congregation
of
the
church
across
the
square
that
to
which
joe
had
been
late
was
just
debouching
almost
in
mass
upon
main
street
when
these
two
went
by
it
is
not
quite
the
truth
to
say
that
all
except
the
children
came
to
a
dead
halt
but
it
is
not
very
far
from
it
the
air
was
thick
with
subdued
exclamations
and
whisperings
here
is
no
mystery
joe
was
probably
the
only
person
of
respectable
derivation
in
canaan
who
had
not
known
for
weeks
that
ariel
tabor
was
on
her
way
home
and
the
news
that
she
had
arrived
the
night
before
had
been
widely
disseminated
on
the
way
to
church
entering
church
in
church
even
so
and
coming
out
of
church
an
account
of
her
house
in
the
avenue
henri
martin
and
of
her
portrait
in
the
salon
a
mysterious
business
to
many
and
not
lacking
in
grandeur
for
that
had
occupied
two
columns
in
the
tocsin
on
a
day
some
months
before
when
joe
had
found
himself
inimically
on
the
first
page
and
had
dropped
the
paper
without
reading
further
ariel
name
had
been
in
the
mouth
of
canaan
for
a
long
time
unfortunately
for
joe
however
not
in
the
mouth
of
that
canaan
which
held
converse
with
him
joe
had
not
known
her
the
women
recognized
her
infallibly
at
first
glance
even
those
who
had
quite
forgotten
her
and
the
women
told
their
men
hence
the
demeanor
of
the
procession
for
few
towns
hold
it
more
unseemly
to
stand
and
stare
at
especially
on
the
but
ariel
tabor
returned
and
walking
with
with
joe
louden
a
low
but
increasing
murmur
followed
the
two
as
they
proceeded
it
ran
up
the
street
ahead
of
them
people
turned
to
look
back
and
paused
so
that
they
had
to
walk
round
one
or
two
groups
they
had
also
to
walk
round
norbert
flitcroft
which
was
very
like
walking
round
a
group
he
was
one
of
the
few
he
was
waddling
home
alone
who
did
not
identify
miss
tabor
and
her
effect
upon
him
was
extraordinary
his
mouth
opened
and
he
gazed
stodgily
his
widening
eyes
like
coming
out
of
a
fog
he
did
not
recognize
her
escort
did
not
see
him
at
all
until
they
had
passed
after
which
flitcroft
experienced
a
few
moments
of
trance
came
out
of
it
stricken
through
and
through
felt
nervously
of
his
tie
resolutely
fell
in
behind
the
heeling
mongrel
and
followed
at
a
distance
of
some
forty
paces
determined
to
learn
what
household
this
heavenly
visitor
honored
and
thrilling
with
the
intention
to
please
that
same
household
with
his
own
presence
as
soon
and
as
often
as
possible
ariel
flushed
a
little
when
she
perceived
the
extent
of
their
conspicuousness
but
it
was
not
the
blush
that
joe
remembered
had
reddened
the
tanned
skin
of
old
for
her
brownness
had
gone
long
ago
though
it
had
not
left
her
merely
pink
and
white
this
was
a
delicate
rosiness
rising
from
her
cheeks
to
her
temples
as
the
earliest
dawn
rises
if
there
had
been
many
words
left
in
joe
he
would
have
called
it
a
divine
blush
it
fascinated
him
and
if
anything
could
have
deepened
the
glamour
about
her
it
would
have
been
this
blush
he
did
not
understand
it
but
when
he
saw
it
he
stumbled
those
who
gaped
and
stared
were
for
him
only
blurs
in
the
background
truly
he
saw
men
as
trees
walking
and
when
it
became
necessary
to
step
out
to
the
curb
in
passing
some
clump
of
people
it
was
to
him
as
if
ariel
and
he
enchantedly
alone
were
working
their
way
through
underbrush
in
the
woods
he
kept
trying
to
realize
that
this
lady
of
wonder
was
ariel
tabor
but
he
could
not
he
could
not
connect
the
shabby
ariel
whom
he
had
treated
as
one
boy
treats
another
with
this
young
woman
of
the
world
he
had
always
been
embarrassed
himself
and
ashamed
of
her
when
anything
she
did
made
him
remember
that
after
all
she
was
a
girl
as
on
the
day
he
ran
away
when
she
kissed
a
lock
of
his
hair
escaping
from
the
bandage
with
that
recollection
even
his
ears
grew
red
it
did
not
seem
probable
that
it
would
ever
happen
again
the
next
instant
he
heard
himself
calling
her
miss
tabor
at
this
she
seemed
amused
you
ought
to
have
called
me
that
years
ago
she
said
for
all
you
knew
me
i
did
know
her
you
i
mean
he
answered
i
used
to
know
nearly
everything
you
were
going
to
say
before
you
said
it
it
seems
strange
now
yes
she
interrupted
it
does
seem
strange
now
somehow
he
went
on
i
doubt
if
now
i
know
somehow
she
echoed
with
fine
gravity
i
doubt
it
too
although
he
had
so
dim
a
perception
of
the
staring
and
whispering
which
greeted
and
followed
them
ariel
of
course
was
thoroughly
aware
of
it
though
the
only
sign
she
gave
was
the
slight
blush
which
very
soon
disappeared
that
people
turned
to
look
at
her
may
have
been
not
altogether
a
novelty
a
girl
who
had
learned
to
appear
unconscious
of
the
continental
stare
the
following
gaze
of
the
boulevards
the
frank
glasses
of
the
costanza
in
rome
was
not
ill
equipped
to
face
main
street
canaan
even
as
it
was
under
the
sycamores
before
they
started
they
had
not
talked
a
great
deal
there
had
been
long
silences
almost
all
her
questions
concerning
the
period
of
his
runaway
absence
she
appeared
to
know
and
to
understand
everything
which
had
happened
since
his
return
to
the
town
he
had
not
in
his
turn
reached
the
point
where
he
would
begin
to
question
her
he
was
too
breathless
in
his
consciousness
of
the
marvellous
present
hour
she
had
told
him
of
the
death
of
roger
tabor
the
year
before
poor
man
she
said
gently
he
lived
to
see
the
other
fellows
did
it
at
last
and
everybody
liked
him
he
was
very
happy
over
there
after
a
little
while
she
had
said
that
it
was
growing
close
upon
she
must
be
going
back
then
then
he
replied
ruefully
why
i
afraid
you
do
understand
it
would
do
for
you
to
be
seen
with
me
perhaps
though
you
do
understand
was
that
why
you
asked
me
to
meet
you
out
here
beyond
the
bridge
in
answer
she
looked
at
him
full
and
straight
for
three
seconds
then
threw
back
her
head
and
closed
her
eyes
tight
with
laughter
without
a
word
she
took
the
parasol
from
him
opened
it
herself
placed
the
smooth
white
coral
handle
of
it
in
his
hand
and
lightly
took
his
arm
there
was
no
further
demur
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
he
did
not
know
where
she
was
going
he
did
not
ask
soon
after
norbert
turned
to
follow
them
they
came
to
the
shady
part
of
the
street
where
the
town
in
summer
was
like
a
grove
detachments
from
the
procession
had
already
here
and
there
turned
in
at
the
various
gates
nobody
however
appeared
to
have
gone
except
for
fans
armed
with
which
immediately
to
return
to
rockers
upon
the
shaded
verandas
as
miss
tabor
and
joe
went
by
the
stopped
the
fans
poised
motionless
and
perspiring
old
gentlemen
wiping
their
necks
paused
in
arrested
attitudes
once
ariel
smiled
politely
not
at
louden
and
inclined
her
head
twice
with
the
result
that
the
latter
after
thinking
for
a
time
of
how
gracefully
she
did
it
and
how
pretty
the
top
of
her
hat
was
became
gradually
conscious
of
a
meaning
in
her
action
that
she
had
bowed
to
some
one
across
the
street
he
lifted
his
hat
about
four
minutes
late
and
discovered
mamie
pike
and
eugene
upon
the
opposite
pavement
walking
home
from
church
together
joe
changed
color
there
just
over
the
way
was
she
who
had
been
in
his
first
youth
the
fairy
child
the
little
princess
playing
in
the
palace
yard
and
always
afterward
his
lady
of
dreams
his
fair
unreachable
moon
and
joe
seeing
her
changed
color
that
was
all
he
had
passed
mamie
in
the
street
only
a
week
before
and
she
had
seemed
all
that
she
had
always
seemed
an
incomprehensible
and
subtle
change
had
befallen
her
a
change
so
mystifying
to
him
that
for
a
moment
he
almost
doubted
that
she
was
mamie
pike
it
came
to
him
with
a
shock
that
her
face
lacked
a
certain
vivacity
of
meaning
that
its
sweetness
was
perhaps
too
placid
that
there
would
have
been
a
deeper
goodness
in
it
had
there
been
any
hint
of
daring
astonishing
questions
assailed
him
startled
him
could
it
be
true
that
after
all
there
might
be
some
day
too
much
of
her
was
her
amber
hair
a
little
too
fluffy
was
something
the
matter
with
her
dress
everything
she
wore
had
always
seemed
so
beautiful
where
had
the
exquisiteness
of
it
gone
for
there
was
surely
no
exquisiteness
about
it
now
it
was
incredible
that
any
one
could
so
greatly
alter
in
the
few
days
elapsed
since
he
had
seen
her
strange
matters
mamie
had
never
looked
prettier
at
the
sound
of
ariel
voice
he
emerged
from
the
profundities
of
his
psychic
enigma
with
a
leap
she
is
lovelier
than
ever
is
she
yes
indeed
he
answered
blankly
would
you
still
risk
she
began
smiling
but
apparently
thinking
better
of
it
changed
her
question
what
is
the
name
of
your
dog
louden
you
have
told
me
oh
he
just
a
yellow
dog
he
evaded
unskilfully
young
man
she
said
sharply
well
he
admitted
reluctantly
i
call
him
speck
for
short
and
what
for
long
i
want
to
know
his
real
name
it
mighty
inappropriate
because
we
fond
of
each
other
said
joe
but
when
i
picked
him
up
he
was
so
yellow
and
so
thin
and
so
creeping
and
so
scared
that
i
christened
him
she
broke
into
light
laughter
stopped
short
in
the
midst
of
it
and
became
grave
ah
you
grown
bitter
she
said
gently
no
no
he
protested
i
told
you
i
liked
him
she
did
not
answer
they
were
now
opposite
the
pike
mansion
and
to
his
surprise
she
turned
indicating
the
way
by
a
touch
upon
his
sleeve
and
crossed
the
street
toward
the
gate
which
mamie
and
eugene
had
entered
mamie
after
exchanging
a
word
with
eugene
upon
the
steps
was
already
hurrying
into
the
house
ariel
paused
at
the
gate
as
if
waiting
for
joe
to
open
it
he
cocked
his
head
his
higher
eyebrow
rose
and
the
distorted
smile
appeared
i
do
believe
we
better
stop
here
he
said
the
last
time
i
tried
it
i
was
expunged
from
the
face
of
the
universe
do
you
know
she
cried
i
staying
here
judge
pike
has
charge
of
all
my
property
he
was
the
administrator
or
something
then
seeing
him
chopfallen
and
aghast
she
went
on
of
course
you
know
you
do
know
anything
about
me
you
have
even
asked
you
going
to
live
here
he
gasped
will
you
come
to
see
me
she
laughed
will
you
come
this
afternoon
he
grew
white
you
know
i
ca
he
said
you
came
here
once
you
risked
a
good
deal
then
just
to
see
mamie
dance
by
a
window
do
you
dare
a
little
for
an
old
friend
all
right
he
gulped
i
try
bantry
had
come
down
to
the
gate
and
was
holding
it
open
his
eyes
fixed
upon
ariel
within
them
a
rising
glow
an
impression
came
to
joe
afterward
that
his
had
looked
very
handsome
possibly
you
remember
me
miss
tabor
said
eugene
in
a
deep
and
impressive
voice
lifting
his
hat
we
were
neighbors
i
believe
in
the
old
days
she
gave
him
her
hand
in
a
fashion
somewhat
mannerly
favoring
him
with
a
bright
negligent
smile
oh
quite
she
answered
turning
again
to
joe
as
she
entered
the
gate
then
i
shall
expect
you
i
try
said
joe
i
try
he
stumbled
away
respectability
and
he
together
interfering
alarmingly
with
the
comfort
of
flitcroft
who
had
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
pavement
to
stare
glassily
at
ariel
eugene
accompanied
the
latter
into
the
house
and
joe
looking
back
understood
mamie
had
sent
his
to
bring
ariel
in
and
to
keep
him
from
following
this
afternoon
the
thought
took
away
his
breath
and
he
became
paler
the
pike
brougham
rolled
by
him
and
sam
warden
from
the
box
favored
his
old
friend
upon
the
pavement
with
a
liberal
display
of
the
whites
of
his
eyes
the
judge
evidently
had
been
detained
after
services
without
doubt
a
meeting
of
the
church
officials
pike
blinking
and
frightened
sat
at
her
husband
side
agreeing
feebly
with
the
which
rumbled
out
of
the
open
window
of
the
brougham
i
want
orthodox
preaching
in
my
church
and
by
god
madam
i
have
it
that
fellow
has
got
to
go
joe
took
off
his
hat
and
wiped
his
brow
xii
to
remain
on
the
field
of
battle
is
not
always
a
victory
mamie
waiting
just
inside
the
door
as
ariel
and
eugene
entered
gave
the
visitor
a
pale
greeting
and
a
moment
later
hearing
the
wheels
of
the
brougham
crunch
the
gravel
of
the
hurried
away
down
the
broad
hall
and
disappeared
ariel
dropped
her
parasol
upon
a
table
near
the
door
and
removing
her
gloves
drifted
into
a
room
at
the
left
where
a
grand
piano
found
shelter
beneath
crimson
plush
after
a
moment
of
contemplation
she
pushed
back
the
coverlet
and
seating
herself
upon
the
to
match
let
her
fingers
run
up
and
down
the
once
and
fall
listlessly
in
her
lap
as
she
gazed
with
deep
interest
at
three
colored
photographs
in
carved
gilt
frames
upon
the
wall
she
was
facing
judge
pike
mamie
and
pike
with
her
rubies
please
do
stop
playing
miss
tabor
said
a
voice
behind
her
she
had
not
observed
that
eugene
had
followed
her
into
the
room
very
well
if
you
like
she
answered
looking
up
to
smile
absently
at
him
and
she
began
to
play
a
rakish
little
air
which
composed
by
some
at
a
cafe
table
had
lately
skipped
out
of
the
moulin
rouge
to
disport
itself
over
paris
she
played
it
slowly
in
the
minor
with
elfish
pathos
while
he
leaned
upon
the
piano
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
fingers
which
bore
few
rings
none
he
observed
with
an
unreasonable
pleasure
upon
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
it
one
of
those
simpler
grieg
things
is
it
he
said
sighing
gently
i
care
for
grieg
would
you
mind
its
being
chaminade
she
returned
dropping
her
eyes
to
cloak
the
sin
ah
no
i
recognize
it
now
replied
eugene
he
appeals
to
me
even
more
than
grieg
at
this
she
glanced
quickly
up
at
him
but
more
quickly
down
again
and
hastened
the
time
emphatically
swinging
the
little
air
into
the
major
do
you
play
the
chorus
she
shook
her
head
vous
name
pas
wagner
inquired
eugene
leaning
toward
her
oh
yes
she
answered
bending
her
head
far
over
so
that
her
face
was
concealed
from
him
except
the
chin
which
he
saw
with
a
thrill
of
inexplicable
emotion
was
trembling
slightly
there
were
some
small
white
flowers
upon
her
hat
and
these
shook
too
she
stopped
playing
abruptly
rose
from
the
stool
and
crossed
the
room
to
a
large
mahogany
chair
upholstered
in
red
velvet
and
of
hybrid
construction
possessing
both
rockers
and
legs
she
had
moved
in
a
way
which
prevented
him
from
seeing
her
face
but
he
was
certain
of
her
agitation
and
strangely
glad
while
curious
tremulous
edged
with
prophecy
bubbled
to
the
surface
of
his
consciousness
when
she
turned
to
him
he
was
surprised
to
see
that
she
looked
astonishingly
happy
almost
as
if
she
had
been
struggling
with
joy
instead
of
pain
this
chair
she
said
sinking
into
it
makes
me
feel
at
home
naturally
he
could
not
understand
because
she
explained
i
once
thought
i
was
going
to
live
in
it
it
has
been
reupholstered
but
i
should
know
it
if
i
met
in
anywhere
in
the
world
how
very
odd
exclaimed
eugene
staring
i
settled
here
in
pioneer
days
she
went
on
tapping
the
arms
lightly
with
her
it
was
the
last
dance
i
went
to
in
canaan
i
fear
the
town
was
very
provincial
at
that
time
he
returned
having
completely
forgotten
the
occasion
she
mentioned
therefore
wishing
to
shift
the
subject
i
fear
you
may
still
find
it
so
there
is
not
much
here
that
one
is
in
sympathy
with
intellectually
few
people
really
of
the
world
few
people
i
suppose
you
mean
she
said
softly
with
a
look
that
went
deep
enough
into
his
eyes
few
people
who
really
understand
one
eugene
had
seated
himself
on
the
sill
of
an
open
window
close
by
there
has
been
he
answered
with
the
ghost
of
a
sigh
no
one
she
turned
her
head
slightly
away
from
him
apparently
occupied
with
a
loose
thread
in
her
sleeve
there
were
no
loose
threads
it
was
an
old
habit
of
hers
which
she
retained
i
suppose
she
murmured
in
a
voice
as
low
as
his
had
been
that
a
man
of
your
sort
might
find
canaan
rather
lonely
and
sad
it
has
been
whereupon
she
made
him
a
laughing
little
bow
you
are
sure
you
complain
of
canaan
yes
he
exclaimed
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
live
here
i
think
i
do
i
lived
here
seventeen
years
oh
yes
he
began
to
object
as
a
child
but
have
you
any
recollection
she
interrupted
of
the
day
before
your
brother
ran
away
of
coming
home
for
vacation
i
think
it
was
your
first
year
in
college
and
intervening
between
your
brother
and
me
in
a
for
a
moment
he
was
genuinely
perplexed
then
his
face
cleared
certainly
he
said
i
found
him
bullying
you
and
gave
him
a
good
punishing
for
it
is
that
all
you
remember
yes
he
replied
honestly
was
that
all
quite
she
smiled
her
eyes
half
closed
except
that
i
went
home
immediately
afterward
naturally
said
eugene
my
was
very
much
chevalier
sans
peur
et
sans
reproche
ah
i
should
like
to
polish
up
my
french
a
little
would
you
mind
my
asking
you
to
read
a
bit
with
me
some
little
thing
of
daudet
if
you
care
for
him
in
the
original
an
hour
now
and
then
perhaps
mamie
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
eugene
rose
swiftly
i
have
been
trying
to
persuade
miss
tabor
he
explained
with
something
too
much
of
laughter
to
play
again
you
heard
that
little
thing
of
chaminade
mamie
did
not
appear
to
hear
him
she
entered
breathlessly
and
there
was
no
color
in
her
cheeks
ariel
she
exclaimed
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
a
oh
my
dear
ariel
said
with
a
gesture
of
deprecation
no
miss
pike
went
on
all
in
one
breath
but
i
afraid
you
will
think
it
because
papa
knows
and
he
wants
to
see
you
what
is
it
that
he
knows
that
you
were
walking
with
joseph
louden
this
was
as
if
she
had
said
that
you
poisoned
your
mother
i
did
tell
him
but
when
we
saw
you
with
him
i
was
troubled
and
asked
eugene
what
i
better
do
because
eugene
always
knows
what
is
best
expression
despite
this
tribute
was
not
happy
and
he
advised
me
to
tell
mamma
about
it
and
leave
it
in
her
hands
but
she
always
tells
papa
everything
certainly
that
is
understood
said
ariel
slowly
turning
to
smile
at
eugene
and
she
told
him
this
right
away
mamie
finished
why
should
she
if
it
is
of
the
slightest
interest
to
him
the
daughter
of
the
house
exhibited
signs
of
consternation
he
wants
to
see
you
she
repeated
falteringly
he
in
the
library
having
thus
discharged
her
errand
she
hastened
to
the
which
had
been
left
open
and
out
to
the
steps
evidently
with
the
intention
of
removing
herself
as
soon
and
as
far
as
possible
from
the
vicinity
of
the
library
eugene
visibly
perturbed
followed
her
to
the
doorway
of
the
room
and
paused
do
you
know
the
way
he
inquired
with
a
note
of
solemnity
where
ariel
had
not
risen
to
the
library
of
course
she
said
beaming
upon
him
i
was
about
to
ask
you
if
you
would
speak
to
the
judge
for
me
this
is
such
a
comfortable
old
friend
this
chair
speak
to
him
for
you
repeated
the
eugene
she
nodded
cheerfully
if
i
may
trouble
you
tell
him
certainly
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
him
he
threw
a
piteous
glance
after
mamie
who
was
now
as
he
saw
through
the
open
door
out
upon
the
lawn
and
beyond
easy
hailing
distance
when
he
turned
again
to
look
at
ariel
he
discovered
that
she
had
shifted
the
position
of
her
chair
slightly
and
was
gazing
out
of
the
window
with
every
appearance
of
cheerful
meditation
she
assumed
so
unmistakably
that
he
had
of
course
gone
on
her
mission
that
dismayed
and
his
soul
quaking
he
could
find
neither
an
alternative
nor
words
to
explain
to
this
dazzling
lady
that
not
he
nor
any
other
could
bear
such
a
message
to
martin
pike
eugene
went
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
and
he
wished
with
every
step
that
the
distance
to
the
portals
of
the
library
might
have
been
greater
in
whatever
guise
he
delivered
the
summons
it
was
perfectly
efficacious
a
door
slammed
a
heavy
and
rapid
tread
was
heard
in
the
hall
and
ariel
without
otherwise
moving
turned
her
head
and
offered
a
brilliant
smile
of
greeting
it
was
good
of
you
she
said
as
the
doorway
filled
with
red
imperial
wrath
to
wish
to
have
a
little
chat
with
me
i
anxious
of
course
to
go
over
my
affairs
with
you
and
last
night
after
my
journey
i
was
too
tired
but
now
we
might
begin
not
in
detail
of
course
just
yet
that
will
do
for
later
when
i
learned
more
about
business
the
great
one
had
stopped
on
the
threshold
madam
he
began
coldly
when
i
say
my
library
i
mean
my
oh
yes
she
interrupted
with
amiable
weariness
i
know
you
mean
you
keep
all
the
papers
and
books
of
the
estate
in
there
but
i
think
we
better
put
them
off
for
a
few
days
i
not
talking
about
the
estate
he
exclaimed
what
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about
is
being
seen
with
joseph
louden
yes
she
nodded
brightly
that
along
the
line
we
must
take
up
first
yes
it
is
he
hurled
his
at
her
you
knew
everything
about
him
and
his
standing
in
this
community
i
know
you
did
because
pike
told
me
you
asked
all
about
him
from
mamie
after
you
came
last
night
and
see
here
do
you
oh
but
i
knew
before
that
she
laughed
i
had
a
correspondent
in
canaan
one
who
has
always
taken
a
great
interest
in
louden
i
asked
miss
pike
only
to
get
her
own
point
of
view
i
want
to
tell
you
madam
he
shouted
coming
toward
her
that
no
member
of
my
household
that
another
point
we
must
take
up
i
glad
you
remind
me
of
it
she
said
thoughtfully
yet
with
so
magically
compelling
an
intonation
that
he
stopped
his
shouting
in
the
middle
of
a
word
stopped
with
an
apoplectic
splutter
we
must
arrange
to
put
the
old
house
in
order
at
once
we
arrange
nothing
of
the
sort
he
responded
after
a
moment
of
angry
silence
you
going
to
stay
right
here
ah
i
know
your
hospitality
she
bowed
graciously
but
of
course
i
must
not
tax
it
too
far
and
about
louden
as
i
said
i
want
to
speak
to
you
about
him
yes
he
intervened
harshly
so
do
i
and
i
going
to
do
it
quick
you
find
again
she
mysteriously
baffled
him
he
a
dear
old
friend
of
mine
you
know
and
i
have
made
up
my
mind
that
we
both
need
his
help
you
and
i
what
yes
she
continued
calmly
in
a
business
way
i
mean
i
know
you
have
great
interests
in
a
hundred
directions
all
more
important
than
mine
it
is
fair
that
you
should
bear
the
whole
burden
of
my
affairs
and
i
think
it
will
be
best
to
retain
louden
as
my
man
of
business
he
could
take
all
the
cares
of
the
estate
off
your
shoulders
martin
pike
spoke
no
word
but
he
looked
at
her
strangely
and
she
watched
him
with
sudden
keenness
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
her
gaze
alert
but
quiet
fixed
on
the
dilating
pupils
of
his
eyes
he
seemed
to
become
dizzy
and
the
choleric
scarlet
which
had
overspread
his
broad
face
and
big
neck
faded
splotchily
still
keeping
her
eyes
upon
him
she
went
on
i
have
asked
him
yet
and
so
i
do
know
whether
or
not
he
consent
but
i
think
it
possible
that
he
may
come
to
see
me
this
afternoon
and
if
he
does
we
can
propose
it
to
him
together
and
go
over
things
a
little
judge
pike
recovered
his
voice
he
get
a
warm
welcome
he
promised
huskily
if
he
sets
foot
on
my
premises
you
mean
you
prefer
i
should
receive
him
here
she
nodded
pleasantly
then
certainly
i
shall
not
such
things
are
much
better
for
offices
you
are
quite
right
you
not
see
him
at
all
ah
judge
pike
she
lifted
her
hand
with
gentle
deprecation
you
understand
that
we
ca
quite
arrange
that
you
see
louden
is
even
an
older
friend
of
mine
than
you
are
and
so
i
must
trust
his
advice
about
such
things
more
than
yours
of
course
if
he
too
should
think
it
better
for
me
not
to
see
him
the
judge
advanced
toward
her
i
tired
of
this
he
began
in
a
loud
voice
i
she
moved
as
if
to
rise
but
he
had
come
very
close
leaning
above
her
one
arm
and
at
the
end
of
it
a
heavy
forefinger
which
he
was
shaking
at
her
so
that
it
was
difficult
to
get
out
of
her
chair
without
pushing
him
away
a
feat
apparently
impossible
ariel
tabor
in
rising
placed
her
hand
upon
his
arm
quite
as
if
he
had
offered
it
to
assist
her
he
fell
back
a
step
in
complete
astonishment
she
rose
quickly
and
released
his
arm
thank
you
she
said
beamingly
it
quite
all
my
fault
that
tired
i
been
thoughtless
to
keep
you
so
long
and
you
have
been
standing
too
she
swept
lightly
and
quickly
to
the
door
where
she
paused
gathering
her
skirts
i
shall
not
detain
you
another
instant
and
if
louden
comes
this
afternoon
i
remember
i
not
let
him
come
in
of
course
it
will
be
perhaps
pleasanter
to
talk
over
my
proposition
as
we
walk
there
was
a
very
faint
spicy
odor
like
wild
roses
and
cinnamon
left
in
the
room
where
martin
pike
stood
alone
staring
whitely
at
the
open
doorway
xiii
the
watcher
and
the
warden
there
was
a
custom
of
canaan
and
seldom
honored
in
the
breach
which
put
ariel
that
afternoon
in
easy
possession
of
a
coign
of
vantage
commanding
the
front
gate
the
heavy
sunday
dinner
was
finished
in
silence
on
the
part
of
judge
pike
deafening
about
three
and
soon
after
mamie
tossed
a
number
of
cushions
out
upon
the
stoop
between
the
dogs
sam
warden
having
previously
covered
the
steps
with
a
rug
and
placed
several
garden
chairs
near
by
on
the
grass
these
simple
preparations
concluded
eugene
sprawled
comfortably
upon
the
rug
and
mamie
seated
herself
near
him
while
ariel
wandered
with
apparent
aimlessness
about
the
lawn
followed
by
the
gaze
of
bantry
until
miss
pike
begged
her
a
little
petulantly
to
join
them
she
came
looking
about
her
dreamily
and
touching
to
her
lips
now
and
then
with
an
absent
air
a
clover
blossom
she
had
found
in
the
longer
grass
against
the
fence
she
stopped
to
pat
the
neck
of
one
of
the
deer
and
with
grave
eyes
proffered
the
first
for
inspection
then
as
food
there
were
those
in
the
world
who
seeing
her
might
have
wondered
that
the
deer
did
not
play
galatea
and
come
to
life
no
she
said
aloud
to
the
steadfast
head
you
wo
what
a
mistake
to
be
made
of
she
smiled
and
nodded
to
a
clump
of
near
a
and
to
nothing
else
so
far
as
eugene
and
mamie
could
see
then
walked
thoughtfully
to
the
steps
who
in
the
world
were
you
speaking
to
asked
mamie
curiously
that
deer
but
you
bowed
to
some
one
oh
that
ariel
lifted
her
eyebrows
that
was
your
father
you
see
him
no
i
believe
you
ca
from
here
after
all
said
ariel
slowly
he
is
sitting
upon
a
rustic
bench
between
the
bushes
and
the
quite
near
the
gate
no
you
could
see
him
from
here
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
the
deer
at
least
and
even
then
you
might
not
notice
him
unless
you
looked
for
him
he
has
a
book
a
bible
i
think
but
i
do
think
he
is
reading
he
usually
takes
a
nap
on
sunday
afternoons
said
mamie
i
do
think
he
will
ariel
looked
at
eugene
who
avoided
her
clear
gaze
he
has
the
air
of
having
settled
himself
to
stay
for
a
long
time
perhaps
until
evening
she
had
put
on
her
hat
after
dinner
and
mamie
now
inquired
if
she
would
not
prefer
to
remove
it
offering
to
carry
it
for
her
to
ariel
room
to
insure
its
safety
you
look
so
sort
of
temporary
wearing
it
she
urged
as
if
you
were
only
here
for
a
little
while
it
the
loveliest
hat
i
ever
saw
and
so
fragile
too
but
i
take
care
ariel
laughed
leaned
over
and
touched
the
other
hand
lightly
it
is
that
dear
what
is
it
then
mamie
beamed
out
into
a
joyful
smile
she
had
felt
sure
that
she
could
not
understand
ariel
was
indeed
afraid
of
her
and
she
found
herself
astonishingly
pleased
to
be
called
dear
and
delighted
with
the
little
familiarity
of
the
her
feeling
toward
the
visitor
who
was
so
her
father
had
announced
to
become
a
permanent
member
of
the
household
had
been
until
now
undefined
she
had
been
on
her
guard
watching
for
some
sign
of
conscious
superiority
in
this
lady
who
had
been
so
long
not
knowing
what
to
make
of
her
though
thrown
by
the
contents
of
her
trunks
into
a
wistfulness
which
would
have
had
something
of
rapture
in
it
had
she
been
sure
that
she
was
going
to
like
ariel
she
had
gone
to
the
latter
room
before
church
and
had
perceived
uneasily
that
it
had
become
even
by
the
process
of
unpacking
the
prettiest
room
she
had
ever
seen
mrs
warden
wife
of
sam
and
handmaiden
of
the
mansion
was
assisting
alternately
faint
and
vociferous
with
marvelling
mamie
feared
that
ariel
might
be
a
little
overpowering
with
the
word
dear
that
is
of
course
with
the
way
it
was
spoken
and
with
the
touch
upon
the
hand
it
was
all
suddenly
settled
she
would
not
understand
ariel
always
that
was
clear
but
they
would
like
each
other
i
am
wearing
my
hat
answered
ariel
because
at
any
moment
i
may
decide
to
go
for
a
long
walk
oh
i
hope
not
said
mamie
there
are
sure
to
be
people
a
few
still
come
even
though
i
an
engaged
girl
i
expect
that
just
to
console
me
though
she
added
smiling
over
this
worn
quip
of
the
betrothed
and
shaking
her
head
at
eugene
who
grew
red
and
coughed
there
be
plenty
but
they
wo
be
here
to
see
me
you
ariel
and
they
be
terribly
disappointed
if
you
were
here
i
should
wonder
if
the
whole
town
came
it
curious
enough
about
you
canaan
at
least
that
part
of
it
which
mamie
meant
when
she
said
the
whole
town
already
offered
testimony
to
her
truthfulness
two
gentlemen
aged
nine
and
eleven
and
clad
in
white
sailor
suits
were
at
that
moment
grooving
their
cheeks
between
the
round
pickets
of
the
gate
they
had
come
from
the
house
across
the
street
evidently
stimulated
by
the
conversation
at
their
own
recent
they
wore
a
few
deposits
such
as
are
left
by
and
the
motive
of
their
conduct
became
obvious
when
upon
being
joined
by
a
person
from
next
door
a
starched
and
frilled
person
of
the
opposite
sex
but
sympathetic
age
one
of
them
waggled
a
forefinger
through
the
gate
at
ariel
and
a
voice
was
heard
in
explanation
that
her
there
was
a
rustle
in
the
near
the
the
three
small
heads
turned
simultaneously
in
that
direction
something
terrific
was
evidently
seen
and
with
a
horrified
oooh
the
trio
skedaddled
headlong
they
were
but
the
gay
vanguard
of
the
life
which
the
street
quite
dead
through
the
sunday
presently
took
on
young
couples
with
their
progeny
began
to
appear
returning
from
the
weekly
reunion
sunday
dinner
with
relatives
young
people
meditative
until
they
reached
the
pike
mansion
the
wives
fanning
themselves
or
shooing
the
ahead
of
them
while
the
husbands
wearing
long
coats
satin
ties
and
showing
dust
upon
their
blazing
shoes
invariably
pushed
the
perambulators
most
of
these
exchanged
greetings
with
mamie
and
eugene
and
all
of
them
looked
hard
at
ariel
as
long
as
it
was
possible
and
now
the
young
men
of
the
town
laboriously
arranged
as
to
apparel
began
to
appear
on
the
street
in
small
squads
making
their
sunday
rounds
the
youngest
working
in
phalanxes
of
threes
and
fours
those
somewhat
older
inclining
to
move
in
pairs
the
eldest
such
as
were
now
beginning
to
be
considered
beaux
or
by
the
extremely
youthful
old
bachelors
evidently
considered
it
advantageous
to
travel
alone
of
all
these
there
were
few
who
did
not
before
evening
fell
turn
in
at
the
gate
of
the
pike
mansion
consciously
shyly
or
confidently
according
to
the
condition
of
their
souls
they
made
their
way
between
the
deer
to
be
presented
to
the
visitor
ariel
sat
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
looking
amiably
over
their
heads
talked
with
such
as
could
get
near
her
there
were
many
who
could
not
and
mamie
occupying
the
bench
below
was
surrounded
by
the
overflow
the
difficulty
of
reaching
and
maintaining
a
position
near
miss
tabor
was
increased
by
the
attitude
and
behavior
of
flitcroft
who
that
day
cooled
the
feeling
of
friendship
which
several
of
his
had
hitherto
entertained
for
him
he
had
been
the
first
to
arrive
coming
alone
though
that
was
not
his
custom
and
he
established
himself
at
ariel
right
upon
the
step
just
below
her
so
disposing
the
great
body
and
the
ponderous
arms
and
legs
the
gods
had
given
him
that
no
one
could
mount
above
him
to
sit
beside
her
or
approach
her
from
that
direction
within
conversational
distance
once
established
he
was
not
to
be
dislodged
and
the
only
satisfaction
for
those
in
this
manner
debarred
from
the
society
of
the
beautiful
stranger
was
obtained
when
they
were
presented
to
her
and
when
they
took
their
departure
on
these
occasions
it
was
necessary
by
custom
for
them
to
shake
her
hand
a
ceremony
they
accomplished
by
leaning
across
flitcroft
which
was
a
long
way
to
lean
and
the
fat
back
and
shoulders
were
sore
that
night
because
of
what
had
been
surreptitiously
done
to
them
by
revengeful
elbows
and
knees
norbert
not
ordinarily
talkative
had
nothing
to
say
he
seemed
to
find
sufficient
occupation
in
keeping
the
place
he
had
gained
and
from
this
close
vantage
he
fastened
his
small
eyes
immovably
upon
profile
eugene
also
apparently
determined
not
to
move
sat
throughout
the
afternoon
at
her
left
but
as
he
was
thin
others
who
came
and
went
were
able
to
approach
upon
that
side
and
hold
speech
with
her
she
was
a
stranger
to
these
young
people
most
of
whom
had
grown
up
together
in
a
nickname
intimacy
few
of
them
had
more
than
a
very
imperfect
recollection
of
her
as
she
was
before
roger
tabor
and
she
had
departed
out
of
canaan
she
had
lived
her
girlhood
only
upon
their
borderland
with
no
intimates
save
her
grandfather
and
joe
and
she
returned
to
her
native
town
a
revelation
and
a
dream
as
young
bradbury
told
his
incredulous
grandmother
that
night
the
conversation
of
the
gallants
consisted
for
the
greater
part
of
witticisms
at
one
another
expense
which
though
evoked
for
benefit
all
eyes
furtively
reverting
to
her
as
each
shaft
was
loosed
she
found
more
or
less
enigmatical
the
young
men
however
laughed
at
each
other
loudly
and
seemed
content
if
now
and
then
she
smiled
you
must
be
frightfully
ennuied
with
all
this
eugene
said
to
her
you
see
how
provincial
we
still
are
she
did
not
answer
she
had
not
heard
him
the
shadows
were
stretching
themselves
over
the
grass
long
and
attenuated
the
sunlight
upon
the
trees
and
houses
was
like
a
thin
rosy
pigment
black
birds
were
calling
each
other
home
to
beech
and
elm
and
ariel
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
western
distance
of
the
street
where
was
beginning
to
quiver
in
the
air
she
did
not
hear
eugene
but
she
started
a
moment
later
when
the
name
joe
louden
was
pronounced
by
a
young
man
the
poetic
bradbury
on
the
step
below
eugene
some
one
immediately
said
but
she
leaned
over
and
addressed
bradbury
who
shut
out
not
only
from
the
group
about
her
but
from
the
other
centring
upon
miss
pike
as
well
was
holding
a
private
conversation
with
a
friend
in
like
misfortune
what
were
you
saying
of
mr
louden
she
asked
smiling
down
upon
the
young
man
it
was
this
smile
which
inspired
his
description
of
her
as
a
revelation
and
a
dream
oh
nothing
particular
was
his
embarrassed
reply
i
only
mentioned
i
heard
there
was
some
talk
among
the
he
paused
awkwardly
remembering
that
ariel
had
walked
with
joseph
louden
in
the
face
of
canaan
that
very
day
that
is
i
mean
to
say
there
some
talk
of
his
running
for
mayor
what
there
was
a
general
exclamation
followed
by
an
uncomfortable
moment
or
two
of
silence
no
one
present
was
unaware
of
that
noon
walk
though
there
was
prevalent
a
pleasing
notion
that
it
would
not
happen
again
founded
on
the
idea
that
ariel
having
only
arrived
the
previous
evening
had
probably
met
joe
on
the
street
by
accident
and
remembering
him
as
a
playmate
of
her
childhood
and
uninformed
as
to
his
reputation
had
naturally
enough
permitted
him
to
walk
home
with
her
flitcroft
broke
the
silence
rushing
into
words
with
a
derisive
laugh
yes
he
of
for
mayor
by
the
saloon
people
and
the
niggers
i
expect
the
beaver
beach
crowd
would
be
for
him
and
if
tramps
could
vote
he
might
what
is
beaver
beach
asked
ariel
not
turning
what
is
beaver
beach
he
repeated
and
cast
his
eyes
to
the
sky
shaking
his
head
awesomely
it
a
place
he
said
with
abysmal
solemnity
a
place
i
should
have
mentioned
in
your
presence
miss
tabor
what
has
it
to
do
with
mr
louden
the
predestined
norbert
conceived
the
present
to
be
a
opportunity
to
enlighten
her
concerning
joe
character
since
the
pikes
appeared
to
have
been
derelict
in
the
performance
of
this
kindness
he
goes
there
he
proceeded
heavily
he
lived
there
for
a
while
when
he
first
came
back
from
running
away
and
he
a
friend
of
mike
sheehan
that
runs
it
he
a
friend
of
all
the
that
hang
around
there
how
do
you
know
he
goes
there
why
it
was
in
the
paper
the
day
after
he
came
back
he
appealed
for
corroboration
was
it
eugene
no
no
she
persisted
newspapers
are
sometimes
mistaken
they
laughing
a
little
she
swept
across
the
bulbous
face
beside
her
a
swift
regard
that
was
like
a
how
do
you
know
flitcroft
she
went
on
very
rapidly
raising
her
voice
how
do
you
know
that
louden
is
familiar
with
this
place
the
newspapers
may
have
been
falsely
informed
you
must
admit
that
then
how
do
you
know
have
you
ever
met
any
one
who
has
seen
him
there
i
seen
him
there
myself
the
words
skipped
out
of
norbert
mouth
like
so
many
little
devils
the
instant
he
opened
it
she
had
spoken
so
quickly
and
with
such
vehemence
looking
him
full
in
the
eye
that
he
had
forgotten
everything
in
the
world
except
making
the
point
to
which
her
insistence
had
led
him
mamie
looked
horrified
there
was
a
sound
of
smothered
laughter
and
norbert
overwhelmed
by
the
treachery
of
his
own
mouth
sat
gasping
it
ca
be
such
a
terrific
place
then
after
all
said
ariel
gently
and
turning
to
eugene
have
you
ever
been
there
mr
bantry
she
asked
he
changed
color
but
answered
with
enough
glibness
no
several
of
the
young
men
rose
the
wretched
flitcroft
however
evading
mamie
eye
in
which
there
was
a
distinct
hint
sat
where
he
was
until
all
of
them
except
eugene
had
taken
a
reluctant
departure
one
group
after
another
leaving
in
the
order
of
their
arrival
the
rosy
pigment
which
had
colored
the
trees
faded
the
of
the
western
distance
danced
itself
pale
and
departed
dusk
stalked
into
the
town
from
the
east
and
still
the
watcher
upon
the
steps
and
the
warden
of
the
gate
he
of
the
and
the
bible
held
their
places
and
waited
waited
alas
in
vain
ah
joe
is
this
the
mettle
of
your
daring
did
you
not
say
you
would
try
was
your
courage
so
frail
a
vessel
that
it
could
not
carry
you
even
to
the
gate
yonder
surely
you
knew
that
if
you
had
striven
so
far
there
you
would
have
been
met
perhaps
you
foresaw
that
not
one
but
two
would
meet
you
at
the
gate
both
the
warden
and
the
watcher
what
of
that
what
of
that
o
faint
heart
what
was
there
to
fear
listen
the
gate
clicks
ah
have
you
come
at
last
ariel
started
to
her
feet
but
the
bent
figure
coming
up
the
walk
in
the
darkness
was
that
of
eskew
arp
he
bowed
gloomily
to
mamie
and
in
response
to
her
inquiry
if
he
wished
to
see
her
father
answered
no
he
had
come
to
talk
with
the
granddaughter
of
his
old
friend
roger
tabor
mr
arp
called
ariel
i
am
so
very
glad
she
ran
down
to
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
we
sit
here
on
the
bench
we
mamie
had
risen
and
skirting
norbert
frostily
touched
eugene
upon
the
shoulder
as
she
went
up
the
steps
he
understood
that
he
was
to
follow
her
and
after
a
deep
look
at
the
bench
where
ariel
had
seated
herself
beside
arp
he
obeyed
norbert
was
left
a
lonely
ruin
between
the
cold
twin
dogs
he
had
wrought
desolation
this
afternoon
and
that
sweet
verdure
his
good
name
so
long
in
the
planting
so
carefully
tended
was
now
a
dreary
waste
yet
he
contemplated
this
not
so
much
as
his
present
aspect
of
splendid
isolation
frozen
by
the
daughter
of
the
house
forgotten
by
the
visitor
whose
conversation
with
arp
was
carried
on
in
tones
so
low
that
he
could
not
understand
it
the
fat
one
though
loath
to
take
himself
away
began
to
comprehend
that
his
hour
had
struck
he
rose
descended
the
steps
to
the
bench
and
seated
himself
unexpectedly
upon
the
cement
walk
at
ariel
feet
leg
gone
to
sleep
he
explained
in
response
to
her
startled
exclamation
but
like
a
great
soul
ignoring
the
accident
of
his
position
as
well
as
the
presence
of
arp
he
immediately
proceeded
will
you
go
riding
with
me
afternoon
are
you
very
mr
flitcroft
she
asked
with
an
odd
intonation
i
imposed
on
often
enough
he
replied
rubbing
his
leg
by
people
who
think
i
am
why
it
is
only
that
your
sitting
so
abruptly
upon
the
ground
reminded
me
of
something
that
happened
long
ago
before
i
left
canaan
the
last
time
i
met
you
i
do
think
i
knew
you
before
you
went
away
you
have
said
if
you
go
riding
with
me
please
get
up
interrupted
arp
acidly
somebody
fall
over
you
if
you
stay
there
such
a
catastrophe
in
truth
loomed
imminent
judge
pike
was
rapidly
approaching
on
his
way
to
the
house
bible
in
hand
far
better
in
hand
than
was
his
temper
for
it
is
an
enraging
thing
to
wait
five
hours
in
ambush
for
a
man
who
does
not
come
in
the
darkness
a
desecration
occurred
and
norbert
perfected
to
the
last
detail
whatever
had
been
left
incomplete
of
his
own
destruction
he
began
lumberingly
to
rise
talking
at
the
same
time
urging
upon
ariel
the
charms
of
the
roadside
wild
flowers
were
in
blossom
he
said
recounting
the
benefits
she
might
derive
through
acceptance
of
his
invitation
and
having
thus
busily
risen
to
his
knees
became
aware
that
some
one
was
passing
near
him
this
some
one
flitcroft
absorbed
in
artful
persuasions
may
have
been
betrayed
by
the
darkness
to
mistake
for
eugene
reaching
out
for
assistance
he
mechanically
seized
upon
the
skirts
of
a
coat
which
he
put
to
the
uses
of
a
rope
coming
up
with
such
noble
weight
and
energy
that
he
brought
himself
to
his
feet
and
the
owner
of
the
coat
to
the
ground
simultaneously
the
latter
hideously
astonished
went
down
with
an
objurgation
so
outrageous
in
venom
that
arp
jumped
with
the
shock
judge
pike
got
to
his
feet
quickly
but
not
so
quickly
as
the
piteous
flitcroft
betook
himself
into
the
deep
shadows
of
the
street
only
a
word
hoarse
and
was
left
quivering
on
the
night
breeze
by
this
accursed
whom
the
gods
intent
upon
his
ruin
had
early
in
the
day
at
his
first
sight
of
ariel
in
good
truth
made
mad
murder
can
i
help
you
brush
off
judge
asked
eskew
rising
painfully
either
martin
pike
was
beyond
words
or
the
courtesy
proposed
by
the
feeble
old
fellow
for
eskew
was
now
very
far
along
in
years
and
looked
his
age
emphasized
too
bitterly
the
indignity
which
had
been
put
upon
him
whatever
the
case
he
went
his
way
leaving
the
cynic
offer
unacknowledged
eskew
sank
back
upon
the
bench
with
the
little
rusty
sounds
suggestions
of
creaks
and
sighs
which
accompany
the
movement
of
antiques
i
always
thought
he
said
that
the
judge
had
spells
when
he
was
hard
of
hearing
oblongs
of
light
abruptly
dropped
from
the
windows
confronting
them
one
falling
across
the
bench
appropriately
touching
with
lemon
the
acrid
withered
face
and
trembling
hands
of
the
veteran
you
are
younger
than
you
were
nine
years
ago
arp
said
ariel
gayly
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
you
upon
the
street
and
i
thought
so
then
now
i
see
that
i
was
right
me
younger
he
groaned
no
i
mighty
near
through
with
this
fool
world
and
i
be
glad
of
it
if
i
did
expect
that
if
there
is
another
one
afterwards
it
would
be
jest
as
ornery
she
laughed
leaning
forward
resting
her
elbows
on
her
knee
and
her
chin
in
her
hand
so
that
the
shadow
of
her
hat
shielded
her
eyes
from
the
light
i
thought
you
looked
surprised
when
you
saw
me
to
day
i
reckon
i
did
he
exclaimed
who
would
of
been
why
why
he
repeated
confounded
by
her
simplicity
why
yes
she
laughed
that
what
i
anxious
to
know
was
the
whole
town
the
same
way
he
demanded
did
you
meet
anybody
that
did
look
surprised
but
why
should
they
good
lord
admighty
he
broke
out
ai
you
got
any
i
think
almost
all
i
have
are
still
in
the
customs
warehouse
then
use
mamie
pike
responded
the
old
man
the
town
never
dreamed
you
were
goin
to
turn
out
pretty
at
all
let
alone
the
way
you
turned
out
pretty
the
tocsin
had
a
good
deal
about
your
looks
and
so
forth
in
it
once
in
a
letter
from
paris
but
the
folks
that
remembered
you
kind
of
set
that
down
to
the
way
papers
talk
about
anybody
with
money
and
nobody
was
prepared
for
it
when
they
saw
you
you
do
need
to
drop
no
curtseys
to
me
he
set
his
mouth
grimly
in
response
to
the
bow
she
made
him
think
female
beauty
is
like
all
other
human
furbelows
and
as
holler
as
heaven
will
be
if
only
the
good
people
are
let
in
but
yet
i
did
stop
to
look
at
you
when
you
went
past
me
and
i
kept
on
lookin
long
as
you
were
in
sight
i
reckon
i
always
will
when
i
git
the
chance
too
only
shows
what
human
nature
is
but
that
was
all
that
folks
were
starin
at
it
was
your
walkin
with
joe
louden
that
really
finished
and
i
can
say
it
upset
me
more
than
anything
i
seen
for
a
good
many
years
upset
you
mr
arp
she
cried
i
do
quite
see
the
old
man
shook
his
head
deploringly
after
what
i
written
you
about
that
boy
ah
she
said
softly
touching
his
sleeve
with
her
fingers
i
have
thanked
you
for
that
you
need
he
returned
sharply
it
was
a
pleasure
do
you
remember
how
easy
and
quick
i
promised
you
i
remember
that
you
were
very
kind
kind
he
gave
forth
an
acid
and
chilling
laugh
it
was
about
two
months
after
louden
ran
away
and
before
you
and
roger
left
canaan
and
you
asked
me
to
promise
to
write
to
you
whenever
word
of
that
outcast
came
i
did
put
it
so
mr
arp
no
but
you
ought
of
you
asked
me
to
write
you
whatever
news
of
him
should
come
and
if
he
came
back
to
tell
you
how
and
when
and
all
about
it
and
i
did
it
and
kept
you
sharp
on
his
record
ever
since
he
landed
here
again
do
you
know
why
i
done
it
do
you
know
why
i
promised
so
quick
and
easy
i
would
do
it
out
of
the
kindness
of
your
heart
i
think
the
acid
laugh
was
repeated
no
ma
you
could
of
guessed
colder
i
promised
and
i
kept
my
promise
because
i
knew
there
would
never
be
anything
good
to
tell
and
there
never
was
nothing
at
all
she
insisted
gravely
never
i
leave
it
to
you
if
i
written
one
good
word
of
him
you
written
of
the
treatment
he
has
received
here
she
began
and
i
been
able
to
see
what
he
has
borne
and
bears
but
have
i
written
one
word
to
show
that
he
did
deserve
it
all
have
i
told
you
everything
of
his
associates
his
indeed
you
have
then
do
you
wonder
that
i
was
more
surprised
than
most
when
i
saw
you
walking
with
him
because
i
knew
you
did
it
in
cold
blood
and
knowledge
aforethought
other
folks
thought
it
was
because
you
been
here
long
enough
to
hear
his
reputation
but
i
knew
tell
me
she
said
if
you
were
disappointed
when
you
saw
me
with
him
yes
he
snapped
i
was
i
thought
so
i
saw
the
consternation
in
your
face
you
approved
did
you
i
do
know
what
you
talking
about
yes
you
do
i
know
it
bothers
you
to
have
me
read
you
between
the
lines
but
for
this
once
you
must
let
me
you
are
so
consistent
that
you
are
never
disappointed
when
things
turn
out
badly
or
people
are
wicked
or
foolish
are
you
no
certainly
not
i
expect
it
and
you
were
disappointed
in
me
therefore
it
must
be
that
i
was
doing
something
you
knew
was
right
and
good
you
see
she
leaned
a
little
closer
to
him
smiling
angelically
ah
arp
she
cried
i
know
your
secret
you
admire
me
he
rose
confused
and
incoherent
as
full
of
denial
as
a
detected
pickpocket
i
do
me
admire
what
it
an
ornery
world
he
protested
i
do
admire
any
human
that
ever
lived
yes
you
do
she
persisted
i
just
proved
it
but
that
is
the
least
of
your
secret
the
great
thing
is
this
you
admire
mr
louden
i
never
heard
such
nonsense
he
continued
to
protest
at
the
same
time
moving
down
the
walk
toward
the
gate
leaning
heavily
on
his
stick
nothin
of
the
kind
there
ai
any
logic
to
that
kind
of
an
argument
nor
no
reason
you
see
i
understand
you
she
called
after
him
i
sorry
you
go
away
in
the
bitterness
of
being
found
out
found
out
his
stick
ceased
for
a
moment
to
tap
the
cement
pooh
he
ejaculated
uneasily
there
was
a
pause
followed
by
a
malevolent
chuckle
at
any
rate
he
said
with
joy
in
the
afterthought
never
go
walkin
with
him
again
he
waited
for
the
answer
which
came
after
a
time
sadly
perhaps
you
are
right
perhaps
i
shall
not
ha
i
thought
so
mr
arp
she
turned
toward
the
lighted
house
through
the
windows
nearest
her
she
could
see
mamie
seated
in
the
familiar
chair
following
with
happy
and
tender
eyes
the
figure
of
eugene
who
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
room
the
town
was
deadly
quiet
ariel
could
hear
the
sound
of
footsteps
perhaps
a
block
away
she
went
to
the
gate
and
gazed
a
long
time
into
the
empty
street
watching
the
yellow
grains
of
light
sieved
through
the
maples
from
the
arc
lights
on
the
corner
moving
to
and
fro
in
the
deep
shadow
as
the
lamp
swung
slightly
in
the
night
air
somewhere
not
far
away
the
peace
was
broken
by
the
screams
of
a
parlor
organ
which
honked
and
wailed
in
pious
agonies
the
intention
was
hymnal
interminably
protracting
each
spasm
presently
a
voice
outdid
the
organ
a
voice
which
made
vivid
the
picture
of
the
woman
who
owned
it
and
the
ploughed
forehead
of
her
above
the
when
the
were
proudly
given
birth
rescue
the
perishing
was
the
startlingly
appropriate
selection
rendered
with
inconceivable
lingering
upon
each
syllable
the
at
unexpected
intervals
two
male
voices
evidently
belonging
to
men
who
had
contracted
the
habit
of
holding
tin
in
their
mouths
joined
the
lady
in
a
thorough
search
for
the
lost
chord
that
was
the
last
of
silence
in
canaan
for
an
hour
or
so
the
organ
was
merely
inaugural
across
the
street
a
piano
sounded
firm
emphatic
determined
vocal
competition
with
the
instrument
here
also
rock
of
ages
the
incentive
another
piano
presently
followed
suit
in
a
neighboring
house
precious
jewels
more
distant
a
second
organ
was
heard
other
pianos
other
organs
took
up
other
themes
and
as
a
wakeful
puppy
barking
will
go
over
a
village
at
night
stirring
first
the
nearer
dogs
to
give
voice
these
in
turn
stimulating
those
farther
away
to
join
one
passing
the
excitement
on
to
another
until
hounds
in
far
beyond
the
town
contribute
to
the
conversation
even
so
did
rescue
the
perishing
enliven
the
greater
part
of
canaan
it
was
this
that
made
ariel
realize
a
thing
of
which
hitherto
she
had
not
been
able
to
convince
herself
that
she
was
actually
once
more
in
the
town
where
she
had
spent
her
girlhood
now
grown
to
seem
the
girlhood
of
some
other
person
it
was
true
her
foot
was
on
her
native
heath
and
her
name
was
ariel
tabor
the
very
name
of
the
girl
who
had
shared
the
town
disapproval
with
joe
louden
rescue
the
perishing
brought
it
all
back
to
her
and
she
listened
to
these
sharply
familiar
rites
of
the
canaanite
sabbath
evening
with
a
shiver
of
pain
she
turned
from
the
gate
to
go
into
the
house
heard
eugene
voice
at
the
door
and
paused
he
was
saying
to
mamie
and
please
say
revoir
to
miss
tabor
for
me
he
added
peering
out
under
his
hand
i
do
know
where
she
can
have
gone
probably
she
came
in
and
went
to
her
room
said
mamie
do
forget
to
tell
her
revoir
i
wo
dear
she
lifted
her
face
and
he
kissed
her
perfunctorily
then
he
came
down
the
steps
and
went
slowly
toward
the
gate
looking
about
him
into
the
darkness
as
if
searching
for
something
but
ariel
had
fled
away
from
the
path
of
light
that
led
from
the
open
door
she
skimmed
noiselessly
across
the
lawn
and
paused
at
the
side
of
the
house
leaning
against
the
veranda
where
on
a
night
long
past
a
boy
had
hid
and
a
girl
had
wept
a
small
creaking
sound
fell
upon
her
ear
and
she
made
out
an
ungainly
figure
approaching
wheeling
something
of
curious
shape
is
that
you
sam
she
said
mr
warden
stopped
close
by
yes
he
replied
i
out

hose

he
stretched
an
arm
along
the
of
the
reel
relaxing
himself
apparently
for
conversation
done
change
miss

he
continued
with
the
directness
of

of

with

xiv
white

in
a
as
upon
a
world
canopied
with
storm
hung
with
mourning
purple
and
habited
in
black
did
flitcroft
turn
his
morning
face
at
eight
antemeridian
monday
as
he
hied
himself
to
his
daily
duty
at
the
washington
national
bank
yet
more
than
the
merely
funereal
gloomed
out
from
the
hillocky
area
of
his
countenance
was
there
not
a
glow
a
vesuvian
shimmer
beneath
the
murk
of
that
darkling
eye
was
here
one
think
you
to
turn
the
other
cheek
little
has
he
learned
of
norbert
flitcroft
who
conceives
that
this
fiery
spirit
was
easily
to
be
quenched
look
upon
the
jowl
of
him
and
let
him
who
dares
maintain
that
people
even
the
very
pikes
themselves
were
to
grind
beneath
their
brougham
wheels
a
prostrate
norbert
and
ride
on
scatheless
in
this
his
own
metaphor
is
nearly
touched
i
guess
not
they
do
run
over
me
martin
pike
better
look
out
how
he
tries
it
so
mother
nature
at
her
kindly
tasks
good
norbert
uses
for
her
unguent
our
own
perfect
inconsistency
and
often
when
we
are
stabbed
deep
in
the
breast
she
distracts
us
by
thin
scratches
in
other
parts
that
in
the
itch
of
these
we
may
forget
the
greater
hurt
till
it
be
healed
thus
the
remembrance
of
last
night
when
you
undisguisedly
ran
from
the
wrath
of
a
pike
with
a
pretty
girl
looking
on
to
say
nothing
of
the
acrid
arp
who
will
fling
the
legend
on
a
thousand
winds
might
well
agonize
you
now
as
in
less
hasty
moments
and
at
a
safe
distance
you
brood
upon
the
piteous
figure
you
cut
on
the
contrary
behold
you
see
no
blood
crimsoning
the
edges
of
the
horrid
gash
in
your
panoply
of
you
but
smart
and
scratch
the
scratches
forgetting
your
wound
in
the
hot
itch
for
vengeance
it
is
an
itch
which
will
last
for
in
such
matters
your
temper
shall
be
steadfast
and
let
the
great
goliath
in
the
mean
time
beware
of
you
you
ran
last
night
you
ran
of
course
you
ran
why
not
you
ran
to
fight
another
day
a
bank
clerk
sometimes
has
opportunities
the
stricken
fat
one
could
not
understand
how
it
came
about
that
he
had
blurted
out
the
damning
confession
that
he
had
visited
beaver
beach
when
he
tried
to
solve
the
puzzle
his
mind
refused
the
strain
became
foggy
and
the
terrors
of
his
position
acute
was
he
like
joe
louden
to
endure
the
ban
of
canaan
and
like
him
stand
excommunicate
beyond
the
pale
because
of
martin
pike
displeasure
for
norbert
saw
with
perfect
clearness
what
the
judge
had
done
for
joe
now
that
he
stood
in
danger
of
a
fate
identical
this
came
home
to
him
how
many
others
he
wondered
would
do
as
mamie
had
done
and
write
notes
such
as
he
had
received
by
the
hand
of
sam
warden
late
last
night
dear
sir
this
from
mamie
who
in
the
canaanitish
way
had
been
wont
to
address
him
as
norb
my
father
wishes
me
to
state
that
after
your
remark
yesterday
afternoon
on
the
steps
which
was
overheard
by
my
mother
who
happened
to
be
standing
in
the
hall
behind
you
and
your
behavior
to
himself
later
on
he
considers
it
impossible
to
allow
you
to
call
any
more
or
to
speak
to
any
member
of
his
household
yours
respectfully
mamie
pike
erasures
and
restorations
bore
witness
to
a
considerable
doubt
in
mamie
mind
concerning
yours
respectfully
but
she
had
finally
let
it
stand
evidently
convinced
that
the
plain
signature
without
preface
savored
of
an
intimacy
denied
by
the
context
sir
repeated
norbert
between
set
teeth
to
allow
you
to
call
any
more
these
and
other
terms
of
his
dismissal
recurred
to
him
during
the
morning
and
ever
and
anon
he
looked
up
from
his
desk
his
lips
moving
to
the
tune
of
those
horrid
phrases
and
stared
out
at
the
street
basilisk
glaring
this
with
no
christian
softness
in
it
not
even
when
it
fell
upon
his
own
grandfather
sitting
among
the
sages
within
easy
from
the
big
window
at
elbow
however
colonel
flitcroft
was
not
disturbed
by
the
gaze
of
his
descendant
being
in
fact
quite
unaware
of
it
the
aged
men
were
having
a
busy
morning
the
conclave
was
not
what
it
had
been
see
arp
and
all
his
works
there
had
come
as
the
years
went
by
a
few
recruits
but
faces
were
missing
the
two
tabors
had
gone
and
uncle
joe
davey
could
no
longer
lay
claim
to
the
patriarchship
he
had
laid
it
down
with
a
and
gone
his
way
eskew
himself
was
now
the
oldest
of
the
conscript
fathers
the
colonel
and
squire
buckalew
pressing
him
closely
with
peter
bradbury
no
great
time
behind
they
did
not
plant
their
feet
upon
the
brass
rail
inside
the
hotel
windows
but
courted
the
genial
weather
and
as
their
summer
custom
was
tilted
back
their
chairs
in
the
shade
of
the
western
wall
of
the
building
and
who
could
of
dreamed
bradbury
was
saying
with
a
of
expectancy
at
eskew
that
jonas
tabor
would
ever
turn
out
to
have
a
niece
like
that
arp
ceased
to
fan
himself
with
his
wide
straw
hat
and
said
grimly
i
do
see
as
jonas
has
out
not
in
particular
if
turned
at
all
lately
i
reckon
it
in
his
grave
and
i
bet
he
has
if
he
had
any
way
of
hearin
how
much
she
must
of
spent
for
clothes
i
believe
squire
buckalew
began
that
young
folks
memories
are
short
they
lucky
interjected
eskew
the
shorter
your
memory
the
less
meanness
you
know
i
meant
young
folks
do
remember
as
well
as
older
people
do
continued
the
squire
i
do
see
what
so
remarkable
in
her
back
and
walkin
with
joe
louden
she
used
to
go
round
with
him
all
the
time
before
she
left
here
and
yet
everybody
talks
as
if
they
never
heard
of
sech
a
thing
it
seems
to
me
said
colonel
flitcroft
hesitatingly
that
she
did
right
i
know
it
sounds
kind
of
a
queer
thing
to
say
and
i
stirred
up
a
good
deal
of
opposition
at
home
yesterday
evening
by
sort
of
mentioning
something
of
the
kind
nobody
seemed
to
agree
with
me
except
norbert
and
he
did
say
much
but
he
was
interrupted
by
an
uncontrollable
cackle
which
issued
from
the
mouth
of
arp
the
colonel
turned
upon
him
with
a
frown
inquiring
the
cause
of
his
mirth
it
put
me
in
mind
arp
began
promptly
of
something
that
happened
last
night
what
was
it
eskew
mouth
was
open
to
tell
but
he
remembered
just
in
time
that
the
grandfather
of
norbert
was
not
the
audience
properly
to
be
selected
for
this
recital
choked
a
word
coughed
loudly
realizing
that
he
must
withhold
the
story
of
the
felling
of
martin
pike
until
the
colonel
had
taken
his
departure
and
replied
nothin
to
speak
of
go
on
with
your
argument
i
finished
said
the
colonel
i
only
wanted
to
say
that
it
seems
to
me
a
good
action
for
a
young
lady
like
that
to
come
back
here
and
stick
to
her
old
friend
and
playmate
stick
to
him
echoed
arp
she
walked
up
main
street
with
him
yesterday
do
you
call
that
stickin
to
him

good
while

till

sees
for
herself

his
standing
in
this
com
i
agree

once
interrupted
peter
bradbury
i

because
then
you
better
wait
cried
eskew
allowing
him
to
proceed
no
farther
till
you
hear
what
you
agreein
to
i
say
you
take
a
young
lady
like
that
pretty
and
rich
and
all
cultured
up
and
it
stands
to
reason
that
she
wo
no
it
do
exclaimed
buckalew
impatiently
nothing
of
the
sort
i
tell
you
eskew
rose
to
his
feet
and
pounded
the
pavement
with
his
stick
it
stands
to
reason
that
she
wo
stick
to
a
man
no
other
decent
woman
will
speak
to
a
feller
that
been
the
mark
for
every
stone
throwed
in
the
town
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
an
outcast
with
a
reputation
as
black
as
a
preacher
shoes
on
sunday
i
do
care
if
he
her
oldest
friend
on
earth
she
wo
stick
to
him
she
walked
with
him
yesterday
but
you
can
mark
my
words
his
goose
is
cooked
the
old
man
voice
rose
shrill
and
high
it
ai
in
human
nature
fer
her
to
do
it
you
hear
what
i
say
you
never
see
her
with
joe
louden
again
in
this
livin
world
and
she
as
good
as
told
me
so
herself
last
night
you
can
take
your
oath
she
quit
him
already
do
eskew
paused
abruptly
his
eyes
widening
behind
his
spectacles
his
jaw
fell
his
stick
raised
to
hammer
the
pavement
remained
suspended
in
the
air
a
sudden
color
rushed
over
his
face
and
he
dropped
speechless
in
his
chair
the
others
after
staring
at
him
in
momentary
alarm
followed
the
direction
of
his
gaze
just
across
main
street
and
in
plain
view
was
the
entrance
to
the
stairway
which
led
to
joe
office
ariel
tabor
all
in
cool
gray
carrying
a
big
bunch
of
white
roses
in
her
hands
had
just
crossed
the
sidewalk
from
a
carriage
and
was
ascending
the
dark
stairway
a
moment
later
she
came
down
again
got
into
the
carriage
and
drove
away
she
missed
him
said
squire
buckalew
i
saw
him
go
out
half
an
hour
ago
but
he
added
and
exercising
a
close
upon
the
saintly
did
not
even
glance
toward
the
heap
which
was
arp
i
notice
she
left
her
flowers
ariel
was
not
the
only
one
who
climbed
the
dingy
stairs
that
day
and
read
the
pencilled
script
upon
joe
door
will
not
return
until
evening
j
louden
many
others
came
all
exceedingly
unlike
the
first
visitor
some
were
quick
and
watchful
dodging
into
the
narrow
entrance
furtively
some
smiled
contemptuously
as
long
as
they
were
in
view
of
the
street
drooping
wanly
as
they
reached
the
stairs
some
were
brazen
and
amused
and
some
were
thin
and
troubled
not
all
of
them
read
the
message
for
not
all
could
read
but
all
looked
curiously
through
the
door
at
the
many
roses
which
lifted
their
heads
delicately
from
a
on
joe
desk
to
scent
that
dusty
place
with
their
cool
breath
most
of
these
clients
after
a
grunt
of
disappointment
turned
and
went
away
though
there
were
a
few
either
unable
to
read
the
message
or
so
pressed
by
anxiety
that
they
disregarded
it
who
entered
the
room
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
the
absentee
there
were
plenty
of
chairs
in
the
office
now
bookcases
also
and
a
big
steel
safe
but
when
evening
came
and
the
final
gray
of
twilight
had
vanished
from
the
all
had
gone
except
one
a
woman
who
sat
patiently
her
eyes
upon
the
floor
and
her
hands
folded
in
her
lap
until
the
footsteps
of
the
last
of
the
others
to
depart
had
ceased
to
sound
upon
the
pavement
below
then
with
a
wordless
exclamation
she
sprang
to
her
feet
pulled
the
carefully
down
to
the
sill
and
when
she
had
done
that
struck
a
match
on
the
heel
of
her
shoe
a
soiled
white
canvas
shoe
not
a
small
one
and
applied
the
flame
to
a
gas
jet
the
yellow
light
flared
up
and
she
began
to
pace
the
room
haggardly
the
bell
rang
nine
and
as
the
tremors
following
the
last
stroke
pulsed
themselves
into
silence
she
heard
a
footfall
on
the
stairs
and
immediately
relapsed
into
a
chair
folding
her
hands
again
in
her
lap
her
expression
composing
itself
to
passivity
for
the
step
was
very
much
lighter
than
joe
a
lady
beautifully
dressed
in
white
dimity
appeared
in
the
doorway
she
hesitated
at
the
threshold
not
apparently
because
of
any
timidity
her
expression
being
too
thoughtfully
assured
for
that
but
almost
immediately
she
came
in
and
seated
herself
near
the
desk
acknowledging
the
other
presence
by
a
slight
inclination
of
the
head
this
grave
courtesy
caused
a
strong
deep
flush
to
spread
itself
under
the
rouge
which
unevenly
covered
the
woman
cheeks
as
she
bowed
elaborately
in
return
then
furtively
during
a
protracted
silence
she
took
stock
of
the
from
the
tip
of
her
white
suede
shoes
to
the
filmy
lace
and
pink
roses
upon
her
wide
white
hat
and
the
sidelong
gaze
lingered
marvellingly
upon
the
quiet
delicate
hands
slender
and
finely
expressive
in
their
white
gloves
her
own
hands
unlike
the
lady
began
to
fidget
confusedly
and
the
silence
continuing
she
coughed
several
times
to
effect
the
preface
required
by
her
sense
of
fitness
before
she
felt
it
proper
to
observe
with
a
polite
titter
louden
seems
to
be
a
good
while
comin
have
you
been
waiting
very
long
asked
the
lady
ever
since
six
yes
said
the
other
that
is
very
long
yes
it
is
the
ice
thus
broken
she
felt
free
to
use
her
eyes
more
directly
and
after
a
long
frank
stare
exclaimed
why
you
must
be
miss
ariel
tabor
ai
you
yes
ariel
touched
one
of
the
roses
upon
joe
desk
with
her
i
am
miss
tabor
well
excuse
me
fer
asking
i
sure
it
ai
any
business
of
mine
said
the
other
remembering
the
manners
due
one
lady
from
another
but
i
thought
it
must
be
i
expect
she
added
with
loud
inconsequent
laughter
there
not
many
in
canaan
ai
heard
come
back
she
paused
laughed
again
nervously
and
again
less
loudly
to
take
off
the
edge
of
her
abruptness
gradually
tittering
herself
down
to
a
pause
to
fill
which
she
put
forth
right
nice
weather
we
havin
yes
said
ariel
it
was
rainy
first
of
last
week
though
do
mind
rain
so
much
this
with
more
laughter
i
stay
in
the
house
when
it
rains
some
people
do
know
enough
to
they
say
you
heard
that
saying
ai
you
miss
tabor
yes
well
i
tell
you
she
exclaimed
noisily
there
plenty
ladies
and
in
this
town
that
like
that
her
laughter
did
not
cease
it
became
louder
and
shriller
it
had
been
until
now
a
mere
lubrication
of
the
conversation
helping
to
make
her
easier
in
miss
tabor
presence
but
as
it
increased
in
shrillness
she
seemed
to
be
losing
control
of
herself
as
if
her
laughter
were
getting
away
with
her
she
was
not
far
from
hysteria
when
it
stopped
with
a
gasp
and
she
sat
up
straight
in
her
chair
white
and
rigid
there
she
said
listening
intently
ai
that
him
steps
sounded
upon
the
pavement
below
paused
for
a
second
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
was
the
snap
of
a
match
then
the
steps
sounded
again
retreating
she
sank
back
in
her
chair
limply
it
was
only
some
one
stoppin
to
light
his
cigar
in
the
entry
it
was
joe
louden
step
anyway
you
know
his
step
ariel
eyes
were
bent
upon
the
woman
wonderingly
i
know
it
was
the
answer
delivered
with
a
sharp
and
painful
giggle
i
got
plenty
reason
to
ariel
did
not
respond
she
leaned
a
little
closer
to
the
roses
upon
the
desk
letting
them
touch
her
face
and
breathing
deeply
of
their
fragrance
to
neutralize
a
perfume
which
pervaded
the
room
an
odor
as
heavy
and
as
the
face
of
the
woman
who
had
saturated
her
handkerchief
with
it
a
scent
which
went
with
her
perfectly
and
made
her
unhappily
definite
suited
to
her
clumsily
dyed
hair
to
her
soiled
white
shoes
to
the
hot
red
hat
smothered
in
plumage
to
the
restless
hands
to
the
fat
plated
rings
of
which
she
wore
a
great
quantity
though
surprisingly
enough
the
large
diamonds
in
her
ears
were
pure
and
of
a
very
clear
water
it
was
she
who
broke
the
silence
once
more
well
she
drawled
coughing
genteelly
at
the
same
time
better
late
than
never
as
the
saying
is
i
wonder
who
it
is
gits
up
all
them
comical
sayings
apparently
she
had
no
genuine
desire
for
light
upon
this
mystery
as
she
continued
immediately
i
have
a
friend
that
always
gittin
off
he
says
best
of
friends
must
part
and
strikest
me
to
the
heart
all
kinds
of
cracks
like
that
he
real
comical
and
yet
she
went
on
in
an
altered
voice
i
like
him
much
i
be
glad
if
i
never
seen
him
the
change
of
tone
was
so
marked
that
ariel
looked
at
her
keenly
to
find
herself
surprised
into
pitying
this
strange
client
of
joe
for
tears
had
sprung
to
the
woman
eyes
and
slid
along
the
lids
where
she
tried
vainly
to
restrain
them
her
face
had
altered
too
like
her
voice
haggard
lines
suddenly
appearing
about
the
eyes
and
mouth
as
if
they
had
just
been
pencilled
there
the
truth
issuing
from
beneath
her
pinchbeck
simulations
like
a
tragic
mask
revealed
by
the
displacement
of
a
tawdry
covering
i
expect
you
think
i
real
foolish
she
said
but
i
waitin
so
awful
long
and
i
got
a
good
deal
of
worry
on
my
mind
till
i
see
mr
louden
i
am
sorry
ariel
turned
from
the
roses
and
faced
her
and
the
heavy
perfume
i
hope
he
will
come
soon
i
hope
so
said
the
other
it
something
to
do
with
me
that
keeps
him
away
and
the
longer
he
is
the
more
it
scares
me
she
shivered
and
set
her
teeth
together
it
kind
of
hard
waitin
i
got
my
share
of
troubles
do
you
think
that
louden
will
be
able
to
take
care
of
them
for
you
oh
i
hope
so
miss
tabor
if
he
ca
nobody
can
she
was
crying
openly
now
wiping
her
eyes
with
her
handkerchief
we
had
to
send
fer
him
yesterday
afternoon
to
come
to
beaver
beach
do
you
mean
asked
ariel
leaning
forward
yes
it
all
begun
out
there
it
begun
before
that
with
me
it
was
all
my
fault
i
deserve
all
that
comin
to
me
i
guess
i
done
wrong
i
done
wrong
i
ought
never
to
of
went
out
there
yesterday
she
checked
herself
sharply
but
after
a
moment
pause
continued
encouraged
by
the
grave
kindliness
of
the
delicate
face
in
the
shadow
of
the
wide
white
hat
i
ought
to
of
went
she
repeated
oh
i
reckon
i
never
never
learn
enough
to
keep
out
o
trouble
even
when
i
see
it
comin
but
that
gentleman
friend
of
mine
nashville
cory
his
name
he
kind
o
coaxed
me
into
it
and
he
right
comical
when
he
with
ladies
and
he
good
company
and
he
says
we
dance
the
light
fantastic
he
says
and
i
kind
o
wanted
something
cheerful
i
workin
steady
quite
a
spell
and
it
looked
like
he
wanted
to
show
me
a
good
time
so
i
went
and
what
started
it
now
that
she
had
begun
she
babbled
on
with
her
story
at
times
incoherently
full
of
excuses
made
to
herself
more
than
to
ariel
pitifully
endeavoring
to
convince
herself
that
the
responsibility
for
the
muddle
she
had
made
was
not
hers
cory
told
me
my
husband
was
drinkin
and
would
know
about
it
and
he
says
the
odds
of
course
i
knowed
there
was
trouble
between
him
and
mr
fear
that
my
husband
a
good
while
ago
when
mr
fear
up
and
laid
him
out
that
was
before
me
and
mr
fear
got
married
i
had
even
to
canaan
then
i
was
on
the
stage
i
was
on
the
stage
quite
a
while
in
chicago
before
i
got
acquainted
with
my
husband
you
were
on
the
stage
ariel
exclaimed
involuntarily
yes
livin
pitchers
at
goldberg
and
amunchoor
nights
i
nearly
always
done
a
sketch
with
a
friend
the
way
i
met
mr
fear
he
seemed
to
be
real
struck
with
me
right
away
and
soon
as
i
got
through
my
turn
he
ast
me
to
order
whatever
i
wanted
he
always
when
he
ai
had
too
much
and
even
then
he
vurry
vurry
seldom
acks
rough
unless
he
jealous
that
was
the
trouble
yesterday
i
never
would
of
gone
to
the
beach
if
i
dreamed
what
was
comin
when
we
got
there
i
saw
mike
that
the
that
runs
the
beach
lookin
at
my
company
and
me
kind
of
anxious
and
pretty
soon
he
got
me
away
from
cory
and
told
me
what
what
seems
this
cory
only
wanted
me
to
go
with
him
to
make
my
husband
mad
and
he
took
good
care
that
mr
fear
heard
i
be
there
with
him
and
he
hangin
around
me
every
time
he
struck
town
jest
to
make
mr
fear
mad
the
fresh
thing
you
see
he
wanted
to
make
my
husband
start
something
again
this
cory
did
and
he
was
fixed
for
it
i
do
understand
said
ariel
it
this
way
if
mr
fear
attacted
cory
why
cory
could
shoot
him
down
and
claim
you
see
it
would
be
easy
for
cory
because
mr
fear
nearly
killed
him
when
they
had
their
first
trouble
and
that
would
give
cory
a
good
excuse
to
shoot
if
mr
fear
jest
only
pushed
him
that
the
way
it
is
with
the
law
cory
could
wipe
out
their
old
score
and
git
off
surely
not
yes
that
the
way
it
would
be
and
when
mike
told
me
that
cory
had
got
me
out
there
jest
to
provoke
my
husband
i
went
straight
up
to
him
and
begun
to
give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
i
talk
loud
because
i
never
was
one
to
make
a
disturbance
and
start
trouble
the
way
some
do
and
right
while
i
was
talkin
we
both
see
my
husband
pass
the
window
cory
give
a
kind
of
yelling
laugh
and
put
his
arm
round
me
jest
as
mr
fear
come
in
the
door
and
then
it
all
happened
so
quick
that
you
could
hardly
tell
what
was
goin
on
mr
fear
we
found
afterwards
had
promised
louden
that
he
come
out
there
but
he
took
too
much
you
could
see
that
by
the
look
of
him
and
fergot
his
promise
fergot
everything
but
me
and
cory
i
guess
he
come
right
up
to
us
where
i
was
tryin
to
git
away
from
arm
it
was
the
left
one
he
had
around
me
and
the
other
behind
his
back
and
neither
of
said
a
word
cory
kept
on
laughin
loud
as
he
could
and
mr
fear
struck
him
in
the
mouth
he
little
but
he
can
hit
awful
hard
and
cory
let
out
a
screech
and
i
see
his
gun
go
off
right
in
mr
fear
face
i
thought
but
it
was
it
only
scorched
him
most
of
the
other
had
run
but
mike
made
a
dive
and
managed
to
knock
the
gun
to
one
side
jest
barely
in
time
then
mike
and
three
or
four
others
that
come
out
from
behind
things
separated
both
of
fightin
to
git
at
each
other
they
locked
cory
up
in
mike
room
and
took
mr
fear
over
to
where
they
hitch
the
horses
then
mike
sent
fer
louden
to
come
out
to
talk
to
my
husband
and
take
care
of
him
he
the
only
one
can
do
anything
with
him
when
he
like
that
but
before
louden
could
git
there
mr
fear
broke
loose
and
run
through
a
and
got
away
at
least
they
could
find
him
and
cory
jumped
through
a
window
and
slid
down
into
one
of
mike
boats
so
they
both
gone
when
louden
come
he
only
stayed
long
enough
to
hear
what
had
happened
and
started
out
to
find
happy
that
my
husband
he
bound
to
keep
them
apart
but
he
has
found
mr
fear
yet
or
he
be
here
ariel
had
sunk
back
in
her
chair
why
should
your
husband
hide
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
waitin
fer
his
chance
at
cory
the
woman
answered
huskily
i
expect
he
afraid
the
cops
are
after
him
too
on
account
of
the
trouble
and
he
does
want
to
git
locked
up
till
he
met
cory
again
they
ai
after
him
but
he
may
not
know
it
they
have
heard
of
the
trouble
i
reckon
or
they
of
run
cory
in
he
around
town
drinkin
heavy
and
i
guess
he
lookin
fer
mr
fear
about
as
hard
as
louden
is
she
rose
to
her
feet
lifted
her
coarse
hands
and
dropped
them
despairingly
oh
i
scared
she
said
mr
fear
mighty
good
to
me
a
slow
and
tired
footstep
was
heard
upon
the
stairs
and
joe
dog
ran
into
the
room
droopingly
wagged
his
tail
with
no
energy
and
crept
under
the
desk
mrs
fear
wheeled
toward
the
door
and
stood
rigid
her
hands
clenched
tight
her
whole
body
still
except
her
breast
which
rose
and
fell
with
her
tumultuous
breathing
she
could
not
wait
till
the
laggard
step
reached
the
landing
mr
louden
she
called
suddenly
joe
voice
came
from
the
stairway
it
all
right
claudine
all
fixed
up
do
worry
mrs
fear
gave
a
thick
cry
of
relief
and
sank
back
in
her
chair
as
joe
entered
the
room
he
came
in
shamblingly
with
his
hand
over
his
eyes
as
if
they
were
very
tired
and
the
light
hurt
them
so
that
for
a
moment
or
two
he
did
not
perceive
the
second
visitor
then
he
let
his
hand
fall
revealing
a
face
very
white
and
worn
it
all
right
claudine
he
repeated
it
all
right
he
was
moving
to
lay
his
hat
on
the
desk
when
his
eye
caught
first
the
roses
then
fell
upon
ariel
and
he
stopped
with
one
arm
outstretched
remaining
for
perhaps
ten
seconds
in
that
attitude
while
she
her
lips
parted
her
eyes
lustrous
returned
his
gaze
with
a
look
that
was
as
inscrutable
as
it
was
kind
yes
she
said
as
if
in
answer
to
a
question
i
have
come
here
twice
she
nodded
slightly
toward
mrs
fear
i
can
wait
i
am
very
glad
you
bring
good
news
joe
turned
dazedly
toward
the
other
claudine
he
said
you
been
telling
miss
tabor
i
have
mrs
fear
expression
had
cleared
and
her
tone
was
cheerful
i
do
see
no
harm
in
that
i
sure
she
a
good
friend
of
yours
mr
louden
joe
glanced
at
ariel
with
a
faint
troubled
smile
and
turned
again
to
mrs
fear
i
had
a
long
talk
with
happy
i
awful
glad
is
he
ready
to
listen
to
reason
she
asked
with
a
titter
he
waiting
for
you
where
she
rose
quickly
stop
said
joe
sharply
you
must
be
very
careful
with
him
do
you
i
goin
to
be
she
interrupted
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
do
you
i
had
trouble
enough
no
said
joe
deliberately
and
impersonally
i
do
unless
you
keep
remembering
to
be
careful
all
the
time
you
follow
the
first
impulse
you
have
as
you
did
yesterday
and
your
excuse
will
be
that
you
never
thought
any
harm
would
come
of
it
he
in
a
queer
mood
but
he
will
forgive
you
if
you
ask
him
well
ai
that
what
i
want
to
do
she
exclaimed
i
know
i
know
he
said
dropping
into
the
and
passing
his
hand
over
his
eyes
with
a
gesture
of
infinite
weariness
but
you
must
be
very
careful
i
hunted
for
him
most
of
the
night
and
all
day
he
was
trying
to
keep
out
of
my
way
because
he
did
want
me
to
find
him
until
he
had
met
this
fellow
nashville
happy
is
a
hard
man
to
come
at
when
he
does
care
to
be
found
and
he
kept
shifting
from
place
to
place
until
i
ran
him
down
then
i
got
him
in
a
corner
and
told
him
that
you
had
meant
any
harm
which
is
always
true
of
you
poor
woman
and
i
did
leave
him
till
he
had
promised
me
to
forgive
you
if
you
would
come
and
ask
him
and
you
must
keep
him
out
of
cory
way
until
i
can
arrange
to
have
him
cory
i
mean
sent
out
of
town
will
you
why
she
answered
smiling
that
nashville
the
vurry
last
person
i
ever
want
to
see
again
the
fresh
thing
mrs
burden
had
fallen
her
relief
was
perfect
and
she
beamed
vapidly
but
joe
marked
her
renewed
irresponsibility
with
an
anxious
eye
you
must
make
any
mistakes
he
said
rising
stiffly
with
fatigue
not
me
do
take
no
more
chances
she
responded
tittering
happily
not
after
yesterday
my
but
it
a
load
off
my
shoulders
i
do
hate
it
to
have
quarrelling
over
me
especially
mr
fear
i
never
did
like
to
start
anything
i
like
to
see
people
laugh
and
be
friendly
and
i
mighty
glad
it
all
blown
over
i
kind
thought
it
would
all
along
psho
she
burst
into
genuine
noisy
laughter
i
do
expect
either
of
meant
no
real
harm
to
each
other
after
they
got
cooled
off
a
little
if
they
met
they
probably
both
run
now
louden
where
happy
joe
went
to
the
door
with
her
he
waited
a
moment
perplexed
then
his
brow
cleared
and
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
know
the
alley
beyond
vent
miller
go
down
the
alley
till
you
come
to
the
second
gate
go
in
and
you
see
a
basement
door
opening
into
a
little
room
under
miller
bar
the
door
wo
be
locked
and
happy
in
there
waiting
for
you
but
remember
oh
do
you
worry
she
cut
him
off
loudly
i
know
him
inside
of
an
hour
i
have
him
laughin
over
all
this
you
see
when
she
had
gone
he
stood
upon
the
landing
looking
thoughtfully
after
her
perhaps
after
all
that
is
the
best
mood
to
let
her
meet
him
in
he
murmured
then
with
a
deep
breath
he
turned
the
heavy
perfume
had
gone
the
air
was
clear
and
sweet
and
ariel
was
pressing
her
face
into
the
roses
again
as
he
saw
how
like
them
she
was
he
was
shaken
with
a
profound
and
mysterious
sigh
like
that
which
moves
in
the
breast
of
one
who
listens
in
the
dark
to
his
dearest
music
xv
happy
fear
gives
himself
up
i
know
how
tired
you
are
said
ariel
as
he
came
back
into
the
room
i
shall
not
keep
you
long
ah
please
do
he
returned
quickly
beginning
to
fumble
with
the
shade
of
a
at
one
end
of
the
desk
let
me
do
that
she
said
sit
down
he
obeyed
at
once
and
watched
her
as
she
lit
the
lamp
and
stretching
upon
tiptoe
turned
out
the
gas
no
she
continued
seated
again
and
looking
across
the
desk
at
him
i
wanted
to
see
you
at
the
first
possible
opportunity
but
what
i
have
to
say
wait
he
interrupted
let
me
tell
you
why
i
did
not
come
yesterday
you
need
not
tell
me
i
know
she
glanced
at
the
chair
which
had
been
occupied
by
mrs
fear
i
knew
last
night
that
they
had
sent
for
you
you
did
he
exclaimed
ah
i
understand
sam
warden
must
have
told
you
yes
she
said
it
was
he
and
i
have
been
wondering
ever
since
how
he
heard
of
it
he
knew
last
night
but
there
was
nothing
in
the
papers
this
morning
and
until
i
came
here
i
heard
no
one
else
speak
of
it
yet
canaan
is
not
large
joe
laughed
it
would
seem
strange
if
you
lived
with
the
canaan
that
i
do
sam
had
been
during
the
afternoon
and
had
met
friends
the
colored
people
are
a
good
deal
like
a
freemasonry
you
know
a
great
many
knew
last
night
all
about
what
had
happened
and
had
their
theories
about
what
might
happen
in
case
the
two
men
met
still
you
see
those
who
knew
also
knew
just
what
people
not
to
tell
the
tocsin
is
the
only
newspaper
worth
the
name
here
but
even
if
the
tocsin
had
known
of
the
trouble
it
would
have
been
likely
to
mention
it
that
a
thing
i
do
understand
he
frowned
and
rubbed
the
back
of
his
head
there
something
underneath
it
for
more
than
a
year
the
tocsin
has
spoken
of
beaver
beach
i
like
to
know
why
joe
she
said
slowly
tell
me
something
truly
a
man
said
to
me
yesterday
that
he
found
life
here
insufferable
do
you
find
it
so
why
no
he
answered
surprised
do
you
hate
canaan
certainly
not
you
do
find
it
dull
provincial
unsympathetic
he
laughed
cheerily
well
there
this
he
explained
i
have
an
advantage
over
your
friend
i
see
a
more
interesting
side
of
things
probably
the
people
i
live
among
are
pretty
thorough
cosmopolites
in
a
way
and
the
life
i
lead
i
think
i
begin
to
understand
a
little
about
the
life
you
lead
she
interrupted
then
you
do
complain
of
canaan
of
course
not
she
threw
him
a
quick
bright
happy
look
then
glanced
again
at
the
chair
in
which
mrs
fear
had
sat
joe
she
said
last
night
i
heard
the
people
singing
in
the
houses
the
old
way
it
me
back
so
yes
it
would
and
something
else
there
one
hymn
they
sing
more
than
any
other
it
canaan
favorite
do
you
know
what
it
is
is
it
the
perishing
that
it
the
perishing
he
cried
and
repeating
the
words
again
gave
forth
a
peal
of
laughter
so
hearty
that
it
brought
tears
to
his
eyes
the
perishing
at
first
she
did
not
understand
his
laughter
but
after
a
moment
she
did
and
joined
her
own
to
it
though
with
a
certain
tremulousness
it
is
funny
is
it
said
joe
wiping
the
moisture
from
his
eyes
then
all
trace
of
mirth
left
him
is
it
really
you
sitting
here
and
laughing
with
me
ariel
it
seems
to
be
she
answered
in
a
low
voice
i
not
at
all
sure
you
did
think
yesterday
afternoon
he
began
almost
in
a
whisper
you
did
think
that
i
had
failed
to
come
because
i
he
grew
very
red
and
shifted
the
sentence
awkwardly
i
was
afraid
you
might
think
that
i
was
that
i
did
come
because
i
might
have
been
the
same
way
again
that
i
was
when
when
i
met
you
at
the
station
oh
no
she
answered
gently
no
i
knew
better
and
do
you
know
he
faltered
that
that
is
all
over
that
it
can
never
happen
again
yes
i
know
it
she
returned
quickly
then
you
know
a
little
of
what
i
owe
you
no
no
she
protested
yes
he
said
you
made
that
change
in
me
already
it
hard
it
wo
be
though
it
might
have
been
if
if
you
had
come
soon
tell
me
something
she
demanded
if
these
people
had
not
sent
for
you
yesterday
would
you
have
come
to
judge
pike
house
to
see
me
you
said
you
would
try
she
laughed
a
little
and
looked
away
from
him
i
want
to
know
if
you
would
have
come
there
was
a
silence
and
in
spite
of
her
averted
glance
she
knew
that
he
was
looking
at
her
steadily
finally
do
you
know
he
said
she
shook
her
head
and
blushed
faintly
do
you
know
he
repeated
she
looked
up
and
met
his
eyes
and
thereupon
both
became
very
grave
yes
i
do
she
answered
you
would
have
come
when
you
left
me
at
the
gate
and
went
away
you
were
afraid
but
you
would
have
come
yes
i
have
come
you
are
right
i
was
afraid
at
first
but
i
knew
he
went
on
rapidly
that
you
would
have
come
to
the
gate
to
meet
me
you
understood
that
she
cried
her
eyes
sparkling
and
her
face
flushing
happily
yes
i
knew
that
you
would
have
asked
me
to
come
he
said
with
a
catch
in
his
voice
which
was
half
chuckle
half
groan
if
you
meant
to
take
care
of
me
and
it
came
to
me
that
you
would
know
how
to
do
it
she
leaned
back
in
her
chair
and
again
they
laughed
together
but
only
for
a
moment
becoming
serious
and
very
quiet
almost
instantly
i
have
thanked
you
for
the
roses
he
said
oh
yes
you
did
when
you
first
looked
at
them
so
i
did
he
whispered
i
glad
you
saw
to
find
them
here
took
my
breath
away
and
to
find
you
with
them
i
brought
them
this
morning
you
know
would
you
have
come
if
you
had
not
understood
why
i
failed
yesterday
oh
yes
i
think
so
she
returned
the
fine
edge
of
a
smile
upon
her
lips
for
a
time
last
evening
before
i
heard
what
had
happened
i
thought
you
were
too
frightened
a
friend
to
bother
about
he
made
a
little
ejaculation
partly
joyful
partly
sad
and
yet
she
went
on
i
think
that
i
should
have
come
this
morning
after
all
even
if
you
had
a
poorer
excuse
for
your
absence
because
you
see
i
came
on
business
you
did
that
why
i
come
again
that
makes
it
respectable
for
me
to
be
here
now
does
it
for
me
to
have
come
out
alone
after
dark
without
their
knowing
it
i
here
as
your
client
joe
why
he
asked
she
did
not
answer
at
once
but
picked
up
a
pen
from
beneath
her
hand
on
the
desk
and
turning
it
meditatively
felt
its
point
with
her
forefinger
before
she
said
slowly
are
most
men
careful
of
other
people
well
of
other
people
money
you
mean
martin
pike
he
asked
yes
i
want
you
to
take
charge
of
everything
i
have
for
me
he
bent
a
frowning
regard
upon
the
you
ought
to
look
after
your
own
property
he
said
you
surely
have
plenty
of
time
you
mean
you
mean
you
wo
help
me
she
returned
with
intentional
pathos
ariel
he
laughed
shortly
in
answer
then
asked
what
makes
you
think
judge
pike
is
trustworthy
nothing
very
definite
perhaps
unless
it
was
his
look
when
i
told
him
that
i
meant
to
ask
you
to
take
charge
of
things
for
me
he
been
rather
hard
pressed
this
year
i
think
said
joe
you
might
be
right
if
he
could
have
found
a
way
i
hope
he
has
i
afraid
she
began
gayly
that
i
know
very
little
of
my
own
affairs
he
sent
me
a
draft
every
three
months
with
receipts
and
other
things
to
sign
and
return
to
him
i
have
the
faintest
notion
of
what
i
own
except
the
old
house
and
some
money
from
the
income
that
i
had
used
and
brought
with
me
judge
pike
has
all
the
papers
everything
joe
looked
troubled
and
roger
tabor
did
he
the
dear
man
she
shook
her
head
he
was
just
the
same
to
him
poor
uncle
jonas
money
seemed
to
come
from
heaven
through
the
hands
of
judge
pike
and
there
a
handsome
roundabout
way
said
joe
was
it
she
agreed
cheerfully
and
he
trusted
the
judge
absolutely
i
do
you
see
he
gave
her
a
thoughtful
look
and
nodded
no
he
is
a
good
man
he
said
not
even
according
to
his
lights
but
i
doubt
if
he
could
have
managed
to
get
away
with
anything
of
consequence
after
he
became
the
administrator
he
would
have
tried
it
probably
unless
he
was
more
desperately
pushed
than
i
think
he
has
been
it
would
have
been
too
dangerous
suppose
you
wait
a
week
or
so
and
think
it
over
but
there
something
i
want
you
to
do
for
me
immediately
joe
what
that
i
want
the
old
house
put
in
order
i
going
to
live
there
alone
i
almost
and
that
being
enough
of
an
old
maid
for
me
to
risk
canaan
thinking
me
eccentric
is
it
it
will
think
anything
you
do
is
all
right
and
once
she
cried
it
thought
everything
i
did
all
wrong
yes
that
the
difference
you
mean
it
will
commend
me
because
i
thought
rich
no
no
he
said
meditatively
it
is
that
it
because
everybody
will
be
in
love
with
you
quite
everybody
she
asked
certainly
he
replied
anybody
who
did
would
be
absurd
ah
joe
she
laughed
you
always
were
the
nicest
boy
in
the
world
my
dear
at
that
he
turned
toward
her
with
a
sudden
movement
and
his
lips
parted
but
not
to
speak
she
had
rested
one
arm
upon
the
desk
and
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
the
pen
she
had
picked
up
still
absently
held
in
her
fingers
touching
her
lips
and
it
was
given
to
him
to
know
that
he
would
always
keep
that
pen
though
he
would
never
write
with
it
again
the
soft
lamplight
fell
across
the
lower
part
of
her
face
leaving
her
eyes
which
were
lowered
thoughtfully
in
the
shadow
of
her
hat
the
room
was
blotted
out
in
darkness
behind
her
like
the
background
of
an
antique
portrait
the
office
with
its
dusty
corners
and
shelves
and
hideous
safe
had
vanished
leaving
the
charming
and
thoughtful
face
revealed
against
an
even
spacious
brownness
only
ariel
and
the
roses
and
the
lamp
were
clear
and
a
strange
small
pain
moved
from
heart
to
his
throat
as
he
thought
that
this
ugly
office
always
before
so
harsh
and
grim
and
lonely
loneliest
for
him
when
it
had
been
most
crowded
was
now
transfigured
into
something
very
very
different
from
an
office
that
this
place
where
he
sat
with
a
lamp
and
flowers
on
a
desk
between
him
and
a
woman
who
called
him
my
dear
must
be
like
like
something
that
people
called
home
and
then
he
leaned
across
the
desk
toward
her
as
he
said
again
what
he
had
said
a
little
while
before
and
his
voice
trembled
ariel
it
is
you
she
looked
at
him
and
smiled
you
be
here
always
wo
you
you
not
going
away
from
canaan
again
for
a
moment
it
seemed
that
she
had
not
heard
him
then
her
bright
glance
at
him
wavered
and
fell
she
rose
turning
slightly
away
from
him
but
not
so
far
that
he
could
not
see
the
sudden
agitation
in
her
face
ah
he
cried
rising
too
i
do
want
you
to
think
i
understand
or
that
i
meant
should
ever
ask
you
to
stay
here
i
could
mean
that
you
know
i
could
do
you
you
know
i
understand
that
it
all
just
your
beautiful
friendliness
do
you
it
is
beautiful
it
just
me
joe
she
said
it
could
be
any
other
way
it
enough
that
you
should
be
here
now
he
went
on
bravely
his
voice
steady
though
his
hand
shook
nothing
so
wonderful
as
your
staying
could
ever
actually
happen
it
just
a
light
coming
into
a
dark
room
and
out
again
one
day
long
ago
i
never
forgot
it
some
blew
by
me
as
i
passed
an
orchard
and
it
like
that
too
but
oh
my
dear
when
you
go
you
leave
a
fragrance
in
my
heart
that
will
last
she
turned
toward
him
her
face
suffused
with
a
rosy
light
rather
have
died
than
have
said
that
to
me
once
she
cried
i
glad
you
weak
enough
now
to
confess
it
he
sank
down
again
into
his
chair
and
his
arms
fell
heavily
on
the
desk
confess
it
he
cried
despairingly
and
you
do
deny
that
you
going
away
again
so
it
true
i
wish
i
had
realized
it
so
soon
i
think
i
rather
have
tried
to
fool
myself
about
it
a
little
longer
joe
she
cried
in
a
voice
of
great
pain
you
must
feel
like
that
how
do
you
know
i
going
away
again
why
should
i
want
the
old
house
put
in
order
unless
i
mean
to
stay
and
if
i
went
you
know
that
i
could
never
change
you
know
how
i
always
cared
for
you
yes
he
said
i
do
know
how
it
was
always
the
same
and
it
always
will
be
wo
it
i
shown
that
she
returned
quickly
yes
you
say
i
know
how
you
cared
for
me
and
i
do
i
know
how
it
just
in
one
certain
way
jonathan
and
david
is
that
a
pretty
good
way
joe
never
fear
that
i
do
understand
he
got
to
his
feet
again
and
looked
at
her
steadily
thank
you
joe
she
wiped
sudden
tears
from
her
eyes
do
you
be
sorry
for
me
he
said
do
you
think
that
the
love
of
women
is
enough
for
me
no
she
answered
humbly
i
have
people
at
work
on
the
old
house
he
began
and
for
the
i
kept
you
so
long
she
interrupted
helped
to
a
meek
sort
of
gayety
by
his
tone
joe
she
gave
him
her
hand
i
do
want
you
to
come
with
me
it
is
very
late
and
this
is
canaan
i
want
to
come
with
you
however
he
said
picking
up
his
hat
you
ca
go
alone
but
you
are
so
tired
you
she
was
interrupted
there
were
muffled
flying
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
a
shabby
little
man
ran
furtively
into
the
room
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
set
his
back
against
it
his
face
was
mottled
like
a
colored
map
thick
lines
of
perspiration
shining
across
the
splotches
joe
he
panted
i
got
nashville
good
and
he
got
me
good
too
i
got
to
clear
out
he
fixed
me
good
damn
him
but
he
trouble
nobody
joe
was
across
the
room
like
a
flying
shadow
quiet
his
voice
rang
like
a
shot
and
on
the
instant
his
hand
fell
sharply
across
the
speaker
mouth
in
there
happy
he
threw
an
arm
across
the
little
man
shoulders
and
swung
him
toward
the
door
of
the
other
room
happy
fear
looked
up
from
beneath
the
brim
of
his
black
slouch
hat
his
eyes
followed
an
imperious
gesture
toward
ariel
gave
her
a
brief
ghastly
stare
and
stumbled
into
the
inner
chamber
wait
joe
said
cavalierly
to
ariel
he
went
in
quickly
after
mr
fear
and
closed
the
door
this
was
joseph
louden
and
to
ariel
it
was
like
a
new
face
seen
in
a
not
at
all
the
face
of
joe
the
sense
of
his
strangeness
his
unfamiliarity
in
this
electrical
aspect
overcame
her
she
was
possessed
by
astonishment
did
she
know
him
so
well
after
all
the
strange
client
had
burst
in
shaken
beyond
belief
with
some
passion
unknown
to
her
but
joe
alert
and
masterful
beyond
denial
had
controlled
him
instantly
had
swept
him
into
the
other
room
as
with
a
broom
could
it
be
that
joe
sometimes
did
other
things
in
the
same
sweeping
fashion
she
heard
a
match
struck
in
the
next
room
and
the
voices
of
the
two
men
joe
then
the
other
the
latter
at
first
broken
and
protestive
but
soon
rising
shrilly
she
could
hear
only
fragments
once
she
heard
the
client
cry
almost
scream
by
god
joe
i
thought
claudine
had
chased
him
around
there
to
do
me
and
instantly
followed
louden
voice
steady
happy
steady
the
name
claudine
startled
her
and
although
she
had
had
no
comprehension
of
the
argot
of
happy
fear
the
sense
of
a
mysterious
catastrophe
oppressed
her
she
was
sure
that
something
horrible
had
happened
she
went
to
the
window
touched
the
shade
which
disappeared
upward
immediately
and
lifted
the
sash
the
front
of
a
square
building
in
the
square
was
bright
with
lights
and
figures
were
passing
in
and
out
of
the
main
street
doors
she
remembered
that
this
was
the
jail
claudine
the
voice
of
the
husband
of
claudine
was
like
the
voice
of
one
lamenting
over
jerusalem
steady
happy
steady
but
joe
if
they
git
me
what
she
do
she
ca
hold
her
job
no
longer
not
after
this
the
door
opened
and
the
two
men
came
out
joe
with
his
hand
on
the
other
shoulder
the
splotches
had
gone
from
happy
face
leaving
it
an
even
deathly
white
he
did
not
glance
toward
ariel
he
gazed
far
beyond
all
that
was
about
him
and
suddenly
she
was
aware
of
a
great
tragedy
the
little
man
chin
trembled
and
he
swallowed
painfully
nevertheless
he
bore
himself
upright
and
dauntlessly
as
the
two
walked
slowly
to
the
door
like
men
taking
part
in
some
fateful
ceremony
joe
stopped
upon
the
landing
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
but
happy
fear
went
on
clumping
heavily
down
the
steps
it
all
right
happy
said
joe
it
better
for
you
to
go
alone
do
you
worry
i
see
you
through
it
will
be
all
right
just
as
you
say
joe
a
breaking
voice
came
back
from
the
foot
of
the
steps
just
as
you
say
the
lawyer
turned
from
the
landing
and
went
rapidly
to
the
window
beside
ariel
together
they
watched
the
shabby
little
figure
cross
the
street
below
and
she
felt
an
infinite
pathos
gathering
about
it
as
it
paused
for
a
moment
hesitating
underneath
the
at
the
corner
they
saw
the
white
face
lifted
as
happy
fear
gave
one
last
look
about
him
then
he
set
his
shoulders
sturdily
and
steadfastly
entered
the
door
of
the
jail
joe
took
a
deep
breath
now
we
go
he
said
i
must
be
quick
what
was
it
she
asked
tremulously
as
they
reached
the
street
can
you
tell
me
nothing
just
an
old
story
he
had
not
offered
her
his
arm
but
walked
on
hurriedly
a
pace
ahead
of
her
though
she
came
as
rapidly
as
she
could
she
put
her
hand
rather
timidly
on
his
sleeve
and
without
need
of
more
words
from
her
he
understood
her
insistence
that
was
the
husband
of
the
woman
who
told
you
her
story
he
said
perhaps
it
would
shock
you
less
if
i
tell
you
now
than
if
you
heard
it
as
you
will
he
just
shot
the
other
man
killed
him
she
gasped
yes
he
answered
he
wanted
to
run
away
but
i
would
let
him
he
has
my
word
that
i
clear
him
and
i
made
him
give
himself
up
xvi
the
two
canaans
when
joe
left
ariel
at
judge
pike
gate
she
lingered
there
her
elbows
upon
the
uppermost
like
a
village
girl
at
twilight
watching
his
thin
figure
vanish
into
the
heavy
shadow
of
the
maples
then
emerge
momentarily
and
rapid
at
the
lighted
crossing
down
the
street
to
disappear
again
under
the
trees
beyond
followed
a
second
later
by
a
brownish
streak
as
the
mongrel
heeled
after
him
when
they
had
passed
the
second
corner
she
could
no
longer
be
certain
of
them
although
the
street
was
straight
with
flat
draughtsmanlike
western
directness
both
figures
and
joe
quick
footsteps
merging
with
the
night
still
she
did
not
turn
to
go
did
not
alter
her
position
nor
cease
to
gaze
down
the
dim
street
few
lights
shone
almost
all
the
windows
of
the
houses
were
darkened
and
save
for
the
summer
murmurs
the
faint
creak
of
upper
branches
and
the
infinitesimal
voices
of
insects
in
the
grass
there
was
silence
the
pleasant
and
somnolent
hush
swathed
in
which
that
part
of
canaan
crosses
to
the
far
side
of
the
eleventh
hour
but
ariel
not
soothed
by
this
balm
sought
beyond
it
to
see
that
unquiet
canaan
whither
her
old
friend
bent
his
steps
and
found
his
labor
and
his
dwelling
that
other
canaan
where
peace
did
not
fall
comfortably
with
the
coming
of
night
a
place
as
alien
in
habit
in
thought
and
almost
in
speech
as
if
it
had
been
upon
another
continent
and
yet
so
strange
is
the
duality
of
towns
it
lay
but
a
few
blocks
distant
here
about
ariel
as
she
stood
at
the
gate
of
the
pike
mansion
the
houses
of
the
good
secure
of
salvation
and
daily
bread
were
closed
and
quiet
as
safely
shut
and
sound
asleep
as
the
churches
but
deeper
in
the
town
there
was
light
and
life
and
merry
evil
industry
screened
but
strong
to
last
until
morning
there
were
haunts
of
haggard
merriment
in
plenty
surreptitious
chambers
where
swam
beneath
dizzied
eyes
bars
reached
by
devious
ways
where
quavering
voices
offered
song
and
were
harshly
checked
and
through
the
burdened
air
of
this
canaan
wandered
heavy
smells
of
musk
like
that
upon
happy
fear
wife
who
must
now
be
so
pale
beneath
her
rouge
and
above
all
this
and
for
all
this
and
because
of
all
this
was
that
one
resort
to
which
joe
now
made
his
way
that
haven
whose
lights
burn
all
night
long
whose
doors
are
never
closed
but
are
open
from
dawn
until
dawn
the
jail
there
in
that
desolate
refuge
lay
happy
fear
surrendered
sturdily
by
himself
at
joe
word
the
picture
of
the
little
man
was
clear
and
fresh
in
ariel
eyes
and
though
she
had
seen
him
when
he
was
newly
come
from
a
thing
so
terrible
that
she
could
not
realize
it
as
a
fact
she
felt
only
an
overwhelming
pity
for
him
she
was
not
even
though
she
had
shuddered
the
pathos
of
the
shabby
little
figure
crossing
the
street
toward
the
lighted
doors
had
touched
her
something
about
him
had
appealed
to
her
for
he
had
not
seemed
wicked
his
face
was
not
cruel
though
it
was
desperate
perhaps
it
was
partly
his
very
desperation
which
had
moved
her
she
had
understood
joe
when
he
told
her
that
this
man
was
his
friend
and
comprehended
his
great
fear
when
he
said
i
got
to
clear
him
i
promised
him
over
and
over
joe
had
reiterated
i
got
to
save
him
i
got
to
she
had
answered
gently
yes
joe
hurrying
to
keep
up
with
him
he
a
good
man
he
said
i
known
few
better
given
his
chances
and
none
of
this
would
have
happened
except
for
his
friendship
for
me
it
was
his
loyalty
oh
the
rarest
and
absurdest
loyalty
that
made
the
first
trouble
between
him
and
the
man
he
shot
i
got
to
clear
him
will
it
be
hard
they
may
make
it
so
i
can
only
see
part
of
it
surely
when
his
wife
left
the
office
she
met
cory
on
the
street
you
saw
what
a
pitiful
kind
of
fool
she
was
irresponsible
and
helpless
and
there
are
thousands
of
women
like
that
everywhere
some
of
them
are
beauties
i
dare
say
and
they
always
mix
things
up
but
they
are
most
dangerous
when
they
like
claudine
because
then
they
live
among
men
of
action
like
cory
and
fear
cory
was
artful
he
spent
the
day
about
town
telling
people
that
he
had
always
liked
happy
that
his
ill
feeling
of
yesterday
was
all
gone
he
wanted
to
find
him
and
shake
his
hand
bury
past
troubles
and
be
friends
i
think
he
told
claudine
the
same
thing
when
they
met
and
convinced
the
tiny
brainlet
of
his
sincerity
cory
was
a
man
who
a
way
with
him
and
i
can
see
claudine
flattered
at
the
idea
of
being
between
such
nice
as
cory
and
mr
fear
her
commonest
asseveration
quite
genuine
too
is
that
she
does
like
to
have
the
making
trouble
about
her
so
the
poor
imbecile
led
him
to
where
her
husband
was
waiting
all
that
happy
knew
of
this
was
in
her
cry
afterwards
he
was
sitting
alone
when
cory
threw
open
the
door
and
said
got
you
this
time
happy
his
pistol
was
raised
but
never
fired
he
waited
too
long
meaning
to
establish
his
case
of
and
fear
is
the
quickest
man
i
know
cory
fell
just
inside
the
door
claudine
stumbled
upon
him
as
she
came
running
after
him
crying
out
to
her
husband
that
she
meant
no
trouble
that
cory
had
sworn
to
her
that
he
only
wanted
to
shake
hands
and
up
other
people
heard
the
shot
and
broke
into
the
room
but
they
did
not
try
to
stop
fear
he
warned
them
off
and
walked
out
without
hindrance
and
came
to
me
i
got
to
clear
him
ariel
knew
what
he
meant
she
realized
the
actual
thing
as
it
was
and
though
possessed
by
a
strange
feeling
that
it
must
all
be
medieval
and
not
possibly
of
understood
that
he
would
have
to
fight
to
keep
his
friend
from
being
killed
that
the
unhappy
creature
who
had
run
into
the
office
out
of
the
dark
stood
in
high
danger
of
having
his
neck
broken
unless
joe
could
help
him
he
made
it
clear
to
her
that
the
state
would
kill
happy
if
it
could
that
it
would
be
a
point
of
pride
with
certain
deliberate
men
holding
office
to
take
the
life
of
the
little
man
that
if
they
did
secure
his
death
it
would
be
set
down
to
their
efficiency
and
was
even
competent
as
campaign
material
i
wish
to
point
out
joe
had
heard
a
candidate
for
vehemently
orate
that
in
addition
to
the
other
successful
convictions
i
have
named
i
and
my
assistants
have
achieved
the
sending
of
three
men
to
the
gallows
during
my
term
of
office
i
ca
tell
yet
said
joe
at
parting
it
may
be
hard
i
so
sorry
you
saw
all
this
i
oh
no
she
cried
i
want
to
understand
she
was
still
there
at
the
gate
her
elbows
resting
upon
the
when
a
long
time
after
joe
had
gone
there
came
from
the
alley
behind
the
big
back
yard
the
minor
chordings
of
a
quartette
of
those
dark
strollers
who
never
seem
to
go
to
bed
who
play
by
night
and
playfully
pretend
to
work
by
day
you
know
my
soul
is
o
mawn
i
cain
withouten
i
then
go
on
keep
walkin
on
these
times
is
an
i
am
sick
an
she
heard
a
step
upon
the
path
behind
her
and
turning
saw
a
figure
coming
toward
her
mamie
she
called
hush
mamie
lifted
a
warning
hand
the
windows
are
open
she
whispered
they
might
hear
you
why
have
you
gone
to
bed
oh
do
you
see
mamie
answered
in
deep
distress
i
been
sitting
up
for
you
we
all
thought
you
were
writing
letters
in
your
room
but
after
papa
and
mamma
had
gone
to
bed
i
went
in
to
tell
you
good
night
and
you
were
there
nor
anywhere
else
so
i
knew
you
must
have
gone
out
i
been
sitting
by
the
front
window
waiting
to
let
you
in
but
i
went
to
sleep
until
a
little
while
ago
when
the
rang
and
he
got
up
and
answered
it
he
kept
talking
a
long
time
it
was
something
about
the
tocsin
and
i
afraid
been
a
murder
when
he
went
back
to
bed
i
fell
asleep
again
and
then
those
darkies
woke
me
up
how
on
earth
did
you
expect
to
get
in
do
you
know
he
always
locks
up
the
house
i
could
have
rung
said
ariel
oh
oh
gasped
miss
pike
and
after
she
had
recovered
somewhat
asked
do
you
mind
telling
me
where
you
been
i
wo
tell
him
nor
mamma
either
i
think
after
all
i
was
wrong
yesterday
to
follow
eugene
advice
he
meant
for
the
best
but
i
do
think
that
you
were
wrong
ariel
put
her
arm
round
the
other
waist
i
went
to
talk
over
some
things
with
mr
louden
i
think
whispered
mamie
trembling
that
you
are
the
bravest
girl
i
ever
knew
and
and
i
could
almost
believe
there
some
good
in
him
since
you
like
him
so
i
know
there
is
and
i
i
think
he
had
a
hard
time
i
want
you
to
know
i
wo
even
tell
eugene
you
can
tell
everybody
in
the
world
said
ariel
and
kissed
her
xvii
sheehan
hints
never
said
the
tocsin
on
the
morrow
has
this
community
been
stirred
to
deeper
indignation
than
by
the
and
unmitigated
brutality
of
the
deliberate
murder
committed
almost
under
the
very
shadow
of
the
cupola
last
night
the
victim
was
not
a
man
of
good
repute
it
is
true
but
at
the
moment
of
his
death
he
was
in
the
act
of
performing
a
noble
and
generous
action
which
showed
that
he
might
have
become
if
he
lived
a
good
and
citizen
in
brief
he
went
to
forgive
his
enemy
and
was
stretching
forth
the
hand
of
fellowship
when
that
enemy
shot
him
down
not
half
an
hour
before
his
death
cory
had
repeated
within
the
hearing
of
a
dozen
men
what
he
had
been
saying
all
day
as
many
can
testify
want
to
find
my
old
friend
fear
and
shake
hands
with
him
i
want
to
tell
him
that
i
forgive
him
and
that
i
am
ashamed
of
whatever
has
been
my
part
in
the
trouble
between
us
he
went
with
that
intention
to
his
death
the
wife
of
the
murderer
has
confessed
that
this
was
the
substance
of
what
he
said
to
her
and
that
she
was
convinced
of
his
peaceful
intentions
when
they
reached
the
room
where
her
husband
was
waiting
for
her
cory
entered
first
the
woman
claims
now
that
as
they
neared
the
vicinity
he
hastened
forward
at
a
pace
which
she
could
not
equal
naturally
her
testimony
on
all
points
favoring
her
husband
is
practically
worthless
she
followed
and
heard
the
murdered
man
speak
though
what
his
words
were
she
declares
she
does
not
know
and
of
course
the
murderer
after
consultation
with
his
lawyer
claims
that
their
nature
was
threatening
such
a
statement
in
determining
the
truth
is
worse
than
valueless
it
is
known
and
readily
proved
that
fear
repeatedly
threatened
the
deceased
life
yesterday
and
there
is
no
question
in
the
mind
of
any
man
woman
or
child
who
reads
these
words
of
the
cold
blooded
nature
of
the
crime
the
slayer
who
had
formerly
made
a
murderous
attack
upon
his
victim
lately
quarrelled
with
him
and
uttered
threats
as
we
have
stated
upon
his
life
the
dead
man
came
to
him
with
protestations
of
friendship
and
was
struck
down
a
corpse
it
is
understood
that
the
defence
will
in
desperation
set
up
the
theory
of
based
on
an
unsubstantiated
claim
that
cory
entered
the
room
with
a
drawn
pistol
no
pistol
was
found
in
the
room
the
weapon
with
which
the
deed
was
accomplished
was
found
upon
the
person
of
the
murderer
when
he
was
seized
by
the
police
one
chamber
discharged
another
revolver
was
discovered
upon
the
person
of
the
woman
when
she
was
arrested
on
the
scene
of
the
crime
this
upon
being
strictly
interrogated
she
said
she
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
in
the
confusion
thinking
it
was
her
husband
and
hoping
to
conceal
it
the
chambers
were
full
and
undischarged
and
we
have
heard
it
surmised
that
the
defence
means
to
claim
that
it
was
cory
cory
doubtless
went
on
his
errand
of
forgiveness
unarmed
and
beyond
doubt
the
second
weapon
belonged
to
the
woman
herself
who
has
an
unenviable
record
the
point
of
it
all
is
plainly
this
here
is
an
unquestionable
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
the
people
of
this
city
and
county
are
outraged
and
incensed
that
such
a
crime
should
have
been
committed
in
their
and
respectable
community
with
whom
does
the
fault
lie
on
whose
head
is
this
murder
not
with
the
authorities
for
they
do
not
countenance
crime
has
it
come
to
the
pass
that
counting
on
juggleries
of
the
law
criminals
believe
that
they
may
kill
maim
burn
and
slay
as
they
list
without
punishment
is
this
to
be
another
instance
of
the
law
delays
and
immunity
for
a
hideous
crime
compassed
by
a
cunning
and
cynical
trickster
of
legal
technicalities
the
people
of
canaan
cry
out
for
a
speedy
trial
speedy
conviction
and
speedy
punishment
of
this
and
murderous
monster
if
he
is
not
dealt
with
quickly
according
to
his
deserts
the
climax
is
upon
us
and
the
limit
of
canaan
patience
has
been
reached
one
last
word
and
we
shall
be
glad
to
have
its
significance
noted
louden
has
been
retained
for
the
defence
the
murderer
before
being
apprehended
by
the
authorities
went
straight
from
the
scene
of
his
crime
to
place
his
retainer
in
his
attorney
pocket
how
long
is
this
to
last
the
tocsin
was
quoted
on
street
corners
that
morning
in
shop
and
store
and
office
wherever
people
talked
of
the
cory
murder
and
that
was
everywhere
for
the
people
of
canaan
and
of
the
country
roundabout
talked
of
nothing
else
women
chattered
of
it
in
parlor
and
kitchen
men
gathered
in
small
groups
on
the
street
and
shook
their
heads
ominously
over
it
farmers
meeting
on
the
road
halted
their
teams
and
loudly
damned
the
little
man
in
the
canaan
jail
milkmen
lingered
on
back
porches
over
their
cans
to
agree
with
cooks
that
it
was
an
awful
thing
and
that
if
ever
any
man
deserved
hanging
that
there
fear
deserved
it
his
lawyer
along
with
him
tipsy
men
hammered
bars
with
fists
and
inquiring
if
there
was
no
rope
to
be
had
in
the
town
and
joe
louden
returning
to
his
office
from
the
little
restaurant
where
he
sometimes
ate
his
breakfast
heard
hisses
following
him
along
main
street
a
clerk
a
youth
stood
in
the
open
doors
of
a
grocery
and
as
he
passed
stared
him
in
the
face
and
said
yah
with
supreme
disgust
joe
stopped
why
he
asked
mildly
the
clerk
put
two
fingers
in
his
mouth
and
whistled
shrilly
in
derision
you
ort
to
be
run
out
o
town
he
exclaimed
i
believe
said
joe
that
we
have
never
met
before
go
on
you
shyster
joe
looked
at
him
gravely
my
dear
sir
he
returned
you
speak
to
me
with
the
familiarity
of
an
old
friend
the
clerk
did
not
recover
so
far
as
to
be
capable
of
repartee
until
joe
had
entered
his
own
stairway
then
with
a
bitter
sneer
he
seized
a
bad
potato
from
an
open
barrel
and
threw
it
at
the
mongrel
who
had
paused
to
examine
the
landscape
the
missile
failed
and
respectability
after
bestowing
a
slightly
injured
look
upon
the
clerk
followed
his
master
in
the
office
the
man
sat
waiting
not
so
as
of
yore
however
was
sheehan
but
grizzled
and
gray
and
this
morning
gray
of
face
too
as
he
sat
perspiring
and
anxious
wiping
a
troubled
brow
with
a
black
silk
handkerchief
here
the
devil
and
all
to
pay
at
last
joe
he
said
uneasily
on
the
other
entrance
this
is
the
worst
i
ever
knew
and
i
hate
to
say
it
but
i
doubt
yer
pullin
it
off
i
got
to
mike
i
hope
on
my
soul

chanst
of
it
i
like
the
little
man
joe
so
do
i
i
know
ye
do
my

but
here
this
tocsin
kickin
up
the
public
sentiment
and
if
there
ever
was
a
follerin
sheep
on
earth
it
that
same
public
sentiment
if
it
were
for
that
joe
flung
himself
heavily
in
a
chair
there
not
be
so
much
trouble
it
a
clear
enough
case
but
do
ye
see
interrupted
sheehan
the
tocsin
tried
it
and
convicted
him
aforehand
and
that
if
things
keep
goin
the
way
started
the
gran
jury
bound
to
indict
him
and
the
trial
jury
to
convict
him
they
would
dare
not
to
what
more
want
to
and
they
rush
the
trial
summer
or
no
summer
and
i
know
i
know
i
tell
ye
one
thing
said
the
other
wiping
his
forehead
with
the
black
handkerchief
and
that
this
my
boy
last
night
business
has
just
about
put
the
cap
on
the
beach
fer
me
i
sick
of
it
and
tired
of
it
i
ready
to
quit
sir
joe
looked
at
him
sharply
do
you
think
my
old
notion
of
what
might
be
done
could
be
made
to
pay
sheehan
laughed
whoo
you
and
yer
hints
joe
how
long
past
have
ye
come
around
me
with
ye
c
make
more
money
mike
that
the
way
ye
put
it
ye
altered
the
beach
a
bit
make
a
little
restaurant
of
it
ye
say
have
good
cookin
and
keep
the
boys
and
girls
from
raisin
so
much
hell
out
there
soon
ye
have
other
people
comin
beside
the
regular
crowd
make
a
little
garden
on
the
shore
and
let
eat
at
tables
under
trees
an
well
why
not
asked
joe
have
i
been
tellin
ye
i
thinkin
of
it
it
only
yer
way
of
hintin
that
funny
to
me
yer
way
of
sayin
i
make
more
money
because
ye
afraid
of
preachin
at
any
of
us
partly
because
ye
know
the
little
good
it
be
and
partly
because
ye
have
humor
well
thinkin
ye
git
yer
way
i
willin
to
go
into
the
missionary
business
with
ye
mike
said
joe
angrily
but
he
grew
very
red
and
failed
to
meet
the
other
eye
i
not
yes
ye
are
cried
sheehan
yes
sir
it
a
thing
ye
have
had
the
nerve
to
say
to
yerself
since
a
boy
but
that
yer
notion
inside
ye
little
better
than
a
missionary
it
took
me
a
long
while
to
understand
what
was
drivin
ye
but
i
do
now
and
gone
the
right
way
about
it
because
we
know
ye
stand
fer
us
when
we
in
trouble
and
fight
fer
us
till
we
git
a
square
deal
as
goin
to
fight
for
happy
now
joe
looked
deeply
troubled
never
mind
he
said
crossly
and
with
visible
embarrassment
you
think
you
could
make
more
at
the
beach
if
you
ran
it
on
my
plan
i
game
to
try
said
sheehan
slowly
i
too
old
to
hold
down
out
there
the
way
i
yoosta
could
and
i
sick
of
it
sick
of
it
into
the
very
bones
of
me
he
wiped
his
forehead
where
claudine
held
as
a
witness
i
not
sorry
fer
her
said
the
man
emphatically
women
o
that
kind
are
so
it
a
wonder
they
do
float
think
of
her
pickin
up
cory
gun
from
the
floor
and
hidin
it
in
her
clothes
took
it
fer
granted
it
was
happy
and
thought
she
help
him
by
hidin
it
there
a
hard
point
fer
ye
joe
to
prove
the
gun
belonged
to
cory
there
nobody
about
here
could
swear
to
it
i
could
myself
though
i
forced
him
to
stick
it
back
in
his
pocket
yesterday
he
was
a
wanderer
too
and
ye
have
to
send
a
keen
one
to
trace
him
i
thinkin
to
find
where
he
got
it
so
ye
can
show
it
in
court
i
going
myself
i
found
out
that
he
came
here
from
denver
and
from
where
before
that
i
do
know
but
i
keep
on
travelling
till
i
get
what
i
want
that
right
my
boy
exclaimed
the
other
heartily
it
may
be
a
long
trip
but
ye
all
the
little
man
has
to
depend
on
did
ye
notice
the
tocsin
did
even
give
him
the
credit
fer
givin
himself
up
yes
said
joe
it
part
of
their
game
did
it
strike
ye
now
sheehan
asked
earnestly
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
did
it
strike
ye
that
the
tocsin
was
aimin
more
to
do
happy
harm
because
of
you
than
himself
yes
joe
looked
sadly
out
of
the
window
i
thought
that
over
and
it
seemed
possible
that
i
might
do
happy
more
good
by
giving
his
case
to
some
other
lawyer
no
sir
exclaimed
the
proprietor
of
beaver
beach
loudly
begun
their
attack
they
bound
to
keep
it
up
and
they
manage
to
turn
it
to
the
discredit
of
both
of
ye
besides
happy
would
have
no
other
lawyer
he
ruther
be
hung
with
you
fightin
fer
him
than
be
cleared
by
anybody
else
i
it
on
my
soul
i
do
but
look
here
he
went
on
leaning
still
farther
forward
i
want
to
know
if
it
struck
ye
that
this
morning
the
tocsin
attacked
ye
in
a
way
that
was
somehow
than
ever
before
yes
replied
joe
because
it
was
aimed
to
strike
where
it
would
most
count
it
ai
only
that
said
the
other
excitedly
it
ai
only
that
i
want
ye
to
listen
now
see
here
the
tocsin
is
pike
and
the
town
is
pike
i
mean
the
town
ye
naturally
belonged
to
ai
it
in
a
way
i
suppose
yes
in
a
way
echoed
the
other
scornfully
ye
know
it
is
even
as
a
boy
pike
disliked
ye
and
hated
the
kind
of
a
boy
ye
was
ye
respectable
and
he
was
ye
was
rich
and
he
was
ye
had
a
grin
on
yer
face
when
ye
meet
him
on
the
street
the
man
broke
off
at
a
gesture
from
joe
and
exclaimed
sharply
do
deny
it
know
what
ye
was
like
ye
was
impudent
but
ye
looked
at
him
as
if
ye
saw
through
him
now
listen
and
i
lead
ye
somewhere
ye
run
with
riffraff
naggers
and
even
sheehan
lifted
a
forefinger
solemnly
and
shook
it
at
his
auditor
and
even
with
the
irish
now
i
ask
ye
this
ye
had
one
part
of
canaan
with
ye
from
the
start
my
part
that
is
but
the
other
against
ye
that
part
pike
and
the
rulin
part
yes
mike
said
joe
wearily
in
the
spirit
of
things
i
know
no
sir
cried
the
other
that
the
trouble
ye
do
know
there
more
in
canaan
than
ye
understood
listen
to
this
why
was
the
tocsin
attack
harder
this
morning
than
ever
before
on
yer
soul
did
it
sound
so
bitter
that
it
sounded
desprit
now
why
it
looked
to
me
as
if
it
had
started
to
ruin
ye
this
time
fer
good
and
all
why
what
have
ye
had
to
do
with
martin
pike
lately
has
the
old
wolf
got
to
injure
ye
sheehan
voice
rose
and
his
eyes
gleamed
under
bushy
brows
think
he
finished
what
happened
lately
to
make
him
bite
so
hard
there
were
some
faded
roses
on
the
desk
and
as
joe
haggard
eyes
fell
upon
them
the
answer
came
what
makes
you
think
judge
pike
trustworthy
he
had
asked
ariel
and
her
reply
had
been
nothing
very
definite
unless
it
was
his
look
when
i
told
him
that
i
meant
to
ask
you
to
take
charge
of
things
for
me
he
got
slowly
and
amazedly
to
his
feet
you
got
it
he
said
ye
see
cried
mike
sheehan
slapping
his
thigh
with
a
big
hand
on
my
soul
i
have
the
penetration
ye
do
need
to
tell
me
one
thing
except
this
i
told
ye
i
lead
ye
somewhere
have
i
kept
me
word
yes
said
joe
but
i
have
the
penetration
exclaimed
sheehan
should
i
miss
my
guess
if
i
said
that
ye
think
pike
may
be
scared
ye
stumble
on
his
track
in
some
queer
performances
should
i
miss
it
no
said
joe
you
would
miss
it
just
one
thing
more
the
man
rose
mopping
the
inner
band
of
his
straw
hat
in
the
matter
of
yer
runnin
fer
mayor
now
joe
who
had
begun
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
made
an
impatient
gesture
pshaw
he
interrupted
but
his
friend
stopped
him
with
a
hand
laid
on
his
arm
do
be
treatin
it
as
clean
out
of
all
possibility
joe
louden
if
ye
do
it
shows
ye
have
sense
to
know
that
nobody
can
say
what
way
the
wind
blowin
week
after
next
all
the
boys
want
ye
louie
farbach

ye
and
louie

big
say
who
is

joe

if
ye
git
the
nomination
be
elected
would
ye
i
could
be
nominated
i
ai
claimin
ye

martin
pike
vote
returned
sheehan
sharply
though
i
do
say
it
impossible
ye
got
to
beat
him
that
all
ye
got
to
do
to
him
what
he
done
to
you
and
what
he
tryin
to
do
now
worse
than
ever
before
well
there
may
be
ways
to
do
it
and
if
he
tempts
me
enough
i
may
fergit
my
troth
and
honor
as
a
noble
gentleman
and
help

with
a
word
ye

yerself
you
hinted
at
such
mysteries
before
mike
joe
smiled
i
be
glad
to
know
what
you
mean
if
there
anything
in
them
it
may
come
to
that
said
the
other
with
some
embarrassment
it
may
come
to
that
some
day
if
the
old
wolf
presses
me
too
hard
in
the
matter
o
tryin
to
git
the
little
man
across
the
street
hanged
by
the
neck
and
yerself
mobbed
fer
helpin
him
but
i
say
no
more
very
well
mike
joe
turned
wearily
to
his
desk
i
do
want
you
to
break
any
promises
sheehan
had
gone
to
the
door
but
he
paused
on
the
threshold
and
wiped
his
forehead
again
and
i
do
want
to
break
any
he
said
but
if
ever
the
time
should
come
when
i
could
help
it
he
lowered
his
voice
to
a
hoarse
but
piercing
whisper
that
will
be
the
devourin
angel
day
fer
martin
pike
xviii
in
the
heat
of
the
day
it
was
a
morning
of
the
warmest
week
of
and
canaan
lay
inert
and
helpless
beneath
a
broiling
sun
the
few
people
who
moved
about
the
streets
went
languidly
keeping
close
to
the
wall
on
the
shady
side
the
women
in
thin
white
fabrics
the
men
often
coatless
carrying
fans
and
replacing
collars
with
handkerchiefs
in
the
yard
the
maple
leaves
gray
with
blown
dust
and
grown
to
great
breadth
drooped
heavily
depressing
the
long
motionless
branches
with
their
weight
so
low
that
the
four
or
five
shabby
idlers
upon
the
benches
beneath
now
and
then
flicked
them
sleepily
with
whittled
sprigs
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
stores
stood
open
displaying
limp
wares
of
trade
but
few
tokens
of
life
the
clerks
hanging
over
dim
counters
as
far
as
possible
from
the
glare
in
front
gossiping
fragmentarily
usually
about
the
cory
murder
and
anon
upon
a
subject
suggested
by
the
sight
of
an
occasional
pedestrian
passing
perspiring
by
with
scrooged
eyelids
and
purpling
skin
from
street
and
sidewalk
transparent
hot
waves
swam
up
and
danced
themselves
into
nothing
while
from
the
river
bank
a
away
came
a
sound
hotter
than
even
the
locust
midsummer
rasp
the
drone
of
a
a
chance
boy
lying
prone
in
the
grass
of
the
yard
was
annoyed
by
the
relentless
chant
and
lifted
his
head
to
mock
it
shut
up
ca
you
the
effort
was
exhausting
he
relapsed
and
suffered
with
increasing
malice
but
in
silence
abruptly
there
was
a
violent
outbreak
on
the
national
house
corner
as
when
a
quiet
farmhouse
is
startled
by
some
one
inadvertently
bringing
down
all
the
tin
from
a
shelf
in
the
pantry
the
loafers
on
the
benches
turned
hopefully
saw
what
it
was
then
closed
their
eyes
and
slumped
back
into
their
former
positions
the
outbreak
subsided
as
suddenly
as
it
had
arisen
colonel
flitcroft
pulled
arp
down
into
his
chair
again
and
it
was
all
over
greater
heat
than
that
of
these
blazing
days
could
not
have
kept
one
of
the
sages
from
attending
the
conclave
now
for
the
battle
was
on
in
canaan
and
here
upon
the
national
house
corner
under
the
shadow
of
the
west
wall
it
waxed
even
keener
perhaps
we
may
find
full
justification
for
calling
what
was
happening
a
battle
in
so
far
as
we
restrict
the
figure
to
apply
to
this
one
spot
else
where
in
the
canaan
of
the
tocsin
the
conflict
was
too
the
tocsin
had
indeed
tried
the
case
of
happy
fear
in
advance
had
convicted
and
condemned
and
every
day
grew
more
bitter
nor
was
the
urgent
vigor
of
its
attack
without
effect
sleepy
as
main
street
seemed
in
the
heat
the
town
was
incensed
and
roused
to
a
tensity
of
feeling
it
had
not
known
since
the
civil
war
when
on
occasion
it
had
set
out
to
hang
half
a
dozen
knights
of
the
golden
circle
joe
had
been
hissed
on
the
street
many
times
since
the
inimical
clerk
had
whistled
at
him
probably
demonstrations
of
that
sort
would
have
continued
had
he
remained
in
canaan
but
for
almost
a
month
he
had
been
absent
and
his
office
closed
its
threshold
gray
with
dust
there
were
people
who
believed
that
he
had
run
away
again
this
time
never
to
return
among
those
who
held
to
this
opinion
being
louden
and
her
sister
upon
only
one
point
was
everybody
agreed
that
twelve
men
could
not
be
found
in
the
county
who
could
be
so
far
persuaded
and
befuddled
by
louden
that
they
would
dare
to
allow
happy
fear
to
escape
the
women
of
canaan
incensed
by
the
terrible
circumstance
of
the
case
as
the
tocsin
colored
it
a
man
shot
down
in
the
act
of
begging
his
enemy
forgiveness
clamored
as
loudly
as
the
men
there
was
only
the
difference
that
the
latter
vociferated
for
the
hanging
of
happy
their
good
ladies
used
the
word
punishment
and
yet
while
the
place
rang
with
condemnation
of
the
little
man
in
the
jail
and
his
attorney
there
were
voices
here
and
there
uplifted
on
the
other
side
people
existed
it
astonishingly
appeared
who
liked
happy
fear
these
were
for
the
greater
part
obscure
and
even
darkling
in
their
lives
yet
quite
demonstrably
human
beings
able
to
smile
suffer
leap
run
and
to
entertain
fancies
even
to
have
according
to
their
degree
a
certain
rudimentary
sense
of
right
and
wrong
in
spite
of
which
they
strongly
favored
the
acquittal
precisely
on
that
account
it
was
argued
an
acquittal
would
outrage
canaan
and
lay
it
open
to
untold
danger
such
people
needed
a
lesson
the
tocsin
interviewed
the
town
great
ones
printing
their
opinions
of
the
heinousness
of
the
crime
and
the
character
of
the
lawyer
the
hon
parrott
who
so
ably
represented
this
county
in
the
legislature
some
fourteen
years
ago
could
scarcely
restrain
himself
when
approached
by
a
reporter
as
to
his
sentiments
anent
the
repulsive
deed
should
like
to
know
how
long
canaan
is
going
to
put
up
with
this
sort
of
business
were
his
words
am
a
citizen
and
i
have
served
faithfully
and
with
my
full
endeavor
and
ability
to
enact
the
laws
and
statutes
of
my
state
but
there
is
a
point
in
my
patience
i
would
state
which
lawbreakers
and
their
lawyers
may
not
safely
pass
of
what
use
are
our
most
solemn
enactments
i
may
even
ask
of
what
use
is
the
legislature
itself
chosen
by
the
will
of
the
people
if
they
are
to
ruthlessly
be
set
aside
by
criminals
and
their
shifty
protectors
the
blame
should
be
put
upon
the
lawyers
who
by
tricks
enable
such
rascals
to
escape
the
rigors
of
the
carefully
enacted
laws
the
fruits
of
the
solon
labor
more
than
upon
the
criminals
themselves
in
this
case
if
there
is
any
miscarriage
of
justice
i
will
say
here
and
now
that
in
my
opinion
the
people
of
this
county
will
be
sorely
tempted
and
while
i
do
not
believe
in
yet
if
that
should
be
the
result
it
is
my
unalterable
conviction
that
the
vigilantes
may
well
turn
their
attention
to
the
lawyers
or
lawyer
who
bring
about
such
miscarriage
i
am
sick
of
it
the
tocsin
did
not
print
the
interview
it
obtained
from
louie
farbach
the
same
louie
farbach
who
long
ago
had
owned
a
with
a
little
room
behind
the
bar
where
a
shabby
boy
sometimes
played
dominoes
and
with
loafers
not
quite
the
same
louie
farbach
however
in
outward
circumstance
for
he
was
now
the
brewer
of
farbach
beer
and
making
canaan
famous
his
rise
had
been
teutonic
and
sure
and
he
contributed
of
his
income
to
the
german
orphan
asylum
and
to
his
party
campaign
fund
the
twentieth
saved
the
orphans
from
the
county
while
the
tithe
gave
the
county
to
his
party
he
occupied
a
kitchen
chair
enjoying
the
society
of
some
chickens
in
a
wired
enclosure
behind
the
new
italian
villa
he
had
erected
in
that
part
of
canaan
where
he
would
be
most
uncomfortable
and
he
looked
woodenly
at
the
reporter
when
the
latter
put
his
question
hef
you
any
aguaintunce
off
mitster
fear
he
inquired
in
return
with
no
expression
decipherable
either
upon
his
gargantuan
face
or
in
his
heavily
enfolded
eyes
no
sir
replied
the
reporter
grinning
i
never
ran
across
him
dot
iss
a
goot
fer
you
said
farbach
stonily
he
iss
not
a
man
peobles
bedder
try
to
run
across
it
iss
what
gory
tried
now
gory
iss
dead
the
reporter
slightly
puzzled
lit
a
cigarette
see
here
farbach
he
urged
i
only
want
a
word
or
two
about
this
thing
and
you
might
give
me
a
brief
expression
concerning
that
man
louden
besides
just
a
hint
of
what
you
think
of
his
influence
here
you
know
and
of
the
kind
of
sharp
work
he
practises
something
like
that
i
see
said
the
brewer
slowly
happy

continued
farbach
turning
again
to
stare
at
his
chickens
git

what
git

repeated
the
other
without
passion
without
anger
without
any
expression
whatsoever
git
owit
the
reporter
prejudice
against
the
german
nation
dated
from
that
moment
there
were
others
here
and
there
who
were
less
than
the
brewer
a
struck
a
fellow
laborer
in
the
for
speaking
ill
of
joe
and
the
unravelling
of
a
strange
street
fight
one
day
disclosed
as
its
cause
a
like
resentment
on
the
part
of
a
blind
engendered
by
a
like
offence
the
companion
reading
the
tocsin
as
the
two
walked
together
had
begun
the
quarrel
by
remarking
that
happy
fear
ought
to
be
hanged
once
for
his
own
sake
and
twice
more
to
show
up
that
shyster
louden
warm
words
followed
leading
to
extremely
material
conflict
in
which
in
spite
of
his
blindness
the
had
so
much
the
best
of
it
that
he
was
removed
from
the
triumphant
attitude
he
had
assumed
toward
the
person
of
his
adversary
which
was
an
admirable
imitation
of
the
dismounted
george
and
the
dragon
and
conveyed
to
the
jail
keenest
investigation
failed
to
reveal
anything
oblique
in
the
man
record
to
the
astonishment
of
canaan
there
was
nothing
against
him
he
was
blind
and
moderately
poor
but
a
respectable
artisan
and
a
pride
to
the
church
in
which
he
was
what
has
been
called
an
active
worker
it
was
discovered
that
his
sensitiveness
to
his
attack
on
joseph
louden
arose
from
the
fact
that
joe
had
obtained
the
acquittal
of
an
imbecile
sister
of
the
blind
man
a
woman
who
had
been
charged
with
bigamy
the
tocsin
made
what
it
could
of
this
and
so
dexterously
that
the
wrath
of
canaan
was
one
farther
jot
increased
against
the
shyster
ay
the
town
was
hot
inside
and
out
let
us
consider
the
forum
was
there
ever
before
such
a
summer
for
the
national
house
corner
how
voices
first
thundered
there
then
cracked
and
piped
is
not
to
be
rendered
in
all
the
tales
of
the
fathers
one
who
would
make
vivid
the
great
doings
must
indeed
dip
his
brush
in
earthquake
and
eclipse
even
then
he
could
but
picture
the
credible
and
must
despair
of
this
the
silence
of
eskew
arp
not
that
eskew
held
his
tongue
not
that
he
was
chary
of
speech
no
o
tempora
o
mores
no
but
that
he
refused
the
subject
in
hand
that
he
eschewed
expression
upon
it
and
resolutely
drove
the
argument
in
other
directions
that
he
achieved
such
superbly
inconsistency
and
with
such
rich
material
for
his
sardonic
humors
not
at
arm
length
not
even
so
far
as
his
but
beneath
his
very
palms
he
rejected
it
this
was
the
impossible
fact
eskew
there
is
no
option
but
to
declare
was
no
longer
eskew
it
is
the
truth
since
the
morning
when
ariel
tabor
came
down
from
office
leaving
her
offering
of
white
roses
in
that
dingy
dusty
shady
place
eskew
had
not
been
himself
his
comrades
observed
it
somewhat
in
a
physical
difference
one
of
those
alterations
which
may
come
upon
men
of
his
years
suddenly
like
a
sea
change
his
face
was
whiter
his
walk
slower
his
voice
filed
thinner
he
creaked
louder
when
he
rose
or
sat
old
always
from
his
boyhood
he
had
in
the
turn
of
a
hand
become
aged
but
such
things
come
and
such
things
go
after
eighty
there
are
ups
and
downs
people
fading
away
one
week
bloom
out
pleasantly
the
next
and
resiliency
is
not
at
all
a
patent
belonging
to
youth
alone
the
material
change
in
arp
might
have
been
thought
little
worth
remarking
what
caused
peter
bradbury
squire
buckalew
and
the
colonel
to
shake
their
heads
secretly
to
one
another
and
wonder
if
their
good
old
friend
mind
had
not
begun
to
go
was
something
very
different
to
come
straight
down
to
it
he
not
only
abstained
from
all
argument
upon
the
cory
murder
and
the
case
of
happy
fear
refusing
to
discuss
either
in
any
terms
or
under
any
circumstances
but
he
also
declined
to
speak
of
ariel
tabor
or
of
joseph
louden
or
of
their
affairs
singular
or
plural
masculine
feminine
or
neuter
or
in
any
declension
not
a
word
committal
or
none
and
his
face
when
he
was
silent
fell
into
sorrowful
and
troubled
lines
at
first
they
merely
marvelled
then
squire
buckalew
dared
to
tempt
him
eskew
faded
eyes
showed
a
blue
gleam
but
he
withstood
speaking
of
babylon
to
the
disparagement
of
chicago
they
sought
to
lead
him
into
what
he
evidently
would
not
employing
many
devices
but
the
old
man
was
wily
and
often
carried
them
far
afield
by
secret
ways
of
his
own
this
hot
morning
he
had
done
that
thing
they
were
close
upon
him
pressing
him
hard
when
he
roused
that
outburst
which
had
stirred
the
idlers
on
the
benches
in
the
yard
squire
buckalew
sidelong
at
the
others
but
squarely
at
eskew
had
volunteered
the
information
that
cory
was
a
reformed
priest
stung
by
the
mystery
of
eskew
silence
the
squire
imagination
had
become
magically
gymnastic
and
if
anything
under
heaven
could
have
lifted
the
veil
this
was
the
thing
arp
reply
may
be
reverenced
i
consider
he
said
deliberately
that
james
blaine
furrin
policy
was
childish
and
what
more
i
never
thought
much
of
him
this
outdefied
ajax
and
every
trace
of
the
matter
in
hand
went
to
the
four
winds
eskew
like
rome
was
saved
by
a
cackle
in
which
he
joined
and
a
few
moments
later
as
the
bench
loafers
saw
was
pulled
down
into
his
seat
by
the
colonel
the
voices
of
the
fathers
fell
to
the
pitch
of
ordinary
discourse
the
drowsy
town
was
quiet
again
the
whine
of
the
boring
its
way
through
the
sizzling
air
to
every
wakening
ear
far
away
on
a
quiet
street
it
sounded
faintly
like
the
hum
of
a
bee
across
a
creek
and
was
drowned
in
the
noise
of
men
at
work
on
the
old
tabor
house
it
seemed
the
only
busy
place
in
canaan
that
day
the
shade
of
the
big
which
surrounded
it
affording
some
shelter
from
the
destroying
sun
to
the
dripping
laborers
who
were
sawing
hammering
painting
plumbing
papering
and
ripping
open
old
and
new
there
were
many
changes
in
the
old
house
pleasantly
in
keeping
with
its
simple
character
airy
enlargements
now
almost
completed
so
that
some
of
the
rooms
were
already
finished
and
stood
furnished
and
immaculate
ready
for
tenancy
in
that
which
had
been
roger
tabor
studio
sat
ariel
alone
she
had
caused
some
chests
and
cases
stored
there
to
be
opened
and
had
taken
out
of
them
a
few
of
roger
canvases
and
set
them
along
the
wall
tears
filled
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
them
seeing
the
tragedy
of
labor
the
old
man
had
expended
upon
them
but
she
felt
the
recompense
hard
tight
literal
as
they
were
he
had
had
his
moment
of
joy
in
each
of
them
before
he
saw
them
coldly
and
knew
the
truth
and
he
had
been
given
his
years
of
paris
at
last
and
had
seen
how
the
other
fellows
did
it
a
heavy
foot
strode
through
the
hall
coming
abruptly
to
a
halt
in
the
doorway
and
turning
she
discovered
martin
pike
his
big
face
flushed
more
with
anger
than
with
the
heat
his
hat
was
upon
his
head
and
remained
there
nor
did
he
offer
any
token
or
word
of
greeting
whatever
but
demanded
to
know
when
the
work
upon
the
house
had
been
begun
the
second
morning
after
my
return
she
answered
i
want
to
know
he
pursued
why
it
was
kept
secret
from
me
and
i
want
to
know
quick
secret
she
echoed
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
to
indicate
the
noise
which
the
workmen
were
making
upon
whose
authority
was
it
begun
mine
who
else
could
give
it
look
here
he
said
advancing
toward
her
do
you
try
to
fool
me
you
have
done
all
this
by
yourself
who
hired
these
workmen
remembering
her
first
interview
with
him
she
rose
quickly
before
he
could
come
near
her
louden
made
most
of
the
arrangements
for
me
she
replied
quietly
before
he
went
away
he
will
take
charge
of
everything
when
he
returns
you
have
forgotten
that
i
told
you
i
intended
to
place
my
affairs
in
his
hands
he
had
started
forward
but
at
this
he
stopped
and
stared
at
her
inarticulately
you
remember
she
said
her
hands
resting
negligently
upon
the
back
of
the
chair
surely
you
remember
she
was
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
him
but
coolly
watchful
of
him
this
had
been
her
habit
with
him
since
her
return
she
had
seen
little
of
him
except
at
table
when
he
was
usually
grimly
laconic
though
now
and
then
she
would
hear
him
joking
heavily
with
sam
warden
in
the
yard
or
with
evidently
humorous
intent
groaning
at
mamie
over
health
but
it
had
not
escaped
ariel
that
he
was
on
his
part
watchful
of
herself
and
upon
his
guard
with
a
wariness
in
which
she
was
sometimes
surprised
to
believe
that
she
saw
an
almost
haggard
apprehension
he
did
not
answer
her
question
and
it
seemed
to
her
as
she
continued
steadily
to
meet
his
hot
eyes
that
he
was
trying
to
hold
himself
under
some
measure
of
control
and
a
vain
effort
it
proved
you
go
back
to
my
house
he
burst
out
shouting
hoarsely
you
get
back
there
you
stay
there
no
she
said
moving
between
him
and
the
door
mamie
and
i
are
going
for
a
drive
you
go
back
to
my
house
he
followed
her
waving
an
arm
fiercely
at
her
do
you
come
around
here
trying
to
run
over
me
you
talk
about
your
all
you
got
on
earth
is
this
old
shack
over
your
head
and
a
of
distillery
stock
that
you
can
sell
by
the
pound
for
old
paper
he
threw
the
words
in
her
face
the
voice
seamed
and
cracked
with
falsetto
old
paper
old
rags
old
iron
bottles
old
clothes
you
talk
about
your
affairs
who
are
you
rothschild
you
have
got
any
affairs
not
a
look
not
a
word
not
a
motion
of
his
escaped
her
in
all
the
fury
of
sound
and
gesture
in
which
he
seemed
fairly
to
envelop
himself
least
of
all
did
that
shaking
of
his
the
quivering
of
jaw
and
temple
the
tumultuous
agitation
of
his
hands
evade
her
watchfulness
when
did
you
find
this
out
she
said
very
quickly
after
you
became
administrator
he
struck
the
back
of
the
chair
she
had
vacated
a
vicious
blow
with
his
open
hand
no
you
spendthrift
all
there
was
to
your
grandfather
when
you
buried
him
was
a
basket
full
of
distillery
stock
i
tell
you
old
paper
ca
you
hear
me
old
paper
old
rags
you
have
sent
me
the
same
income
she
lifted
her
voice
to
interrupt
you
have
made
the
same
quarterly
payments
since
his
death
that
you
made
before
if
you
knew
why
did
you
do
that
he
had
been
shouting
at
her
with
the
frantic
and
incredulous
exasperation
of
an
intolerant
man
utterly
unused
to
opposition
his
face
empurpled
his
forehead
dripping
and
his
hands
ruthlessly
pounding
the
back
of
the
chair
but
this
straight
question
stripped
him
suddenly
of
gesture
and
left
him
standing
limp
and
still
before
her
pale
splotches
beginning
to
show
on
his
hot
cheeks
if
you
knew
why
did
you
do
it
she
repeated
you
wrote
me
that
my
income
was
from
dividends
and
i
knew
and
thought
nothing
about
it
but
if
the
stock
which
came
to
me
was
worthless
how
could
it
pay
dividends
it
did
not
he
answered
huskily
that
distillery
stock
i
tell
you
is
worth
the
matches
to
burn
it
but
there
has
been
no
difference
in
my
income
she
persisted
steadily
why
can
you
explain
that
to
me
yes
i
can
he
replied
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
he
spoke
with
a
pallid
and
bitter
desperation
like
a
man
driven
to
the
wall
i
can
if
you
think
you
want
to
know
i
do
i
sent
it
do
you
mean
from
you
own
i
mean
it
was
my
own
money
she
had
not
taken
her
eyes
from
his
which
met
hers
straightly
and
angrily
and
at
this
she
leaned
forward
gazing
at
him
with
profound
scrutiny
why
did
you
send
it
she
asked
charity
he
answered
after
palpable
hesitation
her
eyes
widened
and
she
leaned
back
against
the
lintel
of
the
door
staring
at
him
incredulously
charity
she
echoed
in
a
whisper
perhaps
he
mistook
her
amazement
at
his
performance
for
dismay
caused
by
the
sense
of
her
own
position
for
as
she
seemed
to
weaken
before
him
the
strength
of
his
own
habit
of
dominance
came
back
to
him
charity
madam
he
broke
out
shouting
intolerably
charity
d
hear
i
was
a
friend
of
the
man
that
made
the
money
you
and
your
grandfather
squandered
i
was
a
friend
of
jonas
tabor
i
say
why
i
was
willing
to
support
you
for
a
year
and
over
rather
than
let
a
niece
of
his
suffer
she
cried
you
sent
me
a
hundred
thousand
francs
the
white
splotches
which
had
mottled
martin
pike
face
disappeared
as
if
they
had
been
suddenly
splashed
with
hot
red
you
go
back
to
my
house
he
said
what
i
sent
you
only
shows
the
extent
of
my
effrontery
the
word
rang
through
the
whole
house
so
loudly
and
clearly
did
she
strike
it
rang
in
his
ears
till
it
stung
like
a
castigation
it
was
ominous
portentous
of
justice
and
of
disaster
there
was
more
than
doubt
of
him
in
it
there
was
conviction
he
fell
back
from
this
word
and
when
he
again
advanced
ariel
had
left
the
house
she
had
turned
the
next
corner
before
he
came
out
of
the
gate
and
as
he
passed
his
own
home
on
his
way
he
saw
her
white
dress
mingling
with
his
daughter
near
the
beside
the
fire
where
the
two
with
their
arms
about
each
other
stood
waiting
for
sam
warden
and
the
open
summer
carriage
judge
pike
walked
on
the
white
splotches
reappearing
like
a
pale
rash
upon
his
face
a
yellow
butterfly
zigzagged
before
him
across
the
sidewalk
he
raised
his
foot
and
half
kicked
at
it
xix
eskew
arp
as
the
judge
continued
his
walk
down
main
street
he
wished
profoundly
that
the
butterfly
which
exhibited
no
annoyance
had
been
of
greater
bulk
and
more
approachable
and
it
was
the
evil
fortune
of
mongrel
to
encounter
him
in
the
sinister
humor
of
such
a
wish
unfulfilled
respectability
dwelt
at
beaver
beach
under
the
care
of
sheehan
until
his
master
should
return
and
sheehan
was
kind
but
the
small
dog
found
the
world
lonely
and
time
long
without
joe
he
had
grown
more
and
more
restless
and
at
last
this
hot
morning
having
managed
to
evade
the
eye
of
all
concerned
in
his
keeping
made
off
unobtrusively
partly
by
swimming
and
reaching
the
road
cantered
into
town
his
ears
erect
with
anxiety
bent
upon
reaching
the
familiar
office
he
passed
the
grocery
from
the
doorway
of
which
the
pimply
cheeked
clerk
had
thrown
a
bad
potato
at
him
a
month
before
the
same
clerk
had
just
laid
down
the
tocsin
as
respectability
went
by
and
inspired
to
great
deeds
in
behalf
of
justice
and
his
native
city
he
rushed
to
the
door
lavishly
seized
this
time
a
perfectly
good
potato
and
hurled
it
with
a
result
which
ecstasized
him
for
it
took
the
mongrel
fairly
aside
the
head
which
it
matched
in
size
the
luckless
respectability
purpose
to
reach
joe
stairway
had
been
entirely
definite
but
upon
this
violence
he
forgot
it
momentarily
it
is
not
easy
to
keep
things
in
mind
when
one
is
violently
smitten
on
mouth
nose
cheek
eye
and
ear
by
a
missile
large
enough
to
strike
them
simultaneously
yelping
and
half
blinded
he
deflected
to
cross
main
street
judge
pike
had
elected
to
cross
in
the
opposite
direction
and
the
two
met
in
the
middle
of
the
street
the
encounter
was
miraculously
fitted
to
the
judge
need
here
was
no
butterfly
but
a
solid
body
light
withal
a
wet
muddy
and
dusty
yellow
dog
eminently
kickable
the
man
was
heavily
built
about
the
legs
and
the
vigor
of
what
he
did
may
have
been
additionally
inspired
by
his
recognition
of
the
mongrel
as
joe
louden
the
impact
of
his
toe
upon
the
little
runner
side
was
momentous
and
the
latter
rose
into
the
air
the
judge
hopped
as
one
hops
who
unshod
in
the
night
discovers
an
unexpected
chair
let
us
be
reconciled
to
his
pain
and
not
reproach
the
gods
with
it
for
two
of
his
unintending
ribs
were
cracked
the
dog
thus
again
deflected
retraced
his
tracks
shrieking
distractedly
and
by
one
of
those
ironical
twists
which
karma
reserves
for
the
tails
of
the
fated
dived
for
blind
safety
into
the
store
commanded
by
the
ecstatic
and
inimical
clerk
there
were
shouts
the
sleepy
square
beginning
to
wake
up
the
boy
who
had
mocked
the
got
to
his
feet
calling
upon
his
fellows
the
bench
loafers
strolled
to
the
street
the
aged
men
stirred
and
rose
from
their
chairs
faces
appeared
in
the
open
windows
of
offices
sales
ladies
and
gentlemen
came
to
the
doorways
of
the
so
that
when
respectability
emerged
from
the
grocery
he
had
a
notable
audience
for
the
scene
he
enacted
with
a
brass
tied
to
his
tail
another
potato
flung
by
the
pimpled
uproarious
prodigal
clerk
added
to
the
impetus
of
his
flight
a
shower
of
pebbles
from
the
hands
of
exhilarated
boys
dented
the
soft
asphalt
about
him
the
hideous
clamor
of
the
pursuing
bell
increased
as
he
turned
the
next
corner
running
distractedly
the
dead
town
had
come
to
life
and
its
inhabitants
gladly
risked
the
dangerous
heat
in
the
interests
of
sport
whereby
it
was
a
merry
chase
the
little
dog
led
around
the
block
for
thus
some
destructive
instinct
drove
him
he
could
not
stop
with
the
unappeasable
terror
clanging
at
his
heels
and
the
increasing
crowd
yelling
in
pursuit
but
he
turned
to
the
left
at
each
corner
and
thus
came
back
to
pass
joe
stairway
again
unable
to
pause
there
or
anywhere
unable
to
do
anything
except
to
continue
his
hapless
flight
poor
meteor
round
the
block
he
went
once
more
and
still
no
chance
at
that
empty
stairway
where
perhaps
he
thought
there
might
be
succor
and
safety
blood
was
upon
his
side
where
martin
pike
boot
had
crashed
foam
and
blood
hung
upon
his
jaws
and
lolling
tongue
he
ran
desperately
keeping
to
the
middle
of
the
street
and
not
howling
set
himself
despairingly
to
outstrip
the
terror
the
mob
disdaining
the
sun
superbly
pursued
as
closely
as
it
could
throwing
bricks
and
rocks
at
him
striking
at
him
with
clubs
and
sticks
happy
fear
playing
right
hand
against
left
in
his
cell
heard
the
uproar
made
out
something
of
what
was
happening
and
though
unaware
that
it
was
a
friend
whose
life
was
sought
discovered
a
similarity
to
his
own
case
and
prayed
to
his
dim
gods
that
the
quarry
might
get
away
mad
dog
they
yelled
mad
dog
and
there
were
some
who
cried
joe
louden
dog
that
being
equally
as
exciting
and
explanatory
three
times
round
and
still
the
little
fugitive
maintained
a
lead
a
policeman
a
big
fellow
had
joined
the
pursuit
he
had
children
at
home
who
might
be
playing
in
the
street
and
the
thought
of
what
might
happen
to
them
if
the
mad
dog
should
head
that
way
resolved
him
to
be
cool
and
steady
he
was
falling
behind
so
he
stopped
on
the
corner
trusting
that
respectability
would
come
round
again
he
was
right
and
the
flying
brownish
thing
streaked
along
main
street
passing
the
beloved
stairway
for
the
fourth
time
the
policeman
lifted
his
revolver
fired
twice
missed
once
but
caught
him
with
the
second
shot
in
a
forepaw
clipping
off
a
fifth
toe
one
of
the
small
claws
that
grow
above
the
foot
and
are
always
in
trouble
this
did
not
stop
him
but
the
policeman
afraid
to
risk
another
shot
because
of
the
crowd
waited
for
him
to
come
again
and
many
others
seeing
the
hopeless
circuit
the
mongrel
followed
did
likewise
armed
with
bricks
and
clubs
among
them
was
the
pimply
clerk
who
had
been
inspired
to
commandeer
a
pitchfork
from
a
hardware
store
when
the
fifth
round
came
respectability
race
was
run
he
turned
into
main
street
at
a
broken
speed
limping
parched
voiceless
flecked
with
blood
and
foam
snapping
feebly
at
the
showering
rocks
but
still
indomitably
a
little
ahead
of
the
hunt
there
was
no
yelp
left
in
him
he
was
too
thoroughly
winded
for
that
but
in
his
brilliant
and
despairing
eyes
shone
the
agony
of
a
cry
louder
than
the
tongue
of
a
dog
could
utter
o
master
o
all
the
god
i
know
where
are
you
in
my
mortal
need
now
indeed
he
had
a
gauntlet
to
run
for
the
street
was
lined
with
those
who
awaited
him
while
the
pursuit
grew
closer
behind
a
number
of
the
hardiest
stood
squarely
in
his
path
and
he
hesitated
for
a
second
which
gave
the
opportunity
for
a
surer
aim
and
many
missiles
struck
him
let
him
have
it
now
officer
said
eugene
bantry
standing
with
judge
pike
at
the
policeman
elbow
there
your
chance
but
before
the
revolver
could
be
discharged
respectability
had
begun
to
run
again
hobbling
on
three
legs
and
dodging
feebly
a
heavy
stone
struck
him
on
the
shoulder
and
he
turned
across
the
street
making
for
the
national
house
corner
where
the
joyful
clerk
brandished
his
pitchfork
going
slowly
he
almost
touched
the
pimply
one
as
he
passed
and
the
clerk
already
rehearsing
in
his
mind
the
honors
which
should
follow
the
brave
stroke
raised
the
tines
above
the
little
dog
head
for
the
coup
de
grace
they
did
not
descend
and
the
daring
youth
failed
of
fame
as
the
laurel
almost
embraced
his
brows
a
hickory
was
thrust
between
his
legs
and
he
expecting
to
strike
received
a
blow
upon
the
temple
sufficient
for
his
present
undoing
and
bedazzlement
he
went
over
backwards
and
the
pitchfork
not
the
thing
to
hold
poised
on
high
when
one
is
knocked
down
fell
with
the
force
he
had
intended
for
respectability
upon
his
own
shin
a
train
had
pulled
into
the
station
and
a
tired
young
man
descending
from
a
sleeper
walked
rapidly
up
the
street
to
learn
the
occasion
of
what
appeared
to
be
a
riot
when
he
was
close
enough
to
understand
its
nature
he
dropped
his
bag
and
came
on
at
top
speed
shouting
loudly
to
the
battered
mongrel
who
tried
with
his
remaining
strength
to
leap
toward
him
through
a
cordon
of
kicking
legs
while
eugene
bantry
again
called
to
the
policeman
to
fire
if
he
does
damn
you
i
kill
him
joe
saw
the
revolver
raised
and
then
eugene
being
in
his
way
he
ran
into
his
stepbrother
with
all
his
force
sending
him
to
earth
and
went
on
literally
over
him
as
he
lay
prone
upon
the
asphalt
that
being
the
shortest
way
to
respectability
the
next
instant
the
mongrel
was
in
his
master
arms
and
weakly
licking
his
hands
but
it
was
eskew
arp
who
had
saved
the
little
dog
for
it
was
his
stick
which
had
tripped
the
clerk
and
his
hand
which
had
struck
him
down
all
his
bodily
strength
had
departed
in
that
effort
but
he
staggered
out
into
the
street
toward
joe
joe
louden
called
the
veteran
in
a
loud
voice
joe
louden
and
suddenly
reeled
the
colonel
and
squire
buckalew
were
making
their
way
toward
him
but
joe
holding
the
dog
to
his
breast
with
one
arm
threw
the
other
about
eskew
it
a
town
it
a
town
the
old
fellow
flung
himself
free
from
the
supporting
arm
it
a
town
you
could
even
trust
a
yellow
dog
to
he
sank
back
upon
joe
shoulder
speechless
an
open
carriage
had
driven
through
the
crowd
the
colored
driver
urged
by
two
ladies
upon
the
back
seat
and
martin
pike
saw
it
stop
by
the
group
in
the
middle
of
the
street
where
joe
stood
the
wounded
dog
held
to
his
breast
by
one
arm
the
old
man
white
and
half
fainting
supported
by
the
other
martin
pike
saw
this
and
more
he
saw
ariel
tabor
and
his
own
daughter
leaning
from
the
carriage
the
arms
of
both
pityingly
extended
to
joe
louden
and
his
two
burdens
while
the
stunned
and
silly
crowd
stood
round
them
staring
clouds
of
dust
settling
down
upon
them
through
the
hot
air
xx
three
are
enlisted
now
in
that
blazing
noon
canaan
looked
upon
a
strange
sight
an
open
carriage
whirling
through
main
street
behind
two
galloping
bays
upon
the
back
seat
a
ghostly
white
old
man
with
closed
eyes
supported
by
two
pale
ladies
his
head
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
taller
while
beside
the
driver
a
young
man
whose
coat
and
hands
were
bloody
worked
over
the
hurts
of
an
injured
dog
sam
warden
whip
sang
across
the
horses
lather
gathered
on
their
flanks
and
ariel
voice
steadily
urged
on
the
pace
quicker
sam
if
you
can
for
there
was
little
breath
left
in
the
body
of
eskew
arp
mamie
almost
as
white
as
the
old
man
was
silent
but
she
had
not
hesitated
in
her
daring
now
that
she
had
been
taught
to
dare
she
had
not
come
to
be
ariel
friend
and
honest
follower
for
nothing
and
it
was
mamie
who
had
cried
to
joe
to
lift
eskew
into
the
carriage
you
must
come
too
she
said
we
will
need
you
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
under
the
eyes
of
canaan
joe
louden
rode
in
judge
pike
carriage
at
the
bidding
of
judge
pike
daughter
toward
ariel
own
house
they
sped
with
the
stricken
octogenarian
for
he
was
alone
in
the
world
and
she
would
not
take
him
to
the
cottage
where
he
had
lived
for
many
years
by
himself
a
bleak
little
house
a
derelict
of
the
early
days
left
stranded
far
down
in
the
town
between
a
and
the
the
workmen
were
beginning
their
dinners
under
the
big
trees
but
as
sam
warden
drew
in
the
lathered
horses
at
the
gate
they
set
down
their
tin
buckets
hastily
and
ran
to
help
joe
lift
the
old
man
out
carefully
they
bore
him
into
the
house
and
laid
him
upon
a
bed
in
one
of
the
finished
rooms
he
did
not
speak
or
move
and
the
workmen
uncovered
their
heads
as
they
went
out
but
joe
knew
that
they
were
mistaken
it
all
right
arp
he
said
as
ariel
knelt
by
the
bed
with
water
and
restoratives
it
all
right
do
you
worry
then
the
veteran
lips
twitched
and
though
his
eyes
remained
closed
joe
saw
that
eskew
understood
for
he
gasped
feebly
no
free
seats
to
louden
sewing
at
an
window
the
sight
of
her
stepson
descending
from
judge
pike
carriage
was
sufficiently
startling
but
when
she
saw
mamie
pike
take
respectability
from
his
master
arms
and
carry
him
tenderly
indoors
while
joe
and
ariel
occupied
themselves
with
arp
the
good
lady
sprang
to
her
feet
as
if
she
had
been
stung
regardlessly
sending
her
and
its
contents
scattering
over
the
floor
and
ran
down
the
stairs
three
steps
at
a
time
at
the
front
door
she
met
her
husband
entering
for
his
dinner
and
she
leaped
at
him
had
he
seen
what
was
it
what
had
happened
louden
rubbed
his
indulging
himself
in
a
pause
which
was
like
to
prove
fatal
to
his
companion
finally
vouchsafing
the
information
that
the
doctor
buggy
was
just
turning
the
corner
eskew
arp
had
suffered
a
stroke
it
was
said
and
in
louden
opinion
was
a
mighty
sick
man
his
spouse
replied
in
no
uncertain
terms
that
she
had
seen
quite
that
much
for
herself
urging
him
to
continue
which
he
did
with
a
deliberation
that
caused
her
to
recall
their
with
a
gust
of
passionate
presently
he
managed
to
interrupt
reminding
her
that
her
windows
commanded
as
comprehensive
a
view
of
the
next
house
as
did
the
front
steps
and
after
a
time
her
housewifely
duty
so
far
prevailed
over
her
indignation
at
the
man
unwholesome
stolidity
that
she
followed
him
down
the
hall
to
preside
over
the
meal
not
however
to
partake
largely
of
it
herself
louden
had
no
information
of
eugene
mishap
nor
had
louden
any
suspicion
that
all
was
not
well
with
the
young
man
and
hearing
him
enter
the
front
door
she
called
to
him
that
his
dinner
was
waiting
eugene
however
made
no
reply
and
went
to
his
own
apartment
without
coming
into
the
a
small
crowd
neighboring
children
servants
and
negroes
had
gathered
about
ariel
gate
and
louden
watched
the
disperse
this
assembly
gather
up
their
tools
and
depart
then
mamie
came
out
of
the
house
and
bowing
sadly
to
three
old
men
who
were
entering
the
gate
as
she
left
it
stepped
into
her
carriage
and
drove
away
the
colonel
flitcroft
squire
buckalew
and
peter
bradbury
glanced
at
the
doctor
buggy
shook
their
heads
at
one
another
and
slowly
went
up
to
the
porch
where
joe
met
them
louden
uttered
a
sharp
exclamation
for
the
colonel
shook
hands
with
her
stepson
perhaps
flitcroft
himself
was
surprised
he
had
offered
his
hand
almost
unconsciously
and
the
greeting
was
embarrassed
and
perfunctory
but
his
two
companions
each
in
turn
gravely
followed
his
lead
and
set
face
flushed
a
little
it
was
the
first
time
in
many
years
that
men
of
their
kind
in
canaan
had
offered
him
this
salutation
he
would
let
me
send
for
you
he
told
them
he
said
he
knew
you
be
here
soon
without
that
and
he
led
the
way
to
bedside
joe
and
the
doctor
had
undressed
the
old
man
and
had
put
him
into
of
roger
tabor
taken
from
an
antique
chest
it
was
soft
and
yellow
and
much
more
like
color
than
the
face
above
it
for
the
white
hair
on
the
pillow
was
not
whiter
than
that
yet
there
was
a
strange
youthfulness
in
the
eyes
of
eskew
an
eerie
inexplicable
luminous
live
look
the
thin
cheeks
seemed
fuller
than
they
had
been
for
years
and
though
the
heavier
lines
of
age
and
sorrow
could
be
seen
they
appeared
to
have
been
half
erased
he
lay
not
in
sunshine
but
in
clear
light
the
windows
were
open
the
curtains
restrained
for
he
had
asked
them
not
to
darken
the
room
the
doctor
was
whispering
in
a
doctor
way
to
ariel
at
the
end
of
the
room
opposite
the
bed
when
the
three
old
fellows
came
in
none
of
them
spoke
immediately
and
though
all
three
cleared
their
throats
with
what
they
meant
for
casual
cheerfulness
to
indicate
that
the
situation
was
not
at
all
extraordinary
or
depressing
it
was
to
be
seen
that
the
colonel
chin
trembled
under
his
mustache
and
his
comrades
showed
similar
small
and
unwilling
signs
of
emotion
eskew
spoke
first
well
boys
he
said
and
smiled
that
seemed
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
others
the
three
white
heads
bent
silently
over
the
fourth
upon
the
pillow
and
ariel
saw
waveringly
for
her
eyes
suddenly
filled
that
the
colonel
laid
his
unsteady
hand
upon
eskew
which
was
outside
the
coverlet
it
it
not
said
the
old
soldier
gently
it
not
on
on
both
sides
is
it
eskew
arp
moved
his
hand
slightly
in
answer
it
ai
paralysis
he
said
they
call
it
and
exhaustion
but
it
more
than
that
it
just
my
time
i
heard
the
call
we
all
been
slidin
on
thin
ice
this
long
time
and
it
broke
under
me
eskew
eskew
remonstrated
peter
bradbury
you
ought
to
talk
you
only
kind
of
overdone
a
little
heat
o
the
day
too
and
peter
interrupted
the
sick
man
with
feeble
asperity
did
you
ever
manage
to
fool
me
in
your
life
no
eskew
well
you
not
doin
it
now
two
tears
suddenly
loosed
themselves
from
squire
buckalew
eyelids
despite
his
hard
endeavor
to
wink
them
away
and
he
turned
from
the
bed
too
late
to
conceal
what
had
happened
there
ai
any
call
to
feel
bad
said
eskew
it
might
have
happened
any
time
in
the
night
maybe
at
my
house
and
all
alone
but
here
airie
tabor
brought
me
to
her
own
home
and
takin
care
of
me
i
could
ask
any
better
way
to
go
could
i
i
do
know
what
we
do
stammered
the
colonel
if
you
you
talk
about
goin
away
from
us
eskew
we
we
could
get
along
well
sir
i
almost
kind
of
glad
to
think
arp
murmured
between
short
struggles
for
breath
that
it
be
quieter
on
the
national
house
corner
a
moment
later
he
called
the
doctor
faintly
and
asked
for
a
restorative
there
he
said
in
a
stronger
voice
and
with
a
gleam
of
satisfaction
in
the
vindication
of
his
belief
that
he
was
dying
i
was
almost
gone
then
know
he
lay
panting
for
a
moment
then
spoke
the
name
of
joe
louden
joe
came
quickly
to
the
bedside
i
want
you
to
shake
hands
with
the
colonel
and
peter
and
buckalew
we
did
answered
the
colonel
infinitely
surprised
and
troubled
we
shook
hands
outside
before
we
came
in
do
it
again
said
eskew
i
want
to
see
you
and
joe
making
shift
to
smile
was
suddenly
blinded
so
that
he
could
not
see
the
wrinkled
hands
extended
to
him
and
was
fain
to
grope
for
them
god
knows
why
we
did
all
take
his
hand
long
ago
said
eskew
arp
i
did
because
i
was
stubborn
i
hated
to
admit
that
the
argument
was
against
me
i
acknowledge
it
now
before
him
and
before
you
and
i
want
the
word
of
it
carried
it
all
right
arp
began
joe
tremulously
you
must
hark
to
me
the
old
man
voice
lifted
higher
if
you
ever
whimpered
or
give
or
broke
out
the
wrong
way
it
would
of
been
different
but
you
never
did
i
watched
you
and
i
know
and
you
just
gone
your
own
way
alone
with
the
town
against
you
because
you
got
a
bad
name
as
a
boy
and
once
we
given
you
that
everything
you
did
or
did
do
we
had
to
give
you
a
blacker
one
now
it
time
some
one
stood
by
you
airie
tabor
do
that
with
all
her
soul
and
body
she
told
me
once
i
thought
a
good
deal
of
you
she
knew
but
i
want
these
three
old
friends
of
mine
to
do
it
too
i
was
boys
with
them
and
they
do
it
i
think
they
even
stood
up
fer
you
against
me
sometimes
but
mostly
fer
the
sake
of
the
argument
i
reckon
but
now
they
must
do
it
when
there
more
to
stand
against
than
just
my
talk
they
saw
it
all
the
meanest
thing
i
ever
knew
i
could
of
stood
it
all
except
that
before
they
could
prevent
him
he
had
struggled
half
upright
in
bed
lifting
a
clinched
fist
at
the
town
beyond
the
windows
but
by
god
when
they
got
so
low
down
they
tried
to
kill
your
dog
he
fell
back
choking
in
joe
arms
and
the
physician
bent
over
him
but
eskew
was
not
gone
and
ariel
upon
the
other
side
of
the
room
could
hear
him
whispering
again
for
the
restorative
she
brought
it
and
when
he
had
taken
it
went
quickly
to
the
side
yard
she
sat
upon
a
workman
bench
under
the
big
trees
hidden
from
the
street
shrubbery
and
breathing
deeply
of
the
shaded
air
began
to
cry
quietly
through
the
windows
came
the
quavering
voice
of
the
old
man
lifted
again
insistent
a
little
querulous
but
determined
responses
sounded
intermittently
from
the
colonel
from
peter
and
from
buckalew
and
now
and
then
a
sorrowful
yet
almost
humorous
protest
from
joe
and
so
she
made
out
that
the
veteran
swore
his
three
comrades
to
friendship
with
joseph
louden
to
lend
him
their
countenance
in
all
matters
to
stand
by
him
in
weal
and
woe
to
speak
only
good
of
him
and
defend
him
in
the
town
of
canaan
thus
did
eskew
arp
on
the
verge
of
parting
this
life
render
justice
the
gate
clicked
and
ariel
saw
eugene
approaching
through
the
shrubbery
one
of
his
hands
was
bandaged
a
thin
strip
of
crossed
his
forehead
from
his
left
eyebrow
to
his
hair
and
his
thin
and
agitated
face
showed
several
light
scratches
i
saw
you
come
out
he
said
i
been
waiting
to
speak
to
you
the
doctor
told
us
to
let
him
have
his
way
in
whatever
he
might
ask
ariel
wiped
her
eyes
i
afraid
that
means
i
did
come
to
talk
about
eskew
arp
interrupted
eugene
i
not
laboring
under
any
anxiety
about
him
you
need
be
afraid
he
too
sour
to
accept
his
conge
so
readily
please
lower
your
voice
she
said
rising
quickly
and
moving
away
from
him
toward
the
house
but
as
he
followed
insisting
sharply
that
he
must
speak
with
her
she
walked
out
of
of
the
windows
and
stopping
turned
toward
him
very
well
she
said
is
it
a
message
from
mamie
at
this
he
faltered
and
hung
fire
have
you
been
to
see
her
she
continued
i
am
anxious
to
know
if
her
goodness
and
bravery
caused
her
any
any
discomfort
at
home
you
may
set
your
mind
at
rest
about
that
returned
eugene
i
was
there
when
the
judge
came
home
to
dinner
i
suppose
you
fear
he
may
have
been
rough
with
her
for
taking
my
into
the
carriage
he
was
not
on
the
contrary
he
spoke
very
quietly
to
her
and
went
on
out
toward
the
stables
but
i
have
come
to
you
to
talk
of
judge
pike
either
no
said
ariel
i
do
care
particularly
to
hear
of
him
but
of
mamie
nor
of
her
either
he
broke
out
i
want
to
talk
of
you
there
was
not
mistaking
him
no
possibility
of
misunderstanding
the
real
passion
that
shook
him
and
her
startled
eyes
betrayed
her
comprehension
yes
i
see
you
understand
he
cried
bitterly
that
because
seen
others
the
same
way
god
help
me
he
went
on
striking
his
forehead
with
his
open
hand
that
young
fool
of
a
bradbury
told
me
you
refused
him
only
yesterday
he
was
proud
of
even
rejection
from
you
and
there
norbert
and
half
a
dozen
others
perhaps
already
since
you
been
here
he
flung
out
his
arms
in
ludicrous
savage
despair
and
here
am
i
ah
yes
she
cut
him
off
it
is
of
yourself
that
you
want
to
speak
after
all
not
of
me
look
here
he
vociferated
are
you
going
to
marry
that
joe
louden
i
want
to
know
whether
you
are
or
not
he
gave
me
this
and
this
he
touched
his
bandaged
hand
and
plastered
forehead
he
ran
into
me
over
me
for
nothing
when
i
was
not
on
my
guard
struck
me
down
stamped
on
me
she
turned
upon
him
cheeks
aflame
eyes
sparkling
and
dry
bantry
she
cried
he
did
a
good
thing
and
now
i
want
you
to
go
home
i
want
you
to
go
home
and
try
if
you
can
discover
anything
in
yourself
that
is
worthy
of
mamie
and
of
what
she
showed
herself
to
be
this
morning
if
you
can
you
will
have
found
something
that
i
could
like
she
went
rapidly
toward
the
house
and
he
was
senseless
enough
to
follow
babbling
what
do
you
think
i
made
of
you
trample
on
me
as
he
did
i
ca
bear
everything
i
tell
you
but
she
lifted
her
hand
with
such
imperious
will
that
he
stopped
short
then
through
the
window
of
the
came
clearly
the
querulous
voice
i
tell
you
it
was
i
heard
him
speak
just
now
out
there
in
the
yard
that
of
joe
what
if
he
is
a
hired
hand
on
the
tocsin
he
better
give
up
his
job
and
quit
than
do
what
done
to
help
make
the
town
think
hard
of
joe
and
what
is
he
why
he
worse
than
cory
when
that
claudine
fear
first
came
here
bantry
was
hangin
around
her
himself
joe
knew
it
and
he
never
tell
but
i
will
i
saw
out
near
beaver
beach
and
she
slapped
his
face
fer
him
it
ought
to
be
told
i
did
know
that
joe
knew
that
eugene
stammered
huskily
it
was
it
was
a
long
time
ago
if
you
understood
joe
she
said
in
a
low
voice
you
would
know
that
before
these
men
leave
this
house
he
will
have
their
promise
never
to
tell
his
eyes
fell
miserably
then
lifted
again
but
in
her
clear
and
unbearable
gaze
there
shone
such
a
flame
of
scorn
as
he
could
not
endure
to
look
upon
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
saw
a
true
light
upon
himself
and
though
the
vision
was
darkling
the
revelation
was
complete
heaven
pity
you
she
whispered
eugene
found
himself
alone
and
stumbled
away
his
glance
not
lifted
he
passed
his
own
home
without
looking
up
and
did
not
see
his
mother
beckoning
frantically
from
a
window
she
ran
to
the
door
and
called
him
he
did
not
hear
her
but
went
on
toward
the
tocsin
office
with
his
head
still
bent
xxi
norbert
waits
for
joe
there
was
meat
for
gossip
a
plenty
in
canaan
that
afternoon
and
evening
there
were
rumors
that
ran
from
kitchen
to
parlor
and
rumors
that
ran
from
parlor
to
kitchen
speculations
that
detained
housewives
in
talk
across
front
gates
wonderings
that
held
cooks
in
converse
over
shadeless
back
fences
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
canards
that
brought
main
street
clerks
running
to
the
shop
doors
to
stare
up
and
down
the
sidewalks
out
of
the
confusion
of
report
the
judicious
were
able
by
evenfall
to
extract
a
fair
history
of
this
day
of
revolution
there
remained
no
doubt
that
joe
louden
was
in
attendance
at
the
of
eskew
arp
and
somehow
it
came
to
be
known
that
colonel
flitcroft
squire
buckalew
and
peter
bradbury
had
shaken
hands
with
joe
and
declared
themselves
his
friends
there
were
those
particularly
among
the
relatives
of
the
hoary
trio
who
expressed
the
opinion
that
the
colonel
and
his
comrades
were
too
old
to
be
responsible
and
a
commission
ought
to
sit
on
them
nevertheless
some
echoes
of
last
argument
to
the
conclave
had
sounded
in
the
town
and
were
not
wholly
without
effect
everywhere
there
was
a
nipping
curiosity
to
learn
how
judge
pike
had
taken
the
strange
performance
of
his
daughter
and
the
eager
were
much
disappointed
when
it
was
truthfully
reported
that
he
had
done
and
said
very
little
he
had
merely
discharged
both
sam
warden
and
wife
from
his
service
the
mild
manner
of
the
dismissal
almost
unnerving
mr
warden
although
he
was
fully
prepared
for
and
the
couple
had
found
immediate
employment
in
the
service
of
ariel
tabor
those
who
humanly
felt
the
judge
behavior
to
be
a
trifle
flat
and
unsensational
were
recompensed
late
in
the
afternoon
when
it
became
known
that
eugene
bantry
had
resigned
his
position
on
the
tocsin
his
reason
for
severing
his
connection
was
dumfounding
he
had
written
a
formal
letter
to
the
judge
and
repeated
the
gist
of
it
to
his
associates
in
the
office
and
acquaintances
upon
the
street
he
declared
that
he
no
longer
sympathized
with
the
attitude
of
the
tocsin
toward
his
and
regretted
that
he
had
previously
assisted
in
emphasizing
the
paper
hostility
to
joe
particularly
in
the
matter
of
the
approaching
murder
trial
this
being
the
case
he
felt
that
his
effectiveness
in
the
service
of
the
paper
had
ceased
and
he
must
in
justice
to
the
owner
resign
well
i
damned
was
the
simple
comment
of
the
elder
louden
when
his
sought
him
out
at
the
factory
and
repeated
this
statement
to
him
so
am
i
i
think
said
eugene
wanly
i
going
now
to
see
mother
but
i
be
gone
before
you
come
home
gone
where
just
away
i
do
know
where
eugene
answered
from
the
door
i
could
live
here
any
longer
i
you
been
drinking
said
louden
inspired
you
better
not
let
mamie
pike
see
you
eugene
laughed
desolately
i
do
mean
to
i
shall
write
to
her
he
said
and
was
gone
before
louden
could
restore
enough
order
out
of
the
chaos
in
his
mind
to
stop
him
thus
louden
long
wait
at
the
window
was
tragically
rewarded
and
she
became
an
unhappy
actor
in
canaan
drama
of
that
day
other
ladies
attended
at
other
windows
or
near
their
front
doors
throughout
the
afternoon
the
families
of
the
three
patriarchs
awaiting
their
return
as
the
time
drew
on
with
something
akin
to
frenzy
flitcroft
a
lady
of
temper
whose
rheumatism
confined
her
to
a
chair
had
her
grandson
wheel
her
out
upon
the
porch
and
as
the
dusk
fell
and
she
finally
saw
her
husband
coming
at
a
laggard
pace
leaning
upon
his
cane
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
she
frankly
told
norbert
that
although
she
had
lived
with
that
man
more
than
years
she
would
never
be
able
to
understand
him
she
repeated
this
with
genuine
symptoms
of
hysteria
when
she
discovered
that
the
colonel
had
not
come
straight
from
the
tabor
house
but
had
stopped
two
hours
at
peter
bradbury
to
talk
it
over
one
item
of
his
recital
while
sufficiently
startling
to
his
wife
had
a
remarkable
effect
upon
his
grandson
this
was
the
information
that
ariel
tabor
fortune
no
longer
existed
what
that
cried
norbert
starting
to
his
feet
what
are
you
talking
about
it
true
said
the
colonel
deliberately
she
told
me
so
herself
eskew
had
dropped
off
into
a
sort
of
doze
more
like
a
stupor
perhaps
and
we
all
went
into
roger
old
studio
except
louden
and
the
doctor
and
while
we
were
there
talkin
one
of
pike
clerks
came
with
a
basket
full
of
tin
boxes
and
packages
of
papers
and
talked
to
miss
tabor
at
the
door
and
went
away
then
old
peter
blundered
out
and
asked
her
what
it
was
and
she
said
it
was
her
estate
almost
everything
she
had
except
the
house
buckalew
tryin
to
make
a
joke
said
he
be
willin
to
swap
his
house
and
lot
for
the
basket
and
she
laughed
and
told
him
she
thought
he
be
sorry
that
all
there
was
to
speak
of
was
a
pile
of
distillery
stock
what
repeated
norbert
incredulously
yes
it
was
the
truth
said
the
colonel
solemnly
i
saw
it
myself
blocks
and
blocks
of
stock
in
that
distillery
trust
that
went
up
a
kite
last
year
roger
had
put
all
of
jonas
good
money
not
into
that
shouted
norbert
uncontrollably
excited
yes
he
did
i
tell
you
i
saw
it
i
tell
you
he
did
he
owned
granger
gas
worth
more
than
it
ever
was
pike
was
roger
and
bought
it
for
him
before
the
old
man
died
the
check
went
through
my
hands
you
think
i
forget
as
big
a
check
as
that
do
you
even
if
it
was
more
than
a
year
ago
or
how
it
was
signed
and
who
made
out
to
it
was
martin
pike
that
got
caught
with
distillery
stock
he
speculated
once
too
often
no
you
wrong
persisted
the
colonel
i
tell
you
i
saw
it
myself
then
you
blind
returned
his
grandson
disrespectfully
blind
or
else
or
else
he
paused
a
look
of
wonder
struggling
its
way
to
expression
upon
him
gradually
conquering
every
knobby
outpost
of
his
countenance
he
struck
his
fat
hands
together
where
joe
louden
he
asked
sharply
i
want
to
see
him
did
you
leave
him
at
miss
tabor
he
goin
to
sit
up
with
eskew
what
do
you
want
of
him
i
should
say
you
better
ask
that
flitcroft
began
shrilly
it
enough
i
guess
for
one
of
this
family
to
go
runnin
after
him
and
shakin
hands
with
him
and
heaven
knows
what
not
norbert
flitcroft
but
norbert
jumped
from
the
porch
ruthlessly
crossed
his
and
making
off
at
as
sharp
a
pace
as
his
architecture
permitted
within
ten
minutes
opened
ariel
gate
sam
warden
came
forward
to
meet
him
do
ring
please
suh
said
sam
dey
sot
me
out
heah
to
tell
inquirin
frien
dat
po
ole
mist
arp
mighty
low
i
want
to
see
louden
returned
norbert
i
want
to
see
him
immediately
i
don
reckon
he
kin
come
out
yit
sam
said
in
a
low
tone
but
i
kin
go
in
an
ast
he
stepped
softly
within
leaving
norbert
waiting
and
went
to
the
door
of
the
the
door
was
open
the
room
brightly
lighted
as
eskew
had
commanded
when
a
little
earlier
he
awoke
joe
and
ariel
were
alone
with
him
leaning
toward
him
with
such
white
anxiety
that
the
colored
man
needed
no
warning
to
make
him
remain
silent
in
the
hallway
the
veteran
was
speaking
and
his
voice
was
very
weak
seeming
to
come
from
a
great
distance
it
mighty
funny
but
i
feel
like
i
used
to
when
i
was
a
little
boy
i
reckon
i
kind
of
scared
after
all
airie
tabor
are
you
here
yes
mr
arp
i
thought
so
but
i
i
do
see
very
well
lately
i
wanted
to
know
to
know
yes
to
know
she
knelt
close
beside
him
it
kind
of
foolish
he
whispered
i
just
wanted
to
know
if
you
was
still
here
it
do
seem
so
lonesome
now
that
i
know
she
put
her
arm
lightly
about
him
and
he
smiled
and
was
silent
for
a
time
then
he
struggled
to
rise
upon
his
elbow
and
they
lifted
him
a
little
it
hard
to
breathe
gasped
the
old
man
i
pretty
near
the
big
road
joe
louden
yes
you
have
been
willing
willing
to
change
places
with
me
just
now
when
airie
joe
laid
his
hand
on
his
and
eskew
smiled
again
i
thought
so
and
joe
yes
you
always
always
had
the
the
best
of
that
joke
between
us
do
you
you
suppose
they
charge
admission
up
there
his
eyes
were
lifted
do
you
suppose
you
got
to
to
show
your
good
deeds
to
git
in
the
answering
whisper
was
almost
as
faint
as
the
old
man
no
panted
eskew
nobody
knows
but
i
hope
i
do
hope
they
have
some
free
seats
it
a
mighty
poor
show
we
all
have
if
they
do
he
sighed
peacefully
his
head
grew
heavier
on
joe
arm
and
the
young
man
set
his
hand
gently
upon
the
unseeing
eyes
ariel
did
not
rise
from
where
she
knelt
but
looked
up
at
him
when
a
little
later
he
lifted
his
hand
yes
said
joe
you
can
cry
now
xxii
sheehan
speaks
joe
helped
to
carry
what
was
mortal
of
eskew
from
ariel
house
to
its
final
with
him
in
that
task
were
buckalew
bradbury
the
colonel
and
the
grandsons
of
the
two
latter
and
louden
drew
in
her
skirts
grimly
as
her
passed
her
in
the
mournful
procession
through
the
hall
her
eyes
were
red
with
weeping
not
for
eskew
but
not
so
red
as
those
of
mamie
pike
who
stood
beside
her
on
the
way
to
the
cemetery
joe
and
ariel
were
together
in
a
carriage
with
buckalew
and
the
minister
who
had
read
the
service
a
dark
young
man
and
the
squire
after
being
almost
overcome
during
the
ceremony
experienced
a
natural
reaction
talking
cheerfully
throughout
the
long
drive
he
recounted
many
anecdotes
of
eskew
chuckling
over
most
of
them
though
filled
with
wonder
by
a
coincidence
which
he
and
flitcroft
had
discovered
the
colonel
had
recently
been
made
the
custodian
of
his
old
friend
will
and
it
had
been
opened
the
day
before
the
funeral
eskew
had
left
everything
he
possessed
with
the
regret
that
it
was
so
little
to
joe
but
the
queer
thing
about
it
said
the
squire
addressing
himself
to
ariel
was
the
date
of
it
the
seventeenth
of
june
the
colonel
and
i
got
to
talkin
it
over
out
on
his
porch
last
night
tryin
to
what
was
goin
on
about
then
and
we
figgered
it
out
that
it
was
the
monday
after
you
come
back
the
very
day
he
got
so
upset
when
he
saw
you
goin
up
to
louden
with
your
roses
joe
looked
quickly
at
ariel
she
did
not
meet
his
glance
but
turning
instead
to
ladew
the
clergyman
began
with
a
barely
perceptible
blush
to
talk
of
something
he
had
said
in
a
sermon
two
weeks
ago
the
two
fell
into
a
thoughtful
and
amiable
discussion
during
which
there
stole
into
joe
heart
a
strange
and
unreasonable
pain
the
young
minister
had
lived
in
canaan
only
a
few
months
and
joe
had
never
seen
him
until
that
morning
but
he
liked
the
short
honest
talk
he
had
made
liked
his
cadenceless
voice
and
keen
dark
face
and
recalling
what
he
had
heard
martin
pike
vociferating
in
his
brougham
one
sunday
perceived
that
ladew
was
the
fellow
who
had
got
to
go
because
his
sermons
did
not
please
the
judge
yet
ariel
remembered
for
more
than
a
fortnight
a
passage
from
one
of
these
sermons
and
as
joe
looked
at
the
manly
and
intelligent
face
opposite
him
it
did
not
seem
strange
that
she
should
he
resolutely
turned
his
eyes
to
the
open
window
and
saw
that
they
had
entered
the
cemetery
were
near
the
green
knoll
where
eskew
was
to
lie
beside
a
brother
who
had
died
long
ago
he
let
the
minister
help
ariel
out
going
quickly
forward
himself
with
buckalew
and
then
after
the
little
while
that
the
restoration
of
dust
to
dust
mercifully
needs
he
returned
to
the
carriage
only
to
get
his
hat
ariel
and
ladew
and
the
squire
were
already
seated
and
waiting
are
you
going
to
ride
home
with
us
she
asked
surprised
no
he
explained
not
looking
at
her
i
have
to
talk
with
norbert
flitcroft
i
going
back
with
him
his
excuse
was
the
mere
truth
his
conversation
with
norbert
in
the
carriage
which
they
managed
to
secure
to
themselves
continuing
earnestly
until
joe
spoke
to
the
driver
and
alighted
at
a
corner
near
farbach
italian
possessions
do
forget
he
said
as
he
closed
the
carriage
door
i
got
to
have
both
ends
of
the
string
in
my
hands
forget
norbert
looked
at
the
cupola
of
the
pike
mansion
rising
above
the
maples
down
the
street
it
is
likely
i
forget
when
joe
entered
the
louis
quinze
room
which
some
decorator
drunk
with
power
had
mingled
into
the
brewer
villa
he
found
the
owner
and
sheehan
with
five
other
men
engaged
in
a
meritorious
attempt
to
tone
down
the
apartment
with
smoke
two
of
the
five
others
were
prosperous
owners
of
saloons
two
were
known
to
the
public
whose
notion
of
what
it
meant
when
it
used
the
term
was
something
of
the
vaguest
as
politicians
the
fifth
was
farbach
closest
friend
one
who
joe
had
heard
was
to
be
the
next
chairman
of
the
city
committee
of
the
party
they
were
seated
about
a
table
enveloped
in
blue
clouds
and
hushed
to
a
grave
and
pertinent
silence
which
clarified
immediately
the
circumstance
that
whatever
debate
had
preceded
his
arrival
it
was
now
settled
their
greeting
of
him
however
though
exceedingly
quiet
indicated
a
certain
expectancy
as
he
accepted
the
chair
which
had
been
left
for
him
at
the
head
of
the
table
he
looked
thinner
and
paler
than
usual
which
is
saying
a
great
deal
but
presently
finding
that
the
fateful
hush
which
his
entrance
had
broken
was
immediately
resumed
a
twinkle
came
into
his
eye
one
of
his
eyebrows
went
up
and
a
corner
of
his
mouth
went
down
well
gentlemen
he
said
the
smokers
continued
to
smoke
and
to
do
nothing
else
the
exception
being
sheehan
who
though
he
spoke
not
exhibited
tokens
of
agitation
and
excitement
which
he
curbed
with
difficulty
shifting
about
in
his
chair
gnawing
his
cigar
crossing
and
uncrossing
his
knees
rubbing
and
slapping
his
hands
together
clearing
his
throat
with
violence
his
eyes
fixed
all
the
while
as
were
those
of
his
companions
upon
farbach
so
that
joe
was
given
to
perceive
that
it
had
been
agreed
that
the
brewer
should
be
the
spokesman
farbach
was
deliberate
that
was
all
which
added
to
the
effect
of
what
he
finally
did
say
choe
he
remarked
placidly
you
are
der
next
mayor
off
canaan
why
do
you
say
that
asked
the
young
man
sharply
bickoss
us

he
answered
interlocking
the
tips
of
his
fingers
over
his
waistcoat
that
being
as
near
folding
his
hands
as
lay
within
his
power
bickoss

said
hurriedly

hesitated
stammering

many
of

farbach
returned
peacefully
dot
does
der
fightin
and
you
have
considered
my
standing
with
that
part
of
canaan
which
considers
itself
the
most
respectable
section
he
rose
to
his
feet
standing
straight
and
quiet
facing
the
table
upon
which
it
chanced
there
lay
a
copy
of
the
tocsin
und
yet
observed
farbach
with
mildness
we
got
some
pooty
risbecdable
men
right
here
except
me
broke
in
sheehan
grimly
you
have
have
you
thought
of
this
joe
leaned
forward
and
touched
the
paper
upon
the
table
we
hef
replied
farbach
all
of
us
you
shall
beat
it
there
was
a
strong
chorus
of
confirmation
from
the
others
and
eyes
flashed
have
you
considered
he
continued
rapidly
while
a
warm
color
began
to
conquer
his
pallor
have
you
considered
the
powerful
influence
which
will
be
against
me
and
more
against
me
now
i
should
tell
you
than
ever
before
that
influence
i
mean
which
is
striving
so
hard
to
discredit
me
that
has
been
hinted
for
poor
fear
if
i
should
clear
him
have
you
thought
of
that
have
you
thought
have
we
thought
o
martin

exclaimed
sheehan
springing
to
his
feet
face
aflame
and
beard
bristling
ay
we
thought
martin

and
our
thinkin
of
him
is
where
he
begins
to
git
comin
to
him
what
d
stand
there
pickin
straws
fer
what
the
matter
with
ye
he
demanded
angrily
his
violence
tenfold
increased
by
the
long
repression
he
had
put
upon
himself
during
the
deliberate
utterances
if
louie
farbach
and
his
crowd
says
they
fer
ye
i
guess
ye
got
a
chanst
have

joe
i
think
you
underestimate

underestimate
the
devil
shouted
sheehan
uncontrollably
excited
you
talk
about
influence
he
been
the
worst
influence
this
ever
had
and
his
tracks
covered
up
in
the
dark
wherever
he
set
his
ugly
foot
down
these
men
know
it
and
you
know
some
but
not
the
worst
of
it
because
none
of
ye
live
as
deep
down
in
it
as
i
do
ye
want
to
make
a
clean
town
of
it
ye
want
to
make
a
little
heaven
of
the
beach
and
in
the
eyes
of
judge
pike
joe
cut
him
off
and
of
all
who
take
their
opinions
from
him
i
represent

gave
a
wild
shout

shouted
again
with
bitter
laughter

joe
answered
sharply
if
they
could
wipe
the
beach
off
the
map
and
me
with
it
martin
pike
would
shouted
sheehan
while
the
others
stared
at
him
martin

would
i
do

to
tell
you
that
said
joe
sheehan
big
fist
rose
high
over
the
table
and
descended
crashing
upon
it
it
a
damn
lie
he
roared

xxiii
joe
walks
across
the
yard
from
within
the
glossy
old
walnut
bar
that
ran
from
wall
to
wall
the
eyes
of
the
lawyers
and
reporters
wandered
often
to
ariel
as
she
sat
in
the
packed
watching
louden
fight
for
the
life
and
liberty
of
happy
fear
she
had
always
three
escorts
and
though
she
did
not
miss
a
session
and
the
same
three
never
failed
to
attend
her
no
whisper
of
scandal
arose
but
not
upon
them
did
the
glances
of
the
members
of
the
bar
and
the
journalists
with
tender
frequency
linger
nor
were
the
younger
members
of
these
two
professions
all
who
gazed
that
way
joe
had
fought
out
the
selection
of
the
jury
with
the
prosecutor
at
great
length
and
with
infinite
pains
it
was
not
a
young
jury
and
it
stared
at
her
the
court
wore
a
gray
beard
with
which
a
flock
of
sparrows
might
have
villaged
a
grove
and
yet
in
spite
of
the
vital
necessity
for
watchfulness
over
this
fighting
case
it
once
needed
to
be
stirred
from
a
trancelike
gaze
in
miss
tabor
direction
and
aroused
to
the
realization
that
it
was
there
to
sit
and
not
to
dream
the
august
air
was
warm
outside
the
windows
inviting
to
the
open
country
to
to
orchard
reveries
or
shaded
pool
wherein
to
drop
a
meditative
line
you
would
have
thought
no
one
could
willingly
coop
himself
in
this
hot
room
for
three
hours
twice
a
day
while
lawyers
wrangled
often
unintelligibly
over
the
life
of
a
dingy
little
creature
like
happy
fear
yet
the
struggle
to
swelter
there
was
almost
like
a
riot
and
the
bailiffs
were
busy
men
it
was
a
fighting
case
throughout
fought
to
a
finish
on
each
tiny
point
as
it
came
up
dragging
in
the
mere
matter
of
time
interminably
yet
the
people
of
canaan
not
only
those
who
succeeded
in
penetrating
to
the
but
the
others
who
hung
about
the
corridors
or
outside
the
building
and
the
great
mass
of
who
read
the
story
in
the
tocsin
found
each
moment
of
it
enthralling
enough
the
state
attorney
fearful
of
losing
so
notorious
a
case
and
not
underestimating
his
opponent
had
modestly
summoned
others
to
his
aid
and
the
attorney
for
the
defence
faced
an
array
of
legal
talent
such
as
seldom
indeed
had
hollered
at
this
bar
faced
it
an
eyebrow
crooked
up
and
his
head
on
one
side
most
of
the
time
yet
faced
it
indomitably
he
had
a
certain
careless
and
disarming
smile
when
he
lost
a
point
which
carried
off
the
defeat
as
of
only
humorous
account
and
not
at
all
part
of
the
serious
business
in
hand
and
in
his
treatment
of
witnesses
he
was
plausible
kindly
knowing
that
in
this
case
he
had
no
intending
perjurer
to
entrap
brought
into
play
the
rare
and
delicate
art
of
which
he
was
a
master
employing
in
his
questions
subtle
suggestions
and
shadings
of
tone
and
manner
and
avoiding
words
of
debatable
and
dangerous
meanings
a
fine
craft
often
attempted
by
blunderers
to
their
own
undoing
but
which
practised
by
joseph
louden
made
inarticulate
witnesses
articulate
to
the
precise
effects
which
he
desired
this
he
accomplished
as
much
by
the
help
of
the
continuous
fire
of
objections
from
the
other
side
as
in
spite
of
them
he
was
infinitely
careful
asking
never
an
question
for
the
other
side
to
use
to
his
hurt
and
though
exhibiting
only
a
pleasant
easiness
of
manner
was
electrically
alert
a
hundred
things
had
shown
ariel
that
the
feeling
of
the
place
influenced
by
public
sentiment
without
was
subtly
and
profoundly
hostile
to
joe
and
his
client
she
read
this
in
the
spectators
in
the
jury
even
in
the
judge
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
day
by
day
the
inimical
spirit
gradually
failed
inside
the
railing
and
also
in
those
spectators
who
like
herself
were
enabled
by
special
favor
to
be
present
throughout
the
trial
and
that
now
and
then
a
kindlier
sentiment
began
to
be
manifested
she
was
unaware
how
strongly
she
contributed
to
effect
this
herself
not
only
through
the
glow
of
visible
sympathy
which
radiated
from
her
but
by
a
particular
action
claudine
was
called
by
the
state
and
told
as
much
of
her
story
as
the
law
permitted
her
to
tell
interlarding
her
replies
with
fervent
protestations
too
quick
to
be
prevented
that
she
never
meant
to
bring
no
trouble
to
mr
fear
and
that
she
did
hate
to
have
starting
things
on
her
account
when
the
defence
took
this
perturbed
witness
her
interpolations
became
less
frequent
and
she
described
straightforwardly
how
she
had
found
the
pistol
on
the
floor
near
the
prostrate
figure
of
cory
and
hidden
it
in
her
own
dress
the
attorneys
for
the
state
listened
with
a
somewhat
cynical
amusement
to
this
portion
of
her
testimony
believing
it
of
no
account
uncorroborated
and
that
if
necessary
the
state
could
impeach
the
witness
on
the
ground
that
it
had
been
indispensable
to
produce
her
she
came
down
weeping
from
the
stand
and
the
next
witness
not
being
immediately
called
the
eyes
of
the
jurymen
naturally
followed
her
as
she
passed
to
her
seat
and
they
saw
ariel
tabor
bow
gravely
to
her
across
the
railing
now
a
thousand
things
not
set
forth
by
legislatures
and
judges
affect
a
jury
and
the
slight
salutation
caused
the
members
of
this
one
to
glance
at
one
another
for
it
seemed
to
imply
that
the
exquisite
lady
in
white
not
only
knew
claudine
but
knew
that
she
had
spoken
the
truth
it
was
after
this
that
a
feeling
favorable
to
the
defence
now
and
then
noticeably
manifested
itself
in
the
courtroom
still
when
the
evidence
for
the
state
was
all
in
the
life
of
happy
fear
seemed
to
rest
in
a
balance
precarious
indeed
and
the
little
man
swallowing
pitifully
looked
at
his
attorney
with
the
eyes
of
a
sick
dog
then
joe
gave
the
prosecutors
an
illuminating
and
stunning
surprise
and
having
offered
in
evidence
the
revolver
found
upon
claudine
produced
as
his
first
witness
a
pawnbroker
of
denver
who
identified
the
weapon
as
one
he
had
sold
to
cory
whom
he
had
known
very
well
the
second
witness
also
a
stranger
had
been
even
more
intimately
acquainted
with
the
dead
man
and
there
began
to
be
an
uneasy
comprehension
of
what
joe
had
accomplished
during
that
prolonged
absence
of
his
which
had
so
nearly
cost
the
life
of
the
little
mongrel
who
was
at
present
most
blissful
respectability
a
lively
convalescent
in
ariel
back
yard
the
second
witness
also
identified
the
revolver
testifying
that
he
had
borrowed
it
from
cory
in
louis
to
settle
a
question
of
marksmanship
and
that
on
his
returning
it
to
the
owner
the
latter
then
working
his
way
eastward
had
confided
to
him
his
intention
of
stopping
in
canaan
for
the
purpose
of
exercising
its
melancholy
functions
upon
a
man
who
had
once
done
him
good
in
that
city
by
the
time
the
witness
had
reached
this
point
the
prosecutor
and
his
assistants
were
on
their
feet
excitedly
shouting
objections
which
were
promptly
overruled
taken
unawares
they
fought
for
time
thunder
was
loosed
forensic
bellowings
everybody
lost
his
temper
except
joe
and
the
examination
of
the
witness
proceeded
cory
with
that
singular
inspiration
to
confide
in
some
one
which
is
the
characteristic
and
the
undoing
of
his
kind
had
outlined
his
plan
of
operations
to
the
witness
with
perfect
clarity
he
would
first
attempt
so
he
had
declared
to
incite
an
attack
upon
himself
by
playing
upon
the
jealousy
of
his
victim
having
already
made
a
tentative
effort
in
that
direction
failing
in
this
he
would
fall
back
upon
one
of
a
dozen
schemes
for
he
was
ready
in
such
matters
he
bragged
the
most
likely
of
which
would
be
to
play
the
peacemaker
he
would
talk
of
his
good
intentions
toward
his
enemy
speaking
publicly
of
him
in
friendly
and
gentle
ways
then
getting
at
him
secretly
destroy
him
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
leave
open
for
himself
the
kind
gate
of
in
brief
here
was
the
whole
tally
of
what
had
actually
occurred
with
the
exception
of
the
last
account
in
the
sequence
which
had
proved
that
demise
for
which
cory
had
not
arranged
and
it
fell
from
the
lips
of
a
witness
whom
the
prosecution
had
no
means
of
impeaching
when
he
left
the
stand
unshaken
and
undiscredited
after
a
frantic
joe
turning
to
resume
his
seat
let
his
hand
fall
lightly
for
a
second
upon
his
client
shoulder
that
was
the
occasion
of
a
demonstration
which
indicated
a
sentiment
favorable
to
the
defence
on
the
part
of
at
least
three
of
the
spectators
and
it
was
in
the
nature
of
such
a
hammering
of
canes
upon
the
bare
wooden
floor
as
effectually
stopped
all
other
proceedings
instantly
the
indignant
judge
fixed
the
colonel
peter
bradbury
and
squire
buckalew
with
his
glittering
eye
yet
the
hammering
continued
unabated
and
the
offenders
surely
would
have
been
conducted
forth
in
ignominy
had
not
gallantry
prevailed
even
in
that
formal
place
the
judge
reluctantly
realizing
that
some
latitude
must
be
allowed
to
these
aged
enthusiasts
since
they
somehow
seemed
to
belong
to
miss
tabor
made
his
remarks
general
with
the
threat
to
clear
the
room
whereupon
the
loyal
survivors
of
eskew
relapsed
into
unabashed
silence
it
was
now
as
joe
had
said
a
case
only
the
case
itself
however
was
clear
for
as
he
and
his
friends
feared
the
verdict
might
possibly
be
neither
in
accordance
with
the
law
the
facts
nor
the
convictions
of
the
jury
eugene
defection
had
not
altered
the
tone
of
the
tocsin
all
day
long
a
crowd
of
men
and
boys
hung
about
the
corridors
of
the
about
the
square
and
the
neighboring
streets
and
from
these
rose
sombre
murmurs
more
and
more
ominous
the
public
sentiment
of
a
community
like
canaan
can
make
itself
felt
inside
a
and
it
was
strongly
exerted
against
happy
fear
the
tocsin
had
always
been
a
powerful
agent
judge
pike
had
increased
its
strength
with
a
staff
which
was
thoroughly
efficient
alert
and
always
able
to
strike
centre
with
the
paper
readers
and
in
town
and
country
it
had
absorbed
the
circulation
of
the
other
local
journals
which
resisted
feebly
at
times
but
in
the
matter
of
the
cory
murder
had
not
dared
to
do
anything
except
follow
the
tocsin
lead
the
tocsin
having
lit
the
fire
fed
it
fed
it
saltpetre
and
sulphur
for
now
martin
pike
was
fighting
hard
the
farmers
and
people
of
the
less
urban
parts
of
the
country
were
accustomed
to
found
their
opinions
upon
the
tocsin
they
regarded
it
as
the
single
immutable
rock
of
journalistic
righteousness
and
wisdom
in
the
world
consequently
stirred
by
the
outbursts
of
the
paper
they
came
into
canaan
in
great
numbers
and
though
the
pressure
from
the
town
itself
was
so
strong
that
only
a
few
of
them
managed
to
crowd
into
the
the
others
joined
their
voices
to
those
sombre
murmurs
outdoors
which
increased
in
loudness
as
the
trial
went
on
the
tocsin
however
was
not
having
everything
its
own
way
the
volume
of
outcry
against
happy
fear
and
his
lawyer
had
diminished
it
was
noticed
in
very
respectable
quarters
the
information
imparted
by
mike
sheehan
to
the
politicians
at
farbach
had
been
slowly
seeping
through
the
various
social
strata
of
the
town
and
though
at
first
incredulously
rejected
it
began
to
find
acceptance
upper
main
street
cooling
appreciably
in
its
acceptance
of
the
tocsin
as
the
law
and
the
prophets
there
were
even
a
few
who
dared
to
wonder
in
their
hearts
if
there
had
not
been
a
mistake
about
joe
louden
and
although
flitcroft
weakened
not
the
relatives
of
squire
buckalew
and
of
peter
bradbury
began
to
hold
up
their
heads
a
little
after
having
made
home
horrible
for
those
gentlemen
and
reproached
them
with
their
conversion
as
the
last
word
of
senile
shame
in
addition
the
colonel
grandson
and
bradbury
grandson
had
both
mystifyingly
lent
countenance
to
joe
consorting
with
him
openly
the
former
for
his
own
purposes
the
latter
because
he
had
cunningly
discovered
that
it
was
a
way
to
miss
tabor
regard
which
since
her
gentle
rejection
of
him
he
had
grown
to
believe
good
youth
might
be
the
pleasantest
thing
that
could
ever
come
to
him
in
short
the
question
had
begun
to
thrive
was
it
possible
that
eskew
arp
had
not
been
insane
after
all
the
best
of
those
who
gathered
ominously
about

limped

would
limp
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
who
of
all
men
held
the
memory
of

in
least
respect
and
was
burningly
desirous
to
revenge
himself

when

through

it
furnishes
not

but
the
mass
of

and
it
springs
up
at
times
of
crisis
from
heaven

where
you
might
have
driven
through
all
the
streets
of
canaan
a
week
before
the
trial
and
have
seen
four
or
five
such
fellows
but
from
the
day
of
its
beginning
the
square
was
full
of
them
dingy
shuttlecocks
batted
up
into
view
by
the
tocsin
they
kept
the
air
whirring
with
their
noise
the
news
of
that
sitting
which
had
caused
the
squire
flitcroft
and
peter
bradbury
to
risk
the
court
displeasure
was
greeted
outside
with
loud
and
vehement
disfavor
and
when
at
noon
the
jurymen
were
marshalled
out
to
cross
the
yard
to
the
national
house
for
dinner
a
large
crowd
followed
and
surrounded
them
until
they
reached
the
doors
of
the
hotel
do
let
lawyer
louden
bamboozle
you
hang
him
tar
and
feathers
fer
ye
ef
ye
do
hang
him
these
were
the
mildest
threats
and
joe
louden
watching
from
an
upper
window
of
the
observed
with
a
troubled
eye
how
certain
of
the
jury
shrank
from
the
pressure
of
the
throng
how
the
cheeks
of
others
showed
sudden
pallor
sometimes
public
sentiment
has
done
evil
things
to
those
who
have
not
shared
it
and
joe
knew
how
rare
a
thing
is
a
jury
which
dares
to
stand
square
against
a
town
like
canaan
aroused
the
end
of
that
afternoon
session
saw
another
point
marked
for
the
defence
joe
had
put
the
defendant
on
the
stand
and
the
little
man
had
proved
an
excellent
witness
during
his
life
he
had
been
many
things
many
things
disreputable
high
standards
were
not
brightly
illumined
for
him
in
the
beginning
of
the
which
his
life
had
been
he
had
been
a
tramp
afterward
a
petty
gambler
but
his
great
motive
had
finally
come
to
be
the
intention
to
do
what
joe
told
him
to
do
that
and
to
keep
claudine
as
straight
as
he
could
in
a
measure
these
were
the
two
things
that
had
brought
him
to
the
pass
in
which
he
now
stood
his
loyalty
to
joe
and
his
resentment
of
whatever
tampered
with
claudine
straightness
he
was
submissive
to
the
consequences
he
was
still
loyal
and
now
joe
asked
him
to
tell
just
what
happened
and
happy
obeyed
with
crystal
clearness
throughout
the
long
tricky
he
continued
to
tell
just
what
happened
with
a
plaintive
truthfulness
not
to
be
imitated
and
throughout
it
joe
guarded
him
from
pitfalls
for
lawyers
in
their
search
after
truth
are
compelled
by
the
exigencies
of
their
profession
to
make
pitfalls
even
for
the
honest
and
gave
him
by
various
devices
time
to
remember
though
not
to
think
and
made
the
words
come
right
in
his
mouth
so
that
before
the
sitting
was
over
a
disquieting
rumor
ran
through
the
waiting
crowd
in
the
corridors
across
the
square
and
over
the
town
that
the
case
was
surely
going
louden
way
this
was
also
the
opinion
of
a
in
canaan
a
counsellor
of
corporations
who
called
to
consultation
with
the
eminent
buckalew
nephew
of
the
squire
had
afterward
spent
an
hour
in
his
company
at
the
trial
it
going
that
young
fellow
louden
way
said
the
stranger
you
say
he
a
shyster
but
well
admitted
buckalew
with
some
reluctance
i
do
mean
that
exactly
i
got
an
old
uncle
who
seems
lately
to
think
he
a
great
man
i
take
your
uncle
word
for
it
returned
the
other
smiling
i
think
he
go
pretty
far
they
had
come
to
the
flight
of
steps
which
descended
to
the
yard
and
the
visitor
looking
down
upon
the
angry
crowd
added
if
they
kill
him
joe
himself
was
anxious
concerning
no
such
matter
he
shook
hands
with
happy
at
the
end
of
the
sitting
bidding
him
be
of
good
cheer
and
when
the
little
man
had
marched
away
under
a
strong
guard
began
to
gather
and
sort
his
papers
at
a
desk
inside
the
bar
this
took
him
perhaps
five
minutes
and
when
he
had
finished
there
were
only
three
people
left
in
the
room
a
clerk
a
negro
janitor
with
a
broom
and
the
darky
friend
who
always
hopefully
accompanies
a
colored
man
holding
high
public
office
these
two
approvingly
greeted
the
young
lawyer
the
janitor
handing
him
a
note
from
norbert
flitcroft
and
the
friend
mechanically
borrowing
a
quarter
from
him
as
he
opened
the
envelope

missive
was
lengthy
and
absorbing
joe
went
on
his
way
perusing
it
with
profound
attention
but
as
he
descended
the
stairway
to
the
floor
below
a
loud
burst
of
angry
shouting
outside
the
building
caused
him
to
hasten
toward
the
big
front
doors
which
faced
main
street
the
doors
opened
upon
an
imposing
vestibule
from
which
a
handsome
flight
of
stone
steps
protected
by
a
marble
balustrade
led
to
the
ground
standing
at
the
top
of
these
steps
and
leaning
over
the
balustrade
he
had
a
clear
view
of
half
the
yard
no
one
was
near
him
everybody
was
running
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
that
corner
of
the
yard
occupied
by
the
jail
the
crowd
centring
upon
an
agitated
whirlpool
of
men
which
moved
slowly
toward
a
door
in
the
high
wall
that
enclosed
the
building
and
joe
saw
that
happy
fear
guards
conducting
the
prisoner
back
to
his
cell
were
being
jostled
and
rushed
the
distance
they
had
made
was
short
but
as
they
reached
the
door
the
pressure
upon
them
increased
dangerously
clubs
rose
in
the
air
hats
flew
the
whirlpool
heaved
tumultuously
and
the
steel
door
clanged
happy
fear
was
safe
inside
but
the
jostlers
were
outside
baffled
ugly
and
stirred
with
the
passion
that
changes
a
crowd
into
a
mob
then
some
of
them
caught
sight
of
joe
as
he
stood
alone
at
the
top
of
the
steps
and
a
great
shout
of
rage
and
exultation
arose
for
a
moment
or
two
he
did
not
see
his
danger
at
the
clang
of
the
door
his
eyes
caught
by
the
gleam
of
a
wide
white
hat
had
turned
toward
the
street
and
he
was
somewhat
fixedly
watching
ladew
extricate
ariel
and
her
aged
and
indignant
escorts
from
an
overflow
of
the
crowd
in
which
they
had
been
caught
but
a
voice
warned
him
the
wild
piping
of
a
newsboy
who
had
climbed
into
a
tree
near
by
joe
louden
he
screamed
look
out
with
a
muffled
roar
the
crowd
surged
back
from
the
jail
and
turned
toward
the
steps
tar
and
feather
him
take
him
over
to
the
river
and
throw
him
in
drown
him
hang
him
then
a
thing
happened
which
was
dramatic
enough
in
its
inception
but
almost
ludicrous
in
its
effect
joe
walked
quietly
down
the
steps
and
toward
the
advancing
mob
with
his
head
cocked
to
one
side
one
eyebrow
lifted
and
one
corner
of
his
mouth
drawn
down
in
a
faintly
distorted
smile
he
went
straight
toward
the
yelling
forerunners
with
only
a
small
bundle
of
papers
in
his
hands
and
then
while
the
spectators
held
their
breath
expecting
the
shock
of
contact
straight
on
through
them
a
number
of
the
formed
the
scattering
van
of
these
forerunners
charging
with
hoarse
and
cruel
shrieks
of
triumph
the
first
apparently
about
to
tear
joseph
louden
to
pieces
changed
countenance
at
swerved
violently
and
with
the
loud
cry
head
him
off
dashed
on
up
the
stone
steps
the
man
next
behind
him
followed
his
lead
with
the
same
shout
strategy
and
haste
then
the
others
of
this
advance
attack
finding
themselves
confronting
the
quiet
man
who
kept
his
even
pace
and
showed
no
intention
of
turning
aside
for
them
turned
suddenly
aside
for
him
and
taking
the
cue
from
the
first
pursued
their
way
bellowing
head
him
off
head
him
off
until
there
were
a
dozen
and
more
rowdyish
men
and
youths
upon
the
steps
their
eyes
blazing
with
fury
menacing
louden
back
with
frightful
gestures
across
the
marble
balustrade
as
they
hysterically
bleated
the
chorus
head
him
off
whether
or
not
joe
could
have
walked
through
the
entire
mob
as
he
had
walked
through
these
is
a
matter
for
speculation
it
was
believed
in
canaan
that
he
could
already
a
gust
of
mirth
began
to
sweep
over
the
sterner
spirits
as
they
paused
to
marvel
no
less
at
the
disconcerting
advance
of
the
lawyer
than
at
the
spectacle
presented
by
the
intrepid
upon
the
steps
a
kind
of
lane
actually
opening
before
the
young
man
as
he
walked
steadily
on
and
when
sheehan
leading
half
a
dozen
huge
men
from
the
farbach
brewery
unceremoniously
shouldered
a
way
through
the
mob
to
joe
side
reaching
him
where
the
press
was
thickest
it
is
a
question
if
the
services
of
his
detachment
were
needed
the
laughter
increased
it
became
voluminous
homeric
salvos
shook
the
air
and
never
one
of
the
upon
the
steps
lived
long
enough
to
live
down
the
hateful
cry
of
that
day
head
him
off
which
was
to
become
a
on
the
streets
a
taunt
more
stinging
than
any
devised
by
deliberate
invention
an
insult
bitterer
than
the
ancestral
doubt
a
and
the
great
historical
joke
of
canaan
never
omitted
in
when
the
tale
was
told
how
joe
louden
took
that
short
walk
across
the
yard
which
made
him
mayor
of
canaan
xxiv
martin
pike
keeps
an
engagement
an
hour
later
martin
pike
looking
forth
from
the
mansion
saw
a
man
open
the
gate
and
passing
between
the
unemotional
deer
rapidly
approach
the
house
he
was
a
thin
young
fellow
very
well
dressed
in
dark
gray
his
hair
prematurely
somewhat
silvered
his
face
prematurely
somewhat
lined
and
his
hat
covered
a
scar
such
as
might
have
been
caused
by
a
blow
from
a
blunt
instrument
in
the
nature
of
a
poker
he
did
not
reach
the
door
nor
was
there
necessity
for
him
to
ring
for
before
he
had
set
foot
on
the
lowest
step
the
judge
had
hastened
to
meet
him
not
however
with
any
fulsomely
hospitable
intent
his
hand
and
arm
were
raised
to
execute
one
of
his
olympian
gestures
of
the
kind
which
had
obliterated
the
young
man
upon
a
certain
morning
louden
looked
up
calmly
at
the
big
figure
towering
above
him
it
wo
do
judge
he
said
that
was
all
but
there
was
a
significance
in
his
manner
and
a
certainty
in
his
voice
which
caused
the
uplifted
hand
to
drop
limply
while
the
look
of
apprehension
which
of
late
had
grown
more
and
more
to
be
martin
pike
habitual
expression
deepened
into
something
close
upon
mortal
anxiety
have
you
any
business
to
set
foot
upon
my
property
he
demanded
yes
answered
joe
that
why
i
came
what
business
have
you
got
with
me
enough
to
satisfy
you
i
think
but
there
one
thing
i
do
want
to
do
joe
glanced
at
the
open
door
and
that
is
to
talk
about
it
here
for
your
own
sake
and
because
i
think
miss
tabor
should
be
present
i
called
to
ask
you
to
come
to
her
house
at
eight
you
did
martin
pike
spoke
angrily
but
not
in
the
of
yore
and
he
kept
his
voice
down
glancing
about
him
nervously
as
though
he
feared
that
his
wife
or
mamie
might
hear
my
accounts
with
her
estate
are
closed
he
said
harshly
if
she
wants
anything
let
her
come
here
joe
shook
his
head
no
you
must
be
there
at
eight
the
judge
choler
got
the
better
of
his
uneasiness
you
a
pretty
one
to
come
ordering
me
around
he
broke
out
you
slanderer
do
you
suppose
i
have
heard
how
you
going
about
traducing
me
undermining
my
character
in
this
community
spreading
scandals
that
i
am
the
real
owner
of
beaver
beach
it
can
easily
be
proved
judge
joe
interrupted
quietly
though
you
wrong
i
have
been
telling
people
i
have
needed
to
even
if
i
wished
once
a
thing
like
that
gets
out
you
ca
stop
it
ever
that
is
all
to
my
knowledge
you
own
other
property
worse
than
the
beach
i
know
that
you
own
half
of
the
worst
dens
in
the
town
profitable
investments
too
you
bought
them
very
gradually
and
craftily
only
showing
the
deeds
to
those
in
charge
as
you
did
to
mike
sheehan
and
not
recording
them
sheehan
betrayal
of
you
gave
me
the
key
i
know
most
of
the
poor
creatures
who
are
your
tenants
too
you
see
and
that
gave
me
an
advantage
because
they
have
some
confidence
in
me
my
investigations
have
been
almost
as
quiet
and
careful
as
your
purchases
you
damned
blackmailer
the
judge
bent
upon
him
a
fierce
inquiring
scrutiny
in
which
oddly
enough
there
was
a
kind
of
haggard
hopefulness
and
out
of
such
stories
he
sneered
you
are
going
to
try
to
make
political
capital
against
the
tocsin
are
you
no
said
joe
it
was
necessary
in
the
interests
of
my
client
for
me
to
know
pretty
thoroughly
just
what
property
you
own
and
i
think
i
do
these
pieces
i
mentioned
are
about
all
you
have
not
mortgaged
you
could
do
that
without
exposure
and
you
kept
a
controlling
interest
in
the
tocsin
clear
too
for
the
sake
of
its
influence
i
suppose
now
do
you
want
to
hear
any
more
or
will
you
agree
to
meet
me
at
miss
tabor
this
evening
whatever
the
look
of
hopefulness
had
signified
it
fled
from
face
during
this
speech
but
he
asked
with
some
show
of
contempt
do
you
think
it
likely
very
well
said
joe
if
you
want
me
to
speak
here
and
he
came
a
little
closer
to
him
you
bought
a
big
block
of
granger
gas
for
roger
tabor
he
began
in
a
low
voice
before
his
death
you
sold
everything
he
had
except
the
old
house
put
it
all
into
cash
for
him
and
bought
that
stock
you
signed
the
check
as
his
and
it
came
back
to
you
through
the
washington
national
where
norbert
flitcroft
handled
it
he
has
a
good
memory
and
when
he
told
me
what
he
knew
i
had
him
to
do
some
tracing
did
a
little
myself
also
judge
pike
i
must
tell
you
that
you
stand
in
danger
of
the
law
you
were
the
custodian
of
that
stock
for
roger
tabor
it
was
transferred
in
blank
though
i
think
you
meant
to
be
at
that
time
and
that
was
merely
for
convenience
in
case
roger
had
wished
you
to
sell
it
for
him
but
just
after
his
death
you
found
yourself
saddled
with
distillery
stock
which
was
going
bad
on
your
hands
other
speculations
of
yours
were
failing
at
the
same
time
you
had
to
have
money
you
filed
your
report
as
administrator
crediting
miss
tabor
with
your
own
stock
which
you
knew
was
going
to
the
wall
and
transferred
hers
to
yourself
then
you
sold
it
because
you
needed
ready
money
you
used
her
fortune
to
save
yourself
but
you
were
horribly
afraid
no
matter
how
rotten
your
transactions
had
been
you
had
always
kept
inside
the
law
and
now
that
you
had
gone
outside
of
it
you
were
frightened
you
did
dare
come
flat
out
to
miss
tabor
with
the
statement
that
her
fortune
had
gone
it
had
been
in
your
charge
all
the
time
and
things
might
look
ugly
so
you
put
it
off
perhaps
from
day
to
day
you
did
dare
tell
her
until
you
were
forced
to
and
to
avoid
the
confession
you
sent
her
the
income
which
was
rightfully
hers
that
was
your
great
weakness
joe
had
spoken
with
great
rapidity
though
keeping
his
voice
low
and
he
lowered
it
again
as
he
continued
judge
pike
what
chance
have
you
to
be
believed
in
court
when
you
swear
that
you
sent
her
twenty
thousand
dollars
out
of
the
goodness
of
your
heart
do
you
think
she
believed
you
it
was
the
very
proof
to
her
that
you
had
robbed
her
for
she
knew
you
do
you
want
to
hear
more
now
do
you
think
this
is
a
good
place
for
it
do
you
wish
me
to
go
over
the
details
of
each
step
i
have
taken
against
you
to
land
you
at
the
bar
where
this
poor
fellow
your
paper
is
hounding
stands
the
judge
essayed
to
answer
and
could
not
he
lifted
his
hand
uncertainly
and
dropped
it
while
a
thick
dew
gathered
on
his
temples
inarticulate
sounds
came
from
between
his
teeth
you
will
come
said
joe
martin
pike
bent
his
head
dazedly
and
at
that
the
other
turned
quickly
from
him
and
went
away
without
looking
back
ariel
was
in
the
studio
half
an
hour
later
when
joe
was
announced
by
the
smiling
mr
warden
ladew
was
with
her
though
upon
the
point
of
taking
his
leave
and
joe
marked
with
a
sinking
heart
that
the
young
minister
cheeks
were
flushed
and
his
eyes
very
bright
it
was
a
magnificent
thing
you
did
louden
he
said
offering
his
hand
heartily
i
saw
it
and
it
was
even
finer
in
one
way
than
it
was
plucky
it
somehow
straightened
things
out
with
such
perfect
good
nature
it
made
those
people
feel
that
what
they
were
doing
was
ridiculous
so
it
was
said
joe
few
under
the
circumstances
could
have
acted
as
if
they
thought
so
and
i
hope
you
let
me
call
upon
you
mr
louden
i
hope
you
will
he
answered
and
then
when
the
minister
had
departed
stood
looking
after
him
with
sad
eyes
in
which
there
dwelt
obscure
meditations
ladew
word
of
farewell
had
covered
a
deep
look
at
ariel
which
was
not
to
be
mistaken
by
joseph
louden
for
anything
other
than
what
it
was
the
clergyman
secret
was
an
open
one
and
joe
saw
that
he
was
as
frank
and
manly
in
love
as
in
all
other
things
he
a
good
fellow
he
said
at
last
sighing
a
good
man
ariel
agreed
and
he
said
more
to
me
than
he
did
to
you
yes
i
think
it
probable
joe
smiled
sorrowfully
about
you
i
mean
he
had
time
to
fear
that
her
look
admitted
confusion
before
she
proceeded
he
said
he
had
never
seen
anything
so
fine
as
your
coming
down
those
steps
ah
he
was
right
but
it
was
harder
for
me
to
watch
you
i
think
than
for
you
to
do
it
joe
i
was
so
horribly
afraid
and
the
crowd
between
us
if
we
could
have
got
near
you
but
we
could
we
she
faltered
and
pressed
her
hand
close
upon
her
eyes
we
asked
joe
slowly
you
mean
you
and
mr
ladew
yes
he
was
there
but
i
mean
her
voice
ran
into
a
little
laugh
with
a
beatific
quaver
in
it
i
mean
colonel
flitcroft
and
bradbury
and
buckalew
too
we
were
hemmed
in
together
when
ladew
found
us
and
oh
joe
when
that
cowardly
rush
started
toward
you
those
three
i
heard
wonderful
things
in
paris
and
naples
cabmen
quarrelling
and
disappointed
beggars
but
never
anything
like
them
you
mean
they
were
profane
oh
magnificently
and
with
such
inventiveness
all
three
begged
my
pardon
afterwards
i
did
grant
it
i
blessed
them
did
they
beg
ladew
pardon
ah
joe
she
reproached
him
he
is
a
prig
and
he
had
to
fight
some
things
that
you
of
all
men
ought
to
understand
he
only
been
here
a
few
months
but
he
told
me
that
judge
pike
has
been
against
him
from
the
start
it
seems
that
ladew
is
too
liberal
in
his
views
and
he
told
me
that
if
it
were
not
for
judge
pike
losing
influence
in
the
church
on
account
of
the
beaver
beach
story
the
judge
would
probably
have
been
able
to
force
him
to
resign
but
now
he
will
stay
he
wishes
to
stay
does
he
very
much
i
think
and
joe
she
continued
thoughtfully
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
i
want
you
to
go
to
church
with
me
next
sunday
to
hear
mr
ladew
yes
i
would
ask
except
for
that
very
well
he
consented
with
averted
eyes
i
go
her
face
was
radiant
with
the
smile
she
gave
him
it
will
make
me
very
happy
she
said
he
bent
his
head
and
fumbled
over
some
papers
he
had
taken
from
his
pocket
will
you
listen
to
these
memoranda
we
have
a
great
deal
to
go
over
before
eight
judge
pike
stood
for
a
long
while
where
joe
had
left
him
staring
out
at
the
street
apparently
really
he
saw
nothing
undoubtedly
an
image
of
blurring
foliage
cement
and
turf
with
sunshine
smeared
over
all
flickered
upon
the
retinas
of
his
eyes
but
the
brain
did
not
accept
the
picture
from
the
optic
nerve
martin
pike
was
busy
with
other
visions
joe
louden
had
followed
him
back
to
his
hidden
deeds
and
had
read
them
aloud
to
him
as
gabriel
would
read
them
on
perhaps
this
was
the
pike
had
taken
charge
of
roger
tabor
affairs
because
the
commissions
as
agent
were
not
too
inconsiderable
to
be
neglected
to
make
the
task
simpler
he
had
sold
as
time
went
on
the
various
properties
of
the
estate
gradually
converting
all
of
them
into
cash
then
the
opportunity
offering
he
bought
a
stock
which
paid
excellent
dividends
had
it
transferred
in
blank
because
if
it
should
prove
to
advantage
to
sell
it
his
agent
could
do
so
without
any
formal
delays
between
paris
and
canaan
at
least
that
is
what
the
judge
had
told
himself
at
the
time
though
it
may
be
that
some
lurking
whisperer
in
his
soul
had
hinted
that
it
might
be
well
to
preserve
the
great
amount
of
cash
in
hand
and
roger
stock
was
practically
that
then
came
the
evil
days
laboriously
he
had
built
up
a
name
for
conservatism
which
most
of
the
town
accepted
but
secretly
he
had
always
been
a
gambler
wall

his
goal
to
adventure
there
as
one
of
the
great
cyclopean
his
fond
ambition
and
he
had
conceived
the
distillery
trust
as
a
means
to
attain
it
but
the
structure
tumbled
about
his
ears
other
edifices
of
his
crumbled
at
the
same
time
he
found
himself
beset
his
solvency
endangered
and
there
was
the
tabor
stock
quite
as
good
as
gold
roger
had
just
died
and
it
was
enough
to
save
save
that
was
a
strange
way
to
be
remembering
it
when
fate
grinned
at
him
out
of
a
dreadful
mask
contorted
like
the
face
of
norbert
flitcroft
martin
pike
knew
himself
for
a
fool
what
chance
had
he
though
he
destroyed
the
check
a
thousand
times
over
to
escape
the
records
by
which
the
coil
of
modern
trade
duplicates
and
quadruplicates
each
slip
of
scribbled
paper
what
chance
had
he
against
the
memories
of
men
would
the
man
of
whom
he
had
bought
forget
that
the
check
was
signed
by
roger
agent
had
the
forgotten
thrice
fool
martin
pike
to
dream
that
in
a
town
like
canaan
norbert
or
any
of
his
kind
could
touch
an
order
for
so
great
a
sum
and
forget
it
but
martin
pike
had
not
dreamed
that
had
dreamed
nothing
when
failure
confronted
him
his
mind
refused
to
consider
anything
but
his
vital
need
at
the
time
and
he
had
supplied
that
need
and
now
he
grew
busy
with
the
future
he
saw
first
the
civil
suit
for
restitution
pressed
with
the
ferocity
and
cunning
of
one
who
intended
to
satisfy
a
grudge
of
years
then
perhaps
a
criminal
prosecution
but
he
would
fight
it
did
they
think
that
such
a
man
was
to
be
overthrown
by
a
breath
of
air
by
a
girl
a
and
a
shyster
lawyer
they
would
find
their
case
difficult
to
prove
in
court
he
did
not
believe
they
could
prove
it
they
would
be
discredited
for
the
attempt
upon
him
and
he
would
win
clear
these
beaver
beach
scandals
would
die
of
inertia
presently
there
would
be
a
lucky
trick
in
wheat
and
martin
pike
would
be
martin
pike
once
more
reinstated
dictator
of
church
politics
business
all
those
things
which
were
the
breath
of
his
life
restored
he
would
show
this
pitiful
pack
what
manner
of
man
they
hounded
norbert
flitcroft
the
judge
put
his
big
hand
up
to
his
eyes
and
rubbed
them
curious
mechanisms
the
eyes
that
deer
in
line
with
the
vision
not
a
zebra
a
zebra
after
all
these
years
and
yet
curious
indeed
the
eyes
a
zebra
who
ever
heard
of
a
deer
with
stripes
the
big
hand
rose
from
the
eyes
and
ran
through
the
hair
which
he
had
always
worn
rather
long
it
would
seem
strange
to
have
it
cut
very
short
did
they
use
clippers
perhaps
he
started
suddenly
and
realized
that
his
neighbor
had
passed
along
the
sidewalk
with
head
averted
pretending
not
to
see
him
a
few
weeks
ago
the
man
would
not
have
missed
the
chance
of
looking
in
to
bow
with
proper
deference
too
did
he
know
he
could
not
know
this
it
must
be
the
beaver
beach
scandal
it
must
be
it
could
not
be
this
not
yet
but
it
might
be
how
many
knew
louden
norbert
ariel
who
else
and
again
the
deer
took
on
the
strange
zebra
look
the
judge
walked
slowly
down
to
the
gate
spoke
to
the
man
he
had
employed
in
sam
warden
place
a
scotchman
who
had
begun
to
refresh
the
lawn
with
a
garden
hose
bowed
affably
in
response
to
the
salutation
of
the
elder
louden
who
was
passing
bound
homeward
from
the
factory
and
returned
to
the
house
with
thoughtful
steps
in
the
hall
he
encountered
his
wife
stopped
to
speak
with
her
upon
various
household
matters
then
entered
the
library
which
was
his
workroom
he
locked
the
door
tried
it
and
shook
the
handle
after
satisfying
himself
of
its
security
he
pulled
down
the
carefully
and
lighting
a
gas
upon
his
desk
began
to
fumble
with
various
documents
which
he
took
from
a
small
safe
near
by
but
his
hands
were
not
steady
he
dropped
the
papers
scattering
them
over
the
floor
and
had
great
difficulty
in
picking
them
up
he
perspired
heavily
whatever
he
touched
became
damp
and
he
continually
mopped
his
forehead
with
his
sleeve
after
a
time
he
gave
up
the
attempt
to
sort
the
packets
of
papers
sank
into
a
chair
despairingly
leaving
most
of
them
in
disorder
a
light
tap
sounded
on
the
door
martin
it
with
a
great
effort
he
made
shift
to
answer
yes
i
know
you
and
mamie
go
ahead
i
too
busy
i
do
want
anything
a
moment
before
he
had
been
a
pitiful
figure
face
distraught
hands
incoherent
the
whole
body
incoordinate
but
if
eyes
might
have
rested
upon
him
as
he
answered
his
wife
they
would
have
seen
a
strange
thing
he
sat
apparently
steady
and
collected
his
expression
cool
his
body
quiet
poised
exactly
to
the
quality
of
his
reply
for
the
same
strange
reason
that
a
young
girl
smiles
archly
and
coquettes
to
a
telephone
but
martin
you
ought
to
work
so
hard
you
break
down
no
fear
of
that
he
replied
cheerfully
you
can
leave
something
on
the
sideboard
for
me
after
another
fluttering
remonstrance
she
went
away
and
the
room
was
silent
again
his
arms
rested
upon
the
desk
and
his
head
slowly
sank
between
his
elbows
when
he
lifted
it
again
the
clock
on
the
had
tinkled
once
it
was
seven
he
took
a
sheet
of
from
a
box
before
him
and
began
to
write
but
when
he
had
finished
the
words
my
dear
wife
and
mamie
his
fingers
shook
so
violently
that
he
could
go
no
further
he
placed
his
left
hand
over
the
back
of
his
right
to
steady
it
but
found
the
device
unavailing
the
pen
left
mere
zigzags
on
the
page
and
he
dropped
it
he
opened
a
lower
drawer
of
the
desk
and
took
out
of
it
a
pistol
rose
went
to
the
door
tried
it
once
more
and
again
was
satisfied
of
his
seclusion
then
he
took
the
weapon
in
both
hands
the
handle
against
his
fingers
one
thumb
against
the
trigger
and
shaking
with
nausea
lifted
it
to
the
level
of
his
eyes
his
will
betrayed
him
he
could
not
contract
his
thumb
upon
the
trigger
and
with
a
convulsive
shiver
he
dropped
the
revolver
upon
the
desk
he
locked
the
door
of
the
room
behind
him
crept
down
the
stairs
and
out
of
the
he
walked
shamblingly
when
he
reached
the
street
keeping
close
to
the
fences
as
he
went
on
now
and
then
touching
the
pickets
with
his
hands
like
a
feeble
old
man
he
had
always
been
prompt
it
was
one
of
the
things
of
which
he
had
been
proud
in
all
his
life
he
had
never
failed
to
keep
a
business
engagement
precisely
upon
the
appointed
time
and
the
bell
clanged
eight
when
sam
warden
opened
the
door
for
his
old
employer
the
two
young
people
looked
up
gravely
from
the
table
before
them
as
martin
pike
came
into
the
strong
lamplight
out
of
the
dimness
of
the
hall
where
only
a
taper
burned
he
shambled
a
few
limp
steps
into
the
room
and
came
to
a
halt
big
as
he
was
his
clothes
hung
upon
him
loosely
like
coverlets
upon
a
collapsed
bed
and
he
seemed
but
a
distorted
image
of
himself
as
if
save
for
the
dull
and
reddened
eyes
he
had
been
made
of
yellowish
wax
and
had
been
left
too
long
in
the
sun
abject
hopeless
his
attitude
a
confession
of
ruin
and
shame
he
stood
before
his
judges
in
such
wretchedness
that
in
comparison
the
figure
of
happy
fear
facing
the
through
his
darkest
hour
was
one
to
be
envied
well
he
said
brokenly
what
are
you
going
to
do
joe
louden
looked
at
him
with
great
intentness
for
several
moments
then
he
rose
and
came
forward
sit
down
judge
he
said
it
all
right
do
worry
xxv
the
jury
comes
in
flitcroft
at
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
continued
a
disquisition
which
had
ceased
the
previous
night
only
because
of
a
provoking
human
incapacity
to
exist
without
sleep
her
theme
was
one
which
had
exclusively
occupied
her
since
the
passing
of
eskew
and
her
rheumatism
having
improved
so
that
she
could
leave
her
chair
she
had
become
a
sort
of
walking
serial
norbert
and
his
grandfather
being
well
assured
that
whenever
they
left
the
house
the
same
story
was
to
be
continued
upon
their
reappearance
the
tocsin
had
been
her
great
comfort
she
was
but
one
helpless
woman
against
two
strong
men
therefore
she
sorely
needed
assistance
in
her
attack
upon
them
and
the
invaluable
newspaper
gave
it
in
generous
measure
yes
young
man
she
said
as
she
lifted
her
first
spoonful
of
oatmeal
you
better
read
the
tocsin
i
am
reading
it
responded
norbert
who
was
almost
concealed
by
the
paper
and
your
grandfather
better
read
it
she
continued
severely
i
already
have
said
the
colonel
promptly
have
you
no
but
you
can
be
sure
i
will
the
good
lady
gave
the
effect
of
tossing
her
head
and
you
better
take
what
it
says
to
heart
you
and
some
others
it
a
wonder
to
me
that
you
and
buckalew
and
old
peter
do
go
and
hold
that
happy
fear
hand
durin
the
trial
and
as
for
joe
louden
his
own
sister
jane
says
to
me
only
yesterday
afternoon
law
flitcroft
she
says
a
wonder
to
me
she
says
your
husband
and
those
two
other
old
fools
do
lay
down
in
the
gutter
and
let
that
joe
louden
walk
over
did
jane
quimby
say
two
other
old
fools
inquired
the
colonel
in
a
manner
which
indicated
that
he
might
see
quimby
in
regard
to
the
slander
i
ca
say
as
i
remember
just
precisely
her
exact
words
admitted
flitcroft
but
that
was
the
sense
of
you
made
yourselves
the
of
the
whole
town
oh
we
have
and
i
like
to
know
her
voice
became
shrill
and
goading
i
like
to
know
what
judge
pike
thinks
of
you
and
norbert
i
should
think
you
be
ashamed
to
have
him
pass
you
in
the
street
i
quit
speaking
to
him
said
norbert
coldly
ever
since
i
heard
he
owned
beaver
beach
that
story
ai
proved
yet
returned
his
grandmother
with
much
irascibility
well
it
will
be
but
that
not
all
norbert
wagged
his
head
you
may
be
a
little
surprised
within
the
next
few
days
i
been
surprised
for
the
past
few
she
replied
with
a
bitterness
which
overrode
her
satisfaction
in
the
effectiveness
of
the
retort
surprised
i
like
to
know
who
would
be
surprised
when
half
the
town
acts
like
it
gone
crazy
people
praisin
that
fellow
that
nobody
in
their
sober
minds
and
senses
never
in
their
lives
had
a
good
word
for
before
why
there
was
more
talk
yesterday
about
his
at
the
you
of
thought
he
was
phil
sheridan
it
louden
here
and
louden
there
and
louden
this
and
louden
that
till
i
sick
of
the
name
then
why
do
you
quit
saying
it
asked
the
colonel
reasonably
because
it
ought
to
be
said
she
exclaimed
with
great
heat
because
he
ought
to
be
held
up
to
the
community
to
be
despised
you
let
me
have
that
paper
a
minute
she
pursued
vehemently
you
just
let
me
have
the
tocsin
and
i
read
you
out
some
things
about
him
that
show
him
in
his
true
light
all
right
said
norbert
suddenly
handing
her
the
paper
go
ahead
and
after
the
exchange
of
a
single
glance
the
two
gentlemen
composed
themselves
to
listen
ha
exclaimed
flitcroft
here
it
is
in
on
the
first
page
scores
again
and
again
ridiculous
behavior
of
a
mob
louden
she
paused
removed
her
spectacles
examined
them
dubiously
restored
them
to
place
and
continued
masterly
conduct
and
she
paused
again
incredulous
triumph
go
on
said
the
colonel
softly
indeed
i
will
the
old
lady
replied
do
you
think
i
do
know
sarcasm
when
i
see
it
ha
ha
she
laughed
with
great
heartiness
i
reckon
i
will
go
on
you
listen
and
try
to
learn
something
from
it
she
resumed
the
reading
is
generally
admitted
that
after
yesterday
sitting
of
the
court
the
prosecution
in
the
murder
trial
has
not
a
leg
to
stand
on
louden
fight
for
his
client
has
been
it
must
be
confessed
of
a
most
splendid
and
talented
order
and
the
bottom
has
fallen
out
of
the
case
for
the
state
while
a
verdict
of
not
guilty
it
is
now
conceded
is
the
general
wish
of
those
who
have
attended
and
followed
the
trial
but
the
most
interesting
event
of
the
day
took
place
after
the
session
when
some
miscreants
undertook
to
mob
the
attorney
for
the
defence
in
the
yard
he
met
the
attack
with
a
coolness
and
nerve
which
have
won
him
a
popularity
that
flitcroft
again
faltered
go
on
repeated
the
colonel
there
a
great
deal
more
look
at
the
editorials
suggested
norbert
there
one
on
the
same
subject
flitcroft
her
theory
of
the
tocsin
sarcasm
somewhat
shaken
turned
the
page
we
confess
a
mistake
was
the
rubric
above
the
leader
and
she
uttered
a
cry
of
triumph
for
she
thought
the
mistake
was
what
she
had
just
been
reading
and
that
the
editorial
would
apologize
for
the
incomprehensible
journalistic
error
upon
the
first
page
best
of
us
make
mistakes
and
it
is
well
to
have
a
change
of
heart
sometimes
thus
eugene
successor
had
written
and
so
flitcroft
read
open
confession
is
good
for
the
soul
the
tocsin
has
changed
its
mind
in
regard
to
certain
matters
and
means
to
say
so
freely
and
frankly
after
yesterday
events
in
connection
with
the
murder
trial
before
our
public
the
evidence
being
now
all
presented
for
we
understand
that
neither
side
has
more
to
offer
it
is
generally
conceded
that
all
good
citizens
are
hopeful
of
a
verdict
of
acquittal
and
the
tocsin
is
a
good
citizen
no
good
citizen
would
willingly
see
an
innocent
man
punished
and
that
our
city
is
not
to
be
disgraced
by
such
a
miscarriage
of
justice
is
due
to
the
efforts
of
the
attorney
for
the
defendant
who
has
gained
credit
not
only
by
his
masterly
management
of
this
case
but
by
his
splendid
conduct
in
the
face
of
danger
yesterday
afternoon
he
has
distinguished
himself
so
greatly
that
we
frankly
assert
that
our
citizens
may
point
with
pride
to
flitcroft
voice
at
the
beginning
pitched
to
a
high
exultation
had
gradually
lowered
in
key
and
dropped
down
the
scale
till
it
disappeared
altogether
it
a
wonder
to
me
the
colonel
began
that
the
tocsin
does
go
and
hold
joe
louden
hand
i
read
the
rest
of
it
for
you
said
norbert
his
heavy
face
lighting
up
with
cruelty
let
see
where
were
you
oh
yes
with
pride
citizens
may
point
with
pride
to
let
us
not
linger
to
observe
the
unmanly
behavior
of
an
aged
man
and
his
grandson
left
alone
at
the
by
a
defenceless
woman
the
tocsin
undermined
others
besides
flitcroft
that
morning
and
rejoiced
greater
though
not
better
men
than
the
colonel
farbach
and
his
lieutenants
smiled
yet
stared
amazed
wondering
what
had
happened
that
was
a
thing
which
only
three
people
even
certainly
knew
yet
it
was
very
simple
the
tocsin
was
part
of
the
judge
restitution
the
controlling
interest
in
the
paper
together
with
the
other
property
i
have
listed
joe
had
said
studying
his
memoranda
under
the
lamp
in
roger
old
studio
while
martin
pike
listened
with
his
head
in
his
hands
make
up
what
miss
tabor
is
willing
to
accept
as
i
estimate
it
their
total
value
is
between
a
third
and
a
half
of
that
of
the
stock
which
belonged
to
her
but
this
boy
this
flitcroft
said
pike
feebly
he
might
he
will
do
nothing
interrupted
joe
the
case
is
out
of
court
and
even
if
he
were
disposed
to
harass
you
he
could
hardly
hope
to
succeed
since
miss
tabor
declines
either
to
sue
or
to
prosecute
the
judge
winced
at
the
last
word
yes
yes
i
know
but
he
might
he
might
tell
i
think
miss
tabor
influence
will
prevent
if
it
should
not
well
you
not
in
a
desperate
case
by
any
means
you
involved
but
far
from
stripped
in
time
you
may
be
as
sound
as
ever
and
if
norbert
tells
there
nothing
for
you
to
do
but
to
live
it
down
a
faint
smile
played
upon
joe
lips
as
he
lifted
his
head
and
looked
at
the
other
it
can
be
done
i
think
it
was
then
that
ariel
complaining
of
the
warmth
of
the
evening
thought
it
possible
that
joe
might
find
her
fan
upon
the
porch
and
as
he
departed
whispered
hurriedly
judge
pike
i
not
technically
in
control
of
the
tocsin
but
have
i
the
right
to
control
its
policy
i
understand
he
muttered
you
mean
about
louden
about
this
trial
that
is
why
i
have
taken
the
paper
you
want
all
that
changed
you
mean
she
nodded
decisively
from
this
instant
before
morning
oh
well
i
go
down
there
and
give
the
word
he
rubbed
his
eyes
wearily
with
big
thumbs
i
through
fighting
i
done
besides
what
the
use
there
nothing
more
to
fight
now
judge
joe
said
as
he
came
in
briskly
we
go
over
the
list
of
that
unencumbered
property
if
you
will
this
unencumbered
property
consisted
of
beaver
beach
and
those
other
belongings
of
the
judge
which
he
had
not
dared
to
mortgage
joe
had
somehow
explained
their
nature
to
ariel
and
these
with
the
tocsin
she
had
elected
to
accept
in
restitution
you
told
me
once
that
i
ought
to
look
after
my
own
property
and
now
i
will
do
you
see
she
cried
to
joe
eagerly
it
my
work
she
resolutely
set
aside
every
other
proposition
and
this
was
the
quality
of
mercy
which
martin
pike
found
that
night
there
was
a
great
crowd
to
hear
joe
at
the
trial
and
those
who
succeeded
in
getting
into
the
declared
that
it
was
worth
the
struggle
he
did
not
orate
he
did
not
thunder
at
the
jury
nor
did
he
slyly
flatter
them
he
did
not
overdo
the
confidential
nor
seem
so
secure
of
understanding
beforehand
what
their
verdict
would
be
that
they
felt
an
instinctive
desire
to
fool
him
he
talked
colloquially
but
clearly
without
appeal
to
the
pathetic
and
without
garnitures
not
mentioning
sunsets
birds
oceans
homes
the
glorious
old
state
or
the
happiness
of
liberty
but
he
made
everybody
in
the
room
quite
sure
that
happy
fear
had
fired
the
shot
which
killed
cory
to
save
his
own
life
and
that
as
bradbury
remarked
to
the
colonel
was
what
joe
was
there
for
ariel
escort
was
increased
to
four
that
day
ladew
sat
beside
her
and
there
were
times
when
joe
kept
his
mind
entirely
to
the
work
in
hand
only
by
an
effort
but
he
always
succeeded
the
sight
of
the
pale
and
worshipping
face
of
happy
fear
from
the
corner
of
his
eye
was
enough
to
insure
that
and
people
who
could
not
get
near
the
doors
asking
those
who
could
what
he
doin
now
were
answered
by
variations
of
the
one
formula
oh
jest
walkin
away
with
it
once
the
was
disturbed
and
set
in
an
uproar
which
even
the
judge
customary
threat
failed
to
subdue
joe
had
been
talking
very
rapidly
and
having
turned
the
point
he
was
making
with
perfect
dexterity
the
jury
listening
eagerly
stopped
for
a
moment
to
take
a
swallow
of
water
a
voice
rose
over
the
low
hum
of
the
crowd
in
a
delirious
chuckle
why
do
somebody
him
off
the
room
instantly
rocked
with
laughter
under
cover
of
which
the
identity
of
the
sacrilegious
chuckler
was
not
discovered
but
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
buckalew
who
was
incredibly
surprised
to
find
that
he
had
spoken
aloud
the
jury
were
out
after
the
case
had
been
given
to
them
seventeen
minutes
and
thirty
seconds
by
the
watch
claudine
held
in
her
hand
the
little
man
whose
fate
was
now
on
the
knees
of
the
gods
looked
pathetically
at
the
foreman
and
then
at
the
face
of
his
lawyer
and
began
to
shake
violently
but
not
with
fright
he
had
gone
to
the
jail
on
joe
word
as
a
good
dog
goes
where
his
master
bids
trustfully
and
yet
happy
had
not
been
able
to
keep
his
mind
from
considering
the
horrible
chances
do
worry
joe
had
said
it
all
right
see
you
through
and
he
had
kept
his
word
the
little
man
was
cleared
it
took
happy
a
long
time
to
get
through
what
he
had
to
say
to
his
attorney
in
the
anteroom
and
even
then
of
course
he
did
not
manage
to
put
it
in
words
for
he
had
broken
down
with
sheer
gratitude
why
damn
me
joe
he
sobbed
if
ever
i
if
ever
you
well
by
god
if
you
ever
this
was
the
substance
of
his
lingual
accomplishment
under
the
circumstances
but
claudine
threw
her
arms
around
poor
neck
and
kissed
him
many
people
were
waiting
to
shake
hands
with
joe
and
congratulate
him
the
trio
taking
advantage
of
seats
near
the
rail
had
already
done
that
somewhat
uproariously
before
he
had
followed
happy
and
so
had
ariel
and
ladew
both
necessarily
rather
hurriedly
but
in
the
corridors
he
found
when
he
came
out
of
the
anteroom
clients
acquaintances
friends
old
friends
new
friends
and
friends
he
had
never
seen
before
everybody
beaming
upon
him
and
wringing
his
hand
as
if
they
had
been
sure
of
it
all
from
the
start
know
him
said
one
to
another
why
i
knowed
him
sence
he
was
that
high
smart
little
feller
he
was
too
this
was
a
total
stranger
i
said
years
ago
thus
brown
the
national
house
clerk
proving
his
prophetic
vision
that
he
turn
out
to
be
a
big
man
some
day
they
gathered
round
him
if
he
stopped
for
an
instant
and
crowded
after
him
admiringly
when
he
went
on
again
making
his
progress
slow
when
he
finally
came
out
of
the
big
doors
into
the
sunshine
there
were
as
many
people
in
the
yard
as
there
had
been
when
he
stood
in
the
same
place
and
watched
the
mob
rushing
his
client
guards
but
their
temper
was
different
and
as
he
paused
a
moment
looking
down
on
the
upturned
laughing
faces
with
a
hundred
jocular
and
congratulatory
salutations
shouted
up
at
him
somebody
started
a
cheer
and
it
was
taken
up
with
thunderous
there
followed
the
interrogation
customary
in
such
emergencies
and
the
anxious
inquirer
was
informed
by
four
or
five
hundred
people
simultaneously
that
joe
louden
was
all
right
head
him
off
bellowed
mike
sheehan
suddenly
darting
up
the
steps
the
shout
increased
and
with
good
reason
for
he
stepped
quickly
back
within
the
doors
and
retreating
through
the
building
made
good
his
escape
by
a
basement
door
he
struck
off
into
a
long
detour
but
though
he
managed
to
evade
the
crowd
he
had
to
stop
and
shake
hands
with
every
third
person
he
met
as
he
came
out
upon
main
street
again
he
encountered
his
father
howdy
do
joe
said
this
laconic
person
and
offered
his
hand
they
shook
briefly
well
he
continued
rubbing
his
beard
how
are
ye
all
right
father
i
think
satisfied
with
the
verdict
i
be
pretty
hard
to
please
if
i
were
joe
laughed
louden
rubbed
his
beard
again
i
was
there
he
said
without
emotion
at
the
trial
you
mean
yes
he
offered
his
hand
once
more
and
again
they
shook
well
come
around
and
see
us
he
said
thank
you
i
will
well
said
louden
joe
father
the
young
man
stood
looking
after
him
with
a
curious
smile
then
he
gave
a
slight
start
far
up
the
street
he
saw
two
figures
one
a
lady
in
white
with
a
wide
white
hat
the
other
a
man
wearing
recognizably
clerical
black
they
seemed
to
be
walking
very
slowly
it
had
been
a
day
of
triumph
for
joe
but
in
all
his
life
he
never
slept
worse
than
he
did
that
night
xxvi
ancient
of
days
he
woke
to
the
chiming
of
bells
and
as
his
eyes
slowly
opened
the
sorrowful
people
of
a
dream
who
seemed
to
be
bending
over
him
weeping
swam
back
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
whence
they
had
come
and
returned
to
the
imperceptible
leaving
their
shadows
in
his
heart
slowly
he
rose
stumbled
into
the
outer
room
and
released
the
fluttering
shade
but
the
sunshine
springing
like
a
golden
lover
through
the
open
window
only
dazzled
him
and
found
no
answering
gladness
to
greet
it
nor
joy
in
the
royal
day
it
heralded
and
yet
to
the
newly
cleaned
boys
on
their
way
to
midsummer
morning
the
breath
of
that
cool
august
day
was
as
sweet
as
stolen
apples
no
doubt
the
stir
of
far
green
thickets
and
the
twinkle
of
creeks
shimmered
in
the
longing
vision
of
their
minds
eyes
even
so
they
were
merry
but
joseph
louden
sighing
as
he
descended
his
narrow
stairs
with
the
bitterness
still
upon
his
lips
of
the
frightful
coffee
he
had
made
heard
the
echo
of
their
laughter
with
wonder
it
would
be
an
hour
at
least
before
time
to
start
to
church
when
ariel
expected
him
he
stared
absently
up
the
street
then
down
and
after
that
began
slowly
to
walk
in
the
latter
direction
with
no
very
active
consciousness
or
care
of
where
he
went
he
had
fallen
into
a
profound
reverie
so
deep
that
when
he
had
crossed
the
bridge
and
turned
into
a
dusty
road
which
ran
along
the
he
stopped
mechanically
beside
the
trunk
of
a
fallen
sycamore
and
lifting
his
head
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
set
out
looked
about
him
with
a
melancholy
perplexity
a
little
surprised
to
find
himself
there
for
this
was
the
spot
where
he
had
first
seen
the
new
ariel
and
on
that
fallen
sycamore
they
had
sat
together
remember
across
main
street
bridge
at
noon
and
joe
cheeks
burned
as
he
recalled
why
he
had
not
understood
the
clear
voice
that
had
haunted
him
but
that
shame
had
fallen
from
him
she
had
changed
all
that
as
she
had
changed
so
many
things
he
sank
down
in
the
long
grass
with
his
back
against
the
log
and
stared
out
over
the
fields
of
tall
corn
shaking
in
a
steady
wind
all
the
way
to
the
horizon
changed
so
many
things
he
said
half
aloud
everything
ah
yes
she
had
changed
the
whole
world
for
joseph
louden
at
his
first
sight
of
her
and
now
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
to
lose
her
but
not
in
the
way
he
had
thought
almost
from
the
very
first
he
had
the
feeling
that
nothing
so
beautiful
as
that
she
should
stay
in
canaan
could
happen
to
him
he
was
sure
that
she
was
but
for
the
little
while
that
her
coming
was
like
the
flying
petals
of
which
he
had
told
her
he
had
lain
upon
the
earth
and
she
had
lifted
him
up
for
a
moment
he
had
felt
the
beatific
wings
enfolding
him
with
gentle
protection
and
then
saw
them
lifted
to
bear
the
angel
beyond
his
sight
for
it
was
incredible
that
the
gods
so
loved
joe
louden
that
they
would
make
greater
gifts
to
him
than
this
little
time
with
her
which
they
had
granted
him
changed
so
many
things
the
bars
that
had
been
between
him
and
half
of
his
world
were
down
shattered
never
more
to
be
replaced
and
the
ban
of
canaan
was
lifted
could
this
have
been
save
for
her
and
upon
that
thought
he
got
to
his
feet
uttering
an
exclamation
of
bitter
asking
himself
angrily
what
he
was
doing
he
knew
how
much
she
gave
him
what
full
measure
of
her
affection
was
not
that
enough
out
upon
you
louden
are
you
to
sulk
in
your
tent
dour
in
the
gloom
or
to
play
a
man
part
and
if
she
be
happy
turn
a
cheery
face
upon
her
joy
and
thus
this
pilgrim
recrossed
the
bridge
emerging
to
the
street
with
his
head
up
smiling
and
his
shoulders
thrown
back
so
that
none
might
see
the
burden
he
carried
ariel
was
waiting
on
the
porch
for
him
she
wore
the
same
dress
she
had
worn
that
sunday
of
their
tryst
that
exquisite
dress
with
the
faint
lavender
overtint
like
the
tender
colors
of
the
beautiful
day
he
made
his
own
she
had
not
worn
it
since
and
he
was
far
distant
when
he
caught
the
first
flickering
glimpse
of
her
through
the
lower
branches
of
the
maples
but
he
remembered
and
again
as
on
that
day
he
heard
a
ineffable
music
the
horns
sounding
the
mysterious
reveille
which
had
wakened
his
soul
to
her
coming
she
came
to
the
gate
to
meet
him
and
gave
him
her
hand
in
greeting
without
a
word
or
the
need
of
one
from
either
then
together
they
set
forth
over
the
pavement
the
maples
swishing
above
them
heavier
branches
crooning
in
the
strong
breeze
under
a
sky
like
a
della
robbia
background
and
up
against
the
glorious
blue
of
it
some
laughing
invisible
god
was
blowing
small
rounded
clouds
of
pure
cotton
as
children
blow
thistledown
when
he
opened
her
parasol
as
they
came
out
into
the
broad
sunshine
beyond
upper
main
street
there
was
the
faintest
mingling
of
wild
roses
and
cinnamon
loosed
on
the
air
joe
she
said
i
very
happy
that
right
he
returned
heartily
i
think
you
always
will
be
but
oh
i
wish
she
went
on
that
arp
could
have
lived
to
see
you
come
down
the
steps
god
bless
him
said
joe
i
can
hear
the
those
dear
old
men
have
been
so
loyal
to
you
joe
no
he
returned
loyal
to
eskew
to
you
both
she
said
i
afraid
the
old
circle
is
broken
up
they
have
met
on
the
national
house
corner
since
he
died
the
colonel
told
me
he
could
bear
to
go
there
again
i
do
believe
any
of
them
ever
will
he
returned
and
yet
i
never
pass
the
place
that
i
do
see
eskew
in
his
old
chair
i
went
there
last
night
to
commune
with
him
i
could
sleep
and
i
got
up
and
went
over
there
they
left
the
chairs
out
the
town
was
asleep
and
it
was
beautiful
moonlight
to
commune
with
him
what
about
you
why
she
asked
plainly
mystified
i
stood
in
need
of
good
counsel
he
answered
cheerfully
or
a
friendly
word
perhaps
and
as
i
sat
there
after
a
while
it
came
what
was
it
to
forget
that
i
was
sodden
with
selfishness
to
pretend
not
to
be
as
full
of
meanness
as
i
really
was
does
that
seem
to
be
eskew
own
voice
were
you
happy
last
night
joe
oh
it
was
all
right
he
said
quickly
do
you
worry
and
at
this
old
speech
of
his
she
broke
into
a
little
laugh
of
which
he
had
no
comprehension
mamie
came
to
see
me
early
this
morning
she
said
after
they
had
walked
on
in
silence
for
a
time
everything
is
all
right
with
her
again
that
is
i
think
it
will
be
eugene
is
coming
home
and
she
added
thoughtfully
it
will
be
best
for
him
to
have
his
old
place
on
the
tocsin
again
she
showed
me
his
letter
and
i
liked
it
i
think
he
been
through
the
fire
joe
distorted
smile
appeared
and
has
come
out
gold
he
asked
no
she
laughed
but
nearer
it
and
i
think
he
try
to
be
more
worth
her
caring
for
she
has
always
thought
that
his
leaving
the
tocsin
in
the
way
he
did
was
heroic
that
was
her
word
for
it
and
it
was
the
finest
thing
he
ever
did
i
ca
figure
eugene
out
joe
shook
his
head
there
something
behind
his
going
away
that
i
do
understand
this
was
altogether
the
truth
nor
was
there
ever
to
come
a
time
when
either
he
or
mamie
would
understand
what
things
had
determined
the
departure
of
eugene
bantry
though
mamie
never
questioned
as
joe
did
the
reasons
for
it
or
doubted
those
eugene
had
given
her
which
were
the
same
he
had
given
her
father
for
she
was
content
with
his
return
again
the
bells
across
the
square
rang
out
their
chime
the
paths
were
decorously
enlivened
with
family
and
neighborhood
groups
bound
churchward
and
the
rumble
of
the
organ
playing
the
people
into
their
pews
shook
on
the
air
and
joe
knew
that
he
must
speak
quickly
if
he
was
to
say
what
he
had
planned
to
say
before
he
and
ariel
went
into
the
church
ariel
he
tried
to
compel
his
voice
to
a
casual
cheerfulness
but
it
would
do
nothing
for
him
except
betray
a
desperate
embarrassment
she
looked
at
him
quickly
and
as
quickly
away
yes
i
wanted
to
say
something
to
you
and
i
better
do
it
now
i
think
before
i
go
to
church
for
the
first
time
in
two
years
he
managed
to
laugh
though
with
some
ruefulness
and
continued
stammeringly
i
want
to
tell
you
how
much
i
like
him
how
much
i
admire
him
admire
whom
she
asked
a
little
coldly
for
she
knew
mr
ladew
so
do
i
she
answered
looking
straight
ahead
that
is
one
reason
why
i
wanted
you
to
come
with
me
it
is
only
that
i
want
to
tell
you
to
tell
you
he
broke
off
for
a
second
you
remember
that
night
in
my
office
before
fear
came
in
yes
i
remember
and
that
i
that
something
i
said
troubled
you
because
it
it
sounded
as
if
i
cared
too
much
for
you
no
not
too
much
she
still
looked
straight
ahead
they
were
walking
very
slowly
you
did
understand
you
been
in
my
mind
you
see
all
those
years
so
much
more
than
i
in
yours
i
forgotten
you
but
to
you
i
was
really
a
stranger
no
no
he
cried
yes
i
was
she
said
gently
but
very
quickly
and
i
i
did
want
you
to
fall
in
love
with
me
at
first
sight
and
yet
perhaps
i
did
but
i
had
thought
of
things
in
that
way
i
had
just
the
same
feeling
for
you
that
i
always
had
always
i
had
never
cared
so
much
for
any
one
else
and
it
seemed
to
me
the
most
necessary
thing
in
my
life
to
come
back
to
that
old
companionship
do
you
remember
it
used
to
trouble
you
so
when
i
would
take
your
hand
i
think
i
loved
your
being
a
little
rough
with
me
and
once
when
i
saw
how
you
had
been
hurt
that
day
you
ran
away
ariel
he
gasped
helplessly
have
you
forgotten
he
gathered
himself
together
with
all
his
will
i
want
to
prove
to
you
he
said
resolutely
that
the
dear
kindness
of
you
is
thrown
away
on
me
i
want
you
to
know
what
i
began
to
say
that
it
all
right
with
me
and
i
think
ladew
he
stopped
again
ah
i
seen
how
much
he
cares
for
you
have
you
ariel
he
said
that
is
fair
to
me
if
you
trust
me
you
could
not
have
helped
seeing
but
i
have
not
seen
it
she
interrupted
with
great
calmness
after
having
said
this
she
finished
truthfully
if
he
did
i
would
never
let
him
tell
me
i
like
him
too
much
you
mean
you
not
going
to
suddenly
she
turned
to
him
no
she
said
with
a
depth
of
anger
he
had
not
heard
in
her
voice
since
that
winter
day
when
she
struck
eugene
bantry
with
her
clenched
fist
she
swept
over
him
a
blinding
look
of
reproach
how
could
i
and
there
upon
the
steps
of
the
church
in
the
sudden
dazzling
vision
of
her
love
fell
the
burden
of
him
who
had
made
his
sorrowful
pilgrimage
across
main
street
bridge
that
morning
a
manifold
rustling
followed
them
as
they
went
down
the
aisle
and
the
sibilance
of
many
whisperings
but
joe
was
not
conscious
of
that
as
he
took
his
place
in
ariel
pew
beside
her
for
him
there
was
only
the
presence
of
divinity
the
church
was
filled
with
it
they
rose
to
sing
ancient
of
days
who
sittest
throned
in
glory
to
thee
all
knees
are
bent
all
voices
pray
thy
love
has
blest
the
wide
world
wondrous
story
with
light
and
life
since
eden
dawning
day
and
then
as
they
knelt
to
pray
there
were
the
white
heads
of
the
three
old
friends
of
eskew
arp
and
beyond
was
the
silver
hair
of
martin
pike
who
knelt
beside
his
daughter
joe
felt
that
people
should
be
very
kind
to
the
judge
the
sun
so
eager
without
came
temperately
through
the
windows
where
stood
angels
and
saints
in
gentle
colors
and
the
face
of
the
young
minister
in
this
quiet
light
was
like
the
faces
in
the
windows
not
only
to
confront
your
enemies
he
said
that
is
not
enough
nor
is
it
that
i
would
have
you
bluster
at
them
nor
take
arms
against
them
you
will
not
have
to
do
that
if
when
they
come
at
you
you
do
not
turn
one
inch
aside
but
with
an
assured
heart
with
good
nature
not
noisily
and
with
steadfastness
you
keep
on
your
way
if
you
can
do
that
i
say
that
they
will
turn
aside
for
you
and
you
shall
walk
straight
through
them
and
only
laughter
be
left
of
their
anger
there
was
a
stir
among
the
people
and
many
faces
turned
toward
joe
two
years
ago
he
had
sat
in
the
same
church
when
his
character
and
actions
had
furnished
the
underlying
theme
of
a
sermon
and
he
had
recognized
himself
without
difficulty
he
had
not
the
shadow
of
a
dream
that
the
same
thing
was
happening
he
thought
the
people
were
turning
to
look
at
ariel
and
he
was
very
far
from
wondering
at
that
she
saw
that
he
did
not
understand
she
was
glad
to
have
it
so
she
had
taken
off
her
gloves
and
he
was
holding
them
lightly
and
reverently
in
his
hands
looking
down
upon
them
his
thin
cheeks
a
little
flushed
and
at
that
and
not
knowing
the
glory
that
was
in
his
soul
something
forlorn
in
his
careful
tenderness
toward
her
gloves
so
touched
her
that
she
felt
the
tears
coming
to
her
eyes
with
a
sudden
rush
and
to
prevent
them
not
the
empty
gloves
joe
she
whispered
