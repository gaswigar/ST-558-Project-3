the

so
violently
that

and

tumbled
out

he
shrieked
there

rubbing

his

where

him
severely
upon

stood
the

cake
as

perfect
as

all
the

in

there

in

they
were
in
a
furious
argument
not

with
words

with
spoons

and
bowls
and
dear
knows
what
would
have
become
of
the
cake
had
not
a
bell
rung
loudly
and
the
second
footman
poked
his
head
through
the
door
the
cake
where
is
the
cake
he
wheezed
importantly
so
eejabo
dodging
three
cups
and
a
salt
cellar
seized
the
great
silver
platter
and
dashed
into
the
great
banquet
hall
one
pink
coat
tail
was
missing
and
his
wig
was
somewhat
elevated
over
the
left
ear
from
the
lump
raised
by
the
pewter
mug
but
he
summoned
what
dignity
he
could
and
joined
the
grand
procession
of
footmen
who
were
bearing
gold
and
silver
dishes
filled
with
goodies
for
the
birthday
feast
of
prince
pompadore
of
pumperdink
the
royal
guests
were
already
assembled
and
just
as
eejabo
entered
the
pages
blew
a
shrill
blast
upon
their
silver
trumpets
and
the
prime
pumper
stepped
forward
to
announce
their
majesties
oyez
oyez
shouted
the
prime
pumper
pounding
on
the
floor
with
his
silver
staff
while
the
guests
politely
inclined
their
heads
just
as
if
they
had
not
heard
the
same
announcement
dozens
of
times
before
oyez

the

pink
king
and

for

for
our
good
prince
pompadore
way
for
the
elegant
for
the
king
and
the
queen
and
the
prince
i
say
so
everybody
which
is
to
say
they
bowed
and
down
the
center
of
the
room
swept
pompus
very
fat
and
gorgeous
in
his
purple
robes
and
jeweled
crown
and
pozy
pink
very
stately
and
queenlike
in
her
ermine
cloak
and
prince
pompadore
very
straight
and
handsome
in
fact
they
looked
exactly
as
a
good
royal
family
should
illustration
pumperdink
but
kabumpo
who
swayed
along
grandly
after
the
royal
families
could
boast
of
so
royal
and
elegant
an
elephant
he
was
huge
and
gray
on
his
head
he
wore
jeweled
bands
and
a
jeweled
court
robe
billowed
out
majestically
as
he
walked
his
little
eyes
twinkled
merrily
and
his
big
ears
flapped
so
sociably
that
just
to
look
at
him
put
one
in
a
good
humor
kabumpo
was
the
only
elephant
in
pumperdink
or
in
any
kingdom
near
pumperdink
so
no
wonder
he
was
a
prime
favorite
at
court
he
had
been
given
to
the
king
at
pompa
s
christening
by
a
friendly
stranger
and
since
then
had
enjoyed
every
luxury
and
advantage
he
was
not
only
treated
as
a
member
of
the
royal
family
but
was
always
addressed
as
by
all
of
the
palace
servants
he
lends
an
air
of
elegance
to
our
court
the
king
was
fond
of
saying
and
the
elegant
elephant
he
surely
had
become
now
an
elegant
elephant
at
court
might
seem
strange
in
a
regular
country
but
pumperdink
is
not
at
all
regular
nor
up
to
date
it
is
a
cozy
kingdom
way
up
in
the
northern
part
of
the
gilliken
country
of
oz
enough
to
wear
knee
breeches
and
have
a
king
and
cozy
enough
to
still
enjoy
birthday
parties
and
candy
pulls
if
pompus
the
king
was
a
bit
proud
who
could
blame
him
his
queen
was
the
loveliest
his
son
the
most
charming
and
his
elephant
the
most
elegant
and
unusual
for
twenty
kingdoms
round
about
and
pompus
for
all
his
pride
had
a
very
simple
way
of
ruling
when
the
pumperdinkians
did
right
they
were
rewarded
when
they
did
wrong
they
were
dipped
in
the
very
center
of
the
courtyard
there
is
a
great
stone
well
with
a
huge
stone
bucket
into
this
pumperdink
well
all
offenders
and
law
breakers
were
lowered
its
waters
were
dark
blue
and
as
the
color
stuck
to
one
for
several
days
the
inhabitants
of
pumperdink
were
careful
to
behave
well
so
that
the
chief
dipper
who
turned
the
wheel
that
raised
and
lowered
the
bucket
often
had
days
at
a
time
with
nothing
to
do
this
time
he
spent
in
writing
poetry
and
as
prince
pompadore
took
the
place
of
honor
at
the
head
of
the
table
the
chief
dipper
rose
from
his
humble
place
at
the
foot
and
with
a
moist
flourish
burst
forth
oh
pompadore
of
pumperdink
of
all
perfection
you
re
the
pink
your
praises
now
i
utter
your
eyes
are
clear
as
apple
sauce
your
head
the
best
i
ve
come
across
your
heart
is
soft
as
very
good
said
the
king
and
the
chief
dipper
sat
down
blushing
with
pride
and
confusion
prince
pompadore
bowed
and
the
rest
of
the
party
clapped
tremendously
sounds
like
a
dipper
full
of
nonsense
to
me
wheezed
kabumpo
who
stood
directly
back
of
prince
pompadore
s
throne
leisurely
consuming
a
bale
of
hay
placed
on
the
floor
beside
him
it
may
surprise
you
to
know
that
all
the
animals
in
oz
can
talk
but
such
is
the
case
and
pumperdink
being
in
the
fairy
country
of
oz
kabumpo
could
talk
as
well
as
any
man
and
better
than
most
eyes
like
apple
of
butter
kerrumph
the
elegant
elephant
laughed
so
hard
he
shook
all
over
then
slyly
reaching
over
the
prime
pumper
s
shoulder
he
snatched
his
glass
of
pink
lemonade
and
emptied
it
down
his
great
throat
setting
the
tumbler
back
before
the
old
fellow
turned
his
head
did
you
call
sir
asked
eejabo
hurrying
over
he
had
mistaken
kabumpo
s
laugh
for
a
command
yes
why
did
you
not
give
his
excellency
lemonade
demanded
the
elegant
elephant
sternly
i
did
he
must
have
drunk
it
sir
stuttered
eejabo
drunk
it
cried
the
prime
pumper
pounding
on
the
table
indignantly
i
never
had
any
fetch
him
a
glass
at
once
rumbled
kabumpo
waving
his
trunk
and
eejabo
too
wise
to
argue
with
a
member
of
the
royal
family
brought
another
glass
of
lemonade
but
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
the
mischievous
elephant
stole
that
next
the
prime
pumper
s
plate
and
roll
and
all
so
quickly
no
one
but
prince
pompadore
knew
what
was
happening
and
poor
eejabo
was
kept
running
backwards
and
forwards
till
his
wig
stood
on
end
with
confusion
and
rage
all
of
this
was
very
amusing
to
the
prince
and
helped
him
to
listen
pleasantly
to
the
fifteen
long
birthday
speeches
addressed
to
him
by
members
of
the
royal
guard
but
if
the
speeches
were
dull
the
dinner
was
not
the
fiddlers
fiddled
so
merrily
and
the
chief
cook
hashem
had
so
outdone
himself
in
the
preparation
of
new
and
delicious
dainties
that
by
time
everyone
was
in
a
high
good
humor
the
cake
my
good
eejabo
fetch
forth
the
cake
commanded
king
pompus
beaming
fondly
upon
his
son
nervously
eejabo
stepped
to
the
side
table
and
lighted
the
eighteen
tall
birthday
candles
a
cake
that
had
disappeared
once
might
easily
do
so
again
and
eejabo
was
anxious
to
have
it
cut
and
out
of
the
of
way
at
least
hashem
looking
through
a
tiny
crack
in
the
door
almost
burst
with
pride
as
his
gorgeous
pink
masterpiece
was
set
down
before
the
prince
many
happy
returns
of
your
eighteenth
birthday
cried
the
courtiers
jumping
to
their
feet
and
waving
their
napkins
enthusiastically
thank
you
thank
you
chuckled
pompadore
bowing
low
i
feel
that
this
is
but
one
of
many
more
to
come
which
may
sound
strange
but
pumperdink
being
in
oz
one
may
have
as
many
eighteenth
birthdays
as
one
cares
to
have
this
was
pompa
s
tenth
and
while
the
courtiers
drank
his
health
the
prince
made
ready
to
blow
out
the
birthday
candles
that
s
right
blow
em
all
out
at
once
cried
the
king
so
pompa
puffed
out
his
cheeks
and
blew
with
all
his
might
but
not
a
candle
flickered
then
he
tried
again
indeed
he
puffed
and
blew
until
he
was
a
regular
royal
purple
but
nary
a
candle

so
much
as
wavered
stubbornest
candles
i
ever
saw
blustered

then
puffed
out
his
cheeks

blew
like
a
porpoise
so
did
queen
pozy
and
the
prime
pumper
so
did
everybody
they
blew
until
every
dish
upon
the
table
skipped
and
they
all
sank
back
exhausted
in
their
chairs
but
the
candles
burned
as
merrily
as
ever
then
kabumpo
took
a
rather
a
trunk
he
had
been
watching
the
proceedings
with
his
twinkling
little
eyes
now
he
took
a
tremendous
breath
pointed
his
trunk
straight
at
the
cake
and
blew
with
all
his
strength
illustration

every
candle
went
as
they
did
the
great
pink
cake
exploded
with
such
force
that
half
the
courtiers
were
flung
under
the
table
and
the
rest
knocked
unconscious
by
flying
fragments

from

shock

brushing
the

glared
around
angrily
the

the
cook

stood
trembling
in
the
doorway
him

furiously

only
too
glad

at

hopelessly
smeared
with

put
his

to
his
head
for
something
hard

struck
him
between

he
felt
about
the
floor
and
found
a
round
shiny
object
which
he
was
about
to
show
the

when
pompus
pounced
upon
a
tall
scroll
sitting
upright
in

tumbler
in
the
confusion

the
moment

escaped

opened
her
eyes
with

the

was
still
dazed
from
the
tremendous
explosion
pompus
read
the
scroll
to
himself
with
popping
eyes
and
then
began
to
dance
up
and
down
in
a
frenzy
what

trying

up

picking
a
proper
princess
what
shall
we
do
first
groaned
the
king
holding
his
head
with
both
hands
let
me
think
right
said
kabumpo
think
by
all
so
the
great
hall
was
cleared
and
the
king
with
the
mysterious
scroll
spread
out
before
him
thought
and
thought
and
but
he
did
not
make
much
headway
for
as
he
explained
over
and
over
to
queen
pozy
pompadore
the
elegant
elephant
and
the
prime
remained
to
help
him
how
is
one
to
know
where
to
find
the
proper
princess
and
how
is
one
to
know
the
proper
time
for
pompa
to
wed
her
who
was
how
did
the
scroll
get
in
the
cake
the
more
the
king
thought
about
these
questions
the
more
wrinkled
his
forehead
became
why
we
re
liable
to
wake
up
any
morning
and
find
ourselves
gone
he
announced
gloomily
how
does
it
feel
to
disappear
i
wonder
i
suppose
it
would
give
one
rather
a
gone
feeling
but
i
don
t
believe
it
would
volunteered
kabumpo
glancing
uneasily
over
his
shoulder
perhaps
not
but
it
would
not
get
us
anywhere
my
idea
is
to
marry
the
prince
at
once
to
a
proper
princess
put
in
the
prime
pumper
and
avoid
all
this
you
re
in
a
great
hurry
to
marry
me
off
aren
t
you
said
pompadore
sulkily
for
my
part
i
don
t
want
to
marry
at
all
well
that
s
very
selfish
of
you
pompa
said
the
king
in
a
grieved
voice
do
you
want
your
poor
old
father
to
disappear
not
only
your
poor
old
father
choked
the
prime
pumper
rolling
up
his
eyes
how
about
me
oh
can
disappear
any
time
you
want
said
the
prince
unfeelingly
it
all
started
with
that
wretched
cake
sighed
the
queen
i
am
positive
the
scroll
flew
out
of
the
cake
when
it
of
course
it
did
cried
pompus
let
us
send
for
the
cook
and
question
so
hashem
very
wet
and
blue
from
his
dip
was
brought
before
the
king
a
fine
cook
you
are
roared
pompus
mixing
gun
powder
and
scrolls
in
a
birthday
but
i
didn
t
wailed
hashem
falling
on
his
knees
only
eggs
your
best
flour
spice
bombshells
cried
the
king
angrily
the
cake
disappeared
the
party
your
majesty
cried
eejabo
everyone
jumped
at
the
sudden
interruption
and
eejabo
who
had
crept
in
unnoticed
stepped
before
the
throne
disappeared
continued
eejabo
hoarsely
dripping
blue
water
all
over
the
royal
rugs
one
minute
there
it
was
on
the
pantry
table
next
croaked
eejabo
flinging
up
his
hands
and
shrugging
his
shoulders
then
before
a
fellow
could
turn
around
it
was
back
tweren
t
our
fault
if
magic
got
mixed
into
it
and
here
we
have
been
dipped
for
nothing
well
why
didn
t
you
say
so
before
asked
the
king
in
exasperation
fine
chance
i
had
to
say
anything
sniffed
eejabo
wringing
out
his
lace
ruffles
may
have
the
day
off
my
good
man
said
pompus
with
an
apologetic
and
also
with
a
wave
at
hashem
very
stiffly
the
two
walked
to
the
door
it
s
an
off
day
for
us
all
right
said
eejabo
ungraciously
and
without
so
much
as
a
bow
the
two
disappeared
i
fear
you
were
a
bit
hasty
my
love
murmured
queen
pozy
looking
after
them
with
a
troubled
little
frown
well
who
wouldn
t
be
cried
pompus
ruffling
up
his
hair
here
we
are
liable
to
disappear
any
minute
and
all
you
do
is
to
stand
around
and
criticize
me
he
puffed
angrily
as
a
page
stuck
his
head
in
the
door
no
use
shouting
at
people
to
begone
said
the
elegant
elephant
testily
we
ll
all
begone
soon
at
this
queen
pozy
began
to
weep
into
her
silk
handkerchief
which
sight
so
affected
prince
pompadore
that
he
rushed
forward
and
embraced
her
tenderly
i
ll
marry
cried
the
prince
impulsively
i
ll
do
anything
the
trouble
is
there
aren
t
any
fairy
princesses
around
here
there
must
be
said
the
king
there
are
screamed
the
prime
pumper
bouncing
up
suddenly
oyez
oyez
has
your
majesty
forgotten
faleero
royal
princess
of
follensby
forest
why
of
course
the
king
snapped
his
fingers
joyfully
everyone
says
faleero
is
a
fairy
princess
she
must
be
the
proper
one
trumpeted
the
elegant
elephant
sitting
down
with
a
terrific
thud
that
awful
old
creature
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
silence
thundered
the
king
nonsense
trumpeted
kabumpo
she
s
a
thousand
years
old
and
as
ugly
as
a
stone
lukoogoo
don
t
you
marry
her
i
command
him
to
marry
her
cried
the
king
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
and
bending
forward
illustration
unlabelled
faleero
gasped
the
prince
scarcely
believing
his
ears
no
wonder
pompadore
was
shocked
faleero
although
a
princess
in
her
own
right
and
of
royal
fairy
descent
was
so
unattractive
that
in
all
her
thousand
years
of
life
no
one
had
wished
to
marry
her
she
lived
in
a
small
hut
in
the
great
forest
kingdom
next
to
pumperdink
and
did
nothing
all
day
but
gather
faggots
her
face
was
long
and
lean
her
hair
thin
and
black
and
her
nose
so
large
that
it
made
you
think
of
a
cauliflower
ugh
groaned
prince
pompadore
falling
back
on
kabumpo
for
support
well
she
s
a
princess
and
a
only
one
in
any
kingdom
i
don
t
see
why
you
want
to
be
so
fussy
said
the
king
fretfully
shall
i
tell
her
royal
highness
of
the
great
good
fortune
that
has
befallen
her
asked
the
prime
pumper
starting
for
the
door
do
so
at
once
snapped
pompus
just
then
he
gave
a
scream
of
fright
and
pain
for
a
round
shiny
object
had
flown
through
the
air
and
struck
him
on
the
head
what
was
that
the
prime
pumper
looked
suspiciously
at
the
elegant
elephant
kabumpo
glared
back
warning
stuttered
the
prime
pumper
afraid
to
say
that
kabumpo
had
flung
the
offending
missile
a
warning
your
majesty
it
s
nothing
of
the
kind
said
the
king
angrily
you
re
getting
old
pumper
and
stupid
it
it
s
a
door
knob
who
to
hit
me
with
a
door
knob
it
hit
me
once
mumbled
kabumpo
shifting
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
the
other
three
how
does
it
strike
you
as
an
outrageous
piece
of
impertinence
spluttered
pompus
turning
as
red
as
a
turkey
cock
perhaps
it
has
something
to
do
with
the
scroll
suggested
queen
pozy
taking
it
from
the
king
see
it
is
gold
and
all
the
door
knobs
in
the
palace
are
ivory
and
look
here
are
some
initials
sure
enough
it
was
gold
and
in
the
very
centre
were
the
initials
a
just
at
this
interesting
juncture
the
page
who
had
been
poking
his
head
in
the
door
every
few
minutes
gathered
his
courage
together
and
rushed
up
to
the
king
pardon
most
high
highness
but
general
quakes
bade
me
say
that
this
mirror
was
found
under
the
window
stuttered
the
page
and
before
pompus
had
an
opportunity
to
cry
begone
or
dip
him
the
little
fellow
made
a
dash
for
the
door
and
disappeared
it
grows
more
puzzling
every
minute
wailed
the
king
looking
from
the
door
knob
to
the
mirror
and
from
the
mirror
to
the
scroll
if
you
take
my
advice
you
ll
have
this
marriage
performed
at
once
said
the
prime
pumper
in
a
trembling
voice
i
believe
i
will
sighed
pompus
rubbing
the
bump
on
his
head
go
and
fetch
the
princess
faleero
and
you
pompa
prepare
for
your
but
father
began
the
prince
not
another
word
or
you

the
king
of
pumperdink
i
m
not
going
to
have
my
kingdom
disappearing
if
i
can
help
it
you
mean
if
can
help
it
muttered
pompadore
gloomily
this
is
ridiculous
stormed
the
elegant
elephant
as
the
prime
pumper
rushed
importantly
out
of
the
room
don
t
you
know
that
this
country
of
ours
is
only
a
small
part
of
the
great
kingdom
of
oz
there
must
be
hundreds
of
princesses
for
pompadore
to
choose
from
why
should
he
not
wed
ozma
the
princess
of
us
all
haven

you
read
any

you
never

himself
i
will
carry
her

all
it

a
long
way
to

but
yes
and
what
is
to
become
of
us
in
the
meantime
pray
while
you
are
wandering
all
over

the
proper
princess
and
pompadore
shall

her
said
pompus
you
re
talking
through
your
crown
wheezed
kabumpo
how
about
the
door
knob
and
mirror
they
came
out
of
the
cake
as
well
as
the
scroll
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
them
let
s
have
a
look
at
that
just
a
common
gold
mirror
fumed
pompus
holding
it
up
for
the
elegant
elephant
to
see
what
s
the
matter
as
kabumpo
gave
a
snort
on
the
face
of
the
mirror
as
kabumpo
looked
in
two
words
appeared
elegant
elephant
and
when
pompus
snatched
the
mirror
above
his
reflection
stood
the
words
fat
old
king
then
queen

peeped
into
the
mirror
which
promptly
flashed
lovely
queen
why
it
s
telling
the
truth
screamed
pompa
looking
over
his
mother
s
shoulder
at
this
the
words
charming
prince
formed
quickly
in
the
glass
the
prince
grinned
at
his
father
who
was
now
quite
beside
himself
with
rage
you
think
i
m
fat
and
old
do
you
snorted
the
king
flinging
the
gold
mirror
face
down
on
the
table
this
is
a
nice
day
i
must
say
scrolls
door
knobs
mirrors
and
insults
but
what
can
stand
for
mused
queen
pozy
thoughtfully
plain
enough
chuckled
kabumpo
maliciously
it
stands
for
perfectly
awful
who
s
perfectly
awful
asked
pompus
suspiciously
why
faleero
sniffed
the
elegant
elephant
that
s
plain
enough
to
everybody
dip
him
shrieked
pompus
i
ve
had
enough
of
this
you
hear
that
yawned
kabumpo
straightening
his
silk
robe
is
impossible
and
considering
his
size
it
was
but
just
that
minute
the
prime
pumper
returned
and
in
his
interest
to
hear
what
the
princess
faleero
had
said
the
king
forgot
about
dipping
kabumpo
the
courier
from

forward

all
the

accepts
prince
pompadore
with
pleasure
and
will
marry
him

gave
a
dismal
groan
fine
cried
the
king
rubbing
his
hands
together
let
everything
be
made
ready
for
the
ceremony
and
in
the
meantime
glared
about
i
forbid
anyone

disappearing
i
am
still
the
king
set
a
guard
around
the
castle
pumper
to
watch
for
any
signs
of
disappearance
and
if
so
much
as
a
fence
paling
disappears
drew
himself
notify
me
then
turning
to
the
throne
pompus
gave
his
arm
to
queen
pozy
and
together
they
started
for
the
garden
do
you
mean
to
say
you
are
going
to
pay
no
attention
to
the
mirror
or

kabumpo

himself
in

sadly
he

into

royal
gardens
the

the

elephant
unhappily
then
all
at

up

darkly

furiously
my
pearls
and
my
purple
plush
robe

them
at
once
he
puffed
when
his
personal
attendant
appeared
in
the
doorway
yes
sir
are
you
going
out
sir
murmured
the
little
pumperdinkian
hastening
to
a
great
chest
in
the
corner
of
the
big
marble
room
to
get
out
of
the
robe
not
unless
disappearing
is
going
out
said
kabumpo
more
mildly
for
he
was
quite
fond
of
this
little
man
who
waited
on
him
but
i
m
liable
to
disappear
any
minute
so
are
you
so
is
everybody
and
i
for
my
part
wish
to
do
the
thing
well
and
disappear
with
as
much
elegance
as
possible
have
you
heard
about

mounting
a

to

pearls
and
gorgeous

yes

and
my
head
s
going
round
and
round
like
what
asked
kabumpo
looking
approvingly
at
his
reflection
in
the
long
mirror
i
can

rightly

gulped

then
taking
out
a
bright
red
handkerchief
he
blew
his
nose
violently
and
rushed
out
of
the
room
kabumpo
walked
up
and
down
before
the
mirror
surveying
himself
from
all
angles
a
very
gorgeous
appearance
he
presented
in
his
purple
plush
robe
of
state
all
embroidered
in
silver
and
his
head
bands
of
shining
pearls
in
the
left
side

there
was
a
deep
pocket
into

the

slipped
all
the
jewels
he
possessed
taking
them
from
a
drawer
in

gold
door

he
rumbled
thoughtfully
and
the
noiselessly
for
all
his
tremendous
size
kabumpo
could
move
without
a
sound
he
made
his
way
back
to
the
banquet
hall
and
loomed
up
suddenly
behind
the
prime
pumper
the
old
fellow
was
staring
with
popping
eyes
into
the
gold
mirror

roared
kabumpo

above
the
shocked
reflection

the
foolish
statesman

the

what
stuttered
the

the

down
on
the
table
in
a
hurry
where
d
you
come
from
what
are
you

to
himself
illustration

that
was
an
anxious
afternoon
and
evening
in

minutes
the
courtiers
felt
themselves
nervously
to
see
if
they
were
still
there
the
servants
went
about
on
looking
fearfully
over
their
shoulders
for
the
first
signs
of
disappearance
as
it
grew
darker
the
gates
and
windows
were
securely
barred
and
not
a
candle
was
lighted
the
less
the
castle
shows
the
less
likely
it
is
to
disappear
reasoned
the
king
the
darkness
suited
kabumpo
he
waited
until
everyone
in
the
palace
had
retired
and
a
full
hour
longer
then
he
stepped
softly
down
the
passage
to
the
prince
s
apartment
pompadore
without
undressing
had
flung
himself
upon
a
couch
and
fallen
into
an
uneasy
slumber
without
making
a
sound
kabumpo
took
the
prince
s
crown
from
a
dressing
cabinet
slipped
it
carefully
into
the
pocket
of
his
robe
and
then
carefully
lifted
the
sleeping
prince
in
his
curling
trunk
and
started
cautiously
down
the
great
hall
setting
him
gently
on
the
floor
as
he
reached
the
palace
doors
he
pushed
back
the
golden
bolts
and
stepped
out
into
the
garden
the
voices
of
the
watchmen
calling
to
each
other
from
the
great
wall
came
faintly
through
the
darkness
but
the
elegant
elephant
hurried
to
a
secret
unguarded
entrance
known
only
to
himself
and
pompadore
and
passed
like
a
great
shadow
through
the
swinging
gates
once
outside
he
swung
the
sleeping
prince
to
his
broad
back
and
ran
swiftly
and
silently
through
the
night
what
are
we
doing
murmured
the
prince
drowsily
in
his
sleep

stirred
uneasily
and

again
giving
his

a
fretful
thump
ouch
this
time
his
eyes
flew
wide
open
for
his
knuckles
were
tingling
with
pain
a
rock
gasped
the
prince
sitting
up
indignantly
a
rock
under
my
head
no
wonder
it
aches
great
gillikens
where
am
i
he
stared
about
wildly
there
was
not
a
familiar
object
in
sight
indeed
he
was
in
a
dim
deep
forest
and
from
the
distance
came
the
sound
of
someone
sawing
wood
oh
oh
i
know
muttered
the
prince
rubbing
his
head
miserably
it
s
that
wretched
scroll
i
ve
disappeared
and
this
is
the
place
i
ve
disappeared
stiffly
he
got
to
his
feet
and
started
to
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
sawing
but
had
only
gone
a
few
steps
before
he
gave
a
cry
of
joy
for
there
leaning
up
against
a
tree
snoring
like
twenty
at
work
was
kabumpo
wake
up
cried
pompadore
pounding
him
with
all
his
might
wake
up
kabumpo
we
ve
disappeared
have
we
yawned
the
elegant
elephant
opening
one
eye
you
don
t
say
hah
hoh
hum
with
a
tremendous
yawn
he
opened
the
other
eye
and
began
to
chuckle
and
shake
all
over
we
stole
a
march
on
em
pompa
i
d
like
to
see
the
king
s
face
when
he
finds
us
gone
old
pumper
will
be
oyezing
all
over
the
palace
he
ll
think
we
ve
disappeared
by
well
didn
t
we
asked
pompadore
in
amazement
not
unless
you
call
magic
i
carried
you
off
in
the
night
did
you
suppose
old
kabumpo
was
going
to
stand
quietly
by
while
they
married
you
to
a
faggotty
old
fairy
like
faleero
not
much
wheezed
the
elegant
elephant
i
have
other
plans
for
you
little
one
but
this
is
terrible
cried
the
prince
catching
hold
of
a
tree
here
you
have
left
my
poor
old
father
my
lovely
mother
and
the
whole
kingdom
of
pumperdink
to
disappear
we
ll
have
to
go
right
straight
straight
back
to
pumperdink
do
you
hear
do
have
a
little
sense
kabumpo
shook
himself
crossly
you
can
t
save
them
by
going
back
the
thing
to
do
is
to
go
forward
find
the
proper
princess
and
marry
her
no
scroll
magic
takes
effect
for
seven
days
anyway
how
do
you
know
asked
pompa
anxiously
read
it
in
a
witch
book
answered
kabumpo
promptly
now
that
gives
us
plenty
of
time
to
go
to
the
emerald
city
and
present
ourselves
to
the
lovely
ruler
of
oz
there
s
a
proper
princess
for
you
pompa
but
suppose
she
refuses
me
said
the
prince
uncertainly
you
re
very
handsome
pompa
my
the
elegant
elephant
gave
the
prince
a
playful
poke
with
his
trunk
i
ve
brought
all
my
jewels
as
gifts
and
the
magic
mirror
and
door
knob
as
well
if
she
refuses
you
and
the
worst
comes
to
the
worst
cleared
his
throat
leave
it
to
me
after
a
bit
more
coaxing
and
after
eating
the
breakfast
kabumpo
had
thoughtfully
brought
along
pompa
allowed
the
elegant
elephant
to
lift
him
on
his
head
and
off
they
set
at
kabumpo
s
best
speed
for
the
emerald
city
of
oz
neither
the
prince
nor
the
elegant
elephant
had
ever
been
out
of
pumperdink
but
kabumpo
had
found
an
old
map
of
oz
in
the
palace
library
according
to
this
map
the
emerald
city
lay
directly
to
the
south
of
their
own
country
so
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
keep
going
south
chuckled
kabumpo
softly
pompadore
nodded
but
he
was
trying
to
recall
the
exact
words
of
the
mysterious
scroll
know
ye
that
unless
ye
prince
of
ye
ancient
and
honorable
kingdom
of
pumperdink
shall
wed
ye
proper
fairy
princess
in
ye
proper
span
of
time
ye
kingdom
of
pumperdink
shall
disappear
forever
and
even
longer
from
ye
gilliken
country
of
oz
pompadore
repeated
the
words
solemnly
then
fell
of
all
he
had
heard
of
ozma
of
oz
the
loveliest
little
fairy
imaginable
she
wouldn
t
want
one
of
her
kingdom
to
disappear
reflected
pompadore
sagely
now
as
it
happened
ozma
did
not
even
know
of
the
existence
of
pumperdink
oz
is
so
large
and
inhabited
by
so
many
strange
and
singular
peoples
that
although
fourteen
books
of
history
have
been
written
about
it
only
half
the
story
has
been
told
there
are
no
oz
railway
or
steamship
lines
and
traveling
is
tedious
and
slow
owing
to
the
magic
nature
of
the
land
itself
its
many
mountains
and
fairy
forests
so
that
pumperdink
like
many
of
the
small
kingdoms
on
the
outskirts
of
oz
has
never
been
explored
by
ozma
oz
itself
is
a
huge
oblong
country
divided
into
four
parts
the
north
being
the
purple
gilliken
country
the
east
the
blue
munchkin
country
the
south
the
red
lands
of
the
quadlings
and
the
west
the
pleasant
yellow
country
of
the
winkies
in
the
very
center
of
oz
as
almost
every
boy
and
girl
knows
is
the
wonderful
emerald
city
and
in
its
gorgeous
green
palace
lives
ozma
the
lovely
little
fairy
princess
whom
kabumpo
wanted
pompadore
to
marry
do
you
know
mused
the
prince
after
they
had
traveled
some
time
through
the
dim
forest
i
believe
that
gold
mirror
has
a
lot
to
do
with
all
this
i
believe
it
was
put
in
the
cake
to
help
me
find
the
proper
where
would
you
find
a
more
proper
princess
than
ozma
puffed
kabumpo
indignantly
ozma
is
the
upon
it
just
the
same
said
pompa
firmly
i
m
going
to
try
every
princess
we
meet
do
you
expect
to
find
em
running
wild
in
the
woods
snorted
kabumpo
who
didn
t
like
to
be
contradicted
you
never
can
the
prince
of
pumperdink
settled
back
comfortably
now
that
they
were
really
started
he
was
finding
traveling
extremely
interesting
i
should
have
done
this
long
ago
murmured
the
prince
to
himself
every
prince
should
go
on
a
journey
of
how
long
will
it
take
us
to
reach
the
emerald
city
he
asked
presently
two
days
if
nothing
happens
answered
kabumpo
s
that
he
stopped
short
and
spread
his
ears
till
they
looked
like
sails
the
underbrush
at
the
right
was
crackling
from
the
springs
of
some
large
animal
and
next
minute
a
hoarse
voice
roared
i
want
to
know
the
which
and
what
the
where
and
how
and
why
a
curious
luxurious
old
cottabus
am
i
i
want
to
know
the
when
and
who
the
whatfor
and
whyso
sir
so
please
attend
there
is
no
end
to
things
i
want
to
know
sir
aha
exulted
the
voice
triumphantly
there
you
are
and
a
great
round
head
was
thrust
out
almost
in
kabumpo
s
face
oh
i
m
going
to
enjoy
this
don
t
move
kabumpo
was
too
astonished
to
move
and
the
next
instant
the
cottabus
had
flounced
out
of
the
bushes
and
settled
itself
directly
in
front
of
the
two
travelers
it
was
large
as
a
pony
but
shaped
like
a
great
overfed
cat
its
eyes
bulged
unpleasantly
and
the
end
of
its
tail
ended
in
a
large
fan
illustration
the
cottabus
was
as
large
as
a
pony
but
shaped
like
a
great
overfed
cat
well
grunted
kabumpo
after
the
strange
creature
had
regarded
them
for
a
full
minute
without
blinking
well
what
it
asked
beginning
to
fan
itself
sulkily
you
act
as
if
you
had
never
seen
a
cottabus
we
never
have
admitted
pompa
peering
over
kabumpo
s
head
and
secretly
wishing
he
had
brought
along
his
jeweled
sword
why
haven
t
you
asked
the
cottabus
rolling
up
its
eyes
how
frightfully
ignorant
it
closed
its
fan
tail
with
a
snap
and
looked
up
at
them
disapprovingly
will
you
kindly
tell
me
who
you
are
where
you
came
from
when
you
came
what
you
are
going
for
how
you
are
going
to
get
it
why
you
are
going
and
what
you
are
going
to
do
when
you
do
get
it
i
don
t
see
why
we
should
tell
you
all
that
grumbled
kabumpo
none
of
your
wrong
shrieked
the
creature
hysterically
it
is
the
business
of
a
cottabus
to
find
out
everything
i
live
on
other
people
s
affairs
and
unless
it
paused
took
a
large
handkerchief
out
of
a
pocket
in
its
fur
and
began
to
wipe
its
unless
a
cottabus
asks
fifty
questions
a
day
it
curls
up
in
its
porch
rocker
and
and
this
is
my
fifth
questionless
curl
up
and
die
then
said
kabumpo
gruffly
but
the
prince
felt
sorry
for
the
foolish
creature
if
we
answer
your
questions
will
you
answer
ours
i
ll
try
sniffed
the
curious
cottabus
and
leaning
over
it
dragged
a
rocking
chair
out
of
the
bushes
and
seated
itself
comfortably
well
then
began
pompa
this
is
the
elegant
elephant
and
i
am
a
prince
we
came
from
pumperdink
because
our
kingdom
was
threatened
with
disappearance
unless
i
marry
a
proper
illustration
unlabelled
yes
murmured
the
cottabus
rocking
violently
yes
yes
and
we
are
going
to
the
emerald
city
to
ask
princess
ozma
for
her
hand
continued
the
prince
how
do
you
know
she
is
the
one
when
did
this
happen
who
brought
the
message
what
are
you
going
to
do
if
ozma
refuses
you
asked
the
cottabus
leaning
forward
breathlessly
are
you
going
to
stand
talking
to
this
ridiculous
creature
all
day
grumbled
kabumpo
but
pompadore
perhaps
because
he
was
so
young
felt
flattered
that
even
a
curious
old
cottabus
should
take
such
an
interest
in
his
affairs
so
beginning
at
the
very
beginning
he
told
the
whole
story
of
his
birthday
party
yes
yes
gulped
the
cottabus
wildly
each
time
the
prince
paused
for
breath
yes
yes
fluttering
its
fan
excitedly
when
pompadore
had
finished
the
cottabus
leaned
back
closed
its
eyes
and
put
both
paws
on
the
arms
of
the
rocker
i
never
heard
anything
more
curious
in
my
life
said
the
curious
one
this
will
keep
me
amused
for
three
days
of
s
what
we
re
here
amuse
you
said
kabumpo
scornfully
let
be
going
pompa
perhaps
the
curious
cottabus
can
tell
us
something
of
the
country
ahead
are
there
any
princesses
living
round
here
the
prince
asked
eagerly
never
heard
of
any
said
the
cottabus
opening
its
eyes
can
you
and
subtract
are
you
good
at
fractions
prince
not
very
admitted
pompadore
looking
mystified
then
you
won
t
make
much
headway
sighed
the
cottabus
shaking
its
head
solemnly
now
don
t
ask
me
why
it
added
lugubriously
dragging
its
rocker
back
into
the
brush
and
while
kabumpo
and
pompa
stared
in
amazement
it
wriggled
away
into
the
bushes
come
on
cried
kabumpo
with
a
contemptuous
grunt
but
he
had
only
gone
a
few
steps
when
the
curious
cottabus
stuck
its
head
out
of
an
opening
in
the
trees
just
ahead
when
are
you
coming
back
it
asked
twitching
its
nose
anxiously
never
trumpeted
kabumpo
increasing
his
speed
again
the
cottabus
disappeared
only
to
reappear
at
the
first
turn
in
the
road
did
you
say
the
door
knob
hit
you
on
the
head
it
asked
pleadingly
kabumpo
gave
a
snort
of
anger
and
rushed
along
so
fast
that
pompa
had
to
hang
on
for
dear
life
guess
we
ve
left
him
behind
this
time
spluttered
the
elegant
elephant
after
he
had
run
almost
a
mile
but
at
that
minute
there
was
a
wheeze
from
the
underbrush
and
the
head
of
the
cottabus
was
thrust
out
its
tongue
was
hanging
out
and
it
was
panting
with
exhaustion
how
old
are
you
it
gasped
rolling
its
eyes
pitifully
who
was
your
grandfather
on
your
father
s
side
and
was
he
bald
kerumberty
bumpus
raged
the
elegant
elephant
flouncing
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
but
why
was
the
door
knob
in
the
cake
gulped
the
cottabus
two
tears
trickling
off
its
nose
how
should
we
know
said
pompa
coldly
then
just
tell
me
the
date
of
your
birth
wailed
the
cottabus
two
tears
trickling
off
its
nose
no
no
screamed
kabumpo
and
this
time
he
ran
so
fast
that
the
tearful
voice
of
the
cottabus
became
fainter
and
fainter
and
finally
died
away
altogether
provokingest
creature
i
ve
ever
met
grumbled
the
elegant
elephant
and
this
time
pompa
agreed
with
him
isn
t
it
almost
lunch
time
asked
the
prince
he
was
beginning
to
feel
terribly
hungry
and
aren
t
there
any
villages
or
cities
between
here
and
the
emerald
city
pompa
spoke
again
don
t
know
wheezed
kabumpo
swinging
ahead
oh
there
s
a
flag
cried
pompa
suddenly
it
s
flying
above
the
tree
tops
just
and
so
it
huge
flapping
black
flag
covered
with
hundreds
of
figures
and
signs
hurry
up
kabumpo
urged
the
prince
this
looks
illustration
unlabelled
chapter
in
the
city
of
the
figure
heads
it
reminds
me
of
something
disagreeable
answered
kabumpo
as
he
eyed
the
flag
nevertheless
he
quickened
his
steps
and
in
a
moment
they
came
to
a
clearing
in
the
forest
surrounded
by
a
tall
black
picket
fence
the
only
thing
visible
above
the
fence
was
the
strange
black
flag
and
as
the
forest
on
either
side
was
too
dense
to
penetrate
and
there
seemed
to
be
no
way
around
kabumpo
thumped
loudly
on
the
center
gate
it
was
flung
open
at
once
so
suddenly
that
kabumpo
who
had
his
head
pressed
against
the
bars
fell
on
his
knees
and
shot
pompadore
clear
over
his
head
altogether
it
was
a
very
undignified
entrance
oh
oh
now
we
shall
have
some
fun
screamed
a
high
thin
voice
and
immediately
the
cry
was
taken
up
by
hundreds
of
other
voices
a
perfect
swarm
of
strange
creatures
surrounded
the
two
travelers
the
elegant
elephant
took
one
look
put
back
his
ears
and
snatched
pompa
from
the
paving
stones
stop
that
he
rumbled
threateningly
who
are
you
anyway
the
crowd
paid
no
attention
to
the
elegant
elephant
s
question
but
continued
to
dance
up
and
down
and
scream
with
glee
clutching
kabumpo
s
ear
pompa
peered
down
with
many
misgivings
they
were
entirely
surrounded
by
thin
spry
little
people
who
had
figures
instead
of
heads
and
the
fours
eights
sevens
and
ciphers
bobbing
up
and
down
made
it
terribly
confusing
let
s
go
said
pompa
who
was
growing
dizzier
every
minute
but
the
figure
heads
were
wedged
so
closely
around
them
kabumpo
could
not
move
and
they
were
shouting
so
lustily
that
the
elegant
elephant
s
voice
was
drowned
in
the
hubbub
finally
kabumpo
s
eyes
began
to
snap
angrily
and
taking
a
deep
breath
he
threw
up
his
trunk
and
trumpeted
like
fifty
whistles
the
effect
was
immediate
and
astonishing
half
of
the
figure
heads
fell
on
their
faces
and
the
other
half
fell
on
their
backs
and
stared
vacantly
up
at
the
sky
conduct
us
to
your
ruler
roared
kabumpo
in
the
dead
silence
that
followed
how
d
you
know
we
had
a
ruler
asked
a
seven
getting
cautiously
to
its
feet

no
right
to

us
around
said
a
six
sitting
up
and
jerking
its
thumb
at
kabumpo
seven
frowned
at
six
and
put
his
hands
over
his
ears
this
way
he
said
gruffly
and
kabumpo
stepping
carefully
for
many
of
the
figure
heads
were
still
on
their
backs
followed
seven
if
the
inhabitants
of
this
strange
city
were
queer
their
city
was
even
more
so
the
air
was
dry
and
choky
and
the
houses
were
dull
oblong
affairs
set
in
rows
and
rows
with
never
a
garden
in
sight
each
street
had
a
large
signpost
on
the
corner
but
they
were
not
like
the
signs
one
usually
sees
in
cities
for
these

there

kabumpo
as

into

at

anything

they

me
of

the

seven
looking
back
scornfully
but
kabumpo
was
too
interested
to
care
out
of
the
windows
of

leaped
hundreds
of
the

they
laughed

pompadore
ducking
just
in

as
a
four
snatched
at
his
hair
from
an
open
window
but
just
then
they
turned
a
corner
and
entered
a
large
gloomy
court
sitting
on
a
square
and
solid
wood
throne
surrounded
by
a
guard
of

the

the

i

and
this
is
the
prince
of
pumperdink
announced
kabumpo
before
seven
could
answer
pompadore
himself
could
say
nothing
for
he
had
never
before
been
addressed
by
a
wooden
ruler
in
his
life
and
that
is
exactly
what
the

of

twice

the

asked

somewhat
cast
down

the

your

said
a
tall
thin
individual
standing
next
to
the
ruler
he
eyed
the
two
cunningly
if
a
thin
prince
sets
out
on
a
fat
elephant
to
find
a
proper
princess
how
many
yards
of
fringe
will
the
elephant
lose
from
his
robe
and
how
bald
will
the
prince
be
at
the
end
of
the
journey
i
don
t
believe
anyone
could
figure
that
out
he
murmured
gleefully
it
might
be
done
by

said
the
king
looking
at
the
two
critically
great
hay
stacks
rumbled
kabumpo
glaring
over

the

looked

the
ruler
waving
his
hand
the
count
will
take
you
in

and
so
dazed
was
the
elegant
elephant
by
all
this
strange
reasoning
that
he
tamely

upon

so
on

said

it
up

pushed
back
his
pearl
headdress
and
drops
of
perspiration
began
to
run
down
his
trunk
prince
pompa
lying
flat
on
kabumpo
s
head
started
to
add
up
the
first
line
of
figures

announced
anxiously

three
and
eight
to
carry

up

out
of

landed

down
at

swung
his
trunk
carelessly
while
he
waited
for
his
next
victim
so
slowly

painfully
pompa
counted
up
the
long
lines
and
kabumpo
carried
and
if
they
made
the
slightest
mistake
the
figure
heads
shouted
with
scorn
and
danced
about
till
the
confusion
was
terrible
when
an
example
was
finished
the
figure
heads
in
it
marched
away
but
another
would
immediately
form
lines
ahead
so
that
it
took
them
a
whole
hour
to
go
two
blocks

slowly
and
painfully
pompa
counted
up
the
long
lines

groaned
pompa
at

we

never

through
this
kabumpo
look
at
those
awful
fractions
ahead
can
t
i
skip
fractions
he
asked
looking
pleadingly
at
count
it
up
certainly
not
said
the
pencilly
man
stroking
his
shiny
hair
which
was
straight
and
black
and
grew
up
into
a
sharp
point
you
shall
skip
nothing
that
gives
me
an
idea
whispered
kabumpo
huskily
why
shouldn
t
we
skip
altogether
we
re
bigger
than
they
are
how
are
you
getting
on
at
the
sound
of
that
hoarse
familiar
voice
both
the
prince
and
kabumpo
jumped
you
don
t
mind
me
asking
i
hope
clinging
to
the
high
picket
fence
and
looking
anxiously
through
the
bars
was
the
curious
cottabus
have
you
found
the
greatest
common
divisor
yet
who
s
he
asked
the
elegant
elephant
suspiciously
isn
t
there
any
way
out
of
rith
metic
but
this
wailed
pompa
looking
at
the
cottabus
pleadingly
he
was
too
tired
to
mind
being
questioned
the
curious
beast
was
delighted
to
have
this
new
opportunity
to
talk
to
the
travelers
will
you
answer
a
few
questions
if
i
tell
you
asked
the
cottabus
raising
itself
with
great
difficulty
and
looking
over
the
palings
promised
pompa
do
you
care
for
strawberry
tarts
asked
the
cottabus
twitching
its
nose
very
rapidly
of
course
said
the
prince
oh
do
hurry
count
it
up
will
be
back
in
a
moment
he
had
run
ahead
to
arrange
a
new
problem
and
the
rest
of
the
figure
heads
paid
no
attention
to
the
queer
creature
clinging
to
the
palings
are
you
going
to
invite
the
scarecrow
to
your
wedding
gulped
the
cottabus
i
don
t
know
any
scarecrow
said
pompa
so
how
could
i
are
you
fond
of
that
old
elephant
the
cottabus
waved
at
kabumpo
who
stamped
first
one
foot
then
another
and
fairly
snorted
with
rage
all
right
sighed
the
curious
cottabus
that
makes
my
fifty
hanging
on
to
the
fence
with
one
paw
it
waved
the
other
backward
and
forward
as
it
chanted
how
many
tics
in
rith
metic
tell
me
that
and
tell
me
quick
but
if
you
can
t
it
s
not
my
fault
so
simply
turn
a
wintersault
the
head
of
the
cottabus
disappeared
now
isn
t
that
provoking
gulped
the
prince
after
it
promised
to
help
us
too
i
meant
summersault
wheezed
the
cottabus
reappearing
and
if
you
can
t
it
s
not
your
fault
so
simply
turn
a
summersault
it
recited
dolefully
and
losing
its
balance
fell
off
the
fence
and
landed
with
a
thud
on
the
ground
below
here
hurry
along
scolded
count
it
up
prodding
kabumpo
with
a
sharp
pencil
the
next
is
a
nice
little
problem
in
i
wonder
if
it
meant
anything
mused
pompadore
as
kabumpo
approached
the
new
problem
if
you
can
t
its
not
your
fault
so
simply
turn
a
anyway
it
wouldn
t
hurt
to
try
stop
a
minute
kabumpo
sliding
down
the
elegant
elephant
s
trunk
the
prince
put
his
head
on
the
ground
and
very
carefully
and
deliberately
turned
a
somersault
at
his
first
motion
count
it
up
gave
a
deafening
scream
fell
on
his
head
and
broke
off
his
point
while
the
figure
heads
began
to
run
in
every
direction

do
it
again

cried
kabumpo
joyfully
so
pompa
turned
another
somersault
and
another
and
another
and
till
not
a
figure
head
was
in
sight
even
the
figure
heads
at
the
windows
of
the
houses
tumbled
out
and
dashed
madly
around
the
corner
before
they
could
return
kabumpo
snatched
up
pompa
and
tore
through
the
deserted
streets
of
rith
metic
till
he
came
to
the
black
iron
gate
at
the
other
end
of
the
city
butting
it
open
with
his
head
the
elegant
elephant
dashed
through
and
never
stopped
running
till
he
was
miles
away
from
there
have
to
rest
a
bit
and
eat
some
leaves
puffed
kabumpo
at
last
slowing
down
wish
i
could
eat
leaves
sighed
the
prince
as
kabumpo
began
lunching
off
the
tree
tops
but
never
mind
we
re
out
of
rith
metic
wasn
t
it
lucky
that
cottabus
followed
us
i
never
would
have
thought
of
getting
out
of
sums
by
somersaulting
would
you
only
sensible
thing
it
ever
said
probably
answered
the
elegant
elephant
with
his
mouth
full
of
leaves
there
s
a
lot
more
to
be
learned
by
traveling
than
by
studying
my
boy
somersaults
for
s
always
remember
that
pompa
did
not
answer
he
slid
down
kabumpo
s
trunk
and
began
hunting
anxiously
around
for
something
to
eat
not
far
away
he
found
a
large
nut
tree
and
gathering
a
handful
of
nuts
he
sat
down
and
began
to
crack
them
on
a
white
marble
slab
near
by
next
instant
kabumpo
heard
a
thud
and
a
muffled
cry
the
prince
of
pumperdink
had
vanished
as
if
by
magic
where
are
you
screamed
the
elegant
elephant
pounding
through
the
brush
pompa
pompa
he
s
disappeared
gasped
kabumpo
rushing
over
to
the
marble
slab
there
was
not
a
sign
of
the
royal
prince
of
pumperdink
anywhere
but
carved
carefully
on
the
white
stone
were

in
six
rocks
on
the
same
night
that
prince
pompa
and
kabumpo
had
disappeared
from
pumperdink
a
little
gray
gnome
crouched
in
a
deep
chamber
tunneled
under
the
emerald
city
laboriously
carving
letters
on
a
big
rock
it
was
ruggedo
the
old
gnome
king
carving
and
grumbling
and
grumbling
and
carving
and
pausing
every
few
minutes
to
light
his
pipe
with
a
hot
coal
which
he
kept
in
his
pocket
for
that
purpose
a
big
emerald
lamp
cast
a
green
glow
over
the
strange
cavern
and
made
the
gnome
look
like
a
bad
green
goblin
which
he
was
wag
screamed
the
gnome
suddenly
throwing
down
his
chisel
where
are
you
you
villain
there
was
a
slight
stir
at
the
back
of
the
cave
and
a
rabbit
of
about
the
same
size
as
the
gnome
shuffled
slowly
forward
what
you
want
he
asked
rubbing
one
eye
with
his
paw
bring
me
a
cup
of
melted
mud
idiot
roared
the
gnome
pounding
on
the
rock
and
serve
it
to
me
on
my
throne
at
once
now
see
here
the
rabbit
twitched
his
nose
rapidly
i
ll
get
you
a
cup
of
melted
mud
but
don
t
you
call
me
an
idiot
i
don
t
mind
working
for
one
nor
digging
for
one
and
listening
to
his
foolishness
but
nobody
can
call
me
an
even
a
king
oh
you
make
me
tired
fumed
the
gnome
then
go
to
sleep
advised
the
rabbit
with
a
yawn
what
s
the
use
of
trying
to
pretend
you
re
a
king
rug
ho
ho
king
over
one
wooden
doll
six
rocks
and
sofa
cushions
you
may
have
been
a
king
once
but
now
you
re
just
a
plain
gnome
and
nothing
else
and
if
you
go
and
sit
quietly
in
your
plain
rocking
chair
i
ll
bring
you
a
cup
of
plain
with
a
chuckle
the
rabbit
retired
and
ruggedo
spluttering
with
fury
flounced
into
a
doll
s
broken
rocker
that
was
set
in
the
exact
center
of
the
cave
here
i
give
that
rabbit
everything
i
steal
and
he
won
t
even
allow
me
the
little
luxury
of
calling
him
an
idiot
or
of
pulling
his
ears
how
can
i
pretend
to
be
a
king
without
an
ear
to
pull
grumbled
the
gnome
what
are
you
grinning
at
bouncing
out
of
his
chair
ruggedo
flew
at
a
wooden
doll
who
sat
propped
up
against
the
wall
and
shook
her
till
her
head
turned
round
backwards
and
her
arms
and
legs
flew
every
which
way
then
he
hurled
her
violently
into
a
corner
quite
out
of
breath
he
sank
back
in
his
chair
and
stared
angrily
about
when
wag
returned
the
gnome
snatched
the
tin
cup
of
melted
mud
and
tossed
it
down
with
one
gulp
then
flinging
the
cup
at
the
doll
he
went
back
to
work
the
rabbit
shook
his
head
mournfully
and
picking
up
the
wooden
doll
straightened
her
out
and
placed
her
on
a
cushion
then
yawning
again
he
lit
a
candle
and
started
for
the
passage
at
the
back
of
the
cave
how
are
you
getting
on
he
asked
pausing
to
look
over
the
gnome
s
shoulder
with
a
grin
fine
answered
ruggedo
forgetting
to
scowl
i
m
up
to
the
sixth
rock

expect
to
finish
who
do
you
think
will
read
it
asked
the
rabbit
putting
back
both
ears
and
stroking
his
whiskers
then
he
gave
a
great
spring
just
escaped
the
chisel
ruggedo
had
flung
at
his
head
and
pattered
away
into
the
darkness
for
several
minutes
the
gnome
danced
up
and
down
with
fury
then
as
there
was
no
one
to
pinch
or
shake
he
started
to
work
harder
than
ever
on
the
sixth
rock
of
his
history
there
were
six
of
the
great
stones
set
in
a
row
on
one
side
of
the
cavern
and
the
carving
on
them
had
taken
the
old
gnome
king
the
best
part
of
two
years
the
letters
were
crooked
and
roughly
chiseled
but
quite
readable
on
the
first
rock
he
had
carved
history
of
ruggedo
in
six
rocks
ruggedo
the
of
the
gnomes
one
time
metal
monarch
at
other
times
a
limoneag
a
goose
a
nut
and
now
a
common
gnome
by
order
of
of
the
second
rock
told
of
ruggedo
s
magnificent
kingdom
under
the
mountains
of
ev
of
the
thousands
of
gnomes
he
had
ruled
and
the
great
treasure
of
precious
gems
he
had
possessed
in
those
good
old
days
before
he
was
banished
from
his
dominions
the
third
rock
told
of
his
transformation
of
the
queen
of
ev
and
her
children
into
ornaments
for
his
palace
and
of
their
rescue
by
a
party
from
oz
through
the
cleverness
of
billina
a
yellow
hen
it
told
of
the
loss
of
his
magic
belt
which
was
captured
at
this
same
time
by
dorothy
a
little
girl
from
kansas
the
fourth
rock
related
how
ruggedo
had
tried
to
conquer
oz
and
recover
his
belt
how
all
of
his
plans
failed
and
how
he
tumbled
into
the
fountain
of
oblivion
and
forgot
all
about
his
campaign
the
fifth
rock
had
taken
ruggedo
the
longest
to
carve
for
it
gave
the
story
of
his
banishment
by
the
great
jinn
titihoochoo
you
have
probably
read
this
story
yourself
how
tik
tok
betsy
bobbin
shaggyman
and
polychrome
trying
to
find
shaggy
s
brother
hidden
in
the
gnome
king
s
metal
forest
were
thrown
down
a
long
tube
to
the
other
side
of
the
world
and
how
the
owner
of
the
tube
sent
quox
the
dragon
to
punish
ruggedo
by
banishment
from
his
kingdom
and
how
kaliko
was
made
king
of
the
gnomes
the
sixth
rock
told
of
ruggedo
s
last
attempt
to
capture
oz
meeting
kiki
aru
a
highup
boy
who
knew
a
magic
transformation
word
ruggedo
suggested
that
they
change
themselves
to
beasts
with
lion
heads
monkey
tails
and
eagle
all
the
beasts
of
oz
to
help
and
march
on
the
emerald
city
but
this
plan
failed
too
kiki
lost
his
temper
and
changed
ruggedo
to
a
goose
the
wizard
of
oz
discovered
the
magic
word
and
changed
both
the
conspirators
to
nuts
later
on
they
were
changed
back
to
their
normal
shapes
but
again
ruggedo
was
plunged
into
the
fountain
of
oblivion
and
again
forgot
his
wicked
plans
this
ended
the
rock
history
except
for
a
short
sentence
stating
that
ruggedo
now
lived
in
the
emerald
city
but
the
magic
of
the
fountain
of
oblivion
had
soon
worn
off
and
it
was
not
long
before
ruggedo
began
to
remember
his
past
wickedness
that
is
why
he
decided
to
carve
his
life
story
in
rock
so
that
it
would
be
handy
should
he
ever
fall
into
the
forgetful
fountain
again
and
it
had
taken
six
rocks
to
tell
all
of
his
adventures
he
had
not
carved
these
stories
just
as
they
had
happened
nor
ever
called
himself
wicked
but
he
had
told
most
of
the
facts
leaving
out
the
parts
most
unflattering
to
himself
and
now
it
was
whole
history
in
six
rocks
throwing
down
his
chisel
for
the
last
time
ruggedo
straightened
up
and
regarded
his
work
with
glowing
pride
i
don
t
believe
there
s
another
history
like
this
in
all
oz
puffed
the
gnome
tugging
at
his
silver
beard
illustration
unlabelled
it
s
a
good
thing
chuckled
wag
who
had
come
back
to
eat
a
carrot
oz
would
not
be
a
very
happy
place
if
there
were
many
folks
like
he
seated
himself
quietly
on
the
first
rock
of
ruggedo
s
history
and
began
nibbling
his
carrot
get
up
how
dare
you
sit
on
my
history
ruggedo
stamped
his
foot
and
started
threateningly
toward
wag
all
right
said
the
rabbit
it
s
too
hard
of
course
it
s
hard
stormed
ruggedo
i
ve
had
a
hard
life
hard
as
those
rocks
everybody
s
been
against
me
from
the
very
start
and
all
because
i
m
so
little
he
finished
bitterly
no
because
you
are
so
wicked
said
the
rabbit
calmly
now
don
t
throw
your
pipe
at
me
for
you
know
it
s
the
ruggedo
glared
at
the
rabbit
for
a
minute
then
rushed
over
to
the
wooden
doll
and
began
shaking
her
furiously
he
always
vented
his
rage
on
the
wooden
doll
stop
that
screamed
wag
or
i
ll
leave
upon
the
spot
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
you
old
she
s
not
alive
snapped
ruggedo
sulkily
how
do
you
know
retorted
the
rabbit
anyway
she
s
a
jolly
creature
i
m
not
going
to
have
her
banged
around
here
you
ve
taken
her
away
from
her
little
mother
and
she
hasn
t
even
anyone
to
rock
her
to
i
ll
rock
her
to
sleep
screamed
ruggedo
maliciously
and
flinging
the
doll
on
the
floor
he
began
hurling
small
rocks
at
the
helpless
little
figure
scrambling
to
his
feet
wag
rescued
the
wooden
doll
again
and
ruggedo
who
really
was
afraid
the
rabbit
would
leave
him
subsided
into
his
rocking
chair
then
reaching
up
to
a
small
shelf
over
his
head
he
pulled
down
an
accordion
at
the
first
doleful
wheeze
wag
gave
a
great
hop
dropped
peg
and
disappeared
into
his
room
in
the
farthest
corner
of
the
cave
illustration
unlabelled
after
his
last
attempt
to
capture
oz
the
gnome
had
been
given
a
small
cottage
to
live
in
just
outside
the
emerald
city
but
ruggedo
could
not
bear
life
above
ground
the
sunlight
hurt
his
eyes
and
the
contented
happy
faces
of
the
people
hurt
his
feelings
for
he
was
exactly
what
wag
had
called
old
so
while
he
pretended
to
live
in
the
little
cottage
according
to
ozma
s
orders
he
really
spent
most
of
his
time
in
this
deep
dark
cave
he
entered
it
by
a
secret
passage
opening
from
his
cellar
digging
the
long
passage
had
been
the
hardest
work
ruggedo
had
ever
done
in
his
bad
little
life
while
toiling
one
day
he
had
bumped
into
the
underground
burrow
of
wag
a
wandering
rabbit
of
oz
and
after
a
deal
of
bargaining
the
rabbit
had
agreed
to
help
him
wag
was
to
receive
a
ruby
a
month
for
his
services
for
the
gnome
still
had
a
large
bag
of
precious
stones
which
he
had
brought
from
the
old
kingdom
after
the
bargain
with
wag
was
made
the
passage
progressed
rapidly
for
the
rabbit
was
an
expert
digger
it
was
ruggedo
s
idea
to
tunnel
himself
out
a
secret
chamber
directly
under
ozma
s
palace
and
there
establish
a
kingdom
of
his
own
but
when
they
had
almost
reached
the
spot
the
earth
began
to
crumble
away
and
a
few
strokes
of
ruggedo
s
spade
revealed
a
great
dark
cavern
already
tunneled
by
someone
else
it
was
huge
and
the
exact
shape
of
the
royal
palace
this
ruggedo
discovered
by
careful
measurement
and
also
that
it
was
directly
beneath
the
gorgeous
green
edifice
so
that
the
footsteps
of
the
servants
could
be
heard
faintly
pattering
to
and
fro
this
dark
underground
retreat
suited
the
former
gnome
king
exactly
and
without
stopping
to
wonder
to
whom
it
had
belonged
ruggedo
gleefully
took
possession
for
almost
two
years
he
had
lived
here
without
anyone
suspecting
it
but
so
far
his
kingdom
had
not
progressed
very
well
wag
had
tried
to
coax
some
of
his
rabbit
relations
to
serve
the
old
gnome
as
subjects
but
ruggedo
besides
his
terrible
temper
had
a
mean
habit
of
pulling
their
ears
so
that
the
whole
crew
had
deserted
the
first
week
he
had
pulled
wag
s
ears
once
but
the
rabbit
tore
out
a
pawful
of
his
whiskers
and
bit
him
so
severely
in
the
leg
that
ruggedo
had
never
dared
to
try
it
again
wag
had
stayed
partly
because
ruggedo
amused
him
and
partly
because
of
the
bribes
for
every
day
in
fear
of
losing
his
only
retainer
ruggedo
brought
wag
something
from
the
emerald
he
had
stolen
in
return
wag
waited
on
the
bad
little
gnome
and
listened
to
his
grumblings
against
everybody
in
oz
all
the
furnishings
of
this
strange
cave
had
been
stolen
from
various
houses
in
the
emerald
city
the
brocade
cushions
had
been
taken
one
at
a
time
from
the
palace
the
green
emerald
lamp
also
every
day
ruggedo
ran
innocently
about
the
city
pretending
to
visit
this
one
and
that
and
every
day
cups
spoons
and
candlesticks
disappeared
the
doll
s
rocker
which
ruggedo
insisted
upon
calling
his
throne
had
been
taken
from
betsy
bobbin
a
little
girl
who
lived
with
ozma
in
the
palace
he
had
lugged
it
through
the
secret
passage
with
great
difficulty
the
wooden
doll
had
been
stolen
from
trot
another
of
ozma
s
companions
she
was
trot
s
favorite
doll
for
she
had
been
carved
out
of
wood
by
captain
bill
an
old
sailor
who
was
one
of
the
most
celebrated
characters
in
all
oz
he
had
carved
her
for
trot
one
day
when
they
were
on
a
picnic
in
the
winkie
country
from
the
wood
of
a
small
yellow
tree
and
as
captain
bill
had
notions
peg
was
a
very
doll
but
she
had
splendid
joints
and
could
sit
down
and
stand
up
her
face
was
painted
and
as
pleasant
as
laughing
blue
eyes
a
nose
and
a
smiling
mouth
could
make
it
trot
had
dressed
her
in
a
funny
dress
with
pantalettes
and
then
thinking
peg
too
short
a
name
the
little
girl
had
added
amy
because
she
was
so
amiable
she
confided
laughingly
to
the
old
sailor
captain
bill
had
wagged
his
head
understandingly
and
peg
amy
had
straightway
become
the
most
popular
doll
in
the
palace
that
is
until
she
disappeared
for
ruggedo
had
found
her
one
day
in
the
garden
and
chuckling
wickedly
had
carried
her
off
to
his
cave
how
trot
would
have
felt
if
she
had
seen
her
poor
doll
being
shaken
and
scolded
by
the
old
gnome
king
but
trot
never
knew
she
hunted
and
hunted
for
her
doll
and
finally
gave
up
in
despair
fortunately
peg
was
well
made
or
she
would
have
been
shaken
to
bits
but
her
joints
held
bravely
and
even
the
terrible
scolding
of
the
bad
old
change
her
pleasant
expression
being
the
sole
subject
of
so
wicked
a
king
however
was
wearing
even
for
a
wooden
doll
and
peg
was
beginning
to
show
signs
of
wear
her
nose
was
badly
chipped
one
pantalette
was
missing
and
both
sleeves
had
been
jerked
from
her
dress
by
the
furious
old
gnome
if
the
rabbit
was
around
ruggedo
did
not
shake
peg
as
hard
as
he
wanted
to
but
when
the
rabbit
was
gone
he
pretended
she
was
his
old
steward
kaliko
and
scolded
and
flung
her
about
to
his
heart
s
content
illustration
ruggedo
scolded
and
flung
peg
about
furiously
when
not
carving
his
history
or
shaking
peg
ruggedo
had
spent
most
of
his
time
digging
new
tunnels
and
chambers
so
that
leading
off
from
the
main
cavern
was
a
perfect
network
of
underground
passages
in
the
back
of
ruggedo
s
head
was
a
notion
that
some
day
he
would
conquer
the
emerald
city
regain
his
magic
powers
and
then
after
changing
all
the
inhabitants
to
mouldy
muffins
return
to
his
dominions
and
oust
kaliko
from
his
throne
just
how
this
was
to
be
done
he
had
not
decided
but
the
secret
passages
would
be
useful
so
meanwhile
he
dug
secret
passages
above
ground
the
little
rascal
went
about
so
meekly
and
pretended
to
be
so
delighted
with
his
life
among
the
inhabitants
of
the
emerald
city
that
ozma
really
thought
he
had
reformed
wag
to
whom
he
confided
his
plans
would
shake
his
head
gloomily
and
often
planned
to
leave
the
services
of
the
wicked
old
gnome
there
was
no
real
harm
in
wag
but
the
rabbit
had
a
weakness
for
collecting
and
the
spoons
cups
and
odds
and
ends
that
ruggedo
brought
him
from
the
emerald
city
filled
him
with
delight
he
felt
that
they
were
not
gotten
honestly
but
his
work
for
ruggedo
was
honest
and
hard
and
it
s
not
my
fault
if
the
old
steals
em
wag
would
mumble
to
himself
in
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
was
doing
wrong
to
stay
with
ruggedo
but
like
all
foolish
creatures
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
so
this
very
night
while
the
old
gnome
sat
playing
the
accordion
and
howling
doleful
snatches
of
the
gnome
national
air
wag
was
gloating
over
his
treasures
they
quite
filled
his
little
room
there
were
two
emerald
plates
a
gold
pencil
a
dozen
china
cups
and
saucers
twenty
thimbles
stolen
from
the
work
baskets
of
the
good
dames
of
oz
scraps
of
silk
pictures
and
almost
everything
you
could
imagine
i
ll
soon
have
enough
to
marry
and
go
to
on
murmured
the
rabbit
clasping
his
paws
and
twitching
his
nose
very
fast
he
picked
up
a
pair
of
purple
wool
socks
that
had
once
belonged
to
a
little
girl
s
doll
and
regarded
them
rapturously
out
of
all
the
articles
ruggedo
had
given
him
wag
considered
these
purple
socks
the
most
valuable
perhaps
because
they
exactly
fitted
him
and
were
the
only
things
he
could
really
use
the
squeaking
of
the
accordion
stopped
at
last
and
supposing
his
wicked
little
master
had
retired
for
the
night
wag
prepared
to
enjoy
himself
draping
a
green
silk
scarf
over
his
shoulders
he
strutted
before
the
mirror
pretending
he
was
a
courtier
of
oz
then
throwing
down
the
scarf
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
had
just
drawn
on
one
of
the
socks
when
a
loud
shrill
scream
from
ruggedo
made
his
ears
stand
straight
on
end
in
amazement
what
now
coughed
the
rabbit
seizing
the
candle
ruggedo
was
on
his
knees
before
the
rocking
chair
as
i
was
sitting
here
playing
and
singing
spluttered
the
old
gnome
i
noticed
a
little
ring
in
one
of
the
rocks
on
the
floor

well
what
of
it
sniffed
wag
leaning
down
to

up
his

what

it
shrieked
the
gnome
what

it

poor
puny
earth

leaning
over
ruggedo
s
shoulder
and
dropping
hot
candle

down
the

wag
peered
into
a
square
opening
in
the
floor
there
lay
a
small
gold
box
studded
in
gems
on
the
lid

these

ruggedo
said
nothing
but
his
little
red
eyes
blazed
maliciously
reaching
down
he
lifted
out
the
box
and
clasping
it
to
his
fat
little
stomach
shook
his
fist
at
the
high
domed
ceiling
of

he
strode
up

down
the
room
his
armor
clanking
at
every
step
straightway
the
company
began
to
tell
about
wild
giants
they
had
read

known

betsy
bobbin
held

as
they
sat
together

crept
closer
to
his

the

on

rising
higher
as
each
story
was
finished
giant
stories
are
all
very
well
but
why
tell

at
night
shivered
toto
peering
nervously
at
the
long
shadows
in
the
corners
of
the
room
it
was
the
evening
after
ruggedo
s
strange
discovery
of
the
mixed
magic
and
in
the
royal
palace
ozma
and
most
of
the
courtiers
had
retired
but
a
few
of
princess
dorothy
s
special
friends
had
gathered
in
the
cozy
of
her
apartment
to
talk
about
old
times
they
were
very
unusual
and
interesting
friends
not
at
all
the
sort
one
would
expect
to
find
in
a
royal
palace
even
in
fairyland
dorothy
herself
before
she
had
become
a
princess
of
oz
had
been
a
little
girl
from
kansas
but
after
several
visits
to
this
delightful
country
she
had
preferred
to
make
oz
her
home
trot
and
betsy
bobbin
also
had
come
from
the
united
states
by
way
of
shipwrecks
so
to
speak
and
had
been
invited
to
remain
by
ozma
the
little
fairy
princess
who
ruled
oz
and
now
each
of
these
girls
had
a
cozy
little
apartment
in
the
royal
palace

had
come
with
dorothy
but
the
rest
of
the
company
were
of
more
or
less
magic
extraction
the
scarecrow
a
stuffed
straw
person
with
a
marvelous
set
of
mixed
brains
given
to
him
by
the
wizard

dorothy

favorite
in

she
had
discovered
him
herself
upon
a
munchkin
farm
lifted
him
down
from
his
bean
pole
and
brought
him
to
the
emerald
city
tik
tok
was
a
wonderful
man
made
entirely
of
copper

could
talk

well
as
the

when
properly

you
would
have
been
amazed
to
hear
the

minute

just

her
head
was
full
of
nonsense
rhymes
and
she
was
so
amusing
and
cheerful
that

upon
her
living

was
a
comparative

yet
the
knight
was
so
old
that
it
would
give
me
lumbago
just
to
try
to
count
up
his
birthdays
he
dated
back
to

arthur

had
been
wished
into

rumbles

still
the

concluded

be
finished
by

but
it
never

at

there
was
a

the

tried
to
reassure
the

company
he
told
them
there
was
no

for

that
they
would
soon
find

dorothy

she
subsided
as

and

thumping

had

no

dorothy

the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
finished
his
breakfast
slowly
combed
his
beard
pinned
on
all
of
his
medals
and
solemnly
issued
forth
from
his
little
house
at
the
garden
gates
forward
march
snapped
the
soldier
he
had
to
give
himself
orders
being
the
only
man
general
or
private
in
the
army
and
forward
march
he
did
it
was
his
custom
to
report
to
ozma
every
morning
to
receive
his
orders
for
the
day
when
he
had
gone
through
the
little
patch
of
trees
that
separated
his
cottage
from
the
palace
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
gave
a
great
leap
halt
break
ranks
roared
the
grand
army
of
oz
clutching
his
beard
in
terror
great
goloshes
he
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
again
yes
the
gorgeous
palace
had
disappeared
leaving
not
so
much
as
a
gold
brick
to
tell
where
it
had
stood
trembling
in
every
knee
the
grand
army
of
oz
approached
a
great
black
hole
the
exact
shape
of
the
palace
yawned
at
his
feet
he
took
one
look
down
that
awful
cavity
then
shot
through
the
palace
gardens
like
a
green
comet
like
paul
revere
he
had
gone
to
give
the
alarm
and
paul
revere
himself
never
made
better
time
he
thumped
on
windows
and
banged
on
doors
and
dashed
through
the
sleeping
city
like
a
whirlwind
in
five
minutes
there
was
not
a
man
woman
or
child
who
did
not
know
of
the
terrible
calamity
they
rushed
to
the
palace
gardens
in
a
panic
some
stared
up
in
the
air
others
peered
down
the
dark
hole
still
others
ran
about
wildly
trying
to
discover
some
trace
of
the
missing
castle
what
shall
we
do
they
wailed
dismally
for
to
have
their
lovely
little
queen
and
the
wizard
and
all
the
most
important
people
in
oz
disappear
at
once
was
simply
terrifying
they
were
a
gentle
and
kindly
folk
used
to
obeying
orders
and
now
there
was
no
one
to
tell
them
what
to
do
at
last
unk
nunkie
an
old
munchkin
who
had
taken
up
residence
in
the
emerald
city
pushed
through
the
crowd
unk
was
a
man
of
few
words
but
a
wise
old
chap
for
all
that
so
they
made
way
for
him
respectfully
first
unk
nunkie
stroked
his
beard
then
pointing
with
his
long
lean
finger
toward
the
south
he
snapped
out
one
glinda
of
course
they
must
tell
glinda
why
had
they
not
thought
of
it
themselves
glinda
would
know
just
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
three
cheers
for
unk
nunkie
glinda
you
know
is
the
good
sorceress
of
oz
who
knows
more
magic
than
anyone
in
the
kingdom
but
who
only
practices
it
for
the
people
s
good
indeed
glinda
and
the
wizard
of
oz
are
the
only
ones
permitted
to
practice
magic
for
so
much
harm
had
come
of
it
that
ozma
made
a
law
forbidding
sorcery
in
all
of
its
branches
but
even
in
a
fairy
country
people
do
not
always
obey
the
laws
and
everyone
felt
that
magic
was
at
the
bottom
of
this
disaster
so
away
to
fetch
glinda
dashed
the
grand
army
his
green
whiskers
streaming
behind
him
fortunately
the
royal
stables
had
not
disappeared
with
the
palace
so
the
gallant
army
sprang
upon
the
back
of
the
saw
horse
and
without
stopping
to
explain
to
the
other
royal
beasts
bade
it
carry
him
to
glinda
as
fast
as
it
could
gallop
being
made
of
wood
with
gold
shod
feet
and
magically
brought
to
life
the
saw
horse
can
run
faster
than
any
animal
in
oz
it
never
tired
or
needed
food
and
when
it
understood
that
the
palace
and
its
dear
little
mistress
had
disappeared
it
fairly
flew
for
the
saw
horse
loved
ozma
with
all
its
saw
dust
and
was
devoted
as
only
a
wooden
beast
can
be
illustration
the
grand
army
sprang
upon
the
back
of
the
saw
horse
in
an
hour
they
had
reached
glinda
s
shining
marble
palace
in
the
southern
part
of
the
quadling
country
and
as
soon
as
the
lovely
sorceress
had
heard
the
soldier
s
story
she
hurried
to
the
magic
book
of
records
this
is
the
most
valuable
book
in
oz
and
it
is
kept
padlocked
with
many
golden
chains
to
a
gold
table
for
in
this
great
volume
appear
all
the
events
happening
in
and
out
of
the
world
now
glinda
had
been
so
occupied
trying
to
discover
the
cause
of
frowns
that
she
had
not
referred
to
the
book
for
several
days
and
naturally
there
were
many
pages
to
go
over
there
were
hundreds
of
entries
concerning
automobile
accidents
in
the
united
states
and
elsewhere
these
glinda
passed
over
hurriedly
till
she
came
to
three
sentences
printed
in
red
for
oz
news
always
appeared
in
the
book
in
red
letters
the
first
sentence
did
not
seem
important
it
merely
stated
that
the
prince
of
pumperdink
was
journeying
toward
the
emerald
city
the
other
two
entries
seemed
serious

the
third
glinda
pored
over
the
book
for
a
long
time
to
see
whether
any
more
information
would
be
given
but
not
another
red
sentence
appeared
with
a
sigh
glinda
turned
to
the
soldier

the
green
whiskers

ruggedo

something
on
his
mind

glinda
the
old
gnome
king
must
be
mixed
up
in
this
she
said
anxiously
and
as
he
was
last
seen
in
the
emerald
city
i
will
return
with
you
at
so
glinda
and
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
flew
back
to
the
emerald
city
drawn
in
glinda
s
chariot
by
swift
flying
swans
and
the
little
saw
horse
trotted
back
by
himself
when
they
reached
the
gardens
a
great
crowd
had
gathered
by
the
fountain
of
oblivion
and
a
tall
green
grocer
was
speaking
excitedly
what
is
it
asked
glinda
shuddering
as
she
passed
the
dreadful
hole
where
ozma
s
lovely
palace
had
once
stood
everyone
started
explaining
at
once
so
that
glinda
was
obliged
to
clap
her
hands
for
silence
foot
print
unk
nunkie
stood
upon
his
tip
toes
and
whispered
it
in
glinda
s
ear
and
when
she
looked
where
unk
pointed
she
saw
a
huge
shallow
that
crushed
the
flower
beds
for
as
far
as
she
could
see
foot

gasped
glinda
in
amazement
uh
huh
unk
nunkie
wagged
his
head
determinedly
and
then
pulling
his
hat
down
over
his
eyes
spoke
his
last
word
on
the
subject
a
giant
foot
print
why
so
it
is
cried
glinda
what
shall
we
do
what
shall
we
do
cried
the
frightened
inhabitants
of
the
emerald
city
wringing
their
hands
first
find
ruggedo
ordered
glinda
suddenly
remembering
the
mysterious
entry
in
the
book
of
records
so
away
to
the
little
cottage
hurried
the
crowd
they
searched
it
from
cellar
to
garret
but
of
course
found
no
trace
of
the
wicked
little
gnome
as
no
one
knew
about
the
secret
passage
in
ruggedo
s
cellar
they
never
thought
of
searching
underground
meanwhile
glinda
sank
down
on
one
of
the
golden
garden
benches
and
tried
to
think
the
comfortable
camel
stumbled
across
the
lawn
and
dropping
on
its
knees
begged
the
sorceress
in
a
tearful
voice
to
save
sir
hokus
of
pokes
the
camel
and
the
doubtful
dromedary
had
been
discovered
by
the
knight
on
his
last
adventure
and
were
deeply
attached
to
him
soon
all
the
palace
pets
came
and
stood
in
a
dejected
row
before
s
mule
hank
dismally
and
the
hungry
tiger
threatening
to
eat
everyone
in
sight
if
any
harm
came
to
the
three
little
girls
i
doubt
if
we
ll
ever
see
them
again
groaned
the
doubtful
dromedary
leaning
up
against
a
tree
oh
you
wailed
the
camel
tears
streaming
down
its
nose
please
do
be
quiet
begged
glinda
or
i
ll
forget
all
the
magic
i
know
let
me
see
does
one
catch
a
marauding
giant
who
has
run
off
with
a
castle
on
her
fingers
glinda
counted
up
all
the
giants
in
the
four
countries
of
oz
no
it
could
not
be
an
oz
giant
there
was
none
large
enough
it
must
be
a

from
some
strange
country
when
the
crowd
returned
with
the
news
that
ruggedo
had
disappeared
glinda
felt
more
uneasy
still
but
hiding
her
anxiety
she
bade
the
people
return
to
their
homes
and
continue
their
work
and
play
as
usual
then
promising
to
return
that
evening
with
a
plan
to
save
the
castle
and
charging
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
to
keep
a
strict
watch
in
the
garden
glinda
stepped
into
her
chariot
and
flew
back
to
the
south
all
that
day
in
her
palace
in
the
quadling
country
glinda
bent
over
her
encyclopedia
on
giants
and
far
into
the
night
the
lights
burned
from
her
high
as
she
consulted

mixed
magic
makes
mischief
the
book
of
records
had
been
perfectly
correct
in
stating
that
ruggedo
had
something
on
his
mind
had
to
understand
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
ozma
s
palace
we
must
go
back
to
the
old
of
the
gnomes
the
whole
of
the
night
after
he
had
found
glegg
s
box
of
mixed
magic
ruggedo
had
spent
trying
to
open
the
box
but
pry
and
poke
as
he
would
it
stubbornly
refused
to
give
up
its
secrets
better
come
to

advised
wag
twitching
his
nose
nervously
mixed

you

grumbled
ruggedo
i
don

know
who
glegg
is
or

but
i

going
to
find
out
what
kind
of
magic
he
mixes
i
m
going
to
open
this
box
if
it
takes
me
a

quavered
wag
retiring
backward
and
holding
up
his
paw
all
right
but
remember
i
warned
you
don
t
meddle
with
magic
that
s
my
motto
i
don
t
care
a
harebell
what
your
motto
is
sneered
the
gnome
continuing
to
hammer
on
the
gold
lid
when
he
reached
his
room
wag
shut
the
door
and
sank
dejectedly
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
there
s
no
manner
of
use
trying
to
stop
him
sighed
the
rabbit
so
i
ve
got
to
get
out
of
here
before
he
gets
me
into
trouble
i
ll
go
resolved
wag
pulling
his
long
ear
nervously
with
this
good
resolution
the
little
rabbit
drooped
off
asleep
very
cautiously
he
opened
the
door
of
his
little
next
morning
ruggedo
was
sound
asleep
on
the
floor
his
head
on
the
magic
box
and
peg
amy
with
her
wooden
arms
and
legs
flung
out
in
every
direction
lay
sprawled
in
a
corner
been
shaking
you
again
the
old
whispered
the
rabbit
indignantly
just
cause
he
couldn
t
open
that
box
well
never
mind
peg
i
m
leaving
and
as
surely
as
i
ve
ears
and
whiskers
you
shall
go
too
picking
up
the
poor
wooden
doll
wag
tucked
her
under
his
arm
was
it
imagination
or
did
the
little
wooden
face
break
into
a
sunny
smile
it
seemed
so
to
wag
and
with
a
real
thrill
of
pleasure
he
back
to
his
room
and
began
tossing
his
treasures
into
one
of
the
bed
sheets
he
seated
peg
in
his
own
small
rocking
chair
and
from
time
to
time
he
nodded
to
her
reassuringly
we
ll
soon
be
out
now
my
dear
he
chuckled
quite
as
if
peg
had
been
alive
she
often
did
seem
alive
to
wag
then
we
ll
see
what
ozma
has
to
say
to
this
mixed
magic
continued
the
bunny
wiggling
his
ears
indignantly
and
so
occupied
was
he
collecting
his
treasures
that
he
did
not
hear
ruggedo
s
call
and
next
minute
the
angry
gnome
himself
stood
in
the
doorway
what
does
this
mean
he
cried
furiously
pointing
to
the
tied
up
sheet
then
he
stamped
his
foot
so
hard
that
peg
amy
fell
over
sideways
in
the
chair
and
all
the
ornaments
in
the
room
skipped
as
if
alive
the
rabbit
whirled
round
in
a
hurry
it
means
i
m
leaving
you
for
good
you
wicked
little
monster
shrilled
wag
his
whiskers
trembling
with
agitation
and
his
ears
sticking
straight
out
behind
you
hear
then
he
snatched
peg
amy
in
one
paw
and
his
treasures
in
the
other
and
tried
to
brush
past
ruggedo
but
the
gnome
was
too
quick
for
him
springing
out
of
the
room
he
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
wag
could
hear
him
rolling
up
rocks
for
further
security
thought
you
d
steal
a
march
on
old
ruggedo
thought
you
d
tell
ozma
all
his
plans
and
get
a
nice
little
reward
well
shouted
the
gnome
through
the
keyhole
wag
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
for
ruggedo
never
came
near
the
rabbit
s
room
all
day
at
every
sound
poor
wag
leaped
into
the
air
for
he
felt
sure
each
blow
could
only
mean
the
opening
of
the
dreaded
magic
box
to
reassure
himself
he
held
long
conversations
with
the
wooden
doll
and
peg
s
calm
cheerfulness
steadied
him
a
lot
i
might
dig
my
way
out
but
it
would
take
so
long
my
ear
tips
how
provoking
it
is
exclaimed
wag
but
perhaps
he
ll
relent
by
nightfall
slowly
the
day
dragged
on
but
nothing
came
from
the
big
rock
room
but
thumps
grumbles
and
bangs
illustration
unlabelled
it
is
fortunate
that
you
do
not
eat
peg
dear
sighed
the
rabbit
late
in
the
afternoon
nibbling
disconsolately
on
a
stale
biscuit
he
had
found
under
his
bureau
shall
you
care
very
much
if
i
starve
i
probably
shall
you
know
of
course
no
one
in
oz
can
die
but
starving
forever
is
not
comfortable
at
this
the
wooden
doll
seemed
to
shake
her
head
as
much
as
to
say
you
won
t
starve
wag
dear
just
be
patient
a
little
not
that
she
really
said
this
mind
you
but
wag
knew
from
her
smile
that
this
is
what
she
was
thinking
it
was
hot
and
stuffy
in
the
little
rock
chamber
and
the
faint
light
that
filtered
down
from
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
was
far
from
cheerful
at
last
night
came
and
that
was
worse
wag
lit
his
only
candle
but
it
was
already
partly
burned
down
and
soon
with
a
dismal
sputter
it
went
out
and
left
the
two
sitting
in
the
dark
peg
amy
stared
cheerfully
ahead
but
the
rabbit
worn
out
by
his
long
day
of
fright
and
worry
fell
into
a
heavy
slumber
meanwhile
ruggedo
had
worked
on
the
magic
box
and
every
minute
he
became
more
impatient
all
his
poundings
failed
to
make
even
a
dent
on
the
gold
lid
and
even
jumping
on
it
brought
no
result
the
little
gnome
had
eaten
nothing
since
morning
and
by
nightfall
he
was
stamping
around
the
box
in
a
perfect
fury
his
eyes
snapped
and
twinkled
like
live
coals
and
his
wispy
white
hair
fairly
crackled
with
rage
hidden
in
this
box
were
magic
secrets
that
would
doubtless
enable
him
to
capture
the
whole
of
oz
but
how
was
he
to
get
at
em
he
finally
gave
the
gold
box
such
a
vindictive
kick
that
he
almost
crushed
his
curly
toes
then
holding
onto
one
foot
he
hopped
about
on
the
other
till
he
fell
over
exhausted
for
several
minutes
he
lay
perfectly
still
then
jumping
up
he
seized
the
box
and
flung
it
with
all
his
gnome
might
against
the
rock
wall
take
that
screamed
ruggedo
furiously
there
was
a
bright
flash
then
the
box
righted
itself
slowly
and
sailed
straight
back
into
ruggedo
s
hands
and
more
wonderful
still
was
with
his
eyes
almost
popping
from
his
head
the
gnome
sat
down
on
the
floor
the
box
in
his
lap
illustration

in
the

were

rubbed
his

lifted
out
the

in
the
next
compartment
was
a
tiny
copper
kettle
a
lamp
and
a
package
marked

so
anxious
was
ruggedo
to
know
what
was
in
the
last
compartment
that
he
scarcely
glanced
at
glegg
s
tea
set
quickly
he
peered
into
the
bottom
of
the
casket
there
were
two
boxes
taking
up
the
first
ruggedo
read
glegg
s
question
box

three
times
after
each
great
grampus
spluttered
the
gnome
this
is
a
find
he
was
growing
more
excited
every
minute
and
his
hands
shook
so
he
could
hardly
read
the
label
on
the
last
box
finally
he
made
it
out
rays
guaranteed
to
reawaken
any
person
who
has
lost
the
power
of
life
through
sorcery
witchcraft
or
enchantment

well
did
anyone
ever
hear
anything
more
magic
than
that
ruggedo
glanced
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
little
gold
flasks
and
boxes
there
were
so
many
he
hardly
knew
which
to
use
first
flying
fluid
and
vanishing
cream
mused
the
gnome
well
they
might
help
after
he
had
captured
oz
but
he
felt
it
would
take
more
powerful
magic
than
flying
fluid
and
vanishing
cream
to
capture
the
fairy
kingdom
next
he
picked
up
the
bottle
labeled
spike
s
hair
anything
that
strengthened
would
be
helpful
so
with
one
eye
on
the
last
bottle
ruggedo
absently
rubbed
some
of
the
hair
strengthener
on
his
head
he
stopped
rubbing
in
a
hurry
and
put
his
finger
in
his
mouth
with
a
howl
of
pain
then
he
jumped
up
in
alarm
and
ran
to
a
small
mirror
hanging
on
the
wall
every
hair
on
his
head
had
become
an
iron
spike
and
the
result
was
so
terrible
that
it
frightened
even
the
old
gnome
he
flung
the
bottle
angrily
on
the
ground
but
stop
he
could
butt
his
enemies
with
the
sharp
spikes
comforting
himself
with
this
cheerful
thought
ruggedo
returned
to
the
magic

muttered
the
gnome
turning
the
bottle
over
carefully
that
ought
to
make
me
if
i
were
i
were
larger
he
snapped
his
fingers
and
began
hopping
up
and
down
he
was
about
to
empty
the
bottle
over
his
head
when
he
suddenly
reflected
that
it
might
be
safer
to
try
this
powerful
extract
on
someone
else
but
on
whom
ruggedo
glanced
quickly
around
the
cave
and
then
remembered
the
wooden
doll
he
would
try
a
little
on
peg
amy
and
see
how
it
worked
turning
the
key
he
stepped
softly
into
wag
s
room
without
wakening
the
rabbit
ruggedo
dragged
out
the
wooden
doll
propping
her
up
against
the
wall
the
gnome
uncorked
the
bottle
of
expanding

and
dropped
two
drops
on

head
peg
was
about
ten
inches
high
but
no
sooner
had
the
expanding
fluid
touched
her
than
she
shot
up
four
feet
and
with
such
force
that
she
lost
her
balance
and
came
crashing
down
on

of
ruggedo
almost
crushing

the

struggling
furiously
but
this

was
powerless
to
do
and
it
was
only
after
a
frightful
struggle
that
ruggedo
managed
to
drag
himself
out
he
started
to
shake
peg
but
as
she
was
now
four
times
his
size
he
soon
gave
that
up
well
anyway
it
works
sighed
the
gnome
rubbing
his

and
the
middle
of
his
back
i

how
it
would
act
on

i

try

on
that

rabbit
he
concluded
back
into

s
room
now
wag
s
apartment
was
about
seven
feet
large
enough
for
a
regular
two
drops
of
the
expanding
wag
was
no
longer
a
regular
rabbit
but
a
funny
bunny
stretching
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
he
expanded
without
even
waking
up
ruggedo
had
to
squeeze
past
him
in
order
to
get
out
and
chuckling
with
satisfaction
the
gnome
hurried
back
to
his
box
of
magic
his
mind
was
now
made
up
he
would
take
glegg
s
mixed
magic
under
his
arm
go
above
ground
and
with
the
expanding
fluid
change
himself
into
a
giant
then
conquering
oz
would
be
a
simple
matter
it
was
all
going
to
be
so
easy
and
amusing
that
ruggedo
felt
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
examine
the
rest
of
the
bottles
and
boxes
he
rubbed
some
of
the
vanishing
cream
on
a
sofa
cushion
and
it
instantly
disappeared
the
box
of
rays
guaranteed
to
reawaken
anyone
from
enchantment
interested
the
old
gnome
immensely
but
how
could
he
try
them
when
there
was
no
bewitched
person
least
none
that
he
knew
of
then
his
eye
fell
on
the
question
box
why
not
try
that
so
how
shall
i
use
the
rays
asked
ruggedo
shaking
the
box
three
times
nothing
happened
at
first
then
by
the
light
from
his
emerald
lamp
the
gnome
saw
a
sentence
forming
on

lid

on

said
the
box
shortly
without
thinking
of
consequences
or
wondering
what
the
question

meant
by
suggesting
peg
the
curious
gnome
opened
the
box
of
rays
and
held
it
over
the
huge
wooden
doll
for
as
long
as
it
would
take
to
count

with

back
of

his
every

standing
on
end
too
late
he
realized
his
mistake
this
huge
wooden
creature
clattering
around
the

was
positively
dangerous
why
she
might
easily
pound
him
to
bits
why
on

had

meddled
with

and
why
under

should
a

doll
come
to

he
waited
till
peg
had
run
to
the
farthest
end
of

cave
then
he
dashed
to
the
magic
casket
and
scrambled
the
bottles
the
trick
tea
set
and
the
flasks
back
into
place
and
started
for
the
door
that
led
to
the

fast
as
his
crooked
little
legs
would
carry
him

stirred
uneasily
then
as
ruggedo

cries
grew
louder
he
bounced
erect
and
almost
cracked
his
skull
on
the
low
ceiling
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
rushed
at
the
door
only
to
knock
himself
almost
senseless
against
the
top
for
of
course
he
did
not
realize
he
had
expanded
into
a
giant
rabbit
but
as
the
cries
from
the
other
room
became
louder
and
louder
he
got
up
and
rubbing
his
head
in
a
dazed
fashion
he
somehow
crowded
himself
through
the
door
and
hopped
into
the
cave

called
i
ll
catch
him
peg
my
dear
and
make
him
pay
for
all
the
shakings
he
has
given
you
i
ll
pound
his
curly
toes
off
oh
wag
don
t
do
that
cried
the
wooden
doll
stopping
short
i
didn
t
mind
the
shakings
and
gnomes
don
t
know
any
better
neither
do
rabbits
cried
wag
stubbornly
bounding
after
ruggedo
i
ll
pound
his
curly
toes
off
i
tell
you
the
old
gnome
was
sputtering
like
a
firecracker
what
chance
had
he
now
with
two
after
him
then
suddenly
he
had
an
idea
without
stopping
he
fumbled
in
the
box
which
he
still
clutched
under
one
arm
and
pulled
out
the
bottle
of
expanding
fluid
uncorking
the
bottle
he
poured
its
contents
over
his
single
this
is
what
happened
first
he
shot
out
sideways
till
peg
and
wag
were
almost
crushed
against
the
wall
with
a
hoarse
scream
wag
dragged
peg
amy
back
into
his
room
which
was
now
barely
large
enough
to
hold
them
they
were
just
in
time
for
ruggedo
was
still
spreading
soon
there
was
not
an
inch
of
space
left
to
expand
in
then
he
shot
up
and
grew
up
and
grew
and
grew
and
groaned
and
grew
till
there
wasn
t
any
more
room
to
grow
in
so
he
burst
through
the
top
of
the
cave
with
a
noise
like
fifty
boilers
exploding
no
wonder
dorothy
thought
it
was
a
cyclone
for
what
was
on
the
top
of
the
cave
but
the
royal
palace
of
oz
the
next
instant
it
was
impaled
fast
on
the
spikes
of
ruggedo
s
giant
head
and
shooting
up
with
him
toward
the
clouds
and
that
wretched
gnome
never
stopped
growing
till
he
was
of
a
mile
high
illustration
the
royal
palace
of
oz
impaled
fast
on
the
spikes
of
ruggedo
s
giant
head
if
the
people
in
the
palace
were
frightened
ruggedo
was
more
frightened
still
being
a
giant
was
a
new
experience
for
him
and
having
a
castle
jammed
on
his
head
was
worse
still
the
first
thing
he
tried
to
do
when
he
stopped
growing
was
to
lift
the
castle
off
but
his
spikes
were
driven
fast
into
the
foundations
and
it
fitted
closer
than
his
scalp
in
a
panic
ruggedo
began
to
run
and
when
a
giant
runs
he
gets
somewhere
each
step
carried
him
a
half
mile
and
shook
the
country
below
like
an
earthquake
and
rattled
the
people
in
the
castle
above
like
pennies
in
a
christmas
bank
shaking
with
terror
and
hardly
knowing
why
the
gnome
made
for
his
old
kingdom
and
in
an
hour
had
reached
the
little
country
of
oogaboo
which
is
in
the
very
northwestern
corner
of
oz
opposite
his
old
dominions
the
deadly
desert
is
so
narrow
at
this
point
that
with
one
jump
ruggedo
was
across
and
puffing
like
a
volcano
about
to
erupt
he
sank
down
on
the
highest
mountain
in
ev
fortunately
he
had
not
stepped
on
any
cities
in
his
flight
although
he
had
crushed
several
forests
and
about
a
hundred
fences
oh
oh
my
head
groaned
ruggedo
rocking
to
and
fro
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
about
conquering
oz
he
was
full
of
twinges
and
growing
pains
ozma
s
castle
was
giving
him
a
thundering
headache
and
there
he
sat
a
fearsome
figure
in
the
bright
moonlight
moaning
and
groaning
instead
of
conquering
the
book
of
records
had
been
right
indeed
when
it
stated
that
ruggedo
had
something
on
his
mind
ozma
s
castle
itself
sat
squarely
upon
that
mischievous
every
moment
it
seemed
to
grow
heavier
no
wonder
there
had
been
confusion
in
the
castle
every
time
ruggedo
shook
his
aching
head
ozma
and
her
guests
were
tossed
about
like
leaves
in
a
storm
mixed
magic

made
mischief

after

wag
and
peg
amy
had
been
too
stunned
to

crowded
together
in

little
rock

they

breathless

the

in

for
neither

realized
how

they
had

let

go
above

at

they
got
through

clasping
her
wooden
hands
rapturously
real
stars
the
top
of
the
cave
had
gone
off
with
the
old
gnome
king
and
the
two
stood
looking
up
at
the
lovely
skies
of
oz
it
doesn
t
seem
so
high
as
it
used
to
said
the
rabbit
looking
at

why
i
believe
i
could
jump
out
if

run
and

asked

smoothing
down
her
torn
dress
well
now
that
you
mention
it
my

does
feel
queer
admitted
the
rabbit
twitching
his
nose
bort
of
sackwards
sort
of
backwards
corrected
peg
gently
well
never
mind
i
know
what
you

but
do
let

try
to
find
that
awful
box
of
magic
you

ruggedo
brought
me
to
life
wag
with
something
in
that
box
only
good
thing
he
ever
did
said
wag
shaking
his
head
but
i
think
you
were
alive
before
he
added
solemnly
you
always
seemed
alive
to
i
think
so
too
whispered
peg
excitedly
i
can
t
remember
just
how
or
where
but
oh
wag
i
know
i
ve
been
alive
before
i
remember
peg
took
a
few
awkward
steps
and
wag
looked
on
dubiously
too
polite
to
criticize
her
efforts
he
didn
t
even
laugh
when
peg
amy
fell
down
peg
laughed
herself
however
as
merrily
as
possible
it
s
going
to
be
such
fun
being
alive
she
said
picking
herself
up
gaily
such
fun
wag
dear
why
there
s
glegg
s
box
she
pounced
upon
the
little
shining
gold
casket
ruggedo
didn
t
take
it
after
all
is
it
shut
asked
wag
clapping
both
paws
to
his
ears
look
out
for
explosions
say
no
but
i
ll
soon
close
it
said
peg
and
shutting
glegg
s
box
she
slipped
it
into
pocket
of
her
dress
it
was
about
half
the
size
of
this
book
you
are
reading
and
as
peg
s
pockets
were
big
and
old
fashioned
it
fitted
quite
nicely
come
ashort
said
wag
again
looking
around
uneasily
for
he
was
anxious
to
get
out
of
the
gnome
s
cave
so
peg
seated
herself
carefully
on
his
back
and
clasped
her
wooden
arms
around
his
neck
then
wag
ran
back
a
few
steps
gave
a
great
jump
and
sailed
up
up
and
out
of
the
cave
ten
penny
tea
cups
shrieked
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
falling
over
backwards
what
next
for
wag
with
peg
on
his
back
had
leaped
straight
over
his
head
picking
himself
up
and
with
every
whisker
in
his
beard
prickling
straight
on
end
the
grand
army
of
oz
backed
toward
the
royal
stable
when
he
had
backed
half
the
distance
he
turned
and
ran
for
his
life
but
he
need
not
have
been
afraid
what
a
funny
little
man
chuckled
wag
why
he
s
no
bigger
than
we
are
he
s
then
suddenly
wag
clutched
his
ears
oh
he
screamed
beginning
to
hop
up
and
down
i
forgot
all
my
olden
goop
soons
oh
oh

your

it

cause
your
ears
are

there
now

your
whiskers

continued
to
wiggle
his
whiskers
and
turn
in
his
toes
and
roar
for

down
on
a
rock
and

his
head
in
both
paws

don

doll
shook
her
head
don

you

it

just
as
well
ruggedo
stole
all
those
things
and
you
wouldn
t
want
stolen
soup
spoons
now
would
you
wag
took
a
long
breath
and
regarded
peg
uncertainly
then
something
in
her
pleasant
wooden
face
seemed
to
brace
him
up
no
he
sighed
i
s
pose
not
i
ought
to
have
left
rug
long
but
then
you
couldn

have
helped
me
said
peg
brightly
let
s
don
t
think
about
it
any
more
you
ve
been
awfully
good
to
me
have
i
said
wag
more
cheerfully
well
you
re
a
good
sort
regular
princess
he
finished
puffing
out
his
chest
and
anything
you
say
princess
laughed
the
wooden
doll
pleased
nevertheless
i
m
a
funny
princess
in
this
old
dress
did
you
ever
hear
of
a
wooden
princess
wag
you
look
like
a
princess
to
me
said
the
rabbit
stoutly
dresses
don
t
this
speech
so
tickled
the
wooden
doll
that
she
gave
wag
a
good
hug
and
began
dancing
again
being
alive
is
such
fun
she
called
gaily
over
her
shoulder
and
you
are
so
wonderful
wag
s
chest
expanded
at
least
three
inches
and
his
whiskers
trembled
with
emotion
hop
on
my
back
peg
and
i
ll
take
you
anywhere
you
want
to
go
he
puffed
magnificently
but
the
wooden
doll
had
suddenly
grown
sober
wherever
is
the
castle
she
cried
anxiously
she
remembered
exactly
where
it
had
stood
when
she
was
an
unalive
doll
and
now
not
a
tower
or
turret
of
the
castle
was
to
be
seen
oh
groaned
peg
amy
ruggedo
has
done
something
dreadful
with
his
mixed
magic
wag
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
all
around
why
it
s
gone
he
cried
waving
his
paws
what
shall
we
do
if
only
we
weren
t
so
small
we
ve
got
the
magic
box
said
peg
hopefully
and
somehow
i
don
t
feel
as
small
as
i
used
to
feel
do
you
well
i
feel
pretty
queer
myself
said
the
rabbit
twitching
his
nose
maybe
it
s
because
i
m
hungry
there
s
a
kitchen
garden
over
there
near
the
royal
stables
and
i
think
if
i
had
some
carrots
i
d
feel
of
course
you
would
cried
peg
jumping
up
i
forgot
you
had
to
so
very
cautiously
they
stole
into
the
royal
cook
s
garden
wag
had
often
helped
himself
to
carrots
from
this
garden
before
but
now
sitting
on
his
haunches
he
stared
around
in
dazed
surprise
everything
s
different
wailed
the
rabbit
dismally
you
re
the
same
and
i
m
the
same
but
everything
else
is
all
mixed
up
look
at
this
carrot
why
it
s
no
bigger
than
a
blade
of
wag
held
up
a
carrot
in
disgust
why
it
will
take
fifty
of
these
to
give
me
even
a
taste
and
the
at
it
everything
s
shrunk
even
the
houses
cried
the
big
funny
bunny
looking
around
my
wocks
and
hoop
soons
sheverything
s
hunk
peg
amy
had
followed
wag
s
gaze
and
now
she
jumped
up
in
great
excitement
i
see
it
now
cried
peg
it
s
us
wag
everything
s
the
same
but
we
are
different
some
of
that
mixed
magic
has
made
us
grow
we
re
bigger
and
everything
else
is
the
same
i
am
as
tall
as
the
little
girl
who
used
to
play
with
me
and
you
are
even
bigger
and
i
m
glad
because
now
we
can
help
find
the
castle
and
ruggedo
and
try
to
make
everything
right
peg
clasped
her
wooden
hands
aren
t
you
glad
too
wag
the
rabbit
shook
his
head
it
s
going
to
take
an
awful
lot
to
fill
me
up
he
said
doubtfully
i
ll
have
to
eat
about
six
times
as
much
as
i
used
well
you
re
six
times
as
large
isn

that
any
comfort
my
head
doesn

insisted
wag
as
soon
as
i
talk
fast
the
words
all
come
maybe
it
didn
t
grow
as
fast
as
the
rest
of
you
laughed
the
wooden
doll
but
don
t
you
care
wag
i
know
what
you
mean
and
i
think
you
re
just
splendid
now
hurry
and
finish
your
carrots
so
we
can
decide
what
to
do

going
to
look
at

wag
nibbling
industriously
had
not
heard
peg
s
last
speech
or
he
would
doubtless
have
taken
to
his
heels
sitting
unconcernedly
in
a
cabbage
bed
the
wooden
doll
took
the
gold
box
from
her
pocket
fortunately
she
had
not
snapped
the
magic
snap
and
it
opened
quite
easily
her
fingers
were
stiff
and
clumsy
and
the
moon
was
the
only
light
she
had
to
see
by
but
it
did
not
take
peg
amy
long
to
realize
the
importance
of
glegg
s
magic
i
wonder
if
he
rubbed
this
on
the
castle
she
murmured
holding
up
the
bottle
of
vanishing
cream
and
how
would
one
bring
it
back
let
me
see
one
after
the
other
she
took
out
the
bottles
and
boxes
and
the
tiny
tea
set
the
rays
she
passed
over
without
realizing
they
were
responsible
for
bringing
her
to
life
but
the
question
box
peg
pounced
upon
with
eager
curiosity
oh
if
it

would
answer
questions
fluttered
peg
then
holding
the
box
close
to
her
mouth
she
whispered
where
is

said
the
wooden
doll
but
it
s
not

very
she
shook
it
vigorously
and
held
it
up
so
that
the
light
streaming
down
from

fell
directly
on
it

no

peg
felt
in

brought
out
the

box
she
tried
to
open

as
she
had

before

it
was
no

she
pulled
and

and
shook
it

the

the
king
of
the
illumi
nation
while
ruggedo
was
working
all
this
mischief
in
the
emerald
city
pompadore
and
the
elegant
elephant
had
fallen
into
strange
company
after
the
prince
s
disappearance
kabumpo
stared
long
and
anxiously
at
the
white
marble
stone
with
its
mysterious
inscription
knock
before
you
fall
what
would
happen
if
he
knocked
as
the
sign
directed
something
upsetting
the
elegant
elephant
was
sure
else
why
had
pompa
called
for
help
kabumpo
groaned
for
he
was
a
luxurious
beast
and
hated
discomfort
of
any
sort
as
for
falling
very
thought
of
it
made
him
shudder
in
every
pound
but
selfish
and
luxurious
though
he
was
the
elegant
elephant
loved
pompa
with
all
his
heart
after
all
he
had
run
off
with
the
prince
and
was
responsible
for
his
safety
if
pompa
had
fallen
in
he
must
fall
in
too
with
a
resigned
sigh
kabumpo
felt
in
his
pocket
to
see
that
his
treasures
were
safe
straightened
his
robe
and
taking
one
last
long
breath
rapped
sharply
on
the
marble
stone
with
his
trunk
without
a
sound
the
stone
swung
inward
and
as
kabumpo
was
standing
on
it
he
shot
headlong
into
a
great
black
opening
there
was
a
terrific
rush
of
air
and
the
slab
swung
back
catching
as
it
did
so
the
fluttering
edge
of
the
elegant
elephant
s
robe
of
state
this
halted
his
fall
for
about
a
second
and
then
with
a
spluttering
tear
the
silk
fringe
ripped
loose
and
down
plunged
the
elegant
elephant
trunk
over
heels
after
the
third
somersault
kabumpo
right
side
up
fortunately
struck
a
soft
inclined
slide
down
which
he
shot
like
a
scenic
railway
train
great
grump
coughed
kabumpo
holding
his
jeweled
headpiece
with
his
trunk
before
he
reached
the
second
grump
his
head
struck
the
top
of
the
passage
with
terrific
force
and
that
was
the
last
he
remembered
about
his
fall
how
long
he
lay
in
an
unconscious
state
the
elegant
elephant
never
knew
after
what
seemed
several
ages
he
became
aware
of
a
confused
murmur
footsteps
seemed
to
be
pattering
all
around
him
but
he
was
still
too
stunned
to
be
curious
nothing
will
make
me
get
up
thought
kabumpo
dully
i
m
going
to
lie
here
forever
just
as
he
reached
this
drowsy
conclusion
something
red
hot
fell
down
his
neck
and
a
voice
louder
than
all
the
rest
shouted
in
his
ear
are
you
ouch
screamed
kabumpo
now
thoroughly
aroused
he
opened
one
eye
and
rolled
over
on
his
side
a
tall
curious
creature
was
bending
over
him
its
head
was
on
fire
and
as
kabumpo
blinked
angrily
another
red
hot
shower
spattered
into
his
ear
with
a
trumpet
of
rage
kabumpo
lunged
to
his
feet
the
person
fell
over
backwards
and
a
crowd
of
similar
creatures
pattered
off
into
the
corner
and
regarded
kabumpo
uneasily
they
were
as
tall
as
pompa
but
very
thin
and
in
shape
and
their
heads
appeared
to
be
a
mass
of
flickering
flames
like
giant
candles
reflected
the
elegant
elephant
his
curiosity
getting
the
better
of
his
anger
he
glanced
about
hurriedly
he
was
in
a
huge
white
tiled
chamber
and
the
only
lights
came
from
the
heads
of
its
singular
occupants
a

in

sure
enough
he

at

lay
the

of

stiff
and
lifeless
and
with
never

himself
with
while

stared

comfortably
for
they
re
nothing

great
big
seeing
their
king
in
friendly
conversation
with
the

the

candlemen
came
close
for
comfort
in

they
were
always
leaning
over
and
dropping
hot
tallow
on
a
body
and
the
heat
from
their
flaming
heads
was
simply
suffocating
sing
the
national
air
for
them
said
the
candle
king
carelessly
and
the
candlemen
in
their
queer
crackling
voices
sang
the
following
song
swaying
rhythmically
to

tune

kabumpo
indignantly
and
then
he
gave
a
shrill
scream
ten
candlemen
tottered
and
went
out
falling
to
the
ground
with

just
in

for

golden
locks

flames
then
the

tore
off

velvet
jacket

clapped
it
to
kabumpo
s
tail
which
also
was
blazing
merrily

furiously

sets
out
on

elephant
to
find
a

princess
how
many
yards
of
fringe
will
the
elephant
lose
from
his

and
how
bald
will
the
prince
be
at
the
end
of
the
journey
and
we
ve
scarcely
begun
great
hay
stacks
whistled
kabumpo
his
little
eyes
twinkling
so
i
have
lost
every
bit
of
fringe
from
my
robe
and
my
tail
and
half
the
back
of
my
robe
besides
this
is
nice
i

give
you

kabumpo
how
do
we
get
out

here
oh

said
the

cheering
up
tommy

for
the
before
kabumpo

pompa
realized
what
this
would
mean
a
little
candleman
named
tommy
tallow
had
returned
with
a
tall
black
candle
person
he
stepped
to
the
side
wall
quickly
jerked
a
rope
and
down
over
kabumpo
dropped
a
great
brass
snuffer
and
over
the
prince
another
that
ought
to
put
the
cross
old
things
out
pompa
heard
the
king
say
just
before
his
snuffer
reached
the
floor
this
is
terrible
fumed
the
poor
prince
thumping
on
the
sides
of
the
huge
brass
dome
i
might
as
well
have
stayed
at
home
and
disappeared
comfortably
my
poor
old
father
and
my
mother
i
wonder
where
they
are
now
sunk
in
gloomy
reflection
pompadore
leaned
against
the
side
of
the
snuffer
and
one
can
not
blame
him
for
feeling
dismal
the
fall
down
the
deep
passage
the
shock
of
losing
his
hair
and
now
imprisonment
under
a
stifling
brass
dome
were
enough
to
extinguish
the
hopes
of
the
stoutest
hearted
adventurer
i
shall
never
find
a
proper
princess
wailed
pompa
tying
and
untying
his
handkerchief
but
just
then
there
was
a
creak
from
without
and
the
great
dome
lifted
as
suddenly
as
it
had
suddenly
in
fact
that
pompa
fell
flat
on
his
back
there
stood
kabumpo
winding
up
the
long
rope
with
his
trunk
and
grumbling
furiously
all
the
while
takes
more
than
a
snuffer
to
keep
me
down

the
elegant
elephant
hurrying
over
and
jerking
the

to
his
feet
three
humps
of
my
shoulders
and
off
she
goes

it
so
dark

pompa
brushing
his
hand
wearily
across
his

all
except
that
in
a
distant
corner
sat
tommy
tallow
and
the
light
from
his
head
was
the
only
light
in
the
great
chamber
he
was
reading
a
book
with
tin
leaves
and
looked
up
in
surprise
when
he
saw
the
elegant
elephant
and
pompadore
approaching
then
he
started
to
sputter
and
ran
toward

at

side

kabumpo

along
rapidly
i
hear
water
answered
pompa
peering
out
over
kabumpo
s
head
and
there
it
is
rippling
silver
under
the
rays
of
the
moon
which
shone
brightly
lay
a
great
inland
sea
the
trees
had
thinned
out
and
a
smooth
sandy
beach
stretched
down
to
the
shore
a
slight
mist
hung
in
the
air
and
all
around
was
the
delicious
fragrance
of
vegetable
soup
somebody
s
making
soup
sighed
the
prince
but
who
and
where
never
mind
pompa
wheezed
the
elegant
elephant
walking
down
to
the
water
s
edge
perhaps
you
can
catch
some
fish
and
while
you
cook
them
i
ll
go
back
and
eat
some
with
a
jerk
of
his
trunk
kabumpo
pulled
a
length
of
the
heavy
silver
thread
from
his
torn
robe
and
handed
it
up
to
pompa
fastening
a
jeweled
pin
to
one
end
the
prince
cast
his
line
far
out
into
the
waves
at
the
first
tug
he
drew
it
in
what
is
it
asked
the
elegant
elephant
as
pompa
pulled
the
dripping
line
over
his
trunk
oh
how
delicious
how
wonderful
exclaimed
the
once
fastidious
prince
of
pumperdink
kabumpo
could
hear
him
munching
away
with
relish
what
is
it
he
asked
again
a
carrot
a
lovely
red
delightful
tender
carrot
carrot
who
ever
heard
of
a
sea
carrot
grunted
kabumpo
i
m
afraid
you
re
not
yourself
my
boy
let
me
see
snaps
and
crunches
as
pompa
consumed
his
strange
catch
were
the
only
answer
and
in
real
alarm
the
elegant
elephant
moved
away
from
the
shore
and
in
doing
so
bumped
against
a
white
sign
stuck
in
the
sand
please
don
t
fall
in
directed
the
sign
politely
spoils
the
soup
sputtered
kabumpo
then
another
sign
caught
his
eye
to
come
down
here
directly
cried
the
elegant
elephant
snatching
the
prince
from
his
back
here
s
the
whole
sea
full
now
all
you
need
is
a
swallowing
convulsively
the
last
bit
of
carrot
pompa
stood
staring
out
over
the
tossing
smoking
soup
sea
every
now
and
then
a
bone
or
a
vegetable
would
bob
out
of
the
waves
and
the
poor
hungry
prince
of
pumperdink
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
more
lovely
sight
in
his
life
we
ll
probably
be
awarded
a
china
medal
for
this
chuckled
the
elegant
elephant
won
t
old
pumper
s
eyes
stick
out
when
we
tell
him
about
it
but
now
for
a
bowl
swinging
his
trunk
gently
kabumpo
walked
up
the
white
beach
and
had
not
gone
more
than
a
dozen
steps
before
he
came
to
a
cluster
of
huge
shells
he
turned
one
over
curiously
why
it
s
a
soup
bowl
whistled
the
elegant
elephant
he
rushed
back
with
it
to
pompadore
who
still
stood
dreamily
surveying
the
soup
i
never
thought
i
d
be
so
thrilled
by
a
common
soup
bowl
thought
kabumpo
staring
at
the
prince
in
amusement
he
stepped
out
on
a
rock
and
dipped
up
a
bowl
of
the
hot
liquid
here
drink
commanded
the
elegant
elephant
handing
the
bowl
to
the
prince
drink
to
the
proper
princess
and
the
future
queen
of
don
t
go
begged
the
prince
between
gulps
i
shall
want
kabumpo
laughed
good
naturedly
this
is
the
pleasantest
thing
that
has
happened
to
us
here
have
another
then
both
pompa
and
the
elegant
elephant
gasped
for
out
of
the
bubbling
waves
arose
the
most
curious
figure
that
they
had
ever
most
curious
and
the
jolliest
he
was
made
entirely
of
soup
bones
and
his
head
was
a
monster
cabbage
with
a
soup
bowl
set
jauntily
on
the
side
for
a
cap
for
a
cabbage
head
he
sang
very
well
and
this
was
the
song
to
which
he
kept
time
by
waving
a
silver
ladle
ho
i
am
the
king
of
the
soup
sea
yes
i
am
the
king
of
the
deep
my
crown
is
a
bowl
and
my
sceptre
a
ladle
i
fell
in
the
soup
when
i
fell
from
the
cradle
and
find
it
exceedingly
cheap
i
stir
it
up
nightly
and
pepper
it
a
liquid
perfection
you
ll
find
and
here
is
a
roll
sirs
so
fill
up
your
bowl
sirs
and
think
of
me
after
you
ve
when
he
came
to
dined
the
soup
king
gave
a
playful
leap
and
disappeared
backward
into
the
waves
pompa
rubbed
his
eyes
and
looked
at
kabumpo
to
see
whether
he
had
been
dreaming
oh
cried
kabumpo
his
eyes
as
round
as
little
saucers
floating
gently
toward
them
were
two
large
crisp
buttered
rolls
the
most
charming
king
i
ve
ever
met
chuckled
kabumpo
scooping
up
the
rolls
and
handing
them
to
pompa
pompa
staring
dreamily
ahead
first
took
a
drink
of
soup
then
a
nibble
of
roll
too
happy
for
speech
four
times
the
elegant
elephant
refilled
the
bowl
then
his
stomach
full
for
the
first
time
since
they
had
left
pumperdink
the
prince
stretched
himself
out
on
the
sands
now
puffed
the
elegant
elephant
ceremoniously
if
you
think
you
ve
had
quite
enough
i
ll
snatch
a
few
bites
chuckling
softly
he
made
his
way
back
to
some
young
trees
and
dined
luxuriously
off
their
tops
when
he
returned
to
the
beach
pompa
was
fast
asleep
and
for
a
few
moments
kabumpo
was
inclined
to
sleep
himself
but
then
he
reflected
ozma
may
require
a
lot
of
coaxing
before
she
consents
to
marry
pompa
and
two
of
our
precious
seven
days
are
gone
it
is
plainly
my
duty
to
save
pumperdink
besides
when
pompa
is
married
he
will
be
king
of
oz
then
i
the
elegant
elephant
will
be
the
biggest
figure
at
kabumpo
threw
up
his
trunk
and
trumpeted
softly
to
the
stars
then
giving
himself
a
big
shake
and
a
little
stretch
he
lifted
the
sleeping
prince
to
his
back
and
started
on
again
in
about
two
hours
he
had
circled
the
soup
sea
and
guiding
himself
by
a
particularly
bright
and
twinkling
star
ran
swiftly
and
steadily
toward
the
south
as
the
first
streaks
of
dawn
appeared
in
the
sky
kabumpo
passed
through
a
quaint
little
gilliken
village
he
snatched
a
bag
of
rolls
from
a
doorstep
and
stuck
them
into
his
pocket
but
he
did
not
stop
and
so
fast
asleep
was
the
little
village
that
except
for
a
few
wideawake
roosters
no
one
knew
how
important
a
person
had
passed
through
the
sky
grew
pinker
and
pinker
you
have
no
idea
how
pink
the
morning
skies
in
oz
can
be
just
as
the
sun
got
out
of
bed
the
elegant
elephant
came
to
the
wonderful
emerald
city
itself
shining
and
fairylike
as
a
dream
under
the
lovely
colors
of
sunrise
kabumpo
paused
and
took
a
deep
breath
even
he
was
impressed
and
it
took
a
good
bit
to
impress
him
he
reached
back
and
touched
pompa
with
his
trunk
wake
up
my
boy
whispered
kabumpo
in
a
trembling
voice
wake
up
and
put
on
your
crown
for
we
have
come
to
the
city
of
your
proper
pompa
sat
up
and
rubbed
his
eyes
in
amazement
without
a
word
he
took
the
crown
kabumpo
handed
up
to
him
and
set
it
on
his
scorched
golden
head
accustomed
as
pompa
was
to
grandeur
for
pumperdink
is
very
magnificent
in
its
funny
way
he
could
not
help
but
gasp
at
ozma
s
fair
city
the
lovely
green
parks
the
houses
studded
with
countless
emeralds
the
shining
marble
streets
filled
the
prince
with
wonder
i
don
t
believe
she
ll
ever
marry
me
he
stuttered
beginning
to
feel
quite
frightened
at
his
boldness
nonsense
wheezed
kabumpo
faintly
he
was
beginning
to
have
misgivings
himself
sit
up
now
look
your
best
and
i
ll
carry
you
straight
into
the
palace
no
one
was
awake
even
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
lay
snoring
against
a
tree
so
that
kabumpo
stole
unobserved
into
the
royal
gardens
i
don
t
see
the
palace
whispered
pompa
anxiously
wouldn
t
it
show
above
the
trees
it
ought
to
said
kabumpo
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
but
look
who
is
that
pompa
s
heart
almost
stopped
and
even
kabumpo
s
gave
a
queer
jump
on
a
golden
bench
just
ahead
sat
the
loveliest
person
either
had
seen
in
all
of
their
eighteenth
birthdays
ozma
gasped
the
elegant
elephant
as
soon
as
he
had
breath
enough
to
whisper
what
luck
you
must
ask
her
at
not
now
begged
the
prince
of
pumperdink
as
kabumpo
unceremoniously
helped
him
to
the
ground
his
knees
shook
his
tongue
stuck
to
the
roof
of
his
mouth
he
had
never
proposed
to
a
fairy
princess
before
in
his
whole
life
then
all
at
once
he
had
an
idea
slipping
his
hand
into
the
elegant
elephant
s
pocket
he
drew
out
the
magic
mirror
i
ll
see
if
she
s
a
princess
stuttered
pompa
the
elephant
shook
his
head
angrily
but
was
afraid
to
speak
again
lest
he
disturb
the
quiet
figure
on
the
bench
and
i
ll
not
propose
unless
she
is
the
one
said
pompa
toward
the
bench
without
making
a
sound
he
suddenly
held
the
mirror
before
the
startled
and
lovely
lady
glinda
good
sorceress
of
oz
flashed
the
mirror
promptly
great
gooseberries
cried
glinda
springing
to
her
feet
in
alarm
and
swinging
around
on
pompa
where
did
you
come
from
after
studying
a
whole
day
and
night
in
her
magic
books
glinda
had
returned
to
the
emerald
city
to
try
to
perfect
her
plan
for
rescuing
ozma
from
pumperdink
your
highness
puffed
kabumpo
lunging
forward
anxiously
he
too
had
seen
the
words
in
the
mirror
and
the
fear
of
offending
a
sorceress
made
him
quake
in
his
was
loose
enough
to
quake
in
dear
knows
a
thousand
pardons
cried
the
prince
dropping
on
one
knee
and
taking
off
his
crown
we
were
seeking
princess
ozma
the
fairy
ruler
of
glinda
looked
from
kabumpo
to
the
prince
and
controlled
a
desire
to
laugh
the
elegant
elephant
s
torn
and
scorched
robe
hung
in
rags
from
his
shoulders
and
his
jeweled
headpiece
was
dangling
over
one
ear
pompa
s
clothes
were
equally
shabby
and
his
almost
bald
head
with
a
lock
sticking
up
here
and
there
gave
him
a
singular
and
comical
appearance
illustration
unlabelled
pumperdink
mused
glinda
tapping
her
foot
thoughtfully
then
like
a
flash
she
remembered
the
entry
in
the
book
of
the
prince
of
pumperdink
is
journeying
toward
the
emerald
why
did
you
want
to
see
ozma
asked
glinda
anxiously
perhaps
these
two
strangers
could
throw
some
light
on
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
the
royal
palace
our
country
was
threatened
with
disappearance
and
i
he
thought
ozma
might
help
us
finished
the
elegant
elephant
breathlessly
he
did
not
believe
in
telling
strange
sorceresses
about
everything
now
if
glinda
had
not
been
so
occupied
with
the
disappearance
of
the
palace
and
all
the
dearest
people
in
oz
she
might
have
been
more
curious
about
the
disappearance
of
pumperdink
as
it
was
she
just
shook
her
head
sadly
i
m
afraid
ozma
can
not
help
you
she
said
for
ozma
herself
has
and
everyone
in
the
disappeared
trumpeted
the
elegant
elephant
sitting
down
with
a
thud
great
grump
the
thing
s
getting
to
be
a
habit
what
was
to
become
of
pompa
now
would
he
never
be
king
nor
he
kabumpo
ever
be
known
as
the
most
elegant
elephant
in
oz
had
they
made
the
long
journey
in
vain
where
when
gasped
prince
pompadore
night
before
last
explained
glinda
i
ve
been
consulting
my
magic
books
ever
since
but
have
only
been
able
to
discover
one
what
is
that
asked
kabumpo
faintly
that
they
are
in
ev
said
glinda
and
that
a
giant
carried
them
off
i
came
here
early
this
morning
to
see
whether
i
could
discover
anything
new
would
you
care
to
see
where
the
castle
stood
did
he
carry
the
castle
off
too
shuddered
pompa
glinda
nodded
gloomily
and
led
them
over
to
the
great
hole
in
the
center
of
the
gardens
for
a
minute
she
stood
watching
them
then
glancing
at
a
golden
sun
dial
set
in
the
center
of
a
lovely
flower
bed
she
murmured
half
to
herself
i
must
be
off
next
instant
she
clapped
her
hands
and
down
swept
a
shining
chariot
drawn
by
white
swans
called
glinda
springing
in
lightly
i
m
off
to
ev
to
try
my
magic
against
the
giant
s
wait
here
and
when
i
ve
helped
ozma
perhaps
i
can
help
you
can
t
we
help
can
t
we
go
cried
pompa
running
a
few
steps
after
the
chariot
but
glinda
already
high
in
the
air
did
not
hear
him
and
in
the
wink
of
an
eye
the
chariot
and
its
lovely
occupant
had
melted
into
the
pink
morning
clouds
now
what
shall
we
do
groaned
the
prince
letting
his
arms
drop
heavily
at
his
sides
do
snorted
kabumpo
the
thing
for
you
to
do
is
to
act
like
a
prince
instead
of
a
gooch
there
are
other
ways
of
getting
to
ev
than
by
the
thought
of
kabumpo
in
glinda
s
chariot
made
pompa
smile
in
spite
of
himself
there
that
s
better
said
the
elegant
elephant
more
pleasantly
now
what
s
to
hinder
us
from
going
to
ev
and
rescuing
princess
ozma
she
couldn
t
help
marrying
you
if
you
saved
her
from
a
giant
could
she
but
could
i
save
s
the
question
muttered
the
prince
looking
uneasily
at
the
yawning
cavity
where
the
castle
had
stood
this
giant
must
be
a
terrible
fellow
pooh
said
kabumpo
airily
who
s
afraid
of
giants
i
ll
wind
my
trunk
around
his
leg
and
pull
him
to
earth
then
you
can
dispatch
the
villain
we
must
get
you
a
sword
though
he
added
softly
all
right
i
ll
do
it
cried
the
prince
throwing
out
his
chest
the
very
thought
of
killing
a
giant
made
him
feel
about
ten
feet
high
do
you
know
the
way
to
ev
kabumpo
we
ll
have
to
hurry
because
unless
i
marry
ozma
before
the
seven
days
are
up
my
poor
old
father
and
mother
and
all
of
pumperdink
will
disappear
you
see
even
pompa
had
now
got
it
into
his
head
that
ozma
was
the
proper
princess
mentioned
in
the
scroll
we
ll
start
at
once
sighed
the
elegant
elephant
a
bit
ruefully
i
ve
had
no
sleep
and
precious
little
to
eat
but
when
you
are
king
of
oz
you
can
reward
old
kabumpo
as
he
everything
i
have
will
be
yours
cried
the
prince
giving
the
elephant
or
as
much
of
him
as
he
could
grasp
a
sudden
hug
then
each
took
a
long
drink
from
one
of
the
bubbling
fountains
and
munching
the
rolls
kabumpo
had
picked
up
in
the
gilliken
village
the
two
adventurers
stole
out
of
the
gardens
as
they
reached
the
gates
kabumpo
paused
and
his
little
eyes
twinkled
with
delight
there
lay
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
snoring
tremendously
and
beside
him
was
a
long
sharp
sword
with
an
emerald
handle
just
what
we
need
chuckled
kabumpo
snatching
it
up
in
his
trunk
then
out
through
the
gates
and
swiftly
through
the
still
sleeping
city
swept
the
elegant
elephant
and
the
prince
of
pumperdink

to

at
the
little
ruffly
pink
clouds
how
wonderful
it
is
to
be
alive
hello
robin
she
called
gaily
as
a
bird
flew
to
a
low
bush
beside
her
are
your
children
quite
well
the
robin
swung
backward
and
forward
on
his
swaying
branch
then
burst
into
his
best
morning
song
oh
cried
peg
amy
clasping
her
wooden
hands
i
ve
heard
that
before
but
how
could
i
she
reasoned
i
m
only
a
wooden
doll
and
this
is
the
first
morning
i
have
been
alive
but
then
how
did
i
know
it
was
a
robin
peg
rubbed
her
wooden
forehead
in
perplexity
for
it
was
all
very
puzzling
indeed
below
their
little
hill
stretched
the
lovely
land
of
the
winkies
with
its
great
green
forests
and
little
yellow
villages
the
wind
sent
the
leaves
dancing
above
peg
s
head
and
the
early
sunbeams
made
lovely
patterns
on
the
grass
i
ve
seen
it
before
gasped
the
wooden
doll
breathlessly
the
trees
the
birds
the
houses
and
everything
springing
to
her
feet
she
ran
awkwardly
from
bush
to
tree
touching
the
leaves
and
bending
over
the
flowers
as
if
they
were
old
friends
had
it
not
been
for
the
squeaking
of
her
wooden
joints
peg
would
almost
have
forgotten
she
was
a
wooden
doll
for
at
the
sight
of
the
lovely
green
growing
things
something
warm
and
sunny
seemed
to
waken
in
her
stiff
wooden
breast
i
ve
been
alive
before
said
peg
amy
over
and
over
suddenly
through
the
still
morning
air
came
a
loud
shrill
laugh
peg
who
had
been
standing
with
her
cheek
pressed
closely
against
a
small
tree
swung
around
quickly
in
fact
that
she
fell
over
and
lay
in
a
ridiculously
bent
double
position
before
the
it
was
kabumpo
and
the
prince
of
pumperdink
traveling
by
the
same
road
wag
had
chosen
but
much
more
rapidly
the
elegant
elephant
had
come
at
sunrise
to
the
little
hill
he
had
been
watching
peg
for
some
time
and
when
he
saw
her
dance
awkwardly
over
to
the
tree
he
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
get
out
your
mirror
roared
kabumpo
shaking
all
over
with
mirth
here
is
your
proper
princess
pompa
my
royal
a
maiden
as

boasts

don

snapped
pompa
looking
down
curiously
at
the
comical
figure
of
peg
amy
but
she
s
so
funny
gasped
kabumpo
the
tears
rolling
down
his
big
cheeks
who
s
funny
demanded
an
angry
voice
and
wag
who
had
been
awakened
by
kabumpo
s
loud
roars
hopped
up
his
ears
quivering
with
rage
i
ll
pull
your
long
nose
for
you
cried
wag
advancing
threateningly
don
t
you
dare
make
fun
of
peg
what
are
you
anyway
great
grump
choked
kabumpo
without
answering
wag
s
inquiry
what
kind
of
a
rabbit
is
this
a
clawing
chawing
scratching
you
ll
soon
find
out
wag
drew
himself
up
into
a
ball
and
prepared
to
launch
himself
at
kabumpo
s
head
when
peg
straightened
up
and
caught
him
by
the
ear
don
t
wag
please
she
begged
he
couldn
t
help
laughing
i
am
funny
you
know
i
am
she
sighed
a
bit
ruefully
you
re
not
funny
to
me
blustered
wag
still
glaring
at
kabumpo
who
does
he
think
he
is
i
sniffed
kabumpo
spreading
out
his
ears
complacently
i
am
the
elegant
elephant
of
pumperdink
notice
my
pearls
gaze
upon
my
you
don
t
look
very
elegant
to
me
snorted
wag
you
look
more
like
a
tramp
says
he
s
a
lelegant
nelephant
from
dumperpink
he
whispered
scornfully
to
peg
and
what
s
that
you
ve
got
on
your
back
he
called
with
a
wave
of
his
paw
at
pompa
a
dunce
dunce
screamed
kabumpo
furiously
this
is
the
prince
of
pumperdink
you
what
do
you
mean
by
laughing
at
royalty
royalty
oh
ha
ha
ha
roared
wag
rolling
over
and
over
in
the
grass
but
he
s
so
funny
he
paused
to
take
another
look
at
the
prince
at
this
kabumpo
lunged
forward
his
eyes
snapping
angrily
stop
begged
the
prince
tugging
kabumpo
by
the
ear
you
were
rude
to
his
friend
so
you
must
expect
him
to
be
rude
to
me
it
s
all
your
fault
he
added
reproachfully
are
you
a
prince
asked
peg
amy
staring
up
at
pompa
with
her
round
painted
eyes
of
course
he
s
a
prince
didn
t
i
say
so
before
who
is
that
hoppy
creature
that
s
a
dear
peg
smiled
confidently
at
kabumpo
and
he
was
suddenly
ashamed
of
himself
for
laughing
at
her
well
he
needn
t
get
waggish
with
me
grumbled
the
elegant
elephant
in
a
lower
voice
oh
don
t
quarrel
begged
peg
it
s
such
a
lovely
morning
and
you
both
look
so
kabumpo
eyed
the
big
wooden
doll
attentively
it
was
smart
of
her
to
think
him
interesting
he
cleared
his
throat
gruffly
you
re
not
as
funny
as
you
look
he
admitted
grandly
which
was
the
nearest
to
an
apology
he
had
ever
come
but
what
are
you
doing
here
and
why
are
you
alive
i
don
t
know
explained
peg
apologetically
it
just
happened
last
it
did
well
where
are
you
going
illustration

wag
still
looked
cross
and
his
nose
was
twitching
violently
but
peg
politely
answered
kabumpo
s
question
we
re
on
our
way
to
ev
to
try
to
help
ozma
said
the
wooden
doll
folding
her
hands
quaintly
why
so
are
cried
pompa
sliding
down
kabumpo
s
trunk
in
a
hurry
how
do
expect
to
help
her
grunted
kabumpo
looking
at
wag
and
peg
contemptuously
don
t
mind
him
begged
pompa
running
up
to
peg
amy
tell
me
everything
you
know
about
ozma
is
she
pretty
beautiful
breathed
peg
looking
up
at
the
sky
beautiful
and
lovely
and
good
that
s
why
i
want
to
help
then
i
sha

said
pompa
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
gooch
roared
kabumpo
telling
everything
you
know
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
ozma
would
marry
gasped
wag
sitting
up
with
a
jerk
oh
my
wocks
and
hoop
soons
his
ears
crossed
and
uncrossed
and
with
a
final
gurgle
of
disbelief
wag
fell
back
on
the
grass
well
is
there
anything
so
strange
in
that
asked
pompa
in
a
hurt
voice
i
ve
to
marry
her
he
added
desperately
appealing
to
peg
amy
and
while
kabumpo
stood
sulkily
swinging
his
trunk
the
prince
told
peg
the
whole
story
of
the
magic
scroll
i
said
you
looked
interesting
breathed
peg
as
pompa
paused
for
breath
did
you
hear
that
wag
unless
he
marries
a
proper
princess
in
a
proper
time
his
whole
kingdom
will
kingdom
and
everyone
in
it
but
how
do
you
know
ozma
is
the
proper
princess
asked
wag
chewing
a
blade
of
grass
the
scroll
didn
t
say
ozma
did
it
kabumpo
thinks
ozma
is
the
proper
princess
explained
pompadore
nodding
toward
the
elegant
elephant
and
he
s
usually
right
humph
sniffed
wag
well
maybe
you
are
a
prince
you
re
not
really
bad
looking
if
you
had
some
fur
on
your
head
he
remarked
more
amiably
what
happened
somebody
pull
it
out
oh
wag
murmured
peg
amy
in
a
shocked
voice
burned
off
sighed
pompa
and
proceeded
to
tell
of
their
fall
into
the
illumi
nation
he
even
told
them
about
the
soup
sea
and
of
their
meeting
with
glinda
the
good
don
t
you
care
said
the
big
wooden
doll
as
pompa
mournfully
rubbed
his
scorched
head
it
will
soon
grow
again
and
i
don
t
see
how
ozma
could
help
loving
re
so
tall
and
so
this
kind
little
speech
affected
pompa
so
deeply
that
he
dropped
on
one
knee
and
raised
peg
s
wooden
hand
to
his
lips
the
creature
has
a
lot
of
sense
mumbled
kabumpo
with
his
mouth
full
of

exclaimed
wag
sitting
up
straight
and
opening
his
eyes
wide
her

sniffed
kabumpo
hastily
but
you
ll
have
to
admit
she
s
of

she
is
said
wag
complacently
that
s
why
i
like
her
she
wasn
t
cut
out
to
be
a
beauty
but
to
be
companionable
and
she
is
when

heartily

curtseyed
awkwardly
i

done
this
before
she
reflected
curiously
to
herself

asked
aloud
turning
to
wag
yes

begged
pompa
tell

something
about

i
never
saw
so
large
a
rabbit
in
my

as

him

patting
her
pocket
softly
in

pointing
a

kabumpo
how

in
with
them

held
out
his
trunk

the
box
my
good
girl
and
you
shall
be
fittingly
rewarded
when

by
kabumpo
s
outrageous
impudence

i
will
just
keep
the
box

said
prince
pompadore
frowning
at
kabumpo
but
as

bound
on
the

errand

travel
together
kabumpo
and
i
are
going

out
his
hand
impulsively
well
that

wag
pulling
his
ear
thoughtfully
and
four
heads
are
better
than
two
of
course
we
ll
help
you
cried
peg
amy
the
trouble
is
we
don

know
ourselves
how
to

the
magic
box
but
we
do
know
that

in
ev
and
when
we
get
there
we
will
make
him
open
the
box
and
undo
all
this

kabumpo
holding
up
his
trunk
who
is
ruggedo
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
ozma
ruggedo
is
a
wicked
little
gnome
explained
peg
amy
gravely
he
used
to
be
king
of
the
gnomes
but
he
was
banished
from
his
kingdom
and
ozma
gave
him
a
little
cottage
in
the
emerald
city
he
pretended
to
live
there
but
instead
he
tunneled
a
cave
right
underneath
the
palace
wag
helped
him
peg
waved
her
hand
at
the
rabbit
and
he
was
the
only
one
who
would
stay
with
him
then
ruggedo
stole
me

me
just
to

continued
peg
shuddering
that
s
why
i
m
going
to
pound
his
curly
toes
off
screamed
wag
beginning
to
hop
about
at
the
very
thought
of
ruggedo
but
how
did
you
come
to
be
so
large
and
alive
asked
kabumpo
who
was
growing
more
interested
well
one
night
dropped
her
voice
to
a
one
night
ruggedo
found
this
box
of
mixed
magic
hidden
in
the
cave
and
then
screamed
wag
hoarsely
in
some
way

understand
peg
and
i
grew

in

meanwhile
strange
things
had
been
happening
in

palace
for
the
people
inside
it
had
been
a
very
mean
time
indeed
during
ruggedo
s
run
to
the
mountains
of
ev
they
had
almost
been
shaken
out
of
their
wits
and
when
he
sat
down
upon
the
mountain
top
there
was
not
a
person
nor
piece
of
furniture
standing
in
the
whole
palace
courtiers
and
servants
who
were
not
knocked
senseless
lay
shaking
in
their
beds
or
huddled
in
corners
and
under
sofas
and
chairs
just
as
they
had
fallen
when
the
first
terrible
crash
lifted
the
palace
into

collapsed
pinning
the

under

was
unhurt
but
not
being
able
to
move
nor
to
reach
her
magic
belt
or
even
make
herself
heard
she
was
forced
to
lie
perfectly
still
and
wait
for
help
in
dorothy
s
sitting
room
there
was
not
a
sound
but
the
ticking
of
the
copper
man
s
machinery
trot
and
betsy
bobbin
had
knocked
their
heads
together
so
smartly
that
they
were
unconscious
sir
hokus
had
been
hurled
violently
against
tik
tok
and
the
poor
knight
had
known
nothing
since
dorothy
lay
quietly
beside
him
an
ugly
bruise
on
her
forehead
where
the
emerald
clock
had
landed

after

gasped
the

work
girl
sitting
up
cautiously
she
had
bounced
all
around
the
room
and
finally
rolled
into
a
corner
quite
close
to
the
scarecrow
himself
she
put
out
her
cotton
hand
as
she
spoke
and
touched
him
how
fortunate
we
are
unbreakable
said
the
scarecrow
pressing
her
cotton
fingers
convulsively
and
trying
to
peer
out
through
the
intense
blackness
of
the
room
what
happened
earthquake
shivered
scraps
and
maybe
it
s
not

must
have
knocked

the

in

on

her

closed
over

hokus
armor
and
looked
anxiously
around
the
room
they
need
water
said
the
patch
work
girl
wrinkling
up
her
patchwork
forehead
so
will
you
if
you
don
t
blow
out
that
match
cried
the
scarecrow
in
alarm
for
scraps
continued
to
hold
the
match
till
it
burned
to
the
very
end
he
jumped
up
clumsily
and
puffed
out
the
light
just
in
time
scraps
promptly
lit
another
and
as
she
did
so
the
scarecrow
saw
a
tall
blue
candle
sticking
out
of
the
waste
basket
here
said
the
straw
man
nervously
light
this
and
stand
it
on
the
mantel
by
the
flickering
candle
light
the
scarecrow
and
scraps
tried
to
set
dorothy
s
room
to
rights
they
dragged
the
mattress
from
the
and
placed
the
little
girls
on
it
side
by
side
sir
hokus
was
too
heavy
to
move
so
they
merely
loosened
his
armor
and
put
a
sofa
cushion
under
his
head
then
just
as
scraps
was
going
for
some
water
the
room
began
to
tremble
again
i
told
you
it
wasn
t
over
cried
scraps
flinging
both
arms
about
the
scarecrow
s
neck
and
as
they
rocked
to
and
fro
she
shouted
merrily
shaker
shaker
who
art
thee
to
shake
a
castle
like
a
tree
shaker
shaker
go
away
and
come
again
some
other
day
now
scraps
begged
the
scarecrow
steadying
the
patch
work
girl
with
one
hand
and
catching
hold
of
a
table
with
the
other
everything
depends
on
us
do
try
to
keep
your
head
keep
my
head
shrilled
scraps
as
the
room
tilted
over
and
slid
all
the
furniture
sideways
i
ll
be
lucky
if
i
keep
my
feet
whoopee
here
we
go
and
go
they
did
with
a
rush
into
the
farthest
corner
slowly
the
room
righted
itself
and
everything
grew
quiet
again

i
know
what
i
m
going
to
do
said
the
scarecrow
determinedly
before
anything
else
happens
i
m
going
to
see
what
has
happened
how
asked
scraps
bouncing
to
her
feet
illustration
dorothy
and
toto
the
magic
picture
gasped
the
scarecrow
you
bring
the
candle
scraps
like
a
good
girl
you
re
less
liable
to
take
fire
than
i
am
then
we
ll
come
back
and
help
dorothy
and
the
good
idea
said
scraps
taking
the
candle
from
the
mantel
breathlessly
the
two
along
the
hall
to
ozma
s
apartment
on
the
wall
in
one
of
ozma
s
rooms
hangs
the
most
magic
possession
in
oz
it
is
a
picture
representing
a
country
scene
but
when
you
ask
it
where
a
certain
person
is
immediately
he
is
shown
in
the
picture
and
also
what
he
is
doing
at
the
time
so
murmured
the
scarecrow
as
they
gained
the
room
in
safety
if
it
tells
where
other
people
are
it
ought
to
tell
us
where
we
are
drawing
aside
the
curtain
that
covered
the
picture
the
scarecrow
demanded
loudly
where
are
we
scraps
held
the
candle
so
that
its
flickering
rays
fell
directly
on
the
picture
then
both
jumped
in
earnest
for
in
a
flash
the
face
of
ruggedo
the
wicked
old
gnome
king
appeared
on
his
head
a
great
green
towering
sort
of
hat
the
scarecrow
seized
the
candle
from
scraps
and
held
it
closer
to
the
picture
he
squinted
up
one
eye
and
almost
rubbed
his
painted
nose
off
great
kinkajous
spluttered
the
straw
man
distractedly
that
s
a
palace
on
his
emerald
s
palace
but
how
asked
scraps
her
suspender
button
eyes
almost
dropping
out
he
s
nothing
but
a
gnome
he
illustration
unlabelled
before
scraps
could
finish
her
sentence
the
palace
began
to
tilt
forward
and
they
both
fell
upon
their
faces
then
the
picture
jerked
loose
and
fell
with
a
clattering
slam
on
their
heads
followed
by
such
ornaments
as
had
not
already
tumbled
down
before
through
it
all
scraps
held
the
candle
high
in
air
and
fortunately
it
did
not
go
out
despite
the
turmoil
in
a
few
moments
the
palace
stopped
rocking
and
a
muffled
call
from
ozma
sent
the
scarecrow
and
scraps
hurrying
to
her
bedside
after
some
trouble
for
they
were
both
flimsily
made
they
managed
to
free
the
little
princess
of
oz
from
the
poles
and
bed
curtains
goodness
sighed
ozma
looking
around
at
the
terrible
confusion
not
goodness
but
badness
said
the
scarecrow
settling
his
hat
firmly
and
ruggedo
is
at
the
bottom
of
it
and
of
he
quickly
explained
to
ozma
what
he
had
seen
in
the
magic
picture
slipping
on
a
silk
robe
ozma
followed
them
into
the
next
room
when
the
picture
had
been
rehung
they
all
looked
again
this
time
ozma
asked
where
the
palace
was
immediately
the
old
gnome
king
appeared
and
there
could
be
no
palace
was
set
squarely
on
his
head
the
picture
did
not
show
the
real
size
of
ruggedo
nor
of
the
palace
but
it
was
enough
he
must
have
sprung
into
a
giant
gasped
ozma
scarcely
believing
her
eyes
oh
what
shall
we
do
the
first
thing
to
do
is
to
keep
him
quiet
every
time
he
shakes
his
head
it
tumbles
us
about
so
complained
the
scarecrow
plumping
up
the
straw
in
his
chest
and
we
must
look
after
dorothy
and
betsy
and
and
sir
hokus
added
the
patch
work
girl
flinging
out
one
hand
he
s
yearning
to
slay
a
giant
way
for
the
giant
killer
without
waiting
for
the
others
scraps
ran
back
to
dorothy
s
sitting
room
lighting
another
candle
for
all
the
lights
in
the
palace
were
out
ozma
and
the
scarecrow
followed
odds
goblins
gasped
the
knight
as
they
entered
he
was
sitting
up
with
one
hand
to
his
head
not
cried
the
patch
work
girl
with
a
bounce
while
ozma
ran
for
some
water
to
restore
her
three
little
friends
where
puffed
the
knight
lurching
to
his
feet
beneath
you
said
the
scarecrow
clutching
at
a
wisp
of
straw
that
stuck
out
of
his
head
say
some
one
wind
up
tik
tok
there
s
a
lot
of
thinking
to
be
done
here
and
his
head
works
very
well
even
if
it
has
wheels
sir
hokus
though
still
a
bit
dizzy
hastened
to
wind
up
all
the
copper
man
s
keys
thanks
said
tik
tok
immediately
give
me
a
lift
up
the
knight
obligingly
helped
the
copper
man
to
his
feet
then
both
stared
in
amazement
at
the
topsy
turvy
room
even
in
the
dim
candle
light
they
could
see
that
something
very
serious
had
occurred
jack
pumpkinhead
picked
himself
up
out
of
a
corner
looking
very
much
dazed
illustration
jack
pumpkinhead
just
then
dorothy
opened
her
eyes
and
betsy
and
trot
spluttering
from
the
water
the
patch
work
girl
was
pouring
on
their
heads
sat
up
and
wanted
to
know
what
had
happened
in
a
few
words
ozma
told
them
what
the
magic
picture
had
revealed
ruggedo
to
a
giant
s
grown
and
set
us
on
his
head
we
ve
made
some
headway
you
ll
admit
since
we
have
gone
to
bed
scraps
who
was
growing
more
and
more
excited
will
ticked
the
copper
man
sadly
but
what
are
we
going
to
do
wailed
dorothy
suppose
he
leans
over
and
spills
us
all
out
i
shall
take
my
sword
said
sir
hokus
speaking
very
determinedly
and
backing
toward
the
window
as
he
spoke
climb
down
and
slay
the
he
threw
one
leg
over
the
sill
come
back
cried
ozma
dear
sir
hokus
don
t
you
realize
that
if
you
kill
ruggedo
he
will
fall
down
and
break
us
to
pieces
besides
wicked
as
he
is
i
could
not
have
him
yes
we
should
be
all
broken
up
if
you
did
that
sighed
the
scarecrow
we
must
try
something
reluctantly
the
knight
dropped
back
into
the
room
close
the
windows
ordered
ozma
with
a
little
shudder
i
ve
thought
of
a
plan
said
tik
tok
in
his
slow
painstaking
way
a
good
tell
us
what
it
is
begged
dorothy
and
oh
tik
tok
hurry
eggs
said
the
copper
man
solemnly
oh
gasped
dorothy
i
remember
eggs
are
the
only
things
in
oz
that
ruggedo
is
afraid
of
for
if
an
egg
touches
a
gnome
he
shrivels
up
and
then
where
are
the
eggs
demanded
sir
hokus
gloomily
in
faith
this
sounds
more
like
an
omelet
than
a
battle
but
if
we
re
to
fight
with
eggs
instead
of
swords
let
us
draw
them
at
you
mean
throw
them
corrected
dorothy
but
tik
tok
shook
his
head
violently
not
throw
them
said
the
copper
man
slowly
to
throw
but
how
can
we
threaten
a
giant
so
far
below
us
asked
ozma
print
a
sign
directed
tik
tok
calmly
and
it
down
to
tik
tok
cried
the
scarecrow
rushing
forward
and
embracing
him
impulsively
your
brains
are
marvels
i
couldn
t
have
thought
up
a
better
plan
illustration
unlabelled
now
off
ran
scraps
to
fetch
a
huge
piece
of
cardboard
and
the
scarecrow
for
a
paint
brush
and
sir
hokus
for
a
piece
of
rope
it
s
growing
lighter
quavered
trot
looking
toward
the
windows
the
sky
was
turning
gray
with
little
streaks
of
pink
and
the
three
girls
huddled
together
on
the
mattress
gave
a
sigh
of
relief
for
nothing
not
even
a
giant
seems
so
bad
by
daylight
perhaps
someone
has
already
started
to
help
us
said
ozma
hopefully
but
here
s
the
sign
board
what
shall
we
write
how
shall
i
begin
asked
the
scarecrow
dipping
the
brush
into
a
can
of
green
paint
dear
ruggedo
i
should
say
not
said
dorothy
indignantly
then
i
shall
simply
say
sir
said
the
scarecrow
if
you
move
or
turn
or
shake
your
head
ten
eggs
will
be
from
the
windows
suggested
tik
tok
as
this
message
met
with
general
approval
the
scarecrow
set
it
down
with
many
flourishes
and
blotches
of
paint
spilled
between
then
ozma
painted
her
name
and
the
royal
seal
of
oz
at
the
end
meanwhile
with
the
help
of
a
pair
of
field
glasses
sir
hokus
had
located
ruggedo
s
nose
sticking
out
like
a
huge
cliff
below
the
middle
window
of
dorothy
s
room
so
tying
a
long
rope
to
each
corner
of
the
sign
and
rolling
it
up
so
it
would
go
through
the
window
the
knight
let
it
down
till
it
dangled
directly
in
front
of
ruggedo
s
nose
at
first
ruggedo
did
not
even
see
the
sign
which
was
about
as
large
as
the
tiniest
visiting
to
him
but
it
blew
against
his
face
and
tickled
his
cheek
he
tried
to
brush
it
away
then
suddenly
noticing
it
was
dangling
from
above
he
seized
it
in
one
hand
and
held
it
close
to
his
left
eye
the
words
were
so
small
for
a
giant
that
ruggedo
had
to
squint
fearfully
before
he
could
make
them
out
at
all
but
when
he
did
he
gave
a
bloodcurdling
scream
and
began
to
tremble
violently
illustration
ruggedo
gave
a
bloodcurdling
scream
and
began
to
tremble
violently
up
in
the
palace
the
entire
company
fell
over
and
twenty
windows
were
shaken
to
bits
then
everything
grew
quiet
and
there
was
perfect
silence
for
ruggedo
realizing
his
danger
grew
rigid
with
fright
giant
drops
of
perspiration
trickled
down
his
forehead
how
long
could
he
keep
from
moving
well
said
dorothy
after
a
few
minutes
had
passed
i
guess
that
will
keep
him
quiet
but
what
next
shall
we
let
ourselves
down
with
ropes
we
have
none
long
enough
said
sir
hokus
then
i
ll
fall
out
and
go
for
help
said
the
scarecrow
brightly
and
started
toward
the
window
when
he
reached
it
he
paused
in
astonishment
look
he
cried
waving
excitedly
to
the
others
here
comes
someone
walking
right
over
the
illustration

chapter
the
sand
man
takes
a

someone
was
coming
toward
the
palace
a
little
old
surprisingly
quick
and
nimble
old
from
cloud
to
cloud
and
pausing
now
and
then
to
straighten
a
huge
sack
he
carried
over
his
left
shoulder
he
was
so
busy
admiring
the
lovely
sky
colors
behind
him
and
waving
merrily
at
the
fluffy
cloud
figures
above
his
head
that
he
did
not
see
ozma
s
shining
palace
until
he
was
almost
upon
it

murmured
the
little
old
gentleman
balancing
perilously
on
the
very
edge
of
a
silver
cloud
another
air
castle
how
delightful
i
shall
jump
right
through
it
gathering
himself
together
he
leaped
straight
toward
the
window
out
of
which
dorothy
and
ozma
and
the
others
were
looking
with
a
soft
thud
he
struck
the
emerald
setting
just
above
the
window
and
down
tumbled
his
sack
opening
as
it
fell
and
filling
the
air
with
clouds
of
silver
sand
down
tumbled
the
little
old
gentleman
turning
over
and
over
and
finally
landing
on
a
blankety
white
cloud
far
below
all
of
this
dorothy
saw
and
was
about
to
ask
ozma
what
it
could
mean
when
an
overpowering
drowsiness
stole
over
her
before
she
could
speak
her
eyes
closed
and
she
sank
backward
into
a
big
arm
chair
trot
and
betsy
bobbin
with
two
little
sighs
crumpled
down
to
the
floor
the
head
of
sir
hokus
dropped
heavily
on
the
sill
and
not
even
in
pokes
had
he
snored
so
lustily
ozma
slipped
gently
down
beside
betsy
and
trot
and
in
a
moment
there
was
not
a
person
awake
in
that
whole
big
palace
even
the
little
mice
in
the
kitchen
were
fast
asleep
with
heads
on
their
paws
did
i
say
everyone
well
not
quite
everyone
had
fallen
under
the
strange
spell
tik

scraps
and
the
scarecrow
who
had
never
slept
in
their
lives
were
still
wide
awake
and
regarding
their
companions
with
astonishment
and
alarm
the
tin
woodman
was
taking
things
calmly
oiling
up
his
joints
and
polishing
his
tin
jacket
with
silver
polish
this
is
no
time
to
sleep
cried
the
scarecrow
shaking
sir
hokus
i
up
but
all
their
efforts
to
arouse
their
companions
were
in
vain
said
the
copper
man
with
a
click
and
a
whirr
tik
tok
s
machinery
ran
down
and
as
scraps
and
the
scarecrow
were
too
upset
to
think
of
winding
him
he
stood
as
silent
and
dumb
as
the
rest
what
shall
we
do
cried
the
scarecrow
seizing
scraps
arm
jump
out
of
the
window
and
go
for
help
or
stay
here
and
guard
the
palace

looked
out

here
shuddered
the
patch
work
girl
drawing
in
her
head
quickly
then
said
the
scarecrow
let
us
arm
ourselves
and
prepare
to
withstand
any
he
snatched
up
a
pair
of
fire
tongs
and
scraps
grasped
the
poker
falling
into
step
the
two
marched
from
the
top
to
the
bottom
of
the
palace
everywhere
the
same
sight
met
their
gaze
rooms
turned
topsy
turvy
and
spread
over
floors
and
sofas
and
chairs
the
sleeping
figures
of
ozma
s
once
lively
courtiers
and
servants
the
effect
was
so
distressing
that
scraps
and
the
scarecrow
found
themselves
whispering
and
treading
about
on
after
inspecting
the
whole
palace
they
returned
to
dorothy
s
room
and
placed
themselves
disconsolately
in
the
doorway
anyway
ruggedo
is
quiet
sighed
the
scarecrow
and
that
is
scraps
started
to
make
a
verse
but
the
silence
and
the
ghostlike
atmosphere
of
the
sleeping
palace
had
dashed
even
the
spirits
of
the
patch
work
girl
and
she
subsided
with
an
indistinct
mumble
ruggedo
was
silent
for
a
very
good
reason
ruggedo
was
asleep
sitting
up
as
stiff
as
a
stone
image
for
even
in
his
sleep
he
dreamed
of
the
dreaded
bombardment
of
eggs
all
this
had
happened
because
the
little
man
in
gray
had
taken
ozma
s
palace
for
an
air
castle
and
who
could
blame
him
for
that
even
the
sand
man
would
not
expect
to
find
a
regular
palace
set
among
the
clouds
there
are
plenty
of
dream
castles
to
be
sure
and
one
of
the
sand
man
s
chief
delights
is
to
jump
through
them
and
admire
their
lovely
furniture
but
little
fellow
could
not
get
over
it
sitting
on
the
white
cloud
which
floated
close
to
ruggedo
s
head
he

asked
kabumpo
squinting
down
his
long
trunk
at
peg
amy
she
had
begged
him
to
take
off
his
plush
robe
and
spreading
it
on
the
grass
was
beating
it
briskly
with
the
branch
of
a
tree
yes
sighed
the
wooden
doll
pausing
with
uplifted
stick
and
regarding
kabumpo
solemnly
i
must
have
been
alive
before
cause
i
keep
remembering
what
kind
of
things
asked
the
elegant
elephant
rubbing
himself
lazily
against
a
tree
well
this
for
instance
said
peg
holding
up
a
corner
of
the
purple
plush
robe
i
once
had
a
dress
of
it
i
m
sure
i
had
a
dress
of
this
when
you
were
a
little
doll
asked
kabumpo
curiously
no
said
peg
giving
the
robe
a
few
little
shakes
before
that
and
i
remember
this
country
too
and
the
sun
and
the
wind
and
the
sky
if
i
d
only
been
alive
one
day
i
wouldn
t
remember
them
would
i
queer
things
happen
in
oz
said
kabumpo
comfortably
but
why
bother
you
are
alive
and
very
jolly
you
are
traveling
with
the
most
elegant
elephant
in
oz
and
in
the
company
of
a
prince
isn
t
that
enough
peg
amy
did
not
reply
but
kept
on
beating
the
plush
robe
with
determined
little
thumps
and
staring
off
through
the
trees
with
a
very
puzzled
expression
in
her
painted
blue
eyes
they
had
traveled
swiftly
all
morning
through
the
fertile
farmlands
of
the
winkies
and
had
paused
for
lunch
in
this
little
grove
peg
not
needing
food
and
kabumpo
finding
plenty
of
tender
branches
handy
had
remained
together
while
wag
and
the
prince
sought
more
nourishing
fare
many
a
little
winkie
farmer
had
stared
in
amazement
as
peg
and
pompa
passed
that
morning
but
so
fast
did
kabumpo
and
wag
travel
that
before
the
winkies
were
half
sure
of
what
they
had
seen
there
was
nothing
but
a
cloud
of
dust
to
wonder
over
and
exclaim
about
if
you
had
a
pair
of
scissors
i
could
cut
off
the
burned
part
of
your
robe
and
make
it
more
tidy
said
peg
when
she
had
finished
beating
the
dust
out
of
kabumpo
s
gorgeous
blanket
there
might
be
a
pair
in
my
pocket
said
the
elegant
elephant
here
let
me
get
them
he
added
hastily
for
suppose
she
should
look
into
the
magic
mirror
he
thought
suddenly
it
might
tell
her
something
terrible
even
in
this
short
time
kabumpo
had
grown
fond
of
queer
wooden
peg
and
careless
as
he
was
somehow
he
did
not
want
to
hurt
her
feelings
again
sure
enough
there
was
a
pair
of
silver
scissors
in
with
the
jewels
he
had
tumbled
into
his
pocket
before
leaving
pumperdink
so
peg
carefully
cut
away
all
the
scorched
part
of
kabumpo
s
robe
and
pinned
under
the
rough
edges
with
three
beautiful
pearl
pins
now
lift
me
up
into
that
small
tree
and
i
ll
drop
it
over
you
she
laughed
gaily
this
kabumpo
did
quite
easily
and
after
peg
amy
had
smoothed
and
adjusted
the
robe
she
crept
out
on
the
end
of
the
branch
and
straightened
the
elegant
elephant
s
pearl
head
dress
and
brushed
all
the
dust
from
his
forehead
with
a
handful
of
damp
leaves

kabumpo
swung
her
down
from

tree
and
awkwardly
peg
amy
clasped
the
chain
about
her
wooden
neck
then
she
flung
both

round
kabumpo
s

biggest

old

peg
happily
kabumpo
blinked
he
was
accustomed
to
being
called
elegant
and
magnificent
but
no
even
ever
called
him
an
old
darling
before
and
he
found
he
liked
it
immensely
while
peg
ran
to
look
at
her
reflection
in

small
pool
he
resolved
to
get
the
wooden
doll
a

at

for
in

of
her
stiff
fingers
peg
was
very
deft
and
clever
and
she
shall
have
a
purple
plush
dress
too
said
kabumpo
grandly
just
then
pompa
and
wag
returned
in
a
high
good
humor
the
prince
had
tapped
on
the
door
of
a
small
farm
house
and
the
little
winkie
lady
had
been
most
hospitable
not
only
had
she
given
the
prince
all
he
could
eat
but
she
had
allowed
wag
to
go
into
the
garden
and
pick
two
dozen
of
her
best
cabbages
his
size
had
greatly
astonished
her
and
she
had
insisted
upon
measuring
him
twice
with
her
yellow
tape
measure
but
finally
without
revealing
the
purpose
of
their
journey
the
two
managed
to
get
away
as
all
were
now
refreshed
and
rested
they
decided
to
start
on
again
we
ought
to
reach
ev
by
evening
puffed
wag
between
hops
but
i
wish
we
could
open
the
magic
box
sighed

holding
on

kabumpo

what
else
was
in
the

peg
it
was
hard
to

while
they
were
being
jolted
along
but
peg
being
of
wood
did
not
feel
the
bumps
and
pompa
being
a

pretended
not
to
so
that
they
continued
their
conversation
in
jerky
sentences
there
s
vanishing
cream
a
little
tea
kettle
and
some
kind
of
rays
and
a

said
peg
holding
up
her
wooden

a
question
box
that
answers
any

exclaimed
kabumpo
stopping
short
well
i
wish
we
could
ask
it
whether
pumperdink
has
and
how
to
rescue
ozma
and
who
sent
the
scroll
cried
pompa
oh
do
let
me
try
to
open

so
peg
handed
over

s
magic
box
and
as
they
pounded
along
the
prince
tried
to
pry
it
open
with
his
pearl
pen

it
would
save
us
such
a

of
trouble
he
murmured
holding

up
and
screwing
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
better
let
it
alone
advised
wag
wiggling
his
ears
nervously

you
should
grow
as
big
for
you
as
i
am
for
me
suppose
you
should
explode
or

coughed
kabumpo

grump
put

away

wait
till
we
reach

make
that
wicked
little

open
it

us
who
is
this

anyway
a

ozma

you
why
i

he

you

kabumpo

hopped
close

peg
kept
her
eyes

imaginable
illustration

i

brush

then
perhaps
ozma
will
say
when
he
tells
her
his
story
and
asks
for
her
hand

i
wonder
what
will
become
of
me
peg
sighed
ever
so
softly
and
looked
down
with
distaste
at
her
wooden
hands
and
torn
old
dress
nothing
very
exciting
could
happen
to
a
shabby
wooden
doll
why
i
haven
t
even
any
right
to
be
alive
she
reflected
sadly
i
m
only
meant
to
be
funny
well
never
mind
perhaps
i
can
help
pompa
and
maybe
that
s
why
i
was
brought
to
this
thought
and
the
gleam
of
the
lovely
pearls
kabumpo
had
given
her
so
cheered
peg
that
she
began
to
hum
a
queer
squeaky
little
song
the
country
was
growing
rougher
and
more
hilly
every
minute
the
sunny
farmlands
lay
far
behind
them
now
and
as
peg
finished
her
song
they
came
to
the
edge
of
a
queer
forest
the
trees
were
dry
and
without
leaves
and
there
were
quantities
of
stiff
bushes
and
short
stunted
little
trees
standing
under
the
taller
ones
peg
had
an
odd
feeling
that
hundreds
of
eyes
were
staring
out
at
them
but
the
forest
was
so
dim
that
she
couldn
t
be
sure
there
was
not
a
sound
but
the
crackling
of
the
dead
branches
under
wag
s
and
kabumpo
s
feet
i
don

like
this
choked
wag
my
wocks

it

oh
look
wag
that
big
tree
has
eyes
at

s
remark
the
tree
doubled
up
its
branches
into
fists
and
stepped
right
out
in

of
them
at
the

instant
all
the
other

all

over
and
seized

up
on

at

the
ugly

out

the

gormish
whispered
peg
uneasily
to

before

could
answer
the
twigs

had
decided
not

made
a
rush
upon
the
travelers
but
kabumpo
was
ready
for
them
with
uplifted
trunk
with
a
furious
trumpet
he
charged
straight
into
the
middle
wag
at
his
heels
with
the
result
that
the
twigs
went
crackling
and
snapping
to
the
ground
in
heaps

screeched
scornfully
as
he
flung
the

twig
out
of
his
way

wag
and
he
never
stopped
till
they
had
put
a
good
mile
between
themselves

the
disagreeable
pinchers

you
hurt
asked
kabumpo
stopping
at

and
looking
around
at

if
we
keep
on
this
way
you
won

fit
to

lifted
the
prince
down

and
eyed
him
with
consternation
the

had
seven
long
scratches
on
his
cheek
and
his
velvet
cloak
was
torn
to
ribbons
i

added
taking

and
regarding
it
ruefully

smiled
at

and
made
her
his
best
bow

kabumpo
still
looked
anxious

so
smart
as
you

he
sighed
gloomily
but
come
along
the
main
thing
is
to

ozma
and
after
that
perhaps
she
won
t
notice
your
scratches

finished
more
hopefully
with
a
few
more
of

after

meeting
the
runaway
country
everything
was
mixed
up
indeed
moving
toward
the
little
party
of
rescuers
was
a
huge
jagged
piece
of
land
running
along
on
ten
tremendous
feet
and
feeling
its
way
with
its
long
wiggly
peninsula
the
feet
raised
it
several
yards
above
the
ground
if
we
crouch
down
maybe
it
will
run
over
us

shrilled
wag
beginning
to
hop
in
a
frenzied
circle
stop
cried
the
land
in
a
loud
voice
as
wag
and
kabumpo
started
to
run
better
stop
puffed
kabumpo
his
eyes
rolling
wildly
or
it

probably
fall
on
trembling
in

they
stood
still
and
waited
for

i
ve
often
heard
of
sailors
hailing
land
with
joy
gulped
wag
but
how
did
it
get
this
way
as
the
runaway
country
drew
nearer
its
peninsula
fairly
quivered
with
excitement
and
as
it
reached
them
it
pulled
up
its
front
feet
and
tilted
forward
to
get
a
better
view
its
eyes
were
two
small
blue
lakes
and
its
mouth
a
broad
bubbling
river
i
claim
you
by
right
of
discovery
cried
the
land
in
its
loud
river
voice
and
before
they
could
make
any
objection
it
scooped
them
up
neatly
and
tossed
them
on
a
little
hill
this
is
outrageous
spluttered
the
elegant
elephant
picking
peg
out
of
some
bushes
we
ve
been
kidnapped
let
s
jump
off
cried
wag
beginning
to
hop
toward
the
edge
i
wouldn
t
do
that
said
the
land
calmly
because
i
d
only
run
after
you
again
you
might
as
well
settle
down
and
grow
up
with
me
i
m
not
such
a
bad
little
country
it
added
quietly
just
a
bit
rough
and
well
what
s
that
got
to
do
with
us
demanded
kabumpo
staring
the
country
right
in
its
we
re
on
an
important
mission
and
we
haven
t
time
for
this
sort
of
thing
at
it
s
a
matter
of
saving
a
princess
cried
pompa
impulsively
couldn
t
you
let
someone
else
save
her
said
the
country
indifferently
beginning
to
move
off
sideways
like
a
crab
you
re
the
first
savages
i
ve
found
and
i
m
going
to
keep
you
not
that
you
re
what
i
d
pick
out

continued
ungraciously
that
wooden
girl
looks
uncommonly
odd
and
you
two
beasts
are
even
queerer
but
i
m
liberal
i
am
and
the
boy
looks
all
right
so
far
as
i
can
but

panted
wag
twitching
his

very
fast
this
is
all

isn

you

no

we

put
us
off

said
the
runaway
country
gruffly
and
i

shrilled
warningly
remember
i
m
a

rough
you
re
the
wildest
country
i
ever
saw
groaned
the
elegant
elephant
falling
up
against
a
tree
and
of
all
ridiculous
happenings
this
is
the
worst
never
mind
whispered
peg
amy
standing
on
her
tip
toes
to
whisper
in
kabumpo
s
huge
ear
it
s
taking
us
in
the
right
direction
and
maybe
if
we
were
very
go
ahead
and
try
it
wheezed
kabumpo
rolling
his
eyes
i
m
too
he
hugged
the
tree
again
so
peg
climbed
to
the
top
of
the
little
hill
and
waving
her
wooden
arms
to
attract
the
country
s
attention
called
cheerfully
yoho
land
where
are
you
going
illustration
unlabelled
at
first
the
land
only
blinked
his
blue
sulkily
but
as
peg
paid
no
attention
to
his
ill
temper
and
began
making
him
pretty
compliments
on
his
mountains
and
trees
he
gradually
cheered
up
i
m
going
to
be
an
island
he
announced
finally
that
s
where
i
m
going
i
m
tired
of
being
a
hot
dry
old
undiscovered
plateau
and
i
don
t
intend
to
stop
till
i
come
to
the
nonestic
oh
groaned
wag
falling
over
backwards
we
re
going
to
be
cast
away
on
a
desert
peg
held
up
a
warning
finger
what
made
you
want
to
run
away
and
be
an
island
she
asked
faintly
for
even
to
peg
things
looked
serious
well
began
the
land
giving
itself
a
hitch
i
lay
patiently
for
years
and
years
waiting
to
be
discovered
nobody
even
one
little
missionary
i
kept
getting
lonelier
and
lonelier
you
see
how
broken
up
i
am
yes
we
can
see
that
all
right
sniffed
kabumpo
and
i
m
ambitious
continued
the
country
huskily
i
want
to
be
cultivated
and
built
up
like
other
kingdoms
so
one
day
i
made
up
my
mind
i
wouldn
t
wait
any
longer
but
would
run
off
myself
and
discover
some
settlers
as
i
have
ten
mountains
and
each
has
a
foot
there
seemed
to
be
no
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
run
away
so
i
i
the
country
rolled
its
lakes
triumphantly
at
the
little
party
on
the
hill
i
have
found
some
settlers
and
i
m
looking
to
you
to
develop
me
into
a
good
modern
kingdom
i
m
a
progressive
country
and
i
expect
you
to
improve
and
make
something
out
of
me
it
continued
earnestly
there
s
gold
to
be
dug
out
of
my
mountains
plenty
of
good
farm
land
to
be
planted
and
cities
to
be
built
what
do
you
think
we
are
exploded
kabumpo
indignantly
slaves
he
ll
get
used
to
it
in
time
said
the
runaway
country
paying
no
attention
to
kabumpo
and
he
ll
be
useful
for
drawing
logs
now
you
he
turned
his
watery
eyes
full
on
peg
amy
you
seem
to
be
the
most
sensible
one
in
the
party
so
i
think
i
shall
bestow
myself
upon
you
of
course
you
re
not
at
all
handsome
nor
regular
but
from
now
on
you
may
consider
yourself
a
princess
and
as
your
thank
you
thank
you
very
much
said

amy
hardly
knowing
what
else
to
say
hurrah
for
the
princess
of
runaway
island
cried
wag
standing
on
his
head
i
always
knew
you
were
a
princess
peg
my
oh
hush
whispered
pompa
can
t
you
see
it
s
getting
more
reasonable
maybe
peg
can
persuade
it
to
if
it
doesn
t
stop
soon
i
ll
tear
all
its
trees
out
by
the
roots
grumbled
kabumpo
under
his
breath
logging
indeed
great
grump
here
s
the
deadly
desert
the
air
was
now
so
hot
and
choking
that
pompa
flung
himself
face
down
on
the
cool
grass
the
runaway
country
did
not
seem
to
notice
the
burning
sands
and
pattered
smoothly
along
on

ten
mountain
feet

something
has
to

clasping
her
hands
for
soon
we
ll
be
in
pompa
holding
his
silk
handkerchief
before
his
face
had
come
up
beside
her
and
they
both
looked
anxiously
for
the
first
signs
of
the
country
that
held
ruggedo
and
the
giant
who
had
run
off
with
ozma
s
palace
oh
land
called
peg
suddenly
yes
princess
answered
the
country
without
slackening
its
speed
have
you
thought
about
feeding
us
asked
the
wooden
doll
gently
i
don
t
see
any
fruit
trees
or
vegetables
or
chickens
and
settlers
must
eat
you
know
we
ought
to
have
some
seeds
to
plant
and
some
building
materials
oughtn
t
we
if
we
re
going
to
make
you
into
an
country
pshaw
said
the
runaway
country
stopping
with
a
jolt
i
never
thought
of
that
can
t
you
eat
grass
and
fish
there
s
fine
fish
in
my
well
i
don
t
eat
at
all
explained
peg
pleasantly
but
pompa
is
a
prince
and
a
prince
has
to
have
meat
and
vegetables
and
puddings
on
and
i
have
to
have
lettuce
and
carrots
and
cabbages
or
i
won

work
cried
wag
thumping
with
his
hind
feet
and
winking
at
kabumpo
i
ll
not
dig
a
single
mountain
and
i
ve
got
to
have
my
ton
of
hay
a
day
too
trumpeted
the
elegant
elephant
or
i
ll
not
lug
a
single
log
pretty
poor
sort
of
a
country
you
are
expecting
us
to
live
on
grass
as
if
we
were
donkeys
and
the
runaway
country
rolled
its
lakes
helplessly
from
one
to
the
other
i
thought
settlers
always
managed
to
get
a
living
off
the
land
it
murmured
in
a
troubled
voice
not
us
rumbled
kabumpo
not
enough
pie
in
pioneer
to
suit
this
party
has
your
highness
anything
to
suggest
asked
the
country
looking
anxiously
at
peg
well
said
the
wooden
doll
slowly
suppose
we
stop
at
the
first
country
we
come
to
and
stock
up
we
could
get
a
few
chickens
and
seeds
and
saws
and
hammers
and
you
d
run
away
said
the
runaway
country
suspiciously
not
but
what
i
trust
you
princess
he
added
hastily
but
he
scowled
darkly
at
kabumpo
and
wag
i
ll
not
let
them
out
of
my
how
our
little
floating
island
loves
us
chuckled
wag
nudging
the
elegant

they
won
t
run
away
said
peg
softly
and
if
they
did
you
could
easily
catch
them
that
s
so
i
ll
stop
wherever
you
say
sighed
the
country
starting
on
again
what
are
you
going
to
do
whispered
pompa
catching
peg
s
arm
i
don

peg
honestly
but
perhaps
if

can
make
it
stop
something
will
turn
up

and
that

gratefully
how
can

your

said
peg
practically
for
we
may
run
into
that
giant
any

kabumpo
and
wag
had
stopped
making
jokes
and
were
straining
their
eyes
toward
ev
let
s
all
stand
together
gasped
wag
breathlessly
before
peg
or
pompa
had
time
to
plan
or
kabumpo
to
reply
the
runaway
country
stepped
off
the
desert
and
swept
over
the
border
and
into
the
kingdom
of
ev
making
straight
for
a
tall
purple
mountain
do
you
see
anything
that
looks
like
a
giant
or
a
palace
asked
peg
leaning
forward
oh
help
screamed
wag
just
then
while
kabumpo
gave
an
earsplitting
trumpet
peg
grasped
pompa
and
pompa
clutched
peg
and
no
wonder
directly
in
front
of
them
were
the
legs
and
feet
of
the
most
terrible
and
tremendous
giant
they
had
ever
imagined
he
was
sitting
on
the
mountain
itself
and
only
a
part
of
him
was
visible
for
his
head
and
shoulders
were
lost
in
the
clouds

kabumpo
gave
an
trumpet
what

the
matter
what

rumbled
the
runaway
country
tilting
forward
slightly
so
it
could
see
one
look
was
enough
with
a
frightened
jump
that
sent
the
four
travelers
hurtling
through
the
air
it
began
running
backwards
and
in
a
moment
was
out

peg
was
the
first
to
recover
her
senses

rose
stiffly
and
gazed
around

feet
were
waving
feebly
from
a
small
clump
of
bushes
kabumpo
stood
swaying
near
by
while

lay
over
on
his
side
with
closed
eyes
oh
you
poor
dears
murmured
peg
and
running
over
to
the
bushes
she
pulled
out
the
prince
of
pumperdink
and
settled
him
with
his
back
against
a
tree
he
was
much
shaken
by
his
high
dive
from
the
island
but
pulled
himself
together
and
patted
peg

wooden
hand
kindly
by
this

kabumpo
had
gotten
his

himself
all
over
with

caught
another
glimpse
of
those
dreadful
giant
feet
i

kabumpo

in

now
that

he

that
he
never

brought
him
up

at

sharply
to

shuddered
kabumpo
glancing
fearfully
in
the
direction
of
the
mountain
the
scarecrow
nodded
vigorously
and
told
in
a
few
words
of
their
terrible
journey
to
ev
and
their
present
perilous
position
how
the
palace
had
gotten
on
ruggedo

he
admitted
was
a
puzzle
to
him
kabumpo
and
pompadore
listened
with
amazement
especially
to
the
part
where
they
had
threatened
ruggedo
with
eggs
and
he
s
kept
still
for
two
days
just
on
account
of
eggs
gasped
the
elegant
elephant
incredulously
well
no
admitted
the
scarecrow
wrinkling
up
his
forehead
a
little
man
came
flying
through
the
air
the
first
morning
and
bumped
into
the
palace
and
instantly
everyone
except
scraps
and
me
fell
asleep
ruggedo
was
put
to
sleep
too
we
could

how

and
waken
a
sleeping
princess
but
the
scarecrow
shook
his
head
a
few
minutes
before
i
fell
out
they
began
to
wake
up
and
i
d
just
gone
to
the
window
to
look
for
glinda
when
ruggedo
gave
a
howl
and
ducked
his
head
and
here
i
the
scarecrow
spread
his
hands
eloquently
and
smiled
at
peg
has
glinda
been
here
asked
kabumpo
jealously
yes
said
the
scarecrow
she
came
this
morning
and
she

been
trying
all
sorts
of
magic
to
reduce
ruggedo
without
harm
to
the
great
grump
do
you
hear
that
kabumpo
rolled
his

anxiously
toward
the

out
the

after
another
in
the
party
with
a
puzzled
expression
would
you
mind
telling
me
how
you
happened
to
know
about
the
palace
disappearing
how
you
got
across
the
sandy
desert
how
you
expect
to
help
us
how
he
with
a
jerk
at
wag
came
to
be
too
large
how
she
with
a
jerk
of
his
thumb
at
peg
came
to
be
alive
all
in
good
time
all

kabumpo
testily
you

the

indignantly
isn

he
shook
and
shook
peg
and
he
meddled
with
magic
and
blew
up
into
a
giant
he
s
run
off
with
the
palace
doesn
t
he
deserve
a
pounding
friend
said
the
scarecrow
i
admire
your
spirit
but
my
excellent
brains
tell
me
that
this
is
a
case
where
an
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
a
pound
of
cure
but
have
we

of

kabumpo

the

upon

asked
the

box
how
shall
we
save
the
lovely
princess
of
oz
these
maneuvers
so
astonished
the
scarecrow
that
he
lost
his
balance
and
fell
flat
on
his
nose
when
he
recovered
peg

clapping
her
wooden
hands
and
kabumpo
was
dancing
on
three
legs

my

cried
kabumpo
thumping
the
prince
upon
the
back
what
is
it
what

happened
gasped
the
scarecrow
why
the
question
box
says
to
pour
three
drops
of

tea
on

s
left
foot
and
two
on

and
he

then
march
back
to
the
emerald
city
descend
into

after

has
settled
firmly
on
its
foundations
he

holding

her

cried
the
scarecrow
throwing
up
his
hat
peggy
put
the
kettle
on
and
we
ll
all
have
some
tea
but
where
d
you
get
all
this
magic
stuff
he
asked
immediately
after
out
of
a
box
of
mixed
magic
puffed
kabumpo
his
little
eyes
twinkling
with
anticipation
as
he
watched
peg
first
she
filled
the
tiny
kettle
at
a
brook
then
she
lit
the
little
lamp
and
dropped
some
of
the
trick
tea
into
the
kettle
bright
pink
clouds
arose
from
the
kettle
as
soon
as
peg
had
set
it
over
the
flame
and
while
they
waited
for
it
to
boil
pompa
put
another
question
has
pumperdink
disappeared
asked
the
prince
in
a
trembling
voice
spelled
the
question
box
slowly
and
kabumpo
settled
back
with
a
great
sigh
of
relief
i
told
you
everything
would
be
all
right
if
you
followed
my
advice
said
the

elephant
stand
up
now
and
try
to
forget
your
black
eye
you
are
the
prince
of
pumperdink
and
i

elephant
of
but
why
all
the
ceremony
asked
the
scarecrow
looking
mystified
kabumpo
only
chuckled
to
himself
and
as
the
trick
tea
was
now
ready
peg
took
the
little
kettle
and
began
to

ruggedo
returns
to
the

the

on

where
does

pointed
a
trembling
paw
at
the

nose
twitching
so
fast
it

the

dismayed
by

of

though
the

of

has
lived
almost
a
thousand
years
she
is
no
older
than

would
no

almost
all

and
in

that
is
left
she
wants
to
play

enjoy
herself
like

little

for
ozma
is
only
a
little

fairy
after

i
m
not
going

anybody
she
declared
stoutly
then
because
she
really
was
touched
by
pompa
s
woebegone
appearance
she
asked
more
kindly
why
did
you
want
to
marry
me
especially
because
you
are
the
properest
princess
in
oz
groaned
the
prince
leaning
disconsolately
against
kabumpo
because
if
we
don
t
pumperdink
will
disappear
and
my
poor
old
father
and
my
mother
and
not
to
speak
of
us
gulped
the
elegant
elephant
but
where
is
pumperdink
and
who
said
it
would
disappear
asked
ozma
in
amazement
and
how
did
you
happen
to
have
this
trick
tea
and
come
to
rescue
me
the
prince
always
rescues
the
princess
he
intends
to

said
kabumpo
wearily
i
should
think
you
d
know
well
i
m
very
grateful
and
i
ll
do
anything
i
can
except
marry
you
exclaimed
ozma
who
was
beginning
to
feel
very
much
interested
in
this
strange
pair
thank
you
said
kabumpo
stiffly
for
he
was
deeply
offended
thank
you
but
we
must
be
going
come
along
don
t
be
a
gooch
this
time
it
was
pompa
who
spoke
i

going
to
tell
her
everything
and
pompa
being
as
i
have
told
you
before
the
most
charming
prince
in
the
world
made
ozma
a
comfortable
throne
of
green
boughs
and
throwing
himself
at
her
feet
poured
out
the
whole
story
of
their
adventures
beginning
with
the
birthday
party
and
the
mysterious
scroll
he
told
of
their
meeting
with
peg
amy
and
wag
and
ended
up
with
the
ride
upon
the
runaway
country
kabumpo
stood
by
swaying
sulkily
he
was
very
much
disappointed
in
the
princess
of

he
felt
that
she
had
no
proper
appreciation
of
his
or
pompa
s
importance
i
m
going

find

he
called
finally
she
s
got
more
sense
than
any
of
you
he
wheezed
under
his
breath
as
he
swept
grandly
out
of
sight
ozma
put
both
hands
to
her
head
as
pompa
finished
his
recital
and
really
it
was
enough
to
puzzle
any
fairy
scrolls
live
wooden
dolls
a
giant
rabbit
a
mysterious
magician
threatening
disappearances
and
ruggedo
s
wicked
use

cried
the
little
ruler
of

wish
the

would
come
back
he
s
so
clever
i
m
sure
he
could
help
us
but
first
you
had
better
bring
me
the
magic
pompa
rose
slowly
and
picking
up
all
the
little
flasks
and
boxes
that
had
spilled
out
when
wag
pounded
ruggedo
he
put
them
back
into
the
casket
and
handed
it
to
ozma
she
examined
the
contents
as
curiously
as
the
others
had
done
the
expanding
extract
was
the
only
thing
missing
for
ruggedo
had
poured
the
whole
bottle
over
his
head
the
question
box
seemed
to
ozma
the
most
wonderful
of
all
of
glegg
s
magic
why
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
ask
this
box
questions
she
cried
in
excitement
has
my
palace
reached
the
emerald
city
she
asked
breathlessly
shake
it
three
times
said
pompa
as
ozma
looked
in
vain
for
her
answer
yes
stated
the
box
after
the
third
shake
and
ozma
sighed
with
relief
i
suppose
you
asked
it
if
i
were
the
proper
princess
mentioned
in
the
scroll
she
said
a
bit
shyly
the
prince
shook
his
head
knew
without
asking
said
pompa
heavily
do
you
mean
to
say
you
never
asked
it
that
gasped
ozma
in
disbelief
why
i
am
surprised
at
and
before
pompa
could
object
she
shook
the
little
box
briskly
who
is
the
princess
that
pompa
must
marry
she
demanded
anxiously
the
princess
of
sun
top
mountain
flashed
the
question
box
promptly
then
as
an
afterthought
it
added
trust
the
mirror
and
golden
door
knob
now
you
see
cried
ozma
jumping
up
in
delight
i
wasn
t
the
proper
princess
at
all
pompa
smiled
faintly
but
without
enthusiasm
the
thought
of
hunting
another
princess
was
almost
too
much
i
wish
i
could
just
take
peg
amy
and
wag
and
go
back
to
pumperdink
without
marrying
anybody
he
choked
bitterly
now
don
t
give
up
advised
ozma
kindly
it
was
very
wrong
of
glegg
to
cause
you
all
this
trouble
i
m
going
to
keep
his
box
of
mixed
magic
and
take
away
all
his
powers
when
i
find
him
but
until
i
do
you
ll
have
to
follow
directions
oh
mercy
what
s
that
they
both
ducked
and
turned
around
in
a
hurry
as
a
terrific
thumping
sounded
behind
them
it
s
the
runaway
country
again
cried
pompa
seizing
ozma
s
hands
in
distress
and
it
s
caught
all
the
the
scarecrow
had
climbed
a
tree
and
was
waving
to
them
wildly
as
the
country
galloped
nearer
might
as
well
come
aboard
he
called
genially
this
is
a
fast
arguing
with
it
at
ozma
looked
helplessly
at
pompa
and
the
prince
had
only
time
to
grasp
her
more
firmly
when
the
country
scooped
them
neatly
into
the
air
down
they
tumbled
beside
peg
amy
and
wag
and
the
elegant
elephant
what
do
you
mean
by
this
demanded
ozma
as
soon
as
she
regained
her
breath
don
t
you
know
this
lady
is
the
ruler
of
all
oz
cried
pompa
warningly
peg
s
the
ruler
of
me
replied
the
country
calmly
i
nearly
lost
her
once
but
now
i
ve
caught
her
and
all
the
rest
and
i
am
not
going
to
stop
until
i
ve
reached
the
nonestic
or
no
ozma
had
been
somewhat
prepared
for
the
runaway
country
by
pompa
s
description
but
she
had
never
dreamed
it
would
dare
to
run
off
with
her
while
peg
amy
began
to
coax
it
to
stop
she
took
out
glegg
s
little
question
box
how
shall
i
stop
this
country
she
whispered
anxiously
spin
around
six
times
and
cross
your
fingers
directed
the
question
box
this
ozma
proceeded
to
do
much
to
the
agitation
of
the
scarecrow
who
thought
she
had
taken
leave
of
her
senses
but
next
instant
the
country
came
to
a
jolting
halt
peg
princess
peg
shrieked
the
island
i
am
bewitched
i
can
t
move
a
step
then
everybody
off
shouted
the
scarecrow
jerking
a
branch
of
a
tree
as
if
he
were
a
conductor
end
of
the
off
and
they
lost
no
time
tumbling
off
the
wild
little
country
it
seems
too
bad
to
leave
it
said
peg
amy
regretfully
picking
herself
up
it
threw
us
off
without
any
feeling
or
consideration
when
it
saw
ruggedo
sniffed
kabumpo
therefore
it
has
no
claims
on
us
but
couldn
t
you
do
something
for
it
asked
peg
approaching
ozma
timidly
it
s
so
tired
of
being
a
plateau
couldn
t
you
let
it
be
an
island
and
find
someone
to
settle
on
it
i
wouldn
t
mind
going
she
added
generously
you
shall
do
nothing
of
the
sort
cried
kabumpo
angrily
you
re
going
back
to
pumperdink
with
pompa
and
she
s
going
with
me
cried
wag
aren
t
you
peg
you
seem
to
be
a
very
popular
person
smiled
ozma
while
a
country
has
no
right
to
run
away
and
while
i
never
heard
of
one
doing
it
before
i
ve
no
objections
to
its
being
an
island
it
s
running
off
with
people
i
object
she
looked
the
country
sternly
in
its
but
i
can
t
move
screamed
the
country
tears
streaming
down
its
hill
and
i
ve
got
to
have
somebody
to
settle
oh
here
s
glinda
shouted
the
scarecrow
tossing
up
his
hat
now
we
shall
know
what
s
happened
to
leaving
the
country
for
a
moment
they
all
ran
to
welcome
the
good
sorceress
of
oz
glinda
s
reports
were
most
satisfactory
ruggedo
had
walked
straight
back
to
the
emerald
city
stepped
into
the
yawning
cavern
and
immediately
the
palace
had
settled
firmly
upon
its
old
foundations
then
had
come
a
muffled
explosion
and
when
glinda
and
dorothy
ran
through
the
secret
passage
which
had
been
discovered
meanwhile
by
the
soldier
with
the
green
whiskers
they
saw
ruggedo
shrunken
to
his
former
size
sitting
angrily
on
his
sixth
rock
of
history
i
have
locked
him
up
in
the
palace
finished
glinda
and
i
strongly
advise
your
highness
to
punish
him
ozma
sighed
what
would
you
do
she
asked
appealing
to
the
scarecrow
so
many
things
had
come
up
for
her
attention
and
advice
in
the
last
few
hours
that
the
little
fairy
ruler
felt
positively
dizzy
let
s
all
sit
down
in
a
circle
and
think
proposed
the
scarecrow
cheerfully
this
they
all
did
except
kabumpo
who
stood
off
glumly
by
himself
peg
was
looking
anxiously
at
pompadore
for
the
elegant
elephant
had
told
her
of
ozma
s
refusal
and
wondering
sadly
what
she
could
do
to
help
when
the
scarecrow
bounced
up
impulsively
i
have
it
chuckled
the
straw
man
let
s
send
ruggedo
off
on
the
runaway
country
he
deserves
to
be
banished
and
if
ozma
makes
the
country
an
island
he
can
do
no
here
ozma
had
to
stop
and
explain
to
glinda
about
the
country
that
wanted
to
be
an
island
and
after
a
short
consultation
they
decided
to
take
the
scarecrow
s
advice
just
as
soon
as
i
reach
the
emerald
city
i
ll
put
on
my
magic
belt
and
wish
him
onto
the
island
declared
ozma
and
i
think
we
d
better
go
right
straight
back
she
added
thoughtfully
for
it
s
growing
darker
every
minute
and
dorothy
will
be
anxious
to
hear
everything
that
s
now
you
tapped
pompadore
gently
on
the
you
must
start
at
once
for
sun
top
mountain
i
m
going
to
ask
the
question
box
just
where
it
pompa
sighed
deeply
and
when
ozma
consulted
the
question
box
as
to
the
location
of
sun
top
mountain
it
stated
that
this
kingdom
was
in
the
very
centre
of
the
north
winkie
country
that
s
fine
said
ozma
clapping
her
hands
i
ll
have
the
runaway
country
carry
you
over
the
deadly
desert
and
as
soon
as
you
have
married
the
princess
you
must
bring
her
to
see
me
in
the
emerald
what
s
all
this
demanded
kabumpo
pricking
up
his
ears
the
question
box
says
i
must
marry
the
princess
of
sun
top
mountain
said
pompa
getting
up
wearily
well
great
grump
why
couldn
t
it
have
said
so
before
asked
kabumpo
shrilly
you
never
asked
it
snapped
wag
twitching
his
nose
i
told
you
ozma
wasn
t
the
princess
mentioned
in
the
scroll
now
don
t
quarrel
begged
peg
amy
jumping
up
hastily
there
s
still
plenty
of
time
to
save
pumperdink
come
along
that
s
right
said
ozma
smiling
approvingly
at
peg
and
when
pompa
finds
his
princess
you
must
come
and
live
with
me
in
the
emerald
city
for
as
ruggedo
was
responsible
for
bringing
you
to
life
i
want
to
take
care
of
you
peg
amy
dropped
a
curtsey
and
promised
to
come
but
she
didn
t
feel
very
cheerful
about
it
then
as
ozma
was
anxious
to
get
back
to
the
emerald
city
they
all
hurried
to
runaway
country
you
are
to
take
these
travelers
across
the
deadly
desert
said
ozma
addressing
the
runaway
country
quite
sternly
and
you
are
to
set
them
down
in
the
winkie
country
if
you
do
this
i
will
restore
your
moving
power
again
and
give
you
a
little
gnome
for
king
then
you
may
run
off
to
the
nonestic
ocean
as
soon
as
ever
you
i
want

pouted
the
country
but
if
that
s
the
best
you
can
do
i
suppose
i
ll
have
to
stand
after
a
little
more
grumbling
it
agreed
to
ozma
s
terms
wearily
kabumpo
wag
peg
and
pompa
climbed
aboard
and
then
ozma
spun
around
six
times
in
the
opposite
direction
and
immediately
the
country
found
itself
able
to
move
again
called
ozma
as
she
and
the
scarecrow
jumped
into
glinda
s
chariot
and
good
luck
called
peg
waving
her
old
torn
bonnet
good
riddance
grumbled
the
country
gruffly
and
turning
sideways
began
running
toward
the
deadly
desert

to

by
what

did
ozma
take
that

wheezed
kabumpo
irritably
as
he
felt
in
his
pocket
to
see
whether
the
magic
articles
were
still
there
that
s
gratitude
for
you

it
make
groaned
pompa
stretching
out
upon

completely
exhausted
by

s
adventures

as
cross
as

i

gloomily
don

you
rumbled
the
elegant
elephant
with
a
sniff
ah

laughed
peg
that
doesn

sound
like
you
pompa
why
maybe
this
princess
will
be
so
lovely
you

want
to
carry

a

bore
said
wag
with
a
terrific
yawn
i
prefer
plain
folks
like
peg
and
the
you
re
all
hungry
that
s
what
s
the
matter
chuckled
the
wooden
doll
when
you
ve
had
some
supper
you
ll
be
just
as
anxious
to
find
the
princess
of
sun
top
mountain
as
you
were
to
find
ozma
here
s
the
winkie
country
now
and
there
s
a
star
for
good
peg
waved
toward
the
green
fields
with
one
hand
and
toward
the
clouds
with
the
other
it
was
dusk
now
and
just
one
star
twinkled
cheerily
in
the
sky
i
ll
set
you
down
but
i
m
not
going
away
said
the
runaway
country
determinedly
for
if
that
little
old
gnome
doesn
t
turn
up
i
m
going
to
catch
you
all
ozma
never
forgets
she
ll
keep
her
promise
said
peg
and
you
must
do
just
as
she
told
you
to
do
for
she
has
some
powerful
magic
and
can
send
you
right
back
to
where
you
came
can
she
gulped
the
country
anxiously
you
might
wait
a
while
though
suggested
pompa
darkly
after
i
ve
seen
this
new
princess
a
runaway
country
might
be
a
very
good
well
you
can
t
expect
her
to
marry
you
if
you
talk
that
way
said
peg
warningly
as
the
country
came
to
a
stop
in
a
huge
field
of
daisies
i
ll
wait
it
said
hopefully
as
the
four
travelers
swung
themselves
down
i
wonder
if
we
are
in
the
north
central
part
murmured
peg
amy
looking
around
anxiously
now
it
happened
the
country
had
crossed
the
deadly
desert
slantwise
and
although
none
of
the
party
knew
it
they
were
scarcely
a
mile
from
sun
top
mountain
i
see
a
garden
cried
wag
twitching
his
nose
hungrily
come
on
prince
let
s
find
some
with
head
down
and
dragging
his
feet
pompa
followed
wag
kabumpo
began
jerking
snappishly
at
some
tree
tops
and
peg
amy
sat
down
to
think
i
wish
thought
the
wooden
doll
looking
up
at
the
bright
star
i
wish
i
might
have
asked
the
box
one
little
peg
amy
looked
so
solemn
that
kabumpo
stopped
eating
and
regarded
her
anxiously
what
s
the
matter
asked
the
elegant
elephant
gruffly
for
he
quite
counted
on
peg
s
cheerfulness
i
was
thinking
about
it
again
admitted
peg
apologetically
about
being
alive
before
i
m
sure
i
was
alive
before
i
was
a
doll
kabumpo
i
think
i
was
a
person
like
pompa
she
continued
softly
you
re
much
better
as
you
are
said
the
elegant
elephant
uneasily
for
it
had
just
occurred
to
him
that
the
magic
mirror
would
tell
peg
who
she
was
as
well
as
the
question
box
but
should
he
let
her
look
in
it
that
was
the
question
poor
tired
old
kabumpo
shifted
from
one
foot
to
the
other
as
he
tried
to
make
up
his
mind
two
huge
drops
of
perspiration
ran
down
his
trunk
what
good
would
it
do
he
reasoned
finally
suppose
it
told
something
awful
it
couldn
t
change
her
and
it
might
make
her
unhappy
no
he
would
not
let
peg
look
in
the
mirror
how
would
you
like
to
have
this
pearl
bracelet
he
asked
in
an
embarrassed
voice
why
kabumpo
i
d
just
adore
it
cried
peg
springing
up
in
a
hurry
and
i
m
not
going
to
worry
about
being
alive
any
more
for
everyone
is
so
lovely
to
me
i
ought
to
be
the
happiest
person
in
you
are
puffed
kabumpo
clumsily
slipping
the
bracelet
on
peg
s
wooden
arm
and
if
we
ever
get
back
to
pumperdink
you
shall
have
as
many
silk
dresses
as
you
want
the
rest
of
the
sentence
was
smothered
in
a
hug
peg
amy
was
growing
fonder
and
fonder
of
pompous
old
kabumpo
and
by
the
time
he
had
recovered
his
breath
wag
and
the
prince
came
ambling
back
together
they
had
found
an
orchard
and
a
kitchen
garden
and
as
they
were
no
longer
hungry
both
were
more
cheerful
let
s
play

suggested

amiably
i
m
tired
of
hunting
there
was
a
smooth
patch
of
sand
under

hopped
over
and
began
marking
out
the
squares
with
his

gave
a
skip
of

wearily

about

no

kabumpo
opening

the
bird
put
its
head
on
one
side
and
regarded
them
anxiously
he
might
have
been
king
of
oz
instead
of
which
he
is
only
a
lost
prince
and
he
s
going
to
be
married

kabumpo
angrily

asked
the
hurrah
bird
looking
very
crestfallen
and
pointing
its
claw
at
peg

tell

the
way

kabumpo
not

look
at
my
nest
did

ever
see
a
hurrah
bird
s
nest
he
chirped
brightly
let

look
at
it
said
pompa
smiling
in
spite
of
himself
the
hurrah
bird
preened
itself
proudly
as
they
peered
through
the
bushes
surely
it
had
the
gayest
nest
ever
built
for
it
was
woven
of
straw
of
many
colors
and
hung
all
over
the
branches
were
small
oz
flags
in
the
nest
three
little
yellow
chicks
were
growing
up
into
hurrahs
and
they
chirped
faintly
at
the
visitors
remember
called
the
father
hurrah
as
they
bade
him
you
can
always
be
cheerful
in

chirps

the

kabumpo

to

there
s
a

to
be
learned
by

he
winked
at
the

him
let

how

the
elegant
elephant
began
to
plow
swiftly
through
the
daisy
field
so
that
in
almost
no
time
they
reached
the
top
of
the
little
hill
and
as
they
did
so
peg
gave
a
little
scream
of
delight
as
for
the
others
they
were
simply
speechless
a
purple
mountain
rose
steeply
ahead
and
set
like
a
crown
upon
its
summit
was
a
glittering
gold
castle
the
loveliest
laciest
gold
castle
you
could
imagine
with
a
hundred
fluttering
pennants
all
down

softly
but
no

her
pompa
drew
a
deep
breath
for
the
castle

the

in
a
shaking
voice
oh

wag
who
was
curious
to
see
the
owner

grand
a
castle
but
we
mustn

gasped

how
would
it
look
to
have
a
shabby
old
doll
tagging
along
when
he
s
trying
to
talk
to
the
princess

declared
pompa
stubbornly
you
re
just
as
good
as
any

said
kabumpo
and
i
m
not
going
without
you
as
the
elegant
elephant
refused
to
budge
and
there
seemed
no
other
way
out
of
it
peg
amy
finally
consented
and
the
four
adventurers
started
fearfully
up
the
winding
path
almost
expecting
the
castle
to
disappear
before
they
reached
the
top
so
unreal
did
it
seem
in
the
moonlight
there
was
no
one
in
the
garden
but
there
were
lights
in
the
castle
windows
just
as
if
they
expected

said
the
elegant
elephant
as
they
reached
the
tall
gates

opened
the

wag
his
eyes
sticking
out
with

becoming
more
agitated

kabumpo
held
up

had
brought
all
the

from

then
he
slipped
it
easily
on
the
small
gold
bar
projecting
from
the
door
but
instead
of
looking
joyful
pompa
groaned
dismally
he
started
to
protest
but
kabumpo
had
already
turned
the
knob
and
they
found
themselves
in

glittering
gold
court
room
now
for

princess
puffed
kabumpo
looking
around
with
his
twinkling
little
eyes
here
take
the

the
room
was
empty
although
brilliantly
lighted
and
the
prince
stood
uncertainly
in

very
center
suddenly
with
a
determined
little
cry
pompa
rushed
over
to

who
stood
leaning
against

stared

the

formed
in

somersault
the
big
rabbit

just
come
when
a
still
more
amazing
thing
happened
the
wooden
body
of

melted
before
their
eyes
and
in
its
place
stood
the
loveliest
little
princess
in
the
world
and
yet
with
all
her
beauty
she
was
strangely
like
the
old
peg
her
eyes

merry
twinkle

her

clasping
the

in

you

the

the

here

this
is

she
explained
quickly
and
impulsively
uncle

sprang
to
his
feet
and
embraced
each
in
kabumpo

down
begged
the
old
nobleman
sinking
into
a
golden
chair
and
mopping
his

with
a
flowered
silk
kerchief
pompa
who
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
this
new
and
wonderful
peg
amy
dropped
into
another
chair
kabumpo
leaned
limply
against
a
pillar
and
wag
sat
where
he
was
his
nose
twitching
faster
than
ever
and
his
ears
stuck
out
straight
behind
him
you
are
probably
wondering
about
the
change
in
peg
began
uncle
tozzyfog
as
the
princess
perched
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
so
i
ll
try
to
tell
my
part
of
the
story
three
years
ago
an
ugly
old
peddlar
climbed
the
path
to
sun
top
mountain
he
said
his
name
was
glegg
and
forcing
his
way
into
the
castle
he
demanded
the
hand
of
my
niece
in
peg
shuddered
and
uncle
tozzyfog
blew
his
nose
violently
at
the
distressing
memory
then
speaking
rapidly
and
pausing
every
few
minutes
to
appeal
to
the
princess
he
continued
the
story
of
peg
s
enchantment
naturally
the
old
peddlar
had
been
refused
and
thrown
out
of
the
castle
that
night
as
uncle
tozzyfog
prepared
to
carve
the
royal
roast
there
came
an
explosion
and
when
the
courtiers
had
picked
themselves
up
peg
amy
was
nowhere
to
be
seen
and
only
a
threatening
scroll
remained
to
explain
the
mystery
glegg
who
was
really
a
powerful
magician
infuriated
by
uncle
tozzyfog
s
treatment
had
changed
the
little
princess
into
a
tree
know
ye
began
the
scroll
quite
like
the
one
that
had
spoiled
pompa
s
birthday
know
ye
that
unless
ye
princess
of
sun
top
mountain
consents
to
wed
glegg
she
shall
remain
a
tree
forever
or
until
two
shall
call
and
believe
her
to
be
a
princess
the
whole
castle
had
been
plunged
into
utmost
gloom
by
this
terrible
happening
for
peg
was
the
kindliest
best
loved
little
princess
any
kingdom
could
wish
for
lord
tozzyfog
and
nearly
all
the
courtiers
set
out
at
once
to
search
for
the
little
tree
and
for
two
years
they
wandered
over
oz
addressing
every
hopeful
tree
as
princess
but
never
happening
on
the
right
one
finally
they
returned
in
despair
and
sun
top
mountain
once
the
most
cheerful
kingdom
in
all
oz
had
become
the
gloomiest
there
was
no
singing
nor
happiness
of
any
kind
even
the
flowers
had
drooped
in
the
absence
of
their
little
mistress
why
didn
t
you
appeal
to
ozma
demanded
pompa
at
this
point
in
the
story
because
in
another
scroll
glegg
warned
us
that
the
day
we
told
ozma
peg
amy
would
cease
to
even
be
a
tree
explained
uncle
tozzyfog
hoarsely
then
how
did
she
become
a
doll
tell
me
that
uncle
fozzytog
gulped
wag
raising
one
paw
she
ll
have
to
tell
you
that
herself
confessed
peg
s
uncle
for
that
s
all
of
the
story
i
so
here
peg
took
up
the
story
herself
the
morning
after
her
transformation
into
a
tree
glegg
had
appeared
and
asked
her
again
to
marry
him
i
was
a
little
yellow
tree
in
the
winkie
country
not
far
from
the
emerald
city
explained
peg
and
every
day
for
two
months
glegg
appeared
and
gave
me
the
power
of
speech
long
enough
to
answer
his
question
and
each
time
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
but
i
always
said
no
the
princess
shook
her
yellow
curls
briskly
illustration
every
day
glegg
returned
and
asked
me
to
marry
him
but
i
always
said
no
explained
peg
one
afternoon
there
came
a
sailor
man
and
a
little
even
kabumpo
shuddered
as
peg
amy
told
how
cap
n
bill
had
cut
down
the
little
tree
pared
off
all
the
branches
and
carved
from
the
trunk
a
small
wooden
doll
for
trot
it
didn
t
hurt
princess
peg
hastened
to
explain
as
she
caught
pompa
s
sorrowful
expression
and
being
a
doll
was
a
lot
better
than
being
a
tree
i
could
not
move
or
speak
but
i
knew
what
was
going
on
and
life
in
ozma
s
palace
was
cheerful
and
interesting
only
of
course
i
longed
to
tell
ozma
or
trot
of
my
enchantment
i
missed
dear
uncle
tozzyfog
and
all
the
people
of
sun
top
mountain
then
as
you
all
know
i
was
stolen
by
the
old
gnome
and
after
ruggedo
carried
me
underground
i
forgot
all
about
being
a
princess
and
remembered
nothing
of
peg
glanced
lovingly
around
the
room
i
only
felt
that
i
had
been
alive
before
so
you
peg
jumped
up
and
flung
one
arm
around
wag
and
you
she
flung
the
other
around
pompa
saved
me
by
calling
me
a
princess
and
really
believing
i
was
one
and
you
peg
hastened
over
to
kabumpo
who
was
rolling
his
eyes
sadly
you
are
the
darlingest
old
elephant
in
oz
see
i
still
have
the
necklace
and
bracelet
and
sure
enough
on
peg
s
round
arm
and
white
neck
gleamed
the
jewels
the
elegant
elephant
had
generously
given
when
he
thought
her
only
a
funny
wooden
doll
oh
groaned
kabumpo
why
didn
t
i
let
you
look
in
the
mirror
before
no
wonder
you
kept
remembering
but
why
did
glegg
send
the
threatening
scroll
to
pumperdink
three
years
after
he
d
enchanted
peg
asked
wag
scratching
his
head
because
shrilled
a
piercing
voice
and
in
through
the
window
bounded
a
perfectly
dreadful
old
man
it
was
glegg
himself
illustration
in
through
the
window
bounded
a
perfectly
dreadful
old
man
because
screeched
the
wicked
magician
advancing
toward
the
little
party
with
crooked
finger
when
that
meddling
old
sailor
touched
peg
with
his
knife
i
lost
all
power
over
her
because
my
question
box
told
me
that
pompadore
of
pumperdink
could
bring
about
her
disenchantment
and
he
has
i
made
it
interesting
for
you
didn
t
i
there
isn
t
another
magician
in
oz
can
put
scrolls
up
in
cakes
and
roasts
like
i
can
nor
mix
magic
like
mine
ha
ha
glegg
threw
back
his
head
and
rocked
with
enjoyment
you
have
had
all
the
trouble
and
i
shall
have
all
the
reward
everyone
was
so
stunned
by
this
terrible
interruption
that
no
one
made
a
move
as
glegg
sprang
toward
peg
amy
but
before
he
had
reached
the
princess
there
was
a
queer
sulphurous
explosion
and
the
magician
disappeared
in
a
cloud
of
green
smoke
they
rubbed
their
eyes
and
as
the
smoke
cleared
they
saw
trot
the
little
girl
who
had
played
with
peg
amy
when
she
was
a
wooden
doll
ozma
explained
trot
breathlessly
for
she
had
come
on
a
fast
illustration

after
following
the
adventures
of
pompa
and
peg
in
the
magic
mirror

as
the
magician
had

snatch
the

ozma
had
transported
him
by
means

her
magic
belt
to
the

sent
trot
to
bring
her
best
wishes
to
the
whole

sorry
i
didn

make
you
a
prettier
dress

you
were

hand
impulsively
but
you
see
i
didn

know
you
were
a
but
you
guessed
my
name
said
peg
softly
there
were
so
many
explanations
to
be
made
and
so
many
things
to
wonder
over
and
exclaim
about
that
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
never
stop
talking
uncle
tozzyfog
rang
all
the
bells
in
the
castle
tower
and
stepping
out
on
a
balcony
told
the
people
of
sun

return

then
the
servants
were
summoned
and
such
a
feast
as
only
an

can
prepare
was
started
in

castle
kitchen
the
courtiers
came
hurrying
back
for

came
back

poured
into

overwhelmed

their
thanks
kabumpo

never
been
so
admired

complimented
in
his
whole
elegant
life

for
wag
his
speech
grew
more
mixed
up
every
minute
at
last
when
the
courtiers
and
uncle
tozzyfog
had
run
off
to
dress
for
the
grand
banquet
and
after
trot
had
been
magically
recalled

well
how
about
pumperdink
my
boy
chuckled
kabumpo
with
a
wave
of
his
trunk
are
we
going
to
let
the
old
kingdom
disappear
or
not
it
is
my
duty
to
save
my
country
said
pompa
loftily
then
with
a
mischievous
smile
at
peg
amy
don
t
you
think
so
princess
peg
amy
looked
merrily
at
the
elegant
elephant
and
then
took
pompa
s
hand
yes
i
do
said
the
princess
of
sun
top
mountain
then
you
marry
me
asked
pompa
looking
every
inch
a
prince
in
spite
of
his
singed
head
and
torn
clothes
we
must
save
pumperdink
you
know
sighed
peg
softly
three
cheers
for
the
princess
of
pumperdink
may
she
be
as
happy
as
the
day
is
short
cried
wag
in
his
impulsive
way
uncle
tozzyfog
was
as
pleased
as
wag
when
he
heard
the
news
and
pompa
attired
in
a
royal
gold
embroidered
robe
was
married
to
peg
amy
upon
the
spot
with
much
pomp
and
magnificence
never
before
was
there
such
merrier
company
or
a
happier
bride
kabumpo
arrayed
in
two
gold
curtains
borrowed
for
the
happy
occasion
had
never
appeared
more
elegant
and
wag
was
everywhere
at
once
and
simply
overwhelmed
with
attention
that
same
night
a
messenger
was
dispatched
to
pumperdink
to
carry
the
good
news
and
the
next
morning
pompa
and
peg
set
out
for
the
emerald
city
the
princess
riding
proudly
on
wag
and
pompadore
on
kabumpo
knowing
the
whole
four
as
you
now
do
you
will
believe
me
when
i
say
that
their
journey
was
the
merriest
and
most
delightful
ever
recorded
in
the
merry
kingdom
of
oz
after
a
short
visit
with
ozma
and
another
to
the
king
and
queen
of
pumperdink
they
all
returned
to
sun
top
mountain
where
they
are
living
happily
at
this
very
minute

chapter
ruggedo
s
last
rock
there
are
only
a
few
more
mysteries
to
clear
up
before
we
leave
for
a
time
the
jolly
kingdom
of
oz
ruggedo
much
shaken
by
his
terrible
experiences
with
glegg
s
magic
confessed
everything
to
ozma
on
her
return
to
the
emerald
city
you
can
imagine
the
surprise
of
the
little
fairy
ruler
on
learning
how
her
palace
had
come
to
be
impaled
upon
the
spikes
of
the
wicked
old
gnome
s
gray
head
he
will
said
tik
tok
mournfully
as
ruggedo
finished
his
recital
the
bad
little
gnome
assured
ozma
that
he
had
reformed
and
begged
for
another
chance
but
this
time
ozma
knew
better
and
putting
on
her
magic
belt
she
whispered
a
few
secret
words
then
they
all
hurried
over
to
the
magic
picture
for
they
knew
that
ruggedo
had
been
transported
to
a
safe
place
at
last
the
picture
showed
the
runaway
country
rushing
along
faster
than
an
express
train
and
dancing
up
and
down
on
its
highest
hill
was
the
furious
old
king
of
the
gnomes
they
watched
until
the
country
plunged
joyfully
into
the
nonestic
ocean
and
when
it
was
almost
in
the
middle
ozma
stopped
it
by
the
magic
spinning
process
and
it
became
ruggedo
s
island
well
sighed
dorothy
as
they
turned
from
the
picture
i
guess
that
will
be
ruggedo
s
last
rock
he
s
rocked
in
the
cradle
of
the
deep
now
chuckled
the
scarecrow
and
i
hope
it
quiets
him
down
they
ought
to
make
a
good
bad
little
island
and
that
bad
little
king
he
added
reflectively

i
guess

ruggedo
s
last

said
dorothy
then
ozma
proposed
that
they
follow
the
adventures
of
peg
and
pompa
having
so
satisfactorily
disposed
of
ruggedo
how
she
transported
glegg
just
in
time
to
save
the
princess
you
already
know
but
what
happened
to
glegg
himself
is
interesting
when
the
old
magician
had
asked
his
question
box
how
to
regain
control
over
peg
again
it
had
directed
him
to
bury
his
mixed
magic
under
the
emerald
city
and
in
two
years
to
send
the
scroll
to
pumperdink
so
glegg
had
tunneled
out
the
cave
under
ozma
s
palace
and
left
his
magic
in
what
he
supposed
was
a
very
safe
place
it
had
been
a
great
hardship
to
do
without
it
for
two
years
but
he
wanted
peg
so
badly
that
he
actually
did
this
never
dreaming
that
ruggedo
had
moved
in
and
discovered
his
treasures
the
question
box
had
told
the
exact
day
peg
would
be
disenchanted
and
all
that
long
two
years
glegg
had
waited
hidden
in
a
forest
near
sun
top
mountain
as
he
knew
nothing
of
the
discovery
of
his
magic
box
no
one
was
more
surprised
than
he
to
find
himself
just
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
seizing
peg
transported
to
the
emerald
city
while
sir
hokus
of
pokes
held
the
struggling
glegg
ozma
asked
the
question
box
how
to
deal
with
him
everybody
crowded
around
the
little
fairy
ruler
to
hear
what
the
wicked
old
magician
s
fate
was
to
be
give
him
a
taste
of
his
own
magic
directed
the
question
box
make
him
drink
a
cup
of
his
triple
trick
this
ozma
did
although
it
took
fourteen
people
to
get
glegg
to
drink
it
but
stars
no
sooner
had
the
liquid
touched
his
lips
than
the
miserable
old
magician
went
off
with
a
loud
explosion

the
box
of

carefully
put
away
in
