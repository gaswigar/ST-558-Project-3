chapter
i
the
vanishing
man
the
school
of
margaret
hospital
was
fortunate
in
its
lecturer
on
medical
jurisprudence
or
forensic
medicine
as
it
is
sometimes
described
at
some
schools
the
lecturer
on
this
subject
is
appointed
apparently
for
the
reason
that
he
lacks
the
qualifications
to
lecture
on
any
other
but
with
us
it
was
very
different
john
thorndyke
was
not
only
an
enthusiast
a
man
of
profound
learning
and
great
reputation
but
he
was
an
exceptional
teacher
lively
and
fascinating
in
style
and
of
endless
resources
every
remarkable
case
that
had
ever
been
reported
he
appeared
to
have
at
his
fingers
ends
every
fact
chemical
physical
biological
or
even
historical
that
could
in
any
way
be
twisted
into
a
significance
was
pressed
into
his
service
and
his
own
varied
and
curious
experiences
seemed
as
inexhaustible
as
the
widow
curse
one
of
his
favorite
devices
for
giving
life
and
interest
to
a
rather
dry
subject
was
that
of
analyzing
and
commenting
upon
contemporary
cases
as
reported
in
the
papers
always
of
course
with
a
due
regard
to
the
legal
and
social
proprieties
and
it
was
in
this
way
that
i
first
became
introduced
to
the
astonishing
series
of
events
that
was
destined
to
exercise
so
great
an
influence
on
my
own
life
the
lecture
which
had
just
been
concluded
had
dealt
with
the
rather
unsatisfactory
subject
of
survivorship
most
of
the
students
had
left
the
theater
and
the
remainder
had
gathered
round
the
lecturer
table
to
listen
to
the
informal
comments
that
thorndyke
was
wont
to
deliver
on
these
occasions
in
an
easy
conversational
manner
leaning
against
the
edge
of
the
table
and
apparently
addressing
his
remarks
to
a
stick
of
blackboard
chalk
that
he
held
in
his
fingers
the
problem
of
survivorship
he
was
saying
in
reply
to
a
question
put
by
one
of
the
students
ordinarily
occurs
in
cases
where
the
bodies
of
the
parties
are
producible
or
where
at
any
rate
the
occurrence
of
death
and
its
approximate
time
are
actually
known
but
an
analogous
difficulty
may
arise
in
a
case
where
the
body
of
one
of
the
parties
is
not
forthcoming
and
the
fact
of
death
may
have
to
be
assumed
on
collateral
evidence
here
of
course
the
vital
question
to
be
settled
is
what
is
the
latest
instant
at
which
it
is
certain
that
this
person
was
alive
and
the
settlement
of
that
question
may
turn
on
some
circumstance
of
the
most
trivial
and
insignificant
kind
there
is
a
case
in
this
paper
which
illustrates
this
a
gentleman
has
disappeared
rather
mysteriously
he
was
last
seen
by
the
servant
of
a
relative
at
whose
house
he
had
called
now
if
this
gentleman
should
never
reappear
dead
or
alive
the
question
as
to
what
was
the
latest
moment
at
which
he
was
certainly
alive
will
turn
upon
the
further
question
he
or
was
he
not
wearing
a
particular
article
of
jewelry
when
he
called
at
the
relative
house
he
paused
with
a
reflective
eye
bent
upon
the
stump
of
chalk
he
still
held
then
noting
the
expectant
interest
with
which
we
were
regarding
him
he
resumed
the
circumstances
in
this
case
are
very
curious
in
fact
they
are
highly
mysterious
and
if
any
legal
issues
should
arise
in
respect
of
them
they
are
likely
to
yield
some
very
remarkable
complications
the
gentleman
who
has
disappeared
john
bellingham
is
a
man
well
known
in
archeological
circles
he
recently
returned
from
egypt
bringing
with
him
a
very
fine
collection
of
antiquities
some
of
which
by
the
way
he
has
presented
to
the
british
museum
where
they
are
now
on
view
and
having
made
this
presentation
he
appears
to
have
gone
to
paris
on
business
i
may
mention
that
the
gift
consisted
of
a
very
fine
mummy
and
a
complete
set
of
the
latter
however
had
not
arrived
from
egypt
at
the
time
when
the
missing
man
left
for
paris
but
the
mummy
was
inspected
on
the
fourteenth
of
october
at
bellingham
house
by
norbury
of
the
british
museum
in
the
presence
of
the
donor
and
his
solicitor
and
the
latter
was
authorized
to
hand
over
the
complete
collection
to
the
british
museum
authorities
when
the
arrived
which
he
has
since
done
from
paris
he
seems
to
have
returned
on
the
of
november
and
to
have
gone
direct
to
charing
cross
to
the
house
of
a
relative
a
hurst
who
is
a
bachelor
and
lives
at
eltham
he
appeared
at
the
house
at
twenty
minutes
past
five
and
as
hurst
had
not
yet
come
down
from
town
and
was
not
expected
until
a
quarter
to
six
he
explained
who
he
was
and
said
he
would
wait
in
the
study
and
write
some
letters
the
housemaid
accordingly
showed
him
into
the
study
furnished
him
with
writing
materials
and
left
him
at
a
quarter
to
six
hurst
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
and
before
the
housemaid
had
time
to
speak
to
him
he
had
passed
through
into
the
study
and
shut
the
door
at
six
when
the
dinner
bell
was
rung
hurst
entered
the
alone
and
observing
that
the
table
was
laid
for
two
asked
the
reason
thought
bellingham
was
staying
to
dinner
sir
was
the
housemaid
reply
bellingham
exclaimed
the
astonished
host
did
know
he
was
here
why
was
i
not
told
thought
he
was
in
the
study
with
you
sir
said
the
housemaid
on
this
a
search
was
made
for
the
visitor
with
the
result
that
he
was
nowhere
to
be
found
he
had
disappeared
without
leaving
a
trace
and
what
made
the
incident
more
odd
was
that
the
housemaid
was
certain
that
he
had
not
gone
out
by
the
front
door
for
since
neither
she
nor
the
cook
was
acquainted
with
john
bellingham
she
had
remained
the
whole
time
either
in
the
kitchen
which
commanded
a
view
of
the
front
gate
or
in
the
which
opened
into
the
hall
opposite
the
study
door
the
study
itself
has
a
french
window
opening
on
a
narrow
grass
plot
across
which
is
a
that
opens
into
an
alley
and
it
appears
that
bellingham
must
have
made
his
exit
by
this
rather
eccentric
route
at
any
rate
and
this
is
the
important
fact
he
was
not
in
the
house
and
no
one
had
seen
him
leave
it
after
a
hasty
meal
hurst
returned
to
town
and
called
at
the
office
of
bellingham
solicitor
and
confidential
agent
a
jellicoe
and
mentioned
the
matter
to
him
jellicoe
knew
nothing
of
his
client
return
from
paris
and
the
two
men
at
once
took
the
train
down
to
woodford
where
the
missing
man
brother
godfrey
bellingham
lives
the
servant
who
admitted
them
said
that
godfrey
was
not
at
home
but
that
his
daughter
was
in
the
library
which
is
a
detached
building
situated
in
a
shrubbery
beyond
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
here
the
two
men
found
not
only
miss
bellingham
but
also
her
father
who
had
come
in
by
the
back
gate
godfrey
and
his
daughter
listened
to
hurst
story
with
the
greatest
surprise
and
assured
him
that
they
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
john
bellingham
presently
the
party
left
the
library
to
walk
up
to
the
house
but
only
a
few
feet
from
the
library
door
jellicoe
noticed
an
object
lying
in
the
grass
and
pointed
it
out
to
godfrey
the
latter
picked
it
up
and
they
all
recognized
it
as
a
scarab
which
john
bellingham
had
been
accustomed
to
wear
suspended
from
his
there
was
no
mistaking
it
it
was
a
very
fine
scarab
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
fashioned
of
lapis
lazuli
and
engraved
with
the
cartouche
of
amenhotep
iii
it
had
been
suspended
by
a
gold
ring
fastened
to
a
wire
which
passed
through
the
suspension
hole
and
the
ring
though
broken
was
still
in
position
this
discovery
of
course
only
added
to
the
mystery
which
was
still
further
increased
when
on
inquiry
a
bearing
the
initials
j
was
found
to
be
unclaimed
in
the
at
charing
cross
reference
to
the
counterfoil
of
the
showed
that
it
had
been
deposited
about
the
time
of
the
arrival
of
the
continental
express
on
the
of
november
so
that
its
owner
must
have
gone
straight
on
to
eltham
that
is
how
the
affair
stands
at
present
and
should
the
missing
man
never
reappear
or
should
his
body
never
be
found
the
question
as
you
see
which
will
be
required
to
be
settled
is
is
the
exact
time
and
place
when
and
where
he
was
last
known
to
be
alive
as
to
the
place
the
importance
of
the
issues
involved
in
that
question
is
obvious
and
we
need
not
consider
it
but
the
question
of
time
has
another
kind
of
significance
cases
have
occurred
as
i
pointed
out
in
the
lecture
in
which
proof
of
survivorship
by
less
than
a
minute
has
secured
succession
to
property
now
the
missing
man
was
last
seen
alive
at
hurst
house
at
twenty
minutes
past
five
on
the
of
november
but
he
appears
to
have
visited
his
house
at
woodford
and
since
nobody
saw
him
at
that
house
it
is
at
present
uncertain
whether
he
went
there
before
calling
on
hurst
if
he
went
there
first
then
twenty
minutes
past
five
on
the
evening
of
the
is
the
latest
moment
at
which
he
is
known
to
have
been
alive
but
if
he
went
there
after
there
would
have
to
be
added
to
this
time
the
shortest
time
possible
in
which
he
could
travel
from
the
one
house
to
the
other
but
the
question
as
to
which
house
he
visited
first
hinges
on
the
scarab
if
he
was
wearing
the
scarab
when
he
arrived
at
house
it
would
be
certain
that
he
went
there
first
but
if
it
was
not
then
on
his
a
probability
would
be
established
that
he
went
first
to
woodford
thus
you
see
a
question
which
may
conceivably
become
of
the
most
vital
moment
in
determining
the
succession
of
property
turns
on
the
observation
or
by
this
housemaid
of
an
apparently
trivial
and
insignificant
fact
has
the
servant
made
any
statement
on
this
subject
sir
i
ventured
to
inquire
apparently
not
replied
thorndyke
at
any
rate
there
is
no
reference
to
any
such
statement
in
the
newspaper
report
though
otherwise
the
case
is
reported
in
great
detail
indeed
the
wealth
of
detail
including
plans
of
the
two
houses
is
quite
remarkable
and
well
worth
noting
as
being
in
itself
a
fact
of
considerable
interest
in
what
respect
sir
is
it
of
interest
one
of
the
students
asked
ah
replied
thorndyke
i
think
i
must
leave
you
to
consider
that
question
yourself
this
is
an
untried
case
and
we
must
make
free
with
the
actions
and
motives
of
individuals
does
the
paper
give
any
description
of
the
missing
man
sir
i
asked
yes
quite
an
exhaustive
description
indeed
it
is
exhaustive
to
the
verge
of
impropriety
considering
that
the
man
may
turn
up
alive
and
well
at
any
moment
it
seems
that
he
has
an
old
pott
fracture
of
the
left
ankle
a
linear
longitudinal
scar
on
each
knee
origin
not
stated
but
easily
guessed
at
and
that
he
has
tattooed
on
his
chest
in
vermilion
a
very
finely
and
distinctly
executed
representation
of
the
symbolical
eye
of
osiris
or
horus
or
ra
as
the
different
authorities
have
it
there
certainly
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
in
identifying
the
body
but
we
hope
that
it
will
not
come
to
that
and
now
i
must
really
be
running
away
and
so
must
you
but
i
would
advise
you
all
to
get
copies
of
the
paper
and
file
them
when
you
have
read
the
remarkably
full
details
it
is
a
most
curious
case
and
it
is
highly
probable
that
we
shall
hear
of
it
again
good
afternoon
gentlemen
thorndyke
advice
appealed
to
all
who
heard
it
for
medical
jurisprudence
was
a
live
subject
at
margaret
and
all
of
us
were
keenly
interested
in
it
as
a
result
we
sallied
forth
in
a
body
to
the
nearest
and
having
each
provided
himself
with
a
copy
of
the
adjourned
together
to
the
common
room
to
devour
the
report
and
thereafter
to
discuss
the
bearings
of
the
case
unhampered
by
those
considerations
of
delicacy
that
afflicted
our
more
squeamish
and
scrupulous
teacher
chapter
ii
the
eavesdropper
it
is
one
of
the
canons
of
correct
conduct
scrupulously
adhered
to
when
convenient
by
all
persons
that
an
acquaintance
should
be
initiated
by
a
proper
introduction
to
this
salutary
rule
which
i
have
disregarded
to
the
extent
of
an
entire
chapter
i
now
hasten
to
conform
and
the
more
so
inasmuch
as
nearly
two
years
have
passed
since
my
first
informal
appearance
permit
me
then
to
introduce
paul
berkeley
recently
very
recently
qualified
faultlessly
attired
in
the
professional
and
tall
hat
and
at
the
moment
of
introduction
navigating
with
anxious
care
a
perilous
strait
between
a
row
of
and
a
colossal
tray
piled
high
with
kidney
potatoes
the
passage
of
this
strait
landed
me
on
the
terra
firma
of
court
where
i
halted
for
a
moment
to
consult
my
visiting
list
there
was
only
one
more
patient
for
me
to
see
this
morning
and
he
lived
at
nevill
court
wherever
that
might
be
i
turned
for
information
to
the
presiding
deity
of
the
coal
shop
can
you
direct
me
jablett
to
nevill
court
she
could
and
she
did
grasping
me
confidentially
by
the
arm
the
mark
remained
on
my
sleeve
for
weeks
and
pointing
a
shaking
forefinger
at
the
dead
wall
ahead
nevill
court
said
jablett
is
a
alley
and
you
goes
into
it
through
a
archway
it
turns
out
on
fetter
lane
on
the
right
as
you
goes
up
oppersight
bream
buildings
i
thanked
jablett
and
went
on
my
way
glad
that
the
morning
round
was
nearly
finished
and
vaguely
conscious
of
a
growing
appetite
and
of
a
desire
to
wash
in
hot
water
the
practice
which
i
was
conducting
was
not
my
own
it
belonged
to
poor
dick
barnard
an
old
margaret
man
of
irrepressible
spirits
and
indifferent
physique
who
had
started
only
the
day
before
for
a
trip
down
the
mediterranean
on
board
a
tramp
engaged
in
the
currant
trade
and
this
my
second
morning
round
was
in
some
sort
a
voyage
of
geographical
discovery
i
walked
on
briskly
up
fetter
lane
until
a
narrow
arched
opening
bearing
the
superscription
nevill
court
arrested
my
steps
and
here
i
turned
to
encounter
one
of
those
surprises
that
lie
in
wait
for
the
traveler
in
london
expecting
to
find
the
gray
squalor
of
the
ordinary
london
court
i
looked
out
from
under
the
shadow
of
the
arch
past
a
row
of
decent
little
shops
through
a
vista
full
of
light
and
color
a
vista
of
ancient
roofs
and
walls
relieved
by
sunlit
foliage
in
the
heart
of
london
a
tree
is
always
a
delightful
surprise
but
here
were
not
only
trees
but
bushes
and
even
flowers
the
narrow
footway
was
bordered
by
little
gardens
which
with
their
wooden
palings
and
shrubs
gave
to
the
place
an
air
of
quaint
and
sober
rusticity
and
even
as
i
entered
a
bevy
of
workgirls
with
blouses
and
hair
aflame
in
the
sunlight
brightened
up
the
quiet
background
like
the
wild
flowers
that
spangle
a
summer
hedgerow
in
one
of
the
gardens
i
noticed
that
the
little
paths
were
paved
with
what
looked
like
circular
tiles
but
which
on
inspection
i
found
to
be
stone
buried
bottom
upwards
and
i
was
meditating
upon
the
quaint
conceit
of
the
forgotten
scrivener
who
had
thus
adorned
his
habitation
a
perhaps
or
an
author
or
perchance
even
a
poet
when
i
perceived
the
number
that
i
was
seeking
inscribed
on
a
shabby
door
in
a
high
wall
there
was
no
bell
or
knocker
so
lifting
the
latch
i
pushed
the
door
open
and
entered
but
if
the
court
itself
had
been
a
surprise
this
was
a
positive
wonder
a
dream
here
within
earshot
of
the
rumble
of
fleet
street
i
was
in
an
garden
enclosed
by
high
walls
and
now
that
the
gate
was
shut
cut
off
from
all
sight
and
knowledge
of
the
urban
world
that
seethed
without
i
stood
and
gazed
in
delighted
astonishment
trees
and
flower
beds
gay
with
blossom
lupins
snapdragons
nasturtiums
spiry
foxgloves
and
mighty
hollyhocks
formed
the
foreground
over
which
a
pair
of
butterflies
flitted
unmindful
of
a
buxom
and
miraculously
clean
white
cat
which
pursued
them
dancing
across
the
borders
and
clapping
her
snowy
paws
fruitlessly
in
and
the
background
was
no
less
wonderful
a
grand
old
house
and
venerable
that
must
have
looked
down
on
this
garden
when
ruffled
dandies
were
borne
in
sedan
chairs
through
the
court
and
gentle
izaak
walton
stealing
forth
from
his
shop
in
fleet
street
strolled
up
fetter
lane
to
go
at
temple
mills
so
overpowered
was
i
by
this
unexpected
vision
that
my
hand
was
on
the
bottom
knob
of
a
row
of
before
i
recollected
myself
and
it
was
not
until
a
most
infernal
jangling
from
within
recalled
me
to
my
business
that
i
observed
underneath
it
a
small
brass
plate
inscribed
miss
oman
the
door
opened
with
some
suddenness
and
a
short
woman
surveyed
me
hungrily
have
i
rung
the
wrong
bell
i
asked
foolishly
enough
i
must
admit
how
can
i
tell
she
demanded
i
expect
you
have
it
the
sort
of
thing
a
man
would
do
ring
the
wrong
bell
and
then
say
he
sorry
i
did
go
as
far
as
that
i
retorted
it
seems
to
have
had
the
desired
effect
and
i
made
your
acquaintance
into
the
bargain
whom
do
you
want
to
see
she
asked
mr
bellingham
are
you
the
doctor
i
doctor
follow
me
upstairs
said
miss
oman
and
do
tread
on
the
paint
i
crossed
the
spacious
hall
and
preceded
by
my
conductress
ascended
a
noble
oak
staircase
treading
carefully
on
a
ribbon
of
matting
that
ran
up
the
middle
on
the
landing
miss
oman
opened
a
door
and
pointing
to
the
room
said
go
in
there
and
wait
i
tell
her
here
i
said
bellingham
i
began
but
the
door
slammed
on
me
and
miss
oman
footsteps
retreated
rapidly
down
the
stairs
it
was
at
once
obvious
to
me
that
i
was
in
a
very
awkward
position
the
room
into
which
i
had
been
shown
communicated
with
another
and
though
the
door
of
communication
was
shut
i
was
unpleasantly
aware
of
a
conversation
that
was
taking
place
in
the
adjoining
room
at
first
indeed
only
a
vague
mutter
with
a
few
disjointed
phrases
came
through
the
door
but
suddenly
an
angry
voice
rang
out
clear
and
painfully
distinct
yes
i
did
and
i
say
it
again
bribery
collusion
that
what
it
amounts
to
you
want
to
square
me
nothing
of
the
kind
godfrey
was
the
reply
in
a
lower
tone
but
at
this
point
i
coughed
emphatically
and
moved
a
chair
and
the
voices
subsided
once
more
into
an
indistinct
murmur
to
distract
my
attention
from
my
unseen
neighbors
i
glanced
curiously
about
the
room
and
speculated
upon
the
personalities
of
its
occupants
a
very
curious
room
it
was
with
its
pathetic
suggestion
of
decayed
splendor
and
dignity
a
room
full
of
interest
and
character
and
of
contrasts
and
perplexing
contradictions
for
the
most
part
it
spoke
of
unmistakable
though
decent
poverty
it
was
nearly
bare
of
furniture
and
what
little
there
was
was
of
the
cheapest
a
small
kitchen
table
and
three
windsor
chairs
two
of
them
with
arms
a
threadbare
string
carpet
on
the
floor
and
a
cheap
cotton
cloth
on
the
table
these
with
a
set
of
bookshelves
frankly
constructed
of
grocer
boxes
formed
the
entire
suite
and
yet
despite
its
poverty
the
place
exhaled
an
air
of
homely
if
rather
ascetic
comfort
and
the
taste
was
irreproachable
the
quiet
russet
of
the
struck
a
pleasant
harmony
with
the
subdued
bluish
green
of
the
worn
carpet
the
windsor
chairs
and
the
legs
of
the
table
had
been
carefully
denuded
of
their
glaring
varnish
and
stained
a
sober
brown
and
the
austerity
of
the
whole
was
relieved
by
a
ginger
jar
filled
with
flowers
and
set
in
the
middle
of
the
table
but
the
contrasts
of
which
i
have
spoken
were
most
singular
and
puzzling
there
were
the
bookshelves
for
instance
home
made
and
stained
at
the
cost
of
a
few
pence
but
filled
with
recent
and
costly
new
works
on
archeology
and
ancient
art
there
were
the
objects
on
the
mantelpiece
a
facsimile
in
bronze
not
bronze
plaster
of
the
beautiful
head
of
hypnos
and
a
pair
of
fine
ushabti
figures
there
were
the
decorations
of
the
walls
a
number
of
etchings
signed
proofs
every
one
of
them
of
oriental
subjects
and
a
splendid
facsimile
reproduction
of
an
egyptian
papyrus
it
was
incongruous
in
the
extreme
this
mingling
of
costly
refinements
with
the
barest
and
shabbiest
necessaries
of
life
of
fastidious
culture
with
manifest
poverty
i
could
make
nothing
of
it
what
manner
of
man
i
wondered
was
this
new
patient
of
mine
was
he
a
miser
hiding
himself
and
his
wealth
in
this
obscure
court
an
eccentric
savant
a
philosopher
or
more
probably
a
crank
but
at
this
point
my
meditations
were
interrupted
by
the
voice
from
the
adjoining
room
once
more
raised
in
anger
but
i
say
that
you
making
an
accusation
you
are
implying
that
i
made
away
with
him
not
at
all
was
the
reply
but
i
repeat
that
it
is
your
business
to
ascertain
what
has
become
of
him
the
responsibility
rests
upon
you
upon
me
rejoined
the
first
voice
and
what
about
you
your
position
is
a
pretty
fishy
one
if
it
comes
to
that
what
roared
the
other
do
you
insinuate
that
i
murdered
my
own
brother
during
this
amazing
colloquy
i
had
stood
gaping
with
sheer
astonishment
suddenly
i
recollected
myself
and
dropping
into
a
chair
set
my
elbows
on
my
knees
and
clapped
my
hands
over
my
ears
and
thus
i
must
have
remained
for
a
full
minute
when
i
became
aware
of
the
closing
of
a
door
behind
me
i
sprang
to
my
feet
and
turned
in
some
embarrassment
for
i
must
have
looked
unspeakably
ridiculous
to
confront
the
somber
figure
of
a
rather
tall
and
strikingly
handsome
girl
who
as
she
stood
with
her
hand
on
the
knob
of
the
door
saluted
me
with
a
formal
bow
in
an
instantaneous
glance
i
noted
how
perfectly
she
matched
her
strange
surroundings
with
eyes
and
a
grave
sad
face
of
ivory
pallor
she
stood
like
one
of
old
portraits
a
harmony
in
tones
so
low
as
to
be
but
one
step
removed
from
monochrome
obviously
a
lady
in
spite
of
the
worn
and
rusty
dress
and
something
in
the
poise
of
the
head
and
the
set
of
the
straight
brows
hinted
at
a
spirit
that
adversity
had
hardened
rather
than
broken
i
must
ask
you
to
forgive
me
for
keeping
you
waiting
she
said
and
as
she
spoke
a
certain
softening
at
the
corners
of
the
austere
mouth
reminded
me
of
the
absurd
position
in
which
she
had
found
me
i
murmured
that
the
trifling
delay
was
of
no
consequence
whatever
that
i
had
in
fact
been
rather
glad
of
the
rest
and
i
was
beginning
somewhat
vaguely
to
approach
the
subject
of
the
invalid
when
the
voice
from
the
adjoining
room
again
broke
forth
with
hideous
distinctness
i
tell
you
i
do
nothing
of
the
kind
why
confound
you
nothing
less
than
a
conspiracy
that
your
transcriber
note
you
proposing
miss
bellingham
as
i
assumed
her
to
be
stepped
quickly
across
the
floor
flushing
angrily
as
well
she
might
but
as
she
reached
the
door
it
flew
open
and
a
small
spruce
man
burst
into
the
room
your
father
is
mad
ruth
he
exclaimed
absolutely
stark
mad
and
i
refuse
to
hold
any
further
communication
with
him
the
present
interview
was
not
of
his
seeking
miss
bellingham
replied
coldly
no
it
was
not
was
the
wrathful
rejoinder
it
was
my
mistaken
generosity
but
there
what
is
the
use
of
talking
i
done
my
best
for
you
and
i
do
no
more
do
trouble
to
let
me
out
i
can
find
my
way
with
a
stiff
bow
and
a
quick
glance
at
me
the
speaker
strode
out
of
the
room
banging
the
door
after
him
i
must
apologize
for
this
extraordinary
reception
said
miss
bellingham
but
i
believe
medical
men
are
not
easily
astonished
i
will
introduce
you
to
your
patient
now
she
opened
the
door
and
as
i
followed
her
into
the
adjoining
room
she
said
here
is
another
visitor
for
you
dear
doctor
berkeley
said
i
i
am
acting
for
my
friend
doctor
barnard
the
invalid
a
man
of
about
who
sat
propped
up
in
bed
with
a
pile
of
pillows
held
out
an
excessively
shaky
hand
which
i
grasped
cordially
making
a
mental
note
of
the
tremor
how
do
you
do
sir
said
bellingham
i
hope
doctor
barnard
is
not
oh
no
i
answered
he
has
gone
for
a
trip
down
the
mediterranean
on
a
currant
ship
the
chance
occurred
rather
suddenly
and
i
bustled
him
off
before
he
had
time
to
change
his
mind
hence
my
rather
unceremonious
appearance
which
i
hope
you
will
forgive
not
at
all
was
the
hearty
response
i
delighted
to
hear
that
you
sent
him
off
he
wanted
a
holiday
poor
man
and
i
am
delighted
to
make
your
acquaintance
too
it
is
very
good
of
you
i
said
whereupon
he
bowed
as
gracefully
as
a
man
may
who
is
propped
up
in
bed
with
a
heap
of
pillows
and
having
thus
exchanged
broadsides
of
civility
so
to
speak
we
or
at
least
i
proceeded
to
business
how
long
have
you
been
laid
up
i
asked
cautiously
not
wishing
to
make
too
evident
the
fact
that
my
principal
had
given
me
no
information
respecting
his
case
a
week
he
replied
the
et
origo
was
a
which
upset
me
opposite
the
law
courts
sent
me
sprawling
in
the
middle
of
the
road
my
own
fault
of
course
at
least
the
cabby
said
so
and
i
suppose
he
knew
but
that
was
no
consolation
to
me
were
you
hurt
much
no
not
really
but
the
fall
bruised
my
knee
rather
badly
and
gave
me
a
deuce
of
a
shake
up
i
too
old
for
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
most
people
are
said
i
true
but
you
can
take
a
cropper
more
gracefully
at
twenty
than
at
however
the
knee
is
getting
on
quite
well
you
shall
see
it
presently
and
you
observe
that
i
am
giving
it
complete
rest
but
that
is
the
whole
of
the
trouble
or
the
worst
of
it
it
my
confounded
nerves
i
as
irritable
as
the
devil
and
as
nervous
as
a
cat
and
i
ca
get
a
decent
night
rest
i
recalled
the
tremulous
hand
that
he
had
offered
me
he
did
not
look
like
a
drinker
but
still
do
you
smoke
much
i
inquired
diplomatically
he
looked
at
me
slyly
and
chuckled
that
a
very
delicate
way
to
approach
the
subject
doctor
he
said
no
i
do
smoke
much
and
i
do
crook
my
little
finger
i
saw
you
look
at
my
shaky
hand
just
now
oh
it
all
right
i
not
offended
it
a
doctor
business
to
keep
his
eyelids
lifting
but
my
hand
is
steady
enough
as
a
rule
when
i
not
upset
but
the
least
excitement
sets
me
shaking
like
a
jelly
and
the
fact
is
that
i
have
just
had
a
deucedly
unpleasant
interview
i
think
miss
bellingham
interrupted
doctor
berkeley
and
indeed
the
neighborhood
at
large
are
aware
of
the
fact
bellingham
laughed
rather
shamefacedly
i
afraid
i
did
lose
my
temper
he
said
but
i
am
an
impulsive
old
fellow
doctor
and
when
i
put
out
i
apt
to
speak
my
mind
a
little
too
bluntly
perhaps
and
audibly
his
daughter
added
do
you
know
that
doctor
berkeley
was
reduced
to
the
necessity
of
stopping
his
ears
she
glanced
at
me
as
she
spoke
with
something
like
a
twinkle
in
her
solemn
gray
eyes
did
i
shout
bellingham
asked
not
very
contritely
i
thought
though
he
added
i
very
sorry
my
dear
but
it
wo
happen
again
i
think
we
seen
the
last
of
that
good
gentleman
i
am
sure
i
hope
so
she
rejoined
adding
and
now
i
will
leave
you
to
your
talk
i
shall
be
in
the
next
room
if
you
should
want
me
i
opened
the
door
for
her
and
when
she
had
passed
out
with
a
stiff
little
bow
i
seated
myself
by
the
bedside
and
resumed
the
consultation
it
was
evidently
a
case
of
nervous
breakdown
to
which
the
cab
accident
had
no
doubt
contributed
as
to
the
other
antecedents
they
were
of
no
concern
of
mine
though
bellingham
seemed
to
think
otherwise
for
he
resumed
that
cab
business
was
the
last
straw
you
know
and
it
finished
me
off
but
i
have
been
going
down
the
hill
for
a
long
time
i
had
a
lot
of
trouble
during
the
last
two
years
but
i
suppose
i
ought
to
pester
you
with
the
details
of
my
personal
affairs
anything
that
bears
on
your
present
state
of
health
is
of
interest
to
me
if
you
do
mind
telling
it
i
said
mind
he
exclaimed
did
you
ever
meet
an
invalid
who
did
enjoy
talking
about
his
own
health
it
the
listener
who
minds
as
a
rule
well
the
present
listener
does
i
said
then
said
bellingham
i
treat
myself
to
the
luxury
of
telling
you
all
my
troubles
i
do
often
get
the
chance
of
a
confidential
grumble
to
a
responsible
man
of
my
own
class
and
i
really
have
some
excuses
for
railing
at
fortune
as
you
will
agree
when
i
tell
you
that
a
couple
of
years
ago
i
went
to
bed
one
night
a
gentleman
of
independent
means
and
excellent
prospects
and
woke
up
in
the
morning
to
find
myself
practically
a
beggar
not
a
cheerful
experience
that
you
know
at
my
time
of
life
eh
no
i
agreed
nor
at
any
other
and
that
was
not
all
he
continued
for
at
the
same
moment
i
lost
my
brother
my
dearest
kindest
friend
he
disappeared
vanished
off
the
face
of
the
earth
but
perhaps
you
have
heard
of
the
affair
the
confounded
papers
were
full
of
it
at
the
time
he
paused
abruptly
noticing
no
doubt
a
sudden
change
in
my
face
of
course
i
recollected
the
case
now
indeed
ever
since
i
had
entered
the
house
some
chord
of
memory
had
been
faintly
vibrating
and
now
his
last
words
had
struck
out
the
full
note
yes
i
said
i
remember
the
incident
though
i
do
suppose
i
should
but
for
the
fact
that
our
lecturer
on
medical
jurisprudence
drew
my
attention
to
it
indeed
said
bellingham
rather
uneasily
as
i
fancied
what
did
he
say
about
it
he
referred
to
it
as
a
case
that
was
calculated
to
give
rise
to
some
very
pretty
legal
complications
by
jove
exclaimed
bellingham
that
man
was
a
prophet
legal
complications
indeed
but
i
be
bound
he
never
guessed
at
the
sort
of
infernal
tangle
that
has
actually
gathered
round
the
affair
by
the
way
what
was
his
name
thorndyke
i
replied
doctor
john
thorndyke
thorndyke
bellingham
repeated
in
a
musing
retrospective
tone
i
seem
to
remember
the
name
yes
of
course
i
have
heard
a
legal
friend
of
mine
a
marchmont
speak
of
him
in
reference
to
the
case
of
a
man
whom
i
knew
slightly
years
ago
a
certain
jeffrey
blackmore
who
also
disappeared
very
mysteriously
i
remember
now
that
thorndyke
unraveled
that
case
with
most
remarkable
ingenuity
i
daresay
he
would
be
very
much
interested
to
hear
about
your
case
i
suggested
i
daresay
he
would
was
the
reply
but
one
ca
take
up
a
professional
man
time
for
nothing
and
i
could
afford
to
pay
him
and
that
reminds
me
that
i
taking
up
your
time
by
gossiping
about
purely
personal
affairs
my
morning
round
is
finished
said
i
and
moreover
your
personal
affairs
are
highly
interesting
i
suppose
i
must
ask
what
is
the
nature
of
the
legal
entanglement
not
unless
you
are
prepared
to
stay
here
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
go
home
a
raving
lunatic
but
i
tell
you
this
much
the
trouble
is
about
my
poor
brother
will
in
the
first
place
it
ca
be
administered
because
there
is
not
sufficient
evidence
that
my
brother
is
dead
and
in
the
second
place
if
it
could
all
the
property
would
go
to
people
who
were
never
intended
to
benefit
the
will
itself
is
the
most
diabolically
exasperating
document
that
was
ever
produced
by
the
perverted
ingenuity
of
a
wrongheaded
man
that
all
will
you
have
a
look
at
my
knee
as
bellingham
explanation
delivered
in
a
rapid
and
ending
almost
in
a
shout
had
left
him
and
trembling
i
thought
it
best
to
bring
our
talk
to
an
end
accordingly
i
proceeded
to
inspect
the
injured
knee
which
was
now
nearly
well
and
to
overhaul
my
patient
generally
and
having
given
him
detailed
instructions
as
to
his
general
conduct
i
rose
and
took
my
leave
and
remember
i
said
as
i
shook
his
hand
no
tobacco
no
coffee
no
excitement
of
any
kind
lead
a
quiet
bovine
life
that
all
very
well
he
grumbled
but
supposing
people
come
here
and
excite
me
disregard
them
said
i
and
read
and
with
this
parting
advice
i
passed
out
into
the
other
room
miss
bellingham
was
seated
at
the
table
with
a
pile
of
notebooks
before
her
two
of
which
were
open
displaying
pages
closely
written
in
a
small
neat
handwriting
she
rose
as
i
entered
and
looked
at
me
inquiringly
i
heard
you
advising
my
father
to
read
she
said
was
that
a
curative
measure
entirely
i
replied
i
recommended
it
for
its
medicinal
virtues
as
an
antidote
to
mental
excitement
she
smiled
faintly
it
certainly
is
not
a
highly
emotional
book
she
said
and
then
asked
have
you
any
other
instructions
to
give
well
i
might
give
the
conventional
advice
to
maintain
a
cheerful
outlook
and
avoid
worry
but
i
do
suppose
you
would
find
it
very
helpful
no
she
answered
bitterly
it
is
a
counsel
of
perfection
people
in
our
position
are
not
a
very
cheerful
class
i
afraid
but
still
they
do
seek
out
worries
from
sheer
perverseness
the
worries
come
unsought
but
of
course
you
ca
enter
into
that
i
ca
give
any
practical
help
i
fear
though
i
do
sincerely
hope
that
you
father
affairs
will
straighten
themselves
out
soon
she
thanked
me
for
my
good
wishes
and
accompanied
me
down
to
the
street
door
where
with
a
bow
and
a
rather
stiff
handshake
she
gave
me
my
very
ungratefully
the
noise
of
fetter
lane
smote
on
my
ears
as
i
came
out
through
the
archway
and
very
squalid
and
unrestful
the
little
street
looked
when
contrasted
with
the
dignity
and
monastic
quiet
of
the
old
garden
as
to
the
surgery
with
its
oilcloth
floor
and
walls
made
hideous
with
gaudy
insurance
in
sham
gilt
frames
its
aspect
was
so
revolting
that
i
flew
to
the
for
distraction
and
was
still
busily
entering
the
morning
visits
when
the
adolphus
entered
stealthily
to
announce
lunch
chapter
iii
john
thorndyke
that
the
character
of
an
individual
tends
to
be
reflected
in
his
dress
is
a
fact
familiar
to
the
least
observant
that
the
observation
is
equally
applicable
to
aggregates
of
men
is
less
familiar
but
equally
true
do
not
the
members
of
fighting
professions
even
to
this
day
deck
themselves
in
feathers
in
gaudy
colors
and
gilded
ornaments
after
the
manner
of
the
african
or
the
redskin
brave
and
thereby
indicate
the
place
of
war
in
modern
civilization
does
not
the
church
of
rome
send
her
priests
to
the
altar
in
habiliments
that
were
fashionable
before
the
fall
of
the
roman
empire
in
token
of
her
immovable
conservatism
and
lastly
does
not
the
law
lumbering
on
in
the
wake
of
progress
symbolize
its
subjection
to
precedent
by
reminiscent
of
the
good
days
of
queen
anne
i
should
apologize
for
intruding
upon
the
reader
these
somewhat
trite
reflections
which
were
set
going
by
the
quaint
of
the
shop
in
the
cloisters
of
the
inner
temple
whither
i
strayed
on
a
sultry
afternoon
in
quest
of
shade
and
quiet
i
had
halted
opposite
the
little
shop
window
and
with
my
eyes
bent
dreamily
on
the
row
of
wigs
was
pursuing
the
above
train
of
thought
when
i
was
startled
by
a
deep
voice
saying
softly
in
my
ear
i
have
the
one
if
i
were
you
i
turned
swiftly
and
rather
fiercely
and
looked
into
the
face
of
my
old
friend
and
fellow
student
jervis
behind
whom
regarding
us
with
a
sedate
smile
stood
my
former
teacher
john
thorndyke
both
men
greeted
me
with
a
warmth
that
i
felt
to
be
very
flattering
for
thorndyke
was
quite
a
great
personage
and
even
jervis
was
several
years
my
academic
senior
you
are
coming
in
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
us
i
hope
said
thorndyke
and
as
i
assented
gladly
he
took
my
arm
and
led
me
across
the
court
in
the
direction
of
the
treasury
but
why
that
hungry
gaze
at
those
forensic
vanities
berkeley
he
asked
are
you
thinking
of
following
my
example
and
jervis
deserting
the
bedside
for
the
bar
what
has
jervis
gone
in
for
the
law
i
exclaimed
bless
you
yes
replied
jervis
i
have
become
parasitical
on
thorndyke
big
fleas
have
little
fleas
you
know
i
am
the
additional
fraction
trailing
after
the
whole
number
in
the
rear
of
a
decimal
point
do
you
believe
him
berkeley
interposed
thorndyke
he
is
the
brains
of
the
firm
i
supply
the
respectability
and
moral
worth
but
you
have
answered
my
question
what
are
you
doing
here
on
a
summer
afternoon
staring
into
a
window
i
am
barnard
locum
he
is
in
practise
in
fetter
lane
i
know
said
thorndyke
we
meet
him
occasionally
and
very
pale
and
peaky
he
has
been
looking
of
late
is
he
taking
a
holiday
yes
he
has
gone
for
a
trip
to
the
isles
of
greece
in
a
currant
ship
then
said
jervis
you
are
actually
a
local
i
thought
you
were
looking
beastly
respectable
and
judging
from
your
leisured
manner
when
we
encountered
you
added
thorndyke
the
practise
is
not
a
strenuous
one
i
suppose
it
is
entirely
local
yes
i
replied
the
patients
mostly
live
in
the
small
streets
and
courts
within
a
radius
of
the
surgery
and
the
abodes
of
some
of
them
are
pretty
squalid
oh
and
that
reminds
me
of
a
very
strange
coincidence
it
will
interest
you
i
think
life
is
made
up
of
strange
coincidences
said
thorndyke
nobody
but
a
reviewer
of
novels
is
ever
really
surprised
at
a
coincidence
but
what
is
yours
it
is
connected
with
a
case
that
you
mentioned
to
us
at
the
hospital
about
two
years
ago
the
case
of
a
man
who
disappeared
under
rather
mysterious
circumstances
do
you
remember
it
the
man
name
was
bellingham
the
egyptologist
yes
i
remember
the
case
quite
well
what
about
it
the
brother
is
a
patient
of
mine
he
is
living
in
nevill
court
with
his
daughter
and
they
seem
to
be
as
poor
as
church
mice
really
said
thorndyke
this
is
quite
interesting
they
must
have
come
down
in
the
world
rather
suddenly
if
i
remember
rightly
the
brother
was
living
in
a
house
of
some
pretentions
standing
in
its
own
grounds
yes
that
is
so
i
see
you
recollect
all
about
the
case
my
dear
fellow
said
jervis
thorndyke
never
forgets
a
likely
case
he
is
a
sort
of
camel
he
gulps
down
the
raw
facts
from
the
newspapers
or
elsewhere
and
then
in
his
leisure
moments
he
calmly
regurgitates
them
and
has
a
quiet
chew
at
them
it
is
a
quaint
habit
a
case
crops
up
in
the
papers
or
in
one
of
the
courts
and
thorndyke
swallows
it
whole
then
it
lapses
and
every
one
forgets
it
a
year
or
two
later
it
crops
up
in
a
new
form
and
to
your
astonishment
you
find
that
thorndyke
has
got
it
all
cut
and
dried
he
has
been
ruminating
on
it
periodically
in
the
interval
you
notice
said
thorndyke
that
my
learned
friend
is
pleased
to
indulge
in
mixed
metaphors
but
his
statement
is
substantially
true
though
obscurely
worded
you
must
tell
us
more
about
the
bellinghams
when
we
have
fortified
you
with
a
cup
of
tea
our
talk
had
brought
us
to
thorndyke
chambers
which
were
on
the
first
floor
of
no
king
bench
walk
and
as
we
entered
the
fine
spacious
paneled
room
we
found
a
small
elderly
man
neatly
dressed
in
black
setting
out
the
on
the
table
i
glanced
at
him
with
some
curiosity
he
hardly
looked
like
a
servant
in
spite
of
his
neat
black
clothes
in
fact
his
appearance
was
rather
puzzling
for
while
his
quiet
dignity
and
his
serious
intelligent
face
suggested
some
kind
of
professional
man
his
neat
capable
hands
were
those
of
a
skilled
mechanic
thorndyke
surveyed
the
thoughtfully
and
then
looked
at
his
retainer
i
see
you
have
put
three
teacups
polton
he
said
now
how
did
you
know
i
was
bringing
some
one
in
to
tea
the
little
man
smiled
a
quaint
crinkly
smile
of
gratification
as
he
explained
i
happened
to
look
out
of
the
laboratory
window
as
you
turned
the
corner
sir
how
disappointingly
simple
said
jervis
we
were
hoping
for
something
abstruse
and
telepathic
simplicity
is
the
soul
of
efficiency
sir
replied
polton
as
he
checked
the
to
make
sure
that
nothing
was
forgotten
and
with
this
remarkable
aphorism
he
silently
evaporated
to
return
to
the
bellingham
case
said
thorndyke
when
he
had
poured
out
the
tea
have
you
picked
up
any
facts
relating
to
the
parties
and
facts
i
mean
of
course
that
it
would
be
proper
for
you
to
mention
i
have
learned
one
or
two
things
that
there
is
no
harm
in
repeating
for
instance
i
gather
that
godfrey
bellingham
my
patient
lost
all
his
property
quite
suddenly
about
the
time
of
the
disappearance
that
is
really
odd
said
thorndyke
the
opposite
condition
would
be
quite
understandable
but
one
does
see
exactly
how
this
can
have
happened
unless
there
was
an
allowance
of
some
sort
no
that
was
what
struck
me
but
there
seem
to
be
some
queer
features
in
the
case
and
the
legal
position
is
evidently
getting
complicated
there
is
a
will
for
example
which
is
giving
trouble
they
will
hardly
be
able
to
administer
the
will
without
either
proof
or
presumption
of
death
thorndyke
remarked
exactly
that
one
of
the
difficulties
another
is
that
there
seems
to
be
some
fatal
defect
in
the
drafting
of
the
will
itself
i
do
know
what
it
is
but
i
expect
i
shall
hear
sooner
or
later
by
the
way
i
mentioned
the
interest
that
you
have
taken
in
the
case
and
i
think
bellingham
would
have
liked
to
consult
you
but
of
course
the
poor
devil
has
no
money
that
is
awkward
for
him
if
the
other
interested
parties
have
there
will
probably
be
legal
proceedings
of
some
kind
and
as
the
law
takes
no
account
of
poverty
he
is
likely
to
go
to
the
wall
he
ought
to
have
advice
of
some
sort
i
do
see
how
he
is
to
get
it
said
i
neither
do
i
thorndyke
admitted
there
are
no
hospitals
for
impecunious
litigants
it
is
assumed
that
only
persons
of
means
have
a
right
to
go
to
law
of
course
if
we
knew
the
man
and
the
circumstances
we
might
be
able
to
help
him
but
for
all
we
know
to
the
contrary
he
may
be
an
arrant
scoundrel
i
had
recalled
the
strange
conversation
that
i
had
overheard
and
wondered
what
thorndyke
would
have
thought
of
it
if
it
had
been
allowable
for
me
to
repeat
it
obviously
it
was
not
however
and
i
could
only
give
my
own
impressions
he
does
strike
me
as
that
i
said
but
of
course
one
never
knows
personally
he
impressed
me
rather
favorably
which
is
more
than
the
other
man
did
what
other
man
asked
thorndyke
there
was
another
man
in
the
case
was
there
i
forget
his
name
i
saw
him
at
the
house
and
did
much
like
the
look
of
him
i
suspect
he
putting
some
sort
of
pressure
on
bellingham
berkeley
knows
more
about
this
than
he
telling
us
said
jervis
let
us
look
up
the
report
and
see
who
this
stranger
is
he
took
down
from
a
shelf
a
large
volume
of
newspaper
cuttings
and
laid
it
on
the
table
you
see
said
he
as
he
ran
his
finger
down
the
index
thorndyke
files
all
the
cases
that
are
likely
to
come
to
something
and
i
know
he
had
expectations
regarding
this
one
i
fancy
he
had
some
ghoulish
hope
that
the
missing
gentleman
head
might
turn
up
in
somebody
here
we
are
the
other
man
name
is
hurst
he
is
apparently
a
cousin
and
it
was
at
his
house
the
missing
man
was
last
seen
alive
so
you
think
hurst
is
moving
in
the
matter
said
thorndyke
when
he
had
glanced
over
the
report
that
is
my
impression
i
replied
though
i
really
know
nothing
about
it
well
said
thorndyke
if
you
should
learn
what
is
being
done
and
should
have
permission
to
speak
of
it
i
shall
be
very
interested
to
hear
how
the
case
progresses
and
if
an
unofficial
opinion
on
any
point
would
be
of
service
i
think
there
would
be
no
harm
in
giving
it
it
would
certainly
be
of
great
value
if
the
other
parties
are
taking
professional
advice
i
said
and
then
after
a
pause
i
asked
have
you
given
this
case
much
consideration
thorndyke
reflected
no
he
said
i
ca
say
that
i
have
i
turned
it
over
rather
carefully
when
the
report
first
appeared
and
i
have
speculated
on
it
occasionally
since
it
is
my
habit
as
jervis
was
telling
you
to
utilize
odd
moments
of
leisure
such
as
a
railway
journey
for
instance
by
constructing
theories
to
account
for
the
facts
of
such
obscure
cases
as
have
come
to
my
notice
it
is
a
useful
habit
i
think
for
apart
from
the
mental
exercise
and
experience
that
one
gains
from
it
an
appreciable
portion
of
these
cases
ultimately
comes
into
my
hands
and
then
the
previous
consideration
of
them
is
so
much
time
gained
have
you
formed
any
theory
to
account
for
the
facts
in
this
case
i
asked
yes
i
have
several
theories
one
of
which
i
especially
favor
and
i
am
awaiting
with
great
interest
such
new
facts
as
may
indicate
to
me
which
of
these
theories
is
probably
the
correct
one
it
no
use
your
trying
to
pump
him
berkeley
said
jervis
he
is
fitted
with
an
information
valve
that
opens
inward
you
can
pour
in
as
much
as
you
like
but
you
ca
get
any
out
thorndyke
chuckled
my
learned
friend
is
in
the
main
correct
he
said
you
see
i
may
be
called
upon
any
day
to
advise
on
this
case
in
which
event
i
should
feel
remarkably
foolish
if
i
had
already
expounded
my
views
in
detail
but
i
should
like
to
hear
what
you
and
jervis
make
of
the
case
as
reported
in
the
newspapers
there
now
exclaimed
jervis
what
did
i
tell
you
he
wants
to
suck
our
brains
as
far
as
my
brain
is
concerned
i
said
the
process
of
suction
likely
to
yield
much
except
a
vacuum
so
i
will
resign
in
favor
of
you
you
are
a
lawyer
whereas
i
am
only
a
simple
jervis
filled
his
pipe
with
deliberate
care
and
lighted
it
then
blowing
a
slender
stream
of
smoke
into
the
air
he
said
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
make
of
the
case
from
that
report
i
can
tell
you
in
one
word
nothing
every
road
seems
to
end
in
a
oh
come
said
thorndyke
this
is
mere
laziness
berkeley
wants
to
witness
a
display
of
your
forensic
wisdom
a
learned
counsel
may
be
in
a
fog
he
very
often
is
but
he
does
state
the
fact
baldly
he
wraps
it
up
in
a
decent
verbal
disguise
tell
us
how
you
arrive
at
your
conclusion
show
us
that
you
have
really
weighed
the
facts
very
well
said
jervis
i
will
give
you
a
masterly
analysis
of
the
case
leading
to
nothing
he
continued
to
puff
at
his
pipe
for
a
time
with
slight
embarrassment
as
i
thought
and
i
fully
sympathized
with
him
finally
he
blew
a
little
cloud
and
commenced
the
position
appears
to
be
this
here
is
a
man
seen
to
enter
a
certain
house
who
is
shown
into
a
certain
room
and
shut
in
he
is
not
seen
to
come
out
and
yet
when
the
room
is
next
entered
it
is
found
to
be
empty
and
that
man
is
never
seen
again
alive
or
dead
that
is
a
pretty
tough
beginning
now
it
is
evident
that
one
of
three
things
must
have
happened
either
he
must
have
remained
in
that
room
or
at
least
in
that
house
alive
or
he
must
have
died
naturally
or
otherwise
and
his
body
have
been
concealed
or
he
must
have
left
the
house
unobserved
let
us
take
the
first
case
this
affair
happened
nearly
two
years
ago
now
he
have
remained
alive
in
the
house
for
two
years
he
would
have
been
noticed
the
servants
for
instance
when
cleaning
out
the
rooms
would
have
observed
him
here
thorndyke
interposed
with
an
indulgent
smile
at
his
junior
my
learned
friend
is
treating
the
inquiry
with
unbecoming
levity
we
accept
the
conclusion
that
the
man
did
not
remain
in
the
house
alive
very
well
then
did
he
remain
in
it
dead
apparently
not
the
report
says
that
as
soon
as
the
man
was
missed
hurst
and
the
servants
together
searched
the
house
thoroughly
but
there
had
been
no
time
or
opportunity
to
dispose
of
the
body
whence
the
only
possible
conclusion
is
that
the
body
was
not
there
moreover
if
we
admit
the
possibility
of
his
having
been
murdered
for
that
is
what
concealment
of
the
body
would
imply
there
is
the
question
could
have
murdered
him
not
the
servants
obviously
and
as
to
hurst
well
of
course
we
do
know
what
his
relations
with
the
missing
man
may
have
been
at
least
i
do
neither
do
i
said
thorndyke
i
know
nothing
beyond
what
is
in
the
newspaper
report
and
what
berkeley
has
told
us
then
we
know
nothing
he
may
have
had
a
motive
for
murdering
the
man
or
he
may
not
the
point
is
that
he
does
seem
to
have
had
the
opportunity
even
if
we
suppose
that
he
managed
to
conceal
the
body
temporarily
still
there
was
the
final
disposal
of
it
he
could
have
buried
it
in
the
garden
with
the
servants
about
neither
could
he
have
burned
it
the
only
conceivable
method
by
which
he
could
have
got
rid
of
it
would
have
been
that
of
cutting
it
up
into
fragments
and
burying
the
dismembered
parts
in
some
secluded
spots
or
dropping
them
into
ponds
or
rivers
but
no
remains
of
the
kind
have
been
found
as
some
of
them
probably
would
have
been
by
now
so
that
there
is
nothing
to
support
this
suggestion
indeed
the
idea
of
murder
in
this
house
at
least
seems
to
be
excluded
by
the
search
that
was
made
the
instant
the
man
was
missed
then
to
take
the
third
alternative
did
he
leave
the
house
unobserved
well
it
is
not
impossible
but
it
would
be
a
queer
thing
to
do
he
may
have
been
an
impulsive
or
eccentric
man
we
ca
say
we
know
nothing
about
him
but
two
years
have
elapsed
and
he
has
never
turned
up
so
that
if
he
left
the
house
secretly
he
must
have
gone
into
hiding
and
be
hiding
still
of
course
he
may
have
been
the
sort
of
lunatic
who
would
behave
in
that
manner
or
he
may
not
we
have
no
information
as
to
his
personal
character
then
there
is
the
complication
of
the
scarab
that
was
picked
up
in
the
grounds
of
his
brother
house
at
woodford
that
seems
to
show
that
he
visited
that
house
at
some
time
but
no
one
admits
having
seen
him
there
and
it
is
uncertain
therefore
whether
he
went
first
to
his
brother
house
or
to
hurst
if
he
was
wearing
the
scarab
when
he
arrived
at
the
eltham
house
he
must
have
left
that
house
unobserved
and
gone
to
woodford
but
if
he
was
not
wearing
it
he
probably
went
from
woodford
to
eltham
and
there
finally
disappeared
as
to
whether
he
was
or
was
not
wearing
the
scarab
when
he
was
last
seen
alive
by
housemaid
there
is
at
present
no
evidence
if
he
went
to
his
brother
house
after
his
visit
to
hurst
the
disappearance
is
more
understandable
if
we
do
mind
flinging
accusations
of
murder
about
rather
casually
for
the
disposal
of
the
body
would
be
much
less
difficult
in
that
case
apparently
no
one
saw
him
enter
the
house
and
if
he
did
enter
it
was
by
a
back
gate
which
communicated
with
the
library
a
separate
building
some
distance
from
the
house
in
that
case
it
would
have
been
physically
possible
for
the
bellinghams
to
have
made
away
with
him
there
was
plenty
of
time
to
dispose
of
the
body
unobserved
temporarily
at
any
rate
nobody
had
seen
him
come
to
the
house
and
nobody
knew
that
he
was
there
if
he
was
there
and
apparently
no
search
was
made
either
at
the
time
or
afterward
in
fact
if
it
could
be
shown
that
the
missing
man
left
hurst
house
alive
or
that
he
was
wearing
the
scarab
when
he
arrived
there
things
would
look
rather
fishy
for
the
bellinghams
for
of
course
the
girl
must
have
been
in
it
if
the
father
was
but
there
the
crux
there
is
no
proof
that
the
man
ever
did
leave
hurst
house
alive
and
if
he
did
but
there
as
i
said
at
first
whichever
turning
you
take
you
find
that
it
ends
in
a
blind
alley
a
lame
ending
to
a
masterly
exposition
was
thorndyke
comment
i
know
said
jervis
but
what
would
you
have
there
are
quite
a
number
of
possible
solutions
and
one
of
them
must
be
the
true
one
but
how
are
we
to
judge
which
it
is
i
maintain
that
until
we
know
something
of
the
parties
and
the
financial
and
other
interests
involved
we
have
no
data
there
said
thorndyke
i
disagree
with
you
entirely
i
maintain
that
we
have
ample
data
you
say
that
we
have
no
means
of
judging
which
of
the
various
possible
solutions
is
the
true
one
but
i
think
that
if
you
read
the
report
carefully
and
thoughtfully
you
will
find
that
the
facts
now
known
point
to
one
explanation
and
one
only
it
may
not
be
the
true
explanation
and
i
do
suppose
it
is
but
we
are
now
dealing
with
the
matter
speculatively
academically
and
i
contend
that
our
data
yield
a
definite
conclusion
what
do
you
say
berkeley
i
say
that
it
is
time
for
me
to
be
off
the
evening
consultations
begin
at
six
well
said
thorndyke
do
let
us
keep
you
from
your
duties
with
poor
barnard
currant
picking
in
the
grecian
isles
but
come
in
and
see
us
again
drop
in
when
you
like
after
your
work
is
done
you
wo
be
in
our
way
even
if
we
are
busy
which
we
very
seldom
are
after
eight
i
thanked
thorndyke
most
heartily
for
making
me
free
of
his
chambers
in
this
hospitable
fashion
and
took
my
leave
setting
forth
homeward
by
way
of
middle
temple
lane
and
the
embankment
not
a
very
direct
route
for
fetter
lane
it
must
be
confessed
but
our
talk
had
revived
my
interest
in
the
bellingham
household
and
put
me
in
a
reflective
vein
from
the
remarkable
conversation
that
i
had
overheard
it
was
evident
that
the
plot
was
thickening
not
that
i
supposed
that
these
two
respectable
gentlemen
really
suspected
one
another
of
having
made
away
with
the
missing
man
but
still
their
unguarded
words
spoken
in
anger
made
it
clear
that
each
had
allowed
the
thought
of
sinister
possibilities
to
enter
his
mind
a
dangerous
condition
that
might
easily
grow
into
actual
suspicion
and
then
the
circumstances
really
were
highly
mysterious
as
i
realized
with
especial
vividness
now
after
listening
to
my
analysis
of
the
evidence
from
the
problem
itself
my
mind
traveled
not
for
the
first
time
during
the
last
few
days
to
the
handsome
girl
who
had
seemed
in
my
eyes
the
of
this
temple
of
mystery
in
the
quaint
little
court
what
a
strange
figure
she
had
made
against
this
strange
background
with
her
quiet
chilly
manner
her
pale
face
so
sad
and
worn
her
black
straight
brows
and
solemn
gray
eyes
so
inscrutable
mysterious
sibylline
a
striking
even
impressive
personality
this
i
reflected
with
something
in
it
somber
and
enigmatic
that
attracted
and
yet
repelled
and
here
i
recalled
jervis
words
the
girl
must
have
been
in
it
if
the
father
was
it
was
a
dreadful
thought
even
though
only
speculatively
uttered
and
my
heart
rejected
it
rejected
it
with
indignation
that
rather
surprised
me
and
this
notwithstanding
that
the
somber
figure
that
my
memory
conjured
up
was
one
that
associated
itself
with
the
idea
of
mystery
and
tragedy
chapter
iv
legal
complications
and
a
jackal
my
meditations
brought
me
by
a
circuitous
route
and
ten
minutes
late
to
the
end
of
fetter
lane
where
exchanging
my
rather
abstracted
air
for
the
alert
manner
of
a
busy
practitioner
i
strode
briskly
forward
and
darted
into
the
surgery
with
knitted
brows
as
though
just
released
from
an
anxious
case
but
there
was
only
one
patient
waiting
and
she
saluted
me
as
i
entered
with
a
snort
of
defiance
here
you
are
then
said
she
you
are
perfectly
correct
miss
oman
i
replied
in
fact
you
have
put
the
case
in
a
nutshell
what
can
i
have
the
pleasure
of
doing
for
you
nothing
was
the
answer
my
medical
adviser
is
a
lady
but
brought
a
note
from
bellingham
here
it
is
and
she
thrust
the
envelope
into
my
hand
i
glanced
through
the
note
and
learned
that
my
patient
had
had
a
couple
of
bad
nights
and
a
very
harassing
day
could
i
have
something
to
give
me
a
night
rest
it
concluded
i
reflected
for
a
few
moments
one
is
not
very
ready
to
prescribe
sleeping
draughts
for
unknown
patients
but
still
insomnia
is
a
very
distressing
condition
in
the
end
i
temporized
with
a
moderate
dose
of
bromide
deciding
to
call
and
see
if
more
energetic
measures
were
necessary
he
had
better
take
a
dose
of
this
at
once
miss
oman
said
i
as
i
handed
her
the
bottle
and
i
will
look
in
later
and
see
how
he
is
i
expect
he
will
be
glad
to
see
you
she
answered
for
he
is
all
alone
and
very
dumpy
miss
bellingham
is
out
but
i
must
remind
you
that
he
a
poor
man
and
pays
his
way
you
must
excuse
my
mentioning
it
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
hint
miss
oman
i
rejoined
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
see
him
but
i
should
like
just
to
look
in
and
have
a
chat
yes
it
will
do
him
good
you
have
your
points
though
punctuality
does
seem
to
be
one
of
them
and
with
this
parting
shot
miss
oman
bustled
away
eight
found
me
ascending
the
great
dim
staircase
of
the
house
in
nevill
court
preceded
by
miss
oman
by
whom
i
was
ushered
into
the
room
bellingham
who
had
just
finished
some
sort
of
meal
was
sitting
hunched
up
in
his
chair
gazing
gloomily
into
the
empty
grate
he
brightened
up
as
i
entered
but
was
evidently
in
very
low
spirits
i
did
mean
to
drag
you
out
after
your
day
work
was
finished
he
said
though
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
you
have
dragged
me
out
i
heard
you
were
alone
so
i
just
dropped
in
for
a
few
minutes
gossip
that
is
really
kind
of
you
he
said
heartily
but
i
afraid
find
me
rather
poor
company
a
man
who
is
full
of
his
own
highly
disagreeable
affairs
is
not
a
desirable
companion
you
must
let
me
disturb
you
if
you
rather
be
alone
said
i
with
a
sudden
fear
that
i
was
intruding
oh
you
wo
disturb
me
he
replied
adding
with
a
laugh
more
likely
to
be
the
other
way
about
in
fact
if
i
were
not
afraid
of
boring
you
to
death
i
would
ask
you
to
let
me
talk
my
difficulties
over
with
you
you
wo
bore
me
i
said
it
is
generally
interesting
to
share
another
man
experiences
without
their
inconveniences
proper
study
of
mankind
is
man
you
know
especially
to
a
doctor
bellingham
chuckled
grimly
you
make
me
feel
like
a
microbe
he
said
however
if
you
would
care
to
take
a
peep
at
me
through
your
microscope
i
will
crawl
on
to
the
stage
for
your
inspection
though
it
is
not
actions
that
furnish
the
materials
for
your
psychological
studies
it
is
my
poor
brother
who
is
the
ex
who
from
his
unknown
grave
as
i
fear
pulls
the
strings
of
this
infernal
he
paused
and
for
a
space
gazed
thoughtfully
into
the
grate
as
if
he
had
forgotten
my
presence
at
length
he
looked
up
and
resumed
it
is
a
curious
story
doctor
a
very
curious
story
part
of
it
you
know
the
middle
part
i
will
tell
you
it
from
the
beginning
and
then
you
will
know
as
much
as
i
do
for
as
to
the
end
that
is
known
to
no
one
it
is
written
no
doubt
in
the
book
of
destiny
but
the
page
has
yet
to
be
turned
the
mischief
began
with
my
father
death
he
was
a
country
clergyman
of
very
moderate
means
a
widower
with
two
children
my
brother
john
and
me
he
managed
to
send
us
both
to
oxford
after
which
john
went
into
the
foreign
office
and
i
was
to
have
gone
into
the
church
but
i
suddenly
discovered
that
my
views
on
religion
had
undergone
a
change
that
made
this
impossible
and
just
about
this
time
my
father
came
into
a
quite
considerable
property
now
as
it
was
his
expressed
intention
to
leave
the
estate
equally
divided
between
my
brother
and
me
there
was
no
need
for
me
to
take
up
any
profession
for
a
livelihood
archeology
was
already
the
passion
of
my
life
and
i
determined
to
devote
myself
henceforth
to
my
favorite
study
in
which
by
the
way
i
was
following
a
family
tendency
for
my
father
was
an
enthusiastic
student
of
ancient
oriental
history
and
john
was
as
you
know
an
ardent
egyptologist
then
my
father
died
quite
suddenly
and
left
no
will
he
had
intended
to
have
one
drawn
up
but
had
put
it
off
until
it
was
too
late
and
since
nearly
all
the
property
was
in
the
form
of
real
estate
my
brother
inherited
practically
the
whole
of
it
however
in
deference
to
the
known
wishes
of
my
father
he
made
me
an
allowance
of
five
hundred
a
year
which
was
about
a
quarter
of
the
annual
income
i
urged
him
to
assign
me
a
lump
sum
but
he
refused
to
do
this
instead
he
instructed
his
solicitor
to
pay
me
an
allowance
in
quarterly
instalments
during
the
rest
of
his
life
and
it
was
understood
that
on
his
death
the
entire
estate
should
devolve
on
me
or
if
i
died
first
on
my
daughter
ruth
then
as
you
know
he
disappeared
suddenly
and
as
the
circumstances
suggested
that
he
was
dead
and
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
was
alive
his
solicitor
a
jellicoe
found
himself
unable
to
continue
the
payment
of
the
allowance
on
the
other
hand
as
there
was
no
positive
evidence
that
my
brother
was
dead
it
was
impossible
to
administer
the
will
you
say
the
circumstances
suggested
that
your
brother
was
dead
what
circumstances
were
they
principally
the
suddenness
and
completeness
of
the
disappearance
his
luggage
as
you
may
remember
was
found
lying
unclaimed
at
the
railway
station
and
there
was
another
circumstance
even
more
suggestive
my
brother
drew
a
pension
from
the
foreign
office
for
which
he
had
to
apply
in
person
or
if
abroad
produce
proof
that
he
was
alive
on
the
date
when
the
payment
became
due
now
he
was
exceedingly
regular
in
this
respect
in
fact
he
had
never
been
known
to
fail
either
to
appear
in
person
or
to
transmit
the
necessary
documents
to
his
agent
jellicoe
but
from
the
moment
when
he
vanished
so
mysteriously
to
the
present
day
nothing
whatever
has
been
heard
of
him
it
a
very
awkward
position
for
you
i
said
but
i
should
think
there
will
not
be
much
difficulty
in
obtaining
the
permission
of
the
court
to
presume
death
and
to
proceed
to
prove
the
will
bellingham
made
a
wry
face
i
expect
you
are
right
he
said
but
that
does
help
me
much
you
see
jellicoe
having
waited
a
reasonable
time
for
my
brother
to
reappear
took
a
very
unusual
but
i
think
in
the
special
circumstances
a
very
proper
step
he
summoned
me
and
the
other
interested
party
to
his
office
and
communicated
to
us
the
provisions
of
the
will
and
very
extraordinary
provisions
they
turned
out
to
be
i
was
thunderstruck
when
i
heard
them
and
the
exasperating
thing
is
that
i
feel
sure
my
poor
brother
imagined
that
he
had
made
everything
perfectly
safe
and
simple
they
generally
do
i
said
rather
vaguely
i
suppose
they
do
said
bellingham
but
poor
john
has
made
the
most
infernal
hash
of
his
will
and
i
am
certain
that
he
has
utterly
defeated
his
own
intentions
you
see
we
are
an
old
london
family
the
house
in
queen
square
where
my
brother
nominally
lived
but
actually
kept
his
collection
has
been
occupied
by
us
for
generations
and
most
of
the
bellinghams
are
buried
in
george
close
by
though
some
members
of
the
family
are
buried
in
other
churchyards
in
the
neighborhood
now
my
brother
who
by
the
way
was
a
bachelor
had
a
strong
feeling
for
the
family
traditions
and
he
stipulated
not
unnaturally
in
his
will
that
he
should
be
buried
in
george
among
his
ancestors
or
at
least
in
one
of
the
places
of
burial
appertaining
to
his
native
parish
but
instead
of
simply
expressing
the
wish
and
directing
his
executors
to
carry
it
out
he
made
it
a
condition
affecting
the
operation
of
the
will
affecting
it
in
what
respect
i
asked
in
a
very
vital
respect
answered
bellingham
the
bulk
of
the
property
he
bequeathed
to
me
or
if
i
predeceased
him
to
my
daughter
ruth
but
the
bequest
was
subject
to
the
condition
i
have
mentioned
that
he
should
be
buried
in
a
certain
place
and
if
that
condition
was
not
fulfilled
the
bulk
of
the
property
was
to
go
to
my
cousin
george
hurst
but
in
that
case
said
i
as
you
ca
produce
the
body
neither
of
you
can
get
the
property
i
am
not
so
sure
of
that
he
replied
if
my
brother
is
dead
it
is
pretty
certain
that
he
is
not
buried
in
george
or
any
of
the
other
places
mentioned
and
the
fact
can
easily
be
proved
by
production
of
the
registers
so
that
a
permission
to
presume
death
would
result
in
the
handing
over
to
hurst
of
almost
the
entire
estate
who
is
the
executor
i
asked
ah
he
exclaimed
there
is
another
muddle
there
are
two
executors
jellicoe
is
one
and
the
other
is
the
principal
beneficiary
hurst
or
myself
as
the
case
may
be
but
you
see
neither
of
us
can
become
an
executor
until
the
court
has
decided
which
of
us
is
the
principal
beneficiary
but
who
is
to
apply
to
the
court
i
thought
that
was
the
business
of
the
executors
exactly
that
is
hurst
difficulty
we
were
discussing
it
when
you
called
the
other
day
and
a
very
animated
discussion
it
was
he
added
with
a
grim
smile
you
see
jellicoe
naturally
refuses
to
move
in
the
matter
alone
he
says
he
must
have
the
support
of
the
other
executor
but
hurst
is
not
at
present
the
other
executor
neither
am
i
but
the
two
of
us
together
are
the
since
the
duty
devolves
upon
one
or
other
of
us
in
any
case
it
a
complicated
position
i
said
it
is
and
the
complication
has
elicited
a
very
curious
proposal
from
hurst
he
points
out
quite
correctly
i
am
afraid
that
as
the
conditions
as
to
burial
have
not
been
complied
with
the
property
must
come
to
him
and
he
proposes
a
very
neat
little
arrangement
which
is
this
that
i
shall
support
him
and
jellicoe
in
their
application
for
permission
to
presume
death
and
to
administer
the
will
and
that
he
shall
pay
me
four
hundred
a
year
for
life
the
arrangement
to
hold
good
all
what
does
he
mean
by
that
he
means
said
bellingham
fixing
me
with
a
ferocious
scowl
that
if
the
body
should
turn
up
at
any
future
time
so
that
the
conditions
as
to
burial
should
be
able
to
be
carried
out
he
should
still
retain
the
property
and
pay
me
the
four
hundred
a
year
the
deuce
said
i
he
seems
to
know
how
to
drive
a
bargain
his
position
is
that
he
stands
to
lose
four
hundred
a
year
for
the
term
of
my
life
if
the
body
is
never
found
and
he
ought
to
stand
to
win
if
it
is
and
i
gather
that
you
have
refused
this
offer
yes
very
emphatically
and
my
daughter
agrees
with
me
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
have
done
the
right
thing
a
man
should
think
twice
i
suppose
before
he
burns
his
boats
have
you
spoken
to
jellicoe
about
the
matter
yes
i
have
been
to
see
him
he
is
a
cautious
man
and
he
does
advise
me
one
way
or
the
other
but
i
think
he
disapproves
of
my
refusal
in
fact
he
remarked
that
a
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
in
the
bush
especially
when
the
whereabouts
of
the
bush
is
unknown
do
you
think
he
will
apply
to
the
court
without
your
sanction
he
does
want
to
but
i
suppose
if
hurst
puts
pressure
on
him
he
will
have
to
besides
hurst
as
an
interested
party
could
apply
on
his
own
account
and
after
my
refusal
he
probably
will
at
least
that
is
jellicoe
opinion
the
whole
thing
is
a
most
astonishing
muddle
i
said
especially
when
one
remembers
that
your
brother
had
a
lawyer
to
advise
him
did
jellicoe
point
out
to
him
how
absurd
the
provisions
were
yes
he
did
he
tells
me
that
he
implored
my
brother
to
let
him
draw
up
a
will
embodying
the
matter
in
a
reasonable
form
but
john
listen
to
him
poor
old
fellow
he
could
be
very
when
he
chose
and
is
hurst
proposal
still
open
no
thanks
to
my
peppery
temper
i
refused
it
very
definitely
and
sent
him
off
with
a
flea
in
his
ear
i
hope
i
have
not
made
a
false
step
i
was
quite
taken
by
surprise
when
hurst
made
the
proposal
and
got
rather
angry
you
remember
my
brother
was
last
seen
alive
at
hurst
house
but
there
i
ought
to
talk
like
that
and
i
to
pester
you
with
my
confounded
affairs
when
you
come
in
for
a
friendly
chat
though
i
gave
you
fair
warning
you
remember
oh
but
you
have
been
highly
entertaining
you
do
realize
what
an
interest
i
take
in
your
case
bellingham
laughed
somewhat
grimly
my
case
he
repeated
you
speak
as
if
i
were
some
rare
and
curious
sort
of
criminal
lunatic
however
i
glad
you
find
me
amusing
it
more
than
i
find
myself
i
did
say
amusing
i
said
interesting
i
view
you
with
deep
respect
as
the
central
figure
of
a
stirring
drama
and
i
am
not
the
only
person
who
regards
you
in
that
light
do
you
remember
my
speaking
to
you
of
doctor
thorndyke
yes
of
course
i
do
well
oddly
enough
i
met
him
this
afternoon
and
we
had
a
long
talk
at
his
chambers
i
took
the
liberty
of
mentioning
that
i
had
made
your
acquaintance
did
i
do
wrong
no
certainly
not
why
should
you
tell
him
did
he
remember
my
infernal
case
as
you
call
it
perfectly
in
all
its
details
he
is
quite
an
enthusiast
you
know
and
uncommonly
keen
to
hear
how
the
case
develops
so
am
i
for
that
matter
said
bellingham
i
wonder
said
i
if
you
would
mind
my
telling
him
what
you
have
told
me
it
would
interest
him
enormously
bellingham
reflected
for
a
while
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
empty
grate
presently
he
looked
up
and
said
slowly
i
do
know
why
i
should
it
no
secret
and
if
it
were
i
hold
no
monopoly
in
it
no
tell
him
if
you
think
he
care
to
hear
about
it
you
need
be
afraid
of
his
talking
i
said
he
as
close
as
an
oyster
and
the
facts
may
mean
more
to
him
than
they
do
to
us
he
may
be
able
to
give
a
useful
hint
or
two
oh
i
not
going
to
pick
his
brains
bellingham
said
quickly
and
with
some
wrath
i
not
the
sort
of
man
who
goes
round
cadging
for
free
professional
advice
understand
that
doctor
i
do
i
answered
hastily
that
was
what
i
meant
at
all
is
that
miss
bellingham
coming
in
i
heard
the
front
door
shut
yes
that
will
be
my
girl
i
expect
but
do
run
away
you
not
afraid
of
her
are
you
he
added
as
i
hurriedly
picked
up
my
hat
i
not
sure
that
i
not
i
answered
she
is
rather
a
majestic
young
lady
bellingham
chuckled
and
smothered
a
yawn
and
at
that
moment
his
daughter
entered
the
room
and
in
spite
of
her
shabby
black
dress
and
a
shabbier
handbag
that
she
carried
i
thought
her
appearance
and
manner
fully
justified
my
description
you
come
in
miss
bellingham
i
said
as
she
shook
my
hand
with
cool
civility
to
find
your
father
yawning
and
me
taking
my
departure
so
i
have
my
uses
you
see
my
conversation
is
the
infallible
cure
for
insomnia
miss
bellingham
smiled
i
believe
i
am
driving
you
away
she
said
not
at
all
i
replied
hastily
my
mission
was
accomplished
that
was
all
sit
down
for
a
few
moments
doctor
urged
bellingham
and
let
ruth
sample
the
remedy
she
will
be
affronted
if
you
run
away
as
soon
as
she
comes
in
well
you
must
let
me
keep
you
up
i
said
oh
i
let
you
know
when
i
fall
asleep
he
replied
with
a
chuckle
and
with
this
understanding
i
sat
down
again
not
at
all
unwillingly
at
this
moment
miss
oman
entered
with
a
small
tray
and
a
smile
of
which
i
should
not
have
supposed
her
capable
you
take
your
toast
and
cocoa
while
they
hot
dear
wo
you
she
said
coaxingly
yes
i
will
phyllis
thank
you
miss
bellingham
answered
i
am
only
just
going
to
take
off
my
hat
and
she
left
the
room
followed
by
the
astonishingly
transfigured
spinster
she
returned
almost
immediately
as
bellingham
was
in
the
midst
of
a
profound
yawn
and
sat
down
to
her
frugal
meal
when
her
father
mystified
me
considerably
by
remarking
you
late
chick
have
the
shepherd
kings
been
giving
trouble
no
she
replied
but
i
thought
i
might
as
well
get
them
done
so
i
dropped
in
at
the
ormond
street
library
on
my
way
home
and
finished
them
then
they
are
ready
for
stuffing
now
yes
as
she
answered
she
caught
my
astonished
eye
for
a
stuffed
shepherd
king
is
undoubtedly
a
somewhat
surprising
phenomenon
and
laughed
softly
we
must
talk
in
riddles
like
this
she
said
before
doctor
berkeley
or
he
will
turn
us
both
into
pillars
of
salt
my
father
is
referring
to
my
work
she
explained
to
me
are
you
a
taxidermist
then
i
asked
she
hastily
set
down
the
cup
that
she
was
raising
to
her
lips
and
broke
into
a
ripple
of
quiet
laughter
i
am
afraid
my
father
has
misled
you
with
his
irreverent
expressions
he
will
have
to
atone
by
explaining
you
see
doctor
said
bellingham
ruth
is
a
literary
searcher
oh
do
call
me
a
searcher
miss
bellingham
protested
it
suggests
the
female
searcher
at
a
police
station
say
investigator
very
well
investigator
or
investigatrix
if
you
like
she
hunts
up
references
and
bibliographies
at
the
museum
for
people
who
are
writing
books
she
looks
up
everything
that
has
been
written
on
a
given
subject
and
then
when
she
has
crammed
herself
to
a
with
facts
she
goes
to
her
client
and
disgorges
and
crams
him
or
her
and
he
or
she
finally
disgorges
into
the
press
what
a
disgusting
way
to
put
it
said
his
daughter
however
that
is
what
it
amounts
to
i
am
a
literary
jackal
a
collector
of
provender
for
the
literary
lions
is
that
quite
clear
perfectly
but
i
do
think
that
even
now
i
quite
understand
about
the
stuffed
shepherd
kings
oh
it
was
not
the
shepherd
kings
who
were
to
be
stuffed
it
was
the
author
that
was
mere
obscurity
of
speech
on
the
part
of
my
father
the
position
is
this
a
venerable
archdeacon
wrote
an
article
on
the
patriarch
joseph
and
did
know
anything
about
him
interrupted
bellingham
and
got
tripped
up
by
a
specialist
who
did
and
then
got
shirty
nothing
of
the
kind
said
miss
bellingham
he
knew
as
much
as
venerable
archdeacons
ought
to
know
but
the
expert
knew
more
so
the
archdeacon
commissioned
me
to
collect
the
literature
on
the
state
of
egypt
at
the
end
of
the
seventeenth
dynasty
which
i
have
done
and
i
shall
go
and
stuff
him
as
my
father
expresses
it
and
then
and
then
bellingham
interrupted
the
archdeacon
will
rush
forth
and
pelt
that
expert
with
shepherd
kings
and
and
the
whole
and
bobtail
of
the
seventeenth
dynasty
oh
there
be
wigs
on
the
green
i
can
tell
you
yes
i
expect
there
will
be
quite
a
skirmish
said
miss
bellingham
and
thus
dismissing
the
subject
she
made
an
energetic
attack
on
the
toast
while
her
father
refreshed
himself
with
a
colossal
yawn
i
watched
her
with
furtive
admiration
and
deep
and
growing
interest
in
spite
of
her
pallor
her
weary
eyes
and
her
drawn
and
almost
haggard
face
she
was
an
exceedingly
handsome
girl
and
there
was
in
her
aspect
a
suggestion
of
purpose
of
strength
and
character
that
marked
her
off
from
the
rank
and
file
of
womanhood
i
noted
this
as
i
stole
an
occasional
glance
at
her
or
turned
to
answer
some
remark
addressed
to
me
and
i
noted
too
that
her
speech
despite
a
general
undertone
of
depression
was
yet
not
without
a
certain
caustic
ironical
humor
she
was
certainly
a
rather
enigmatical
young
person
but
very
decidedly
interesting
when
she
had
finished
her
repast
she
put
aside
the
tray
and
opening
the
shabby
handbag
asked
do
you
take
any
interest
in
egyptian
history
we
are
as
mad
as
hatters
on
the
subject
it
seems
to
be
a
family
complaint
i
do
know
much
about
it
i
answered
medical
studies
are
rather
engrossing
and
do
leave
much
time
for
general
reading
naturally
she
said
you
ca
specialize
in
everything
but
if
you
would
care
to
see
how
the
business
of
a
literary
jackal
is
conducted
i
will
show
you
my
notes
i
accepted
the
offer
eagerly
not
i
fear
from
pure
enthusiasm
for
the
subject
and
she
brought
forth
from
the
bag
four
quarto
notebooks
each
dealing
with
one
of
the
four
dynasties
from
the
fourteenth
to
the
seventeenth
as
i
glanced
through
the
neat
and
orderly
extracts
with
which
they
were
filled
we
discussed
the
intricacies
of
the
peculiarly
difficult
and
confused
period
that
they
covered
gradually
lowering
our
voices
as
bellingham
eyes
closed
and
his
head
fell
against
the
back
of
his
chair
we
had
just
reached
the
critical
reign
of
apepa
ii
when
a
resounding
snore
broke
in
upon
the
studious
quiet
of
the
room
and
sent
us
both
into
a
fit
of
silent
laughter
your
conversation
has
done
its
work
she
whispered
as
i
stealthily
picked
up
my
hat
and
together
we
stole
on
tiptoe
to
the
door
which
she
opened
without
a
sound
once
outside
she
suddenly
dropped
her
bantering
manner
and
said
quite
earnestly
how
kind
it
was
of
you
to
come
and
see
him
tonight
you
have
done
him
a
world
of
good
and
i
am
most
grateful
she
shook
hands
with
me
really
cordially
and
i
took
my
way
down
the
creaking
stairs
in
a
whirl
of
happiness
that
i
was
quite
at
a
loss
to
account
for
chapter
v
the
barnard
practise
like
most
others
was
subject
to
those
fluctuations
that
fill
the
struggling
practitioner
alternately
with
hope
and
despair
the
work
came
in
paroxysms
with
intervals
of
almost
complete
stagnation
one
of
these
intermissions
occurred
on
the
day
after
my
visit
to
nevill
court
with
the
result
that
by
eleven
i
found
myself
wondering
what
i
should
do
with
the
remainder
of
the
day
the
better
to
consider
this
weighty
problem
i
strolled
down
to
the
embankment
and
leaning
on
the
parapet
contemplated
the
view
across
the
river
the
gray
stone
bridge
with
its
perspective
of
arches
the
picturesque
pile
of
the
and
beyond
the
shadowy
shapes
of
the
abbey
and
stephen
it
was
a
pleasant
scene
restful
and
quiet
with
a
touch
of
life
and
a
hint
of
sober
romance
when
a
barge
swept
down
through
the
middle
arch
of
the
bridge
with
a
lugsail
hoisted
to
a
jury
mast
and
a
woman
at
the
tiller
dreamily
i
watched
the
craft
creep
by
upon
the
moving
tide
noted
the
low
freeboard
almost
awash
the
careful
helmswoman
and
the
dog
on
the
forecastle
yapping
at
the
distant
shore
and
thought
of
ruth
bellingham
what
was
there
about
this
strange
girl
that
had
made
so
deep
an
impression
on
me
that
was
the
question
that
i
propounded
to
myself
and
not
for
the
first
time
of
the
fact
itself
there
was
no
doubt
but
what
was
the
explanation
was
it
her
unusual
surroundings
her
occupation
and
rather
recondite
learning
her
striking
personality
and
exceptional
good
looks
or
her
connection
with
the
dramatic
mystery
of
her
lost
uncle
i
concluded
that
it
was
all
of
these
everything
connected
with
her
was
unusual
and
arresting
but
over
and
above
these
circumstances
there
was
a
certain
sympathy
and
personal
affinity
of
which
i
was
strongly
conscious
and
of
which
i
dimly
hoped
that
she
perhaps
was
a
little
conscious
too
at
any
rate
i
was
deeply
interested
in
her
of
that
there
was
no
doubt
whatever
short
as
our
acquaintance
had
been
she
held
a
place
in
my
thoughts
that
had
never
been
held
by
any
other
woman
from
ruth
bellingham
my
reflections
passed
by
a
natural
transition
to
the
curious
story
that
her
father
had
told
me
it
was
a
queer
affair
that
will
with
the
baffled
lawyer
protesting
in
the
background
it
almost
seemed
as
if
there
must
be
something
behind
it
all
especially
when
i
remembered
hurst
very
singular
proposal
but
it
was
out
of
my
depth
it
was
a
case
for
a
lawyer
and
to
a
lawyer
it
should
go
this
very
night
i
resolved
i
would
go
to
thorndyke
and
give
him
the
whole
story
as
it
had
been
told
to
me
and
then
there
happened
one
of
those
coincidences
at
which
we
all
wonder
when
they
occur
but
which
are
so
frequent
as
to
have
become
enshrined
in
a
proverb
for
even
as
i
formed
the
resolution
i
observed
two
men
approaching
from
the
direction
of
blackfriars
and
recognized
in
them
my
quondam
teacher
and
his
junior
i
was
just
thinking
about
you
i
said
as
they
came
up
very
flattering
replied
jervis
but
i
thought
you
had
to
talk
of
the
devil
perhaps
suggested
thorndyke
he
was
talking
to
himself
but
why
were
you
thinking
of
us
and
what
was
the
nature
of
your
thoughts
my
thoughts
had
reference
to
the
bellingham
case
i
spent
the
whole
of
last
evening
at
nevill
court
ha
and
are
there
any
fresh
developments
yes
by
jove
there
are
bellingham
gave
me
a
full
detailed
description
of
the
will
and
a
pretty
document
it
seems
to
be
did
he
give
you
permission
to
repeat
the
details
to
me
yes
i
asked
specifically
if
i
might
and
he
had
no
objection
whatever
good
we
are
lunching
at
soho
as
polton
has
his
hands
full
come
with
us
and
share
our
table
and
tell
us
your
story
as
we
go
will
that
suit
you
it
suited
me
admirably
in
the
present
state
of
the
practise
and
i
accepted
the
invitation
with
undissembled
glee
very
well
said
thorndyke
then
let
us
walk
slowly
and
finish
with
matters
confidential
before
we
plunge
into
the
maddening
crowd
we
set
forth
at
a
leisurely
pace
along
the
broad
pavement
and
i
commenced
my
narration
as
well
as
i
could
remember
i
related
the
circumstances
that
had
led
up
to
the
present
disposition
of
the
property
and
then
proceeded
to
the
actual
provisions
of
the
will
to
all
of
which
my
two
friends
listened
with
rapt
interest
thorndyke
occasionally
stopping
me
to
jot
down
a
memorandum
in
his
why
the
fellow
must
have
been
a
stark
lunatic
jervis
exclaimed
when
i
had
finished
he
seems
to
have
laid
himself
out
with
the
most
devilish
ingenuity
to
defeat
his
own
ends
that
is
not
an
uncommon
peculiarity
with
testators
thorndyke
remarked
a
direct
and
perfectly
intelligible
will
is
rather
the
exception
but
we
can
hardly
judge
until
we
have
seen
the
actual
document
i
suppose
bellingham
has
a
copy
i
do
know
said
i
but
i
will
ask
him
if
he
has
one
i
should
like
to
look
through
it
said
thorndyke
the
provisions
are
very
peculiar
and
as
jervis
says
admirably
calculated
to
defeat
the
testator
wishes
if
they
have
been
correctly
reported
and
apart
from
that
they
have
a
remarkable
bearing
on
the
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
i
daresay
you
noticed
that
i
noticed
that
it
is
very
much
to
hurst
advantage
that
the
body
has
not
been
found
yes
of
course
but
there
are
some
other
points
that
are
very
significant
however
it
would
be
premature
to
discuss
the
terms
of
the
will
until
we
have
seen
the
actual
document
or
a
certified
copy
if
there
is
a
copy
extant
i
said
i
will
try
to
get
hold
of
it
but
bellingham
is
terribly
afraid
of
being
suspected
of
a
desire
to
get
professional
advice
gratis
that
said
thorndyke
is
natural
enough
and
not
discreditable
but
you
must
overcome
his
scruples
somehow
i
expect
you
will
be
able
to
you
are
a
plausible
young
gentleman
as
i
remember
of
old
and
you
seem
to
have
established
yourself
as
quite
the
friend
of
the
family
they
are
rather
interesting
people
i
explained
very
cultivated
and
with
a
strong
leaning
toward
archeology
it
seems
to
be
in
the
blood
yes
said
thorndyke
a
family
tendency
probably
due
to
contact
and
common
surroundings
rather
than
heredity
so
you
like
godfrey
bellingham
yes
he
is
a
trifle
peppery
and
impulsive
but
quite
an
agreeable
genial
old
buffer
and
the
daughter
said
jervis
what
is
she
like
oh
she
is
a
learned
lady
works
up
bibliographies
and
references
at
the
museum
ah
jervis
exclaimed
with
disfavor
i
know
the
breed
inky
fingers
no
chest
to
speak
of
all
side
and
spectacles
i
rose
artlessly
at
the
gross
and
palpable
bait
you
quite
wrong
i
exclaimed
indignantly
contrasting
hideous
presentment
with
the
comely
original
she
is
an
exceedingly
girl
and
her
manners
all
that
a
lady
should
be
a
little
stiff
perhaps
but
then
i
am
only
an
acquaintance
almost
a
stranger
but
jervis
persisted
what
is
she
like
in
appearance
i
mean
short
fat
sandy
give
us
intelligible
details
i
made
a
rapid
mental
inventory
assisted
by
my
recent
cogitations
she
is
about
five
feet
seven
slim
but
rather
plump
very
erect
in
carriage
and
graceful
in
movements
black
hair
loosely
parted
in
the
middle
and
falling
very
prettily
away
from
the
forehead
pale
clear
complexion
dark
gray
eyes
straight
eyebrows
straight
nose
short
mouth
rather
full
round
chin
what
the
deuce
are
you
grinning
at
jervis
for
my
friend
had
suddenly
unmasked
his
batteries
and
now
threatened
like
the
cheshire
cat
to
dissolve
into
a
mere
abstraction
of
amusement
if
there
is
a
copy
of
that
will
thorndyke
he
said
we
shall
get
it
i
think
you
agree
with
me
reverend
senior
i
have
already
said
was
the
reply
that
i
put
my
trust
in
berkeley
and
now
let
us
dismiss
professional
topics
this
is
our
hostelry
he
pushed
open
an
unpretentious
glazed
door
and
we
followed
him
into
the
restaurant
whereof
the
atmosphere
was
pervaded
by
an
appetizing
meatiness
mingled
with
less
agreeable
suggestions
of
the
destructive
distillation
of
fat
it
was
some
two
hours
later
when
i
wished
my
friends
adieu
under
the
plane
trees
of
king
bench
walk
i
wo
ask
you
to
come
in
now
said
thorndyke
as
we
have
some
consultations
this
afternoon
but
come
in
and
see
us
soon
do
wait
for
that
copy
of
the
will
no
said
jervis
drop
in
in
the
evening
when
your
work
is
done
unless
of
course
there
is
more
attractive
society
elsewhere
oh
you
need
turn
that
color
my
dear
child
we
have
all
been
young
once
there
is
even
a
tradition
that
thorndyke
was
young
some
time
back
in
the
period
do
take
any
notice
of
him
berkeley
said
thorndyke
the
is
sticking
to
his
head
still
he
know
better
when
he
is
my
age
methuselah
exclaimed
jervis
i
hope
i
sha
have
to
wait
as
long
as
that
thorndyke
smiled
benevolently
at
his
irrepressible
junior
and
shaking
my
hand
cordially
turned
into
the
entry
from
the
temple
i
wended
northward
to
the
adjacent
college
of
surgeons
where
i
spent
a
couple
of
profitable
hours
examining
the
pickles
and
refreshing
my
memory
on
the
subjects
of
pathology
and
anatomy
marveling
afresh
as
every
practical
anatomist
must
marvel
at
the
incredibly
perfect
technique
of
the
dissections
and
inwardly
paying
tribute
to
the
founder
of
the
collection
at
length
the
warning
of
the
clock
combined
with
an
increasing
craving
for
tea
drove
me
forth
and
bore
me
toward
the
scene
of
my
not
very
strenuous
labors
my
mind
was
still
occupied
with
the
contents
of
the
cases
and
the
great
glass
jars
so
that
i
found
myself
at
the
corner
of
fetter
lane
without
a
very
clear
idea
of
how
i
had
got
there
but
at
that
point
i
was
aroused
from
my
reflections
rather
abruptly
by
a
raucous
voice
in
my
ear
discovery
at
sidcup
i
turned
wrathfully
for
a
london
yell
let
off
at
range
is
in
effect
like
the
smack
of
an
open
hand
but
the
inscription
on
the
staring
yellow
poster
that
was
held
up
for
my
inspection
changed
my
anger
to
curiosity
horrible
discovery
in
a
now
let
prigs
deny
it
if
they
will
but
there
is
something
very
attractive
in
a
horrible
discovery
it
hints
at
tragedy
at
mystery
at
romance
it
promises
to
bring
into
our
gray
and
commonplace
life
that
element
of
the
dramatic
which
is
the
salt
that
our
existence
is
savored
withal
in
a
too
the
rusticity
of
the
background
seemed
to
emphasize
the
horror
of
the
discovery
whatever
it
might
be
i
bought
a
copy
of
the
paper
and
tucking
it
under
my
arm
hurried
on
to
the
surgery
promising
myself
a
mental
feast
of
watercress
but
as
i
opened
the
door
i
found
myself
confronted
by
a
corpulent
woman
of
piebald
and
pimply
aspect
who
saluted
me
with
a
deep
groan
it
was
the
lady
from
the
coal
shop
in
court
good
evening
jablett
i
said
briskly
not
come
about
yourself
i
hope
yes
i
have
she
answered
rising
and
following
me
gloomily
into
the
and
then
when
i
had
seated
her
in
the
patient
chair
and
myself
at
the
writing
table
she
continued
it
my
inside
you
know
doctor
the
statement
lacked
anatomical
precision
and
merely
excluded
the
domain
of
the
skin
specialist
i
accordingly
waited
for
enlightenment
and
speculated
on
the
while
jablett
regarded
me
expectantly
with
a
dim
and
watery
eye
ah
i
said
at
length
it
your
your
inside
is
it
mrs
jablett
yus
my
she
added
with
a
voluminous
sigh
that
filled
the
apartment
with
odorous
reminiscences
of
unsweetened
your
head
aches
does
it
somethink
chronic
said
jablett
feels
as
if
it
was
and
and
and
when
i
sit
down
i
feel
as
if
i
should
this
picturesque
description
of
her
sensations
not
wholly
inconsistent
with
her
figure
gave
the
clue
to
jablett
sufferings
resisting
a
frivolous
impulse
to
reassure
her
as
to
the
elasticity
of
the
human
integument
i
considered
her
case
in
exhaustive
detail
coasting
delicately
round
the
subject
of
unsweetened
and
finally
sent
her
away
revived
in
spirits
and
grasping
a
bottle
of
mist
sodae
cum
bismutho
from
barnard
big
then
i
went
back
to
investigate
the
horrible
discovery
but
before
i
could
open
the
paper
another
patient
arrived
this
time
affecting
the
wide
and
sublime
of
a
juvenile
fetter
laner
and
then
yet
another
and
so
on
through
the
evening
until
at
last
i
forgot
the
altogether
it
was
only
when
i
had
purified
myself
from
the
evening
consultations
with
hot
water
and
a
and
was
about
to
sit
down
to
a
frugal
supper
that
i
remembered
the
newspaper
and
fetched
it
from
the
drawer
of
the
table
where
it
had
been
hastily
thrust
out
of
sight
i
folded
it
into
a
convenient
form
and
standing
it
upright
against
the
read
the
report
at
my
ease
as
i
supped
there
was
plenty
of
it
evidently
the
reporter
had
regarded
it
as
a
scoop
and
the
editor
had
backed
him
up
with
ample
space
and
horrible
discovery
in
a
at
sidcup
a
startling
discovery
was
made
yesterday
afternoon
in
the
course
of
clearing
out
a
near
the
erstwhile
rural
village
of
sidcup
in
kent
a
discovery
that
will
occasion
many
a
disagreeable
qualm
to
those
persons
who
have
been
in
the
habit
of
regaling
themselves
with
this
refreshing
esculent
but
before
proceeding
to
a
description
of
the
circumstances
of
the
actual
discovery
or
of
the
objects
found
which
however
it
may
be
stated
at
once
are
nothing
more
or
less
than
the
fragments
of
a
dismembered
human
body
it
will
be
interesting
to
trace
the
remarkable
chain
of
coincidences
by
virtue
of
which
the
discovery
was
made
the
beds
in
question
have
been
laid
out
in
a
small
artificial
lake
fed
by
a
tiny
streamlet
which
forms
one
of
the
numerous
tributaries
of
the
river
cray
its
depth
is
greater
than
usual
in
the
otherwise
the
gruesome
relics
could
never
have
been
concealed
beneath
its
surface
and
the
flow
of
water
through
it
though
continuous
is
slow
the
tributary
streamlet
meanders
through
a
succession
of
pasture
meadows
in
one
of
which
the
beds
themselves
are
situated
and
here
throughout
most
of
the
year
the
fleecy
victims
of
the
human
carnivore
carry
on
the
industry
of
converting
grass
into
mutton
now
it
happened
some
years
ago
that
the
sheep
frequenting
these
pastures
became
affected
with
the
disease
known
as
and
here
we
must
make
a
short
digression
into
the
domain
of
pathology
is
a
disease
of
quite
romantic
antecedents
its
cause
is
a
small
flat
worm
the
which
infests
the
liver
and
of
the
affected
sheep
now
how
does
the
worm
get
into
the
sheep
liver
that
is
where
the
romance
comes
in
let
us
see
the
cycle
of
transformation
begins
with
the
deposit
of
the
eggs
of
the
fluke
in
some
shallow
stream
or
ditch
running
through
pasture
lands
now
each
egg
has
a
sort
of
lid
which
presently
opens
and
lets
out
a
minute
hairy
creature
who
swims
away
in
search
of
a
particular
kind
of
the
kind
called
by
naturalists
if
he
finds
a
snail
he
bores
his
way
into
its
flesh
and
soon
begins
to
grow
and
wax
fat
then
he
brings
forth
a
family
of
tiny
worms
quite
unlike
himself
little
creatures
called
which
soon
give
birth
to
families
of
young
so
they
go
on
for
several
generations
but
at
last
there
comes
a
generation
of
which
instead
of
giving
birth
to
fresh
produce
families
of
totally
different
offspring
creatures
like
miniature
tadpoles
called
by
the
learned
the
soon
wriggle
their
way
out
of
the
body
of
the
snail
and
then
complications
arise
for
it
is
the
habit
of
this
particular
snail
to
leave
the
water
occasionally
and
take
a
stroll
in
the
fields
thus
the
escaping
from
the
snail
find
themselves
on
the
grass
whereupon
they
promptly
drop
their
tails
and
stick
themselves
to
the
then
comes
the
unsuspecting
sheep
to
take
his
frugal
meal
and
cropping
the
grass
swallows
it
and
all
but
the
latter
when
they
find
themselves
in
the
sheep
stomach
make
their
way
straight
to
the
up
which
they
travel
to
the
liver
here
in
a
few
weeks
they
grow
up
into
flukes
and
begin
the
important
business
of
producing
eggs
such
is
the
pathological
romance
of
the
and
now
what
is
its
connection
with
this
mysterious
discovery
it
is
this
after
the
outbreak
of
above
referred
to
the
ground
landlord
a
john
bellingham
instructed
his
solicitor
to
insert
a
clause
in
the
lease
of
the
beds
directing
that
the
latter
should
be
periodically
cleared
and
examined
by
an
expert
to
make
sure
that
they
were
free
from
the
noxious
the
last
lease
expired
about
two
years
ago
and
since
then
the
beds
have
been
out
of
cultivation
but
for
the
safety
of
the
adjacent
pastures
it
was
considered
necessary
to
make
the
customary
periodical
inspection
and
it
was
in
the
course
of
cleaning
the
beds
for
this
purpose
that
the
present
discovery
was
made
the
operation
began
two
days
ago
a
gang
of
three
men
proceeded
systematically
to
grub
up
the
plants
and
collect
the
multitudes
of
that
they
might
be
examined
by
the
expert
to
see
if
any
obnoxious
species
were
present
they
had
cleared
nearly
half
of
the
beds
when
yesterday
afternoon
one
of
the
men
working
in
the
deepest
part
came
upon
some
bones
the
appearance
of
which
excited
his
suspicion
thereupon
he
called
his
mates
and
they
carefully
picked
away
the
plants
a
process
that
soon
laid
bare
an
unmistakable
human
hand
lying
on
the
mud
amongst
the
roots
fortunately
they
had
the
wisdom
not
to
disturb
the
remains
but
at
once
sent
off
a
message
to
the
police
very
soon
an
inspector
and
a
sergeant
accompanied
by
the
divisional
surgeon
arrived
on
the
scene
and
were
able
to
view
the
remains
lying
as
they
had
been
found
and
now
another
very
strange
fact
came
to
light
for
it
was
seen
that
the
hand
a
left
one
lying
on
the
mud
was
minus
its
third
finger
this
is
regarded
by
the
police
as
a
very
important
fact
as
bearing
on
the
question
of
identification
seeing
that
the
number
of
persons
having
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
missing
must
be
quite
small
after
a
thorough
examination
on
the
spot
the
bones
were
carefully
collected
and
conveyed
to
the
mortuary
where
they
now
lie
awaiting
further
inquiries
the
divisional
surgeon
brandon
in
an
interview
with
our
representative
made
the
following
statements
bones
are
those
of
the
left
arm
of
a
or
elderly
man
about
five
feet
eight
inches
in
height
all
the
bones
of
the
arm
are
present
including
the
scapula
or
and
the
clavicle
or
but
the
three
bones
of
the
third
finger
are
missing
this
a
deformity
or
has
the
finger
been
cut
off
our
correspondent
asked
finger
has
been
amputated
was
the
reply
it
had
been
absent
from
birth
the
corresponding
hand
bone
or
metacarpal
would
have
been
wanting
or
deformed
whereas
it
is
present
and
quite
normal
long
have
the
bones
been
in
the
water
was
the
next
question
than
a
year
i
should
say
they
are
quite
clean
there
is
not
a
vestige
of
the
soft
structures
left
have
you
any
theory
as
to
how
the
arm
came
to
be
deposited
where
it
was
found
should
rather
not
answer
that
question
was
the
guarded
response
more
question
our
correspondent
urged
ground
landlord
john
bellingham
is
he
not
the
gentleman
who
disappeared
so
mysteriously
some
time
ago
i
understand
brandon
replied
you
tell
me
if
bellingham
had
lost
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
can
not
say
said
brandon
and
he
added
with
a
smile
had
better
ask
the
police
that
is
how
the
matter
stands
at
present
but
we
understand
that
the
police
are
making
active
inquiries
for
any
missing
man
who
has
lost
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
and
if
any
of
our
readers
know
of
such
a
person
they
are
earnestly
requested
to
communicate
at
once
either
with
us
or
the
authorities
also
we
believe
that
a
systematic
search
is
to
be
made
for
further
remains
i
laid
the
newspaper
down
and
fell
into
a
train
of
reflection
it
was
certainly
a
most
mysterious
affair
the
thought
that
had
evidently
come
to
the
reporter
mind
stole
naturally
into
mine
could
these
remains
be
those
of
john
bellingham
it
was
obviously
possible
though
i
could
not
but
see
that
the
fact
of
the
bones
having
been
found
on
his
land
while
it
undoubtedly
furnished
the
suggestion
did
not
in
any
way
add
to
its
probability
the
connection
was
accidental
and
in
nowise
relevant
then
too
there
was
the
missing
finger
no
reference
to
any
such
deformity
had
been
made
in
the
original
report
of
the
disappearance
though
it
could
hardly
have
been
overlooked
but
it
was
useless
to
speculate
without
facts
i
should
be
seeing
thorndyke
in
the
course
of
the
next
few
days
and
undoubtedly
if
the
discovery
had
any
bearing
upon
the
disappearance
of
john
bellingham
i
should
hear
of
it
with
such
a
reflection
i
rose
from
the
table
and
adopting
the
advice
contained
in
the
spurious
johnsonian
quotation
proceeded
to
take
a
walk
in
fleet
street
before
settling
down
for
the
evening
chapter
vi
sidelights
the
association
of
coal
with
potatoes
is
one
upon
which
i
have
frequently
speculated
without
arriving
at
any
more
satisfactory
explanation
than
that
both
products
are
of
the
earth
earthy
of
the
connection
itself
barnard
practise
furnished
several
instances
besides
jablett
establishment
in
court
one
of
which
was
a
dark
and
mysterious
cavern
a
foot
below
the
level
of
the
street
that
burrowed
under
an
ancient
house
on
the
west
side
of
fetter
lane
a
crinkly
timber
house
of
the
type
that
leaned
back
drunkenly
from
the
road
as
if
about
to
sit
down
in
its
own
back
yard
passing
this
repository
of
the
associated
products
about
ten
in
the
morning
i
perceived
in
the
shadows
of
the
cavern
no
less
a
person
than
miss
oman
she
saw
me
at
the
same
moment
and
beckoned
peremptorily
with
a
hand
that
held
a
large
spanish
onion
i
approached
with
a
deferential
smile
what
a
magnificent
onion
miss
oman
and
how
generous
of
you
to
offer
it
to
me
i
was
offering
it
to
you
but
there
is
it
just
like
a
man
is
what
just
like
a
man
i
interrupted
if
you
mean
the
onion
i
do
she
snapped
and
i
wish
you
would
talk
such
a
parcel
of
nonsense
a
grown
man
and
a
member
of
a
serious
profession
too
you
ought
to
know
better
i
suppose
i
ought
i
said
reflectively
and
she
continued
i
called
in
at
the
surgery
just
now
to
see
me
what
else
should
i
come
for
do
you
suppose
that
i
called
to
consult
the
certainly
not
miss
oman
so
you
find
the
lady
doctor
no
use
after
all
miss
oman
gnashed
her
teeth
at
me
and
very
fine
teeth
they
were
too
i
called
she
said
majestically
on
behalf
of
miss
bellingham
my
facetiousness
evaporated
instantly
i
hope
miss
bellingham
is
not
ill
i
said
with
a
sudden
anxiety
that
elicited
a
sardonic
smile
from
miss
oman
no
was
the
reply
she
is
not
ill
but
she
has
cut
her
hand
rather
badly
it
her
right
hand
too
and
she
ca
afford
to
lose
the
use
of
it
not
being
a
great
bulky
lazy
lolloping
man
so
you
had
better
go
and
put
some
stuff
on
it
with
this
advice
miss
oman
whisked
to
the
and
vanished
into
the
depths
of
the
cavern
like
the
witch
of
wokey
while
i
hurried
on
to
the
surgery
to
provide
myself
with
the
necessary
instruments
and
materials
and
thence
proceeded
to
nevill
court
miss
oman
juvenile
maidservant
who
opened
the
door
to
me
stated
the
existing
conditions
with
epigrammatic
conciseness
bellingham
is
hout
sir
but
miss
bellingham
is
hin
having
thus
delivered
herself
she
retreated
toward
the
kitchen
and
i
ascended
the
stairs
at
the
head
of
which
i
found
miss
bellingham
awaiting
me
with
her
right
hand
encased
in
what
looked
like
a
white
i
glad
you
have
come
she
said
phyllis
miss
oman
you
know
has
kindly
bound
up
my
hand
but
i
should
like
you
to
see
that
it
is
all
right
we
went
into
the
where
i
laid
out
my
paraphernalia
on
the
table
while
i
inquired
into
the
particulars
of
the
accident
it
is
most
unfortunate
that
it
should
have
happened
just
now
she
said
as
i
wrestled
with
one
of
those
remarkable
feminine
knots
that
while
they
seem
to
defy
the
utmost
efforts
of
human
ingenuity
to
untie
yet
have
a
singular
habit
of
untying
themselves
at
inopportune
moments
why
just
now
in
particular
i
asked
because
i
have
some
specially
important
work
to
do
a
very
learned
lady
who
is
writing
an
historical
book
has
commissioned
me
to
collect
all
the
literature
relating
to
the
letters
the
cuneiform
tablets
you
know
of
amenhotep
the
fourth
well
i
said
soothingly
i
expect
your
hand
will
soon
be
well
yes
but
that
wo
do
the
work
has
to
be
done
immediately
i
have
to
send
in
completed
notes
not
later
than
this
day
week
and
it
will
be
quite
impossible
i
am
dreadfully
disappointed
by
this
time
i
had
unwound
the
voluminous
wrappings
and
exposed
the
injury
a
deep
gash
in
the
palm
that
must
have
narrowly
missed
a
artery
obviously
the
hand
would
be
useless
for
fully
a
week
i
suppose
she
said
you
could
patch
it
up
so
that
i
could
write
with
it
i
shook
my
head
no
miss
bellingham
i
shall
have
to
put
it
on
a
splint
we
run
any
risks
with
a
deep
wound
like
this
then
i
shall
have
to
give
up
the
commission
and
i
do
know
how
my
client
will
get
the
work
done
in
time
you
see
i
am
pretty
well
up
in
the
literature
of
ancient
egypt
in
fact
i
was
to
receive
special
payment
on
that
account
and
it
would
have
been
such
an
interesting
task
too
however
it
ca
be
helped
i
proceeded
methodically
with
the
application
of
the
dressings
and
meanwhile
reflected
it
was
evident
that
she
was
deeply
disappointed
loss
of
work
meant
loss
of
money
and
it
needed
but
a
glance
at
her
rusty
black
dress
to
see
that
there
was
little
margin
for
that
possibly
too
there
was
some
special
need
to
be
met
her
manner
seemed
almost
to
imply
that
there
was
and
at
this
point
i
had
a
brilliant
idea
i
not
sure
that
it
ca
be
helped
said
i
she
looked
at
me
inquiringly
and
i
continued
i
am
going
to
make
a
proposition
and
i
shall
ask
you
to
consider
it
with
an
open
mind
that
sounds
rather
portentous
said
she
but
i
promise
what
is
it
it
is
this
when
i
was
a
student
i
acquired
the
useful
art
of
writing
shorthand
i
am
not
a
lightning
reporter
you
understand
but
i
can
take
matter
down
from
dictation
at
quite
respectable
speed
yes
well
i
have
several
hours
free
every
day
usually
the
whole
afternoon
up
to
six
or
and
it
occurs
to
me
that
if
you
were
to
go
to
the
museum
in
the
mornings
you
could
get
out
your
books
look
up
passages
you
could
do
that
without
using
your
right
hand
and
put
in
bookmarks
then
i
could
come
along
in
the
afternoon
and
you
could
read
out
the
selected
passages
to
me
and
i
could
take
them
down
in
shorthand
we
should
get
through
as
much
in
a
couple
of
hours
as
you
could
in
a
day
using
oh
but
how
kind
of
you
dr
berkeley
she
exclaimed
how
very
kind
of
course
i
could
think
of
taking
up
all
your
leisure
in
that
way
but
i
do
appreciate
your
kindness
very
much
i
was
rather
chapfallen
at
this
very
definite
refusal
but
persisted
feebly
i
wish
you
would
it
may
seem
rather
a
cheek
for
a
comparative
stranger
like
me
to
make
such
a
proposal
to
a
lady
but
if
you
been
a
man
in
those
special
circumstances
i
should
have
made
it
all
the
same
and
you
would
have
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
i
doubt
that
at
any
rate
i
am
not
a
man
i
sometimes
wish
i
were
oh
i
am
sure
you
are
much
better
as
you
are
i
exclaimed
with
such
earnestness
that
we
both
laughed
and
at
this
moment
bellingham
entered
the
room
carrying
several
large
books
in
a
strap
well
i
sure
he
exclaimed
genially
here
are
pretty
goings
on
doctor
and
patient
giggling
like
a
pair
of
schoolgirls
what
the
joke
he
thumped
his
parcel
of
books
down
on
the
table
and
listened
smilingly
while
my
unconscious
witticism
was
expounded
the
doctor
quite
right
he
said
you
do
as
you
are
chick
but
the
lord
knows
what
sort
of
man
you
would
make
you
take
his
advice
and
let
well
alone
finding
him
in
this
genial
frame
of
mind
i
ventured
to
explain
my
proposition
to
him
and
to
enlist
his
support
he
considered
it
with
attentive
approval
and
when
i
had
finished
turned
to
his
daughter
what
is
your
objection
chick
he
asked
it
would
give
doctor
berkeley
such
a
fearful
lot
of
work
she
answered
it
would
give
him
a
fearful
lot
of
pleasure
i
said
it
would
really
then
why
not
said
bellingham
we
do
mind
being
under
an
obligation
to
the
doctor
do
we
oh
it
is
that
she
exclaimed
hastily
then
take
him
at
his
word
he
means
it
it
is
a
kind
action
and
he
like
doing
it
i
sure
that
all
right
doctor
she
accepts
do
you
chick
yes
if
you
say
so
i
do
and
most
thankfully
she
accompanied
the
acceptance
with
a
gracious
smile
that
was
in
itself
a
large
repayment
on
account
and
when
we
had
made
the
necessary
arrangements
i
hurried
away
in
a
state
of
the
most
perfect
satisfaction
to
finish
my
morning
work
and
order
an
early
lunch
when
i
called
for
her
a
couple
of
hours
later
i
found
her
waiting
in
the
garden
with
the
shabby
handbag
of
which
i
relieved
her
and
we
set
forth
together
watched
jealously
by
miss
oman
who
had
accompanied
her
to
the
gate
as
i
walked
up
the
court
with
this
wonderful
maid
by
my
side
i
could
hardly
believe
in
my
good
fortune
by
her
presence
and
my
own
resulting
happiness
the
mean
surroundings
became
glorified
and
the
commonest
objects
transfigured
into
things
of
beauty
what
a
delightful
thoroughfare
for
instance
was
fetter
lane
with
its
quaint
charm
and
medieval
grace
i
snuffed
the
atmosphere
and
seemed
to
breathe
the
scent
of
the
asphodel
holborn
was
even
as
the
elysian
fields
the
omnibus
that
bore
us
westward
was
a
chariot
of
glory
and
the
people
who
swarmed
verminously
on
the
pavements
bore
the
semblance
of
the
children
of
light
love
is
a
foolish
thing
judged
by
workaday
standards
and
the
thoughts
and
actions
of
lovers
foolish
beyond
measure
but
the
workaday
standard
is
the
wrong
one
after
all
for
the
utilitarian
mind
does
but
busy
itself
with
the
trivial
and
transitory
interests
of
life
behind
which
looms
the
great
and
everlasting
reality
of
the
love
of
man
and
woman
there
is
more
significance
in
a
nightingale
song
in
the
hush
of
a
summer
night
than
in
all
the
wisdom
of
solomon
who
by
the
way
was
not
without
his
little
experiences
of
the
tender
passion
the
janitor
in
the
little
glass
box
by
the
entrance
to
the
library
inspected
us
and
passed
us
on
with
a
silent
benediction
to
the
lobby
whence
when
i
had
handed
my
stick
to
a
demigod
and
received
a
talismanic
disc
in
exchange
we
entered
the
enormous
rotunda
of
the
i
have
often
thought
that
if
some
lethal
vapor
of
highly
preservative
properties
such
as
formaldehyde
for
instance
could
be
shed
into
the
atmosphere
of
this
apartment
the
entire
and
complete
collection
of
books
and
would
be
well
worth
preserving
for
the
enlightenment
of
posterity
as
a
sort
of
anthropological
appendix
to
the
main
collection
of
the
museum
for
surely
nowhere
else
in
the
world
are
so
many
strange
and
abnormal
human
beings
gathered
together
in
one
place
and
a
curious
question
that
must
have
occurred
to
many
observers
is
whence
do
these
singular
creatures
come
and
whither
do
they
go
when
the
very
clock
adjusted
to
literary
eyesight
proclaims
closing
time
the
gentleman
for
instance
with
the
corkscrew
ringlets
that
bob
up
and
down
like
spiral
springs
as
he
walks
or
the
short
elderly
gentleman
in
the
black
cassock
and
bowler
hat
who
shatters
your
nerves
by
turning
suddenly
and
revealing
himself
as
a
woman
whither
do
they
go
one
never
sees
them
elsewhere
do
they
steal
away
at
closing
time
into
the
depths
of
the
museum
and
hide
themselves
until
morning
in
sarcophagi
or
mummy
cases
or
do
they
creep
through
spaces
in
the
and
spend
the
night
behind
the
volumes
in
a
congenial
atmosphere
of
leather
and
antique
paper
who
can
say
what
i
do
know
is
that
when
ruth
bellingham
entered
the
she
appeared
in
comparison
with
these
like
a
creature
of
another
order
even
as
the
head
of
antinous
which
formerly
stood
it
has
since
been
moved
amidst
the
of
the
roman
emperors
seemed
like
the
head
of
a
god
set
in
a
portrait
gallery
of
illustrious
baboons
what
have
we
got
to
do
i
asked
when
we
had
found
a
vacant
seat
do
you
want
to
look
up
the
catalogue
no
i
have
the
tickets
in
my
bag
the
books
are
waiting
in
the
books
department
i
placed
my
hat
on
the
shelf
dropped
her
gloves
into
it
how
delightfully
intimate
and
companionable
it
seemed
altered
the
numbers
on
the
tickets
and
then
we
proceeded
together
to
the
kept
books
desk
to
collect
the
volumes
that
contained
the
material
for
our
day
work
it
was
a
blissful
afternoon
two
and
a
half
hours
of
happiness
unalloyed
did
i
spend
at
that
shiny
desk
guiding
my
nimble
pen
across
the
pages
of
the
notebook
it
introduced
me
to
a
new
world
a
world
in
which
love
and
learning
sweet
intimacy
and
crusted
archeology
were
mingled
into
the
oddest
most
whimsical
and
most
delicious
confection
that
the
mind
of
man
can
conceive
hitherto
these
recondite
histories
had
been
far
beyond
my
ken
of
the
wonderful
heretic
amenhotep
the
fourth
i
had
already
heard
at
the
most
he
had
been
a
mere
name
the
hittites
a
mythical
race
of
undetermined
habitat
while
cuneiform
tablets
had
presented
themselves
to
my
mind
merely
as
an
uncouth
kind
of
fossil
biscuit
suited
to
the
digestion
of
a
prehistoric
ostrich
now
all
this
was
changed
as
we
sat
with
our
chairs
creaking
together
and
she
whispered
the
story
of
those
stirring
times
into
my
receptive
ear
talking
is
strictly
forbidden
in
the
the
disjointed
fragments
arranged
themselves
into
a
romance
of
supreme
fascination
egyptian
babylonian
aramean
hittite
memphis
babylon
hamath
megiddo
i
swallowed
them
all
thankfully
wrote
them
down
and
asked
for
more
only
once
did
i
disgrace
myself
an
elderly
clergyman
of
ascetic
and
acidulous
aspect
had
passed
us
with
a
glance
of
evident
disapproval
clearly
setting
us
down
as
intruding
philanderers
and
when
i
contrasted
the
parson
probable
conception
of
the
whispered
communications
that
were
being
poured
into
my
ear
so
tenderly
and
confidentially
with
the
dry
reality
i
chuckled
aloud
but
my
fair
taskmistress
only
paused
with
her
finger
on
the
page
smilingly
to
rebuke
me
and
then
went
on
with
the
dictation
she
was
certainly
a
tartar
for
work
it
was
a
proud
moment
for
me
when
in
response
to
my
interrogative
yes
my
companion
said
that
is
all
and
closed
the
book
we
had
extracted
the
pith
and
marrow
of
six
considerable
volumes
in
two
and
a
half
hours
you
have
been
better
than
your
word
she
said
it
would
have
taken
me
two
full
days
of
really
hard
work
to
make
the
notes
that
you
have
written
down
since
we
commenced
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
there
no
need
to
i
enjoyed
myself
and
polished
up
my
shorthand
what
is
the
next
thing
we
shall
want
some
books
for
we
yes
i
have
made
out
a
list
so
if
you
will
come
with
me
to
the
catalogue
desk
i
will
look
up
the
numbers
and
ask
you
to
write
the
tickets
the
selection
of
a
fresh
batch
of
authorities
occupied
us
for
another
quarter
of
an
hour
and
then
having
handed
in
the
volumes
that
we
had
squeezed
dry
we
took
our
way
out
of
the
which
way
shall
we
go
she
asked
as
we
passed
out
of
the
gate
where
stood
a
massive
policeman
like
the
guardian
angel
at
the
gate
of
paradise
only
thank
heaven
he
bore
no
flaming
sword
forbidding
we
are
going
i
replied
to
museum
street
where
is
a
milkshop
in
which
one
can
get
an
excellent
cup
of
tea
she
looked
as
if
she
would
have
demurred
but
eventually
followed
obediently
and
we
were
soon
settled
side
by
side
at
the
little
table
retracing
the
ground
we
had
covered
in
the
afternoon
work
and
discussing
various
points
of
interest
over
a
joint
teapot
have
you
been
doing
this
sort
of
work
long
i
asked
as
she
handed
me
my
second
cup
of
tea
professionally
she
answered
only
about
two
years
since
we
broke
up
our
home
in
fact
but
long
before
that
i
used
to
come
to
the
museum
with
my
uncle
john
the
one
who
disappeared
you
know
in
that
dreadfully
mysterious
way
and
help
him
to
look
up
references
we
were
good
friends
he
and
i
i
suppose
he
was
a
very
learned
man
i
suggested
yes
in
a
certain
way
in
the
way
of
the
collector
he
was
very
learned
indeed
he
knew
the
contents
of
every
museum
in
the
world
in
so
far
as
they
were
connected
with
egyptian
antiquities
and
had
studied
them
specimen
by
specimen
consequently
as
egyptology
is
largely
a
museum
science
he
was
a
learned
egyptologist
but
his
real
interest
was
in
things
rather
than
events
of
course
he
knew
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
about
egyptian
history
but
still
he
was
before
all
a
collector
and
what
will
happen
to
his
collection
if
he
is
really
dead
the
greater
part
of
it
goes
to
the
british
museum
by
his
will
and
the
remainder
he
has
left
to
his
solicitor
mr
jellicoe
to
jellicoe
why
what
will
jellicoe
do
with
egyptian
antiquities
oh
he
is
an
egyptologist
too
and
quite
an
enthusiast
he
has
really
a
fine
collection
of
scarabs
and
other
small
objects
such
as
it
is
possible
to
keep
in
a
private
house
i
have
always
thought
that
it
was
his
enthusiasm
for
everything
egyptian
that
brought
him
and
my
uncle
together
on
terms
of
such
intimacy
though
i
believe
he
is
an
excellent
lawyer
and
he
is
certainly
a
very
discreet
cautious
man
is
he
i
should
have
thought
so
judging
by
your
uncle
will
oh
but
that
is
not
jellicoe
fault
he
assures
us
that
he
entreated
my
uncle
to
let
him
draw
up
a
fresh
document
with
more
reasonable
provisions
but
he
says
uncle
john
was
immovable
and
he
really
was
a
rather
obstinate
man
jellicoe
repudiates
any
responsibility
in
the
matter
he
washes
his
hands
of
the
whole
affair
and
says
that
it
is
the
will
of
a
lunatic
and
so
it
is
i
was
glancing
through
it
only
a
night
or
two
ago
and
really
i
can
not
conceive
how
a
sane
man
could
have
written
such
nonsense
you
have
a
copy
then
i
asked
eagerly
remembering
parting
instructions
yes
would
you
like
to
see
it
i
know
my
father
has
told
you
about
it
and
it
is
worth
reading
as
a
curiosity
of
perverseness
i
should
very
much
like
to
show
it
to
my
friend
doctor
thorndyke
i
replied
he
said
he
would
be
interested
to
read
it
and
learn
the
exact
provisions
and
it
might
be
well
to
let
him
and
hear
what
he
has
to
say
about
it
i
see
no
objection
she
rejoined
but
you
know
what
my
father
is
his
horror
i
mean
of
what
he
calls
for
advice
gratis
oh
but
he
need
have
no
scruples
on
that
score
doctor
thorndyke
wants
to
see
the
will
because
the
case
interests
him
he
is
an
enthusiast
you
know
and
he
put
the
request
as
a
personal
favor
to
himself
that
is
very
nice
and
delicate
of
him
and
i
will
explain
the
position
to
my
father
if
he
is
willing
for
doctor
thorndyke
to
see
the
copy
i
will
send
or
bring
it
over
this
evening
have
we
finished
i
regretfully
admitted
that
we
had
and
when
i
had
paid
the
modest
reckoning
we
sallied
forth
turning
back
with
one
accord
into
great
russell
street
to
avoid
the
noise
and
bustle
of
the
larger
thoroughfares
what
sort
of
man
was
your
uncle
i
asked
presently
as
we
walked
along
the
quiet
dignified
street
and
then
i
added
hastily
i
hope
you
do
think
me
inquisitive
but
to
my
mind
he
presents
himself
as
a
kind
of
mysterious
abstraction
the
unknown
quantity
of
a
legal
problem
my
uncle
john
she
answered
reflectively
was
a
very
peculiar
man
rather
obstinate
very
what
people
call
and
decidedly
and
unreasonable
that
is
certainly
the
impression
that
the
terms
of
his
will
convey
i
said
yes
and
not
the
will
only
there
was
the
absurd
allowance
that
he
made
to
my
father
that
was
a
ridiculous
arrangement
and
very
unfair
too
he
ought
to
have
divided
the
property
up
as
my
grandfather
intended
and
yet
he
was
by
no
means
ungenerous
only
he
would
have
his
own
way
and
his
own
way
was
very
commonly
the
wrong
way
i
remember
she
continued
after
a
short
pause
a
very
odd
instance
of
his
and
obstinacy
it
was
a
small
matter
but
very
typical
of
him
he
had
in
his
collection
a
beautiful
little
ring
of
the
eighteenth
dynasty
it
was
said
to
have
belonged
to
queen
ti
the
mother
of
our
friend
amenhotep
the
fourth
but
i
do
think
that
could
have
been
so
because
the
device
on
it
was
the
eye
of
osiris
and
ti
as
you
know
was
an
however
it
was
a
very
charming
ring
and
uncle
john
who
had
a
queer
sort
of
devotion
to
the
mystical
eye
of
osiris
commissioned
a
very
clever
goldsmith
to
make
two
exact
copies
of
it
one
for
himself
and
one
for
me
the
goldsmith
naturally
wanted
to
take
the
measurements
of
our
fingers
but
this
uncle
john
would
not
hear
of
the
rings
were
to
be
exact
copies
and
an
exact
copy
must
be
the
same
size
as
the
original
you
can
imagine
the
result
my
ring
was
so
loose
that
i
could
keep
it
in
my
finger
and
uncle
john
was
so
tight
that
though
he
did
manage
to
get
it
on
he
was
never
able
to
get
it
off
and
it
was
only
the
circumstance
that
his
left
hand
was
decidedly
smaller
than
his
right
that
made
it
possible
for
him
to
wear
it
all
so
you
never
wore
your
copy
no
i
wanted
to
have
it
altered
to
make
it
fit
but
he
objected
strongly
so
i
put
it
away
and
have
it
in
a
box
still
he
must
have
been
an
extraordinarily
old
fellow
i
remarked
yes
he
was
very
tenacious
he
annoyed
my
father
a
good
deal
too
by
making
unnecessary
alterations
in
the
house
in
queen
square
when
he
fitted
up
his
museum
we
have
a
certain
sentiment
with
regard
to
that
house
our
people
have
lived
in
it
ever
since
it
was
built
when
the
square
was
first
laid
out
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
after
whom
it
was
named
it
is
a
dear
old
house
would
you
like
to
see
it
we
are
quite
near
it
now
i
assented
eagerly
if
it
had
been
a
or
a
shop
i
would
still
have
visited
it
with
pleasure
for
the
sake
of
prolonging
our
walk
but
i
was
also
really
interested
in
this
old
house
as
a
part
of
the
background
of
the
mystery
of
the
vanished
john
bellingham
we
crossed
into
cosmo
place
with
its
quaint
row
of
the
now
rare
iron
posts
and
passing
through
stood
for
a
few
moments
looking
into
the
peaceful
stately
old
square
a
party
of
boys
disported
themselves
noisily
on
the
range
of
stone
posts
that
form
a
bodyguard
round
the
ancient
pump
but
otherwise
the
place
was
wrapped
in
dignified
repose
suited
to
its
age
and
station
and
very
pleasant
it
looked
on
this
summer
afternoon
with
the
sunlight
gilding
the
foliage
of
its
widespreading
plane
trees
and
lighting
up
the
brick
of
the
we
walked
slowly
down
the
shady
west
side
near
the
middle
of
which
my
companion
halted
this
is
the
house
she
said
it
looks
gloomy
and
forsaken
now
but
it
must
have
been
a
delightful
house
in
the
days
when
my
ancestors
could
look
out
of
the
windows
through
the
open
end
of
the
square
across
the
fields
of
meadows
to
the
heights
of
hampstead
and
highgate
she
stood
at
the
edge
of
the
pavement
looking
up
with
a
curious
wistfulness
at
the
old
house
a
very
pathetic
figure
i
thought
with
her
handsome
face
and
proud
carriage
her
threadbare
dress
and
shabby
gloves
standing
at
the
threshold
of
the
home
that
had
been
her
family
for
generations
that
should
now
have
been
hers
and
that
was
shortly
to
pass
away
into
the
hands
of
strangers
i
too
looked
up
at
it
with
a
strange
interest
impressed
by
something
gloomy
and
forbidding
in
its
aspect
the
windows
were
shuttered
from
basement
to
attic
and
no
sign
of
life
was
visible
silent
neglected
desolate
it
breathed
an
air
of
tragedy
it
seemed
to
mourn
in
sackcloth
and
ashes
for
its
lost
master
the
massive
door
within
the
splendid
carven
portico
was
crusted
with
grime
and
seemed
to
have
passed
out
of
use
as
completely
as
the
ancient
or
the
rusted
extinguishers
wherein
the
footmen
were
wont
to
quench
their
torches
when
some
bellingham
dame
was
borne
up
the
steps
in
her
gilded
chair
in
the
days
of
good
queen
anne
it
was
in
a
somewhat
sobered
frame
of
mind
that
we
presently
turned
away
and
started
homeward
by
way
of
great
ormond
street
my
companion
was
deeply
thoughtful
relapsing
for
a
while
into
that
somberness
of
manner
that
had
so
impressed
me
when
i
first
met
her
nor
was
i
without
a
certain
sympathetic
pensiveness
as
if
from
the
great
silent
house
the
spirit
of
the
vanished
man
had
issued
forth
to
bear
us
company
but
still
it
was
a
delightful
walk
and
i
was
sorry
when
at
last
we
arrived
at
the
entrance
to
nevill
court
and
miss
bellingham
halted
and
held
out
her
hand
she
said
and
many
many
thanks
for
your
invaluable
help
shall
i
take
the
bag
if
you
want
it
but
i
must
take
out
the
notebooks
why
must
you
take
them
she
asked
why
have
i
got
to
copy
the
notes
out
into
an
expression
of
utter
consternation
spread
over
her
face
in
fact
she
was
so
completely
taken
aback
that
she
forgot
to
release
my
hand
heavens
she
exclaimed
how
idiotic
of
me
but
it
is
impossible
doctor
berkeley
it
will
take
you
hours
it
is
perfectly
possible
and
it
is
going
to
be
done
otherwise
the
notes
would
be
useless
do
you
want
the
bag
no
of
course
not
but
i
am
positively
appalled
had
you
better
give
up
the
idea
and
this
is
the
end
of
our
collaboration
i
exclaimed
tragically
giving
her
hand
a
final
squeeze
whereby
she
became
suddenly
aware
of
its
position
and
withdrew
it
rather
hastily
would
you
throw
away
a
whole
afternoon
work
i
wo
certainly
so
until
i
shall
turn
up
in
the
as
early
as
i
can
you
had
better
take
the
tickets
oh
and
you
wo
forget
about
the
copy
of
the
will
for
doctor
thorndyke
will
you
no
if
my
father
agrees
you
shall
have
it
this
evening
she
took
the
tickets
from
me
and
thanking
me
yet
again
retired
into
the
court
chapter
vii
john
bellingham
will
the
task
upon
which
i
had
embarked
so
when
considered
in
cold
blood
did
certainly
appear
as
miss
bellingham
had
said
rather
appalling
the
result
of
two
and
a
half
hours
pretty
steady
work
at
an
average
speed
of
nearly
a
hundred
words
a
minute
would
take
some
time
to
transcribe
into
longhand
and
if
the
notes
were
to
be
delivered
punctually
on
the
morrow
the
sooner
i
got
to
work
the
better
recognizing
this
truth
i
lost
no
time
but
within
five
minutes
of
my
arrival
at
the
surgery
was
seated
at
the
with
my
copy
before
me
busily
converting
the
sprawling
inexpressive
characters
into
good
legible
the
occupation
was
by
no
means
unpleasant
apart
from
the
fact
that
it
was
a
labor
of
love
for
the
sentences
as
i
picked
them
up
were
fragrant
with
the
reminiscences
of
the
gracious
whisper
in
which
they
had
first
come
to
me
and
then
the
matter
itself
was
full
of
interest
i
was
gaining
a
fresh
outlook
on
life
was
crossing
the
threshold
of
a
new
world
which
was
her
world
and
so
the
occasional
interruptions
from
the
patients
while
they
gave
me
intervals
of
enforced
rest
were
far
from
welcome
the
evening
wore
on
without
any
sign
from
nevill
court
and
i
began
to
fear
that
bellingham
scruples
had
proved
insurmountable
not
i
am
afraid
that
i
was
so
much
concerned
for
the
copy
of
the
will
as
for
the
possibility
of
a
visit
no
matter
howsoever
brief
from
my
fair
employer
and
when
on
the
stroke
of
seven
the
surgery
door
flew
open
with
startling
abruptness
my
fears
were
allayed
and
my
hopes
shattered
simultaneously
for
it
was
miss
oman
who
stalked
in
holding
out
a
blue
foolscap
envelope
with
a
warlike
air
as
if
it
were
an
ultimatum
i
brought
you
this
from
bellingham
she
said
there
a
note
inside
may
i
read
the
note
miss
oman
i
asked
bless
the
man
she
exclaimed
what
else
would
you
do
with
it
is
that
what
it
brought
for
i
supposed
it
was
and
thanking
her
for
her
gracious
permission
i
glanced
through
the
note
a
few
lines
authorizing
me
to
show
the
copy
of
the
will
to
thorndyke
when
i
looked
up
from
the
paper
i
found
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
an
expression
critical
and
rather
disapproving
you
seem
to
be
making
yourself
mighty
agreeable
in
a
certain
quarter
she
remarked
i
make
myself
universally
agreeable
it
is
my
nature
to
ha
she
snorted
do
you
find
me
rather
agreeable
i
asked
oily
said
miss
oman
and
then
with
a
sour
smile
at
the
open
notebooks
she
remarked
you
got
some
work
to
do
now
quite
a
change
for
you
a
delightful
change
miss
oman
satan
findeth
but
no
doubt
you
are
acquainted
with
the
philosophical
works
of
dr
watts
if
you
are
referring
to
hands
she
replied
i
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
do
you
keep
that
hand
idle
any
longer
than
is
really
necessary
i
have
my
suspicions
about
that
splint
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
and
before
i
had
time
to
reply
she
had
taken
advantage
of
the
entrance
of
a
couple
of
patients
to
whisk
out
of
the
surgery
with
the
abruptness
that
had
distinguished
her
arrival
the
evening
consultations
were
considered
to
be
over
by
eight
at
which
time
adolphus
was
wont
with
exemplary
punctuality
to
close
the
outer
door
of
the
surgery
he
was
not
less
prompt
than
usual
and
having
performed
this
his
last
daily
office
and
turned
down
the
surgery
gas
he
reported
the
fact
and
took
his
departure
as
his
retreating
footsteps
died
away
and
the
slamming
of
the
outer
door
announced
his
final
disappearance
i
sat
up
and
stretched
myself
the
envelope
containing
the
copy
of
the
will
lay
on
the
table
and
i
considered
it
thoughtfully
it
ought
to
be
conveyed
to
thorndyke
with
as
little
delay
as
possible
and
as
it
certainly
could
not
be
trusted
out
of
my
hands
it
ought
to
be
conveyed
by
me
i
looked
at
the
notebooks
nearly
two
hours
work
had
made
a
considerable
impression
on
the
matter
that
i
had
to
transcribe
but
still
a
great
deal
of
the
task
yet
remained
to
be
done
however
i
reflected
i
could
put
in
a
couple
of
hours
or
more
before
going
to
bed
and
there
would
be
an
hour
or
two
to
spare
in
the
morning
finally
i
locked
the
notebooks
open
as
they
were
in
the
drawer
and
slipping
the
envelope
into
my
pocket
set
out
for
the
temple
the
soft
chime
of
the
treasury
clock
was
telling
out
in
confidential
tones
the
third
quarter
as
i
rapped
with
my
stick
on
the
forbidding
oak
of
my
friends
chambers
there
was
no
response
nor
had
i
perceived
any
gleam
of
light
from
the
windows
as
i
approached
and
i
was
considering
the
advisability
of
trying
the
laboratory
on
the
next
floor
when
footsteps
on
the
stone
stairs
and
familiar
voices
gladdened
my
ear
hallo
berkeley
said
thorndyke
do
we
find
you
waiting
like
a
peri
at
the
gates
of
paradise
polton
is
upstairs
you
know
tinkering
at
one
of
his
inventions
if
you
ever
find
the
nest
empty
you
had
better
go
up
and
bang
at
the
laboratory
door
he
always
there
in
the
evenings
i
have
been
waiting
long
said
i
and
i
was
just
thinking
of
rousing
him
up
when
you
came
that
was
right
said
thorndyke
turning
up
the
gas
and
what
news
do
you
bring
do
i
see
a
blue
envelope
sticking
out
of
your
pocket
you
do
is
it
a
copy
of
the
will
he
asked
i
answered
yes
and
added
that
i
had
full
permission
to
show
it
to
him
what
did
i
tell
you
exclaimed
jervis
did
i
say
that
he
would
get
the
copy
for
us
if
it
existed
we
admit
the
excellence
of
your
prognosis
said
thorndyke
but
there
is
no
need
to
be
boastful
have
you
read
through
the
document
berkeley
no
i
have
taken
it
out
of
the
envelope
then
it
will
be
equally
new
to
us
all
and
we
shall
see
if
it
tallies
with
your
description
he
placed
three
at
a
convenient
distance
from
the
light
and
jervis
watching
him
with
a
smile
remarked
now
thorndyke
is
going
to
enjoy
himself
to
him
a
perfectly
unintelligible
will
is
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
for
ever
especially
if
associated
with
some
kind
of
recondite
knavery
i
do
know
said
i
that
this
will
is
particularly
unintelligible
the
mischief
seems
to
be
that
it
is
rather
too
intelligible
however
here
it
is
and
i
handed
it
over
to
thorndyke
i
suppose
that
we
can
depend
on
this
copy
said
the
latter
as
he
drew
out
the
document
and
glanced
at
it
oh
yes
he
added
i
see
it
is
copied
by
godfrey
bellingham
compared
with
the
original
and
certified
correct
in
that
case
i
will
get
you
to
read
it
out
slowly
jervis
and
i
will
make
a
rough
copy
for
reference
let
us
make
ourselves
comfortable
and
light
our
pipes
before
we
begin
he
provided
himself
with
a
and
when
we
had
seated
ourselves
and
got
our
pipes
well
alight
jervis
opened
the
document
and
with
a
premonitory
hem
commenced
the
reading
in
the
name
of
god
amen
this
is
the
last
will

and
i
hereby
revoke
all

and
i
appoint
arthur
jellicoe
aforesaid
to
be
the

of
this
my
will
jointly
with
the
principal
beneficiary
and
residuary
legatee
that
is
to

with
the
aforesaid
godfrey

if
the

john

in
the
presence
of
us
present
at
the
same
time
who
at
his
request
and
in
his
presence
and
in
the
presence
of
each
other
have
subscribed
our
names
as
witnesses
frederick
wilton
medford
road
london
clerk
james
barber
wadbury
crescent
london
clerk
well
said
jervis
laying
down
the
document
as
thorndyke
detached
the
last
sheet
from
his
i
have
met
with
a
good
many
idiotic
wills
but
this
one
can
give
them
all
points
i
do
see
how
it
is
ever
going
to
be
administered
one
of
the
two
executors
is
a
mere
abstraction
a
sort
of
algebraical
problem
with
no
answer
i
think
that
difficulty
could
be
overcome
said
thorndyke
i
do
see
how
retorted
jervis
if
the
body
is
deposited
in
a
certain
place
a
is
executor
if
it
is
somewhere
else
b
is
the
executor
but
as
you
can
not
produce
the
body
and
no
one
has
the
least
idea
where
it
is
it
is
impossible
to
prove
either
that
it
is
or
that
it
is
not
in
any
specified
place
you
are
magnifying
the
difficulty
jervis
said
thorndyke
the
body
may
of
course
be
anywhere
in
the
entire
world
but
the
place
where
it
is
lying
is
either
inside
or
outside
the
general
boundary
of
those
two
parishes
if
it
has
been
deposited
within
the
boundary
of
those
two
parishes
the
fact
must
be
ascertainable
by
examining
the
burial
certificates
issued
since
the
date
when
the
missing
man
was
last
seen
alive
and
by
consulting
the
registers
of
those
specified
places
of
burial
i
think
that
if
no
record
can
be
found
of
any
such
interment
within
the
boundary
of
those
two
parishes
that
fact
will
be
taken
by
the
court
as
proof
that
no
such
interment
has
taken
place
and
that
therefore
the
body
must
have
been
deposited
somewhere
else
such
a
decision
would
constitute
george
hurst
the
and
residuary
legatee
that
is
cheerful
for
your
friends
berkeley
jervis
remarked
for
we
may
take
it
as
pretty
certain
that
the
body
has
not
been
deposited
in
any
of
the
places
named
yes
i
agreed
gloomily
i
afraid
there
is
very
little
doubt
of
that
but
what
an
ass
that
fellow
must
have
been
to
make
such
a
about
his
beastly
carcass
what
the
deuce
could
it
have
mattered
to
him
where
it
was
dumped
when
he
had
done
with
it
thorndyke
chuckled
softly
thus
the
irreverent
youth
of
said
he
but
yours
is
hardly
a
fair
comment
berkeley
our
training
makes
us
materialists
and
puts
us
a
little
out
of
sympathy
with
those
in
whom
primitive
beliefs
and
emotions
survive
a
worthy
priest
who
came
to
look
at
our
expressed
surprise
to
me
that
the
students
thus
constantly
in
the
presence
of
relics
of
mortality
should
be
able
to
think
of
anything
but
the
resurrection
and
the
life
hereafter
he
was
a
bad
psychologist
there
is
nothing
so
dead
as
a
and
the
contemplation
of
the
human
body
in
the
process
of
being
quietly
taken
to
pieces
being
resolved
into
its
structural
units
like
a
clock
or
an
old
engine
in
the
scrapper
yard
is
certainly
not
conducive
to
a
vivid
realization
of
the
doctrine
of
the
resurrection
no
but
this
absurd
anxiety
to
be
buried
in
some
particular
place
has
nothing
to
do
with
religious
belief
it
is
merely
silly
sentiment
it
is
sentiment
i
admit
said
thorndyke
but
i
would
call
it
silly
the
feeling
is
so
widespread
in
time
and
space
that
we
must
look
on
it
with
respect
as
something
inherent
in
human
nature
think
as
doubtless
john
bellingham
did
of
the
ancient
egyptians
whose
chief
aspiration
was
that
of
everlasting
repose
for
the
dead
see
the
trouble
they
took
to
achieve
it
think
of
the
great
pyramid
or
that
of
amenhotep
the
fourth
with
its
labyrinth
of
false
passages
and
its
sealed
and
hidden
sepulchral
chambers
think
of
jacob
borne
after
death
all
those
hundreds
of
weary
miles
in
order
that
he
might
sleep
with
his
fathers
and
then
remember
shakespeare
and
his
solemn
adjuration
to
posterity
to
let
him
rest
undisturbed
in
his
grave
no
berkeley
it
is
not
a
silly
sentiment
i
am
as
indifferent
as
you
as
to
what
becomes
of
my
body
i
have
done
with
it
to
use
your
irreverent
phrase
but
i
recognize
the
solicitude
that
some
other
men
display
on
the
subject
as
a
natural
feeling
that
has
to
be
taken
seriously
but
even
so
i
said
if
this
man
had
a
hankering
for
a
freehold
residence
in
some
particular
he
might
have
gone
about
the
business
in
a
more
reasonable
way
there
i
am
entirely
with
you
thorndyke
replied
it
is
the
absurd
way
in
which
this
provision
is
worded
that
not
only
creates
all
the
trouble
but
also
makes
the
whole
document
so
curiously
significant
in
view
of
the
testator
disappearance
how
significant
jervis
demanded
eagerly
let
us
consider
the
provisions
of
the
will
point
by
point
said
thorndyke
and
first
note
that
the
testator
commanded
the
services
of
a
very
capable
lawyer
but
jellicoe
disapproved
of
the
will
said
i
in
fact
he
protested
strongly
against
the
form
of
it
we
will
bear
that
in
mind
too
thorndyke
replied
and
now
with
reference
to
what
we
may
call
the
contentious
clauses
the
first
thing
that
strikes
us
is
their
preposterous
injustice
godfrey
inheritance
is
made
conditional
on
a
particular
disposal
of
the
testator
body
but
this
is
a
matter
not
necessarily
under
godfrey
control
the
testator
might
have
been
lost
at
sea
or
killed
in
a
fire
or
explosion
or
have
died
abroad
and
been
buried
where
his
grave
could
not
have
been
identified
there
are
numerous
probable
contingencies
besides
the
improbable
one
that
has
happened
that
might
prevent
the
body
from
being
recovered
but
even
if
the
body
had
been
recovered
there
is
another
difficulty
the
places
of
burial
in
the
parishes
have
all
been
closed
for
many
years
it
would
be
impossible
to
reopen
any
of
them
without
a
special
faculty
and
i
doubt
whether
such
a
faculty
would
be
granted
possibly
cremation
might
meet
the
difficulty
but
even
that
is
doubtful
and
in
any
case
the
matter
would
not
be
in
the
control
of
godfrey
bellingham
yet
if
the
required
interment
should
prove
impossible
he
is
to
be
deprived
of
his
legacy
it
is
a
monstrous
and
absurd
injustice
i
exclaimed
it
is
thorndyke
agreed
but
this
is
nothing
to
the
absurdity
that
comes
to
light
when
we
consider
clauses
two
and
three
in
detail
observe
that
the
testator
presumably
wished
to
be
buried
in
a
certain
place
also
he
wished
his
brother
should
benefit
under
the
will
let
us
take
the
first
point
and
see
how
he
has
set
about
securing
the
accomplishment
of
what
he
desired
now
if
we
read
clauses
two
and
three
carefully
we
shall
see
that
he
has
rendered
it
virtually
impossible
that
his
wishes
can
be
carried
out
he
desires
to
be
buried
in
a
certain
place
and
makes
godfrey
responsible
for
his
being
so
buried
but
he
gives
godfrey
no
power
or
authority
to
carry
out
the
provision
and
places
insuperable
obstacles
in
his
way
for
until
godfrey
is
an
executor
he
has
no
power
or
authority
to
carry
out
the
provision
and
until
the
provisions
are
carried
out
he
does
not
become
an
executor
it
is
a
preposterous
muddle
exclaimed
jervis
yes
but
that
is
not
the
worst
of
it
thorndyke
continued
the
moment
john
bellingham
dies
his
dead
body
has
come
into
existence
and
it
is
for
the
time
being
wherever
he
happens
to
have
died
but
unless
he
should
happen
to
have
died
in
one
of
the
places
of
burial
mentioned
which
is
in
the
highest
degree
unlikely
his
body
will
be
for
the
time
being
in
some
place
other
than
those
specified
in
that
case
clause
two
is
for
the
time
being
not
complied
with
and
consequently
george
hurst
becomes
automatically
the
but
will
george
hurst
carry
out
the
provisions
of
clause
two
probably
not
why
should
he
the
will
contains
no
instructions
to
that
effect
it
throws
the
whole
duty
on
godfrey
on
the
other
hand
if
he
should
carry
out
clause
two
what
happens
he
ceases
to
be
an
executor
and
he
loses
some
seventy
thousand
pounds
we
may
be
pretty
certain
that
he
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
so
that
on
considering
the
two
clauses
we
see
that
the
wishes
of
the
testator
could
only
be
carried
out
in
the
unlikely
event
of
his
dying
in
one
of
the
mentioned
or
his
body
being
conveyed
immediately
after
death
to
a
public
mortuary
in
one
of
the
said
parishes
in
any
other
event
it
is
virtually
certain
that
he
will
be
buried
in
some
place
other
than
that
which
he
desired
and
that
his
brother
will
be
left
absolutely
without
provision
or
recognition
john
bellingham
could
never
have
intended
that
i
said
clearly
not
agreed
thorndyke
the
provisions
of
the
will
furnish
internal
evidence
that
he
did
not
you
note
that
he
bequeathed
five
thousand
pounds
to
george
hurst
in
the
event
of
clause
two
being
carried
out
but
he
has
made
no
bequest
to
his
brother
in
the
event
of
its
not
being
carried
out
obviously
he
had
not
entertained
the
possibility
of
this
contingency
at
all
he
assumed
as
a
matter
of
course
that
the
conditions
of
clause
two
would
be
fulfilled
and
regarded
the
conditions
themselves
as
a
mere
formality
but
jervis
objected
jellicoe
must
have
seen
the
danger
of
a
miscarriage
and
pointed
it
out
to
his
client
exactly
said
thorndyke
there
is
the
mystery
we
understand
that
he
objected
strenuously
and
that
john
bellingham
was
obdurate
now
it
is
perfectly
understandable
that
a
man
should
adhere
obstinately
to
the
most
stupid
and
perverse
disposition
of
his
property
but
that
a
man
should
persist
in
retaining
a
particular
form
of
words
after
it
has
been
proved
to
him
that
the
use
of
such
form
will
almost
certainly
result
in
the
defeat
of
his
own
wishes
that
i
say
is
a
mystery
that
calls
for
very
careful
consideration
if
jellicoe
had
been
an
interested
party
said
jervis
one
would
have
suspected
him
of
lying
low
but
the
form
of
clause
two
affect
him
at
all
no
said
thorndyke
the
person
who
stands
to
profit
by
the
muddle
is
george
hurst
but
we
understand
that
he
was
unacquainted
with
the
terms
of
the
will
and
there
is
certainly
nothing
to
suggest
that
he
is
in
any
way
responsible
for
it
the
practical
question
is
said
i
what
is
going
to
happen
and
what
can
be
done
for
the
bellinghams
the
probability
is
thorndyke
replied
that
the
next
move
will
be
made
by
hurst
he
is
the
party
immediately
interested
he
will
probably
apply
to
the
court
for
permission
to
presume
death
and
administer
the
will
and
what
will
the
court
do
thorndyke
smiled
dryly
now
you
are
asking
a
very
pretty
conundrum
the
decisions
of
courts
depend
on
idiosyncrasies
of
temperament
that
no
one
can
foresee
but
one
may
say
that
a
court
does
not
lightly
grant
permission
to
presume
death
there
will
be
a
rigorous
inquiry
and
a
decidedly
unpleasant
one
i
suspect
and
the
evidence
will
be
reviewed
by
the
judge
with
a
strong
predisposition
to
regard
the
testator
as
being
still
alive
on
the
other
hand
the
known
facts
point
very
distinctly
to
the
probability
that
he
is
dead
and
if
the
will
were
less
complicated
and
all
the
parties
interested
were
unanimous
in
supporting
the
application
i
do
see
why
it
might
not
be
granted
but
it
will
clearly
be
to
the
interest
of
godfrey
to
oppose
the
application
unless
he
can
show
that
the
conditions
of
clause
two
have
been
complied
with
which
it
is
virtually
certain
he
can
not
and
he
may
be
able
to
bring
forward
reasons
for
believing
john
to
be
still
alive
but
even
if
he
is
unable
to
do
this
inasmuch
as
it
is
pretty
clear
that
he
was
intended
to
be
the
chief
beneficiary
his
opposition
is
likely
to
have
considerable
weight
with
the
court
oh
is
it
i
exclaimed
eagerly
then
that
accounts
for
a
very
peculiar
proceeding
on
the
part
of
hurst
i
have
stupidly
forgotten
to
tell
you
about
it
he
has
been
trying
to
come
to
a
private
agreement
with
godfrey
bellingham
indeed
said
thorndyke
what
sort
of
agreement
his
proposal
was
this
that
godfrey
should
support
him
and
jellicoe
in
an
application
to
the
court
for
permission
to
presume
death
and
to
administer
the
will
that
if
it
was
successful
hurst
should
pay
him
four
hundred
pounds
a
year
for
life
the
arrangement
to
hold
good
in
all
eventualities
by
which
he
means
that
if
the
body
should
be
discovered
at
any
future
time
so
that
the
conditions
of
clause
two
could
be
carried
out
hurst
should
still
retain
the
property
and
continue
to
pay
godfrey
the
four
hundred
a
year
for
life
hey
ho
exclaimed
thorndyke
that
is
a
queer
proposal
a
very
queer
proposal
indeed
not
to
say
fishy
added
jervis
i
do
fancy
the
court
would
look
with
approval
on
that
little
arrangement
the
law
does
not
look
with
much
favor
on
any
little
arrangements
that
aim
at
getting
behind
the
provisions
of
a
will
thorndyke
replied
though
there
would
be
nothing
to
complain
of
in
this
proposal
if
it
were
not
for
the
reference
to
eventualities
if
a
will
is
hopelessly
impracticable
it
is
not
unreasonable
or
improper
for
the
various
beneficiaries
to
make
such
private
arrangements
among
themselves
as
may
seem
necessary
to
avoid
useless
litigation
and
delay
in
administering
the
will
if
for
instance
hurst
had
proposed
to
pay
four
hundred
a
year
to
godfrey
so
long
as
the
body
remained
undiscovered
on
condition
that
in
the
event
of
its
discovery
godfrey
should
pay
him
a
like
sum
for
life
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
comment
upon
it
would
have
been
an
ordinary
sporting
chance
but
the
reference
to
eventualities
is
an
entirely
different
matter
of
course
it
may
be
mere
greediness
but
all
the
same
it
suggests
some
very
curious
reflections
yes
it
does
said
jervis
i
wonder
if
he
has
any
reason
to
expect
that
the
body
will
be
found
of
course
it
does
follow
that
he
has
he
may
be
merely
taking
the
opportunity
offered
by
the
other
poverty
to
make
sure
of
the
bulk
of
the
property
whatever
happens
but
it
is
uncommonly
sharp
practice
to
say
the
least
do
i
understand
that
godfrey
declined
the
proposal
thorndyke
asked
yes
he
did
very
emphatically
and
i
fancy
the
two
gentlemen
proceeded
to
exchange
opinions
on
the
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
with
more
frankness
than
delicacy
ah
said
thorndyke
that
is
a
pity
if
the
case
comes
into
court
there
is
bound
to
be
a
good
deal
of
unpleasant
discussion
and
still
more
unpleasant
comment
in
the
newspapers
but
if
the
parties
themselves
begin
to
express
suspicions
of
one
another
there
is
no
telling
where
the
matter
will
end
no
by
jove
said
jervis
if
they
begin
flinging
accusations
of
murder
about
the
fat
will
be
in
the
fire
with
a
vengeance
that
way
lies
the
old
bailey
we
must
try
to
prevent
them
from
making
an
unnecessary
scandal
said
thorndyke
it
may
be
that
an
exposure
will
be
unavoidable
and
that
must
be
ascertained
in
advance
but
to
return
to
your
question
berkeley
as
to
what
is
to
be
done
hurst
will
probably
make
some
move
pretty
soon
do
you
know
if
jellicoe
will
act
with
him
no
he
wo
he
declines
to
take
any
steps
without
assent
at
least
that
is
what
he
says
at
present
his
attitude
is
one
of
correct
neutrality
that
is
satisfactory
so
far
said
thorndyke
though
he
may
alter
his
tone
when
the
case
comes
into
court
from
what
you
said
just
now
i
gathered
that
jellicoe
would
prefer
to
have
the
will
administered
and
be
quit
of
the
whole
business
which
is
natural
enough
especially
as
he
benefits
under
the
will
to
the
extent
of
two
thousand
pounds
and
a
valuable
collection
consequently
we
may
fairly
assume
that
even
if
he
maintains
an
apparent
neutrality
his
influence
will
be
exerted
in
favor
of
hurst
rather
than
of
bellingham
from
which
it
follows
that
bellingham
ought
certainly
to
be
properly
advised
and
when
the
case
goes
into
court
properly
represented
he
ca
afford
either
the
one
or
the
other
said
i
he
as
poor
as
an
insolvent
church
mouse
and
as
proud
as
the
devil
he
accept
professional
aid
that
he
could
pay
for
h
grunted
thorndyke
that
awkward
but
we
ca
allow
the
case
to
go
default
so
to
speak
to
fail
for
the
mere
lack
of
technical
assistance
besides
it
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
cases
that
i
have
ever
met
with
and
i
am
not
going
to
see
it
bungled
he
object
to
a
little
general
advice
in
a
friendly
informal
way
as
old
brodribb
is
so
fond
of
saying
and
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
us
from
pushing
forward
the
preliminary
inquiries
of
what
nature
would
they
be
well
to
begin
with
we
have
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
the
conditions
of
clause
two
have
not
been
complied
with
that
john
bellingham
has
not
been
buried
within
the
parish
boundaries
mentioned
of
course
he
has
not
but
we
must
not
take
anything
for
granted
then
we
have
to
satisfy
ourselves
that
he
is
not
still
alive
and
accessible
it
is
perfectly
possible
that
he
is
after
all
and
it
is
our
business
to
trace
him
if
he
is
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
jervis
and
i
can
carry
out
these
investigations
without
saying
anything
to
bellingham
my
learned
brother
will
look
through
the
register
of
burials
not
forgetting
the
cremations
in
the
metropolitan
area
and
i
will
take
the
other
matter
in
hand
you
really
think
that
john
bellingham
may
still
be
alive
said
i
since
his
body
has
not
been
found
it
is
obviously
a
possibility
i
think
it
in
the
highest
degree
improbable
but
the
improbable
has
to
be
investigated
before
it
can
be
excluded
it
sounds
a
rather
hopeless
quest
i
remarked
how
do
you
propose
to
begin
i
think
of
beginning
at
the
british
museum
the
people
there
may
be
able
to
throw
some
light
on
his
movements
i
know
that
there
are
some
important
excavations
in
progress
at
heliopolis
in
fact
the
director
of
the
egyptian
department
is
out
there
at
the
present
moment
and
doctor
norbury
who
is
taking
his
place
temporarily
is
an
old
friend
of
bellingham
i
shall
call
on
him
and
try
to
discover
if
there
is
anything
that
might
have
induced
bellingham
suddenly
to
go
abroad
to
heliopolis
for
instance
also
he
may
be
able
to
tell
me
what
it
was
that
took
the
missing
man
to
paris
on
that
last
rather
mysterious
journey
that
might
turn
out
to
be
an
important
clue
and
meanwhile
berkeley
you
must
endeavor
tactfully
to
reconcile
your
friend
to
the
idea
of
letting
us
give
an
eye
to
the
case
make
it
clear
to
him
that
i
am
doing
this
entirely
for
the
enlargement
of
my
own
knowledge
but
wo
you
have
to
be
instructed
by
a
solicitor
i
asked
yes
nominally
but
only
as
a
matter
of
etiquette
we
shall
do
all
the
actual
work
why
do
you
ask
i
was
thinking
of
the
solicitor
costs
and
i
was
going
to
mention
that
i
have
a
little
money
of
my
own
then
you
keep
it
my
dear
fellow
you
want
it
when
you
go
into
practice
there
will
be
no
difficulty
about
the
solicitor
i
shall
ask
one
of
my
friends
to
act
nominally
as
a
personal
favor
to
me
marchmont
would
take
the
case
for
us
jervis
i
am
sure
yes
said
jervis
or
old
brodribb
if
we
put
it
to
him
it
is
excessively
kind
of
both
of
you
to
take
this
benevolent
interest
in
the
case
of
my
friends
i
said
and
it
is
to
be
hoped
that
they
wo
be
foolishly
proud
and
about
it
it
rather
the
way
with
poor
gentlefolk
i
tell
you
what
exclaimed
jervis
i
have
a
most
brilliant
idea
you
shall
give
us
a
little
supper
at
your
rooms
and
invite
the
bellinghams
to
meet
us
then
you
and
i
will
attack
the
old
gentleman
and
thorndyke
shall
exercise
his
persuasive
powers
on
the
lady
these
chronic
incurable
old
bachelors
you
know
are
quite
irresistible
you
observe
that
my
respected
junior
condemns
me
to
lifelong
celibacy
thorndyke
remarked
but
he
added
his
suggestion
is
quite
a
good
one
of
course
we
must
put
any
sort
of
pressure
on
bellingham
to
employ
us
for
that
is
what
it
amounts
to
even
if
we
accept
no
payment
but
a
friendly
talk
over
the
would
enable
us
to
put
the
matter
delicately
and
yet
convincingly
yes
said
i
i
see
that
and
i
like
the
idea
immensely
but
it
wo
be
possible
for
several
days
because
i
got
a
job
that
takes
up
all
my
spare
time
and
that
i
ought
to
be
at
work
on
now
i
added
with
a
sudden
qualm
at
the
way
in
which
i
had
forgotten
the
passage
of
time
in
the
interest
of
thorndyke
analysis
my
two
friends
looked
at
me
inquiringly
and
i
felt
it
necessary
to
explain
about
the
injured
hand
and
the
tablets
which
i
accordingly
did
rather
shyly
and
with
a
nervous
eye
upon
jervis
the
slow
grin
however
for
which
i
was
watching
never
came
on
the
contrary
he
not
only
heard
me
through
quite
gravely
but
when
i
had
finished
said
with
some
warmth
and
using
my
old
hospital
pet
name
i
say
one
thing
for
you
polly
you
a
good
chum
and
you
always
were
i
hope
your
nevill
court
friends
appreciate
the
fact
they
are
far
more
appreciative
than
the
occasion
warrants
i
answered
but
to
return
to
this
question
how
will
this
day
week
suit
you
it
will
suit
me
thorndyke
answered
with
a
glance
at
his
junior
and
me
too
said
the
latter
so
if
it
will
do
for
the
bellinghams
we
will
consider
it
settled
but
if
they
ca
come
you
must
fix
another
night
very
well
i
said
rising
and
knocking
out
my
pipe
i
will
issue
the
invitation
and
now
i
must
be
off
to
have
another
slog
at
those
notes
as
i
walked
homeward
i
speculated
cheerfully
on
the
prospect
of
entertaining
my
friends
under
my
own
or
rather
barnard
roof
if
they
could
be
lured
out
of
their
eremitical
retirement
the
idea
had
in
fact
occurred
to
me
already
but
i
had
been
deterred
by
the
peculiarities
of
barnard
housekeeper
for
gummer
was
one
of
those
housewives
who
make
up
for
an
archaic
simplicity
of
production
by
preparations
on
the
most
portentous
and
alarming
scale
but
this
time
i
would
not
be
deterred
if
only
the
guests
could
be
enticed
into
my
humble
lair
it
would
be
easy
to
furnish
the
raw
materials
of
the
feast
from
outside
and
the
consideration
of
ways
and
means
occupied
me
pleasantly
until
i
found
myself
once
more
at
my
confronted
by
my
voluminous
notes
on
the
incidents
of
the
north
syrian
war
chapter
viii
a
museum
idyll
whether
it
was
that
practise
revived
a
forgotten
skill
on
my
part
or
that
miss
bellingham
had
the
amount
of
work
to
be
done
i
am
unable
to
say
but
whichever
may
have
been
the
explanation
the
fact
is
that
the
fourth
afternoon
saw
our
task
so
nearly
completed
that
i
was
fain
to
plead
that
a
small
remainder
might
be
left
over
to
form
an
excuse
for
yet
one
more
visit
to
the
short
however
as
had
been
the
period
of
our
collaboration
it
had
been
long
enough
to
produce
a
great
change
in
our
relations
to
one
another
for
there
is
no
friendship
so
intimate
and
satisfying
as
that
engendered
by
community
of
work
and
none
between
man
and
woman
at
any
rate
so
frank
and
wholesome
every
day
had
arrived
to
find
a
pile
of
books
with
the
places
duly
marked
and
the
quarto
notebooks
in
readiness
every
day
we
had
worked
steadily
at
the
allotted
task
had
then
handed
in
the
books
and
gone
forth
together
to
enjoy
a
most
companionable
tea
in
the
milkshop
thereafter
to
walk
home
by
way
of
queen
square
talking
over
the
day
work
and
discussing
the
state
of
the
world
in
the
days
when
ahkhenaten
was
kind
transcriber
note
king
and
the
tablets
were
it
had
been
a
pleasant
time
so
pleasant
that
as
i
handed
in
the
books
for
the
last
time
i
sighed
to
think
that
it
was
over
that
not
only
was
the
task
finished
but
that
the
recovery
of
my
fair
patient
hand
from
which
i
had
that
morning
removed
the
splint
had
put
an
end
to
the
need
of
my
help
what
shall
we
do
i
asked
as
we
came
out
into
the
central
hall
it
is
too
early
for
tea
shall
we
go
and
look
at
some
of
the
galleries
why
not
she
answered
we
might
look
over
some
of
the
things
connected
with
what
we
have
been
doing
for
instance
there
is
a
relief
of
ahkhenaten
upstairs
in
the
third
egyptian
room
we
might
go
and
look
at
it
i
fell
in
eagerly
with
the
suggestion
placing
myself
under
her
experienced
guidance
and
we
started
by
way
of
the
roman
gallery
past
the
long
row
of
extremely
commonplace
and
roman
emperors
i
do
know
she
said
pausing
for
a
moment
opposite
a
bust
labelled
trajan
but
obviously
a
portrait
of
phil
may
how
i
am
ever
even
to
thank
you
for
all
that
you
have
done
to
say
nothing
of
repayment
there
is
no
need
to
do
either
i
replied
i
have
enjoyed
working
with
you
so
i
have
had
my
reward
but
still
i
added
if
you
want
to
do
me
a
great
kindness
you
have
it
in
your
power
how
in
connection
with
my
friend
doctor
thorndyke
i
told
you
he
was
an
enthusiast
now
he
is
for
some
reason
most
keenly
interested
in
everything
relating
to
your
uncle
and
i
happen
to
know
that
if
any
legal
proceedings
should
take
place
he
would
very
much
like
to
keep
a
friendly
eye
on
the
case
and
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
i
want
you
if
an
opportunity
should
occur
for
him
to
give
your
father
advice
or
help
of
any
kind
to
use
your
influence
with
your
father
in
favor
of
rather
than
in
opposition
to
his
accepting
it
always
assuming
that
you
have
no
real
feeling
against
his
doing
so
miss
bellingham
looked
at
me
thoughtfully
for
a
few
moments
and
then
laughed
softly
so
the
great
kindness
that
i
am
to
do
you
is
to
let
you
do
me
a
further
kindness
through
your
friend
no
i
protested
that
is
where
you
are
mistaken
it
benevolence
on
doctor
thorndyke
part
it
professional
enthusiasm
she
smiled
sceptically
you
do
believe
in
it
i
said
but
consider
other
cases
why
does
a
surgeon
get
out
of
bed
on
a
winter
night
to
do
an
emergency
operation
at
a
hospital
he
does
get
paid
for
it
do
you
think
it
is
altruism
yes
of
course
is
it
certainly
not
he
does
it
because
it
is
his
job
because
it
is
his
business
to
fight
with
disease
and
win
i
do
see
much
difference
she
said
it
work
done
for
love
instead
of
for
payment
however
i
will
do
as
you
ask
if
the
opportunity
arises
but
i
sha
suppose
that
i
am
repaying
your
kindness
to
me
i
do
mind
so
long
as
you
do
it
i
said
and
we
walked
on
for
some
time
in
silence
is
it
odd
she
said
presently
how
our
talk
always
seems
to
come
back
to
my
uncle
oh
and
that
reminds
me
that
the
things
he
gave
to
the
museum
are
in
the
same
room
as
the
ahkhenaten
relief
would
you
like
to
see
them
of
course
i
should
then
we
will
go
and
look
at
them
first
she
paused
and
then
rather
shyly
and
with
a
rising
color
she
continued
and
i
think
i
should
like
to
introduce
you
to
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
with
your
permission
of
course
this
last
addition
she
made
hastily
seeing
i
suppose
that
i
looked
rather
glum
at
the
suggestion
inwardly
i
consigned
her
friend
to
the
devil
especially
if
of
the
masculine
gender
outwardly
i
expressed
my
felicity
at
making
the
acquaintance
of
any
person
whom
she
should
honor
with
her
friendship
whereat
to
my
discomfiture
she
laughed
enigmatically
a
very
soft
laugh
and
musical
like
the
cooing
of
a
glorified
pigeon
i
strolled
on
by
her
side
speculating
a
little
anxiously
on
the
coming
introduction
was
i
being
conducted
to
the
lair
of
one
of
the
savants
attached
to
the
establishment
and
would
he
add
a
superfluous
third
to
our
little
party
of
two
so
complete
and
companionable
cum
in
this
populated
wilderness
above
all
would
he
turn
out
to
be
a
young
man
and
bring
my
aerial
castles
tumbling
about
my
ears
the
shy
look
and
the
blush
with
which
she
had
suggested
the
introduction
were
ominous
indications
upon
which
i
mused
gloomily
as
we
ascended
the
stairs
and
passed
through
the
wide
doorway
i
glanced
apprehensively
at
my
companion
and
met
a
quiet
inscrutable
smile
and
at
that
moment
she
halted
opposite
a
and
faced
me
this
is
my
friend
she
said
let
me
present
you
to
artemidorus
late
of
the
fayyum
oh
do
smile
she
pleaded
i
am
quite
serious
have
you
never
heard
of
pious
catholics
who
cherish
a
devotion
to
some
saint
that
is
my
feeling
toward
artemidorus
and
if
you
only
knew
what
comfort
he
has
shed
into
the
heart
of
a
lonely
woman
what
a
quiet
unobtrusive
friend
he
has
been
to
me
in
my
solitary
friendless
days
always
ready
with
a
kindly
greeting
on
his
gentle
thoughtful
face
you
would
like
him
for
that
alone
and
i
want
you
to
like
him
and
to
share
our
silent
friendship
am
i
very
silly
very
sentimental
a
wave
of
relief
swept
over
me
and
the
mercury
of
my
emotional
thermometer
which
had
shrunk
almost
into
the
bulb
leaped
up
to
summer
heat
how
charming
it
was
of
her
and
how
sweetly
intimate
to
wish
to
share
this
mystical
friendship
with
me
and
what
a
pretty
conceit
it
was
too
and
how
like
this
strange
inscrutable
maiden
to
come
here
and
hold
silent
converse
with
this
greek
and
the
pathos
of
it
all
touched
me
deeply
amidst
the
joy
of
this
intimacy
are
you
scornful
she
asked
with
a
shade
of
disappointment
as
i
made
no
reply
no
indeed
i
am
not
i
answered
earnestly
i
want
to
make
you
aware
of
my
sympathy
and
my
appreciation
without
offending
you
by
seeming
to
exaggerate
and
i
do
know
how
to
express
it
oh
never
mind
about
the
expression
so
long
as
you
feel
it
i
thought
you
would
understand
and
she
gave
me
a
smile
that
made
me
tingle
to
my
fingertips
we
stood
awhile
gazing
in
silence
at
the
mummy
for
such
indeed
was
her
friend
artemidorus
but
not
an
ordinary
mummy
egyptian
in
form
it
was
entirely
greek
in
feeling
and
brightly
colored
as
it
was
in
accordance
with
the
racial
love
of
color
the
tasteful
refinement
with
which
the
decoration
of
the
case
was
treated
made
those
around
look
garish
and
barbaric
but
the
most
striking
feature
was
a
charming
panel
picture
which
occupied
the
place
of
the
usual
mask
this
painting
was
a
revelation
to
me
except
that
it
was
executed
in
tempera
instead
of
oil
it
differed
in
no
respect
from
modern
work
there
was
nothing
archaic
or
ancient
about
it
with
its
freedom
of
handling
and
its
correct
rendering
of
light
and
shade
it
might
have
been
painted
yesterday
indeed
enclosed
in
an
ordinary
gilt
frame
it
might
have
passed
without
remark
in
an
exhibition
of
modern
portraits
miss
bellingham
observed
my
admiration
and
smiled
approvingly
it
is
a
charming
little
portrait
is
it
she
said
and
such
a
sweet
face
too
so
thoughtful
and
human
with
just
a
shade
of
melancholy
but
the
whole
thing
is
full
of
charm
i
fell
in
love
with
it
the
first
time
i
saw
it
and
it
is
so
greek
yes
it
is
in
spite
of
the
egyptian
gods
and
symbols
rather
because
of
them
i
think
said
she
there
we
have
the
typical
greek
attitude
the
genial
cultivated
eclecticism
that
appreciated
the
fitness
of
even
the
most
alien
forms
of
art
there
is
anubis
standing
beside
the
bier
there
are
isis
and
nephthys
and
there
below
horus
and
tahuti
but
we
ca
suppose
artemidorus
worshiped
or
believed
in
those
gods
they
are
there
because
they
are
splendid
decoration
and
perfectly
appropriate
in
character
the
real
feeling
of
those
who
loved
the
dead
man
breaks
out
in
the
inscription
she
pointed
to
a
band
below
the
pectoral
where
in
gilt
capital
letters
was
written
the
two
words
yes
i
said
it
is
very
dignified
and
very
human
and
so
sincere
and
full
of
real
emotion
she
added
i
find
it
unspeakably
touching
artemidorus
farewell
there
is
the
real
note
of
human
grief
the
sorrow
of
eternal
parting
how
much
finer
it
is
than
the
vulgar
boastfulness
of
the
semitic
epitaphs
or
our
own
miserable
insincere
of
the
lost
but
gone
type
he
was
gone
from
them
for
ever
they
would
look
on
his
face
and
hear
his
voice
no
more
they
realized
that
this
was
their
last
farewell
oh
there
is
a
world
of
love
and
sorrow
in
those
two
simple
words
for
some
time
neither
of
us
spoke
the
glamour
of
this
touching
memorial
of
a
grief
had
stolen
over
me
and
i
was
content
to
stand
silent
by
my
beloved
companion
and
revive
with
a
certain
pensive
pleasure
the
ghosts
of
human
emotions
over
which
so
many
centuries
had
rolled
presently
she
turned
to
me
with
a
frank
smile
you
have
been
weighed
in
the
balance
of
friendship
she
said
and
not
found
wanting
you
have
the
gift
of
sympathy
even
with
a
sentimental
fancies
i
suspected
that
a
good
many
men
would
have
developed
this
precious
quality
under
the
circumstances
but
i
refrained
from
saying
so
there
is
no
use
in
crying
down
one
own
wares
i
was
glad
enough
to
have
earned
her
good
opinion
so
easily
and
when
she
at
length
turned
away
from
the
case
and
passed
through
into
the
adjoining
room
it
was
a
very
complacent
young
man
who
bore
her
company
here
is
ahkhenaten
or
as
the
authorities
here
render
the
hieroglyphics
she
indicated
a
fragment
of
a
colored
relief
labeled
of
a
painted
stone
tablet
with
a
portrait
figure
of
iv
and
we
stopped
to
look
at
the
frail
effeminate
figure
of
the
great
king
with
his
large
cranium
his
queer
pointed
chin
and
the
aten
rays
stretching
out
their
weird
hands
as
if
caressing
him
we
must
stay
here
if
you
want
to
see
my
uncle
gift
because
this
room
closes
at
four
with
this
admonition
she
moved
on
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
she
halted
before
a
large
containing
a
mummy
and
a
large
number
of
other
objects
a
black
label
with
white
lettering
set
forth
the
various
contents
with
a
brief
explanation
as
follows
mummy
of
a
scribe
of
the
dynasty
together
with
the
objects
found
in
the
tomb
these
include
the
four
canopic
jars
in
which
the
internal
organs
were
deposited
the
ushabti
figures
tomb
provisions
and
various
articles
that
had
belonged
to
the
deceased
his
favorite
chair
his
his
inscribed
with
his
name
and
the
name
of
the
king
osorkon
i
in
whose
reign
he
lived
and
other
smaller
articles
presented
by
john
bellingham
esq
they
have
put
all
the
objects
together
in
one
case
miss
bellingham
explained
to
show
the
contents
of
an
ordinary
tomb
of
the
better
class
you
see
that
the
dead
man
was
provided
with
all
his
ordinary
comforts
provisions
furniture
the
that
he
had
been
accustomed
to
use
in
writing
on
papyri
and
a
staff
of
servants
to
wait
on
him
where
are
the
servants
i
asked
the
little
ushabti
figures
she
answered
they
were
the
attendants
of
the
dead
you
know
his
servants
in
the
it
was
a
quaint
idea
was
it
but
it
was
all
very
complete
and
consistent
and
quite
reasonable
too
if
one
once
accepts
the
belief
in
the
persistence
of
the
individual
apart
from
the
body
yes
i
agreed
and
that
is
the
only
fair
way
to
judge
a
religious
system
by
taking
the
main
beliefs
for
granted
but
what
a
business
it
must
have
been
bringing
all
these
things
from
egypt
to
london
it
is
worth
the
trouble
though
for
it
is
a
fine
and
instructive
collection
and
the
work
is
all
very
good
of
its
kind
you
notice
that
the
ushabti
figures
and
the
heads
that
form
the
stoppers
of
the
canopic
jars
are
quite
finely
modeled
the
mummy
itself
too
is
rather
handsome
though
that
coat
of
bitumen
on
the
back
improve
it
but
must
have
been
a
man
the
mask
on
the
face
is
a
portrait
i
suppose
yes
in
fact
it
rather
more
to
some
extent
it
is
the
actual
face
of
the
man
himself
this
mummy
is
enclosed
in
what
is
called
a
cartonnage
that
is
a
case
molded
on
the
figure
the
cartonnage
was
formed
of
a
number
of
layers
of
linen
or
papyrus
united
by
glue
or
cement
and
when
the
case
had
been
fitted
to
a
mummy
it
was
molded
to
the
body
so
that
the
general
form
of
the
features
and
limbs
was
often
apparent
after
the
cement
was
dry
the
case
was
covered
with
a
thin
layer
of
stucco
and
the
face
modeled
more
completely
and
then
decorations
and
inscriptions
were
painted
on
so
that
you
see
in
a
cartonnage
the
body
was
sealed
up
like
a
nut
in
its
shell
unlike
the
more
ancient
forms
in
which
the
mummy
was
merely
rolled
up
and
enclosed
in
a
wooden
coffin
at
this
moment
there
smote
upon
our
ears
a
politely
protesting
voice
announcing
in
tones
that
it
was
closing
time
and
simultaneously
a
desire
for
tea
suggested
the
hospitable
with
leisurely
dignity
that
ignored
the
official
who
shepherded
us
along
the
galleries
we
made
our
way
to
the
entrance
still
immersed
in
conversation
on
matters
sepulchral
it
was
rather
earlier
than
our
usual
hour
for
leaving
the
museum
and
moreover
it
was
our
last
day
for
the
present
wherefore
we
lingered
over
our
tea
to
an
extent
that
caused
the
lady
to
view
us
with
some
disfavor
and
when
at
length
we
started
homeward
we
took
so
many
short
cuts
that
six
found
us
no
nearer
our
destination
than
lincoln
inn
fields
whither
we
had
journeyed
by
a
slightly
indirect
route
that
traversed
among
other
places
russell
square
red
lion
square
with
the
quaint
passage
of
the
same
name
bedford
row
jockey
fields
hand
court
and
great
turnstile
it
was
in
the
last
thoroughfare
that
our
attention
was
attracted
by
a
flaring
poster
outside
a
newsvendor
bearing
the
startling
inscription
more
mementoes
of
murdered
man
miss
bellingham
glanced
at
the
poster
and
shuddered
horrible
is
it
she
said
have
you
read
about
them
i
have
been
noticing
the
papers
the
last
few
days
i
replied
no
of
course
you
have
you
been
slaving
at
those
wretched
notes
we
do
very
often
see
the
papers
at
least
we
do
take
them
in
but
miss
oman
has
kept
us
supplied
during
the
last
day
or
two
she
is
a
perfect
little
ghoul
she
delights
in
horrors
of
every
kind
and
the
more
horrible
the
better
but
i
asked
what
is
it
they
have
found
oh
they
are
the
remains
of
some
poor
creature
who
seems
to
have
been
murdered
and
cut
into
pieces
it
is
dreadful
it
made
me
shudder
to
read
of
it
for
i
could
help
thinking
of
poor
uncle
john
and
as
for
my
father
he
was
really
quite
upset
are
these
the
bones
that
were
found
in
a
at
sidcup
yes
but
they
have
found
several
more
the
police
have
been
most
energetic
they
seem
to
have
been
making
a
systematic
search
and
the
result
has
been
that
they
have
discovered
several
portions
of
the
body
scattered
about
in
very
widely
separated
places
sidcup
lee
mary
cray
and
yesterday
it
was
reported
that
an
arm
had
been
found
in
one
of
the
ponds
called
cuckoo
pits
close
to
our
old
home
what
in
essex
i
exclaimed
yes
in
epping
forest
quite
near
woodford
is
it
dreadful
to
think
of
it
they
were
probably
hidden
when
we
were
living
there
i
think
it
was
that
that
horrified
my
father
so
much
when
he
read
it
he
was
so
upset
that
he
gathered
up
the
whole
bundle
of
newspapers
and
tossed
them
out
of
the
window
and
they
blew
over
the
wall
and
poor
miss
oman
had
to
rush
and
pursue
them
up
the
court
do
you
think
he
suspects
that
these
remains
may
be
those
of
your
uncle
i
think
so
though
he
has
said
nothing
to
that
effect
and
of
course
i
have
not
made
any
suggestion
to
him
we
always
preserve
the
fiction
between
ourselves
of
believing
that
uncle
john
is
still
alive
but
you
do
think
he
is
do
you
no
i
afraid
i
do
and
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
my
father
think
so
either
but
he
does
like
to
admit
it
to
me
do
you
happen
to
remember
what
bones
have
been
found
no
i
do
i
know
that
an
arm
was
found
in
the
cuckoo
pits
and
i
think
a
was
dredged
up
out
of
a
pond
near
mary
cray
but
miss
oman
will
be
able
to
tell
you
all
about
it
if
you
are
interested
she
will
be
delighted
to
meet
a
kindred
spirit
miss
bellingham
added
with
a
smile
i
do
know
that
i
claim
spiritual
kinship
with
a
ghoul
said
i
especially
such
a
very
ghoul
oh
do
disparage
her
doctor
berkeley
miss
bellingham
pleaded
she
is
really
only
a
little
prickly
on
the
surface
i
ought
to
have
called
her
a
ghoul
she
is
just
the
sweetest
most
affectionate
most
unselfish
little
angelic
human
hedgehog
that
you
could
find
if
you
traveled
the
wide
world
through
do
you
know
that
she
has
been
working
her
fingers
to
the
bone
making
an
old
dress
of
mine
presentable
because
she
is
so
anxious
that
i
shall
look
nice
at
your
little
supper
party
you
are
sure
to
do
that
in
any
case
i
said
but
i
withdraw
my
remark
as
to
her
temper
unreservedly
and
i
really
did
mean
it
you
know
i
have
always
liked
the
little
lady
that
right
and
now
wo
you
come
in
and
have
a
few
minutes
chat
with
my
father
we
are
quite
early
in
spite
of
the
short
cuts
i
accepted
readily
and
the
more
so
inasmuch
as
i
wanted
a
few
words
with
miss
oman
on
the
subject
of
catering
and
did
not
want
to
discuss
it
before
my
friends
accordingly
i
went
in
and
gossiped
with
bellingham
chiefly
about
the
work
we
had
done
at
the
museum
until
it
was
time
for
me
to
return
to
the
surgery
having
taken
my
leave
i
walked
down
the
stairs
with
reflective
slowness
and
as
much
creaking
of
my
boots
as
i
could
manage
with
the
result
hopefully
anticipated
that
as
i
approached
the
door
of
miss
oman
room
it
opened
and
the
lady
head
protruded
i
change
my
cobbler
if
i
were
you
she
said
i
thought
of
the
angelic
human
hedgehog
and
nearly
sniggered
in
her
face
i
am
sure
you
would
miss
oman
instantly
though
mind
you
the
poor
fellow
ca
help
his
looks
you
are
a
very
flippant
young
man
she
said
severely
whereat
i
grinned
and
she
regarded
me
silently
with
a
baleful
glare
suddenly
i
remembered
my
mission
and
became
serious
and
sober
miss
oman
i
said
i
very
much
want
to
take
your
advice
on
a
matter
of
some
importance
to
me
at
least
that
ought
to
fetch
her
i
thought
the
advice
fly
strangely
neglected
by
izaak
walton
is
guaranteed
to
kill
in
any
weather
and
it
did
fetch
her
she
rose
in
a
flash
and
gorged
it
cock
feathers
worsted
body
and
all
what
is
it
about
she
asked
eagerly
but
do
stand
out
there
where
everybody
can
hear
but
me
come
in
and
sit
down
now
i
did
want
to
discuss
the
matter
here
and
besides
there
was
not
time
i
therefore
assumed
an
air
of
mystery
i
ca
miss
oman
i
due
at
the
surgery
now
but
if
you
should
be
passing
and
should
have
a
few
minutes
to
spare
i
should
be
greatly
obliged
if
you
would
look
in
i
really
do
quite
know
how
to
act
no
i
expect
not
men
very
seldom
do
but
you
better
than
most
for
you
know
when
you
are
in
difficulties
and
have
the
sense
to
consult
a
woman
but
what
is
it
about
perhaps
i
might
be
thinking
it
over
well
you
know
i
began
evasively
it
a
simple
matter
but
i
very
well
no
by
jove
i
added
looking
at
my
watch
i
must
run
or
i
shall
keep
the
multitude
waiting
and
with
this
i
bustled
away
leaving
her
literally
dancing
with
curiosity
chapter
ix
the
sphinx
of
lincoln
inn
at
the
age
of
one
can
not
claim
to
have
attained
to
the
position
of
a
person
of
experience
nevertheless
the
knowledge
of
human
nature
accumulated
in
that
brief
period
sufficed
to
make
me
feel
confident
that
at
some
time
during
the
evening
i
should
receive
a
visit
from
miss
oman
and
circumstances
justified
my
confidence
for
the
clock
yet
stood
at
two
minutes
to
seven
when
a
premonitory
tap
at
the
surgery
door
heralded
her
arrival
i
happened
to
be
passing
she
explained
and
i
forbore
to
smile
at
the
coincidence
so
i
thought
i
might
as
well
drop
in
and
hear
what
you
wanted
to
ask
me
about
she
seated
herself
in
the
patients
chair
and
laying
a
bundle
of
newspapers
on
the
table
glared
at
me
expectantly
thank
you
miss
oman
said
i
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
look
in
on
me
i
am
ashamed
to
give
you
all
this
trouble
about
such
a
trifling
matter
she
rapped
her
knuckles
impatiently
on
the
table
never
mind
about
the
trouble
she
exclaimed
tartly
what
is
it
that
you
want
to
me
about
i
stated
my
difficulties
in
respect
of
the
and
as
i
proceeded
an
expression
of
disgust
and
disappointment
spread
over
her
countenance
i
do
see
why
you
need
have
been
so
mysterious
about
it
she
said
glumly
i
did
mean
to
be
mysterious
i
was
only
anxious
not
to
make
a
mess
of
the
affair
it
all
very
fine
to
assume
a
lofty
scorn
of
the
pleasures
of
the
table
but
there
is
great
virtue
in
a
really
good
feed
especially
when
and
have
been
the
order
of
the
day
coarsely
put
said
miss
oman
but
perfectly
true
very
well
now
if
i
leave
the
management
to
gummer
she
will
probably
provide
a
tepid
irish
stew
with
flakes
of
congealed
fat
on
it
and
a
plastic
or
something
of
that
kind
and
turn
the
house
upside
down
in
getting
it
ready
so
i
thought
of
having
a
cold
spread
and
getting
the
things
from
outside
but
i
do
want
it
to
look
as
if
i
had
been
making
enormous
preparations
they
wo
think
the
things
came
down
from
heaven
said
miss
oman
no
i
suppose
they
wo
but
you
know
what
i
mean
now
where
do
you
advise
me
to
go
for
the
raw
materials
of
conviviality
miss
oman
reflected
you
had
better
let
me
do
your
shopping
and
manage
the
whole
business
was
her
final
verdict
this
was
precisely
what
i
wanted
and
i
accepted
thankfully
regardless
of
the
feelings
of
gummer
i
handed
her
two
pounds
and
after
some
protests
at
my
extravagance
she
bestowed
them
in
her
purse
a
process
that
occupied
time
since
that
receptacle
besides
being
a
sort
of
miniature
record
office
of
frayed
and
bills
already
bulged
with
a
lading
of
draper
samples
ends
of
tape
a
card
of
linen
buttons
another
of
hooks
and
eyes
a
lump
of
beeswax
a
stump
of
leadpencil
and
other
trifles
that
i
have
forgotten
as
she
closed
the
purse
at
the
imminent
risk
of
wrenching
off
its
fastenings
she
looked
at
me
severely
and
pursed
her
lips
you
a
very
plausible
young
man
she
remarked
what
makes
you
say
that
i
asked
philandering
about
museums
she
continued
with
handsome
young
ladies
on
the
pretense
of
work
work
indeed
oh
i
heard
her
telling
her
father
about
it
she
thinks
you
were
perfectly
enthralled
by
the
mummies
and
dried
cats
and
chunks
of
stone
and
all
the
other
trash
she
does
know
what
humbugs
men
are
really
miss
oman
i
began
oh
do
talk
to
me
she
snapped
i
can
see
it
all
you
impose
upon
me
i
can
see
you
staring
into
those
glass
cases
egging
her
on
to
talk
and
listening
and
and
sitting
at
her
feet
now
did
you
i
do
know
about
sitting
at
her
feet
i
said
though
it
might
easily
have
come
to
that
with
those
infernal
slippery
floors
but
i
had
a
very
jolly
time
and
i
mean
to
go
again
if
i
can
miss
bellingham
is
the
cleverest
and
most
accomplished
woman
i
have
ever
spoken
to
this
was
a
poser
for
miss
oman
whose
admiration
and
loyalty
i
knew
were
only
equaled
by
my
own
she
would
have
liked
to
contradict
me
but
the
thing
was
impossible
to
cover
her
defeat
she
snatched
up
the
bundle
of
newspapers
and
began
to
open
them
out
what
sort
of
stuff
is
she
demanded
suddenly
hibernation
i
exclaimed
yes
they
found
a
patch
of
it
on
a
bone
that
was
discovered
in
a
pond
at
mary
cray
and
a
similar
patch
on
one
that
was
found
at
some
other
place
in
essex
now
i
want
to
know
what
is
you
must
mean
i
said
after
a
moment
reflection
the
newspapers
say
and
i
suppose
they
know
what
they
are
talking
about
if
you
do
know
what
it
is
do
be
ashamed
to
say
so
well
then
i
do
in
that
case
you
had
better
read
the
papers
and
find
out
she
said
a
little
illogically
and
then
are
you
fond
of
murders
i
am
awfully
what
a
shocking
little
ghoul
you
must
be
i
exclaimed
she
stuck
out
her
chin
at
me
i
trouble
you
she
said
to
be
a
little
more
respectful
in
your
language
do
you
realize
that
i
am
old
enough
to
be
your
mother
impossible
i
ejaculated
fact
said
miss
oman
well
anyhow
said
i
age
is
not
the
only
qualification
and
besides
you
are
too
late
for
the
billet
the
vacancy
filled
miss
oman
slapped
the
papers
down
on
the
table
and
rose
abruptly
you
had
better
read
the
papers
and
see
if
you
can
learn
a
little
sense
she
said
severely
as
she
turned
to
go
oh
and
do
forget
the
finger
she
added
eagerly
that
is
really
thrilling
the
finger
i
repeated
yes
they
found
a
hand
with
one
missing
the
police
think
it
is
an
important
clue
i
do
know
what
they
mean
but
you
read
the
account
and
tell
me
what
you
think
with
this
parting
injunction
she
bustled
out
through
the
surgery
and
i
followed
to
bid
her
a
ceremonious
adieu
on
the
doorstep
i
watched
her
little
figure
tripping
with
quick
steps
down
fetter
lane
and
was
about
to
turn
back
into
the
surgery
when
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
evolutions
of
an
elderly
gentleman
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
he
was
a
somewhat
man
tall
gaunt
and
bony
and
the
way
in
which
he
carried
his
head
suggested
to
the
medical
mind
a
pronounced
degree
of
near
sight
and
a
pair
of
deep
spectacle
glasses
suddenly
he
espied
me
and
crossed
the
road
with
his
chin
thrust
forward
and
a
pair
of
keen
blue
eyes
directed
at
me
through
the
centers
of
his
spectacles
i
wonder
if
you
can
and
will
help
me
said
he
with
a
courteous
salute
i
wish
to
call
on
an
acquaintance
and
i
have
forgotten
his
address
it
is
in
some
court
but
the
name
of
that
court
has
escaped
me
for
the
moment
my
friend
name
is
bellingham
i
suppose
you
do
chance
to
know
it
doctors
know
a
great
many
people
as
a
rule
do
you
mean
godfrey
bellingham
ah
then
you
do
know
him
i
have
not
consulted
the
oracle
in
vain
he
is
a
patient
of
yours
no
doubt
a
patient
and
a
personal
friend
his
address
is
court
thank
you
thank
you
oh
and
as
you
are
a
friend
perhaps
you
can
inform
me
as
to
the
customs
of
the
household
i
am
not
expected
and
i
do
not
wish
to
make
an
untimely
visit
what
are
habits
as
to
his
evening
meal
would
this
be
a
convenient
time
to
call
i
generally
make
my
evening
visits
a
little
later
than
this
say
about
eight
they
have
finished
their
meal
by
then
ah
eight
then
then
i
suppose
i
had
better
take
a
walk
until
that
time
i
do
want
to
disturb
them
would
you
care
to
come
in
and
smoke
a
cigar
until
it
is
time
to
make
your
call
if
you
would
i
could
walk
over
with
you
and
show
you
the
house
that
is
very
kind
of
you
said
my
new
acquaintance
with
an
inquisitive
glance
at
me
through
his
spectacles
i
think
i
should
like
to
sit
down
it
a
dull
affair
mooning
about
the
streets
and
there
is
time
to
go
back
to
my
chambers
in
lincoln
inn
i
wonder
said
i
as
i
ushered
him
into
the
room
lately
vacated
by
miss
oman
if
you
happen
to
be
mr
jellicoe
he
turned
his
spectacles
full
on
me
with
a
keen
suspicious
glance
what
makes
you
think
i
am
mr
jellicoe
he
asked
oh
only
that
you
live
in
lincoln
inn
ha
i
see
i
live
in
lincoln
inn
jellicoe
lives
in
inn
therefore
i
am
jellicoe
ha
ha
bad
logic
but
a
correct
conclusion
yes
i
am
jellicoe
what
do
you
know
about
me
mighty
little
excepting
that
you
were
the
late
john
bellingham
man
of
business
the
john
bellingham
hey
how
do
you
know
he
is
the
late
john
bellingham
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
do
only
i
rather
understood
that
that
was
your
own
belief
you
understood
now
from
whom
did
you
that
from
godfrey
bellingham
h
and
how
did
he
know
what
i
believe
i
never
told
him
it
is
a
very
unsafe
thing
my
dear
sir
to
expound
another
man
beliefs
then
you
think
that
john
bellingham
is
alive
do
i
who
said
so
i
did
not
you
know
but
he
must
be
either
dead
or
alive
there
said
jellicoe
i
am
entirely
with
you
you
have
stated
an
undeniable
truth
it
is
not
a
very
illuminating
one
however
i
replied
laughing
undeniable
truths
often
are
not
he
retorted
they
are
apt
to
be
extremely
general
in
fact
i
would
affirm
that
the
certainty
of
the
truth
of
a
given
proposition
is
directly
proportional
to
its
generality
i
suppose
that
is
so
said
i
undoubtedly
take
an
instance
from
your
own
profession
given
a
million
normal
human
beings
under
twenty
and
you
can
say
with
certainty
that
a
majority
of
them
will
die
before
reaching
a
certain
age
that
they
will
die
in
certain
circumstances
and
of
certain
diseases
then
take
a
single
unit
from
that
million
and
what
can
you
predict
concerning
him
nothing
he
may
die
he
may
live
to
be
a
couple
of
hundred
he
may
die
of
a
cold
in
the
head
or
a
cut
finger
or
from
falling
off
the
cross
of
paul
in
a
particular
case
you
can
predict
nothing
that
is
perfectly
true
said
i
and
then
realizing
that
i
had
been
led
away
from
the
topic
of
john
bellingham
i
ventured
to
return
to
it
that
was
a
very
mysterious
affair
the
disappearance
of
john
bellingham
i
mean
why
mysterious
asked
jellicoe
men
disappear
from
time
to
time
and
when
they
reappear
the
explanations
that
they
give
when
they
give
any
seem
more
or
less
adequate
but
the
circumstances
were
surely
rather
mysterious
what
circumstances
asked
jellicoe
i
mean
the
way
in
which
he
vanished
from
hurst
house
in
what
way
did
he
vanish
from
it
well
of
course
i
do
know
precisely
neither
do
i
therefore
i
ca
say
whether
that
way
was
a
mysterious
one
or
not
it
is
not
even
certain
that
he
did
leave
it
i
remarked
rather
recklessly
exactly
said
jellicoe
and
if
he
did
not
he
is
there
still
and
if
he
is
there
still
he
has
not
disappeared
in
the
sense
understood
and
if
he
has
not
disappeared
there
is
no
mystery
i
laughed
heartily
but
jellicoe
preserved
a
wooden
solemnity
and
continued
to
examine
me
through
his
spectacles
which
i
in
my
turn
inspected
and
estimated
at
about
minus
five
dioptres
there
was
something
highly
diverting
about
this
grim
lawyer
with
his
dry
contentiousness
and
almost
farcical
caution
his
ostentatious
reserve
encouraged
me
to
ply
him
with
fresh
questions
the
more
indiscreet
the
better
i
suppose
said
i
that
under
these
circumstances
you
would
hardly
favor
hurst
proposal
to
apply
for
permission
to
presume
death
under
what
circumstances
he
inquired
i
was
referring
to
the
doubt
you
have
expressed
as
to
whether
john
bellingham
is
after
all
really
dead
my
dear
sir
said
he
i
fail
to
see
your
point
if
it
were
certain
that
the
man
was
alive
it
would
be
impossible
to
presume
that
he
was
dead
and
if
it
were
certain
that
he
was
dead
presumption
of
death
would
still
be
impossible
you
do
not
presume
a
certainty
the
uncertainty
is
of
the
essence
of
the
transaction
but
i
persisted
if
you
really
believe
that
he
may
be
alive
i
should
hardly
have
thought
that
you
would
take
the
responsibility
of
presuming
his
death
and
dispersing
his
property
i
do
said
jellicoe
i
take
no
responsibility
i
act
in
accordance
with
the
decision
of
the
court
and
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
but
the
court
may
decide
that
he
is
dead
and
he
may
nevertheless
be
alive
not
at
all
if
the
court
decides
that
he
is
presumably
dead
then
he
is
presumably
dead
as
a
mere
irrelevant
physical
circumstance
he
may
it
is
true
be
alive
but
legally
speaking
and
for
testamentary
purposes
he
is
dead
you
fail
to
perceive
the
distinction
no
doubt
i
am
afraid
i
do
i
admitted
yes
the
members
of
your
profession
usually
do
that
is
what
makes
them
such
bad
witnesses
in
a
court
of
law
the
scientific
outlook
is
radically
different
from
the
legal
the
man
of
science
relies
on
his
own
knowledge
and
observation
and
judgment
and
disregards
testimony
a
man
comes
to
you
and
tells
you
he
is
blind
in
one
eye
do
you
accept
his
statement
not
in
the
least
you
proceed
to
test
his
eyesight
with
some
infernal
apparatus
of
colored
glasses
and
you
find
that
he
can
see
perfectly
well
with
both
eyes
then
you
decide
that
he
is
not
blind
in
one
eye
that
is
to
say
you
reject
his
testimony
in
favor
of
facts
of
your
own
ascertaining
but
surely
that
is
the
rational
method
of
coming
to
a
conclusion
in
science
no
doubt
not
in
law
a
court
of
law
must
decide
according
to
the
evidence
which
is
before
it
and
that
evidence
is
of
the
nature
of
sworn
testimony
if
a
witness
is
prepared
to
swear
that
black
is
white
and
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
is
offered
the
evidence
before
the
court
is
that
black
is
white
and
the
court
must
decide
accordingly
the
judge
and
the
jury
may
think
otherwise
they
may
even
have
private
knowledge
to
the
contrary
but
they
have
to
decide
according
to
the
evidence
do
you
mean
to
say
that
a
judge
would
be
justified
in
giving
a
decision
which
he
knew
to
be
contrary
to
the
facts
or
that
he
might
sentence
a
man
whom
he
knew
to
be
innocent
certainly
it
has
been
done
there
is
a
case
of
a
judge
who
sentenced
a
man
to
death
and
allowed
the
execution
to
take
place
notwithstanding
that
he
the
judge
had
actually
seen
the
murder
committed
by
another
man
but
that
was
carrying
correctness
of
procedure
to
the
verge
of
pedantry
it
was
with
a
vengeance
i
agreed
but
to
return
to
the
case
of
john
bellingham
supposing
that
after
the
court
has
decided
that
he
is
dead
he
should
return
alive
what
then
ah
it
would
then
be
his
turn
to
make
an
application
and
the
court
having
fresh
evidence
laid
before
it
would
probably
decide
that
he
was
alive
and
meantime
his
property
would
have
been
dispersed
probably
but
you
will
observe
that
the
presumption
of
death
would
have
arisen
out
of
his
own
proceedings
if
a
man
acts
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
a
belief
that
he
is
dead
he
must
put
up
with
the
consequences
yes
that
is
reasonable
enough
said
i
and
then
after
a
pause
i
asked
is
there
any
immediate
likelihood
of
proceedings
of
the
kind
being
commenced
i
understood
from
what
you
said
just
now
that
hurst
was
contemplating
some
action
of
the
kind
no
doubt
you
had
your
information
from
a
reliable
quarter
this
answer
jellicoe
delivered
without
moving
a
muscle
regarding
me
with
the
fixity
of
a
spectacled
figurehead
i
smiled
feebly
the
operation
of
pumping
jellicoe
was
rather
like
the
sport
of
boxing
with
a
porcupine
being
chiefly
remarkable
as
a
demonstration
of
the
power
of
passive
resistance
i
determined
however
to
make
one
more
effort
rather
i
think
for
the
pleasure
of
witnessing
his
defensive
maneuvers
than
with
the
expectation
of
getting
anything
out
of
him
i
accordingly
opened
out
on
the
subject
of
the
remains
have
you
been
following
these
remarkable
discoveries
of
human
bones
that
have
been
appearing
in
the
papers
i
asked
he
looked
at
me
stonily
for
some
moments
and
then
replied
human
bones
are
rather
more
within
your
province
than
mine
but
now
that
you
mention
it
i
think
i
recall
having
read
of
some
such
discoveries
they
were
disconnected
bones
i
believe
yes
evidently
parts
of
a
dismembered
body
so
i
should
suppose
no
i
have
not
followed
the
accounts
as
we
get
on
in
life
our
interests
tend
to
settle
into
grooves
and
my
groove
is
chiefly
connected
with
conveyancing
these
discoveries
would
be
of
more
interest
to
a
criminal
lawyer
i
thought
you
might
perhaps
have
connected
them
with
the
disappearance
of
your
client
why
should
i
what
could
be
the
nature
of
the
connection
well
i
said
these
are
the
bones
of
a
man
yes
and
my
client
was
a
man
with
bones
that
is
a
connection
certainly
though
not
a
very
specific
or
distinctive
one
but
perhaps
you
had
something
more
particular
in
your
mind
i
had
i
replied
the
fact
that
some
of
the
bones
were
actually
found
on
land
belonging
to
your
client
seemed
to
me
rather
significant
did
it
indeed
said
jellicoe
he
reflected
for
a
few
moments
gazing
steadily
at
me
the
while
and
then
continued
in
that
i
am
unable
to
follow
you
it
would
have
seemed
to
me
that
the
finding
of
human
remains
upon
a
certain
piece
of
land
might
conceivably
throw
a
suspicion
upon
the
owner
or
occupant
of
the
land
as
being
the
person
who
deposited
them
but
the
case
that
you
suggest
is
the
one
case
in
which
this
would
be
impossible
a
man
can
not
deposit
his
own
dismembered
remains
no
of
course
not
i
was
not
suggesting
that
he
deposited
them
himself
but
merely
that
the
fact
of
their
being
deposited
on
his
land
in
a
way
connected
these
remains
with
him
again
said
jellicoe
i
fail
to
follow
you
unless
you
are
suggesting
that
it
is
customary
for
murderers
who
mutilate
bodies
to
be
punctilious
in
depositing
the
dismembered
remains
upon
land
belonging
to
their
victims
in
which
case
i
am
skeptical
as
to
your
facts
i
am
not
aware
of
the
existence
of
any
such
custom
moreover
it
appears
that
only
a
portion
of
the
body
was
deposited
on
bellingham
land
the
remaining
portions
having
been
scattered
broadcast
over
a
wide
area
how
does
that
agree
with
your
suggestion
it
does
of
course
i
admitted
but
there
is
another
fact
that
i
think
you
will
admit
to
be
more
significant
the
first
remains
that
were
discovered
were
found
at
sidcup
now
sidcup
is
close
to
eltham
and
eltham
is
the
place
where
bellingham
was
last
seen
alive
and
what
is
the
significance
of
this
why
do
you
connect
the
remains
with
one
locality
rather
than
the
various
other
localities
in
which
other
portions
of
the
body
were
found
well
i
replied
rather
graveled
by
this
very
pertinent
question
the
appearances
seem
to
suggest
that
the
person
who
deposited
these
remains
started
from
the
neighborhood
of
eltham
where
the
missing
man
was
last
seen
jellicoe
shook
his
head
you
appear
said
he
to
be
confusing
the
order
of
deposition
with
the
order
of
discovery
what
evidence
is
there
that
the
remains
found
at
sidcup
were
deposited
before
those
found
elsewhere
i
do
know
that
there
is
any
i
admitted
then
said
he
i
do
see
how
you
support
your
suggestion
that
the
person
started
from
the
neighborhood
of
eltham
on
consideration
i
had
to
admit
that
i
had
nothing
to
offer
in
support
of
my
theory
and
having
thus
shot
my
last
arrow
in
this
very
unequal
contest
i
thought
it
time
to
change
the
subject
i
called
in
at
the
british
museum
the
other
day
said
i
and
had
a
look
at
bellingham
last
gift
to
the
nation
the
things
are
very
well
shown
in
that
central
case
yes
i
was
very
pleased
with
the
position
they
have
given
to
the
exhibit
and
so
would
my
poor
old
friend
have
been
i
wished
as
i
looked
at
the
case
that
he
could
have
seen
it
but
perhaps
he
may
after
all
i
am
sure
i
hope
he
will
said
i
with
more
sincerity
perhaps
than
the
lawyer
gave
me
credit
for
for
the
return
of
john
bellingham
would
most
effectually
have
cut
the
gordian
knot
of
my
friend
difficulties
you
are
a
good
deal
interested
in
egyptology
yourself
are
you
i
added
greatly
interested
replied
jellicoe
with
more
animation
than
i
had
thought
possible
in
his
wooden
face
it
is
a
fascinating
subject
the
study
of
this
venerable
civilization
extending
back
to
the
childhood
of
the
human
race
preserved
for
ever
for
our
instruction
in
its
own
unchanging
monuments
like
a
fly
in
a
block
of
amber
everything
connected
with
egypt
is
full
of
an
impressive
solemnity
a
feeling
of
permanence
of
stability
defying
time
and
change
pervades
it
the
place
the
people
and
the
monuments
alike
breathe
of
eternity
i
was
mightily
surprised
at
this
rhetorical
outburst
on
the
part
of
this
dry
taciturn
lawyer
but
i
liked
him
the
better
for
the
touch
of
enthusiasm
that
made
him
human
and
determined
to
keep
him
astride
of
his
hobby
yet
said
i
the
people
must
have
changed
in
the
course
of
centuries
yes
that
is
so
the
people
who
fought
against
cambyses
were
not
the
race
who
marched
into
egypt
five
thousand
years
before
the
dynastic
people
whose
portraits
we
see
on
the
early
monuments
in
those
fifty
centuries
the
blood
of
hyksos
and
syrians
and
ethiopians
and
hittites
and
who
can
say
how
many
more
races
must
have
mingled
with
that
of
the
old
egyptians
but
still
the
national
life
went
on
without
a
break
the
old
culture
leavened
the
new
peoples
and
the
immigrant
strangers
ended
by
becoming
egyptians
it
is
a
wonderful
phenomenon
looking
back
on
it
from
our
own
time
it
seems
more
like
a
geological
period
than
the
life
history
of
a
single
nation
are
you
at
all
interested
in
the
subject
yes
decidedly
though
i
am
completely
ignorant
of
it
the
fact
is
that
my
interest
is
of
quite
recent
growth
it
is
only
of
late
that
i
have
been
sensible
of
the
glamor
of
things
egyptian
since
you
made
miss
bellingham
acquaintance
perhaps
suggested
jellicoe
himself
as
unchanging
in
aspect
as
an
egyptian
effigy
i
suppose
i
must
have
reddened
i
certainly
resented
the
remark
for
he
continued
in
the
same
even
tone
i
made
the
suggestion
because
i
know
that
she
takes
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
subject
and
is
in
fact
quite
well
informed
on
it
yes
she
seems
to
know
a
great
deal
about
the
antiquities
of
egypt
and
i
may
as
well
admit
that
your
surmise
was
correct
it
was
she
who
showed
me
her
uncle
collection
so
i
had
supposed
said
jellicoe
and
a
very
instructive
collection
it
is
in
a
popular
sense
very
suitable
for
exhibition
in
a
public
museum
though
there
is
nothing
in
it
of
unusual
interest
to
the
expert
the
tomb
furniture
is
excellent
of
its
kind
and
the
cartonnage
case
of
the
mummy
is
well
made
and
rather
finely
decorated
yes
i
thought
it
quite
handsome
but
can
you
explain
to
me
why
after
taking
all
that
trouble
to
decorate
it
they
should
have
disfigured
it
with
those
great
smears
of
bitumen
ah
said
jellicoe
that
is
quite
an
interesting
question
it
is
not
unusual
to
find
mummy
cases
smeared
with
bitumen
there
is
a
mummy
of
a
priestess
in
the
next
gallery
which
is
completely
coated
with
bitumen
except
the
gilded
face
now
this
bitumen
was
put
on
for
a
purpose
for
the
purpose
of
obliterating
the
inscriptions
and
thus
concealing
the
identity
of
the
deceased
from
the
robbers
and
desecrators
of
tombs
and
there
is
the
oddity
of
this
mummy
of
evidently
there
was
an
intention
of
obliterating
the
inscriptions
the
whole
of
the
back
is
covered
thickly
with
bitumen
and
so
are
the
feet
then
the
workers
seem
to
have
changed
their
minds
and
left
the
inscriptions
and
decoration
untouched
why
they
intended
to
cover
it
and
why
having
commenced
they
left
it
partially
covered
only
is
a
mystery
the
mummy
was
found
in
its
original
tomb
and
quite
undisturbed
so
far
as
are
concerned
poor
bellingham
was
greatly
puzzled
as
to
what
the
explanation
could
be
speaking
of
bitumen
said
i
reminds
me
of
a
question
that
has
occurred
to
me
you
know
that
this
substance
has
been
used
a
good
deal
by
modern
painters
and
that
it
has
a
very
dangerous
peculiarity
i
mean
its
tendency
to
liquefy
without
any
obvious
reason
long
after
it
has
dried
yes
i
know
is
there
some
story
about
a
picture
of
reynolds
in
which
bitumen
had
been
used
a
portrait
of
a
lady
i
think
the
bitumen
softened
and
one
of
the
lady
eyes
slipped
down
on
to
her
cheek
and
they
had
to
hang
the
portrait
upside
down
and
keep
it
warm
until
the
eye
slipped
back
again
into
its
place
but
what
was
your
question
i
was
wondering
whether
the
bitumen
used
by
the
egyptian
artists
has
ever
been
known
to
soften
after
this
great
lapse
of
time
yes
i
think
it
has
i
have
heard
of
instances
in
which
the
bitumen
coatings
have
softened
under
certain
circumstances
and
become
quite
but
bless
my
soul
here
am
i
gossiping
with
you
and
wasting
your
time
and
it
is
nearly
a
quarter
to
nine
my
guest
rose
hastily
and
i
with
many
apologies
for
having
detained
him
proceeded
to
fulfil
my
promise
to
guide
him
to
his
destination
as
we
sallied
forth
together
the
glamour
of
egypt
faded
by
degrees
and
when
he
shook
my
hand
stiffly
at
the
gate
of
the
bellinghams
house
all
his
vivacity
and
enthusiasm
had
vanished
leaving
the
taciturn
lawyer
dry
uncommunicative
and
not
a
little
suspicious
chapter
x
the
new
alliance
the
great
lexicographer
tutelary
deity
of
my
adopted
habitat
has
handed
down
to
shuddering
posterity
a
definition
of
the
act
of
eating
which
might
have
been
framed
by
a
dyspeptic
ghoul
eat
to
devour
with
the
mouth
it
is
a
shocking
view
to
take
of
so
genial
a
function
cynical
indelicate
and
finally
unforgivable
by
reason
of
its
very
accuracy
for
after
all
that
is
what
eating
amounts
to
if
one
must
needs
express
it
with
such
crude
brutality
but
if
the
ingestion
of
alimentary
substances
to
ring
a
modern
change
upon
the
older
formula
is
in
itself
a
process
material
even
unto
carnality
it
is
undeniable
that
it
forms
a
highly
agreeable
accompaniment
to
more
psychic
manifestations
and
so
as
the
lamplight
reinforced
by
accessory
candles
falls
on
the
little
table
in
the
room
looking
on
fetter
lane
only
now
the
curtains
are
drawn
the
conversation
is
not
the
less
friendly
and
bright
for
a
running
accompaniment
executed
with
knives
and
forks
for
clink
of
goblet
and
jovial
gurgle
of
on
the
contrary
to
one
of
us
at
least
to
wit
godfrey
bellingham
the
occasion
is
one
of
uncommon
festivity
and
his
boyish
enjoyment
of
the
simple
feast
makes
pathetic
suggestions
of
hard
times
faced
uncomplainingly
but
keenly
felt
nevertheless
the
talk
flitted
from
topic
to
topic
mainly
concerning
itself
with
matters
artistic
and
never
for
one
moment
approaching
the
critical
subject
of
john
bellingham
will
from
the
stepped
pyramid
of
sakkara
with
its
encaustic
tiles
to
medieval
church
floors
from
elizabethan
woodwork
to
mycenean
pottery
and
thence
to
the
industrial
arts
of
the
stone
age
and
the
civilization
of
the
aztecs
i
began
to
suspect
that
my
two
legal
friends
were
so
carried
away
by
the
interest
of
the
conversation
that
they
had
forgotten
the
secret
purpose
of
the
meeting
for
the
dessert
had
been
placed
on
the
table
by
gummer
with
the
manner
of
a
bereaved
dependent
dispensing
funeral
bakemeats
and
still
no
reference
had
been
made
to
the
case
but
it
seemed
that
thorndyke
was
but
playing
a
waiting
game
was
only
allowing
the
intimacy
to
ripen
while
he
watched
for
the
opportunity
and
that
opportunity
came
even
as
gummer
vanished
spectrally
with
a
tray
of
plates
and
glasses
so
you
had
a
visitor
last
night
doctor
said
bellingham
i
mean
my
friend
jellicoe
he
told
us
he
had
seen
you
and
mighty
curious
he
was
about
you
i
have
never
known
jellicoe
to
be
so
inquisitive
before
what
did
you
think
of
him
a
quaint
old
cock
i
found
him
highly
amusing
we
entertained
one
another
for
quite
a
long
time
with
and
crooked
answers
i
affecting
eager
curiosity
he
replying
with
a
defensive
attitude
of
universal
ignorance
it
was
a
most
diverting
encounter
he
need
have
been
so
close
miss
bellingham
remarked
seeing
that
all
the
world
will
be
regaled
with
our
affairs
before
long
they
are
proposing
to
take
the
case
into
court
then
said
thorndyke
yes
said
bellingham
jellicoe
came
to
tell
me
that
my
cousin
hurst
has
instructed
his
solicitors
to
make
the
application
and
to
invite
me
to
join
him
actually
he
came
to
deliver
an
ultimatum
from
hurst
but
i
must
disturb
the
harmony
of
this
festive
gathering
with
litigious
discords
now
why
must
you
asked
thorndyke
why
is
a
subject
in
which
we
are
all
keenly
interested
to
be
taboo
you
do
mind
telling
us
about
it
do
you
no
of
course
not
but
what
do
you
think
of
a
man
who
a
doctor
at
a
to
retail
a
list
of
ailments
it
depends
on
what
his
ailments
are
replied
thorndyke
if
he
is
a
chronic
dyspeptic
and
wishes
to
expound
the
virtues
of
doctor
snaffler
purple
pills
for
pimply
people
he
is
merely
a
bore
but
if
he
chances
to
suffer
from
some
rare
and
choice
disease
such
as
trypanosomiasis
or
acromegaly
the
doctor
will
be
delighted
to
listen
then
are
we
to
understand
miss
bellingham
asked
that
we
are
rare
and
choice
products
in
a
legal
sense
undoubtedly
replied
thorndyke
the
case
of
john
bellingham
is
in
many
respects
unique
it
will
be
followed
with
the
deepest
interest
by
the
profession
at
large
and
especially
by
medical
jurists
how
gratifying
that
should
be
to
us
said
miss
bellingham
we
may
even
attain
undying
fame
in
textbooks
and
treatises
and
yet
we
are
not
so
very
much
puffed
up
with
our
importance
no
said
her
father
we
could
do
without
the
fame
quite
well
and
so
i
think
could
hurst
did
berkeley
tell
you
of
the
proposal
that
he
made
yes
said
thorndyke
and
i
gather
from
what
you
say
that
he
has
repeated
it
yes
he
sent
jellicoe
to
give
me
another
chance
and
i
was
tempted
to
take
it
but
my
daughter
was
strongly
against
any
compromise
and
probably
she
is
right
at
any
rate
she
is
more
concerned
than
i
am
what
view
did
jellicoe
take
thorndyke
asked
oh
he
was
very
cautious
and
reserved
but
he
did
disguise
his
feeling
that
i
should
be
wise
to
take
a
certainty
in
lieu
of
a
very
problematical
fortune
he
would
certainly
like
me
to
agree
for
he
naturally
wishes
to
get
the
affair
settled
and
pocket
his
legacy
and
have
you
definitely
refused
yes
quite
definitely
so
hurst
will
apply
for
permission
to
presume
death
and
prove
the
will
and
jellicoe
will
support
him
he
says
he
has
no
choice
and
you
i
suppose
i
shall
oppose
the
application
though
i
do
quite
know
on
what
grounds
before
you
take
definite
steps
said
thorndyke
you
ought
to
give
the
matter
very
careful
consideration
i
take
it
that
you
have
very
little
doubt
that
your
brother
is
dead
and
if
he
is
dead
any
benefit
that
you
may
receive
under
the
will
must
be
conditional
on
the
previous
presumption
or
proof
of
death
but
perhaps
you
have
taken
advice
no
i
have
not
as
our
friend
the
doctor
has
probably
told
you
my
means
or
rather
the
lack
of
them
do
not
admit
of
my
getting
professional
advice
hence
my
delicacy
about
discussing
the
case
with
you
then
do
you
propose
to
conduct
your
case
in
person
yes
if
it
is
necessary
for
me
to
appear
in
court
as
i
suppose
it
will
be
if
i
oppose
the
application
thorndyke
reflected
for
a
few
moments
and
then
said
gravely
you
had
much
better
not
appear
in
person
to
conduct
your
case
bellingham
for
several
reasons
to
begin
with
hurst
is
sure
to
be
represented
by
a
capable
counsel
and
you
will
find
yourself
quite
unable
to
meet
the
sudden
exigencies
of
a
contest
in
court
you
will
be
then
there
is
the
judge
to
be
considered
but
surely
one
can
rely
on
the
judge
dealing
fairly
with
a
man
who
is
unable
to
afford
a
solicitor
and
counsel
undoubtedly
as
a
rule
a
judge
will
give
an
unrepresented
litigant
every
assistance
and
consideration
english
judges
in
general
are
men
with
a
deep
sense
of
their
great
responsibilities
but
you
can
not
afford
to
take
any
chances
you
must
consider
the
exceptions
a
judge
has
been
a
counsel
and
he
may
carry
to
the
bench
some
of
the
professional
prejudices
of
the
bar
indeed
if
you
consider
the
absurd
license
permitted
to
counsel
in
their
treatment
of
witnesses
and
the
hostile
attitude
adopted
by
some
judges
toward
medical
and
other
scientific
men
who
have
to
give
their
evidence
you
will
see
that
the
judicial
mind
is
not
always
quite
as
judicial
as
one
would
wish
especially
when
the
privileges
and
immunities
of
the
profession
are
concerned
now
your
appearance
in
person
to
conduct
your
case
must
unavoidably
cause
some
inconvenience
to
the
court
your
ignorance
of
procedure
and
legal
details
must
occasion
some
delay
and
if
the
judge
should
happen
to
be
an
irritable
man
he
might
resent
the
inconvenience
and
delay
i
do
say
that
would
affect
his
decision
i
do
think
it
would
but
i
am
sure
it
would
be
wise
to
avoid
giving
offense
to
the
judge
and
above
all
it
is
most
desirable
to
be
able
to
detect
and
reply
to
any
maneuvers
on
the
part
of
the
opposing
counsel
which
you
certainly
would
not
be
able
to
do
this
is
excellent
advice
doctor
thorndyke
said
bellingham
with
a
grim
smile
but
i
afraid
i
shall
have
to
take
my
chance
not
necessarily
said
thorndyke
i
am
going
to
make
a
little
proposal
which
i
will
ask
you
to
consider
without
prejudice
as
a
mutual
accommodation
you
see
your
case
is
one
of
exceptional
interest
it
will
become
a
textbook
case
as
miss
bellingham
prophesied
and
since
it
lies
within
my
specialty
it
will
be
necessary
for
me
to
follow
it
in
the
closest
detail
now
it
would
be
much
more
satisfactory
to
me
to
study
it
from
within
than
from
without
to
say
nothing
of
the
credit
which
would
accrue
to
me
if
i
should
be
able
to
conduct
it
to
a
successful
issue
i
am
therefore
going
to
ask
you
to
put
your
case
in
my
hands
and
let
me
see
what
can
be
done
with
it
i
know
this
is
an
unusual
course
for
a
professional
man
to
take
but
i
think
it
is
not
improper
under
the
circumstances
bellingham
pondered
in
silence
for
a
few
moments
and
then
after
a
glance
at
his
daughter
began
rather
hesitatingly
it
very
generous
of
you
doctor
thorndyke
pardon
me
interrupted
thorndyke
it
is
not
my
motives
as
i
have
explained
are
purely
egoistic
bellingham
laughed
uneasily
and
again
glanced
at
his
daughter
who
however
pursued
her
occupation
of
peeling
a
pear
with
calm
deliberation
and
without
lifting
her
eyes
getting
no
help
from
her
he
asked
do
you
think
that
there
is
any
possibility
whatever
of
a
successful
issue
yes
a
remote
possibility
very
remote
i
fear
as
things
look
at
present
but
if
i
thought
the
case
absolutely
hopeless
i
should
advise
you
to
stand
aside
and
let
events
take
their
course
supposing
the
case
should
come
to
a
favorable
termination
would
you
allow
me
to
settle
your
fees
in
the
ordinary
way
if
the
choice
lay
with
me
replied
thorndyke
i
should
say
with
pleasure
but
it
does
not
the
attitude
of
the
profession
is
very
definitely
unfavorable
to
practise
you
may
remember
the
firm
of
dodson
and
fogg
who
gained
thereby
much
profit
but
little
credit
but
why
discuss
contingencies
of
this
kind
if
i
bring
your
case
to
a
successful
issue
i
shall
have
done
very
well
for
myself
we
shall
have
benefited
one
another
mutually
come
now
miss
bellingham
i
appeal
to
you
we
have
eaten
salt
together
to
say
nothing
of
pigeon
pie
and
other
cakes
wo
you
back
me
up
and
at
the
same
time
do
a
kindness
to
doctor
berkeley
why
is
doctor
berkeley
interested
in
our
decision
certainly
he
is
as
you
will
appreciate
when
i
tell
you
that
he
actually
tried
to
bribe
me
secretly
out
of
his
own
pocket
did
you
she
asked
looking
at
me
with
an
expression
that
rather
alarmed
me
well
not
exactly
i
replied
mighty
hot
and
uncomfortable
and
wishing
thorndyke
at
the
devil
with
his
confidences
i
merely
mentioned
that
the
the
solicitor
costs
you
know
and
that
sort
of
thing
but
you
need
jump
on
me
miss
bellingham
doctor
thorndyke
did
all
that
was
necessary
in
that
way
she
continued
to
look
at
me
thoughtfully
as
i
stammered
out
my
excuses
and
then
said
i
was
going
to
i
was
only
thinking
that
poverty
has
its
compensations
you
are
all
so
very
good
to
us
and
for
my
part
i
should
accept
doctor
thorndyke
generous
offer
most
gratefully
and
thank
him
for
making
it
so
easy
for
us
very
well
my
dear
said
bellingham
we
will
enjoy
the
sweets
of
poverty
as
you
say
we
have
sampled
the
other
kind
of
thing
pretty
freely
and
do
ourselves
the
pleasure
of
accepting
a
great
kindness
most
delicately
offered
thank
you
said
thorndyke
you
have
justified
my
faith
in
you
miss
bellingham
and
in
the
power
of
berkeley
salt
i
understand
that
you
place
your
affairs
in
my
hands
entirely
and
thankfully
replied
bellingham
whatever
you
think
best
to
be
done
we
agree
to
beforehand
then
said
i
let
us
drink
success
to
the
cause
port
if
you
please
miss
bellingham
the
vintage
is
not
recorded
but
it
is
quite
wholesome
and
a
suitable
medium
for
the
sodium
chloride
of
friendship
i
filled
her
glass
and
when
the
bottle
had
made
its
circuit
we
stood
up
and
solemnly
pledged
the
new
alliance
there
is
just
one
thing
i
would
say
before
we
dismiss
the
subject
for
the
present
said
thorndyke
it
is
a
good
thing
to
keep
one
own
counsel
when
you
get
formal
notice
from
hurst
solicitors
that
proceedings
are
being
commenced
you
may
refer
them
to
marchmont
of
gray
inn
who
will
nominally
act
for
you
he
will
actually
have
nothing
to
do
but
we
must
preserve
the
fiction
that
i
am
instructed
by
a
solicitor
meanwhile
and
until
the
case
goes
into
court
i
think
it
very
necessary
that
neither
jellicoe
nor
anyone
else
should
know
that
i
am
connected
with
it
we
must
keep
the
other
side
in
the
dark
if
we
can
we
will
be
as
secret
as
the
grave
said
bellingham
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
will
be
quite
easy
since
it
happens
by
a
curious
coincidence
that
i
am
already
acquainted
with
marchmont
he
acted
for
stephen
blackmore
you
remember
in
that
case
that
you
unraveled
so
wonderfully
i
knew
the
blackmores
did
you
said
thorndyke
what
a
small
world
it
is
and
what
a
remarkable
affair
that
was
the
intricacies
and
made
it
quite
absorbingly
interesting
and
it
is
noteworthy
for
me
in
another
respect
for
it
was
one
of
the
first
cases
in
which
i
was
associated
with
doctor
jervis
yes
and
a
mighty
useful
associate
i
was
remarked
jervis
though
i
did
pick
up
one
or
two
facts
by
accident
and
by
the
way
the
blackmore
case
had
certain
points
in
common
with
your
case
bellingham
there
was
a
disappearance
and
a
disputed
will
and
the
man
who
vanished
was
a
scholar
and
an
antiquarian
cases
in
our
specialty
are
apt
to
have
certain
general
resemblances
thorndyke
said
and
as
he
spoke
he
directed
a
keen
glance
at
his
junior
the
significance
of
which
i
partly
understood
when
he
abruptly
changed
the
subject
the
newspaper
reports
of
your
brother
disappearance
bellingham
were
remarkably
full
of
detail
there
were
even
plans
of
your
house
and
that
of
hurst
do
you
know
who
supplied
the
information
no
i
do
replied
bellingham
i
know
that
i
did
some
newspaper
men
came
to
me
for
information
but
i
sent
them
packing
so
i
understand
did
hurst
and
as
for
jellicoe
you
might
as
well
an
oyster
well
said
thorndyke
the
pressmen
have
queer
methods
of
getting
but
still
some
one
must
have
given
them
that
description
of
your
brother
and
those
plans
it
would
be
interesting
to
know
who
it
was
however
we
do
know
and
now
let
us
dismiss
these
legal
topics
with
suitable
apologies
for
having
introduced
them
and
perhaps
said
i
we
may
as
well
adjourn
to
what
we
call
the
it
is
really
barnard
den
and
leave
the
housekeeper
to
wrestle
with
the
debris
we
migrated
to
the
cheerfully
shabby
little
apartment
and
when
gummer
had
served
coffee
with
gloomy
resignation
as
who
should
say
if
you
will
drink
this
sort
of
stuff
i
suppose
you
must
but
blame
me
for
the
consequences
i
settled
bellingham
in
favorite
easy
chair
the
depressed
seat
of
which
suggested
its
customary
use
by
an
elephant
of
sedentary
habits
and
opened
the
diminutive
piano
i
wonder
if
miss
bellingham
would
give
us
a
little
music
i
said
i
wonder
if
she
could
was
the
smiling
response
do
you
know
she
continued
i
have
not
touched
a
piano
for
nearly
two
years
it
will
be
quite
an
interesting
experiment
to
me
but
if
it
fails
you
will
be
the
sufferers
so
you
must
choose
my
verdict
said
bellingham
is
though
i
wo
complete
the
quotation
as
that
would
seem
to
disparage
doctor
barnard
piano
but
before
you
begin
ruth
there
is
one
rather
disagreeable
matter
that
i
want
to
dispose
of
so
that
i
may
not
disturb
the
harmony
with
it
later
he
paused
and
we
all
looked
at
him
expectantly
i
suppose
doctor
thorndyke
he
said
you
read
the
newspapers
i
do
replied
thorndyke
but
i
ascertain
for
purely
business
purposes
what
they
contain
then
said
bellingham
you
have
probably
met
with
some
accounts
of
the
finding
of
certain
human
remains
apparently
portions
of
a
mutilated
body
yes
i
have
seen
those
reports
and
filed
them
for
future
reference
exactly
well
now
it
can
hardly
be
necessary
for
me
to
tell
you
that
those
remains
the
mutilated
remains
of
some
poor
murdered
creature
as
there
can
be
no
doubt
they
are
have
seemed
to
have
a
very
dreadful
significance
for
me
you
will
understand
what
i
mean
and
i
want
to
ask
you
if
if
they
have
made
a
similar
suggestion
to
you
thorndyke
paused
before
replying
with
his
eyes
bent
thoughtfully
on
the
floor
and
we
all
looked
at
him
anxiously
it
very
natural
he
said
at
length
that
you
should
associate
these
remains
with
the
mystery
of
your
brother
disappearance
i
should
like
to
say
that
you
are
wrong
in
doing
so
but
if
i
did
i
should
be
uncandid
there
are
certain
facts
that
do
undoubtedly
seem
to
suggest
a
connection
and
up
to
the
present
there
are
no
definite
facts
of
a
contrary
significance
bellingham
sighed
deeply
and
shifted
uncomfortably
in
his
chair
it
is
a
horrible
affair
he
said
huskily
horrible
would
you
mind
doctor
thorndyke
telling
us
just
how
the
matter
stands
in
your
opinion
what
the
probabilities
are
for
and
against
again
thorndyke
reflected
awhile
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
was
not
very
willing
to
discuss
the
subject
however
the
question
had
been
asked
pointedly
and
eventually
he
answered
at
the
present
stage
of
the
investigation
it
is
not
very
easy
to
state
the
balance
of
probabilities
the
matter
is
still
quite
speculative
the
bones
which
have
been
found
hitherto
for
we
are
dealing
with
a
skeleton
not
with
a
body
have
been
exclusively
those
which
are
useless
for
personal
identification
which
is
in
itself
a
rather
curious
and
striking
fact
the
general
character
and
dimensions
of
the
bones
seem
to
suggest
a
man
of
about
your
brother
height
and
the
date
of
deposition
appears
to
be
in
agreement
with
the
date
of
his
disappearance
is
it
known
then
when
they
were
deposited
asked
bellingham
in
the
case
of
those
found
at
sidcup
it
seems
possible
to
deduce
an
approximate
date
the
was
cleaned
out
about
two
years
ago
so
they
could
not
have
been
lying
there
longer
than
that
and
their
condition
suggests
that
they
could
not
have
been
there
much
less
than
two
years
as
there
is
apparently
no
vestige
of
the
soft
structures
left
of
course
i
am
speaking
from
the
newspaper
reports
only
i
have
no
direct
knowledge
of
the
matter
have
they
found
any
considerable
part
of
the
body
yet
i
have
been
reading
the
papers
myself
my
little
friend
miss
oman
brought
a
great
bundle
of
for
me
to
read
but
i
could
stand
it
i
pitched
the
whole
boiling
of
out
of
the
window
i
thought
i
detected
a
slight
twinkle
in
thorndyke
eye
but
he
answered
quite
gravely
i
think
i
can
give
you
the
particulars
from
memory
though
i
guarantee
the
dates
the
original
discovery
was
made
apparently
quite
accidentally
at
sidcup
on
the
fifteenth
of
july
it
consisted
of
a
complete
left
arm
minus
the
third
finger
and
including
the
bones
of
the
shoulder
the
and
this
discovery
seems
to
have
set
the
local
population
especially
the
juvenile
part
of
it
searching
all
the
ponds
and
streams
of
the
neighborhood
cannibals
interjected
bellingham
with
the
result
that
there
was
dredged
up
out
of
a
pond
near
mary
cray
in
kent
a
right
there
is
a
slight
clue
to
identity
in
respect
of
this
bone
since
the
head
of
it
has
a
small
patch
of
that
is
a
sort
of
polish
that
occurs
on
the
parts
of
bones
that
form
a
joint
when
the
natural
covering
of
cartilage
is
destroyed
by
disease
it
is
produced
by
the
unprotected
surface
of
the
bone
grinding
against
the
similarly
unprotected
surface
of
another
and
how
bellingham
asked
would
that
help
the
identification
it
would
indicate
thorndyke
replied
that
the
deceased
had
probably
suffered
from
rheumatoid
arthritis
what
is
commonly
known
as
rheumatic
gout
and
he
would
probably
have
limped
slightly
and
complained
of
some
pain
in
the
right
hip
i
afraid
that
does
help
us
very
much
said
bellingham
for
you
see
john
had
a
pretty
pronounced
limp
from
another
cause
an
old
injury
to
his
left
ankle
and
as
to
complaining
of
pain
well
he
was
a
hardy
old
fellow
and
not
much
given
to
making
complaints
of
any
kind
but
do
let
me
interrupt
you
the
next
discovery
continued
thorndyke
was
made
near
lee
by
the
police
this
time
they
seem
to
have
developed
sudden
activity
in
the
matter
and
in
searching
the
neighborhood
of
west
kent
they
dragged
out
of
a
pond
near
lee
the
bones
of
a
right
foot
now
if
it
had
been
the
left
instead
of
the
right
we
might
have
a
clue
as
i
understand
your
brother
had
fractured
his
left
ankle
and
there
might
have
been
some
traces
of
the
injury
on
the
foot
itself
yes
said
bellingham
i
suppose
there
might
the
injury
was
described
as
a
pott
fracture
exactly
well
now
after
this
discovery
at
lee
it
seems
that
the
police
set
on
foot
a
systematic
search
of
all
the
ponds
and
small
pieces
of
water
around
london
and
on
the
they
found
in
the
cuckoo
pits
in
epping
forest
not
far
from
woodford
the
bones
of
a
right
arm
including
those
of
the
shoulder
as
before
which
seem
to
be
part
of
the
same
body
yes
said
bellingham
i
heard
of
that
quite
close
to
my
old
house
horrible
horrible
it
gave
me
the
shudders
to
think
of
it
to
think
that
poor
old
john
may
have
been
waylaid
and
murdered
when
he
was
actually
coming
to
see
me
he
may
even
have
got
into
the
grounds
by
the
back
gate
if
it
was
left
unfastened
and
been
followed
in
there
and
murdered
you
remember
that
a
scarab
from
his
was
found
there
but
is
it
clear
that
this
arm
was
the
fellow
of
the
arm
that
was
found
at
sidcup
it
seems
to
agree
in
character
and
dimensions
said
thorndyke
and
the
agreement
is
strongly
supported
by
a
discovery
made
two
days
later
what
is
that
bellingham
demanded
it
is
the
lower
half
of
a
trunk
which
the
police
dragged
out
of
a
rather
deep
pond
on
the
skirts
of
the
forest
at
loughton
pond
it
is
called
the
bones
found
were
the
pelvis
that
is
the
two
and
six
vertebrae
or
joints
of
the
backbone
having
discovered
these
the
police
dammed
the
stream
and
pumped
the
pond
dry
but
no
other
bones
were
found
which
is
rather
odd
as
there
should
have
been
a
pair
of
ribs
belonging
to
the
upper
vertebra
the
twelfth
dorsal
vertebra
it
suggests
some
curious
questions
as
to
the
method
of
dismemberment
but
i
must
go
into
unpleasant
details
the
point
is
that
the
cavity
of
the
right
showed
a
patch
of
eburnation
corresponding
to
that
on
the
head
of
the
right
that
was
found
at
mary
cray
so
there
can
be
very
little
doubt
that
these
bones
are
all
part
of
the
same
body
i
see
grunted
bellingham
and
he
added
after
a
thought
now
the
question
is
are
these
bones
the
remains
of
my
brother
john
what
do
you
say
doctor
thorndyke
i
say
that
the
question
can
not
be
answered
on
the
facts
at
present
known
to
us
it
can
only
be
said
that
they
may
be
and
that
some
of
the
circumstances
suggest
that
they
are
but
we
can
only
wait
for
further
discoveries
at
any
moment
the
police
may
light
upon
some
portion
of
the
skeleton
which
will
settle
the
question
definitely
one
way
or
the
other
i
suppose
said
bellingham
i
ca
be
of
any
service
to
you
in
the
matter
of
identification
indeed
you
can
said
thorndyke
and
i
was
going
to
ask
you
to
assist
me
what
i
want
you
to
do
is
this
write
down
a
full
description
of
your
brother
including
every
detail
known
to
you
together
with
an
account
of
every
illness
or
injury
from
which
you
know
him
to
have
suffered
also
the
names
and
if
possible
the
addresses
of
any
doctors
surgeons
or
dentists
who
may
have
attended
him
at
any
time
the
dentists
are
particularly
important
as
their
information
would
be
invaluable
if
the
skull
belonging
to
these
bones
should
be
discovered
bellingham
shuddered
it
a
shocking
idea
he
said
but
of
course
you
are
right
you
must
have
the
facts
if
you
are
to
form
an
opinion
i
will
write
out
what
you
want
and
send
it
to
you
without
delay
and
now
for
sake
let
us
throw
off
this
nightmare
for
a
little
while
at
least
what
is
there
ruth
among
doctor
barnard
music
that
you
can
manage
barnard
collection
in
general
inclined
to
the
severely
classical
but
we
disinterred
from
the
heap
a
few
lighter
works
of
an
kind
including
a
volume
of
mendelssohn
ohne
and
with
one
of
these
miss
bellingham
made
trial
of
her
skill
playing
it
with
excellent
taste
and
quite
adequate
execution
that
at
least
was
her
father
verdict
for
as
to
me
i
found
it
the
perfection
of
happiness
merely
to
sit
and
look
at
her
a
state
of
mind
that
would
have
been
in
no
wise
disturbed
even
by
silvery
waves
or
the
maiden
prayer
thus
with
simple
homely
music
and
conversation
always
cheerful
and
sometimes
brilliant
slipped
away
one
of
the
pleasantest
evenings
of
my
life
and
slipped
away
all
too
soon
dunstan
clock
was
the
fly
in
the
ointment
for
it
boomed
out
intrusively
the
hour
of
eleven
just
as
my
guests
were
beginning
thoroughly
to
appreciate
one
another
and
thereby
carried
the
sun
with
a
minor
paternal
satellite
out
of
the
firmament
of
my
heaven
for
i
had
in
my
professional
capacity
given
strict
injunctions
that
bellingham
should
on
no
account
sit
up
late
and
now
in
my
social
capacity
i
had
smilingly
to
hear
the
doctor
orders
quoted
it
was
a
scurvy
return
for
all
my
care
when
and
miss
bellingham
departed
thorndyke
and
jervis
would
have
gone
too
but
noting
my
bereaved
condition
and
being
withal
compassionate
and
tender
of
heart
they
were
persuaded
to
stay
awhile
and
bear
me
company
in
a
consolatory
pipe
chapter
xi
the
evidence
reviewed
so
the
game
has
opened
observed
thorndyke
as
he
struck
a
match
the
play
has
begun
with
a
cautious
lead
off
by
the
other
side
very
cautious
and
not
very
confident
why
do
you
say
very
confident
i
asked
well
it
is
evident
that
hurst
and
i
fancy
jellicoe
too
is
anxious
to
buy
off
bellingham
opposition
and
at
a
pretty
long
price
under
the
circumstances
and
when
we
consider
how
very
little
bellingham
has
to
offer
against
the
presumption
of
his
brother
death
it
looks
as
if
hurst
had
much
to
say
on
his
side
no
said
jervis
he
ca
hold
many
trumps
or
he
would
be
willing
to
pay
four
hundred
a
year
for
his
opponent
chance
and
that
is
just
as
well
for
it
seems
to
me
that
our
own
hand
is
a
pretty
poor
one
we
must
look
through
our
hand
and
see
what
we
do
hold
said
thorndyke
our
trump
card
at
present
a
rather
small
one
afraid
is
the
obvious
intention
of
the
testator
that
the
bulk
of
the
property
should
go
to
his
brother
i
suppose
you
will
begin
your
inquiries
now
i
said
we
began
them
some
time
ago
the
day
after
you
brought
us
the
will
in
fact
jervis
has
been
through
the
registers
and
has
ascertained
that
no
interment
under
the
name
of
john
bellingham
has
taken
place
since
the
disappearance
which
was
just
what
we
expected
he
has
also
discovered
that
some
other
person
has
been
making
similar
inquiries
which
again
is
what
we
expected
and
your
own
investigations
have
given
negative
results
for
the
most
part
i
found
doctor
norbury
at
the
british
museum
very
friendly
and
helpful
so
friendly
in
fact
that
i
am
thinking
whether
i
may
not
be
able
to
enlist
his
help
in
certain
private
researches
of
my
own
with
reference
to
the
change
effected
by
time
in
the
physical
properties
of
certain
substances
oh
you
have
told
me
about
that
said
jervis
no
i
have
really
commenced
to
plan
my
experiments
yet
and
they
will
probably
lead
to
nothing
when
i
do
it
occurred
to
me
that
possibly
in
the
course
of
time
certain
molecular
changes
might
take
place
in
substances
such
as
wood
bone
pottery
stucco
and
other
common
materials
and
that
these
changes
might
alter
their
power
of
conducting
or
transmitting
molecular
vibrations
now
if
this
should
turn
out
to
be
the
case
it
would
be
a
fact
of
considerable
importance
and
otherwise
for
it
would
be
possible
to
determine
approximately
the
age
of
any
object
of
known
composition
by
testing
its
reactions
to
electricity
heat
light
and
other
molecular
vibrations
i
thought
of
seeking
doctor
norbury
assistance
because
he
can
furnish
me
with
materials
for
experiment
of
such
great
age
that
the
reactions
if
any
should
be
extremely
easy
to
demonstrate
but
to
return
to
our
case
i
learned
from
him
that
john
bellingham
had
certain
friends
in
paris
collectors
and
museum
officials
whom
he
was
in
the
habit
of
visiting
for
the
purpose
of
study
and
exchange
of
specimens
i
have
made
inquiries
of
all
these
and
none
of
them
had
seen
him
during
his
last
visit
in
fact
i
have
not
yet
discovered
anyone
who
had
seen
bellingham
in
paris
on
this
occasion
so
his
visit
there
remains
a
mystery
for
the
present
it
does
seem
to
be
of
much
importance
since
he
undoubtedly
came
back
i
remarked
but
to
this
thorndyke
demurred
it
is
impossible
to
estimate
the
importance
of
the
unknown
said
he
well
how
does
the
matter
stand
asked
jervis
on
the
evidence
that
we
have
john
bellingham
disappeared
on
a
certain
date
is
there
anything
to
show
what
was
the
manner
of
his
disappearance
the
facts
in
our
possession
said
thorndyke
which
are
mainly
those
set
forth
in
the
newspaper
report
suggest
several
alternative
possibilities
and
in
view
of
the
coming
inquiry
for
they
will
no
doubt
have
to
be
gone
into
in
court
to
some
extent
it
may
be
worth
while
to
consider
them
there
are
five
conceivable
hypotheses
here
thorndyke
checked
them
on
his
fingers
as
he
proceeded
first
he
may
still
be
alive
second
he
may
have
died
and
been
buried
without
identification
third
he
may
have
been
murdered
by
some
unknown
person
fourth
he
may
have
been
murdered
by
hurst
and
his
body
concealed
fifth
he
may
have
been
murdered
by
his
brother
let
us
examine
these
possibilities
seriatim
first
he
may
still
be
alive
if
he
is
he
must
either
have
disappeared
voluntarily
have
lost
his
memory
suddenly
and
not
been
identified
or
have
been
imprisoned
on
a
false
charge
or
otherwise
let
us
take
the
first
case
that
of
voluntary
disappearance
obviously
its
improbability
is
extreme
jellicoe
does
think
so
said
i
he
thinks
it
quite
on
the
cards
that
john
bellingham
is
alive
he
says
that
it
is
not
a
very
unusual
thing
for
a
man
to
disappear
for
a
time
then
why
is
he
applying
for
a
presumption
of
death
just
what
i
asked
him
he
says
that
it
is
the
correct
thing
to
do
that
the
entire
responsibility
rests
on
the
court
that
is
all
nonsense
said
thorndyke
jellicoe
is
the
trustee
for
his
absent
client
and
if
he
thinks
that
client
is
alive
it
is
his
duty
to
keep
the
estate
intact
and
he
knows
that
perfectly
well
we
may
take
it
that
jellicoe
is
of
the
same
opinion
as
i
am
that
john
bellingham
is
dead
still
i
urged
men
do
disappear
from
time
to
time
and
turn
up
again
after
years
of
absence
yes
but
for
a
definite
reason
either
they
are
irresponsible
vagabounds
who
take
this
way
of
shuffling
off
their
responsibilities
or
they
are
men
who
have
been
caught
in
a
net
of
distasteful
circumstances
for
instance
a
civil
servant
or
a
solicitor
or
a
tradesman
finds
himself
bound
for
life
to
a
locality
and
an
occupation
of
intolerable
monotony
perhaps
he
has
an
wife
who
after
the
amiable
fashion
of
a
certain
type
of
woman
thinking
that
her
husband
is
pinned
down
without
a
chance
of
escape
gives
a
free
rein
to
her
temper
the
man
puts
up
with
it
for
years
but
at
last
it
becomes
unbearable
then
he
suddenly
disappears
and
small
blame
to
him
but
this
was
not
bellingham
case
he
was
a
wealthy
bachelor
with
an
engrossing
interest
in
life
free
to
go
whither
he
would
and
to
do
whatsoever
he
wished
why
should
he
disappear
the
thing
is
incredible
as
to
his
having
lost
his
memory
and
remained
unidentified
that
also
is
incredible
in
the
case
of
a
man
who
had
and
letters
in
his
pocket
whose
linen
was
marked
and
who
was
being
inquired
for
everywhere
by
the
police
as
to
his
being
in
prison
we
may
dismiss
that
possibility
inasmuch
as
a
prisoner
both
before
and
after
conviction
would
have
full
opportunity
of
communicating
with
his
friends
the
second
possibility
that
he
may
have
died
suddenly
and
been
buried
without
identification
is
highly
improbable
but
as
it
is
conceivable
that
the
body
might
have
been
robbed
and
the
means
of
identification
thus
lost
it
remains
as
a
possibility
that
has
to
be
considered
remote
as
it
is
the
third
hypothesis
that
he
may
have
been
murdered
by
some
unknown
person
is
under
the
circumstances
not
wildly
improbable
but
as
the
police
were
on
the
lookout
and
a
detailed
description
of
the
missing
man
person
was
published
in
the
papers
it
would
involve
the
complete
concealment
of
the
body
but
this
would
exclude
the
most
probable
form
of
crime
the
casual
robbery
with
violence
it
is
therefore
possible
but
highly
improbable
the
fourth
hypothesis
is
that
bellingham
was
murdered
by
hurst
now
the
one
fact
which
militates
against
this
view
is
that
hurst
apparently
had
no
motive
for
committing
the
murder
we
are
assured
by
jellicoe
that
no
one
but
himself
knew
the
contents
of
the
will
and
if
this
is
so
but
mind
we
have
no
evidence
that
it
is
so
hurst
would
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
he
had
anything
material
to
gain
by
his
death
otherwise
the
hypothesis
presents
no
inherent
improbabilities
the
man
was
last
seen
alive
at
hurst
house
he
was
seen
to
enter
it
and
he
was
never
seen
to
leave
it
we
are
still
taking
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
newspapers
remember
and
it
now
appears
that
he
stands
to
benefit
enormously
by
that
man
death
but
i
objected
you
are
forgetting
that
directly
the
man
was
missed
hurst
and
the
servants
together
searched
the
entire
house
yes
what
did
they
search
for
why
for
bellingham
of
course
exactly
for
bellingham
that
is
for
a
living
man
now
how
do
you
search
a
house
for
a
living
man
you
look
in
all
the
rooms
when
you
look
in
a
room
if
he
is
there
you
see
him
if
you
do
not
see
him
you
assume
that
he
is
not
there
you
do
look
under
the
sofa
or
behind
the
piano
you
do
pull
out
large
drawers
or
open
cupboards
you
just
look
into
the
rooms
that
is
what
these
people
seem
to
have
done
and
they
did
not
see
bellingham
bellingham
corpse
might
have
been
stowed
away
out
of
sight
in
any
one
of
the
rooms
that
they
looked
into
that
is
a
grim
thought
said
jervis
but
it
is
perfectly
true
there
is
no
evidence
that
the
man
was
not
lying
dead
in
the
house
at
the
very
time
of
the
search
but
even
so
said
i
there
was
the
body
to
be
disposed
of
somehow
now
how
could
he
possibly
have
got
rid
of
the
body
without
being
observed
ah
said
thorndyke
now
we
are
touching
on
a
point
of
crucial
importance
if
anyone
should
ever
write
a
treatise
on
the
art
of
murder
not
an
exhibition
of
literary
fireworks
like
de
quincey
but
a
genuine
working
treatise
he
might
leave
all
other
technical
details
to
take
care
of
themselves
if
he
could
describe
some
really
practicable
plan
for
disposing
of
the
body
that
is
and
always
has
been
the
great
to
the
murderer
to
get
rid
of
the
body
the
human
body
he
continued
thoughtfully
regarding
his
pipe
just
as
in
the
days
of
my
pupilage
he
was
wont
to
regard
the
chalk
is
a
very
remarkable
object
it
presents
a
combination
of
properties
that
make
it
singularly
difficult
to
conceal
permanently
it
is
bulky
and
of
an
awkward
shape
it
is
heavy
it
is
completely
incombustible
it
is
chemically
unstable
and
its
decomposition
yields
great
volumes
of
highly
odorous
gases
and
it
nevertheless
contains
identifiable
structures
of
the
highest
degree
of
permanence
it
is
extremely
difficult
to
preserve
unchanged
and
it
is
still
more
difficult
completely
to
destroy
the
essential
permanence
of
the
human
body
is
well
shown
in
the
classical
case
of
eugene
aram
but
a
still
more
striking
instance
is
that
of
the
third
one
of
the
last
kings
of
the
seventeenth
egyptian
dynasty
here
after
a
lapse
of
four
thousand
years
it
has
been
possible
to
determine
not
only
the
cause
of
death
and
the
manner
of
its
occurrence
but
the
way
in
which
the
king
fell
the
nature
of
the
weapon
with
which
the
fatal
wound
was
inflicted
and
even
the
position
of
the
assailant
and
the
permanence
of
the
body
under
other
conditions
is
admirably
shown
in
the
case
of
doctor
parkman
of
boston
in
which
identification
was
actually
effected
by
means
of
remains
collected
from
the
ashes
of
a
furnace
then
we
may
take
it
said
jervis
that
the
world
has
not
yet
seen
the
last
of
john
bellingham
i
think
we
may
regard
that
as
almost
a
certainty
replied
thorndyke
the
only
question
and
a
very
important
one
is
as
to
when
the
reappearance
may
take
place
it
may
be
or
it
may
be
centuries
hence
when
all
the
issues
involved
have
been
forgotten
assuming
said
i
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
hurst
did
murder
him
and
that
the
body
was
concealed
in
the
study
at
the
time
the
search
was
made
how
could
it
have
been
disposed
of
if
you
had
been
in
hurst
place
how
would
you
have
gone
to
work
thorndyke
smiled
at
the
bluntness
of
my
question
you
are
asking
me
for
an
incriminating
statement
said
he
delivered
in
the
presence
of
a
witness
too
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
is
no
use
in
speculating
we
should
have
to
reconstruct
a
purely
imaginary
situation
the
circumstances
of
which
are
unknown
to
us
and
we
should
almost
certainly
reconstruct
it
wrong
what
we
may
fairly
assume
is
that
no
reasonable
person
no
matter
how
immoral
would
find
himself
in
the
position
that
you
suggest
murder
is
usually
a
crime
of
impulse
and
the
murderer
a
person
of
feeble
such
persons
are
most
unlikely
to
make
elaborate
and
ingenious
arrangements
for
the
disposal
of
the
bodies
of
their
victims
even
the
perpetrators
of
the
most
carefully
planned
murders
appear
as
i
have
said
to
break
down
at
this
point
the
almost
insuperable
difficulty
of
getting
rid
of
the
human
body
is
not
appreciated
until
the
murderer
suddenly
finds
himself
face
to
face
with
it
in
the
case
you
are
suggesting
the
choice
would
seem
to
lie
between
burial
on
the
premises
or
dismemberment
and
dispersal
of
the
fragments
and
either
method
would
be
pretty
certain
to
lead
to
discovery
as
illustrated
by
the
remains
of
which
you
were
speaking
to
bellingham
jervis
remarked
exactly
thorndyke
answered
though
we
could
hardly
imagine
a
reasonably
intelligent
criminal
adopting
a
as
a
hiding
place
no
that
was
certainly
an
error
of
judgment
by
the
way
i
thought
it
best
to
say
nothing
while
you
were
talking
to
bellingham
but
i
noticed
that
in
discussing
the
possibility
of
those
being
the
bones
of
his
brother
you
made
no
comment
on
the
absence
of
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
i
am
sure
you
did
overlook
it
but
is
it
a
point
of
some
importance
as
to
identification
under
the
present
circumstances
i
think
not
if
there
were
a
man
missing
who
had
lost
that
finger
it
would
of
course
be
an
important
fact
but
i
have
not
heard
of
any
such
man
or
again
if
there
were
any
evidence
that
the
finger
had
been
removed
before
death
it
would
be
highly
important
but
there
is
no
such
evidence
it
may
have
been
cut
off
after
death
and
that
is
where
the
real
significance
of
its
absence
lies
i
do
see
quite
what
you
mean
said
jervis
i
mean
that
if
there
is
no
report
of
any
missing
man
who
had
lost
that
particular
finger
the
probability
is
that
the
finger
was
removed
after
death
and
then
arises
the
interesting
question
of
motive
why
should
it
have
been
removed
it
could
hardly
have
become
detached
accidentally
what
do
you
suggest
well
said
jervis
it
might
have
been
a
peculiar
finger
a
finger
for
instance
with
some
characteristic
deformity
such
as
an
ankylosed
joint
which
would
be
easy
to
identify
yes
but
that
explanation
introduces
the
same
difficulty
no
person
with
a
deformed
or
ankylosed
finger
has
been
reported
as
missing
jervis
puckered
up
his
brows
and
looked
at
me
i
hanged
if
i
see
any
other
explanation
he
said
do
you
berkeley
i
shook
my
head
do
forget
which
finger
it
is
that
is
missing
said
thorndyke
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
oh
i
see
said
jervis
the
you
mean
that
it
may
have
been
removed
for
the
sake
of
a
ring
that
would
come
off
yes
it
would
not
be
the
first
instance
of
the
kind
fingers
have
been
severed
from
dead
hands
and
even
from
living
ones
for
the
sake
of
rings
that
were
too
tight
to
be
drawn
off
and
the
fact
that
it
is
the
left
hand
supports
the
suggestion
for
a
ring
that
was
inconveniently
tight
would
be
worn
by
preference
on
the
left
hand
as
that
is
usually
slightly
smaller
than
the
right
what
is
the
matter
berkeley
a
sudden
light
had
burst
upon
me
and
i
suppose
my
countenance
betrayed
the
fact
i
am
a
confounded
fool
i
exclaimed
oh
do
say
that
said
jervis
give
your
friends
a
chance
i
ought
to
have
seen
this
long
ago
and
told
you
about
it
john
bellingham
did
wear
a
ring
and
it
was
so
tight
that
when
once
he
had
got
it
on
he
could
never
get
it
off
again
do
you
happen
to
know
on
which
hand
he
wore
it
thorndyke
asked
yes
it
was
on
the
left
hand
because
miss
bellingham
who
told
me
about
it
said
that
he
would
never
have
been
able
to
get
the
ring
on
at
all
but
for
the
fact
that
his
left
hand
was
slightly
smaller
than
his
right
there
it
is
then
said
thorndyke
with
this
new
fact
in
our
possession
the
absence
of
the
finger
furnishes
the
of
some
very
curious
speculations
as
for
instance
said
jervis
ah
under
the
circumstances
i
must
leave
you
to
pursue
those
speculations
independently
i
am
now
acting
for
mr
bellingham
jervis
grinned
and
was
silent
for
refilling
his
pipe
thoughtfully
but
when
he
had
got
it
alight
he
resumed
to
return
to
the
question
of
the
disappearance
you
do
consider
it
highly
improbable
that
bellingham
might
have
been
murdered
by
hurst
oh
do
imagine
i
am
making
an
accusation
i
am
considering
the
various
probabilities
merely
in
the
abstract
the
same
reasoning
applies
to
the
bellinghams
as
to
whether
any
of
them
did
commit
the
murder
that
is
a
question
of
personal
character
i
certainly
do
not
suspect
the
bellinghams
after
having
seen
them
and
with
regard
to
hurst
i
know
nothing
or
at
least
very
little
to
his
disadvantage
do
you
know
anything
asked
jervis
well
thorndyke
said
with
some
hesitation
it
seems
a
thought
unkind
to
rake
up
the
little
details
of
a
man
past
and
yet
it
has
to
be
done
i
have
of
course
made
the
usual
routine
inquiries
concerning
the
parties
to
this
affair
and
this
is
what
they
have
brought
to
light
hurst
as
you
know
is
a
stockbroker
a
man
of
good
position
and
reputation
but
about
ten
years
ago
he
seems
to
have
committed
an
indiscretion
to
put
it
mildly
which
nearly
got
him
into
rather
serious
difficulties
he
appears
to
have
speculated
rather
heavily
and
considerably
beyond
his
means
for
when
a
sudden
spasm
of
the
markets
upset
his
calculations
it
turned
out
that
he
had
been
employing
his
clients
capital
and
securities
for
a
time
it
looked
as
if
there
was
going
to
be
serious
trouble
then
quite
unexpectedly
he
managed
to
raise
the
necessary
amount
in
some
way
and
settle
all
claims
whence
he
got
the
money
has
never
been
discovered
to
this
day
which
is
a
curious
circumstance
seeing
that
the
deficiency
was
rather
over
five
thousand
pounds
but
the
important
fact
is
that
he
did
get
it
and
that
he
paid
up
all
that
he
owed
so
that
he
was
only
a
potential
defaulter
so
to
speak
and
discreditable
as
the
affair
undoubtedly
was
it
does
not
seem
to
have
any
direct
bearing
on
this
present
case
no
jervis
agreed
though
it
makes
one
consider
his
position
with
more
attention
than
one
would
otherwise
undoubtedly
said
thorndyke
a
reckless
gambler
is
a
man
whose
conduct
can
not
be
relied
on
he
is
subject
to
vicissitudes
of
fortune
which
may
force
him
into
other
kinds
of
many
an
embezzlement
has
been
preceded
by
an
unlucky
plunge
on
the
turf
assuming
the
responsibility
for
this
disappearance
to
lie
between
hurst
and
and
the
bellinghams
said
i
with
an
uncomfortable
gulp
as
i
mentioned
the
names
of
my
friends
to
which
side
does
the
balance
of
probability
incline
to
the
side
of
hurst
i
should
say
without
doubt
replied
thorndyke
the
case
stands
thus
on
the
facts
presented
to
us
hurst
appears
to
have
had
no
motive
for
killing
the
deceased
as
we
will
call
him
but
the
man
was
seen
to
enter
the
house
was
never
seen
to
leave
it
and
was
never
again
seen
alive
bellingham
on
the
other
hand
had
a
motive
as
he
had
believed
himself
to
be
the
principal
beneficiary
under
the
will
but
the
deceased
was
not
seen
at
his
house
and
there
is
no
evidence
that
he
went
to
the
house
or
to
the
neighborhood
excepting
the
scarab
that
was
found
there
but
the
evidence
of
the
scarab
is
vitiated
by
the
fact
that
hurst
was
present
when
it
was
picked
up
and
that
it
was
found
on
a
spot
over
which
hurst
had
passed
only
a
few
minutes
previously
until
hurst
is
cleared
it
seems
to
me
that
the
presence
of
the
scarab
proves
nothing
against
the
bellinghams
then
your
opinions
on
the
case
said
i
are
based
entirely
on
the
facts
that
have
been
made
public
yes
mainly
i
do
not
necessarily
accept
those
facts
just
as
they
are
presented
and
i
may
have
certain
views
of
my
own
on
the
case
but
if
i
have
i
do
not
feel
in
a
position
to
discuss
them
for
the
present
discussion
has
to
be
limited
to
the
facts
and
inferences
offered
by
the
parties
concerned
there
exclaimed
jervis
rising
to
knock
his
pipe
out
that
is
where
thorndyke
has
you
he
lets
you
think
you
in
the
thick
of
the
until
one
fine
morning
you
wake
up
and
discover
that
you
have
only
been
a
gaping
outsider
and
then
you
are
mightily
astonished
and
so
are
the
other
side
too
for
that
matter
but
we
must
really
be
off
now
must
we
reverend
senior
i
suppose
we
must
replied
thorndyke
and
as
he
drew
on
his
gloves
he
asked
have
you
heard
from
barnard
lately
oh
yes
i
answered
i
wrote
to
him
at
smyrna
to
say
that
the
practise
was
flourishing
and
that
i
was
quite
happy
and
contented
and
that
he
might
stay
away
as
long
as
he
liked
he
writes
by
return
that
he
will
prolong
his
holiday
if
an
opportunity
offers
but
will
let
me
know
later
gad
said
jervis
it
was
a
stroke
of
luck
for
barnard
that
bellingham
happened
to
have
such
a
magnificent
daughter
there
mind
me
old
man
you
go
in
and
win
she
worth
it
is
she
thorndyke
miss
bellingham
a
very
charming
young
lady
replied
thorndyke
i
am
most
favorably
impressed
by
both
the
father
and
the
daughter
and
i
only
trust
that
we
may
be
able
to
be
of
some
service
to
them
with
this
sedate
little
speech
thorndyke
shook
my
hand
and
i
watched
my
two
friends
go
on
their
way
until
their
fading
shapes
were
swallowed
up
in
the
darkness
of
fetter
lane
chapter
xii
a
voyage
of
discovery
it
was
two
or
three
mornings
after
my
little
supper
party
that
as
i
stood
in
the
brushing
my
hat
preparatory
to
starting
on
my
morning
round
adolphus
appeared
at
the
door
to
announce
two
gentlemen
waiting
in
the
surgery
i
told
him
to
bring
them
in
and
a
moment
later
thorndyke
entered
accompanied
by
jervis
i
noted
that
they
looked
uncommonly
large
in
that
little
apartment
especially
thorndyke
but
i
had
no
time
to
consider
this
phenomenon
for
the
latter
when
he
had
shaken
my
hand
proceeded
at
once
to
explain
the
object
of
their
visit
we
have
come
to
ask
a
favor
berkeley
he
said
to
ask
you
to
do
us
a
very
great
service
in
the
interests
of
your
friends
the
bellinghams
you
know
i
shall
be
delighted
i
said
warmly
what
is
it
i
will
explain
you
know
or
perhaps
you
do
that
the
police
have
collected
all
the
bones
that
have
been
discovered
and
deposited
them
in
the
mortuary
at
woodford
where
they
are
to
be
viewed
by
the
jury
now
it
has
become
imperative
that
i
should
have
more
definite
and
reliable
information
than
i
can
get
from
the
newspapers
the
natural
thing
for
me
would
be
to
go
down
and
examine
them
myself
but
there
are
circumstances
that
make
it
very
desirable
that
my
connection
with
the
case
should
not
leak
out
consequently
i
ca
go
myself
and
for
the
same
reason
i
ca
send
jervis
on
the
other
hand
as
it
is
now
stated
pretty
openly
that
the
police
consider
the
bones
to
be
almost
certainly
those
of
john
bellingham
it
would
seem
perfectly
natural
that
you
as
godfrey
bellingham
doctor
should
go
down
to
view
them
on
his
behalf
i
should
like
to
i
said
i
would
give
anything
to
go
but
how
is
it
to
be
managed
it
would
mean
a
whole
day
off
and
leaving
the
practise
to
look
after
itself
i
think
it
could
be
managed
said
thorndyke
and
the
matter
is
really
important
for
two
reasons
one
is
that
the
inquest
opens
and
some
one
certainly
ought
to
be
there
to
watch
the
proceedings
on
godfrey
behalf
and
the
other
is
that
our
client
has
received
notice
from
hurst
solicitors
that
the
application
will
be
heard
in
the
probate
court
in
a
few
days
is
that
rather
sudden
i
asked
it
certainly
suggests
that
there
has
been
a
good
deal
more
activity
than
we
were
given
to
understand
but
you
see
the
importance
of
the
affair
the
inquest
will
be
a
sort
of
dress
rehearsal
for
the
probate
court
and
it
is
quite
essential
that
we
should
have
a
chance
of
estimating
the
management
yes
i
see
that
but
how
are
we
to
manage
about
the
practise
we
shall
find
you
a
substitute
through
a
medical
agent
yes
said
jervis
turcival
will
find
us
a
man
in
fact
he
has
done
it
i
saw
him
this
morning
he
has
a
man
who
is
waiting
up
in
town
to
negotiate
for
the
purchase
of
a
practise
and
who
would
do
the
job
for
a
couple
of
guineas
quite
a
reliable
man
only
say
the
word
and
i
will
run
off
to
adam
street
and
engage
him
definitely
very
well
you
engage
the
locum
tenens
and
i
will
be
prepared
to
start
for
woodford
as
soon
as
he
turns
up
excellent
said
thorndyke
that
is
a
great
weight
off
my
mind
and
if
you
could
manage
to
drop
in
this
evening
and
smoke
a
pipe
with
us
we
could
talk
over
the
plan
of
campaign
and
let
you
know
what
items
of
information
we
are
particularly
in
want
of
i
promised
to
turn
up
at
king
bench
walk
as
soon
after
eight
as
possible
and
my
two
friends
then
took
their
departure
leaving
me
to
set
out
in
high
spirits
on
my
scanty
round
of
visits
it
is
surprising
what
different
aspects
things
present
from
different
points
of
view
how
relative
are
our
estimates
of
the
conditions
and
circumstances
of
life
to
the
urban
workman
the
journeyman
baker
or
tailor
for
instance
laboring
year
in
year
out
in
a
single
building
a
holiday
ramble
on
hampstead
heath
is
a
veritable
voyage
of
discovery
whereas
to
the
sailor
the
shifting
panorama
of
the
whole
wide
world
is
but
the
commonplace
of
the
day
work
so
i
reflected
as
i
took
my
place
in
the
train
at
liverpool
street
on
the
following
day
there
had
been
a
time
when
a
trip
by
rail
to
the
borders
of
epping
forest
would
have
been
far
from
a
thrilling
experience
now
after
vegetating
in
the
little
world
of
fetter
lane
it
was
quite
an
adventure
the
enforced
inactivity
of
a
railway
journey
is
favorable
to
thought
and
i
had
much
to
think
about
the
last
few
weeks
had
witnessed
momentous
changes
in
my
outlook
new
interests
had
arisen
new
friendships
had
grown
up
and
above
all
there
had
stolen
into
my
life
that
supreme
influence
that
for
good
or
for
evil
according
to
my
fortune
was
to
color
and
pervade
it
even
to
its
close
those
few
days
of
companionable
labor
in
the
with
the
homely
hospitalities
of
the
and
the
pleasant
walks
homeward
through
the
friendly
london
streets
had
called
into
existence
a
new
world
a
world
in
which
the
gracious
personality
of
ruth
bellingham
was
the
one
dominating
reality
and
thus
as
i
leaned
back
in
the
corner
of
the
railway
carriage
with
an
unlighted
pipe
in
my
hand
the
events
of
the
immediate
past
together
with
those
more
problematical
ones
of
the
impending
future
occupied
me
rather
to
the
exclusion
of
the
business
of
the
moment
which
was
to
review
the
remains
collected
in
the
woodford
mortuary
until
as
the
train
approached
stratford
the
odors
of
the
soap
and
factories
poured
in
at
the
open
window
and
by
a
natural
association
of
ideas
brought
me
back
to
the
object
of
my
quest
as
to
the
exact
purpose
of
this
expedition
i
was
not
very
clear
but
i
knew
that
i
was
acting
as
thorndyke
proxy
and
thrilled
with
pride
at
the
thought
but
what
particular
light
my
investigations
were
to
throw
upon
the
intricate
bellingham
case
i
had
no
very
definite
idea
with
a
view
to
fixing
the
procedure
in
my
mind
i
took
thorndyke
written
instructions
from
my
pocket
and
read
them
over
carefully
they
were
very
full
and
explicit
making
ample
allowance
for
my
lack
of
experience
in
matters
do
not
appear
to
make
minute
investigations
or
in
any
way
excite
remark
ascertain
if
all
the
bones
belonging
to
each
region
are
present
and
if
not
which
are
missing
measure
the
extreme
length
of
the
principal
bones
and
compare
those
of
opposite
sides
examine
the
bones
with
reference
to
age
sex
and
muscular
development
of
the
deceased
note
the
presence
or
absence
of
signs
of
constitutional
disease
local
disease
of
bone
or
adjacent
structures
old
or
recent
injuries
and
any
other
departures
from
the
normal
or
usual
observe
the
presence
or
absence
of
adipocere
and
its
position
if
present
note
any
remains
of
tendons
ligaments
or
other
soft
structures
examine
the
sidcup
hand
with
reference
to
the
question
as
to
whether
the
finger
was
separated
before
or
after
death
estimate
the
probable
period
of
submersion
and
note
any
changes
as
mineral
or
organic
staining
due
to
the
character
of
the
water
or
mud
ascertain
the
circumstances
immediate
and
remote
that
led
to
the
discovery
of
the
bones
and
the
names
of
the
persons
concerned
in
those
circumstances
commit
all
information
to
writing
as
soon
as
possible
and
make
plans
and
diagrams
on
the
spot
if
circumstances
permit
preserve
an
impassive
exterior
listen
attentively
but
without
eagerness
ask
as
few
questions
as
possible
pursue
any
inquiry
that
your
observations
on
the
spot
may
suggest
these
were
my
instructions
and
considering
that
i
was
going
merely
to
inspect
a
few
dry
bones
they
appeared
rather
formidable
in
fact
the
more
i
read
them
over
the
greater
became
my
misgivings
as
to
my
qualifications
for
the
task
as
i
approached
the
mortuary
it
became
evident
that
some
at
least
of
thorndyke
admonitions
were
by
no
means
unnecessary
the
place
was
in
charge
of
a
police
sergeant
who
watched
my
approach
suspiciously
and
some
men
obviously
newspaper
reporters
hovered
about
the
entrance
like
a
pack
of
jackals
i
presented
the
coroner
order
which
marchmont
had
obtained
and
which
the
sergeant
read
with
his
back
against
the
wall
to
prevent
the
newspaper
men
from
looking
over
his
shoulder
my
credentials
being
found
satisfactory
the
door
was
unlocked
and
i
entered
accompanied
by
three
enterprising
reporters
whom
however
the
sergeant
summarily
ejected
and
locked
out
returning
to
usher
me
into
the
presence
and
to
observe
my
proceedings
with
intelligent
but
highly
embarrassing
interest
the
bones
were
laid
out
on
a
large
table
and
covered
with
a
sheet
which
the
sergeant
slowly
turned
back
watching
my
face
intently
as
he
did
so
to
note
the
impression
that
the
spectacle
made
upon
me
i
imagine
that
he
must
have
been
somewhat
disappointed
by
my
impassive
demeanor
for
the
remains
suggested
to
me
nothing
more
than
a
rather
shabby
set
of
student
osteology
the
whole
collection
had
been
set
out
by
the
police
surgeon
as
the
sergeant
informed
me
in
their
proper
anatomical
order
notwithstanding
which
i
counted
them
over
carefully
to
make
sure
that
none
were
missing
checking
them
by
the
list
with
which
thorndyke
had
furnished
me
i
see
you
have
found
the
left
i
remarked
observing
that
this
did
not
appear
in
the
list
yes
said
the
sergeant
that
turned
up
yesterday
evening
in
a
big
pond
called
baldwin
pond
in
the
sandpit
plain
near
little
monk
wood
is
that
near
here
i
asked
in
the
forest
up
loughton
way
was
the
reply
i
made
a
note
of
the
fact
on
which
the
sergeant
looked
as
if
he
was
sorry
he
had
mentioned
it
and
then
turned
my
attention
to
a
general
consideration
of
the
bones
before
examining
them
in
detail
their
appearance
would
have
been
improved
and
examination
facilitated
by
a
thorough
scrubbing
for
they
were
just
as
they
had
been
taken
from
their
respective
and
it
was
difficult
to
decide
whether
their
color
was
an
actual
stain
or
due
to
a
deposit
on
the
surface
in
any
case
as
it
affected
them
all
alike
i
thought
it
an
interesting
feature
and
made
a
note
of
it
they
bore
numerous
traces
of
their
sojourn
in
the
various
ponds
from
which
they
had
been
recovered
but
these
gave
me
little
help
in
determining
the
length
of
time
during
which
they
had
been
submerged
they
were
of
course
encrusted
with
mud
and
little
wisps
of
stuck
to
them
in
places
but
these
facts
furnished
only
the
vaguest
measure
of
time
some
of
the
traces
were
indeed
more
informing
to
several
of
the
bones
for
instance
there
adhered
the
dried
of
the
common
and
in
one
of
the
hollows
of
the
right
the
infraspinous
fossa
was
a
group
of
the
tubes
of
the
red
these
remains
gave
proof
of
a
considerable
period
of
submersion
and
since
they
could
not
have
been
deposited
on
the
bones
until
all
the
flesh
had
disappeared
they
furnished
evidence
that
some
time
a
month
or
two
at
any
rate
had
elapsed
since
this
had
happened
incidentally
too
their
distribution
showed
the
position
in
which
the
bones
had
lain
and
though
this
appeared
to
be
of
no
importance
in
the
existing
circumstances
i
made
careful
notes
of
the
situation
of
each
adherent
body
illustrating
their
position
by
rough
sketches
the
sergeant
watched
my
proceedings
with
an
indulgent
smile
you
making
a
regular
inventory
sir
he
remarked
as
if
you
were
going
to
put
up
for
auction
i
should
think
those
snails
eggs
would
be
much
help
in
identification
and
all
that
has
been
done
already
he
added
as
i
produced
my
no
doubt
i
replied
but
my
business
is
to
make
independent
observations
to
check
the
others
if
necessary
and
i
proceeded
to
measure
each
of
the
principal
bones
separately
and
to
compare
those
of
the
opposite
sides
the
agreement
in
dimensions
and
general
characteristics
of
the
pairs
of
bones
left
little
doubt
that
all
were
parts
of
one
skeleton
a
conclusion
that
was
confirmed
by
the
eburnated
patch
on
the
head
of
the
right
and
the
corresponding
patch
in
the
socket
of
the
right
when
i
had
finished
my
measurements
i
went
over
the
entire
series
of
bones
in
detail
examining
each
with
the
closest
attention
for
any
of
those
signs
which
thorndyke
had
indicated
and
eliciting
nothing
but
a
monotonously
reiterated
negative
they
were
distressingly
and
disappointingly
normal
well
sir
what
do
you
make
of
the
sergeant
asked
cheerfully
as
i
shut
up
my
notebook
and
straightened
my
back
whose
bones
are
they
are
they
bellingham
think
ye
i
should
be
very
sorry
to
say
whose
bones
they
are
i
replied
one
bone
is
very
much
like
another
you
know
i
suppose
it
is
he
agreed
but
i
thought
that
with
all
that
measuring
and
all
those
notes
you
might
have
arrived
at
something
definite
evidently
he
was
disappointed
in
me
and
i
was
somewhat
disappointed
in
myself
when
i
contrasted
thorndyke
elaborate
instructions
with
the
meager
result
of
my
investigations
for
what
did
my
discoveries
amount
to
and
how
much
was
the
inquiry
advanced
by
the
few
entries
in
my
notebook
the
bones
were
apparently
those
of
a
man
of
fair
though
not
remarkable
muscular
development
over
thirty
years
of
age
but
how
much
older
i
was
unable
to
say
his
height
i
judged
roughly
to
be
five
feet
eight
inches
but
my
measurements
would
furnish
data
for
a
more
exact
estimate
by
thorndyke
beyond
this
the
bones
were
quite
uncharacteristic
there
were
no
signs
of
disease
either
local
or
general
no
indications
of
injuries
either
old
or
recent
no
departures
of
any
kind
from
the
normal
or
usual
and
the
dismemberment
had
been
effected
with
such
care
that
there
was
not
a
single
scratch
on
any
of
the
separate
surfaces
of
adipocere
the
peculiar
waxy
or
soapy
substance
that
is
commonly
found
in
bodies
that
have
slowly
decayed
in
damp
situations
there
was
not
a
trace
and
the
only
remnant
of
the
soft
structures
was
a
faint
indication
like
a
spot
of
dried
glue
of
the
tendon
on
the
tip
of
the
right
elbow
the
sergeant
was
in
the
act
of
replacing
the
sheet
with
the
air
of
a
showman
who
has
just
given
an
exhibition
when
there
came
a
sharp
rapping
on
the
mortuary
door
the
officer
finished
spreading
the
sheet
with
official
precision
and
having
ushered
me
out
into
the
lobby
turned
the
key
and
admitted
three
persons
holding
the
door
open
after
they
had
entered
for
me
to
go
out
but
the
appearance
of
the
newcomers
inclined
me
to
linger
one
of
them
was
a
local
constable
evidently
in
official
charge
a
second
was
a
laboring
man
very
wet
and
muddy
who
carried
a
small
sack
while
in
the
third
i
thought
i
scented
a
professional
brother
the
sergeant
continued
to
hold
the
door
open
nothing
more
i
can
do
for
you
sir
he
asked
genially
is
that
the
divisional
surgeon
i
inquired
yes
i
am
the
divisional
surgeon
the
newcomer
answered
did
you
want
anything
of
me
this
said
the
sergeant
is
a
medical
gentleman
who
has
got
permission
from
the
coroner
to
inspect
the
remains
he
is
acting
for
the
family
of
the
deceased
i
mean
for
the
family
of
bellingham
he
added
in
answer
to
an
inquiring
glance
from
the
surgeon
i
see
said
the
latter
well
they
have
found
the
rest
of
the
trunk
including
i
understand
the
ribs
that
were
missing
from
the
other
part
is
that
so
davis
yes
sir
replied
the
constable
inspector
badger
says
all
the
ribs
is
here
and
all
the
bones
of
the
neck
as
well
the
inspector
seems
to
be
an
anatomist
i
remarked
the
sergeant
grinned
he
is
a
very
knowing
gentleman
is
badger
he
came
down
here
this
morning
quite
early
and
spent
a
long
time
looking
over
the
bones
and
checking
them
by
some
notes
in
his
i
fancy
he
got
something
on
but
he
was
precious
close
about
it
here
the
sergeant
shut
up
rather
suddenly
perhaps
contrasting
his
own
conduct
with
that
of
his
superior
let
us
have
these
new
bones
out
on
the
table
said
the
police
surgeon
take
the
sheet
off
and
do
shoot
them
out
as
if
they
were
coals
hand
them
out
carefully
the
laborer
fished
out
the
wet
and
muddy
bones
one
by
one
from
the
sack
and
as
he
laid
them
on
the
table
the
surgeon
arranged
them
in
their
proper
relative
positions
this
has
been
a
neatly
executed
job
he
remarked
none
of
your
clumsy
hacking
with
a
chopper
or
a
saw
the
bones
have
been
cleanly
separated
at
the
joints
the
fellow
who
did
this
must
have
had
some
anatomical
knowledge
unless
he
was
a
butcher
which
by
the
way
is
not
impossible
he
has
used
his
knife
uncommonly
skilfully
and
you
notice
that
each
arm
was
taken
off
with
the
scapula
attached
just
as
a
butcher
takes
off
a
shoulder
of
mutton
are
there
any
more
bones
in
that
bag
no
sir
replied
the
laborer
wiping
his
hands
with
an
air
of
finality
on
the
posterior
aspect
of
his
trousers
that
the
lot
the
surgeon
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
bones
as
he
gave
a
final
touch
to
their
arrangement
and
remarked
the
inspector
is
right
all
the
bones
of
the
neck
are
there
very
odd
do
you
think
so
you
mean
i
mean
that
this
very
eccentric
murderer
seems
to
have
given
himself
such
an
extraordinary
amount
of
trouble
for
no
reason
that
one
can
see
there
are
these
neck
vertebrae
for
instance
he
must
have
carefully
separated
the
skull
from
the
atlas
instead
of
just
cutting
through
the
neck
then
there
is
the
way
he
divided
the
trunk
the
twelfth
ribs
have
just
come
in
with
this
lot
but
the
twelfth
dorsal
vertebra
to
which
they
belong
was
attached
to
the
lower
half
imagine
the
trouble
he
must
have
taken
to
do
that
and
without
cutting
or
hacking
the
bones
about
either
it
is
extraordinary
this
is
rather
interesting
by
the
way
handle
it
carefully
he
picked
up
the
daintily
for
it
was
covered
with
wet
mud
and
handed
it
to
me
with
the
remark
that
is
the
most
definite
piece
of
evidence
we
have
you
mean
i
said
that
the
union
of
the
two
parts
into
a
single
mass
fixes
this
as
the
skeleton
of
an
elderly
man
yes
that
is
the
obvious
suggestion
which
is
confirmed
by
the
deposit
of
bone
in
the
you
can
tell
the
inspector
davis
that
i
have
checked
this
lot
of
bones
and
that
they
are
all
here
would
you
mind
writing
it
down
sir
said
the
constable
inspector
badger
said
i
was
to
have
everything
in
writing
the
surgeon
took
out
his
and
while
he
was
selecting
a
suitable
piece
of
paper
he
asked
did
you
form
any
opinion
as
to
the
height
of
the
deceased
yes
i
thought
he
would
be
about
five
feet
eight
here
i
caught
the
sergeant
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
a
knowing
leer
i
made
it
five
eight
and
a
half
said
the
police
surgeon
but
we
shall
know
better
when
we
have
seen
the
lower
where
was
this
lot
found
davis
in
the
pond
just
off
the
road
in
lord
bushes
sir
and
the
inspector
has
gone
off
now
to
never
mind
where
he
gone
interrupted
the
sergeant
you
just
answer
questions
and
attend
to
your
business
the
sergeant
reproof
conveyed
a
hint
to
me
on
which
i
was
not
slow
to
act
friendly
as
my
professional
colleague
was
it
was
clear
that
the
police
were
disposed
to
treat
me
as
an
interloper
who
was
to
be
kept
out
of
the
know
as
far
as
possible
accordingly
i
thanked
my
colleague
and
the
sergeant
for
their
courtesy
and
bidding
them
adieu
until
we
should
meet
at
the
inquest
took
my
departure
and
walked
away
quickly
until
i
found
an
inconspicuous
position
from
which
i
could
keep
the
door
of
the
mortuary
in
view
a
few
moments
later
i
saw
constable
davis
emerge
and
stride
away
up
the
road
i
watched
his
rapidly
diminishing
figure
until
he
had
gone
as
far
as
i
considered
desirable
and
then
i
set
forth
in
his
wake
the
road
led
straight
away
from
the
village
and
in
less
than
half
a
mile
entered
the
outskirts
of
the
forest
here
i
quickened
my
pace
to
close
up
somewhat
and
it
was
well
that
i
did
so
for
suddenly
he
diverged
from
the
road
into
a
green
lane
where
for
a
while
i
lost
sight
of
him
still
hurrying
forward
i
again
caught
sight
of
him
just
as
he
turned
off
into
a
narrow
path
that
entered
a
beech
wood
with
a
thickish
undergrowth
of
holly
along
which
i
followed
him
for
several
minutes
gradually
decreasing
the
distance
between
us
until
suddenly
there
fell
on
my
ear
a
rhythmical
sound
like
the
clank
of
a
pump
soon
after
i
caught
the
sound
of
men
voices
and
then
the
constable
struck
off
the
path
into
the
wood
i
now
advanced
more
cautiously
endeavoring
to
locate
the
search
party
by
the
sound
of
the
pump
and
when
i
had
done
this
i
made
a
little
detour
so
that
i
might
approach
from
the
opposite
direction
to
that
from
which
the
constable
had
appeared
still
guided
by
the
noise
of
the
pump
i
at
length
came
out
into
a
small
opening
among
the
trees
and
halted
to
survey
the
scene
the
center
of
the
opening
was
occupied
by
a
small
pond
not
more
than
a
dozen
yards
across
by
the
side
of
which
stood
a
builder
handcart
the
little
vehicle
had
evidently
been
used
to
convey
the
appliances
which
were
deposited
on
the
ground
near
it
and
which
consisted
of
a
large
tub
now
filled
with
water
a
shovel
a
rake
a
sieve
and
a
portable
pump
the
latter
being
fitted
with
a
long
delivery
hose
there
were
three
men
besides
the
constable
one
of
whom
was
working
the
handle
of
the
pump
while
another
was
glancing
at
a
paper
that
the
constable
had
just
delivered
to
him
he
looked
up
sharply
as
i
appeared
and
viewed
me
with
unconcealed
disfavor
hallo
sir
said
he
you
ca
come
here
now
seeing
that
i
was
actually
here
this
was
clearly
a
mistake
and
i
ventured
to
point
out
the
fallacy
well
i
ca
allow
you
to
stay
here
our
business
is
of
a
private
nature
i
know
exactly
what
your
business
is
inspector
badger
oh
do
you
said
he
surveying
me
with
a
foxy
smile
and
i
expect
i
know
what
yours
is
too
but
we
ca
have
any
of
you
newspaper
gentry
spying
on
us
just
at
present
so
you
just
be
off
i
thought
it
best
to
undeceive
him
at
once
and
accordingly
having
explained
who
i
was
i
showed
him
the
coroner
permit
which
he
read
with
manifest
annoyance
this
is
all
very
well
sir
said
he
as
he
handed
me
back
the
paper
but
it
does
authorize
you
to
come
spying
on
the
proceedings
of
the
police
any
remains
that
we
discover
will
be
deposited
in
the
mortuary
where
you
can
inspect
them
to
your
heart
content
but
you
ca
stay
here
and
watch
us
i
had
no
defined
object
in
keeping
a
watch
on
the
proceedings
but
the
sergeant
indiscreet
hint
had
aroused
my
curiosity
which
was
further
excited
by
badger
evident
desire
to
get
rid
of
me
moreover
while
we
had
been
talking
the
pump
had
stopped
the
muddy
floor
of
the
pond
being
now
pretty
fully
exposed
and
the
inspector
assistant
was
handling
the
shovel
impatiently
now
i
put
it
to
you
inspector
said
i
persuasively
is
it
politic
of
you
to
allow
it
to
be
said
that
you
refused
an
authorized
representative
of
the
family
facilities
for
verifying
any
statements
that
you
may
make
hereafter
what
do
you
mean
he
asked
i
mean
that
if
you
should
happen
to
find
some
bone
which
could
be
identified
as
part
of
the
body
of
bellingham
that
fact
would
be
of
more
importance
to
his
family
than
to
anyone
else
you
know
that
there
is
a
very
valuable
estate
and
a
rather
difficult
will
i
did
know
it
and
i
do
see
the
bearing
of
it
now
neither
did
i
for
that
matter
but
if
you
make
such
a
point
of
being
present
at
the
search
i
ca
very
well
refuse
only
you
must
get
in
our
way
that
all
on
hearing
this
conclusion
his
assistant
who
looked
like
a
officer
took
up
his
shovel
and
stepped
into
the
mud
that
formed
the
bottom
of
the
pond
stooping
as
he
went
and
peering
among
the
masses
of
weed
that
had
been
left
stranded
by
the
withdrawal
of
the
water
the
inspector
watched
him
anxiously
cautioning
him
from
time
to
time
to
look
out
where
he
was
treading
the
laborer
left
the
pump
and
craned
forward
from
the
margin
of
the
mud
and
the
constable
and
i
looked
on
from
our
respective
points
of
vantage
for
some
time
the
search
was
fruitless
once
the
searcher
stooped
and
picked
up
what
turned
out
to
be
a
fragment
of
decayed
wood
then
the
remains
of
a
jay
were
discovered
examined
and
rejected
suddenly
the
man
bent
down
by
the
side
of
a
small
pool
that
had
been
left
in
one
of
the
deeper
hollows
stared
intently
into
the
mud
and
stood
up
there
something
here
that
looks
like
a
bone
sir
he
sang
out
do
grub
about
then
said
the
inspector
drive
your
shovel
right
into
the
mud
where
you
saw
it
and
bring
it
to
the
sieve
the
man
followed
out
these
instructions
and
as
he
came
shoreward
with
a
great
pile
of
the
slimy
mud
on
his
shovel
we
all
converged
on
the
sieve
which
the
inspector
took
up
and
held
over
the
tub
directing
the
constable
and
laborer
to
lend
a
hand
meaning
thereby
that
they
were
to
crowd
round
the
tub
and
exclude
me
as
completely
as
possible
this
in
fact
they
did
very
effectively
with
his
assistance
for
when
the
shovelful
of
mud
had
been
deposited
on
the
sieve
the
four
men
leaned
over
it
and
so
nearly
hid
it
from
view
that
it
was
only
by
craning
over
first
on
one
side
and
then
on
the
other
that
i
was
able
to
catch
an
occasional
glimpse
of
it
and
to
observe
it
gradually
melting
away
as
the
sieve
immersed
in
the
water
was
shaken
to
and
fro
presently
the
inspector
raised
the
sieve
from
the
water
and
stooped
over
it
more
closely
to
examine
its
contents
apparently
the
examination
yielded
no
very
conclusive
results
for
it
was
accompanied
by
a
series
of
rather
dubious
grunts
at
length
the
officer
stood
up
and
turning
to
me
with
a
genial
but
foxy
smile
held
out
the
sieve
for
my
inspection
like
to
see
what
we
have
found
doctor
said
he
i
thanked
him
and
stood
over
the
sieve
it
contained
the
sort
of
litter
of
twigs
skeleton
leaves
weed
dead
shells
and
mussels
that
one
would
expect
to
strain
out
from
the
mud
of
an
ancient
pond
but
in
addition
to
these
there
were
three
small
bones
which
at
first
glance
gave
me
quite
a
start
until
i
saw
what
they
were
the
inspector
looked
at
me
inquiringly
h
said
he
yes
i
replied
very
interesting
those
will
be
human
bones
i
fancy
h
i
should
say
so
undoubtedly
i
answered
now
said
the
inspector
could
you
say
offhand
which
finger
those
bones
belong
to
i
smothered
a
grin
for
i
had
been
expecting
this
question
and
answered
i
can
say
offhand
that
they
do
belong
to
any
finger
they
are
the
bones
of
the
left
great
toe
the
inspector
jaw
dropped
the
deuce
they
are
he
muttered
h
i
thought
they
looked
a
bit
stout
i
expect
said
i
that
if
you
go
through
the
mud
close
to
where
this
came
from
you
find
the
rest
of
the
foot
the
man
proceeded
at
once
to
act
on
my
suggestion
taking
the
sieve
with
him
to
save
time
and
sure
enough
after
filling
it
twice
with
the
mud
from
the
bottom
of
the
pool
the
entire
skeleton
of
the
foot
was
brought
to
light
now
you
happy
i
suppose
said
the
inspector
when
i
had
checked
the
bones
and
found
them
all
present
i
should
be
more
happy
i
replied
if
i
knew
what
you
were
searching
for
in
this
pond
you
were
looking
for
the
foot
were
you
i
was
looking
for
anything
that
i
might
find
he
answered
i
shall
go
on
searching
until
we
have
the
whole
body
i
shall
go
through
all
the
streams
and
ponds
around
here
excepting
connaught
water
that
i
shall
leave
to
the
last
as
it
will
be
a
case
of
dredging
from
a
boat
and
is
so
likely
as
the
smaller
ponds
perhaps
the
head
will
be
there
it
deeper
than
any
of
the
others
it
now
occurred
to
me
that
as
i
had
learned
all
that
i
was
likely
to
learn
which
was
little
enough
i
might
as
well
leave
the
inspector
to
pursue
his
researches
unembarrassed
by
my
presence
accordingly
i
thanked
him
for
his
assistance
and
departed
by
the
way
i
had
come
but
as
i
retraced
my
steps
along
the
shady
path
i
speculated
profoundly
on
the
officer
proceedings
my
examinations
of
the
mutilated
hand
had
yielded
the
conclusion
that
the
finger
had
been
removed
after
death
or
shortly
before
but
more
probably
after
some
one
else
had
evidently
arrived
at
the
same
conclusion
and
had
communicated
his
opinion
to
inspector
badger
for
it
was
clear
that
that
gentleman
was
in
full
cry
after
the
missing
finger
but
why
was
he
searching
for
it
here
when
the
hand
had
been
found
at
sidcup
and
what
did
he
expect
to
learn
from
it
when
he
found
it
there
is
nothing
particularly
characteristic
about
a
finger
or
at
least
the
bones
of
one
and
the
object
of
the
present
researches
was
to
determine
the
identity
of
the
person
of
whom
these
bones
were
the
remains
there
was
something
mysterious
about
the
affair
something
suggesting
that
inspector
badger
was
in
possession
of
private
information
of
some
kind
but
what
information
could
he
have
and
whence
could
he
have
obtained
it
these
were
questions
to
which
i
could
find
no
answer
and
i
was
still
fruitlessly
revolving
them
when
i
arrived
at
the
modest
inn
where
the
inquest
was
to
be
held
and
where
i
proposed
to
fortify
myself
with
a
correspondingly
modest
lunch
as
a
preparation
for
my
attendance
at
the
inquiry
chapter
xiii
the
coroner
quest
the
proceedings
of
that
fine
old
institution
the
coroner
court
are
apt
to
have
their
dignity
impaired
by
the
somewhat
unjudicial
surroundings
amidst
which
they
are
conducted
the
present
inquiry
was
to
be
held
in
a
long
room
attached
to
the
inn
ordinarily
devoted
as
its
various
appurtenances
testified
to
gatherings
of
a
more
convivial
character
hither
i
betook
myself
after
a
protracted
lunch
and
a
meditative
pipe
and
being
the
first
to
arrive
the
jury
having
already
been
sworn
and
conducted
to
the
mortuary
to
view
the
remains
whiled
away
the
time
by
considering
the
habits
of
the
customary
occupants
of
the
room
by
the
light
of
the
objects
contained
in
it
a
wooden
target
with
one
or
two
darts
sticking
in
it
hung
on
the
end
wall
and
invited
the
robin
hoods
of
the
village
to
try
their
skill
a
system
of
incised
marks
on
the
oaken
table
made
sinister
suggestions
of
and
a
large
open
box
filled
with
white
wigs
gaudily
colored
robes
and
wooden
spears
swords
and
regalia
crudely
coated
with
gilded
paper
obviously
appertained
to
the
puerile
ceremonials
of
the
order
of
druids
i
had
exhausted
the
interest
of
these
relics
and
had
transferred
my
attentions
to
the
picture
gallery
when
the
other
spectators
and
the
witnesses
began
to
arrive
hastily
i
seated
myself
in
the
only
comfortable
chair
beside
the
one
placed
at
the
head
of
the
table
presumably
for
the
coroner
and
i
had
hardly
done
so
when
the
latter
entered
accompanied
by
the
jury
immediately
after
them
came
the
sergeant
inspector
badger
one
or
two
men
and
finally
the
divisional
surgeon
the
coroner
took
his
seat
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
opened
his
book
and
the
jury
seated
themselves
on
a
couple
of
benches
on
one
side
of
the
long
table
i
looked
with
some
interest
at
the
twelve
good
men
and
true
they
were
a
representative
group
of
british
tradesmen
quiet
attentive
and
rather
solemn
but
my
attention
was
particularly
attracted
by
a
small
man
with
a
very
large
head
and
a
shock
of
upstanding
hair
whom
i
had
diagnosed
after
a
glance
at
his
intelligent
but
truculent
countenance
and
the
shiny
knees
of
his
trousers
as
the
village
cobbler
he
sat
between
the
foreman
who
looked
like
a
blacksmith
and
a
dogged
man
whose
general
aspect
of
prosperous
greasiness
suggested
the
calling
of
a
butcher
the
inquiry
gentlemen
the
coroner
commenced
upon
which
we
are
now
entering
concerns
itself
with
two
questions
the
first
is
that
of
identity
who
was
this
person
whose
body
we
have
just
viewed
the
second
is
how
when
and
by
what
means
did
he
come
by
his
death
we
will
take
the
identity
first
and
begin
with
the
circumstances
under
which
the
body
was
discovered
here
the
cobbler
stood
up
and
raised
an
excessively
dirty
hand
i
rise
chairman
said
he
to
a
point
of
order
the
other
jurymen
looked
at
him
curiously
and
some
of
them
i
regret
to
say
grinned
you
have
referred
sir
he
continued
to
the
body
which
we
have
just
viewed
i
wish
to
point
out
that
we
have
not
viewed
a
body
we
have
viewed
a
collection
of
bones
we
will
refer
to
them
as
the
remains
if
you
prefer
it
said
the
coroner
i
do
prefer
it
was
the
reply
and
the
objector
sat
down
very
well
rejoined
the
coroner
and
he
proceeded
to
call
the
witnesses
of
whom
the
first
was
a
laborer
who
had
discovered
the
bones
in
the
do
you
happen
to
know
how
long
it
was
since
the
had
been
cleaned
out
previously
the
coroner
asked
when
the
witness
had
told
the
story
of
the
discovery
they
was
cleaned
out
by
tapper
orders
just
before
he
gave
them
up
that
will
be
a
little
better
than
two
years
ago
in
may
it
were
i
helped
to
clean
i
worked
on
this
very
same
place
and
there
was
no
bones
there
then
the
coroner
glanced
at
the
jury
any
questions
gentlemen
he
asked
the
cobbler
directed
an
intimidating
scowl
at
the
witness
and
demanded
were
you
searching
for
bones
when
you
came
on
these
remains
me
exclaimed
the
witness
what
should
i
be
searching
for
bones
for
do
prevaricate
said
the
cobbler
sternly
answer
the
question
yes
or
no
no
of
course
i
was
the
juryman
shook
his
enormous
head
dubiously
as
though
implying
that
he
would
let
it
pass
this
time
but
it
must
happen
again
and
the
examination
of
the
witnesses
continued
without
eliciting
anything
that
was
new
to
me
or
giving
rise
to
any
incident
until
the
sergeant
had
described
the
finding
of
the
right
arm
in
the
cuckoo
pits
was
this
an
accidental
discovery
the
coroner
asked
no
we
had
instructions
from
scotland
yard
to
search
any
likely
ponds
in
this
neighborhood
the
coroner
discreetly
forbore
to
press
this
matter
any
further
but
my
friend
the
cobbler
was
evidently
on
the
qui
vive
and
i
anticipated
a
brisk
for
badger
when
his
turn
came
the
inspector
was
apparently
of
the
same
opinion
for
i
saw
him
cast
a
glance
of
the
deepest
malevolence
at
the
too
inquiring
disciple
of
crispin
in
fact
his
turn
came
next
and
the
cobbler
hair
stood
up
with
unholy
joy
the
finding
of
the
lower
half
of
the
trunk
in
staple
pond
at
loughton
was
the
inspector
own
achievement
but
he
was
not
boastful
about
it
the
discovery
he
remarked
followed
naturally
on
the
previous
one
in
the
cuckoo
pits
had
you
any
private
information
that
led
you
to
search
this
particular
neighborhood
the
cobbler
asked
we
had
no
private
information
whatever
replied
badger
now
i
put
it
to
you
pursued
the
juryman
shaking
a
forensic
and
very
dirty
forefinger
at
the
inspector
here
are
certain
remains
found
at
sidcup
here
are
certain
other
remains
found
at
mary
cray
and
certain
others
at
lee
all
those
places
are
in
kent
now
is
it
very
remarkable
that
you
should
come
straight
down
to
epping
forest
which
is
in
essex
and
search
for
those
bones
and
find
we
were
making
a
systematic
search
of
all
likely
places
replied
badger
exactly
said
the
cobbler
with
a
ferocious
grin
that
just
my
point
i
say
is
it
very
funny
that
after
finding
the
remains
in
kent
some
twenty
miles
from
here
with
the
river
thames
between
you
should
come
here
to
look
for
the
bones
and
go
straight
to
pond
where
they
happen
to
be
and
find
it
would
have
been
more
funny
badger
replied
sourly
if
we
gone
straight
to
a
place
where
they
happened
to
be
and
found
them
a
gratified
snigger
arose
from
the
other
eleven
good
men
and
true
and
the
cobbler
grinned
savagely
but
before
he
could
think
of
a
suitable
rejoinder
the
coroner
interposed
the
question
is
not
very
material
he
said
and
we
must
embarrass
the
police
by
unnecessary
inquiries
it
my
belief
said
the
cobbler
that
he
knew
they
were
there
all
the
time
the
witness
has
stated
that
he
had
no
private
information
said
the
coroner
and
he
proceeded
to
take
the
rest
of
the
inspector
evidence
watched
closely
by
the
critical
juror
the
account
of
the
finding
of
the
remains
having
been
given
in
full
the
police
surgeon
was
called
and
sworn
the
jurymen
straightened
their
backs
with
an
air
of
expectancy
and
i
turned
over
a
page
of
my
notebook
you
have
examined
the
bones
at
present
lying
in
the
mortuary
and
forming
the
subject
of
this
inquiry
the
coroner
asked
i
have
will
you
kindly
tell
us
what
you
have
observed
i
find
that
the
bones
are
human
bones
and
are
in
my
opinion
all
parts
of
the
same
person
they
form
a
skeleton
which
is
complete
with
the
exception
of
the
skull
the
third
finger
of
the
left
hand
the
and
the
i
mean
the
bones
between
the
knees
and
the
ankles
is
there
anything
to
account
for
the
absence
of
the
missing
finger
no
there
is
no
deformity
and
no
sign
of
its
having
been
amputated
during
life
in
my
opinion
it
was
removed
after
death
can
you
give
us
any
description
of
the
deceased
i
should
say
that
these
are
the
bones
of
an
elderly
man
probably
over
sixty
years
of
age
about
five
feet
eight
and
a
half
inches
in
height
of
rather
stout
build
fairly
muscular
and
well
preserved
there
are
no
signs
of
disease
excepting
some
rheumatic
gout
of
the
right
can
you
form
any
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
death
no
there
are
no
marks
of
violence
or
signs
of
injury
but
it
will
be
impossible
to
form
any
opinion
as
to
the
cause
of
death
until
we
have
seen
the
skull
did
you
note
anything
else
of
importance
yes
i
was
struck
by
the
appearance
of
anatomical
knowledge
and
skill
on
the
part
of
the
person
who
dismembered
the
body
the
knowledge
of
anatomy
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
the
corpse
has
been
divided
into
definite
anatomical
regions
for
instance
the
bones
of
the
neck
are
complete
and
include
the
top
joint
of
the
backbone
known
as
the
atlas
whereas
a
person
without
anatomical
knowledge
would
probably
take
off
the
head
by
cutting
through
the
neck
then
the
arms
have
been
separated
with
the
scapula
or
and
clavicle
or
attached
just
as
an
arm
would
be
removed
for
dissection
the
skill
is
shown
by
the
neat
way
in
which
the
dismemberment
has
been
carried
out
the
parts
have
not
been
rudely
hacked
asunder
but
have
been
separated
at
the
joints
so
skilfully
that
i
have
not
discovered
a
single
scratch
or
mark
of
the
knife
on
any
of
the
bones
can
you
suggest
any
class
of
person
who
would
be
likely
to
possess
the
knowledge
and
skill
to
which
you
refer
it
would
of
course
be
possessed
by
a
surgeon
or
medical
student
and
possibly
by
a
butcher
you
think
that
the
person
who
dismembered
this
body
may
have
been
a
surgeon
or
a
medical
student
yes
or
a
butcher
some
one
accustomed
to
the
dismemberment
of
bodies
and
skilful
with
the
knife
here
the
cobbler
suddenly
rose
to
his
feet
i
rise
chairman
said
he
to
protest
against
the
statement
that
has
just
been
made
what
statement
demanded
the
coroner
against
the
aspersion
continued
the
cobbler
with
an
oratorical
flourish
that
has
been
cast
upon
a
honorable
calling
i
do
understand
you
said
the
coroner
doctor
summers
has
insinuated
that
this
murder
was
committed
by
a
butcher
now
a
member
of
that
honorable
calling
is
sitting
on
this
jury
you
let
me
alone
growled
the
butcher
i
will
not
let
you
alone
persisted
the
cobbler
i
desire
oh
shut
up
pope
this
was
from
the
foreman
who
at
the
same
moment
reached
out
an
enormous
hairy
hand
with
which
he
grabbed
the
cobbler
and
brought
him
into
a
sitting
posture
with
a
thump
that
shook
the
room
but
pope
though
seated
was
not
silenced
i
desire
he
said
to
have
my
protest
put
on
record
i
ca
do
that
said
the
coroner
and
i
ca
allow
you
to
interrupt
the
witnesses
i
am
acting
said
pope
in
the
interests
of
my
friend
here
and
the
members
of
a
honorable
but
here
the
butcher
turned
on
him
savagely
and
in
a
hoarse
exclaimed
look
here
pope
you
got
too
much
of
what
the
cat
licks
gentlemen
gentlemen
the
coroner
protested
sternly
i
can
not
permit
this
unseemly
conduct
you
are
forgetting
the
solemnity
of
the
occasion
and
your
own
responsible
positions
i
must
insist
on
more
decent
and
decorous
behavior
there
was
profound
silence
in
the
midst
of
which
the
butcher
concluded
in
the
same
hoarse
whisper
licks
paws
with
the
coroner
cast
a
withering
glance
at
him
and
turning
to
the
witness
resumed
the
examination
can
you
tell
us
doctor
how
long
a
time
has
elapsed
since
the
death
of
the
deceased
i
should
say
not
less
than
eighteen
months
but
probably
more
how
much
more
it
is
impossible
from
inspection
alone
to
say
the
bones
are
perfectly
clean
that
is
clean
of
all
soft
structures
and
will
remain
substantially
in
their
present
condition
for
many
years
the
evidence
of
the
man
who
found
the
remains
in
the
suggests
that
they
could
not
have
been
there
for
more
than
two
years
do
the
appearances
in
your
opinion
agree
with
that
view
yes
perfectly
there
is
one
more
point
doctor
a
very
important
one
do
you
find
anything
in
any
of
the
bones
or
all
of
them
together
which
would
enable
you
to
identify
them
as
the
bones
of
any
particular
individual
no
replied
summers
i
found
no
peculiarity
that
could
furnish
the
means
of
personal
identification
the
description
of
a
missing
individual
has
been
given
to
us
said
the
coroner
a
man
years
of
age
five
feet
eight
inches
in
height
healthy
well
preserved
rather
broad
in
build
and
having
an
old
pott
fracture
of
the
left
ankle
do
the
remains
that
you
have
examined
agree
with
that
description
yes
so
far
as
agreement
is
possible
there
is
no
disagreement
the
remains
might
be
those
of
that
individual
they
might
but
there
is
no
positive
evidence
that
they
are
the
description
would
apply
to
a
large
proportion
of
elderly
men
except
as
to
the
fracture
you
found
no
signs
of
such
a
fracture
no
pott
fracture
affects
the
bone
called
the
fibula
that
is
one
of
the
bones
that
has
not
yet
been
found
so
there
is
no
evidence
on
that
point
the
left
foot
was
quite
normal
but
then
it
would
be
in
any
case
unless
the
fracture
had
resulted
in
great
deformity
you
estimated
the
height
of
the
deceased
as
half
an
inch
greater
than
that
of
the
missing
person
does
that
constitute
a
disagreement
no
my
estimate
is
only
approximate
as
the
arms
are
complete
and
the
legs
are
not
i
have
based
my
calculations
on
the
width
across
the
two
arms
but
measurement
of
the
gives
the
same
result
the
length
of
the
is
one
foot
seven
inches
and
so
the
deceased
might
not
have
been
taller
than
five
feet
eight
that
is
so
from
five
feet
eight
to
five
feet
nine
thank
you
i
think
that
is
all
we
want
to
ask
you
doctor
unless
the
jury
wish
to
put
any
questions
he
glanced
uneasily
at
that
august
body
and
instantly
the
irrepressible
pope
rose
to
the
occasion
about
that
finger
that
is
missing
said
the
cobbler
you
say
that
it
was
cut
off
after
death
that
is
my
opinion
now
can
you
tell
us
why
it
was
cut
off
no
i
can
not
oh
come
now
doctor
summers
you
must
have
formed
some
opinion
on
the
subject
here
the
coroner
interposed
the
doctor
is
only
concerned
with
the
evidence
arising
out
of
the
actual
examination
of
the
remains
any
personal
opinions
or
conjectures
that
he
may
have
formed
are
not
evidence
and
he
must
not
be
asked
about
them
but
sir
objected
pope
we
want
to
know
why
that
finger
was
cut
off
it
could
have
been
took
off
for
no
reason
may
i
ask
sir
if
the
person
who
is
missing
had
anything
peculiar
about
that
finger
nothing
is
stated
to
that
effect
in
the
written
description
replied
the
coroner
perhaps
suggested
pope
inspector
badger
can
tell
us
i
think
said
the
coroner
we
had
better
not
ask
the
police
too
many
questions
they
will
tell
us
anything
that
they
wish
to
be
made
public
oh
very
well
snapped
the
cobbler
if
it
a
matter
of
hushing
it
up
i
got
no
more
to
say
only
i
do
see
how
we
are
to
arrive
at
a
verdict
if
we
do
have
the
facts
put
before
us
all
the
witnesses
having
now
been
examined
the
coroner
proceeded
to
sum
up
and
address
the
jury
you
have
heard
the
evidence
gentlemen
of
the
various
witnesses
and
you
will
have
perceived
that
it
does
not
enable
us
to
answer
either
of
the
questions
that
form
the
subject
of
this
inquiry
we
now
know
that
the
deceased
was
an
elderly
man
about
sixty
years
of
age
and
about
five
feet
eight
to
nine
in
height
and
that
his
death
took
place
from
eighteen
months
to
two
years
ago
that
is
all
we
know
from
the
treatment
to
which
the
body
has
been
subjected
we
may
form
conjectures
as
to
the
circumstances
of
his
death
but
we
have
no
actual
knowledge
we
do
not
know
who
the
deceased
was
or
how
he
came
by
his
death
consequently
it
will
be
necessary
to
adjourn
this
inquiry
until
fresh
facts
are
available
and
as
soon
as
that
is
the
case
you
will
receive
due
notice
that
your
attendance
is
required
the
silence
of
the
court
gave
place
to
the
confused
noise
of
moving
chairs
and
a
general
outbreak
of
eager
talk
amidst
which
i
rose
and
made
my
way
out
into
the
street
at
the
door
i
encountered
summers
whose
was
waiting
close
by
are
you
going
back
to
town
now
he
asked
yes
i
answered
as
soon
as
i
can
catch
a
train
if
you
jump
into
my
cart
i
run
you
down
in
time
for
the
you
miss
it
if
you
walk
i
accepted
his
offer
thankfully
and
a
minute
later
was
spinning
briskly
down
the
road
to
the
station
queer
little
devil
that
man
pope
summers
remarked
quite
a
character
a
socialist
laborite
agitator
general
crank
anything
for
a
row
yes
i
answered
that
was
what
his
appearance
suggested
it
must
be
trying
for
the
coroner
to
get
a
truculent
rascal
like
that
on
a
jury
summers
laughed
i
do
know
he
supplies
the
comic
relief
and
then
you
know
those
fellows
have
their
uses
some
of
his
questions
were
pretty
pertinent
so
badger
seemed
to
think
yes
by
jove
chuckled
summers
badger
did
like
him
a
bit
and
i
suspect
the
worthy
inspector
was
sailing
pretty
close
to
the
wind
in
his
answers
you
think
he
really
has
some
private
information
depends
upon
what
you
mean
by
the
police
are
not
a
speculative
body
they
would
be
taking
all
this
trouble
unless
they
had
a
pretty
straight
tip
from
somebody
how
are
and
miss
bellingham
i
used
to
know
them
when
they
lived
here
i
was
considering
a
discreet
answer
to
this
question
when
we
swept
into
the
station
yard
at
the
same
moment
the
train
drew
up
at
the
platform
and
with
a
hurried
and
hastily
spoken
thanks
i
sprang
from
the
and
darted
into
the
station
during
the
rather
slow
journey
homeward
i
read
over
my
notes
and
endeavored
to
extract
from
the
facts
they
set
forth
some
significance
other
than
that
which
lay
on
the
surface
but
without
much
success
then
i
fell
to
speculating
on
what
thorndyke
would
think
of
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
and
whether
he
would
be
satisfied
with
the
information
that
i
had
collected
these
speculations
lasted
me
with
occasional
digressions
until
i
arrived
at
the
temple
and
ran
up
the
stairs
rather
eagerly
to
my
friends
chambers
but
here
a
disappointment
awaited
me
the
nest
was
empty
with
the
exception
of
polton
who
appeared
at
the
laboratory
door
in
his
white
apron
with
a
pair
of
pliers
in
his
hands
the
doctor
had
to
go
down
to
bristol
to
consult
over
an
urgent
case
he
explained
and
doctor
jervis
has
gone
with
him
they
be
away
a
day
or
two
i
expect
but
the
doctor
left
this
note
for
you
he
took
a
letter
from
the
shelf
where
it
had
been
stood
conspicuously
on
edge
and
handed
it
to
me
it
was
a
short
note
from
thorndyke
apologizing
for
his
sudden
departure
and
asking
me
to
give
polton
my
notes
with
any
comments
that
i
had
to
make
you
will
be
interested
to
learn
he
added
that
the
application
will
be
heard
in
the
probate
court
the
day
after
i
shall
not
be
present
of
course
nor
will
jervis
so
i
should
like
you
to
attend
and
keep
your
eyes
open
for
anything
that
may
happen
during
the
hearing
and
that
may
not
appear
in
the
notes
that
marchmont
clerk
will
be
instructed
to
take
i
have
retained
payne
to
stand
by
and
help
you
with
the
practise
so
that
you
can
attend
the
court
with
a
clear
conscience
this
was
highly
flattering
and
quite
atoned
for
the
small
disappointment
with
deep
gratification
at
the
trust
that
thorndyke
had
reposed
in
me
i
pocketed
the
letter
handed
my
notes
to
polton
wished
him
and
betook
myself
to
fetter
lane
chapter
xiv
which
carries
the
reader
into
the
probate
court
the
probate
court
wore
an
air
of
studious
repose
when
i
entered
with
miss
bellingham
and
her
father
apparently
the
great
and
inquisitive
public
had
not
become
aware
of
the
proceedings
that
were
about
to
take
place
or
had
not
realized
their
connection
with
the
sensational
mutilation
case
but
barristers
and
pressmen
better
informed
had
gathered
in
some
strength
and
the
hum
of
their
conversation
filled
the
air
like
the
droning
of
the
voluntary
that
ushers
in
a
cathedral
service
as
we
entered
a
elderly
gentleman
rose
and
came
forward
to
meet
us
shaking
bellingham
hand
cordially
and
saluting
miss
bellingham
with
a
courtly
bow
this
is
marchmont
doctor
said
the
former
introducing
me
and
the
solicitor
having
thanked
me
for
the
trouble
i
had
taken
in
attending
at
the
inquest
led
us
to
a
bench
at
the
farther
end
of
which
was
seated
a
gentleman
whom
i
recognized
as
hurst
bellingham
recognized
him
at
the
same
moment
and
glared
at
him
wrathfully
i
see
that
scoundrel
is
here
he
exclaimed
in
a
distinctly
audible
voice
pretending
that
he
does
see
me
because
he
is
ashamed
to
look
me
in
the
face
but
hush
hush
my
dear
sir
exclaimed
the
horrified
solicitor
we
must
talk
like
that
especially
in
this
place
let
me
beg
you
let
me
entreat
you
to
control
your
feelings
to
make
no
indiscreet
remarks
in
fact
to
make
no
remarks
at
all
he
added
with
the
evident
conviction
that
any
remarks
that
bellingham
might
make
would
be
certain
to
be
indiscreet
forgive
me
marchmont
bellingham
replied
contritely
i
will
control
myself
i
will
really
be
quite
discreet
i
wo
even
look
at
him
again
because
if
i
do
i
shall
probably
go
over
and
pull
his
nose
this
form
of
discretion
did
not
appear
to
be
quite
to
liking
for
he
took
the
precaution
of
insisting
that
miss
bellingham
and
i
should
sit
on
the
farther
side
of
his
client
and
thus
effectually
separate
him
from
his
enemy
who
the
fellow
talking
to
jellicoe
bellingham
asked
that
is
loram
hurst
counsel
and
the
gentleman
next
to
him
is
our
counsel
heath
a
most
able
man
and
here
marchmont
whispered
behind
his
hand
fully
instructed
by
doctor
thorndyke
at
this
juncture
the
judge
entered
and
took
his
seat
the
usher
proceeded
with
great
rapidity
to
swear
in
the
jury
and
the
court
gradually
settled
down
into
that
state
of
academic
quiet
which
it
maintained
throughout
the
proceedings
excepting
when
the
noisy
were
set
oscillating
by
some
bustling
clerk
or
reporter
the
judge
was
a
somewhat
old
gentleman
very
short
as
to
his
face
and
very
long
as
to
his
mouth
which
peculiarities
together
with
a
pair
of
large
and
bulging
eyes
which
he
usually
kept
closed
suggested
a
certain
resemblance
to
a
frog
and
he
had
a
curious
trick
of
flattening
his
eyelids
as
if
in
the
act
of
swallowing
a
large
beetle
which
was
the
only
outward
and
visible
sign
of
emotion
that
he
ever
displayed
as
soon
as
the
swearing
in
of
the
jury
was
completed
loram
rose
to
introduce
the
case
whereupon
his
lordship
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
closed
his
eyes
as
if
bracing
himself
for
a
painful
operation
the
present
proceedings
loram
explained
are
occasioned
by
the
unaccountable
disappearance
of
john
bellingham
of
queen
square
bloomsbury
which
occurred
about
two
years
ago
or
to
be
more
precise
on
the
of
november
nineteen
hundred
and
two
since
that
date
nothing
has
been
heard
of
bellingham
and
as
there
are
certain
substantial
reasons
for
believing
him
to
be
dead
the
principal
beneficiary
under
his
will
george
hurst
is
now
applying
to
the
court
for
permission
to
presume
the
death
of
the
testator
and
prove
the
will
as
the
time
which
has
elapsed
since
the
testator
was
last
seen
alive
is
only
two
years
the
application
is
based
upon
the
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
which
were
in
many
respects
very
singular
the
most
remarkable
feature
of
that
disappearance
being
perhaps
its
suddenness
and
completeness
here
the
judge
remarked
in
a
still
small
voice
that
it
would
perhaps
have
been
even
more
remarkable
if
the
testator
had
disappeared
gradually
and
incompletely
no
doubt
my
lord
agreed
loram
but
the
point
is
that
the
testator
whose
habits
had
always
been
regular
and
orderly
disappeared
on
the
date
mentioned
without
having
made
any
of
the
usual
provisions
for
the
conduct
of
his
affairs
and
has
not
since
then
been
seen
or
heard
of
with
this
preamble
loram
proceeded
to
give
a
narrative
of
the
events
connected
with
the
disappearance
of
john
bellingham
which
was
substantially
identical
with
that
which
i
had
read
in
the
newspapers
and
having
laid
the
actual
facts
before
the
jury
he
went
on
to
discuss
their
probable
import
now
what
conclusion
he
asked
will
this
strange
this
most
mysterious
train
of
events
suggest
to
an
intelligent
person
who
shall
consider
it
impartially
here
is
a
man
who
steps
forth
from
the
house
of
his
cousin
or
his
brother
as
the
case
may
be
and
forthwith
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
vanishes
from
human
ken
what
is
the
explanation
did
he
steal
forth
and
without
notice
or
hint
of
his
intention
take
train
to
some
seaport
thence
to
embark
for
some
distant
land
leaving
his
affairs
to
take
care
of
themselves
and
his
friends
to
speculate
vainly
as
to
his
whereabouts
is
he
now
hiding
abroad
or
even
at
home
indifferent
alike
to
the
safety
of
his
own
considerable
property
and
the
peace
of
mind
of
his
friends
or
is
it
that
death
has
come
upon
him
unawares
by
sickness
by
accident
or
more
probably
by
the
hand
of
some
unknown
criminal
let
us
consider
the
probabilities
can
he
have
disappeared
by
his
own
deliberate
act
why
not
it
may
be
asked
men
undoubtedly
do
disappear
from
time
to
time
to
be
discovered
by
chance
or
to
reappear
voluntarily
after
intervals
of
years
and
find
their
names
almost
forgotten
and
their
places
filled
by
yes
but
there
is
always
some
reason
for
a
disappearance
of
this
kind
even
though
it
be
a
bad
one
family
discords
that
make
life
a
weariness
pecuniary
difficulties
that
make
life
a
succession
of
anxieties
distaste
for
particular
circumstances
and
surroundings
from
which
there
seems
no
escape
inherent
restlessness
and
vagabond
tendencies
and
so
on
do
any
of
these
explanations
apply
to
the
present
case
no
they
do
not
family
discords
at
least
those
capable
of
producing
chronic
misery
appertain
exclusively
to
a
married
state
but
the
testator
was
a
bachelor
with
no
encumbrances
whatever
pecuniary
anxieties
can
be
equally
excluded
the
testator
was
in
easy
in
fact
in
affluent
circumstances
his
mode
of
life
was
apparently
agreeable
and
full
of
interest
and
activity
and
he
had
full
liberty
of
change
if
he
wished
he
had
been
accustomed
to
travel
and
could
do
so
again
without
absconding
he
had
reached
an
age
when
radical
changes
do
not
seem
desirable
he
was
a
man
of
fixed
and
regular
habits
and
his
regularity
was
of
his
own
choice
and
not
due
to
compulsion
or
necessity
when
last
seen
by
his
friends
as
i
shall
prove
he
was
proceeding
to
a
definite
destination
with
the
expressed
intention
of
returning
for
purposes
of
his
own
appointing
he
did
return
and
then
vanished
leaving
those
purposes
unachieved
if
we
conclude
that
he
has
voluntarily
disappeared
and
is
at
present
in
hiding
we
adopt
an
opinion
that
is
entirely
at
variance
with
all
these
weighty
facts
if
on
the
other
hand
we
conclude
that
he
has
died
suddenly
or
has
been
killed
by
an
accident
or
otherwise
we
are
adopting
a
view
that
involves
no
inherent
improbabilities
and
that
is
entirely
congruous
with
the
known
facts
facts
that
will
be
proved
by
the
testimony
of
the
witnesses
whom
i
shall
call
the
supposition
that
the
testator
is
dead
is
not
only
more
probable
than
that
he
is
alive
i
submit
it
is
the
only
reasonable
explanation
of
the
circumstances
of
his
disappearance
but
this
is
not
all
the
presumption
of
death
which
arises
so
inevitably
out
of
the
mysterious
and
abrupt
manner
in
which
the
testator
disappeared
has
recently
received
most
conclusive
and
dreadful
confirmation
on
the
fifteenth
of
july
last
there
were
discovered
at
sidcup
the
remains
of
a
human
arm
a
left
arm
gentlemen
from
the
hand
of
which
the
third
or
ring
finger
was
missing
the
doctor
who
has
examined
that
arm
will
tell
you
that
the
finger
was
cut
off
either
after
death
or
immediately
before
and
his
evidence
will
prove
conclusively
that
that
arm
must
have
been
deposited
in
the
place
where
it
was
found
just
about
the
time
when
the
testator
disappeared
since
that
first
discovery
other
portions
of
the
same
mutilated
body
have
come
to
light
and
it
is
a
strange
and
significant
fact
that
they
have
all
been
found
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
of
eltham
or
woodford
you
will
remember
gentlemen
that
it
was
either
at
eltham
or
woodford
that
the
testator
was
last
seen
alive
and
now
observe
the
completeness
of
the
coincidence
these
human
remains
as
you
will
be
told
presently
by
the
experienced
and
learned
medical
gentleman
who
has
examined
them
most
exhaustively
are
those
of
a
man
of
about
sixty
years
of
age
about
five
feet
eight
inches
in
height
fairly
muscular
and
well
preserved
apparently
healthy
and
rather
stoutly
built
another
witness
will
tell
you
that
the
missing
man
was
about
sixty
years
of
age
about
five
feet
eight
inches
in
height
fairly
muscular
and
well
preserved
apparently
healthy
and
rather
stoutly
built
and
another
most
significant
and
striking
fact
the
testator
was
accustomed
to
wear
upon
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
the
very
finger
that
is
missing
from
the
remains
that
were
found
a
most
peculiar
ring
which
fitted
so
tightly
that
he
was
unable
to
get
it
off
after
once
putting
it
on
a
ring
gentlemen
of
so
peculiar
a
pattern
that
had
it
been
found
on
the
body
must
have
instantly
established
the
identity
of
the
remains
in
a
word
gentlemen
the
remains
which
have
been
found
are
those
of
a
man
exactly
like
the
testator
they
differ
from
him
in
no
respects
whatever
they
display
a
mutilation
which
suggests
an
attempt
to
conceal
an
identifying
peculiarity
which
he
undoubtedly
presented
and
they
were
deposited
in
their
various
about
the
time
of
the
testator
disappearance
accordingly
when
you
have
heard
these
facts
proved
by
the
sworn
testimony
of
competent
witnesses
together
with
the
facts
relating
to
the
disappearance
i
shall
ask
you
for
a
verdict
in
accordance
with
that
evidence
loram
sat
down
and
adjusting
a
pair
of
rapidly
glanced
over
his
brief
while
the
usher
was
administering
the
oath
to
the
first
witness
this
was
jellicoe
who
stepped
into
the
box
and
directed
a
stony
gaze
at
the
apparently
unconscious
judge
the
usual
preliminaries
having
been
gone
through
loram
proceeded
to
examine
him
you
were
the
testator
solicitor
and
confidential
agent
i
believe
i
was
and
am
how
long
have
you
known
him
years
judging
from
your
experience
of
him
should
you
say
that
he
was
a
person
likely
to
disappear
voluntarily
and
suddenly
to
cease
to
communicate
with
his
friends
no
kindly
give
your
reasons
for
that
opinion
such
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
testator
would
be
entirely
opposed
to
his
habits
and
character
as
they
are
known
to
me
he
was
exceedingly
regular
and
in
his
dealings
with
me
when
traveling
abroad
he
always
kept
me
informed
as
to
his
whereabouts
or
if
he
was
likely
to
be
beyond
reach
of
communication
he
always
advised
me
beforehand
one
of
my
duties
was
to
collect
a
pension
which
he
drew
from
the
foreign
office
and
on
no
occasion
previous
to
his
disappearance
has
he
ever
failed
to
furnish
me
punctually
with
the
necessary
documents
had
he
so
far
as
you
know
any
reasons
for
wishing
to
disappear
no
when
and
where
did
you
last
see
him
alive
at
six
in
the
evening
on
the
fourteenth
of
october
nineteen
hundred
and
two
at
queen
square
bloomsbury
kindly
tell
us
what
happened
on
that
occasion
the
testator
had
called
for
me
at
my
office
at
a
quarter
past
three
and
asked
me
to
come
with
him
to
his
house
to
meet
doctor
norbury
i
accompanied
him
to
queen
square
and
shortly
after
we
arrived
doctor
norbury
came
to
look
at
some
antiquities
that
the
testator
proposed
to
give
to
the
british
museum
the
gift
consisted
of
a
mummy
with
four
canopic
jars
and
other
which
the
testator
stipulated
should
be
exhibited
together
in
a
single
case
and
in
the
state
in
which
they
were
then
presented
of
these
objects
the
mummy
only
was
ready
for
inspection
the
had
not
yet
arrived
in
england
but
was
expected
within
a
week
doctor
norbury
accepted
the
gift
on
behalf
of
the
museum
but
could
not
take
possession
of
the
objects
until
he
had
communicated
with
the
director
and
obtained
his
formal
authority
the
testator
accordingly
gave
me
certain
instructions
concerning
the
delivery
of
the
gift
as
he
was
leaving
england
that
evening
are
those
instructions
relevant
to
the
subject
of
this
inquiry
i
think
they
are
the
testator
was
going
to
paris
and
perhaps
from
thence
to
vienna
he
instructed
me
to
receive
and
unpack
the
on
its
arrival
and
to
store
it
with
the
mummy
in
a
particular
room
where
it
was
to
remain
for
three
weeks
if
he
returned
within
that
time
he
was
to
hand
it
over
in
person
to
the
museum
authorities
if
he
had
not
returned
within
that
time
he
desired
me
to
notify
the
museum
authorities
that
they
were
at
liberty
to
take
possession
of
and
remove
the
collection
at
their
convenience
from
these
instructions
i
gathered
that
the
testator
was
uncertain
as
to
the
length
of
his
absence
from
england
and
the
extent
of
his
journey
did
he
state
precisely
where
he
was
going
no
he
said
he
was
going
to
paris
and
perhaps
to
vienna
but
he
gave
no
particulars
and
i
asked
for
none
do
you
in
fact
know
where
he
went
no
he
left
the
house
at
six
wearing
a
long
heavy
overcoat
and
carrying
a
and
an
umbrella
i
wished
him
at
the
door
and
watched
him
walk
away
as
if
going
toward
southampton
row
i
have
no
idea
where
he
went
and
i
never
saw
him
again
had
he
no
other
luggage
than
the
i
do
not
know
but
i
believe
not
he
was
accustomed
to
travel
with
the
bare
necessaries
and
to
buy
anything
further
he
wanted
did
he
say
nothing
to
the
servants
as
to
the
probable
date
of
his
return
there
were
no
servants
excepting
the
caretaker
the
house
was
not
used
for
residential
purposes
the
testator
slept
and
took
his
meals
at
his
club
though
he
kept
his
clothes
at
the
house
did
you
receive
any
communication
from
him
after
he
left
no
i
never
heard
from
him
again
in
any
way
i
waited
for
three
weeks
as
he
had
instructed
me
and
then
notified
the
museum
authorities
that
the
collection
was
ready
for
removal
five
days
later
doctor
norbury
came
and
took
formal
possession
of
it
and
it
was
transferred
to
the
museum
forthwith
when
did
you
next
hear
of
the
testator
on
the
of
november
following
at
a
seven
in
the
evening
george
hurst
came
to
my
rooms
which
are
over
my
office
and
informed
me
that
the
testator
had
called
at
his
house
during
his
absence
and
had
been
shown
into
the
study
to
wait
for
him
that
on
his
hurst
arrival
it
was
found
that
the
testator
had
disappeared
without
acquainting
the
servants
of
his
intended
departure
and
without
being
seen
by
anyone
to
leave
the
house
hurst
thought
this
so
remarkable
that
he
had
hastened
up
to
town
to
inform
me
i
also
thought
it
a
remarkable
circumstance
especially
as
i
had
received
no
communication
from
the
testator
and
we
both
decided
that
it
was
advisable
to
inform
the
testator
brother
godfrey
of
what
had
happened
accordingly
hurst
and
i
proceeded
as
quickly
as
possible
to
liverpool
street
and
took
the
first
train
available
to
woodford
where
godfrey
bellingham
then
resided
we
arrived
at
his
house
at
five
minutes
to
nine
and
were
informed
by
the
servant
that
he
was
not
at
home
but
that
his
daughter
was
in
the
library
which
was
a
detached
building
situated
in
the
grounds
the
servant
lighted
a
lantern
and
conducted
us
through
the
grounds
to
the
library
where
we
found
godfrey
bellingham
and
miss
bellingham
godfrey
had
only
just
come
in
and
had
entered
by
the
back
gate
which
had
a
bell
that
rang
in
the
library
hurst
informed
godfrey
of
what
had
occurred
and
then
we
left
the
library
to
walk
up
to
the
house
a
few
paces
from
the
library
i
noticed
by
the
light
of
the
lantern
which
godfrey
was
carrying
a
small
object
lying
on
the
lawn
i
pointed
it
out
to
him
and
he
picked
it
up
and
then
we
all
recognized
it
as
a
scarab
that
the
testator
was
accustomed
to
wear
on
his
it
was
fitted
with
a
gold
wire
passed
through
the
suspension
hole
and
a
gold
ring
both
the
wire
and
the
ring
were
in
position
but
the
ring
was
broken
we
went
to
the
house
and
questioned
the
servants
as
to
visitors
but
none
of
them
had
seen
the
testator
and
they
all
agreed
that
no
visitor
whatsoever
had
come
to
the
house
during
the
afternoon
or
evening
godfrey
and
miss
bellingham
both
declared
that
they
had
neither
seen
nor
heard
anything
of
the
testator
and
were
both
unaware
that
he
had
returned
to
england
as
the
circumstances
were
somewhat
disquieting
i
communicated
on
the
following
morning
with
the
police
and
requested
them
to
make
inquiries
which
they
did
with
the
result
that
a
bearing
the
initials
b
was
found
to
be
lying
unclaimed
in
the
cloakroom
at
charing
cross
station
i
was
able
to
identify
the
as
that
which
i
had
seen
the
testator
carry
away
from
queen
square
i
was
also
able
to
identify
some
of
the
contents
i
interviewed
the
cloakroom
attendant
who
informed
me
that
the
had
been
deposited
on
the
about
he
had
no
recollection
of
the
person
who
deposited
it
it
remained
unclaimed
in
the
possession
of
the
railway
company
for
three
months
and
was
then
surrendered
to
me
were
there
any
marks
or
labels
on
it
showing
the
route
by
which
it
had
traveled
there
were
no
labels
on
it
and
no
marks
other
than
the
initials
b
do
you
happen
to
know
the
testator
age
yes
he
was
on
the
eleventh
of
october
nineteen
hundred
and
two
can
you
tell
us
what
his
height
was
yes
he
was
exactly
five
feet
eight
inches
what
sort
of
health
had
he
so
far
as
i
know
his
health
was
good
i
am
not
aware
that
he
suffered
from
any
disease
i
am
only
judging
by
his
appearance
which
was
that
of
a
healthy
man
should
you
describe
him
as
well
preserved
or
otherwise
i
should
describe
him
as
a
well
preserved
man
for
his
age
how
should
you
describe
his
figure
i
should
describe
him
as
rather
broad
and
stout
in
build
and
fairly
muscular
though
not
exceptionally
so
loram
made
a
rapid
note
of
these
answers
and
then
said
you
have
told
us
jellicoe
that
you
have
known
the
testator
intimately
for
years
now
did
you
ever
notice
whether
he
was
accustomed
to
wear
any
rings
upon
his
fingers
he
wore
upon
the
third
finger
of
his
left
hand
a
copy
of
an
antique
ring
which
bore
the
device
of
the
eye
of
osiris
that
was
the
only
ring
he
ever
wore
as
far
as
i
know
did
he
wear
it
constantly
yes
necessarily
because
it
was
too
small
for
him
and
having
once
squeezed
it
on
he
was
never
able
to
get
it
off
again
this
was
the
sum
of
jellicoe
evidence
and
at
its
conclusion
the
witness
glanced
inquiringly
at
bellingham
counsel
but
heath
remained
seated
attentively
considering
the
notes
that
he
had
just
made
and
finding
that
there
was
to
be
no
jellicoe
stepped
down
from
the
box
i
leaned
back
on
my
bench
and
turning
my
head
observed
miss
bellingham
deep
in
thought
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
asked
it
seems
very
complete
and
conclusive
she
replied
and
then
with
a
sigh
she
murmured
poor
old
uncle
john
how
horrid
it
sounds
to
talk
of
him
in
this
way
as
testator
as
if
he
were
nothing
but
a
sort
of
algebraical
sign
there
is
much
room
for
sentiment
i
suppose
in
the
proceedings
of
the
probate
court
i
replied
to
which
she
assented
and
then
asked
who
is
this
lady
this
lady
was
a
fashionably
dressed
young
woman
who
had
just
bounced
into
the
and
was
now
being
sworn
the
preliminaries
being
finished
she
answered
miss
bellingham
question
and
loram
by
stating
that
her
name
was
augustina
gwendoline
dobbs
and
that
she
was
housemaid
to
george
hurst
of
the
poplars
eltham
hurst
lives
alone
i
believe
said
loram
i
do
know
what
you
mean
by
that
miss
dobbs
began
but
the
barrister
explained
i
mean
that
i
believe
he
is
unmarried
well
and
what
about
it
the
witness
demanded
tartly
i
am
asking
you
a
question
i
know
that
said
the
witness
viciously
and
i
say
that
you
no
business
to
make
any
such
insinuations
to
a
respectable
young
lady
when
there
a
and
a
kitchenmaid
living
in
the
house
and
him
old
enough
to
be
my
father
here
his
lordship
flattened
his
eyelids
with
startling
effect
and
loram
interrupted
i
make
no
insinuations
i
merely
ask
is
your
employer
hurst
an
unmarried
man
or
is
he
not
i
never
asked
him
said
the
witness
sulkily
please
answer
my
question
yes
or
no
how
can
i
answer
your
question
he
may
be
married
or
he
may
not
how
do
i
know
i
no
private
detective
loram
directed
a
stupefied
gaze
at
the
witness
and
in
the
ensuing
silence
a
plaintiff
transcriber
note
plaintive
voice
came
from
the
bench
is
that
point
material
certainly
my
lord
replied
loram
then
as
i
see
that
you
are
calling
hurst
perhaps
you
had
better
put
the
question
to
him
he
will
probably
know
loram
bowed
and
as
the
judge
subsided
into
his
normal
state
of
coma
he
turned
to
the
triumphant
witness
do
you
remember
anything
remarkable
occurring
on
the
of
november
the
year
before
last
yes
john
bellingham
called
at
our
house
how
did
you
know
he
was
john
bellingham
i
did
but
he
said
he
was
and
i
supposed
he
knew
at
what
time
did
he
arrive
at
twenty
minutes
past
five
in
the
evening
what
happened
then
i
told
him
that
hurst
had
not
come
home
yet
and
he
said
he
would
wait
for
him
in
the
study
and
write
some
letters
so
i
showed
him
into
the
study
and
shut
the
door
what
happened
next
nothing
then
hurst
came
home
at
his
usual
time
a
quarter
to
six
and
let
himself
in
with
his
key
he
went
straight
into
the
study
where
i
supposed
bellingham
still
was
so
i
took
no
notice
but
laid
the
table
for
two
at
six
hurst
came
into
the
he
has
tea
in
the
city
and
dines
at
six
and
when
he
saw
the
table
laid
for
two
he
asked
the
reason
i
said
i
thought
bellingham
was
staying
to
dinner
bellingham
says
he
did
know
he
was
here
why
you
tell
me
he
says
thought
he
was
with
you
sir
i
said
showed
him
into
the
study
i
said
he
was
there
when
i
came
in
he
said
he
is
there
now
he
said
he
has
gone
to
wait
in
the
he
said
so
he
went
and
looked
in
the
but
he
was
there
then
hurst
said
he
thought
bellingham
must
have
got
tired
of
waiting
and
gone
away
but
i
told
him
i
was
quite
sure
he
had
because
i
had
been
watching
all
the
time
then
he
asked
me
if
bellingham
was
alone
or
whether
his
daughter
was
with
him
and
i
said
that
it
was
bellingham
at
all
but
john
bellingham
and
then
he
was
more
surprised
than
ever
i
said
we
had
better
search
the
house
to
make
sure
whether
he
was
there
or
not
and
hurst
said
he
would
come
with
me
so
we
all
went
over
the
house
and
looked
in
all
the
rooms
but
there
was
not
a
sign
of
bellingham
in
any
of
them
then
hurst
got
very
nervous
and
upset
and
when
he
had
just
snatched
a
little
dinner
he
ran
off
to
catch
the
six
train
up
to
town
you
say
that
bellingham
could
not
have
left
the
house
because
you
were
watching
all
the
time
where
were
you
while
you
were
watching
i
was
in
the
kitchen
i
could
see
the
front
gate
from
the
kitchen
window
you
say
that
you
laid
the
table
for
two
where
did
you
lay
it
in
the
of
course
could
you
see
the
front
gate
from
the
no
but
i
could
see
the
study
door
the
study
is
opposite
the
do
you
have
to
come
upstairs
to
get
from
the
kitchen
to
the
yes
of
course
you
do
then
might
not
bellingham
have
left
the
house
while
you
were
coming
up
the
stairs
no
he
could
have
done
why
not
because
it
would
have
been
impossible
but
why
would
it
have
been
impossible
because
he
could
have
done
it
i
suggest
that
bellingham
left
the
house
quietly
while
you
were
on
the
stairs
no
he
did
how
do
you
know
he
did
not
i
am
quite
sure
he
did
but
how
can
you
be
certain
because
i
should
have
seen
him
if
he
had
but
i
mean
when
you
were
on
the
stairs
he
was
in
the
study
when
i
was
on
the
stairs
how
do
you
know
he
was
in
the
study
because
i
showed
him
in
there
and
he
had
come
out
loram
paused
and
took
a
deep
breath
and
his
lordship
flattened
his
eyelids
is
there
a
side
gate
to
the
premises
the
barrister
resumed
wearily
yes
it
opens
into
a
narrow
lane
at
the
side
of
the
house
and
there
is
a
french
window
in
the
study
is
there
not
yes
it
opens
on
to
the
small
grass
plot
opposite
the
side
gate
the
window
and
the
gate
both
have
catches
on
the
transcriber
note
possibly
missing
words
could
it
have
been
possible
for
bellingham
to
let
himself
out
into
the
lane
the
window
and
gate
both
have
catches
on
the
inside
he
could
have
got
out
that
way
but
of
course
he
did
why
not
well
no
gentleman
would
go
creeping
out
the
back
way
like
a
thief
did
you
look
to
see
if
the
french
window
was
shut
and
fastened
after
you
missed
mr
bellingham
i
looked
at
it
when
we
shut
the
house
up
for
the
night
it
was
then
shut
and
fastened
on
the
inside
and
the
side
gate
that
gate
was
shut
and
latched
you
have
to
slam
the
gate
to
make
the
latch
fasten
so
no
one
could
have
gone
out
of
the
gate
without
being
heard
here
the
ended
and
loram
sat
down
with
an
audible
sigh
of
relief
miss
dobbs
was
about
to
step
down
from
the
when
heath
rose
to
did
you
see
bellingham
in
a
good
light
he
asked
pretty
good
it
was
dark
outside
but
the
was
alight
kindly
look
at
this
here
a
small
object
was
passed
across
to
the
witness
it
is
a
trinket
that
bellingham
is
stated
to
have
carried
suspended
from
his
can
you
remember
if
he
was
wearing
it
in
that
manner
when
he
came
to
the
house
no
he
was
not
you
are
sure
of
that
quite
sure
thank
you
and
now
i
want
to
ask
you
about
the
search
that
you
have
mentioned
you
say
that
you
went
all
over
the
house
did
you
go
into
the
study
no
at
least
not
until
hurst
had
gone
to
london
when
you
did
go
in
was
the
window
fastened
yes
could
it
have
been
fastened
from
the
outside
no
there
is
no
handle
outside
what
furniture
is
there
in
the
study
there
is
a
a
two
easy
chairs
two
large
and
a
wardrobe
that
hurst
keeps
his
overcoats
and
hats
in
does
the
wardrobe
lock
yes
was
it
locked
when
you
went
in
i
sure
i
do
know
i
do
go
about
trying
the
cupboards
and
drawers
what
furniture
is
there
in
the
a
cabinet
six
or
seven
chairs
a
chesterfield
sofa
a
piano
a
and
one
or
two
occasional
tables
is
the
piano
a
grand
or
upright
it
is
an
upright
grand
in
what
position
is
it
placed
it
stands
across
a
corner
near
the
window
is
there
sufficient
room
behind
it
for
a
man
to
conceal
himself
miss
dobbs
was
amused
and
did
not
dissemble
oh
yes
she
sniggered
there
plenty
of
room
for
a
man
to
hide
behind
it
when
you
searched
the
did
you
look
behind
the
piano
no
i
did
miss
dobbs
replied
scornfully
did
you
look
under
the
sofa
certainly
not
what
did
you
do
then
we
opened
the
door
and
looked
into
the
room
we
were
not
looking
for
a
cat
or
a
monkey
we
were
looking
for
a
gentleman
and
am
i
to
take
it
that
your
search
over
the
rest
of
the
house
was
conducted
in
a
similar
manner
certainly
we
looked
into
the
rooms
but
we
did
not
search
under
the
beds
or
in
the
cupboards
are
all
the
rooms
in
the
house
in
use
as
living
or
sleeping
rooms
no
there
is
one
room
on
the
second
floor
that
is
used
as
a
store
and
and
one
on
the
first
floor
that
hurst
uses
to
store
trunks
and
things
that
he
is
not
using
did
you
look
in
those
rooms
when
you
searched
the
house
no
have
you
looked
in
them
since
i
have
been
in
the
since
but
not
in
the
other
it
is
always
kept
locked
at
this
point
an
ominous
flattening
became
apparent
in
his
eyelids
but
these
symptoms
passed
when
heath
sat
down
and
indicated
that
he
had
no
further
questions
to
ask
miss
dobbs
once
more
prepared
to
step
down
from
the
witness
box
when
loram
shot
up
like
a
you
have
made
certain
statements
said
he
concerning
the
scarab
which
bellingham
was
accustomed
to
wear
suspended
from
his
you
say
that
he
was
not
wearing
it
when
he
came
to
hurst
house
on
the
of
november
nineteen
hundred
and
two
are
you
quite
sure
of
that
quite
sure
i
must
ask
you
to
be
very
careful
in
your
statement
on
this
point
the
question
is
a
highly
important
one
do
you
swear
that
the
scarab
was
not
hanging
from
his
yes
i
do
did
you
notice
the
particularly
no
not
particularly
then
what
makes
you
sure
that
the
scarab
was
not
attached
to
it
it
could
have
been
why
could
it
not
because
if
it
had
been
there
i
should
have
seen
it
what
kind
of
was
bellingham
wearing
oh
an
ordinary
sort
of
i
mean
was
it
a
chain
or
a
ribbon
or
a
strap
a
chain
i
think
or
perhaps
a
ribbon
or
it
might
have
been
a
strap
his
lordship
flattened
his
eyelids
but
made
no
further
sign
and
loram
continued
did
you
or
did
you
not
notice
what
kind
of
bellingham
was
wearing
i
did
not
why
should
i
it
was
no
business
of
mine
but
yet
you
are
quite
sure
about
the
scarab
yes
quite
sure
you
noticed
that
then
no
i
did
how
could
i
when
it
was
there
loram
paused
and
looked
helplessly
at
the
witness
a
suppressed
titter
arose
from
the
body
of
the
court
and
a
faint
voice
from
the
bench
inquired
are
you
incapable
of
giving
a
straightforward
answer
miss
dobbs
only
reply
was
to
burst
into
tears
whereupon
loram
abruptly
sat
down
and
abandoned
his
the
vacated
by
miss
dobbs
was
occupied
successively
by
norbury
hurst
and
the
attendant
none
of
whom
contributed
any
new
facts
but
merely
corroborated
the
statements
made
by
jellicoe
and
the
housemaid
then
came
the
laborer
who
discovered
the
bones
at
sidcup
and
who
repeated
the
evidence
that
he
had
given
at
the
inquest
showing
that
the
remains
could
not
have
been
lying
in
the
more
than
two
years
finally
summers
was
called
and
after
he
had
given
a
brief
description
of
the
bones
that
he
had
examined
was
asked
by
loram
you
have
heard
the
description
that
jellicoe
has
given
of
the
testator
i
have
does
that
description
apply
to
the
person
whose
remains
you
examined
in
a
general
way
it
does
i
must
ask
you
for
a
direct
answer
yes
or
no
does
it
apply
yes
but
i
ought
to
say
that
my
estimate
of
the
height
of
the
deceased
is
only
approximate
quite
so
judging
from
your
examination
of
those
remains
and
from
jellicoe
description
might
those
remains
be
the
remains
of
the
testator
john
bellingham
yes
they
might
on
receiving
this
admission
loram
sat
down
and
heath
immediately
rose
to
when
you
examined
these
remains
doctor
summers
did
you
discover
any
personal
peculiarities
which
would
enable
you
to
identify
them
as
the
remains
of
any
one
individual
rather
than
any
other
individual
of
similar
size
age
and
proportions
no
i
found
nothing
that
would
identify
the
remains
as
those
of
any
particular
individual
as
heath
asked
no
further
questions
the
witness
received
his
dismissal
and
loram
informed
the
court
that
that
was
his
case
the
judge
bowed
somnolently
and
then
heath
rose
to
address
the
court
on
behalf
of
the
respondent
it
was
not
a
long
speech
nor
was
it
enriched
by
any
displays
of
florid
rhetoric
it
concerned
itself
exclusively
with
a
rebutment
of
the
arguments
of
the
counsel
for
the
petitioner
having
briefly
pointed
out
that
the
period
of
absence
was
too
short
to
give
rise
of
itself
to
the
presumption
of
death
heath
continued
the
claim
therefore
rests
upon
evidence
of
a
positive
character
my
learned
friend
asserts
that
the
testator
is
presumably
dead
and
it
is
for
him
to
prove
what
he
has
affirmed
now
has
he
done
this
i
submit
that
he
has
not
he
has
argued
with
great
force
and
ingenuity
that
the
testator
being
a
bachelor
a
solitary
man
without
wife
or
child
dependant
or
master
public
or
private
office
of
duty
or
any
bond
responsibility
or
any
other
condition
limiting
his
freedom
of
action
had
no
reason
or
inducement
for
absconding
this
is
my
learned
friend
argument
and
he
has
conducted
it
with
so
much
skill
and
ingenuity
that
he
has
not
only
succeeded
in
proving
his
case
he
has
proved
a
great
deal
too
much
for
if
it
is
true
as
my
learned
friend
so
justly
argues
that
a
man
thus
unfettered
by
obligations
of
any
kind
has
no
reason
for
disappearing
is
it
not
even
more
true
that
he
has
no
reason
for
not
disappearing
my
friend
has
urged
that
the
testator
was
at
liberty
to
go
where
he
pleased
when
he
pleased
and
how
he
pleased
and
that
therefore
there
was
no
need
for
him
to
abscond
i
reply
if
he
was
at
liberty
to
go
away
whither
when
and
how
he
pleased
why
do
we
express
surprise
that
he
has
made
use
of
his
liberty
my
learned
friend
points
out
that
the
testator
notified
nobody
of
his
intention
of
going
away
and
has
acquainted
no
one
with
his
whereabouts
but
i
ask
whom
should
he
have
notified
he
was
responsible
to
nobody
there
was
no
one
dependent
upon
him
his
presence
or
absence
was
the
concern
of
nobody
but
himself
if
circumstances
suddenly
arising
made
it
desirable
that
he
should
go
abroad
why
should
he
not
go
i
say
there
was
no
reason
whatever
my
learned
friend
has
said
that
the
testator
went
away
leaving
his
affairs
to
take
care
of
themselves
now
gentlemen
i
ask
you
if
this
can
fairly
be
said
of
a
man
whose
affairs
are
as
they
have
been
for
many
years
in
the
hands
of
a
highly
capable
completely
trustworthy
agent
who
is
better
acquainted
with
them
than
the
testator
himself
clearly
it
can
not
to
conclude
this
part
of
the
argument
i
submit
that
the
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
of
the
testator
present
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
the
testator
is
a
man
of
ample
means
without
any
responsibilities
to
fetter
his
movements
and
has
been
in
the
constant
habit
of
traveling
often
into
remote
and
distant
regions
the
mere
fact
that
he
has
been
absent
somewhat
longer
than
usual
affords
no
ground
whatever
for
the
drastic
proceeding
of
presumption
of
death
and
taking
possession
of
his
property
with
reference
to
the
human
remains
which
have
been
mentioned
in
connection
with
the
case
i
need
say
but
little
the
attempt
to
connect
them
with
the
testator
has
failed
completely
you
yourselves
have
heard
doctor
summers
state
on
oath
that
they
can
not
be
identified
as
the
remains
of
any
particular
person
that
would
seem
to
dispose
of
them
effectually
i
must
remark
upon
a
very
singular
point
that
has
been
raised
by
the
learned
counsel
for
the
petitioner
which
is
this
my
learned
friend
points
out
that
these
remains
were
discovered
near
eltham
and
near
woodford
and
that
the
testator
was
last
seen
alive
at
one
of
these
two
places
this
he
considers
for
some
reason
to
be
a
highly
significant
fact
but
i
can
not
agree
with
him
if
the
testator
had
been
last
seen
alive
at
woodford
and
the
remains
had
been
found
at
woodford
or
if
he
had
disappeared
from
eltham
and
the
remains
had
been
found
at
eltham
that
would
have
had
some
significance
but
he
can
only
have
been
last
seen
at
one
of
the
places
whereas
the
remains
have
been
found
at
both
places
here
again
my
learned
friend
seems
to
have
proved
too
much
but
i
need
not
occupy
your
time
further
i
repeat
that
in
order
to
justify
us
in
presuming
the
death
of
the
testator
clear
and
positive
evidence
would
be
necessary
that
no
such
evidence
has
been
brought
forward
accordingly
seeing
that
the
testator
may
return
at
any
time
and
is
entitled
to
find
his
property
intact
i
shall
ask
you
for
a
verdict
that
will
secure
to
him
this
measure
of
ordinary
justice
at
the
conclusion
of
heath
speech
the
judge
as
if
awakening
from
a
refreshing
nap
opened
his
eyes
and
uncommonly
shrewd
intelligent
eyes
they
were
when
the
expressive
eyelids
were
duly
tucked
up
out
of
the
way
he
commenced
by
reading
over
a
part
of
the
will
and
certain
notes
which
he
appeared
to
have
made
in
some
miraculous
fashion
with
his
eyes
shut
and
then
proceeded
to
review
the
evidence
and
the
counsels
arguments
for
the
instruction
of
the
jury
before
considering
the
evidence
which
you
have
heard
gentlemen
he
said
it
will
be
well
for
me
to
say
a
few
words
to
you
on
the
general
aspects
of
the
case
which
is
occupying
our
attention
if
a
person
goes
abroad
or
disappears
from
his
home
and
his
ordinary
places
of
resort
and
is
absent
for
a
long
period
of
time
the
presumption
of
death
arises
at
the
expiration
of
seven
years
from
the
date
on
which
he
was
last
heard
of
that
is
to
say
that
the
total
disappearance
of
an
individual
for
seven
years
constitutes
presumptive
evidence
that
the
said
individual
is
dead
and
the
presumption
can
be
set
aside
only
by
the
production
of
evidence
that
he
was
alive
at
some
time
within
that
period
of
seven
years
but
if
on
the
other
hand
it
is
sought
to
presume
the
death
of
a
person
who
has
been
absent
for
a
shorter
period
than
seven
years
it
is
necessary
to
produce
such
evidence
as
shall
make
it
highly
probable
that
the
said
person
is
dead
of
course
presumption
implies
supposition
as
opposed
to
actual
demonstration
but
nevertheless
the
evidence
in
such
a
case
must
be
of
a
kind
that
tends
to
create
a
very
strong
belief
that
death
has
occurred
and
i
need
hardly
say
that
the
shorter
the
period
of
absence
the
more
convincing
must
be
the
evidence
in
the
present
case
the
testator
john
bellingham
has
been
absent
somewhat
under
two
years
this
is
a
relatively
short
period
and
in
itself
gives
rise
to
no
presumption
of
death
nevertheless
death
has
been
presumed
in
a
case
where
the
period
of
absence
was
even
shorter
and
the
insurance
recovered
but
here
the
evidence
supporting
the
belief
in
the
occurrence
of
death
was
exceedingly
weighty
the
testator
in
this
case
was
a
shipmaster
and
his
disappearance
was
accompanied
by
the
disappearance
of
the
ship
and
the
entire
company
in
the
course
of
a
voyage
from
london
to
marseilles
the
loss
of
the
ship
and
her
crew
was
the
only
reasonable
explanation
of
the
disappearance
and
short
of
actual
demonstration
the
facts
offered
convincing
evidence
of
the
death
of
all
persons
on
board
i
mention
this
case
as
an
illustration
you
are
not
dealing
with
speculative
probabilities
you
are
contemplating
a
very
momentous
proceeding
and
you
must
be
very
sure
of
your
ground
consider
what
it
is
that
you
are
asked
to
do
the
petitioner
asks
permission
to
presume
the
death
of
the
testator
in
order
that
the
testator
property
may
be
distributed
among
the
beneficiaries
under
the
will
the
granting
of
such
permission
involves
us
in
the
gravest
responsibility
an
decision
might
be
productive
of
a
serious
injustice
to
the
testator
an
injustice
that
could
never
be
remedied
hence
it
is
incumbent
upon
you
to
weigh
the
evidence
with
the
greatest
care
to
come
to
no
decision
without
the
profoundest
consideration
of
all
the
facts
the
evidence
that
you
have
heard
divides
itself
into
two
parts
that
relating
to
the
circumstances
of
the
testator
disappearance
and
that
relating
to
certain
human
remains
in
connection
with
the
latter
i
can
only
express
my
surprise
and
regret
that
the
application
was
not
postponed
until
the
completion
of
the
coroner
inquest
and
leave
you
to
consider
the
evidence
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
doctor
summers
has
stated
explicitly
that
the
remains
can
not
be
identified
as
those
of
any
particular
individual
but
that
the
testator
and
the
unknown
deceased
had
so
many
points
of
resemblance
that
they
might
possibly
be
one
and
the
same
person
with
reference
to
the
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
you
have
heard
the
evidence
of
jellicoe
to
the
effect
that
the
testator
has
on
no
previous
occasion
gone
abroad
without
informing
him
as
to
his
proposed
destination
but
in
considering
what
weight
you
are
to
give
to
this
statement
you
will
bear
in
mind
that
when
the
testator
set
out
for
paris
after
his
interview
with
doctor
norbury
he
left
jellicoe
without
any
information
as
to
his
specific
destination
his
address
in
paris
or
the
precise
date
when
he
should
return
and
that
jellicoe
was
unable
to
tell
us
where
the
testator
went
or
what
was
his
business
jellicoe
was
in
fact
for
a
time
without
any
means
of
tracing
the
testator
or
ascertaining
his
whereabouts
the
evidence
of
the
housemaid
dobbs
and
of
hurst
is
rather
confusing
it
appears
that
the
testator
came
to
the
house
and
when
looked
for
later
was
not
to
be
found
a
search
of
the
premises
showed
that
he
was
not
in
the
house
whence
it
seems
to
follow
that
he
must
have
left
it
but
since
no
one
was
informed
of
his
intention
to
leave
and
he
had
expressed
the
intention
of
staying
to
see
hurst
his
conduct
in
thus
going
away
surreptitiously
must
appear
somewhat
eccentric
the
point
that
you
have
to
consider
therefore
is
whether
a
person
who
is
capable
of
thus
departing
in
a
surreptitious
and
eccentric
manner
from
a
house
without
giving
notice
to
the
servants
is
capable
also
of
departing
in
a
surreptitious
and
eccentric
manner
from
his
usual
places
of
resort
without
giving
notice
to
his
friends
or
thereafter
informing
them
of
his
whereabouts
the
questions
then
gentlemen
that
you
have
to
ask
yourselves
before
deciding
on
your
verdict
are
two
first
are
the
circumstances
of
the
testator
disappearance
and
his
continued
absence
incongruous
with
his
habits
and
personal
peculiarities
as
they
are
known
to
you
and
second
are
there
any
facts
which
indicate
in
a
positive
manner
that
the
testator
is
dead
ask
yourselves
these
questions
gentlemen
and
the
answers
to
them
furnished
by
the
evidence
that
you
have
heard
will
guide
you
to
your
decision
having
delivered
himself
of
the
above
instructions
the
judge
applied
himself
to
the
perusal
of
the
will
with
professional
gusto
in
which
occupation
he
was
presently
disturbed
by
the
announcement
of
the
foreman
of
the
jury
that
a
verdict
had
been
agreed
upon
the
judge
sat
up
and
glanced
at
the
and
when
the
foreman
proceeded
to
state
that
we
find
no
sufficient
reason
for
presuming
the
testator
john
bellingham
to
be
dead
he
nodded
approvingly
evidently
that
was
his
opinion
too
as
he
was
careful
to
explain
when
he
conveyed
to
loram
the
refusal
of
the
court
to
grant
the
permission
applied
for
the
decision
was
a
great
relief
to
me
and
also
i
think
to
miss
bellingham
but
most
of
all
to
her
father
who
with
instinctive
good
manners
since
he
could
not
suppress
a
smile
of
triumph
rose
and
hastily
stumped
out
of
the
court
so
that
the
discomfited
hurst
should
not
see
him
his
daughter
and
i
followed
and
as
we
left
the
court
she
remarked
with
a
smile
so
our
pauperism
is
not
after
all
made
absolute
there
is
still
a
chance
for
us
in
the
chapter
of
accidents
and
perhaps
even
for
poor
old
uncle
john
chapter
xv
circumstantial
evidence
the
morning
after
the
hearing
saw
me
setting
forth
on
my
round
in
more
than
usually
good
spirits
the
round
itself
was
but
a
short
one
for
my
list
contained
only
a
couple
of
chronics
and
this
perhaps
contributed
to
my
cheerful
outlook
on
life
but
there
were
other
reasons
the
decision
of
the
court
had
come
as
an
unexpected
reprieve
and
the
ruin
of
my
friends
prospects
was
at
least
postponed
then
i
had
learned
that
thorndyke
was
back
from
bristol
and
wished
me
to
look
in
on
him
and
finally
miss
bellingham
had
agreed
to
spend
this
very
afternoon
with
me
browsing
round
the
galleries
at
the
british
museum
i
had
disposed
of
my
two
patients
by
a
quarter
to
eleven
and
three
minutes
later
was
striding
down
mitre
court
all
agog
to
hear
what
thorndyke
had
to
say
with
reference
to
my
notes
on
the
inquest
the
oak
was
open
when
i
arrived
at
his
chambers
and
a
modest
flourish
on
the
little
brass
knocker
of
the
inner
door
was
answered
by
my
quondam
teacher
himself
how
good
of
you
berkeley
he
said
shaking
hands
genially
to
look
me
up
so
early
i
am
alone
just
looking
through
the
report
of
the
evidence
of
yesterday
proceedings
he
placed
an
easy
chair
for
me
and
gathering
up
a
bundle
of
typewritten
papers
laid
them
aside
on
the
table
were
you
surprised
at
the
decision
i
asked
no
he
answered
two
years
is
a
short
period
of
absence
but
still
it
might
easily
have
gone
the
other
way
i
am
greatly
relieved
the
respite
gives
us
time
to
carry
out
our
investigations
without
undue
hurry
did
you
find
my
notes
of
any
use
i
asked
heath
did
polton
handed
them
to
him
and
they
were
invaluable
to
him
for
his
i
have
seen
them
yet
in
fact
i
have
only
just
got
them
back
from
him
let
us
go
through
them
together
now
he
opened
a
drawer
and
taking
from
it
my
notebook
seated
himself
and
began
to
read
through
my
notes
with
grave
attention
while
i
stood
and
looked
shyly
over
his
shoulder
on
the
page
that
contained
my
sketches
of
the
sidcup
arm
showing
the
distribution
of
the
snails
eggs
on
the
bones
he
lingered
with
a
faint
smile
that
made
me
turn
hot
and
red
those
sketches
look
rather
footy
i
said
but
i
had
to
put
something
in
my
notebook
you
did
not
attach
any
importance
then
to
the
facts
that
they
illustrated
no
the
were
there
so
i
noted
the
fact
that
all
i
congratulate
you
berkeley
there
is
not
one
man
in
twenty
who
would
have
had
the
sense
to
make
a
careful
note
of
what
he
considers
an
unimportant
or
irrelevant
fact
and
the
investigator
who
notes
only
those
things
that
appear
significant
is
perfectly
useless
he
gives
himself
no
material
for
reconsideration
but
you
do
mean
that
these
and
appeared
to
you
to
have
no
significance
at
all
oh
of
course
they
show
the
position
in
which
the
bones
were
lying
exactly
the
arm
was
lying
fully
extended
with
the
dorsal
side
uppermost
but
we
also
learn
from
these
that
the
hand
had
been
separated
from
the
arm
before
it
was
thrown
into
the
pond
and
there
is
something
very
remarkable
in
that
i
leaned
over
his
shoulder
and
gazed
at
my
sketches
amazed
at
the
rapidity
with
which
he
had
reconstructed
the
limb
from
my
rough
drawings
of
the
individual
bones
i
do
quite
see
how
you
arrived
at
it
though
i
said
well
look
at
your
drawings
the
are
on
the
dorsal
surface
of
the
scapula
the
humerus
and
the
bones
of
the
but
here
you
have
shown
six
of
the
bones
of
the
hand
two
metacarpals
the
os
magnum
and
three
phalanges
and
they
all
have
on
the
palmar
surface
therefore
the
hand
was
lying
palm
upward
but
the
hand
may
have
been
pronated
if
you
mean
pronated
in
relation
to
the
arm
that
is
impossible
for
the
position
of
the
shows
clearly
that
the
bones
of
the
arm
were
lying
in
the
position
of
supination
thus
the
dorsal
surface
of
the
arm
and
the
palmar
surface
of
the
hand
respectively
were
uppermost
which
is
an
anatomical
impossibility
so
long
as
the
hand
is
attached
to
the
arm
but
might
not
the
hand
have
become
detached
after
lying
in
the
pond
for
some
time
no
it
could
not
have
been
detached
until
the
ligaments
had
decayed
and
if
it
had
been
separated
after
the
decay
of
the
soft
parts
the
bones
would
have
been
thrown
into
disorder
but
the
are
all
on
the
palmar
surface
showing
that
the
bones
were
still
in
their
normal
relative
positions
no
berkeley
that
hand
was
thrown
into
the
pond
separately
from
the
arm
but
why
should
it
have
been
i
asked
ah
there
is
a
very
pretty
little
problem
for
you
to
consider
and
meantime
let
me
tell
you
that
your
expedition
has
been
a
brilliant
success
you
are
an
excellent
observer
your
only
fault
is
that
when
you
have
noted
certain
facts
you
do
seem
fully
to
appreciate
their
significance
which
is
merely
a
matter
of
inexperience
as
to
the
facts
that
you
have
collected
several
of
them
are
of
prime
importance
i
am
glad
you
are
satisfied
said
i
though
i
do
see
that
i
have
discovered
much
excepting
those
snail
eggs
and
they
do
seem
to
have
advanced
matters
very
much
a
definite
fact
berkeley
is
a
definite
asset
perhaps
we
may
presently
find
a
little
space
in
our
chinese
puzzle
which
this
fact
of
the
detached
hand
will
just
drop
into
but
tell
me
did
you
find
nothing
unexpected
or
suggestive
about
those
bones
as
to
their
number
and
condition
for
instance
well
i
thought
it
a
little
queer
that
the
scapula
and
clavicle
should
be
there
i
should
have
expected
him
to
cut
the
arm
off
at
the
yes
said
thorndyke
so
should
i
and
so
it
has
been
done
in
every
case
of
dismemberment
that
i
am
acquainted
with
to
an
ordinary
person
the
arm
seems
to
join
on
to
the
trunk
at
the
and
that
is
where
he
would
naturally
sever
it
what
explanation
do
you
suggest
of
this
unusual
mode
of
severing
the
arm
do
you
think
the
fellow
could
have
been
a
butcher
i
asked
remembering
summers
remark
this
is
the
way
a
shoulder
of
mutton
is
taken
off
no
replied
thorndyke
a
butcher
includes
the
scapula
in
a
shoulder
of
mutton
for
a
specific
purpose
namely
to
take
off
a
given
quantity
of
meat
and
also
as
a
sheep
has
no
clavicle
it
is
the
easiest
way
to
detach
the
limb
but
i
imagine
a
butcher
would
find
himself
in
difficulties
if
he
attempted
to
take
off
a
man
arm
in
that
way
the
clavicle
would
be
a
new
and
perplexing
feature
then
too
a
butcher
does
not
deal
very
delicately
with
his
subject
if
he
has
to
divide
a
joint
he
just
cuts
through
it
and
does
not
trouble
himself
to
avoid
marking
the
bones
but
you
note
here
that
there
is
not
a
single
scratch
or
score
on
any
one
of
the
bones
not
even
where
the
finger
was
removed
now
if
you
have
ever
prepared
bones
for
a
museum
as
i
have
you
will
remember
the
extreme
care
that
is
necessary
in
disarticulating
joints
to
avoid
disfiguring
the
articular
ends
of
the
bones
with
cuts
and
scratches
then
you
think
that
the
person
who
dismembered
this
body
must
have
had
some
anatomical
knowledge
and
skill
that
is
what
has
been
suggested
the
suggestion
is
not
mine
then
i
infer
that
you
do
agree
thorndyke
smiled
i
am
sorry
to
be
so
cryptic
berkeley
but
you
understand
that
i
ca
make
statements
still
i
am
trying
to
lead
you
to
make
certain
inferences
from
the
facts
that
are
in
your
possession
if
i
make
the
right
inference
will
you
tell
me
i
asked
it
wo
be
necessary
he
answered
with
the
same
quiet
smile
when
you
have
fitted
the
puzzle
together
you
do
need
to
be
told
you
have
done
it
it
was
most
infernally
tantalizing
i
pondered
on
the
problem
with
a
scowl
of
such
intense
cogitation
that
thorndyke
laughed
outright
it
seems
to
me
i
said
at
length
that
the
identity
of
the
remains
is
the
primary
question
and
that
it
is
a
question
of
fact
it
seem
any
use
to
speculate
about
it
exactly
either
these
bones
are
the
remains
of
john
bellingham
or
they
are
not
there
will
be
no
doubt
on
the
subject
when
all
the
bones
are
assembled
if
ever
they
are
and
the
settlement
of
that
question
will
probably
throw
light
on
the
further
question
who
deposited
them
in
the
places
in
which
they
were
found
but
to
return
to
your
observations
did
you
gather
nothing
from
the
other
bones
from
the
complete
state
of
the
neck
vertebrae
for
instance
well
it
did
strike
me
as
rather
odd
that
the
fellow
should
have
gone
to
the
trouble
of
separating
the
atlas
from
the
skull
he
must
have
been
pretty
handy
with
the
scalpel
to
have
done
it
as
cleanly
as
he
seems
to
have
done
but
i
do
see
why
he
should
have
gone
about
the
business
in
the
most
inconvenient
way
you
notice
the
uniformity
of
method
he
has
separated
the
head
from
the
spine
instead
of
cutting
through
the
spine
lower
down
as
most
persons
would
have
done
he
removed
the
arms
with
the
entire
instead
of
simply
cutting
them
off
at
the
even
in
the
thighs
the
same
peculiarity
appears
for
in
neither
case
was
the
found
with
the
although
it
seems
to
have
been
searched
for
now
the
obvious
way
to
divide
the
leg
is
to
cut
through
the
patellar
ligament
leaving
the
attached
to
the
thigh
but
in
this
case
the
appears
to
have
been
left
attached
to
the
shank
can
you
explain
why
this
person
should
have
adopted
this
unusual
and
rather
inconvenient
method
can
you
suggest
a
motive
for
this
procedure
or
can
you
think
of
any
circumstances
which
might
lead
a
person
to
adopt
this
method
by
preference
it
seems
as
if
he
wished
for
some
reason
to
divide
the
body
into
definite
anatomical
regions
thorndyke
chuckled
you
are
not
offering
that
suggestion
as
an
explanation
are
you
because
it
would
require
more
explaining
than
the
original
problem
and
it
is
not
even
true
anatomically
speaking
the
appertains
to
the
thigh
rather
than
to
the
shank
it
is
a
sesamoid
bone
belonging
to
the
thigh
muscles
yet
in
this
case
it
has
been
left
attached
apparently
to
the
shank
no
berkeley
that
cat
wo
jump
our
unknown
operator
was
not
preparing
a
skeleton
as
a
museum
specimen
he
was
dividing
a
body
up
into
convenient
sized
portions
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
them
to
various
ponds
now
what
circumstances
might
have
led
him
to
divide
it
in
this
peculiar
manner
i
am
afraid
i
have
no
suggestion
to
offer
have
you
thorndyke
suddenly
lapsed
into
ambiguity
i
think
he
said
it
is
possible
to
conceive
such
circumstances
and
so
probably
will
you
if
you
think
it
over
did
you
gather
anything
of
importance
from
the
evidence
at
the
inquest
i
asked
it
is
difficult
to
say
he
replied
the
whole
of
my
conclusions
in
this
case
are
based
on
what
is
virtually
circumstantial
evidence
i
have
not
one
single
fact
of
which
i
can
say
that
it
admits
only
of
a
single
interpretation
still
it
must
be
remembered
that
even
the
most
inconclusive
facts
if
sufficiently
multiplied
yield
a
highly
conclusive
total
and
my
little
pile
of
evidence
is
growing
particle
by
particle
but
we
must
sit
here
gossiping
at
this
hour
of
the
day
i
have
to
consult
with
marchmont
and
you
say
that
you
have
an
early
afternoon
engagement
we
can
walk
together
as
far
as
fleet
street
a
minute
or
two
later
we
went
our
respective
ways
thorndyke
toward
lombard
street
and
i
to
fetter
lane
not
unmindful
of
those
coming
events
that
were
casting
so
agreeable
a
shadow
before
them
there
was
only
one
message
awaiting
me
and
when
adolphus
had
delivered
it
amidst
mephitic
fumes
that
rose
from
the
basement
premonitory
of
fried
plaice
i
pocketed
my
stethoscope
and
betook
myself
to
gunpowder
alley
the
aristocratic
abode
of
my
patient
joyfully
threading
the
now
familiar
passages
of
gough
square
and
wine
office
court
and
meditating
pleasantly
on
the
curious
literary
flavor
that
pervades
these
regions
for
the
shade
of
the
author
of
still
seems
to
haunt
the
scenes
of
his
titanic
labors
and
his
ponderous
but
homely
and
temperate
rejoicings
every
court
and
alley
whispers
of
books
and
of
the
making
of
books
forms
of
type
trundled
noisily
on
trolleys
by
boys
salute
the
wayfarer
at
odd
corners
piles
of
strawboard
rolls
or
bales
of
paper
drums
of
or
roller
composition
stand
on
the
pavement
outside
dark
entries
basement
windows
give
glimpses
into
hadean
caverns
tenanted
by
legions
of
printer
devils
and
the
very
air
is
charged
with
the
hum
of
press
and
with
odors
of
glue
and
paste
and
oil
the
entire
neighborhood
is
given
up
to
the
printer
and
binder
and
even
my
patient
turned
out
to
be
a
grinder
a
ferocious
and
revolutionary
calling
strangely
at
variance
with
his
harmless
appearance
and
meek
bearing
i
was
in
good
time
at
my
tryst
despite
the
hindrances
of
fried
plaice
and
invalid
guillotinists
but
early
as
i
was
miss
bellingham
was
already
waiting
in
the
garden
she
had
been
filling
a
bowl
with
flowers
ready
to
sally
forth
it
is
quite
like
old
times
she
said
as
we
turned
into
fetter
lane
to
be
going
to
the
museum
together
it
brings
back
the
tablets
and
all
your
kindness
and
unselfish
labor
i
suppose
we
shall
walk
there
certainly
i
replied
i
am
not
going
to
share
your
society
with
the
common
mortals
who
ride
in
omnibuses
that
would
be
sheer
sinful
waste
besides
it
is
more
companionable
to
walk
yes
it
is
and
the
bustle
of
the
streets
makes
one
more
appreciative
of
the
quiet
of
the
museum
what
are
we
going
to
look
at
when
we
get
there
you
must
decide
that
i
replied
you
know
the
collection
much
better
than
i
do
well
now
she
mused
i
wonder
what
you
would
like
to
see
or
in
other
words
what
i
should
like
you
to
see
the
old
english
pottery
is
rather
fascinating
especially
the
fulham
ware
i
rather
think
i
shall
take
you
to
see
that
she
reflected
a
while
and
then
just
as
we
reached
the
gate
of
staple
inn
she
stopped
and
looked
thoughtfully
down
the
gray
inn
road
you
have
taken
a
great
interest
in
our
as
doctor
thorndyke
calls
it
would
you
like
to
see
the
churchyard
where
uncle
john
wished
to
be
buried
it
is
a
little
out
of
our
way
but
we
are
not
in
a
hurry
are
we
i
certainly
was
not
any
deviation
that
might
prolong
our
walk
was
welcome
and
as
to
the
place
why
all
places
were
alike
to
me
if
only
she
were
by
my
side
besides
the
churchyard
was
really
of
some
interest
since
it
was
undoubtedly
the
exciting
cause
of
the
obnoxious
paragraph
two
of
the
will
i
accordingly
expressed
a
desire
to
make
its
acquaintance
and
we
crossed
to
the
entrance
to
gray
inn
road
do
you
ever
try
she
asked
as
we
turned
down
the
dingy
thoroughfare
to
picture
familiar
places
as
they
looked
a
couple
of
hundred
years
ago
yes
i
answered
and
very
difficult
i
find
it
one
has
to
manufacture
the
materials
for
reconstruction
and
then
the
present
aspect
of
the
place
will
keep
obtruding
itself
but
some
places
are
easier
to
reconstitute
than
others
that
is
what
i
find
said
she
now
holborn
for
example
is
quite
easy
to
reconstruct
though
i
daresay
the
imaginary
form
is
a
bit
like
the
original
but
there
are
fragments
left
like
staple
inn
and
the
front
of
gray
inn
and
then
one
has
seen
prints
of
the
old
middle
row
and
some
of
the
taverns
so
that
one
has
some
material
with
which
to
help
out
one
imagination
but
this
road
we
are
walking
in
always
baffles
me
it
looks
so
old
and
yet
is
for
the
most
part
so
new
that
i
find
it
impossible
to
make
a
satisfactory
picture
of
its
appearance
say
when
sir
roger
de
coverley
might
have
strolled
in
gray
inn
walks
or
farther
back
when
francis
bacon
had
chambers
in
the
inn
i
imagine
said
i
that
part
of
the
difficulty
is
in
the
mixed
character
of
the
neighborhood
here
on
the
one
side
is
old
inn
not
much
changed
since
bacon
time
his
chambers
are
still
to
be
seen
i
think
over
the
gateway
and
there
on
the
clerkenwell
side
is
a
dense
and
rather
squalid
neighborhood
which
has
grown
up
over
a
region
partly
rural
and
wholly
fugitive
in
character
places
like
bagnigge
wells
and
hockley
in
the
hole
would
not
have
had
many
buildings
that
were
likely
to
survive
and
in
the
absence
of
surviving
specimens
the
imagination
has
much
to
work
from
i
daresay
you
are
right
said
she
certainly
the
purlieus
of
old
clerkenwell
present
a
very
confused
picture
to
me
whereas
in
the
case
of
an
old
street
like
say
great
ormond
street
one
has
only
to
sweep
away
the
modern
buildings
and
replace
them
with
glorious
old
houses
like
the
few
that
remain
dig
up
the
roadway
and
pavements
and
lay
down
plant
a
few
wooden
posts
hang
up
one
or
two
and
the
transformation
is
complete
and
a
very
delightful
transformation
it
is
very
delightful
which
by
the
way
is
a
melancholy
thought
for
we
ought
to
be
doing
better
work
than
our
forefathers
whereas
what
we
actually
do
is
to
pull
down
the
old
buildings
clap
the
doorways
porticoes
paneling
and
mantels
in
our
museums
and
then
run
up
something
inexpensive
and
useful
and
deadly
uninteresting
in
their
place
my
companion
looked
at
me
and
laughed
softly
for
a
naturally
cheerful
and
even
gay
young
man
said
she
you
are
most
amazingly
pessimistic
the
mantle
of
jeremiah
if
he
ever
wore
one
seems
to
have
fallen
on
you
but
without
in
the
least
impairing
your
good
spirits
excepting
in
regard
to
matters
architectural
i
have
much
to
be
thankful
for
said
i
am
i
not
taken
to
the
museum
by
a
fair
lady
and
does
she
not
stay
me
with
mummy
cases
and
comfort
me
with
crockery
pottery
she
corrected
and
then
as
we
met
a
party
of
women
emerging
from
a
she
said
i
suppose
those
are
lady
medical
students
yes
on
their
way
to
the
royal
free
hospital
note
the
gravity
of
their
demeanor
and
contrast
it
with
the
levity
of
the
male
student
i
was
doing
so
she
answered
and
wondering
why
professional
women
are
usually
so
much
more
serious
than
men
perhaps
i
suggested
it
is
a
matter
of
selection
a
peculiar
type
of
woman
is
attracted
to
the
professions
whereas
every
man
has
to
earn
his
living
as
a
matter
of
course
yes
i
daresay
that
is
the
explanation
this
is
our
turning
we
passed
into
heathcote
street
at
the
end
of
which
was
an
open
gate
giving
entrance
to
one
of
those
disused
and
metamorphosed
that
are
to
be
met
with
in
the
older
districts
of
london
in
which
the
dispossessed
dead
are
jostled
into
corners
to
make
room
for
the
living
many
of
the
headstones
were
still
standing
and
others
displaced
to
make
room
for
asphalted
walks
and
seats
were
ranged
around
by
the
walls
exhibiting
inscriptions
made
meaningless
by
their
removal
it
was
a
pleasant
enough
place
on
this
summer
afternoon
contrasted
with
the
dingy
streets
whence
we
had
come
though
its
grass
was
faded
and
yellow
and
the
twitter
of
the
birds
in
the
trees
mingled
with
the
hideous
drawls
of
the
children
who
played
around
the
seats
and
the
few
remaining
tombs
so
this
is
the
last
of
the
illustrious
house
of
bellingham
said
i
yes
and
we
are
not
the
only
distinguished
people
who
repose
in
this
place
the
daughter
of
no
less
a
person
than
richard
cromwell
is
buried
here
the
tomb
is
still
standing
but
perhaps
you
have
been
here
before
and
know
it
i
do
think
i
have
ever
been
here
before
and
yet
there
is
something
about
the
place
that
seems
familiar
i
looked
around
cudgeling
my
brains
for
the
key
to
the
dimly
reminiscent
sensations
that
the
place
evoked
until
suddenly
i
caught
sight
of
a
group
of
buildings
away
to
the
west
enclosed
within
a
wall
heightened
by
a
wooden
trellis
yes
of
course
i
exclaimed
i
remember
the
place
now
i
have
never
been
in
this
part
before
but
in
that
enclosure
beyond
which
opens
at
the
end
of
henrietta
street
there
used
to
be
and
may
be
still
for
all
i
know
a
school
of
anatomy
at
which
i
attended
in
my
first
year
in
fact
i
did
my
first
dissection
there
there
was
a
certain
gruesome
appropriateness
in
the
position
of
the
school
remarked
miss
bellingham
it
would
have
been
really
convenient
in
the
days
of
the
resurrection
men
your
material
would
have
been
delivered
at
your
very
door
was
it
a
large
school
the
attendance
varied
according
to
the
time
of
the
year
sometimes
i
worked
there
quite
alone
i
used
to
let
myself
in
with
a
key
and
hoist
my
subject
out
of
a
sort
of
sepulchral
tank
by
means
of
a
chain
tackle
it
was
a
ghoulish
business
you
have
no
idea
how
awful
the
body
used
to
look
to
my
unaccustomed
eyes
as
it
rose
slowly
out
of
the
tank
it
was
like
the
resurrection
scene
that
you
see
on
some
old
tombstones
where
the
deceased
is
shown
rising
out
of
his
coffin
while
the
skeleton
death
falls
vanquished
with
his
dart
shattered
and
his
crown
toppling
off
i
remember
too
that
the
demonstrator
used
to
wear
a
blue
apron
which
created
a
sort
of
impression
of
a
cannibal
butcher
shop
but
i
am
afraid
i
am
shocking
you
no
you
are
not
every
profession
has
its
unpresentable
aspects
which
ought
not
to
be
seen
by
outsiders
think
of
the
sculptor
studio
and
of
the
sculptor
himself
when
he
is
modeling
a
large
figure
or
a
group
in
clay
he
might
be
a
bricklayer
or
a
roadsweeper
if
you
judge
by
his
appearance
this
is
the
tomb
i
was
telling
you
about
we
halted
before
the
plain
coffer
of
stone
weathered
and
wasted
by
age
but
yet
kept
in
decent
repair
by
some
pious
hands
and
read
the
inscription
setting
forth
with
modest
pride
that
here
reposed
anna
sixth
daughter
of
richard
cromwell
the
protector
it
was
a
simple
monument
and
commonplace
enough
with
the
crude
severity
of
the
ascetic
age
to
which
it
belonged
but
still
it
carried
the
mind
back
to
those
stirring
times
when
the
leafy
shades
of
gray
inn
lane
must
have
resounded
with
the
clank
of
weapons
and
the
tramp
of
armed
men
when
this
bald
was
a
rustic
churchyard
standing
amidst
green
fields
and
hedgerows
and
countrymen
leading
their
into
london
through
the
lane
would
stop
to
look
in
over
the
wooden
gate
miss
bellingham
looked
at
me
critically
as
i
stood
thus
reflecting
and
presently
remarked
i
think
you
and
i
have
a
good
many
mental
habits
in
common
i
looked
up
inquiringly
and
she
continued
i
notice
that
an
old
tombstone
seems
to
set
you
meditating
so
it
does
me
when
i
look
at
an
ancient
monument
and
especially
an
old
headstone
i
find
myself
almost
unconsciously
retracing
the
years
to
the
date
that
is
written
on
the
stone
why
do
you
think
that
is
why
should
a
monument
be
so
stimulating
to
the
imagination
and
why
should
a
common
headstone
be
more
so
than
any
other
i
suppose
it
is
i
answered
reflectively
that
a
churchyard
monument
is
a
peculiarly
personal
thing
and
appertains
in
a
peculiar
way
to
a
particular
time
and
the
circumstance
that
it
has
stood
untouched
by
the
passing
years
while
everything
around
has
changed
helps
the
imagination
to
span
the
interval
and
the
common
headstone
the
memorial
of
some
dead
and
gone
farmer
or
laborer
who
lived
and
died
in
the
village
hard
by
is
still
more
intimate
and
suggestive
the
rustic
childish
sculpture
of
the
village
mason
and
the
artless
doggerel
of
the
village
schoolmaster
bring
back
the
time
and
place
and
the
conditions
of
life
more
vividly
than
the
more
scholarly
inscriptions
and
the
more
artistic
enrichments
of
monuments
of
greater
pretensions
but
where
are
your
own
family
tombstones
they
are
over
in
that
farther
corner
there
is
an
intelligent
but
inopportune
person
apparently
copying
the
epitaphs
i
wish
he
would
go
away
i
want
to
show
them
to
you
i
now
noticed
for
the
first
time
an
individual
engaged
notebook
in
hand
in
making
a
careful
survey
of
a
group
of
old
headstones
evidently
he
was
making
a
copy
of
the
inscriptions
for
not
only
was
he
poring
attentively
over
the
writing
on
the
face
of
the
stone
but
now
and
again
he
helped
out
his
vision
by
running
his
fingers
over
the
worn
lettering
that
is
my
grandfather
tombstone
that
he
is
copying
now
said
miss
bellingham
and
even
as
she
spoke
the
man
turned
and
directed
a
searching
glance
at
us
with
a
pair
of
keen
spectacled
eyes
simultaneously
we
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
for
the
investigator
was
jellicoe
chapter
xvi
o
artemidorus
farewell
whether
or
not
jellicoe
was
surprised
to
see
us
it
is
impossible
to
say
his
countenance
which
served
the
ordinary
purposes
of
a
face
inasmuch
as
it
contained
the
principal
organs
of
special
sense
with
inlets
to
the
alimentary
and
respiratory
tracts
was
as
an
apparatus
for
the
expression
of
the
emotions
a
total
failure
to
a
it
would
have
been
about
as
helpful
as
the
face
carved
upon
the
handle
of
an
umbrella
a
comparison
suggested
perhaps
by
a
certain
resemblance
to
such
an
object
he
advanced
holding
open
his
notebook
and
pencil
and
having
saluted
us
with
a
stiff
bow
and
an
flourish
of
his
hat
shook
hands
rheumatically
and
waited
for
us
to
speak
this
is
an
unexpected
pleasure
jellicoe
said
miss
bellingham
it
is
very
good
of
you
to
say
so
he
replied
and
quite
a
coincidence
that
we
should
all
happen
to
come
here
on
the
same
day
a
coincidence
certainly
he
admitted
and
if
we
had
all
happened
not
to
come
which
must
have
occurred
frequently
that
also
would
have
been
a
coincidence
i
suppose
it
would
said
she
but
i
hope
we
are
not
interrupting
you
thank
you
no
i
had
just
finished
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
perceiving
you
you
were
making
some
notes
in
reference
to
the
case
i
imagine
said
i
it
was
an
impertinent
question
put
with
malice
aforethought
for
the
mere
pleasure
of
hearing
him
evade
it
the
case
he
repeated
you
are
referring
perhaps
to
stevens
versus
the
parish
council
i
think
doctor
berkeley
was
referring
to
the
case
of
my
uncle
will
miss
bellingham
said
quite
gravely
though
with
a
suspicious
dimpling
about
the
corners
of
her
mouth
indeed
said
jellicoe
there
is
a
case
is
there
a
suit
i
mean
the
proceedings
instituted
by
mr
hurst
oh
but
that
was
merely
an
application
to
the
court
and
is
moreover
finished
and
done
with
at
least
so
i
understand
i
speak
of
course
subject
to
correction
i
am
not
acting
for
hurst
you
will
be
pleased
to
remember
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
continued
after
a
brief
pause
i
was
just
refreshing
my
memory
as
to
the
wording
of
the
inscriptions
on
these
stones
especially
that
of
your
grandfather
francis
bellingham
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
if
it
should
appear
by
the
finding
of
the
coroner
jury
that
your
uncle
is
deceased
it
would
be
proper
and
decorous
that
some
memorial
should
be
placed
here
but
as
the
burial
ground
is
closed
there
might
be
some
difficulty
about
erecting
a
new
monument
whereas
there
would
probably
be
none
in
adding
an
inscription
to
one
already
existing
hence
these
investigations
for
if
the
inscriptions
on
your
grandfather
stone
had
set
forth
that
rests
the
body
of
francis
bellingham
it
would
have
been
manifestly
improper
to
add
that
of
john
bellingham
son
of
the
above
fortunately
the
inscription
was
more
discreetly
drafted
merely
recording
the
fact
that
this
monument
is
to
the
memory
of
the
said
francis
and
not
committing
itself
as
to
the
whereabouts
of
the
remains
but
perhaps
i
am
interrupting
you
no
not
at
all
replied
miss
bellingham
which
was
grossly
untrue
he
was
interrupting
most
intolerably
we
were
going
to
the
british
museum
and
just
looked
in
here
on
our
way
ha
said
jellicoe
now
i
happen
to
be
going
to
the
museum
too
to
see
doctor
norbury
i
suppose
that
is
another
coincidence
certainly
it
is
miss
bellingham
replied
and
then
she
asked
shall
we
walk
together
and
the
old
curmudgeon
actually
said
yes
confound
him
we
returned
to
the
gray
inn
road
where
as
there
was
now
room
for
us
to
walk
abreast
i
proceeded
to
indemnify
myself
for
the
unwelcome
company
by
leading
the
conversation
back
to
the
subject
of
the
missing
man
was
there
anything
jellicoe
in
john
bellingham
state
of
health
that
would
make
it
probable
that
he
might
die
suddenly
the
lawyer
looked
at
me
suspiciously
for
a
few
moments
and
then
remarked
you
seem
to
be
greatly
interested
in
john
bellingham
and
his
affairs
i
am
my
friends
are
deeply
concerned
in
them
and
the
case
itself
is
of
more
than
common
interest
from
a
professional
point
of
view
and
what
is
the
bearing
of
this
particular
question
surely
it
is
obvious
said
i
if
a
missing
man
is
known
to
have
suffered
from
some
affection
such
as
heart
disease
aneurism
or
arterial
degeneration
likely
to
produce
sudden
death
that
fact
will
surely
be
highly
material
to
the
question
as
to
whether
he
is
probably
dead
or
alive
no
doubt
you
are
right
said
jellicoe
i
have
little
knowledge
of
medical
affairs
but
doubtless
you
are
right
as
to
the
question
itself
i
am
bellingham
lawyer
not
his
doctor
his
health
is
a
matter
that
lies
outside
my
jurisdiction
but
you
heard
my
evidence
in
court
to
the
effect
that
the
testator
appeared
to
my
untutored
observation
to
be
a
healthy
man
i
can
say
no
more
now
if
the
question
is
of
any
importance
said
miss
bellingham
i
wonder
they
did
not
call
his
doctor
and
settle
it
definitely
my
own
impression
is
that
he
was
or
is
rather
a
strong
and
sound
man
he
certainly
recovered
very
quickly
and
completely
after
his
accident
what
accident
was
that
i
asked
oh
has
my
father
told
you
it
occurred
while
he
was
staying
with
us
he
slipped
from
a
curb
and
broke
one
of
the
bones
of
the
left
ankle
somebody
fracture
pott
yes
that
was
the
name
pott
fracture
and
he
broke
both
his
as
well
sir
morgan
bennett
had
to
perform
an
operation
or
he
would
have
been
a
cripple
for
life
as
it
was
he
was
about
again
in
a
few
weeks
apparently
none
the
worse
excepting
for
a
slight
weakness
of
the
left
ankle
could
he
walk
upstairs
i
asked
oh
yes
and
play
golf
and
ride
a
bicycle
you
are
sure
he
broke
both
quite
sure
i
remember
that
it
was
mentioned
as
an
uncommon
injury
and
that
sir
morgan
seemed
quite
pleased
with
him
for
doing
it
that
sounds
rather
libelous
but
i
expect
he
was
pleased
with
the
result
of
the
operation
he
might
well
be
here
there
was
a
brief
lull
in
the
conversation
and
even
as
i
was
trying
to
think
of
a
poser
for
jellicoe
that
gentleman
took
the
opportunity
to
change
the
subject
are
you
going
to
the
egyptian
rooms
he
asked
no
replied
miss
bellingham
we
are
going
to
look
at
the
pottery
ancient
or
modern
that
old
fulham
ware
is
what
chiefly
interests
us
at
present
that
of
the
seventeenth
century
i
do
know
whether
you
call
that
ancient
or
modern
neither
do
i
said
jellicoe
antiquity
and
modernity
are
terms
that
have
no
fixed
connotation
they
are
purely
relative
and
their
application
in
a
particular
instance
has
to
be
determined
by
a
sort
of
sliding
scale
to
a
furniture
collector
a
tudor
chair
or
a
jacobean
chest
is
ancient
to
an
architect
their
period
is
modern
whereas
an
church
is
ancient
but
to
an
egyptologist
accustomed
to
remains
of
a
vast
antiquity
both
are
products
of
modern
periods
separated
by
an
insignificant
interval
and
i
suppose
he
added
reflectively
that
to
a
geologist
the
traces
of
the
very
earliest
dawn
of
human
history
appertain
only
to
the
recent
period
conceptions
of
time
like
all
other
conceptions
are
relative
you
would
appear
to
be
a
disciple
of
herbert
spencer
i
remarked
i
am
a
disciple
of
arthur
jellicoe
sir
he
retorted
and
i
believed
him
by
the
time
we
had
reached
the
museum
he
had
become
almost
genial
and
if
less
amusing
in
this
frame
he
was
so
much
more
instructive
and
entertaining
that
i
refrained
from
baiting
him
and
permitted
him
to
discuss
his
favorite
topic
unhindered
especially
since
my
companion
listened
with
lively
interest
nor
when
we
entered
the
great
hall
did
he
relinquish
possession
of
us
and
we
followed
submissively
as
he
led
the
way
past
the
winged
bulls
of
nineveh
and
the
great
seated
statues
until
we
found
ourselves
almost
without
the
exercise
of
our
volition
in
the
upper
room
amidst
the
glaring
mummy
cases
that
had
witnessed
the
birth
of
my
friendship
with
ruth
bellingham
before
i
leave
you
said
jellicoe
i
should
like
to
show
you
that
mummy
that
we
were
discussing
the
other
evening
the
one
you
remember
that
my
friend
john
bellingham
presented
to
the
museum
a
little
time
before
his
disappearance
the
point
that
i
mentioned
is
only
a
trivial
one
but
it
may
become
of
interest
hereafter
if
any
plausible
explanation
should
be
forthcoming
he
led
us
along
the
room
until
we
arrived
at
the
case
containing
john
bellingham
gift
where
he
halted
and
gazed
in
at
the
mummy
with
the
affectionate
reflectiveness
of
the
connoisseur
the
bitumen
coating
was
what
we
were
discussing
miss
bellingham
said
he
you
have
seen
it
of
course
yes
she
answered
it
is
a
dreadful
disfigurement
is
it
esthetically
it
is
to
be
deplored
but
it
adds
a
certain
speculative
interest
to
the
specimen
you
notice
that
the
black
coating
leaves
the
principal
decoration
and
the
whole
of
the
inscription
untouched
which
is
precisely
the
part
that
one
would
expect
to
find
covered
up
whereas
the
feet
and
the
back
which
probably
bore
no
writing
are
quite
thickly
crusted
if
you
stoop
down
you
can
see
that
the
bitumen
was
daubed
freely
into
the
lacings
of
the
back
where
it
served
no
purpose
so
that
even
the
strings
are
embedded
he
stooped
as
he
spoke
and
peered
up
inquisitively
at
the
back
of
the
mummy
where
it
was
visible
between
the
supports
has
doctor
norbury
any
explanation
to
offer
asked
miss
bellingham
none
whatever
replied
jellicoe
he
finds
it
as
great
a
mystery
as
i
do
but
he
thinks
that
we
may
get
some
suggestion
from
the
director
when
he
comes
back
he
is
a
very
great
authority
as
you
know
and
a
practical
excavator
of
great
experience
too
but
i
stay
here
talking
of
these
things
and
keeping
you
from
your
pottery
perhaps
i
have
stayed
too
long
already
if
i
have
i
ask
your
pardon
and
i
will
now
wish
you
a
very
good
afternoon
with
a
sudden
return
to
his
customary
wooden
impassivity
he
shook
hands
with
us
bowed
stiffly
and
took
himself
off
toward
the
curator
office
what
a
strange
man
that
is
said
miss
bellingham
as
jellicoe
disappeared
through
the
doorway
at
the
end
of
the
room
or
perhaps
i
should
say
a
strange
being
for
i
can
hardly
think
of
him
as
a
man
i
have
never
met
any
other
human
creature
at
all
like
him
he
is
certainly
a
queer
old
fogey
i
agreed
yes
but
there
is
something
more
than
that
he
is
so
emotionless
so
remote
and
aloof
from
all
mundane
concerns
he
moves
among
ordinary
men
and
women
but
as
a
mere
presence
an
unmoved
spectator
of
their
actions
quite
dispassionate
and
impersonal
yes
he
is
astonishingly
in
fact
he
seems
as
you
say
to
go
to
and
fro
among
men
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
infernal
atmosphere
of
his
own
like
marley
ghost
but
he
is
lively
and
human
enough
as
soon
as
the
subject
of
egyptian
antiquities
is
broached
lively
but
not
human
he
is
always
to
me
quite
unhuman
even
when
he
is
most
interested
and
even
enthusiastic
he
is
a
mere
personification
of
knowledge
nature
ought
to
have
furnished
him
with
an
ibis
head
like
tahuti
then
he
would
have
looked
his
part
he
would
have
made
a
rare
sensation
in
lincoln
inn
if
he
had
said
i
and
we
both
laughed
heartily
at
the
imaginary
picture
of
tahuti
jellicoe
and
going
about
his
business
in
lincoln
inn
and
the
law
courts
insensibly
as
we
talked
we
had
drawn
near
to
the
mummy
of
artemidorus
and
now
my
companion
halted
before
the
case
with
her
thoughtful
gray
eyes
bent
dreamily
on
the
face
that
looked
out
at
us
i
watched
her
with
reverent
admiration
how
charming
she
looked
as
she
stood
with
her
sweet
grave
face
turned
so
earnestly
to
the
object
of
her
mystical
affection
how
dainty
and
full
of
womanly
dignity
and
grace
and
then
suddenly
it
was
borne
in
upon
me
that
a
great
change
had
come
over
her
since
the
day
of
our
first
meeting
she
had
grown
younger
more
girlish
and
more
gentle
at
first
she
had
seemed
much
older
than
i
a
woman
weary
solemn
enigmatic
almost
gloomy
with
a
bitter
ironic
humor
and
a
bearing
distant
and
cold
now
she
was
only
maidenly
and
sweet
tinged
it
is
true
with
a
certain
seriousness
but
frank
and
gracious
and
wholly
lovable
could
the
change
be
due
to
our
friendship
as
i
asked
myself
the
question
my
heart
leaped
with
a
new
hope
i
yearned
to
tell
her
all
that
she
was
to
me
all
that
i
hoped
we
might
be
to
one
another
in
the
years
to
come
at
length
i
ventured
to
break
in
upon
her
reverie
what
are
you
thinking
about
so
earnestly
fair
lady
she
turned
quickly
with
a
bright
smile
and
sparkling
eyes
that
looked
frankly
into
mine
i
was
wondering
said
she
if
he
was
jealous
of
my
new
friend
but
what
a
baby
i
am
to
talk
such
nonsense
she
laughed
softly
and
happily
with
just
an
adorable
hint
of
shyness
why
should
he
be
jealous
i
asked
well
you
see
before
we
were
friends
he
had
me
all
to
himself
i
have
never
had
a
man
friend
before
except
my
father
and
no
really
intimate
friend
at
all
and
i
was
very
lonely
in
those
days
after
our
troubles
had
befallen
i
am
naturally
solitary
but
still
i
am
only
a
girl
i
am
not
a
philosopher
so
when
i
felt
very
lonely
i
used
to
come
here
and
look
at
artemidorus
and
make
believe
that
he
knew
all
the
sadness
of
my
life
and
sympathized
with
me
it
was
very
silly
i
know
but
yet
somehow
it
was
a
real
comfort
to
me
it
was
not
silly
of
you
at
all
he
must
have
been
a
good
man
a
gentle
man
who
had
won
the
love
of
those
who
knew
him
as
this
beautiful
memorial
tells
and
it
was
wise
and
good
of
you
to
sweeten
the
bitterness
of
your
life
with
the
fragrance
of
this
human
love
that
blossoms
in
the
dust
after
the
lapse
of
centuries
no
you
were
not
silly
and
artemidorus
is
not
jealous
of
your
new
friend
are
you
sure
she
still
smiled
as
she
asked
the
question
but
her
glance
was
soft
almost
tender
and
there
was
a
note
of
whimsical
anxiety
in
her
voice
quite
sure
i
give
you
my
confident
assurance
she
laughed
gaily
then
said
she
i
am
satisfied
for
i
am
sure
you
know
but
here
is
a
mighty
telepathist
who
can
read
the
thoughts
even
of
a
mummy
a
most
formidable
companion
but
tell
me
how
you
know
i
know
because
it
is
he
who
gave
you
to
me
to
be
my
friend
do
you
remember
yes
i
remember
she
answered
softly
it
was
when
you
were
so
sympathetic
with
my
foolish
whim
that
i
felt
we
were
really
friends
and
i
when
you
confided
your
pretty
fancy
to
me
thanked
you
for
the
gift
of
your
friendship
and
treasured
it
and
do
still
treasure
it
above
everything
on
earth
she
looked
at
me
quickly
with
a
sort
of
nervousness
in
her
manner
and
cast
down
her
eyes
then
after
a
few
moments
almost
embarrassed
silence
as
if
to
bring
back
our
talk
to
a
less
emotional
plane
she
said
do
you
notice
the
curious
way
in
which
this
memorial
divides
itself
up
into
two
parts
how
do
you
mean
i
asked
a
little
disconcerted
by
the
sudden
descent
i
mean
that
there
is
a
part
of
it
that
is
purely
decorative
and
a
part
that
is
expressive
or
emotional
you
notice
that
the
general
design
and
scheme
of
decoration
although
really
greek
in
feeling
follows
rigidly
the
egyptian
conventions
but
the
portrait
is
entirely
in
the
greek
manner
and
when
they
came
to
that
pathetic
farewell
it
had
to
be
spoken
in
their
own
tongue
written
in
their
own
familiar
characters
yes
i
have
noticed
that
and
admired
the
taste
with
which
they
have
kept
the
inscription
so
inconspicuous
as
not
to
clash
with
the
decoration
an
obtrusive
inscription
in
greek
characters
would
have
spoiled
the
consistency
of
the
whole
scheme
yes
it
would
she
assented
absently
as
if
she
were
thinking
of
something
else
and
once
more
gazed
thoughtfully
at
the
mummy
i
watched
her
with
deep
content
noted
the
lovely
contour
of
her
cheek
the
soft
masses
of
hair
that
strayed
away
so
gracefully
from
her
brow
and
thought
her
the
most
wonderful
creature
that
had
ever
trod
the
earth
suddenly
she
looked
at
me
reflectively
i
wonder
she
said
what
made
me
tell
you
about
artemidorus
it
was
a
rather
silly
childish
sort
of
and
i
would
have
told
anyone
else
for
the
world
not
even
my
father
how
did
i
know
that
you
would
sympathize
and
understand
she
asked
the
question
in
all
simplicity
with
her
serious
gray
eyes
looking
inquiringly
into
mine
and
the
answer
came
to
me
in
a
flash
with
the
beating
of
my
own
heart
i
will
tell
you
how
you
know
ruth
i
whispered
passionately
it
was
because
i
loved
you
more
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
has
ever
loved
you
and
you
felt
my
love
in
your
heart
and
called
it
sympathy
i
stopped
short
for
she
had
blushed
scarlet
and
then
turned
deathly
pale
and
now
she
looked
at
me
wildly
almost
with
terror
have
i
shocked
you
ruth
dearest
i
exclaimed
penitently
have
i
spoken
too
soon
if
i
have
forgive
me
but
i
had
to
tell
you
i
have
been
eating
my
heart
out
for
love
of
you
for
i
do
know
how
long
i
think
i
have
loved
you
from
the
first
day
we
met
perhaps
i
should
have
spoken
yet
but
ruth
dear
if
you
only
knew
what
a
sweet
girl
you
are
you
would
blame
me
i
do
blame
you
she
said
almost
in
a
whisper
i
blame
myself
i
have
been
a
bad
friend
to
you
who
have
been
so
loyal
and
loving
to
me
i
ought
not
to
have
let
this
happen
for
it
ca
be
paul
i
say
what
you
want
me
to
say
we
can
never
be
anything
more
to
one
another
than
friends
a
cold
hand
seemed
to
grasp
my
heart
a
horrible
fear
that
i
had
lost
all
that
i
cared
for
all
that
made
life
desirable
why
ca
we
i
asked
do
you
mean
that
that
the
gods
have
been
gracious
to
some
other
man
no
no
she
answered
hastily
almost
indignantly
of
course
i
mean
that
then
it
is
only
that
you
do
love
me
yet
of
course
you
do
why
should
you
but
you
will
dear
some
day
and
i
will
wait
patiently
until
that
day
comes
and
not
trouble
you
with
entreaties
i
will
wait
for
you
as
jacob
waited
for
rachel
and
as
the
long
years
seemed
to
him
but
as
a
few
days
because
of
the
love
he
bore
her
so
it
shall
be
with
me
if
only
you
will
not
send
me
away
quite
without
hope
she
was
looking
down
with
a
hardening
of
the
lips
as
if
she
were
in
bodily
pain
you
do
understand
she
whispered
it
ca
be
it
can
never
be
there
is
something
that
makes
it
impossible
now
and
always
i
ca
tell
you
more
than
that
but
ruth
dearest
i
pleaded
despairingly
may
it
not
become
possible
some
day
can
it
not
be
made
possible
i
can
wait
but
i
ca
give
you
up
is
there
no
chance
whatever
that
this
obstacle
may
be
removed
very
little
i
fear
hardly
any
no
paul
it
is
hopeless
and
i
ca
bear
to
talk
about
it
let
me
go
now
let
us
say
here
and
see
one
another
no
more
for
a
while
perhaps
we
may
be
friends
again
some
day
when
you
have
forgiven
me
forgiven
you
dearest
i
exclaimed
there
is
nothing
to
forgive
and
we
are
friends
ruth
whatever
happens
you
are
the
dearest
friend
i
have
on
earth
or
can
ever
have
thank
you
paul
she
said
faintly
you
are
very
good
to
me
but
let
me
go
please
i
must
be
alone
she
held
out
a
trembling
hand
and
as
i
took
it
i
was
shocked
to
see
how
terribly
agitated
and
ill
she
looked
may
i
not
come
with
you
dear
i
pleaded
no
no
she
exclaimed
breathlessly
i
must
go
away
by
myself
i
want
to
be
alone
before
i
let
you
go
ruth
if
you
must
go
i
must
have
a
most
solemn
promise
from
you
her
sad
gray
eyes
met
mine
and
her
lips
quivered
with
an
unspoken
question
you
must
promise
me
i
went
on
that
if
ever
this
barrier
that
parts
us
should
be
removed
you
will
let
me
know
instantly
remember
that
i
love
you
always
and
that
i
am
waiting
for
you
always
on
this
side
of
the
grave
she
caught
her
breath
in
a
quick
little
sob
and
pressed
my
hand
yes
she
whispered
i
promise
she
pressed
my
hand
again
and
was
gone
and
as
i
gazed
at
the
empty
doorway
through
which
she
had
passed
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
reflection
in
a
glass
on
the
landing
where
she
had
paused
for
a
moment
to
wipe
her
eyes
i
felt
it
in
a
manner
indelicate
to
have
seen
her
and
turned
away
my
head
quickly
and
yet
i
was
conscious
of
a
certain
selfish
satisfaction
in
the
sweet
sympathy
that
her
grief
bespoke
but
now
that
she
was
gone
a
horrible
sense
of
desolation
descended
on
me
only
now
by
the
consciousness
of
irreparable
loss
did
i
begin
to
realize
the
meaning
of
this
passion
of
love
that
had
stolen
unawares
into
my
life
how
it
had
glorified
the
present
and
spread
a
glamor
of
delight
over
the
dimly
considered
future
how
all
pleasures
and
desires
hopes
and
ambitions
had
converged
upon
it
as
a
focus
how
it
had
stood
out
as
the
one
great
reality
behind
which
the
other
circumstances
of
life
were
as
a
background
shimmering
half
seen
immaterial
and
unreal
and
now
it
was
gone
lost
as
it
seemed
beyond
hope
and
that
which
was
left
to
me
was
but
the
empty
frame
from
which
the
picture
had
vanished
i
have
no
idea
how
long
i
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
where
she
had
left
me
wrapped
in
a
dull
consciousness
of
pain
immersed
in
a
reverie
recent
events
flitted
through
my
mind
our
happy
labors
in
the
our
first
visit
to
the
museum
and
this
present
day
that
had
opened
so
brightly
and
with
such
joyous
promise
one
by
one
these
phantoms
of
a
vanished
happiness
came
and
went
occasional
visitors
sauntered
into
the
room
but
the
galleries
were
mostly
empty
that
day
gazed
inquisitively
at
my
motionless
figure
and
went
their
way
and
still
the
dull
intolerable
ache
in
my
breast
went
on
the
only
vivid
consciousness
that
was
left
to
me
presently
i
raised
my
eyes
and
met
those
of
the
portrait
the
sweet
pensive
face
of
the
old
greek
settler
looked
out
at
me
wistfully
as
though
he
would
offer
comfort
as
though
he
would
tell
me
that
he
too
had
known
sorrow
when
he
lived
his
life
in
the
sunny
fayyum
and
a
subtle
consolation
like
the
faint
scent
of
old
rose
leaves
seemed
to
exhale
from
that
friendly
face
that
had
looked
on
the
birth
of
my
happiness
and
had
seen
it
wither
and
fade
i
turned
away
at
last
with
a
silent
farewell
and
when
i
looked
back
he
seemed
to
speed
me
on
my
way
with
gentle
valediction
chapter
xvii
the
accusing
finger
of
my
wanderings
after
i
left
the
museum
on
that
black
and
dismal
i
have
but
a
dim
recollection
but
i
must
have
traveled
a
quite
considerable
distance
since
it
wanted
an
hour
or
two
to
the
time
for
returning
to
the
surgery
and
i
spent
the
interval
walking
swiftly
through
streets
and
squares
unmindful
of
the
happenings
around
intent
only
on
my
present
misfortune
and
driven
by
a
natural
impulse
to
seek
relief
in
bodily
exertion
for
mental
distress
sets
up
as
it
were
a
sort
of
induced
current
of
physical
unrest
a
beneficent
arrangement
by
which
a
dangerous
excess
of
emotional
excitement
may
be
transformed
into
motor
energy
and
so
safely
got
rid
of
the
motor
apparatus
acts
as
a
to
the
psychical
and
if
the
engine
races
for
a
while
with
the
onset
of
a
bodily
fatigue
the
emotional
returns
to
a
normal
reading
and
so
it
was
with
me
at
first
i
was
conscious
of
nothing
but
a
sense
of
utter
bereavement
of
the
shipwreck
of
all
my
hopes
but
by
degrees
as
i
threaded
my
way
among
the
moving
crowds
i
came
to
a
better
and
more
worthy
frame
of
mind
after
all
i
had
lost
nothing
that
i
had
ever
had
ruth
was
still
all
that
she
had
ever
been
to
me
perhaps
even
more
and
if
that
had
been
a
rich
endowment
yesterday
why
not
also
and
how
unfair
it
would
be
to
her
if
i
should
mope
and
grieve
over
a
disappointment
that
was
no
fault
of
hers
and
for
which
there
was
no
remedy
thus
i
reasoned
with
myself
and
to
such
purpose
that
by
the
time
i
reached
fetter
lane
my
dejection
had
come
to
quite
manageable
proportions
and
i
had
formed
the
resolution
to
get
back
to
the
quo
ante
as
soon
as
possible
about
eight
as
i
was
sitting
alone
in
the
gloomily
persuading
myself
that
i
was
now
quite
resigned
to
the
inevitable
adolphus
brought
me
a
registered
packet
at
the
handwriting
on
which
my
heart
gave
such
a
bound
that
i
had
much
ado
to
sign
the
receipt
as
soon
as
adolphus
had
retired
with
undissembled
contempt
of
the
shaky
signature
i
tore
open
the
packet
and
as
i
drew
out
a
letter
a
tiny
box
dropped
on
the
table
the
letter
was
all
too
short
and
i
devoured
it
over
and
over
again
with
the
eagerness
of
a
condemned
man
reading
a
reprieve
my
dear
paul
me
for
leaving
you
so
abruptly
this
afternoon
and
leaving
you
so
unhappy
too
i
am
more
sane
and
reasonable
now
and
so
send
you
greeting
and
beg
you
not
to
grieve
for
that
which
can
never
be
it
is
quite
impossible
dear
friend
and
i
entreat
you
as
you
care
for
me
never
to
speak
of
it
again
never
again
to
make
me
feel
that
i
can
give
you
so
little
when
you
have
given
so
much
and
do
not
try
to
see
me
for
a
little
while
i
shall
miss
your
visits
and
so
will
my
father
who
is
very
fond
of
you
but
it
is
better
that
we
should
not
meet
until
we
can
take
up
our
old
relations
if
that
can
ever
am
sending
you
a
little
keepsake
in
case
we
should
drift
apart
on
the
eddies
of
life
it
is
the
ring
that
i
told
you
about
the
one
that
my
uncle
gave
me
perhaps
you
may
be
able
to
wear
it
as
you
have
a
small
hand
but
in
any
case
keep
it
in
remembrance
of
our
friendship
the
device
on
it
is
the
eye
of
osiris
a
mystic
symbol
for
which
i
have
a
sentimentally
superstitious
affection
as
also
had
my
poor
uncle
who
actually
bore
it
tattooed
in
scarlet
on
his
breast
it
signifies
that
the
great
judge
of
the
dead
looks
down
on
men
to
see
that
justice
is
done
and
that
truth
prevails
so
i
commend
you
to
the
good
osiris
may
his
eye
be
upon
you
ever
watchful
over
your
welfare
in
the
absence
affectionate
friend
ruth
it
was
a
sweet
letter
i
thought
even
if
it
carried
little
comfort
quiet
and
reticent
like
its
writer
but
with
an
undertone
of
affection
i
laid
it
down
at
length
and
taking
the
ring
from
its
box
examined
it
fondly
though
but
a
copy
it
had
all
the
quaintness
and
feeling
of
the
antique
original
and
above
all
it
was
fragrant
with
the
spirit
of
the
giver
dainty
and
delicate
wrought
of
silver
and
gold
with
an
inlay
of
copper
i
would
not
have
exchanged
it
for
the
and
when
i
had
slipped
it
on
my
finger
its
tiny
eye
of
blue
enamel
looked
up
at
me
so
friendly
and
companionable
that
i
felt
the
glamour
of
the
superstition
stealing
over
me
too
not
a
single
patient
came
in
this
evening
which
was
well
for
me
and
also
for
the
patient
as
i
was
able
forthwith
to
write
in
reply
a
long
letter
but
this
i
shall
spare
the
reader
excepting
its
concluding
paragraph
now
dearest
i
have
said
my
say
once
for
all
i
have
said
it
and
i
will
not
open
my
mouth
on
the
subject
again
i
am
not
actually
opening
it
now
the
times
do
alter
and
if
the
times
do
never
alter
if
it
shall
come
to
pass
in
due
course
that
we
two
shall
sit
side
by
side
and
and
lean
our
poor
old
chins
upon
our
sticks
and
mumble
and
gibber
amicably
over
the
things
that
might
have
been
if
the
good
osiris
had
come
up
to
the
scratch
i
will
still
be
content
because
your
friendship
ruth
is
better
than
another
woman
love
so
you
see
i
have
taken
my
gruel
and
come
up
to
time
smiling
if
you
will
pardon
the
pugilistic
metaphor
and
i
promise
you
loyally
to
do
your
bidding
and
never
again
to
distress
faithful
and
loving
friend
paul
this
letter
i
addressed
and
stamped
and
then
with
a
wry
grimace
which
i
palmed
off
on
myself
but
not
on
adolphus
as
a
cheerful
smile
i
went
out
and
dropped
it
into
the
after
which
i
further
deluded
myself
by
murmuring
and
assuring
myself
that
the
incident
was
now
absolutely
closed
but
despite
this
comfortable
assurance
i
was
in
the
days
that
followed
an
exceedingly
miserable
young
man
it
is
all
very
well
to
write
down
troubles
of
this
kind
as
trivial
and
sentimental
they
are
nothing
of
the
kind
when
a
man
of
essentially
serious
nature
has
found
the
one
woman
of
all
the
world
who
fulfils
his
highest
ideals
of
womanhood
who
is
in
fact
a
woman
in
ten
thousand
to
whom
he
has
given
all
that
he
has
to
give
of
love
and
worship
the
sudden
wreck
of
all
his
hopes
is
no
small
calamity
and
so
i
found
it
resign
myself
as
i
would
to
the
bitter
reality
the
ghost
of
the
haunted
me
night
and
day
so
that
i
spent
my
leisure
wandering
abstractedly
about
the
streets
always
trying
to
banish
thought
and
never
for
an
instant
succeeding
a
great
unrest
was
upon
me
and
when
i
received
a
letter
from
dick
barnard
announcing
his
arrival
at
madeira
homeward
bound
i
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
i
had
no
plans
for
the
future
but
i
longed
to
be
rid
of
the
now
irksome
routine
of
the
practise
to
be
free
to
come
and
go
when
and
how
i
pleased
one
evening
as
i
sat
consuming
with
little
appetite
my
solitary
supper
there
fell
on
me
a
sudden
sense
of
loneliness
the
desire
that
i
had
hitherto
felt
to
be
alone
with
my
own
miserable
reflections
gave
place
to
a
yearning
for
human
companionship
that
indeed
which
i
craved
for
most
was
forbidden
and
i
must
abide
by
my
lady
wishes
but
there
were
my
friends
in
the
temple
it
was
more
than
a
week
since
i
had
seen
them
in
fact
we
had
not
met
since
the
morning
of
that
unhappiest
day
of
my
life
they
would
be
wondering
what
had
become
of
me
i
rose
from
the
table
and
having
filled
my
pouch
from
a
tin
of
tobacco
set
forth
for
king
bench
walk
as
i
approached
the
entry
of
no
in
the
gathering
darkness
i
met
thorndyke
himself
emerging
encumbered
with
two
a
and
a
book
why
berkeley
he
exclaimed
is
it
indeed
thou
we
have
been
wondering
what
had
become
of
you
it
a
long
time
since
i
looked
you
up
i
admitted
he
scrutinized
me
attentively
by
the
light
of
the
entry
lamp
and
then
remarked
fetter
lane
does
seem
to
be
agreeing
with
you
very
well
my
son
you
are
looking
quite
thin
and
peaky
well
i
nearly
done
with
it
barnard
will
be
back
in
about
ten
days
his
ship
is
putting
in
at
madeira
to
coal
and
take
in
some
cargo
and
then
he
is
coming
home
where
are
you
going
with
those
chairs
i
am
going
to
sit
down
at
the
end
of
the
walk
by
the
railings
cooler
there
than
indoors
if
you
will
wait
a
moment
i
will
go
and
fetch
another
chair
for
jervis
though
he
wo
be
back
for
a
little
while
he
ran
up
the
stairs
and
presently
returned
with
a
third
chair
and
we
carried
our
impedimenta
down
to
the
quiet
corner
of
the
walk
so
your
term
of
servitude
is
coming
to
an
end
said
he
when
we
had
placed
the
chairs
and
hung
the
lantern
on
the
railings
any
other
news
no
have
you
any
i
am
afraid
i
have
not
all
my
inquiries
have
yielded
negative
results
there
is
of
course
a
considerable
body
of
evidence
and
it
all
seems
to
point
one
way
but
i
am
unwilling
to
make
a
decisive
move
without
something
more
definite
i
am
really
waiting
for
confirmation
or
otherwise
of
my
ideas
on
the
subject
for
some
new
item
of
evidence
i
did
know
there
was
any
evidence
did
you
said
thorndyke
but
you
know
as
much
as
i
know
you
have
all
the
essential
facts
but
apparently
you
have
collated
them
and
extracted
their
meaning
if
you
had
you
would
have
found
them
curiously
significant
i
suppose
i
must
ask
what
their
significance
is
no
i
think
not
when
i
am
conducting
a
case
i
mention
my
surmises
to
nobody
not
even
to
jervis
then
i
can
say
confidently
that
there
has
been
no
leakage
do
think
i
distrust
you
remember
that
my
thoughts
are
my
client
property
and
that
the
essence
of
strategy
is
to
keep
the
enemy
in
the
dark
yes
i
see
that
of
course
i
ought
not
to
have
asked
you
ought
not
to
need
to
ask
thorndyke
replied
with
a
smile
you
should
put
the
facts
together
and
reason
from
them
yourself
while
we
had
been
talking
i
had
noticed
thorndyke
glance
at
me
inquisitively
from
time
to
time
now
after
an
interval
of
silence
he
asked
suddenly
is
anything
amiss
berkeley
are
you
worrying
about
your
affairs
no
not
particularly
though
their
prospects
do
look
very
rosy
perhaps
they
are
not
quite
so
bad
as
they
look
said
he
but
i
am
afraid
something
is
troubling
you
all
your
gay
spirits
seem
to
have
evaporated
he
paused
for
a
few
moments
and
then
added
i
want
to
intrude
on
your
private
affairs
but
if
i
can
help
you
by
advice
or
otherwise
remember
that
we
are
old
friends
and
that
you
are
my
academic
offspring
instinctively
with
a
man
natural
reticence
i
began
to
mumble
a
disclaimer
and
then
i
stopped
after
all
why
should
i
not
confide
in
him
he
was
a
good
man
and
a
wise
man
full
of
human
sympathy
as
i
knew
though
so
cryptic
and
secretive
in
his
professional
capacity
and
i
wanted
a
friend
badly
just
now
i
afraid
i
began
shyly
it
is
not
a
matter
that
admits
of
much
help
and
it
hardly
the
sort
of
thing
that
i
ought
to
worry
you
by
talking
about
if
it
is
enough
to
make
you
unhappy
my
dear
fellow
it
is
enough
to
merit
serious
consideration
by
your
friend
so
if
you
do
mind
telling
me
of
course
i
do
sir
i
exclaimed
then
fire
away
and
do
call
me
we
are
brother
practitioners
now
thus
encouraged
i
poured
out
the
story
of
my
little
romance
bashfully
at
first
and
with
halting
phrases
but
later
with
more
freedom
and
confidence
he
listened
with
grave
attention
and
once
or
twice
put
a
question
when
my
narrative
became
a
little
disconnected
when
i
had
finished
he
laid
his
hand
softly
on
my
arm
you
have
had
rough
luck
berkeley
i
do
wonder
that
you
are
miserable
i
am
more
sorry
than
i
can
tell
you
thank
you
i
said
it
exceedingly
good
of
you
to
listen
so
patiently
but
it
a
shame
for
me
to
pester
you
with
my
sentimental
troubles
now
berkeley
you
do
think
that
and
i
hope
you
do
think
that
i
do
we
should
be
bad
biologists
and
worse
physicians
if
we
should
underestimate
the
importance
of
that
which
is
nature
chiefest
care
the
one
salient
biological
truth
is
the
paramount
importance
of
sex
and
we
are
deaf
and
blind
if
we
do
not
hear
and
see
it
in
everything
that
lives
when
we
look
abroad
upon
the
world
when
we
listen
to
the
spring
song
of
the
birds
or
when
we
consider
the
lilies
of
the
field
and
as
is
man
to
the
lower
organisms
so
is
human
love
to
their
merely
reflex
manifestations
of
sex
i
will
maintain
and
you
will
agree
with
me
i
know
that
the
love
of
a
serious
and
honorable
man
for
a
woman
who
is
worthy
of
him
is
the
most
momentous
of
all
human
affairs
it
is
the
foundation
of
social
life
and
its
failure
is
a
serious
calamity
not
only
to
those
whose
lives
may
be
thereby
spoilt
but
to
society
at
large
it
a
serious
enough
matter
for
the
parties
concerned
i
agreed
but
that
is
no
reason
why
they
should
bore
their
friends
but
they
do
friends
should
help
one
another
and
think
it
a
privilege
oh
i
should
mind
coming
to
you
for
help
knowing
you
as
i
do
but
no
one
can
help
a
poor
devil
in
a
case
like
this
and
certainly
not
a
medical
jurist
oh
come
berkeley
he
protested
do
rate
us
too
low
the
humblest
of
creatures
has
its
uses
the
little
pismire
you
know
as
izaak
walton
tells
us
why
i
have
got
substantial
help
from
a
and
then
reflect
upon
the
and
the
earthworm
and
the
all
these
lowly
creatures
play
their
parts
in
the
scheme
of
nature
and
shall
we
cast
out
the
medical
jurist
as
nothing
worth
i
laughed
dejectedly
at
my
teacher
genial
irony
what
i
meant
said
i
was
that
there
is
nothing
to
be
done
but
wait
perhaps
for
ever
i
do
know
why
she
is
able
to
marry
me
and
i
must
ask
her
she
ca
be
married
already
certainly
not
she
told
you
explicitly
that
there
was
no
man
in
the
case
exactly
and
i
can
think
of
no
other
valid
reason
excepting
that
she
does
care
enough
for
me
that
would
be
a
perfectly
sound
reason
but
then
it
would
only
be
a
temporary
one
not
the
insuperable
obstacle
that
she
assumes
to
exist
especially
as
we
really
got
on
excellently
together
i
hope
it
is
some
confounded
perverse
feminine
scruple
i
do
see
how
it
could
be
but
women
are
most
frightfully
tortuous
and
at
times
i
do
see
said
thorndyke
why
we
should
cast
about
for
perversely
abnormal
motives
when
there
is
a
perfectly
reasonable
explanation
staring
us
in
the
face
is
there
i
exclaimed
i
see
none
you
are
not
unnaturally
overlooking
some
of
the
circumstances
that
affect
miss
bellingham
but
i
do
suppose
she
has
failed
to
grasp
their
meaning
do
you
realize
what
her
position
really
is
i
mean
with
regard
to
her
uncle
disappearance
i
do
think
i
quite
understand
you
well
there
is
no
use
in
blinking
the
facts
said
thorndyke
the
position
is
this
if
john
bellingham
ever
went
to
his
brother
house
at
woodford
it
is
nearly
certain
that
he
went
there
after
his
visit
to
hurst
mind
i
say
he
went
i
do
say
that
i
believe
he
did
but
it
is
stated
that
he
appears
to
have
gone
there
and
if
he
did
go
he
was
never
seen
alive
afterward
now
he
did
not
go
in
at
the
front
door
no
one
saw
him
enter
the
house
but
there
was
a
back
gate
which
john
bellingham
knew
and
which
had
a
bell
which
rang
in
the
library
and
you
will
remember
that
when
hurst
and
jellicoe
called
bellingham
had
only
just
come
in
previous
to
that
time
miss
bellingham
had
been
alone
in
the
library
that
is
to
say
she
was
alone
in
the
library
at
the
very
time
when
john
bellingham
is
said
to
have
made
his
visit
that
is
the
position
berkeley
nothing
pointed
has
been
said
up
to
the
present
but
sooner
or
later
if
john
bellingham
is
not
found
dead
or
alive
the
question
will
be
opened
then
it
is
certain
that
hurst
in
will
make
the
most
of
any
facts
that
may
transfer
suspicion
from
him
to
some
one
else
and
that
some
one
else
will
be
miss
bellingham
i
sat
for
some
moments
literally
paralyzed
with
horror
then
my
dismay
gave
place
to
indignation
but
damn
it
i
exclaimed
starting
up
i
beg
your
pardon
but
could
anyone
have
the
infernal
audacity
to
insinuate
that
that
gentle
refined
lady
murdered
her
uncle
that
is
what
will
be
hinted
if
not
plainly
asserted
and
she
knows
it
and
that
being
so
is
it
difficult
to
understand
why
she
should
refuse
to
allow
you
to
be
publicly
associated
with
her
to
run
the
risk
of
dragging
your
honorable
name
into
the
sordid
transactions
of
the
or
the
old
bailey
to
invest
it
perhaps
with
a
dreadful
notoriety
oh
do
for
god
sake
it
is
too
horrible
not
that
i
would
care
for
myself
i
would
be
proud
to
share
her
martyrdom
of
ignominy
if
it
had
to
be
but
it
is
the
sacrilege
the
blasphemy
of
even
thinking
of
her
in
such
terms
that
enrages
me
yes
said
thorndyke
i
understand
and
sympathize
with
you
indeed
i
share
your
righteous
indignation
at
this
dastardly
affair
so
you
must
think
me
brutal
for
putting
the
case
so
plainly
i
do
you
have
only
shown
me
the
danger
that
i
was
fool
enough
not
to
see
but
you
seem
to
imply
that
this
hideous
position
has
been
brought
about
deliberately
certainly
i
do
this
is
no
chance
affair
either
the
appearances
indicate
the
real
events
which
i
am
sure
they
do
not
or
they
have
been
created
of
a
set
purpose
to
lead
to
false
conclusions
but
the
circumstances
convince
me
that
there
has
been
a
deliberate
plot
and
i
am
waiting
in
no
spirit
of
christian
patience
i
can
tell
you
to
lay
my
hand
on
the
wretch
who
has
done
this
what
are
you
waiting
for
i
asked
i
am
waiting
for
the
inevitable
he
replied
for
the
false
move
that
the
most
artful
criminal
invariably
makes
at
present
he
is
lying
low
but
presently
he
will
make
a
move
and
then
i
shall
have
him
but
he
may
go
on
lying
low
what
will
you
do
then
yes
that
is
the
danger
we
may
have
to
deal
with
the
perfect
villain
who
knows
when
to
leave
well
alone
i
have
never
met
him
but
he
may
exist
nevertheless
and
then
we
should
have
to
stand
by
and
see
our
friends
go
under
perhaps
said
thorndyke
and
we
both
subsided
into
gloomy
and
silent
reflection
the
place
was
peaceful
and
quiet
as
only
a
backwater
of
london
can
be
occasional
hoots
from
tugs
and
steamers
told
of
the
busy
life
down
below
in
the
crowded
pool
a
faint
hum
of
traffic
was
borne
in
from
the
streets
outside
the
precincts
and
the
shrill
voices
of
newspaper
boys
came
in
unceasing
chorus
from
the
direction
of
carmelite
street
they
were
too
far
away
to
be
physically
disturbing
but
the
excited
yells
toned
down
as
they
were
by
distance
nevertheless
stirred
the
very
marrow
in
my
bones
so
dreadfully
suggestive
were
they
of
those
possibilities
of
the
future
at
which
thorndyke
had
hinted
they
seemed
like
the
sinister
shadows
of
coming
misfortunes
perhaps
they
called
up
the
same
association
of
ideas
in
mind
for
he
remarked
presently
the
newsvendor
is
abroad
like
a
bird
of
something
unusual
has
happened
some
public
or
private
calamity
most
likely
and
these
yelling
ghouls
are
out
to
feast
on
the
remains
the
newspaper
men
have
a
good
deal
in
common
with
the
that
hover
over
a
again
we
subsided
into
silence
and
reflection
then
after
an
interval
i
asked
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
help
in
any
way
in
this
investigation
of
yours
that
is
exactly
what
i
have
been
asking
myself
replied
thorndyke
it
would
be
right
and
proper
that
you
should
and
i
think
you
might
how
i
asked
eagerly
i
ca
say
offhand
but
jervis
will
be
going
away
for
his
holiday
almost
at
once
in
fact
he
will
go
off
actual
duty
there
is
very
little
doing
the
long
vacation
is
close
upon
us
and
i
can
do
without
him
but
if
you
would
care
to
come
down
here
and
take
his
place
you
would
be
very
useful
to
me
and
if
there
should
be
anything
to
be
done
in
the
bellinghams
case
i
am
sure
you
would
make
up
in
enthusiasm
for
any
deficiency
in
experience
i
could
really
take
jervis
place
said
i
but
if
you
would
let
me
help
you
in
any
way
it
would
be
a
great
kindness
i
would
rather
clean
your
boots
than
be
out
of
it
altogether
very
well
let
us
leave
it
that
you
come
here
as
soon
as
barnard
has
done
with
you
you
can
have
jervis
room
which
he
does
often
use
nowadays
and
you
will
be
more
happy
here
than
elsewhere
i
know
i
may
as
well
give
you
my
now
i
have
a
duplicate
upstairs
and
you
understand
that
my
chambers
are
yours
too
from
this
moment
he
handed
me
the
and
i
thanked
him
warmly
from
my
heart
for
i
felt
sure
that
the
suggestion
was
made
not
for
any
use
that
i
should
be
to
him
but
for
my
own
peace
of
mind
i
had
hardly
finished
speaking
when
a
quick
step
on
the
paved
walk
caught
my
ear
here
is
jervis
said
thorndyke
we
will
let
him
know
that
there
is
a
locum
tenens
ready
to
step
into
his
shoes
when
he
wants
to
be
off
he
flashed
the
lantern
across
the
path
and
a
few
moments
later
his
junior
stepped
up
briskly
with
a
bundle
of
newspapers
tucked
under
his
arm
it
struck
me
that
jervis
looked
at
me
a
little
queerly
when
he
recognized
me
in
the
dim
light
also
he
was
a
trifle
constrained
in
his
manner
as
if
my
presence
were
an
embarrassment
he
listened
to
thorndyke
announcement
of
our
newly
made
arrangement
without
much
enthusiasm
and
with
none
of
his
customary
facetious
comments
and
again
i
noticed
a
quick
glance
at
me
half
curious
half
uneasy
and
wholly
puzzling
to
me
that
all
right
he
said
when
thorndyke
had
explained
the
situation
i
daresay
you
find
berkeley
as
useful
as
me
and
in
any
case
he
be
better
here
than
staying
on
with
barnard
he
spoke
with
unwonted
gravity
and
there
was
in
his
tone
a
solicitude
for
me
that
attracted
my
notice
and
that
of
thorndyke
as
well
for
the
latter
looked
at
him
curiously
though
he
made
no
comment
after
a
short
silence
however
he
asked
and
what
news
does
my
learned
brother
bring
there
is
a
mighty
shouting
among
the
outer
barbarians
and
i
see
a
bundle
of
newspapers
under
my
learned
friend
arm
has
anything
in
particular
happened
jervis
looked
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
well
yes
he
replied
hesitatingly
something
has
happened
there
it
no
use
beating
about
the
bush
berkeley
may
as
well
learn
it
from
me
as
from
those
yelling
devils
outside
he
took
a
couple
of
papers
from
his
bundle
and
silently
handed
one
to
me
and
the
other
to
thorndyke
jervis
ominous
manner
naturally
enough
alarmed
me
not
a
little
i
opened
the
paper
with
a
nameless
dread
but
whatever
my
vague
fears
they
fell
far
short
of
the
occasion
and
when
i
saw
those
yells
from
without
crystallized
into
scare
and
flaming
capitals
i
turned
for
a
moment
sick
and
dizzy
with
fear
the
paragraph
was
only
a
short
one
and
i
read
it
through
in
less
than
a
minute
the
missing
finger
dramatic
discovery
at
woodford
the
mystery
that
has
surrounded
the
remains
of
a
mutilated
human
body
portions
of
which
have
been
found
in
various
places
in
kent
and
essex
has
received
a
partial
and
very
sinister
solution
the
police
have
all
along
suspected
that
those
remains
were
those
of
a
john
bellingham
who
disappeared
under
circumstances
of
some
suspicion
about
two
years
ago
there
is
now
no
doubt
upon
the
subject
for
the
finger
which
was
missing
from
the
hand
that
was
found
at
sidcup
has
been
discovered
at
the
bottom
of
a
disused
well
with
a
which
has
been
identified
as
one
habitually
worn
by
john
bellingham
the
house
in
the
garden
of
which
the
well
is
situated
was
the
property
of
the
murdered
man
and
was
occupied
at
the
time
of
the
disappearance
by
his
brother
godfrey
bellingham
but
the
latter
left
it
very
soon
after
and
it
has
been
empty
ever
since
just
lately
it
has
been
put
in
repair
and
it
was
in
this
way
that
the
well
came
to
be
emptied
and
cleaned
out
it
seems
that
badger
who
was
searching
the
neighborhood
for
further
remains
heard
of
the
emptying
of
the
well
and
went
down
in
the
bucket
to
examine
the
bottom
where
he
found
the
three
bones
and
the
ring
thus
the
identity
of
the
body
is
established
beyond
all
doubt
and
the
question
that
remains
is
who
killed
john
bellingham
it
may
be
remembered
that
a
trinket
apparently
broken
from
his
was
found
in
the
grounds
of
this
house
on
the
day
that
he
disappeared
and
that
he
was
never
again
seen
alive
what
may
be
the
import
of
these
facts
time
will
show
that
was
all
but
it
was
enough
i
dropped
the
paper
to
the
ground
and
glanced
round
furtively
at
jervis
who
sat
gazing
gloomily
at
the
toes
of
his
boots
it
was
horrible
it
was
incredible
the
blow
was
so
crushing
that
it
left
my
faculties
numb
and
for
a
while
i
seemed
unable
even
to
think
intelligibly
i
was
aroused
by
thorndyke
voice
calm
composed
time
will
show
indeed
but
meanwhile
we
must
go
warily
and
be
unduly
alarmed
berkeley
go
home
take
a
good
dose
of
bromide
with
a
little
stimulant
and
turn
in
i
am
afraid
this
has
been
rather
a
shock
to
you
i
rose
from
my
chair
like
one
in
a
dream
and
held
out
my
hand
to
thorndyke
and
even
in
the
dim
light
and
in
my
dazed
condition
i
noticed
that
his
face
bore
a
look
that
i
had
never
seen
before
the
look
of
a
granite
mask
of
fate
grim
stern
inexorable
my
two
friends
walked
with
me
as
far
as
the
gateway
at
the
top
of
inner
temple
lane
and
as
we
reached
the
entry
a
stranger
coming
quickly
up
the
lane
overtook
and
passed
us
in
the
glare
of
the
lamp
outside
the
porter
lodge
he
looked
at
us
quickly
over
his
shoulder
and
though
he
passed
on
without
halt
or
greeting
i
recognized
him
with
a
certain
dull
surprise
which
i
did
not
understand
then
and
do
not
understand
now
it
was
jellicoe
i
shook
hands
once
more
with
my
friends
and
strode
out
into
fleet
street
but
as
soon
as
i
was
outside
the
gate
i
made
direct
for
nevill
court
what
was
in
my
mind
i
do
not
know
only
that
some
instinct
of
protection
led
me
there
where
my
lady
lay
unconscious
of
the
hideous
menace
that
hung
over
her
at
the
entrance
to
the
court
a
tall
powerful
man
was
lounging
against
the
wall
and
he
seemed
to
look
at
me
curiously
as
i
passed
but
i
hardly
noticed
him
and
strode
forward
into
the
narrow
passage
by
the
shabby
gateway
of
the
house
i
halted
and
looked
up
at
such
of
the
windows
as
i
could
see
over
the
wall
they
were
all
dark
all
the
inmates
then
were
in
bed
vaguely
comforted
by
this
i
walked
on
to
the
new
street
end
of
the
court
and
looked
out
here
too
a
man
a
tall
man
was
loitering
and
as
he
looked
inquisitively
into
my
face
i
turned
and
reëntered
the
court
slowly
retracing
my
steps
as
i
again
reached
the
gate
of
the
house
i
stopped
to
look
once
more
at
the
windows
and
turning
i
found
the
man
whom
i
had
last
noticed
close
behind
me
then
in
a
flash
of
dreadful
comprehension
i
understood
these
two
were
plainclothes
policemen
for
a
moment
a
blind
fury
possessed
me
an
insane
impulse
urged
me
to
give
battle
to
this
intruder
to
avenge
upon
this
person
the
insult
of
his
presence
fortunately
the
impulse
was
but
momentary
and
i
recovered
myself
without
making
any
demonstration
but
the
appearance
of
those
two
policemen
brought
the
peril
into
the
immediate
present
imparted
to
it
a
horrible
actuality
a
chilly
sweat
of
terror
stood
on
my
forehead
and
my
ears
were
ringing
when
i
walked
with
faltering
steps
out
into
fetter
lane
chapter
xviii
john
bellingham
the
next
few
days
were
a
very
nightmare
of
horror
and
gloom
of
course
i
repudiated
my
acceptance
of
the
decree
of
banishment
that
ruth
had
passed
upon
me
i
was
her
friend
at
least
and
in
time
of
peril
my
place
was
at
her
side
tacitly
though
thankfully
enough
poor
girl
she
had
recognized
the
fact
and
made
me
once
more
free
of
the
house
for
there
was
no
disguising
the
situation
newspaper
boys
yelled
the
news
up
and
down
fleet
street
from
morning
to
night
posters
grinned
on
gaping
crowds
and
the
newspapers
fairly
wallowed
in
the
shocking
details
it
is
true
that
no
direct
accusations
were
made
but
the
original
reports
of
the
disappearance
were
reprinted
with
such
comments
as
made
me
gnash
my
teeth
with
fury
the
wretchedness
of
those
days
will
live
in
my
memory
until
my
dying
day
never
can
i
forget
the
dread
that
weighed
me
down
the
horrible
suspense
the
fear
that
clutched
at
my
heart
as
i
furtively
scanned
the
posters
in
the
streets
even
the
wretched
detectives
who
prowled
about
the
entrances
to
nevill
court
became
grateful
to
my
eyes
for
embodying
as
they
did
the
hideous
menace
that
hung
over
my
dear
lady
their
presence
at
least
told
me
that
the
blow
had
not
yet
fallen
indeed
we
came
after
a
time
to
exchange
glances
of
mutual
recognition
and
i
thought
that
they
seemed
to
be
sorry
for
her
and
for
me
and
had
no
great
liking
for
their
task
of
course
i
spent
most
of
my
leisure
at
the
old
house
though
my
heart
ached
more
there
than
elsewhere
and
i
tried
with
but
poor
success
i
fear
to
maintain
a
cheerful
confident
manner
cracking
my
little
jokes
as
of
old
and
even
essaying
to
skirmish
with
miss
oman
but
this
last
experiment
was
a
dead
failure
and
when
she
had
suddenly
broken
down
in
a
stream
of
brilliant
repartee
to
weep
hysterically
on
my
breast
i
abandoned
the
attempt
and
did
not
repeat
it
a
dreadful
gloom
had
settled
down
upon
the
old
house
poor
miss
oman
crept
silently
but
restlessly
up
and
down
the
ancient
stairs
with
dim
eyes
and
a
tremulous
chin
or
moped
in
her
room
with
a
parliamentary
petition
demanding
if
i
remember
rightly
the
appointment
of
a
female
judge
to
deal
with
divorce
and
matrimonial
causes
which
lay
on
her
table
languidly
awaiting
signatures
that
never
came
bellingham
whose
mental
condition
at
first
alternated
between
furious
anger
and
absolute
panic
was
fast
sinking
into
a
state
of
nervous
prostration
that
i
viewed
with
no
little
alarm
in
fact
the
only
really
person
in
the
entire
household
was
ruth
herself
and
even
she
could
not
conceal
the
ravages
of
sorrow
and
suspense
and
overshadowing
peril
her
manner
was
almost
unchanged
or
rather
i
should
say
she
had
gone
back
to
that
which
i
had
first
known
quiet
reserved
taciturn
with
a
certain
bitter
humor
showing
through
her
unvarying
amiability
when
she
and
i
were
alone
indeed
her
reserve
melted
away
and
she
was
all
sweetness
and
gentleness
but
it
wrung
my
heart
to
look
at
her
to
see
how
day
by
day
she
grew
ever
more
thin
and
haggard
to
watch
the
growing
pallor
of
her
cheek
to
look
into
her
solemn
gray
eyes
so
sad
and
tragic
and
yet
so
brave
and
defiant
of
fate
it
was
a
terrible
time
and
through
it
all
the
dreadful
questions
haunted
me
continually
when
will
the
blow
fall
what
is
it
that
the
police
are
waiting
for
and
when
they
do
strike
what
will
thorndyke
have
to
say
so
things
went
on
for
four
dreadful
days
but
on
the
fourth
day
just
as
the
evening
consultations
were
beginning
and
the
surgery
was
filled
with
waiting
patients
polton
appeared
with
a
note
which
he
insisted
to
the
indignation
of
adolphus
on
delivering
into
my
own
hands
it
was
from
thorndyke
and
was
to
the
following
effect
learn
from
norbury
that
he
has
recently
heard
from
herr
lederbogen
of
berlin
a
learned
authority
on
oriental
antiquities
who
makes
some
reference
to
an
english
egyptologist
whom
he
met
in
vienna
about
a
year
ago
he
can
not
recall
the
englishman
name
but
there
are
certain
expressions
in
the
letter
which
make
norbury
suspect
that
he
is
referring
to
john
want
you
to
bring
and
miss
bellingham
to
my
chambers
this
evening
at
to
meet
norbury
and
talk
over
his
letter
and
in
view
of
the
importance
of
the
matter
i
look
to
you
not
to
fail
a
wave
of
hope
and
relief
swept
over
me
it
was
still
possible
that
this
gordian
knot
might
be
cut
that
the
deliverance
might
come
before
it
was
too
late
i
wrote
a
hasty
note
to
thorndyke
and
another
to
ruth
making
the
appointment
and
having
given
them
both
to
the
trusty
polton
returned
somewhat
feverishly
to
my
professional
duties
to
my
profound
relief
the
influx
of
patients
ceased
and
the
practise
sank
into
its
accustomed
torpor
whereby
i
was
able
without
base
and
mendacious
subterfuge
to
escape
in
good
time
to
my
tryst
it
was
near
upon
eight
when
i
passed
through
the
archway
into
nevill
court
the
warm
afternoon
light
had
died
away
for
the
summer
was
running
out
apace
the
last
red
glow
of
the
setting
sun
had
faded
from
the
ancient
roofs
and
chimney
stacks
and
down
in
the
narrow
court
the
shades
of
evening
had
begun
to
gather
in
nooks
and
corners
i
was
due
at
eight
and
as
it
still
wanted
some
minutes
to
the
hour
i
sauntered
slowly
down
the
court
looking
reflectively
on
the
familiar
scene
and
the
friendly
faces
the
day
work
was
drawing
to
a
close
the
little
shops
were
putting
up
their
shutters
lights
were
beginning
to
twinkle
in
parlor
windows
a
solemn
hymn
arose
in
the
old
moravian
chapel
and
its
echoes
stole
out
through
the
dark
entry
that
opens
into
the
court
under
the
archway
here
was
finneymore
a
man
of
versatile
gifts
with
a
leaning
toward
paint
and
varnish
sitting
and
on
a
chair
in
his
garden
smoking
his
pipe
with
a
complacent
eye
on
his
dahlias
there
at
an
open
window
a
young
man
with
a
brush
in
his
hand
and
another
behind
his
ear
stood
up
and
stretched
himself
while
an
older
lady
deftly
rolled
up
a
large
map
the
barber
was
turning
out
the
gas
in
his
little
saloon
the
greengrocer
was
emerging
with
a
cigarette
in
his
mouth
and
an
aster
in
his
buttonhole
and
a
group
of
children
were
escorting
the
lamplighter
on
his
rounds
all
these
good
homely
folk
were
nevill
courtiers
of
the
genuine
breed
born
in
the
court
as
had
been
their
fathers
before
them
for
generations
and
of
such
to
a
great
extent
was
the
population
of
the
place
miss
oman
herself
claimed
aboriginal
descent
and
so
did
the
moravian
lady
next
door
a
connection
of
the
famous
la
trobes
of
the
old
conventicle
whose
history
went
back
to
the
gordon
riots
and
as
to
the
gentleman
who
lived
in
the
ancient
house
at
the
bottom
of
the
court
it
was
reported
that
his
ancestors
had
dwelt
in
that
very
house
since
the
days
of
james
the
first
on
these
facts
i
reflected
as
i
sauntered
down
the
court
on
the
strange
phenomenon
of
an
hamlet
with
its
ancient
population
lingering
in
the
very
heart
of
the
noisy
city
an
island
of
peace
set
in
an
ocean
of
unrest
an
oasis
in
a
desert
of
change
and
ferment
my
meditations
brought
me
to
the
shabby
gate
in
the
high
wall
and
as
i
raised
the
latch
and
pushed
it
open
i
saw
ruth
standing
at
the
door
of
the
house
talking
to
miss
oman
she
was
evidently
waiting
for
me
for
she
wore
her
somber
black
coat
and
hat
and
a
black
veil
and
when
she
saw
me
she
came
out
closing
the
door
after
her
and
holding
out
her
hand
you
are
punctual
said
she
dunstan
clock
is
striking
now
yes
i
answered
but
where
is
your
father
he
has
gone
to
bed
poor
old
dear
he
did
feel
well
enough
to
come
and
i
did
not
urge
him
he
is
really
very
ill
this
dreadful
suspense
will
kill
him
if
it
goes
on
much
longer
let
us
hope
it
wo
i
said
but
with
little
conviction
i
fear
in
my
tone
it
was
harrowing
to
see
her
torn
by
anxiety
for
her
father
and
i
yearned
to
comfort
her
but
what
was
there
to
say
bellingham
was
breaking
up
visibly
under
the
stress
of
the
terrible
menace
that
hung
over
his
daughter
and
no
words
of
mine
could
make
the
fact
less
manifest
we
walked
silently
up
the
court
the
lady
at
the
window
greeted
us
with
a
smiling
salutation
finneymore
removed
his
pipe
and
raised
his
cap
receiving
a
gracious
bow
from
ruth
in
return
and
then
we
passed
through
the
covered
way
into
fetter
lane
where
my
companion
paused
and
looked
about
her
what
are
you
looking
for
i
asked
the
detective
she
answered
quietly
it
would
be
a
pity
if
the
poor
man
should
miss
me
after
waiting
so
long
however
i
do
see
him
and
she
turned
away
toward
fleet
street
it
was
an
unpleasant
surprize
to
me
that
her
sharp
eyes
detected
the
secret
spy
upon
her
movements
and
the
dry
sardonic
tone
of
her
remark
pained
me
too
recalling
as
it
did
the
frigid
that
had
so
repelled
me
in
the
early
days
of
our
acquaintance
and
yet
i
could
not
but
admire
the
cool
unconcern
with
which
she
faced
her
horrible
peril
tell
me
a
little
more
about
this
conference
she
said
as
we
walked
down
fetter
lane
your
note
was
rather
more
concise
than
lucid
but
i
suppose
you
wrote
it
in
a
hurry
yes
i
did
and
i
ca
give
you
any
details
now
all
i
know
is
that
doctor
norbury
has
had
a
letter
from
a
friend
of
his
in
berlin
an
egyptologist
as
i
understand
named
lederbogen
who
refers
to
an
english
acquaintance
of
his
and
norbury
whom
he
saw
in
vienna
about
a
year
ago
he
can
not
remember
the
englishman
name
but
from
some
of
the
circumstances
norbury
seems
to
think
that
he
is
referring
to
your
uncle
john
of
course
if
this
should
turn
out
to
be
really
the
case
it
would
set
everything
straight
so
thorndyke
was
anxious
that
you
and
your
father
should
meet
norbury
and
talk
it
over
i
see
said
ruth
her
tone
was
thoughtful
but
by
no
means
enthusiastic
you
do
seem
to
attach
much
importance
to
the
matter
i
remarked
no
it
does
seem
to
fit
the
circumstances
what
is
the
use
of
suggesting
that
poor
uncle
john
is
alive
and
behaving
like
an
imbecile
which
he
certainly
was
not
when
his
dead
body
has
actually
been
found
but
i
suggested
lamely
there
may
be
some
mistake
it
may
not
be
his
body
after
all
and
the
ring
she
asked
with
a
bitter
smile
that
may
be
just
a
coincidence
it
was
a
copy
of
a
form
of
antique
ring
other
people
may
have
had
copies
made
as
well
as
your
uncle
besides
i
added
with
more
conviction
we
have
seen
the
ring
it
may
not
be
his
at
all
she
shook
her
head
my
dear
paul
she
said
quietly
it
is
useless
to
delude
ourselves
every
known
fact
points
to
the
certainty
that
it
is
his
body
john
bellingham
is
dead
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
that
and
to
every
one
except
his
unknown
murderer
and
one
or
two
of
my
own
loyal
friends
it
must
seem
that
his
death
lies
at
my
door
i
realized
from
the
beginning
that
the
suspicion
lay
between
george
hurst
and
me
and
the
finding
of
the
ring
fixes
it
definitely
on
me
i
am
only
surprised
that
the
police
have
made
no
move
yet
the
quiet
conviction
of
her
tone
left
me
for
a
while
speechless
with
horror
and
despair
then
i
recalled
thorndyke
calm
even
confident
attitude
and
i
hastened
to
remind
her
of
it
there
is
one
of
your
friends
i
said
who
is
still
undismayed
thorndyke
seems
to
anticipate
no
difficulties
and
yet
she
replied
he
is
ready
to
consider
a
forlorn
hope
like
this
however
we
shall
see
i
could
think
of
nothing
more
to
say
and
it
was
in
gloomy
silence
that
we
pursued
our
way
down
inner
temple
lane
and
through
the
dark
entries
and
passages
that
brought
us
out
at
length
by
the
treasury
i
do
see
any
light
in
thorndyke
chambers
i
said
as
we
crossed
king
bench
walk
and
i
pointed
out
the
row
of
windows
all
dark
and
blank
no
and
yet
the
shutters
are
not
closed
he
must
be
out
he
ca
be
after
making
an
appointment
with
you
and
your
father
it
is
most
mysterious
thorndyke
is
so
very
punctilious
about
his
engagements
the
mystery
was
solved
when
we
reached
the
landing
by
a
slip
of
paper
fixed
by
a
tack
on
the
oak
a
note
for
is
on
the
table
was
the
laconic
message
on
reading
which
i
inserted
my
key
swung
the
heavy
door
outward
and
opened
the
lighter
inner
door
the
note
was
lying
on
the
table
and
i
brought
it
out
to
the
landing
to
read
by
the
light
of
the
staircase
lamp
to
our
friends
it
ran
the
slight
change
of
programme
norbury
is
anxious
that
i
should
get
my
experiments
over
before
the
director
returns
so
as
to
save
discussion
he
has
asked
me
to
begin
and
says
he
will
see
and
miss
bellingham
here
at
the
museum
please
bring
them
along
at
once
i
think
some
matters
of
importance
may
transpire
at
the
interview
i
hope
you
do
mind
i
said
apologetically
when
i
had
read
the
note
to
ruth
of
course
i
do
she
replied
i
am
rather
pleased
we
have
so
many
associations
with
the
dear
old
museum
have
we
she
looked
at
me
for
a
moment
with
a
strange
and
touching
wistfulness
and
then
turned
to
descend
the
stone
stairs
at
the
temple
gate
i
hailed
a
hansom
and
we
were
soon
speeding
westward
and
north
to
the
soft
twinkle
of
the
horse
bell
what
are
these
experiments
that
doctor
thorndyke
refers
to
she
asked
presently
i
can
only
answer
you
vaguely
i
replied
their
object
i
believe
is
to
ascertain
whether
the
penetrability
of
organic
substances
by
the
becomes
altered
by
age
whether
for
instance
an
ancient
block
of
wood
is
more
or
less
transparent
to
the
rays
than
a
new
block
of
the
same
size
and
of
what
use
would
the
knowledge
be
if
it
were
obtained
i
ca
say
experiments
are
made
to
obtain
knowledge
without
regard
to
its
utility
the
use
appears
when
the
knowledge
has
been
acquired
but
in
this
case
if
it
should
be
possible
to
determine
the
age
of
any
organic
substance
by
its
reaction
to
the
discovery
might
be
found
of
some
value
in
legal
practise
as
in
demonstrating
a
new
seal
on
an
old
document
for
instance
but
i
do
know
whether
thorndyke
has
anything
definite
in
view
i
only
know
that
the
preparations
have
been
on
a
most
portentous
scale
how
do
you
mean
in
regard
to
size
when
i
went
into
the
workshop
yesterday
morning
i
found
polton
erecting
a
kind
of
portable
gallows
about
nine
feet
high
and
he
had
just
finished
varnishing
a
pair
of
enormous
wooden
trays
each
over
six
feet
long
it
looked
as
if
he
and
thorndyke
were
contemplating
a
few
private
executions
with
subsequent
on
the
victims
what
a
horrible
suggestion
so
polton
said
with
his
quaint
crinkly
smile
but
he
was
mighty
close
about
the
use
of
the
apparatus
all
the
same
i
wonder
if
we
shall
see
anything
of
the
experiments
when
we
get
there
this
is
museum
street
is
it
yes
as
she
spoke
she
lifted
the
flap
of
one
of
the
little
windows
in
the
back
of
the
cab
and
peered
out
then
closing
it
with
a
quiet
ironic
smile
she
said
it
is
all
right
he
has
missed
us
it
will
be
quite
a
nice
little
change
for
him
the
cab
swung
round
into
great
russell
street
and
glancing
out
as
it
turned
i
saw
another
hansom
following
but
before
i
had
time
to
inspect
its
solitary
passenger
we
drew
up
at
the
museum
gates
the
gate
porter
who
seemed
to
expect
us
ushered
us
up
the
drive
to
the
great
portico
and
into
the
central
hall
where
he
handed
us
over
to
another
official
doctor
norbury
is
in
one
of
the
rooms
adjoining
the
fourth
egyptian
room
the
latter
stated
in
answer
to
our
inquiries
and
providing
himself
with
a
lantern
he
prepared
to
escort
us
thither
up
the
great
staircase
now
wrapped
in
mysterious
gloom
we
passed
in
silence
with
memories
of
that
day
of
days
when
we
had
first
trodden
its
steps
together
through
the
central
saloon
the
medieval
room
and
the
asiatic
saloon
and
so
into
the
long
range
of
the
ethnographical
galleries
it
was
a
weird
journey
the
swaying
lantern
shot
its
beams
abroad
into
the
darkness
of
the
great
dim
galleries
casting
instantaneous
flashes
on
the
objects
in
the
cases
so
that
they
leaped
into
being
and
vanished
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
hideous
idols
with
round
staring
eyes
started
forth
from
the
darkness
glared
at
us
for
an
instant
and
were
gone
grotesque
masks
suddenly
revealed
by
the
shimmering
light
took
on
the
semblance
of
demon
faces
that
seemed
to
mow
and
gibber
at
us
as
we
passed
as
for
the
models
realistic
enough
by
daylight
their
aspect
was
positively
alarming
for
the
moving
light
and
shadow
endowed
them
with
life
and
movement
so
that
they
seemed
to
watch
us
furtively
to
lie
in
wait
and
to
hold
themselves
in
readiness
to
steal
out
and
follow
us
the
illusion
evidently
affected
ruth
as
well
as
me
for
she
drew
nearer
to
me
and
whispered
these
figures
are
quite
startling
did
you
see
that
polynesian
i
really
felt
as
if
he
were
going
to
spring
out
on
us
they
are
rather
uncanny
i
admitted
but
the
danger
is
over
now
we
are
passing
out
of
their
sphere
of
influence
we
came
out
on
a
landing
as
i
spoke
and
then
turned
sharply
to
the
left
along
the
north
gallery
from
the
center
of
which
we
entered
the
fourth
egyptian
room
almost
immediately
a
door
in
the
opposite
wall
opened
a
peculiar
humming
sound
became
audible
and
jervis
came
out
on
tiptoe
with
his
hand
raised
tread
as
lightly
as
you
can
he
said
we
are
just
making
an
exposure
the
attendant
turned
back
with
his
lantern
and
we
followed
jervis
into
the
room
from
whence
he
had
come
it
was
a
large
room
and
little
lighter
than
the
galleries
for
the
single
that
burned
at
the
end
where
we
entered
left
the
rest
of
the
apartment
in
almost
complete
obscurity
we
seated
ourselves
at
once
on
the
chairs
that
had
been
placed
for
us
and
when
the
mutual
salutations
had
been
exchanged
i
looked
about
me
there
were
three
people
in
the
room
besides
jervis
thorndyke
who
sat
with
his
watch
in
his
hand
a
gentleman
whom
i
took
to
be
norbury
and
a
smaller
person
at
the
dim
farther
end
undistinguishable
but
probably
polton
at
our
end
of
the
room
were
the
two
large
trays
that
i
had
seen
in
the
workshop
now
mounted
on
trestles
and
each
fitted
with
a
rubber
leading
down
to
a
bucket
at
the
farther
end
of
the
room
the
sinister
shape
of
the
gallows
reared
itself
aloft
in
the
gloom
only
now
i
could
see
that
it
was
not
a
gallows
at
all
for
affixed
to
the
top
was
a
large
bottomless
glass
basin
inside
which
was
a
glass
bulb
that
glowed
with
a
strange
green
light
and
in
the
heart
of
the
bulb
a
bright
spot
of
red
it
was
all
clear
enough
so
far
the
peculiar
sound
that
filled
the
air
was
the
hum
of
the
interrupter
the
bulb
was
of
course
a
crookes
tube
and
the
red
spot
inside
it
the
glowing
disc
of
the
clearly
an
photograph
was
being
made
but
of
what
i
strained
my
eyes
peering
into
the
gloom
at
the
foot
of
the
gallows
but
though
i
could
make
out
an
elongated
object
lying
on
the
floor
directly
under
the
bulb
i
could
not
resolve
the
dimly
seen
shape
into
anything
recognizable
presently
however
norbury
supplied
the
clue
i
am
rather
surprized
said
he
that
you
chose
so
composite
an
object
as
a
mummy
to
begin
on
i
should
have
thought
that
a
simpler
object
such
as
a
coffin
or
a
wooden
figure
would
have
been
more
instructive
in
some
ways
it
would
replied
thorndyke
but
the
variety
of
materials
that
the
mummy
gives
us
has
its
advantages
i
hope
your
father
is
not
ill
miss
bellingham
he
is
not
at
all
well
said
ruth
and
we
agreed
that
it
was
better
for
me
to
come
alone
i
knew
herr
lederbogen
quite
well
he
stayed
with
us
for
a
time
when
he
was
in
england
i
trust
said
norbury
that
i
have
not
troubled
you
for
nothing
herr
lederbogen
speaks
of
erratic
english
friend
with
the
long
name
that
i
can
never
remember
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
he
might
be
referring
to
your
uncle
i
should
hardly
have
called
my
uncle
erratic
said
ruth
no
no
certainly
not
norbury
agreed
hastily
however
you
shall
see
the
letter
presently
and
judge
for
yourself
we
introduce
irrelevant
topics
while
the
experiment
is
in
progress
must
we
doctor
you
had
better
wait
until
we
have
finished
said
thorndyke
because
i
am
going
to
turn
out
the
light
switch
off
the
current
polton
the
green
light
vanished
from
the
bulb
the
hum
of
the
interrupter
swept
down
an
octave
or
two
and
died
away
then
thorndyke
and
norbury
rose
from
their
chairs
and
went
toward
the
mummy
which
they
lifted
tenderly
while
polton
drew
from
beneath
it
what
presently
turned
out
to
be
a
huge
black
paper
envelope
the
single
was
switched
off
leaving
the
room
in
total
darkness
until
there
burst
out
suddenly
a
bright
orange
red
light
immediately
above
one
of
the
trays
we
all
gathered
round
to
watch
as
polton
the
high
priest
of
these
mysteries
drew
from
the
black
envelope
a
colossal
sheet
of
bromide
paper
laid
it
carefully
in
the
tray
and
proceeded
to
wet
it
with
a
large
brush
which
he
had
dipped
in
a
pail
of
water
i
thought
you
always
used
plates
for
this
kind
of
work
said
norbury
we
do
by
preference
but
a
plate
would
be
impossible
so
i
had
a
special
paper
made
to
the
size
there
is
something
singularly
fascinating
in
the
appearance
of
a
developing
photograph
in
the
gradual
mysterious
emergence
of
the
picture
from
the
blank
white
surface
of
plate
or
paper
but
a
skiagraph
or
photograph
has
a
fascination
all
its
own
unlike
the
ordinary
photograph
which
yields
a
picture
of
things
already
seen
it
gives
a
presentment
of
objects
hitherto
invisible
and
hence
when
polton
poured
the
developer
on
the
already
wet
paper
we
all
craned
over
the
tray
with
the
keenest
curiosity
the
developer
was
evidently
a
very
slow
one
for
fully
half
a
minute
no
change
could
be
seen
in
the
uniform
surface
then
gradually
almost
insensibly
the
marginal
portion
began
to
darken
leaving
the
outline
of
the
mummy
in
pale
relief
the
change
once
started
proceeded
apace
darker
and
darker
grew
the
margin
of
the
paper
until
from
slaty
gray
it
had
turned
to
black
and
still
the
shape
of
the
mummy
now
in
strong
relief
remained
an
enlongated
patch
of
bald
white
but
not
for
long
presently
the
white
shape
began
to
be
tinged
with
gray
and
as
the
color
deepened
there
grew
out
of
it
a
paler
form
that
seemed
to
steal
out
of
the
enshrouding
gray
like
an
apparition
spectral
awesome
mysterious
the
skeleton
was
coming
into
view
it
is
rather
uncanny
said
norbury
i
feel
as
if
i
were
assisting
at
some
unholy
rite
just
look
at
it
now
the
gray
shadow
of
the
cartonnage
the
wrappings
and
the
flesh
was
fading
away
into
the
background
and
the
white
skeleton
stood
out
in
sharp
contrast
and
it
certainly
was
rather
a
weird
spectacle
you
lose
the
bones
if
you
develop
much
farther
said
norbury
i
must
let
the
bones
darken
thorndyke
replied
in
case
there
are
any
metallic
objects
i
have
three
more
papers
in
the
envelope
the
white
shape
of
the
skeleton
now
began
to
gray
over
and
as
norbury
had
said
its
distinctness
became
less
and
yet
less
thorndyke
leaned
over
the
tray
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
point
in
the
middle
of
the
breast
and
we
all
watched
him
in
silence
suddenly
he
rose
now
polton
he
said
sharply
get
the
hypo
on
as
quickly
as
you
can
polton
who
had
been
waiting
with
his
hand
on
the
of
the
rapidly
ran
off
the
developer
into
the
bucket
and
flooded
the
paper
with
the
fixing
solution
now
we
can
look
at
it
at
our
leisure
said
thorndyke
after
waiting
a
few
seconds
he
switched
on
one
of
the
and
as
the
flood
of
light
fell
on
the
photograph
he
added
you
see
we
have
quite
lost
the
skeleton
no
norbury
put
on
a
pair
of
spectacles
and
bent
down
over
the
tray
and
at
this
moment
i
felt
ruth
hand
touch
my
arm
lightly
at
first
and
then
with
a
strong
nervous
grasp
and
i
could
feel
that
her
hand
was
trembling
i
looked
round
at
her
anxiously
and
saw
that
she
had
turned
deathly
pale
would
you
rather
go
out
into
the
gallery
i
asked
for
the
room
with
its
tightly
shut
windows
was
close
and
hot
no
she
replied
quietly
i
will
stay
here
i
am
quite
well
but
still
she
kept
hold
of
my
arm
thorndyke
glanced
at
her
keenly
and
then
looked
away
as
norbury
turned
to
ask
him
a
question
why
is
it
think
you
that
some
of
the
teeth
show
so
much
whiter
than
others
i
think
the
whiteness
of
the
shadows
is
due
to
the
presence
of
metal
thorndyke
replied
do
you
mean
that
the
teeth
have
metal
fillings
asked
norbury
yes
really
this
is
very
interesting
the
use
of
gold
stoppings
and
artificial
teeth
too
by
the
ancient
egyptians
is
well
known
but
we
have
no
examples
in
this
museum
this
mummy
ought
to
be
unrolled
do
you
think
all
those
teeth
are
filled
with
the
same
metal
they
are
not
equally
white
no
replied
thorndyke
those
teeth
that
are
perfectly
white
are
undoubtedly
filled
with
gold
but
that
grayish
one
is
probably
filled
with
tin
very
interesting
said
norbury
interesting
and
what
do
you
make
of
that
faint
mark
across
the
chest
near
the
top
of
the
sternum
it
was
ruth
who
answered
his
question
it
is
the
eye
of
osiris
she
exclaimed
in
a
hushed
voice
dear
me
exclaimed
norbury
so
it
is
you
are
quite
right
it
is
the
utchat
the
eye
of
horus
or
osiris
if
you
prefer
to
call
it
so
that
i
presume
will
be
a
gilded
device
on
some
of
the
wrappings
no
i
should
say
it
is
a
tattoo
mark
it
is
too
indefinite
for
a
gilded
device
and
i
should
say
further
that
the
tattooing
is
done
in
vermilion
as
carbon
tattooing
could
cast
no
visible
shadow
i
think
you
must
be
mistaken
about
that
said
norbury
but
we
shall
see
if
the
director
allows
us
to
unroll
the
mummy
by
the
way
those
little
objects
in
front
of
the
knees
are
metallic
i
suppose
yes
they
are
metallic
but
they
are
not
in
front
of
the
knees
they
are
in
the
knees
they
are
pieces
of
silver
wire
which
have
been
used
to
repair
fractured
kneecaps
are
you
sure
of
that
exclaimed
norbury
peering
at
the
little
white
marks
with
ecstasy
because
if
you
are
and
if
these
objects
are
what
you
say
they
are
the
mummy
of
is
an
absolutely
unique
specimen
i
am
quite
certain
of
it
said
thorndyke
then
said
norbury
we
have
made
a
discovery
thanks
to
your
inquiring
spirit
poor
john
bellingham
he
little
knew
what
a
treasure
he
was
giving
us
how
i
wish
he
could
have
known
how
i
wish
he
could
have
been
here
with
us
he
paused
once
more
to
gaze
in
rapture
at
the
photograph
and
then
thorndyke
in
his
quiet
impassive
way
said
john
bellingham
is
here
doctor
norbury
this
is
john
bellingham
norbury
started
back
and
stared
at
thorndyke
in
speechless
amazement
you
do
mean
he
exclaimed
after
a
long
pause
that
this
mummy
is
the
body
of
john
bellingham
i
do
indeed
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
but
it
is
impossible
the
mummy
was
here
in
the
gallery
a
full
three
weeks
before
he
disappeared
not
so
said
thorndyke
john
bellingham
was
last
seen
alive
by
you
and
jellicoe
on
the
fourteenth
of
october
more
than
three
weeks
before
the
mummy
left
queen
square
after
that
date
he
was
never
seen
alive
or
dead
by
any
person
who
knew
him
and
could
identify
him
norbury
reflected
a
while
in
silence
then
in
a
faint
voice
he
asked
how
do
you
suggest
that
john
bellingham
body
came
to
be
inside
that
cartonnage
i
think
jellicoe
is
the
most
likely
person
to
be
able
to
answer
that
question
thorndyke
replied
dryly
there
was
another
interval
of
silence
and
then
norbury
asked
suddenly
but
what
do
you
suppose
has
become
of
the
real
i
mean
i
take
it
said
thorndyke
that
the
remains
of
or
at
least
a
portion
of
them
are
at
present
lying
in
the
woodford
mortuary
awaiting
an
adjourned
inquest
as
thorndyke
made
this
statement
a
flash
of
belated
intelligence
mingled
with
fell
on
me
now
that
the
explanation
was
given
how
obvious
it
was
and
yet
i
a
competent
anatomist
and
physiologist
and
actually
a
pupil
of
thorndyke
had
mistaken
those
ancient
bones
for
the
remains
of
a
recent
body
norbury
considered
the
last
statement
for
some
time
in
evident
perplexity
it
is
all
consistent
enough
i
must
admit
said
he
at
length
and
yet
are
you
quite
sure
there
is
no
mistake
it
seems
so
incredible
there
is
no
mistake
i
assure
you
thorndyke
answered
to
convince
you
i
will
give
you
the
facts
in
detail
first
as
to
the
teeth
i
have
seen
john
bellingham
dentist
and
obtained
particulars
from
his
there
were
in
all
five
teeth
that
had
been
filled
the
right
upper
wisdom
tooth
the
molar
next
to
it
and
the
second
lower
molar
on
the
left
side
had
all
extensive
gold
fillings
you
can
see
them
all
quite
plainly
in
the
skiagraph
the
lower
left
lateral
incisor
had
a
very
small
gold
filling
which
you
can
see
as
a
nearly
circular
white
dot
in
addition
to
these
a
filling
of
tin
amalgam
had
been
inserted
while
the
deceased
was
abroad
in
the
second
left
upper
bicuspid
the
rather
gray
spot
that
we
have
already
noticed
these
would
by
themselves
furnish
ample
means
of
identification
but
in
addition
there
is
the
tattooed
device
of
the
eye
of
osiris
horus
murmured
norbury
horus
then
in
the
exact
locality
in
which
it
was
borne
by
the
deceased
and
tattooed
apparently
with
the
same
pigment
there
are
further
the
suture
wires
in
the
sir
morgan
bennett
having
looked
up
the
notes
of
the
operation
informs
me
that
he
introduced
three
suture
wires
into
the
left
patella
and
two
into
the
right
which
is
what
the
skiagraph
shows
lastly
the
deceased
had
an
old
fracture
on
the
left
side
it
is
not
very
apparent
now
but
i
saw
it
quite
distinctly
just
now
when
the
shadows
of
the
bones
were
whiter
i
think
that
you
make
transcriber
note
may
take
it
that
the
identification
is
beyond
all
doubt
or
question
yes
agreed
norbury
with
gloomy
resignation
it
sounds
as
you
say
quite
conclusive
well
well
it
is
a
most
horrible
affair
poor
old
john
bellingham
it
looks
uncommonly
as
if
he
had
met
with
foul
play
do
you
think
so
i
do
replied
thorndyke
there
was
a
mark
on
the
right
side
of
the
skull
that
looked
rather
like
a
fracture
it
was
not
very
clear
being
at
the
side
but
we
must
develop
the
negative
to
show
it
norbury
drew
his
breath
in
sharply
through
his
teeth
this
is
a
gruesome
business
doctor
said
he
a
terrible
business
awkward
for
our
people
too
by
the
way
what
is
our
position
in
the
matter
what
steps
ought
we
to
take
you
should
give
notice
to
the
coroner
i
will
manage
the
police
and
you
should
communicate
with
one
of
the
executors
of
the
will
mr
jellicoe
no
not
jellicoe
under
the
peculiar
circumstances
you
had
better
write
to
godfrey
bellingham
but
i
rather
understood
that
hurst
was
the
said
norbury
he
is
surely
as
matters
stand
said
jervis
not
at
all
replied
thorndyke
he
as
matters
but
he
is
not
now
you
are
forgetting
the
condition
of
clause
two
that
clause
sets
forth
the
conditions
under
which
godfrey
bellingham
shall
inherit
the
bulk
of
the
estate
and
become
the
and
those
conditions
are
the
body
of
the
testator
shall
be
deposited
in
some
authorized
place
for
the
reception
of
the
bodies
of
the
dead
situate
within
the
boundaries
of
or
appertaining
to
some
place
of
worship
within
the
parish
of
george
bloomsbury
and
giles
in
the
fields
or
andrew
above
the
bars
and
george
the
martyr
now
egyptian
mummies
are
bodies
of
the
dead
and
this
museum
is
an
authorized
place
for
their
reception
and
this
building
is
situate
within
the
boundaries
of
the
parish
of
george
bloomsbury
therefore
the
provisions
of
clause
two
have
been
duly
carried
out
and
therefore
godfrey
bellingham
is
the
principal
beneficiary
under
the
will
and
the
in
accordance
with
the
wishes
of
the
testator
is
that
quite
clear
perfectly
said
norbury
and
a
most
astonishing
coincidence
but
my
dear
young
lady
had
you
not
better
sit
down
you
are
looking
very
he
glanced
anxiously
at
ruth
who
was
pale
to
the
lips
and
was
now
leaning
heavily
on
my
arm
i
think
berkeley
said
thorndyke
you
had
better
take
miss
bellingham
out
into
the
gallery
where
there
is
more
air
this
has
been
a
tremendous
climax
to
all
the
trials
she
has
borne
so
bravely
go
out
with
berkeley
he
added
gently
laying
his
hand
on
her
shoulder
and
sit
down
while
we
develop
the
other
negatives
you
must
break
down
now
you
know
when
the
storm
has
passed
and
the
sun
is
beginning
to
shine
he
held
the
door
open
and
as
we
passed
out
his
face
softened
into
a
smile
of
infinite
kindness
you
wo
mind
my
locking
you
out
said
he
this
is
a
photographic
at
present
the
key
grated
in
the
lock
and
we
turned
away
into
the
dim
gallery
it
was
not
quite
dark
for
a
beam
of
moonlight
filtered
in
here
and
there
through
the
blinds
that
covered
the
skylights
we
walked
on
slowly
her
arm
linked
in
mine
and
for
a
while
neither
of
us
spoke
the
great
rooms
were
very
silent
and
peaceful
and
solemn
the
hush
the
stillness
the
mystery
of
the
forms
in
the
cases
around
were
all
in
harmony
with
the
sense
of
a
great
deliverance
that
filled
our
hearts
we
had
passed
through
into
the
next
room
before
either
of
us
broke
the
silence
insensibly
our
hands
had
crept
together
and
as
they
met
and
clasped
with
mutual
pressure
ruth
exclaimed
how
dreadful
and
tragic
it
is
poor
poor
uncle
john
it
seems
as
if
he
had
come
back
from
the
world
of
shadows
to
tell
us
of
this
awful
thing
but
o
god
what
a
relief
it
is
she
caught
her
breath
in
one
or
two
quick
sobs
and
pressed
my
hand
passionately
it
is
over
dearest
i
said
it
is
gone
for
ever
nothing
remains
but
the
memory
of
your
sorrow
and
your
noble
courage
and
patience
i
ca
realize
it
yet
she
murmured
it
has
been
like
a
frightful
interminable
dream
let
us
put
it
away
said
i
and
think
only
of
the
happy
life
that
is
opening
she
made
no
reply
and
only
a
quick
catch
in
her
breath
now
and
again
told
of
the
long
agony
that
she
had
endured
with
such
heroic
calm
we
walked
on
slowly
scarcely
disturbing
the
silence
with
our
soft
footfalls
through
the
wide
doorway
into
the
second
room
the
vague
shapes
of
standing
erect
in
the
loomed
out
dim
and
gigantic
silent
watchers
keeping
their
vigil
with
the
memories
of
untold
centuries
locked
in
their
shadowy
breasts
they
were
an
awesome
company
reverend
survivors
from
a
vanished
world
they
looked
out
from
the
gloom
of
their
but
with
no
shade
of
menace
or
of
malice
in
their
silent
presence
rather
with
a
solemn
benison
on
the
fleeting
creatures
of
along
the
room
a
ghostly
figure
somewhat
aloof
from
its
companions
showed
a
dim
pallid
blotch
where
its
face
would
have
been
with
one
accord
we
halted
before
it
do
you
know
who
this
is
ruth
i
asked
of
course
i
do
she
answered
it
is
artemidorus
we
stood
hand
in
hand
facing
the
mummy
letting
our
memories
fill
in
the
vague
silhouette
with
its
details
presently
i
drew
her
nearer
to
me
and
whispered
ruth
do
you
remember
when
we
last
stood
here
as
if
i
could
ever
forget
she
answered
passionately
oh
paul
the
sorrow
of
it
the
misery
how
it
wrung
my
heart
to
tell
you
were
you
very
unhappy
when
i
left
you
unhappy
i
never
knew
until
then
what
real
sorrow
was
it
seemed
as
if
the
light
had
gone
out
of
my
life
for
ever
but
there
was
just
one
little
spot
of
brightness
left
what
was
that
you
made
me
a
promise
dear
a
solemn
promise
and
i
felt
at
least
i
hoped
that
the
day
would
come
if
i
only
waited
patiently
when
you
would
be
able
to
redeem
it
she
crept
closer
to
me
and
yet
closer
until
her
head
nestled
on
my
shoulder
and
her
soft
cheek
lay
against
mine
dear
heart
i
whispered
is
it
now
is
the
time
fulfilled
yes
dearest
she
murmured
softly
it
is
now
and
for
ever
reverently
i
folded
her
in
my
arms
gathered
her
to
the
heart
that
worshiped
her
utterly
henceforth
no
sorrows
could
hurt
us
no
misfortune
vex
for
we
should
walk
hand
in
hand
on
our
earthly
pilgrimage
and
find
the
way
all
too
short
time
whose
sands
run
out
with
such
unequal
swiftness
for
the
just
and
the
unjust
the
happy
and
the
wretched
lagged
no
doubt
with
the
toilers
in
the
room
that
we
had
left
but
for
us
its
golden
grains
trickled
out
apace
and
left
the
glass
empty
before
we
had
begun
to
mark
their
passage
the
turning
of
a
key
and
the
opening
of
a
door
aroused
us
from
our
dream
of
perfect
happiness
ruth
raised
her
head
to
listen
and
our
lips
met
for
one
brief
moment
then
with
a
silent
greeting
to
the
friend
who
had
looked
on
our
grief
and
witnessed
our
final
happiness
we
turned
and
retraced
our
steps
quickly
filling
the
great
empty
rooms
with
chattering
echoes
we
wo
go
back
into
the
which
is
dark
now
said
ruth
why
not
i
asked
because
when
i
came
out
i
was
very
pale
and
i
well
i
do
think
i
am
very
pale
now
besides
poor
uncle
john
is
in
there
and
i
should
be
ashamed
to
look
at
him
with
my
selfish
heart
overflowing
with
happiness
you
need
be
said
i
it
is
the
day
of
our
lives
and
we
have
a
right
to
be
happy
but
you
sha
go
in
if
you
do
wish
to
and
i
accordingly
steered
her
adroitly
past
the
beam
of
light
that
streamed
from
the
open
door
we
have
developed
four
negatives
said
thorndyke
as
he
emerged
with
the
others
and
i
am
leaving
them
in
the
custody
of
doctor
norbury
who
will
sign
each
when
they
are
dry
as
they
may
have
to
be
put
in
evidence
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
looked
at
ruth
to
see
what
she
wished
if
you
wo
think
me
ungrateful
said
she
i
should
rather
be
alone
with
my
father
he
is
very
weak
and
yes
i
understand
i
said
hastily
and
i
did
bellingham
was
a
man
of
strong
emotions
and
would
probably
be
somewhat
overcome
by
the
sudden
change
of
fortune
and
the
news
of
his
brother
tragic
death
in
that
case
said
thorndyke
i
will
bespeak
your
services
will
you
go
on
and
wait
for
me
at
my
chambers
when
you
have
seen
miss
bellingham
home
i
agreed
to
this
and
we
set
forth
under
the
guidance
of
norbury
who
carried
an
electric
lamp
to
return
by
the
way
we
had
come
two
of
us
as
least
in
a
vastly
different
frame
of
mind
the
party
broke
up
at
the
entrance
gates
and
as
thorndyke
wished
my
companion
she
held
his
hand
and
looked
up
in
his
face
with
swimming
eyes
i
have
thanked
you
doctor
thorndyke
she
said
and
i
do
feel
that
i
ever
can
what
you
have
done
for
me
and
my
father
is
beyond
all
thanks
you
have
saved
his
life
and
you
have
rescued
me
from
the
most
horrible
ignominy
and
god
bless
you
the
hansom
that
bowled
along
eastward
at
most
unnecessary
speed
bore
two
of
the
happiest
human
beings
within
the
wide
boundaries
of
the
town
i
looked
at
my
companion
as
the
lights
of
the
street
shone
into
the
cab
and
was
astonished
at
the
transformation
the
pallor
of
her
cheek
had
given
place
to
a
rosy
pink
the
hardness
the
tension
the
haggard
that
had
aged
her
face
were
all
gone
and
the
girlish
sweetness
that
had
so
bewitched
me
in
the
early
days
of
our
love
had
stolen
back
even
the
dimple
was
there
when
the
sweeping
lashes
lifted
and
her
eyes
met
mine
in
a
smile
of
infinite
tenderness
little
was
said
on
that
brief
journey
it
was
happiness
enough
to
sit
hand
clasped
in
hand
and
know
that
our
time
of
trial
was
past
that
no
cross
of
fate
could
ever
part
us
now
the
astonished
cabman
set
us
down
according
to
instructions
at
the
entrance
to
nevill
court
and
watched
us
with
open
mouth
as
we
vanished
into
the
narrow
passage
the
court
had
settled
down
for
the
night
and
no
one
marked
our
return
no
curious
eye
looked
down
on
us
from
the
dark
as
we
said
just
inside
the
gate
you
will
come
and
see
us
dear
wo
you
she
asked
do
you
think
it
possible
that
i
could
stay
away
then
i
hope
not
but
come
as
early
as
you
can
my
father
will
be
positively
frantic
to
see
you
because
i
shall
have
told
him
you
know
and
remember
that
it
is
you
who
have
brought
us
this
great
deliverance
paul
sweetheart
she
put
up
her
face
frankly
to
be
kissed
and
then
ran
up
to
the
ancient
door
whence
she
waved
me
a
last
the
shabby
gate
in
the
wall
closed
behind
me
and
hid
her
from
my
sight
but
the
light
of
her
love
went
with
me
and
turned
the
dull
street
into
a
path
of
glory
chapter
xix
a
strange
symposium
it
came
upon
me
with
something
of
a
shock
of
surprise
to
find
the
scrap
of
paper
still
tacked
to
the
oak
of
thorndyke
chambers
so
much
had
happened
since
i
had
last
looked
on
it
that
it
seemed
to
belong
to
another
epoch
of
my
life
i
removed
it
thoughtfully
and
picked
out
the
tack
before
entering
and
then
closing
the
inner
door
but
leaving
the
oak
open
i
lit
the
gas
and
fell
to
pacing
the
room
what
a
wonderful
episode
it
had
been
how
the
whole
aspect
of
the
world
had
been
changed
in
a
moment
by
thorndyke
revelation
at
another
time
curiosity
would
have
led
me
to
endeavor
to
trace
back
the
train
of
reasoning
by
which
the
subtle
brain
of
my
teacher
had
attained
this
astonishing
conclusion
but
now
my
own
happiness
held
exclusive
possession
of
my
thoughts
the
image
of
ruth
filled
the
field
of
my
mental
vision
i
saw
her
again
as
i
had
seen
her
in
the
cab
with
her
sweet
pensive
face
and
downcast
eyes
i
felt
again
the
touch
of
her
soft
cheek
and
the
parting
kiss
by
the
gate
so
frank
and
simple
so
intimate
and
final
i
must
have
waited
quite
a
long
time
though
the
golden
minutes
sped
unreckoned
for
when
my
two
colleagues
arrived
they
tendered
needless
apologies
and
i
suppose
said
thorndyke
you
have
been
wondering
what
i
wanted
you
for
i
had
not
as
a
matter
of
fact
given
the
matter
a
consideration
we
are
going
to
call
on
jellicoe
thorndyke
explained
there
is
something
behind
this
affair
and
until
i
have
ascertained
what
it
is
the
case
is
not
complete
from
my
point
of
view
would
it
have
done
as
well
i
asked
it
might
and
then
it
might
not
there
is
an
old
saying
as
to
catching
a
weasel
asleep
jellicoe
is
a
somewhat
person
and
i
think
it
best
to
introduce
him
to
inspector
badger
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
the
meeting
of
a
weasel
and
a
badger
suggests
a
sporting
interview
remarked
jervis
but
you
do
expect
jellicoe
to
give
himself
away
do
you
he
can
hardly
do
that
seeing
that
there
is
nothing
to
give
away
but
i
think
he
may
make
a
statement
there
were
some
exceptional
circumstances
i
feel
sure
how
long
have
you
known
that
the
body
was
in
the
museum
i
asked
about
thirty
or
forty
seconds
longer
than
you
have
i
should
say
do
you
mean
i
exclaimed
that
you
did
not
know
until
the
negative
was
developed
my
dear
fellow
he
replied
do
you
suppose
that
if
i
had
had
certain
knowledge
where
the
body
was
i
should
have
allowed
that
noble
girl
to
go
on
dragging
out
a
lingering
agony
of
suspense
that
i
could
have
cut
short
in
a
moment
or
that
i
should
have
made
these
humbugging
pretenses
of
scientific
experiments
if
a
more
dignified
course
had
been
open
to
me
as
to
the
experiments
said
jervis
norbury
could
hardly
have
refused
if
you
had
taken
him
into
your
confidence
indeed
he
could
and
probably
would
my
would
have
involved
a
charge
of
murder
against
a
highly
respectable
gentleman
who
was
well
known
to
him
he
would
probably
have
referred
me
to
the
police
and
then
what
could
i
have
done
i
had
plenty
of
suspicions
but
not
a
single
solid
fact
our
discussion
was
here
interrupted
by
hurried
footsteps
on
the
stairs
and
a
thundering
on
our
knocker
as
jervis
opened
the
door
inspector
badger
burst
into
the
room
in
a
highly
excited
state
what
is
all
this
doctor
thorndyke
he
asked
i
see
you
sworn
an
information
against
jellicoe
and
i
have
a
warrant
to
arrest
him
but
before
anything
else
is
done
i
think
it
right
to
tell
you
that
we
have
more
evidence
than
is
generally
known
pointing
to
quite
a
different
quarter
derived
from
jellicoe
information
said
thorndyke
but
the
fact
is
that
i
have
just
examined
and
identified
the
body
at
the
british
museum
where
it
was
deposited
by
jellicoe
i
do
say
that
he
murdered
john
bellingham
though
that
is
what
appearances
suggest
but
i
do
say
that
he
will
have
to
account
for
his
secret
disposal
of
the
body
inspector
badger
was
thunderstruck
also
he
was
visibly
annoyed
the
salt
which
jellicoe
had
so
adroitly
sprinkled
on
the
constabulary
tail
appeared
to
develop
irritating
properties
for
when
thorndyke
had
given
him
a
brief
outline
of
the
facts
he
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
exclaimed
gloomily
well
i
hanged
and
to
think
of
all
the
time
and
trouble
i
spent
on
those
damned
bones
i
suppose
they
were
just
a
plant
do
let
us
disparage
them
said
thorndyke
they
have
played
a
useful
part
they
represent
the
inevitable
mistake
that
every
criminal
makes
sooner
or
later
the
murderer
will
always
do
a
little
too
much
if
he
would
only
lie
low
and
let
well
alone
the
detectives
might
whistle
for
a
clue
but
it
is
time
we
are
starting
are
we
all
going
asked
the
inspector
looking
at
me
in
particular
with
no
very
gracious
recognition
we
will
all
come
with
you
said
thorndyke
but
you
will
naturally
make
the
arrest
in
the
way
that
seems
best
to
you
it
a
regular
procession
grumbled
the
inspector
but
he
made
no
more
definite
objection
and
we
started
forth
on
our
quest
the
distance
from
the
temple
to
lincoln
inn
is
not
great
in
five
minutes
we
were
at
the
gateway
in
chancery
lane
and
a
couple
of
minutes
later
saw
us
gathered
round
the
threshold
of
the
stately
old
house
in
new
square
seems
to
be
a
light
in
the
front
said
badger
better
move
away
before
i
ring
the
bell
but
the
precaution
was
unnecessary
as
the
inspector
advanced
to
the
a
head
was
thrust
out
of
the
open
window
immediately
above
the
street
door
who
are
you
inquired
the
owner
of
the
head
in
a
voice
which
i
recognized
as
that
of
jellicoe
i
am
inspector
badger
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
i
wish
to
see
arthur
jellicoe
then
look
at
me
i
am
arthur
jellicoe
i
hold
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
jellicoe
you
are
charged
with
the
murder
of
john
bellingham
whose
body
has
been
discovered
in
the
british
museum
by
whom
by
doctor
thorndyke
indeed
said
jellicoe
is
he
here
yes
ha
and
you
wish
to
arrest
me
i
presume
yes
that
is
what
i
am
here
for
well
i
will
agree
to
surrender
myself
subject
to
certain
conditions
i
ca
make
any
conditions
mr
jellicoe
no
i
will
make
them
and
you
will
accept
them
otherwise
you
will
not
arrest
me
it
no
use
for
you
to
talk
like
that
said
badger
if
you
let
me
in
i
shall
have
to
break
in
and
i
may
as
well
tell
you
he
added
mendaciously
that
the
house
is
surrounded
you
may
accept
my
assurance
jellicoe
replied
calmly
that
you
will
not
arrest
me
if
you
do
not
accept
my
conditions
well
what
are
you
conditions
demanded
badger
i
desire
to
make
a
statement
said
jellicoe
you
can
do
that
but
i
must
caution
you
that
anything
you
say
may
be
used
in
evidence
against
you
naturally
but
i
wish
to
make
the
statement
in
the
presence
of
doctor
thorndyke
and
i
desire
to
hear
a
statement
from
him
of
the
method
of
investigation
by
which
he
discovered
the
whereabouts
of
the
body
that
is
to
say
if
he
is
willing
if
you
mean
that
we
should
mutually
enlighten
one
another
i
am
very
willing
indeed
said
thorndyke
very
well
then
my
conditions
inspector
are
that
i
shall
hear
doctor
thorndyke
statement
and
that
i
shall
be
permitted
to
make
a
statement
myself
and
that
until
those
statements
are
completed
with
any
necessary
interrogation
and
discussion
i
shall
remain
at
liberty
and
shall
suffer
no
molestation
or
interference
of
any
kind
and
i
agree
that
on
the
conclusion
of
the
said
proceedings
i
will
submit
without
resistance
to
any
course
that
you
may
adopt
i
ca
agree
to
that
said
badger
ca
you
said
jellicoe
coldly
and
after
a
pause
he
added
do
be
hasty
i
have
given
you
warning
there
was
something
in
jellicoe
passionless
tone
that
disturbed
the
inspector
exceedingly
for
he
turned
to
thorndyke
and
said
in
a
low
tone
i
wonder
what
his
game
is
he
ca
get
away
you
know
there
are
several
possibilities
said
thorndyke
said
badger
stroking
his
chin
perplexedly
after
all
is
there
any
objection
his
statement
might
save
trouble
and
you
be
on
the
safe
side
it
would
take
you
some
time
to
break
in
well
said
jellicoe
with
his
hand
on
the
window
do
you
agree
yes
or
no
all
right
said
badger
sulkily
i
agree
you
promise
not
to
molest
me
in
any
way
until
i
have
quite
finished
i
promise
jellicoe
head
disappeared
and
the
window
closed
after
a
short
pause
we
heard
the
jar
of
massive
bolts
and
the
clank
of
a
chain
and
as
the
heavy
door
swung
open
jellicoe
stood
revealed
calm
and
impassive
with
an
office
candlestick
in
his
hand
who
are
the
others
he
inquired
peering
out
sharply
through
his
spectacles
oh
they
are
nothing
to
do
with
me
replied
badger
they
are
doctor
berkeley
and
doctor
jervis
said
thorndyke
ha
said
jellicoe
very
kind
and
attentive
of
them
to
call
pray
come
in
gentlemen
i
am
sure
you
will
be
interested
to
hear
our
little
discussion
he
held
the
door
open
with
a
certain
stiff
courtesy
and
we
all
entered
the
hall
led
by
inspector
badger
he
closed
the
door
softly
and
preceded
us
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
apartment
from
the
window
of
which
he
had
dictated
the
terms
of
surrender
it
was
a
fine
old
room
spacious
lofty
and
dignified
with
paneled
walls
and
a
carved
mantelpiece
the
central
escutcheon
of
which
bore
the
initials
with
the
date
a
large
stood
at
the
farther
end
and
behind
it
was
an
iron
safe
i
have
been
expecting
this
visit
jellicoe
remarked
tranquilly
as
he
placed
four
chairs
opposite
the
table
since
when
asked
thorndyke
since
last
monday
evening
when
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
conversing
with
my
friend
doctor
berkeley
at
the
inner
temple
gate
and
then
inferred
that
you
were
retained
in
the
case
that
was
a
circumstance
that
had
not
been
fully
provided
for
may
i
offer
you
gentlemen
a
glass
of
sherry
as
he
spoke
he
placed
on
the
table
a
decanter
and
a
tray
of
glasses
and
looked
at
us
interrogatively
with
his
hand
on
the
stopper
well
i
do
mind
if
i
do
jellicoe
said
badger
on
whom
the
lawyer
glance
had
finally
settled
jellicoe
filled
a
glass
and
handed
it
to
him
with
a
stiff
bow
then
with
the
decanter
still
in
his
hand
he
said
persuasively
doctor
thorndyke
pray
allow
me
to
fill
you
a
glass
no
thank
you
said
thorndyke
in
a
tone
so
decided
that
the
inspector
looked
round
at
him
quickly
and
as
badger
caught
his
eye
the
glass
which
he
was
about
to
raise
to
his
lips
became
suddenly
arrested
and
was
slowly
returned
to
the
table
untasted
i
do
want
to
hurry
you
jellicoe
said
the
inspector
but
it
rather
late
and
i
should
like
to
get
this
business
settled
what
is
it
that
you
wish
to
do
i
desire
replied
jellicoe
to
make
a
detailed
statement
of
the
events
that
have
happened
and
i
wish
to
hear
from
doctor
thorndyke
precisely
how
he
arrived
at
his
very
remarkable
conclusion
when
this
has
been
done
i
shall
be
entirely
at
your
service
and
i
suggest
that
it
would
be
more
interesting
if
doctor
thorndyke
would
give
us
his
statement
before
i
furnish
you
with
the
actual
facts
i
am
entirely
of
your
opinion
said
thorndyke
then
in
that
case
said
jellicoe
i
suggest
that
you
disregard
me
and
address
your
remarks
to
your
friends
as
if
i
were
not
present
thorndyke
acquiesced
with
a
bow
and
jellicoe
having
seated
himself
in
his
behind
the
table
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
water
selected
a
cigarette
from
a
neat
silver
case
lighted
it
deliberately
and
leaned
back
to
listen
at
his
ease
my
first
acquaintance
with
this
case
thorndyke
began
without
preamble
was
made
through
the
medium
of
the
daily
papers
about
two
years
ago
and
i
may
say
that
although
i
had
no
interest
in
it
beyond
the
purely
academic
interest
of
a
specialist
in
a
case
that
lies
in
his
particular
specialty
i
considered
it
with
deep
attention
the
newspaper
reports
contained
no
particulars
of
the
relations
of
the
parties
that
could
furnish
any
hints
as
to
motives
on
the
part
of
any
of
them
but
merely
a
bare
statement
of
the
events
and
this
was
a
distinct
advantage
inasmuch
as
it
left
one
to
consider
the
facts
of
the
case
without
regard
to
motive
to
balance
the
probabilities
with
an
open
mind
and
it
may
surprize
you
to
learn
that
those
probabilities
pointed
from
the
very
first
to
that
solution
which
has
been
put
to
the
test
of
experiment
this
evening
hence
it
will
be
well
for
me
to
begin
by
giving
the
conclusions
that
i
reached
by
reasoning
from
the
facts
set
forth
in
the
newspapers
before
any
of
the
further
facts
came
to
my
knowledge
from
the
facts
as
stated
in
the
newspaper
reports
it
is
obvious
that
there
were
four
possible
explanations
of
the
disappearance
the
man
might
be
alive
and
in
hiding
this
was
highly
improbable
for
the
reasons
that
were
stated
by
loram
at
the
late
hearing
of
the
application
and
for
a
further
reason
that
i
shall
mention
presently
he
might
have
died
by
accident
or
disease
and
his
body
failed
to
be
identified
this
was
even
more
improbable
seeing
that
he
carried
on
his
person
abundant
means
of
identification
including
visiting
cards
he
might
have
been
murdered
by
some
stranger
for
the
sake
of
his
portable
property
this
was
highly
improbable
for
the
same
reason
his
body
could
hardly
have
failed
to
be
identified
these
three
explanations
are
what
we
may
call
the
outside
explanations
they
touched
none
of
the
parties
mentioned
they
were
all
obviously
improbable
on
general
grounds
and
to
all
of
them
there
was
one
conclusive
answer
the
scarab
which
was
found
in
godfrey
bellingham
garden
hence
i
put
them
aside
and
gave
my
attention
to
the
fourth
explanation
this
was
that
the
missing
man
had
been
made
away
with
by
one
of
the
parties
mentioned
in
the
report
but
since
the
reports
mentioned
three
parties
it
was
evident
that
there
was
a
choice
of
three
hypotheses
namely
that
john
bellingham
had
been
made
away
with
by
hurst
or
by
the
bellinghams
or
by
jellicoe
now
i
have
constantly
impressed
on
my
pupils
that
the
indispensable
question
that
must
be
asked
at
the
outset
of
such
an
inquiry
as
this
is
was
the
missing
person
last
undoubtedly
seen
or
known
to
be
alive
that
is
the
question
that
i
asked
myself
after
reading
the
newspaper
report
and
the
answer
was
that
he
was
last
certainly
seen
alive
on
the
fourteenth
of
october
nineteen
hundred
and
two
at
queen
square
bloomsbury
of
the
fact
that
he
was
alive
at
that
time
and
place
there
could
be
no
doubt
whatever
for
he
was
seen
at
the
same
moment
by
two
persons
both
of
whom
were
intimately
acquainted
with
him
and
one
of
whom
doctor
norbury
was
apparently
a
disinterested
witness
after
that
date
he
was
never
seen
alive
or
dead
by
any
person
who
knew
him
and
was
able
to
identify
him
it
was
stated
that
he
had
been
seen
on
the
of
november
following
by
the
housemaid
of
hurst
but
as
this
person
was
unacquainted
with
him
it
was
uncertain
whether
the
person
whom
she
saw
was
or
was
not
john
bellingham
hence
the
disappearance
dated
not
from
the
of
november
as
every
one
seems
to
have
assumed
but
from
the
fourteenth
of
october
and
the
question
was
not
became
of
john
bellingham
after
he
entered
hurst
house
but
became
of
him
after
his
interview
in
queen
square
but
as
soon
as
i
had
decided
that
that
interview
must
form
the
real
starting
point
of
the
inquiry
a
most
striking
set
of
circumstances
came
into
view
it
became
obvious
that
if
jellicoe
had
had
any
reason
for
wishing
to
make
away
with
john
bellingham
he
had
such
an
opportunity
as
seldom
falls
to
the
lot
of
an
intending
murderer
just
consider
the
conditions
john
bellingham
was
known
to
be
setting
out
alone
upon
a
journey
beyond
the
sea
his
exact
destination
was
not
stated
he
was
to
be
absent
for
an
undetermined
period
but
at
least
three
weeks
his
disappearance
would
occasion
no
comment
his
absence
would
lead
to
no
inquiries
at
least
for
several
weeks
during
which
the
murderer
would
have
leisure
quietly
to
dispose
of
the
body
and
conceal
all
traces
of
the
crime
the
conditions
were
from
a
murderer
point
of
view
ideal
but
that
was
not
all
during
that
very
period
of
john
absence
jellicoe
was
engaged
to
deliver
to
the
british
museum
what
was
admittedly
a
dead
human
body
and
that
body
was
to
be
enclosed
in
a
sealed
case
could
any
more
perfect
or
secure
method
of
disposing
of
a
body
be
devised
by
the
most
ingenious
murderer
the
plan
would
have
had
only
one
weak
point
the
mummy
would
be
known
to
have
left
queen
square
the
disappearance
of
john
bellingham
and
suspicion
might
in
the
end
have
arisen
to
this
point
i
shall
return
presently
meanwhile
we
will
consider
the
second
hypothesis
that
the
missing
man
was
made
away
with
by
hurst
now
there
seemed
to
be
no
doubt
that
some
person
purporting
to
be
john
bellingham
did
actually
visit
hurst
house
and
he
must
either
have
left
the
house
or
remained
in
it
if
he
left
he
did
so
surreptitiously
if
he
remained
there
could
be
no
reasonable
doubt
that
he
had
been
murdered
and
that
his
body
had
been
concealed
let
us
consider
the
probabilities
in
each
case
assuming
as
every
one
seems
to
have
done
that
the
visitor
was
really
john
bellingham
we
are
dealing
with
a
responsible
gentleman
and
the
idea
that
such
a
person
would
enter
a
house
announce
his
intention
of
staying
and
then
steal
away
unobserved
is
very
difficult
to
accept
moreover
he
would
appear
to
have
come
down
to
eltham
by
rail
immediately
on
landing
in
england
leaving
his
luggage
in
the
cloakroom
at
charing
cross
this
pointed
to
a
definiteness
of
purpose
quite
inconsistent
with
his
casual
disappearance
from
the
house
on
the
other
hand
the
idea
that
he
might
have
been
murdered
by
hurst
was
not
inconceivable
the
thing
was
physically
possible
if
bellingham
had
really
been
in
the
study
when
hurst
came
home
the
murder
could
have
been
committed
by
appropriate
means
and
the
body
temporarily
concealed
in
the
cupboard
or
elsewhere
but
although
possible
it
was
not
at
all
probable
there
was
no
real
opportunity
the
risk
and
the
subsequent
difficulties
would
be
very
great
there
was
not
a
particle
of
positive
evidence
that
a
murder
had
occurred
and
the
conduct
of
hurst
in
immediately
leaving
the
house
in
possession
of
the
servants
is
quite
inconsistent
with
the
supposition
that
there
was
a
body
concealed
in
it
so
that
while
it
is
almost
impossible
to
believe
that
john
bellingham
left
the
house
of
his
own
accord
it
is
equally
difficult
to
believe
that
he
did
not
leave
it
but
there
is
a
third
possibility
which
strange
to
say
no
one
seems
to
have
suggested
supposing
that
the
visitor
was
not
john
bellingham
at
all
but
some
one
who
was
impersonating
him
that
would
dispose
of
the
difficulties
completely
the
strange
disappearance
ceases
to
be
strange
for
a
personator
would
necessarily
make
off
before
hurst
should
arrive
and
discover
the
imposture
but
if
we
accept
this
supposition
we
raise
two
further
questions
was
the
personator
and
was
the
object
of
the
personation
now
the
personator
was
clearly
not
hurst
himself
for
he
would
have
been
recognized
by
his
housemaid
he
was
therefore
either
godfrey
bellingham
or
jellicoe
or
some
other
person
and
as
no
other
person
was
mentioned
in
the
newspaper
reports
i
confined
my
speculations
to
these
two
and
first
as
to
godfrey
bellingham
it
did
not
appear
whether
he
was
or
was
not
known
to
the
housemaid
so
i
assumed
wrongly
as
it
turns
out
that
he
was
not
then
he
might
have
been
the
personator
but
why
should
he
have
personated
his
brother
he
could
not
have
already
committed
the
murder
there
had
not
been
time
enough
he
would
have
had
to
leave
woodford
before
john
bellingham
had
set
out
for
charing
cross
and
even
if
he
had
committed
the
murder
he
would
have
no
object
in
raising
this
commotion
his
cue
would
have
been
to
remain
quiet
and
know
nothing
the
probabilities
were
all
against
the
personator
being
godfrey
bellingham
then
could
it
be
jellicoe
the
answer
to
this
question
is
contained
in
the
answer
to
the
further
question
could
have
been
the
object
of
the
personation
what
motive
could
this
unknown
person
have
had
in
appearing
announcing
himself
as
john
bellingham
and
forthwith
vanishing
there
could
only
have
been
one
motive
that
namely
of
fixing
the
date
of
john
bellingham
disappearance
of
furnishing
a
definite
moment
at
which
he
was
last
seen
alive
but
who
was
likely
to
have
had
such
a
motive
let
us
see
i
said
just
now
that
if
jellicoe
had
murdered
john
bellingham
and
disposed
of
the
body
in
the
he
would
have
been
absolutely
safe
for
the
time
being
but
there
would
be
a
weak
spot
in
his
armor
for
a
month
or
more
the
disappearance
of
his
client
would
occasion
no
remark
but
presently
when
he
failed
to
return
inquiries
would
be
set
on
foot
and
then
it
would
appear
that
no
one
had
seen
him
since
he
left
queen
square
then
it
would
be
noted
that
the
last
person
with
whom
he
was
seen
was
jellicoe
it
might
further
be
remembered
that
the
mummy
had
been
delivered
to
the
museum
some
time
the
missing
man
was
last
seen
alive
and
so
suspicion
might
arise
and
be
followed
by
disastrous
investigations
but
supposing
it
should
be
made
to
appear
that
john
bellingham
had
been
seen
alive
more
than
a
month
after
his
interview
with
jellicoe
and
some
weeks
after
the
mummy
had
been
deposited
in
the
museum
then
jellicoe
would
cease
to
be
in
any
way
connected
with
the
disappearance
and
henceforth
would
be
absolutely
safe
hence
after
carefully
considering
this
part
of
the
newspaper
report
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
mysterious
occurrence
at
house
had
only
one
reasonable
explanation
namely
that
the
visitor
was
not
john
bellingham
but
some
one
personating
him
and
that
that
some
one
was
jellicoe
it
remains
to
consider
the
case
of
godfrey
bellingham
and
his
daughter
though
i
can
not
understand
how
any
sane
person
can
have
seriously
suspected
either
here
inspector
badger
smiled
a
sour
smile
the
evidence
against
them
was
negligible
for
there
was
nothing
to
connect
them
with
the
affair
save
the
finding
of
the
scarab
on
their
premises
and
that
event
which
might
have
been
highly
suspicious
under
other
circumstances
was
robbed
of
any
significance
by
the
fact
that
the
scarab
was
found
on
a
spot
which
had
been
passed
a
few
minutes
previously
by
the
other
suspected
party
hurst
the
finding
of
the
scarab
did
however
establish
two
important
conclusions
namely
that
john
bellingham
had
probably
met
with
foul
play
and
that
of
the
four
persons
present
when
it
was
found
one
at
least
had
had
possession
of
the
body
as
to
which
of
the
four
was
the
one
the
circumstances
furnished
only
a
hint
which
was
this
if
the
scarab
had
been
purposely
dropped
the
most
likely
person
to
find
it
was
the
one
who
dropped
it
and
the
person
who
discovered
it
was
jellicoe
following
up
this
hint
if
we
ask
ourselves
what
motive
jellicoe
could
have
had
for
dropping
it
assuming
him
to
be
the
murderer
the
answer
is
obvious
it
would
not
be
his
policy
to
fix
the
crime
on
any
particular
person
but
rather
to
set
up
a
complication
of
conflicting
evidence
which
would
occupy
the
attention
of
investigators
and
divert
it
from
himself
of
course
if
hurst
had
been
the
murderer
he
would
have
had
a
sufficient
motive
for
dropping
the
scarab
so
that
the
case
against
jellicoe
was
not
conclusive
but
the
fact
that
it
was
he
who
found
it
was
highly
significant
this
completes
the
analysis
of
the
evidence
contained
in
the
original
newspaper
report
describing
the
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
the
conclusions
that
followed
from
it
were
as
you
will
have
seen
that
the
missing
man
was
almost
certainly
dead
as
proved
by
the
finding
of
the
scarab
after
his
disappearance
that
he
had
probably
been
murdered
by
one
or
more
of
four
persons
as
proved
by
the
finding
of
the
scarab
on
the
premises
occupied
by
two
of
them
and
accessible
to
the
others
that
of
those
four
persons
one
jellicoe
was
the
last
person
who
was
known
to
have
been
in
the
company
of
the
missing
man
had
had
an
exceptional
opportunity
for
committing
the
murder
and
was
known
to
have
delivered
a
dead
body
to
the
museum
subsequently
to
the
disappearance
that
the
supposition
that
jellicoe
had
committed
the
murder
rendered
all
the
other
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
clearly
intelligible
whereas
on
any
other
supposition
they
were
quite
inexplicable
the
evidence
of
the
newspaper
report
therefore
clearly
pointed
to
the
probability
that
john
bellingham
had
been
murdered
by
jellicoe
and
his
body
concealed
in
the
i
do
not
wish
to
give
you
the
impression
that
i
then
and
there
believed
that
jellicoe
was
the
murderer
i
did
not
there
was
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
report
contained
all
the
essential
facts
and
i
merely
considered
it
speculatively
as
a
study
in
probabilities
but
i
did
decide
that
that
was
the
only
probable
conclusion
from
the
facts
that
were
given
nearly
two
years
had
passed
before
i
heard
anything
more
of
the
case
then
it
was
brought
to
my
notice
by
my
friend
doctor
berkeley
and
i
became
acquainted
with
certain
new
facts
which
i
will
consider
in
the
order
in
which
they
became
known
to
me
the
first
new
light
on
the
case
came
from
the
will
as
soon
as
i
had
read
the
document
i
felt
convinced
that
there
was
something
wrong
the
testator
evident
intention
was
that
his
brother
should
inherit
the
property
whereas
the
construction
of
the
will
was
such
as
almost
certainly
to
defeat
that
intention
the
devolution
of
the
property
depended
on
the
burial
clause
clause
two
but
the
burial
arrangement
would
ordinarily
be
decided
by
the
executor
who
happened
to
be
jellicoe
thus
the
will
left
the
disposition
of
the
property
under
the
control
of
jellicoe
though
his
action
could
have
been
contested
now
this
will
although
drawn
up
by
john
bellingham
was
executed
in
jellicoe
office
as
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
it
was
witnessed
by
two
of
his
clerks
he
was
the
testator
lawyer
and
it
was
his
duty
to
insist
on
the
will
being
properly
drawn
evidently
he
did
nothing
of
the
kind
and
this
fact
strongly
suggested
some
kind
of
collusion
on
his
part
with
hurst
who
stood
to
benefit
by
the
miscarriage
of
the
will
and
this
was
the
odd
feature
in
the
case
for
whereas
the
party
responsible
for
the
defective
provisions
was
jellicoe
the
party
who
benefited
was
hurst
but
the
most
startling
peculiarity
of
the
will
was
the
way
in
which
it
fitted
the
circumstances
of
the
disappearance
it
looked
as
if
clause
two
had
been
drawn
up
with
those
very
circumstances
in
view
since
however
the
will
was
ten
years
old
this
was
impossible
but
if
clause
two
could
not
have
been
devised
to
fit
the
disappearance
could
the
disappearance
not
have
been
devised
to
fit
clause
two
that
was
by
no
means
impossible
under
the
circumstances
it
looked
rather
probable
and
if
it
had
been
so
contrived
who
was
the
agent
in
that
contrivance
hurst
stood
to
benefit
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
even
knew
the
contents
of
the
will
there
only
remained
jellicoe
who
had
certainly
connived
at
the
misdrawing
of
the
will
for
some
purpose
of
his
own
some
dishonest
purpose
the
evidence
of
the
will
then
pointed
to
jellicoe
as
the
agent
in
the
disappearance
and
after
reading
it
i
definitely
suspected
him
of
the
crime
suspicion
however
is
one
thing
and
proof
is
another
i
had
not
nearly
enough
evidence
to
justify
me
in
laying
an
information
and
i
could
not
approach
the
museum
officials
without
making
a
definite
accusation
the
great
difficulty
of
the
case
was
that
i
could
discover
no
motive
i
could
not
see
any
way
in
which
jellicoe
would
benefit
by
the
disappearance
his
own
legacy
was
secure
whenever
and
however
the
testator
died
the
murder
and
concealment
apparently
benefited
hurst
alone
and
in
the
absence
of
any
plausible
motive
the
facts
required
to
be
much
more
conclusive
than
they
were
did
you
form
absolutely
no
opinion
as
to
motive
asked
jellicoe
he
put
the
question
in
a
quiet
passionless
tone
as
if
he
were
discussing
some
in
which
he
had
nothing
more
than
a
professional
interest
indeed
the
calm
impersonal
interest
that
he
displayed
in
thorndyke
analysis
his
unmoved
attention
punctuated
by
little
nods
of
approval
at
each
telling
point
in
the
argument
were
the
most
surprising
features
of
this
astounding
interview
i
did
form
an
opinion
replied
thorndyke
but
it
was
merely
speculative
and
i
was
never
able
to
confirm
it
i
discovered
that
about
ten
years
ago
hurst
had
been
in
difficulties
and
that
he
had
suddenly
raised
a
considerable
sum
of
money
no
one
knew
how
or
on
what
security
i
observed
that
this
even
coincided
with
the
execution
of
the
will
and
i
surmised
that
there
might
be
some
connection
between
them
but
that
was
only
a
surmise
and
as
the
proverb
has
it
discovers
who
proves
i
could
prove
nothing
so
that
i
never
discovered
jellicoe
motive
and
i
do
know
it
now
do
you
really
said
jellicoe
in
something
approaching
a
tone
of
animation
he
laid
down
the
end
of
his
cigarette
and
as
he
selected
another
from
the
silver
case
he
continued
i
think
that
is
the
most
interesting
feature
of
your
really
remarkable
analysis
it
does
you
great
credit
the
absence
of
motive
would
have
appeared
to
most
persons
a
fatal
objection
to
the
theory
of
what
i
may
call
the
prosecution
permit
me
to
congratulate
you
on
the
consistency
and
tenacity
with
which
you
have
pursued
the
actual
visible
facts
he
bowed
stiffly
to
thorndyke
who
returned
his
bow
with
equal
stiffness
lighted
a
fresh
cigarette
and
once
more
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
the
calm
attentive
manner
of
a
man
who
is
listening
to
a
lecture
or
a
musical
performance
the
evidence
then
being
insufficient
to
act
upon
thorndyke
resumed
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
wait
for
some
new
facts
now
the
study
of
a
large
series
of
carefully
conducted
murders
brings
into
view
an
almost
invariable
phenomenon
the
cautious
murderer
in
his
anxiety
to
make
himself
secure
does
too
much
and
it
is
this
excess
of
precaution
that
leads
to
detection
it
happens
constantly
indeed
i
may
say
that
it
always
happens
in
those
murders
that
are
detected
of
those
that
are
not
we
say
nothing
and
i
had
strong
hopes
that
it
would
happen
in
this
case
and
it
did
at
the
very
moment
when
my
client
case
seemed
almost
hopeless
some
human
remains
were
discovered
at
sidcup
i
read
the
account
of
the
discovery
in
the
evening
paper
and
scanty
as
the
report
was
it
recorded
enough
facts
to
convince
me
that
the
inevitable
mistake
had
been
made
did
it
indeed
said
jellicoe
a
mere
inexpert
hearsay
report
i
should
have
supposed
it
to
be
quite
valueless
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
so
it
was
said
thorndyke
but
it
gave
the
date
of
the
discovery
and
the
locality
and
it
also
mentioned
what
bones
had
been
found
which
were
all
vital
facts
take
the
question
of
time
these
remains
after
lying
for
two
years
suddenly
come
to
light
just
as
the
parties
who
have
also
been
lying
have
begun
to
take
action
in
respect
of
the
will
in
fact
within
a
week
or
two
of
the
hearing
of
the
application
it
was
certainly
a
remarkable
coincidence
and
when
the
circumstances
that
occasioned
the
discovery
were
considered
the
coincidence
became
more
remarkable
still
for
these
remains
were
found
on
land
actually
belonging
to
john
bellingham
and
their
discovery
resulted
from
certain
operations
the
clearing
of
the
carried
out
on
behalf
of
the
absent
landlord
but
by
whose
orders
were
those
works
undertaken
clearly
by
the
orders
of
the
landlord
agent
but
the
landlord
agent
was
known
to
be
jellicoe
therefore
these
remains
were
brought
to
light
at
this
peculiarly
opportune
moment
by
the
action
of
jellicoe
the
coincidence
i
say
again
was
very
remarkable
but
what
instantly
arrested
my
attention
on
reading
the
newspaper
report
was
the
unusual
manner
in
which
the
arm
had
been
separated
for
besides
the
bones
of
the
arm
proper
there
were
those
of
what
anatomists
call
the
the
and
this
was
very
remarkable
it
seemed
to
suggest
a
knowledge
of
anatomy
and
yet
no
murderer
even
if
he
possessed
such
knowledge
would
make
a
display
of
it
on
such
an
occasion
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
must
be
some
other
explanation
accordingly
when
other
remains
had
come
to
light
and
all
had
been
collected
at
woodford
i
asked
my
friend
berkeley
to
go
down
there
and
inspect
them
he
did
so
and
this
is
what
he
found
both
arms
had
been
detached
in
the
same
peculiar
manner
both
were
complete
and
all
the
bones
were
from
the
same
body
the
bones
were
quite
clean
of
soft
structures
i
mean
there
were
no
cuts
scratches
or
marks
on
them
there
was
not
a
trace
of
adipocere
the
peculiar
waxy
soap
that
forms
in
bodies
that
decay
in
water
or
in
a
damp
situation
the
right
hand
had
been
detached
at
the
time
the
arm
was
thrown
into
the
pond
and
the
left
ring
finger
had
been
separated
and
had
vanished
this
latter
fact
had
attracted
my
attention
from
the
first
but
i
will
leave
its
consideration
for
the
moment
and
return
to
it
later
how
did
you
discover
that
the
hand
had
been
detached
jellicoe
asked
by
the
submersion
marks
replied
thorndyke
it
was
lying
on
the
bottom
of
the
pond
in
a
position
which
would
have
been
impossible
if
it
had
been
attached
to
the
arm
you
interest
me
exceedingly
said
jellicoe
it
appears
that
a
expert
finds
in
the
running
brooks
sermons
in
bones
and
evidence
in
everything
but
do
let
me
interrupt
you
doctor
berkeley
observations
thorndyke
resumed
together
with
the
medical
evidence
at
the
inquest
led
me
to
certain
conclusions
let
me
state
the
facts
which
were
disclosed
the
remains
which
had
been
assembled
formed
a
complete
human
skeleton
with
the
exception
of
the
skull
one
finger
and
the
legs
from
the
knee
to
the
ankle
including
both
this
was
a
very
impressive
fact
for
the
bones
that
were
missing
included
all
those
which
could
have
been
identified
as
belonging
or
not
belonging
to
john
bellingham
and
the
bones
that
were
present
were
the
unidentifiable
remainder
it
had
a
suspicious
appearance
of
selection
but
the
parts
that
were
present
were
also
curiously
suggestive
in
all
cases
the
mode
of
dismemberment
was
peculiar
for
an
ordinary
person
would
have
divided
the
leaving
the
attached
to
the
thigh
whereas
it
had
evidently
been
left
attached
to
the
shinbone
and
the
head
would
most
probably
have
been
removed
by
cutting
through
the
neck
instead
of
being
neatly
detached
from
the
spine
and
all
these
bones
were
almost
entirely
free
from
marks
or
scratches
such
as
would
naturally
occur
in
an
ordinary
dismemberment
and
all
were
quite
free
from
adipocere
and
now
as
to
the
conclusions
which
i
drew
from
these
facts
first
there
was
the
peculiar
grouping
of
the
bones
what
was
the
meaning
of
that
well
the
idea
of
a
punctilious
anatomist
was
obviously
absurd
and
i
put
it
aside
but
was
there
any
other
explanation
yes
there
was
the
bones
had
appeared
in
the
natural
groups
that
are
held
together
by
ligaments
and
they
had
separated
at
points
where
they
were
attached
principally
by
muscles
the
for
instance
which
really
belongs
to
the
thigh
is
attached
to
it
by
muscle
but
to
the
by
a
stout
ligament
and
so
with
the
bones
of
the
arm
they
are
connected
to
one
another
by
ligaments
but
to
the
trunk
only
by
muscle
excepting
at
one
end
of
the
but
this
was
a
very
significant
fact
ligament
decays
much
more
slowly
than
muscle
so
that
in
a
body
of
which
the
muscles
had
largely
decayed
the
bones
might
still
be
held
together
by
ligament
the
peculiar
grouping
therefore
suggested
that
the
body
had
been
partly
reduced
to
a
skeleton
before
it
was
dismembered
that
it
had
then
been
merely
pulled
apart
and
not
divided
with
a
knife
this
suggestion
was
remarkably
confirmed
by
the
total
absence
of
or
scratches
then
there
was
the
fact
that
all
the
bones
were
quite
free
from
adipocere
now
if
an
arm
or
a
thigh
should
be
deposited
in
water
and
left
undisturbed
to
decay
it
is
certain
that
large
masses
of
adipocere
would
be
formed
probably
more
than
half
of
the
flesh
would
be
converted
into
this
substance
the
absence
of
adipocere
therefore
proved
that
the
bulk
of
the
flesh
had
disappeared
or
been
removed
from
the
bones
before
they
were
deposited
in
the
pond
that
in
fact
it
was
not
a
body
but
a
skeleton
that
had
been
deposited
but
what
kind
of
skeleton
if
it
was
the
recent
skeleton
of
a
murdered
man
then
the
bones
had
been
carefully
stripped
of
flesh
so
as
to
leave
the
ligaments
intact
but
this
was
highly
improbable
for
there
could
be
no
object
in
preserving
the
ligaments
and
the
absence
of
scratches
was
against
this
view
then
they
did
not
appear
to
be
graveyard
bones
the
collection
was
too
complete
it
is
very
rare
to
find
a
graveyard
skeleton
of
which
many
of
the
small
bones
are
not
missing
and
such
bones
are
usually
more
or
less
weathered
and
friable
they
did
not
appear
to
be
bones
such
as
may
be
bought
at
an
osteological
dealer
for
these
usually
have
perforations
to
admit
the
macerating
fluid
to
the
marrow
cavities
dealers
bones
too
are
very
seldom
all
from
the
same
body
and
the
small
bones
of
the
hand
are
drilled
with
holes
to
enable
them
to
be
strung
on
catgut
they
were
not
bones
as
there
was
no
trace
of
red
lead
in
the
openings
for
the
nutrient
arteries
what
the
appearances
did
suggest
was
that
these
were
parts
of
a
body
which
had
decayed
in
a
very
dry
atmosphere
in
which
no
adipocere
would
be
formed
and
which
had
been
pulled
or
broken
apart
also
that
the
ligaments
which
held
the
body
or
rather
skeleton
together
were
brittle
and
friable
as
suggested
by
the
detached
hand
which
had
probably
broken
off
accidentally
but
the
only
kind
of
body
that
completely
answered
this
description
is
an
egyptian
mummy
a
mummy
it
is
true
has
been
more
or
less
preserved
but
on
exposure
to
the
air
of
such
a
climate
as
ours
it
perishes
rapidly
the
ligaments
being
the
last
of
the
soft
parts
to
disappear
the
hypothesis
that
these
bones
were
parts
of
a
mummy
naturally
suggested
jellicoe
if
he
had
murdered
john
bellingham
and
concealed
his
body
in
the
he
would
have
a
spare
mummy
on
his
hands
and
that
mummy
would
have
been
exposed
to
the
air
and
to
somewhat
rough
handling
a
very
interesting
circumstance
connected
with
these
remains
was
that
the
ring
finger
was
missing
now
fingers
have
on
sundry
occasions
been
detached
from
dead
hands
for
the
sake
of
the
rings
on
them
but
in
such
cases
the
object
has
been
to
secure
a
valuable
ring
uninjured
if
this
hand
was
the
hand
of
john
bellingham
there
was
no
such
object
the
purpose
was
to
prevent
identification
and
that
purpose
would
have
been
more
easily
and
much
more
completely
achieved
by
sacrificing
the
ring
by
filing
through
it
or
breaking
it
off
the
finger
the
appearances
therefore
did
not
quite
agree
with
the
apparent
purpose
then
could
there
be
any
other
purpose
with
which
they
agreed
better
yes
there
could
if
it
had
happened
that
john
bellingham
were
known
to
have
worn
a
ring
on
that
finger
and
especially
if
that
ring
fitted
tightly
the
removal
of
the
finger
would
serve
a
very
useful
purpose
it
would
create
an
impression
that
the
finger
had
been
removed
on
account
of
a
ring
to
prevent
identification
which
impression
would
in
turn
produce
a
suspicion
that
the
hand
was
that
of
john
bellingham
and
yet
it
would
not
be
evidence
that
could
be
used
to
establish
identity
now
if
jellicoe
were
the
murderer
and
had
the
body
hidden
elsewhere
vague
suspicion
would
be
precisely
what
he
would
desire
and
positive
evidence
what
he
would
wish
to
avoid
it
transpired
later
that
john
bellingham
did
wear
a
ring
on
that
finger
and
that
the
ring
fitted
very
tightly
whence
it
followed
that
the
absence
of
the
finger
was
an
additional
point
tending
to
implicate
jellicoe
and
now
let
us
briefly
review
this
mass
of
evidence
you
will
see
that
it
consists
of
a
multitude
of
items
each
either
trivial
or
speculative
up
to
the
time
of
the
actual
discovery
i
had
not
a
single
crucial
fact
nor
any
clue
as
to
motive
but
slight
as
the
individual
points
of
evidence
were
they
pointed
with
impressive
unanimity
to
one
person
jellicoe
thus
the
person
who
had
the
opportunity
to
commit
murder
and
dispose
of
the
body
was
jellicoe
the
deceased
was
last
certainly
seen
alive
with
jellicoe
an
unidentified
human
body
was
delivered
to
the
museum
by
jellicoe
the
only
person
who
could
have
a
motive
for
personating
the
deceased
was
jellicoe
the
only
known
person
who
could
possibly
have
done
so
was
jellicoe
one
of
the
two
persons
who
could
have
had
a
motive
for
dropping
the
scarab
was
jellicoe
the
person
who
found
that
scarab
was
jellicoe
although
owing
to
his
defective
eyesight
and
his
spectacles
he
was
the
most
unlikely
person
of
those
present
to
find
it
the
person
who
was
responsible
for
the
execution
of
the
defective
will
was
jellicoe
then
as
to
the
remains
they
were
apparently
not
those
of
john
bellingham
but
parts
of
a
particular
kind
of
body
but
the
only
person
who
was
known
to
have
had
such
a
body
in
his
possession
was
jellicoe
the
only
person
who
could
have
had
any
motive
for
substituting
those
remains
for
the
remains
of
the
deceased
was
jellicoe
finally
the
person
who
caused
the
discovery
of
those
remains
at
that
singularly
opportune
moment
was
jellicoe
this
was
the
sum
of
the
evidence
that
was
in
my
possession
up
to
the
time
of
the
hearing
and
indeed
for
some
time
after
and
it
was
not
enough
to
act
upon
but
when
the
case
had
been
heard
in
court
it
was
evident
either
that
the
proceedings
would
be
abandoned
which
was
unlikely
or
that
there
would
be
new
developments
i
watched
the
progress
of
events
with
profound
interest
an
attempt
had
been
made
by
jellicoe
or
some
other
person
to
get
the
will
administered
without
producing
the
body
of
john
bellingham
and
that
attempt
had
failed
the
coroner
jury
had
refused
to
identify
the
remains
the
probate
court
had
refused
to
presume
the
death
of
the
testator
as
affairs
stood
the
will
could
not
be
administered
what
would
be
the
next
move
it
was
virtually
certain
that
it
would
consist
in
the
production
of
something
which
would
identify
the
unrecognized
remains
as
those
of
the
testator
but
what
would
that
something
be
the
answer
to
that
question
would
contain
the
answer
to
another
question
my
solution
of
the
mystery
the
true
solution
if
i
was
wrong
it
was
possible
that
some
of
the
undoubtedly
genuine
bones
of
john
bellingham
might
presently
be
discovered
for
instance
the
skull
the
or
the
left
fibula
by
any
of
which
the
remains
could
be
positively
identified
if
i
was
right
only
one
thing
could
possibly
happen
jellicoe
would
have
to
play
the
trump
card
that
he
had
been
holding
back
in
case
the
court
should
refuse
the
application
a
card
that
he
was
evidently
reluctant
to
play
he
would
have
to
produce
the
bones
of
the
mummy
finger
together
with
john
bellingham
ring
no
other
course
was
possible
but
not
only
would
the
bones
and
the
ring
have
to
be
found
together
they
would
have
to
be
found
in
a
place
which
was
accessible
to
jellicoe
and
so
far
under
his
control
that
he
could
determine
the
exact
time
when
the
discovery
should
be
made
i
waited
patiently
for
the
answer
to
my
question
was
i
right
or
was
i
wrong
and
in
due
course
the
answer
came
the
bones
and
the
ring
were
discovered
in
the
well
in
the
grounds
of
godfrey
bellingham
late
house
that
house
was
the
property
of
john
bellingham
jellicoe
was
john
bellingham
agent
hence
it
was
practically
certain
that
the
date
on
which
the
well
was
emptied
was
settled
by
jellicoe
the
oracle
had
spoken
the
discovery
proved
conclusively
that
the
bones
were
not
those
of
john
bellingham
for
if
they
had
been
the
ring
would
have
been
unnecessary
for
identification
but
if
the
bones
were
not
john
bellingham
the
ring
was
from
which
followed
the
important
corollary
that
whoever
had
deposited
those
bones
in
the
well
had
had
possession
of
the
body
of
john
bellingham
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
that
person
was
jellicoe
on
receiving
this
final
confirmation
of
my
conclusions
i
applied
forthwith
to
doctor
norbury
for
permission
to
examine
the
mummy
of
with
the
result
that
you
are
already
acquainted
with
as
thorndyke
concluded
jellicoe
regarded
him
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
and
then
said
you
have
given
us
a
most
complete
and
lucid
exposition
of
your
method
of
investigation
sir
i
have
enjoyed
it
exceedingly

badger
assented
emphatically
well
i
need

you

the

my

but
i
desire
to
make
it
and
you
no

will
be
interested
to
hear

he
opened
the
silver
case
and
selected
a
fresh
cigarette
which
however
he
did
not
light
inspector
badger
produced
a
funereal
notebook
which
he
laid
open
on
his
knee
and
the
rest
of

settled
ourselves
in
our
chairs
with
no
little
curiosity
to
hear
statement
chapter
xx
the
end
of
the
case
a
profound
silence
had
fallen
on
the
room
and
its
occupants
jellicoe
sat
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
table
as
if
deep
in
thought
the
unlighted
cigarette
in
one
hand
the
other
grasping
the
tumbler
of
water
presently
inspector
badger
coughed
impatiently
and
he
looked
up
i
beg
your
pardon
gentleman
he
said
i
am
keeping
you
waiting
he
took
a
sip
from
the
tumbler
opened
a
and
took
out
a
match
but
apparently
altering
his
mind
laid
it
down
and
commenced
the
unfortunate
affair
which
has
brought
you
here
had
its
origin
ten
years
ago
at
that
time
my
friend
hurst
became
suddenly
involved
in
financial
difficulties
am
i
speaking
too
fast
for
you
mr
badger
no
not
at
all
replied
badger
i
am
taking
it
down
in
shorthand
thank
you
said
jellicoe
he
became
involved
in
serious
difficulties
and
came
to
me
for
assistance
he
wished
to
borrow
five
thousand
pounds
to
enable
him
to
meet
his
engagements
i
had
a
certain
amount
of
money
at
my
disposal
but
i
did
not
consider
hurst
security
satisfactory
accordingly
i
felt
compelled
to
refuse
but
on
the
very
next
day
john
bellingham
called
on
me
with
a
draft
of
his
will
which
he
wished
me
to
look
over
before
it
was
executed
it
was
an
absurd
will
and
i
nearly
told
him
so
but
then
an
idea
occurred
to
me
in
connection
with
hurst
it
was
obvious
to
me
as
soon
as
i
glanced
through
the
will
that
if
the
burial
clause
was
left
as
the
testator
had
drafted
it
hurst
had
a
very
good
chance
of
inheriting
the
property
and
as
i
was
named
as
the
executor
i
should
be
able
to
give
full
effect
to
that
clause
accordingly
i
asked
for
a
few
days
to
consider
the
will
and
then
i
called
upon
hurst
and
made
a
proposal
to
him
which
was
this
that
i
should
advance
him
five
thousand
pounds
without
security
that
i
should
ask
for
no
repayment
but
that
he
should
assign
to
me
any
interest
that
he
might
have
or
acquire
in
the
estate
of
john
bellingham
up
to
ten
thousand
pounds
or
of
any
sum
that
he
might
inherit
if
over
that
amount
he
asked
if
john
had
yet
made
any
will
and
i
replied
quite
correctly
that
he
had
not
he
inquired
if
i
knew
what
testamentary
arrangements
john
intended
to
make
and
again
i
answered
quite
correctly
that
i
believed
john
proposed
to
devise
the
bulk
of
his
property
to
his
brother
godfrey
thereupon
hurst
accepted
my
proposal
i
made
him
the
advance
and
he
executed
the
assignment
after
a
few
days
delay
i
passed
the
will
as
satisfactory
the
actual
document
was
written
from
the
draft
by
the
testator
himself
and
a
fortnight
after
hurst
had
executed
the
assignment
john
signed
the
will
in
my
office
by
the
provisions
of
that
will
i
stood
an
excellent
chance
of
becoming
virtually
the
principal
beneficiary
unless
godfrey
should
contest
hurst
claim
and
the
court
should
override
the
conditions
of
clause
two
you
will
now
understand
the
motives
which
governed
my
subsequent
actions
you
will
also
see
doctor
thorndyke
how
very
near
to
the
truth
your
reasoning
carried
you
and
you
will
understand
as
i
wish
you
to
do
that
hurst
was
no
party
to
any
of
these
proceedings
which
i
am
about
to
describe
coming
now
to
the
interview
in
queen
square
in
october
nineteen
hundred
and
two
you
are
aware
of
the
general
circumstances
from
my
evidence
in
court
which
was
literally
correct
up
to
a
certain
point
the
interview
took
place
in
a
room
on
the
third
floor
in
which
were
stored
the
cases
which
john
had
brought
with
him
from
egypt
the
mummy
was
unpacked
as
were
some
other
objects
that
he
was
not
offering
to
the
museum
but
several
cases
were
still
unopened
at
the
conclusion
of
the
interview
i
accompanied
doctor
norbury
down
to
the
street
door
and
we
stood
on
the
doorstep
conversing
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
then
doctor
norbury
went
away
and
i
returned
upstairs
now
the
house
in
queen
square
is
virtually
a
museum
the
upper
part
is
separated
from
the
lower
by
a
massive
door
which
opens
from
the
hall
and
gives
access
to
the
staircase
and
which
is
fitted
with
a
chubb
there
are
two
of
which
john
used
to
keep
one
and
i
the
other
you
will
find
them
both
in
the
safe
behind
me
the
caretaker
had
no
key
and
no
access
to
the
upper
part
of
the
house
unless
admitted
by
one
of
us
at
the
time
when
i
came
in
after
doctor
norbury
had
left
the
caretaker
was
in
the
cellar
where
i
could
hear
him
breaking
coke
for
the
furnace
i
had
left
john
on
the
third
floor
opening
some
of
the
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
with
a
tool
somewhat
like
a
plasterer
hammer
that
is
a
hammer
with
a
small
at
the
reverse
of
the
head
as
i
stood
talking
to
doctor
norbury
i
could
hear
him
knocking
out
the
nails
and
wrenching
up
the
lids
and
when
i
entered
the
doorway
leading
to
the
stairs
i
could
still
hear
him
just
as
i
closed
the
staircase
door
behind
me
i
heard
a
rumbling
noise
from
above
then
all
was
still
i
went
up
the
stairs
to
the
second
floor
where
as
the
staircase
was
all
in
darkness
i
stopped
to
light
the
gas
as
i
turned
to
ascend
the
next
flight
i
saw
a
hand
projecting
over
the
edge
of
the
landing
i
ran
up
the
stairs
and
there
on
the
landing
i
saw
john
lying
huddled
up
in
a
heap
at
the
foot
of
the
top
flight
there
was
a
wound
at
the
side
of
his
forehead
from
which
a
little
blood
was
trickling
the
lay
on
the
floor
close
by
him
and
there
was
blood
on
the
when
i
looked
up
the
stairs
i
saw
a
rag
of
torn
matting
over
the
top
stair
it
was
quite
easy
to
see
what
had
happened
he
had
walked
quickly
out
on
the
landing
with
the
in
his
hand
his
foot
had
caught
in
the
torn
matting
and
he
had
pitched
head
foremost
down
the
stairs
still
holding
the
he
had
fallen
so
that
his
head
had
come
down
on
the
upturned
edge
of
the
he
had
then
rolled
over
and
the
had
dropped
from
his
hand
i
lit
a
wax
match
and
stooped
down
to
look
at
him
his
head
was
in
a
very
peculiar
position
which
made
me
suspect
that
his
neck
was
broken
there
was
extremely
little
bleeding
from
the
wound
he
was
perfectly
motionless
i
could
detect
no
sign
of
breathing
and
i
felt
no
doubt
that
he
was
dead
it
was
an
exceedingly
regrettable
affair
and
it
placed
me
as
i
perceived
at
once
in
an
extremely
awkward
position
my
first
impulse
was
to
send
the
caretaker
for
a
doctor
and
a
policeman
but
a
reflection
convinced
me
that
there
were
serious
objections
to
this
course
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
i
had
not
myself
knocked
him
down
with
the
of
course
there
was
nothing
to
show
that
i
had
but
we
were
alone
in
the
house
with
the
exception
of
the
caretaker
who
was
down
in
the
basement
out
of
earshot
there
would
be
an
inquest
at
the
inquest
inquiries
would
be
made
as
to
the
will
which
was
known
to
exist
but
as
soon
as
the
will
was
produced
hurst
would
become
suspicious
he
would
probably
make
a
statement
to
the
coroner
and
i
should
be
charged
with
the
murder
or
even
if
i
were
not
charged
hurst
would
suspect
me
and
would
probably
repudiate
the
assignment
and
under
the
circumstances
it
would
be
practically
impossible
for
me
to
enforce
it
he
would
refuse
to
pay
and
i
could
not
take
my
claim
into
court
i
sat
down
on
the
stairs
just
above
poor
john
body
and
considered
the
matter
in
detail
at
the
worst
i
stood
a
fair
chance
of
hanging
at
the
best
i
stood
to
lose
close
upon
fifty
thousand
pounds
these
were
not
pleasant
alternatives
supposing
on
the
other
hand
i
concealed
the
body
and
gave
out
that
john
had
gone
to
paris
there
was
of
course
the
risk
of
discovery
in
which
case
i
should
certainly
be
convicted
of
the
murder
but
if
no
discovery
occurred
i
was
not
only
safe
from
suspicion
but
i
secured
the
fifty
thousand
pounds
in
either
case
there
was
considerable
risk
but
in
one
there
was
the
certainty
of
loss
whereas
in
the
other
there
was
a
material
advantage
to
justify
the
risk
the
question
was
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
conceal
the
body
if
it
were
then
the
contingent
profit
was
worth
the
slight
additional
risk
but
a
human
body
is
a
very
difficult
thing
to
dispose
of
especially
by
a
person
of
so
little
scientific
culture
as
myself
it
is
curious
that
i
considered
this
question
for
a
quite
considerable
time
before
the
obvious
solution
presented
itself
i
turned
over
at
least
a
dozen
methods
of
disposing
of
the
body
and
rejected
them
all
as
impracticable
then
suddenly
i
remembered
the
mummy
upstairs
at
first
it
only
occurred
to
me
as
a
fantastic
possibility
that
i
could
conceal
the
body
in
the
but
as
i
turned
over
the
idea
i
began
to
see
that
it
was
really
practicable
and
not
only
practicable
but
easy
and
not
only
easy
but
eminently
safe
if
once
the
was
in
the
museum
i
was
rid
of
it
for
ever
the
circumstances
were
as
you
sir
have
justly
observed
singularly
favorable
there
would
be
no
hue
and
cry
no
hurry
no
anxiety
but
ample
time
for
all
the
necessary
preparations
then
the
itself
was
curiously
suitable
its
length
was
ample
as
i
knew
from
having
measured
it
it
was
a
cartonnage
of
rather
flexible
material
and
had
an
opening
behind
secured
with
a
lacing
so
that
it
could
be
opened
without
injury
nothing
need
be
cut
but
the
lacing
which
could
be
replaced
a
little
damage
might
be
done
in
extracting
the
mummy
and
in
introducing
the
deceased
but
such
cracks
as
might
occur
would
be
of
no
importance
for
here
again
fortune
favored
me
the
whole
of
the
back
of
the
was
coated
with
bitumen
and
it
would
be
easy
when
once
the
deceased
was
safely
inside
to
apply
a
fresh
coat
which
would
cover
up
not
only
the
cracks
but
also
the
new
lacing
after
careful
consideration
i
decided
to
adopt
the
plan
i
went
downstairs
and
sent
the
caretaker
on
an
errand
to
the
law
courts
then
i
returned
and
carried
the
deceased
up
to
one
of
the
rooms
where
i
removed
his
clothes
and
laid
him
out
on
a
long
in
the
position
in
which
he
would
lie
in
the
i
folded
his
clothes
neatly
and
packed
them
with
the
exception
of
his
boots
in
a
that
he
had
been
taking
to
paris
and
which
contained
nothing
but
his
nightclothes
toilet
articles
and
a
change
of
linen
by
the
time
i
had
done
this
and
thoroughly
washed
the
oilcloth
on
the
stairs
and
landing
the
caretaker
had
returned
i
informed
him
that
bellingham
had
started
for
paris
and
then
i
went
home
the
upper
part
of
the
house
was
of
course
secured
by
the
chubb
lock
but
i
had
also
abundantiâ
locked
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
i
had
deposited
the
deceased
i
had
of
course
some
knowledge
of
the
methods
of
embalming
but
principally
of
those
employed
by
the
ancients
hence
on
the
following
day
i
went
to
the
british
museum
library
and
consulted
the
most
recent
works
on
the
subject
and
exceedingly
interesting
they
were
as
showing
the
remarkable
improvements
that
modern
knowledge
has
effected
in
this
ancient
art
i
need
not
trouble
you
with
details
that
are
familiar
to
you
the
process
that
i
selected
as
the
simplest
for
a
beginner
was
that
of
formalin
injection
and
i
went
straight
from
the
museum
to
purchase
the
necessary
materials
i
did
not
however
buy
an
embalming
syringe
the
book
stated
that
an
ordinary
anatomical
injecting
syringe
would
answer
the
same
purpose
and
i
thought
it
a
more
discreet
purchase
i
fear
that
i
bungled
the
injection
terribly
although
i
had
carefully
studied
the
plates
in
a
treatise
on
anatomy
gray
i
think
however
if
my
methods
were
clumsy
they
were
quite
effectual
i
carried
out
the
process
on
the
evening
of
the
third
day
and
when
i
locked
up
the
house
that
night
i
had
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
poor
remains
were
secure
from
corruption
and
decay
but
this
was
not
enough
the
great
weight
of
a
fresh
body
as
compared
with
that
of
a
mummy
would
be
immediately
noticed
by
those
who
had
the
handling
of
the
moreover
the
damp
from
the
body
would
quickly
ruin
the
cartonnage
and
would
cause
a
steamy
film
on
the
inside
of
the
glass
case
in
which
it
would
be
exhibited
and
this
would
probably
lead
to
an
examination
clearly
then
it
was
necessary
that
the
remains
of
the
deceased
should
be
thoroughly
dried
before
they
were
enclosed
in
the
cartonnage
here
my
unfortunate
deficiency
in
scientific
knowledge
was
a
great
drawback
i
had
no
idea
how
this
result
would
be
achieved
and
in
the
end
was
compelled
to
consult
a
taxidermist
to
whom
i
represented
that
i
wished
to
collect
some
small
animals
and
reptiles
and
rapidly
dry
them
for
convenience
of
transport
by
this
person
i
was
advised
to
immerse
the
dead
animals
in
a
jar
of
methylated
spirit
for
a
week
and
then
expose
them
in
a
current
of
warm
dry
air
but
the
plan
of
immersing
the
remains
of
the
deceased
in
a
jar
of
methylated
spirit
was
obviously
impracticable
however
i
bethought
me
that
we
had
in
our
collection
a
porphyry
sarcophagus
the
cavity
of
which
had
been
shaped
to
receive
a
small
mummy
in
its
case
i
tried
the
deceased
in
the
sarcophagus
and
found
that
he
just
fitted
the
cavity
loosely
i
obtained
a
few
gallons
of
methylated
spirit
which
i
poured
into
the
cavity
just
covering
the
body
and
then
i
put
on
the
lid
and
luted
it
down
with
putty
i
trust
i
do
not
weary
you
with
these
particulars
i
ask
you
to
cut
it
as
short
as
you
can
jellicoe
said
badger
it
has
been
a
long
yarn
and
time
is
running
on
for
my
part
said
thorndyke
i
find
these
details
deeply
interesting
and
instructive
they
fill
in
the
outline
that
i
had
drawn
by
inference
precisely
said
jellicoe
then
i
will
proceed
i
left
the
deceased
soaking
in
the
spirit
for
a
fortnight
and
then
took
him
out
wiped
him
dry
and
laid
him
on
four
chairs
just
over
the
pipes
and
i
let
a
free
current
of
air
pass
through
the
room
the
result
interested
me
exceedingly
by
the
end
of
the
third
day
the
hands
and
feet
had
become
quite
dry
and
shriveled
and
horny
so
that
the
ring
actually
dropped
off
the
shrunken
finger
the
nose
looked
like
a
fold
of
parchment
and
the
skin
of
the
body
was
so
dry
and
smooth
that
you
could
have
engrossed
a
lease
on
it
for
the
first
day
or
two
i
turned
the
deceased
at
intervals
so
that
he
should
dry
evenly
and
then
i
proceeded
to
get
the
case
ready
i
divided
the
lacing
and
extracted
the
mummy
with
great
care
with
great
care
as
to
the
case
i
mean
for
the
mummy
suffered
some
injury
in
the
extraction
it
was
very
badly
embalmed
and
so
brittle
that
it
broke
in
several
places
while
i
was
getting
it
out
and
when
i
unrolled
it
the
head
separated
and
both
the
arms
came
off
on
the
sixth
day
after
the
removal
from
the
sarcophagus
i
took
the
bandages
that
i
had
removed
from
and
very
carefully
wrapped
the
deceased
in
them
sprinkling
powdered
myrrh
and
gum
benzoin
freely
on
the
body
and
between
the
folds
of
the
wrappings
to
disguise
the
faint
odor
of
the
spirit
and
the
formalin
that
still
lingered
about
the
body
when
the
wrappings
had
been
applied
the
deceased
really
had
a
most
workmanlike
appearance
he
would
have
looked
quite
well
in
a
glass
case
even
without
the
cartonnage
and
i
felt
almost
regretful
at
having
to
put
him
out
of
sight
for
ever
it
was
a
difficult
business
getting
him
into
the
case
without
assistance
and
i
cracked
the
cartonnage
badly
in
several
places
before
he
was
safely
enclosed
but
i
got
him
in
at
last
and
then
when
i
had
closed
up
the
case
with
a
new
lacing
i
applied
a
fresh
layer
of
bitumen
which
effectually
covered
up
the
cracks
and
the
new
cord
a
dusty
cloth
dabbed
over
the
bitumen
when
it
was
dry
disguised
its
newness
and
the
cartonnage
with
its
tenant
was
ready
for
delivery
i
notified
doctor
norbury
of
the
fact
and
five
days
later
he
came
and
removed
it
to
the
museum
now
that
the
main
difficulty
was
disposed
of
i
began
to
consider
the
further
difficulty
to
which
you
sir
have
alluded
with
such
admirable
perspicuity
it
was
necessary
that
john
bellingham
should
make
one
more
appearance
in
public
before
sinking
into
final
oblivion
accordingly
i
devised
the
visit
to
hurst
house
which
was
calculated
to
serve
two
purposes
it
created
a
satisfactory
date
for
the
disappearance
eliminating
me
from
any
connection
with
it
and
by
throwing
some
suspicion
on
hurst
it
would
make
him
more
amenable
less
likely
to
dispute
my
claim
when
he
learned
the
provisions
of
the
will
the
affair
was
quite
simple
i
knew
that
hurst
had
changed
his
servants
since
i
was
last
at
his
house
and
i
knew
his
habits
on
that
day
i
took
the
suitcase
to
charing
cross
and
deposited
it
in
the
cloakroom
called
at
hurst
office
to
make
sure
that
he
was
there
and
went
from
thence
direct
to
cannon
street
and
caught
the
train
to
eltham
on
arriving
at
the
house
i
took
the
precaution
to
remove
my
spectacles
the
only
distinctive
feature
of
my
exterior
and
was
duly
shown
into
the
study
at
my
request
as
soon
as
the
housemaid
had
left
the
room
i
quietly
let
myself
out
by
the
french
window
which
i
closed
behind
me
but
could
not
fasten
went
out
at
the
side
gate
and
closed
that
also
behind
me
holding
the
bolt
of
the
latch
back
with
my
so
that
i
need
not
slam
the
gate
to
shut
it
the
other
events
of
that
day
including
the
dropping
of
the
scarab
i
need
not
describe
as
they
are
known
to
you
but
i
may
fitly
make
a
few
remarks
on
the
unfortunate
tactical
error
into
which
i
fell
in
respect
of
the
bones
that
error
arose
as
you
have
doubtless
perceived
from
the
lawyer
incurable
habit
of
underestimating
the
scientific
expert
i
had
no
idea
mere
bones
were
capable
of
furnishing
so
much
information
to
a
man
of
science
the
way
in
which
the
affair
came
about
was
this
the
damaged
mummy
of
perishing
gradually
by
exposure
to
the
air
was
not
only
an
eyesore
to
me
it
was
a
definite
danger
it
was
the
only
remaining
link
between
me
and
the
disappearance
i
resolved
to
be
rid
of
it
and
cast
about
for
some
means
of
destroying
it
and
then
in
an
evil
moment
the
idea
of
utilizing
it
occurred
to
me
there
was
an
undoubted
danger
that
the
court
might
refuse
to
presume
death
after
so
short
an
interval
and
if
the
permission
should
be
postponed
the
will
might
never
be
administered
during
my
lifetime
hence
if
these
bones
of
could
be
made
to
simulate
the
remains
of
the
deceased
testator
a
definite
good
would
be
achieved
but
i
knew
that
the
entire
skeleton
could
never
be
mistaken
for
his
the
deceased
had
broken
his
and
damaged
his
ankle
injuries
which
i
assumed
would
leave
some
permanent
trace
but
if
a
judicious
selection
of
the
bones
were
deposited
in
a
suitable
place
together
with
some
object
clearly
identifiable
as
appertaining
to
the
deceased
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
difficulty
would
be
met
i
need
not
trouble
you
with
details
the
course
which
i
adopted
is
known
to
you
with
the
attendant
circumstances
even
the
accidental
detachment
of
the
right
hand
which
broke
off
as
i
was
packing
the
arm
in
my
handbag
erroneous
as
that
course
was
it
would
have
been
successful
but
for
the
unforeseen
contingency
of
your
being
retained
in
the
case
thus
for
nearly
two
years
i
remained
in
complete
security
from
time
to
time
i
dropped
in
at
the
museum
to
see
if
the
deceased
was
keeping
in
good
condition
and
on
those
occasions
i
used
to
reflect
with
satisfaction
on
the
gratifying
circumstance
accidental
though
it
was
that
his
wishes
as
expressed
very
imperfectly
in
clause
two
had
been
fully
complied
with
and
that
without
prejudice
to
my
interests
the
awakening
came
on
that
evening
when
i
saw
you
at
the
temple
gate
talking
with
doctor
berkeley
i
suspected
immediately
that
something
was
gone
amiss
and
that
it
was
too
late
to
take
any
useful
action
since
then
i
have
waited
here
in
hourly
expectation
of
this
visit
and
now
the
time
has
come
you
have
made
the
winning
move
and
it
remains
only
for
me
to
pay
my
debts
like
an
honest
gambler
he
paused
and
quietly
lit
his
cigarette
inspector
badger
yawned
and
put
away
his
notebook
have
you
done
mr
jellicoe
the
inspector
asked
i
want
to
carry
out
my
contract
to
the
letter
you
know
though
it
getting
devilish
late
jellicoe
took
his
cigarette
from
his
mouth
and
drank
a
glass
of
water
i
forgot
to
ask
he
said
whether
you
unrolled
the
mummy
if
i
may
apply
the
term
to
the
imperfectly
treated
remains
of
my
deceased
client
i
did
not
open
the
replied
thorndyke
you
did
not
exclaimed
jellicoe
then
how
did
you
verify
your
suspicions
i
took
an
photograph
ah
indeed
jellicoe
pondered
for
some
moments
astonishing
he
murmured
and
most
ingenious
the
resources
of
science
at
the
present
day
are
truly
wonderful
is
there
anything
more
that
you
want
to
say
asked
badger
because
if
you
do
time
up
anything
more
jellicoe
repeated
slowly
anything
more
no
i
think
think
the
time
is
up
yes
the
the
time
he
broke
off
and
sat
with
a
strange
look
fixed
on
thorndyke
his
face
had
suddenly
undergone
a
curious
change
it
looked
shrunken
and
cadaverous
and
his
lips
had
assumed
a
peculiar
color
is
anything
the
matter
mr
jellicoe
badger
asked
uneasily
are
you
not
feeling
well
sir
jellicoe
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
the
question
for
he
returned
no
answer
but
sat
motionless
leaning
back
in
his
chair
with
his
hands
spread
out
on
the
table
and
his
strangely
intent
gaze
bent
on
thorndyke
suddenly
his
head
dropped
on
his
breast
and
his
body
seemed
to
collapse
and
as
with
one
accord
we
sprang
to
our
feet
he
slid
forward
off
his
chair
and
disappeared
under
the
table
good
lord
the
man
fainted
exclaimed
badger
in
a
moment
he
was
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
trembling
with
excitement
groping
under
the
table
he
dragged
the
unconscious
lawyer
out
into
the
light
and
knelt
over
him
staring
into
his
face
what
the
matter
with
him
doctor
he
asked
looking
up
at
thorndyke
is
it
apoplexy
or
is
it
a
heart
attack
think
you
thorndyke
shook
his
head
though
he
stooped
and
put
his
fingers
on
the
unconscious
man
wrist
prussic
acid
or
potassium
cyanide
is
what
the
appearances
suggest
he
replied
but
ca
you
do
anything
demanded
the
inspector
thorndyke
dropped
the
arm
which
fell
limply
to
the
floor
you
ca
do
much
for
a
dead
man
he
said
dead
then
he
has
slipped
through
our
fingers
after
all
he
has
anticipated
the
sentence
that
is
all
thorndyke
spoke
in
an
even
impassive
tone
which
struck
me
as
rather
strange
considering
the
suddenness
of
the
tragedy
as
did
also
the
complete
absence
of
surprize
in
his
manner
he
seemed
to
treat
the
occurrence
as
a
perfectly
natural
one
not
so
inspector
badger
who
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
with
his
hands
thrust
into
his
pockets
scowling
sullenly
down
at
the
dead
lawyer
i
was
an
infernal
fool
to
agree
to
his
blasted
conditions
he
growled
savagely
nonsense
said
thorndyke
if
you
had
broken
in
you
would
have
found
a
dead
man
as
it
was
you
found
a
live
man
and
obtained
an
important
statement
you
acted
quite
properly
how
do
you
suppose
he
managed
it
asked
badger
thorndyke
held
out
his
hand
let
us
look
at
his
cigarette
case
said
he
badger
extracted
the
little
silver
case
from
the
dead
man
pocket
and
opened
it
there
were
five
cigarettes
in
it
two
of
which
were
plain
while
the
other
three
were
thorndyke
took
out
one
of
each
kind
and
gently
pinched
their
ends
the
one
he
returned
the
plain
one
he
tore
through
about
a
quarter
of
an
inch
from
the
end
when
two
little
black
tabloids
dropped
out
on
to
the
table
badger
eagerly
picked
one
up
and
was
about
to
smell
it
when
thorndyke
grasped
his
wrist
be
careful
said
he
and
when
he
had
cautiously
sniffed
at
the
tabloid
held
at
a
safe
distance
from
his
nose
he
added
yes
potassium
cyanide
i
thought
so
when
his
lips
turned
that
queer
color
it
was
in
that
last
cigarette
you
can
see
that
he
has
bitten
the
end
off
for
some
time
we
stood
silently
looking
down
at
the
still
form
stretched
on
the
floor
presently
badger
looked
up
as
you
pass
the
porter
lodge
on
your
way
out
said
he
you
might
just
drop
in
and
tell
him
to
send
a
constable
to
me
very
well
said
thorndyke
and
by
the
way
badger
you
had
better
tip
that
sherry
back
into
the
decanter
and
put
it
under
lock
and
key
or
else
pour
it
out
of
the
window
gad
yes
exclaimed
the
inspector
i
glad
you
mentioned
it
we
might
have
had
an
inquest
on
a
constable
as
well
as
a
lawyer
gentlemen
if
you
are
off
we
went
out
and
left
him
with
his
prisoner
passive
enough
indeed
according
to
his
ambiguously
worded
promise
as
we
passed
through
the
gateway
thorndyke
gave
the
inspector
message
curtly
and
without
comment
to
the
gaping
porter
and
then
we
issued
forth
into
chancery
lane
we
were
all
silent
and
very
grave
and
i
thought
that
thorndyke
seemed
somewhat
moved
perhaps
jellicoe
last
intent
look
which
i
suspect
he
knew
to
be
the
look
of
a
dying
man
lingered
in
his
memory
as
it
did
in
mine
down
chancery
lane
he
spoke
for
the
first
time
and
then
it
was
only
to
ejaculate
poor
devil
jervis
took
him
up
he
was
a
consummate
villain
thorndyke
hardly
that
was
the
reply
i
should
rather
say
that
he
was
he
acted
without
malice
and
without
scruple
or
remorse
his
conduct
exhibited
a
passionateless
expediency
which
was
dreadful
because
utterly
unhuman
but
he
was
a
strong
man
a
courageous
man
and
i
had
been
better
pleased
if
it
could
have
been
ordained
that
some
other
hand
than
mine
should
let
the
axe
fall
thorndyke
compunction
may
appear
strange
and
inconsistent
but
yet
his
feeling
was
also
my
own
great
as
was
the
misery
and
suffering
that
this
inscrutable
man
had
brought
into
the
lives
of
those
i
loved
i
forgave
him
and
in
his
downfall
forgot
the
callous
relentlessness
with
which
he
had
pursued
his
evil
purpose
for
it
was
he
who
had
brought
ruth
into
my
life
who
had
opened
for
me
the
paradise
of
love
into
which
i
had
just
entered
and
so
my
thoughts
turned
away
from
the
still
shape
that
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
stately
old
room
in
inn
away
to
the
sunny
vista
of
the
future
where
i
should
walk
hand
in
hand
with
ruth
until
my
time
too
should
come
until
i
too
like
the
grim
lawyer
should
hear
the
solemn
evening
bell
bidding
me
put
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
silent
sea
