note
of
late
the
lure
of
the
south
seas
has
laid
its
gentle
spell
rather
overwhelmingly
upon
american
readers
to
be
unread
in
polynesiana
is
to
be
intellectually
in
the
face
of
this
avid
appetite
for
literature
one
may
well
imagine
the
satisfaction
of
a
publisher
when
offered
opportunity
of
association
with
such
an
expedition
as
that
of
the
kawa
an
association
involving
the
exclusive
privilege
of
publishing
the
manuscript
of
walter
traprock
himself
the
public
we
feel
is
entitled
to
a
frank
word
regarding
the
inception
of
this
volume
now
at
last
it
is
possible
to
withdraw
the
veil
of
secrecy
which
has
shrouded
the
undertaking
almost
until
the
date
of
publication
we
say
because
some
inklings
of
information
found
their
way
into
the
newspapers
early
this
summer
the
leak
we
have
reason
to
be
believe
is
traceable
to
a
marquesan
valet
who
was
shipped
at
papeete
to
fill
the
place
left
vacant
by
william
henry
thomas
the
strange
facts
surrounding
whose
desertion
are
recorded

today
reports
the
discovery
of
a
new
group
of
polynesian
islands
the
new
archipelago
has
been
named
the
filbert

because
of
the
extraordinary
quantity
of
nuts
of
that
name
found
there
according

before
the

society
data
concerning
his
explorations
the
telltale
newspaper
item
reproduced
above
outlines
the
story
behind
this
volume
what
is
not
made
clear
is
the
fact
that
the
entire
expedition
was
painstakingly
planned
many
months
ago
the
publishers
themselves
making
it
financially
possible
by
contracting
with
traprock
for
his
literary
output
provision
was
also
made
for
recording
every
phase
of
experience
and
discovery
with
this
in
view
traprock
literary
attainments
were
complemented
by
securing
as
his
companions
the
distinguished
american
artist
herman
swank
and
reginald
whinney
the
scientist
by
this
characteristic
bit
of
foresight
was
the
inclusive
and
authoritative
character
of

ordinary
occurrences
which
enlivened
the

months
of

and
ask
my
reader
to
transport
himself
with
me
to
a
corner
with
which
he
is
doubtless
already
familiar
namely
that
formed
by
the
intersection
of
the
equator
with
the
meridian
this
particular
angle
bears
the
same
relation
to
the
southern

that
the

it
was
precisely
noon
time
on
july
when
i
stood
on
the
corner
referred
to
and
strange
to
say
found
it
practically
deserted
to
be
more
accurate
i
stood
on
the
deck
of
my
auxiliary
yawl
the
kawa
and
she
the
kawa
wallowed
on
the
corner
mentioned
to
all
intents
and
purposes
our
ship
company
was
alone
we
had
the
comforting
knowledge
that
on
our
right
as
one
faced
the
bow
were
the
gilbert
and
marshall
groups
including
the
sandwiches
on
our
left
the

friendly
and

archipelagoes
back
of
us
the
marquesas

and
directly
on

course
the
carolines
and
solomons
celebrated
for
their
beautiful
women
footnote
see
song
of
solomon
king
james
version
but
we
were
becalmed
and
the
geographic
items
mentioned
were
for
the
time
being
thus
we
were
free
to
proceed
with
the
business
at
hand
namely
the
celebration
of
our
national
holiday
this
we
had
been
doing
for
several
hours
with
frequent
toasts
speeches
firecrackers
and
an
occasional
rocket
aimed
directly
at
the
eye
of
the
tropical
sun
captain
triplett
being
a
stickler
for
marine
etiquette
had
conditioned
that
there
should
be
no
liquor
consumed
except
when
the
sun
was
over
the
to
this
end
he
had
fitted
a
to
our
with
a
universal
joint
thus
enabling
us
to
keep
the
spar
directly
under
the
sun
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
consequently
our
celebration
was
proceeding
merrily
while
in
this
happy
and
isolated
condition
let
me
say
a
few
words
of
our
ship
company
having
already
mentioned
the
captain
i
will
dispose
of
him
first
captain
ezra
triplett
was
a
mariner
in
fact
he
was
i
think
the
mariner
i
have
ever
seen
he
had
been
bitten
according
to
his
own
tell
for
years
by
every
sort
of
insect
rodent
and
crustacean
in
existence
he
had
had
smallpox
and
three
touches
of
scurvy
each
of
these
blights
leaving
its
autograph
he
had
lost
one
eye
in
the
australian
bush
where
naturally
it
was
impossible
to
find
it
this
had
been
replaced
by
a
blue
marble
of
the
size
known
technically
as
an
giving
him
an
alert
appearance
which
had
first
attracted
me
by
nature
taciturn
he
was
always
willing
to
sit
up
all
night
as
long
as
the
gin
was
handy
an
excellent
trait
in
a
navigator
about
his
neck
he
wore
a
felt
bag
containing
ten
or
a
dozen
assorted
marbles
with
which
he
furnished
his
vacant
socket
according
to
his
fancy
and
the
effect
of
his
frequent
changes
was
both
unusual
and
diverting

illustration
note
captain
ezra
triplett
the
annals
of
maritime
history
will
never
be
complete
until
the
name
of
captain
ezra
triplett
of
new
bedford
massachusetts
receives
the
recognition
which
is
justly
its
for
more
than
ten
generations
the
forebears
of
this
mariner
have
followed
the
sea
in
its
various
ramifications
the
first
triplett
was
one
of
the
companions
of
goswold
who
in
wintered
on
cuttyhunk
island
in
buzzard
bay
from
then
on
the
members
of
this
hardy
new
england
family
have
earned
positions
of
trust
and
honor
by
courage
and
perseverance
the
subject
of
this
portrait
has
worked
himself
up
from
cabin
boy
on
the
sound
steamer
wrecked
on
bartlett
reef
to
his
present
position
of
commander
of
the
kawa
of
his
important
part
in
connection
with
the
historic
cruise
described
in
these
pages
the
kawa
owner
traprock
has
no
hesitancy
in
saying
frankly
without
triplett
the
thing
never
could
have
been
done
the
accompanying
photograph
was
taken
just
after
the
captain
had
been
hauled
out
of
the
surf
in
papeete
it
will
be
remarked
that
he
still
maintains
an
indomitable
front
and
holds
his
trusty
colt
in
readiness
for
immediate
action
but
sail
lord
bless
you
how
triplett
could
sail
it
was
wizardry
sheer
wizardry
the
natives
used
to
call
it
triplett
blindfolded
could
find
the
inlet
to
a
hermetically
sealed
atoll
when
there
was
any
inlet
he
would
wait
for
a
seventh
wave
which
is
always
extra
large
and
take
her
over
on
the
crest
disregarding
the
ragged
coral
below
the
kawa
was
a
tight
little
craft
built
for
rough
work
she
stood
up
nobly
under
the
punishment
her
skipper
gave
her
triplett
assistant
was
an
individual
named
william
henry
thomas
a
retired
connecticut
farmer
who
had
chosen
to
end
his
days
at
sea
this
it
should
be
remarked
is
the
reverse
of
the
usual
order
the
of
connecticut
are
peopled
by
retired
who
have
gone
back
to
the
land
which
accounts
in
large
measure
for
the
condition
of
agriculture
in
these
communities
william
henry
thomas
had
appeared
as
triplett
selection
once
aboard
ship
his
land
habits
stood
him
in
good
stead
in
his
various
duties
as
cook
butler
and
valet
for
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
the
kawa
tight
though
she
might
be
was
without

years
we
had
been
at

when
our
fathers
were
working
our
way
through
college
how
far
away
it
all
seemed
on
that
torrid
fourth
of
july
as
we
sat
on
the
kawa
deck
singing
oralee
to
which
we
had
taught
triplett
the
bass
like
a
blackbird
in
the
spring
chanting
very
said
whinney
a
blackbird
in
the
spring
very
we
laughed
feebly
suddenly
as
they
do
in
the
tropics
an
extraordinary
thing
happened
a
simoon
a
monsoon
and
a
typhoon
met
head
on
at
the
exact
corner
of
the
equator
and
the
meridian
we
had
noticed
one
of
them
they
had
given
us
no
warning
or
signal
of
any
kind
before
we
knew
it
they
were
upon
us
i
have
been
in
any
one
of
the
three
separately
many
a
time
in
off
the
blue
canary
islands
i
was
caught
in
an
octoroon
one
of
those
storms
that
spun
our
ship
around
like
a
top
and
killed
all
the
canaries
for
miles
about
the
sea
was
strewn
with
their
bodies
but
this
below
bellowed
captain
triplett
and
we
made
a
dive
for
the
hatch
william
henry
thomas
was
the
last
in
having
been
in
the
bow
setting
off
a
pinwheel
when
the
blow
hit
us
we
dragged
him
in
my
last
memory
is
of
triplett
driving
a
nail
back
of
the
to
keep
it
from
sliding
how
long
we
were
whirled
in
that
devil
grip
of
the
elements
i
can
not
say
it
may
have
been
a
day
it
may
have
been
a
week
we
were
all
below
battened
down
tight
at
times
we
lost
consciousness
at
times
we
were
sick
at
times
both
i
remember
standing
on
face
and
peering
out
through
a
at
a
world
of
waterspouts
as
thick
as
forest
trees
dancing
melting
crashing
upon
us
i
sank
back
was
the
illustration
a
bewildered
botanist
illustration
note
a
bewildered
botanist
here
against
the
background
of
a
closely
woven
hedge
of
southern
hornbeam
we
see
that
eminent
scientist
reginald
whinney
in
the
act
of
discovering
for
the
first
time
in
any
country
a
magnificent
specimen
of
wild
modesty
which
grows
in
great
profusion
throughout
the
filbert
islands
this
tiny
floweret
is
distantly
related
by
marriage
to
the
european
sensitive
plant
but
is
infinitely
more
sensitive
and
reticent
an
illustration
of
this
amazing
quality
is
found
in
the
fact
that
its
snowy
blossoms
blush
a
deep
crimson
under
the
gaze
of
the
human
eye
at
the
touch
of
the
human
hand
the
flowers
turn
and
shrink
to
minute
proportions
whinney
attempted
in
vain
to
transplant
specimens
of
this
fragile
creation
to
our
botanical
gardens
but
found
the
conditions
of
modern
plant
life
an
insuperable
barrier
the
seeds
of
wild
modesty
absolutely
refuse
to
germinate
in
either
europe
or
america
calm
peace
and
sun
the
beneficence
of
a
warm
golden
finger
that
reached
gently
through
the
and
rested
on
my
eye
what
had
happened
oh
yes
like
a
blackbird
in
the
spring
slowly
i
fought
my
way
back
to
consciousness
triplett
was
sitting
in
a
corner
still
clutching
the
hammer
on
the
floor
lay
whinney
and
william
henry
thomas
their
twisted
legs
horribly
suggestive
of
death
air
i
gasped
triplett
feebly
wrenched
out
the
nail
and
we
managed
to
pull
the
hatch
far
enough
back
to
squeeze
through
enlivened
by
the
fresh
air
the
others
crawled
slowly
after
except
poor
william
henry
thomas
who
still
lay
inert
he
all
right
said
whinney
the
gin
bottle
broke
and
dripped
into
his
mouth
he
come
to
presently
he
added
in
an
undertone
the
wages
of
gin
whinney
was
always
quoting
minus
our
factotum
we
stood
and
silently
surveyed
what
once
had
been
the
kawa
the
leathern
features
of
captain
triplett
twisted
into
a
grin
bald
a

we
knotted
our

be

efforts
made

should
say
about
eight
knots
an
hour
but
half
of
them
pulled
out
at
the
least
provocation
we
persevered
however
and
finally
completed
our
task
nor
were
we
an
instant
too
soon
for
just
as
we
had
succeeded
in
getting
the
oars
to
stand
upright

were
anxiously
watching

out

the
sun
which
for
the
last
hour
had
hung
above
the
horizon
suddenly
fell
into

and
night
was
upon
us
there
that
said
whinney
quietly
thus
we
slid
through
the
velvet
night
with
the
double
cross
hanging
low
by
south
it
must
have
been
about
an
hour
before
dawn
that
a
shiver
of
expectancy
thrilled
us
unanimously
did
you
hear
that
sir
said
captain
triplett
in
a
low
tone
no
what
was
it
a
we
must
be
near

there
it
is
again
i
heard
it
that
time
the
faint
sweet
note

afterward
we
heard
the
mewing

a
evidently
chasing

enough

somehow
we
felt
sure
of
it
in
calm
elation
and
tired
expectancy
we
strained
our
eyes
through
the
slow
crescendo
of
the
day
birth
suddenly
the
sun
leaped
over
the
horizon
and
the
long
crimson
rays
flashed
forward
to
where
dead
ahead
we
could
see
a
faint
swelling
on
the
skyline

cried
in
voices

strangled
joy

disappointment

we
had

finding
any

everywhere
these
had
been
abandoned
either
the

had
given
out
or
the
polyps
had
gotten
to
squabbling
among

left
their

our
fourth
of

celebration
as
we
sat
cozily
on
deck
sipping
our

it
slowly
dawned
on
us
that
we
had
made
the
amazing
discovery
of
an
absolutely
new
type
of
island
something
so
evidently
virgin
and
unvisited
that
we
could
only
gaze
in
silence

could

believe
it
the
islands
lay
before
us
in
echelon
formation
the
one
in
our
immediate
foreground
was
typical
of
the
others
its
plan
was
that
of
a
circle
of
beach
and
palm
enclosing
an
inner
sea
from
the
center
of
which
rose
an
elaborate
mountain
to
a
sheer
height
of
two
thousand
perhaps
ten
thousand
feet
the
general
effect
was
that
of
a
pastry
masterpiece
on
a
gigantic
scale
footnote
oddly
enough
the
scene
struck
me
as
strangely
familiar
but
it
was
not
until
weeks
afterward
that
i
recalled
its
prototype
in
the
memory
of
a
decoration
worn
by
general
grosdenovitch
minister
to
america
from
montenegro
just
before
the
little

blew
up
with

could
only
stare
in

with
the
thought
that
we
were
actually
discoverers
a
gorgeous
feature
of
our
find
in
addition
to
its
satisfactory
shape
was
its
color
sand
and
vegetation
were
of
the
conventional
hues
but
where
the
flanks
of
the
rock
rose
from
the
enclosed
pool
we
observed
that
they
were
of
the
pure
elementary
colors
red
blue
and
yellow
fresh
and
untarnished
as
in
the
latest
masterpiece
from
the

is
our
inexperience
in

that
a

must
invariably
be
described
in

by
reason
of
a

by

the

was
listening

thrilling
cry
of

captain

had
just
requested

i
now
come
to
the
strangest
feature
of
all
i
refer
to
its
sound
i
had
for
some
time
noticed
a
queer
dripping
noise
which
i
had
foreborne
to
mention
fearing
it
might
be
inside
my

head
a
devilish
legacy
of
our
recent
buffeting
you
can
imagine
my
relief
when
whinney
asked
apologetically
do
you
fellows
hear
anything
i
do
was
my
rejoinder
seconded
by
swank
who
had
come
up
for
air
we
all
listened
intently
though
the
sky
was
cloudless
a
distinct
pattering
sound
as
of
a
light
rain
reached
us

said
captain
triplett
suddenly
spitting
on
the
nose
of
a

that
had
made
a
face
at
him

glance
through
our
mercifully
preserved

the
captain
vision
for
the
love
of
pete
i
gasped
take
a
squint
at
those
trees
they
were
literally
crawling
with
nuts
and
tropical
fruits
of
every
description
in
the
shadow
of
the
broad
panjandrus
leaves
we
could
see
whole
loaves
of
breadfruits
falling
unassisted
to
the
ground
while
between
the
heavier
thuds
of
cocoanuts
and
grapefruit
we
heard
the
incessant
patter
of
light
showers
of
thousands
of
assorted
nutlets
singing
the
everlasting
burden
and
refrain
of
these
audible
isles
it
was
this
predominant
feature
though
i
anticipate
our
actual
decision
which
ultimately
settled
our
choice
of
a
name
for
the
new
archipelago
the
filbert
islands
now
famous
wherever
the
names
of
whinney
swank
and
traprock
are
known
it
was
now
about
two
bells
and
an
excellent
time
to
make
a
landing
preparations
for
which
were
forthwith
set
in
motion
now
if
ever
we
had
occasion
to
bless
the
tightness
of
the
kawa
for
in
the
confusion
below
somewhat
ameliorated
by
the
labors
of
william
henry
thomas
we
found
most
of
our
duffle
in
good
order
an
occasional
stethoscope
broken
or
a
cork
loose
but
nothing
to
amount
to
much
our
rifles

and
my
bundles

were
as

as
ever

was
thankful
as

had
counted
on

on
the

of

a

had
run
amuck
among

but
in

we
were
intact
after
some
delay
in
getting

on

due
to
whinney
contention
that
the

and

we
finally
shoved
off
leaving
william
henry
thomas
to
answer
the
door
in
case
of
callers
in
the
brief
interval
of
our
passage
i
could
not
help
noticing
the
remarkable
submarine
flora
over
which
we
passed
the
water
perfectly
clear
to
a
depth
of

feet
showed
a
remarkable
picture
of
aquatic
forestry
under
our
keel
spread
limeaceous
trees
of
myriad
hues
in
whose
branches
perched
variegated
fish
nibbling
the
coral
buds
or
thoughtfully
scratching
their
backs
on
the
roseate
bark
pearls
the
size
of
onions
rolled
aimlessly
on

floor
but
of
these
later
for
the
nonce
our
tale
leads
landward
as
our
canvas
scraped
the
shingle
we
leaped
out
tossing
the
dory
lightly
beyond
the
reach
of
the
waves
and
fell
into
the
formation

i
have

just
off
the
fairway
of

third

at

into
this
we
proceeded
gingerly
intrepid
and
alert
but
ready
to
bolt
at
the
slightest
alarm
the
nut
noises
became
constantly
more
ominous
and
menacing
but
still
we
saw
no
sign
of
human
life
near
the
edge
of
the
forest
we
came
to
a
halt
plainly
it
would
be
unwise
to
venture
within
range
of
the
arboreal
hailstones
without
protection
for
though
our
were
of
the
best
quality
they
were
after
all
but
pith
and
a

is
a
cocoanut
the
world
over
while
we
were
debating
this
point
and
seeking
a
possible
way
into
the
jungle
which
was
not
overarched
by
trees
i
heard
a
low
as
i
supposed
the
of
the
cuttywink
on
the
instant
a
towering
circle
of
dark
forms
sprang
from
the
haro
and
at
a
glance
i
saw
that
we
were
completely
surrounded
by
gigantic
filbertines
darting
a
look
over
my
shoulder
i
noted
to
my
dismay
an
enormous
towing
our
dory
seaward
it
was
a
harrowing
moment
as
agreed
upon
we
waited
for
triplett
to
take
the
initiative
and
in
the
interim
i
took
a
hasty
inventory
of
our
reception
committee
the
general
impression
was
that
of
great
beauty
and
physique
entirely
unadorned
except
for
a
narrow
beaded
and
pendent
apron
in
the
filbertine
language
consisting
of
a
clam
shell
decorated
with
brightly
colored
the
men
faces
were
calm
almost
benign
and
as
far
as
i
could
see
unarmed
except
for
long
sharply
pointed
bundles
of
leaves
which
they
carried
under
their
arms
their
tattooing
was
the
finest
i
have
ever
seen
at
this
moment
however
my
observations
were
concluded
by
suddenly
wheeling
and
saying
sharply
traprock
target
practice
this
was
a
stunt
we
had
often
performed
for
the
amusement
and
mystification
of
kindly
cannibals
in
the
solomons
i
had
seen
it
in
vaudeville
and
taught
it
to
triplett
as
was
my
custom
i
had
in
the
pocket
of
my
singlet
a
number
of
ship
biscuit
plucking
out
one
of
these
i
placed
it
on
my
forehead
and
nose
holding
it
in
place
with
the
index
finger
triplett
leveled
his
colt
a
good
yard
above
my
head
and
fired
i
on
the
instant
pressing
the
biscuit
so
that
it
fell
in
pieces
to
the
ground
the
effect
on
the
filbertines
was
marvelous
they
were
too
simple
to
be
afraid
their
one
emotion
was
wonder
then
swank
grinning
broadly
uttered
the
one
word
cinch
to
a
nation
which
had
never
heard
a
word
ending
in
a
consonant
this
was
apparently
intensely
humorous
they
burst
into
loud
guffaws
supplemented
with
resounding
slaps
of
their
cupped
hands
on
their
stomachs
at
the
same
time
raising
an
imitative
cry
of
this
was
our
welcome
to
the
filbert
islands
and
also
the
beginning
of
the
formation
of
that
new
tongue

arrive
at
the
capitol
a
lecture
on
filbertine
architecture
a
strange
taboo
the
serenade
with
the
first
burst
of
laughter
it
seemed
that
all
embarrassment
on
the
part
of
the
natives
had
been
dissipated
those
nearest
us
insisted
on
patting
our
stomachs
gently
at
the
same
time
uttering
a
soft
crooning

this
same
sound
is
used
by
the
natives
of
sugar
hill
new
hampshire
when
calming
their
horses
which
it
was
obviously
the
proper
thing
to
return
which
we
did
to
the
delight
of
the
bronze
warriors
about
us
after
a
few
moments
of
this
friendly
massage

ornamental

i
judged
to

slapped
his
right
thigh
smartly
with
his
left
hand
a
feat
more
easily
described
than
accomplished
coincident
with
this
signal
came
a
cheerful
riffling
sound
as
the
filbertines
broke
out
their
large
umbrellas
of
panjandrus
leaves
which
we
had
first
mistaken
for
weapons
this
implement
known
technically
as
a
or
depending
on
whether
it
was
open
or
closed
was
in
reality
notonly
a
useful
and
necessary
protection
against
the
continuous
but
also
a
weapon
of
both
and
warfare
footnote
this
primitive
people
we
soon
found
to
be
profoundly
pacifistic
a
natural
condition
in
a
race
who
since
the
dawn
of
time
had
known
no
influence
other
than
that
of
the
pacific
ocean
warfare
with
its
cruel
attributes
had
never
penetrated
their
isolation
with
nations
as
with
people
it
takes
two
to
make
a
quarrel
here
was
but
one
we
stood
thus
in
open
formation
among
the
luxurious
haro
until
in
response
to
another
signal
from
the
chief
a
resounding
slap
on
the
left
shank
they
escorted
us
ceremoniously
along
a
winding
path
which
led
toward
the
interior
of
the
island
it
was
for
all
the
world
as
if
we
were
being
taken
out
to
dinner
a
thought
which
suggested
for
an
instant
the
reflection
that
we
might
turn
out
to
be
not
but
at
the
banquet
in
which
case
i
promised
myself
i
should
be
a
of
the
most
violent
character
but
these
solemn
thoughts
were
not
proof
against
the
gaiety
of
our
surroundings
the
soft
patter
of
the
constantly
dropping
nuts
bounding
from
the
protective
and
the
squawks
and
screeches
of
countless
cuttywinks
and
birds
those
queens
of
the
tropics
whose
gorgeous
plumage
swept
across
our
path
for
whinney
and
swank
as
well
as
myself
the
promenade
was
a
memorable
one
the
former
feasting
his
cool
eyes
on
the
hundreds
of
new
scientific
items
which
he
was
later
to
classify
the

of

the

the

flashed
their

we
passed

us

reflected
no
interest
whatever
in

it
was
doubtless
this
unintelligent
dignity
on
our
captain
part
coupled
with
what
was
left
of
his
brass
buttons
and
visor
cap
on
which
the
legend
kawa
still
glimmered
faintly
which
prompted
the
aborigines
to
select
him
as
our
chief
an
error
which
i
at
first
thought
of
correcting
by
some
sort
of
dramatic
tableau
such
as
having
triplett
lie
down
and
letting
me
place
my
foot
on
his
adam
apple
of
which
he
had
a
splendid
specimen
on
second
thought
however
i
decided
that
it
would
be
more
modest
to
allow
him
any
honors
he
might
receive
together
with
the
responsibilities
attendant
upon
his
position
it
is
the
invariable
habit
of
south
sea
islanders
in
the
event
of
trouble
to
capture
and
hold
as
hostages
the
chief
men
of
a
tribe
their
heads
with
or
without
the
original
bodies
seem
to
have
a
peculiar
value

curious
implement
which
serves
so
many
purposes
in
the
filbert
group
it
is
in
turn
a
protection
against
the
sun
the
rain
and
the
constant
showers
of
falling

also
when

to
its
other

it
is
most
evidently
a
charming
background
for
a
splendid
example
of
filbertine
youth
and
beauty
soon
the
trail
widened
and
we
were
called
upon
to
hurdle
several
low
barriers
of
designed
to
confine
the
activities
of
the
countless
which
whined
plaintively
about
our
feet
at
a
majestic
gesture
from
the
chief
the

furled
becoming
and
we
halted
in
a
bright
clearing
about
sixty
feet
in
diameter
plainly
the
public
square
or
to
be
exact
circle
my
first
impression
was
that
of
complete
isolation
in
an
unbroken
forest
peer
as
i
would
i
could
discern
no
sign
of
human
habitation
we
had
arrived
but
where
my
question
was
soon
answered
by
most
gracious
gestures
soft
sounds
and
a
series
of
fluttering
finger
exercises
on
the
abdominal
walls
we
were
led
to
one
side
of
the
circle
where
as
our
guides
pointed
upward
white
eyes
for
the
first
time
in
history
rested
on
a
filbertine
dwelling
the
houses
were
in
the
trees
architecture
is
said
to
express
deeply
the
inner
characteristics
of
a
people
a
statement
i
am
glad
to
corroborate
but
never
had
it
struck
me
so
forcibly
as
now
gazing
up
at
a
dim
picture
of
informal
construction
interlaced
and
blended
with
the
trunks
boughs
and
foliage
of
the
overarching
palms
i
saw
at
a
glance
the
of
the
life
of
this
simple
people
of
the
houses
nests
were
the
better
word
were
formed
by
a
most
naive
adaptation
of
natural
surroundings
to
natural
needs
the
curving
fronds
of
the
towering
and
panjandrus
had
been
interlaced
and
nature
did
the
rest
the
gigantic
leaves
interweaving
blending
meeting
in
a
passionate
and
successful
desire
to
form
a
roof
proof
alike
against
sun
and
rain
some
ten
feet
below
this
and
an
equal
distance
from
the
ground
the
tendrils
of
the
vine
had
been
led
from
tree
to
tree
the
subordinate
fibres
and
palpitating
feelers
quickly
knitting
themselves
into
a
floor
with
all
the
hygienic
properties
and
tensile
strength
of
access
to
these
apartments
was
something
of
a
puzzle
until
to
instruct
us
a
tall
filbert
who
was
evidently
to
be
our
neighbor
approached
a
nearby
dwelling
and
seizing
a
pendent
halyard
of
gently
but
firmly
pulled
down
the
floor
to
a
convenient
level
vaulted
into
the
depression
and
was
immediately
snapped
into
privacy
from
below
we
could
see
the
imprint
of
his
form
rolling
toward
the
center
of
his
and
then
the
depressions
of
his
feet
as
he
proceeded
to
lurch
about
his
dwelling
it
was
now
we
were
hot
tired
and
though
we
did
not
know
it
mildly
intoxicated
by
the
inhalations
of
alova
which
we
had
absorbed
during
our
journey
i
looked
forward
eagerly
to
getting
so
to
speak
and
taking
a
sound
nap
one
thing
only
deterred
me
i
was
thirsty

the
intensity
alertness
and
intrepidity
which
have
carried
this

through
so
many
harrowing
experiences
a
certain
bold
defiance

just
this

that

now

this
is
also
true
of
dr
traprock
on
the
edge
of
the
clearing
i
heard
the
tinkling
of
a
brook
walking
to
its
edge
i
knelt
and
dipped
my
hot
wrists
in
the
cold
stream
wetting
my
hands
face
and
matted
locks
while
the
natives
eyed
me
solemnly
but
with
i
thought
looks
of
anxiety
and
then
a
strange
thing
happened
as
i
took
off
my
fishing
hat
filled
it
to
the
brim
and
raised
it
to
my
lips
a
cry
of
horror
burst
from
the
throats
of
those
swarthy
giants
the
chief
strode
forward
and
dashed
the
cap
from
my
hand
at
the
same
time
thundering
the
word
bapoo
in
an
instant
it
flashed
upon
me
that
this
was
filbertese
for
or
that
strange
sacred
kibosh
which
is
laid
on
certain
acts
objects
or
localities
throughout
these
islands
water
it
appeared
was
for
drinking
purposes
i
then
did
what
i
think
was
exactly
the
right
thing
under
the
circumstances
namely
to
wring
out
the
offending
and
throw
it
as
far
from
me
as
possible
an
act
which
was
greeted
with
a
hearty
burst
of
applause
it
was
not
necessary
for
me
to
indicate
further
that
i
was
thirsty
two
henchmen
almost
immediately
appeared
with
a
large
of
unfamiliar
appearance
it
was
about
the
size
of
a
half
watermelon
and
bright
red
on
the
outside
full
of
a
pale
pink
liquid
the
chief
one
or
two
of
the
leading
men
and
the
rest
of
my
party
were
similarly
equipped
raising
his
shell
the
chief
and
nobles
said
simultaneously
and
we
drank
two
minutes
afterward
i
had
a
faint
sensation
of
being
borne
away
by
the
trade
wind
swank
was
beside
me
and
i
heard
him
murmur
i
glad
i
do
have
to
sleep
with
triplett
the
rest
was
silence
and
the
silence
was
rest
we
awoke
many
hours
later
it
was
moonlight
and
we
were
lying
in
a
complicated
knot
in
the
exact
center
of
our
domicile
unraveling
ourselves
we
tested
our
heads
with
gentle
oscillations
suddenly
in
the
distance
we
heard
a
sound
which
sent
a
chill
thrill
running
up
and
down
our
spines
the
sound
of
singing
a
faint
chorus
of
the
loveliest
voices
that
ever
fell
on
mortal
ears
the
tone
had
that
marvelous
silver
clang
of
the
woodland
thrush
with
yet
a
deeper
human
poignancy
a
note
of
passionate
longing
and
endearment
shy
but
assertive
wild
but
oh
so
alluring
we
chinned
ourselves
expectantly
on
the
edge
of
our
floor
and
waited
panting
a
serenade
whispered
swank
and
whinney
him
savagely
through
the
forest
glades
we
could
see
the
choir
approaching
the
dusky
flash
of
brown
bodies
swaying
palpitating
to
the
intoxicating
rhythm
of
the
song
slowly
and
with
great
dignity
they
entered
the
clearing
and
stood
a
score
of
slender
creatures
in
the
full
blaze
of
the
moon
their
bodies
clad
only
in
delicate
thus
standing
they
again
burst
into
the
melody

their
national

transcribe
the
original
words
which
for
simple
primitive
beauty
are
without
rival
and
sometimes
and
the
music
is
indescribable
i
can
only
say
that
it
is
as
beautiful
as
the
words

on
the
third
encore
they
turned
and
slowly
but
surely
filed
out
of
the
clearing
into
the
forest
long
after
they
had
disappeared
our
eyes
still
hung
over
the
edge
of
our
apartment
and
we
could
hear
in
our
memories
the
sweet
refrain
as
we
lay
there

trance

about

it
was
no

lowered
ourselves
into

drifted
into
delicious
languorous
reveries

but
alas
how
easy
it
is
to
put
things
off
day
after
day
slipped
by
and
we
thought

less
of

more

more
of
what
a

were
having

was
to
simple

beauties
how
much
more
interesting
than
our
own
meaningless
nomenclature
we
soon
found
that
these
simple
folk
had
evolved
an
admirable
standard
day
in
which
there
was
no
labor
whatever
no
cooking
even
imagine
a
civilization
and
i
use
the
word
advisedly
in
which
the
question
of
having
or
not
having
a
cook
is
eliminated
we
were
two
weeks
on
the
island
before
any
one
of
us
realized
that
we
had
seen
no
fire
the
matches
which
we
used
to
light
our
pipes
were
thought
to
be
marvelous
flowers
that
blossomed
and
immediately
disappeared
nature
all
bountiful
supplied
a
menu
of
amazing
variety
fruits
vegetables
combinations
of
the
two
edible
flowers
and
above
all
the
thousand
and
one
kinds
of
nuts
from
which
the
islands
receive
their
name
were
at
hand
for
the
plucking
our
breakfast
grew
on
the
ceiling
of
our
bedroom
and
dropped
beside
us
with
charming
punctuality
at
the
first
shiver
of
the
rising
trade
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
we
were
strict
vegetarians
many
varieties
of
fish
and
crustacea
as
well
as
certain
insects
and
some
of
the
smaller
birds
were
eaten
raw
european
and
american
civilizations
alike
are
hopelessly
backward
in
this
regard
true
we
eat
with
avidity
oysters
and
clams
except
in
the
knowing
that
they
are
not
only
raw
but
also
alive
in
the
filberts
it
was
but
a
slight
step
forward
to
pop
into
one
mouth
a
wriggling
a
kind
of
marine
lizard
whose
antics
after
he
is
swallowed
are
both
pleasant
and
novel
the
hors
course
of
a
filbert
island
banquet
is
one
roar
of
laughter
caused
by
the
interior
tickling
of
the
agile
food
this
of
course
promotes
good
feeling
and
leads
to
many
lasting
friendships
with
one
meals
thus
always
with
no
cook
glowering
at
the
clock
no
cheese
souffle
ready
to
collapse
no
dishes
to
wash
or
to
scour
life
is
one
long
gastronomic
song
in
physical
stature
and
beauty
the
filbertines
are
far
above
the
average
the
men
are
six
feet
in
height
and
upwards
and
proportionately
wide
by
a
combination
of
equable
climatic
and
economic
conditions
this
altitude
has
become
standardized
and
there
is
little
variation
from
it
a
sort
of
rough
control
is
exercised
in
this
regard
when
a
young
male
filbertine
has
got
his
growth
he
is
measured
with
a
bamboo
yardstick
to
see
if
he
comes
up

requirements
if
not
he
simply
disappears
little
is
said
about
it
but
the
fact
is
that
the
physical
failures
are
moored
at
low
tide
to
a
lump
of
coral
on
one
of
the
outer
reefs
sharks
octopi
and
the

the
rest
this
as
i
say
is
a
rough
sort
of

gathering
on
the
outer
reef
there
is
no
pleasanter
sight
in
the
world
than
that
of
the
stalwart
young
filbertine
youths
gathering
in
the
early
dawn
of
a
perfect
tropical
day
it
is
only
at
this
time
that
these
edible
little
creatures
can
be
caught
just
as
the
sun
rays
flash
across
the
horizon
they
rise
to
the
surface
of
the
water
in
vast
numbers
turning
the
entire
ocean
to
a
pulsating
mirror
of
silver
for
five
minutes
they
lie
thus
then
suddenly
sink
simultaneously
their
work
for
the
day
so
far
as
we
know
it
is
done
the
natives
fill
their
cheeks
which
are
very
elastic
with
hundreds
of
these
tiny
fish
which
they
afterwards
eject
on
the
shore
here
we
see
and
ablutiluti
gathering
for
the
great
feast
given
in
honor
of
traprock
and
his
companions
in
facial
character
the
tribe
is
regular
and
well
proportioned
presenting
no
traces
of
negroid
antecedents
noses
are
slender
and
slightly
retroussed
lips
chins
modestly
assertive
with
lower
jaws
superbly
adapted
to
cracking
cocoanuts
and
oysters
foreheads
low
with
sufficient
projection
at
the
for
shade
purposes
all
in
all
they
are
entitled
to
an
in
beauty
and
reminded
me
less
of
polynesians
than
of
a
selection
of
caucasians
who
had
been
coated
with
a
radiator
paint
beards
moustaches
imperials
goatees
and
galways
are
unknown
a
fact
which
was
to
me
strange
considering
the
luxuriance
of
other
vegetation
until
i
learned
that
from
infancy
it
is
the
custom
of
the
filbertine
mother
to
scour
her
offspring
face
with
powdered
coral
which
discourages
the
facial
follicles
these
eventually
give
up
and
turning
inward
and
upward
result
in
a
veritable
crown
of
glory
on
the
top
of
the
head
the
place
after
all
where
the
hair
ought
to
grow
their
teeth
as
with
most
gramnivora
are
sound
regular
brilliantly
white
and
exceptionally
large
the
average
size
being
that
of
the
domino
so
much
for
the
men
and
far
too
much
if
you
ask
me
when
you
think
that
we
still
have
the
adorable
women
to
speak
of
ever
since
our
first
nocturnal
glimpse
of
the
charming
creatures
you
can
imagine
that
my
companions
and
i
were
most
eager
to
see
more
of
them
during
the
entire
next
day
not
one
of
les
belles
sauvages
was
visible
it
was
next
to
impossible
to
make
inquiries
but
swank
the
irrepressible
resolved
to
try
and
plied
baahaabaa
with
questions
in
french
english
german
and
which
only
resulted
in
loud
laughter
on
the
part
of
our
host
swank
next
tried
pantomime
using
the
french
gesture
for
beauty
a
circular
motion
of
the
hands
about
his
face
accompanied
by
sickening
smiles
baahaabaa
watched
him
intently
slapped
his
hip
sharply
uttering
a
melodious
command
and
shortly
afterward
presented
swank
with
a
beautifully
made
wreath
of
elecampane
blossoms
exactly
matching
his
beard
this
was
all
very
well
but
got
us
nowhere
on
the
day
following
however
our
difficulties
were
unexpectedly
solved
abluluti
and
a
companion
of
his
moolitonu
indicated
by
certain
large
gestures
that
if
we
liked
they
would
be
glad
to
make
a
tour
of
the
island
a
proposition
we
gladly
accepted
moolitonu
was
our
official
map
on
his
broad
back
in
the
most
exquisite
azure
tattooing
was
a
diagram
of
the
island
showing
all
good
and
bad
trails
and
points
of
interest
moolitonu
was
in
fact
a
human
equipped
with
individual
and
quart
cocoanut
shells
of
a
delicious
per
cent
milk
we
set
out
along
a
trail
stopping
ever
and
anon
to
enjoy
the
tranquil
beauty
of
the
outer
sea
or
the
more
spectacular
glimpses
of
the
inner
lagoon
dominated
by
the
mountain
we
had
made
the
circuit
of
approximately
of
the
island
when
suddenly
without
a
word
of
warning
we
stumbled
into
the
or
instantly
we
were
surrounded
by
a
bevy
of
captivating
beauties
our
guides
had
evidently
counted
on
our
surprise
for
they
laughed
uproariously
their
mirth
being
joyously
echoed
by
the
graceful
women
who
crowded
about
us
patting
petting
and
bidding
us
unmistakable
welcome
to
their
compound

never

in
the

new
york
city
it
is
hardly
necessary
to
introduce
by
name
the
illustrious
artist
who
has
justly
earned
the
title
of
premier
painter
of
polynesia
a
whole
school
of
painters
have
attempted
to
reproduce
the
exotic
color
and
charm
of
these
entrancing
isles
it
remained
for
herman
swank
by
his
now
famous
method
of
diagrammatic
symbolism
to
bring
the
truth
fully
home
this
he
accomplished
by
living
to
the
limit
the
native
life
of
the
filbertese
clad
only
in
the
light
lamitu
or
afternoon
wrap
of
the
islands
it
was
the
custom
to
spend
entire
days
inhaling
the
perfume
of
the
fragment
alova
flower
a
practice
which
undoubtedly
accounts
for
the
dreamy
expression
so
evident
in
the
photograph
he
is
also
wearing
the
paloota
or
wedding
crown
the
gift
of
his
lovely
island
bride
let
me
briefly
outline
the
filbertine
domestic
arrangements
as
they
were
gradually
unfolded
to
us
to
begin
with
make
no
mistake
marriage
in
the
filbert
islands
is
a
distinct
success
this
is
accomplished
by
the
almost
complete
separation
of
the
husband
from
his
wives
during
the
day
these
joyous
maids
and
matrons
lead
their
own
lives
in
their
own
community
rehearsing
their
songs
weaving
chaplets
of
flowers
stringing
pearls
for
their
simple
costumes
playing
games
and
exchanging
the
badinage
and
gossip
which
are
the
of
womanhood
the
world
over
they
are
inordinately
proud
of
their
hair
as
well
they
may
be
and
spend
hours
at
a
time
dressing
and
undressing
it
the
men
on
their
side
are
equally
free
the
result
is
that
a
meeting
with
their
wives
is
an
event
happiness
love
and
the
elation
of
celebration
are
the
harmonious
notes
of
this
beautiful
domestic
diapason
banquets
picnics
swimming
parties
the
filbertines
adore
salt
water
which
is
not
potable
but
these
are
the
occasions
of
a
frank
and
joyous
mingling
of
the
sexes
before
we
left
the
clearing
we
were
treated
to
a
most
graceful
spectacle
a
performance
of
the
a
dance
descriptive
of
the
growth
and
blossoming
of
the
flower
this
was
performed
by
seven
beautiful
girls
to
an
accompaniment
of
song
and
clapping
the
plaintive
was
unmistakably
introduced
by
a
dame
who
played
on
the
a
primitive
instrument
fashioned
from
the
stalk
of
the
figwort
it
may
interest
music
lovers
to
know
that
the
filbertines
employ
the
diatetic
scale
exclusively
four
notes
in
the
ascent
and
five
on
the
recoil
at
the
close
of
the
performance
we
were
shown
the
nursery
compound
an
enclosure
teeming
with
beautiful
children
screened
by
hedges
where
the
little
ones
could
be
heard
but
not
seen
two
days
subsequent
to
our
amble
we
were
invited
to
a
grand
banquet
which
led
to
disturbing
problems
and
momentous
decision
on
our
part
this
feast
was
our
formal
welcome
the
keys
of
the
islands
so
to
speak
were
presented
to
us
there
were
ladies
present
and
everything
it
was
served
in
a
special
clearing
lighted
by
the
moon
and
countless
tied
by
their
legs
in
festoons
a
procedure
which
causes
them
to
open
and
shut
their
lambent
eyes
very
rapidly
and
gave
a
quaint
cinema
effect
to
the
scene
after
counting
the
courses
up
to
i
lost
as
each
was
accompanied
by
a
new
brand
of
island
potion
fortunately
we
were
seated
on
the
ground
triplett
was
in
his
glory
if
i
have
failed
to
mention
recently
our
old
navigator
it
is
only
because
we
had
seen
comparatively
little
of
him
resting
on
his
titular
dignity
as
chief
he
seldom
appeared
in
public
spending
most
of
his
time
up
his
tree
snoozing
or
reading
an
old
copy
of
the
new
bedford
argus
which
he
was
never
without
tonight
however
he
blazed
forth
in
full
regalia
wearing
his
best
blue
marble
his
wreathed
with
nabiscus
blossoms
his
countenance
lighted
with
conviviality
following
an
interminable
period
of
eating
and
drinking
came
a
long
speech
by
baahaabaa
which
like
most
speeches
meant
nothing
to
me
captain
triplett
replied
the
gist
of
triplett
remarks
memorized
from
the
argus
were
taken
from
the
report
of
the
new
bedford
board
of
trade
when
he
proclaimed
that
besides
cotton
goods
pianos
were
turned
out
yearly
and
derby
hats
every
day
his
audience
set
off
by
whinney
burst
into
uproarious
applause
the
climax
was
reached
when
he
lowered
his
voice
dramatically
and
said
and
keep
always
in
mind
o
baahaabaa
and
friends
that
the
new
england
fur
company
uses
daily
rabbit
pelts
gentlemen
i
thank
you
pandemonium
broke
loose
triplett
was
showered
with
congratulations
music
and
dancing
followed
among
others
an
amazing
performance
by
a
sturdy
youth
who
rendered
a
solo
by
striking
his
distended
anatomy
with
his
clenched
fist
varying
the
tone
by
relaxing
or
tightening
the
abdominal
muscles
whinney
sang
a
very
dreary
arrangement
of
mandalay
his
one
parlor
trick
swank
did
an
imitation
of
elsie
janis
imitation
of
ethel
barrymore
and
i
sang
the
wreck
of
the
julie
plante
an
amusing
ballad
describing
the
loss
by
drowning
of
an
entire
ship
company
but
the
climax
was
yet
to
come
there
was
a
vague
sort
of
commotion
among
the
banqueters
and
baahaabaa
rose
with
amazing
steadiness
and
made
another
speech
short
this
time
but
aimed
at
us
after
which
through
the
center
of
a
sort
of
formation
i
saw
approaching
four
of
the
most
exquisite
women
in
the
world
when
ten
feet
away
they
fell
on
all
fours
and
using
the
australian
crept
slowly
toward
us
exhaling
sounds
of
passionate
endearment
mingled
with
the
fragrance
of
beyond
the
glimmering
lights
an
unseen
choir
burst
into
the
of
the
national
it
was
a
critical
not
to
say
embarrassing
moment
these
lovely
ladies
were
very
evidently
presents
so
to
speak
which
we
were
expected
to
take
home
with
us
to
refuse
them
meant
certain
offense
perhaps
death
triplett
was
plainly
swank
and
whinney
were
too
far
gone
to
be
of
any
assistance
summoning
all
my
reserve
strength
i
rose
and
faced
the
whirling
assembly
gentlemen
i
said
solemnly
one
final
toast
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
at
the
same
time
draining
a
huge
shell
of
my
companions
followed
suit
and
we
fell
simultaneously
for
the
next
hours
we
were
safe
after
that
who
knew
chapter
v
a
frank
statement
we
vote
on
the
question
of
matrimony
a
triple
wedding
an
epithalmic
verse
we
remember
the
kawa
an
interview
with
william
henry
thomas
triplett
strategy
safe
within
the
atoll
in
most
volumes
on
the
south
seas
the
chapter
which
i
am
about
to
write
would
be
omitted
i
mean
to
say
that
we
have
reached
a
point
in
my
narrative
in
which
the
status
of
our
relations
with
the
filbertine
women
as
such
must
either
be
discussed
frankly
and
openly
or
treated
in
the
usual
fashion
which
seems
to
be
the
proper
thing
with
english
and
american
writers
i
have
looked
them
all
over
carefully
the
writers
i
mean
and
find
them
divided
into
two
categories
those
who
take
their
wives
along
as
a
guarantee
of
virtue
or
those
who
are
by
nature
galahads
parsifals
and
anthonys
this
latter
group
is
to
me
particularly
trying
they
revel
in
descriptions
of
desirous
damsels
with
burning
eyes
who
crave
companionship
but
when
an
artfully
devised
encounter
throws
one
of
these
passionate
persons
across
the
path
of
the
man
behind
the
pen
does
he
falter
or
swerve
or
make
a
misstep
never
right
there
is
where
the
blood
of
the
galahads
tells
supremely
he
rises
above
temptation
gracefully
he
sidesteps
innocently
he
falls
asleep
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
i
think
it
just
a
case
of
literary
men
sticking
together
two
days
after
the
grand
banquet
described
in
the
last
chapter
whinney
swank
and
i
awoke
with
a
sigh
of
simultaneous
satisfaction
completely
rested
and
restored
ten
minutes
later
we
were
engaged
in
a
brisk
debate
in
which
the
question
before
the
house
was
stated
boldly
should
we
or
should
we
not
go
native
in
other
words
should
we
hold
ourselves
aloof
live
contrary
to
the
customs
of
the
country
and
mortally
offend
our
hosts
to
say
nothing
of
our
hostesses
or
should
we
fulfil
our
destinies
take
unto
ourselves
island
brides
and
eat
our
equatorial
fruit
core
and
all
for
the
purpose
of
discussion
whinney
was
designated
to
uphold
the
negative
and
for
an
hour
we
argued
the
matter
pro
and
con
whinney
advanced
a
number
of
arguments
the
difference
in
our
nationalities
our
standing
in
our
home
communities
which
i
thought
an
especially
weak
point
our
lack
of
a
common
language
and
several
other
trivial
objections
all
of
which
swank
and
i
demolished
until
whinney
got
peevish
and
insisted
that
he
and
i
change
sides
i
spoke
very
seriously
of
the
lack
of
precedent
for
the
step
which
we
were
considering
and
of
what
my
people
in
derby
would
say
when
they
learned
that
a
traprock
had
married
a
filbert
swank
replied
with
some
heat
that
he
did
believe
that
anything
could
be
said
in
derby
that
had
been
said
already
and
whinney
was
much
more
eloquent
on
the
affirmative
than
he
had
been
on
the
negative
finally
when
i
thought
we
had
talked
enough
i
said
well
gentlemen
are
you
ready
for
a
ballot
we
are
said
swank
and
whinney
remember
i
warned
the
green
nuts
are
for
the
affirmative
the
black
ones
for
the
negative
secret
ballots
of
course
wrapping
our
votes
in
leaves
we
dropped
them
in
the
ballot
shell
whinney
was
teller
it
was
an
anxious
moment
until
he
looked
up
and
said
with
a
hysterical
quiver
in
his
voice
unanimously
green
let
go
shouted
swank
but
i
stopped
him
hold
on
i
said
triplett
is
in
on
this
we
agreed
that
it
must
be
unanimous
my
companions
faces
lengthened
like
damn
muttered
whinney
i
had
thought
of
him
you
can
imagine
our
disgust
when
we
interviewed
the
captain
not
on
your
life
he
said
decidedly
why
boys
i
got
two
a
one
in
noo
bedford
she
my
lawful
and
one
a
sort
of
in
sausalito
but
boys
i
do
go
for
to
commit
trigonometry
no
sir
thunder
rested
on
our
brows
but
the
captain
continued
but
you
you
boys
you
ai
married
leastways
if
you
are
i
know
about
it
and
if
you
ai
he
looked
at
us
severely
if
you
ai
it
high
time
you
was
and
what
more
if
you
want
to
be
i
kin
do
it
for
you
what
do
you
mean
we
gasped
justice
of
the
peace
he
said
proudly
dooly
signed
and
registered
in
dartmouth
county
mass
we
were
overwhelmed
this
was
more
than
we
dared
hope
for
more
than
we
had
even
dreamed
of
now
boys
said
the
captain
in
a
fatherly
tone
lem
me
tell
you
something
while
i
been
up
here
in
my
perch
i
been
you
boys
an
what
have
you
been

been
hell
you
have

you
ai
ketched
a
bug
nor
a
beetle

yer
and
you
ole
you
ai
drawed
a
line
have
yer
we
hung
our
heads
like
schoolboys
before
the
master
of
course
if
triplett
put
it
that
way
on
moral
grounds
so
to
speak
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
well
what
the
answer
he
continued
it
time
you
got
married
an
settled
down
ai
it
when
is
it
to
be
it
was
a
triple
wedding
the
first
and
probably
the
last
in
the
filbert
islands
and
one
of
the
most
charming
affairs
i
have
ever
seen
we
left
the
selection
of
our
brides
to
baahaabaa
and
believe
me
he
showed
himself
a
the
ceremony
took
place
on
the
beach
at
high
midnight
the
fashionable
island
hour
how
happy
we
all
were
triplett
qualifications
had
completely
cleared
the
atmosphere
of
any
moral
misgivings
which
might
have
clouded
the
beauty
of
the
gorgeous
tropical
night
the
captain
read
a
service
of
his
own
composition
full
of
legal
whereases
and
aforesaids
and
containing
one
reference
to
the
laws
of
the
commonwealth
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
which
struck
me
as
rather
but
which
under
the
circumstances
i
decided
to
let
pass
traprock
of
whom
i
can
even
now
write
only
with
deep
emotion
was
an
exquisite
creature
constructed
in
accordance
with
the
best
south
sea
specifications
in
every
particular
swank
and
whinney
were
equally
fortunate
we
would
not
have
traded
wives
for
ten
tons
of
copra
though
moolitonu
who
was
my
best
man
explained
that
this
was
perfectly
possible
in
case
we
were
not
satisfied
the
gayest
of
wedding
breakfasts
followed
at
which
all
the
ushers
behaved
in
the
orthodox
manner
after
which
we
were
conducted
to
our
individual
trees
with
appropriate
processional
and
epithalamic
chorals
the
ladies
singing
society
had
composed
for
the
occasion
a
special
ode
which
ran
as
follows
uku
kai
unio
kipiputuonaa
aaa
titi
huti
o
tefi
tapu
o
eio
hoki
ona
haasi
tui
this
was
set
to
a
slow
rhythm
a
crude
translation
of
the
words
lacking
entirely
the
onomatopoetic
quality
of
the
original
goes
something
like
this
stay
o
stay
moon
in
your
ascending
daughter
of
pearl
and
coral
to
the
moon
stay
o
stay
moon
with
light
unending
coral
pearl
and
moonlight
guard
them
from
falling
cocoanuts
i
should
stand
convicted
of
ingratitude
if
i
did
not
here
and
now
pay
tribute
to
the
sound
of
captain
triplett
at
whose
instigation
we
had
embarked
upon
this
our
great
adventure
as
triplett
had
predicted
ere
a
few
days
had
passed
we
found
awakening
within
us
the
fires
of
ambition
which
had
sunk
lower
and
lower
in
our
breasts
during
our
two
weeks
of
carousing
we
were
now
responsible
married
men
we
wanted
to
do
something
to
take
our
places
in
the
community
i
began
to
scribble
furtively
on
the
back
of
an
old
manuscript
the
book
of
an
operetta
i
had
once
written
a
musical
version
of
called
jumping
jean
in
reference
to
which
one
of
the
new
york
producers
dillingham
i
think
wrote
me
you
have
hugo
this
is
more
miserable
than
itself
i
noticed
also
that
swank
began
to
use
his
atelier
jargon
of
tonal
values
and
integrity
of
line
while
whinney
showed
up
one
morning
in
the
village
circle
with
a
splendid
blossom
of
the
pinned
to
the
center
of
his
helmet
it
was
doubtless
this
renaissance
of
mental
activity
that
reminded
us
of
the
kawa
and
of
william
henry
thomas
great
heavens
what
would
he
think
of
us
here
nearly
a
month
had
elapsed
we
were
mostly
married
and
had
never
given
him
a
thought
we
were
filled
with
compunction
on
top
of
this
triplett
came
to
us
with
the
announcement
that
baahaabaa
had
informed
him
that
we
might
expect
a
big
wind
about
this
time
remembering
what
we
had
been
through
the
captain
was
worried
about
our
tight
little
craft
he
allows
said
triplett
jerking
his
thumb
at
the
chief
that
we
orter
git
the
in
the
wet
the
question
is
where
be
she
i
explained
our
anxieties
to
ablutiluti
who
after
a
glance
at
moolitonu
diagrammatic
shoulder
blades
immediately
set
out
along
a
winding
path
to
the
shore
i
was
surprised
at
the
shortness
of
the
distance
a
walk
brought
us
to
the
beach
and
there
lay
the
kawa
as
handy
as
you
please
she
had
been
considerably
tidied
up
since
our
departure
our
had
been
stowed
and
between
the
which
were
rigged
stretched
a
rope
of
from
which
to
our
surprise
hung
an
undershirt
and
a
dainty
feminine
but
no
sign
of
william
henry
thomas
in
vain
we
shouted
kawa
ahoy
and
hurled
lumps
of
coral
all
was
mysteriously
quiet
triplett
finally
pulled
out
his
colt
and
being
a
dead
shot
drilled
the
undershirt
through
the
second
button
this
had
the
desired
effect
our
crew
almost
immediately
appeared
on
deck
and
shouted
peevishly
hey
there
quit
it
i
will
not
repeat
what
we
said
in
reply
as
this
is
a
book
for
the
home
but
it
had
a
surprising
result
is
so
yelled
william
henry
thomas
and
proceeded
to
step
jauntily
over
the
rail
and
in
our
direction
i
knew
he
swim
a
stroke
and
yet
here
he
was
performing
an
apparent
miracle
right
in
our
faces
then
it
suddenly
dawned
on
me
he
was
walking
on
the
coral
branches
it
was
not
a
particularly
pleasant
interview

readers
of
the
text
may
have
noticed
that
animal
life
plays
a
very
unimportant
part
in
the
life
of
the
filbertines
exception
must
be
made
in
the
case
of
a
magnificent
the
only
one
on
the
islands
which
was
the
proudest
possession
of
lovely
lupoba
who
later
became
the
wife
of
herman
swank
the
lives
entirely
upon
cocoanut
milk
which
gives
him
a
gentle
disposition
admirably
adapted
for
petting
swank
has
confessed
that
his
wife
fondness
for
the
creature
stirred
in
him
a
very
real
jealousy
which
in
view
of
the
charming
testimony
of
her
portrait
we
can
well
understand
a
painting
of
swank
by
her
husband
has
recently
been
purchased
by
the
corcoran
art
gallery
of
washington
after
apologizing
for
our
absence
which
we
attributed
to
illness
we
broke
the
news
as
gently
as
possible
that
we
were
married
well
said
william
henry
thomas
so
be
i
the
lady
on
board
you
old
blazed
whinney
who
married
you
she
did
he
replied
but
who
performed
the
ceremony
asked
swank
me
answered
william
henry
in
vain
we
tried
to
explain
the
necessity
of
proper
rites
his
only
rejoinder
was
you
too
late
but
what
made
our
maddest
was
the
information
that
the
yawl
had
to
be
moved
here
i
be
as
snug
as
a
bug
in
a
rug
he
stormed
an
you
go
gallivantin
round
marrying
an
what
all
an
now
you
show
up
an
boost
me
out
its
that
what
it
is
this
was
a
long
speech
for
william
henry
thomas
fortunately
it
was
his
last
while
he
was
delivering
it
i
heard
a
slight
splash
and
turned
just
in
time
to
see
a
form
slip
over
the
kawa
counter
and
disappear
i
watched
in
vain
for
her
reappearance
doubtless
like
all
filbertines
she
could
stay
under
water
for
hours
at
a
time
after
that
thomas
sullenly
did
triplett
bidding
and
assisted
in
the
work
of
getting
the
kawa
into
the
atoll
it
was
an
arduous
task
for
four
days
we
labored
working
our
vessel
close
in
shore
opposite
a
clearing
in
the
forest
where
the
outer
island
was
not
more
than
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
and
free
from
trees
instructed
by
triplett
we
paved
the
highway
to
the
lagoon
with
cocoanuts
our
wives
and
friends
thinking
it
was
a
game
assisted
us
if
they
had
known
it
was
work
they
would
of
course
have
knocked
off
immediately
and
then
the
promised
storm
broke
and
i
saw
plan
it
was
such
a
storm
as
this
undoubtedly
that
had
struck
us
on
july
this
time
crouched
in
the
shelter
of
the
trees
clinging
to
the
matted
we
were
free
to
watch
a
stupendous
spectacle
triplett
alone
went
aboard
and
lashed
himself
to
the
improvised
steering
post
our
sail
had
been
stretched
and
rigged
with
hundreds
of
yards
of
in
addition
to
which
four
large
were
lashed
along
the
scuppers
in
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
the
wind
had
risen
to
force
suddenly
let
out
a
yell
of
warning
and
pointed
seaward
rushing
toward
us
at
lightning
speed
was
a
wall
of
white
water
sixty
feet
high
in
a
trice
we
were
all
in
the
treetops
my
wife
hauling
me
after
her
with
praiseworthy
devotion
all
did
i
say
all
but
triplett
he
was
sublime
then
for
the
first
time
i
knew
that
he
was
in
truth
our
chief
waving
his
free
arm
at
the
advancing
maelstrom
he
yelled
defiance
then
this
towering
seawall
hit
him
square
in
the
stern
i
caught
one
fleeting
glimpse
of
the
kawa
gallantly
riding
the
foam
an
instant
later
she
was
flung
with
a
tremendous
crash
far
down
the
leafy
lane
fully
half
the
distance
she
must
have
gone
in
that
first
onslaught
the
last
she
ground
her
way
through
a
torrent
of
sea
and
cocoanuts
the
forest
rang
with
the
bellowing
wind
the
snapping
coral
branches
and
the
screams
of
the
fighting
vainly
against
the
current
what
a
plan
was
triplett
the
cocoanuts
being
movable
rolled
with
the
flood
and
actually
acted
as
ball
bearings
without
them
our
craft
must
certainly
have
burst
asunder
the
storm
passed
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
and
by
the
time
we
had
clambered
to
the
ground
and
rushed
across
the
atoll
there
lay
our
tight
little
darling
peacefully
at
anchor
in
the
still
waters
of
the
lagoon
with
triplett
on
her
immersed
in
the
new
bedford
argus
chapter

marital
memories

paints
a
portrait
the

and
its
curious
gift
my
adventure
with
the
saved
i
shall
never
forget
a
day
when
my
bride
and
i
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
lagoon
after
our
matinal
dip
in
its
pellucid
waters
it
was
a
perfect
september
morn
so
was
she
my
dear
i
said
suddenly
hatiaa
kappa
eppe
taue
it
sounds
like
a
college
fraternity
but
really
means
my
woodlark
what
is
your
name
i
had
been
married
over
a
week
and
i
did
not
know
my
wife
name
kippiputuonaa
she
murmured
musically
taro
ititi
aa
moieha
ephaa
lihaha
i
questioned
which
freely
translated
is
what
kippiputuonaa
then
throwing
back
her
head
with
its
superb
aureole
of
hair
she
softly
crooned
the
words
and
music
of
the
choral
which
the
community
chorus
had
sung
on
our
wedding
night
uku

one
how
it
all
came
back
to
me
leaning
towards
her
i
gently
pressed
the
lobe
of
her
ear
with
my
chin
the
native
method
of
expressing
deep
affection
her
dusky
cheeks
flushed
and
with
infinite
shyness
she
lifted
her
left
foot
and
placed
it
on
my
knee
tattooed
the
length
of
the
roseleaf
sole
in
the
graceful
ideographic
lettering
of
the
islands
i
read
kippiputuonaa
daughter
of
pearl
and
coral
what
an
exquisite
name
i
murmured
and
so
unusual
i
was
awed
i
felt
as
if
this
superb
creature
my
mate
had
revealed
to
me
the
last
the
most
hidden
of
her
secrets
i
had
heard
of
mother
of
pearl
but
of
the
daughter
never
and
i
was
married
to
her
and
you
she
whispered
are
i
liked
that
frankly
i
was
a
bit
set
up
about
it
it
sounded
so
much
better
than
i
thrust
out
my
left
foot
bare
of
any
inscription
and
she
tickled
it
playfully
with
a
blade
of
radiant
kippiputuonaa
whom
i
soon
called
kippy
for
short
your
name
shall
ever
remain
a
blessed
memory
the
deepest
and
dearest
wound
in
my
heart
kippy
proposed
that
i
should
be
marked
for
identification
in
the
usual
manner
but
i
shuddered
at
the
thought
i
was
far
too
ticklish
i
should
have
died
under
the
needle
what
days
of
joyous
romping
we
had
one
morning
a
little
crowd
of
us
just
the
swanks
whinneys
and
ourselves
met
on
the
beach
for
a
it
was
a
rare
sport
and
as
the
pillows
were
logs
of
not
without
its
element
of
danger
a
of
this
and
we
lay
bruised
and
panting
on
the
beach
listening
to
the
hoarse
bellowing
of
the
the
is
without
exception
the
most
outrageous
creature
that
ploughs
the
deep
in
fishy
guise
for
qualities
he
had
the
shark
skinned
a
nautical
mile
whinney
made
a
true
remark
to
me
one
night
one
of
the
few
he
ever
made
the
ocean
was
particularly
audible
that
evening
illustration
watchful
waiting
illustration
note
watchful
waiting
there
was
something
about
the
unfamiliar
appearance
of
yawl
the
kawa
which
filled
the
beautiful
native
women
with
a
wonder
not
unmixed
with
apprehension
this
was
particularly
true
of
the
lovely
creatures
who
married
the
three
intrepid
explorers
the
strange
object
which
had
brought
to
the
islands
these
wonderful
white
men
might
some
day
carry
them
away
again
in
view
of
the
tragic
subsequent
events
there
is
something
infinitely
pathetic
in
this
charming
where
kippiputuonaa
is
seen
anxiously
watching
the
as
she
naively
called
the
yawl
where
her
husband
traprock
is
at
work
rigging
a
new
the
kawa
unfortunately
is
just
out
of
the
picture
listen
to
that
surf
i
remarked
i
never
heard
it
grumble
like
that
before
you
grumble
if
you
were
full
of
he
said
the
has
a
mouth
like
a
subway
entrance
and
i
was
told
that
so
great
was
his
appetite
for
human
flesh
that
when
as
occasionally
happened
some
unfortunate
swimmer
had
been
eaten
by
a
shark
a
was
sure
to
come
rushing
up
and
bolt
shark
man
and
all
consequently
i
did
most
of
my
swimming
in
the
lagoon
speaking
of
the
lagoon
reminds
me
of
an
absurd
bit
of
information
i
picked
up
from
kippy
that
made
me
feel
as
flat
as
a
pressed
fern
we
were
wandering
along
the
shore
one
morning
and
she
suddenly
pointed
to
the
kawa
and
said
laughingly
why
triplett
bring
over
cocoanuts
why
not
swim
she
asked
look
see
big
hole
i
looked
and
saw
a
whole
section
of
the
atoll
near
where
we
were
standing
was
movable
kippy
jumped
up
and
down
on
it
and
it
rocked
like
a
raft
at
the
edges
i
saw
that
it
was
lashed
to
the
trees
with
vines
cheap
you
could
have
bought
me
for
a
bad
clam
as
i
thought
of
the
days
we
had
sweated
over
those
damned
cocoanuts
of
peril
of
the
danger
to
the
yawl
while
our
very
families
looked
on
and
laughed
thinking
it
was
a
game
and
we
might
have
slipped
out
the
movable
and
simply
eased
through
well
for
the
first
time
in
my
married
life
i
was
mad
kippy
was
all
tenderness
in
an
instant
no
rain
she
begged
daughter
of
pearl
and
coral
eat
clouds
she
chinned
my
ear
passionately
and
i
was
disarmed
in
an
instant
i
hated
to
tell
triplett
it
seemed
to
dim
his
glory
but
i
have
worried
good
business
he
exclaimed
we
can
get
her
out
inter
the
open
have
some
sailin
parties
i
like
to
catch
one
of
them
that
was
the
sort
triplett
was
he
done
his
trick
and
there
was
an
end
of
it
the
next
day
he
had
william
henry
thomas
busy
the
kawa
william
henry
thomas
by
the
way
insisted
on
living
on
board
in
happy
but
unholy
wedlock
and
whinney
swank
and
i
felt
that
it
was
better
so
somehow
we
considered
him
the
village
scandal
during
these
peaceful
days
i
wrote
a
great
deal
posting
up
my
diary
as
far
as
we
had
gone
and
jotting
down
a
lot
of
valuable
material
swank
had
got
his
impediments
off
the
boat
and
began
daubing
furiously
landscapes
seascapes
monotypes
ideographs
everything
most
of
them
were
hideously
funny
but
he
did
one
thing
inspired
by
love
i
suppose
a
portrait
of
his
wife
that
was
a
hummer
she
was
a
lovely
little
thing
with
a
lovely
name
swank
i
said
that
a
the
mountain
is
a
little
out
of

whinney
was

he
took
them
all
on

to
that
he
said
to
me
one
night
as
we
were
strolling
back
from
a
friendly
game
of
with
baahaabaa
and
some
of
our
friends
i
listened
it
was
the
most
unearthly
and
at
the
same
time
the
most
beautiful
i
have
ever
heard
what
is
it
i
asked
as
the
cry
resounded
again
a
piercing
screech
of
pain
ending
in
a
long
yowl
of
joy
it
is
the
motherhood
cry
of
the
he
said
she
has
just
laid
an
egg
but
why
the
note
of
suffering
i
queried
the
eggs
of
the
are
square
said
whinney
and
i
was
silenced
motherhood
is
indeed
the
great
mystery
little
did
i
realize
that
night
how
much
i
was
to
owe
to
the
and
her
strange
maternal
gift
which
saved
my
life
in
one
of
the
weirdest
adventures
that
has
ever
befallen
mortal
man
it
was
a
placid
day
on
the
sea
and
kippy
and
i
were
returning
from
a
swim
to
a
neighboring
island
whither
i
had
been
taken
to
be
shown
off
to
some
relatives
i
had
said
when
she
first
proposed
the
expedition
but
she
had
laughed
gaily
and
nodded
her
head
to
indicate
that
there
was
not
the
slightest
danger
and
shamed
into
it
we
had
set
forth
and
made
an
excellent
crossing
on
the
return
trip
midway
between
the
two
islands
i
was
floating
lazily
supported
by
a
girdle
of
inflated
bladders
and
towed
by
kippy
she
had
propped
over
my
head
her
verdant
without
which
the
natives
never
swim
for
fear
of
the
tropical
sun
and
i
think
i
must
have
dozed
off
for
i
was
suddenly
roused
by
a
hoarse
which
told
me
all
too
plainly
that
i
was
in
the
most
hideous
peril
i
barked
and
all
my
past
life
began
to
unfold
before
me
it
was
a
horrid
sight
the
i
mean
he
was
swimming
on
the
surface
and
at
ten
feet
i
saw
his
great
jaws
open
lined
with
row
upon
row
of
teeth
that
stretched
back
into
his
interior
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
and
farther
mixed
up
with
this
dreadful
reality
were
visions
of
my
past
i
seemed
to
be
peering
into
one
of
those
vast
empty
auditoriums
that
had
greeted
my
opera
jumping
jean
when
it
was
finally
produced
privately
help
help
i
screamed
reverting
to
english
suddenly
kippy
seized
the
from
my
nerveless
grasp
half
closing
it
she
swam
directly
toward
the
monster
into
whose
widening
throat
she
thrust
the
instrument
in
in
until
i
thought
she
herself
would
follow
it
and
then
as
she
had
intended
the
point
pierced
the
tonsil
with
a
shriek
of
pain
his
jaws
began
to
close
and
on
the
instant
kippy
yanked
the
handle
with
all
her
might
opening
the
to
its
full
extent
in
the
beast
very
narrows
choked
though
he
was
unable
for
the
moment
to
bite
or
expel
the
outer
air
and
submerge
the
brute
was
still
dangerous
kippy
was
towing
me
shoreward
at
a
speed
which
caused
the
sea
to
foam
about
my
bladders
but
the
still
pursued
us
a
second
time
my
dauntless
mate
rose
to
the
occasion
with
amazing
buoyancy
she
lifted
herself
to
a
position
on
the
surface
of
the
water
and
poured
forth
the
most
astounding
imitation
of
the
motherhood
cry
of
the
again
and
yet
again
it
rang
across
the
waters
and
in
the
distance
flying
at
incredible
speed
i
saw
the
rainbow
host
of
coming
towards
us
gallant
fowl
shall
i
ever
forget
how
they
circled
about
us
one
of
their
clan
as
they
supposed
was
in
dire
danger
and
they
functioned
as
only
a
can
flying
at
an
immense
height
in
battle
formation
they
began
laying
eggs
with
marvelous
precision
the
first
two
struck
the
square
on
the
nose
and
he
screamed
with
pain
the
third
landing
put
out
his
right
eye
and
he
began
to
thrash
in
helpless
circles
the
fourth
was
a
direct
hit
on
my
left
temple
passed
over
the
horizon
into
oblivion
whence
he
emerged
to
find
himself
in
a
tree
his
brow
eased
with
an
poultice
his
heart
comforted

i
can
truthfully
say
that
they
were
the
happiest
of
my
existence
the
of
our
island
domesticity
was
a
charm
against
tedium
our
family
reunions
were
joys
often
we
organized
picnics
to
distant
points
with
of
leaves
packed
with
a
supply
of
breadfruit

and
a

would

of

lovely
retreats
with
which
our

were
familiar
occasionally
we
sailed
in
the
kawa
at
which
times
the
intrepid
triplett
accompanied
us
remembering
those
happy
times
i
now
realize
that
his
presence
cast
the
only
shadow
across
the
bright
sunlight
of
our
days
why
this
was
i
could
not
have
said
indeed
i
should
have
probably
denied
that
it
was
so
yet
the
fact
remains
that
on
some
of
our
excursions
to
neighboring
islands
when
having
pulled
back
the
terrestrial
cork
of
the
atoll
we
had
eased
our
tight
little
craft
into
the
outer
waters
i
experienced
a
distinct
dorsal
chill
both
kippiputuonaa
and
felt
this
to
a
marked
degree
but
most
of
all
was
it
apparent
in
its

worked
william
henry

to
exhaustion
rerigging
the

and
then
thrust
him
out

and
baggage
but
i
must
admit
that
between
them
they
had
done
a
good
job
william
henry
and
his
bride
took
up
lodgings
in
a
tall
tree
near
the
lagoon
whence
they
used
mournfully
to
regard
the
floating
home
in
which
they
had
spent
their
unhallowed
honeymoon
when
we
actually
began
to
sail
her
the
william
henry
thomases
disappeared
from
view
as
if
the
sight
were
too
much
for
them
and
we
seldom
saw
them
thereafter
triplett
ingenuity
was
responsible
for
the
bamboo

woven

and
the
new
which
in
the
absence
of
a
universal
joint
was
cleverly
fashioned
of
braided
on
our
cruises
our
wives
spent
a
large
part
of
their
time
overboard
sporting
about
the
ship
like
porpoises
ever
and
anon
diving
deep
under
our
counter
only
to
appear
on
the
other
side
decked
with
polyp
buds
as
if
crowned
by
neptune

at
this
game

never
shall
i
forget
the
day
she
suddenly
popped
up
close
alongside
and
playfully
tossed
a
magnificent
pearl
into
triplett
lap
but
as
i
say
i
did
not
feel
at
ease
perhaps
it
was
my
experience
with
the
perhaps
however
i
anticipate
our
merriest
jaunts
were
nearer

most
memorable
of
all
was
our
first
trip
to
the
mountain
that
gorgeous
pile
on
the
center
of
the
lagoon
it
was
early
morning
when
we
set
out
disdaining
our
trim
from
the
deck
of
which
triplett
watched
our
short
swim
across
the
still
water
at
every
stroke
flocks
of
iridescent
rose
about
us
uttering
their
brittle
note

one
of
the
pleasantest
sights
imaginable
is
that
of
the
natives
gathering

was
the
sort

thing
that
greeted
the
intrepid
explorers
of

they
made
their
first
tour
of
the
island
and
were
entertained
by
the
entrancing
inhabitants
of
the
women

and
it
was
only
after
much
persuasion
that
they
agreed
to
be
photographed
but
when
finally
posed
to
whinney
satisfaction
they
entered
into
the
spirit
of
the
occasion
by
bursting
into
the
national
anthem
of
love
which
is
described
in
chapter
ii
the
instruments
are
the
bombi
a
hollow
section
of
covered
with
fish
membrane
and
the
lonkila
a
stringed
instrument
of
most
plaintive
and
persuasive
tone
these
two
instruments
with
the
addition
of
the
bazoota
a
affair
made
from
papoo
reeds
make
up
the
simple
orchestral
equipment
of
the
filberts
we
were
all
wearing
the
native
costume
and
swank
i
remember
caught
his
on
a
coral
branch
and
delayed
us
five
minutes
but
we
were
soon
on
the
inner
beach
laughing
over
the
incident
while
babai
made
repairs
the
path
up
the
mountain
led
through
a
paradise
of
tropical
wonders
on
this
trip
whinney
was
easily
the
star
his
scientific
knowledge
enabling
him
to
point
out
countless
marvels
which
we
might
not
otherwise
have
seen
as
he
talked
i
made
rapid
notes
look
he
said
holding
up
an
exquisite
reptile
the
or
pink
garter
snake
almost
unheard
of
in
the
tropics
kippy
insisted
on
tying
it
around
her
shapely
limb
then
of
course
babai
must
have
one
too
and
great
were
our
exertions
before
we
bagged
an
additional
pair
for
our
loved
ones
thus
sporting
on
our
way
crowned
with
and
girdled
with
a
gorgeous
type
of
snapdragon
which
kept
all
manner
of
insects
at
bay
we
wound
toward
the
summit
stopping
ever
and
anon
to
admire
the
cliffs
of
sheer
pages
of
colorful
history
thrown
up
long
ago
by
some
primeval
illness
of
mother
earth
swank
was
so
intoxicated
by
it
all
that
i
made
almost
the
only
break
of
our
island
experience
you
been
drinking
i
accused
you

he
answered
hotly
it
these

oh
shut
up
i
remonstrated
when
i
saw
tilaana
advancing
toward
me
fluttering
her
in
the
same
menacing
way
in
which
kippy
had
attacked
the
i
beg
your
pardon
i
said
i
was
wrong
i
apologize
we
stood
in
a
circle
and
chinned
each
other
until
peace
was
restored
the
view
from
the
summit
was
as
authors
say
indescribable
nevertheless
i
shall
describe
it
or
rather
i
shall
quote
whinney
who
at
this
moment
reached
his
highest
point
we
were
then
about
three
thousand
feet
above
i
wish
i
could
give
his
address
as
it
was
delivered
in
filbertese
but
i
fear
that
my
readers
would
skip
a
form
of
literary
exercise
which
i
detest
try
for
a
moment
to
hold
the
picture
our
little
group
standing
on
the
very
crest
of
the
mountain
as
if
about
to
sing
the
final
chorus
of
the
creation
to
an
audience
of
islands
they
stretched
these
jeweled
confections
while
below
almost
at
our
very
feet
we
could
see
the
kawa
and
triplett
a
tiny
speck
frantically
waving
his
even
at
three
thousand
feet
he
gave
me
a
chill
but
let
whinney
speak
it
is
plain
he
said
that
the
basalt
monadnock
on
which
we
stand
is
a
carboniferous
upthrust
of
metamorphosed
schists
shales
and
conglomerate
probably
mesozoic
or
at
least
early
silurian
at
this
point
our
wives
burst
into
laughter
in
fact
their
attitude
throughout
was
trying
but
whinney
bravely
proceeded
you
doubtless
noticed
on
the
shore
that
the
metamorphic
crystals
have
been
exposed
by
erosion
leaving
on
the
upper
levels
faulted
strata
of
tilted
interstratified
with

have
shouted

continued

the

simply
an

terminal

alluvially
into

leaving
a

if
any
one
entered
so
fully
into
the
spirit

the
silent

him
wearing

having
discarded

every
day
he
discarded
some
article

who

took
unto
himself
an

it
was
he
who
ultimately
abandoned
all

of

close

the

of
the

the

you
must
admit
that
for
an
indescribable
thing
it
is
a
very
fine
description
after
several
days
of
idyllic
life
in
our
mountain

we
felt
the
returning

were

anything
we
proposed
was
agreeable
to
them
as
we
trooped
down
the
mountain
singing
our
merry
chorus
shook
the
forest

and
literally
brought
down
the
cocoanuts
whinney
was
not
alone
in
his
scientific
discoveries
for
on
the
return
trip
babai
suddenly
gave
a
cry
of
delight
and
the
next
instant
had
climbed
with
amazing
agility
to
the
top
of
a
towering
palm
whence
she
returned
bearing
a
bowl
of
closely
woven
grass
in
which
lay
four
cubes
the
marvelous
square
eggs
of
the
kopaa
kopitaa
aue
she
cried
hide
them
quickly
away
i
knew
the
danger
of
which
my
temple
still
bore
the
scar
concealing
our
find
under
our
we
scraped
and
slid
over
the
faulted
and
tilted
strata
to
which
whinney
had
referred
until
we
reached
the
beach
high
above
us
i
could
hear
the
anguished
cry
of
the
mother
vainly
seeking
her
ravished
home
and
potential
family
the
marking
of
the
eggs
is
most
curious
and
whinney
took
a
photograph
of
them
see

the
nest
of

when
we
reached
the

it
is
an
excellent
picture
though
whinney
with
the
raptiousness
of
the
scientist
claims
that
one
of
the
eggs
moved
just
before
we
left
the
mountain
beach
my
own
radiant
daughter
of
pearl
and

made
a
discovery
which
in
the
light
of
after
events
was
destined
to
play
an
important
part
in
our
adventures
kippiputuona
my
own
true
mate
there
is
something
ironically
tragic
in
the
thought
that
the
simple
blue
flower
which
you
plucked
so
carelessly
from
the
cliff
edge
and
thrust
into
your
hair
would
some
day
but
again
i
anticipate
we
had
reached
the
yawl
which
we
made
a
sort
of
house
and
were
chatting
with
captain
triplett
whinney
was
repeating
parts
of
his
talk
and
i
noticed
that
triplett
attention
was
wandering
his
eye
was
firmly
fixed
on
the
flower
in
kippy
hair
that
called
my
attention
to
it
and
i
saw
that
whenever
my
wife
turned
her
head
the
blossom
of
the
flower
slowly
turned
in
the
opposite
direction
suddenly
triplett
interrupted
whinney
to
say
in
a
rather
shaky
voice
traprock
if
you
please
would
you
mind
facin
i
motioned
to
kippy
to
obey
which
she
would
have
done
anyway
an
now
said
the
captain
kindly
face
forrard
same
business
the
flower
slowly
turned
on
kippy
head
stretching
forth
a
trembling
hand
triplett
plucked
the
blossom
from
kippy
hair
you
can
only
imagine
the
commotion
which
ensued
when
i
tell
you
that
in
the
filberts
for
a
man
to
pluck
a
flower
from
a
woman
hair
means
only
one
thing
poor
kippy
was
torn
between
love
of
me
and
what
she
thought
was
duty
to
my
chief
i
had
a
most
difficult
time
explaining
to

meant
absolutely
nothing
by
his

statement
which
he
corroborated
by
all
sorts
of
absurd

gestures
but
he
clung
to
the
flower
an
hour
later
when
we
had
escorted
the
ladies
safely
to
their
compound

paddled
back
to
the

deplorable
condition
an

of
the
archipelago
on

the
judgment
whinney
and
i
were
surprised
to
find
that
the
islanders
took
swank
more
seriously
than
they
did
either
of
us
of
course
since
the
forcible
entry
into
the
atoll
premier
honors
were
triplett
but
swank
was
easily
second
the
curious
reason
was
that
his
pictures
appealed
i
think
i
have
indicated
that
swank
was
ultramodern
in
his
tendencies
artless
art
was
his
formula
often
expressed
by
his
slogan
a
bas
vive
le
subjonctif
whatever
that
means
he
scored
with
the
filbertines
who
would
gather
in
immense
numbers
wherever
he
set
up
his
easel
this
was
due
in
part
to
his
habit
of
standing
with
his
back
to
the
scene
which
he
proposed
to
paint
and
bending
over
until
his
head
almost
touched
the
ground
peering
at
the
landscape
between
his
outspread
legs
it
intensifies
the
color
he
explained
try
it
baahaabaa
bestowed
a
title
on
our
artist
maimaue
ahiiahi
tattooer
of
rainbows
by
which
he
was
loudly
acclaimed
whinney
and
i
used
to
sing
he
always
tattooing
rainbows
but
artistic
vanity
was
proof
against
such
baahaabaa
was
tireless
in
suggesting
new
subjects
for
him
to
paint
one
day
it
would
be
a
performance
of
the
the
languorously
sensuous
dance
which
we
had
first
seen
in
the
women
compound
again
he
would
stage
a
scene
of
feasting
at
which
the
men
passed
foaming
shells
of
from
hand
to
hand
a
difficulty
was
that
of
preventing
the
artist
from
quitting
work
and
joining
his
models
which
swank
always
justified
by
saying
that
the
greatest
art
resulted
from
submerging
oneself
with
one
subject
look
at
gaugin
he
used
to
say
but
i
do
like
to
look
at
gaugin
i
remonstrated
whinney
foolishly
tried
to
compete
with
swank
by
means
of
his
camera
foolishly
i
say
though
the
result
was
one
of
the
finest
spectacles
i
have
ever
witnessed
for
days
whinney
had
been
stalking
swank
photographing
everything
he
painted
in
a
darkroom
of
closely
woven
leaves
the
films
were
developed
and
a
proof
rushed
off
to
baahaabaa
long
before
the
artist
had
finished
his
picture
this
naturally
irritated
swank
and
he
finally
challenged
the
scientist
to
mortal
combat
an
artistic
duel
camera
against
brush
lens
against
eye
when
the
details
were
explained
to
baahaabaa
he
was
in
a
frenzy
of
excitement
as
judge
his
decision
was
to
be
final
which
should
have
warned
whinney
who
as
the
challenged
party
had
the
right
to
select
the
subject
his
choice
was
distinctly
artful
i
think
i
got
him
he
confided
we

you
know

that
means

it
is
rare
indeed
to
find
a
beach
in
the
filbert
islands
so
deserted
an
hour
after
this

was

more
than
three

were

when
the
rivals
showed
up
on
the
beach
at
the
appointed
time
i
regret
to
say
that
swank
was
not
himself
he
had
spent
the
night
with
baahaabaa
and
who
supported
him
on
either
side
and
balanced
him
precariously
on
his
where
he
promptly
fell
asleep
in
the
meantime
whinney
was
dodging
about
with
his
camera
squinting
in
the
finder
without
finding
anything
one
never
does
peering
at
the
brightening
sky
holding
his
thumb
at

length

the

gesture
used
to
signify
contempt
and
derision
in
a
word
going
through
all
the
artistic
motions
which
should
have
been
swank
the
latter
finally
aroused
himself
and
laboriously
got
onto
all
fours
looking
like
a
dromedary
about
to
lie
down
from
which
position
he
contemplated
the
sunrise
for
several
minutes
and
then
began
to

his

whinney

industriously
he
had
decided
to
use
an
entire

and
submit
the
picture
which
came
out
best
swank
was
gradually
covering
his
canvas
by
squeezing
the
paint
directly
from
the
tubes
a
method
which
has
since
been
copied
by
many
others
the
tubistes
so
called
every
few
moments
he
would
lurch
forward
and
press
his
nose
against
the
canvas
once
falling
flat
on
his
masterpiece
most
of
which
was
transferred
to
his
chest
but
he
persevered
whinney
by
this
time
had
retired
to
his
darkroom
baahaabaa
and
snored
swank
worked
and
i
from
a
knoll
watched
the
miracle
of
a
tropical
dawn
it
was
a
scene
of
infinite
calm
low
in
peaceful
in
composition
the
curve
of
purple
and
lavender
beach
unbroken
the
crest
of
dark
palms
unmoved
like
a
turk
verse
along
a
scimitar
the
waters
of
the
lagoon
a
mirror
of
molten
amber
reflected
the
soft
hues
of
the
sky
from
which
the
trailing
garments
of
night
were
gradually
withdrawn
before
his
majesty
the
day
swank
only
allowed
himself
the
use
of
the
three
primary
colors
consequently
his
rendering
of
the
opalescent
beauty
of
this
particular
dawn
was
somewhat
beyond
me
where
i
saw
the
glowing
promise
of
color
rather
than
color
itself
swank
saw
red
where
i
felt
the
hushed
presence
of
dawn
like
a
pilgrim
clad
swank
vibrated
to
the
harmonies
of
pure
pigment
the
full
brass
of
a
tonal
orchestra
of
a
sudden
his
color
hypnotism
transported
him
eee

he
howled
brandishing
a
handful
of
naples
yellow
mixed
with
coral
which
he
hurled
at
the
canvas
zow

his
shrieks
roused
his
escorts
and
brought
a
rapidly
swelling
crowd
to
the
dune
where
to
the
sound
of
his
own
ravings
and
the
plaudits
of
the
spectators
he
finished
his
masterpiece
late
afternoon
of
the
same
day
was
the
hour
agreed
upon
for
the
judgment
baahaabaa
had
sent
invitations
by
express
swimmers
to
all
the
islands

invited

yet
how
differently
they
reacted
to
it
in
the
beauty
of
nature
about
him
it
is
evident
that
the
great

felt
only
the
dominant
feature
of

the
glorious
untrammeled
womanhood
of

i
swam
to
the

where
the

were
sporting
among
the

diving
for
pearls
which
rolled
on
the
purple
floor
as
i
think
now
of
the
value
of
those

over
the

is
built
like

the
sound

singing
summoned
us
the
judgment

about
to
take
place
at

we
swam
ashore
and
joined
the
crowd
for
once
i
was
glad
that

had
no

that

the

conferred

the
added
distinction

really
meaning

baahaabaa
spoke
first
in

i
think
i
may
say
that
he
spoke
first
last
and
all
the
time
i
can
conscientiously
claim
that
he
is
the
champion
orator
of
the
world
ever
and
anon
he
gave
way
to
a
guest
but
only
for
a
moment
we
are
met
he
said
i
translate
freely
we
are

the

could
anything
be

delicate

to
rise

kiss
his
toward
the
audience

immediately
put
him
on
a
friendly
footing
after
a
few
more
speeches
by
baahaabaa
the
exhibits
were
unveiled
of
course
the
result
was
foregone
i
must
admit
that
whinney
was
not
hung
to
advantage
the
two
pictures
were
placed
against
tufts
of
at
forty
yards
distance
where
naturally
the
detail
of
the
photograph
lost
something
of
its
effectiveness
swank

on
the
contrary
blazed
like
a
the
further
you
got
from
it
the
better
it
looked
a
characteristic
point
in
the
competition
was
that
swank
had
introduced
figures
into
his
composition
where
no
figures
had
existed
what
do
i
care
he
said
to
my
objection
i
was
there

i
and
you
were
there
there
may
have
been
others
a
mighty
roar
followed
the
unveiling
a
shout
of
such
force
that
tons
of
breadfruit
and
thousands
of
cocoanuts
fell
from
the
adjacent
trees
but
it
was
plain
to
see
whom
the
shouting
was
for
then
baahaabaa
made
the
awards
and
the
prizes
were
identical

of
elaborately
trimmed
with
corals
and

what
tact
what
grace
and
charm
in
these
identical
rewards
i
am
fortunate
in
being
able
to
reproduce
both
masterpieces
so
that
my
readers
may
form
their

to
me
to

i
may
be

will
probably
back
up
the

whom
he
roused
as
he
had
us
katia
we
repeated
hoko
he
answered
and
to
our
surprise
again
motioned
us
forward
for
twenty
minutes
we
threaded
a
forest
trail
in
which
still
lurked
the
shadows
of
night
at
a
giant
palm
tree
our
leader
again
tapped
gently
who
should
look
over
the
edge
of
the
densely
screened
dwelling
but
william
henry
thomas
at
first
glimpse
of
us
he
hastily
drew
back
and
i
heard
the
muttered
sound
of
new
england
cursing
reassured
by
baahaabaa
however
he
slid
down
to
join
us
followed
by
his
wife
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
really
seen
her
and
i
must
say
that
i
was
completely
bowled
over
by
the
sight
plainly
not
of
the
same
social
class
as
the
beautiful
women
whom
baahaabaa
had
selected
for
us
she
yet
possessed
an
eerie
charm
of
her
own
which
instantly
stirred
strange
emotions
in
my
breast
i
heard
swank
gasp
and
whinney
face
was
white
and
drawn
his
favorite
expression
when
deeply
moved
she
stood
close
to
her
husband
about
him
with
the
grace
and
strength
of
an
vine
while
her
kindling
eyes
burned
questioningly
her
lithe
body
tense
and
protective
he
is
to
be
christened
said
baahaabaa
with
a
magnificent
gesture
toward
william
henry
thomas
we
could
only
look
our
astonishment
yes
continued
the
chief
smiling
benignly
first
among
you
all
is
he
to
have
his
name
recorded
in
our
ancient
fashion
as
he
pronounced
these
words
baahaabaa
lifted
his
left
foot
solemnly
and
pointed
to
his
own
royal
appellation
tattooed
on
the
sole
our
wives
did
likewise
what
is
his
name
whinney
asked
william
henry
thomas
head
rose
proudly
as
his
wife
replied
in
thrilling
woodland
tones
fatakahala
fatakahala
repeated
baahaabaa
flower
of
darkness
and
william
henry
thomas
raised
his
head
as
high
as
it
would
go
when
does
the
ceremony
take
place
asked
whinney
baahaabaa
pointed
to
the
distant
peak
of
the
mountain
tonight
maka
the
tattooer
is
ready
the
fishbones
are
sharpened
the
juice
of
the
fills
the
holy
shell
we
go
all
that
day
we
strung
ceremonial
garlands
about
the
base
of
the
mountain
which
with
its
circumference
of
a
mile
and
was
no
small
task
but
sunset
found
it
completed
we
supped
on
the
beach
and
at
nine
under
a
rising
moon
climbed
toward
the
summit
the
peak
was
reserved
for
william
henry
thomas
maka
and
her
four
attendants
who
bore
the
utensils
and
long
ropes
of
to
tie
him
with
whispered
baahaabaa
illustration
the
nest
of
a
illustration
note
the
nest
of
a
this
is
without
question
the
most
extraordinary
picture
which
has
ever
been
taken
of
any
natural
history
subject
it
corroborates
in
most
convincing
manner
the
author
claim
to
the
discovery
of
the
wonderful
bird
with
its
unique
gift
of
laying
square
eggs
here
we
see
the
eggs
themselves
in
all
the
beauty
of
their
cubical
form
and
quaint
marking
here
we
see
the
nest
itself
made
of
delicately
woven
haro
and
brought
carefully
from
the
tree
summit
by
its
discoverer
an
extremely
interesting
feature
of
the
picture
is
the
presence
in
the
nest
of
lapa
or
by
close
observation
whinney
the
scientist
of
the
expedition
discovered
that
whenever
the
left
the
nest
in
search
of
food
she
always
decorated
her
home
with
one
of
her
wing
feathers
which
served
as
a
signal
to
her
mate
that
she
would
return
shortly
which
she
invariably
did
skeptics
have
said
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
lay
a
square
egg
to
which
the
author
is
justly
entitled
to
say
the
camera
never
lies
at
exactly
ten
by
the
shadow
of
the
mountain
on
the
atoll
william
henry
thomas
stepped
forth
into
the
moonlight
to
face
his
ordeal
alone
in
the
darkness
we
waited
kippy
clinging
close
to
me
then
came
a
sound
at
which
i
could
but
shudder
it
was
a
giggle
the
voice
plainly
that
of
william
henry
thomas
this
was
followed
by
a
hysterical
sob
of
laughter
the
christening
has
begun
murmured
kippy
you
can
not
imagine
anything
more
horrible
before
to
my
knowledge
had
william
henry
thomas
laughed
now
wilder
and
yet
more
wild
rang
his
uncontrollable
mirth
rising
at
times
to
demoniac
screams
anon
sinking
to
convulsive
chuckles
the
worst
of
it
was
that
it
was
infectious
conscious
though
we
were
of
the
poor
wretch
suffering
we
could
not
help
joining
his
vocal
expression
of
it
and
thus
we
sat
in
the
darkness
our
peals
of
laughter
bursting
forth
at
every
fresh
paroxysm
tears
of
distress
rolled
down
swank
cheeks
an
hour
later
the
vines
parted
and
a
recumbent
form
was
borne
gently
down
the
mountain
william
henry
thomas
that
was
his
new
name
wrapped
in
soft
leaves
over
which
his
wife
sobbed
in
tender
ecstasy
on
the
day
following
a
bolt
fell
from
the
blue
swank
and
i
were
spending
the
afternoon
with
triplett
on
board
the
kawa
where
the
captain
was
explaining
the
workings
of
various
navigating
instruments
which
he
had
manufactured
this
here
is
a
astrolabe
he
said
jackass
quadrant
i
call
it
he
displayed
a
sort
of
rudimentary
crossbow
an
this
here
is
a
kind
of
a
telescope
see
bamboo
the
lenses
ai
very
good
had
to
use
got
my
nicely
rooted
in
sand
see
she
doin
fine
what
this
all
for
asked
swank
triplett
smiled
malevolently
do
you
want
to
know
where
you
be
i
got
it
all
figgered
out
got
a
chart
too
he
unrolled
a
broad
leaf
on
which
he
had
drawn
a
rough
sketch
of
the
island
probable
north
and
possible
latitude
and
longitude
again
the
chill
of
dismay
and
apprehension
which
i
had
felt
before
in
triplett
presence
ran
up
and
down
my
spine
it
was
beginning
to
dawn
upon
me
that
triplett
was
planning
a
my
god
i
cried
take
that
thing
away
what
you
trying
to
do
triplett
hook
us
up
to
civilization
with
all
its
deviltry
and
disease
and
damned
conventions
do
you
appreciate
the
beauty
of
getting
outside
of
the
covers
of
a
geography
the
old
devil
only
grinned
his
very
leer
seeming
to
say
i
got
a
trump
card
up
my
sleeve
young
man
what
might
have
been
a
bitter
scene
was
interrupted
by
something
much
more
serious
we
saw
whinney
running
along
the
edge
of
the
lagoon
into
which
he
presently
plunged
and
began
swimming
madly
in
our
direction
as
he
drew
near
i
saw
that
he
was
deathly
white
when
we
dragged
him
over
the
rail
he
collapsed
in
the
scuppers
and
burst
into
tears
what
is
it
we
questioned
he
jerked
out
his
answer
in
hoarse
broken
fragments
while
our
blood
froze
it
come
i
was
afraid
of
it
from
the
first
it
here
we
done
it
we
got
to
get
out
it
is
not
fair
for
heaven
sake
i
shouted
what
here
what
have
we
done
disease
he
panted
disease
you
know
how
the
other
islands
marquesas
solomons
tongas
dying
all
dying
his
voice
sank
and
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
shoulders
shaking
what
what
is
it
who
has
it
it
was
then
that
whinney
made
the
supreme
call
on
his
nerve
stiffened
visibly
and
answered
in
a
dead
voice
my
wife
has
it
seemed
to
me
in
that
moment
that
the
entire
atoll
revolved
rapidly
in
one
direction
while
the
mountain
twirled
in
the
other
through
my
brain
crashed
a
sequence
of
sickening
pictures
the
lepers
of
molokai
with
their
hideous
affliction
imported
from
china
the
gaunt
coughing
wrecks
of
papeete
the
scarecrows
of
samoa
and
now
this
and
whinney
was
right
had
done
it
who
individually
i
know
not
nor
cared
but
collectively
we
were
guilty
into
this
eden
this
paradise
in
which
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
the
slightest
ailment
we
the
prideful
whites
had
brought
this
deadly
thing
should
we
remain
i
dared
not
face
the
consequences
is
it
bad
i
managed
to
ask
pretty
moaned
poor
whinney
left
knee
small
of
back
spreading
i
going
home
i
said
we
meet
here
tomorrow
afternoon
at
the
same
tune
if
this
thing
develops
i
finished
my
sentence
by
diving
overboard
early
next
morning
i
knew
the
worst
daughter
of
pearl
and
coral
was
restless
during
the
night
when
the
sun
rose
a
single
glance
at
her
polished
shoulders
and
my
heart
broke
never
to
be
repaired
folding
her
gently
in
my
arms
i
trembled
in
a
paroxysm
of
grief
we
spent
the
entire
day
together
i
in
an
agony
of
soul
which
i
could
not
quite
conceal
and
which
my
beloved
tried
to
dispel
by
the
tenderest
tributes
of
her
consuming
love
i
can
not
speak
more
of
what
lies
too
deeply
in
my
heart
illustration
a
fledgling
illustration
note
a
fledgling
it
was
by
the
rarest
good
fortune
that
traprock
was
able
to
secure
what
is
probably
the
only
living
specimen
now
in
captivity
of
the
hitherto
unknown
bird
immediately
upon
his
arrival
at
papeete
efforts
were
made
to
secure
a
mother
bird
of
any
kind
which
would
hatch
out
the
four
eggs
then
in
the
explorer
possession
owing
to
their
angular
and
uncomfortable
shape
it
was
found
impossible
to
keep
a
bird
brooding
for
more
than
three
minutes
at
a
time
after
much
effort
one
egg
was
finally
hatched
from
which
was
derived
the
handsome
specimen
shown
in
the
illustration
the
youngster
is
now
doing
finely
in
the
bronx
aviary
unfortunately
he
is
a
male
so
that
his
hope
of
posterity
rests
entirely
upon
the
success
of
another
expedition
to
the
filbert
islands
it
was
a
tragic
trio
which
reassembled
on
the
kawa
deck
as
the
late
afternoon
sun
spread
its
golden
hand
across
the
lagoon
the
purple
shadow
of
the
mountain
rested
on
our
tiny
craft
but
a
shadow
yet
deeper
shrouded
our
hearts
each
of
us
carried
the
consciousness
of
a
terrible
duty
we
ought
to
leave
the
filberts
we
talked
over
the
situation
getting
worse
was
whinney
report
saw
baahaabaa
scratching
his
leg
this
morning
probably
got
it
poor
baahaabaa
how
my
heart
ached
for
him
we
ought
to
leave
i
said
it
was
the
first
time
any
of
us
had
dared
state
the
hideous
truth
in
plain
words
they
fell
like
lead
on
our
spirits
swank
sensitive
soul
was
perhaps
the
most
harrowed
of
all
he
sat
moaning
on
the
taffrail
taking
little
or
no
part
in
the
discussion
all
at
once
he
sprang
up
with
blazing
eyes
i
ca
do
it
he
shouted
i
ca
and
i
wo
blessed
little
lupoba
my
how
can
i
desert
you
how
can
we
any
of
us
desert
our
wives
let
us
stay
let
us
live
and
if
we
must
let
us
die
love
is
more
than
life
it
was
a
powerful
appeal
overwrought
as
i
was
i
nearly
succumbed
to
the
false
reasoning
which
was
but
the
expression
of
my
desire
and
then
once
more
the
vision
of
those
deadly
inroads
of
disease
rose
before
me
whinney
i
asked
is
there
no
cure
for
this
awful
thing
no
antitoxin
he
shook
his
head
sadly
we
have
been
studying
it
for
years
the
only
hope
is
in
their
complete
isolation
if
we
stay
here
and
a
second
epidemic
breaks
out
he
shrugged
hopelessly
and
swank
buried
his
face
in
the
enough
i
said
sternly
triplett
when
can
we
leave
tonight
sir
he
answered
with
his
old
subservience
i
got
her
completely
stored
watered
and
ready
come
on
i
said
shortly
we
must
get
william
henry
thomas
we
swam
ashore
dejectedly
each
i
know
contemplating
suicide
for
an
hour
we
visited
our
friends
for
them
it
was
but
a
friendly
call
for
us
the
agony
of
parting
gentle
dignified
baahaabaa
shall
i
ever
forget
you
as
you
stood
with
your
hands
resting
on
my
shoulder
confidently
expecting
to
see
me
on
the
morrow
merry
kindly
ablutiluti
and
moolitonu
oh
that
i
might
send
some
message
across
the
waste
of
waters
to
tell
your
loving
hearts
of
the
love
which
still
kindles
in
mine
we
did
not
dare
visit
our
wives
at
dusk
that
our
conference
might
be
unnoticed
we
found
our
way
to
the
william
henry
thomas
family
tree
he
came
down
instantly
all
his
old
deference
was
gone
something
in
the
straight
look
of
his
eye
told
me
that
his
christening
had
worked
a
tremendous
moral
change
in
the
man
but
i
was
not
prepared
for
its
extent
not
me
he
said
briefly
when
we
explained
the
necessity
of
our
departure
not
by
a
damn
sight
in
vain
we
reasoned
urged
and
argued
do
you
want
to
go
back
to
your
own
people
asked
swank
weakly
a
mocking
laugh
was
the
reply
my
own
people
who
was
i
among
my
own
people
just
a
bunch
of
first
names
no
last
name
at
all
william
henry
thomas
that
a
hell
of
a
bunch
of
names
who
am
i
here
fatakahala
flower
of
darkness
i
guess
that
be
about
all
good
night
gentlemen
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
he
bounded
up
his
tree
and
disappeared
i
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
tree
and
tried
to
argue
further
with
him
remember
henry
james
i
shouted
think
of
charles
henry
george
it
was
in
vain
swank
started
after
him
but
as
he
reached
the
a
large
struck
him
squarely
on
the
top
of
the
head
and
he
fell
back
stunned
still
further
depressed
we
made
our
way
back
to
the
kawa
our
hearts
aching
as
with
the
hurt
of
burns
a
dull
throbbing
torture
drink
said
captain
triplett
in
his
most
treacly
manner
he
held
out
a
cup
of
the
most
deadly
beverage
of
the
islands
it
is
mixed
with
phosphorus
and
glows
and
tastes
like
i
saw
his
plan
and
for
once
was
grateful
we
took
the
bowl
from
his
hands
and
filed
into
the
tiny
cabin
each
picking
out
a
corner
to
fall
in
in
silence
we
filled
our
shells
and
raised
them
to
our
lips
the
last
thought
of
each
of
us
for
our
lost
loved
ones
hours
perhaps
days
later
i
was
dimly
aware
of
a
soft
sobbing
sound
near
my
ear
was
it
swank
crying
and
then
i
realized
that
it
was
the
chuckling
of
water
under
the
kawa
counter
as
manned
by
the
intrepid
triplett
she
merrily
footed
it
over
the
wrinkled
sea
chaptek
x
once
more

foots
the
sea
triplett
observations
and
our
assistance
the
death
of
the
lost
an
orgy
of
desperation
oblivion
and
excess
the
kawa
brings
us
home
our
reception
in
papeete
a
celebration
at
the
tiare
that
triplett
refitting
of
the
kawa
had
been
thorough
and
seamanlike
was
amply
proven
by
the
speed
with
which
she
traveled
under
the
favoring
trades
when
our
saddened
but
still
intrepid
ship
company
reassembled
on
our
limited
quarterdeck
there
was
no
sign
of
land
visible
in
any
direction
the
horizon
stretched
about
our
collective
heads
like
an
enormous
wire
halo
it
was
as
if
the
filberts
had
never
existed
the
captain
alone
was
cheerful
joy
bubbled
from
that
calloused
heart
of
his
in
striking
contrast
to
the
gloom
of
his
companions
most
of
the
time
he
was
our
helmsman
his
eye
cocked
aloft
at
the
taut
halyards
of
occasionally
glancing
from
the
sun
to
the
which
bloomed
in
a
shell
of
fresh
water
lashed
to
an
improvised
binnacle
at
regular
intervals
he
took
observations
figured
the
results
and
jotted
down
our
probable
course
on
his
chart
this
document
we
could
scarcely
bear
to
look
at
for
upon
it
our
beloved
island
figured
prominently
but
the
course
of
the
kawa
interested
us
it
was
a
contradictory
course
and
even
triplett
seemed
puzzled
by
the
results
of
his
calculations
ca
quite
figger
it
out
he
would
mutter
lowering
the
astrolabe
from
its
aim
at
the
sun
accordin
to
this
here
we
orter
be
our
latitude
but
the
answer
comes
out
different
too
much
jackass
and
too
little
quadrant
snapped
swank
whose
nerves
were
still
like
e
strings
little
by
little
however
the
calm
of
the
great
ocean
invaded
our
souls
and
that
influence
mentioned
in
so
many
letters
of
consolation
the
hand
of
time
soothed
the
pain
in
our
hearts
i
think
it
was
the
quiet
whinney
who
brought
the
most
reasoned
philosophy
to
bear
on
the
situation
they
will
forget
he
said
one
evening
as
we
sat
watching
the
double
cross
slowly
revolve
about
its
axis
we
must
remember
that
they
are
a
race
of
children
they
have
no
written
records
of
the
past
no
anticipations
of
the
future
they
live
for
the
present
childlike
they
will
grieve
deeply
for
a
day
maybe
then
another
sun
will
rise
baahaabaa
will
give
another
picnic
he
sighed
deeply
the
tragedy
of
it
is
that
their
memories
should
be
so
short
and
ours
so
long
i
commented
yes
agreed
swank
but
i
suppose
we
ought
to
be
thankful
they
were
a
wonderful
people
it
was
a
wonderful
experience
and
no
matter
what
of
the
future
may
do
to
me
my
pictures
were
a
success
in
the
filberts
blessed
old
swank
he
always
looked
on
the
bright
side
of
things
day
by
day
matters
mended
and
our
spirits
rose
we
began
to
think
more
and
more
of
getting
in
touch
with
civilization
what
a
tale
we
should
have
to
tell
how
we
should
put
it
over
the
other
explorers
with
their
trite
solomons
and
threadbare
marquesas
where
do
you
think
we
land
captain
i
asked
triplett
hard
to
say
he
answered
accordin
to
i
a
straight
course
for
anywhere
but
accordin
to
the
jackass
he
had
dropped
the
word
quadrant
since
swank
thrust
we
spinnin
a
web
round
these
seas
from
where
we
started
to
nowhere

where
we

baahaabaa
mourning
the
departure
of
his
friends
in
all
the
history
of
great
friendships
there
is
nothing
more
touching
and
more
noble
than
the
beautiful
bond
which
existed
between
baahaabaa
the
simple
primitive
chief
of
the
filbertines
and
the
white
men
who
spent
the
happiest
months
of
their
lives
on
his
island
and
then
so
strangely
vanished
for
several
days
after
their
departure
he
spoke
no
word
but
every
evening
at
sunset
he
took
his
place
opposite
an
opening
in
the
reef
where
the
kawa
had
first
made
her
appearance
and
there
he
sat
until
darkness
covered
him
whom
are
you
awaiting
his
chieftains
asked
him
he
shook
his
head
mournfully
memories
in
the
filberts
are
mercifully
short
then
placing
his
hand
over
his
heart
he
said
i
know
not
who
it
is
but
something
is
gone
from
here
three
weeks
later
when
this
photograph
was
taken
he
was
still
keeping
up
his
lonely
vigil
we
tried
to
help
him
while
the
captain
pointed
his
astrolabe
sunward
and
announced
the
figures
whinney
and
i
like
tailors
assistants
took
them
down
whinney
doing
the
adding
i
the
subtracting
and
swank
the
charting
the
results
were
confusion
worse
confounded
and
then
a
dreadful
thing
happened
the
sickened
and
died
whether
some
splashed
into
the
shell
or
whether
it
was
just
change
of
environment
i
do
not
know
but
day
by
day
it
drooped
and
faded
i
shall
never
forget
the
night
she
breathed
her
last
with
white
faces
we
sat
about
the
tiny
brown
bowl
in
which
lay
our
hope
of
orientation
in
triplett
great
rough
paw
was
a
filler
of
fresh
water
which
he
gently
dropped
on
the
flowerlet
unturned
face
at
exactly
solar
time
the
tiny
petals
fluttered
faintly
and
closed
she
gone
groaned
triplett
and
dashed
a
tear
the
size
of
a
egg
from
his
furrowed
cheek
in
that
ghastly
light
we
stared
at
each
other
we
were
lost
from
then
on
we
gave
up
all
attempts
at
navigation
and
went
in
for
plain
sailing
taking
an
approximate
north
from
sun
and
stars
we
simply
headed
our
tight
little
craft
on
her
way
and
let
her
pound
a
sort
of
desperate
feeling
the
panic
which
always
comes
to
those
who
are
lost
led
us
to
wild
outbursts
of
gaiety
and
certain
excesses
in
the
matter
of
use
of
our
supplies
every
evening
we
opened
fresh
gourds
of
and
made
large
inroads
into
our
stores
of
pickled
and
raw
crawfish
how
long
this
kept
up
i
can
not
say
for
we
had
given
up
time
reckoning
along
with
other
forms
of
arithmetic
but
i
well
remember
that
it
was
the
captain
who
had
to
intervene
at
last
look
here
boys
he
said
do
you
realize
that
you
eatin
drinkin
yourselves
outer
house
an
home
we
got
jest
a
week
grub
in
our
lockers
if
we
go
on
short
rations
beyond
that
he
waved
his
arm
toward
the
ocean
as
if
to
say
overboard
for
ours
look
here
cried
swank
excitedly
do
you
suppose
i
want
to
go
in
for
one
of
these
slow
starvation
stunts
perishing
miserably
on
half
a
biscuit
a
day
o
man
that
old
stuff
every
explorer
that
ever
wrote
has
done
that
you
know
falling
insensible
in
the
boat
drifting
around
for
weeks
being
towed
into
port
sunbaked
like
mummies
not
on
your
life
what
i
propose
is
one
final
party
let
eat
the
whole
outfit
tonight
hook
line
and
sinker
we
carried
the
proposition
by
acclamation
except
triplett
who
spat
sourly
to
windward
a
thing
few
men
can
do
and
we
were
as
good
as
our
word
late
into
the
night
we
roared
our
over
the
indifferent
ocean
pledging
our
lost
ones
singing
laughing
and
weeping
with
the
abandon
of
lost
sheep
with
triplett
it
was
a
case
of
forcible
feeding
for
he
kept
trying
to
secrete
his
share
of
the
menu
in
various
parts
of
his
person
slipping
fistsful
of
crawfish
in
his
and
pouring
his
cup
of
into
an
old
which
rolled
in
the
ship
waist
pinioning
his
arms
we
squirted
the
fiery
liquid
between
his
set
jaws
after
which
he
too
gave
himself
up
to
unrestrained
celebration
our
supplies
lasted
for
two
days
and
for
two
days
our
wild
orgy
continued
we
have
all
read
of
the
hunter
lost
in
trackless
forest
wilds
who
finally
falls
exhausted
on
his
pommel
and
is
brought
safely
home
by
his
mustang
that
is
exactly
what
happened
to
us
i
know
i
am
departing
from
literary
custom
when
i
abandon
the
picture
of
slow
starvation
with
its
attractive
episodes
of
madness
cannibalism
and
suicide
which
make
up
the
final
scene
of
most
tales
of
adventure
but
i
must
tell
the
truth
while
we
caroused
our
helm
was
free
the
tiller
banging
sail
flapping
boom
gibing
blocks
rattling
it
was
as
if
we
had
thrown
the
reins
of
guidance
on
the
neck
of
our
staunch
little
seahorse
and
she
superbly
sturdy
creature
proceeded
to
bring
us
home
on
we
went
across
the
waters
steered
only
by
fate
in
the
midst
of
a
rousing
rendering
of
hail
hail
the
gang
all
here
we
were
startled
by
a
grinding
crash
that
threw
us
in
a
heap
on
the
floor
down
the
companion
way
burst
a
flood
of
green
water
through
which
we
struggled
to
the
steeply
slanting
deck
where
on
ourport
bow
i
glimpsed
the
picture
of
a
pleasant
sandy
beach
trees
ships
docks
a
large
white
hotel
and
hundreds
of
people
white
and
brown
in
bathing
in
one
thundering
burst
of
amazement
the
truth
swept
over
me
we
were
in
the
harbor
of
papeete
in
the
next
instant
strong
arms
seized
me
and
i
was
borne
through
the
breakers
and
up
the
beach
well
they
were
all
there

fred

roared
in

well
as
i
live

breathe
walter
traprock
it
was
joe
conrad
i
told
my
story
that
night
in
the
of
the
tiare
or
at
least
i
told
just
enough
of
it
to
completely
knock
my
audience
off
their
seats
for
many
good
reasons
i
avoided
exact
details
of
latitude
longitude
and
the
like
no
island
is
sacred
among
explorers
gentlemen
i
said
rather
neatly
i
can
not
give
you
the
latitude
or
longitude
but
i
will
say
that
their
pulchritude
is
the
place
was
in
an
uproar
they
plied
me
with
questions
and
funk
it
was
a
night
of
rejoicing
and
triumph
which
i
shall
never
forget

which
