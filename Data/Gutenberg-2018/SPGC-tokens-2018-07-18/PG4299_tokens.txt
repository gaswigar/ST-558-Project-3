the
whirlpool
by
george
gissing
part
the
first
chapter
harvey
rolfe
was
old
enough
to
dine
with
deliberation
young
and
healthy
enough
to
sauce
with
appetite
the
dishes
he
thoughtfully
selected
you
perceived
in
him
the
imperfect
epicure
his
club
had
no
culinary
fame
the
dinner
was
merely
tolerable
but
rolfe
unfinished
palate
flattered
the
cook
he
knew
nothing
of
vintages
it
sufficed
him
to
distinguish
between
bordeaux
and
burgundy
yet
one
saw
him
raise
his
glass
and
peer
at
the
liquor
with
eye
of
connoisseur
all
unaffectedly
for
he
was
conscious
of
his
shortcoming
in
the
art
of
delicate
living
and
never
vaunted
his
satisfactions
he
had
known
the
pasture
of
poverty
and
the
table
as
it
is
set
by
london
landladies
to
look
back
on
these
things
was
to
congratulate
himself
that
nowadays
he
dined
beyond
the
achievement
of
a
vague
personal
distinction
at
the
metropolitan
club
he
had
done
nothing
to
make
himself
a
man
of
note
and
it
was
doubtful
whether
more
than
two
or
three
of
the
members
really
liked
him
or
regarded
him
with
genuine
interest
his
introduction
to
this
circle
he
owed
to
an
old
friend
hugh
carnaby
whose
social
position
was
much
more
clearly
defined
hugh
carnaby
the
rambler
the
sportsman
and
now
for
a
twelvemonth
the
of
ascott
larkfield
through
carnaby
people
learnt
as
much
of
his
friend
history
as
it
concerned
anyone
to
know
that
harvey
rolfe
had
begun
with
the
study
of
medicine
had
given
it
up
in
disgust
subsequently
was
business
and
withdrew
from
it
on
inheriting
a
competency
they
were
natives
of
the
same
county
and
learnt
their
latin
together
at
the
grammar
school
of
greystone
the
midland
town
which
was
missed
by
the
steam
highroad
and
so
preserves
much
of
the
beauty
and
tranquillity
of
days
gone
by
rolfe
seldom
spoke
of
his
own
affairs
but
in
talking
of
travel
he
had
been
heard
to
mention
that
his
father
had
engineered
certain
lines
of
foreign
railway
it
seemed
that
harvey
had
no
purpose
in
life
save
that
of
enjoying
himself
obviously
he
read
a
good
deal
and
carnaby
credited
him
with
profound
historical
knowledge
but
he
neither
wrote
nor
threatened
to
do
so
something
of
cynicism
appeared
in
his
talk
of
public
matters
politics
amused
him
and
his
social
views
lacked
consistency
tending
however
to
an
indolent
conservatism
despite
his
convivial
qualities
he
had
traits
of
the
reserved
even
of
the
unsociable
man
a
slight
awkwardness
in
bearing
a
mute
shyness
with
strangers
a
hesitancy
in
ordinary
talk
and
occasional
bluntness
of
assertion
or
contradiction
suggesting
a
contempt
which
possibly
he
did
not
intend
hugh
carnaby
declared
that
the
true
rolfe
only
showed
himself
after
a
bottle
of
wine
maintained
moreover
that
harvey
had
vastly
improved
since
he
entered
upon
a
substantial
income
when
rolfe
was
five
and
twenty
hugh
being
two
years
younger
they
met
after
a
long
separation
and
found
each
other
intolerable
a
decade
later
their
meeting
led
to
hearty
friendship
rolfe
had
become
independent
and
was
tasting
his
freedom
in
a
twelvemonth
travel
the
men
came
face
to
face
one
day
on
the
deck
of
a
steamer
at
port
said
physically
rolfe
had
changed
so
much
that
the
other
had
a
difficulty
in
recognising
him
morally
the
change
was
not
less
marked
as
carnaby
very
soon
became
aware
at
this
process
of
development
was
by
no
means
arrested
but
its
slow
and
subtle
working
escaped
observation
unless
it
were
that
of
harvey
rolfe
himself
his
guest
this
evening
in
a
quiet
corner
of
the
where
he
generally
sat
was
a
man
ten
years
his
junior
named
morphew
slim
with
sandy
hair
and
pale
delicate
features
of
more
sensibility
than
intelligence
restless
vivacious
talking
incessantly
in
a
low
rapid
voice
with
frequent
nervous
laughs
which
threw
back
his
drooping
head
a
difference
of
costume
rolfe
wore
morning
dress
morphew
the
suit
of
ceremony
accentuated
the
younger
man
advantage
in
natural
and
acquired
graces
otherwise
they
presented
the
contrast
of
character
and
insignificance
rolfe
had
a
shaven
chin
a
weathered
complexion
thick
brown
hair
the
penumbra
of
had
touched
his
countenance
softening
here
and
there
a
line
which
told
of
temperament
in
excess
at
this
moment
his
manner
inclined
to
a
bluff
jocularity
due
in
some
measure
to
the
bottle
of
wine
before
him
as
also
was
the
tinge
of
colour
upon
his
cheek
he
spoke
briefly
but
listened
with
smiling
interest
to
his
guest
continuous
talk
this
ran
on
the
subject
of
the
with
which
the
young
man
boasted
some
practical
acquaintance
do
speculate
at
all
morphew
asked
know
how
to
go
about
it
replied
the
other
in
his
deeper
note
seems
to
me
to
be
the
simplest
thing
in
the
world
if
one
is
content
with
moderate
profits
i
going
in
for
it
seriously
cautiously
as
a
matter
of
business
i
studied
the
thing
got
it
up
as
i
used
to
work
at
something
for
an
exam
and
here
you
see
i
made
five
pounds
at
a
stroke
five
pounds
suppose
i
make
that
every
now
and
then
it
worth
the
trouble
you
know
it
mounts
up
and
i
shall
never
stand
to
lose
much
you
see
it
tripcony
interest
that
i
should
make
profits
not
quite
sure
of
that
but
it
let
me
explain
these
two
had
come
to
know
each
other
under
peculiar
circumstances
a
year
ago
rolfe
was
at
brussels
staying
his
custom
when
abroad
at
a
hotel
unfrequented
by
english
folk
one
evening
on
his
return
from
the
theatre
he
learnt
that
a
young
man
of
his
own
nationality
lay
seriously
ill
in
a
room
at
the
top
of
the
house
harvey
moved
by
compassion
visited
the
unfortunate
englishman
listened
to
his
ravings
and
played
the
part
of
good
samaritan
on
recovery
the
stranger
made
full
disclosure
of
his
position
being
at
brussels
on
a
holiday
he
had
got
into
the
company
of
gamblers
and
after
winning
a
large
sum
ten
thousand
francs
he
declared
had
lost
not
only
that
but
all
else
that
he
possessed
including
his
jewellery
he
had
gambled
deliberately
he
wanted
money
money
and
saw
no
other
way
of
obtaining
it
in
the
expansive
mood
of
convalescence
cecil
morphew
left
no
detail
of
his
story
unrevealed
he
was
of
gentle
birth
and
had
a
private
income
of
three
hundred
pounds
charged
upon
the
estate
of
a
distant
relative
his
profession
the
bar
could
not
be
remunerative
for
years
and
other
prospects
he
had
none
the
misery
of
his
situation
lay
in
the
fact
that
he
was
desperately
in
love
with
the
daughter
of
people
who
looked
upon
him
as
little
better
than
a
pauper
the
girl
had
pledged
herself
to
him
but
would
not
marry
without
her
consent
of
which
there
was
no
hope
till
he
had
at
least
trebled
his
means
his
choice
of
a
profession
was
absurd
dictated
merely
by
social
opinion
he
should
have
been
working
hard
in
a
commercial
office
or
at
some
pursuit
naturally
he
turned
again
to
the
thought
of
gambling
this
time
the
great
legalised
game
of
hazard
wherein
he
was
as
little
likely
to
prosper
as
among
the
blacklegs
of
brussels
rolfe
liked
him
for
his
ingenuousness
and
for
the
vein
of
poetry
in
his
nature
the
love
affair
still
went
on
but
morphew
seldom
alluded
to
it
and
his
seasoned
friend
thought
of
it
as
a
youthful
ailment
which
would
pass
and
be
forgotten
convinced
said
the
young
man
presently
any
one
who
really
gives
his
mind
to
it
can
speculate
with
moderate
success
look
at
the
big
men
the
brokers
and
the
company
promoters
and
so
on
i
met
some
of
them
and
there
nothing
in
them
nothing
now
there
bennet
frothingham
you
know
him
i
think
rolfe
nodded
what
do
you
think
of
him
is
he
a
very
ordinary
fellow
how
has
he
got
such
a
position
i
told
he
began
just
in
a
small
way
by
chance
no
doubt
found
it
so
easy
to
make
money
he
was
surprised
at
his
success
tripcony
has
told
me
a
lot
about
him
why
the
britannia
brings
him
fifteen
thousand
a
year
and
he
must
be
in
a
score
of
other
things
know
nothing
about
the
figures
said
rolfe
i
should
put
much
faith
in
tripcony
but
frothingham
you
may
be
sure
is
quite
an
ordinary
man
well
of
course
there
a
certain
knack
and
then
experience
morphew
emptied
his
glass
and
refilled
it
nearly
all
the
tables
in
the
room
were
now
occupied
and
the
general
hum
of
talk
gave
security
to
intimate
dialogue
flushed
and
the
young
man
presently
leaned
forward
i
could
count
upon
five
hundred
she
would
take
the
step
that
settled
what
do
you
think
plenty
of
people
live
very
well
on
less
want
my
serious
opinion
you
be
serious
i
think
that
the
educated
man
who
marries
on
less
than
a
thousand
is
either
mad
or
a
criminal
we
wo
talk
about
it
they
rose
and
walked
towards
the
rolfe
giving
a
nod
here
and
there
as
he
passed
acquaintances
in
the
hall
someone
addressed
him
does
carnaby
take
this
affair
affair
you
know
their
house
has
been
robbed
stripped
it
in
the
evening
papers
rolfe
went
on
into
the
and
read
the
report
of
his
friend
misfortune
the
carnabys
occupied
a
house
in
hamilton
terrace
during
their
absence
from
home
last
night
there
had
been
a
clean
sweep
of
all
such
things
of
value
as
could
easily
be
removed
the
disappearance
of
their
housekeeper
and
the
fact
that
this
woman
had
contrived
the
absence
of
the
servants
from
nine
till
midnight
left
no
mystery
in
the
matter
the
clubmen
talked
of
it
with
amusement
hard
lines
to
be
sure
for
carnaby
and
yet
harder
for
his
wife
who
had
lost
no
end
of
jewellery
but
the
thing
was
so
neatly
and
completely
done
one
must
needs
laugh
one
or
two
husbands
who
enjoyed
the
luxury
of
a
housekeeper
betrayed
their
uneasiness
a
discussion
arose
on
the
characteristics
of
housekeepers
in
general
and
spread
over
the
vast
subject
of
domestic
management
not
often
debated
at
the
metropolitan
club
in
general
talk
of
this
kind
rolfe
never
took
part
smoking
his
pipe
he
listened
and
laughed
and
was
at
moments
thoughtful
cecil
morphew
rapidly
consuming
cigarettes
as
he
lay
back
in
a
soft
chair
pointed
the
moral
of
the
story
in
favour
of
humble
domesticity
in
half
an
hour
his
guest
having
taken
leave
rolfe
put
on
his
overcoat
and
stepped
out
into
the
cold
clammy
november
night
he
was
overtaken
by
a
fellow
metropolitan
a
grizzled
man
who
laid
a
tremulous
hand
upon
his
arm
me
rolfe
have
you
seen
frothingham
recently
for
a
month
i
thought
perhaps
i
was
wondering
what
he
thought
about
the
colebrook
smash
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
heard
unpleasant
rumours
do
you
should
you
think
the
colebrook
affair
would
affect
the
britannia
in
any
way
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
this
man
had
confided
his
doubts
and
timidities
to
harvey
rolfe
he
had
a
small
but
to
him
important
interest
in
bennet
frothingham
affairs
and
seemed
to
spend
most
of
his
time
in
eliciting
opinion
on
the
stability
you
be
much
more
comfortable
said
rolfe
rather
bluntly
you
had
your
money
in
some
other
kind
of
security
but
my
dear
sir
twelve
and
a
half
per
cent
twelve
and
a
half
i
hold
preference
shares
of
the
original
issue
i
afraid
you
must
take
your
chance
piped
the
other
in
alarm
do
mean
that
mean
nothing
and
know
nothing
i
the
last
man
to
consult
about
such
things
and
rolfe
with
an
abrupt
beckoned
to
a
passing
hansom
the
address
he
gave
was
hugh
carnaby
in
hamilton
terrace
twice
already
the
horse
had
slipped
at
slimy
crossings
when
near
the
top
of
regent
street
it
fell
full
length
and
the
abrupt
stoppage
caused
a
collision
of
wheels
with
another
hansom
which
was
just
passing
at
full
speed
in
the
same
direction
rolfe
managed
to
alight
in
the
ordinary
way
and
at
once
heard
himself
greeted
by
a
familiar
voice
from
the
other
cab
his
acquaintance
showed
a
pallid
drawn
all
but
cadaverous
visage
with
eyes
which
concealed
pain
or
weariness
under
their
friendly
smile
abbott
was
the
man
name
formerly
a
lecturer
at
a
provincial
college
he
had
resigned
his
post
on
marrying
and
taken
to
journalism
want
to
speak
to
you
rolfe
he
said
hurriedly
i
have
a
moment
to
spare
going
to
euston
could
you
come
along
for
a
few
minutes
the
vehicles
were
not
damaged
abbott
driver
got
quickly
out
of
the
crowd
and
the
two
men
continued
their
conversation
you
know
anything
of
wager
inquired
the
journalist
with
a
troubled
look
came
to
see
me
a
few
evenings
ago
late
he
did
to
borrow
money
was
it
yes
thought
so
he
came
to
me
for
the
same
said
he
got
a
berth
at
southampton
lie
of
course
the
fellow
has
disappeared
and
left
his
children
left
them
in
a
at
hammersmith
how
that
for
cool
brutality
the
landlady
found
my
wife
address
and
came
to
see
her
address
left
out
on
purpose
i
dare
say
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
take
care
of
the
poor
little
oh
damn
the
matter
driving
me
mad
teeth
i
think
i
have
every
one
wrenched
out
of
my
head
if
this
goes
on
never
mind
what
do
you
think
of
wager
remember
when
we
were
at
guy
he
used
to
advocate
the
nationalisation
of
offspring
probably
he
had
some
personal
interest
in
the
matter
even
then
i
do
know
whether
to
set
the
police
after
him
or
not
it
would
benefit
the
children
i
suppose
it
no
use
hunting
for
his
family
much
i
should
say
lucky
we
have
no
children
of
our
own
worst
of
it
is
i
like
the
poor
little
wretches
and
my
wife
does
either
we
must
find
a
home
for
them
say
abbott
you
must
let
me
go
halves
at
that
it
no
why
should
you
support
wager
children
relatives
of
ours
unfortunately
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
going
down
to
waterbury
he
looked
at
his
watch
minutes
shall
i
do
it
there
a
good
local
paper
the
and
i
have
the
offer
of
i
shall
buy
if
possible
and
live
in
the
country
for
a
year
or
two
to
pick
up
my
health
ca
say
i
love
london
might
get
into
country
journalism
for
good
curse
this
torment
in
tottenham
court
road
rolfe
bade
his
friend
goodbye
and
the
cab
rushed
on
chapter
it
was
half
past
ten
when
rolfe
knocked
at
the
door
in
hamilton
terrace
he
learnt
from
the
servant
that
carnaby
was
at
home
and
had
company
in
the
room
known
as
the
library
four
men
sat
smoking
their
voices
pealed
into
the
hall
as
the
door
opened
and
a
boisterous
welcome
greeted
the
newcomer
appearance
to
condole
cried
hugh
striding
forward
with
his
air
and
holding
out
his
big
hand
doubt
they
having
a
high
old
time
at
the
club
does
it
please
them
does
it
tickle
them
naturally
there
the
compensation
my
boy
you
contribute
to
the
gaiety
of
your
friends
carnaby
was
a
fair
example
of
the
englishman
tall
brawny
limber
not
uncomely
with
a
red
neck
a
powerful
jaw
and
a
keen
eye
something
more
of
repose
of
and
a
slightly
more
intellectual
brow
would
have
made
him
the
best
type
of
conquering
civilising
briton
he
came
of
good
family
but
had
small
inheritance
his
tongue
told
of
domination
his
physique
and
carriage
showed
the
horseman
the
the
nomad
hugh
had
never
bent
over
books
since
the
day
when
he
declined
the
university
and
got
leave
to
join
colonel
bosworth
exploring
party
in
the
caucasus
after
a
boyhood
of
straitened
circumstances
he
profited
by
a
skilful
stewardship
which
allowed
him
to
hope
for
some
seven
hundred
a
year
his
elder
brother
miles
a
fine
fellow
who
went
into
the
army
pinching
himself
to
benefit
hugh
and
their
sister
ruth
miles
was
now
major
carnaby
active
on
the
frontier
ruth
was
wife
of
a
missionary
in
some
land
of
swamps
doomed
by
climate
but
of
spirit
indomitable
it
seemed
strange
that
hugh
at
five
and
thirty
had
done
nothing
particular
perhaps
his
income
explained
it
too
small
for
traditional
purposes
just
large
enough
to
foster
indolence
for
hugh
had
not
even
followed
up
his
promise
of
becoming
an
explorer
he
had
merely
rambled
mostly
in
pursuit
of
fowl
or
quadruped
when
he
married
all
hope
for
him
was
at
an
end
the
beautiful
and
brilliant
daughter
of
a
fashionable
widow
her
income
a
trifle
more
than
carnaby
own
devoted
to
the
life
of
cities
wherein
she
shone
an
enchantress
whose
spell
would
not
easily
be
broken
before
whom
her
husband
bowed
in
delighted
subservience
such
a
woman
might
flatter
hugh
pride
but
could
scarce
be
expected
to
draw
out
his
latent
energies
and
capabilities
this
year
for
the
first
time
he
had
visited
no
wild
country
his
journeying
led
only
to
paris
to
vienna
in
due
season
he
shot
his
fifty
brace
on
somebody
but
the
sport
did
not
exhilarate
him
an
odd
and
improbable
alliance
that
between
hugh
carnaby
and
harvey
rolfe
yet
in
several
ways
they
suited
each
other
memories
had
a
little
not
much
to
do
with
it
more
of
the
essence
of
the
matter
was
their
feeling
of
likeness
in
difference
ten
years
ago
carnaby
felt
inclined
to
call
his
old
a
harvey
saw
nothing
in
hugh
but
robust
snobbishness
nowadays
they
had
the
pleasant
sense
of
understanding
each
other
on
most
points
and
the
result
was
a
good
deal
of
honest
mutual
admiration
the
one
physical
vigour
and
adroitness
the
other
active
mind
liberal
thoughts
studious
habits
proved
reciprocally
attractive
though
in
unlike
ways
both
were
impressively
modern
of
late
it
had
seemed
as
if
the
man
of
open
air
checked
in
his
natural
courses
thrown
back
upon
his
meditations
turned
to
the
student
with
hope
of
guidance
in
new
paths
of
counsel
amid
unfamiliar
obstacles
to
the
observant
rolfe
his
position
abounded
in
speculative
interest
with
the
course
of
years
each
had
lost
many
a
harsher
characteristic
whilst
the
inner
man
matured
that
their
former
relations
were
gradually
being
reversed
neither
perhaps
had
consciously
noted
but
even
in
the
jests
which
passed
between
them
on
harvey
arrival
this
evening
it
appeared
plainly
enough
that
hugh
carnaby
no
longer
felt
the
slightest
inclination
to
regard
his
friend
as
an
inferior
the
room
called
library
contained
one
small
case
of
books
which
dealt
with
travel
and
sport
furniture
of
the
ordinary
kind
still
new
told
of
easy
circumstances
and
domestic
comfort
round
about
the
walls
hung
a
few
paintings
and
photographs
intermingled
with
the
stuffed
heads
of
animals
slain
in
the
chase
notably
that
of
a
great
ibex
with
magnificent
horns
now
tell
me
all
about
it
said
rolfe
as
he
mixed
himself
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
do
see
that
anything
has
gone
from
this
room
you
cried
his
host
with
a
scornful
laugh
are
my
pistols
where
the
made
into
a
paperweight
and
he
raised
his
voice
to
a
shout
of
comical
despair
my
see
wish
did
it
must
break
the
record
for
a
neat
do
you
think
and
they
never
be
caught
i
bet
you
anything
you
like
they
wo
the
job
was
planned
weeks
ago
that
woman
came
into
the
house
with
no
other
purpose
did
your
wife
know
anything
about
her
can
one
know
about
such
people
there
were
references
i
believe
as
valuable
as
references
usually
are
she
must
be
an
old
hand
but
i
sick
of
the
subject
let
drop
you
were
interrupted
hollings
what
about
that
bustard
a
very
tall
spare
man
who
seemed
to
rouse
himself
from
a
nap
resumed
his
story
of
in
spain
last
spring
carnaby
who
knew
the
country
well
listened
with
lively
interest
and
followed
with
reminiscences
of
his
own
he
told
of
a
certain
boar
shot
in
the
sierras
which
weighed
something
like
four
hundred
pounds
he
talked
too
of
flamingoes
on
the
of
the
guadalquivir
of
punting
day
after
day
across
the
tawny
expanse
of
water
of
cooking
his
meals
on
sandy
islets
at
a
fire
made
of
tamarisk
and
thistle
of
lying
wakeful
in
the
damp
chilly
nights
listening
to
frogs
and
bitterns
then
again
of
his
on
the
cordilleras
of
castile
when
he
brought
down
that
fine
fellow
whose
head
adorned
his
room
the
horns
just
inches
long
and
in
the
joy
of
these
recollections
there
seemed
to
sound
a
regretful
note
as
if
he
spoke
of
things
gone
by
and
irrecoverable
no
longer
for
him
one
of
the
men
present
had
recently
been
in
cyprus
and
mentioned
it
with
disgust
rolfe
also
had
visited
the
island
and
remembered
it
much
more
agreeably
his
impressions
seeming
to
be
chiefly
gastronomic
he
recalled
the
exquisite
flavour
of
cyprian
hares
the
fat
francolin
the
delicious
beccaficoes
in
commanderia
wine
with
merry
banter
from
carnaby
professing
to
despise
a
man
who
knew
nothing
of
game
but
its
taste
the
conversation
reverted
to
technicalities
of
sport
full
of
terms
and
phrases
unintelligible
to
harvey
recounting
feats
with
and
the
deadly
results
of
a
a
or
of
slugs
and
boasting
of
a
and
left
with
no
hugh
appeared
to
forget
all
about
his
domestic
calamity
only
when
his
guests
rose
did
he
recur
to
it
and
with
an
air
of
contemptuous
impatience
but
he
made
a
sign
to
rolfe
requesting
him
to
stay
and
at
midnight
the
two
friends
sat
alone
together
has
gone
to
her
mother
began
hugh
in
a
changed
voice
poor
girl
takes
it
pluckily
it
a
damnable
thing
you
know
for
a
woman
to
lose
her
rings
and
bracelets
and
so
on
even
such
a
woman
as
sibyl
she
tried
to
laugh
it
off
but
i
could
see
we
must
buy
them
again
that
all
and
that
reminds
me
what
your
real
opinion
of
frothingham
harvey
laughed
such
a
lot
of
people
go
about
asking
that
question
it
would
make
rather
uneasy
if
i
had
anything
at
stake
do
so
it
struck
me
the
fact
is
we
have
a
good
deal
at
stake
the
dowager
swears
by
frothingham
i
believe
every
penny
she
has
is
in
the
britannia
one
way
or
another
a
wide
net
said
rolfe
musingly
britannia
loan
assurance
investment
and
banking
company
limited
very
good
name
i
often
thought
but
look
here
you
do
seriously
doubt
opinion
is
worthless
i
know
no
more
of
finance
than
of
the
cabala
frothingham
personally
i
rather
like
and
that
all
i
can
say
fact
is
i
have
been
thinking
of
putting
some
of
my
own
yet
i
do
think
i
shall
we
going
away
for
the
winter
sibyl
wants
to
give
up
the
house
and
i
think
she
right
for
people
like
us
mere
foolery
to
worry
with
a
house
and
a
lot
of
servants
we
neither
of
us
cut
out
for
that
kind
of
thing
sibyl
hates
housekeeping
well
you
ca
expect
a
woman
like
her
to
manage
a
pack
of
thieving
lying
lazy
servants
the
housekeeper
idea
has
been
a
conspicuous
success
you
see
and
there
nothing
for
it
but
hotel
or
you
remember
said
rolfe
hinted
something
of
the
kind
a
year
ago
but
well
you
know
when
people
marry
they
generally
look
for
a
certain
natural
consequence
if
we
have
no
children
it
be
all
right
rolfe
meditated
for
a
moment
remember
that
fellow
wager
the
man
you
met
at
abbott
his
wife
died
a
year
ago
and
now
he
has
bolted
leaving
his
two
children
in
a
a
damned
scoundrel
cried
hugh
with
a
note
of
honest
indignation
yes
but
there
something
to
be
said
for
him
it
a
natural
revolt
against
domestic
bondage
of
course
as
things
are
someone
else
has
to
bear
the
bother
and
expense
but
that
only
our
state
of
barbarism
a
widower
with
two
young
children
and
no
income
imagine
the
position
of
course
he
ought
to
be
able
to
get
rid
of
them
in
some
legitimate
way
state
institution
anything
you
like
that
answers
to
reason
do
know
whether
it
would
work
day
it
will
people
talk
such
sentimental
rubbish
about
children
i
would
have
the
parents
know
nothing
about
them
till
they
ten
or
twelve
years
old
they
a
burden
a
hindrance
a
perpetual
source
of
worry
and
misery
most
wives
are
sacrificed
to
the
next
generation
an
outrageous
absurdity
people
snivel
over
the
deaths
of
babies
i
see
nothing
to
grieve
about
if
a
child
dies
why
the
probabilities
are
it
to
die
if
it
lives
it
lives
and
you
get
survival
of
the
fittest
we
do
want
to
choke
the
world
with
people
most
of
them
rickety
and
wheezing
let
us
be
healthy
and
have
breathing
space
believe
in
said
carnaby
going
away
then
where
to
the
point
replied
hugh
moving
uneasily
see
with
sibyl
i
have
suggested
davos
some
people
she
knows
are
there
girls
who
go
in
for
tobogganing
and
have
a
good
time
but
sibyl
afraid
of
the
cold
i
ca
convince
her
that
it
nothing
to
what
we
endure
here
in
the
beastliness
of
a
london
winter
she
hates
the
thought
of
ice
and
snow
and
mountains
a
great
pity
it
would
do
her
no
end
of
good
i
suppose
we
must
go
to
the
riviera
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
he
resumed
have
a
letter
from
miles
and
you
like
to
see
it
from
a
pile
of
letters
on
the
table
he
selected
one
written
on
two
sheets
of
thin
paper
and
handed
it
to
rolfe
the
writing
was
bold
the
style
vigorous
the
matter
fresh
and
interesting
major
carnaby
had
no
graces
of
expression
but
all
the
more
engrossing
was
his
brief
narrative
of
mountain
warfare
declaring
its
truthfulness
in
every
stroke
of
the
pen
fellow
exclaimed
rolfe
when
he
had
read
to
the
end
fellow
he
and
he
seeing
life
where
you
ought
to
be
my
boy
remarked
rolfe
between
puffs
of
tobacco
dare
say
no
use
thinking
about
it
too
late
i
had
a
son
pursued
harvey
smiling
at
the
hypothesis
think
i
make
a
fighting
man
of
him
or
try
to
at
all
events
he
should
go
out
somewhere
and
beat
the
big
british
drum
one
way
or
another
i
believe
it
our
only
hope
we
rotting
at
home
some
of
us
sunk
in
barbarism
some
coddling
themselves
in
what
the
use
of
preaching
peace
and
civilisation
when
we
know
that
england
just
beginning
her
big
fight
the
fight
that
will
put
all
history
into
the
shade
we
have
to
lead
the
world
it
our
destiny
and
we
must
do
it
by
breaking
heads
that
the
nature
of
the
human
animal
and
will
be
for
ages
to
come
carnaby
nodded
assent
we
were
all
like
your
brother
rolfe
went
on
glad
fighting
in
india
and
not
in
africa
i
ca
love
the
buccaneering
shopkeeper
the
with
a
rifle
ugh
hate
that
kind
of
thing
the
gold
grubbers
and
diamond
bagmen
but
it
part
of
the
march
onward
we
must
have
money
you
know
the
speaker
forehead
wrinkled
and
again
he
moved
uneasily
rolfe
regarded
him
with
a
reflective
air
man
you
saw
here
tonight
carnaby
went
on
short
thick
fellow
his
name
is
dando
he
just
come
back
from
queensland
i
quite
know
what
he
been
doing
but
he
evidently
knows
a
good
deal
about
mines
he
says
he
has
invented
a
new
process
for
getting
gold
out
of
ore
i
do
know
anything
about
it
in
the
early
days
of
mining
he
says
no
end
of
valuable
stuff
was
abandoned
because
they
smelt
it
something
about
pyrites
i
have
a
vague
recollection
of
old
chemistry
lessons
dando
wants
to
start
smelting
works
for
his
new
process
somewhere
in
north
queensland
wants
money
i
dare
say
remarked
the
listener
with
a
twinkle
of
the
eye
suppose
so
it
was
carton
that
brought
him
here
for
the
first
time
a
week
ago
be
worth
thinking
about
you
know
have
no
opinion
my
profound
ignorance
of
everything
keeps
me
in
a
state
of
perpetual
scepticism
it
has
its
advantages
i
dare
say
very
conservative
rolfe
in
your
finance
right
no
doubt
could
you
join
us
at
nice
or
some
such
place
i
rather
thought
of
sticking
to
my
books
but
if
the
fogs
are
very
bad
you
would
seriously
advise
us
to
give
up
the
house
dear
fellow
how
can
you
hesitate
your
wife
is
quite
right
there
not
one
good
word
to
be
said
for
the
ordinary
life
of
an
english
household
flee
from
it
live
anywhere
and
anyhow
but
keep
house
in
england
wherever
i
go
it
the
same
cry
domestic
life
is
played
out
there
is
a
servant
to
be
had
unless
you
a
duke
and
breed
them
on
your
own
estate
all
ordinary
housekeepers
are
at
the
mercy
of
the
filth
and
insolence
of
a
feminine
democracy
before
very
long
we
shall
train
an
army
of
menservants
and
send
the
women
to
the
devil
thing
rolfe
put
in
his
friend
with
a
laugh
noticed
it
of
late
you
getting
to
be
a
regular
a
bit
of
it
i
hate
a
dirty
lying
incapable
creature
all
whether
man
or
woman
no
doubt
they
more
common
in
petticoats
to
the
frothinghams
lately
used
to
think
you
were
there
rather
often
rolfe
gave
a
sort
of
grunt
and
kept
silence
my
mind
pursued
the
other
best
thing
about
alma
is
that
she
appreciates
my
wife
she
has
really
a
great
admiration
for
sibyl
no
sham
about
it
i
sure
i
do
pretend
to
know
much
about
women
but
i
fancy
that
kind
of
thing
is
common
real
friendship
and
admiration
between
them
people
always
say
so
at
all
events
take
refuge
once
more
said
rolfe
my
fathomless
ignorance
he
rose
from
his
chair
and
sat
down
again
on
a
corner
of
the
table
carnaby
stood
up
threw
his
arms
above
his
head
and
yawned
with
animal
vehemence
the
expression
of
an
intolerable
ennui
something
damnably
wrong
with
us
all
that
the
one
thing
certain
for
one
thing
said
rolfe
and
i
too
old
to
do
anything
why
did
i
follow
miles
into
the
army
i
think
i
was
more
cut
out
for
that
than
for
anything
else
i
often
feel
i
should
like
to
go
to
south
africa
and
get
up
a
little
war
of
my
own
rolfe
shouted
with
laughter
half
a
bad
idea
and
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
no
doubt
a
superior
big
game
more
than
that
to
do
in
south
africa
said
harvey
was
looking
at
a
map
in
stanford
window
the
other
day
and
it
amused
me
who
believes
for
a
moment
that
england
will
remain
satisfied
with
bits
here
and
there
we
have
to
swallow
the
whole
of
course
we
shall
go
on
fighting
and
annexing
until
until
the
decline
and
fall
of
the
british
empire
that
has
begun
yet
some
of
us
are
so
that
it
makes
a
reaction
of
wholesome
barbarism
in
the
rest
we
shall
fight
like
blazes
in
the
twentieth
century
it
the
only
thing
that
keeps
englishmen
sound
commercialism
is
their
curse
happily
no
sooner
do
they
get
fat
than
they
kick
and
somebody
shin
suffers
then
they
fight
off
the
excessive
flesh
war
is
england
banting
better
not
talk
like
that
to
sibyl
frankly
old
man
i
think
that
your
mistake
but
you
tell
me
and
rightly
enough
to
mind
my
own
business
what
do
you
mean
exactly
you
think
i
ought
to
hugh
hesitated
with
an
air
of
uneasiness
pursued
his
friend
cautiously
you
think
it
right
to
suppress
your
natural
instincts
might
it
give
her
a
new
interest
in
life
if
she
came
round
a
little
to
your
point
of
view
thing
how
unlike
we
are
is
it
said
carnaby
with
a
sudden
drop
of
his

a

within

struck

and
lit
a

upon

harvey
put
up

turned
the
great
key
then
went
quietly
upstairs
his
rooms
were
on
the
first
floor
a
tenancy
of
five
years
with
long
absences
enabled
him
to
regard
this
niche
in
a
characterless
suburb
as
in
some
sort
his
home
a
familiar
smell
of
books
and
tobacco
welcomed
him
as
he
opened
the

remnants
of
a
good
fire
kept
the
air
warm
and
dispersed
a
pleasant
glow
on
shelves
which
almost
concealed
the
walls
stood
a
respectable
collection
of
volumes
the
lowest
tier
consisting
largely
of
what
secondhand
booksellers
when
invited
to
purchase
are
wont
to
call
that
is
to
say
old
folios
of
no
great
market
value
though
good
brains
and
infinite
labour
went
to
the
making
of
them

great
table
at
one
end
of
which
was
a
tray
with
glasses
and
a

the

of

over

hung

of

burning
in

it
at

in

not
long

the
work
of
a
man
of
whom
he
knew
nothing
it
represented
the
farthest
point
of
his
own
travels
and
touched
profoundly
his
vague
sensibilities
three
letters
lay
on
the
desk
as
soon
as
he
had
lit
his
lamp
and
exchanged
his
boots
for

he
looked
at
the

and

a
shocking
affair
of

carnaby
i
never

anything
so
our
united
kind
regards
harvey
thrust
out
his
lips
in
an
ambiguous
expression
as
he
threw
the
sheet
aside
he
mused
before
opening
the
next
letter

to
be
of
startling
contents

can
do
no

if
the
shabby

refuse
as
i
dare
say
they
will
it
would
hurt
you
to
keep
them
from
the
workhouse
but
it
a
devilish
hard
world
and
they
must
take
their
chance
after
a
stare
and
a
frown
harvey
woke
the
echoes
with
boisterous
laughter
it
was
long
since
any
passage
in
writing
had
so
irresistibly
tickled
his
sense
of
humour
well
he
must
let
abbott
know
of
this
it
might
be
as
well
perhaps
if
he
called
on
abbott
tomorrow
to
remove
any
doubt
that
might
remain
in
her
mind
the
fellow
wager
being
an
old
acquaintance
of
his
he
could
not
get
rid
of
a
sense
of
responsibility
in
this
matter
though
happily

meeting
with
abbott

which
led
to
marriage
and
misery
came
about
quite
independently
of
him
the
last
letter
he
opened
without
curiosity
but
with
quiet
interest
and
pleasure
it
was
dated
from
greystone
the
writer
basil
morton
had
a
place
in
his
earliest
memories
for
as
neighbours
children
they
had
played
together
long
before
the
days
which
allied
him
with
hugh
carnaby
aught
i
know

at
this
moment
be
drifting
on
the
euphrates

pondering
on

it
is
you
who
owe
me
an
account

yourself
nevertheless
i
am
prompted
to
write
if
only
to
tell
you
that
i
have
just
got
the
complete
set
of
the
byzantine
historians
a
catalogue
tempted
me
and
i
did
buy
and
so
on
in
the
same
strain
until
in
speaking
of
nearer
matters
his
style
grew
simpler
elder
boy
begins
to
put
me
in
a
difficulty
as
i
told
you
he
has
been
brought
up
on
the
most
orthodox
lines
of
anglicanism
his
mother
best
of
mothers
and
best
of
wives
but
in
this
respect
atavistic
has
had
a
free
hand
and
i
do
see
how
it
could
have
been
otherwise
but
now
the
lad
begins
to
ask
awkward
questions
and
to
put
me
in
a
corner
the
young
rascal
is
a
vigorous
dialectician
and
rationalist
odd
result
of
such
training
it
becomes
a
serious
question
how
i
am
to
behave
i
can
not
bear
to
distress
his
mother
yet
how
can
i
tell
him
that
i
literally
believe
those
quaint
old
fables
of
course
like
everything
else
but
just
now
it
worries
me
a
little
generally
i
can
see
a
pretty
clear
line
of
duty
here
the
duty
is
divided
with
a
vengeance
have
you
any
counsel
harvey
rolfe
mumbled
impatiently
all
domestic
matters
were
a
trial
to
his
nerves
it
seemed
to
him
an
act
of
unaccountable
folly
to
marry
a
woman
from
whom
one
differed
diametrically
on
subjects
that
lay
at
the
root
of
life
and
of
children
he
could
hardly
bring
himself
to
think
at
all
so
exasperating
the
complication
they
introduced
into
social
problems
which
defied
he
disliked
children
fled
the
sight
and
the
sound
of
them
in
most
cases
and
when
this
was
not
possible
regarded
them
with
apprehension
anxiety
weariness
anything
but
interest
in
the
perplexity
that
had
come
upon
him
basil
morton
seemed
to
have
nothing
more
than
his
deserts
of
mothers
and
of
wives
forsooth
an
excellent
housekeeper
no
doubt
but
what
shadow
of
qualification
for
wifehood
and
motherhood
in
this
year
the
whole
question
was
disgusting
to
a
rational
man
especially
to
that
vigorous
example
of
the
class
by
name
harvey
rolfe
late
as
it
was
he
did
not
care
to
go
to
bed
this
morning
he
had
brought
home
a
batch
of
books
from
the
london
library
and
he
began
to
turn
them
over
with
the
pleasure
of
anticipation
not
seldom
of
late
had
harvey
flattered
himself
on
the
growth
of
intellectual
gusto
which
proceeded
in
him
together
with
a
perceptible
decline
of
baser
appetites
so
long
his
torment
and
his
hindrance
his
age
was
now
seven
and
thirty
at
forty
he
might
hope
to
have
utterly
trodden
under
foot
the
instincts
at
war
with
mental
calm
he
saw
before
him
long
years
of
congenial
fellowship
of
bracing
travel
of
studiousness
let
problems
of
sex
and
society
go
hang
he
had
found
a
better
way
on
looking
back
over
his
life
how
improbable
it
seemed
this
happy
issue
out
of
crudity
turbulence
lack
of
purpose
weakness
insincerity
ignorance
first
and
foremost
he
had
to
thank
good
old
dr
harvey
of
greystone
then
his
sister
sleeping
in
her
grave
under
the
old
chimes
she
loved
then
surely
himself
that
seed
of
good
within
him
which
had
survived
all
adverse
influences
watched
surely
by
his
unconscious
self
guarded
long
and
now
deliberately
nurtured
might
he
not
think
well
of
himself
his
library
though
for
the
most
part
the
purchase
of
late
years
contained
books
which
reminded
him
of
every
period
of
his
life
up
yonder
on
the
top
shelf
were
two
score
volumes
which
had
belonged
to
his
father
the
share
that
fell
to
him
when
he
and
his
sister
made
the
ordained
division
scientific
treatises
out
of
date
an
old
magazine
old
books
of
travel
strange
that
in
his
times
of
folly
he
had
not
sold
these
as
burdensome
rubbish
he
was
very
glad
now
when
love
and
reverence
for
things
gone
by
began
to
take
hold
upon
him
there
at
the
same
height
stood
a
rank
of
preserved
for
him
by
his
sister
till
she
died
beside
them
medical
works
relics
of
his
abortive
study
when
he
was
neither
boy
nor
man
descending
the
eye
fell
upon
yellow
and
green
covers
dozens
of
french
novels
acquired
at
any
time
from
the
year
of
his
majority
up
to
the
other
day
in
the
mass
they
reminded
him
of
a
frothy
season
when
he
boasted
a
cheap
gallicism
and
sneered
at
all
things
english
a
sprinkling
of
miscellaneous
literature
accounted
for
ten
years
or
more
when
he
cared
little
to
collect
books
when
the
senses
raged
in
him
and
only
by
miracle
failed
to
hurl
him
down
many
a
steep
place
last
came
the
serious
acquisitions
the
bulk
of
his
library
solid
and
expensive
works
historians
archaeologists
travellers
with
noble
volumes
of
engravings
and
unwieldy
tomes
of
antique
lore
little
enough
of
all
this
had
rolfe
digested
but
more
and
more
he
loved
to
have
erudition
within
his
reach
he
began
to
lack
room
for
comely
storage
already
a
large
bookcase
had
intruded
into
his
bedroom
if
he
continued
to
purchase
he
must
needs
house
himself
more
amply
yet
he
dreaded
the
thought
of
a
removal
he
knew
enough
and
to
spare
of
life
in
lodgings
his
experience
began
when
he
came
up
as
a
lad
to
guy
hospital
when
all
lodgings
in
london
shone
with
the
glorious
light
of
liberty
it
took
a
wider
scope
when
having
grasped
his
little
patrimony
he
threw
physic
to
the
dogs
and
lived
as
a
gentleman
at
large
in
those
days
he
grew
familiar
with
many
kinds
of
and
their
nomadic
denizens
having
wasted
his
substance
he
found
refuge
in
the
office
of
an
emigration
agent
where
by
slow
degrees
he
proved
himself
worth
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
per
annum
this
was
the
to
which
hugh
carnaby
vaguely
referred
when
people
questioned
him
concerning
his
friend
history
had
he
possessed
the
commercial
spirit
harvey
might
have
made
his
position
in
this
office
much
more
lucrative
entering
nominally
as
a
clerk
he
undertook
from
the
first
a
variety
of
duties
which
could
only
be
discharged
by
a
man
of
special
abilities
for
instance
the
literary
revision
of
seductive
pamphlets
and
broadsheets
issued
by
his
employer
to
the
public
contemplating
emigration
these
advertisements
he
presently
composed
and
from
the
point
of
view
of
effectiveness
did
it
remarkably
well
how
far
such
work
might
be
worthy
of
an
honest
man
was
another
question
which
for
several
years
scarcely
troubled
his
conscience
before
long
a
use
was
found
for
his
slender
medical
attainments
it
became
one
of
his
functions
to
answer
persons
who
visited
the
office
for
information
as
to
the
climatic
features
of
this
or
that
new
country
and
their
physical
fitness
for
going
out
as
colonists
of
course
there
was
demanded
of
him
a
radical
unscrupulousness
and
often
enough
he
proved
equal
to
the
occasion
but
as
time
went
on
bringing
slow
development
of
brain
and
character
he
found
these
personal
interviews
anything
but
agreeable
he
had
constantly
before
him
the
spectacle
of
human
misery
and
defeat
now
and
then
in
such
dread
forms
that
his
heart
sank
and
his
tongue
refused
to
lie
when
disgust
made
him
contemplate
the
possibility
of
finding
more
honourable
employment
the
manifest
difficulties
deterred
him
he
held
the
place
for
nearly
ten
years
living
in
the
end
so
soberly
and
frugally
that
his
two
hundred
pounds
seemed
a
considerable
income
it
enabled
him
to
spend
his
annual
month
of
holiday
in
continental
travel
which
now
had
a
significance
very
different
from
that
of
his
truancies
in
france
or
belgium
before
he
began
to
earn
a
livelihood
two
deaths
a
year
interval
between
them
released
him
from
his
office
upon
these
events
and
their
issue
he
had
not
counted
independence
came
to
him
as
a
great
surprise
and
on
the
path
of
he
had
far
to
travel
before
the
significance
of
that
and
many
another
grew
clear
to
his
backward
gaze
seeking
for
a
comfortable
abode
he
discovered
these
rooms
in
bayswater
they
were
to
let
furnished
the
house
being
occupied
by
a
widow
not
quite
of
the
ordinary
type
of
landlady
who
entertained
only
bachelors
and
was
fairly
conscientious
in
the
discharge
of
her
obligations
six
months
later
during
harvey
absence
abroad
this
woman
died
and
on
his
return
the
house
had
already
been
stripped
of
furniture
for
a
moment
he
inclined
to
take
a
house
of
his
own
but
from
this
perilous
experiment
he
was
saved
by
an
intimation
that
if
he
were
willing
to
supply
himself
with
furniture
and
service
an
incoming
tenant
would
let
him
occupy
his
old
quarters
harvey
grasped
at
the
offer
his
landlord
was
a
man
named
buncombe
a
truss
manufacturer
who
had
two
children
and
seemingly
no
wife
the
topmost
storey
buncombe
assigned
to
relatives
of
his
own
a
woman
handover
with
a
sickly
grownup
son
who
took
some
part
in
the
truss
business
for
a
few
weeks
rolfe
was
waited
upon
by
a
charwoman
whom
he
paid
extravagantly
for
a
maximum
of
dirt
and
discomfort
then
the
unsatisfactory
person
fell
ill
and
whilst
cursing
his
difficulties
harvey
was
surprised
by
a
visit
from
handover
who
made
an
unexpected
suggestion
would
rolfe
accept
her
services
in
lieu
of
the
charwoman
paying
her
whatever
he
had
been
accustomed
to
give
the
proposal
startled
him
handover
seemed
to
belong
pretty
much
to
his
own
rank
of
life
he
was
appalled
at
the
thought
of
bidding
her
scrub
floors
and
wash
plates
and
indeed
it
had
begun
to
dawn
upon
him
that
for
a
man
with
more
than
nine
hundred
a
year
he
was
living
in
a
needlessly
uncomfortable
way
on
his
reply
that
he
thought
of
removing
handover
fell
into
profound
depression
and
began
to
disclose
her
history
very
early
in
life
she
had
married
a
man
much
beneath
her
in
station
with
the
natural
result
after
some
years
of
quarrelling
which
culminated
in
personal
violence
on
her
husband
part
she
obtained
a
judicial
separation
for
a
long
time
the
man
had
ceased
to
send
her
money
and
indeed
he
was
become
a
vagabond
pauper
from
whom
nothing
could
be
obtained
she
depended
upon
her
son
and
on
the
kindness
of
buncombe
who
asked
no
rent
if
she
could
earn
a
little
money
by
work
she
would
be
much
happier
and
with
tremulous
hope
she
had
taken
this
step
of
appealing
to
her
neighbour
in
the
house
harvey
could
not
resist
these
representations
when
the
new
arrangement
had
been
in
operation
for
a
week
or
so
harvey
began
to
reflect
upon
handover
personal
narrative
and
in
some
respects
to
modify
his
first
impulsive
judgment
thereon
it
seemed
to
him
not
impossible
that
handover
present
condition
of
vagabond
pauper
might
be
traceable
to
his
marriage
with
a
woman
who
had
never
learnt
the
elements
of
domestic
duty
thoroughly
handover
was
the
most
incompetent
of
housewives
yet
such
was
harvey
rolfe
delicacy
and
so
intense
his
moral
cowardice
that
year
after
year
he
bore
with
handover
defects
and
paid
her
with
a
smile
the
wages
of
two
servants
dust
lay
thick
about
him
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
it
as
to
many
another
form
of
sluttishness
after
all
he
possessed
a
quiet
retreat
for
studious
hours
and
a
tolerable
with
the
advantage
of
having
his
correspondence
forwarded
to
him
when
he
chose
to
wander
to
be
sure
it
was
not
final
one
would
not
wish
to
grow
old
and
die
amid
such
surroundings
sooner
or
later
circumstance
would
prompt
the
desirable
change
circumstance
at
this
stage
of
his
career
was
harvey
god
he
waited
upon
its
direction
with
an
air
of
wisdom
of
mature
philosophy
of
his
landlord
buncombe
he
gradually
learnt
all
that
he
cared
to
know
the
moment
came
when
buncombe
grew
confidential
and
he
too
had
a
matrimonial
history
to
disclose
poverty
played
no
part
in
it
his
business
flourished
and
buncombe
throughout
a
cohabitation
of
five
years
made
no
complaint
of
her
lot
all
at
once
so
asserted
buncombe
the
lady
began
to
talk
of
dullness
for
a
few
months
she
moped
then
of
a
sudden
left
home
and
in
a
day
or
two
announced
by
letter
that
she
had
taken
a
place
as
barmaid
at
a
there
followed
an
interview
between
husband
and
wife
with
the
result
said
buncombe
that
they
parted
the
best
of
friends
but
with
an
understanding
that
buncombe
should
be
free
to
follow
her
own
walk
in
life
with
a
moderate
allowance
to
supplement
what
she
could
earn
that
was
five
years
ago
buncombe
now
sang
at
halls
and
enjoyed
a
certain
popularity
which
seemed
to
her
an
ample
justification
of
the
independence
she
had
claimed
she
was
just
thirty
tolerably
and
full
of
the
enjoyment
of
life
her
children
originally
left
in
the
care
of
her
mother
whom
buncombe
supported
were
now
looked
after
by
the
two
servants
of
the
house
and
buncombe
seemed
to
have
no
conscientious
troubles
on
that
score
to
harvey
rolfe
eye
it
was
plain
that
the
brother
and
sister
were
growing
up
as
vicious
little
savages
but
he
permitted
himself
no
remark
on
the
subject
after
a
few
conversations
he
gained
an
inkling
of
buncombe
motive
in
taking
a
house
so
much
larger
than
he
needed
this
magnificence
was
meant
as
an
attraction
to
the
roaming
wife
whom
it
was
clear
buncombe
both
wished
and
hoped
to
welcome
back
before
very
long
she
did
occasionally
visit
the
house
though
only
for
an
hour
or
two
just
to
show
said
buncombe
that
there
was
no
on
his
part
evidently
there
was
none
whatever
an
fellow
aged
about
forty
with
a
boyish
good
temper
and
no
will
to
speak
of
he
seemed
never
to
entertain
a
doubt
of
his
wife
honesty
and
in
any
case
would
probably
have
agreed
on
the
least
persuasion
to
let
bygones
be
bygones
he
spoke
rather
proudly
than
otherwise
of
buncombe
artistic
success
is
every
woman
could
have
done
it
you
know
mr
rolfe
is
not
harvey
assented
only
those
rooms
were
furnished
which
the
little
family
used
five
or
six
in
all
two
or
three
stood
vacant
and
served
as
playgrounds
for
the
children
in
bad
weather
of
his
relatives
at
the
top
buncombe
never
spoke
he
either
did
not
know
or
viewed
with
indifference
the
fact
that
handover
served
his
lodger
in
a
menial
capacity
about
once
a
month
he
invited
three
or
four
male
friends
to
a
set
dinner
and
hilarity
could
be
heard
until
long
after
midnight
altogether
it
was
a
strange
household
and
as
he
walked
about
the
streets
of
the
neighbourhood
harvey
often
wondered
what
abnormalities
even
more
striking
might
be
concealed
behind
the
meaningless
uniformity
of
these
heavily
respectable
housefronts
as
a
lodger
he
was
content
to
dwell
here
but
sometimes
by
a
freak
of
imagination
he
pictured
himself
a
married
man
imprisoned
with
wife
and
children
amid
these
leagues
of
dreary
inhospitable
brickwork
and
a
great
horror
fell
upon
him
no
in
his
time
he
had
run
through
follies
innumerable
but
from
the
supreme
folly
of
hampering
himself
by
marriage
a
merciful
fate
had
guarded
him
it
was
probably
the
most
remarkable
fact
of
his
life
it
heightened
his
and
appeared
to
warrant
him
in
the
assurance
that
a
destiny
so
protective
would
round
the
close
of
his
days
with
tranquillity
and
content
upon
this
thought
he
lay
down
to
rest
for
half
an
hour
basil
letter
had
occupied
his
mind
he
had
tried
to
think
out
the
problem
it
set
forth
not
to
leave
his
friend
quite
unanswered
but
weariness
prevailed
and
with
it
the
old
mood
of
next
morning
the
weather
was
fine
that
is
to
say
one
could
read
without
artificial
light
and
no
rain
fell
and
far
above
the
appeared
a
bluish
glimmer
shot
now
and
then
with
pale
yellowness
harvey
decided
to
carry
out
his
intention
of
calling
upon
abbott
she
lived
at
kilburn
and
thither
he
drove
shortly
before
twelve
he
was
admitted
to
a
very
cosy
room
where
amid
books
and
pictures
and
by
a
large
fire
the
lady
of
the
house
sat
reading
whatever
the
cause
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
welcome
fell
short
of
cordiality
and
he
hastened
to
excuse
himself
for
intruding
at
so
early
an
hour
received
a
letter
last
night
which
i
thought
you
had
better
know
of
without
delay
that
man
mr
wager
said
abbott
quickly
and
hopefully
her
face
brightening
but
there
nothing
satisfactory
in
it
he
writes
from
liverpool
and
merely
says
that
the
children
are
at
his
lodgings
and
he
can
do
no
more
for
them
abbott
set
her
lips
in
an
expression
almost
of
sullenness
rolfe
had
never
seen
her
look
thus
but
it
confirmed
a
suspicion
which
he
had
harboured
concerning
her
why
he
hardly
knew
for
she
always
presented
a
face
of
amiability
and
talked
in
gentle
womanly
tones
doubt
as
to
abbott
domestic
felicity
haunted
his
mind
perhaps
he
now
saw
her
for
the
first
time
as
she
commonly
appeared
to
her
husband
slightly
peevish
unwilling
to
be
disturbed
impatient
when
things
did
not
run
smoothly
saw
my
husband
yesterday
was
her
next
remark
not
very
graciously
uttered
met
in
the
street
last
night
before
i
got
wager
letter
he
was
suffering
horribly
from
neuralgia
harvey
could
not
forbear
to
add
this
detail
but
he
softened
his
voice
and
smiled
do
wonder
at
it
returned
the
lady
takes
no
care
of
himself
harvey
glanced
about
the
room
its
furnishing
might
be
called
luxurious
and
the
same
standard
of
comfort
prevailed
through
the
house
considering
that
edgar
abbott
as
rolfe
knew
married
on
small
means
and
that
he
had
toiled
unremittingly
to
support
a
home
in
which
he
could
seldom
enjoy
an
hour
leisure
there
seemed
no
difficulty
in
explaining
this
neglect
of
his
own
health
it
struck
the
visitor
that
abbott
might
have
taken
such
considerations
into
account
and
have
spoken
of
the
good
fellow
more
sympathetically
in
truth
harvey
did
not
quite
like
abbott
her
age
was
about
seven
and
twenty
she
came
of
poor
folk
and
had
been
a
teacher
very
clever
and
successful
it
was
said
and
harvey
could
believe
it
her
features
were
regular
and
did
not
lack
sweetness
yet
unless
an
observer
were
mistaken
the
last
year
or
two
had
emphasised
a
certain
air
of
conscious
superiority
perchance
originating
in
the
schoolroom
she
had
had
one
child
it
struggled
through
a
few
months
of
sickly
life
and
died
of
convulsions
during
its
mother
absence
at
a
to
all
appearances
her
grief
at
the
loss
betokened
tenderest
feeling
when
in
half
a
year
time
she
again
came
forth
into
the
world
a
change
was
noted
her
character
seemed
to
have
developed
a
new
energy
she
exhibited
wider
interests
and
stepped
from
the
background
to
become
a
leader
in
the
little
circle
of
her
acquaintances
you
read
this
asked
his
hostess
abruptly
holding
up
to
him
a
french
volume
ribot
that
kind
of
thing
does
interest
me
much
i
find
it
interesting
harvey
rose
he
was
in
no
mood
for
this
kind
of
but
no
sooner
had
he
quitted
his
chair
than
abbott
threw
her
book
aside
and
spoke
in
another
tone
seriously
though
still
with
a
perceptible
accent
of
annoyance
course
that
man
children
are
here
and
i
suppose
it
is
our
duty
to
provide
for
them
till
some
other
arrangement
is
made
but
i
think
we
ought
to
put
the
matter
in
the
hands
of
the
police
do
you
mr
rolfe
afraid
there
small
chance
of
making
their
father
support
them
he
is
certainly
out
of
england
by
now
and
wo
easily
be
caught
worst
of
it
is
they
are
anything
but
children
what
could
one
expect
with
such
a
father
since
their
poor
mother
died
they
have
been
in
the
hands
of
horrible
people
landladies
no
doubt
their
talk
shocks
me
the
last
amusement
they
had
was
to
be
taken
by
somebody
to
tussaud
and
now
they
can
talk
of
nothing
but
the
hunted
murderer
one
sees
it
on
the
walls
you
know
and
they
play
at
being
murderer
and
policeman
one
trying
to
escape
the
other
pretty
play
for
children
of
five
and
seven
is
it
rolfe
made
a
gesture
of
disgust
know
the
poor
things
ca
help
it
pursued
abbott
with
softer
feeling
it
turns
me
against
them
from
seeing
so
little
of
their
father
they
have
even
come
to
talk
with
a
vulgar
pronunciation
like
children
out
of
the
streets
almost
it
dreadful
when
i
think
of
my
cousin
such
a
sweet
good
girl
and
her
children
oh
horrible
are
very
young
said
harvey
in
a
low
voice
perturbed
in
spite
of
himself
good
training
of
course
we
must
put
them
in
good
hands
somewhere
plainly
it
had
never
occurred
to
abbott
that
such
a
task
as
this
might
even
temporarily
be
undertaken
by
herself
her
one
desire
was
to
get
rid
of
the
luckless
brats
that
their
vulgarity
might
not
pain
her
and
the
care
of
them
encumber
her
polite
leisure
after
again
excusing
himself
for
this
call
and
hearing
his
apology
this
time
more
graciously
received
harvey
withdrew
from
the
cosy
study
and
left
abbott
to
her
on
his
way
to
lunch
in
town
he
thought
of
the
overworn
journalist
groaning
with
neuralgia
and
wondered
how
abbott
would
relish
a
removal
to
the
town
of
waterbury
chapter
uncertain
to
the
last
moment
harvey
did
at
length
hurry
into
his
dress
clothes
and
start
for
fitzjohn
avenue
he
had
little
mind
for
the
crowd
and
the
amateur
music
but
he
could
not
answer
bennet
frothingham
with
any
valid
excuse
and
after
all
she
meant
kindly
towards
him
why
he
enjoyed
so
much
of
this
lady
favour
it
was
not
easy
to
understand
intellectual
sympathy
there
could
be
none
between
them
and
as
for
personal
liking
on
his
side
it
did
not
go
beyond
that
naturally
excited
by
a
rather
pretty
woman
whose
sprightliness
never
passed
the
limits
of
decorum
and
who
seemed
to
have
better
qualities
than
found
scope
in
her
butterfly
existence
perhaps
he
amused
her
being
so
unlike
the
kind
of
man
she
was
accustomed
to
see
his
acquaintance
with
the
family
dated
from
their
social
palingenesis
when
after
obscure
prosperity
in
a
southern
suburb
they
fluttered
to
the
northern
heights
and
were
observed
of
the
paragraphists
long
before
that
bennet
frothingham
had
been
known
in
the
it
was
the
loan
assurance
investment
and
banking
company
limited
that
made
him
nationally
prominent
and
gave
an
opportunity
to
his
wife
in
second
marriage
and
his
daughter
by
the
first
three
years
ago
when
carnaby
already
lured
by
the
charms
of
sibyl
larkfield
presented
his
friend
rolfe
as
man
who
had
been
to
bagdad
alma
frothingham
not
quite
was
studying
at
the
royal
academy
of
music
and
according
to
her
friends
promised
to
excel
alike
on
the
piano
and
the
violin
having
at
the
same
time
a
remarkable
contralto
voice
of
late
the
young
lady
had
abandoned
singing
rarely
used
the
pianoforte
and
seemed
satisfied
to
achieve
distinction
as
a
violinist
she
had
founded
an
amateur
quartet
society
whose
performances
were
frequently
to
be
heard
at
the
house
in
fitzjohn
avenue
last
winter
harvey
had
chanced
to
meet
alma
and
her
stepmother
at
leipzig
at
a
gewandhaus
concert
he
was
invited
to
go
with
them
to
hear
the
boys
motet
at
the
thomaskirche
and
with
this
intercourse
began
the
change
in
their
relations
from
mere
acquaintance
to
something
like
friendship
through
the
following
spring
rolfe
was
a
familiar
figure
at
the
frothinghams
but
this
form
of
pleasure
soon
wearied
him
and
he
was
glad
to
escape
from
london
in
june
he
knew
the
shadowy
and
intermittent
temptation
which
beckoned
him
to
that
house
music
had
power
over
him
and
he
grew
conscious
of
watching
alma
frothingham
her
white
little
chin
on
the
brown
fiddle
with
too
exclusive
an
interest
when
fellow
cyrus
redgrave
a
millionaire
or
something
of
the
sort
began
to
attend
these
gatherings
with
a
like
assiduity
and
to
win
more
than
his
share
of
miss
frothingham
conversation
harvey
felt
a
disquietude
which
happily
took
the
form
of
disgust
and
it
was
easy
enough
to
pack
his
portmanteau
through
the
babble
of
many
voices
in
many
keys
talk
mingling
with
laughter
more
or
less
melodiously
subdued
he
made
his
way
up
the
great
staircase
as
he
neared
the
landing
there
sounded
the
shrill
squeak
of
a
violin
and
a
deep
harmonic
growl
his
hostess
small
slender
fair
and
not
yet
forty
a
upon
her
throat
and
in
the
tiara
above
her
smooth
low
forehead
took
a
step
forward
to
greet
him
how
delightful
i
shot
at
a
venture
and
it
was
a
hit
after
all
are
just
beginning
quartet
yes
herr
wilenski
has
promised
to
play
afterwards
he
moved
on
crossed
a
small
entered
the
larger
room
sacred
to
music
and
reached
a
seat
in
the
nick
of
time
miss
frothingham
the
violin
against
her
shoulder
was
casting
a
final
glance
at
the
assembly
the
glance
which
could
convey
a
noble
severity
when
it
did
not
forthwith
impose
silence
a
moment
perfect
stillness
and
the
quartet
began
there
were
two
ladies
two
men
miss
frothingham
played
the
first
violin
aeneas
piper
the
second
the
was
in
the
hands
of
herr
gassner
and
the
viola
yielded
its
tones
to
miss
dora
leach
harvey
knew
them
all
but
had
eyes
only
for
one
in
truth
only
one
rewarded
observation
miss
leach
was
a
meagre
blonde
whose
form
face
and
attitude
enhanced
by
contrast
the
graces
of
the
first
violin
alma
countenance
shone
possibly
with
the
joy
of
the
artist
perhaps
only
with
gratified
vanity
as
she
grew
warm
the
rosy
blood
mantled
in
her
cheeks
and
flushed
her
neck
every
muscle
and
nerve
tense
as
the
strings
from
which
she
struck
music
she
presently
swayed
forward
on
the
points
of
her
feet
and
seemed
to
gain
in
stature
to
become
a
more
commanding
type
her
features
suggested
neither
force
of
intellect
or
originality
of
character
but
they
had
beauty
and
something
more
she
stood
a
fascination
an
allurement
to
the
masculine
sense
harvey
rolfe
had
never
so
responded
to
this
quality
in
the
girl
the
smile
died
from
his
face
as
he
regarded
her
of
her
skill
as
a
musician
he
could
form
no
judgment
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
played
very
well
and
he
had
heard
her
praised
by
people
who
understood
the
matter
for
instance
herr
wilenski
the
virtuoso
from
whom
in
itself
a
great
compliment
alma
was
having
lessons
he
averted
his
eyes
and
began
to
seek
for
known
faces
among
the
audience
his
host
he
could
not
discover
frothingham
must
be
away
from
home
this
evening
it
was
seldom
he
failed
to
attend
concerts
but
near
the
front
sat
ascott
larkfield
a
dazzling
figure
and
at
some
distance
her
daughter
carnaby
no
shadow
of
gloom
upon
her
handsome
features
hugh
was
not
in
sight
probably
he
felt
in
no
mood
for
parties
next
to
carnaby
sat
fellow
cyrus
redgrave
smiling
as
always
and
surveying
the
people
near
him
from
under
drooping
brows
his
head
slightly
bent
redgrave
had
thin
hair
but
a
robust
moustache
and
a
short
peaked
beard
his
complexion
was
a
rifle
sallow
he
lolled
upon
the
chair
so
that
at
moments
his
head
all
but
brushed
carnaby
shoulder
long
before
the
close
of
the
piece
rolfe
had
ceased
to
listen
his
thoughts
drifting
hither
and
hither
on
a
turbid
flood
of
emotion
during
the
last
passage
molto
he
felt
a
movement
round
about
him
as
a
general
relief
and
when
on
the
last
note
there
broke
forth
familiar
ambiguity
sounds
of
pleasure
and
of
applause
he
at
once
stood
up
but
he
had
no
intention
of
pressing
into
the
throng
that
rapidly
surrounded
the
musicians
seeing
that
redgrave
had
vacated
his
place
whilst
carnaby
remained
seated
he
stepped
forward
to
speak
with
his
friend
wife
she
smiled
up
at
him
and
lifted
a
gloved
finger
please
do
sit
down
by
you
certainly
but
i
saw
condolence
in
your
face
and
i
tired
of
it
besides
it
would
be
mere
hypocrisy
in
you
harvey
gave
a
silent
laugh
he
had
tried
to
understand
sibyl
carnaby
and
at
different
times
had
come
to
very
different
conclusions
regarding
her
all
women
puzzled
and
often
disconcerted
him
with
sibyl
he
could
never
talk
freely
knowing
not
whether
to
dislike
or
to
admire
her
he
was
not
made
on
the
pattern
of
cyrus
redgrave
who
probably
viewed
womankind
with
instinctive
contempt
yet
pleased
all
with
the
flattery
of
his
homage
then
we
wo
talk
of
it
he
said
noticing
in
the
same
moment
that
her
person
did
not
lack
the
adornment
of
jewels
perhaps
she
had
happened
to
be
wearing
these
things
on
the
evening
of
the
robbery
but
rolfe
felt
a
conviction
that
under
any
circumstances
sibyl
would
not
be
without
rings
and
bracelets
certainly
improve
she
remarked
indicating
the
quartet
with
the
tip
of
her
fan
her
opinions
were
uttered
with
calm
assurance
whatever
the
subject
an
infinite
so
placid
that
it
never
suggested
the
vulgarity
of
conceit
shone
in
her
large
eyes
and
dwelt
upon
the
beautiful
curve
of
her
lips
no
face
could
be
of
purer
outline
of
less
sensual
suggestiveness
it
wore
at
times
an
air
of
cold
abstraction
which
was
all
but
austerity
rolfe
imagined
her
the
most
selfish
of
women
thought
her
incapable
of
sentiment
yet
how
was
her
marriage
to
be
accounted
for
save
by
supposing
that
she
fell
in
love
with
hugh
carnaby
such
a
woman
might
surely
have
sold
herself
to
great
advantage
and
yet
odd
incongruity
she
did
not
impress
one
as
socially
ambitious
her
mother
the
widow
sped
from
assembly
to
assembly
unable
to
live
save
in
the
whirl
of
fashion
not
so
sibyl
was
she
too
proud
too
and
what
ambition
did
she
nourish
or
was
it
all
an
illusion
of
the
senses
suppose
her
a
mere
graven
image
hollow
void
call
her
merely
a
handsome
woman
with
the
face
of
some
remarkable
ancestress
with
just
enough
of
warmth
to
be
subdued
by
the
vigorous
passion
of
such
a
fine
fellow
as
carnaby
on
the
whole
rolfe
preferred
this
hypothesis
he
had
never
heard
her
say
anything
really
bright
or
witty
or
significant
but
hugh
spoke
of
her
fine
qualities
of
head
and
heart
alma
frothingham
made
her
an
exemplar
and
would
not
one
woman
see
through
the
vacuous
pretentiousness
of
another
involuntarily
he
was
gazing
at
her
trying
to
read
her
face
you
think
we
ought
to
go
to
australia
said
sibyl
quietly
returning
his
look
hugh
had
repeated
the
conversation
of
last
night
indiscreet
but
natural
one
could
not
suppose
that
hugh
kept
many
secrets
from
his
wife
he
was
confused
we
were
talking
about
the
miseries
of
housekeeping
hate
the
name
of
those
new
countries
it
was
said
smilingly
but
with
what
expression
in
the
word
cuttings
from
the
old
tree
said
rolfe
is
future
so
at
present
they
are
barbarous
and
i
have
a
decided
preference
for
civilisation
so
have
you
i
am
quite
sure
rolfe
murmured
his
assent
whereupon
sibyl
rose
just
bent
her
head
to
him
and
moved
with
graceful
indolence
away
she
hates
harvey
said
in
his
mind
much
i
care
as
a
matter
of
courtesy
he
thought
it
well
to
move
in
miss
frothingham
direction
the
crowd
was
thinning
without
difficulty
he
approached
to
within
a
few
yards
of
her
and
there
exchanged
a
word
or
two
with
the
player
of
the
viola
miss
leach
a
good
ingenuous
creature
he
had
always
thought
dangerous
to
no
man
peace
but
rather
sentimental
and
on
that
account
to
be
avoided
whilst
talking
he
heard
a
man
voice
behind
him
pretentious
coarse
laying
down
the
law
in
a
musical
discussion
no
beethoven
is
not
his
thoughts
ate
symphonic
they
need
the
orchestra
a
string
quartet
is
to
a
symphony
what
a
delicate
is
to
an
oh
i
do
care
for
his
playing
at
all
he
has
not
what
shall
i
call
it
rolfe
turned
at
length
to
look
a
glance
showed
him
a
tall
bony
young
man
with
a
great
deal
of
disorderly
hair
and
shaven
face
sensual
utterly
lacking
refinement
he
inquired
of
miss
leach
who
this
might
be
and
learnt
that
the
man
name
was
felix
dymes
he
a
humbug
the
young
lady
was
pained
and
shocked
he
is
very
clever
she
whispered
has
composed
a
most
beautiful
song
do
you
know
it
margot
it
very
likely
that
topham
may
sing
it
at
one
of
the
ballad
concerts
i
offended
said
rolfe
to
himself
matter
seeing
his
opportunity
he
took
a
few
steps
and
stood
before
alma
frothingham
she
received
him
very
graciously
looking
him
straight
in
the
face
with
that
amused
smile
which
he
could
never
interpret
did
it
mean
that
she
thought
him
fun
had
she
discussed
him
with
sibyl
carnaby
and
heard
things
of
him
that
moved
her
mirth
or
was
it
pure
good
nature
the
overflowing
spirits
of
a
vivacious
girl
good
of
you
to
come
rolfe
and
what
did
you
think
of
us
this
was
characteristic
alma
delighted
in
praise
and
never
hesitated
to
ask
for
it
she
hung
eagerly
upon
his
unready
words
only
show
my
ignorance
when
i
talk
of
music
of
course
i
liked
it
then
you
did
think
it
very
good
i
see
i
only
my
opinion
is
worthless
alma
looked
at
him
seemed
to
hesitate
laughed
and
harvey
felt
the
conviction
that
by
absurd
sincerity
he
had
damaged
himself
in
the
girl
eyes
what
did
it
matter
been
practising
five
hours
a
day
said
alma
in
rapid
ardent
tones
her
voice
was
as
pleasant
to
the
ear
as
her
face
to
look
upon
richly
feminine
a
call
to
the
emotions
is
bad
is
it
energy
music
is
my
religion
you
know
i
often
feel
sorry
i
have
to
get
my
living
by
it
it
rather
wretched
to
be
only
an
amateur
you
think
should
be
marketable
joked
harvey
but
you
know
what
i
mean
you
are
so
critical
rolfe
i
a
good
mind
to
ask
father
to
turn
me
out
of
house
and
home
with
just
then
i
might
really
do
something
it
would
be
splendid
oh
what
do
you
think
of
that
shameful
affair
in
hamilton
terrace
mrs
carnaby
takes
it
like
an
angel
they
going
to
give
up
housekeeping
very
sensible
i
say
everybody
will
do
it
before
long
why
should
we
be
plagued
with
private
houses
are
difficulties
course
there
are
and
men
seem
to
enjoy
pointing
them
out
they
think
it
a
crime
if
women
hate
the
bother
and
misery
of
housekeeping
am
not
so
conservative
he
tried
to
meet
her
eyes
which
were
gleaming
fixedly
upon
him
but
his
look
fell
and
turned
as
quickly
from
the
wonderful
white
shoulders
the
throbbing
throat
the
neck
that
showed
its
colour
against
to
his
profound
annoyance
someone
intervened
a
lady
bringing
someone
else
to
be
introduced
rolfe
turned
on
his
heel
and
was
face
to
face
with
cyrus
redgrave
nothing
could
be
suaver
or
more
civil
than
redgrave
accost
he
spoke
like
a
polished
gentleman
and
for
aught
harvey
knew
did
not
misrepresent
himself
but
rolfe
had
a
prejudice
he
said
as
little
as
possible
and
moved
on
in
the
smaller
he
presently
conversed
with
his
hostess
frothingham
sanguine
and
buoyant
temper
seemed
proof
against
fatigue
at
home
or
as
a
guest
she
wore
the
same
look
of
enjoyment
vexations
rivalries
responsibilities
left
no
trace
upon
her
beaming
countenance
her
affections
were
numberless
her
ignorance
as
an
observer
easily
discovered
was
vast
and
profound
but
the
desire
to
please
the
tact
of
a
and
thorough
goodness
of
heart
appeared
in
all
her
sayings
and
doings
she
was
never
offensive
never
wholly
ridiculous
flowed
from
her
with
astonishing
volubility
tone
and
subject
dictated
by
the
characteristics
of
the
person
with
whom
she
gossiped
yet
her
preference
was
for
talk
on
homely
topics
reminiscences
of
a
time
when
she
knew
not
luxury
may
not
believe
it
she
said
to
him
in
a
moment
of
confidence
i
assure
you
i
am
a
very
good
cook
rolfe
did
not
quite
credit
the
assurance
but
he
felt
it
not
improbable
that
frothingham
would
accept
a
reverse
of
fortune
with
much
practical
philosophy
he
could
imagine
her
brightening
a
small
house
with
the
sweetness
of
her
disposition
and
falling
to
humble
duties
with
sprightly
goodwill
in
this
point
she
was
a
noteworthy
exception
among
the
prosperous
women
of
his
acquaintance
what
have
you
been
doing
she
asked
not
as
a
mere
phrase
of
civility
but
in
a
voice
and
which
a
look
of
genuine
interest
my
time
for
the
most
part
you
always
say
but
it
ca
be
true
i
know
the
kind
of
man
who
wastes
his
time
and
you
not
a
bit
like
him
nothing
would
gratify
my
curiosity
more
than
to
be
able
to
watch
you
through
a
whole
day
what
did
you
think
of
the
quartet
sure
they
would
make
wonderful
progress
and
alma
does
work
so
hard
i
only
afraid
she
may
injure
her
health
see
no
sign
of
it
yet
certainly
looking
very
well
said
frothingham
with
manifest
pride
and
affection
of
alma
she
always
spoke
thus
nothing
of
the
was
ever
observable
frothingham
is
not
here
this
evening
really
do
know
why
replied
the
hostess
casting
her
eyes
round
the
room
quite
expected
him
but
he
has
been
dreadfully
busy
the
last
few
weeks
and
people
do
worry
him
so
somebody
called
whilst
we
were
at
dinner
and
refused
to
believe
that
frothingham
was
not
at
home
and
made
quite
a
disturbance
at
the
door
so
they
told
me
afterwards
i
really
quite
nervous
sometimes
crazy
people
are
always
wanting
to
see
him
people
who
really
ought
not
to
be
at
large
no
doubt
they
have
had
their
troubles
poor
things
and
everybody
thinks
my
husband
can
make
them
rich
if
only
he
chooses
a
stout
man
paused
before
frothingham
and
spoke
familiarly
looking
for
has
he
put
in
an
appearance
yet
really
hope
he
enjoying
himself
somewhere
else
replied
the
hostess
rising
with
a
laugh
leave
him
no
peace
the
stout
man
did
not
smile
but
looked
gravely
for
a
moment
at
rolfe
a
stranger
to
him
and
turned
away
herr
wilenski
the
virtuoso
was
about
to
play
something
the
guests
moved
to
seat
themselves
rolfe
however
preferred
to
remain
in
this
room
where
he
could
hear
the
music
sufficiently
well
he
had
not
quite
recovered
from
his
chagrin
at
the
interruption
of
his
talk
with
alma
a
foolishness
which
made
him
impatient
with
himself
at
the
same
time
he
kept
thinking
of
the
people
of
whom
frothingham
spoke
so
lightly
a
man
such
as
bennet
frothingham
must
become
familiar
with
many
forms
of
must
himself
be
responsible
for
a
good
deal
of
folly
such
as
leads
to
downright
aberration
recalling
frothingham
innocent
curiosity
concerning
his
own
life
harvey
wished
in
turn
that
it
were
possible
for
him
to
watch
and
comprehend
the
business
of
a
great
through
one
whole
day
what
monstrous
cruelties
and
mendacities
might
underlie
the
surface
of
this
gay
and
melodious
existence
why
was
the
stout
man
looking
for
why
did
he
turn
away
with
such
a
set
countenance
why
was
that
old
bore
at
the
club
in
such
a
fidget
about
the
ha
there
indeed
sounded
the
violin
it
needed
no
technical
intelligence
to
distinguish
between
the
playing
of
wilenski
and
that
of
alma
frothingham
her
religion
forsooth
herr
wilenski
one
might
be
sure
talked
little
enough
about
his
what
did
alma
think
as
she
listened
was
she
overcome
by
the
despair
of
the
struggling
in
its
immaturity
or
did
she
smile
as
ever
and
congratulate
herself
on
the
five
hours
a
day
and
tell
herself
how
soon
she
would
reach
perfection
if
there
were
real
necessity
for
it
hopeless
to
comprehend
a
woman
the
senses
warred
upon
the
wit
seized
by
calenture
one
saw
through
radiant
mists
he
did
not
like
the
name
it
had
a
theatrical
sound
a
suggestion
of
unreality
the
knew
his
audience
he
played
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
the
babble
of
tongues
began
again
rolfe
sauntering
before
the
admirable
pictures
which
hung
here
as
a
mere
symbol
of
wealth
heard
a
voice
at
his
shoulder
very
thirsty
will
you
take
me
down
his
heart
leapt
with
pleasure
alma
must
have
seen
it
in
his
eyes
as
he
turned
did
wilenski
play
he
asked
confusedly
as
they
moved
towards
the
staircase
of
grieg
wilbraham
is
going
to
sing
wie
bist
du
meine
koniginn
brahms
you
know
but
you
do
really
care
for
music
an
astounding
accusation
do
really
care
for
it
i
known
that
since
we
were
at
leipzig
have
never
pretended
to
appreciate
music
as
you
do
that
needs
education
and
something
more
some
music
wearies
me
there
no
denying
it
like
the
melody
in
f
i
do
alma
laughed
with
superiority
but
not
i
think
it
detestable
but
of
course
that
does
matter
when
i
talk
about
books
you
think
me
a
that
word
used
to
amuse
me
so
when
i
was
a
child
i
remember
laughing
wildly
whenever
i
saw
or
heard
it
it
a
funny
word
is
it
last
i
should
apply
to
you
said
rolfe
in
an
absent
undertone
as
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
white
teeth
between
her
laughing
lips
they
entered
the
where
as
yet
only
a
few
people
were
refreshing
themselves
provisions
for
a
regiment
spread
before
the
gaze
delicacies
innumerable
invited
the
palate
this
house
was
famed
for
its
hospitable
abundance
alma
having
asked
her
companion
to
get
her
some
lemonade
talked
awhile
with
two
ladies
who
had
begun
to
eat
and
drink
in
a
serious
spirit
waiting
for
her
rolfe
swallowed
two
glasses
of
wine
to
counteract
a
certain
dullness
and
literalness
which
were
wont
to
possess
him
in
such
company
wo
sit
down
she
said
thanks
nothing
to
eat
i
wonder
where
papa
is
now
enjoys
music
though
he
is
no
musician
i
think
papa
a
wonderful
man
for
years
he
has
never
had
more
than
six
hours
sleep
and
the
work
he
does
he
take
a
holiday
idleness
makes
him
we
were
down
in
hampshire
in
july
with
some
relatives
of
mamma
the
quietest
sleepiest
village
and
papa
tried
to
spend
a
few
days
with
us
but
he
had
to
take
to
flight
he
would
have
perished
of
ennui
at
high
pressure
remarked
rolfe
as
the
least
offensive
comment
he
could
make
and
is
it
better
than
life
at
low
exclaimed
the
girl
with
animation
people
go
through
existence
without
once
exerting
all
the
powers
that
are
in
them
i
should
hate
to
die
with
the
thought
that
i
had
really
lived
myself
a
year
ago
papa
took
me
into
the
city
to
see
the
offices
of
and
just
after
the
paper
started
it
did
interest
me
very
much
but
i
pretended
it
did
because
papa
always
takes
an
interest
in
affairs
but
i
found
there
was
something
else
after
we
had
seen
the
printing
machinery
and
so
on
he
took
me
up
to
the
top
of
the
building
into
a
small
room
where
there
was
just
a
table
and
a
chair
and
a
bookshelf
and
he
told
me
it
was
his
first
office
the
room
in
which
he
had
begun
business
thirty
years
ago
he
has
always
kept
it
for
his
own
and
just
as
it
was
a
fancy
of
his
there
no
harm
in
my
telling
you
he
very
proud
of
it
and
so
am
i
that
energy
interesting
indeed
must
go
up
again
she
added
quickly
there
miss
beaufoy
do
let
me
introduce
you
to
miss
beaufoy
she
did
so
unaware
of
rolfe
groaning
reluctance
and
at
once
disappeared
the
began
to
fill
as
soon
as
he
could
escape
from
miss
beaufoy
who
had
a
cavalier
of
her
own
harvey
ascended
the
stairs
again
and
found
a
quiet
corner
where
he
sat
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
undisturbed
couples
and
groups
paused
to
talk
near
him
and
whenever
he
caught
a
sentence
it
was
the
merest
chatter
meaningless
repetition
of
commonplaces
which
but
for
habit
must
have
been
an
unutterable
weariness
to
the
least
intelligent
of
mortals
he
was
resolved
never
to
come
here
again
never
again
to
upset
his
peace
of
mind
and
sully
his
by
grimacing
amid
such
a
crowd
he
enjoyed
human
fellowship
timely
but
to
throng
one
house
with
people
for
whom
with
one
or
two
exceptions
one
cared
not
a
snap
of
the
fingers
what
was
this
but
sheer
vulgarism
as
for
alma
frothingham
long
ago
he
had
made
up
his
mind
about
her
naturally
inevitably
she
absorbed
the
vulgarity
of
her
atmosphere
all
she
did
was
for
effect
it
was
her
cue
to
pose
as
the
artist
she
would
keep
it
up
through
life
and
breathe
her
last
amid
perfumes
declaring
that
she
had
herself
out
in
his
peevishness
he
noticed
that
women
came
up
from
supper
with
flushed
cheeks
and
eyes
unnaturally
lustrous
what
a
grossly
sensual
life
was
masked
by
their
airs
and
graces
he
had
half
a
mind
to
start
tomorrow
for
the
syrian
deserts
let
us
see
you
again
soon
said
his
hostess
as
he
took
leave
of
her
in
at
five
on
wednesday
that
our
quiet
day
only
a
few
of
our
friends
we
shall
be
in
town
till
christmas
for
certain
on
the
stairs
he
passed
felix
dymes
the
composer
of
it
the
easiest
thing
in
the
world
dymes
was
saying
compose
a
song
that
will
be
popular
i
give
you
the
recipe
and
charge
nothing
you
must
have
a
sudden
change
to
the
minor
and
a
waltz
refrain
that
all
oh
yes
there
money
in
it
i
know
a
man
who
rolfe
had
never
left
the
house
in
such
a
bad
temper
chapter
when
he
awoke
next
morning
the
weather
was
so
gloomy
that
he
seriously
resumed
his
thought
of
getting
away
from
london
why
indeed
did
he
make
london
his
home
when
it
would
be
easy
to
live
in
places
vastly
more
interesting
and
under
a
pure
sky
he
was
a
citizen
of
no
city
at
all
and
had
less
desire
than
ever
to
bind
himself
to
a
permanent
habitation
all
very
well
so
long
as
he
kept
among
his
male
friends
at
the
club
and
elsewhere
but
this
played
the
deuce
with
him
and
he
had
not
the
the
force
of
resolve
to
keep
out
of
it
altogether
well
he
must
go
to
his
bank
this
morning
to
draw
cash
it
was
about
twelve
when
he
stood
at
the
counter
waiting
with
his
cheque
the
man
before
him
talked
with
the
teller
you
know
that
the
britannia
has
shut
up
bank
no
it
has
i
passed
just
now
and
there
were
a
lot
of
people
standing
about
closed
at
eleven
they
say
harvey
had
a
singular
sensation
a
tremor
at
his
heart
a
flutter
of
the
pulses
a
turning
cold
and
hot
then
he
was
quite
calm
again
and
said
to
himself
course
for
a
minute
or
two
the
quiet
routine
of
the
bank
was
suspended
the
news
passed
from
mouth
to
mouth
newcomers
swelled
a
gossiping
group
in
front
of
the
counter
and
harvey
listened
the
general
tone
was
cynical
there
sounded
scarcely
a
note
of
indignation
no
one
present
seemed
to
be
personally
affected
by
the
disaster
the
name
of
bennet
frothingham
was
frequently
pronounced
with
unflattering
comments
get
it
hot
remarked
one
of
the
speakers
and
the
others
laughed
rolfe
having
transacted
his
business
walked
away
it
struck
him
that
he
would
go
and
look
at
the
closed
bank
but
he
did
not
remember
the
address
a
policeman
directed
him
and
he
walked
on
the
distance
not
being
very
great
at
the
end
of
the
street
in
which
the
building
stood
signs
of
the
unusual
became
observable
the
outskirts
of
a
crowd
hanging
loose
in
animated
talk
as
after
some
exciting
occurrence
and
before
the
bank
itself
was
gathered
a
throng
of
men
silk
hats
mingling
with
the
felts
and
caps
of
lower
strata
here
and
there
a
voice
could
be
heard
raised
in
anger
but
the
prevailing
emotion
seemed
to
be
mere
curiosity
the
people
who
would
suffer
most
from
the
collapse
of
this
enterprise
could
not
reach
the
scene
of
calamity
at
half
an
hour
notice
they
were
dwellers
in
many
parts
of
the
british
isles
strangers
most
of
them
to
london
city
with
but
a
vague
mental
picture
of
the
local
habitation
of
the
britannia
loan
assurance
investment
and
banking
company
limited
his
arm
was
seized
and
a
voice
said
hoarsely
in
his
ear
god
too
late
hugh
carnaby
had
tumbled
out
of
a
cab
and
saw
his
friend
in
the
same
moment
that
he
got
near
enough
to
perceive
that
the
doors
of
the
bank
were
shut
thieves
have
lost
no
time
he
added
pale
with
fury
had
warning
of
it
hugh
pulled
him
a
few
yards
away
and
whispered
frothingham
shot
himself
last
night
again
harvey
experienced
that
disagreeable
with
the
alternation
of
hot
and
cold
at
home
the
office
of
and
come
farther
away
it
be
in
the
evening
papers
directly
but
i
do
want
those
blackguards
to
hear
me
i
got
up
late
this
morning
and
as
i
was
having
breakfast
sibyl
rushed
in
she
brought
the
news
had
it
from
some
friend
of
her
mother
a
man
connected
somehow
with
and
i
thought
they
would
shut
up
shop
and
came
to
try
and
save
sibyl
balance
a
couple
of
hundred
that
all
but
they
swallowed
it
with
the
rest
the
rest
hugh
laughed
mockingly
hers
devilish
bad
luck
sibyl
has
it
was
just
a
that
a
good
deal
of
my
own
was
in
one
way
or
another
you
know
any
more
about
frothingham
only
the
fact
do
know
when
it
was
or
when
it
got
known
we
shall
have
it
from
the
papers
presently
i
think
every
penny
mrs
larkfield
had
was
in
it
may
not
mean
absolute
ruin
urged
harvey
know
what
to
think
when
commits
suicide
we
shall
hear
that
some
of
the
others
have
bolted
it
be
as
clean
a
sweep
as
our
housekeeper
little
job
had
queer
presentiments
harvey
murmured
damn
it
so
have
i
so
had
lots
of
people
but
nobody
ever
does
anything
till
it
too
late
i
must
get
home
again
with
my
agreeable
news
you
be
going
to
the
club
i
dare
say
they
have
plenty
to
talk
about
for
the
next
month
or
two
to
come
round
tonight
to
my
place
it
depends
on
fifty
chances
there
only
one
thing
i
know
for
certain
that
i
shall
get
out
of
this
cursed
country
as
soon
as
possible
they
parted
and
harvey
walked
westward
he
had
no
reason
for
hurry
as
usual
the
tumult
of
the
world
business
passed
him
by
he
was
merely
a
it
occurred
to
him
that
it
might
be
a
refreshing
and
a
salutary
change
if
for
once
he
found
himself
involved
in
the
anxieties
to
which
other
men
were
subject
this
long
exemption
and
security
fostered
a
too
exclusive
regard
of
self
an
inaptitude
for
sympathetic
emotion
which
he
recognised
as
the
defect
of
his
character
this
morning
events
had
startled
him
and
given
a
shock
to
his
imagination
but
already
he
viewed
them
and
their
consequences
with
a
which
differed
little
from
unconcern
bennet
frothingham
no
doubt
had
played
a
rascally
game
foreseeing
all
along
the
issues
of
defeat
as
to
his
wife
and
daughter
it
would
be
strange
if
they
were
not
provided
for
suffer
who
might
they
would
probably
live
on
in
material
comfort
and
nowadays
that
was
the
first
consideration
he
was
surprised
that
their
calamity
left
him
so
unmoved
it
showed
conclusively
how
artificial
were
his
relations
with
these
persons
in
no
sense
did
he
belong
to
their
world
for
all
his
foolish
flutterings
alma
frothingham
remained
a
stranger
to
him
alien
from
every
point
of
view
personal
intellectual
social
and
how
many
of
the
people
who
crowded
to
her
concert
last
night
would
hear
the
news
this
morning
with
genuine
distress
on
her
account
gratified
envy
would
be
the
prevailing
mood
with
rancorous
hostility
in
the
minds
of
those
who
were
losers
by
bennet
frothingham
knavery
or
hugh
carnaby
position
called
for
no
lament
he
had
a
sufficient
income
of
his
own
and
would
now
easily
overcome
his
wife
pernicious
influence
with
or
without
her
he
would
break
away
from
a
life
of
corrupting
indolence
and
somewhere
beyond
seas
the
british
drum
use
his
superabundant
vitality
as
nature
prompted
after
all
it
promised
to
clear
the
air
these
explosions
were
periodic
inevitable
wholesome
the
britannia
loan
c
c
c
had
run
its
pestilent
course
exciting
avarice
perturbing
quiet
industry
with
the
passion
of
the
gamester
inflating
vulgar
ambition
now
at
length
scattering
wreck
and
ruin
this
is
how
mankind
progresses
harvey
rolfe
felt
glad
that
no
theological
or
scientific
dogma
constrained
him
to
a
justification
of
the
laws
of
life
at
lunchtime
newspaper
boys
began
to
yell
the
earliest
placards
roared
in
immense
typography
in
the
metropolitan
club
sheets
moist
from
the
press
suddenly
descended
like
a
fall
of
snow
rolfe
stood
by
a
window
and
read
quietly
this
first
report
told
him
little
that
he
had
not
already
learnt
but
there
were
a
few
details
of
the
suicide
frothingham
it
appeared
always
visited
the
office
of
and
on
the
day
before
publication
yesterday
as
usual
he
had
looked
in
for
half
an
hour
at
three
but
unexpectedly
he
came
again
at
seven
in
the
evening
and
for
a
third
time
at
about
eleven
when
the
printing
of
the
paper
was
in
full
swing
was
supposed
by
the
persons
whom
he
then
saw
that
frothingham
finally
quitted
the
office
whether
he
actually
left
the
building
or
not
seems
to
remain
uncertain
if
so
he
without
being
observed
which
does
not
seem
likely
between
two
and
three
this
morning
when
and
was
practically
ready
for
distribution
a
man
employed
on
the
premises
is
said
for
some
unexplained
reason
to
have
ascended
to
the
top
floor
of
the
building
and
to
have
entered
a
room
ordinarily
unused
a
was
burning
and
the
man
was
horrified
to
discover
the
dead
body
of
frothingham
at
full
length
on
the
floor
in
his
hand
a
pistol
on
the
alarm
being
given
medical
aid
was
at
once
summoned
and
it
became
evident
that
death
had
taken
place
more
than
an
hour
previously
that
no
one
heard
the
report
of
a
pistol
can
be
easily
explained
by
the
noise
of
the
machinery
below
the
dead
man
face
was
placid
very
little
blood
had
issued
from
the
wound
and
the
shot
must
have
been
fired
with
a
remarkably
steady
hand
room
on
the
top
floor
of
the
building
ordinarily
unused
what
story
was
it
that
alma
frothingham
told
last
night
of
her
visit
to
the
office
of
and
rolfe
had
not
paid
much
attention
to
it
at
the
time
now
he
recalled
the
anecdote
and
was
more
impressed
by
its
significance
that
room
his
first
place
of
business
the
scene
of
poor
beginnings
bennet
frothingham
had
chosen
for
his
place
of
death
perhaps
he
had
long
foreseen
this
possibility
had
mused
upon
the
dramatic
fitness
of
such
an
end
for
there
was
a
strain
of
melancholy
in
the
man
legible
on
his
countenance
perceptible
in
his
private
conversation
just
about
the
time
when
alma
laughingly
told
the
story
her
father
must
have
been
sitting
in
that
upper
room
thinking
his
last
thoughts
or
it
might
be
that
he
lay
already
dead
later
issues
contained
much
fuller
reports
the
man
who
found
the
body
had
explained
his
behaviour
in
going
up
to
the
unused
room
and
it
relieved
the
dark
affair
with
a
touch
of
comedy
before
coming
to
work
he
had
quarrelled
with
his
wife
and
rather
than
go
home
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
hit
upon
the
idea
of
finding
a
here
on
the
premises
to
which
he
could
slink
unnoticed
little
enough
sleep
i
get
in
my
own
house
was
his
remark
to
the
reporter
who
won
his
confidence
clubmen
were
hilarious
over
this
incident
speculating
as
to
the
result
of
its
publication
on
the
indiscreet
domestic
troubles
it
was
not
unremarked
that
a
long
time
elapsed
between
the
discovery
of
the
suicide
and
its
being
heard
of
by
anyone
who
had
an
interest
in
making
it
generally
known
with
the
exception
of
two
persons
all
who
were
engaged
upon
the
production
of
the
newspaper
went
home
in
complete
ignorance
of
what
had
happened
so
cautiously
and
successfully
was
the
situation
dealt
with
by
the
and
his
informant
when
after
an
examination
by
the
doctor
who
had
been
summoned
in
all
secrecy
it
became
necessary
to
communicate
with
the
police
the
employees
had
all
gone
away
and
the
printed
sheets
had
been
conveyed
to
the
distributing
agents
naturally
the
subeditor
of
and
preserved
a
certain
reticence
in
the
matter
but
one
could
hardly
be
mistaken
in
assuming
that
the
directors
of
the
britannia
company
two
or
three
of
them
at
all
events
had
an
opportunity
of
surveying
their
position
long
before
the
hour
when
this
momentous
news
got
abroad
with
regard
to
the
company
affairs
only
conjecture
could
be
as
yet
indulged
in
in
view
of
the
immediate
stoppage
of
business
it
was
pretty
safe
to
surmise
that
alarming
disclosures
awaited
the
public
no
one
of
course
would
be
justified
in
prejudging
the
case
against
the
unhappy
man
who
amid
seemingly
brilliant
circumstances
had
been
driven
to
so
desperate
an
act
and
so
on
and
so
on
in
one
journal
after
another
in
edition
upon
edition
harvey
rolfe
read
them
till
he
was
weary
listened
to
the
gossip
of
the
club
till
he
was
nauseated
he
went
home
at
length
with
a
headache
and
having
carefully
avoided
contact
with
buncombe
or
mrs
handover
made
an
effort
to
absorb
himself
in
a
volume
of
gregorovius
which
was
at
present
his
study
the
attempt
was
futile
talk
still
seemed
to
buzz
about
him
his
temples
throbbed
his
thoughts
wandered
far
and
wide
driven
to
bed
long
before
his
accustomed
hour
he
heard
raucous
voices
rending
the
night
bellowing
in
hideous
antiphony
from
this
side
of
the
street
and
the
other
as
the
vendors
of
a
halfpenny
paper
made
the
most
of
what
providence
had
sent
them
the
first
thing
after
breakfast
next
morning
he
posted
a
line
to
hugh
carnaby
there
any
way
in
which
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
if
you
think
not
i
shall
be
off
tomorrow
to
greystone
for
a
few
days
i
feel
as
if
we
were
all
being
swept
into
a
ghastly
whirlpool
which
roars
over
the
bottomless
pit
of
course
i
will
stay
if
i
can
do
anything
no
matter
what
otherwise
address
for
a
week
to
basil
morton
this
he
dropped
into
the
nearest
and
as
the
sun
was
endeavouring
to
shine
he
walked
the
length
of
the
street
a
pretence
of
exercise
on
his
way
back
he
was
preceded
by
a
telegraph
boy
who
stopped
at
buncombe
front
door
and
awoke
the
echoes
with
a
twofold
double
knock
before
the
servant
could
open
harvey
was
on
the
steps
name
me
then
he
tore
open
the
envelope
you
come
at
once
something
has
abbott
the
boy
wished
to
know
if
there
would
be
a
reply
harvey
shook
his
head
and
stepped
into
the
hall
where
he
stood
reflecting
what
could
have
happened
that
edgar
abbott
should
summon
him
had
his
wife
run
away
ah
to
be
sure
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
children
an
accident
a
death
but
why
send
for
he
made
a
little
change
in
his
dress
and
drove
forthwith
to
kilburn
as
his
cab
stopped
he
saw
that
all
the
blinds
in
the
front
of
the
abbotts
house
were
drawn
down
death
then
obviously
it
was
with
a
painful
shaking
of
the
nerves
that
he
knocked
for
admission
abbott
the
servant
girl
who
had
a
face
said
nothing
but
left
him
where
he
stood
returning
in
a
moment
with
a
mumbled
you
please
to
come
in
sir
he
followed
her
to
the
room
in
which
he
had
talked
with
abbott
two
days
ago
and
she
it
was
who
again
received
him
her
back
to
the
light
she
stood
motionless
husband
has
telegraphed
for
me
a
voice
that
struggled
with
a
sob
made
thick
reply
i
he
is
dead
the
accent
of
that
last
monosyllable
was
it
seemed
to
harvey
as
though
the
word
were
so
full
it
sounded
of
dreadful
meaning
abbott
moved
and
he
could
see
her
face
better
she
must
have
wept
for
hours
has
been
taking
morphia
he
could
sleep
well
and
then
his
neuralgia
the
girl
found
him
this
morning
at
seven
there
she
pointed
to
the
couch
mean
that
he
had
taken
an
overdose
by
accident
have
been
so
he
had
to
work
late
and
then
he
must
have
lain
down
to
sleep
here
flood
of
anguish
whelmed
her
she
uttered
a
long
moan
all
the
more
terrible
for
its
subdual
to
a
sound
that
could
not
pass
beyond
the
room
her
struggle
for
made
her
suffering
only
the
more
impressive
the
more
grievous
to
behold
rolfe
i
sent
for
you
because
you
are
his
old
friend
i
meant
to
tell
you
all
the
truth
as
i
know
it
i
tell
it
before
strangers
in
public
i
let
them
know
the
shame
the
shame
harvey
sympathy
gave
way
to
astonishment
and
strange
surmise
hurriedly
he
besought
her
not
to
reveal
anything
in
her
present
distress
to
wait
till
she
could
reflect
calmly
see
things
in
truer
proportion
his
embarrassment
was
heightened
by
an
inability
to
identify
this
woman
with
the
abbott
he
had
known
the
change
in
her
seemed
as
great
and
sudden
as
that
in
her
circumstances
face
and
voice
though
scarce
recognisable
had
changed
less
than
the
soul
of
her
as
harvey
imaged
it
this
entreaty
she
replied
to
with
a
steadiness
a
resolve
which
left
him
no
choice
but
to
listen
can
not
dare
not
think
that
he
did
this
knowingly
no
he
was
too
brave
for
that
he
would
never
have
left
me
in
that
way
to
my
despair
but
it
was
my
fault
that
made
him
angry
no
not
angry
he
was
never
that
with
me
or
never
showed
it
but
i
had
behaved
with
such
utter
selfishness
her
misery
refused
to
word
itself
she
sank
down
upon
a
chair
and
sobbed
and
moaned
grief
exaggerates
every
little
fault
said
harvey
you
must
hear
it
all
then
perhaps
i
can
hide
my
shame
from
strangers
what
use
would
it
be
if
they
knew
it
alters
nothing
only
in
my
own
heart
i
have
no
right
to
pain
you
like
this
i
will
tell
you
quietly
you
know
that
he
went
to
waterbury
on
business
did
he
tell
you
it
was
to
buy
a
share
in
a
local
newspaper
i
in
my
blindness
and
selfishness
disliked
that
i
wanted
to
live
here
the
thought
of
going
to
live
in
the
country
seemed
unbearable
that
edgar
was
overworked
and
ill
seemed
to
me
a
trifle
do
you
remember
how
i
spoke
of
it
when
you
came
here
the
other
morning
i
ca
understand
myself
how
could
i
think
so
speak
so
the
listener
said
nothing
did
what
he
purposed
made
a
bargain
and
came
back
to
conclude
the
purchase
by
correspondence
but
his
money
the
small
capital
he
counted
upon
was
in
britannia
shares
and
you
know
what
happened
yesterday
yesterday
the
very
day
when
he
went
to
sell
the
shares
thinking
to
do
so
without
the
least
difficulty
harvey
gave
a
grim
nod
came
home
and
i
showed
that
i
was
glad
you
accuse
yourself
unreasonably
tell
you
the
truth
as
my
miserable
conscience
knows
it
i
was
crazy
with
selfishness
and
conceit
rightly
he
left
me
to
my
cowardly
temper
and
went
out
again
and
was
away
for
a
long
time
he
came
back
to
dinner
and
then
the
suffering
in
his
face
all
but
taught
me
what
i
was
doing
i
wanted
to
ask
him
to
forgive
me
to
comfort
him
for
his
loss
but
pride
kept
me
from
it
i
could
speak
i
could
after
dinner
he
said
he
had
a
lot
of
work
to
do
and
came
into
this
room
at
ten
i
sent
him
coffee
i
wished
to
take
it
myself
o
god
if
only
i
had
done
so
i
to
take
it
and
speak
to
him
but
still
i
could
and
i
knew
he
was
in
torture
i
saw
at
dinner
that
pain
was
racking
him
but
i
kept
away
and
went
to
my
own
bed
and
slept
whilst
he
was
lying
here
a
rush
of
tears
relieved
her
harvey
felt
his
own
eyes
grow
moist
was
only
that
he
felt
so
worn
out
she
pursued
know
how
it
was
the
pain
grew
intolerable
and
he
went
upstairs
for
his
draught
and
then
not
having
finished
his
work
he
thought
he
would
lie
down
on
the
sofa
for
a
little
and
so
sleep
overcame
him
he
never
meant
if
i
thought
it
i
could
live
you
are
right
said
harvey
summoning
an
accent
of
conviction
knew
him
very
well
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
do
that
you
are
sure
of
it
you
feel
it
impossible
mr
rolfe
impossible
there
are
men
oh
you
may
assure
yourself
that
it
was
pure
accident
unfortunately
it
happens
so
often
she
hung
on
his
words
leaning
towards
him
her
eyes
wide
and
lips
parted
often
i
have
seen
so
many
cases
in
the
papers
and
he
was
but
what
right
have
i
to
seek
comfort
for
myself
was
i
any
less
the
cause
of
his
death
but
must
i
tell
all
this
in
public
do
you
think
i
ought
to
with
comfortable
sincerity
rolfe
was
able
to
maintain
the
needlessness
of
divulging
anything
beyond
the
state
of
abbott
health
and
his
pecuniary
troubles
is
as
if
we
had
lived
on
ill
terms
with
each
other
said
the
widow
with
a
sigh
of
gratitude
but
that
until
of
late
we
never
knew
a
difference
and
the
change
that
came
was
wholly
my
fault
i
had
the
honesty
to
speak
out
and
say
what
was
in
my
mind
i
never
openly
opposed
his
wish
to
leave
london
i
pretended
to
agree
to
everything
pretended
he
showed
me
all
his
reasons
put
everything
simply
and
plainly
and
kindly
before
me
and
if
i
had
said
what
i
thought
i
feel
sure
he
would
have
given
it
up
at
once
it
was
in
my
own
hands
to
decide
one
way
or
the
other
should
you
reproach
yourself
so
with
mere
thoughts
of
which
he
never
became
aware
it
was
yesterday
when
he
came
back
from
the
city
he
knew
then
that
i
was
glad
he
could
carry
out
his
purpose
he
looked
at
me
as
he
never
had
done
before
a
look
of
surprise
and
estrangement
i
shall
always
see
that
look
on
his
face
harvey
talked
in
the
strain
of
solace
feeling
how
extraordinary
was
his
position
and
that
of
all
men
he
had
least
fitness
for
such
an
office
it
relieved
him
when
without
undue
abruptness
he
could
pass
to
the
practical
urgencies
of
the
case
were
wager
children
still
in
the
house
alas
they
were
and
abbott
knew
not
what
to
do
about
them
ca
think
of
anyone
who
would
take
them
for
a
day
or
two
even
among
her
acquaintances
there
was
not
one
of
whom
she
could
venture
to
ask
such
a
service
have
such
a
dread
of
children
her
sister
was
a
governess
in
ireland
other
near
relatives
she
had
none
edgar
abbott
mother
old
and
in
feeble
health
lived
near
waterbury
how
was
the
dreadful
news
to
be
conveyed
to
her
harvey
bestirred
himself
here
at
all
events
was
a
call
to
active
usefulness
he
felt
the
privilege
of
money
and
leisure
you
give
me
the
name
of
any
one
at
waterbury
who
would
be
a
fit
person
to
break
the
news
to
mrs
abbott
two
names
were
mentioned
and
he
noted
them
will
send
telegrams
at
once
to
both
will
say
it
was
an
accident
shall
be
made
clear
as
for
the
children
i
think
i
can
have
them
taken
away
this
morning
in
the
house
where
i
live
there
is
a
decent
woman
who
i
dare
say
would
be
willing
to
look
after
them
for
the
present
will
you
leave
this
entirely
in
my
hands
am
ashamed
i
do
know
how
to
thank
you
time
shall
be
lost
he
rose
handover
will
help
us
i
will
bring
her
here
then
i
shall
see
you
again
in
any
case
of
course
i
will
come
back
there
will
be
other
business
but
you
ought
to
have
some
friend
some
lady
one
i
can
ask
but
of
all
the
people
you
know
in
london
surely
are
not
friends
in
that
sense
i
understand
it
now
fifty
acquaintances
no
friend
let
me
think
let
me
think
what
was
the
name
of
that
lady
i
met
here
whose
children
you
used
to
teach
langland
she
is
very
kind
and
friendly
but
she
lives
at
gunnersbury
so
far
and
i
could
trouble
her
upon
one
meeting
and
a
short
conversation
with
subsequent
remarks
from
edgar
abbott
rolfe
had
grounded
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
mrs
langland
she
dwelt
clearly
in
his
mind
as
woman
with
no
nonsense
about
her
likely
to
be
of
much
helpfulness
at
a
crisis
such
as
the
present
with
difficulty
he
persuaded
abbott
to
sit
down
and
write
a
few
lines
to
be
posted
at
once
to
gunnersbury
have
dared
to
ask
her
to
come
but
i
have
said
that
i
am
alone
enough
i
think
if
she
is
at
home
he
took
his
leave
and
drove
back
to
bayswater
posting
the
letter
and
despatching
two
telegrams
on
the
way
of
course
his
visit
to
greystone
was
given
up
chapter
hugh
carnaby
was
gratified
by
the
verdict
of
de
he
applauded
the
jury
for
their
most
unexpected
honesty
one
had
taken
for
granted
the
foolish
tag
about
temporary
madness
which
would
have
been
an
insult
to
everybody
a
pity
they
no
longer
bury
at
four
with
a
stake
in
his
inside
where
that
from
i
remember
it
somehow
the
example
would
be
bad
rather
replied
sibyl
who
by
this
term
was
wont
to
signify
barbarism
or
crudity
in
art
letters
morality
or
social
feeling
there
no
merit
in
the
verdict
it
only
means
that
the
city
jury
is
in
a
rage
yet
every
one
of
them
would
be
dishonest
on
as
great
a
scale
if
they
dared
or
had
the
chance
in
that
i
dare
say
conceded
hugh
he
admired
his
wife
more
than
ever
calm
when
she
lost
her
trinkets
sibyl
exhibited
no
less
now
that
she
was
suddenly
deprived
of
her
whole
fortune
about
eight
hundred
a
year
she
had
once
remarked
on
the
pleasantness
and
fitness
of
a
wife
possessing
in
her
own
name
an
income
equal
to
that
of
her
husband
yet
she
resigned
it
without
fuss
indeed
sibyl
never
made
a
fuss
about
anything
she
intimated
her
wishes
and
as
they
were
always
possible
of
gratification
obtained
them
as
a
matter
of
course
naturally
since
their
marriage
she
and
hugh
had
lived
to
the
full
extent
of
their
means
carnaby
had
reduced
his
capital
by
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
in
preliminary
expenses
and
debt
to
the
amount
of
two
or
three
hundred
was
outstanding
at
the
end
of
the
first
twelvemonth
but
sibyl
manifested
no
alarm
have
been
great
fools
she
said
alluding
to
their
faith
in
bennet
frothingham
certain
that
have
replied
her
husband
ought
to
have
let
your
mother
have
her
way
about
that
money
if
there
had
been
a
proper
settlement
you
would
have
run
no
risk
trustees
could
have
allowed
such
an
investment
the
same
day
sibyl
bought
a
fur
for
her
neck
which
cost
fifteen
guineas
the
weather
was
turning
cold
and
she
had
an
account
at
the
shop
that
afternoon
too
she
went
to
see
her
mother
and
on
returning
at
six
looked
into
the
library
where
hugh
sat
by
the
fire
a
book
in
his
hand
carnaby
found
the
days
very
long
just
now
he
shunned
his
clubs
the
metropolitan
and
the
ramblers
because
of
a
fear
that
his
connection
with
the
was
generally
known
to
hear
talk
on
the
subject
would
make
him
savage
he
was
grievously
perturbed
in
mind
by
his
position
and
prospects
and
want
of
exercise
had
begun
to
affect
his
health
as
always
he
greeted
his
wife
entrance
with
a
smile
and
rose
to
place
a
chair
for
her
i
wo
sit
down
said
sibyl
look
comfortable
she
looked
at
him
reflectively
and
said
in
balanced
tones
really
think
i
can
boast
of
having
the
most
selfish
mother
in
england
hugh
had
his
own
opinion
concerning
ascott
larkfield
but
would
not
have
ventured
to
phrase
it
that
never
knew
anyone
who
succeeded
so
well
in
thinking
steadily
and
exclusively
of
herself
it
irritates
me
to
see
her
since
this
affair
i
sha
go
again
i
really
did
know
what
a
detestable
temper
she
has
her
talk
is
outrageous
she
does
behave
like
a
lady
could
you
believe
that
she
has
written
a
violent
letter
to
frothingham
speaking
her
mind
as
she
says
it
disgraceful
sorry
she
has
done
that
but
it
is
every
one
that
can
bear
injury
as
you
do
sibyl
supposed
she
could
behave
herself
she
raises
her
voice
and
uses
outrageous
words
and
shows
temper
with
the
servants
i
would
spend
a
day
in
that
house
now
on
any
account
and
after
all
i
find
she
has
lost
much
more
than
i
have
she
will
be
able
to
count
on
six
hundred
a
year
at
least
carnaby
received
the
news
with
a
brightened
visage
come
that
something
took
very
good
care
you
see
not
to
risk
everything
herself
possible
said
hugh
she
had
control
of
all
her
money
yes
she
had
she
let
that
fact
escape
in
her
fury
congratulated
herself
on
being
so
far
prudent
really
i
never
knew
a
more
hateful
woman
it
was
said
without
vehemence
with
none
of
that
raising
of
the
voice
which
so
offended
her
a
deliberate
judgment
in
carefully
chosen
words
hugh
tried
to
smile
but
could
not
quite
command
his
features
they
expressed
an
uneasy
thoughtfulness
you
go
out
this
evening
he
asked
after
a
pause
i
rather
tired
and
out
of
sorts
dinner
is
at
seven
i
shall
go
to
bed
early
the
police
had
as
yet
failed
to
get
upon
the
track
of
the
felonious
housekeeper
known
as
maskell
carnaby
other
servants
still
kept
their
places
protesting
innocence
and
doubtless
afraid
to
leave
lest
they
should
incur
suspicion
domestic
management
was
now
in
the
hands
of
the
cook
sibyl
always
declared
that
she
could
not
eat
a
dinner
she
had
had
the
trouble
of
ordering
and
she
seemed
unaffectedly
to
shrink
from
persons
of
the
menial
class
as
though
with
physical
repulsion
perforce
she
submitted
to
having
her
hair
done
by
her
maid
but
she
found
the
necessity
disagreeable
the
dinner
was
simple
but
well
cooked
sibyl
never
ate
with
hearty
appetite
and
declined
everything
not
of
excellent
quality
unlike
women
in
general
she
was
fastidious
about
wine
yet
took
of
it
sparingly
liqueurs
too
she
enjoyed
and
very
strong
coffee
to
a
cigarette
in
the
mouth
of
a
woman
she
utterly
objected
it
offended
her
sense
of
the
becoming
her
delicate
perception
of
propriety
when
dining
alone
or
with
hugh
she
dressed
as
carefully
as
for
a
ceremonious
occasion
any
approach
to
personal
disorder
or
neglect
was
inconceivable
in
sibyl
her
husband
had
by
accident
heard
her
called
woman
in
london
he
thought
the
praise
well
merited
and
it
flattered
him
at
table
they
talked
of
things
as
remote
as
possible
from
their
immediate
concerns
and
with
the
usual
good
humour
when
he
rose
to
open
the
door
hugh
said
or
library
you
would
like
to
smoke
for
ten
minutes
he
sat
with
his
arms
on
the
table
his
great
hands
loosely
clenched
before
him
he
drank
nothing
his
gaze
was
fixed
on
a
dish
of
fruit
and
widened
as
if
in
a
growing
perplexity
then
he
recovered
himself
gave
a
snort
and
went
to
join
his
wife
sibyl
was
reading
a
newspaper
hugh
lit
his
pipe
in
silence
and
sat
down
opposite
to
her
presently
the
newspaper
dropped
and
sibyl
eyes
were
turned
upon
her
husband
with
a
smile
they
smiled
at
each
other
amiably
do
you
suggest
birdie
the
fondling
name
was
not
very
appropriate
and
had
not
been
used
of
late
carnaby
hit
upon
it
in
the
honeymoon
days
when
he
said
that
his
wife
was
like
some
little
lovely
bird
which
he
great
coarse
fellow
had
captured
and
almost
feared
to
touch
lest
he
should
hurt
it
hugh
had
not
much
originality
of
thought
and
less
of
expression
are
places
you
know
where
one
lives
very
comfortably
on
very
little
said
sibyl
but
it
leads
to
nothing
lead
to
anything
you
see
i
have
capital
and
some
use
ought
to
be
made
of
it
everybody
nowadays
goes
in
for
some
kind
of
business
she
listened
with
interest
smiling
meditative
a
great
many
people
come
out
of
it
wishing
they
had
done
so
before
said
carnaby
the
difficulty
i
had
a
letter
from
dando
this
morning
he
has
got
somebody
to
believe
in
his
new
smelting
process
somebody
in
the
city
talks
of
going
out
to
queensland
shortly
really
if
i
could
be
on
the
spot
he
hesitated
timidly
indicating
his
thoughts
sibyl
mused
and
slowly
shook
her
head
wait
for
reports
but
it
those
who
are
in
it
first
you
see
sibyl
seemed
to
forget
the
immediate
subject
and
to
let
her
thoughts
wander
in
pleasant
directions
she
spoke
as
if
on
a
happy
impulse
one
place
i
think
i
should
like
though
i
dread
the
voyage
that
has
put
that
into
your
head
i
have
read
about
it
the
climate
is
absolute
perfection
and
the
life
exquisite
how
do
you
get
there
america
and
then
from
san
francisco
it
anything
but
a
cheap
place
i
believe
for
a
time
the
thing
is
to
get
away
do
you
think
doubt
of
honolulu
by
jove
it
an
idea
i
should
like
to
see
those
islands
myself
it
is
commonplace
remarked
sibyl
would
go
off
with
a
certain
eclat
very
different
from
starting
for
the
continent
in
the
humdrum
way
the
more
carnaby
thought
of
it
the
better
he
liked
this
suggestion
that
sibyl
should
voluntarily
propose
so
long
a
journey
surprised
and
delighted
him
the
tropics
were
not
his
favourite
region
and
those
islands
of
the
pacific
offered
no
scope
for
profitable
energy
he
did
not
want
to
climb
volcanoes
still
less
to
lounge
beneath
bananas
and
however
pleasant
such
an
escape
from
civilisation
might
seem
at
the
first
glance
a
year
of
marriage
of
idleness
amid
amusements
luxuries
extravagances
for
which
he
had
no
taste
was
bearing
its
natural
result
in
masculine
restiveness
his
robust
physique
and
temper
essentially
combative
demanded
liberty
under
conditions
of
rude
or
violent
life
he
was
not
likely
to
find
a
satisfying
range
in
any
mode
of
existence
that
would
be
shared
by
sibyl
but
he
clutched
at
any
chance
of
extensive
travel
it
might
be
necessary
it
certainly
would
be
to
make
further
incision
into
his
capital
and
so
diminish
the
annual
return
upon
which
he
could
count
for
the
future
but
when
his
income
had
already
become
ludicrously
inadequate
what
did
that
matter
the
years
of
independence
were
past
somehow
or
other
he
must
make
money
everybody
did
it
nowadays
and
an
would
of
course
present
itself
something
would
of
course
up
he
stretched
his
limbs
in
a
sudden
vast
relief
the
idea
is
excellent
shall
we
sell
all
this
stuff
waving
a
hand
to
indicate
the
furniture
i
think
not
warehouse
it
hugh
would
have
rejoiced
to
turn
every
chair
and
table
into
hard
cash
not
only
for
the
money
sake
but
for
the
sense
of
freedom
that
would
follow
but
he
agreed
as
always
to
whatever
his
wife
preferred
they
talked
with
unwonted
animation
a
great
atlas
was
opened
routes
were
fingered
half
the
earth
circumference
vanished
in
a
twinkling
sibyl
hitherto
mewed
within
the
circle
of
european
gaieties
and
relaxations
all
at
once
let
her
fancy
fly
tasted
a
new
luxury
in
experiences
from
which
she
had
shrunk
order
my
outfit
tomorrow
very
light
things
i
suppose
who
could
advise
me
about
that
among
a
number
of
notes
and
letters
which
she
wrote
next
day
was
one
to
miss
frothingham
alma
it
began
and
it
ended
with
affectionately
just
as
usual
you
possibly
come
here
some
day
this
week
i
have
written
before
and
have
tried
to
see
you
because
i
felt
sure
you
would
rather
be
left
alone
at
the
same
time
i
feel
sure
that
what
has
happened
though
for
a
time
it
will
sadden
us
both
can
not
affect
our
friendship
i
want
to
see
you
as
we
are
going
away
very
soon
first
of
all
to
appoint
your
own
time
i
will
be
here
by
return
of
post
came
the
answer
which
began
with
sibyl
and
closed
with
affectionately
can
not
tell
you
how
relieved
i
am
to
get
your
kind
letter
these
dreadful
days
have
made
me
ill
and
one
thing
that
increased
my
misery
was
the
fear
that
i
should
never
hear
from
you
again
i
should
not
have
dared
to
write
how
noble
you
are
but
then
i
always
knew
that
i
can
not
come
tomorrow
you
know
why
but
the
next
day
i
will
be
with
you
at
three
if
you
do
tell
me
that
the
hour
is
inconvenient
they
met
at
the
appointed
time
carnaby
fine
sense
of
the
becoming
declared
itself
in
dark
array
her
voice
was
tenderly
subdued
the
pressure
of
her
hand
the
softly
lingering
touch
of
her
lips
conveyed
a
sympathy
which
perfect
taste
would
not
allow
to
become
demonstrative
alma
could
at
first
say
nothing
the
faint
rose
upon
her
cheek
had
vanished
her
eyes
were
heavy
and
lacked
their
vital
gleam
her
mouth
no
longer
mobile
and
provocative
trembled
on
the
verge
of
sobs
pathetic
childlike
she
hung
her
head
moved
with
a
languid
diffident
step
looked
smaller
and
slighter
a
fashionable
garb
of
woe
aiding
the
unhappy
transformation
ought
to
have
given
you
this
trouble
said
sibyl
perhaps
you
would
rather
see
me
here
oh
yes
it
was
much
better
down
dear
we
wo
talk
of
wretched
things
will
we
if
i
could
have
been
of
any
use
to
you
was
so
afraid
you
would
never
you
know
me
better
than
that
broke
in
carnaby
almost
with
cheerfulness
her
countenance
already
throwing
off
the
decorous
shadow
like
a
cloak
that
had
served
its
turn
hope
i
am
neither
foolish
nor
indeed
not
you
are
goodness
itself
is
mrs
frothingham
the
question
was
asked
with
infinite
delicacy
head
and
body
bent
forward
eyes
floatingly
averted
ill
i
afraid
she
has
fainted
several
times
yesterday
was
unconscious
for
nearly
half
an
hour
sibyl
flinched
mention
of
physical
suffering
affected
her
most
disagreeably
she
always
shunned
the
proximity
of
people
in
ill
health
and
a
possibility
of
infection
struck
her
with
panic
i
so
sorry
but
it
will
pass
over
hope
so
i
have
done
what
i
could
sure
you
have
it
so
hard
when
every
word
of
comfort
sounds
heartless
when
it
kindest
to
say
nothing
wo
talk
about
it
dear
you
yourself
i
can
see
what
you
have
gone
through
you
must
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
this
gloomy
weather
makes
everything
worse
she
paused
and
with
an
air
of
discreet
interest
awaited
alma
reply
i
hope
to
get
away
i
shall
see
if
it
possible
the
girl
look
strayed
with
a
tired
uncertainty
her
hands
never
ceased
to
move
and
fidget
only
the
habits
of
good
breeding
kept
her
body
still
course
it
is
too
soon
for
you
to
have
made
plans
so
difficult
replied
alma
her
features
more
naturally
expressive
her
eyes
a
little
brighter
see
i
am
utterly
dependent
upon
mamma
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
mamma
will
have
enough
to
live
upon
however
things
turn
out
she
has
money
of
her
own
but
of
course
i
have
nothing
nothing
whatever
i
think
most
likely
mamma
will
go
to
live
with
her
sister
in
the
country
for
a
time
she
could
bear
to
go
on
living
in
london
and
she
does
like
life
abroad
if
only
i
could
do
as
i
wish
guess
what
that
would
be
said
the
other
smiling
gently
take
up
music
as
a
profession
yes
but
i
not
ready
for
it
half
a
year
of
serious
study
with
your
decided
talent
i
should
think
you
could
hesitate
you
are
a
born
musician
the
words
acted
as
a
cordial
alma
roused
herself
lifted
her
drooping
head
and
smiled
the
praise
of
a
friend
the
serious
opinion
of
one
not
quite
unfit
to
judge
rejoined
sibyl
with
her
air
of
tranquil
we
have
agreed
have
we
that
the
impulse
is
everything
what
you
wish
for
try
for
just
now
you
have
lost
courage
you
are
not
yourself
wait
till
you
recover
your
balance
is
that
i
want
to
make
a
name
or
anything
of
that
sort
said
alma
in
a
voice
that
was
recovering
its
ordinary
pitch
and
melody
dare
say
i
never
should
i
might
just
support
myself
and
that
would
be
all
but
i
want
to
be
free
i
want
to
break
away
course
have
been
thinking
that
i
shall
beg
mamma
to
let
me
have
just
a
small
allowance
and
go
off
by
myself
i
know
people
at
leipzig
the
gassners
you
remember
i
could
live
there
on
little
enough
and
work
and
feel
free
of
course
there
really
no
reason
why
i
should
i
have
been
feeling
so
bound
and
helpless
and
now
that
nobody
has
any
right
to
hinder
me
you
think
it
would
be
the
wise
thing
alma
had
occasionally
complained
to
her
friend
as
she
did
the
other
evening
to
harvey
rolfe
that
easy
circumstances
were
not
favourable
to
artistic
ambition
but
no
very
serious
disquiet
had
ever
declared
itself
in
her
ordinary
talk
the
phrases
she
now
used
and
the
look
that
accompanied
them
caused
sibyl
some
amusement
only
two
years
older
than
alma
carnaby
enjoyed
a
more
than
proportionate
superiority
in
knowledge
of
the
world
her
education
had
been
more
steadily
directed
to
that
end
and
her
natural
aptitude
for
the
study
was
more
pronounced
that
she
really
liked
alma
seemed
as
certain
as
that
she
felt
neither
affection
nor
esteem
for
any
other
person
of
her
own
sex
herself
not
much
inclined
to
feminine
friendship
alma
had
from
the
first
paid
voluntary
homage
to
sibyl
intellectual
claims
and
thought
it
a
privilege
to
be
admitted
to
her
intimacy
being
persuaded
moreover
that
in
sibyl
and
in
sibyl
alone
she
found
genuine
appreciation
of
her
musical
talent
sibyl
choice
of
a
husband
had
secretly
surprised
and
disappointed
her
for
hugh
carnaby
was
not
the
type
of
man
in
whom
she
felt
an
interest
and
he
seemed
to
her
totally
unworthy
of
his
good
fortune
but
this
perplexity
passed
and
was
forgotten
she
saw
that
sibyl
underwent
no
subjugation
nay
that
the
married
woman
did
but
perfect
herself
in
those
qualities
of
mind
and
mood
whereby
she
had
shone
as
a
maiden
it
was
a
combination
of
powers
and
virtues
which
appeared
to
alma
little
short
of
the
ideal
in
womanhood
the
example
influenced
her
developing
character
in
ways
she
recognised
and
in
others
of
which
she
remained
quite
unconscious
think
you
could
do
better
carnaby
replied
to
the
last
question
that
she
paused
intentionally
with
an
air
of
soft
solicitude
of
bland
wisdom
just
what
i
wanted
said
alma
eagerly
me
tell
me
just
what
you
think
want
to
live
alone
and
to
have
done
with
all
the
silly
conventionalities
and
proprieties
our
old
friend
grundy
in
fact
it
you
understand
me
perfectly
as
you
always
do
it
had
been
possible
we
would
have
lived
together
how
delightful
do
speak
of
what
ca
be
was
going
to
say
pursued
sibyl
thoughtfully
you
will
meet
with
all
sorts
of
little
troubles
and
worries
which
you
have
never
had
any
experience
of
for
one
thing
you
know
she
leaned
back
smiling
at
ease
wo
behave
to
you
quite
as
you
have
been
accustomed
to
expect
money
is
very
important
even
to
a
man
but
to
a
woman
it
means
more
than
you
can
imagine
but
i
sha
be
living
among
the
kind
of
people
no
perhaps
you
do
quite
understand
me
yet
it
is
the
people
you
seek
who
matter
but
the
people
that
will
seek
and
some
of
them
will
have
very
strange
ideas
very
strange
indeed
alma
looked
kept
her
eyes
down
and
at
length
nodded
i
think
i
understand
why
i
said
provided
you
are
not
the
ordinary
girl
and
you
wo
imagine
that
i
feared
for
you
i
know
you
too
well
it
a
question
of
being
informed
and
on
one
guard
i
do
think
anyone
else
who
would
talk
to
you
like
this
it
does
offend
you
then
that
all
right
go
into
the
world
by
all
means
but
go
prepared
armed
the
word
is
a
bit
too
strong
as
i
know
perfectly
some
day
perhaps
but
there
no
need
to
talk
about
such
things
now
alma
kept
a
short
silence
breaking
it
at
length
with
note
of
exultation
quite
decided
now
i
wanted
just
to
hear
what
you
would
say
i
sha
wait
a
day
longer
than
i
can
help
the
old
life
is
over
for
me
if
only
it
had
come
about
in
some
other
way
i
should
be
singing
with
rapture
i
going
to
begin
to
live
she
quivered
with
intensity
of
feeling
or
with
that
excitement
of
the
nerves
which
simulates
intense
feeling
in
certain
natures
a
flush
stole
to
her
cheek
her
eyes
were
once
more
full
of
light
sibyl
regarded
her
observantly
and
with
admiration
never
thought
of
the
stage
alma
stage
acting
i
see
you
never
did
and
it
would
do
of
course
it
would
do
something
in
your
look
it
just
crossed
my
mind
but
of
course
you
have
much
greater
things
before
you
it
means
hard
work
and
i
only
afraid
you
work
yourself
all
but
to
death
should
wonder
replied
the
girl
with
a
little
laugh
of
pride
in
this
possibility
i
too
am
going
away
you
know
alma
countenance
fell
shame
again
crept
over
it
and
she
murmured
sibyl
distress
yourself
the
least
on
my
account
that
an
understood
thing
no
mention
no
allusion
ever
between
us
and
the
truth
is
that
my
position
is
just
a
little
like
yours
on
the
whole
i
rather
glad
hugh
wants
desperately
to
get
to
the
other
end
of
the
world
and
i
dare
say
it
the
best
thing
i
could
do
to
go
with
him
no
roughing
it
of
course
that
is
in
my
way
should
think
not
indeed
i
may
rise
to
those
heights
who
knows
if
the
new
sensation
ever
seemed
worth
the
in
a
year
or
two
we
shall
meet
and
compare
notes
do
expect
long
descriptive
letters
i
do
care
to
do
indifferently
what
other
people
have
done
well
and
put
into
print
a
waste
of
energy
but
you
are
sure
to
have
far
more
interesting
and
original
things
to
tell
about
it
will
read
so
piquantly
i
sure
at
honolulu
they
drank
tea
together
and
talked
in
all
for
a
couple
of
hours
when
she
rose
to
leave
alma
but
for
her
sombre
drapings
was
totally
changed
from
the
limp
woebegone
shrinking
girl
who
had
at
first
presented
herself
no
one
else
she
said
would
have
behaved
to
me
so
kindly
and
so
nobly
but
nonsense
too
let
us
admire
each
other
it
does
us
good
and
is
so
very
pleasant
shall
say
goodbye
to
no
one
but
you
let
people
think
and
say
of
me
what
they
like
i
do
care
a
snap
of
the
fingers
in
deed
i
people
sexes
impartially
it
was
a
peculiarity
of
their
intimate
converse
that
they
never
talked
of
men
and
a
jest
of
this
kind
had
novelty
sufficient
to
affect
alma
with
a
slight
confusion
quite
she
answered
make
an
exception
in
favour
of
hugh
friend
rolfe
i
abandon
all
the
rest
alma
betrayed
surprise
i
really
thought
you
did
much
like
rolfe
she
said
without
any
show
of
embarrassment
did
when
i
first
knew
him
but
he
grows
upon
one
i
think
him
interesting
he
is
quite
easy
to
understand
he
is
they
smiled
with
the
confidence
of
women
and
said
no
more
on
the
subject
carnaby
came
home
to
dinner
brisk
and
cheerful
he
felt
better
than
for
many
a
day
brightly
responsive
sibyl
welcomed
his
appearance
in
the
old
rolfe
for
a
minute
at
the
club
in
a
vile
temper
i
wonder
whether
he
really
has
lost
money
and
wo
confess
yet
i
do
think
so
queer
old
stick
what
his
age
asked
alma
unconcernedly
or
eight
but
i
always
think
of
him
as
fifty
suppose
he
never
marry
good
heavens
no
too
much
sense
hang
it
you
know
what
i
mean
it
would
never
suit
ca
imagine
such
a
thing
he
gets
more
and
more
booky
has
his
moods
too
and
amuses
me
with
his
jingoism
so
different
from
his
old
ways
of
talking
but
i
care
much
about
him
in
those
days
well
now
look
here
i
had
a
talk
with
a
man
i
know
about
honolulu
and
i
got
all
sorts
of
things
to
tell
dinner
very
glad
i
precious
hungry
chapter
about
the
middle
of
december
alma
frothingham
left
england
burning
with
a
fever
of
impatience
resenting
all
inquiry
and
counsel
making
pretence
of
settled
plans
really
indifferent
to
everything
but
the
prospect
of
emancipation
the
disaster
that
had
befallen
her
life
the
dishonour
darkening
upon
her
name
seemed
for
the
moment
merely
a
price
paid
for
liberty
the
shock
of
sorrow
and
dismay
had
broken
innumerable
bonds
overthrown
all
manner
of
obstacles
to
growth
of
character
of
power
she
gloried
in
a
new
intoxicating
sense
of
irresponsibility
she
saw
the
ideal
life
in
a
release
from
all
duty
and
obligation
save
to
herself
travellers
on
that
winter
day
from
antwerp
into
germany
noticed
the
english
girl
well
dressed
and
of
attractive
features
whose
excited
countenance
and
restless
manner
told
of
a
journey
in
haste
with
something
most
important
and
assuredly
not
disagreeable
at
the
end
of
it
she
was
alone
and
evidently
quite
able
to
take
care
of
herself
unlike
the
representative
english
she
did
not
reject
friendly
overtures
from
strangers
her
german
was
lame
but
she
spoke
it
with
enjoyment
laughing
at
her
stumbles
and
mistakes
with
her
in
the
railway
carriage
she
kept
a
a
professional
musician
nicht
was
her
answer
with
a
laugh
she
knew
leipzig
oh
dear
yes
and
many
other
parts
of
germany
had
travelled
a
good
deal
was
an
entirely
free
and
independent
person
quite
without
national
prejudice
indeed
without
prejudice
of
any
kind
and
in
the
same
breath
she
spoke
slightingly
if
not
contemptuously
of
england
and
everything
english
at
leipzig
she
stayed
until
the
end
of
april
living
with
a
family
named
gassner
people
whom
she
had
known
for
some
years
only
on
condition
that
she
would
take
up
her
abode
with
this
household
had
frothingham
consented
to
make
her
an
allowance
and
let
her
go
abroad
alma
fretted
at
the
restriction
she
wished
to
have
a
room
of
her
own
in
a
but
the
family
life
improved
her
command
of
german
something
gained
to
music
meanwhile
she
gave
very
little
attention
putting
off
with
one
excuse
after
another
the
beginning
of
her
serious
studies
she
seemed
to
have
quite
forgotten
that
music
was
her
and
for
the
matter
of
that
appeared
to
have
no
religion
at
all
was
her
interest
her
study
she
made
acquaintances
attended
concerts
and
the
theatre
read
multitudes
of
french
and
german
novels
but
her
habits
were
economical
all
the
pleasures
she
desired
could
be
enjoyed
at
very
small
expense
and
she
found
her
stepmother
remittances
more
than
sufficient
in
april
she
gained
frothingham
consent
to
her
removal
from
leipzig
to
munich
a
german
girl
with
whom
she
had
made
friends
was
going
to
munich
to
study
art
for
reasons
vague
even
to
herself
so
ran
her
letters
to
frothingham
she
could
not
at
leipzig
the
climate
did
not
seem
to
suit
her
she
had
suffered
from
bad
colds
and
in
short
was
doing
no
good
at
munich
lived
an
admirable
violinist
a
friend
of
herr
wilenski
who
would
be
of
great
use
to
her
short
dear
mamma
does
it
seem
to
you
rather
humiliating
that
at
the
age
of
i
should
be
begging
for
permission
to
go
here
and
there
do
this
or
that
i
know
all
your
anxieties
about
me
and
i
am
very
grateful
and
i
feel
ashamed
to
be
living
at
your
expense
but
really
i
must
go
about
making
a
career
for
myself
in
my
own
way
frothingham
yielded
and
alma
took
lodgings
in
munich
together
with
her
german
friend
english
newspapers
were
now
reporting
the
trial
of
the
directors
of
the
britannia
company
for
to
this
pass
had
things
come
the
revelations
of
the
satisfied
public
curiosity
and
excited
indignant
clamour
alma
read
and
tried
to
view
the
proceedings
as
one
for
whom
they
had
no
personal
concern
but
her
sky
darkened
her
heart
grew
heavy
the
name
of
bennet
frothingham
stood
for
criminal
recklessness
for
huge
rascality
it
would
be
so
for
years
to
come
she
had
no
courage
to
take
up
her
violin
the
sound
of
music
grew
hateful
to
her
as
if
mocking
at
her
ruined
ambition
three
months
had
passed
since
she
received
her
one
and
only
letter
from
honolulu
two
months
since
she
had
written
to
sibyl
on
a
blue
day
of
spring
when
despondency
lowered
upon
her
and
all
occupation
all
amusements
seemed
a
burden
she
was
driven
to
address
her
friend
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
to
send
a
cry
of
pain
and
hopelessness
to
the
of
the
pacific
is
the
use
of
working
at
music
the
simple
truth
is
that
since
i
left
england
i
have
given
it
up
i
am
living
here
on
false
pretences
i
shall
never
care
to
play
the
violin
again
what
sort
of
a
reception
could
i
expect
from
an
english
audience
if
i
took
another
name
of
course
it
would
get
known
who
i
was
and
people
would
just
come
to
stare
at
me
pleasant
thought
and
i
have
utterly
lost
confidence
in
myself
the
difficulties
are
great
even
where
there
is
great
talent
and
i
feel
i
have
nothing
of
the
kind
i
might
toil
for
years
and
should
do
no
good
i
feel
i
am
not
an
artist
i
am
beaten
and
disgraced
there
nothing
left
but
to
cry
and
be
miserable
like
any
other
girl
who
has
lost
her
money
her
hopes
everything
why
do
you
write
to
me
if
you
wait
till
you
get
this
it
will
be
six
or
seven
weeks
before
i
could
possibly
hear
and
a
letter
from
you
would
do
me
so
much
good
some
one
knocked
at
her
door
she
called
and
there
appeared
a
little
boy
the
child
of
her
landlady
who
sometimes
ran
errands
for
her
he
said
that
a
gentleman
was
asking
to
see
her
ein
englander
und
ein
schnurriges
deutsch
ist
das
er
alma
started
up
shut
her
unfinished
letter
in
the
and
looked
anxiously
about
the
room
is
his
name
ask
him
to
give
you
his
name
the
youngster
came
back
with
a
card
and
alma
was
astonished
to
read
the
name
of
felix
dymes
why
she
had
all
but
forgotten
the
existence
how
came
he
here
what
right
had
he
to
call
and
yet
she
was
glad
nay
delighted
happily
she
had
the
shared
with
her
friend
to
herself
this
morning
him
up
here
she
said
to
the
boy
hurriedly
ask
him
to
wait
a
minute
for
me
and
she
escaped
to
make
a
rapid
change
of
dress
for
alma
was
not
like
sibyl
carnaby
in
perpetual
regard
for
personal
finish
she
dressed
carelessly
save
when
the
occasion
demanded
pains
she
liked
the
ease
of
gowns
and
slippers
of
loose
hair
and
free
throat
and
this
taste
had
grown
upon
her
during
the
past
months
but
she
did
not
keep
dymes
waiting
very
long
and
on
her
entrance
he
gazed
at
her
with
very
frank
admiration
frank
too
was
his
greeting
that
of
a
very
old
and
intimate
friend
rather
than
of
a
acquaintance
he
came
straight
from
england
he
said
a
spring
holiday
warranted
by
the
success
of
his
song
which
the
tenor
topham
had
sung
at
st
james
hall
a
few
days
ago
he
had
happened
to
see
miss
leach
who
gave
him
miss
frothingham
address
and
he
could
not
deny
himself
the
pleasure
of
calling
chatting
thus
he
made
himself
comfortable
in
a
chair
and
alma
sat
over
against
him
the
man
was
loud
conceited
vulgar
but
after
all
he
composed
very
sweet
music
which
promised
to
take
the
public
ear
and
he
brought
with
him
a
waft
from
the
happiness
of
old
days
and
how
could
one
expect
small
proprieties
of
a
bohemian
an
artist
alma
began
to
talk
eagerly
joyously
what
are
you
doing
miss
frothingham
fiddling
a
little
but
i
have
been
very
well
can
see
that
yet
in
another
sense
you
look
a
better
than
ever
he
began
to
hum
an
air
glancing
round
the
room
have
a
piano
just
listen
to
this
how
do
you
think
it
will
do
he
hummed
through
a
complete
melody
into
my
head
last
night
wants
rather
sentimental
words
the
kind
of
thing
that
goes
down
with
the
british
public
rather
a
good
air
do
you
think
felix
dymes
had
two
manners
of
conversation
in
a
company
at
all
ceremonious
and
when
it
behoved
him
to
make
an
impression
he
talked
as
the
artist
and
the
expert
in
music
with
many
german
phrases
which
he
pronounced
badly
to
fill
up
the
gaps
in
his
knowledge
his
familiar
stream
of
talk
was
very
different
it
discarded
affectation
and
had
a
directness
a
vigour
which
never
left
one
in
doubt
as
to
his
actual
views
of
life
how
melody
of
any
kind
could
issue
from
a
nature
so
manifestly
ignoble
might
puzzle
the
idealist
alma
who
had
known
a
good
many
musical
people
was
not
troubled
by
this
difficulty
in
her
present
mood
she
submitted
to
the
arrogance
of
success
and
felt
a
pleasure
an
encouragement
in
dymes
bluff
me
try
to
catch
it
on
the
violin
she
said
when
with
nodding
head
and
waving
arm
he
had
hummed
again
through
his
composition
she
succeeded
in
doing
so
and
dymes
raised
his
humming
to
a
sentimental
roar
and
was
vastly
pleased
with
himself
like
to
see
you
in
a
place
like
this
he
said
more
as
if
you
really
meant
to
do
something
do
you
live
here
alone
a
friend
something
peculiar
in
dymes
glance
caused
her
to
add
german
girl
an
art
student
whereat
the
musician
nodded
and
smiled
what
your
idea
come
now
let
talk
about
it
i
wonder
whether
i
could
be
of
any
use
to
you
awfully
glad
if
i
could
alma
was
abashed
stammered
her
vague
projects
and
reddened
under
the
man
observant
eye
here
he
cried
with
his
charming
informality
you
use
to
sing
somebody
told
me
you
had
a
pretty
good
voice
that
was
long
ago
wish
you
let
me
hear
you
no
i
do
sing
at
all
if
it
true
i
want
to
write
a
opera
a
new
sort
of
thing
and
it
struck
me
you
were
just
cut
out
for
that
kind
of
singing
you
have
the
face
and
the
you
know
the
refinement
sort
of
thing
not
easy
to
find
it
a
poor
chance
i
afraid
coming
out
as
a
violinist
half
inclined
to
resent
his
impertinence
yet
subdued
by
the
practical
tone
and
air
of
superior
knowledge
alma
kept
a
grave
face
dymes
crossing
his
legs
went
on
with
talk
of
projects
he
had
in
view
all
intended
to
be
lucrative
he
had
capital
nothing
great
just
a
comfortable
sum
which
he
was
bent
on
using
to
the
best
advantage
his
songs
would
presently
be
bringing
him
in
a
few
hundreds
a
year
so
he
declared
and
his
idea
of
life
was
to
get
as
much
enjoyment
as
possible
without
working
for
it
the
conversation
lasted
for
a
couple
of
hours
dymes
growing
even
more
genial
and
confidential
his
eyes
seldom
moving
from
alma
face
he
said
at
length
rising
very
jolly
to
see
you
again
after
all
this
time
i
shall
be
staying
here
for
a
few
days
you
let
me
call
tomorrow
at
once
glad
and
sorry
to
see
him
go
alma
laughingly
gave
the
desired
permission
when
that
evening
she
looked
at
her
unfinished
letter
it
seemed
such
a
miserable
whine
that
she
tore
it
up
in
annoyance
visit
had
done
her
good
she
felt
if
not
a
renewal
of
hope
at
all
events
the
courage
which
comes
of
revived
spirits
the
next
day
she
awaited
his
arrival
with
a
pleasant
expectation
he
entered
humming
an
air
another
new
composition
which
again
she
caught
from
him
and
played
on
the
violin
do
you
think
i
in
great
vein
just
now
always
am
in
the
spring
and
when
the
weather
fine
i
say
you
looking
much
better
today
decidedly
more
fit
what
do
you
do
here
for
exercise
do
you
go
to
the
englische
garten
come
now
will
you
let
have
a
drive
with
sudden
coldness
alma
excused
herself
the
musician
scrutinised
her
rapidly
bit
his
lip
and
looked
round
to
the
window
but
in
a
moment
he
had
recovered
his
loud
good
humour
hardly
believe
it
but
it
the
plain
truth
that
i
came
all
this
way
just
to
see
you
i
had
thought
of
coming
to
germany
till
i
met
miss
leach
and
heard
about
you
now
i
so
far
i
might
as
well
go
on
into
italy
and
make
a
round
of
it
i
wish
you
were
coming
too
alma
made
no
reply
he
scrutinised
her
as
before
and
his
features
worked
as
if
with
some
emotion
then
abruptly
he
put
a
blunt
question
you
think
people
who
go
in
for
music
art
and
that
kind
of
thing
ought
to
marry
never
thought
about
it
at
all
alma
replied
with
a
careless
laugh
striking
a
finger
across
the
strings
of
the
violin
which
she
held
on
her
lap
generally
told
they
should
pursued
dymes
in
a
voice
which
had
lost
its
noisy
confidence
and
was
a
little
uncertain
it
all
depends
you
know
if
people
mean
by
marriage
the
ordinary
kind
of
thing
of
course
that
the
deuce
but
it
need
be
lots
of
people
marry
nowadays
and
live
in
a
rational
way
no
house
or
bother
of
that
kind
just
going
about
as
they
like
and
having
a
pleasant
reasonable
life
it
easy
enough
with
a
little
money
sometimes
they
a
good
deal
of
help
to
each
other
i
know
people
who
manage
to
be
i
dare
say
said
alma
when
he
paused
all
depends
as
you
say
you
going
on
to
italy
at
once
her
eyes
seemed
to
conceal
amusement
and
there
was
disdain
in
the
setting
of
her
lips
with
audacity
so
incredible
that
it
all
but
made
her
laugh
dymes
not
heeding
her
inquiry
jerked
out
the
personal
application
of
his
abstract
remarks
yes
it
was
a
proposal
of
marriage
marriage
on
the
new
plan
without
cares
or
encumbrance
a
suggestion
rather
than
a
petition
unsentimental
yet
perfectly
serious
as
look
and
tone
proclaimed
much
to
be
said
for
your
views
alma
replied
with
humorous
gravity
i
have
the
least
intention
of
marrying
i
mentioned
it
he
waved
his
hand
as
if
to
overcome
an
unwonted
embarrassment
do
mind
a
bit
hope
we
shall
meet
again
before
long
and
some
day
you
know
you
may
see
the
thing
in
another
light
you
must
think
i
joking
it
rather
a
joke
i
never
was
more
in
earnest
about
anything
believe
me
and
convinced
it
a
good
idea
however
you
know
one
thing
if
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
i
shall
i
think
it
over
your
chances
and
so
on
something
may
suggest
itself
you
not
cut
out
for
everyday
things
try
to
hope
not
but
you
can
take
my
word
for
it
with
this
comforting
assurance
felix
dymes
departed
no
melodrama
a
a
significant
nod
a
loud
humming
as
he
went
downstairs
alma
presently
began
a
new
letter
to
sibyl
carnaby
it
was
written
in
a
cheery
humour
though
touched
by
the
shadow
of
distressful
circumstance
she
told
the
story
of
dymes
visit
and
made
merry
over
it
am
sure
this
is
the
very
newest
thing
in
proposals
though
i
live
in
such
a
dull
lonely
way
it
has
made
me
feel
that
i
am
still
in
touch
with
civilisation
and
really
if
the
worst
come
to
the
worst
but
it
dangerous
to
joke
about
such
things
she
touched
lightly
on
the
facts
of
her
position
afraid
i
have
not
been
doing
very
much
perhaps
this
is
a
fallow
time
with
me
i
may
be
gaining
strength
for
great
achievements
unfortunately
i
have
a
lazy
companion
miss
steinfeld
you
know
her
from
my
last
letter
if
you
got
it
only
pretends
to
work
i
like
her
for
her
thorough
goodness
and
her
intelligence
but
she
is
just
a
little
and
so
not
exactly
the
companion
i
need
her
idea
just
now
is
that
we
both
need
change
and
she
wants
me
to
go
with
her
to
bregenz
on
the
bodensee
perhaps
i
shall
when
the
weather
gets
hot
it
had
surprised
her
to
be
told
by
felix
dymes
that
he
obtained
her
address
at
munich
from
miss
leach
for
the
only
person
in
england
to
whom
she
had
yet
made
known
her
departure
from
leipzig
was
her
speak
of
her
how
they
might
her
acquaintances
in
london
still
took
trouble
to
inform
themselves
of
her
movements
perhaps
the
very
completeness
of
the
catastrophe
in
which
she
was
involved
told
in
her
favour
possibly
she
excited
much
more
interest
than
could
ever
have
attached
to
her
whilst
her
name
was
respected
there
was
new
life
in
the
thought
she
wrote
briefly
to
dora
leach
giving
an
account
of
herself
which
though
essentially
misleading
was
not
composed
in
a
spirit
of
conscious
falsehood
for
all
her
vanity
alma
had
never
aimed
at
effect
by
practice
of
deliberate
insincerities
miss
leach
was
informed
that
her
friend
could
not
find
much
time
for
correspondence
am
living
in
the
atmosphere
of
art
and
striving
patiently
some
day
you
shall
hear
of
me
and
when
the
letter
was
posted
alma
mused
long
on
the
effect
it
would
produce
with
the
distinguished
violinist
the
friend
of
herr
wilenski
spoken
of
to
frothingham
she
had
as
yet
held
no
communication
and
through
the
days
of
early
summer
she
continued
to
neglect
her
music
indolence
grew
upon
her
sometimes
she
spent
the
whole
day
in
a
seated
or
reclining
with
a
book
in
her
hand
or
totally
unoccupied
sometimes
the
military
bands
in
the
public
gardens
tempted
her
to
walk
a
little
or
she
strolled
with
miss
steinfeld
through
the
picture
galleries
occasionally
they
made
short
excursions
into
the
country
the
art
student
had
acquaintances
in
munich
but
did
not
see
much
of
them
and
they
were
not
the
kind
of
people
with
whom
alma
cared
to
associate
in
july
it
was
decided
that
they
should
go
for
a
few
weeks
to
bregenz
their
health
called
for
the
change
which
as
miss
steinfeld
knew
of
a
homely
could
be
had
at
small
expense
before
their
departure
the
art
student
was
away
for
a
few
days
and
to
relieve
the
dreariness
of
an
existence
which
was
becoming
burdensome
alma
went
out
alone
one
afternoon
purposing
a
trip
by
to
the
gardens
at
nymphenburg
she
walked
to
the
stiglmeyerplatz
where
the
tram
starts
and
there
stood
waiting
a
carriage
drove
past
with
a
sound
of
english
voices
which
drew
her
attention
she
saw
three
children
a
lady
and
a
gentleman
the
looked
at
her
and
she
recognised
cyrus
redgrave
whether
he
knew
her
face
seemed
uncertain
hoping
to
escape
unobserved
she
turned
quickly
and
walked
a
few
yards
before
she
faced
round
again
a
quick
footstep
approached
her
and
the
next
moment
redgrave
stood
hat
in
hand
courteously
claiming
her
acquaintance
thought
i
could
not
possibly
be
mistaken
the
carriage
having
stopped
for
him
to
alight
was
driving
away
is
my
sister
and
her
children
said
redgrave
when
he
had
warmly
shaken
hands
and
expressed
his
pleasure
at
the
meeting
never
met
her
her
husband
is
in
india
and
you
see
me
in
full
domesticity
this
morning
i
posted
a
note
to
you
of
course
you
have
received
it
yet
alma
did
her
best
to
behave
with
dignity
in
any
case
it
would
have
been
trying
to
encounter
such
a
man
as
redgrave
wealthy
elegant
a
figure
in
society
who
must
necessarily
regard
her
as
banished
from
polite
circles
and
in
her
careless
costume
she
felt
more
than
abashed
for
the
first
time
a
sense
of
degradation
of
social
inferiority
threatened
to
overwhelm
her
did
you
know
my
address
she
asked
with
an
involuntary
imitation
of
hauteur
made
pathetic
by
the
flush
on
her
face
and
the
lingering
frothingham
kindly
gave
it
you
were
walking
this
way
i
think
my
sister
is
living
at
stuttgart
and
i
happened
to
come
over
just
in
time
to
act
as
her
courier
on
a
journey
to
salzburg
we
got
here
yesterday
and
go
on
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
i
dropped
you
a
note
asking
if
i
might
call
have
you
seen
mamma
lately
asked
alma
barely
attentive
to
the
explanations
he
was
giving
her
london
quite
by
chance
in
fact
it
was
at
waterloo
station
mrs
frothingham
was
starting
for
the
country
and
i
happened
to
be
going
to
wimbledon
i
told
her
i
might
possibly
see
you
on
my
way
through
munich
alma
began
to
recover
herself
that
cyrus
redgrave
should
still
take
an
interest
in
her
was
decidedly
more
gratifying
than
the
eccentric
compliment
of
felix
dymes
she
strove
to
forget
the
humiliation
of
having
been
found
standing
in
a
public
place
waiting
for
a
in
redgrave
manner
no
change
was
perceptible
unless
indeed
he
spoke
with
more
cordiality
which
must
be
prompted
by
kind
feeling
their
acquaintance
covered
only
a
year
or
two
and
had
scarcely
amounted
to
what
passes
for
friendship
but
redgrave
seemed
oblivious
of
late
unpleasant
events
glad
you
did
call
unexpectedly
she
said
trying
to
strike
a
light
note
a
student
now
no
longer
an
amateur
and
live
as
a
student
must
much
the
better
i
a
natural
bohemian
myself
and
like
nothing
so
well
as
to
disregard
ceremony
and
that
the
very
reason
why
i
ran
away
from
my
sister
to
speak
to
you
i
knew
you
would
dislike
formalities
i
afraid
i
was
rather
glad
than
otherwise
to
escape
we
have
been
taking
the
children
for
a
drive
charming
little
rascals
but
for
the
moment
my
domestic
instincts
are
satisfied
frothingham
mentioned
that
you
were
living
with
a
friend
an
art
student
go
away
for
a
holiday
in
a
day
or
two
said
alma
more
at
her
ease
bregenz
do
you
know
it
name
only
you
go
in
a
day
or
two
i
wish
you
would
let
me
know
your
address
there
he
added
with
frank
friendliness
go
on
with
my
sister
to
salzburg
and
then
turn
off
on
my
own
account
i
might
be
able
to
pass
your
way
and
i
should
so
much
like
to
have
a
talk
with
you
a
real
talk
about
music
and
all
sorts
of
things
did
i
ever
tell
you
of
my
little
place
at
riva
head
of
lake
garda
cosy
little
nook
but
i
not
there
very
often
i
half
thought
of
going
for
a
week
or
two
quietness
quite
cool
there
by
the
lake
but
i
really
must
try
to
see
you
at
bregenz
do
let
me
he
begged
it
as
a
favour
a
privilege
and
alma
without
hesitation
told
him
where
she
would
be
living
a
few
weeks
oh
then
i
shall
make
a
point
of
coming
that
way
you
not
working
too
hard
i
hope
i
know
you
do
do
things
by
halves
when
i
first
heard
you
were
going
in
seriously
for
music
i
said
to
myself
another
great
violinist
the
listener
reddened
with
delight
her
step
became
elastic
she
carried
her
head
gallantly
and
feared
not
the
glances
redgrave
cast
at
her
have
learnt
not
to
talk
about
myself
she
said
bestowing
a
smile
upon
him
the
first
bad
habit
to
be
overcome
by
the
amateur
converted
an
axiom
worth
putting
into
print
for
the
benefit
of
all
and
sundry
now
i
must
say
goodbye
that
fellow
yonder
will
take
me
back
to
the
domesticities
he
hailed
an
empty
carriage
shall
meet
again
among
the
mountains
alma
continued
to
walk
along
the
nymphenburg
road
unconscious
of
external
things
the
tram
for
which
she
had
been
waiting
passed
by
she
no
longer
cared
to
go
out
into
the
country
it
was
enough
to
keep
moving
in
the
bright
sunshine
and
to
think
her
thoughts
no
people
had
by
no
means
forgotten
her
whilst
she
was
allowing
herself
to
fall
into
gloom
and
indolence
her
acquaintances
it
was
evident
made
her
a
constant
subject
of
talk
of
speculation
just
what
she
had
desired
but
had
lost
courage
to
believe
they
expected
great
things
of
her
her
personal
popularity
and
her
talents
had
prevailed
against
the
most
prejudicial
circumstance
people
did
not
think
of
her
as
the
daughter
of
bennet
frothingham
unless
to
contrast
the
hopefulness
of
her
future
with
the
black
calamity
that
lay
behind
she
waxed
philosophical
how
everything
in
this
world
tends
to
good
at
her
father
death
she
had
mourned
bitterly
it
had
struck
her
to
the
heart
his
imprudence
she
could
never
use
even
in
thought
a
harsher
word
pained
more
than
it
shamed
her
and
not
a
day
passed
but
she
sorrowed
over
the
dishonour
that
darkened
his
memory
yet
were
not
these
woes
and
disasters
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
for
in
prosperity
what
would
she
ever
have
become
nothing
less
than
being
thrown
out
into
the
world
could
have
given
her
the
impulse
needed
to
realise
a
high
ambition
another
great
violinist
how
sincerely
how
inspiringly
it
was
said
and
alma
feet
had
brought
her
home
again
before
she
paused
to
reflect
that
for
all
purposes
of
ambition
the
past
had
been
utterly
wasted
never
mind
after
her
return
from
bregenz
on
her
table
lay
redgrave
note
a
very
civil
line
or
two
requesting
permission
to
call
there
was
another
letter
which
came
from
her
frothingham
said
that
she
had
been
about
to
write
for
several
days
but
all
sorts
of
disagreeable
business
had
hindered
her
even
now
she
could
only
write
hurriedly
in
the
last
fortnight
she
had
had
to
go
twice
to
london
really
i
think
i
shall
be
obliged
to
go
and
live
there
again
for
a
time
so
many
things
have
to
be
seen
to
it
might
be
best
perhaps
if
i
took
a
small
flat
i
was
going
to
say
however
that
the
last
time
i
went
up
i
met
redgrave
and
we
had
quite
a
long
talk
about
he
was
most
sincerely
interested
in
your
future
indeed
it
quite
surprised
me
for
i
will
confess
that
i
had
never
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
him
i
fancy
he
suffered
his
behaviour
to
me
was
that
of
a
gentleman
very
different
from
that
of
some
people
i
could
name
but
it
was
he
spoke
of
most
he
said
he
was
shortly
going
to
germany
and
begged
me
to
let
him
have
your
address
and
really
i
saw
no
harm
in
it
he
may
call
upon
you
if
so
let
me
hear
all
about
it
for
it
will
interest
me
very
much
alma
had
half
a
mind
to
reply
at
once
but
on
reflection
decided
to
wait
after
all
redgrave
might
not
keep
his
promise
of
coming
to
see
her
at
bregenz
and
in
that
event
a
very
brief
report
of
what
had
happened
would
suffice
but
she
felt
sure
that
he
meant
to
come
and
decidedly
she
hoped
it
why
she
was
content
to
leave
a
rosy
vagueness
chapter
alma
and
her
german
friend
silently
agreed
in
foreseeing
that
they
would
not
live
together
much
longer
miss
steinfeld
eager
at
first
to
talk
english
was
relapsing
into
her
native
tongue
and
as
alma
lazily
avoided
german
they
conversed
in
different
languages
each
with
a
sprinkling
of
foreign
phrase
the
english
girl
might
have
allied
herself
with
a
far
worse
companion
for
in
spite
of
defects
which
resembled
alma
own
vagueness
of
purpose
infirmity
of
will
miss
steinfeld
had
a
fund
of
moral
principle
which
made
her
talk
wholesome
and
her
aspirations
an
influence
for
good
she
imagined
herself
in
love
with
an
artist
whom
she
had
seen
only
two
or
three
times
and
no
strain
could
have
been
more
exalted
than
that
in
which
she
confided
her
romance
to
the
sympathetic
alma
sympathetic
that
is
within
her
limits
for
miss
frothingham
had
never
been
in
love
and
rarely
indulged
a
mood
of
sentiment
her
characteristic
emotions
she
of
course
did
not
reveal
save
unconsciously
and
miss
steinfeld
knew
nothing
of
the
tragic
circumstances
which
explained
her
friend
solitude
in
the
first
days
at
bregenz
they
felt
a
renewal
of
pleasure
in
each
other
society
alma
spirits
were
much
improved
she
enjoyed
the
scenery
and
lived
in
the
open
air
there
was
climbing
of
mountains
the
pfander
with
its
reward
of
noble
outlook
and
the
easier
gebhardsberg
with
its
hanging
woods
there
was
boating
on
the
lake
and
rambling
along
its
shores
with
rest
and
refreshment
at
some
gartenwithschaft
miss
steinfeld
whose
reading
and
intelligence
were
superior
to
alma
liked
to
explore
the
roman
ruins
and
linger
in
the
museum
alma
could
not
long
keep
up
a
pretence
of
interest
in
the
relics
of
brigantium
but
she
said
one
day
with
a
smile
know
someone
who
would
enjoy
this
kind
of
thing
an
englishman
very
learned
inquired
her
friend
significantly
no
neither
old
nor
young
a
strange
man
rather
interesting
i
a
good
mind
she
added
mischievously
send
him
a
photograph
yourself
dear
no
he
would
care
for
that
a
view
of
the
and
in
her
mood
of
frolic
she
acted
upon
the
thought
she
purchased
two
or
three
views
had
them
done
up
for
post
and
addressed
them
to
harvey
rolfe
esq
at
the
metropolitan
club
for
his
private
address
she
could
not
remember
but
the
club
remained
in
her
mind
from
sibyl
talk
of
it
when
the
packet
was
gone
of
course
she
regretted
having
sent
it
more
likely
than
not
rolfe
considered
himself
to
have
ended
all
acquaintance
with
the
disgraced
family
and
if
he
recognised
her
handwriting
would
just
throw
the
photographs
aside
let
him
it
mattered
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
when
a
week
had
passed
the
novelty
of
things
wore
off
the
friends
began
to
wander
apart
miss
steinfeld
made
acquaintances
in
the
and
alma
drifted
into
solitude
at
the
end
of
a
fortnight
she
was
tired
of
everything
wished
to
go
away
thought
longingly
of
england
it
was
plain
that
redgrave
would
not
come
he
had
never
seriously
meant
it
his
was
a
mere
civility
to
get
rid
of
her
in
the
street
why
had
he
troubled
to
inquire
about
her
at
all
of
course
it
did
matter
nothing
mattered
but
if
ever
she
met
him
again
alma
tried
her
features
in
expression
of
cold
scornfulness
on
the
next
day
as
she
was
returning
from
an
idle
walk
with
her
friend
along
the
lindau
road
redgrave
met
them
he
was
dressed
as
she
had
never
seen
him
in
flannels
with
a
white
necktie
loosely
knotted
and
a
straw
hat
not
till
he
had
come
near
enough
to
salute
did
she
recognise
him
he
looked
ten
years
younger
they
talked
as
if
the
meeting
were
of
daily
occurrence
redgrave
addressed
himself
to
miss
steinfeld
as
often
as
to
alma
and
showed
a
graceful
command
of
decorous
commonplace
he
had
arrived
early
this
morning
had
put
up
at
the
oesterreichischer
hof
was
already
delighted
with
brogenz
did
miss
steinfeld
devote
herself
to
landscape
had
she
done
anything
here
had
miss
frothingham
brought
her
violin
they
strolled
pleasantly
to
the
hafen
promenade
and
parted
at
length
with
assurances
of
meeting
again
as
if
definite
appointment
were
needless
is
my
idea
of
the
english
gentleman
said
miss
steinfeld
afterwards
think
i
should
have
taken
him
for
a
lord
no
doubt
he
is
very
rich
pretty
well
off
alma
replied
with
assumed
indifference
thousand
pounds
a
year
i
dare
say
thousand
and
married
parliament
i
suppose
what
does
he
do
amuses
himself
each
became
occupied
with
her
thoughts
alma
were
so
agreeable
that
miss
steinfeld
observing
her
naturally
fell
into
romantic
speculation
redgrave
easily
contrived
that
his
next
walk
should
be
with
miss
frothingham
alone
he
overtook
her
next
morning
soon
after
she
had
left
the
house
and
they
rambled
in
the
gebhardsberg
direction
let
us
have
the
promised
talk
he
began
at
a
favourable
moment
been
thinking
about
you
all
the
time
you
go
to
your
place
on
lake
garda
just
to
look
at
it
and
get
it
put
in
order
i
hope
to
be
there
again
before
long
you
did
doubt
i
should
come
left
it
uncertain
be
sure
life
is
uncertain
but
i
should
have
been
desperately
disappointed
if
i
had
found
you
here
there
are
so
many
things
to
be
said
about
going
in
for
music
as
a
profession
you
have
the
talent
you
have
the
physical
strength
i
think
his
eye
flattered
her
from
head
to
foot
to
be
a
great
artist
one
must
have
more
than
technical
qualifications
it
the
soul
that
must
be
developed
alma
laughed
know
it
and
what
is
your
receipt
for
developing
the
soul
redgrave
paused
in
his
walk
smiling
he
gave
a
twist
to
his
moustache
and
appeared
to
meditate
profoundly
soul
well
it
has
a
priggish
sound
let
us
say
the
character
and
that
is
developed
through
experience
of
life
getting
it
you
in
the
company
of
miss
steinfeld
i
afraid
that
wo
carry
you
very
far
experience
means
emotion
certainly
for
a
woman
believe
me
you
have
begun
to
live
yet
you
may
practise
on
your
violin
day
and
night
and
it
wo
profit
you
until
you
have
alma
was
growing
serious
these
phrases
harmonised
well
enough
with
her
own
insubstantial
thoughts
and
notions
when
preparing
to
escape
from
england
she
had
used
much
the
same
language
but
after
all
what
did
it
mean
what
in
particular
did
cyrus
redgrave
mean
with
his
expressive
eyes
and
languid
earnest
tone
will
say
that
a
girl
has
few
opportunities
true
thanks
to
her
enslavement
by
society
care
nothing
for
society
alma
interposed
i
like
the
sound
of
that
defiance
it
has
the
right
ring
a
man
has
often
the
pleasure
of
hearing
that
from
a
woman
he
can
respect
it
easy
of
course
to
defy
the
laws
of
a
world
one
does
belong
to
but
you
who
are
a
queen
in
your
circle
and
may
throne
at
any
moment
in
a
wider
sphere
it
means
much
when
you
refuse
to
bow
down
before
the
vulgar
idols
to
be
fettered
by
superstitions
his
aim
was
dark
to
her
but
she
tasted
the
compliment
which
ignored
her
social
eclipse
redgrave
conversation
generally
kept
on
the
prosaic
levels
studiously
polite
or
suavely
cynical
it
was
a
new
experience
to
see
him
borne
on
a
wave
of
rhetoric
yet
not
borne
away
for
he
spoke
with
an
ease
a
which
to
older
ears
would
have
suggested
skill
rather
than
feeling
he
had
nothing
of
the
ardour
of
youth
his
poise
and
deliberation
were
quite
in
keeping
with
the
two
score
years
that
subtly
graved
his
visage
the
passions
in
him
were
sportive
as
though
together
with
his
brain
they
had
grown
to
a
ripe
worldliness
he
inspired
no
distrust
his
good
nature
seemed
he
had
the
air
of
one
who
lavishes
disinterested
counsel
and
ever
so
little
exalts
himself
with
his
facile
exuberance
of
speech
have
seen
much
of
artists
known
them
intimately
and
studied
their
lives
one
and
all
they
date
their
success
from
some
passionate
experience
from
a
cold
and
conventional
existence
can
come
nothing
but
cold
and
conventional
art
you
left
england
broke
away
from
the
common
routine
from
the
artificial
and
the
respectable
that
was
an
indispensable
first
step
and
i
have
told
you
how
i
applauded
it
but
you
can
not
stop
at
this
i
begin
to
fear
for
you
there
is
a
convention
of
unconventionality
poor
quarters
hard
life
stinted
pleasures
all
that
kind
of
thing
i
fear
its
effect
upon
you
choice
have
i
exclaimed
alma
moved
to
familiar
frankness
i
poor
i
must
live
poorly
he
smiled
graciously
upon
her
and
raised
his
hand
almost
as
though
he
would
touch
her
with
reassuring
kindness
but
it
was
only
to
stroke
his
trimmed
beard
you
have
a
choice
believe
me
came
his
airy
answer
no
harm
in
poverty
that
does
last
too
long
you
may
have
profited
by
it
it
is
an
experience
but
now
do
let
us
walk
so
far
as
to
tire
you
yes
we
will
turn
variety
of
life
travel
all
sorts
of
joys
and
satisfactions
these
are
the
things
you
need
if
they
are
not
within
my
reach
she
asked
without
looking
at
him
he
disregarded
her
question
friend
carnaby
has
taken
a
long
flight
the
monosyllable
was
dropped
alma
walked
with
her
eyes
on
the
ground
trailing
her
sunshade
did
think
she
had
much
taste
for
travel
but
you
know
her
so
much
better
than
i
do
is
enjoying
herself
said
alma
need
for
to
go
so
far
down
yonder
he
nodded
southward
was
thinking
the
other
day
of
the
different
kinds
of
pleasure
one
gets
from
scenery
in
different
parts
of
the
world
i
have
seen
the
tropics
they
left
me
very
much
where
i
was
intellectually
it
the
human
associations
of
natural
beauty
that
count
you
have
no
desire
to
go
to
the
islands
of
the
pacific
ca
say
that
i
have
course
not
the
springs
of
art
are
in
the
old
world
among
the
vines
and
the
olives
one
hears
a
voice
i
must
really
try
to
give
you
some
idea
of
my
little
place
at
riva
he
began
a
playful
description
long
but
never
tedious
alluring
yet
without
enthusiasm
a
dreamy
suggestion
of
refined
delights
and
luxuries
have
another
place
in
the
pyrenees
to
suit
another
mood
and
not
long
ago
i
was
sorely
tempted
by
the
offer
of
a
house
not
far
from
antioch
in
the
valley
of
the
orontes
a
house
built
by
an
englishman
charming
place
and
so
entirely
off
the
beaten
track
is
there
a
fascination
in
the
thought
of
living
near
antioch
well
away
from
bores
and
philistines
no
grundy
with
her
clinking
i
dare
say
the
house
is
still
to
be
oh
do
tell
me
something
about
your
friend
fraulein
steinfeld
is
she
in
earnest
will
she
do
anything
his
eloquence
was
at
an
end
thenceforward
he
talked
of
common
things
in
unemotional
language
and
when
alma
parted
from
him
it
was
with
a
sense
of
being
tired
and
disappointed
on
the
following
day
she
did
not
see
him
at
all
he
could
not
have
left
bregenz
for
of
course
he
would
have
let
her
know
she
thought
of
him
incessantly
reviewing
all
his
talk
turning
over
this
and
that
ambiguous
phrase
asking
herself
whether
he
meant
much
or
little
it
was
natural
that
she
should
compare
and
contrast
his
behaviour
with
that
of
felix
dymes
if
his
motive
were
not
the
same
why
did
he
seek
her
society
and
if
it
were
if
at
length
he
spoke
out
summing
his
hints
in
the
plain
offer
of
all
those
opportunities
she
lacked
a
brilliant
temptation
to
leave
the
world
as
alma
frothingham
and
to
return
to
it
as
cyrus
redgrave
but
in
that
event
what
of
her
musical
ambitions
he
spoke
of
her
art
as
the
supreme
concern
to
which
all
else
must
be
subordinate
and
surely
that
was
his
meaning
when
he
threw
scorn
upon
and
philistines
why
should
the
fact
of
his
wealth
interfere
with
her
progress
as
an
artist
possibly
on
the
other
hand
he
did
not
intend
that
she
should
follow
a
professional
career
can
not
one
be
a
great
artist
without
standing
on
public
platforms
was
it
his
lordly
thought
to
foster
her
talents
for
his
own
delectation
and
that
of
the
few
privileged
her
brain
grew
confused
with
interpreting
and
picturing
but
once
more
she
had
made
an
advance
in
she
could
await
the
next
meeting
with
a
confidence
and
pride
very
unlike
her
sensations
in
the
stiglmeyerplatz
at
munich
it
took
place
on
the
second
day
this
time
redgrave
did
not
wait
upon
accident
he
sent
a
note
begging
that
he
might
have
the
pleasure
of
another
talk
with
her
he
would
call
at
a
certain
hour
and
take
his
chance
of
finding
her
at
home
when
he
presented
himself
alma
was
sitting
in
the
common
room
of
the
with
two
german
ladies
they
in
a
few
minutes
withdrew
and
familiar
conversation
became
possible
as
the
windows
stood
open
and
there
were
chairs
upon
the
balcony
redgrave
shortly
proposed
a
move
in
that
direction
they
sat
together
for
half
an
hour
when
redgrave
took
his
leave
it
was
without
shaking
of
hands
with
no
he
smiled
he
murmured
civilities
alma
neither
smiled
nor
spoke
she
was
pale
and
profoundly
agitated
so
this
was
his
meaning
made
plain
enough
at
last
though
with
the
most
graceful
phrasing
childish
vanity
and
ignorance
had
forbidden
her
to
dream
of
such
an
issue
she
had
not
for
a
moment
grasped
the
significance
to
a
man
of
the
world
of
the
ruin
and
disgrace
fallen
upon
her
family
in
theory
she
might
call
herself
an
exile
from
the
polite
world
none
the
less
did
she
imagine
herself
still
illumined
by
the
social
halo
guarded
by
the
divinity
which
doth
hedge
a
member
of
the
class
was
she
not
a
lady
and
who
had
ever
dared
to
offer
a
lady
an
insult
such
as
this
minor
actresses
the
inferior
sort
of
governess
must
naturally
be
on
their
guard
their
insecurity
was
traditional
novel
and
drama
represented
their
moral
vicissitudes
but
a
lady
who
had
lived
in
a
great
house
with
many
servants
who
had
founded
an
amateur
quartet
society
the
hem
of
whose
garment
had
never
been
touched
with
irreverent
finger
could
stand
in
peril
of
such
indignity
not
till
now
had
she
called
to
mind
the
forewarnings
of
sibyl
carnaby
which
at
the
time
of
hearing
them
she
did
not
at
all
understand
said
sibyl
approach
her
with
strange
ideas
this
she
might
have
applied
to
the
grotesque
proposal
as
it
seemed
to
her
of
felix
dymes
or
to
the
risk
of
being
tempted
into
premature
publicity
by
a
business
offer
from
some
not
very
respectable
impresario
what
sibyl
meant
was
now
only
too
clear
but
how
little
could
carnaby
have
imagined
that
her
warning
would
be
justified
by
one
of
her
own
friends
by
a
man
of
wealth
and
consideration
she
durst
not
leave
the
house
for
fear
of
encountering
redgrave
who
if
they
crossed
by
chance
might
fancy
she
invited
another
meeting
she
dreaded
the
observation
of
women
especially
of
miss
steinfeld
the
only
retreat
was
her
bedroom
and
here
she
secluded
herself
till
at
this
meal
she
must
needs
face
the
company
or
incur
remark
she
tried
to
return
her
friend
smile
with
the
ordinary
unconcern
after
dinner
there
was
no
avoiding
miss
steinfeld
whose
air
of
extreme
discretion
showed
that
she
had
an
inkling
of
events
and
awaited
confidences
redgrave
has
gone
he
called
to
say
goodbye
irritated
by
revolting
against
a
misinterpretation
which
would
injure
her
vanity
though
it
was
not
likely
to
aim
at
her
honour
alma
had
recourse
to
fiction
daresay
you
guess
yes
and
i
refused
miss
steinfeld
was
puzzled
it
did
not
astonish
her
that
a
girl
should
reject
ten
thousand
pounds
per
annum
for
that
she
was
too
but
she
had
thought
it
beyond
doubt
that
alma
heart
was
engaged
here
it
had
seemed
to
her
was
the
explanation
of
a
mystery
attaching
to
this
original
young
englishwoman
unhoped
the
brilliant
lover
the
secretly
beloved
had
sought
her
in
her
retirement
and
after
all
it
was
a
mistake
do
care
for
him
a
bit
alma
went
on
had
to
be
got
over
and
done
with
that
was
all
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
in
childhood
she
had
told
falsehoods
freely
but
with
the
necessity
for
that
kind
of
thing
the
habit
had
fallen
away
solace
however
was
at
hand
for
the
german
girl
looked
at
her
with
a
new
interest
a
new
sympathy
which
alma
readily
construed
as
wonder
and
admiration
if
not
gentle
envy
to
have
refused
an
offer
of
marriage
from
a
handsome
man
of
great
wealth
might
be
counted
for
glory
and
alma
momentary
shame
yielded
to
a
gratification
which
put
her
outwardly
at
ease
the
restless
night
brought
torment
of
the
mind
and
harassed
spirits
redgrave
proposal
echoed
in
the
vacant
chambers
of
her
life
sounding
no
longer
an
affront
but
an
allurement
why
indeed
had
she
repelled
it
so
unthinkingly
it
did
not
necessarily
mean
scandal
he
had
not
invited
her
to
open
defiance
of
the
world
can
absolutely
trust
me
i
am
discretion
itself
all
resources
are
at
my
command
why
had
she
rejected
with
scorn
and
horror
what
was
perhaps
her
great
opportunity
the
one
hope
of
her
struggling
and
sinking
ambition
she
had
lost
faith
in
herself
in
her
power
to
overcome
circumstances
not
yet
in
her
talent
in
her
artistic
birthright
redgrave
would
have
made
her
path
smooth
promise
you
a
great
reputation
in
two
or
three
years
time
and
without
disgrace
without
shadow
of
suspicion
it
would
all
be
managed
he
declared
so
very
easily
for
what
alternative
had
she
rebuffed
him
redgrave
sagacity
had
guided
him
well
up
to
a
certain
point
but
it
had
lost
sight
of
one
thing
essential
to
the
success
of
his
scheme
perhaps
because
he
was
forty
years
of
age
perhaps
because
he
had
so
often
come
and
seen
and
conquered
perhaps
because
he
made
too
low
an
estimate
of
bennet
frothingham
daughter
he
simply
overlooked
sentimental
considerations
it
was
a
great
and
a
fatal
oversight
he
went
far
in
his
calculated
appeal
to
alma
vanity
had
he
but
credited
her
with
softer
passions
and
given
himself
the
trouble
to
play
upon
them
he
would
not
at
all
events
have
suffered
so
sudden
a
defeat
men
of
redgrave
stamp
grow
careless
and
just
at
the
time
of
life
when
for
various
causes
the
art
which
conceals
art
has
become
indispensable
he
did
not
flatter
himself
that
alma
was
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
him
and
here
his
calm
maturity
served
him
to
his
own
defect
of
ardour
he
was
blinded
by
habit
after
all
the
affair
had
little
consequence
it
had
only
suggested
itself
after
the
meeting
in
munich
and
perhaps
he
said
to
himself
all
things
considered
the
event
was
just
as
well
but
alma
felt
the
double
insult
to
her
worldly
honour
to
her
womanhood
the
man
had
not
even
made
pretence
of
loving
her
and
this
whilst
it
embittered
her
disappointment
strengthened
her
to
cast
from
her
mind
the
baser
temptation
marriage
she
would
have
accepted
though
doubtless
with
becoming
hesitancy
the
offer
could
not
have
been
made
without
one
word
of
tenderness
for
cyrus
redgrave
was
another
than
felix
dymes
and
she
had
not
felt
it
impossible
to
wed
this
polished
capitalist
out
of
the
tumult
of
her
feelings
as
another
day
went
by
issued
at
length
that
one
simple
and
avowable
sense
of
disappointment
she
had
grasped
the
prize
and
heated
her
imagination
in
regarding
it
had
overcome
natural
reluctances
objections
personal
and
moral
was
ready
to
sit
down
and
write
to
frothingham
the
splendid
startling
announcement
and
here
she
idled
in
her
bedroom
desolate
hopeless
wishing
she
had
courage
to
steal
down
at
night
to
the
waters
of
the
bodensee
and
end
it
all
on
the
third
day
she
returned
to
munich
having
said
farewell
to
her
friend
who
was
quite
prepared
for
the
parting
from
munich
she
proceeded
to
leipzig
and
there
entered
again
the
family
circle
of
the
gassners
she
had
no
intention
of
staying
for
very
long
the
pretence
of
musical
study
could
not
be
kept
up
but
her
next
step
was
quite
uncertain
a
fortnight
later
frothingham
wrote
thus
am
sending
you
on
a
letter
which
if
i
am
not
mistaken
comes
from
rolfe
do
tell
me
if
i
am
right
odd
that
he
should
write
to
you
if
it
is
he
you
have
not
told
me
yet
whether
you
saw
redgrave
again
but
i
see
that
you
do
care
much
and
perhaps
it
is
as
well
the
forwarded
letter
had
been
originally
addressed
to
the
care
of
mrs
frothingham
and
alma
at
a
glance
recognised
harvey
rolfe
writing
he
dated
from
london
was
he
mistaken
he
began
in
thinking
that
certain
photographs
from
bregenz
had
come
to
him
by
miss
kindness
for
his
part
he
had
spent
june
in
a
ramble
in
france
chiefly
by
the
dordogne
and
through
a
strange
interesting
bit
of
called
la
double
hardly
know
how
i
got
there
and
i
shall
not
worry
you
by
writing
any
account
of
the
expedition
but
at
a
miserable
village
called
la
roche
chalais
where
i
had
a
most
indigestible
supper
and
a
bed
unworthy
of
the
name
i
managed
to
fall
ill
and
quite
seriously
thought
ah
here
is
the
end
it
has
to
come
somewhere
and
why
not
on
a
at
la
roche
chalais
a
mistake
i
am
here
again
wasting
life
as
strenuously
as
ever
would
you
let
me
hear
from
you
i
should
think
it
a
great
addition
to
your
kindness
in
sending
the
views
and
so
with
every
good
wish
he
remained
having
nothing
better
to
do
alma
got
out
a
map
of
france
and
searched
for
la
roche
chalais
but
the
place
was
too
insignificant
to
be
marked
on
the
morrow
being
still
without
occupation
she
answered
letter
and
in
quite
a
playful
vein
she
had
no
time
to
correspond
with
people
who
their
lives
to
her
life
was
a
serious
matter
enough
but
he
knew
nothing
of
the
laborious
side
of
a
existence
and
probably
doubted
its
reality
as
an
afterthought
she
thanked
him
gravely
for
his
letter
and
hoped
that
some
day
when
she
had
really
something
they
might
meet
and
renew
their
friendship
chapter
on
an
afternoon
in
september
harvey
rolfe
spent
half
an
hour
at
a
certain
london
bookseller
turning
over
books
that
dealt
with
the
theory
and
practice
of
elementary
education
two
or
three
of
them
he
selected
and
ordered
to
be
sent
to
a
lady
at
gunnersbury
on
his
way
out
he
came
upon
an
acquaintance
making
a
purchase
in
another
department
of
the
shop
it
was
some
months
since
he
had
seen
cecil
morphew
who
looked
in
indifferent
health
and
in
his
dress
came
near
to
shabbiness
they
passed
out
together
morphew
carrying
an
enwrapped
volume
which
he
gave
rolfe
to
understand
was
a
birthday
present
for
the
elder
man
resisted
his
inclination
to
joke
and
asked
how
things
were
going
on
the
same
as
usual
except
that
her
father
is
in
very
bad
health
it
brutal
but
i
wish
he
would
die
what
one
driven
to
you
see
and
anyone
but
you
who
know
me
would
set
me
down
as
a
selfish
calculating
beast
ca
help
it
i
had
rather
have
her
will
you
come
in
here
with
me
i
want
to
buy
some
pyrogallic
acid
in
the
street
again
morphew
mentioned
that
he
had
taken
up
photography
gives
me
something
to
do
and
it
takes
me
out
into
the
open
air
this
beastly
town
is
the
ruin
of
me
in
every
come
to
my
rooms
for
an
hour
will
you
i
show
you
some
attempts
i
only
just
tried
my
hand
at
developing
and
it
a
long
time
since
we
had
a
talk
they
made
for
a
chelsea
omnibus
and
mounted
thought
you
were
never
in
town
at
this
time
morphew
resumed
want
to
get
away
but
ca
afford
it
devilish
with
me
i
must
have
a
bicycle
with
that
and
the
camera
i
may
just
manage
to
live
often
there
seems
little
enough
to
live
tripcony
oh
tripcony
a
damned
swindler
i
given
him
up
speculation
quite
so
simple
as
i
imagined
i
made
a
couple
of
hundred
though
yes
and
lost
nearly
three
the
young
man
laugh
was
less
pleasant
to
hear
than
formerly
altogether
rolfe
observed
in
him
a
decline
a
loss
of
refinement
as
well
as
of
vitality
do
you
go
into
the
country
he
said
a
cottage
and
grow
cabbages
dig
for
three
hours
a
day
it
would
do
you
no
end
of
good
course
it
would
i
wish
i
had
the
courage
going
to
spend
the
winter
in
wales
said
harvey
place
in
carnarvonshire
mountains
and
sea
come
along
with
me
and
get
the
mephitis
blown
out
of
you
you
got
town
disease
fever
jove
i
think
of
it
replied
the
other
with
a
strange
look
of
eagerness
i
do
know
whether
i
can
no
i
ca
be
sure
but
i
try
holds
you
i
like
to
be
near
you
know
to
and
then
all
sorts
of
difficulties
morphew
had
his
lodgings
at
present
in
a
street
near
chelsea
hospital
a
place
much
inferior
to
those
in
which
rolfe
had
formerly
seen
him
his
two
rooms
were
at
the
top
and
he
had
converted
a
garret
into
a
dark
chamber
for
his
photographic
amusement
dirt
and
disorder
made
the
very
uninviting
rolfe
looked
about
him
and
wondered
what
principle
of
corruption
was
at
work
in
the
young
man
life
morphew
showed
a
new
portrait
of
his
betrothed
henrietta
winter
a
comely
face
shadowed
with
pensiveness
at
torquay
she
sent
it
a
day
or
two
i
been
thinking
of
giving
her
up
if
i
do
i
shall
do
it
brutally
and
savagely
to
make
it
easy
for
her
i
spoilt
her
life
and
i
pretty
sure
i
ruined
my
own
he
brought
out
a
bottle
of
whisky
and
half
filled
two
tumblers
his
own
measure
he
very
slightly
diluted
and
drank
it
off
at
once
at
a
bad
pass
my
boy
remarked
rolfe
wrong
something
more
than
usual
i
know
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
morphew
continued
to
declare
that
he
was
only
from
the
longstanding
causes
and
though
rolfe
did
not
believe
him
nothing
more
could
at
present
be
elicited
the
talk
turned
to
photography
but
still
had
no
life
in
it
think
you
had
better
dine
with
me
this
evening
said
harvey
i
wish
i
could
an
engagement
the
young
man
shuffled
about
and
after
a
struggle
with
embarrassment
aided
by
another
tumbler
of
whisky
threw
out
something
he
wished
to
say
deuced
hard
to
ask
you
but
could
you
lend
me
some
money
course
how
much
why
do
you
make
such
a
sputter
about
it
been
making
a
fool
of
myself
got
into
difficulties
will
you
let
me
have
fifty
pounds
if
you
promise
to
clear
at
once
out
of
this
and
in
a
month
or
so
come
into
wales
an
awfully
good
fellow
rolfe
and
i
a
damned
fool
i
promise
i
will
i
get
out
of
it
and
then
i
think
about
breaking
with
that
girl
better
for
both
of
us
but
you
shall
advise
tell
you
everything
some
day
i
ca
now
i
too
ashamed
of
myself
when
he
got
home
harvey
wrote
a
cheque
for
fifty
pounds
and
posted
it
at
once
not
many
days
after
there
came
to
him
a
letter
from
frothingham
with
this
lady
he
had
held
no
communication
since
the
catastrophe
of
last
november
knowing
not
how
to
address
her
without
giving
more
pain
than
his
sympathy
could
counterbalance
he
remained
silent
she
wrote
from
the
neighbourhood
of
swiss
cottage
where
she
had
taken
a
flat
it
was
her
wish
if
possible
to
see
him
a
matter
of
business
and
she
requested
that
he
would
make
an
appointment
much
wondering
in
what
business
of
frothingham
he
could
be
concerned
harvey
named
his
time
and
went
to
pay
the
call
he
ascended
many
stairs
and
was
conducted
by
a
neat
into
a
pleasant
little
where
frothingham
rose
to
receive
him
she
searched
his
face
as
if
to
discern
the
feeling
with
which
he
regarded
her
and
her
timid
smile
of
reassurance
did
not
lack
its
pathos
rolfe
it
seems
years
since
i
saw
you
she
was
aged
a
little
and
her
voice
fell
in
broken
notes
an
unhappy
contrast
to
the
gay
confident
chirping
of
less
than
twelve
months
ago
have
only
been
settled
here
for
a
week
i
thought
of
leaving
london
altogether
but
after
all
i
had
to
come
backwards
and
forwards
so
often
it
was
better
to
have
a
home
here
and
this
little
flat
will
just
suit
me
i
think
she
seemed
desirous
of
drawing
attention
to
its
modest
proportions
really
do
need
a
house
and
lodgings
are
so
wretched
these
flats
are
a
great
blessing
do
you
think
i
shall
manage
here
with
one
servant
only
one
rolfe
struggled
with
the
difficulty
of
not
knowing
what
to
say
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
discourse
as
innocently
as
might
be
on
the
advantages
of
flats
their
increasing
popularity
and
the
special
charms
of
this
particular
situation
frothingham
eagerly
agreed
with
everything
and
did
her
best
to
allow
no
moment
of
silence
have
heard
from
miss
frothingham
i
think
she
presently
let
fall
with
a
return
of
anxiety
very
long
ago
from
leipzig
i
do
know
whether
she
will
stay
there
you
know
she
is
thinking
of
taking
up
music
professionally
yes
i
do
so
hope
she
will
find
it
possible
but
of
course
that
kind
of
career
is
so
very
uncertain
i
not
sure
that
i
should
be
glad
if
she
turned
to
something
else
the
widow
was
growing
nervous
and
with
a
quick
movement
of
her
hands
she
suddenly
resumed
in
another
tone
rolfe
i
do
so
wish
you
would
let
me
speak
to
you
in
confidence
i
want
to
ask
your
help
in
a
most
delicate
matter
not
of
course
about
my
though
i
shall
have
to
mention
her
it
is
something
quite
personal
to
myself
if
i
could
hope
that
you
would
think
it
tiresome
i
have
a
special
reason
for
appealing
to
you
he
would
gladly
said
harvey
be
of
any
use
he
could
want
to
speak
to
you
about
painful
things
pursued
his
hostess
with
an
animation
and
emphasis
which
made
her
more
like
the
lady
of
fitzjohn
avenue
know
everything
except
my
own
position
and
that
is
what
i
wish
to
explain
to
you
i
wo
go
into
details
i
will
only
say
that
a
few
years
ago
my
husband
made
over
to
me
a
large
sum
of
money
i
had
none
of
my
own
and
that
it
still
belongs
to
me
i
say
belongs
to
me
but
there
is
my
trouble
i
fear
i
have
no
right
whatever
to
call
it
mine
and
there
are
people
who
have
suffered
such
dreadful
losses
some
of
them
you
know
there
was
a
family
named
abbott
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
them
poor
abbott
i
remember
reading
she
closed
her
eyes
for
an
instant
and
the
look
upon
her
face
told
that
this
was
no
affectation
of
an
anguished
memory
was
accident
rolfe
hastened
to
say
jury
found
it
accidental
death
there
was
the
loss
i
read
it
all
he
had
lost
everything
do
tell
me
what
became
of
his
family
someone
told
me
they
were
friends
of
yours
they
had
no
children
there
was
a
small
mrs
abbott
used
to
be
a
teacher
and
she
is
going
to
take
that
up
again
thing
is
she
quite
young
about
thirty
i
should
say
she
go
into
a
school
private
pupils
at
her
own
house
she
has
plenty
of
courage
and
will
do
fairly
well
i
think
it
is
shocking
that
she
should
have
lost
all
her
husband
too
just
at
that
dreadful
time
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
say
rolfe
do
you
think
it
would
be
possible
to
ask
her
to
accept
something
i
do
so
feel
she
hurried
on
i
ought
to
make
some
sort
of
restitution
what
i
can
to
those
who
lost
everything
i
am
told
that
things
are
not
quite
hopeless
something
may
be
recovered
out
of
the
wreck
some
day
but
it
will
be
such
a
long
time
and
meanwhile
people
are
suffering
so
and
here
am
i
left
in
comfort
more
than
comfort
it
is
right
i
could
rest
till
i
did
something
i
am
glad
to
say
that
i
have
been
able
to
help
a
little
here
and
there
but
only
the
kind
of
people
whom
it
easy
to
help
a
case
like
abbott
is
far
worse
yet
there
such
a
difficulty
in
doing
anything
one
might
only
give
offence
i
sure
my
name
must
be
hateful
to
her
as
it
is
to
so
many
rolfe
listened
with
a
secret
surprise
he
had
never
thought
ill
of
mrs
frothingham
but
on
the
other
hand
had
never
attributed
to
her
any
save
superficial
qualities
a
lightsome
temper
pleasure
in
hospitality
an
easy
good
nature
towards
all
the
people
of
her
acquaintance
he
would
not
have
supposed
her
capable
of
substantial
sacrifices
least
of
all
on
behalf
of
strangers
and
inspired
by
a
principle
she
spoke
with
the
simplest
sincerity
it
was
impossible
to
suspect
her
motives
the
careless
liking
with
which
he
had
always
regarded
her
was
now
infused
with
respect
he
became
gravely
attentive
and
answered
in
a
softer
voice
was
embittered
at
first
but
is
overcoming
it
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
think
she
will
benefit
by
this
trial
i
do
like
the
words
that
are
so
often
used
in
cant
i
do
believe
that
misery
does
any
good
to
most
people
indeed
i
know
very
well
that
it
generally
does
harm
but
abbott
seems
to
be
an
exception
she
has
a
good
deal
of
character
and
there
were
circumstances
well
i
will
only
say
that
she
faces
the
change
in
her
life
very
bravely
do
wish
i
knew
her
but
i
dare
ask
that
it
too
much
to
expect
that
she
could
bear
to
see
me
and
listen
to
what
i
have
to
say
less
she
reminded
of
the
past
the
better
i
think
would
it
not
be
possible
to
do
something
i
am
told
that
the
sum
was
about
fifteen
hundred
pounds
the
whole
of
that
i
could
restore
but
half
of
it
i
could
afford
so
much
could
i
offer
to
do
so
not
directly
in
my
own
name
but
through
you
harvey
reflected
his
head
and
body
bent
forward
his
hands
folded
together
in
the
flat
beneath
someone
was
jingling
operetta
on
a
piano
not
quite
in
tune
the
pertinacious
vivacity
of
the
airs
interfered
with
harvey
desire
to
view
things
seriously
he
had
begun
to
wonder
how
large
a
capital
frothingham
had
at
her
command
was
it
not
probable
that
she
could
as
easily
bestow
fifteen
hundred
pounds
as
the
half
of
that
sum
but
the
question
was
unworthy
if
in
truth
she
had
set
herself
to
undo
as
much
as
possible
of
the
wrong
perpetrated
by
her
husband
frothingham
might
well
limit
her
benefactions
be
her
fortune
what
it
might
will
do
whatever
you
desire
he
said
with
deliberation
can
not
answer
for
abbott
but
if
you
wish
it
she
shall
know
what
you
have
in
mind
do
wish
it
replied
the
lady
earnestly
beg
you
to
put
this
before
her
and
with
all
the
persuasion
you
can
use
i
should
be
very
very
glad
if
she
would
allow
me
to
free
my
conscience
from
a
little
of
this
burden
only
that
i
dare
not
speak
of
it
i
would
try
to
convince
you
that
i
am
doing
what
my
dear
husband
himself
would
have
wished
you
ca
believe
it
no
one
will
ever
believe
it
even
alma
i
am
afraid
and
that
is
so
cruel
so
dreadful
but
he
did
not
mean
to
wrong
people
in
this
way
it
was
in
his
nature
who
knew
him
better
than
i
or
so
well
i
know
if
he
could
come
back
to
us
her
voice
broke
the
piano
below
jingled
more
vivaciously
than
ever
and
a
sound
of
shrill
laughter
pierced
through
the
notes
afraid
to
sit
silent
lest
he
should
seem
unsympathetic
and
sceptical
rolfe
murmured
a
few
harmless
phrases
tending
to
nervous
incoherence
am
thinking
so
much
about
alma
pursued
the
widow
recovering
am
so
uncertain
about
my
duty
to
her
of
her
own
she
has
nothing
but
i
know
of
course
that
her
father
wished
her
to
share
in
what
he
gave
me
it
is
strange
rolfe
that
i
should
be
talking
to
you
as
if
you
were
a
relative
as
if
i
had
a
right
to
trouble
you
with
these
things
but
if
you
knew
how
few
people
i
dare
speak
to
was
it
so
much
better
for
her
to
lead
a
very
quiet
life
and
so
i
gave
her
only
a
little
money
only
enough
to
live
upon
in
the
simplest
way
i
hoped
she
would
get
tired
of
being
among
strangers
and
come
back
and
now
i
fear
she
thinks
i
have
behaved
meanly
and
selfishly
and
we
were
always
so
kindly
disposed
to
each
other
such
thorough
friends
never
a
word
that
might
have
passed
between
a
mother
and
her
own
child
gathered
from
her
letter
interposed
harvey
she
was
well
contented
and
working
hard
at
her
music
you
think
so
i
began
to
doubt
she
wrote
in
low
spirits
of
course
one
ca
say
whether
she
would
succeed
as
a
violinist
oh
i
do
like
to
think
of
it
i
must
tell
you
that
i
have
said
a
word
to
her
yet
of
what
i
am
doing
i
mean
about
the
money
i
know
i
ought
to
consider
as
much
as
other
people
poor
girl
who
has
suffered
more
and
in
so
many
ways
but
i
think
of
what
i
keep
for
myself
as
hers
i
was
not
brought
up
in
luxury
rolfe
it
would
seem
to
me
hard
to
live
on
a
very
little
but
in
this
too
i
must
consider
alma
i
dare
lose
all
my
acquaintances
i
must
keep
a
home
for
alma
and
a
home
she
would
feel
ashamed
of
here
you
see
she
could
have
her
friends
i
have
thought
of
going
to
leipzig
but
i
had
so
much
rather
she
came
to
london
if
only
for
us
just
to
talk
and
understand
each
other
harvey
preserved
the
gravest
demeanour
of
alma
he
would
not
permit
himself
to
speak
save
in
answer
to
a
direct
question
and
that
was
not
long
in
coming
am
sure
you
think
i
should
be
quite
open
with
her
would
seem
to
me
the
best
she
shall
know
all
my
thoughts
but
with
regard
to
abbott
i
know
so
well
what
she
would
say
i
beg
you
to
do
me
that
kindness
mr
rolfe
will
write
to
abbott
at
once
the
interview
was
at
an
end
neither
had
anything
more
to
say
they
parted
with
looks
of
much
mutual
kindliness
harvey
having
promised
to
make
another
call
when
abbott
reply
had
reached
him
after
exchanging
letters
with
abbott
harvey
went
over
to
see
her
for
the
sake
of
both
persons
concerned
he
resolved
to
leave
no
possibility
of
misunderstanding
a
few
days
passed
in
discussions
and
reflections
then
at
the
customary
hour
for
paying
calls
he
again
ascended
the
many
stairs
to
frothingham
flat
it
had
rained
all
day
and
in
this
weather
there
seemed
a
certainty
that
the
lady
would
be
at
home
but
as
he
approached
the
door
harvey
heard
a
sound
from
within
which
discomposed
him
who
save
one
person
was
likely
to
be
playing
on
the
violin
in
these
rooms
he
paused
cast
about
him
a
glance
of
indecision
and
finally
pressed
the
electric
bell
frothingham
was
not
at
home
she
might
return
very
shortly
miss
frothingham
at
home
the
servant
did
not
straightway
admit
him
but
took
his
name
on
his
entering
the
three
figures
appeared
before
him
he
saw
alma
he
recognised
miss
leach
the
third
lady
was
named
to
him
as
miss
leach
sister
knew
i
was
in
london
alma
remarked
rather
than
inquired
had
no
idea
of
it
until
i
heard
your
violin
violin
but
not
my
playing
it
was
miss
leach
from
the
first
word
her
how
do
as
he
entered
alma
tone
and
manner
appeared
to
him
forced
odd
unlike
anything
he
remembered
of
her
in
correcting
him
she
gave
a
hard
short
laugh
glancing
at
dora
leach
in
a
way
verging
upon
the
her
look
had
nothing
amiable
though
she
continuously
smiled
and
when
she
invited
the
visitor
to
be
seated
it
was
with
familiarity
very
unflattering
to
his
ear
came
to
see
mamma
of
course
i
dare
say
she
wo
be
long
she
had
to
go
through
the
rain
on
business
with
someone
or
other
perhaps
you
know
have
you
been
in
london
all
the
summer
oh
no
i
remember
you
told
me
you
had
been
somewhere
in
france
on
the
loire
was
it
rolfe
dropped
a
careless
affirmative
his
temper
prompted
him
to
ask
whether
miss
frothingham
knew
the
difference
between
the
loire
and
the
garonne
but
on
the
whole
he
was
more
puzzled
than
offended
what
had
come
over
this
young
woman
outwardly
she
was
not
much
altered
a
little
thinner
in
the
face
perhaps
her
eyes
seeming
a
trifle
darker
and
deeper
set
but
in
the
point
of
demeanour
she
had
appreciably
suffered
her
bearing
and
mode
of
speech
were
of
that
kind
which
in
a
man
would
be
called
was
it
a
result
of
if
her
stinted
allowance
had
already
produced
effects
such
as
this
mrs
frothingham
was
justified
in
uneasiness
he
turned
to
miss
leach
and
with
her
talked
exclusively
for
some
minutes
as
soon
as
civility
permitted
he
would
rise
and
make
his
escape
alma
the
while
chatted
with
the
younger
sister
whom
she
addressed
as
then
the
door
opened
and
frothingham
came
in
wearing
her
and
gave
him
cordial
welcome
though
in
few
and
nervous
costume
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
rolfe
with
a
peculiar
intensity
words
am
no
longer
alone
you
see
she
threw
a
swift
at
alma
is
a
great
pleasure
it
rain
still
mamma
asked
alma
in
a
high
voice
just
now
my
dear
but
it
very
disagreeable
i
walk
with
you
to
the
station
she
addressed
the
sisters
and
gerda
ca
stay
they
have
an
appointment
at
five
they
come
again
in
a
day
or
two
after
the
and
when
alma
with
a
remark
that
she
would
not
be
long
had
closed
the
door
behind
her
frothingham
seated
herself
and
began
to
draw
off
her
gloves
the
bonnet
and
cloak
she
was
wearing
though
handsome
and
in
the
mode
made
her
look
older
than
at
rolfe
last
visit
she
was
now
a
woman
with
emphasis
on
the
qualifying
term
in
home
dress
she
still
asserted
her
sex
grace
of
figure
and
freshness
of
complexion
prevailing
over
years
and
sorrows
at
this
moment
moreover
weariness
and
perhaps
worry
appeared
in
her
countenance
you
so
much
for
coming
she
said
quietly
must
have
been
surprised
when
you
saw
was
indeed
my
surprise
was
still
greater
when
without
any
warning
alma
walked
into
the
room
two
days
ago
but
i
was
so
glad
so
very
glad
she
breathed
a
little
sigh
looking
round
alma
given
her
friends
any
tea
i
must
ring
thank
oh
the
wretched
wretched
day
i
seem
to
notice
the
weather
so
much
more
than
i
used
to
does
it
affect
you
at
all
not
till
the
was
brought
in
and
she
had
sipped
from
her
cup
did
frothingham
lay
aside
these
commonplaces
with
abrupt
gravity
and
in
a
subdued
voice
she
at
length
inquired
the
result
of
delicate
mission
think
he
replied
i
made
known
your
wish
as
clearly
and
urgently
as
possible
i
have
seen
abbott
and
written
to
her
twice
it
will
be
best
perhaps
if
i
ask
you
to
read
her
final
letter
i
have
her
permission
to
show
it
to
you
he
drew
the
letter
from
its
envelope
and
with
a
nervous
hand
mrs
frothingham
took
it
for
perusal
whilst
she
was
thus
occupied
rolfe
averted
his
eyes
when
he
knew
that
she
had
read
to
the
end
he
looked
at
her
she
had
again
sighed
and
harvey
could
not
help
imagining
it
an
involuntary
signal
of
relief
am
very
glad
to
have
read
this
rolfe
if
you
had
merely
told
me
that
abbott
refused
i
should
have
felt
nothing
but
pain
as
it
is
i
understand
that
she
only
refuse
and
i
am
most
grateful
for
all
she
says
about
me
i
regret
more
than
ever
that
i
do
know
her
as
she
handed
the
letter
back
it
shook
like
a
blown
leaf
she
was
pale
and
spoke
with
effort
but
in
a
few
moments
when
conversation
was
resumed
her
tone
took
a
lightness
and
freedom
which
confirmed
rolfe
impression
that
she
had
escaped
from
a
great
embarrassment
and
this
surmise
he
inevitably
connected
with
alma
display
of
strange
not
another
word
passed
on
the
subject
with
frequent
glances
towards
the
door
frothingham

talked

harvey
eager
to
get
away
soon
rose
you
are
not
going
alma
will
be
back
in
a
moment
and
as
her
spoke
the
young
lady
reappeared
did
you
give
your
friends
tea

all
about

frothingham

that

almost
always
at
home
in
the
afternoon
that
it
would
always
give
her
so
much
pleasure

asked
harvey
barely

the

which
alma
cavalierly
offered
really

i
ought
to
just
to
look
after
mamma
frothingham
uttered
a
little
exclamation
and
tried
to
laugh
on
the
instant
harvey
withdrew
by
the
evening
post
on
the
following
day
he
was
surprised
to
receive
a
letter
addressed
in
alma
unmistakable
hand
the
contents
did
not
allay
his
wonder
dear
mr
rolfe
i
am
sure
you
will
not
mind
if
i
use
the
privilege
of
a
fairly
long
acquaintance
and
speak
plainly
about
something
that
i
regard
as
important
i
wish
to
say
that
i
am
quite
old
enough
and
feel
quite
competent
to
direct
the
course
of
my
own
life
it
is
very
kind
of
you
indeed
to
take
an
interest
in
what
i
do
and
what
i
hope
to
do
and
i
am
sure
mamma
will
be
fittingly
grateful
for
any
advice
you
may
have
offered
with
regard
to
me
but
i
feel
obliged
to
say
quite
distinctly
that
i
must
manage
my
own
affairs
pray
excuse
this
freedom
and
believe
me
yours
truly
he
gasped
and
with
wide
eyes
read
the
missive
again
and
again
as
soon
as
his
nerves
were
quieted
he
sat
down
and
replied
thus
dear
miss
frothingham
your
frankness
can
only
be
deemed
a
compliment
it
is
perhaps
a
triviality
on
my
part
but
i
feel
prompted
to
say
that
i
have
at
no
time
discussed
your
position
or
prospects
with
frothingham
and
that
i
have
neither
offered
advice
on
the
subject
nor
have
been
requested
to
do
so
if
this
statement
should
appear
to
you
at
all
germane
to
the
matter
i
beg
you
will
take
it
into
and
i
am
yours
truly
harvey
radcliffe
rolfe
chapter
this
reply
despatched
harvey
congratulated
himself
on
being
quits
with
miss
frothingham
her
letter
however
amusing
was
deliberate
impertinence
to
have
answered
it
in
a
serious
tone
would
have
been
to
encourage
conceit
which
merited
nothing
but
a
snub
but
what
had
excited
her
anger
had
frothingham
been
guilty
of
some
indiscretion
or
was
it
merely
the
result
of
hotheaded
surmises
and
suspicions
on
the
girl
part
plainly
alma
had
returned
to
england
in
no
amiable
mood
in
all
probability
she
resented
her
behaviour
now
that
it
had
been
explained
to
her
there
had
arisen
on
the
old
the
eternal
subject
money
ignoble
enough
but
was
it
a
new
thing
for
him
to
discern
ignoble
possibilities
in
alma
nature
nevertheless
his
thoughts
were
constantly
occupied
with
the
girl
her
image
haunted
him
all
his
manhood
was
subdued
and
mocked
by
her
scornful
witchery
from
the
infinitudes
of
reverie
her
eyes
drew
near
and
gazed
upon
him
eyes
gleaming
with
mischief
keen
with
curiosity
a
look
now
supercilious
now
softly
submissive
all
the
varieties
of
expression
caught
in
susceptible
moments
and
stored
by
a
too
faithful
memory
her
hair
her
lips
her
neck
grew
present
to
him
and
lured
his
fancy
with
a
wanton
seduction
in
pathetic
stratagem
of
intellectual
man
at
issue
with
the
flesh
he
fell
back
upon
the
idealism
which
ever
strives
to
endow
a
fair
woman
with
a
beautiful
soul
he
endeavoured
to
forget
her
body
in
contemplation
of
the
spiritual
excellencies
that
might
lurk
behind
it
to
depreciate
her
was
simpler
and
had
generally
been
his
wont
but
subjugation
had
reached
another
stage
in
him
he
summoned
all
possible
pleadings
on
the
behalf
her
talents
her
youth
her
grievous
trials
devotion
to
classical
music
can
not
but
argue
a
certain
loftiness
of
mind
it
might
in
truth
be
somehow
akin
to
remembering
his
own
follies
and
vices
at
the
age
of
was
it
not
reason
no
less
than
charity
to
see
in
alma
the
hope
of
future
good
nay
if
it
came
to
that
did
she
not
embody
infinitely
more
virtue
in
every
sense
of
the
word
than
he
at
the
same
age
one
must
be
just
to
women
and
however
paltry
the
causes
do
honour
to
the
cleanliness
of
their
life
nothing
had
suggested
to
him
that
alma
was
unworthy
of
everyday
respect
even
when
she
did
not
lose
her
sexual
dignity
and
after
all
she
had
undergone
there
would
have
been
excuse
enough
for
decline
of
character
to
say
nothing
of
a
lapse
from
the
articles
of
good
breeding
this
letter
of
hers
what
did
it
signify
but
the
revolt
of
a
spirit
of
independence
irritated
by
all
manner
of
sufferings
great
and
small
ought
he
not
to
have
replied
in
other
terms
was
it
worthy
of
him
man
of
the
world
with
passions
combats
experience
multiform
assimilated
in
his
long
slow
growth
to
set
his
sarcasm
against
a
girl
unhappiness
he
was
vexed
with
himself
he
had
not
behaved
as
a
gentleman
and
how
many
a
time
in
how
many
situations
had
he
incurred
this
form
of
when
a
week
went
by
without
anything
more
from
alma
harvey
ceased
to
trouble
as
the
fates
directed
so
be
it
he
began
to
pack
the
books
which
he
would
take
with
him
into
wales
one
day
he
found
himself
at
kensington
high
street
waiting
for
a
city
train
in
idleness
he
watched
the
people
who
alighted
from
carriages
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
platform
and
among
them
he
saw
alma
on
her
way
towards
the
stairs
she
was
obliged
to
pass
him
he
kept
his
position
and
only
looked
into
her
face
when
she
came
quite
near
she
bent
her
head
with
a
stopped
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
without
sign
of
embarrassment
was
quite
wrong
i
found
it
out
soon
after
i
had
written
and
i
have
wanted
to
beg
your
pardon
is
my
part
to
do
that
harvey
replied
ought
not
to
have
answered
as
i
did
not
all
things
considered
i
rather
in
a
hurry
as
a
second
thought
she
offered
her
hand
harvey
watched
her
trip
up
the
stairs
next
morning
he
had
a
letter
from
her
rolfe
she
wrote
you
let
mamma
know
of
my
hasty
and
foolish
behaviour
if
not
and
i
very
much
hope
you
did
please
not
to
reply
to
this
but
let
us
see
you
on
wednesday
afternoon
just
in
the
ordinary
way
if
mamma
been
told
still
do
trouble
to
write
and
in
that
case
i
dare
say
you
will
not
care
to
come
if
you
are
engaged
this
wednesday
perhaps
you
could
come
next
and
she
signed
herself
his
sincerely
he
did
not
reply
and
wednesday
saw
him
climbing
once
more
to
the
little
flat
ashamed
of
being
here
yet
unable
to
see
how
he
could
have
avoided
it
except
by
leaving
london
for
that
escape
he
had
no
longer
much
mind
quite
consciously
and
with
uneasiness
which
was
now
taking
a
new
form
he
had
yielded
to
alma
fascination
however
contemptible
and
unaccountable
this
was
the
state
of
things
with
him
and
as
he
waited
for
the
door
to
be
opened
it
made
him
feel
more
awkward
more
foolish
than
for
many
a
long
year
frothingham
and
her
were
sitting
alone
the
elder
lady
occupied
with
at
her
feet
a
basket
of
silks
and
the
younger
holding
a
book
nothing
could
have
been
quieter
or
more
no
sooner
had
he
entered
than
he
overcame
all
restraint
all
misgiving
there
was
nothing
here
today
but
peace
and
good
feeling
gentle
voices
and
quiet
amiability
whatever
shadow
had
arisen
between
the
two
ladies
must
have
passed
utterly
away
they
spoke
to
each
other
with
natural
kindness
and
each
had
a
tranquil
countenance
alma
began
at
once
to
talk
of
their
common
friends
the
carnabys
asking
whether
rolfe
knew
that
they
were
in
australia
knew
they
had
decided
to
go
he
answered
i
have
heard
for
at
least
two
months
then
i
can
give
you
all
the
news
i
had
a
letter
yesterday
when
carnaby
wrote
they
had
spent
a
fortnight
at
melbourne
and
were
going
on
to
brisbane
carnaby
is
going
to
do
something
in
queensland
something
about
mines
i
read
you
that
part
the
letter
lay
in
the
book
she
was
holding
sibyl
wrote
indefinitely
but
harvey
was
able
to
gather
that
the
mining
engineer
dando
had
persuaded
carnaby
to
take
an
active
interest
in
his
projects
discussion
on
speculative
enterprises
did
not
recommend
itself
to
the
present
company
and
rolfe
could
only
express
a
hope
that
his
friend
had
at
last
found
a
pursuit
in
which
he
could
interest
himself
fancy
sibyl
at
such
places
exclaimed
alma
with
amusement
curious
i
shall
be
to
see
her
when
she
comes
back
before
she
left
england
i
sure
she
had
the
least
idea
in
what
part
of
australia
brisbane
was
or
melbourne
either
i
did
know
myself
had
to
look
at
a
map
you
think
that
a
shameful
confession
mr
rolfe
own
ideas
of
australian
geography
are
vague
enough
but
have
you
been
there
to
any
of
the
new
countries
i
do
care
about
them
a
defect
i
admit
the
future
of
england
is
beyond
seas
i
would
have
children
taught
all
about
the
colonies
before
bothering
them
with
histories
of
greece
and
rome
i
wish
i
had
gone
out
there
myself
as
a
boy
and
grown
up
a
alma
laughed
one
of
the
things
you
say
just
to
puzzle
people
it
contradicts
all
sorts
of
things
i
heard
you
say
at
other
do
think
mamma
that
rolfe
missed
his
vocation
when
he
did
become
a
frothingham
gently
shook
her
head
no
trace
of
nervousness
appeared
in
her
today
manipulating
the
coloured
silks
she
only
now
and
then
put
in
a
quiet
word
but
followed
the
talk
with
interest
i
quite
thought
you
had
been
to
australia
alma
resumed
see
it
very
theoretical
your
admiration
of
the
new
countries
and
i
believe
you
would
rather
die
at
once
in
england
than
go
to
live
in
any
such
part
of
the
world
of
mind
that
all
you
admit
it
that
something
gained
you
always
smile
at
other
people
confessions
and
keep
your
own
mind
mysterious
i
always
thought
one
of
my
faults
was
only
shows
how
little
we
know
ourselves
harvey
was
reflecting
on
the
incompleteness
of
his
knowledge
of
alma
intentionally
or
not
she
appeared
to
him
at
this
moment
in
a
perfectly
new
light
he
could
not
have
pictured
her
so
simple
of
manner
so
direct
so
placid
trouble
seemed
to
have
given
her
a
holiday
and
at
the
same
time
to
have
released
her
from
you
have
never
told
us
she
went
on
your
wanderings
in
france
this
summer
english
people
do
go
much
to
that
part
do
they
i
happened
to
read
a
book
about
it
it
the
old
of
french
and
english
interesting
to
any
one
pedantic
enough
to
care
for
such
things
not
to
people
born
to
be
and
you
had
a
serious
did
rolfe
tell
you
mamma
dear
that
he
nearly
died
at
some
miserable
roadside
inn
frothingham
looked
startled
and
declared
she
knew
nothing
of
it
harvey
obliged
to
narrate
did
so
in
the
fewest
possible
words
and
dismissed
the
matter
suppose
you
have
had
many
such
experiences
said
alma
when
do
you
start
on
your
next
travels
have
nothing
in
view
i
half
thought
of
going
for
the
winter
to
a
place
in
north
wales
carnarvonshire
on
the
outer
sea
the
ladies
begged
for
more
information
and
he
related
how
on
a
ramble
with
a
friend
last
spring
it
was
basil
morton
he
had
come
upon
this
still
little
town
between
the
mountains
and
the
shore
amid
a
country
shining
with
yellow
gorse
hills
clothed
with
larch
heathery
moorland
ferny
lanes
and
wild
heights
where
the
wind
roars
on
crag
or
cairn
railway
within
seven
miles
just
the
place
for
a
pedant
to
escape
to
and
live
there
through
the
winter
with
his
musty
books
it
must
be
equally
delightful
for
people
who
are
not
pedants
exclaimed
alma
spring
or
summer
no
doubt
though
even
then
the
civilised
person
would
probably
find
it
dull
your
favourite
affectation
again
i
sure
it
nothing
but
affectation
when
you
speak
scornfully
of
civilised
people
i
hope
i
never
do
mamma
said
alma
with
a
laugh
rolfe
is
in
his
very
mildest
humour
today
we
must
expect
any
reproofs
for
our
good
he
will
tell
us
presently
that
we
are
patterns
of
all
the
virtues
frothingham
spoke
in
a
graver
strain
i
sure
it
is
possible
to
be
too
civilised
to
want
too
many
comforts
and
become
a
slave
to
them
since
i
have
been
living
here
mr
rolfe
you
ca
think
how
i
have
got
to
enjoy
the
simplicity
of
this
kind
of
life
everything
is
so
easy
things
go
so
smoothly
just
one
servant
who
ca
make
mistakes
because
there
next
to
nothing
to
do
no
wonder
people
are
taking
to
flats
is
that
what
you
mean
by
alma
asked
of
rolfe
did
say
anything
about
it
but
i
should
think
many
people
in
large
and
troublesome
houses
would
agree
with
frothingham
easy
to
imagine
a
time
when
such
burdens
wo
be
tolerated
our
misfortune
is
of
course
that
we
are
not
civilised
enough
enough
to
give
up
fashionable
nonsense
i
agree
with
that
wretched
slaves
most
of
us
it
was
the
first
sentence
alma
had
spoken
in
a
tone
that
rolfe
recognised
for
a
moment
her
face
lost
its
placid
smile
and
harvey
hoped
that
she
would
say
more
to
the
same
purpose
but
she
was
silent
sure
remarked
frothingham
with
feeling
most
happiness
is
found
in
simple
homes
we
be
simple
by
wishing
it
asked
alma
you
think
we
have
to
be
born
to
simplicity
not
sure
that
i
know
what
you
mean
by
the
word
said
harvey
not
sure
that
i
know
myself
mamma
meant
poverty
i
think
but
there
may
be
a
simple
life
without
poverty
i
should
say
i
thinking
of
disregard
for
other
people
foolish
opinions
living
just
as
you
feel
most
at
ease
not
torturing
yourself
because
it
the
custom
just
what
requires
courage
rolfe
remarked
i
suppose
it
does
one
knows
people
who
live
in
misery
just
because
they
dare
be
comfortable
keeping
up
houses
and
things
they
ca
afford
when
if
they
only
considered
themselves
their
income
would
be
quite
enough
for
everything
they
really
want
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
that
too
foolish
for
belief
harvey
felt
that
the
topic
was
growing
dangerous
he
said
nothing
but
wished
to
have
more
of
alma
views
in
this
direction
they
seemed
to
strike
her
freshly
perhaps
she
had
never
thought
of
the
matter
in
this
way
before
what
i
meant
she
continued
i
said
you
must
be
born
to
simplicity
i
should
think
no
one
ever
gave
up
fashionable
extravagance
just
because
they
saw
it
to
be
foolish
people
have
the
strength
of
mind
i
dare
say
she
added
with
a
bright
look
who
strong
enough
to
do
that
kind
of
thing
would
be
admired
and
envied
whom
rolfe
asked
by
their
acquaintances
who
were
still
slaves
do
know
admiration
and
envy
are
not
commonly
excited
by
merely
reasonable
behaviour
this
would
be
something
more
than
merely
reasonable
it
would
be
the
beginning
of
a
revolution
dear
remarked
frothingham
smiling
sadly
would
never
believe
that
it
did
mean
loss
of
money
might
be
made
to
believe
it
it
would
depend
entirely
on
the
persons
of
course
alma
seemed
to
weary
of
the
speculation
and
to
throw
it
aside
harvey
noticed
a
shadow
on
her
face
again
which
this
time
did
not
pass
quickly
he
was
so
comfortable
in
his
chair
the
ladies
seemed
so
entirely
at
leisure
such
a
noiseless
calm
brooded
about
them
unbroken
by
any
new
arrival
that
two
hours
went
by
insensibly
and
with
lingering
reluctance
the
visitor
found
it
time
to
take
his
leave
on
reviewing
the
afternoon
harvey
concluded
that
it
was
probably
as
void
of
meaning
as
of
event
alma
on
friendly
terms
once
more
with
her
felt
for
the
moment
amiably
disposed
towards
everyone
himself
included
this
idle
good
humour
and
insignificant
talk
was
meant
no
doubt
for
an
apology
all
he
had
to
expect
it
implied
of
course
thorough
indifference
towards
him
as
an
individual
as
a
member
of
their
shrunken
circle
he
was
worth
retaining
having
convinced
herself
of
his
innocence
of
undue
pretensions
alma
would
as
the
children
say
be
friends
again
and
everything
should
go
smoothly
he
lived
through
a
week
of
the
wretchedest
indecision
and
at
the
end
of
it
when
wednesday
afternoon
came
round
was
again
climbing
the
many
stairs
to
the
frothinghams
flat
even
more
nervous
than
last
time
much
more
ashamed
of
himself
and
utterly
doubtful
as
to
his
reception
the
maid
admitted
him
without
remark
and
showed
him
into
an
empty
room
when
he
had
waited
for
five
minutes
staring
at
objects
he
did
not
see
alma
entered
went
out
to
lunch
she
said
languidly
shaking
hands
with
him
has
come
back
yet
no
greeting
could
have
conveyed
less
encouragement
she
seated
herself
with
a
lifeless
movement
looked
at
him
and
smiled
as
if
discharging
a
duty
thought
he
blundered
into
speech
wednesday
was
probably
your
regular
afternoon
is
nothing
regular
yet
we
have
arranged
our
life
we
are
glad
to
see
our
friends
whenever
they
pray
sit
down
he
did
so
resolving
to
stay
for
a
few
minutes
only
in
the
silence
that
followed
their
eyes
met
and
as
though
it
were
too
much
trouble
to
avert
her
look
alma
continued
to
regard
him
she
smiled
again
and
with
more
meaning
you
have
quite
forgiven
me
fell
from
her
lips
just
when
harvey
was
about
to
speak
i
told
you
at
the
station
i
feel
that
there
is
more
fault
on
my
side
you
wrote
under
such
a
strange
misconception
and
i
ought
to
have
patiently
explained
myself
no
you
were
quite
right
in
treating
me
sharply
i
do
quite
remember
what
i
said
but
i
know
it
must
have
been
outrageous
after
that
i
did
what
i
ought
to
have
done
before
just
had
a
talk
with
mamma
you
took
it
for
granted
without
any
evidence
that
i
came
here
as
a
meddler
or
busybody
his
voice
was
perfectly
and
alma
answered
in
the
same
tone
there
was
evidence
mamma
had
been
talking
about
her
affairs
and
mentioned
that
she
had
consulted
you
about
something
oh
about
mrs
abbott
logical
i
must
say
remarked
rolfe
laughing
do
think
logic
is
my
strong
point
she
sat
far
back
in
the
easy
chair
her
head
supported
her
hands
resting
upon
the
chair
arms
the
languor
which
she
hardly
made
an
effort
to
overcome
began
to
invade
her
companion
like
an
influence
from
the
air
he
gazed
at
her
perceiving
a
new
beauty
in
the
face
a
new
seductiveness
in
the
slim
abandoned
body
a
dress
of
grey
silk
trimmed
with
black
refined
the
ivory
whiteness
of
her
flesh
its
faint
rustling
when
she
moved
affected
harvey
with
a
delicious
thrill
no
reason
now
she
continued
we
should
talk
about
it
i
mean
the
things
you
discussed
with
mamma
you
imagine
i
dare
say
that
i
selfishly
objected
to
what
she
was
doing
nothing
of
the
kind
i
did
quite
see
why
she
had
kept
it
from
me
that
was
all
it
was
as
if
she
felt
afraid
of
my
greediness
but
i
not
greedy
i
think
i
more
selfish
than
ordinary
people
and
i
think
mamma
is
doing
exactly
what
she
ought
i
very
glad
she
felt
about
things
in
that
way
harvey
nodded
and
spoke
in
a
subdued
voice
was
only
consulted
about
one
person
whom
i
happened
to
know
mrs
abbott
her
eyes
were
again
fixed
upon
him
and
he
read
their
curiosity
just
as
he
was
about
to
speak
the
servant
appeared
with
tea
alma
slowly
raised
herself
and
whilst
she
plied
the
office
of
hostess
harvey
got
rid
of
the
foolish
hat
and
stick
that
encumbered
him
he
had
now
no
intention
of
hurrying
away
as
if
by
natural
necessity
they
talked
of
nothing
in
particular
whilst
tea
was
sipped
harvey
still
held
his
cup
when
at
the
outer
door
sounded
a
causing
him
silently
to
execrate
the
intruder
whoever
it
might
be
unheeding
and
as
if
she
had
not
heard
alma
chatted
of
trifles
harvey
ear
detected
movements
without
but
no
one
entered
in
a
minute
or
two
he
again
breathed
freely
abbott
alma
just
dropped
the
name
as
if
beginning
a
remark
but
lapsed
into
silence
i
tell
you
all
about
her
said
rolfe
husband
death
left
her
in
great
difficulties
she
had
hardly
anything
a
friend
of
hers
a
langland
who
lives
at
gunnersbury
was
very
kind
and
helpful
they
talked
things
over
and
abbott
decided
to
take
a
house
at
gunnersbury
and
teach
children
she
was
a
teacher
before
her
marriage
children
of
her
own
one
died
but
unfortunately
she
has
the
care
of
two
whose
mother
a
cousin
of
hers
is
dead
and
whose
father
has
run
away
away
left
the
children
behind
in
a
garret
to
starve
or
go
to
the
workhouse
or
anything
else
a
spirited
man
independent
you
see
no
foolish
prejudices
abbott
has
to
support
them
one
else
could
take
them
they
live
with
her
did
mention
that
to
mamma
i
thought
it
needless
the
silence
that
followed
was
embarrassing
to
harvey
he
broke
it
by
abruptly
changing
the
subject
you
practised
long
today
was
the
absent
reply
thought
you
looked
rather
tired
as
if
you
had
been
working
too
hard
i
do
work
too
hard
said
alma
impatiently
me
i
remember
that
it
is
a
forbidden
subject
at
all
you
may
ask
anything
you
like
about
myself
i
not
working
particularly
hard
just
now
thinking
a
good
deal
though
suppose
you
let
me
have
your
thoughts
on
the
same
subject
no
harm
but
i
dare
say
i
know
them
without
your
telling
me
hardly
think
you
do
said
rolfe
regarding
her
steadily
all
events
his
voice
faltered
a
little
afraid
you
do
oh
she
laughed
be
afraid
i
have
plenty
of
courage
and
quite
enough
obstinacy
it
rather
does
me
good
when
people
show
they
have
no
faith
in
me
did
understand
murmured
harvey
make
me
understand
she
exclaimed
nervously
moving
in
the
chair
as
if
about
to
stand
up
but
remaining
seated
and
bent
forward
her
eyes
fixed
upon
him
in
a
sort
of
challenge
believe
i
know
what
you
mean
all
the
time
you
did
discuss
me
with
mamma
as
i
suspected
but
you
think
about
me
just
as
she
no
let
me
go
on
then
you
shall
confess
i
was
right
you
have
no
faith
in
my
powers
to
begin
with
it
seems
to
you
very
unlikely
that
an
everyday
sort
of
girl
whom
you
have
met
in
society
and
know
all
about
should
develop
into
a
great
artist
no
faith
that
the
first
thing
then
you
are
so
kind
as
to
have
fears
for
me
yes
it
was
your
own
word
you
think
that
you
know
the
world
whilst
i
am
ignorant
of
it
and
that
it
a
sort
of
duty
to
offer
warnings
harvey
all
but
angry
expression
as
he
listened
and
fidgeted
suddenly
stopped
her
can
you
deny
that
these
things
are
in
your
mind
are
not
in
my
mind
at
this
moment
that
quite
certain
said
harvey
bluntly
what
is
it
is
easy
to
say
when
you
insist
on
quarrelling
with
me
why
do
you
use
this
tone
do
i
strike
you
as
a
pedagogue
a
preacher
something
of
that
sort
his
energy
in
part
subdued
her
she
smiled
uneasily
i
do
see
you
in
that
light
much
the
better
i
wanted
to
appear
to
you
simply
a
man
and
one
who
has
perhaps
the
misfortune
to
see
in
only
a
very
beautiful
and
a
very
desirable
woman
alma
sat
motionless
her
smile
had
passed
vanishing
in
a
swift
gleam
of
pleasure
which
left
her
countenance
bright
though
grave
in
the
same
moment
there
sounded
again
a
at
the
outer
door
through
his
whirling
senses
harvey
was
aware
of
the
threatened
interruption
and
all
but
cursed
aloud
that
alma
had
the
same
expectation
appeared
in
her
moving
so
as
to
assume
a
more
ordinary
attitude
but
she
uttered
the
word
that
had
risen
to
her
lips
misfortune
you
call
it
harvey
followed
her
example
in
disposing
his
limbs
more
conventionally
also
in
the
tuning
of
his
voice
to
something
between
jest
and
earnest
said
the
misfortune
makes
a
difference
certainly
she
smiled
her
eyes
turned
to
the
door
is
a
great
word
one
of
the
most
useful
in
the
do
you
think
so
mamma
frothingham
had
just
entered
chapter
the
inconceivable
had
come
to
pass
by
a
word
and
a
look
harvey
had
made
real
what
he
was
always
telling
himself
could
never
be
more
than
a
dream
and
a
dream
of
unutterable
folly
frothingham
unconscious
intervention
availed
him
nothing
he
had
spoken
and
must
speak
again
for
a
man
of
sensitive
honour
there
could
be
no
trilling
in
such
a
matter
as
this
with
a
girl
in
alma
frothingham
position
and
did
he
not
rejoice
that
wavering
was
no
longer
possible
this
was
love
but
of
what
quality
he
no
longer
cared
or
dared
to
analyse
it
too
late
for
all
that
he
had
told
alma
that
he
loved
her
and
did
not
repent
it
nay
hoped
passionately
to
hear
from
her
lips
the
echoed
syllable
it
was
merely
the
proof
of
madness
a
shake
of
the
head
might
cure
him
but
from
that
way
to
sanity
all
his
blood
shrank
he
must
consider
he
must
be
practical
if
he
meant
to
ask
alma
to
marry
him
and
of
course
he
did
an
indispensable
preliminary
was
to
make
known
the
crude
facts
of
his
worldly
position
well
he
could
say
with
entire
honesty
that
he
had
over
nine
hundred
pounds
a
year
this
was
omitting
a
disbursement
of
an
annual
fifty
pounds
of
which
he
need
not
speak
the
sum
he
had
insisted
on
paying
abbott
that
she
might
be
able
to
maintain
wager
children
with
all
the
difficulty
in
the
world
had
he
gained
his
point
abbott
did
not
wish
the
children
to
go
into
other
hands
she
made
it
a
matter
of
conscience
to
keep
them
by
her
and
to
educate
them
yet
this
seemed
barely
possible
with
the
combat
for
a
livelihood
before
her
abbott
yielded
and
their
clasp
of
hands
cemented
a
wholesome
friendship
frank
unsuspicious
rarest
of
relations
between
man
and
woman
but
all
this
there
was
certainly
no
need
of
disclosing
at
midnight
he
was
penning
a
letter
it
must
not
be
long
it
must
not
strike
the
lyrical
note
yet
assuredly
it
must
not
read
like
a
commercial
overture
he
had
great
difficulty
in
writing
anything
that
seemed
tolerable
yet
done
it
must
be
and
done
it
was
and
before
going
to
bed
he
had
dropped
his
letter
into
the
post
he
durst
not
leave
it
for
reperusal
in
the
morning
light
then
came
torture
of
expectancy
the
whole
man
aching
sore
with
impatience
reason
utterly
fled
intellect
bemused
and
baffled
a
healthy
competent
citizen
of
nigh
middle
age
set
all
at
once
in
the
corner
crowned
with
a
fool
cap
twiddling
his
thumbs
in
nervous
fury
dolorous
spectacle
and
laughable
withal
he
waited
hours
then
clutched
at
alma
reply
rolfe
will
you
come
again
next
wednesday
that
was
all
did
it
amuse
her
to
keep
him
in
suspense
the
invitation
might
imply
a
fulfilment
of
his
hopes
but
alma
capriciousness
allowed
no
certainty
a
week
reflection
was
as
likely
to
have
one
result
as
another
for
him
it
meant
a
week
of
solitude
and
vacancy
or
would
have
meant
it
but
for
that
element
in
his
character
that
saving
strain
of
practical
rationality
which
had
brought
him
thus
far
in
life
without
sheer
overthrow
an
hour
after
receiving
alma
enigmatical
note
he
was
oppressed
by
inertia
another
hour
roused
him
to
and
supplied
him
with
a
project
that
night
he
took
the
steamer
from
harwich
to
antwerp
and
for
the
next
four
days
wandered
through
the
netherlands
reviving
his
memories
of
a
journey
under
very
different
circumstances
fifteen
years
ago
the
weather
was
bright
and
warm
on
the
whole
he
enjoyed
himself
he
reached
london
again
early
on
wednesday
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
with
a
touch
of
weather
on
his
cheek
presented
himself
at
alma
door
she
awaited
him
in
the
alone
this
time
he
felt
sure
no
interruption
was
to
be
feared
he
entered
with
confident
step
and
a
cheery
salutation
a
glance
showed
him
that
his
had
served
him
well
it
was
alma
who
looked
pale
and
who
betrayed
timidity
and
could
not
at
once
command
herself
have
you
been
doing
she
asked
remarking
his
appearance
about
a
little
he
replied
you
look
as
if
you
had
been
a
voyage
i
have
a
short
one
and
he
told
her
how
his
week
had
passed
that
how
you
would
like
to
spend
your
life
always
travelling
no
i
did
it
to
kill
time
you
must
remember
that
a
week
is
something
like
a
year
to
a
man
who
is
waiting
impatiently
she
dropped
her
eyes
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
but
i
never
thought
you
very
impatient
you
always
seemed
to
take
things
philosophically
generally
try
to
there
was
a
pause
alma
leaning
forward
in
her
chair
kept
her
eyes
down
and
did
not
raise
them
when
she
again
spoke
have
surprised
and
perplexed
and
worried
me
i
thought
in
a
time
i
should
know
what
to
say
but
does
it
strike
you
rolfe
that
we
in
a
strange
position
towards
each
other
you
know
very
little
of
me
very
little
indeed
i
sure
and
of
you
when
i
come
to
think
of
it
all
i
really
know
is
that
you
hardly
care
at
all
for
what
has
always
been
my
one
great
interest
is
putting
it
in
a
way
or
you
think
so
i
see
things
rather
differently
in
one
sense
i
care
very
much
indeed
for
everything
that
really
makes
a
part
of
your
life
and
simply
because
i
care
very
much
about
you
yourself
i
do
know
you
who
knows
any
other
human
being
but
i
have
formed
an
idea
of
you
and
an
idea
that
has
great
power
over
my
thoughts
wishes
purposes
everything
it
has
made
me
say
what
i
thought
i
should
never
say
to
any
woman
and
makes
me
feel
glad
that
i
have
said
it
and
full
of
hope
alma
drew
in
her
breath
and
smiled
faintly
still
she
did
not
look
at
him
of
course
i
have
formed
an
idea
of
you
you
sketch
the
outline
and
let
me
correct
it
think
i
am
pretty
sure
to
be
wrong
she
asked
raising
her
eyes
and
regarding
him
for
a
moment
with
anxiety
should
have
said
complete
it
i
hope
i
have
never
shown
myself
to
you
in
an
altogether
false
light
is
the
one
thing
i
have
felt
sure
about
said
alma
slowly
and
thoughtfully
have
always
seemed
the
same
you
do
change
with
circumstances
as
people
generally
do
harvey
had
a
word
on
his
lips
but
checked
it
and
merely
gazed
at
her
till
her
eyes
again
encountered
his
then
alma
smiled
more
naturally
was
something
you
did
speak
of
in
your
letter
what
kind
of
life
do
you
look
forward
to
not
sure
that
i
understand
my
practical
aims
you
mean
she
faltered
with
embarrassment
i
afraid
i
have
none
i
mentioned
the
facts
of
my
position
and
i
said
that
i
could
hope
for
its
improvement
no
no
you
misunderstand
me
i
am
not
thinking
about
money
i
hate
the
word
and
wish
i
might
never
hear
it
again
she
spoke
with
impetuosity
meant
how
and
where
do
you
wish
to
live
what
thoughts
had
you
about
the
future
very
definite
i
confess
and
chiefly
because
if
what
i
desired
came
to
pass
i
thought
of
everything
as
depending
upon
you
i
have
no
place
in
the
world
i
have
no
relatives
nearer
than
cousins
of
late
years
i
have
been
growing
rather
bookish
and
rather
fond
of
quietness
but
of
course
that
resulted
from
circumstances
when
a
man
offers
marriage
of
course
he
usually
says
my
life
is
this
and
this
will
you
enter
into
it
and
share
it
with
me
i
do
wish
to
say
anything
of
the
kind
my
life
may
take
all
sorts
of
forms
when
i
ask
you
to
share
it
i
ask
you
to
share
liberty
not
restraint
gipsy
life
she
asked
half
playfully
your
inclination
to
that
alma
shook
her
head
i
am
tired
of
and
she
added
as
if
on
an
impulse
am
tired
of
london
we
agree
i
too
am
tired
of
both
her
manner
altered
she
straightened
herself
and
spoke
with
more
about
my
art
my
career
is
for
me
to
ask
that
question
replied
harvey
gazing
steadfastly
at
her
do
mean
that
it
would
all
necessarily
come
to
an
end
i
mean
what
i
say
when
i
speak
of
sharing
liberty
heaven
forbid
that
i
should
put
an
end
to
any
aim
or
hope
of
yours
to
anything
that
is
part
of
yourself
i
want
you
to
be
yourself
many
people
nowadays
revolt
against
marriage
because
it
generally
means
bondage
and
they
have
much
to
say
for
themselves
if
i
had
been
condemned
to
a
wearisome
occupation
and
a
very
small
income
i
sure
i
should
never
have
asked
anyone
to
marry
me
i
do
think
it
fair
it
may
seem
to
you
that
i
have
much
right
to
call
myself
an
independent
man
as
it
is
alma
broke
in
impatiently
speak
of
money
you
have
enough
more
than
enough
it
seems
to
me
you
are
afraid
this
might
prevent
you
from
becoming
a
professional
musician
know
it
would
she
answered
with
quiet
decision
should
never
dream
of
putting
obstacles
in
your
way
do
understand
and
believe
me
i
do
want
to
shape
you
to
any
model
of
my
own
i
want
you
to
be
your
true
self
and
live
the
life
you
are
meant
for
the
same
you
would
rather
i
did
not
become
a
professional
musician
now
be
honest
with
me
be
honest
before
everything
you
need
answer
i
know
it
well
enough
and
if
i
marry
you
i
give
up
my
music
rolfe
scrutinised
her
face
observed
the
tremulous
mouth
the
nervous
eyelid
he
said
will
be
better
for
you
not
to
marry
me
and
silence
fell
upon
the
room
a
silence
in
which
harvey
could
hear
a
breath
and
the
rustle
of
silk
he
was
surprised
by
a
voice
in
quite
a
new
tone
softly
melodious
give
me
up
very
easily
more
easily
than
you
give
up
your
music
a
difference
do
you
remember
what
we
were
saying
last
wednesday
about
simplicity
of
living
wednesday
it
seems
a
month
ago
yes
i
remember
have
thought
a
good
deal
of
that
i
feel
how
vulgar
the
life
is
that
most
people
lead
they
ca
help
it
they
think
it
impossible
to
do
anything
else
but
i
should
like
to
break
away
from
it
altogether
to
live
as
i
chose
and
not
care
a
bit
what
other
people
said
harvey
had
the
same
difficulty
as
before
in
attaching
much
significance
to
these
phrases
they
were
pleasant
to
hear
for
they
chimed
with
his
own
thoughts
but
he
could
not
respond
with
great
seriousness
wife
of
a
man
with
my
income
wo
have
much
choice
i
fancy
can
you
say
that
exclaimed
alma
know
that
most
people
would
take
a
house
in
a
good
part
of
london
and
live
up
to
the
last
penny
making
everyone
think
that
their
income
must
be
two
or
three
thousand
pounds
i
know
all
about
that
kind
of
thing
and
it
sickens
me
there
the
choice
between
vulgar
display
with
worry
and
a
simple
refined
life
with
perfect
comfort
you
fancied
i
should
want
a
house
in
london
hardy
thought
anything
about
it
it
would
ease
your
mind
if
i
said
that
i
would
far
rather
live
in
a
cottage
as
quietly
and
simply
as
possible
does
ease
my
mind
or
rather
what
makes
me
very
happy
is
that
you
do
refuse
to
think
of
giving
me
your
companionship
alma
flushed
a
little
have
promised
after
all
my
thinking
about
it
it
came
to
this
that
i
could
make
up
my
mind
till
i
had
talked
over
everything
with
you
if
i
marry
i
must
know
what
my
life
is
going
to
be
and
it
puzzles
me
that
you
could
dream
of
making
anyone
your
wife
before
you
had
asked
her
all
sorts
of
questions
in
his
great
contentment
harvey
laughed
theoretically
but
how
is
a
man
to
begin
asking
questions
how
many
would
he
ask
before
he
got
sent
about
his
business
the
very
way
of
putting
his
chance
to
the
test
said
alma
brightly
he
sent
about
his
business
how
much
better
for
him
than
to
marry
on
a
misunderstanding
agree
with
you
perfectly
i
never
heard
anyone
talk
better
sense
on
the
subject
alma
looked
pleased
as
she
always
did
when
receiving
a
compliment
you
believe
then
rolfe
that
i
am
quite
in
earnest
in
hating
show
and
pretences
and
extravagance
and
wishing
to
live
in
just
the
opposite
way
will
believe
it
if
you
cease
to
address
me
by
that
formal
name
a
show
and
a
pretence
and
just
a
little
extravagant
her
cheeks
grew
warm
again
reminds
me
she
said
did
know
you
had
a
second
name
till
i
got
that
letter
had
almost
forgotten
it
myself
till
i
answered
a
certain
other
letter
i
did
know
till
then
that
had
a
second
name
your
florence
called
out
my
radcliffe
which
sounds
fiery
does
it
i
always
felt
that
the
name
me
i
got
it
from
my
mother
your
first
harvey
first
i
got
from
a
fine
old
doctor
about
whom
i
tell
you
some
day
alma
named
your
name
i
did
address
you
by
it
you
will
us
talk
could
you
live
far
away
from
london
in
some
place
that
people
know
nothing
about
you
indeed
i
could
and
be
glad
enough
if
i
never
saw
london
again
an
exaltation
possessed
alma
her
eyes
grew
very
bright
gazing
as
if
at
a
mental
picture
and
her
hands
trembled
as
she
continued
to
speak
do
mean
that
we
are
to
go
and
be
hermits
in
a
wilderness
our
friends
must
visit
us
our
real
friends
no
one
else
just
the
people
we
really
care
about
and
those
wo
be
many
if
i
give
up
a
public
career
as
of
course
i
shall
there
no
need
to
give
up
music
i
can
go
on
with
it
in
a
better
spirit
for
pure
love
of
it
without
any
wish
for
making
money
and
reputation
you
do
think
this
a
mere
dream
harvey
thought
more
than
he
was
disposed
to
say
he
marvelled
at
her
sudden
enthusiasm
for
an
ideal
he
had
not
imagined
her
capable
of
pursuing
if
he
only
now
saw
into
the
girl
true
character
revealed
by
the
awakening
of
her
emotions
how
nobly
was
his
ardour
justified
all
but
despising
himself
for
loving
her
he
had
instinctively
chosen
the
one
woman
whose
heart
and
mind
could
inspire
him
to
a
life
above
his
own
should
think
it
a
dream
he
answered
i
did
hear
it
from
your
lips
it
is
so
easy
we
keep
all
the
best
things
and
throw
off
only
the
worthless
the
things
that
waste
time
and
hurt
the
mind
no
crowded
rooms
no
wearying
artificial
talk
no
worry
with
a
swarm
of
servants
no
dressing
and
fussing
the
whole
day
to
one
self
for
work
and
pleasure
a
small
house
just
large
enough
for
order
and
quietness
and
to
keep
a
room
for
the
friend
who
comes
how
many
people
would
like
such
a
life
but
have
the
courage
to
live
it
shall
it
be
alma
have
given
no
promise
i
only
say
this
is
the
life
that
ij
should
like
perhaps
you
would
soon
weary
of
it
not
easily
i
think
might
be
travel
too
she
went
on
fervently
should
be
rich
when
other
people
living
in
the
ordinary
vulgar
way
would
have
nothing
to
spare
no
tours
where
the
crowd
goes
real
travel
in
parts
are
describing
just
what
i
should
choose
for
myself
but
i
should
have
dared
to
ask
it
of
you
why
i
told
you
that
you
knew
so
little
of
me
we
are
only
just
beginning
to
understand
each
other
place
have
you
in
mind
that
would
have
to
be
thought
about
did
you
say
you
were
going
to
some
beautiful
spot
in
wales
harvey
reflected
wonder
whether
you
would
like
that
are
only
supposing
you
know
but
show
me
where
it
is
if
you
wait
a
moment
i
fetch
a
map
she
rose
quickly
he
had
just
time
to
reach
the
door
and
open
it
for
her
and
as
she
rapidly
passed
him
eyes
averted
the
faintest
and
sweetest
of
perfumes
was
wafted
upon
his
face
there
he
stood
till
her
return
his
pulses
throbbing
is
my
old
school
atlas
she
said
gaily
always
use
it
still
she
opened
it
upon
the
table
and
bent
forward
wales
you
said
show
me
he
pointed
with
a
finger
that
quivered
his
cheek
was
not
far
from
hers
the
faint
perfume
floated
all
about
him
he
could
imagine
it
the
natural
fragrance
of
her
hair
of
her
breath
see
she
murmured
the
kind
of
place
far
off
but
not
too
far
and
the
railway
station
as
he
did
not
answer
she
half
turned
towards
him
station
alma
chapter
frothingham
was
overjoyed
in
private
talk
with
harvey
she
sang
the
praises
of
her
whom
she
declared
any
man
might
be
proud
to
have
won
for
alma
herself
had
so
much
pride
the
characteristic
said
frothingham
which
had
put
dangers
in
her
path
and
menaced
her
prospects
of
happiness
no
harm
in
saying
rolfe
that
i
never
dared
to
hope
for
this
i
thought
perhaps
that
you
but
i
was
afraid
alma
would
listen
to
any
one
just
of
late
she
seemed
to
feel
her
position
so
much
more
than
at
first
it
was
my
fault
i
behaved
so
foolishly
but
i
sure
you
both
forgive
me
for
months
i
really
was
myself
it
made
the
poor
girl
bitter
against
all
of
us
but
how
noble
she
is
how
and
how
much
much
happier
she
will
be
than
if
she
had
struggled
on
alone
whatever
she
might
have
attained
to
it
was
clear
to
harvey
that
the
lady
did
not
quite
understand
alma
sudden
enthusiasm
for
the
life
that
she
had
but
a
confused
apprehension
of
the
ideal
for
which
alma
panted
but
the
suggestion
of
received
her
entire
approval
feel
sure
you
could
do
better
than
to
go
and
live
in
the
country
for
a
time
there
are
so
many
reasons
why
alma
will
be
happier
there
at
first
than
in
london
i
do
know
whether
that
place
in
north
wales
would
be
quite
but
i
must
meddle
with
what
does
concern
me
and
you
will
be
thoroughly
independent
at
any
moment
you
can
make
a
change
to
a
suggestion
that
she
should
run
down
into
carnarvonshire
and
see
her
proposed
home
before
any
practical
step
was
taken
alma
replied
that
she
had
complete
faith
in
harvey
rolfe
judgment
harvey
only
doubt
was
as
to
the
possibility
of
finding
a
house
he
made
the
journey
himself
and
after
a
few
days
absence
returned
with
no
very
hopeful
report
at
present
there
was
nothing
to
be
had
but
a
cottage
literally
a
cotter
home
and
this
would
not
do
he
brought
photographs
and
alma
went
into
raptures
over
the
lovely
little
bay
with
its
grassy
cliffs
its
rivulet
its
smooth
sand
and
the
mountains
sweeping
nobly
to
a
sheer
buttress
above
the
waves
must
be
a
house
there
be
a
house
of
course
said
harvey
one
could
build
and
cheaply
enough
but
that
meant
a
long
delay
regarding
the
date
of
the
marriage
nothing
was
as
yet
decided
but
harvey
had
made
up
his
mind
to
be
home
for
christmas
when
he
ventured
to
hint
at
this
alma
evaded
the
question
a
correspondent
would
inform
him
if
any
house
became
tenantless
shall
bribe
someone
to
quit
he
cried
might
advertise
that
all
expenses
would
be
paid
with
one
year
rent
of
a
house
elsewhere
harvey
was
in
excellent
spirits
though
time
hung
rather
heavily
on
his
hands
on
an
appointed
day
the
ladies
paid
him
a
visit
at
his
rooms
mrs
handover
requested
to
prepare
tea
for
a
occasion
was
at
once
beset
with
misgivings
and
the
first
sight
of
the
strangers
plunged
her
into
profound
despondency
she
consulted
her
indifferent
relative
buncombe
had
he
any
inkling
of
the
possibility
that
rolfe
was
about
to
change
his
condition
buncombe
knew
nothing
and
cared
nothing
his
own
domestic
affairs
were
giving
him
more
than
usual
anxiety
just
now
did
think
he
was
fool
enough
thus
only
he
replied
to
handover
anxious
questions
alma
surveyed
the
and
took
down
volumes
with
an
air
of
interest
she
looked
over
a
portfolio
of
photographs
inspected
mementoes
of
travel
from
cyprus
palestine
bagdad
frothingham
noted
to
herself
how
dusty
everything
was
woman
neglects
him
scandalously
she
said
afterwards
to
alma
wish
i
had
to
look
after
her
when
she
is
at
work
did
notice
any
neglect
the
tea
was
very
well
made
perhaps
dear
child
the
room
is
in
a
disgraceful
state
never
dusted
never
cleaned
oh
dear
alma
laughed
quite
sure
mamma
you
are
much
happier
now
in
one
way
than
when
you
never
had
to
think
of
such
things
you
have
a
genius
for
domestic
operations
when
i
have
a
house
of
my
own
i
shall
be
rather
afraid
of
you
of
course
you
will
have
good
servants
my
dear
often
have
i
to
tell
you
mamma
that
we
not
going
to
live
in
that
way
at
all
the
simplest
possible
furniture
the
simplest
possible
meals
subordinate
to
the
higher
aims
and
pleasures
you
must
have
servants
alma
you
ca
sweep
the
rooms
yourself
and
do
the
cooking
thinking
about
it
the
girl
answered
gravely
course
i
shall
not
waste
my
time
in
coarse
labour
but
i
feel
sure
we
shall
need
only
one
servant
a
competent
trustworthy
woman
after
your
own
heart
snobbish
to
be
ashamed
of
housework
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
i
should
like
to
do
and
that
every
woman
is
better
for
doing
is
very
true
indeed
alma
i
ca
say
how
i
admire
you
for
such
thoughts
but
thing
is
to
reduce
such
work
to
the
strictly
necessary
think
of
all
the
toil
that
is
wasted
in
people
houses
for
foolish
display
and
luxury
we
sweep
all
that
away
at
one
stroke
wait
till
you
see
thinking
it
out
making
my
plans
in
the
pleasant
little
by
the
fireside
for
it
was
now
october
and
chilly
harvey
and
alma
had
long
long
conversations
occasionally
they
said
things
that
surprised
each
other
and
led
to
explanations
debates
but
harmony
was
never
broken
rolfe
came
away
ever
more
enslaved
more
impressed
by
the
girl
sweet
reasonableness
and
exalted
by
her
glowing
idealism
through
amorous
mists
he
still
endeavoured
to
discern
the
real
alma
he
reflected
ceaselessly
upon
her
character
yet
much
as
she
often
perplexed
him
he
never
saw
reason
to
suspect
her
of
disingenuousness
at
times
she
might
appear
to
excite
herself
unduly
to
fall
into
excess
of
zeal
it
meant
no
doubt
that
the
imaginative
fervour
she
had
been
wont
to
expend
on
music
was
turned
in
a
new
quarter
alma
remained
herself
impulsive
ardent
enthusiastic
whether
yearning
for
public
triumphs
or
eager
to
lead
a
revolution
in
domestic
life
her
health
manifestly
improved
languor
was
unknown
to
her
her
cheeks
had
a
warmer
hue
a
delicate
carnation
subtly
answering
to
her
thoughts
she
abhorred
sentimentality
this
was
one
of
her
first
intimate
declarations
and
harvey
bore
it
in
mind
he
might
praise
glorify
extol
her
to
the
uttermost
and
be
rewarded
by
her
sweetest
smiles
but
for
the
pretty
follies
of
amatory
transport
she
had
no
taste
harvey
ran
small
risk
of
erring
in
this
direction
he
admired
and
reverenced
her
maidenly
aloofness
her
dignity
he
found
an
unfailing
charm
the
great
support
of
his
own
a
caress
was
not
at
all
times
forbidden
but
he
asserted
the
privilege
with
trembling
diffidence
it
pleased
her
when
he
entered
the
room
to
be
stately
and
rather
distant
of
manner
to
greet
him
as
though
they
were
still
on
formal
terms
this
troubled
harvey
at
first
but
he
came
to
understand
and
like
it
in
mrs
frothingham
presence
alma
avoided
every
sign
of
familiarity
and
talked
only
of
indifferent
things
early
in
november
there
came
news
that
a
certain
family
in
the
little
welsh
town
would
be
glad
to
vacate
their
dwelling
if
a
tenant
could
at
once
be
found
for
it
the
same
day
harvey
travelled
northwards
and
on
the
morrow
he
despatched
a
telegram
to
alma
he
had
taken
the
house
and
could
have
possession
in
a
week
or
two
speedily
followed
a
letter
of
description
the
house
was
and
substantial
but
very
plain
it
stood
alone
and
unsheltered
by
the
roadside
a
quarter
of
a
mile
from
the
town
looking
seaward
it
had
garden
ground
and
primitive
stabling
the
rooms
numbered
nine
exclusive
of
kitchen
small
but
not
diminutive
the
people
were
very
friendly
harvey
wrote
and
gave
him
all
aid
in
investigating
the
place
with
a
view
to
repairs
and
so
on
by
remaining
for
a
few
days
he
would
be
able
to
consult
with
a
builder
so
as
to
have
necessary
work
set
in
train
as
soon
as
the
present
occupants
were
gone
alma
engagement
had
been
kept
strictly
secret
when
harvey
returned
after
a
week
of
activity
he
found
her
still
reluctant
to
fix
a
day
or
even
the
month
for
their
wedding
he
did
not
plead
but
wrote
her
a
little
letter
saying
that
the
house
could
be
ready
by
at
all
events
the
second
week
in
december
that
he
would
then
consult
with
her
about
furniture
and
would
go
down
to
superintend
the
final
putting
in
order
that
it
rests
with
you
to
say
when
you
will
enter
into
possession
i
promise
not
to
speak
of
it
again
until
on
coming
into
the
room
i
see
your
atlas
lying
open
on
the
table
that
shall
be
a
sign
unto
me
on
his
return
to
london
he
received
a
note
from
frothingham
requesting
him
to
be
at
home
at
a
certain
hour
as
she
wished
to
call
and
speak
privately
with
him
this
gave
him
an
uneasy
night
he
imagined
all
manner
of
vexatious
or
distracting
possibilities
but
mrs
frothingham
brought
no
ill
news
be
frightened
she
began
reading
his
anxious
face
well
and
i
am
quite
sure
alma
will
soon
have
something
to
say
to
you
i
have
come
on
a
matter
of
business
strictly
business
harvey
felt
a
new
kind
of
uneasiness
me
speak
in
a
plain
way
about
plain
things
pursued
the
widow
with
that
shadow
on
her
face
which
always
indicated
that
she
was
thinking
of
the
mournful
past
know
that
neither
alma
nor
you
would
hear
of
her
accepting
money
from
me
i
know
i
must
speak
of
it
all
the
better
that
you
have
no
need
of
money
but
now
that
you
are
my
relative
will
be
so
very
soon
i
want
to
tell
you
how
my
affairs
stand
will
you
let
me
please
do
impossible
to
refuse
a
hearing
to
the
good
little
woman
who
delighted
in
confidential
gossip
and
for
a
long
time
had
been
anxious
to
pour
these
details
into
harvey
ear
so
she
unfolded
everything
her
capital
at
bennet
frothingham
death
amounted
to
more
than
sixteen
thousand
pounds
excellently
invested
no
stocks
or
shares
of
this
during
the
past
six
months
she
had
given
away
nearly
six
thousand
to
sufferers
by
the
great
catastrophe
her
adviser
and
administrator
in
this
affair
was
an
old
friend
of
her
husband
a
city
man
of
honourable
repute
he
had
taken
great
trouble
to
discover
worthy
recipients
of
her
bounty
and
as
yet
had
kept
the
source
of
it
unknown
must
give
very
much
more
she
said
looking
at
harvey
with
a
pathetic
deprecation
of
criticism
want
to
keep
an
income
of
three
hundred
pounds
i
could
live
on
less
much
less
but
i
should
like
still
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
do
a
little
good
now
and
then
and
i
want
to
be
able
to
leave
something
to
my
sister
or
her
children
the
truth
is
rolfe
no
i
will
call
you
harvey
once
for
all
the
truth
is
i
could
live
now
without
giving
a
little
help
here
and
there
to
people
poorer
than
myself
do
think
it
foolish
her
voice
quivered
feel
that
it
will
be
done
in
the
name
of
my
poor
husband
as
if
he
himself
were
doing
it
and
making
amends
for
a
wrong
he
never
never
intended
if
i
had
given
up
everything
as
some
people
say
i
ought
to
have
done
it
would
have
seemed
the
same
to
me
i
earn
my
own
living
and
what
right
had
i
to
become
a
burden
to
my
relatives
i
hope
i
have
done
very
wrong
of
course
i
shall
give
up
the
flat
as
soon
as
alma
is
married
in
taking
it
i
really
thought
more
of
her
than
of
my
own
comfort
i
shall
live
with
my
sister
and
come
up
to
town
just
now
and
then
when
it
is
necessary
the
listener
was
touched
and
could
only
nod
grave
approval
another
thing
alma
thinks
with
me
in
everything
but
she
says
i
ought
to
let
it
be
known
who
has
given
that
money
she
says
it
would
make
many
people
less
bitter
against
her
father
memory
now
what
is
your
opinion
if
she
is
right
in
that
harvey
would
offer
no
counsel
and
frothingham
did
not
press
him
she
must
think
about
it
the
disclosure
if
wise
could
be
made
at
any
time
all
i
had
to
say
harvey
now
tell
me
about
the
house
and
then
go
arid
see
alma
i
have
business
in
the
city
he
went
but
only
to
be
disappointed
alma
was
not
at
home
to
make
amends
she
sent
him
a
note
that
evening
asking
him
to
call
at
twelve
the
next
day
and
to
stay
to
luncheon
when
he
entered
the
room
the
first
object
his
eye
fell
upon
was
the
old
school
atlas
lying
open
on
the
table
at
the
map
of
england
and
wales
and
the
day
appointed
was
the
twentieth
of
december
the
wedding
was
to
be
the
simplest
conceivable
no
costume
no
bridesmaid
or
hulking
groomsman
no
invitations
no
announcement
to
anyone
until
the
day
had
passed
save
only
to
dora
leach
who
would
be
summoned
as
if
for
some
ordinary
occasion
of
friendship
and
then
be
carried
off
to
the
church
will
insure
my
smiling
all
through
the
ordeal
said
alma
to
her
face
will
be
such
a
study
dear
began
frothingham
very
earnestly
are
sure
than
sure
if
that
possible
and
harvey
throws
up
his
hat
at
being
let
off
so
easily
he
dreaded
the
ceremony
which
was
very
true
though
rolfe
had
not
divulged
it
his
personal
possessions
were
now
to
be
made
ready
for
removal
the
books
represented
nearly
all
that
he
could
carry
away
from
his
old
rooms
but
they
were
a
solid
addendum
to
the
garnishing
of
home
for
a
moment
he
thought
of
selling
a
few
score
of
volumes
would
he
ever
really
want
those
monumental
tomes
the
six
folios
of
muratori
for
instance
which
he
liked
to
possess
but
had
never
used
thereby
hung
the
great
the
unanswerable
question
how
was
he
going
to
spend
his
life
as
a
married
man
was
it
probable
that
he
would
become
a
serious
student
or
even
that
he
would
study
as
much
as
heretofore
no
foreseeing
the
future
must
shape
itself
even
as
the
past
had
done
after
all
why
dismember
his
library
for
the
sake
of
saving
a
few
shillings
on
carriage
if
he
did
not
use
the
books
himself
a
thought
flashed
through
him
which
made
his
brain
unsteady
if
he
did
not
use
the
books
himself
perhaps
he
tried
to
laugh
but
for
five
minutes
was
remarkably
sober
no
no
of
course
he
would
keep
his
library
intact
and
now
there
was
a
duty
to
perform
he
must
write
to
his
friends
make
known
his
marriage
the
letters
to
be
posted
only
on
the
day
of
fate
dear
old
basil
morton
how
he
would
stare
morton
should
soon
come
down
into
wales
and
there
would
be
great
quaffing
and
smoking
and
talking
into
the
small
hours
a
jolly
anticipation
and
hugh
carnaby
hugh
would
throw
up
his
great
arms
clench
his
huge
red
fists
and
roar
with
mocking
laughter
good
old
boy
out
there
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
perhaps
throwing
away
his
money
with
the
deft
help
of
a
swindler
and
the
poor
lad
cecil
morphew
who
assuredly
would
never
pay
back
that
fifty
pounds
to
which
he
was
heartily
welcome
morphew
had
kept
his
promise
to
quit
the
garret
in
chelsea
but
what
was
since
become
of
him
harvey
knew
not
the
project
of
their
going
together
into
wales
had
of
course
fallen
through
lastly
mary
abbott
for
so
had
harvey
come
to
name
his
friend
widow
mary
abbott
how
would
she
receive
this
news
it
would
come
upon
her
as
the
strangest
surprise
not
the
mere
fact
of
his
marrying
but
that
he
had
chosen
for
a
wife
out
of
the
whole
world
the
daughter
of
bennet
frothingham
would
she
be
able
to
think
kindly
of
him
after
this
of
frothingham
she
could
speak
generously
seeming
to
have
outlived
natural
bitterness
but
the
name
must
always
be
unwelcome
to
her
ears
alma
would
cease
to
bear
that
name
and
perhaps
in
days
to
come
mary
abbott
might
forget
it
he
could
only
hope
so
and
that
the
two
women
might
come
together
on
alma
side
surely
no
reluctance
need
be
feared
and
mary
after
her
ordeal
was
giving
proof
of
sense
and
character
which
inspired
a
large
trust
he
would
write
to
her
in
the
most
way
indeed
no
other
tone
was
possible
having
regard
to
the
relations
that
had
grown
up
between
them
how
the
aspect
of
his
little
world
was
changing
a
year
ago
what
things
more
improbable
than
that
he
should
win
alma
frothingham
for
a
wife
and
become
the
cordial
friend
of
mary
abbott
when
the
revelation
could
be
postponed
no
longer
he
made
known
to
mrs
handover
that
he
was
about
to
be
married
it
cost
him
an
extraordinary
effort
for
in
a
double
sense
he
was
shamed
before
the
woman
mrs
handover
by
virtue
of
her
sex
instinctively
triumphed
over
him
he
saw
in
her
foolish
eyes
the
eternal
feminine
victory
his
head
was
bowed
before
her
slatternly
womanhood
then
again
he
shrank
from
announcing
to
the
poor
creature
that
she
could
no
longer
draw
upon
him
for
her
livelihood
very
sorry
rolfe
she
began
in
her
most
despondent
voice
is
of
course
i
very
glad
you
going
to
be
married
and
sure
i
wish
you
every
happiness
i
do
indeed
but
we
are
sorry
to
lose
you
indeed
we
are
of
her
sincerity
herein
there
could
be
no
sort
of
doubt
harvey
coughed
and
looked
at
the
window
which
had
not
been
cleaned
for
some
months
i
ask
without
rudeness
whether
it
is
the
young
lady
who
came
mrs
handover
he
was
uncommonly
glad
that
alma
name
had
never
been
spoken
there
indeed
would
have
been
matter
for
gossip
very
handsome
young
lady
rolfe
and
i
sure
i
wish
her
all
happiness
as
well
as
yourself
she
fidgeted
course
i
do
know
what
your
plans
may
be
sir
but
perhaps
there
no
harm
if
i
mention
it
if
ever
you
should
be
in
need
of
a
housekeeper
you
known
me
a
long
time
sir
yes
certainly
harvey
perspired
course
i
should
bear
you
in
mind
thereupon
he
had
to
listen
whilst
handover
discoursed
at
large
upon
her
dubious
prospects
at
the
close
of
the
interview
he
gave
her
a
cheque
for
ten
pounds
concealed
in
an
envelope
little
present
of
course
i
shall
be
hearing
of
you
every
good
wish
on
the
eve
of
his
marriage
day
he
stood
in
the
dismantled
rooms
at
once
joyful
and
heavy
at
heart
his
books
were
hidden
in
a
score
of
labelled
ready
to
be
sent
away
in
spite
of
open
windows
the
air
was
still
charged
with
dust
since
the
packing
began
everyone
concerned
in
it
had
choked
and
coughed
incessantly
on
the
bare
floor
footsteps
were
impressed
in
a
thick
flocky
deposit
these
rooms
could
have
vied
with
any
in
london
for
supremacy
of
filthiness
yet
here
he
had
known
hours
of
still
contentment
here
he
had
sat
with
friends
congenial
and
heard
the
walls
echo
their
hearty
laughter
here
he
had
felt
at
home
here
his
youth
had
died
where
all
else
was
doubtful
speculative
contingent
that
one
thing
he
certainly
knew
he
was
no
longer
a
young
man
the
years
had
passed
like
a
shadow
unnoted
uncounted
and
had
brought
him
to
this
point
of
pause
of
change
momentous
when
he
must
needs
look
before
and
after
in
all
likelihood
much
more
than
half
his
life
was
gone
his
mother
did
not
see
her
thirtieth
year
his
father
died
at
little
over
forty
his
grandparents
were
not
what
chance
had
he
of
walking
the
earth
for
more
than
half
the
term
already
behind
him
did
the
life
of
every
man
speed
by
so
mockingly
yesterday
a
tomorrow
you
do
say
so
poor
old
fellow
and
he
was
going
to
be
married
incredible
but
a
fact
no
more
the
result
of
deliberate
purpose
than
any
other
change
that
had
come
about
in
his
life
than
the
flight
of
years
and
the
vanishment
of
youth
fate
so
willed
it
and
here
he
stood
someone
climbed
the
stairs
breaking
upon
his
reverie
it
was
buncombe
who
smiled
through
a
settled
gloom
done
i
sha
be
much
longer
here
myself
house
too
big
for
me
it
is
rather
large
thinking
of
you
know
something
about
my
yes
changes
rolfe
had
never
seen
the
man
so
dismal
before
he
tried
to
inspirit
him
but
with
small
result
the
kids
that
bother
me
said
buncombe
then
he
dropped
his
voice
and
brought
his
head
nearer
going
to
get
married
his
eyes
glinted
darkly
going
to
get
divorced
and
with
a
grim
nod
the
man
moved
away
part
the
second
chapter
a
morning
of
april
more
than
two
years
after
his
marriage
found
harvey
rolfe
in
good
health
and
very
tolerable
spirits
as
his
wont
was
he
came
down
at
eight
and
strolled
in
the
open
air
before
breakfast
there
had
been
rain
through
the
night
a
grey
mist
still
clung
about
the
topmost
larches
of
cam
bodvean
and
the
eifel
summits
were
densely
wrapped
but
the
sun
and
breeze
of
spring
promised
to
have
their
way
to
drive
and
melt
the
clouds
to
toss
white
wavelets
on
a
blue
sea
to
make
the
gorse
shine
in
its
glory
and
all
the
hills
be
glad
a
gardener
was
at
work
in
front
of
the
house
harvey
talked
with
him
about
certain
flowers
he
wished
to
grow
this
year
in
the
small
a
lad
was
burnishing
harness
for
him
also
the
master
had
a
friendly
word
before
passing
on
to
look
at
the
little
mare
amid
her
clean
straw
in
his
rough
suit
of
tweed
and
shapeless
garden
hat
with
brown
face
and
cheery
eye
rolfe
moved
hither
and
thither
as
though
native
to
such
a
life
his
figure
had
filled
out
he
was
more
robust
and
looked
indeed
younger
than
on
the
day
when
he
bade
farewell
to
handover
and
her
abominations
at
nine
he
entered
the
where
breakfast
was
ready
though
as
yet
no
other
person
had
come
to
table
the
sun
would
not
touch
this
window
for
several
hours
yet
but
a
crackling
fire
made
the
air
pleasant
and
brightened
all
within
seats
were
placed
for
three
an
aroma
of
coffee
invited
to
the
meal
which
was
characterised
by
no
suggestion
of
asceticism
nor
did
the
equipment
of
the
room
differ
greatly
from
what
is
usual
in
houses
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
was
flanked
with
bronzes
engravings
and
autotypes
hung
about
the
walls
door
and
window
had
their
appropriate
curtaining
the
oak
sideboard
shone
with
requisite
silver
everything
unpretentious
but
no
essential
of
comfort
as
commonly
understood
seemed
to
be
lacking
in
a
minute
or
two
appeared
frothingham
alert
lightsome
much
improved
in
health
since
the
first
year
of
her
widowhood
she
had
been
visiting
here
for
a
fortnight
and
tomorrow
would
return
to
her
home
in
the
south
movement
variety
intimate
gossip
supported
her
under
the
affliction
which
still
seemed
to
be
working
for
her
moral
good
her
bounty
or
restitution
had
long
ago
ceased
to
be
anonymous
but
she
did
not
unduly
pride
herself
upon
the
sacrifice
of
wealth
she
was
glad
to
have
it
known
among
her
acquaintances
because
in
certain
quarters
the
fact
released
her
from
constraint
and
restored
her
to
friendly
intercourse
for
her
needs
and
her
pleasures
a
very
modest
income
proved
quite
sufficient
to
all
appearances
she
found
genuine
and
unfailing
satisfaction
in
the
exercise
of
benevolent
sympathies
will
not
come
down
was
her
remark
as
she
entered
little
headache
nothing
we
are
to
send
her
some
tea
and
dry
toast
thought
she
did
seem
quite
herself
last
night
said
harvey
as
he
cut
into
a
ham
frothingham
made
no
remark
but
smiled
discreetly
taking
a
place
at
the
head
of
the
table
shall
have
to
go
somewhere
harvey
continued
has
been
a
long
winter
she
begins
to
feel
dull
i
afraid
little
perhaps
but
she
quite
well
it
nothing
wo
she
go
on
with
her
she
was
beginning
to
do
really
good
things
then
all
at
once
gives
it
up
she
must
i
think
those
last
sketches
simply
wonderful
anyone
would
suppose
she
had
worked
at
it
all
her
life
instead
of
just
a
few
months
how
very
clever
she
is
can
do
anything
said
harvey
with
genial
conviction
anything
i
really
think
now
let
her
lose
interest
in
it
as
she
did
in
her
music
you
have
only
to
show
that
you
think
her
drawings
good
and
speak
about
them
she
depends
rather
upon
encouragement
know
but
it
was
for
lack
of
encouragement
that
she
dropped
her
violin
unfortunate
oh
she
come
back
to
it
i
sure
when
frothingham
paid
her
first
visit
to
the
couple
it
amused
her
to
find
a
state
of
things
differing
considerably
from
her
anxious
expectations
true
they
had
only
one
servant
within
doors
the
woman
named
ruth
but
she
did
not
represent
the
whole
establishment
having
bought
a
horse
and
trap
and
not
feeling
called
upon
to
act
as
groom
harvey
had
engaged
a
man
who
was
serviceable
in
various
capacities
moreover
a
lad
made
himself
useful
about
the
premises
during
the
day
ruth
was
a
tolerable
cook
and
not
amiss
as
a
housemaid
then
the
furnishing
of
the
house
though
undeniably
left
little
to
be
desired
only
such
things
were
eschewed
as
serve
no
rational
purpose
and
are
mostly
in
people
way
alma
as
could
at
once
be
perceived
ran
no
risk
of
overexerting
herself
in
domestic
duties
she
moved
about
of
mornings
with
and
occasionally
plied
an
unskilful
needle
but
kitchenward
she
never
turned
her
steps
imprudently
frothingham
remarked
that
this
life
after
all
much
resembled
that
of
other
people
whereat
alma
betrayed
a
serious
annoyance
and
the
lady
had
to
apologise
to
admit
the
absence
of
the
homeliness
of
their
diet
the
unmistakable
atmosphere
of
plain
living
and
high
thinking
she
remained
for
nearly
a
month
greatly
enjoying
herself
late
in
autumn
alma
begged
her
to
come
again
and
this
time
the
visit
lasted
longer
for
in
the
first
week
of
december
the
house
received
a
new
inhabitant
whose
arrival
made
much
commotion
alma
did
not
give
birth
to
her
son
without
grave
peril
day
after
day
harvey
strode
about
the
wintry
shore
under
a
cloud
of
dread
however
it
had
been
with
him
a
year
ago
he
was
now
drawn
to
alma
by
something
other
than
the
lures
of
passion
the
manifold
faults
he
had
discerned
in
her
did
not
seriously
conflict
with
her
peculiar
and
charm
and
the
birth
of
her
child
inspired
him
with
a
new
tenderness
an
emotion
different
in
kind
from
any
that
he
had
yet
conceived
that
first
wail
of
feeblest
humanity
through
the
silent
night
made
a
revolution
in
his
thoughts
taught
him
on
the
moment
more
than
he
had
learnt
from
all
his
reading
and
cogitation
it
seemed
to
be
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
that
alma
would
not
nurse
the
baby
only
to
harvey
did
this
appear
a
subject
for
regret
and
he
never
ventured
to
speak
of
it
the
little
mortal
was
not
vigorous
his
nourishment
gave
a
great
deal
of
trouble
but
with
the
coming
of
spring
he
took
a
firmer
hold
on
life
and
less
persistently
bewailed
his
lot
the
names
given
to
him
were
hugh
basil
when
apprised
of
this
the
strong
man
out
in
australia
wrote
a
letter
and
sent
with
it
a
little
lump
of
queensland
gold
to
be
made
into
something
or
kept
intact
as
the
parents
saw
fit
basil
morton
followed
the
old
tradition
and
gave
a
silver
tankard
with
name
and
date
of
the
new
engraved
upon
it
upon
her
recovery
harvey
took
his
wife
to
madeira
where
they
spent
three
weeks
alma
health
needed
nothing
more
than
this
voyage
she
returned
full
of
vitality
during
her
absence
frothingham
superintended
the
household
the
baby
being
in
charge
of
a
competent
nurse
it
occurred
to
harvey
that
this
separation
from
her
child
was
borne
by
alma
with
singular
philosophy
it
did
not
affect
in
the
least
her
enjoyment
of
travel
but
she
reached
home
again
in
joyous
excitement
and
for
a
few
days
kept
the
baby
much
in
view
mrs
frothingham
having
departed
new
visitors
succeeded
each
other
dora
and
gerda
leach
basil
morton
and
his
wife
one
or
two
of
relatives
little
hugh
saw
less
and
less
of
his
mother
but
he
continued
to
thrive
and
harvey
understood
by
now
that
alma
must
not
be
expected
to
take
much
interest
in
the
domestic
side
of
things
it
simply
was
not
her
forte
she
had
ceased
to
play
upon
her
violin
save
for
the
entertainment
and
admiration
of
friends
after
her
return
from
madeira
she
made
the
acquaintance
of
a
lady
skilled
in
drawing
and
herewith
began
a
new
enthusiasm
her
progress
was
remarkable
and
corresponded
to
an
energy
not
less
than
that
she
had
long
ago
put
forth
in
music
in
the
pursuit
of
landscape
she
defied
weather
and
fatigue
she
would
pass
half
the
night
abroad
studying
moonlight
or
rise
at
an
hour
to
catch
the
hues
of
dawn
when
this
ardour
began
to
fail
her
husband
was
vexed
rather
than
surprised
he
knew
alma
characteristic
weakness
and
did
not
like
to
be
so
strongly
reminded
of
it
for
about
this
time
he
was
reading
and
musing
much
on
questions
of
heredity
in
a
moment
of
confidence
he
had
ventured
to
ask
frothingham
whether
she
could
tell
him
anything
of
alma
mother
the
question
though
often
in
his
mind
could
hardly
have
passed
his
lips
had
not
frothingham
led
up
to
it
by
speaking
of
her
own
life
before
she
married
how
she
had
enjoyed
the
cares
of
country
housekeeping
how
little
she
had
dreamt
of
ever
being
rich
how
bennet
frothingham
who
had
known
her
in
his
early
life
sought
her
out
when
he
began
to
be
prosperous
therein
showing
the
fine
qualities
of
his
nature
for
she
had
nothing
in
the
world
but
gentle
birth
and
a
lady
education
alma
was
then
a
young
girl
of
thirteen
and
had
been
motherless
for
eight
years
thus
came
harvey
opportunity
alma
herself
had
already
imparted
to
him
all
she
knew
that
her
mother
was
born
in
england
emigrated
early
with
her
parents
to
australia
returned
to
london
as
a
young
woman
married
and
died
at
to
this
story
frothingham
could
add
little
but
the
supplement
proved
interesting
bennet
frothingham
spoke
of
his
first
marriage
as
a
piece
of
folly
it
resulted
in
unhappiness
yet
the
widow
was
assured
with
no
glaring
fault
on
either
side
alma
mother
was
handsome
and
had
some
natural
gifts
especially
a
good
voice
which
she
tried
to
use
in
public
but
without
success
her
education
scarcely
went
beyond
reading
and
writing
she
died
suddenly
after
an
evening
at
the
theatre
where
as
usual
she
had
excited
herself
beyond
measure
frothingham
had
seen
an
old
report
of
the
inquest
that
was
held
the
cause
of
death
being
given
as
cerebral
haemorrhage
in
these
details
harvey
rolfe
found
new
matter
for
reflection
their
conversation
at
breakfast
this
morning
was
interrupted
by
the
arrival
of
letters
two
of
them
particularly
welcome
for
they
bore
a
colonial
postmark
hugh
carnaby
wrote
to
his
friend
from
an
place
in
tasmania
sibyl
wrote
independently
to
alma
from
hobart
as
i
expected
said
harvey
when
he
had
glanced
over
a
few
lines
talks
of
coming
home
there
seems
no
help
for
it
sibyl
is
much
better
in
health
since
we
left
queens
land
but
i
see
she
would
never
settle
out
here
she
got
to
detest
the
people
at
brisbane
and
does
like
those
at
hobart
much
better
i
have
left
her
there
whilst
i
doing
a
little
roaming
with
a
very
decent
fellow
i
have
come
across
mackintosh
by
name
he
has
been
everywhere
and
done
everything
not
long
ago
was
in
the
service
of
the
telegraph
company
at
tehran
and
afterwards
lived
this
will
interest
you
at
badgered
where
he
got
a
which
marks
his
face
and
testifies
to
his
veracity
he
has
been
trying
to
start
a
timber
business
here
says
some
of
the
hard
woods
would
be
just
the
thing
for
street
paving
but
now
his
father
death
is
taking
him
back
home
and
i
should
wonder
if
we
travel
together
one
of
his
ideas
is
a
bicycle
factory
he
seems
to
know
all
about
it
and
says
it
be
the
most
business
in
england
for
years
to
come
what
do
you
think
does
this
offer
a
chance
for
harvey
interrupted
himself
with
a
laugh
smelting
of
abandoned
gold
ores
by
the
method
of
the
ingenious
dando
had
absorbed
some
of
capital
with
very
little
result
and
his
other
schemes
for
were
numerous
the
fact
is
i
must
get
money
somehow
living
has
been
expensive
ever
since
we
left
england
and
it
madness
to
go
on
till
one
resources
have
practically
run
out
and
sibyl
get
home
again
wasting
her
life
among
these
people
how
does
she
write
to
your
wife
i
rather
wish
i
could
spy
at
the
letters
of
course
i
do
seriously
mean
that
she
bears
it
very
well
and
if
possible
i
have
a
higher
opinion
of
her
than
ever
again
harvey
laughed
old
chap
what
a
pity
he
ca
be
cracking
crowns
somewhere
i
sure
i
rather
see
him
making
bicycles
his
vocation
he
ought
to
go
somewhere
and
get
up
a
little
war
of
his
own
as
he
once
told
me
he
should
like
to
we
ca
do
without
the
fighting
man
you
bring
hughie
up
to
it
then
harvey
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
point
far
off
fear
he
wo
have
the
bone
and
muscle
but
i
should
like
him
to
have
the
pluck
i
afraid
he
may
for
i
a
vile
coward
myself
should
like
a
child
never
to
hear
or
know
of
war
said
mrs
frothingham
fervently
so
should
i
harvey
answered
in
a
graver
tone
when
frothingham
went
upstairs
with
the
letter
for
alma
he
broke
open
another
envelope
it
was
from
mary
abbott
who
wrote
to
him
twice
a
year
when
she
acknowledged
the
receipt
of
his
cheque
she
sent
the
usual
careful
report
concerning
wager
children
the
girl
now
seven
years
old
and
the
boy
nine
albert
wager
she
thought
was
getting
too
old
for
her
he
ought
to
go
to
a
boys
school
neither
he
nor
his
sister
had
as
yet
repaid
the
care
given
to
them
never
were
children
more
difficult
to
manage
harvey
read
this
between
the
lines
for
mary
abbott
never
complained
of
the
task
she
had
undertaken
he
rose
and
left
the
room
with
a
face
of
anxious
thoughtfulness
the
day
was
wont
to
pass
in
a
pretty
regular
routine
from
nine
to
one
harvey
sat
alone
in
his
study
not
always
energetically
studious
but
on
the
whole
making
progress
in
his
chosen
field
of
knowledge
he
bought
books
freely
and
still
used
the
london
library
of
late
he
had
been
occupying
himself
with
the
authorities
on
education
working
often
impatiently
through
many
a
volume
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
on
this
subject
with
mary
abbott
but
had
not
yet
found
courage
to
speak
of
her
paying
them
a
visit
the
situation
difficult
because
of
alma
parentage
was
made
more
awkward
by
his
reticence
with
alma
regarding
the
payment
he
made
for
those
luckless
children
the
longer
he
kept
silence
the
less
easily
could
he
acquaint
his
wife
with
this
matter
in
itself
so
perfectly
harmless
this
morning
he
felt
indisposed
for
study
and
cared
just
as
little
to
go
out
notwithstanding
the
magnificent
sky
from
his
windows
he
looked
upon
the
slopes
of
cam
bodvean
their
beauty
only
reminded
him
of
grander
and
lovelier
scenes
in
countries
from
time
to
time
the
wanderer
thus
awoke
in
him
and
threw
scorn
upon
the
pedantries
of
a
room
he
had
moreover
his
hours
of
regret
for
vanished
conviviality
he
wished
to
step
out
into
a
london
street
collect
his
and
hold
revel
in
the
bygone
way
these
however
were
still
but
fugitive
moods
all
in
all
he
regretted
nothing
destiny
seemed
to
have
marked
him
for
a
bookish
man
he
grew
more
methodical
more
persistent
in
his
historical
reading
this
doubtless
was
the
appointed
course
for
his
latter
years
it
led
to
nothing
definite
his
life
would
be
fruitless
fruitless
there
sounded
from
somewhere
in
the
house
a
shrill
little
cry
arresting
his
thought
and
controverting
it
without
a
syllable
nay
fruitless
his
life
could
not
be
if
his
child
grew
up
only
the
chosen
few
the
infinitesimal
minority
of
mankind
leave
spiritual
offspring
or
set
their
single
mark
upon
the
earth
the
multitude
are
but
parents
of
a
new
generation
live
but
to
perpetuate
the
race
it
is
the
will
of
nature
the
common
lot
and
if
indeed
it
lay
within
his
power
to
shape
a
path
for
this
new
life
which
he
nature
slave
had
called
out
of
nothingness
to
obviate
one
error
to
avert
one
misery
to
ensure
that
in
however
slight
degree
his
son
existence
should
be
better
and
happier
than
his
own
was
not
this
a
sufficing
purpose
for
the
years
that
remained
to
him
a
recompense
adequate
to
any
effort
any
sacrifice
as
he
sat
thus
in
reverie
the
door
softly
opened
and
alma
looked
in
upon
him
i
interrupt
you
idling
how
is
your
headache
she
answered
with
a
careless
gesture
and
came
forward
a
letter
in
her
hand
says
she
will
certainly
be
starting
for
home
in
a
few
weeks
perhaps
they
on
the
way
by
now
you
have
the
same
news
i
hear
they
must
come
to
us
straight
away
replied
harvey
knocking
the
ash
out
of
his
pipe
suppose
we
go
to
meet
them
if
they
come
by
the
orient
line
they
call
at
naples
how
would
it
be
to
go
overland
and
make
the
voyage
back
with
them
alma
seemed
to
like
the
suggestion
and
smiled
but
only
for
a
moment
she
had
little
colour
this
morning
and
looked
cold
as
she
drew
up
to
the
fire
holding
a
white
woollen
wrap
about
her
shoulders
a
slow
and
subtle
modification
of
her
features
was
tending
to
a
mature
beauty
which
would
make
bolder
claim
than
the
charm
that
had
characterised
her
in
maidenhood
it
was
still
remote
from
beauty
of
a
sensual
type
but
the
outlines
in
becoming
a
little
more
rounded
more
regular
gained
in
common
estimate
what
they
lost
to
a
more
refined
apprehension
her
eyes
appeared
more
deliberately
conscious
of
their
depth
and
gleam
her
lips
less
responsive
to
the
flying
thought
grew
to
an
habitual
expression
not
of
discontent
but
something
akin
unto
it
not
of
but
something
that
spoke
a
spirit
neither
tranquil
nor
pliant
you
anything
else
she
asked
absently
letter
from
mrs
abbott
alma
smiled
with
a
shade
of
pleasantry
not
usual
upon
her
countenance
harvey
generally
read
her
extracts
from
these
letters
their
allusion
to
money
imposed
the
reserve
otherwise
they
would
have
passed
into
alma
hands
from
his
masculine
point
of
view
harvey
thought
the
matter
indifferent
nothing
in
his
wife
behaviour
hitherto
had
led
him
to
suppose
that
she
attached
importance
to
it
usual
report
of
progress
i
fancy
those
two
children
are
giving
her
a
good
deal
of
trouble
she
have
to
send
the
boy
to
a
boarding
school
can
she
afford
it
do
know
never
understood
yet
why
you
take
so
much
interest
in
those
children
her
eyes
rested
upon
him
with
a
peculiarly
keen
scrutiny
and
harvey
resenting
the
embarrassment
due
to
his
own
tactics
showed
a
slight
impatience
partly
because
i
wish
to
help
abbott
with
advice
if
i
can
partly
because
i
interested
in
the
whole
question
of
education
it
interesting
of
course
she
has
holidays
i
suppose
holiday
time
with
her
now
why
do
you
ask
her
to
come
and
see
us
would
at
once
harvey
replied
with
hesitation
i
felt
sure
that
he
broke
off
and
altered
the
turn
of
his
sentence
know
whether
she
can
leave
those
children
were
going
to
make
a
different
objection
of
course
there
a
little
awkwardness
but
you
said
long
ago
that
all
that
sort
of
thing
would
wear
away
and
surely
it
ought
to
have
done
by
now
if
abbott
is
as
sensible
as
you
think
i
do
see
how
she
can
have
any
unpleasant
feeling
towards
me
ca
suppose
that
she
has
now
is
the
opportunity
send
an
why
should
i
write
it
myself
alma
had
quite
shaken
off
the
appearance
of
lassitude
she
drew
herself
up
looked
towards
the
and
showed
characteristic
eagerness
to
carry
out
a
project
though
doubtful
of
the
result
harvey
assented
without
any
sign
of
reluctance
and
forthwith
she
moved
to
the
desk
in
a
few
minutes
she
had
penned
a
letter
which
was
held
out
for
her
husband
perusal
he
exclaimed
be
better
quod
tetigit
non
pray
what
does
that
mean
asked
alma
her
countenance
a
trifle
perturbed
by
the
emotions
which
blended
with
her
delight
in
praise
my
wife
is
the
most
graceful
of
women
and
imparts
to
all
she
touches
something
of
her
own
charm
that
you
must
know
is
the
language
of
compression
they
parted
with
a
laugh
as
she
left
the
study
alma
saw
her
little
son
just
going
out
the
nurse
had
placed
him
in
his
where
he
sat
smiling
and
cooing
frothingham
who
delighted
in
the
child
had
made
ready
for
a
walk
in
the
same
direction
and
from
the
doorway
called
to
alma
to
accompany
them
may
come
after
you
perhaps
was
the
reply
hughie
with
a
wave
of
her
hand
alma
passed
into
the
where
she
stood
at
the
window
watching
till
frothingham
sunshade
had
disappeared
then
she
moved
about
like
one
in
search
of
occupation
taking
up
a
book
only
to
throw
it
down
again
gazing
vacantly
at
a
picture
or
giving
a
touch
to
a
bowl
of
flowers
here
as
in
the
only
the
absence
of
conventional
superfluities
called
for
remark
each
article
of
furniture
was
in
simple
taste
the
result
an
impression
of
plain
elegance
on
a
little
corner
table
lay
together
with
a
a
and
the
portfolio
which
contained
chosen
examples
of
her
work
not
far
away
locked
in
its
case
lay
her
violin
the
instrument
she
had
been
wont
to
touch
caressingly
today
her
eyes
shunned
it
she
went
out
again
into
the
little
hall
the
front
door
stood
open
sunshine
flooded
the
garden
but
alma
was
not
tempted
to
go
forth
all
the
walks
and
drives
of
the
neighbourhood
had
become
drearily
familiar
the
meanest
of
london
streets
shone
by
contrast
as
a
paradise
in
her
imagination
with
a
deep
sigh
of
ennui
she
turned
and
slowly
ascended
the
stairs
above
were
six
rooms
three
of
them
the
principal
chambers
her
own
harvey
and
the
then
the
the
night
nursery
and
the
servant
bedroom
on
her
first
coming
she
had
thought
the
house
needlessly
spacious
now
it
often
seemed
to
her
oppressively
small
there
being
but
one
spare
room
for
visitors
she
entered
her
own
room
it
could
not
be
called
disorderly
yet
it
lacked
that
scrupulous
perfection
of
arrangement
that
dainty
finish
which
makes
an
atmosphere
for
the
privacy
of
a
certain
type
of
woman
ruth
had
done
her
part
preserving
purity
unimpeachable
the
deficiency
was
due
to
alma
alone
to
be
sure
she
had
neither
nor
and
something
in
alma
constitution
made
it
difficult
for
her
to
dispense
with
such
aids
to
the
complete
life
she
stood
before
the
mirror
and
looked
at
herself
blankly
gloomily
her
eyes
fell
a
little
and
took
a
new
expression
that
of
anxious
scrutiny
gazing
still
she
raised
her
arms
much
as
though
she
were
standing
to
be
measured
by
a
dressmaker
then
she
turned
so
as
to
obtain
a
view
of
her
figure
sideways
her
arms
fell
again
apathetically
and
she
moved
away
somehow
the
long
morning
passed
in
the
afternoon
she
drove
with
harvey
and
frothingham
conversing
much
as
usual
giving
no
verbal
hint
of
her
overwhelming
ennui
no
reference
was
made
to
abbott
harvey
had
himself
written
her
a
letter
supporting
alma
invitation
with
all
possible
cordiality
but
he
gravely
feared
that
she
would
not
come
at
tea
according
to
custom
little
hugh
was
brought
into
the
room
to
be
fondled
by
his
mother
who
liked
to
see
him
when
he
was
prettily
dressed
and
to
sit
upon
his
father
knee
hugh
aged
sixteen
months
began
to
have
a
vocabulary
of
his
own
and
to
claim
a
share
in
conversation
he
had
a
large
head
well
formed
and
slight
but
shapely
limbs
the
sweet
air
of
sea
and
mountain
gave
a
healthful
though
very
delicate
colouring
to
his
cheeks
his
eyes
were
alma
dark
and
gleaming
but
with
promise
of
a
keener
intelligence
harvey
liked
to
gaze
long
at
the
little
face
puzzled
by
its
frequent
gravity
delighted
by
its
flashes
of
mirth
syllables
of
set
him
musing
and
philosophising
how
fresh
and
young
yet
how
wondrously
old
babble
such
as
this
fell
from
a
child
lips
thousands
of
years
ago
in
the
morning
of
the
world
it
sounded
on
through
the
ages
infinitely
reproduced
eternally
a
new
beginning
the
same
music
of
earliest
human
speech
the
same
ripple
of
innocent
laughter
renewed
from
generation
to
generation
but
he
listening
had
not
the
merry
fearless
pride
of
fathers
in
an
earlier
day
upon
him
lay
the
burden
of
all
time
he
must
needs
ponder
anxiously
on
his
child
heritage
use
his
weary
knowledge
to
cast
the
horoscope
of
this
dawning
life
are
you
looking
at
him
in
that
way
exclaimed
alma
frighten
him
did
i
look
if
you
saw
something
dreadful
harvey
laughed
and
ran
his
fingers
through
the
soft
curls
and
bade
himself
be
of
good
heart
had
he
not
thrown
scorn
upon
people
who
make
a
about
their
children
had
he
not
despised
and
detested
chatter
about
babies
to
his
old
self
what
a
simpleton
would
he
have
seemed
on
the
morrow
frothingham
took
her
departure
leaving
it
as
usual
uncertain
when
she
would
come
again
but
pleasantly
assured
that
it
could
not
be
very
long
she
thought
harvey
the
best
of
husbands
he
and
alma
the
happiest
of
married
folk
in
secret
no
doubt
she
sadly
envied
them
if
her
own
lot
had
fallen
in
such
tranquil
places
two
more
days
and
alma
received
a
reply
to
her
invitation
yes
mrs
abbott
would
come
and
be
with
them
for
a
week
longer
she
could
not
her
letter
was
amiable
and
as
alma
own
harvey
felt
a
great
relief
and
it
pleased
him
not
a
little
to
see
his
unfeigned
satisfaction
this
was
monday
the
visitor
promised
to
arrive
on
tuesday
evening
course
you
drive
over
with
me
to
meet
her
said
harvey
think
not
i
dislike
making
acquaintance
at
railway
stations
if
it
should
rain
you
have
to
have
a
covered
carriage
and
imagine
us
three
shut
up
together
alma
laughed
gaily
at
the
idea
harvey
though
at
a
loss
to
interpret
her
merriment
answered
it
with
a
smile
and
said
no
more
happily
the
weather
was
settled
the
sun
shone
gallantly
each
morning
and
on
tuesday
afternoon
harvey
drove
the
seven
miles
up
hill
and
down
between
hedges
of
gorse
and
woods
of
larch
to
the
little
where
mary
abbott
would
alight
after
her
long
journey
chapter
half
an
hour
after
sunset
alma
heard
the
approach
of
wheels
she
had
long
been
ready
to
receive
her
visitor
and
when
the
horse
stopped
she
stood
by
the
open
door
of
the
commanding
her
nervousness
resolute
to
make
an
impression
of
grace
and
dignity
it
would
have
eased
her
mind
had
she
been
able
to
form
some
idea
of
personal
appearance
harvey
had
never
dropped
a
hint
on
the
subject
and
she
could
not
bring
herself
to
question
him
the
bell
rang
ruth
hastened
to
answer
it
harvey
voice
sounded
turns
chilly
after
the
warm
sunshine
i
afraid
we
ought
to
have
had
a
covered
carriage
i
should
have
seen
nothing
was
replied
in
softer
tones
drive
was
most
enjoyable
there
came
into
the
lamplight
a
rather
tall
figure
in
plain
serviceable
alma
discerned
a
face
which
gave
her
a
shock
of
surprise
so
unlike
was
it
to
anything
she
had
imagined
the
features
regular
and
of
intelligent
expression
but
so
thin
pallid
worn
that
they
seemed
to
belong
to
a
woman
of
nearly
forty
weighted
by
years
of
extreme
suffering
the
demeanour
which
alma
had
studiously
prepared
underwent
an
immediate
change
she
stepped
forward
with
an
air
of
frank
kindliness
of
cordial
hospitality
your
train
late
how
tired
you
must
be
and
how
cold
in
these
fine
spring
days
we
have
been
living
as
if
it
were
midsummer
but
sure
you
ought
to
have
had
that
long
drive
in
the
open
trap
so
late
harvey
thinks
everybody
as
robust
as
himself
but
the
guest
was
in
very
good
spirits
though
manifestly
fatigued
she
spoke
with
pleasure
of
the
beautiful
wild
country
glowing
in
sunset
a
little
tired
yes
she
had
not
travelled
so
far
for
a
long
time
but
the
air
had
braced
her
wonderfully
and
after
a
night
rest
at
dinner
alma
behaved
with
the
same
friendliness
closely
observing
her
guest
and
listening
to
all
she
said
as
if
anxious
not
to
miss
a
word
abbott
conversed
in
a
very
low
voice
her
manner
was
marked
by
a
subdual
which
might
partly
be
attributable
to
weariness
but
seemed
in
a
measure
the
result
of
timidity
under
novel
circumstances
if
she
looked
at
either
of
her
companions
her
eyes
were
instantly
withdrawn
a
smile
never
lingered
on
her
features
it
came
and
passed
leaving
the
set
expression
of
preoccupied
gravity
she
wore
a
dress
of
black
silk
close
at
the
neck
and
alma
perceived
that
it
was
by
no
means
new
an
hour
after
the
meal
she
begged
permission
to
retire
to
her
room
the
effort
to
talk
had
become
impossible
she
was
at
the
end
of
her
strength
and
could
hold
up
no
longer
when
alma
came
down
again
she
stood
for
a
minute
before
the
fire
smiling
and
silent
harvey
had
picked
up
a
newspaper
he
said
nothing
very
nice
she
is
fell
at
length
from
rolfe
lips
altered
was
her
husband
murmured
reply
in
what
way
so
wretchedly
ill
for
one
thing
must
take
her
about
what
do
you
think
of
doing
tomorrow
by
feminine
device
of
indirect
question
alma
obtained
some
understanding
of
the
change
that
had
come
upon
abbott
during
the
past
three
years
harvey
disclosures
did
not
violate
the
reticence
imposed
upon
him
by
that
hour
in
which
he
had
beheld
a
remorseful
anguish
he
spoke
only
of
such
things
as
were
manifest
to
everyone
who
had
known
mary
abbott
before
her
husband
death
of
her
social
pleasures
her
intellectual
ambitions
suddenly
overwhelmed
by
a
great
sorrow
suppose
she
ought
to
be
doing
much
better
things
than
teaching
children
said
alma
things
repeated
harvey
musing
do
know
it
all
depends
how
you
regard
it
she
very
clever
appallingly
he
answered
with
a
laugh
very
possible
she
is
doing
just
what
she
ought
to
be
neither
more
nor
less
her
health
seems
to
be
the
weak
point
you
think
she
has
enough
to
live
upon
harvey
knitted
his
brows
and
looked
uneasy
hope
so
of
course
it
must
be
a
very
small
income
but
i
dare
say
those
friends
of
hers
at
gunnersbury
make
life
a
little
easier
feel
quite
sorry
for
her
said
alma
with
cheerfulness
realised
her
position
we
must
make
her
stay
as
long
as
she
can
yes
if
it
fine
again
we
might
drive
to
caeri
that
would
interest
her
no
doubt
she
likes
history
does
she
the
same
things
that
you
are
fond
of
at
breakfast
abbott
appeared
with
a
much
brighter
countenance
refreshed
in
body
and
mind
she
entered
gladly
into
the
plans
that
had
been
made
for
the
day
talked
with
less
restraint
and
showed
an
interest
in
all
her
surroundings
but
her
demeanour
still
had
the
air
of
which
seemed
at
moments
to
become
a
diffidence
bordering
on
humility
this
was
emphasised
by
its
contrast
with
the
bearing
of
her
hostess
alma
had
never
shown
herself
to
more
brilliant
advantage
kind
interpretation
might
have
thought
that
she
had
set
herself
to
inspirit
the
guest
in
every
possible
way
her
face
was
radiant
with
good
humour
and
vivacity
she
looked
the
incarnation
of
joyous
healthy
life
the
flow
of
her
spirited
talk
seemed
to
aim
at
exhibiting
the
joys
and
privileges
of
existence
in
places
such
as
this
she
represented
herself
as
glorying
in
the
mountain
heights
and
in
solitary
tracts
of
shore
here
were
no
social
burdens
or
restrictions
or
extravagances
one
lived
naturally
simply
without
regrets
for
wasted
time
and
without
fear
of
the
morrow
to
all
this
mary
abbott
paid
the
tribute
of
her
admiration
perhaps
of
her
envy
and
alma
grew
the
more
animated
the
more
she
felt
that
she
had
impressed
her
hearer
harvey
wondered
at
this
sudden
revival
of
his
wife
drooping
energies
but
he
did
not
consider
the
phenomenon
too
curiously
enough
that
alma
was
brilliant
and
delightful
that
she
played
her
part
of
hostess
to
perfection
and
communicated
to
their
guest
something
of
her
own
vitality
they
had
an
exhilarating
drive
through
the
mountains
to
caeri
a
british
fastness
on
a
stern
bare
height
crumbled
dwellings
amid
their
great
protecting
walls
with
cairn
and
cromlech
and
mystic
circles
where
in
old
time
the
noise
of
battle
clanged
amid
these
grey
hills
now
sleeping
in
sunlight
and
from
caeri
down
into
the
rocky
gloom
of
the
seaward
chasm
nant
gwrtheyrn
with
its
mound
upon
the
desolate
shore
called
by
legend
the
of
vortigern
here
abbott
spoke
of
the
prehistoric
monuments
she
had
seen
in
brittany
causing
alma
to
glance
at
her
with
a
sudden
surprise
the
impulse
was
very
significant
thinking
of
her
guest
only
as
a
teacher
of
children
alma
forgot
for
the
moment
that
this
subdued
woman
had
known
happier
days
when
she
too
boasted
of
liberty
and
stored
her
mind
in
travel
after
all
as
soon
appeared
the
travels
had
been
of
very
modest
extent
and
alma
with
her
knowledge
of
many
european
countries
and
her
recent
ocean
voyage
regained
the
confident
superiority
which
kept
her
in
such
admirable
humour
mary
abbott
reluctant
to
converse
on
things
that
regarded
herself
afforded
alma
every
opportunity
of
shining
she
knew
of
skill
as
a
musician
and
this
same
evening
uttered
a
hope
that
she
might
hear
her
play
the
violin
came
forth
from
its
retirement
playing
it
seemed
at
first
without
much
earnestness
as
though
it
were
but
a
pastime
alma
presently
chose
one
of
her
pageant
pieces
and
showed
of
what
she
was
capable
lack
of
practice
had
told
upon
her
hand
but
the
hearers
were
uncritical
as
she
well
knew
magnificent
said
harvey
with
a
mischievous
smile
do
condescend
now
to
the
primitive
ear
let
us
have
something
of
less
severity
alma
glanced
at
abbott
who
had
softly
murmured
her
thanks
then
turned
an
eye
upon
her
husband
saying
wickedly
sweet
home
no
doubt
you
could
play
it
wonderfully
as
you
would
three
blind
mice
alma
looked
disdain
and
chose
next
a
tarantelle
of
schubert
the
exertion
of
playing
brought
warm
colour
into
her
face
it
heightened
her
beauty
and
she
was
conscious
of
it
so
that
when
she
chanced
to
find
abbott
look
fixed
upon
her
a
boundless
gratification
flashed
from
her
own
dark
eyes
and
spoke
in
the
quiver
of
her
lips
next
evening
when
again
requested
to
play
she
sat
down
to
the
piano
on
this
instrument
alma
had
not
the
same
confidence
as
with
the
violin
but
she
could
not
refrain
from
exhibiting
such
skill
as
she
possessed
abbott
having
declared
that
her
own
was
elementary
meantime
the
portfolio
of
had
of
course
been
produced
for
exhibition
in
this
art
though
she
did
not
admit
it
abbott
had
formerly
made
some
progress
she
was
able
to
form
a
judgment
of
alma
powers
and
heard
with
genuine
surprise
in
how
short
a
time
this
point
had
been
attained
alma
again
glowed
with
satisfaction
she
found
a
new
source
of
pride
in
her
motherhood
not
having
been
told
or
having
forgotten
that
abbott
had
lost
a
child
she
playfully
offered
assurance
that
the
guest
should
not
be
worried
with
nursery
talk
are
anything
but
a
delight
to
you
i
afraid
you
must
have
too
much
of
them
often
give
me
trouble
abbott
replied
i
wish
i
had
one
more
to
trouble
me
my
little
girl
would
have
been
six
years
old
by
now
alma
gave
one
of
those
looks
which
occasionally
atoned
for
many
less
amiable
glances
so
sorry
i
did
know
abbott
did
not
dwell
on
the
subject
her
reserve
was
still
unbroken
though
there
never
appeared
the
least
coldness
in
her
manner
she
talked
with
perfect
freedom
of
everything
that
contained
no
allusion
to
herself
the
change
was
manifestly
doing
her
good
even
by
the
second
day
she
showed
an
increase
of
vigour
and
no
longer
wore
the
preoccupied
overstrained
look
becoming
familiar
with
her
face
alma
thought
it
more
attractive
than
at
first
and
decidedly
younger
she
still
had
a
great
deal
of
curiosity
to
satisfy
with
regard
to
mrs
abbott
especially
it
seemed
strange
to
her
that
harvey
and
his
friend
were
so
little
inclined
for
conversation
they
talked
only
of
formal
uninteresting
things
and
she
wondered
whether
after
all
they
really
had
much
in
common
abbott
for
a
walk
tomorrow
morning
she
said
in
private
must
have
so
many
things
to
talk
about
by
yourselves
do
know
that
we
have
harvey
returned
looking
at
her
with
some
surprise
want
to
hear
a
little
more
about
those
youngsters
all
abbott
wished
to
climb
cam
bodvean
the
great
hill
clad
in
tender
green
of
which
overlooked
the
town
for
the
toil
of
this
ascent
alma
had
no
mind
pleasantly
excusing
herself
she
proposed
at
breakfast
that
harvey
and
abbott
should
go
alone
they
might
descend
on
the
far
side
of
the
mountain
and
there
at
a
certain
point
known
to
her
husband
she
would
meet
them
with
the
dogcart
harvey
understood
this
to
mean
that
the
man
would
drive
her
for
alma
had
not
yet
added
the
art
of
driving
to
her
various
accomplishments
she
was
indeed
timid
with
the
reins
he
readily
assented
to
the
plan
which
for
some
reason
appeared
to
amuse
and
exhilarate
her
be
in
a
hurry
she
said
be
a
good
view
on
a
day
like
this
and
you
can
have
a
long
rest
at
the
top
if
you
meet
me
at
one
we
shall
be
back
for
lunch
at
two
when
they
started
alma
came
out
to
the
garden
gate
and
dismissed
them
with
smiling
benignity
one
might
have
expected
her
to
say
good
as
when
children
are
trusted
to
take
a
walk
without
superintendence
on
she
ran
quickly
to
an
upper
room
where
from
the
window
she
could
observe
them
for
a
few
minutes
as
they
went
along
in
conversation
presently
she
bade
her
servant
give
directions
for
the
dogcart
to
be
brought
round
at
one
to
drive
said
ruth
who
had
heard
something
of
the
talk
at
breakfast
alma
replied
with
decision
shall
drive
myself
the
pedestrians
took
their
way
along
a
winding
road
between
boulder
walls
with
the
new
leaves
of
pennywort
then
crossed
the
one
long
street
of
the
town
better
named
a
village
passing
the
fountain
overbuilt
with
lichened
stone
where
women
and
children
filled
their
cans
with
sweet
water
sparkling
in
the
golden
light
rolfe
now
and
then
received
a
respectful
greeting
he
had
wished
to
speak
welsh
but
soon
abandoned
the
endeavour
he
liked
to
hear
it
especially
on
the
lips
of
children
at
their
play
an
old
old
language
symbol
of
the
vitality
of
a
race
sounding
on
those
young
lips
as
in
the
time
when
his
own
english
composite
hybrid
had
not
yet
begun
to
shape
itself
beyond
the
street
and
a
row
of
cottages
they
began
to
climb
at
first
a
gentle
ascent
on
either
hand
high
hedges
of
flowering
blackthorn
banks
strewn
with
primroses
and
violets
and
starred
with
the
white
stitchwort
great
leaves
of
foxglove
giving
promise
for
future
days
the
air
was
bland
yet
exquisitely
fresh
scented
from
innumerable
sources
in
field
and
heath
and
wood
when
the
lane
gave
upon
open
ground
they
made
a
pause
to
look
back
beneath
them
lay
the
little
grey
town
and
beyond
it
the
grassy
cliffs
curving
about
a
blue
bay
near
by
rose
the
craggy
slopes
of
a
bare
hill
and
beyond
it
a
few
miles
to
the
north
two
lofty
peaks
wreathed
against
the
cloudless
heaven
with
rosy
mist
it
wo
be
too
much
for
you
said
harvey
looking
upwards
to
the
wooded
height
feel
equal
to
anything
answered
his
companion
brightly
air
has
given
me
new
life
there
was
a
faint
colour
on
her
cheeks
and
for
the
first
time
harvey
caught
an
expression
which
reminded
him
of
the
face
he
had
known
years
ago
when
abbott
looked
upon
life
much
as
alma
did
now
they
entered
upon
a
rising
heath
green
with
mosses
where
the
moisture
of
a
hidden
stream
drew
downwards
brown
with
dead
bracken
on
dry
slopes
just
above
was
a
great
thicket
of
flowering
gorse
a
blaze
of
colour
pure
aerial
as
that
of
the
sky
which
illumined
it
through
this
they
made
their
way
then
dropped
into
a
green
nook
of
pasture
among
sheep
that
raised
their
heads
distrustfully
and
lambs
each
running
to
its
mother
you
can
scale
this
wall
it
will
save
us
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
can
i
can
was
the
laughing
reply
protruding
boulders
made
it
an
easy
clamber
they
were
then
at
the
base
of
cam
bodvean
and
before
them
rose
steep
mountain
glades
abbott
gazed
upwards
with
unspoken
delight
are
no
paths
said
harvey
honest
woodland
some
day
it
will
be
laid
out
with
roads
and
iron
benches
with
to
the
summit
think
so
of
course
it
the
destiny
of
every
beautiful
spot
in
britain
there
be
a
pier
down
yonder
and
a
switchback
railway
and
leagues
of
and
brass
bands
us
hope
we
shall
be
dead
but
those
who
come
after
us
what
sort
of
a
world
will
it
be
for
hugh
i
often
think
i
should
be
wrong
if
i
taught
him
to
see
life
as
i
do
is
it
only
preparing
misery
for
him
i
ought
to
make
him
delight
in
piers
and
nigger
minstrels
and
switchbacks
a
man
should
belong
to
his
time
a
man
helps
to
make
his
time
replied
mary
abbott
you
are
hopeful
are
you
try
very
hard
to
be
what
use
am
i
if
i
do
put
a
few
thoughts
into
children
heads
which
will
help
to
make
their
lives
a
little
better
harvey
nodded
their
feet
sank
in
the
mossy
ruin
of
immemorial
summers
overhead
the
dangled
green
tresses
or
a
grove
of
beech
shook
sunlight
through
branches
decked
with
translucent
gold
now
and
then
they
came
out
into
open
spaces
where
trees
rent
from
the
soil
dead
amid
spring
leafage
told
of
a
great
winter
storm
new
grass
grew
thickly
about
the
shattered
trunks
and
in
the
hollows
whence
the
roots
had
been
torn
one
moment
they
stood
in
shadow
the
next
moved
upward
into
a
great
splash
of
sunshine
thrown
upon
moss
that
still
glistened
with
the
dews
of
the
night
and
on
splints
of
crag
painted
green
and
gold
with
lichen
sun
or
shadow
the
sweet
breathed
upon
their
faces
mingled
with
many
a
waft
of
perfume
from
little
woodland
plants
more
than
once
abbott
had
to
pause
midway
she
was
tempted
by
a
singular
it
was
a
larch
tree
perhaps
thirty
feet
high
at
the
beginning
of
its
growth
the
stem
had
by
some
natural
means
been
so
diverted
as
to
grow
horizontally
for
a
yard
or
more
at
a
couple
of
feet
above
the
ground
it
had
then
made
a
curve
downwards
and
finally
by
way
of
a
perfect
loop
across
itself
had
shot
again
in
the
true
direction
growing
at
last
with
straight
and
noble
trunk
like
its
undistorted
neighbours
much
wondering
at
so
strange
a
deformity
mrs
abbott
seated
herself
on
the
level
portion
and
harvey
as
he
stood
before
her
told
a
fancy
that
had
come
to
him
when
for
the
first
time
he
chanced
to
climb
this
way
might
not
the
tree
represent
some
human
life
a
weak
dubious
all
but
hopeless
beginning
a
check
a
return
upon
itself
a
laboured
circling
last
a
healthful
maturity
upright
triumphing
he
spoke
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
raising
them
at
the
end
he
was
astonished
to
see
that
his
companion
had
flushed
deeply
and
only
then
it
occurred
to
him
that
this
parable
might
be
applied
by
the
hearer
to
herself
make
a
confession
he
added
at
once
forcibly
reminded
me
of
my
own
life
except
that
i
ca
pretend
to
be
triumphing
his
laugh
did
not
cover
the
embarrassment
with
which
he
discovered
that
if
anything
he
had
made
matters
worse
here
was
an
instance
of
his
incorrigible
want
of
tact
much
better
to
have
offered
no
application
of
the
fable
at
all
and
to
have
turned
the
talk
he
had
told
a
simple
truth
but
with
the
result
of
appearing
to
glorify
himself
and
possibly
at
his
friend
expense
vexed
beyond
measure
he
crushed
his
heel
into
the
soft
ground
is
a
very
striking
thought
said
mary
abbott
her
look
still
downcast
shall
never
forget
it
and
she
rose
to
move
onward
they
climbed
in
silence
the
flank
of
the
mountain
growing
steeper
should
have
brought
you
my
old
alpenstock
jested
harvey
slowly
we
have
plenty
of
time
like
to
exert
myself
i
feel
so
well
and
it
does
me
good
he
ventured
to
look
at
her
again
all
her
confusion
had
passed
away
she
had
the
light
of
enjoyment
in
her
eyes
and
returned
his
look
with
a
frankness
hitherto
lacking
must
stay
a
second
week
alma
wo
let
you
go
i
must
the
two
children
ca
be
left
longer
at
langland
it
would
be
presuming
upon
her
kindness
want
to
talk
about
them
but
one
has
much
breath
here
when
we
get
to
the
top
last
of
all
came
a
slippery
scramble
on
broken
stones
to
where
a
shapeless
cairn
rose
above
bare
to
the
dazzling
sky
as
they
issued
from
the
shelter
of
the
wood
a
breeze
buffeted
about
them
but
only
for
a
moment
then
the
air
grew
still
and
nothing
was
audible
but
a
soft
whispering
among
the
boughs
below
the
larches
circling
this
stony
height
could
not
grow
to
their
full
stature
beaten
riven
stunted
by
fierce
blasts
from
mountain
or
from
wave
their
trunks
were
laden
and
their
branches
thickly
matted
with
lichen
so
long
and
hoary
that
it
gave
them
an
aspect
of
age
incalculable
harvey
always
looked
upon
them
with
reverence
if
not
with
awe
in
the
sunny
stillness
their
eyes
wandered
far
and
wide
around
a
vast
horizon
on
two
sides
lay
the
sea
to
the
west
bounded
only
where
it
met
the
blue
sky
above
though
yonder
line
of
cloud
might
perchance
be
the
hills
of
wicklow
eastward
enfolded
by
the
shores
of
a
great
bay
with
mountains
on
the
far
side
faintly
visible
through
silvery
vapour
northward
rose
a
noble
peak
dark
stern
beautiful
in
the
swift
fall
of
curving
rampart
to
the
waves
that
broke
at
its
foot
loftier
by
the
proximity
of
two
summits
like
itself
but
unable
to
vie
with
it
alone
among
the
nearer
mountains
this
crest
was
veiled
smitten
by
it
caught
and
held
them
and
churned
them
into
sunny
cloudlets
which
floated
away
in
long
fleecy
rank
far
athwart
the
clear
depths
of
sky
farther
inland
where
the
haze
of
the
warm
morning
hung
and
wavered
loomed
at
moments
some
grander
form
to
be
imagined
rather
than
descried
a
glimpse
of
heights
which
as
the
day
wore
on
would
slowly
reveal
themselves
and
bask
in
the
broad
glow
under
crowning
snowdon
have
time
we
can
stay
here
said
abbott
moved
with
a
profound
delight
have
an
hour
at
least
the
sun
is
too
hot
you
must
sit
on
the
shadowed
side
of
the
cairn
the
great
silence
had
nothing
of
that
awesomeness
which
broods
in
the
mountain
calm
of
wilder
solitudes
upon
their
ear
fell
the
long
low
hushing
of
the
wood
broken
suddenly
from
time
to
time
by
a
fitful
wind
which
flapped
with
hollow
note
around
the
great
heap
of
stones
whirled
as
if
in
sport
and
was
gone
below
in
leafy
hollows
sounded
the
cry
of
a
jay
the
laugh
of
a
woodpecker
from
far
heath
and
meadow
trembled
the
bleat
of
lambs
nowhere
could
be
discovered
a
human
form
but
man
dwellings
and
the
results
of
his
labour
painted
the
wide
landscape
in
every
direction
on
mountain
sides
and
across
the
undulating
lowland
wall
or
hedge
mapped
his
conquests
of
nature
little
plots
won
by
the
toil
of
successive
generations
for
pasture
or
for
tillage
won
from
the
reluctant
wilderness
which
loves
its
fern
and
gorse
its
mosses
and
heather
near
and
far
were
scattered
the
little
white
cottages
each
a
gleaming
speck
lonely
humble
set
by
the
side
of
some
unfrequented
road
or
high
on
the
green
upland
trackless
save
for
the
feet
of
those
who
dwelt
there
from
talk
of
the
scenery
they
passed
by
no
agreeable
transition
to
the
subject
which
as
yet
they
had
not
found
an
opportunity
of
discussing
it
was
necessary
to
arrive
at
some
new
arrangement
regarding
wager
children
for
the
boy
albert
would
soon
be
nine
years
old
and
as
abbott
confessed
he
had
given
her
a
great
deal
of
trouble
both
the
children
were
intractable
hated
lessons
and
played
alarming
pranks
master
albert
latest
feat
might
have
cost
him
his
life
for
he
struck
furiously
through
a
pane
of
glass
at
a
child
mocking
him
from
the
other
side
and
was
all
but
fainting
from
loss
of
blood
when
abbott
came
to
his
help
plainly
this
youngster
must
be
sent
to
a
minnie
his
sister
would
be
more
easily
managed
after
he
had
gone
grow
up
a
fighter
said
harvey
ca
do
without
fighters
i
make
inquiry
at
once
about
a
school
for
him
and
in
a
year
or
two
we
take
counsel
with
his
teachers
perhaps
he
might
go
into
the
navy
cost
of
it
all
fell
from
his
companion
in
a
nervous
undertone
had
that
out
long
ago
do
think
about
it
course
you
will
send
only
half
the
money
when
albert
leaves
me
said
abbott
earnestly
shall
be
in
no
difficulty
i
have
had
letters
from
several
people
asking
me
to
take
their
little
children
to
live
with
me
albert
place
will
be
filled
at
once
i
ca
take
more
into
the
house
there
no
room
with
them
and
my
kindergarten
and
the
lessons
i
give
in
the
evening
i
can
live
very
well
harvey
mused
wishing
to
feel
himself
in
complete
sympathy
with
his
friend
he
knew
that
something
of
the
old
criticism
still
tempered
his
liking
mary
abbott
had
fine
qualities
but
lacked
the
simplicity
the
directness
which
would
have
made
her
courage
wholly
admirable
he
suspected
that
she
continually
mourned
over
what
seemed
to
her
a
waste
of
life
proud
of
her
remembering
her
distinction
as
a
teacher
of
girls
she
had
undertaken
as
a
penitence
the
care
of
little
children
and
persevered
in
it
with
obstinacy
rather
than
with
inspired
purpose
mary
abbott
doubtless
had
always
regarded
life
as
a
conflict
she
had
always
fought
for
her
own
hand
when
such
a
nature
falls
into
genuine
remorse
asceticism
will
inevitably
follow
with
it
comes
the
danger
of
more
or
less
conscious
embitterment
harvey
had
a
conviction
of
his
friend
sincerity
and
believed
her
in
every
way
a
better
woman
than
in
the
days
before
her
great
sorrow
but
he
could
not
yet
assure
himself
that
she
had
found
her
true
vocation
they
spoke
of
the
people
who
were
so
anxious
to
be
relieved
of
their
children
lady
wrote
to
me
that
she
would
pay
almost
anything
if
i
would
take
her
little
boy
and
keep
him
all
the
year
round
she
has
only
a
small
house
and
the
child
utterly
upsets
her
life
of
course
i
understand
her
i
should
have
sympathised
with
her
once
intelligible
enough
replied
harvey
with
a
laugh
there
will
be
huge
establishments
for
the
young
children
of
people
naturally
children
are
a
nuisance
especially
so
if
you
live
in
a
whirlpool
i
know
it
too
well
the
whirlpool
way
of
life
said
abbott
her
eyes
on
the
far
mountains
know
how
easily
one
is
drawn
into
it
it
is
only
idle
people
course
not
there
the
whirlpool
of
the
furiously
busy
round
and
round
they
go
brains
humming
till
they
melt
or
explode
of
course
they
ca
bother
with
children
loses
all
sense
of
responsibility
they
have
never
had
it
and
it
has
no
chance
of
developing
you
know
it
is
a
matter
of
course
for
people
to
see
that
they
are
under
an
enormous
obligation
to
the
children
they
bring
into
the
world
except
in
a
parent
here
and
there
that
comes
only
with
very
favourable
circumstances
when
there
no
leisure
no
meditation
no
peace
and
quietness
when
instead
of
conversing
people
just
nod
or
shout
to
each
other
as
they
spin
round
and
round
the
gulf
men
and
women
practically
return
to
the
state
of
savages
in
all
that
concerns
their
offspring
the
brats
have
come
into
existence
and
must
make
the
best
of
it
servants
governesses
schoolmasters
anybody
but
the
parents
may
give
thought
to
children
well
it
a
matter
for
the
individual
i
should
feel
comfortable
myself
a
matter
for
the
world
too
said
mary
harvey
nodded
as
he
sat
at
the
foot
of
the
piled
stones
his
hand
touched
a
sprig
of
last
year
heather
the
stem
was
hung
with
dry
rustling
colourless
bells
which
had
clung
there
all
through
the
cold
stormy
months
telling
of
beauty
that
was
past
and
of
beauty
that
was
to
come
he
broke
it
off
and
showed
it
to
his
companion
until
the
time
for
moving
they
talked
of
simpler
things
and
mary
abbott
recovered
her
spirits
chapter
turning
regretfully
from
the
place
of
rest
with
its
lulling
sounds
and
noble
prospects
they
began
to
descend
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
which
was
more
rugged
than
that
by
which
they
had
come
up
harvey
timed
the
walk
so
well
that
they
reached
the
point
of
the
road
where
alma
would
meet
them
at
a
few
minutes
before
the
time
agreed
upon
no
one
was
in
sight
the
road
in
its
inland
direction
could
be
scanned
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
the
other
way
it
curved
rapidly
and
was
soon
hidden
by
hear
nothing
said
rolfe
when
they
had
stood
silent
for
a
little
mistake
is
impossible
the
man
has
driven
to
meet
us
here
before
shall
we
walk
on
they
proceeded
slowly
stopping
from
time
to
time
harvey
was
puzzled
by
this
unpunctuality
it
would
soon
be
a
quarter
to
two
he
began
to
feel
hungry
and
his
companion
looked
tired
of
a
sudden
they
heard
the
sound
of
a
vehicle
approaching
behind
them
ca
be
alma
she
would
have
gone
farther
than
but
the
horse
appeared
round
the
curve
of
the
road
and
behind
it
was
a
dogcart
and
in
the
dogcart
sat
alma
alone
at
sight
of
them
she
pulled
up
abruptly
so
abruptly
that
the
horse
reared
a
little
harvey
walked
forward
been
driving
yourself
course
why
not
replied
alma
in
a
strangely
high
key
have
we
missed
you
as
he
put
this
question
he
became
aware
of
something
very
unusual
in
his
wife
appearance
alma
was
pallid
and
shaking
her
small
felt
hat
had
got
out
of
position
and
her
hair
was
disordered
giving
her
a
wild
rakish
aspect
he
saw
too
that
the
horse
dripped
with
sweat
that
it
glared
panted
trembled
and
could
not
for
a
moment
stand
still
on
earth
have
you
been
doing
she
run
away
with
you
no
cried
alma
laughing
as
she
looked
at
abbott
who
had
just
come
up
was
rather
fresh
and
i
gave
her
a
good
run
all
i
sorry
i
missed
you
at
the
place
did
williams
drive
asked
harvey
in
a
voice
turning
to
anger
why
should
williams
drive
alma
returned
her
eyes
flashing
only
a
few
minutes
late
i
do
see
anything
to
make
a
fuss
about
this
temper
was
as
strange
in
alma
as
the
personal
appearance
she
presented
harvey
said
no
more
but
after
quickly
examining
the
horse
helped
abbott
to
a
seat
at
the
back
of
the
vehicle
he
then
jumped
up
to
his
wife
side
and
without
a
word
took
the
reins
from
her
hand
alma
made
no
remark
as
she
surrendered
them
your
hat
straight
he
said
to
her
in
a
low
voice
hat
what
the
matter
with
it
the
wind
i
suppose
did
you
enjoy
it
mrs
abbott
she
turned
in
speaking
so
as
to
have
her
back
towards
harvey
and
kept
this
position
all
the
way
talking
with
her
guest
as
if
nothing
had
happened
rolfe
his
face
grimly
set
uttered
only
a
word
or
two
he
had
to
drive
very
slowly
and
with
all
caution
for
the
animal
shied
every
other
minute
and
he
felt
heartily
glad
when
they
all
alighted
williams
who
ran
out
from
the
stable
stood
in
astonishment
at
sight
of
the
horse
condition
fresh
this
morning
said
harvey
as
the
ladies
went
in
rolfe
had
a
little
trouble
with
her
this
mild
explanation
by
no
means
satisfied
the
coachman
though
he
pretended
to
acquiesce
seeing
him
give
a
look
at
the
horse
knees
harvey
did
the
same
nothing
was
wrong
there
williams
pointed
to
marks
on
one
of
the
wheels
the
cart
had
evidently
grazed
against
a
wall
alma
must
have
lost
control
of
the
horse
and
have
been
carried
a
considerable
distance
before
somehow
it
was
stopped
without
doubt
she
had
had
a
very
narrow
escape
her
anger
seemed
to
be
the
result
of
nerves
upset
and
mortified
vanity
she
wished
to
show
abbott
that
she
could
drive
the
explanation
of
the
whole
matter
harvey
was
vexed
at
such
a
piece
of
childishness
irritated
too
by
the
outbreak
of
temper
with
which
alma
had
replied
to
his
very
natural
alarm
of
course
he
would
say
nothing
more
it
would
be
interesting
to
await
the
outcome
of
his
wife
mature
reflection
on
her
folly
as
he
stepped
into
the
house
something
like
a
cry
for
help
sounded
from
above
stairs
he
shouted
that
and
in
the
same
moment
mary
abbott
called
to
him
that
rolfe
had
fainted
on
rushing
up
he
found
mary
with
difficulty
supporting
alma
unconscious
form
saw
she
could
hardly
get
upstairs
said
abbott
here
on
the
landing
she
gave
a
moan
and
fell
back
i
was
luckily
close
by
her
they
carried
her
into
her
room
and
gave
what
help
they
could
whilst
the
doctor
was
being
summoned
in
a
few
minutes
alma
regained
consciousness
and
declared
herself
quite
well
again
but
when
she
tried
to
rise
strength
failed
her
she
began
to
moan
in
physical
distress
harvey
went
downstairs
whilst
abbott
and
ruth
tended
the
sufferer
their
ordinary
medical
man
was
far
away
among
the
hills
his
assistant
had
to
be
searched
for
and
came
only
after
the
lapse
of
two
hours
by
which
time
rolfe
had
worked
himself
into
a
fever
whilst
abbott
faint
with
agitation
and
weariness
took
a
hurried
meal
he
went
to
the
bedside
and
tried
to
learn
whether
alma
was
suffering
merely
from
shock
or
had
sustained
an
actual
injury
but
she
still
nursed
her
grievance
against
him
and
would
say
very
little
why
did
not
the
doctor
come
she
wished
to
see
the
doctor
no
one
else
was
of
any
use
down
and
have
lunch
with
abbott
properly
do
go
please
i
hate
all
this
fuss
and
it
quite
unnecessary
let
me
be
alone
till
the
doctor
comes
before
the
arrival
of
dr
evans
assistant
she
again
fainted
and
upon
that
followed
an
attack
of
hysteria
when
at
length
the
medical
man
had
seen
her
harvey
received
an
adequate
but
far
from
reassuring
explanation
of
the
state
of
things
at
nightfall
dr
evans
came
in
person
and
was
with
the
patient
for
a
long
time
he
spoke
less
gravely
of
the
case
offered
a
lucid
diagnosis
and
thought
that
the
services
of
an
ordinary
nurse
for
a
few
days
would
meet
every
necessity
williams
was
sent
with
a
hired
vehicle
to
the
market
town
seven
miles
away
and
late
at
night
returned
with
the
woman
recommended
alma
meanwhile
had
lain
quietly
and
the
household
at
length
went
to
rest
without
renewal
of
alarms
twice
before
dawn
harvey
left
his
room
and
stepped
silently
to
door
the
first
time
he
heard
low
voices
the
second
there
was
no
sound
when
about
eight
he
went
down
and
out
into
the
garden
he
was
surprised
to
meet
abbott
she
had
already
seen
the
nurse
this
morning
and
reported
that
all
was
going
well
rolfe
talked
cheerfully
again
and
would
not
listen
to
his
guest
timid
suggestion
that
she
should
take
leave
today
not
a
bit
of
it
she
was
to
go
down
to
the
seashore
and
enjoy
the
sunshine
and
worry
herself
just
as
little
as
possible
at
came
a
message
from
alma
to
the
same
effect
abbott
was
on
no
account
to
cut
short
her
visit
and
harvey
was
to
do
his
duty
as
host
she
herself
said
rolfe
would
be
as
well
as
ever
in
a
day
or
two
for
all
that
when
the
appointed
day
for
the
guest
departure
came
alma
still
lay
blanched
and
feeble
not
likely
to
leave
her
bed
for
another
week
she
was
however
in
a
remarkably
cheerful
frame
of
mind
having
to
start
on
her
journey
as
early
as
eight
abbott
bade
to
her
hostess
the
evening
before
and
nothing
could
have
been
kinder
or
more
amiable
than
alma
behaviour
bear
a
grudge
against
me
for
spoiling
your
holiday
she
said
holding
her
guest
hand
and
smiling
brightly
i
say
all
is
for
the
best
perhaps
you
understand
me
and
perhaps
you
wo
it
sounds
pious
at
all
events
does
it
we
must
see
each
other
again
you
know
here
or
somewhere
else
i
quite
sure
we
can
be
friends
of
course
harvey
will
go
with
you
in
the
morning
abbott
begged
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
but
alma
was
imperative
course
he
will
if
it
rains
a
covered
carriage
will
be
here
in
time
and
write
to
me
mind
you
write
to
me
not
only
to
say
you
got
safe
home
but
in
future
you
promise
in
the
morning
it
did
rain
and
heavily
so
harvey
and
his
friend
drove
to
the
station
shut
up
together
with
scarce
a
glimpse
of
anything
beyond
the
boulder
walls
and
gorse
hedges
and
dripping
they
spoke
a
good
deal
of
alma
as
soon
as
she
was
well
again
said
rolfe
he
must
take
her
for
a
thorough
change
in
truth
he
was
beginning
he
said
to
doubt
whether
she
could
live
in
this
place
much
longer
she
liked
it
oh
yes
she
liked
it
but
he
feared
the
solitude
was
telling
upon
her
nerves
abbott
admitted
that
there
might
be
something
in
this
you
return
to
london
she
asked
whereupon
harvey
stared
before
him
and
looked
troubled
and
could
only
answer
that
he
did
not
know
when
two
days
after
the
promised
letter
came
from
abbott
harvey
took
it
up
to
the
invalid
room
and
sat
by
her
whilst
she
read
it
writes
so
nicely
said
alma
who
never
in
her
life
had
showed
such
sweetness
of
disposition
as
during
this
convalescence
it
for
yourself
harvey
is
it
a
nice
letter
i
feel
so
sorry
we
have
known
each
other
before
but
we
going
to
be
friends
now
sure
i
very
glad
from
mamma
i
almost
think
i
could
write
to
her
of
course
she
fall
into
a
dreadful
state
of
mind
and
want
to
know
why
she
was
sent
for
and
lament
over
everything
but
it
no
use
her
coming
here
now
when
we
go
away
we
must
manage
to
see
her
have
you
thought
where
you
would
like
to
go
yet
there
plenty
of
time
not
a
word
had
passed
between
them
with
reference
to
the
perilous
drive
alma
spoke
as
if
her
illness
were
merely
natural
due
to
nothing
in
particular
but
her
husband
fancied
that
she
wished
to
atone
by
sweet
and
affectionate
behaviour
for
that
unwonted
of
him
he
saw
too
beyond
doubt
that
the
illness
seemed
to
her
a
blessing
its
result
which
some
women
would
have
wept
over
brought
joy
into
her
eyes
this
in
so
far
as
it
was
unnatural
caused
him
some
disturbance
on
the
other
hand
he
was
quite
unable
to
take
a
regretful
view
of
what
had
happened
and
why
should
he
charge
upon
alma
as
a
moral
fault
that
which
he
easily
condoned
in
himself
a
few
days
more
and
the
convalescent
was
allowed
to
leave
her
room
as
if
to
welcome
her
there
arrived
that
morning
a
letter
from
melbourne
with
news
that
sibyl
and
her
husband
would
sail
for
england
in
a
fortnight
time
after
the
date
of
writing
by
the
orient
line
steamer
know
what
you
suggested
cried
alma
delightedly
we
go
to
naples
we
should
have
to
be
off
immediately
if
they
come
by
the
next
ship
after
the
one
that
brought
this
letter
they
are
now
only
a
fortnight
from
the
end
of
the
voyage
that
means
allowing
for
their
nine
days
from
naples
to
london
that
we
should
have
to
be
at
naples
in
four
or
five
days
from
now
that
easily
managed
is
it
by
anyone
in
your
state
of
health
replied
harvey
gently
am
perfectly
well
i
could
travel
night
and
day
why
not
one
eats
and
sleeps
as
usual
besides
are
you
quite
sure
they
may
be
longer
than
you
think
telegraph
to
the
london
office
and
ask
when
the
will
reach
naples
you
like
but
for
one
thing
it
quite
certain
you
ought
to
travel
in
less
than
a
week
and
then
what
about
hughie
alma
face
darkened
with
vexation
does
matter
she
said
coldly
had
counted
on
it
but
of
course
that
nothing
there
the
baby
to
be
considered
first
harvey
had
never
been
so
near
the
point
of
answering
his
wife
in
rough
masculine
fashion
this
illness
of
hers
had
unsettled
his
happy
frame
of
mind
perturbing
him
with
anxious
thoughts
and
making
confusion
of
the
quiet
reasonable
prospect
that
lay
before
him
only
a
week
or
two
ago
he
too
could
much
have
enjoyed
the
run
to
naples
and
the
voyage
back
and
disappointment
taxed
his
patience
irritated
against
alma
and
ashamed
of
himself
for
not
being
better
tempered
he
turned
and
left
the
room
a
few
minutes
afterwards
he
walked
to
the
where
he
addressed
a
telegram
of
inquiry
to
the
orient
line
people
in
london
it
was
useless
of
course
but
he
might
as
well
satisfy
alma
the
reply
telegram
was
delivered
to
him
as
he
sauntered
about
in
the
garden
it
merely
confirmed
his
calculation
there
might
possibly
be
a
clear
five
days
before
the
touched
at
naples
most
likely
not
more
than
four
he
went
into
the
but
alma
was
not
there
he
looked
into
the
study
and
found
it
vacant
as
ruth
happened
to
pass
he
bade
her
take
the
telegram
to
rolfe
upstairs
he
had
no
mind
for
reading
or
for
any
other
occupation
he
shut
his
door
and
began
to
smoke
in
the
whiffs
curling
from
his
pipe
he
imagined
the
smoke
of
the
great
steamer
as
she
drove
northward
from
indian
seas
he
heard
the
throb
of
the
engines
saw
the
white
wake
naples
the
mediterranean
gibraltar
frowning
towards
the
purple
mountains
of
morocco
the
tumbling
bay
the
green
shores
of
devon
his
pulses
throbbed
as
he
went
voyaging
in
memory
and
he
might
start
this
very
hour
but
for
the
child
who
could
not
be
left
alone
to
servants
with
something
like
a
laugh
he
thought
of
the
people
who
implored
mary
abbott
to
relieve
them
of
their
burdensome
youngsters
and
at
that
moment
alma
opened
the
door
her
face
thinned
a
little
by
illness
had
quite
recovered
its
amiable
humour
course
you
are
quite
right
harvey
we
ca
rush
across
europe
at
a
moment
notice
he
rose
up
the
lover
light
in
his
eyes
again
and
drew
her
to
him
and
held
her
in
a
laughing
embrace
has
been
wrong
between
us
it
a
new
thing
for
you
and
me
to
be
scowling
and
snarling
hope
i
neither
scowled
nor
snarled
dear
boy
though
i
not
sure
that
did
no
doubt
abbott
went
away
thinking
we
lead
rather
a
cat
and
dog
life
it
no
how
could
she
have
any
such
thoughts
the
drive
home
that
day
whose
fault
was
that
i
should
have
been
all
right
except
that
i
could
understand
why
you
had
run
the
chance
of
killing
yourself
do
think
i
should
have
cared
very
much
that
morning
said
alma
idly
was
more
miserable
than
you
can
imagine
i
do
know
foolishness
but
you
never
gave
me
a
word
of
praise
and
i
sure
i
deserved
it
why
she
galloped
with
me
like
mad
for
nearly
two
miles
and
i
never
lost
hold
of
the
reins
and
i
pulled
her
up
by
myself
and
got
her
round
and
drove
back
to
meet
you
as
if
nothing
had
happened
i
told
abbott
all
about
it
and
she
was
astonished
at
my
pluck
have
been
so
am
i
doubt
it
i
doubt
whether
you
ever
think
much
of
anything
i
do
rather
unkind
because
you
know
it
is
true
always
thought
very
much
the
same
you
know
but
come
what
are
we
going
to
do
naples
seems
out
of
the
question
but
there
no
reason
why
we
should
go
to
meet
them
in
london
would
much
rather
wait
here
and
let
them
come
said
alma
do
care
particularly
about
going
away
so
long
as
we
keep
on
good
terms
with
each
other
that
the
chief
thing
has
never
been
a
dream
of
anything
else
we
are
on
good
terms
as
a
matter
of
course
it
part
of
the
order
of
the
universe
very
sorry
dear
that
i
threatened
the
universe
with
catastrophe
but
i
wo
do
it
again
indeed
i
wo
i
will
watch
your
face
and
be
on
my
guard
and
really
you
know
under
ordinary
circumstances
i
am
enough
all
this
about
cried
harvey
for
she
seemed
to
be
in
earnest
and
spoke
with
a
soft
humility
such
as
might
have
become
the
least
original
of
wives
my
face
and
be
on
your
guard
since
when
have
i
desired
you
to
be
a
simpleton
quite
serious
it
is
foolish
at
all
i
want
to
please
you
that
all
i
mean
dear
he
gazed
at
her
wondering
inclined
to
laugh
yet
withheld
from
it
by
an
uneasy
feeling
kind
of
talk
means
defective
circulation
lost
appetite
and
so
on
was
his
answer
way
to
please
me
is
to
get
some
colour
into
your
cheeks
again
and
snub
me
for
my
ignorance
of
music
and
be
your
own
arrogant
self
but
listen
you
quite
mistaken
in
thinking
i
want
to
stay
here
till
hugh
and
his
wife
come
it
wo
do
you
getting
far
too
sweet
and
docile
and
everything
detestable
i
had
no
idea
of
marrying
an
angel
it
too
bad
if
you
turn
seraphic
upon
my
hands
i
wonder
now
whether
by
way
of
pleasing
me
you
would
answer
a
plain
question
try
you
been
wanting
to
get
away
from
this
place
i
mean
to
live
somewhere
else
what
can
have
made
you
think
so
is
trying
to
answer
a
question
you
know
alma
after
looking
keenly
at
him
had
turned
her
face
to
the
window
she
kept
silence
and
wore
a
look
of
calm
reflectiveness
you
been
bored
and
wearied
by
this
life
harvey
asked
in
his
most
tone
do
think
i
have
ever
for
a
moment
shown
a
sign
of
it
replied
alma
with
grave
conviction
much
the
worse
if
it
meant
that
you
concealed
your
thoughts
shall
always
be
content
harvey
so
long
as
i
see
you
are
living
the
kind
of
life
that
suits
you
he
uttered
a
shout
of
humorous
yet
exasperation
you
want
me
to
swear
it
a
long
time
since
i
lost
the
habit
but
it
might
strike
you
as
manly
and
perhaps
i
had
better
practise
again
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
kind
of
life
that
suits
you
remember
my
talking
about
that
before
we
were
married
i
had
a
suspicion
that
you
were
getting
rather
into
that
state
of
mind
you
dropped
your
music
and
partly
i
no
doubt
because
you
did
find
enough
intelligent
sympathy
in
me
you
went
in
for
painting
and
dropped
that
was
winter
you
see
alma
interrupted
but
that
was
the
only
reason
it
meant
general
failure
of
energy
the
kind
of
thing
i
known
myself
only
too
well
here
asked
alma
with
some
alacrity
meant
now
and
again
all
through
my
life
no
here
i
gone
on
right
enough
with
a
tolerably
even
mind
and
for
that
very
reason
i
have
noticed
any
signs
of
the
other
thing
in
you
till
just
now
when
you
lost
your
head
why
have
you
been
frank
with
me
take
it
for
granted
that
i
had
anything
to
be
frank
about
alma
remarked
and
you
do
contradict
me
what
were
you
going
to
say
harvey
she
bent
towards
him
with
that
air
of
sweet
reasonableness
which
showed
her
features
at
their
best
eye
tranquil
and
intelligent
lips
ingenuously
smiling
a
countenance
she
wore
not
thrice
in
a
twelvemonth
but
by
harvey
well
remembered
amid
all
changes
and
held
to
express
the
true
being
of
the
woman
he
loved
i
was
going
to
say
dear
he
replied
tenderly
no
good
can
come
of
sacrificing
your
instincts
you
have
not
to
ask
yourself
whether
i
am
lazily
comfortable
for
that
what
it
amounts
to
but
what
you
are
making
of
your
life
remember
for
one
thing
that
i
am
considerably
older
she
checked
him
with
an
extended
hand
do
want
to
remember
anything
of
the
kind
no
harm
in
it
i
hope
he
laughed
a
little
difference
is
distressing
but
just
enough
to
be
taken
into
account
at
forty
or
near
it
a
man
who
is
happily
married
gets
used
to
his
slippers
and
his
pipe
especially
if
comfort
and
all
the
rest
of
it
have
come
after
half
a
lifetime
of
homelessness
i
might
often
say
to
myself
that
i
was
wasting
time
rusting
and
so
on
but
the
next
day
i
should
fall
back
into
the
again
and
hate
the
thought
of
changes
but
you
with
thirty
still
far
ahead
slippers
and
pipe
have
no
particular
attraction
for
you
he
saw
a
thought
in
her
eyes
and
paused
will
soon
be
able
to
talk
fell
from
alma
her
look
no
longer
that
of
ingenuous
sweetness
but
of
virtue
just
a
trifle
and
her
husband
though
he
read
this
meaning
in
the
change
was
yet
pleased
by
the
words
that
accompanied
it
and
then
there
will
be
more
for
you
to
do
you
were
going
to
say
but
that
wo
occupy
you
entirely
and
it
does
bind
you
to
any
particular
spot
not
she
had
become
almost
demure
harvey
took
his
eyes
away
comes
to
this
you
not
to
subordinate
your
life
to
mine
the
old
idea
and
it
still
works
well
with
some
people
yet
i
know
perhaps
it
does
really
one
knows
little
enough
about
people
lives
at
all
events
it
wo
work
in
our
case
and
remember
that
we
never
thought
it
would
we
talked
it
all
over
with
no
humbug
on
either
side
rather
an
unusual
sort
of
talk
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
i
liked
you
for
the
you
showed
and
i
remember
patting
myself
on
the
back
for
a
rational
bit
of
behaviour
at
a
time
when
i
felt
rather
crazy
alma
laughed
in
her
gayest
key
were
delicious
i
did
quite
know
what
to
make
of
you
and
perhaps
that
was
the
very
reason
for
what
asked
harvey
when
she
broke
off
and
looked
not
quite
so
pale
as
a
moment
before
forget
what
i
was
going
to
say
but
please
go
on
it
very
interesting
as
your
talk
always
is
said
about
all
you
not
to
be
dutiful
and
commonplace
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
do
think
you
can
accuse
me
of
ever
being
commonplace
not
said
harvey
as
for
dutiful
our
duty
is
to
be
consistent
do
you
think
if
by
consistency
you
mean
the
steady
resolve
to
make
the
most
of
yourself
that
what
you
had
in
mind
when
you
came
here
as
soon
as
you
begin
to
grow
limp
it
time
to
ask
what
is
the
matter
i
offer
any
advice
you
know
yourself
better
than
i
can
know
you
for
you
to
tell
me
what
goes
on
in
your
mind
what
the
use
of
our
living
together
if
you
keep
your
most
serious
thoughts
to
yourself
harvey
rolfe
glowed
with
a
sense
of
his
own
generous
wisdom
he
had
never
felt
so
keen
a
indeed
that
emotion
seldom
came
to
solace
him
for
the
most
part
he
was
the
severest
critic
of
his
own
doings
and
sayings
but
for
once
it
appeared
to
him
that
he
uttered
golden
words
the
ripe
fruit
of
experience
and
reflection
that
personal
unrest
had
anything
to
do
with
the
counsel
he
offered
to
his
wife
he
did
not
for
the
moment
even
suspect
alma
had
touched
him
with
her
unfamiliar
note
of
simple
womanhood
and
all
at
once
there
was
revealed
to
him
a
peril
of
selfishness
from
which
he
strongly
recoiled
he
seemed
to
be
much
older
and
alma
much
more
youthful
than
he
was
wont
to
perceive
very
gently
and
sweetly
she
had
put
him
in
mind
of
this
fact
it
behoved
him
to
consider
it
well
and
act
upon
the
outcome
of
such
reflection
heavens
was
he
in
danger
of
becoming
the
typical
husband
the
man
who
as
he
had
put
it
thinks
first
of
his
pipe
and
slippers
from
the
outside
no
man
would
more
quickly
or
more
contemptuously
have
noted
the
moral
of
this
present
situation
being
immediately
concerned
he
could
see
nothing
in
his
attitude
but
a
wise
and
noble
disinterestedness
and
thus
at
a
moment
when
he
wittingly
held
the
future
in
his
hands
he
prided
himself
on
leaving
to
alma
an
entire
responsibility
making
her
in
the
ordinary
phrase
mistress
of
her
own
fate
and
waiting
upon
her
decisions
will
think
a
little
longer
said
alma
sighing
contentedly
then
we
talk
about
it
again
it
quite
true
i
was
getting
a
little
run
down
and
perhaps
but
we
talk
about
it
in
a
day
or
two
we
decide
anything
for
the
present
would
you
care
to
go
and
meet
the
steamer
at
plymouth
take
hughie
suppose
i
wrote
very
nicely
to
mamma
and
asked
if
we
might
leave
hughie
with
her
in
hampshire
for
a
few
days
i
dare
say
she
would
be
delighted
and
the
other
people
too
the
nurse
could
be
with
him
i
dare
say
we
could
call
there
on
our
way
and
ruth
would
look
after
the
house
very
well
and
ask
you
and
i
alma
began
to
talk
joyously
ramble
about
devonshire
till
the
ship
comes
let
me
see
if
we
travelled
on
monday
that
would
give
us
several
days
would
it
and
the
carnabys
might
either
land
at
plymouth
or
we
go
on
with
them
in
the
ship
to
london
that
a
very
good
plan
but
why
lose
time
by
writing
send
a
telegram
to
mamma
could
we
leave
hughie
and
nurse
with
you
for
a
day
or
two
harvey
again
turned
his
steps
to
the
and
this
message
was
despatched
a
few
hours
elapsed
before
the
reply
came
but
it
was
favourable
we
leave
on
monday
exclaimed
alma
whose
convalescence
was
visibly
proceeding
send
another
telegram
a
word
or
two
that
they
may
be
ready
as
well
have
mentioned
the
day
in
the
other
said
harvey
though
glad
to
have
something
more
to
do
course
how
thoughtless
and
they
laughed
and
were
in
the
best
of
tempers
on
the
morrow
sunday
they
walked
together
as
they
had
used
to
do
in
the
first
spring
after
their
marriage
along
the
grassy
cliffs
then
down
to
the
nook
where
the
sand
is
full
of
tiny
shells
and
round
the
little
headland
into
the
next
bay
where
the
quaint
old
stands
upon
the
edge
of
the
tide
and
alma
was
again
in
love
and
held
her
husband
hand
and
said
the
sweetest
things
in
the
most
wonderful
voice
she
herself
a
little
so
that
when
they
ascended
the
cliff
again
harvey
had
to
support
her
and
in
the
sunny
solitude
she
thanked
him
with
her
lips
in
two
ways
it
was
a
second
honeymoon
chapter
frothingham
sister
who
lived
near
basingstoke
gave
a
warm
welcome
to
little
hugh
rolfe
and
frothingham
who
had
all
but
forgotten
that
the
child
was
not
really
her
grandson
took
charge
of
him
with
pride
and
joy
he
stayed
a
week
he
stayed
a
fortnight
he
stayed
two
months
for
when
the
carnabys
who
landed
at
plymouth
and
rested
there
for
a
couple
of
days
made
known
their
intention
of
straightway
taking
a
flat
in
town
it
seemed
to
alma
that
the
very
best
thing
for
her
health
would
be
to
spend
a
week
or
two
in
london
and
see
her
old
friends
and
go
to
a
few
concerts
the
time
was
favourable
for
june
had
only
just
set
in
harvey
nothing
loath
took
his
wife
to
a
quiet
hotel
in
the
portman
square
region
whither
also
went
their
friends
from
abroad
his
project
being
to
look
for
furnished
rooms
where
child
and
nurse
could
join
them
but
frothingham
thought
it
a
pity
of
pities
to
take
little
hugh
into
the
town
when
all
was
so
pleasantly
arranged
for
him
down
in
hampshire
and
as
alma
evidently
inclined
to
the
same
view
the
uninviting
thought
of
was
laid
aside
they
might
as
well
remain
at
the
hotel
said
harvey
alma
with
a
pretty
show
of
economical
hesitation
approved
the
plan
saying
that
she
would
be
quite
ready
to
go
home
again
when
sibyl
had
established
herself
in
a
flat
this
event
came
to
pass
in
about
three
weeks
the
carnabys
found
a
flat
which
suited
them
very
well
at
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
and
thither
with
the
least
possible
delay
transferred
a
portion
of
their
furniture
which
had
lain
in
warehouse
thereupon
sweetly
reasonable
rolfe
made
known
that
it
was
time
to
fetch
her
baby
and
return
to
carnarvonshire
she
felt
incalculably
better
the
change
had
been
most
refreshing
now
for
renewed
enjoyment
of
her
dear
home
but
harvey
wore
his
wisest
countenance
no
owl
could
have
surpassed
it
for
sage
gravity
are
very
much
better
and
do
you
think
you
would
be
better
still
after
another
week
or
two
the
concerts
are
in
full
swing
it
seems
a
pity
now
you
are
here
alma
looked
gracefully
reluctant
were
not
the
hotel
expenses
rather
heavy
you
must
remember
that
at
home
we
live
on
half
our
income
or
less
if
that
all
that
troubles
you
are
very
kind
harvey
as
for
that
i
enjoying
myself
and
i
like
to
see
you
in
such
capital
spirits
so
with
a
happy
sigh
alma
gave
up
the
packing
of
her
trunk
and
wrote
to
frothingham
that
if
baby
was
not
a
trouble
they
might
stay
for
another
fortnight
is
in
such
capital
spirits
and
does
so
enjoy
himself
that
i
do
think
he
ought
to
go
home
whilst
all
the
life
of
the
season
is
in
full
swing
of
course
i
could
leave
him
here
but
if
you
will
credit
it
he
seems
really
to
wish
to
have
me
with
him
if
i
tried
to
say
how
thoroughly
good
and
kind
he
is
i
should
make
you
laugh
it
amuses
me
to
see
him
turned
into
a
sort
of
bachelor
again
this
is
no
contradiction
i
mean
that
here
among
his
men
friends
he
shows
a
new
side
of
himself
seems
younger
to
tell
the
truth
and
has
a
kind
of
gaiety
quite
different
from
his
good
humour
at
home
you
ca
think
how
he
enjoys
a
dinner
at
the
club
for
instance
quite
in
a
boyish
way
and
then
he
comes
back
with
all
sorts
of
stories
and
bits
of
character
and
i
do
know
what
we
forget
the
time
and
sit
talking
till
i
dare
tell
you
when
but
i
am
doing
the
same
thing
now
for
it
is
twelve
noon
and
i
have
promised
to
lunch
with
sibyl
at
one
her
flat
is
just
finished
and
looks
very
pretty
indeed
a
thousand
kisses
to
my
little
darling
try
and
make
him
understand
that
has
not
gone
for
ever
she
dressed
with
care
her
wardrobe
had
undergone
a
complete
renewal
and
drove
off
in
a
hansom
to
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
it
was
to
be
a
luncheon
of
intimacy
for
sibyl
had
not
yet
gathered
her
acquaintances
when
alma
entered
carnaby
was
sitting
just
as
in
the
days
before
her
great
migration
perfectly
at
ease
admirably
her
beauty
arrayed
with
all
the
chastity
of
effect
which
distinguished
her
among
idle
and
women
she
had
found
a
new
way
of
doing
her
hair
a
manner
so
young
so
virginal
that
alma
could
not
but
gaze
with
wonder
and
admiration
do
look
sweet
today
i
i
glad
you
think
i
want
your
opinion
would
you
have
the
piano
there
or
this
matter
was
discussed
and
then
they
obeyed
the
tuneful
gong
that
summoned
them
to
the
alma
surveyed
everything
and
felt
a
secret
envy
here
was
no
demonstration
of
the
simple
life
things
beautiful
and
luxurious
filled
all
available
space
and
indeed
it
for
sibyl
had
tried
to
use
as
much
as
possible
of
the
furniture
formerly
displayed
in
hamilton
terrace
with
such
alterations
and
novelties
as
were
imposed
by
the
fashion
of
today
she
offered
her
guest
a
most
dainty
little
meal
a
luncheon
such
as
alma
could
not
possibly
have
devised
in
spite
of
all
her
reminiscences
is
a
great
thing
sibyl
remarked
good
to
have
been
in
savagery
just
to
appreciate
one
privileges
you
liked
honolulu
yes
i
was
thinking
of
queensland
there
no
barbarism
at
honolulu
if
you
keep
out
of
sight
of
the
americans
and
europeans
yes
i
enjoyed
myself
there
i
think
i
could
go
back
and
live
out
my
life
at
waikiki
astonished
me
that
you
did
make
an
effort
to
go
with
hugh
to
that
great
volcano
i
have
read
about
it
since
and
i
sure
i
should
have
faced
anything
murmured
sibyl
with
a
dreamy
air
as
she
raised
the
to
her
lips
was
lazy
no
doubt
the
climate
you
know
and
then
i
do
care
much
about
bubbling
lava
it
was
much
nicer
to
watch
the
at
where
is
your
husband
today
all
things
in
the
world
gone
to
lord
he
says
he
never
saw
a
cricket
match
in
his
life
and
it
struck
him
this
morning
that
it
really
was
a
defect
in
his
education
of
course
he
was
thinking
of
hughie
he
wants
hughie
to
be
a
cricketer
and
horseman
and
everything
that
robust
like
hugh
replied
sibyl
laughing
should
feel
the
same
if
i
had
a
boy
i
like
men
though
i
should
care
always
to
live
among
them
at
coventry
still
alma
inquired
her
hostess
gave
a
nod
with
a
look
intimating
that
she
would
say
more
when
the
servant
left
them
free
to
talk
she
added
you
know
mrs
strangeways
seem
to
remember
a
strangeways
replied
alma
i
think
how
or
where
he
a
man
who
goes
about
a
good
deal
his
wife
was
the
widow
of
that
artist
who
promised
so
well
and
got
into
a
scrape
and
died
miserably
edward
no
egbert
dover
do
you
know
that
big
landscape
that
hangs
in
holt
boudoir
that
was
one
of
his
he
hid
himself
away
and
died
in
a
garret
or
a
workhouse
something
cheerful
i
met
strangeways
at
brisbane
she
and
her
husband
were
she
might
look
in
this
afternoon
i
do
know
whether
you
would
care
for
her
she
rather
rapid
you
know
but
she
remembers
hearing
you
play
somewhere
spoke
of
you
with
great
admiration
alma
eyes
shone
i
should
be
glad
to
meet
her
are
you
going
to
let
me
stay
with
you
all
the
afternoon
then
you
have
nothing
better
to
do
i
suppose
i
shall
be
losing
you
presently
i
very
sorry
i
wish
you
lived
in
london
this
one
account
replied
alma
wish
i
did
but
i
got
so
out
of
it
do
you
think
i
carry
a
rustic
atmosphere
about
with
me
sibyl
laughed
in
the
tone
her
friend
wished
to
hear
alma
would
have
been
profoundly
mortified
if
carnaby
had
seemed
ever
so
little
to
agree
with
her
for
all
that
they
were
not
quite
so
well
attuned
to
each
other
as
when
the
young
married
woman
indifferent
seemingly
to
social
distinction
patronised
the
ambitious
girl
and
by
the
mere
bestowal
of
confidence
subtly
flattered
her
in
those
days
alma
did
not
feel
it
as
patronage
for
sibyl
social
position
was
perhaps
superior
to
her
own
and
in
things
of
the
intellect
apart
from
artistic
endowment
she
sincerely
looked
up
to
her
friend
together
they
trod
ground
above
the
heads
of
ordinary
women
in
their
world
but
changes
had
been
at
work
alma
now
felt
herself
to
say
the
least
on
equal
terms
with
carnaby
economically
she
was
secure
whereas
sibyl
notwithstanding
the
show
she
made
drew
daily
nearer
to
a
grave
crisis
and
might
before
long
find
herself
in
a
very
unpleasant
situation
intellectually
alma
saw
herself
in
a
less
modest
light
than
before
marriage
the
daily
companionship
of
such
a
man
as
her
husband
had
been
to
her
as
a
second
education
she
had
quite
overtaken
sibyl
if
not
gone
a
little
beyond
her
the
deference
she
still
showed
was
no
longer
genuine
and
this
kind
of
affectation
hard
to
support
and
readily
perceived
is
very
perilous
to
friendship
conscious
of
thoughts
she
must
not
utter
alma
naturally
attributed
to
her
friend
the
same
sort
of
reticence
she
feared
that
sibyl
must
often
have
in
mind
the
loss
she
had
suffered
three
years
ago
and
would
contrast
her
own
precarious
circumstances
with
the
comfort
of
bennet
frothingham
daughter
moreover
carnaby
was
not
in
all
respects
her
own
self
she
had
lost
something
on
her
travels
was
it
a
shade
of
personal
delicacy
of
mental
refinement
she
seemed
more
inclined
to
to
aim
somewhat
at
worldly
success
to
be
less
careful
about
the
friends
she
made
alma
felt
this
difference
though
not
clear
as
to
its
nature
and
insensibly
it
helped
to
draw
them
apart
hugh
is
at
coventry
said
sibyl
when
the
servant
had
withdrawn
go
backwards
and
forwards
you
know
i
do
think
he
have
very
much
to
do
practically
with
the
business
but
just
at
first
he
likes
to
see
what
going
on
hope
it
will
prosper
no
doubt
it
will
it
was
a
very
good
idea
sibyl
spoke
as
though
she
had
never
contemplated
the
possibilities
which
were
in
alma
mind
her
husband
as
alma
knew
from
rolfe
was
in
anything
but
a
sanguine
mood
he
saw
his
position
in
all
its
gravity
and
could
hardly
rest
for
fear
that
this
latest
enterprise
should
not
succeed
sibyl
however
enjoyed
her
lunch
with
complete
tranquillity
she
had
the
air
of
being
responsible
for
nothing
not
at
all
sorry
we
went
away
for
a
time
travelling
suits
hugh
it
has
done
him
a
great
deal
of
good
i
believe
he
would
have
liked
to
stay
in
tasmania
but
he
saw
it
would
do
for
me
and
the
good
fellow
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
my
comfort
i
have
a
great
admiration
for
hugh
she
added
with
a
smile
not
exactly
of
superiority
or
condescension
but
of
approval
distinct
from
tenderness
course
i
always
had
and
it
has
increased
since
i
travelled
with
him
he
shows
to
far
more
advantage
on
a
ship
than
in
a
on
this
last
voyage
we
had
some
very
bad
weather
and
then
he
was
at
his
best
i
admired
him
immensely
can
quite
imagine
how
he
would
be
said
alma
how
glad
i
was
when
i
heard
you
had
married
his
best
friend
it
had
crossed
my
mind
more
than
once
perhaps
you
do
remember
you
did
notice
it
at
the
time
but
i
ventured
a
discreet
hint
before
we
parted
you
could
have
done
a
more
sensible
thing
alma
though
quite
willing
to
believe
this
alma
for
some
reason
did
not
care
to
hear
it
thus
asserted
the
manner
of
the
remark
for
all
its
friendliness
reminded
her
that
marriage
had
signified
her
defeat
the
end
of
high
promises
brave
aspirations
could
tell
you
how
it
happened
she
said
with
a
little
awkwardness
i
dare
say
you
would
say
the
same
about
your
own
marriage
course
so
would
every
woman
one
never
does
know
how
it
and
sibyl
laughed
with
quiet
merriment
which
had
a
touch
of
cynicism
alma
had
not
yet
spoken
of
the
impulse
which
carried
her
away
to
the
little
house
in
carnarvonshire
to
the
life
of
noble
simplicity
and
calm
retirement
and
she
had
no
disposition
now
to
touch
on
the
matter
even
in
her
early
letters
to
sybil
not
much
was
said
of
it
for
she
felt
that
her
friend
might
have
a
difficulty
in
sympathising
with
such
enthusiasm
she
would
have
liked
to
make
sibyl
understand
that
her
rustication
was
quite
voluntary
but
the
subject
embarrassed
her
and
she
preferred
to
keep
silence
did
hear
very
much
about
your
time
in
germany
carnaby
resumed
much
to
tell
i
suppose
little
any
adventures
no
alma
felt
herself
grow
warm
less
at
the
thought
of
the
adventures
which
really
had
befallen
her
than
from
vexation
at
the
feeling
of
insignificance
she
understood
very
well
what
sibyl
meant
by
her
smiling
question
and
it
would
almost
have
been
a
relief
to
tell
certain
stories
in
proof
that
she
had
not
utterly
fallen
out
of
sight
and
mind
on
her
from
society
there
was
no
reason
indeed
why
she
should
not
make
fun
of
felix
dymes
and
his
proposal
but
the
episode
seemed
idle
in
comparison
with
another
on
which
she
had
never
ceased
to
reflect
perhaps
a
certain
glory
attached
to
that
second
incident
sibyl
might
be
impressed
alike
with
the
character
of
the
temptation
and
with
her
friend
nobility
in
scorning
it
but
the
opportunity
had
gone
by
on
rising
from
table
sibyl
remarked
that
she
wished
to
make
one
or
two
purchases
would
alma
accompany
her
to
the
shop
they
went
forth
and
drove
as
far
as
regent
street
carnaby
requirements
were
one
or
two
expensive
trifles
which
she
chose
with
leisurely
gratification
of
her
taste
it
surprised
alma
to
see
this
extravagance
one
would
have
thought
the
purchaser
had
never
known
restricted
means
and
dreamt
of
no
such
thing
she
bought
what
she
happened
to
desire
as
a
matter
of
course
and
this
was
no
ostentation
for
alma
benefit
evidently
sibyl
had
indulged
herself
with
the
same
freedom
throughout
her
travels
for
she
had
brought
back
a
museum
of
beautiful
and
curious
things
which
must
have
cost
a
good
deal
perhaps
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
alma
experienced
a
sense
of
indignation
at
the
waste
of
money
she
was
envious
withal
which
possibly
helped
to
explain
the
other
impulse
they
returned
in
an
hour
time
sibyl
then
withdrew
for
a
few
minutes
and
reappeared
in
an
exquisite
which
made
her
friend
frock
though
new
and
handsome
look
something
less
than
suitable
to
the
occasion
alma
glancing
about
the
room
spoke
as
if
in
pursuance
of
a
train
of
thought
make
a
lot
of
money
out
of
bicycles
i
think
have
heard
so
answered
her
hostess
indifferently
you
play
me
something
the
piano
has
been
tuned
i
should
like
to
know
if
you
think
it
all
right
have
quite
given
up
playing
the
piano
and
the
violin
too
no
the
violin
is
my
instrument
whose
is
that
little
sibyl
i
tried
for
just
that
effect
of
sun
through
mist
not
long
ago
yes
to
be
sure
you
have
gone
in
for
you
told
me
in
a
letter
i
must
see
some
of
your
things
of
course
i
shall
becoming
the
door
opened
and
a
small
page
very
smartly
equipped
to
alma
she
had
not
as
yet
seen
this
functionary
but
announced
herbert
strangeways
the
page
was
a
surprise
strangeways
drew
her
attention
a
lady
of
perhaps
with
keen
thin
face
and
an
artificial
bloom
on
her
hollow
cheeks
rather
overdressed
yet
not
to
the
point
of
vulgarity
of
figure
very
well
proportioned
slim
and
lissom
her
voice
was
a
trifle
hard
but
pleasant
her
manner
cordial
in
excess
here
you
are
charming
charming
the
prettiest
room
i
have
seen
for
a
long
time
rolfe
oh
rolfe
the
name
put
me
out
for
a
moment
but
i
remember
you
perfectly
perfectly
it
was
at
the
wigrams
you
played
the
violin
wonderfully
alma
did
not
much
care
to
be
reminded
of
this
wigram
one
of
her
father
was
lying
at
this
moment
in
durance
vile
and
his
wife
lived
somewhere
or
other
on
charity
but
strangeways
uttered
the
name
without
misgiving
and
behaved
as
though
nothing
conceivable
could
have
afforded
her
more
delight
than
to
meet
alma
again
it
was
her
habit
to
speak
in
superlatives
and
to
wear
a
countenance
of
corresponding
ecstasy
any
casual
remark
from
either
of
the
ladies
she
received
with
a
sort
of
rapture
her
nerves
seemed
to
be
in
a
perpetual
thrill
if
she
referred
to
herself
it
was
always
with
depreciation
and
not
at
all
the
kind
of
depreciation
which
invites
compliment
but
a
tremulous
such
as
might
be
natural
in
a
person
who
had
done
something
to
be
ashamed
of
and
held
her
place
in
society
only
on
sufferance
still
play
of
course
she
said
to
rolfe
presently
so
hope
i
may
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
you
again
i
wonder
whether
i
could
persuade
you
to
come
next
wednesday
we
have
a
little
house
in
porchester
terrace
of
course
i
do
mean
to
ask
you
to
play
i
should
venture
to
just
a
few
friends
in
the
evening
if
you
think
it
tiresome
i
send
you
a
card
there
entered
a
tall
young
man
of
consumptive
features
accompanied
by
a
stout
florid
woman
older
than
himself
and
upon
this
couple
followed
miscellaneous
callers
some
of
whom
alma
knew
these
old
acquaintances
met
her
with
a
curiosity
they
hardly
troubled
to
disguise
she
herself
was
reserved
and
took
no
part
in
the
general
chatter
strangeways
withdrew
into
a
corner
as
if
wishing
to
escape
observation
when
rolfe
took
a
chair
by
her
side
she
beamed
with
gratitude
and
their
gossip
grew
quite
intimate
alma
could
not
understand
why
sibyl
had
stigmatised
this
woman
as
that
is
to
say
she
gabbled
indeed
at
a
great
rate
but
revealed
no
startling
habits
of
life
or
thought
and
seemed
to
have
rather
an
inclination
for
childish
forms
of
amusement
before
they
parted
alma
gave
a
promise
that
she
would
go
to
strangeways
home
next
wednesday
your
husband
if
he
would
care
to
come
i
should
be
so
delighted
to
know
him
but
perhaps
he
does
care
about
that
kind
of
thing
i
hate
to
bore
anyone
do
you
but
then
of
course
you
never
in
danger
of
doing
it
so
very
glad
to
have
met
you
and
so
exceedingly
kind
of
you
to
promise
so
kind
as
sibyl
also
was
going
to
porchester
terrace
they
arranged
to
chaperon
each
other
and
to
start
from
rolfe
hotel
no
use
making
harvey
uncomfortable
said
alma
would
go
if
i
asked
him
but
sorely
against
the
grain
he
always
detested
homes
except
when
he
came
to
admire
and
he
likes
to
see
me
going
about
independently
he
said
sibyl
with
an
inquiring
look
seriously
we
do
our
best
not
to
encumber
each
other
do
you
think
it
the
best
way
doubt
whatever
carnaby
smiled
and
the
smile
grew
to
a
laugh
but
she
would
not
explain
what
she
meant
by
it
on
the
wednesday
evening
they
reached
strangeways
house
at
ten
carriages
and
cabs
made
a
queue
up
to
the
door
and
figures
succeeded
each
other
rapidly
on
the
red
cloth
laid
down
across
the
pavement
alma
was
nervous
more
than
three
years
had
passed
since
the
fatal
evening
when
all
unconsciously
she
said
goodbye
to
social
splendours
from
then
till
now
she
had
taken
part
in
no
festivity
the
fact
that
her
name
was
no
longer
frothingham
gave
her
some
encouragement
but
she
must
expect
to
be
recognised
perhaps
to
be
stared
at
well
and
would
it
be
so
very
disagreeable
an
hour
before
the
mirror
had
persuaded
her
that
she
need
not
shrink
from
eyes
her
dress
defied
criticism
and
she
had
not
to
learn
how
to
bear
herself
with
dignity
sibyl
was
unusually
lavish
of
compliments
and
in
a
matter
such
as
this
sibyl
judgment
had
weight
as
soon
as
she
found
herself
on
the
stairs
amid
perfumes
and
brilliances
she
breathed
freely
it
was
the
old
familiar
atmosphere
her
heart
leaped
with
a
sudden
joy
as
in
a
paradise
regained
already
the
guests
were
very
numerous
and
they
continued
to
arrive
the
filled
a
crowd
of
men
smoked
in
the
and
the
women
swarmed
in
passages
and
staircase
after
welcoming
rolfe
with
the
ardour
of
a
bosom
friend
and
the
prostration
of
a
devotee
the
hostess
turned
to
the
next
comer
with
scarcely
less
fervency
and
alma
passed
on
content
for
the
present
to
be
lost
amid
thronging
strangers
are
all
these
people
she
asked
of
sibyl
who
had
moved
along
by
her
side
most
of
them
i
should
imagine
there
no
need
to
stay
very
long
you
know
that
strangeways
the
little
man
with
a
red
face
talking
to
that
mountain
of
a
woman
in
green
mercy
what
a
dress
coming
this
way
i
introduce
him
to
you
the
host
had
a
jovial
carriage
and
a
bluff
way
of
speaking
both
obviously
affected
his
eyes
wandered
as
he
talked
and
never
met
anyone
else
with
a
steady
look
alma
thought
him
offensively
familiar
but
he
did
not
inflict
himself
upon
her
for
long
when
the
hostess
began
to
go
hither
and
thither
she
pounced
eagerly
on
rolfe
and
soon
made
her
the
centre
of
a
group
alma
began
to
taste
the
old
delight
of
homage
though
she
perceived
that
her
new
acquaintances
were
not
of
the
world
in
which
she
had
formerly
shone
about
midnight
when
she
was
a
little
tired
of
the
crush
and
thought
of
going
there
fell
upon
her
ear
a
voice
which
startled
and
aroused
her
like
an
unexpected
grasp
on
the
instant
she
saw
an
open
place
in
munich
the
next
a
lake
and
mountains
was
in
town
then
i
got
out
of
sorts
and
ran
away
to
a
little
place
i
have
on
the
lake
of
garda
the
speaker
was
immediately
behind
her
she
all
but
turned
her
head
and
grew
hot
in
the
effort
to
command
herself
amid
the
emotions
naturally
excited
in
her
she
was
impressed
by
a
quality
in
the
voice
a
refinement
of
utterance
which
at
once
distinguished
it
from
that
of
the
men
with
whom
she
had
been
talking
it
belonged
to
a
higher
social
grade
if
it
did
not
express
a
superiority
of
nature
for
some
moments
she
listened
catching
now
and
then
a
word
then
other
voices
intervened
at
length
turning
where
she
stood
she
let
her
eyes
range
expressionless
over
the
faces
near
by
that
which
she
sought
was
not
discoverable
but
at
the
same
moment
the
hostess
came
up
to
her
rolfe
do
you
know
cyrus
redgrave
redgrave
the
confused
hesitating
repetition
of
the
name
was
taken
by
mrs
strangeways
for
a
reply
in
the
negative
charming
man
and
a
great
friend
of
mine
oh
a
very
old
friend
let
me
bring
him
she
rustled
away
and
rolfe
sank
back
on
to
the
from
which
she
had
newly
risen
quickly
the
hostess
returned
and
in
the
track
she
made
through
crowded
clusters
of
people
who
stood
talking
there
followed
a
gentleman
of
easy
carriage
with
handsome
features
and
thin
hair
he
was
looking
for
alma
and
as
soon
as
his
eyes
perceived
her
they
fell
of
what
strangeways
said
alma
heard
not
a
syllable
she
bowed
mechanically
clutching
her
fan
as
though
in
peril
of
a
fall
and
this
the
only
thing
within
reach
she
knew
that
redgrave
bent
solemnly
silently
and
then
with
sudden
relief
she
saw
the
hostess
retire
beg
your
pardon
the
voice
was
addressing
her
in
a
respectful
undertone
had
no
choice
i
did
not
feel
justified
in
saying
i
knew
you
were
quite
right
she
replied
coldly
her
fingers
now
relaxed
upon
the
fan
strangeways
is
a
little
impulsive
she
gave
me
no
opportunity
of
preventing
the
introduction
you
let
me
say
rolfe
that
i
am
glad
to
have
been
presented
to
you
as
a
stranger
i
should
be
happy
indeed
if
our
acquaintance
might
begin
anew
it
was
polite
in
terms
but
sounded
to
alma
very
like
the
coolest
impertinence
she
bent
her
head
ever
so
little
the
second
seat
of
the
being
unoccupied
redgrave
hereupon
took
possession
of
it
no
sooner
had
he
done
so
than
alma
rose
let
a
smile
of
indifference
just
fall
upon
him
and
lost
herself
amid
the
buzzing
assembly
ten
minutes
later
redgrave
and
carnaby
were
lounging
in
these
same
seats
conversing
with
perfect
mutual
intelligence
they
had
not
met
for
three
years
but
the
interval
signified
very
little
in
their
lives
and
they
resumed
conversation
practically
at
the
point
where
it
had
broken
off
in
frothingham
a
tactful
question
assured
the
man
of
the
world
that
carnaby
knew
nothing
of
certain
passages
at
munich
and
bregenz
afraid
he
added
rolfe
has
become
a
little
reserved
natural
no
doubt
lives
in
a
wild
part
of
wales
sibyl
answered
smiling
tolerantly
her
husband
detests
society
odd
choice
for
her
to
have
made
do
you
think
and
so
your
odyssey
is
over
we
shall
have
some
chance
of
seeing
you
again
your
own
odyssey
is
perpetually
going
on
are
you
ever
in
town
except
for
a
few
weeks
of
the
season
i
go
about
very
little
now
i
settling
you
never
met
my
sister
i
think
she
has
a
house
at
wimbledon
with
a
garden
sort
of
little
park
in
fact
and
i
have
persuaded
her
to
let
me
build
myself
a
bungalow
among
the
trees
idea
bad
i
think
one
is
free
there
a
member
of
the
family
whenever
one
likes
domesticated
all
that
respectable
and
only
a
few
steps
away
the
bachelor
snuggery
with
all
that
no
no
i
was
going
to
complete
the
antithesis
though
by
your
smiling
you
seem
to
say
so
suggestion
was
irresistible
said
sibyl
with
the
composure
the
air
of
security
which
always
covered
her
excursions
on
to
slippery
ground
the
weather
is
good
i
ask
a
few
of
my
friends
to
come
and
sit
there
in
the
shade
they
may
or
may
not
be
my
sister
friends
also
that
does
matter
i
have
a
separate
entrance
from
the
but
i
wish
you
knew
fenimore
she
lived
a
year
or
two
at
stuttgart
for
her
children
to
learn
german
her
husband
in
india
she
tried
it
but
could
stand
the
climate
you
really
live
in
the
bungalow
inquired
carnaby
disregarding
this
information
about
redgrave
sister
it
my
headquarters
in
england
let
me
send
you
a
card
will
you
when
i
have
my
next
afternoon
it
might
amuse
you
and
i
assure
you
it
perfectly
respectable
could
i
doubt
it
if
you
invite
me
alma
drove
home
by
herself
in
a
hansom
she
liked
this
disregard
of
conventionalities
all
the
more
because
harvey
who
of
course
had
sat
up
for
her
seemed
a
trifle
anxious
her
spirits
were
exuberant
she
gave
a
merry
mocking
account
of
the
evening
but
it
included
no
mention
of
cyrus
redgrave
at
the
end
of
june
her
friends
the
leaches
moved
from
their
old
house
in
elgin
road
to
a
new
one
out
at
and
when
the
removal
was
completed
alma
went
there
to
make
a
call
taking
her
husband
harvey
had
never
been
beyond
swiss
cottage
on
this
extension
of
the
metropolitan
railway
he
looked
with
interest
at
the
new
districts
springing
up
towards
harrow
and
talked
of
them
with
leach
a
day
or
two
after
he
travelled
by
himself
to
a
greater
distance
on
the
same
line
making
a
survey
of
the
country
from
harrow
to
aylesbury
at
his
next
meeting
with
hugh
carnaby
which
took
place
about
the
middle
of
july
he
threw
out
a
suggestion
that
for
anyone
who
wished
to
live
practically
in
london
and
yet
away
from
its
frenzy
the
uplands
towards
buckinghamshire
were
convenient
ground
wish
you
were
thinking
of
it
yourself
replied
hugh
wife
is
about
the
only
woman
sibyl
cares
to
see
much
of
and
the
only
woman
i
know
that
she
get
any
good
from
the
strong
man
did
not
look
very
cheerfully
on
the
world
just
now
and
it
was
evident
that
he
felt
some
sort
of
trouble
with
regard
to
his
wife
for
her
sake
solely
he
had
returned
to
england
where
he
was
less
than
ever
at
his
ease
he
wished
sibyl
to
live
in
her
own
way
grudged
her
nothing
admired
and
cherished
her
with
undiminished
fervour
but
in
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
it
cost
him
a
great
effort
to
pretend
to
be
at
home
the
years
of
wandering
had
put
him
hopelessly
out
of
touch
with
what
sibyl
called
society
little
as
he
understood
about
manufactures
or
cared
for
the
details
of
commerce
he
preferred
to
stay
down
at
coventry
with
his
partner
mackintosh
living
roughly
smoking
his
pipe
and
drinking
his
whisky
in
the
company
of
men
who
had
at
least
a
savour
of
sturdy
manhood
his
days
of
sport
were
gone
by
he
was
risking
the
solid
remnant
of
his
capital
and
if
it
vanished
but
of
that
possibility
he
would
not
speak
even
with
harvey
rolfe
as
he
meditated
his
teeth
were
set
his
eyes
darkened
and
it
appeared
to
harvey
that
the
good
fellow
drank
a
little
more
whisky
than
was
needful
even
in
these
warm
days
want
to
see
the
little
chap
my
namesake
he
said
do
you
have
him
up
here
does
your
wife
feel
she
wants
him
will
think
more
of
him
in
a
year
or
two
harvey
replied
i
noticed
that
women
one
sort
of
women
do
care
much
about
babies
nowadays
i
dare
say
they
right
the
fewer
children
people
have
the
better
it
bad
to
see
the
poor
little
squalling
brats
in
the
filth
and
smoke
down
yonder
and
worse
still
in
this
damned
london
great
god
when
there
so
much
of
the
world
clean
and
sweet
here
we
pack
and
swelter
together
a
million
to
the
square
mile
what
eternal
fools
we
are
harvey
growled
his
heartiest
agreement
none
the
less
a
day
or
two
after
he
was
holding
a
conversation
with
alma
which
encouraged
her
secret
weariness
of
the
clean
and
sweet
places
of
the
earth
they
had
come
home
from
a
richter
concert
and
alma
uttered
a
regret
that
she
had
not
her
violin
here
a
certain
introduced
by
a
certain
player
into
a
certain
violin
solo
did
not
please
her
why
she
could
extemporise
a
far
more
in
keeping
with
the
spirit
of
the
piece
after
listening
with
small
attention
to
the
matter
but
much
to
the
ardent
speech
and
face
of
enthusiasm
harvey
made
a
quiet
remark
want
you
to
decide
very
soon
what
we
are
going
to
do
to
do
the
future
where
we
are
to
live
alma
strummed
lightly
with
her
upon
the
table
and
smiled
but
did
not
look
up
you
really
think
of
making
any
change
leave
it
entirely
to
you
you
remember
our
last
talk
before
we
came
away
you
have
simply
to
ask
yourself
what
your
needs
are
be
honest
with
yourself
and
with
me
do
sacrifice
life
to
a
whim
one
way
or
the
other
you
have
had
plenty
of
time
to
think
you
have
known
several
ways
of
life
you
old
enough
to
understand
yourself
just
make
up
your
mind
and
act
it
ridiculous
harvey
to
speak
as
if
i
had
only
myself
to
consider
do
want
you
to
do
so
but
supposing
that
were
your
position
now
after
all
your
experience
where
would
you
choose
to
live
he
constrained
her
to
answer
and
at
length
she
spoke
with
a
girlish
diffidence
which
seemed
to
him
very
charming
like
the
concerts
and
i
like
to
be
near
my
musical
friends
and
i
do
think
it
at
all
necessary
to
give
up
one
rational
way
of
living
just
because
one
is
in
london
instead
of
far
away
that
means
we
ought
to
come
back
if
you
do
it
unwillingly
be
frank
in
my
turn
for
hughie
sake
i
do
think
we
ought
to
live
in
the
town
but
it
easy
enough
to
find
healthy
places
just
outside
should
wish
to
be
actually
in
the
town
said
alma
her
voice
tremulous
with
pleasure
know
where
the
leaches
are
living
or
just
a
little
farther
away
on
the
higher
ground
very
well
let
us
regard
as
settled
you
dear
could
you
live
there
enough
it
all
the
same
to
me
if
i
have
my
books
and
a
field
to
walk
in
and
if
you
do
want
me
to
see
too
many
women
alma
laughed
gaily
and
had
done
with
semblance
of
hesitation
they
began
to
search
for
a
house
and
in
a
week
time
had
found
one
newly
built
which
seemed
to
answer
their
requirements
it
was
at
pinner
not
many
minutes
by
rail
from
alma
friends
at
and
only
about
half
an
hour
from
baker
street
convenient
for
the
concerts
a
new
house
might
be
damp
but
the
summer
months
were
hastening
to
dry
it
and
they
would
not
enter
into
residence
before
the
end
of
autumn
must
go
and
enjoy
our
heather
said
alma
brightly
the
rent
was
twice
what
harvey
had
been
paying
there
was
no
stabling
but
alma
agreed
that
they
ought
not
to
keep
a
horse
for
naturally
there
would
be
expenses
other
expenses
to
be
sure
but
harvey
signed
the
three
years
lease
without
misgiving
a
large
surplus
lay
in
hand
after
the
in
carnarvonshire
and
his
position
was
not
that
of
men
who
have
extravagant
wives
chapter
the
leach
family
gave
it
to
be
understood
by
their
friends
that
they
had
moved
out
of
town
because
of
leach
health
other
explanations
were
suspected
for
the
new
establishment
seemed
to
be
on
a
more
modest
footing
than
that
in
elgin
road
and
the
odd
arrangement
whereby
leach
came
home
only
on
saturday
could
not
be
without
significance
leach
it
was
true
suffered
from
some
obscure
affection
of
the
nerves
which
throughout
the
whole
of
her
married
life
had
disabled
her
from
paying
any
continuous
regard
to
domestic
affairs
this
debility
had
now
reached
such
a
point
that
the
unfortunate
lady
could
do
nothing
but
collapse
in
chairs
and
loll
on
sofas
as
her
two
daughters
though
not
debilitated
had
never
dreamt
of
undertaking
household
management
all
such
matters
were
left
to
a
changed
every
few
months
generally
after
a
quarrel
wherein
leach
put
forth
for
an
invalid
very
surprising
energy
leach
a
solicitor
had
no
function
in
life
but
to
toil
without
pause
for
the
support
of
his
family
in
genteel
leisure
he
was
a
mild
man
dreading
discord
and
subservient
to
his
wife
for
many
years
he
had
made
an
income
of
about
every
penny
of
which
excepting
a
small
insurance
premium
had
been
absorbed
by
expenses
of
the
house
at
the
age
of
fifty
prematurely
worn
by
excessive
labour
he
was
alarmed
to
find
his
income
steadily
diminishing
with
no
corresponding
diminution
but
rather
the
opposite
in
the
demands
made
upon
him
by
wife
and
daughters
in
a
moment
of
courage
prompted
by
desperation
he
obtained
the
consent
of
dora
and
gerda
to
this
unwelcome
change
of
abode
it
caused
so
much
unpleasantness
between
himself
and
leach
that
he
was
glad
to
fit
up
a
at
his
office
and
go
home
only
once
a
week
whereby
he
saved
time
and
had
the
opportunity
of
starving
himself
as
well
as
of
working
himself
to
death
dora
and
gerda
having
grown
up
in
such
domestic
circumstances
accepted
them
with
equanimity
when
their
father
spoke
nervously
of
retrenchment
saying
that
he
grew
old
and
must
save
money
to
provide
for
their
future
they
made
no
objection
but
were
as
far
as
ever
from
perceiving
the
sordid
tragedy
of
his
lot
dora
lived
for
her
music
gerda
sang
a
little
but
was
stronger
on
the
social
side
delighting
in
festivities
and
amusements
they
were
amiable
and
intelligent
girls
and
would
have
been
amazed
had
anyone
charged
them
with
selfishness
no
less
if
it
had
been
suggested
to
them
that
they
personally
might
rectify
the
domestic
disorder
of
which
at
times
they
were
moved
to
complain
they
had
no
beauty
and
knew
it
neither
had
received
an
offer
of
marriage
and
they
looked
for
nothing
of
the
kind
that
their
dresses
cost
a
great
deal
was
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
also
that
they
should
go
abroad
when
other
people
did
and
have
the
best
places
at
concert
or
theatre
and
be
expansively
home
with
all
sincerity
they
said
of
themselves
that
they
lived
a
quiet
life
how
could
it
be
quieter
unless
one
followed
the
example
of
alma
rolfe
but
alma
was
quite
an
exceptional
person
to
be
admired
and
liked
not
to
be
imitated
yet
even
alma
it
seemed
had
got
tired
of
her
extraordinary
freak
she
was
back
again
within
the
circle
of
civilisation
or
as
she
put
it
in
her
original
amusing
way
the
outer
edge
of
the
whirlpool
she
had
a
very
nice
little
house
beautifully
furnished
everyone
knew
alma
excellent
taste
she
came
frequently
to
and
ran
up
to
town
at
least
as
often
as
they
dora
and
gerda
did
like
them
she
found
it
an
annoyance
to
have
to
rush
to
the
station
before
midnight
but
being
married
she
could
allow
herself
more
freedom
of
movement
than
was
permissible
to
single
young
women
and
having
once
missed
the
last
train
she
simply
went
to
a
hotel
where
she
was
known
and
quietly
returned
to
pinner
next
morning
that
rolfe
had
such
complete
liberty
and
leisure
seemed
to
them
no
subject
for
remark
being
without
cares
she
enjoyed
life
a
matter
of
course
and
she
was
so
very
clever
no
wonder
rolfe
charming
man
always
had
admiration
in
his
eyes
when
he
looked
at
her
some
husbands
miserable
churls
can
see
nothing
in
their
wives
and
never
think
of
encouraging
what
talent
they
may
have
but
when
alma
grew
a
little
dissatisfied
with
her
violin
a
which
poor
bennet
frothingham
had
given
her
in
the
days
gone
by
rolfe
did
not
hesitate
to
spend
fifty
pounds
on
an
instrument
more
to
her
liking
and
the
dear
girl
played
on
it
divinely
there
was
no
shadow
of
envy
in
dora
leach
do
play
quite
badly
she
said
to
alma
knows
i
ought
to
after
all
the
lessons
i
had
and
the
pains
i
given
but
with
you
it
different
dear
you
know
very
well
that
if
you
liked
you
could
become
a
professional
and
make
a
name
have
done
alma
admitted
marriage
put
an
end
to
that
you
have
too
much
sense
to
think
i
mean
that
i
repent
it
do
see
why
marriage
should
put
an
end
to
it
urged
dora
quite
sure
your
husband
would
be
very
proud
if
you
came
out
and
had
a
great
success
if
i
came
out
and
made
a
fiasco
would
that
was
in
the
summer
of
when
the
rolfes
had
been
living
at
pinner
for
eight
months
the
new
violin
new
to
her
old
and
mellow
in
itself
had
inspired
alma
to
joyous
exertions
again
she
took
lessons
from
herr
wilenski
who
was
sparing
of
compliment
but
by
the
mere
fact
of
receiving
her
at
all
showed
his
good
opinion
and
many
other
people
encouraged
her
in
a
fine
conceit
of
herself
strangeways
called
her
unrecognised
genius
and
worshipped
at
her
feet
to
be
sure
one
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
strangeways
but
it
is
sweet
to
hear
such
phrases
and
twice
already
though
against
her
better
judgment
alma
had
consented
to
play
at
that
lady
house
on
both
these
occasions
cyrus
redgrave
was
present
choosing
his
moment
he
approached
her
looked
in
her
face
with
a
certain
timidity
to
which
alma
was
not
insensible
and
spoke
as
an
ordinary
acquaintance
there
was
no
helping
it
the
man
had
been
formally
introduced
and
as
he
suggested
they
had
begun
to
know
each
other
afresh
alma
liked
to
remember
how
severely
she
had
treated
him
at
that
first
encounter
perhaps
that
was
enough
for
dignity
redgrave
would
hardly
forget
himself
again
for
the
rest
she
could
not
pretend
within
herself
to
dislike
him
and
if
he
paid
homage
to
her
beauty
to
her
social
charm
to
her
musical
gifts
all
of
which
things
alma
recognised
and
tabulated
it
might
be
only
just
to
let
him
make
amends
for
something
known
to
both
of
them
the
insult
alma
was
far
from
forgiving
but
when
she
had
talked
twice
with
redgrave
distantly
as
a
stranger
to
all
his
affairs
it
began
to
steal
upon
her
mind
that
there
would
be
a
sweetly
subtle
satisfaction
in
allowing
the
man
to
imagine
that
her
coldness
was
not
quite
what
it
seemed
that
so
perchance
he
might
be
drawn
on
and
become
enslaved
she
had
never
been
able
to
congratulate
herself
on
a
conquest
of
cyrus
redgrave
the
memory
of
bregenz
could
still
at
moments
bring
the
blood
to
her
face
for
it
was
a
memory
of
cool
calculating
outrage
not
of
passion
that
had
broken
bounds
to
subdue
the
man
in
good
earnest
would
be
another
thing
and
a
peculiarly
delicious
morsel
of
revenge
was
it
possible
not
long
ago
she
would
have
scoffed
at
the
thought
deeming
redgrave
incapable
of
love
in
any
shape
but
her
mind
was
changing
in
an
atmosphere
of
pleasure
and
flattery
and
under
the
influence
of
talk
such
as
she
heard
in
this
house
and
one
or
two
others
like
it
to
her
husband
she
represented
strangeways
as
a
very
pleasant
woman
with
a
passion
for
all
the
arts
formerly
wife
of
a
painter
and
now
married
to
a
wealthy
man
who
shared
her
tastes
this
satisfied
harvey
but
alma
had
not
deceived
herself
and
could
not
be
quite
comfortable
with
strangeways
she
no
longer
puzzled
over
the
flow
of
guests
to
the
house
in
porchester
terrace
having
discovered
not
only
that
most
of
these
were
people
as
sibyl
said
of
no
account
who
had
few
houses
open
to
them
but
that
several
would
not
be
admitted
to
any
circle
of
scrupulous
respectability
the
fact
was
that
strangeways
largely
entertained
the
to
use
in
its
true
sense
a
term
persistently
misapplied
not
impossibly
she
thought
the
daughter
of
bennet
frothingham
might
from
one
point
of
view
be
included
among
such
persons
on
the
other
hand
her
warmth
proved
that
she
regarded
rolfe
as
a
social
acquisition
if
indeed
she
was
not
genuinely
attracted
to
her
what
circumstances
had
led
or
forced
strangeways
into
this
peculiar
position
alma
could
not
discover
it
might
be
simply
one
result
of
an
unfortunate
marriage
for
undoubtedly
there
was
something
sinister
in
the
husband
a
coarseness
varnished
with
sham
geniality
which
made
alma
dislike
to
be
near
him
in
the
woman
herself
she
found
little
that
was
objectionable
her
foolish
effusiveness
and
her
artificial
complexion
seemed
to
indicate
merely
a
weak
character
at
times
her
talk
was
interesting
and
she
knew
many
people
of
a
class
superior
to
that
represented
in
her
but
for
the
illumination
she
had
received
alma
would
have
felt
surprised
at
meeting
cyrus
redgrave
in
these
assemblies
formerly
she
had
thought
of
him
as
belonging
to
a
sphere
somewhat
above
her
own
a
world
in
which
sibyl
carnaby
the
daughter
of
ascott
larkfield
also
moved
by
right
of
birth
and
breeding
sibyl
however
was
not
above
accepting
strangeways
invitations
though
she
continued
to
speak
of
her
slightingly
and
redgrave
had
known
the
lady
for
a
long
time
even
it
appeared
before
her
first
marriage
in
a
year
time
alma
had
made
and
renewed
a
large
number
of
acquaintances
she
spoke
of
herself
as
living
the
country
and
still
professed
a
dislike
of
mere
gaiety
a
resolve
to
maintain
her
simple
serious
mode
of
existence
at
journey
from
town
she
was
protected
against
the
intrusion
of
babblers
a
luncheon
or
two
in
the
season
and
a
modest
dinner
at
long
intervals
would
discharge
her
social
liabilities
and
she
had
the
precious
advantage
of
being
able
to
use
london
for
all
legitimate
purposes
without
danger
of
being
drawn
into
the
vortex
of
its
idle
temptations
once
more
she
was
working
earnestly
at
her
music
much
it
seemed
to
harvey
satisfaction
he
wanted
her
to
go
on
also
with
but
she
pointed
out
to
him
that
one
art
was
all
she
had
time
for
all
very
well
for
mere
amateurs
to
take
up
things
i
aim
at
more
than
that
you
would
like
me
would
you
to
become
really
as
a
violinist
harvey
assented
you
understand
she
pursued
regarding
him
with
her
bright
smile
the
life
of
an
artist
ca
be
quite
like
that
of
other
women
course
i
understand
it
you
know
i
do
wish
to
put
the
least
restraint
upon
you
one
fear
was
that
you
might
think
i
went
about
rather
too
much
did
pay
enough
attention
to
home
manage
pretty
well
i
think
you
need
have
any
such
fear
course
when
hughie
gets
older
when
i
can
really
begin
to
teach
him
the
child
was
now
approaching
the
close
of
his
third
year
and
in
harvey
opinion
needed
more
than
the
attention
of
an
ordinary
nursemaid
they
had
recently
engaged
a
her
name
pauline
smith
a
girl
of
fair
education
and
gentle
breeding
who
lived
as
a
member
of
the
family
it
appeared
to
rolfe
that
hughie
was
quite
old
enough
to
benefit
by
his
mother
guidance
and
companionship
but
he
had
left
himself
no
ground
for
objection
to
alma
ordering
of
her
life
the
welsh
servant
ruth
still
remained
with
them
acting
to
a
great
extent
as
housekeeper
and
having
under
her
a
maid
and
a
boy
ruth
a
trustworthy
woman
was
so
well
paid
that
they
had
not
to
fear
her
desertion
regularity
and
comfort
prevailed
to
a
much
greater
extent
than
might
have
been
looked
for
under
the
circumstances
expenditure
had
of
course
greatly
increased
and
now
touched
the
limit
of
harvey
ordinary
income
but
this
was
a
matter
which
did
not
immediately
concern
rolfe
for
domestic
and
private
purposes
she
had
a
of
her
own
an
arrangement
made
on
their
removal
to
pinner
when
harvey
one
morning
handed
her
a
and
a
remarking
that
she
would
find
to
her
credit
a
couple
of
hundred
pounds
alma
pretended
to
think
this
unnecessary
but
her
countenance
betrayed
pleasure
when
he
thought
the
fund
must
be
nearly
exhausted
he
made
a
new
payment
to
the
account
without
saying
anything
and
alma
preserved
an
equally
discreet
silence
one
of
her
new
acquaintances
was
rayner
mann
a
lady
who
desired
to
be
known
as
the
patroness
of
young
people
aiming
at
success
on
the
stage
or
as
musicians
many
stories
were
told
of
mann
generosity
to
struggling
artists
and
her
house
at
putney
swarmed
with
the
strangest
mingling
of
people
some
undoubtedly
in
society
others
no
less
decidedly
out
of
it
here
alma
encountered
felix
dymes
whose
reputation
and
prosperity
had
much
advanced
since
their
meeting
at
munich
the
comic
opera
of
which
he
then
spoke
had
been
brought
out
at
a
provincial
theatre
with
considerable
success
and
was
shortly
to
be
produced
in
london
his
latest
songs
light
of
home
and
the
willow
dips
had
caught
the
ear
of
the
multitude
alma
ridiculed
these
compositions
mocking
at
the
sentimentalism
of
the
words
and
declaring
that
the
airs
were
mere
popular
tinkle
but
people
not
inferior
to
her
in
judgment
liked
the
music
which
certainly
had
a
sweetness
and
pathos
not
easy
to
resist
the
wonder
was
how
such
a
man
as
felix
dymes
could
give
birth
to
such
tender
melody
the
vivacity
of
his
greeting
when
of
a
sudden
he
recognised
alma
contrasted
markedly
with
cyrus
redgrave
embarrassment
in
the
like
situation
dymes
had
an
easy
conscience
and
in
the
chat
that
followed
he
went
so
far
as
to
joke
about
his
some
four
years
ago
did
think
much
of
me
but
i
going
ahead
you
know
you
have
to
admit
i
going
ahead
prosperity
was
manifest
in
his
look
and
voice
he
had
made
no
advance
in
refinement
and
evidently
thought
himself
above
the
necessity
of
affecting
suave
manners
his
features
seemed
to
grow
even
coarser
his
was
persistent
to
the
point
of
grotesque
conceit
your
husband
musical
he
asked
particularly
there
something
to
be
said
for
that
one
does
always
want
to
be
talking
i
ca
help
looking
at
you
you
altered
in
a
queer
sort
of
way
you
were
awfully
fetching
you
know
in
those
days
were
awfully
impertinent
replied
alma
with
a
laugh
i
do
see
that
you
altered
at
all
in
that
respect
you
play
still
good
deal
better
than
i
used
to
if
it
true
why
do
you
come
out
i
always
believed
in
you
i
did
really
there
no
better
proof
of
it
than
what
i
said
at
munich
you
were
the
only
girl
that
could
have
brought
me
to
that
you
know
it
was
quite
against
my
principles
have
you
heard
of
ada
wellington
a
girl
i
going
to
bring
out
next
spring
a
pianist
and
she
make
a
hit
i
should
like
you
to
know
her
do
you
mean
you
are
going
to
bring
her
out
all
the
business
for
her
you
know
run
the
show
not
as
a
speculation
i
do
want
to
make
anything
out
of
it
more
than
expenses
i
know
her
they
very
badly
off
and
i
shall
be
glad
if
i
can
do
them
a
good
turn
there
nothing
between
us
just
friends
that
all
if
ever
you
come
out
put
the
business
into
my
hands
will
you
wo
promise
replied
alma
i
see
how
you
succeed
with
miss
wellington
it
be
an
understanding
if
i
float
ada
you
let
me
have
a
try
with
you
talk
of
it
dymes
when
you
have
learnt
the
elements
of
good
manners
she
nodded
in
a
friendly
way
and
left
him
their
next
meeting
was
at
a
where
dymes
came
in
whilst
alma
was
making
purchases
the
composer
clad
in
a
heavy
fur
overcoat
entered
humming
a
tune
loudly
by
way
of
he
was
at
home
here
for
the
proprietors
of
the
business
published
his
songs
on
perceiving
alma
he
dropped
his
blustering
air
bowed
with
exaggerated
politeness
and
professed
himself
overjoyed
looked
in
just
to
try
over
a
thing
i
got
in
my
head
do
come
and
listen
to
it
will
you
it
would
be
so
kind
of
you
to
give
me
your
opinion
he
pointed
to
a
room
at
the
back
visible
between
plush
curtains
alma
wishing
to
refuse
murmured
that
she
had
very
little
time
but
dymes
prevailed
and
she
followed
him
they
passed
into
the
pleasant
warmth
of
a
blazing
fire
the
musician
flung
off
his
coat
and
at
once
sat
down
at
the
grand
piano
open
for
the
convenience
of
such
favoured
persons
as
himself
whilst
alma
seated
herself
in
an
which
she
had
pushed
forward
so
as
to
allow
of
her
being
seen
from
the
shop
after
some
preliminary
jingling
dymes
played
an
air
which
the
listener
could
not
but
like
a
dainty
tripping
melody
fit
for
a
fairy
song
with
strange
little
echoes
as
of
laughter
and
a
sadness
in
the
close
with
hands
suspended
dymes
turned
to
see
the
effect
he
had
produced
that
your
own
alma
asked
under
that
impression
rather
good
i
think
do
you
pretty
she
hardly
believed
his
assurance
so
strong
was
the
contrast
between
that
lightsome
lyric
and
the
coarse
vanity
of
the
man
himself
he
played
it
again
and
she
liked
it
still
better
uttering
a
more
decided
word
of
praise
must
write
me
patter
for
that
dymes
exclaimed
when
he
saw
that
she
smiled
with
pleasure
do
know
dicky
wellington
a
cousin
of
ada
her
concert
will
be
at
the
end
of
may
prince
hall
most
likely
you
shall
have
a
ticket
kind
of
you
know
that
rayner
mann
is
giving
a
charity
concert
next
week
have
been
asked
to
take
part
in
it
said
alma
quietly
awfully
glad
of
that
shouted
dymes
i
shall
hear
you
again
the
fact
is
you
know
i
do
think
of
you
as
an
amateur
i
stand
amateurs
except
one
or
two
i
got
it
into
my
head
that
been
one
of
us
and
retired
queer
thing
is
it
alma
enjoyed
the
flattery
comfortable
in
her
chair
she
showed
no
disposition
to
move
dymes
asked
her
what
she
thought
of
playing
and
she
told
him
hauser
hongroise
always
being
bored
by
amateurs
he
resumed
silly
woman
who
belongs
to
a
symphony
society
asked
me
yesterday
to
go
and
hear
her
play
in
the
c
minor
i
begged
to
be
told
what
harm
i
had
ever
done
her
and
she
said
i
was
very
rude
but
i
always
am
to
people
of
that
sort
i
ca
help
it
another
of
them
asked
me
to
tell
her
of
a
piece
for
the
piano
a
really
nice
piece
at
once
i
suggested
chopin
a
flat
major
polonaise
do
you
know
it
course
i
do
could
you
play
it
yourself
of
course
not
you
do
imagine
that
because
one
is
a
successful
composer
he
must
be
a
brilliant
virtuoso
i
hardly
ever
touch
a
musical
instrument
wagner
was
a
very
poor
player
and
berlioz
simply
play
at
all
i
a
musical
dreamer
do
you
know
that
i
literally
dreamt
the
light
of
home
now
that
a
proof
of
genius
alma
laughed
it
is
do
you
know
how
most
songs
get
made
nowadays
sykes
come
when
the
dawn
you
remember
it
i
happen
to
know
all
about
that
a
fellow
about
town
somehow
got
hold
of
an
idea
for
a
melody
he
did
know
a
note
but
he
whistled
it
to
sykes
and
sykes
dotted
it
down
now
sykes
knows
no
more
of
harmony
than
a
broomstick
so
he
got
another
man
to
harmonise
it
and
then
a
fourth
fellow
wrote
an
orchestral
accompaniment
that
the
kind
of
thing
division
of
labour
in
art
quite
sure
you
do
everything
for
yourself
said
alma
mischievously
rising
at
length
forgive
you
because
you
really
one
of
us
you
are
you
know
you
have
the
look
of
an
amateur
now
when
you
gone
out
i
ask
sammy
behind
the
counter
there
who
he
thinks
you
are
and
i
give
rayner
mann
a
guinea
for
her
charity
if
he
does
take
you
for
a
professional
musician
will
be
good
enough
dymes
said
alma
severely
to
speak
of
me
at
all
to
anyone
behind
a
counter
was
only
a
joke
of
course
i
should
have
done
anything
of
the
kind
goodbye
shall
see
you
at
putney
for
all
that
no
sooner
was
rolfe
gone
than
dymes
did
talk
of
her
with
the
salesman
and
in
a
way
peculiar
to
his
species
managing
with
leers
and
to
suggest
not
only
that
the
lady
was
a
performer
of
distinction
but
that
like
women
in
general
she
had
found
his
genius
and
his
person
fatally
attractive
dymes
had
the
little
weaknesses
of
the
artistic
temperament
as
usual
rayner
mann
concert
was
well
attended
and
violin
solo
though
an
audience
more
critical
than
she
had
yet
faced
made
her
very
nervous
to
begin
with
received
much
applause
felix
dymes
not
being
able
to
get
a
seat
at
her
side
stood
behind
her
and
whispered
his
admiration
gone
ahead
tremendously
that
is
amateur
playing
all
the
others
are
not
fit
to
be
heard
in
the
same
day
really
you
know
you
ought
to
think
of
coming
out
many
other
persons
were
only
less
complimentary
and
one
mrs
strangeways
was
even
more
so
she
exhausted
herself
in
terms
of
glowing
eulogy
at
the
end
of
the
concert
this
lady
drew
alma
apart
rolfe
i
wonder
whether
i
could
ask
you
to
do
me
a
kindness
are
you
in
any
hurry
to
get
home
it
was
six
on
an
evening
of
january
delighted
with
her
success
alma
felt
very
much
like
a
young
man
whose
exuberant
spirits
urge
him
to
a
night
of
it
she
declared
that
she
was
in
no
hurry
at
all
and
would
be
only
too
glad
to
do
strangeways
any
kindness
in
her
power
will
sound
rather
odd
to
you
pursued
the
lady
in
a
low
voice
i
would
rather
trust
you
than
anyone
else
you
know
that
redgrave
and
i
are
very
old
friends
such
old
friends
that
we
are
really
almost
like
brother
and
sister
alma
nodded
heard
us
speak
of
his
bungalow
at
wimbledon
just
now
he
is
in
paris
and
he
happens
to
want
a
portrait
a
photograph
out
of
an
album
in
the
bungalow
naturally
he
would
have
asked
his
sister
to
look
for
it
and
send
it
but
fenimore
is
also
away
from
home
so
he
has
written
to
me
and
begged
me
to
do
him
the
kindness
i
know
exactly
where
the
photo
is
to
be
looked
for
and
all
i
have
to
do
is
to
drive
over
to
wimbledon
and
a
servant
will
be
waiting
to
admit
me
now
you
will
think
it
childish
but
i
really
do
like
to
go
alone
though
mr
redgrave
and
i
are
such
great
friends
of
course
i
have
only
been
to
the
bungalow
when
he
had
people
there
and
of
course
it
very
foolish
at
my
age
but
i
sure
you
understand
me
mean
you
would
like
me
to
go
with
you
said
alma
with
uncertain
voice
i
ask
it
dear
rolfe
there
will
be
one
but
the
servant
who
is
told
to
expect
a
friend
of
her
master
i
am
foolish
but
one
can
not
be
too
careful
you
know
and
with
i
shall
feel
everything
so
simple
and
natural
and
straightforward
sure
you
understand
me
faltered
alma
i
will
go
how
sweet
of
you
dear
need
i
say
that
i
should
never
breathe
a
word
to
redgrave
he
will
think
i
went
alone
as
of
course
i
very
well
might
if
the
servant
should
mention
to
him
dear
keep
your
fall
down
and
then
it
is
perfectly
certain
he
will
never
ask
a
question
he
thinks
it
such
a
trivial
matter
alma
did
not
entertain
the
least
doubt
of
her
friend
veracity
and
the
desire
to
have
a
companion
on
such
an
expedition
seemed
to
her
natural
enough
yet
she
felt
so
uneasy
at
the
thought
of
what
she
had
consented
to
do
that
even
whilst
descending
the
stairs
she
all
but
stopped
and
begged
to
be
excused
the
thought
of
stealing
into
redgrave
bachelor
home
even
with
strangeways
startled
and
offended
her
it
seemed
an
immodesty
she
had
never
been
invited
to
the
bungalow
though
carnaby
had
received
and
accepted
such
an
invitation
for
an
afternoon
in
the
summer
when
strangeways
did
the
honours
redgrave
was
now
scrupulously
respectful
he
would
not
presume
so
far
on
their
revived
acquaintance
as
to
ask
her
to
wimbledon
for
this
very
reason
and
for
others
she
had
a
curiosity
about
the
bungalow
its
exotic
name
affected
her
imagination
as
did
the
knowledge
that
cyrus
redgrave
whom
she
knew
so
particularly
well
had
built
it
for
his
retreat
his
privacy
curiosity
and
fear
of
offending
strangeways
overcame
her
serious
reluctance
on
entering
the
carriage
she
blushed
hotly
it
was
the
first
time
in
her
life
that
she
had
acted
with
deliberate
disregard
of
grave
moral
compunction
and
conscience
revenged
itself
by
lowering
her
in
her
own
eyes
strangeways
talked
all
the
way
but
not
once
of
redgrave
her
theme
was
the
excellence
of
alma
playing
which
she
declared
had
moved
everyone
with
wonder
and
delight
people
took
it
for
granted
that
you
were
a
professional
violinist
i
heard
one
man
saying
how
is
it
i
do
know
her
name
of
course
your
playing
in
an
amateur
is
altogether
exceptional
did
it
ever
occur
to
you
to
come
forward
professionally
thought
of
it
once
before
my
marriage
you
really
did
i
not
at
all
surprised
would
rolfe
look
with
disapproval
hardly
know
replied
alma
who
was
not
mistress
of
herself
and
paid
little
attention
to
what
she
was
saying
dare
say
he
mind
much
one
way
or
another
the
intimate
significance
of
this
word
warned
alma
that
she
had
spoken
too
carelessly
she
hastened
to
add
that
of
course
in
such
a
matter
her
husband
wish
would
be
final
and
that
she
had
never
thought
of
seeking
his
opinion
on
the
subject
ever
you
take
that
step
my
dear
it
will
mean
a
great
triumph
for
you
oh
a
great
triumph
and
there
is
room
just
now
for
a
lady
violinist
do
you
think
one
has
to
take
into
account
other
things
besides
mastery
of
the
instrument
with
the
public
naturally
a
beautiful
face
and
a
perfect
figure
this
was
too
much
even
for
alma
greediness
of
flattery
she
interrupted
the
smooth
warm
adulation
with
impatient
protest
and
told
herself
though
she
did
not
quite
know
the
reason
that
after
that
day
she
would
see
less
of
strangeways
the
carriage
stopped
glancing
to
either
side
alma
saw
that
they
were
in
a
country
road
its
darkness
broken
at
this
spot
by
the
rays
of
two
which
flanked
a
gateway
the
footman
had
alighted
the
gate
was
thrown
open
the
carriage
passed
through
on
to
a
gravel
drive
her
nerves
strung
almost
beyond
endurance
and
even
now
seeking
courage
to
refuse
to
enter
the
house
alma
felt
the
vehicle
turn
on
a
sharp
curve
and
stop
shall
not
be
more
than
a
minute
said
strangeways
just
above
her
breath
as
though
she
spoke
with
effort
involuntarily
alma
laid
a
hand
on
her
arm
will
wait
for
you
here
please
dear
your
promise
oh
you
would
fail
me
the
carriage
door
had
opened
the
footman
stood
beside
it
scarce
knowing
what
she
did
alma
stepped
out
after
her
companion
and
in
the
same
moment
found
a
glow
of
light
poured
suddenly
about
her
it
came
from
the
of
a
house
where
a
female
servant
had
presented
herself
a
house
of
unusual
construction
with
pillars
and
a
veranda
nothing
more
was
observable
by
her
dazzled
and
confused
senses
mrs
strangeways
said
something
to
the
servant
they
entered
crossed
a
floor
of
smooth
tiles
under
electric
light
by
glass
shades
and
were
led
into
a
room
illumined
only
by
a
fire
until
the
servant
turned
on
a
soft
radiance
like
that
in
the
hall
strangeways
glanced
about
her
as
if
surprised
are
riot
expecting
mr
redgrave
she
said
quickly
madam
we
always
have
fires
against
the
damp
thereupon
the
woman
withdrew
closing
the
door
and
strangeways
who
was
very
pale
save
for
her
rouge
spots
said
in
a
low
tone
of
great
relief
began
to
fear
there
might
be
some
mistake
put
up
your
veil
for
a
moment
dear
and
glance
at
the
pictures
every
one
has
cost
a
small
fortune
oh
he
is
immensely
rich
and
knows
so
well
what
to
buy
chapter
alma
agitation
did
not
permit
her
to
examine
details
the
interior
of
redgrave
house
was
very
much
what
she
had
imagined
its
atmosphere
of
luxurious
refinement
its
colour
perfume
warmth
at
once
allured
and
alarmed
her
she
wished
to
indulge
her
senses
and
linger
till
she
had
seen
everything
she
wished
to
turn
at
once
and
escape
strangeways
meanwhile
seemed
to
be
looking
for
the
album
of
which
she
had
spoken
moving
hither
and
thither
with
a
frequent
pause
as
of
one
who
listens
or
a
glance
towards
the
door
wo
be
long
said
alma
turning
abruptly
to
her
my
silly
nervousness
dear
i
thought
i
remembered
perfectly
where
the
album
lay
how
foolish
of
me
i
quite
tremble
anyone
would
think
we
were
burglars
she
laughed
and
stood
looking
about
the
room
that
it
asked
alma
pointing
to
a
volume
on
a
table
near
her
no
i
not
sure
an
album
it
was
strangeways
unclasped
it
and
turned
over
a
few
pages
with
quivering
hand
i
thought
not
it
a
smaller
one
oh
what
a
good
photo
of
mrs
carnaby
have
you
seen
this
one
alma
stepped
forward
to
look
strangely
startled
by
the
name
of
her
friend
it
was
as
though
sibyl
herself
had
suddenly
entered
the
room
and
found
her
here
the
photograph
she
already
knew
but
its
eyes
seemed
to
regard
her
with
the
very
look
of
life
and
at
once
she
drew
back
find
the
right
one
strangeways
she
spoke
imploringly
must
be
what
bell
was
that
an
electric
bell
had
rung
within
the
house
it
still
trembled
in
her
ears
and
she
turned
sick
with
fright
strangeways
flushing
red
stammered
a
reassurance
here
is
the
right
one
in
a
minute
the
door
opened
as
she
saw
it
move
a
dreadful
certainty
of
what
was
about
to
happen
checked
alma
breath
and
a
sound
like
a
sob
escaped
her
then
she
was
looking
straight
into
the
eyes
of
cyrus
redgrave
he
wearing
an
ulster
and
with
a
in
his
hand
seemed
not
to
recognise
her
but
turned
his
look
upon
her
companion
and
spoke
with
mirthful
friendliness
i
have
caught
you
strangeways
police
oh
i
am
so
sorry
i
did
send
you
a
wire
i
thought
you
would
come
tomorrow
or
the
day
after
how
very
kind
of
you
to
take
this
trouble
immediately
i
had
to
run
over
at
a
moment
mrs
rolfe
forgive
me
for
the
moment
i
did
know
you
coming
out
of
the
darkness
so
glad
to
see
you
he
had
shaken
hands
with
both
of
them
behaving
as
though
presence
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
but
alma
strength
failed
her
she
trembled
towards
the
nearest
chair
and
sank
upon
it
strangeways
who
had
watched
her
with
anxiety
took
a
step
to
her
side
speaking
hurriedly
redgrave
i
took
the
liberty
to
use
your
house
as
if
it
were
my
own
rolfe
has
herself
she
has
been
playing
this
afternoon
at
a
concert
at
rayner
mann
we
were
to
drive
back
together
and
came
this
way
that
i
might
call
here
for
the
photo
but
rolfe
became
faint
after
her
exertions
redgrave
surpassed
himself
in
graceful
courtesy
how
could
mrs
strangeways
dream
of
offering
excuses
why
had
she
not
called
for
tea
or
anything
he
would
give
orders
at
once
and
the
ladies
would
permit
him
to
get
rid
of
his
travelling
attire
whilst
they
rested
he
was
turning
to
leave
the
room
when
alma
rose
and
commanded
her
voice
am
perfectly
well
again
thank
you
so
much
redgrave
indeed
i
must
stay
with
admirable
suavity
redgrave
overcame
her
desire
to
be
gone
pleading
he
passed
playfully
from
english
into
french
of
which
he
had
a
perfect
command
then
in
his
own
language
declared
that
french
alone
permitted
one
to
make
a
request
without
importunity
yet
with
adequate
fervour
alma
again
seated
herself
as
she
did
so
her
host
and
strangeways
exchanged
a
swift
glance
of
mutual
intelligence
can
i
hope
you
will
forgive
me
the
lady
murmured
at
alma
ear
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
very
annoying
and
there
nothing
more
to
be
said
was
the
cold
reply
it
is
of
the
least
importance
do
believe
me
we
are
such
old
friends
and
no
one
can
ever
know
though
it
would
matter
if
all
the
world
did
dare
say
not
but
please
let
our
stay
be
as
short
as
possible
will
go
dear
as
soon
as
ever
we
have
had
a
cup
of
tea
i
am
sorry
it
was
all
my
foolishness
the
tea
was
brought
and
strangeways
her
nervousness
having
quite
passed
away
began
to
talk
as
if
she
were
in
her
own
alma
too
had
recovered
control
of
herself
held
the
teacup
in
an
all
but
steady
hand
and
examined
the
room
at
her
leisure
after
ten
minutes
absence
redgrave
rejoined
them
now
in
ordinary
dress
his
face
warm
from
rapid
ablution
and
his
thin
hair
delicately
disposed
he
began
talking
in
a
bright
chatty
vein
so
rolfe
had
been
playing
at
a
concert
how
he
regretted
not
having
been
there
what
had
she
played
then
leaning
forward
with
an
air
of
kindness
that
verged
on
tenderness
am
sure
it
must
be
very
exhausting
to
the
nerves
you
have
so
undeniably
the
glow
the
fervour
of
a
true
artist
it
is
inspiring
to
watch
you
as
you
play
no
less
than
to
hear
you
you
do
feel
better
now
alma
replied
with
civility
but
did
not
meet
his
look
she
refused
another
cup
of
tea
and
glanced
so
meaningly
at
her
friend
that
in
a
few
moments
strangeways
rose
wo
leave
me
yet
to
my
solitude
exclaimed
redgrave
with
a
sigh
he
yielded
to
the
inevitable
inquired
gently
once
more
whether
rolfe
felt
quite
restored
and
again
overwhelmed
strangeways
with
thanks
still
the
ladies
had
to
wait
a
few
minutes
for
their
carriage
which
at
redgrave
direction
had
made
a
long
detour
in
the
adjacent
roads
and
during
this
delay
as
if
the
prospect
of
release
inspirited
her
alma
spoke
a
few
words
in
a
more
natural
tone
redgrave
had
asked
what
public
concerts
she
usually
attended
regularly
was
her
reply
should
often
go
on
saturdays
to
the
crystal
palace
if
it
were
not
so
far
for
me
i
want
to
get
there
if
possible
on
saturday
week
to
hear
sterndale
bennett
new
concerto
i
should
like
to
hear
that
said
redgrave
may
perhaps
see
each
other
this
time
she
did
not
refuse
to
encounter
his
look
and
the
smile
with
which
she
answered
it
was
so
peculiarly
expressive
of
a
disdain
that
he
could
scarcely
take
his
eyes
from
her
cyrus
redgrave
knew
as
well
as
most
men
the
signals
of
challenge
on
a
features
at
a
recent
meeting
he
had
detected
something
of
the
sort
in
alma
behaviour
to
him
and
at
this
moment
her
spirit
could
not
be
mistaken
quite
needlessly
she
had
told
him
where
he
might
find
her
if
he
chose
this
was
a
great
step
to
be
defied
so
daringly
meant
to
him
no
small
encouragement
fortunate
said
alma
as
the
carriage
bore
her
away
we
had
this
adventure
with
a
the
remark
sounded
surprising
to
strangeways
so
glad
you
have
quite
got
over
your
annoyance
dear
she
replied
was
as
bad
for
you
as
for
me
under
the
circumstances
but
i
sure
redgrave
wo
give
it
another
thought
and
alma
chatted
very
pleasantly
all
the
way
back
to
town
where
she
dined
with
strangeways
at
eleven
she
reached
home
her
husband
who
was
recovering
from
a
sore
throat
sat
pipeless
and
in
no
very
cheerful
mood
by
the
library
fire
but
the
sight
of
alma
radiant
countenance
had
its
wonted
effect
upon
him
he
stretched
his
arms
as
if
to
rouse
himself
from
a
long
fit
of
reverie
and
welcomed
her
in
a
voice
that
was
a
little
husky
how
did
it
go
badly
i
think
and
how
have
you
been
getting
on
poor
old
boy
so
swearing
a
little
because
i
could
smoke
but
hughie
has
a
cold
tonight
caught
mine
i
dare
say
confound
it
miss
smith
took
counsel
with
me
about
it
and
we
doctored
him
a
little
dear
little
man
i
wish
i
had
been
back
in
time
to
see
him
but
there
was
no
getting
away
had
to
stay
to
dinner
alma
had
not
the
habit
of
telling
falsehoods
to
her
husband
but
she
did
it
remarkably
well
even
better
perhaps
than
when
she
deceived
her
german
friend
fraulein
steinfeld
in
the
matter
of
cyrus
redgrave
proposal
the
years
had
matured
her
endowing
her
with
superior
and
a
finish
of
style
in
dealing
with
these
little
difficulties
she
was
unwilling
to
say
that
she
had
dined
in
porchester
terrace
for
harvey
entertained
something
of
a
prejudice
against
that
household
his
remoteness
nowadays
from
the
world
in
which
alma
amused
herself
made
it
quite
safe
to
venture
on
a
trifling
misstatement
have
a
note
from
carnaby
said
rolfe
wants
to
see
me
in
town
tomorrow
says
he
has
good
news
devilish
good
news
to
be
accurate
i
wonder
what
it
is
lawsuit
won
perhaps
not
that
take
a
few
more
years
odd
thing
i
have
another
letter
from
cecil
morphew
and
he
too
says
that
he
has
something
hopeful
to
tell
me
about
alma
clapped
her
hands
an
unusual
expression
of
joy
for
her
are
cheering
up
all
round
she
exclaimed
if
only
could
light
on
something
fortunate
he
gave
her
a
quick
look
do
you
mean
by
that
that
you
have
seemed
in
very
good
spirits
lately
as
usual
i
many
people
at
putney
a
hundred
and
twenty
compliments
showered
on
me
i
do
so
wish
you
could
have
heard
them
somebody
told
me
that
some
man
asked
her
how
it
was
he
did
know
my
name
he
took
me
for
a
professional
violinist
no
doubt
you
are
as
good
as
many
of
them
really
think
that
said
alma
pulling
her
chair
a
little
nearer
to
the
fire
and
looking
eagerly
at
him
should
you
be
you
have
the
same
opportunities
and
make
all
possible
use
of
them
alma
was
silent
for
a
few
ticks
of
the
clock
once
and
a
second
time
she
stole
a
glance
at
harvey
face
then
grasping
with
each
hand
the
arms
of
her
chair
and
seeming
to
string
herself
for
an
effort
she
spoke
in
a
tone
should
you
say
if
i
proposed
to
come
out
to
a
professional
harvey
eyes
turned
slowly
upon
her
he
read
her
face
with
curiosity
and
did
not
smile
you
mean
you
have
thought
of
it
tell
you
the
truth
it
is
so
often
put
into
my
head
by
other
people
i
am
constantly
being
asked
why
i
content
to
remain
an
amateur
professional
musicians
sorts
of
people
reminds
me
of
something
you
know
i
do
interfere
i
pretend
to
have
you
in
surveillance
and
do
wish
to
begin
it
but
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
are
making
friends
in
the
best
class
that
is
open
to
you
alma
smile
died
away
for
a
moment
she
recovered
the
face
of
years
gone
by
a
look
which
put
harvey
in
mind
of
frothingham
little
at
swiss
cottage
where
more
than
once
alma
had
gazed
at
him
with
a
lofty
coldness
which
concealed
resentment
that
expression
could
still
make
him
shrink
a
little
and
feel
uncomfortable
but
it
quickly
faded
giving
place
to
a
look
of
perfectly
amiable
protest
dear
harvey
what
has
caused
you
to
doubt
it
merely
asked
the
question
perhaps
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
were
not
exactly
in
your
place
among
people
who
talk
to
you
in
that
way
must
allow
for
my
exaggeration
said
alma
softly
or
two
have
said
it
just
people
who
know
most
about
music
and
there
a
of
putting
things
carnaby
there
today
do
see
her
very
often
now
not
so
often
i
suppose
the
reason
is
that
i
am
more
drawn
to
the
people
who
care
about
music
sibyl
really
musical
though
of
course
i
like
her
as
much
as
ever
then
the
truth
is
she
seems
to
have
grown
rather
extravagant
and
i
simply
understand
how
she
can
keep
up
such
a
life
if
it
true
that
her
husband
is
only
losing
money
last
time
i
was
with
her
i
could
help
thinking
that
she
ought
to
to
deny
herself
rather
more
it
habit
i
suppose
harvey
nodded
twice
thrice
and
kept
a
grave
countenance
you
do
care
to
see
much
of
mrs
abbott
he
rather
let
fall
than
spoke
you
know
dear
i
do
mean
to
be
at
all
disagreeable
but
we
have
so
little
in
common
is
it
so
i
am
sure
abbott
anxious
for
my
society
again
rolfe
sat
silent
and
again
alma
stole
glances
at
him
i
tell
you
something
i
have
in
mind
he
said
at
length
with
deliberation
you
know
is
three
years
old
pauline
does
very
well
with
him
but
it
is
time
that
he
had
companions
other
children
in
half
a
year
or
so
he
might
go
to
a
kindergarten
and
he
made
an
instant
pause
know
only
of
one
which
would
be
really
good
for
him
i
think
he
will
have
to
go
to
mrs
abbott
their
eyes
met
and
the
speaker
were
steadily
fixed
the
distance
objected
alma
if
we
want
to
do
that
we
must
go
to
gunnersbury
alma
look
fell
she
tapped
with
her
foot
and
meditated
slightly
frowning
but
before
harvey
spoke
again
the
muscles
of
her
face
relaxed
and
she
turned
to
him
with
a
smile
as
though
some
reflection
had
brought
relief
would
mind
the
bother
of
moving
is
that
compared
with
hughie
advantage
and
if
one
lives
in
london
it
in
the
nature
of
things
to
change
houses
once
a
year
or
so
we
do
live
in
london
returned
alma
with
a
laugh
the
same
thing
at
gunnersbury
you
would
be
nearer
to
everything
you
know
you
would
send
away
pauline
harvey
made
a
restless
movement
and
gave
a
husky
cough
i
do
know
you
see
hughie
would
be
with
abbott
only
a
few
hours
each
day
who
is
to
look
after
the
little
man
at
other
times
i
suppose
i
ca
very
well
undertake
it
myself
though
i
glad
to
see
as
much
of
him
as
possible
and
i
wo
let
him
be
with
a
servant
so
alma
was
gazing
at
the
fire
and
seemed
to
give
only
a
divided
attention
to
what
her
husband
said
her
eyes
grew
wide
their
vision
certainly
was
of
nothing
that
disturbed
or
disheartened
her
have
given
me
two
things
to
think
about
harvey
will
you
reflect
on
the
that
i
suggested
you
meant
it
seriously
meant
that
i
should
like
to
have
your
serious
opinion
about
it
only
we
wo
talk
now
i
am
very
tired
and
you
i
sure
ought
to
sit
late
with
your
bad
throat
i
promise
to
consider
the
things
you
mentioned
she
held
her
hands
to
him
charmingly
and
kissed
his
cheek
as
she
said
goodnight
harvey
lingered
for
another
hour
and
of
all
people
in
the
world
somehow
found
himself
thinking
of
buncombe
buncombe
his
landlord
in
the
big
dirty
house
by
royal
oak
what
had
become
of
buncombe
it
would
be
amusing
some
day
to
look
at
the
old
house
and
see
if
buncombe
still
lived
there
chapter
they
never
talked
about
money
alma
took
it
for
granted
that
harvey
would
not
allow
their
expenditure
to
outrun
his
income
and
therewith
kept
her
mind
at
rest
rolfe
had
not
thought
it
necessary
to
mention
that
he
derived
about
three
hundred
pounds
from
debenture
stock
which
was
redeemable
and
that
the
date
of
redemption
fell
early
in
this
present
year
he
himself
had
all
along
scarcely
regarded
the
matter
when
the
stock
became
his
seemed
very
remote
and
on
settling
in
north
wales
he
felt
financially
so
secure
that
the
question
of
reinvestment
might
well
be
left
for
consideration
till
it
was
pressed
upon
him
as
now
it
was
he
could
no
longer
disregard
percentages
he
wanted
every
penny
that
his
capital
would
yield
before
marriage
he
would
have
paid
little
heed
to
the
fact
that
his
canal
shares
an
investment
which
he
had
looked
upon
as
part
of
the
eternal
order
of
things
showed
an
inclination
to
lose
slightly
in
value
now
it
troubled
him
day
and
night
as
for
the
debenture
stock
he
might
if
he
chose
it
without
withdrawal
but
that
meant
a
lower
dividend
which
was
hardly
to
be
thought
of
whither
should
he
turn
for
a
security
at
once
sound
and
remunerative
he
began
to
read
the
money
article
in
his
daily
paper
which
hitherto
he
had
passed
over
as
if
it
did
not
exist
or
turned
from
with
contemptuous
impatience
he
picked
up
financial
newspapers
at
railway
bookstalls
and
in
private
struggled
to
comprehend
their
jargon
taking
care
that
they
never
fell
under
his
wife
eyes
at
the
metropolitan
club
of
which
he
had
resumed
membership
after
thinking
that
he
would
never
again
enter
clubland
he
talked
with
men
who
were
at
home
in
city
matters
and
indirectly
tried
to
get
hints
from
them
he
felt
like
one
who
meddles
with
something
forbidden
who
pries
shamefaced
into
the
secrets
of
an
odious
vice
to
study
the
gave
him
a
headache
he
had
to
go
for
a
country
walk
to
bathe
and
change
his
clothes
before
he
was
at
ease
again
two
only
of
his
intimates
had
any
practical
acquaintance
with
methods
of
speculation
and
their
experiences
hitherto
were
not
such
as
to
suggest
his
seeking
advice
from
them
hugh
carnaby
might
or
might
not
reap
profit
from
his
cycle
factory
as
yet
it
had
given
him
nothing
but
worry
and
wavering
hopes
cecil
morphew
had
somehow
got
into
better
circumstances
had
repaid
the
loan
of
fifty
pounds
and
professed
to
know
much
more
about
speculation
than
in
the
days
when
he
made
money
only
to
lose
it
again
but
it
was
to
be
feared
that
cecil
associated
with
people
of
shady
character
and
might
at
any
moment
come
to
grief
in
a
more
or
less
squalid
way
he
confessed
that
there
was
a
mystery
in
his
life
something
he
preferred
not
to
speak
of
even
with
an
old
friend
oddly
enough
carnaby
and
morphew
wrote
both
at
the
same
time
wishing
to
see
him
and
saying
that
they
had
cheering
news
to
impart
amid
his
perplexities
which
were
not
concerned
with
money
alone
harvey
welcomed
this
opportunity
of
forgetting
himself
for
a
few
hours
he
agreed
to
lunch
with
hugh
at
a
restaurant
carnaby
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
clubs
and
bade
morphew
to
dinner
at
the
metropolitan
it
was
a
day
of
drizzle
and
slush
but
harvey
had
got
over
his
sore
throat
and
in
ordinary
health
defied
the
elements
unlike
himself
carnaby
came
a
little
late
for
his
appointment
and
pleaded
business
with
a
in
the
city
rheums
and
bronchial
disorders
were
to
him
unknown
he
had
never
possessed
an
umbrella
and
only
on
days
like
this
donned
a
light
overcoat
to
guard
himself
against
what
he
called
sooty
spittle
of
a
london
sky
yet
he
was
not
the
man
of
four
or
five
years
ago
he
had
the
same
appearance
of
muscularity
the
same
red
neck
and
mighty
fists
but
beneath
his
eyes
hung
baggy
flesh
that
gave
him
a
bilious
aspect
his
cheeks
were
a
little
sunken
and
the
tone
of
his
complexion
had
lost
its
healthy
clearness
in
temper
too
he
had
suffered
perhaps
in
manners
he
used
oaths
too
freely
intermingled
his
good
bluff
english
the
english
of
a
country
gentleman
with
recent
slang
tended
to
the
rather
than
to
the
unconsciously
breezy
and
bold
us
find
a
corner
he
said
clutching
his
friend
by
the
shoulder
of
the
damned
crowd
finished
asked
harvey
when
they
had
found
a
place
and
ordered
their
meal
hugh
answered
with
a
deep
rolling
curse
when
he
returned
to
england
in
the
summer
of
he
entered
at
once
into
partnership
with
the
man
mackintosh
taking
over
an
established
business
at
coventry
with
which
his
partner
already
had
some
connection
not
a
week
passed
before
they
found
themselves
at
law
with
regard
to
a
bicycle
brake
a
patent
they
had
begun
by
purchasing
only
to
find
their
right
in
it
immediately
contested
the
case
came
on
in
november
it
occupied
nine
days
and
was
adjourned
not
until
july
of
the
following
year
was
judgment
delivered
it
went
for
mackintosh
co
the
plaintiffs
whose
claim
the
judge
held
to
be
proved
but
this
by
no
means
terminated
the
litigation
the
defendants
who
had
all
along
persisted
in
manufacturing
and
selling
this
patent
brake
now
obtained
stay
of
injunction
until
the
beginning
of
the
michaelmas
term
with
the
understanding
that
if
notice
of
appeal
were
given
before
then
the
injunction
would
be
stayed
until
the
appeal
was
settled
and
notice
given
and
the
appeal
would
doubtless
be
heard
some
day
or
other
but
meanwhile
the
year
had
come
round
and
mackintosh
saw
their
rivals
manufacturing
and
selling
as
gaily
as
ever
hugh
carnaby
grew
red
in
the
face
as
he
spoke
of
them
his
clenched
fist
lay
on
the
tablecloth
and
it
was
pretty
clear
how
he
longed
to
expedite
the
course
of
justice
still
he
had
good
news
to
communicate
and
he
began
by
asking
whether
harvey
saw
much
of
redgrave
echoed
the
other
in
surprise
i
hardly
know
him
your
wife
knows
him
very
well
i
dare
say
she
does
carnaby
did
not
observe
his
friend
countenance
he
was
eating
with
great
appetite
is
at
all
a
bad
fellow
i
did
know
him
much
till
lately
used
to
see
him
at
you
know
and
one
or
two
other
places
where
i
went
with
sibyl
thought
him
rather
a
snob
but
i
was
quite
mistaken
he
a
very
nice
fellow
when
you
get
near
to
him
harvey
surprise
was
increased
for
his
own
part
he
still
thought
of
redgrave
with
the
old
prejudice
though
he
had
no
definite
charge
to
bring
against
the
man
he
would
have
supposed
him
the
last
person
either
to
seek
or
to
obtain
favour
with
hugh
carnaby
has
known
him
for
a
long
time
hugh
continued
me
he
did
all
sorts
of
kindnesses
for
her
mother
at
ascott
larkfield
death
fixed
up
her
affairs
they
were
in
a
devil
of
a
state
i
believe
last
autumn
we
met
him
in
scotland
he
was
with
his
sister
and
her
family
fenimore
her
husband
in
india
and
he
seems
to
look
after
her
in
a
way
that
does
him
credit
in
fact
i
saw
a
new
side
of
the
fellow
we
got
quite
chummy
and
i
happened
to
speak
about
mackintosh
well
now
what
do
you
think
two
days
ago
at
coventry
i
got
a
note
from
him
he
was
coming
through
and
would
like
to
see
me
would
i
lunch
with
him
at
a
hotel
i
did
and
he
surprised
me
by
beginning
to
talk
about
business
the
fact
was
he
had
some
money
lying
loose
wanted
to
place
it
somewhere
and
had
faith
in
cycles
why
should
he
make
an
offer
to
a
friend
would
mackintosh
care
to
admit
a
new
partner
or
anyhow
could
we
make
use
of
a
few
thousand
pounds
rolfe
had
ceased
to
eat
and
was
listening
intently
the
story
sounded
very
strange
to
him
it
did
not
fit
at
all
with
his
conception
of
cyrus
redgrave
suppose
a
few
thousands
would
come
very
handy
he
remarked
old
man
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
can
do
it
now
for
me
it
means
a
jump
out
of
a
particularly
black
hole
you
must
understand
that
we
not
doing
downright
badly
we
pay
our
way
but
that
was
about
all
i
individually
should
have
paid
my
way
for
many
months
longer
god
how
i
clutched
at
it
you
do
know
what
it
is
rolfe
to
see
your
damned
account
at
the
bank
slithering
away
and
not
a
cent
to
pay
in
i
thought
of
all
sorts
of
things
just
stopping
short
of
burglary
and
i
should
have
stopped
at
that
long
mean
that
this
new
capital
will
give
such
a
push
to
the
business
course
it
was
just
what
we
wanted
we
could
advertise
buy
a
new
patent
could
move
at
all
now
we
shall
make
things
hum
redgrave
become
a
partner
then
sleeping
partner
but
redgrave
is
wide
enough
awake
mackintosh
says
he
never
met
a
keener
man
of
business
you
would
have
thought
it
would
you
i
should
fancy
he
manages
all
his
own
property
and
does
it
devilish
well
too
of
course
he
has
all
sorts
of
ways
of
helping
us
on
he
got
ideas
of
his
own
too
about
the
machines
i
wonder
if
he
hits
on
something
valuable
i
never
half
understood
him
before
he
does
shoot
much
but
knows
enough
about
it
to
make
pleasant
talk
and
he
has
travelled
a
good
deal
then
of
course
he
goes
in
for
art
music
all
that
sort
of
thing
there
really
no
humbug
about
him
he
neither
prig
nor
cad
though
i
used
to
think
him
a
little
of
both
harvey
reflected
revived
his
mental
image
of
the
capitalist
and
still
found
it
very
unlike
the
picture
suggested
by
hugh
redgrave
he
asked
did
he
get
his
money
know
nothing
about
that
i
do
think
he
a
university
man
he
hinted
once
that
he
was
educated
abroad
seems
to
know
plenty
of
good
people
fenimore
his
sister
lives
at
wimbledon
sibyl
and
i
were
over
there
not
long
ago
dining
one
or
two
titled
people
a
parson
and
so
on
devilish
respectable
but
dull
the
kind
of
company
that
makes
me
want
to
stand
up
and
yell
redgrave
has
built
himself
what
he
calls
a
bungalow
somewhere
near
the
house
but
i
did
see
it
a
good
deal
at
coventry
asked
rolfe
and
on
just
been
down
for
ten
days
if
it
were
possible
i
should
go
steadily
at
the
business
i
used
to
think
i
could
fit
into
work
of
that
sort
but
a
man
never
knows
what
he
can
do
till
he
tries
i
ca
stand
doing
nothing
that
floors
me
i
smoke
too
much
and
drink
too
much
and
get
quarrelsome
and
wish
i
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
but
it
out
of
the
question
to
live
down
yonder
i
could
ask
sibyl
to
do
it
you
leave
her
quite
alone
then
carnaby
made
an
uneasy
movement
has
been
visiting
here
and
there
for
the
last
month
now
her
mother
wants
her
to
go
to
ventnor
much
better
she
should
they
hate
each
other
ca
be
together
a
day
without
quarrelling
pretty
plain
on
which
side
the
fault
lies
i
should
think
there
are
many
women
better
tempered
than
sibyl
all
the
time
we
been
married
and
all
we
gone
through
i
have
never
once
seen
an
unpleasant
look
on
her
face
to
that
is
it
something
to
be
able
to
say
that
larkfield
is
simply
intolerable
she
always
either
whining
or
in
a
fury
ca
talk
of
anything
but
the
loss
of
her
money
reminds
me
interposed
harvey
you
know
that
there
seems
to
be
a
chance
of
getting
something
out
of
the
great
wreck
who
says
so
frothingham
the
creditors
come
first
of
course
was
your
wife
creditor
or
shareholder
both
she
may
hear
something
before
long
i
do
pretend
to
understand
the
beastly
affair
but
frothingham
wrote
to
us
about
it
the
day
before
yesterday
with
hints
of
eighteenpence
in
the
pound
which
she
seemed
to
think
very
glorious
carnaby
growled
in
disgust
be
damned
well
perhaps
it
buy
her
a
hat
i
tell
you
rolfe
when
i
compare
sibyl
with
her
mother
i
almost
feel
too
good
for
the
world
suppose
she
had
turned
out
sort
of
woman
what
would
have
been
the
end
of
it
murder
most
likely
but
she
bore
the
loss
of
all
her
money
just
as
she
did
the
loss
of
her
jewellery
and
things
when
our
house
was
burgled
never
turned
a
hair
there
a
girl
to
be
proud
of
i
tell
you
he
insisted
upon
it
so
vehemently
that
one
might
have
imagined
him
in
conflict
with
secret
doubts
as
to
his
wife
perfection
a
very
strange
thing
said
rolfe
looking
at
his
wine
those
thieves
got
clean
away
not
a
single
thing
they
stole
ever
tracked
there
ca
be
many
such
cases
have
a
theory
about
that
hugh
his
eyes
looking
at
once
shrewd
and
fierce
woman
herself
the
housekeeper
is
at
this
moment
going
about
in
society
somewhere
she
was
no
whitechapel
thief
there
a
gang
organised
among
the
people
we
live
with
if
i
go
out
to
dine
as
likely
as
not
i
sit
next
to
a
burglar
or
a
forger
or
anything
you
like
the
police
never
get
on
the
scent
and
it
the
same
in
many
another
robbery
some
day
perhaps
there
be
an
astounding
disclosure
a
blazing
hell
of
a
scandal
a
dozen
men
and
women
marched
from
belgravia
and
mayfair
to
newgate
i
sure
of
it
what
else
can
you
expect
of
such
a
civilisation
as
ours
well
i
should
know
that
woman
again
and
if
ever
i
find
myself
taking
her
down
to
dinner
harvey
exploded
in
laughter
tell
you
i
quite
serious
said
the
other
angrily
that
the
explanation
of
it
there
are
plenty
of
good
and
honest
people
still
but
they
ca
help
getting
mixed
up
among
the
vilest
lot
on
the
face
of
the
earth
that
why
i
do
like
my
wife
to
make
new
acquaintances
wo
get
any
harm
but
i
hate
to
think
of
the
people
she
perhaps
meets
mackintosh
was
telling
me
of
a
woman
in
london
who
keeps
up
a
big
house
and
entertains
all
sorts
of
people
and
her
husband
knows
where
the
money
comes
from
he
would
mention
her
name
because
by
jove
he
had
himself
contributed
to
the
expenses
of
the
establishment
it
was
three
or
four
years
ago
when
he
had
his
money
and
ran
through
it
for
all
i
know
sibyl
may
go
there
i
tell
her
about
such
things
and
she
would
believe
me
if
i
did
an
idealist
sees
everything
through
poetry
and
philosophy
i
should
be
a
brute
if
i
soiled
her
mind
and
i
say
old
man
why
do
your
wife
and
she
see
more
of
each
other
is
it
just
the
distance
afraid
that
has
something
to
do
with
it
harvey
replied
trying
to
speak
naturally
sorry
they
both
of
them
too
good
for
ordinary
society
i
wish
to
god
we
could
all
four
of
us
go
out
to
a
place
i
know
in
tasmania
and
live
honest
clean
rational
lives
ca
be
managed
your
wife
has
her
music
sibyl
has
her
books
and
so
on
you
know
mrs
strangeways
know
her
not
much
good
particular
harm
sibyl
saw
a
little
of
her
but
i
do
think
they
meet
now
your
wife
know
her
has
met
her
here
and
there
you
and
i
are
alike
in
that
we
ca
stand
the
so
our
wives
have
to
go
about
by
themselves
the
days
are
past
when
a
man
watched
over
his
wife
coming
and
going
as
a
matter
of
course
we
should
only
make
fools
of
ourselves
if
we
tried
it
on
it
the
new
world
my
boy
we
live
in
it
and
must
make
the
best
of
it
hugh
carnaby
drank
more
wine
than
is
usually
taken
at
luncheon
it
excited
him
to
boisterous
condemnation
of
things
in
general
he
complained
of
the
idleness
that
was
forced
upon
him
except
when
he
could
get
down
to
coventry
hang
about
for
whole
days
doing
literally
nothing
what
i
do
i
not
the
man
for
books
i
ca
get
much
sport
nowadays
i
care
for
billiards
i
want
to
have
an
axe
in
my
hand
gesticulating
carelessly
he
swept
a
off
the
table
damn
it
shows
we
sat
long
enough
come
and
talk
to
sibyl
and
let
her
give
you
a
cup
of
tea
you
never
see
her
never
yet
she
thinks
better
of
you
than
of
any
other
man
we
know
come
let
get
out
of
this
beastly
air
the
place
reeks
of
onions
they
went
to
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
where
rolfe
spent
the
time
until
he
had
to
leave
for
his
appointment
with
cecil
morphew
sibyl
was
very
kind
but
gently
reproachful
why
had
alma
forsaken
her
why
did
harvey
himself
never
drop
in
often
quite
lonely
rolfe
and
as
one
result
of
it
i
getting
learned
look
at
these
books
wo
you
give
me
a
word
of
admiration
there
was
a
volume
of
crowe
and
cavalcaselle
one
of
benvenuto
in
the
original
ca
help
clinging
to
the
old
world
she
said
sweetly
forgives
me
like
a
good
boy
and
you
i
know
not
only
forgive
but
sympathise
of
course
not
a
word
passed
with
reference
to
hugh
carnaby
business
redgrave
name
was
not
mentioned
sibyl
one
felt
would
decline
to
recognise
in
her
own
the
gross
necessities
of
life
had
bankruptcy
been
impending
she
would
have
ignored
it
with
the
same
perfection
of
repose
an
inscrutable
woman
who
could
look
and
smile
at
one
without
conveying
the
faintest
suggestion
of
her
actual
thoughts
on
his
way
to
the
club
harvey
puzzled
over
what
seemed
to
him
redgrave
singular
behaviour
why
should
a
man
in
that
position
volunteer
pecuniary
aid
to
an
obscure
and
struggling
firm
could
it
be
genuine
friendship
for
hugh
carnaby
that
sounded
most
improbable
perhaps
redgrave
like
the
majority
of
people
in
his
world
appeared
much
wealthier
than
he
really
was
and
saw
in
mackintosh
business
a
reasonable
hope
of
profit
in
that
case
and
if
the
concern
began
to
flourish
might
not
an
older
friend
of
carnaby
find
lucrative
employment
for
his
capital
he
had
always
thought
with
uttermost
contempt
of
the
man
who
allows
himself
to
be
gripped
worried
dragged
down
by
artificial
necessities
was
he
himself
to
become
a
victim
of
this
social
disease
was
he
resistless
to
be
drawn
into
the
muddy
whirlpool
to
spin
round
and
round
among
gibbering
phantoms
abandoning
himself
with
a
grin
of
inane
conceit
or
clutching
in
desperation
at
futile
hopes
he
remembered
his
tranquil
life
between
the
mountains
and
the
sea
his
earlier
freedom
wandering
in
the
sunlight
of
silent
lands
surely
there
needed
but
a
little
a
little
decision
to
save
himself
from
this
rushing
current
one
word
to
alma
would
it
not
suffice
but
of
all
things
he
dreaded
to
incur
the
charge
of
meanness
of
selfishness
that
had
ever
been
his
weak
point
in
youth
a
cause
of
ruin
in
later
life
impelling
him
to
numberless
insincerities
and
follies
however
the
danger
as
yet
only
threatened
he
was
solvent
he
had
still
a
reserve
it
behoved
him
merely
to
avoid
the
risks
of
speculation
and
to
check
in
natural
unobtrusive
ways
that
tendency
to
extravagance
of
living
which
was
nowadays
universal
could
he
not
depend
upon
himself
for
this
moderate
manliness
cecil
morphew
though
differing
in
all
other
respects
from
hugh
carnaby
showed
a
face
which
like
hugh
was
growing
prematurely
old
a
fatigued
complexion
sunken
eyes
an
expression
mingled
of
discontent
and
eagerness
now
furtive
now
sanguine
yet
losing
the
worse
traits
in
a
still
youthful
smile
as
he
came
forward
to
meet
his
friend
year
after
year
he
clung
to
the
old
amorous
hope
but
he
no
longer
spoke
of
it
with
the
same
impulsive
frankness
he
did
not
shun
the
subject
brought
it
indeed
voluntarily
forward
but
with
a
shamefaced
hesitance
his
declaration
in
a
letter
not
long
ago
that
he
was
unworthy
of
any
good
woman
love
pointed
to
something
which
had
had
its
share
in
the
obvious
smirching
of
his
character
something
common
enough
no
doubt
easily
divined
by
harvey
rolfe
though
he
could
not
learn
how
far
the
man
future
was
compromised
today
morphew
began
with
talk
of
a
hopeful
tenor
he
had
got
hold
of
a
little
money
he
had
conceived
a
project
for
making
more
when
the
progress
of
their
eating
and
drinking
cleared
the
way
for
confidential
disclosures
morphew
began
to
hint
at
his
scheme
heard
me
speak
of
denbow
this
was
a
man
who
had
given
him
lessons
in
photography
a
dealer
in
photographic
apparatus
with
a
shop
in
westminster
bridge
road
a
very
decent
fellow
but
it
all
up
with
him
his
wife
drinks
and
he
has
lost
money
in
betting
and
now
he
wants
to
clear
out
to
sell
his
business
and
get
away
he
came
to
me
to
apologise
for
spoiling
some
negatives
he
does
a
little
printing
for
me
now
and
then
and
told
me
what
he
meant
to
do
did
i
know
of
anyone
likely
to
take
his
shop
harvey
laughed
in
with
a
queer
lot
of
people
it
seems
to
me
denbow
is
all
but
a
gentleman
i
assure
you
he
was
educated
at
charterhouse
but
made
a
fool
of
himself
i
believe
in
the
common
way
but
about
his
business
i
seen
a
good
deal
of
it
going
in
and
out
and
talking
with
them
and
i
know
as
much
about
photography
as
most
amateurs
you
admit
that
rolfe
it
was
true
that
he
had
attained
more
than
ordinary
skill
with
the
camera
indeed
but
for
this
resource
happily
discovered
in
the
days
of
his
hopelessness
he
would
probably
have
sunk
out
of
sight
before
now
salesman
is
a
thoroughly
honest
and
capable
fellow
hobcraft
his
name
he
been
at
the
shop
three
or
four
years
and
would
be
only
too
glad
to
carry
on
the
business
but
he
ca
raise
money
and
denbow
must
have
cash
down
now
the
fact
is
i
want
to
buy
that
business
myself
see
what
does
the
man
ask
for
it
morphew
fidgeted
a
little
just
at
present
there
is
much
stock
nothing
like
what
there
ought
to
be
denbow
has
been
coming
down
the
hill
he
stopped
himself
only
just
in
time
when
i
first
knew
him
he
was
doing
reasonably
well
it
a
good
position
for
that
kind
of
shop
swarms
of
men
you
know
go
backwards
and
forwards
along
the
westminster
bridge
road
and
just
the
kind
of
men
lots
of
them
that
take
up
photography
the
better
kind
of
clerk
and
the
man
of
business
who
lives
in
the
south
suburbs
and
photography
is
going
ahead
so
i
have
all
sorts
of
ideas
one
might
push
the
printing
branch
of
the
business
and
have
dark
rooms
for
amateurs
and
hit
on
a
new
and
perhaps
even
start
a
paper
call
it
or
something
of
that
kind
do
smile
and
look
sceptical
at
all
it
seems
to
me
the
best
suggestion
i
heard
from
you
yet
so
i
awfully
glad
of
that
you
know
rolfe
a
fellow
like
myself
decent
family
public
school
and
that
kind
of
thing
naturally
fights
shy
of
shopkeeping
but
i
got
to
the
point
that
i
do
care
what
i
do
if
only
it
bring
me
a
steady
income
in
an
honest
way
i
ought
to
be
able
to
make
several
hundreds
a
year
even
at
starting
out
of
that
business
you
spoken
of
it
in
the
usual
quarter
i
have
cecil
countenance
fell
should
if
i
made
a
successful
start
but
i
talked
of
so
many
things
i
ashamed
and
she
might
quite
understand
perhaps
she
would
think
i
was
going
down
down
is
her
father
better
nor
worse
that
man
will
take
another
ten
years
over
his
dying
see
if
he
does
well
we
got
used
to
it
we
neither
of
us
young
any
longer
we
lost
the
best
part
of
our
lives
and
all
for
what
because
we
had
money
enough
to
take
a
house
three
times
bigger
than
we
needed
two
lives
wasted
because
we
could
feed
fifty
other
people
for
whom
we
did
care
a
damn
does
it
come
to
that
doubt
what
does
denbow
ask
the
stock
two
hundred
pounds
fifty
business
as
it
stands
say
three
hundred
the
rent
is
floor
above
the
shop
let
to
a
family
who
pay
shillings
a
week
a
substantial
against
the
rent
but
i
should
like
to
get
rid
of
the
people
and
use
the
whole
house
for
business
purposes
three
years
of
denbow
lease
to
run
but
this
he
says
the
landlord
would
be
willing
to
convert
into
a
seven
years
lease
to
a
new
tenant
then
one
must
allow
something
for
repairs
and
so
on
at
the
fresh
start
well
with
purchase
of
a
little
new
stock
say
another
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
roughly
speaking
i
ought
to
have
about
five
hundred
pounds
to
settle
the
affair
you
have
the
money
quite
i
got
well
i
may
say
three
hundred
i
not
speaking
of
my
own
private
income
of
course
that
goes
on
as
usual
and
is
a
penny
too
much
for
for
ordinary
he
fidgeted
again
you
care
to
know
how
i
made
this
bit
of
capital
you
care
to
tell
me
i
will
just
to
show
you
what
one
is
driven
to
do
two
years
ago
i
was
ill
congestion
of
the
lungs
felt
sure
i
should
die
you
were
in
wales
then
i
sent
for
tripcony
to
get
him
to
make
my
will
he
used
to
be
a
solicitor
you
know
before
he
started
the
when
i
pulled
through
trip
came
one
day
and
said
he
had
a
job
for
me
be
careful
not
to
mention
this
the
job
was
to
get
the
city
editor
of
a
certain
newspaper
a
man
i
know
very
well
to
print
a
damaging
rumour
about
a
certain
company
you
wonder
how
i
could
manage
this
well
simply
because
the
son
of
the
chairman
of
that
company
was
a
sort
of
friend
of
mine
and
the
city
editor
knew
it
if
i
could
get
the
paragraph
inserted
tripcony
would
not
pay
me
anything
but
give
me
a
tip
to
buy
certain
stock
which
he
guaranteed
would
be
rising
well
i
undertook
the
job
and
i
succeeded
and
trip
was
as
good
as
his
word
i
bought
as
much
as
i
dared
through
trip
mind
you
and
he
would
let
me
of
the
cover
which
i
thought
suspicious
though
it
was
only
habit
of
business
i
bought
at
and
on
settling
day
the
quotation
was
par
i
wanted
to
go
at
it
again
but
trip
shook
his
head
well
i
netted
nearly
five
hundred
the
most
caddish
affair
i
ever
was
in
but
i
wanted
money
stop
that
only
half
the
story
just
at
that
time
i
met
a
man
who
wanted
to
start
a
proprietary
club
he
had
the
lease
of
a
house
near
golden
square
but
not
quite
money
enough
to
furnish
it
properly
and
set
the
club
going
well
i
joined
him
and
put
in
four
hundred
pounds
and
for
a
year
and
a
half
we
did
do
badly
then
there
was
a
smash
the
police
raided
the
place
one
night
and
my
partner
went
before
the
magistrates
i
trembled
in
my
shoes
but
my
name
was
never
mentioned
it
only
ended
in
a
fine
and
of
course
i
went
halves
then
we
sold
the
club
for
two
hundred
furniture
and
all
and
i
found
myself
with
what
i
have
now
not
quite
three
hundred
boy
you
been
going
it
remarked
rolfe
with
a
clouded
brow
what
i
tell
you
i
want
to
get
out
of
all
that
kind
of
thing
now
how
am
i
to
get
two
or
three
hundred
honestly
i
think
denbow
would
take
less
than
he
says
for
cash
down
but
the
stock
i
guarantee
is
worth
two
hundred
have
the
first
offer
day
after
tomorrow
monday
sunday
that
awkward
never
mind
if
i
come
over
in
the
morning
will
you
take
me
to
the
place
and
let
me
look
over
it
with
you
and
see
both
denbow
and
the
shopman
course
i
will
said
morphew
delightedly
all
aboveboard
there
a
devilish
good
business
to
be
made
it
depends
only
on
the
man
why
denbow
has
made
as
much
as
two
hundred
in
a
year
out
of
printing
for
amateurs
alone
it
his
own
fault
that
he
did
keep
it
up
i
swear
rolfe
that
with
capital
and
hard
work
and
acuteness
that
place
can
be
made
establishment
of
the
kind
south
of
the
thames
why
there
no
reason
why
one
should
net
a
thousand
a
year
in
a
very
short
time
denbow
willing
to
exhibit
his
books
course
he
is
i
seen
them
it
is
speculative
you
know
honest
straightforward
business
part
do
you
propose
to
take
in
it
yourself
denbow
part
without
the
betting
i
shall
go
in
for
the
business
for
all
i
worth
work
day
and
night
and
look
here
rolfe
it
is
as
if
i
had
no
security
to
offer
you
see
i
have
my
private
income
that
gives
me
a
pull
over
the
ordinary
man
of
business
just
starting
suppose
i
borrow
three
four
five
hundred
pounds
why
i
can
afford
to
make
over
stock
or
receipts
anything
in
that
way
to
the
lender
four
per
cent
that
what
i
offer
if
it
a
simple
loan
would
keep
the
man
what
his
name
decidedly
could
do
without
him
he
has
been
having
shillings
a
week
harvey
rose
and
led
the
way
to
the
his
companion
had
become
a
new
man
the
glow
of
excitement
gave
him
a
healthier
look
and
he
talked
more
like
the
cecil
morphew
of
earlier
days
whom
rolfe
had
found
and
befriended
at
the
hotel
in
brussels
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
in
a
business
of
this
kind
if
only
her
father
was
dead
i
sure
would
mind
ah
rolfe
if
only
she
and
i
both
of
us
had
had
a
little
more
courage
do
you
know
what
i
think
it
the
weak
people
that
do
most
harm
in
the
world
they
suffer
of
course
but
they
make
others
suffer
as
well
if
i
were
like
ah
if
i
were
like
harvey
laughed
chapter
to
alma
on
his
return
he
gave
a
full
account
of
all
he
had
heard
and
done
the
story
of
hugh
carnaby
good
fortune
interested
her
greatly
she
elicited
every
detail
of
which
harvey
had
been
informed
asked
shrewd
questions
and
yet
had
the
air
of
listening
only
for
her
amusement
you
have
thought
redgrave
likely
to
do
such
a
thing
rolfe
inquired
i
do
know
him
at
all
well
he
has
been
a
friend
of
sibyl
for
a
long
time
so
of
course
her
voice
dropped
but
in
a
moment
she
was
questioning
again
say
that
redgrave
went
to
see
him
at
coventry
redgrave
must
have
heard
he
was
there
from
sibyl
i
suppose
that
was
two
days
ago
carnaby
said
why
oh
i
think
it
was
rayner
mann
yesterday
said
mr
redgrave
was
in
paris
cecil
morphew
affairs
had
much
less
interest
for
her
but
when
harvey
said
that
he
was
going
to
town
again
tomorrow
to
look
at
the
shop
in
westminster
bridge
road
she
regarded
him
with
an
odd
smile
surely
wo
get
mixed
up
in
things
of
that
kind
might
be
profitable
he
answered
very
quietly
one
care
to
lose
any
chance
of
that
kind
just
now
he
would
not
meet
her
eyes
but
alma
searched
his
face
for
the
meaning
of
these
words
so
evidently
weighted
you
at
all
uneasy
harvey
a
bit
not
a
bit
answered
the
weak
man
in
him
only
meant
that
if
we
are
going
to
remove
they
sat
for
more
than
five
minutes
in
silence
alma
brain
was
working
very
rapidly
as
her
features
showed
when
he
entered
she
looked
rather
sleepy
now
she
was
thrilling
with
vivid
consciousness
one
would
have
thought
her
absorbed
in
the
solution
of
some
exciting
problem
her
next
words
came
unexpectedly
if
you
mean
what
you
say
about
letting
me
follow
my
own
instincts
i
think
i
shall
decide
to
try
my
fortune
to
give
a
public
recital
he
glanced
at
her
but
did
not
answer
made
a
sort
of
bargain
did
we
she
went
on
quickly
nervously
with
an
endeavour
to
strike
the
playful
note
shall
go
to
abbott
and
i
will
attend
to
what
you
said
about
the
choice
of
acquaintances
surely
neither
of
those
things
can
be
a
subject
of
bargaining
between
us
is
your
interest
in
both
at
least
equal
to
my
own
i
know
of
course
it
was
only
a
joking
way
of
putting
it
me
plainly
he
looked
at
her
now
you
the
slightest
objection
on
any
ground
to
hughie
being
taught
by
abbott
if
so
do
let
us
clear
it
up
i
have
not
a
shadow
of
objection
replied
alma
straightening
herself
a
little
and
answering
his
gaze
with
excessive
frankness
could
i
have
you
think
abbott
will
teach
him
much
better
than
i
could
and
in
that
you
are
quite
right
i
have
no
talent
for
teaching
i
have
much
patience
except
in
music
it
better
every
way
that
he
should
go
to
abbott
i
feel
perfect
confidence
in
her
and
i
should
be
able
to
in
a
mere
stranger
harvey
gave
a
slow
nod
and
appeared
to
have
something
more
of
importance
to
say
but
he
only
asked
how
the
child
cold
had
been
tonight
alma
replied
that
it
was
neither
better
nor
worse
she
spoke
absently
whose
encouragement
do
you
principally
rely
was
rolfe
next
question
that
of
twenty
people
said
principally
wilenski
has
often
praised
me
and
he
does
throw
his
praise
away
and
you
yourself
harvey
did
you
say
last
might
that
i
was
undoubtedly
as
good
as
most
professionals
do
think
i
used
quite
those
words
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
had
never
entered
my
head
that
you
would
take
them
for
encouragement
to
such
a
step
as
this
alma
bent
towards
him
smiling
understand
you
do
think
me
good
enough
now
the
truth
the
truth
and
she
held
up
a
finger
which
she
could
not
succeed
in
keeping
steady
you
shall
have
the
truth
it
too
serious
a
matter
for
making
pretences
my
own
judgment
is
worthless
utterly
it
should
neither
offend
nor
encourage
you
but
it
very
plain
to
me
that
you
dream
of
coming
before
the
public
unless
wilenski
and
perhaps
some
one
else
of
equal
or
better
standing
actually
urges
you
to
it
now
has
he
done
anything
like
that
she
reddened
and
hardly
tried
to
conceal
her
vexation
only
means
harvey
that
you
do
want
me
to
come
out
now
be
more
reasonable
it
does
not
mean
that
in
fact
i
can
say
honestly
it
does
mean
that
at
all
if
wilenski
tells
you
plainly
that
you
ought
to
become
a
professional
violinist
there
no
one
will
wish
you
luck
half
so
heartily
as
i
but
if
it
only
the
encouragement
of
twenty
people
that
means
nothing
i
speaking
simply
as
the
best
friend
you
have
do
run
the
risk
of
a
horrible
disappointment
i
know
you
would
find
that
easy
to
bear
it
would
be
bad
for
you
in
every
way
impelled
by
annoyance
for
the
project
seemed
to
him
delusive
and
his
sense
of
dignity
rose
against
it
harvey
had
begun
with
unwonted
decision
but
he
was
soon
uncomfortably
and
he
spoke
with
effort
vainly
struggling
against
that
peculiar
force
of
alma
personality
which
had
long
ago
subdued
him
when
he
looked
at
her
saw
her
distant
smile
her
pose
of
the
head
as
in
one
who
mildly
rebukes
presumption
he
was
overcome
with
a
feeling
of
solemn
ineptitude
quite
unaware
that
his
last
sentence
was
to
alma
the
most
impressive
the
only
impressive
part
of
his
counsel
suddenly
he
broke
off
and
found
relief
in
unexpected
laughter
now
i
done
my
duty
i
discharged
the
pedagogue
get
rid
of
your
tragic
mask
be
yourself
do
as
you
wish
when
the
time
comes
just
tell
me
what
you
have
decided
so
once
more
did
he
oust
with
what
he
imagined
a
riper
wisdom
one
must
not
take
things
funereally
face
to
face
with
a
woman
in
the
prime
of
her
beauty
he
heard
a
voice
warning
him
against
the
pedantic
spirit
of
middle
age
against
formalism
and
fogeyishness
i
know
you
again
said
alma
softening
but
still
reserved
for
she
did
not
forget
that
he
had
thrown
doubt
upon
her
claims
as
an
artist
an
incident
which
would
not
lose
its
importance
as
she
pondered
it
at
leisure
harvey
sat
late
on
going
upstairs
instead
of
straightway
entering
his
own
room
he
passed
it
with
soft
step
and
paused
by
another
door
that
of
the
chamber
in
which
hughie
slept
under
the
care
of
miss
smith
the
child
had
coughed
in
the
night
during
this
last
week
but
at
present
all
was
quiet
and
with
comfortable
reassurance
the
father
went
to
rest
alma
had
matters
to
occupy
her
more
important
than
a
child
passing
ailment
as
she
slowly
unrobed
herself
by
the
fire
combed
out
her
warm
fragrant
tresses
or
held
mute
dialogue
with
her
eyes
in
the
glass
from
a
ravel
of
uneasy
thoughts
there
detached
itself
first
and
foremost
the
discovery
that
redgrave
had
not
been
in
paris
when
strangeways
said
he
was
what
was
the
meaning
of
this
contradiction
thereto
hung
the
singular
coincidence
of
return
home
exactly
at
the
time
when
she
and
strangeways
happened
to
be
there
she
had
thought
of
it
as
a
coincidence
and
nothing
more
but
if
redgrave
had
deceived
strangeways
as
to
his
movements
the
arrival
took
a
suspicious
significance
there
remained
a
dark
possibility
that
strangeways
knew
what
was
about
to
happen
yet
this
seemed
inconceivable
was
it
inconceivable
why
should
a
woman
of
that
age
and
of
so
much
experience
feel
nervous
about
going
alone
to
her
friend
house
on
such
a
simple
mission
it
appeared
odd
at
the
time
and
was
more
difficult
to
understand
the
more
she
thought
of
it
and
one
heard
such
strange
stories
in
society
of
a
certain
kind
so
many
whispered
hints
of
things
that
would
not
bear
to
be
talked
about
redgrave
had
not
been
in
paris
but
at
coventry
there
again
was
a
puzzling
circumstance
harvey
himself
declared
his
surprise
at
hearing
that
redgrave
had
entered
into
partnership
with
hugh
carnaby
had
sibyl
anything
to
do
with
this
could
she
have
hinted
to
her
friend
the
millionaire
that
her
husband
financial
position
was
anything
but
satisfactory
and
had
redgrave
out
of
pure
friendship
of
course
out
of
pure
friendship
hastened
to
their
succour
this
perplexity
was
almost
as
disturbing
as
that
which
preceded
it
knowing
the
man
of
money
as
she
did
alma
found
it
disagreeable
to
connect
his
name
thus
closely
with
sibyl
disagreeable
in
a
complicated
sense
for
she
had
begun
to
think
of
cyrus
redgrave
as
intimately
associated
with
her
own
ambitions
secret
and
avowed
he
was
to
aid
her
in
winning
fame
as
a
violinist
and
to
this
end
all
possible
use
within
certain
limits
was
to
be
made
of
the
power
she
had
over
him
alma
viewed
the
position
without
the
least
attempt
at
disguising
its
true
nature
she
was
playing
with
fire
knew
it
enjoyed
the
excitement
of
it
trusted
herself
with
the
completest
confidence
to
come
out
of
the
game
unscorched
but
she
felt
assured
that
other
women
in
similar
circumstances
had
engaged
in
much
the
same
encounter
with
cyrus
redgrave
and
could
it
be
imagined
that
sibyl
carnaby
was
one
of
them
sibyl
the
woman
of
culture
of
high
principle
the
critic
of
society
sibyl
to
whom
she
had
so
long
paid
homage
as
to
one
of
the
chosen
of
her
sex
that
redgrave
might
approach
sibyl
with
lawless
thought
she
could
well
believe
and
such
a
possibility
excited
her
indignation
that
sibyl
would
meet
him
on
his
own
terms
she
could
not
for
a
moment
have
credited
but
for
a
that
spoke
in
her
for
the
first
time
the
voice
of
jealousy
where
and
how
often
did
they
meet
to
ask
this
question
was
to
touch
another
motive
of
discontent
ever
since
the
return
to
london
life
alma
had
felt
dissatisfied
with
her
social
position
she
was
the
wife
of
a
gentleman
of
independent
means
in
theory
all
circles
should
be
open
to
her
practically
she
found
herself
very
much
restricted
in
the
choice
of
acquaintances
harvey
had
hinted
that
she
should
be
careful
where
she
went
and
whom
she
knew
that
she
recognised
the
justice
of
this
warning
served
merely
to
irritate
her
against
its
necessity
why
then
did
not
her
husband
exert
himself
to
obtain
better
society
for
her
plainly
he
would
never
take
a
step
in
that
direction
he
had
his
two
or
three
friends
and
found
them
sufficient
he
would
have
liked
to
see
her
very
intimate
with
abbott
perhaps
helping
to
teach
babies
on
the
kindergarten
system
left
to
her
own
resources
she
could
do
little
beyond
refusing
connections
that
were
manifestly
undesirable
sibyl
she
knew
associated
with
people
of
much
higher
standing
only
out
of
curiosity
taking
a
peep
at
the
world
to
which
her
friend
was
restricted
there
had
always
been
a
slight
disparity
in
this
respect
between
them
and
in
former
days
alma
had
accepted
it
without
murmuring
but
why
did
sibyl
just
when
she
could
have
been
socially
helpful
show
a
disposition
to
hold
aloof
course
you
care
nothing
for
people
of
that
kind
carnaby
had
said
after
casually
mentioning
some
family
at
whose
country
house
she
had
been
visiting
it
was
intended
perhaps
as
a
compliment
with
allusion
to
alma
theories
of
the
life
but
in
face
of
the
very
plain
fact
that
such
theories
were
utterly
abandoned
it
sounded
to
alma
a
humiliating
irony
could
it
be
that
sibyl
feared
inquiries
shrank
from
having
it
known
that
she
was
on
intimate
terms
with
the
daughter
of
the
late
bennet
frothingham
a
name
still
too
often
mentioned
in
newspapers
and
elsewhere
the
shadow
of
this
possibility
had
ere
now
flitted
over
alma
mind
she
was
in
the
mood
to
establish
it
as
a
certainty
and
to
indulge
the
resentment
that
naturally
ensued
for
on
more
than
one
occasion
of
late
at
rayner
mann
or
in
some
such
house
she
had
fancied
that
one
person
and
another
had
eyed
her
in
a
way
that
was
not
quite
flattering
and
that
remarks
were
privately
exchanged
about
her
perhaps
harvey
himself
saw
in
the
fact
of
her
parentage
a
social
obstacle
which
made
him
disinclined
to
extend
their
circle
of
common
acquaintances
was
that
what
he
meant
by
his
grave
air
this
evening
was
he
annoyed
at
the
thought
of
a
publicity
which
would
reveal
her
maiden
name
these
currents
of
troubled
feeling
streamed
together
and
bore
her
turbidly
onwards
whither
her
desires
pointed
in
one
way
and
one
way
only
could
she
hope
to
become
triumphantly
conspicuous
to
raise
herself
quite
above
petty
social
prejudices
to
defeat
and
put
to
shame
friends
she
had
never
been
able
to
endure
the
thought
of
mediocrity
one
chance
there
was
she
must
grasp
it
energetically
and
without
delay
and
she
must
make
use
of
all
subsidiary
means
to
her
great
conquest
save
only
the
last
dishonour
that
on
her
own
merit
she
might
rise
to
the
first
rank
of
musicians
alma
did
not
doubt
her
difficulty
lay
in
the
thought
that
it
might
require
a
long
time
a
wearisome
struggle
to
gain
the
universal
recognition
which
alone
would
satisfy
her
therefore
must
cyrus
redgrave
be
brought
to
the
exertion
of
all
his
influence
which
she
imagined
would
assist
her
greatly
therefore
too
must
felix
dymes
be
retained
as
her
warm
friend
probably
his
own
suggestion
as
her
man
of
business
it
was
january
her
must
take
place
in
the
coming
season
in
may
or
june
she
would
sketch
a
programme
at
once
tomorrow
morning
and
then
work
work
work
terrifically
saved
by
the
fervour
of
this
determination
from
brooding
over
mysteries
and
jealousies
alma
lay
down
with
a
contented
sigh
and
was
soon
asleep
thanks
to
the
health
she
still
enjoyed
her
excitability
was
of
the
imagination
rather
than
of
the
blood
and
the
cool
lymphatic
flow
characteristically
feminine
which
mingled
with
the
sanguine
humour
traceable
perhaps
to
a
paternal
source
spared
her
many
an
hour
of
wakefulness
as
it
guarded
her
against
much
graver
peril
on
sunday
morning
she
generally
went
to
church
not
because
of
any
spiritual
impulse
but
out
of
habit
in
wales
harvey
often
accompanied
her
at
pinner
he
ceased
to
do
so
but
neither
then
nor
now
had
any
talk
on
the
subject
passed
between
them
alma
took
it
for
granted
that
her
husband
was
very
in
matters
of
faith
she
gathered
from
her
reading
that
every
man
of
education
nowadays
dispensed
with
dogmas
and
for
her
own
part
it
was
merely
an
accident
that
she
had
not
sought
to
attract
attention
by
pronounced
freethinking
sibyl
carnaby
went
to
church
as
a
matter
of
course
and
never
spoke
for
or
against
orthodoxy
had
sibyl
been
more
in
this
direction
undoubtedly
alma
would
long
ago
have
followed
her
example
both
of
them
in
girlhood
had
passed
through
a
great
deal
of
direct
religious
teaching
and
both
would
have
shrunk
amazed
if
called
upon
to
make
the
slightest
sacrifice
in
the
name
of
their
presumed
creed
this
morning
however
alma
remained
at
home
and
one
of
the
first
things
she
did
was
to
write
to
sibyl
asking
when
it
would
be
convenient
for
her
friend
to
give
her
private
talk
then
she
wrote
to
felix
dymes
addressing
the
letter
to
the
care
of
his
publishers
at
midday
as
harvey
had
gone
to
town
on
his
business
with
cecil
morphew
she
decided
to
run
over
to
and
ask
her
friends
for
lunch
in
return
for
which
she
would
make
known
to
them
her
startling
project
it
was
a
wretched
day
hughie
must
not
go
out
and
pauline
good
creature
would
amuse
him
in
one
way
and
another
all
the
afternoon
as
it
chanced
her
surprise
visit
could
not
have
been
worse
timed
for
leach
was
in
a
state
of
collapse
after
a
violent
quarrel
the
day
before
with
her
who
quitted
the
house
at
a
notice
luncheon
in
the
admissible
sense
of
the
word
there
was
none
to
be
had
leach
finding
the
house
intolerable
when
he
arrived
on
saturday
afternoon
had
gone
back
to
his
bachelor
quarters
and
the
girls
when
alma
presented
herself
were
just
sitting
down
alone
to
what
the
housemaid
chose
to
give
them
but
such
an
old
friend
could
not
be
turned
away
because
of
domestic
mishap
not
until
they
had
despatched
the
unsatisfactory
meal
and
were
cosy
in
the
did
alma
reveal
her
great
purpose
dora
leach
happened
to
have
a
slight
acquaintance
with
a
professional
pianist
who
had
recently
come
before
the
public
and
alma
began
by
inquiring
whether
her
friend
could
obtain
information
as
to
the
expenses
of
the
first
given
by
that
lady
afraid
i
do
know
her
quite
well
enough
replied
miss
leach
it
for
are
you
thinking
really
you
are
the
sisters
became
joyously
excited
splendid
idea
they
had
feared
it
was
impossible
oh
she
might
count
with
certainty
upon
a
brilliant
success
they
began
to
talk
about
the
programme
and
what
professionals
would
she
engage
to
take
part
in
the
concert
when
alma
mentioned
that
the
illustrious
felix
dymes
had
offered
to
undertake
the
management
of
her
business
interest
rose
to
the
highest
point
felix
dymes
would
of
course
be
a
tower
of
strength
though
tempted
to
speak
of
the
support
she
might
expect
from
another
great
man
alma
refrained
her
reason
being
that
she
meant
to
ask
dora
to
accompany
her
to
the
crystal
palace
next
saturday
if
as
was
almost
certain
redgrave
met
them
there
it
would
be
unpleasant
to
let
dora
surmise
that
the
meeting
was
not
by
chance
they
chattered
for
two
or
three
hours
and
among
other
things
made
merry
over
a
girl
of
their
acquaintance
struggling
with
flagrant
poverty
who
aimed
at
a
professional
career
really
would
be
kindness
said
dora
tell
her
she
has
the
least
chance
but
one
ca
do
that
she
was
here
the
other
day
playing
to
us
oh
for
a
time
she
said
her
bow
would
have
to
be
rehaired
and
when
i
looked
at
it
i
saw
it
was
all
greasy
and
black
near
the
frog
from
her
dirty
fingers
it
only
wanted
washing
i
just
managed
to
edge
in
a
hint
about
soap
and
water
but
she
very
touchy
one
has
to
be
so
careful
with
her
dreadfully
awkward
you
know
put
in
gerda
talk
to
people
who
are
so
is
it
it
came
out
one
day
that
she
had
been
peeling
potatoes
for
their
dinner
it
makes
one
so
uncomfortable
she
really
need
not
have
mentioned
it
the
public
halls
were
discussed
which
would
alma
select
then
again
the
programme
would
she
play
the
adagio
meaning
of
course
that
in
spohr
concerto
no
not
the
adagio
not
on
any
account
the
adagio
something
of
bach
yes
perhaps
the
chaconne
and
brahms
there
was
the
sonata
in
a
for
violin
and
piano
a
stiff
piece
but
one
must
not
be
too
popular
heaven
forbid
that
one
should
catch
at
cheap
applause
how
about
a
trio
what
was
that
thing
of
dvorak
at
st
james
hall
not
long
ago
yes
the
trio
in
b
flat
piano
violin
and
at
least
a
score
of
pieces
were
jotted
down
some
from
memory
some
picked
out
of
old
programmes
of
which
dora
produced
a
great
portfolio
interruption
came
at
length
a
servant
entering
to
say
that
leach
felt
so
ill
she
wished
the
doctor
to
be
summoned
bother
mamma
and
her
illnesses
exclaimed
the
vivacious
gerda
when
the
intruder
was
waved
off
all
nonsense
you
know
she
will
quarrel
with
servants
and
get
herself
into
a
state
it
have
to
be
a
i
see
it
coming
nearer
every
day
having
made
an
appointment
with
dora
for
next
saturday
alma
took
leave
and
went
home
in
excellent
spirits
everything
seemed
to
plan
itself
the
time
had
come
the
moment
of
destiny
doubtless
she
had
been
wise
in
waiting
thus
long
had
she
come
forward
only
a
year
or
so
after
her
father
tragedy
people
might
have
said
she
was
making
profit
of
a
vulgar
sensation
it
would
have
seemed
in
bad
taste
necessity
would
have
appeared
to
urge
her
now
such
remarks
were
impossible
harvey
rolfe
sounded
much
better
than
miss
alma
frothingham
was
it
to
be
or
ought
she
to
call
herself
people
did
use
the
madame
even
with
an
english
name
madame
rolfe
madame
harvey
rolfe
that
made
her
laugh
it
had
a
touch
of
the
ridiculous
it
suggested
millinery
rather
than
music
better
to
reject
such
silly
affectations
and
use
her
proper
name
boldly
it
was
to
be
expected
of
course
that
people
in
general
would
soon
discover
her
maiden
name
whispers
would
go
round
facts
might
even
get
into
the
newspapers
well
she
herself
had
done
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
and
if
curiosity
helped
her
to
success
why
so
much
the
better
in
all
likelihood
it
help
her
but
she
did
not
dwell
upon
this
adventitious
encouragement
a
more
legitimate
source
of
hope
revealed
itself
in
strangeways
allusion
to
her
personal
advantages
she
was
not
on
that
point
there
needed
no
assurance
her
looks
if
anything
had
improved
and
possibly
she
owed
something
to
her
experiment
in
to
the
air
of
mountain
and
of
sea
felix
dymes
cyrus
redgrave
not
to
speak
of
certain
other
people
no
matter
for
all
that
she
must
pay
grave
attention
to
the
subject
of
dress
her
recital
would
doubtless
be
given
in
the
afternoon
according
to
custom
so
that
it
was
not
a
case
of
but
her
attire
must
be
nothing
short
of
perfection
in
its
kind
could
she
speak
about
it
with
sibyl
perhaps
yet
perhaps
not
she
was
very
anxious
to
see
sibyl
and
felt
that
a
great
deal
depended
upon
their
coming
interview
this
took
place
on
tuesday
for
sibyl
replied
at
once
to
the
note
and
begged
her
to
come
without
delay
at
twelve
i
do
little
in
these
gloomy
days
but
read
am
becoming
quite
a
bookworm
why
have
you
been
silent
so
long
i
was
on
the
very
point
of
writing
to
you
for
i
wish
to
see
you
particularly
and
when
the
servant
opened
her
door
sibyl
was
discovered
in
the
attitude
of
a
severe
student
bending
over
a
table
on
which
lay
many
volumes
she
would
not
have
been
herself
had
there
appeared
any
neglect
or
unbecomingness
in
her
costume
but
she
wore
the
least
pretentious
of
morning
gowns
close
at
throat
and
wrist
which
aided
her
look
of
mental
concentration
and
alertness
she
rose
with
alacrity
and
the
visitor
using
her
utmost
keenness
in
scrutiny
of
countenance
found
that
her
own
eyes
not
sibyl
were
the
first
to
fall
working
as
if
i
had
an
examination
to
pass
it
the
best
thing
in
weather
such
as
this
keeps
one
in
health
i
believe
you
of
course
have
your
music
which
answers
the
same
purpose
i
going
in
for
the
renaissance
always
wished
to
make
a
thorough
study
of
it
hugh
is
appalled
he
never
imagined
i
had
so
much
energy
he
says
i
shall
be
writing
a
book
next
and
why
not
course
you
could
replied
alma
clever
enough
for
anything
her
suspicions
evaporated
in
this
cosy
cloister
she
wondered
how
she
could
have
conceived
such
a
thought
of
sibyl
who
dressed
so
simply
had
a
girlish
air
a
beauty
as
of
maidenhood
exhilarated
by
her
ambitious
hopes
she
turned
in
heart
to
the
old
friendship
felt
her
admiration
revive
and
spoke
it
freely
know
i
not
stupid
said
sibyl
leaning
back
as
if
a
little
weary
there
the
pity
of
it
that
i
never
made
more
use
of
my
brains
of
course
those
years
abroad
were
lost
though
i
suppose
i
got
to
know
a
little
more
of
the
world
and
since
we
came
back
i
have
had
no
peace
of
mind
did
you
guess
that
perhaps
your
husband
knew
about
things
from
hugh
was
afraid
you
might
be
getting
rather
anxious
but
as
you
never
said
anything
yourself
never
should
have
done
i
hate
talking
about
money
and
you
know
that
things
are
looking
better
sibyl
confident
smile
drew
one
of
like
meaning
from
alma
husband
had
good
news
i
know
when
harvey
met
him
on
saturday
sounds
good
said
sibyl
i
take
it
for
granted
it
will
be
as
good
as
it
sounds
if
that
complicated
well
so
is
business
and
i
do
profess
to
understand
the
details
i
can
only
say
that
hugh
seems
to
be
a
good
deal
shrewder
and
more
practical
than
i
thought
him
he
is
always
making
friends
with
what
i
consider
the
wrong
kind
of
people
now
at
last
he
has
got
hold
of
just
the
right
man
and
it
very
much
puzzles
me
how
he
did
it
i
have
known
redgrave
you
heard
mr
redgrave
i
known
him
for
several
years
now
and
between
ourselves
i
never
expected
to
benefit
by
the
acquaintance
her
laugh
was
so
significant
that
alma
had
much
ado
to
keep
a
steady
face
know
things
are
said
about
him
she
murmured
said
about
him
as
you
discreetly
put
it
my
dear
alma
the
voice
still
rippled
with
laughter
should
imagine
hugh
has
heard
them
but
i
suppose
a
man
of
the
world
thinks
nothing
of
such
trifles
and
after
all
she
grew
serious
would
rather
trust
hugh
judgment
than
general
gossip
hugh
thinks
him
a
very
good
fellow
they
were
together
a
little
in
scotland
last
autumn
you
know
and
it
very
wrong
to
make
fun
of
it
and
i
should
repeat
the
story
to
anyone
but
you
redgrave
confided
to
him
that
he
was
a
blighted
being
the
victim
of
an
unhappy
love
in
early
life
can
you
quite
picture
it
has
an
odd
sound
replied
alma
struggling
with
rather
tense
nerves
you
believe
the
story
ca
see
why
in
the
world
such
a
man
should
invent
it
it
seems
he
wanted
to
marry
someone
who
preferred
someone
else
and
since
then
he
has
sibyl
rippled
off
again
has
what
blighted
my
dear
of
course
people
have
different
ways
of
showing
blight
redgrave
it
is
rumoured
hides
his
head
in
a
hermitage
somewhere
in
the
north
of
italy
by
one
of
the
lakes
no
doubt
he
lives
on
olives
and
macaroni
and
broods
over
what
have
been
did
you
ever
hear
of
that
hermitage
alma
colour
heightened
ever
so
little
and
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
questioner
with
involuntary
fixedness
the
last
shadow
of
doubt
regarding
sibyl
having
disappeared
no
woman
with
an
uneasy
conscience
she
said
to
herself
could
talk
in
this
way
she
had
now
to
guard
herself
against
the
betrayal
of
suspicious
sensibilities
sibyl
of
course
meant
nothing
personal
by
these
jesting
allusions
how
could
she
but
it
was
with
a
hard
voice
that
alma
declared
her
ignorance
of
redgrave
habits
at
home
or
in
retreat
by
italian
lakes
does
concern
us
agreed
her
friend
has
chosen
to
put
his
money
into
hugh
business
and
from
one
point
of
view
that
a
virtuous
action
hugh
says
he
did
suggest
anything
of
the
kind
but
i
fancy
the
idea
must
have
been
led
up
to
at
some
time
or
other
the
poor
fellow
has
been
horridly
worried
and
perhaps
he
let
fall
a
word
or
two
he
does
care
to
confess
however
it
came
about
i
immensely
glad
both
for
his
sake
and
my
own
my
mind
is
enormously
relieved
and
that
how
i
come
to
be
working
at
the
renaissance
alma
took
the
first
opportunity
of
giving
the
conversation
a
turn
it
was
not
so
easy
as
she
had
anticipated
to
make
her
announcement
for
to
her
own
mind
cyrus
redgrave
and
the
great
ambition
were
at
every
moment
suggestive
of
each
other
and
sibyl
in
this
peculiar
mood
might
throw
out
disturbing
remarks
or
ask
unwelcome
questions
only
one
recent
occurrence
called
for
concealment
happily
sibyl
no
longer
met
strangeways
whose
character
had
taken
such
a
doubtful
hue
and
redgrave
himself
could
assuredly
be
trusted
for
discretion
whatever
his
real
part
in
that
perplexing
scene
at
he
bungalow
feel
the
same
want
as
you
do
said
alma
after
a
little
transitional
talk
something
to
keep
me
busy
of
course
it
must
be
music
but
music
at
home
and
at
other
people
homes
is
enough
you
know
my
old
revolt
against
the
bonds
of
the
amateur
i
going
to
break
out
or
try
to
what
would
you
give
for
my
chances
dear
i
am
no
capitalist
replied
her
friend
with
animation
such
a
bargain
as
that
you
must
go
among
the
great
speculators
experience
seems
to
point
to
mr
redgrave
please
be
serious
i
am
i
should
like
to
have
the
purchase
of
your
chances
for
a
trifle
of
a
few
thousand
pounds
alma
flush
of
discomposure
more
traitorous
than
she
imagined
transformed
itself
under
a
gratified
smile
really
think
that
i
might
do
something
worth
the
trouble
i
mean
though
of
course
no
one
despises
money
but
a
real
artistic
success
sibyl
made
no
reply
she
seemed
in
thorough
agreement
with
those
other
friends
of
alma
who
had
received
the
project
enthusiastically
a
dozen
tickets
at
least
a
dozen
she
would
at
once
answer
for
but
as
though
an
unwelcome
word
must
needs
mingle
with
her
pleasantest
talk
today
she
went
on
to
speak
of
alma
husband
what
did
he
think
of
the
idea
looks
on
that
all
alma
replied
playfully
i
succeed
he
will
be
pleased
if
i
do
he
will
have
plenty
of
consolation
to
offer
harvey
and
i
respect
each
other
independence
the
great
secret
of
marriage
do
you
think
we
ask
each
other
advice
and
take
it
or
not
as
we
choose
i
fancy
he
does
quite
like
the
thought
of
my
playing
for
money
but
if
it
were
he
would
like
it
still
less
he
finds
consolation
in
the
thought
that
i
just
amusing
myself
wish
you
would
both
come
over
and
dine
with
us
quietly
said
sibyl
after
reflecting
with
a
smile
would
do
us
all
good
i
do
see
many
people
nowadays
and
i
getting
rather
tired
of
ordinary
society
after
all
it
great
waste
of
time
i
think
hugh
is
more
inclined
to
settle
down
and
be
quiet
among
his
friends
what
day
would
suit
you
alma
engrossed
in
other
thoughts
named
a
day
at
random
part
of
her
scheme
was
still
undisclosed
she
had
a
special
reason
for
wishing
sibyl
to
know
of
her
relations
with
felix
dymes
yet
feared
that
she
might
not
hit
exactly
the
right
tone
in
speaking
of
him
course
i
must
have
a
man
of
business
and
who
do
you
think
has
offered
his
services
sibyl
was
not
particularly
impressed
by
the
mention
of
dymes
name
she
had
only
a
slight
personal
acquaintance
with
him
and
cared
little
for
his
reputation
as
a
composer
had
a
note
from
him
this
morning
alma
continued
asks
me
to
see
him
today
at
the
apollo
the
theatre
you
know
they
going
to
produce
his
comic
opera
blue
roses
of
course
you
heard
of
it
i
shall
feel
rather
nervous
about
going
there
but
it
be
a
new
experience
or
do
you
think
it
would
be
more
discreet
if
i
got
him
to
come
to
pinner
did
think
artists
cared
about
those
small
proprieties
answered
sibyl
laughing
of
course
that
the
right
way
to
regard
it
let
me
show
you
his
letter
she
took
it
from
her
little
bag
trifle
impudent
do
you
think
dymes
has
a
great
opinion
of
himself
and
absolutely
no
manners
if
you
can
keep
him
in
hand
they
exchanged
glances
and
laughed
together
fear
of
that
said
alma
he
just
the
kind
of
man
to
be
very
useful
his
music
ah
well
but
he
has
popularity
and
a
great
many
people
take
him
at
his
own
estimate
impudence
does
go
a
long
way
sibyl
nodded
and
smiled
vaguely
dymes
had
suggested
a
meeting
at
three
and
to
this
alma
had
already
given
her
assent
by
telegraph
she
lunched
with
carnaby
who
talked
a
great
deal
about
the
renaissance
left
immediately
after
to
visit
a
few
shops
and
drove
up
to
the
apollo
theatre
at
the
appointed
time
her
name
sufficed
at
once
she
was
respectfully
conducted
to
a
small
room
furnished
only
with
a
table
and
chairs
and
hung
about
with
portraits
of
theatrical
people
where
dymes
sat
by
the
fire
smoking
a
cigarette
the
illustrious
man
apologised
for
receiving
her
here
instead
of
in
the
manager
room
which
he
had
hoped
to
make
use
of
is
in
there
wrangling
about
something
with
sophy
challis
and
they
likely
to
slang
each
other
for
an
hour
or
two
make
yourself
comfortable
it
rather
hot
take
off
those
furry
things
you
replied
alma
concealing
her
nervousness
with
malapert
vivacity
shall
be
quite
comfortable
in
my
own
way
it
rather
hot
and
your
smoke
is
rather
thick
so
i
shall
leave
the
door
a
little
open
dymes
showed
his
annoyance
but
could
offer
no
objection
getting
into
shape
for
this
day
week
littlestone
calls
the
opera
blue
noses
it
has
been
so
confoundedly
cold
at
rehearsals
alma
was
seized
by
the
ludicrous
suggestion
and
laughed
without
restraint
her
companion
joined
in
his
loud
neigh
drowning
her
more
melodious
merriment
this
put
them
on
natural
terms
of
comradeship
and
then
followed
a
long
animated
talk
dymes
was
of
opinion
that
the
hiring
of
a
hall
and
the
fees
of
supplementary
musicians
might
be
defrayed
out
of
the
sale
of
tickets
but
there
remained
the
item
of
advertisement
and
on
this
subject
he
had
large
ideas
he
wanted
do
the
thing
properly
otherwise
he
would
do
it
at
all
but
alma
was
to
take
no
thought
for
the
cost
let
it
all
be
left
to
him
want
to
succeed
all
right
let
your
fiddling
be
up
to
the
mark
and
i
answer
for
the
public
it
all
between
you
and
me
you
say
who
is
doing
the
job
for
you
ada
wellington
comes
off
on
may
the
i
shall
put
you
down
for
a
fortnight
later
that
gives
you
nearly
four
months
to
prepare
do
overdo
it
keep
right
in
health
take
plenty
of
exercise
you
look
very
well
now
keep
it
up
and
i
only
wish
it
was
the
stage
instead
of
the
platform
but
no
use
talking
about
that
i
suppose
use
whatever
alma
replied
flushing
with
various
emotions
in
the
course
of
his
free
talk
it
happened
that
he
addressed
her
as
she
did
not
check
him
but
when
the
name
again
fell
from
his
lips
she
said
quietly
with
a
straight
look
think
not
the
proper
name
if
you
please
dymes
took
the
rebuke
when
their
conversation
was
over
he
wished
her
to
go
with
him
to
a
restaurant
for
tea
but
alma
insisted
on
catching
a
certain
train
at
baker
street
and
dymes
had
to
be
satisfied
with
the
promise
of
another
interview
shortly
chapter
a
visit
was
due
from
frothingham
who
had
not
been
seen
at
pinner
for
more
than
six
months
she
would
have
come
at
new
year
but
an
attack
of
influenza
upset
her
plans
now
she
wrote
to
announce
her
arrival
on
saturday
wish
it
had
been
monday
said
alma
have
to
go
to
the
crystal
palace
it
imperative
asked
her
husband
there
something
new
of
sterndale
bennett
and
i
asked
dora
it
seemed
to
harvey
that
this
arrangement
might
have
been
put
aside
without
great
inconvenience
but
as
usual
he
made
no
comment
as
he
would
be
in
town
on
saturday
he
promised
to
meet
their
visitor
at
waterloo
alma
he
thought
had
never
shown
much
gratitude
for
her
constant
kindness
during
the
past
she
had
now
and
then
complained
of
the
trouble
of
answering
letters
and
the
news
of
illness
at
basingstoke
drew
from
her
only
a
few
words
of
conventional
sympathy
to
hughie
who
frequently
received
presents
from
she
rarely
spoke
of
the
affectionate
giver
a
remark
of
hers
recently
on
some
piece
of
news
from
frothingham
bore
an
obvious
suggestion
wonder
she
said
a
single
person
has
been
really
benefited
by
all
the
money
mamma
has
given
away
is
it
likely
she
has
done
much
more
harm
than
good
there
was
truth
in
his
surmise
that
alma
sometimes
thought
with
jealousy
of
frothingham
having
had
control
of
a
fortune
whilst
she
the
only
child
of
him
who
made
the
money
possessed
nothing
of
her
own
the
same
trend
of
feeling
appeared
in
a
word
or
two
of
alma
when
a
daily
paper
in
speaking
of
a
paltry
dividend
offered
at
last
to
the
creditors
in
one
branch
of
bennet
frothingham
speculations
used
a
particularly
bitter
phrase
should
have
felt
that
once
now
in
these
days
alma
suffered
from
a
revival
of
the
indignation
which
had
so
perturbed
her
in
the
time
just
before
her
marriage
if
now
she
had
possessed
even
a
little
money
it
would
have
made
her
independent
in
a
sense
far
more
tangible
than
that
of
the
friendly
understanding
with
her
husband
she
strongly
disliked
the
thought
of
making
harvey
responsible
for
the
expenses
of
her
had
it
been
possible
to
procure
a
small
sum
by
any
honest
means
she
would
eagerly
have
turned
to
it
but
no
method
seemed
discoverable
on
her
journey
homeward
after
the
interview
with
felix
dymes
her
mind
was
full
of
the
money
question
what
did
dymes
mean
by
bidding
her
take
no
thought
for
expenses
could
it
have
occurred
to
his
outrageous
vanity
that
she
might
be
persuaded
to
become
his
debtor
with
implied
obligation
of
gratitude
not
with
impunity
could
her
thought
accustom
itself
to
stray
in
regions
forbidden
how
firm
soever
her
resolve
to
hold
bodily
aloof
imagination
was
beginning
to
show
the
inevitable
taint
with
cyrus
redgrave
she
had
passed
from
disdainful
resentment
through
phases
of
tolerance
to
an
interested
flirtation
perilous
on
every
side
in
felix
dymes
she
easily
perhaps
not
unwillingly
detected
a
motive
like
to
redgrave
and
already
for
her
own
purposes
she
was
permitting
him
to
regard
her
as
a
woman
not
too
sensitive
not
too
scrupulous
these
tactics
might
not
be
pleasant
or
strictly
honourable
but
she
fancied
they
were
forced
upon
her
alma
had
begun
to
compassionate
herself
a
dangerous
situation
her
battle
had
to
be
fought
alone
she
was
going
forth
to
conquer
the
world
by
her
mere
talents
and
can
a
woman
disregard
the
auxiliary
weapons
of
beauty
if
dymes
chose
to
speculate
in
hopes
ludicrously
phantasmal
was
that
her
affair
she
smiled
at
the
picture
of
two
men
her
devoted
servants
exerting
themselves
to
the
utmost
for
her
advantage
yet
without
a
syllable
of
express
encouragement
and
foredoomed
to
a
disappointment
which
would
be
perfectly
plain
to
them
could
they
but
use
their
throughout
this
week
harvey
did
not
behave
quite
as
usual
to
her
or
so
alma
thought
he
had
not
the
customary
jocoseness
when
they
met
at
the
close
of
day
he
asked
no
questions
about
how
she
had
spent
her
time
his
manner
was
preoccupied
one
evening
she
challenged
him
are
worrying
about
what
you
think
my
foolishness
of
what
folly
are
you
guilty
ambition
then
no
he
laughed
as
if
the
thought
genuinely
amused
him
should
i
worry
about
it
do
work
too
hard
that
all
no
i
was
thinking
of
a
squalid
little
ambition
of
my
own
i
have
an
idea
morphew
may
make
something
of
that
business
and
i
want
him
to
for
the
fellow
own
good
it
wonderful
how
near
he
has
been
to
going
to
the
devil
once
for
all
i
fancy
i
got
him
now
by
the
i
may
hold
him
ca
call
that
a
squalid
ambition
said
alma
wishing
to
be
amiable
that
side
of
it
no
but
i
decided
to
put
a
little
money
into
the
business
nothing
that
matters
but
it
may
just
as
well
be
made
safe
if
a
little
trouble
will
do
it
i
was
wondering
how
it
would
be
if
i
worked
a
little
down
yonder
kept
morphew
in
sight
distance
is
the
chief
objection
you
think
of
moving
to
gunnersbury
i
do
i
thinking
of
it
seriously
will
you
go
over
with
me
one
day
next
week
better
be
saturday
abbott
will
be
free
it
was
unfortunate
that
alma
had
not
been
able
to
establish
an
intimacy
with
mary
abbott
they
saw
each
other
very
rarely
and
as
harvey
perceived
made
no
progress
in
friendship
this
did
not
surprise
him
they
were
too
unlike
in
temper
intellect
and
circumstances
whether
to
these
obstacles
should
be
added
another
more
serious
harvey
could
not
quite
assure
himself
he
had
suspected
that
alma
entertained
a
slight
jealousy
natural
perhaps
though
utterly
without
substantial
cause
he
even
reckoned
with
this
when
proposing
to
put
the
child
under
abbott
care
thinking
that
in
revolt
against
such
an
alternative
alma
might
be
impelled
to
take
the
duty
upon
herself
that
nothing
of
the
kind
had
resulted
seemed
to
prove
that
whatever
feeling
might
occasionally
have
arisen
in
alma
she
did
not
regard
his
friend
with
any
approach
to
hostility
for
his
own
part
he
had
always
felt
that
the
memory
of
bennet
frothingham
must
needs
forbid
abbott
to
think
with
unrestrained
kindliness
of
alma
and
but
for
alma
herself
he
would
scarce
have
ventured
to
bring
them
together
that
they
were
at
least
on
amiable
terms
must
be
held
as
much
as
could
be
hoped
for
with
regard
to
mary
efficiency
as
a
teacher
his
opinion
had
grown
more
favourable
since
he
had
seen
her
in
her
own
home
time
and
experience
were
moulding
her
he
thought
to
a
task
undertaken
first
of
all
in
a
spirit
of
she
appeared
to
be
successful
in
winning
the
confidence
of
parents
and
she
no
longer
complained
of
inability
to
make
herself
liked
by
her
little
pupils
best
of
all
she
was
undoubtedly
devoting
herself
to
the
work
with
all
the
powers
of
her
mind
making
it
the
sole
and
sufficient
purpose
of
her
life
harvey
felt
no
misgiving
he
spoke
his
true
thought
when
he
said
that
he
would
rather
trust
hughie
to
abbott
than
to
any
other
teacher
it
was
with
surprise
therefore
and
some
annoyance
that
he
received
alma
reply
to
his
proposal
for
their
going
over
to
gunnersbury
next
week
you
quite
sure
she
said
rather
coldly
abbott
will
teach
better
than
pauline
is
only
that
hughie
must
have
companions
i
thought
we
had
agreed
about
it
you
inquired
who
his
companions
will
be
the
ordinary
children
of
ordinary
people
he
replied
with
some
impatience
do
know
that
babies
are
likely
to
corrupt
each
other
but
of
course
you
will
ask
abbott
all
about
that
kind
of
thing
or
anything
else
you
wish
alma
shook
her
head
laughing
carelessly
no
that
is
all
in
hands
you
have
discussed
it
with
her
have
you
have
so
much
as
mentioned
it
but
of
course
i
am
quite
willing
to
relieve
you
of
all
trouble
in
the
matter
his
tone
seemed
to
startle
alma
for
she
looked
up
at
him
quickly
and
spoke
in
a
more
serious
voice
do
think
we
quite
understand
each
other
about
hughie
why
should
you
be
so
anxious
he
seems
to
me
to
be
doing
very
well
remember
only
a
little
more
than
three
years
old
quite
a
baby
as
you
say
i
do
think
he
would
feel
the
want
of
companions
for
another
year
at
least
harvey
met
her
look
and
replied
quietly
is
that
i
anxious
about
him
i
have
to
plan
for
his
education
that
all
beginning
rather
early
fathers
do
generally
look
after
their
children
so
young
they
do
said
harvey
with
a
laugh
do
here
and
there
surely
you
do
mean
that
i
am
neglectful
harvey
at
all
teaching
is
your
metier
alma
have
always
confessed
that
but
then
the
time
for
teaching
hughie
has
hardly
come
what
can
pauline
do
but
just
see
that
he
does
get
into
mischief
the
very
reason
why
he
would
be
better
for
two
or
three
hours
a
day
with
some
one
who
knows
to
teach
a
child
of
his
age
it
as
unimportant
as
you
think
pauline
does
very
well
but
abbott
will
do
better
vexed
at
his
own
cowardliness
for
he
could
not
utter
the
words
that
leaped
to
his
tongue
harvey
fell
into
a
perverse
insistence
on
mrs
abbott
merits
he
had
meant
to
confine
himself
within
the
safe
excuse
that
the
child
needed
companionship
forbidden
the
natural
relief
of
a
wholesome
hearty
outburst
of
anger
which
would
have
done
good
in
many
ways
his
nerves
drove
him
into
smothered
petulance
with
the
result
that
alma
misread
him
and
saw
in
his
words
a
significance
quite
apart
from
their
plain
meaning
have
not
the
least
intention
of
interfering
harvey
she
said
with
her
distant
smile
the
next
few
months
i
shall
be
very
busy
indeed
only
one
thing
i
would
ask
you
do
think
of
leaving
this
house
before
midsummer
i
shall
probably
give
my
recital
in
may
and
it
would
be
rather
inconvenient
shall
be
arranged
to
suit
you
at
all
not
at
all
she
exclaimed
cheerfully
do
ask
so
much
as
that
it
would
be
unreasonable
we
are
neither
of
us
to
stand
in
the
other
way
is
that
the
agreement
tell
me
your
plans
and
you
shall
know
mine
and
i
sure
everything
will
be
managed
very
well
so
the
conversation
ended
satisfactorily
to
neither
harvey
aware
of
having
spoken
indiscreetly
felt
that
he
was
still
more
to
blame
for
allowing
his
wife
a
freedom
of
which
she
threatened
to
make
absurd
use
and
alma
her
feelings
both
as
wife
and
mother
sensibly
perturbed
resented
the
imputation
which
seemed
to
have
been
thrown
upon
her
conduct
this
resentment
was
of
course
none
the
less
enduring
because
conscience
took
her
husband
side
she
remembered
her
appointment
tomorrow
practically
an
appointment
with
cyrus
redgrave
at
the
crystal
palace
would
not
that
be
more
difficult
to
confess
than
anything
she
could
reasonably
suppose
to
have
happened
between
harvey
and
mary
abbott
yet
more
than
ever
she
hoped
to
meet
redgrave
to
hold
him
by
a
new
link
of
illusory
temptation
that
he
might
exert
himself
to
the
utmost
in
promoting
her
success
for
among
the
impulses
which
urged
her
forward
her
reasons
for
desiring
a
public
triumph
was
one
which
harvey
perhaps
never
for
a
moment
imagined
a
desire
to
shine
gloriously
in
the
eyes
of
her
husband
harvey
would
never
do
her
justice
until
constrained
by
the
voice
of
the
world
year
after
year
he
held
her
in
less
esteem
he
had
as
good
as
said
that
he
did
not
think
her
capable
of
taking
a
place
among
professional
violinists
disguise
it
how
he
might
he
secretly
wished
her
to
become
a
mere
domestic
creature
to
abandon
hopes
that
were
nothing
better
than
a
proof
of
vanity
this
went
to
alma
heart
and
rankled
there
he
should
see
he
should
confess
his
error
in
all
its
injurious
and
humiliating
extent
at
whatever
cost
at
all
any
cost
the
day
of
her
triumph
should
come
about
foreseeing
it
she
had
less
difficulty
in
keeping
calm
when
the
excellencies
of
abbott
were
vaunted
before
her
when
harvey
simply
ignored
all
that
in
herself
compensated
the
domestic
shortcoming
of
course
she
was
not
a
model
of
the
virtues
who
expected
an
artist
to
be
that
but
harvey
denied
this
claim
and
of
all
the
motives
contributing
to
her
aspiration
none
had
such
unfailing
force
as
the
vehement
resolve
to
prove
him
wrong
next
morning
the
weather
was
so
bad
that
harvey
asked
whether
she
had
not
better
give
up
her
expedition
to
the
crystal
palace
alma
smiled
and
shook
her
head
think
i
go
only
for
amusement
it
so
difficult
to
make
you
understand
that
these
things
are
serious
of
the
lungs
is
serious
i
do
think
frothingham
will
face
it
there
probably
be
a
telegram
from
her
but
by
midday
the
fierce
wind
and
driving
sleet
had
abated
though
the
outlook
remained
cheerless
enough
after
an
early
lunch
alma
set
forth
dora
leach
joined
her
in
the
train
and
thus
they
travelled
through
sooty
gloom
under
or
above
ground
from
the
extreme
north
to
the
farthest
south
of
london
alighting
at
length
with
such
a
ringing
of
the
ears
such
an
impression
of
roar
and
crash
and
shriek
as
made
the
strangest
prelude
to
a
feast
of
music
ever
devised
in
the
history
their
seats
having
been
taken
in
advance
they
entered
a
few
moments
before
the
concert
began
and
found
themselves
amid
a
scanty
audience
on
either
side
of
them
were
vacant
places
alma
did
not
dare
to
glance
round
about
if
redgrave
were
here
and
looked
for
her
he
would
have
no
difficulty
in
discovering
where
she
sat
probably
too
he
could
manage
to
take
possession
of
the
chair
at
her
side
and
this
was
exactly
what
happened
though
not
until
the
first
piece
had
been
performed
congratulate
you
on
your
zeal
spoke
the
voice
which
always
put
her
in
mind
of
sunny
mountains
and
a
blue
lake
a
compliment
in
return
said
alma
with
a
sudden
illumination
of
her
features
you
one
of
the
regular
attendants
you
remember
his
voice
dropped
so
low
that
he
hardly
seemed
to
address
her
promised
myself
the
pleasure
alma
pretended
not
to
hear
she
turned
to
her
companion
spoke
a
word
and
renewed
the
very
slight
acquaintance
which
had
existed
a
few
years
ago
between
redgrave
and
miss
leach
then
the
sound
of
an
instrument
imposed
silence
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
alma
affected
to
be
absorbed
in
music
when
not
consciously
hearing
it
at
all
today
the
circumstances
made
such
distraction
pardonable
but
often
enough
she
had
sat
thus
with
countenance
composed
or
ecstatic
only
seeming
to
listen
even
when
a
master
played
for
alma
had
no
profound
love
of
the
art
nothing
more
natural
than
her
laying
it
completely
aside
when
at
home
in
wales
she
missed
her
sufficient
audience
to
her
music
was
not
an
end
in
itself
like
numberless
girls
she
had
to
begin
with
a
certain
mechanical
aptitude
which
encouraged
her
through
the
earlier
stages
until
vanity
stepped
in
and
urged
her
to
considerable
attainments
her
genuine
delight
in
music
of
the
higher
kind
served
as
an
encouragement
whenever
her
own
energies
began
to
fail
and
when
at
length
with
advancing
social
prospects
the
thought
took
hold
of
her
that
by
means
of
her
violin
she
might
maintain
a
place
of
distinction
above
ordinary
handsome
girls
and
heiresses
it
sufficed
to
overcome
her
indolence
and
lack
of
the
true
temper
she
founded
her
quartet
society
and
queened
it
over
amateurs
some
of
whom
were
much
better
endowed
than
herself
having
set
her
pride
on
winning
praise
as
a
musician
of
course
she
took
pains
even
working
very
hard
from
time
to
time
she
had
teachers
and
was
clever
enough
to
profit
by
their
lessons
with
it
all
she
cared
as
little
for
music
as
ever
to
some
extent
it
had
lost
even
that
power
over
her
sensibilities
which
is
felt
by
the
average
hearer
alma
had
an
emotional
nature
but
her
emotions
responded
to
almost
any
kind
of
excitement
sooner
than
to
the
musical
so
much
had
she
pretended
and
posed
so
much
had
she
struggled
with
mere
manual
difficulties
so
much
lofty
cant
and
sounding
hollowness
had
she
talked
that
the
name
of
her
art
was
grown
a
weariness
a
disgust
conscious
of
this
she
was
irritated
whenever
harvey
begged
her
to
play
simple
things
for
indeed
if
she
must
hear
music
at
all
it
was
just
those
simple
melodies
she
would
herself
have
preferred
and
among
the
musical
people
with
whom
she
associated
were
few
if
any
in
whom
conceit
did
not
sound
the
leading
motive
she
knew
but
one
true
musician
herr
wilenski
that
the
virtuoso
took
no
trouble
to
bring
her
in
touch
with
his
own
chosen
circle
was
a
significant
fact
which
quite
escaped
alma
notice
between
the
pieces
redgrave
chatted
in
a
vein
of
seductive
familiarity
saying
nothing
that
dora
leach
might
not
have
heard
but
frequently
softening
his
voice
as
though
to
convey
intimate
meanings
his
manner
had
the
charm
of
variety
he
was
never
on
two
occasions
alike
today
he
seemed
to
relax
in
a
luxurious
mood
due
in
part
to
the
influence
of
sound
and
in
part
as
his
eyes
declared
to
the
sensuous
pleasure
of
sitting
by
alma
side
an
excellent
fellow
carnaby
is
he
remarked
unexpectedly
have
been
seeing
a
good
deal
of
him
lately
as
you
know
i
think
i
have
heard
like
him
all
the
better
because
i
am
rather
sorry
for
him
you
feel
that
he
is
very
much
out
of
place
he
does
belong
to
our
world
at
all
he
ought
to
be
founding
a
new
civilisation
in
some
wild
country
i
can
sympathise
with
him
i
have
something
of
the
same
spirit
never
observed
it
said
alma
allowing
her
glance
to
skim
his
features
because
you
yourself
represent
civilisation
in
its
subtlest
phase
and
when
i
am
with
you
i
naturally
think
only
of
that
i
say
i
should
have
thriven
as
a
backwoodsman
but
i
admire
the
type
in
carnaby
that
one
of
privileges
do
you
think
we
live
in
imagination
quite
as
much
as
in
everyday
existence
you
i
am
sure
are
in
sympathy
with
infinite
forms
of
life
and
he
added
just
above
his
breath
could
realise
so
many
of
them
shall
be
content
with
one
replied
alma
that
she
nodded
towards
the
concert
platform
where
at
the
same
moment
a
violinist
stepped
forward
redgrave
gazed
inquiringly
at
her
but
she
kept
silence
until
the
next
interval
then
in
reply
to
his
direct
question
she
told
him
with
brevity
what
her
purpose
was
he
showed
neither
surprise
nor
excessive
pleasure
but
bent
his
head
with
a
grave
approving
smile
you
feel
that
the
time
has
come
of
course
i
knew
that
it
would
are
any
details
arranged
or
perhaps
i
must
ask
wanted
to
talk
it
over
with
you
she
answered
graciously
after
the
concert
they
had
tea
together
redgrave
was
very
attentive
to
miss
leach
whom
his
talk
amused
and
flattered
alma
enterprise
was
discussed
with
pleasant
freedom
and
redgrave
learnt
that
she
had
decided
to
employ
felix
dymes
as
her
agent
the
trio
set
forth
at
length
on
their
homeward
journey
in
a
mood
of
delightful
animation
and
travelled
together
as
far
as
victoria
have
said
that
you
can
rely
on
me
for
all
possible
assistance
redgrave
remarked
as
he
walked
along
the
roaring
platform
by
side
is
a
matter
of
course
we
shall
meet
again
before
long
doubt
porchester
terrace
perhaps
alma
met
his
eyes
and
took
away
with
her
the
consciousness
of
having
dared
greatly
but
the
end
was
a
great
one
in
spite
of
the
bad
weather
frothingham
had
travelled
up
from
basingstoke
alma
found
her
in
the
and
saw
at
a
glance
that
there
had
been
conversation
on
certain
subjects
between
her
and
harvey
but
not
until
the
next
day
did
frothingham
speak
of
what
she
had
heard
and
make
her
private
comments
for
alma
benefit
thought
harvey
was
joking
dear
have
you
reflected
how
many
reasons
there
are
why
you
the
pathetic
gaze
of
appeal
produced
no
effect
harvey
ask
you
to
talk
about
it
mamma
he
takes
it
in
the
kindest
way
but
alma
you
surely
see
that
it
pains
him
him
that
shows
you
do
understand
us
dear
mamma
we
could
neither
of
us
possibly
do
anything
that
would
pain
the
other
we
are
in
perfect
harmony
yet
absolutely
independent
it
has
all
been
talked
over
and
settled
you
must
have
misunderstood
harvey
altogether
from
this
position
alma
could
not
be
moved
and
frothingham
too
discreet
to
incur
the
risk
of
interference
spoke
no
more
of
the
matter
as
it
concerned
man
and
wife
but
another
objection
she
urged
with
almost
tearful
earnestness
did
alma
forget
that
her
appearance
in
public
would
give
occasion
to
most
disagreeable
forms
of
gossip
and
even
if
she
disregarded
the
scandal
of
a
few
years
ago
would
not
many
of
her
acquaintances
say
and
believe
that
necessity
had
driven
her
into
a
professional
career
may
say
what
they
like
and
think
what
they
like
was
lofty
reply
artists
had
always
considered
such
trivial
difficulties
where
should
we
have
been
suppose
gossip
does
its
worst
it
all
over
in
a
few
months
then
i
stand
by
my
own
merit
dear
mamma
be
old
fashioned
you
look
so
young
and
so
charming
indeed
you
do
that
i
ca
bear
to
hear
you
talk
in
that
early
victorian
way
art
is
art
and
all
these
other
things
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
it
there
it
all
over
be
good
and
amuse
yourself
whilst
you
are
with
us
i
assure
you
we
are
the
most
reasonable
and
the
happiest
people
living
frothingham
smiled
at
the
compliment
to
herself
then
sighed
and
held
her
peace
chapter
so
day
by
day
alma
violin
sounded
and
day
after
day
harvey
heard
it
with
a
growing
impatience
as
is
commonly
the
case
with
people
of
untrained
ear
he
had
never
much
cared
for
this
instrument
he
preferred
the
piano
not
long
ago
he
would
have
thought
it
impossible
that
he
could
ever
come
to
dislike
music
which
throughout
his
life
had
been
to
him
a
solace
and
an
inspiration
but
now
he
began
to
shrink
from
the
sound
of
it
as
alma
practised
in
the
morning
he
was
driven
at
length
to
alter
his
habits
and
to
leave
home
after
breakfast
having
no
other
business
he
went
to
westminster
bridge
road
met
cecil
morphew
at
the
shop
watched
the
progress
of
alterations
that
seemed
advisable
picked
up
a
little
knowledge
of
photography
talked
over
prices
advertisements
and
numerous
commercial
matters
of
which
he
had
hitherto
been
contentedly
ignorant
before
long
his
loan
to
morphew
was
converted
into
an
investment
he
became
a
partner
in
the
concern
which
retaining
the
name
of
the
old
proprietor
they
carried
on
as
den
bow
co
the
redemption
of
his
debentures
kept
him
still
occupied
with
a
furtive
study
of
the
he
did
not
dare
to
face
risk
on
a
large
scale
the
mere
thought
of
a
great
reduction
of
income
made
him
tremble
and
perspire
so
in
the
end
he
adopted
the
simple
and
straightforward
expedient
of
seeking
an
interview
with
his
banker
by
whom
he
was
genially
counselled
to
purchase
stock
a
sound
security
but
less
productive
than
that
he
had
previously
held
an
unfortunate
necessity
seeing
that
his
expenses
increased
and
were
likely
to
do
so
but
he
tried
to
hope
that
westminster
bridge
road
would
eventually
reimburse
him
with
good
luck
it
might
do
more
his
days
of
quietude
were
over
he
too
was
being
drawn
into
the
whirlpool
no
more
dreaming
among
his
books
no
more
waking
to
the
ordinary
duties
and
cares
of
a
reasonable
life
as
a
natural
consequence
of
the
feeling
of
unsettlement
of
instability
he
had
recourse
more
often
than
he
wished
to
the
old
convivial
habits
gathering
about
him
once
again
at
club
or
restaurant
the
kind
of
society
in
which
he
always
felt
at
ease
good
careless
jovial
and
often
impecunious
fellows
who
as
in
days
gone
by
sometimes
made
a
demand
upon
his
purse
which
he
could
not
resist
though
he
had
now
such
cause
for
rigid
economy
was
it
that
he
grew
old
he
could
no
longer
take
his
wine
with
disregard
of
consequence
the
slightest
excess
and
too
surely
he
paid
for
it
on
the
morrow
not
merely
with
a
passing
headache
but
with
a
whole
day
miserable
discomfort
oh
degeneracy
of
stomach
and
of
brain
of
will
too
for
he
was
sure
to
repeat
the
foolish
experience
before
a
week
had
passed
it
was
not
till
frothingham
had
left
them
after
a
visit
that
he
reminded
alma
of
her
promise
to
go
with
him
to
gunnersbury
i
promise
she
said
thought
we
agreed
that
you
should
settle
all
that
yourself
had
rather
you
came
with
me
to
see
abbott
shall
it
be
saturday
replied
alma
with
a
shake
of
the
head
and
a
smile
have
to
see
mr
dymes
who
is
he
agent
very
well
then
i
go
alone
he
would
not
permit
himself
any
further
inquiry
alma
had
never
spoken
to
him
of
dymes
her
harvey
pictured
an
man
in
a
small
office
and
turned
from
the
thought
with
disgust
too
late
to
interpose
to
ask
questions
anything
of
that
kind
would
but
make
him
seem
small
ridiculous
fussy
he
had
chosen
his
course
and
must
pursue
it
not
that
alma
behaved
in
such
a
way
as
to
suggest
estrangement
anything
but
so
her
manner
was
always
amiable
frequently
affectionate
when
they
spent
an
evening
together
it
did
not
often
happen
she
talked
delightfully
avoiding
as
did
harvey
himself
the
subjects
on
which
they
were
not
likely
to
agree
her
gaze
had
all
the
old
directness
her
smile
was
sweet
as
ever
and
her
laugh
as
melodious
if
ever
he
felt
uneasy
during
her
long
absences
in
town
one
of
these
evenings
sufficed
to
reassure
him
alma
was
alma
still
and
could
he
but
have
reconciled
himself
to
the
thought
of
her
playing
in
public
she
would
have
been
yet
the
wife
he
chose
frankly
gallantly
independent
until
a
certain
day
at
the
end
of
march
when
something
happened
of
which
harvey
had
no
suspicion
but
which
affected
alma
in
a
way
he
soon
perceived
that
morning
he
had
left
home
early
and
would
not
return
till
late
alma
practised
as
usual
had
luncheon
alone
and
was
thinking
of
going
out
when
the
post
delivered
two
letters
one
for
herself
from
dymes
the
other
for
her
husband
a
glance
showed
her
that
correspondent
was
abbott
and
never
till
today
had
one
of
mrs
abbott
letters
come
into
her
hand
she
regarded
it
with
curiosity
and
the
longer
she
looked
the
stronger
her
curiosity
became
harvey
would
of
course
tell
her
what
his
friend
wrote
about
as
he
always
did
but
the
epistle
itself
she
would
not
be
asked
to
read
and
did
she
as
a
matter
of
fact
always
know
when
harvey
heard
from
abbott
a
foolish
question
probably
for
if
the
correspondence
were
meant
to
be
secret
it
would
be
addressed
to
harvey
at
his
club
not
to
the
house
all
the
same
a
desire
of
years
concentrated
itself
in
this
moment
alma
wished
vehemently
to
read
one
of
mary
abbott
letters
with
her
own
eyes
she
turned
the
envelope
it
was
of
very
stout
paper
and
did
not
look
quite
securely
gummed
would
not
a
touch
of
the
finger
almost
why
there
just
as
she
thought
a
mere
touch
and
the
envelope
came
open
if
i
ever
wrote
a
dangerous
word
mused
alma
i
do
and
never
shall
this
would
be
a
lesson
to
me
well
it
was
open
and
naturally
enough
the
letter
came
forth
what
harm
there
could
be
nothing
in
it
that
harvey
would
wish
to
hide
from
her
so
with
hands
that
trembled
and
cheeks
that
felt
warm
she
began
to
read
the
letter
was
abbott
acknowledgment
of
the
quarterly
cheque
she
received
from
rolfe
alma
was
surprised
at
the
mention
of
money
in
the
first
line
and
read
eagerly
on
as
mary
abbott
and
her
friend
had
seen
each
other
so
recently
there
was
no
need
of
a
full
report
concerning
minnie
wager
her
brother
had
long
since
gone
to
a
but
the
wording
allowed
it
to
be
understood
that
harvey
paid
for
the
child
and
what
was
more
that
he
held
himself
responsible
for
her
future
what
could
this
mean
alma
pondered
it
in
astonishment
gratified
by
the
discovery
but
disturbed
beyond
measure
by
its
mysterious
suggestiveness
the
letter
contained
little
more
merely
saying
towards
the
end
how
very
glad
the
writer
would
be
to
give
her
utmost
care
to
little
hugh
when
presently
he
came
into
her
hands
last
of
all
remember
me
kindly
to
mrs
rolfe
at
this
point
of
her
life
alma
had
become
habitually
suspicious
of
any
relation
between
man
and
woman
which
might
suggest
however
remotely
dubious
possibilities
innocence
appeared
to
her
the
exception
lawlessness
the
rule
where
man
and
woman
were
restrained
by
no
obvious
barriers
it
was
the
natural
result
of
her
experience
of
her
companionship
of
the
thoughts
she
deliberately
fostered
having
read
the
letter
twice
having
mused
upon
it
she
leaped
to
a
conclusion
which
seemed
to
explain
completely
the
peculiar
intimacy
subsisting
between
harvey
and
mary
abbott
these
two
children
known
as
albert
and
minnie
wager
were
harvey
offspring
the
result
of
some
before
his
marriage
and
abbott
taking
charge
of
them
for
payment
had
connived
at
the
story
of
their
origin
of
their
pitiful
desertion
what
could
be
clearer
she
did
not
go
further
in
luminous
conjectures
even
with
her
present
mind
alma
could
not
conceive
of
mary
abbott
as
a
wanton
of
harvey
rolfe
as
a
shameless
intriguer
but
it
stung
her
keenly
to
think
that
for
years
there
had
been
this
secret
between
them
probably
the
matter
was
known
to
abbott
husband
and
so
at
his
death
it
had
somehow
become
possible
for
harvey
to
suggest
this
arrangement
whereby
he
helped
the
widow
in
her
misfortunes
and
provided
conscientiously
for
his
own
illegitimate
children
harvey
was
so
very
conscientious
about
children
did
they
resemble
him
she
had
seen
the
little
girl
but
only
once
and
without
attention
she
would
take
an
early
opportunity
of
going
over
to
gunnersbury
to
observe
but
no
such
evidence
was
necessary
the
facts
stared
one
in
the
face
that
harvey
should
have
kept
this
secret
from
her
was
intelligible
enough
most
men
no
doubt
would
have
done
the
same
but
it
seemed
to
alma
only
another
proof
of
her
husband
inability
to
appreciate
her
he
had
no
faith
in
her
as
artist
he
had
no
faith
in
her
as
woman
had
she
not
felt
this
even
from
the
very
beginning
of
their
intimate
acquaintance
perhaps
the
first
thing
that
awakened
her
interest
in
harvey
rolfe
was
the
perception
that
he
did
not
like
other
men
admire
her
unreservedly
that
he
regarded
her
with
something
of
criticism
she
could
attract
him
she
could
play
upon
his
senses
yet
he
remained
critical
this
together
with
certain
characteristics
which
distinguished
him
from
the
ordinary
man
suggestions
of
force
and
individuality
drew
her
into
singular
relations
with
him
long
before
she
dreamt
that
he
would
become
her
husband
and
his
attitude
towards
her
was
unchanged
spite
of
passionate
spite
of
the
tenderness
and
familiarity
of
marriage
still
he
viewed
her
with
eyes
of
tolerance
rather
than
of
admiration
he
compared
contrasted
her
with
mary
abbott
for
whose
intellect
and
character
he
had
a
sincere
respect
doubtless
he
fancied
that
if
this
secret
became
known
to
her
she
would
sulk
or
storm
after
the
manner
of
ordinary
wives
what
made
him
so
blind
to
her
great
qualities
was
it
that
he
had
never
truly
loved
her
had
it
been
owing
to
mere
chance
mere
drift
of
circumstances
that
he
offered
her
marriage
instead
of
throwing
out
a
proposal
such
as
that
of
cyrus
redgrave
at
bregenz
though
but
darkly
confusedly
intermittently
conscious
of
the
feeling
alma
was
at
heart
dissatisfied
with
the
liberty
the
independence
which
her
husband
seemed
so
willing
to
allow
her
this
again
helped
to
confirm
the
impression
that
harvey
held
her
in
small
esteem
he
did
not
think
it
worth
while
to
oppose
her
she
might
go
her
frivolous
way
and
he
would
watch
with
careless
amusement
at
moments
it
was
true
he
appeared
on
the
point
of
once
or
twice
she
had
thought
perhaps
had
hoped
that
he
could
lay
down
the
law
in
masculine
fashion
but
no
he
laughed
and
it
was
over
when
at
the
time
of
her
misery
in
wales
her
dim
jealousy
of
abbott
and
revolt
against
the
prospect
of
a
second
motherhood
she
had
subdued
herself
before
him
spoken
and
behaved
like
an
everyday
dutiful
wife
harvey
would
have
none
of
it
he
wished
was
that
the
reason
to
be
left
alone
not
to
be
worried
with
her
dependence
upon
him
that
no
doubt
of
her
fidelity
ever
seemed
to
enter
his
mind
was
capable
of
anything
but
a
complimentary
interpretation
he
simply
took
it
for
granted
that
she
would
be
faithful
in
other
words
that
she
had
not
spirit
or
originality
enough
to
defy
conventional
laws
to
himself
perhaps
he
reserved
a
much
larger
liberty
how
could
she
tell
where
in
what
company
his
evenings
were
spent
more
than
once
he
had
been
away
from
home
all
night
missed
the
last
train
he
said
well
it
was
nothing
to
her
but
his
incuriousness
as
to
her
own
movements
began
to
affect
her
sensibly
now
that
she
imagined
so
close
a
community
of
thoughts
and
interests
between
harvey
and
mary
abbott
before
his
return
tonight
other
letters
had
arrived
for
him
and
all
lay
together
as
usual
upon
his
desk
alma
trying
to
wear
her
customary
face
waited
for
him
to
mention
that
he
had
heard
from
gunnersbury
but
harvey
said
nothing
he
talked
instead
of
a
letter
from
basil
morton
who
wanted
him
to
go
to
greystone
in
the
spring
with
wife
and
child
must
count
on
me
said
alma
after
your
concert
recital
whatever
you
call
it
it
would
be
a
good
rest
i
shall
be
busier
than
ever
dymes
hopes
to
arrange
for
me
at
several
of
the
large
towns
harvey
smiled
and
alma
observed
him
with
irritation
she
could
scarcely
repress
of
course
his
smile
meant
a
civil
scepticism
he
asked
dymes
the
comic
opera
man
i
rather
wondered
harvey
whether
you
would
awake
to
that
fact
he
will
be
one
of
our
greatest
composers
she
went
on
with
enthusiasm
purposely
exaggerating
dymes
merits
and
professing
a
warm
personal
regard
for
him
in
the
end
harvey
eye
was
upon
her
still
smiling
but
curiously
observant
has
he
been
here
does
he
think
it
odd
that
you
never
ask
him
you
know
that
i
do
care
to
ask
people
they
are
aware
she
laughed
my
husband
is
not
musical
harvey
countenance
changed
you
mean
that
you
tell
them
so
in
any
disagreeable
way
of
course
it
so
natural
now
for
married
people
to
have
each
their
own
world
it
is
he
acquiesced
alma
would
have
gone
to
gunnersbury
the
very
next
day
but
she
feared
to
excite
some
suspicion
in
her
husband
mind
he
little
imagined
her
capable
of
opening
his
letters
and
to
be
detected
in
such
a
squalid
misdemeanour
would
have
overwhelmed
her
with
shame
in
a
day
or
two
she
would
be
going
to
rayner
mann
to
meet
a
certain
musical
critic
great
influence
and
by
leaving
home
early
she
could
contrive
to
make
a
call
upon
abbott
before
lunching
at
putney
this
she
did
she
saw
little
minnie
wager
scrutinised
the
child
features
and
had
no
difficulty
whatever
in
discerning
harvey
eyes
harvey
mouth
why
should
she
have
troubled
herself
to
come
it
was
very
hard
to
control
her
indignation
if
abbott
thought
her
rather
strange
rather
abrupt
what
did
it
matter
at
rayner
mann
she
passed
into
a
soothing
and
delicious
atmosphere
the
influential
critic
proved
to
be
a
very
young
man
at
most
he
stammered
with
nervousness
when
first
addressing
the
stranger
but
soon
gave
her
to
understand
more
or
less
humorously
that
his
weekly
article
was
the
most
important
thing
in
musical
criticism
and
that
he
panted
for
the
opportunity
of
hearing
a
new
violinist
of
real
promise
but
alma
had
not
brought
her
violin
lest
she
should
make
herself
cheap
she
never
played
now
at
people
houses
the
critic
had
to
be
satisfied
with
hearing
her
talk
and
gazing
upon
her
beauty
alma
was
become
a
very
fluent
talker
and
her
voice
had
the
quality
which
fixes
attention
at
luncheon
whilst
persons
lent
willing
ear
she
compared
sarasate
playing
of
beethoven
concerto
with
that
of
joachim
and
declared
that
sarasate
in
the
first
movement
though
marvellous
for
technical
skill
was
not
at
all
in
the
spirit
of
the
work
the
influential
writer
applauded
drawing
her
on
to
fresh
displays
of
learning
taste
eloquence
she
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
somebody
of
the
left
hand
of
somebody
effects
of
a
certain
pianist
of
touch
it
was
a
truly
musical
gathering
each
person
at
table
had
some
exquisite
phrase
to
contribute
the
hostess
who
played
no
instrument
but
doted
upon
all
was
of
opinion
that
an
executant
should
at
mirroring
his
own
nature
in
his
interpretation
of
a
whereupon
another
lady
threw
out
remarks
on
interpretation
confessing
her
preference
for
a
method
purely
the
influential
critic
began
to
talk
about
liszt
with
whom
he
declared
that
he
had
been
on
intimate
terms
he
grew
fervent
over
the
master
rhapsodies
with
their
rhythm
and
dithyrambic
fury
do
know
when
i
enjoyed
myself
so
much
said
alma
gaily
as
the
great
young
man
pressed
her
hand
at
parting
and
avowed
himself
her
devoted
admirer
dear
rolfe
said
the
hostess
privately
were
simply
brilliant
we
are
all
looking
forward
so
eagerly
and
as
soon
as
alma
was
gone
the
amiable
lady
talked
about
her
to
the
one
remaining
guest
she
delightful
i
do
so
hope
she
will
be
a
success
i
afraid
so
much
depends
upon
it
of
course
you
know
that
she
is
the
daughter
of
bennet
frothingham
did
you
know
yes
and
left
without
a
farthing
i
suppose
it
was
natural
she
should
catch
at
an
offer
of
marriage
poor
girl
but
it
seems
to
have
been
one
never
sees
her
husband
and
i
afraid
he
is
anything
but
kind
to
her
he
have
calculated
on
her
chances
as
a
musician
i
am
told
they
have
little
or
nothing
to
depend
upon
do
drum
up
your
friends
will
you
it
is
to
be
at
prince
hall
on
may
the
i
think
i
feel
do
you
know
personally
responsible
she
would
never
have
come
out
but
for
my
persuasion
and
i
so
anxious
for
a
success
the
day
drew
near
for
ada
wellington
debut
alma
met
this
young
lady
but
they
did
not
take
to
each
other
miss
wellington
was
a
trifle
and
unless
alma
mistook
felt
fiercely
jealous
of
any
one
admired
by
felix
dymes
as
she
could
not
entertain
at
their
own
house
somewhere
not
far
south
of
the
thames
wellington
borrowed
dymes
flat
for
an
afternoon
and
there
supported
by
the
distinguished
composer
received
a
strange
medley
of
people
who
interested
themselves
in
her
daughter
venture
alma
laughed
at
the
arrangement
and
asked
dymes
if
he
expected
her
congratulations
make
fun
of
them
said
felix
course
they
not
sort
alma
but
i
known
them
all
my
life
and
old
wellington
did
me
more
than
one
good
turn
when
i
was
a
youngster
ada
wo
make
much
of
it
but
she
squeeze
in
among
the
provincial
pros
after
this
send
off
really
are
capable
of
generosity
asked
alma
swear
there
nothing
between
us
there
only
one
woman
living
that
i
have
eyes
for
and
i
afraid
she
does
care
a
rap
about
me
at
all
events
she
treats
me
rather
badly
this
dialogue
took
place
in
a
the
evening
before
miss
wellington
day
alma
had
declined
to
meet
her
agent
a
second
time
at
the
apollo
theatre
they
saw
each
other
by
arrangement
at
this
and
that
house
of
common
friends
and
corresponded
freely
by
post
letters
always
being
couched
in
irreproachable
phrase
whenever
the
thing
was
possible
he
undisguisedly
made
love
and
alma
bore
with
it
for
the
sake
of
his
services
he
had
obtained
promises
from
four
musicians
of
repute
to
take
part
in
alma
concert
and
declared
that
the
terms
they
asked
were
lower
than
usual
owing
to
their
regard
for
him
the
expenses
of
the
recital
without
allowing
for
advertisements
would
amount
to
seventy
or
eighty
pounds
and
dymes
guaranteed
that
the
hall
should
produce
at
least
that
alma
ashamed
to
appear
uneasy
about
such
paltry
sums
always
talked
as
though
outlay
mattered
nothing
stint
on
advertisements
she
said
fear
leave
that
to
me
answered
felix
with
a
smile
of
infinite
meaning
ada
wellington
could
not
afford
to
risk
much
money
and
alma
thought
her
announcements
in
the
papers
worth
nothing
at
all
however
the
pianist
was
fairly
successful
a
tolerable
audience
was
scraped
together
at
steinway
hall
and
press
notices
of
a
complimentary
flavour
though
brief
appeared
in
several
quarters
with
keen
anxiety
alma
followed
every
detail
she
said
to
herself
that
if
appearance
in
public
made
no
more
noise
than
this
she
would
be
ready
to
die
of
mortification
there
remained
a
fortnight
before
the
ordeal
had
they
not
better
begin
to
advertise
at
once
thus
she
wrote
to
dymes
who
replied
by
sending
her
three
newspapers
in
each
of
which
a
paragraph
of
musical
gossip
informed
the
world
that
harvey
rolfe
was
about
to
give
her
first
public
violin
recital
at
prince
hall
rolfe
added
the
journalists
in
varying
phrase
was
already
well
known
to
the
best
musical
circles
as
an
amateur
violinist
and
great
interest
attached
to
her
appearance
in
public
a
step
on
which
she
had
decided
only
after
much
persuasion
of
friends
and
admirers
already
there
was
considerable
demand
for
tickets
and
the
audience
would
most
certainly
be
both
large
and
distinguished
alma
laughed
with
delight
the
same
day
by
a
later
post
she
received
a
copy
of
a
journal
addressed
in
a
hand
unknown
to
her
guided
by
a
red
pencil
mark
she
became
aware
of
no
less
than
a
quarter
of
a
column
devoted
to
herself
from
this
she
might
learn
if
she
did
not
already
know
it
that
harvey
rolfe
was
a
lady
of
the
utmost
personal
and
social
charm
that
her
beauty
was
not
easily
described
without
the
use
of
terms
that
would
sound
extravagant
that
as
a
violinist
she
had
stood
for
a
year
or
two
amid
lady
amateurs
that
she
had
till
of
late
lived
in
romantic
seclusion
the
noblest
scenery
of
north
wales
for
the
sole
purpose
of
devoting
herself
to
music
and
that
only
with
the
greatest
reluctance
had
she
consented
to
make
known
to
the
public
a
talent
nay
a
genius
which
assuredly
was
for
mankind
she
was
the
favourite
pupil
of
that
admirable
virtuoso
herr
wilenski
at
prince
hall
on
the
sixteenth
of
may
all
lovers
of
music
would
have
c
this
batch
of
newspapers
alma
laid
before
dinner
on
harvey
desk
and
about
an
hour
after
the
meal
she
entered
the
library
her
husband
smoking
and
meditating
looked
up
constrainedly
have
read
them
he
remarked
in
a
dry
tone
alma
coldness
during
the
last
few
weeks
he
had
explained
to
himself
as
the
result
of
his
failure
to
take
interest
in
her
proceedings
he
knew
that
this
behaviour
on
his
part
was
quite
illogical
alma
acted
with
full
permission
and
he
had
no
right
whatever
to
just
because
he
disliked
what
she
was
doing
only
today
he
had
rebuked
himself
and
meant
to
make
an
effort
to
restore
goodwill
between
them
but
these
newspaper
paragraphs
disgusted
him
he
could
not
speak
as
he
wished
is
your
agent
doing
i
suppose
course
that
is
his
business
i
wo
say
anything
about
it
if
are
satisfied
i
have
no
right
to
complain
i
do
think
you
have
replied
alma
putting
severe
restraint
upon
herself
to
speak
calmly
thereupon
she
left
the
room
harvey
rose
to
follow
her
he
took
a
step
forward
stood
still
returned
to
his
chair
and
they
did
not
see
each
other
again
that
night
in
the
morning
came
a
letter
from
dymes
he
wrote
that
a
certain
newspaper
wished
for
an
with
rolfe
to
be
published
next
week
should
the
interviewer
call
upon
her
and
if
so
when
moreover
an
illustrated
paper
wanted
her
portrait
with
the
least
possible
delay
were
her
new
photographs
ready
if
so
would
she
send
him
a
dozen
better
still
if
he
could
see
her
today
for
he
had
important
things
to
speak
of
might
he
look
for
her
at
littlestone
at
about
four
at
breakfast
alma
was
chatty
but
she
directed
her
talk
almost
exclusively
to
pauline
smith
and
to
little
hugh
who
now
had
his
place
at
table
a
merry
little
fellow
dressed
in
a
sailor
suit
harvey
also
talked
a
good
deal
he
too
with
pauline
and
the
child
when
alma
rose
he
followed
her
and
asked
her
to
come
into
the
library
for
a
moment
a
curmudgeon
he
began
facing
her
with
nervous
abruptness
me
for
that
foolery
last
night
will
you
course
alma
replied
distantly
but
in
the
same
spirit
alma
i
an
ass
i
know
that
if
you
do
this
thing
at
all
you
must
do
it
in
the
usual
way
i
wish
you
success
heartily
and
i
read
with
pleasure
every
scrap
of
print
that
praises
you
hurrying
to
town
harvey
i
have
to
go
to
the
photographer
and
see
dymes
and
all
sorts
of
things
photographer
i
hope
they
be
tolerable
i
know
they
wo
do
you
justice
will
you
sit
to
a
painter
if
i
arrange
it
unfortunately
i
ca
afford
millais
you
know
but
i
want
a
good
picture
of
you
talk
about
it
she
replied
smiling
more
pleasantly
than
of
late
i
really
have
time
now
you
forgive
me
my
idiotics
she
nodded
and
was
gone
in
the
afternoon
she
met
dymes
at
littlestone
a
house
of
much
society
for
the
most
part
theatrical
when
they
had
moved
aside
for
private
talk
he
began
by
asking
a
brusque
question
got
that
notice
for
you
into
the
did
you
nothing
about
it
come
who
was
it
have
no
idea
i
took
it
for
granted
here
alma
i
think
i
not
doing
badly
for
you
and
the
least
you
can
do
is
to
be
straight
with
me
alma
raised
her
head
with
a
quick
circuitous
glance
then
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
man
heated
face
and
spoke
in
an
undertone
behave
yourself
or
i
shall
have
to
go
away
you
wo
tell
me
very
well
i
chuck
up
the
job
you
can
run
the
show
yourself
alma
had
never
looked
for
delicacy
in
felix
dymes
and
his
motives
had
from
the
first
been
legible
to
her
but
this
revelation
of
brutality
went
beyond
anything
for
which
she
was
prepared
as
she
saw
the
man
move
away
a
feeling
of
helplessness
and
of
dread
overcame
her
anger
she
could
not
do
without
him
the
only
other
man
active
on
her
behalf
was
cyrus
redgrave
and
to
seek
redgrave
help
at
such
a
juncture
with
the
explanation
that
must
necessarily
be
given
would
mean
abandonment
of
her
last
scruple
of
course
the
paragraph
in
the
originated
with
him
since
dymes
knew
nothing
about
it
it
could
have
no
other
source
slowly
but
very
completely
the
man
of
wealth
and
social
influence
had
drawn
his
nets
about
her
at
each
meeting
with
him
she
felt
more
perilously
compromised
her
airs
of
command
served
merely
to
disguise
defeat
in
the
contest
she
had
recklessly
challenged
thrown
upon
herself
she
feared
redgrave
shrank
from
the
thought
of
seeing
him
not
that
he
had
touched
her
heart
or
beguiled
her
senses
she
hated
him
for
his
success
in
the
calculated
scheme
to
which
she
had
consciously
yielded
step
by
step
but
she
was
brought
to
the
point
of
regarding
him
as
inseparable
from
her
ambitious
hopes
till
quite
recently
her
thought
had
been
that
after
using
him
to
secure
a
successful
debut
she
could
wave
him
off
perhaps
tell
him
in
plain
words
with
a
smile
of
scorn
that
they
were
quits
she
now
distrusted
her
power
to
stand
alone
to
the
hostility
of
such
a
man
as
dymes
certain
save
at
intolerable
cost
she
must
be
able
to
oppose
a
higher
influence
between
dymes
and
redgrave
there
was
no
hesitating
on
whatever
score
this
advertisement
in
the
fashionable
and
authoritative
weekly
paper
surpassed
dymes
scope
his
savage
jealousy
was
sufficient
proof
of
that
all
she
could
do
for
the
moment
was
to
temporise
with
her
ignobler
master
and
the
humiliation
of
such
a
necessity
seemed
to
poison
her
blood
she
rose
talked
a
little
of
she
knew
not
what
with
she
knew
not
whom
and
moved
towards
the
hostess
by
whom
her
enemy
was
sitting
a
glance
sufficed
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
leave
dymes
followed
her
he
came
up
to
her
side
at
a
few
yards
from
the
house
and
they
walked
together
without
speaking
until
alma
turned
into
the
first
quiet
street
give
you
my
word
she
began
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
that
paper
believe
you
and
i
sorry
i
made
a
row
dymes
replied
no
harm
done
i
dare
say
i
shall
be
hearing
more
about
it
have
some
photographs
here
said
alma
touching
her
sealskin
bag
you
take
them
but
there
a
whole
lot
of
things
to
be
arranged
we
talk
here
let
go
to
my
rooms
he
spoke
as
though
nothing
were
more
natural
alma
the
blood
throbbing
at
her
temples
saw
him
beckon
a
crawling
hansom
ca
come
now
i
have
a
dreadful
headache
only
want
to
be
quiet
come
along
the
hansom
had
pulled
up
alma
ashamed
to
resist
under
the
eyes
of
the
driver
stepped
in
and
her
companion
placed
himself
at
her
side
as
soon
as
they
drove
away
he
caught
her
hand
and
held
it
tightly
ca
go
to
your
rooms
said
alma
after
a
useless
resistance
head
is
terrible
tell
me
whatever
you
have
to
say
and
then
take
me
to
baker
street
station
i
see
you
again
in
a
day
or
two
she
did
not
feign
the
headache
it
had
been
coming
on
since
she
left
home
and
was
now
so
severe
that
her
eyes
closed
under
the
torture
of
the
daylight
little
rest
and
you
be
all
right
said
dymes
five
minutes
more
would
bring
them
to
their
destination
alma
pulled
away
her
hand
violently
you
do
stop
him
i
shall
mean
it
as
you
please
you
know
what
i
alma
raised
herself
drew
the
cabman
attention
and
bade
him
drive
to
baker
street
there
was
a
short
silence
dymes
glaring
and
muttering
inarticulately
course
if
you
really
have
a
bad
headache
he
growled
at
length
i
have
and
you
treat
me
very
unkindly
it
alma
do
speak
like
that
as
if
i
be
unkind
to
you
he
secured
her
hand
again
and
she
did
not
resist
then
they
talked
of
business
settled
one
or
two
matters
appointed
another
meeting
as
they
drew
near
to
the
station
alma
spoke
impulsively
with
a
bewildered
look
should
wonder
if
i
give
it
up
after
all
was
her
companion
amazed
exclamation
might
i
wo
answer
for
it
and
it
would
be
your
fault
stricken
with
alarm
dymes
poured
forth
assurances
of
his
good
behaviour
he
followed
her
down
to
the
platform
and
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
had
to
listen
in
torment
of
mind
and
body
to
remonstrances
flatteries
amorous
blandishments
accompanied
by
the
hiss
of
steam
and
the
roar
of
trains
on
reaching
home
she
could
do
nothing
but
lie
down
in
the
dark
her
head
ached
intolerably
and
hour
after
hour
as
often
happens
when
the
brain
is
a
strain
of
music
hummed
incessantly
on
her
ear
till
inability
to
dismiss
it
made
her
cry
in
wretchedness
with
sleep
she
recovered
but
through
the
next
day
dull
and
idle
her
thoughts
kept
such
a
gloomy
colour
that
she
brought
herself
to
the
resolve
with
which
she
had
threatened
felix
dymes
but
for
the
anticipation
of
harvey
triumph
she
might
perhaps
have
done
so
chapter
for
several
days
she
had
not
touched
the
violin
there
was
no
time
for
it
correspondence
engagements
intrigues
whirled
her
through
the
waking
hours
and
agitated
her
repose
the
newspaper
paragraphs
resulted
in
a
shower
of
letters
inquiring
congratulating
offering
good
wishes
and
all
had
to
be
courteously
answered
lest
the
writers
should
take
offence
invitations
to
luncheon
to
dinner
to
midnight
homes
came
thick
and
fast
if
all
this
resulted
from
a
few
preliminary
what
alma
asked
herself
would
be
the
consequence
of
an
actual
success
how
did
the
really
popular
musicians
contrive
to
get
an
hour
a
day
for
the
serious
study
of
their
art
her
severe
headache
had
left
behind
it
some
nervous
disorder
not
to
be
shaken
off
by
any
effort
a
new
distress
peculiarly
irritating
to
one
who
had
always
enjoyed
good
health
when
she
wrote
her
hand
was
unsteady
and
sometimes
her
eyes
dazzled
this
would
be
alarming
if
it
went
on
much
longer
the
day
approached
the
great
day
the
day
of
fate
and
what
hope
was
there
for
a
violinist
who
could
not
steady
her
hand
the
called
and
chatted
for
half
an
hour
and
took
his
leave
with
a
flourish
of
compliments
the
musicians
engaged
to
play
with
her
at
prince
hall
came
down
to
try
over
pieces
a
trio
a
duet
so
that
at
last
she
was
obliged
to
take
up
her
instrument
with
results
that
did
not
reassure
her
she
explained
that
she
was
not
feeling
quite
herself
it
was
nothing
it
would
pass
in
a
day
or
two
sibyl
carnaby
had
asked
her
and
harvey
to
dine
next
week
to
meet
several
people
rayner
mann
had
arranged
a
dinner
for
another
evening
and
now
strangeways
whom
she
had
not
seen
for
some
weeks
sent
an
urgent
request
that
she
would
call
in
porchester
terrace
as
soon
as
possible
to
speak
of
something
important
this
summons
alma
durst
not
disregard
between
strangeways
and
cyrus
redgrave
subsisted
an
intimacy
which
caused
her
frequent
uneasiness
it
would
not
have
surprised
her
to
discover
that
this
officious
friend
knew
of
all
her
recent
meetings
with
redgrave
at
the
crystal
palace
and
elsewhere
and
but
for
her
innocence
she
would
have
felt
herself
at
the
woman
mercy
that
she
had
not
transgressed
and
was
in
no
danger
of
transgressing
enabled
her
to
move
with
head
erect
among
the
things
unspeakable
which
always
seemed
to
her
to
be
lurking
in
the
shadowed
corners
of
strangeways
house
the
day
was
coming
when
she
might
hope
to
terminate
so
undesirable
an
acquaintance
but
for
the
present
she
must
show
a
friendly
face
she
made
this
call
at
three
and
was
received
in
that
boudoir
which
by
its
atmosphere
invariably
turned
her
thoughts
to
evil
the
hostess
rose
languidly
with
a
pallid
look
of
illness
my
neuralgic
something
or
other
she
said
in
reply
to
a
sympathetic
inquiry
the
price
one
pays
for
civilisation
had
two
terrible
days
and
nights
but
it
over
for
the
present
but
for
that
i
should
have
written
to
you
before
why
do
look
quite
so
well
as
usual
be
careful
do
be
careful
mean
to
be
if
people
will
let
me
have
eight
days
have
you
yes
just
eight
days
you
ought
to
keep
as
quiet
as
possible
we
are
all
doing
our
best
but
after
all
success
depends
greatly
upon
yourself
you
know
the
voice
as
always
seemed
to
fondle
her
but
alma
ear
detected
the
usual
insincerity
strangeways
spoke
in
much
the
same
way
to
numbers
of
people
yet
not
quite
so
caressingly
some
interest
she
undoubtedly
had
to
serve
by
this
consistent
display
of
affection
and
with
all
but
certainty
alma
divined
it
she
shrank
from
the
woman
it
cost
her
an
unceasing
effort
not
to
betray
dislike
or
even
hostility
course
you
saw
last
week
pursued
the
hostess
smiling
know
whose
doing
that
was
only
guessed
that
it
be
redgrave
kindness
have
the
same
suspicion
he
was
here
the
other
day
we
talked
about
you
you
have
seen
him
since
then
hinted
to
me
just
a
little
anxiety
i
hardly
know
whether
i
ought
to
speak
of
it
alma
looked
an
interrogation
as
unconcerned
as
she
could
make
it
but
did
not
open
her
lips
was
with
reference
to
your
man
of
business
it
seems
he
has
heard
something
i
really
do
know
what
not
quite
favourable
to
dymes
i
shall
not
offend
you
dear
do
take
offence
strangeways
alma
answered
with
a
slight
laugh
to
cover
her
uneasiness
so
the
hostess
uttered
a
thin
trill
of
merriment
is
always
safe
with
people
who
have
humour
dear
it
make
life
easier
does
it
oh
the
terrible
persons
who
take
everything
with
tragic
airs
well
there
not
a
bit
of
harm
in
it
between
ourselves
it
struck
me
that
our
friend
was
just
a
little
inclined
to
be
yes
you
understand
afraid
i
do
hate
the
word
well
just
a
trifle
jealous
alma
leaned
back
in
her
chair
glanced
about
her
and
said
nothing
course
he
would
never
allow
to
suspect
anything
of
the
kind
it
will
make
no
difference
you
can
count
upon
his
utmost
efforts
but
when
one
thinks
how
very
much
he
has
it
in
his
power
to
do
that
bit
of
writing
in
the
you
know
only
the
highest
influence
can
command
that
kind
of
thing
the
ca
be
bought
i
assure
you
and
one
has
to
think
of
the
future
a
good
beginning
is
much
but
how
many
musicians
are
able
to
follow
it
up
my
dear
alma
let
me
implore
you
not
to
imagine
that
you
will
be
able
to
dispense
with
this
kind
of
help
you
mean
that
redgrave
is
likely
to
withdraw
it
for
me
to
say
dear
i
am
only
telling
you
how
his
conversation
struck
me
he
appeared
to
think
to
be
apprehensive
that
you
might
in
future
look
to
dymes
rather
than
to
him
of
course
i
could
say
nothing
i
would
not
venture
a
syllable
course
not
alma
murmured
mechanically
her
eyes
wandering
you
likely
i
wonder
to
see
him
in
the
next
few
days
hardly
know
i
think
not
let
me
will
you
let
me
contrive
a
meeting
here
loathing
herself
and
burning
with
hatred
of
the
woman
in
whose
hands
she
felt
powerless
alma
gave
an
assenting
nod
am
sure
it
will
be
a
measure
of
prudence
dear
i
thought
possibly
you
might
be
seeing
him
at
carnaby
he
is
there
sometimes
i
believe
alma
looked
at
the
speaker
detecting
some
special
significance
in
her
inquiry
she
replied
that
redgrave
of
course
called
upon
carnaby
but
not
often
she
thought
threw
out
strangeways
fancied
he
was
there
a
good
deal
i
do
quite
know
why
you
met
him
there
it
quite
a
long
time
since
i
called
one
has
so
many
people
to
see
alma
knew
that
sibyl
was
now
holding
aloof
from
strangeways
and
it
seemed
not
improbable
that
this
had
excited
some
in
the
latter
but
her
own
uneasiness
regarding
sibyl
relations
with
redgrave
uneasiness
never
quite
subdued
made
her
quick
to
note
and
eager
to
explore
any
seeming
suspicion
on
that
subject
in
mind
strangeways
was
a
lover
of
scandal
a
dangerous
woman
unworthy
of
confidence
in
any
matter
whatsoever
common
prudence
to
say
nothing
of
loyalty
to
a
friend
bade
alma
keep
silence
but
the
smile
was
fixed
upon
her
hints
continued
to
fall
upon
her
ear
and
an
evil
fascination
at
length
compelled
her
to
speak
know
she
said
as
if
mentioning
an
unimportant
piece
of
news
redgrave
has
joined
carnaby
in
business
the
listener
face
exhibited
a
surprise
of
which
there
was
no
mistaking
the
sincerity
her
very
features
seemed
to
undergo
a
change
as
the
smile
vanished
from
them
they
became
on
the
instant
hard
and
old
lined
with
sudden
wrinkles
the
muscles
tense
every
line
expressive
of
fierce
vigilance
business
what
business
i
thought
you
would
have
heard
of
it
perhaps
redgrave
care
to
have
it
known
dear
i
am
discretion
itself
everything
was
told
down
to
the
last
detail
of
which
alma
had
any
knowledge
as
she
listened
and
questioned
strangeways
resumed
her
smiling
manner
but
could
not
regain
the
perfect
with
which
she
had
hitherto
gossiped
that
she
attached
great
importance
to
this
news
was
evident
and
the
fact
of
its
being
news
to
her
brought
fresh
trouble
into
alma
thoughts
very
interesting
exclaimed
strangeways
at
length
instance
of
redgrave
kindness
to
his
friends
of
course
it
was
done
purely
out
of
kindness
and
that
is
why
he
does
speak
of
it
quite
amusing
is
it
to
think
of
him
as
partner
in
a
business
of
that
kind
i
wonder
whether
she
broke
off
with
a
musing
air
were
you
wondering
asked
alma
whose
agitation
increased
every
moment
though
the
seeming
tendency
of
her
companion
words
was
to
allay
every
doubt
only
whether
it
was
carnaby
who
first
made
known
his
difficulties
am
told
so
carnaby
yes
no
doubt
it
was
so
i
do
think
carnaby
could
quite
have
i
mean
she
is
a
little
reserved
do
you
think
she
would
hardly
have
spoken
about
it
to
to
a
comparative
stranger
redgrave
ca
be
called
a
stranger
said
alma
have
been
friends
for
a
long
time
surely
you
know
that
in
sense
the
word
has
such
different
meanings
you
and
redgrave
are
friends
but
i
do
think
you
would
care
to
tell
him
if
your
husband
were
in
difficulties
of
that
kind
would
you
sibyl
carnaby
did
tell
him
replied
alma
with
nervous
vehemence
no
we
take
that
for
granted
i
do
think
carnaby
is
the
kind
of
man
kind
of
man
hardly
know
him
we
have
met
that
all
but
i
should
fancy
he
would
care
to
know
that
his
wife
talked
about
such
things
to
mr
redgrave
or
any
one
else
there
men
her
voice
sank
and
the
persistent
smile
became
little
better
than
an
ugly
grin
men
who
do
mind
it
one
hears
stories
i
should
like
to
repeat
to
you
or
even
to
hint
at
but
those
are
very
different
people
from
the
carnabys
then
i
suppose
she
added
with
abrupt
turn
carnaby
is
very
often
away
from
home
trying
to
reply
alma
found
her
voice
obstructed
think
so
very
kind
of
redgrave
was
it
has
he
spoken
about
it
to
course
not
he
oh
do
go
yet
dear
why
we
have
had
no
tea
it
is
four
must
you
really
go
of
course
you
are
overwhelmed
with
engagements
but
do
do
take
care
of
your
health
and
remember
our
little
scheme
if
redgrave
could
look
in
say
the
day
after
tomorrow
you
shall
hear
from
me
in
time
i
feel
i
really
feel
that
it
would
be
wise
to
let
him
think
you
understand
me
with
scarce
a
word
of
alma
hastened
away
the
air
of
this
room
was
stifling
her
and
the
low
cooing
voice
had
grown
more
intolerable
than
a
clanging
uproar
from
porchester
terrace
she
walked
into
bayswater
road
her
eyes
on
the
pavement
it
was
a
sunny
afternoon
but
there
had
been
showers
and
now
again
large
spots
of
rain
began
to
fall
as
she
was
opening
her
umbrella
a
cabman
voice
appealed
to
her
and
fixed
her
purpose
she
bade
him
drive
her
to
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
sibyl
was
not
at
home
the
could
not
say
when
she
might
return
she
had
been
absent
since
yesterday
morning
unable
to
restrain
herself
alma
inquired
whether
carnaby
was
in
town
he
was
not
he
had
been
away
for
several
days
on
the
morrow
a
letter
from
sibyl
came
to
pinner
she
was
grieved
to
hear
that
alma
had
called
during
her
absence
was
it
anything
of
importance
or
would
it
keep
till
she
and
harvey
came
to
dine
on
saturday
have
been
down
to
weymouth
not
to
enjoy
myself
but
to
see
my
mother
she
she
is
very
ill
and
thinks
it
monstrous
that
i
do
feel
inclined
to
devote
myself
to
the
care
of
her
her
illness
i
am
sure
is
nothing
but
discontent
and
bad
temper
just
because
she
feels
herself
dropping
out
of
society
she
must
get
used
to
it
in
any
case
we
could
never
endure
each
other
and
how
can
i
be
expected
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
a
mother
who
never
gave
me
an
hour
of
motherly
care
from
the
day
of
my
birth
but
you
know
all
about
this
and
want
to
hear
of
it
again
just
when
you
are
so
busy
if
there
is
anything
in
the
world
i
can
do
for
you
let
me
know
at
once
but
for
her
conversation
with
strangeways
it
would
not
have
occurred
to
alma
to
doubt
the
truth
of
what
sibyl
wrote
as
it
was
she
tortured
herself
with
dark
surmises
jealousy
without
love
a
passion
scarcely
intelligible
to
the
ordinary
man
is
in
woman
common
enough
and
more
often
productive
of
disaster
than
the
jealousy
which
originates
in
nobler
feeling
to
suspect
that
she
was
the
plaything
of
sibyl
subtlety
and
that
redgrave
smiled
at
her
simplicity
in
never
having
discovered
an
obvious
rival
fired
her
blood
to
the
fever
point
she
could
no
longer
balance
probabilities
all
the
considerations
which
hitherto
declared
for
sibyl
innocence
lost
their
weight
her
overexcited
mind
her
impaired
health
were
readily
receptive
of
such
poison
as
distilled
from
the
lips
of
strangeways
what
she
now
desired
was
proof
only
let
evidence
be
afforded
her
cost
what
it
might
after
that
she
saw
her
way
no
hugh
carnaby
was
assuredly
not
one
of
the
men
who
wink
at
their
wives
dishonour
nor
one
of
the
men
who
go
slinking
for
a
remedy
to
courts
of
law
or
she
mistook
him
strangely
at
receipt
of
the
expected
note
from
porchester
terrace
it
said
merely
be
here
if
possible
at
three
tomorrow
afternoon
she
quivered
with
anticipation
of
seeing
redgrave
how
it
was
to
come
about
she
did
not
ask
but
redgrave
should
not
part
from
her
before
she
had
obtained
light
upon
his
relations
with
sibyl
she
believed
herself
irresistible
if
she
chose
to
put
forth
all
her
power
with
two
men
dangerous
both
of
them
she
had
played
the
game
of
her
own
interests
played
it
safely
and
for
a
long
time
she
made
them
her
instruments
mocking
at
their
hopes
holding
them
at
in
spite
of
all
their
craft
and
their
vehemence
only
a
very
clever
woman
could
do
this
in
giddiness
of
she
felt
everything
to
be
possible
boldness
was
necessary
far
more
boldness
than
she
had
yet
dared
to
use
the
rivalry
of
such
a
woman
as
sibyl
could
not
be
despised
it
threatened
her
ambitions
but
in
the
struggle
now
to
be
decided
she
had
a
supreme
advantage
for
sibyl
having
gained
her
object
assuredly
had
paid
its
price
hence
her
pretended
absorption
in
study
hence
the
revival
of
her
friendliness
what
were
these
things
but
blinds
to
mislead
the
only
woman
whose
observation
she
had
much
reason
to
fear
how
astonishing
it
now
seemed
to
her
that
she
could
have
accepted
such
shallow
explanations
of
redgrave
partnership
with
hugh
carnaby
why
harvey
himself
least
suspicious
of
men
was
perplexed
and
avowed
his
inability
to
understand
it
as
for
strangeways
a
woman
of
the
world
if
there
was
one
the
fact
had
but
to
be
mentioned
to
her
and
on
the
moment
she
saw
its
meaning
no
wonder
the
matter
had
been
kept
so
quiet
but
for
the
honesty
of
the
duped
husband
no
one
at
all
would
have
heard
of
it
arriving
at
the
house
a
little
before
her
time
she
found
her
hostess
a
prey
to
vexation
dear
he
ca
come
it
most
annoying
only
an
hour
ago
i
had
a
telegram
look
the
despatch
was
from
coventry
expect
me
detained
on
business
redgrave
it
rustled
in
alma
hand
and
she
had
much
ado
to
keep
herself
from
tears
of
angry
chagrin
had
promised
to
be
here
went
on
strangeways
thought
nothing
would
have
kept
him
away
you
mean
asked
alma
bluntly
he
knew
i
was
coming
had
said
that
i
half
expected
you
do
be
vexed
dear
i
did
so
wish
you
to
meet
he
at
coventry
alma
continued
must
be
on
business
seems
likely
do
sit
down
you
still
look
anything
but
yourself
pray
pray
remember
that
you
have
only
a
day
or
two
worry
me
please
said
alma
with
a
contemptuous
gesture
she
had
thrown
off
reserve
caring
only
now
the
first
step
was
taken
to
make
all
possible
use
of
this
woman
whom
she
detested
her
voice
showed
the
change
that
had
been
wrought
in
her
she
addressed
her
hostess
almost
as
though
speaking
to
an
inferior
do
you
think
it
means
his
keeping
away
possibly
more
likely
the
other
thing
i
spoke
of
in
this
reply
strangeways
modified
her
tone
discarding
mellifluous
tenderness
yet
not
going
quite
so
far
as
alma
in
neglect
of
appearances
she
was
an
older
woman
and
had
learnt
the
injudiciousness
of
impulsive
behaviour
plainly
it
saves
time
you
think
he
wo
care
to
meet
me
at
all
again
do
say
that
i
should
be
very
sorry
indeed
to
think
it
but
to
speak
as
plainly
as
you
wish
dear
i
know
that
someone
must
have
said
unpleasant
things
to
him
about
your
your
friendship
with
mr
dymes
you
hinting
at
anyone
in
particular
alma
asked
salving
her
with
a
poor
affectation
of
haughtiness
yourself
my
dear
who
is
at
all
likely
to
give
him
such
information
alma
eyes
flashed
a
strange
word
to
use
do
you
imagine
there
is
any
information
of
that
kind
to
be
given
spoke
carelessly
answered
the
other
smiling
sit
down
dear
rolfe
i
sure
you
will
overtax
your
strength
before
tuesday
i
meant
nothing
whatever
i
assure
you
reluctantly
alma
became
seated
and
the
conversation
was
prolonged
without
disguise
they
debated
the
probability
that
redgrave
was
being
estranged
from
alma
by
sibyl
carnaby
of
course
taking
for
granted
sibyl
guilt
and
presuming
that
she
feared
rivalry
from
time
to
time
alma
threw
out
scornful
assertion
of
her
own
security
she
was
bold
to
the
point
of
cynicism
and
recklessly
revealed
herself
the
other
listened
attentively
still
smiling
but
without
constraint
upon
her
features
at
moments
she
appeared
to
feel
something
of
admiration
are
several
things
in
your
favour
she
remarked
deliberately
when
alma
had
declared
a
resolve
to
triumph
at
all
hazards
all
but
one
need
not
mention
it
i
do
understand
i
sure
you
do
you
alluded
to
it
the
other
day
some
women
have
such
tiresome
husbands
the
look
which
accompanied
this
struck
alma
cold
she
sat
motionless
staring
at
the
speaker
do
you
mean
you
think
that
my
husband
meant
only
to
encourage
you
my
dear
think
that
my
husband
has
less
sense
of
honour
than
mr
carnaby
strangeways
looked
wonderingly
at
her
strange
you
are
could
i
have
dreamt
of
saying
anything
so
implied
it
exclaimed
alma
her
voice
thrilling
on
the
note
of
indignation
dare
you
so
insult
me
is
it
possible
that
you
have
such
thoughts
overcome
by
what
seemed
to
her
the
humour
of
the
situation
mrs
strangeways
frankly
laughed
beg
your
pardon
a
thousand
times
my
dear
rolfe
i
have
misunderstood
i
am
afraid
you
quite
serious
yes
yes
there
has
been
a
misunderstanding
pray
forgive
me
alma
rose
from
her
chair
been
a
misunderstanding
if
you
knew
my
husband
if
you
had
once
met
him
such
a
thought
could
never
have
entered
your
mind
you
compare
him
to
his
disadvantage
with
mr
carnaby
what
right
have
you
to
do
that
i
believe
in
honesty
and
do
you
know
why
because
he
is
my
husband
friend
but
for
i
should
suspect
him
dear
replied
strangeways
are
wonderful
i
prophesy
great
things
for
you
i
never
in
my
life
met
so
interesting
a
woman
may
be
as
sarcastic
as
you
please
alma
retorted
in
a
low
passionate
voice
suppose
you
believe
in
no
one
have
said
dear
that
i
believe
in
and
i
shall
think
it
the
greatest
misfortune
if
i
lose
your
friendship
for
a
mere
indiscretion
indeed
i
was
only
trying
to
understand
you
completely
do
now
they
did
not
part
in
hostility
strangeways
had
the
best
of
reasons
for
averting
this
issue
at
any
cost
to
her
own
feelings
which
for
the
moment
had
all
but
escaped
control
though
the
complications
of
alma
character
puzzled
her
exceedingly
she
knew
how
to
smooth
over
the
trouble
which
had
so
unexpectedly
arisen
flattery
was
the
secret
of
her
influence
with
rolfe
and
it
still
availed
her
with
ostentation
of
frankness
she
pointed
a
contrast
between
alma
and
her
presumed
rival
carnaby
was
the
corrupt
unscrupulous
woman
who
shrank
from
nothing
to
gratify
a
base
selfishness
alma
was
the
artist
pursuing
a
legitimate
ambition
using
as
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
do
all
her
natural
resources
but
pure
in
soul
i
understand
you
at
last
and
i
admire
you
more
than
ever
you
will
go
far
my
dear
you
have
great
gifts
and
more
than
that
you
have
principle
it
is
character
that
tells
in
the
long
run
and
depend
upon
me
i
shall
soon
have
news
for
you
keep
quiet
prepare
yourself
for
next
tuesday
as
for
all
leave
it
to
me
scarcely
had
alma
left
the
house
when
she
suddenly
stood
still
as
though
she
had
forgotten
something
indeed
she
had
in
the
flush
of
loyal
resentment
which
repelled
an
imputation
upon
her
honour
she
had
entirely
lost
sight
of
her
secret
grievance
against
harvey
suddenly
revived
the
memory
helped
her
to
beat
down
that
assaulting
shame
which
took
advantage
of
reaction
in
mind
and
blood
harvey
was
not
honest
with
her
go
as
far
as
she
might
short
of
the
unpardonable
there
still
remained
to
her
a
moral
superiority
over
the
man
she
defended
and
yet
she
was
glad
to
have
defended
him
it
gave
her
a
sense
of
magnanimity
more
than
that
the
glow
of
an
honest
thought
was
strangely
pleasant
she
had
sundry
people
to
see
and
pieces
of
business
to
transact
what
a
nuisance
that
she
lived
so
far
from
the
centre
of
things
it
was
this
perpetual
travelling
that
had
disordered
her
health
and
made
everything
twice
as
troublesome
as
it
need
be
today
again
she
had
a
headache
and
the
scene
with
strangeways
had
made
it
worse
in
regent
street
she
met
dymes
she
was
not
afraid
of
him
now
for
she
had
learnt
how
to
make
him
keep
his
distance
and
after
the
great
day
if
he
continued
to
trouble
her
he
might
be
speedily
sent
to
the
he
made
an
inspiriting
report
already
a
considerable
number
of
tickets
had
been
sold
enough
he
said
or
all
but
enough
to
clear
expenses
advertising
and
all
asked
alma
leave
that
to
me
advertising
is
a
work
of
art
if
you
like
just
to
come
round
to
my
rooms
i
time
today
see
you
at
the
hall
on
monday
a
batch
of
weekly
newspapers
which
arrived
next
morning
saturday
proved
to
her
that
dymes
was
sufficiently
active
there
were
more
paragraphs
there
were
two
reproductions
of
her
portrait
and
as
for
advertisements
she
tried
with
some
anxiety
to
conjecture
the
cost
of
these
liberal
slices
of
page
with
their
type
naturally
the
same
question
would
occur
to
her
husband
but
harvey
kept
his
word
whatever
he
thought
he
said
nothing
and
alma
found
it
easier
to
be
with
him
than
at
any
time
since
she
had
read
mary
abbott
letter
perhaps
yesterday
event
accounted
for
it
they
dined
at
the
carnabys
the
first
time
for
months
that
they
had
dined
from
home
together
harvey
would
have
shirked
the
occasion
had
it
been
possible
with
great
relief
he
found
that
the
guests
were
all
absolute
strangers
to
him
and
that
they
represented
society
in
its
better
sense
with
no
suggestion
of
the
no
mrs
strangeways
or
rayner
mann
alma
equally
conscious
of
the
fact
viewed
it
as
a
calculated
insult
sibyl
had
brought
her
here
to
humiliate
her
she
entered
the
doors
with
jealous
hatred
boiling
in
her
heart
and
fixed
her
eyes
on
sibyl
with
such
fire
of
malicious
scrutiny
that
the
answer
was
a
gaze
of
marked
astonishment
but
they
had
no
opportunity
for
private
talk
sibyl
as
hostess
bore
herself
with
that
perfect
manner
which
no
effort
and
no
favour
of
circumstance
would
ever
enable
rolfe
to
imitate
envying
every
speech
and
every
movement
knowing
that
her
own
absent
behaviour
and
forced
talk
must
produce
an
unpleasant
impression
upon
the
strangers
she
longed
to
expose
the
things
unspeakable
that
lay
beneath
this
surface
of
social
brilliancy
what
was
more
she
would
do
it
when
time
was
ripe
only
this
consciousness
of
power
to
crush
her
enemy
enabled
her
to
bear
up
through
the
evening
at
the
she
chanced
to
encounter
sibyl
look
she
smiled
there
was
disquiet
in
that
glance
furtive
inquiry
and
apprehension
no
music
alma
would
have
doubted
whether
any
of
these
people
were
aware
of
her
claim
to
distinction
had
not
a
lady
who
talked
with
her
after
dinner
hinted
rather
than
announced
an
intention
of
being
present
at
prince
hall
next
tuesday
none
of
the
fuss
and
adulation
to
which
she
was
grown
accustomed
no
underbred
compliments
no
ambiguous
glances
from
men
it
angered
her
to
observe
that
harvey
did
not
seem
at
all
wearied
that
he
conversed
more
naturally
than
usual
in
a
mixed
company
especially
with
the
hostess
one
whisper
and
how
would
harvey
look
upon
his
friend
wife
but
the
moment
had
not
come
she
left
as
early
as
possible
parting
from
sibyl
as
she
had
met
her
with
eyes
that
scarce
dissembled
their
malignity
when
hugh
and
his
wife
were
left
together
sibyl
abstained
from
remark
on
alma
it
was
carnaby
who
introduced
the
subject
you
think
rolfe
looked
seedy
and
excitement
was
the
quiet
answer
think
it
more
than
likely
she
will
break
down
a
confounded
pity
why
she
has
grown
old
all
at
once
losing
her
good
looks
did
you
notice
that
her
eyes
were
a
little
bloodshot
i
noticed
it
i
did
like
her
look
at
all
hugh
as
his
custom
was
paced
the
floor
nowadays
he
could
not
keep
still
and
he
had
contracted
an
odd
habit
of
swinging
his
right
arm
with
fist
clenched
as
though
relieving
his
muscles
after
some
unusual
constraint
jove
sibyl
when
i
compare
her
with
you
i
feel
sorry
for
rolfe
ca
help
it
why
did
you
stop
this
silly
business
before
it
went
so
far
a
characteristic
question
dear
boy
sibyl
replied
merrily
are
more
things
in
life
particularly
woman
life
than
your
philosophy
ever
dreamt
of
alma
has
quite
outgrown
me
and
i
begin
to
suspect
that
she
wo
honour
me
with
her
acquaintance
much
longer
one
thing
we
belong
to
different
worlds
do
you
see
and
the
difference
in
future
will
be
rather
considerable
i
sorry
rolfe
is
half
the
man
he
was
why
on
earth
stop
it
he
hates
it
anyone
can
see
why
if
i
were
in
his
place
sibyl
interrupted
with
her
mellow
laughter
would
be
a
bit
wiser
it
the
fate
of
men
except
those
who
have
the
courage
to
beat
their
wives
you
know
you
came
back
to
england
at
my
heels
when
you
did
want
to
now
a
little
energy
a
little
practice
with
the
horsewhip
carnaby
made
pretence
of
laughing
but
he
turned
away
his
face
the
jest
had
too
serious
an
application
yes
yes
if
he
had
disregarded
sibyl
wishes
and
stayed
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
it
seemed
to
him
strange
that
she
could
speak
of
the
subject
so
lightly
he
must
have
been
more
successful
than
he
thought
in
concealing
his
true
state
of
mind
tells
me
he
has
got
a
house
at
gunnersbury
he
mentioned
it
to
me
why
gunnersbury
there
must
be
some
reason
they
do
tell
us
his
wife
said
hugh
impatiently
doubt
the
choice
is
hers
doubt
but
i
do
think
added
sibyl
musingly
shall
ask
alma
that
or
anything
else
i
do
think
i
care
much
for
alma
in
her
new
development
for
a
time
i
shall
try
leaving
her
alone
i
sorry
for
poor
old
rolfe
repeated
hugh
chapter
on
monday
morning
hugh
carnaby
received
a
letter
from
ascott
larkfield
it
was
years
since
sibyl
mother
had
written
to
him
and
the
present
missive
scrawled
in
an
unsteady
hand
gave
him
some
concern
larkfield
wrote
that
she
was
very
ill
so
ill
that
she
had
abandoned
hope
of
recovery
she
asked
him
whether
as
her
he
thought
it
right
that
she
should
be
abandoned
to
the
care
of
strangers
it
was
the
natural
result
no
doubt
of
her
impoverished
condition
such
was
the
world
had
she
still
been
wealthy
her
latter
days
would
not
have
been
condemned
to
solitude
but
let
him
remember
that
she
still
had
in
her
disposal
an
income
of
about
six
hundred
pounds
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
would
have
passed
to
sibyl
by
a
will
on
the
point
of
being
executed
this
money
would
benefit
a
charitable
institution
to
him
this
might
be
a
matter
of
indifference
she
merely
mentioned
the
fact
to
save
sibyl
a
possible
disappointment
hugh
and
his
wife
when
both
had
read
the
letter
exchanged
uneasy
glances
is
the
money
said
carnaby
the
money
but
after
all
sibyl
she
your
mother
what
does
mean
sibyl
returned
coldly
i
feel
the
least
bit
of
sorrow
if
she
dies
am
i
to
play
the
hypocrite
just
because
this
woman
brought
me
into
the
world
we
have
always
hated
each
other
and
whose
fault
when
i
was
a
child
she
left
me
to
thieving
servants
they
were
my
teachers
and
wonderful
enough
that
that
nothing
worse
came
of
it
when
i
grew
up
she
left
me
to
do
as
i
pleased
anything
so
that
i
gave
her
no
trouble
do
you
wish
me
to
go
and
pretend
tell
you
what
i
run
down
to
weymouth
myself
shall
i
perhaps
i
might
arrange
something
for
her
comfort
i
mean
sibyl
carelessly
assented
having
business
in
town
hugh
could
not
start
till
afternoon
but
he
would
reach
weymouth
by
six
and
might
manage
to
be
back
again
in
time
for
rolfe
concert
tomorrow
should
put
myself
to
any
inconvenience
on
that
account
said
sibyl
smiling
of
regard
for
rolfe
that
all
he
left
home
at
eleven
transacted
his
business
and
at
one
turned
in
for
lunch
at
a
strand
restaurant
before
proceeding
to
waterloo
as
he
entered
he
saw
rolfe
alone
at
one
of
the
tables
she
was
drawing
on
her
gloves
about
to
leave
they
met
with
friendly
greeting
though
hugh
from
the
look
with
which
rolfe
recognised
him
had
a
conviction
that
his
growing
dislike
of
her
was
fully
reciprocated
in
the
brief
talk
before
alma
withdrew
he
told
her
that
he
was
going
down
into
the
country
coventry
she
asked
turning
her
eyes
upon
him
to
weymouth
larkfield
is
no
better
i
afraid
and
sibyl
wants
me
to
see
her
you
wo
be
back
tomorrow
oh
yes
i
shall
certainly
be
back
in
time
unless
anything
very
serious
prevents
me
there
a
good
train
from
weymouth
at
gets
in
about
two
i
shall
easily
get
to
hall
by
three
alma
again
regarded
him
and
seemed
on
the
point
of
saying
something
but
she
turned
her
head
rose
and
rather
hastily
took
leave
hugh
remarked
to
himself
that
she
looked
even
worse
by
daylight
than
in
the
evening
decidedly
she
was
making
herself
ill
perhaps
he
added
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
for
his
luncheon
he
had
small
appetite
the
journey
before
him
was
a
nuisance
and
the
meeting
at
the
end
of
it
more
disagreeable
than
anything
he
had
ever
undertaken
what
a
simple
matter
life
would
be
but
for
women
that
sibyl
should
detest
her
mother
was
perhaps
natural
enough
all
things
considered
but
he
heartily
wished
they
were
on
better
terms
he
felt
that
sibyl
must
have
suffered
in
character
to
some
extent
by
this
abnormal
antipathy
he
did
not
blame
her
her
this
morning
proved
that
she
had
ground
for
judging
her
mother
sternly
and
perhaps
as
she
declared
only
by
her
own
strength
and
goodness
had
she
been
saved
from
the
worst
results
of
parental
neglect
hugh
did
not
often
meditate
upon
such
things
but
just
now
he
felt
impatience
and
disgust
with
women
who
would
not
care
properly
for
their
children
poor
old
rolfe
wife
for
instance
what
business
had
she
to
be
running
at
large
about
london
giving
concerts
making
herself
ill
and
ugly
whilst
her
little
son
was
left
to
a
governess
and
servants
he
had
half
a
mind
to
write
a
letter
to
old
rolfe
but
no
that
kind
of
thing
was
too
dangerous
even
between
the
nearest
friends
men
must
not
quarrel
women
did
more
than
enough
of
that
sibyl
and
alma
had
as
good
as
fallen
out
the
less
they
saw
of
each
other
the
better
and
now
he
had
to
face
a
woman
perhaps
dying
who
would
doubtless
rail
by
the
hour
at
her
own
daughter
o
heaven
for
a
breath
of
air
on
sea
or
mountain
or
prairie
could
he
stand
this
life
much
longer
driving
to
waterloo
he
thought
of
larkfield
bequest
to
the
charitable
institution
six
hundred
pounds
might
be
a
paltry
income
but
one
could
make
use
of
it
a
year
ago
to
be
sure
he
would
have
felt
more
troubled
by
the
loss
at
present
he
had
reason
to
look
forward
hopefully
so
far
as
money
could
represent
hope
the
cycle
business
was
moving
as
likely
as
not
it
would
ultimately
enrich
him
there
was
news
too
from
that
fellow
dando
in
queensland
who
declared
that
his
smelting
process
gradually
improved
had
begun
to
yield
results
and
talked
of
starting
a
new
company
hugh
business
of
the
morning
had
been
in
this
connection
by
inquiry
in
the
city
he
had
learnt
that
dando
report
might
be
relied
upon
and
that
capital
which
had
seemingly
vanished
would
certainly
yield
a
small
dividend
this
year
he
was
thankful
that
he
could
face
larkfield
without
the
shame
of
interested
motives
let
her
do
what
she
liked
with
her
money
he
went
to
see
the
woman
merely
out
of
humane
feeling
sense
of
duty
and
assuredly
no
had
ever
imposed
upon
himself
a
more
distasteful
office
on
alighting
at
the
station
he
found
that
the
only
coin
other
than
gold
which
he
had
in
his
pocket
was
a
shilling
in
accordance
with
usage
he
would
have
given
the
cabman
an
extra
sixpence
had
he
possessed
it
when
the
man
saw
a
tender
of
his
legal
fare
he
also
in
accordance
with
usage
broadened
his
mouth
tossed
the
coin
on
his
palm
and
pointedly
refrained
from
thanks
at
another
time
hugh
might
have
disregarded
this
professional
suavity
but
a
little
thing
exasperated
his
present
mood
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
drew
the
attention
of
everyone
near
it
your
fare
or
not
learn
better
manners
vicious
brute
before
the
driver
could
recover
breath
to
shout
a
primitive
insult
hugh
walked
into
the
station
here
whilst
his
wrath
was
still
hot
a
man
tearing
at
full
speed
to
catch
a
train
on
another
platform
bumped
violently
against
him
he
clenched
his
fist
and
but
for
the
gasped
apology
might
have
lost
himself
in
blind
rage
as
it
was
he
inwardly
cursed
railway
stations
cursed
england
cursed
civilisation
his
muscles
were
quivering
sweat
had
started
to
his
forehead
a
specialist
in
nervous
pathology
would
have
judged
hugh
carnaby
a
dangerous
person
on
this
monday
afternoon
he
took
his
ticket
and
having
some
minutes
to
wait
moved
towards
the
bookstall
by
his
side
as
he
scanned
the
papers
stood
a
lady
who
had
just
made
a
purchase
the
salesman
seemed
to
have
handed
her
insufficient
change
for
she
said
to
him
in
a
clear
voice
was
that
i
gave
you
at
the
sound
of
these
words
hugh
turned
sharply
and
looked
at
the
speaker
she
was
a
woman
of
solidly
built
well
dressed
without
display
of
fashion
the
upper
part
of
her
face
was
hidden
by
a
grey
veil
through
which
her
eyes
shone
intent
on
recovering
her
money
she
did
not
notice
that
the
man
beside
her
was
looking
and
listening
with
the
utmost
keenness
nor
on
turning
away
at
length
was
she
aware
that
hugh
followed
he
pursued
her
at
a
yard
distance
down
the
platform
and
into
the
covered
passage
which
leads
to
another
part
of
the
station
here
perhaps
because
the
footstep
behind
her
sounded
distinctly
she
gave
a
backward
glance
and
her
veiled
eyes
met
carnaby
at
once
he
stepped
to
her
side
do
think
i
can
be
mistaken
were
his
low
words
whilst
he
gazed
into
her
face
with
stern
fixedness
remember
me
maskell
no
doubt
do
not
sir
you
certainly
mistaken
she
replied
in
a
voice
which
so
admirably
counterfeited
a
french
accent
that
hugh
could
not
but
smile
even
whilst
setting
his
teeth
in
anger
at
her
impudence
that
settles
it
as
you
have
two
tongues
you
naturally
have
two
names
probably
more
i
happened
to
be
standing
by
you
at
the
bookstall
a
moment
ago
it
a
great
bore
i
was
just
starting
on
a
journey
but
i
must
trouble
you
to
come
with
me
to
the
nearest
police
station
you
have
too
much
sense
to
make
any
fuss
about
it
the
woman
glanced
this
way
and
that
two
or
three
people
were
hurrying
through
the
passage
but
they
perceived
nothing
unusual
have
a
choice
said
carnaby
my
companionship
and
that
of
the
policeman
make
up
your
mind
do
think
you
will
go
so
far
as
that
carnaby
said
the
other
with
and
in
her
natural
voice
not
i
can
tell
you
something
that
will
interest
you
very
much
something
that
nobody
else
can
do
you
mean
he
asked
roughly
refers
to
your
wife
that
all
i
need
say
just
now
are
lying
you
please
let
us
go
she
moved
on
with
unhurried
step
and
turned
towards
the
nearest
pausing
within
sight
of
the
vehicles
she
looked
again
at
her
companion
you
rather
have
a
little
quiet
talk
with
me
in
a
or
drive
straight
to
hugh
brain
was
in
commotion
the
hint
of
secrets
concerning
his
wife
had
not
its
full
effect
in
the
moment
of
utterance
it
sounded
the
common
artifice
of
a
criminal
but
maskell
cool
audacity
gave
significance
to
her
words
the
two
minutes
walk
had
made
hugh
as
much
afraid
of
her
as
she
could
be
of
him
he
stared
at
her
beset
with
horrible
doubts
it
be
a
pity
to
miss
your
train
she
said
with
a
friendly
smile
can
give
you
my
address
doubt
you
can
look
here
it
was
a
whether
i
should
let
you
go
or
not
until
you
said
if
you
had
begged
off
ten
to
one
i
should
have
thought
i
might
as
well
save
myself
trouble
but
after
that
cursed
lie
the
second
time
you
used
the
word
carnaby
i
not
accustomed
to
it
and
i
should
have
thought
you
would
speak
in
that
way
to
a
lady
he
was
aghast
at
her
assurance
which
for
some
reason
made
him
only
the
more
inclined
to
listen
to
her
he
beckoned
a
cab
shall
we
drive
to
clapham
junction
they
entered
the
and
as
soon
as
it
began
to
move
out
of
the
station
maskell
leaned
back
her
claim
to
be
considered
a
lady
suffered
no
contradiction
from
her
look
her
movements
or
her
speech
throughout
the
strange
dialogue
she
had
behaved
with
remarkable
and
made
use
of
the
aptest
phrases
without
a
sign
of
effort
in
the
years
which
had
elapsed
since
she
filled
the
position
of
housekeeper
to
carnaby
she
seemed
to
have
gained
in
the
externals
of
refinement
though
even
at
that
time
her
manners
were
noticeably
good
your
veil
please
said
hugh
when
he
had
pulled
up
the
second
window
she
obliged
him
and
showed
a
face
of
hard
yet
regular
outline
which
would
have
been
almost
handsome
but
for
its
high
and
coarse
lips
you
have
been
going
about
all
this
time
openly
discretion
i
am
not
perfect
unfortunately
rather
than
lose
sixpence
at
the
bookstall
i
forgot
myself
that
a
woman
weakness
we
do
easily
get
over
it
put
it
into
your
head
to
speak
of
my
wife
had
to
gain
time
had
i
not
in
a
sudden
burst
of
wrath
hugh
banged
the
window
open
but
before
he
could
call
to
the
cabman
a
voice
sounded
in
his
ear
a
clear
quick
whisper
the
lips
that
spoke
all
but
touching
him
you
know
that
your
wife
is
redgrave
mistress
he
fell
back
there
was
no
blood
in
his
face
his
eyes
stared
hideously
that
again
and
i
crush
the
life
out
of
you
look
like
it
but
you
wo
my
information
is
too
valuable
the
vilest
lie
ever
spoken
by
whore
and
thief
are
not
polite
mr
carnaby
she
still
controlled
herself
but
in
fear
as
quick
glances
showed
and
her
fear
was
not
unreasonable
the
man
glared
murder
that
and
tell
me
what
you
have
to
say
maskell
raised
the
window
again
have
compelled
me
you
see
it
a
pity
i
do
want
to
make
trouble
do
you
know
of
redgrave
keep
house
for
him
at
wimbledon
i
have
done
so
for
about
a
year
does
he
know
who
you
are
perhaps
not
quite
he
engaged
me
on
the
continent
a
friend
of
his
and
of
mine
recommended
me
and
he
had
reason
to
think
i
should
be
trustworthy
do
misunderstand
me
i
am
housekeeper
de
it
a
position
of
confidence
redgrave
but
you
know
him
the
listener
face
was
tumid
and
discoloured
his
eyes
bloodshot
with
fearful
intensity
he
watched
every
movement
of
maskell
features
do
you
know
i
know
him
been
at
his
place
i
seen
you
though
you
did
see
me
and
before
i
saw
you
i
heard
your
voice
one
remembers
voices
you
know
on
what
else
have
you
seen
or
heard
carnaby
has
been
there
too
know
that
hugh
shouted
rather
than
spoke
was
there
with
mrs
fenimore
redgrave
sister
and
several
other
people
last
summer
i
caught
sight
of
her
as
she
was
sitting
in
the
veranda
and
it
amused
me
to
think
how
little
she
suspected
who
was
looking
at
her
but
she
has
been
there
since
maskell
consulted
her
memory
and
indicated
a
day
in
the
past
winter
she
could
not
at
this
moment
recall
the
exact
date
but
had
a
note
of
it
carnaby
came
at
a
late
hour
of
the
evening
and
left
very
early
the
next
day
are
you
going
to
make
this
lie
seem
probable
asked
hugh
a
change
of
voice
betraying
the
dread
with
which
he
awaited
her
answer
for
the
time
of
which
she
spoke
was
exactly
that
when
redgrave
had
offered
himself
as
a
partner
in
the
firm
of
mackintosh
you
want
me
to
believe
that
she
came
and
went
so
that
every
one
could
see
her
no
i
was
new
to
the
place
then
and
full
of
curiosity
i
have
my
own
ways
of
getting
to
know
what
i
wish
to
know
remember
once
more
that
it
very
easy
to
recognise
a
voice
i
told
you
that
i
was
in
a
position
of
confidence
whenever
redgrave
wishes
for
quietness
he
has
only
to
mention
it
our
servants
are
well
disciplined
i
of
course
am
never
seen
by
visitors
whoever
they
may
be
and
whenever
they
come
but
it
happens
occasionally
that
i
see
even
when
redgrave
does
think
it
still
he
is
sometime
very
careful
indeed
and
so
he
was
on
that
particular
evening
you
remember
that
his
rooms
have
french
windows
a
convenient
arrangement
the
front
door
may
be
locked
and
bolted
but
people
come
and
go
for
all
that
the
bungalow
is
it
muttered
carnaby
how
often
do
you
pretend
you
have
heard
voice
that
once
it
was
worse
than
if
she
had
answered
times
hugh
looked
long
at
her
and
she
bore
his
gaze
with
indifference
do
pretend
that
you
her
i
did
see
her
if
you
are
not
deliberately
lying
you
have
made
a
mistake
maskell
smiled
and
shook
her
head
did
you
hear
talk
nothing
very
particular
want
to
know
what
it
was
as
far
as
i
could
make
out
carnaby
was
going
to
get
a
bicycle
and
wanted
to
know
what
was
the
best
not
much
harm
in
that
she
added
with
a
silent
laugh
hugh
sat
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
bending
forward
he
said
nothing
for
a
minute
or
two
and
at
length
looked
to
the
window
were
going
back
to
wimbledon
i
have
only
been
in
town
for
an
hour
or
two
redgrave
there
he
away
well
i
am
going
with
you
you
will
find
out
for
me
on
what
date
that
happened
but
what
is
the
understanding
between
us
hugh
saw
too
well
that
any
threat
would
be
idle
whether
this
woman
had
told
the
truth
or
not
her
position
in
redgrave
house
and
the
fact
of
redgrave
connection
with
the
firm
of
mackintosh
of
which
she
evidently
was
not
aware
put
it
in
her
power
to
strike
a
fatal
blow
at
sibyl
he
still
assured
himself
that
she
was
lying
how
doubt
it
and
maintain
his
sanity
but
the
lie
had
a
terrible
support
in
circumstances
who
could
hear
this
story
without
admitting
the
plausibility
of
its
details
a
man
such
as
redgrave
wealthy
and
a
bachelor
a
woman
such
as
sibyl
beautiful
fond
of
luxurious
living
her
husband
in
an
embarrassed
position
how
was
it
that
he
a
man
of
the
world
had
never
seen
things
in
this
light
doubtless
his
anxiety
had
blinded
him
that
and
his
absolute
faith
in
sibyl
and
frank
friendliness
even
if
he
obtained
as
he
would
complete
evidence
of
sibyl
honesty
maskell
could
still
dare
him
to
take
a
step
against
her
how
many
people
were
at
her
mercy
he
might
be
sure
that
she
would
long
ago
have
stood
in
the
dock
but
for
her
ability
to
make
scandalous
and
ruinous
revelations
did
redgrave
know
that
he
had
a
criminal
in
his
employment
possibly
he
knew
it
well
enough
there
was
no
end
to
the
appalling
suggestiveness
of
this
discovery
hugh
remembered
what
he
had
said
in
talk
with
harvey
rolfe
about
the
rottenness
of
society
never
had
he
felt
himself
so
much
a
coward
as
in
face
of
this
woman
whose
shameless
smile
covered
secrets
and
infamies
innumerable
the
cabman
was
bidden
drive
on
to
wimbledon
and
with
long
pauses
the
dialogue
continued
for
an
hour
hugh
interrogated
and
his
companion
on
every
matter
of
which
she
could
be
induced
to
speak
yet
he
learned
very
little
in
detail
concerning
either
her
own
life
or
redgrave
maskell
was
not
to
be
driven
to
any
disclosure
beyond
what
was
essential
to
her
own
purpose
by
dint
of
skilful
effrontery
she
had
gained
the
upper
hand
and
no
longer
felt
the
least
fear
of
him
i
believed
you
said
carnaby
at
a
certain
point
of
their
conversation
should
have
you
arrested
straight
away
it
matter
to
me
how
the
thing
came
out
it
would
be
public
property
before
long
would
you
find
your
witnesses
she
asked
me
alone
and
i
can
be
of
use
to
you
as
no
one
else
can
behave
shabbily
and
you
only
make
yourself
look
foolish
bringing
a
charge
against
your
wife
that
you
never
be
able
to
prove
you
would
get
no
evidence
from
me
whether
you
want
it
kept
quiet
or
want
to
bring
it
into
court
you
depend
upon
my
goodwill
they
reached
the
end
of
the
road
in
which
was
the
approach
to
redgrave
house
had
better
wait
here
said
the
woman
shall
be
ten
minutes
or
a
quarter
of
an
hour
you
need
feel
uneasy
i
have
the
least
intention
of
running
away
our
interests
are
mutual
and
if
you
do
your
part
you
can
trust
me
to
do
mine
she
stopped
the
cab
alighted
told
the
driver
to
wait
and
walked
quickly
down
the
hugh
drawn
back
into
a
corner
sat
with
head
drooping
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
hardly
stirred
twenty
minutes
thirty
minutes
passed
but
maskell
did
not
show
herself
at
length
finding
it
impossible
to
sit
still
any
longer
he
sprang
out
and
paced
backwards
and
forwards
vastly
to
his
relief
the
woman
at
length
appeared
is
there
she
said
could
get
away
before
he
alone
do
do
anything
foolish
carnaby
had
looked
as
if
he
would
move
towards
the
house
slightest
imprudence
and
you
only
harm
yourself
me
that
date
she
named
it
ca
stay
longer
and
i
advise
you
to
get
away
if
you
want
to
write
to
me
you
can
do
so
without
fear
my
letters
are
quite
safe
address
to
lant
and
remember
with
a
last
significant
look
she
turned
and
left
him
hugh
mentally
repeating
the
date
he
had
learnt
walked
back
to
the
cab
and
told
the
man
to
drive
him
to
the
nearest
railway
station
whichever
it
was
when
he
reached
home
some
four
hours
had
elapsed
since
his
encounter
with
maskell
or
lant
at
waterloo
it
seemed
to
him
a
whole
day
he
had
forgotten
all
about
his
purposed
journey
to
weymouth
one
sole
desire
had
possession
of
him
to
stand
face
to
face
with
sibyl
and
to
her
innocence
rather
than
hear
it
as
soon
as
he
had
brought
his
tongue
to
repeat
that
foul
calumny
he
would
then
know
how
to
deal
with
the
creature
who
thought
to
escape
him
by
slandering
his
wife
he
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
and
entered
the
it
was
vacant
he
looked
into
other
rooms
no
one
was
there
he
rang
and
a
servant
came
carnaby
been
out
long
she
had
left
was
the
reply
at
two
whilst
she
sat
at
luncheon
a
telegram
arrived
for
her
and
soon
after
she
prepared
to
go
out
saying
that
she
would
not
return
tonight
not
return
tonight
hugh
scarcely
restrained
an
exclamation
and
had
much
ado
to
utter
his
next
words
she
mention
where
she
was
going
sir
i
took
the
down
to
the
cab
and
the
cabman
was
told
to
drive
to
the
well
that
will
do
you
dine
at
home
sir
no
sibyl
gone
away
for
the
night
where
could
she
have
gone
to
he
began
to
look
about
for
the
telegram
she
had
received
it
might
be
lying
somewhere
and
possibly
would
explain
her
departure
in
the
basket
he
found
the
torn
envelope
lying
at
the
top
but
the
despatch
itself
was
not
to
be
discovered
gone
for
the
night
and
just
when
he
was
supposed
to
have
left
town
the
cabman
told
to
drive
to
the
this
might
be
for
the
purpose
of
despatching
a
reply
yet
no
the
reply
would
have
been
written
at
once
and
sent
by
the
messenger
in
the
usual
way
unless
unless
sibyl
for
some
reason
preferred
to
send
the
message
more
privately
or
again
she
might
not
care
to
let
the
servant
know
whither
the
cab
was
really
to
convey
her
sheer
madness
all
this
had
not
sibyl
fifty
legitimate
ways
of
spending
a
night
from
home
yet
there
was
the
fact
that
she
had
never
before
done
so
unexpectedly
never
before
he
looked
at
his
watch
six
he
rang
the
bell
again
any
one
called
since
carnaby
left
home
sir
there
have
been
three
calls
rolfe
rolfe
sir
she
seemed
very
disappointed
i
told
her
carnaby
would
not
be
back
tonight
the
others
two
persons
of
no
account
hugh
dismissed
them
and
the
servant
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
felt
a
faintness
such
as
accompanies
extreme
hunger
but
had
no
inclination
for
food
the
whisky
bottle
was
a
natural
resource
a
tumbler
of
right
scotch
restored
his
circulation
and
in
a
few
minutes
gave
him
a
raging
appetite
he
could
not
eat
here
but
eat
he
must
and
that
quickly
seizing
his
hat
he
ran
down
the
stairs
hailed
a
hansom
and
drove
to
the
nearest
restaurant
he
could
think
of
after
eating
without
knowledge
of
the
viands
and
drinking
a
bottle
of
claret
in
like
unconsciousness
he
smoked
for
half
an
hour
his
eyes
vacantly
set
his
limbs
lax
and
heavy
as
though
in
the
torpor
of
difficult
digestion
when
the
cigar
was
finished
he
roused
himself
looked
at
the
time
and
asked
for
a
railway
guide
there
was
a
train
to
wimbledon
at
ten
minutes
past
eight
he
might
possibly
catch
it
starting
into
sudden
activity
he
hastily
left
the
restaurant
and
reached
waterloo
station
with
not
a
moment
to
spare
at
wimbledon
he
took
a
cab
and
was
driven
up
the
hill
under
a
clouded
sky
dusk
had
already
changed
to
darkness
the
evening
was
warm
and
still
impatient
with
what
he
thought
the
slow
progress
of
the
vehicle
hugh
sat
with
his
body
bent
forward
straining
as
did
the
horse
on
which
his
eyes
were
fixed
and
perspiring
in
the
imaginary
effort
the
address
he
had
given
was
fenimore
but
when
he
drew
near
he
signalled
to
the
driver
at
the
gate
do
drive
up
from
the
entrance
to
fenimore
round
to
the
which
was
the
direct
approach
to
redgrave
bungalow
would
be
a
walk
of
some
ten
minutes
hugh
had
his
reasons
for
not
taking
this
direction
having
dismissed
his
cab
he
entered
by
the
and
walked
up
the
drive
moving
quickly
and
with
a
lighter
step
than
was
natural
to
him
when
he
came
within
view
of
the
house
he
turned
aside
and
made
his
way
over
the
grass
in
the
deep
shadow
of
leafy
until
the
illumined
windows
were
again
hidden
from
him
he
had
seen
no
one
and
heard
no
sound
a
path
which
skirted
the
gardens
would
bring
him
in
a
few
minutes
to
redgrave
abode
this
he
found
and
followed
the
bungalow
was
built
in
a
corner
of
the
park
where
previously
had
stood
a
gardener
cottage
round
about
it
grew
a
few
old
trees
and
on
two
sides
spread
a
shrubbery
sheltering
the
lawn
and
here
it
was
very
dark
hugh
advanced
cautiously
stopping
now
and
then
to
listen
he
reached
a
point
where
the
front
of
the
house
became
visible
a
light
shone
at
the
door
but
there
was
no
movement
and
hugh
could
hear
only
his
own
hard
breathing
he
kept
behind
the
laurels
and
made
a
of
the
house
on
passing
to
the
farther
side
he
would
come
within
view
of
those
windows
which
opened
so
conveniently
as
maskell
had
said
the
windows
of
redgrave
study
or
whatever
he
called
it
to
this
end
it
was
necessary
to
quit
the
cover
of
the
shrubs
and
cross
a
lawn
as
he
stepped
on
to
the
mown
grass
his
ear
caught
a
sound
the
sound
of
talking
in
a
subdued
tone
it
came
he
thought
from
that
side
of
the
building
which
he
could
not
yet
see
a
few
quick
silent
steps
and
this
conjecture
became
a
certainty
someone
was
talking
within
a
few
yards
of
him
just
round
the
obstructing
corner
and
he
felt
sure
the
voice
was
redgrave
it
paused
another
voice
made
reply
but
in
so
low
a
murmur
that
its
accents
were
not
to
be
recognised
that
it
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
the
listener
had
no
doubt
spurred
by
a
choking
anguish
he
moved
forward
he
saw
two
figures
standing
in
a
dim
light
from
the
a
man
and
a
woman
the
man
bareheaded
his
companion
in
outdoor
clothing
at
the
same
moment
he
himself
was
perceived
he
heard
a
hurried
in
and
at
once
the
woman
disappeared
face
to
face
with
redgrave
he
looked
at
the
window
but
the
curtain
which
dulled
the
light
from
within
concealed
everything
was
that
carnaby
what
the
deuce
was
what
do
you
mean
carnaby
took
a
step
redgrave
laid
an
arresting
hand
upon
him
there
needed
but
this
touch
in
frenzied
wrath
yet
with
the
precision
of
trained
muscle
hugh
struck
out
and
redgrave
went
down
before
him
thudding
upon
the
door
of
the
veranda
like
one
who
falls
dead
chapter
he
forced
the
window
he
rushed
into
the
room
and
there
before
him
pallid
trembling
agonising
stood
alma
rolfe
she
panted
incoherent
phrases
she
was
here
to
speak
with
redgrave
on
business
about
her
concert
tomorrow
she
had
not
entered
the
house
until
this
moment
she
had
met
redgrave
in
the
garden
is
that
to
me
broke
in
hugh
staring
wildly
his
fist
still
clenched
am
not
your
husband
carnaby
you
believe
me
i
came
for
a
minute
or
two
to
speak
about
nothing
to
me
rolfe
he
again
interrupted
her
in
a
hoarse
faint
voice
have
i
done
he
looked
to
the
window
whence
came
no
sound
i
gone
mad
by
god
i
almost
fear
it
believe
me
mr
carnaby
she
moved
to
him
and
seized
his
hand
know
me
too
well
you
know
i
could
say
you
believe
me
say
one
kind
friendly
word
she
looked
distracted
clinging
to
his
hand
she
burst
into
tears
but
hugh
hardly
noticed
her
he
kept
turning
towards
the
window
with
eyes
of
unutterable
misery
here
i
come
back
he
stepped
out
from
the
window
and
saw
that
redgrave
lay
just
where
he
had
fallen
straight
still
his
face
turned
upwards
hugh
stooped
and
moved
him
into
the
light
the
face
was
deathly
placid
but
for
its
wide
eyes
which
seemed
to
look
at
his
enemy
no
blood
upon
the
lips
no
sign
of
violence
did
i
hit
him
he
fell
with
his
head
against
something
i
suppose
from
the
parted
lips
there
issued
no
perceptible
breath
a
fear
which
was
more
than
half
astonishment
took
hold
upon
carnaby
he
looked
up
for
the
light
was
all
at
once
obstructed
and
saw
alma
gazing
at
him
is
it
she
asked
in
a
terrified
whisper
is
he
lying
there
struck
him
he
is
unconscious
him
he
drew
her
into
the
room
again
rolfe
i
shall
most
likely
have
to
send
for
help
you
must
be
seen
here
it
nothing
to
me
why
you
came
yes
yes
i
believe
you
but
you
must
go
at
once
wo
speak
of
it
her
appeal
was
that
of
a
child
helpless
in
calamity
again
she
caught
his
hand
as
if
clinging
for
protection
hugh
replied
in
thick
hurried
tones
have
enough
trouble
of
my
own
this
is
no
place
for
you
for
your
own
sake
if
not
for
your
husband
keep
away
from
here
i
came
because
someone
was
telling
foul
lies
the
kind
of
lies
that
drive
a
man
mad
whatever
happens
whatever
you
hear
do
imagine
that
is
to
blame
you
understand
me
word
shall
ever
pass
my
lips
at
once
get
home
as
soon
as
you
can
alma
turned
to
go
outside
she
cast
one
glance
at
the
dark
silent
unmoving
form
then
bowed
her
head
and
hastened
away
into
the
darkness
again
hugh
knelt
by
redgrave
side
raised
his
head
listened
for
the
beating
of
his
heart
tried
to
feel
his
breath
he
then
dragged
him
into
the
room
and
placed
him
upon
a
divan
he
loosened
the
fastenings
about
his
neck
the
head
drooped
and
there
was
not
a
sign
of
life
next
he
looked
for
a
bell
the
electric
button
caught
his
eye
and
he
pressed
it
to
prevent
any
one
from
coming
in
he
took
his
stand
close
by
the
door
in
a
moment
there
was
a
knock
the
door
opened
and
he
showed
his
face
to
the
surprised
lant
in
the
house
sir
redgrave
wants
her
at
once
he
is
the
servant
vanished
keeping
his
place
at
the
door
and
looking
out
into
the
hall
hugh
for
full
two
minutes
heard
no
movement
then
he
was
startled
by
a
low
voice
immediately
behind
him
are
you
doing
here
the
housekeeper
who
had
entered
from
the
garden
and
approached
in
perfect
silence
stood
gazing
at
him
not
unconcerned
but
with
full
command
of
herself
he
replied
pointing
to
the
figure
on
the
divan
he
only
insensible
or
dead
she
stepped
across
the
room
and
made
a
brief
examination
by
the
methods
carnaby
himself
had
used
never
saw
any
one
look
more
like
dead
was
her
quiet
remark
have
you
been
up
to
a
little
quiet
murder
met
him
outside
we
quarrelled
and
i
knocked
him
down
why
are
you
here
at
all
asked
the
woman
with
fierce
eyes
though
her
voice
kept
its
ordinary
level
of
you
and
your
talk
curse
you
ca
you
do
something
get
some
brandy
and
send
someone
for
a
doctor
you
going
to
be
found
here
she
inquired
meaningly
hugh
drew
a
deep
breath
and
stared
at
the
silent
figure
for
an
instant
his
face
showed
irresolution
then
it
changed
and
he
said
harshly
i
am
do
as
i
told
you
get
the
spirits
and
send
someone
sharp
carnaby
you
a
great
blundering
thickhead
if
you
care
for
my
opinion
of
you
you
deserve
all
you
got
and
all
you
get
hugh
again
breathed
deeply
the
woman
abuse
was
nothing
to
him
you
going
to
do
anything
he
said
shall
i
ring
for
someone
else
she
left
the
room
and
speedily
returned
with
a
decanter
of
brandy
all
their
exertions
proved
useless
the
head
hung
aside
the
eyes
stared
in
a
few
minutes
carnaby
asked
whether
a
doctor
had
been
sent
for
when
i
hear
him
at
the
door
i
shall
go
away
you
came
here
against
my
advice
and
you
made
a
pretty
job
of
it
well
always
get
work
at
a
her
laugh
was
harder
to
bear
than
the
words
it
followed
hugh
with
a
terrible
look
waved
her
away
from
him
or
i
do
know
what
i
may
do
next
take
yourself
out
of
my
sight
out
she
gave
way
before
him
backing
to
the
door
there
she
laughed
again
waved
her
hand
in
a
contemptuous
farewell
and
withdrew
for
half
an
hour
carnaby
stood
by
the
divan
or
paced
the
room
once
or
twice
he
imagined
a
movement
of
redgrave
features
and
bent
to
regard
them
closely
but
in
truth
there
was
no
slightest
change
within
doors
and
without
prevailed
unbroken
silence
not
a
step
not
a
rustle
the
room
seemed
to
grow
intolerably
hot
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
forehead
hugh
went
to
the
window
and
opened
it
a
few
inches
a
scent
of
vegetation
and
of
fresh
earth
came
to
him
with
the
cool
air
he
noticed
that
rain
had
begun
to
fall
large
drops
pattering
softly
on
leaves
and
grass
and
the
roof
of
the
veranda
then
sounded
the
rolling
of
carriage
wheels
nearer
and
nearer
it
was
the
doctor
carriage
no
doubt
uncertainty
soon
came
to
an
end
cyrus
redgrave
was
beyond
help
he
must
have
breathed
his
last
so
said
the
doctor
at
the
moment
when
he
fell
not
as
a
result
of
the
fall
the
blow
of
carnaby
fist
had
killed
him
there
is
one
stroke
which
if
delivered
with
sufficient
accuracy
and
sufficient
force
will
slay
more
surely
than
any
other
it
is
the
stroke
which
catches
an
uplifted
chin
just
at
the
right
angle
to
drive
the
head
back
and
shatter
the
spinal
cord
this
had
plainly
happened
the
man
neck
was
broken
and
he
died
on
the
spot
carnaby
and
the
doctor
stood
regarding
each
other
they
spoke
in
subdued
voices
was
not
a
fight
you
say
blow
from
me
that
was
all
he
said
something
that
maddened
me
you
report
yourself
here
is
my
card
sad
business
carnaby
can
i
be
of
any
use
to
you
can
though
i
hesitate
to
ask
it
fenimore
should
be
told
at
once
i
ca
do
that
myself
know
fenimore
very
well
i
will
see
her
if
she
is
at
home
on
this
errand
the
doctor
set
forth
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
hugh
rang
the
bell
the
same
domestic
as
before
answered
it
and
again
he
asked
for
lant
he
waited
five
minutes
the
servant
came
back
saying
that
lant
was
not
in
the
house
this
did
not
greatly
surprise
him
but
he
insisted
on
a
repetition
of
the
search
lant
could
not
be
found
evidently
her
disappearance
was
a
mystery
to
this
young
woman
who
seemed
ingenuous
to
the
point
of
are
not
to
go
into
that
room
said
hugh
they
were
talking
in
the
hall
doctor
will
return
presently
and
therewith
he
left
the
house
but
not
the
grounds
for
in
rain
and
darkness
he
stood
watching
from
a
place
of
concealment
watching
at
the
same
time
redgrave
curtained
window
and
the
front
entrance
his
patience
was
not
overtaxed
there
sounded
an
approaching
vehicle
it
came
up
the
drive
and
stopped
at
the
front
door
where
at
once
alighted
the
doctor
and
a
lady
hugh
espial
was
at
an
end
as
the
two
stepped
into
the
house
he
walked
quickly
away
yes
he
would
himself
but
not
until
he
had
seen
sibyl
to
that
end
he
must
go
home
and
wait
there
the
people
at
wimbledon
who
doubtless
would
communicate
with
the
police
might
cause
him
to
be
arrested
before
his
wife
return
he
feared
this
much
more
than
what
was
to
follow
worse
than
anything
that
could
befall
him
would
be
to
lose
the
opportunity
of
speaking
in
private
with
sibyl
before
she
knew
what
had
happened
in
the
early
hours
of
the
morning
he
lay
down
upon
his
bed
and
had
snatches
of
troubled
sleep
knowing
that
he
was
wrong
in
the
particular
surmise
which
led
him
to
redgrave
house
sibyl
absence
no
longer
disturbed
him
with
suspicions
a
few
hours
would
banish
from
his
mind
the
last
doubt
of
her
if
any
really
remained
he
had
played
the
madman
bringing
ruin
upon
himself
and
misery
incalculable
upon
his
wife
just
because
that
thieving
woman
lied
to
him
she
of
course
had
made
her
speedy
escape
and
was
it
not
as
well
for
if
the
whole
story
became
known
what
hope
was
there
that
sibyl
would
come
out
of
it
with
untarnished
fame
merely
for
malice
sake
the
woman
would
repeat
and
magnify
her
calumnies
if
she
successfully
concealed
herself
it
might
be
possible
to
avoid
a
mention
of
sibyl
name
he
imagined
various
devices
for
this
purpose
his
brain
plotting
even
when
he
slept
to
alma
rolfe
he
gave
scarcely
a
thought
if
the
worst
were
true
of
her
rolfe
had
only
to
thank
his
own
absurdity
which
allowed
such
a
conceited
simpleton
to
do
as
she
chose
the
case
looked
black
against
her
well
she
had
had
her
lesson
and
in
quarter
could
come
to
no
more
harm
what
sort
of
an
appearance
was
she
likely
to
make
at
prince
hall
today
fool
before
five
the
sunlight
streamed
into
his
bedroom
sparrows
twittered
about
the
window
and
somewhere
close
by
perhaps
in
a
neighbour
flat
a
caged
throstle
piped
as
though
it
were
in
the
fields
then
began
the
street
noises
and
hugh
could
lie
still
no
longer
remembering
that
at
any
moment
his
freedom
might
come
to
an
end
he
applied
himself
to
arranging
certain
important
matters
the
housemaid
came
upon
him
with
surprise
he
bade
her
get
breakfast
and
when
the
meal
was
ready
partook
of
it
with
moderate
appetite
the
postman
brought
letters
nothing
of
interest
for
him
and
for
sibyl
only
an
envelope
which
as
one
could
feel
contained
a
mere
card
of
invitation
but
soon
after
nine
there
arrived
a
telegram
it
was
from
sibyl
herself
and
from
weymouth
are
you
not
here
she
died
yesterday
if
this
reaches
you
reply
at
once
he
flung
the
scrap
of
paper
aside
and
laughed
of
all
natural
explanations
this
of
course
had
never
occurred
to
him
telegram
told
of
larkfield
serious
condition
and
sibyl
had
started
at
once
for
weymouth
expecting
to
meet
him
there
one
word
of
hers
to
the
servant
and
he
would
simply
have
followed
her
but
sibyl
saw
no
necessity
for
that
word
she
was
always
reserved
with
domestics
by
the
messenger
he
despatched
a
reply
he
would
be
at
weymouth
as
soon
as
possible
he
incurred
the
risk
of
appearing
to
run
away
but
that
mattered
little
sibyl
could
hardly
return
before
her
mother
burial
and
by
going
yonder
to
see
her
he
escaped
the
worse
danger
probably
the
certainty
of
arrest
before
any
possible
meeting
with
her
in
london
dreading
this
more
than
ever
he
made
ready
in
a
few
minutes
the
telegraph
boy
had
hardly
left
the
building
before
hugh
followed
a
glance
at
the
timetables
had
shown
him
that
if
he
travelled
by
the
he
could
reach
weymouth
at
five
minutes
past
four
whereas
the
first
train
he
could
catch
at
waterloo
would
not
bring
him
to
his
destination
until
half
an
hour
later
on
the
other
hand
he
could
get
away
from
london
by
the
forty
minutes
sooner
than
by
the
other
line
and
this
decided
him
yesterday
waterloo
had
been
merely
the
more
convenient
station
on
account
of
his
business
in
town
today
he
chose
it
because
he
had
to
evade
arrest
on
a
charge
of
homicide
so
comforted
was
he
by
the
news
from
sibyl
that
he
could
reflect
on
this
joke
of
destiny
and
grimly
smile
at
it
at
the
end
of
his
journey
he
betook
himself
to
an
hotel
and
immediately
sent
a
message
to
sibyl
before
her
arrival
he
had
swallowed
meat
and
drink
he
waited
for
her
in
a
private
room
which
looked
seaward
the
sight
of
the
blue
channel
the
smell
of
salt
breezes
made
his
heart
ache
he
was
standing
at
the
window
watching
a
steamer
that
had
just
left
port
when
sibyl
entered
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
are
these
mysterious
movements
she
asked
coming
forward
with
a
smile
did
you
alter
your
mind
yesterday
was
well
he
could
say
nothing
more
yet
sibyl
face
was
so
tranquil
and
she
seemed
so
glad
to
rejoin
him
that
his
tongue
refused
to
utter
any
alarming
word
and
the
more
he
searched
her
countenance
the
more
detestable
did
it
seem
that
he
should
insult
her
by
the
semblance
of
a
doubt
well
indeed
you
look
dreadfully
out
of
sorts
how
long
had
i
been
gone
when
you
got
home
again
hour
or
two
but
tell
me
first
about
your
mother
she
died
before
you
came
soon
after
they
sent
the
telegram
gravely
but
with
no
affectation
of
distress
she
related
the
circumstances
making
known
finally
that
larkfield
had
died
intestate
are
quite
sure
of
that
asked
hugh
with
an
eagerness
which
surprised
her
almost
with
her
last
breath
she
talked
about
it
and
said
that
she
make
her
will
and
she
had
spoken
of
it
several
times
lately
the
people
there
knew
all
about
her
affairs
she
kept
putting
it
off
and
as
likely
as
not
she
wished
the
money
to
be
mine
after
all
i
am
sure
she
must
have
felt
that
she
owed
me
something
carnaby
experienced
a
profound
relief
sibyl
was
now
provided
for
whatever
turn
his
affairs
might
take
she
had
seated
herself
by
the
window
and
with
her
gloved
hands
crossed
upon
her
lap
was
gazing
absently
towards
the
sea
how
great
must
be
relief
thought
hugh
and
still
he
looked
at
her
smooth
pure
features
at
her
placid
eyes
in
which
after
all
he
seemed
to
detect
a
little
natural
sadness
and
the
accusation
in
his
mind
assumed
so
grotesque
an
incredibility
that
he
asked
himself
how
he
should
dare
to
hint
at
it
there
something
you
have
told
me
she
said
regarding
him
with
anxiety
when
he
had
just
uttered
her
name
and
then
averted
his
look
never
saw
you
look
so
dear
there
is
something
it
was
not
often
he
spoke
so
gently
sibyl
waited
one
of
her
hands
clasping
the
other
and
her
lips
close
set
was
at
wimbledon
last
night
at
redgrave
he
paused
again
for
the
last
word
choked
him
unless
it
were
a
tremor
of
the
eyelids
no
movement
betrayed
itself
in
sibyl
features
yet
their
expression
had
grown
cold
and
seemed
upon
the
verge
of
a
disdainful
wonder
the
pupils
of
her
eyes
insensibly
dilated
as
though
to
challenge
scrutiny
and
defy
it
of
that
she
said
when
his
silence
urged
her
to
speak
happened
between
us
we
quarrelled
her
lips
suddenly
parted
and
he
heard
her
quick
breath
but
the
look
that
followed
was
of
mere
astonishment
and
in
a
moment
before
she
spoke
it
softened
in
a
smile
is
your
dreadful
news
you
quarrelled
and
he
is
going
to
withdraw
from
the
business
oh
my
dear
boy
how
ridiculous
you
are
i
thought
all
sorts
of
horrible
things
were
you
afraid
i
should
make
an
outcry
and
you
have
worried
yourself
into
illness
about
oh
foolish
fellow
before
she
ceased
her
voice
was
broken
with
laughter
a
laugh
of
extravagant
gaiety
of
mocking
mirth
that
brought
the
blood
to
her
face
and
shook
her
from
head
to
foot
only
when
she
saw
that
her
husband
gloom
underwent
no
change
did
this
merriment
cease
then
with
abrupt
gravity
which
was
almost
annoyance
her
eyes
shining
with
moisture
and
her
cheeks
flushed
she
asked
him
that
it
than
that
hugh
answered
but
he
spoke
more
freely
for
he
no
longer
felt
obliged
to
watch
her
countenance
his
duty
now
was
to
soften
the
outrage
involved
in
repeating
maskell
fiction
by
making
plain
his
absolute
faith
in
her
and
to
contrive
his
story
so
as
to
omit
all
mention
of
a
third
person
presence
at
the
fatal
interview
do
tell
me
and
have
done
exclaimed
sibyl
almost
petulantly
quarrelled
and
i
struck
him
and
the
blow
was
fatal
you
mean
he
was
killed
the
blood
vanished
from
her
face
leaving
pale
horror
terrible
accident
a
blow
that
happened
to
i
could
believe
it
till
the
doctor
came
and
said
he
was
dead
tell
me
more
what
led
to
it
how
could
you
strike
mr
redgrave
sibyl
had
all
at
once
subdued
her
voice
to
an
excessive
calmness
her
hands
were
trembling
she
folded
them
again
upon
her
lap
every
line
of
her
face
every
muscle
of
her
body
declared
the
constraint
in
which
she
held
herself
this
said
hugh
inwardly
was
no
more
than
he
had
expected
disaster
made
noble
proof
of
sibyl
strength
tell
you
from
the
beginning
he
recounted
faithfully
the
incidents
at
waterloo
station
and
the
beginning
of
maskell
narrative
in
the
cab
at
the
disclosure
of
her
relations
with
redgrave
he
was
interrupted
by
a
short
hard
laugh
could
help
it
hugh
that
woman
why
you
have
always
said
you
were
sure
to
meet
her
somewhere
housekeeper
at
redgrave
we
know
what
the
end
of
that
would
be
sibyl
talked
rapidly
in
an
excited
chatter
the
kind
of
utterance
never
heard
upon
her
lips
was
strange
hugh
continued
to
have
been
mere
chance
then
she
began
to
say
that
she
had
learnt
some
of
redgrave
secrets
about
people
who
came
and
went
mysteriously
and
then
sibyl
i
ca
speak
the
words
it
was
the
foulest
slander
that
she
could
have
invented
she
meant
to
drive
me
mad
and
she
succeeded
curse
her
drops
of
anguish
stood
upon
his
forehead
he
sprang
up
and
crossed
the
room
turning
again
he
saw
his
wife
gazing
at
him
as
if
in
utmost
perplexity
i
do
in
the
least
understand
you
what
the
slander
perhaps
i
am
stupid
but
he
came
near
but
could
not
look
her
in
the
eyes
dearest
his
voice
shook
was
an
infamous
lie
about
that
had
been
there
of
course
i
have
you
know
that
i
have
meant
more
than
that
she
said
you
had
been
there
secretly
at
night
hugh
carnaby
the
man
who
had
lived
as
men
do
live
who
had
laughed
by
the
or
in
the
club
at
many
a
rabelaisian
story
and
capped
it
with
another
who
hated
mock
modesty
was
all
for
honest
openness
between
man
and
woman
stood
in
guilty
embarrassment
before
his
own
wife
face
of
innocence
it
would
have
been
a
sheer
impossibility
for
him
to
ask
her
where
and
how
she
spent
a
certain
evening
last
winter
sibyl
now
as
ever
was
his
ideal
of
chaste
womanhood
he
scorned
himself
for
what
he
had
yet
to
tell
sibyl
was
gazing
at
him
steadily
inquiringly
made
you
believe
this
fell
upon
the
silence
in
her
softest
clearest
tones
she
could
make
me
it
but
the
artful
devil
had
such
a
way
of
talking
understand
you
did
know
whether
to
believe
or
not
just
tell
me
please
what
proof
she
offered
you
hugh
hung
his
head
had
heard
you
talking
in
the
house
on
a
certain
he
looked
up
timidly
and
met
a
flash
of
derisive
scorn
heard
me
talking
hugh
i
really
do
see
much
art
in
this
you
seem
to
have
been
wrought
upon
rather
easily
it
never
occurred
to
you
i
suppose
to
ask
for
a
precise
date
he
mentioned
the
day
and
sibyl
turning
her
head
a
little
appeared
to
reflect
unfortunate
i
remember
nothing
whatever
of
that
date
afraid
hugh
that
i
could
possibly
prove
an
alibi
her
smiling
sarcasm
made
the
man
wince
his
broad
shoulders
shrank
together
he
stood
in
an
awkward
swaying
posture
i
told
her
she
lied
was
very
courageous
but
what
came
next
you
had
the
happy
idea
of
going
to
wimbledon
to
make
personal
inquiries
to
put
yourself
in
my
place
sibyl
he
pleaded
all
the
circumstances
ca
you
see
the
danger
of
such
a
lie
as
that
i
went
home
hoping
to
find
you
there
but
you
had
gone
and
nobody
knew
where
you
would
be
back
that
night
a
telegram
had
called
you
away
i
was
told
when
i
asked
where
you
told
the
cabman
to
drive
you
to
the
it
looked
very
black
yes
yes
i
quite
understand
the
facts
are
so
commonplace
that
i
really
ashamed
to
mention
them
at
came
an
urgent
telegram
from
weymouth
i
sent
no
reply
then
because
i
thought
i
knew
that
you
were
on
your
way
but
when
i
was
ready
to
start
it
occurred
to
me
that
i
should
save
you
trouble
by
wiring
that
i
should
join
you
as
soon
as
possible
so
i
drove
to
the
before
going
to
well
you
rushed
off
to
wimbledon
till
later
and
because
i
was
suffering
damnably
if
i
had
been
what
would
it
have
meant
when
a
man
thinks
as
much
of
his
wife
as
i
do
of
you
has
a
right
to
imagine
anything
of
her
she
interrupted
in
a
changed
tone
gently
reproachful
softening
to
tenderness
a
singularity
of
sibyl
demeanour
was
that
she
seemed
utterly
forgetful
of
the
dire
position
in
which
her
husband
stood
one
would
have
thought
that
she
had
no
concern
beyond
the
refutation
of
an
idle
charge
which
angered
her
indeed
but
afforded
scope
for
irony
possibly
for
play
of
wit
for
the
moment
hugh
himself
had
almost
forgotten
the
worst
but
he
was
bidden
to
proceed
and
again
his
heart
sank
went
there
in
the
evening
redgrave
happened
to
be
outside
in
that
veranda
of
his
i
saw
him
as
i
came
near
in
the
dark
and
i
fancied
that
that
he
had
been
talking
to
someone
in
the
room
through
the
folding
windows
i
went
up
to
him
quickly
and
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
he
pulled
the
window
to
after
that
i
only
remember
that
i
was
raving
mad
he
seemed
to
want
to
stop
me
and
i
struck
at
him
and
that
was
the
end
sibyl
shuddered
went
into
the
room
no
one
was
there
both
kept
silence
sibyl
had
become
very
grave
and
was
thinking
intently
then
with
a
few
brief
questions
vigilant
precise
she
learnt
all
that
had
taken
place
between
hugh
and
maskell
between
hugh
and
the
doctor
heard
of
the
woman
disappearance
and
of
mrs
fenimore
arrival
on
the
scene
shall
you
do
now
back
and
give
myself
up
what
else
i
do
tell
everything
as
you
have
told
it
to
me
hugh
met
her
eyes
and
moved
his
arms
in
a
gesture
of
misery
i
will
think
of
something
he
is
dead
and
ca
contradict
and
the
woman
will
hide
trust
her
your
name
sha
come
into
it
at
all
i
owe
you
that
sibyl
i
find
some
cause
for
a
quarrel
with
him
your
name
sha
be
spoken
she
listened
her
eyes
down
her
forehead
lined
in
thought
know
what
hugh
exclaimed
with
gloomy
resolve
woman
of
course
there
be
a
mystery
and
she
be
searched
for
why
he
blustered
against
his
shame
should
she
be
the
cause
of
it
yes
that
would
do
his
hoarse
laugh
caused
a
tremor
in
sibyl
she
rose
and
stepped
close
to
him
and
laid
a
hand
upon
his
shoulder
far
you
have
advised
yourself
will
you
let
me
advise
you
now
dear
that
seem
likely
think
not
and
if
it
what
is
the
result
you
will
be
dealt
with
much
more
severely
do
you
see
that
that
to
me
what
do
i
care
so
long
as
you
are
out
of
the
vile
business
you
will
have
no
difficulties
your
mother
money
and
then
mackintosh
is
that
all
asked
sibyl
with
a
look
which
seemed
to
wonder
profoundly
i
to
think
only
of
my
own
safety
all
my
cursed
fault
just
because
i
a
fierce
strong
brute
who
ought
to
be
anywhere
but
among
civilised
people
i
killed
the
man
who
meant
me
nothing
but
kindness
am
i
going
to
drag
name
into
the
mud
to
set
people
grinning
and
winking
quiet
hugh
and
listen
i
have
a
much
clearer
head
than
yours
poor
boy
there
only
one
way
of
facing
this
scandal
and
that
is
to
tell
everything
for
one
thing
i
shall
not
let
you
shield
that
woman
we
shall
catch
her
yet
i
shall
not
let
you
disgrace
yourself
by
inventing
squalid
stories
do
you
see
too
that
the
disgrace
would
be
shared
by
by
the
dead
man
would
that
be
right
and
another
thing
if
shame
comes
upon
you
do
you
think
i
have
no
part
in
it
we
have
to
face
it
out
with
the
truth
do
know
what
that
means
he
answered
with
a
groan
know
the
world
sibyl
did
not
smile
but
her
lips
seemed
only
to
check
themselves
when

and
crushed

in
his
arms
darling
worse
than
killing
a
man
who
never
harmed
me
was
to
think
wrong
of
you
her
face
had
grown
very
pale
she
closed
her
eyes
smiled
faintly
as
she
leaned
her
head
against
him
and
of
a
sudden
burst
into
tears
chapter
shows
one
ignorance
of
such
matters
said
harvey
rolfe
with
something
of
causticity
in
his
humour
when
alma
came
home
after
midnight
should
have
thought
that
by
way
of
preparing
for
tomorrow
you
would
have
quietly
rested
today
he
looked
round
at
her
alma
had
entered
the
study
as
usual
and
was
taking
off
her
gloves
but
the
effort
of
supporting
herself
seemed
too
great
she
trembled
towards
the
nearest
chair
and
affected
to
laugh
at
her
feebleness
as
she
sank
down
will
come
she
said
in
such
a
voice
as
sounds
from
a
parched
and
quivering
throat
take
good
care
of
that
harvey
remarked
look
at
you
is
almost
enough
to
make
me
play
the
brutal
husband
and
say
that
i
be
hanged
if
you
go
out
tomorrow
at
all
she
laughed
a
ghostly
merriment
have
you
been
at
several
places
i
met
carnaby
at
lunch
she
added
quickly
told
me
he
was
going
somewhere
i
forget
oh
to
weymouth
to
see
mrs
larkfield
harvey
was
watching
her
and
paid
little
attention
to
the
news
you
know
it
would
much
surprise
me
if
you
could
get
up
tomorrow
morning
let
alone
play
at
a
concert
well
i
wo
keep
you
talking
go
to
bed
she
rose
but
instead
of
turning
to
the
door
moved
towards
where
harvey
was
sitting
be
angry
with
me
she
murmured
in
a
shamefaced
way
very
wise
i
myself
but
i
shall
be
all
right
tomorrow
and
afterwards
i
behave
more
sensibly
i
promise
he
nodded
but
alma
bent
over
him
and
touched
his
forehead
with
her
lips
in
a
fever
i
suppose
you
know
shall
be
all
right
tomorrow
goodnight
dear
in
town
this
morning
she
had
called
at
a
chemist
and
purchased
a
little
bottle
of
something
in
repute
for
fashionable
disorder
of
the
nerves
before
lying
down
she
took
the
prescribed
dose
though
with
small
hope
that
it
would
help
her
to
a
blessed
unconsciousness
another
thing
she
did
which
had
not
occurred
to
her
for
many
a
night
she
knelt
by
the
bedside
and
half
thought
half
whispered
through
tearless
sobs
a
petition
not
learnt
from
any
book
a
strange
blending
of
prayer
for
moral
strength
and
entreaty
for
success
in
a
worldly
desire
her
mind
shook
perilously
in
its
balance
it
was
well
for
alma
that
the
fashionable
prescription
did
not
fail
her
in
the
moment
of
despair
when
she
had
turned
and
turned
again
upon
her
pillow
haunted
by
a
vision
in
the
darkness
tortured
by
the
echo
of
a
dreadful
voice
there
fell
upon
her
a
sudden
quiet
her
brain
was
soothed
by
a
lulling
air
from
dreamland
her
limbs
relaxed
and
forgot
their
aching
weariness
she
sighed
and
slept
am
much
better
this
morning
she
said
at
breakfast
a
trace
of
fever
no
headache
a
face
the
colour
of
the
added
harvey
there
was
a
letter
from
frothingham
conveying
good
wishes
not
very
fervently
expressed
she
had
decided
not
to
come
up
for
the
concert
feeling
that
the
excitement
would
be
too
much
for
her
but
alma
suspected
another
reason
she
had
not
asked
her
husband
whether
he
meant
to
have
a
seat
in
prince
hall
this
afternoon
she
still
waited
for
him
to
speak
about
it
after
breakfast
he
asked
her
when
she
would
start
for
town
at
noon
she
replied
every
arrangement
had
been
completed
it
would
be
enough
if
she
reached
the
hall
half
an
hour
before
the
time
of
the
recital
and
after
a
light
luncheon
at
a
neighbouring
restaurant
we
may
as
well
go
together
said
her
husband
mean
to
come
then
she
asked
dreamily
shall
go
in
at
the
last
moment
a
seat
at
the
back
anything
but
inclined
for
conversation
alma
acquiesced
for
the
next
hour
or
two
she
kept
in
solitude
occasionally
touching
her
violin
but
always
recurring
to
an
absent
mood
a
troubled
reverie
she
could
not
fix
her
thoughts
upon
the
trial
that
was
before
her
in
a
vague
way
she
feared
it
but
another
fear
at
times
amounting
to
dread
dimmed
the
day
event
into
insignificance
the
morning
newspapers
were
before
her
sent
no
doubt
by
dymes
direction
and
she
mused
over
the
announcements
of
her
debut
harvey
rolfe
first
violin
recital
prince
hall
this
afternoon
at
it
gave
her
no
more
gratification
than
if
the
name
had
been
that
of
a
stranger
the
world
had
grown
as
unreal
as
a
nightmare
people
came
before
her
mind
people
the
most
intimately
known
and
she
seemed
but
faintly
to
recognise
them
they
were
all
so
much
changed
since
yesterday
their
relations
to
each
other
and
to
her
were
altered
confused
scarce
one
of
them
she
could
regard
without
apprehension
or
perplexity
what
faces
would
show
before
her
when
she
advanced
upon
the
platform
would
she
behold
sibyl
or
hugh
carnaby
or
cyrus
redgrave
their
presence
would
all
but
convince
her
that
she
had
passed
some
hours
of
yesterday
in
delirium
they
might
be
present
for
was
not
she
she
herself
about
to
step
forward
and
play
in
public
their
absence
what
would
it
mean
where
were
they
at
this
moment
what
had
happened
in
the
life
of
each
since
last
she
saw
them
when
it
was
time
to
begin
to
dress
she
undertook
the
task
with
effort
with
repugnance
she
would
have
chosen
to
sit
here
in
a
drowsy
idleness
and
let
the
hours
go
by
on
her
table
stood
the
little
vial
with
its
draught
of
oblivion
oh
to
drink
of
it
again
and
to
lay
her
head
upon
the
pillow
and
outsleep
the
day
nevertheless
when
she
had
exerted
herself
and
was
clad
in
the
fresh
garments
of
spring
the
mirror
came
to
her
help
she
was
pale
yet
but
pallor
lends
distinction
to
features
that
are
not
commonplace
and
no
remark
of
man
or
woman
had
ever
caused
her
to
suspect
that
her
face
was
ordinary
she
posed
before
the
glass
holding
her
violin
and
the
picture
seemed
so
effective
that
she
began
to
regain
courage
a
dreadful
thing
had
happened
perhaps
more
dreadful
than
she
durst
imagine
but
her
own
part
in
it
was
nothing
worse
than
folly
and
misfortune
she
had
no
irreparable
sin
to
hide
her
moment
of
supreme
peril
was
past
and
would
not
return
if
now
she
could
but
brace
her
nerves
and
pass
successfully
through
the
ordeal
of
the
next
few
hours
the
victory
for
which
she
had
striven
so
hard
and
had
risked
so
much
would
at
length
be
won
everything
dark
and
doubtful
she
must
try
to
forget
success
would
give
her
new
strength
to
fail
under
any
circumstances
ignominious
would
at
this
crisis
of
her
life
be
a
disaster
fraught
with
manifold
and
intolerable
shame
she
played
a
few
notes
her
hand
was
steady
once
more
she
felt
her
confidence
revive
whenever
she
had
performed
before
an
audience
it
had
always
seemed
to
her
that
she
must
inevitably
break
down
yet
at
the
last
minute
came
power
and
so
it
would
be
today
the
greater
the
demand
upon
her
so
much
the
surer
her
responsive
energy
she
would
not
see
faces
when
all
was
over
let
the
news
be
disclosed
the
worst
that
might
be
waiting
between
now
and
then
lay
an
infinity
of
time
so
when
she
went
downstairs
to
meet
harvey
the
change
in
her
appearance
surprised
him
he
had
expected
a
bloodless
countenance
a
tremulous
step
but
alma
came
towards
him
with
the
confident
carriage
of
an
earlier
day
with
her
smile
of
superiority
her
look
that
invited
or
demanded
admiration
you
wo
be
ashamed
of
me
tell
the
truth
said
harvey
was
going
because
i
feared
someone
would
have
to
look
after
you
in
the
middle
of
the
affair
if
there
no
danger
of
that
i
think
i
shall
not
go
into
the
place
at
all
do
care
for
it
i
prefer
to
hear
you
play
in
private
need
have
the
least
fear
for
me
said
alma
loftily
well
we
lunch
together
as
we
arranged
and
i
be
at
the
door
with
a
cab
for
you
after
the
people
have
gone
should
you
trouble
had
rather
if
you
do
mind
they
drove
from
baker
street
to
the
hall
where
alma
alighted
for
a
minute
to
leave
her
instrument
and
thence
to
a
restaurant
not
far
away
alma
felt
no
appetite
but
the
necessity
of
supporting
her
strength
obliged
her
to
choose
some
suitable
refreshment
when
their
order
had
been
given
harvey
laid
his
hand
upon
an
evening
newspaper
just
arrived
which
the
waiter
had
thrown
on
to
the
next
table
he
opened
it
not
with
any
intention
of
reading
but
because
he
had
no
mind
to
talk
alma
name
exhibited
in
staring
letters
at
the
entrance
of
the
public
building
had
oppressed
him
with
a
sense
of
degradation
he
felt
ignoble
much
as
a
man
might
feel
who
had
consented
to
his
own
dishonour
as
his
eyes
wandered
over
the
sheet
they
were
arrested
by
a
couple
of
bold
headlines
affair
at
wimbledon
mysterious
death
of
a
gentleman
he
read
the
paragraph
and
turned
to
alma
with
a
face
of
amazement
there
read
that
alma
took
the
paper
she
had
an
instantaneous
foreboding
of
what
she
was
to
see
her
heart
stood
still
and
her
eyes
dazzled
but
at
length
she
read
on
the
previous
evening
said
the
report
a
gentleman
residing
at
wimbledon
and
well
known
in
fashionable
circles
cyrus
redgrave
had
met
his
death
under
very
strange
and
startling
circumstances
only
a
few
particulars
could
as
yet
be
made
public
but
it
appeared
that
about
nine
in
the
evening
a
medical
man
had
been
hastily
summoned
to
redgrave
house
and
found
that
gentleman
lying
dead
in
a
room
that
opened
upon
the
garden
there
was
present
another
person
a
friend
of
the
deceased
name
not
mentioned
who
made
a
statement
to
the
effect
that
in
consequence
of
a
sudden
quarrel
he
had
struck
redgrave
with
his
fist
knocking
him
down
and
as
it
proved
killing
him
on
the
spot
up
to
the
present
moment
no
further
details
were
obtainable
but
it
was
believed
that
the
assailant
had
put
himself
in
communication
with
the
police
there
was
a
rumour
too
which
might
or
might
not
have
any
significance
that
redgrave
housekeeper
had
suddenly
left
the
house
and
could
not
be
traced
the
word
fell
from
her
lips
involuntarily
who
killed
him
said
harvey
just
above
his
breath
is
known
there
no
name
but
i
had
a
sudden
thought
absurd
impossible
as
harvey
whispered
the
words
a
waiter
drew
near
with
the
luncheon
it
was
arranged
upon
the
table
but
lay
there
disregarded
alma
took
up
the
newspaper
again
in
a
moment
she
leaned
towards
her
husband
did
you
think
do
talk
about
it
two
glasses
of
wine
had
been
poured
out
harvey
took
his
and
drank
it
off
a
pity
i
saw
this
he
said
has
shaken
your
nerves
i
ought
to
have
kept
it
to
myself
alma
dipped
a
spoon
in
the
soup
before
her
and
tried
to
swallow
her
hand
did
not
tremble
the
worst
had
come
and
gone
in
a
few
seconds
but
her
palate
refused
food
she
drank
wine
and
presently
became
so
collected
so
quiet
that
she
wondered
at
herself
cyrus
redgrave
was
dead
dead
the
word
kept
echoing
in
her
mind
as
soon
as
she
understood
and
believed
the
fact
of
redgrave
death
it
became
the
realisation
of
a
hope
which
she
had
entertained
without
knowing
it
only
by
a
great
effort
could
she
assume
the
look
of
natural
concern
had
she
been
in
solitude
her
face
would
have
relaxed
like
that
of
one
who
is
suddenly
relieved
from
physical
torment
she
gave
no
thought
to
wider
consequences
she
saw
the
event
only
as
it
affected
herself
in
her
relations
with
the
dead
man
she
had
feared
him
she
had
feared
herself
now
all
danger
was
at
an
end
now
now
she
could
find
courage
to
front
the
crowd
of
people
and
play
to
them
her
conscience
ceased
from
troubling
the
hope
of
triumph
no
longer
linked
itself
with
dread
of
a
fatal
indebtedness
no
touch
of
sorrow
entered
into
her
mood
no
anxiety
on
behalf
of
the
man
whose
act
had
freed
her
he
her
friend
would
keep
the
only
secret
which
could
now
injure
her
cyrus
redgrave
was
dead
and
to
her
it
meant
a
renewal
of
life
harvey
was
speaking
he
reminded
her
of
the
necessity
of
taking
food
i
am
going
to
eat
something
here
alma
he
regarded
her
sternly
you
have
any
fear
if
you
are
unequal
to
this
let
me
go
and
make
an
excuse
for
you
have
not
the
fear
do
try
to
make
me
nervous
she
ate
and
drank
harvey
the
while
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
newspaper
i
must
go
she
said
in
a
few
minutes
after
looking
at
her
watch
come
out
with
me
do
just
as
you
like
about
going
into
the
hall
and
about
meeting
me
afterwards
you
need
be
the
least
bit
anxious
i
assure
you
i
not
going
to
make
myself
ridiculous
they
stood
up
shall
be
at
the
door
with
a
cab
said
harvey
well
i
wo
keep
you
waiting
she
left
him
and
walked
from
the
restaurant
with
a
quick
step
harvey
drank
a
little
more
wine
and
made
a
pretence
of
tasting
the
dish
before
him
then
paid
his
bill
and
departed
he
had
now
no
intention
whatever
of
going
to
hear
alma
play
but
he
wished
to
know
whether
certain
persons
were
among
her
audience
and
as
he
could
not
stand
to
watch
the
people
entering
he
took
the
only
other
means
of
setting
his
mind
at
rest
this
was
to
drive
forthwith
to
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
on
his
knocking
at
the
carnabys
door
a
servant
informed
him
that
neither
her
master
nor
her
mistress
was
at
home
something
unusual
in
the
girl
manner
at
once
arrested
his
attention
she
was
evidently
disinclined
to
say
anything
beyond
the
formula
of
refusal
but
with
this
harvey
would
not
be
satisfied
he
mentioned
his
name
and
urged
several
inquiries
on
the
plea
that
he
had
urgent
business
with
his
friends
all
he
could
gather
was
that
carnaby
had
left
home
early
this
morning
and
that
carnaby
was
out
of
town
it
grew
more
evident
that
the
girl
shrank
from
questions
anyone
been
here
before
me
anxious
to
see
them
do
know
sir
i
ca
tell
you
anything
else
you
have
no
idea
when
either
of
them
will
be
back
do
know
at
all
i
do
know
anything
about
it
he
turned
away
as
if
to
descend
the
stairs
but
as
there
was
no
sound
of
a
closing
door
he
glanced
back
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
servant
who
stood
looking
after
him
no
sooner
did
their
eyes
meet
than
the
girl
drew
hastily
in
and
the
door
was
shut
beset
by
a
grave
uneasiness
he
walked
into
edgware
road
and
followed
the
thoroughfare
to
its
end
at
the
marble
arch
one
thing
seemed
certain
neither
carnaby
nor
his
wife
could
be
at
prince
hall
it
was
equally
certain
that
only
a
serious
cause
could
have
prevented
their
attendance
the
servant
manifestly
had
something
to
conceal
under
ordinary
circumstances
she
would
never
have
spoken
and
behaved
in
that
strange
way
at
the
marble
arch
boys
were
crying
newspapers
he
bought
two
and
in
each
of
them
found
the
sensational
headlines
but
the
reports
added
nothing
to
that
he
had
already
seen
all
it
was
clear
came
from
the
same
source
he
turned
into
the
park
and
walked
aimlessly
by
crosspaths
hither
and
thither
time
had
to
be
killed
he
tried
to
read
his
papers
but
every
item
of
news
or
comment
disgusted
him
and
he
threw
the
sheets
away
when
he
came
out
at
knightsbridge
there
was
still
half
an
hour
to
be
passed
so
he
turned
eastward
and
walked
the
length
of
piccadilly
now
at
length
alma
fate
was
decided
the
concert
drew
to
its
close
in
anxiety
to
learn
how
things
had
gone
with
her
he
all
but
forgot
hugh
carnaby
until
just
as
he
was
about
to
hail
a
cab
for
the
purpose
of
bringing
alma
from
the
hall
his
eye
fell
on
a
fresh
newspaper
placard
which
gave
its
largest
type
to
the
wimbledon
affair
and
promised
a
revelation
he
bought
the
paper
and
read
it
had
become
known
said
the
reporter
that
the
gentleman
who
on
his
own
avowal
had
caused
redgrave
death
was
carnaby
resident
at
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
the
rumour
that
carnaby
had
presented
himself
to
the
authorities
was
unfounded
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
police
had
heard
nothing
from
him
and
could
not
discover
his
whereabouts
as
to
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
housekeeper
lant
by
name
nothing
new
could
be
learnt
lant
had
left
all
her
personal
belongings
and
no
one
seemed
able
to
conjecture
a
reason
for
her
conduct
harvey
folded
up
the
paper
and
crushed
it
into
his
pocket
he
felt
no
surprise
his
brooding
on
possibilities
had
prepared
him
for
this
disclosure
and
from
the
moment
that
his
fears
were
confirmed
he
interpreted
everything
with
a
gloomy
certainty
hugh
fatal
violence
could
have
but
one
explanation
and
that
did
not
come
upon
harvey
with
the
shock
of
the
incredible
neither
was
he
at
any
loss
to
understand
why
hugh
had
failed
to
surrender
himself
the
newspapers
would
rejoice
in
another
revelation
which
would
make
the
tragedy
complete
in
this
state
of
mind
he
waited
for
alma
coming
forth
she
was
punctual
as
she
had
promised
at
the
first
sight
of
her
he
knew
that
nothing
disagreeable
had
befallen
and
this
was
enough
as
soon
as
the
cab
drove
off
with
them
he
looked
an
inquiry
well
she
answered
with
subdued
exultation
till
you
see
the
notices
her
flushed
face
and
dancing
eyes
told
that
she
was
fresh
from
congratulation
and
flattery
harvey
could
not
spoil
her
moment
of
triumph
by
telling
what
he
had
just
learnt
she
wished
to
talk
of
herself
and
he
gave
her
the
opportunity
people
very
good
hall
they
say
such
an
audience
at
a
first
recital
has
hardly
ever
been
known
were
nervous
often
been
far
more
when
i
played
in
a
and
i
never
played
so
well
not
half
so
well
she
entered
upon
a
vivid
description
of
her
feelings
on
first
stepping
forward
she
could
see
nothing
but
a
misty
expanse
of
faces
she
could
not
feel
the
boards
she
trod
upon
yet
no
sooner
had
she
raised
her
violin
than
a
glorious
sense
of
power
made
her
forget
everything
but
the
music
she
was
to
play
she
all
but
laughed
with
delight
never
had
she
felt
so
perfect
a
mastery
of
her
instrument
she
played
without
effort
and
could
have
played
for
hours
without
weariness
her
declared
that
she
was
and
harvey
as
he
listened
to
this
flow
of
excited
talk
asked
himself
whether
he
had
not
after
all
judged
alma
amiss
perhaps
he
had
been
the
mere
dull
philistine
unable
to
recognise
the
born
artist
and
doing
his
paltry
best
to
obstruct
her
path
perhaps
so
but
he
would
look
for
the
opinion
of
serious
critics
if
any
such
had
been
present
at
baker
street
they
had
to
wait
for
a
train
and
here
it
happened
that
alma
saw
the
evening
placards
at
once
she
changed
her
countenance
was
darkened
with
anxiety
you
better
get
a
paper
she
asked
in
a
quick
undertone
have
one
do
you
wish
to
see
it
now
there
anything
more
there
is
you
do
know
i
suppose
whether
carnaby
and
his
wife
were
at
the
hall
could
hardly
distinguish
faces
she
replied
with
tremor
is
it
tell
me
he
took
out
his
newspaper
and
pointed
to
the
paragraph
which
mentioned
carnaby
name
alma
seemed
overcome
with
painful
emotion
she
moved
towards
the
nearest
seat
and
harvey
alarmed
by
her
sudden
pallor
placed
himself
by
her
side
does
it
mean
she
whispered
can
say
must
have
quarrelled
about
business
matters
so
you
think
he
carnaby
means
to
hide
away
to
escape
wo
hide
away
harvey
answered
he
may
escape
do
you
mean
go
by
ship
get
out
of
the
country
do
think
so
he
is
far
more
likely
to
be
found
somewhere
in
a
way
that
would
save
trouble
alma
flashed
a
look
of
intelligence
think
so
she
panted
really
think
he
has
done
that
feel
afraid
of
it
alma
recovered
breath
and
but
that
her
face
was
bent
low
over
the
newspaper
harvey
must
have
observed
that
the
possibility
of
his
friend
suicide
seemed
rather
to
calm
her
agitation
than
to
afflict
her
with
fresh
dismay
but
she
could
speak
no
more
of
her
musical
triumph
with
the
colour
of
her
cheeks
she
had
lost
all
animation
all
energy
she
needed
the
support
of
harvey
arm
in
stepping
to
the
railway
carriage
and
on
her
arrival
at
home
yielding
as
it
seemed
to
physical
exhaustion
she
lay
pallid
mute
and
nerveless
chapter
at
night
she
had
recourse
to
the
little
bottle
but
this
time
it
was
less
efficacious
again
and
again
she
woke
from
terrifying
dreams
wearied
utterly
unable
to
rest
and
longing
for
the
dawn
soon
after
daybreak
she
arose
and
dressed
then
as
there
was
yet
no
sound
of
movement
in
the
house
she
laid
her
aching
head
upon
the
pillow
again
and
once
more
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
the
usual
call
aroused
her
she
went
to
the
door
and
bade
the
servant
bring
her
some
tea
and
the
morning
paper
as
soon
as
it
was
delivered
in
a
few
minutes
the
tea
and
the
newspaper
were
both
brought
first
she
glanced
at
the
paragraphs
relating
to
the
wimbledon
tragedy
there
was
nothing
added
to
yesterday
news
except
that
the
inquest
would
be
held
this
morning
then
she
looked
eagerly
for
the
report
of
her
recital
and
found
it
only
after
much
searching
barely
a
dozen
lines
which
spoke
of
her
as
lady
of
some
artistic
promise
said
that
much
allowance
must
be
made
for
her
natural
nervousness
and
passed
on
to
the
other
performers
who
were
unreservedly
praised
anger
and
despondency
struggled
within
her
as
she
read
the
lines
over
and
over
again
nervous
why
the
one
marvellous
thing
was
her
absolute
conquest
of
nervousness
she
saw
the
hand
of
an
enemy
felix
dymes
had
warned
her
of
the
envy
she
must
look
for
in
certain
quarters
and
here
appeared
the
first
instance
of
it
but
the
post
would
bring
other
papers
it
brought
half
a
dozen
and
a
number
of
letters
at
the
sound
of
the
knock
alma
hurried
downstairs
seized
upon
her
budget
and
returned
to
the
bedroom
yes
as
it
happened
she
had
seen
the
least
favourable
notice
first
of
all
the
other
papers
devoted
more
space
to
her
though
less
than
she
had
expected
and
harmonised
in
their
tone
of
compliment
one
went
so
far
as
to
congratulate
those
who
were
present
on
occasion
of
undoubted
importance
another
found
some
fault
with
her
choice
of
pieces
but
hoped
soon
to
hear
her
again
for
her
to
more
than
ordinary
attention
were
there
was
a
certain
lack
of
opined
one
critic
but
nervousness
promise
promise
all
agreed
that
her
was
quite
exceptional
tremulous
from
these
lines
of
print
she
turned
to
the
letters
and
here
was
with
flattery
most
brilliant
debut
shall
we
thank
you
for
such
an
artistic
treat
your
divine
rendering
of
have
taken
your
place
at
once
and
in
the
very
front
rank
of
violinists
she
smiled
once
more
and
lost
a
little
of
her
cadaverous
hue
felix
dymes
scribbling
late
repeated
things
that
he
had
heard
since
the
afternoon
he
added
afraid
you
be
awfully
upset
about
your
friends
the
carnabys
very
unfortunate
this
should
have
happened
just
now
but
cheer
up
and
let
me
see
you
as
soon
as
possible
great
things
to
come
she
went
down
to
breakfast
with
shaking
limbs
scarce
able
to
hold
up
her
head
as
she
sat
through
the
meal
harvey
ran
his
eye
over
the
papers
but
said
nothing
and
kept
looking
anxiously
at
her
she
could
not
touch
food
on
rising
from
table
she
felt
a
giddiness
which
obliged
her
to
hold
the
chair
for
support
at
her
husband
beckoning
she
followed
him
into
the
library
you
better
go
back
to
bed
shall
lie
down
a
little
but
perhaps
if
i
could
get
out
that
you
wo
and
if
you
feel
no
better
by
afternoon
i
shall
send
for
the
doctor
see
what
the
papers
say
it
be
graceful
to
own
that
you
are
surprised
talk
about
that
when
you
look
less
like
a
corpse
would
you
like
me
to
send
any
message
to
mrs
carnaby
alma
shook
her
head
write
today
or
tomorrow
there
no
hurry
hurry
said
rolfe
surprised
by
something
in
her
tone
do
you
mean
by
that
you
going
to
see
mr
carnaby
was
her
answer
do
know
where
to
find
him
unless
i
go
to
the
inquest
had
rather
you
stayed
here
today
said
alma
feel
far
from
well
i
shall
stay
but
i
ought
to
let
him
hear
from
me
best
perhaps
if
i
send
a
telegram
to
his
place
the
morning
passed
miserably
enough
alma
went
to
her
bedroom
and
lay
there
for
an
hour
or
two
then
she
strayed
to
the
nursery
and
sat
a
while
with
hugh
and
his
governess
at
luncheon
she
had
no
more
appetite
than
at
breakfast
though
for
very
faintness
her
body
could
scarce
support
itself
after
the
meal
harvey
went
out
to
procure
the
earliest
evening
papers
and
on
his
way
he
called
at
the
doctor
house
not
till
about
five
was
a
report
of
the
wimbledon
inquest
obtainable
having
read
it
harvey
took
the
paper
home
where
he
arrived
just
as
the
doctor
drove
up
to
the
door
alma
was
again
lying
down
her
eyes
showed
that
she
had
shed
tears
on
harvey
saying
that
the
doctor
was
in
the
house
she
answered
briefly
that
she
would
see
him
the
result
of
the
interview
was
made
known
to
rolfe
nervous
collapse
care
and
quiet
excitement
of
any
kind
to
be
avoided
the
patient
better
in
bed
for
a
few
days
to
obtain
complete
rest
avoidance
of
excitement
was
the
most
difficult
of
all
things
for
alma
at
present
newspapers
could
not
be
kept
from
her
she
waited
eagerly
for
the
report
of
the
inquest
tells
an
astonishing
story
said
rolfe
as
he
sat
down
by
her
when
the
doctor
was
gone
me
read
it
for
myself
she
did
so
with
every
sign
of
agitation
but
on
laying
the
paper
aside
she
seemed
to
become
quieter
after
a
short
silence
a
word
or
two
fell
from
her
sibyl
was
at
weymouth
harvey
communed
with
his
thoughts
which
were
anything
but
pleasant
he
did
not
doubt
the
truth
of
hugh
carnaby
narrative
but
he
had
a
gloomy
conviction
that
whether
hugh
knew
it
or
not
an
essential
part
of
the
drama
lay
unrevealed
they
find
that
woman
do
you
think
were
alma
next
words
does
seem
very
likely
is
the
punishment
for
manslaughter
depends
the
case
will
go
for
trial
and
in
the
meantime
asked
alma
raising
herself
woman
be
found
there
was
another
silence
then
alma
asked
you
think
i
ought
to
write
to
sibyl
he
answered
decisively
must
write
to
no
one
put
it
all
out
of
your
mind
as
much
as
possible
you
see
mr
carnaby
if
he
sends
for
me
and
this
was
just
what
happened
admitted
to
bail
by
the
magistrate
hugh
presently
sent
a
note
from
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
asking
his
friend
to
see
him
there
harvey
did
not
let
alma
know
of
it
he
found
some
difficulty
in
getting
away
from
home
for
a
couple
of
hours
so
anxious
had
she
become
to
keep
him
within
call
and
when
he
of
necessity
went
out
to
be
informed
of
his
movements
he
attributed
this
to
her
morbid
condition
for
in
truth
alma
was
very
she
could
take
only
the
lightest
food
and
in
the
smallest
quantities
she
fell
repeatedly
into
fits
of
silent
weeping
she
had
lost
all
strength
and
her
flesh
had
begun
to
waste
on
this
same
day
harvey
heard
that
mrs
frothingham
was
making
ready
to
come
and
the
news
relieved
him
on
reaching
the
carnabys
he
was
admitted
by
the
same
servant
whose
behaviour
had
excited
his
suspicions
a
day
or
two
ago
without
a
word
she
conducted
him
to
hugh
room
old
man
said
the
familiar
voice
though
in
the
tone
of
one
who
is
afraid
of
being
overheard
has
come
to
this
you
see
you
not
surprised
what
else
could
be
expected
of
a
fellow
like
me
sooner
or
later
his
face
had
the
marks
of
sleeplessness
his
hand
was
hot
he
pressed
harvey
into
a
chair
and
stood
before
him
making
an
obvious
effort
to
look
and
speak
courageously
never
struck
me
before
how
devilish
awkward
it
is
for
a
man
in
his
own
home
when
he
gets
into
a
public
scrape
i
mean
the
servants
one
has
to
sit
under
them
as
usual
you
know
and
feel
their
eyes
boring
into
one
back
did
you
ever
think
of
it
long
have
you
to
wait
asked
rolfe
a
fortnight
but
there
may
be
bother
about
that
woman
i
wish
to
god
they
could
catch
her
harvey
made
no
reply
and
his
eyes
wandered
in
a
moment
he
became
aware
that
hugh
was
looking
at
him
with
peculiar
intentness
wish
i
could
do
anything
for
you
carnaby
can
replied
the
other
with
emphasis
his
face
growing
stern
is
it
rid
of
that
ugly
thought
i
see
you
have
in
your
mind
hugh
voice
though
still
cautious
had
risen
a
little
he
spoke
with
severity
that
was
almost
harshness
their
eyes
met
ugly
thought
be
dishonest
with
me
rolfe
it
a
tale
and
you
not
the
only
man
i
warrant
who
thinks
there
something
behind
it
but
i
tell
you
there
is
or
nothing
that
concerns
he
paused
for
an
instant
should
have
dared
to
tell
it
but
for
my
wife
yes
my
wife
he
repeated
vehemently
was
sibyl
forced
me
to
tell
the
truth
rather
than
have
mixed
up
in
such
a
thing
as
this
i
would
have
told
any
lie
at
whatever
cost
to
myself
but
she
would
let
me
and
she
was
right
i
see
now
that
she
was
though
it
a
been
hard
enough
i
tell
you
to
think
of
what
people
might
be
saying
damn
them
do
you
be
one
rolfe
my
wife
is
as
pure
and
innocent
as
any
woman
living
i
tell
you
that
i
ask
you
to
believe
that
and
it
the
one
thing
the
only
thing
you
can
do
for
me
his
voice
quivered
and
he
upon
the
passionate
words
moved
though
not
to
conviction
harvey
made
the
only
possible
reply
believe
you
and
if
ever
i
have
the
chance
i
will
repeat
what
you
say
well
but
there
something
else
i
do
ask
you
to
see
anything
of
sibyl
or
to
let
your
wife
see
her
it
will
be
much
better
not
i
do
know
whether
she
will
stay
here
or
in
london
at
all
but
she
will
see
as
few
people
as
possible
do
think
it
necessary
to
write
to
her
do
let
your
wife
write
if
we
all
live
through
it
and
come
out
again
on
the
other
side
things
may
be
all
right
again
but
i
look
forward
to
anything
all
i
can
think
of
now
is
that
i
killed
a
man
who
was
a
good
friend
to
me
and
have
darkened
all
the
rest
of
sibyl
life
and
i
only
wish
someone
had
knocked
my
brains
out
ten
years
ago
when
nobody
would
have
missed
such
a
blackguard
and
ruffian
it
on
your
wife
account
or
on
ours
that
you
want
us
to
keep
apart
asked
rolfe
gravely
my
dear
fellow
was
the
equally
grave
reply
saying
only
what
i
mean
it
no
time
for
humbug
now
think
it
over
and
you
see
i
right
wo
see
any
one
just
yet
awhile
said
harvey
has
made
herself
ill
of
course
how
concert
and
the
frenzy
that
went
before
it
concert
carnaby
touched
his
forehead
remember
if
i
were
you
rolfe
do
want
to
take
advantage
of
my
position
and
be
impertinent
but
do
you
think
that
kind
of
thing
will
do
her
any
good
in
the
end
going
to
stop
replied
harvey
with
a
meaning
nod
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
very
glad
just
stick
to
that
more
civilised
than
i
am
and
you
know
how
to
go
about
that
kind
of
thing
as
a
man
should
mean
to
try
is
not
seriously
ill
i
hope
hugh
inquired
after
reflecting
for
a
moment
the
nerves
breakdown
nothing
dangerous
i
believe
ought
to
be
easy
enough
for
you
rolfe
said
the
other
at
home
here
depends
what
you
mean
by
here
i
at
home
in
england
no
doubt
but
it
very
uncertain
whether
i
shall
hold
out
in
london
you
know
that
we
going
west
to
gunnersbury
that
on
the
child
account
i
want
him
to
go
to
school
with
a
friend
of
ours
if
we
can
live
there
quietly
and
sanely
well
and
good
if
the
whirlpool
begins
to
drag
us
in
again
then
i
have
another
idea
whirlpool
muttered
carnaby
with
a
broken
laugh
got
hold
of
and
i
going
down
old
man
and
it
looks
black
as
hell
shall
see
the
sunlight
again
together
replied
rolfe
with
forced
cheerfulness
think
so
i
wish
i
could
believe
it
in
less
than
half
an
hour
harvey
was
back
at
the
station
waiting
for
his
train
he
suffered
pangs
of
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
ought
to
have
found
some
better
way
in
word
or
deed
for
manifesting
the
sympathy
of
true
friendship
he
had
betrayed
a
doubt
which
must
for
ever
affect
hugh
feeling
towards
him
but
this
was
his
lot
in
life
to
blunder
amid
trying
circumstances
to
prove
unequal
to
every
grave
call
upon
him
he
tried
vainly
to
see
what
else
he
could
have
done
yet
felt
that
another
man
would
have
faced
the
situation
to
better
purpose
one
resolve
at
all
events
he
had
brought
out
of
it
hugh
reference
to
alma
declared
the
view
of
a
difficulty
which
ought
to
be
no
difficulty
at
all
and
put
an
end
to
vacillation
but
in
return
for
this
friendly
service
he
had
rendered
nothing
save
a
few
words
of
encouragement
rolfe
saw
himself
in
a
mean
dispiriting
light
on
the
next
day
frothingham
arrived
at
pinner
and
anxieties
were
lightened
the
good
capable
woman
never
showed
to
such
advantage
as
in
a
scarcely
had
she
entered
the
house
when
alma
state
began
to
improve
they
remarked
that
alma
showed
no
great
concern
on
sibyl
account
but
was
seemingly
preoccupied
with
thought
of
carnaby
himself
this
being
the
case
it
was
with
solicitude
that
harvey
and
frothingham
awaited
the
result
of
hugh
trial
for
manslaughter
redgrave
housekeeper
could
not
be
found
the
man
stood
or
fell
by
his
own
testimony
nothing
was
submitted
to
the
court
beyond
the
fact
of
redgrave
death
and
hugh
carnaby
explanation
of
how
it
came
about
nothing
of
direct
evidence
indirect
in
the
shape
of
witness
to
character
was
abundantly
forthcoming
and
from
of
importance
but
the
victim
also
was
a
person
of
importance
and
justice
no
doubt
felt
that
under
whatever
provocation
such
a
man
must
not
be
slain
with
impunity
it
sentenced
the
homicide
to
a
term
of
two
years
imprisonment
without
hard
labour
alma
heard
the
sentence
with
little
emotion
soon
after
she
fell
into
a
deeper
and
more
refreshing
sleep
than
any
she
had
known
since
her
illness
began
is
the
end
of
suspense
said
frothingham
doubt
harvey
assented
a
few
days
more
and
frothingham
took
alma
away
into
hampshire
little
hugh
went
with
them
his
mother
strongly
desiring
it
as
for
rolfe
he
escaped
to
greystone
to
spend
a
week
with
basil
morton
before
facing
the
miseries
of
the
removal
from
pinner
to
gunnersbury
part
the
third
chapter
the
house
had
stood
for
a
century
and
a
half
and
for
eighty
years
had
been
inhabited
by
mortons
of
its
neighbours
in
the
road
one
or
two
were
yet
older
all
had
reached
the
age
of
mellowness
umbra
praeterit
dies
so
ran
the
motto
of
the
dial
set
between
porch
and
eaves
to
harvey
rolfe
the
kindliest
of
all
greetings
welcoming
him
to
such
tranquillity
as
he
knew
not
how
to
find
elsewhere
it
was
in
the
town
yet
nothing
no
sooty
smother
hung
above
the
and
smirched
the
garden
leafage
no
tramp
of
crowds
no
clatter
of
traffic
sounded
from
the
streets
hard
by
but
at
hours
familiar
bidding
to
task
or
pleasure
or
repose
the
music
of
the
grey
belfries
floated
overhead
a
voice
from
the
old
time
an
admonition
of
mortality
in
strains
sweet
to
the
ear
of
childhood
harvey
had
but
to
listen
and
the
days
of
long
ago
came
back
to
him
above
all
when
at
evening
rang
the
curfew
stealing
apart
to
a
bowered
corner
of
the
garden
he
dreamed
himself
into
the
vanished
years
when
was
and
a
hand
with
gentle
touch
led
him
from
his
play
to
that
long
sweet
slumber
which
is
the
child
new
birth
basil
morton
was
one
of
three
brothers
the
youngest
his
father
a
assenting
readily
to
his
early
inclination
for
the
church
sent
him
from
greystone
to
cambridge
where
basil
passed
creditably
through
the
routine
but
in
no
way
distinguished
himself
having
taken
his
degree
he
felt
less
assured
of
a
clerical
vocation
and
thought
that
the
law
might
perhaps
be
more
suitable
to
him
whilst
he
thus
wavered
his
father
died
and
the
young
man
found
that
he
had
to
depend
upon
himself
for
anything
more
than
the
barest
livelihood
he
decided
after
all
for
business
and
became
a
partner
with
his
eldest
brother
handling
corn
as
his
father
and
his
grandfather
had
done
before
him
at
eight
and
twenty
he
married
and
a
few
years
afterwards
the
elder
morton
death
left
him
to
pursue
commerce
at
his
own
discretion
latterly
the
business
had
not
been
very
lucrative
nor
was
basil
the
man
to
make
it
so
but
he
went
steadily
on
in
the
old
tracks
satisfied
with
an
income
which
kept
him
free
from
care
like
my
trade
he
said
once
to
harvey
rolfe
clean
and
sweet
and
useful
the
socialist
would
revile
me
as
a
middleman
but
society
ca
do
without
me
just
yet
and
i
ask
no
more
than
i
fairly
earn
i
like
turning
over
a
sample
of
grain
i
like
the
touch
of
it
and
the
smell
of
it
it
brings
me
near
to
the
good
old
mother
earth
and
makes
me
feel
human
his
house
was
spacious
well
built
comfortable
the
furniture
in
great
part
was
the
same
his
parents
had
used
solid
mahogany
not
so
beautiful
as
furniture
may
be
made
but
serviceable
if
need
be
for
another
fifty
years
he
had
a
library
of
several
thousand
volumes
slowly
and
prudently
collected
representing
a
liberal
interest
in
all
travail
of
the
mind
and
a
special
taste
for
the
things
of
classical
antiquity
basil
morton
was
no
scholar
in
the
modern
sense
but
might
well
have
been
described
by
the
old
phrase
which
links
scholar
with
gentleman
he
lived
by
trade
but
trade
did
not
affect
his
life
the
day
work
over
he
turned
with
no
feeling
of
incongruity
to
a
page
of
thucydides
of
tacitus
or
to
those
less
familiar
authors
who
lighted
his
favourite
wanderings
through
the
ruins
of
the
roman
empire
better
grounded
for
such
studies
than
harvey
rolfe
he
pursued
them
with
a
steadier
devotion
and
with
all
the
advantages
of
domestic
peace
in
his
mental
habits
in
his
turns
of
speech
there
appeared
perhaps
a
leaning
to
pedantry
but
it
was
the
most
amiable
of
faults
and
any
danger
that
might
have
lurked
in
it
was
most
happily
balanced
and
corrected
by
the
practical
virtues
of
his
life
companion
morton
had
the
beauty
of
perfect
health
of
health
mental
and
physical
to
describe
her
face
as
homely
was
to
pay
it
the
highest
compliment
for
its
smile
was
the
true
light
of
home
that
never
failed
daughter
of
a
house
that
bred
gentlewomen
though
its
ability
to
dower
them
had
declined
in
these
latter
days
she
conceived
her
duty
as
wife
and
mother
after
the
old
fashion
and
was
so
fortunate
as
to
find
no
obstacle
in
circumstance
she
rose
early
she
slept
early
and
her
day
was
full
of
manifold
activity
four
children
she
had
borne
the
eldest
a
boy
now
in
his
twelfth
year
the
youngest
a
baby
girl
and
it
seemed
to
her
no
merit
that
in
these
little
ones
she
saw
the
end
and
reason
of
her
being
into
her
pure
and
healthy
mind
had
never
entered
a
thought
at
conflict
with
motherhood
her
breasts
were
the
fountain
of
life
her
babies
clung
to
them
and
grew
large
of
limb
from
her
they
learnt
to
speak
from
her
they
learnt
the
names
of
trees
and
flowers
and
all
things
beautiful
around
them
learnt
too
less
by
precept
than
from
fair
example
the
sweetness
and
sincerity
wherewith
such
mothers
and
such
alone
can
endow
their
offspring
later
she
was
their
instructress
in
a
more
formal
sense
for
this
also
she
held
to
be
her
duty
up
to
the
point
where
other
teaching
became
needful
by
method
and
she
found
time
for
everything
ruling
her
house
and
ordering
her
life
so
admirably
that
to
those
who
saw
her
only
in
hours
of
leisure
she
seemed
to
be
at
leisure
always
she
would
have
felt
it
an
impossible
thing
to
abandon
her
children
to
the
care
of
servants
reluctantly
she
left
them
even
for
an
hour
or
two
when
other
claims
which
could
not
be
neglected
called
her
forth
in
they
desired
no
better
companion
for
she
was
a
child
herself
in
gaiety
of
heart
and
lissom
sportiveness
no
prettier
sight
could
be
seen
at
greystone
than
when
on
a
summer
afternoon
they
all
drove
in
the
pony
carriage
to
call
on
friends
or
out
into
the
country
nowadays
it
was
often
her
eldest
boy
who
held
the
reins
a
lad
a
pupil
at
the
old
where
he
used
the
desk
at
which
his
father
had
sat
before
him
whatever
fault
of
boyhood
showed
itself
in
harry
morton
he
knew
not
the
common
temptation
to
be
ashamed
of
his
mother
or
to
flout
her
love
for
holiday
they
never
crossed
the
sea
morton
himself
had
been
but
once
abroad
and
that
in
the
year
before
his
father
death
when
he
was
trying
to
make
up
his
mind
what
profession
he
should
take
up
he
then
saw
something
of
france
and
of
italy
talking
with
travelled
friends
he
was
wont
to
praise
himself
in
humorous
vein
for
the
sober
fixity
of
his
life
and
to
quote
in
that
mellow
tone
which
gave
such
charm
to
his
talk
the
line
from
claudian
et
extremos
alter
scrutetur
for
he
had
several
friends
to
whom
a
latin
or
a
greek
quotation
was
no
certain
of
his
college
companions
men
who
had
come
to
hold
a
place
in
the
world
eye
were
glad
to
turn
aside
from
beaten
tracks
and
smoke
a
pipe
at
greystone
with
basil
morton
the
quaint
fellow
who
at
a
casual
glance
might
pass
for
a
philistine
but
was
indeed
something
quite
other
his
wife
had
never
left
her
native
island
will
go
abroad
she
said
my
boys
can
take
me
and
that
might
not
be
long
hence
for
harry
who
loved
no
book
so
much
as
the
atlas
abounded
in
schemes
of
travel
and
had
already
mapped
the
grand
tour
on
which
the
whole
family
was
to
set
forth
when
he
stood
headboy
at
the
in
this
household
harvey
rolfe
knew
himself
a
welcome
guest
and
never
had
he
been
so
glad
as
now
to
pass
from
the
noisy
world
into
the
calm
which
always
fell
about
him
under
his
friend
roof
the
miseries
through
which
he
had
gone
were
troubling
his
health
and
health
disordered
naturally
reacted
upon
his
mind
so
that
owing
to
a
gloomy
excitement
of
the
imagination
for
several
nights
he
had
hardly
slept
no
sooner
had
he
lain
down
in
darkness
than
every
form
of
mortal
anguish
beset
his
thoughts
passing
before
him
as
though
some
hand
unfolded
a
pictured
scroll
of
life
terrors
he
seemed
never
before
to
have
realised
the
infinitude
of
human
suffering
hour
after
hour
with
brief
intervals
of
from
which
his
mind
awoke
in
nameless
horror
he
travelled
from
land
to
land
from
age
to
age
at
one
moment
picturing
some
dread
incident
of
a
thousand
years
ago
the
next
beholding
with
intolerable
vividness
some
scene
of
agony
reported
in
the
day
newspaper
doubtless
it
came
of
his
constant
brooding
on
redgrave
death
and
hugh
carnaby
punishment
for
the
first
time
tragedy
had
been
brought
near
to
him
and
he
marvelled
at
the
indifference
with
which
men
habitually
live
in
a
world
where
tragedy
is
every
hour
occurrence
he
told
himself
that
this
was
merely
a
morbid
condition
of
the
brain
but
could
not
bring
himself
to
believe
it
on
the
contrary
what
he
now
saw
and
felt
was
the
simple
truth
of
things
obscured
by
everyday
conditions
of
active
life
and
that
history
which
he
loved
to
read
what
was
it
but
the
lurid
record
of
woes
unutterable
how
could
he
find
pleasure
in
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
century
after
century
of
torment
war
pestilence
tyranny
the
stake
the
dungeon
tortures
of
infinite
device
cruelties
inconceivable
he
would
close
his
books
and
try
to
forget
all
they
had
taught
him
tonight
he
spoke
of
it
as
he
sat
with
morton
after
everyone
else
had
gone
to
bed
they
had
talked
of
hugh
carnaby
each
divining
in
the
other
a
suspicion
they
were
careful
not
to
avow
and
their
mood
led
naturally
to
interchange
of
thoughts
on
grave
subjects
knows
that
state
of
mind
more
or
less
said
morton
in
his
dreamy
voice
a
voice
good
for
the
nerves
comes
generally
when
one
stomach
is
out
of
order
you
wake
at
two
in
the
morning
and
suffer
infernally
from
the
blackest
pessimism
morbid
yes
but
for
all
that
it
may
be
a
glimpse
of
the
truth
health
and
good
spirits
just
as
likely
as
not
are
the
deceptive
condition
but
for
the
power
of
deceiving
ourselves
we
could
live
at
all
it
not
a
question
of
theory
but
of
fact
fought
it
out
with
myself
said
basil
after
a
sip
of
whisky
the
time
of
my
exodus
from
houndsditch
there
a
point
in
the
life
of
every
man
who
has
brains
when
it
becomes
a
possibility
that
he
may
kill
himself
most
of
us
have
it
early
but
it

was
like
johnson
friend
be
as
philosophical
as
i
might
cheerfulness
kept
breaking
in

at
last
i
let
cheerfulness
have
its
way
as
far
as
i
know

gurgled
a
laugh
did
the
same
harvey
puffed
at
his
pipe
before
answering
and
i
suppose
we
may
call
that
intellectual
maturity
it
bad
for
a
man
when
he
mature
which
is
my
case
i
seem
to
be
as
far
from
it
as
ever
seriously
i
should
think
few
men
ever
had
so
slow
a
development
i
do
stagnate
there
always

putting
aside
the
religious
question
my
stage
at
present
is
yours
of
twenty
years
ago
yet
not
even
that
for
you
started
better
than
i
did
you
were
never
a
selfish
lout
a
blackguard
you
either
my
dear
fellow
i
was
i
got
along
fairly
well
in

can
follow
my
course
in
the
past
clearly
enough
if
i
had
my
rights
i
should
live
to
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
and
go
on
ripening
to
the
end
that
would
be
a
fair
proportion
it
confoundedly
hard
to
think
that
i
a
good
deal
past
the
middle
of
life
yet
morally
and
intellectually
am
only
beginning
it
only
means
rolfe
that
we
others
have
a
pretty
solid
conceit
of
listen
we
have
heard
the
chimes
at
midnight
master
shallow
i
do
apply
the
name
to
you
but
you
be
none
the
worse
for
a
good
night
sleep
let
us
be
off
harvey
slept
much
better
than
of
late
there
was
an
air
of
comfort
in
this
which
lulled
the
mind
not
that
the
appointments
were
more
luxurious
than
in
his
own
bedroom
for
morton
had
neither
the
means
nor
the
desire
to
equip
his
house
with
perfections
of
modern
upholstery
but
every
detail
manifested
a
care
and
taste
and
delicacy
found
only
in
homes
which
are
homes
indeed
and
not
mere
fitted
up
chiefly
for
display
harvey
thought
of
the
happiness
of
children
who
are
born
and
live
through
all
their
childhood
in
such
an
atmosphere
as
this
then
he
thought
of
his
own
child
who
had
in
truth
no
home
at
all
a
house
in
wales
a
house
at
pinner
a
house
at
gunnersbury
presently
a
house
somewhere
else
he
had
heard
people
defend
this
nomad
life
why
he
himself
before
his
marriage
had
smiled
at
the
stability
represented
by
such
families
as
the
mortons
had
talked
of
into
ruts
of
and
so
on
he
saw
it
from
another
point
of
view
now
and
if
the
choice
were
between
rut
and
whirlpool
when
he
awoke
and
lay
looking
at
the
sunlit
blind
in
the
stillness
of
early
morning
he
heard
a
sound
always
delightful
always
soothing
that
of
scythe
and
whetstone
then
the
long
steady
sweep
of
the
blade
through
garden
grass
morton
old
would
not
let
his
gardener
use
a
mowing
machine
the
scythe
was
good
enough
for
him
and
harvey
recalled
to
the
summer
mornings
of
more
than
thirty
years
ago
blessed
him
for
his
but
another
sound
he
missed
one
he
would
have
heard
even
more
gladly
waking
thus
at
pinner
always
about
six
he
had
been
wont
to
hear
the
voice
of
his
little
boy
singing
possibly
this
was
a
doubtful
pleasure
to
miss
smith
in
whose
room
hughie
slept
but
to
her
credit
she
had
never
bidden
the
child
keep
quiet
and
there
he
lay
singing
to
himself
a
song
without
words
singing
like
a
little
bird
at
dawn
a
voice
of
innocent
happiness
greeting
the
new
day
hughie
was
far
off
and
in
a
strange
room
with
other
children
he
would
not
sing
but
harvey
heard
his
voice
the
odd
little
bursts
of
melody
the
liquid
rise
and
fall
which
set
to
tune
no
doubt
some
childish
fancy
some
fairy
tale
some
glad
anticipation
hughie
lived
in
the
golden
age
a
year
or
two
more
and
the
best
of
life
would
be
over
with
him
for
boyhood
is
but
a
leaden
time
compared
with
the
borderland
between
it
and
infancy
and
manhood
the
curse
of
sex
developed
it
was
a
merry
the
children
sprightly
talk
their
mother
excellent
spirits
and
morton
dry
jokes
with
one
and
all
made
harvey
feel
ashamed
of
the
rather
glum
habit
which
generally
kept
him
mute
at
the
first
meal
of
the
day
alma
too
was
seldom
in
the
mood
for
breakfast
conversation
so
that
between
them
they
imposed
silence
upon
hughie
and
miss
smith
one
might
have
thought
that
the
postman
had
brought
some
ill
news
depressing
the
household
yet
things
were
not
wont
to
be
so
bad
in
wales
at
that
time
the
day
as
a
rule
began
cheerfully
enough
their
life
had
darkened
in
the
shadow
of
london
just
when
for
the
child
sake
everything
should
have
been
made
as
bright
as
possible
and
he
saw
little
hope
of
change
for
the
better
it
did
not
depend
upon
him
the
note
of
family
life
is
struck
by
the
and
alma
seemed
fallen
so
far
from
her
better
self
that
he
could
only
look
forward
with
anxiety
to
new
developments
of
her
character
he
exclaimed
when
harry
with
satchel
over
shoulder
came
to
bid
him
good
morning
wish
i
could
go
in
your
place
it
just
years
since
i
left
the
old
the
boy
did
not
marvel
at
this
he
would
not
have
done
so
if
the
years
had
been
for
rolfe
seemed
to
him
an
old
man
very
much
older
than
his
own
father
as
usual
when
at
greystone
harvey
took
his
first
walk
to
the
spots
associated
with
his
childhood
he
walked
alone
for
morton
had
gone
to
business
until
midday
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
in
no
very
pleasant
situation
stood
the
house
where
he
was
born
new
buildings
had
risen
round
about
it
and
the
present
tenants
seemed
to
be
undesirable
people
who
neglected
the
garden
and
were
careless
about
their
window
curtains
here
he
had
lived
until
he
was
ten
years
old
till
the
death
of
his
father
his
mother
died
long
before
that
he
just
and
only
just
remembered
her
he
knew
from
others
that
she
was
a
gentle
thoughtful
woman
always
in
poor
health
the
birth
of
her
second
child
a
girl
led
to
a
lingering
illness
and
soon
came
the
end
to
her
place
as
mistress
of
the
house
succeeded
harvey
aunt
his
father
sister
no
one
could
have
been
kinder
to
the
children
but
harvey
for
some
reason
yet
obscure
to
him
always
disliked
her
whom
indeed
did
he
not
dislike
of
those
set
over
him
he
recalled
his
perpetual
rebellion
against
her
authority
from
the
first
day
to
the
last
what
an
unruly
cub
and
his
father
anger
when
he
chanced
to
overhear
some
boyish
insolence
alas
alas
for
he
saw
so
little
of
his
father
rolfe
work
as
a
railway
engineer
kept
him
chiefly
abroad
he
was
sometimes
absent
for
twelve
months
at
a
time
only
in
the
last
of
his
life
did
he
remain
constantly
at
home
and
that
because
he
was
dying
having
contracted
a
fever
in
spain
he
came
back
to
recruit
but
his
constitution
had
suffered
from
many
hardships
and
now
gave
way
to
the
last
day
though
he
was
ten
years
old
harvey
never
dreamt
of
what
was
about
to
happen
in
a
degree
unusual
even
with
boys
he
feared
his
father
but
had
not
learnt
to
love
him
and
now
looking
back
he
saw
only
too
well
why
the
anxious
parent
treated
him
with
severity
more
often
than
with
gentleness
and
good
humour
a
boy
such
as
he
must
have
given
sore
trouble
to
a
father
on
his
when
it
was
too
late
too
late
by
many
a
year
he
mourned
the
loss
which
had
only
startled
him
which
had
seemed
hardly
a
loss
at
all
rather
an
emancipation
as
a
man
of
thirty
he
knew
his
father
much
better
than
when
living
with
him
day
after
day
faults
he
could
perceive
some
of
them
inherited
in
his
own
character
but
there
remained
the
memory
of
a
man
whom
he
could
admire
and
love
whom
he
did
admire
and
love
more
sincerely
and
profoundly
the
older
he
grew
and
he
held
it
the
supreme
misfortune
of
his
life
that
in
those
early
years
which
count
so
much
towards
the
future
he
had
been
so
rarely
under
his
father
influence
inevitable
it
seemed
yet
only
so
perhaps
because
even
a
good
and
conscientious
man
may
fail
to
understand
the
obligation
under
which
he
lies
towards
his
offspring
he
and
his
sister
amy
passed
into
the
guardianship
of
dr
harvey
mr
rolfe
old
friend
the
boy
godfather
who
had
done
his
best
to
soothe
the
mind
of
the
dying
man
with
regard
to
his
children
future
there
were
no
pecuniary
difficulties
the
children
education
was
provided
for
and
on
coming
of
age
each
would
have
about
two
thousand
pounds
dr
harvey
a
irishman
with
no
youngsters
of
his
own
speedily
decided
that
the
boy
must
be
sent
away
to
a
to
have
some
of
the
knocked
out
of
him
amy
continued
to
live
with
her
aunt
for
two
years
more
then
the
good
woman
died
and
the
doctor
took
amy
into
his
own
house
which
became
harvey
home
during
holidays
the
house
in
the
best
residential
street
of
greystone
harvey
paused
before
it
on
the
railings
hung
a
brass
plate
with
another
name
the
good
old
doctor
had
been
in
his
grave
for
many
a
year
what
wonder
that
he
never
liked
the
boy
harvey
so
far
as
anyone
could
perceive
had
no
affection
no
good
feeling
no
youthful
freshness
or
simplicity
of
heart
moreover
he
exhibited
precocious
arrogance
supported
by
an
obstinacy
which
had
not
even
the
grace
of
quickening
into
fieriness
he
was
often
a
braggart
and
could
not
be
trusted
to
tell
the
truth
where
his
was
ever
so
little
concerned
how
unutterably
the
harvey
rolfe
of
today
despised
himself
at
the
age
of
fifteen
or
so
even
at
that
amorphous
age
a
more
loutish
ungainly
boy
could
scarcely
have
been
found
bashfulness
cost
him
horrid
torments
of
course
exasperating
his
conceit
he
hated
girls
he
scorned
women
among
his
he
made
a
bad
choice
of
comrades
though
muscular
and
of
tolerable
health
he
was
physically
as
well
as
morally
a
coward
games
and
sports
had
i
no
attraction
for
him
he
shut
himself
up
in
rooms
and
read
a
great
deal
yet
even
this
it
seemed
not
without
an
eye
to
winning
admiration
brains
he
had
brains
undeniably
but
for
a
long
time
there
was
the
greatest
doubt
as
to
what
use
he
could
make
of
them
harvey
remembered
the
day
when
it
was
settled
that
he
should
study
medicine
he
resolved
upon
it
merely
because
he
had
chanced
to
hear
the
doctor
say
that
he
was
not
cut
out
for
he
saw
himself
at
twenty
a
lank
ungainly
youth
with
a
disagreeable
complexion
and
a
struggling
moustache
he
was
a
student
at
guy
he
had
he
tasted
the
joy
of
independence
as
is
the
way
with
young
men
of
turbid
passions
and
indifferent
breeding
he
rapidly
signalised
his
independence
by
plunging
into
sordid
slavery
a
miserable
time
to
think
of
a
wilderness
of
riot
folly
and
shame
yet
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
enjoying
life
among
the
rowdy
set
of
his
he
shone
with
a
certain
superiority
his
contempt
of
money
and
his
large
way
of
talking
about
it
conveyed
the
impression
that
abundant
means
awaited
him
he
gave
away
coin
as
readily
as
he
spent
it
on
himself
not
so
much
in
a
true
spirit
of
generosity
though
his
character
had
gleams
of
it
as
because
he
dreaded
above
all
things
the
appearance
of
niggardliness
and
the
suspicion
of
a
shallow
purse
then
came
the
memorable
interview
with
his
guardian
on
his
birthday
harvey
flinched
and
grew
hot
in
thinking
of
it
what
an
ungrateful
cur
what
a
young
idiot
the
doctor
had
borne
so
kindly
with
his
follies
and
vices
had
taken
so
much
trouble
for
his
good
was
it
not
the
man
right
and
duty
to
speak
grave
words
of
counsel
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
but
to
counsel
harvey
rolfe
was
to
be
guilty
of
gross
impertinence
with
lofty
spirit
the
young
gentleman
proclaimed
that
he
must
no
longer
be
treated
as
a
whereupon
the
doctor
lost
his
temper
and
spoke
with
a
particularly
strong
hibernian
accent
spoke
words
which
to
this
moment
stung
the
hearer
memory
he
saw
himself
marching
from
the
room
that
room
yonder
on
the
it
was
some
small
consolation
to
remember
that
he
had
been
drinking
steadily
for
a
week
before
that
happened
indeed
he
could
recall
no
scene
quite
so
discreditable
throughout
the
course
of
his
insensate
youth
well
he
had
something
like
two
thousand
pounds
whether
he
had
looked
for
more
or
less
he
hardly
knew
or
whether
he
had
looked
for
anything
at
all
at
he
was
the
merest
child
in
matters
of
the
world
surely
something
must
have
arrested
the
natural
development
of
his
even
in
another
ten
years
he
was
scarcely
on
a
level
as
regards
practical
intelligence
with
the
ordinary
lad
who
is
leaving
school
he
at
once
threw
up
his
medical
studies
which
had
grown
hateful
to
him
he
took
his
first
taste
of
foreign
travel
he
extended
his
reading
and
his
knowledge
of
languages
and
insensibly
a
couple
of
years
went
by
the
possession
of
money
had
done
him
good
it
clarified
his
passions
or
tended
that
way
a
which
differed
appreciably
from
what
he
had
formerly
understood
by
that
term
began
to
guard
him
against
grossness
together
with
it
there
developed
in
him
a
new
social
pride
which
made
him
desire
the
acquaintance
of
people
though
he
had
no
longer
any
communication
with
the
good
old
doctor
amy
frequently
wrote
to
him
and
in
one
of
her
letters
she
begged
him
to
call
on
a
family
in
london
one
of
whose
younger
members
lived
at
greystone
and
was
amy
friend
after
much
delay
he
overcame
his
bashfulness
and
called
upon
the
worthy
people
tailored
as
became
a
gentleman
at
large
the
acquaintance
led
to
others
in
a
short
time
he
was
on
pleasant
terms
with
several
families
he
might
have
suspected
but
at
the
time
of
course
did
not
that
dr
harvey
kindly
influence
had
something
to
do
with
his
reception
in
these
houses
but
painfully
he
struggled
to
overcome
his
natural
defects
of
manner
possibly
with
some
success
for
did
not
lily
burton
who
at
first
so
piqued
him
by
her
critical
smile
come
to
show
him
tolerance
friendliness
gracious
interest
lily
burton
how
emptily
how
foolishly
the
name
tinkled
out
of
that
empty
and
foolish
past
yet
what
a
power
it
had
over
him
when
he
was
three
and
twenty
of
all
the
savage
epithets
which
he
afterwards
attached
to
its
owner
probably
she
merited
a
few
she
was
a
flirt
at
all
events
she
drew
him
on
played
upon
his
emotions
found
him
no
doubt
excellent
fun
and
at
last
when
he
was
imbecile
enough
to
declare
himself
to
talk
of
marriage
lily
raising
the
drollest
eyes
quietly
wished
to
know
what
his
prospects
were
the
intolerable
shame
of
it
even
now
but
he
laughed
mocking
at
his
dead
self
his
mind
eye
beheld
the
strange
being
a
year
later
still
in
good
clothes
but
unhealthy
and
at
his
last
four
and
twenty
travelled
and
possessed
of
the
elements
of
culture
he
had
only
just
begun
to
realise
the
fact
that
men
labour
for
their
daily
bread
was
it
the
peculiar
intensity
of
his
egoism
that
so
long
blinded
him
to
common
anxieties
even
as
the
last
coins
slipped
between
his
fingers
he
knew
only
a
vaguely
irritable
apprehension
did
he
imagine
the
world
would
beg
for
the
honour
of
feeding
and
clothing
harvey
rolfe
it
came
back
to
him
his
first
experience
of
hunger
so
very
different
a
thing
from
appetite
he
saw
the
miserable
bedroom
where
he
sat
on
a
rainy
day
he
smelt
the
pawnshop
his
heart
sank
again
under
the
weight
of
awful
solitude
then
his
illness
the
letter
he
wrote
to
amy
her
visit
to
him
the
help
she
brought
but
she
could
not
persuade
him
to
go
back
with
her
to
greystone
to
face
the
doctor
her
money
was
a
loan
he
would
bestir
himself
and
find
occupation
for
a
wonder
it
was
found
the
place
at
the
emigration
agency
and
so
for
a
good
many
years
the
notable
harvey
rolfe
sank
into
a
life
of
obscure
routine
again
and
again
his
sister
amy
besought
him
to
visit
greystone
dr
harvey
was
breaking
up
would
he
not
see
the
kind
old
man
once
more
yes
he
assured
himself
that
he
would
but
he
took
his
time
about
it
and
dr
harvey
who
at
threescore
and
ten
could
not
be
expected
to
wait
upon
a
young
man
convenience
one
day
very
quietly
died
to
amy
rolfe
who
had
become
as
a
daughter
to
him
he
left
the
larger
part
of
his
possessions
an
income
of
nine
hundred
a
year
not
long
after
this
harvey
met
his
sister
and
was
astonished
to
find
her
looking
thin
pale
spiritless
what
did
it
mean
why
did
she
gaze
at
him
so
sadly
come
come
he
cried
she
had
been
leading
an
unnatural
life
cloistered
cheerless
now
that
she
was
independent
she
must
enjoy
herself
see
the
world
brave
words
and
braver
still
those
in
which
he
replied
to
amy
entreaty
that
he
would
share
her
wealth
not
he
indeed
if
as
she
said
the
doctor
meant
and
hoped
it
why
did
he
not
make
that
plain
in
his
will
not
a
penny
would
he
take
he
had
all
he
wanted
and
he
seemed
to
himself
the
most
magnanimous
of
men
amy
lived
on
at
greystone
amid
friends
to
be
sure
but
silent
melancholy
and
he
the
brother
whom
she
loved
could
spare
her
only
a
day
or
two
once
a
year
when
he
chattered
his
idle
anyone
else
would
have
taken
trouble
to
inquire
the
cause
of
her
pallor
her
sadness
he
forsooth
had
to
learn
with
astonishment
at
last
that
she
wished
to
see
him
on
her
deathbed
he
had
often
thought
of
her
and
kindly
but
he
knew
her
not
at
all
took
no
interest
in
her
existence
she
on
the
other
hand
had
treasured
every
miserable
little
letter
his
idleness
vouchsafed
she
had
hoped
so
for
his
future
ever
believing
in
him
when
amy
lay
dead
he
saw
the
sheet
of
paper
on
which
she
had
written
the
few
lines
necessary
to
endow
him
with
all
she
left
everything
my
dear
brother
what
words
could
have
reproached
him
so
keenly
his
steps
turned
to
the
churchyard
where
on
a
plain
upright
stone
he
read
the
names
of
his
mother
of
his
father
amy
grave
was
hard
by
he
too
if
he
had
his
wish
would
some
day
rest
here
and
here
his
own
son
would
stand
and
read
his
name
and
think
of
him
ah
but
with
no
such
remorse
and
that
was
inconceivable
the
tenderness
which
dimmed
his
eyes
would
have
changed
to
misery
had
he
dreamed
it
possible
that
his
own
boy
could
palter
so
ignobly
with
the
opportunities
of
life
upon
these
deep
emotions
intruded
the
thought
of
alma
intruded
for
he
neither
sought
nor
welcomed
his
wife
companionship
at
such
a
moment
and
he
was
disturbed
by
a
perception
of
the
little
claim
she
had
to
be
present
with
him
in
spirit
he
could
no
longer
pretend
to
himself
that
he
loved
alma
whatever
the
right
name
for
his
complex
of
feelings
interest
regard
admiration
sexual
attachment
assuredly
it
must
be
another
word
than
that
sacred
to
the
memory
of
his
parents
to
the
desires
and
hopes
centring
in
his
child
for
all
that
he
had
no
sense
of
a
hopeless
discord
in
his
wedded
life
he
suffered
from
no
disillusion
with
its
attendant
bitterness
from
this
he
was
saved
by
the
fact
easy
at
length
to
recognise
that
in
wooing
alma
he
had
obeyed
no
dictate
of
the
nobler
passion
here
too
as
at
every
other
crisis
of
life
he
had
acted
on
motives
which
would
not
bear
analysis
so
large
was
the
alloy
of
mere
temperament
of
weak
concession
to
circumstance
rather
than
complain
that
alma
fell
short
of
the
ideal
in
wifehood
should
he
not
marvel
and
be
grateful
that
their
marriage
might
still
be
called
a
happy
one
happiness
in
marriage
is
a
term
of
such
vague
application
basil
morton
one
in
ten
thousand
might
call
himself
happy
even
so
all
things
considered
must
the
husband
who
finds
it
possible
to
endure
the
contiguity
of
his
wife
midway
between
these
extremes
of
the
definition
stood
harvey
measure
of
matrimonial
bliss
he
saw
that
he
had
no
right
to
grumble
he
saw
moreover
and
reflected
constantly
upon
it
in
these
days
how
largely
he
was
himself
to
blame
for
the
peril
of
estrangement
which
threatened
his
life
with
alma
meaning
well
and
thinking
himself
a
pattern
of
marital
wisdom
he
had
behaved
as
usual
with
gross
lack
of
discretion
the
question
now
was
could
he
mend
the
harm
that
he
had
done
love
did
not
enter
into
the
matter
his
difficulty
called
for
for
rational
methods
in
behaviour
towards
a
wife
whom
he
could
still
respect
and
who
was
closely
bound
to
him
by
common
interest
in
their
child
he
looked
up
and
had
pleasure
once
more
in
the
sunny
sky
after
all
he
even
he
had
not
committed
the
most
woeful
of
all
blunders
though
it
was
a
mystery
how
he
had
escaped
it
the
crown
of
his
feeble
futile
career
should
in
all
fitness
have
been
marriage
with
a
woman
worse
than
himself
and
not
on
his
own
account
did
he
thank
protecting
fortune
one
lesson
if
one
only
he
had
truly
learnt
from
nature
it
bade
him
forget
all
personal
disquietude
in
joy
that
he
was
not
guilty
of
that
crime
of
crimes
the
begetting
of
children
by
a
worthless
mother
chapter
morton
felt
a
lively
interest
in
rolfe
musical
enterprise
and
would
have
liked
to
talk
about
it
but
she
suspected
that
the
topic
was
not
very
agreeable
to
her
guest
in
writing
to
morton
harvey
had
just
mentioned
the
matter
and
that
was
all
on
the
second
day
of
his
visit
when
he
felt
much
better
and
saw
things
in
a
less
troubled
light
he
wished
to
remove
the
impression
that
he
regarded
proceedings
with
sullen
disapproval
so
he
took
the
opportunity
of
being
alone
with
his
hostess
and
talked
to
her
of
the
great
venture
with
all
the
good
humour
he
could
command
morton
had
seen
two
notices
of
alma
debut
both
were
so
favourable
that
she
imagined
them
the
augury
of
a
brilliant
career
doubt
that
said
harvey
i
not
sure
that
it
desirable
she
has
made
herself
miserably
ill
you
see
excitement
is
the
worst
possible
thing
for
her
and
then
there
the
whole
question
of
whether
professional
life
is
right
and
good
for
a
married
woman
how
do
you
think
about
it
the
lady
instanced
cases
that
naturally
presented
themselves
she
seemed
to
have
no
prejudice
rolfe
appeared
to
her
a
person
of
artistic
temper
but
health
was
of
the
first
importance
and
then
harvey
waited
but
only
a
thoughtful
smile
completed
the
remark
other
consideration
had
you
in
mind
a
commonplace
that
a
married
woman
would
of
course
be
guided
by
her
husband
wish
think
that
equivalent
to
reason
and
the
will
of
god
said
harvey
jocosely
we
need
appeal
to
solemn
sanction
rolfe
was
reminded
not
unpleasantly
that
he
spoke
with
a
woman
to
whom
will
of
god
was
something
more
than
a
facetious
phrase
beg
your
pardon
let
us
say
reason
alone
but
is
it
reasonable
for
the
artist
to
sacrifice
herself
because
she
happens
to
have
married
an
everyday
man
morton
shook
her
head
and
laughed
only
one
know
what
is
meant
by
the
everyday
man
my
private
view
of
him
is
rather
flattering
perhaps
i
inclined
to
think
him
on
the
whole
not
inferior
to
the
everyday
woman
and
she
is
a
bad
sort
of
creature
if
fairly
treated
i
do
think
the
everyday
man
will
go
very
far
wrong
as
a
rule
in
the
treatment
of
his
wife
really
believe
that
asked
harvey
with
a
serious
smile
is
it
such
a
heresy
should
rather
have
thought
so
one
is
so
accustomed
to
hear
the
other
view
i
mean
it
in
the
air
do
think
i
asking
your
sympathy
i
have
always
wished
alma
to
act
on
her
own
judgment
she
has
been
left
quite
free
to
do
so
but
if
the
results
seem
worse
than
doubtful
then
comes
the
difficulty
be
settled
surely
like
all
other
difficulties
between
sensible
people
morton
faith
was
of
enviable
simplicity
she
knew
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
husbands
and
wives
often
found
their
difficulties
insuperable
but
why
this
should
be
so
seemed
to
her
one
of
the
dark
and
mournful
enigmas
of
life
it
implied
such
a
lack
not
only
of
good
sense
but
of
right
feeling
in
her
own
experience
she
had
met
with
no
doubt
no
worry
which
did
not
yield
to
tact
or
generous
endeavour
or
at
worst
to
the
creed
by
which
she
lived
one
solicitude
and
one
only
continued
to
affect
her
as
wife
and
mother
that
it
could
not
overcome
her
happy
temper
was
due
to
the
hope
perpetually
inspired
by
her
husband
love
a
hope
inseparable
from
her
profoundest
convictions
she
and
morton
differed
in
religious
views
and
there
had
come
a
grave
moment
when
she
asked
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
educate
her
children
in
her
own
belief
without
putting
a
distance
between
them
and
their
father
the
doubt
had
disappeared
thanks
to
morton
breadth
of
view
or
facility
of
conscience
there
remained
the
trouble
in
which
it
had
originated
but
she
solaced
herself
with
the
fond
assurance
that
this
also
would
vanish
as
time
went
on
in
the
same
mood
of
kindly
serenity
she
regarded
the
lives
of
her
friends
always
hoping
for
the
best
and
finding
it
hard
to
understand
that
anyone
could
deliberately
act
with
unkindness
unreasonableness
or
any
other
quality
opposed
to
the
common
good
rolfe
had
no
desire
of
talking
further
about
his
private
affairs
he
had
made
up
his
mind
on
the
points
at
issue
and
needed
no
counsel
but
the
spirit
of
morton
conversation
helped
him
to
think
tranquilly
the
great
danger
was
that
he
might
make
things
worse
by
his
way
of
regarding
them
most
unluckily
alma
illness
had
become
connected
in
his
imagination
with
the
tragedy
of
the
carnabys
he
could
not
keep
the
things
apart
hugh
carnaby
miserable
doom
and
the
dark
surmises
attaching
to
his
wife
doubtless
had
their
part
in
bringing
about
a
nervous
crisis
why
could
he
not
recognise
this
as
perfectly
natural
and
dismiss
the
matter
in
spite
of
all
reasoning
image
ever
and
again
appeared
to
him
shadowed
by
the
gloom
which
involved
her
friend
or
the
woman
who
her
friend
he
knew
it
or
believed
it
to
be
the
merest
illusion
of
his
perturbed
mind
for
no
fact
how
trivial
soever
had
suggested
to
him
that
alma
knew
more
of
the
circumstances
of
redgrave
death
than
she
seemed
to
know
on
the
one
hand
he
was
glad
that
alma
and
sibyl
no
longer
cared
to
meet
on
the
other
he
could
not
understand
what
had
caused
this
cessation
of
their
friendship
and
he
puzzled
over
it
but
these
idle
fancies
would
pass
away
they
were
already
less
troublesome
a
long
country
walk
with
morton
during
which
they
conversed
only
of
things
intellectual
did
him
much
good
not
long
ago
morton
had
had
a
visit
from
an
old
cambridge
friend
a
man
who
had
devoted
himself
to
the
study
of
a
certain
short
period
of
english
history
and
hoped
some
ten
years
hence
to
produce
an
authoritative
work
on
the
subject
a
man
i
envy
cried
rolfe
when
he
had
listened
to
humorous
description
of
the
enthusiast
exactly
what
i
should
like
to
do
myself
prevents
you
irresolution
the
feeling
that
the
best
of
my
life
is
over
i
have
never
been
seriously
a
student
and
it
too
late
to
begin
now
but
if
i
were
ten
years
younger
i
would
make
myself
master
of
something
what
the
use
of
reading
only
to
forget
in
my
time
i
have
gone
through
no
small
library
of
historical
books
and
it
all
a
mist
on
the
mind
horizon
that
comes
of
reading
without
method
without
a
purpose
the
time
i
have
given
to
it
would
have
made
me
a
pundit
if
i
had
gone
to
work
reasonably
my
case
the
same
exclaimed
morton
do
i
care
i
enjoyed
my
reading
and
my
knowledge
at
the
time
and
that
all
i
ever
expected
well
though
you
misrepresent
yourself
but
for
me
it
enough
i
want
to
know
something
as
well
as
it
can
be
known
purely
for
my
own
satisfaction
the
thought
of
doing
something
does
come
in
at
all
i
was
looking
at
your
county
histories
this
morning
and
i
felt
a
huge
longing
to
give
the
rest
of
my
life
to
some
little
bit
of
england
a
county
or
even
a
town
and
exhaust
the
possibilities
of
knowledge
within
those
limits
why
greystone
here
it
has
an
interesting
history
even
in
relation
to
england
at
large
and
what
a
delight
there
would
be
in
following
it
out
doggedly
invincibly
making
it
one
single
subject
grubbing
after
it
in
and
libraries
learning
by
heart
every
stone
of
the
old
town
dying
at
last
with
the
consolation
that
nobody
could
teach
one
anything
more
about
it
know
the
mood
said
morton
laughing
narrowing
down
pursued
harvey
i
had
tremendous
visions
dreamt
of
holding
half
a
dozen
civilisations
in
the
hollow
of
my
hand
i
came
back
from
the
east
in
a
fury
to
learn
the
oriental
languages
made
a
start
you
know
with
arabic
i
dropped
one
nation
after
another

drawing
nearer

to
suffice

the
end

be

why
not
devote
one
self
to
the
history
of
a
it
would
be
respectable
i
tell
you
thoroughness
is
all
when
they
were
alone
in
the
library
at
night
morton
spoke
of
his

boy

knows
what
the
use
of
letting
her
grow
up
with
ideas
of
gentility

in

would
mean
nothing
but
uselessness
she
must
support
herself

later

it

be

of
potatoes
morton
admitted
the
force
of
these
arguments
would
you
wish
your
own
boy
to
be
he
asked
presently
unadventurous
happily
obscure
a
country
parson
perhaps
best
of
all
understand
i
had
the
same
thoughts
but
one
ii
to
get
over
that
kind
of
thing
it
wo
do
to
be
afraid
of
life
nor
of
death
either
there
the
difficulty
of
education
said
rolfe
i
followed
my
instincts
i
should
make
the
boy
unfit
for
anything
but
the
quietest
obscurest
life
i
should
make
him
hate
a
street
and
love
the
fields
i
should
teach
him
to
despise
every
form
of
ambition
to
shrink
from
every
kind
of
pleasure
but
the
simplest
and
purest
to
think
of
life
as
a
long
day
ramble
and
death
as
the
quiet
sleep
that
comes
at
the
end
of
it
i
should
like
him
not
to
marry
never
to
feel
the
need
of
it
or
if
marry
he
must
to
have
no
children
that
my
real
wish
and
if
i
tried
to
carry
it
out
the
chances
are
that
i
should
do
him
an
intolerable
wrong
for
fear
of
it
i
must
give
him
into
the
hands
of
other
people
i
must
see
him
grow
into
habits
and
thoughts
which
will
cause
me
perpetual
uneasiness
i
must
watch
him
drift
further
and
further
away
from
my
own
ideal
of
life
till
at
length
perhaps
there
is
scarce
a
possibility
of
sympathy
between
us
all
morbid
remarked
the
listener
do
know
it
may
only
mean
that
one
sees
too
clearly
the
root
facts
of
existence
i
have
another
mood
less
frequent
in
which
i
try
to
persuade
myself
that
i
do
care
much
about
the
child
that
his
future
does
really
concern
me
at
all
why
should
it
he
just
one
of
the
millions
of
human
beings
who
come
and
go
a
hundred
years
hence
what
of
him
and
of
me
what
can
it
matter
how
he
lived
and
how
he
died
the
best
kind
of
education
would
be
that
which
hardened
his
skin
and
blunted
his
sympathies
what
right
have
i
to
make
him
sensitive
the
thing
is
to
get
through
life
with
as
little
suffering
as
possible
what
monstrous
folly
to
teach
him
to
wince
and
cry
out
at
the
sufferings
of
other
people
wo
he
have
enough
of
his
own
before
he
has
done
yet
that
what
we
shall
aim
at
to
cultivate
his
sympathetic
emotions
so
that
the
death
of
a
bird
shall
make
him
sad
and
the
sight
of
human
distress
wring
his
heart
real
kindness
would
try
to
make
of
him
a
healthy
ruffian
with
just
enough
conscience
to
keep
him
from
crime
for
theory
i
prefer
this
said
morton
a
certain
extent
i
try
to
act
upon
it
do
because
i
know
that
my
own
tendency
is
to
i
have
sometimes
surprised
my
wife
by
bidding
harry
disregard
things
that
appealed
to
his
pity
you
remember
what
old
hobbes
says
malus
puer
there
was
more
truth
in
it
in
his
day
than
in
ours
it
natural
for
a
boy
to
be
a
good
deal
of
a
savage
but
our
civilisation
is
doing
its
best
to
change
that
why
not
long
ago
the
lad
asked
me
whether
fishing
was
cruel
he
evidently
felt
that
it
was
and
so
do
i
but
i
could
say
so
i
laughed
it
off
and
told
him
that
a
fish
diet
was
excellent
for
the
brains
hope
i
may
have
as
much
courage
said
harvey
is
a
compromise
my
dear
fellow
if
the
world
at
large
would
suddenly
come
round
to
a
cultivation
of
the
amiable
virtues
well
and
good
but
there
no
hope
of
it
as
it
is
our
little
crabs
must
grow
their
hard
shell
or
they
no
chance
about
progress
in
educating
children
we
are
making
the
new
world
morton
assented
there
no
hurry
the
growth
must
be
gradual
will
be
whether
we
intend
it
or
not
the
fact
is
i
try
not
to
think
overmuch
about
my
children
it
remains
a
doubt
you
know
whether
education
has
any
influence
worth
speaking
of
me
said
harvey
doubt
seems
absurd
in
my
own
case
i
know
a
good
system
of
training
would
have
made
an
enormous
difference
practically
i
was
left
to
train
myself
and
a
nice
job
i
made
of
it
do
you
remember
how
i
used
to
talk
about
children
before
i
had
one
i
have
thought
it
was
the
talk
of
a
fool
but
perhaps
after
all
it
had
more
sanity
than
my
views
nowadays
murmured
basil
what
about
your
girls
asked
the
other
when
they
had
smoked
in
silence
the
difficulty
greater
or
less
my
point
of
view
less
for
one
thing
i
can
leave
them
entirely
in
the
hands
of
their
mother
if
they
resemble
her
they
wo
do
amiss
and
there
no
bother
about
work
in
life
they
will
have
enough
to
live
upon
just
enough
of
course
they
may
want
to
go
out
into
the
world
i
shall
neither
hinder
nor
encourage
i
had
rather
they
stayed
at
home
lose
sight
of
the
possibility
that
by
when
they
are
grown
up
there
may
be
no
such
thing
as
home
the
word
is
dying
out
morton
pedantry
led
him
again
to
murmur
latin
renascentur
quoe
jam
the
happiest
man
i
know
or
ever
shall
know
said
rolfe
with
more
feeling
than
he
cared
to
exhibit
make
me
think
about
croesus
king
of
lydia
on
the
whole
happiness
means
health
and
health
comes
of
occupation
in
one
point
i
agree
with
you
about
yourself
it
would
have
been
better
if
someone
had
found
the
right
kind
of
work
for
you
and
made
you
stick
to
it
how
does
your
friend
the
photographic
man
get
on
at
all
badly
did
i
tell
you
i
had
put
money
into
it
i
go
there
a
good
deal
and
pretend
to
do
something
pretend
could
you
find
a
regular
job
there
for
a
few
hours
every
day
dare
say
i
could
it
be
easier
to
get
backwards
and
forwards
from
gunnersbury
how
would
you
like
he
added
with
a
laugh
live
at
gunnersbury
does
it
matter
where
one
lives
i
have
something
of
a
prejudice
against
hoxton
or
bermondsey
but
i
think
i
could
get
along
in
most
other
places
gunnersbury
is
rather
pleasant
i
thought
is
it
quite
near
to
kew
and
richmond
those
names
attract
you
have
a
certain
charm
for
the
rustic
ear
all
one
to
me
hughie
will
go
to
school
and
make
friends
with
other
children
you
see
he
had
no
chance
of
it
yet
we
know
a
hundred
people
or
so
but
have
no
intimates
is
there
such
a
thing
as
intimacy
of
families
in
london
i
inclined
to
think
not
here
you
go
into
each
other
houses
without
fuss
and
sham
you
know
each
other
and
trust
each
other
in
london
there
no
such
comfort
at
all
events
for
educated
people
if
you
have
a
friend
he
lives
miles
away
before
his
children
and
yours
can
meet
they
must
travel
for
an
hour
and
a
half
by
bus
and
underground
suppose
it
be
london
interrupted
morton
afraid
so
harvey
replied
absently
and
his
friend
said
no
more
he
had
meant
this
visit
to
be
of
three
days
at
most
but
time
slipped
by
so
pleasantly
that
a
week
was
gone
before
he
could
resolve
on
departure
most
of
the
mornings
he
spent
in
rambles
alone
rediscovering
many
a
spot
in
the
country
round
which
had
been
familiar
to
him
as
a
boy
but
which
he
had
never
cared
to
seek
in
his
revisitings
of
greystone
hitherto
one
day
as
he
followed
the
windings
of
a
sluggish
stream
he
saw
flowers
of
arrowhead
white
flowers
with
crimson
centre
floating
by
the
bank
and
remembered
that
he
had
once
plucked
them
here
when
on
a
walk
with
his
father
who
held
him
the
while
lest
he
should
stretch
too
far
and
fall
in
to
reach
them
now
he
lay
down
upon
the
grassy
brink
and
in
that
moment
there
returned
to
him
with
exquisite
vividness
the
mind
the
senses
of
childhood
once
more
he
knew
the
child
pleasure
in
contact
with
earth
and
his
hand
grasped
hard
at
the
turf
as
though
to
keep
hold
upon
the
past
thus
fleetingly
recovered
it
was
gone
no
doubt
for
ever
a
last
glimpse
vouchsafed
to
him
of
life
beginning
as
he
set
his
face
towards
the
end
then
came
a
thought
of
joy
the
keen
sensations
which
he
himself
had
lost
were
his
child
inheritance
somewhere
in
the
fields
this
summer
morning
hughie
was
delighting
in
the
scent
the
touch
of
earth
young
amid
a
world
where
all
was
new
the
stereotyped
phrase
about
parents
living
again
in
their
children
became
a
reality
and
a
source
of
deep
content
so
does
a
man
repeat
the
experience
of
the
race
and
with
each
step
onward
live
into
the
meaning
of
some
old
word
that
he
has
but
idly
echoed
on
the
day
before
he
left
a
letter
reached
him
from
alma
he
had
felt
surprise
at
not
hearing
sooner
from
her
but
alma
words
explained
the
delay
have
been
thinking
a
great
deal
she
wrote
i
want
to
tell
you
of
my
thoughts
do
imagine
they
are
mere
fancies
the
result
of
i
feel
all
but
well
again
and
have
a
perfectly
clear
head
and
perhaps
it
is
better
that
i
should
write
what
i
have
to
say
instead
of
speaking
it
in
this
way
i
oblige
you
to
hear
me
out
i
do
mean
that
you
are
in
the
habit
of
interrupting
me
but
perhaps
you
would
if
i
began
to
talk
as
i
am
going
to
write
ca
we
stay
at
pinner
that
shall
have
a
line
to
itself
take
breath
and
now
listen
again
i
dislike
the
thought
of
removing
to
gunnersbury
really
and
seriously
i
dislike
it
you
know
i
have
given
you
this
kind
of
trouble
before
when
we
left
wales
i
was
quite
willing
to
have
stayed
on
if
you
had
wished
it
was
i
forgive
me
then
for
springing
this
upon
you
after
all
your
arrangements
are
made
i
could
not
do
it
if
i
did
not
feel
that
our
happiness
not
mine
only
is
concerned
would
it
be
possible
to
cancel
your
agreement
with
the
gunnersbury
man
if
not
could
you
sublet
with
little
or
no
loss
the
pinner
house
is
let
yet
is
it
do
let
us
stay
where
we
are
i
think
it
is
the
first
serious
request
i
ever
made
of
you
and
i
think
you
will
see
that
i
have
some
right
to
make
it
had
rather
much
rather
that
hughie
did
not
go
to
school
do
get
angry
and
call
me
foolish
what
i
mean
is
that
i
would
rather
teach
him
myself
in
your
opinion
i
have
neglected
him
and
i
confess
that
you
are
right
there
now
i
shall
give
up
my
music
at
all
events
i
shall
not
play
again
in
public
i
have
shown
what
i
could
do
and
that
enough
you
do
like
it
though
you
have
never
tried
to
show
me
and
again
i
feel
that
you
are
right
a
professional
life
for
me
would
mean
i
see
it
now
the
loss
of
things
more
precious
i
will
give
it
up
and
live
quietly
at
home
i
will
have
regular
hours
for
teaching
hughie
if
you
prefer
it
pauline
shall
go
and
i
will
take
charge
of
him
altogether
if
i
do
this
what
need
for
us
to
remove
the
house
is
more
comfortable
than
the
new
one
at
gunnersbury
we
are
accustomed
to
it
and
by
being
farther
from
london
i
shall
have
less
temptation
to
gad
about
i
know
exactly
what
i
am
promising
and
i
feel
i
do
it
now
that
my
mind
is
made
up
i
fear
a
refusal
i
ca
think
so
give
the
matter
your
best
thought
and
see
whether
there
are
not
several
reasons
on
my
side
but
please
answer
as
soon
as
you
can
for
i
shall
be
in
suspense
till
i
hear
from
you
alma
signed
herself
ever
affectionately
but
harvey
could
find
no
trace
of
affection
in
the
letter
it
astonished
and
annoyed
him
of
course
it
could
have
but
one
explanation
alma
might
as
well
have
saved
herself
trouble
by
writing
in
a
line
or
two
that
she
disliked
abbott
and
could
not
bear
that
the
child
should
be
taught
by
her
he
read
through
the
pages
again
and
grew
angry
what
right
had
she
to
make
such
a
request
as
this
and
in
the
tone
of
a
demand
twice
in
the
letter
she
asserted
that
she
a
right
asserted
it
as
if
with
some
mysterious
reference
had
he
sat
down
immediately
to
reply
harvey
would
have
written
briefly
forcibly
for
putting
aside
other
grounds
of
irritation
there
is
nothing
a
man
dislikes
more
than
being
called
upon
at
last
moment
to
upset
elaborate
and
troublesome
arrangements
but
he
was
obliged
to
postpone
his
answer
for
a
few
hours
and
in
the
meantime
he
grew
more
tolerant
of
alma
feelings
had
her
objection
come
earlier
accompanied
by
the
same
proposals
he
would
have
been
inclined
to
listen
but
things
had
gone
too
far
he
wrote
quite
but
without
shadow
of
wavering
there
was
nothing
sudden
he
pointed
out
in
the
step
he
was
about
to
take
alma
had
known
it
for
months
and
had
acquiesced
in
it
as
for
her
music
he
quite
agreed
with
her
that
she
would
find
it
better
in
every
way
to
abandon
thoughts
of
a
public
career
and
the
fact
of
hughie
going
to
school
for
two
or
three
hours
a
day
would
in
no
wise
interfere
with
her
wish
to
see
more
of
him
what
her
precise
meaning
was
in
saying
that
she
had
some
to
make
this
request
he
declared
himself
unable
to
discover
was
it
a
reproach
if
so
his
conscience
afforded
him
no
light
and
he
hoped
alma
would
explain
the
words
in
a
letter
to
him
at
pinner
this
correspondence
clouded
his
last
evening
at
greystone
he
was
glad
that
some
acquaintances
of
morton
came
and
stayed
late
sitting
alone
with
his
friend
he
would
have
been
tempted
to
talk
of
alma
and
he
felt
that
silence
was
better
just
now
by
a
train
soon
after
breakfast
next
morning
he
left
the
old
town
dearer
to
him
each
time
that
he
beheld
it
and
travelled
slowly
to
the
junction
whence
again
he
travelled
slowly
to
peterborough
there
the
express
caught
him
up
and
flung
him
into
roaring
london
again
before
going
to
pinner
he
wished
to
see
cecil
morphew
for
he
had
an
idea
to
communicate
a
suggestion
for
the
extending
of
business
by
opening
correspondence
with
out
of
the
way
towns
such
as
greystone
on
reaching
the
shop
in
westminster
bridge
road
he
found
that
morphew
also
had
a
communication
to
make
and
of
a
more
exciting
nature
chapter
morphew
was
engaged
upstairs
with
the
secretary
of
an
amateur
photographic
society
waiting
for
this
person
departure
rolfe
talked
with
the
shopman
a
capable
fellow
aged
about
thirty
whose
heart
was
in
the
business
he
looked
at
a
new
which
seemed
likely
to
have
a
good
sale
and
heard
encouraging
reports
of
things
in
general
then
morphew
came
down
escorting
his
visitor
as
soon
as
he
was
free
he
grasped
harvey
by
the
arm
and
whispered
eagerly
that
he
had
something
to
tell
him
they
went
upstairs
together
into
a
room
furnished
as
an
office
hung
about
with
many
framed
photographs
dead
exclaimed
cecil
dead
a
name
was
needless
only
one
man
death
could
be
the
cause
of
such
excitement
in
morphew
and
it
had
been
so
long
awaited
that
the
event
had
no
touch
of
solemnity
yet
harvey
perceived
that
his
exultation
was
not
unmixed
with
disquietude
morning
early
i
heard
it
by
chance
of
course
she
written
to
me
but
no
doubt
i
shall
hear
in
a
few
days
i
walked
about
near
the
house
for
hours
last
night
like
an
idiot
the
thing
seemed
impossible
i
had
to
keep
reminding
myself
by
looking
at
the
windows
that
it
was
true
eight
years
think
of
that
eight
years
misery
due
to
that
fellow
snobbishness
in
harvey
mind
the
story
had
a
somewhat
different
aspect
he
knew
nothing
personally
of
this
winter
who
might
indeed
be
an
incarnation
of
snobbery
on
the
other
hand
cecil
morphew
had
his
defects
and
even
to
a
parent
might
not
recommend
himself
as
a
then
again
the
young
lady
herself
now
about
six
and
twenty
must
surely
have
been
influenced
by
some
other
motive
than
respect
for
her
parents
wishes
in
thus
protracting
her
engagement
with
a
lover
who
had
a
secure
though
modest
income
was
it
not
conceivable
that
she
inherited
something
of
the
paternal
spirit
or
at
all
events
that
her
feelings
had
not
quite
the
warmth
that
morphew
imagined
glad
it
over
he
replied
cordially
begins
a
new
life
for
you
eight
years
eight
years
of
waiting
it
what
is
your
age
thirty
why
you
only
just
old
enough
no
man
ought
to
marry
before
thirty
morphew
interrupted
vehemently
all
rot
excuse
me
i
ca
help
it
a
man
ought
to
marry
when
he
urged
to
it
by
his
nature
and
as
soon
as
he
finds
the
right
woman
if
i
had
married
eight
years
ago
he
broke
off
with
an
angry
gesture
misery
in
his
eyes
do
believe
that
humbug
rolfe
you
repeat
it
just
to
console
me
there
little
consolation
i
can
assure
you
i
was
two
and
twenty
she
nineteen
mature
man
and
woman
and
we
longed
for
each
other
nothing
but
harm
could
come
of
waiting
year
after
year
wretched
both
of
us
confess
said
harvey
do
quite
see
why
she
waited
after
she
is
a
good
gentle
girl
and
could
not
bear
to
make
her
father
and
mother
unhappy
the
blame
is
all
theirs
mean
shallow
grovelling
souls
about
her
mother
now
she
was
never
so
obstinate
as
the
old
jackass
she
have
little
enough
to
live
upon
and
we
shall
soon
arrange
things
with
her
somehow
is
it
credible
that
human
beings
can
be
so
senseless
for
years
now
their
means
have
been
growing
less
and
less
just
because
the
snobbish
idiot
keep
up
appearances
if
he
had
lived
a
little
longer
the
widow
would
have
had
practically
no
income
at
all
of
course
she
shared
in
the
folly
and
i
only
sorry
she
wo
suffer
more
for
it
they
did
enjoy
their
lives
never
have
done
they
lived
in
miserable
slavery
to
the
opinion
of
their
you
remember
that
story
about
the
flowers
at
their
silver
wedding
two
hundred
pounds
just
because
somebody
spent
as
much
when
they
could
really
afford
two
hundred
shillings
and
they
groaned
over
it
he
and
she
like
people
with
the
stomachache
why
the
old
fool
died
of
nothing
else
he
was
worn
out
by
the
fear
of
having
to
go
into
a
smaller
house
harvey
would
have
liked
to
put
a
question
was
it
possible
that
the
daughter
of
such
people
could
be
endowed
with
virtues
such
as
become
the
wife
of
a
comparatively
poor
man
but
he
had
to
ask
it
merely
in
his
own
thoughts
before
long
no
doubt
he
would
meet
the
lady
herself
and
appease
his
curiosity
whilst
they
were
talking
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
the
shopman
announced
two
ladies
who
wished
to
inquire
about
some
photographic
printing
you
see
them
rolfe
asked
cecil
do
feel
like
it
indeed
i
do
you
be
able
to
tell
them
all
they
want
harvey
found
himself
equal
to
the
occasion
and
was
glad
of
it
he
needed
occupation
of
some
kind
to
keep
his
thoughts
from
an
unpleasant
subject
after
another
talk
with
morphew
in
which
they
stuck
to
business
he
set
off
homeward
here
news
awaited
him
on
his
arrival
all
seemed
well
ruth
opened
the
door
answered
his
greeting
in
her
quiet
respectful
way
and
at
once
brought
tea
to
the
study
when
he
rang
to
have
the
things
taken
away
ruth
again
appeared
and
he
saw
now
that
she
had
something
unusual
to
say
did
like
to
trouble
you
the
first
thing
sir
she
began
sarah
left
yesterday
without
giving
any
notice
and
i
think
perhaps
as
well
she
did
sir
i
heard
some
things
about
her
not
at
all
nice
must
find
someone
else
then
replied
harvey
lucky
she
did
go
at
a
less
convenient
time
was
there
some
unpleasantness
between
you
had
warned
her
for
her
own
good
sir
that
was
all
and
something
else
i
had
perhaps
better
tell
you
now
sir
her
voice
with
its
pleasant
welsh
accent
faltered
ominously
very
sorry
indeed
to
say
it
sir
but
i
shall
be
obliged
to
leave
as
soon
as
rolfe
can
spare
me
harvey
was
overwhelmed
he
looked
upon
ruth
as
a
permanent
member
of
the
household
she
had
made
herself
indispensable
to
her
was
owing
the
freedom
from
domestic
harassment
which
alma
had
always
enjoyed
a
most
exceptional
blessing
yet
regarded
after
all
this
time
as
a
matter
of
course
the
departure
of
ruth
meant
conflict
with
ordinary
servants
in
which
alma
would
assuredly
be
worsted
at
this
critical
moment
of
their
life
scarcely
could
anything
more
disastrous
have
happened
seeing
her
master
consternation
ruth
was
sore
troubled
and
hastened
to
explain
herself
brother
wife
has
just
died
sir
and
left
him
with
three
young
children
and
there
no
one
else
can
be
of
help
to
him
but
me
he
wanted
me
to
come
at
once
but
of
course
i
told
him
i
could
do
that
no
one
can
be
sorry
for
his
wife
death
she
was
such
a
poor
silly
complaining
useless
creature
he
has
had
a
quiet
day
since
he
married
her
she
belonged
to
liverpool
and
there
they
were
married
and
when
he
brought
her
to
carnarvon
i
said
to
myself
as
soon
as
i
saw
her
that
would
be
much
use
to
a
she
began
the
very
first
day
to
complain
and
to
grumble
and
she
gone
on
with
it
ever
since
when
i
was
there
in
my
last
holiday
i
really
wondered
how
he
bore
his
life
there
many
women
of
that
kind
sir
but
i
never
knew
one
as
bad
as
her
never
everything
was
too
much
trouble
for
her
and
she
did
know
how
to
do
a
thing
in
the
house
i
did
mean
to
trouble
you
with
such
things
sir
i
only
told
you
just
to
show
why
i
do
feel
i
can
refuse
to
go
and
help
him
and
try
to
give
him
a
little
peace
and
quiet
he
a
man
and
the
children
are
very
healthy
and
i
sure
i
do
know
how
he
manage
have
no
choice
ruth
i
see
well
we
must
hope
to
find
some
one
in
your
place
just
as
he
shook
his
head
the
rang
and
ruth
withdrew
to
answer
it
in
a
minute
or
two
the
study
door
opened
again
harvey
looked
up
and
saw
alma
was
obliged
to
come
she
said
approaching
him
as
he
rose
in
astonishment
thought
at
first
of
asking
you
to
come
on
to
basingstoke
but
we
can
talk
better
here
no
sign
of
pleasure
in
their
meeting
passed
between
them
on
face
lingered
something
of
the
disturbance
caused
by
communication
and
alma
understood
it
as
due
to
her
unexpected
arrival
the
smile
with
which
she
had
entered
died
away
and
she
stood
like
a
stranger
doubtful
of
her
reception
it
necessary
to
talk
asked
rolfe
pushing
forward
a
chair
and
doing
his
best
to
show
good
humour
after
your
reply
to
my
letter
this
morning
she
answered
coldly
you
must
have
some
tea
first
this
is
cold
wo
you
go
and
take
your
things
off
and
i
tell
ruth
we
re
in
confusion
he
sketched
the
position
of
things
but
alma
heard
without
interest
ca
be
helped
was
her
absent
reply
are
plenty
of
servants
fresh
tea
was
brought
and
after
a
brief
absence
alma
sat
down
to
it
her
health
had
improved
during
the
past
week
but
she
looked
tired
from
the
journey
and
was
glad
to
lean
back
in
her
chair
for
some
minutes
neither
of
them
spoke
harvey
had
never
seen
an
expression
on
features
which
was
so
like
hostility
it
moved
him
to
serious
resentment
it
is
common
enough
for
people
who
have
been
several
years
wedded
to
feel
exasperation
in
each
other
presence
but
for
rolfe
the
experience
was
quite
new
and
so
extremely
disagreeable
that
his
pulses
throbbed
with
violence
and
his
mouth
grew
dry
he
determined
to
utter
not
a
word
until
alma
began
conversation
this
she
did
at
length
with
painful
effort
think
your
answer
to
me
was
very
unkind
did
mean
it
so
simply
said
that
you
would
do
as
i
wished
that
i
would
but
that
it
was
impossible
and
i
showed
you
the
reasons
though
i
should
have
thought
it
superfluous
alma
waited
a
moment
then
asked
this
house
let
do
know
i
suppose
not
there
is
no
reason
whatever
why
we
should
stay
here
is
every
reason
why
we
should
stay
here
every
arrangement
has
been
made
for
our
leaving
everything
fully
talked
over
what
has
made
you
change
your
mind
have
really
changed
my
mind
i
always
disliked
the
idea
of
going
to
gunnersbury
and
you
must
have
seen
that
i
did
but
i
was
so
much
occupied
with
with
other
things
and
as
i
have
told
you
i
feel
quite
the
same
about
my
position
as
i
do
now
she
expressed
herself
awkwardly
growing
very
nervous
at
the
first
sign
of
distress
in
her
harvey
was
able
to
change
his
tone
are
going
horribly
wrong
somehow
alma
there
only
one
way
out
of
it
just
say
in
honest
words
what
you
mean
why
do
you
dislike
the
thought
of
our
moving
told
you
in
my
letter
she
answered
somewhat
acridly
was
no
explanation
you
said
something
i
could
understand
about
having
a
to
ask
me
to
stay
here
she
glanced
at
him
with
incredulous
disdain
you
do
understand
i
ca
put
it
into
plainer
words
now
let
put
the
whole
matter
into
plainer
words
than
i
have
liked
to
use
rolfe
spoke
deliberately
and
not
unkindly
though
he
was
tempted
to
give
way
to
wrath
at
what
he
imagined
a
display
of
ignoble
and
groundless
jealousy
along
i
have
allowed
you
to
take
your
own
course
no
i
must
say
allowed
the
word
is
inapplicable
i
never
claimed
the
right
to
dictate
to
you
we
agreed
that
this
was
the
way
for
rational
husband
and
wife
it
seemed
to
us
that
i
had
no
more
right
to
rule
over
you
than
you
to
lay
down
the
law
for
me
using
your
freedom
you
chose
to
live
the
life
of
an
artist
that
is
to
say
you
troubled
yourself
as
little
as
possible
about
home
and
family
i
am
not
complaining
not
a
bit
of
it
the
thing
was
an
experiment
to
be
sure
but
i
have
held
to
the
conditions
watched
their
working
latterly
i
began
to
see
that
they
did
work
well
and
it
appears
that
you
agree
with
me
this
is
how
matters
stand
or
rather
this
is
how
they
stood
until
for
some
mysterious
reason
you
seemed
to
grow
unfriendly
the
reason
is
altogether
mysterious
i
leave
you
to
explain
it
from
my
point
of
view
the
failure
of
our
experiment
is
simple
and
natural
enough
though
i
had
only
myself
to
blame
i
have
felt
for
a
long
time
that
you
were
in
an
utterly
false
position
now
you
begin
to
see
things
in
the
same
light
well
and
good
why
ca
we
start
afresh
the
only
obstacle
is
your
unfriendly
feeling
give
me
an
opportunity
of
removing
it
i
hate
to
be
on
ill
terms
with
you
it
seems
monstrous
unaccountable
it
puts
us
on
a
level
with
married
folk
in
a
london
is
it
necessary
to
sink
quite
so
low
alma
listened
with
trembling
intensity
and
seemed
at
first
unable
to
reply
her
agitation
provoked
harvey
more
than
it
appealed
to
his
pity
you
ca
do
as
i
wish
she
said
at
length
with
an
endeavour
to
speak
calmly
see
no
use
in
making
any
change
in
my
own
life
there
will
be
no
need
of
me
i
shall
make
arrangements
to
go
on
with
my
professional
career
harvey
features
for
a
moment
set
themselves
in
combativeness
but
as
quickly
they
relaxed
and
showed
an
ambiguous
smile
need
of
you
and
ruth
going
to
leave
us
ought
to
be
any
difficulty
in
finding
someone
just
as
good
there
ought
not
to
be
but
we
may
thank
our
stars
if
we
find
anyone
half
as
trustworthy
the
chances
are
that
a
dozen
will
come
and
go
before
we
settle
down
again
i
do
enjoy
that
prospect
and
i
shall
want
a
good
deal
of
help
from
you
in
bearing
the
discomfort
kind
of
help
of
course
i
shall
see
that
the
house
goes
on
as
usual
it
quite
certain
you
will
have
no
time
left
for
a
professional
career
i
understand
you
you
mean
that
you
do
wish
me
to
have
any
time
for
it
harvey
still
smiled
though
he
could
not
conceal
his
nervousness
afraid
it
comes
to
that
so
little
had
alma
expected
such
a
declaration
that
she
gazed
at
him
in
frank
surprise
you
are
going
to
oppose
me
in
everything
hope
not
in
that
case
we
should
do
much
better
to
say
the
new
tone
perplexed
her
and
a
puzzled
interest
mingled
with
the
lofty
displeasure
of
her
look
let
us
understand
each
other
she
spoke
with
demonstrative
calmness
we
talking
on
equal
terms
or
is
it
master
and
servant
and
wife
alma
that
all
a
new
meaning
in
the
words
a
very
old
one
i
wo
say
the
oldest
for
i
believe
there
was
a
time
when
primitive
woman
had
the
making
of
man
in
every
sense
and
somehow
knocked
a
few
ideas
into
his
head
but
that
was
very
long
ago
i
could
be
sure
of
your
real
meaning
she
made
an
irritated
gesture
are
we
going
to
live
you
speak
of
married
people
in
i
do
know
much
about
them
happily
but
i
imagine
the
husband
talks
something
like
this
though
in
more
intelligible
language
dare
say
he
does
poor
man
he
talks
more
plainly
because
he
has
never
put
himself
in
a
false
position
has
never
played
foolishly
with
the
facts
of
life
alma
sat
reflecting
i
tell
you
in
my
letter
she
said
at
length
i
was
quite
willing
to
make
a
change
on
one
condition
impossible
condition
treat
me
very
harshly
how
have
i
deserved
it
when
i
wrote
that
i
really
wished
to
please
you
of
course
i
knew
you
were
dissatisfied
with
me
and
it
made
me
dissatisfied
with
myself
i
wrote
in
a
way
that
ought
to
have
brought
me
a
very
different
answer
why
do
you
behave
as
if
i
were
guilty
of
something
as
if
i
had
put
myself
at
your
mercy
you
never
found
fault
with
me
you
even
encouraged
me
to
go
on
her
choking
voice
made
harvey
look
at
her
in
apprehension
and
the
look
stopped
her
just
as
she
was
growing
hysterical
are
right
about
my
letter
he
said
very
gravely
and
quietly
ought
to
have
been
in
a
kinder
tone
it
would
have
been
but
for
those
words
you
wo
explain
think
it
needs
any
explanation
that
i
dislike
the
thought
of
hughie
going
to
mrs
abbott
i
do
i
ca
imagine
a
valid
ground
for
your
objection
there
was
a
word
on
alma
tongue
but
her
lips
would
not
utter
it
she
turned
very
pale
under
the
mental
conflict
physical
weakness
instead
of
overcoming
her
spirit
excited
it
to
a
fresh
effort
of
resistance
she
said
rising
from
the
chair
are
not
only
unkind
to
me
but
dishonest
harvey
flushed
are
making
yourself
ill
again
we
had
far
better
not
talk
at
all
came
up
for
no
other
purpose
we
have
to
settle
everything
far
as
i
am
concerned
everything
is
settled
i
have
no
choice
said
alma
with
subdued
passion
shall
live
as
we
have
done
i
shall
accept
any
engagement
that

the
country
and

as
my
chief
concern
you
wished
it
and
so
it
shall
be
rolfe
hesitated
believing
that
her
illness
was
the
real
cause
of
this
commotion
he
felt
it
his
duty
to
use
all
possible
forbearance
yet
he
knew
too
well
the
danger
of
once
more
yielding
and
at
such
a
crisis
the
contest
had
declared
itself
it
was
will
against
will
to
decide
it
by
the
exertion
of
his
sane
strength
against
alma
hysteria
might
be
best
even
for
the
moment
he
had
wrought
himself
to
the
point
of
unwonted
energy
a
state
of
body
and
mind
difficult
to
recover
if
now
he
suffered
defeat
alma
turning
from
him
seemed
about
to
leave
the
room
moment
she
looked
round
carelessly
attentive
would
be
living
as
we
have
done
it
would
be
an
intolerable
state
of
things
after
this
your
own
decision
from
it
i
would
put
up
with
it
for
a
day
there
only
one
thing
left
i
must
go
and
live
by
myself
could
stand
that
either
and
would
try
am
no
slave
i
shall
live
where
and
how
i
choose
you
have
thought
about
it
more
calmly
your
choice
will
be
the
same
as
mine
trembling
violently
she
backed
away
from
him
harvey
thought
she
would
fall
he
tried
to
hold
her
by
the
arm
but
alma
shook
him
off
and
in
the
same
moment
regained
her
strength
she
faced
him
with
a
new
defiance
which
enabled
her
at
last
to
speak
the
words
hitherto
unutterable
do
you
think
i
can
bear
to
see
hughie
with
children
rolfe
stood
in
amaze
the
suddenness
of
this
reversion
to
another
stage
of
their
argument
enhanced
his
natural
difficulty
in
understanding
her
children
two
whatever
their
name
may
be
boy
and
girl
call
them
so
you
going
crazy
i
them
so
what
do
you
mean
a
sudden
misgiving
appeared
in
alma
eyes
she
stared
at
him
so
strangely
that
harvey
began
to
fear
for
her
reason
is
it
dear
what
have
you
been
thinking
tell
me
speak
like
yourself
do
you
take
so
much
interest
in
them
she
asked
faintly
you
have
suspected
what
you
suspected
are
your
own
i
have
known
it
for
a
long
time
alarm
notwithstanding
rolfe
was
so
struck
by
the
absurdity
of
this
charge
that
he
burst
into
stentorian
laughter
whilst
he
laughed
alma
sank
into
a
chair
powerless
tearful
should
much
like
to
know
exclaimed
harvey
laying
a
hand
upon
her
you
made
that
astounding
discovery
do
you
think
they
are
like
me
girl
is
or
i
thought
so
you
had
decided
that
she
must
be
no
doubt
again
he
exploded
in
laughter
this
is
the
meaning
of
it
all
this
is
what
you
have
been
fretting
over
for
how
long
alma
brushed
away
her
tears
but
gave
no
answer
if
i
am
their
father
he
pursued
with
resolute
mirthfulness
who
do
you
suppose
their
mother
to
be
still
alma
kept
silence
her
head
bent
warrant
i
can
give
you
evidence
against
myself
which
you
discovered
rolfe
went
on
and
unanswerable
evidence
it
is
i
who
support
those
children
and
pay
for
their
education
it
is
i
and
no
other
see
your
darkest
suspicion
confirmed
if
only
you
had
known
this
for
certain
then
do
you
do
it
asked
alma
without
raising
her
eyes
a
very
foolish
reason
there
was
no
one
else
who
could
or
would
why
did
you
keep
it
a
secret
from
me
is
the
blackest
part
of
the
whole
gloomy
affair
he
answered
with
burlesque
gravity
in
the
depraved
nature
of
men
to
keep
secrets
from
their
wives
especially
about
money
to
tell
the
truth
i
hanged
if
i
know
why
i
did
tell
you
before
our
marriage
the
infamous
step
was
taken
not
very
long
before
and
i
might
as
well
have
made
a
clean
breast
of
it
has
abbott
never
spoken
to
you
about
her
cousin
wager
wife
word
or
two
you
took
for
artful
fiction
you
imagined
she
had
plotted
with
me
to
deceive
you
what
in
the
name
of
commonsense
is
your
estimate
of
abbott
character
alma
drew
a
deep
breath
and
looked
up
into
her
husband
face
she
knew
you
were
keeping
it
from
me
about
the
money
had
no
suspicion
of
it
she
always
wrote
to
me
openly
acknowledging
the
cheques
would
it
gratify
you
to
look
through
her
letters
believe
you
quite
i
fancy
look
at
me
again
and
say
it
he
raised
her
head
gently
i
believe
you
it
was
very
silly
was
the
only
piece
of
downright
feminine
foolishness
i
ever
knew
you
guilty
of
but
when
did
it
begin
alma
had
become
strangely
quiet
she
spoke
in
a
low
tired
voice
and
sat
with
head
turned
aside
resting
against
the
back
of
the
chair
her
face
was
expressionless
her
eyelids
drooped
rolfe
had
to
repeat
his
question
hardly
know
she
replied
must
have
been
when
my
illness
was
coming
on
i
should
think
it
was
sheer
frenzy
and
now
that
it
over
have
you
still
any
prejudice
against
mrs
abbott
the
syllable
fell
idly
from
her
lips
are
tired
dear
all
this
sound
and
fury
has
been
too
much
for
you
lie
down
on
the
sofa
till
she
allowed
him
to
lead
her
across
the
room
and
lay
down
as
he
wished
to
his
kiss
upon
her
forehead
she
made
no
response
but
closed
her
eyes
and
was
very
still
harvey
seated
himself
at
his
desk
and
opened
two
or
three
unimportant
letters
which
had
arrived
this
morning
to
one
of
them
he
wrote
an
answer
turning
presently
to
glance
at
alma
he
saw
that
she
had
not
stirred
and
when
he
leaned
towards
her
the
sound
of
her
breathing
told
him
that
she
was
asleep
he
meditated
on
woman
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
he
left
the
room
on
his
return
when
the
meal
was
ready
he
found
alma
still
sleeping
and
so
soundly
that
it
seemed
wrong
to
wake
her
as
rays
of
sunset
had
begun
to
fall
into
the
room
he
drew
the
blind
then
quietly
went
out
and
had
dinner
by
himself
at
ten
alma
still
slept
using
a
lamp
harvey
sat
in
the
room
with
her
and
read
or
seemed
to
read
for
ever
and
again
his
eyes
strayed
to
the
still
figure
and
his
thoughts
wandered
over
all
he
knew
of
alma
life
he
wished
he
knew
more
that
he
might
better
understand
her
of
her
childhood
her
early
maidenhood
what
conception
had
he
yet
he
and
she
were
so
said
the
creeds
and
harvey
laughed
to
himself
a
laugh
more
of
melancholy
than
of
derision
the
clock
ticked
on
it
was
near
to
eleven
then
alma
stirred
raised
herself
and
looked
towards
the
light
have
i
been
asleep
so
long
five
hours
that
was
last
night
mean
you
had
no
sleep
close
my
eyes
you
feel
better
now
hungry
rolfe
laughed
he
had
seated
himself
on
the
couch
by
her
and
held
her
in
his
arms
then
we
have
some
supper
a
cold
fowl
and
a
bottle
of
burgundy
a
profligate
supper
fit
for
such
abandoned
characters
and
over
it
you
shall
tell
me
how
the
world
looked
to
you
when
you
were
ten
years
old
chapter
alma
returned
to
basingstoke
and
remained
there
until
the
new
house
was
ready
for
her
reception
with
the
help
of
her
country
friends
she
engaged
two
domestics
cook
and
housemaid
who
were
despatched
to
gunnersbury
in
advance
they
had
good
and
might
possibly
with
their
new
mistress
in
her
resolve
to
create
an
admirable
household
into
this
ambition
alma
had
thrown
herself
with
no
less
fervour
than
that
which
carried
her
off
to
wild
wales
five
years
ago
but
her
aim
was
now
strictly
she
would
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
she
took
lessons
in
domestic
economy
from
the
good
people
at
basingstoke
yes
she
had
found
her
way
at
last
alma
saw
it
in
the
glow
of
a
discovery
this
calm
secure
and
graceful
she
talked
of
it
with
an
animation
that
surprised
and
pleased
her
little
circle
down
in
hampshire
those
ladies
had
never
been
able
to
illumine
their
everyday
discharge
of
duty
with
such
high
imaginative
glory
in
return
for
their
humble
lessons
alma
taught
them
to
admire
themselves
to
see
in
their
place
and
functions
a
nobility
they
had
never
suspected
for
a
day
or
two
after
her
arrival
at
gunnersbury
harvey
thought
that
he
had
never
seen
her
look
so
well
certainly
she
had
never
shown
the
possibilities
of
her
character
to
such
advantage
it
seemed
out
of
the
question
that
any
trouble
could
ever
again
come
between
them
only
when
the
excitement
of
novelty
had
subsided
did
he
perceive
that
alma
was
far
from
having
recovered
her
physical
strength
a
walk
of
a
mile
or
two
exhausted
her
she
came
home
from
an
hour
exercise
with
hughie
pale
and
tremulous
and
of
a
morning
it
was
often
to
be
noticed
that
she
had
not
slept
well
without
talking
of
it
harvey
planned
the
holiday
which
alma
had
declared
would
be
quite
needless
this
year
he
took
a
house
in
norfolk
for
september
before
the
day
of
departure
alma
had
something
to
tell
him
which
by
suggesting
natural
explanation
of
her
weakness
made
him
less
uneasy
remembering
the
incident
which
had
brought
to
a
close
their
life
in
wales
he
saw
with
pleasure
that
alma
no
longer
revolted
against
the
common
lot
of
woman
perhaps
indeed
the
announcement
she
made
to
him
was
the
cause
of
more
anxiety
in
his
mind
than
in
hers
they
took
their
servants
with
them
and
left
the
house
to
a
caretaker
pauline
smith
though
somewhat
against
harvey
judgment
had
been
called
upon
to
resign
alma
wished
to
have
hughie
to
herself
save
during
his
school
hours
he
slept
in
her
room
and
she
tended
him
most
conscientiously
harvey
had
asked
whether
she
would
like
to
invite
any
one
but
she
preferred
to
be
alone
this
month
by
the
northern
sea
improved
her
health
but
she
had
little
enjoyment
after
a
few
days
she
wearied
of
the
shore
and
the
moorland
and
wished
herself
back
at
gunnersbury
nature
had
never
made
much
appeal
to
her
when
she
spoke
of
its
beauties
with
admiration
she
echoed
the
approved
phrases
little
more
all
her
instincts
drew
towards
the
life
of
a
great
town
sitting
upon
the
sand
between
cliff
and
breakers
she
lost
herself
in
a
dream
of
thronged
streets
and
brilliant
rooms
the
voice
of
the
waves
became
the
roar
of
traffic
a
far
sweeter
music
with
every
year
this
tendency
had
grown
stronger
she
could
only
marvel
now
at
the
illusion
which
enabled
her
to
live
so
long
all
but
contentedly
in
that
wilderness
where
hughie
was
born
rather
than
return
to
it
she
would
die
rather
a
thousand
times
happily
there
was
no
such
danger
harvey
would
never
ask
her
to
leave
london
all
he
desired
was
that
she
should
hold
apart
from
certain
currents
of
town
life
and
this
she
was
resolved
to
do
knowing
how
nearly
they
had
swept
her
to
destruction
you
like
to
take
up
your
sketching
again
said
harvey
one
day
when
he
saw
that
she
felt
dull
oh
i
had
forgotten
all
about
it
it
seems
ages
ago
i
should
have
to
begin
and
learn
all
over
again
no
no
it
is
worth
while
i
shall
have
no
time
she
did
not
speak
discontentedly
but
rolfe
saw
already
the
justification
of
his
misgivings
she
had
begun
to
feel
the
constant
presence
of
the
child
a
restraint
and
a
burden
happily
on
their
return
home
hughie
would
go
to
school
for
a
couple
of
hours
each
morning
alma
could
have
wished
it
any
other
school
than
mary
abbott
but
the
thought
was
no
longer
so
insupportable
as
when
she
suffered
under
her
delusion
concerning
the
two
children
now
that
she
had
frequently
seen
minnie
wager
she
wondered
at
the
which
allowed
her
to
detect
in
the
child
face
a
distinct
resemblance
to
harvey
of
course
there
was
nothing
of
the
kind
she
had
been
the
victim
of
a
morbid
jealousy
a
symptom
no
doubt
of
the
disorder
of
the
nerves
which
was
growing
upon
her
yet
she
could
not
overcome
her
antipathy
to
mary
abbott
harvey
she
felt
sure
would
never
have
made
himself
responsible
for
those
children
but
that
in
doing
so
he
benefited
their
teacher
and
it
was
not
without
motive
of
conscience
that
he
kept
the
matter
secret
by
no
effort
could
alma
banish
this
suspicion
she
resolved
that
it
should
never
appear
she
commanded
her
face
and
her
utterance
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
ever
to
regard
abbott
with
liking
or
even
with
respect
in
a
darker
corner
of
her
mind
lay
hidden
another
shape
of
jealousy
jealousy
unavowed
often
disguised
as
fear
but
for
the
most
part
betraying
itself
through
the
mask
of
hatred
times
innumerable
in
nights
that
brought
no
rest
and
through
long
hours
of
weary
day
alma
had
put
her
heart
to
the
proof
and
acquitted
it
of
any
feeling
save
a
natural
compassion
for
the
man
hugh
carnaby
had
killed
she
had
never
loved
redgrave
had
never
even
thought
of
him
with
that
curiosity
which
piques
the
flesh
yet
so
inseparably
was
he
associated
with
her
life
at
its
points
of
utmost
tension
and
ardour
that
she
could
not
bear
to
yield
to
any
other
woman
a
closer
intimacy
a
prior
claim
at
her
peril
she
had
tempted
him
and
up
to
the
fatal
moment
she
was
still
holding
her
own
in
the
game
which
had
become
to
her
a
passion
it
ended
because
a
rival
came
between
of
sibyl
guilt
she
never
admitted
a
doubt
it
was
manifest
in
the
story
made
public
by
hugh
carnaby
the
story
which
he
great
simple
fellow
told
in
all
good
faith
relying
absolutely
on
his
wife
assertion
of
innocence
saving
her
husband
who
believed
sibyl
innocent
she
flattered
herself
with
the
persuasion
that
it
was
right
to
hate
sibyl
a
woman
who
had
sold
herself
for
money
whose
dishonour
differed
in
no
respect
from
that
of
the
woman
of
the
pavement
and
all
the
more
she
hated
her
because
she
feared
her
what
security
could
there
be
that
redgrave
murderer
thus
she
thought
of
him
had
kept
the
secret
which
he
promised
to
keep
that
he
allowed
no
hint
of
it
to
escape
him
in
public
did
not
prove
that
he
had
been
equally
scrupulous
with
sibyl
for
hugh
was
a
mere
plaything
in
the
hands
of
his
wife
and
it
seemed
more
than
likely
that
he
had
put
his
stupid
conscience
at
rest
by
telling
her
everything
were
it
so
what
motive
would
weigh
with
sibyl
to
keep
her
silent
one
and
one
only
could
be
divined
a
fear
lest
alma
through
intimacy
with
redgrave
might
have
discovered
things
which
put
her
in
a
position
to
dare
the
enmity
of
her
former
friend
this
no
doubt
would
hold
sibyl
to
discretion
yet
it
could
not
relieve
alma
from
the
fear
of
her
and
of
hugh
carnaby
himself
fear
which
must
last
a
lifetime
which
at
any
moment
perhaps
long
years
hence
might
find
its
bitter
fulfilment
and
work
her
ruin
for
harvey
rolfe
was
not
a
man
of
the
stamp
of
hugh
carnaby
he
would
not
be
hoodwinked
in
the
face
of
damning
evidence
or
lend
easy
ear
to
specious
explanations
the
very
fact
that
she
explain
her
ambiguous
behaviour
was
to
alma
an
enhancement
of
the
dread
with
which
she
thought
of
such
a
scene
between
herself
and
harvey
for
to
be
innocent
and
yet
unable
to
force
conviction
of
it
upon
his
inmost
mind
would
cause
her
a
deeper
anguish
than
to
fall
before
him
with
confession
of
guilt
and
to
convince
him
would
be
impossible
for
ever
impossible
say
what
she
might
and
however
generous
the
response
of
his
love
there
must
still
remain
the
doubt
which
attaches
to
a
when
at
the
same
time
she
is
a
in
the
of
her
illness
whilst
waiting
in
torment
for
the
assurance
that
carnaby
had
kept
her
secret
she
more
than
once
prayed
for
sibyl
death
in
her
normal
state
of
mind
alma
prayed
for
nothing
she
could
not
hope
that
sibyl
life
would
come
to
a
convenient
end
but
as
often
as
she
thought
of
her
it
was
with
a
vehemence
of
malignity
which
fired
her
imagination
to
all
manner
of
ruthless
extremes
it
revolted
her
to
look
back
upon
the
time
when
she
sat
at
that
woman
feet
a
disciple
an
affectionate
admirer
allowing
herself
to
be
graciously
patronised
counselled
encouraged
the
repose
of
manner
which
so
impressed
her
the
habitual
serenity
of
mood
the
unvarying
oh
these
were
excellent
qualities
when
it
came
to
playing
the
high
part
of
cold
and
subtle
hypocrisy
she
knew
sibyl
and
could
follow
the
workings
of
her
mind
a
woman
incapable
of
love
or
of
the
passion
which
simulates
it
worshipping
herself
offering
luxuries
to
her
cold
flesh
as
to
an
idol
scornful
of
the
possibility
that
she
might
ever
come
to
lack
what
she
desired
and
at
the
critical
moment
prompt
to
secure
herself
against
such
danger
by
the
smiling
cynical
acceptance
of
whatsoever
shame
alma
had
no
small
gift
of
intuition
proved
by
the
facility
and
fervour
with
which
she
could
adapt
her
mind
to
widely
different
conceptions
of
life
this
characteristic
aided
by
the
perspicacity
which
is
bestowed
upon
every
jealous
woman
perchance
enabled
her
to
read
the
mysterious
sibyl
with
some
approach
to
exactness
were
it
so
prudence
should
have
warned
her
against
a
struggle
for
mere
hatred
sake
with
so
formidable
an
antagonist
but
the
voice
of
caution
had
never
long
audience
with
alma
and
was
not
likely
at
any
given
moment
to
prevail
against
a
transport
of
her
impetuous
soul
harvey
meanwhile
fearing
her
inclination
to
brood
over
the
dark
event
tried
to
behave
as
though
he
had
utterly
dismissed
it
from
his
thoughts
he
kept
a
cheerful
countenance
talked
much
more
than
usual
and
seemed
full
of
health
and
hope
as
usual
between
married
people
this
resolute
cheerfulness
had
more
often
than
not
an
irritating
effect
upon
alma
rolfe
erred
once
more
in
preferring
to
keep
silence
about
difficulties
rather
than
face
the
unpleasantness
of
frankly
discussing
them
one
good
long
intimate
conversation
about
carnaby
with
unrestricted
exchange
of
views
the
masculine
and
the
feminine
with
liberal
acceptance
of
life
as
it
is
lived
and
honest
contempt
of
leering
hypocrisies
would
have
done
more
at
this
juncture
to
put
healthy
tone
into
alma
being
than
any
change
of
scene
and
of
atmosphere
any
medicament
or
summons
to
forgetfulness
like
the
majority
of
good
and
thoughtful
men
he
could
not
weigh
his
female
companion
in
the
balance
he
found
good
enough
for
mortals
of
his
own
sex
with
a
little
obtuseness
to
the
feelings
a
little
native
coarseness
in
his
habits
towards
women
he
would
have
succeeded
vastly
better
amid
the
complications
of
his
married
life
troubles
of
a
grosser
kind
such
as
heretofore
they
had
been
wonderfully
spared
began
to
assail
them
during
their
month
in
norfolk
one
morning
about
midway
in
the
holiday
harvey
as
he
came
down
for
a
bathe
before
breakfast
heard
loud
and
angry
voices
from
the
kitchen
on
his
return
after
bathing
he
found
the
very
carelessly
laid
with
knives
unpolished
and
other
such
neglects
of
seemliness
alma
appearing
with
hughie
spoke
at
once
of
the
strange
noises
she
had
heard
and
harvey
gave
his
account
of
the
uproar
thought
something
was
wrong
said
alma
cook
has
seemed
in
a
bad
temper
for
several
days
i
do
like
either
of
them
i
think
i
shall
give
them
both
notice
and
advertise
at
once
they
say
that
advertising
is
the
best
way
the
housemaid
in
her
secondary
function
of
waited
at
table
with
a
scowl
the
fish
was
ill
fried
the
eggs
were
hard
the
toast
was
for
the
moment
alma
made
no
remark
but
half
an
hour
later
when
harvey
and
the
child
had
rambled
off
to
the
she
summoned
both
domestics
and
demanded
an
explanation
of
their
behaviour
her
tone
was
not
conciliatory
she
had
neither
the
experience
nor
the
tact
which
are
necessary
in
the
mistress
of
a
household
and
it
needed
only
an
occasion
such
as
this
to
bring
out
the
contemptuousness
with
which
she
regarded
her
social
inferiors
too
to
indulge
in
scolding
or
wrangling
the
delight
of
a
large
class
of
housewives
alma
had
a
quiet
way
of
exhibiting
displeasure
and
scorn
which
told
smartly
on
the
nerves
of
those
she
rebuked
no
one
could
better
have
illustrated
the
crucial
difficulty
of
the
which
lies
in
the
fact
that
women
seldom
can
rule
and
all
but
invariably
dislike
to
be
ruled
by
their
own
sex
a
difficulty
which
increases
with
the
of
social
distinctions
she
went
out
into
the
sunshine
and
found
harvey
and
hughie
building
a
great
castle
of
sand
her
mood
was
lightsome
for
she
felt
that
she
had
acted
with
decision
and
in
a
way
worthy
of
her
dignity
will
both
go
about
their
business
i
only
hope
we
may
get
meals
for
the
rest
of
the
time
here
harvey
nodded
with
closed
lips
a
pity
pauline
went
he
remarked
presently
afraid
it
is
i
had
quite
realised
what
it
would
mean
rather
think
i
ventured
to
say
something
of
that
kind
did
i
she
not
have
taken
another
place
suppose
you
write
to
her
alma
seemed
to
waver
i
am
thinking
she
said
in
a
lower
tone
that
before
long
we
shall
need
i
suppose
someone
of
a
rather
different
kind
an
ordinary
but
you
would
like
hughie
to
be
with
anyone
of
that
sort
would
matter
now
the
philosophy
of
the
matter
in
a
said
harvey
afterwards
nowadays
means
keeping
up
appearances
and
you
must
do
it
just
as
carefully
before
your
own
servants
as
before
your
friends
the
alternatives
are
one
general
servant
with
frank
confession
of
poverty
or
a
numerous
household
and
everything
il
there
no
middle
way
with
peace
i
think
your
determination
to
take
care
of
hughie
yourself
was
admirable
but
it
wo
work
these
two
women
think
you
do
it
because
you
ca
afford
a
nurse
and
at
once
they
despise
us
it
the
nature
of
the
beasts
it
the
tone
of
the
time
nothing
will
keep
them
and
their
like
in
subordination
but
a
jingling
of
the
purse
one
must
say
to
them
all
day
long
i
am
your
superior
i
can
buy
you
by
the
dozen
if
need
be
i
never
need
soil
my
finger
with
any
sort
of
work
and
you
know
it
ruth
was
a
good
creature
but
i
seriously
doubt
whether
she
would
have
been
quite
so
good
if
she
had
seen
us
keeping
our
horse
and
our
gardener
and
our
groom
down
yonder
everything
handsome
about
us
for
the
sake
of
quietness
we
must
exalt
ourselves
quite
right
about
ruth
replied
alma
laughing
times
she
has
let
me
see
how
she
admired
my
life
of
idleness
but
it
just
that
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
need
ruth
was
practically
a
housekeeper
you
can
manage
your
own
house
but
you
must
have
a
servant
for
everything
get
a
nurse
by
all
means
alma
drew
a
breath
of
contentment
are
not
dissatisfied
with
harvey
course
not
tell
me
how
does
morton
manage
why
is
she
despised
by
her
servants
when
she
always
so
busy
harvey
had
to
close
his
lips
against
the
first
answer
which
occurred
to
him
one
thing
he
replied
a
more
natural
state
of
things
in
those
little
towns
something
of
the
old
spirit
still
lives
then
the
mortons
have
the
immense
advantage
of
being
an
old
family
settled
there
for
generations
known
and
respected
by
everyone
that
a
kind
of
superiority
one
ca
buy
and
goes
for
a
great
deal
in
comfortable
living
morton
servants
are
the
daughters
of
people
who
served
his
parents
from
their
childhood
they
have
thought
it
would
be
a
privilege
to
get
into
that
house
in
london
you
are
a
duchess
a
pleasant
thing
it
must
be
said
alma
musingly
have
ancestors
harvey
chuckled
next
best
thing
is
to
have
descendants
then
exclaimed
alma
become
ancestors
ourselves
but
one
ought
to
have
an
interesting
house
to
live
in
nobody
ancestors
ever
lived
in
a
villa
what
i
should
like
would
be
one
of
those
picturesque
old
places
down
in
surrey
quite
in
the
country
yet
within
easy
reach
of
town
a
house
with
a
real
garden
and
perhaps
an
orchard
i
believe
you
can
get
them
very
cheap
sometimes
not
rent
the
house
but
buy
it
then
we
would
have
our
portraits
painted
and
harvey
asked
himself
how
long
alma
would
find
satisfaction
in
such
a
home
but
it
pleased
him
to
hear
her
talking
thus
of
the
things
which
were
his
own
hopeless
dream
reminds
me
alma
you
have
never
sat
yet
for
your
picture
as
i
said
you
should
must
wait
now
shall
be
done
next
year
they
were
content
with
each
other
this
evening
and
looked
forward
to
pleasures
they
might
have
in
common
for
harvey
had
learnt
to
nourish
only
the
humblest
hopes
and
alma
thought
she
had
subdued
herself
to
an
undistinguished
destiny
chapter
determined
to
have
done
once
for
all
with
a
task
she
loathed
alma
wrote
out
her
advertisements
for
cook
and
nurse
and
sent
them
to
half
a
dozen
newspapers
after
three
weeks
of
correspondence
with
servants
and
mistresses
a
correspondence
which
as
rolfe
said
would
have
made
a
printed
volume
of
higher
sociological
interest
than
anything
yet
published
or
likely
to
be
the
end
of
her
patience
and
her
strength
compelled
her
to
decide
half
desperately
and
engage
the
three
young
women
who
appeared
least
insolent
at
the
same
time
she
had
to
find
a
new
boy
for
boots
windows
knives
and
coals
the
youngster
hitherto
employed
having
been
so
successful
with
his
on
kempton
park
and
hurst
park
september
meetings
that
he
relinquished
menial
duties
and
devoted
himself
wholly
to
the
turf
but
this
was
such
a
simple
matter
compared
with
the
engaging
of
indoor
domestics
that
she
felt
it
almost
a
delight
when
a
strong
lad
presented
himself
eager
for
the
job
and
speaking
not
a
word
that
was
beside
the
point
alma
could
have
patted
his
head
she
amused
harvey
that
evening
by
exclaiming
with
the
very
accent
of
sincerity
i
like
men
and
how
i
detest
women
her
nerves
were
so
upset
again
that
when
all
was
over
she
generally
slept
pretty
well
but
now
her
insomnia
returned
and
had
to
keep
her
bed
for
a
day
or
two
at
the
she
had
once
more
she
had
recourse
to
the
fashionable
specific
harvey
knew
nothing
of
this
she
was
careful
to
hide
it
from
him
and
each
time
she
measured
out
her
dose
she
assured
herself
that
it
should
be
the
last
oh
but
to
lie
through
those
terrible
small
hours
her
brain
feverishly
active
compelling
her
to
live
again
in
the
scenes
and
the
emotions
she
most
desired
to
forget
she
was
haunted
by
the
voice
of
cyrus
redgrave
which
at
times
grew
so
distinct
to
her
hearing
that
it
became
an
hallucination
her
memory
reproduced
his
talk
with
astonishing
fidelity
it
was
as
though
she
had
learnt
it
by
heart
instead
of
merely
listening
to
it
at
the
time
this
only
in
the
silence
of
night
during
the
day
she
could
not
possibly
have
recalled
a
tenth
of
what
her
brain
thus
treacherously
preserved
in
sleep
she
sometimes
dreamt
of
him
and
that
was
perhaps
worse
for
whilst
the
waking
illusion
only
reproduced
what
he
had
actually
said
with
all
his
tricks
of
tone
his
suavities
of
expression
sleep
brought
before
her
another
redgrave
he
looked
at
her
with
a
smile
indeed
but
a
smile
of
such
unutterable
malignity
that
she
froze
with
terror
it
was
always
the
same
redgrave
stood
before
her
smiling
silent
stood
and
gazed
until
in
a
paroxysm
of
anguish
she
cried
out
and
broke
the
dream
once
whilst
the
agony
was
upon
her
she
sprang
from
bed
meaning
to
go
to
her
husband
and
tell
him
everything
and
so
it
might
be
put
an
end
to
her
sufferings
but
with
her
hand
upon
the
door
she
lost
courage
impossible
she
could
not
hope
to
be
believed
she
could
never
convince
her
husband
that
she
had
told
him
all
upon
lay
the
guilt
of
redgrave
death
this
had
entered
slowly
into
her
consciousness
at
first
rejected
but
ever
returning
until
the
last
argument
of
gave
way
but
for
her
visit
to
the
bungalow
that
evening
hugh
carnaby
would
not
have
been
maddened
to
the
point
of
fatal
violence
in
the
obscurity
he
had
mistaken
her
figure
for
that
of
sibyl
and
when
redgrave
guarded
her
retreat
he
paid
for
the
impulse
with
his
life
on
the
sunday
before
her
concert
she
had
thought
of
going
to
see
redgrave
but
the
risk
seemed
too
great
and
there
was
no
certainty
of
finding
him
at
home
she
wished
above
all
things
to
see
him
for
there
was
a
suspicion
in
her
mind
that
strangeways
had
a
plot
against
her
though
of
its
nature
she
could
form
no
idea
it
might
be
true
that
redgrave
was
purposely
holding
aloof
whether
out
of
real
jealousy
or
simply
as
a
stratagem
a
new
move
in
the
game
she
would
not
write
to
him
she
knew
the
danger
of
letters
and
had
been
careful
never
to
write
him
even
the
simplest
note
if
she
must
remain
in
uncertainty
about
his
attitude
towards
her
the
approaching
ordeal
would
be
intensified
with
a
new
agitation
was
he
coming
to
her
recital
or
was
he
not
she
had
counted
upon
triumphing
before
him
if
he
could
stay
away
her
power
over
him
was
incomplete
and
at
the
moment
when
she
had
meant
it
to
be
irresistible
the
chance
encounter
on
monday
with
hugh
carnaby
made
her
think
of
sibyl
and
she
could
not
rest
until
she
had
endeavoured
to
learn
something
of
sibyl
movements
as
carnaby
was
leaving
town
his
wife
would
be
free
and
how
did
sibyl
use
her
freedom
on
that
subject
mrs
strangeways
had
a
decided
opinion
and
her
knowledge
of
the
world
made
it
more
than
probable
that
she
was
right
without
any
scheme
of
espionage
obeying
her
instinct
of
jealous
enmity
alma
hastened
to
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
but
sibyl
had
left
home
and
was
not
expected
to
return
that
night
how
she
spent
the
next
few
hours
alma
could
but
dimly
remember
it
was
a
vortex
of
wretchedness
as
dark
fell
she
found
herself
at
the
gate
leading
to
the
bungalow
lurking
listening
waiting
for
courage
to
go
farther
she
stole
at
length
over
the
grass
behind
the
bushes
until
she
could
see
the
lighted
window
of
redgrave
study
the
window
was
open
she
crept
nearer
and
nearer
till
she
was
actually
in
the
veranda
and
looking
into
the
room
redgrave
sat
within
smoking
and
reading
a
newspaper
she
purposely
made
a
movement
which
drew
his
attention
how
would
it
have
ended
but
for
hugh
carnaby
beyond
ascertaining
that
sibyl
was
not
there
she
had
of
course
discovered
nothing
of
what
she
wished
to
know
as
likely
as
not
she
had
come
too
early
redgrave
behaviour
when
she
drew
his
attention
suggested
that
such
a
sound
at
the
open
window
did
not
greatly
surprise
him
the
surprise
appeared
when
he
saw
who
stood
there
surprise
and
momentary
embarrassment
which
would
be
natural
enough
if
he
expected
a
different
visitor
and
he
was
so
anxious
that
she
should
come
in
at
once
had
she
done
so
redgrave
life
would
have
been
saved
but
its
having
been
publicly
proved
that
carnaby
was
then
far
away
from
wimbledon
did
not
tend
to
shake
alma
conviction
the
summons
to
her
mother
deathbed
had
disturbed
sibyl
arrangements
that
was
all
most
luckily
for
her
as
it
turned
out
but
women
of
that
kind
said
alma
bitterly
are
favoured
by
fortune
locked
in
a
drawer
of
her
lay
a
bundle
of
letters
and
papers
which
had
come
to
her
immediately
after
the
concert
to
none
of
the
letters
had
she
replied
it
was
time
for
her
to
go
through
them
and
answer
with
due
apologies
those
which
deserved
an
answer
several
did
not
they
were
from
people
whom
she
hoped
never
to
see
again
people
who
wrote
in
fulsome
terms
because
they
fancied
she
would
become
a
celebrity
the
news
of
her
breakdown
had
appeared
in
a
few
newspapers
and
brought
her
letters
of
sympathy
these
also
lay
unanswered
on
a
day
of
late
autumn
she
brought
herself
to
the
task
of
looking
through
this
correspondence
and
in
the
end
she
burnt
it
all
among
the
people
to
whom
she
decided
to
write
was
felix
dymes
not
out
of
gratitude
or
any
feeling
of
friendliness
but
because
she
could
not
overcome
a
certain
fear
of
the
man
he
was
capable
of
any
meanness
perhaps
of
villainy
and
perhaps
he
harboured
malice
against
her
seeing
that
she
had
foiled
him
to
the
last
she
penned
a
few
lines
asking
him
to
let
her
have
a
complete
statement
of
the
financial
results
of
her
recital
which
it
seemed
strange
that
he
had
not
sent
already
health
she
added
far
from
and
i
am
unable
either
to
go
to
town
or
to
ask
you
to
come
and
see
me
it
is
rather
doubtful
whether
i
shall
ever
again
play
in
public
in
her
own
mind
there
lingered
no
doubt
at
all
but
she
thought
it
better
not
to
be
too
abrupt
with
dymes
after
burning
all
the
letters
she
read
once
more
through
the
press
notices
of
her
performance
it
was
significant
that
the
musical
critics
whose
opinion
had
any
weight
gave
her
only
a
word
or
two
of
cautious
commendation
her
eulogists
were
writers
who
probably
knew
much
less
about
music
than
she
and
who
reported
concerts
from
the
social
point
of
view
popular
journalism
represented
her
debut
as
a
striking
success
had
she
been
able
to
use
her
opportunity
to
the
utmost
doubtless
something
of
a
the
word
then
coming
into
fashion
might
have
resulted
for
her
she
could
have
given
two
or
three
more
recitals
before
the
end
of
the
season
have
been
much
photographed
and
paragraphed
and
then
have
gone
into
the
country
spread
her
conquests
farther
this
was
felix
dymes
hope
writing
with
all
propriety
he
had
yet
allowed
it
to
be
seen
how
greatly
he
was
vexed
and
disappointed
at
her
failure
to
take
the
flood
alma
too
had
regretful
moments
but
she
fought
against
the
feeling
with
all
her
strength
today
she
all
but
found
courage
to
throw
these
newspapers
into
the
fire
it
would
be
a
final
sacrifice
a
grave
symbolic
act
and
might
bring
her
peace
yet
she
could
not
long
years
hence
would
it
not
be
a
legitimate
pride
to
show
these
things
to
her
children
a
misgiving
mingled
with
the
thought
but
her
reluctance
prevailed
she
made
up
a
parcel
wrote
upon
it
recital
may
and
locked
it
up
with
other
most
private
memorials
she
had
not
long
to
wait
for
her
answer
from
dymes
he
apologised
for
his
delay
in
the
matter
of
business
and
promised
that
a
detailed
statement
should
be
sent
to
her
in
a
very
few
days
the
unfortunate
state
of
her
health
there
alma
smiled
moved
him
to
sympathy
and
profound
regret
her
abandonment
of
a
professional
career
not
not
be
a
final
decision
something
prompted
her
to
hand
this
letter
to
harvey
took
it
for
granted
he
said
humorously
the
man
had
sent
you
a
substantial
cheque
long
ago
believe
the
balance
will
be
on
my
side
you
like
me
to
see
to
the
rest
of
the
business
for
you
do
think
that
necessary
is
it
to
her
relief
harvey
said
no
more
she
waited
for
the
promised
but
weeks
passed
by
and
it
did
not
arrive
an
explanation
of
this
readily
occurred
to
her
dymes
calculated
upon
bringing
her
to
an
interview
she
thought
of
harvey
proposal
and
wished
she
could
dare
to
accept
it
but
the
obscure
risks
were
too
great
so
months
elapsed
till
the
affair
seemed
forgotten
they
never
spoke
to
each
other
of
hugh
carnaby
or
of
sibyl
meanwhile
alma
did
not
lack
society
abbott
whom
without
change
of
feeling
she
grew
accustomed
to
see
frequently
introduced
her
to
the
langland
family
and
in
langland
she
found
a
not
uncongenial
acquaintance
this
lady
had
known
many
griefs
and
seemed
destined
to
suffer
many
more
she
had
wrinkles
on
her
face
which
should
not
have
been
there
at
but
no
one
ever
heard
her
complain
or
saw
her
look
downhearted
in
her
zeal
for
housewifery
alma
saw
much
to
admire
and
to
imitate
in
langland
she
liked
the
modesty
with
which
the
elder
lady
always
spoke
of
herself
and
was
not
displeased
at
observing
an
air
of
deference
when
the
conversation
turned
on
such
high
matters
as
literature
and
art
langland
knew
all
about
the
recital
at
prince
hall
she
knew
moreover
as
appeared
from
a
casual
remark
one
day
that
rolfe
had
skill
in
painting
told
you
that
asked
alma
with
surprise
hope
it
was
a
secret
abbott
spoke
of
your
once
she
was
delighted
with
them
praise
even
from
mary
abbott
gratified
alma
it
surprised
her
and
she
doubted
its
sincerity
but
there
was
satisfaction
in
knowing
that
her
fame
went
abroad
among
the
people
at
gunnersbury
without
admiration
she
could
not
live
and
nothing
so
severely
tested
her
resolution
to
be
content
with
the
duties
of
home
as
harvey
habit
of
taking
all
for
granted
never
remarking
upon
her
life
of
never
soothing
her
with
the
flatteries
for
which
she
hungered
she
hailed
with
delight
the
first
visit
after
several
months
from
her
friends
dora
and
gerda
leach
during
the
summer
their
father
health
had
suffered
so
severely
that
the
overwrought
man
found
himself
compelled
to
choose
between
a
long
holiday
abroad
and
the
certainty
of
complete
collapse
if
he
tried
to
pursue
his
ordinary
life
the
family
went
away
and
returned
in
november
when
it
seemed
probable
that
the
machine
known
as
leach
had
been
put
into
tolerable
working
order
for
another
year
or
so
not
having
seen
alma
since
her
recital
the
girls
overflowed
with
talk
about
it
repeating
all
the
eulogies
they
had
heard
and
adding
such
rapturous
laudation
of
their
own
that
alma
could
have
hung
upon
their
necks
in
gratitude
they
found
it
impossible
to
believe
that
she
would
no
more
play
in
public
but
when
you
are
well
they
exclaimed
would
be
a
shame
a
sin
in
writing
to
them
alma
had
put
her
decision
solely
on
the
ground
of
health
now
assuming
a
countenance
of
gentle
gravity
she
made
known
her
higher
reasons
have
felt
it
to
be
my
duty
remember
that
i
ca
consider
myself
alone
i
found
that
i
must
either
devote
myself
wholly
to
music
or
give
it
up
altogether
you
girls
ca
very
well
understand
when
one
is
a
wife
and
a
mother
i
thought
it
all
over
during
my
illness
i
had
been
neglecting
my
husband
and
hughie
and
it
was
too
bad
downright
selfishness
art
and
housekeeping
wo
go
together
i
thought
they
might
butt
found
my
mistake
of
course
it
cost
me
a
struggle
but
that
over
i
have
learnt
to
very
noble
of
you
murmured
dora
leach
never
heard
anything
so
noble
said
her
sister
alma
flushed
with
pleasure
yet
you
know
dora
pursued
have
a
duty
to
the
world
ca
help
questioning
said
gerda
you
had
a
to
sacrifice
yourself
alma
smiled
thoughtfully
ca
quite
see
it
as
i
do
when
one
has
children
must
make
a
great
difference
a
great
difference
responded
the
sisters
and
again
they
exclaimed
at
the
spectacle
of
such
noble
devotedness
by
natural
transition
the
talk
turned
to
carnaby
the
girls
spoke
of
her
compassionately
but
alma
soon
perceived
that
they
did
not
utter
all
their
thoughts
afraid
she
said
some
people
take
another
view
i
have
heard
but
one
does
care
to
repeat
such
things
dora
and
gerda
betrayed
a
lively
interest
yes
they
too
had
heard
disagreeable
gossip
what
a
shame
it
was
course
you
see
her
said
dora
alma
shook
her
head
and
seemed
a
trifle
embarrassed
do
even
know
whether
she
still
lives
there
yes
she
does
replied
miss
leach
eagerly
i
been
told
that
very
few
people
go
i
wondered
we
rather
wished
to
know
whether
did
again
alma
gently
shook
her
head
have
even
heard
from
her
i
suppose
she
has
her
reasons
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
not
quite
sure
that
my
husband
would
like
me
to
call
it
is
a
pleasant
subject
is
it
let
us
talk
of
something
else
so
when
dora
and
gerda
went
away
they
carried
with
them
the
conviction
that
carnaby
was
an
person
and
of
course
lost
no
opportunity
of
imparting
it
to
their
friends
about
a
week
before
christmas
when
the
new
servants
seemed
to
have
settled
to
their
work
and
the
house
routine
needed
less
supervision
alma
and
her
husband
dined
at
the
langlands
to
meet
a
few
quiet
people
among
the
guests
was
langland
brother
of
whom
alma
had
already
heard
and
whom
before
the
end
of
the
evening
she
came
to
regard
with
singular
interest
thistlewood
had
no
advantages
of
physique
and
little
charm
of
manner
his
long
meagre
body
never
seemed
able
to
put
itself
at
ease
sitting
or
standing
he
displayed
the
awkwardness
of
a
naturally
shy
man
who
has
not
studied
the
habits
of
society
but
his
features
in
spite
of
irregularity
and
a
complexion
resembling
the
tone
of
paper
attracted
observation
and
rewarded
it
his
eye
had
a
pleasant
twinkle
oddly
in
contrast
with
the
lines
of
painful
thought
upon
his
forehead
and
the
severity
of
strained
muscles
in
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
was
of
a
small
school
of
art
in
a
northern
county
a
post
which
he
had
held
only
for
a
twelvemonth
like
his
sister
husband
thistlewood
suffered
from
disappointed
ambition
for
he
had
aimed
at
great
things
as
a
painter
but
he
accepted
his
defeat
and
at
was
seeking
content
in
a
of
usefulness
which
promised
after
all
to
give
scope
to
his
best
faculties
not
long
ago
he
would
have
scorned
the
thought
of
becoming
a
yet
for
a
teacher
he
was
born
and
the
truth
in
dawning
upon
his
mind
had
brought
with
it
a
measure
of
consolation
a
finger
missing
from
his
left
hand
told
a
story
of
student
life
in
paris
it
was
a
quarrel
with
a
young
frenchman
about
a
girl
he
and
his
rival
happening
to
sit
opposite
to
each
other
at
a
restaurant
table
high
words
arose
between
them
and
the
frenchman
eventually
made
a
stab
at
thistlewood
hand
with
his
that
ended
the
dispute
but
the
finger
had
to
come
off
not
long
afterwards
thistlewood
accepted
an
engagement
to
go
as
artist
with
a
party
of
english
explorers
into
siberia
on
his
return
he
lingered
for
a
week
or
two
in
st
petersburg
and
there
chanced
to
meet
the
girl
who
had
cost
him
one
of
his
digits
she
like
himself
had
been
in
pursuit
of
adventures
but
whereas
the
artist
came
back
with
a
purse
the
wandering
damsel
was
at
her
last
sou
they
journeyed
together
to
london
and
for
the
next
year
or
two
thistlewood
had
the
honour
of
working
himself
almost
to
death
to
support
a
very
expensive
young
woman
who
cared
no
more
for
him
than
for
her
shoes
happily
some
richer
man
was
at
length
found
who
envied
him
his
privilege
and
therewith
ended
thistlewood
devotion
to
the
joys
of
a
bohemian
life
ever
since
his
habits
had
been
excessively
sober
perhaps
a
little
morose
but
langland
who
now
saw
him
once
a
year
thought
him
in
every
respect
improved
moreover
she
had
a
project
for
his
happiness
and
on
that
account
frequently
glanced
at
him
during
dinner
as
he
conversed
much
more
fluently
than
of
wont
with
his
neighbour
abbott
alma
sat
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
and
was
no
less
observant
than
the
hostess
of
a
peculiar
animation
on
thistlewood
dark
visage
to
be
sure
she
knew
nothing
of
him
and
it
might
be
his
habit
to
wear
that
look
when
he
talked
with
ladies
but
alma
thought
it
unlikely
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
mary
abbott
though
much
as
usual
in
manner
had
a
just
perceptible
gleam
of
countenance
beyond
what
one
was
accustomed
to
remark
in
her
moments
of
friendly
conversation
this
too
might
be
merely
the
result
of
a
little
natural
excitement
seeing
that
the
so
seldom
dined
from
home
but
in
any
case
the
proximity
of
these
two
persons
was
curiously
interesting
and
suggestive
in
the
presently
alma
had
a
pleasant
little
talk
with
mr
thistlewood
by
discreet
experiment
she
satisfied
herself
that
mrs
abbott
name
certainly
quickened
his
interest
and
having
learnt
so
much
it
was
easy
by
representing
herself
as
that
lady
old
and
intimate
friend
to
win
from
the
man
a
significant
look
of
pleasure
and
confidence
they
talked
of
art
of
landscape
and
it
appeared
that
thistlewood
was
acquainted
with
the
part
of
carnarvonshire
where
alma
had
lived
what
was
more
he
had
heard
of
her
charming
and
he
would
so
much
like
to
see
them
enemy
has
done
this
replied
alma
laughing
gaily
it
mrs
abbott
it
was
not
he
answered
with
corresponding
vivacity
then
it
must
have
been
langland
and
i
have
a
good
mind
to
put
her
to
open
shame
by
asking
you
to
come
and
see
my
wretched
daubs
nothing
would
please
him
better
declared
thistlewood
and
thereupon
he
accepted
an
invitation
to
tea
for
the
following
afternoon
alma
asked
no
one
else
she
understood
that
this
man
was
only
to
be
observed
under
favourable
conditions
by
isolating
him
she
wished
moreover
to
bring
him
into
fireside
conversation
with
harvey
and
to
remark
her
husband
demeanour
by
way
of
preparation
for
this
conjuncture
she
let
fall
in
private
chat
with
harvey
a
word
or
two
which
pointed
humorously
at
her
suspicions
concerning
thistlewood
and
mary
abbott
the
hearer
exhibited
an
incredulous
surprise
was
only
a
fancy
said
alma
smiling
rather
coldly
and
she
felt
more
desirous
than
ever
of
watching
her
husband
in
presence
unexpectedly
from
her
point
of
view
the
two
men
got
along
together
very
well
indeed
harvey
thoroughly
cordial
induced
their
guest
to
speak
of
his
work
at
the
school
of
art
and
grew
so
interested
in
it
that
the
conversation
went
on
for
a
couple
of
hours
thistlewood
had
pronounced
and
enthusiastic
ideas
on
the
subject
difficulty
is
he
exclaimed
i
ca
get
hold
of
the
children
young
enough
people
send
their
boys
and
girls
to
be
taught
drawing
as
an
accomplishment
the
feeble
old
notion
i
want
to
teach
it
as
a
most
important
part
of
elementary
education
in
fact
to
take
youngsters
straight
on
from
the
kindergarten
stage
i
tell
you
put
in
alma
our
little
boy
goes
to
mrs
abbott
and
her
eyes
were
on
both
men
at
once
should
say
you
could
have
done
better
than
send
him
there
replied
thistlewood
shuffling
his
feet
and
fidgeting
with
his
hands
abbott
is
an
admirable
teacher
she
quite
agrees
with
me
i
should
say
that
i
quite
agree
with
her
but
i
am
forgetting
rolfe
that
you
know
her
better
than
i
do
hughie
was
allowed
to
come
into
the
room
for
a
little
while
and
to
give
an
account
of
what
he
learnt
at
school
when
at
length
thistlewood
took
his
leave
it
was
with
a
promise
that
he
would
come
again
and
dine
a
few
days
hence
his
visit
at
langland
would
extend
over
another
fortnight
before
the
day
of
his
departure
northwards
alma
met
him
several
times
and
succeeded
in
establishing
almost
an
intimate
friendship
with
him
he
came
to
bid
her
goodbye
on
a
black
and
bitter
january
afternoon
when
it
happened
that
harvey
was
away
as
soon
as
he
entered
she
saw
upon
his
face
a
look
of
ill
augury
a
dejection
very
unlike
the
twinkling
hopefulness
with
which
he
had
hitherto
regarded
her
the
matter
she
asked
holding
his
hand
for
a
moment
you
like
going
back
to
work
enjoy
my
work
rolfe
as
you
know
you
are
not
like
yourself
friends
here
have
made
the
time
very
pleasant
naturally
i
like
leaving
them
he
was
a
little
abrupt
and
decidedly
showed
the
less
genial
phase
of
his
disposition
some
tea
said
alma
warm
yourself
at
the
fire
you
will
thaw
presently
thistlewood
i
suppose
like
other
unregenerate
men
you
live
in
rooms
has
that
kind
of
life
an
irresistible
charm
for
you
he
looked
at
her
with
a
frown
which
to
say
the
least
was
discouraging
it
changed
however
to
a
more
amiable
expression
as
she
handed
him
his
tea
do
you
imagine
my
income
is
mrs
rolfe
came
growlingly
from
him
have
no
idea
you
mean
i
afraid
alma
voice
fell
upon
its
gentlest
note
it
does
allow
you
to
think
of
of
any
change
not
to
allow
me
replied
the
other
have
about
two
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
ca
hope
much
more
for
a
long
time
that
exclaimed
alma
to
you
insufficient
i
should
have
thought
in
a
little
town
so
far
away
oh
you
want
to
surround
yourself
with
luxuries
do
i
beg
your
pardon
rolfe
i
meant
to
say
that
you
surely
know
me
better
his
hand
trembled
and
spilt
the
tea
which
he
had
not
yet
touched
how
can
you
suppose
that
that
anyone
he
turned
his
face
to
the
fire
the
light
of
which
made
his
eyes
glare
fiercely
forthwith
alma
launched
upon
a
spirited
remonstrance
never
even
in
the
days
just
before
her
marriage
had
she
been
so
fervid
and
eloquent
on
behalf
of
the
life
two
hundred
pounds
why
it
was
wealth
for
rational
people
she
inveighed
against
display
and
extravagance
are
looking
round
the
oh
do
apologise
it
was
quite
natural
i
confess
and
i
ashamed
of
myself
but
ask
abbott
to
tell
you
about
our
little
house
in
wales
she
came
once
to
see
us
there
we
lived
oh
so
simply
and
cheaply
and
it
was
our
happiest
time
if
only
we
could
go
back
to
it
but
the
world
has
been
too
much
for
us
people
call
it
comfort
it
means
i
assure
you
ceaseless
trouble
and
worry
who
knows
some
day
we
may
come
to
our
senses
and
shake
off
the
burden
thistlewood
smiled
we
could
all
have
cottages
among
the
mountains
he
said
a
little
provincial
town
an
example
who
would
have
a
better
right
to
defy
foolish
prejudice
a
teacher
of
the
beautiful
you
might
do
infinite
good
by
showing
how
beautifully
one
can
live
without
obeying
mere
fashion
in
a
single
point
heartily
agree
with
you
replied
thistlewood
setting
down
his
empty
cup
express
my
own
thoughts
much
better
than
i
could
myself
and
your
talk
has
done
me
good
rolfe
thank
you
for
treating
me
with
such
friendly
kindness
therewith
he
rose
and
said
goodbye
to
her
with
a
hope
that
they
might
meet
again
alma
was
vexed
that
he
would
not
stay
longer
and
take
her
more
completely
into
his
confidence
but
she
echoed
the
hope
and
smiled
upon
him
with
much
sweetness
his
behaviour
could
have
only
one
interpretation
he
had
proposed
to
mary
abbott
and
she
had
refused
him
the
longer
alma
thought
the
more
certain
she
was
and
the
more
irritated
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
continue
her
civility
to
abbott
after
this
chapter
in
these
days
rolfe
had
abandoned
even
the
pretence
of
study
he
could
not
feel
at
home
among
his
books
they
were
ranked
about
him
on
the
old
shelves
but
looked
as
uncomfortable
as
he
himself
it
seemed
a
temporary
arrangement
he
might
as
well
have
been
in
lodgings
at
pinner
after
a
twelvemonth
he
was
beginning
to
overcome
the
sense
of
strangeness
but
a
foreboding
that
he
could
not
long
remain
there
had
always
disturbed
him
here
though
every
probability
pointed
to
a
residence
of
at
least
two
or
three
years
he
scarcely
made
an
effort
to
familiarise
himself
with
the
new
surroundings
his
house
was
a
shelter
a
camp
granted
a
roof
and
drains
not
immediately
poisonous
what
need
to
take
thought
for
artificial
comforts
thousands
of
men
who
sleep
on
the
circumference
of
london
and
go
each
day
to
business
are
practically
strangers
to
the
district
nominally
their
home
ever
ready
to
strike
tent
as
convenience
bids
they
can
feel
no
interest
in
a
vicinage
which
merely
happens
to
house
them
for
the
time
being
and
as
often
as
not
they
remain
ignorant
of
the
names
of
streets
or
roads
through
which
they
pass
in
going
to
the
railway
station
harvey
was
now
very
much
in
this
case
that
he
might
not
utterly
waste
his
time
he
had
undertaken
regular
duties
under
cecil
direction
and
spent
some
hours
daily
in
westminster
bridge
road
thence
he
went
to
his
club
to
see
the
papers
and
in
returning
to
gunnersbury
he
felt
hardly
more
sense
of
vital
connection
with
this
suburb
than
with
the
murky
and
roaring
street
in
which
he
sat
at
business
by
force
of
habit
he
continued
to
read
but
only
books
from
the
circulating
library
thrown
upon
his
table
novels
popular
science
travels
biographies
each
as
it
came
to
hand
the
intellectual
disease
of
the
time
took
hold
upon
him
he
lost
the
power
of
mental
concentration
yielded
to
the
indolent
pleasure
of
desultory
there
remained
in
him
but
one
sign
of
grace
the
qualms
that
followed
on
every
evening
debauch
of
mind
the
headachey
impression
that
he
was
going
through
a
morbid
experience
which
somehow
would
work
its
own
cure
alma
seemed
quite
unaware
of
any
change
in
him
to
his
physical
comfort
she
gave
all
due
attention
anxious
lest
he
should
catch
cold
in
this
hideous
weather
and
doing
her
best
to
rule
the
house
as
he
desired
but
his
intellectual
life
was
no
concern
to
her
herein
of
course
harvey
did
but
share
the
common
lot
of
men
married
he
recognised
the
fact
and
was
too
wise
to
complain
of
it
even
in
his
own
mind
yet
it
puzzled
him
a
little
now
and
then
that
a
woman
so
intelligent
as
alma
should
in
this
respect
be
simply
on
a
level
with
the
brainless
multitude
of
her
sex
one
evening
when
they
were
together
in
his
room
he
took
down
a
volume
and
blew
the
dust
off
it
saying
as
he
did
so
not
often
disturbed
nowadays
these
solid
old
fellows
i
suppose
you
like
to
have
them
about
you
alma
replied
carelessly
as
she
glanced
at
the
shelves
yes
they
good
furniture
help
to
warm
the
room
doubt
they
do
alma
replied
always
more
comfortable
here
than
in
the
daily
he
asked
himself
whether
she
was
reconciled
to
the
loss
of
her
ambitions
and
he
could
not
feel
any
certainty
in
the
present
state
of
her
health
it
might
be
natural
for
her
to
acquiesce
in
a
humdrum
life
but
when
the
next
few
months
were
over
and
she
found
herself
once
more
able
to
move
about
as
she
pleased
would
her
mind
remain
the
same
happy
she
was
not
and
probably
nothing
in
his
power
to
do
could
make
her
so
marriage
rarely
means
happiness
either
for
man
or
woman
if
it
be
not
too
grievous
to
be
borne
one
must
thank
the
fates
and
take
courage
but
harvey
had
a
troublesome
conscience
in
acting
with
masculine
decision
with
the
authority
of
husbands
he
had
made
himself
doubly
responsible
for
any
misery
that
might
come
to
alma
through
the
conditions
of
her
life
it
might
be
that
on
the
higher
plane
of
reasoning
he
was
by
no
means
justified
there
might
have
been
found
a
middle
way
which
whilst
guarding
alma
from
obvious
dangers
still
left
her
free
to
enjoy
and
to
aspire
what
he
had
done
was
very
much
like
the
clipping
of
wings
practically
it
might
be
needful
and
of
safe
result
but
there
is
a
world
beyond
the
barnyard
for
all
that
and
how
should
he
know
with
full
assurance
whether
alma
had
not
suffered
a
grave
wrong
he
durst
not
reopen
the
discussion
with
her
he
had
taken
his
stand
and
must
hold
it
or
lose
all
marriage
is
like
life
itself
easiest
to
those
who
think
least
about
it
rolfe
knew
that
well
enough
and
would
gladly
have
acted
upon
the
knowledge
he
came
nearest
to
doing
so
at
the
times
when
hughie
was
his
companion
relieved
by
the
nursemaid
from
duties
she
had
only
borne
by
the
exertion
of
something
like
heroism
alma
once
more
drew
a
broad
line
of
demarcation
between
nursery
and
it
was
seldom
she
felt
in
a
mood
for
playing
with
the
child
and
she
had
no
taste
for
walks
but
harvey
could
not
see
too
much
of
the
little
boy
indoors
or
out
and
it
rejoiced
him
to
know
that
his
love
was
returned
in
full
measure
for
hughie
would
at
any
time
abandon
other
amusements
to
be
with
his
father
in
these
winter
months
when
by
rare
chance
there
came
a
fine
saturday
or
sunday
they
went
off
together
to
kew
or
richmond
and
found
endless
matter
for
talk
delightful
to
both
of
them
hughie
now
four
years
old
was
well
grown
and
could
walk
two
or
three
miles
without
weariness
he
had
no
colour
in
his
cheeks
and
showed
the
nervous
tendencies
which
were
to
be
expected
in
a
child
of
such
parentage
but
on
the
whole
his
health
gave
no
cause
for
uneasiness
if
anything
chanced
to
ail
him
harvey
suffered
an
excessive
disquiet
for
the
young
life
seemed
to
him
so
delicate
a
thing
that
any
touch
of
pain
might
wither
it
away
because
of
the
unutterable
anguish
in
the
thought
he
had
often
forced
himself
to
front
the
possibility
of
hughie
death
and
had
even
brought
himself
to
feel
that
in
truth
it
would
be
no
reason
for
sorrow
how
much
better
to
fall
asleep
in
playtime
and
wake
no
more
than
to
outlive
the
happiness
and
innocence
which
pass
for
ever
with
childhood
and
when
the
fear
of
life
lay
heaviest
upon
him
he
found
solace
in
remembering
that
after
no
great
lapse
of
time
he
and
those
he
loved
would
have
vanished
from
the
earth
would
be
as
though
they
had
not
been
at
all
every
pang
and
woe
awaiting
them
suffered
and
forgotten
the
best
and
the
worst
gone
by
for
ever
the
brief
flicker
of
troubled
light
quenched
in
eternal
oblivion
it
was
harvey
rolfe
best
substitute
for
the
faith
and
hope
of
the
old
world
he
liked
to
feel
the
soft
little
hand
clasping
his
own
fingers
so
big
and
coarse
in
comparison
and
happily
so
strong
for
in
the
weakness
he
felt
an
infinite
pathos
a
being
so
entirely
helpless
so
utterly
dependent
upon
others
love
standing
there
amid
a
world
of
cruelties
smiling
and
trustful
all
his
heart
went
forth
in
the
desire
to
protect
and
cherish
nothing
else
seemed
of
moment
beside
this
one
duty
which
was
also
the
purest
joy
the
word
however
sweet
to
his
ear
had
at
times
given
him
a
thrill
of
awe
spoken
by
childish
lips
did
it
mean
less
than
he
was
the
giver
of
life
and
for
that
dread
gift
must
hold
himself
responsible
a
man
in
his
agony
may
call
upon
some
unseen
power
but
the
heavens
are
mute
can
a
father
turn
away
in
heedlessness
if
the
eyes
of
his
child
reproach
him
all
pleasures
aims
hopes
that
concerned
himself
alone
shrank
to
the
idlest
trifling
when
he
realised
the
immense
debt
due
from
him
to
his
son
no
possible
sacrifice
could
discharge
it
he
marvelled
how
people
could
insist
upon
the
duty
of
children
to
parents
but
did
not
the
habit
of
thought
ally
itself
naturally
enough
with
that
strange
religion
which
under
direst
penalties
exacts
from
groaning
and
travailing
humanity
a
tribute
of
fear
and
love
to
the
imagined
author
of
its
being
with
delight
he
followed
every
step
in
the
growth
of
understanding
and
yet
it
was
not
all
pleasure
to
watch
the
mind
outgrowing
its
simplicity
intelligence
that
has
learnt
the
meaning
of
a
doubt
compares
but
sadly
with
the
charm
of
untouched
ingenuousness
that
exquisite
moment
a
moment
and
no
more
when
simplest
thought
and
simplest
word
seek
each
other
unconsciously
and
blend
in
sweetest
music
at
four
years
old
hughie
had
forgotten
his
primitive
language
the
father
regretted
many
a
pretty
turn
of
tentative
speech
which
he
was
wont
to
hear
with
love
merriment
if
a
toy
were
lost
a
little
voice
might
be
heard
saying
has
that
gone
now
and
when
it
was
found
again
is
after
a
tumble
one
day
hughie
was
cautious
in
running
shall
fall
down
and
break
myself
then
came
distinction
between
days
of
the
week
sunday
i
do
so
and
so
monday
days
i
do
something
else
he
said
you
remember
and
what
a
pity
it
seemed
when
at
last
the
dull
word
was
substituted
never
again
when
rain
was
falling
would
hughie
turn
and
plead
tell
the
sun
to
come
out
nor
when
he
saw
the
crescent
moon
in
daytime
would
he
ever
grow
troubled
and
exclaim
has
broken
it
it
was
the
rule
now
that
before
his
bedtime
seven
hughie
spent
an
hour
in
the
library
alone
with
his
father
a
golden
hour
sacred
to
memories
of
the
world
own
childhood
he
brought
with
him
the
book
that
was
his
evening
choice
grimm
or
andersen
or
aesop
already
he
knew
by
heart
a
score
of
little
poems
or
passages
of
verse
which
rolfe
disregarding
the
inept
volumes
known
as
anthologies
chose
with
utmost
care
from
his
favourite
singers
and
repeated
till
they
were
learnt
stories
from
the
odyssey
had
come
in
of
late
but
polyphemus
was
a
doubtful
experiment
hughie
dreamt
of
him
great
caution
too
was
needful
in
the
matter
of
pathos
on
hearing
for
the
first
time
andersen
tale
of
the
little
tin
soldier
hughie
burst
into
tears
and
could
scarce
be
comforted
grimm
was
safer
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
andersen
was
really
a
child
book
at
all
every
page
touched
with
the
tears
of
things
every
line
melodious
with
sadness
and
all
this
fostering
of
the
imagination
was
it
right
was
it
wise
harvey
worried
himself
with
doubts
insoluble
he
had
merely
obeyed
his
own
instincts
but
perhaps
he
would
be
doing
far
better
if
he
never
allowed
the
child
to
hear
a
or
a
line
of
poetry
why
not
amuse
his
mind
with
facts
train
him
to
the
habit
of
scientific
thought
for
all
he
knew
he
might
be
giving
the
child
a
bias
which
would
result
in
a
life
unhappiness
by
teaching
him
to
see
only
the
hard
actual
face
of
things
would
he
not
fit
him
far
more
surely
for
citizenship
of
the
world
he
would
have
liked
to
talk
about
the
child
with
mary
abbott
but
there
never
came
an
opportunity
though
it
shamed
and
angered
him
to
be
under
such
constraint
he
felt
obliged
to
avoid
any
private
meeting
with
her
alma
he
well
understood
still
nursed
the
preposterous
jealousy
which
had
been
in
her
mind
so
long
and
in
the
present
state
of
things
dubious
transitional
it
behoved
him
to
give
no
needless
occasion
of
disquiet
as
the
months
went
on
he
saw
her
spirits
fail
with
the
utmost
difficulty
she
was
persuaded
to
leave
the
house
and
for
hours
at
a
time
she
sat
as
if
in
melancholy
brooding
unwilling
to
talk
or
to
read
harvey
tried
reading
to
her
but
in
the
daytime
she
could
not
keep
her
thoughts
from
wandering
and
after
dinner
it
merely
sent
her
to
sleep
yet
she
declared
that
there
was
nothing
to
trouble
about
she
would
be
herself
again
before
long
but
one
day
the
doctor
who
was
attending
her
had
a
few
words
in
private
with
rolfe
and
told
him
that
he
had
made
an
unpleasant
discovery
mrs
rolfe
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
a
narcotic
at
first
when
the
doctor
asked
if
this
was
the
case
she
had
denied
it
but
in
the
end
he
had
elicited
a
confession
and
a
promise
that
the
dangerous
habit
should
be
relinquished
was
on
no
account
to
mention
this
to
you
and
you
must
let
it
be
seen
that
i
have
done
so
if
it
goes
on
and
i
rather
afraid
it
will
for
a
short
time
i
shall
tell
her
that
you
must
be
informed
of
it
harvey
to
whom
such
a
suspicion
had
never
occurred
waited
anxiously
for
the
doctor
further
reports
as
was
anticipated
alma
promise
held
good
only
for
a
day
or
two
and
when
again
she
confessed
her
husband
was
called
into
counsel
the
trio
went
through
a
grave
and
disagreeable
scene
on
the
doctor
departure
alma
sat
for
a
long
time
stubbornly
and
dolorously
mute
then
came
tears
and
passionate
penitence
must
think
i
a
slave
to
it
she
said
is
so
at
all
i
can
break
myself
off
it
at
once
and
i
will
why
did
you
go
on
after
the
doctor
first
warning
of
perversity
nothing
else
i
suffer
much
from
bad
nights
but
it
was
that
i
could
bear
it
i
said
to
myself
that
i
should
do
as
i
liked
she
gave
a
tearful
laugh
the
whole
truth
i
felt
just
like
a
child
when
it
determined
to
be
naughty
this
is
far
too
serious
a
matter
know
i
know
there
shall
be
an
end
of
it
i
had
my
own
way
and
satisfied
now
i
shall
be
reasonable
judging
from
results
this
seemed
to
be
a
true
explanation
from
that
day
the
doctor
saw
no
reason
for
doubt
but
harvey
had
a
most
uncomfortable
sense
of
strangeness
in
his
wife
behaviour
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
longer
he
lived
with
alma
the
less
able
he
was
to
read
her
mind
or
comprehend
her
motives
it
did
not
reassure
him
to
reflect
that
a
majority
of
husbands
are
probably
in
the
same
case
meanwhile
trouble
was
once
more
brewing
in
the
back
regions
of
the
house
the
cook
made
an
excuse
for
notice
rolfe
in
his
fury
talked
about
abandoning
the
house
and
going
with
wife
and
child
to
some
village
in
the
heart
of
france
yet
this
was
hardly
practicable
again
were
advertisements
sent
forth
again
came
the
ordeal
of
correspondence
this
time
undertaken
by
harvey
himself
for
alma
was
unequal
to
it
the
cook
whom
they
at
length
engaged
declared
with
fervour
that
the
one
thing
she
panted
for
was
downright
hard
work
she
could
abide
easy
places
and
in
fact
had
left
her
last
because
too
little
was
expected
of
her
will
stay
for
two
months
said
harvey
then
it
will
be
time
for
the
others
to
think
of
moving
oh
we
shall
get
used
to
it
at
the
end
of
march
alma
second
child
was
born
a
girl
remembering
what
she
had
endured
at
hughie
birth
rolfe
feared
that
her
trial
would
be
even
worse
this
time
but
it
did
not
prove
so
in
a
few
days
alma
was
well
on
the
way
to
recovery
but
the
child
a
lamentable
little
mortal
with
a
voice
scarce
louder
than
a
kitten
held
its
life
on
the
frailest
tenure
there
was
doubt
at
first
whether
it
could
draw
breath
at
all
and
the
nurse
never
expected
it
to
live
till
the
second
day
at
the
end
of
a
week
however
it
still
survived
and
alma
turned
to
the
poor
weakling
with
a
loving
tenderness
such
as
she
had
never
shown
for
her
to
harvey
surprise
she
gladly
took
it
to
her
breast
but
for
some
reason
this
had
presently
to
be
forbidden
and
the
mother
shed
many
tears
after
a
fortnight
things
looked
more
hopeful
nurse
and
doctor
informed
harvey
that
for
the
present
he
need
have
no
uneasiness
it
was
a
saturday
morning
and
so
cheerful
overhead
that
rolfe
used
his
liberty
to
have
a
long
stretch
towards
the
fields
hughie
who
had
no
school
today
would
gladly
have
gone
with
him
but
after
such
long
restraint
harvey
felt
the
need
of
four
miles
an
hour
and
stole
away
he
made
for
twickenham
and
hampton
court
then
by
a
long
circuit
came
round
into
richmond
park
the
star
and
garter
gave
him
a
late
luncheon
after
which
he
lit
his
cigar
and
went
idly
along
the
terrace
there
whom
should
he
meet
but
mary
abbott
she
was
seated
gazing
at
the
view
not
till
he
came
quite
near
did
harvey
recognise
her
and
until
he
stopped
she
did
not
glance
in
his
direction
thus
he
was
able
to
observe
her
for
a
moment
and
noticed
that
she
looked
anything
but
well
one
would
have
thought
her
overworked
or
oppressed
by
some
trouble
she
did
not
see
what
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
and
her
features
had
a
dreaming
tenderness
of
expression
which
made
them
more
interesting
more
nearly
beautiful
than
when
they
were
controlled
by
her
striving
will
when
harvey
paused
beside
her
she
gave
him
a
startled
smile
but
was
at
once
herself
again
you
care
for
that
he
asked
indicating
the
landscape
ca
be
enthusiastic
about
it
i
a
bit
of
ploughed
field
in
the
midlands
gives
me
more
pleasure
was
beautiful
once
before
london
breathed
upon
do
you
remember
the
view
from
cam
bodvean
indeed
i
do
the
larches
are
coming
out
now
the
gorse
shines
and
the
sea
is
blue
and
the
mountains
rise
one
behind
the
other
did
you
talk
about
it
with
thistlewood
i
found
that
he
knew
all
that
country
spoke
of
it
replied
abbott
taking
a
step
forward
interesting
man
do
you
think
harvey
glanced
at
her
remembering
the
odd
suggestion
he
had
heard
from
alma
and
in
truth
it
seemed
that
his
inquiry
caused
her
some
embarrassment
very
interesting
answered
his
companion
quietly
as
she
walked
on
had
met
him
before
always
comes
to
the
langlands
at
christmas
she
added
in
another
voice
was
glad
to
hear
from
hughie
yesterday
that
all
was
well
at
home
they
sauntered
along
the
path
harvey
described
the
walk
he
had
had
this
morning
abbott
said
that
the
bright
day
had
tempted
her
to
an
unusual
distance
she
had
come
of
course
by
train
and
must
now
think
of
turning
back
towards
the
station
me
go
so
far
with
you
said
harvey
is
your
report
of
the
boy
he
gives
you
no
trouble
i
hope
she
replied
in
detail
with
the
conscientiousness
which
always
appeared
in
her
when
speaking
of
her
work
it
was
not
the
tone
of
one
who
delights
in
teaching
there
was
no
spontaneity
no
enthusiasm
but
every
word
gave
proof
of
how
seriously
she
regarded
the
duties
she
had
undertaken
and
she
was
not
without
pride
in
her
success
the
little
school
had
grown
so
that
it
now
became
a
question
whether
she
should
decline
pupils
or
engage
an
assistant
teacher
are
resolved
to
go
on
with
the
infantry
said
rolfe
smiling
little
ones
yes
i
begin
to
feel
some
confidence
with
i
do
think
i
in
danger
of
going
far
wrong
but
i
should
have
the
least
faith
in
myself
now
with
older
of
course
i
have
minnie
wager
she
soon
be
eleven
you
know
i
do
my
best
with
her
langland
says
you
have
done
wonders
will
never
learn
much
from
books
i
feel
pretty
sure
of
that
but
she
laughed
has
a
strong
point
if
it
can
be
discovered
and
i
really
think
i
have
found
minnie
at
last
it
was
quite
by
chance
the
other
day
i
was
teaching
my
maid
to
make
pastry
and
minnie
happened
to
stand
by
afterwards
she
begged
me
to
let
try
her
hand
at
it
and
i
did
and
the
result
was
surprising
for
the
very
first
time
she
had
found
something
that
she
enjoyed
doing
she
went
to
it
with
zeal
and
learnt
in
no
time
since
then
she
has
made
tarts
and
puddings
and
cake
harvey
broke
into
laughter
it
was
an
odd
thing
that
the
employment
he
had
suggested
for
this
girl
in
his
talk
at
greystone
should
prove
to
be
her
genuine
vocation
you
think
it
as
well
to
encourage
her
said
abbott
all
manner
of
means
i
think
it
a
magnificent
discovery
i
should
give
her
the
utmost
encouragement
let
her
learn
cookery
in
all
its
branches
steadily
and
seriously
may
solve
the
problem
of
her
future
she
might
get
employment
in
one
of
the
schools
of
cookery
again
be
uneasy
about
her
cried
rolfe
delightedly
is
provided
for
she
will
grow
old
with
honour
love
obedience
troops
of
friends
a
culinary
genius
why
it
the
one
thing
the
world
is
groaning
and
clamouring
for
let
her
burn
her
sacrifice
everything
to
her
you
have
rejoiced
me
with
this
news
slenderly
endowed
on
the
side
of
humour
mary
abbott
could
not
feel
sure
whether
he
was
really
pleased
or
not
he
had
to
repeat
to
her
with
all
gravity
that
he
no
longer
felt
anxious
on
the
girl
account
my
own
part
said
mary
would
rather
see
her
a
good
cook
in
a
lady
kitchen
if
it
came
to
that
than
leading
a
foolish
life
at
some
genteel
occupation
would
any
one
who
has
and
her
brother
i
do
think
we
can
go
wrong
about
him
the
reports
from
school
are
satisfactory
they
show
that
he
loathes
everything
but
games
and
fighting
at
fifteen
they
take
him
on
a
training
i
wonder
whether
their
alive
or
dead
is
to
be
hoped
they
never
see
him
again
harvey
was
smiling
at
a
thought
which
he
did
not
communicate
say
you
would
trust
yourself
to
teach
older
children
you
mean
of
course
that
you
feel
much
the
difficulty
of
the
whole
thing
of
all
systems
of
education
and
i
dare
say
it
nothing
but
foolish
presumption
when
i
fancy
i
can
teach
babies
have
at
all
events
a
method
said
harvey
it
seems
to
be
a
very
good
one
for
the
teaching
of
children
after
they
can
read
and
write
there
seems
to
be
no
method
at
all
the
old
classical
education
was
fairly
consistent
but
it
exists
no
longer
nothing
has
taken
its
place
muddle
experiment
and
waste
of
lives
too
awful
to
think
about
we
savages
yet
in
the
matter
of
education
somebody
said
to
me
once
well
but
look
at
the
results
they
not
so
bad
great
heavens
not
so
bad
when
the
supreme
concern
of
mankind
is
to
perfect
their
instruments
of
slaughter
not
so
bad
when
the
gaol
and
the
gallows
are
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
not
so
bad
when
huge
filthy
cities
are
packed
with
multitudes
who
have
no
escape
from
toil
and
hunger
but
in
a
wretched
death
not
so
bad
when
all
but
every
life
is
one
long
blunder
the
result
of
ignorance
and
unruled
passions
abbott
showed
a
warm
assent
do
think
or
care
anything
about
education
seriously
i
suppose
it
has
less
place
in
the
thoughts
of
most
men
and
women
than
any
other
business
of
life
said
rolfe
one
is
thought
a
pedant
and
a
bore
if
one
ever
speaks
of
it
it
as
much
against
good
manners
as
to
begin
talking
about
religion
but
a
pedant
must
relieve
his
mind
sometimes
i
so
glad
i
met
you
today
i
wanted
to
hear
what
you
thought
about
the
boy
for
the
rest
of
the
way
they
talked
of
lighter
things
or
rather
rolfe
talked
and
his
companion
listened
nothing
more
difficult
than
easy
chat
between
a
person
of
abundant
leisure
and
one
whose
days
are
absorbed
in
the
earning
of
a
bare
livelihood
mary
abbott
had
very
little
matter
for
conversation
beyond
the
circle
of
her
pursuits
there
was
an
extraordinary
change
in
her
since
the
days
of
her
married
life
when
she
had
prided
herself
on
talking
well
or
even
brilliantly
harvey
could
not
help
a
feeling
of
compassion
as
she
walked
at
his
side
for
all
his
admiration
of
her
and
of
the
tasks
to
which
she
had
devoted
herself
he
would
have
liked
to
free
her
from
the
daily
mill
she
was
young
yet
and
should
taste
of
joy
before
the
years
began
to
darken
about
her
but
these
are
the
thoughts
that
must
not
be
uttered
to
show
pity
is
to
insult
a
merry
nod
to
the
friend
who
staggers
on
beneath
his
burden
and
even
at
his
last
gasp
the
friend
shall
try
to
nod
merrily
back
again
he
took
leave
of
her
at
the
station
saying
that
he
meant
to
walk
by
the
river
homeward
a
foolish
scruple
which
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
but
for
alma
jealousy
when
he
reached
his
house
at
about
four
he
felt
very
tired
it
was
a
long
time
since
he
had
walked
so
far
using
his
to
enter
he
crossed
the
hall
to
the
study
without
seeing
anyone
or
hearing
a
sound
there
was
a
letter
on
his
table
as
he
opened
it
and
began
to
read
the
door
which
he
had
left
ajar
was
pushed
softly
open
there
entered
hughie
unusually
silent
and
with
a
strange
look
in
his
bright
eyes
louie
says
that
baby
is
dead
harvey
hand
fell
he
stared
stricken
mute
i
do
want
baby
to
be
dead
do
let
baby
be
dead
the
child
voice
shook
and
tears
came
into
his
eyes
without
a
word
rolfe
hastened
from
the
room
and
up
the
stairs
as
he
reached
the
landing
a
wail
of
grief
sounded
from
somewhere
near
could
that
be
alma
voice
in
a
moment
he
had
knocked
at
her
door
he
durst
not
turn
the
handle
the
beating
of
his
heart
shook
him
in
every
limb
the
door
opened
and
the
nurse
showed
her
face
a
hurried
whisper
the
baby
had
died
two
hours
ago
in
convulsions
alma
voice
sounded
again
is
that
harvey
oh
come
come
to
me
my
little
baby
is
dead
he
sat
alone
with
her
for
an
hour
he
scarcely
knew
her
for
his
wife
so
unlike
herself
had
she
become
under
the
stress
of
passionate
woe
her
face
drawn
in
anguish
yet
illumined
as
he
had
never
seen
it
her
voice
moving
on
a
range
of
notes
which
it
had
never
sounded
the
little
body
lay
pressed
against
her
bosom
she
would
not
let
it
be
taken
from
her
consolation
was
idle
harvey
tried
to
speak
the
thought
which
was
his
first
and
last
as
he
looked
at
the
still
waxen
face
the
thought
of
thankfulness
that
this
poor
feeble
little
being
was
saved
from
life
but
he
feared
to
seem
unfeeling
alma
could
not
yet
be
comforted
the
sight
of
the
last
pitiful
struggles
had
pierced
her
to
the
heart
she
told
of
it
over
and
over
again
in
words
and
tones
profoundly
touching
the
doctor
had
been
here
and
would
return
in
the
evening
it
was
alma
now
who
had
to
be
cared
for
her
state
might
easily
become
dangerous
when
harvey
went
downstairs
again
he
met
hughie
and
his
nurse
in
the
hall
the
little
boy
ran
to
him
i
come
to
you
father
louie
says
i
must
come
yes
come
dear
in
the
library
he
sat
down
and
took
hughie
upon
his
knee
and
pressed
the
soft
little
cheek
against
his
own
without
mention
of
baby
the
child
asked
at
once
if
his
father
would
not
read
to
him
as
usual
do
think
i
can
tonight
hughie
not
father
because
baby
is
dead
and
mother
is
very
poorly
i
must
go
upstairs
again
soon
mother
going
to
be
dead
asked
the
child
with
curiosity
rather
than
fear
no
but
if
mother
went
there
she
could
fetch
baby
back
again
where
hughie
made
a
vague
upward
gesture
says
baby
is
gone
up
into
the
sky
perhaps
it
was
best
so
what
else
can
one
say
to
a
little
child
of
four
years
old
harvey
rolfe
had
no
choice
but
to
repeat
what
seemed
good
to
louie
the
nursemaid
but
he
could
refrain
from
saying
more
alma
was
in
a
fever
by
there
followed
days
and
days
of
misery
any
one
hour
of
which
as
rolfe
told
himself
outbalanced
all
the
good
and
joy
that
can
at
best
be
hoped
for
in
threescore
years
and
ten
but
alma
clung
to
life
harvey
had
thought
she
would
ask
for
her
little
son
and
expend
upon
him
the
love
called
forth
by
her
dead
baby
she
seemed
however
to
care
even
less
for
hughie
than
before
and
after
all
the
bitter
experience
had
made
little
change
in
her
chapter
since
the
removal
from
pinner
rolfe
had
forgotten
his
anxieties
with
regard
to
money
expenses
were
reduced
not
very
greatly
but
to
a
point
which
made
all
the
difference
between
just
exceeding
his
income
and
living
just
within
it
he
had
not
tried
to
economise
and
would
scarcely
have
known
how
to
begin
it
was
the
change
in
alma
mode
of
life
that
brought
about
this
fortunate
result
with
infinite
satisfaction
he
dismissed
from
his
mind
the
most
hateful
of
all
worries
it
looked
too
as
if
the
business
in
westminster
bridge
road
might
eventually
give
a
substantial
return
for
the
money
he
had
invested
in
it
through
the
winter
naturally
little
trade
was
done
but
with
springtime
things
began
to
look
brisk
and
hopeful
harvey
had
applied
himself
seriously
to
learning
the
details
of
the
business
he
was
no
longer
a
mere
but
could
hold
practical
counsel
with
his
partner
make
useful
suggestions
and
help
in
carrying
them
out
in
the
sixth
month
after
her
father
decease
rolfe
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
becoming
acquainted
with
miss
winter
morphew
took
him
one
afternoon
to
the
house
at
earl
court
where
the
widow
and
her
daughter
were
still
living
the
prospect
of
henrietta
marriage
having
made
it
not
worth
while
for
them
to
change
their
abode
in
the
interim
with
much
curiosity
with
not
a
little
mistrust
harvey
entered
the
presence
of
these
ladies
whose
names
and
circumstances
had
been
so
familiar
to
him
for
years
henrietta
proved
to
be
very
unlike
the
image
he
had
formed
of
her
anticipating
weakness
conventionality
and
some
affectation
he
was
surprised
to
meet
a
lady
of
simple
grave
manners
nervous
at
first
but
soon
perfectly
by
no
means
talkative
but
manifesting
in
every
word
a
mind
and
a
habit
of
reflection
it
astonished
him
that
such
a
man
as
cecil
morphew
should
have
discovered
his
ideal
in
henrietta
winter
it
perplexed
him
yet
more
that
cecil
attachment
should
have
been
reciprocated
winter
was
a
very
ordinary
person
rather
pretentious
rather
too
fluent
of
speech
inclined
to
fretfulness
and
probably
of
trying
temper
having
for
many
years
lived
much
beyond
his
means
in
the
manner
so
often
described
by
morphew
winter
had
left
his
family
as
good
as
unprovided
for
there
was
money
to
be
divided
between
mother
and
daughter
but
so
small
a
sum
that
it
could
not
be
regarded
as
a
source
of
income
to
the
widow
was
bequeathed
furniture
to
henrietta
a
library
of
two
thousand
volumes
the
testator
directed
that
the
sum
of
five
hundred
pounds
should
be
spent
on
a
window
of
stained
glass
concerning
which
full
particulars
were
given
to
be
set
up
in
memory
of
himself
in
the
church
he
had
been
wont
to
honour
with
his
pious
attendance
this
item
of
her
husband
will
had
so
embittered
winter
that
she
hardly
ever
spoke
of
him
if
obliged
to
do
so
it
was
with
cold
severity
that
she
uttered
his
name
immediately
she
withdrew
all
opposition
to
henrietta
marriage
with
the
man
she
had
considered
so
objectionable
she
would
not
have
been
sorry
had
her
daughter
chosen
to
be
married
with
the
least
possible
delay
as
for
the
future
of
course
she
must
live
in
her
daughter
house
together
they
must
make
what
they
could
of
their
small
capital
and
hope
that
business
would
prosper
harvey
had
been
acquainted
with
these
facts
since
winter
death
bearing
them
in
mind
as
he
talked
with
henrietta
and
exerting
his
powers
of
observation
to
the
utmost
he
still
found
himself
as
far
as
ever
from
a
definite
opinion
as
to
the
wisdom
of
the
coming
marriage
that
winter
would
be
a
great
obstacle
to
happiness
admitted
of
no
doubt
but
henrietta
herself
might
or
might
not
prove
equal
to
the
change
of
circumstances
evidently
one
of
her
characteristics
was
an
extreme
conscientiousness
it
explained
perhaps
her
long
inability
to
decide
between
the
claims
of
parents
and
lover
her
tastes
in
literature
threw
some
light
upon
the
troubles
which
had
beset
her
she
was
a
student
of
george
eliot
and
spoke
of
the
ethical
problems
with
which
that
author
is
mainly
concerned
in
a
way
suggestive
of
conversing
for
the
first
time
with
morphew
friend
and
finding
him
sufficiently
intelligent
she
might
desire
to
offer
some
indirect
explanation
of
the
course
she
had
followed
harvey
could
not
question
her
sincerity
but
she
seemed
to
him
a
trifle
morbid
it
might
be
natural
reaction
in
a
temper
such
as
hers
against
the
monstrous
egotism
by
which
her
life
had
been
subdued
and
shadowed
she
inclined
to
mystical
views
mentioned
christina
rossetti
as
one
of
her
favourites
cared
little
or
nothing
for
the
louder
interests
of
the
time
impossible
to
detect
the
colour
of
her
thoughts
with
regard
to
cecil
she
spoke
of
him
gravely
and
gently
but
without
the
least
perceptible
emotion
harvey
noticed
her
when
morphew
was
saying
goodbye
her
smile
was
sweet
and
perhaps
tender
but
even
then
she
seemed
to
be
debating
with
herself
some
point
of
conscience
perhaps
cecil
had
pressed
her
hand
rather
too
fervently
the
friends
walked
away
in
silence
along
the
street
between
monotonous
rows
of
high
sombre
houses
each
with
its
pillared
portico
which
looked
like
the
entrance
to
a
tomb
glancing
about
him
with
a
sense
of
depression
harvey
wondered
that
any
mortal
could
fix
his
pride
on
the
fact
of
residence
in
such
a
hard
cold
ugly
wilderness
she
altered
much
since
you
first
knew
her
he
asked
at
length
good
deal
answered
the
other
a
good
deal
she
used
to
laugh
sometimes
now
she
never
does
she
was
always
quiet
always
looked
at
things
seriously
but
it
was
different
you
think
her
gloomy
no
not
gloomy
it
all
natural
enough
her
life
wants
a
little
sunlight
that
all
for
the
rest
he
could
speak
with
sincere
admiration
and
cecil
heard
him
delightedly
the
choice
of
a
dwelling
was
a
most
difficult
matter
as
it
must
be
quite
a
small
house
the
remoter
suburbs
could
alone
supply
what
was
wanted
morphew
spent
every
saturday
and
sunday
in
wearisome
exploration
winter
though
in
theory
she
accepted
the
necessity
of
cheapness
shrank
from
every
practical
suggestion
declaring
it
impossible
to
live
in
such
places
as
cecil
requested
her
to
look
at
she
had
an
ideal
of
the
little
house
and
was
as
likely
to
discover
it
in
london
suburbs
as
to
become
possessed
once
more
of
the
considerable
fortune
which
she
and
her
husband
had
squandered
in
mean
extravagance
morphew
had
already
come
to
the
conclusion
and
henrietta
agreed
with
him
that
their
future
home
must
be
chosen
without
regard
to
winter
impracticable
ideas
and
the
sooner
the
better
in
her
own
interests
for
it
was
plain
that
so
long
as
she
continued
in
the
old
house
she
would
thoughtlessly
waste
her
means
the
end
of
the
twelvemonth
at
latest
must
see
them
all
in
their
new
home
but
meanwhile
fate
was
preparing
a
new
trial
for
conscience
on
a
saturday
afternoon
when
the
crisis
of
alma
illness
was
over
harvey
received
a
telegram
summoning
him
to
westminster
bridge
road
come
if
you
possibly
can
or
i
must
come
to
you
only
yesterday
he
had
been
with
morphew
for
a
couple
of
hours
and
all
seemed
well
cecil
thought
he
had
found
the
house
that
would
suit
him
he
was
in
jubilant
spirits
laughing
singing
more
boylike
than
ever
suspecting
new
obstructiveness
on
the
part
of
winter
harvey
went
to
town
in
an
impatient
mood
he
found
the
shop
closed
as
usual
at
this
hour
on
saturday
and
rang
the
bell
morphew
himself
replied
with
a
countenance
which
made
known
forthwith
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened
eyes
red
and
swollen
cheeks
puffy
colourless
smeared
well
cecil
clutched
at
his
hand
and
drew
him
in
they
went
upstairs
to
the
office
where
all
was
quiet
rolfe
if
i
had
had
you
to
send
for
i
should
have
been
dead
by
now
there
poison
enough
in
this
place
it
has
tempted
me
fearfully
what
is
it
asked
the
other
in
a
not
very
sympathetic
voice
his
own
troubles
of
the
past
month
made
mere
seem
artificial
i
shall
have
to
tell
you
what
i
wanted
to
tell
you
long
ago
if
i
had
most
likely
this
would
never
have
it
all
over
with
me
rolfe
i
wish
to
god
you
had
let
me
die
in
that
hotel
at
she
has
been
told
something
about
me
and
there
an
end
of
everything
she
sent
for
me
this
morning
i
never
thought
she
could
be
so
the
kind
of
thing
that
a
man
thinks
nothing
of
and
herself
the
cause
of
it
if
only
i
had
dared
to
tell
her
so
old
story
i
suppose
said
harvey
other
woman
was
very
near
telling
you
that
day
you
came
to
my
beastly
garret
in
chelsea
do
you
remember
it
was
the
worst
time
with
me
then
except
when
you
found
me
in
brussels
i
been
gambling
again
you
knew
that
i
wanted
money
for
something
i
felt
ashamed
to
speak
you
know
the
awful
misery
i
used
to
suffer
about
henrietta
i
was
often
enough
nearly
mad
with
what
is
one
to
call
it
why
is
there
a
decent
name
for
the
agony
men
go
through
at
that
age
i
simply
could
live
alone
any
longer
i
could
and
only
a
fool
and
a
hypocrite
would
pretend
to
blame
me
a
man
that
is
women
seem
to
be
made
oh
there
nothing
to
tell
the
same
thing
happens
a
hundred
times
every
day
in
london
a
girl
wandering
about
in
the
park
quarrel
at
home
all
the
rest
of
it
a
good
many
lies
on
her
side
a
good
deal
of
selfishness
on
mine
i
happened
to
have
money
just
then
and
just
when
i
had
money
about
the
time
you
met
me
a
child
was
born
she
said
it
was
mine
anyway
i
had
to
be
responsible
of
course
i
had
long
ago
repented
of
behaving
so
badly
to
henrietta
but
no
woman
can
understand
and
it
impossible
to
explain
to
them
you
a
beast
and
a
villain
and
there
an
end
of
it
how
has
this
become
known
to
miss
winter
harvey
inquired
seeing
that
morphew
lost
himself
in
gloom
might
almost
guess
it
these
things
always
happen
in
the
same
way
you
heard
me
speak
of
a
fellow
called
driffel
no
i
thought
i
might
have
mentioned
him
he
got
to
know
the
girl
he
and
i
were
at
a
one
night
and
she
met
us
and
i
heard
soon
after
that
she
was
living
with
him
it
did
last
long
she
got
ill
and
wrote
to
me
from
westminster
hospital
and
i
was
foolish
enough
to
give
her
money
again
off
and
on
up
to
only
a
few
months
ago
she
talked
about
living
a
respectable
life
and
so
on
and
i
could
refuse
to
help
her
but
i
found
out
it
was
all
humbug
and
of
course
i
stopped
then
she
began
to
hunt
me
out
of
spite
and
she
heard
from
someone
driffel
as
likely
as
not
all
about
henrietta
and
yesterday
henrietta
had
a
letter
from
her
this
morning
i
was
sent
for
to
explain
myself
one
time
then
you
had
lost
sight
of
her
altogether
has
always
had
money
from
me
more
or
less
regularly
except
at
the
time
that
driffel
kept
her
but
there
has
been
nothing
else
between
us
since
that
first
year
i
kept
up
payments
on
account
of
the
child
and
she
was
cheating
me
in
that
too
of
course
she
put
out
the
baby
to
nurse
and
i
understood
it
lived
on
but
the
truth
was
it
died
after
a
month
or
two
starved
to
death
no
doubt
i
only
learnt
that
by
taking
a
good
deal
of
trouble
when
she
was
with
driffel
to
death
at
a
month
or
two
old
murmured
rolfe
best
thing
for
it
no
doubt
worse
than
anything
i
have
done
said
morphew
miserably
think
more
of
it
now
than
i
did
at
the
time
a
cruel
vile
thing
you
told
miss
winter
everything
that
can
be
spoken
about
the
plain
truth
of
the
story
the
letter
was
a
lie
from
beginning
to
end
of
course
it
made
me
out
a
heartless
scoundrel
i
had
been
the
ruin
of
the
girl
a
helpless
innocent
and
now
after
all
these
years
wanted
to
cut
her
adrift
not
caring
what
became
of
her
my
defence
seemed
to
henrietta
no
defence
at
all
the
fact
that
there
had
been
such
an
episode
in
my
life
was
quite
sufficient
everything
must
be
at
an
end
between
us
at
once
and
for
ever
she
not
live
with
me
knowing
this
no
one
should
learn
the
cause
not
even
her
mother
but
i
must
never
see
her
again
and
so
i
came
away
meaning
to
end
my
life
it
was
cowardice
that
prevented
me
only
the
thought
that
would
be
mixed
up
in
it
and
suffer
more
than
i
had
made
her
already
voice
and
look
constrained
harvey
to
believe
this
he
spoke
more
sympathetically
better
that
it
happened
before
than
after
tried
to
think
that
but
i
ca
afterwards
i
could
have
made
her
believe
me
and
forgive
me
seems
to
me
more
than
doubtful
why
should
it
have
happened
at
all
cried
cecil
in
the
tone
of
despairing
bitterness
i
deserve
it
have
i
behaved
better
more
kindly
than
most
men
would
have
done
is
it
just
because
i
was
too
that
this
has
come
on
me
myself
readily
take
that
view
answered
rolfe
i
can
perfectly
understand
why
miss
winter
does
can
i
so
can
i
groaned
cecil
in
her
nature
and
do
you
suppose
i
have
cursed
myself
for
deceiving
her
the
thought
has
made
me
miserable
often
enough
i
never
dreamt
she
would
get
to
know
of
it
but
it
weighed
upon
me
all
the
same
yet
who
was
the
cause
of
it
really
and
truly
i
glad
i
could
keep
myself
from
saying
all
i
thought
she
would
have
understood
i
should
only
have
looked
more
brutal
in
her
eyes
but
if
she
had
married
me
when
she
might
have
done
was
the
wrong
that
led
to
everything
else
harvey
nodded
and
muttered
one
and
twenty
she
might
have
taken
her
own
way
i
was
a
penniless
adventurer
my
name
is
as
good
as
hers
we
could
have
lived
well
enough
on
my
income
until
i
found
a
way
of
increasing
it
as
i
should
have
done
girls
do
know
what
they
are
doing
when
they
make
men
wait
year
after
year
no
one
can
tell
them
but
i
begged
i
prayed
to
her
i
said
all
i
dared
it
was
her
cursed
father
and
mother
if
i
had
had
three
thousand
instead
of
three
hundred
a
year
they
would
have
rushed
her
into
marriage
no
we
must
have
a
big
house
like
their
own
and
a
troop
of
thieving
servants
or
we
were
eternally
disgraced
i
got
the
money
did
matter
so
long
as
i
got
it
and
she
had
courage
she
thought
it
wrong
to
defy
them
as
if
the
wrong
was
in
giving
way
to
such
a
base
superstition
i
believe
she
has
seen
that
since
her
father
death
and
now
he
broke
down
shaking
and
choking
in
an
agony
of
sobs
harvey
could
only
lay
a
kind
hand
upon
him
there
was
no
verbal
comfort
to
offer
presently
cecil
talked
on
again
and
so
they
sat
together
as
twilight
passed
into
darkness
rolfe
would
gladly
have
taken
the
poor
fellow
home
with
him
out
of
solitude
with
its
miseries
and
dangers
but
cecil
refused
eventually
they
walked
westward
for
a
few
miles
then
morphew
with
a
promise
to
see
his
friend
next
day
turned
back
into
the
crowd
chapter
alma
was
walking
on
the
at
penzance
glad
to
be
quite
alone
yet
at
a
loss
how
to
spend
the
time
rolfe
had
sailed
for
scilly
and
would
be
absent
for
two
or
three
days
frothingham
with
hughie
for
companion
was
driving
to
marazion
why
alma
asked
herself
had
she
wished
to
be
left
alone
this
morning
some
thought
had
glimmered
vaguely
in
her
restless
mind
she
could
not
recover
it
the
little
shop
window
set
out
with
objects
carved
in
serpentine
held
her
for
a
moment
but
remembering
how
often
she
had
paused
here
lately
she
felt
ashamed
and
walked
on
presently
there
moved
towards
her
a
lady
in
a
a
lady
who
had
once
been
beautiful
but
now
though
scarcely
looked
gaunt
and
haggard
from
some
long
illness
the
invalid
held
open
a
newspaper
and
alma
in
passing
saw
that
it
was
at
once
her
step
quickened
for
she
had
remembered
the
desire
which
touched
her
an
hour
ago
she
walked
to
the
railway
station
surveyed
the
papers
on
the
bookstall
and
bought
three
papers
which
would
tell
her
what
was
going
on
in
society
with
these
in
hand
she
found
a
quiet
spot
sheltered
from
the
august
sun
where
she
could
sit
and
read
she
read
eagerly
enviously
and
before
long
her
eye
fell
upon
a
paragraph
in
which
was
a
name
she
knew
lady
isobel
barker
in
her
lovely
retreat
at
boscombe
was
entertaining
a
large
in
the
list
appeared
hugh
carnaby
unmistakable
hugh
carnaby
who
lady
isobel
might
be
alma
had
no
idea
nor
were
any
of
the
other
guests
known
to
her
but
the
names
of
all
seemed
to
roll
upon
the
tongue
of
the
announcing
footman
she
had
a
vision
of
sibyl
in
that
august
company
sibyl
coldly
beautiful
admirably
sage
with
perhaps
ever
so
little
of
the
air
of
a
martyr
to
heighten
her
impressiveness
when
she
could
command
herself
she
glanced
hurriedly
through
column
after
column
of
all
the
papers
seeking
for
that
name
again
in
one
an
illustrated
publication
she
came
upon
a
couple
of
small
portraits
side
by
side
surely
she
recognised
that
face
the
bold
man
with
his
pretentious
smile
but
the
girl
no
a
young
and
very
pretty
girl
smirking
a
little
with
feathery
hair
which
faded
off
into
an
aureole
the
text
was
illuminating
am
able
to
announce
wrote
ego
i
think
i
shall
be
one
of
the
first
to
do
so
that
the
brilliant
composer
felix
dymes
will
shortly
vanish
from
the
gay
if
naughty
world
of
bachelorhood
i
learn
on
excellent
authority
that
dymes
has
quite
recently
become
engaged
to
miss
lettice
almond
a
very
charming
young
lady
whose
many
gifts
especially
musical
have
as
yet
been
known
only
to
a
comparatively
small
circle
and
for
the
delightful
reason
that
she
is
still
only
eighteen
miss
almond
is
the
daughter
of
haliburton
almond
senior
partner
in
the
old
and
firm
of
almond
brothers
the
manufacturers
of
fireworks
she
is
an
only
daughter
and
though
she
has
two
brothers
i
may
add
i
trust
without
indiscretion
that
the
title
of
heiress
may
be
fittingly
applied
to
her
the
marriage
may
take
place
in
november
and
will
doubtless
be
a
brilliant
as
well
as
a
most
interesting
affair
dymes
new
opera
is
not
likely
to
be
ready
till
next
year
but
some
who
have
been
privileged
to
hear
the
parts
already
composed
declare
that
it
will
surpass
even
blue
roses
in
the
charm
of
sweet
yet
vivacious
melody
when
she
had
read
and
mused
for
more
than
an
hour
alma
tore
out
the
two
passages
that
had
a
personal
interest
for
her
and
put
them
in
her
purse
the
papers
she
left
lying
for
anyone
who
chose
to
pick
them
up
a
fortnight
later
she
was
back
at
gunnersbury
where
indeed
she
would
have
been
content
to
stay
all
through
the
summer
had
not
harvey
and
the
doctor
insisted
on
her
leaving
home
all
sorts
of
holidays
had
been
proposed
but
nothing
of
the
kind
attracted
her
she
declared
that
she
was
quite
well
and
that
she
preferred
home
to
anywhere
else
she
had
got
used
to
it
and
did
not
wish
to
be
unsettled
six
weeks
at
penzance
simply
wearied
her
she
brightened
wonderfully
on
the
day
of
return
harvey
always
anxious
tried
to
believe
that
the
great
sorrow
through
which
she
had
passed
was
effecting
only
a
natural
change
subduing
her
troublesome
mutability
of
temper
and
leading
her
to
find
solace
in
domestic
quietude
on
the
third
day
after
her
return
she
had
lunched
alone
and
was
sitting
in
the
library
her
dress
more
elaborate
than
usual
and
the
frequent
glances
which
she
cast
at
the
clock
denoted
expectation
of
some
arrival
hearing
a
knock
at
the
front
door
she
rose
and
waited
nervously
dymes
is
in
the
mum
she
joined
him
dymes
with
wonted
frankness
not
to
say
impudence
inspected
her
from
head
to
foot
and
did
not
try
to
conceal
surprise
was
awfully
glad
to
get
your
note
as
i
told
you
i
called
here
about
a
month
ago
and
i
should
have
called
again
i
did
care
to
write
until
i
heard
from
you
you
been
ill
i
can
see
i
heard
about
it
awfully
sorry
alma
saw
that
he
intended
respectful
behaviour
the
fact
of
being
in
her
own
house
was
of
course
a
protection
but
dymes
she
quite
understood
had
altered
in
mind
towards
her
she
treated
him
distantly
yet
without
a
hint
of
unfriendliness
began
to
wonder
whether
i
had
missed
a
letter
of
yours
it
some
time
since
you
promised
to
write
on
business
fact
is
he
replied
kept
putting
it
off
hoping
to
see
you
and
it
wonderful
how
time
slips
by
i
can
hardly
believe
that
more
than
a
year
since
your
recital
how
splendidly
it
came
off
if
only
you
could
have
followed
it
up
but
we
wo
talk
about
that
he
paused
for
any
remark
she
might
wish
to
make
alma
dreamy
for
a
moment
recovered
herself
and
asked
in
a
disinterested
tone
paid
all
expenses
i
suppose
not
quite
quite
i
understood
from
you
that
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
thought
said
dymes
as
he
bent
forward
familiarly
my
silence
would
let
you
know
how
matters
stood
if
there
had
been
anything
due
to
you
of
course
i
should
have
sent
a
cheque
we
did
very
well
indeed
remarkably
well
but
the
advertising
expenses
were
very
heavy
he
took
a
paper
from
his
pocket
is
the
detailed
account
i
should
have
spent
so
much
if
i
had
regarded
it
as
an
investment
you
had
to
be
boomed
you
know
floated
and
i
flatter
myself
i
did
it
pretty
well
but
of
course
as
things
turned
out
alma
glanced
over
the
paper
the
items
astonished
her
mean
to
say
then
that
i
am
in
your
debt
for
a
hundred
and
thirty
pounds
be
hanged
cried
dymes
magnanimously
all
done
with
long
ago
i
only
wanted
to
explain
how
things
were
alma
reddened
she
was
trying
to
remember
the
state
of
her
banking
account
and
felt
sure
that
at
this
moment
considerably
less
than
a
hundred
pounds
stood
to
her
credit
but
she
rose
promptly
course
i
shall
give
you
a
cheque
do
treat
me
like
a
regular
agent
rolfe
surely
you
know
me
better
than
that
i
undertook
it
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
you
do
suppose
i
can
accept
a
present
of
money
from
you
mr
dymes
it
just
as
you
like
of
course
but
do
make
me
take
it
now
as
if
i
looked
in
with
my
little
bill
send
the
cheque
if
you
must
but
what
i
really
came
for
when
i
called
a
few
weeks
ago
was
something
else
quite
a
different
thing
and
a
good
deal
more
important
just
sit
down
again
if
you
can
spare
me
a
few
minutes
with
face
averted
alma
sank
back
into
her
chair
harvey
would
give
her
the
money
without
a
word
but
she
dreaded
the
necessity
of
asking
him
for
it
so
disturbed
were
her
thoughts
that
she
did
not
notice
how
oddly
dymes
was
regarding
her
and
his
next
words
sounded
meaningless
can
we
talk
here
mean
he
lowered
his
voice
we
safe
from
interruption
all
right
do
look
frightened
the
fact
is
i
want
to
speak
of
something
rather
awkward
but
it
something
you
ought
to
know
about
if
you
do
already
am
quite
at
leisure
she
replied
adding
with
a
nervous
movement
of
the
head
will
be
no
interruption
want
to
ask
you
then
have
you
seen
strangeways
lately
mrs
carnaby
understand
you
broken
with
them
altogether
you
do
want
anything
more
to
do
with
that
lot
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
them
alma
replied
steadying
her
voice
to
a
cold
dignity
i
think
you
quite
right
now
look
here
you
heard
i
dare
say
that
i
going
to
be
married
well
i
not
the
kind
of
fellow
to
talk
sentiment
as
you
know
but
i
had
fair
luck
in
life
and
i
feel
pretty
pleased
with
myself
and
if
i
can
do
anybody
a
friendly
turn
anybody
that
deserves
it
i
all
there
i
want
you
just
to
think
of
me
as
a
friend
and
nothing
else
you
rather
set
against
me
i
know
but
try
and
forget
all
about
that
things
are
changed
after
all
you
know
i
one
of
the
men
that
people
talk
about
my
name
has
got
into
the
directories
of
talent
as
somebody
calls
them
and
i
have
a
good
deal
at
stake
it
wo
do
for
me
to
go
fooling
about
any
more
all
i
mean
is
that
you
can
trust
me
down
to
the
ground
and
nobody
i
would
be
better
pleased
to
help
in
a
friendly
way
than
you
mrs
rolfe
alma
was
gazing
at
him
in
surprise
mingled
with
apprehension
say
what
you
mean
i
do
see
how
you
can
possibly
do
me
any
service
i
have
given
up
all
thought
of
a
professional
career
know
you
have
i
sorry
for
it
but
it
is
that
i
want
to
talk
about
you
do
see
carnaby
but
i
suppose
you
hear
of
her
now
and
then
rarely
know
that
she
has
been
taken
up
by
lady
isobel
barker
is
lady
isobel
barker
she
a
daughter
of
the
earl
of
bournemouth
and
she
married
a
fellow
on
the
stock
exchange
there
are
all
sorts
of
amusing
stories
about
her
i
do
mean
anything
shady
just
the
opposite
she
did
a
good
deal
of
slumming
at
the
time
when
it
was
fashionable
and
started
a
home
for
women
of
a
certain
kind
all
that
sort
of
thing
barker
is
by
way
of
being
a
millionaire
and
they
live
in
great
style
have
royalties
down
at
boscombe
and
so
on
well
carnaby
has
got
hold
of
her
i
do
know
how
she
managed
it
just
after
that
affair
it
looked
as
if
she
would
have
a
bad
time
people
cut
her
you
know
all
about
that
i
do
you
mean
that
they
thought
so
they
did
think
he
nodded
and
smiled
was
all
the
talk
at
the
clubs
and
no
doubt
in
the
boudoirs
i
was
a
friend
of
hers
you
know
i
met
her
now
and
then
that
was
all
so
i
did
quite
know
what
to
think
but
it
looked
it
alma
avoided
his
glance
and
said
nothing
should
wonder
pursued
dymes
she
went
to
lady
isobel
and
talked
about
her
hard
case
and
just
asked
for
help
at
all
events
last
may
we
began
to
hear
of
carnaby
again
women
who
wanted
to
be
thought
smart
had
quite
altered
their
tone
about
her
men
laughed
but
some
of
them
began
to
admit
that
the
case
was
doubtful
at
all
events
lady
isobel
was
on
her
side
and
that
meant
a
good
deal
she
went
about
in
society
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
no
that
would
have
been
bad
taste
considering
where
her
husband
was
she
was
seen
much
only
talked
about
she
a
clever
woman
and
by
the
time
carnaby
let
loose
she
have
played
the
game
so
well
that
things
will
be
made
pretty
soft
for
him
i
told
he
a
bit
of
a
sportsman
and
so
on
all
he
has
to
do
is
to
knock
up
a
book
of
travels
and
it
go
like
wildfire
alma
had
pulled
to
pieces
a
tassel
on
her
chair
has
all
this
to
do
with
me
she
asked
abruptly
coming
to
that
you
do
know
anything
about
strangeways
either
well
there
be
a
doubt
about
carnaby
but
none
about
she
just
about
as
bad
as
they
make
i
could
tell
you
things
but
i
wo
what
i
want
to
know
is
did
you
quarrel
with
her
why
should
we
have
quarrelled
what
had
i
to
do
with
her
about
redgrave
asked
dymes
pushing
his
head
forward
and
speaking
confidentially
do
you
mean
harm
i
assure
you
all
the
other
way
i
strangeways
and
i
had
a
good
deal
of
talk
with
her
lately
and
i
could
help
suspecting
you
had
a
reason
of
your
own
for
getting
clear
of
her
let
me
tell
you
first
of
all
that
she
left
her
house
in
porchester
terrace
my
belief
is
that
she
and
her
husband
have
a
note
between
them
and
the
queer
thing
is
that
this
has
come
about
since
redgrave
death
he
paused
to
give
his
words
their
full
significance
alma
no
longer
disguising
her
interest
faced
him
with
searching
eyes
a
bad
un
pursued
the
musician
i
should
care
to
tell
all
i
think
about
her
life
for
the
last
few
years
i
seen
a
good
deal
of
life
myself
you
know
and
i
do
pretend
to
be
squeamish
but
i
draw
a
line
for
women
strangeways
goes
a
good
bit
beyond
it
as
i
know
for
certain
is
it
to
said
alma
with
tremulous
impatience
this
much
she
is
doing
her
best
to
harm
you
and
in
a
devilish
artful
way
she
tries
to
make
believe
and
it
certain
she
says
the
same
to
others
that
what
happened
at
wimbledon
was
result
of
a
plot
between
you
and
redgrave
alma
stared
at
him
her
parted
lips
quivering
with
an
abortive
laugh
you
understand
she
says
that
you
were
furiously
jealous
of
mrs
carnaby
and
did
care
what
you
did
to
ruin
her
that
you
put
redgrave
housekeeper
up
to
telling
carnaby
lies
about
his
wife
long
has
she
been
saying
this
heard
it
for
the
first
time
about
two
months
ago
but
let
me
go
on
the
interesting
thing
is
that
at
the
time
of
the
trial
and
after
it
she
was
all
the
other
way
she
as
good
as
told
me
that
she
had
proof
against
carnaby
i
fancy
she
told
lots
of
people
the
same
she
talked
as
if
she
hated
the
woman
but
now
that
carnaby
is
looking
up
you
see
she
going
to
play
carnaby
game
at
your
expense
what
i
should
like
to
know
is
whether
they
done
it
together
ca
be
much
doubt
of
that
said
alma
between
her
teeth
do
know
rejoined
the
other
cautiously
you
reason
to
think
that
carnaby
would
like
to
injure
you
quite
sure
she
would
do
so
if
it
benefited
herself
yet
you
were
fast
friends
not
long
ago
were
you
asked
dymes
with
a
look
of
genuine
curiosity
do
always
know
people
as
well
as
we
think
where
is
that
woman
living
now
i
mean
mrs
strangeways
more
than
i
can
tell
you
she
is
or
is
supposed
to
be
out
of
town
i
saw
her
last
just
before
she
left
her
house
the
other
in
town
carnaby
i
do
know
i
was
going
to
say
dymes
pursued
the
story
has
been
telling
seems
to
me
very
clumsy
and
why
i
do
think
the
other
has
any
hand
in
it
she
seemed
to
have
forgotten
that
redgrave
housekeeper
who
was
wanted
by
the
police
was
likely
to
put
herself
in
carnaby
way
the
man
she
had
robbed
i
pointed
that
out
but
she
only
laughed
we
not
bound
to
believe
she
said
all
that
carnaby
said
on
his
trial
are
not
alma
remarked
with
a
hard
smile
think
he
dressed
things
up
a
bit
think
answered
alma
he
may
have
known
more
than
he
told
my
idea
too
but
never
mind
whatever
the
truth
may
be
that
woman
is
doing
you
a
serious
injury
i
felt
you
ought
to
know
about
it
people
have
talked
about
you
a
good
deal
wondering
why
on
earth
you
dropped
out
of
sight
so
suddenly
after
that
splendid
start
and
it
was
only
natural
they
should
connect
your
name
with
the
carnaby
affair
knowing
as
so
many
did
that
you
were
a
friend
of
theirs
and
of
redgrave
too
knew
redgrave
said
alma
i
was
no
friend
of
his
dymes
peered
at
her
he
interest
himself
a
good
deal
in
your
business
more
than
many
other
people
i
very
glad
to
hear
that
said
dymes
looking
about
the
room
tell
you
honestly
that
whenever
i
have
a
chance
of
speaking
up
for
you
i
shall
do
it
am
very
much
obliged
but
i
really
do
think
it
matters
what
is
said
of
me
i
am
not
likely
ever
to
meet
the
people
who
talk
about
such
things
she
said
it
in
so
convincing
a
tone
that
dymes
looked
at
her
gravely
never
know
any
one
change
so
much
he
observed
it
really
your
health
no
other
reason
for
giving
up
such
magnificent
chances
course
i
have
my
reasons
they
concern
nobody
but
myself
might
give
a
guess
i
dare
say
well
you
the
best
judge
and
we
wo
say
any
more
about
that
but
look
here
about
and
her
scandal
i
feel
sure
as
i
said
that
she
toadying
to
carnaby
and
expects
to
make
her
gain
out
of
it
somehow
her
husband
a
loafing
gambling
fellow
and
i
should
wonder
if
he
gave
her
the
skip
most
likely
she
have
to
live
by
her
wits
and
we
know
what
that
means
in
a
woman
of
her
kind
she
be
more
or
less
dangerous
to
everybody
that
worth
blackmailing
think
she
had
she
was
dependent
in
some
way
upon
mr
redgrave
asked
alma
in
an
undertone
heard
so
shall
i
tell
you
what
a
woman
said
who
is
very
likely
to
know
long
ago
in
the
time
of
her
first
marriage
she
got
hold
of
something
about
him
that
would
have
made
a
furious
scandal
and
he
had
to
pay
for
her
silence
all
gossip
but
there
generally
a
foundation
for
that
kind
of
thing
if
it
true
no
doubt
she
has
been
at
his
relatives
since
his
death
it
does
look
as
if
they
were
disposed
to
be
bled
perhaps
they
turned
the
tables
on
her
she
has
looked
sour
and
disappointed
enough
for
a
long
time
was
just
thinking
said
alma
with
an
air
of
serious
deliberation
it
would
be
worth
while
for
to
turn
the
tables
on
her
and
prosecute
her
for
slander
you
take
my
advice
you
keep
out
of
that
replied
the
other
with
emphasis
another
thing
has
occurred
to
me
i
see
your
opinion
of
carnaby
and
no
doubt
you
have
good
reason
for
it
now
would
it
be
possible
to
frighten
her
have
you
he
peered
more
keenly
evidence
that
would
make
things
awkward
for
mrs
carnaby
alma
kept
close
lips
breathing
rapidly
you
pursued
the
other
give
her
a
hint
that
mrs
strangeways
had
better
stop
talking
you
find
it
effectual
no
doubt
he
watched
her
and
tried
to
interpret
the
passion
in
her
eyes
i
think
it
necessary
said
alma
and
seemed
to
check
herself
need
to
say
any
more
i
wished
to
put
you
on
your
guard
all
we
known
each
other
for
a
longish
time
and
i
often
enough
felt
sorry
that
something
did
come
off
you
remember
when
no
good
talking
about
that
but
i
shall
always
be
glad
if
i
can
be
a
friend
to
you
and
i
say
do
think
any
more
about
that
cheque
there
a
good
girl
the
note
of
familiar
patronage
was
more
than
distasteful
to
alma
shall
of
course
send
it
she
replied
curtly
you
please
would
you
like
to
hear
a
bit
from
my
new
opera
it
is
every
one
gets
the
chance
you
know
quite
in
his
old
way
he
seated
himself
at
the
piano
and
ran
lightly
through
a
few
choice
exacting
praise
and
showing
himself
vexed
because
it
was
not
fervent
in
spite
of
her
wandering
thoughts
alma
felt
the
seductiveness
of
these
melodies
their
originality
their
grace
and
once
more
she
wondered
at
their
coming
from
the
mind
of
such
a
man
pretty
exclaimed
the
composer
scornfully
a
good
deal
more
than
that
and
you
know
it
i
do
care
there
somebody
else
feels
deuced
proud
of
me
and
good
reason
too
well
there
are
disadvantages
in
associating
with
people
whose
every
word
as
likely
as
not
may
be
an
insidious
falsehood
thinking
over
what
she
had
heard
from
dymes
alma
was
inclined
to
believe
him
on
the
other
hand
she
knew
it
to
be
quite
possible
that
he
sought
her
with
some
interested
motive
the
wise
thing
she
knew
would
be
to
disregard
his
reports
and
hold
aloof
from
the
world
in
which
they
originated
but
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
see
strangeways
there
might
be
someone
at
the
house
in
porchester
terrace
who
could
help
her
to
discover
its
late
tenant
however
dangerous
the
woman
wiles
and
slanders
an
interview
with
her
could
do
no
harm
and
might
set
at
rest
a
curiosity
long
lurking
now
feverishly
stimulated
with
regard
to
sibyl
there
could
be
little
doubt
that
dymes
had
heard
or
conjectured
the
truth
sibyl
was
clever
enough
to
make
her
perilous
reverse
a
for
new
social
conquests
were
there
but
a
hope
of
confronting
her
with
some
fatal
disclosure
and
dragging
her
down
down
that
cheque
must
be
sent
she
would
show
harvey
the
account
this
evening
and
have
done
with
the
unpleasantness
of
it
probably
he
remembered
from
time
to
time
that
she
had
never
told
him
how
her
business
with
dymes
was
settled
no
more
duplicity
the
money
would
be
paid
and
therewith
finis
to
that
dragging
chapter
of
her
life
harvey
came
home
at
five
and
as
usual
had
tea
with
her
of
late
he
had
been
uneasy
about
cecil
morphew
whose
story
alma
knew
today
he
spoke
more
hopefully
i
bring
him
here
tomorrow
and
make
him
stay
over
sunday
sunday
is
his
bad
day
and
no
wonder
if
there
were
a
licensed
in
london
they
do
a
very
fair
trade
on
sundays
are
the
said
alma
but
morphew
does
incline
that
way
the
fellow
has
delicate
instincts
and
suffers
all
the
more
so
the
world
is
made
i
ca
help
hoping
it
may
come
right
for
him
yet
i
have
a
suspicion
that
winter
may
be
on
his
side
if
so
it
only
a
question
of
time
i
keep
at
him
like
a
he
to
work
whilst
i
there
and
he
takes
it
very
but
you
must
give
him
music
alma
he
says
he
ca
stand
it
much
obliged
to
him
she
answered
laughing
understand
well
enough
after
dinner
alma
found
her
courage
and
the
fitting
moment
have
something
disagreeable
to
talk
about
dymes
called
this
afternoon
and
handed
in
his
bill
yes
yes
i
what
all
this
surely
you
obliged
him
to
come
looking
after
his
money
the
first
account
i
have
received
rolfe
puckered
his
face
a
little
as
he
perused
the
document
but
ended
as
he
began
with
a
smile
in
silence
he
turned
to
the
took
out
his
and
wrote
do
mind
its
being
in
my
name
at
all
indeed
i
prefer
it
but
i
am
sorry
and
ashamed
she
added
in
a
murmur
it
be
taken
to
the
post
at
once
said
rolfe
quietly
when
this
was
done
alma
made
known
what
dymes
had
told
her
about
sibyl
speaking
in
an
unconcerned
voice
and
refraining
from
any
hint
of
suspicion
or
censure
had
heard
of
it
said
harvey
with
troubled
brow
and
evidently
wished
to
say
no
more
do
you
suppose
carnaby
will
do
alma
inquired
to
say
i
told
that
the
business
at
coventry
is
flourishing
and
no
doubt
his
interest
in
it
remains
i
hear
too
that
those
queensland
mines
are
profitable
at
last
so
there
be
no
money
troubles
but
what
he
will
do
the
subject
was
dropped
harvey
had
succeeded
in
hiding
his
annoyance
at
the
large
debt
to
dymes
a
sum
he
could
ill
afford
but
he
was
glad
to
have
paid
it
and
pleased
with
alma
way
of
dismissing
it
to
oblivion
the
talk
that
followed
had
turned
his
mind
upon
a
graver
trouble
he
sat
thinking
of
hugh
carnaby
dear
old
hugh
not
long
ago
the
report
ran
that
his
health
was
in
a
bad
state
to
one
who
knew
him
the
wonder
was
that
he
kept
alive
but
the
second
year
drew
on
chapter
on
monday
morning
when
harvey
and
his
friend
had
started
for
town
and
hughie
was
at
school
alma
made
ready
to
go
out
in
many
months
she
had
been
to
london
only
two
or
three
times
thus
alone
could
she
subdue
herself
she
tried
to
forget
all
that
lay
eastward
from
gunnersbury
rejecting
every
kind
of
town
amusement
and
finding
society
in
a
very
small
circle
of
acquaintances
who
lived
almost
as
quietly
as
herself
but
this
morning
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
made
irresistible
by
dymes
visit
in
leaving
the
house
she
seemed
to
escape
from
an
atmosphere
so
still
and
heavy
that
it
threatened
her
blood
with
stagnation
she
breathed
deeply
of
the
free
air
and
hastened
towards
the
railway
as
if
she
had
some
great
pleasure
before
her
but
this
mood
had
passed
long
before
the
end
of
her
journey
alighting
at
queen
road
she
walked
hurriedly
to
porchester
terrace
and
from
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
had
a
view
of
strangeways
house
it
was
empty
to
let
she
crossed
and
rang
the
bell
on
the
chance
that
some
caretaker
might
be
within
but
no
one
answered
her
heart
throbbing
painfully
she
went
on
a
little
distance
then
stood
irresolute
a
cab
crawled
by
she
raised
her
hand
and
gave
the
direction
and
cambridge
mansions
once
here
she
had
no
difficulty
in
carrying
out
her
purpose
passion
came
to
her
aid
and
when
sibyl
door
opened
she
could
hardly
wait
for
an
invitation
before
stepping
in
the
was
changed
it
had
been
refurnished
and
looked
even
more
luxurious
than
formerly
for
nearly
ten
minutes
she
had
to
stand
waiting
seat
herself
she
could
not
then
entered
sibyl
morning
rolfe
i
am
glad
to
see
you
the
latter
sentence
was
spoken
not
as
a
mere
phrase
of
courtesy
but
with
intention
with
quiet
yet
unmistakable
significance
sibyl
did
not
offer
her
hand
she
moved
a
chair
so
that
its
back
was
to
the
light
and
sat
down
very
much
as
she
might
have
done
if
receiving
an
applicant
for
a
had
some
reason
for
coming
so
early
alma
who
had
felt
uncertain
how
this
interview
would
begin
was
glad
that
she
had
to
meet
no
pretences
of
friendship
her
heart
burned
within
her
she
was
pallid
and
her
eyes
shone
fiercely
came
to
ask
if
you
could
tell
me
where
strangeways
is
to
be
found
strangeways
sibyl
repeated
with
cold
surprise
know
nothing
about
her
feeling
in
every
way
at
a
disadvantage
contrast
of
costume
told
in
sibyl
favour
and
it
was
enhanced
by
the
perfection
of
her
alma
could
not
maintain
the
mockery
of
politeness
course
you
say
that
she
rejoined
haughtily
of
course
i
do
believe
it
is
nothing
to
me
rolfe
remarked
the
other
smiling
you
have
your
own
reasons
for
declining
to
believe
me
just
as
you
have
your
own
reasons
for
other
things
your
next
inquiry
it
been
rather
unwise
of
you
keeping
away
from
me
all
this
time
i
hardly
see
your
meaning
looked
rather
as
if
you
felt
afraid
to
meet
me
see
that
is
your
point
of
view
sibyl
seemed
to
reflect
upon
it
calmly
me
on
the
other
hand
it
appeared
rather
strange
that
i
neither
saw
nor
heard
from
you
at
a
time
when
other
friends
were
showing
their
sympathy
i
heard
that
you
were
ill
for
a
short
time
and
felt
sorry
i
was
unable
to
call
later
you
still
kept
silence
i
did
know
the
reason
and
could
hardly
be
expected
to
ask
for
it
as
for
being
afraid
to
meet
you
that
i
suppose
is
a
suspicion
natural
to
your
mind
we
wo
discuss
it
is
there
any
other
question
you
would
like
to
ask
humiliated
by
her
inability
to
reply
with
anything
but
a
charge
she
could
not
support
and
fearing
the
violence
of
her
emotions
if
she
were
longer
subjected
to
this
frigid
insult
alma
rose
moment
if
you
please
continued
carnaby
was
glad
that
you
had
come
as
i
had
half
wished
for
an
opportunity
of
speaking
a
few
words
to
you
it
is
a
matter
of
much
importance
but
i
may
as
well
say
perhaps
that
you
are
indiscreet
in
your
way
of
talking
about
me
to
your
friends
of
course
we
have
many
acquaintances
in
common
but
i
happen
to
have
heard
the
opinion
of
me
which
you
expressed
to
let
me
see
some
ladies
named
leach
whom
i
once
knew
slightly
it
seems
hardly
worth
while
to
take
serious
steps
in
the
matter
though
i
might
find
it
necessary
i
only
wish
in
your
own
interest
to
say
a
word
of
warning
you
have
behaved
all
things
considered
she
dwelt
on
the
phrase
indiscreetly
said
what
i
knew
to
be
the
truth
replied
alma
meeting
her
look
with
the
satisfaction
of
defiance
sibyl
approached
one
step
knew
it
she
asked
very
softly
and
deliberately
searching
the
passionate
face
with
eyes
as
piercing
as
they
were
beautiful
certainty
used
to
think
you
intelligent
said
sibyl
i
fancy
you
perceive
what
this
certainty
of
yours
suggests
she
paused
with
a
curling
lip
me
put
you
on
your
guard
you
have
very
little
command
of
your
primitive
feelings
and
they
bring
you
into
danger
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
that
an
unpleasant
story
i
have
heard
whispered
was
anything
more
than
scandal
but
it
as
well
to
warn
you
that
people
have
a
taste
for
that
kind
of
gossip
well
aware
of
it
flashed
the
listener
that
was
the
very
reason
why
i
came
to
ask
you
where
strangeways
is
hiding
rolfe
you
are
aware
of
too
many
things
in
your
position
i
should
be
uneasy
will
leave
you
to
enjoy
your
uneasiness
returned
alma
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
must
have
enough
of
it
without
imagining
that
of
others
she
half
turned
sibyl
again
took
one
step
forward
and
spoke
with
ever
so
little
tremor
in
the
even
voice
have
understood
me
i
hope
quite
you
have
shown
plainly
how
afraid
you
are
good
morning
mrs
carnaby
baker
street
station
being
so
near
alma
was
tempted
to
go
straightway
and
demand
from
the
leach
sisters
an
explanation
of
what
she
had
heard
they
too
seemed
to
be
behaving
treacherously
but
she
was
unwilling
to
miss
the
luncheon
hour
at
home
for
hughie
would
speak
of
it
to
his
father
and
so
oblige
her
to
make
false
excuses
besides
she
had
suffered
more
than
enough
indignity
though
not
unavenged
and
it
was
better
to
summon
the
sisters
to
her
presence
on
reaching
home
she
at
once
sent
them
an
ordinary
invitation
but
of
the
briefest
in
the
evening
she
received
dymes
acknowledgment
of
the
cheque
next
day
she
wrote
to
him
a
few
formal
lines
requesting
that
he
would
let
her
know
strangeways
address
as
soon
as
he
had
discovered
it
dora
leach
came
to
gunnersbury
alone
she
was
in
distress
and
worry
for
her
father
had
fallen
ill
again
and
the
doctors
doubted
whether
he
would
ever
be
fit
to
resume
work
it
had
just
dawned
upon
dora
that
the
breadwinner
of
the
family
deserved
rather
more
consideration
than
he
had
been
wont
to
receive
and
that
his
death
might
involve
unpleasant
consequences
for
those
dependent
upon
him
to
alma
questioning
she
replied
frankly
and
with
it
was
true
that
she
had
whispered
her
friend
suspicions
of
carnaby
but
only
to
one
person
and
in
strictest
confidence
neither
she
nor
gerda
had
met
mrs
carnaby
and
how
the
whisper
could
have
reached
sibyl
ears
was
inconceivable
to
her
does
matter
in
the
least
said
alma
finally
tell
you
the
truth
i
not
sorry
that
just
what
i
thought
exclaimed
dora
with
sudden
clearing
of
her
countenance
in
a
fortnight
or
so
there
came
a
note
from
dymes
written
at
brussels
he
had
ascertained
that
strangeways
was
somewhere
on
the
continent
but
as
yet
he
could
not
succeed
in
her
down
let
rolfe
depend
upon
his
zeal
in
this
search
as
in
any
other
matter
in
which
he
could
be
of
use
to
her
unfortunately
this
envelope
came
under
harvey
eyes
and
alma
knowing
he
had
seen
it
felt
obliged
to
speak
dymes
refuses
to
believe
that
i
shall
never
play
again
in
public
she
remarked
putting
down
his
letter
as
carelessly
as
possible
by
her
plate
at
breakfast
he
pester
you
if
so
it
might
be
better
for
me
to
dear
no
i
can
manage
my
own
correspondence
harvey
thank
you
her
tone
of
slight
petulance
was
due
to
fear
that
he
might
ask
to
see
the
letter
and
it
had
its
effect
but
alma
heart
sank
at
the
deception
and
her
skill
in
practising
it
was
it
impossible
to
become
what
she
desired
to
be
an
honest
woman
only
yesterday
harvey
had
spoken
to
her
with
vexation
of
a
piece
of
untruthfulness
in
hughie
and
had
begged
her
to
keep
a
watch
upon
the
child
habit
in
this
respect
and
she
had
promised
with
much
earnestness
much
concern
there
are
women
who
can
breathe
only
in
the
air
of
lies
and
of
treachery
alma
rebelled
against
the
fate
which
made
her
life
dishonourable
fate
she
declared
not
the
depravity
of
her
own
heart
from
the
dark
day
that
saw
her
father
ruin
she
had
been
condemned
to
a
struggle
with
circumstances
she
meant
honestly
she
asked
no
more
than
the
free
exercise
of
instincts
nature
had
given
her
but
destiny
was
adverse
and
step
by
step
had
brought
her
into
a
position
so
false
so
hopeless
that
she
wondered
at
her
strength
in
living
on
hughie
had
begun
to
learn
the
maps
of
countries
and
prided
himself
on
naming
them
as
he
turned
over
an
atlas
one
day
about
this
time
she
looked
over
his
shoulder
and
saw
the
map
of
italy
are
lakes
said
the
child
pointing
north
me
their
names
mother
but
she
was
silent
her
eye
had
fallen
upon
garda
and
at
the
head
of
the
lake
was
a
name
which
thrilled
her
memory
what
if
she
had
gone
to
riva
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
she
saw
it
as
a
thing
that
might
have
happened
not
as
a
mere
dark
suggestion
abhorrent
to
her
thought
had
she
known
the
world
a
little
better
it
might
have
been
then
how
different
her
life
pleasure
luxury
triumph
for
she
had
proved
herself
capable
of
triumphing
he
the
man
of
money
and
influence
would
have
made
it
his
pride
to
smooth
the
way
for
her
and
perhaps
never
a
word
against
her
reputation
or
if
whispers
did
she
not
know
by
this
time
how
indulgent
society
can
be
to
its
brilliant
favourites
as
it
was
a
small
house
at
gunnersbury
a
baffled
ambition
a
life
of
envy
hatred
fear
suffered
in
secret
hidden
by
base
or
paltry
subterfuge
a
husband
whom
she
respected
whose
love
she
had
never
ceased
to
desire
though
strange
to
say
she
knew
not
whether
she
loved
him
only
death
could
part
them
but
how
much
better
for
him
and
for
her
if
they
had
never
met
their
thoughts
and
purposes
so
unlike
he
with
his
heart
and
mind
set
on
grave
quiet
restful
things
hating
the
world
tumult
ever
hoping
to
retire
beyond
its
echo
she
her
senses
crying
for
the
delight
of
an
existence
that
loses
itself
in
whirl
and
glare
in
a
crowded
she
had
heard
someone
draw
attention
to
her
daughter
of
bennet
frothingham
that
was
how
people
thought
of
her
and
would
it
not
have
been
wiser
if
she
had
so
thought
of
herself
daughter
of
a
man
who
had
set
all
on
a
great
hazard
who
had
played
for
the
world
reward
and
losing
flung
away
his
life
what
had
to
do
with
domestic
virtues
and
the
pleasures
of
a
dull
decorous
circle
could
it
but
come
over
again
she
would
accept
the
challenge
of
circumstance
which
she
had
failed
to
understand
accept
the
scandal
and
the
hereditary
shame
welcome
the
lot
cast
for
her
and
like
her
father
play
boldly
for
the
great
stakes
his
widow
might
continue
to
hold
her
pious
faith
in
him
and
refuse
to
believe
that
his
name
merited
obloquy
his
child
knew
better
she
had
mistaken
her
path
lost
the
promise
of
her
beauty
and
her
talent
led
astray
by
the
feeble
prejudice
of
those
who
have
neither
one
nor
the
other
too
late
and
worse
than
idle
now
to
recognise
it
she
would
be
a
good
woman
rule
her
little
house
bring
up
her
child
and
have
no
will
but
her
husband
was
no
easy
matter
things
did
not
go
as
she
wished
the
servants
were
inefficient
sometimes
refractory
and
she
loathed
the
task
of
keeping
them
up
to
their
duties
insomnia
began
to
trouble
her
again
and
presently
she
had
recourse
to
the
forbidden
not
regularly
but
once
a
week
or
so
when
the
long
night
harried
her
beyond
endurance
rolfe
did
not
suspect
it
for
she
never
complained
to
him
winter
was
her
bad
time
in
the
spring
her
health
would
improve
as
usual
and
then
she
would
give
up
the
habit
at
christmas
the
langlands
had
the
customary
visit
from
their
relative
thistlewood
who
renewed
his
acquaintance
with
alma
at
their
first
meeting
she
was
struck
by
his
buoyant
air
his
animated
talk
a
week
later
he
called
in
the
afternoon
two
ladies
happened
to
be
with
alma
and
they
stayed
a
long
time
but
thistlewood
who
comported
himself
rather
oddly
saying
little
and
sometimes
neglecting
a
remark
addressed
to
him
stayed
yet
longer
when
he
was
alone
with
his
hostess
he
took
a
chair
near
to
her
bent
forward
and
said
smiling
remember
our
talk
about
marriage
on
a
minute
income
do
very
well
have
found
someone
who
is
afraid
of
it
have
the
same
person
who
formerly
she
was
not
afraid
of
the
income
but
of
me
i
could
be
surprised
though
it
hit
me
hard
time
has
spoken
for
me
harvey
was
dining
in
town
he
came
back
with
vexatious
news
about
cecil
morphew
who
neglected
business
looked
ill
and
altogether
seemed
in
a
bad
way
as
he
talked
he
began
to
notice
that
alma
regarded
him
with
brighter
and
happier
eyes
than
for
many
a
day
does
it
amuse
you
he
asked
stopping
in
his
narrative
does
i
as
sorry
as
you
are
but
i
have
a
surprise
for
you
pleasant
one
this
time
i
see
abbott
is
going
to
marry
mr
thistlewood
she
watched
the
effect
of
her
words
and
for
an
instant
felt
the
old
pang
the
old
bitterness
but
harvey
confusion
of
feeling
soon
passed
giving
way
to
a
satisfaction
that
could
not
be
mistaken
has
told
you
happy
man
himself
am
glad
heartily
glad
but
i
did
think
it
would
interest
you
so
much
women
marriages
she
threw
a
pretty
scorn
upon
herself
that
good
news
they
will
suit
each
other
but
she
give
up
her
school
and
that
a
nuisance
are
others
as
good
not
here
another
removal
i
when
is
it
to
be
till
the
easter
holidays
they
were
in
the
library
harvey
began
to
fill
his
pipe
and
nothing
more
was
said
until
he
had
drawn
a
few
meditative
puffs
removal
then
escaped
him
with
half
a
groan
should
you
care
asked
alma
thoughtfully
do
like
this
place
well
as
any
other
it
convenient
for
town
you
really
think
of
going
on
in
that
business
which
you
detest
has
brought
in
a
little
money
and
may
ought
to
bring
more
but
if
morphew
goes
down
alma
glanced
at
him
and
said
timidly
are
going
to
greystone
at
easter
shall
all
go
what
of
that
you
she
spoke
with
an
effort
thought
you
would
like
to
live
there
heavens
alma
he
stared
at
her
in
humorous
astonishment
then
slowly
shook
his
head
how
could
live
in
such
a
place
as
greystone
and
what
on
earth
did
she
mean
by
disturbing
him
with
such
a
suggestion
but
alma
gravely
and
repeatedly
assured
him
that
she
could
live
there
very
well
that
in
all
likelihood
she
would
be
much
more
contented
there
than
here
should
bring
out
my
violin
again
and
the
greystone
people
would
admire
me
there
a
confession
to
prove
that
i
am
in
earnest
i
conquer
the
world
i
do
wish
it
that
all
over
but
i
should
find
it
pleasant
to
have
a
reputation
in
greystone
i
should
indeed
harvey
sighed
and
could
not
look
at
her
hughie
she
continued
go
to
the
you
know
how
you
would
like
that
and
living
there
is
cheap
we
might
keep
our
horse
do
say
anything
now
but
think
about
it
he
raised
his
eyes
and
fixed
them
upon
her
with
a
look
of
infinite
tenderness
and
gratitude
it
was
alma
now
who
sighed
but
not
audibly
before
thistlewood
went
north
again
harvey
enjoyed
long
talks
with
him
mary
abbott
he
saw
only
in
the
presence
of
other
people
but
on
an
evening
in
february
when
alma
was
at
the
langlands
and
he
had
promised
to
call
for
her
at
ten
he
left
home
an
hour
earlier
and
walked
past
abbott
house
a
light
in
the
window
of
her
showed
that
mary
was
at
home
after
a
turn
or
two
backwards
and
forwards
he
went
up
to
the
door
and
knocked
a
very
young
servant
took
his
name
to
her
mistress
and
then
admitted
him
you
let
me
answer
your
letter
personally
he
said
as
abbott
welcomed
him
in
the
room
where
she
sat
alone
she
had
written
about
minnie
wager
begging
that
he
would
in
future
cease
to
contribute
to
the
girl
support
and
be
responsible
only
for
the
boy
in
her
new
home
there
would
be
no
need
of
a
servant
she
and
minnie
would
do
the
housework
together
impossible
she
wrote
to
speak
of
his
kindness
both
to
her
and
the
children
for
minnie
who
might
henceforth
be
looked
upon
as
he
must
no
longer
be
taxed
the
child
owed
him
every
hope
in
her
life
let
him
be
satisfied
with
what
he
had
done
so
generously
of
these
things
they
talked
for
a
few
minutes
it
was
easy
to
see
how
great
a
change
had
befallen
mary
abbott
outlook
upon
life
she
was
younger
by
several
years
yet
not
like
herself
of
that
earlier
time
much
gentler
much
sweeter
in
face
and
word
harvey
observed
her
with
keen
pleasure
and
becoming
aware
of
his
gaze
his
smile
she
blushed
like
a
girl
rolfe
i
am
sure
you
feel
that
i
am
deserting
my
post
be
sure
you
are
i
shall
always
owe
you
a
grudge
for
it
thought
of
it
all
of
hughie
and
the
others
i
did
know
how
i
should
ever
face
you
a
shameless
thing
and
yet
i
can
find
it
in
my
heart
to
forgive
you
you
are
so
ingenuous
about
it
mary
looked
up
again
shall
you
do
about
hughie
there
a
great
scheme
on
foot
alma
suggests
that
we
shall
go
and
live
at
greystone
it
tempts
me
it
must
indeed
i
know
how
you
would
like
it
should
be
so
very
far
apart
then
an
hour
journey
or
so
you
would
come
to
us
and
we
to
you
they
had
not
much
more
to
say
but
each
was
conscious
of
thought
in
the
other
mind
that
supplemented
their
insufficient
phrases
as
they
shook
hands
mary
seemed
trying
to
speak
the
lamplight
made
a
glimmer
in
her
eyes
and
their
lids
drooped
as
she
said
at
length
am
so
glad
that
you
like
each
other
a
splendid
fellow
replied
rolfe
joyously
think
no
end
of
him
he
of
you
for
i
have
told
him
everything
then
harvey
quitted
the
house
and
walked
about
under
the
starry
sky
until
it
was
time
to
call
for
alma
chapter
yet
once
again
did
alma
hypnotise
her
imagination
with
a
new
ideal
of
life
her
talk
was
constantly
of
greystone
she
began
a
correspondence
with
morton
who
did
her
best
to
encourage
all
pleasant
anticipations
careful
the
while
at
her
husband
bidding
and
too
not
to
exaggerate
the
resources
of
greystone
for
a
mind
and
temper
such
as
alma
of
course
the
little
town
had
its
musical
circle
in
which
rolfe
talent
would
find
an
appreciative
reception
touching
on
this
point
to
her
correspondent
alma
remarked
with
emphasised
modesty
that
she
must
be
regarded
as
a
professional
violinist
it
would
be
better
perhaps
if
nothing
were
said
about
her
audacious
experiment
in
london
meanwhile
a
suitable
house
was
being
looked
for
there
need
be
no
hurry
midsummer
was
the
earliest
possible
date
for
removal
and
a
few
months
later
might
prove
more
convenient
at
easter
came
mary
abbott
wedding
which
was
celebrated
as
quietly
as
might
be
alma
had
done
her
utmost
to
atone
for
bygone
slights
and
coldness
she
and
mary
did
not
love
each
other
nor
ever
could
and
for
that
reason
they
were
all
the
more
affectionate
at
this
agitating
time
when
all
was
over
the
rolfes
set
forth
on
their
visit
to
greystone
harvey
could
not
look
forward
to
complete
enjoyment
of
the
holiday
for
by
this
time
cecil
morphew
had
succumbed
to
his
old
habits
of
tossing
indolence
and
only
pretended
to
look
after
his
business
if
harvey
withdrew
the
shop
must
either
be
closed
or
pass
into
other
hands
pecuniary
loss
was
the
least
vexatious
part
of
the
affair
morphew
reckless
in
the
ruin
of
his
dearest
hope
would
seek
excitement
try
once
more
to
enrich
himself
by
gambling
and
so
go
down
to
the
depths
whence
there
is
no
rescue
as
a
last
hope
harvey
had
written
to
henrietta
winter
a
long
letter
of
all
but
passionate
appeal
for
answer
he
received
a
few
lines
infinitely
sorrowful
but
of
inflexible
resolve
the
sight
of
god
morphew
already
has
a
wife
i
should
be
guilty
of
a
crime
if
i
married
him
with
a
desperate
ejaculation
rolfe
crushed
up
the
sheet
of
paper
and
turned
to
other
things
whilst
she
was
at
greystone
alma
heard
again
from
felix
dymes
his
letter
having
been
forwarded
he
wrote
that
strangeways
was
about
to
return
to
england
and
that
before
long
she
might
be
heard
of
at
a
certain
hotel
in
london
as
this
letter
had
escaped
harvey
notice
alma
was
spared
the
necessity
of
shaping
a
fiction
about
it
glad
of
this
and
all
but
decided
to
put
strangeways
utterly
out
of
her
life
and
mind
she
sent
no
answer
but
when
she
had
been
back
again
for
some
weeks
at
gunnersbury
when
a
house
at
greystone
was
taken
though
it
would
not
be
ready
for
them
till
michaelmas
when
she
was
endeavouring
day
after
day
to
teach
hughie
and
to
manage
her
servants
and
to
support
a
wavering
hope
there
arrived
one
morning
a
letter
from
strangeways
it
was
dated
from
the
hotel
which
dymes
had
mentioned
and
it
asked
alma
to
call
there
a
simple
friendly
invitation
suggestive
of
tea
and
chat
alma
did
not
speak
of
it
and
for
an
hour
or
two
thought
she
could
disregard
it
altogether
but
that
evening
she
talked
to
harvey
of
shopping
she
had
to
do
in
town
and
the
following
afternoon
she
called
upon
strangeways
a
lift
carried
her
to
the
topmost
or
all
but
topmost
storey
of
the
vast
hotel
swarming
murmurous
she
entered
a
small
pretentiously
comfortless
and
from
a
chair
by
the
open
window
for
it
was
a
day
of
hot
sunshine
strangeways
rose
to
greet
her
quite
in
the
old
way
smiling
with
head
aside
cooing
rapidly
an
effusive
welcome
alma
looked
round
to
see
that
the
door
was
shut
then
declining
the
offered
hand
she
said
coldly
are
mistaken
if
you
think
i
have
come
as
a
friend
i
am
so
sorry
to
hear
you
say
that
do
sit
down
and
let
me
hear
all
about
it
i
have
so
looked
forward
to
seeing
you
am
only
here
to
ask
what
good
it
can
do
you
to
talk
ill
of
me
really
do
understand
i
am
quite
at
a
loss
i
know
for
certain
that
you
have
tried
to
injure
me
by
telling
extraordinary
falsehoods
strangeways
regarded
her
with
an
air
of
gently
troubled
deprecation
you
have
been
grievously
misled
who
can
have
told
you
this
name
does
matter
i
have
no
doubt
of
the
fact
at
least
you
will
tell
me
what
i
am
supposed
to
have
said
alma
hesitated
and
only
after
several
interchanges
of
question
and
answer
did
the
full
extent
of
her
accusation
appear
thereupon
mrs
strangeways
smiled
as
if
with
forbearance
i
understand
but
i
have
been
cruelly
misrepresented
i
heard
such
a
rumour
and
i
did
my
best
to
contradict
it
i
heard
it
unfortunately
more
than
once
again
alma
found
herself
in
conflict
with
an
adroitness
a
so
much
beyond
her
own
that
the
sense
of
being
maliciously
played
with
goaded
her
into
rage
one
but
yourself
could
ever
have
started
such
a
story
mean
sounded
the
other
voice
still
soft
though
not
quite
so
amiable
i
was
the
only
person
who
knew
and
there
strangeways
paused
as
if
discreetly
knew
what
that
you
had
reason
for
a
little
spite
against
your
dear
friend
it
was
so
exclaimed
alma
remembering
too
well
her
last
conversation
with
this
woman
you
knew
or
thought
you
knew
about
me
and
it
was
little
enough
you
have
been
making
use
of
it
disgracefully
say
i
knew
very
little
put
in
the
other
turning
a
ring
upon
her
hand
you
will
admit
that
it
was
enough
to
excite
my
curiosity
may
i
not
have
taken
trouble
to
learn
more
amount
of
trouble
would
have
taught
you
nothing
there
was
nothing
to
discover
and
that
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
strangeways
moved
her
head
as
if
in
acquiescence
let
us
be
harsh
with
each
other
my
dear
we
have
both
had
our
worries
and
trials
in
consequence
of
that
unfortunate
affair
you
i
can
see
have
gone
through
a
good
deal
i
assure
you
so
have
i
but
ought
you
to
remember
that
our
misfortunes
were
caused
by
the
same
person
if
i
misfortunes
are
nothing
to
me
and
i
should
think
you
would
care
to
talk
about
them
i
might
say
the
same
to
you
my
dear
alma
is
there
very
much
to
choose
between
us
alma
flushed
with
resentment
but
had
no
word
ready
on
her
parched
tongue
the
other
went
on
in
an
unbroken
flow
of
mocking
good
humour
ought
to
be
the
best
of
friends
i
have
the
least
wish
to
do
you
harm
and
nothing
would
please
me
better
than
to
gratify
your
little
feeling
against
a
certain
person
i
may
be
able
to
manage
that
let
me
tell
you
something
of
course
in
the
strictest
confidence
her
voice
was
playful
for
a
moment
have
been
trying
to
find
someone
you
know
who
i
mean
who
mysteriously
disappeared
that
interests
you
i
see
it
very
difficult
such
people
do
let
themselves
be
dropped
upon
by
chance
a
second
time
but
do
you
know
i
have
something
very
like
a
clue
at
last
yes
she
nodded
familiarly
have
in
vain
alma
tried
to
lock
her
lips
if
you
find
her
you
forget
that
someone
will
very
soon
be
at
large
again
and
that
someone
wife
a
very
clever
woman
counts
on
deceiving
the
world
as
she
deceived
are
sure
she
deceive
him
strangeways
laughed
are
acute
my
dear
you
see
the
puzzle
from
all
sides
but
i
go
into
that
just
now
what
i
want
to
show
you
is
that
our
interests
are
the
same
we
should
both
dearly
like
to
see
a
certain
person
shown
up
i
begin
to
see
my
way
to
do
it
very
thoroughly
it
would
delight
you
if
i
were
at
liberty
to
tell
what
i
actually
got
hold
of
but
you
must
wait
a
little
my
worst
difficulty
now
is
want
of
money
people
have
to
be
bought
you
know
and
i
am
not
rich
do
you
think
you
could
help
a
little
the
question
came
out
with
smooth
abruptness
accompanied
by
a
look
which
startled
the
hearer
i
have
no
money
an
idea
tell
you
i
have
a
penny
of
my
own
dear
alma
you
have
obliging
bankers
one
of
them
is
doing
very
well
indeed
you
did
go
to
his
wedding
alma
felt
a
chill
of
fear
the
woman
eyes
seemed
to
cast
a
net
about
her
and
to
watch
her
struggle
as
it
tightened
do
understand
you
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
plots
she
strung
her
muscles
and
stood
up
but
strangeways
scarcely
moving
still
looked
at
her
with
baleful
directness
would
be
a
shame
to
lose
our
sport
for
want
of
a
little
money
i
must
ask
you
to
help
really
ca
and
wo
feel
sure
you
will
rather
than
have
anything
happen
you
are
leading
i
hear
a
most
exemplary
life
i
should
be
so
sorry
to
disturb
it
but
really
you
help
in
our
undertaking
there
was
a
very
short
silence
week
even
a
fortnight
hence
will
do
no
great
sum
two
or
three
hundred
pounds
we
wo
say
any
more
about
it
i
depend
upon
you
in
a
fortnight
time
will
do
you
imagine
exclaimed
alma
on
a
high
quivering
note
i
am
in
your
power
it
is
very
dangerous
to
talk
like
that
in
a
think
over
what
i
have
said
you
will
find
me
here
think
and
remember
you
will
be
quite
satisfied
with
the
results
but
your
help
is
indispensable
therewith
strangeways
turned
to
the
open
window
looking
at
her
elaborately
plaited
yellow
hair
her
thin
neck
her
delicate
fingers
just
touching
the
long
throat
alma
felt
instinct
of
savagery
in
a
flash
of
the
primitive
mind
she
saw
herself
spring
upon
her
enemy
tear
bite
destroy
the
desire
still
shook
her
as
she
stood
outside
in
the
corridor
waiting
to
descend
and
in
the
street
she
walked
like
a
somnambulist
with
wide
eyes
straight
on
curious
glances
at
length
recalled
her
to
herself
she
turned
hurriedly
from
the
crowded
highway
before
reaching
home
she
had
surveyed
her
position
searched
her
memory
wretch
is
counting
on
my
weakness
knowing
she
can
do
nothing
she
thinks
i
shall
be
frightened
by
the
threat
money
and
perhaps
all
she
said
only
a
lie
to
tempt
me
let
her
do
her
worst
and
that
will
be
nothing
and
by
this
she
held
letting
the
days
go
by
the
fortnight
passed
she
was
ill
with
apprehension
with
suspense
but
nothing
happened
three
weeks
and
nothing
happened
then
alma
laughed
and
went
about
the
house
singing
her
deliverance
on
that
day
strangeways
sat
talking
with
carnaby
in
the
latter
her
manner
was
deferential
but
that
of
a
friend
sibyl
queening
it
at
some
distance
had
the
air
of
conferring
a
favour
as
she
listened
have
the
least
doubt
that
i
shall
soon
lay
my
hand
upon
her
i
have
had
an
answer
to
my
last
advertisement
let
me
see
it
replied
sibyl
coldly
i
put
myself
in
a
position
of
much
danger
i
dare
not
trust
even
you
mrs
carnaby
well
you
know
my
promise
get
her
into
the
hands
of
the
police
and
your
reward
is
waiting
i
may
lose
my
opportunity
for
want
of
money
if
you
would
trust
me
with
only
say
a
hundred
pounds
a
farthing
i
did
ask
you
to
undertake
this
if
you
do
it
well
and
good
i
will
pay
you
but
nothing
till
then
strangeways
perused
the
carpet
else
she
murmured
be
tempted
to
think
that
you
really
care
to
have
her
caught
may
be
tempted
to
think
exactly
what
you
like
answered
sibyl
with
fine
scorn
the
other
scrutinised
her
with
an
eye
of
anxious
uncertainty
you
thought
again
of
taking
any
steps
in
the
other
matter
you
anything
to
show
but
it
can
be
obtained
a
charge
of
slander
could
be
brought
against
her
at
any
moment
if
you
prefer
libel
it
is
merely
taking
a
little
trouble
sibyl
reflected
is
no
hurry
i
will
pay
you
as
i
said
for
any
trustworthy
evidence
of
any
kind
you
bring
me
does
she
come
to
see
you
have
you
succeeded
in
making
pay
asked
sibyl
with
a
curl
of
the
lips
strangeways
merely
smiled
after
a
brief
pause
sibyl
looked
at
her
watch
and
rose
have
an
engagement
and
pray
do
trouble
to
come
again
unless
you
have
really
something
to
come
for
i
ca
pretend
to
have
any
taste
for
this
kind
of
conversation
it
really
matters
very
little
we
know
that
woman
will
be
caught
some
day
and
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
prosecuting
her
for
stealing
my
jewellery
and
things
the
other
person
perhaps
she
is
a
little
beneath
my
notice
she
rang
the
bell
and
strangeways
having
no
alternative
slightly
bent
her
head
and
withdrew
carnaby
had
no
engagement
she
was
quite
at
leisure
and
as
usual
nowadays
spent
her
leisure
in
thought
she
did
not
read
much
and
not
at
all
in
the
solid
books
which
were
to
be
seen
lying
about
her
rooms
but
lady
isobel
barker
and
a
few
other
people
admired
her
devotion
to
study
certainly
one
or
two
lines
had
begun
to
reveal
themselves
on
sibyl
forehead
which
might
possibly
have
come
of
late
reading
and
memory
overstrained
they
might
also
be
the
record
of
other
experiences
her
beauty
was
more
than
ever
of
the
austere
type
in
regarding
her
one
could
have
murmured
chaste
a
the
icicle
that
curded
by
the
frost
from
purest
snow
and
hangs
on
dian
temple
but
in
privacy
sibyl
did
not
look
her
best
assuredly
not
after
the
withdrawal
of
strangeways
when
her
lips
sneering
away
their
fine
contour
grew
to
an
ugly
hardness
and
her
eyes
smalled
themselves
in
a
vicious
intensity
of
mental
vision
chapter
major
carnaby
hugh
brother
was
now
in
england
a
stranger
to
the
society
in
which
carnaby
had
lived
he
knew
nothing
of
the
gossip
at
one
time
threatening
her
with
banishment
from
polite
circles
an
honest
man
and
taking
for
granted
the
honesty
of
his
kinsfolk
he
put
entire
faith
in
hugh
story
despatched
to
him
by
letter
a
few
days
after
the
calamitous
event
at
wimbledon
on
arriving
in
london
the
good
major
was
pleased
touched
flattered
by
the
very
warm
welcome
with
which
his
received
him
hitherto
they
had
seen
hardly
anything
of
each
other
but
since
the
disaster
their
correspondence
had
been
frequent
and
sibyl
letters
were
so
brave
yet
so
pathetic
that
major
carnaby
formed
the
highest
opinion
of
her
she
did
not
pose
as
an
injured
woman
she
never
so
much
as
hinted
at
the
activity
of
slanderous
tongues
she
spoke
only
of
hugh
the
dear
kind
noble
fellow
whom
fate
had
so
cruelly
visited
the
favourable
impression
was
confirmed
as
soon
as
they
met
the
major
found
that
this
beautiful
creature
had
among
her
many
virtues
a
sound
capacity
for
business
no
one
could
have
looked
after
her
worldly
interests
with
more
assiduity
and
circumspection
he
saw
that
hugh
had
been
quite
right
in
assuring
him
at
sibyl
instance
that
there
was
no
need
whatever
for
him
to
neglect
his
military
duties
and
come
home
at
an
inconvenient
time
hugh
affairs
were
in
perfect
order
all
he
would
have
to
think
about
was
the
recovery
of
health
and
mental
tranquillity
to
this
end
they
must
decide
upon
some
retreat
in
which
he
might
pass
a
quiet
month
or
two
that
dear
and
invaluable
friend
to
whom
sibyl
owed
than
she
could
tell
much
more
than
she
could
tell
to
major
carnaby
was
ready
with
a
delightful
suggestion
lady
isobel
that
is
to
say
her
auriferous
husband
plain
barker
had
a
little
house
in
the
north
cosy
amid
moor
and
mountain
and
she
freely
offered
it
there
hugh
and
his
wife
might
abide
in
solitude
until
the
sacred
twelfth
when
religious
observance
would
call
thither
a
small
company
of
select
pilgrims
the
offer
was
gratefully
accepted
major
carnaby
saw
no
reason
for
hesitating
and
agreed
with
sibyl
that
the
plan
should
be
withheld
from
hugh
until
the
last
moment
as
a
gratifying
surprise
by
some
means
however
on
the
day
before
hugh
release
there
appeared
in
certain
newspapers
a
little
paragraph
making
known
to
the
public
this
proof
of
lady
isabel
friendship
for
sibyl
and
her
husband
just
as
well
said
carnaby
after
appearing
vexed
for
a
moment
will
be
saved
the
trouble
of
calling
here
but
it
really
is
mysterious
how
the
papers
get
hold
of
things
she
was
not
quite
sure
that
hugh
would
approve
her
arrangement
and
the
event
justified
this
misgiving
major
carnaby
was
to
bring
his
brother
to
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
and
if
possible
all
were
to
travel
northward
that
same
day
but
hugh
on
hearing
what
was
proposed
made
strong
objection
he
refused
to
accept
the
hospitality
of
people
quite
unknown
to
him
why
with
abundant
resources
of
their
own
should
they
become
indebted
to
strangers
so
vehement
was
his
resistance
and
so
pitiful
the
state
of
body
and
mind
which
showed
itself
in
his
all
but
hysterical
excitement
that
sibyl
pretended
to
abandon
the
scheme
today
they
would
remain
here
talking
quietly
by
tomorrow
they
might
have
decided
what
to
do
at
ten
next
morning
when
sibyl
had
been
up
for
an
hour
hugh
still
lay
asleep
she
went
softly
into
the
room
lighted
by
the
yellow
glimmer
through
blind
and
lace
curtains
and
stood
looking
at
him
her
husband
to
him
she
had
given
all
the
love
of
which
she
was
capable
she
had
admired
him
for
his
strength
and
his
spirit
had
liked
him
as
a
companion
had
prized
the
flattery
of
his
ardent
devotion
his
staunch
fidelity
to
have
married
him
was
of
course
a
mistake
not
easy
of
explanation
in
her
present
mind
she
regretted
it
but
with
no
bitterness
with
no
cruel
or
even
unkind
thought
his
haggard
features
branded
with
the
long
rage
of
captivity
his
great
limbs
wasted
to
mere
bone
and
muscle
moved
her
indignant
pity
poor
dear
old
boy
he
believed
her
he
still
believed
her
she
saw
that
these
two
years
of
misery
had
made
his
faith
in
her
something
like
a
religion
he
found
it
his
one
refuge
from
despair
for
that
sibyl
i
should
be
alive
now
she
had
known
now
again
it
touched
her
slightly
passingly
poor
old
boy
but
unfaithful
to
him
to
call
unfaithfulness
the
idea
was
too
foolish
her
fears
were
all
outlived
she
had
dared
the
worst
and
daring
was
grown
an
easy
habit
but
in
the
life
that
lay
before
them
judgment
ambitions
must
prevail
and
direct
yesterday
she
had
no
course
save
yielding
today
her
rule
must
begin
hugh
was
stirring
he
groaned
and
threw
out
one
of
his
arms
muttered
as
if
angrily
she
touched
him
and
on
the
instant
he
awoke
good
god
that
a
queer
thing
i
dreamt
that
yesterday
was
a
dream
and
that
i
had
woke
up
to
find
myself
did
you
ever
do
that
dream
you
were
dreaming
she
stroked
his
head
laughing
playfully
had
a
good
long
night
do
you
feel
better
shall
i
bring
you
some
breakfast
here
i
must
get
up
what
the
time
miles
will
be
coming
sibyl
knew
that
the
major
would
not
be
here
until
two
but
she
said
nothing
and
left
him
to
dress
on
the
were
delicacies
to
tempt
his
palate
but
hugh
turned
from
them
he
ate
for
a
few
minutes
only
without
appetite
and
as
on
the
day
before
sibyl
was
annoyed
by
the
strange
rudeness
with
which
he
fed
himself
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
the
habits
of
refinement
at
table
afterwards
he
lighted
a
cigar
but
soon
threw
it
aside
tobacco
made
him
sick
in
the
he
moved
aimlessly
about
blundering
now
and
then
against
a
piece
of
furniture
and
muttering
a
curse
the
clothes
he
wore
out
of
his
old
wardrobe
hung
loose
about
him
he
had
a
stoop
in
the
shoulders
what
are
we
going
to
do
for
this
she
had
waited
she
sat
looking
at
him
with
a
compassionate
smile
it
was
an
odd
thing
if
this
poor
man
could
not
be
made
subservient
to
her
will
still
think
dear
boy
that
we
ought
to
accept
lady
invitation
a
nervous
paroxysm
shook
him
lady
isobel
i
thought
that
was
done
with
do
think
you
would
speak
of
her
like
that
hugh
if
you
knew
all
her
kindness
to
me
i
could
tell
you
all
yesterday
may
i
now
or
shall
i
only
irritate
you
is
it
of
course
i
do
want
you
to
offend
her
but
i
suppose
she
has
than
most
women
there
no
fear
of
offending
her
i
have
another
reason
come
and
sit
quietly
by
me
and
let
us
talk
as
we
used
to
do
do
you
know
dear
it
a
good
thing
for
me
that
i
had
powerful
friends
i
needed
all
their
help
against
my
enemies
enemies
you
forgotten
what
you
yourself
said
and
felt
so
strongly
at
that
time
what
a
danger
i
was
exposed
to
when
we
determined
to
tell
the
whole
truth
you
knew
what
some
people
would
say
said
it
no
doubt
and
what
harm
has
it
done
you
tell
me
a
name
and
if
it
a
man
i
ca
bear
to
see
that
look
on
your
face
hugh
you
could
do
nothing
but
endless
harm
trying
to
defend
me
that
way
i
have
lived
it
down
thinking
of
you
even
more
than
of
myself
there
was
a
time
when
i
almost
despaired
people
are
so
glad
to
think
evil
if
i
had
been
a
weak
woman
i
should
have
run
away
and
hidden
myself
and
then
everybody
would
have
said
i
told
you
so
but
i
had
to
think
of
you
and
that
gave
me
strength
what
could
i
do
truth
alone
is
no
good
against
the
world
but
truth
with
a
handle
to
its
name
and
with
a
million
of
money
that
a
different
thing
it
was
life
or
death
dear
boy
and
i
had
to
fight
for
it
so
i
went
to
lady
isobel
barker
i
only
knew
her
by
name
she
of
course
knew
by
name
and
cold
enough
she
was
when
i
got
admitted
to
her
but
half
an
hour
talk
and
i
had
won
she
was
my
friend
she
would
stand
by
me
and
all
the
world
should
know
it
stay
the
worst
is
over
but
there
still
a
good
deal
to
be
done
it
has
to
be
known
that
my
friends
are
your
friends
also
there
was
a
paragraph
in
the
papers
yesterday
saying
that
you
and
your
wife
were
going
as
lady
isobel
guests
to
that
house
of
hers
she
did
that
for
me
and
now
do
you
think
we
ought
to
seem
even
seem
to
slight
her
kindness
hugh
was
turning
about
chafing
impotently
you
mean
to
go
on
here
he
asked
with
eyes
sibyl
made
a
gesture
of
entreaty
other
life
is
there
for
me
what
would
you
have
me
do
his
arms
fell
for
a
minute
he
sat
with
head
hanging
his
eyes
fixed
and
blank
like
those
of
a
drunken
man
then
as
if
goaded
suddenly
are
these
enemies
you
talk
about
sibyl
look
wandered
her
lips
moved
in
hesitancy
one
of
them
it
better
to
try
to
forget
them
i
suppose
you
say
you
have
seen
rolfe
has
heard
this
talk
about
you
do
you
think
doubt
she
answered
distantly
he
coming
to
see
you
he
saw
that
in
the
papers
he
wo
think
i
am
here
but
i
should
like
to
see
him
i
a
good
mind
to
telegraph
but
i
do
know
his
address
yes
i
forgot
there
a
letter
from
him
somewhere
know
the
address
said
sibyl
in
the
same
tone
of
reserve
should
like
to
see
old
rolfe
poor
old
rolfe
do
you
pity
him
only
a
way
of
speaking
you
know
the
address
you
say
has
he
written
has
written
no
have
seen
her
sibyl
evaded
the
question
it
seem
to
you
rather
strange
she
said
the
rolfes
should
keep
away
from
me
never
call
or
write
hugh
lips
were
set
when
she
repeated
her
inquiry
more
urgently
he
gave
a
peevish
answer
cared
very
little
about
her
at
the
last
and
rolfe
when
a
man
marries
no
i
wo
see
him
just
yet
i
write
to
him
when
away
would
astonish
you
sibyl
spoke
in
a
thin
voice
not
quite
under
her
control
you
heard
that
rolfe
had
done
her
best
and
her
worst
against
me
against
you
do
know
that
it
matters
you
said
poor
rolfe
i
should
fancy
he
is
poor
in
every
sense
as
i
have
said
so
much
it
better
to
let
you
know
all
it
will
show
you
that
i
am
not
exaggerating
what
i
have
gone
through
people
knew
of
course
that
she
had
called
herself
a
friend
of
mine
and
just
then
she
came
into
notice
just
enough
to
give
her
opportunities
of
being
dangerous
well
i
heard
before
long
that
she
was
slandering
me
to
all
her
acquaintances
oh
knew
all
about
me
it
was
lucky
for
me
i
had
a
credulous
husband
and
it
still
goes
on
she
came
here
not
long
ago
yes
she
came
she
told
me
that
she
knew
i
was
afraid
of
her
and
she
threatened
me
hugh
sat
staring
like
a
paralytic
rolfe
wife
did
this
motive
i
do
know
pure
hatred
it
seemed
but
i
had
a
strange
fancy
she
talked
about
a
woman
i
used
to
know
very
slightly
a
strangeways
and
seemed
to
be
in
fear
of
her
she
said
that
woman
and
i
were
circulating
stories
about
her
and
i
have
wondered
why
are
you
looking
like
that
must
be
i
tell
you
i
only
wish
i
had
told
you
before
she
was
that
night
at
redgrave
but
for
it
would
never
have
happened
i
saw
him
standing
with
her
by
the
window
of
his
room
that
is
i
saw
a
woman
but
it
was
light
enough
to
know
her
and
all
at
once
she
ran
back
through
the
open
french
windows
into
the
house
and
then
i
rushed
in
and
found
her
there
it
was
rolfe
wife
did
you
keep
this
from
me
implored
me
vowed
there
was
nothing
wrong
cried
and
begged
and
i
thought
of
rolfe
i
see
now
that
i
ought
to
have
told
him
the
woman
must
be
crazy
to
have
behaved
like
this
to
you
sibyl
face
shone
i
understand
this
explains
her
oh
my
dear
foolish
husband
after
all
you
did
tell
the
whole
truth
to
spare
your
feelings
you
risked
your
wife
reputation
and
i
have
been
at
the
mercy
of
that
woman
malice
do
you
think
hugh
that
i
have
had
to
bear
a
little
more
than
i
deserved
your
distrust
and
what
came
of
it
i
have
long
forgiven
you
all
that
but
this
was
it
rather
too
hard
upon
me
he
flinched
under
her
soft
reproach
could
be
sure
sibyl
perhaps
it
was
true
perhaps
she
was
only
there
a
flash
of
scorn
from
her
eyes
struck
him
into
silence
and
perhaps
she
meant
no
harm
in
lying
about
me
you
will
send
at
once
for
rolfe
and
tell
him
hugh
moved
from
her
and
stood
with
his
face
averted
you
hesitate
for
a
moment
she
asked
severely
need
i
tell
rolfe
send
for
and
say
what
you
like
that
be
enough
it
awful
to
think
of
telling
rolfe
do
ask
me
do
to
that
sibyl
he
approached
her
voice
and
attitude
broken
to
humility
sibyl
grew
only
more
resolute
must
tell
him
do
you
owe
it
me
god
i
ca
do
that
i
ca
do
that
have
her
here
before
us
both
shame
her
and
threaten
her
as
much
as
you
like
but
do
tell
rolfe
it
like
you
and
me
sibyl
suppose
she
has
really
done
no
wrong
and
we
put
that
thought
into
his
mind
you
lost
all
your
senses
she
exclaimed
passionately
i
keep
reminding
you
what
she
has
done
to
is
a
woman
that
will
behave
in
that
way
likely
to
be
innocent
is
her
husband
to
be
kept
in
the
dark
about
her
deceived
cheated
i
ca
understand
you
if
you
are
too
cowardly
to
do
your
plain
duty
hugh
how
am
i
talking
you
make
me
forget
myself
but
you
know
that
it
impossible
to
spare
your
friend
it
would
be
just
to
him
here
a
form
write
the
telegram
at
once
it
yourself
he
answered
in
a
low
nerveless
voice
moving
away
again
it
was
quickly
done
though
sibyl
paused
to
reflect
after
the
first
word
or
two
the
message
ran
thus
want
to
see
you
and
rolfe
before
going
away
please
both
come
this
evening
if
possible
if
you
can
not
reply
when
without
showing
what
she
had
written
she
left
the
room
and
despatched
a
servant
to
the
chapter
as
a
last
resource
against
cecil
morphew
degeneration
harvey
had
given
up
his
daily
work
in
westminster
bridge
road
shall
go
no
more
he
wrote
am
quite
unable
to
manage
the
business
alone
and
if
you
wo
attend
to
it
it
must
smash
but
please
to
remember
that
i
took
a
share
on
certain
conditions
for
a
week
he
had
stayed
at
home
morphew
did
not
reply
but
the
fact
that
no
appeals
arrived
from
the
trusty
shopman
seemed
to
prove
that
this
last
step
had
been
effectual
this
morning
rolfe
was
to
go
up
to
town
but
decided
that
he
had
better
not
thus
the
telegram
from
oxford
and
cambridge
mansions
came
into
his
hands
at
about
twelve
alma
after
giving
hughie
his
morning
lesson
had
gone
out
with
him
for
an
hour
as
soon
as
she
returned
harvey
showed
her
the
message
does
he
want
both
of
us
to
go
he
asked
uneasily
alma
merely
shook
her
head
as
if
the
matter
interested
her
very
little
and
turned
to
leave
the
room
again
think
i
had
better
go
alone
said
harvey
his
eyes
on
the
telegram
as
you
like
answered
alma
and
withdrew
she
spent
the
afternoon
much
as
usual
rolfe
had
said
at
lunch
that
he
would
go
to
carnaby
immediately
after
dinner
langland
and
one
of
her
daughters
called
they
thought
rolfe
rather
but
noticed
nothing
else
at
she
said
carelessly
to
her
husband
think
i
had
better
go
with
you
as
i
was
asked
no
i
think
not
had
rather
harvey
if
you
do
mind
i
am
quite
ready
shall
only
have
to
put
my
hat
on
he
made
no
further
objection
but
looked
a
little
displeased
and
was
silent
through
the
meal
they
travelled
by
rail
to
edgware
road
exchanging
scarce
a
word
on
the
way
on
the
stairs
of
the
mansions
alma
found
the
ascent
too
much
for
her
she
stopped
and
put
out
a
hand
to
support
herself
rolfe
looked
round
you
have
made
me
walk
rather
quickly
sorry
rest
a
moment
but
alma
hastened
upwards
they
were
shown
at
once
into
the
where
carnaby
who
was
sitting
alone
rose
at
the
announcement
of
their
names
alma
stepped
forwards
and
seemed
about
to
offer
her
hand
but
she
was
disregarded
their
hostess
stood
with
her
eyes
on
rolfe
who
observing
the
strangeness
of
this
reception
bowed
and
said
nothing
was
i
who
sent
the
telegram
mr
rolfe
sibyl
voice
had
its
wonted
refinement
and
hardly
disturbed
the
silence
husband
would
have
postponed
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
but
i
thought
it
better
you
should
meet
him
at
once
her
finger
touched
an
electric
bell
i
particularly
wished
rolfe
to
be
with
you
i
am
so
glad
she
was
able
to
come
pray
sit
down
harvey
with
no
thought
of
accepting
this
invitation
cast
stern
glances
at
the
speaker
and
at
his
wife
does
all
this
mean
mrs
carnaby
old
friend
will
tell
you
the
door
had
opened
and
hugh
carnaby
slouched
in
at
the
sight
of
alma
he
stood
still
then
meeting
harvey
eyes
he
exclaimed
with
hoarse
indistinctness
each
advanced
and
their
hands
clasped
old
fellow
i
the
most
miserable
devil
on
earth
tears
were
in
his
eyes
and
in
his
voice
he
held
harvey
hand
tight
prisoned
in
both
his
own
and
stood
tottering
like
a
feeble
old
man
friend
i
ca
help
myself
do
feel
hard
against
me
i
have
to
tell
you
something
he
looked
towards
alma
who
was
motionless
sibyl
had
sat
down
and
watched
as
at
a
play
but
with
no
smile
into
the
next
room
with
me
added
the
choking
voice
here
if
you
please
hugh
sounded
with
gentle
firmness
then
tell
it
i
ca
a
simple
story
rolfe
began
sibyl
am
sure
you
are
not
aware
that
rolfe
ever
since
our
great
misfortune
has
lost
no
opportunity
of
slandering
me
she
has
told
people
in
plain
words
that
she
knew
me
to
be
guilty
of
what
my
husband
was
for
a
moment
trapped
into
suspecting
among
others
she
told
it
to
her
friend
miss
leach
not
long
ago
she
went
so
far
as
to
call
upon
me
here
and
accuse
me
to
my
face
telling
me
i
was
afraid
of
what
she
knew
against
me
i
have
thought
of
taking
legal
measures
to
protect
myself
perhaps
i
shall
still
do
so
today
something
has
come
to
my
knowledge
which
possibly
explains
rolfe
singular
malice
my
husband
tells
me
and
it
a
sad
pity
he
kept
it
a
secret
so
long
that
there
was
a
third
person
present
that
evening
when
he
came
upon
redgrave
i
dare
say
you
remember
the
details
of
the
story
told
in
court
all
was
perfectly
true
but
my
husband
should
have
added
that
a
woman
was
with
redgrave
talking
alone
with
him
in
the
dark
and
when
the
blow
had
been
struck
this
woman
who
had
quickly
disappeared
from
the
veranda
into
the
house
was
found
to
be
mrs
rolfe
hugh
hand
had
fallen
on
to
his
friend
shoulder
he
spoke
as
soon
as
sibyl
ceased
said
she
had
done
no
wrong
i
had
no
proof
of
any
no
proof
whatever
rolfe
was
looking
at
alma
she
through
the
unimpassioned
arraignment
stood
with
eyes
fixed
upon
her
enemy
rather
as
if
lost
in
thought
than
listening
her
mouth
was
tortured
into
a
smile
her
forehead
had
the
lines
of
age
and
misery
at
the
sound
of
hugh
voice
she
turned
to
him
and
spoke
like
one
recovering
consciousness
have
told
the
truth
did
you
compel
me
to
make
this
known
mrs
rolfe
that
quite
a
mistake
it
was
she
who
made
you
tell
it
as
she
will
make
you
do
anything
and
believe
anything
she
likes
i
can
imagine
how
delighted
she
was
but
it
does
matter
if
you
care
to
know
it
either
of
you
she
included
carnaby
and
her
husband
in
one
glance
as
equally
remote
from
her
have
gone
about
seeking
to
injure
her
perhaps
i
let
one
or
two
people
know
what
i
thought
but
they
had
heard
the
truth
already
it
was
prudent
and
it
was
a
right
return
for
the
kindness
you
had
shown
me
carnaby
but
not
sure
that
i
should
have
done
better
in
helping
to
deceive
you
has
she
anything
more
to
say
if
not
i
will
leave
you
to
talk
about
it
the
tone
of
this
speech
so
indifferent
that
it
seemed
struck
the
hearers
mute
rolfe
speaking
for
the
first
time
since
hugh
entrance
said
at
length
with
troubled
sternness
you
have
repeated
your
charge
against
carnaby
what
grounds
have
you
for
it
she
looked
at
him
with
a
vague
smile
but
did
not
answer
you
do
make
an
accusation
of
this
kind
without
some
proof
the
cry
quivered
on
a
laugh
harvey
who
would
know
you
with
that
face
sibyl
rose
the
men
exchanged
a
quick
glance
rolfe
moved
to
his
side
and
touched
her
yes
i
she
went
on
drawing
away
know
what
you
asked
me
keep
quiet
just
a
little
there
are
three
of
you
and
it
hard
for
me
alone
it
is
so
easy
to
make
believe
things
harvey
of
course
i
knew
how
it
would
be
if
this
came
out
i
can
tell
you
but
not
now
some
other
time
when
we
are
alone
you
wo
believe
me
i
always
knew
should
be
believed
i
ought
to
have
been
cautious
and
have
kept
friends
with
her
but
it
was
as
if
i
had
anything
to
hide
anything
that
mattered
let
me
go
and
leave
you
three
to
talk
and
when
you
come
home
turning
looking
for
the
door
she
fell
softly
on
to
her
knees
in
a
moment
harvey
had
raised
her
and
seated
her
in
the
chair
which
hugh
pushed
forward
sibyl
motionless
looked
on
seeing
that
alma
had
not
lost
consciousness
she
awaited
her
next
word
will
go
away
said
hugh
under
his
breath
and
he
beckoned
to
sibyl
reluctantly
she
took
a
step
towards
him
but
was
stopped
by
alma
voice
go
on
my
account
have
any
question
to
ask
me
when
i
go
i
sha
be
anxious
to
see
you
again
do
look
frightened
i
know
what
i
am
talking
about
my
head
went
round
for
a
moment
and
no
wonder
stand
there
face
to
leave
me
alone
harvey
i
can
stand
very
well
i
want
her
to
ask
me
anything
she
has
to
ask
it
her
only
chance
now
i
wo
see
her
again
never
after
this
carnaby
said
rolfe
must
be
an
end
of
it
you
had
better
ask
alma
what
she
has
against
you
sibyl
summoning
all
her
cold
dignity
stood
before
the
woman
and
looked
her
in
the
eyes
harm
or
wrong
have
i
done
you
rolfe
that
you
hate
me
so
that
i
know
of
until
you
brought
me
here
today
you
have
said
that
you
think
me
no
better
than
a
guilty
hypocrite
and
is
it
natural
that
i
should
defend
myself
natural
you
have
done
it
very
cleverly
till
now
and
perhaps
you
will
to
the
end
i
feel
sure
there
is
no
evidence
against
you
except
the
word
of
the
woman
who
told
your
husband
and
even
if
she
comes
forward
you
have
only
to
deny
and
keep
on
denying
why
do
you
believe
that
woman
rather
than
me
alma
answered
only
with
a
frivolous
laugh
sibyl
turning
her
head
looked
an
appeal
to
the
listeners
rolfe
said
hugh
in
a
rough
imploring
voice
you
no
other
answer
you
ca
ruin
people
lives
like
this
as
if
it
were
sport
to
you
alma
gazed
at
him
as
if
she
had
but
just
observed
his
face
have
gone
through
dreadful
things
she
said
earnestly
sorry
to
cause
you
more
trouble
but
the
fault
is
hers
she
got
that
secret
from
you
and
it
delighted
her
go
on
believing
what
she
says
it
the
best
way
when
all
over
and
done
with
you
can
never
know
as
do
she
laughed
again
a
little
spurt
of
joyless
merriment
upon
that
in
the
same
moment
followed
a
loud
hysterical
cry
then
sobs
and
wailing
with
movements
as
if
to
tear
open
the
clothing
that
choked
her
sibyl
hastened
away
and
returned
with
her
vinaigrette
which
she
handed
to
rolfe
but
already
the
crisis
was
over
alma
lay
back
in
a
chair
sobbing
quietly
with
head
bent
aside
carnaby
and
his
wife
after
an
exchange
of
signals
silently
left
the
room
rolfe
paced
backwards
and
forwards
for
a
minute
or
two
until
he
heard
his
name
spoken
then
he
drew
near
and
alma
looked
at
him
with
her
own
eyes
once
more
wo
go
back
home
unless
you
wish
harvey
you
feel
able
to
go
you
wish
me
if
not
i
go
somewhere
else
he
sat
down
by
her
you
yourself
alma
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
indeed
i
do
i
know
i
lost
myself
my
head
went
round
but
i
am
well
again
now
tell
me
in
a
word
is
there
any
reason
why
you
should
go
home
with
me
the
use
you
wo
believe
me
you
ca
believe
me
he
grasped
her
hand
and
spoke
imperatively
but
not
unkindly
that
answer
me
and
i
will
believe
what
you
say
is
no
reason
i
have
done
no
wrong
come
if
you
feel
able
to
she
rose
without
help
and
walked
to
a
mirror
at
which
she
arranged
her
dress
harvey
opened
the
door
and
found
all
quiet
he
led
her
through
the
passage
out
into
the
common
staircase
and
down
into
the
street
here
she
whispered
to
him
that
a
faintness
was
upon
her
it
would
pass
if
she
could
have
some
restorative
they
found
a
cab
and
drove
to
a
where
rolfe
obtained
brandy
and
brought
it
out
to
her
then
wishing
to
avoid
the
railway
station
until
alma
had
recovered
her
strength
he
bade
the
cabman
drive
on
to
notting
hill
gate
i
sit
at
your
side
she
asked
bending
towards
him
in
the
darkness
when
they
had
been
silent
for
a
few
minutes
harvey
replied
by
changing
his
own
place
want
to
tell
you
she
resumed
her
face
near
to
his
ca
wait
and
know
you
are
thinking
about
me
there
is
much
to
tell
are
you
sure
you
can
believe
me
have
promised
that
i
will
do
ask
you
to
be
kind
or
to
love
me
you
will
never
love
me
again
only
believe
that
i
tell
the
truth
that
all
i
am
not
like
that
woman
me
he
urged
impatiently
wanted
to
make
use
of
redgrave
to
use
his
influence
with
people
in
society
so
that
i
could
have
a
great
success
i
knew
he
was
to
be
trusted
but
i
had
no
fear
i
could
trust
myself
i
never
said
or
did
anything
it
was
only
meeting
him
at
people
houses
and
at
concerts
and
telling
him
what
i
hoped
for
you
could
take
any
interest
in
my
music
and
you
had
no
faith
in
my
power
to
make
a
success
i
wanted
to
show
you
that
you
were
wrong
was
wrong
in
more
ways
than
one
said
harvey
could
help
it
if
you
had
tried
to
make
me
go
another
way
it
would
only
have
led
to
unhappiness
at
that
time
i
was
mad
to
make
my
name
known
and
though
i
loved
you
i
believe
i
could
have
left
you
rather
than
give
up
my
ambition
redgrave
used
to
invite
people
to
his
house
in
the
summer
to
afternoon
tea
and
i
went
there
once
with
a
lady
other
people
as
well
a
lot
of
other
people
that
how
i
knew
the
house
i
was
never
there
alone
until
that
last
shrink
away
from
me
did
go
on
and
be
quick
suspected
sibyl
from
the
moment
you
told
me
about
her
husband
and
mr
redgrave
you
did
too
harvey
her
aside
it
was
because
of
her
i
saw
she
was
getting
to
dislike
me
and
i
thought
she
knew
redgrave
was
doing
his
best
for
me
and
that
she
was
jealous
and
would
prevent
him
do
you
understand
he
was
my
friend
nothing
else
but
would
never
believe
that
and
a
few
days
before
my
recital
he
seemed
to
lose
interest
and
i
thought
it
was
her
doing
can
you
understand
how
i
felt
not
jealousy
for
i
never
even
liked
him
i
was
living
only
for
the
hope
of
a
success
do
you
believe
me
harvey
enough
thereupon
she
related
truly
without
omission
the
train
of
circumstances
that
brought
her
to
wimbledon
on
the
fatal
night
and
all
that
happened
until
she
fled
away
into
the
darkness
would
be
silly
to
say
i
ought
to
have
gone
there
of
course
i
knew
all
i
was
risking
but
i
felt
i
could
give
my
life
to
detect
that
woman
and
have
her
in
my
power
just
that
i
do
understand
if
it
had
been
ordinary
jealousy
why
of
course
never
can
understand
why
women
hate
each
other
she
thought
herself
so
superior
to
me
and
showed
it
in
every
look
and
word
and
all
the
time
i
knew
she
was
a
wicked
hypocrite
did
you
know
that
rolfe
broke
in
vehemently
staring
into
her
white
face
as
a
ray
from
the
street
illumined
it
i
ca
tell
you
she
replied
in
a
moaning
quivering
voice
knew
it
i
knew
it
something
told
me
but
i
do
ask
you
to
believe
that
only
about
myself
can
you
believe
about
myself
he
replied
mechanically
alma
with
a
sigh
as
much
of
hopelessness
as
of
relief
lay
back
and
said
no
more
at
notting
hill
gate
they
waited
for
a
train
alma
wandered
about
the
platform
her
head
bent
silent
and
heeding
nothing
in
the
railway
carriage
she
closed
her
eyes
and
harvey
had
to
draw
her
attention
when
it
was
time
to
alight
on
entering
the
house
she
went
at
once
upstairs
harvey
loitered
about
below
and
presently
sat
down
in
the
study
leaving
the
door
ajar
he
was
trying
to
persuade
himself
that
nothing
of
much
moment
had
come
to
pass
a
doubt
troubled
him
most
likely
it
would
trouble
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
he
must
heed
it
as
little
as
possible
what
other
course
was
open
to
a
sensible
man
to
rave
and
swear
in
the
high
tragic
style
would
avail
nothing
one
way
or
the
other
and
the
fact
was
whatever
its
explanation
that
he
felt
no
prompting
to
such
violence
two
years
had
passed
the
man
was
dead
alma
had
changed
greatly
and
was
looking
to
new
life
in
new
conditions
his
worst
uneasiness
arose
from
the
hysteria
which
had
so
alarmingly
declared
itself
this
evening
he
thought
of
bennet
frothingham
and
at
length
rose
from
his
chair
meaning
to
go
upstairs
but
just
then
a
step
sounded
in
the
hall
his
door
was
pushed
open
and
alma
showed
herself
i
come
she
asked
looking
at
him
steadily
he
beckoned
with
his
head
she
closed
the
door
and
came
slowly
forward
stopping
at
a
few
paces
from
him
want
you
to
decide
tonight
if
you
think
it
would
be
better
for
both
of
us
let
me
go
i
should
part
from
you
unkindly
i
do
mean
that
i
should
ask
you
to
let
me
have
money
as
long
as
i
needed
it
but
you
know
that
i
could
support
myself
very
soon
if
you
think
it
better
do
say
so
and
we
talk
about
it
as
friends
do
think
anything
of
the
kind
i
should
let
you
go
say
what
you
might
would
but
if
you
find
that
you
believe
me
would
make
no
difference
even
that
but
i
do
believe
you
she
drew
nearer
looking
wistfully
into
his
face
has
made
her
husband
believe
her
you
will
always
think
of
that
always
must
remember
alma
that
i
have
no
serious
reason
for
doubting
her
word
she
uttered
a
cry
of
distress
you
doubt
mine
you
doubt
mine
dear
do
try
to
think
and
talk
more
reasonably
what
is
it
to
you
and
me
whether
she
was
guilty
or
not
i
may
doubt
your
judgment
about
her
and
yet
believe
perfectly
all
you
tell
me
about
yourself
you
think
i
have
slandered
her
no
earthly
use
in
talking
about
it
you
can
give
no
reasons
you
no
reasons
your
suspicion
may
be
right
or
wrong
i
care
the
toss
of
a
button
all
i
know
is
that
we
must
talk
of
it
sit
down
and
be
quiet
for
a
little
ought
you
to
eat
something
before
you
go
up
alma
put
her
hands
upon
his
shoulders
bending
her
face
so
as
to
hide
it
from
him
if
you
could
just
say
that
you
believe
me
not
about
myself
i
know
you
do
but
about
could
you
say
that
he
hesitated
all
a
man
in
revolt
against
the
entreaty
but
he
saw
her
quiver
with
a
sob
and
yielded
well
i
will
believe
that
too
her
touch
became
an
embrace
gentle
and
timid
she
threw
her
head
back
gazing
at
him
in
rapture
will
never
again
doubt
it
again
you
are
good
you
are
kind
to
me
dear
and
will
you
love
me
a
little
do
you
think
you
can
just
a
little
his
answer
satisfied
her
and
she
lay
in
his
arms
shedding
tears
of
contentment
then
for
a
long
time
she
talked
of
the
new
life
before
them
she
would
be
everything
he
wished
no
moment
trouble
should
ever
again
come
between
him
and
her
nothing
now
had
any
charm
for
her
but
the
still
happy
life
of
home
her
ambitions
were
all
dead
and
buried
and
harvey
answered
her
with
tenderness
forgetting
the
doubt
refusing
to
look
forward
knowing
only
that
alma
had
a
place
for
ever
in
his
heart
tonight
she
must
sleep
whilst
undressing
she
measured
the
familiar
draught
of
oblivion
and
said
to
herself
last
time
she
lay
down
in
darkness
closed
her
eyes
and
tried
to
think
only
of
happy
things
but
sleep
would
not
come
and
quiet
thoughts
would
not
linger
with
her
more
than
an
hour
must
have
passed
when
she
heard
harvey
come
upstairs
his
step
paused
near
her
door
and
she
raised
herself
listening
he
went
on
and
his
own
door
closed
then
for
a
short
time
she
lost
herself
but
in
no
placid
slumber
startled
to
wakefulness
she
found
that
she
had
left
her
bed
and
was
sitting
on
the
chair
beside
it
she
felt
for
the
matches
and
lit
a
candle
a
great
anguish
of
mind
came
upon
her
but
she
could
not
shed
tears
she
wished
to
escape
from
her
room
to
harvey
but
durst
not
look
out
into
the
dark
passage
when
her
heart
grew
quieter
she
went
again
to
the
drawer
in
which
she
kept
her
remedy
for
insomnia
saying
to
herself
last
time
i
shall
be
well
again
after
tomorrow
she
measured
another
dose
a
larger
and
drank
it
off
trembling
now
with
cold
she
crept
into
bed
again
and
lay
watching
the
half
an
hour
after
this
it
was
about
two
the
handle
of
her
door
was
turned
and
rolfe
quietly
looked
in
he
had
awoke
with
an
anxious
feeling
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
alma
voice
on
the
borderland
of
dream
calling
his
name
but
alma
lay
asleep
breathing
steadily
her
face
turned
from
the
light
as
the
candle
had
nearly
burnt
down
he
blew
it
out
and
went
back
to
his
bed
at
breakfast
time
alma
did
not
appear
the
housemaid
said
that
half
an
hour
ago
she
was
still
sleeping
when
he
had
had
his
meal
with
hughie
rolfe
went
up
and
entered
his
wife
room
alma
lay
just
as
he
had
seen
her
in
the
night
he
looked
close
laid
his
hand
upon
her
a
violent
ringing
of
the
bedroom
bell
brought
up
the
servant
harvey
met
her
at
the
door
and
bade
her
run
instantly
to
the
doctor
house
which
was
quite
near
the
doctor
could
only
say
warned
her
chapter
umbra
praeterit
the
dial
on
the
front
of
the
old
house
was
just
shadowing
four
harvey
rolfe
and
his
friend
morton
sat
on
the
lawn
harvey
reading
aloud
from
a
small
volume
which
he
had
slipped
into
his
pocket
before
walking
over
this
afternoon
from
another
part
of
the
garden
sounded
young
voices
musical
in
their
merriment
it
was
a
little
book
called
ballads
harvey
read
in
it
here
and
there
with
no
stinted
expression

the

made

cried
rolfe
at

no
use
he
stamps
down
one
prejudice
what
it
the
voice
of
the
reaction
millions
of
men
natural
men
revolting
against
the
softness
and
sweetness
of
civilisation
men
all
over
the
world
hardly
knowing
what
they
want
and
what
they
do
want
and
here
comes
one
who
speaks
for
them

vengeance

for

brute
savagery

how

it

wars
since
then

has
seen
only
sputterings
of
temper
mankind
stand
it
much
longer
this
encroachment
of
the
humane
spirit
see
the
spread
of
athletics
we
must
look
to
our
physique
and
make
ourselves
ready
those
lancashire
operatives
laming
and
killing
each
other

football
turning
a

into

battle
for
the

tennis

tomorrow
they
be

by

they
must
breed
a
stouter
race
we
may
reasonably
hope
old
man
to
see
our
boys
blown
into
small
bits
by
the
explosive
that
has
got
its
name
yet
replied
morton
meditatively
yet
there
are
considerable
forces
on
the
other
side
the
philosopher
sitting
on
the
he
has
breadth
of
beam
good
sedentary
man
but
when
the
moment
comes
the
empire
beginning
to
mean
something
the
average
englander
has
never
grasped
the
fact
that
there
was
such
a
thing
as
a
british
empire
beginning
to
learn
it
and
itches
to
kick
somebody
to
prove
his
imperialism
the
bully
of
the
shouting
jingo
had
his
special
audience
now
comes
a
man
of
genius
and
decent
folk
do
feel
ashamed
to
listen
this
time
we
begin
to
feel
our
position
we
make
money
quite
so
easily
as
we
used
to
scoundrels
in
germany
and
elsewhere
have
dared
to
learn
the
trick
of
commerce
we
feel
sore
and
it
a
great
relief
to
have
our
advantages
pointed
out
to
us
by
god
we
are
the
british
empire
and
we
just
show
what
means
reading
the
campaigns
of
belisarius
said
morton
after
a
pause
has
that
to
do
with
it
heaven
nothing
whatever
bore
you
said
harvey
laughing
i
read
little
or
nothing
except
what
i
can
use
for
hughie
we
doing
the
geography
of
asia
and
i
try
to
give
him
a
few
clear
notions
do
you
remember
the
idiotic
way
in
which
they
used
to
teach
us
geography
i
loathed
the
that
reminds
me
henrietta
winter
is
dead
she
how
did
it
remind
you
because
morphew
is
going
to
new
zealand
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
here
it
is
i
heard
yesterday
that
is
dead
she
died
a
fortnight
ago
and
a
letter
from
her
mother
has
only
just
reached
me
in
a
roundabout
way
she
had
been
ailing
for
some
time
they
suspected
drains
and
had
workmen
in
with
assurance
that
all
had
been
put
right
since
death
the
drains
have
again
been
examined
and
it
was
found
that
the
men
who
came
before
so
bungled
and
scamped
their
work
that
an
abominable
state
of
things
was
made
much
worse
those
fellows
will
shout
nobly
for
the
empire
one
of
these
days
i
never
saw
her
but
she
spoke
of
me
just
before
the
end
spoke
very
kindly
says
her
mother
damnation
i
can
write
no
more
about
it
i
know
you
do
care
to
hear
from
me
but
i
just
say
that
i
going
out
to
new
zealand
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
there
but
a
fellow
has
asked
me
to
go
with
him
and
it
better
than
rotting
here
it
may
help
me
to
escape
the
devil
yet
if
so
you
shall
hear
goodbye
he
thrust
the
letter
back
into
his
pocket
rather
thought
the
end
would
be
pyrogallic
acid
has
the
good
sense
to
prefer
ozone
said
morton
a
time
at
all
look
behind
you
the
young
rascal
is
creeping
this
way
he
rather
sit
and
listen
to
our
talk
than
be
with
the
other
youngsters
that
wrong
you
know
morton
look
round
and
saw
hugh
rolfe
seven
years
old
now
slight
and
with
little
or
no
colour
in
his
cheeks
a
wistful
timid
smile
on
the
too
intelligent
face
he
was
gazing
towards
his
father
and
evidently
wished
to
draw
near
yet
feared
that
his
presence
might
not
be
welcome
morton
beckoned
him
and
at
once
he
ran
and
threw
himself
upon
the
grass
by
his
father
side
of
playing
asked
harvey
with
voice
and
look
which
betrayed
a
tenderness
he
was
always
trying
to
conceal
little
tired
we
are
going
to
have
tea
may
i
look
at
this
book
father
pictures
do
yes
there
a
picture
a
soldier
interest
quickened
in
the
boy
eyes
and
he
turned
eagerly
from
to
text
but
just
then
there
came
a
loud
calling
of
his
name
from
the
other
end
of
the
garden
want
you
said
harvey
you
go
you
can
have
the
book
another
time
hughie
obeyed
without
hesitation
but
his
face
had
a
weary
look
as
he
walked
away
to
join
the
other
children
must
send
him
to
the
next
year
said
rolfe
wo
do
he
must
be
among
boys
and
learn
to
be
noisy
perhaps
i
have
been
altogether
wrong
in
teaching
him
myself
what
right
has
a
man
to
teach
who
ca
make
up
his
mind
on
any
subject
of
thought
of
course
i
do
talk
to
about
my
waverings
and
doubtings
but
probably
they
affect
him
bother
your
head
so
much
about
it
replied
morton
be
all
right
as
he
grows
stronger
a
servant
had
brought
out
two
little
tables
tea
was
going
to
be
served
in
the
garden
when
it
was
ready
morton
appeared
the
men
rose
as
she
came
towards
them
a
newspaper
in
her
hand
you
noticed
this
she
asked
of
rolfe
with
a
smile
pointing
out
a
paragraph
to
him
he
read
it
first
to
himself
then
aloud
at
lady
isobel
barker
house
in
pont
street
a
meeting
was
held
of
ladies
interested
in
a
project
for
the
benefit
of
women
in
the
west
end
it
is
proposed
to
arrange
for
a
series
of
lectures
specially
adapted
to
such
an
audience
on
subjects
of
literary
and
artistic
interest
unfortunately
lady
isobel
herself
was
unable
to
take
part
in
the
proceedings
owing
to
sudden
indisposition
but
her
views
were
most
suggestively
set
forth
by
hugh
carnaby
who
dwelt
on
the
monotony
of
the
lives
of
decent
women
and
showed
how
much
they
would
be
benefited
by
being
brought
into
touch
with
the
intellectual
movements
of
the
day
practical
details
of
the
scheme
will
shortly
be
made
public
morton
chuckled
quietly
idea
said
rolfe
who
knows
anything
of
the
west
end
woman
will
be
sure
to
give
it
warm
support
the
rang
the
children
came
running
morton
eldest
boy
who
had
been
busy
in
his
workshop
exhibited
a
fine
model
schooner
just
finished
presently
the
hostess
asked
rolfe
whether
he
had
heard
of
late
from
carnaby
week
ago
the
first
time
for
a
year
the
demand
for
shares
in
their
company
was
tremendous
and
they
are
turning
out
the
new
bicycle
at
the
rate
of
hundreds
a
week
he
quite
got
over
that
illness
he
suffers
much
from
dyspepsia
otherwise
fairly
well
the
prospect
of
on
a
great
scale
seems
pleasant
to
him
carnaby
also
i
dare
say
doubt
replied
rolfe
absently
after
tea
a
trio
of
little
singers
one
of
whom
was
hughie
gave
the
songs
they
had
newly
learnt
with
morton
she
accompanying
them
on
the
piano
rolfe
sat
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
listened
as
always
with
keen
pleasure
more
he
asked
when
they
were
about
to
cease
they
sang
that
which
he
liked
best
fear
no
more
the
heat
o
the
sun
after
it
there
came
a
minute
silence
then
harvey
rose
goodbye
hughie
we
must
be
going
home
hand
in
hand
each
thinking
his
own
thoughts
they
walked
homeward
through
the
evening
sunshine
