october
tuesday
evening
fog
that
you
might
cut
with
a
knife
all
the
way
from
london
to
newbury
this
fog
does
not
things
it
is
rather
a
than
a
fog
there
are
no
two
things
in
and
were
it
not
for
fear
of
the
wholesome
restraint
of
which
i
continually
feel
i
might
be
tempted
to
carry
my
comparison
further
but
certainly
there
are
no
two
things
in
so
dissimilar
as
an
english
and
a
long
island
these
fogs
are
certainly
the
that
we
sometimes
see
aloft
i
was
once
upon
the
hampshire
hills
going
from
soberton
down
to
petersfield
where
the
hills
are
high
and
steep
not
very
wide
at
their
base
very
irregular
in
their
form
and
direction
and
have
of
course
deep
and
narrow
valleys
winding
about
between
them
in
one
place
that
i
had
to
pass
two
of
these
valleys
were
cut
asunder
by
a
piece
of
hill
that
went
across
them
and
formed
a
sort
of
bridge
from
one
long
hill
to
another
a
little
before
i
came
to
this
sort
of
bridge
i
saw
a
smoke
flying
across
it
and
not
knowing
the
way
by
experience
i
said
to
the
person
who
was
with
me
there
is
the
turnpike
road
which
we
were
expecting
to
come
to
for
do
you
see
the
dust
the
day
was
very
fine
the
sun
clear
and
the
weather
dry
when
we
came
to
the
pass
however
we
found
ourselves
not
in
dust
but
in
a
fog
after
getting
over
the
pass
we
looked
down
into
the
valleys
and
there
we
saw
the
fog
going
along
the
valleys
to
the
north
in
detached
parcels
that
is
to
say
in
clouds
and
as
they
came
to
the
pass
they
rose
went
over
it
then
descended
again
keeping
constantly
along
just
above
the
ground
and
the
fog
came
by
it
was
sometimes
thinner
than
at
other
times
and
these
changes
were
very
sudden
too
so
that
i
am
convinced
that
these
fogs
are
such
as
those
that
i
saw
on
the
hampshire
downs
those
did
not
me
at
all
nor
do
these
fogs
wet
any
thing
and
i
do
not
think
that
they
are
by
any
means
injurious
to
it
is
the
fogs
that
rise
out
of
swamps
and
other
places
full
of
putrid
vegetable
matter
that
kill
people
these
are
the
fogs
that
sweep
off
the
new
settlers
in
the
american
woods
i
remember
a
valley
in
pennsylvania
in
a
part
called
in
looking
from
a
hill
over
this
valley
early
in
the
morning
in
november
it
presented
one
of
the
most
beautiful
sights
that
my
eyes
ever
beheld
it
was
a
sea
bordered
with
beautifully
formed
trees
of
endless
variety
of
colours
as
the
hills
formed
the
outsides
of
the
sea
some
of
the
trees
showed
only
their
tops
and
every
a
lofty
tree
growing
in
the
sea
itself
raised
its
head
above
the
apparent
waters
except
the
sending
his
horizontal
beams
through
all
the
variety
of
reds
and
yellows
of
the
branches
of
the
trees
in
long
island
and
giving
at
the
same
time
a
sort
of
silver
cast
to
the
verdure
beneath
them
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
beautiful
as
the
foggy
valley
of
the
wysihicken
but
i
was
told
that
it
was
very
fatal
to
the
people
and
that
whole
families
were
frequently
swept
off
by
the
thus
the
has
a
great
deal
to
do
with
health
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
butchers
and
their
wives
fatten
upon
the
smell
of
meat
and
this
accounts
for
the
precept
of
my
grandmother
who
used
to
tell
me
to
my
bread
and
smell
to
my
talk
much
more
wise
than
that
of
certain
who
go
about
england
crying
up
the
of
taxes
and
national
debts
the
fog
prevented
me
from
seeing
much
of
the
fields
as
i
came
along
yesterday
but
the
fields
of
swedish
turnips
that
i
did
see
were
good
pretty
good
though
not
clean
and
neat
like
those
in
norfolk
the
farmers
here
as
every
where
else
complain
most
bitterly
but
they
hang
on
like
sailors
to
the
masts
or
hull
of
a
wreck
they
read
you
will
observe
nothing
but
the
country
newspapers
they
of
course
know
nothing
of
the
of
their
bad
times
they
hope
the
times
will
mend
if
they
quit
business
they
must
sell
their
stock
and
having
thought
this
worth
so
much
money
they
can
not
endure
the
thought
of
selling
for
a
third
of
the
sum
thus
they
hang
on
thus
the
landlords
will
first
turn
the
farmers
pockets
inside
out
and
then
their
turn
comes
to
finish
the
present
farmers
will
not
take
long
there
has
been
stout
fight
going
on
all
this
morning
it
is
now
between
the
and
the
i
have
backed
the
former
and
he
appears
to
have
gained
the
day
for
he
is
now
shining
most
delightfully
came
through
a
place
called
a
park
belonging
to
a
montague
who
is
now
for
the
purpose
i
suppose
of
generously
assisting
to
compensate
the
french
people
for
what
they
lost
by
the
entrance
of
the
holy
alliance
armies
into
their
country
of
all
the
ridiculous
things
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
this
place
is
the
most
ridiculous
the
house
looks
like
a
sort
of
church
in
somewhat
of
a
gothic
style
of
building
with
on
the
tops
of
different
parts
of
the
pile
there
is
a
sort
of
swamp
at
the
foot
of
a
wood
at
no
great
distance
from
the
front
of
the
house
this
swamp
has
been
dug
out
in
the
middle
to
show
the
water
to
the
eye
so
that
there
is
a
sort
of
river
or
chain
of
diminutive
lakes
going
down
a
little
valley
about
yards
long
the
water
proceeding
from
the
of
the
higher
ground
on
both
sides
by
the
sides
of
these
lakes
there
are
little
flower
gardens
laid
out
in
the
dutch
manner
that
is
to
say
cut
out
into
all
manner
of
superficial
geometrical
figures
here
is
the
en
or
mock
magnificence
more
complete
than
i
ever
beheld
it
before
here
is
a
the
basin
of
which
is
not
four
feet
over
and
the
water
spout
not
exceeding
the
pour
from
a
here
is
a
over
a
of
which
a
child
four
years
old
would
clear
the
banks
at
a
jump
i
could
not
have
trusted
myself
on
the
bridge
for
fear
of
the
consequences
to
montague
but
i
very
conveniently
stepped
over
the
river
in
imitation
of
the
in
another
part
there
was
a
spouting
out
water
into
the
lake
which
was
so
much
like
the
vomiting
of
a
dog
that
i
could
almost
have
pitied
the
poor
lion
in
short
such
fooleries
i
never
before
beheld
but
what
i
disliked
most
was
the
apparent
impiety
of
a
part
of
these
works
of
refined
taste
i
did
not
like
the
crosses
on
the
dwelling
house
but
in
one
of
the
gravel
walks
we
had
to
pass
under
a
gothic
arch
with
a
cross
on
the
top
of
it
and
in
the
point
of
the
arch
a
niche
for
a
saint
or
a
virgin
the
figure
being
gone
through
the
lapse
of
centuries
and
the
pedestal
only
remaining
as
we
so
frequently
see
on
the
outsides
of
cathedrals
and
of
old
churches
and
chapels
but
the
good
of
it
was
this
gothic
arch
disfigured
by
the
hand
of
old
father
time
was
composed
of
scotch
fir
wood
as
rotten
as
a
pear
nailed
together
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
the
thing
appear
from
a
distance
like
the
remnant
of
a
ruin
i
wonder
how
long
this
sickly
this
childish
taste
is
to
remain
i
do
not
know
who
this
gentleman
is
i
suppose
he
is
some
honest
person
from
the
or
its
neighbourhood
and
that
these
are
to
denote
the
of
his
not
a
bad
plan
and
indeed
it
is
one
that
i
once
took
the
liberty
to
recommend
to
those
fundlords
who
retire
to
be
but
i
never
recommended
the
to
be
sure
the
roman
catholic
religion
may
in
england
be
considered
as
a
it
being
the
most
in
the
country
and
therefore
it
is
fortunate
for
a
fundlord
when
he
happens
if
he
ever
do
happen
to
be
of
that
faith
this
gentleman
may
for
anything
that
i
know
be
a
in
which
case
i
applaud
his
piety
and
pity
his
taste
at
the
end
of
this
scene
of
mock
grandeur
and
mock
antiquity
i
found
something
more
rational
namely
some
hare
hounds
and
in
half
an
hour
after
we
found
and
i
had
the
first
that
i
had
had
since
i
wore
a
we
killed
our
hare
after
good
sport
and
got
to
berghclere
in
the
evening
to
a
nice
in
a
dell
sheltered
from
every
wind
and
with
plenty
of
good
living
though
with
no
gothic
arches
made
of
scotch
fir
a
fine
day
too
many
hares
here
but
our
hunting
was
not
bad
or
at
least
it
was
a
great
treat
to
me
who
used
when
a
boy
to
have
my
legs
and
thighs
so
often
filled
with
thorns
in
running
after
the
hounds
anticipating
with
pretty
great
certainty
a
of
the
back
at
night
we
had
greyhounds
a
part
of
the
day
but
the
ground
on
the
hills
is
so
that
i
do
not
like
the
country
for
coursing
the
legs
are
presently
cut
to
pieces
budd
has
swedish
turnips
and
cabbages
of
various
kinds
transplanted
all
are
very
fine
indeed
it
is
impossible
to
make
more
satisfactory
experiments
in
than
have
been
made
here
but
this
is
not
a
proper
place
to
give
a
particular
account
of
them
i
went
to
see
the
best
cultivated
parts
round
newbury
but
i
saw
no
spot
with
half
the
feed
that
i
see
here
upon
a
spot
of
similar
extent
tarrant
hants
this
place
is
commonly
called
which
is
i
think
as
decent
a
corruption
of
names
as
one
would
wish
to
meet
with
however
uphusband
the
people
will
have
it
and
uphusband
it
shall
be
for
me
i
came
from
berghclere
this
morning
and
through
the
park
of
lord
caernarvon
at
highclere
it
is
a
fine
season
to
look
at
woods
the
oaks
are
still
covered
the
beeches
in
their
best
dress
the
elms
yet
pretty
green
and
the
beautiful
ashes
only
beginning
to
turn
off
this
is
according
to
my
fancy
the
prettiest
park
that
i
have
ever
seen
a
great
variety
of
hill
and
dell
a
good
deal
of
water
and
this
in
one
part
only
wants
the
of
american
trees
to
make
it
look
like
a
creek
for
the
water
runs
along
at
the
foot
of
a
steepish
hill
thickly
covered
with
trees
and
the
branches
of
the
lowermost
trees
hang
down
into
the
water
and
hide
the
bank
completely
i
like
this
place
better
than
or
any
other
gentleman
grounds
that
i
have
seen
the
i
did
not
care
about
though
it
appears
to
be
large
enough
to
hold
half
a
village
the
trees
are
very
good
and
the
woods
would
be
handsomer
if
the
larches
and
firs
were
for
which
only
they
are
fit
the
great
beauty
of
the
place
is
the
as
steep
in
some
places
as
the
roof
of
a
house
which
form
a
sort
of
boundary
in
the
form
of
a
part
of
a
crescent
to
about
a
third
part
of
the
park
and
then
slope
off
and
get
more
distant
for
about
half
another
third
part
a
part
of
these
downs
is
covered
with
trees
chiefly
beech
the
colour
of
which
at
this
season
forms
a
most
beautiful
contrast
with
that
of
the
down
itself
which
is
so
green
and
so
smooth
from
the
vale
in
the
park
along
which
we
rode
we
looked
apparently
almost
perpendicularly
up
at
the
downs
where
the
trees
have
extended
themselves
by
seed
more
in
some
places
than
others
and
thereby
formed
numerous
salient
parts
of
various
forms
and
of
course
as
many
and
as
variously
formed
glades
these
which
are
always
so
beautiful
in
forests
and
parks
are
peculiarly
beautiful
in
this
lofty
situation
and
with
verdure
so
smooth
as
that
of
these
chalky
downs
our
horses
beat
up
a
score
or
two
of
hares
as
we
crossed
the
park
and
though
we
met
with
no
made
of
scotch
fir
we
saw
something
a
great
deal
better
namely
about
forty
cows
the
most
beautiful
that
i
ever
saw
as
to
colour
at
least
they
appear
to
be
of
the
they
are
called
in
this
country
caernarvon
they
have
no
horns
and
their
colour
is
a
ground
of
white
with
black
or
red
spots
these
spots
being
from
the
size
of
a
plate
to
that
of
a
crown
piece
and
some
of
them
have
no
small
spots
these
cattle
were
lying
down
together
in
the
space
of
about
an
acre
of
ground
they
were
in
excellent
condition
and
so
fine
a
sight
of
the
kind
i
never
saw
upon
leaving
the
park
and
coming
over
the
hills
to
this
pretty
vale
of
uphusband
i
could
not
help
calculating
how
long
it
might
be
before
some
jew
would
begin
to
fix
his
eye
upon
highclere
and
talk
of
putting
out
the
present
owner
who
though
a
is
one
of
the
best
of
that
set
of
politicians
and
who
acted
a
manly
part
in
the
case
of
our
deeply
injured
and
deeply
lamented
queen
perhaps
his
lordship
thinks
that
there
is
no
fear
of
the
jews
as
to
but
does
he
think
that
his
tenants
can
sell
fat
hogs
at
a
score
and
pay
him
more
than
a
third
of
the
rent
that
they
have
paid
him
while
the
debt
was
contracting
i
know
that
such
a
man
does
not
lose
his
estate
at
once
but
without
rents
what
is
the
estate
and
that
the
jews
will
receive
the
far
greater
part
of
his
rents
is
certain
unless
the
interest
of
the
debt
be
reduced
lord
caernarvon
told
a
man
in
that
did
not
like
my
but
what
did
he
mean
by
my
i
have
no
politics
but
such
as
he
to
like
i
want
to
do
away
with
that
infernal
which
after
having
beggared
and
pauperized
the
labouring
classes
has
now
according
to
the
report
made
by
the
ministers
themselves
to
the
house
of
commons
plunged
the
owners
of
the
land
themselves
into
a
state
of
distress
for
which
those
ministers
themselves
can
hold
out
no
remedy
to
be
sure
i
labour
most
assiduously
to
destroy
a
system
of
distress
and
misery
but
is
that
any
reason
why
a
should
dislike
my
politics
however
dislike
or
like
them
to
them
to
those
very
politics
the
lords
themselves
come
at
and
that
i
should
exult
in
this
thought
and
take
little
pains
to
disguise
my
exultation
can
surprise
nobody
who
reflects
on
what
has
passed
within
these
last
twelve
years
if
the
landlords
be
well
if
things
be
going
right
with
them
if
they
have
fair
prospects
of
happy
days
then
what
need
they
care
about
me
and
but
if
they
find
themselves
in
and
do
not
know
how
to
get
out
of
it
and
if
they
have
been
plunged
into
this
distress
by
those
who
dislike
my
politics
is
there
not
for
men
of
sense
to
hesitate
a
little
before
they
those
politics
if
no
great
change
be
wanted
if
things
could
remain
even
then
men
may
with
some
show
of
reason
say
that
i
am
disturbing
that
which
ought
to
be
let
alone
but
if
things
can
not
remain
as
they
are
if
there
must
be
a
is
it
not
folly
and
indeed
is
it
not
a
species
of
idiotic
perverseness
for
men
to
set
their
faces
without
rhyme
or
reason
against
what
is
said
as
to
this
change
by
who
have
for
nearly
twenty
years
been
warning
the
country
of
its
danger
and
foretelling
that
which
has
now
come
to
pass
and
is
coming
to
pass
however
i
make
no
complaint
on
this
score
people
disliking
my
politics
neither
picks
my
pocket
nor
breaks
my
leg
as
jefferson
said
by
the
writings
of
the
atheists
if
they
be
pleased
in
disliking
my
politics
i
am
pleased
in
liking
them
and
so
we
are
both
enjoying
ourselves
if
the
country
wants
no
assistance
from
me
i
am
quite
sure
that
i
want
none
from
it
fat
hogs
have
lately
sold
in
this
village
at
a
score
but
would
hardly
bring
that
now
that
is
to
say
at
a
pound
the
hog
is
weighed
whole
when
killed
and
dressed
the
head
and
feet
are
included
but
so
is
the
lard
hogs
fatted
on
peas
or
may
be
called
the
very
best
meat
that
england
contains
at
salisbury
only
about
miles
off
fat
hogs
sell
for
to
a
score
but
then
observe
these
are
which
are
not
nearly
so
good
in
quality
as
the
hogs
but
i
shall
probably
hear
more
about
these
prices
as
i
get
further
towards
the
west
some
wheat
has
been
sold
at
for
a
load
bushels
that
is
at
a
bushel
a
considerable
part
of
the
crop
is
wholly
unfit
for
bread
flour
and
is
not
equal
in
value
to
good
barley
in
not
a
few
instances
the
wheat
has
been
carried
into
the
gate
or
yard
and
thrown
down
to
be
made
dung
of
so
that
if
we
were
to
take
the
average
it
would
not
exceed
i
am
convinced
a
bushel
in
this
part
of
the
country
and
the
average
of
all
england
would
not
perhaps
exceed
or
a
bushel
however
lord
liverpool
has
got
a
at
last
that
has
been
applied
somebody
sent
me
some
time
ago
that
stupid
newspaper
called
the
in
which
its
readers
were
reminded
of
my
i
having
as
this
paper
said
foretold
that
wheat
would
be
at
shillings
a
bushel
before
these
gentlemen
of
the
part
of
the
press
do
not
mind
lying
a
little
upon
a
pinch
see
walter
times
of
tuesday
last
for
the
following
cobbett
has
thrown
open
the
front
of
his
house
at
kensington
where
he
proposes
to
sell
meat
at
a
reduced
what
i
said
was
this
that
if
the
crop
were
good
and
the
harvest
fine
and
gold
continued
to
be
paid
at
the
bank
we
should
see
wheat
at
four
not
two
shillings
a
bushel
before
christmas
now
the
crop
was
in
many
parts
very
much
blighted
and
the
harvest
was
very
bad
indeed
and
yet
the
average
of
england
including
that
which
is
destroyed
or
not
brought
to
market
at
all
will
not
exceed
a
bushel
a
farmer
told
me
the
other
day
that
he
got
offered
for
some
of
his
wheat
that
he
was
resolved
not
to
take
any
more
of
it
to
market
but
to
give
it
to
hogs
therefore
in
speaking
of
the
price
of
wheat
you
are
to
take
in
the
unsold
as
well
as
the
sold
that
which
fetches
nothing
as
well
as
that
which
is
sold
at
high
i
see
in
the
irish
papers
which
have
overtaken
me
on
my
way
that
the
system
is
working
the
agriculturasses
in
the
too
the
following
paragraph
will
show
that
the
of
a
has
not
done
our
dear
sister
much
good
a
very
numerous
meeting
of
the
kildare
farming
society
met
at
naas
on
the
the
duke
of
leinster
in
the
chair
robert
de
la
touche
nothing
can
more
strongly
prove
the
badness
of
the
times
and
very
state
of
the
than
the
necessity
in
which
the
society
finds
itself
of
its
premiums
from
its
present
want
of
the
best
members
of
the
farming
classes
have
got
so
much
in
arrear
in
their
subscriptions
that
they
have
declined
to
appear
or
to
dine
with
their
neighbours
and
general
depression
damps
the
spirit
of
the
most
industrious
and
cultivators
you
are
mistaken
pat
it
is
not
the
any
more
than
it
is
the
bobadil
you
know
imputed
his
beating
to
the
by
the
foot
of
pharaoh
no
captain
says
welldon
indeed
it
was
a
it
is
not
the
dear
patrick
it
is
who
having
first
contracted
a
great
debt
in
depreciated
money
are
now
compelling
you
to
pay
the
interest
at
the
rate
of
three
for
one
whether
this
be
or
the
agriculturasses
best
know
it
is
much
more
their
affair
than
it
is
mine
but
be
you
well
assured
that
they
are
only
at
the
beginning
of
their
sorrows
ah
patrick
whoever
shall
live
only
a
few
years
will
see
a
in
your
state
something
a
more
than
catholic
emancipation
will
take
place
or
i
am
the
most
deceived
of
all
mankind
this
is
your
best
and
indeed
your
it
must
at
last
give
the
thing
a
such
as
it
never
had
the
accounts
which
my
country
newspapers
give
of
the
failure
of
farmers
are
perfectly
dismal
in
many
many
instances
they
have
put
an
end
to
their
existence
as
the
poor
deluded
creatures
did
who
had
been
ruined
by
the
south
sea
bubble
i
can
not
help
feeling
for
these
people
for
whom
my
birth
education
taste
and
habits
give
me
so
strong
a
partiality
who
can
help
feeling
for
their
wives
and
children
hurled
down
headlong
from
affluence
to
misery
in
the
space
of
a
few
months
become
all
of
a
sudden
the
mockery
of
those
whom
they
compelled
perhaps
to
cringe
before
them
if
the
labourers
exult
one
can
not
say
that
it
is
unnatural
if
have
her
fair
sway
i
am
exempted
from
all
pain
upon
this
occasion
i
have
done
my
best
to
prevent
these
calamities
those
farmers
who
have
attended
to
me
are
safe
while
the
storm
rages
my
endeavours
to
stop
the
evil
in
time
cost
me
the
earnings
of
twenty
long
years
i
did
not
sink
no
nor
beneath
the
heavy
and
reiterated
blows
of
the
accursed
system
which
i
have
dealt
back
blow
for
blow
and
blessed
be
god
i
now
see
it
it
is
staggering
about
like
a
sheep
with
water
in
the
head
turning
its
pate
up
on
one
side
seeming
to
listen
but
has
no
hearing
seeming
to
look
but
has
no
sight
one
day
it
capers
and
dances
the
next
it
mopes
and
seems
ready
to
die
this
to
my
fancy
is
a
very
nice
country
it
is
continual
hill
and
dell
now
and
then
a
of
hills
higher
than
the
rest
and
these
are
downs
or
woods
to
stand
upon
any
of
the
hills
and
look
around
you
you
almost
think
you
see
the
ups
and
downs
of
sea
in
a
as
the
sailors
call
it
after
what
they
call
a
gale
of
wind
the
undulations
are
endless
and
the
great
variety
in
the
height
breadth
length
and
form
of
the
little
hills
has
a
very
delightful
the
soil
which
to
look
it
appears
to
be
more
than
half
flint
stones
is
very
good
in
quality
and
in
general
better
on
the
tops
of
the
lesser
hills
than
in
the
valleys
it
has
great
tenacity
does
not
like
sand
or
light
loam
it
is
a
stiff
tenacious
loam
mixed
with
flint
stones
bears
well
and
all
sorts
of
grass
which
make
the
fields
on
the
hills
as
green
as
meadows
even
at
this
season
and
the
grass
does
not
burn
up
in
in
a
country
so
full
of
hills
one
would
expect
endless
runs
of
water
and
springs
there
are
none
absolutely
none
no
is
ever
made
in
the
land
no
ditches
round
the
fields
and
even
in
the
such
as
that
in
which
this
village
is
situated
though
it
winds
round
for
ten
or
fifteen
miles
there
is
no
run
of
water
even
now
there
is
the
of
a
brook
which
will
run
before
spring
and
it
continues
running
with
more
or
less
water
for
about
half
the
year
though
some
years
it
never
runs
at
all
it
rained
all
friday
night
pretty
nearly
all
day
yesterday
and
the
ground
is
as
dry
as
a
bone
except
just
along
the
street
of
the
village
which
has
been
kept
in
a
sort
of
stabble
by
the
flocks
of
sheep
passing
along
to
and
from
appleshaw
fair
in
the
deep
and
long
and
narrow
valleys
such
as
this
there
are
meadows
with
very
fine
herbage
and
very
productive
the
grass
very
fine
and
excellent
in
its
quality
it
is
very
curious
that
the
soil
is
much
in
the
vales
than
on
the
hills
in
the
vales
it
is
a
sort
of
on
a
bed
of
something
approaching
to
gravel
but
on
the
hills
it
is
stiff
loam
with
apparently
half
flints
on
a
bed
of
something
like
clay
first
reddish
not
yellow
and
then
comes
the
chalk
which
they
often
take
up
by
digging
a
sort
of
wells
and
then
they
spread
it
on
the
surface
as
they
do
the
clay
in
some
countries
where
they
sometimes
fetch
it
many
miles
and
at
an
immense
expense
it
was
very
common
near
botley
to
chalk
land
at
an
expense
of
sixteen
pounds
an
the
land
here
is
excellent
in
quality
generally
unless
you
get
upon
the
highest
chains
of
hills
they
have
frequently
bushels
of
wheat
to
the
acre
their
barley
is
very
fine
and
their
abundant
the
turnips
are
in
general
very
good
at
this
time
and
the
land
appears
as
capable
of
carrying
fine
crops
of
them
as
any
land
that
i
have
seen
a
fine
country
for
sheep
always
dry
they
never
injure
the
land
when
feeding
off
turnips
in
wet
weather
and
they
can
lie
down
on
the
dry
for
the
ground
is
in
fact
never
wet
except
while
the
rain
is
actually
falling
sometimes
in
and
the
rain
runs
down
the
hills
in
torrents
but
is
gone
directly
the
flocks
of
sheep
some
in
fold
and
some
at
large
feeding
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
give
great
additional
beauty
to
the
the
woods
which
consist
chiefly
of
oak
thinly
intermixed
with
ash
and
well
set
with
underwood
of
ash
and
hazle
but
mostly
the
latter
are
very
beautiful
they
sometimes
stretch
along
the
top
and
sides
of
hills
for
miles
together
and
as
their
edges
or
outsides
joining
the
fields
and
the
downs
go
winding
and
twisting
about
and
as
the
fields
and
downs
are
naked
of
trees
the
sight
altogether
is
very
the
trees
in
the
deep
and
long
valleys
especially
the
elm
and
the
ash
are
very
fine
and
very
lofty
and
from
distance
to
distance
the
rooks
have
made
them
their
habitation
this
sort
of
country
which
in
irregular
shape
is
of
great
extent
has
many
and
great
advantages
dry
under
foot
good
roads
winter
as
well
as
summer
and
little
very
little
expense
flourishes
fences
cost
little
wood
hurdles
and
cheap
no
shade
in
wet
harvests
the
water
in
the
wells
excellent
good
sporting
country
except
for
coursing
and
too
many
flints
for
what
becomes
of
all
the
there
is
a
spring
in
one
of
the
cross
valleys
that
runs
into
this
having
a
basin
about
thirty
feet
over
and
about
eight
feet
deep
which
they
say
sends
up
water
once
in
about
or
years
and
boils
up
so
as
to
make
a
large
current
of
not
far
from
uphusband
the
i
think
it
is
called
crosses
the
country
sir
richard
colt
hoare
has
written
a
great
deal
about
this
ancient
boundary
which
is
indeed
something
very
curious
in
the
ploughed
fields
the
traces
of
it
are
quite
gone
but
they
remain
in
the
as
well
as
on
the
downs
a
this
morning
the
hills
round
about
beautiful
at
the
rooks
making
that
noise
which
they
always
make
in
winter
mornings
the
starlings
are
come
in
large
flocks
and
which
is
deemed
a
sign
of
a
hard
winter
the
fieldfares
are
come
at
an
early
season
the
haws
are
very
abundant
which
they
say
is
another
sign
of
a
hard
winter
the
wheat
is
high
enough
here
in
some
fields
to
hide
a
hare
which
is
indeed
not
saying
much
for
it
as
a
hare
knows
how
to
hide
herself
upon
the
bare
ground
but
it
is
in
some
fields
four
inches
high
and
is
green
and
gay
the
colour
being
finer
than
that
of
any
the
fuel
here
is
wood
little
coal
is
brought
from
andover
a
load
of
fagots
does
not
cost
above
so
that
in
this
respect
the
labourers
are
pretty
well
off
the
wages
here
and
in
berkshire
about
a
week
but
the
farmers
talk
of
lowering
the
heavy
and
heavy
they
must
be
till
taxes
and
rents
come
down
saturday
and
appleshaw
the
sheep
which
had
taken
a
rise
at
weyhill
fair
have
fallen
again
even
below
the
norfolk
and
sussex
mark
some
southdown
lambs
were
sold
at
appleshaw
so
low
as
and
some
even
lower
some
dorsetshire
ewes
brought
no
more
than
a
pound
and
perhaps
the
average
did
not
exceed
i
have
seen
a
farmer
here
who
can
get
or
could
a
few
days
ago
round
for
a
lot
of
fat
southdown
wethers
which
cost
him
just
that
money
when
they
were
lambs
years
it
is
impossible
that
they
can
have
cost
him
less
than
each
during
the
two
years
having
to
be
fed
on
turnips
or
hay
in
winter
and
to
be
fatted
on
good
grass
here
upon
one
hundred
sheep
is
a
loss
of
and
in
addition
at
five
per
cent
interest
on
the
sum
expended
in
the
purchase
even
suppose
not
a
sheep
has
been
lost
by
death
or
i
mentioned
before
i
believe
that
fat
hogs
are
sold
at
salisbury
at
from
to
the
pounds
dead
cheese
has
come
down
in
the
same
proportion
a
correspondent
informs
me
that
one
hundred
and
fifty
welsh
sheep
were
on
the
of
october
offered
for
a
head
and
that
they
went
away
unsold
the
skin
was
worth
a
shilling
of
the
money
the
following
i
take
from
the
of
the
of
october
last
week
at
northawton
fair
thomas
cooper
of
bow
purchased
three
milch
cows
and
forty
sheep
for
the
skins
four
years
ago
would
have
sold
for
more
than
the
money
the
says
that
on
november
thursday
at
newbury
market
wheat
sold
from
to
the
quarter
this
would
make
an
average
of
but
very
little
indeed
was
sold
at
only
the
prime
of
the
old
wheat
the
best
of
the
new
for
about
and
then
if
we
take
into
view
the
great
proportion
that
can
not
go
to
market
at
all
we
shall
not
find
the
average
even
in
this
rather
dear
part
of
england
to
exceed
or
a
bushel
and
if
we
take
all
england
through
it
does
not
come
up
to
that
nor
anything
like
it
a
farmer
very
sensibly
observed
to
me
yesterday
that
if
we
had
had
such
a
crop
and
such
a
harvest
a
few
years
ago
good
wheat
would
have
been
a
load
that
is
to
say
a
bushel
nothing
can
be
truer
than
this
and
nothing
can
be
clearer
than
that
the
present
race
of
farmers
generally
speaking
must
be
swept
away
by
bankruptcy
if
they
do
not
in
time
make
their
bow
and
retire
there
are
two
descriptions
of
farmers
very
distinct
as
to
the
effects
which
this
change
must
naturally
have
on
them
the
word
comes
from
the
french
and
signifies
those
only
who
rent
therefore
are
properly
speaking
those
who
till
their
own
land
are
and
when
i
was
a
boy
it
was
the
common
practice
to
call
the
former
and
the
latter
these
yeomen
have
for
the
greater
part
been
swallowed
up
by
the
which
has
drawn
such
masses
of
money
together
they
have
by
degrees
been
still
there
are
some
few
left
and
these
if
not
in
debt
will
stand
their
ground
but
all
the
present
race
of
mere
renters
must
give
way
in
one
manner
or
another
they
must
break
or
drop
their
style
greatly
even
in
the
latter
case
their
rent
must
very
shortly
be
diminished
more
than
then
comes
the
and
the
sooner
the
in
the
i
find
the
following
prime
beef
was
sold
in
salisbury
market
on
tuesday
last
at
per
and
good
joints
of
mutton
at
butter
and
per
in
the
west
of
cornwall
during
the
summer
pork
has
often
been
sold
at
per
lb
this
is
very
true
and
what
can
be
better
how
can
peel
bill
work
in
a
more
delightful
manner
what
nice
working
of
the
country
have
now
very
little
to
do
they
have
what
they
have
out
they
it
is
so
much
and
of
course
they
become
poorer
and
poorer
because
they
must
like
a
mortgager
have
more
and
more
to
pay
as
prices
fall
this
is
very
good
for
it
will
make
them
disgorge
a
part
at
least
of
what
they
have
swallowed
during
the
years
of
high
prices
and
depreciation
they
are
worked
in
this
sort
of
way
the
the
for
instance
hold
their
sittings
every
six
weeks
in
certain
towns
about
the
country
they
will
receive
the
country
rags
if
the
rag
man
can
find
and
will
give
security
for
the
due
payment
of
his
rags
when
they
arrive
in
london
for
want
of
such
security
or
of
some
formality
of
the
kind
there
was
a
great
bustle
in
a
town
in
this
county
not
many
days
ago
the
demanded
sovereigns
or
bank
of
england
notes
precisely
how
the
matter
was
finally
settled
i
know
not
but
the
reader
will
see
that
the
exciseman
was
only
taking
a
proper
precaution
for
if
the
rags
were
not
paid
in
london
the
loss
was
his
tuesday
noon
i
left
uphusband
this
morning
at
and
came
across
to
this
place
miles
in
a
came
up
the
valley
of
uphusband
which
ends
at
about
miles
from
the
village
and
puts
one
out
upon
the
wiltshire
downs
which
stretch
away
towards
the
west
and
towards
devizes
and
towards
salisbury
after
about
half
a
mile
of
down
we
came
down
into
a
level
country
the
flints
cease
and
the
chalk
comes
nearer
the
top
of
the
ground
the
labourers
along
here
seem
very
poor
indeed
farmhouses
with
twenty
ricks
round
each
besides
those
standing
in
the
fields
pieces
of
wheat
or
acres
in
a
piece
but
a
group
of
women
labourers
who
were
attending
the
measurers
to
measure
their
reaping
work
presented
such
an
assemblage
of
rags
as
i
never
before
saw
even
amongst
the
hoppers
at
farnham
many
of
whom
are
common
beggars
i
never
before
saw
people
and
reapers
too
observe
so
miserable
in
appearance
as
these
there
were
some
very
pretty
girls
but
ragged
as
colts
and
as
pale
as
ashes
the
day
was
cold
too
and
frost
hardly
off
the
ground
and
their
blue
arms
and
lips
would
have
made
any
heart
ache
but
that
of
a
or
a
a
little
after
passing
by
these
poor
things
whom
i
left
cursing
as
i
went
those
who
had
brought
them
to
this
state
i
came
to
a
group
of
shabby
houses
upon
a
hill
while
the
boy
was
watering
his
horses
i
asked
the
ostler
the
of
the
place
and
as
the
old
women
say
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
when
he
said
the
whole
of
the
houses
are
not
intrinsically
worth
a
thousand
pounds
there
stood
a
thing
out
in
the
middle
of
the
place
about
feet
long
and
wide
being
a
room
stuck
up
on
unhewed
stone
pillars
about
feet
high
it
was
the
town
hall
where
the
ceremony
of
choosing
the
is
performed
this
place
sends
members
to
parliament
do
it
said
i
to
the
ostler
yes
sir
who
are
members
i
indeed
sir
i
have
not
read
the
of
voltaire
for
these
years
but
in
ruminating
upon
the
ostler
answer
and
in
thinking
how
the
world
yes
whole
has
been
deceived
as
to
this
matter
two
lines
of
that
poem
came
across
my
memory
représentans
du
peuple
les
grands
et
le
roi
spectacle
magnifique
source
sacrée
des
lois
the
frenchman
for
want
of
understanding
the
thing
as
well
as
i
do
left
the
eulogium
incomplete
i
therefore
here
add
four
lines
which
i
request
those
who
publish
future
editions
of
the
henriade
to
insert
in
continuation
of
the
above
eulogium
of
voltaire
représentans
du
peuple
que
ignore
sont
fait
à
miracle
pour
garder
son
or
peuple
trop
heureux
que
le
bonheur
inonde
de
vos
voisins
admiré
du
monde
the
first
line
was
suggested
by
the
ostler
the
last
by
the
words
which
we
so
very
often
hear
from
the
bar
the
bench
the
the
pulpit
and
the
throne
doubtless
my
poetry
is
not
equal
to
that
of
voltaire
but
my
rhyme
is
as
good
as
his
and
my
is
a
great
deal
in
quitting
this
villanous
place
we
see
the
extensive
and
uncommonly
ugly
park
and
domain
of
lord
aylesbury
who
seems
to
have
tacked
park
on
to
park
like
so
many
outworks
of
a
fortified
city
i
suppose
here
are
or
farms
of
former
days
swallowed
up
they
have
been
bought
i
dare
say
from
time
to
time
and
it
would
be
a
labour
very
well
worthy
of
reward
by
the
public
to
trace
to
its
source
the
money
by
which
these
immense
domains
in
different
parts
of
the
country
have
been
formed
marlborough
which
is
an
place
enough
is
succeeded
on
my
road
to
swindon
by
an
extensive
and
very
beautiful
down
about
miles
over
here
nature
has
flung
the
earth
about
in
a
great
variety
of
shapes
the
fine
short
smooth
grass
has
about
inches
of
mould
under
it
and
then
comes
the
chalk
the
water
that
runs
down
the
narrow
valleys
is
caught
in
different
parts
of
the
down
in
basins
made
on
purpose
and
lined
with
clay
apparently
this
is
for
watering
the
sheep
in
summer
sure
sign
of
a
really
dry
soil
and
yet
the
grass
never
upon
these
downs
the
chalk
holds
the
moisture
and
the
grass
is
fed
by
the
dews
in
hot
and
dry
at
the
end
of
this
down
the
ends
the
hill
is
high
and
steep
and
from
it
you
look
immediately
down
into
a
level
farming
country
a
little
further
on
into
the
whence
the
cheese
comes
and
beyond
that
into
the
vale
of
berkshire
and
even
to
oxford
which
lies
away
to
the
from
this
the
land
continues
good
flat
and
rather
wet
to
swindon
which
is
a
plain
country
town
built
of
the
stone
which
is
found
at
about
feet
under
ground
about
i
come
on
now
towards
cirencester
thro
the
dairy
county
of
north
wilts
wednesday
noon
i
slept
at
a
house
at
hannington
about
eight
miles
from
swindon
and
five
on
one
side
of
my
road
i
passed
through
that
villanous
hole
cricklade
about
two
hours
ago
and
certainly
a
more
rascally
looking
place
i
never
set
my
eyes
on
i
wished
to
avoid
it
but
could
get
along
no
other
way
all
along
here
the
land
is
a
whitish
stiff
loam
upon
a
bed
of
soft
stone
which
is
found
at
various
distances
from
the
surface
sometimes
two
feet
and
sometimes
ten
here
and
there
a
field
is
fenced
with
this
stone
laid
together
in
walls
without
mortar
or
earth
all
the
houses
and
are
made
of
it
and
even
covered
with
the
thinnest
of
it
formed
into
tiles
the
stiles
in
the
fields
are
made
of
large
flags
of
this
stone
and
the
gaps
in
the
hedges
are
stopped
with
there
is
very
little
wood
all
along
here
the
labourers
seem
miserably
poor
their
dwellings
are
little
better
than
and
their
looks
indicate
that
their
food
is
not
nearly
equal
to
that
of
a
pig
their
wretched
hovels
are
stuck
upon
little
bits
of
ground
the
road
where
the
space
has
been
wider
than
the
road
demanded
in
many
places
they
have
not
two
rods
to
a
hovel
it
seems
as
if
they
had
been
swept
off
the
fields
by
a
hurricane
and
had
dropped
and
found
shelter
under
the
banks
on
the
road
side
yesterday
morning
was
a
sharp
frost
and
this
had
set
the
poor
creatures
to
digging
up
their
little
plats
of
potatoes
in
my
whole
life
i
never
saw
human
wretchedness
equal
to
this
no
not
even
amongst
the
free
negroes
in
america
who
on
an
average
do
not
work
one
day
out
of
four
and
this
is
is
it
these
oh
pitt
are
the
fruits
of
thy
hellish
system
however
this
is
a
horrible
county
this
is
the
county
that
the
man
belongs
to
the
land
all
along
here
is
good
fine
fields
and
pastures
all
around
and
yet
the
cultivators
of
those
fields
so
miserable
this
is
particularly
the
case
on
both
sides
of
cricklade
and
in
it
too
where
everything
had
the
air
of
the
most
deplorable
they
are
sowing
wheat
all
the
way
from
the
wiltshire
downs
to
cirencester
though
there
is
some
wheat
up
are
up
in
some
places
and
look
very
the
turnips
of
both
kinds
are
good
all
along
i
met
a
farmer
going
with
porkers
to
highworth
market
they
would
weigh
he
said
four
score
and
a
half
and
he
expected
to
get
a
score
i
expect
he
will
not
he
said
they
had
been
fed
on
but
i
did
not
believe
him
i
put
it
to
his
honour
whether
whey
and
beans
had
not
been
their
food
he
looked
surly
and
pushed
on
this
stiff
ground
they
grow
a
good
many
beans
and
give
them
to
the
pigs
with
whey
which
makes
excellent
pork
for
the
but
which
must
meet
with
a
pretty
hungry
stomach
to
swallow
it
in
hampshire
the
hogs
all
the
way
that
i
have
come
from
buckinghamshire
are
without
a
single
exception
that
i
have
seen
the
hogs
blount
at
uphusband
has
one
which
now
weighs
about
thirty
score
and
will
possibly
weigh
forty
for
she
moves
about
very
easily
yet
this
is
the
weight
of
a
good
ox
and
yet
what
a
little
thing
it
is
compared
to
an
ox
between
cricklade
and
this
place
cirencester
i
met
in
separate
droves
about
two
thousand
welsh
cattle
on
their
way
from
pembrokeshire
to
the
fairs
in
sussex
the
greater
part
of
them
were
heifers
in
calf
they
were
purchased
in
wales
at
from
to
each
none
of
them
the
drovers
told
me
reached
these
heifers
used
to
fetch
at
home
from
to
and
sometimes
more
many
of
the
things
that
i
saw
in
these
droves
did
not
fetch
in
wales
and
they
go
to
no
market
now
is
there
a
man
in
his
senses
who
believes
that
this
thing
can
go
on
in
the
present
way
however
a
fine
thing
indeed
is
this
fall
of
prices
my
cottager
will
easily
get
his
cow
and
a
young
cow
too
for
less
than
the
that
i
talked
of
these
welsh
heifers
will
calve
about
may
and
they
are
just
the
very
thing
for
a
cottager
thursday
morning
in
leaving
cirencester
which
is
a
pretty
large
town
a
pretty
nice
town
and
which
the
people
call
i
came
up
hill
into
a
country
apparently
formerly
a
down
or
common
but
now
divided
into
large
fields
by
stone
walls
anything
so
ugly
i
have
never
seen
before
the
stone
which
on
the
other
side
of
cirencester
lay
a
good
way
under
ground
here
lies
very
near
to
the
surface
the
plough
is
continually
bringing
it
up
and
thus
in
general
come
the
means
of
making
the
walls
that
serve
as
fences
anything
quite
so
cheerless
as
this
i
do
not
recollect
to
have
seen
for
the
bagshot
country
and
the
commons
between
farnham
and
haslemere
have
at
any
rate
but
these
stones
are
quite
abominable
the
turnips
are
not
a
of
a
crop
like
those
of
clarke
at
in
norfolk
or
pym
at
reigate
in
surrey
or
of
brazier
at
worth
in
sussex
i
see
thirty
acres
here
that
have
less
upon
them
than
i
saw
the
other
day
upon
half
an
acre
at
budd
at
berghclere
it
be
good
farming
to
plough
and
sow
and
hoe
thirty
acres
to
get
what
be
got
upon
half
an
acre
can
that
half
acre
cost
more
than
a
tenth
part
as
much
as
the
thirty
acres
but
if
i
were
to
go
to
this
farmer
and
tell
him
what
to
do
to
the
half
acre
would
he
not
exclaim
with
the
farmer
at
botley
what
away
all
that
ground
between
the
blood
with
the
exception
of
a
little
dell
about
eight
miles
from
cititer
this
miserable
country
continued
to
the
distance
of
ten
miles
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
looked
down
from
the
top
of
a
high
hill
into
vale
of
never
was
there
surely
such
a
contrast
in
this
world
this
hill
is
called
it
is
much
about
a
mile
down
it
and
the
descent
so
steep
as
to
require
the
wheel
of
the
chaise
to
be
locked
and
even
with
that
precaution
i
did
not
think
it
over
and
above
safe
to
sit
in
the
chaise
so
upon
sir
robert
wilson
principle
of
taking
care
of
i
got
out
and
walked
down
from
this
hill
you
see
the
morvan
hills
in
wales
you
look
down
into
a
sort
of
with
a
flat
bottom
the
hills
are
the
sides
of
the
dish
and
the
city
of
gloucester
which
you
plainly
see
at
seven
miles
distance
from
burlip
hill
appears
to
be
not
far
from
the
centre
of
the
dish
all
here
is
fine
fine
farms
fine
pastures
all
enclosed
fields
all
divided
by
hedges
orchards
a
plenty
and
i
had
scarcely
seen
one
apple
since
i
left
gloucester
is
a
fine
clean
beautiful
place
and
which
is
of
a
vast
deal
more
importance
the
labourers
dwellings
as
i
came
along
looked
good
and
the
labourers
themselves
pretty
well
as
to
dress
and
healthiness
the
girls
at
work
in
the
fields
always
my
standard
are
not
in
rags
with
bits
of
shoes
tied
on
their
feet
and
rags
tied
round
their
ankles
as
they
had
in

friday
i
got
to
this
beautiful
place
william
palmer
yesterday
from
gloucester
this
is
in
the
parish
of
two
miles
on
the
gloucester
side
of
ross
and
if
not
the
first
nearly
the
first
parish
in
herefordshire
upon
leaving
gloucester
to
go
on
through
ross
to
on
quitting
gloucester
i
crossed
the
severne
which
had
overflowed
its
banks
and
covered
the
meadows
with
the
soil
good
but
stiff
the
coppices
and
woods
very
much
like
those
upon
the
clays
in
the
south
of
hampshire
and
in
sussex
but
the
land
better
for
corn
and
grass
the
goodness
of
the
land
is
shown
by
the
and
by
the
sort
of
sheep
and
cattle
fed
here
the
sheep
are
a
cross
between
the
ryland
and
leicester
and
the
cattle
of
the
herefordshire
kind
these
would
starve
in
the
pastures
of
any
part
of
hampshire
or
sussex
that
i
have
ever
at
about
seven
miles
from
gloucester
i
came
to
hills
and
the
land
changed
from
the
whitish
soil
which
i
had
hitherto
seen
to
a
red
brown
with
layers
of
flat
stone
of
a
reddish
cast
under
it
thus
it
continued
to
bollitree
the
trees
of
all
kinds
are
very
fine
on
the
hills
as
well
as
in
the
the
spot
where
i
now
am
is
peculiarly
well
situated
in
all
respects
the
land
very
rich
the
pastures
the
finest
i
ever
saw
the
trees
of
all
kinds
surpassing
upon
an
average
any
that
i
have
before
seen
in
england
from
the
house
you
see
in
front
and
winding
round
to
the
left
a
lofty
hill
called
at
about
a
mile
and
a
half
distance
covered
with
oaks
of
the
finest
growth
along
at
the
foot
of
this
wood
are
fields
and
orchards
continuing
the
slope
of
the
hill
down
for
a
considerable
distance
and
as
the
ground
lies
in
a
sort
of
from
the
wood
to
the
foot
of
the
slope
the
is
very
beautiful
one
of
these
dells
with
the
two
adjoining
sides
of
hills
is
an
orchard
belonging
to
palmer
and
the
trees
the
ground
and
everything
belonging
to
it
put
me
in
mind
of
the
most
beautiful
of
the
spots
in
the
north
of
long
island
sheltered
by
a
lofty
wood
the
grass
fine
beneath
the
fruit
trees
the
soil
dry
under
foot
though
the
rain
had
scarcely
ceased
to
fall
no
moss
on
the
trees
the
leaves
of
many
of
them
yet
green
everything
brought
my
mind
to
the
beautiful
orchards
near
bayside
little
neck
mosquito
cove
and
oyster
bay
in
long
island
no
wonder
that
this
is
a
country
of
and
but
what
a
shame
it
is
that
here
at
any
rate
the
owners
and
cultivators
of
the
soil
not
content
with
these
should
for
mere
fashion
sake
waste
their
substance
on
and
they
really
deserve
the
contempt
of
mankind
and
the
curses
of
their
the
woody
hill
mentioned
before
winds
away
to
the
left
and
carries
the
eye
on
to
the
of
from
which
it
is
divided
by
a
narrow
and
very
deep
valley
away
to
the
right
of
penyard
hill
lies
in
the
bottom
at
two
miles
distance
and
on
the
bank
of
the
river
wye
the
town
of
ross
over
which
we
look
down
the
vale
to
monmouth
and
see
the
welsh
hills
beyond
it
beneath
penyard
hill
and
on
one
of
the
before
mentioned
is
the
parish
church
of
weston
with
some
pretty
white
cottages
near
it
peeping
through
the
orchard
and
other
trees
and
coming
to
the
paddock
before
the
house
are
some
of
the
largest
and
loftiest
trees
in
the
country
standing
singly
here
and
there
amongst
which
is
the
very
largest
and
loftiest
that
i
believe
i
ever
saw
either
in
america
or
in
england
in
short
there
wants
nothing
but
the
autumnal
of
the
american
trees
to
make
this
the
most
beautiful
spot
i
ever
i
was
much
amused
for
an
hour
after
daylight
this
morning
in
looking
at
the
rising
at
intervals
from
the
dells
on
the
side
of
penyard
hill
and
flying
to
the
top
and
then
over
the
hill
some
of
the
clouds
went
up
in
a
roundish
and
compact
form
others
rose
in
a
sort
of
string
or
stream
the
tops
of
them
going
over
the
hill
before
the
bottoms
were
clear
of
the
place
whence
they
had
arisen
sometimes
the
clouds
gathered
themselves
together
along
the
top
of
the
hill
and
seemed
to
connect
the
topmost
trees
with
the
i
have
been
to
look
at
palmer
fine
crops
of
which
are
in
general
called
these
crops
having
been
raised
according
to
i
feel
of
course
great
interest
in
the
matter
the
swedes
occupy
two
fields
one
of
thirteen
and
one
of
seventeen
acres
the
main
part
of
the
field
was
on
ridges
four
feet
apart
a
single
row
on
a
ridge
at
different
times
between
april
and
may
an
acre
and
a
half
of
this
piece
was
on
ridges
july
about
half
an
acre
across
the
middle
of
the
field
was
sown
in
the
field
there
is
about
half
an
acre
sown
on
the
of
june
the
rest
of
the
field
was
part
in
the
first
week
of
june
part
in
the
last
week
of
june
part
from
the
to
july
and
the
rest
about
three
acres
from
to
july
the
drilled
swedes
in
the
field
contain
full
tons
to
the
acre
the
transplanted
ones
in
field
tons
and
the
not
exceeding
tons
those
in
the
field
which
were
transplanted
before
the
july
contain
if
not
tons
and
the
rest
of
field
about
tons
to
the
acre
the
piece
here
half
an
acre
may
contain
tons
the
shortness
of
my
time
will
prevent
us
from
ascertaining
the
weight
by
actual
weighings
but
such
is
the
crop
according
to
the
best
of
my
judgment
after
a
very
minute
survey
of
it
in
every
part
of
each
now
here
is
a
little
short
of
tons
of
food
about
a
fifth
part
of
which
consists
of
and
of
course
there
is
about
tons
of
as
to
the
and
of
this
prodigious
crop
i
need
say
nothing
and
as
to
the
time
and
manner
of
sowing
and
raising
the
plants
for
transplanting
the
act
of
transplanting
and
the
after
cultivation
palmer
has
followed
the
directions
contained
in
my
residence
in
and
indeed
he
is
forward
to
acknowledge
that
he
had
never
thought
of
this
mode
of
culture
which
he
has
followed
now
for
three
years
and
which
he
has
found
so
advantageous
until
he
read
that
work
a
work
which
the
thought
proper
to
treat
as
a
mr
palmer
has
had
some
of
the
large
kind
he
had
about
three
acres
in
rows
at
four
feet
apart
and
at
little
less
than
three
feet
apart
in
the
rows
making
cabbages
on
the
three
acres
he
kept
wethers
and
ewes
large
fatting
sheep
upon
them
for
all
but
two
days
ending
in
the
first
week
of
november
the
sheep
which
are
now
feeding
off
yellow
turnips
in
an
adjoining
part
of
the
same
field
come
back
over
the
and
out
the
almost
to
the
ground
in
many
cases
this
ground
is
going
to
be
ploughed
for
wheat
immediately
cabbages
are
a
very
fine
but
it
is
the
on
which
you
must
rely
for
the
spring
and
on
or
swedes
too
for
they
will
in
many
of
our
winters
if
left
in
the
ground
i
have
had
them
rot
myself
and
i
saw
in
march
hundreds
of
acres
rotten
in
warwickshire
and
northamptonshire
palmer
greatly
prefers
the
to
the
drilling
it
has
numerous
advantages
over
the
drilling
greater
regularity
of
crop
greater
certainty
the
only
way
of
avoiding
the
greater
crop
admitting
of
two
months
later
preparation
of
land
can
come
cut
up
for
horses
as
indeed
a
part
of
palmer
transplanted
swedes
did
and
requiring
less
labour
and
expense
i
asserted
this
in
my
and
palmer
who
has
been
very
particular
in
ascertaining
the
fact
states
positively
that
the
expense
of
transplanting
is
not
so
great
as
the
hoeing
and
setting
out
of
the
drilled
crops
and
not
so
great
as
the
common
hoeings
of
this
i
think
settles
the
question
but
the
advantages
of
the
culture
by
no
means
confine
themselves
to
the
green
and
root
crop
for
palmer
drills
his
wheat
upon
the
same
ridges
without
ploughing
after
he
has
taken
off
the
swedes
he
drills
it
at
and
puts
in
from
eight
to
ten
gallons
to
the
acre
his
crop
of
drilled
in
this
way
averaged
bushels
to
the
acre
part
drilled
in
november
and
part
so
late
as
february
it
was
the
common
lammas
wheat
his
last
crop
of
wheat
is
not
yet
ascertained
but
it
was
better
after
the
swedes
than
in
any
other
of
his
land
his
manner
of
taking
off
the
crop
is
excellent
he
first
cuts
off
and
carries
away
the
then
he
has
an
implement
drawn
by
two
oxen
walking
on
each
side
of
the
ridge
with
which
he
cuts
off
the
of
the
swedes
without
disturbing
the
land
of
the
ridge
any
child
can
then
pull
up
the
bulb
thus
the
ground
clean
as
a
garden
and
in
that
compact
state
which
the
wheat
is
well
known
to
like
is
ready
at
once
for
drilling
with
wheat
as
to
the
to
which
he
applies
the
crop
tops
as
well
as
bulbs
i
must
speak
of
these
hereafter
and
in
a
work
of
a
description
different
from
this
i
have
been
thus
particular
here
because
the
treated
my
book
as
a
pack
of
lies
i
know
that
my
for
it
is
system
of
husbandry
will
finally
be
that
of
as
it
already
is
that
of
america
but
what
i
am
doing
here
is
merely
in
against
the
slanders
the
malignant
slanders
of
the
where
is
a
who
some
years
ago
wrote
to
a
gentleman
that
would
have
to
with
any
that
was
engaged
in
but
in
spite
of
the
brutal
farmers
are
not
such
fools
as
this
lord
was
they
will
not
reject
a
good
crop
because
they
can
have
it
only
by
acting
upon
my
plan
and
this
lord
will
i
imagine
yet
see
the
day
when
he
will
be
less
averse
from
having
to
do
with
a
reform
in
which
cobbett
shall
be
engaged
hall
saturday
night
went
to
hereford
this
morning
it
was
my
arrival
became
known
and
i
am
sure
i
can
not
tell
how
a
sort
of
got
about
i
could
perceive
here
as
i
always
have
elsewhere
very
ardent
friends
and
very
bitter
enemies
but
all
full
of
curiosity
one
thing
could
not
fail
to
please
me
exceedingly
my
friends
were
and
my
enemies
the
former
smiled
and
the
latter
in
endeavouring
to
screw
their
features
into
a
sneer
could
get
them
no
further
than
the
half
sour
and
half
sad
the
former
seemed
in
their
looks
to
say
here
he
is
and
the
latter
to
respond
yes
g
d
him
i
went
into
the
amongst
the
farmers
with
whom
in
general
i
was
very
much
pleased
if
i
were
to
live
in
the
county
two
months
i
should
be
acquainted
with
every
man
of
them
the
country
is
very
fine
all
the
way
from
ross
to
hereford
the
soil
is
always
a
red
loam
upon
a
bed
of
stone
the
trees
are
very
fine
and
certainly
winter
comes
later
here
than
in
middlesex
some
of
the
oak
trees
are
still
perfectly
green
and
many
of
the
ashes
as
green
as
in
in
coming
from
hereford
to
this
place
which
is
the
residence
of
palmer
and
that
of
her
two
younger
sons
philip
and
walter
palmer
who
with
their
brother
had
accompanied
me
to
hereford
in
coming
to
this
place
which
lies
at
about
two
miles
distance
from
the
great
road
and
at
about
an
equal
distance
from
hereford
and
from
ross
we
met
with
something
the
sight
of
which
pleased
me
exceedingly
it
was
that
of
a
very
pretty
lady
and
too
with
two
beautiful
children
riding
in
a
little
sort
of
drawn
by
which
she
was
driving
in
reins
she
appeared
to
be
well
known
to
my
friends
who
drew
up
and
spoke
to
her
calling
her
or
i
hope
it
was
not
or
some
such
name
her
husband
who
is
i
suppose
some
young
farmer
of
the
neighbourhood
may
well
call
himself
for
to
have
such
a
wife
and
for
such
a
wife
to
have
the
good
sense
to
put
up
with
an
in
order
to
avoid
as
much
as
possible
feeding
those
cormorants
who
gorge
on
the
taxes
is
a
blessing
that
falls
i
am
afraid
to
the
lot
of
very
few
rich
farmers
if
that
be
her
name
is
a
real
others
of
us
resort
to
radical
coffee
and
radical
tea
and
she
has
a
radical
carriage
this
is
a
very
effectual
way
of
assailing
the
thing
and
peculiarly
well
suited
for
the
practice
of
the
female
sex
but
the
ought
not
to
be
imposed
on
the
wife
only
the
husband
ought
to
set
the
example
and
let
me
hope
that
does
not
indulge
in
the
use
of
wine
and
spirits
while
mrs
lock
and
her
children
ride
in
a
jackass
gig
for
if
he
do
he
wastes
in
this
way
the
means
of
keeping
her
a
chariot
and
pair
if
there
be
to
be
any
expense
not
absolutely
necessary
if
there
be
to
be
anything
bordering
on
extravagance
surely
it
ought
to
be
for
the
pleasure
of
that
part
of
the
family
who
have
the
least
number
of
objects
of
enjoyment
and
for
a
husband
to
indulge
himself
in
the
guzzling
of
expensive
unnecessary
and
really
injurious
drink
to
the
tune
perhaps
of
or
pounds
a
year
while
he
preaches
economy
to
his
wife
and
with
a
face
as
long
as
my
arm
talks
of
the
low
price
of
corn
and
wheedles
her
out
of
a
curricle
into
a
cart
is
not
only
unjust
but
hall
sunday
night
we
have
ridden
though
in
the
rain
for
a
great
part
of
the
time
over
the
fine
farm
of
philip
palmer
at
this
place
and
that
of
walter
palmer
in
the
adjoining
parish
of
pencoyd
everything
here
is
good
arable
land
pastures
orchards
coppices
and
timber
trees
especially
the
elms
many
scores
of
which
approach
nearly
to
a
hundred
feet
in
height
philip
palmer
has
four
acres
of
swedes
on
ridges
drilled
on
the
and
of
may
the
plants
were
very
much
injured
by
the
so
much
that
it
was
a
question
whether
the
whole
piece
ought
not
to
be
ploughed
up
however
the
gaps
in
the
rows
were
filled
up
by
transplanting
and
the
ground
was
twice
ploughed
between
the
ridges
the
crop
here
is
very
fine
and
i
should
think
that
its
weight
could
not
be
less
than
tons
to
the
of
walter
palmer
swedes
five
acres
were
drilled
on
ridges
nearly
four
feet
apart
on
the
of
june
four
acres
on
the
of
june
and
an
acre
and
a
half
transplanted
after
vetches
on
the
of
august
the
weight
of
the
first
is
about
twenty
tons
to
the
acre
that
of
the
second
not
much
less
and
that
of
the
last
even
five
or
six
tons
the
first
two
pieces
were
mauled
to
pieces
by
the
but
the
gaps
were
filled
up
by
transplanting
the
ground
being
digged
on
the
tops
of
the
ridges
to
receive
the
plants
so
that
perhaps
a
third
part
or
more
of
the
crop
is
due
to
the
as
to
the
last
piece
that
transplanted
on
the
of
august
after
vetches
it
is
clear
that
there
could
have
been
no
crop
without
transplanting
and
after
all
the
crop
is
by
no
means
a
bad
it
is
clear
enough
to
me
that
this
system
will
finally
prevail
all
over
england
the
loyal
indeed
may
be
afraid
to
adopt
it
lest
it
should
contain
something
of
radicalism
fools
they
will
find
something
to
do
i
believe
soon
besides
railing
against
we
will
din
and
in
their
ears
till
they
shall
dread
the
din
as
much
as
a
dog
does
the
sound
of
the
bell
that
is
tied
to
the
whip
monday
returned
this
morning
and
rode
about
the
farm
and
also
about
that
of
winnal
where
i
saw
for
the
first
time
a
plough
going
being
the
man
drove
the
three
horses
that
drew
the
plough
and
carried
the
plough
round
at
the
ends
but
left
it
to
itself
the
rest
of
the
time
there
was
a
skim
coulter
that
turned
the
sward
in
under
the
furrow
and
the
work
was
done
very
neatly
this
gentleman
has
six
acres
of
on
ridges
four
feet
apart
with
a
distance
of
thirty
inches
between
the
plants
on
the
ridge
he
has
weighed
one
of
what
he
deemed
an
average
weight
and
found
it
to
weigh
fifteen
pounds
without
the
stump
now
as
there
are
upon
an
acre
the
weight
of
the
acres
is
all
but
pounds
this
is
a
prodigious
crop
and
it
is
peculiarly
well
suited
for
food
for
sheep
at
this
season
of
the
year
indeed
it
is
good
for
any
oxen
cows
pigs
all
like
these
loaved
cabbages
for
hogs
in
yard
after
the
stubbles
are
gone
and
before
the
tops
of
the
swedes
come
in
what
masses
of
manure
may
be
created
by
this
means
but
above
all
things
for
to
feed
off
upon
the
ground
common
turnips
have
not
half
the
substance
in
them
weight
for
weight
then
they
are
in
the
ground
they
are
and
in
wet
weather
the
sheep
must
starve
or
eat
a
great
deal
of
dirt
this
very
day
for
instance
what
a
sorry
sight
is
a
flock
of
fatting
sheep
upon
turnips
what
a
mess
of
dirt
and
stubble
the
cabbage
stands
boldly
up
above
the
ground
and
the
sheep
eats
it
all
up
without
treading
a
morsel
in
the
dirt
winnal
has
a
large
flock
of
sheep
feeding
on
his
cabbages
which
they
will
have
finished
perhaps
by
january
this
gentleman
also
has
some
as
they
call
them
in
norfolk
a
part
of
his
crop
is
on
ridges
feet
apart
with
on
the
ridge
a
part
on
feet
ridges
with
row
on
the
ridge
i
can
not
see
that
anything
is
gained
in
weight
by
the
double
rows
i
think
that
there
may
be
nearly
twenty
tons
to
the
acre
another
piece
winnal
transplanted
after
vetches
they
are
very
fine
and
altogether
he
has
a
crop
that
any
one
but
a
farmer
might
envy
this
is
really
the
system
of
husbandry
means
to
the
root
going
to
the
and
the
main
principle
of
this
system
first
taught
by
is
that
the
of
the
plant
is
to
be
fed
by
while
it
is
growing
and
to
do
this
we
must
have
our
our
system
of
husbandry
is
happily
illustrative
of
our
system
of
politics
our
lines
of
movement
are
fair
and
straightforward
we
destroy
all
weeds
which
like
do
nothing
but
devour
the
sustenance
that
ought
to
feed
the
valuable
plants
our
plants
are
all
and
our
nations
of
swedes
and
of
cabbages
present
a
happy
uniformity
of
enjoyments
and
of
bulk
and
not
as
in
the
system
of
corruption
here
and
there
one
of
enormous
size
surrounded
by
thousands
of
poor
little
starveling
things
scarcely
distinguishable
by
the
keenest
eye
or
if
seen
seen
only
to
inspire
a
contempt
of
the
husbandman
the
norfolk
boys
are
therefore
right
in
calling
their
swedes
tuesday
rode
to
see
a
belonging
to
westphalin
which
contains
the
very
finest
trees
and
that
i
ever
saw
in
england
this
grove
is
worth
going
from
london
to
weston
to
see
the
lady
who
is
very
much
beloved
in
her
neighbourhood
is
apparently
of
the
and
her
house
and
gardens
situated
in
a
beautiful
dell
form
i
think
the
most
comfortable
looking
thing
of
the
kind
that
i
ever
saw
if
she
had
known
that
i
was
in
her
grove
i
dare
say
she
would
have
expected
it
to
blaze
up
in
flames
or
at
least
that
i
was
come
to
view
the
premises
previous
to
confiscation
i
can
forgive
persons
like
her
but
i
can
not
forgive
the
parsons
and
others
who
have
misled
them
westphalin
if
she
live
many
years
will
find
that
the
best
friends
of
the
owners
of
the
land
are
those
who
have
endeavoured
to
produce
such
reform
of
the
as
would
have
prevented
the
ruin
of
this
parish
of
weston
is
remarkable
for
having
a
rector
has
constantly
resided
for
twenty
i
do
not
believe
that
there
is
an
instance
to
match
this
in
the
whole
kingdom
however
the
gentleman
may
be
assured
that
before
many
years
have
passed
over
their
heads
they
will
be
very
glad
to
reside
in
their
parsonage
houses
wednesday
rode
to
the
forest
of
dean
up
a
very
steep
hill
the
lanes
here
are
between
high
banks
and
on
the
sides
of
the
hills
the
road
is
a
rock
the
water
having
long
ago
washed
all
the
earth
away
pretty
works
are
i
find
carried
on
here
as
is
the
case
in
all
the
other
are
these
things
to
be
carried
on
in
this
way
here
is
a
domain
of
thirty
thousand
acres
of
the
finest
in
the
world
and
with
endless
is
this
can
not
each
acre
yield
ten
trees
a
year
are
not
these
trees
worth
a
pound
apiece
is
not
the
estate
worth
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
does
it
yield
to
the
to
whom
it
belongs
but
it
is
useless
to
waste
one
breath
in
this
way
we
must
have
a
of
the
without
it
the
whole
thing
will
fall
to
the
only
good
purpose
that
these
forests
answer
is
that
of
furnishing
a
place
of
being
to
labourers
families
on
their
skirts
and
here
their
cottages
are
very
neat
and
the
people
look
hearty
and
well
just
as
they
do
round
the
forests
in
hampshire
every
cottage
has
a
pig
or
two
these
graze
in
the
forest
and
in
the
fall
eat
acorns
and
and
the
seed
of
the
ash
for
these
last
as
well
as
the
others
are
very
full
of
oil
and
a
pig
that
is
put
to
his
shifts
will
pick
the
seed
very
nicely
out
from
the
husks
some
of
these
foresters
keep
cows
and
all
of
them
have
bits
of
ground
cribbed
of
course
at
different
times
from
the
forest
and
to
what
better
use
can
the
ground
be
put
i
saw
several
wheat
stubbles
from
rods
to
rods
i
asked
one
man
how
much
wheat
he
had
from
about
rods
he
said
more
than
two
bushels
here
is
bread
for
three
weeks
or
more
perhaps
and
a
winter
straw
for
the
pig
besides
are
these
things
nothing
the
dead
limbs
and
old
roots
of
the
forest
give
and
how
happy
are
these
people
compared
with
the
poor
creatures
about
great
bedwin
and
cricklade
where
they
have
neither
land
nor
shelter
and
where
i
saw
the
girls
carrying
home
bean
and
wheat
stubble
for
fuel
those
countries
always
but
badly
furnished
with
fuel
the
desolating
and
damnable
system
of
by
sweeping
away
small
homesteads
and
laying
ten
farms
into
one
has
literally
of
all
shelter
for
the
labourer
a
farmer
in
such
cases
has
a
whole
domain
in
his
hands
and
this
not
only
to
the
manifest
injury
of
the
public
at
large
but
in
violation
of
positive
the
poor
forger
is
hanged
but
where
is
the
prosecutor
of
the
monopolizing
farmer
though
the
is
as
clear
in
the
one
case
as
in
the
other
but
it
required
this
infernal
system
to
render
every
wholesome
regulation
nugatory
and
to
reduce
to
such
abject
misery
a
people
famed
in
all
ages
for
the
goodness
of
their
food
and
their
dress
there
is
one
farmer
in
the
north
of
hampshire
who
has
nearly
eight
thousand
acres
of
land
in
his
hands
who
grows
fourteen
hundred
acres
of
wheat
and
two
thousand
acres
of
barley
he
occupies
what
was
formerly
farms
is
it
any
wonder
that
and
is
there
not
here
cause
enough
for
the
increase
of
without
resorting
to
the
doctrine
of
the
barbarous
and
impious
malthus
and
his
assistants
the
of
the
edinburgh
review
those
eulogists
and
understrappers
of
the
this
farmer
has
done
nothing
some
one
will
say
i
say
he
has
for
there
is
a
law
to
forbid
him
thus
to
monopolize
land
but
no
matter
the
laws
the
management
of
the
affairs
of
a
nation
to
be
such
as
to
prevent
the
existence
of
the
temptation
to
such
and
even
now
the
evil
ought
to
be
remedied
and
could
be
remedied
in
the
space
of
half
a
dozen
years
the
disappearance
of
the
would
do
the
thing
in
time
but
this
might
be
assisted
by
legislative
in
returning
from
the
forest
we
were
overtaken
by
my
son
whom
i
had
begged
to
come
from
london
to
see
this
beautiful
country
on
the
we
saw
two
fellows
in
long
and
bundles
in
their
hands
going
into
a
cottage
what
do
you
deal
in
said
i
to
one
of
them
who
had
not
yet
entered
the
house
in
the
said
he
and
i
find
that
vagabonds
of
this
description
are
seen
all
over
the
country
with
in
their
pockets
they
vend
and
the
first
to
bring
the
body
into
a
debilitated
state
the
second
to
finish
the
corporeal
part
of
the
business
and
the
third
to
prepare
the
spirit
for
its
separation
from
the
clay
never
was
a
system
so
well
calculated
as
the
present
to
degrade
debase
and
enslave
a
people
law
and
as
if
that
were
not
sufficient
enormous
subscriptions
are
made
everything
that
can
be
done
is
done
to
favour
these
perambulatory
impostors
in
their
depredations
on
the
ignorant
while
everything
that
can
be
done
is
done
to
prevent
them
from
reading
or
from
hearing
of
anything
that
has
a
tendency
to
give
them
rational
notions
or
to
better
their
lot
however
all
is
not
buried
in
ignorance
down
the
deep
and
beautiful
valley
between
penyard
hill
and
the
hills
on
the
side
of
the
forest
of
dean
there
runs
a
stream
of
water
on
that
stream
of
water
there
is
a
in
that
there
is
a
set
of
workmen
that
set
of
workmen
do
i
am
told
the
and
have
taken
it
for
years
it
was
to
these
good
and
sensible
men
it
is
supposed
that
the
of
the
of
weston
church
upon
my
arrival
was
to
be
ascribed
for
nobody
that
i
visited
had
any
knowledge
of
the
cause
what
a
subject
for
lamentation
with
corrupt
hypocrites
that
even
on
this
secluded
spot
there
should
be
a
leaven
of
no
is
not
enveloped
in
brute
ignorance
yet
in
spite
of
every
artifice
that
hellish
corruption
has
been
able
to
employ
in
spite
of
all
her
menaces
and
all
her
brutalities
and
cruelties
hall
thursday
we
came
this
morning
from
bollitree
to
and
thence
to
this
place
ross
is
an
town
but
it
is
very
beautifully
situated
and
if
there
is
little
of
in
the
appearance
of
the
inhabitants
there
is
also
little
of
it
is
a
good
plain
country
town
or
settlement
of
tradesmen
whose
business
is
that
of
supplying
the
wants
of
the
cultivators
of
the
soil
it
presents
to
us
nothing
of
rascality
and
roguishness
of
look
which
you
see
on
almost
every
visage
in
the
not
excepting
the
visages
of
the
women
i
can
tell
a
from
another
upon
my
entrance
into
it
by
the
nasty
cunning
leering
designing
look
of
the
people
a
look
between
that
of
a
bad
for
are
good
methodist
parson
and
that
of
a
pickpocket
i
remember
and
i
never
shall
forget
the
horrid
looks
of
the
villains
in
devonshire
and
cornwall
some
people
say
o
it
is
not
fault
no
whose
fault
is
it
then
the
miscreants
who
bribe
them
true
that
these
deserve
the
halter
and
some
of
them
may
have
it
yet
but
are
not
the
takers
of
the
bribes
guilty
if
we
be
so
very
lenient
here
pray
let
us
ascribe
to
the
all
the
acts
of
thieves
and
robbers
so
we
do
but
we
the
thieves
and
robbers
nevertheless
it
is
no
very
unprovoking
reflection
that
from
these
sinks
of
atrocious
villany
come
a
very
considerable
part
of
the
men
to
fill
places
of
emolument
and
trust
what
a
clog
upon
a
minister
to
have
people
bred
in
such
scenes
forced
upon
him
and
why
does
this
curse
continue
however
its
natural
consequences
are
before
us
and
are
coming
on
pretty
fast
upon
each
other
heels
there
are
the
landlords
and
farmers
in
a
state
of
absolute
ruin
there
is
the
debt
pulling
the
nation
down
like
as
a
stone
pulls
a
dog
under
water
the
system
seems
to
have
fairly
wound
itself
up
to
have
tied
itself
hand
and
foot
with
cords
of
its
own
spinning
this
is
the
town
to
which
pope
has
given
an
interest
in
our
minds
by
his
eulogium
on
the
of
a
portrait
of
whom
is
hanging
up
in
a
house
in
which
i
now
the
market
at
ross
was
very
no
wheat
in
demand
no
buyers
it
must
lord
liverpool
a
bad
harvest
has
assuredly
failed
fowls
a
couple
a
goose
from
to
a
turkey
from
to
let
a
turkey
come
down
to
as
in
france
and
then
we
shall
soon
be
to
rights
a
whole
day
most
delightfully
passed
a
with
a
pretty
pack
of
hounds
kept
here
by
palmer
they
put
me
upon
a
horse
that
seemed
to
have
been
made
on
purpose
for
me
strong
tall
gentle
and
bold
and
that
carried
me
either
over
or
through
everything
i
who
am
just
the
weight
of
a
sack
of
good
wheat
actually
sat
on
his
back
from
daylight
in
the
morning
to
dusk
about
nine
hours
without
once
setting
my
foot
on
the
ground
our
ground
was
at
orcop
a
place
about
four
miles
distance
from
this
place
we
found
a
hare
in
a
few
minutes
after
throwing
off
and
in
the
course
of
the
day
we
had
to
find
four
and
were
never
more
than
ten
minutes
in
finding
a
steep
and
naked
ridge
lying
between
two
flat
valleys
having
a
mixture
of
pretty
large
fields
and
small
woods
formed
our
ground
the
hares
crossed
the
ridge
forward
and
backward
and
gave
us
numerous
views
and
very
fine
i
never
rode
on
such
steep
ground
before
and
really
in
going
up
and
down
some
of
the
craggy
places
where
the
rains
had
washed
the
earth
from
the
rocks
i
did
think
once
or
twice
of
my
neck
and
how
sidmouth
would
like
to
see
as
to
the
as
some
pretend
of
this
sport
that
point
i
have
i
think
settled
in
one
of
the
chapters
of
my
residence
in
as
to
the
expense
a
pack
even
a
full
pack
of
harriers
like
this
costs
less
than
two
bottles
of
wine
a
day
with
their
inseparable
concomitants
and
as
to
the
thus
spent
hunting
is
inseparable
from
and
with
habits
of
early
rising
who
ever
wanted
time
for
any
business
saturday
we
left
old
hall
where
we
always
breakfasted
by
this
morning
after
breakfast
returned
to
bollitree
took
the
hereford
coach
as
it
passed
about
noon
and
came
in
it
through
gloucester
cheltenham
northleach
burford
whitney
and
on
to
this
city
where
we
arrived
about
ten
i
could
not
leave
without
bringing
with
me
the
most
pleasing
impressions
it
is
not
for
one
to
descend
to
particulars
in
characterising
one
personal
friends
and
therefore
i
will
content
myself
with
saying
that
the
treatment
i
met
with
in
this
beautiful
county
where
i
saw
not
one
single
face
that
i
had
to
my
knowledge
ever
seen
before
was
much
more
than
sufficient
to
compensate
to
me
personally
for
all
the
atrocious
calumnies
which
for
twenty
years
i
have
had
to
endure
but
where
is
my
country
a
great
part
of
the
present
hideous
sufferings
of
which
will
by
every
reflecting
mind
be
easily
traced
to
these
calumnies
which
have
been
made
the
ground
or
pretext
for
rejecting
that
counsel
by
listening
to
which
those
sufferings
would
have
been
prevented
where
is
my
country
to
find
a
compensation
at
as
there
were
no
meals
on
the
road
we
furnished
ourselves
with
nuts
and
apples
which
first
a
handful
of
nuts
and
then
an
apple
are
i
can
assure
the
reader
excellent
and
most
wholesome
fare
they
say
that
nuts
of
all
sorts
are
unwholesome
if
they
had
been
i
should
never
have
written
registers
and
if
they
were
now
i
should
have
ceased
to
write
ere
this
for
upon
an
average
i
have
eaten
a
pint
a
day
since
i
left
home
in
short
i
could
be
very
well
content
to
live
on
nuts
milk
and
from
to
the
country
is
level
and
the
land
rich
and
good
the
fields
along
here
are
ploughed
in
ridges
about
feet
wide
and
the
angle
of
this
species
of
is
pretty
nearly
as
sharp
as
that
of
some
slated
roofs
of
houses
there
is
no
wet
under
it
is
the
top
wet
only
that
they
aim
at
keeping
from
doing
is
a
nasty
place
half
clown
and
half
cockney
the
town
is
one
street
about
a
mile
long
but
then
at
some
distance
from
this
street
there
are
rows
of
white
tenements
with
green
balconies
like
those
inhabited
by
the
round
london
indeed
this
place
appears
to
be
the
residence
of
an
assemblage
of
these
vermin
shift
about
between
london
cheltenham
bath
bognor
brighton
tunbridge
ramsgate
margate
worthing
and
other
spots
in
england
while
some
of
them
get
over
to
france
and
italy
just
like
those
of
different
sorts
that
are
found
in
different
parts
of
the
tormented
carcass
at
different
hours
of
the
day
and
night
and
in
different
degrees
of
heat
and
cold
cheltenham
is
at
the
foot
of
a
part
of
that
chain
of
hills
which
form
the
sides
of
that
which
i
described
as
resembling
the
vale
of
gloucester
soon
after
quitting
this
resort
of
the
lame
and
the
lazy
the
gormandizing
and
guzzling
the
bilious
and
the
nervous
we
proceeded
on
between
stone
walls
over
a
country
little
better
than
that
from
cirencester
to
a
very
poor
dull
and
uninteresting
country
all
the
way
to
oxford
hants
sunday
we
left
oxford
early
and
went
on
through
berks
to
it
is
a
saying
hereabouts
that
at
oxford
they
make
the
living
pay
for
the
dead
which
is
precisely
according
to
the
having
smarted
on
this
account
we
were
afraid
to
eat
again
at
an
inn
so
we
pushed
on
through
ilsley
towards
newbury
breakfasting
upon
the
residue
of
the
nuts
aided
by
a
new
supply
of
apples
bought
from
a
poor
man
who
exhibited
them
in
his
window
inspired
like
don
quixote
by
the
of
the
and
recollecting
the
last
bill
i
exclaimed
happy
thrice
happy
and
blessed
that
golden
age
when
men
lived
on
the
simple
fruits
of
the
earth
and
slaked
their
thirst
at
the
pure
and
limpid
brook
when
the
trees
shed
their
leaves
to
form
a
couch
for
their
repose
and
cast
their
bark
to
furnish
them
with
a
canopy
happy
age
when
no
oxford
landlord
charged
two
men
who
had
dropped
into
a
common
room
and
who
had
swallowed
three
pennyworths
of
food
shillings
for
and
pence
for
shillings
for
and
in
this
common
and
shillings
for
this
was
a
sort
of
grace
before
meat
to
the
nuts
and
apples
and
it
had
much
more
merit
than
the
harangue
of
don
quixote
for
he
before
he
began
upon
the
nuts
had
stuffed
himself
well
with
goat
flesh
and
wine
whereas
we
had
absolutely
from
the
and
blazing
fire
at
upon
beholding
the
masses
of
buildings
at
oxford
devoted
to
what
they
call
i
could
not
help
reflecting
on
the
drones
that
they
contain
and
the
wasps
they
send
forth
however
malignant
as
some
are
the
great
and
prevalent
characteristic
is
emptiness
of
head
want
of
talent
and
one
half
of
the
fellows
who
are
what
they
call
here
are
unfit
to
be
clerks
in
a
grocer
or
as
i
looked
up
at
what
they
call
i
could
not
help
reflecting
that
what
i
had
written
even
since
i
left
kensington
on
the
of
october
would
produce
more
effect
and
do
more
good
in
the
world
than
all
that
had
for
a
hundred
years
been
written
by
all
the
members
of
this
university
who
devour
perhaps
not
less
than
million
pounds
a
arising
from
property
completely
at
the
disposal
of
the
great
council
of
the
nation
and
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
to
myself
stand
forth
ye
ye
gloriously
feeding
doctors
stand
forth
ye
of
that
church
whose
have
had
given
them
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
not
out
of
your
riches
but
out
of
the
raised
in
part
from
the
of
the
labouring
man
stand
forth
and
face
me
who
have
from
the
pen
of
my
leisure
hours
sent
amongst
your
flocks
a
hundred
thousand
sermons
in
ten
months
more
than
you
have
all
done
for
the
last
half
century
i
exclaimed
in
vain
i
dare
say
for
it
was
at
peep
of
day
that
not
a
man
of
them
had
yet
endeavoured
to
unclose
his
in
coming
abingdon
berks
i
could
not
help
thinking
of
that
great
financier
john
maberly
by
whom
this
place
has
i
believe
the
honour
to
be
represented
in
the
collective
wisdom
of
the
in
the
way
to
ilsley
we
came
across
a
part
of
that
fine
tract
of
land
called
the
of
where
they
grow
and
one
after
another
for
many
years
together
about
three
miles
before
we
reached
ilsley
we
came
to
with
as
is
always
the
case
chalk
under
between
ilsley
and
newbury
the
country
is
enclosed
the
land
middling
a
stony
loam
the
woods
and
coppices
frequent
and
neither
very
good
till
we
came
within
a
short
distance
of
newbury
in
going
along
we
saw
a
piece
of
wheat
with
laid
all
over
it
at
the
distance
perhaps
of
eight
or
ten
feet
from
each
other
it
was
to
catch
the
the
slugs
which
commit
their
depredations
in
the
creep
under
the
leaves
in
the
morning
and
by
turning
up
the
leaves
you
come
at
the
slugs
and
crush
them
or
carry
them
away
but
besides
the
immense
daily
labour
attending
this
the
slug
in
a
field
sowed
with
wheat
has
a
to
creep
under
at
every
foot
and
will
not
go
five
feet
to
get
under
a
then
again
if
the
day
be
the
slug
works
by
day
as
well
as
by
night
it
is
the
sun
and
drought
that
he
shuns
and
not
the
light
therefore
the
only
effectual
way
to
destroy
slugs
is
to
sow
lime
in
dust
and
the
slug
is
wet
he
has
hardly
any
skin
his
is
his
covering
the
smallest
dust
of
hot
lime
kills
him
and
a
few
bushels
to
the
acre
are
sufficient
you
must
sow
the
lime
at
for
then
the
slugs
are
sure
to
be
out
slugs
come
after
a
crop
that
has
long
afforded
a
great
deal
of
shelter
from
the
sun
such
as
peas
and
vetches
in
gardens
they
are
nursed
up
by
strawberry
beds
and
by
weeds
by
asparagus
beds
or
by
anything
that
remains
for
a
long
time
to
keep
the
from
the
earth
we
got
about
three
to
this
nice
snug
little
farmhouse
and
found
our
host
budd
at
home
monday
a
thorough
wet
day
the
only
day
the
greater
part
of
which
i
have
not
spent
out
of
doors
since
i
left
home
tuesday
with
budd
we
rode
to
see
the
of
at
in
berkshire
budd
did
the
same
thing
with
arthur
young
years
ago
it
was
a
sort
of
but
as
the
distance
was
ten
miles
we
thought
it
best
to
perform
it
on
we
passed
through
the
parish
of
where
they
have
worth
as
tillage
land
not
one
single
farthing
an
acre
and
never
will
and
never
can
be
as
a
common
it
afforded
a
little
picking
for
geese
and
asses
and
in
the
moory
parts
of
it
a
little
fuel
for
the
labourers
but
now
it
really
can
afford
nothing
it
will
all
fall
to
common
again
by
degrees
this
madness
this
blind
eagerness
to
gain
is
now
i
hope
pretty
nearly
at
we
passed
the
house
of
a
goddard
which
is
uninhabited
he
residing
at
at
berks
is
the
estate
of
sloper
a
very
pretty
place
a
beautiful
sporting
country
large
fields
small
woods
dry
soil
what
has
taken
place
here
is
an
instance
of
the
workings
of
the
system
here
is
a
large
gentleman
house
but
the
proprietor
it
is
just
now
empty
and
resides
in
a
and
farms
his
own
estate
happy
is
the
landlord
who
has
the
good
sense
to
do
this
in
time
this
is
a
fine
farm
and
here
appears
to
be
very
judicious
farming
large
tracts
of
turnips
clean
land
stubbles
ploughed
up
early
ploughing
with
oxen
and
a
very
large
and
singularly
fine
flock
of
sheep
everything
that
you
see
land
stock
implements
fences
buildings
all
do
credit
to
the
owner
bespeak
his
sound
judgment
his
industry
and
care
all
that
is
wanted
here
is
the
because
that
would
enable
the
owner
to
keep
three
times
the
quantity
of
stock
however
since
i
left
home
i
have
seen
but
very
few
farms
that
i
should
prefer
to
that
of
sloper
whom
i
have
not
the
pleasure
to
know
and
whom
indeed
i
never
heard
of
till
i
saw
his
farm
at
a
village
certainly
named
by
some
called
we
passed
a
neat
little
house
and
paddock
the
residence
of
a
butler
a
nephew
of
butler
who
died
bishop
of
oxford
and
whom
i
can
remember
hearing
preach
at
farnham
in
surrey
when
i
was
a
very
very
little
boy
i
have
his
features
and
his
wig
as
clearly
in
my
recollection
as
if
i
had
seen
them
but
yesterday
and
i
dare
say
i
have
not
thought
of
doctor
butler
for
forty
years
before
the
loyal
oh
the
pious
gang
will
say
that
my
memory
is
good
as
to
the
face
and
wig
but
bad
as
to
the
doctor
why
i
must
confess
that
i
have
no
recollection
of
them
but
then
do
i
not
sermons
at
about
two
miles
from
inkpen
we
came
to
the
end
of
our
pilgrimage
the
farm
which
was
where
he
used
the
first
drill
that
ever
was
used
where
he
practised
his
husbandry
where
he
wrote
that
book
which
does
so
much
honour
to
his
memory
and
to
which
the
cultivators
of
england
owe
so
much
this
farm
is
on
an
open
and
somewhat
bleak
spot
in
berkshire
on
the
borders
of
wiltshire
and
within
a
very
short
distance
of
a
part
of
hampshire
the
ground
is
a
loam
mixed
with
flints
and
has
the
chalk
at
no
great
distance
beneath
it
it
is
therefore
free
from
needs
no
water
furrows
and
is
pretty
good
in
its
nature
the
house
which
has
been
improved
by
blandy
the
present
proprietor
is
still
but
a
plain
farmhouse
blandy
has
lived
here
thirty
years
and
has
brought
up
ten
children
to
man
and
woman
estate
blandy
was
from
home
but
blandy
received
and
entertained
us
in
a
very
hospitable
we
returned
not
along
the
low
land
but
along
the
top
of
the
downs
and
through
lord
caernarvon
park
and
got
home
after
a
very
pleasant
day
wednesday
we
intended
to
have
a
hunt
but
the
foxhounds
came
across
and
rendered
it
impracticable
as
an
instance
of
the
change
which
rural
customs
have
undergone
since
the
hellish
has
been
so
furiously
at
work
i
need
only
mention
the
fact
that
forty
years
ago
there
were
packs
of
and
packs
of
kept
within
of
newbury
and
that
now
there
is
of
the
former
kept
too
by
and
of
the
latter
except
the
few
couple
of
dogs
kept
by
budd
so
much
the
better
says
the
shallow
fool
who
can
not
duly
estimate
the
difference
between
a
resident
gentry
attached
to
the
soil
known
to
every
farmer
and
labourer
from
their
childhood
frequently
mixing
with
them
in
those
pursuits
where
all
artificial
distinctions
are
lost
practicing
hospitality
without
ceremony
from
habit
and
not
on
calculation
and
a
gentry
only
residing
at
all
having
no
relish
for
foreign
in
their
manners
distant
and
haughty
in
their
behaviour
looking
to
the
soil
only
for
its
rents
viewing
it
as
a
mere
object
of
speculation
unacquainted
with
its
cultivators
despising
them
and
their
pursuits
and
relying
for
influence
not
upon
the
good
will
of
the
vicinage
but
upon
the
dread
of
their
power
the
war
and
has
brought
in
nabobs
generals
admirals
governors
commissaries
contractors
pensioners
sinecurists
commissioners
bankers
not
to
mention
the
long
and
in
gowns
and
wigs
you
can
see
but
few
good
houses
not
in
possession
of
one
or
the
other
of
these
these
with
the
parsons
are
now
the
magistrates
some
of
the
are
before
us
but
they
have
not
all
yet
arrived
a
taxation
that
sucks
up
fifty
millions
a
year
produce
a
new
set
of
proprietors
every
twenty
years
or
less
and
the
proprietors
while
they
last
can
be
little
better
than
to
the
government
and
scourgers
of
the
i
must
not
quit
without
noticing
budd
swedes
and
other
things
his
is
but
miniature
farming
but
it
is
very
good
and
very
interesting
some
time
in
may
he
drilled
a
piece
of
swedes
on
four
feet
ridges
the
fly
took
them
off
he
had
cabbage
and
plants
to
put
in
their
stead
unwilling
to
turn
back
the
ridges
and
thereby
bring
the
dung
to
the
top
he
planted
the
cabbages
and
on
the
ridges
where
the
swedes
had
been
drilled
this
was
done
in
june
late
in
july
his
neighbour
a
farmer
hulbert
had
a
field
of
swedes
that
he
was
hoeing
budd
now
put
some
manure
in
the
furrows
between
the
ridges
and
ploughed
a
furrow
over
it
from
each
ridge
on
this
he
planted
swedes
taken
from
farmer
field
thus
his
plantation
consisted
of
rows
of
plants
feet
the
result
is
a
prodigious
crop
of
the
greens
and
all
he
has
not
less
than
twenty
tons
to
the
acre
he
can
scarcely
have
less
of
the
cabbages
some
of
which
are
as
fine
as
i
ever
saw
and
of
the
swedes
many
of
which
weigh
from
five
to
nine
pounds
he
certainly
has
more
than
twenty
tons
to
the
acre
so
that
here
is
a
crop
of
at
the
very
least
tons
to
the
this
piece
is
not
much
more
than
half
an
acre
but
he
will
perhaps
not
find
so
much
cattle
food
upon
any
four
acres
in
the
county
he
is
and
long
has
been
feeding
four
milch
cows
large
fine
and
in
fine
condition
upon
cabbages
sometimes
and
sometimes
on
leaves
the
butter
is
excellent
not
the
smallest
degree
of
bitterness
or
bad
taste
of
any
sort
fine
colour
and
fine
taste
and
here
upon
not
three
quarters
of
an
acre
of
ground
he
has
if
he
manage
the
thing
well
enough
food
for
these
four
cows
to
the
month
of
may
can
any
system
of
husbandry
equal
this
what
would
he
do
with
these
cows
if
he
had
not
this
crop
he
could
not
keep
one
of
them
except
on
hay
and
he
owes
all
this
crop
to
transplanting
he
thinks
that
the
transplanting
fetching
the
swede
plants
and
all
might
cost
him
ten
or
twelve
shillings
it
was
done
by
women
who
had
never
done
such
a
thing
however
he
must
get
in
his
crop
before
the
hard
weather
comes
or
my
lord
caernarvon
hares
will
help
him
they
have
begun
already
and
it
is
curious
that
they
have
begun
on
the
roots
so
that
hares
at
any
rate
have
set
the
seal
of
merit
upon
this
root
thursday
night
we
have
come
round
here
instead
of
going
by
newbury
in
consequence
of
a
promise
to
blount
at
uphusband
that
i
would
call
on
him
on
my
return
we
left
uphusband
by
and
of
course
we
could
see
little
on
our
way
friday
got
home
by
the
coach
at
leaving
whitchurch
we
soon
passed
the
mill
where
the
paper
is
made
thank
god
this
mill
is
likely
soon
to
want
employment
hard
by
is
a
pretty
park
and
house
belonging
to
portal
the
the
country
people
who
seldom
want
for
sarcastic
shrewdness
call
it
i
perceive
that
they
are
planting
oaks
on
the
as
the
call
them
about
which
is
very
good
because
the
herbage
after
the
first
year
is
rather
increased
than
diminished
by
the
operation
while
in
time
the
oaks
arrive
at
a
timber
state
and
add
to
the
beauty
and
to
the
of
the
country
and
to
the
real
and
solid
wealth
of
the
descendants
of
the
planter
who
in
every
such
case
merits
unequivocal
praise
because
he
plants
for
his
the
planter
here
is
lady
mildmay
who
is
it
seems
lady
of
the
manors
about
here
it
is
impossible
to
praise
this
act
of
hers
too
much
especially
when
one
considers
her
i
beg
a
thousand
pardons
i
do
not
mean
to
say
that
her
ladyship
is
but
she
has
long
had
if
her
ladyship
had
been
a
reader
of
old
and
johnson
that
teacher
of
moping
and
melancholy
she
never
would
have
planted
an
oak
tree
if
the
writings
of
this
mean
dastardly
old
pensioner
had
got
a
firm
hold
of
the
minds
of
the
people
at
large
the
people
would
have
been
bereft
of
their
very
souls
these
writings
aided
by
the
charm
of
pompous
sound
were
fast
making
their
way
till
light
reason
and
the
french
revolution
came
to
drive
them
into
oblivion
or
at
least
to
confine
them
to
the
shelves
of
repentant
married
old
rakes
and
those
of
old
with
young
wives
standing
in
need
of
something
to
keep
down
the
unruly
ebullitions
which
are
apt
to
take
place
while
the
dearies
are
gone
hobbling
to
after
comes
says
solomon
and
after
the
sight
of
lady
mildmay
truly
noble
plantations
came
that
of
the
clouts
of
the
gentlemen
cadets
of
the
military
college
of
here
close
by
the
road
side
is
the
sheets
shirts
and
all
sorts
of
things
were
here
spread
upon
lines
covering
perhaps
an
acre
of
ground
we
soon
afterwards
came
to
place
on
hill
and
is
there
never
to
be
an
of
these
things
away
to
the
left
we
see
that
immense
building
which
contains
children
up
to
be
military
has
this
plan
cost
so
little
as
two
millions
of
pounds
i
never
see
this
place
and
i
have
seen
it
forty
times
during
the
last
twenty
years
without
asking
myself
this
question
will
this
thing
be
suffered
to
go
on
will
this
thing
created
by
money
by
will
this
thing
be
upheld
by
means
of
taxes
the
interest
of
the
debt
is
on
the
ground
that
the
nation
is
to
pay
the
interest
in
answer
that

farm
near
faversham
this
is
the
first
time
since
i
went
to
france
in
that
i
have
been
on
this
side
of
the
land
generally
speaking
from
deptford
to
dartford
is
poor
and
the
surface
ugly
by
nature
to
which
ugliness
there
has
been
made
just
before
we
came
to
the
latter
place
a
considerable
addition
by
the
enclosure
of
a
common
and
by
the
sticking
up
of
some
houses
surrounded
with
dead
fences
and
things
called
gardens
in
all
manner
of
ridiculous
forms
making
all
together
the
bricks
and
earth
say
as
plainly
as
they
can
speak
here
dwell
and
this
is
a
little
excrescence
that
has
grown
out
of
the
immense
sums
which
have
been
drawn
from
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
to
be
expended
on
barracks
magazines
catamarans
and
all
the
excuses
for
lavish
expenditure
which
the
war
for
the
bourbons
gave
rise
to
all
things
will
return
these
rubbishy
flimsy
things
on
this
common
will
first
be
deserted
then
crumble
down
then
be
swept
away
and
the
cattle
sheep
pigs
and
geese
will
once
more
graze
upon
the
common
which
will
again
furnish
heath
furze
and
turf
for
the
labourers
on
the
neighbouring
after
you
leave
dartford
the
land
becomes
excellent
you
come
to
a
bottom
of
chalk
many
feet
from
the
surface
and
when
that
is
the
case
the
land
is
sure
to
be
good
no
at
bottom
no
deep
ditches
no
water
furrows
necessary
sufficiently
moist
in
dry
weather
and
no
water
lying
about
upon
it
in
wet
weather
for
any
length
of
time
the
chalk
acts
as
a
not
as
a
sieve
like
gravel
and
not
as
a
dish
like
clay
the
chalk
acts
as
the
soft
stone
in
herefordshire
does
but
it
is
not
so
congenial
to
trees
that
have
along
through
gravesend
towards
rochester
the
country
presents
a
sort
of
gardening
scene
rochester
the
bishop
of
which
is
or
lately
was
collector
for
london
and
is
a
small
but
crowded
place
lying
on
the
south
bank
of
the
beautiful
medway
with
a
rising
ground
on
the
other
side
of
the
city
which
you
pass
through
before
you
come
to
the
bridge
over
which
you
go
to
enter
rochester
itself
and
form
in
fact
one
main
street
of
about
two
miles
and
a
half
in
here
i
was
got
into
the
scenes
of
my
days
here
at
between
sixteen
and
seventeen
i
enlisted
for
a
soldier
upon
looking
up
towards
the
fortifications
and
the
barracks
how
many
recollections
crowded
into
my
mind
the
girls
in
these
towns
do
not
seem
to
be
as
they
were
years
ago
or
am
i
not
so
quick
in
discovering
beauties
as
i
was
then
have
years
corrected
my
taste
or
made
me
a
hypercritic
in
these
matters
is
it
that
i
now
look
at
them
with
the
solemnness
of
a
professional
man
and
not
with
the
enthusiasm
and
eagerness
of
an
amateur
i
leave
these
questions
for
philosophers
to
solve
one
thing
i
will
say
for
the
young
women
of
these
towns
and
that
is
that
i
always
found
those
of
them
that
i
had
the
great
happiness
to
be
acquainted
with
evince
a
sincere
desire
to
do
their
best
to
smooth
the
inequalities
of
life
and
to
give
us
brave
fellows
as
often
as
they
could
strong
beer
when
their
churlish
masters
of
fathers
or
husbands
would
have
drenched
us
to
death
with
small
this
at
the
of
life
gave
me
a
high
opinion
of
the
judgment
and
justice
of
the
female
sex
an
opinion
which
has
been
confirmed
by
the
observations
of
my
whole
this
chatham
has
had
some
monstrous
stuck
on
to
it
by
the
lavish
expenditure
of
the
war
these
will
moulder
away
it
is
curious
enough
that
i
should
meet
with
a
gentleman
in
an
inn
at
chatham
to
give
me
a
picture
of
the
in
that
enormous
wen
which
during
the
war
was
stuck
on
to
portsmouth
not
less
than
fifty
thousand
people
had
been
drawn
together
there
these
are
now
dispersing
the
coagulated
blood
is
diluting
and
flowing
back
through
the
veins
whole
streets
are
deserted
and
the
eyes
of
the
houses
knocked
out
by
the
boys
that
remain
the
jackdaws
as
much
as
to
say
our
turn
to
be
inspired
and
to
teach
is
come
are
beginning
to
take
possession
of
the
methodist
chapels
the
gentleman
told
me
that
he
had
been
down
to
portsea
to
sell
half
a
street
of
houses
left
him
by
a
relation
and
that
nobody
would
give
him
anything
for
them
further
than
as
very
cheap
fuel
and
rubbish
good
god
and
is
this
prosperity
is
this
the
prosperity
of
the
war
have
i
not
for
twenty
long
years
been
regretting
the
existence
of
these
unnatural
embossments
these
these
odious
wens
produced
by
and
engendering
crime
and
misery
and
slavery
we
shall
see
the
whole
of
these
wens
abandoned
by
the
inhabitants
and
at
last
the
cannons
on
the
fortifications
may
be
of
some
use
in
battering
down
the
but
what
is
to
be
the
fate
of
the
great
wen
of
all
the
monster
called
by
the
silly
coxcombs
of
the
press
the
metropolis
of
the
empire
what
is
to
become
of
that
multitude
of
towns
that
has
been
stuck
up
around
it
the
village
of
kingston
was
smothered
in
the
town
of
portsea
and
why
because
taxes
drained
from
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
were
brought
thither
the
dispersion
of
the
wen
is
the
only
real
difficulty
that
i
see
in
settling
the
affairs
of
the
nation
and
restoring
it
to
a
happy
state
but
dispersed
it
be
and
if
there
be
half
a
million
or
more
of
people
to
suffer
the
consolation
is
that
the
suffering
will
be
divided
into
half
a
million
of
parts
as
if
the
swelling
out
of
london
naturally
produced
by
the
funding
system
were
not
sufficient
as
if
the
evil
were
not
sufficiently
great
from
the
inevitable
tendency
of
the
system
of
loans
and
funds
our
pretty
gentlemen
must
resort
to
positive
institutions
to
augment
the
population
of
the
wen
they
found
that
the
increase
of
the
wen
produced
an
increase
of
thieves
and
prostitutes
an
increase
of
all
sorts
of
diseases
an
increase
of
miseries
of
all
sorts
they
saw
that
taxes
drawn
up
to
one
point
produced
these
effects
they
must
have
a
for
instance
to
check
the
evil
and
that
they
must
needs
have
in
the
wen
so
that
here
were
a
million
of
pounds
drawn
up
in
taxes
employed
not
only
to
keep
the
thieves
and
prostitutes
still
in
the
but
to
bring
up
to
the
wen
workmen
to
build
the
penitentiary
who
and
whose
families
amounting
perhaps
to
thousands
make
an
addition
to
the
cause
of
that
crime
and
misery
to
check
which
is
the
object
of
the
penitentiary
people
would
follow
they
must
follow
the
million
of
money
however
this
is
of
a
piece
with
all
the
rest
of
their
goings
on
they
and
their
predecessors
ministers
and
have
been
collecting
together
all
the
materials
for
a
dreadful
explosion
and
if
the
explosion
be
not
dreadful
other
heads
must
point
out
the
means
of
prevention
the
land
on
quitting
chatham
is
chalk
at
bottom
but
before
you
reach
sittingbourne
there
is
a
vein
of
gravel
and
sand
under
but
a
great
depth
of
loam
above
about
sittingbourne
the
chalk
bottom
comes
again
and
continues
on
to
this
place
where
the
land
appears
to
me
to
be
as
good
as
it
can
possibly
be
william
waller
at
whose
house
i
am
has
grown
this
year
the
roots
of
which
weigh
i
think
on
an
average
twelve
pounds
and
in
rows
too
at
only
about
thirty
inches
distant
from
each
other
in
short
as
far
as
goes
it
is
impossible
to
see
a
finer
country
than
this
you
frequently
see
a
field
of
fifty
acres
level
as
a
die
clean
as
a
garden
and
as
rich
need
not
have
crossed
the
atlantic
and
alleghany
into
the
bargain
to
look
for
land
rich
to
bear
for
here
is
a
plenty
of
it
in
short
this
is
a
country
of
cherry
apple
pear
and
filbert
orchards
and
hedges
but
alas
what
in
point
of
is
a
country
without
woods
and
lofty
trees
and
here
there
are
very
few
indeed
i
am
now
sitting
in
a
room
from
the
window
of
which
i
look
over
a
large
and
level
field
of
rich
land
in
which
the
drilled
wheat
is
finely
come
up
and
which
is
surrounded
by
clipped
quickset
hedges
with
a
row
of
apple
trees
running
by
the
sides
of
them
over
a
long
succession
of
rich
meadows
which
are
here
called
marshes
the
shortest
grass
upon
which
will
fatten
sheep
or
oxen
over
a
little
branch
of
the
salt
water
which
runs
up
to
faversham
on
the
isle
of
shepry
or
shepway
which
rises
a
little
into
a
sort
of
ridge
that
runs
along
it
rich
fields
pastures
and
orchards
lie
all
around
me
and
yet
i
declare
that
i
a
million
times
to
one
prefer
as
a
spot
to
the
heaths
the
miry
coppices
the
wild
woods
and
the
forests
of
sussex
and
hampshire
agricultural
distress
is
the
great
topic
of
general
conversation
the
seem
to
prevail
here
the
fact
is
farmers
in
general
read
nothing
but
the
newspapers
these
in
the
wen
are
under
the
control
of
the
corruption
of
one
or
the
other
of
the
factions
and
in
the
country
nine
times
out
of
ten
under
the
control
of
the
parsons
and
landlords
who
are
the
magistrates
as
they
are
pompously
called
that
is
to
say
justices
of
the
peace
from
such
vehicles
what
are
farmers
to
learn
they
are
in
general
thoughtful
and
sensible
men
but
their
natural
good
sense
is
perverted
by
these
publications
had
it
not
been
for
which
we
never
should
have
seen
sudden
transition
from
war
to
lasting
seven
years
and
more
in
its
destructive
effects
at
last
than
at
first
edward
and
are
the
members
of
the
collective
wisdom
for
this
county
the
former
was
till
of
late
a
i
hear
that
he
is
a
great
advocate
for
i
suppose
he
does
not
wish
to
let
people
who
have
see
the
bottom
of
the
evil
he
may
get
his
rents
for
this
year
but
it
will
be
his
last
year
if
the
interest
of
the
debt
be
not
very
greatly
reduced
some
people
here
think
that
corn
is
even
now
perhaps
it
is
the
best
that
the
delusion
should
continue
for
a
year
longer
as
that
would
tend
to
make
the
destruction
of
the
system
more
sure
or
at
least
make
the
cure
more
radical
i
went
through
a
very
pretty
little
town
and
just
ten
minutes
walk
from
the
up
to
the
dover
here
are
the
that
hume
so
well
exposed
an
immensity
of
buildings
and
expensive
things
why
are
not
these
premises
let
or
sold
however
this
will
never
be
done
until
there
be
a
pretty
little
van
that
beauty
of
all
beauties
that
orator
of
all
orators
that
saint
of
all
saints
that
financier
of
all
financiers
said
that
if
hume
were
to
pare
down
the
expenses
of
government
to
wish
there
would
be
others
the
hunts
cobbetts
and
carliles
who
would
still
want
the
expense
to
be
less
i
do
not
know
hume
would
wish
to
go
but
for
myself
i
say
that
if
i
ever
have
the
power
to
do
it
i
will
reduce
the
expenditure
and
that
in
quick
time
too
down
to
what
it
was
in
the
reign
of
queen
anne
that
is
to
say
to
less
than
is
now
paid
to
for
their
labour
in
collecting
the
taxes
and
monstrous
as
van
may
think
the
idea
i
do
not
regard
it
as
impossible
that
i
may
have
such
power
which
i
would
certainly
not
employ
to
do
an
act
of
to
any
human
being
and
would
at
the
same
time
maintain
the
throne
in
more
real
splendour
than
that
in
which
it
is
now
maintained
but
i
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
vans
except
as
or
porters
came
home
very
much
pleased
with
my
visit
to
walker
in
whose
house
i
saw
no
drinking
of
wine
spirits
or
even
beer
where
all
even
to
the
little
children
were
up
by
in
the
morning
and
where
the
most
perfect
sobriety
was
accompanied
by
constant
cheerfulness
is
in
a
deplorable
way
the
farmers
are
skilful
and
intelligent
generally
speaking
but
there
is
infinite
in
kent
owing
partly
to
the
swarms
of
west
indians
nabobs
commissioners
and
others
of
nearly
the
same
description
that
have
selected
it
for
the
place
of
their
residence
but
owing
still
more
to
the
immense
sums
of
public
money
that
have
during
the
last
thirty
years
been
expended
in
it
and
when
one
thinks
of
these
the
conduct
of
the
people

other
places

the

does
them
everlasting
honour
the
in
kent
is
more
than
in
herefordshire
where
it
is
raised
for
while
in
kent
it
is
raised
for
sale
in
its
fruit
state
a
great
deal
being
sent
to
the
and
a
great
deal
sent
to
the
north

and
to
scotland
the
orchards
are
beautiful
indeed
kept
in
the
neatest
order
and
indeed
all
belonging
to
them
excels
anything
of
the
kind
to
be
seen
in
normandy
and
as
to
apples
i
never
saw
any
so
good
in
france
as
those
of
kent
this
county
so
blessed
by
providence
has
been
cursed
by
the
system
in
a
peculiar
degree
it
has
been
the
of
immense
sums
raised
on
the
other
counties
this
has
puffed
its
to
an
unnatural
height
and
now
that
the
drain
of
other
counties
is
stopped
it
feels
like
a
pampered
pony
turned
out
in
winter
to
live
upon
a
common
it
is
in
an
extremely
unsatisfactory
state
and
has
certainly
a
greater
mass
of
suffering
to
endure
than
any
other
part
of
the
kingdom
the
only
excepted
sir
edward
knatchbull
who
is
a
child
of
the
system
does
appear
to
see
no
more
of
the
cause
of
these
sufferings
than
if
he
were
a
baby
how
should
he
not
very
bright
by
nature
never
listening
but
to
one
side
of
the
question
being
a
man
who
wants
high
rents
to
be
paid
him
not
gifted
with
much
light
and
that
little
having
to
strive
against
prejudice
false
shame
and
self
interest
what
wonder
is
there
that
he
should
not
see
things
in
their
true
light
norfolk

journal
near

monday
from
the
to
norwich
from
which
i
am
now
distant
seven
miles
there
is
nothing
in
essex
suffolk
or
this
county
that
can
be
called
a
essex
when
you
get
beyond
the
immediate
influence
of
the
gorgings
and
disgorgings
of
the

that
is
to
say
beyond
the
demand
for
crude

and
repayment
in
manure
is
by
no
means
a
fertile
county
there
appears
generally
to
be
a
bottom
of
not
which
they
persist
in
calling
clay
in
norfolk
i
wish
i
had
one
of
these
norfolk
men
in
a
coppice
in
hampshire
or
sussex
and
i
would
show
him
what
is
clay
is
what
pots
and
pans
and
jugs
and
tiles
are
made
of
and
not
soft
whitish
stuff
that
crumbles
to
pieces
in
the
sun
instead
of
baking
as
hard
as
a
stone
and
which
in
dry
weather
is
to
be
broken
to
pieces
by
nothing
short
of
a
the
narrow
ridges
on
which
the
wheat
is
sown
the
water
furrows
the
water
standing
in
the
dips
of
the
pastures
the
rusty
colour
of
the
water
coming
out
of
some
of
the
banks
the
deep
ditches
the
rusty
look
of
the
pastures
all
show
that
here
is
a
bottom
of
clay
yet
there
is
gravel
too
for
the
oaks
do
not
grow
well
it
was
not
till
i
got
nearly
to
sudbury
that
i
saw
much
change
for
the
better
here
the
bottom
of
chalk
the
soft
chalk
that
the
norfolk
people
call
clay
begins
to
be
the
bottom
and
this
with
very
little
exception
as
far
as
i
have
been
is
the
bottom
of
all
the
lands
of
these
two
fine
counties
of
suffolk
and
sudbury
has
some
fine
meadows
near
it
on
the
sides
of
the
river
stour
the
land
all
along
to
bury
saint
edmund
is
very
fine
but
no
trees
worth
looking
at
formerly
the
seat
of
an
abbot
the
last
of
whom
was
i
think
hanged
or
somehow
put
to
death
by
that
matchless
tyrant
henry
is
a
very
pretty
place
extremely
clean
and
neat
no
ragged
or
dirty
people
to
be
seen
and
women
ones
i
mean
very
pretty
and
very
neatly
on
this
side
of
bury
a
considerable
distance
lower
i
saw
a
field
of
transplanted
very
thick
for
i
suppose
sheep
feed
in
the
spring
the
farming
all
along
to
norwich
is
very
good
the
land
clean
and
everything
done
in
a
masterly
manner
samuel
clarke
my
host
has
about
acres
of
in
rows
some
at
feet
distances
some
at
inches
and
about
acres
of
the
swedes
were
transplanted
i
have
seen
thousands
of
acres
of
swedes
in
these
counties
and
here
are
the
largest
crops
that
i
have
seen
the
widest
rows
are
decidedly
the
largest
crops
here
and
the
though
under
disadvantageous
circumstances
amongst
the
best
of
the
best
the
wide
rows
amount
to
at
least
tons
to
the
acre
exclusive
of
the
greens
taken
off
two
months
ago
which
weighed
tons
to
the
acre
then
there
is
the
inter
tillage
so
beneficial
to
the
land
and
the
small
quantity
of
manure
required
in
the
broad
rows
compared
to
what
is
required
when
the
seed
is
drilled
or
sown
upon
the
level
nicholls
a
neighbour
of
clarke
has
a
part
of
a
field
transplanted
on
turn
put
in
when
in
the
other
part
of
the
field
drilled
the
plants
were
a
fortnight
old
he
has
a
much
larger
crop
in
the
transplanted
than
in
the
drilled
part
but
if
it
had
been
a
he
might
have
had
in
the
drilled
part
while
in
all
probability
the
crop
in
the
transplanted
part
would
have
been
better
than
it
now
is
seeing
that
a
summer
though
favourable
to
the
hitting
of
the
swedes
is
by
no
means
favourable
to
their
attaining
a
great
size
of
bulb
this
is
the
case
this
year
with
all
turnips
a
great
deal
of
leaf
and
neck
but
not
bulbs
in
proportion
the
advantages
of
transplanting
are
you
make
sure
of
a
crop
in
spite
of
fly
and
you
have
six
weeks
or
two
months
longer
to
prepare
your
ground
and
the
advantages
of
wide
rows
are
that
you
want
only
about
half
the
quantity
of
manure
and
that
you
the
ground
two
or
three
times
during
the
summer
near
holt
thursday
came
to
the
grove
withers
near
holt
along
with
clarke
through
to
and
then
to
on
our
road
we
passed
the
house
of
the
late
who
married
castlereagh
sister
who
is
a
daughter
of
the
late
earl
of
buckinghamshire
who
had
for
so
many
years
that
thumping
sinecure
of
eleven
thousand
a
year
in
ireland
and
who
was
the
son
of
a
man
that
under
the
name
of
hobart
cut
such
a
figure
in
supporting
lord
north
and
afterwards
pitt
and
was
made
a
peer
under
the
auspices
of
the
latter
of
these
two
ministers
this
house
which
is
a
very
ancient
one
was
they
say
the
of
ann
de
boleyne
the
mother
of
queen
elizabeth
not
much
matter
for
she
married
the
king
while
his
real
wife
was
alive
i
could
have
excused
her
if
there
had
been
no
marrying
in
the
case
but
hypocrisy
always
bad
becomes
detestable
when
it
resorts
to
religious
ceremony
as
its
mask
she
no
more
than
cranmer
seems
to
her
last
moments
to
have
remembered
her
sins
against
her
lawful
queen
fox
of
that
ought
to
be
called
the
of
says
that
cranmer
the
recanter
and
held
out
his
offending
hand
in
the
flames
and
cried
out
that
hand
that
hand
if
he
had
cried
out
catherine
i
should
have
thought
better
of
him
but
it
is
clear
that
the
whole
story
is
a
lie
invented
by
the
protestants
and
particularly
by
the
sectarians
to
the
character
of
this
perfidious
hypocrite
and
double
apostate
who
if
bigotry
had
something
to
do
in
bringing
him
to
the
stake
certainly
deserved
his
fate
if
any
offences
committed
by
man
can
deserve
so
horrible
a
the
present
lord
suffield
is
that
edward
harbord
whose
left
him
to
buy
a
seat
in
parliament
and
who
refused
to
carry
an
address
to
the
late
beloved
and
lamented
queen
because
major
cartwright
and
myself
were
chosen
to
accompany
him
never
mind
my
lord
you
will
grow
less
fastidious
they
say
however
that
he
is
really
good
to
his
tenants
and
has
told
them
that
he
will
take
anything
that
they
can
give
there
is
some
sense
in
this
he
is
a
great
bible
man
and
it
is
strange
that
he
can
not
see
that
things
are
out
of
order
when
interference
in
this
way
can
be
at
all
while
there
is
a
church
that
receives
a
tenth
part
of
the
produce
of
the
there
are
some
oak
woods
here
but
very
poor
not
like
those
not
near
like
the
worst
of
those
in
hampshire
and
herefordshire
all
this
eastern
coast
seems
very
unpropitious
to
trees
of
all
we
passed
through
the
estate
of
a
marsin
whose
house
is
near
the
road
a
very
poor
spot
and
the
first
really
poor
ground
i
have
seen
in
norfolk
a
nasty
spewy
black
gravel
on
the
top
of
a
sour
clay
it
is
worse
than
the
heaths
between
godalming
and
liphook
for
while
it
is
too
poor
to
grow
anything
but
heath
it
is
too
cold
to
give
you
the
chirping
of
the
grasshopper
in
summer
however
marsin
has
been
too
wise
to
enclose
this
wretched
land
which
is
just
like
that
which
lord
caernarvon
has
enclosed
in
the
parishes
of
highclere
and
burghclere
and
which
for
tillage
really
is
not
worth
a
single
farthing
an
holt
is
a
little
the
land
just
about
it
or
at
least
towards
the
east
is
poor
and
has
been
lately
enclosed
went
to
see
the
estate
of
hardy
at
leveringsett
a
hamlet
about
two
miles
from
holt
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
have
seen
a
in
this
part
of
england
from
holt
you
look
to
the
distance
of
seven
or
eight
miles
over
a
very
fine
valley
leaving
a
great
deal
of
inferior
hill
and
dell
within
its
boundaries
at
the
bottom
of
this
general
valley
hardy
has
a
very
beautiful
estate
of
about
four
hundred
acres
his
house
is
at
one
end
of
it
near
the
high
road
where
he
has
a
and
a
brewery
the
neat
and
ingenious
manner
of
managing
which
i
would
detail
if
my
total
unacquaintance
with
machinery
did
not
disqualify
me
for
the
task
his
estate
forms
a
valley
of
itself
somewhat
longer
than
broad
the
tops
and
the
sides
of
the
tops
of
the
hills
round
it
and
also
several
little
hillocks
in
the
valley
itself
are
judiciously
planted
with
trees
of
various
sorts
leaving
good
wide
roads
so
that
it
is
easy
to
ride
round
them
in
a
carriage
the
fields
the
fences
the
yards
and
stacks
the
buildings
the
cattle
all
showed
the
greatest
judgment
and
industry
there
was
really
nothing
that
the
most
critical
observer
could
say
was
of
however
the
forest
trees
do
not
grow
well
here
the
oaks
are
mere
scrubs
as
they
are
about
brentwood
in
essex
and
in
some
parts
of
cornwall
and
for
some
unaccountable
reason
people
seldom
plant
the
which
no
wind
will
as
it
does
the
oak
spent
the
evening
amongst
the
farmers
at
their
market
room
at
holt
and
very
much
pleased
at
them
i
was
we
talked
over
the
of
the
low
and
i
as
i
have
done
everywhere
endeavoured
to
convince
them
that
prices
must
fall
a
great
deal
lower
yet
and
that
no
man
who
wishes
not
to
be
ruined
ought
to
keep
or
take
a
farm
unless
on
a
calculation
of
best
wheat
at
a
bushel
and
a
best
southdown
ewe
at
or
even
they
heard
me
patiently
and
i
believe
were
well
convinced
of
the
truth
of
what
i
said
i
told
them
of
the
correctness
of
the
predictions
of
their
great
countryman
paine
and
observed
how
much
better
it
would
have
been
to
take
his
advice
than
to
burn
him
in
effigy
i
endeavoured
but
in
such
a
case
all
human
powers
must
fail
to
describe
to
them
the
sort
and
size
of
the
talents
of
the
man
of
the
great
of
the
jester
of
the
oxford
scholar
of
the
who
had
just
made
an
enormous
grasp
of
the
oracle
and
so
on
here
as
everywhere
else
i
hear
every
creature
speak
loudly
in
praise
of
it
is
well
known
to
my
readers
that
i
think
nothing
of
him
as
a
man
that
i
think
even
his
good
qualities
an
injury
to
his
country
because
they
serve
the
knaves
whom
he
is
duped
by
to
dupe
the
people
more
effectually
but
it
would
be
base
in
me
not
to
say
that
i
hear
from
men
of
all
parties
and
sensible
men
too
expressions
made
use
of
towards
him
that
affectionate
children
use
towards
the
best
of
parents
i
have
not
met
with
a
single
exception
apton
sunday
came
from
holt
through
saxthorpe
and
cawston
at
the
former
village
were
on
one
end
of
a
decent
white
house
these
words
caroline
for
her
britons
and
a
crown
over
all
in
black
i
need
not
have
looked
to
see
i
might
have
been
sure
that
the
owner
of
the
house
was
a
a
trade
which
numbers
more
men
of
sense
and
of
public
spirit
than
any
other
in
the
at
cawston
we
stopped
at
a
public
house
the
keeper
of
which
had
taken
and
read
the
register
for
years
i
shall
not
attempt
to
describe
the
pleasure
i
felt
at
the
hearty
welcome
given
us
by
pern
and
his
wife
and
by
a
young
miller
of
the
village
who
having
learnt
at
holt
that
we
were
to
return
that
way
had
come
to
meet
us
the
house
being
on
the
side
of
the
great
road
from
which
the
village
is
at
some
distance
this
is
the
of
the
famous
all
the
history
of
whom
we
now
learned
and
if
we
could
have
gone
to
the
village
they
were
prepared
to
the
and
show
us
the
old
woman
who
nursed
the
these
norfolk
never
do
things
by
halves
we
came
away
very
much
pleased
with
our
reception
at
cawston
and
with
a
promise
on
my
part
that
if
i
visited
the
county
again
i
would
write
a
register
there
a
promise
which
i
shall
certainly
keep
yarmouth
friday
morning
the
day
before
yesterday
i
set
out
for
bergh
apton
with
clarke
to
come
hither
by
the
way
of
in
suffolk
we
stopped
at
charles
clarke
at
beccles
where
we
saw
some
good
and
sensible
men
who
see
clearly
into
all
the
parts
of
the
works
of
the
thunderers
and
whose
anticipations
as
to
the
general
working
of
events
are
such
as
they
ought
to
be
they
gave
us
a
humorous
account
of
the
rabble
having
recently
crowned
a
jackass
and
of
a
struggle
between
them
and
the
yeomanry
cavaltry
this
a
place
of
most
ardent
and
blazing
as
the
pretenders
to
it
call
it
but
it
seems
it
now
blazes
less
furiously
it
is
milder
more
measured
in
its
effusions
and
with
the
help
of
low
prices
will
become
bearable
in
time
this
beccles
is
a
very
pretty
place
has
watered
meadows
near
it
and
is
situated
amidst
fine
lands
what
a
it
must
be
to
make
people
wretched
in
a
country
like
this
could
he
be
that
invented
such
a
system
gaffer
gooch
father
a
very
old
man
lives
not
far
from
here
we
had
a
good
deal
of
fun
about
the
gaffer
who
will
certainly
never
lose
the
name
unless
he
should
be
made
a
we
slept
at
the
house
of
a
friend
of
clarke
on
our
way
and
got
to
this
very
fine
town
of
great
yarmouth
yesterday
about
noon
a
party
of
friends
met
us
and
conducted
us
about
the
town
which
is
a
very
beautiful
one
indeed
what
i
liked
best
however
was
the
hearty
welcome
that
i
met
with
because
it
showed
that
the
reign
of
calumny
and
delusion
was
passed
a
company
of
gentlemen
gave
me
a
dinner
in
the
evening
and
in
all
my
life
i
never
saw
a
set
of
men
more
worthy
of
my
respect
and
gratitude
sensible
modest
understanding
the
whole
of
our
case
and
clearly
foreseeing
what
is
about
to
happen
one
gentleman
proposed
that
as
it
would
be
impossible
for
all
to
go
to
london
there
should
be
a
feast
of
the
a
plan
which
i
hope
will
be
adopted
i
leave
great
yarmouth
with
sentiments
of
the
sincerest
regard
for
all
those
whom
i
there
saw
and
conversed
with
and
with
my
best
wishes
for
the
happiness
of
all
its
inhabitants
nay
even
the
not
excepted
for
if
they
did
not
come
to
welcome
me
they
collected
in
a
group
to
me
and
that
was
one
step
towards
doing
justice
to
him
whom
their
order
have
so
much
so
foully
and
if
they
knew
their
own
interest
so
foolishly
slandered
apton
night
after
returning
from
yarmouth
yesterday
went
to
dine
at
about
six
miles
off
got
home
at
and
came
to
norwich
this
morning
this
being
and
also
the
day
fixed
on
for
a
radical
reform
dinner
at
the
swan
inn
to
which
i
was
invited
norwich
is
a
very
fine
city
and
the
castle
which
stands
in
the
middle
of
it
on
a
hill
is
truly
majestic
the
meat
and
poultry
and
vegetable
market
is
beautiful
it
is
kept
in
a
large
open
square
in
the
middle
or
nearly
so
of
the
city
the
ground
is
a
pretty
sharp
slope
so
that
you
see
all
at
once
it
resembles
one
of
the
french
markets
only
the
vendors
are
all
standing
and
gabbling
like
parrots
and
the
meat
is
lean
and
bloody
and
nasty
and
the
people
snuffy
and
grimy
in
hands
and
face
the
contrary
precisely
the
contrary
of
all
which
is
the
case
in
this
beautiful
market
at
norwich
where
the
women
have
a
sort
of
uniform
brown
great
coats
with
white
aprons
and
i
think
they
call
them
going
from
the
apron
up
to
the
bosom
they
equal
in
neatness
for
nothing
can
surpass
the
market
women
in
the
is
held
on
the
hill
by
the
castle
and
many
are
smaller
in
bulk
of
stock
the
is
held
in
a
very
magnificent
place
called
saint
andrew
hall
which
will
contain
two
or
three
thousand
persons
they
tell
me
that
this
used
to
be
a
most
delightful
scene
a
most
joyous
one
and
i
think
it
was
this
scene
that
curwen
described
in
such
glowing
colours
when
he
was
talking
of
the
norfolk
farmers
each
worth
so
many
thousands
of
pounds
bear
me
witness
reader
that
never
was
by
such
sights
that
the
false
glare
never
put
my
eyes
out
and
that
even
then
twelve
years
ago
i
warned
curwen
of
the
bear
witness
to
this
my
disciples
and
justify
the
doctrines
of
him
for
whose
sakes
you
have
endured
persecution
how
different
would
curwen
find
the
scene
what
took
place
at
the
dinner
has
been
already
recorded
in
the
register
and
i
have
only
to
add
with
regard
to
it
that
my
reception
at
norfolk
was
such
that
i
have
only
to
regret
the
total
want
of
power
to
make
those
hearty
norfolk
and
norwich
friends
any
suitable
return
whether
by
act
or
word
monday
went
from
bergh
apton
to
norwich
in
the
morning
and
from
norwich
to
london
during
the
day
carrying
with
me
great
admiration
of
and
respect
for
this
county
of
and
hearty
open
and
spirited
men
the
norfolk
people
are
quick
and
smart
in
their
motions
and
in
their
speaking
very
neat
and
in
all
their
farming
concerns
and
very
skilful
their
land
is
good
their
roads
are
level
and
the
bottom
of
their
soil
is
dry
to
be
sure
and
these
are
great
advantages
but
they
are
diligent
and
make
the
most
of
everything
their
management
of
all
sorts
of
stock
is
most
judicious
they
are
careful
about
manure
their
teams
move
quickly
and
in
short
it
is
a
county
of
most
excellent
the
churches
in
norfolk
are
generally
large
and
the
towers
lofty
they
have
all
been
well
built
at
first
many
of
them
are
of
the
saxon
architecture
they
are
almost
all
i
do
not
remember
an
exception
placed
on
the
spots
to
be
found
near
where
they
stand
and
it
is
curious
enough
that
the
contrary
practice
should
have
prevailed
in
countries
where
they
are
generally
found
in
valleys
and
in
low
sheltered
dells
even
in
those
valleys
these
churches
prove
that
the
people
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
were
always
a
superior
people
in
point
of
wealth
while
the
size
of
them
proves
that
the
country
parts
were
at
one
time
a
great
deal
more
populous
than
they
now
are
the
great
drawbacks
on
the
beauty
of
these
counties
are
their
flatness
and
their
want
of
fine
woods
but
to
those
who
can
dispense
with
these
norfolk
under
a
wise
and
just
government
can
have
nothing
to
ask
more
than
providence
and
the
industry
of
man
have
given
landlord
distress
meetings
for
in
fact
it
is
not
the
but
the
and
who
wants
relief
from
the
the
tenant
remedy
is
quitting
his
farm
or
bringing
down
his
rent
to
what
he
can
afford
to
give
wheat
being
or
shillings
a
bushel
this
is
his
remedy
what
should
want
high
prices
for
they
can
do
no
good
and
this
i
proved
to
the
farmers
last
year
the
fact
is
the
landlords
and
parsons
are
urging
the
farmers
on
to
get
to
give
them
high
rents
and
high
tithes
at
there
has
been
a
meeting
at
which
sense
was
discovered
at
any
rate
the
parties
talked
about
the
the
the
and
so
on
and
seemed
to
be
in
a
very
warm
temper
pray
keep
yourselves
gentlemen
for
you
have
a
great
deal
to
endure
yet
i
deeply
regret
that
i
have
not
room
to
insert
the
resolutions
of
this
meeting
there
is
to
be
a
meeting
at
east
sussex
on
the
instant
at
which
mean
to
i
want
to
my
friends
on
the
to
see
how
they
now
at
a
public
dinner
given
to
cobbett
at
norwich
on
the
above
mentioned
the
company
drank
the
toast
of
cobbett
and
his
trash
the
name
trash
having
being
at
one
time
applied
by
lord
castlereagh
to
the
in
acknowledging
this
toast
cobbett
addressed
the
company
in
a
speech
of
which
the
following
is
a
passage
my
thanks
to
you
for
having
drunk
my
health
are
great
and
sincere
but
much
greater
pleasure
do
i
feel
at
the
approbation
bestowed
on
that
which
has
for
so
many
years
been
a
mark
for
the
finger
of
scorn
to
be
pointed
at
by
ignorant
selfishness
and
arrogant
and
insolent
power
to
enumerate
barely
to
name
all
or
a
hundredth
part
of
the
endeavours
that
have
been
made
to
stifle
this
would
require
a
much
longer
space
of
time
than
that
which
we
have
now
before
us
but
gentlemen
those
endeavours
must
have
money
must
have
been
expended
in
the
circulation
of
and
the
endless
bale
of
papers
and
pamphlets
put
forth
to
check
the
progress
of
the
and
when
we
take
into
view
the
immense
sums
expended
in
keeping
down
the
spirit
excited
by
the
who
of
us
is
to
tell
whether
these
endeavours
taken
altogether
may
not
have
added
to
that
debt
of
which
without
any
hint
at
a
some
men
have
now
the
audacity
the
unprincipled
the
profligate
assurance
to
talk
of
reducing
the
interest
the
trash
gentlemen
is
now
triumphant
its
triumph
we
are
now
met
to
celebrate
proofs
of
its
triumph
i
myself
witnessed
not
many
hours
ago
in
that
scene
where
the
best
possible
evidence
was
to
be
found
in
walking
through
andrew
hall
my
mind
was
not
so
much
engaged
on
the
grandeur
of
the
place
or
on
the
gratifying
reception
i
met
with
those
hearty
shakes
by
the
hand
which
i
so
much
like
those
smiles
of
approbation
which
not
to
see
with
pride
would
argue
an
insensibility
to
honest
fame
even
these
i
do
sincerely
assure
you
engaged
my
mind
much
less
than
the
melancholy
reflection
that
of
the
two
thousand
or
fifteen
hundred
farmers
then
in
my
view
there
were
probably
who
came
to
the
hall
with
aching
hearts
and
who
would
leave
it
in
a
state
of
mental
agony
what
a
thing
to
contemplate
gentlemen
what
a
scene
is
here
a
set
of
men
occupiers
of
the
land
producers
of
all
that
we
eat
drink
wear
and
of
all
that
forms
the
buildings
that
shelter
us
a
set
of
men
industrious
and
careful
by
habit
cool
thoughtful
and
sensible
from
the
instructions
of
nature
a
set
of
men
provident
above
all
others
and
engaged
in
pursuits
in
their
nature
stable
as
the
very
earth
they
till
to
see
a
set
of
men
like
this
plunged
into
anxiety
embarrassment
jeopardy
not
to
be
described
and
when
the
particular
individuals
before
me
were
famed
for
their
superior
skill
in
this
great
and
solid
pursuit
and
were
blessed
with
soil
and
other
circumstances
to
make
them
prosperous
and
happy
to
behold
this
sight
would
have
been
more
than
sufficient
to
sink
my
heart
within
me
had
i
not
been
upheld
by
the
reflection
that
i
had
done
all
in
my
power
to
prevent
these
calamities
and
that
i
still
had
in
reserve
that
which
with
the
assistance
of
the
sufferers
themselves
would
restore
them
and
the
nation
to
happiness
sussex
journal
to
battle
through
bromley
and
tunbridge
wednesday
came
here
from
kensington
in
order
to
see
what
goes
on
at
the
meeting
to
be
held
here
of
the
gentry
clergy
freeholders
and
occupiers
of
land
in
the
rape
of
hastings
to
take
into
consideration
the
distressed
state
of
the
agricultural
interest
i
shall
of
course
give
an
account
of
this
meeting
after
it
has
taken
you
come
through
part
of
to
get
to
from
the
great
on
the
surrey
side
of
the
thames
the
first
town
is
bromley
the
next
the
next
tunbridge
and
between
tunbridge
and
this
place
you
cross
the
boundaries
of
the
two
from
the
surrey
wen
to
bromley
the
land
is
generally
a
deep
loam
on
a
gravel
and
you
see
few
trees
except
elm
a
very
ugly
country
on
quitting
bromley
the
land
gets
poorer
clay
at
bottom
the
wheat
sown
on
five
or
seven
turn
lands
the
furrows
shining
with
wet
rushes
on
the
wastes
on
the
sides
of
the
road
here
there
is
a
common
part
of
which
has
been
enclosed
and
thrown
out
again
or
rather
the
fences
carried
there
is
a
frost
this
morning
some
ice
and
the
women
look
there
is
a
very
great
variety
of
soil
along
this
road
bottom
of
yellow
clay
then
of
sand
then
of
then
of
solider
stone
then
for
about
five
miles
of
chalk
then
of
red
clay
then
chalk
again
here
before
you
come
to
is
a
most
beautiful
and
rich
valley
extending
from
east
to
west
with
rich
and
fine
trees
then
comes
again
and
the
near
which
is
a
pretty
little
town
with
beautiful
environs
part
of
which
consists
of
the
park
of
the
seat
of
the
duchess
of
dorset
it
is
a
very
fine
place
and
there
is
another
park
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
so
that
this
is
a
delightful
place
and
the
land
appears
to
be
very
good
the
gardens
and
houses
all
look
neat
and
nice
on
quitting
you
come
to
a
bottom
of
gravel
for
a
short
distance
and
to
a
clay
for
many
miles
when
i
say
that
i
saw
teams
gravel
from
this
spot
to
a
distance
of
nearly
along
the
road
the
reader
will
be
at
no
loss
to
know
what
sort
of
bottom
the
land
has
all
along
here
the
bottom
then
becomes
again
this
vein
of
land
runs
all
along
through
the
county
of
sussex
and
the
clay
runs
into
hampshire
across
the
forests
of
bere
and
waltham
then
across
the
parishes
of
ouslebury
stoke
and
passing
between
the
sand
hills
of
southampton
and
chalk
hills
of
winchester
goes
westward
till
stopped
by
the
chalky
downs
between
romsey
and
tunbridge
is
a
small
but
very
nice
town
and
has
some
fine
meadows
and
a
navigable
the
rest
of
the
way
to
battle
presents
alternately
clay
and
of
course
the
coppices
and
oak
woods
are
very
frequent
there
is
now
and
then
a
spot
and
now
and
then
an
orchard
of
apples
or
cherries
but
these
are
poor
indeed
compared
with
what
you
see
about
canterbury
and
maidstone
the
agricultural
state
of
the
country
or
rather
the
quality
of
the
land
from
bromley
to
battle
may
be
judged
of
from
the
fact
that
i
did
not
see
as
i
came
along
more
than
thirty
acres
of
swedes
during
the
miles
in
norfolk
i
should
in
the
same
distance
have
seen
five
hundred
acres
however
man
was
not
the
maker
of
the
land
and
as
to
human
happiness
i
am
of
opinion
that
as
much
and
even
more
falls
to
the
lot
of
the
chaps
that
live
in
and
rove
about
amongst
those
clays
and
woods
as
to
the
more
regularly
disciplined
labourers
of
the
rich
and
prime
parts
of
england
as
god
has
made
the
back
to
the
burthen
so
the
clay
and
coppice
people
make
the
dress
to
the
stubs
and
bushes
under
the
sole
of
the
shoe
is
from
the
sole
six
inches
upwards
is
a
then
comes
a
leather
bam
to
the
knee
then
comes
a
pair
of
leather
breeches
then
comes
a
stout
doublet
over
this
comes
a
and
the
wearer
sets
brush
and
stubs
and
thorns
and
mire
at
defiance
i
have
always
observed
that
woodland
and
forest
labourers
are
best
off
in
the
main
the
coppices
give
them
pleasant
and
profitable
work
in
winter
if
they
have
not
so
great
a
they
have
a
three
weeks
harvest
in
april
or
may
that
is
to
say
in
the
season
of
barking
which
in
hampshire
is
called
and
in
sussex
which
employs
women
and
children
as
well
as
men
and
then
in
the
great
article
of
they
none
it
is
miserable
work
where
this
is
to
be
bought
and
where
as
at
salisbury
the
poor
take
by
turns
the
making
of
fires
at
their
houses
to
boil
four
or
five
what
a
must
those
lead
whose
turn
it
is
not
to
make
the
fire
at
launceston
in
cornwall
a
man
a
tradesman
too
told
me
that
the
people
in
general
could
not
afford
to
have
fire
in
ordinary
and
that
he
himself
paid
for
boiling
a
leg
of
mutton
at
another
man
fire
the
know
none
of
these
miseries
at
any
rate
they
literally
get
their
fuel
by
or
by
whence
doubtless
comes
that
old
and
very
expressive
saying
which
is
applied
to
those
cases
where
people
have
a
by
one
means
or
another
thursday
night
there
has
been
a
here
of
the
landlords
and
farmers
in
this
part
of
sussex
which
is
called
the
of
the
object
was
to
agree
on
a
petition
to
parliament
praying
for
good
god
where
is
this
to
we
now
see
the
effects
of
those
which
i
have
been
railing
against
for
the
last
twenty
years
here
were
collected
together
not
less
than
persons
principally
landlords
and
farmers
brought
from
their
homes
by
their
distresses
and
by
their
alarms
for
the
future
never
were
such
things
heard
in
any
country
before
and
it
is
useless
to
hope
for
terrific
must
be
the
consequences
if
an
effectual
remedy
be
not
speedily
applied
the
town
which
is
small
was
in
a
great
bustle
before
noon
and
the
meeting
in
a
large
room
in
the
principal
inn
took
place
about
one
lord
ashburnham
was
called
to
the
chair
and
there
were
present
curteis
one
of
the
county
members
fuller
who
formerly
used
to
cut
a
in
the
house
of
commons
lambe
and
many
other
gentlemen
of
landed
property
within
the
rape
or
district
for
which
the
meeting
was
held
curteis
after
lord
ashburnham
had
opened
the
business
addressed
the
meeting
fuller
then
tendered
some
resolutions
describing
the
fallen
state
of
the
landed
interest
and
proposing
to
pray
for
relief
britton
complained
that
it
was
not
proposed
to
pray
for
some
and
insisted
that
the
cause
of
the
evil
was
the
rise
in
the
value
of
money
without
a
corresponding
reduction
in
the
a
committee
was
appointed
to
draw
up
a
petition
which
was
next
produced
it
merely
described
the
distress
and
prayed
generally
for
relief
holloway
proposed
an
addition
containing
an
imputation
of
the
distress
to
restricted
currency
and
unabated
taxation
and
praying
for
a
reduction
of
taxes
a
discussion
now
arose
upon
two
points
first
whether
the
addition
were
admissible
at
all
and
second
whether
holloway
was
qualified
to
offer
it
to
the
meeting
both
the
points
having
been
at
last
decided
in
the
affirmative
the
addition
or
amendment
was
put
and
and
then
the
original
petition
was
adopted
after
the
business
of
the
day
was
ended
there
was
a
dinner
in
the
inn
in
the
same
room
where
the
meeting
had
been
held
i
was
at
this
dinner
and
britton
having
proposed
my
health
and
curteis
who
was
in
the
chair
having
given
it
i
thought
it
would
have
looked
like
which
is
in
fact
only
another
term
for
hypocrisy
to
refrain
from
expressing
my
opinions
upon
a
point
or
two
connected
with
the
business
of
the
day
i
shall
now
insert
a
substantially
correct
sketch
of
what
the
company
was
indulgent
enough
to
hear
from
me
at
the
dinner
which
i
take
from
the
report
contained
in
the
of
saturday
last
the
report
in
the
chronicle
has
all
the
of
what
i
advanced
relative
to
inutility
of
corn
and
relative
to
cause
of
further
declining
two
points
of
the
greatest
importance
in
themselves
and
which
i
was
and
am
uncommonly
anxious
to
press
upon
the
attention
of
the
public
the
following
is
a
part
of
the
speech
so
reported
i
am
decidedly
of
opinion
gentlemen
that
a
corn
bill
of
no
description
no
matter
what
its
principles
or
provisions
can
do
either
tenant
or
landlord
any
good
and
i
am
not
less
decidedly
of
opinion
that
though
prices
are
now
low
they
must
all
the
present
train
of
public
measures
continuing
be
yet
lower
and
continue
lower
upon
an
average
of
years
and
of
as
to
a
corn
bill
a
law
to
prohibit
or
check
the
importation
of
human
food
is
a
perfect
novelty
in
our
history
and
ought
therefore
independent
of
the
reason
and
the
recent
experience
of
the
case
to
be
received
and
entertained
with
great
suspicion
heretofore
have
been
given
for
the
exportation
and
at
other
times
for
the
importation
of
corn
but
of
laws
to
prevent
the
importation
of
human
food
our
ancestors
knew
nothing
and
what
says
recent
experience
when
the
present
corn
bill
was
passed
i
then
a
farmer
unable
to
get
my
brother
farmers
to
join
me
against
this
bill
and
i
stated
to
my
brother
farmers
that
such
a
bill
could
do
us
no
good
while
it
would
not
fail
to
excite
against
us
the
of
the
other
classes
of
the
community
a
thought
by
no
means
pleasant
thus
has
it
been
the
distress
of
agriculture
was
considerable
in
magnitude
then
but
what
is
it
now
and
yet
the
bill
was
passed
that
bill
which
was
to
remunerate
and
protect
is
still
in
force
the
farmers
got
what
they
prayed
to
have
granted
them
and
their
distress
with
a
short
interval
of
tardy
pace
has
proceeded
rapidly
increasing
from
that
day
to
this
what
in
the
way
of
corn
bill
can
you
have
gentlemen
beyond
absolute
prohibition
and
have
you
not
since
about
april
had
absolute
prohibition
since
that
time
no
corn
has
been
imported
and
then
only
thirty
millions
of
bushels
which
supposing
it
all
to
have
been
wheat
was
a
quantity
much
too
insignificant
to
produce
any
sensible
depression
in
the
price
of
the
immense
quantity
of
corn
raised
in
this
kingdom
since
the
last
bushel
was
imported
if
your
produce
had
fallen
in
this
manner
if
your
prices
had
come
down
very
low
immediately
after
the
importation
had
taken
place
there
might
have
been
some
colour
of
reason
to
impute
the
fall
to
the
importation
but
it
so
happens
and
as
if
for
the
express
purpose
of
contradicting
the
crude
notions
of
webb
hall
that
your
produce
has
fallen
in
price
at
a
greater
rate
in
proportion
as
time
has
removed
you
from
the
point
of
importation
and
as
to
the
circumstance
so
ostentatiously
put
forward
by
hall
and
others
that
there
is
still
some
of
the
imported
corn
what
does
it
prove
but
the
converse
of
what
those
gentlemen
aim
at
that
is
to
say
that
the
holders
to
sell
it
at
present
prices
for
if
they
could
gain
but
ever
so
little
by
the
sale
would
they
keep
it
wasting
and
costing
money
in
warehouse
there
appears
with
some
persons
to
be
a
notion
that
the
importation
of
corn
is
a
they
seem
to
forget
that
during
the
last
war
when
agriculture
was
so
the
were
always
that
prodigious
quantities
of
corn
were
imported
during
the
war
that
so
far
from
importation
being
prohibited
high
were
given
paid
out
of
the
taxes
partly
raised
upon
english
farmers
to
induce
men
to
import
corn
all
this
seems
to
be
forgotten
as
much
as
if
it
had
never
taken
place
and
now
the
distress
of
the
english
farmer
is
imputed
to
a
cause
which
was
never
before
an
object
of
his
attention
and
a
desire
is
expressed
to
put
an
end
to
a
branch
of
commerce
which
the
nation
has
always
freely
carried
on
i
think
gentlemen
that
here
are
reasons
quite
sufficient
to
make
any
man
but
webb
hall
slow
to
impute
the
present
distress
to
the
importation
of
corn
but
at
any
rate
what
can
you
have
beyond
absolute
efficient
prohibition
no
law
no
duty
however
high
nothing
that
the
parliament
can
do
can
go
beyond
this
and
this
you
now
have
in
effect
as
completely
as
if
this
were
the
only
country
beneath
the
sky
for
these
reasons
gentlemen
and
to
state
more
would
be
a
waste
of
your
time
and
an
affront
to
your
understandings
i
am
convinced
that
in
the
way
of
corn
bill
it
is
impossible
for
the
parliament
to
afford
you
any
even
the
smallest
portion
of
relief
as
to
the
other
point
gentlemen
the
tendency
which
the
present
measures
and
course
of
things
have
to
carry
prices
and
considerably
lower
than
they
now
are
and
to
keep
them
for
a
permanency
at
that
low
rate
this
is
a
matter
worthy
of
the
serious
attention
of
all
connected
with
the
land
and
particularly
of
that
of
the
renting
farmer
during
the
no
importations
distressed
the
farmer
it
was
not
till
peace
came
that
the
cry
of
distress
was
heard
but
during
the
war
there
was
a
boundless
issue
of
paper
money
those
issues
were
instantly
narrowed
by
the
peace
the
law
being
that
the
bank
should
pay
in
cash
six
months
after
the
peace
should
take
place
this
was
the
cause
of
that
distress
which
led
to
the
present
corn
bill
the
disease
occasioned
by
the
preparations
for
has
been
brought
to
a
crisis
by
peel
bill
which
has
in
effect
doubled
if
not
tripled
the
real
amount
of
the
taxes
and
violated
all
contracts
for
time
given
triple
gains
to
every
lender
and
placed
every
borrower
in
jeopardy
friday
got
home
from
i
had
no
time
to
see
the
town
having
entered
the
inn
on
wednesday
in
the
dusk
of
the
evening
having
been
engaged
all
day
yesterday
in
the
inn
and
having
come
out
of
it
only
to
get
into
the
coach
this
morning
i
had
not
time
to
go
even
to
see
the
seat
of
the
webster
family
now
occupied
by
a
man
of
the
name
of
thus
they
it
will
take
a
much
shorter
time
than
most
people
imagine
to
put
out
all
the
ancient
families
i
should
think
that
six
years
will
turn
out
all
those
who
receive
nothing
out
of
taxes
the
greatness
of
the
estate
is
no
protection
to
the
owner
for
great
or
little
it
will
soon
yield
him
rents
and
when
the
produce
is
nothing
in
either
case
the
small
estate
is
as
good
as
the
large
one
curteis
said
that
the
was
yes
but
the
are
and
if
freeholds
can
not
be
seized
for
common
contract
debts
the
carcass
of
the
owner
may
but
in
fact
there
will
be
no
rents
and
without
these
the
ownership
is
an
empty
sound
thus
at
last
the
burthen
will
as
i
always
said
it
would
fall
upon
the
and
as
the
fault
of
supporting
the
system
has
been
wholly
his
the
burthen
will
fall
upon
the
whether
he
will
now
call
in
the
people
to
help
him
to
shake
it
off
is
more
than
i
can
say
but
if
he
do
not
i
am
sure
that
he
must
sink
under
it
and
then
will
no
have
been
accomplished
but
far
and
very
far
indeed
will
that
be
from
being
the
of
the
drama
i
can
not
quit
battle
without
observing
that
the
country
is
very
pretty
all
about
it
all
hill
or
valley
a
great
deal
of
in
which
the
underwood
is
generally
very
fine
though
the
oaks
are
not
very
fine
and
a
good
deal
covered
with
this
shows
that
the
clay
ends
before
the
of
the
oak
gets
as
deep
as
it
would
go
for
when
the
clay
goes
the
full
depth
the
oaks
are
always
the
woods
are
too
large
and
too
near
each
other
for
and
as
to
coursing
it
is
out
of
the
question
here
but
it
is
a
fine
country
for
shooting
and
for
harbouring
game
of
all
it
was
rainy
as
i
came
home
but
the
woodmen
were
at
work
a
great
many
are
cut
here
which
makes
the
coppices
more
valuable
than
in
many
other
parts
the
women
work
in
the
coppices
shaving
the
bark
of
the
and
indeed
at
various
other
parts
of
the
business
these
poles
are
shaved
to
prevent
from
breeding
in
the
bark
and
accelerating
the
destruction
of
the
pole
it
is
curious
that
the
bark
of
trees
should
generate
maggots
but
it
has
as
well
as
the
wood
a
matter
in
it
the
hickory
wood
in
america
sends
out
from
the
ends
of
the
logs
when
these
are
burning
great
quantities
of
the
finest
syrup
that
can
be
imagined
accordingly
that
wood
breeds
maggots
or
worms
as
they
are
usually
called
surprisingly
our
breeds
worms
very
much
when
the
tree
or
pole
is
cut
the
moist
matter
between
the
outer
bark
and
the
wood
putrifies
thence
come
the
maggots
which
soon
begin
to
eat
their
way
into
the
wood
for
this
reason
the
bark
is
shaved
off
the
as
it
ought
to
be
off
all
our
timber
trees
as
soon
as
cut
especially
the
little
boys
and
girls
shave
and
assist
in
other
coppice
work
very
nicely
and
it
is
pleasant
work
when
the
weather
is
dry
overhead
the
woods
bedded
with
leaves
as
they
are
are
clean
and
dry
underfoot
they
are
warm
too
even
in
the
coldest
weather
when
the
ground
is
frozen
several
inches
deep
in
the
open
fields
it
is
scarcely
frozen
at
all
in
a
coppice
where
the
underwood
is
a
good
plant
and
where
it
is
nearly
high
enough
to
cut
so
that
the
woodman
is
really
a
pleasant
life
we
are
apt
to
think
that
the
birds
have
a
hard
time
of
it
in
winter
but
we
forget
the
warmth
of
the
woods
which
far
exceeds
anything
to
be
found
in
farm
yards
when
sidmouth
started
me
from
my
farm
in
i
had
just
planted
my
farm
yard
round
with
a
pretty
coppice
but
never
mind
sidmouth
and
i
shall
i
dare
say
have
plenty
of
time
and
occasion
to
talk
about
that
coppice
and
many
other
things
before
we
die
and
can
i
when
i
think
of
these
things
now
those
to
whom
sidmouth
his
of
starting
me
but
let
me
forget
the
subject
for
this
time
at
any
woodland
countries
are
interesting
on
many
accounts
not
so
much
on
account
of
their
masses
of
green
leaves
as
on
account
of
the
variety
of
sights
and
sounds
and
incidents
that
they
afford
even
in
winter
the
coppices
are
beautiful
to
the
eye
while
they
comfort
the
mind
with
the
idea
of
shelter
and
warmth
in
spring
they
change
their
hue
from
day
to
day
during
two
whole
months
which
is
about
the
time
from
the
first
appearance
of
the
delicate
leaves
of
the
birch
to
the
full
expansion
of
those
of
the
ash
and
even
before
the
leaves
come
at
all
to
intercept
the
view
what
in
the
vegetable
creation
is
so
delightful
to
behold
as
the
bed
of
a
coppice
bespangled
with
primroses
and
the
opening
of
the
birch
leaves
is
the
signal
for
the
pheasant
to
begin
to
crow
for
the
blackbird
to
whistle
and
the
thrush
to
sing
and
just
when
the
begin
to
look
reddish
and
not
a
day
before
the
whole
tribe
of
finches
burst
forth
in
songs
from
every
bough
while
the
lark
imitating
them
all
carries
the
joyous
sounds
to
the
sky
these
are
amongst
the
means
which
providence
has
benignantly
appointed
to
sweeten
the
toils
by
which
food
and
raiment
are
produced
these
the
english
ploughman
could
once
hear
without
the
sorrowful
reflection
that
he
himself
was
a
and
that
the
bounties
of
nature
had
for
him
been
scattered
in
vain
and
shall
he
never
see
an
end
to
this
state
of
things
shall
he
never
have
the
due
reward
of
his
labour
shall
unsparing
taxation
never
cease
to
make
him
a
miserable
dejected
being
a
creature
famishing
in
the
midst
of
abundance
fainting
expiring
with
hunger
feeble
moans
surrounded
by
a
carolling
creation
o
accursed
has
hell
a
torment
surpassing
the
wickedness
of
thy
inventor
sussex
journal
through
croydon
godstone
and
uckfield
to
lewes
and
brighton
returning
by
cuckfield
worth
and
tuesday
came
here
from
home
to
see
what
passes
at
a
meeting
to
be
held
here
of
the
owners
and
occupiers
of
land
in
the
rapes
of
lewes
and
in
quitting
the
great
wen
we
go
through
surrey
more
than
half
the
way
to
lewes
from
saint
which
now
are
covered
with
houses
we
go
towards
croydon
between
rows
of
houses
nearly
half
the
way
and
the
whole
way
is
nine
miles
there
are
erected
within
these
four
years
two
entire
miles
of
houses
on
this
one
road
and
the
work
goes
on
with
accelerated
force
to
be
sure
for
the
taxes
being
in
fact
tripled
by
peel
bill
the
fundlords
increase
in
riches
and
their
accommodations
increase
of
course
what
an
at
once
horrible
and
ridiculous
thing
this
country
would
become
if
this
thing
could
go
on
only
for
a
few
years
and
these
rows
of
new
houses
added
to
the
wen
are
proofs
of
growing
prosperity
are
they
these
make
part
of
the
increased
capital
of
the
country
do
they
but
how
is
this
wen
to
be
i
know
not
whether
it
be
to
be
done
by
knife
or
by
caustic
but
dispersed
it
must
be
and
this
is
the
only
difficulty
which
i
do
not
see
the
means
of
getting
aye
these
are
dreadful
thoughts
i
know
they
are
but
they
ought
not
to
be
banished
from
the
mind
for
they
will
and
at
every
return
they
will
be
more
frightful
the
man
who
can
not
coolly
look
at
this
matter
is
unfit
for
the
times
that
are
approaching
let
the
interest
of
the
debt
be
once
well
reduced
and
that
must
be
sooner
or
later
and
then
what
is
to
become
of
a
at
least
of
the
people
congregated
in
this
wen
oh
precious
great
man
now
no
more
oh
pilot
that
weathered
the
storm
oh
pupil
of

the
sands
of
the
sea
shall
number
the
execrations
with
which
thy
memory
will
be
loaded
from
london
to
croydon
is
as
ugly
a
bit
of
country
as
any
in
england
a
poor
spewy
gravel
with
some
clay
few
trees
but
elms
and
those
generally
stripped
up
and
villanously
croydon
is
a
good
but
is
by
the
funds
swelled
out
into
a
upon
quitting
croydon
for
godstone
you
come
to
the
chalk
hills
the
juniper
shrubs
and
the
yew
trees
this
is
an
extension
westward
of
the
vein
of
chalk
which
i
have
before
noticed
see
page
between
bromley
and
to
the
westward
here
lie
epsom
downs
which
lead
on
to
merrow
downs
and
margaret
hill
then
skipping
over
guildford
you
come
to
the
hog
back
which
is
still
of
chalk
and
at
the
west
end
of
which
lies
farnham
with
the
hog
back
this
vein
of
chalk
seems
to
end
for
then
the
valleys
become
rich
loam
and
the
hills
sand
and
gravel
till
you
approach
the
winchester
downs
by
the
way
of
godstone
which
is
in
surrey
also
is
a
beautiful
village
chiefly
of
one
street
with
a
fine
large
green
before
it
and
with
a
pond
in
the
green
a
little
way
to
the
right
going
from
london
lies
the
vile
rotten
borough
of
but
happily
for
godstone
out
of
sight
at
and
near
godstone
the
gardens
are
all
very
neat
and
at
the
inn
there
is
a
nice
garden
well
stocked
with
beautiful
flowers
in
the
season
i
here
saw
last
summer
some
double
violets
as
large
as
small
pinks
and
the
lady
of
the
house
was
kind
enough
to
give
me
some
of
the
from
godstone
you
go
up
a
long
hill
of
clay
and
sand
and
then
descend
into
a
level
country
of
stiff
loam
at
top
clay
at
bottom
pastures
broad
hedgerows
coppices
and
oak
woods
which
country
continues
till
you
quit
surrey
about
two
miles
before
you
reach
the
woods
and
coppices
are
very
fine
here
it
is
the
genuine
a
bottom
of
yellow
clay
to
any
depth
i
dare
say
that
man
can
go
no
moss
on
the
oaks
no
dead
tops
straight
as
larches
the
bark
of
the
young
trees
with
dark
spots
in
it
sure
sign
of
free
growth
and
great
depth
of
clay
beneath
the
wheat
is
here
sown
on
ridges
and
the
ploughing
is
amongst
the
best
that
i
ever
at
which
is
a
rotten
borough
and
a
very
shabby
place
you
come
to
stiff
loam
at
top
with
sand
stone
beneath
to
the
south
of
the
place
the
land
is
fine
and
the
vale
on
both
sides
a
very
beautiful
intermixture
of
woodland
and
and
at
about
three
miles
from
grinstead
you
come
to
a
pretty
village
called
and
then
on
the
road
to
uckfield
you
cross
ashurst
forest
which
is
a
heath
with
here
and
there
a
few
birch
scrubs
upon
it
verily
the
most
villanously
ugly
spot
i
ever
saw
in
england
this
lasts
you
for
five
miles
getting
if
possible
uglier
and
uglier
all
the
way
till
at
last
as
if
barren
soil
nasty
spewy
gravel
heath
and
even
that
stunted
were
not
enough
you
see
some
rising
spots
which
instead
of
trees
presents
you
with
black
ragged
hideous
rocks
there
may
be
englishmen
who
wish
to
see
the
coast
of
they
need
not
go
to
sea
for
here
it
is
to
the
life
if
i
had
been
in
a
long
trance
as
our
nobility
seem
to
have
been
and
had
been
waked
up
here
i
should
have
begun
to
look
about
for
the
indians
and
the
squaws
and
to
have
heaved
a
sigh
at
the
thought
of
being
so
far
from
from
the
end
of
this
forest
without
trees
you
come
into
a
country
of
but
poorish
wettish
land
passing
through
the
village
of
uckfield
you
find
an
enclosed
country
with
a
soil
of
a
clay
cast
all
the
way
to
within
about
three
miles
of
lewes
when
you
get
to
a
chalk
bottom
and
rich
land
i
was
at
lewes
at
the
beginning
of
last
harvest
and
saw
the
fine
farms
of
the
ellmans
very
justly
renowned
for
their
improvement
of
the
breed
of
and
the
younger
john
ellman
not
less
justly
blamed
for
the
part
he
had
taken
in
propagating
the
errors
of
webb
hall
and
thereby
however
unintentionally
assisting
to
lead
thousands
to
cherish
those
false
hopes
that
have
been
the
cause
of
their
ruin
ellman
may
say
that
he
he
was
right
but
if
he
had
read
my
year
to
the
farmers
published
in
the
preceding
january
he
could
not
think
that
he
was
right
if
he
had
not
read
it
he
ought
to
have
read
it
before
he
appeared
in
print
at
any
rate
if
no
other
person
had
a
right
to
censure
his
publications
i
that
right
i
will
here
notice
a
calumny
to
which
the
above
visit
to
lewes
gave
rise
namely
that
i
went
into
the
neighbourhood
of
the
ellmans
to
find
out
whether
they
their
labourers
no
man
that
knows
me
will
believe
this
the
facts
are
these
the
ellmans
celebrated
farmers
had
made
a
great
figure
in
the
evidence
taken
before
the
committee
i
was
at
worth
about
twenty
miles
from
lewes
the
harvest
was
begun
worth
is
a
woodland
country
i
wished
to
know
the
state
of
the
crops
for
i
was
at
that
very
time
as
will
be
seen
by
referring
to
the
date
beginning
to
write
my
first
letter
to
the
landlords
without
knowing
anything
of
the
matter
myself
i
asked
my
host
brazier
what
good
corn
country
was
nearest
to
us
he
said
lewes
off
i
went
and
he
with
me
in
a
we
had
miles
to
go
and
back
in
the
same
chaise
a
bad
road
and
rain
all
the
day
we
put
up
at
the
white
hart
took
another
chaise
went
round
and
saw
the
farms
through
the
window
of
the
chaise
having
stopped
at
a
little
to
ask
which
were
they
and
having
stopped
now
and
then
to
get
a
sample
out
of
the
sheaves
of
wheat
came
back
to
the
white
hart
after
being
absent
only
about
an
hour
and
a
half
got
our
dinner
and
got
back
to
worth
before
it
was
dark
and
never
asked
and
never
intended
to
ask
one
single
question
of
any
human
being
as
to
the
conduct
or
character
of
the
ellmans
indeed
the
evidence
of
the
elder
ellman
was
so
fair
so
honest
and
so
useful
particularly
as
relating
the
that
i
could
not
possibly
suspect
him
of
being
a
cruel
or
hard
master
he
told
the
committee
that
when
he
began
business
years
ago
every
man
in
the
parish
brewed
his
own
beer
and
that
now
not
one
man
did
it
unless
he
gave
him
the
malt
why
here
was
by
far
the
most
valuable
part
of
the
whole
volume
of
evidence
then
ellman
did
not
present
a
parcel
of
and
god
knows
what
but
a
plain
and
honest
statement
of
facts
the
rate
of
day
wages
of
job
wages
for
a
long
series
of
years
by
which
it
clearly
appeared
how
the
labourer
had
been
robbed
and
reduced
to
misery
and
how
the
had
been
increased
he
did
not
like
george
and
other
sink
these
interesting
facts
but
honestly
told
the
truth
therefore
whatever
i
might
think
of
his
endeavours
to
uphold
the
mischievous
errors
of
webb
hall
i
could
have
no
suspicion
that
he
was
a
hard
master
wednesday
the
meeting
and
the
dinner
are
now
over
davies
giddy
was
in
the
chair
the
place
the
county
hall
a
partington
a
pretty
little
oldish
smart
truss
nice
gentleman
with
a
yellow
and
red
handkerchief
round
his
neck
moved
the
petition
which
was
seconded
by
lord
chichester
who
lives
in
the
neighbourhood
much
as
i
had
read
of
that
great
doctor
of
and
commissioner
of
inimitable
bank
davies
giddy
i
had
never
seen
him
before
he
called
to
my
mind
one
of
those
venerable
persons
who
administer
spiritual
comfort
to
the
sinners
of
the
and
whether
i
looked
at
the
dress
or
the
person
i
could
almost
have
sworn
that
it
was
the
identical
that
i
saw
about
years
ago
at
philadelphia
in
the
farce
of
the
poor
soldier
blackman
of
lewes
i
believe
disapproved
of
the
petition
and
in
a
speech
of
considerable
length
and
also
of
considerable
ability
stated
to
the
meeting
that
the
evils
complained
of
arose
from
the
and
not
from
the
of
foreign
a
donavon
an
irish
gentleman
who
it
seems
is
a
magistrate
in
this
disturbed
county
disapproved
of
discussing
anything
at
such
a
meeting
and
thought
that
the
meeting
should
merely
state
its
distresses
and
leave
it
to
the
wisdom
of
parliament
to
discover
the
remedy
upon
which
chatfield
observed
so
sir
we
are
in
a
trap
we
can
not
get
ourselves
out
though
we
know
the
way
there
are
others
who
have
got
us
in
and
are
able
to
get
us
out
but
they
do
not
know
how
and
we
are
to
tell
them
it
seems
that
we
are
in
the
trap
but
are
not
to
tell
them
the
way
to
get
us
out
i
do
like
long
speeches
sir
but
i
like
common
sense
this
was
neat
and
pithy
fifty
professed
orators
could
not
in
a
whole
day
have
thrown
so
much
ridicule
on
the
speech
of
mr
a
mabbott
proposed
an
amendment
to
include
all
classes
of
the
community
and
took
a
hit
at
curteis
for
his
speech
at
battle
curteis
defended
himself
and
i
thought
very
fairly
a
woodward
who
said
he
was
a
farmer
carried
us
back
to
the
necessity
of
the
war
against
france
and
told
us
of
the
horrors
of
plunder
and
murder
and
rape
that
the
war
had
prevented
this
gentleman
put
an
end
to
my
patience
which
donavon
had
put
to
an
extremely
severe
test
and
so
i
after
i
went
away
blackman
proposed
some
resolutions
which
were
carried
by
a
great
majority
by
show
of
hands
but
pieces
of
paper
were
then
handed
about
for
the
voters
to
write
their
names
on
for
and
against
the
petition
the
greater
part
of
the
people
were
gone
away
by
this
time
but
at
any
rate
there
were
more
for
the
petition
than
for
the
resolutions
a
farmer
in
pennsylvania
having
a
visitor
to
whom
he
was
willing
to
show
how
well
he
treated
his
negroes
as
to
food
bid
the
fellows
who
were
at
dinner
ask
for
a
second
or
third
cut
of
pork
if
they
had
not
quite
surprised
at
the
novelty
but
emboldened
by
a
repetition
of
the
injunction
one
of
them
did
say
massa
i
wants
another
cut
he
had
it
but
as
soon
as
the
visitor
was
gone
away
d
n
you
says
the
master
while
he
belaboured
him
with
the
cowskin
make
you
know
to
understand
another
time
the
signers
of
this
petition
were
in
the
dark
while
the
show
of
hands
was
going
on
but
when
it
came
to
they
knew
well
massa
this
is
a
petition
to
be
sure
but
it
is
no
more
the
petition
of
the
farmers
in
the
rapes
of
lewes
and
pevensey
than
it
is
the
petition
of
the
mermaids
of
there
was
a
after
the
meeting
at
the
at
which
there
occurred
something
rather
curious
regarding
myself
when
at
battle
i
had
no
intention
of
going
to
lewes
till
on
the
evening
of
my
arrival
at
battle
a
gentleman
who
had
heard
of
the
calumny
observed
to
me
that
i
would
do
well
not
to
go
to
lewes
that
very
observation
made
me
resolve
to
go
i
went
as
a
spectator
to
the
meeting
and
i
left
no
one
ignorant
of
the
place
where
i
was
to
be
found
i
did
not
covet
the
noise
of
a
dinner
of
from
to
persons
and
i
did
not
intend
to
go
to
it
but
being
pressed
to
go
i
finally
went
after
some
previous
occurrences
kemp
formerly
a
member
for
lewes
was
called
to
the
chair
and
he
having
given
as
a
toast
speedy
discovery
of
a
remedy
for
our
ebenezer
johnstone
a
gentleman
of
lewes
whom
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
until
that
day
but
who
i
understand
is
a
very
opulent
and
most
respectable
man
proposed
as
that
of
a
person
likely
to
be
able
to
point
out
the
this
was
the
signal
for
the
onset
immediately
upon
the
toast
being
given
a
hitchins
a
farmer
of
seaford
duly
prepared
for
the
purpose
got
upon
the
table
and
with
candle
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
read
the
following
garbled
passage
from
my
to
lord
but
let
us
hear
what
the
younger
ellman
said
had
seen
them
employed
in
drawing
beach
gravel
as
had
been
already
described
one
of
them
the
leader
worked
with
a
bell
about
his
neck
oh
the
envy
of
surrounding
nations
and
admiration
of
the
world
oh
what
a
constitution
what
a
happy
country
impudent
radicals
to
want
to
reform
a
parliament
under
which
men
enjoy
such
blessings
on
such
a
subject
it
is
impossible
under
to
trust
one
pen
however
this
i
will
say
that
here
is
much
more
than
enough
to
make
me
rejoice
in
the
ruin
of
the
farmers
and
i
do
with
all
my
heart
thank
god
for
it
that
it
appears
absolutely
necessary
the
present
race
of
them
should
be
totally
broken
up
in
sussex
at
any
rate
order
to
put
an
end
to
this
cruelty
and
insolence
towards
the
labourers
who
are
by
far
the
greater
number
and
who
are
men
and
a
little
better
men
too
than
such
employers
as
these
who
are
in
fact
monsters
in
human
i
had
not
the
register
by
me
and
could
not
detect
the
garbling
all
the
words
that
i
have
put
in
italics
this
hitchins
left
out
in
the
reading
what
sort
of
man
he
must
be
the
public
will
easily
no
sooner
had
hitchins
done
than
up
started
ingram
a
farmer
of
rottendean
who
was
the
second
person
in
the
drama
for
all
had
been
duly
prepared
and
moved
that
i
should
be
out
of
the
some
few
of
the
webb
hallites
joined
by
about
six
or
eight
of
the
dark
from
brighton
which
is
only
eight
miles
off
joined
in
this
cry
i
rose
that
they
might
see
the
man
that
they
had
to
put
out
fortunately
not
one
of
them
attempted
to
approach
me
they
were
like
the
mice
that
resolved
that
a
bell
should
be
put
round
the
cat
neck
however
a
considerable
hubbub
took
place
at
last
however
the
chairman
kemp
whose
conduct
was
fair
and
manly
having
given
my
health
i
proceeded
to
address
the
company
in
substance
as
stated
here
below
and
it
is
curious
enough
that
even
those
who
upon
my
health
being
given
had
taken
their
hats
and
gone
out
of
the
room
and
amongst
whom
ellman
the
younger
was
one
came
back
formed
a
crowd
and
were
just
as
silent
and
attentive
as
the
rest
of
the
company
note
written
at
i
must
here
before
i
insert
the
speech
which
has
appeared
in
the
the
brighton
papers
and
in
most
of
the
london
papers
except
the
base
sinking
and
the
or
which
is
i
well
know
a
mere
tool
in
the
hands
of
two
whose
greediness
and
folly
i
have
so
often
had
to
expose
and
which
paper
is
maintained
by
a
contrivance
which
i
will
amply
expose
in
my
next
i
must
before
i
insert
this
speech
remark
that
ellman
the
younger
has
to
a
gentleman
whom
i
know
to
be
incapable
of
falsehood
disavowed
the
proceeding
of
hitchins
on
which
i
have
to
observe
that
the
disavowal
to
have
any
weight
must
be
public
or
be
made
to
me
as
to
the
provocation
that
i
have
given
the
ellmans
i
am
upon
reflection
ready
to
confess
that
i
may
have
laid
on
the
lash
without
a
due
regard
to
mercy
the
fact
is
that
i
have
so
long
had
the
misfortune
to
be
compelled
to
keep
a
parcel
of
fellows
like
scarlett
in
order
that
i
am
like
a
drummer
that
has
been
used
to
flog
old
offenders
become
i
ought
to
have
considered
the
ellmans
as
and
to
have
suited
my
tickler
to
the
tenderness
of
their
i
hear
that
ingram
of
rottendean
who
moved
for
my
being
turned
out
of
the
room
and
who
looked
so
foolish
when
he
had
to
turn
himself
out
is
an
officer
of
yeomanry
a
ploughman
spoiled
this
man
would
i
dare
say
have
been
a
very
good
husbandman
but
the
unnatural
working
of
the
has
sublimated
him
out
of
his
senses
that
greater
doctor
peel
will
bring
him
down
mr
hitchins
i
am
told
after
going
away
came
back
stood
on
the
the
door
being
open
and
while
i
was
speaking
exclaimed
oh
the
fools
how
they
open
their
mouths
how
they
suck
it
all
in
suck
in
hitchins
was
it
honey
that
dropped
from
my
lips
was
it
flattery
amongst
other
things
i
said
that
i
liked
the
plain
names
of
and
better
than
that
of
and
the
prospect
i
held
out
to
them
was
that
of
a
description
to
catch
their
applause
but
this
hitchins
seems
to
be
a
very
silly
person
indeed
the
following
is
a
portion
of
the
speech
the
toast
having
been
and
that
too
in
the
extraordinary
manner
we
have
witnessed
i
will
at
any
rate
with
your
permission
make
a
remark
or
two
on
that
manner
if
the
person
who
has
made
the
opposition
had
been
actuated
by
a
spirit
of
fairness
and
justice
he
would
not
have
confined
himself
to
a
detached
sentence
of
the
paper
from
which
he
has
read
but
would
have
taken
the
whole
together
for
by
taking
a
particular
sentence
and
leaving
out
all
the
rest
what
writing
is
there
that
will
not
admit
of
a
wicked
interpretation
as
to
the
particular
part
which
has
been
read
i
should
not
perhaps
if
i
had
seen
it
and
had
had
time
to
cool
a
little
it
was
in
a
register
sent
from
norfolk
have
sent
it
forth
in
terms
so
very
general
as
to
embrace
all
the
farmers
of
this
county
but
as
to
those
of
them
who
put
bell
round
the
labourer
i
beg
leave
to
be
now
repeating
in
its
severest
sense
every
word
of
the
passage
that
has
been
born
in
a
bred
up
at
the
with
a
on
my
back
taking
great
delight
in
all
the
pursuits
of
farmers
liking
their
society
and
having
amongst
them
my
most
esteemed
friends
it
is
natural
that
i
should
feel
and
i
do
feel
uncommonly
anxious
to
prevent
as
far
as
i
am
able
that
total
ruin
which
now
menaces
them
but
the
labourer
was
i
to
have
no
feeling
for
him
was
not
he
my
too
and
was
i
not
to
feel
indignation
against
those
farmers
who
had
had
the
to
put
the
bell
round
his
neck
and
thus
wantonly
insult
and
degrade
the
class
to
whose
toils
they
owed
their
own
ease
the
statement
of
the
fact
was
not
mine
i
read
it
in
the
newspaper
as
having
come
from
ellman
the
younger
he
in
a
very
laudable
manner
expressed
his
at
it
and
was
not
i
to
express
at
what
ellman
felt
horror
that
gentleman
and
webb
hall
may
monopolize
all
the
wisdom
in
matters
of
political
economy
but
are
they
or
rather
is
ellman
alone
to
engross
all
the
feeling
too
it
was
here
denied
that
ellman
had
said
the
bell
had
been
put
on
by
very
well
then
the
complained
of
passage
has
been
productive
of
benefit
to
the
farmers
of
this
county
for
as
the
thing
stood
in
the
newspapers
the
natural
and
unavoidable
inference
was
that
that
atrocious
that
inhuman
act
was
an
act
of
sussex
farmers
thursday
lewes
is
in
a
valley
of
the
this
town
is
at
eight
distance
to
the
south
or
thereabouts
there
is
a
great
extent
of
rich
meadows
above
and
below
lewes
the
town
itself
is
a
model
of
solidity
and
neatness
the
buildings
all
substantial
to
the
very
the
pavements
good
and
complete
the
shops
nice
and
clean
the
people
and
though
last
not
least
the
girls
remarkably
pretty
as
indeed
they
are
in
most
parts
of
sussex
round
faces
features
small
little
hands
and
wrists
plump
arms
and
bright
eyes
the
sussex
men
too
are
remarkable
for
their
good
looks
a
baxter
a
stationer
at
lewes
showed
me
a
account
which
is
a
very
complete
thing
of
the
kind
the
inns
are
good
at
lewes
the
people
civil
and
not
servile
and
the
charges
really
considering
the
taxes
far
below
what
one
could
reasonably
from
lewes
to
brighton
the
road
winds
along
between
the
hills
of
the
south
downs
which
in
this
mild
weather
are
mostly
beautifully
green
even
at
this
season
with
flocks
of
sheep
feeding
on
brighton
itself
lies
in
a
valley
cut
across
at
one
end
by
the
sea
and
its
extension
or
has
swelled
up
the
sides
of
the
hills
and
has
run
some
distance
up
the
the
first
thing
you
see
in
approaching
brighton
from
lewes
is
a
splendid
on
one
side
of
the
road
and
a
heap
of
low
shabby
nasty
houses
irregularly
built
on
the
other
side
this
is
always
the
case
where
there
is
a
barrack
how
soon
a
reformed
parliament
would
make
both
disappear
brighton
is
a
very
pleasant
place
for
a
remarkably
so
the
the
very
name
of
which
has
so
long
been
a
subject
of
laughter
all
over
the
country
lies
in
the
gorge
of
the
valley
and
amongst
the
old
houses
of
the
town
the
grounds
which
can
not
i
think
exceed
a
couple
or
three
acres
are
surrounded
by
a
wall
neither
lofty
nor
above
this
rise
some
trees
bad
in
sorts
stunted
in
growth
and
dirty
with
smoke
as
to
the
palace
as
the
brighton
newspapers
call
it
the
apartments
appear
to
be
all
upon
the
ground
floor
and
when
you
see
the
thing
from
a
distance
you
think
you
see
a
parcel
of
of
various
dimensions
sticking
up
out
of
the
mouths
of
so
many
enormous
squat
decanters
take
a
square
box
the
sides
of
which
are
three
feet
and
a
half
and
the
height
a
foot
and
a
half
take
a
large
cut
off
the
green
of
the
leaves
leave
the
stalks
inches
long
tie
these
round
with
a
string
three
inches
from
the
top
and
put
the
turnip
on
the
middle
of
the
top
of
the
box
then
take
four
turnips
of
half
the
size
treat
them
in
the
same
way
and
put
them
on
the
corners
of
the
box
then
take
a
considerable
number
of
bulbs
of
the
the
narcissus
the
hyacinth
the
tulip
the
crocus
and
others
let
the
leaves
of
each
have
sprouted
to
about
an
inch
more
or
less
according
to
the
size
of
the
bulb
put
all
these
pretty
promiscuously
but
pretty
thickly
on
the
top
of
the
box
then
stand
off
and
look
at
your
architecture
there
that
only
you
must
cut
some
windows
in
the
sides
of
the
box
as
to
what
you
ought
to
put
the
box
that
is
a
subject
far
above
my
brighton
is
naturally
a
place
of
resort
for
and
a
shifty
swarm
is
of
course
assembled
here
some
of
the
fellows
who
had
endeavoured
to
disturb
our
harmony
at
the
dinner
at
lewes
were
parading
amongst
this
swarm
on
the
cliff
you
may
always
know
them
by
their
lank
jaws
the
stiffeners
round
their
necks
their
hidden
or
shirts
their
stays
their
false
shoulders
hips
and
haunches
their
and
by
their
skins
colour
of
veal
warmed
a
little
and
then
powdered
with
dirty
these
vermin
excepted
the
people
at
brighton
make
a
very
fine
figure
the
are
very
nice
in
all
their
concerns
the
houses
are
excellent
built
chiefly
with
a
blue
or
purple
brick
and
appear
to
be
the
general
taste
i
can
easily
believe
this
to
be
a
very
healthy
place
the
open
downs
on
the
one
side
and
the
open
sea
on
the
other
no
inlet
cove
or
river
and
of
course
no
i
have
spent
this
evening
very
pleasantly
in
a
company
of
reformers
who
though
plain
tradesmen
and
mechanics
know
i
am
quite
satisfied
more
about
the
questions
that
agitate
the
country
than
any
equal
number
of
lords
friday
january
came
home
by
the
way
of
cuckfield
worth
and
instead
of
by
uckfield
grinstead
and
godstone
and
got
into
the
same
road
again
at
croydon
the
roads
being
nearly
parallel
lines
and
at
no
great
distance
from
each
other
the
soil
is
nearly
the
same
with
the
exception
of
the
fine
oak
country
between
godstone
and
grinstead
which
does
not
go
so
far
westward
as
my
homeward
bound
road
where
the
land
opposite
the
spot
just
spoken
of
becomes
more
of
a
moor
than
a
clay
and
though
there
are
oaks
they
are
not
nearly
so
fine
as
those
on
the
other
road
the
tops
are
flatter
the
side
are
sometimes
higher
than
the
middle
shoot
a
certain
proof
that
the
has
met
with
something
that
it
does
not
i
see
that
curteis
has
thought
it
necessary
to
state
in
the
public
papers
that
had
to
with
my
being
at
the
dinner
at
battle
who
the
devil
thought
he
had
why
was
it
not
an
ordinary
and
had
i
not
as
much
right
there
as
he
he
has
said
too
that
did
not
that
i
was
to
be
at
the
dinner
how
should
he
why
was
it
necessary
to
apprise
him
of
it
any
more
than
the
porter
of
the
inn
he
has
said
that
he
did
not
hear
of
any
deputation
to
invite
me
to
the
dinner
and
can
not
find
that
there
was
any
have
i
said
that
there
was
any
invitation
at
all
there
was
but
i
have
not
said
so
i
went
to
the
dinner
for
my
like
another
man
without
knowing
or
caring
who
would
be
at
it
but
if
curteis
thought
it
necessary
to
say
so
much
he
might
have
said
a
little
more
he
might
have
said
that
he
twice
addressed
himself
to
me
in
a
very
peculiar
manner
and
that
i
never
addressed
myself
to
him
except
in
answer
and
if
he
had
thought
necessary
upon
this
subject
also
he
might
have
found
that
though
always
the
first
to
speak
or
hold
out
the
hand
to
a
artisan
or
labourer
i
never
did
the
same
to
a
man
of
rank
or
riches
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
curteis
might
have
said
too
that
unless
i
had
gone
to
the
dinner
the
party
would
according
to
appearances
have
been
very
that
i
found
him
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
tables
with
less
than
thirty
persons
in
the
room
that
the
number
swelled
up
to
about
one
hundred
and
thirty
that
no
person
was
at
the
other
table
that
i
took
my
seat
at
it
and
that
that
table
became
almost
immediately
crowded
from
one
end
to
the
other
to
these
curteis
when
his
hand
was
in
might
have
added
that
he
turned
himself
in
his
chair
and
listened
to
my
speech
with
the
greatest
attention
that
he
bade
me
by
name
good
night
when
he
retired
that
he
took
not
a
man
away
with
him
and
that
the
gentleman
who
was
called
on
to
replace
him
in
the
chair
whose
name
i
have
forgotten
had
got
from
his
seat
during
the
evening
to
come
and
shake
me
by
the
hand
all
these
things
curteis
might
have
said
but
the
fact
is
he
has
been
bullied
by
the
base
newspapers
and
he
has
not
been
able
to
muster
up
courage
to
act
the
manly
part
and
which
too
he
would
have
found
to
be
the
part
in
the
end
when
he
gave
the
toast
money
and
less
he
turned
himself
towards
me
and
said
that
is
a
toast
that
i
am
sure
approve
mr
cobbett
to
which
i
answered
it
would
be
made
good
sir
if
of
parliament
would
do
their
i
appeal
to
all
the
gentlemen
present
for
the
truth
of
what
i
say
perhaps
curteis
in
his
heart
did
not
like
to
give
my
health
if
that
was
the
case
he
ought
to
have
left
the
chair
and
retired
is
the
best
course
and
see
what
difficulties
curteis
has
involved
himself
in
by
not
pursuing
it
i
have
no
doubt
that
he
was
agreeably
surprised
when
he
saw
and
heard
me
why
not
then
after
all
that
has
been
said
about
cobbett
he
is
a
devilish
pleasant
frank
and
clever
fellow
at
any
rate
how
much
better
this
would
have
been
than
to
act
the
part
that
curteis
has
the
editors
of
the
chronicle
and
lewes
have
out
of
mere
modesty
i
dare
say
fallen
a
little
into
curteis
strain
in
closing
their
account
in
their
paper
of
the
of
the
lewes
meeting
they
say
that
i
addressed
the
company
at
some
length
as
reported
in
their
supplement
published
on
thursday
the
and
then
they
think
it
necessary
to
add
for
ourselves
we
can
say
that
we
never
saw
cobbett
until
the
meeting
at
battle
now
had
it
not
been
for
pure
bashfulness
they
would
doubtless
have
added
that
when
they
did
see
me
they
were
profuse
in
expressions
of
their
gratitude
to
me
for
having
merely
their
in
my
register
a
thing
which
as
i
told
them
i
myself
had
forgotten
when
too
they
were
speaking
in
reference
to
a
speech
made
in
the
hall
of
one
of
the
finest
specimens
of
oratory
that
has
ever
been
given
in
any
assembly
it
was
without
doubt
out
of
pure
compassion
for
the
perverted
taste
of
their
lewes
readers
that
they
suppressed
the
fact
that
the
agent
of
the
paper
at
lewes
sent
them
word
that
it
was
useless
for
them
to
send
any
account
of
the
meeting
unless
that
account
contained
cobbett
speech
that
he
the
agent
could
have
sold
a
hundred
papers
that
morning
if
they
had
contained
cobbett
speech
but
could
not
sell
one
without
it
i
myself
by
mere
accident
heard
this
message
delivered
to
a
third
person
by
their
agent
at
lewes
and
as
i
said
before
it
must
have
been
pure
tenderness
towards
their
readers
that
made
the
editors
suppress
a
fact
so
injurious
to
the
reputation
of
those
readers
in
point
of
however
at
last
these
editors
seem
to
have
triumphed
over
all
feelings
of
this
sort
for
having
printed
off
a
placard
advertising
their
supplement
in
which
placard
no
mention
was
made
of
they
grown
bold
all
of
a
sudden
took
a
and
in
large
letters
put
into
their
placard
cobbett
speech
at
so
that
at
a
little
distance
the
placard
seemed
to
relate
to
nothing
else
and
there
was
the
finest
specimen
of
oratory
left
to
find
its
way
into
the
world
under
the
auspices
of
my
rustic
harangue
good
god
what
will
this
world
come
to
we
shall
have
to
laugh
at
the
workings
of
envy
in
the
very
worms
that
we
breed
in
our
bodies
the
old
times
its
opponent
the
new
times
the
courier
and
the
tramper
called
the
traveller
the
fellows
who
conduct
these
vehicles
these
wretched
fellows
their
very
livers
burning
with
envy
have
hasted
to
inform
their
readers
that
they
have
authority
to
state
that
lord
ashburnham
and
fuller
were
not
present
at
the
dinner
at
battle
where
cobbett
health
was
drunk
these
fellows
have
now
authority
to
state
that
there
were
no
two
men
who
dined
at
battle
that
i
should
not
prefer
as
companions
to
lord
ashburnham
and
fuller
commonly
called
jack
fuller
seeing
that
i
am
no
admirer
of
and
that
of
all
things
on
earth
i
abhor
a
head
like
a
drum
all
noise
and
emptiness
these
scribes
have
also
authority
to
state
that
they
amuse
me
and
the
public
too
by
declining
rapidly
in
their
sale
from
their
exclusion
of
my
country

huntingdon
journal
through
ware
and
royston
to
huntingdon
monday
morning
came
from
london
yesterday
noon
to
this
town
on
my
way
to
huntingdon
my
road
was
through
ware
royston
is
just
within
the
line
on
the
cambridgeshire
side
which
divides
hertfordshire
from
cambridgeshire
on
this
road
as
on
almost
all
the
others
going
from
it
the
enormous
has
swelled
out
to
the
distance
of
about
six
or
seven
the
land
till
you
come
nearly
to
ware
which
is
in
hertfordshire
and
which
is
miles
from
the
is
chiefly
a
strong
and
deep
loam
with
the
gravel
a
good
distance
from
the
surface
the
land
is
good
but
i
observed
only
three
fields
of
swedish
turnips
in
the
miles
and
no
wheat
drilled
the
wheat
is
sown
on
ridges
of
great
width
sometimes
on
ridges
of
ten
at
others
on
ridges
of
seven
on
those
of
five
four
three
and
even
two
feet
wide
yet
the
bottom
is
manifestly
not
very
wet
generally
and
that
there
is
not
a
bottom
of
clay
is
clear
from
the
poor
growth
of
the
oak
trees
all
the
trees
are
shabby
in
this
country
and
the
eye
is
incessantly
offended
by
the
sight
of
which
are
seldom
suffered
to
disgrace
even
the
meanest
lands
in
hampshire
or
sussex
as
you
approach
ware
the
bottom
becomes
chalk
of
a
dirtyish
colour
and
in
some
parts
far
below
the
surface
after
you
quit
ware
which
is
a
mere
market
town
the
land
grows
by
degrees
poorer
the
chalk
lies
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
surface
till
you
come
to
the
open
within
a
few
miles
of
royston
along
here
the
land
is
poor
enough
it
is
not
the
stiff
red
loam
mixed
with
large
flints
lying
upon
the
chalk
such
as
you
see
in
the
north
of
hampshire
but
a
whitish
sort
of
clay
with
little
yellow
flattish
stones
amongst
it
sure
signs
of
a
hungry
soil
yet
this
land
bears
wheat
royston
is
at
the
foot
of
this
high
poor
land
or
rather
in
a
dell
the
open
side
of
which
looks
towards
the
north
it
is
a
common
market
town
not
mean
but
having
nothing
of
beauty
about
it
and
having
on
it
on
three
of
the
sides
out
of
the
four
those
very
ugly
things
which
have
all
the
nakedness
without
any
of
the
smoothness
of
downs
tuesday
morning
immediately
upon
quitting
royston
you
come
along
for
a
considerable
distance
with
enclosed
fields
on
the
left
and
open
on
the
right
here
the
land
is
excellent
a
dark
rich
loam
free
from
stones
on
chalk
beneath
at
a
great
distance
the
land
appears
for
a
mile
or
two
to
resemble
that
at
and
near
faversham
in
kent
which
i
have
before
noticed
the
fields
on
the
left
seem
to
have
been
enclosed
by
act
of
parliament
and
they
certainly
are
the
most
beautiful
tract
of
that
i
ever
saw
their
extent
may
be
from
ten
to
thirty
acres
each
divided
by
hedges
exceedingly
well
planted
and
raised
the
whole
tract
is
nearly
a
perfect
level
the
cultivation
neat
and
the
stubble
heaps
such
as
remain
out
giving
a
proof
of
great
crops
of
straw
while
on
land
with
a
chalk
bottom
there
is
seldom
any
want
of
a
proportionate
quantity
of
grain
even
here
however
i
saw
but
few
swedish
turnips
and
those
not
good
nor
did
i
see
any
wheat
drilled
and
observed
that
in
many
parts
the
sowing
had
been
performed
in
a
most
careless
manner
especially
at
about
three
miles
from
royston
where
some
parts
of
the
broad
lands
seemed
to
have
had
the
seed
flung
along
them
with
a
shovel
while
other
parts
contained
only
here
and
there
a
blade
or
at
least
were
so
thinly
supplied
as
to
make
it
almost
doubtful
whether
they
had
not
been
wholly
missed
in
some
parts
the
middles
only
of
the
ridges
were
sown
thickly
this
is
shocking
husbandry
a
norfolk
or
a
kentish
farmer
would
have
sowed
a
bushel
and
a
half
of
seed
to
the
acre
here
and
would
have
had
a
far
better
plant
of
about
four
miles
i
think
it
is
from
royston
you
come
to
the
estate
of
lord
hardwicke
you
see
the
house
at
the
end
of
an
avenue
about
two
miles
long
which
however
wants
the
main
thing
namely
fine
and
lofty
trees
the
soil
here
begins
to
be
a
very
stiff
loam
at
top
clay
beneath
for
a
considerable
distance
and
in
some
places
beds
of
yellow
gravel
with
very
large
stones
mixed
in
it
the
land
is
generally
cold
a
great
deal
of
draining
is
wanted
and
yet
the
bottom
is
such
as
not
to
be
favourable
to
the
growth
of
the
of
which
sort
i
have
not
seen
one
tree
since
i
left
london
a
grove
such
as
i
saw
at
weston
in
herefordshire
would
here
be
a
thing
to
attract
the
attention
of
all
ranks
and
all
ages
what
then
would
they
say
on
beholding
a
wood
of
oaks
hickories
chestnuts
walnuts
locusts
and
maples
in
america
lord
hardwicke
avenue
appears
to
be
lined
with
elms
chiefly
they
are
shabby
he
might
have
had
for
the
ash
will
grow
on
sand
on
gravel
on
clay
on
chalk
or
in
swamps
it
is
surprising
that
those
who
planted
these
rows
of
trees
did
not
observe
how
well
the
ash
grows
here
in
the
in
the
plantations
everywhere
the
ash
is
fine
the
ash
is
the
of
all
our
large
trees
look
at
trees
on
any
part
of
the
sea
coast
you
will
see
them
all
even
the
firs
lean
from
the
sea
breeze
except
the
ash
you
will
see
the
oak
on
the
side
of
the
breeze
but
the
ash
stands
upright
as
if
in
a
warm
woody
dell
we
have
no
tree
that
attains
a
greater
height
than
the
ash
and
certainly
none
that
equals
it
in
beauty
of
leaf
it
bears
pruning
better
than
any
other
tree
its
timber
is
one
of
the
most
useful
and
as
underwood
and
it
far
exceeds
all
others
of
english
growth
from
the
trees
of
an
avenue
like
that
of
lord
hardwicke
a
hundred
pounds
worth
of
fuel
might
if
the
trees
were
ash
be
cut
every
year
in
prunings
necessary
to
preserve
the
health
and
beauty
of
the
trees
yet
on
this
same
land
has
his
lordship
planted
many
acres
of
larches
and
firs
these
appear
to
have
been
planted
about
twelve
years
if
instead
of
these
he
had
planted
ash
four
years
from
the
seed
bed
and
once
removed
had
cut
them
down
within
an
inch
of
the
ground
the
second
year
after
planting
and
had
planted
them
at
four
feet
apart
he
would
now
have
had
about
six
thousand
on
an
average
twelve
feet
long
on
each
acre
of
land
in
his
plantation
which
at
each
would
have
been
worth
somewhere
nearly
forty
pounds
an
acre
he
might
now
have
cut
the
poles
leaving
about
to
stand
upon
an
acre
to
come
to
trees
and
while
these
were
growing
to
timber
the
underwood
would
for
poles
hoops
spars
rods
and
faggots
have
been
worth
or
thirty
pounds
an
acre
every
ten
years
can
beggarly
stuff
like
larches
and
firs
ever
be
profitable
to
this
extent
ash
is
timber
fit
for
the
wheelwright
at
the
age
of
twenty
years
or
less
what
can
you
do
with
a
rotten
fir
thing
at
that
age
this
estate
of
lord
hardwicke
appears
to
be
very
large
there
is
a
part
which
is
apparently
in
his
own
hands
as
indeed
the
whole
must
soon
be
unless
he
give
up
all
idea
of
rent
or
unless
he
can
the
fundholder
or
get
again
afloat
on
the
sea
of
in
this
part
of
his
land
there
is
a
fine
piece
of
in
rows
at
about
eighteen
inches
distant
from
each
other
they
are
now
manuring
it
with
mixed
with
some
dung
and
i
see
several
heaps
of
hereabouts
the
directions
for
doing
this
are
contained
in
my
as
taught
me
by
william
gauntlet
of
the
land
is
all
along
here
laid
up
in
those
wide
and
high
ridges
which
i
saw
in
gloucestershire
going
from
gloucester
to
oxford
as
i
have
already
mentioned
these
ridges
are
ploughed
or
but
they
are
ploughed
up
again
for
every
at
an
inn
near
lord
hardwicke
i
saw
the
finest
parcel
of
pigeons
i
ever
saw
in
my
between
this
place
and
huntingdon
is
the
village
of
caxton
which
very
much
resembles
almost
a
village
of
the
same
size
in
where
i
saw
the
women
dragging
harrows
to
harrow
in
the
corn
certainly
this
village
resembles
nothing
english
except
some
of
the
rascally
rotten
boroughs
in
cornwall
and
devonshire
on
which
a
just
providence
seems
to
have
entailed
its
curse
the
land
just
about
here
does
seem
to
be
really
bad
the
face
of
the
country
is
naked
the
few
scrubbed
trees
that
meet
the
eye
and
even
the
are
covered
with
a
yellow
moss
all
is
bleak
and
comfortless
and
just
on
the
most
dreary
part
of
this
most
dreary
scene
stands
almost
opportunely
tendering
its
friendly
one
arm
to
the
it
has
recently
been
and
written
on
in
conspicuous
characters
for
the
benefit
i
suppose
of
those
who
can
not
exist
under
the
thought
of
wheat
at
four
shillings
a
not
far
from
this
is
a
new
house
which
the
coachman
says
belongs
to
a
mr
cheer
who
if
report
speaks
truly
is
not
however
notwithstanding
his
name
guilty
of
the
sin
of
making
people
either
drunkards
or
gluttons
certainly
the
spot
on
which
he
has
built
his
house
is
one
of
the
most
ugly
that
i
ever
saw
few
spots
have
everything
that
you
could
wish
to
find
but
this
according
to
my
judgment
has
everything
that
every
man
of
ordinary
taste
would
wish
to
the
country
changes
but
little
till
you
get
quite
to
huntingdon
the
land
is
generally
quite
open
or
in
large
fields
strong
that
wants
a
good
deal
of
draining
very
few
turnips
of
any
sort
are
raised
and
of
course
few
sheep
and
cattle
kept
few
trees
and
those
scrubbed
few
woods
and
those
small
few
hills
and
those
hardly
worthy
of
the
name
all
which
when
we
see
them
make
us
cease
to
wonder
that
this
country
is
so
famous
for
such
it
has
doubtless
been
in
all
times
and
to
this
circumstance
huntingdon
that
is
to
say
huntingdun
or
huntingdown
unquestionably
owes
its
name
because
does
not
mean
land
but
open
and
land
and
the
saxon
word
is
when
you
come
down
near
to
the
town
itself
the
scene
suddenly
totally
and
most
agreeably
changes
the
separates
godmanchester
from
huntingdon
and
there
is
i
think
no
very
great
difference
in
the
population
of
the
two
both
together
do
not
make
up
a
population
of
more
than
about
five
thousand
souls
huntingdon
is
a
slightly
built
town
compared
with
lewes
for
instance
the
houses
are
not
in
general
so
high
nor
made
of
such
solid
and
costly
materials
the
shops
are
not
so
large
and
their
contents
not
so
costly
there
is
not
a
show
of
so
much
business
and
so
much
opulence
but
huntingdon
is
a
very
clean
and
nice
place
contains
many
elegant
houses
and
the
environs
are
beautiful
above
and
below
the
bridge
under
which
the
ouse
passes
are
the
most
beautiful
and
by
far
the
most
beautiful
meadows
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
the
meadows
at
lewes
at
guildford
at
farnham
at
winchester
at
salisbury
at
exeter
at
gloucester
at
hereford
and
even
at
canterbury
are
nothing
compared
with
those
of
huntingdon
in
point
of
beauty
here
are
no
reeds
here
is
no
sedge
no
unevennesses
of
any
sort
here
are
of
hundreds
of
acres
in
extent
with
a
river
winding
through
them
full
to
the
brink
of
these
meadows
is
the
and
so
pretty
a
spot
so
level
so
smooth
so
green
and
of
such
an
extent
i
never
saw
and
never
expected
to
see
from
the
bridge
you
look
across
the
valleys
first
to
the
west
and
then
to
the
east
the
valleys
terminate
at
the
foot
of
rising
ground
well
set
with
trees
from
amongst
which
church
spires
raise
their
heads
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
find
a
more
delightful
spot
than
this
in
the
world
to
my
fancy
and
every
one
to
his
taste
the
prospect
from
this
bridge
far
surpasses
that
from
richmond
all
that
i
have
yet
seen
of
huntingdon
i
like
exceedingly
it
is
one
of
those
pretty
clean
unstenched
unconfined
places
that
tend
to
lengthen
life
and
make
it
happy
journal
hertfordshire
and
buckinghamshire
to
albans
through
edgware
stanmore
and

returning
by
redbourn
hempstead
and
chesham
albans
june
from
kensington
to
this
place
through
edgware
stanmore
and
watford
the
crop
is
almost
entirely
hay
from
fields
of
permanent
grass
manured
by
dung
and
other
matter
brought
from
the
near
the
wen
where
they
have
had
the
of
the
irish
and
other
perambulating
labourers
the
hay
is
all
in
rick
some
miles
further
down
it
is
nearly
all
in
towards
stanmore
and
watford
a
third
perhaps
of
the
grass
remains
to
be
cut
it
is
curious
to
see
how
the
thing
regulates
itself
we
saw
all
the
way
down
squads
of
labourers
of
different
departments
migrating
from
tract
to
tract
leaving
the
cleared
fields
behind
them
and
proceeding
on
towards
the
work
to
be
yet
performed
and
then
as
to
the
classes
of
labourers
the
with
their
scythes
on
their
shoulders
were
in
front
going
on
towards
the
standing
crops
while
the
were
coming
on
behind
towards
the
grass
already
cut
or
cutting
the
weather
is
fair
and
warm
so
that
the
on
the
road
are
pouring
out
their
beer
pretty
fast
and
are
getting
a
good
share
of
the
wages
of
these
thirsty
souls
it
is
an
exchange
of
beer
for
sweat
but
the
get
after
all
the
far
greater
part
of
the
sweat
for
if
it
were
not
for
the
tax
the
beer
would
sell
for
a
pot
instead
of
fivepence
of
this
the
jews
and
jobbers
get
about
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
the
different
labours
are
divided
as
to
the
the
mowers
are
all
the
haymakers
all
scotchmen
toil
hard
enough
in
scotland
but
when
they
go
from
home
it
is
not
to
if
you
please
they
are
found
in
gardens
and
especially
in
gardens
tying
up
flowers
picking
dead
leaves
off
exotics
peeping
into
publishing
the
banns
of
marriage
between
the
and
blossoms
against
a
wall
with
a
hammer
that
weighs
half
an
ounce
they
have
backs
as
straight
and
shoulders
as
square
as
heroes
of
waterloo
and
who
can
blame
them
the
digging
the
mowing
the
carrying
of
loads
all
the
and
work
they
leave
to
be
performed
by
those
who
have
less
than
they
have
the
great
purpose
of
human
art
the
great
end
of
human
study
is
to
obtain
to
throw
the
burden
of
labour
from
our
own
shoulders
and
fix
it
on
those
of
others
the
crop
of
hay
is
very
large
and
that
part
which
is
in
is
in
very
good
order
we
shall
have
hardly
any
hay
that
is
not
fine
and
sweet
and
we
shall
have
it
carried
to
london
at
less
i
dare
say
than
a
load
that
is
cwt
so
that
here
the
of
will
be
great
indeed
whether
we
shall
have
any
projects
for
taking
hay
into
is
more
than
any
of
us
can
say
for
after
what
we
have
seen
need
we
be
surprised
if
we
were
to
hear
it
proposed
to
take
butter
and
even
milk
into
pawn
in
after
times
the
mad
projects
of
these
days
will
become
proverbial
the
oracle
and
the
men
will
totally
supplant
the
this
is
all
along
here
and
especially
as
far
as
stanmore
a
very
dull
and
ugly
country
flat
and
all
and
elms
few
of
any
kind
and
few
labourers
being
wanted
scarcely
any
cottages
and
gardens
which
form
one
of
the
great
beauties
of
a
country
stanmore
is
on
a
hill
but
it
looks
over
a
country
of
little
variety
though
rich
what
a
difference
between
the
view
here
and
those
which
carry
the
eye
over
the
coppices
the
the
and
the
orchards
of
kent
it
is
miserable
land
from
stanmore
to
watford
where
we
get
into
hertfordshire
hence
to
saint
albans
there
is
generally
chalk
at
bottom
with
a
red
tenacious
loam
at
top
with
flints
grey
on
the
outside
and
dark
blue
within
wherever
this
is
the
soil
the
wheat
grows
well
the
crops
and
especially
that
of
the
barley
are
very
fine
and
very
forward
the
wheat
in
general
does
not
appear
to
be
a
heavy
crop
but
the
ears
seem
as
if
they
would
be
full
from
bottom
to
top
and
we
have
had
so
much
heat
that
the
grain
is
pretty
sure
to
be
plump
let
the
weather
for
the
rest
of
the
summer
be
what
it
may
the
produce
depends
more
on
the
weather
previous
to
the
coming
out
of
the
ear
than
on
the
subsequent
weather
in
the
northern
parts
of
america
where
they
have
some
years
not
heat
enough
to
bring
the
indian
corn
to
perfection
i
have
observed
that
if
they
have
about
fifteen
days
with
the
thermometer
at
before
the
ear
makes
its
appearance
the
crop
never
fails
though
the
weather
may
be
ever
so
unfavourable
afterwards
this
allies
with
the
old
remark
of
the
country
people
in
england
that
makes
or
mars
the
wheat
for
it
is
in
may
that
the
ear
and
the
grains
are
june
set
out
at
four
this
morning
for
redbourn
and
then
turned
off
to
the
westward
to
go
to
high
wycombe
through
hempstead
and
chesham
the
is
good
all
the
way
the
barley
and
oats
good
enough
till
i
came
to
hempstead
but
the
land
along
here
is
very
fine
a
red
tenacious
flinty
loam
upon
a
bed
of
chalk
at
a
yard
or
two
beneath
which
in
my
opinion
is
the
very
best
that
we
have
in
england
the
fields
here
like
those
in
the
rich
parts
of
devonshire
will
bear
perpetual
grass
any
of
them
will
become
upland
meadows
the
land
is
in
short
excellent
and
it
is
a
real
the
from
redbourn
to
hempstead
are
very
fine
oaks
ashes
and
beeches
some
of
the
finest
of
each
sort
and
the
very
finest
ashes
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
they
are
in
great
numbers
and
make
the
fields
look
most
beautiful
no
villanous
things
of
the
offend
the
eye
here
the
custom
is
in
this
part
of
hertfordshire
and
i
am
told
it
continues
into
bedfordshire
to
leave
a
round
the
ploughed
part
of
the
fields
to
bear
grass
and
to
make
hay
from
so
that
the
grass
being
now
made
into
hay
every
corn
field
has
a
closely
mowed
grass
walk
about
ten
feet
wide
all
round
it
between
the
corn
and
the
hedge
this
is
most
beautiful
the
hedges
are
now
full
of
the
shepherd
rose
honeysuckles
and
all
sorts
of
wild
flowers
so
that
you
are
upon
a
grass
walk
with
this
most
beautiful
of
all
flower
gardens
and
shrubberies
on
your
one
hand
and
with
the
corn
on
the
other
and
thus
you
go
from
field
to
field
on
foot
or
on
horseback
the
sort
of
corn
the
sort
of
underwood
and
timber
the
shape
and
size
of
the
fields
the
height
of
the
the
height
of
the
trees
all
continually
varying
talk
of
indeed
what
that
man
ever
invented
under
the
name
of
can
equal
these
fields
in
hertfordshire
this
is
a
profitable
system
too
for
the
ground
under
hedges
bears
little
corn
and
it
bears
very
good
grass
something
however
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
soil
for
it
is
not
all
land
that
will
bear
grass
fit
for
hay
perpetually
and
when
the
land
will
not
do
that
these
headlands
would
only
be
a
harbour
for
weeds
and
the
seeds
of
which
would
fill
the
fields
with
their
mischievous
mr
tull
has
observed
upon
the
great
use
of
it
is
curious
enough
that
these
headlands
cease
soon
after
you
get
into
buckinghamshire
at
first
you
see
a
field
a
grass
headland
then
it
comes
to
a
field
one
and
at
the
end
of
five
or
six
miles
they
wholly
cease
hempstead
is
a
very
pretty
town
with
beautiful
environs
and
there
is
a
canal
that
comes
near
it
and
that
goes
on
to
london
it
lies
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
it
is
clean
substantially
built
and
a
very
pretty
place
altogether
between
hempstead
and
chesham
the
land
is
not
so
good
i
came
into
buckinghamshire
before
i
got
into
the
latter
place
passed
over
two
commons
but
still
the
land
is
not
bad
it
is
drier
nearer
the
chalk
and
not
so
red
the
wheat
continues
good
though
not
heavy
but
the
barley
on
the
land
that
is
not
very
good
is
light
begins
to
look
and
the
backward
oats
are
very
short
on
the
still
thinner
lands
the
barley
and
oats
must
be
a
very
short
people
do
not
sow
the
ground
is
so
dry
and
i
should
think
that
the
will
be
very
short
for
ought
to
be
at
least
by
this
time
if
i
had
swedes
to
sow
i
would
sow
them
now
and
upon
ground
very
deeply
and
finely
broken
i
would
sow
directly
after
the
plough
not
being
half
an
hour
behind
it
and
would
roll
the
ground
as
hard
as
possible
i
am
sure
the
plants
would
come
up
even
without
rain
and
the
moment
the
rain
came
they
would
grow
chesham
is
a
nice
little
town
lying
in
a
deep
and
narrow
valley
with
a
stream
of
water
running
through
it
all
along
the
country
that
i
have
come
the
labourers
dwellings
are
good
they
are
made
of
what
they
call
that
is
to
say
a
frame
of
wood
and
a
single
brick
thick
filling
up
the
vacancies
between
the
timber
they
are
generally
covered
with
tile
not
by
any
means
but
they
are
good
and
you
see
here
as
in
kent
susses
surrey
and
hampshire
and
indeed
in
almost
every
part
of
england
that
most
interesting
of
all
objects
that
which
is
such
an
honour
to
england
and
that
which
distinguishes
it
from
all
the
rest
of
the
world
namely
those
kept
and
productive
little
gardens
round
the
labourers
which
are
seldom
unornamented
with
more
or
less
of
flowers
we
have
only
to
look
at
these
to
know
what
sort
of
people
english
labourers
are
these
gardens
are
the
answer
to
the
and
the
shut
your
mouths
you
scotch
economists
cease
bawling
brougham
and
you
edinburgh
reviewers
till
can
show
us
something
not
but
approaching
towards
a
likeness
of
the
orchards
all
along
this
country
are
by
no
means
bad
not
like
those
of
herefordshire
and
the
north
of
kent
but
a
great
deal
better
than
in
many
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
the
are
pretty
abundant
and
particularly
good
there
are
not
many
of
the
as
they
call
them
in
kent
and
hampshire
that
is
to
say
the
little
black
cherry
the
name
of
which
is
a
corruption
from
the
french
in
the
singular
and
in
the
plural
i
saw
the
little
boys
in
many
places
set
to
keep
the
birds
off
the
cherries
which
reminded
me
of
the
time
when
i
followed
the
same
occupation
and
also
of
the
toll
that
i
used
to
take
in
payment
the
children
are
all
along
here
i
mean
the
little
children
locked
out
of
the
doors
while
the
fathers
and
mothers
are
at
work
in
the
fields
i
saw
many
little
groups
of
this
sort
and
this
is
one
advantage
of
having
plenty
of
room
on
the
outside
of
a
house
i
never
saw
the
country
children
better
clad
or
look
cleaner
and
fatter
than
they
look
here
and
i
have
the
very
great
pleasure
to
add
that
i
do
not
think
i
saw
three
acres
of
in
this
whole
tract
of
fine
country
from
albans
to
redbourn
from
redbourn
to
hempstead
and
from
hempstead
to
chesham
in
all
the
houses
where
i
have
been
they
use
the
roasted
rye
instead
of
coffee
or
tea
and
i
saw
one
gentleman
who
had
sown
a
piece
of
rye
a
grain
not
common
in
this
part
of
the
country
for
the
express
purpose
it
costs
about
three
farthings
a
pound
roasted
and
ground
into
the
pay
of
the
labourers
varies
from
eight
to
twelve
shillings
grass
mowers
get
two
shillings
two
quarts
of
what
they
call
strong
beer
and
as
much
small
beer
as
they
can
drink
after
quitting
chesham
i
passed
through
a
wood
resembling
as
nearly
as
possible
the
woods
in
the
more
cultivated
parts
of
long
island
with
these
exceptions
that
there
the
woods
consist
of
a
great
variety
of
trees
and
of
more
beautiful
foliage
here
there
are
only
two
sorts
of
trees
beech
and
oak
but
the
wood
at
bottom
was
precisely
like
an
american
wood
none
of
that
stuff
which
we
generally
call
underwood
the
trees
standing
very
thick
in
some
places
the
shade
so
complete
as
never
to
permit
herbage
below
no
bushes
of
any
sort
and
nothing
to
impede
your
steps
but
little
spindling
trees
here
and
there
grown
up
from
the
seed
the
trees
here
are
as
lofty
too
as
they
generally
are
in
the
long
island
woods
and
as
straight
except
in
cases
where
you
find
clumps
of
the
which
sometimes
go
much
above
a
hundred
feet
high
as
straight
as
a
line
the
oaks
seem
here
to
vie
with
the
beeches
in
size
as
well
as
in
loftiness
and
straightness
i
saw
several
oaks
which
i
think
were
more
than
eighty
feet
high
and
several
with
a
clear
stem
of
more
than
forty
feet
being
pretty
nearly
as
far
through
at
that
distance
from
the
ground
as
at
bottom
and
i
think
i
saw
more
than
one
with
a
clear
stem
of
fifty
feet
a
foot
and
a
half
through
at
that
distance
from
the
ground
this
is
by
far
the
finest
that
i
ever
saw
in
england
the
road
through
the
wood
is
winding
and
brings
you
out
at
the
corner
of
a
field
lying
sloping
to
the
south
three
sides
of
it
bordered
by
wood
and
the
field
planted
as
an
orchard
this
is
precisely
what
you
see
in
so
many
thousands
of
places
in
america
i
had
passed
through
hempstead
a
little
while
before
which
certainly
gave
its
name
to
the
township
in
which
i
lived
in
long
island
and
which
i
used
to
write
contrary
to
the
orthography
of
the
place
never
having
heard
of
such
a
place
as
in
england
passing
through
hempstead
i
gave
my
mind
a
toss
back
to
long
island
and
this
beautiful
wood
and
orchard
really
made
me
almost
conceit
that
i
was
there
and
gave
rise
to
a
thousand
interesting
and
pleasant
reflections
on
quitting
the
wood
i
crossed
the
great
road
from
london
to
wendover
went
across
the
park
of
drake
and
up
a
steep
hill
towards
the
great
road
leading
to
wycombe
drake
is
a
very
beautiful
place
and
has
a
great
deal
of
very
fine
timber
upon
it
i
think
i
counted
pretty
nearly
oak
trees
worth
on
an
average
five
pounds
growing
within
twenty
yards
of
the
road
that
i
was
going
along
drake
has
some
thousands
of
these
i
dare
say
besides
his
beech
and
therefore
will
be
able
to
stand
a
tug
with
the
fundholders
for
some
time
when
i
got
to
high
wycombe
i
found
everything
a
week
earlier
than
in
the
rich
part
of
hertfordshire
high
wycombe
as
if
the
name
was
ironical
lies
along
the
bottom
of
a
narrow
and
deep
valley
the
hills
on
each
side
being
very
steep
indeed
the
valley
runs
somewhere
about
from
east
to
west
and
the
wheat
on
the
hills
facing
the
south
will
if
this
weather
continue
be
fit
to
reap
in
ten
days
i
saw
one
field
of
oats
that
a
bold
farmer
would
cut
next
monday
wycombe
is
a
very
fine
and
very
clean
market
town
the
people
all
looking
extremely
well
the
girls
somewhat
larger
featured
and
larger
boned
than
those
in
sussex
and
not
so
and
more
like
the
girls
of
america
and
that
is
saying
quite
as
much
as
any
reasonable
woman
can
expect
or
wish
for
the
hills
on
the
south
side
of
wycombe
form
a
park
and
estate
now
the
property
of
smith
who
was
a
banker
or
at
nottingham
who
was
made
a
lord
in
the
time
of
pitt
and
who
purchased
this
estate
of
the
late
marquis
of
landsdowne
one
of
whose
titles
is
baron
wycombe
wycombe
is
one
of
those
famous
things
called
boroughs
and
votes
in
this
borough
send
sir
john
dashwood
and
sir
thomas
baring
to
the
collective
wisdom
the
landlord
where
i
put
up
the
name
of
dashwood
but
had
who
the
was
there
would
be
no
forgettings
of
this
sort
if
these
together
with
representatives
were
called
upon
to
pay
the
share
of
the
national
debt
due
from
high
wycombe
between
high
wycombe
and
beaconsfield
where
the
soil
is
much
about
that
last
described
the
wheat
continued
to
be
equally
early
with
that
about
wycombe
as
i
approached
uxbridge
i
got
off
the
chalk
upon
a
gravelly
bottom
and
then
from
uxbridge
to
shepherd
bush
on
a
bottom
of
clay
and
with
here
and
there
a
wheat
or
a
form
the
features
of
this
most
ugly
country
which
would
have
been
perfectly
unbearable
after
quitting
the
neighbourhoods
of
hempstead
chesham
and
high
wycombe
had
it
not
been
for
the
diversion
i
derived
from
meeting
in
all
the
various
modes
of
conveyance
the
cockneys
going
to
which
is
one
of
those
things
which
nature
herself
would
almost
seem
to
have
provided
for
drawing
off
the
matter
and
giving
occasional
relief
to
the
overcharged
i
have
traversed
what
i
think
may
be
called
an
average
of
england
as
to
some
of
the
best
certainly
and
pretty
nearly
some
of
the
worst
my
observation
as
to
the
wheat
is
that
it
will
be
a
fair
and
average
crop
and
extremely
early
because
though
it
is
not
a
heavy
crop
though
the
ears
are
not
long
they
will
be
full
and
the
earliness
seems
to
preclude
the
possibility
of
blight
and
to
ensure
plump
grain
the
barley
and
oats
must
upon
an
average
be
a
light
crop
the
peas
a
light
crop
and
as
to
beans
unless
there
have
been
rains
where
beans
are
mostly
grown
they
can
not
be
half
a
crop
for
they
will
not
endure
heat
i
tried
masagan
beans
in
long
island
and
could
not
get
them
to
bear
more
than
a
pod
or
two
upon
a
stem
beans
love
cold
land
and
shade
the
earliness
of
the
harvest
for
early
it
must
be
is
always
a
clear
advantage
this
fine
summer
though
it
may
not
lead
to
a
good
crop
of
turnips
has
already
put
safe
into
store
such
a
crop
of
hay
as
i
believe
england
never
saw
before
looking
out
of
the
window
i
see
the
harness
of
the
wiltshire
at
this
moment
going
by
covered
with
the
of
that
county
so
that
the
fine
weather
continues
in
the
west
the
hay
has
all
been
got
in
in
the
chalk
countries
without
a
drop
of
wet
and
when
that
is
the
case
the
farmers
stand
in
no
need
of
oats
the
grass
crops
have
been
large
everywhere
as
well
as
got
in
in
good
order
the
fallows
must
be
in
excellent
order
it
must
be
a
sloven
indeed
that
will
sow
his
wheat
in
foul
ground
next
autumn
and
the
sun
where
the
fallows
have
been
well
stirred
will
have
done
more
to
enrich
the
land
than
all
the
and
all
the
other
means
employed
by
the
hand
of
man
such
a
summer
is
a
great
blessing
and
the
only
is
the
dismal
apprehension
of
not
seeing
such
another
for
many
years
to
come
it
is
favourable
for
poultry
for
colts
for
calves
for
lambs
for
young
animals
of
all
descriptions
not
excepting
the
game
the
partridges
will
be
very
early
they
are
now
getting
into
the
roads
with
their
young
ones
to
roll
in
the
dust
the
first
broods
of
partridges
in
england
are
very
frequently
killed
by
the
wet
and
cold
and
this
is
one
reason
why
the
game
is
not
so
plenty
here
as
it
is
in
countries
more
blest
with
sun
this
will
not
be
the
case
this
year
and
in
short
this
is
one
of
the
finest
years
that
i
ever
knew
wm
cobbett
rural
ride
of
miles
from
kensington
to
uphusband
including
a
rustic
harangue
at
winchester
at
a
dinner
with
the
farmers
on
the
september
near
guildford
surrey
wednesday
this
morning
i
set
off
in
rather
a
drizzling
rain
from
kensington
on
horseback
accompanied
by
my
son
with
an
intention
of
going
to
uphusband
near
andover
which
is
situated
in
the
north
west
corner
of
hampshire
it
is
very
true
that
i
could
have
gone
to
uphusband
by
travelling
only
about
miles
and
in
the
space
of
about
eight
hours
but
my
object
was
not
to
see
inns
and
but
to
see
the
to
see
the
farmers
at
home
and
to
see
the
labourers
in
the
fields
and
to
do
this
you
must
go
either
on
foot
or
on
with
a
gig
you
can
not
get
about
amongst
and
across
fields
through
and
and
to
is
too
slow
leaving
the
labour
out
of
the
question
and
that
is
not
a
trifle
we
went
through
the
at
kensington
and
immediately
turned
down
the
lane
to
our
left
proceeded
on
to
fulham
crossed
putney
bridge
into
surrey
went
over
barnes
common
and
then
going
on
the
upper
side
of
richmond
got
again
into
middlesex
by
crossing
richmond
bridge
all
middlesex
is
notwithstanding
the
millions
upon
millions
which
it
is
continually
sucking
up
from
the
rest
of
the
kingdom
and
though
the
thames
and
its
meadows
are
seen
from
the
road
the
country
is
not
less
ugly
from
richmond
to
chertsey
bridge
through
twickenham
hampton
sunbury
and
sheperton
than
it
is
elsewhere
the
soil
is
a
gravel
at
bottom
with
a
black
loam
at
top
near
the
thames
further
back
it
is
a
sort
of
spewy
gravel
and
the
buildings
consist
generally
of
showy
boxes
and
of
shabby
dwellings
of
labouring
people
who
in
this
part
of
the
country
look
to
be
about
half
dirty
and
have
every
appearance
of
drinking
gin
at
chertsey
where
we
came
into
surrey
again
there
was
a
fair
for
horses
cattle
and
pigs
i
did
not
see
any
sheep
everything
was
exceedingly
cart
colts
two
and
three
years
old
were
selling
for
than
a
of
what
they
sold
for
in
the
cattle
were
of
an
inferior
description
to
be
sure
but
the
price
was
low
almost
beyond
belief
cows
which
would
have
sold
for
in
did
not
get
buyers
at
i
had
no
time
to
inquire
much
about
the
pigs
but
a
man
told
me
that
they
were
near
chertsey
is
and
some
other
pretty
spots
upon
being
shown
this
hill
i
was
put
in
mind
of
fox
and
that
brought
into
my
head
a
grant
that
he
obtained
of
in
this
neighbourhood
in
i
think
the
duke
of
york
obtained
by
act
of
parliament
a
much
larger
grant
of
these
lands
at
oatlands
in
i
think
it
was
but
this
was
natural
enough
this
is
what
would
surprise
nobody
fox
was
another
affair
and
especially
when
taken
into
view
with
what
i
am
now
going
to
relate
in
or
fordyce
the
late
duchess
of
gordon
brother
was
collector
general
or
had
been
of
taxes
in
scotland
and
owed
a
large
arrear
to
the
public
he
was
also
surveyor
of
crown
lands
the
then
opposition
were
for
hauling
him
up
pitt
was
again
in
power
creevey
was
to
bring
forward
the
motion
in
the
house
of
commons
and
fox
was
to
support
it
and
had
actually
spoken
once
or
twice
in
a
preliminary
way
on
the
subject
notice
of
the
motion
was
regularly
given
it
was
put
off
from
time
to
time
and
at
last
fox
to
support
it
i
have
no
books
at
hand
but
the
affair
will
be
found
recorded
in
the
register
it
was
not
owing
to
creevey
that
the
thing
did
not
come
on
i
remember
well
that
it
was
owing
to
fox
other
motives
were
stated
and
those
others
might
be
the
real
motives
but
at
any
rate
the
next
year
or
the
year
after
fox
got
transferred
to
him
a
part
of
that
estate
which
belongs
to
the
and
which
was
once
so
great
called
the
and
of
these
lands
fordyce
long
had
been
and
then
was
the
surveyor
such
are
the
facts
let
the
reader
reason
upon
them
and
draw
the
conclusion
this
county
of
surrey
presents
to
the
eye
of
the
traveller
a
greater
contrast
than
any
other
county
in
england
it
has
some
of
the
very
best
and
some
of
the
worst
lands
not
only
in
england
but
in
the
world
we
were
here
upon
those
of
the
latter
description
for
five
miles
on
the
road
towards
guildford
the
land
is
a
rascally
common
covered
with
poor
heath
except
where
the
gravel
is
so
near
the
top
as
not
to
suffer
even
the
heath
to
grow
here
we
entered
the
enclosed
lands
which
have
the
gravel
at
bottom
but
a
nice
light
black
mould
at
top
in
which
the
trees
grow
very
well
through
and
we
came
out
into
the
london
road
between
ripley
and
guildford
and
immediately
crossing
that
road
came
on
towards
a
village
called
merrow
we
came
out
into
the
road
just
mentioned
at
the
of
a
weston
whose
mansion
and
estate
have
just
passed
as
to
occupancy
into
the
hands
of
some
new
man
at
merrow
where
we
came
into
the
epsom
road
we
found
that
webb
weston
whose
mansion
and
park
are
a
little
further
on
towards
london
had
just
walked
out
and
left
it
in
possession
of
another
new
man
this
gentleman
told
us
last
year
at
the
that
he
was
his
and
i
told
him
it
that
he
was
losing
it
he
is
said
to
be
a
very
worthy
man
very
much
respected
a
very
good
landlord
but
i
dare
say
he
is
one
of
those
who
approved
of
yeomanry
cavalry
to
keep
down
the
jacobins
and
levellers
but
who
in
fact
as
i
always
told
men
of
this
description
have
themselves
and
their
landlords
for
without
them
this
thing
never
could
have
been
done
to
ascribe
the
whole
to
would
be
to
give
to
pitt
and
his
followers
too
much
credit
for
profundity
but
if
the
knaves
who
assembled
at
the
crown
and
anchor
in
the
strand
in
to
put
down
by
the
means
of
prosecutions
and
spies
those
whom
they
called
republicans
and
levellers
if
these
knaves
had
said
let
us
go
to
work
to
induce
the
owners
and
occupiers
of
the
land
to
convey
their
estates
and
their
capital
into
our
hands
and
if
the
government
had
corresponded
with
them
in
views
the
effect
could
not
have
been
more
complete
than
it
has
thus
far
been
the
yeomanry
actually
as
to
the
effect
drew
their
swords
to
keep
the
reformers
at
bay
while
the
were
taking
away
the
estates
and
the
capital
it
was
the
sheep
surrendering
up
the
dogs
into
the
hands
of
the
wolves
lord
onslow
lives
near
merrow
this
is
the
man
that
was
for
many
years
so
famous
as
a
driver
of
he
used
to
be
called
he
has
the
character
of
being
a
very
good
landlord
i
know
he
called
me
a
d
d
several
years
ago
only
i
presume
because
i
was
labouring
to
preserve
to
him
the
means
of
still
driving
while
he
and
others
like
him
and
their
yeomanry
cavalry
were
working
as
hard
to
defeat
my
wishes
and
endeavours
they
say
here
that
some
little
time
back
his
lordship
who
has
at
any
rate
had
the
courage
to
retrench
in
all
sorts
of
ways
was
at
guildford
in
a
gig
with
one
horse
at
the
very
moment
when
spicer
the
who
was
a
chairman
of
the
committee
for
prosecuting
lord
cochrane
and
who
lives
at
esher
came
rattling
in
with
four
horses
and
a
couple
of
they
relate
an
observation
made
by
his
lordship
which
may
or
may
not
be
true
and
which
therefore
i
shall
not
repeat
but
my
lord
there
is
another
sort
of
courage
courage
other
than
that
of
retrenching
that
would
become
you
in
the
present
emergency
i
mean
courage
and
especially
the
courage
of
your
confessing
that
you
were
wrong
when
you
called
the
reformers
jacobins
and
levellers
the
courage
of
now
joining
them
in
their
efforts
to
save
their
country
to
regain
their
freedom
and
to
preserve
to
you
your
estate
which
is
to
be
preserved
you
will
observe
by
no
other
means
than
that
of
a
reform
of
the
parliament
it
is
now
manifest
even
to
fools
that
it
has
been
by
the
instrumentality
of
a
base
and
fraudulent
that
and
jews
have
got
the
estates
into
their
hands
with
what
eagerness
in
did
the
nobility
gentry
and
clergy
rush
forward
to
give
their
sanction
and
their
support
to
the
system
which
then
began
and
which
has
finally
produced
what
we
now
behold
they
assembled
in
all
the
counties
and
put
forth
declarations
that
they
would
take
the
paper
of
the
bank
and
that
they
would
support
the
system
upon
this
occasion
the
county
of
surrey
was
the
very
first
county
and
on
the
list
of
signatures
the
very
name
was
there
may
be
sales
and
conveyances
there
may
be
recoveries
deeds
and
other
parchments
but
this
was
the
real
transfer
this
was
the
real
signing
away
of
the
estates
to
come
to
chilworth
which
lies
on
the
south
side
of
martha
hill
most
people
would
have
gone
along
the
level
road
to
guildford
and
come
round
through
shawford
under
the
hills
but
we
having
seen
enough
of
streets
and
turnpikes
took
across
over
merrow
down
where
the
guildford
is
and
then
mounted
the
surrey
hills
so
famous
for
the
prospects
they
afford
here
we
looked
back
over
middlesex
and
into
buckinghamshire
and
berkshire
away
towards
the
into
essex
and
kent
towards
the
east
over
part
of
sussex
to
the
south
and
over
part
of
hampshire
to
the
west
and
we
are
here
upon
a
bed
of
chalk
where
the
downs
always
afford
good
sheep
food
we
steered
for
martha
chapel
and
went
round
at
the
foot
of
the
lofty
hill
on
which
it
stands
this
brought
us
down
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
and
along
a
into
the
narrow
and
exquisitely
beautiful
vale
of
chilworth
where
we
were
to
stop
for
the
night
this
vale
is
skirted
partly
by
woodlands
and
partly
by
sides
of
hills
tilled
as
corn
fields
the
land
is
excellent
particularly
towards
the
bottom
even
the
arable
fields
are
in
some
places
towards
their
tops
nearly
as
steep
as
the
roof
of
a
tiled
house
and
where
the
ground
is
covered
with
woods
the
ground
is
still
more
steep
down
the
middle
of
the
vale
there
is
a
series
of
ponds
or
small
which
meet
your
eye
here
and
there
through
the
trees
here
are
some
very
fine
farms
a
little
strip
of
meadows
some
and
the
lakes
have
given
rise
to
the
establishment
of
and
the
trees
of
all
sorts
grow
well
here
and
coppices
yield
poles
for
the
and
wood
to
make
charcoal
for
the
they
are
sowing
wheat
here
and
the
land
owing
to
the
fine
summer
that
we
have
had
is
in
a
very
fine
state
the
rain
too
which
yesterday
fell
here
in
great
abundance
has
been
just
in
time
to
make
a
really
good
season
the
turnips
all
the
way
that
we
have
come
are
good
rather
backward
in
some
places
but
in
sufficient
quantity
upon
the
ground
and
there
is
yet
a
good
while
for
them
to
grow
all
the
fall
fruit
is
excellent
and
in
great
abundance
the
grapes
are
as
good
as
those
raised
under
glass
the
apples
are
much
richer
than
in
ordinary
years
the
crop
of
hops
has
been
very
fine
here
as
well
as
everywhere
else
the
crop
not
only
large
but
good
in
quality
they
expect
to
get
pounds
a
hundred
for
them
at
weyhill
fair
that
is
more
than
i
think
they
will
get
the
best
sussex
hops
were
selling
in
the
borough
of
southwark
at
three
pounds
a
hundred
a
few
days
before
i
left
london
the
farnham
hops
bring
double
that
price
but
that
i
think
is
as
much
as
they
will
and
this
is
ruin
to
the
the
with
its
attendant
inconveniences
amounts
to
a
pound
a
hundred
the
picking
drying
and
bagging
to
the
carrying
to
market
not
less
than
here
is
the
sum
of
of
the
money
supposing
the
crop
to
be
half
a
ton
to
the
acre
the
bare
tillage
will
be
the
poles
for
an
acre
can
not
cost
less
than
that
is
another
to
each
hundred
of
hops
this
brings
the
outgoings
to
then
comes
the
manure
then
come
the
and
and
county
rates
and
if
these
leave
one
single
farthing
for
i
think
it
is
strange
i
hear
that
birkbeck
is
expected
home
from
america
it
is
said
that
he
is
coming
to
receive
a
large
legacy
a
thing
not
to
be
overlooked
by
a
person
who
lives
in
a
country
where
he
can
have
for
the
truth
is
i
believe
that
there
has
lately
died
a
gentleman
who
has
bequeathed
a
part
of
his
property
to
pay
the
creditors
of
a
relation
of
his
who
some
years
ago
became
a
bankrupt
and
one
of
whose
creditors
birkbeck
was
what
the
amount
may
be
i
know
not
but
i
have
heard
that
the
bankrupt
had
a
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy
so
that
there
must
be
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
in
settling
the
matter
in
an
equitable
manner
the
would
drawl
it
out
supposing
the
present
system
to
continue
till
in
all
human
probability
there
would
not
be
as
much
left
for
birkbeck
as
would
be
required
to
pay
his
way
back
again
to
the
land
of
promise
i
hope
he
is
coming
here
to
remain
here
he
is
a
very
clever
man
though
he
has
been
very
abusive
and
very
unjust
with
regard
to
me
near
godalming
surrey
thursday
we
started
from
chilworth
this
morning
came
down
the
vale
left
the
village
of
shawford
to
our
right
and
that
of
wonersh
to
our
left
and
crossing
the
river
wey
got
into
the
between
guildford
and
godalming
went
on
through
godalming
and
got
to
lea
which
lies
to
the
snugly
under
hindhead
about
this
was
coming
only
about
eight
miles
a
sort
of
rest
after
the
miles
of
the
day
before
coming
along
the
road
a
farmer
overtook
us
and
as
he
had
known
me
from
seeing
me
at
the
meeting
at
epsom
last
year
i
had
a
part
of
my
main
business
to
perform
namely
to
talk
politics
he
was
going
to
fair
upon
the
mention
of
that
of
a
borough
which
sends
clearly
as
the
sun
at
the
celebrated
charles
long
and
the
scarcely
less
celebrated
robert
ward
to
the
celebrated
house
of
commons
we
began
to
talk
as
it
were
spontaneously
about
lord
lonsdale
and
the
lowthers
the
farmer
wondered
why
the
lowthers
that
were
the
owners
of
so
many
farms
should
be
for
a
system
which
was
so
manifestly
taking
away
the
estates
of
the
landlords
and
the
capital
of
the
farmers
and
giving
them
to
jews
placemen
pensioners
sinecure
people
and
people
of
the
dead
weight
but
his
wonder
ceased
his
eyes
were
opened
and
his
heart
seemed
to
burn
within
him
as
i
talked
to
him
on
the
way
when
i
explained
to
him
the
nature
of
and
and
when
i
described
to
him
certain
districts
of
property
in
westmoreland
and
other
parts
i
had
not
the
book
in
my
pocket
but
my
memory
furnished
me
with
quite
a
sufficiency
of
matter
to
make
him
perceive
that
in
supporting
the
present
system
the
lowthers
were
by
no
means
so
foolish
as
he
appeared
to
think
them
from
the
lowthers
i
turned
to
poyntz
who
lives
at
midhurst
in
sussex
and
whose
name
as
a
i
find
in
a
report
lately
laid
before
the
house
of
commons
and
the
particulars
of
which
i
will
state
another
time
for
the
information
of
the
people
of
sussex
i
used
to
wonder
myself
what
made
poyntz
call
me
a
jacobin
i
used
to
think
that
poyntz
must
be
a
fool
to
support
the
present
system
what
i
have
seen
in
that
report
convinces
me
that
poyntz
is
no
fool
as
far
as
relates
to
his
own
interest
at
any
rate
there
is
a
mine
of
wealth
in
these
here
are
farms
and
manors
and
mines
and
woods
and
forests
and
houses
and
streets
incalculable
in
value
what
can
be
so
proper
as
to
apply
this
public
property
towards
the
discharge
of
a
part
at
least
of
that
public
debt
which
is
hanging
round
the
neck
of
this
nation
like
a
ricardo
proposes
to
seize
upon
a
part
of
the
private
property
of
every
man
to
be
given
to
the
race
at
an
act
of
injustice
like
this
the
mind
revolts
the
foolishness
of
it
besides
is
calculated
to
shock
one
but
in
the
we
see
the
suitable
thing
and
who
can
possibly
object
to
this
except
those
who
amongst
them
now
divide
the
possession
or
benefit
of
this
property
i
have
once
before
mentioned
but
i
will
repeat
it
that
in
pall
mall
for
which
the
prince
of
saxe
coburg
pays
a
rent
to
the
duke
of
marlborough
of
three
thousand
pounds
is
rented
of
this
generous
public
by
that
most
noble
duke
at
the
rate
of
less
than
there
are
three
houses
in
pall
mall
the
whole
of
which
pay
a
rent
the
of
about
fifteen
pounds
i
think
it
is
i
myself
years
ago
paid
three
hundred
pounds
for
one
of
them
to
a
man
that
i
thought
was
the
owner
of
them
but
i
now
find
that
these
houses
belong
to
the
public
the
duke
of
buckingham
house
in
pall
mall
which
is
one
of
the
grandest
in
all
london
and
which
is
not
worth
less
than
seven
or
eight
hundred
pounds
belongs
to
the
public
the
duke
is
the
tenant
and
i
think
he
pays
for
it
much
less
than
twenty
pounds
i
speak
from
memory
here
all
the
way
along
and
therefore
not
positively
i
will
another
time
state
the
particulars
from
the
books
the
book
that
i
am
now
referring
to
is
also
of
a
date
of
some
years
back
but
i
will
mention
all
the
particulars
another
time
talk
of
indeed
talk
of
it
is
the
public
that
is
the
generous
landlord
it
is
the
public
that
lets
its
houses
and
manors
and
mines
and
farms
at
a
cheap
rate
it
certainly
would
not
be
so
good
a
landlord
if
it
had
a
reformed
parliament
to
manage
its
affairs
nor
would
it
suffer
so
many
snug
to
carry
on
their
snugglings
in
the
manner
that
they
do
and
therefore
it
is
obviously
the
interest
of
the
rich
tenants
of
this
poor
public
as
well
as
the
interest
of
the
snugglers
in
corporations
to
prevent
the
poor
public
from
having
such
a
parliament
we
got
into
again
at
lea
and
there
is
nothing
like
as
soldiers
well
know
lea
is
situated
on
the
edge
of
that
immense
heath
which
sweeps
down
from
the
summit
of
hindhead
across
to
the
north
over
innumerable
hills
of
minor
altitude
and
of
an
infinite
variety
of
shapes
towards
farnham
to
the
towards
the
back
leading
from
farnham
to
guildford
and
to
the
east
or
nearly
so
towards
godalming
nevertheless
the
enclosed
lands
at
lea
are
very
good
and
singularly
beautiful
the
timber
of
all
sorts
grows
well
the
land
is
light
and
being
free
from
stones
very
pleasant
to
work
if
you
go
southward
from
lea
about
a
mile
you
get
down
into
what
is
called
in
the
old
acts
of
parliament
the
of
surrey
here
the
land
is
a
stiff
tenacious
loam
at
top
with
blue
and
yellow
clay
beneath
this
weald
continues
on
eastward
and
gets
into
sussex
near
east
grinstead
thence
it
winds
about
under
the
hills
into
kent
here
the
oak
grows
finer
than
in
any
part
of
england
the
trees
are
more
spiral
in
their
form
they
grow
much
faster
than
upon
any
other
land
yet
the
timber
must
be
better
for
in
some
of
the
acts
of
queen
elizabeth
reign
it
is
provided
that
the
oak
for
the
royal
navy
shall
come
out
of
the
wealds
of
surrey
sussex
or
kent
hampshire
friday
from
lea
we
set
off
this
morning
about
six
to
get
again
at
a
worthy
old
friend
at
this
nice
little
plain
our
direct
road
was
right
over
the
heath
through
tilford
to
farnham
but
we
veered
a
little
to
the
left
after
we
came
to
tilford
at
which
place
on
the
green
we
stopped
to
look
at
an
which
when
i
was
a
little
boy
was
but
a
very
little
tree
comparatively
and
which
is
now
take
it
altogether
by
far
the
finest
tree
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
the
stem
or
shaft
is
short
that
is
to
say
it
is
short
before
you
come
to
the
first
limbs
but
it
is
full
feet
at
about
eight
or
ten
feet
from
the
ground
out
of
the
stem
there
come
not
less
than
fifteen
or
sixteen
limbs
many
of
which
are
from
five
to
ten
feet
round
and
each
of
which
would
in
fact
be
considered
a
decent
stick
of
timber
i
am
not
judge
enough
of
timber
to
say
anything
about
the
quantity
in
the
whole
tree
but
my
son
stepped
the
ground
and
as
nearly
as
we
could
judge
the
diameter
of
the
extent
of
the
branches
was
upwards
of
ninety
feet
which
would
make
a
circumference
of
about
three
hundred
feet
the
tree
is
in
full
growth
at
this
moment
there
is
a
little
hole
in
one
of
the
limbs
but
with
that
exception
there
appears
not
the
smallest
sign
of
decay
the
tree
has
made
great
shoots
in
all
parts
of
it
this
last
summer
and
spring
and
there
are
no
appearances
of
upon
the
trunk
such
as
are
regarded
as
the
symptoms
of
full
growth
there
are
many
sorts
of
oak
in
england
two
very
distinct
one
with
a
pale
leaf
and
one
with
a
dark
leaf
this
is
of
the
pale
leaf
the
tree
stands
upon
the
soil
of
which
is
a
light
loam
with
a
hard
sand
stone
a
good
way
beneath
and
probably
clay
beneath
that
the
spot
where
the
tree
stands
is
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
feet
from
the
edge
of
a
little
river
and
the
ground
on
which
it
stands
may
be
about
ten
feet
higher
than
the
bed
of
that
river
in
quitting
tilford
we
came
on
to
the
land
belonging
to
waverly
abbey
and
then
instead
of
going
on
to
the
town
of
farnham
veered
away
to
the
left
towards
wrecklesham
in
order
to
cross
the
farnham
and
alton
and
to
come
on
by
the
side
of
crondall
to
odiham
we
went
a
little
out
of
the
way
to
go
to
a
place
called
the
which
lies
in
the
heath
at
about
a
mile
from
farnham
it
is
a
winding
narrow
valley
down
which
during
the
wet
season
of
the
year
there
runs
a
stream
beginning
at
the
and
emptying
itself
into
the
just
below
which
was
the
seat
of
sir
william
temple
when
swift
was
residing
with
him
we
went
to
this
bourn
in
order
that
i
might
show
my
son
the
spot
where
i
received
the
rudiments
of
my
education
there
is
a
little
in
which
i
used
to
work
when
from
eight
to
ten
years
old
from
which
i
have
scores
of
times
run
to
follow
the
hounds
leaving
the
hoe
to
do
the
best
that
it
could
to
destroy
the
weeds
but
the
most
interesting
thing
was
a
which
goes
from
a
part
of
the
heath
down
to
the
rivulet
as
a
due
mixture
of
pleasure
with
toil
i
with
two
brothers
used
occasionally
to
ourselves
as
the
lawyers
call
it
at
this
our
diversion
was
this
we
used
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
which
was
steeper
than
the
roof
of
a
house
one
used
to
draw
his
arms
out
of
the
sleeves
of
his
and
lay
himself
down
with
his
arms
by
his
sides
and
then
the
others
one
at
head
and
the
other
at
feet
sent
him
rolling
down
the
hill
like
a
barrel
or
a
log
of
wood
by
the
time
he
got
to
the
bottom
his
hair
eyes
ears
nose
and
mouth
were
all
full
of
this
loose
sand
then
the
others
took
their
turn
and
at
every
roll
there
was
a
monstrous
spell
of
laughter
i
had
often
told
my
sons
of
this
while
they
were
very
little
and
i
now
took
one
of
them
to
see
the
spot
but
that
was
not
all
this
was
the
spot
where
i
was
receiving
my
and
this
was
the
sort
of
education
and
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
that
if
i
had
not
received
such
an
education
or
something
very
much
like
it
that
if
i
had
been
brought
up
a
milksop
with
a
everlastingly
at
my
heels
i
should
have
been
at
this
day
as
great
a
fool
as
inefficient
a
mortal
as
any
of
those
frivolous
idiots
that
are
turned
out
from
winchester
and
westminster
schools
or
from
any
of
those
dens
of
dunces
called
colleges
and
universities
it
is
impossible
to
say
how
much
i
owe
to
that
and
i
went
to
return
it
my
thanks
for
the
ability
which
it
probably
gave
me
to
be
one
of
the
greatest
terrors
to
one
of
the
greatest
and
most
powerful
bodies
of
knaves
and
fools
that
ever
were
permitted
to
afflict
this
or
any
other
country
from
the
bourn
we
proceeded
on
to
wrecklesham
at
the
end
of
which
we
crossed
what
is
called
the
river
wey
here
we
found
a
parcel
of
labourers
at
amongst
them
was
an
old
playmate
of
mine
the
account
they
gave
of
their
situation
was
very
dismal
the
harvest
was
over
early
the
is
now
over
and
now
they
are
employed
the
that
is
to
say
not
absolutely
digging
holes
one
day
and
filling
them
up
the
next
but
at
the
expense
of
farmers
and
tradesmen
and
landlords
to
break
stones
into
very
small
pieces
to
make
nice
smooth
roads
lest
the
jolting
in
going
along
them
should
create
bile
in
the
stomachs
of
the
overfed
i
call
upon
mankind
to
witness
this
scene
and
to
say
whether
ever
the
like
of
this
was
heard
of
before
it
is
a
state
of
things
where
all
is
out
of
order
where
that
great
law
of
nature
seems
to
be
set
at
defiance
for
here
are
farmers
to
pay
men
for
working
for
them
and
yet
compelled
to
pay
them
for
working
in
doing
that
which
is
really
of
no
use
to
any
human
being
there
lie
the
unstripped
you
see
a
hundred
things
in
the
neighbouring
fields
that
want
doing
the
fences
are
not
nearly
what
they
ought
to
be
the
very
meadows
to
our
right
and
our
left
in
crossing
this
little
valley
would
occupy
these
men
advantageously
until
the
setting
in
of
the
frost
and
here
are
they
not
as
i
said
before
actually
digging
holes
one
day
and
filling
them
up
the
next
but
to
all
intents
and
purposes
as
uselessly
employed
is
this
canning
of
is
this
the
way
to
increase
or
preserve
a
nation
wealth
is
this
a
sign
of
wise
legislation
and
of
good
government
does
this
thing
work
well
canning
does
it
prove
that
we
want
no
change
true
you
were
born
under
a
kingly
government
and
so
was
i
as
well
as
you
but
i
was
not
born
under
nor
was
i
born
under
a
state
of
things
like
this
i
was
not
born
under
it
and
i
do
not
wish
to
live
under
it
and
with
god
help
i
will
change
it
if
i
can
we
left
these
poor
fellows
after
having
given
them
not
religious
tracts
which
would
if
they
could
make
the
labourer
content
with
half
starvation
but
something
to
get
them
some
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
being
firmly
convinced
that
it
is
the
body
that
wants
filling
and
not
the
mind
however
in
speaking
of
their
low
wages
i
told
them
that
the
farmers
and
were
as
much
objects
of
compassion
as
themselves
which
they
acknowledged
we
immediately
alter
this
crossed
the
road
and
went
on
towards
crondall
upon
a
soil
that
soon
became
stiff
loam
and
flint
at
top
with
a
bed
of
chalk
beneath
we
did
not
go
to
crondall
but
kept
along
over
slade
heath
and
through
a
very
pretty
place
called
well
we
arrived
at
odiham
about
half
after
eleven
at
the
end
of
a
beautiful
ride
of
about
seventeen
miles
in
a
very
fine
and
pleasant
day
saturday
just
after
daylight
we
started
for
this
place
by
the
turnpike
we
could
have
come
through
basingstoke
by
turning
off
to
the
right
or
through
alton
and
alresford
by
turning
off
to
the
left
being
naturally
disposed
towards
a
middle
course
we
chose
to
wind
down
through
then
down
to
ovington
and
into
winchester
by
the
north
entrance
from
wrecklesham
to
winchester
we
have
come
over
roads
and
lanes
of
flint
and
chalk
the
weather
being
dry
again
the
ground
under
you
as
solid
as
iron
makes
a
great
rattling
with
the
horses
feet
the
country
where
the
soil
is
stiff
loam
upon
chalk
is
never
bad
for
corn
not
rich
but
never
poor
there
is
at
no
time
anything
deserving
to
be
called
dirt
in
the
roads
the
buildings
last
a
long
time
from
the
absence
of
fogs
and
also
the
absence
of
humidity
in
the
ground
the
absence
of
dirt
makes
the
people
habitually
cleanly
and
all
along
through
this
country
the
people
appear
in
general
to
be
very
neat
it
is
a
country
for
sheep
which
are
always
sound
and
good
upon
this
iron
soil
the
trees
grow
well
where
there
are
trees
the
woods
and
coppices
are
not
numerous
but
they
are
good
particularly
the
ash
which
always
grows
well
upon
the
chalk
the
oaks
though
they
do
not
grow
in
the
spiral
form
as
upon
the
clays
are
by
no
means
stunted
and
some
of
them
very
fine
trees
i
take
it
that
they
require
a
much
greater
number
of
years
to
bring
them
to
perfection
than
in
the
the
wood
perhaps
may
be
harder
but
i
have
heard
that
the
oak
which
grows
upon
these
hard
bottoms
is
very
frequently
what
the
carpenters
call
the
underwoods
here
consist
almost
entirely
of
hazle
which
is
very
fine
and
much
tougher
and
more
durable
than
that
which
grows
on
soils
with
a
moist
bottom
this
hazle
is
a
thing
of
great
utility
here
it
furnishes
rods
wherewith
to
make
fences
but
its
principal
use
is
to
make
for
the
folding
of
sheep
in
the
fields
these
things
are
made
much
more
neatly
here
than
in
the
south
of
hampshire
and
in
sussex
or
in
any
other
part
that
i
have
seen
chalk
is
the
favourite
soil
of
the
and
at
there
is
an
avenue
of
probably
a
mile
long
each
tree
containing
as
nearly
as
i
can
guess
from
twelve
to
twenty
feet
of
timber
which
as
the
reader
knows
implies
a
tree
of
considerable
size
they
have
probably
been
a
century
or
two
in
growing
but
in
any
way
that
timber
can
be
used
the
timber
of
the
yew
will
last
perhaps
ten
times
as
long
as
the
timber
of
any
other
tree
that
we
grow
in
england
quitting
the
candovers
we
came
along
between
the
two
estates
of
the
two
barings
sir
thomas
who
has
supplanted
the
duke
of
bedford
was
to
our
right
while
alexander
who
has
supplanted
lord
northington
was
on
our
left
the
latter
has
enclosed
as
a
sort
of
outwork
to
his
park
a
pretty
little
down
called
northington
down
in
which
he
has
planted
here
and
there
a
clump
of
trees
but
baring
not
reflecting
that
woods
are
not
like
funds
to
be
made
at
a
heat
has
planted
his
trees
so
that
they
are
covered
with
moss
are
dying
at
the
top
and
are
literally
growing
downward
instead
of
upward
in
short
this
enclosure
and
plantation
have
totally
destroyed
the
beauty
of
this
part
of
the
estate
the
down
which
was
before
very
beautiful
and
formed
a
sort
of
up
to
the
park
pales
is
now
a
marred
ragged
thing
the
dying
trees
which
have
been
planted
long
enough
for
you
not
to
perceive
that
they
have
been
planted
excite
the
idea
of
sterility
in
the
soil
they
do
injustice
to
it
for
as
a
down
it
was
excellent
everything
that
has
been
done
here
is
to
the
injury
of
the
estate
and
discovers
a
most
shocking
want
of
taste
in
the
projector
sir
thomas
plantations
or
rather
those
of
his
father
have
been
managed
more
judiciously
i
do
not
like
to
be
a
sort
of
spy
in
a
man
neighbourhood
but
i
will
tell
sir
thomas
baring
what
i
have
heard
and
if
he
be
a
man
of
sense
i
shall
have
his
thanks
rather
than
his
reproaches
for
so
doing
i
may
have
been
misinformed
but
this
is
what
i
have
heard
that
he
and
also
lady
baring
are
very
charitable
that
they
are
very
kind
and
compassionate
to
their
poor
neighbours
but
that
they
tack
a
sort
of
condition
to
this
charity
that
they
insist
upon
the
objects
of
it
adopting
their
notions
with
regard
to
religion
or
at
least
that
where
the
people
are
not
what
they
deem
they
are
not
objects
of
their
benevolence
i
do
not
say
that
they
are
not
perfectly
sincere
themselves
and
that
their
wishes
are
not
the
best
that
can
possibly
be
but
of
this
i
am
very
certain
that
by
pursuing
this
principle
of
action
where
they
make
one
good
man
or
woman
they
will
make
one
hundred
hypocrites
it
is
not
little
books
that
can
make
a
people
good
that
can
make
them
moral
that
can
restrain
them
from
committing
crimes
i
believe
that
books
of
any
sort
never
yet
had
that
tendency
sir
thomas
does
i
dare
say
think
me
a
very
wicked
man
since
i
aim
at
the
destruction
of
the
funding
system
and
what
he
would
call
a
robbery
of
what
he
calls
the
public
creditor
and
yet
god
help
me
i
have
read
books
enough
and
amongst
the
rest
a
great
part
of
the
religious
tracts
amongst
the
labouring
people
the
first
thing
you
have
to
look
after
is
the
and
from
and
to
secure
these
the
labourer
must
have
and
be
from
and
this
must
come
to
him
from
out
of
his
and
not
from
benevolence
of
any
description
such
being
my
opinion
i
think
sir
thomas
baring
would
do
better
that
he
would
discover
more
real
benevolence
by
using
the
influence
which
he
must
naturally
have
in
his
neighbourhood
to
prevent
a
diminution
in
the
wages
of
labour
sunday
morning
yesterday
was
here
everything
cheap
and
falling
instead
of
rising
if
it
were
last
year
that
produced
the
when
are
our
miseries
to
have
an
end
they
will
end
when
these
men
cease
to
have
sway
and
not
before
i
had
not
been
in
winchester
long
before
i
heard
something
very
interesting
about
the
concerning
the
poor
which
was
lately
issued
here
and
upon
which
i
remarked
in
my
last
register
but
one
in
my
letter
to
sir
thomas
baring
proceeding
upon
the
true
military
principle
i
looked
out
for
which
the
reader
will
naturally
think
difficult
for
to
find
in
a
town
containing
a
having
done
this
i
went
to
the
swan
inn
to
dine
with
the
farmers
this
is
the
manner
that
i
like
best
of
doing
the
thing
do
not
to
be
sure
prevent
us
from
together
they
do
not
authorize
justices
of
the
peace
to
kill
us
because
we
meet
to
dine
without
their
permission
but
i
do
not
like
on
account
i
like
much
better
to
go
and
fall
in
with
the
lads
of
the
land
or
with
anybody
else
at
their
own
places
of
resort
and
i
am
going
to
place
myself
down
at
uphusband
in
excellent
in
the
midst
of
all
the
great
fairs
of
the
west
in
order
before
the
winter
campaign
begins
that
i
may
see
as
many
farmers
as
possible
and
that
they
may
hear
my
opinions
and
i
theirs
i
shall
be
at
weyhill
fair
on
the
of
october
and
perhaps
on
some
of
the
succeeding
days
and
on
one
or
more
of
those
days
i
intend
to
dine
at
the
white
hart
at
andover
what
other
fairs
or
places
i
shall
go
to
i
shall
notify
hereafter
and
this
i
think
the
frankest
and
fairest
way
i
wish
to
see
many
people
and
to
talk
to
them
and
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
wish
to
see
and
to
talk
to
me
what
better
reason
can
be
given
for
a
man
going
about
the
country
and
dining
at
fairs
and
markets
at
the
dinner
at
winchester
we
had
a
good
number
of
opulent
yeomen
and
many
gentlemen
joined
us
after
the
dinner
the
state
of
the
country
was
well
talked
over
and
during
the
much
more
sensible
than
some
other
that
i
have
had
to
remark
on
i
made
the
following
gentlemen
though
many
here
are
i
am
sure
glad
to
i
am
not
vain
enough
to
suppose
that
anything
other
than
that
of
wishing
to
hear
my
opinions
on
the
prospects
before
us
can
have
induced
many
to
choose
to
be
here
to
dine
with
me
i
shall
before
i
sit
down
propose
to
you
a
which
you
will
drink
or
not
as
you
choose
but
i
shall
state
one
particular
wish
in
that
shape
that
it
may
be
the
more
distinctly
understood
and
the
better
remembered
the
wish
to
which
i
allude
relates
to
the
under
that
word
i
mean
to
speak
of
all
that
mass
of
wealth
which
is
vulgarly
called
but
which
is
in
fact
and
may
of
course
be
disposed
of
as
the
parliament
shall
please
there
appears
at
this
moment
an
uncommon
degree
of
anxiety
on
the
part
of
the
parsons
to
see
the
farmers
enabled
to
pay
the
business
of
the
parsons
being
only
with
one
naturally
at
first
sight
wonders
why
they
should
care
so
much
about
the
fact
is
this
they
see
clearly
enough
that
the
landlords
will
never
long
go
without
rents
and
suffer
them
to
enjoy
the
tithes
they
see
too
that
there
must
be
a
struggle
between
the
and
the
they
see
that
there
is
such
a
struggle
they
see
that
it
is
the
taxes
that
are
taking
away
the
rent
of
the
landlord
and
the
capital
of
the
farmer
yet
the
parsons
are
afraid
to
see
the
taxes
reduced
why
because
if
the
taxes
be
reduced
in
any
great
degree
and
nothing
short
of
a
great
degree
will
give
relief
they
see
that
the
interest
of
the
debt
can
not
be
paid
and
they
know
well
that
the
interest
of
the
debt
can
never
be
reduced
until
their
tithes
have
been
reduced
thus
then
they
find
themselves
in
a
great
difficulty
they
wish
the
taxes
to
be
kept
up
and
rents
to
be
paid
too
both
can
not
be
unless
some
means
or
other
be
found
out
of
putting
into
or
keeping
in
the
farmer
pocket
money
that
is
not
now
there
the
scheme
that
appears
to
have
been
fallen
upon
for
this
purpose
is
the
strangest
in
the
world
and
it
must
if
attempted
to
be
put
into
execution
produce
something
little
short
of
open
and
general
commotion
namely
that
of
reducing
the
wages
of
labour
to
a
mark
so
low
as
to
make
the
labourer
a
walking
skeleton
before
i
proceed
further
it
is
right
that
i
communicate
to
you
an
explanation
which
not
an
hour
ago
i
received
from
poulter
relative
to
the
lately
issued
in
this
town
by
a
bench
of
magistrates
of
which
that
gentleman
was
chairman
i
have
not
the
honour
to
be
personally
acquainted
with
poulter
but
certainly
if
i
had
misunderstood
the
manifesto
it
was
right
that
i
should
be
if
possible
made
to
understand
it
poulter
in
company
with
another
gentleman
came
to
me
in
this
inn
and
said
that
the
bench
did
not
mean
that
their
resolutions
should
have
the
effect
of
the
and
that
the
sums
stated
in
the
paper
were
sums
to
be
given
in
the
way
of
we
had
not
the
paper
before
us
and
as
the
paper
contained
a
good
deal
about
relief
i
in
recollection
confounded
the
two
and
said
that
i
had
understood
the
paper
agreeably
to
the
explanation
but
upon
looking
at
the
paper
again
i
see
that
as
to
the
there
was
a
clear
recommendation
to
make
the
what
is
there
stated
however
seeing
that
the
chairman
himself
disavows
this
we
must
conclude
that
the
bench
put
forth
words
not
expressing
their
meaning
to
this
i
must
add
as
connected
with
the
manifesto
that
it
is
stated
in
that
document
that
such
and
such
justices
were
present
and
a
large
and
respectable
number
of
yeomen
who
had
been
invited
to
attend
now
gentlemen
i
was
i
must
confess
struck
with
this
addition
to
the
bench
these
gentlemen
have
not
been
accustomed
to
treat
farmers
with
so
much
attention
it
seemed
odd
that
they
should
want
a
set
of
farmers
to
be
present
to
give
a
sort
of
sanction
to
their
acts
since
my
arrival
in
winchester
i
have
found
however
that
having
them
present
was
not
all
for
that
the
names
of
some
of
these
yeomen
were
actually
inserted
in
the
manuscript
of
the
manifesto
and
that
those
names
were
expunged
the
request
of
the
parties
this
is
a
very
singular
proceeding
then
altogether
it
presents
to
us
a
strong
picture
of
the
diffidence
or
modesty
call
it
which
you
please
of
the
justices
and
it
shows
us
that
the
yeomen
present
did
not
like
to
have
standing
as
giving
sanction
to
the
resolutions
contained
in
the
manifesto
indeed
they
knew
well
that
those
resolutions
never
could
be
acted
upon
they
knew
that
they
could
not
live
in
safety
even
in
the
same
village
with
labourers
paid
at
the
rate
of
and
shillings
to
return
now
gentlemen
to
the
scheme
for
squeezing
rents
out
of
the
bones
of
the
labourer
is
it
not
upon
the
face
of
it
most
monstrously
absurd
that
this
scheme
should
be
resorted
to
when
the
plain
and
easy
and
just
way
of
insuring
rents
must
present
itself
to
every
eye
and
can
be
pursued
by
the
parliament
whenever
it
choose
we
hear
loud
outcries
against
the
the
the
but
what
are
the
facts
why
that
in
great
britain
are
paid
in
or
thereabouts
in
and
to
the
the
army
placemen
and
the
rest
and
yet
nothing
of
all
this
seems
to
be
thought
of
but
the
millions
surely
the
other
and
so
much
larger
sums
might
to
be
thought
of
even
the
millions
are
for
the
far
greater
part
and
not
and
yet
all
this
outcry
is
made
about
these
millions
while
not
a
word
is
said
about
the
other
millions
gentlemen
to
enumerate
all
the
ways
in
which
the
public
money
is
spent
would
take
me
a
week
i
will
mention
two
classes
of
persons
who
are
receivers
of
taxes
and
you
will
then
see
with
what
it
is
that
this
outcry
is
set
up
against
the
and
against
the
amount
of
wages
there
is
a
thing
called
the
incredible
as
it
may
seem
that
such
a
vulgar
appellation
should
be
used
in
such
a
way
and
by
such
persons
it
is
a
fact
that
the
ministers
have
laid
before
the
parliament
an
account
called
the
account
of
the
this
account
tells
how
five
millions
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
are
distributed
annually
amongst
officers
pensioners
retired
commissaries
clerks
and
so
forth
employed
during
the
last
war
if
there
were
nothing
more
entailed
upon
us
by
that
war
this
is
pretty
now
unjust
unnecessary
as
that
war
was
detestable
as
it
was
in
all
its
principles
and
objects
still
to
every
man
who
really
did
or
who
performed
a
soldier
duty
abroad
i
would
give
he
should
not
be
left
destitute
but
gentlemen
is
it
right
for
the
nation
to
keep
on
paying
for
life
crowds
of
young
fellows
such
as
make
up
the
greater
part
of
this
this
is
not
all
however
for
there
are
the
widows
and
the
children
who
have
and
are
to
have
you
seem
surprised
and
well
you
may
but
this
is
the
fact
a
young
fellow
who
has
a
pension
for
life
aye
or
an
old
fellow
either
will
easily
get
a
wife
to
enjoy
it
with
him
and
he
will
i
warrant
him
take
care
that
shall
not
be
so
that
here
is
absolutely
a
premium
for
entering
into
the
holy
state
of
matrimony
the
husband
you
will
perceive
can
not
prevent
the
wife
from
having
the
pension
after
his
death
she
is
in
this
respect
not
his
she
marries
in
fact
with
a
jointure
settled
on
her
the
more
children
the
husband
leaves
the
better
for
the
widow
for
each
child
has
a
pension
for
a
certain
number
of
years
the
man
who
under
such
circumstances
does
not
marry
must
be
a
an
old
man
actually
going
into
the
grave
may
by
the
mere
ceremony
of
marriage
give
any
woman
a
pension
for
life
even
the
widows
and
children
of
insane
officers
are
not
excluded
if
an
officer
now
insane
but
at
large
were
to
marry
there
is
nothing
as
the
thing
now
stands
to
prevent
his
widow
and
children
from
having
pensions
were
such
things
as
these
ever
before
heard
of
in
the
world
were
such
premiums
ever
before
given
for
breeding
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
that
too
while
all
sorts
of
projects
are
on
foot
to
check
the
breeding
of
the
labouring
classes
can
such
a
thing
i
say
it
can
not
and
if
it
could
it
must
inevitably
render
this
country
the
most
contemptible
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
and
yet
not
a
word
of
complaint
is
heard
about
these
five
millions
and
a
quarter
expended
in
this
way
while
the
country
rings
fairly
resounds
with
the
outcry
about
the
six
millions
that
are
given
to
the
labourers
in
the
shape
of
but
which
in
fact
go
for
the
greater
part
to
pay
what
ought
to
be
called
unless
then
we
speak
out
here
unless
we
call
for
redress
here
unless
we
here
seek
relief
we
shall
not
only
be
totally
ruined
but
we
shall
the
other
class
of
persons
to
whom
i
have
alluded
as
having
taxes
bestowed
on
them
are
the
not
of
the
as
by
established
to
be
sure
you
will
say
yes
gentlemen
even
to
the
poor
clergy
of
the
established
church
we
know
well
how
that
church
is
we
know
well
how
many
millions
it
annually
receives
we
know
how
opulent
are
the
bishops
how
rich
they
die
how
rich
in
short
a
body
it
is
and
yet
hundred
thousand
have
within
the
same
number
of
years
been
given
out
of
the
taxes
partly
raised
on
the
labourers
for
the
relief
of
the
clergy
of
that
church
while
it
is
notorious
that
the
livings
are
given
in
numerous
cases
by
twos
and
threes
to
the
same
person
and
while
a
clamour
enough
to
make
the
sky
ring
is
made
about
what
is
given
in
the
shape
of
to
the
labouring
why
gentlemen
what
do
we
want
more
than
this
one
fact
does
not
this
one
fact
sufficiently
characterize
the
system
under
which
we
live
does
not
this
prove
that
a
change
a
great
change
is
wanted
would
it
not
be
more
natural
to
propose
to
get
this
money
back
from
the
church
than
to
squeeze
so
much
out
of
the
bones
of
the
labourers
this
the
parliament
can
do
if
it
pleases
and
this
it
will
do
if
you
do
your
duty
passing
over
several
other
topics
let
me
gentlemen
now
come
to
what
at
the
present
moment
most
nearly
affects
you
namely
the
as
to
in
the
first
place
this
depends
upon
whether
peel
bill
will
be
repealed
as
this
depends
a
good
deal
upon
the
ministers
and
as
i
am
convinced
that
they
know
no
more
what
to
do
in
the
present
emergency
than
the
little
boys
and
girls
that
are
running
up
and
down
the
street
before
this
house
it
is
impossible
for
me
or
for
any
one
to
say
what
will
be
done
in
this
respect
but
my
opinion
is
decided
that
the
bill
will
be
repealed
the
ministers
see
that
if
they
were
to
go
back
to
the
paper
it
would
not
be
the
paper
of
but
a
paper
never
to
be
redeemed
by
gold
that
it
would
be
to
all
intents
and
purposes
that
must
of
necessity
cause
the
complete
overthrow
of
the
government
in
a
very
short
time
if
therefore
the
ministers
see
the
thing
in
this
light
it
is
impossible
that
they
should
think
of
a
repeal
of
peel
bill
there
appeared
last
winter
a
strong
disposition
to
repeal
the
bill
and
i
verily
believe
that
a
repeal
in
effect
though
not
in
name
was
actually
in
contemplation
a
bill
was
brought
in
which
was
described
beforehand
as
intended
to
prolong
the
issue
of
small
notes
and
also
to
prolong
the
time
for
making
bank
of
england
notes
a
legal
tender
this
would
have
been
a
repealing
of
peel
bill
in
great
part
the
bill
when
brought
in
and
when
passed
as
it
finally
was
contained
no
clause
relative
to
legal
tender
and
without
that
clause
it
was
perfectly
nugatory
let
me
explain
to
you
gentlemen
what
this
bill
really
is
in
the
seventeenth
year
of
the
late
king
reign
an
act
was
passed
for
a
time
limited
to
prevent
the
issue
of
notes
payable
to
bearer
on
demand
for
any
sums
less
than
five
pounds
in
the
year
of
the
late
reign
this
act
was
made
and
the
preamble
of
the
act
sets
forth
that
it
is
made
perpetual
because
the
of
small
notes
being
made
has
been
proved
to
be
for
the
good
of
the
nevertheless
in
just
ten
years
afterwards
that
is
to
say
in
the
year
one
thousand
seven
hundred
and
when
the
bank
stopped
payment
this
salutary
act
was
indeed
it
was
absolutely
necessary
for
there
was
no
gold
to
pay
with
it
continued
suspended
until
when
peel
bill
was
passed
when
a
bill
was
passed
to
suspend
it
still
further
until
the
year
you
will
observe
then
that
last
winter
there
were
yet
three
years
to
come
during
which
the
banks
might
make
small
notes
if
they
would
yet
this
new
bill
was
passed
last
winter
to
authorize
them
to
make
small
notes
until
the
year
the
measure
was
wholly
uncalled
for
it
appeared
to
be
altogether
unnecessary
but
as
i
have
just
said
the
intention
was
to
introduce
into
this
bill
a
clause
to
continue
the
until
and
that
would
indeed
have
made
a
great
alteration
in
the
state
of
things
and
if
extended
to
the
bank
of
england
would
have
been
in
effect
a
complete
repeal
of
peel
bill
it
was
fully
expected
by
the
country
bankers
that
the
legal
tender
clause
would
have
been
inserted
but
before
it
came
to
the
trial
the
ministers
gave
way
and
the
clause
was
not
inserted
the
reason
for
their
giving
way
i
do
verily
believe
had
its
principal
foundation
in
their
perceiving
that
the
public
would
clearly
see
that
such
a
measure
would
make
the
merely
assignats
the
legal
tender
not
having
been
enacted
the
bill
can
do
nothing
towards
augmenting
the
quantity
of
circulating
medium
as
the
law
now
stands
bank
of
england
notes
are
in
effect
a
if
i
owe
a
debt
of
twenty
pounds
and
tender
bank
of
england
notes
in
payment
the
law
says
that
you
shall
not
arrest
me
that
you
may
bring
your
action
if
you
like
that
i
may
pay
the
notes
into
court
that
you
may
go
on
with
your
action
that
you
shall
pay
all
the
costs
and
i
none
at
last
you
gain
your
action
you
obtain
judgment
and
execution
or
whatever
else
the
everlasting
law
allows
of
and
what
have
you
got
then
why
the
the
same
identical
notes
the
sheriff
will
bring
you
you
will
not
take
them
go
to
law
with
the
sheriff
then
he
pays
the
into
court
more
costs
for
you
to
pay
and
thus
you
go
on
but
without
ever
touching
or
seeing
gold
now
gentlemen
peel
bill
puts
an
end
to
all
this
pretty
work
on
the
first
day
of
next
may
if
you
have
a
handful
of
a
country
banker
rags
and
go
to
him
for
payment
he
will
tender
you
bank
of
england
notes
and
if
you
like
the
paying
of
costs
you
may
go
to
law
for
gold
but
when
the
first
of
next
may
comes
he
must
put
gold
into
your
hands
in
exchange
for
your
notes
if
you
choose
it
or
you
may
clap
a
bailiff
hand
upon
his
shoulder
and
if
he
choose
to
pay
into
court
he
must
pay
in
gold
and
pay
your
costs
also
as
far
as
you
have
gone
this
makes
a
strange
alteration
in
the
thing
and
everybody
must
see
that
the
bank
of
england
and
the
country
bankers
that
all
in
short
are
preparing
for
the
first
of
may
it
is
clear
that
there
must
be
a
farther
diminution
of
the
it
is
hard
to
say
the
precise
degree
of
effect
that
this
will
have
upon
prices
but
that
it
must
bring
them
down
is
clear
and
for
my
own
part
i
am
fully
persuaded
that
they
will
come
down
to
the
standard
of
prices
in
france
be
those
prices
what
they
may
this
indeed
was
acknowledged
by
huskisson
in
the
agricultural
report
of
that
two
countries
so
near
together
both
having
gold
as
a
currency
or
standard
should
differ
very
widely
from
each
other
in
the
prices
of
is
next
to
impossible
and
therefore
when
our
legal
tender
shall
be
completely
done
away
to
the
prices
of
france
you
must
come
and
those
prices
can
not
i
think
in
the
present
state
of
europe
much
exceed
three
or
four
shillings
a
bushel
for
good
wheat
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
is
impossible
with
the
present
taxes
and
rates
and
tithes
to
pay
any
rent
at
all
with
prices
upon
that
scale
let
jews
and
the
whole
tribe
of
say
what
they
will
you
know
that
it
is
impossible
as
you
also
know
it
would
be
cruelly
unjust
to
wring
from
the
labourer
the
means
of
paying
rent
while
those
taxes
and
tithes
remain
something
must
be
taken
off
the
labourers
wages
have
already
been
reduced
as
low
as
possible
all
public
pay
and
salaries
ought
to
be
reduced
and
the
tithes
also
ought
to
be
reduced
as
they
might
be
to
a
great
amount
without
any
injury
to
religion
the
interest
of
the
debt
ought
to
be
largely
reduced
but
as
none
of
the
others
can
with
any
show
of
justice
take
place
without
a
reduction
of
the
tithes
and
as
i
am
for
confining
myself
to
one
object
at
present
i
will
give
you
as
a
toast
leaving
you
to
drink
it
or
not
as
you
please
large
reduction
of
somebody
proposed
to
drink
this
toast
with
times
which
was
accordingly
done
and
the
sound
might
have
been
heard
down
to
the
upon
some
gentleman
giving
i
took
occasion
to
remind
the
company
that
the
last
time
i
was
at
winchester
we
had
the
memorable
fight
with
lockhart
the
brave
and
his
sable
friends
i
reminded
them
that
it
was
in
that
same
room
that
i
told
them
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
lockhart
and
those
sable
gentlemen
would
become
enlightened
and
i
observed
that
if
we
were
to
judge
from
a
man
language
there
was
not
a
in
england
that
more
keenly
felt
than
lockhart
the
truth
of
those
predictions
which
i
had
put
forth
at
the
castle
on
the
day
alluded
to
i
reminded
the
company
that
i
sailed
for
america
in
a
few
days
after
that
meeting
that
they
must
be
well
aware
that
on
the
day
of
the
meeting
i
knew
that
i
was
taking
leave
of
the
country
but
i
observed
that
i
had
not
been
in
the
least
depressed
by
that
circumstance
because
i
relied
with
perfect
confidence
on
being
in
this
same
place
again
to
enjoy
as
i
now
did
a
triumph
over
my
adversaries
after
this
hector
gave
a
reform
in
the
house
of
which
was
drunk
with
great
enthusiasm
and
hector
health
having
been
given
he
in
returning
thanks
urged
his
brother
yeomen
and
freeholders
to
do
their
duty
by
coming
forward
in
county
meeting
and
giving
their
support
to
those
noblemen
and
gentlemen
that
were
willing
to
stand
forward
for
a
reform
and
for
a
reduction
of
taxation
i
held
forth
to
them
the
example
of
the
county
of
kent
which
had
done
itself
so
much
honour
by
its
conduct
last
spring
what
these
gentlemen
in
hampshire
will
do
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
if
nothing
be
done
by
them
they
will
certainly
be
ruined
and
that
ruin
they
will
certainly
deserve
it
was
to
the
farmers
that
the
government
owed
its
strength
to
carry
on
the
war
having
them
with
it
in
consequence
of
a
false
and
bloated
prosperity
it
cared
not
a
straw
for
anybody
else
if
they
therefore
now
do
their
duty
if
they
all
like
the
yeomen
and
farmers
of
kent
come
boldly
forward
everything
will
be
done
necessary
to
preserve
themselves
and
their
country
and
if
they
do
not
come
forward
they
will
as
men
of
property
be
swept
from
the
face
of
the
earth
the
noblemen
and
gentlemen
who
are
in
parliament
and
who
are
disposed
to
adopt
measures
of
effectual
relief
can
not
move
with
any
hope
of
success
unless
backed
by
the
yeomen
and
farmers
and
the
middling
classes
throughout
the
country
generally
i
do
not
mean
to
confine
myself
to
yeomen
and
farmers
but
to
take
in
all
tradesmen
and
men
of
property
with
these
at
their
back
or
rather
at
the
back
of
these
there
are
men
enough
in
both
houses
of
parliament
to
propose
and
to
urge
measures
suitable
to
the
exigency
of
the
case
but
without
the
middling
classes
to
the
those
noblemen
and
gentlemen
can
do
nothing
even
the
ministers
themselves
if
they
were
so
disposed
and
they
must
be
so
disposed
at
last
could
make
none
of
the
reforms
that
are
necessary
being
actually
urged
on
by
the
middle
classes
of
the
this
is
a
very
important
consideration
a
new
man
as
minister
might
indeed
propose
the
reforms
himself
but
these
men
opposition
as
well
as
ministry
are
so
to
the
things
that
have
brought
all
this
ruin
upon
the
country
that
they
absolutely
stand
in
need
of
an
overpowering
call
from
the
people
to
justify
them
in
doing
that
which
they
themselves
may
think
just
and
which
they
may
know
to
be
necessary
for
the
salvation
of
the
country
they
dare
not
take
the
lead
in
the
necessary
reforms
it
is
too
much
to
be
expected
of
any
men
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
pledged
and
situated
as
these
ministers
are
and
therefore
unless
the
people
will
do
their
duty
they
will
have
themselves
and
only
themselves
to
thank
for
their
ruin
and
for
that
load
of
disgrace
and
for
that
insignificance
worse
than
disgrace
which
seems
after
so
many
years
of
renown
to
be
attaching
themselves
to
the
name
of
england
sunday
evening
we
came
along
the
through
wherwell
and
andover
and
got
to
this
place
about
this
country
except
at
the
village
and
town
just
mentioned
is
very
open
a
thinnish
soil
upon
a
bed
of
chalk
between
winchester
and
wherwell
we
came
by
some
hundreds
of
acres
of
ground
that
was
formerly
most
beautiful
down
which
was
broken
up
in
times
and
which
is
now
a
district
of
thistles
and
other
weeds
if
i
had
such
land
as
this
i
would
soon
make
it
down
again
i
would
for
once
that
is
to
say
if
i
had
the
money
get
it
quite
clean
prepare
it
as
for
sowing
turnips
get
the
turnips
if
possible
feed
them
off
early
or
plough
the
ground
if
i
got
no
turnips
sow
thick
with
and
seeds
of
all
sorts
early
in
september
let
the
crop
stand
till
the
next
july
feed
it
then
slenderly
with
sheep
and
dig
up
all
thistles
and
rank
weeds
that
might
appear
keep
feeding
it
but
not
too
close
during
the
summer
and
the
fall
and
keep
on
feeding
it
for
ever
after
as
a
down
the
itself
would
last
for
many
years
and
as
it
disappeared
its
place
would
be
supplied
by
the
grass
that
sort
which
was
most
congenial
to
the
soil
would
at
last
stifle
all
other
sorts
and
the
land
would
become
a
valuable
down
as
formerly
i
see
that
some
plantations
of
ash
and
of
hazle
have
been
made
along
here
but
with
great
submission
to
the
planters
i
think
they
have
gone
the
wrong
way
to
work
as
to
the
mode
of
preparing
the
ground
they
have
planted
and
that
is
right
they
have
the
ground
and
that
is
also
right
but
they
have
brought
the
bottom
soil
to
the
top
and
that
is
always
and
especially
where
the
bottom
soil
is
gravel
or
chalk
or
clay
i
know
that
some
people
will
say
that
this
is
a
and
let
it
pass
for
that
but
if
any
gentleman
that
is
going
to
plant
trees
will
look
into
my
on
and
into
the
chapter
on
the
he
will
i
think
see
how
conveniently
ground
may
be
trenched
without
bringing
to
the
top
that
soil
in
which
the
young
trees
stand
so
long
without
making
shoots
this
country
though
so
open
has
its
beauties
the
homesteads
in
the
sheltered
bottoms
with
fine
lofty
trees
about
the
houses
and
yards
form
a
beautiful
contrast
with
the
large
open
fields
the
little
villages
running
straggling
along
the
dells
always
with
lofty
trees
and
rookeries
are
very
interesting
objects
even
in
the
winter
you
feel
a
sort
of
satisfaction
when
you
are
out
upon
the
bleak
hills
yourself
at
the
thought
of
the
shelter
which
is
experienced
in
the
dwellings
in
the
valleys
andover
is
a
neat
and
solid
it
is
supported
entirely
by
the
agriculture
around
it
and
how
the
makers
of
ever
came
to
think
of
classing
the
inhabitants
of
such
a
town
as
this
under
any
other
head
than
that
of
employed
in
would
appear
astonishing
to
any
man
who
did
not
know
those
population
return
makers
as
well
as
i
do
the
village
of
uphusband
the
legal
name
of
which
is
hurstbourn
tarrant
is
as
the
reader
will
recollect
a
great
favourite
with
me
not
the
less
so
certainly
on
account
of
the
excellent
that
it
affords
through
hampshire
berkshire
surrey
and
sussex
between
october
and
december
miles
to
at
uphusband
a
little
village
in
a
deep
dale
about
five
miles
to
the
north
of
andover
and
about
three
miles
to
the
south
of
the
hills
at
the
wheat
is
sown
here
and
up
and
as
usual
at
this
time
of
the
year
looks
very
beautiful
the
wages
of
the
labourers
brought
down
to
shillings
a
a
horrible
thing
to
think
of
but
i
hear
it
is
still
worse
in
wiltshire
went
to
weyhill
fair
at
which
i
was
about
years
ago
when
i
rode
a
little
pony
and
remember
how
proud
i
was
on
the
occasion
but
i
also
remember
that
my
brothers
two
out
of
three
of
whom
were
older
than
i
thought
it
unfair
that
my
father
selected
me
and
my
own
reflections
upon
the
occasion
have
never
been
forgotten
by
me
the
of
october
is
the
about
used
some
few
years
ago
to
be
carried
home
by
the
less
perhaps
than
and
yet
the
of
these
are
perhaps
as
high
on
an
average
as
they
were
then
the
countenances
of
the
farmers
were
descriptive
of
their
ruinous
state
i
never
in
all
my
life
beheld
a
more
mournful
scene
there
is
a
upon
another
part
of
the
down
and
there
i
saw
horses
keeping
pace
in
depression
with
the
sheep
a
pretty
numerous
group
of
the
from
andover
and
the
neighbourhood
were
the
only
persons
that
had
smiles
on
their
faces
i
was
struck
with
a
young
farmer
trotting
a
horse
backward
and
forward
to
show
him
off
to
a
couple
of
gentlemen
who
were
bargaining
for
the
horse
and
one
of
whom
finally
purchased
him
these
were
two
of
our
and
the
horse
was
that
on
which
the
farmer
had
pranced
in
the
here
is
a
turn
of
things
distress
pressing
distress
dread
of
the
bailiffs
alone
could
have
made
the
farmer
sell
his
horse
if
he
had
the
firmness
to
keep
the
tears
out
of
his
eyes
his
heart
must
have
paid
the
penalty
what
then
must
have
been
his
feelings
if
he
reflected
as
i
did
that
the
for
the
horse
had
first
gone
from
his
pocket
into
that
of
the
and
further
that
the
horse
had
pranced
about
for
years
for
the
purpose
of
subduing
all
opposition
to
those
very
measures
which
had
finally
dismounted
the
owner
from
this
dismal
scene
a
scene
formerly
so
joyous
we
set
off
back
to
uphusband
pretty
early
were
overtaken
by
the
rain
and
got
a
pretty
good
soaking
the
land
along
here
is
very
good
this
whole
country
has
a
chalk
bottom
but
in
the
valley
on
the
right
of
the
hill
over
which
you
go
from
andover
to
weyhill
the
chalk
lies
far
from
the
top
and
the
soil
has
few
flints
in
it
it
is
very
much
like
the
land
about
malden
and
maidstone
met
with
a
farmer
who
said
he
must
be
ruined
unless
another
good
war
should
come
this
is
no
uncommon
notion
they
saw
high
prices
war
and
they
thought
that
the
war
was
the
to
of
the
fair
was
too
dismal
for
me
to
go
to
it
again
my
sons
went
two
of
the
days
and
their
account
of
the
was
enough
to
make
one
gloomy
for
a
month
particularly
as
my
townsmen
of
farnham
were
in
this
case
amongst
the
sufferers
on
the
i
went
to
dine
with
and
to
harangue
the
farmers
at
andover
great
attention
was
paid
to
what
i
had
to
say
the
crowding
to
get
into
the
room
was
a
proof
of
nothing
perhaps
but
but
there
must
have
been
a
for
the
curiosity
and
that
cause
would
under
the
present
circumstances
be
matter
for
reflection
with
a
wise
government
went
to
newbury
to
dine
with
and
to
harangue
the
farmers
it
was
a
it
rained
so
hard
that
i
had
to
stop
at
burghclere
to
dry
my
clothes
and
to
borrow
a
great
coat
to
keep
me
dry
for
the
rest
of
the
way
so
as
not
to
have
to
sit
in
wet
clothes
at
newbury
the
company
was
not
less
attentive
or
less
numerous
than
at
andover
some
one
of
the
crew
had
i
understand
called
me
an
incendiary
the
day
is
passed
for
those
tricks
they
deceive
no
longer
here
at
newbury
i
took
occasion
to
notice
the
base
accusation
of
the
member
for
the
county
i
stated
it
as
something
that
i
had
heard
of
and
i
was
proceeding
to
charge
him
conditionally
when
tubb
of
shillingford
rose
from
his
seat
and
said
i
myself
sir
heard
him
say
the
words
i
had
heard
of
his
vile
conduct
long
before
but
i
abstained
from
charging
him
with
it
till
an
opportunity
should
offer
for
doing
it
in
his
own
country
after
the
dinner
was
over
i
went
back
to
burghclere
to
at
burghclere
one
half
the
time
writing
and
the
other
half
went
back
to
uphusband
went
to
dine
with
the
farmers
at
salisbury
and
got
back
to
uphusband
by
ten
at
night
two
hours
later
than
i
have
been
out
of
bed
for
a
great
many
months
in
quitting
andover
to
go
to
salisbury
miles
from
each
other
you
cross
the
beautiful
valley
that
goes
winding
down
amongst
the
hills
to
stockbridge
you
then
rise
into
the
open
country
that
very
soon
becomes
a
part
of
that
large
tract
of
downs
called
salisbury
plain
you
are
not
in
wiltshire
however
till
you
are
about
half
the
way
to
salisbury
you
leave
tidworth
away
to
your
right
this
is
the
seat
of
asheton
smith
and
the
fine
that
i
once
saw
there
i
should
have
called
to
recollection
with
pleasure
if
i
could
have
forgotten
the
hanging
of
the
men
at
winchester
last
spring
for
resisting
one
of
this
this
smith
son
and
a
sir
john
pollen
are
the
members
for
andover
they
are
chosen
by
the
corporation
one
of
the
corporation
an
attorney
named
etwall
is
a
commissioner
of
the
lottery
or
something
in
that
way
it
would
be
a
curious
thing
to
ascertain
how
large
a
portion
of
the
public
services
is
performed
by
the
voters
in
boroughs
and
their
relations
these
persons
are
singularly
kind
to
the
nation
they
not
only
choose
a
large
part
of
the
representatives
of
the
people
but
they
come
in
person
or
by
deputy
and
perform
a
very
considerable
part
of
the
i
should
like
to
know
how
many
of
them
are
employed
about
the
for
instance
a
list
of
these
persons
might
be
produced
to
show
the
of
the
boroughs
before
you
get
to
salisbury
you
cross
the
valley
that
brings
down
a
little
river
from
amesbury
it
is
a
very
beautiful
valley
there
is
a
chain
of
farmhouses
and
little
churches
all
the
way
up
it
the
farms
consist
of
the
land
on
the
flats
on
each
side
of
the
river
running
out
to
a
greater
or
less
extent
at
different
places
towards
the
hills
and
downs
not
far
above
amesbury
is
a
little
village
called
netherhaven
where
i
once
saw
an
of
we
were
coursing
at
everly
a
few
miles
off
and
one
of
the
party
happening
to
say
that
he
had
seen
an
acre
of
hares
at
hicks
beech
at
netherhaven
we
who
wanted
to
see
the
same
or
to
detect
our
informant
sent
a
messenger
to
beg
a
day
coursing
which
being
granted
we
went
over
the
next
day
beech
received
us
very
politely
he
took
us
into
a
wheat
stubble
close
by
his
paddock
his
son
took
a
gallop
round
cracking
his
whip
at
the
same
time
the
hares
which
were
very
thickly
in
sight
before
started
all
over
the
field
ran
into
a
like
sheep
and
we
all
agreed
that
the
flock
did
cover
acre
of
beech
had
an
old
greyhound
that
i
saw
lying
down
in
the
shrubbery
close
by
the
house
while
several
hares
were
sitting
and
skipping
about
with
just
as
much
confidence
as
cats
sit
by
a
dog
in
a
kitchen
or
a
parlour
was
this
in
either
dog
or
hares
then
mind
this
same
greyhound
went
amongst
the
rest
to
course
with
us
out
upon
the
distant
hills
and
lands
and
then
he
ran
as
eagerly
as
the
rest
and
killed
the
hares
with
as
little
remorse
philosophers
will
talk
a
long
while
before
they
will
make
men
believe
that
this
was
i
believe
that
this
dog
had
much
more
reason
than
half
of
the
cossacks
have
and
i
am
sure
he
had
a
great
deal
more
than
many
a
negro
that
i
have
seen
in
crossing
this
valley
to
go
to
salisbury
i
thought
of
hares
but
i
really
have
neither
thought
of
nor
seen
any
with
pleasure
since
the
hanging
of
the
two
men
at
winchester
if
no
other
man
will
petition
for
the
repeal
of
the
law
under
which
those
poor
fellows
suffered
i
will
but
let
us
hope
that
there
will
be
no
need
of
petitioning
let
us
hope
that
it
will
be
repealed
without
any
express
application
for
it
it
is
curious
enough
that
laws
of
this
sort
should
while
james
is
so
resolutely
bent
on
the
criminal
the
company
at
salisbury
was
very
numerous
not
less
than
farmers
were
present
they
were
very
attentive
to
what
i
said
and
which
rather
surprised
me
they
received
very
docilely
what
i
said
against
squeezing
the
labourers
a
fire
in
a
farmyard
had
lately
taken
place
near
salisbury
so
that
the
subject
was
a
ticklish
one
but
it
was
my
very
first
duty
to
treat
of
it
and
i
was
resolved
be
the
consequence
what
it
might
not
to
neglect
that
duty
to
at
uphusband
at
this
village
which
is
a
great
thoroughfare
for
sheep
and
pigs
from
wiltshire
and
dorsetshire
to
berkshire
oxfordshire
and
away
to
the
north
and
north
east
we
see
many
farmers
from
different
parts
of
the
country
and
if
i
had
had
any
doubts
before
as
to
the
deplorableness
of
their
state
those
would
now
no
longer
exist
i
did
indeed
years
ago
prove
that
if
we
returned
to
cash
payments
without
a
reduction
of
the
debt
and
without
a
rectifying
of
contracts
the
present
race
of
farmers
must
be
ruined
but
still
when
the
thing
actually
comes
it
astounds
one
it
is
like
the
death
of
a
friend
or
relation
we
talk
of
its
approach
without
much
emotion
we
foretell
the
without
much
seeming
pain
we
know
it
but
when
it
comes
we
forget
our
foretellings
and
feel
the
calamity
as
acutely
as
if
we
had
never
expected
it
the
accounts
we
hear
daily
and
almost
hourly
of
the
families
of
farmers
actually
coming
to
the
are
enough
to
make
any
body
but
a
boroughmonger
feel
that
species
of
monster
is
to
be
moved
by
nothing
but
his
own
pecuniary
sufferings
and
thank
god
the
monster
is
now
about
to
be
i
hear
from
all
parts
that
the
parsons
are
in
great
alarm
well
they
may
if
their
hearts
be
too
much
set
upon
the
treasures
of
this
world
for
i
can
see
no
possible
way
of
settling
this
matter
justly
without
resorting
to
their
temporalities
they
have
long
enough
been
calling
upon
all
the
industrious
classes
for
sacrifices
for
the
good
of
the
country
the
time
seems
to
be
come
for
them
to
do
something
in
this
way
themselves
in
a
short
time
there
will
be
because
there
can
be
no
rents
and
we
shall
see
whether
the
landlords
will
then
suffer
the
parsons
to
continue
to
receive
a
tenth
part
of
the
produce
of
the
land
in
many
places
the
farmers
have
had
the
sense
and
the
spirit
to
the
tithes
to
the
this
they
to
do
in
all
cases
whether
the
tithes
be
taken
up
in
kind
or
not
this
however
sweats
the
hat
gentleman
it
bothers
his
wig
he
does
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
he
does
not
know
to
and
where
a
parson
finds
things
not
to
his
mind
the
first
thing
he
always
does
is
to
look
about
for
somebody
to
accuse
of
sedition
and
blasphemy
lawyers
always
begin
in
such
cases
to
hunt
the
books
to
see
if
there
be
no
to
apply
but
the
devil
of
it
is
neither
of
them
have
now
any
body
to
lay
on
upon
i
always
told
them
that
there
would
arise
an
enemy
that
would
laugh
at
all
their
anathemas
informations
dungeons
halters
and
bayonets
one
positive
good
has
however
arisen
out
of
the
present
calamities
and
that
is
the
are
grown
more
than
they
were
cheap
corn
and
a
good
thumping
debt
have
greatly
conduced
to
the
producing
of
the
christian
virtue
necessary
in
us
all
but
doubly
necessary
in
the
priesthood
the
parson
is
now
one
of
the
parties
who
is
taking
away
the
landlord
estate
and
the
capital
when
the
farmer
capital
is
gone
there
will
be
no
rents
but
without
a
law
upon
the
subject
the
parson
will
still
have
his
tithe
and
a
tithe
upon
the
too
which
the
land
has
to
bear
will
the
landlords
stand
this
no
matter
if
there
be
no
reform
of
the
parliament
they
must
stand
it
the
two
sets
may
for
aught
i
care
worry
each
other
as
long
as
they
please
when
the
present
race
of
farmers
are
gone
and
that
will
soon
be
the
landlord
and
the
parson
may
settle
the
matter
between
them
they
will
be
the
only
parties
interested
and
which
of
them
shall
devour
the
other
appears
to
be
of
little
consequence
to
the
rest
of
the
community
they
agreed
most
cordially
in
creating
the
debt
they
went
hand
in
hand
in
all
the
measures
against
the
reformers
they
have
made
actually
made
the
very
thing
that
now
frightens
them
which
now
menaces
them
with
they
can
not
think
it
unjust
if
their
prayers
be
now
treated
as
the
prayers
of
the
reformers
were
to
at
burghclere
very
nasty
weather
on
the
the
came
to
throw
off
at
in
this
parish
having
heard
that
would
be
out
with
the
hounds
i
rode
to
the
place
of
meeting
in
order
to
look
him
in
the
face
and
to
give
him
an
opportunity
to
notice
on
his
own
peculiar
dunghill
what
i
had
said
of
him
at
newbury
he
came
i
rode
up
to
him
and
about
him
but
he
said
not
a
word
the
company
entered
the
wood
and
i
rode
back
towards
my
quarters
they
found
a
fox
and
quickly
lost
him
then
they
came
out
of
the
wood
and
came
back
along
the
road
and
met
me
and
passed
me
they
as
well
as
i
going
at
a
foot
pace
i
had
plenty
of
time
to
survey
them
all
well
and
to
mark
their
looks
i
watched
dundas
eyes
but
the
devil
a
bit
could
i
get
them
to
turn
he
is
for
the
present
we
shall
see
whether
he
will
go
or
send
an
ambassador
or
neither
when
i
shall
be
at
reading
on
the
of
next
month
set
off
for
london
went
by
alderbridge
crookham
brimton
mortimer
strathfield
say
heckfield
heath
eversley
blackwater
and
slept
at
oakingham
this
is
with
trifling
exceptions
a
miserably
poor
country
burghclere
lies
along
at
the
foot
of
a
part
of
that
chain
of
hills
which
in
this
part
divide
hampshire
from
berkshire
the
parish
just
named
is
indeed
in
hampshire
but
it
forms
merely
the
foot
of
the
highclere
and
kingsclere
hills
these
hills
from
which
you
can
see
all
across
the
country
even
to
the
isle
of
wight
are
of
chalk
and
with
them
towards
the
north
ends
the
chalk
the
soil
over
which
i
have
come
is
generally
a
stony
sand
upon
a
bed
of
gravel
with
the
exception
of
the
land
just
round
crookham
and
the
other
villages
nothing
can
well
be
poorer
or
more
villanously
ugly
it
is
all
first
cousin
to
hounslow
heath
of
which
it
is
in
fact
a
continuation
to
the
westward
there
is
a
clay
at
the
bottom
of
the
gravel
so
that
you
have
here
nasty
stagnant
pools
without
fertility
of
soil
the
rushes
grow
amongst
the
gravel
sure
sign
that
there
is
clay
beneath
to
hold
the
water
for
unless
there
be
water
constantly
at
their
roots
rushes
will
not
grow
such
land
is
however
good
for
wherever
there
is
soil
enough
on
the
top
of
the
gravel
for
the
oak
to
get
hold
and
to
send
its
down
to
the
clay
the
oak
is
the
thing
to
plant
here
and
this
whole
country
contains
not
one
single
plantation
of
oaks
that
is
to
say
as
far
as
i
observed
plenty
of
and
other
rubbish
have
been
recently
planted
but
no
oaks
at
is
that
everlasting
monument
of
english
wisdom
collective
the
loom
of
the
captain
of
the
in
his
peerage
it
is
said
that
it
was
wholly
out
of
the
power
of
the
nation
to
reward
his
services
fully
but
that
she
did
what
she
could
well
poor
devil
and
what
could
any
body
ask
for
more
it
was
well
however
that
she
give
what
she
did
while
she
was
drunk
for
if
she
had
held
her
hand
till
now
i
am
half
disposed
to
think
that
her
gifts
would
have
been
very
small
i
can
never
forget
that
we
have
to
pay
interest
on
of
the
money
merely
owing
to
the
coxcombery
of
the
late
whitbread
who
actually
moved
that
to
one
of
the
grants
proposed
by
the
ministers
now
a
great
part
of
the
grants
is
in
the
way
of
annuity
or
pension
it
is
notorious
that
when
the
grants
were
made
the
pensions
would
not
purchase
more
than
a
third
part
of
as
much
wheat
as
they
will
now
the
grants
therefore
have
been
augmented
threefold
what
right
then
has
any
one
to
say
that
the
ought
to
fall
unless
he
say
that
these
pensions
ought
to
be
reduced
the
hampshire
magistrates
when
they
were
putting
forth
their
about
the
allowances
to
labourers
should
have
noticed
these
pensions
of
the
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
however
real
starvation
can
not
be
inflicted
to
any
very
great
extent
the
present
race
of
farmers
must
give
way
and
the
attempts
to
squeeze
rents
out
of
the
wages
of
labour
must
cease
and
the
matter
will
finally
rest
to
be
settled
by
the
landlords
parsons
and
if
the
landlords
choose
to
give
the
greatest
captain
three
times
as
much
as
was
granted
to
him
why
let
him
have
it
according
to
all
account
he
is
no
at
any
rate
and
the
estates
that
pass
through
his
hands
may
perhaps
be
full
as
well
disposed
of
as
they
are
at
present
considering
the
miserable
soil
i
have
passed
over
i
am
rather
surprised
to
find
oakingham
so
decent
a
town
it
has
a
very
handsome
and
is
by
no
means
an
ugly
set
off
at
daylight
and
got
to
kensington
about
noon
on
leaving
oakingham
for
london
you
get
upon
what
is
called
that
is
to
say
upon
as
bleak
as
barren
and
as
villanous
a
heath
as
ever
man
set
his
eyes
on
however
here
are
new
enclosures
without
end
and
here
are
houses
too
here
and
there
over
the
whole
of
this
execrable
tract
of
country
what
canning
will
say
will
you
not
allow
that
the
owners
of
these
new
enclosures
and
these
houses
know
their
own
interests
and
are
not
these
and
are
they
not
a
proof
of
an
addition
to
the
national
capital
to
the
first
i
answer
be
to
the
two
last
these
new
enclosures
and
houses
arise
out
of
the
beggaring
of
the
parts
of
the
country
distant
from
the
vortex
of
the
funds
the
farmhouses
have
long
been
growing
fewer
and
fewer
the
labourers
houses
fewer
and
fewer
and
it
is
manifest
to
every
man
who
has
eyes
to
see
with
that
the
villages
are
regularly
wasting
away
this
is
the
case
all
over
the
parts
of
the
kingdom
where
the
do
not
haunt
in
all
the
really
agricultural
villages
and
parts
of
the
kingdom
there
is
a
a
great
dilapidation
and
constant
pulling
down
or
falling
down
of
houses
the
farmhouses
are
not
so
many
as
they
were
forty
years
ago
by
that
is
to
say
the
infernal
system
of
pitt
and
his
followers
has
annihilated
three
parts
out
of
four
of
the
farm
houses
the
labourers
houses
disappear
also
and
all
the
people
become
less
numerous
while
these
spewy
sands
and
gravel
near
london
are
enclosed
and
built
on
good
lands
in
other
parts
are
neglected
these
enclosures
and
buildings
are
a
they
are
means
they
are
a
proof
of
national
decline
and
not
of
prosperity
to
cultivate
and
ornament
these
villanous
spots
the
produce
and
the
population
are
drawn
away
from
the
good
lands
there
all
manner
of
schemes
have
been
resorted
to
to
get
rid
of
the
necessity
of
and
i
am
quite
convinced
that
the
population
upon
the
whole
has
not
increased
in
england
one
single
soul
since
i
was
born
an
opinion
that
i
have
often
expressed
in
support
of
which
i
have
as
often
offered
arguments
and
those
arguments
have
been
as
to
this
rascally
heath
that
which
has
ornamented
it
has
brought
misery
on
millions
the
spot
is
not
far
distant
from
the
crew
the
roads
to
it
are
level
they
are
smooth
the
wretches
can
go
to
it
from
the
without
any
danger
to
their
worthless
necks
and
thus
it
is
improved
a
set
of
men
who
can
look
upon
this
as
improvement
who
can
regard
this
as
a
proof
of
the
increased
capital
of
the
country
are
pretty
fit
it
must
be
allowed
to
get
the
country
out
of
its
present
difficulties
at
the
end
of
this
blackguard
heath
you
come
on
the
road
to
egham
to
a
little
place
called
which
is
on
the
western
side
of
windsor
park
it
is
a
spot
all
made
into
grounds
and
gardens
by
the
inhabitants
of
it
have
beggared
twenty
agricultural
villages
and
hamlets
from
this
place
you
go
across
a
corner
of
windsor
park
and
come
out
at
virginia
water
to
egham
is
then
about
two
miles
a
much
more
ugly
country
than
that
between
egham
and
kensington
would
with
great
difficulty
be
found
in
england
flat
as
a
pancake
and
until
you
come
to
hammersmith
the
soil
is
a
nasty
stony
dirt
upon
a
bed
of
gravel
which
is
only
a
little
worse
than
the
general
run
is
a
sample
of
all
that
is
bad
in
soil
and
villanous
in
look
yet
this
is
now
enclosed
and
what
they
call
cultivated
here
is
a
fresh
robbery
of
villages
hamlets
and
farm
and
labourers
buildings
and
abodes
but
here
is
one
of
those
improvements
called
what
an
improvement
what
an
addition
to
the
national
capital
for
mind
monsieur
de
snip
the
surrey
norman
actually
said
that
the
new
buildings
ought
to
be
reckoned
an
addition
to
the
national
capital
what
snip
do
you
pretend
that
the
nation
is
because
the
means
of
making
this
barrack
have
been
drawn
away
from
the
people
in
taxes
mind
monsieur
le
normand
the
barrack
did
not
drop
down
from
the
sky
nor
spring
up
out
of
the
earth
it
was
not
created
by
the
unhanged
knaves
of
it
came
out
of
the
people
labour
and
when
you
hear
ellman
tell
the
committee
of
that
years
ago
every
man
in
his
parish
brewed
his
own
beer
and
that
now
not
one
man
in
that
same
parish
does
it
when
you
hear
this
monsieur
de
snip
you
might
if
you
had
brains
in
your
skull
be
able
to
estimate
the
effects
of
what
has
produced
the
barrack
yet
barracks
there
must
be
or
and
must
fall
and
the
fall
of
these
would
break
poor
canning
heart
from
london
to
egham
in
the
evening
started
at
in
a
hazy
frost
for
reading
the
horses
manes
and
ears
covered
with
the
hoar
before
we
got
across
windsor
park
which
appeared
to
be
a
blackguard
soil
pretty
much
like
hounslow
heath
only
not
flat
a
very
large
part
of
the
park
is
covered
with
heath
or
rushes
sure
sign
of
execrable
soil
but
the
roads
are
such
as
might
have
been
made
by
solomon
a
greater
than
solomon
is
here
some
one
may
exclaim
of
that
i
know
nothing
i
am
but
a
traveller
and
the
roads
in
this
park
are
beautiful
indeed
my
servant
whom
i
brought
from
amongst
the
hills
and
flints
of
uphusband
must
certainly
have
thought
himself
in
paradise
as
he
was
going
through
the
park
if
i
had
told
him
that
the
buildings
and
the
labourers
clothes
and
meals
at
uphusband
were
the
for
those
pretty
roads
with
edgings
cut
to
the
line
he
would
have
wondered
at
me
i
dare
say
it
would
nevertheless
have
been
perfectly
true
and
this
is
of
a
much
more
useful
sort
than
that
which
is
taught
by
the
edinburgh
reviewers
when
you
get
through
the
park
you
come
to
winkfield
and
then
bound
for
reading
you
go
through
binfield
which
is
ten
miles
from
egham
and
as
many
from
reading
at
binfield
i
stopped
to
breakfast
at
a
very
nice
country
inn
called
the
and
here
you
go
along
on
the
north
border
of
that
villanous
tract
of
country
that
i
passed
over
in
going
from
oakingham
to
egham
much
of
the
land
even
here
is
but
newly
enclosed
and
it
was
really
not
worth
a
straw
before
it
was
loaded
with
the
fruit
of
the
labour
of
the
people
living
in
the
parts
of
the
country
distant
from
the
what
injustice
what
unnatural
changes
such
things
can
not
be
without
producing
convulsion
in
the
end
a
road
as
smooth
as
a
die
a
real
road
brought
us
to
reading
by
eleven
we
dined
at
one
and
very
much
pleased
i
was
with
the
company
i
have
seldom
seen
a
number
of
persons
assembled
together
whose
approbation
i
valued
more
than
that
of
the
company
of
this
day
last
year
the
prime
minister
said
that
his
speech
the
grand
speech
was
rendered
necessary
by
the
pains
that
had
been
taken
in
different
parts
of
the
country
to
persuade
the
farmers
that
the
distress
had
arisen
out
of
the
of
the
and
from
to
be
sure
i
had
taken
some
pains
to
remove
that
stupid
notion
about
from
the
minds
of
the
farmers
but
did
the
in
counteracting
the
effect
of
my
efforts
not
he
indeed
and
after
his
speech
was
made
and
sent
forth
cheek
by
jowl
with
that
of
the
sane
castlereagh
of
memory
the
truths
inculcated
by
me
were
only
the
more
manifest
this
has
been
a
fine
meeting
at
reading
i
feel
very
proud
of
it
the
morning
was
fine
for
me
to
ride
in
and
the
rain
began
as
soon
as
i
was
housed
i
came
on
miles
slept
on
the
road
and
finished
my
harangue
at
the
end
of
from
leaving
kensington
and
i
can
not
help
saying
that
is
pretty
well
for
cobbett
i
am
delighted
with
the
people
that
i
have
seen
at
reading
their
kindness
to
me
is
nothing
in
my
estimation
compared
with
the
sense
and
spirit
which
they
appear
to
possess
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
things
have
with
me
that
combination
that
sort
of
union
which
has
existed
for
so
many
years
amongst
all
the
parties
to
me
generally
and
particularly
as
the
called
it
to
keep
me
out
of
parliament
any
this
combination
has
led
to
the
present
system
which
in
some
sort
supplies
the
place
of
a
seat
in
parliament
it
may
be
said
indeed
that
i
have
not
the
honour
to
sit
in
the
same
room
with
those
great
reformers
lord
john
russell
sir
massey
lopez
and
his
guest
sir
francis
burdett
but
happiness
here
below
is
never
perfect
and
there
may
be
besides
people
to
believe
that
a
man
ought
not
to
break
his
heart
on
account
of
being
shut
out
of
such
company
especially
when
he
can
find
such
company
as
i
have
this
day
found
at
reading
went
from
reading
through
aldermaston
for
burghclere
the
rain
has
been
very
heavy
and
the
water
was
a
good
deal
out
here
on
my
way
i
got
upon
crookham
common
again
which
is
a
sort
of
continuation
of
the
wretched
country
about
oakingham
from
highclere
i
looked
one
day
over
the
flat
towards
marlborough
and
i
there
saw
some
such
rascally
heaths
so
that
this
villanous
tract
extends
from
east
to
west
with
more
or
less
of
exceptions
from
hounslow
to
hungerford
from
north
to
south
it
extends
from
binfield
which
can
not
be
far
from
the
borders
of
buckinghamshire
to
the
south
downs
of
hampshire
and
terminates
somewhere
between
liphook
and
petersfield
after
stretching
over
hindhead
which
is
certainly
the
most
villanous
spot
that
god
ever
made
our
ancestors
do
indeed
seem
to
have
ascribed
its
formation
to
another
power
for
the
most
celebrated
part
of
it
is
called
devil
punch
in
this
tract
of
country
there
are
certainly
some
very
beautiful
spots
but
these
are
very
few
in
number
except
where
the
run
into
the
tract
the
neighbourhood
of
godalming
ought
hardly
to
be
considered
as
an
exception
for
there
you
are
just
on
the
outside
of
the
tract
and
begin
to
enter
on
the
that
is
to
say
clayey
woodlands
all
the
part
of
berkshire
of
which
i
have
been
recently
passing
over
if
i
except
the
tract
from
reading
to
crookham
is
very
bad
land
and
a
very
ugly
country
uphusband
and
for
the
sixth
time
this
year
over
the
north
hampshire
hills
which
notwithstanding
their
everlasting
flints
i
like
very
much
as
you
ride
along
even
in
a
the
horses
feet
make
a
noise
like
it
seems
as
if
you
were
riding
on
a
mass
of
iron
yet
the
soil
is
good
and
bears
some
of
the
best
wheat
in
england
all
these
high
and
indeed
all
chalky
lands
are
excellent
for
sheep
but
on
the
top
of
some
of
these
hills
there
are
as
fine
meadows
as
i
ever
saw
pasture
richer
perhaps
than
that
about
swindon
in
the
north
of
wiltshire
and
the
singularity
is
that
this
pasture
is
on
the
of
these
lofty
hills
from
which
you
can
see
the
isle
of
wight
there
is
a
stiff
loam
in
some
places
twenty
feet
deep
on
a
bottom
of
chalk
though
the
grass
grows
so
finely
there
is
no
apparent
wetness
in
the
land
the
wells
are
more
than
three
hundred
feet
deep
the
main
part
of
the
water
for
all
uses
comes
from
the
clouds
and
indeed
these
are
pretty
constant
companions
of
these
chalk
hills
which
are
very
often
enveloped
in
clouds
and
wet
when
it
is
sunshine
down
at
burghclere
or
uphusband
they
manure
the
land
here
by
digging
in
the
fields
and
bringing
up
the
chalk
which
they
spread
about
on
the
land
and
which
being
is
reduced
to
powder
by
the
frosts
a
considerable
portion
of
the
land
is
covered
with
wood
and
as
in
the
clearing
of
the
land
the
clearers
followed
the
good
soil
without
regard
to
shape
of
fields
the
forms
of
the
woods
are
of
endless
variety
which
added
to
the
inequalities
of
the
surface
of
the
whole
makes
this
like
all
the
others
of
the
same
description
a
very
pleasant
country
set
off
from
uphusband
for
hambledon
the
first
place
i
had
to
get
to
was
whitchurch
on
my
way
and
at
a
short
distance
from
uphusband
down
the
valley
i
went
through
a
village
called
which
takes
its
name
from
the
water
that
runs
down
this
valley
a
in
the
language
of
our
forefathers
seems
to
be
a
river
which
is
part
of
the
year
there
is
one
of
these
bourns
down
this
pretty
valley
it
has
generally
no
water
till
towards
spring
and
then
it
runs
for
several
months
it
is
the
same
at
the
candovers
as
you
go
across
the
downs
from
odiham
to
winchester
the
little
village
of
therefore
takes
its
name
from
its
situation
then
there
are
two
one
above
and
one
below
this
village
of
bourn
means
i
believe
a
forest
there
were
doubtless
one
of
those
on
each
side
of
bourn
and
when
they
became
villages
the
one
above
was
called
and
the
one
below
which
names
have
become
and
the
lawyers
therefore
who
to
the
immortal
honour
of
and
norman
descent
are
making
such
a
pretty
story
out
for
the
lord
chancellor
relative
to
a
noble
peer
who
voted
for
the
bill
against
the
queen
ought
to
leave
off
calling
the
seat
of
the
noble
person
for
it
is
at
downhurstbourn
where
he
lives
and
where
he
was
visited
by
bankhead
whitchurch
is
a
small
town
but
famous
for
being
the
place
where
the
paper
has
been
made
for
the
i
passed
by
the
on
my
way
out
to
get
upon
the
downs
to
go
to
alresford
where
i
intended
to
sleep
i
hope
the
time
will
come
when
a
monument
will
be
erected
where
that
mill
stands
and
when
on
that
monument
will
be
inscribed
curse
of
this
spot
ought
to
be
held
accursed
in
all
time
henceforth
and
for
evermore
it
has
been
the
spot
from
which
have
sprung
more
and
greater
mischiefs
than
ever
plagued
mankind
before
however
the
evils
now
appear
to
be
fast
recoiling
on
the
merciless
authors
of
them
and
therefore
one
beholds
this
scene
of
with
a
less
degree
of
rage
than
formerly
my
blood
used
to
boil
when
i
thought
of
the
wretches
who
carried
on
and
supported
the
system
it
does
not
boil
now
when
i
think
of
them
the
curse
which
they
intended
solely
for
others
is
now
falling
on
themselves
and
i
smile
at
their
sufferings
blasphemy
atheism
who
can
be
an
atheist
that
sees
how
these
wretches
are
treated
with
what
exact
measure
they
are
receiving
the
evils
which
they
inflicted
on
others
for
a
time
and
which
they
intended
to
inflict
on
them
for
ever
if
indeed
the
monsters
had
continued
to
prosper
one
might
have
been
an
atheist
the
true
history
of
the
rise
progress
and
fall
of
these
monsters
of
their
their
and
their
will
do
more
than
has
been
done
before
to
put
an
end
to
the
doubts
of
those
who
have
doubts
upon
this
subject
quitting
whitchurch
i
went
off
to
the
left
out
of
the
got
out
upon
the
took
an
observation
as
the
sailors
call
it
and
off
i
rode
in
a
straight
line
over
hedge
and
ditch
towards
the
rising
ground
between
stratton
park
and
but
before
i
reached
this
point
i
found
some
wet
meadows
and
some
running
water
in
my
way
in
a
little
valley
running
up
from
the
turnpike
road
to
a
little
place
called
i
therefore
turned
to
my
left
went
down
to
the
turnpike
went
a
little
way
along
it
then
turned
to
my
left
went
along
by
stratton
park
pales
down
east
and
then
on
towards
the
grange
park
stratton
park
is
the
seat
of
sir
thomas
baring
who
has
here
several
thousands
of
acres
of
land
who
has
the
living
of
micheldever
to
which
i
think
northington
and
swallowfield
are
joined
above
all
he
has
micheldever
wood
which
they
say
contains
a
thousand
acres
and
which
is
one
of
the
finest
in
england
this
large
and
very
beautiful
estate
must
have
belonged
to
the
church
at
the
time
of
henry
the
eighth
it
was
i
believe
given
by
him
to
the
family
of
and
it
was
by
them
sold
to
sir
francis
baring
about
twenty
years
ago
upon
the
whole
all
things
considered
the
change
is
for
the
better
sir
thomas
baring
would
not
have
moved
nay
he
move
for
the
pardon
of
while
he
left
joseph
swann
in
gaol
for
years
and
a
without
so
much
as
hinting
at
swann
case
yea
verily
i
would
rather
see
this
estate
in
the
hands
of
sir
thomas
baring
than
in
those
of
friend
besides
it
seems
to
be
acknowledged
that
any
title
is
as
good
as
those
derived
from
the
old
castlereagh
when
the
whigs
talked
in
a
rather
rude
manner
about
the
sinecure
places
and
pensions
told
them
that
the
title
of
the
sinecure
man
or
woman
was
good
as
the
titles
of
the
duke
of
this
was
to
the
sure
for
had
begun
it
he
called
the
duke
the
of
and
seemed
to
hint
at
the
propriety
of
them
a
little
when
the
men
of
kent
petitioned
for
a
reduction
of
the
national
debt
lord
john
russell
with
that
wisdom
for
which
he
is
renowned
reprobated
the
prayer
but
having
done
this
in
terms
not
sufficiently
unqualified
and
strong
and
having
made
use
of
a
word
of
equivocal
meaning
the
man
that
cut
his
own
throat
at
north
cray
pitched
on
upon
him
and
told
him
that
the
fundholder
had
as
much
right
to
his
dividends
as
duke
of
bedford
had
to
his
upon
this
the
noble
reformer
and
advocate
for
lopez
mended
his
expressions
and
really
said
what
the
north
cray
philosopher
said
he
ought
to
say
come
come
micheldever
wood
is
in
very
proper
hands
a
little
girl
of
whom
i
asked
my
way
down
into
east
stratton
and
who
was
dressed
in
a
camlet
gown
white
apron
and
plaid
cloak
it
was
sunday
and
who
had
a
book
in
her
hand
told
me
that
lady
baring
gave
her
the
clothes
and
had
her
taught
to
read
and
to
sing
hymns
and
spiritual
songs
as
i
came
through
the
strattons
i
saw
not
less
than
a
dozen
girls
clad
in
this
same
way
it
is
impossible
not
to
believe
that
this
is
done
with
a
good
motive
but
it
is
possible
not
to
believe
that
it
is
productive
of
good
it
must
create
hypocrites
and
hypocrisy
is
the
great
sin
of
the
age
society
is
in
a
state
when
the
rich
think
that
they
must
the
poor
in
order
to
insure
their
for
this
at
bottom
is
the
great
motive
now
at
work
in
pushing
on
the
education
scheme
though
in
this
particular
case
perhaps
there
may
be
a
little
enthusiasm
at
work
when
persons
are
glutted
with
riches
when
they
have
their
fill
of
them
when
they
are
surfeited
of
all
earthly
pursuits
they
are
very
apt
to
begin
to
think
about
the
next
world
and
the
moment
they
begin
to
think
of
that
they
begin
to
look
over
the
that
they
shall
have
to
present
hence
the
far
greater
part
of
what
are
called
charities
but
it
is
the
business
of
to
take
care
that
there
shall
be
very
little
of
this
with
riches
and
very
little
need
of
charities
from
stratton
i
went
on
to
northington
down
then
round
to
the
south
of
the
grange
park
alex
baring
down
to
abbotson
and
over
some
pretty
little
green
hills
to
alresford
which
is
a
nice
little
town
of
itself
but
which
presents
a
singularly
beautiful
view
from
the
last
little
hill
coming
from
abbotson
i
could
not
pass
by
the
grange
park
without
thinking
of
and
lady
henry
whose
lives
and
deaths
surpassed
what
we
read
of
in
the
most
sentimental
romances
very
few
things
that
i
have
met
with
in
my
life
ever
filled
me
with
sorrow
equal
to
that
which
i
felt
at
the
death
of
this
most
virtuous
and
most
amiable
pair
it
began
raining
soon
after
i
got
to
alresford
and
rained
all
the
evening
i
heard
here
that
a
requisition
for
a
county
meeting
was
in
the
course
of
being
signed
in
different
parts
of
the
county
they
mean
to
petition
for
reform
i
hope
at
any
rate
i
intend
to
go
to
see
what
they
do
i
saw
the
at
the
county
meeting
in
i
should
like
of
all
things
to
see
them
at
another
meeting
these
are
the
persons
that
i
have
most
steadily
in
my
eye
the
war
and
the
debt
were
for
the
and
the
these
must
stand
or
fall
together
now
i
always
told
the
parsons
that
they
were
the
greatest
fools
in
the
world
to
put
the
tithes
on
board
same
with
the
boroughs
i
told
them
so
in
and
i
fancy
they
will
soon
see
all
about
it
came
from
alresford
to
hambledon
through
titchbourn
cheriton
beauworth
kilmston
and
exton
this
is
all
a
high
hard
dry
country
like
that
indeed
over
which
i
came
yesterday
at
titchbourn
there
is
a
park
and
great
house
as
the
call
it
the
place
belongs
i
believe
to
a
sir
somebody
a
family
very
likely
half
as
old
as
the
name
of
the
village
which
however
partly
takes
its
name
from
the
that
runs
down
the
valley
i
thought
as
i
was
riding
alongside
of
this
park
that
i
had
heard
of
this
family
of
titchbourne
and
i
therefore
saw
the
park
with
sorrow
there
is
not
more
than
one
pale
in
a
yard
and
those
that
remain
and
the
rails
and
posts
and
all
seem
tumbling
down
this
is
perfectly
typical
of
those
of
the
landlords
who
are
they
are
wasting
away
very
fast
the
landlords
think
to
swim
out
the
gale
they
are
deceived
they
are
deluded
by
their
own
greediness
kilmston
was
my
next
place
after
titchbourn
but
i
wanted
to
go
to
beauworth
so
that
i
had
to
go
through
cheriton
a
little
hard
iron
village
where
all
seems
to
be
as
old
as
the
hills
that
surround
it
in
coming
along
you
see
titchbourn
church
away
to
the
right
on
the
side
of
the
hill
a
very
pretty
little
view
and
this
though
such
a
hard
country
is
a
pretty
country
at
cheriton
i
found
a
grand
camp
of
just
upon
the
move
towards
alresford
i
had
met
some
of
the
scouts
first
and
afterwards
the
advanced
guard
and
here
the
main
body
was
getting
in
motion
one
of
the
scouts
that
i
met
was
a
young
woman
who
i
am
sure
was
six
feet
high
there
were
two
or
three
more
in
the
camp
of
about
the
same
height
and
some
most
strapping
fellows
of
men
it
is
curious
that
this
race
should
have
preserved
their
dark
skin
and
straight
and
coarse
hair
very
much
like
that
of
the
american
indians
i
mean
the
hair
for
the
skin
has
nothing
of
the
as
that
of
the
indians
has
it
is
not
either
of
the
mulatto
cast
that
is
to
say
there
is
no
yellow
in
it
it
is
a
black
mixed
with
our
english
colours
of
pale
or
red
and
the
features
are
small
like
those
of
the
girls
in
sussex
and
often
singularly
pretty
the
tall
girl
that
i
met
at
titchbourn
who
had
a
huckster
basket
on
her
arm
had
most
beautiful
features
i
pulled
up
my
horse
and
said
can
you
tell
me
my
fortune
my
dear
she
answered
in
the
negative
giving
me
a
look
at
the
same
time
that
seemed
to
say
it
was
and
that
if
i
had
been
thirty
years
younger
she
might
have
seen
a
little
what
she
could
do
with
me
it
is
all
circumstances
considered
truly
surprising
that
this
race
should
have
preserved
so
perfectly
all
its
distinctive
marks
i
came
on
to
beauworth
to
inquire
after
the
family
of
a
worthy
old
farmer
whom
i
knew
there
some
years
ago
and
of
whose
death
i
had
heard
at
alresford
a
bridle
road
over
some
fields
and
through
a
coppice
took
me
to
kilmston
formerly
a
large
village
but
now
mouldered
into
two
farms
and
a
few
miserable
houses
for
the
labourers
here
is
a
house
that
was
formerly
the
residence
of
the
landlord
of
the
place
but
is
now
occupied
by
one
of
the
farmers
this
is
a
fine
country
for
and
kilmston
belonged
to
a
ridge
who
was
a
famous
and
who
is
accused
of
having
spent
his
fortune
in
that
way
but
what
do
people
mean
he
had
a
right
to
spend
his
as
his
fathers
had
done
before
him
it
was
the
and
not
the
that
took
away
the
principal
the
place
now
belongs
to
a
long
whose
origin
i
can
not
find
out
from
kilmston
i
went
right
over
the
downs
to
the
top
of
a
hill
called
which
is
one
of
the
loftiest
hills
in
the
country
here
you
can
see
the
isle
of
wight
in
detail
a
fine
sweep
of
the
sea
also
away
into
sussex
and
over
the
new
forest
into
dorsetshire
just
below
you
to
the
east
you
look
down
upon
the
village
of
exton
and
you
can
see
up
this
valley
which
is
called
a
too
as
far
as
west
meon
and
down
it
as
far
as
soberton
corhampton
warnford
and
droxford
come
within
these
two
points
so
that
here
are
six
villages
on
this
bourn
within
the
space
of
about
five
miles
on
the
other
side
of
the
main
valley
down
which
the
bourn
runs
and
opposite
beacon
hill
is
another
such
a
hill
which
they
call
winchester
on
the
top
of
this
hill
there
was
once
a
camp
or
rather
fortress
and
the
ramparts
are
now
pretty
nearly
as
visible
as
ever
the
same
is
to
be
seen
on
the
beacon
hill
at
highclere
these
ramparts
had
nothing
of
the
principles
of
modern
fortification
in
their
formation
you
see
no
signs
of
salliant
angles
it
was
a
and
and
that
appears
to
have
been
all
i
had
i
think
a
full
mile
to
go
down
from
the
top
of
beacon
hill
to
exton
this
is
the
village
where
that
lives
who
as
described
by
me
in
bawled
in
lord
cochrane
ear
at
winchester
in
the
month
of
march
of
that
year
parson
lives
at
which
is
not
a
mile
further
down
so
that
this
valley
has
something
in
it
besides
picturesque
views
i
asked
some
countrymen
how
poulter
and
baines
did
but
their
answer
contained
too
much
of
for
me
to
give
it
here
at
exton
i
crossed
the
gosport
turnpike
road
came
up
the
cross
valley
under
the
south
side
of
old
winchester
hill
over
stoke
down
then
over
down
and
then
to
my
friend
house
at
in
the
parish
of
hambledon
thus
have
i
crossed
nearly
the
whole
of
this
country
from
the
to
the
without
going
five
hundred
yards
on
a
turnpike
road
and
as
nearly
as
i
could
do
it
in
a
straight
line
the
whole
country
that
i
have
crossed
is
loam
and
flints
upon
a
bottom
of
chalk
at
alresford
there
are
some
watered
meadows
which
are
the
beginning
of
a
chain
of
meadows
that
goes
all
the
way
down
to
winchester
and
hence
to
southampton
but
even
these
meadows
have
at
alresford
chalk
under
them
the
water
that
supplies
them
comes
out
of
called
alresford
pond
which
is
fed
from
the
high
hills
in
the
neighbourhood
these
counties
are
purely
agricultural
and
they
have
suffered
most
cruelly
from
the
accursed
their
hilliness
bleakness
roughness
of
roads
render
them
unpleasant
to
the
luxurious
effeminate
crew
who
never
come
near
them
and
who
have
pared
them
down
to
the
very
bone
the
villages
are
all
in
a
state
of
the
dropping
down
bit
by
bit
the
produce
is
by
a
few
great
farmers
dragged
to
a
few
spots
and
all
the
rest
is
falling
into
decay
if
this
infernal
system
could
go
on
for
forty
years
longer
it
would
make
all
the
labourers
as
much
slaves
as
the
negroes
are
and
subject
to
the
same
sort
of
discipline
and
management
to
at
west
end
hambledon
is
a
long
straggling
village
lying
in
a
little
valley
formed
by
some
very
pretty
but
not
lofty
hills
the
environs
are
much
prettier
than
the
village
itself
which
is
not
far
from
the
north
side
of
portsdown
hill
this
must
have
once
been
a
considerable
place
for
here
is
a
church
pretty
nearly
as
large
as
that
at
farnham
in
surrey
which
is
quite
sufficient
for
a
large
town
the
means
of
living
has
been
drawn
away
from
these
villages
and
the
people
follow
the
means
cheriton
and
kilmston
and
hambledon
and
the
like
have
been
beggared
for
the
purpose
of
giving
the
means
of
making
improvements
on
the
villanous
spewy
gravel
of
windsor
forest
the
thing
however
must
go
revolution
here
or
revolution
there
bawl
bellow
alarm
as
long
as
the
like
the
thing
must
go
back
indeed
is
in
some
quarters
those
scenes
of
glorious
loyalty
the
places
are
beginning
to
be
deserted
how
many
villages
has
that
scene
of
all
that
is
wicked
and
odious
portsmouth
gosport
and
portsea
how
many
villages
has
that
hellish
assemblage
beggared
it
is
now
being
scattered
houses
which
there
let
for
forty
or
fifty
pounds
each
now
let
for
three
or
four
shillings
each
and
thousands
perhaps
can
not
be
let
at
all
to
any
body
capable
of
paying
rent
there
is
an
absolute
tumbling
down
taking
place
where
so
lately
there
were
such
vast
improvements
does
monsieur
de
snip
call
those
improvements
then
does
he
insist
that
those
houses
form
an
addition
to
the
national
capital
is
it
any
wonder
that
a
country
should
be
miserable
when
such
notions
prevail
and
when
they
can
even
in
the
parliament
be
received
with
cheering
set
off
from
hambledon
to
go
to
thursley
in
surrey
about
five
miles
from
godalming
here
i
am
at
thursley
after
as
interesting
a
day
as
i
ever
spent
in
all
my
life
they
say
that
is
charming
and
this
day
i
have
had
of
scenes
and
of
soils
a
variety
indeed
to
go
to
thursley
from
hambledon
the
plain
way
was
up
the
downs
to
petersfield
and
then
along
the
through
liphook
and
over
hindhead
at
the
foot
of
which
thursley
lies
but
i
had
been
over
that
sweet
hindhead
and
had
seen
too
much
of
and
of
heath
to
think
of
taking
another
so
large
a
dose
of
them
the
map
of
hampshire
and
we
had
none
of
surrey
showed
me
the
way
to
headley
which
lies
on
the
west
of
hindhead
down
upon
the
flat
i
knew
it
was
but
about
five
miles
from
headley
to
thursley
and
i
therefore
resolved
to
go
to
headley
in
spite
of
all
the
remonstrances
of
friends
who
represented
to
me
the
danger
of
breaking
my
neck
at
hawkley
and
of
getting
buried
in
the
bogs
of
woolmer
forest
my
route
was
through
froxfield
hawkley
greatham
and
then
over
woolmer
forest
a
if
you
please
to
headley
off
we
set
over
the
downs
crossing
the
bottom
sweep
of
old
winchester
hill
from
to
we
came
down
a
long
and
steep
hill
that
led
us
winding
round
into
the
village
which
lies
in
a
valley
that
runs
in
a
direction
nearly
east
and
west
and
that
has
a
rivulet
that
comes
out
of
the
hills
towards
petersfield
if
i
had
not
seen
anything
further
i
should
have
dwelt
long
on
the
beauties
of
this
place
here
is
a
very
fine
valley
in
nearly
an
eliptical
form
sheltered
by
high
hills
sloping
gradually
from
it
and
not
far
from
the
middle
of
this
valley
there
is
a
hill
nearly
in
the
form
of
a
with
the
foot
and
stem
broken
off
and
turned
upside
down
and
this
is
clapped
down
upon
the
level
of
the
valley
just
as
you
would
put
such
goblet
upon
a
table
the
hill
is
lofty
partly
covered
with
wood
and
it
gives
an
air
of
great
singularity
to
the
scene
i
am
sure
that
has
been
a
the
church
has
a
pretty
nearly
equal
as
far
as
i
recollect
to
that
of
the
cathedral
at
winchester
the
rest
of
the
church
has
been
rebuilt
and
perhaps
several
times
but
the
is
complete
it
has
had
put
upon
it
but
it
retains
all
its
beauty
and
it
shows
that
the
church
which
is
still
large
must
at
first
have
been
a
very
large
building
let
those
who
talk
so
glibly
of
the
increase
of
the
population
in
england
go
over
the
country
from
highclere
to
hambledon
let
them
look
at
the
size
of
the
churches
and
let
them
observe
those
numerous
small
enclosures
on
every
side
of
every
village
which
had
to
a
certainty
its
in
former
times
but
let
them
go
to
and
account
for
that
church
where
did
the
hands
come
from
to
make
it
look
however
at
the
downs
the
many
square
miles
of
downs
near
this
village
all
bearing
the
of
the
and
all
out
of
tillage
for
many
many
years
yet
not
one
single
inch
of
them
but
what
is
vastly
superior
in
quality
to
any
of
those
great
improvements
on
the
miserable
heaths
of
hounslow
bagshot
and
windsor
forest
it
is
the
destructive
the
murderous
that
has
transferred
the
fruit
of
the
labour
and
the
people
along
with
it
from
the
different
parts
of
the
country
to
the
neighbourhood
of
the
i
do
not
believe
one
word
of
what
is
said
of
the
increase
of
the
population
all
observation
and
all
reason
is
against
the
fact
and
as
to
the
what
need
we
more
than
this
that
assert
that
the
population
of
great
britain
has
increased
from
ten
to
fourteen
millions
in
the
last
that
is
enough
a
man
that
can
suck
that
in
will
believe
literally
believe
that
the
moon
is
made
of
green
cheese
such
a
thing
is
too
monstrous
to
be
swallowed
by
any
body
but
englishmen
and
by
any
englishman
not
brutified
by
a
to
canning
sussex
december
sir
the
agreeable
news
from
france
relative
to
the
intended
invasion
of
spain
compelled
me
to
break
off
in
my
last
letter
in
the
middle
of
my
of
sunday
the
of
november
before
i
mount
again
which
i
shall
do
in
this
letter
pray
let
me
ask
you
what
of
is
to
be
offered
to
the
nation
if
the
french
bourbons
be
permitted
to
take
quiet
possession
of
cadiz
and
of
the
spanish
naval
force
perhaps
you
may
be
disposed
to
answer
when
you
have
taken
time
to
reflect
and
therefore
leaving
you
to
on
the
matter
i
will
resume
my
ride
sunday
from
hambledon
to
thursley
continued
from
i
did
not
go
on
to
froxfield
church
but
turned
off
to
the
left
to
a
place
a
couple
of
houses
called
near
this
i
stopped
at
a
friend
house
which
is
in
about
as
lonely
a
situation
as
i
ever
saw
a
very
pleasant
place
however
the
lands
dry
a
nice
mixture
of
woods
and
fields
and
a
great
variety
of
hill
and
dell
before
i
came
to
the
soil
of
the
hills
was
a
shallow
loam
with
flints
on
a
bottom
of
chalk
but
on
this
side
of
the
valley
of
that
is
to
say
on
the
north
side
the
soil
on
the
hills
is
a
deep
stiff
loam
on
a
bed
of
a
sort
of
gravel
mixed
with
chalk
and
the
stones
instead
of
being
grey
on
the
outside
and
blue
on
the
inside
are
yellow
on
the
outside
and
whitish
on
the
inside
in
coming
on
further
to
the
north
i
found
that
the
bottom
was
sometimes
gravel
and
sometime
chalk
here
at
the
time
when
it
that
formed
these
hills
and
valleys
the
stuff
of
which
hindhead
is
composed
seems
to
have
run
down
and
mixed
itself
with
the
stuff
of
which
winchester
is
composed
free
chalk
which
is
the
sort
found
here
is
excellent
manure
for
stiff
land
and
it
produces
a
complete
change
in
the
nature
of
it
is
therefore
dug
here
on
the
north
of
about
in
the
fields
where
it
happens
to
be
found
and
is
laid
out
upon
the
surface
where
it
is
crumbled
to
powder
by
the
frost
and
thus
gets
incorporated
with
the
loam
at
bower
i
got
instructions
to
go
to
hawkley
but
accompanied
with
most
earnest
advice
not
to
go
that
way
for
that
it
was
impossible
to
get
along
the
roads
were
represented
as
so
bad
the
floods
so
much
out
the
hills
and
bogs
so
dangerous
that
really
i
began
to
and
if
i
had
not
been
brought
up
amongst
the
clays
of
the
holt
forest
and
the
bogs
of
the
neighbouring
heaths
i
should
certainly
have
turned
off
to
my
right
to
go
over
hindhead
great
as
was
my
objection
to
going
that
way
well
then
said
my
friend
at
bower
if
you
go
that
way
by
g
you
must
go
down
of
which
he
then
gave
me
a
description
but
even
this
i
found
to
fall
short
of
the
reality
i
inquired
simply
whether
were
in
the
of
going
down
it
and
the
answer
being
in
the
affirmative
on
i
went
through
green
lanes
and
till
i
came
to
the
from
petersfield
to
winchester
which
i
crossed
going
into
a
narrow
and
almost
untrodden
green
lane
on
the
side
of
which
i
found
a
cottage
upon
my
asking
the
way
to
the
woman
at
the
cottage
said
right
up
the
lane
sir
you
come
to
a
presently
you
must
take
care
sir
you
ca
ride
down
will
your
horses
on
we
trotted
up
this
pretty
green
lane
and
indeed
we
had
been
coming
gently
and
generally
up
hill
for
a
good
while
the
lane
was
between
highish
banks
and
pretty
high
stuff
growing
on
the
banks
so
that
we
could
see
no
distance
from
us
and
could
receive
not
the
smallest
hint
of
what
was
so
near
at
hand
the
lane
had
a
little
turn
towards
the
end
so
that
out
we
came
all
in
a
moment
at
the
very
edge
of
the
hanger
and
never
in
all
my
life
was
i
so
surprised
and
so
delighted
i
pulled
up
my
horse
and
sat
and
looked
and
it
was
like
looking
from
the
top
of
a
castle
down
into
the
sea
except
that
the
valley
was
land
and
not
water
i
looked
at
my
servant
to
see
what
effect
this
unexpected
sight
had
upon
him
his
surprise
was
as
great
as
mine
though
he
had
been
bred
amongst
the
north
hampshire
hills
those
who
had
so
strenuously
dwelt
on
the
dirt
and
dangers
of
this
route
had
said
not
a
word
about
beauties
the
matchless
beauties
of
the
scenery
these
hangers
are
woods
on
the
sides
of
very
steep
hills
the
trees
and
underwood
in
some
sort
to
the
ground
instead
of
it
hence
these
places
are
called
from
the
summit
of
that
which
i
had
now
to
descend
i
looked
down
upon
the
villages
of
hawkley
greatham
selborne
and
some
others
from
the
round
southward
to
the
the
main
valley
has
running
out
of
it
the
hills
on
the
sides
of
which
are
very
steep
and
in
many
parts
covered
with
wood
the
hills
that
form
these
run
out
into
the
main
valley
like
piers
into
the
sea
two
of
these
promontories
of
great
height
are
on
the
west
side
of
the
main
valley
and
were
the
first
objects
that
struck
my
sight
when
i
came
to
the
edge
of
the
hanger
which
was
on
the
south
the
ends
of
these
promontories
are
nearly
perpendicular
and
their
tops
so
high
in
the
air
that
you
can
not
look
at
the
village
below
without
something
like
a
feeling
of
apprehension
the
leaves
are
all
off
the
are
in
stack
the
fields
have
little
verdure
but
while
the
spot
is
beautiful
beyond
description
even
now
i
must
leave
to
imagination
to
suppose
what
it
is
when
the
trees
and
hangers
and
hedges
are
in
leaf
the
corn
waving
the
meadows
bright
and
the
hops
upon
the
poles
from
the
round
eastward
to
the
north
lie
the
of
which
woolmer
forest
makes
a
part
and
these
go
gradually
rising
up
to
hindhead
the
crown
of
which
is
to
the
leaving
the
rest
of
the
circle
the
part
from
north
to
to
be
occupied
by
a
continuation
of
the
valley
towards
headley
binstead
frensham
and
the
holt
forest
so
that
even
the
in
the
view
from
the
top
of
the
hanger
is
as
great
as
can
possibly
be
imagined
men
however
are
not
to
have
such
beautiful
views
as
this
without
some
trouble
we
had
had
the
view
but
we
had
to
go
down
the
hanger
we
had
indeed
some
roads
to
get
along
as
we
could
afterwards
but
we
had
to
get
down
the
hanger
first
the
horses
took
the
lead
and
crept
partly
down
upon
their
feet
and
partly
upon
their
hocks
it
was
extremely
slippery
too
for
the
soil
is
a
sort
of
marle
or
as
they
call
it
here
maume
or
mame
which
is
when
wet
very
much
like
in
such
a
case
it
was
likely
that
i
should
keep
in
the
rear
which
i
did
and
i
descended
by
taking
hold
of
the
branches
of
the
underwood
and
so
letting
myself
down
when
we
got
to
the
bottom
i
bade
my
man
when
he
should
go
back
to
uphusband
tell
the
people
there
that
is
not
the
piece
of
road
in
the
world
our
worst
however
was
not
come
yet
nor
had
we
by
any
means
seen
the
most
novel
sights
after
crossing
a
little
field
and
going
through
a
we
came
into
a
lane
which
was
at
once
road
and
river
we
found
a
hard
bottom
however
and
when
we
got
out
of
the
water
we
got
into
a
lane
with
high
banks
the
banks
were
quarries
of
white
stone
like
and
the
bed
of
the
road
was
of
the
same
stone
and
the
rains
having
been
heavy
for
a
day
or
two
before
the
whole
was
as
clean
and
as
white
as
the
steps
of
a
or
in
one
of
the
squares
of
the
here
were
we
then
going
along
a
stone
road
with
stone
banks
and
yet
the
underwood
and
trees
grew
well
upon
the
tops
of
the
banks
in
the
solid
stone
beneath
us
there
were
a
and
the
former
about
three
and
the
latter
about
six
inches
deep
how
many
many
ages
it
must
have
taken
the
horses
feet
the
wheels
and
the
water
to
wear
down
this
stone
so
as
to
form
a
hollow
way
the
horses
seemed
alarmed
at
their
situation
they
trod
with
fear
but
they
took
us
along
very
nicely
and
at
last
got
us
safe
into
the
indescribable
dirt
and
mire
of
the
road
from
hawkley
green
to
greatham
here
the
bottom
of
all
the
land
is
this
solid
white
stone
and
the
top
is
that
which
i
have
before
described
the
penetrate
down
into
this
stone
how
deep
the
stone
may
go
i
know
not
but
when
i
came
to
look
up
at
the
end
of
one
of
the
piers
or
promontories
mentioned
above
i
found
that
it
was
all
of
this
same
stone
at
hawkley
green
i
asked
a
farmer
the
way
to
thursley
he
pointed
to
one
of
two
roads
going
from
the
green
but
it
appearing
to
me
that
that
would
lead
me
up
to
the
london
road
and
over
hindhead
i
gave
him
to
understand
that
i
was
resolved
to
get
along
somehow
or
other
through
the
low
countries
he
besought
me
not
to
think
of
it
however
finding
me
resolved
he
got
a
man
to
go
a
little
way
to
put
me
into
the
greatham
road
the
man
came
but
the
farmer
could
not
let
me
go
off
without
renewing
his
entreaties
that
i
would
go
away
to
liphook
in
which
entreaties
the
man
joined
though
he
was
to
be
paid
very
well
for
his
trouble
off
we
went
however
to
greatham
i
am
thinking
whether
i
ever
did
see
roads
upon
the
whole
i
think
i
have
though
i
am
not
sure
that
the
roads
of
new
jersey
between
trenton
and
at
the
breaking
up
of
winter
be
worse
talk
of
indeed
take
a
piece
of
this
road
just
a
cut
across
and
a
rod
long
and
carry
it
up
to
london
that
would
be
something
like
a
upon
leaving
greatham
we
came
out
upon
woolmer
forest
just
as
we
were
coming
out
of
greatham
i
asked
a
man
the
way
to
thursley
you
go
to
sir
said
he
but
i
said
i
go
to
liphook
these
people
seemed
to
be
posted
at
all
these
stages
to
turn
me
aside
from
my
purpose
and
to
make
me
go
over
that
which
i
had
resolved
to
avoid
i
went
on
a
little
further
and
asked
another
man
the
way
to
headley
which
as
i
have
already
observed
lies
on
the
western
foot
of
hindhead
whence
i
knew
there
must
be
a
road
to
thursley
which
lies
at
the
north
east
foot
without
going
over
that
miserable
hill
the
man
told
me
that
i
must
go
across
the
i
asked
him
whether
it
was
a
road
it
is
a
road
said
he
laying
a
weighty
emphasis
upon
the
word
do
people
it
said
i
said
he
oh
then
said
i
to
my
man
as
it
is
a
road
keep
you
close
to
my
heels
and
do
not
attempt
to
go
aside
not
even
for
a
foot
indeed
it
was
a
road
the
rain
of
the
night
had
made
the
fresh
horse
tracks
visible
and
we
got
to
headley
in
a
short
time
over
a
which
seemed
so
delightful
after
the
flints
and
stone
and
dirt
and
sloughs
that
we
had
passed
over
and
through
since
the
morning
this
road
was
not
if
we
had
been
benighted
without
its
dangers
the
forest
being
full
of
quags
and
quicksands
this
is
a
tract
of
crown
lands
or
properly
speaking
on
some
parts
of
which
our
land
steward
huskisson
is
making
some
plantations
of
trees
partly
fir
and
partly
other
trees
what
he
can
plant
the
for
god
only
knows
seeing
that
the
country
is
already
with
that
rubbish
but
this
concern
is
a
very
great
concern
if
i
were
a
member
of
parliament
i
know
what
timber
has
been
cut
down
and
what
it
has
been
sold
for
since
year
however
this
matter
must
be
first
or
last
it
never
can
be
omitted
in
the
winding
up
of
the
concern
and
that
winding
up
must
come
out
of
wheat
at
four
shillings
a
bushel
it
is
said
hereabouts
that
a
man
who
lives
near
liphook
and
who
is
so
mighty
a
hunter
and
game
pursuer
that
they
call
him
it
is
said
that
this
man
is
of
the
manor
of
woolmer
this
he
can
not
be
without
to
that
effect
and
if
there
be
a
grant
there
must
have
been
a
for
the
grant
this
i
should
very
much
like
to
know
and
this
i
would
know
if
i
were
a
member
of
parliament
that
the
people
call
him
the
of
the
is
certain
but
he
can
hardly
make
preserves
of
the
plantations
for
it
is
well
known
how
marvellously
and
agree
together
this
is
a
matter
of
great
public
importance
and
yet
how
in
the
present
state
of
things
is
an
to
be
obtained
is
there
a
man
in
parliament
that
will
call
for
it
not
one
would
a
dissolution
of
parliament
mend
the
matter
no
for
the
same
men
would
be
there
still
they
are
the
same
men
that
have
been
there
for
these
thirty
years
and
the
they
will
be
and
they
until
there
be
to
be
sure
when
one
dies
or
cuts
his
throat
as
in
the
case
of
castlereagh
another
comes
but
it
is
the
and
as
long
as
it
is
that
same
body
things
will
always
go
on
as
they
now
go
on
however
as
canning
says
the
body
we
must
not
say
the
contrary
the
soil
of
this
tract
is
generally
a
black
sand
which
in
some
places
becomes
which
makes
very
tolerable
fuel
in
some
parts
there
is
clay
at
bottom
and
there
the
would
grow
but
not
while
there
are
in
any
number
on
the
forest
if
trees
be
to
grow
here
there
ought
to
be
no
hares
and
as
little
hunting
as
possible
we
got
to
headly
the
sign
of
the
just
at
dusk
and
just
as
it
began
to
rain
i
had
neither
eaten
nor
drunk
since
eight
in
the
morning
and
as
it
was
a
nice
little
i
at
first
intended
to
stay
all
night
an
intention
that
i
afterwards
very
indiscreetly
gave
up
i
had
my
which
included
the
getting
to
thursley
that
night
when
therefore
i
had
got
some
cold
bacon
and
bread
and
some
milk
i
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
stopping
short
of
my
especially
after
having
so
heroically
persevered
in
the
stern
path
and
so
disdainfully
scorned
to
go
over
hindhead
i
knew
that
my
road
lay
through
a
hamlet
called
where
they
grow
such
fine
seed
there
was
a
moon
but
there
was
also
a
hazy
rain
i
had
heaths
to
go
over
and
i
might
go
into
quags
wishing
to
execute
my
plan
however
i
at
last
brought
myself
to
quit
a
very
comfortable
and
to
set
off
in
the
rain
having
bargained
to
give
a
man
three
shillings
to
guide
me
out
to
the
northern
foot
of
hindhead
i
took
care
to
ascertain
that
my
guide
knew
the
road
perfectly
well
that
is
to
say
i
took
care
to
ascertain
it
as
far
as
i
could
which
was
indeed
no
farther
than
his
word
would
go
off
we
set
the
guide
mounted
on
his
own
or
master
horse
and
with
a
white
smock
frock
which
enabled
us
to
see
him
clearly
we
trotted
on
pretty
fast
for
about
half
an
hour
and
i
perceived
not
without
some
surprise
that
the
rain
which
i
knew
to
be
coming
from
the
met
me
full
in
the
face
when
it
ought
according
to
my
reckoning
to
have
beat
upon
my
right
cheek
i
called
to
the
guide
repeatedly
to
ask
him
if
he
was
that
he
was
to
which
he
always
answered
oh
yes
sir
i
know
the
road
i
did
not
like
this
know
the
at
last
after
going
about
six
miles
in
nearly
a
southern
direction
the
guide
turned
short
to
the
left
that
brought
the
rain
upon
my
right
cheek
and
though
i
could
not
very
well
account
for
the
long
stretch
to
the
south
i
thought
that
at
any
rate
we
were
in
the
right
track
and
after
going
about
a
mile
in
this
new
direction
i
began
to
ask
the
guide
much
further
we
had
to
for
i
had
got
a
pretty
good
soaking
and
was
rather
impatient
to
see
the
foot
of
hindhead
just
at
this
time
in
raising
my
head
and
looking
forward
as
i
spoke
to
the
guide
what
should
i
see
but
a
long
high
and
steep
arising
before
us
the
trees
along
the
top
of
which
i
could
easily
distinguish
the
fact
was
we
were
just
getting
to
the
outside
of
the
heath
and
were
on
the
brow
of
a
steep
hill
which
faced
this
hanging
wood
the
guide
had
begun
to
descend
and
i
had
called
to
him
to
stop
for
the
hill
was
so
steep
that
rain
as
it
did
and
wet
as
my
saddle
must
be
i
got
off
my
horse
in
order
to
walk
down
but
now
behold
the
fellow
discovered
that
he
lost
his
where
we
were
i
could
not
even
guess
there
was
but
one
remedy
and
that
was
to
get
back
if
we
could
i
became
guide
now
and
did
as
western
is
advising
the
ministers
to
do
my
steps
we
went
back
about
half
the
way
that
we
had
come
when
we
saw
two
men
who
showed
us
the
way
that
we
ought
to
go
at
the
end
of
about
a
mile
we
fortunately
found
the
not
indeed
at
the
but
on
the
of
that
very
hindhead
on
which
i
had
so
repeatedly
i
would
not
go
we
came
out
on
the
turnpike
some
hundred
yards
on
the
liphook
side
of
the
buildings
called
so
that
we
had
the
whole
of
three
miles
of
hill
to
come
down
at
not
much
better
than
a
foot
pace
with
a
good
pelting
rain
at
our
backs
it
is
odd
enough
how
differently
one
is
affected
by
the
same
sight
under
different
circumstances
at
the
at
headly
there
was
a
room
full
of
fellows
in
white
smock
frocks
drinking
and
smoking
and
talking
and
i
who
was
then
dry
and
warm
within
myself
on
their
in
spending
their
time
in
such
a
way
but
when
i
got
down
from
hindhead
to
the
at
with
my
skin
soaking
and
my
teeth
chattering
i
thought
just
such
another
group
whom
i
saw
through
the
window
sitting
round
a
good
fire
with
pipes
in
their
mouths
the
i
had
ever
set
my
eyes
on
a
real
and
i
most
solemnly
declare
that
i
felt
a
greater
veneration
for
them
than
i
have
ever
felt
even
for
the
notwithstanding
the
right
honorable
charles
wynn
and
the
right
honorable
sir
john
sinclair
belong
to
the
latter
it
was
now
but
a
step
to
my
friend
house
where
a
good
fire
and
a
change
of
clothes
soon
put
all
to
rights
save
and
except
the
having
come
over
hindhead
after
all
my
resolutions
this
mortifying
circumstance
this
having
been
lost
the
guide
the
that
i
had
agreed
to
give
him
either
said
i
you
did
not
know
the
way
well
or
you
did
if
the
former
it
was
dishonest
in
you
to
undertake
to
guide
me
if
the
latter
you
have
wilfully
led
me
miles
out
of
my
way
he
grumbled
but
off
he
went
he
certainly
deserved
nothing
for
he
did
not
know
the
way
and
he
prevented
some
other
man
from
earning
and
receiving
the
money
but
had
he
not
caused
me
to
upon
he
would
have
had
the
three
shillings
i
had
at
one
time
got
my
hand
in
my
pocket
but
the
thought
of
having
been
pulled
it
out
again
thus
ended
the
most
interesting
day
as
far
as
i
know
that
i
ever
passed
in
all
my
life
promontories
and
will
always
come
into
my
mind
when
i
see
or
hear
of
picturesque
views
i
forgot
to
mention
that
in
going
from
hawkley
to
greatham
the
man
who
went
to
show
me
the
way
told
me
at
a
certain
fork
that
road
goes
to
this
put
me
in
mind
of
a
book
which
was
once
recommended
to
me
but
which
i
never
saw
entitled
history
and
antiquities
of
or
something
of
that
sort
written
i
think
by
a
parson
of
the
name
of
brother
of
so
long
a
bookseller
in
this
parson
had
i
think
the
living
of
the
parish
of
selborne
the
book
was
mentioned
to
me
as
a
work
of
great
curiosity
and
interest
but
at
that
time
the
thing
was
biting
very
that
one
had
no
attention
to
bestow
on
antiquarian
researches
wheat
at
a
quarter
and
southdown
ewes
at
have
so
weakened
the
thing
jaws
and
so
filed
down
its
teeth
that
i
shall
now
certainly
read
this
book
if
i
can
get
it
if
the
had
for
the
last
thirty
years
employed
their
leisure
time
in
writing
the
histories
of
their
several
parishes
instead
of
living
as
many
of
them
have
engaged
in
pursuits
that
i
need
not
here
name
neither
their
situation
nor
that
of
their
flocks
would
perhaps
have
been
the
worse
for
it
at
this
day
surrey
in
looking
back
into
hampshire
i
see
with
pleasure
the
farmers
bestirring
themselves
to
get
a
county
meeting
called
there
were
i
was
told
nearly
five
hundred
names
to
a
requisition
and
those
all
of
or
precisely
what
they
mean
to
petition
for
i
do
not
know
but
and
now
i
address
myself
to
you
canning
if
they
do
not
petition
a
reform
of
the
they
will
do
worse
than
nothing
you
sir
have
often
told
us
that
the
house
however
got
together
works
well
now
as
i
said
in
just
before
i
went
to
america
to
get
out
of
the
reach
of
our
friend
the
and
to
use
my
as
i
said
then
in
a
letter
addressed
to
lord
grosvenor
so
i
say
now
show
me
the
inexpediency
of
reform
and
i
will
hold
my
tongue
show
us
prove
to
us
that
the
house
works
well
and
i
for
my
part
give
the
matter
up
it
is
not
the
construction
or
the
motions
of
a
machine
that
i
ever
look
at
all
i
look
after
is
when
indeed
i
find
that
the
effect
is
deficient
or
evil
i
look
to
the
construction
and
as
i
now
see
and
have
for
many
years
seen
evil
effect
i
seek
a
remedy
in
an
alteration
in
the
machine
there
is
now
nobody
no
not
a
single
man
out
of
the
regions
of
whitehall
who
will
pretend
that
the
country
can
without
the
risk
of
some
great
and
terrible
convulsion
go
on
even
for
twelve
months
longer
unless
there
be
a
great
change
of
some
sort
in
the
mode
of
managing
the
public
affairs
could
you
see
and
hear
what
i
have
seen
and
heard
during
this
rural
ride
you
would
no
longer
say
that
the
house
works
well
canning
and
your
children
are
dear
to
you
but
sir
not
more
dear
than
are
to
them
the
wives
and
children
of
perhaps
two
hundred
thousand
men
who
by
the
acts
of
this
same
house
see
those
wives
and
children
doomed
to
beggary
and
to
beggary
too
never
thought
of
never
regarded
as
more
likely
than
a
blowing
up
of
the
earth
or
a
falling
of
the
sun
it
was
reserved
for
this
working
well
house
to
make
the
of
farmers
scenes
of
gloom
these
in
which
i
have
always
so
delighted
i
now
approach
with
pain
i
was
not
long
ago
sitting
round
the
fire
with
as
worthy
and
as
industrious
a
man
as
all
england
contains
there
was
his
son
about
years
of
age
two
daughters
from
to
and
a
little
boy
sitting
on
the
father
knee
i
knew
but
not
from
him
that
there
was
on
his
farm
i
was
anxious
to
induce
him
sell
without
with
this
view
i
in
an
hypothetical
and
way
approached
and
at
last
i
came
to
final
consequences
the
deep
and
deeper
gloom
on
a
countenance
once
so
cheerful
told
me
what
was
passing
in
his
breast
when
turning
away
my
looks
in
order
to
seem
not
to
perceive
the
effect
of
my
words
i
saw
the
eyes
of
his
wife
full
of
tears
she
had
made
the
application
and
there
were
her
children
before
her
and
am
i
to
be
for
if
i
express
what
i
felt
upon
this
occasion
and
does
this
house
then
work
well
how
many
men
of
the
most
industrious
the
most
upright
the
most
exemplary
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
have
been
by
this
one
act
of
this
house
driven
to
despair
ending
in
madness
or
or
both
nay
how
many
scores
and
yet
are
we
to
be
banished
for
life
if
we
endeavour
to
show
that
this
house
does
not
work
well
however
banish
or
banish
not
these
facts
are
notorious
made
all
the
which
constitute
the
debt
contracted
for
the
dead
weight
put
a
stop
to
in
unanimously
passed
peel
bill
here
are
the
causes
of
the
ruin
the
misery
the
anguish
the
despair
and
the
madness
and
here
they
are
they
have
all
been
acts
of
this
house
and
yet
we
are
to
be
banished
if
we
say
in
words
suitable
to
the
subject
that
this
house
does
not
this
one
act
i
mean
this
would
be
enough
with
posterity
to
characterize
this
house
when
they
read
and
can
believe
what
they
read
that
it
actually
passed
a
law
to
banish
for
life
any
one
who
should
write
print
or
publish
anything
having
a
to
bring
it
into
when
posterity
shall
read
this
and
believe
it
they
will
want
nothing
more
to
enable
them
to
say
what
sort
of
an
assembly
it
was
it
was
delightful
too
that
they
should
pass
this
law
just
after
they
had
passed
oh
god
thou
art
as
to
it
let
what
else
will
happen
it
must
come
whether
before
or
after
all
the
estates
be
transferred
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
know
very
well
that
the
later
it
come
the
will
it
go
i
shall
of
course
go
on
remarking
as
occasion
offers
upon
what
is
done
by
and
said
in
this
present
house
but
i
know
that
it
can
do
nothing
efficient
for
the
relief
of
the
country
i
have
seen
some
men
of
late
who
seem
to
think
that
even
a
reform
enacted
or
begun
by
this
house
would
be
an
evil
and
that
it
would
be
better
to
let
the
whole
thing
go
on
and
produce
its
natural
consequence
i
am
not
of
this
opinion
i
am
for
a
reform
as
soon
as
possible
even
though
it
be
not
at
first
precisely
what
i
could
wish
because
if
the
debt
blow
up
before
the
reform
take
place
confusion
and
uproar
there
must
be
and
i
do
not
want
to
see
confusion
and
uproar
i
am
for
a
reform
of
and
but
when
i
say
of
i
do
not
mean
of
lord
john
russell
sort
i
do
not
mean
a
reform
in
the
lopez
way
in
short
what
i
want
is
to
see
the
changed
i
want
to
see
in
the
house
and
as
to
those
other
men
should
be
i
really
should
not
be
very
nice
i
have
seen
the
tierneys
the
bankeses
the
wilberforces
the
michael
angelo
taylors
the
lambs
the
lowthers
the
davis
giddies
the
sir
john
sebrights
the
sir
francis
burdetts
the
hobhouses
old
or
young
whitbreads
the
same
the
lord
johns
and
the
lord
williams
and
the
lord
henries
and
the
lord
charleses
and
in
short
all
whole
i
have
seen
them
all
there
all
the
same
faces
and
names
all
my
life
time
i
see
that
neither
adjournment
nor
prorogation
nor
dissolution
makes
any
change
in
and
caprice
let
it
be
if
you
like
i
want
to
see
a
change
the
these
have
done
enough
in
all
conscience
or
at
least
they
have
done
enough
to
satisfy
me
i
want
to
see
some
fresh
faces
and
to
hear
a
change
of
some
sort
or
other
in
the
sounds
a
coming
everlastingly
from
the
same
mouths
is
what
i
for
my
part
am
tired
of
i
am
aware
that
this
is
not
what
the
in
the
house
mean
they
mean
on
the
contrary
no
such
thing
as
a
change
of
men
they
mean
that
should
sit
there
for
ever
or
at
least
till
succeeded
by
a
legitimate
heir
i
believe
that
sir
francis
burdett
for
instance
has
not
the
smallest
idea
of
an
act
of
parliament
ever
being
made
without
his
assistance
if
he
chooses
to
assist
which
is
not
very
frequently
the
case
i
believe
that
he
looks
upon
a
seat
in
the
house
as
being
his
property
and
that
the
other
seat
is
and
ought
to
be
held
as
a
sort
of
leasehold
or
copyhold
under
him
my
idea
of
reform
therefore
my
change
of
faces
and
of
names
and
of
sounds
will
appear
quite
horrible
to
him
however
i
think
the
nation
begins
to
be
very
much
of
my
way
of
thinking
and
this
i
am
very
sure
of
that
we
shall
never
see
that
change
in
the
management
of
affairs
which
we
most
of
us
want
to
see
unless
there
be
a
pretty
complete
change
of
men
some
people
will
blame
me
for
speaking
out
so
broadly
upon
this
subject
but
i
think
it
the
best
way
to
disguise
nothing
to
do
what
is
to
be
sincere
and
to
let
come
what
will
november
to
i
came
here
to
meet
my
son
who
was
to
return
to
london
when
we
had
done
our
the
turnips
are
pretty
good
all
over
the
country
except
upon
the
very
thin
soils
on
the
chalk
at
thursley
they
are
very
good
and
so
they
are
upon
all
these
nice
light
and
good
lands
round
about
godalming
this
is
a
very
pretty
country
you
see
few
prettier
spots
than
this
the
chain
of
little
hills
that
run
along
to
the
south
and
of
godalming
and
the
soil
which
is
a
good
loam
upon
a
bottom
run
down
on
the
south
side
into
what
is
called
the
this
weald
is
a
bed
of
clay
in
which
nothing
grows
well
but
oak
trees
it
is
first
the
weald
of
surrey
and
then
the
weald
of
sussex
it
runs
along
on
the
south
of
dorking
reigate
bletchingley
godstone
and
then
winds
away
down
into
kent
in
no
part
of
it
as
far
as
i
have
observed
do
the
oaks
grow
finer
than
between
the
on
the
south
of
godstone
and
a
place
called
fellbridge
where
the
county
of
surrey
terminates
on
the
road
to
east
grinstead
at
godalming
we
heard
some
account
of
a
lawsuit
between
holme
sumner
and
his
tenant
nash
but
the
particulars
i
must
reserve
till
i
have
them
in
black
and
white
in
all
parts
of
the
country
i
hear
of
landlords
that
begin
to
which
is
a
certain
proof
that
they
begin
to
feel
the
bottom
of
their
tenants
pockets
no
man
can
pay
rent
i
mean
any
rent
at
all
except
out
of
capital
or
except
under
some
peculiar
circumstances
such
as
having
a
farm
near
a
spot
where
the
fundholders
are
building
houses
when
i
was
in
hampshire
i
heard
of
terrible
breakings
up
in
the
isle
of
wight
they
say
that
the
general
rout
is
very
near
at
hand
there
i
heard
of
one
farmer
who
held
a
farm
at
seven
hundred
pounds
who
paid
his
rent
annually
and
punctually
who
had
of
course
seven
hundred
pounds
to
pay
to
his
landlord
last
michaelmas
but
who
before
michaelmas
came
thrashed
out
and
sold
the
harvest
being
so
early
the
whole
of
his
corn
sold
off
his
stock
bit
by
bit
got
the
very
goods
out
of
his
house
leaving
only
a
bed
and
some
trifling
things
sailed
with
a
fair
wind
over
to
france
with
his
family
put
his
into
the
house
to
keep
possession
of
the
house
and
farm
and
to
prevent
the
landlord
from
entering
upon
the
land
for
a
year
or
better
unless
he
would
pay
to
the
a
certain
sum
of
money
doubtless
the
landlord
had
already
sucked
away
about
three
or
four
times
seven
hundred
pounds
from
this
farmer
he
would
not
be
able
to
enter
upon
his
farm
without
a
process
that
would
cost
him
some
money
and
without
the
farm
being
pretty
well
stocked
with
thistles
and
docks
and
perhaps
laid
half
to
common
farmers
on
the
coast
opposite
france
are
not
so
firmly
bounden
as
those
in
the
interior
some
hundreds
of
these
will
have
carried
their
allegiance
their
capital
what
they
have
left
and
their
skill
to
go
and
grease
the
fat
sow
our
old
friends
the
bourbons
i
hear
of
a
sharp
greedy
hungry
shark
of
a
landlord
who
says
that
some
law
must
be
passed
that
parliament
must
do
something
to
prevent
this
there
is
a
pretty
fool
for
you
there
is
a
great
jackass
i
beg
the
real
jackass
pardon
to
imagine
that
the
people
at
westminster
can
do
anything
to
prevent
the
french
from
suffering
people
to
come
with
their
money
to
settle
in
france
this
fool
does
not
know
perhaps
that
there
are
members
of
parliament
that
live
in
france
more
than
they
do
in
england
i
have
heard
of
one
who
not
only
lives
there
but
carries
on
vineyards
there
and
is
never
absent
from
them
except
when
he
comes
over
to
attend
to
his
duties
in
parliament
he
perhaps
sells
his
wine
at
the
same
time
and
that
being
genuine
doubtless
brings
him
a
good
price
so
that
the
occupations
harmonize
together
very
well
the
isle
of
wight
must
be
rather
peculiarly
distressed
for
it
was
the
scene
of
monstrous
expenditure
when
the
whigs
were
in
power
in
it
was
proved
to
them
and
to
the
parliament
that
in
several
instances
in
the
isle
of
wight
was
rented
by
the
envy
of
surrounding
nations
for
more
money
than
the
rest
of
the
whole
farm
these
barns
were
wanted
as
and
indeed
such
things
were
carried
on
in
that
island
as
never
could
have
been
carried
on
under
anything
that
was
not
absolutely
the
admiration
of
the
world
these
sweet
pickings
caused
doubtless
a
great
rise
in
the
rent
of
the
farms
so
that
in
this
island
there
is
not
only
the
depression
of
price
and
a
greater
depression
than
anywhere
else
but
also
the
loss
of
the
pickings
and
these
together
leave
the
tenants
but
this
simple
choice
beggary
or
flight
and
as
most
of
them
have
had
a
pretty
deal
of
capital
and
will
be
likely
to
have
some
left
as
yet
they
will
as
they
perceive
the
danger
naturally
flee
for
succour
to
the
bourbons
this
is
indeed
something
new
in
the
history
of
english
agriculture
and
were
not
canning
so
positive
to
the
contrary
one
would
almost
imagine
that
the
thing
which
has
produced
it
does
not
work
so
very
well
however
that
gentleman
seems
resolved
to
prevent
us
by
his
of
and
his
two
from
having
any
change
in
this
thing
and
therefore
the
landlords
in
the
isle
of
wight
as
well
as
elsewhere
must
make
the
best
of
the
matter
went
on
to
guildford
where
i
slept
everybody
that
has
been
from
godalming
to
guildford
knows
that
there
is
hardly
another
such
a
pretty
four
miles
in
all
england
the
road
is
good
the
soil
is
good
the
houses
are
neat
the
people
are
neat
the
hills
the
woods
the
meadows
all
are
beautiful
nothing
wild
and
bold
to
be
sure
but
exceedingly
pretty
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
ride
along
these
four
miles
without
feelings
of
pleasure
though
you
have
rain
for
your
companion
as
it
happened
to
be
with
me
november
i
came
over
the
high
hill
on
the
south
of
guildford
and
came
down
to
chilworth
and
up
the
valley
to
albury
i
noticed
in
my
first
rural
ride
this
beautiful
valley
its
hangers
its
meadows
its
and
its
ponds
this
valley
of
chilworth
has
great
variety
and
is
very
pretty
but
after
seeing
hawkley
every
other
place
loses
in
point
of
beauty
and
interest
this
pretty
valley
of
chilworth
has
a
run
of
water
which
comes
out
of
the
high
hills
and
which
occasionally
spreads
into
a
pond
so
that
there
is
in
fact
a
series
of
ponds
connected
by
this
run
of
water
this
valley
which
seems
to
have
been
created
by
a
bountiful
providence
as
one
of
the
choicest
retreats
of
man
which
seems
formed
for
a
scene
of
innocence
and
happiness
has
been
by
ungrateful
man
so
perverted
as
to
make
it
instrumental
in
effecting
two
of
the
most
damnable
of
purposes
in
carrying
into
execution
two
of
the
most
damnable
inventions
that
ever
sprang
from
the
minds
of
man
under
the
influence
of
the
devil
namely
the
making
of
and
of
here
in
this
tranquil
spot
where
the
nightingales
are
to
be
heard
earlier
and
later
in
the
year
than
in
any
other
part
of
england
where
the
first
bursting
of
the
buds
is
seen
in
spring
where
no
rigour
of
seasons
can
ever
be
felt
where
everything
seems
formed
for
precluding
the
very
thought
of
wickedness
here
has
the
devil
fixed
on
as
one
of
the
seats
of
his
grand
manufactory
and
perverse
and
ungrateful
man
not
only
lends
him
his
aid
but
lends
it
cheerfully
as
to
the
gunpowder
indeed
we
might
get
over
that
in
some
cases
that
may
be
innocently
and
when
it
sends
the
lead
at
the
hordes
that
support
a
tyrant
meritoriously
employed
the
alders
and
the
willows
therefore
one
can
see
without
so
much
regret
turned
into
powder
by
the
waters
of
this
valley
but
the
to
think
that
the
springs
which
god
has
commanded
to
flow
from
the
sides
of
these
happy
hills
for
the
comfort
and
the
delight
of
man
to
think
that
these
springs
should
be
perverted
into
means
of
spreading
misery
over
a
whole
nation
and
that
too
under
the
base
and
hypocritical
pretence
of
promoting
its
and
maintaining
its
and
its
there
was
one
circumstance
indeed
that
served
to
mitigate
the
melancholy
excited
by
these
reflections
namely
that
a
part
of
these
springs
have
at
times
assisted
in
turning
rags
into
somewhat
cheered
by
the
thought
of
this
but
still
in
a
more
melancholy
mood
than
i
had
been
for
a
long
while
i
rode
on
with
my
friend
towards
up
the
valley
the
on
one
side
of
us
and
the
on
the
other
albury
is
a
little
village
consisting
of
a
few
houses
with
a
large
house
or
two
near
it
at
the
end
of
the
village
we
came
to
a
park
which
is
the
residence
of
mr
having
heard
a
great
deal
of
this
park
and
of
the
gardens
i
wished
very
much
to
see
them
my
way
to
dorking
lay
through
shire
and
it
went
along
on
the
outside
of
the
park
i
as
the
yankees
say
that
there
must
be
a
way
through
the
park
to
shire
and
i
fell
upon
the
scheme
of
going
into
the
park
as
far
as
drummond
house
and
then
asking
his
leave
to
go
out
at
the
other
end
of
it
this
scheme
though
pretty
succeeded
very
well
it
is
true
that
i
was
aware
that
i
had
not
a
to
deal
with
or
i
should
not
have
ventured
upon
the
experiment
i
sent
in
word
that
having
got
into
the
park
i
should
be
exceedingly
obliged
to
drummond
if
he
would
let
me
go
out
of
it
on
the
side
next
to
shire
he
not
only
granted
this
request
but
in
the
most
obliging
manner
permitted
us
to
ride
all
about
the
park
and
to
see
his
gardens
which
without
any
exception
are
to
my
fancy
the
prettiest
in
england
that
is
to
say
that
i
ever
saw
in
england
they
say
that
these
gardens
were
laid
out
for
one
of
the
howards
in
the
reign
of
charles
the
second
by
evelyn
who
wrote
the
the
which
is
by
no
means
magnificent
stands
on
a
little
flat
by
the
side
of
the
parish
church
having
a
steep
but
not
lofty
hill
rising
up
on
the
south
side
of
it
it
looks
right
across
the
gardens
which
lie
on
the
slope
of
a
hill
which
runs
along
at
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
distant
from
the
front
of
the
house
the
gardens
of
course
lie
facing
the
south
at
the
back
of
them
under
the
hill
is
a
high
wall
and
there
is
also
a
wall
at
each
end
running
from
north
to
south
between
the
house
and
the
gardens
there
is
a
very
beautiful
run
of
water
with
a
sort
of
little
wild
narrow
sedgy
meadow
the
gardens
are
separated
from
this
by
a
hedge
running
along
from
east
to
west
from
this
hedge
there
go
up
the
hill
at
right
angles
several
other
hedges
which
divide
the
land
here
into
distinct
gardens
or
orchards
along
at
the
top
of
these
there
goes
a
yew
hedge
or
rather
a
row
of
small
yew
trees
the
trunks
of
which
are
bare
for
about
eight
or
ten
feet
high
and
the
tops
of
which
form
one
solid
head
of
about
ten
feet
high
while
the
bottom
branches
come
out
on
each
side
of
the
row
about
eight
feet
horizontally
this
hedge
or
row
is
quarter
of
a
mile
there
is
a
nice
hard
under
this
species
of
umbrella
and
summer
and
winter
here
is
a
most
delightful
walk
behind
this
row
of
yews
there
is
a
space
or
garden
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
you
will
observe
about
thirty
or
forty
feet
wide
as
nearly
as
i
can
recollect
at
the
back
of
this
garden
and
facing
the
row
is
a
wall
probably
ten
feet
high
which
forms
the
breastwork
of
a
and
it
is
this
terrace
which
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
that
i
ever
saw
in
the
gardening
way
it
is
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
and
i
believe
between
thirty
and
forty
feet
wide
of
the
finest
green
sward
and
as
level
as
a
die
the
wall
along
at
the
back
of
this
terrace
stands
close
against
the
hill
which
you
see
with
the
trees
and
underwood
upon
it
rising
above
the
wall
so
that
here
is
the
finest
spot
for
fruit
trees
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
at
both
ends
of
this
garden
the
trees
in
the
park
are
lofty
and
there
are
a
pretty
many
of
them
the
hills
on
the
south
side
of
the
are
covered
with
lofty
trees
chiefly
beeches
and
chestnut
so
that
a
warmer
a
more
sheltered
spot
than
this
it
seems
to
be
impossible
to
imagine
observe
too
how
judicious
it
was
to
plant
the
row
of
yew
trees
at
the
distance
which
i
have
described
from
the
wall
which
forms
the
breastwork
of
the
terrace
that
wall
as
well
as
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
terrace
are
covered
with
fruit
trees
and
the
yew
tree
row
is
just
high
enough
to
defend
the
former
from
winds
without
injuring
it
by
its
shade
in
the
middle
of
the
wall
at
the
back
of
the
terrace
there
is
a
recess
about
thirty
feet
in
front
and
twenty
feet
deep
and
here
is
a
into
which
rises
a
spring
coming
out
of
the
hill
the
overflowings
of
this
basin
go
under
the
terrace
and
down
across
the
garden
into
the
rivulet
below
so
that
here
is
water
at
the
top
across
the
middle
and
along
at
the
bottom
of
this
garden
take
it
altogether
this
certainly
is
the
prettiest
garden
that
i
ever
beheld
there
was
taste
and
sound
judgment
at
every
step
in
the
laying
out
of
this
place
everywhere
utility
and
convenience
is
combined
with
beauty
the
terrace
is
by
far
the
finest
thing
of
the
sort
that
i
ever
saw
and
the
whole
thing
altogether
is
a
great
compliment
to
the
taste
of
the
times
in
which
it
was
formed
i
know
there
are
some
persons
who
will
say
that
i
want
a
revolution
that
would
turn
drummond
out
of
this
place
and
put
me
into
it
such
persons
will
hardly
believe
me
but
upon
my
word
i
do
not
from
everything
that
i
hear
drummond
is
very
worthy
of
possessing
it
himself
seeing
that
he
is
famed
for
his
justice
and
his
kindness
the
labouring
who
god
knows
have
very
few
friends
amongst
the
rich
if
what
i
have
heard
be
true
drummond
is
singularly
good
in
this
way
for
instead
of
hunting
down
an
unfortunate
creature
who
has
exposed
himself
to
the
lash
of
the
law
instead
of
regarding
a
crime
committed
as
proof
of
an
inherent
disposition
to
commit
crime
instead
of
rendering
the
poor
creatures
desperate
by
this
species
of
and
forcing
them
on
to
the
merely
because
they
have
once
merited
the
instead
of
this
which
is
the
common
practice
throughout
the
country
he
rather
seeks
for
such
unfortunate
creatures
to
take
them
into
his
employ
and
thus
to
reclaim
them
and
to
make
them
repent
of
their
former
courses
if
this
be
true
and
i
am
credibly
informed
that
it
is
i
know
of
no
man
in
england
so
worthy
of
his
estate
there
may
be
others
to
act
in
like
manner
but
i
neither
know
nor
have
heard
of
any
other
i
had
indeed
heard
of
this
at
alresford
in
hampshire
and
to
say
the
truth
it
was
this
circumstance
and
this
alone
which
induced
me
to
ask
the
favour
of
drummond
to
go
through
his
park
but
besides
that
drummond
is
very
worthy
of
his
estate
what
chance
should
i
have
of
getting
it
if
it
came
to
a
there
are
others
who
like
pretty
gardens
as
well
as
i
and
if
the
question
were
to
be
decided
according
to
the
law
of
the
strongest
or
as
the
french
call
it
by
the
du
plus
my
chance
would
be
but
a
very
poor
one
the
truth
is
that
you
hear
nothing
but
talk
about
revolutions
for
the
purpose
of
getting
possession
of
people
they
never
have
their
spring
in
any
such
motives
they
are
by
governments
and
though
they
do
sometimes
cause
a
new
distribution
of
property
to
a
certain
extent
there
never
was
perhaps
one
single
man
in
this
world
that
had
anything
to
do
worth
speaking
of
in
the
causing
of
a
revolution
that
did
it
with
any
such
view
but
what
a
strange
thing
it
is
that
there
should
be
men
at
this
time
to
fear
loss
of
as
the
consequence
of
a
convulsive
revolution
at
this
time
when
the
estates
are
actually
passing
away
from
the
owners
before
their
eyes
and
that
too
in
consequence
of
measures
which
have
been
adopted
for
what
has
been
called
the
of
against
the
designs
of
jacobins
and
radicals
drummond
has
i
dare
say
the
means
of
preventing
his
estate
from
being
actually
taken
away
from
him
but
i
am
quite
certain
that
that
estate
except
as
a
place
to
live
at
is
not
worth
to
him
at
this
moment
one
single
farthing
what
could
a
revolution
do
for
him
than
this
if
one
could
suppose
the
power
of
doing
what
they
like
placed
in
the
hands
of
the
labouring
classes
if
one
could
suppose
such
a
thing
as
this
which
never
was
yet
seen
if
one
could
suppose
anything
so
monstrous
as
that
of
a
revolution
that
would
leave
no
public
authority
anywhere
even
in
such
a
case
it
is
against
nature
to
suppose
that
the
people
would
come
and
turn
him
out
of
his
house
and
leave
him
without
food
and
yet
that
they
must
do
to
make
him
as
a
landholder
worse
off
than
he
is
or
at
least
worse
off
than
he
must
be
in
a
very
short
time
i
saw
in
the
gardens
at
albury
park
what
i
never
saw
before
in
all
my
life
that
is
some
plants
of
the
i
never
saw
them
in
america
for
there
they
grow
in
those
swamps
into
which
i
never
happened
to
go
at
the
time
of
their
bearing
fruit
i
may
have
seen
the
plant
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
did
here
it
not
only
grows
but
bears
and
there
are
still
some
cranberries
on
the
plants
now
i
tasted
them
and
they
appeared
to
me
to
have
just
the
same
taste
as
those
in
america
they
grew
in
a
long
bed
near
the
stream
of
water
which
i
have
spoken
about
and
therefore
it
is
clear
that
they
may
be
cultivated
with
great
ease
in
this
country
the
road
through
shire
along
to
dorking
runs
up
the
valley
between
the
and
the
the
chalk
to
our
left
and
the
sand
to
our
right
this
is
called
the
home
dale
it
begins
at
reigate
and
terminates
at
shalford
common
down
below
chilworth
december
i
set
off
this
morning
with
an
intention
to
go
across
the
weald
to
worth
but
the
red
rising
of
the
sun
and
the
other
appearances
of
the
morning
admonished
me
to
keep
upon
so
i
crossed
the
mole
went
along
under
boxhill
through
betchworth
and
buckland
and
got
to
this
place
just
at
the
beginning
of
a
day
of
as
heavy
rain
and
as
boisterous
wind
as
i
think
i
have
ever
known
in
england
one
rotten
borough
one
of
the
most
rotten
too
and
with
another
still
more
rotten
upon
the
in
reigate
and
close
by
gatton
how
can
i
help
reflecting
how
can
my
mind
be
otherwise
than
filled
with
reflections
on
the
marvellous
deeds
of
the
collective
wisdom
of
the
nation
at
present
however
for
i
want
to
get
to
bed
i
will
notice
only
one
of
those
deeds
and
that
one
yet
a
word
which
canning
seems
to
have
coined
for
the
which
is
not
a
coined
word
when
lord
castlereagh
who
cut
his
throat
the
other
day
was
accused
of
making
a
as
the
call
it
of
a
against
a
it
is
as
the
yankees
call
it
but
as
our
call
it
or
the
case
was
this
the
chop
had
been
it
had
been
entered
on
but
had
not
been
completed
just
as
two
jockeys
may
have
on
a
chop
and
yet
not
actually
the
horses
to
one
another
therefore
canning
said
that
the
act
was
which
means
without
cohesion
without
consequence
whereupon
the
house
entered
on
its
journals
a
solemn
resolution
that
it
was
its
duty
to
over
its
purity
with
the
greatest
but
that
the
said
act
being
the
house
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
proceed
any
further
in
the
matter
it
unfortunately
happened
however
that
in
a
very
few
days
afterwards
that
is
to
say
on
the
memorable
eleventh
of
june
maddocks
accused
the
very
same
castlereagh
of
having
actually
sold
and
delivered
a
seat
to
quintin
dick
for
three
thousand
pounds
the
accuser
said
he
was
ready
to
bring
to
the
bar
proof
of
the
fact
and
he
moved
that
he
might
be
permitted
so
to
do
now
then
what
did
canning
say
why
he
said
that
the
reformers
were
a
low
degraded
crew
and
he
called
upon
the
house
to
make
a
stand
against
democratical
encroachment
and
the
house
did
not
listen
to
him
surely
yes
but
it
did
and
it
voted
by
a
thundering
majority
that
it
would
not
hear
the
evidence
and
this
vote
was
by
the
leader
of
the
whigs
justified
upon
the
ground
that
the
deed
complained
of
by
maddocks
was
according
to
a
practice
which
was
as
notorious
as
sun
at
noon
so
much
for
the
word
which
has
led
me
into
this
long
digression
the
deed
or
achievement
of
which
i
am
now
about
to
speak
is
not
the
marriage
act
for
that
is
enough
that
has
had
plenty
of
consequences
it
is
the
new
turnpike
act
which
though
passed
is
as
yet
incohete
and
is
not
to
be
cohete
for
some
time
yet
to
come
i
hope
it
will
become
during
the
time
that
parliament
is
sitting
for
otherwise
it
will
have
pretty
nearly
equal
to
that
of
the
marriage
act
in
the
first
place
this
act
makes
and
everywhere
liable
to
turnpike
duty
which
in
many
cases
they
were
not
before
this
is
a
monstrous
oppression
upon
the
owners
and
occupiers
of
clay
lands
and
comes
just
at
the
time
too
when
they
are
upon
the
point
many
of
them
of
being
driven
out
of
cultivation
or
thrown
up
to
the
parish
by
other
burdens
but
it
is
the
provision
with
regard
to
the
which
will
create
the
greatest
injury
distress
and
confusion
the
wheels
which
this
law
orders
to
be
used
on
turnpike
roads
on
pain
of
enormous
toll
can
not
be
used
on
the
throughout
more
than
of
the
kingdom
to
make
these
roads
and
the
the
private
roads
of
farms
fit
for
the
cylindrical
wheels
described
in
this
bill
would
cost
a
pound
an
acre
upon
an
average
upon
all
the
land
in
england
and
especially
in
the
counties
where
the
land
is
poorest
it
would
in
these
counties
cost
a
tenth
part
of
the
worth
of
the
of
the
land
and
this
is
enacted
too
at
a
time
when
the
wagons
the
carts
and
all
the
dead
stock
of
a
farm
when
the
whole
is
falling
into
a
state
of
irrepair
when
all
is
actually
perishing
for
want
of
means
in
the
farmer
to
keep
it
in
repair
this
is
the
time
that
the
lord
johns
and
the
lord
henries
and
the
rest
of
that
honourable
body
have
thought
proper
to
enact
that
the
whole
of
the
farmers
in
england
shall
have
new
wheels
to
their
wagons
and
carts
or
that
they
shall
be
punished
by
the
payment
of
heavier
tolls
it
is
useless
perhaps
to
say
anything
about
the
matter
but
i
could
not
help
noticing
a
thing
which
has
created
such
a
general
alarm
amongst
the
farmers
in
every
part
of
the
country
where
i
have
recently
been
sussex
december
i
set
off
from
reigate
this
morning
and
after
a
pleasant
ride
of
ten
miles
got
here
to
here
as
everywhere
else
the
farmers
appear
to
think
that
their
last
hour
is
mr
b
i
believe
it
is
charles
b
and
i
should
be
sorry
to
withhold
from
him
his
title
though
being
said
to
be
a
very
good
sort
of
a
man
he
might
perhaps
be
able
to
shift
without
it
this
gentleman
farms
are
subject
of
conversation
here
the
matter
is
curious
in
itself
and
very
well
worthy
of
attention
as
illustrative
of
the
present
state
of
things
these
farms
were
last
year
taken
into
hand
by
the
owner
this
was
stated
in
the
public
papers
about
a
twelvemonth
ago
it
was
said
that
his
tenants
would
not
take
the
farms
again
at
the
rent
which
he
wished
to
have
and
that
therefore
he
took
the
farms
into
hand
these
farms
lie
somewhere
down
in
the
west
of
sussex
in
the
month
of
august
last
i
saw
and
i
think
in
one
of
the
brighton
newspapers
a
paragraph
stating
that
b
who
had
taken
his
farms
into
hand
the
michaelmas
before
had
already
got
in
his
harvest
and
that
he
had
had
excellent
crops
this
was
a
sort
of
bragging
paragraph
and
there
was
an
observation
added
which
implied
that
the
farmers
were
great
fools
for
not
having
taken
the
farms
we
now
hear
that
b
has
let
his
farms
but
now
mark
how
he
has
let
them
the
custom
in
sussex
is
this
when
a
tenant
quits
a
farm
he
receives
payment
according
to
valuation
for
what
are
called
the
dressings
the
for
seeds
and
lays
and
for
the
growth
of
underwood
in
coppices
and
for
the
dung
in
the
yards
and
in
short
for
whatever
he
leaves
behind
him
which
if
he
had
stayed
would
have
been
of
value
to
him
the
dressings
and
include
not
only
the
manure
that
has
been
recently
put
into
the
land
but
also
the
summer
ploughings
and
in
short
everything
which
has
been
done
to
the
land
and
the
benefit
of
which
has
not
been
taken
out
again
by
the
farmer
this
is
a
good
custom
because
it
ensures
good
tillage
to
the
land
it
ensures
also
a
fair
start
to
the
new
tenant
but
then
observe
it
requires
some
money
which
the
new
tenant
must
pay
down
before
he
can
begin
and
therefore
this
custom
presumes
a
pretty
deal
of
capital
to
be
possessed
by
farmers
bearing
general
remarks
in
mind
we
shall
see
in
a
moment
the
case
of
b
if
my
information
be
correct
he
has
let
his
farms
he
has
found
tenants
for
his
farms
but
not
tenants
to
pay
him
anything
for
dressings
and
the
rest
he
was
obliged
to
pay
the
tenants
for
these
things
mind
that
he
was
obliged
to
pay
them
according
to
the
custom
of
the
country
but
he
has
got
nothing
of
this
sort
from
his
tenants
it
must
be
a
poor
farm
indeed
where
the
valuation
does
not
amount
to
some
hundreds
of
pounds
so
that
here
is
a
pretty
sum
sunk
by
b
and
yet
even
on
conditions
like
these
he
has
i
dare
say
been
glad
to
get
his
farms
off
his
hands
there
can
be
very
little
security
for
the
payment
of
rent
where
the
tenant
pays
no
but
even
if
he
get
no
rent
at
all
b
has
done
well
to
get
his
farms
off
his
hands
now
do
i
wish
to
insinuate
that
b
asked
too
much
for
his
farms
last
year
and
that
he
wished
to
squeeze
the
last
shilling
out
of
his
farmers
by
no
means
he
bears
the
character
of
a
mild
just
and
very
considerate
man
by
no
means
greedy
but
the
contrary
a
man
very
much
beloved
by
his
tenants
or
at
least
deserving
it
but
the
truth
is
he
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
his
farms
were
so
much
fallen
in
value
he
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
his
estate
had
been
taken
away
from
him
by
the
legerdemain
of
the
pitt
system
which
he
had
been
supporting
all
his
life
so
that
he
thought
and
very
naturally
thought
that
his
old
tenants
were
endeavouring
to
impose
upon
him
and
therefore
resolved
to
take
his
farms
into
hand
experience
has
shown
him
that
farms
yield
no
rent
in
the
hands
of
the
landlord
at
least
and
therefore
he
has
put
them
into
the
hands
of
other
people
b
like
western
has
not
read
the
if
he
had
he
would
have
taken
any
trifle
from
his
old
tenants
rather
than
let
them
go
but
he
surely
might
have
read
the
speech
of
his
neighbour
and
friend
huskisson
made
in
the
house
of
commons
in
in
which
that
gentleman
said
that
with
wheat
at
less
than
double
the
price
that
it
bore
before
the
war
it
would
be
impossible
for
any
rent
at
all
to
be
paid
b
might
have
read
this
and
he
might
having
so
many
opportunities
have
asked
huskisson
for
an
explanation
of
it
this
gentleman
is
now
a
great
advocate
for
but
may
not
b
ask
him
whether
there
be
no
faith
to
be
kept
with
the
landlord
however
if
i
am
not
deceived
b
or
sir
charles
b
for
i
really
do
not
know
which
it
is
is
a
member
of
the
collective
if
this
be
the
case
he
has
had
something
to
do
with
the
thing
himself
and
he
must
muster
up
as
much
as
he
can
of
that
patience
which
is
so
strongly
recommended
by
our
great
new
state
doctor
canning
i
can
not
conclude
my
remarks
on
this
rural
ride
without
noticing
the
new
sort
of
language
that
i
hear
everywhere
made
use
of
with
regard
to
the
parsons
but
which
language
i
do
not
care
to
repeat
these
men
may
say
that
i
keep
company
with
none
but
those
who
utter
sedition
and
blasphemy
and
if
they
do
say
so
there
is
just
as
much
veracity
in
their
words
as
i
believe
there
to
be
charity
and
sincerity
in
the
hearts
of
the
greater
part
of
them
one
thing
is
certain
indeed
two
things
the
first
is
that
almost
the
whole
of
the
persons
that
i
have
conversed
with
are
farmers
and
the
second
is
that
they
are
in
this
respect
all
of
one
mind
it
was
my
intention
at
one
time
to
go
along
the
south
of
hampshire
to
portsmouth
fareham
botley
southampton
and
across
the
new
forest
into
dorsetshire
my
affairs
made
me
turn
from
hambledon
this
way
but
i
had
an
opportunity
of
hearing
something
about
the
neighbourhood
of
botley
take
any
one
considerable
circle
where
you
know
everybody
and
the
condition
of
that
circle
will
teach
you
how
to
judge
pretty
correctly
of
the
condition
of
every
other
part
of
the
country
i
asked
about
the
farmers
of
my
old
neighbourhood
one
by
one
and
the
answers
i
received
only
tended
to
confirm
me
in
the
opinion
that
the
whole
race
will
be
destroyed
and
that
a
new
race
will
come
and
enter
upon
farms
without
capital
and
without
stock
be
a
sort
of
bailiffs
to
the
landlords
for
a
while
and
then
if
this
system
go
on
bailiffs
to
the
government
as
trustee
for
the
fundholders
if
the
account
which
i
have
received
of
b
new
mode
of
letting
be
true
here
is
one
step
further
than
has
been
before
taken
in
all
probability
the
stock
upon
the
farms
belongs
to
him
to
be
paid
for
when
the
tenant
can
pay
for
it
who
does
not
see
to
what
this
tends
the
man
must
be
blind
indeed
who
can
not
see
confiscation
here
and
can
he
be
much
less
than
blind
if
he
imagine
that
relief
is
to
be
obtained
by
the
recommended
by
canning
thus
sir
have
i
led
you
about
the
country
all
sorts
of
things
have
i
talked
of
to
be
sure
but
there
are
very
few
of
these
things
which
have
not
their
interest
of
one
sort
or
another
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
miles
or
two
of
travelling
stopping
here
and
there
talking
freely
with
everybody
hearing
what
gentlemen
farmers
tradesmen
journeymen
labourers
women
girls
boys
and
all
have
to
say
reasoning
with
some
laughing
with
others
and
observing
all
that
passes
and
especially
if
your
manner
be
such
as
to
remove
every
kind
of
reserve
from
every
class
at
the
end
of
a
tramp
like
this
you
get
impressed
upon
your
mind
a
true
picture
not
only
of
the
state
of
the
country
but
of
the
state
of
the
people
minds
throughout
the
country
and
sir
whether
you
believe
me
or
not
i
have
to
tell
you
that
it
is
my
decided
opinion
that
the
people
high
and
low
with
one
unanimous
voice
except
where
they
live
upon
the
taxes
their
calamities
to
the
house
of
whether
they
be
right
or
wrong
is
not
so
much
the
question
in
this
case
that
such
is
the
fact
i
am
certain
and
having
no
power
to
make
any
change
myself
i
must
leave
the
making
or
the
refusing
of
the
change
to
those
who
have
the
power
i
repeat
and
with
perfect
sincerity
that
it
would
give
me
as
much
pain
as
it
would
give
to
any
man
in
england
to
see
a
change
the
form
of
the
with
and
this
nation
enjoyed
many
ages
of
happiness
and
of
glory
my
opinion
is
it
never
can
again
see
anything
but
misery
and
shame
and
when
i
say
commons
i
commons
and
by
commons
i
mean
men
elected
by
the
free
voice
of
the
untitled
and
unprivileged
part
of
the
people
who
in
fact
as
well
as
in
law
are
the
commons
of
england
i
am
sir
your
most
obedient
and
most
humble
servant
wm
cobbett
journal
ride
from
kensington
to
worth
in
sussex
may
from
london
to
reigate
through
sutton
is
about
as
villanous
a
tract
as
england
contains
the
soil
is
a
mixture
of
gravel
and
clay
with
big
yellow
stones
in
it
sure
sign
of
really
bad
land
before
you
descend
the
hill
to
go
into
reigate
you
pass
gatton
and
old
sarum
which
is
a
very
rascally
spot
of
earth
the
trees
are
here
a
week
later
than
they
are
at
tooting
at
reigate
they
are
in
order
to
save
a
few
hundred
yards
length
of
road
cutting
through
a
hill
they
have
lowered
a
little
hill
on
the
london
side
of
sutton
thus
is
the
money
of
the
country
actually
thrown
away
the
produce
of
labour
is
taken
from
the
industrious
and
given
to
the
idlers
mark
the
process
the
town
of
brighton
in
sussex
miles
from
the
wen
is
on
the
seaside
and
is
thought
by
the
to
afford
a
it
is
so
situated
that
a
coach
which
leaves
it
not
very
early
in
the
morning
reaches
london
by
noon
and
starting
to
go
back
in
two
hours
and
a
half
afterwards
reaches
brighton
not
very
late
at
night
great
parcels
of
stay
at
brighton
with
the
women
and
children
they
skip
backward
and
forward
on
the
coaches
and
actually
carry
on
in
alley
though
they
reside
at
brighton
this
place
is
besides
a
place
of
great
resort
with
the
gentry
there
are
not
less
than
about
twenty
coaches
that
leave
the
wen
every
day
for
this
place
and
there
being
three
or
four
different
roads
there
is
a
great
rivalship
for
the
custom
this
sets
the
people
to
work
to
shorten
and
to
level
the
roads
and
here
you
see
hundreds
of
men
and
horses
constantly
at
work
to
make
pleasant
and
quick
travelling
for
the
jews
and
jobbers
the
jews
and
jobbers
pay
the
turnpikes
to
be
sure
but
they
get
the
money
from
the
land
and
labourer
they
drain
these
from
house
to
the
land
end
and
they
lay
out
some
of
the
money
on
the
brighton
roads
vast
as
said
to
in
speaking
of
the
new
enclosures
on
the
villanous
heaths
of
bagshot
and
now
some
will
say
well
it
is
only
a
change
from
hand
to
hand
very
true
and
if
daddy
coke
of
norfolk
like
the
change
i
know
not
why
i
should
dislike
it
more
and
more
new
houses
are
building
as
you
leave
the
wen
to
come
on
this
road
the
means
of
building
these
new
houses
and
keeping
the
inhabitants
do
they
come
out
of
and
oh
no
they
come
from
but
if
daddy
coke
like
this
what
has
any
one
else
to
do
with
it
daddy
coke
and
lord
milton
like
national
faith
it
would
be
a
pity
to
disappoint
their
liking
the
best
of
this
is
it
will
bring
to
the
very
it
will
bring
down
their
faces
to
the
very
earth
and
fill
their
mouths
full
of
sand
it
will
thus
pull
down
a
set
of
the
basest
of
power
and
the
most
intolerable
tyrants
towards
their
inferiors
in
wealth
that
the
sun
ever
shone
on
it
is
time
that
these
degenerate
dogs
were
swept
away
at
any
rate
the
blackthorns
are
in
full
bloom
and
make
a
grand
show
when
you
quit
reigate
to
go
towards
crawley
you
enter
on
what
is
called
the
of
it
is
a
level
country
and
the
soil
is
a
very
very
strong
loam
with
clay
beneath
to
a
great
depth
the
fields
are
small
and
about
a
third
of
the
land
covered
with
and
this
is
a
country
of
wheat
and
beans
the
latter
of
which
are
about
three
inches
high
the
former
about
seven
and
both
looking
very
well
i
did
not
see
a
field
of
wheat
from
foot
to
crawley
nor
from
crawley
across
to
this
place
where
though
the
whole
country
is
but
poorish
the
wheat
looks
very
well
and
if
this
weather
hold
about
twelve
days
we
shall
recover
the
lost
time
they
have
been
stripping
trees
taking
the
bark
off
about
five
or
six
days
the
nightingales
sing
very
much
which
is
a
sign
of
warm
weather
the
and
the
swallows
are
come
in
abundance
and
they
seldom
do
come
until
the
weather
be
set
in
for
mild
the
weather
is
very
fine
and
warm
the
leaves
of
the
are
coming
out
very
fast
some
of
the
trees
are
nearly
in
the
are
out
in
leaf
i
do
not
think
that
i
ever
saw
the
wheat
look
take
it
all
together
so
well
as
it
does
at
this
time
i
see
in
the
stiff
land
no
signs
of
worm
or
slug
the
winter
which
destroyed
so
many
turnips
must
at
any
rate
have
destroyed
these
mischievous
things
the
oats
look
well
the
barley
is
very
young
but
i
do
not
see
anything
amiss
with
regard
to
the
land
between
this
place
and
reigate
is
stiff
how
the
corn
may
be
in
other
places
i
know
not
but
in
coming
down
i
met
with
a
farmer
of
bedfordshire
who
said
that
the
wheat
looked
very
well
in
that
county
which
is
not
a
county
of
clay
like
the
weald
of
surrey
i
saw
a
southdown
farmer
who
told
me
that
the
wheat
is
good
there
and
that
is
a
fine
the
bloom
of
the
fruit
trees
is
the
finest
i
ever
saw
in
england
the
is
at
a
distance
like
that
of
the
so
large
and
bold
are
the
bunches
the
plum
is
equally
fine
and
even
the
blackthorn
which
is
the
has
a
bloom
finer
than
i
ever
saw
it
have
before
it
is
rather
to
offer
any
opinion
as
to
the
crop
of
corn
but
if
i
were
compelled
to
bet
upon
it
i
would
bet
upon
a
good
crop
frosts
frequently
come
after
this
time
and
if
they
come
in
may
they
cause
things
to
come
about
very
fast
but
if
we
have
no
more
frosts
in
short
if
we
have
after
this
a
good
summer
we
shall
have
a
fine
laugh
at
the
quakers
and
the
press
fifteen
days
sun
will
bring
in
reality
the
wages
of
labour
in
the
country
have
taken
a
rise
and
the
an
increase
since
first
of
march
i
am
glad
to
hear
that
the
affair
has
excited
a
good
deal
of
attention
in
answer
to
applications
upon
the
subject
i
have
to
observe
that
all
the
information
on
the
subject
will
be
published
in
the
first
week
of
june
specimens
of
the
and
will
then
be
to
be
seen
at
no
fleet
street
from
the
london
wen
across
surrey
across
the
west
of
sussex
and
into
the
south
east
of
hampshire
surrey
saturday
july
came
from
the
wen
through
croydon
it
rained
nearly
all
the
way
the
corn
is
good
a
great
deal
of
straw
the
barley
very
fine
but
all
are
backward
and
if
this
weather
continue
much
longer
there
must
be
that
heavenly
blight
for
which
the
wise
friends
of
social
order
are
so
fervently
praying
but
if
the
wet
now
cease
or
cease
soon
what
is
to
become
of
the
poor
souls
of
farmers
god
only
knows
in
one
article
the
wishes
of
our
wise
government
appear
to
have
been
gratified
to
the
utmost
and
that
too
without
the
aid
of
any
express
form
of
prayer
i
allude
to
the
hops
of
which
it
is
said
that
there
will
be
according
to
all
appearance
none
at
all
bravo
courage
my
lord
liverpool
this
article
at
any
rate
will
not
choak
us
will
not
distress
us
will
not
make
us
miserable
by
the
other
day
a
gentleman
and
a
man
of
general
good
sense
too
said
to
me
what
a
deal
of
wet
we
have
what
do
you
think
of
the
weather
more
rain
said
i
d
n
those
farmers
said
he
what
luck
they
have
they
will
be
as
rich
as
jews
incredible
as
this
may
seem
it
is
a
fact
but
indeed
there
is
no
folly
if
it
relate
to
these
matters
which
is
incredible
the
hop
affair
is
a
pretty
good
illustration
of
the
doctrine
of
relief
from
diminished
production
ricardo
may
now
call
upon
any
of
the
for
proof
of
the
correctness
of
his
notions
they
are
ruined
for
the
greater
part
if
their
all
be
embarked
in
hops
how
are
they
to
pay
rent
i
saw
a
planter
the
other
day
who
sold
his
hops
kentish
last
fall
for
sixty
shillings
a
hundred
the
same
hops
will
now
fetch
the
owner
of
them
eight
pounds
or
a
hundred
and
sixty
shillings
thus
the
gets
rich
and
the
poor
devil
of
a
farmer
is
squeezed
into
a
gaol
the
carry
on
the
far
greater
part
of
this
work
they
are
as
to
the
products
of
the
earth
what
the
are
as
to
gold
and
silver
how
they
profit
or
rather
the
degree
in
which
they
profit
at
the
expense
of
those
who
own
and
those
who
till
the
land
may
be
guessed
at
if
we
look
at
their
immense
worth
and
if
we
at
the
same
time
reflect
that
they
never
work
here
is
a
sect
of
one
would
think
that
their
religion
bound
them
under
a
curse
not
to
work
some
part
of
the
people
of
all
other
sects
work
sweat
at
work
do
something
that
is
useful
to
other
people
but
here
is
a
sect
of
buyers
and
sellers
they
make
nothing
they
cause
nothing
to
come
they
breed
as
well
as
other
sects
but
they
make
none
of
the
raiment
or
houses
and
cause
none
of
the
food
to
come
in
order
to
justify
some
measure
for
paring
the
nails
of
this
grasping
sect
it
is
enough
to
say
of
them
which
we
may
with
perfect
truth
that
if
all
the
other
sects
were
to
act
like
them
community
must
this
is
quite
enough
to
say
of
this
sect
of
the
monstrous
privileges
of
whom
we
shall
i
hope
one
of
these
days
see
an
end
if
i
had
the
dealing
with
them
i
would
soon
teach
them
to
use
the
and
the
and
the
too
when
necessary
the
rye
along
the
road
side
is
ripe
enough
and
some
of
it
is
reaped
and
in
shock
at
mearstam
there
is
a
field
of
cabbages
which
i
was
told
belonged
to
colonel
joliffe
they
appear
to
be
early
yorks
and
look
very
well
the
rows
seem
to
be
about
eighteen
inches
apart
there
may
be
from
to
plants
to
the
acre
and
i
dare
say
that
they
will
weigh
three
pounds
each
or
more
i
know
of
no
crop
of
cattle
food
equal
to
this
if
they
be
early
yorks
they
will
be
in
perfection
in
october
just
when
the
grass
is
almost
gone
no
five
acres
of
common
grass
land
will
during
the
year
yield
cattle
food
equal
either
in
quantity
or
quality
to
what
one
acre
of
land
in
early
yorks
will
produce
during
three
months
sussex
wednesday
worth
is
ten
miles
from
reigate
on
the
which
goes
through
horley
reigate
has
the
surrey
chalk
hills
close
to
it
on
the
north
and
along
on
its
south
and
nearly
close
to
it
also
as
soon
as
you
are
over
the
you
come
into
a
country
of
clay
and
this
is
called
the
of
surrey
this
weald
winds
away
round
towards
the
west
into
sussex
and
towards
the
east
into
kent
in
this
part
of
surrey
it
is
about
eight
miles
wide
from
north
to
south
and
ends
just
as
you
enter
the
parish
of
worth
which
is
the
first
parish
in
this
part
in
the
county
of
sussex
all
across
the
weald
the
strong
and
stiff
clays
the
corn
looks
very
well
i
found
it
looking
well
from
the
wen
to
reigate
on
the
villanous
spewy
soil
between
the
wen
and
croydon
on
the
chalk
from
croydon
to
near
reigate
on
the
loam
sand
and
chalk
for
there
are
all
three
in
the
valley
of
reigate
but
not
quite
so
well
on
the
sand
on
the
clay
all
the
corn
looks
well
the
wheat
where
it
has
begun
to
die
is
dying
of
a
good
colour
not
black
nor
in
any
way
that
indicates
blight
it
is
however
all
backward
some
few
fields
of
white
wheat
are
changing
colour
but
for
the
greater
part
it
is
quite
green
and
though
a
sudden
change
of
weather
might
make
a
great
alteration
in
a
short
time
it
does
appear
that
the
harvest
must
be
later
than
usual
when
i
say
this
however
i
by
no
means
wish
to
be
understood
as
saying
that
it
must
be
so
late
as
to
be
injurious
to
the
crop
in
i
saw
a
making
in
november
in
i
saw
wheat
uncut
in
suffolk
in
october
if
we
were
now
to
have
good
bright
hot
weather
for
as
long
a
time
as
we
have
had
wet
the
whole
of
the
corn
in
these
southern
counties
would
be
housed
and
great
part
of
it
threshed
out
by
the
of
september
so
that
all
depends
on
the
weather
which
appears
to
be
clearing
up
in
spite
of
saint
swithin
this
saint
is
the
of
july
and
it
is
said
that
if
rain
fall
on
his
it
will
fall
on
successively
but
i
believe
that
you
reckon
retrospectively
as
well
as
prospectively
and
if
this
be
the
case
we
may
this
time
escape
the
extreme
unction
for
it
began
to
rain
on
the
of
june
so
that
it
rained
days
before
the
of
july
and
as
it
has
rained
days
since
it
has
rained
in
the
whole
days
and
of
course
five
days
more
will
satisfy
this
wet
soul
of
a
saint
let
him
take
his
five
days
and
there
will
be
plenty
of
time
for
us
to
have
wheat
at
four
shillings
a
bushel
but
if
the
saint
will
give
us
no
credit
for
the
days
and
will
insist
upon
his
forty
daily
drenchings
the
fifteenth
of
july
if
he
will
have
such
a
soaking
as
this
at
the
celebration
of
the
anniversary
of
his
birth
let
us
hope
that
he
is
prepared
with
a
miracle
for
feeding
us
and
with
a
still
more
potent
miracle
for
keeping
the
farmers
from
riding
over
us
filled
as
lord
liverpool
thinks
their
pockets
will
be
by
the
annihilation
of
their
crops
the
upland
meadow
grass
is
a
great
deal
of
it
not
cut
yet
along
the
weald
so
that
in
these
parts
there
has
been
not
a
great
deal
of
hay
spoiled
the
clover
hay
was
got
in
very
well
and
only
a
small
part
of
the
meadow
hay
has
been
spoiled
in
this
part
of
the
country
this
is
not
the
case
however
in
other
parts
where
the
grass
was
forwarder
and
where
it
was
cut
before
the
rain
came
upon
the
whole
however
much
hay
does
not
appear
to
have
been
spoiled
as
yet
the
farmers
along
here
have
most
of
them
begun
to
cut
this
has
been
a
fine
day
and
it
is
clear
that
they
expect
it
to
continue
i
saw
but
two
pieces
of
swedish
turnips
between
the
wen
and
reigate
but
one
at
reigate
and
but
one
between
reigate
and
worth
during
a
like
distance
in
norfolk
or
suffolk
you
would
see
two
or
three
hundred
fields
of
this
sort
of
root
those
that
i
do
see
here
look
well
the
white
turnips
are
just
up
or
just
sown
though
there
are
some
which
have
rough
leaves
already
this
weald
is
indeed
not
much
of
land
for
turnips
but
from
what
i
see
here
and
from
what
i
know
of
the
weather
i
think
that
the
turnips
must
be
generally
good
the
is
surprisingly
fine
the
lands
which
have
had
hay
cut
and
carried
from
them
are
i
think
more
than
i
ever
saw
them
before
it
should
however
always
be
borne
in
mind
that
this
grass
is
by
no
means
the
an
acre
of
this
grass
will
not
make
a
quarter
part
so
much
butter
as
an
acre
of
pasture
made
rusty
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
sheep
on
the
commons
of
the
grass
produced
by
rains
at
this
time
of
the
year
even
geese
hardy
as
they
are
die
from
the
same
cause
the
rain
will
give
quantity
but
without
sun
the
quality
must
be
poor
at
the
best
the
woods
have
not
shot
much
this
year
the
cold
winds
the
frosts
that
we
had
up
to
midsummer
prevented
the
trees
from
growing
much
they
are
beginning
to
shoot
now
but
the
wood
must
be
imperfectly
ripened
i
met
at
worth
a
beggar
who
told
me
in
consequence
of
my
asking
where
he
belonged
that
he
was
born
in
south
carolina
i
found
at
last
that
he
was
born
in
the
english
army
during
the
american
that
he
became
a
soldier
himself
and
that
it
had
been
his
fate
to
serve
under
the
duke
of
york
in
holland
under
general
whitelock
at
buenos
ayres
under
sir
john
moore
at
corunna
and
under
the
greatest
captain
at
talavera
this
poor
fellow
did
not
seem
to
be
at
all
aware
that
in
the
last
case
he
partook
in
he
had
never
before
heard
of
its
being
a
victory
he
poor
fool
thought
that
it
was
why
said
he
we
sir
oh
yes
said
i
and
so
you
did
afterwards
perhaps
in
portugal
when
massena
was
at
your
heels
but
it
is
only
in
certain
cases
that
running
away
is
a
mark
of
being
defeated
or
rather
it
is
only
with
certain
commanders
a
matter
of
much
more
interest
to
us
however
is
that
the
wars
for
social
order
not
forgetting
gatton
and
old
sarum
have
filled
the
country
with
beggars
who
have
been
or
who
pretend
to
have
been
soldiers
and
sailors
for
want
of
looking
well
into
this
matter
many
good
and
just
and
even
sensible
men
are
led
to
give
to
these
army
and
navy
beggars
what
they
refuse
to
others
but
if
reason
were
consulted
she
would
ask
what
pretensions
these
have
to
a
preference
she
would
see
in
them
men
who
had
become
soldiers
or
sailors
because
they
wished
to
live
without
that
labour
by
which
other
men
are
content
to
get
their
bread
she
would
ask
the
soldier
beggar
whether
he
did
not
voluntarily
engage
to
perform
services
such
as
were
performed
at
manchester
and
if
she
pressed
him
for
to
this
engagement
could
he
assign
any
motive
other
than
that
of
wishing
to
live
without
work
upon
the
fruit
of
the
work
of
other
men
and
why
should
reason
not
be
listened
to
why
should
she
not
be
consulted
in
every
such
case
and
if
she
were
consulted
which
would
she
tell
you
was
the
most
worthy
of
your
compassion
the
man
who
no
matter
from
what
cause
is
become
a
beggar
after
forty
years
spent
in
the
raising
of
food
and
raiment
for
others
as
well
as
for
himself
or
the
man
who
no
matter
again
from
what
cause
is
become
a
beggar
after
forty
years
living
upon
the
labour
of
others
and
during
the
greater
part
of
which
time
he
has
been
living
in
a
barrack
there
kept
for
purposes
explained
by
lord
palmerston
and
always
in
readiness
to
answer
those
purposes
as
to
not
giving
to
beggars
i
think
there
is
a
law
against
giving
however
give
to
them
people
will
as
long
as
they
ask
remove
the
of
the
beggary
and
we
shall
see
no
more
beggars
but
as
long
as
there
are
there
will
be
beggars
enough
sussex
thursday
i
left
worth
this
afternoon
about
and
am
got
here
to
sleep
intending
to
set
off
for
petworth
in
the
morning
with
a
view
of
crossing
the
south
downs
and
then
going
into
hampshire
through
havant
and
along
at
the
southern
foot
of
portsdown
hill
where
i
shall
see
the
earliest
corn
in
england
from
worth
you
come
to
crawley
along
some
pretty
good
land
you
then
turn
to
the
left
and
go
two
miles
along
the
road
from
the
wen
to
brighton
then
you
turn
to
the
right
and
go
over
six
of
the
worst
miles
in
england
which
miles
terminate
but
a
few
hundred
yards
before
you
enter
horsham
the
first
two
of
these
miserable
miles
go
through
the
estate
of
lord
erskine
it
was
a
bare
heath
with
here
and
there
in
the
better
parts
of
it
some
scrubby
birch
it
has
been
in
part
planted
with
which
are
as
ugly
as
the
heath
was
and
in
short
it
is
a
most
villanous
tract
after
quitting
it
you
enter
a
forest
but
a
most
miserable
one
and
this
is
followed
by
a
large
common
now
enclosed
cut
up
disfigured
spoiled
and
the
labourers
all
driven
from
its
skirts
i
have
seldom
travelled
over
eight
miles
so
well
calculated
to
fill
the
mind
with
painful
reflections
the
ride
has
however
this
in
it
that
the
ground
is
pretty
much
elevated
and
enables
you
to
look
about
you
you
see
the
surrey
hills
away
to
the
north
hindhead
and
blackdown
to
the
north
west
and
west
and
the
south
downs
from
the
west
to
the
east
the
sun
was
shining
upon
all
these
though
it
was
cloudy
where
i
was
the
soil
is
a
poor
miserable
sand
with
a
sort
of
sandstone
underneath
when
you
get
down
into
this
town
you
are
again
in
the
weald
of
sussex
i
believe
that
meant
or
low
wet
stiff
land
this
is
a
very
nice
solid
country
town
very
clean
as
all
the
towns
in
sussex
are
the
people
very
clean
the
sussex
women
are
very
nice
in
their
dress
and
in
their
houses
the
men
and
boys
wear
more
than
they
do
in
some
counties
when
country
people
do
not
they
always
look
dirty
and
comfortless
this
has
been
a
pretty
good
day
but
there
was
a
little
rain
in
the
afternoon
so
that
swithin
keeps
on
as
yet
at
any
rate
the
hay
has
been
spoiled
here
in
cases
where
it
has
been
cut
but
a
great
deal
of
it
is
not
yet
cut
i
speak
of
the
meadows
for
the
was
all
well
got
in
the
grass
which
is
not
cut
is
receiving
great
injury
it
is
in
fact
in
many
cases
rotting
upon
the
ground
as
to
corn
from
crawley
to
horsham
there
is
none
worth
speaking
of
what
there
is
is
very
good
in
general
considering
the
quality
of
the
soil
it
is
about
as
backward
as
at
worth
the
barley
and
oats
green
and
the
wheat
beginning
to
change
colour
sussex
friday
morning
this
village
is
miles
from
horsham
and
i
got
here
to
breakfast
about
seven
a
very
pretty
village
and
a
very
nice
breakfast
in
a
very
neat
little
parlour
of
a
very
decent
the
landlady
sent
her
son
to
get
me
some
cream
and
he
was
just
such
a
chap
as
i
was
at
his
age
and
dressed
just
in
the
same
sort
of
way
his
main
garment
being
a
blue
faded
from
wear
and
mended
with
pieces
of
new
stuff
and
of
course
not
faded
the
sight
of
this
brought
to
my
recollection
many
things
very
dear
to
me
this
boy
will
i
dare
say
perform
his
part
at
billingshurst
or
at
some
place
not
far
from
it
if
accident
had
not
taken
me
from
a
similar
scene
how
many
villains
and
fools
who
have
been
well
teazed
and
tormented
would
have
slept
in
peace
at
night
and
have
fearlessly
swaggered
about
by
day
when
i
look
at
this
little
chap
at
his
his
nailed
shoes
and
his
clean
plain
and
coarse
shirt
i
ask
myself
will
anything
i
wonder
ever
send
this
chap
across
the
ocean
to
tackle
the
base
corrupt
perjured
republican
judges
of
pennsylvania
will
this
little
lively
but
at
the
same
time
simple
boy
ever
become
the
terror
of
villains
and
hypocrites
across
the
atlantic
what
a
chain
of
strange
circumstances
there
must
be
to
lead
this
boy
to
thwart
a
miscreant
tyrant
like
mackeen
the
chief
justice
and
afterwards
governor
of
pennsylvania
and
to
expose
the
corruptions
of
the
band
of
rascals
called
a
senate
and
a
house
of
representatives
at
harrisburgh
in
that
state
i
was
afraid
of
rain
and
got
on
as
fast
as
i
could
that
is
to
say
as
fast
as
my
own
diligence
could
help
me
on
for
as
to
my
horse
he
is
to
go
only
however
i
had
no
rain
and
got
to
petworth
nine
miles
further
by
about
ten
sussex
friday
evening
no
rain
until
just
at
sunset
and
then
very
little
i
must
now
look
back
from
horsham
to
within
a
few
miles
of
petworth
is
in
the
weald
of
sussex
stiff
land
small
fields
broad
and
invariably
thickly
planted
with
fine
growing
oak
trees
the
corn
here
consists
chiefly
of
wheat
and
oats
there
are
some
and
some
few
fields
of
peas
but
very
little
barley
along
here
the
corn
is
very
good
all
along
the
weald
backward
the
wheat
almost
green
the
oats
quite
green
but
late
as
it
is
i
see
no
blight
and
the
farmers
tell
me
that
there
is
no
blight
there
may
be
yet
however
and
therefore
our
government
our
government
so
anxious
to
prevent
over
production
need
not
as
yet
at
any
rate
the
beans
in
the
weald
are
not
very
good
they
got
lousy
before
the
wet
came
and
it
came
rather
too
late
to
make
them
recover
what
they
had
lost
what
peas
there
are
look
well
along
here
the
wheat
in
general
may
be
fit
to
cut
in
about
days
time
some
sooner
but
some
later
for
some
is
perfectly
green
no
swedish
turnips
all
along
this
country
the
white
turnips
are
just
up
coming
up
or
just
sown
the
farmers
are
laying
out
lime
upon
the
wheat
fallows
and
this
is
the
universal
practice
of
the
country
i
see
very
few
sheep
there
are
a
good
many
orchards
along
in
the
weald
and
they
have
some
apples
this
year
but
in
general
not
many
the
apple
trees
are
planted
very
thickly
and
of
course
they
are
small
but
they
appear
healthy
in
general
and
in
some
places
there
is
a
good
deal
of
fruit
even
this
year
as
you
approach
petworth
the
ground
rises
and
the
soil
grows
lighter
there
is
a
hill
which
i
came
over
about
two
miles
from
petworth
whence
i
had
a
clear
view
of
the
surrey
leithhill
hindhead
blackdown
and
of
the
south
downs
towards
one
part
of
which
i
was
advancing
the
pigs
along
here
are
all
black
and
of
precisely
the
same
sort
of
those
that
i
took
from
england
to
long
island
and
with
which
i
pretty
well
stocked
the
american
states
the
trip
which
old
sidmouth
and
crew
gave
me
to
america
was
attended
with
some
interesting
consequences
amongst
which
were
the
introducing
of
the
sussex
pigs
into
the
american
farmyards
the
introduction
of
the
swedish
turnip
into
the
american
fields
the
introduction
of
american
apple
trees
into
england
and
the
introduction
of
the
making
in
england
of
the
straw
plat
to
supplant
the
italian
for
had
my
son
not
been
in
america
this
last
would
not
have
taken
place
and
in
america
he
would
not
have
been
had
it
not
been
for
old
sidmouth
and
crew
one
thing
more
and
that
is
of
more
importance
than
all
the
rest
peel
bill
arose
out
of
the
registers
these
arose
out
of
the
trip
to
long
island
and
out
of
bill
has
arisen
the
best
bothering
that
the
wigs
of
the
boroughmongers
ever
received
which
bothering
will
end
in
the
destruction
of
the
boroughmongering
it
is
curious
and
very
thus
to
trace
events
to
their
causes
soon
after
quitting
billingshurst
i
crossed
the
river
arun
which
has
a
canal
running
alongside
of
it
at
this
there
are
large
timber
and
coal
yards
and
kilns
for
lime
this
appears
to
be
a
grand
receiving
and
distributing
place
the
river
goes
down
to
arundale
and
together
with
the
valley
that
it
runs
through
gives
the
town
its
name
this
valley
which
is
very
pretty
and
which
winds
about
a
good
deal
is
the
dale
of
the
arun
and
the
town
is
the
town
of
the
near
a
place
called
westborough
green
i
saw
a
woman
bleaching
her
and
linen
i
have
not
seen
such
a
thing
before
since
i
left
long
island
there
and
indeed
all
over
the
american
states
north
of
maryland
and
especially
in
the
new
england
states
almost
the
whole
of
both
linen
and
woollen
used
in
the
country
and
a
large
part
of
that
used
in
towns
is
made
in
the
farmhouses
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
families
who
never
use
either
except
of
their
own
making
all
but
the
weaving
is
done
by
the
family
there
is
a
loom
in
the
house
and
the
weaver
goes
from
house
to
house
i
once
saw
about
three
thousand
farmers
or
rather
country
people
at
a
in
long
island
and
my
opinion
was
that
there
were
not
five
hundred
who
were
not
dressed
in
coats
as
to
linen
no
farmer
family
thinks
of
buying
linen
the
lords
of
the
loom
have
taken
from
the
land
in
england
this
part
of
its
due
and
hence
one
cause
of
the
poverty
misery
and
pauperism
that
are
becoming
so
frightful
throughout
the
country
a
national
debt
and
all
the
taxation
and
gambling
belonging
to
it
have
a
natural
tendency
to
draw
wealth
into
great
masses
these
masses
produce
a
power
of
manufactures
and
of
making
the
many
work
at
them
for
the
of
a
the
taxing
government
finds
great
convenience
in
these
congregations
it
can
lay
its
hand
easily
upon
a
part
of
the
produce
as
ours
does
with
so
much
effect
but
the
land
suffers
greatly
from
this
and
the
country
must
finally
feel
the
fatal
effects
of
it
the
country
people
lose
part
of
their
natural
employment
the
women
and
children
who
ought
to
provide
a
great
part
of
the
raiment
have
nothing
to
do
the
fields
have
men
and
boys
but
where
there
are
men
and
boys
there
will
be
and
and
as
the
lords
of
the
loom
have
now
a
set
of
real
slaves
by
the
means
of
whom
they
take
away
a
great
part
of
the
employment
of
the
countrywomen
and
girls
these
must
be
kept
by
in
whatever
degree
they
lose
employment
through
the
lords
of
the
loom
one
would
think
that
nothing
can
be
much
plainer
than
this
and
yet
you
hear
the
congratulating
one
another
upon
the
increase
of
manchester
and
such
places
my
straw
affair
will
certainly
restore
to
the
land
some
of
the
employment
of
its
women
and
girls
it
will
be
impossible
for
any
of
the
rich
ruffians
any
of
the
or
or
ruffians
any
of
these
greedy
grinding
ruffians
to
draw
together
bands
of
men
women
and
children
and
to
make
them
slaves
in
the
working
of
straw
the
raw
material
comes
of
itself
and
the
hand
and
the
hand
alone
can
convert
it
to
use
i
thought
well
of
this
before
i
took
one
single
step
in
the
way
of
supplanting
the
leghorn
bonnets
if
i
had
not
been
certain
that
no
rich
ruffian
no
white
slave
holder
could
ever
arise
out
of
it
assuredly
one
line
upon
the
subject
never
would
have
been
written
by
me
better
a
million
times
that
the
money
should
go
to
italy
better
that
it
should
go
to
enrich
even
the
rivals
and
enemies
of
the
country
than
that
it
should
enable
these
hard
these
unfeeling
men
to
draw
english
people
into
crowds
and
make
them
slaves
and
slaves
too
of
the
lowest
and
most
degraded
cast
as
i
was
coming
into
this
town
i
saw
a
sort
of
a
man
had
a
and
was
cracking
the
heads
of
the
big
stones
that
had
been
laid
on
the
road
a
good
while
ago
this
is
a
very
good
way
but
this
man
told
me
that
he
was
set
at
this
because
the
farmers
had
for
many
of
the
men
well
said
i
but
they
pay
you
to
do
this
yes
said
he
well
then
said
i
is
it
not
better
for
them
to
pay
you
for
working
their
i
tell
indeed
sir
how
that
is
but
only
think
here
is
half
the
haymaking
to
do
i
saw
while
i
was
talking
to
this
man
fifty
people
in
one
of
lord
egremont
making
and
carrying
hay
and
yet
at
a
season
like
this
the
farmers
are
so
poor
as
to
be
unable
to
pay
the
labourers
to
work
on
the
land
from
this
cause
there
will
certainly
be
some
falling
off
in
production
this
will
of
course
have
a
tendency
to
keep
prices
from
falling
so
low
as
they
would
do
if
there
were
no
falling
off
but
can
this
the
farmer
and
landlord
the
poverty
of
the
farmers
is
seen
in
their
diminished
stock
the
animals
are
sold
than
formerly
last
year
was
a
year
of
great
slaughtering
there
will
be
less
of
everything
produced
and
the
quality
of
each
thing
will
be
worse
it
will
be
a
lower
and
more
mean
concern
altogether
petworth
is
a
nice
market
town
but
solid
and
clean
the
great
abundance
of
in
the
land
hereabouts
has
caused
a
corresponding
liberality
in
paving
and
wall
building
so
that
everything
of
the
building
kind
has
an
air
of
great
strength
and
produces
the
agreeable
idea
of
durability
lord
egremont
house
is
close
to
the
town
and
with
its
garden
walls
and
other
erections
is
perhaps
nearly
as
big
as
the
town
though
the
town
is
not
a
very
small
one
the
park
is
very
fine
and
consists
of
a
parcel
of
those
hills
and
dells
which
nature
formed
here
when
she
was
in
one
of
her
most
sportive
modes
i
have
never
seen
the
earth
flung
about
in
such
a
wild
way
as
round
about
hindhead
and
blackdown
and
this
park
forms
a
part
of
this
ground
from
an
elevated
part
of
it
and
indeed
from
each
of
many
parts
of
it
you
see
all
around
the
country
to
the
distance
of
many
miles
from
the
south
east
to
the
north
west
the
hills
are
so
lofty
and
so
near
that
they
cut
the
view
rather
short
but
for
the
rest
of
the
circle
you
can
see
to
a
very
great
distance
it
is
upon
the
whole
a
most
magnificent
seat
and
the
jews
will
not
be
able
to
get
it
from
the
owner
though
if
he
live
many
years
they
will
give
even
him
a
if
i
had
time
i
would
make
an
actual
survey
of
one
whole
county
and
find
out
how
many
of
the
old
gentry
have
lost
their
estates
and
have
been
supplanted
by
the
jews
since
pitt
began
his
reign
i
am
sure
i
should
prove
that
in
number
they
are
extinguished
but
it
is
that
they
go
the
little
ones
are
indeed
gone
and
the
rest
will
follow
in
proportion
as
the
present
farmers
are
exhausted
these
will
keep
on
giving
rents
as
long
as
they
can
beg
or
borrow
the
money
to
pay
rents
with
but
a
little
more
time
will
so
completely
exhaust
them
that
they
will
be
unable
to
pay
and
as
that
takes
place
the
landlords
will
lose
their
estates
indeed
many
of
them
and
even
a
large
portion
of
them
have
in
fact
no
estates
now
they
are
theirs
but
the
mortgagees
and
annuitants
receive
the
rents
as
the
rents
fall
off
sales
must
take
place
unless
in
cases
of
entails
and
if
this
thing
go
on
we
shall
see
acts
passed
to
off
in
order
that
the
jews
may
be
put
into
full
possession
such
thus
far
will
be
the
result
of
our
glorious
victories
over
the
french
such
will
be
in
part
the
price
of
the
deeds
of
pitt
addington
perceval
and
their
successors
for
having
applauded
such
deeds
for
having
boasted
of
the
wellesleys
for
having
bragged
of
battles
won
by
and
by
money
the
nation
deserves
that
which
it
will
receive
and
as
to
the
landlords
they
above
all
men
living
deserve
punishment
they
put
the
power
into
the
hands
of
pitt
and
his
crew
to
torment
the
people
to
keep
the
people
down
to
raise
soldiers
and
to
build
barracks
for
this
purpose
these
base
landlords
laughed
when
affairs
like
that
of
manchester
took
place
they
laughed
at
the
they
laughed
when
canning
jested
about
ogden
rupture
let
them
therefore
now
take
the
full
benefit
of
the
measures
of
pitt
and
his
crew
they
would
fain
have
us
believe
that
the
calamities
they
endure
do
not
arise
from
the
acts
of
the
government
what
do
they
arise
from
then
the
jacobins
did
not
contract
the
of
sterling
the
jacobins
did
not
create
a
of
the
jacobins
did
not
cause
a
of
by
means
of
new
enclosure
bills
vast
improvements
potatoes
and
other
proofs
of
prosperity
the
jacobins
did
not
do
these
things
and
will
the
government
pretend
that
providence
did
it
that
would
be
blasphemy
poh
these
things
are
the
price
of
efforts
to
crush
freedom
in
france
the
example
of
france
should
produce
a
reform
in
these
things
are
the
price
of
that
undertaking
which
however
has
not
yet
been
crowned
with
for
the
question
is
yet
they
boast
of
their
victory
over
the
french
the
pitt
crew
boast
of
their
achievements
in
the
war
they
boast
of
the
battle
of
waterloo
why
what
fools
could
not
get
the
same
or
the
like
if
they
had
as
much
to
get
it
with
shooting
with
a
is
a
saying
amongst
that
is
to
say
the
game
a
waddling
fat
fellow
that
does
not
know
how
to
prime
and
load
will
in
this
way
beat
the
best
shot
in
the
country
and
this
is
the
way
that
our
crew
beat
the
people
of
france
they
laid
out
in
the
first
place
six
hundred
millions
which
they
borrowed
and
for
which
they
mortgaged
the
revenues
of
the
nation
then
they
contracted
for
a
dead
weight
to
the
amount
of
one
hundred
and
fifty
millions
then
they
stripped
the
labouring
classes
of
the
commons
of
their
kettles
their
bedding
their
and
in
short
made
them
all
paupers
and
thus
fixed
on
the
nation
a
permanent
annual
charge
of
about
or
millions
or
a
gross
debt
of
by
these
means
by
these
anticipations
our
crew
did
what
they
thought
would
keep
down
the
french
nation
for
ages
and
what
they
were
sure
would
for
the
present
enable
them
to
keep
up
the
and
other
things
of
the
same
sort
in
england
but
the
crew
did
not
reflect
on
the
of
the
anticipations
or
at
least
the
landlords
who
gave
the
crew
their
power
did
not
thus
reflect
these
consequences
are
now
come
and
are
coming
and
that
must
be
a
base
man
indeed
who
does
not
see
them
with
pleasure
sussex
saturday
ever
since
the
middle
of
march
i
have
been
trying
remedies
for
the
and
have
i
believe
tried
everything
except
riding
wet
to
the
skin
two
or
three
hours
amongst
the
clouds
on
the
south
downs
this
remedy
is
now
under
trial
as
lord
liverpool
said
the
other
day
of
the
irish
tithe
bill
it
is
under
experiment
i
am
treating
my
disorder
with
better
success
i
hope
in
somewhat
the
same
way
that
the
pretty
fellows
at
whitehall
treat
the
disorders
of
poor
ireland
there
is
one
thing
in
favour
of
this
remedy
of
mine
i
shall
the
effect
of
it
and
that
too
in
a
short
time
it
rained
a
little
last
night
i
got
off
from
petworth
without
baiting
my
horse
thinking
that
the
weather
looked
suspicious
and
that
swithin
meaned
to
treat
me
to
a
dose
i
had
no
nor
any
means
of
changing
my
clothes
the
made
me
anxious
but
i
had
fixed
on
going
along
the
south
downs
from
donnington
hill
down
to
lavant
and
then
to
go
on
the
flat
to
the
south
foot
of
portsdown
hill
and
to
reach
fareham
two
men
whom
i
met
soon
after
i
set
off
assured
me
that
it
would
not
rain
i
came
on
to
donnington
which
lies
at
the
foot
of
that
part
of
the
south
downs
which
i
had
to
go
up
before
i
came
to
this
point
i
crossed
the
arun
and
its
canal
again
and
here
was
another
place
of
deposit
for
timber
lime
coals
and
other
things
white
in
his
history
of
selborne
mentions
a
hill
which
is
one
of
the
hindhead
group
from
which
two
springs
one
on
each
side
of
the
hill
send
water
into
the
the
and
the
this
is
big
talk
but
it
is
a
fact
one
of
the
streams
becomes
the
which
falls
into
the
channel
and
the
other
after
winding
along
amongst
the
hills
and
hillocks
between
hindhead
and
godalming
goes
into
the
river
which
falls
into
the
thames
at
weybridge
the
soil
upon
leaving
petworth
and
at
petworth
seems
very
good
a
fine
deep
loam
a
sort
of
mixture
of
sand
and
soft
chalk
i
then
came
to
a
sandy
common
a
piece
of
ground
that
seemed
to
have
no
business
there
it
looked
as
if
it
had
been
tossed
from
hindhead
or
blackdown
the
common
however
during
the
rage
for
improvements
has
been
that
impudent
fellow
old
rose
stated
the
number
of
enclosure
bills
as
an
indubitable
proof
of
national
prosperity
there
was
some
upon
this
common
the
sight
of
which
would
have
gladdened
the
heart
of
lord
liverpool
it
was
in
parts
not
more
than
eight
inches
high
it
was
ripe
and
of
course
the
straw
dead
or
i
should
have
found
out
the
owner
and
have
bought
it
to
make
of
i
defy
the
italians
to
grow
worse
rye
than
this
the
reader
will
recollect
that
i
always
said
that
we
could
grow
corn
as
any
italians
that
ever
lived
the
village
of
donton
lies
at
the
foot
of
one
of
these
great
chalk
ridges
which
are
called
the
south
downs
the
ridge
in
this
place
is
i
think
about
of
a
mile
high
by
the
high
road
which
is
obliged
to
go
twisting
about
in
order
to
get
to
the
top
of
it
the
hill
sweeps
round
from
about
west
north
west
to
east
south
east
and
of
course
it
keeps
off
all
the
heavy
winds
and
especially
the
south
west
winds
before
which
in
this
part
of
england
and
all
the
south
and
western
part
of
it
even
the
oak
trees
seem
as
if
they
would
gladly
flee
for
it
shaves
them
up
as
completely
as
you
see
a
quickset
hedge
shaved
by
hook
or
shears
talking
of
hedges
reminds
me
of
having
seen
a
just
as
i
came
out
of
petworth
more
than
twelve
feet
broad
and
about
fifteen
feet
high
i
dare
say
it
is
several
centuries
old
i
think
it
is
about
forty
yards
long
it
is
a
great
curiosity
the
apple
trees
at
donnington
show
their
gratitude
to
the
hill
for
its
shelter
for
i
have
seldom
seen
apple
trees
in
england
so
large
so
fine
and
in
general
so
flourishing
i
should
like
to
have
or
to
see
an
orchard
of
american
apples
under
this
hill
the
hill
you
will
observe
does
not
shade
the
ground
at
donnington
it
slopes
too
much
for
that
but
it
affords
complete
shelter
from
the
mischievous
winds
it
is
very
pretty
to
look
down
upon
this
little
village
as
you
come
winding
up
the
hill
from
this
hill
i
ought
to
have
had
a
most
extensive
view
i
ought
to
have
seen
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
sea
before
me
and
to
have
looked
back
to
chalk
hill
at
reigate
at
the
foot
of
which
i
had
left
some
bleaching
but
alas
had
begun
his
works
for
the
day
before
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
soon
after
the
two
had
assured
me
that
there
would
be
no
rain
i
saw
beginning
to
poke
up
over
the
south
downs
then
right
before
me
several
parcels
of
those
white
curled
clouds
that
we
call
and
they
are
just
like
judges
wigs
not
the
things
which
the
judges
wear
when
they
have
to
listen
to
the
dull
wrangling
and
duller
jests
of
the
lawyers
but
those
wigs
which
hang
down
about
their
shoulders
when
they
are
about
to
tell
you
a
little
of
and
when
their
very
looks
say
these
clouds
if
rising
from
the
south
west
hold
precisely
the
same
language
to
the
traveller
rain
is
to
follow
them
the
sun
was
shining
very
beautifully
when
i
first
saw
these
judges
wigs
rising
over
the
hills
at
the
sight
of
them
he
soon
began
to
hide
his
face
and
before
i
got
to
the
top
of
the
hill
of
donton
the
white
clouds
had
become
black
had
spread
themselves
all
around
and
a
pretty
decent
and
sturdy
rain
began
to
fall
i
had
resolved
to
come
to
this
place
singleton
to
breakfast
i
quitted
the
turnpike
road
from
petworth
to
chichester
at
a
village
called
upwaltham
about
a
mile
from
donnington
hill
and
came
down
a
lane
which
led
me
first
to
a
village
called
eastdean
then
to
another
called
westdean
i
suppose
and
then
to
this
village
of
singleton
and
here
i
am
on
the
turnpike
road
from
midhurst
to
chichester
the
lane
goes
along
through
some
of
the
finest
farms
in
the
world
it
is
impossible
for
corn
land
and
for
agriculture
to
be
finer
than
these
in
cases
like
mine
you
are
pestered
to
death
to
find
out
the
way
to
to
get
from
place
to
place
the
people
you
have
to
deal
with
are
innkeepers
ostlers
and
and
they
think
you
mad
if
you
express
your
wish
to
avoid
turnpike
roads
and
a
great
deal
more
than
half
mad
if
you
talk
of
going
even
from
necessity
by
any
other
road
they
think
you
a
strange
fellow
if
you
will
not
ride
six
miles
on
a
turnpike
road
rather
than
two
on
any
other
road
this
plague
i
experienced
on
this
occasion
i
wanted
to
go
from
petworth
to
havant
my
way
was
through
singleton
and
funtington
i
had
no
business
at
chichester
which
took
me
too
far
to
the
south
nor
at
midhurst
which
took
me
too
far
to
the
west
but
though
i
stayed
all
day
after
my
arrival
at
petworth
and
though
i
slept
there
i
could
get
no
directions
how
to
set
out
to
come
to
singleton
where
i
am
now
i
started
therefore
on
the
chichester
road
trusting
to
my
enquiries
of
the
country
people
as
i
came
on
by
these
means
i
got
hither
down
a
long
valley
on
the
south
downs
which
valley
winds
and
twists
about
amongst
hills
some
higher
and
some
lower
forming
cross
dells
inlets
and
ground
in
such
a
variety
of
shapes
that
it
is
impossible
to
describe
and
the
whole
of
the
ground
hill
as
well
as
dell
is
fine
most
beautiful
corn
land
or
is
covered
with
trees
or
underwood
as
to
swithin
i
set
him
at
defiance
the
road
was
flinty
and
very
flinty
i
rode
a
foot
pace
and
got
here
wet
to
the
skin
i
am
very
glad
i
came
this
road
the
corn
is
all
fine
all
good
fine
crops
and
no
appearance
of
blight
the
barley
extremely
fine
the
corn
not
forwarder
than
in
the
weald
no
beans
here
few
oats
comparatively
chiefly
wheat
and
barley
but
great
quantities
of
swedish
turnips
and
those
very
forward
more
swedish
turnips
here
upon
one
single
farm
than
upon
all
the
farms
that
i
saw
between
the
wen
and
petworth
these
turnips
are
in
some
places
a
foot
high
and
nearly
cover
the
ground
the
farmers
are
however
plagued
by
this
swithin
who
keeps
up
a
continual
drip
which
prevents
the
thriving
of
the
turnips
and
the
killing
of
the
weeds
the
are
good
here
in
general
fine
walnut
trees
and
an
abundant
crop
of
walnuts
this
is
a
series
of
villages
all
belonging
to
the
duke
of
richmond
the
outskirts
of
whose
park
and
woods
come
up
to
these
farming
lands
all
of
which
belong
to
him
and
i
suppose
that
every
inch
of
land
that
i
came
through
this
morning
belongs
either
to
the
duke
of
richmond
or
to
lord
egremont
no
in
that
mind
if
those
who
till
the
land
have
and
i
should
act
unjustly
towards
these
noblemen
if
i
insinuated
that
the
husbandmen
have
not
fair
play
as
far
as
the
landlords
are
concerned
for
everybody
speaks
well
of
them
there
is
besides
to
be
seen
here
i
have
seen
no
wretchedness
in
sussex
nothing
to
be
at
all
compared
to
that
which
i
have
seen
in
other
parts
and
as
to
these
villages
in
the
south
downs
they
are
beautiful
to
behold
hume
and
other
historians
rail
against
the
and
we
enlightened
and
free
creatures
as
we
are
look
back
with
scorn
or
at
least
with
surprise
and
pity
to
the
vassalage
of
our
forefathers
but
if
the
matter
were
well
enquired
into
not
slurred
over
but
well
and
truly
examined
we
should
find
that
the
people
of
these
villages
were
in
the
days
of
william
rufus
as
are
the
people
of
the
present
day
and
that
vassalage
only
under
other
names
exists
now
as
completely
as
it
existed
then
well
but
out
of
this
if
true
arises
another
question
namely
whether
the
millions
would
derive
any
benefit
from
being
transferred
from
these
great
lords
who
possess
them
by
hundreds
to
jews
and
jobbers
who
would
possess
them
by
or
by
couples
one
thing
we
may
say
with
a
certainty
of
being
right
and
that
is
that
the
transfer
would
be
bad
for
the
lords
themselves
there
is
an
appearance
of
comfort
about
the
dwellings
of
the
labourers
all
along
here
that
is
very
pleasant
to
behold
the
gardens
are
neat
and
full
of
vegetables
of
the
best
kinds
i
see
very
few
of
ireland
lazy
root
and
never
in
this
country
will
the
people
be
base
enough
to
lie
down
and
expire
from
starvation
under
the
operation
of
the
nothing
but
a
will
ever
do
that
as
i
came
along
between
upwaltham
and
eastdean
i
called
to
me
a
young
man
who
along
with
other
was
sitting
under
the
shelter
of
a
hedge
at
breakfast
he
came
running
to
me
with
his
victuals
in
his
hand
and
i
was
glad
to
see
that
his
food
consisted
of
a
good
lump
of
household
bread
and
not
a
very
small
piece
of
i
did
not
envy
him
his
appetite
for
i
had
at
that
moment
a
very
good
one
of
my
own
but
i
wanted
to
know
the
distance
i
had
to
go
before
i
should
get
to
a
good
in
parting
with
him
i
said
you
do
get
some
then
oh
yes
sir
said
he
and
with
an
emphasis
and
a
swag
of
the
head
which
seemed
to
say
we
and
have
i
saw
and
with
great
delight
a
pig
at
almost
every
labourer
house
the
houses
are
good
and
warm
and
the
gardens
some
of
the
very
best
that
i
have
seen
in
england
what
a
difference
good
god
what
a
difference
between
this
country
and
the
neighbourhood
of
those
corrupt
places
and
what
sort
of
would
this
man
have
had
in
a
mess
of
could
he
have
and
worked
in
the
wet
too
with
such
food
monstrous
no
society
ought
to
exist
where
the
labourers
live
in
a
sort
of
way
the
is
everlastingly
asserting
the
mischievous
consequences
of
the
want
of
these
people
th
a
and
telling
us
how
well
they
are
off
in
the
north
now
this
i
know
that
in
the
north
the
enlightened
people
eat
and
that
is
to
say
and
or
the
root
of
if
this
be
the
effect
of
their
give
me
the
o
th
a
sooth
this
is
according
to
what
i
have
heard
if
when
i
go
to
the
north
i
find
the
labourers
more
than
those
of
the
sooth
i
shall
then
say
that
enlightening
is
a
very
good
thing
but
give
me
none
of
that
light
or
of
that
grace
which
makes
a
man
content
with
oatmeal
and
water
or
that
makes
him
patiently
lie
down
and
die
of
starvation
amidst
abundance
of
food
the
hears
the
labourers
crying
out
in
sussex
they
are
right
to
cry
out
in
time
when
they
are
actually
brought
down
to
the
extreme
unction
it
is
useless
to
cry
out
and
next
to
the
extreme
unction
is
the
of
the
enlightened
slaves
who
toil
in
the
factories
for
the
lords
of
the
loom
talk
of
talk
of
talk
of
are
there
any
of
these
or
did
feudal
times
ever
see
any
of
them
so
debased
so
absolutely
slaves
as
the
poor
creatures
who
in
the
enlightened
north
are
compelled
to
work
fourteen
hours
in
a
day
in
a
heat
of
degrees
and
who
are
liable
to
punishment
for
looking
out
at
a
window
of
the
factory
this
is
really
a
soaking
day
thus
far
i
got
here
at
nine
i
stripped
off
my
coat
and
put
it
by
the
kitchen
fire
in
a
parlour
just
eight
feet
square
i
have
another
fire
and
have
dried
my
shirt
on
my
back
we
shall
see
what
this
does
for
a
the
clouds
fly
so
low
as
to
be
seen
passing
by
the
sides
of
even
little
hills
on
these
downs
the
devil
is
said
to
be
busy
in
a
wind
but
he
really
appears
to
be
busy
now
in
this
south
west
wind
the
quakers
will
next
market
day
at
mark
lane
be
as
busy
as
he
they
and
the
ministers
and
swithin
and
devil
all
seem
to
be
of
a
mind
i
must
not
forget
the
that
of
donnington
is
very
small
for
a
church
it
is
about
twenty
feet
wide
and
thirty
long
it
is
however
sufficient
for
the
population
the
amount
of
which
is
two
hundred
and
not
one
half
of
whom
are
of
course
ever
at
church
at
one
time
there
is
however
plenty
of
room
for
the
whole
the
tower
of
this
church
is
about
double
the
size
of
a
the
parson
whose
name
is
davidson
did
not
when
the
return
was
laid
before
parliament
in
reside
in
the
parish
though
the
living
is
a
large
living
the
parsonage
house
was
let
to
a
lady
and
her
three
daughters
what
impudence
a
man
must
have
to
put
this
into
a
return
the
church
at
upwaltham
is
about
such
another
and
the
tower
still
less
than
that
at
donnington
here
the
population
is
the
parish
is
a
rectory
and
in
the
return
before
mentioned
the
parson
whose
name
was
tripp
says
that
the
church
will
hold
the
population
but
that
the
parsonage
house
will
not
hold
him
and
why
because
it
is
a
miserable
cottage
i
looked
about
for
this
miserable
cottage
and
could
not
find
it
what
on
impudent
fellow
this
must
have
been
and
indeed
what
a
state
of
impudence
have
they
not
now
arrived
at
did
he
when
he
was
ordained
talk
anything
about
a
fine
house
to
live
in
did
jesus
christ
and
saint
paul
talk
about
fine
houses
did
not
this
priest
most
solemnly
vow
to
god
upon
the
altar
that
he
would
be
constant
in
season
and
out
of
season
in
watching
over
the
souls
of
his
flock
however
it
is
useless
to
remonstrate
with
this
set
of
men
nothing
will
have
any
effect
upon
them
they
will
keep
grasping
at
the
tithes
as
long
as
they
can
reach
them
miserable
cottage
what
impudence
what
tripp
is
it
a
fine
house
that
you
have
been
appointed
and
ordained
to
live
in
lord
egremont
is
the
patron
of
tripp
and
he
has
a
to
perform
too
for
the
living
is
he
is
in
this
case
only
an
hereditary
for
the
public
and
he
ought
to
see
that
this
parson
resides
in
the
parish
which
according
to
his
own
return
yields
him
eastdean
is
a
vicarage
with
a
population
of
a
church
which
the
parson
says
will
hold
and
which
i
say
will
hold
or
and
a
living
worth
in
the
gift
of
the
bishop
of
chichester
westdean
is
united
with
singleton
the
living
is
in
the
gift
of
the
church
at
chichester
and
the
duke
of
richmond
alternately
it
is
a
large
living
it
has
a
population
of
and
the
two
churches
says
the
parson
will
hold
people
what
careless
or
what
impudent
fellows
these
must
have
been
these
two
churches
will
hold
a
thousand
people
packed
much
less
close
than
they
are
in
meeting
houses
at
upwaltham
there
is
a
toll
gate
and
when
the
woman
opened
the
door
of
the
house
to
come
and
let
me
through
i
saw
some
lying
in
a
chair
she
showed
it
me
and
i
found
that
it
was
made
by
her
husband
in
the
evenings
after
he
came
home
from
work
in
order
to
make
him
a
hat
for
the
harvest
i
told
her
how
to
get
better
straw
for
the
purpose
and
when
i
told
her
that
she
must
cut
the
grass
or
the
grain
she
said
aye
i
dare
say
it
is
so
and
i
wonder
we
never
thought
of
that
before
for
we
sometimes
make
hats
out
of
rushes
cut
green
and
dried
and
the
hats
are
very
durable
this
woman
ought
to
have
my
she
keeps
the
at
upwaltham
which
is
called
waltham
and
which
is
on
the
turnpike
road
from
petworth
to
chichester
now
if
any
gentleman
who
lives
at
chichester
will
call
upon
my
son
at
the
office
of
the
register
in
fleet
street
and
ask
for
a
copy
of
to
be
given
to
this
woman
he
will
receive
the
copy
and
my
thanks
if
he
will
have
the
goodness
to
give
it
to
her
and
to
point
to
her
the
essay
on
straw
plat
hants
saturday
here
i
am
in
spite
of
st
swithin
the
truth
is
that
the
saint
is
like
most
other
oppressors
him
him
and
he
relaxes
after
drying
myself
and
sitting
the
better
part
of
four
hours
at
singleton
i
started
in
the
rain
boldly
setting
the
saint
at
defiance
and
expecting
to
have
not
one
dry
thread
by
the
time
i
got
to
havant
which
is
nine
miles
from
fareham
and
four
from
cosham
to
my
most
agreeable
surprise
the
rain
ceased
before
i
got
by
selsey
i
suppose
it
is
called
where
lord
selsey
house
and
beautiful
and
fine
estate
is
on
i
went
turning
off
to
the
right
to
go
to
funtington
and
westbourn
and
getting
to
havant
to
bait
my
horse
about
four
from
lavant
about
two
miles
back
from
funtington
the
ground
begins
to
be
a
sea
side
flat
the
soil
is
somewhat
varied
in
quality
and
kind
but
with
the
exception
of
an
enclosed
common
between
funtington
and
westbourn
it
is
all
good
soil
the
corn
of
all
kinds
good
and
earlier
than
further
back
they
have
begun
cutting
peas
here
and
near
lavant
i
saw
a
field
of
wheat
nearly
ripe
the
swedish
turnips
very
fine
and
still
earlier
than
on
the
south
downs
prodigious
crops
of
walnuts
but
the
apples
bad
along
here
the
south
west
winds
have
cut
them
off
and
indeed
how
should
it
be
otherwise
if
these
winds
happen
to
prevail
in
may
or
early
in
june
on
the
new
enclosure
near
funtington
the
wheat
and
oats
are
both
nearly
ripe
in
a
new
enclosure
near
westbourn
i
saw
the
only
really
blighted
wheat
that
i
have
yet
seen
this
year
oh
exclaimed
i
that
my
lord
liverpool
that
my
much
respected
could
but
see
that
wheat
which
god
and
the
seedsman
intended
to
be
but
which
the
devil
listening
to
the
prayers
of
the
quakers
has
made
oh
could
but
my
lord
see
it
lying
flat
upon
the
ground
with
the
and
the
pushing
up
through
it
and
with
a
whole
flock
of
rooks
pecking
away
at
its
ears
then
would
my
much
valued
lord
say
indeed
that
the
of
agriculture
are
about
to
receive
the
abatement
but
now
i
come
to
one
of
the
great
objects
of
my
journey
that
is
to
say
to
see
the
state
of
the
corn
along
at
the
south
foot
and
on
the
south
side
of
portsdown
hill
it
is
impossible
that
there
can
be
anywhere
a
better
corn
country
than
this
the
hill
is
eight
miles
long
and
about
of
a
mile
high
beginning
at
the
road
that
runs
along
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
on
the
the
corn
land
goes
rather
better
than
half
way
up
and
on
the
the
corn
land
is
about
the
third
it
may
be
half
a
mile
wide
portsdown
hill
is
very
much
in
the
shape
of
an
oblong
tin
cover
to
a
dish
from
bedhampton
which
lies
at
the
eastern
end
of
the
hill
to
fareham
which
is
at
the
western
end
of
it
you
have
brought
under
your
eye
not
less
than
eight
square
miles
of
corn
fields
with
scarcely
a
hedge
or
ditch
of
any
consequence
and
being
on
an
average
from
twenty
to
forty
acres
each
in
extent
the
land
is
excellent
the
situation
good
for
manure
the
spot
the
in
the
whole
here
if
the
corn
were
backward
then
the
harvest
must
be
backward
we
were
talking
at
reigate
of
the
prospect
of
a
backward
harvest
i
observed
that
it
was
a
rule
that
if
no
were
under
portsdown
hill
on
the
hill
july
the
harvest
must
be
generally
backward
when
i
made
this
observation
the
was
passed
but
i
determined
in
my
mind
to
come
and
see
how
the
matter
stood
when
therefore
i
got
to
the
village
of
bedhampton
i
began
to
look
out
pretty
sharply
i
came
on
to
wimmering
which
is
just
about
the
along
the
foot
of
the
hill
and
there
i
saw
at
a
good
distance
from
me
five
men
reaping
in
a
field
of
wheat
of
about
acres
i
found
upon
enquiry
that
they
began
this
morning
and
that
the
wheat
belongs
to
boniface
of
wimmering
here
the
first
sheaf
is
cut
that
is
cut
in
england
that
the
reader
may
depend
upon
it
was
never
known
that
the
average
even
of
hampshire
was
less
than
ten
days
behind
the
average
of
portsdown
hill
the
corn
under
the
hill
is
as
good
as
i
ever
saw
it
except
in
the
year
no
beans
here
no
peas
scarcely
any
oats
wheat
barley
and
turnips
the
swedish
turnips
not
so
good
as
on
the
south
downs
and
near
funtington
but
the
wheat
full
as
good
rather
better
and
the
barley
as
good
as
it
is
possible
to
be
in
looking
at
these
crops
one
wonders
whence
are
to
come
the
hands
to
clear
them
off
a
very
pleasant
ride
and
the
pleasanter
for
my
having
set
the
wet
saint
at
defiance
it
is
about
thirty
miles
from
petworth
to
fareham
and
i
got
in
in
very
good
time
i
have
now
come
if
i
include
my
for
the
purpose
of
looking
at
farms
and
woods
a
round
hundred
miles
from
the
wen
to
this
town
of
fareham
and
in
the
whole
of
the
hundred
miles
i
have
not
seen
one
single
though
i
have
come
through
as
fine
corn
countries
as
any
in
england
and
by
the
homesteads
of
the
richest
of
farmers
not
one
single
have
i
seen
and
not
one
rick
of
any
sort
of
corn
i
never
saw
nor
heard
of
the
like
of
this
before
and
if
i
had
not
witnessed
the
fact
with
my
own
eyes
i
could
not
have
believed
it
there
are
some
farmers
who
have
corn
in
their
barns
perhaps
but
when
there
is
no
left
there
is
very
little
corn
in
the
hands
of
farmers
yet
the
markets
swithin
notwithstanding
do
not
rise
this
harvest
must
be
three
weeks
later
than
usual
and
the
last
harvest
was
three
weeks
earlier
than
usual
the
last
crop
was
begun
upon
at
once
on
account
of
the
badness
of
the
wheat
of
the
year
before
so
that
the
last
crop
will
have
had
to
give
food
for
thirteen
months
and
a
half
and
yet
the
markets
do
not
rise
and
yet
there
are
men
farmers
mad
enough
to
think
that
they
have
got
past
the
bad
place
and
that
things
will
come
about
and
are
coming
about
and
lethbridge
of
the
collective
withdraws
his
motion
because
he
has
got
what
he
wanted
namely
a
return
of
good
and
prices
the
of
this
day
which
has
met
me
at
this
place
has
the
following
paragraph
the
weather
is
much
improved
though
it
does
not
yet
assume
the
character
of
being
fine
at
the
corn
exchange
since
monday
the
arrivals
consist
of
quarters
of
wheat
quarters
of
barley
quarters
of
oats
and
sacks
of
flour
the
demand
for
wheat
is
next
to
zero
and
for
oats
it
is
extremely
dull
to
effect
sales
prices
are
not
much
attended
to
for
the
demand
can
not
be
increased
at
the
present
currency
the
farmers
should
pay
attention
to
oats
for
the
foreign
new
under
the
king
lock
will
be
brought
into
consumption
unless
a
decline
takes
place
immediately
and
a
weight
will
thereby
be
thrown
over
the
markets
which
under
existing
circumstances
will
be
extremely
detrimental
to
the
agricultural
interests
its
distress
however
does
not
deserve
much
sympathy
for
as
soon
as
there
was
a
prospect
of
the
payment
of
rents
the
cause
of
the
people
was
abandoned
by
the
representatives
of
agriculture
in
the
collected
wisdom
and
brougham
most
excellent
measure
for
increasing
the
consumption
of
malt
was
neglected
where
there
is
no
sympathy
none
can
be
expected
and
the
land
proprietors
need
not
in
future
depend
on
the
assistance
of
the
mercantile
and
manufacturing
interests
should
their
own
distress
again
require
a
united
effort
to
remedy
the
general
grievances
as
to
the
mercantile
and
manufacturing
people
what
is
the
land
to
expect
from
them
but
i
agree
with
the
that
the
landlords
deserve
ruin
they
abandoned
the
public
cause
the
moment
they
thought
that
they
saw
a
prospect
of
getting
rents
that
prospect
will
soon
disappear
unless
they
pray
hard
to
swithin
to
insist
upon
forty
days
wet
his
i
do
not
see
what
the
farmers
can
do
about
the
price
of
oats
they
have
no
power
to
do
anything
unless
they
come
with
their
cavalry
horses
and
storm
the
king
lock
in
short
it
is
all
confusion
in
men
minds
as
well
as
in
their
pockets
there
must
be
something
completely
out
of
joint
when
the
government
are
afraid
of
the
effects
of
a
good
crop
i
intend
to
set
off
for
botley
and
go
thence
to
easton
and
then
to
alton
and
crondall
and
farnham
to
see
how
the
are
there
by
the
time
that
i
get
back
to
the
wen
i
shall
know
nearly
the
real
state
of
the
case
as
to
crops
and
that
at
this
time
is
a
great
matter
through
the
of
hampshire
back
through
the
of
surrey
along
the
weald
of
surrey
and
then
over
the
surrey
hills
down
to
the
wen
hampshire
august
i
got
to
fareham
on
saturday
night
after
having
got
a
soaking
on
the
south
downs
on
the
morning
of
that
day
on
the
sunday
morning
intending
to
go
and
spend
the
day
at
titchfield
about
three
miles
and
a
half
from
fareham
and
perceiving
upon
looking
out
of
the
window
about
in
the
morning
that
it
was
likely
to
rain
i
got
up
struck
a
bustle
got
up
the
ostler
set
off
and
got
to
my
destined
point
before
in
the
morning
and
here
i
experienced
the
benefits
of
early
rising
for
i
had
scarcely
got
well
and
safely
under
cover
when
swithin
began
to
pour
down
again
and
he
continued
to
pour
during
the
whole
of
the
day
from
fareham
to
titchfield
village
a
large
part
of
the
ground
is
a
common
enclosed
some
years
ago
it
is
therefore
amongst
the
worst
of
the
land
in
the
country
yet
i
did
not
see
a
bad
field
of
corn
along
here
and
the
swedish
turnips
were
i
think
full
as
fine
as
any
that
i
saw
upon
the
south
downs
but
it
is
to
be
observed
that
this
land
is
in
the
hands
of
people
and
is
conveniently
situated
for
the
receiving
of
manure
from
portsmouth
before
i
got
to
my
house
i
passed
by
a
farm
where
i
expected
to
find
a
standing
i
did
not
however
and
this
is
the
strongest
possible
proof
that
the
stock
of
corn
is
gone
out
of
the
hands
of
the
farmers
i
set
out
from
titchfield
at
in
the
evening
and
had
seven
miles
to
go
to
reach
botley
it
rained
but
i
got
myself
well
furnished
forth
as
a
defence
against
the
rain
i
had
not
gone
two
hundred
yards
before
the
rain
ceased
so
that
i
was
singularly
fortunate
as
to
rain
this
day
and
i
had
now
to
congratulate
myself
on
the
success
of
the
remedy
for
the
which
i
used
the
day
before
on
the
south
downs
for
really
though
i
had
a
spell
or
two
of
coughing
on
saturday
morning
when
i
set
out
from
petworth
i
have
not
had
up
to
this
hour
any
spell
at
all
since
i
got
wet
upon
the
south
downs
i
got
to
botley
about
nine
having
stopped
two
or
three
times
to
look
about
me
as
i
went
along
for
i
had
in
the
first
place
to
ride
for
about
three
miles
of
my
road
upon
a
turnpike
road
of
which
i
was
the
projector
and
indeed
the
maker
in
the
next
place
i
had
to
ride
for
something
better
than
half
a
mile
of
my
way
along
between
fields
and
coppices
that
were
mine
until
they
came
into
the
hands
of
the
mortgagee
and
by
the
side
of
cottages
of
my
own
building
the
only
matter
of
much
interest
with
me
was
the
state
of
the
inhabitants
of
those
cottages
i
stopped
at
two
or
three
places
and
made
some
little
enquiries
i
rode
up
to
two
or
three
houses
in
the
village
of
botley
which
i
had
to
pass
through
and
just
before
it
was
dark
i
got
to
a
farmhouse
close
by
the
church
and
what
was
more
not
a
great
many
yards
from
the
dwelling
of
that
delectable
creature
the
botley
parson
whom
however
i
have
not
seen
during
my
stay
at
this
place
botley
lies
in
a
valley
the
soil
of
which
is
a
deep
and
stiff
clay
oak
trees
grow
well
and
this
year
the
wheat
grows
well
as
it
does
upon
all
the
clays
that
i
have
seen
i
have
never
seen
the
wheat
better
in
general
in
this
part
of
the
country
than
it
is
now
i
have
i
think
seen
it
heavier
but
never
clearer
from
blight
it
is
backward
compared
to
the
wheat
in
many
other
parts
some
of
it
is
quite
green
but
none
of
it
has
any
appearance
of
blight
this
is
not
much
of
a
barley
country
the
oats
are
good
the
beans
that
i
have
seen
very
indifferent
the
best
news
that
i
have
learnt
here
is
that
the
botley
parson
is
become
quite
a
gentle
creature
compared
to
what
he
used
to
be
the
people
in
the
village
have
told
me
some
most
ridiculous
stories
about
his
having
been
hoaxed
in
london
it
seems
that
somebody
danced
him
up
from
botley
to
london
by
telling
him
that
a
legacy
had
been
left
him
or
some
such
story
up
went
the
parson
on
horseback
being
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
run
the
risk
of
coach
the
hoaxers
it
appears
got
him
to
some
hotel
and
there
set
upon
him
a
whole
tribe
of
applicants
lawyers
with
deeds
of
conveyance
for
borrowed
money
curates
in
want
of
churches
travelling
companions
ladies
maids
dealers
in
yorkshire
hams
newcastle
coals
and
dealers
in
dried
at
islington
in
short
if
i
am
rightly
informed
they
kept
the
parson
in
town
for
several
days
bothered
him
three
parts
out
of
his
senses
compelled
him
to
escape
as
it
were
from
a
fire
and
then
when
he
got
home
he
found
the
village
posted
all
over
with
handbills
giving
an
account
of
his
adventure
under
the
pretence
of
offering
reward
for
a
discovery
of
the
hoaxers
the
good
of
it
was
the
parson
ascribed
his
disgrace
and
they
say
that
he
perseveres
to
this
hour
in
accusing
me
of
it
upon
my
word
i
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
matter
and
this
affair
only
shows
that
i
am
not
the
only
friend
that
the
parson
has
in
the
world
though
this
may
have
had
a
tendency
to
produce
in
the
parson
that
amelioration
of
deportment
which
is
said
to
become
him
so
well
there
is
something
else
that
has
taken
place
which
has
in
all
probability
had
a
more
powerful
influence
in
this
way
namely
a
great
reduction
in
the
value
of
the
parson
living
which
was
at
one
time
little
short
of
five
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
which
i
believe
is
now
not
the
half
of
that
sum
this
to
be
sure
is
not
only
a
natural
but
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
change
in
the
value
of
money
the
parsons
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
another
sort
of
landlords
they
must
fall
of
course
in
their
demands
or
their
demands
will
not
be
paid
they
may
take
in
kind
but
that
will
answer
them
no
purpose
at
all
they
will
be
less
people
than
they
have
been
and
will
continue
to
grow
less
and
less
until
the
day
when
the
whole
of
the
tithes
and
other
church
property
as
it
is
called
shall
be
applied
to
public
purposes
hampshire
wednesday
evening
this
village
of
easton
lies
at
a
few
miles
towards
the
from
winchester
it
is
distant
from
botley
by
the
way
which
i
came
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
miles
i
came
through
durley
where
i
went
to
the
house
of
farmer
mears
i
was
very
much
pleased
with
what
i
saw
at
durley
which
is
about
two
miles
from
botley
and
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
obscure
villages
in
this
whole
kingdom
mears
the
farmer
wife
had
made
of
the
crested
dog
tail
grass
a
bonnet
which
she
wears
herself
i
there
saw
girls
platting
the
straw
they
had
made
plat
of
several
degrees
of
fineness
and
they
sell
it
to
some
person
or
persons
at
fareham
who
i
suppose
makes
it
into
bonnets
mears
who
is
a
very
intelligent
and
clever
woman
has
two
girls
at
work
each
of
whom
earns
per
week
as
much
within
a
shilling
as
her
father
who
is
a
labouring
man
earns
per
week
the
father
has
at
this
time
only
per
week
these
two
girls
and
not
very
stout
girls
earn
six
shillings
a
week
each
thus
the
income
of
this
family
is
from
seven
shillings
a
week
raised
to
nineteen
shillings
a
week
i
shall
suppose
that
this
may
in
some
measure
be
owing
to
the
generosity
of
ladies
in
the
neighbourhood
and
to
their
desire
to
promote
this
domestic
manufacture
but
if
i
suppose
that
these
girls
receive
double
compared
to
what
they
will
receive
for
the
same
quantity
of
labour
when
the
manufacture
becomes
more
general
is
it
not
a
great
thing
to
make
the
income
of
the
family
nineteen
shillings
a
week
instead
of
seven
very
little
indeed
could
these
poor
things
have
done
in
the
field
during
the
last
forty
days
and
besides
how
clean
how
healthful
how
everything
that
one
could
wish
is
this
sort
of
employment
the
farmer
who
is
also
a
very
intelligent
person
told
me
that
he
should
endeavour
to
introduce
the
manufacture
as
a
thing
to
assist
the
obtaining
of
employment
in
order
to
lessen
the
amount
of
the
i
think
it
very
likely
that
this
will
be
done
in
the
parish
of
durley
a
most
important
matter
it
is
put
paupers
in
the
way
of
ceasing
to
be
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
zeal
as
well
as
the
intelligence
of
the
farmer
wife
who
expressed
her
readiness
to
teach
the
girls
and
women
of
the
parish
in
order
to
enable
them
to
assist
themselves
i
shall
hear
in
all
probability
of
their
proceedings
at
durley
and
if
i
do
i
shall
make
a
point
of
communicating
to
the
public
an
account
of
those
interesting
proceedings
from
the
very
first
from
the
first
moment
of
my
thinking
about
this
straw
affair
i
regarded
it
as
likely
to
assist
in
bettering
the
lot
of
the
labouring
people
if
it
has
not
this
effect
i
value
it
not
it
is
not
worth
the
attention
of
any
of
us
but
i
am
satisfied
that
this
is
the
way
in
which
it
will
work
i
have
the
pleasure
to
know
that
there
is
one
labouring
family
at
any
rate
who
are
living
well
through
my
means
it
is
i
who
without
knowing
them
without
ever
having
seen
them
without
even
now
knowing
their
names
have
given
the
means
of
good
living
to
a
family
who
were
before
this
is
indisputably
my
work
and
when
i
reflect
that
there
must
necessarily
be
now
some
hundreds
of
families
and
shortly
many
thousands
of
families
in
england
who
are
and
will
be
through
my
means
living
well
instead
of
being
i
can
not
but
feel
myself
consoled
i
can
not
but
feel
that
i
have
some
compensation
for
the
sentence
passed
upon
me
by
ellenborough
grose
le
blanc
and
bailey
and
i
verily
believe
that
in
the
case
of
this
one
single
family
in
the
parish
of
durley
i
have
done
more
good
than
bailey
ever
did
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
notwithstanding
his
pious
commentary
on
the
book
of
common
prayer
i
will
allow
nothing
to
be
good
with
regard
to
the
labouring
classes
unless
it
make
an
addition
to
their
victuals
drink
or
clothing
as
to
their
that
is
much
too
sublime
matter
for
me
to
think
about
i
know
that
they
are
in
rags
and
that
they
have
not
a
and
i
know
that
the
way
to
make
them
good
to
make
them
honest
to
make
them
dutiful
to
make
them
kind
to
one
another
is
to
enable
them
to
live
well
and
i
also
know
that
none
of
these
things
will
ever
be
accomplished
by
methodist
sermons
and
by
those
stupid
at
once
stupid
and
malignant
things
and
roguish
things
called
religious
tracts
it
seems
that
this
farmer
at
durley
has
always
read
the
register
since
the
first
appearance
of
little
had
it
not
been
for
this
reading
mears
would
not
have
thought
about
the
grass
and
had
she
not
thought
about
the
grass
none
of
the
benefits
above
mentioned
would
have
arisen
to
her
neighbours
the
difference
between
this
affair
and
the
affairs
is
this
that
the
affairs
fill
the
pockets
of
rich
ruffians
such
as
those
who
would
have
murdered
me
at
coventry
and
that
this
straw
affair
makes
an
addition
to
the
food
and
raiment
of
the
labouring
classes
and
gives
not
a
penny
to
be
pocketed
by
the
rich
ruffians
from
durley
i
came
on
in
company
with
farmer
mears
through
upham
this
upham
is
the
place
where
young
who
wrote
that
bombastical
stuff
called
night
thoughts
was
once
the
parson
and
where
i
believe
he
was
born
away
to
the
right
of
upham
lies
the
little
town
of
waltham
whither
i
wished
to
go
very
much
but
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
from
upham
we
came
on
upon
the
high
land
called
black
down
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
that
hill
spoken
of
in
my
last
ride
we
are
here
getting
up
upon
the
chalk
hills
which
stretch
away
towards
winchester
the
soil
here
is
a
poor
blackish
stuff
with
little
white
stones
in
it
upon
a
bed
of
chalk
it
was
a
down
not
many
years
ago
the
madness
and
greediness
of
the
days
of
led
to
the
breaking
of
it
up
the
corn
upon
it
is
miserable
but
as
good
as
can
be
expected
upon
such
land
at
the
end
of
this
tract
we
come
to
a
spot
called
whiteflood
and
here
we
cross
the
old
turnpike
road
which
leads
from
winchester
to
gosport
through
bishop
waltham
whiteflood
is
at
the
foot
of
the
first
of
a
series
of
hills
over
which
you
come
to
get
to
the
top
of
that
lofty
ridge
called
morning
hill
the
farmer
came
to
the
top
of
the
first
hill
along
with
me
and
he
was
just
about
to
turn
back
when
i
looking
away
to
the
left
down
a
valley
which
stretched
across
the
other
side
of
the
down
observed
a
rather
singular
appearance
and
said
to
the
farmer
what
is
that
coming
up
that
valley
is
it
smoke
or
is
it
a
cloud
the
day
had
been
very
fine
hitherto
the
sun
was
shining
very
bright
where
we
were
the
farmer
answered
oh
it
smoke
it
comes
from
ouselberry
which
is
down
in
that
bottom
behind
those
trees
so
saying
we
bid
each
other
good
day
he
went
back
and
i
went
on
before
i
had
got
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
from
him
the
cloud
which
he
had
taken
for
the
ouselberry
smoke
came
upon
the
hill
and
wet
me
to
the
skin
he
was
not
far
from
the
house
at
whiteflood
but
i
am
sure
that
he
could
not
entirely
escape
it
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
the
clouds
sail
about
in
the
hilly
countries
and
particularly
i
think
amongst
the
i
have
never
observed
the
like
amongst
the
or
amongst
rocks
from
whiteflood
you
come
over
a
series
of
hills
part
of
which
form
a
called
longwood
warren
on
the
borders
of
which
is
the
house
and
estate
of
lord
northesk
these
hills
are
amongst
the
most
barren
of
the
downs
of
england
yet
a
part
of
them
was
broken
up
during
the
rage
for
improvements
during
the
rage
for
what
empty
men
think
was
an
augmenting
of
the
of
the
country
on
about
twenty
acres
of
this
land
sown
with
wheat
i
should
not
suppose
that
there
would
be
twice
twenty
bushels
of
grain
a
man
must
be
mad
or
nearly
mad
to
sow
wheat
upon
such
a
spot
however
a
large
part
of
what
was
enclosed
has
been
thrown
out
again
already
and
the
rest
will
be
thrown
out
in
a
very
few
years
the
down
itself
was
poor
what
then
must
it
be
as
think
of
the
destruction
which
has
here
taken
place
the
herbage
was
not
good
but
it
was
something
it
was
something
for
every
year
and
without
trouble
instead
of
grass
it
will
now
for
twenty
years
to
come
bear
nothing
but
that
species
of
weeds
which
is
hardy
enough
to
grow
where
the
grass
will
not
grow
and
this
was
augmenting
the
capital
of
the
nation
these
new
were
boasted
of
by
george
rose
and
by
pitt
as
proofs
of
national
prosperity
when
men
in
power
are
ignorant
to
this
extent
who
is
to
expect
anything
but
consequences
such
as
we
now
behold
from
the
top
of
this
high
land
called
and
the
real
name
of
which
is
from
a
chapel
which
once
stood
there
dedicated
to
mary
magdalen
from
the
top
of
this
land
you
have
a
view
of
a
circle
which
is
upon
an
average
about
seventy
miles
in
diameter
and
i
believe
in
no
one
place
so
little
as
fifty
miles
in
diameter
you
see
the
isle
of
wight
in
one
direction
and
in
the
opposite
direction
you
see
the
high
lands
in
berkshire
it
is
not
a
pleasant
view
however
the
fertile
spots
are
all
too
far
from
you
descending
from
this
hill
you
cross
the
about
two
miles
from
winchester
leading
from
winchester
to
london
through
alresford
and
farnham
as
soon
as
you
cross
the
road
you
enter
the
estate
of
the
descendant
of
rollo
duke
of
buckingham
which
estate
is
in
the
parish
of
avington
in
this
place
the
duke
has
a
farm
not
very
good
land
it
is
in
his
own
hands
the
corn
is
indifferent
except
the
barley
which
is
everywhere
good
you
come
a
full
mile
from
the
roadside
down
through
this
farm
to
the
at
avington
and
to
the
little
village
of
that
name
both
of
them
beautifully
situated
amidst
fine
and
lofty
trees
fine
meadows
and
streams
of
clear
water
on
this
farm
of
the
duke
i
saw
in
a
little
close
by
the
farmhouse
several
hens
in
coops
with
broods
of
pheasants
instead
of
chickens
it
seems
that
a
gamekeeper
lives
in
the
farmhouse
and
i
dare
say
the
duke
thinks
much
more
of
the
pheasants
than
of
the
corn
to
be
very
solicitous
to
preserve
what
has
been
raised
with
so
much
care
and
at
so
much
expense
is
by
no
means
unnatural
but
then
there
is
a
measure
to
be
observed
here
and
that
measure
was
certainly
outstretched
in
the
case
of
deller
i
here
saw
at
this
gamekeeping
farmhouse
what
i
had
not
seen
since
my
departure
from
the
wen
namely
a
hard
indeed
would
it
have
been
if
a
plantagenet
turned
farmer
had
not
a
in
his
hands
this
rick
contains
i
should
think
what
they
call
in
hampshire
ten
loads
of
wheat
that
is
to
say
fifty
quarters
or
four
hundred
bushels
and
this
is
the
only
rick
not
only
of
wheat
but
of
any
corn
whatever
that
i
have
seen
since
i
left
london
the
turnips
upon
this
farm
are
by
no
means
good
but
i
was
in
some
measure
compensated
for
the
bad
turnips
by
the
sight
of
the
about
a
dozen
females
amongst
whom
there
were
several
very
pretty
girls
and
they
were
as
merry
as
larks
there
had
been
a
shower
that
had
brought
them
into
a
sort
of
huddle
on
the
road
side
when
i
came
up
to
them
they
all
fixed
their
eyes
upon
me
and
upon
my
smiling
they
bursted
out
into
laughter
i
observed
to
them
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
was
a
very
happy
man
to
have
such
and
really
they
seemed
happier
and
better
off
than
any
that
i
saw
in
the
fields
all
the
way
from
london
to
this
spot
it
is
curious
enough
but
i
have
always
observed
that
the
women
along
this
part
of
the
country
are
usually
tall
these
girls
were
all
tall
straight
fair
excellent
complexion
and
uncommonly
gay
they
were
well
dressed
too
and
i
observed
the
same
of
all
the
men
that
i
saw
down
at
avington
this
could
not
be
the
case
if
the
duke
were
a
cruel
or
hard
master
and
this
is
an
act
of
justice
due
from
me
to
the
descendant
of
rollo
it
is
in
the
house
of
deller
that
i
make
these
notes
but
as
it
is
that
we
dislike
i
must
do
rollo
justice
and
i
must
again
say
that
the
good
looks
and
happy
faces
of
his
spoke
much
more
in
his
praise
than
could
have
been
spoken
by
fifty
lawyers
like
that
storks
who
was
employed
the
other
day
to
plead
against
the
editor
of
the
for
publishing
an
account
of
the
of
farmer
smith
of
ashendon
in
that
county
i
came
through
the
duke
park
to
come
to
easton
which
is
the
next
village
below
avington
a
very
pretty
park
the
house
is
quite
in
the
bottom
it
can
be
seen
in
no
direction
from
a
distance
greater
than
that
of
four
or
five
hundred
yards
the
river
itchen
which
rises
near
alresford
which
runs
down
through
winchester
to
southampton
goes
down
the
middle
of
this
valley
and
waters
all
its
immense
quantity
of
meadows
the
house
stands
not
far
from
the
river
itself
a
stream
of
water
is
brought
from
the
river
to
feed
a
pond
before
the
house
there
are
several
avenues
of
trees
which
are
very
beautiful
and
some
of
which
give
complete
shelter
to
the
kitchen
garden
which
has
besides
extraordinarily
high
walls
never
was
a
greater
contrast
than
that
presented
by
this
place
and
the
place
of
lord
egremont
the
latter
is
all
loftiness
everything
is
high
about
it
it
has
extensive
views
in
all
directions
it
sees
and
can
be
seen
by
all
the
country
around
if
i
had
the
ousting
of
one
of
these
noblemen
i
certainly
however
would
oust
the
duke
who
i
dare
say
will
by
no
means
be
desirous
of
seeing
arise
the
occasion
of
putting
the
sincerity
of
the
compliment
to
the
test
the
village
of
easton
is
like
that
of
avington
close
by
the
waterside
the
meadows
are
the
attraction
and
indeed
it
is
the
meadows
that
have
caused
the
villages
to
exist
hants
thursday
august
i
took
leave
of
deller
this
morning
about
came
back
through
avington
park
through
the
village
of
avington
and
crossing
the
itchen
river
came
over
to
the
village
of
itchen
abas
means
it
is
a
french
word
that
came
over
with
duke
progenitors
there
needs
no
better
proof
of
the
high
descent
of
the
duke
and
of
the
antiquity
of
his
family
this
is
that
itchen
abas
where
that
famous
the
reverend
robert
wright
lives
who
refused
to
hear
deller
complaint
against
the
duke
servant
at
his
own
house
and
who
afterwards
along
with
poulter
bound
deller
over
to
the
quarter
sessions
for
the
alleged
assault
i
have
great
pleasure
in
informing
the
public
that
deller
has
not
had
to
bear
the
expenses
in
this
case
himself
but
that
they
have
been
borne
by
his
neighbours
very
much
to
the
credit
of
those
neighbours
i
hear
of
an
affair
between
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
a
bird
who
resides
in
this
neighbourhood
if
i
had
had
time
i
should
have
gone
to
see
bird
of
whose
treatment
i
have
heard
a
great
deal
and
an
account
of
which
treatment
ought
to
be
brought
before
the
public
it
is
very
natural
for
the
duke
of
buckingham
to
wish
to
preserve
that
game
which
he
calls
his
it
is
very
natural
for
him
to
delight
in
his
hobby
but
my
lord
duke
ought
to
be
gentle
inoffensive
perfectly
harmless
little
creatures
they
ought
not
to
be
suffered
to
kick
and
fling
about
them
they
ought
not
to
be
and
above
all
things
they
ought
not
to
be
great
things
like
those
which
are
ridden
by
the
and
like
them
be
suffered
to
dance
and
caper
and
trample
poor
devils
of
farmers
under
foot
have
your
hobbies
my
lords
of
the
soil
but
let
them
be
gentle
in
short
let
them
be
hobbies
in
character
with
the
commons
and
forests
and
not
the
hobbies
from
the
barracks
at
knightsbridge
such
as
put
poor
sheriff
waithman
life
in
jeopardy
that
the
game
should
be
preserved
every
one
that
knows
anything
of
the
country
will
allow
but
every
man
of
any
sense
must
see
that
it
can
not
be
preserved
by
sheer
force
it
must
be
rather
through
love
than
through
fear
rather
through
than
through
if
the
thing
be
properly
managed
there
will
be
plenty
of
game
without
any
severity
towards
any
good
man
deller
case
was
so
plain
it
was
so
monstrous
to
think
that
a
man
was
to
be
punished
for
being
on
his
own
ground
in
pursuit
of
wild
animals
that
he
himself
had
raised
this
was
so
monstrous
that
it
was
only
necessary
to
name
it
to
excite
the
indignation
of
the
country
and
deller
has
by
his
spirit
and
perseverance
by
the
coolness
and
the
good
sense
which
he
has
shown
throughout
the
whole
of
this
proceeding
merited
the
commendation
of
every
man
who
is
not
in
his
heart
an
oppressor
it
occurs
to
me
to
ask
here
who
it
is
that
finally
for
those
counsels
opinions
which
poulter
and
wright
said
they
took
in
the
case
of
deller
because
if
these
counsels
opinions
are
paid
for
by
the
county
and
if
a
justice
of
the
peace
can
take
as
many
counsels
opinions
as
he
chooses
i
should
like
to
know
what
fellow
who
chooses
to
put
on
a
bobtail
wig
and
call
himself
a
lawyer
may
not
have
a
good
living
given
to
him
by
any
crony
justice
at
the
expense
of
the
county
this
never
can
be
legal
it
never
can
be
binding
on
the
county
to
pay
for
these
counsels
opinions
however
leaving
this
to
be
enquired
into
another
time
we
have
here
in
deller
case
an
instance
of
the
worth
of
counsels
opinions
deller
went
to
the
two
justices
showed
them
the
register
with
the
act
of
parliament
in
it
called
upon
them
to
act
agreeably
to
that
act
of
parliament
but
they
chose
to
take
counsels
opinion
first
the
two
counsel
the
two
lawyers
the
two
learned
friends
told
them
that
they
were
right
in
rejecting
the
application
of
deller
and
in
binding
him
over
for
the
assault
and
after
all
this
grand
jury
threw
out
the
bill
and
in
that
throwing
out
showed
that
they
thought
the
counsels
opinions
not
worth
a
straw
being
upon
the
subject
of
matter
connected
with
the
conduct
of
these
i
will
here
mention
what
is
now
going
on
in
hampshire
respecting
the
accounts
of
the
of
the
at
the
last
quarter
sessions
or
at
a
meeting
of
the
magistrates
previous
to
the
opening
of
the
sessions
there
was
a
discussion
relative
to
this
matter
the
substance
of
which
appears
to
have
been
this
that
the
treasurer
george
hollis
whose
accounts
had
been
audited
approved
of
and
passed
every
year
by
the
magistrates
is
in
arrear
to
the
county
to
the
amount
of
about
four
thousand
pounds
sir
thomas
baring
appears
to
have
been
the
great
stickler
against
hollis
who
was
but
feebly
defended
by
his
friends
the
treasurer
of
a
county
is
compelled
to
find
securities
these
securities
have
become
in
consequence
of
the
annual
passing
of
the
accounts
by
the
magistrates
nothing
can
be
more
just
than
this
exemption
i
am
security
suppose
for
a
treasurer
the
magistrates
do
not
pass
his
accounts
on
account
of
a
deficiency
i
make
good
the
deficiency
but
the
magistrates
are
not
to
go
on
year
after
year
passing
his
accounts
and
then
at
the
end
of
several
years
come
and
call
upon
me
to
make
good
the
deficiencies
thus
say
the
securities
of
hollis
the
magistrates
in
fact
are
to
blame
one
of
the
magistrates
a
reverend
orde
said
that
the
magistrates
were
more
to
blame
than
the
treasurer
and
really
i
think
so
too
for
though
hollis
has
been
a
tool
for
many
many
years
of
old
george
rose
and
the
rest
of
that
crew
it
seems
impossible
to
believe
that
he
could
have
intended
anything
dishonest
seeing
that
the
detection
arose
out
of
an
account
published
by
himself
in
the
newspaper
which
account
he
need
not
have
published
until
three
months
later
than
the
time
when
he
did
publish
it
this
is
as
he
himself
states
the
best
possible
proof
that
he
was
unconscious
of
any
error
or
any
deficiency
the
fact
appears
to
be
this
that
hollis
who
has
for
many
years
been
under
sheriff
as
well
as
treasurer
of
the
county
who
holds
several
other
offices
and
who
has
besides
had
large
pecuniary
transactions
with
his
bankers
has
for
years
had
his
accounts
so
blended
that
he
has
not
known
how
this
money
belonging
to
the
county
stood
his
own
statement
shows
that
it
was
all
a
mass
of
confusion
the
errors
he
says
have
arisen
entirely
from
the
negligence
of
his
clerks
and
from
causes
which
produced
a
confusion
in
his
accounts
this
is
the
fact
but
he
has
been
in
good
fat
offices
too
long
not
to
have
made
a
great
many
persons
think
that
his
offices
would
be
better
in
hands
and
they
appear
resolved
to
oust
him
i
for
my
part
am
glad
of
it
for
i
remember
his
coming
up
to
me
in
the
grand
jury
chamber
just
after
the
people
at
stephen
had
passed
bill
in
i
remember
his
coming
up
to
me
as
the
under
sheriff
of
willis
the
man
that
we
now
call
flemming
who
has
to
build
a
house
at
north
stoneham
i
remember
his
coming
up
to
me
and
with
all
the
base
sauciness
of
a
pittite
me
to
disperse
or
he
would
take
me
into
i
remember
this
of
hollis
and
i
am
therefore
glad
that
calamity
has
befallen
him
but
i
must
say
that
after
reading
his
own
account
of
the
matter
after
reading
the
debate
of
the
magistrates
and
after
hearing
the
observations
and
opinions
of
and
impartial
persons
in
hampshire
who
dislike
hollis
as
much
as
i
do
i
must
say
that
i
think
him
perfectly
clear
of
all
intention
to
commit
anything
like
fraud
or
to
make
anything
worthy
of
the
name
of
false
account
and
i
am
convinced
that
this
affair
which
will
now
prove
extremely
calamitous
to
him
might
have
been
laughed
at
by
him
at
the
time
when
wheat
was
fifteen
shillings
a
bushel
this
change
in
the
affairs
of
the
government
this
penury
now
experienced
by
the
pittites
at
whitehall
reaches
in
its
influence
to
every
part
of
the
country
the
barings
are
now
the
great
men
in
hampshire
they
were
not
such
in
the
days
of
george
rose
while
george
was
able
to
make
the
people
believe
that
it
was
necessary
to
give
their
money
freely
to
preserve
the
blessed
comforts
of
religion
george
rose
would
have
thrown
his
shield
over
hollis
his
broad
and
brazen
shield
in
hampshire
the
too
is
changed
the
present
is
doubtless
as
pious
as
the
last
every
bit
and
has
the
same
views
but
it
is
not
the
same
family
it
is
not
the
garniers
and
poulters
and
norths
and
de
grays
and
haygarths
it
is
not
precisely
the
same
set
who
have
the
power
in
their
hands
things
therefore
take
another
turn
the
pittite
are
all
and
the
barings
come
forward
with
their
weight
of
metal
it
was
exceedingly
unfortunate
for
hollis
that
sir
thomas
baring
happened
to
be
against
him
however
the
thing
will
do
good
altogether
the
county
is
placed
in
a
pretty
situation
its
treasurer
has
had
his
accounts
regularly
passed
by
the
magistrates
and
these
magistrates
come
at
last
and
discover
that
they
have
for
a
long
time
been
passing
accounts
that
they
ought
not
to
pass
these
magistrates
have
exempted
the
securities
of
hollis
but
not
a
word
do
they
say
about
making
good
the
deficiencies
what
redress
then
have
the
people
of
the
county
they
have
no
redress
unless
they
can
obtain
it
by
petitioning
the
parliament
and
if
they
do
not
petition
if
they
do
not
state
their
case
and
that
boldly
too
they
deserve
everything
that
can
befall
them
from
similar
causes
i
am
astonished
at
the
boldness
of
the
magistrates
i
am
astonished
that
they
should
think
of
calling
hollis
to
account
without
being
prepared
for
rendering
an
account
of
their
own
conduct
however
we
shall
see
what
they
will
do
in
the
end
and
when
we
have
seen
that
we
shall
see
whether
the
county
will
rest
quietly
under
the
loss
which
it
is
likely
to
sustain
i
must
now
go
back
to
itchen
abas
where
in
the
of
a
farmer
courtenay
i
saw
another
from
itchen
abas
i
came
up
the
valley
to
itchen
stoke
soon
after
that
i
crossed
the
itchen
river
came
out
into
the
alresford
turnpike
road
and
came
on
towards
alresford
having
the
valley
now
upon
my
left
if
the
hay
be
down
all
the
way
to
southampton
in
the
same
manner
that
it
is
along
here
there
are
thousands
of
acres
of
hay
rotting
on
the
sides
of
this
itchen
river
most
of
the
meadows
are
watered
artificially
the
crops
of
grass
are
heavy
and
they
appear
to
have
been
cut
precisely
in
the
right
time
to
be
spoiled
coming
on
towards
alresford
i
saw
a
gentleman
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
beyond
alresford
coming
out
of
his
gate
with
his
hat
off
looking
towards
the
as
if
to
see
what
sort
of
weather
it
was
likely
to
be
this
was
no
other
than
rolleston
or
rawlinson
who
it
appears
has
a
box
and
some
land
here
this
gentleman
was
when
i
lived
in
hampshire
one
of
those
worthy
men
who
in
the
several
counties
of
england
executed
without
any
sort
of
remuneration
such
a
large
portion
of
that
justice
which
is
the
envy
of
surrounding
nations
and
admiration
of
the
world
we
are
often
told
especially
in
parliament
of
the
of
these
persons
of
their
worthiness
their
piety
their
loyalty
their
excellent
qualities
of
all
sorts
but
particularly
of
their
in
taking
upon
them
the
office
of
justice
of
the
peace
spending
so
much
time
taking
so
much
trouble
and
all
for
nothing
at
all
but
for
the
pure
love
of
their
king
and
country
and
the
worst
of
it
is
that
our
ministers
upon
this
disinterestedness
and
generosity
and
as
in
the
case
of
rawlinson
at
the
end
of
perhaps
a
dozen
years
of
voluntarily
rendered
to
king
and
country
they
force
him
sorely
against
his
will
no
doubt
to
become
a
police
magistrate
in
london
to
be
sure
there
are
five
or
six
hundred
pounds
of
public
money
attached
to
this
but
what
are
these
paltry
pounds
to
a
country
gentleman
who
so
disinterestedly
rendered
us
services
for
so
many
years
hampshire
is
fertile
in
persons
of
this
disinterested
stamp
there
is
a
greme
who
lives
across
the
country
not
many
miles
from
the
spot
where
i
saw
justice
rawlinson
this
also
has
served
the
country
for
nothing
during
a
great
many
years
and
of
late
years
the
junior
eager
apparently
to
emulate
his
sire
has
become
a
distributor
of
stamps
for
this
famous
county
of
hants
what
rawlinson
may
have
is
more
than
i
know
at
present
though
i
will
endeavour
to
know
it
and
to
find
out
whether
they
also
be
us
a
great
deal
has
been
said
about
the
debt
of
gratitude
due
from
the
people
to
the
justices
of
the
peace
an
account
containing
the
names
and
places
of
abode
of
the
justices
and
of
the
public
money
or
titles
received
by
them
and
by
their
relations
such
an
account
would
be
a
very
useful
thing
we
should
then
know
the
real
amount
of
this
debt
of
gratitude
we
shall
see
such
an
account
and
we
should
have
seen
it
long
ago
if
there
had
been
in
a
certain
place
only
one
single
man
disposed
to
do
his
duty
i
came
through
alresford
about
eight
having
loitered
a
good
deal
in
coming
up
the
valley
after
quitting
alresford
you
come
on
the
road
towards
alton
to
the
village
of
bishop
sutton
and
then
to
a
place
called
ropley
dean
where
there
is
a
house
or
two
just
before
you
come
to
ropley
dean
you
see
the
beginning
of
the
valley
of
itchen
the
river
falls
into
the
salt
water
at
southampton
it
rises
or
rather
has
its
first
rise
just
by
the
road
side
at
ropley
dean
which
is
at
the
foot
of
that
very
high
land
which
lies
between
alresford
and
alton
all
along
by
the
itchen
river
up
to
its
very
source
there
are
meadows
and
this
vale
of
meadows
which
is
about
miles
in
length
and
is
in
some
places
a
mile
wide
is
at
the
point
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
only
about
twice
as
wide
as
my
horse
is
long
this
vale
of
itchen
is
worthy
of
particular
attention
there
are
few
spots
in
england
more
fertile
or
more
pleasant
and
none
i
believe
more
healthy
following
the
bed
of
the
river
or
rather
the
middle
of
the
vale
it
is
about
miles
in
length
from
ropley
dean
to
the
village
of
south
stoneham
which
is
just
above
southampton
the
average
width
of
the
meadows
is
i
should
think
a
hundred
rods
at
the
least
and
if
i
am
right
in
this
conjecture
the
vale
contains
about
five
thousand
acres
of
meadows
large
part
of
which
is
regularly
watered
the
sides
of
the
vale
are
until
you
come
down
to
within
about
six
or
eight
miles
of
southampton
hills
or
rising
grounds
of
chalk
covered
more
or
less
thickly
with
loam
where
the
hills
rise
up
very
steeply
from
the
valley
the
fertility
of
the
is
not
so
great
but
for
a
considerable
part
of
the
way
the
are
excellent
and
the
farmhouses
to
which
those
lands
belong
are
for
the
far
greater
part
under
covert
of
the
hills
on
the
edge
of
the
valley
soon
after
the
rising
of
the
stream
it
forms
itself
into
some
capital
ponds
at
alresford
these
doubtless
were
augmented
by
art
in
order
to
supply
winchester
with
fish
the
fertility
of
this
vale
and
of
the
surrounding
country
is
best
proved
by
the
fact
that
besides
the
town
of
alresford
and
that
of
southampton
there
are
seventeen
villages
each
having
its
parish
church
upon
its
borders
when
we
consider
these
things
we
are
not
surprised
that
a
spot
situated
about
half
way
down
this
vale
should
have
been
chosen
for
the
building
of
a
city
or
that
that
city
should
have
been
for
a
great
number
of
years
a
place
of
residence
for
the
kings
of
england
winchester
which
is
at
present
a
mere
nothing
to
what
it
once
was
stands
across
the
vale
at
a
place
where
the
vale
is
made
very
narrow
by
the
jutting
forward
of
two
immense
hills
from
the
point
where
the
river
passes
through
the
city
you
go
whether
eastward
or
westward
a
full
mile
up
a
very
steep
hill
all
the
way
the
city
is
of
course
in
one
of
the
deepest
holes
that
can
be
imagined
it
never
could
have
been
thought
of
as
a
place
to
be
defended
since
the
discovery
of
gunpowder
and
indeed
one
would
think
that
very
considerable
annoyance
might
be
given
to
the
inhabitants
even
by
the
flinging
of
the
from
the
hills
down
into
the
city
at
ropley
dean
before
i
mounted
the
hill
to
come
on
towards
rotherham
park
i
baited
my
horse
here
the
ground
is
precisely
like
that
at
ashmansworth
on
the
borders
of
berkshire
which
indeed
i
could
see
from
the
ground
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
in
coming
up
the
hill
i
had
the
house
and
farm
of
duthy
to
my
right
seeing
some
very
fine
swedish
turnips
i
naturally
expected
that
they
belonged
to
this
gentleman
who
is
secretary
to
the
agricultural
society
of
hampshire
but
i
found
that
they
belonged
to
a
farmer
mayhew
the
soil
is
along
upon
this
high
land
a
deep
loam
bordering
on
a
clay
red
in
colour
and
pretty
full
of
large
rough
stones
very
much
like
some
of
the
land
in
huntingdonshire
but
here
is
a
bed
of
chalk
under
this
everything
is
backward
here
the
wheat
is
perfectly
green
in
most
places
but
it
is
everywhere
pretty
good
i
have
observed
all
the
way
along
that
the
wheat
is
good
upon
the
stiff
strong
land
it
is
so
here
but
it
is
very
backward
the
greater
part
of
it
is
full
three
weeks
behind
the
wheat
under
portsdown
hill
but
few
farmhouses
come
within
my
sight
along
here
but
in
one
of
them
there
was
a
which
is
the
third
i
have
seen
since
i
quitted
the
wen
in
descending
from
this
high
ground
in
order
to
reach
the
village
of
east
tisted
which
lies
on
the
turnpike
road
from
the
wen
to
gosport
through
alton
i
had
to
cross
rotherham
park
on
the
right
of
the
park
on
a
bank
of
land
facing
the
i
saw
a
very
pretty
farmhouse
having
everything
in
excellent
order
with
fine
about
it
and
with
a
standing
in
the
yard
this
farm
as
i
afterwards
found
belongs
to
the
owner
of
rotherham
park
who
is
also
the
owner
of
east
tisted
who
has
recently
built
a
new
house
in
the
park
who
has
quite
metamorphosed
the
village
of
tisted
within
these
eight
years
who
has
indeed
really
and
truly
improved
the
whole
country
just
round
about
here
whose
name
is
scot
well
known
as
a
brickmaker
at
north
end
fulham
and
who
has
in
hampshire
supplanted
a
norman
of
the
name
of
powlet
the
process
by
which
this
transfer
has
taken
place
is
visible
enough
to
all
eyes
but
the
eyes
of
the
jolterheads
had
there
been
no
debt
created
to
crush
liberty
in
france
and
to
keep
down
reformers
in
england
scot
would
not
have
had
bricks
to
burn
to
build
houses
for
the
jews
and
jobbers
and
other
eaters
of
taxes
and
the
norman
powlet
would
not
have
had
to
pay
in
taxes
through
his
own
hands
and
those
of
his
tenants
and
labourers
the
amount
of
the
estate
at
tisted
first
to
be
given
to
the
jews
jobbers
and
and
then
by
them
to
be
given
to
scot
for
his
bricks
however
it
is
not
scot
who
has
assisted
to
pass
laws
to
make
people
pay
double
toll
on
a
sunday
scot
had
nothing
to
do
with
passing
the
new
and
old
ellenborough
act
scot
never
invented
the
new
trespass
law
in
virtue
of
which
john
cockbain
of
whitehaven
in
the
county
of
cumberland
was
by
two
clergymen
and
three
other
magistrates
of
that
county
sentenced
to
pay
one
for
damages
and
seven
shillings
costs
for
going
upon
a
field
the
property
of
william
earl
of
lonsdale
in
the
passing
of
this
act
which
was
one
of
the
first
passed
in
the
present
reign
scot
the
brickmaker
had
nothing
to
do
go
on
good
thrust
out
some
more
of
the
normans
with
the
fruits
of
the
augmentations
which
you
make
to
the
wen
go
and
take
from
them
their
mansions
parks
and
villages
at
tisted
i
crossed
the
turnpike
road
before
mentioned
and
entered
a
lane
which
at
the
end
of
about
four
miles
brought
me
to
this
village
of
selborne
my
readers
will
recollect
that
i
mentioned
this
selborne
when
i
was
giving
an
account
of
hawkley
hanger
last
fall
i
was
desirous
of
seeing
this
village
about
which
i
have
read
in
the
book
of
white
and
which
a
reader
has
been
so
good
as
to
send
me
from
tisted
i
came
generally
up
hill
till
i
got
within
half
a
mile
of
this
village
when
all
of
a
sudden
i
came
to
the
edge
of
a
hill
looked
down
over
all
the
larger
vale
of
which
the
little
vale
of
this
village
makes
a
part
here
hindhead
and
hill
came
full
in
my
view
when
i
was
crossing
the
forest
in
sussex
going
from
worth
to
horsham
these
two
great
hills
lay
to
my
west
and
i
am
got
just
on
the
opposite
side
of
them
and
see
them
of
course
towards
the
east
and
the
while
leith
hill
lies
away
towards
the
this
hill
from
which
you
descend
down
into
selborne
is
very
lofty
but
indeed
we
are
here
amongst
some
of
the
highest
hills
in
the
island
and
amongst
the
sources
of
rivers
the
hill
over
which
i
have
come
this
morning
sends
the
itchen
river
forth
from
one
side
of
it
and
the
river
wey
which
rises
near
alton
from
the
opposite
side
of
it
hindhead
which
lies
before
me
sends
as
i
observed
upon
a
former
occasion
the
arun
forth
towards
the
south
and
a
stream
forth
towards
the
north
which
meets
the
river
wey
somewhere
above
godalming
i
am
told
that
the
springs
of
these
two
streams
rise
in
the
hill
of
hindhead
or
rather
on
one
side
of
the
hill
at
not
many
yards
from
each
other
the
village
of
selborne
is
precisely
what
it
is
described
by
white
a
straggling
irregular
street
bearing
all
the
marks
of
great
antiquity
and
showing
from
its
lanes
and
its
vicinage
generally
that
it
was
once
a
very
considerable
place
i
went
to
look
at
the
spot
where
white
supposes
the
convent
formerly
stood
it
is
very
beautiful
nothing
can
surpass
in
beauty
these
dells
and
hillocks
and
hangers
which
last
are
so
steep
that
it
is
impossible
to
ascend
them
except
by
means
of
a
serpentine
path
i
found
here
deep
hollow
ways
with
beds
and
sides
of
solid
white
stone
but
not
quite
so
white
and
so
solid
i
think
as
the
stone
which
i
found
in
the
roads
at
hawkley
the
churchyard
of
selborne
is
most
beautifully
situated
the
land
is
good
all
about
it
the
trees
are
luxuriant
and
prone
to
be
lofty
and
large
i
measured
the
in
the
churchyard
and
found
the
trunk
to
be
according
to
my
measurement
feet
eight
inches
in
circumference
the
trunk
is
very
short
as
is
generally
the
case
with
but
the
head
spreads
to
a
very
great
extent
and
the
whole
tree
though
probably
several
centuries
old
appears
to
be
in
perfect
health
here
are
several
in
and
about
this
village
but
for
this
once
the
prayers
of
the
men
will
be
granted
and
the
devil
of
any
hops
there
will
be
the
bines
are
scarcely
got
up
the
poles
the
bines
and
the
leaves
are
black
nearly
as
soot
full
as
black
as
a
sooty
bag
or
dingy
and
covered
with
lice
it
is
a
pity
that
these
could
not
have
a
parcel
of
spaniards
and
portuguese
to
louse
their
hops
for
them
pretty
devils
to
have
liberty
when
a
favourite
recreation
of
the
donna
is
to
crack
the
lice
in
the
head
of
the
don
i
really
shrug
up
my
shoulders
thinking
of
the
beasts
very
different
from
such
is
my
landlady
here
at
selborne
who
while
i
am
writing
my
notes
is
getting
me
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
has
already
covered
the
table
with
a
nice
clean
cloth
i
have
never
seen
such
quantities
of
grapes
upon
any
vines
as
i
see
upon
the
vines
in
this
village
badly
pruned
as
all
the
vines
have
been
to
be
sure
this
is
a
year
for
grapes
such
i
believe
as
has
been
seldom
known
in
england
and
the
cause
is
the
perfect
ripening
of
the
wood
by
the
last
beautiful
summer
i
am
afraid
however
that
the
grapes
come
in
vain
for
this
summer
has
been
so
cold
and
is
now
so
wet
that
we
can
hardly
expect
grapes
which
are
not
under
glass
to
ripen
as
i
was
coming
into
this
village
i
observed
to
a
farmer
who
was
standing
at
his
gateway
that
people
ought
to
be
happy
here
for
that
god
had
done
everything
for
them
his
answer
was
that
he
did
not
believe
there
was
a
more
unhappy
place
in
england
for
that
there
were
always
quarrels
of
some
sort
or
other
going
on
this
made
me
call
to
mind
the
king
proclamation
relative
to
a
reward
for
discovering
the
person
who
had
recently
at
the
parson
of
this
this
parson
name
is
cobbold
and
it
really
appears
that
there
was
a
shot
fired
through
his
window
he
has
had
with
the
people
and
i
imagine
that
it
was
these
to
which
the
farmer
alluded
the
hops
are
of
considerable
importance
to
the
village
and
their
failure
must
necessarily
be
attended
with
consequences
very
inconvenient
to
the
whole
of
a
population
so
small
as
this
upon
inquiry
i
find
that
the
hops
are
equally
bad
at
alton
froyle
crondall
and
even
at
farnham
i
saw
them
bad
in
sussex
i
hear
that
they
are
bad
in
kent
so
that
at
any
rate
will
be
for
once
free
from
the
dreadful
evils
of
abundance
a
correspondent
asks
me
what
is
meant
by
the
statements
which
he
sees
in
the
relative
to
the
he
sees
it
he
says
continually
falling
in
amount
and
he
wonders
what
this
means
the
thing
has
not
indeed
been
properly
explained
it
is
a
and
it
is
hardly
right
for
me
to
state
in
a
publication
like
the
anything
relative
to
a
gamble
however
the
case
is
this
a
taxing
system
is
necessarily
a
system
of
gambling
a
system
of
betting
is
no
more
than
a
system
of
betting
and
the
wretched
dogs
that
carry
on
the
traffic
are
little
more
except
that
they
are
more
criminal
than
the
waiters
at
an
o
or
the
markers
at
billiards
the
hop
duty
is
so
much
per
pound
the
duty
was
imposed
at
two
separate
times
one
part
of
it
therefore
is
called
the
old
duty
and
the
other
part
the
new
duty
the
old
duty
was
a
penny
to
the
pound
of
hops
the
amount
of
this
duty
which
can
always
be
ascertained
at
the
treasury
as
soon
as
the
hopping
season
is
over
is
the
surest
possible
guide
in
ascertaining
the
total
amount
of
the
growth
of
hops
for
the
year
if
for
instance
the
duty
were
to
amount
to
no
more
than
eight
shillings
and
fourpence
you
would
be
certain
that
only
a
hundred
pounds
of
hops
had
been
grown
during
the
year
hence
a
system
of
gambling
precisely
like
the
gambling
in
the
funds
i
bet
you
that
the
duty
will
not
exceed
so
much
the
duty
has
sometimes
exceeded
two
hundred
thousand
pounds
this
year
it
is
supposed
that
it
will
not
exceed
twenty
thirty
or
forty
thousand
the
gambling
fellows
are
betting
all
this
time
and
it
is
in
fact
an
account
of
the
betting
which
is
inserted
in
the
this
vile
and
this
system
of
dutch
descent
begotten
by
bishop
burnet
and
born
in
hell
this
system
has
turned
everything
into
a
gamble
there
are
hundreds
of
men
who
live
by
being
the
agents
to
carry
on
gambling
they
reside
here
in
the
wen
many
of
the
gamblers
live
in
the
country
they
write
up
to
their
gambling
agent
whom
they
call
their
stockbroker
he
gambles
according
to
their
order
and
they
receive
the
profit
or
stand
to
the
loss
is
it
possible
to
conceive
a
viler
calling
than
that
of
an
agent
for
the
carrying
on
of
gambling
and
yet
the
vagabonds
call
themselves
gentlemen
or
at
least
look
upon
themselves
as
the
superiors
of
those
who
sweep
the
kennels
in
like
manner
is
the
carried
on
the
gambling
agents
in
the
wen
make
the
bets
for
the
gamblers
in
the
country
and
perhaps
millions
are
betted
during
the
year
upon
the
amount
of
a
duty
which
at
the
most
scarcely
exceeds
a
quarter
of
a
million
in
such
a
state
of
things
how
are
you
to
expect
young
men
to
enter
on
a
course
of
patient
industry
how
are
you
to
expect
that
they
will
seek
to
acquire
fortune
and
fame
by
study
or
by
application
of
any
kind
looking
back
over
the
road
that
i
have
come
and
perceiving
the
direction
of
the
road
going
from
this
village
in
another
direction
i
perceive
that
this
is
a
very
direct
road
from
winchester
to
farnham
the
road
too
appears
to
have
been
from
ancient
times
sufficiently
wide
and
when
the
bishop
of
winchester
selected
this
beautiful
spot
whereon
to
erect
a
monastery
i
dare
say
the
roads
along
here
were
some
of
the
best
in
the
country
surrey
thursday
i
got
a
boy
at
selborne
to
show
me
along
the
lanes
out
into
woolmer
forest
on
my
way
to
headley
the
lanes
were
very
deep
the
wet
just
about
the
colour
of
mixed
up
with
water
and
just
about
as
clammy
came
in
many
places
very
nearly
up
to
my
horse
belly
there
was
this
comfort
however
that
i
was
sure
that
there
was
a
bottom
which
is
by
no
means
the
case
when
you
are
among
clays
or
after
going
through
these
lanes
and
along
between
some
i
came
out
upon
woolmer
forest
and
to
my
great
satisfaction
soon
found
myself
on
the
side
of
those
identical
plantations
which
have
been
made
under
the
orders
of
the
smooth
huskisson
and
which
i
noticed
last
year
in
my
ride
from
hambledon
to
this
place
these
plantations
are
of
fir
or
at
least
i
could
see
nothing
else
and
they
never
can
be
of
any
more
use
to
the
nation
than
the
sprigs
of
heath
which
cover
the
rest
of
the
forest
is
there
nobody
to
inquire
what
becomes
of
the
income
of
the
crown
lands
no
and
there
never
will
be
until
the
whole
system
be
changed
i
have
seldom
ridden
on
pleasanter
ground
than
that
which
i
found
between
woolmer
forest
and
this
beautiful
village
of
thursley
the
day
has
been
fine
too
notwithstanding
i
saw
the
judges
terrific
wigs
as
i
came
up
upon
the
turnpike
road
from
the
village
of
itchen
i
had
but
one
little
scud
during
the
day
just
enough
for
swithin
to
swear
by
but
when
i
was
upon
the
hills
i
saw
some
showers
going
about
the
country
from
selborne
i
had
first
to
come
to
headley
about
five
miles
i
came
to
the
identical
where
i
took
my
blind
guide
last
year
who
took
me
such
a
dance
to
the
southward
and
led
me
up
to
the
top
of
hindhead
at
last
i
had
no
business
there
my
route
was
through
a
sort
of
hamlet
called
churt
which
lies
along
on
the
side
and
towards
the
foot
of
the
north
of
hindhead
on
which
side
also
lies
the
village
of
thursley
a
line
is
hardly
more
straight
than
is
the
road
from
headley
to
thursley
and
a
prettier
ride
i
never
had
in
the
course
of
my
life
it
was
not
the
less
interesting
from
the
circumstance
of
its
giving
me
all
the
way
a
full
view
of
crooksbury
hill
the
grand
scene
of
my
exploits
when
i
was
a
taker
of
the
nests
of
crows
and
magpies
at
churt
i
had
upon
my
left
three
hills
out
upon
the
common
called
the
the
unitarians
will
not
believe
in
the
trinity
because
they
can
not
account
for
it
will
they
come
here
to
churt
go
and
look
at
these
devil
jumps
and
account
to
me
for
the
placing
of
these
three
hills
in
the
shape
of
three
rather
squat
along
in
a
line
upon
this
heath
or
the
placing
of
a
upon
the
top
of
one
of
them
as
big
as
a
church
tower
for
my
part
i
can
not
account
for
this
placing
of
these
hills
that
they
should
have
been
formed
by
mere
chance
is
hardly
to
be
believed
how
could
waters
rolling
about
have
formed
such
hills
how
could
such
hills
have
bubbled
up
from
beneath
but
in
short
it
is
all
wonderful
alike
the
stripes
of
loam
running
down
through
the
the
circular
parcels
of
loam
in
the
midst
of
the
lines
of
flint
running
parallel
with
each
other
horizontally
along
the
the
flints
placed
in
circles
as
true
as
a
hair
in
the
the
layers
of
stone
at
the
bottom
of
hills
of
loam
the
chalk
first
soft
then
some
miles
further
on
becoming
then
after
another
distance
becoming
as
they
call
it
and
at
last
becoming
hard
white
stone
fit
for
any
buildings
the
at
hindhead
becoming
harder
and
harder
till
it
becomes
very
nearly
iron
in
herefordshire
and
quite
iron
in
wales
but
indeed
they
once
dug
iron
out
of
this
very
hindhead
the
clouds
coming
and
settling
upon
the
hills
sinking
down
and
creeping
along
at
last
coming
out
again
in
springs
and
those
becoming
rivers
why
it
is
all
equally
wonderful
and
as
to
not
believing
in
this
or
that
because
the
thing
can
not
be
proved
by
logical
deduction
why
is
any
man
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
a
god
any
more
than
he
is
to
believe
in
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
for
my
part
i
think
the
devil
jumps
as
the
people
here
call
them
full
as
wonderful
and
no
more
wonderful
than
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
other
wonderful
things
it
is
a
strange
taste
which
our
ancestors
had
to
ascribe
no
inconsiderable
part
of
these
wonders
of
nature
to
the
devil
not
far
from
the
devil
jumps
is
that
singular
place
which
resembles
a
inverted
hollowed
out
and
an
outside
rim
only
left
this
is
called
the
punch
and
it
is
very
well
known
in
wiltshire
that
the
forming
or
perhaps
it
is
the
breaking
up
of
stonehenge
is
ascribed
to
the
devil
and
that
the
mark
of
one
of
his
feet
is
now
said
to
be
seen
in
one
of
the
stones
i
got
to
thursley
about
sunset
and
without
experiencing
any
inconvenience
from
the
wet
i
have
mentioned
the
state
of
the
corn
as
far
as
selborne
on
this
side
of
that
village
i
find
it
much
forwarder
than
i
found
it
between
selborne
and
ropley
dean
i
am
here
got
into
some
of
the
very
best
in
the
kingdom
a
fine
buttery
stoneless
loam
upon
a
bottom
of
sand
or
finer
barley
and
it
is
impossible
to
see
all
the
corn
is
good
here
the
wheat
not
a
heavy
crop
but
not
a
light
one
and
the
barley
all
the
way
along
from
headley
to
this
place
as
fine
if
not
finer
than
i
ever
saw
it
in
my
life
indeed
i
have
not
seen
a
bad
field
of
barley
since
i
left
the
wen
the
corn
is
not
so
forward
here
as
under
portsdown
hill
but
some
farmers
intend
to
begin
reaping
wheat
in
a
few
days
it
is
monstrous
to
suppose
that
the
price
of
corn
will
not
come
down
it
must
come
down
good
weather
or
bad
weather
if
the
weather
be
bad
it
will
be
so
much
the
worse
for
the
farmer
as
well
as
for
the
nation
at
large
and
can
be
of
no
benefit
to
any
human
being
but
the
quakers
who
must
now
be
pretty
busy
measuring
the
crops
all
over
the
kingdom
it
will
be
recollected
that
in
the
report
of
the
agricultural
committee
of
it
appeared
from
the
evidence
of
one
hodgson
a
partner
of
cropper
benson
and
quakers
of
liverpool
that
these
quakers
sent
a
set
of
into
the
several
counties
just
before
every
harvest
that
these
fellows
stopped
here
and
there
went
into
the
fields
measured
off
square
yards
of
wheat
clipped
off
the
ears
and
carried
them
off
these
they
afterwards
packed
up
and
sent
off
to
cropper
and
at
liverpool
when
the
whole
of
the
packets
were
got
together
they
were
rubbed
out
measured
weighed
and
an
estimate
made
of
the
amount
of
the
coming
crop
this
according
to
the
confession
of
hodgson
himself
enabled
these
quakers
to
speculate
in
corn
with
the
greater
chance
of
gain
this
has
been
done
by
these
men
for
many
years
their
disregard
of
worldly
things
their
desire
to
lay
up
treasures
in
heaven
their
implicit
yielding
to
the
spirit
these
have
induced
them
to
send
their
over
the
country
regularly
year
after
year
and
i
will
engage
that
they
are
at
it
at
this
moment
the
farmers
will
bear
in
mind
that
the
new
though
clearly
not
intended
for
any
such
purpose
enables
them
to
go
and
seize
by
the
throat
any
of
these
gaugers
that
they
may
catch
in
their
fields
they
could
not
do
this
formerly
to
cut
off
standing
corn
was
merely
a
trespass
for
which
satisfaction
was
to
be
attained
by
action
at
law
but
now
you
can
seize
the
caitiff
who
is
come
as
a
spy
amongst
your
corn
before
he
could
be
off
and
leave
you
to
find
out
his
name
as
you
could
but
now
you
can
lay
hold
of
him
as
deller
did
of
the
duke
man
and
bring
him
before
a
magistrate
at
once
i
do
hope
that
the
farmers
will
look
sharp
out
for
these
fellows
who
are
neither
more
nor
less
than
so
many
spies
they
hold
a
great
deal
of
corn
they
want
blight
mildew
rain
hurricanes
but
happy
i
am
to
see
that
they
will
get
no
blight
at
any
rate
the
grain
is
formed
everywhere
everybody
tells
me
that
there
is
no
blight
in
any
sort
of
corn
except
in
the
beans
i
have
not
gone
through
much
of
a
bean
country
the
beans
that
i
have
seen
are
some
of
them
pretty
good
more
of
them
but
middling
and
still
more
of
them
very
indifferent
i
am
very
happy
to
hear
that
that
beautiful
little
bird
the
american
partridge
has
been
introduced
with
success
to
this
neighbourhood
by
leech
at
lea
i
am
told
that
they
have
been
heard
whistling
this
summer
that
they
have
been
frequently
seen
and
that
there
is
no
doubt
that
they
have
broods
of
young
ones
i
tried
several
times
to
import
some
of
these
birds
but
i
always
lost
them
by
some
means
or
other
before
the
time
arrived
for
turning
them
out
they
are
a
beautiful
little
partridge
and
extremely
interesting
in
all
their
manner
some
persons
call
them
if
any
one
will
take
a
quail
and
compare
it
with
one
of
these
birds
he
will
see
that
they
can
not
be
of
the
same
sort
in
my
year
residence
in
america
i
have
i
think
clearly
proved
that
these
birds
are
partridges
and
not
quails
in
the
united
states
north
of
new
jersey
they
are
called
quail
south
and
of
new
jersey
they
are
called
partridges
they
have
been
called
quail
solely
on
account
of
their
size
for
they
have
none
of
the
manners
of
quail
belonging
to
them
quails
assemble
in
flocks
like
larks
starlings
or
rooks
partridges
keep
in
distinct
coveys
that
is
to
say
the
brood
lives
distinct
from
all
other
broods
until
the
ensuing
spring
when
it
forms
itself
into
pairs
and
separates
nothing
can
be
a
distinction
more
clear
than
this
our
own
partridges
stick
to
the
same
spot
from
the
time
that
they
are
hatched
to
the
time
that
they
pair
off
and
these
american
partridges
do
the
same
quails
like
larks
get
together
in
flocks
at
the
approach
of
winter
and
move
about
according
to
the
season
to
a
greater
or
less
distance
from
the
place
where
they
were
bred
these
therefore
which
have
been
brought
to
thursley
are
partridges
and
if
they
be
suffered
to
live
quietly
for
a
season
or
two
they
will
stock
the
whole
of
that
part
of
the
country
where
the
delightful
intermixture
of
coppices
heaths
ponds
and
rivulets
is
singularly
favourable
to
their
increase
the
turnips
can
not
fail
to
be
good
in
such
a
season
and
in
such
land
yet
the
farmers
are
most
dreadfully
tormented
with
the
weeds
and
with
the
superabundant
turnips
here
my
lord
liverpool
is
over
production
indeed
they
have
sown
their
fields
they
have
no
means
of
destroying
the
weeds
by
the
plough
they
have
no
intervals
to
bury
them
in
and
they
or
as
tull
calls
it
and
then
comes
swithin
and
sets
the
weeds
and
the
turnips
again
then
there
is
another
hoeing
or
scratching
and
then
comes
swithin
again
so
that
there
is
hoe
hoe
muddle
muddle
and
such
a
fretting
and
stewing
such
a
looking
up
to
hindhead
to
see
when
it
is
going
to
be
fine
when
if
that
beautiful
field
of
twenty
acres
which
i
have
now
before
my
eyes
and
wherein
i
see
half
a
dozen
men
hoeing
and
poking
and
muddling
looking
up
to
see
how
long
it
is
before
they
must
take
to
their
heels
to
get
under
the
trees
to
obtain
shelter
from
the
coming
shower
when
i
say
if
that
beautiful
field
had
been
sowed
upon
ridges
at
four
feet
apart
according
to
the
plan
in
my
not
a
weed
would
have
been
to
be
seen
in
the
field
the
would
have
been
three
times
the
size
that
they
now
are
the
expense
would
have
not
been
a
fourth
part
of
that
which
has
already
taken
place
and
all
the
muddling
and
poking
about
of
weeds
and
all
the
fretting
and
all
the
stewing
would
have
been
spared
and
as
to
the
amount
of
the
crop
i
am
now
looking
at
the
best
land
in
england
for
swedish
turnips
and
i
have
no
scruple
to
assert
that
if
it
had
been
sown
after
my
manner
it
would
have
had
a
crop
double
the
weight
of
that
which
it
now
will
have
i
think
i
know
of
a
field
of
turnips
sown
much
later
than
the
field
now
before
me
and
sown
in
rows
at
nearly
four
feet
apart
which
have
a
crop
double
the
weight
of
that
which
will
be
produced
in
yon
beautiful
field
surrey
friday
at
the
end
of
a
long
ride
but
a
most
delightful
ride
i
got
to
this
place
about
nine
in
the
evening
from
thursley
i
came
to
brook
and
there
crossed
the
from
london
to
chichester
through
godalming
and
midhurst
thence
i
came
on
turning
upon
the
left
upon
the
of
hambledon
in
surrey
mind
on
one
of
these
hills
is
one
of
those
precious
jobs
called
for
what
reason
this
pretty
name
is
given
to
a
sort
of
telegraph
house
stuck
up
at
public
expense
upon
a
high
hill
for
what
reason
this
outlandish
name
is
given
to
the
thing
i
must
leave
the
reader
to
guess
but
as
to
the
thing
itself
i
know
that
it
means
this
a
pretence
for
giving
a
good
sum
of
the
public
money
away
every
year
to
some
one
that
the
has
condemned
this
labouring
and
toiling
nation
to
provide
for
the
dead
weight
of
nearly
about
six
millions
sterling
a
year
that
is
to
say
this
curse
entailed
upon
the
country
on
account
of
the
late
wars
against
the
liberties
of
the
french
people
this
dead
weight
is
however
falling
in
part
at
least
upon
the
landed
jolterheads
who
were
so
eager
to
create
it
and
who
thought
that
no
part
of
it
would
fall
upon
themselves
theirs
has
been
a
grand
mistake
they
saw
the
war
carried
on
without
any
loss
or
any
cost
to
themselves
by
the
means
of
and
loans
the
labouring
classes
were
made
to
pay
the
whole
of
the
expenses
of
the
war
when
the
war
was
over
the
jolterheads
thought
they
would
get
gold
back
again
to
make
all
secure
and
some
of
them
really
said
i
am
told
that
it
was
high
time
to
put
an
end
to
the
gains
of
the
people
the
jolterheads
quite
overlooked
the
circumstance
that
in
returning
to
gold
they
doubled
and
trebled
what
they
had
to
pay
on
account
of
the
debt
and
that
at
last
they
were
bringing
the
burden
upon
themselves
grand
also
was
the
mistake
of
the
jolterheads
when
they
approved
of
the
squanderings
upon
the
dead
weight
they
thought
that
the
labouring
classes
were
going
to
pay
the
whole
of
the
expenses
of
the
knights
of
waterloo
and
of
the
other
heroes
of
the
war
the
jolterheads
thought
that
they
should
have
none
of
this
to
pay
some
of
them
had
relations
belonging
to
the
dead
weight
and
all
of
them
were
willing
to
make
the
labouring
classes
toil
like
asses
for
the
support
of
those
who
had
what
was
called
fought
and
bled
for
gatton
and
old
sarum
the
jolterheads
have
now
found
however
that
a
pretty
good
share
of
the
expense
is
to
fall
upon
themselves
their
mortagees
are
letting
them
know
that
and
such
pretty
things
cost
something
and
that
it
is
unreasonable
for
a
loyal
country
gentleman
a
friend
of
social
order
and
of
the
blessed
comforts
of
religion
to
expect
to
have
semaphores
and
to
keep
his
estate
too
this
dead
weight
is
unquestionably
a
thing
such
as
the
world
never
saw
before
here
are
not
only
a
tribe
of
pensioned
naval
and
military
officers
commissaries
quartermasters
pursers
and
god
knows
what
besides
not
only
these
but
their
wives
and
children
are
to
be
pensioned
after
the
death
of
the
heroes
themselves
nor
does
it
signify
it
seems
whether
the
hero
were
married
before
he
became
part
of
the
dead
weight
or
since
upon
the
death
of
the
man
the
pension
is
to
begin
with
the
wife
and
a
pension
for
each
child
so
that
if
there
be
a
large
family
of
children
the
family
in
many
cases
actually
gains
by
the
death
of
the
father
was
such
a
thing
as
this
ever
before
heard
of
in
the
world
any
man
that
is
going
to
die
has
nothing
to
do
but
to
marry
a
girl
to
give
her
a
pension
for
life
to
be
paid
out
of
the
sweat
of
the
people
and
it
was
distinctly
stated
during
the
session
of
parliament
before
the
last
that
the
widows
and
children
of
insane
officers
were
to
have
the
same
treatment
as
the
rest
here
is
the
envy
of
surrounding
nations
and
the
admiration
of
the
world
in
addition
then
to
twenty
thousand
parsons
more
than
twenty
thousand
and
perhaps
forty
or
fifty
thousand
thousands
upon
thousands
of
military
and
naval
officers
in
full
pay
in
addition
to
all
these
here
are
the
thousands
upon
thousands
of
pairs
of
this
dead
weight
all
busily
engaged
in
breeding
gentlemen
and
ladies
and
all
while
malthus
is
wanting
to
put
a
check
upon
the
breeding
of
the
labouring
classes
all
receiving
a
for
where
is
malthus
where
is
this
parson
where
are
his
friends
the
edinburgh
reviewers
faith
i
believe
they
have
given
him
up
they
begin
to
be
ashamed
of
giving
countenance
to
a
man
who
wants
to
check
the
breeding
of
those
who
labour
while
he
says
not
a
word
about
those
two
hundred
thousand
breeding
pairs
whose
offspring
are
necessarily
to
be
maintained
at
the
public
charge
well
may
these
fatteners
upon
the
labour
of
others
rail
against
the
radicals
let
them
once
take
the
fan
to
their
hand
and
they
will
i
warrant
it
thoroughly
purge
the
floor
however
it
is
a
consolation
to
know
that
the
jolterheads
who
have
been
the
promoters
of
the
measures
that
have
led
to
these
heavy
charges
it
is
a
consolation
to
know
that
the
jolterheads
have
now
to
bear
part
of
the
charges
and
that
they
can
not
any
longer
make
them
fall
exclusively
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
labouring
classes
the
disgust
that
one
feels
at
seeing
the
whiskers
and
hearing
the
copper
heels
rattle
is
in
some
measure
compensated
for
by
the
reflection
that
the
expense
of
them
is
now
beginning
to
fall
upon
the
malignant
and
tyrannical
jolterheads
who
are
the
principal
cause
of
their
being
created
bidding
the
i
came
along
by
the
church
at
hambledon
and
then
crossed
a
little
common
and
the
from
london
to
chichester
through
godalming
and
petworth
not
midhurst
as
before
the
here
is
one
of
the
best
that
i
ever
saw
it
is
like
the
road
upon
horley
common
near
worth
and
like
that
between
godstone
and
east
grinstead
and
the
cause
of
this
is
that
it
is
made
of
precisely
the
same
sort
of
stone
which
they
tell
me
is
brought
in
some
cases
even
from
blackdown
hill
which
can
not
be
less
i
should
think
than
twelve
miles
distant
this
stone
is
brought
in
great
lumps
and
then
cracked
into
little
pieces
the
next
village
i
came
to
after
hambledon
was
hascomb
famous
for
its
insomuch
that
it
is
called
there
are
two
lofty
hills
here
between
which
you
go
out
of
the
sandy
country
down
into
the
weald
here
are
hills
of
all
heights
and
forms
whether
they
came
in
consequence
of
a
boiling
of
the
earth
i
know
not
but
in
form
they
very
much
resemble
the
bubbles
upon
the
top
of
the
water
of
a
pot
which
is
violently
boiling
the
soil
is
a
beautiful
loam
upon
a
bed
of
sand
springs
start
here
and
there
at
the
feet
of
the
hills
and
little
rivulets
pour
away
in
all
directions
the
roads
are
difficult
merely
on
account
of
their
extreme
unevenness
the
bottom
is
everywhere
sound
and
everything
that
meets
the
eye
is
beautiful
trees
coppices
meadows
and
then
the
distant
views
in
every
direction
from
one
spot
i
saw
this
morning
hindhead
blackdown
hill
lord
egremont
house
and
park
at
petworth
donnington
hill
over
which
i
went
to
go
on
the
south
downs
the
south
downs
near
lewes
the
forest
at
worth
turner
hill
and
then
all
the
way
round
into
kent
and
back
to
the
surrey
hills
at
godstone
from
hascomb
i
began
to
descend
into
the
low
country
i
had
leith
hill
before
me
but
my
plan
was
not
to
go
over
it
or
any
part
of
it
but
to
go
along
below
it
in
the
real
weald
of
surrey
a
little
way
back
from
hascomb
i
had
seen
field
of
and
now
i
was
descending
into
a
country
where
strictly
speaking
only
three
things
will
grow
well
grass
wheat
and
oak
trees
at
goose
green
i
crossed
a
leading
from
guildford
to
horsham
and
arundel
i
next
came
after
crossing
a
canal
to
a
common
called
smithwood
common
leith
hill
was
full
in
front
of
me
but
i
turned
away
to
the
right
and
went
through
the
lanes
to
come
to
ewhurst
leaving
crawley
to
my
right
before
i
got
to
ewhurst
i
crossed
another
leading
from
guildford
to
horsham
and
going
on
to
worthing
or
some
of
those
towns
at
ewhurst
which
is
a
very
pretty
village
and
the
church
of
which
is
most
delightfully
situated
i
treated
my
horse
to
some
oats
and
myself
to
a
rasher
of
bacon
i
had
now
to
come
according
to
my
project
round
among
the
lanes
at
about
a
couple
of
miles
distance
from
the
foot
of
leith
hill
in
order
to
get
first
to
ockley
then
to
holmwood
and
then
to
reigate
from
ewhurst
the
first
three
miles
was
the
deepest
clay
that
i
ever
saw
to
the
best
of
my
recollection
i
was
warned
of
the
difficulty
of
getting
along
but
i
was
not
to
be
frightened
at
the
sound
of
clay
wagons
too
had
been
dragged
along
the
lanes
by
some
means
or
another
and
where
a
could
go
my
horse
could
go
it
took
me
however
a
good
hour
and
a
half
to
get
along
these
three
miles
now
mind
this
is
the
real
where
the
clay
is
where
there
is
no
stone
of
any
sort
underneath
as
at
worth
and
all
along
from
crawley
to
billingshurst
through
horsham
this
clayey
land
is
fed
with
water
soaking
from
the
and
in
this
particular
place
from
the
immense
hill
of
leith
all
along
here
the
are
beautiful
i
saw
scores
of
acres
by
the
where
the
young
oaks
stood
as
regularly
as
if
they
had
been
planted
the
orchards
are
not
bad
along
here
and
perhaps
they
are
a
good
deal
indebted
to
the
shelter
they
receive
the
wheat
very
good
all
through
the
weald
but
backward
at
ockley
i
passed
the
house
of
a
mr
steer
who
has
a
great
quantity
of
which
is
very
pretty
here
i
came
along
the
that
leads
from
dorking
to
horsham
when
i
got
within
about
two
or
three
miles
of
dorking
i
turned
off
to
the
right
came
across
the
holmwood
into
the
lanes
leading
down
to
gadbrook
common
which
has
of
late
years
been
enclosed
it
is
all
clay
here
but
in
the
whole
of
my
ride
i
have
not
seen
much
finer
fields
of
wheat
than
i
saw
here
out
of
these
lanes
i
turned
up
to
betchworth
i
believe
it
is
and
from
betchworth
came
along
a
to
my
left
and
the
to
my
right
till
i
got
to
this
place
sunday
i
stayed
at
reigate
yesterday
and
came
to
the
wen
every
step
of
the
way
in
a
rain
as
good
a
soaking
as
any
devotee
of
swithin
ever
underwent
for
his
sake
i
promised
that
i
would
give
an
account
of
the
effect
which
the
soaking
on
the
south
downs
on
saturday
the
instant
had
upon
the
i
do
not
recommend
the
remedy
to
others
but
this
i
will
say
that
i
had
a
spell
of
the
the
day
before
i
got
that
soaking
and
that
i
have
not
had
a
single
spell
since
though
i
have
slept
in
several
different
beds
and
got
a
second
soaking
in
going
from
botley
to
easton
the
truth
is
i
believe
that
rain
upon
the
south
downs
or
at
any
place
near
the
sea
is
by
no
means
the
same
thing
with
rain
in
the
interior
no
man
ever
catches
cold
from
getting
wet
with
and
indeed
i
have
never
known
an
instance
of
a
man
catching
cold
at
sea
the
air
upon
the
south
downs
is
saltish
i
dare
say
and
the
clouds
may
bring
something
a
little
partaking
of
the
nature
of
at
thursley
i
left
the
poking
and
pulling
and
muddling
about
the
weeds
and
wholly
incapable
after
all
of
putting
the
turnips
in
anything
like
the
state
in
which
they
ought
to
be
the
weeds
that
had
been
hoed
up
twice
were
growing
again
and
it
was
the
same
with
the
turnips
that
had
been
hoed
up
in
leaving
reigate
this
morning
it
was
with
great
pleasure
that
i
saw
a
field
of
swedish
turnips
drilled
upon
ridges
at
about
four
feet
distance
the
whole
field
as
clean
as
the
cleanest
of
garden
ground
the
turnips
standing
at
equal
distances
in
the
row
and
having
the
appearance
of
being
in
every
respect
in
a
prosperous
state
i
should
not
be
afraid
to
bet
that
these
turnips
thus
standing
in
rows
at
nearly
four
feet
distance
will
be
a
crop
twice
as
large
as
any
in
the
parish
of
thursley
though
there
is
i
imagine
some
of
the
finest
in
the
kingdom
it
seems
strange
that
men
are
not
to
be
convinced
of
the
advantage
of
the
for
turnips
they
will
insist
upon
believing
that
there
is
some
they
will
also
insist
upon
believing
that
the
is
the
most
expensive
how
can
there
be
ground
lost
if
the
crop
be
larger
and
as
to
the
expense
take
one
year
with
another
the
method
must
be
twice
as
expensive
as
the
other
wet
as
it
has
been
i
took
time
to
look
well
about
me
as
i
came
along
the
wheat
even
in
this
ragamuffin
part
of
the
country
is
good
with
the
exception
of
one
piece
which
lies
on
your
left
hand
as
you
come
down
from
banstead
down
it
is
very
good
at
banstead
itself
though
that
is
a
country
sufficiently
poor
just
on
the
other
side
of
sutton
there
is
a
little
good
land
and
in
a
place
or
two
i
thought
i
saw
the
wheat
a
little
blighted
a
labouring
man
told
me
that
it
was
where
the
heaps
of
dung
had
been
laid
the
barley
here
is
most
beautiful
as
indeed
it
is
all
over
the
country
between
sutton
and
the
wen
there
is
in
fact
little
besides
houses
gardens
grass
plats
and
other
matters
to
accommodate
the
jews
and
jobbers
and
the
mistresses
and
bastards
that
are
put
out
but
in
a
dell
which
the
crosses
about
a
mile
on
this
side
of
sutton
there
are
two
fields
of
as
stiff
land
i
think
as
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
in
summer
time
this
land
bakes
so
hard
that
they
can
not
plough
it
unless
it
be
wet
when
you
have
ploughed
it
and
the
sun
comes
again
it
bakes
again
one
of
these
fields
had
been
thus
ploughed
and
in
the
month
of
june
and
i
saw
the
ground
when
it
was
lying
in
lumps
of
the
size
of
portmanteaus
and
not
very
small
ones
either
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
reduce
this
ground
to
small
particles
except
by
the
means
of
sledge
hammers
the
two
fields
to
which
i
alluded
just
now
are
alongside
of
this
ploughed
field
and
they
are
now
in
wheat
the
heavy
rain
of
aided
by
the
wind
made
the
wheat
bend
pretty
nearly
to
lying
down
but
you
shall
rarely
see
two
finer
fields
of
wheat
it
is
red
wheat
a
coarsish
kind
and
the
straw
stout
and
strong
but
the
ears
are
long
broad
and
full
and
i
did
not
perceive
anything
approaching
towards
a
speck
in
the
straw
such
land
as
this
such
very
stiff
land
seldom
carries
a
very
large
crop
but
i
should
think
that
these
fields
would
exceed
four
quarters
to
an
acre
and
the
wheat
is
by
no
means
so
backward
as
it
is
in
some
places
there
is
no
corn
that
i
recollect
from
the
spot
just
spoken
of
to
almost
the
street
of
kensington
i
came
up
by
earl
court
where
there
is
amongst
the
market
gardens
a
field
of
wheat
one
would
suppose
that
this
must
be
the
finest
wheat
in
the
world
by
no
means
it
rained
hard
to
be
sure
and
i
had
not
much
time
for
being
particular
in
my
survey
but
this
field
appears
to
me
to
have
some
blight
in
it
and
as
to
crop
whether
of
corn
or
of
straw
it
is
nothing
to
compare
to
the
general
run
of
the
wheat
in
the
wealds
of
sussex
or
of
surrey
what
then
is
it
if
compared
with
the
wheat
on
the
south
downs
under
portsdown
hill
on
the
at
havant
and
at
tichfield
and
along
on
the
banks
of
the
itchen
thus
i
have
concluded
this
rural
ride
from
the
wen
and
back
again
to
the
wen
being
taking
in
all
the
turnings
and
windings
as
near
as
can
be
two
hundred
miles
in
length
my
objects
were
to
ascertain
the
state
of
the
crops
both
of
hops
and
of
corn
the
is
soon
settled
for
there
will
be
no
hops
as
to
the
corn
my
remark
is
this
that
on
all
the
clays
on
all
the
stiff
lands
upon
the
chalk
on
all
the
rich
lands
indeed
but
more
especially
on
all
the
stiff
lands
the
wheat
is
as
good
as
i
recollect
ever
to
have
seen
it
and
has
as
much
straw
on
all
the
light
lands
and
poor
lands
the
wheat
is
thin
and
though
not
short
by
no
means
good
the
oats
are
pretty
good
almost
everywhere
and
i
have
not
seen
a
bad
field
of
barley
during
the
whole
of
my
ride
though
there
is
no
species
of
soil
in
england
except
that
of
the
fens
over
which
i
have
not
passed
the
state
of
the
farmers
is
much
worse
than
it
was
last
year
notwithstanding
the
ridiculous
falsehoods
of
the
london
newspapers
and
the
more
ridiculous
delusion
of
the
jolterheads
in
numerous
instances
the
farmers
who
continue
in
their
farms
have
ceased
to
farm
for
themselves
and
merely
hold
the
land
for
the
landlords
the
delusion
caused
by
the
rise
of
the
price
of
corn
has
pretty
nearly
vanished
already
and
if
swithin
would
but
get
out
of
the
way
with
his
drippings
for
about
a
month
this
delusion
would
disappear
never
to
return
in
the
meanwhile
however
the
london
newspapers
are
doing
what
they
can
to
keep
up
the
delusion
and
in
a
paper
called
weekly
edited
i
am
told
by
a
lawyer
in
that
stupid
paper
of
this
day
i
find
the
following
passage
so
late
as
january
last
the
average
price
of
wheat
was
per
quarter
and
on
the
ult
it
was
above
as
it
has
been
rising
ever
since
it
may
be
quoted
as
little
under
so
that
in
this
article
alone
there
is
a
rise
of
more
than
per
cent
under
these
circumstances
it
is
not
likely
that
we
shall
hear
anything
of
a
writer
of
considerable
talents
but
no
prophet
had
the
kingdom
by
a
confident
prediction
that
wheat
after
the
of
may
would
sink
to
per
bushel
and
that
under
the
effects
of
peel
bill
and
the
payments
in
cash
by
the
bank
of
england
it
would
again
exceed
that
nay
so
assured
was
cobbett
of
the
mathematical
certainty
of
his
deductions
on
the
subject
that
he
did
not
hesitate
to
make
use
of
the
following
language
farther
if
what
i
say
do
not
come
to
pass
i
will
give
any
one
leave
to
broil
me
on
a
gridiron
and
for
that
purpose
i
will
get
one
of
the
best
gridirons
i
can
possibly
get
made
and
it
shall
be
hung
out
as
near
to
my
premises
as
possible
in
the
strand
so
that
it
shall
be
seen
by
everybody
as
they
pass
along
the
of
may
has
now
passed
peel
bill
has
not
been
repealed
and
the
bank
of
england
has
paid
its
notes
in
cash
and
yet
wheat
has
risen
nearly
per
cent
here
is
a
tissue
of
falsehoods
but
only
think
of
a
country
being
by
the
prospect
of
a
low
price
of
provisions
when
such
an
idea
can
possibly
find
its
way
even
into
the
shallow
brain
of
a
lawyer
when
such
an
idea
can
possibly
be
put
into
print
at
any
rate
there
must
be
something
totally
wrong
in
the
state
of
the
country
here
is
this
lawyer
telling
his
readers
that
i
had
frightened
the
kingdom
by
saying
that
wheat
would
be
sold
at
four
shillings
a
bushel
again
i
say
that
there
must
be
something
wrong
something
greatly
out
of
place
some
great
disease
at
work
in
the
community
or
such
an
idea
as
this
could
never
have
found
its
way
into
the
head
of
a
lawyer
it
might
perhaps
have
entered
at
any
time
but
for
it
to
find
its
way
into
print
there
must
be
something
in
the
state
of
society
wholly
out
of
joint
as
to
the
rest
of
this
article
it
is
a
tissue
of
downright
lies
the
writer
says
that
the
price
of
wheat
is
shillings
a
quarter
the
fact
is
that
on
the
second
instant
the
price
was
shillings
and
and
it
is
now
about
two
shillings
less
than
that
then
again
this
writer
must
know
that
i
never
said
that
wheat
would
not
rise
above
four
shillings
a
bushel
but
that
on
the
contrary
i
always
expressly
said
that
the
price
would
be
affected
by
the
seasons
and
that
i
thought
that
the
price
would
vibrate
between
three
shillings
a
bushel
and
seven
shillings
a
bushel
then
again
peel
bill
has
in
part
been
repealed
if
it
had
not
there
could
have
been
no
small
note
in
circulation
at
this
day
so
that
this
lawyer
is
in
obedience
to
the
wishes
of
a
lady
i
have
been
reading
about
the
plans
of
owen
and
though
i
do
not
as
yet
see
my
way
clear
as
to
how
we
can
arrange
matters
with
regard
to
the
young
girls
and
the
young
fellows
i
am
quite
clear
that
his
institution
would
be
most
excellent
for
the
disposal
of
the
lawyers
one
of
his
squares
would
be
at
a
great
distance
from
all
other
habitations
in
the
midst
of
erskine
for
instance
mentioned
by
me
in
a
former
ride
and
nothing
could
be
so
fitting
his
lordship
long
having
been
called
father
of
the
in
the
midst
of
this
estate
with
no
town
or
village
within
miles
of
them
we
might
have
one
of
owen
squares
and
set
the
brotherhood
most
effectually
at
work
pray
can
any
one
pretend
to
say
that
a
spade
or
shovel
would
not
become
the
hands
of
this
editor
of
better
than
a
pen
however
these
miserable
falsehoods
can
cause
the
delusion
to
exist
but
for
a
very
short
space
of
time
the
quantity
of
the
harvest
will
be
great
if
the
quality
be
bad
owing
to
wet
weather
the
price
will
be
still
lower
than
it
would
have
been
in
case
of
dry
weather
the
price
therefore
must
come
down
and
if
the
newspapers
were
conducted
by
men
who
had
any
sense
of
honour
or
shame
those
men
must
be
covered
with
confusion
ride
through
the
part
of
sussex
and
all
across
kent
from
the
weald
of
sussex
to
dover
sussex
friday
august
i
have
so
often
described
the
soil
and
other
matters
appertaining
to
the
country
between
the
wen
and
this
place
that
my
readers
will
rejoice
at
being
spared
the
repetition
here
as
to
the
harvest
however
i
find
that
they
were
deluged
here
on
tuesday
last
though
we
got
but
little
comparatively
at
kensington
between
mitcham
and
sutton
they
were
making
the
corn
has
not
been
injured
here
worth
notice
now
and
then
an
ear
in
the
butts
and
grown
wheat
is
a
sad
thing
you
may
almost
as
well
be
without
wheat
altogether
however
very
little
harm
has
been
done
here
as
yet
at
walton
heath
i
saw
a
man
who
had
suffered
most
terribly
from
the
he
saw
me
going
by
and
came
out
to
tell
me
his
story
and
a
horrible
story
it
is
as
the
public
will
find
when
it
shall
come
regularly
and
fully
before
them
apropos
of
i
asked
who
was
at
the
somersetshire
assizes
the
other
day
a
correspondent
tells
me
that
it
was
judge
burrough
i
am
well
aware
that
as
this
correspondent
observes
gamekeepers
ought
not
to
be
this
is
not
the
point
it
is
not
a
in
the
usual
sense
of
that
word
it
is
a
man
seizing
another
without
a
warrant
that
is
what
it
is
and
this
and
old
ellenborough
act
are
in
england
and
things
of
which
the
laws
of
england
the
birthright
of
englishmen
knew
nothing
yet
farmer
voke
ought
not
to
have
shot
at
the
gamekeeper
or
seizer
without
warrant
he
ought
not
to
have
shot
at
him
and
he
would
not
had
it
not
been
for
the
law
that
put
him
in
danger
of
being
transported
on
the
evidence
of
this
man
so
that
it
is
clearly
the
terrible
law
that
in
these
cases
produces
the
violence
yet
admire
with
me
reader
the
singular
turn
of
the
mind
of
sir
james
mackintosh
whose
whole
soul
appears
to
have
been
long
bent
on
the
amelioration
of
the
penal
code
and
who
has
never
said
one
single
word
about
this
new
and
most
terrible
part
of
it
sir
james
after
years
of
incessant
toil
has
i
believe
succeeded
in
getting
a
repeal
of
the
laws
for
the
punishment
of
witchcraft
of
the
very
existence
of
which
laws
the
nation
was
unacquainted
but
the
devil
a
word
has
he
said
about
the
which
put
into
the
gaols
a
full
third
part
of
the
prisoners
and
to
hold
which
prisoners
the
gaols
have
actually
been
enlarged
in
all
parts
of
the
country
singular
turn
of
mind
singular
humanity
ah
sir
james
knows
very
well
what
he
is
at
he
understands
the
state
of
his
constituents
at
knaresborough
too
well
to
meddle
with
he
has
a
friend
i
dare
say
who
knows
more
about
than
he
does
however
the
poor
are
safe
thank
sir
james
for
that
carlile
sister
and
wright
are
in
gaol
and
may
be
there
for
life
but
the
poor
witches
are
safe
no
hypocrite
no
base
pretender
to
religion
no
atrocious
savage
wretch
who
would
murder
half
mankind
rather
than
not
live
on
the
labours
of
others
no
monster
of
this
kind
can
now
persecute
the
poor
witches
thanks
to
sir
james
who
has
obtained
security
for
them
in
all
their
rides
through
the
air
and
in
all
their
sailings
upon
the
horseponds
wells
kent
saturday
i
came
from
worth
about
seven
this
morning
passed
through
east
grinstead
over
holthigh
common
through
ashurst
and
thence
to
this
place
the
morning
was
very
fine
and
i
left
them
at
worth
making
a
there
was
no
show
for
rain
till
about
one
as
i
was
approaching
ashurst
the
shattering
that
came
at
first
i
thought
nothing
of
but
the
clouds
soon
grew
up
all
round
and
the
rain
set
in
for
the
afternoon
the
buildings
at
ashurst
which
is
the
first
parish
in
kent
on
quitting
sussex
are
a
mill
an
alehouse
a
church
and
about
six
or
seven
other
houses
i
stopped
at
the
alehouse
to
bait
my
horse
and
for
want
of
bacon
was
compelled
to
put
up
with
bread
and
cheese
for
myself
i
waited
in
vain
for
the
rain
to
cease
or
to
slacken
and
the
of
made
me
fear
as
to
a
so
about
five
i
without
great
coat
got
upon
my
horse
and
came
to
this
place
just
as
fast
and
no
faster
than
if
it
had
been
fine
weather
a
very
fine
soaking
if
the
south
downs
have
left
any
little
remnant
of
the
will
take
it
away
to
be
sure
i
made
not
the
least
haste
to
get
out
of
the
rain
i
stopped
here
and
there
as
usual
and
asked
questions
about
the
corn
the
hops
and
other
things
but
the
moment
i
got
in
i
got
a
good
fire
and
set
about
the
work
of
drying
in
good
earnest
it
costing
me
nothing
for
drink
i
can
afford
to
have
plenty
of
fire
i
have
not
been
in
the
house
an
hour
and
all
my
clothes
are
now
as
dry
as
if
they
had
never
been
wet
it
is
not
getting
wet
that
hurts
you
if
you
keep
moving
while
you
are
wet
it
is
the
suffering
of
yourself
to
be
while
the
wet
clothes
are
on
your
back
the
country
that
i
have
come
over
is
a
very
pretty
one
the
soil
is
a
pale
yellow
loam
looking
like
brick
earth
but
rather
sandy
but
the
bottom
is
a
softish
stone
where
you
go
through
hollow
ways
as
at
east
grinstead
the
sides
are
solid
rock
and
indeed
the
rocks
sometimes
on
the
sides
of
hills
show
themselves
above
ground
and
mixed
amongst
the
woods
make
very
interesting
objects
on
the
road
from
the
wen
to
brighton
through
godstone
and
over
turner
hill
and
which
road
i
crossed
this
morning
in
coming
from
worth
to
east
grinstead
on
that
road
which
goes
through
lindfield
and
which
is
by
far
the
pleasantest
from
the
wen
to
brighton
on
the
side
of
this
road
on
which
coaches
now
go
from
the
wen
to
brighton
there
is
a
long
chain
of
rocks
or
rather
rocky
hills
with
trees
growing
amongst
the
rocks
or
apparently
out
of
them
as
they
do
in
the
woods
near
ross
in
herefordshire
and
as
they
do
in
the
blue
mountains
in
america
where
you
can
see
no
earth
at
all
where
all
seems
rock
and
yet
where
the
trees
grow
most
beautifully
at
the
place
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
that
is
to
say
by
the
side
of
this
pleasant
road
to
brighton
and
between
turner
hill
and
lindfield
there
is
a
rock
which
they
call
that
is
to
say
a
rock
upon
another
having
nothing
else
to
rest
upon
and
the
top
one
being
longer
and
wider
than
the
top
of
the
one
it
lies
on
this
big
rock
is
no
trifling
concern
being
as
big
perhaps
as
a
not
very
small
house
how
then
this
big
upon
little
what
lifted
up
the
big
it
balances
itself
naturally
enough
but
what
tossed
it
up
i
do
not
like
to
a
parson
for
teaching
me
while
i
have
own
to
teach
me
but
if
any
parson
will
tell
me
big
upon
little
i
do
not
know
that
i
shall
grudge
him
a
trifle
and
if
he
can
not
tell
me
this
if
he
say
all
that
we
have
to
do
is
to
and
then
i
tell
him
that
i
can
admire
and
adore
without
his
and
that
i
will
keep
my
money
in
my
pocket
to
return
to
the
soil
of
this
country
it
is
such
a
loam
as
i
have
described
with
this
stone
beneath
sometimes
the
top
soil
is
lighter
and
sometimes
heavier
sometimes
the
stone
is
harder
and
sometimes
softer
but
this
is
the
general
character
of
it
all
the
way
from
worth
to
tonbridge
wells
this
land
is
what
may
be
called
the
the
wheat
crop
about
to
bushels
to
an
acre
on
an
average
of
years
the
grass
fields
not
bad
and
all
the
fields
will
grow
grass
i
mean
make
upland
meadows
the
woods
good
though
not
of
the
finest
the
land
seems
to
be
about
thus
divided
a
tenth
of
a
tenth
and
the
rest
these
make
very
pretty
surface
especially
as
it
is
a
rarity
to
see
a
and
as
nobody
is
so
beastly
as
to
trees
like
the
elms
near
the
wen
the
country
has
no
spot
in
it
yet
the
hills
are
not
high
my
road
was
a
gentle
rise
or
a
gentle
descent
all
the
way
continual
new
views
strike
the
eye
but
there
is
little
variety
in
them
all
is
pretty
but
nothing
strikingly
beautiful
the
labouring
people
look
pretty
well
they
have
pigs
they
invariably
do
best
in
the
and
and
countries
where
the
mighty
grasper
has
under
his
they
can
get
but
little
these
are
mere
parish
roads
but
they
are
very
good
while
i
was
at
the
alehouse
at
ashurst
i
heard
some
labouring
men
talking
about
the
roads
and
they
having
observed
that
the
parish
roads
had
become
so
wonderfully
better
within
the
last
seven
or
eight
years
i
put
in
my
word
and
said
it
is
odd
enough
too
that
the
parish
roads
should
become
and
as
the
farmers
become
and
they
looked
at
one
another
and
put
on
a
sort
of
look
for
my
observation
seemed
to
for
at
last
one
of
them
said
why
it
is
because
the
farmers
not
the
money
to
employ
and
so
they
are
put
on
the
roads
yes
said
i
but
they
must
pay
them
there
they
said
no
more
and
only
hard
at
one
they
had
probably
never
thought
about
this
before
they
seemed
puzzled
by
it
and
well
they
might
for
it
has
bothered
the
wigs
of
boroughmongers
parsons
and
lawyers
and
will
bother
them
yet
yes
this
country
now
contains
a
body
of
occupiers
of
the
land
who
suffer
the
land
to
go
to
decay
for
want
of
means
to
pay
a
sufficiency
of
labourers
and
at
the
same
time
are
compelled
to
pay
those
labourers
for
doing
that
which
is
of
no
use
to
the
occupiers
there
collective
wisdom
go
brag
of
that
call
that
the
envy
of
surrounding
nations
and
the
admiration
of
the
world
this
is
a
great
year
i
saw
them
hanging
very
thick
on
the
during
a
great
part
of
this
day
ride
and
they
put
me
in
mind
of
the
old
saying
that
a
great
year
is
a
great
year
for
that
class
whom
the
lawyers
in
their
latin
phrase
call
the
and
daughters
of
nobody
i
once
asked
a
farmer
who
had
often
been
overseer
of
the
poor
whether
he
really
thought
that
there
was
any
ground
for
this
old
saying
or
whether
he
thought
it
was
mere
banter
he
said
that
he
was
sure
that
there
were
good
grounds
for
it
and
he
even
cited
instances
in
proof
and
mentioned
one
particular
year
when
there
were
four
times
as
many
of
this
class
as
ever
had
been
born
in
a
year
in
the
parish
before
an
effect
which
he
ascribed
solely
to
the
crop
of
nuts
of
the
year
before
now
if
this
be
the
case
ought
not
parson
malthus
lawyer
scarlett
and
the
rest
of
that
tribe
to
turn
their
attention
to
the
the
too
with
that
holy
man
wilberforce
at
its
head
ought
to
look
out
sharp
after
these
mischievous
a
law
to
cause
them
all
to
be
grubbed
up
and
thrown
into
the
fire
would
certainly
be
far
less
unreasonable
than
many
things
which
we
have
seen
and
heard
of
the
corn
from
worth
to
this
place
is
pretty
good
the
farmers
say
it
is
a
small
crop
other
people
and
especially
the
labourers
say
that
it
is
a
good
crop
i
think
it
is
not
large
and
not
small
about
an
average
crop
perhaps
rather
less
for
the
land
is
rather
light
and
this
is
not
a
year
for
light
lands
but
there
is
no
blight
no
mildew
in
spite
of
all
the
prayers
of
the
loyal
the
wheat
about
a
third
cut
and
none
carried
no
other
corn
begun
upon
hops
very
bad
till
i
came
within
a
few
miles
of
this
place
when
i
saw
some
which
i
should
suppose
would
bear
about
six
hundredweight
to
the
acre
the
orchards
no
great
things
along
here
some
apples
here
and
there
but
small
and
stunted
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
seen
any
one
well
loaded
with
fine
apples
kent
sunday
here
i
am
after
a
most
delightful
ride
of
miles
through
frant
lamberhurst
goudhurst
milkhouse
street
benenden
and
rolvenden
by
making
a
great
stir
in
rousing
waiters
and
boots
and
maids
and
by
leaving
behind
me
the
name
of
a
d
d
noisy
troublesome
fellow
i
got
clear
of
and
out
of
the
contagion
of
its
inhabitants
time
enough
to
meet
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
on
the
hill
that
you
come
up
in
order
to
get
to
frant
which
is
a
most
beautiful
little
village
at
about
two
miles
from
here
the
land
belongs
i
suppose
to
lord
abergavenny
who
has
a
mansion
and
park
here
a
very
pretty
place
and
kept
seemingly
in
very
nice
order
i
saw
here
what
i
never
saw
before
the
bloom
of
the
we
wholly
overlook
but
it
is
a
very
pretty
thing
and
here
when
the
plantations
were
made
and
as
they
grew
up
heath
was
to
on
the
sides
of
the
roads
in
the
plantations
the
heath
is
not
so
much
of
a
dwarf
as
we
suppose
this
is
four
feet
high
and
being
in
full
bloom
it
makes
the
prettiest
border
that
can
be
imagined
this
place
of
lord
abergavenny
is
altogether
a
very
pretty
place
and
so
far
from
grudging
him
the
possession
of
it
i
should
feel
pleasure
at
seeing
it
in
his
possession
and
should
pray
god
to
preserve
it
to
him
and
from
the
unholy
and
ruthless
touch
of
the
jews
and
jobbers
but
i
can
not
forget
this
lord
i
can
not
forget
that
he
has
for
doing
nothing
received
of
the
public
money
more
than
sufficient
to
buy
such
an
estate
as
this
i
can
not
forget
that
this
estate
may
perhaps
have
actually
been
bought
with
that
money
not
being
able
to
forget
this
and
with
my
mind
filled
with
reflections
of
this
sort
i
got
up
to
the
church
at
frant
and
just
by
i
saw
a
with
this
motto
on
it
up
a
child
as
he
should
that
is
to
say
try
to
breed
up
the
boys
and
girls
of
this
village
in
such
a
way
that
they
may
never
know
anything
about
lord
abergavenny
sinecure
or
knowing
about
it
that
they
may
think
it
that
he
should
roll
in
wealth
coming
to
him
in
such
a
way
the
projectors
deceive
nobody
but
themselves
they
are
working
for
the
destruction
of
their
own
system
in
looking
back
over
i
can
not
but
admire
the
operation
of
the
gambling
system
this
little
is
a
thing
created
entirely
by
the
gamble
and
the
means
have
hitherto
come
out
of
the
wages
of
labour
these
means
are
coming
out
of
the
farmer
capital
and
out
of
the
landlord
estate
the
labourers
are
stripped
they
can
give
no
more
the
saddle
is
now
fixing
itself
upon
the
right
back
in
quitting
frant
i
descended
into
a
country
more
woody
than
that
behind
me
i
asked
a
man
whose
fine
woods
those
were
that
i
pointed
to
and
i
fairly
gave
when
he
said
the
marquis
camden
milton
talks
of
the
in
a
way
to
make
one
draw
in
one
shoulders
with
fear
and
i
appeal
to
any
one
who
has
been
at
sea
when
a
whale
has
come
near
the
ship
whether
he
has
not
at
the
first
sight
of
the
monster
made
a
sort
of
involuntary
movement
as
if
to
out
of
the
such
was
the
movement
that
i
now
made
however
soon
coming
to
myself
on
i
walked
my
horse
by
the
side
of
my
pedestrian
informant
it
is
bayham
abbey
that
this
great
and
awful
sinecure
placeman
owns
in
this
part
of
the
county
another
great
estate
he
owns
near
sevenoaks
but
here
alone
he
spreads
his
length
and
breadth
over
more
they
say
than
ten
or
twelve
thousand
acres
of
land
great
part
of
which
consists
of
but
indeed
what
estates
might
he
not
purchase
not
much
less
than
thirty
years
he
held
a
place
a
sinecure
place
that
yielded
him
about
thirty
thousand
pounds
at
any
rate
he
according
to
parliamentary
accounts
has
received
of
public
money
little
short
of
a
million
of
guineas
these
at
guineas
an
acre
would
buy
thirty
thousand
acres
of
land
and
what
did
he
have
all
this
money
answer
me
that
question
wilberforce
you
who
called
him
a
bright
star
when
he
gave
up
of
his
enormous
sinecure
he
gave
up
all
but
the
sum
of
nearly
three
thousand
pounds
what
a
bright
star
and
did
he
give
it
up
when
the
had
made
the
country
ring
with
it
when
his
name
was
by
their
means
getting
into
every
mouth
in
the
kingdom
when
every
radical
speech
and
petition
contained
the
name
of
camden
then
it
was
and
not
till
then
that
this
bright
star
let
fall
part
of
its
brilliancy
so
that
wilberforce
ought
to
have
thanked
the
and
not
camden
when
he
let
go
his
grasp
he
talked
of
the
merits
of
his
father
his
father
was
a
lawyer
who
was
exceedingly
well
paid
for
what
he
did
without
a
million
of
money
being
given
to
his
son
but
there
is
something
rather
out
of
to
be
observed
about
this
father
this
father
was
the
contemporary
of
yorke
who
became
lord
hardwicke
pratt
and
yorke
and
the
merit
of
pratt
was
that
he
was
constantly
opposed
to
the
principles
of
yorke
yorke
was
called
a
and
pratt
a
but
the
devil
of
it
was
both
got
to
be
lords
and
in
one
shape
or
another
the
families
of
both
have
from
that
day
to
this
been
receiving
great
parcels
of
the
public
money
beautiful
system
the
tories
were
for
the
whigs
were
for
the
ministers
all
in
good
time
humoured
both
parties
and
the
stupid
people
divided
into
of
two
actually
applauded
now
one
part
of
them
and
now
the
other
part
of
them
the
squandering
away
of
their
substance
they
were
like
the
man
and
his
wife
in
the
fable
who
to
spite
one
another
gave
away
to
the
cunning
mumper
the
whole
of
their
dinner
bit
by
bit
of
folly
is
over
at
any
rate
the
people
are
no
longer
fools
enough
to
be
they
make
no
distinctions
the
nonsense
about
court
party
and
country
party
is
at
an
end
who
thinks
anything
more
of
the
name
of
than
of
that
of
as
the
people
told
the
two
factions
at
maidstone
when
they
with
camden
at
their
head
met
to
congratulate
the
regent
on
the
marriage
of
his
daughter
they
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
and
tarred
with
the
same
brush
they
must
be
until
there
be
a
real
reform
of
the
parliament
however
the
people
are
no
longer
deceived
they
are
not
duped
they
that
the
thing
is
that
which
it
is
the
people
of
the
present
day
would
laugh
at
disputes
carried
on
with
so
much
gravity
about
the
of
pratt
and
the
of
yorke
you
are
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
said
the
sensible
people
of
maidstone
and
in
those
words
they
expressed
the
opinion
of
the
whole
country
and
excepted
the
country
from
frant
to
lamberhurst
is
very
woody
i
should
think
woods
and
three
grass
the
corn
what
there
is
of
it
is
about
the
same
as
farther
back
i
saw
a
just
before
i
got
to
lamberhurst
which
will
have
about
two
or
three
hundredweight
to
the
acre
this
lamberhurst
is
a
very
pretty
place
it
lies
in
a
valley
with
beautiful
hills
round
it
the
pastures
about
here
are
very
fine
and
the
roads
are
as
smooth
and
as
handsome
as
those
in
windsor
park
from
the
place
i
had
three
miles
to
come
to
goudhurst
the
tower
of
the
church
of
which
is
pretty
lofty
of
itself
and
the
church
stands
upon
the
very
summit
of
one
of
the
steepest
and
highest
hills
in
this
part
of
the
country
the
has
a
view
of
about
miles
in
diameter
and
the
whole
is
over
a
very
fine
country
though
the
character
of
the
country
differs
little
from
that
which
i
have
before
described
before
i
got
to
goudhurst
i
passed
by
the
side
of
a
village
called
horsenden
and
saw
some
very
large
away
to
my
right
i
should
suppose
there
were
fifty
acres
and
they
appeared
to
me
to
look
pretty
well
i
found
that
they
belonged
to
a
springate
and
people
say
that
it
will
grow
half
as
many
hops
as
he
grew
last
year
while
people
in
general
will
not
grow
a
tenth
part
so
many
this
hop
growing
and
dealing
have
always
been
a
and
this
puts
me
in
mind
of
the
horrible
treatment
which
waddington
received
on
account
of
what
was
called
his
in
hops
it
is
useless
to
talk
as
long
as
that
gentleman
remains
uncompensated
for
his
sufferings
there
can
be
no
hope
of
better
days
ellenborough
was
his
counsel
he
afterwards
became
judge
but
nothing
was
ever
done
to
undo
what
kenyon
had
done
however
waddington
will
i
trust
yet
live
to
obtain
justice
he
has
in
the
meanwhile
given
the
thing
a
blow
and
he
has
the
satisfaction
to
see
it
reel
about
like
a
drunken
man
i
got
to
goudhurst
to
breakfast
and
as
i
heard
that
the
dean
of
rochester
was
to
preach
a
sermon
in
behalf
of
the
i
stopped
to
hear
him
in
waiting
for
his
reverence
i
went
to
the
methodist
where
i
found
the
sunday
school
boys
and
girls
assembled
to
the
almost
filling
of
the
place
which
was
about
thirty
feet
long
and
eighteen
wide
the
minister
was
not
come
and
the
schoolmaster
was
reading
to
the
children
out
of
a
and
shaking
the
brimstone
bag
at
them
most
furiously
this
schoolmaster
was
a
young
fellow
his
skin
perfectly
tight
well
fed
warrant
him
and
he
has
discovered
the
way
of
living
without
work
on
the
labour
of
those
that
do
work
there
were
little
fellows
in
and
about
as
many
girls
listening
to
him
and
i
dare
say
he
eats
as
much
meat
as
any
ten
of
them
by
this
time
the
i
thought
would
be
coming
on
and
therefore
to
the
church
i
went
but
to
my
great
disappointment
i
found
that
the
parson
was
operating
to
the
appearance
of
the
dean
who
was
to
come
on
in
the
afternoon
when
i
agreeably
to
my
plan
must
be
off
the
sermon
was
from
chronicles
ch
and
the
words
of
this
text
described
king
hezekiah
as
a
most
doing
whatever
he
did
all
his
i
write
from
mind
and
therefore
i
do
not
pretend
to
quote
exact
words
and
i
may
be
a
little
in
error
perhaps
as
to
chapter
or
verse
the
object
of
the
preacher
was
to
hold
up
to
his
hearers
the
example
of
hezekiah
and
particularly
in
the
case
of
the
school
affair
he
called
upon
them
to
subscribe
with
all
their
hearts
but
alas
how
little
of
was
there
in
what
he
said
no
effort
to
make
them
see
use
of
the
no
inducement
to
exist
no
argument
in
short
nor
anything
to
move
no
appeal
either
to
the
or
to
the
all
was
general
cold
observation
and
that
too
in
language
which
the
far
greater
part
of
the
hearers
could
not
understand
this
church
is
about
feet
long
and
feet
wide
in
the
clear
it
would
hold
thousand
and
it
had
in
it
besides
sunday
school
or
national
school
boys
and
these
sat
together
in
a
sort
of
lodge
up
in
a
corner
feet
long
and
feet
wide
now
will
any
parson
malthus
or
anybody
else
have
the
impudence
to
tell
me
that
this
church
was
built
for
the
use
of
a
population
not
more
numerous
than
the
present
to
be
sure
when
this
church
was
built
there
could
be
no
idea
of
a
methodist
meeting
coming
to
the
church
and
as
little
i
dare
say
was
it
expected
that
the
preachers
in
the
church
would
ever
call
upon
the
faithful
to
subscribe
money
to
be
sent
up
to
one
joshua
watson
living
in
a
wen
to
be
by
him
laid
out
in
promoting
christian
knowledge
but
at
any
rate
the
methodists
can
not
take
away
above
four
or
five
hundred
and
what
then
was
this
great
church
built
if
there
were
no
more
people
in
those
days
at
goudhurst
than
there
are
now
it
is
very
true
that
the
people
have
in
a
great
measure
ceased
to
go
to
church
there
were
scarcely
any
of
that
class
at
this
great
country
church
i
do
not
believe
there
were
i
can
remember
when
they
were
so
numerous
that
the
parson
could
not
attempt
to
begin
till
the
rattling
of
their
nailed
shoes
ceased
i
have
seen
i
am
sure
five
hundred
boys
and
men
in
coming
out
of
church
at
one
time
has
been
a
fine
day
there
would
have
been
many
at
church
if
ever
there
are
and
here
i
have
another
to
add
to
the
many
things
that
convince
me
that
the
labouring
classes
have
in
great
part
ceased
to
go
to
church
that
their
way
of
thinking
and
feeling
with
regard
to
both
church
and
clergy
are
totally
changed
and
that
there
is
now
very
little
which
the
latter
possess
this
preaching
for
money
to
support
the
schools
is
a
most
curious
affair
altogether
the
king
sends
a
to
the
bishops
as
i
understand
it
to
cause
subscriptions
for
the
schools
and
the
bishops
if
i
am
rightly
told
tell
the
parish
clergy
to
send
the
money
when
collected
to
joshua
watson
the
treasurer
of
a
society
in
the
wen
for
promoting
christian
knowledge
what
the
church
and
all
its
clergy
put
into
motion
to
get
money
from
the
people
to
send
up
to
one
joshua
watson
a
or
late
a
in
mincing
lane
fenchurch
street
london
in
order
that
the
said
may
apply
the
money
to
the
promoting
of
christian
knowledge
what
all
the
deacons
priests
curates
perpetual
vicars
rectors
prebends
doctors
deans
archdeacons
and
fathers
in
god
right
reverend
and
most
reverend
all
yea
all
engaged
in
getting
money
together
to
send
to
a
that
he
may
lay
it
out
in
the
promoting
of
christian
knowledge
their
own
oh
brave
what
a
prince
of
godliness
must
this
be
i
say
or
late
of
mincing
lane
fenchurch
street
london
and
for
sake
some
good
parson
do
send
me
up
a
copy
of
the
king
circular
and
also
of
the
bishop
order
to
send
the
money
to
joshua
watson
for
some
precious
sport
we
will
have
with
joshua
and
his
society
before
we
have
done
with
them
after
service
i
mounted
my
horse
and
jogged
on
through
milkhouse
street
to
benenden
where
i
passed
through
the
estate
and
in
sight
of
the
house
of
hodges
he
keeps
it
very
neat
and
has
planted
a
good
deal
his
do
very
well
but
the
do
not
as
it
seems
to
me
he
ought
to
have
the
american
chestnut
if
he
have
any
if
i
could
discover
everlasting
and
one
too
that
would
grow
faster
even
than
the
ash
would
not
these
kentish
put
me
in
the
kalendar
along
with
their
famous
saint
thomas
of
canterbury
we
shall
see
this
one
of
these
days
coming
through
the
village
of
benenden
i
heard
a
man
at
my
right
talking
very
loud
about
houses
houses
it
was
a
methodist
parson
in
a
house
close
by
the
roadside
i
pulled
up
and
stood
still
in
the
middle
of
the
road
but
looking
in
silent
soberness
into
the
window
which
was
open
of
the
room
in
which
the
preacher
was
at
work
i
believe
my
stopping
rather
disconcerted
him
for
he
got
into
shocking
do
you
said
he
laying
great
stress
on
the
word
do
you
that
you
have
ready
for
you
houses
houses
i
say
i
say
do
you
know
do
you
know
that
you
have
houses
in
the
heavens
not
made
with
hands
do
you
know
this
from
has
the
blessed
jesus
you
and
on
he
went
to
say
that
if
jesus
had
told
them
so
they
would
be
saved
and
that
if
he
had
not
and
did
not
they
would
be
damned
some
girls
whom
i
saw
in
the
room
plump
and
rosy
as
could
be
did
not
seem
at
all
daunted
by
these
menaces
and
indeed
they
appeared
to
me
to
be
thinking
much
more
about
getting
houses
for
themselves
this
world
just
to
a
before
they
entered
or
endeavoured
to
enter
or
even
thought
much
about
those
of
which
the
parson
was
speaking
with
and
little
snug
gardens
attached
to
them
together
with
all
the
other
domestic
and
conjugal
circumstances
these
girls
seemed
to
me
to
be
preparing
themselves
for
the
truth
is
these
fellows
have
no
power
on
the
minds
of
any
but
the
miserable
scarcely
had
i
proceeded
a
hundred
yards
from
the
place
where
this
fellow
was
bawling
when
i
came
to
the
very
situation
which
he
ought
to
have
occupied
i
mean
the
which
the
people
of
benenden
have
with
singular
humanity
fitted
up
with
a
so
that
the
patient
while
he
is
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
remedy
is
not
exposed
to
the
danger
of
catching
cold
by
sitting
as
in
other
places
upon
the
ground
always
damp
and
sometimes
actually
wet
but
i
would
ask
the
people
of
benenden
what
is
the
of
this
humane
precaution
and
indeed
what
is
the
use
of
the
stocks
themselves
if
while
a
fellow
is
ranting
and
bawling
in
the
manner
just
described
at
the
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
from
the
stocks
the
stocks
as
is
here
actually
the
case
are
almost
hidden
by
grass
and
nettles
this
however
is
the
case
all
over
the
country
not
nettles
and
grass
indeed
smothering
the
stocks
but
i
never
see
any
feet
peeping
through
the
holes
anywhere
though
i
find
methodist
parsons
everywhere
and
though
law
compels
the
parishes
to
keep
all
the
pairs
of
stocks
that
exist
in
all
parts
of
them
and
in
some
parishes
they
have
to
keep
up
several
pairs
i
am
aware
that
a
good
part
of
the
use
of
the
stocks
is
the
they
ought
to
produce
i
am
not
supposing
that
they
are
of
no
use
because
not
continually
furnished
with
legs
but
there
is
a
wide
difference
between
and
and
it
is
clear
that
a
fellow
who
has
had
the
stocks
under
his
eye
all
his
lifetime
and
has
seen
a
pair
of
feet
peeping
through
them
will
stand
no
more
in
awe
of
the
stocks
than
rooks
do
of
an
old
shoyhoy
or
than
the
ministers
or
their
agents
do
of
hobhouse
and
burdett
stocks
that
never
pinch
a
pair
of
ankles
are
like
ministerial
responsibility
a
thing
to
talk
about
but
for
no
other
use
a
mere
mockery
a
thing
laughed
at
by
those
whom
it
is
intended
to
keep
in
check
it
is
time
that
the
stocks
were
again
or
that
the
expense
of
keeping
them
up
were
put
an
end
to
this
mild
this
gentle
this
sort
of
correction
is
for
our
present
rulers
but
mark
the
consequence
gaols
ten
times
as
big
as
formerly
houses
of
correction
the
hulks
and
the
country
filled
with
of
one
sort
and
another
or
other
spies
and
if
a
hare
or
pheasant
come
to
an
untimely
death
from
the
wen
are
not
unfrequently
called
down
to
find
out
and
secure
the
bloody
offender
englishmen
mark
how
we
take
to
those
things
which
we
formerly
ridiculed
in
the
french
and
take
them
up
too
just
as
that
brave
and
spirited
people
have
shaken
them
off
i
saw
not
long
ago
an
account
of
a
wen
being
sent
into
the
country
where
he
assumed
joined
some
poachers
as
they
are
called
got
into
their
secrets
went
out
in
the
night
with
them
and
then
having
laid
his
plans
with
the
assisted
to
take
them
and
convict
them
what
is
this
is
this
the
land
of
manly
hearts
is
this
the
country
that
laughed
at
the
french
for
their
submissions
what
are
kept
for
this
does
the
law
say
so
however
thank
god
almighty
the
estates
are
passing
away
into
the
hands
of
those
who
have
had
borrowed
from
them
the
money
to
uphold
this
monster
of
a
system
the
debt
the
blessed
debt
will
at
last
restore
to
us
freedom
just
after
i
quitted
benenden
i
saw
some
bunches
of
lying
upon
the
quickset
hedge
of
a
cottage
garden
i
found
upon
inquiry
that
they
were
bunches
of
the
straw
of
grass
seeing
a
face
through
the
window
of
the
cottage
i
called
out
and
asked
what
that
straw
was
for
the
person
within
said
it
was
to
make
with
i
asked
him
it
was
a
young
man
how
he
knew
how
to
do
it
he
said
he
had
got
a
little
book
that
had
been
made
by
cobbett
i
told
him
that
i
was
the
man
and
should
like
to
see
some
of
his
work
and
asked
him
to
bring
it
out
to
me
i
being
afraid
to
tie
my
horse
he
told
me
that
he
was
a
and
that
he
could
not
come
out
at
last
i
went
in
leaving
my
horse
to
be
held
by
a
little
girl
i
found
a
young
man
who
has
been
a
cripple
for
fourteen
years
some
ladies
in
the
neighbourhood
had
got
him
the
book
and
his
family
had
got
him
the
grass
he
had
made
some
very
nice
plat
and
he
had
knitted
the
greater
part
of
the
crown
of
a
bonnet
and
had
done
the
whole
very
nicely
though
as
to
the
knitting
he
had
proceeded
in
a
way
to
make
it
very
tedious
he
was
knitting
upon
a
block
however
these
little
matters
will
soon
be
set
to
rights
there
will
soon
be
persons
to
teach
knitting
in
all
parts
of
the
country
i
left
this
unfortunate
young
man
with
the
pleasing
reflection
that
i
had
in
all
likelihood
been
the
cause
of
his
gaining
a
good
living
by
his
labour
during
the
rest
of
his
life
how
long
will
it
be
before
my
calumniators
the
false
and
infamous
london
press
will
take
the
whole
of
it
together
and
leave
out
its
evil
do
as
much
good
as
my
pen
has
done
in
this
one
instance
how
long
will
it
be
ere
the
ruffians
the
base
hirelings
the
infamous
traders
who
own
and
who
conduct
that
press
how
long
ere
one
of
them
or
all
of
them
together
shall
cause
a
cottage
to
smile
shall
add
one
ounce
to
the
meal
of
the
labouring
man
rolvenden
was
my
next
village
and
thence
i
could
see
the
lofty
church
of
tenterden
on
the
top
of
a
hill
at
three
miles
distance
this
rolvenden
is
a
very
beautiful
village
and
indeed
such
are
all
the
places
along
here
these
villages
are
not
like
those
in
the
counties
as
i
call
them
that
is
the
counties
of
flint
and
chalk
here
the
houses
have
gardens
in
front
of
them
as
well
as
behind
and
there
is
a
good
deal
of
show
and
finery
about
them
and
their
gardens
the
high
roads
are
without
a
stone
in
them
and
everything
looks
like
at
this
place
i
saw
several
in
one
garden
and
much
finer
than
we
see
them
in
general
though
mind
this
is
no
proof
of
a
mild
climate
for
the
arbutus
is
a
native
of
one
much
colder
than
that
of
england
and
indeed
than
that
of
scotland
coming
from
benenden
to
rolvenden
i
saw
some
swedish
turnips
and
strange
as
the
reader
will
think
it
the
first
i
saw
after
leaving
worth
the
reason
i
take
to
be
this
the
farms
are
all
furnished
with
as
in
devonshire
about
honiton
these
give
hay
for
the
sheep
and
cattle
in
winter
or
at
any
rate
they
do
all
that
is
not
done
by
the
white
turnips
it
may
be
a
question
whether
it
would
be
more
to
break
up
and
sow
swedes
but
this
is
the
reason
of
their
not
being
cultivated
along
here
white
turnips
are
more
easily
got
than
swedes
they
may
be
sown
later
and
with
good
hay
they
will
fat
cattle
and
sheep
but
the
swedes
will
do
this
business
without
hay
in
norfolk
and
suffolk
the
land
is
not
generally
of
a
nature
to
make
therefore
the
people
there
resort
to
swedes
this
has
been
a
sad
time
for
these
however
all
along
here
they
have
but
just
finished
haymaking
and
i
see
all
along
my
way
from
east
grinstead
to
this
place
the
colour
of
dirt
and
like
just
before
i
got
to
this
place
tenterden
i
crossed
a
bit
of
marsh
land
which
i
found
upon
inquiry
is
a
sort
of
little
branch
or
spray
running
out
of
that
immense
and
famous
tract
of
country
called
which
i
find
i
have
to
cross
in
order
to
get
to
dover
along
by
the
through
hythe
and
folkestone
this
tenterden
is
a
market
town
and
a
singularly
bright
spot
it
consists
of
one
street
which
is
in
some
places
more
perhaps
than
two
hundred
feet
wide
on
one
side
of
the
street
the
houses
have
gardens
before
them
from
to
feet
deep
the
town
is
upon
a
hill
the
afternoon
was
very
fine
and
just
as
i
rose
the
hill
and
entered
the
street
the
people
had
come
out
of
church
and
were
moving
along
towards
their
houses
it
was
a
very
fine
sight
people
do
not
go
to
i
saw
in
short
drawn
out
before
me
the
dress
and
beauty
of
the
town
and
a
great
many
very
very
pretty
girls
i
saw
and
saw
them
too
in
their
best
attire
i
remember
the
girls
in
the
de
and
really
i
think
those
of
tenterden
resemble
them
i
do
not
know
why
they
should
not
for
there
is
the
de
only
just
over
the
water
just
opposite
this
very
place
the
hops
about
here
are
not
so
very
bad
they
say
that
one
man
near
this
town
will
have
eight
tons
of
hops
upon
ten
acres
of
land
this
is
a
great
crop
any
year
a
very
great
crop
this
man
may
perhaps
sell
his
hops
for
pounds
what
a
concern
it
is
however
such
always
was
and
always
must
be
it
is
a
thing
of
perfect
hazard
the
church
at
this
place
is
a
very
large
and
fine
old
building
the
tower
stands
upon
a
base
thirty
feet
square
like
the
church
at
goudhurst
it
will
hold
three
thousand
people
and
let
it
be
observed
that
when
these
churches
were
built
people
had
not
yet
thought
of
cramming
them
with
as
a
stable
is
filled
with
stalls
those
who
built
these
churches
had
no
idea
that
worshipping
god
meant
going
to
to
hear
a
man
talk
out
what
he
called
preaching
by
they
meant
very
different
things
and
above
all
things
when
they
had
made
a
fine
and
noble
building
they
did
not
dream
of
disfiguring
the
inside
of
it
by
filling
its
floor
with
large
and
deep
boxes
made
of
deal
boards
in
short
the
floor
was
the
place
for
the
worshippers
to
stand
or
to
kneel
and
there
was
no
place
and
no
place
all
were
upon
a
level
at
any
rate
some
were
not
stuck
into
pews
lined
with
green
or
red
cloth
while
others
were
crammed
into
corners
to
stand
erect
or
sit
on
the
floor
these
odious
distinctions
are
of
protestant
origin
and
growth
this
lazy
lolling
in
pews
we
owe
to
what
is
called
the
a
place
filled
with
benches
and
boxes
looks
like
an
eating
or
a
drinking
place
but
certainly
not
like
a
place
of
worship
a
frenchman
who
had
been
driven
from
domingo
to
philadelphia
by
the
wilberforces
of
france
went
to
church
along
with
me
one
sunday
he
had
never
been
in
a
protestant
place
of
before
upon
looking
round
him
and
seeing
everybody
comfortably
seated
while
a
couple
of
good
stoves
were
keeping
the
place
as
warm
as
a
slack
oven
he
exclaimed
on
sert
dieu
bien
à
son
aise
ici
that
is
egad
they
serve
god
very
much
at
their
ease
here
i
always
think
of
this
when
i
see
a
church
full
of
pews
as
indeed
is
now
always
the
case
with
our
churches
those
who
built
these
churches
had
no
idea
of
this
they
made
their
calculations
as
to
the
people
to
be
contained
in
them
not
making
any
allowance
for
i
often
wonder
how
it
is
that
the
present
parsons
are
not
ashamed
to
call
the
churches
they
must
know
the
origin
of
them
and
how
they
can
look
at
them
and
at
the
same
time
revile
the
catholics
is
astonishing
to
me
this
evening
i
have
been
to
the
methodist
i
was
attracted
fairly
drawn
all
down
the
street
by
the
when
i
came
to
the
place
the
parson
was
got
into
prayer
his
hands
were
clenched
together
and
held
up
his
face
turned
up
and
back
so
as
to
be
nearly
parallel
with
the
ceiling
and
he
was
bawling
away
with
his
do
thou
and
mayest
thou
and
may
we
enough
to
stun
one
noisy
however
as
he
was
he
was
unable
to
fix
the
attention
of
a
parcel
of
girls
in
the
gallery
whose
eyes
were
all
over
the
place
while
his
eyes
were
so
devoutly
shut
up
after
a
deal
of
this
rigmarole
called
prayer
came
the
as
the
negroes
call
it
and
a
it
really
was
such
a
mixture
of
whining
cant
and
of
foppish
affectation
i
scarcely
ever
heard
in
my
life
the
text
was
i
speak
from
memory
one
of
saint
peter
epistles
if
he
have
more
than
one
the
chapter
and
verse
the
words
were
to
this
amount
that
the
righteous
would
be
saved
with
difficulty
what
must
become
of
the
ungodly
and
the
after
as
neat
a
dish
of
nonsense
and
of
impertinences
as
one
could
wish
to
have
served
up
came
the
distinction
between
the
and
the
the
sinner
was
one
who
did
moral
wrong
the
ungodly
one
who
did
no
moral
wrong
but
who
was
not
regenerated
he
positively
told
us
were
to
be
damned
one
was
just
as
bad
as
the
other
moral
rectitude
was
to
do
nothing
in
saving
the
man
he
was
to
be
damned
unless
born
again
and
how
was
he
to
be
born
again
unless
he
came
to
the
and
gave
the
fellows
money
he
distinctly
told
us
that
a
man
perfectly
moral
might
be
damned
and
that
the
vilest
of
the
vile
and
the
basest
of
the
base
i
quote
his
very
words
would
be
saved
if
they
became
regenerate
and
that
colliers
whose
souls
had
been
as
black
as
their
coals
had
by
regeneration
become
bright
as
the
saints
that
sing
before
god
and
the
lamb
and
will
the
again
find
fault
with
me
for
cutting
at
this
bawling
canting
crew
monstrous
it
is
to
think
that
the
clergy
of
the
church
really
encourage
these
roving
fanatics
the
church
seems
aware
of
its
loss
of
credit
and
of
power
it
seems
willing
to
lean
even
upon
these
men
who
be
it
observed
seem
on
their
part
to
have
taken
the
church
under
their
protection
they
always
pray
for
the
i
mean
the
ministry
at
they
are
most
loyal
souls
the
thing
and
they
lend
their
aid
upholding
thing
what
silly
nay
what
base
creatures
those
must
be
who
really
give
their
money
give
their
pennies
which
ought
to
buy
bread
for
their
own
children
who
thus
give
their
money
to
these
lazy
and
impudent
fellows
who
call
themselves
ministers
of
god
who
prowl
about
the
country
living
easy
and
jovial
lives
upon
the
fruit
of
the
labour
of
other
people
however
it
is
in
some
measure
these
people
fault
if
they
did
not
give
the
others
could
not
receive
i
wish
to
see
every
labouring
man
well
fed
and
well
clad
but
really
the
man
who
gives
any
portion
of
his
earnings
to
these
fellows
deserves
to
want
he
deserves
to
be
pinched
with
hunger
misery
is
the
just
reward
of
this
worst
species
of
prodigality
the
makes
a
great
part
of
what
passes
in
these
a
number
of
women
and
girls
singing
together
make
very
sweet
sounds
few
men
there
are
who
have
not
felt
of
sounds
of
this
sort
men
are
sometimes
pretty
nearly
bewitched
without
knowing
how
do
a
good
deal
but
do
more
we
may
talk
of
sparkling
eyes
and
snowy
bosoms
as
long
as
we
please
but
what
are
these
with
a
croaking
masculine
voice
the
parson
seemed
to
be
fully
aware
of
the
importance
of
this
part
of
the
service
the
subject
of
his
hymn
was
something
about
christian
love
love
of
jesus
but
still
it
was
about
and
the
parson
read
or
gave
out
the
verses
in
a
singularly
and
voice
with
his
head
on
one
side
and
giving
it
rather
a
swing
i
am
satisfied
that
the
singing
forms
great
part
of
the
young
girls
like
to
sing
and
young
men
like
to
hear
them
nay
old
ones
too
and
as
i
have
just
said
it
was
the
singing
that
me
three
hundred
yards
down
the
street
at
tenterden
to
enter
this
i
wrote
some
hymns
myself
and
published
them
in
i
will
give
any
methodist
parson
leave
to
put
them
into
his
kent
monday
noon
i
have
had
a
fine
ride
and
i
suppose
the
quakers
have
had
a
fine
time
of
it
at
mark
lane
from
tenterden
i
set
off
at
five
and
got
to
appledore
after
a
most
delightful
ride
the
high
land
upon
my
right
and
the
low
land
on
my
left
the
fog
was
so
thick
and
white
along
some
of
the
low
land
that
i
should
have
taken
it
for
water
if
little
hills
and
trees
had
not
risen
up
through
it
here
and
there
indeed
the
view
was
very
much
like
those
which
are
presented
in
the
deep
valleys
near
the
great
rivers
in
new
brunswick
north
america
at
the
time
when
the
snows
melt
in
the
spring
and
when
in
sailing
over
those
valleys
you
look
down
from
the
side
of
your
canoe
and
see
the
lofty
woods
beneath
you
i
once
went
in
a
across
a
of
this
description
the
canoe
being
paddled
by
two
yankees
we
started
in
a
stream
the
stream
became
a
wide
water
and
that
water
got
deeper
and
deeper
as
i
could
see
by
the
trees
all
was
woods
till
we
got
to
sail
amongst
the
branches
of
the
we
got
into
a
large
open
space
a
piece
of
water
a
mile
or
two
or
three
or
four
wide
with
woods
under
a
fog
with
the
tops
of
trees
rising
through
it
is
very
much
like
this
and
such
was
the
fog
that
i
saw
this
morning
in
my
ride
to
appledore
the
church
at
appledore
is
very
large
big
enough
to
hold
people
and
the
place
does
not
seem
to
contain
half
a
thousand
old
enough
to
go
to
church
in
coming
along
i
saw
a
making
though
i
hardly
think
the
wheat
can
be
dry
under
the
bands
the
corn
is
all
good
here
and
i
am
told
they
give
twelve
shillings
an
acre
for
reaping
wheat
in
quitting
this
appledore
i
crossed
a
canal
and
entered
on
romney
marsh
this
was
on
both
sides
of
me
to
a
great
distance
the
flocks
and
herds
immense
the
sheep
are
of
a
breed
that
takes
its
name
from
the
marsh
they
are
called
romney
marsh
sheep
very
pretty
and
large
the
wethers
when
fat
weigh
about
twelve
stone
or
one
hundred
pounds
the
faces
of
these
sheep
are
white
and
indeed
the
whole
sheep
is
as
white
as
a
piece
of
the
wool
does
not
look
dirty
and
oily
like
that
of
other
sheep
the
cattle
appear
to
be
all
of
the
breed
red
and
they
say
a
great
deal
better
than
the
devonshire
how
curious
is
the
of
a
country
the
of
sussex
those
miserable
tracts
of
heath
and
fern
and
bushes
and
sand
called
ashdown
forest
and
saint
leonard
forest
to
which
latter
lord
erskine
estate
belongs
these
wretched
tracts
and
the
not
much
less
wretched
farms
in
their
neighbourhood
the
which
we
see
in
romney
marsh
they
are
calved
in
the
spring
they
are
weaned
in
a
little
bit
of
they
are
then
put
into
stubbles
and
about
in
the
fallows
for
the
first
summer
they
are
brought
into
the
yard
to
winter
on
rough
hay
or
the
next
two
summers
they
spend
in
the
rough
woods
or
in
the
forest
the
two
winters
they
live
on
straw
they
then
pass
another
summer
on
the
forest
or
at
and
then
they
come
here
or
go
elsewhere
to
be
fatted
with
cattle
of
this
kind
and
with
sheep
such
as
i
have
spoken
of
before
this
marsh
abounds
in
every
part
of
it
and
the
sight
is
most
beautiful
at
three
miles
from
appledore
i
came
through
snargate
a
village
with
five
houses
and
with
a
church
capable
of
containing
two
thousand
people
the
vagabonds
tell
us
however
that
we
have
a
wonderful
increase
of
population
these
vagabonds
will
be
hanged
or
else
justice
will
have
fled
from
the
face
of
the
earth
at
brenzett
a
mile
further
on
i
with
great
difficulty
got
a
rasher
of
bacon
for
breakfast
the
few
houses
that
there
are
are
miserable
in
the
extreme
the
church
here
only
a
from
the
last
nearly
as
large
and
nobody
to
go
to
it
what
will
the
attempt
to
make
us
believe
that
these
churches
were
for
indeed
those
must
have
been
if
these
churches
were
erected
without
there
being
any
more
people
than
there
are
now
but
built
them
where
did
the
where
did
the
hands
come
from
this
place
presents
another
proof
of
the
truth
of
my
old
observation
and
from
the
window
of
the
house
in
which
i
could
scarcely
get
a
rasher
of
bacon
and
not
an
egg
i
saw
numberless
flocks
and
herds
fatting
and
the
fields
loaded
with
corn
the
next
village
which
was
two
miles
further
on
was
old
romney
and
along
here
i
had
for
great
part
of
the
way
on
one
side
of
me
and
on
the
other
i
asked
what
the
amount
of
the
crop
of
wheat
would
be
they
told
me
better
than
five
quarters
to
the
acre
i
thought
so
myself
i
have
a
sample
of
the
red
wheat
and
another
of
the
white
they
are
both
very
fine
they
reap
the
wheat
here
nearly
two
feet
from
the
ground
and
even
then
they
cut
it
three
feet
long
i
never
saw
corn
like
this
before
it
very
far
exceeds
the
corn
under
portsdown
hill
that
at
gosport
and
tichfield
they
have
here
about
eight
hundred
large
very
large
sheaves
to
an
acre
i
wonder
how
long
it
will
be
after
the
end
of
the
world
before
birbeck
will
see
the
american
prairies
half
so
good
as
this
marsh
in
a
garden
here
i
saw
some
very
fine
onions
and
a
prodigious
crop
sure
sign
of
most
excellent
land
at
this
old
romney
there
is
a
church
two
miles
only
from
the
last
mind
fit
to
contain
one
thousand
five
hundred
people
and
there
are
for
the
people
of
the
parish
to
live
in
or
houses
and
yet
the
have
the
impudence
to
tell
us
that
the
population
of
england
has
vastly
increased
curious
system
that
depopulates
romney
marsh
and
peoples
bagshot
heath
it
is
an
unnatural
system
it
is
the
system
it
is
a
system
that
must
be
destroyed
or
that
will
destroy
the
country
the
rotten
borough
of
new
romney
came
next
in
my
way
and
here
to
my
great
surprise
i
found
myself
upon
the
for
i
had
not
looked
at
a
map
of
kent
for
years
and
perhaps
never
i
had
got
a
list
of
places
from
a
friend
in
sussex
whom
i
asked
to
give
me
a
route
to
dover
and
to
send
me
through
those
parts
of
kent
which
he
thought
would
be
most
interesting
to
me
never
was
i
so
much
surprised
as
when
i
saw
this
place
now
that
the
of
the
thing
are
over
is
they
say
become
miserably
poor
from
new
romney
to
dimchurch
is
about
four
miles
all
along
i
had
the
on
my
right
and
on
my
left
sometimes
and
sometimes
they
told
me
here
and
also
further
back
in
the
marsh
that
they
were
to
have
an
acre
for
reaping
wheat
from
dimchurch
to
hythe
you
go
on
the
and
nearly
the
same
from
hythe
to
sandgate
from
which
last
place
you
come
over
the
hill
to
folkestone
but
let
me
look
back
here
has
been
the
squandering
here
has
been
the
work
here
we
see
some
of
these
causes
that
are
now
sending
some
farmers
to
the
workhouse
and
driving
others
to
flee
the
country
or
to
cut
their
throats
i
had
baited
my
horse
at
new
romney
and
was
coming
jogging
along
very
soberly
now
looking
at
the
sea
then
looking
at
the
cattle
then
the
corn
when
my
eye
in
swinging
round
lighted
upon
a
great
round
building
standing
upon
the
beach
i
had
scarcely
had
time
to
think
about
what
it
could
be
when
twenty
or
thirty
others
standing
along
the
coast
caught
my
eye
and
if
any
one
had
been
behind
me
he
might
have
heard
me
exclaim
in
a
voice
that
made
my
horse
bound
the
by
oh
lord
to
think
that
i
should
be
destined
to
behold
these
monuments
of
the
wisdom
of
pitt
and
dundas
and
perceval
good
god
here
they
are
piles
of
bricks
in
a
circular
form
about
three
hundred
feet
circumference
at
the
base
about
forty
feet
high
and
about
one
hundred
and
fifty
feet
circumference
at
the
top
there
is
a
about
midway
up
in
each
and
each
has
two
windows
cannons
were
to
be
fired
from
the
top
of
these
things
in
order
to
defend
the
country
against
the
french
jacobins
i
think
i
have
counted
along
here
upwards
of
thirty
of
these
ridiculous
things
which
i
dare
say
cost
five
perhaps
ten
thousand
pounds
each
and
one
of
which
was
i
am
told
on
the
coast
of
sussex
the
other
day
for
two
hundred
pounds
there
is
they
say
a
chain
of
these
things
all
the
way
to
hastings
i
dare
say
they
cost
millions
but
far
indeed
are
these
from
being
all
or
half
or
a
quarter
of
the
squanderings
along
here
hythe
is
half
the
hills
are
covered
with
barracks
and
barracks
most
expensive
most
squandering
fill
up
the
side
of
the
hill
here
is
a
canal
i
crossed
it
at
appledore
made
for
the
length
of
thirty
miles
from
hythe
in
kent
to
rye
in
sussex
to
out
the
for
those
armies
who
had
so
often
crossed
the
rhine
and
the
danube
were
to
be
kept
back
by
a
canal
made
by
pitt
thirty
feet
wide
at
the
most
all
along
the
coast
there
are
works
of
some
sort
or
other
incessant
sinks
of
money
walls
of
immense
dimensions
masses
of
stone
brought
and
put
into
piles
then
you
see
some
of
the
walls
and
buildings
falling
down
some
that
have
never
been
finished
the
whole
thing
all
taken
together
looks
as
if
a
spell
had
been
all
of
a
sudden
set
upon
the
workmen
or
in
the
words
of
the
scripture
here
is
the
of
abomination
standing
in
high
however
all
is
right
these
things
were
made
with
the
hearty
good
will
of
those
who
are
now
coming
to
ruin
in
consequence
of
the
debt
contracted
for
the
purpose
of
making
these
things
this
is
all
the
load
will
come
at
last
upon
the
right
shoulders
between
hythe
and
sandgate
a
village
at
about
two
miles
from
hythe
i
first
saw
the
french
coast
the
chalk
cliffs
at
calais
are
as
plain
to
the
view
as
possible
and
also
the
land
which
they
tell
me
is
near
boulogne
folkestone
lies
under
a
hill
here
as
reigate
does
in
surrey
only
here
the
sea
is
open
to
your
right
as
you
come
along
the
corn
is
very
early
here
and
very
fine
all
cut
even
the
beans
and
they
will
be
ready
to
cart
in
a
day
or
two
folkestone
is
now
a
little
place
probably
a
quarter
part
as
big
as
it
was
formerly
here
is
a
church
one
hundred
and
twenty
feet
long
and
fifty
feet
wide
it
is
a
sort
of
little
cathedral
the
has
evidently
been
three
times
as
large
as
it
is
now
before
i
got
into
folkestone
i
saw
no
less
than
men
women
and
boys
and
girls
gleaning
or
leasing
in
a
field
of
about
ten
acres
the
people
all
along
here
complain
most
bitterly
of
the
of
the
truth
is
that
the
squandered
millions
are
gone
the
nation
has
now
to
suffer
for
this
squandering
the
money
served
to
silence
some
to
make
others
bawl
to
cause
the
good
to
be
oppressed
to
cause
the
bad
to
be
exalted
to
crush
the
jacobins
and
what
is
the
what
is
the
the
is
not
yet
come
but
as
to
the
result
thus
far
go
ask
the
families
of
those
farmers
who
after
having
for
so
many
years
threatened
to
shoot
jacobins
have
in
instances
not
a
few
shot
themselves
go
ask
the
ghosts
of
pitt
and
of
castlereagh
what
has
thus
far
been
the
go
ask
the
hampshire
farmer
who
not
many
months
since
actually
blowed
out
his
own
brains
with
one
of
those
very
pistols
which
he
had
long
carried
in
his
yeomanry
cavalry
holsters
to
be
ready
to
keep
down
the
jacobins
and
radicals
oh
god
inscrutable
are
thy
ways
but
thou
art
just
and
of
thy
justice
what
a
complete
proof
have
we
in
the
case
of
these
very
martello
towers
they
were
erected
to
keep
out
the
jacobin
french
lest
they
should
come
and
assist
the
jacobin
english
the
people
of
this
coast
were
fattened
by
the
building
of
them
pitt
and
his
loyal
waged
interminable
war
against
jacobins
these
very
towers
are
now
used
to
keep
these
cinque
ports
themselves
in
order
these
towers
are
now
used
to
lodge
men
whose
business
it
is
to
sally
forth
not
upon
jacobins
but
upon
thus
after
having
sucked
up
millions
of
the
nation
money
these
loyal
cinque
ports
are
squeezed
again
kept
in
order
kept
down
by
the
very
towers
which
they
rejoiced
to
see
rise
to
keep
down
the
jacobins
monday
i
got
here
this
evening
about
six
having
come
miles
but
i
must
defer
my
remarks
on
the
country
between
folkestone
and
this
place
a
most
interesting
spot
and
well
worthy
of
particular
attention
what
place
i
shall
date
from
after
dover
i
am
by
no
means
certain
but
be
it
from
what
place
it
may
the
continuation
of
my
journal
shall
be
published
in
due
course
if
the
atlantic
ocean
could
not
cut
off
the
communication
between
me
and
my
readers
a
mere
strip
of
water
not
much
wider
than
an
american
river
will
hardly
do
it
i
am
in
real
truth
undecided
as
yet
whether
i
shall
go
on
to
france
or
back
to
the
i
think
i
shall
when
i
go
out
of
this
inn
toss
the
bridle
upon
my
horse
neck
and
let
him
decide
for
me
i
am
sure
he
is
more
fit
to
decide
on
such
a
point
than
our
ministers
are
to
decide
on
any
point
connected
with
the
happiness
greatness
and
honour
of
this
kingdom
rural
ride
from
dover
through
the
isle
of
thanet
by
canterbury
and
faversham
across
to
maidstone
up
to
tonbridge
through
the
weald
of
kent
and
over
the
hills
by
westerham
and
hays
to
the
wen
wednesday
evening
on
monday
i
was
balancing
in
my
own
mind
whether
i
should
go
to
france
or
not
i
have
decided
the
question
in
the
negative
and
shall
set
off
this
evening
for
the
isle
of
thanet
that
spot
so
famous
for
corn
i
broke
off
without
giving
an
account
of
the
country
between
folkestone
and
dover
which
is
a
very
interesting
one
in
itself
and
was
peculiarly
interesting
to
me
on
many
accounts
i
have
often
mentioned
in
describing
the
parts
of
the
country
over
which
i
have
travelled
i
have
often
mentioned
the
and
also
the
which
i
had
traced
running
parallel
with
each
other
from
about
farnham
in
surrey
to
sevenoaks
in
kent
the
reader
must
remember
how
particular
i
have
been
to
observe
that
in
going
up
from
chilworth
and
albury
through
dorking
reigate
godstone
and
so
on
the
two
chains
or
ridges
approach
so
near
to
each
other
that
in
many
places
you
actually
have
a
to
your
right
and
a
to
your
left
at
not
more
than
forty
yards
from
each
other
in
some
places
these
chains
of
hills
run
off
from
each
other
to
a
great
distance
even
to
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
they
then
approach
again
towards
each
other
and
so
they
go
on
i
was
always
desirous
to
ascertain
whether
these
chains
or
ridges
continued
on
thus
the
i
have
now
found
that
they
do
and
if
you
go
out
into
the
channel
at
folkestone
there
you
see
a
and
a
folkestone
stands
upon
the
sand
in
a
little
dell
about
seven
hundred
or
eight
hundred
yards
from
the
very
termination
of
the
ridge
all
the
way
along
the
is
the
most
lofty
until
you
come
to
leith
hill
and
hindhead
and
here
at
folkestone
the
tapers
off
in
a
sort
of
flat
towards
the
sea
the
land
is
like
what
it
is
at
reigate
a
very
steep
hill
a
hill
of
full
a
mile
high
and
bending
exactly
in
the
same
manner
as
the
hill
at
reigate
does
the
winds
up
it
and
goes
over
it
in
exactly
the
same
manner
as
that
at
reigate
the
land
to
the
south
of
the
hill
begins
a
poor
thin
white
loam
upon
the
chalk
soon
gets
to
be
a
very
fine
rich
loam
upon
the
chalk
goes
on
till
it
mingles
the
chalky
loam
with
the
sandy
loam
and
thus
it
goes
on
down
to
the
or
to
the
edge
of
the
cliff
it
is
a
beautiful
bed
of
earth
here
resembling
in
extent
that
on
the
south
side
of
portsdown
hill
rather
than
that
of
reigate
the
crops
here
are
always
good
if
they
are
good
anywhere
a
large
part
of
this
fine
tract
of
land
as
well
as
the
little
town
of
sandgate
which
is
a
beautiful
little
place
upon
the
beach
itself
and
also
great
part
of
the
town
of
folkestone
belong
they
tell
me
to
lord
radnor
who
takes
his
title
of
viscount
from
folkestone
upon
the
hill
begins
and
continues
on
for
some
miles
that
stiff
red
loam
approaching
to
a
clay
which
i
have
several
times
described
as
forming
the
soil
at
the
top
of
this
i
spoke
of
it
in
the
register
of
the
of
august
last
page
and
i
then
said
that
it
was
like
the
land
on
the
top
of
this
very
ridge
at
ashmansworth
in
the
north
of
hampshire
at
reigate
you
find
precisely
the
same
soil
upon
the
top
of
the
hill
a
very
red
clayey
sort
of
loam
with
big
yellow
flint
stones
in
it
everywhere
the
soil
is
the
same
upon
the
top
of
the
high
part
of
this
ridge
i
have
now
found
it
to
be
the
same
on
the
edge
of
the
sea
that
i
found
it
on
the
corner
of
hampshire
from
the
hill
you
keep
descending
all
the
way
to
dover
a
distance
of
about
six
miles
and
it
is
absolutely
six
miles
of
down
hill
on
your
right
you
have
the
lofty
land
which
forms
a
series
of
chalk
cliffs
from
the
top
of
which
you
look
into
the
sea
on
your
left
you
have
ground
that
goes
rising
up
from
you
in
the
same
sort
of
way
the
goes
down
the
middle
of
a
valley
each
side
of
which
as
far
as
you
can
see
may
be
about
a
mile
and
a
half
it
is
six
miles
long
you
will
remember
and
here
therefore
with
very
little
interruption
very
few
chasms
there
are
square
miles
of
it
is
a
patch
such
as
you
very
seldom
see
and
especially
of
corn
so
good
as
it
is
here
i
should
think
that
the
wheat
all
along
here
would
average
pretty
nearly
four
quarters
to
the
acre
a
few
oats
are
sown
a
great
deal
of
barley
and
that
a
very
fine
crop
the
town
of
dover
is
like
other
towns
but
really
much
more
clean
and
with
less
blackguard
people
in
it
than
i
ever
observed
in
any
before
it
is
a
most
picturesque
place
to
be
sure
on
one
side
of
it
rises
upon
the
top
of
a
very
steep
hill
the
old
castle
with
all
its
fortifications
on
the
other
side
of
it
there
is
another
the
side
of
which
is
pretty
nearly
perpendicular
and
rises
up
from
sixty
to
a
hundred
feet
higher
than
the
tops
of
the
houses
which
stand
pretty
nearly
close
to
the
foot
of
the
hill
i
got
into
dover
rather
late
it
was
dusk
when
i
was
going
down
the
street
towards
the
quay
i
happened
to
look
up
and
was
quite
astonished
to
perceive
cows
grazing
upon
a
spot
apparently
fifty
feet
above
the
tops
of
the
houses
and
measuring
horizontally
not
perhaps
more
than
ten
or
twenty
feet
from
a
line
which
would
have
formed
a
continuation
into
the
air
i
went
up
to
the
same
spot
the
next
day
myself
and
you
actually
look
down
upon
the
houses
as
you
look
out
of
a
window
upon
people
in
the
street
the
valley
that
runs
down
from
folkestone
is
when
it
gets
to
dover
crossed
by
another
valley
that
runs
down
from
canterbury
or
at
least
from
the
canterbury
direction
it
is
in
the
gorge
of
this
cross
valley
that
dover
is
built
the
two
jut
out
into
the
sea
and
the
water
that
comes
up
between
them
forms
a
harbour
for
this
ancient
most
interesting
and
beautiful
place
on
the
hill
to
the
north
stands
the
castle
of
dover
which
is
fortified
in
the
ancient
manner
except
on
the
where
it
has
the
steep
for
a
fortification
on
the
south
side
of
the
town
the
hill
is
i
believe
rather
more
lofty
than
that
on
the
north
side
and
here
is
that
cliff
which
is
described
by
shakspeare
in
the
play
of
king
lear
it
is
fearfully
steep
certainly
very
nearly
perpendicular
for
a
considerable
distance
the
grass
grows
well
to
the
very
tip
of
the
cliff
and
you
see
cows
and
sheep
grazing
there
with
as
much
unconcern
as
if
grazing
in
the
bottom
of
a
valley
it
was
not
however
these
natural
curiosities
that
took
me
over
hill
i
went
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
something
of
the
sorts
of
means
that
had
been
made
use
of
to
squander
away
countless
millions
of
money
here
is
a
hill
containing
probably
a
couple
of
square
miles
or
more
hollowed
like
a
honeycomb
here
are
line
upon
line
trench
upon
trench
cavern
upon
cavern
upon
in
short
the
very
sight
of
the
thing
convinces
you
that
either
madness
the
most
humiliating
or
profligacy
the
most
scandalous
must
have
been
at
work
here
for
years
the
question
that
every
man
of
sense
asks
is
what
reason
had
you
to
suppose
that
the
could
ever
come
to
this
to
attack
it
while
the
rest
of
the
country
was
so
much
more
easy
to
assail
however
let
any
man
of
good
plain
understanding
go
and
look
at
the
works
that
have
here
been
performed
and
that
are
now
all
tumbling
into
ruin
let
him
ask
what
this
cavern
was
for
what
that
ditch
was
for
what
this
tank
was
for
and
why
all
these
horrible
holes
and
at
an
expense
of
millions
upon
millions
let
this
scene
be
brought
and
placed
under
the
eyes
of
the
people
of
england
and
let
them
be
told
that
pitt
and
dundas
and
perceval
had
these
things
done
to
prevent
the
country
from
being
conquered
with
voice
unanimous
the
nation
would
instantly
exclaim
let
the
french
or
let
the
devil
take
us
rather
than
let
us
resort
to
means
of
defence
like
these
this
is
perhaps
the
only
set
of
fortifications
in
the
world
ever
framed
for
mere
there
is
no
appearance
of
any
intention
to
annoy
an
enemy
it
is
a
parcel
of
holes
made
in
a
hill
to
hide
englishmen
from
frenchmen
just
as
if
the
frenchmen
would
come
to
this
hill
just
as
if
they
would
not
go
if
they
came
at
all
and
land
in
romney
marsh
or
on
pevensey
level
or
anywhere
else
rather
than
come
to
this
hill
rather
than
come
to
crawl
up
shakspeare
cliff
all
the
way
along
the
coast
from
this
very
hill
to
portsmouth
or
pretty
nearly
all
the
way
is
a
flat
what
the
devil
should
they
come
to
this
hill
for
then
and
when
you
ask
this
question
they
tell
you
that
it
is
to
have
an
army
here
the
french
after
they
had
marched
into
the
country
and
for
a
purpose
like
this
for
a
purpose
so
stupid
so
senseless
so
mad
as
this
and
withal
so
scandalously
disgraceful
more
brick
and
stone
have
been
buried
in
this
hill
than
would
go
to
build
a
neat
new
cottage
for
every
labouring
man
in
the
counties
of
kent
and
of
sussex
dreadful
is
the
scourge
of
such
ministers
however
those
who
supported
them
will
now
have
to
suffer
the
money
must
have
been
squandered
purposely
and
for
the
worst
ends
fool
as
pitt
was
unfit
as
an
old
hack
of
a
lawyer
like
dundas
was
to
judge
of
the
means
of
defending
the
country
stupid
as
both
these
fellows
were
and
as
their
brother
lawyer
perceval
was
too
unfit
as
these
lawyers
were
to
judge
in
any
such
a
case
they
must
have
known
that
this
was
an
useless
expenditure
of
money
they
must
have
known
that
and
therefore
their
general
folly
their
general
ignorance
is
no
apology
for
their
conduct
what
they
wanted
was
to
prevent
the
landing
not
of
frenchmen
but
of
french
principles
that
is
to
say
to
prevent
the
example
of
the
french
from
being
alluring
to
the
people
of
england
the
devil
a
bit
did
they
care
for
the
bourbons
they
rejoiced
at
the
killing
of
the
king
they
rejoiced
at
the
atheistical
decree
they
rejoiced
at
everything
calculated
to
alarm
the
timid
and
to
excite
horror
in
the
people
of
england
in
general
they
wanted
to
keep
out
of
england
those
principles
which
had
a
natural
tendency
to
destroy
and
to
put
an
end
to
peculation
and
plunder
no
matter
whether
by
the
means
of
martello
towers
making
a
great
a
cutting
a
canal
thirty
feet
wide
to
stop
the
march
of
the
armies
of
the
danube
and
the
rhine
no
matter
how
they
squandered
the
money
so
that
it
silenced
some
and
made
others
bawl
to
answer
their
great
purpose
of
preventing
french
example
from
having
an
influence
in
england
simply
their
object
was
this
to
make
the
french
people
miserable
to
force
back
the
bourbons
upon
them
as
a
of
making
them
miserable
to
degrade
france
to
make
the
people
wretched
and
then
to
have
to
say
to
the
people
of
england
look
there
what
they
have
got
by
their
attempts
to
obtain
this
was
their
object
they
did
not
want
martello
towers
and
and
mad
canals
they
did
not
want
these
to
keep
out
the
french
armies
the
and
the
parsons
cared
nothing
about
the
french
armies
it
was
the
french
example
that
the
lawyers
and
parsons
wished
to
keep
out
and
what
have
they
done
it
is
impossible
to
be
upon
this
hill
upon
this
enormous
mass
of
expenditure
without
seeing
the
of
calais
and
the
of
france
at
this
season
it
is
impossible
to
see
those
fields
without
knowing
that
the
farmers
are
getting
in
their
corn
there
as
well
as
here
and
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
that
fact
without
reflecting
at
the
same
time
on
the
example
which
the
farmers
of
france
hold
out
to
the
farmers
of
england
looking
down
from
this
very
hill
this
day
i
saw
the
shocks
of
wheat
and
barley
left
in
the
field
after
the
farmer
had
taken
his
away
turning
my
head
and
looking
across
the
channel
there
said
i
pointing
to
france
there
the
spirited
and
sensible
people
have
ridded
themselves
of
this
burden
of
which
our
farmers
so
bitterly
complain
it
is
impossible
not
to
recollect
here
that
in
numerous
petitions
sent
up
too
by
the
complaints
have
been
made
that
the
english
farmer
has
to
carry
on
a
competition
against
the
french
farmer
who
has
tithes
to
well
why
do
not
you
petition
then
to
be
relieved
from
tithes
what
do
you
mean
else
do
you
mean
to
call
upon
our
big
gentlemen
at
whitehall
for
them
to
compel
the
french
to
pay
tithes
oh
you
loyal
fools
better
hold
your
tongues
about
the
french
not
paying
tithes
better
do
that
at
any
rate
for
never
will
they
pay
tithes
again
here
is
a
large
tract
of
upon
these
hills
at
dover
which
is
the
property
of
the
public
having
been
purchased
at
an
enormous
expense
this
is
now
let
out
as
pasture
land
to
people
of
the
town
i
dare
say
that
the
letting
of
this
land
is
a
curious
affair
if
there
were
a
member
for
dover
who
would
do
what
he
ought
to
do
he
would
soon
get
before
the
public
a
list
of
the
tenants
and
of
the
rents
paid
by
them
i
should
like
very
much
to
see
such
list
butterworth
the
bookseller
in
he
who
is
a
sort
of
metropolitan
of
the
methodists
is
one
of
the
members
for
dover
the
other
is
i
believe
that
wilbraham
or
bootle
or
bootle
wilbraham
or
some
such
name
that
is
a
lancashire
magistrate
so
that
dover
is
prettily
set
up
however
there
is
nothing
of
this
sort
that
can
in
the
present
state
of
things
be
deemed
to
be
of
any
real
consequence
as
long
as
the
people
at
whitehall
can
go
on
paying
the
interest
of
the
debt
in
full
so
long
will
there
be
no
change
worth
the
attention
of
any
rational
man
in
the
meanwhile
the
french
nation
will
be
going
on
rising
over
us
and
our
ministers
will
be
cringing
and
crawling
to
every
nation
upon
earth
who
is
known
to
possess
a
cannon
or
a
barrel
of
powder
this
very
day
i
have
read
canning
speech
at
liverpool
with
a
yankee
consul
sitting
on
his
right
hand
not
a
word
now
about
the
bits
of
bunting
and
the
fir
frigates
but
now
america
is
the
lovely
daughter
who
in
a
moment
of
excessive
love
has
gone
off
with
a
lover
to
wit
the
french
and
left
the
tender
mother
to
mourn
what
a
fop
and
this
is
the
man
that
talked
so
big
and
so
bold
this
is
the
clever
the
profound
the
blustering
too
and
above
all
things
the
high
spirited
canning
however
more
of
this
hereafter
i
must
get
from
this
dover
as
fast
as
i
can
wednesday
i
got
to
this
place
about
half
an
hour
after
the
ringing
of
the
eight
bell
or
curfew
which
i
heard
at
about
two
miles
distance
from
the
place
from
the
town
of
dover
you
come
up
the
and
have
a
most
beautiful
view
from
the
top
of
it
you
have
the
sea
the
chalk
cliffs
of
calais
the
high
land
at
boulogne
the
town
of
dover
just
under
you
the
valley
towards
folkestone
and
the
much
more
beautiful
valley
towards
canterbury
and
going
on
a
little
further
you
have
the
downs
and
the
essex
or
suffolk
coast
in
full
view
with
a
most
beautiful
corn
country
to
ride
along
through
the
corn
was
chiefly
cut
between
dover
and
walmer
the
barley
almost
all
cut
and
tied
up
in
sheaf
nothing
but
the
beans
seemed
to
remain
standing
along
here
they
are
not
quite
so
good
as
the
rest
of
the
corn
but
they
are
by
no
means
bad
when
i
came
to
the
village
of
walmer
i
enquired
for
the
castle
that
famous
place
where
pitt
dundas
perceval
and
all
the
whole
tribe
of
plotters
against
the
french
revolution
had
carried
on
their
plots
after
coming
through
the
village
of
walmer
you
see
the
entrance
of
the
castle
away
to
the
right
it
is
situated
pretty
nearly
on
the
water
edge
and
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
dell
about
a
furlong
or
so
from
the
this
is
now
the
habitation
of
our
great
minister
robert
bankes
jenkinson
son
of
charles
of
that
name
when
i
was
told
by
a
girl
who
was
leasing
in
a
field
by
the
road
side
that
that
was
walmer
castle
i
stopped
short
pulled
my
horse
round
looked
steadfastly
at
the
gateway
and
could
not
help
exclaiming
oh
thou
who
inhabitest
that
famous
dwelling
thou
who
hast
always
been
in
place
let
who
might
be
out
of
place
oh
thou
everlasting
placeman
thou
sage
of
do
but
cast
thine
eyes
upon
this
where
if
i
am
not
greatly
deceived
there
are
from
seven
to
eight
quarters
upon
the
acre
oh
thou
whose
newspaper
has
just
informed
its
readers
that
wheat
will
be
seventy
shillings
the
quarter
in
the
month
of
november
oh
thou
wise
man
i
pray
thee
come
forth
from
thy
castle
and
tell
me
what
thou
wilt
do
if
wheat
should
happen
to
be
at
the
appointed
time
shillings
instead
of
seventy
shillings
the
quarter
sage
of
farewell
if
thou
hast
life
thou
wilt
be
minister
as
long
as
thou
canst
pay
the
interest
of
the
debt
in
full
but
not
one
moment
longer
the
moment
thou
ceasest
to
be
able
to
squeeze
from
the
normans
a
sufficiency
to
count
down
to
the
jews
their
full
tale
that
moment
thou
great
man
thou
wilt
begin
to
be
taught
the
true
meaning
of
the
words
deal
is
a
most
villanous
place
it
is
full
of
people
great
desolation
of
abomination
has
been
going
on
here
tremendous
barracks
partly
pulled
down
and
partly
tumbling
down
and
partly
occupied
by
soldiers
everything
seems
upon
the
perish
i
was
glad
to
hurry
along
through
it
and
to
leave
its
inns
and
to
be
occupied
by
the
tarred
and
trowsered
and
crew
whose
very
vicinage
i
always
detest
from
deal
you
come
along
to
upper
deal
which
it
seems
was
the
original
village
thence
upon
a
beautiful
road
to
sandwich
which
is
a
rotten
borough
rottenness
putridity
is
excellent
for
land
but
bad
for
boroughs
this
place
which
is
as
villanous
a
hole
as
one
would
wish
to
see
is
surrounded
by
some
of
the
finest
land
in
the
world
along
on
one
side
of
it
lies
a
marsh
on
the
other
sides
of
it
is
land
which
they
tell
me
bears
of
wheat
to
an
acre
it
is
certainly
very
fine
for
i
saw
large
pieces
of
on
the
road
side
this
seed
is
grown
for
the
seedsmen
in
london
and
it
will
grow
on
none
but
rich
land
all
the
corn
is
carried
here
except
some
beans
and
some
barley
thursday
afternoon
in
quitting
sandwich
you
immediately
cross
a
river
up
which
vessels
bring
coals
from
the
sea
this
marsh
is
about
a
couple
of
miles
wide
it
begins
at
the
opposite
the
downs
to
my
right
hand
coming
from
sandwich
and
it
wheels
round
to
my
left
and
ends
at
the
opposite
margate
roads
this
marsh
was
formerly
covered
with
the
sea
very
likely
and
hence
the
land
within
this
sort
of
the
name
of
which
is
thanet
was
called
an
it
is
in
fact
an
island
now
for
the
same
reason
that
portsea
is
an
island
and
that
new
york
is
an
island
for
there
certainly
is
the
water
in
this
river
that
goes
round
and
connects
one
part
of
the
sea
with
the
other
i
had
to
cross
this
river
and
to
cross
the
marsh
before
i
got
into
the
famous
isle
of
thanet
which
it
was
my
intention
to
cross
soon
after
crossing
the
river
i
passed
by
a
place
for
making
salt
and
could
not
help
recollecting
that
there
are
no
excisemen
in
these
places
in
france
that
before
the
revolution
the
french
were
most
cruelly
oppressed
by
the
duties
on
salt
that
they
had
to
endure
on
that
account
the
most
horrid
tyranny
that
ever
was
known
except
perhaps
that
practised
in
an
that
shall
here
be
nameless
that
thousands
and
thousands
of
men
and
women
were
every
year
sent
to
the
galleys
for
what
was
called
smuggling
salt
that
the
fathers
and
even
the
mothers
were
imprisoned
or
whipped
if
the
children
were
detected
in
smuggling
salt
i
could
not
help
reflecting
with
delight
as
i
looked
at
these
in
the
isle
of
thanet
i
could
not
help
reflecting
that
in
spite
of
pitt
dundas
perceval
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
in
spite
of
the
caverns
of
dover
and
the
martello
towers
in
romney
marsh
in
spite
of
all
the
spies
and
all
the
bayonets
and
the
six
hundred
millions
of
debt
and
the
hundred
and
fifty
millions
of
and
the
two
hundred
millions
of
that
are
now
squeezing
the
squeezing
the
farmers
puzzling
the
fellows
at
whitehall
and
making
a
scene
of
greater
interest
than
the
chamber
of
the
privy
council
with
delight
as
i
jogged
along
under
the
first
beams
of
the
sun
i
reflected
that
in
spite
of
all
the
malignant
measures
that
had
brought
so
much
misery
upon
england
the
gallant
french
people
had
ridded
themselves
of
the
tyranny
which
sent
them
to
the
galleys
for
endeavouring
to
use
without
tax
the
salt
which
god
sent
upon
their
shores
can
any
man
tell
why
we
should
still
be
paying
five
or
six
or
seven
shillings
a
bushel
for
salt
instead
of
one
we
did
pay
fifteen
shillings
a
bushel
tax
and
why
is
two
shillings
a
bushel
kept
on
because
if
they
were
taken
off
the
crew
must
be
discharged
this
tax
of
two
shillings
a
bushel
causes
the
consumer
to
pay
five
at
the
least
more
than
he
would
if
there
were
no
tax
at
all
when
great
god
when
shall
we
be
allowed
to
enjoy
god
gifts
in
freedom
as
the
people
of
france
enjoy
them
on
the
marsh
i
found
the
same
sort
of
sheep
as
on
romney
marsh
but
the
cattle
here
are
chiefly
welsh
black
and
called
runts
they
are
nice
hardy
cattle
and
i
am
told
that
this
is
the
description
of
cattle
that
they
fat
all
the
way
up
on
this
north
side
of
when
i
got
upon
the
corn
land
in
the
isle
of
thanet
i
got
into
a
garden
indeed
there
is
hardly
any
fallow
comparatively
few
turnips
it
is
a
country
of
corn
most
of
the
harvest
is
in
but
there
are
some
fields
of
wheat
and
of
barley
not
yet
housed
a
great
many
pieces
of
lucerne
and
all
of
them
very
fine
i
left
ramsgate
to
my
right
about
three
miles
and
went
right
across
the
island
to
margate
but
that
place
is
so
thickly
settled
with
cuckolds
at
this
time
of
the
year
that
having
no
fancy
to
get
their
horns
stuck
into
me
i
turned
away
to
my
left
when
i
got
within
about
half
a
mile
of
the
town
i
got
to
a
little
hamlet
where
i
breakfasted
but
could
get
no
corn
for
my
horse
and
no
bacon
for
myself
all
was
corn
around
me
barns
i
should
think
two
hundred
feet
long
ricks
of
enormous
size
and
most
numerous
crops
of
wheat
five
quarters
to
an
acre
on
the
average
and
a
without
either
bacon
or
corn
the
labourers
houses
all
along
through
this
island
beggarly
in
the
extreme
the
people
dirty
ragged
but
particularly
the
men
and
boys
with
dirty
faces
and
dirty
and
dirty
shirts
and
good
god
what
a
difference
between
the
wife
of
a
labouring
man
here
and
the
wife
of
a
labouring
man
in
the
forests
and
woodlands
of
hampshire
and
sussex
invariably
have
i
observed
that
the
richer
the
soil
and
the
more
destitute
of
woods
that
is
to
say
the
more
purely
a
corn
country
the
more
miserable
the
labourers
the
cause
is
this
the
great
the
big
bull
frog
grasps
all
in
this
beautiful
island
every
inch
of
land
is
appropriated
by
the
rich
no
hedges
no
ditches
no
commons
no
grassy
lanes
a
country
divided
into
great
farms
a
few
trees
surround
the
great
all
the
rest
is
bare
of
trees
and
the
wretched
labourer
has
not
a
stick
of
wood
and
has
no
place
for
a
pig
or
cow
to
graze
or
even
to
lie
down
upon
the
rabbit
countries
are
the
countries
for
labouring
men
there
the
ground
is
not
so
valuable
there
it
is
not
so
easily
appropriated
by
the
few
here
in
this
island
the
work
is
almost
all
done
by
the
horses
the
horses
plough
the
ground
they
sow
the
ground
they
hoe
the
ground
they
carry
the
corn
home
they
thresh
it
out
and
they
carry
it
to
market
nay
in
this
island
they
the
ground
they
rake
up
the
straggling
straws
and
ears
so
that
they
do
the
whole
except
the
reaping
and
the
mowing
it
is
impossible
to
have
an
idea
of
anything
more
miserable
than
the
state
of
the
labourers
in
this
part
of
the
country
after
coming
by
margate
i
passed
a
village
called
monckton
and
another
called
sarr
at
sarr
there
is
a
bridge
over
which
you
come
out
of
the
island
as
you
go
into
it
over
the
bridge
at
sandwich
at
monckton
they
had
men
working
on
the
though
the
harvest
was
not
quite
in
and
though
of
course
it
had
all
to
be
threshed
out
but
at
monckton
they
had
threshing
and
they
have
three
threshing
machines
at
sarr
though
there
also
they
have
several
men
upon
the
roads
this
is
a
shocking
state
of
things
and
in
spite
of
everything
that
the
jenkinsons
and
the
scots
can
do
this
state
of
things
must
be
changed
at
sarr
or
a
little
way
further
back
i
saw
a
man
who
had
just
begun
to
reap
a
field
of
canary
seed
the
plants
were
too
far
advanced
to
be
cut
in
order
to
be
bleached
for
the
making
of
plat
but
i
got
the
reaper
to
select
me
a
few
green
stalks
that
grew
near
a
bush
that
stood
on
the
outside
of
the
piece
these
i
have
brought
on
with
me
in
order
to
give
them
a
trial
at
sarr
i
began
to
cross
the
marsh
and
had
after
this
to
come
through
the
village
of
and
another
village
called
steady
before
i
got
to
canterbury
at
i
was
struck
with
the
words
written
upon
a
board
which
was
fastened
upon
a
pole
which
pole
was
standing
in
a
garden
near
a
neat
little
box
of
a
house
the
words
were
these
paradise
place
guns
and
steel
traps
are
set
a
pretty
idea
it
must
give
us
of
paradise
to
know
that
spring
guns
and
steel
traps
are
set
in
it
this
is
doubtless
some
place
for
in
the
first
place
the
name
is
likely
to
have
been
selected
by
one
of
that
crew
and
in
the
next
place
whenever
any
of
them
go
to
the
country
they
look
upon
it
that
they
are
to
begin
a
sort
of
warfare
against
everything
around
them
they
invariably
look
upon
every
labourer
as
a
thief
as
you
approach
canterbury
from
the
isle
of
thanet
you
have
another
instance
of
the
squanderings
of
the
lawyer
ministers
nothing
equals
the
ditches
the
caverns
the
holes
the
tanks
and
of
the
hill
at
dover
but
considerable
as
the
city
of
canterbury
is
that
city
within
its
gates
stands
upon
less
ground
than
those
horrible
erections
the
barracks
of
pitt
dundas
and
perceval
they
are
perfectly
enormous
but
thanks
be
unto
god
they
begin
to
crumble
down
they
have
a
sickly
hue
all
is
lassitude
about
them
endless
are
their
lawns
their
gravel
walks
and
their
ornaments
but
their
lawns
are
unshaven
their
gravel
walks
grassy
and
their
ornaments
putting
on
the
garments
of
ugliness
you
see
the
grass
growing
opposite
the
a
hole
in
the
window
strikes
you
here
and
there
there
are
but
no
lamps
here
are
a
whole
country
of
barracks
but
only
here
and
there
a
soldier
the
thing
is
actually
perishing
it
is
typical
of
the
state
of
the
great
thing
of
things
it
gave
me
inexpressible
pleasure
to
perceive
the
gloom
that
seemed
to
hang
over
these
barracks
which
once
swarmed
with
soldiers
and
their
blithe
companions
as
a
hive
swarms
with
bees
these
barracks
now
look
like
the
environs
of
a
hive
in
winter
westminster
abbey
church
is
not
the
place
for
the
monument
of
pitt
the
statue
of
the
great
snorting
bawler
ought
to
be
stuck
up
here
just
in
the
midst
of
this
hundred
or
two
of
acres
covered
with
barracks
these
barracks
too
were
erected
in
order
to
compel
the
french
to
return
to
the
payment
of
tithes
in
order
to
bring
their
necks
again
under
the
yoke
of
the
lords
and
the
clergy
that
has
not
been
accomplished
the
french
as
hoggart
assures
us
have
neither
tithes
taxes
nor
rates
and
the
people
of
canterbury
know
that
they
have
a
to
pay
while
hoggart
of
tells
them
that
he
has
farms
to
let
in
france
where
there
are
and
where
there
is
no
they
have
lately
had
races
at
canterbury
and
the
mayor
and
aldermen
in
order
to
get
the
prince
leopold
to
attend
them
presented
him
with
the
freedom
of
the
city
but
it
rained
all
the
time
and
he
did
not
come
the
mayor
and
aldermen
do
not
understand
things
half
so
well
as
this
german
gentleman
who
has
managed
his
matters
as
well
i
think
as
any
one
that
i
ever
heard
of
this
fine
old
town
or
rather
city
is
remarkable
for
cleanliness
and
niceness
notwithstanding
it
has
a
cathedral
in
it
the
country
round
it
is
very
rich
and
this
year
while
the
hops
are
so
bad
in
most
other
parts
they
are
not
so
very
bad
just
about
canterbury
farm
near
faversham
friday
morning
in
going
through
canterbury
yesterday
i
gave
a
boy
to
hold
my
horse
while
i
went
into
the
cathedral
just
to
thank
swithin
for
the
trick
that
he
had
played
my
friends
the
quakers
led
along
by
the
wet
weather
till
after
the
harvest
had
actually
begun
and
then
to
find
the
weather
turn
fine
all
of
a
sudden
this
must
have
soused
them
pretty
decently
and
i
hear
of
one
who
at
canterbury
has
made
a
bargain
by
which
he
will
certainly
lose
two
thousand
pounds
the
land
where
i
am
now
is
equal
to
that
of
the
isle
of
thanet
the
harvest
is
nearly
over
and
all
the
crops
have
been
prodigiously
fine
in
coming
from
canterbury
you
come
to
the
top
of
a
hill
called
baughton
hill
at
four
miles
from
canterbury
on
the
london
road
and
you
there
look
down
into
one
of
the
finest
flats
in
england
a
piece
of
marsh
comes
up
nearly
to
faversham
and
at
the
edge
of
that
marsh
lies
the
farm
where
i
now
am
the
land
here
is
a
deep
loam
upon
chalk
and
this
is
also
the
nature
of
the
land
in
the
isle
of
thanet
and
all
the
way
from
that
to
dover
the
orchards
grow
well
upon
this
soil
the
trees
grow
finely
the
fruit
is
large
and
of
fine
flavour
in
i
gave
william
waller
who
lives
here
some
american
and
he
has
now
some
as
fine
newtown
pippins
as
one
would
wish
to
see
they
are
very
large
of
their
sort
very
free
in
their
growth
and
they
promise
to
be
very
fine
apples
of
the
kind
waller
had
cuttings
from
me
off
several
sorts
in
these
were
cut
down
last
year
they
have
of
course
made
shoots
this
summer
and
great
numbers
of
these
shoots
have
which
will
have
blossom
if
not
fruit
next
year
this
very
rarely
happens
i
believe
and
the
state
of
waller
trees
clearly
proves
to
me
that
the
introduction
of
these
american
trees
would
be
a
great
improvement
my
american
apples
when
i
left
kensington
promised
to
be
very
fine
and
the
apples
which
i
have
frequently
mentioned
as
being
upon
cuttings
imported
last
spring
promised
to
come
to
perfection
a
thing
which
i
believe
we
have
not
an
instance
of
before
friday
evening
a
friend
at
tenterden
told
me
that
if
i
had
a
mind
to
know
kent
i
must
go
through
romney
marsh
to
dover
from
dover
to
sandwich
from
sandwich
to
margate
from
margate
to
canterbury
from
canterbury
to
faversham
from
faversham
to
maidstone
and
from
maidstone
to
tonbridge
i
found
from
waller
this
morning
that
the
regular
turnpike
route
from
his
house
to
maidstone
was
through
sittingbourne
i
had
been
along
that
road
several
times
and
besides
to
be
covered
with
dust
was
what
i
could
not
think
of
when
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
get
to
maidstone
without
it
i
took
the
road
across
the
country
quitting
the
london
road
or
rather
crossing
it
in
the
dell
between
ospringe
and
i
instantly
began
to
go
up
hill
slowly
indeed
but
up
hill
i
came
through
the
villages
of
newnham
doddington
ringlestone
and
to
that
of
hollingbourne
i
had
come
up
hill
for
thirteen
miles
from
waller
house
at
last
i
got
to
the
top
of
this
hill
and
went
along
for
some
distance
upon
level
ground
i
found
i
was
got
upon
just
the
same
sort
of
land
as
that
on
the
hill
at
folkestone
at
reigate
at
ropley
and
at
ashmansworth
the
red
clayey
loam
mixed
up
with
great
yellow
flint
stones
i
found
fine
meadows
here
just
such
as
are
at
ashmansworth
that
is
to
say
on
the
north
hampshire
hills
this
sort
of
ground
is
characterized
by
an
astonishing
depth
that
they
have
to
go
for
the
water
at
ashmansworth
they
go
to
a
depth
of
more
than
three
hundred
feet
as
i
was
riding
along
upon
the
top
of
this
hill
in
kent
i
saw
the
same
beautiful
sort
of
meadows
that
there
are
at
ashmansworth
i
saw
the
corn
backward
i
was
just
thinking
to
go
up
to
some
house
to
ask
how
far
they
had
to
go
for
water
when
i
saw
a
large
and
all
the
chains
and
wheels
belonging
to
such
a
concern
but
here
was
also
the
tackle
for
a
to
work
in
drawing
up
the
water
i
asked
about
the
depth
of
the
well
and
the
information
i
received
must
have
been
incorrect
because
i
was
told
it
was
three
hundred
yards
i
asked
this
of
a
keeper
farther
on
not
seeing
anybody
where
the
was
i
make
no
doubt
that
the
depth
is
as
near
as
possible
that
of
ashmansworth
upon
the
top
of
this
hill
i
saw
the
finest
field
of
beans
that
i
have
seen
this
year
and
by
very
far
indeed
the
piece
of
a
beautiful
piece
of
hops
surrounded
by
beautiful
plantations
of
young
ash
producing
poles
for
my
road
here
pointed
towards
the
west
it
soon
wheeled
round
towards
the
south
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
found
myself
upon
the
edge
of
a
hill
as
lofty
and
as
steep
as
that
at
folkestone
at
reigate
or
at
ashmansworth
it
was
the
same
famous
that
i
was
crossing
again
when
i
got
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
and
before
i
got
off
my
horse
to
lead
him
down
this
more
than
mile
of
hill
i
sat
and
surveyed
the
prospect
before
me
and
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
this
is
what
the
people
of
kent
call
the
of
it
is
a
district
of
meadows
and
orchards
of
apples
pears
cherries
and
filberts
with
very
little
if
any
land
which
can
not
with
propriety
be
called
good
there
are
plantations
of
chestnut
and
of
ash
frequently
occurring
and
as
these
are
cut
when
long
enough
to
make
poles
for
hops
they
are
at
all
times
objects
of
great
beauty
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
is
the
village
of
hollingbourne
thence
you
come
on
to
maidstone
from
maidstone
to
this
place
merryworth
is
about
seven
miles
and
these
are
the
finest
seven
miles
that
i
have
ever
seen
in
england
or
anywhere
else
the
medway
is
to
your
left
with
its
meadows
about
a
mile
wide
you
cross
the
medway
in
coming
out
of
maidstone
and
it
goes
and
finds
its
way
down
to
rochester
through
a
break
in
the
from
maidstone
to
merryworth
i
should
think
that
there
were
on
one
half
of
the
way
on
both
sides
of
the
road
then
looking
across
the
medway
you
see
and
orchards
two
miles
deep
on
the
side
of
a
gently
rising
ground
and
this
continues
with
you
all
the
way
from
maidstone
to
merryworth
the
orchards
form
a
great
feature
of
the
country
and
the
plantations
of
ashes
and
of
chestnuts
that
i
mentioned
before
add
greatly
to
the
beauty
these
gardens
of
hops
are
kept
very
clean
in
general
though
some
of
them
have
been
neglected
this
year
owing
to
the
bad
appearance
of
the
crop
the
culture
is
sometimes
mixed
that
is
to
say
or
or
and
hops
in
the
same
ground
this
is
a
good
way
they
say
of
raising
an
orchard
i
do
not
believe
it
and
i
think
that
nothing
is
gained
by
any
of
these
mixtures
they
plant
or
in
rows
here
they
then
plant
a
close
to
each
of
these
large
and
then
they
cultivate
the
middle
of
the
ground
by
planting
potatoes
this
is
being
too
greedy
it
is
impossible
that
they
can
gain
by
this
what
they
gain
one
way
they
lose
the
other
way
and
i
verily
believe
that
the
most
profitable
way
would
be
never
to
mix
things
at
all
in
coming
from
maidstone
i
passed
through
a
village
called
teston
where
lord
basham
has
a
seat
saturday
morning
i
came
off
from
merryworth
a
little
before
five
passed
the
seat
of
lord
torrington
the
friend
of
barretto
this
barretto
ought
not
to
be
forgotten
so
soon
in
he
sued
for
articles
of
the
peace
against
lord
torrington
for
having
menaced
him
in
consequence
of
his
having
pressed
his
lordship
about
some
money
it
seems
that
lord
torrington
had
known
him
in
the
east
indies
that
they
came
home
together
or
soon
after
one
another
that
his
lordship
invited
barretto
to
his
best
parties
in
india
that
he
got
him
introduced
at
court
in
england
by
sidmouth
that
he
got
him
made
a
of
the
royal
and
that
he
tried
to
get
him
introduced
into
parliament
his
lordship
when
barretto
rudely
pressed
him
for
his
money
reminded
him
of
all
this
and
of
the
many
difficulties
that
he
had
had
to
overcome
with
regard
to
his
and
so
forth
nevertheless
the
dingy
skinned
court
visitant
pressed
in
such
a
way
that
lord
torrington
was
obliged
to
be
pretty
smart
with
him
whereupon
the
other
sued
for
articles
of
the
peace
against
his
lordship
but
these
were
not
granted
by
the
court
this
barretto
issued
a
at
the
last
election
as
a
candidate
for
albans
i
am
truly
sorry
that
he
was
not
elected
lord
camelford
threatened
to
put
in
his
black
fellow
but
he
was
a
sad
swaggering
fellow
and
had
at
last
too
much
of
the
in
him
to
do
a
thing
so
meritorious
lord
torrington
is
but
an
indifferent
looking
place
i
here
began
to
see
southdown
sheep
again
which
i
had
not
seen
since
the
time
i
left
tenterden
all
along
here
the
villages
are
at
not
more
than
two
miles
distance
from
each
other
they
have
all
large
churches
and
scarcely
anybody
to
go
to
them
at
a
village
called
hadlow
there
is
a
house
belonging
to
a
may
the
most
singular
looking
thing
i
ever
saw
an
immense
house
stuck
all
over
with
a
parcel
of
chimneys
or
things
like
chimneys
little
brick
columns
with
a
sort
of
caps
on
them
looking
like
carnation
sticks
with
caps
at
the
top
to
catch
the
earwigs
the
building
is
all
of
brick
and
has
the
oddest
appearance
of
anything
i
ever
saw
this
tonbridge
is
but
a
common
country
town
though
very
clean
and
the
people
looking
very
well
the
climate
must
be
pretty
warm
here
for
in
entering
the
town
i
saw
a
large
althea
frutex
in
bloom
a
thing
rare
enough
any
year
and
particularly
a
year
like
this
saturday
noon
instead
of
going
on
to
the
wen
along
the
turnpike
road
through
sevenoaks
i
turned
to
my
left
when
i
got
about
a
mile
out
of
tonbridge
in
order
to
come
along
that
tract
of
country
called
the
weald
of
kent
that
is
to
say
the
solid
clays
which
have
no
bottom
which
are
unmixed
with
chalk
sand
stone
or
anything
else
the
country
of
dirty
roads
and
of
oak
trees
i
stopped
at
tonbridge
only
a
few
minutes
but
in
the
weald
i
stopped
to
breakfast
at
a
place
called
leigh
from
leigh
i
came
to
chittingstone
causeway
leaving
tonbridge
wells
six
miles
over
the
hills
to
my
left
from
chittingstone
i
came
to
thence
to
four
elms
and
thence
to
this
little
of
westerham
which
is
just
upon
the
border
of
kent
indeed
kent
surrey
and
sussex
form
a
joining
very
near
to
this
town
westerham
exactly
like
reigate
and
godstone
and
sevenoaks
and
dorking
and
folkestone
lies
between
the
and
the
the
valley
is
here
a
little
wider
than
at
reigate
and
that
is
all
the
difference
there
is
between
the
places
as
soon
as
you
get
over
the
sand
hill
to
the
south
of
reigate
you
get
into
the
weald
of
surrey
and
here
as
soon
as
you
get
over
the
sand
hill
to
the
south
of
westerham
you
get
into
the
weald
of
kent
i
have
now
in
order
to
get
to
the
wen
to
cross
the
once
more
and
at
a
point
where
i
never
crossed
it
before
coming
through
the
weald
i
found
the
corn
very
good
and
low
as
the
ground
is
wet
as
it
is
cold
as
it
is
there
will
be
very
little
of
the
wheat
which
will
not
be
housed
before
saturday
night
all
the
corn
is
good
and
the
barley
excellent
not
far
from
i
saw
two
oak
trees
one
of
which
was
they
told
me
more
than
thirty
feet
round
and
the
other
more
than
but
they
have
been
hollow
for
half
a
century
they
are
not
much
bigger
than
the
oak
upon
tilford
green
if
any
i
mean
in
the
trunk
but
they
are
hollow
while
that
tree
is
sound
in
all
its
parts
and
growing
still
i
have
had
a
most
beautiful
ride
through
the
weald
the
day
is
very
hot
but
i
have
been
in
the
shade
and
my
feet
very
often
in
the
rivulets
and
wet
lanes
in
one
place
i
rode
above
a
mile
completely
arched
over
by
the
boughs
of
the
underwood
growing
in
the
banks
of
the
lane
what
an
odd
taste
that
man
must
have
who
prefers
a
to
a
lane
like
this
very
near
to
westerham
there
are
hops
and
i
have
seen
now
and
then
a
little
bit
of
hop
garden
even
in
the
weald
hops
will
grow
well
where
lucerne
will
grow
well
and
lucerne
will
grow
well
where
there
is
a
rich
top
and
a
dry
bottom
when
therefore
you
see
hops
in
the
weald
it
is
on
the
side
of
some
hill
where
there
is
sand
or
stone
at
bottom
and
not
where
there
is
real
clay
beneath
there
appear
to
be
hops
here
and
there
all
along
from
nearly
at
dover
to
alton
in
hampshire
you
find
them
all
along
kent
you
find
them
at
westerham
across
at
worth
in
sussex
at
godstone
in
surrey
over
to
the
north
of
merrow
down
near
guildford
at
godalming
under
the
at
farnham
and
all
along
that
way
to
alton
but
there
i
think
they
end
the
whole
face
of
the
country
seems
to
rise
when
you
get
just
beyond
alton
and
to
keep
up
whether
you
look
to
the
north
the
south
or
west
the
land
seems
to
rise
and
the
hops
cease
till
you
come
again
away
to
the
in
herefordshire
saturday
night
here
i
close
my
day
at
the
end
of
miles
in
coming
up
the
chalk
hill
from
westerham
i
prepared
myself
for
the
red
stiff
loam
the
big
yellow
flints
and
the
meadows
and
i
found
them
all
i
have
now
gone
over
this
in
the
following
places
at
coombe
in
the
of
hampshire
i
mean
the
corner
the
very
extremity
of
the
county
i
have
gone
over
it
at
ashmansworth
or
highclere
going
from
newbury
to
andover
at
king
clere
going
from
newbury
to
winchester
at
ropley
going
from
alresford
to
selborne
at
dippinghall
going
from
crondall
to
thursly
at
merrow
going
from
chertsey
to
chilworth
at
reigate
at
westerham
and
then
between
these
at
godstone
at
sevenoaks
going
from
london
to
battle
at
hollingbourne
as
mentioned
above
and
at
folkestone
in
all
these
places
i
have
crossed
this
everywhere
upon
the
top
of
it
i
have
found
a
flat
and
the
soil
of
all
these
flats
i
have
found
to
be
a
red
stiff
loam
mingled
up
with
big
yellow
flints
a
soil
difficult
to
work
but
by
no
means
bad
whether
for
wood
hops
grass
orchards
or
corn
i
once
before
mentioned
that
i
was
assured
that
the
pasture
upon
these
bleak
hills
was
as
rich
as
that
which
is
found
in
the
north
of
wiltshire
in
the
neighbourhood
of
swindon
where
they
make
some
of
the
best
cheese
in
the
kingdom
upon
these
hills
i
have
never
found
the
labouring
people
poor
and
miserable
as
in
the
rich
vales
all
is
not
appropriated
where
there
are
coppices
and
wood
where
the
cultivation
is
not
so
easy
and
the
produce
so
very
large
after
getting
up
the
hill
from
westerham
i
had
a
general
descent
to
perform
all
the
way
to
the
thames
when
you
get
to
beckenham
which
is
the
last
parish
in
kent
the
country
begins
to
assume
a
appearance
all
is
artificial
and
you
no
longer
feel
any
interest
in
it
i
was
anxious
to
make
this
journey
into
kent
in
the
midst
of
harvest
in
order
that
i
might
the
real
state
of
the
crops
the
result
of
my
observations
and
my
inquiries
is
that
the
crop
is
a
crop
of
everything
except
barley
and
that
the
barley
yields
a
great
deal
more
than
an
average
crop
i
thought
that
the
beans
were
very
poor
during
my
ride
into
hampshire
but
i
then
saw
no
real
bean
countries
i
have
seen
such
countries
now
and
i
do
not
think
that
the
beans
present
us
with
a
bad
crop
as
to
the
quality
it
is
in
no
case
except
perhaps
the
barley
equal
to
that
of
last
year
we
had
last
year
an
italian
summer
when
the
wheat
or
other
grain
has
to
in
wet
it
will
not
be
as
it
will
when
it
has
to
ripen
in
fair
weather
it
will
have
a
dingy
or
clouded
appearance
and
perhaps
the
flour
may
not
be
quite
so
good
the
wheat
in
fact
will
not
be
so
heavy
in
order
to
enable
others
to
judge
as
well
as
myself
i
took
samples
from
the
fields
as
i
went
along
i
took
them
very
fairly
and
as
often
as
i
thought
that
there
was
any
material
change
in
the
soil
or
other
circumstances
during
the
ride
i
took
sixteen
samples
these
are
now
at
the
office
of
the
register
in
where
they
may
be
seen
by
any
gentleman
who
thinks
the
information
likely
to
be
useful
to
him
the
samples
are
numbered
and
there
is
a
reference
pointing
out
the
place
where
each
sample
was
taken
the
opinions
that
i
gather
amount
to
this
that
there
is
an
average
crop
of
everything
and
a
little
more
of
barley
now
then
we
shall
see
how
all
this
tallies
with
the
schemes
with
the
intentions
and
expectations
of
our
matchless
gentlemen
at
whitehall
these
wise
men
have
put
forth
their
views
in
the
of
the
of
august
and
in
words
which
ought
never
to
be
forgotten
and
which
at
any
rate
shall
be
recorded
here
during
the
present
unsettled
state
of
the
weather
it
is
impossible
for
the
best
informed
persons
to
anticipate
upon
good
grounds
what
will
be
the
future
price
of
agricultural
produce
should
the
season
even
yet
prove
favourable
for
the
operations
of
the
harvest
there
is
every
probability
of
the
average
price
of
grain
continuing
at
that
exact
price
which
will
prove
most
conducive
to
the
interests
of
the
corn
growers
and
at
the
same
time
encouraging
to
the
agriculture
of
our
colonial
possessions
we
do
not
speak
lightly
on
this
subject
for
we
are
aware
that
his
majesty
ministers
have
been
fully
alive
to
the
inquiries
from
all
qualified
quarters
as
to
the
effect
likely
to
be
produced
on
the
markets
from
the
addition
of
the
present
crops
to
the
stock
of
wheat
already
on
hand
the
result
of
these
inquiries
is
that
in
the
highest
quarters
there
exists
the
full
expectation
that
towards
the
month
of
november
the
price
of
wheat
will
nearly
approach
to
seventy
shillings
a
price
which
while
it
affords
the
extent
of
remuneration
to
the
british
farmer
recognized
by
the
corn
laws
will
at
the
same
time
admit
of
the
sale
of
the
canadian
bonded
wheat
and
the
introduction
of
this
foreign
corn
grown
by
british
colonists
will
contribute
to
keeping
down
our
markets
and
exclude
foreign
grain
from
other
quarters
there
nice
gentlemen
of
whitehall
what
pretty
gentlemen
they
are
of
surrounding
indeed
to
be
under
command
of
pretty
gentlemen
who
can
make
calculations
so
nice
and
put
forth
predictions
so
positive
upon
such
a
subject
of
the
indeed
to
live
under
the
command
of
men
who
can
so
control
seasons
and
markets
or
at
least
who
can
so
dive
into
the
secrets
of
trade
and
find
out
the
contents
of
the
fields
barns
and
ricks
as
to
be
able
to
balance
things
so
nicely
as
to
cause
the
canadian
corn
to
find
a
market
without
injuring
the
sale
of
that
of
the
british
farmer
and
without
admitting
that
of
the
french
farmer
and
the
other
farmers
of
the
continent
happy
too
happy
rogues
that
we
are
to
be
under
the
guidance
of
such
pretty
gentlemen
and
right
just
is
it
that
we
should
be
banished
for
life
if
we
utter
a
word
to
bring
such
pretty
gentlemen
into
contempt
let
it
be
observed
that
this
paragraph
have
come
from
whitehall
this
wretched
paper
is
the
organ
of
the
government
as
to
the
owners
of
the
paper
daniel
stewart
that
notorious
fellow
street
and
the
rest
of
them
not
excluding
the
brother
of
the
great
oracle
which
brother
bought
the
other
day
a
share
of
this
vehicle
of
baseness
and
folly
as
to
these
fellows
they
have
no
control
other
than
what
relates
to
the
expenditure
and
the
receipts
of
the
vehicle
they
get
their
news
from
the
offices
of
the
whitehall
people
and
their
paper
is
the
of
those
same
people
mark
this
i
pray
you
reader
and
let
the
french
people
mark
it
too
and
then
take
their
revenge
for
the
waterloo
insolence
this
being
the
case
then
this
paragraph
proceeding
from
the
pretty
gentlemen
what
a
light
it
throws
on
their
expectations
their
hopes
and
their
fears
they
see
that
wheat
at
seventy
shillings
a
quarter
is
to
them
ah
pray
mark
that
they
see
that
wheat
at
seventy
shillings
a
quarter
is
necessary
to
them
and
therefore
they
say
that
wheat
will
be
at
seventy
shillings
a
quarter
the
price
as
they
call
it
necessary
to
remunerate
the
british
farmer
and
how
do
the
conjurers
at
whitehall
know
this
why
they
have
made
full
inquiries
in
qualified
quarters
and
the
qualified
quarters
have
satisfied
the
highest
quarters
that
towards
the
month
of
november
the
price
of
wheat
will
nearly
approach
to
seventy
shillings
the
quarter
i
wonder
what
the
words
towards
the
end
of
november
may
mean
devil
i
if
middle
of
september
is
not
november
and
the
wheat
instead
of
going
on
towards
seventy
shillings
is
very
fast
coming
down
to
forty
the
beast
who
wrote
this
paragraph
the
pretty
beast
this
envy
of
surrounding
nations
wrote
it
on
the
of
august
soaking
wet
the
pretty
beast
was
not
aware
that
the
next
day
was
going
to
be
fine
and
that
we
were
to
have
only
the
succeeding
tuesday
and
half
the
following
saturday
of
wet
weather
until
the
whole
of
the
harvest
should
be
in
the
pretty
beast
wrote
while
the
rain
was
spattering
against
the
window
and
he
did
not
speak
lightly
but
was
fully
aware
that
the
highest
quarters
having
made
inquiries
of
the
qualified
quarters
were
sure
that
wheat
would
be
at
seventy
shillings
during
the
ensuing
year
what
will
be
the
price
of
wheat
it
is
impossible
for
any
one
to
say
i
know
a
gentleman
who
is
a
very
good
judge
of
such
matters
who
is
of
opinion
that
the
average
price
of
wheat
will
be
shillings
a
quarter
or
lower
before
christmas
this
is
not
quite
half
what
the
expect
in
consequence
of
the
inquiries
which
they
have
made
of
the
i
do
not
say
that
the
average
of
wheat
will
come
down
to
shillings
but
this
i
know
that
at
reading
last
saturday
about
shillings
was
the
price
and
i
hear
that
in
norfolk
the
price
is
the
and
the
infamous
london
press
will
at
any
rate
be
prettily
exposed
before
christmas
old
sir
thomas
lethbridge
too
and
gaffer
gooch
and
his
base
tribe
of
pittites
at
ipswich
coke
and
suffield
and
their
crew
all
these
will
be
prettily
laughed
at
nor
will
that
tall
soul
lord
milton
escape
being
reminded
of
his
profound
and
patriotic
observation
relative
to
this
country
no
sooner
did
he
see
the
wheat
get
up
to
sixty
or
seventy
shillings
than
he
lost
all
his
alarms
found
that
all
things
were
right
turned
his
back
on
yorkshire
reformers
and
went
and
toiled
for
scarlett
at
peterborough
and
discovered
that
there
was
nothing
wrong
at
last
and
that
the
country
would
triumph
over
all
its
difficulties
so
it
will
tall
soul
it
will
triumph
over
all
its
difficulties
it
will
renovate
itself
it
will
purge
itself
of
rotten
boroughs
of
vile
their
tools
and
their
stopgaps
it
will
purge
itself
of
all
the
villanies
which
now
corrode
its
heart
it
will
in
short
free
itself
from
those
curses
which
the
expenditure
of
eight
or
nine
hundred
millions
of
english
money
took
place
in
order
to
make
perpetual
it
will
in
short
become
free
from
oppression
as
easy
and
as
happy
as
the
gallant
and
sensible
nation
on
the
other
side
of
the
channel
this
is
the
sort
of
renovation
but
not
renovation
by
the
means
of
wheat
at
seventy
shillings
a
quarter
renovation
it
will
have
it
will
rouse
and
will
shake
from
itself
curses
like
the
pension
which
is
paid
to
burke
executors
this
is
the
sort
of
renovation
tall
soul
and
not
wheat
at
a
quarter
while
it
is
at
shillings
a
quarter
in
france
pray
observe
reader
how
the
tall
soul
at
the
rise
in
the
price
of
wheat
how
he
at
it
how
quickly
he
ceased
his
attacks
upon
the
whitehall
people
and
upon
the
system
he
thought
he
had
been
deceived
he
thought
that
things
were
coming
about
again
and
so
he
drew
in
his
horns
and
began
to
talk
about
the
country
this
was
the
tone
of
them
this
was
the
tone
of
all
the
all
the
friends
of
the
system
all
those
who
like
lethbridge
had
begun
to
be
staggered
they
had
deviated
for
a
moment
into
our
path
but
they
popped
back
again
the
moment
they
saw
the
price
of
wheat
rise
all
the
enemies
of
reform
all
the
calumniators
of
reformers
all
the
friends
of
the
system
most
anxiously
desired
a
rise
in
the
price
of
wheat
mark
the
curious
fact
that
all
the
vile
press
of
london
the
whole
of
that
infamous
press
that
newspapers
magazines
reviews
the
whole
of
the
base
thing
and
a
baser
surely
this
world
never
saw
that
the
whole
of
this
base
thing
rejoiced
exulted
crowed
over
me
and
told
an
impudent
lie
in
order
to
have
the
crowing
crowed
for
what
wheat
and
bread
were
become
dear
a
newspaper
hatched
under
a
corrupt
priest
a
profligate
priest
and
recently
espoused
to
the
hell
of
pall
mall
even
this
vile
thing
crowed
because
wheat
and
bread
had
become
dear
now
it
is
notorious
that
heretofore
every
periodical
publication
in
this
kingdom
was
in
the
constant
habit
of
lamenting
when
bread
became
dear
and
of
rejoicing
when
it
became
cheap
this
is
notorious
nay
it
is
equally
notorious
that
this
infamous
press
was
everlastingly
assailing
bakers
and
millers
and
butchers
for
not
selling
bread
flour
and
meat
cheaper
than
they
were
selling
them
in
how
many
hundreds
of
instances
has
this
infamous
press
caused
attacks
to
be
made
by
the
mob
upon
tradesmen
of
this
description
all
these
things
are
notorious
moreover
notorious
it
is
that
long
previous
to
every
harvest
this
infamous
this
execrable
this
beastly
press
was
engaged
in
stunning
the
public
with
accounts
of
the
which
was
just
coming
forward
there
was
always
with
this
press
a
prodigiously
large
crop
this
was
invariably
the
case
it
was
never
known
to
be
the
contrary
now
these
things
are
perfectly
well
known
to
every
man
in
england
how
comes
it
then
reader
that
the
profligate
the
trading
the
lying
the
infamous
press
of
london
has
now
totally
changed
its
tone
and
bias
the
base
thing
never
now
tells
us
that
there
is
a
great
crop
or
even
a
good
crop
it
never
now
wants
cheap
bread
and
cheap
wheat
and
cheap
meat
it
never
now
finds
fault
of
bakers
and
butchers
it
now
always
endeavours
to
make
it
appear
that
corn
is
dearer
than
it
is
the
base
about
three
weeks
ago
not
only
suppressed
the
fact
of
the
fall
of
wheat
but
asserted
that
there
had
been
a
rise
in
the
price
now
is
all
that
is
a
great
question
reader
that
is
a
very
interesting
question
why
has
this
infamous
press
which
always
pursues
that
which
it
thinks
its
own
interest
why
has
it
taken
this
strange
turn
this
is
the
reason
stupid
as
the
base
thing
is
it
has
arrived
at
a
conviction
that
if
the
price
of
the
produce
of
the
land
can
not
be
kept
up
to
something
approaching
ten
shillings
a
bushel
for
good
wheat
the
hellish
system
of
funding
must
be
blown
up
the
infamous
press
has
arrived
at
a
conviction
that
that
cheating
that
fraudulent
system
by
which
this
press
lives
must
be
destroyed
unless
the
price
of
corn
can
be
kept
up
the
infamous
traders
of
the
press
are
perfectly
well
satisfied
that
the
interest
of
the
debt
must
be
reduced
unless
wheat
can
be
kept
up
to
nearly
ten
shillings
a
bushel
stupid
as
they
are
and
stupid
as
the
fellows
down
at
westminster
are
they
know
very
well
that
the
whole
system
jews
cant
and
all
go
to
the
devil
at
once
as
soon
as
a
deduction
is
made
from
the
interest
of
the
debt
knowing
this
they
want
wheat
to
sell
high
because
it
has
at
last
been
hammered
into
their
skulls
that
the
interest
can
not
be
paid
in
full
if
wheat
sells
low
delightful
is
the
dilemma
in
which
they
are
dear
bread
does
not
suit
their
manufactories
and
cheap
bread
does
not
suit
their
debt
of
surrounding
how
hard
it
is
that
providence
will
not
enable
your
farmers
to
sell
dear
and
the
consumers
to
buy
cheap
these
are
the
things
that
you
want
admiration
of
the
world
you
are
but
have
these
things
you
will
not
there
may
be
those
indeed
who
question
whether
you
yourself
know
what
you
want
but
at
any
rate
if
you
want
these
things
you
will
not
have
them
before
i
conclude
let
me
ask
the
reader
to
take
a
look
at
the
of
the
tone
and
tricks
of
this
government
is
it
not
a
novelty
in
the
world
to
see
a
government
and
in
ordinary
seasons
too
having
its
whole
soul
absorbed
in
considerations
relating
to
the
price
of
corn
there
are
our
neighbours
the
french
who
have
got
a
government
engaged
in
taking
military
possession
of
a
great
neighbouring
kingdom
to
free
which
from
these
very
french
we
have
recently
expended
a
and
fifty
millions
of
our
neighbours
have
got
a
government
that
is
thus
engaged
and
we
have
got
a
government
that
employs
itself
in
making
incessant
inquiries
in
all
the
qualified
quarters
relative
to
the
price
of
wheat
curious
employment
for
a
government
singular
occupation
for
the
ministers
of
the
great
george
they
seem
to
think
nothing
of
spain
with
its
eleven
millions
of
people
being
in
fact
added
to
france
wholly
insensible
do
they
appear
to
concerns
of
this
sort
while
they
sit
thinking
day
and
night
upon
the
price
of
the
bushel
of
wheat
however
they
are
not
after
all
such
fools
as
they
appear
to
be
despicable
indeed
must
be
that
nation
whose
safety
or
whose
happiness
does
in
any
degree
depend
on
so
fluctuating
a
thing
as
the
price
of
corn
this
is
a
matter
that
we
must
take
as
it
comes
the
seasons
will
be
what
they
will
be
and
all
the
calculations
of
statesmen
must
be
made
wholly
independent
of
the
changes
and
chances
of
seasons
this
has
always
been
the
case
to
be
sure
what
nation
could
ever
carry
on
its
affairs
if
it
had
to
take
into
consideration
the
price
of
corn
nevertheless
such
is
the
situation
of
that
its
very
existence
in
its
present
way
depends
upon
the
price
of
corn
the
pretty
fellows
at
whitehall
if
you
may
say
to
them
well
but
look
at
spain
look
at
the
enormous
strides
of
the
french
think
of
the
consequences
in
case
of
another
war
look
too
at
the
growing
marine
of
america
see
jenkinson
see
canning
see
huskisson
see
peel
and
all
ye
tribe
of
grenvilles
see
what
tremendous
dangers
are
gathering
together
about
us
aye
about
but
pray
think
what
tremendous
dangers
wheat
at
four
shillings
a
bushel
will
bring
about
this
is
the
git
here
lies
the
whole
of
it
we
laugh
at
a
government
employing
itself
in
making
calculations
about
the
price
of
corn
and
in
employing
its
press
to
put
forth
market
puffs
we
laugh
at
these
things
but
we
should
not
laugh
if
we
considered
that
it
is
on
the
price
of
wheat
that
the
duration
of
the
power
and
the
profits
of
these
men
depends
they
know
what
they
want
and
they
wish
to
believe
themselves
and
to
make
others
believe
that
they
shall
have
it
i
have
observed
before
but
it
is
necessary
to
observe
again
that
all
those
who
are
for
the
system
let
them
be
opposition
or
not
opposition
feel
as
whitehall
feels
about
the
price
of
corn
i
have
given
an
instance
in
the
tall
soul
but
it
is
the
same
with
the
whole
of
them
with
the
whole
of
those
who
do
not
wish
to
see
this
infernal
system
changed
i
was
informed
and
i
believe
it
to
be
true
that
the
marquis
of
lansdowne
said
last
april
when
the
great
rise
took
place
in
the
price
of
corn
that
he
had
always
thought
that
the
had
but
little
effect
on
prices
but
that
he
was
now
satisfied
that
those
measures
had
no
effect
at
all
on
prices
now
what
is
our
situation
what
is
the
situation
of
this
country
if
we
must
have
the
present
ministry
or
a
ministry
of
which
the
marquis
of
lansdowne
is
to
be
a
member
if
the
marquis
of
lansdowne
did
utter
these
words
and
again
i
say
that
i
verily
believe
he
did
utter
them
ours
is
a
government
that
now
seems
to
depend
very
much
upon
the
the
old
type
of
a
ship
at
sea
will
not
do
now
ours
is
a
weather
government
and
to
know
the
state
of
it
we
must
have
recourse
to
those
glasses
that
the
jews
carry
about
weather
depends
upon
the
winds
in
a
great
measure
and
i
have
no
scruple
to
say
that
the
situation
of
those
two
right
honourable
youths
that
are
now
gone
to
the
lakes
in
the
north
that
their
situation
next
winter
will
be
rendered
very
irksome
not
to
say
perilous
by
the
present
easterly
wind
if
it
should
continue
about
fifteen
days
longer
pitt
when
he
had
just
made
a
monstrous
issue
of
paper
and
had
thereby
actually
put
the
match
which
blowed
up
the
old
she
devil
in
pitt
at
that
time
congratulated
the
nation
that
the
wisdom
of
parliament
had
established
a
solid
system
of
finance
anything
but
solid
it
assuredly
was
but
his
system
of
finance
was
as
worthy
of
being
called
solid
as
that
system
of
government
which
now
manifestly
depends
upon
the
weather
and
the
winds
since
my
return
home
it
is
now
thursday
september
i
have
received
letters
from
the
east
from
the
north
and
from
the
west
all
tell
me
that
the
harvest
is
very
far
advanced
and
that
the
crops
are
free
from
blight
these
letters
are
not
particular
as
to
the
weight
of
the
crop
except
that
they
all
say
that
the
barley
is
excellent
the
wind
is
now
coming
from
the
east
there
is
every
appearance
of
the
fine
weather
continuing
before
christmas
we
shall
have
the
wheat
down
to
what
will
be
a
fair
average
price
in
future
i
always
said
that
the
late
rise
was
a
mere
puff
it
was
in
part
a
scarcity
rise
the
wheat
of
was
grown
and
bad
that
of
had
to
be
begun
upon
in
july
the
crop
has
had
to
last
thirteen
months
and
a
half
the
present
crop
will
have
to
last
only
eleven
months
or
less
the
crop
of
barley
last
year
was
so
very
bad
so
very
small
and
the
crop
of
the
year
before
so
very
bad
in
quality
that
wheat
was
malted
last
year
in
great
quantities
instead
of
barley
this
year
the
crop
of
barley
is
prodigious
all
these
things
considered
wheat
if
the
had
had
no
effect
must
have
been
a
hundred
and
forty
shillings
a
quarter
and
barley
eighty
yet
the
first
never
got
to
seventy
and
the
latter
never
got
to
forty
and
yet
there
was
a
man
who
calls
himself
a
statesman
to
say
that
that
mere
puff
of
a
rise
satisfied
him
that
the
had
never
had
any
effect
ah
they
are
all
to
believe
in
the
effect
of
those
they
tremble
like
children
at
the
sight
of
the
rod
when
you
hold
up
before
them
the
effect
of
those
their
only
hope
is
that
i
am
wrong
in
my
opinions
upon
that
subject
because
if
i
am
right
their
system
is
condemned
to
speedy
destruction
i
thus
conclude
for
the
present
my
remarks
relative
to
the
harvest
and
the
price
of
corn
it
is
the
great
subject
of
the
day
and
the
comfort
is
that
we
are
now
speedily
to
see
whether
i
be
right
or
whether
the
marquis
of
lansdowne
be
right
as
to
the
infamous
london
press
the
moment
the
wheat
comes
down
to
forty
shillings
that
is
to
say
an
average
government
return
of
forty
shillings
i
will
spend
ten
pounds
in
placarding
this
infamous
press
after
the
manner
in
which
we
used
to
placard
the
base
and
detestable
enemies
of
the
queen
this
infamous
press
has
been
what
is
vulgarly
called
running
its
rigs
for
several
months
past
the
have
been
urging
it
on
they
have
i
understand
been
bribing
it
pretty
deeply
in
order
to
calumniate
me
and
to
favour
their
own
monopoly
but
thank
god
the
cunning
knaves
have
outwitted
themselves
they
wo
play
at
cards
but
they
will
play
at
they
will
play
at
lottery
tickets
and
they
will
play
at
they
have
played
a
silly
game
this
time
saint
swithin
that
good
old
roman
catholic
saint
seemed
to
have
set
a
trap
for
them
he
went
on
wet
wet
wet
even
until
the
harvest
began
then
after
two
or
three
days
sunshine
shocking
wet
again
the
ground
soaking
the
wheat
growing
and
the
the
gentle
friends
seeking
the
spirit
were
as
busy
amongst
the
sacks
at
as
the
devil
in
a
high
wind
in
short
they
bought
away
with
all
the
gain
of
godliness
a
little
before
their
eyes
all
of
a
sudden
saint
swithin
took
away
his
clouds
out
came
the
sun
the
wind
got
round
to
the
east
just
sun
enough
and
just
wind
enough
and
as
the
wheat
ricks
everywhere
rose
up
the
long
jaws
of
the
quakers
dropped
down
and
their
faces
of
slate
became
of
a
darker
hue
that
sect
will
certainly
be
punished
this
year
and
let
us
hope
that
such
a
change
will
take
place
in
their
concerns
as
will
compel
a
part
of
them
to
labour
at
any
rate
for
at
present
their
sect
is
a
perfect
monster
in
society
a
whole
sect
not
one
man
of
whom
earns
his
living
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
a
sect
a
great
deal
worse
than
the
jews
for
some
of
them
do
work
however
god
send
us
the
easterly
wind
for
another
fortnight
and
we
shall
certainly
see
some
of
this
sect
at
work
rural
ride
from
kensington
across
surrey
and
along
that
county
wednesday
evening
october
having
some
business
at
hartswood
near
reigate
i
intended
to
come
off
this
morning
on
horseback
along
with
my
son
richard
but
it
rained
so
furiously
the
last
night
that
we
gave
up
the
horse
project
for
being
by
appointment
to
be
at
reigate
by
ten
so
that
we
came
off
this
morning
at
five
in
a
intending
to
return
home
and
take
our
horses
finding
however
that
we
can
not
quit
this
place
till
friday
we
have
now
sent
for
our
horses
though
the
weather
is
dreadfully
wet
but
we
are
under
a
farmhouse
roof
and
the
wind
may
whistle
and
the
rain
fall
as
much
as
they
like
thursday
evening
having
done
my
business
at
hartswood
about
eleven
i
went
to
a
sale
at
a
farm
which
the
farmer
is
quitting
here
i
had
a
view
of
what
has
long
been
going
on
all
over
the
country
the
farm
which
belongs
to
has
been
held
by
a
man
of
the
name
of
charington
in
whose
family
the
lease
has
been
i
hear
a
great
number
of
years
the
house
is
hidden
by
trees
it
stands
in
the
weald
of
surrey
close
by
the
which
is
here
a
mere
rivulet
though
just
below
this
house
the
rivulet
supplies
the
very
prettiest
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
everything
about
this
farmhouse
was
formerly
the
scene
of
and
oak
oak
bedsteads
oak
chests
of
drawers
and
oak
tables
to
eat
on
long
strong
and
well
supplied
with
joint
stools
some
of
the
things
were
many
hundreds
of
years
old
but
all
appeared
to
be
in
a
state
of
decay
and
nearly
of
there
appeared
to
have
been
hardly
any
in
that
house
where
formerly
there
were
in
all
probability
from
ten
to
fifteen
men
boys
and
maids
and
which
was
the
worst
of
all
there
was
a
aye
and
a
and
too
one
end
of
the
front
of
this
once
plain
and
substantial
house
had
been
moulded
into
a
and
there
was
the
mahogany
table
and
the
fine
chairs
and
the
fine
glass
and
all
as
upstart
as
any
in
the
kingdom
can
boast
of
and
there
were
the
decanters
the
glasses
the
of
and
all
just
in
the
true
style
and
i
dare
say
it
has
been
charington
and
the
charington
and
not
plain
master
charington
and
his
son
hodge
and
his
daughter
betty
charington
all
of
whom
this
accursed
system
has
in
all
likelihood
transmuted
into
a
species
of
mock
gentlefolks
while
it
has
ground
the
labourers
down
into
real
slaves
why
do
not
farmers
now
and
their
as
they
did
formerly
because
they
can
not
keep
them
so
as
they
give
them
in
wages
this
is
the
real
cause
of
the
change
there
needs
no
more
to
prove
that
the
lot
of
the
working
classes
has
become
worse
than
it
formerly
was
this
fact
alone
is
quite
sufficient
to
settle
this
point
all
the
world
knows
that
a
number
of
people
boarded
in
the
same
house
and
at
the
same
table
can
with
as
good
food
be
boarded
much
cheaper
than
those
persons
divided
into
twos
threes
or
fours
can
be
boarded
this
is
a
truth
therefore
if
the
farmer
now
shuts
his
pantry
against
his
labourers
and
pays
them
wholly
in
money
is
it
not
clear
that
he
does
it
because
he
thereby
gives
them
a
living
to
him
that
is
to
say
a
living
than
formerly
mind
he
has
for
them
a
kitchen
for
them
to
sit
in
bed
rooms
for
them
to
sleep
in
tables
and
stools
and
benches
of
everlasting
duration
all
these
he
has
all
these
him
and
yet
so
much
does
he
gain
by
pinching
them
in
wages
that
he
lets
all
these
things
remain
as
of
no
use
rather
than
feed
labourers
in
the
house
judge
then
of
the
that
has
taken
place
in
the
condition
of
these
labourers
and
be
astonished
if
you
can
at
the
and
the
that
now
disgrace
this
once
happy
and
moral
england
the
land
produces
on
an
average
what
it
always
produced
but
there
is
a
new
distribution
of
the
produce
this
charington
father
used
i
dare
say
to
sit
at
the
head
of
the
along
with
his
men
say
grace
to
them
and
cut
up
the
meat
and
the
pudding
he
might
take
a
cup
of
to
himself
when
they
had
none
but
that
was
pretty
nearly
all
the
difference
in
their
manner
of
living
so
that
lived
well
but
the
had
many
and
and
a
and
a
and
and
these
evidently
imply
carryings
on
and
a
consumption
that
must
of
necessity
have
greatly
robbed
the
long
oak
table
if
it
had
remained
fully
tenanted
that
long
table
could
not
share
in
the
work
of
the
decanters
and
the
dinner
set
therefore
it
became
almost
untenanted
the
labourers
retreated
to
hovels
called
cottages
and
instead
of
board
and
lodging
they
got
money
so
little
of
it
as
to
enable
the
employer
to
drink
wine
but
then
that
he
might
not
reduce
them
to
they
were
enabled
to
come
to
him
in
the
and
demand
food
and
now
mind
that
which
a
man
receives
in
the
he
knows
well
he
has
and
it
is
not
in
nature
that
he
should
anybody
for
it
and
least
of
all
the
party
whom
it
is
then
if
this
sort
of
force
be
insufficient
to
obtain
him
enough
to
eat
and
to
keep
him
warm
is
it
surprising
if
he
think
it
no
great
offence
against
god
who
created
no
man
to
starve
to
use
another
sort
of
force
more
within
his
own
control
is
it
in
short
surprising
if
he
resort
to
and
this
is
not
only
the
progress
but
it
the
progress
in
england
the
blame
is
not
justly
imputed
to
charington
and
his
like
the
blame
belongs
to
the
infernal
system
there
was
no
reason
to
expect
that
farmers
would
not
endeavour
to
keep
pace
in
point
of
show
and
luxury
with
and
with
all
the
tribes
that
and
created
farmers
were
not
the
authors
of
the
mischief
and
they
are
compelled
to
shut
the
labourers
out
of
their
houses
and
to
pinch
them
in
their
wages
in
order
to
be
able
to
pay
their
own
taxes
and
besides
this
the
manners
and
the
principles
of
the
working
class
are
so
changed
that
a
sort
of
bids
the
farmer
especially
in
some
counties
to
keep
them
from
beneath
his
roof
i
could
not
quit
this
farmhouse
without
reflecting
on
the
thousands
of
scores
of
bacon
and
thousands
of
bushels
of
bread
that
had
been
eaten
from
the
long
which
i
said
to
myself
is
now
perhaps
going
at
last
to
the
bottom
of
a
bridge
that
some
will
stick
up
over
an
artificial
river
in
his
cockney
garden
it
said
i
almost
in
a
real
passion
and
so
i
requested
a
friend
to
buy
it
for
me
and
if
he
do
so
i
will
take
it
to
kensington
or
to
and
keep
it
for
the
good
it
has
done
in
the
world
when
the
old
farmhouses
are
down
and
down
they
must
come
in
time
what
a
miserable
thing
the
country
will
be
those
that
are
now
erected
are
mere
painted
shells
with
a
mistress
within
who
is
stuck
up
in
a
place
she
calls
a
with
if
she
have
children
the
young
ladies
and
gentlemen
about
her
some
showy
chairs
and
a
sofa
a
by
all
means
half
a
dozen
prints
in
gilt
frames
hanging
up
some
swinging
with
novels
and
tracts
upon
them
a
dinner
brought
in
by
a
girl
that
is
perhaps
better
educated
than
she
two
or
three
to
eat
instead
of
a
piece
of
bacon
and
a
pudding
the
house
too
neat
for
a
carter
to
be
allowed
to
come
into
and
everything
proclaiming
to
every
sensible
beholder
that
there
is
here
a
constant
anxiety
to
make
a
not
warranted
by
the
reality
the
children
which
is
the
worst
part
of
it
are
all
too
clever
to
they
are
all
to
be
go
to
plough
good
god
what
young
gentlemen
go
to
plough
they
become
or
some
thing
or
other
they
flee
from
the
dirty
as
cunning
horses
do
from
the
bridle
what
misery
is
all
this
what
a
mass
of
materials
for
producing
that
general
and
that
must
first
or
last
come
and
blow
this
funding
and
jobbing
and
enslaving
and
starving
system
to
atoms
i
was
going
by
the
side
of
a
plat
of
ground
where
there
was
a
very
fine
flock
of
i
stopped
to
admire
them
and
observed
to
the
owner
how
fine
they
were
when
he
answered
we
owe
them
entirely
sir
for
we
never
raised
one
till
we
read
your
i
then
told
him
that
we
had
this
year
raised
two
broods
at
kensington
one
black
and
one
white
one
of
nine
and
one
of
eight
but
that
about
three
weeks
back
they
appeared
to
become
dull
and
pale
about
the
head
and
that
therefore
i
sent
them
to
a
farmhouse
where
they
recovered
instantly
and
the
broods
being
such
a
contrast
to
each
other
in
point
of
colour
they
were
now
when
prowling
over
a
grass
field
amongst
the
most
agreeable
sights
that
i
had
ever
seen
i
intended
of
course
to
let
them
get
their
full
growth
at
kensington
where
they
were
in
a
grass
plat
about
fifteen
yards
square
and
where
i
thought
that
the
feeding
of
them
in
great
abundance
with
lettuces
and
other
greens
from
the
garden
together
with
grain
would
carry
them
on
to
perfection
but
i
found
that
i
was
wrong
and
that
though
you
may
raise
them
to
a
certain
size
in
a
small
place
and
with
such
management
they
then
if
so
much
confined
begin
to
be
sickly
several
of
mine
began
actually
to
droop
and
the
very
day
they
were
sent
into
the
country
they
became
as
gay
as
ever
and
in
three
days
all
the
colour
about
their
heads
came
back
to
them
this
town
of
reigate
had
in
former
times
a
priory
which
had
considerable
estates
in
the
neighbourhood
and
this
is
brought
to
my
recollection
by
a
circumstance
which
has
recently
taken
place
in
this
very
town
we
all
know
how
long
it
has
been
the
fashion
for
us
to
take
it
for
that
the
monasteries
were
but
of
late
i
have
made
some
hundreds
of
thousands
of
very
good
protestants
begin
to
suspect
that
monasteries
were
better
than
and
that
monks
and
nuns
who
the
were
better
than
sinecure
and
pension
men
and
women
who
upon
the
but
how
came
the
monasteries
how
came
this
that
was
at
reigate
for
instance
why
it
was
if
i
recollect
correctly
by
a
surrey
who
gave
this
spot
and
other
estates
to
it
and
who
as
was
usual
provided
that
masses
were
to
be
said
in
it
for
his
soul
and
those
of
others
and
that
it
should
as
usual
give
aid
to
the
poor
and
needy
now
upon
the
face
of
the
transaction
what
could
this
do
the
community
on
the
contrary
it
must
one
would
think
do
it
for
here
was
this
estate
given
to
a
set
of
landlords
who
never
could
quit
the
spot
who
could
have
no
families
who
could
save
no
money
who
could
hold
no
private
property
who
could
make
no
will
who
must
spend
all
their
income
at
reigate
and
near
it
who
as
was
the
custom
fed
the
poor
administered
to
the
sick
and
taught
some
at
least
of
the
people
this
upon
the
face
of
the
thing
seems
to
be
a
very
good
way
of
disposing
of
a
rich
man
estate
aye
but
it
is
said
he
left
his
estate
away
from
his
relations
that
is
not
by
any
means
the
contrary
is
fairly
to
be
presumed
doubtless
it
was
the
custom
for
catholic
priests
before
they
took
their
leave
of
a
dying
rich
man
to
advise
him
to
think
of
the
and
the
that
is
to
say
to
exhort
him
to
bequeath
something
to
them
and
this
has
been
made
a
monstrous
charge
against
that
church
it
is
surprising
how
blind
men
are
when
they
have
a
mind
to
be
blind
what
despicable
dolts
they
are
when
they
desire
to
be
cheated
we
of
the
church
of
england
must
have
a
special
deal
of
good
sense
and
of
modesty
to
be
sure
to
rail
against
the
catholic
church
on
this
account
when
our
common
prayer
book
copied
from
an
act
of
parliament
our
parsons
to
do
just
the
same
ah
say
the
dissenters
and
particularly
the
unitarians
that
queer
sect
who
will
have
all
the
wisdom
in
the
world
to
themselves
who
will
believe
and
wo
believe
who
will
be
christians
and
who
wo
have
a
who
will
laugh
at
you
if
you
believe
in
the
trinity
and
who
would
if
they
could
boil
you
in
oil
if
you
do
not
believe
in
the
resurrection
oh
say
the
dissenters
we
know
very
well
that
your
are
commanded
to
get
if
they
can
dying
people
to
give
their
money
and
estates
to
the
church
and
as
they
call
the
concern
though
the
we
believe
come
in
for
very
little
which
is
got
in
this
way
but
what
is
we
are
the
real
christians
and
we
upon
our
souls
never
play
such
tricks
never
no
never
terrify
old
women
out
of
their
stockings
full
of
guineas
and
as
to
us
say
the
unitarians
we
the
most
creatures
upon
earth
we
whose
virtue
is
indignant
at
the
tricks
by
which
the
monks
and
nuns
got
legacies
from
dying
people
to
the
injury
of
heirs
and
other
relations
we
who
are
the
really
enlightened
the
truly
consistent
the
benevolent
the
disinterested
the
exclusive
patentees
of
the
of
the
which
is
sold
only
at
or
by
express
permission
from
our
old
and
original
warehouse
and
manufactory
in
the
strand
first
street
on
the
left
going
from
temple
bar
towards
charing
cross
we
defy
you
to
show
that
unitarian
parsons
stop
your
protestations
and
hear
my
reigate
anecdote
which
as
i
said
above
brought
the
recollection
of
the
old
priory
into
my
head
the
readers
of
the
register
heard
me
several
times
some
years
ago
mention
baron
maseres
who
was
for
a
great
many
years
what
they
call
cursitor
baron
of
the
exchequer
he
lived
partly
in
london
and
partly
at
reigate
for
more
i
believe
than
half
a
century
and
he
died
about
two
years
ago
or
less
leaving
i
am
told
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
the
baron
came
to
see
me
in
pall
mall
in
he
always
came
frequently
to
see
me
wherever
i
was
in
london
not
by
any
means
omitting
to
to
see
me
in
where
i
was
imprisoned
for
two
years
with
a
thousand
pounds
fine
and
seven
years
heavy
bail
for
having
expressed
my
indignation
at
the
flogging
of
englishmen
in
the
heart
of
england
under
a
guard
of
german
bayonets
and
to
newgate
he
always
came
in
wig
and
in
order
as
he
said
to
show
his
abhorrence
of
the
sentence
i
several
times
passed
a
week
or
more
with
the
baron
at
his
house
at
reigate
and
might
have
passed
many
more
if
my
time
and
taste
would
have
permitted
me
to
accept
of
his
invitations
therefore
i
knew
the
baron
well
he
was
a
most
conscientious
man
he
was
when
i
first
knew
him
still
a
very
clever
man
he
retained
all
his
faculties
to
a
very
great
age
in
i
think
it
was
i
got
a
letter
from
him
written
in
a
firm
hand
correctly
as
to
grammar
and
ably
as
to
matter
and
he
must
then
have
been
little
short
of
ninety
he
never
was
a
bright
man
but
had
always
been
a
very
sensible
just
and
humane
man
and
a
man
too
who
always
cared
a
great
deal
for
the
public
good
and
he
was
the
only
man
that
i
ever
heard
of
who
refused
to
have
his
salary
augmented
when
an
augmentation
was
offered
and
when
all
other
such
salaries
were
augmented
i
had
heard
of
this
i
asked
him
about
it
when
i
saw
him
again
and
he
said
there
was
no
to
be
added
and
i
saw
no
justice
in
adding
to
the
salary
it
must
added
he
be
by
and
the
more
i
take
the
less
that
somebody
must
have
he
did
not
save
money
for
money
sake
he
saved
it
because
his
habits
would
not
let
him
spend
it
he
kept
a
house
in
rathbone
place
chambers
in
the
temple
and
his
very
pretty
place
at
reigate
he
was
by
no
means
stingy
but
his
scale
and
habits
were
cheap
then
consider
too
a
bachelor
of
nearly
a
hundred
years
old
his
father
left
him
a
fortune
his
brother
who
also
died
a
very
old
bachelor
left
him
another
and
the
money
lay
in
the
funds
and
it
went
on
doubling
itself
over
and
over
again
till
it
became
that
immense
mass
which
we
have
seen
above
and
which
when
the
baron
was
making
his
will
he
had
neither
catholic
priest
nor
protestant
parson
to
exhort
him
to
leave
to
the
church
and
the
poor
instead
of
his
relations
though
as
we
shall
presently
see
he
had
somebody
else
to
whom
to
leave
his
great
heap
of
money
the
baron
was
a
most
implacable
enemy
of
the
catholics
as
catholics
there
was
rather
a
peculiar
reason
for
this
his
having
been
a
and
having
fled
with
his
children
to
england
at
the
time
of
the
revocation
of
the
edict
of
nantz
the
baron
was
a
very
humane
man
his
humanity
made
him
assist
to
support
the
french
emigrant
priests
but
at
the
same
time
he
caused
sir
richard
musgrave
book
against
the
irish
catholics
to
be
published
at
his
own
expense
he
and
i
never
agreed
upon
this
subject
and
this
subject
was
with
him
a
one
he
had
no
asperity
in
his
nature
he
was
naturally
all
gentleness
and
benevolence
and
therefore
he
never
what
i
said
to
him
on
this
subject
and
which
nobody
else
ever
i
believe
ventured
to
say
to
him
but
he
did
not
like
it
and
he
liked
it
less
because
i
certainly
beat
him
in
the
argument
however
this
was
long
before
he
visited
me
in
newgate
and
it
never
produced
though
the
dispute
was
frequently
revived
any
difference
in
his
conduct
towards
me
which
was
uniformly
friendly
to
the
last
time
i
saw
him
before
his
memory
was
gone
there
was
great
excuse
for
the
baron
from
his
very
birth
he
had
been
taught
to
hate
and
abhor
the
catholic
religion
he
had
been
told
that
his
father
and
mother
had
been
driven
out
of
france
by
the
catholics
and
there
was
dinning
this
in
his
ears
and
all
manner
of
horrible
stories
along
with
it
during
all
the
tender
years
of
his
life
in
short
the
prejudice
made
part
of
his
very
frame
in
the
year
in
august
i
think
it
was
i
had
gone
down
to
his
house
on
a
friday
and
was
there
on
a
sunday
after
dinner
he
and
i
and
his
brother
walked
to
the
priory
as
is
still
called
the
mansion
house
in
the
dell
at
reigate
which
is
now
occupied
by
lord
eastnor
and
in
which
a
birket
i
think
then
lived
after
coming
away
from
the
priory
the
baron
whose
native
place
was
betchworth
about
two
or
three
miles
from
reigate
who
knew
the
history
of
every
house
and
every
thing
else
in
this
part
of
the
country
began
to
tell
me
why
the
place
was
called
from
this
he
came
to
the
and
that
induced
people
to
found
monasteries
and
he
dwelt
particularly
on
the
to
heirs
and
and
he
went
on
in
the
usual
protestant
strain
and
with
all
the
bitterness
of
which
he
was
capable
against
those
who
thus
by
means
of
the
influence
which
they
had
over
people
in
their
dotage
or
who
were
naturally
alas
poor
baron
he
does
not
seem
to
have
at
all
foreseen
what
was
to
become
of
his
own
money
what
would
he
have
said
to
me
if
i
had
answered
his
observations
by
predicting
that
would
give
his
great
mass
of
money
to
a
little
parson
for
that
parson
own
private
use
leave
only
a
mere
pittance
to
his
own
relations
leave
the
little
parson
his
house
in
which
we
were
then
sitting
along
with
all
his
other
real
property
that
the
little
parson
would
come
into
the
house
and
take
possession
and
that
his
own
relations
two
nieces
would
walk
out
yet
all
this
has
actually
taken
place
and
that
too
after
the
poor
old
baron
four
score
years
of
jokes
about
the
tricks
of
priests
practised
in
the
upon
the
and
people
of
reigate
when
i
first
knew
the
baron
he
was
a
staunch
of
england
he
went
to
church
every
sunday
once
at
least
he
used
to
take
me
to
reigate
church
and
i
observed
that
he
was
very
well
versed
in
his
prayer
book
but
a
decisive
proof
of
his
zeal
as
a
church
of
england
man
is
that
he
settled
an
annual
sum
on
the
incumbent
of
reigate
in
order
to
induce
him
to
preach
or
pray
i
forget
which
in
the
church
twice
on
a
sunday
instead
of
once
and
in
case
this
additional
preaching
or
praying
were
not
performed
in
reigate
church
the
annuity
was
to
go
and
sometimes
it
does
now
go
to
the
poor
of
an
adjoining
parish
and
not
to
those
of
reigate
lest
i
suppose
the
parson
the
overseers
and
other
might
happen
to
think
that
the
baron
annuity
would
be
better
laid
out
in
food
for
the
bodies
than
for
the
souls
of
the
poor
or
in
other
words
lest
the
money
should
be
taken
annually
and
added
to
the
to
ease
the
purses
of
the
farmers
it
did
not
i
dare
say
occur
to
the
poor
baron
when
he
was
making
this
settlement
that
he
was
now
giving
money
to
make
a
church
parson
put
up
additional
prayers
though
he
had
all
his
lifetime
been
laughing
at
those
who
in
the
ages
gave
money
for
this
purpose
to
catholic
priests
nor
did
it
i
dare
say
occur
to
the
baron
that
in
his
contingent
settlement
of
the
annuity
on
the
poor
of
an
adjoining
parish
he
as
good
as
declared
his
opinion
that
he
distrusted
the
piety
of
the
parson
the
overseers
the
churchwardens
and
indeed
of
all
the
people
of
reigate
yes
at
the
very
moment
that
he
was
providing
additional
prayers
for
them
he
in
the
very
same
parchment
put
a
provision
which
clearly
showed
that
he
was
thoroughly
convinced
that
they
overseers
churchwardens
people
parson
and
all
loved
money
better
than
prayers
what
was
this
then
was
it
hypocrisy
was
it
ostentation
no
mistake
the
baron
thought
that
those
who
could
not
go
to
church
in
the
morning
ought
to
have
an
opportunity
of
going
in
the
afternoon
he
was
aware
of
the
power
of
money
but
when
he
came
to
make
his
obligatory
clause
he
was
compelled
to
do
that
which
reflected
great
discredit
on
the
very
church
and
religion
which
it
was
his
object
to
honour
and
uphold
however
the
baron
a
staunch
churchman
as
this
fact
clearly
proves
several
years
he
had
become
what
they
call
an
the
first
time
i
think
that
i
perceived
this
was
in
he
came
to
see
me
in
newgate
and
he
soon
began
to
talk
about
which
had
not
been
much
his
habit
he
went
on
at
a
great
rate
laughing
about
the
trinity
and
i
remember
that
he
repeated
the
unitarian
distich
which
makes
of
the
idea
of
there
being
a
devil
and
which
they
all
repeat
to
you
and
at
the
same
time
laugh
and
look
as
cunning
and
as
priggish
as
just
as
if
they
were
wiser
than
all
the
rest
of
the
world
i
hate
to
hear
the
conceited
and
disgusting
prigs
seeming
to
take
it
for
granted
that
they
only
are
wise
because
others
in
the
incarnation
without
being
able
to
reconcile
it
to
the
prigs
do
consider
that
there
is
no
more
for
the
than
for
the
and
yet
having
taken
it
into
their
heads
to
up
they
would
murder
you
if
they
dared
if
you
were
to
deny
the
i
do
most
heartily
despise
this
priggish
set
for
their
conceit
and
impudence
but
seeing
that
they
want
for
the
incarnation
seeing
that
they
will
have
here
ascribed
to
none
but
let
me
put
a
question
or
two
to
them
comes
the
that
comes
up
and
covers
all
the
ground
in
america
where
trees
after
standing
for
thousands
of
years
have
been
burnt
down
come
in
similar
cases
as
to
the
hurtleberries
in
some
places
and
the
raspberries
in
others
come
fish
in
new
made
places
where
no
fish
have
ever
been
put
to
become
living
things
frogs
to
come
in
drops
of
rain
or
those
drops
of
rain
to
turn
to
frogs
the
moment
they
are
on
the
earth
musquitoes
to
come
in
rain
water
caught
in
a
glass
covered
over
immediately
with
oil
paper
tied
down
and
so
kept
till
full
of
these
winged
torments
flounders
real
little
brown
on
one
side
white
on
the
other
mouth
with
tail
fins
and
all
in
the
of
a
rotten
sheep
and
of
every
rotten
sheep
there
prigs
answer
these
questions
fifty
might
be
given
you
but
these
are
enough
answer
these
i
suppose
you
will
not
deny
the
facts
they
are
all
notoriously
true
the
which
of
itself
would
be
quite
enough
for
you
will
be
attested
on
oath
if
you
like
it
by
any
farmer
ploughman
and
shepherd
in
england
answer
this
question
or
hold
your
conceited
gabble
about
the
of
that
which
i
need
not
here
name
men
of
sense
do
not
attempt
to
discover
that
which
it
is
to
discover
they
leave
things
pretty
much
as
they
find
them
and
take
care
at
least
not
to
make
changes
of
any
sort
without
very
evident
necessity
the
poor
baron
however
appeared
to
be
quite
eaten
up
with
his
christianity
he
talked
like
a
man
who
has
made
a
of
his
he
seemed
as
pleased
as
i
when
i
was
a
boy
used
to
be
when
i
had
just
found
a
rabbit
stop
or
a
nest
full
of
young
ones
i
do
not
recollect
what
i
said
upon
this
occasion
it
is
most
likely
that
i
said
nothing
in
contradiction
to
him
i
saw
the
baron
many
times
after
this
but
i
never
talked
with
him
about
religion
before
the
summer
of
i
had
not
seen
him
for
a
year
or
two
perhaps
but
in
july
of
that
year
on
a
very
hot
day
i
was
going
down
rathbone
place
and
happening
to
cast
my
eye
on
the
baron
house
i
knocked
at
the
door
to
ask
how
he
was
his
man
servant
came
to
the
door
and
told
me
that
his
master
was
at
dinner
well
said
i
never
mind
give
my
best
respects
to
him
but
the
servant
who
had
always
been
with
him
since
i
knew
him
begged
me
to
come
in
for
that
he
was
sure
his
master
would
be
glad
to
see
me
i
thought
as
it
was
likely
that
i
might
never
see
him
again
i
would
go
in
the
servant
announced
me
and
the
baron
said
beg
him
to
walk
in
in
i
went
and
there
i
found
the
baron
at
dinner
but
quite
nor
without
as
well
as
carnal
and
vegetable
nourishment
before
him
for
there
on
the
opposite
side
of
his
dining
table
sat
that
nice
neat
straight
prim
piece
of
mortality
commonly
called
the
reverend
robert
fellowes
who
was
the
chaplain
to
the
unfortunate
queen
until
alderman
son
came
to
supply
his
place
and
who
was
now
i
could
clearly
see
in
a
fair
way
enough
i
had
dined
and
so
i
let
them
dine
on
the
baron
was
become
quite
a
child
or
worse
as
to
mind
though
he
ate
as
heartily
as
i
ever
saw
him
and
he
was
always
a
great
eater
when
his
servant
said
here
is
cobbett
sir
he
said
how
do
you
do
sir
i
have
read
much
of
your
writings
sir
but
had
the
pleasure
to
see
your
person
after
a
time
i
made
him
recollect
me
but
he
directly
after
being
about
to
relate
something
about
america
turned
towards
me
and
said
you
ever
in
sir
but
i
must
mention
one
proof
of
the
state
of
his
mind
fellowes
asked
me
about
the
news
from
ireland
where
the
people
were
then
in
a
state
of
starvation
and
i
answering
that
it
was
likely
that
many
of
them
would
actually
be
starved
to
death
the
baron
quitting
his
green
goose
and
green
pease
turned
to
me
and
said
sir
why
do
they
go
to
why
said
i
you
know
sir
that
there
are
no
in
ireland
upon
this
he
exclaimed
what
no
in
ireland
why
not
i
did
not
know
that
i
ca
think
how
that
can
be
and
then
he
rambled
on
in
a
childish
sort
of
way
at
the
end
of
about
half
an
hour
or
it
might
be
more
i
shook
hands
with
the
poor
old
baron
for
the
last
time
well
convinced
that
i
should
never
see
him
again
and
not
less
convinced
that
i
had
seen
his
he
died
in
about
a
year
or
so
afterwards
left
to
his
own
family
about
and
to
his
ghostly
guide
the
holy
robert
fellowes
all
the
rest
of
his
immense
fortune
which
as
i
have
been
told
amounts
to
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
money
now
the
public
will
recollect
that
while
fellowes
was
at
the
queen
he
was
in
the
public
papers
charged
with
being
an
at
the
same
time
that
he
officiated
her
it
is
also
well
known
that
he
never
publicly
contradicted
this
it
is
besides
the
general
belief
at
reigate
however
this
we
know
well
that
he
is
a
parson
of
one
sort
or
the
other
and
that
he
is
not
a
catholic
priest
that
is
enough
for
me
i
see
this
poor
foolish
old
man
leaving
a
monstrous
mass
of
money
to
this
little
protestant
parson
whom
he
had
not
even
known
more
i
believe
than
about
three
or
four
years
when
the
will
was
made
i
can
not
say
i
know
nothing
at
all
about
that
i
am
supposing
that
all
was
perfectly
fair
that
the
baron
had
his
senses
when
he
made
his
will
that
he
clearly
meant
to
do
that
which
he
did
but
then
i
must
insist
that
if
he
had
left
the
money
to
a
to
be
by
him
expended
on
the
endowment
of
a
convent
wherein
to
say
masses
and
to
feed
and
teach
the
poor
it
would
have
been
a
more
sensible
and
part
in
the
baron
much
more
beneficial
to
the
town
and
environs
of
reigate
and
beyond
all
measure
more
honourable
to
his
own
memory
friday
evening
it
has
been
very
fine
yesterday
morning
there
was
on
reigate
hill
enough
to
look
white
from
where
we
were
in
the
valley
we
set
off
about
one
and
came
all
down
the
valley
through
buckland
betchworth
dorking
sheer
and
aldbury
to
this
place
very
few
prettier
rides
in
england
and
the
weather
beautifully
fine
there
are
more
than
churches
in
the
vale
and
i
have
heard
of
no
less
than
five
people
in
this
vale
who
have
gone
crazy
on
account
of
religion
we
intend
to
move
on
towards
the
west
to
take
a
look
just
a
look
at
the
hampshire
parsons
again
the
turnips
seem
fine
but
they
can
not
be
large
all
other
things
are
very
fine
indeed
everything
seems
to
prognosticate
a
hard
winter
all
the
country
people
say
that
it
will
be
so
ride
from
chilworth
in
surrey
to
winchester
four
miles
from
godalming
surrey
sunday
evening
october
we
set
out
from
chilworth
about
noon
this
is
a
little
hamlet
lying
under
the
south
side
of
martha
hill
and
on
the
other
side
of
that
hill
a
little
to
the
north
west
is
the
town
of
guilford
which
taken
with
its
environs
i
who
have
seen
so
many
many
towns
think
the
prettiest
and
taken
all
together
the
most
agreeable
and
most
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
here
are
hill
and
dell
in
endless
variety
here
are
the
chalk
and
the
sand
vieing
with
each
other
in
making
beautiful
scenes
here
is
a
navigable
river
and
fine
meadows
here
are
woods
and
downs
here
is
something
of
everything
but
and
their
the
vale
all
the
way
down
to
chilworth
from
reigate
is
very
delightful
we
did
not
go
to
guildford
nor
did
we
cross
the
to
come
through
godalming
but
bore
away
to
our
left
and
came
through
the
village
of
hambleton
going
first
to
hascomb
to
show
richard
the
south
downs
from
that
high
land
which
looks
southward
over
the
of
surrey
and
sussex
with
all
their
fine
and
innumerable
oak
trees
those
that
travel
on
turnpike
roads
know
nothing
of
from
hascomb
to
thursley
almost
the
whole
way
is
across
fields
or
commons
or
along
narrow
lands
here
we
see
the
people
without
any
disguise
or
affectation
against
a
things
are
made
for
here
we
see
them
any
and
here
we
gain
real
knowledge
as
to
their
we
crossed
three
turnpike
roads
that
from
guildford
to
horsham
that
from
godalming
to
worthing
i
believe
and
that
from
godalming
to
chichester
wednesday
the
weather
has
been
beautiful
ever
since
last
thursday
morning
but
there
has
been
a
white
frost
every
morning
and
the
days
have
been
coldish
however
i
am
quite
at
home
in
a
room
where
there
is
one
of
my
fire
bought
by
my
host
of
judson
of
kensington
who
has
made
many
a
score
of
families
comfortable
instead
of
sitting
shivering
in
the
cold
at
the
house
of
the
gentleman
whose
house
i
am
now
in
there
is
a
good
deal
of
and
here
i
see
in
the
parlours
those
fine
and
cheerful
fires
that
make
a
great
part
of
the
happiness
of
the
americans
but
these
fires
are
to
be
had
only
in
this
sort
of
ten
times
the
fuel
nay
no
quantity
would
effect
the
same
object
in
any
other
it
is
equally
good
for
coal
as
for
wood
but
for
a
is
the
thing
there
is
round
about
almost
every
gentleman
or
great
farmer
house
more
wood
suffered
to
rot
every
year
in
one
shape
or
another
than
would
make
with
this
a
couple
of
rooms
constantly
warm
from
october
to
june
peat
turf
and
wood
are
burnt
in
these
my
present
host
has
three
of
the
being
out
i
saw
a
building
upon
one
of
the
thousands
of
hills
that
nature
has
tossed
up
in
endless
variety
of
form
round
the
skirts
of
the
lofty
hindhead
this
building
is
it
seems
called
a
or
or
something
of
that
sort
what
this
word
may
have
been
hatched
out
of
i
can
not
say
but
it
means
i
am
sure
to
call
it
an
would
not
have
been
so
convenient
for
people
not
endued
with
scotch
might
have
wondered
why
the
devil
we
should
have
to
pay
for
and
might
have
thought
that
with
all
our
glorious
victories
we
had
brought
our
hogs
to
a
fine
market
if
our
dread
of
the
enemy
were
such
as
to
induce
us
to
have
all
over
the
country
such
unintellectual
people
might
have
thought
that
we
had
conquered
france
by
the
immortal
wellington
to
little
purpose
if
we
were
still
in
such
fear
as
to
build
and
they
might
in
addition
have
observed
that
for
many
hundred
of
years
england
stood
in
need
of
neither
signal
posts
nor
standing
army
of
mercenaries
but
relied
safely
on
the
courage
and
public
spirit
of
the
people
themselves
by
calling
the
thing
by
an
outlandish
name
these
reflections
amongst
the
unintellectual
are
obviated
would
be
a
nasty
name
and
it
would
puzzle
people
exceedingly
when
they
saw
one
of
these
at
a
place
like
ashe
a
little
village
on
the
north
side
of
the
called
the
hog
back
going
from
guildford
to
farnham
what
can
this
be
why
are
these
expensive
things
put
up
all
over
the
country
respecting
the
movements
of
is
wanted
this
will
no
member
ask
this
in
parliament
not
one
not
a
man
and
yet
it
is
a
thing
to
ask
about
ah
it
is
in
vain
thing
that
you
thus
are
your
in
vain
that
you
are
setting
your
trammels
the
debt
the
blessed
debt
that
best
ally
of
the
people
will
break
them
all
will
snap
them
as
the
hornet
does
the
cobweb
and
even
these
very
semaphores
contribute
towards
the
force
of
that
debt
curious
to
see
how
things
the
glorious
revolution
which
was
made
for
the
avowed
purpose
of
maintaining
the
protestant
ascendancy
and
which
was
followed
by
such
terrible
persecution
of
the
catholics
that
glorious
affair
which
set
aside
a
race
of
kings
because
they
were
catholics
served
as
the
for
the
american
revolution
also
called
glorious
and
this
second
revolution
compelled
the
successors
of
the
makers
of
the
first
to
begin
to
cease
their
persecutions
of
the
catholics
then
again
the
debt
was
made
to
raise
and
keep
armies
on
foot
to
prevent
reform
of
parliament
because
as
it
was
feared
by
the
aristocracy
reform
would
have
humbled
them
and
this
debt
created
for
this
purpose
is
fast
sweeping
the
aristocracy
out
of
their
estates
as
a
clown
with
his
foot
kicks
out
of
their
nests
there
was
a
hope
that
the
debt
could
have
been
reduced
by
stealth
as
it
were
that
the
aristocracy
could
have
been
saved
in
this
way
that
hope
now
no
longer
exists
in
all
likelihood
the
funds
will
keep
going
down
what
is
to
prevent
this
if
the
interest
of
exchequer
bills
be
raised
as
the
broad
sheet
tells
us
it
is
to
be
what
the
funds
fall
in
time
of
peace
and
the
french
funds
not
fall
in
time
of
peace
however
it
will
all
happen
just
as
it
ought
to
happen
even
the
next
session
of
parliament
will
bring
out
matters
of
some
interest
the
thing
is
now
working
in
the
surest
possible
way
the
great
business
of
life
in
the
country
appertains
in
some
way
or
other
to
the
and
especially
at
this
time
of
the
year
if
it
were
not
for
the
game
a
country
life
would
be
like
an
which
would
in
about
half
a
century
put
an
end
to
the
human
race
in
towns
or
large
villages
people
make
a
shift
to
find
the
means
of
rubbing
the
rust
off
from
each
other
by
a
vast
variety
of
sources
of
contest
a
couple
of
wives
meeting
in
the
street
and
giving
each
other
a
wry
look
or
a
look
not
quite
civil
enough
will
if
the
parties
be
hard
pushed
for
a
ground
of
contention
do
pretty
well
but
in
the
country
there
is
alas
no
such
resource
here
are
no
walls
for
people
to
take
of
each
other
here
they
are
so
placed
as
to
prevent
the
possibility
of
such
lucky
local
contact
here
is
more
than
room
of
every
sort
elbow
leg
horse
or
carriage
for
them
all
even
most
of
the
people
being
in
the
the
pews
are
surprisingly
too
large
here
therefore
where
all
circumstances
seem
calculated
to
cause
concord
with
its
accompanying
dullness
there
would
be
no
relief
at
all
were
it
not
for
the
this
happily
supplies
the
place
of
all
other
sources
of
alternate
dispute
and
reconciliation
it
keeps
all
in
life
and
motion
from
the
lord
down
to
the
hedger
when
i
see
two
men
whether
in
a
by
the
in
a
parlour
in
a
or
even
in
the
church
itself
engaged
in
manifestly
deep
and
most
momentous
discourse
i
will
if
it
be
any
time
between
september
and
february
bet
ten
to
one
that
it
is
in
some
way
or
other
about
the
wives
and
daughters
hear
so
much
of
it
that
they
inevitably
get
engaged
in
the
disputes
and
thus
all
are
kept
in
a
state
of
vivid
animation
i
should
like
very
much
to
be
able
to
take
a
spot
a
circle
of
miles
in
diameter
and
take
an
exact
account
of
all
the
spent
by
each
individual
above
the
age
of
ten
that
is
the
age
they
begin
at
in
talking
during
the
game
season
of
one
year
about
the
game
and
about
sporting
exploits
i
verily
believe
that
it
would
amount
upon
an
average
to
six
times
as
much
as
all
the
other
talk
put
together
and
as
to
the
anger
the
satisfaction
the
scolding
the
commendation
the
chagrin
the
exultation
the
envy
the
emulation
where
are
there
any
of
these
in
the
country
unconnected
with
there
is
however
an
important
distinction
to
be
made
between
including
coursers
and
the
latter
are
as
far
as
relates
to
their
exploits
a
disagreeable
class
compared
with
the
former
and
the
reason
of
this
is
their
doings
are
almost
wholly
their
own
while
in
the
case
of
the
others
the
achievements
are
the
property
of
the
dogs
nobody
likes
to
hear
another
talk
in
praise
of
his
own
acts
unless
those
acts
have
a
manifest
tendency
to
produce
some
good
to
the
hearer
and
shooters
do
talk
of
their
own
exploits
and
those
exploits
rather
tend
to
the
hearer
then
a
will
nine
times
out
of
ten
go
so
far
as
almost
to
a
and
though
people
do
not
tell
him
of
it
they
do
not
like
him
the
better
for
it
and
he
but
too
frequently
discovers
that
they
do
not
believe
him
whereas
hunters
are
mere
followers
of
the
dogs
as
mere
spectators
their
praises
if
any
are
called
for
are
bestowed
on
the
greyhounds
the
hounds
the
fox
the
hare
or
the
horses
there
is
a
little
rivalship
in
the
riding
or
in
the
behaviour
of
the
horses
but
this
has
so
little
to
do
with
the
personal
merit
of
the
sportsmen
that
it
never
produces
a
want
of
good
fellowship
in
the
evening
of
the
day
a
shooter
who
has
been
all
day
must
have
an
uncommon
share
of
good
sense
not
to
feel
mortified
while
the
slaughterers
are
relating
the
adventures
of
that
day
and
this
is
what
can
not
exist
in
the
case
of
the
hunters
bring
me
into
a
room
with
a
dozen
men
in
it
who
have
been
sporting
all
day
or
rather
let
me
be
in
an
adjoining
room
where
i
can
hear
the
sound
of
their
voices
without
being
able
to
distinguish
the
words
and
i
will
bet
ten
to
one
that
i
tell
whether
they
be
hunters
or
shooters
i
was
once
acquainted
with
a
whose
name
was
william
ewing
he
was
a
barrister
of
philadelphia
but
became
far
more
renowned
by
his
gun
than
by
his
law
cases
we
spent
scores
of
days
together
and
were
extremely
well
matched
i
having
excellent
dogs
and
caring
little
about
my
reputation
as
a
shot
his
dogs
being
good
for
nothing
and
he
caring
more
about
his
reputation
as
a
shot
than
as
a
lawyer
the
fact
which
i
am
going
to
relate
respecting
this
gentleman
ought
to
be
a
warning
to
young
men
how
they
become
enamoured
of
this
species
of
vanity
we
had
gone
about
ten
miles
from
our
home
to
shoot
where
partridges
were
said
to
be
very
plentiful
we
found
them
so
in
the
course
of
a
november
day
he
had
just
before
dark
shot
and
sent
to
the
farmhouse
or
kept
in
his
bag
partridges
he
made
some
few
and
he
might
have
a
or
two
for
he
sometimes
shot
when
out
of
my
sight
on
account
of
the
woods
however
he
said
that
he
killed
at
every
shot
and
as
he
had
counted
the
birds
when
we
went
to
dinner
at
the
farmhouse
and
when
he
cleaned
his
gun
he
just
before
knew
that
he
had
killed
partridges
every
one
upon
the
wing
and
a
great
part
of
them
in
woods
very
thickly
set
with
largish
trees
it
was
a
grand
achievement
but
unfortunately
he
wanted
to
make
it
the
sun
was
setting
and
in
that
country
darkness
comes
almost
at
once
it
is
more
like
the
going
out
of
a
candle
than
that
of
a
fire
and
i
wanted
to
be
off
as
we
had
a
very
bad
road
to
go
and
as
he
being
under
strict
petticoat
government
to
which
he
most
loyally
and
dutifully
submitted
was
compelled
to
get
home
that
night
taking
me
with
him
the
vehicle
horse
and
gig
being
mine
i
therefore
pressed
him
to
come
away
and
moved
on
myself
towards
the
house
that
of
old
john
brown
in
bucks
county
grandfather
of
that
general
brown
who
gave
some
of
our
whiskered
heroes
such
a
rough
handling
last
war
which
was
waged
for
the
purpose
of
deposing
james
madison
at
which
house
i
would
have
stayed
all
night
but
from
which
i
was
compelled
to
go
by
that
watchful
government
under
which
he
had
the
good
fortune
to
live
therefore
i
was
in
haste
to
be
off
no
he
would
kill
the
bird
in
vain
did
i
talk
of
the
bad
road
and
its
many
dangers
for
want
of
moon
the
poor
partridges
which
we
had
scattered
about
were
all
around
us
and
just
at
this
moment
up
got
one
under
his
feet
in
a
field
in
which
the
wheat
was
three
or
four
inches
high
he
shot
and
that
it
said
he
running
as
if
to
the
bird
what
said
i
you
do
think
you
do
you
why
there
is
the
bird
now
not
only
alive
but
in
that
wood
which
was
at
about
a
hundred
yards
distance
he
in
that
of
usually
employed
in
such
cases
asserted
that
he
shot
the
bird
and
saw
it
fall
and
i
in
much
about
the
same
form
of
words
asserted
that
he
had
and
that
i
with
my
own
eyes
saw
the
bird
fly
into
the
wood
this
was
too
much
to
once
out
of
a
hundred
times
to
lose
such
a
chance
of
immortality
he
was
a
man
i
liked
him
very
much
and
i
could
not
help
feeling
for
him
when
he
said
well
i
killed
the
bird
and
if
you
choose
to
go
away
and
take
your
dog
away
so
as
to
prevent
me
from
it
you
must
do
it
the
dog
is
to
be
sure
the
said
i
in
a
very
mild
tone
why
ewing
there
is
the
spot
and
could
we
not
see
it
upon
this
smooth
green
surface
if
it
were
there
however
he
began
to
and
i
called
the
dog
and
affected
to
join
him
in
the
search
pity
for
his
weakness
got
the
better
of
my
dread
of
the
bad
road
after
walking
backward
and
forward
many
times
upon
about
twenty
yards
square
with
our
eyes
to
the
ground
looking
for
what
both
of
us
knew
was
not
there
i
had
passed
him
he
going
one
way
and
i
the
other
and
i
happened
to
be
turning
round
just
after
i
had
passed
him
when
i
saw
him
putting
his
hand
behind
him
a
partridge
out
of
his
bag
and
let
it
fall
upon
the
i
felt
no
temptation
to
detect
him
but
turned
away
my
head
and
kept
looking
about
presently
he
having
returned
to
the
spot
where
the
bird
was
called
out
to
me
in
a
most
triumphant
tone
here
come
here
i
went
up
to
him
and
he
pointing
with
his
finger
down
to
the
bird
and
looking
hard
in
my
face
at
the
same
time
said
there
cobbett
i
hope
that
will
be
a
to
you
never
to
be
obstinate
again
well
said
i
come
along
and
away
we
went
as
merry
as
larks
when
we
got
to
brown
he
told
them
the
story
triumphed
over
me
most
clamorously
and
though
he
often
repeated
the
story
to
my
face
i
never
had
the
heart
to
let
him
know
that
i
knew
of
the
imposition
which
puerile
vanity
had
induced
so
sensible
and
honourable
a
man
to
be
mean
enough
to
practise
a
is
almost
always
a
very
disagreeable
brother
sportsman
he
must
in
the
first
place
have
a
head
rather
of
the
emptiest
to
upon
so
poor
a
talent
then
he
is
always
out
of
temper
if
the
game
fail
or
if
he
miss
it
he
never
participates
in
that
great
delight
which
all
sensible
men
enjoy
at
beholding
the
beautiful
action
the
docility
the
zeal
the
wonderful
sagacity
of
the
pointer
and
the
setter
he
is
always
thinking
about
always
anxious
to
surpass
his
companions
i
remember
that
once
ewing
and
i
had
lost
our
dog
we
were
in
a
wood
and
the
dog
had
gone
out
and
found
a
covey
in
a
wheat
stubble
joining
the
wood
we
had
been
whistling
and
calling
him
for
perhaps
half
an
hour
or
more
when
we
came
out
of
the
wood
we
saw
him
pointing
with
one
foot
up
and
soon
after
he
keeping
his
foot
and
body
unmoved
gently
turned
round
his
head
towards
the
spot
where
he
heard
us
as
if
to
bid
us
come
on
and
when
he
saw
that
we
saw
him
turned
his
head
back
again
i
was
so
delighted
that
i
stopped
to
look
with
admiration
ewing
astonished
at
my
want
of
alacrity
pushed
on
shot
one
of
the
partridges
and
thought
no
more
about
the
conduct
of
the
dog
than
if
the
sagacious
creature
had
had
nothing
at
all
to
do
with
the
matter
when
i
left
america
in
i
gave
this
dog
to
lord
henry
stuart
who
was
when
he
came
home
a
year
or
two
afterwards
about
to
bring
him
to
astonish
the
sportsmen
even
in
england
but
those
of
pennsylvania
were
resolved
not
to
part
with
him
and
therefore
they
him
the
night
before
his
lordship
came
away
lord
henry
had
plenty
of
pointers
after
his
return
and
he
hundreds
but
always
declared
that
he
never
saw
any
thing
approaching
in
excellence
this
american
dog
for
the
information
of
sportsmen
i
ought
to
say
that
this
was
a
and
pointer
hair
as
fine
as
that
of
a
greyhound
little
and
short
ears
very
light
in
the
body
very
long
legged
and
swift
as
a
good
lurcher
i
had
him
a
puppy
and
he
never
had
any
but
he
pointed
staunchly
at
once
and
i
am
of
opinion
that
this
sort
is
in
all
respects
better
than
the
heavy
breed
thornton
i
beg
his
pardon
i
believe
he
is
now
a
knight
of
some
sort
who
was
and
perhaps
still
is
our
envoy
in
portugal
at
the
time
here
referred
to
was
a
sort
of
partner
with
lord
henry
in
this
famous
dog
and
gratitude
to
the
memory
of
i
mean
will
i
am
sure
or
at
least
i
hope
so
make
him
bear
witness
to
the
truth
of
my
character
of
him
and
if
one
could
hear
an
ambassador
i
think
that
thornton
would
acknowledge
that
his
calling
has
brought
him
in
pretty
close
contact
with
many
a
man
who
was
possessed
of
most
tremendous
political
power
without
possessing
half
the
sagacity
half
the
understanding
of
this
dog
and
without
being
a
thousandth
part
so
faithful
to
his
trust
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
there
are
as
many
of
men
as
there
are
of
dogs
swift
was
a
man
and
so
is
walter
the
base
but
is
the
the
same
it
can
not
be
alone
that
makes
the
amazing
difference
that
we
see
besides
we
see
men
of
the
very
same
rank
and
riches
and
education
differing
as
widely
as
the
pointer
does
from
the
pug
the
name
is
common
to
all
the
sorts
and
hence
arises
very
great
mischief
what
confusion
must
there
be
in
rural
affairs
if
there
were
no
names
whereby
to
distinguish
hounds
greyhounds
pointers
spaniels
terriers
and
sheep
dogs
from
each
other
and
what
pretty
work
if
without
regard
to
the
of
dogs
men
were
to
attempt
to
yet
this
is
done
in
the
case
of
a
man
is
always
and
without
the
least
regard
as
to
the
they
are
promiscuously
placed
in
all
kinds
of
situations
now
if
brougham
doctors
birkbeck
macculloch
and
black
and
that
profound
personage
lord
john
russell
will
in
their
london
university
teach
us
how
to
divide
men
instead
of
teaching
us
to
augment
the
capital
of
the
nation
by
making
they
will
render
us
a
real
service
that
will
be
worth
attending
to
what
would
be
said
of
the
who
should
take
a
out
to
find
partridges
for
him
to
shoot
at
yet
would
this
be
absurd
than
to
set
a
man
to
who
was
manifestly
formed
for
the
express
purpose
of
sweeping
the
streets
or
digging
out
sewers
surrey
thursday
we
came
over
the
heath
from
thursley
this
morning
on
our
way
to
winchester
wyndham
are
coming
to
thursley
on
saturday
more
than
of
all
the
interesting
talk
in
that
neighbourhood
for
some
days
past
has
been
about
this
event
i
have
seen
no
man
or
boy
who
did
not
talk
about
it
there
had
been
a
false
report
about
it
the
hounds
did
and
the
anger
of
the
disappointed
people
was
very
great
at
last
however
the
intelligence
came
and
i
left
them
all
as
happy
as
if
all
were
young
and
all
just
going
to
be
married
an
abatement
of
my
pleasure
however
on
this
joyous
occasion
was
that
i
brought
away
with
me
who
was
as
eager
as
the
best
of
them
richard
though
now
only
years
and
months
old
had
it
seems
one
in
herefordshire
last
winter
and
he
actually
has
begun
to
talk
rather
of
hare
hunting
to
show
me
that
he
is
in
no
he
has
been
leaping
his
horse
over
banks
and
ditches
by
the
road
side
all
our
way
across
the
country
from
reigate
and
he
joined
with
such
glee
in
talking
of
the
expected
arrival
of
the
that
i
felt
some
little
pain
at
bringing
him
away
my
engagement
at
winchester
is
for
saturday
but
if
it
had
not
been
so
the
deep
and
hidden
ruts
in
the
heath
in
a
wood
in
the
midst
of
which
the
hounds
are
sure
to
find
and
the
immense
concourse
of
horsemen
that
is
sure
to
be
assembled
would
have
made
me
bring
him
away
upon
the
high
hard
and
open
countries
i
should
not
be
afraid
for
him
but
here
the
danger
would
have
been
greater
than
it
would
have
been
right
for
me
to
suffer
him
to
run
we
came
hither
by
the
way
of
waverley
abbey
and
moore
park
on
the
commons
i
showed
richard
some
of
my
old
hunting
scenes
when
i
was
of
his
age
or
younger
reminding
him
that
i
was
obliged
to
hunt
on
foot
we
got
leave
to
go
and
see
the
grounds
at
waverley
where
all
the
old
monks
garden
walls
are
totally
gone
and
where
the
spot
is
become
a
sort
of
lawn
i
showed
him
the
spot
where
the
strawberry
garden
was
and
where
i
when
sent
to
gather
used
to
eat
every
remarkably
fine
one
instead
of
letting
it
go
to
be
eaten
by
sir
robert
rich
i
showed
him
a
tree
close
by
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
from
a
limb
of
which
i
once
fell
into
the
river
in
an
attempt
to
take
the
nest
of
a
which
had
artfully
placed
it
upon
a
branch
so
far
from
the
trunk
as
not
to
be
able
to
bear
the
weight
of
a
boy
eight
years
old
i
showed
him
an
old
elm
tree
which
was
hollow
even
then
into
which
i
when
a
very
little
boy
once
saw
a
cat
go
that
was
as
big
as
a
spaniel
dog
for
relating
which
i
got
a
great
scolding
for
standing
to
which
i
at
last
got
a
beating
but
stand
to
which
i
still
did
i
have
since
many
times
repeated
it
and
i
would
take
my
oath
of
it
to
this
day
when
in
new
brunswick
i
saw
the
great
wild
grey
cat
which
is
there
called
a
and
it
seemed
to
me
to
be
just
such
a
cat
as
i
had
seen
at
waverley
i
found
the
ruins
not
very
greatly
diminished
but
it
is
strange
how
small
the
mansion
and
ground
and
everything
but
the
trees
appeared
to
me
they
were
all
great
to
my
mind
when
i
saw
them
last
and
that
early
impression
had
remained
whenever
i
had
talked
or
thought
of
the
spot
so
that
when
i
came
to
see
them
again
after
seeing
the
sea
and
so
many
other
immense
things
it
seemed
as
if
they
had
all
been
made
small
this
was
not
the
case
with
regard
to
the
trees
which
are
nearly
as
big
here
as
they
are
anywhere
else
and
the
old
for
instance
which
richard
measured
with
his
whip
is
about
or
feet
round
from
waverley
we
went
to
moore
park
once
the
seat
of
sir
william
temple
and
when
i
was
a
very
little
boy
the
seat
of
a
lady
or
a
temple
here
i
showed
richard
mother
ludlum
hole
but
alas
it
is
not
the
enchanting
place
that
i
knew
it
nor
that
which
grose
describes
in
his
antiquities
the
semicircular
paling
is
gone
the
basins
to
catch
the
little
stream
are
gone
the
iron
cups
fastened
by
chains
for
people
to
drink
out
of
are
gone
the
pavement
all
broken
to
pieces
the
seats
for
people
to
sit
on
on
both
sides
of
the
cave
torn
up
and
gone
the
stream
that
ran
down
a
clean
paved
channel
now
making
a
dirty
gutter
and
the
ground
opposite
which
was
a
grove
chiefly
of
laurels
intersected
by
closely
mowed
now
become
a
poor
near
the
mansion
i
showed
richard
the
hill
upon
which
dean
swift
tells
us
he
used
to
run
for
exercise
while
he
was
pursuing
his
studies
here
and
i
would
have
showed
him
the
under
which
sir
william
temple
heart
was
buried
agreeably
to
his
will
but
the
seat
was
gone
also
the
wall
at
the
back
of
it
and
the
exquisitely
beautiful
little
lawn
in
which
the
seat
stood
was
turned
into
a
parcel
of
planted
according
to
the
strictest
rules
of
artificial
and
refined
vulgarity
at
waverley
thompson
a
merchant
of
some
sort
has
succeeded
after
the
monks
the
orby
hunters
and
sir
robert
rich
at
moore
park
a
laing
a
west
indian
planter
or
merchant
has
succeeded
the
temples
and
at
the
castle
of
farnham
which
you
see
from
moore
park
bishop
prettyman
tomline
has
at
last
after
perfectly
regular
and
due
gradations
succeeded
william
of
wykham
in
coming
up
from
moore
park
to
farnham
town
i
stopped
opposite
the
door
of
a
little
old
house
where
there
appeared
to
be
a
great
parcel
of
children
there
dick
said
i
when
i
was
just
such
a
little
creature
as
that
whom
you
see
in
the
i
lived
in
this
very
house
with
my
cobbett
he
pulled
up
his
horse
and
looked
hard
at
but
said
nothing
and
on
we
came
sunday
noon
we
came
away
from
farnham
about
noon
on
friday
promising
bishop
prettyman
to
notice
him
and
his
way
of
living
more
fully
on
our
return
at
alton
we
got
some
bread
and
cheese
at
a
friend
and
then
came
to
alresford
by
medstead
in
order
to
have
fine
turf
to
ride
on
and
to
see
on
this
lofty
land
that
which
is
perhaps
the
finest
in
all
england
these
high
are
not
garden
plats
like
kent
but
they
have
from
my
first
seeing
them
when
i
was
about
always
been
my
delight
large
sweeping
downs
and
deep
dells
here
and
there
with
villages
amongst
lofty
trees
are
my
great
delight
when
we
got
to
alresford
it
was
nearly
dark
and
not
being
able
to
find
a
room
to
our
liking
we
resolved
to
go
though
in
the
dark
to
easton
a
village
about
six
miles
from
alresford
down
by
the
side
of
the
hichen
river
coming
from
easton
yesterday
i
learned
that
sir
charles
ogle
the
eldest
son
and
successor
of
sir
chaloner
ogle
had
sold
to
some
his
mansion
and
estate
at
martyr
worthy
a
village
on
the
north
side
of
the
hichen
just
opposite
easton
the
ogles
had
been
here
for
couple
of
perhaps
they
are
off
for
good
and
all
as
the
country
people
call
it
well
what
i
have
to
say
to
sir
charles
ogle
upon
this
occasion
is
this
it
was
who
moved
at
the
county
meeting
in
that
to
the
which
you
brought
ready
engrossed
upon
parchment
which
fleming
the
sheriff
declared
to
have
been
carried
though
a
word
of
it
never
was
heard
by
the
meeting
which
address
the
power
of
imprisonment
bill
just
then
and
the
like
of
which
address
you
will
not
in
all
human
probability
ever
again
move
in
hampshire
and
i
hope
nowhere
else
so
you
see
sir
charles
there
is
one
consolation
at
any
rate
i
learned
too
that
greame
a
famously
loyal
and
justice
whose
son
was
a
few
years
ago
made
a
distributor
of
stamps
in
this
county
was
become
so
modest
as
to
exchange
his
big
and
ancient
mansion
at
cheriton
or
somewhere
there
for
a
very
house
in
the
town
of
alresford
i
saw
his
household
goods
advertised
in
the
hampshire
newspaper
a
little
while
ago
to
be
sold
by
public
auction
i
rubbed
my
eyes
or
rather
my
spectacles
and
looked
again
and
again
for
i
remembered
the
loyal
and
i
with
singular
satisfaction
record
this
change
in
his
scale
of
existence
which
has
no
doubt
proceeded
solely
from
that
prevalence
of
mind
over
matter
which
the
scotch
have
taken
such
pains
to
inculcate
and
which
makes
him
flee
from
greatness
as
from
that
which
diminishes
the
quantity
of
enjoyment
and
so
now
he
wondering
man
can
want
the
larger
pile
exults
and
owns
his
cottage
with
a
smile
and
they
really
tell
me
that
his
present
house
is
not
much
bigger
than
that
of
my
dear
good
old
grandmother
cobbett
but
and
it
may
not
be
wholly
useless
for
the
to
know
it
she
never
burnt
but
dipped
in
grease
as
i
have
described
them
in
my
and
this
was
one
of
the
means
that
she
made
use
of
in
order
to
secure
a
bit
of
good
bacon
and
good
bread
to
eat
and
that
made
her
never
give
me
cold
or
hot
no
bad
hint
for
the
father
of
the
distributor
of
stamps
good
bacon
is
a
very
nice
thing
i
can
assure
him
and
if
the
quantity
be
small
it
is
all
the
sweeter
provided
however
it
be
not
this
used
to
be
a
great
friend
of
old
george
rose
but
his
patron
taste
was
different
from
his
george
preferred
a
big
house
to
a
little
one
and
george
with
a
little
one
and
with
a
big
one
just
by
alresford
there
was
another
old
friend
and
supporter
of
old
george
rose
rawlinson
whom
i
remember
a
very
great
in
this
county
he
is
now
a
in
london
and
is
one
of
those
guardians
of
the
wen
respecting
whose
proceedings
we
read
eternal
columns
in
the
this
being
sunday
i
heard
about
in
the
morning
a
sort
of
a
jangling
made
by
a
bell
or
two
in
the
we
were
getting
ready
to
be
off
to
cross
the
country
to
burghclere
which
lies
under
the
lofty
hills
at
highclere
about
miles
from
this
city
but
hearing
the
bells
of
the
cathedral
i
took
richard
to
show
him
that
ancient
and
most
magnificent
pile
and
particularly
to
show
him
the
tomb
of
that
famous
bishop
of
winchester
william
of
wykham
who
was
the
chancellor
and
the
minister
of
the
great
and
glorious
king
edward
iii
who
sprang
from
poor
parents
in
the
little
village
of
wykham
three
miles
from
botley
and
who
amongst
other
great
and
most
munificent
deeds
founded
the
famous
college
or
school
of
winchester
and
also
one
of
the
colleges
at
oxford
i
told
richard
about
this
as
we
went
from
the
inn
down
to
the
cathedral
and
when
i
him
the
where
the
bishop
lies
on
his
back
in
his
catholic
robes
with
his
mitre
on
his
head
his
shepherd
crook
by
his
side
with
little
children
at
his
feet
their
hands
put
together
in
a
praying
attitude
he
looked
with
a
degree
of
inquisitive
earnestness
that
pleased
me
very
much
i
took
him
as
far
as
i
could
about
the
cathedral
the
service
was
now
begun
there
is
a
and
god
knows
how
many
belonging
to
this
immensely
rich
bishopric
and
chapter
and
there
were
at
this
service
or
three
men
and
five
or
six
in
white
surplices
with
a
congregation
of
and
gracious
god
if
william
of
wykham
could
at
that
moment
have
been
raised
from
his
tomb
if
saint
swithin
whose
name
the
cathedral
bears
or
alfred
the
great
to
whom
swithin
was
tutor
if
either
of
these
could
have
come
and
had
been
told
that
was
what
was
carried
on
by
men
who
talked
of
the
errors
of
those
who
founded
that
very
church
but
it
beggars
one
feelings
to
attempt
to
find
words
whereby
to
express
them
upon
such
a
subject
and
such
an
occasion
how
then
am
i
to
describe
what
i
felt
when
i
yesterday
saw
in
hyde
meadow
a
standing
on
the
very
spot
where
stood
the
abbey
which
was
founded
and
endowed
by
alfred
which
contained
the
bones
of
that
maker
of
the
english
name
and
also
those
of
the
learned
monk
grimbald
whom
alfred
brought
to
england
begin
the
teaching
at
after
we
came
out
of
the
cathedral
richard
said
why
papa
nobody
can
build
such
places
can
they
no
my
dear
said
i
that
building
was
made
when
there
were
no
poor
wretches
in
england
called
when
there
were
no
when
every
labouring
man
was
clothed
in
good
woollen
cloth
and
when
all
had
a
plenty
of
meat
and
bread
and
beer
this
talk
lasted
us
to
the
inn
where
just
as
we
were
going
to
set
off
it
most
curiously
happened
that
a
parcel
which
had
come
from
kensington
by
the
night
coach
was
put
into
my
hands
by
the
landlord
containing
amongst
other
things
a
pamphlet
sent
to
me
from
rome
being
an
italian
translation
of
no
of
the
i
will
here
insert
the
title
for
the
satisfaction
of
doctor
black
who
some
time
ago
expressed
his
utter
astonishment
that
a
work
should
be
published
in
the
century
why
doctor
did
you
want
me
to
stop
till
the
century
that
would
have
been
a
little
too
long

ride

monday
morning
october
we
had
or
i
had
resolved
not
to
breakfast
at
winchester
yesterday
and
yet
we
were
detained
till
nearly
noon
but
at
last
off
we
came
the
from
winchester
to
this
place
comes
through
a
village
called
sutton
scotney
and
then
through
whitchurch
which
lies
on
the
andover
and
london
road
through
basingstoke
we
did
not
take
the
till
we
came
to
whitchurch
we
went
to
king
worthy
that
is
about
two
miles
on
the
road
from
winchester
to
london
and
then
turning
short
to
our
left
came
up
upon
the
downs
to
the
north
of
winchester
here
looking
back
at
the
city
and
at
the
fine
valley
above
and
below
it
and
at
the
many
smaller
valleys
that
run
down
from
the
high
ridges
into
that
great
and
fertile
valley
i
could
not
help
admiring
the
taste
of
the
ancient
kings
who
made
this
city
which
once
covered
all
the
hill
round
about
and
which
contained
churches
and
chapels
a
chief
place
of
their
residence
there
are
not
many
finer
spots
in
england
and
if
i
were
to
take
in
a
circle
of
eight
or
ten
miles
of
i
should
say
that
i
believe
there
is
not
one
so
fine
here
are
hill
dell
water
meadows
woods
downs
and
all
of
them
very
fine
and
very
beautifully
disposed
this
country
does
not
present
to
us
that
sort
of
beauties
which
we
see
about
guildford
and
godalming
and
round
the
skirts
of
hindhead
and
blackdown
where
the
ground
lies
in
the
form
that
the
in
a
boiling
copper
would
be
in
if
you
could
by
word
of
command
it
be
the
bubbles
all
sticking
up
and
really
to
look
at
the
face
of
the
earth
who
can
help
imagining
that
some
such
process
has
produced
its
present
form
leaving
this
matter
to
be
solved
by
those
who
laugh
at
mysteries
i
repeat
that
the
country
round
winchester
does
not
present
to
us
beauties
of
but
of
a
sort
which
i
like
a
great
deal
better
arthur
young
calls
the
vale
between
farnham
and
alton
finest
ten
in
england
here
is
a
river
with
fine
meadows
on
each
side
of
it
and
with
rising
grounds
on
each
outside
of
the
meadows
those
grounds
having
some
and
some
pretty
woods
but
though
i
was
born
in
this
vale
i
must
confess
that
the
ten
miles
between
maidstone
and
tunbridge
which
the
kentish
folks
call
the
of
is
a
great
deal
finer
for
here
with
a
river
three
times
as
big
and
a
vale
three
times
as
broad
there
are
on
rising
grounds
six
times
as
broad
not
only
and
beautiful
woods
but
immense
orchards
of
apples
pears
plums
cherries
and
filberts
and
these
in
many
cases
with
gooseberries
and
currants
and
raspberries
beneath
and
all
taken
together
the
vale
is
really
worthy
of
the
appellation
which
it
bears
but
even
this
spot
which
i
believe
to
be
the
very
finest
as
to
fertility
and
diminutive
beauty
in
this
whole
world
i
for
my
part
do
not
like
so
well
nay
as
a
spot
to
i
think
nothing
at
all
of
it
compared
with
a
country
where
high
downs
prevail
with
here
and
there
a
large
wood
on
the
top
or
the
side
of
a
hill
and
where
you
see
in
the
deep
dells
here
and
there
a
and
here
and
there
a
village
the
buildings
sheltered
by
a
group
of
lofty
trees
this
is
my
taste
and
here
in
the
north
of
hampshire
it
has
its
full
gratification
i
like
to
look
at
the
winding
side
of
a
great
down
with
two
or
three
numerous
flocks
of
sheep
on
it
belonging
to
different
farms
and
to
see
lower
down
the
folds
in
the
fields
ready
to
receive
them
for
the
night
we
had
when
we
got
upon
the
downs
after
leaving
winchester
this
sort
of
country
all
the
way
to
whitchurch
our
point
of
destination
was
this
village
of
burghclere
which
lies
close
under
the
north
side
of
the
lofty
hill
at
highclere
which
is
called
beacon
hill
and
on
the
top
of
which
there
are
still
the
marks
of
a
roman
encampment
we
saw
this
hill
as
soon
as
we
got
on
winchester
downs
and
without
any
regard
to
we
for
it
as
sailors
do
for
a
of
these
miles
from
winchester
to
whitchurch
we
rode
about
eight
or
nine
upon
the
or
over
fields
equally
smooth
and
here
is
one
great
pleasure
of
living
in
countries
of
this
sort
no
sloughs
no
ditches
no
nasty
dirty
lanes
and
the
hedges
where
there
are
any
are
more
for
boundary
marks
than
for
fences
fine
for
hunting
and
coursing
no
impediments
no
gates
to
open
nothing
to
impede
the
dogs
the
horses
or
the
view
the
water
is
not
but
the
great
bed
of
chalk
and
the
sun
draws
it
up
for
the
benefit
of
the
grass
and
the
corn
and
whatever
inconvenience
is
experienced
from
the
necessity
of
deep
wells
and
of
driving
sheep
and
cattle
far
to
water
is
amply
made
up
for
by
the
goodness
of
the
water
and
by
the
complete
absence
of
floods
of
drains
of
ditches
and
of
as
now
however
these
countries
have
one
great
drawback
the
poor
suffer
from
the
want
of
fuel
and
they
have
nothing
but
their
for
these
reasons
they
are
greatly
worse
off
than
those
of
the
and
it
is
really
surprising
what
a
difference
there
is
between
the
faces
that
you
see
here
and
the
round
red
faces
that
you
see
in
the
and
the
particularly
in
sussex
where
the
labourers
have
a
of
some
sort
or
other
and
where
they
have
to
sit
by
in
the
winter
after
steering
for
some
time
we
came
down
to
a
very
fine
farmhouse
which
we
stopped
a
little
to
admire
and
i
asked
richard
whether
was
not
a
place
to
be
happy
in
the
village
which
we
found
to
be
was
about
a
mile
lower
down
this
little
vale
before
we
got
to
it
we
overtook
the
owner
of
the
farm
who
knew
me
though
i
did
not
know
him
but
when
i
found
it
was
hinton
bailey
of
whom
and
whose
farm
i
had
heard
so
much
i
was
not
at
all
surprised
at
the
fineness
of
what
i
had
just
seen
i
told
him
that
the
word
making
as
it
did
part
of
the
name
of
this
place
had
nearly
inspired
me
with
boldness
enough
to
go
to
the
farmhouse
in
the
ancient
style
and
ask
for
something
to
eat
for
that
we
had
not
yet
breakfasted
he
asked
us
to
go
back
but
at
burghclere
we
were
to
after
however
crossing
the
village
and
beginning
again
to
ascend
the
downs
we
came
to
a
labourer
a
where
i
asked
the
man
whether
he
had
any
and
and
was
not
a
little
pleased
to
hear
him
say
then
i
asked
him
to
give
us
a
bit
protesting
that
we
had
not
yet
broken
our
fast
he
answered
in
the
affirmative
at
once
though
i
did
not
talk
of
payment
his
wife
brought
out
the
cut
loaf
and
a
piece
of
wiltshire
cheese
and
i
took
them
in
hand
gave
richard
a
good
hunch
and
took
another
for
myself
i
verily
believe
that
all
the
pleasure
of
eating
enjoyed
by
all
the
feeders
in
london
in
a
whole
year
does
not
equal
that
which
we
enjoyed
in
gnawing
this
bread
and
cheese
as
we
rode
over
this
cold
down
whip
and
in
one
hand
and
the
hunch
in
the
other
richard
who
was
purse
bearer
gave
the
woman
by
my
direction
about
enough
to
buy
two
quartern
loaves
for
she
told
me
that
they
had
to
buy
their
bread
the
not
being
able
to
bake
themselves
for
of
and
this
as
i
said
before
is
one
of
the
in
this
sort
of
country
i
wish
every
one
of
these
people
had
an
here
they
might
then
even
in
these
bare
countries
have
comfortable
warmth
rubbish
of
any
sort
would
by
this
means
give
them
warmth
i
am
now
at
six
in
the
morning
sitting
in
a
room
where
one
of
these
with
very
light
in
it
gives
as
good
and
steady
a
warmth
as
it
is
possible
to
feel
and
which
room
has
too
been
of
by
this
before
we
got
this
supply
of
bread
and
cheese
we
though
in
ordinary
times
a
couple
of
singularly
jovial
companions
and
seldom
going
a
hundred
yards
except
going
very
fast
without
one
or
the
other
speaking
began
to
grow
or
rather
the
way
seemed
long
and
when
i
had
to
speak
in
answer
to
richard
the
speaking
was
as
brief
as
might
be
unfortunately
just
at
this
critical
period
one
of
the
loops
that
held
the
straps
of
richard
little
portmanteau
broke
and
it
became
necessary
just
before
we
overtook
bailey
for
me
to
fasten
the
portmanteau
on
before
me
upon
my
saddle
this
which
was
not
the
work
of
more
than
five
minutes
would
had
i
had
have
been
nothing
at
all
and
indeed
matter
of
laughter
but
it
was
it
was
his
for
capering
and
jerking
about
i
jumped
off
saying
i
carry
it
and
then
i
began
to
take
off
the
remaining
strap
pulling
with
great
violence
and
in
great
haste
just
at
this
time
my
eyes
met
his
in
which
i
saw
and
feeling
the
just
rebuke
feeling
heartily
ashamed
of
myself
i
instantly
changed
my
tone
and
manner
cast
the
blame
upon
the
saddler
and
talked
of
the
effectual
means
which
we
would
take
to
prevent
the
like
in
future
now
if
such
was
the
effect
produced
upon
me
by
the
want
of
food
for
only
two
or
three
hours
me
who
had
dined
well
the
day
before
and
eaten
toast
and
butter
the
if
the
missing
of
only
one
breakfast
and
that
too
from
my
own
whim
while
i
had
money
in
my
pocket
to
get
one
at
any
and
while
i
could
get
one
only
for
asking
for
at
any
if
the
not
having
breakfasted
could
and
under
such
circumstances
make
me
what
you
may
call
to
a
child
like
this
whom
i
must
necessarily
love
so
much
and
to
whom
i
never
speak
but
in
the
very
kindest
manner
if
this
mere
absence
of
a
breakfast
could
thus
put
me
of
how
great
are
the
allowances
that
we
ought
to
make
for
the
poor
creatures
who
in
this
once
happy
and
now
miserable
country
are
doomed
to
lead
a
life
of
constant
labour
and
of
i
suppose
that
as
we
rode
away
from
the
cottage
we
gnawed
up
between
us
a
pound
of
bread
and
a
quarter
of
a
pound
of
cheese
here
was
about
worth
at
present
prices
even
this
which
was
only
a
mere
a
mere
for
us
would
for
us
two
come
to
a
week
all
but
a
penny
how
then
gracious
god
is
a
labouring
man
his
wife
and
perhaps
four
or
five
small
children
to
exist
upon
or
a
week
aye
and
to
find
clothing
bedding
and
fuel
out
of
it
richard
and
i
ate
here
at
this
snap
more
and
much
more
than
the
average
of
labourers
their
wives
and
children
have
to
eat
in
a
whole
day
and
that
the
labourer
has
to
on
too
when
we
got
here
to
burghclere
we
were
again
as
as
hunters
what
then
must
be
the
life
of
these
poor
creatures
but
is
not
the
state
of
the
country
is
not
the
hellishness
of
the
system
all
depicted
in
this
one
disgraceful
and
damning
fact
that
the
magistrates
who
settle
on
what
the
ought
to
have
to
live
on
allow
them
less
than
is
allowed
to
felons
in
the
gaols
and
allow
them
for
clothing
and
fuel
and
and
yet
while
this
is
notoriously
the
case
while
the
main
body
of
the
working
class
in
england
are
fed
and
clad
and
even
lodged
worse
than
felons
and
are
daily
becoming
even
worse
and
worse
off
the
king
is
advised
to
tell
the
parliament
and
the
world
that
we
are
in
a
state
of
and
that
this
prosperity
must
be
because
great
are
the
working
people
are
not
then
a
interest
they
will
be
found
to
be
one
what
is
to
be
the
of
this
what
can
be
the
of
it
but
dreadful
convulsion
what
other
can
be
produced
by
a
system
which
allows
the
better
food
better
clothing
and
better
lodging
than
the
i
see
that
there
has
been
a
grand
in
norfolk
to
assure
the
parliament
that
these
will
it
in
any
measures
that
it
may
adopt
for
freeing
the
negroes

into

will
find

shivering
dejected
mortals
such
as
never
were

buxton
if
it
were
worth
while
to
with
these
people
one
might
ask
them
whether
they
do
not
think
that
is
likely
to
relieve
them
of
all
these
cares
simply
by
making
the
colonies
transfer
their
allegiance
or
assert
their
independence
but
to
reason
with
them
is
useless
if
they
can
busy
themselves
with
compassion
for
the
negroes
while
they
uphold
the
system
that
makes
the
labourers
of
england
more
wretched
and
beyond
all
measure
more
wretched
than
any
negro
slaves
are
or
ever
were
or
ever
can
be
they
are
unworthy
of
anything
but
our
contempt
but
the
education
canters
are
the
most
curious
fellows
of
all
they
have
seen
education
as
they
call
it
and
crimes
go
on
increasing
together
till
the
gaols
though
six
times
their
former
dimensions
will
hardly
suffice
and
yet
the
canting
creatures
still
cry
that
crimes
arise
from
want
of
what
they
call
education
they
see
the
felon
better
fed
and
better
clad
than
the
honest
labourer
they
see
this
and
yet
they
continually
cry
that
the
crimes
arise
from
a
want
of
education
what
can
be
the
cause
of
this
perverseness
it
is
not
perverseness
it
is
and
the
tyrant
the
unfeeling
tyrant
squeezes
the
labourers
for
gain
sake
and
the
corrupt
politician
and
literary
or
tub
rogue
find
an
excuse
for
him
by
pretending
that
it
is
not
want
of
food
and
clothing
but
want
of
education
that
makes
the
poor
starving
wretches
thieves
and
robbers
if
the
press
if
only
the
press
were
to
do
its
duty
or
but
a
tenth
part
of
its
duty
this
hellish
system
could
not
go
on
but
it
favours
the
system
by
ascribing
the
misery
to
wrong
causes
the
causes
are
these
the
presses
the
landlord
the
landlord
the
farmer
and
the
farmer
the
labourer
here
it
falls
at
last
and
this
class
is
made
so
miserable
that
a
life
is
better
than
that
of
a
does
there
want
any
to
produce
crimes
but
on
these
causes
so
clear
to
the
eye
of
reason
so
plain
from
experience
the
press
scarcely
ever
says
a
single
word
while
it
keeps
bothering
our
brains
about
education
and
morality
and
about
ignorance
and
immorality
leading
to
to
be
sure
immorality
leads
to
felonies
who
does
not
know
that
but
who
is
to
expect
morality
in
a
man
who
is
whipped
if
he
do
not
work
though
he
has
not
for
his
whole
food
so
much
as
i
and
my
little
boy
snapped
up
in
six
or
seven
minutes
upon
down
aye
but
if
the
press
were
to
ascribe
the
increase
of
crimes
to
the
true
causes
it
must
further
it
must
go
to
the
of
the
it
must
go
to
the
debt
the
the
thundering
standing
army
the
enormous
sinecures
pensions
and
grants
and
this
would
suit
but
a
very
small
part
of
a
which
lives
and
thrives
principally
by
one
or
the
other
of
these
as
with
the
press
so
is
it
with
brougham
and
all
such
politicians
they
stop
short
or
rather
they
begin
in
the
middle
they
attempt
to
prevent
the
evils
of
the
deadly
ivy
by
cropping
off
or
rather
bruising
a
little
a
few
of
its
leaves
they
do
not
assail
even
its
branches
while
they
appear
to
look
upon
the
as
something
even
to
be
with
vulgar
eyes
is
not
the
injury
recently
done
to
about
thousand
poor
in
and
near
plymouth
by
the
bill
a
thing
that
brougham
ought
to
think
about
before
he
thinks
anything
more
about
those
poor
families
yet
will
he
when
he
again
meets
the
ministers
say
a
word
about
this
monstrous
evil
i
am
afraid
that
no
member
will
say
a
word
about
it
but
i
am
rather
more
than
afraid
that
will
not
and
because
if
he
reproach
the
ministers
with
this
crying
cruelty
they
will
ask
him
first
how
this
is
to
be
prevented
without
a
repeal
of
the
bill
by
which
peel
bill
was
partly
repealed
then
they
will
ask
him
how
the
prices
are
to
be
kept
up
without

they
will
say

times
declared

without
an
application
to
new
purposes
of

great

called

almost
bursting
with
rage
how
the

to

me
capable
of

we
suppose

we
only
ask
the
question
and
we
ask

to
put

inevitably

these
things

then
would
it
not
be
better
for
the
honourable
and
learned
gentleman
to
his
all
men
of
sense
and
sincerity
will
at
once
answer
this
last
question
in
the
affirmative
they
will
all
say
that
this
is
not
to
the
ministers
the
ministers
do
not
to
see
families
nor
any
families
at
all
who
give
them
real
reduced
to
misery
they
do
not
to
cripple
their
own
very
far
from
it
if
they
could
carry
on
the
debt
and
and
place
and
pension
and
barrack
system
without
reducing
any
people
to
misery
they
would
like
it
exceedingly
but
they
wish
to
carry
on
that
system
and
he
does
not
them
who
does
not
endeavour
to
put
an
end
to
the
system
this
is
done
by
nobody
in
parliament
and
therefore
there
is
in
fact
and
this
is
felt
by
the
whole
nation
and
this
is
the
reason
why
now
take
so
little
interest
in
what
is
said
and
done
in
parliament
compared
to
that
which
they
formerly
took
this
is
the
reason
why
there
is
no
man
or
men
whom
the
people
seem
to
care
at
all
about
a
great
portion
of
the
people
now
clearly
understand
the
nature
and
effects
of
the
system
they
are
not
now
to
be
deceived
by
speeches
and
professions
if
pitt
and
fox
had
to
there
would
be
no
pittites
and
foxites
those
happy
days
of
political
humbug
are
gone
for
ever
the
gentlemen
are
opposite
only
as
to
mere
they
sit
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
that
all
in
every
other
respect
they
are
like
parson
and
clerk
or
perhaps
rather
more
like
the
rooks
and
jackdaws
one
and
the
other
but
both
have
the
same
object
in
view
both
are
in
pursuit
of
the
same
sort
of
diet
one
set
is
to
be
sure
in
place
and
the
other
out
but
though
the
rooks
keep
the
jackdaws
on
the
inferior
branches
these
latter
would
be
as
clamorous
as
the
rooks
themselves
against
the
and
just
as
clamorous
would
the
gentlemen
opposite
be
against
any
one
who
should
propose
to
put
down
the
system
itself
and
yet
unless
you
do
things
must
go
on
in
the
present
way
and
must
be
than
and
starvation
and
thieving
and
robbing
and
and
transporting
and
hanging
and
penal
laws
must
go
on
increasing
as
they
have
gone
on
from
the
day
of
the
establishment
of
the
debt
to
the
present
hour
apropos
of
doctor
black
of
the
morning
chronicle
is
now
filling
whole
columns
with
very
just
remarks
on
the
new
and
terrible
law
which
makes
the
taking
of
an
apple
but
he
says
not
a
word
about
the
of
sir
jammy
the
humane
upon
this
subject
the
and
of
the
parliament
have
relieved
men
addicted
to
and
to
other
from
the
disgrace
of
the
pillory
and
they
have
since
castlereagh
cut
his
own
throat
relieved
from
the
disgrace
of
the
burial
but
the
same
parliament
amidst
all
the
workings
of
this
rare
humanity
and
liberality
have
made
it
to
take
an
apple
off
a
which
last
year
was
a
trivial
trespass
and
was
formerly
no
offence
at
all
however
even
this
as
long
as
this
system
continue
in
its
present
way
and
all
complaints
about
severity
of
laws
levelled
at
the
poor
are
useless
and
foolish
and
these
complaints
are
even
base
in
those
who
do
their
best
to
uphold
a
system
which
has
brought
honest
labourer
to
be
fed
worse
than
the
what
short
of
such
laws
can
prevent
from
coming
to
take
away
the
dinners
of
those
who
have
plenty
despicable
cant
and
nonsense
what
education
what
moral
precepts
can
quiet
the
gnawings
and
ragings
of
hunger
looking
now
back
again
for
a
minute
to
the
little
village
of
the
name
of
which
seems
to
indicate
that
its
rents
formerly
belonged
wholly
to
the
poor
and
indigent
part
of
the
community
it
is
near
to
winchester
that
grand
scene
of
ancient
learning
piety
and
munificence
be
this
as
it
may
the
parish
formerly
contained
ten
farms
and
it
now
contains
but
two
which
are
owned
by
hinton
bailey
and
his
nephew
and
therefore
which
may
probably
become
there
used
to
be
ten
families
in
this
parish
at
any
rate
these
taking
five
to
a
family
made
fifty
people
and
now
all
are
except
the
curate
and
the
two
families
the
is
not
the
it
is
nobody
it
is
due
to
the
infernal
and
system
which
drives
property
into
large
masses
in
order
to
which
crushes
little
proprietors
down
into
labourers
and
which
presses
them
down
in
that
state
there
takes
their
wages
from
them
and
makes
them
their
share
of
food
and
raiment
being
taken
away
to
support
debt
and
and
army
and
all
the
rest
of
the
enormous
expenses
which
are
required
to
sustain
this
intolerable
system
those
therefore
are
fools
or
hypocrites
who
affect
to
wish
to
better
the
lot
of
the
poor
labourers
and
manufacturers
while
they
at
the
same
time
either
actively
or
passively
uphold
the
system
which
is
the
manifest
cause
of
it
here
is
a
system
which
clearly
as
the
nose
upon
your
face
you
see
taking
away
the
little
estate
the
little
farmer
farm
the
poor
labourer
and
and
while
you
see
this
so
plainly
you
fool
or
hypocrite
as
you
are
cry
out
for
supporting
the
system
that
causes
it
all
go
on
base
wretch
but
remember
that
of
such
a
progress
dreadful
must
be
the
end
the
day
will
come
when
millions
of
creatures
will
be
in
a
state
that
they
and
you
now
little
dream
of
all
that
we
now
behold
of
and
the
like
are
mere
of
what
the
great
body
of
the
suffering
people
and
of
the
thoughts
that
are
passing
in
their
minds
the
work
of
and
will
only
add
to
what
would
be
quite
enough
without
them
there
is
not
a
labourer
in
the
whole
country
who
does
not
see
to
the
bottom
of
this
work
they
are
in
this
respect
hunger
has
opened
their
eyes
i
engage
that
there
is
not
even
in
this
obscure
village
of
one
single
creature
however
forlorn
who
does
not
understand
all
about
the
of
the
school
and
the
tract
and
the
bible
affair
as
well
as
butterworth
or
rivington
or
as
joshua
watson
himself
just
after
we
had
finished
the
bread
and
cheese
we
crossed
the
turnpike
road
that
goes
from
basingstoke
to
stockbridge
and
bailey
had
told
us
that
we
were
then
to
bear
away
to
our
right
and
go
to
the
end
of
a
wood
which
we
saw
one
end
of
and
keep
round
with
that
wood
or
coppice
as
he
called
it
to
our
left
but
we
seeing
beacon
hill
more
to
the
left
and
resolving
to
go
as
nearly
as
possible
in
a
straight
line
to
it
steered
directly
over
the
fields
that
is
to
say
pieces
of
ground
from
to
acres
in
each
but
a
hill
which
we
had
to
go
over
had
here
hidden
from
our
sight
a
part
of
this
coppice
which
consists
perhaps
of
or
acres
and
which
we
found
sweeping
round
in
a
form
so
far
from
towards
our
left
as
to
bring
our
over
the
coppice
at
about
the
of
the
latter
upon
this
discovery
we
slackened
sail
for
this
coppice
might
be
a
mile
across
and
though
the
bottom
was
sound
enough
being
a
coverlet
of
flints
upon
a
bed
of
chalk
the
underwood
was
too
high
and
too
thick
for
us
to
face
being
as
we
were
at
so
great
a
distance
from
the
means
of
obtaining
a
fresh
supply
of
clothes
our
leather
leggings
would
have
stood
anything
but
our
coats
were
of
the
common
kind
and
before
we
saw
the
other
side
of
the
coppice
we
should
i
dare
say
have
been
as
ragged
as
in
the
month
of
march
in
this
dilemma
i
stopped
and
looked
at
the
coppice
luckily
two
boys
who
had
been
cutting
sticks
to
i
dare
say
at
least
hope
made
their
appearance
at
about
half
a
mile
off
on
the
side
for
the
coppice
richard
galloped
off
to
the
boys
from
whom
he
found
that
in
one
part
of
the
coppice
there
was
a
road
cut
across
the
point
of
entrance
into
which
road
they
explained
to
him
this
was
to
us
what
the
discovery
of
a
canal
across
the
isthmus
of
darien
would
be
to
a
ship
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
wanting
to
get
into
the
pacific
without
doubling
cape
horne
a
beautiful
road
we
found
it
i
should
suppose
the
best
part
of
a
mile
long
perfectly
straight
the
surface
sound
and
smooth
about
eight
feet
wide
the
whole
length
seen
at
once
and
when
you
are
at
one
end
the
other
end
seeming
to
be
hardly
a
yard
wide
when
we
got
about
we
found
a
road
that
crossed
this
these
roads
are
i
suppose
cut
for
the
hunters
they
are
very
pretty
at
any
rate
and
we
found
this
one
very
convenient
for
it
cut
our
way
short
by
a
full
half
mile
from
this
coppice
to
whitchurch
is
not
more
than
about
four
miles
and
we
soon
reached
it
because
here
you
begin
to
descend
into
the
in
which
this
little
town
lies
and
through
which
there
runs
that
which
turns
the
mill
of
portal
and
which
mill
makes
the
bank
of
england
talk
of
the
thames
and
the
hudson
with
their
forests
of
masts
talk
of
the
nile
and
the
delaware
bearing
the
food
of
millions
on
their
bosoms
talk
of
the
ganges
and
the
mississippi
sending
forth
over
the
world
their
silks
and
their
cottons
talk
of
the
rio
de
la
plata
and
the
other
rivers
their
beds
pebbled
with
silver
and
gold
and
diamonds
what
as
to
their
effect
on
the
condition
of
mankind
as
to
the
virtues
the
vices
the
enjoyments
and
the
sufferings
of
men
what
are
all
these
rivers
put
together
compared
with
the
of
which
a
man
of
threescore
may
jump
across
which
moistens
a
quarter
of
a
mile
wide
of
poor
rushy
meadow
which
washes
the
skirts
of
the
park
and
game
preserves
of
that
bright
patrician
who
wedded
the
daughter
of
hanson
the
attorney
and
late
solicitor
to
the
and
which
is
to
look
at
it
of
far
less
importance
than
any
gutter
in
the
wen
yet
this
river
by
merely
turning
a
wheel
which
wheel
sets
some
and
grinders
and
washers
and
in
motion
has
produced
a
greater
effect
on
the
condition
of
men
than
has
been
produced
on
that
condition
by
all
the
other
rivers
all
the
seas
all
the
mines
and
all
the
continents
in
the
world
the
discovery
of
america
and
the
consequent
discovery
and
use
of
vast
quantities
of
silver
and
gold
did
indeed
produce
great
effects
on
the
nations
of
europe
they
changed
the
value
of
money
and
caused
as
all
such
changes
must
transfer
of
raising
up
new
families
and
pulling
down
old
ones
a
transfer
very
little
favourable
either
to
or
to
real
and
but
this
cause
worked
its
consequences
came
on
by
slow
it
made
a
transfer
of
property
but
it
made
that
transfer
in
so
small
a
degree
and
it
left
the
property
quiet
in
the
hands
of
the
new
possessor
so
long
a
that
the
effect
was
not
violent
and
was
not
at
any
rate
such
as
to
uproot
possessors
by
whole
districts
as
the
hurricane
uproots
the
forests
not
so
the
product
of
the
little
sedgy
rivulet
of
whitchurch
it
has
in
the
short
space
of
a
hundred
and
years
and
indeed
in
the
space
of
the
last
caused
greater
changes
as
to
property
than
had
been
caused
by
all
other
things
put
together
in
the
long
course
of
seven
centuries
though
during
that
course
there
had
been
a
sweeping
confiscating
protestant
reformation
let
us
look
back
to
the
place
where
i
started
on
this
present
rural
ride
poor
old
baron
maseres
succeeded
at
reigate
by
little
parson
fellowes
and
at
betchworth
three
miles
on
my
road
by
kendrick
is
no
bad
instance
to
begin
with
for
the
baron
was
nobly
descended
though
from
french
ancestors
at
albury
fifteen
miles
on
my
road
drummond
a
banker
is
in
the
seat
of
one
of
the
howards
and
close
by
he
has
bought
the
estate
just
pulled
down
the
house
and
blotted
out
the
memory
of
the
godschalls
at
chilworth
two
miles
further
down
the
same
vale
and
close
under
martha
hill
tinkler
a
succeeding
hill
another
who
had
been
a
at
hounslow
has
got
the
old
mansion
and
the
estate
of
the
old
duchess
of
marlborough
who
frequently
resided
in
what
was
then
a
large
quadrangular
mansion
but
the
remains
of
which
now
serve
as
out
and
a
farmhouse
which
i
found
inhabited
by
a
poor
labourer
and
his
family
the
farm
being
in
the
hands
of
the
who
does
not
find
the
once
noble
seat
good
enough
for
him
coming
on
to
waverley
abbey
there
is
thompson
a
merchant
succeeding
the
orby
hunters
and
sir
robert
rich
close
adjoining
laing
a
west
india
dealer
of
some
sort
has
stepped
into
the
place
of
the
lineal
descendants
of
sir
william
temple
at
farnham
the
park
and
palace
remain
in
the
hands
of
a
bishop
of
winchester
as
they
have
done
for
about
eight
hundred
years
but
why
is
this
because
they
are
public
property
because
they
can
not
without
express
laws
be
transferred
therefore
the
product
of
the
rivulet
of
whitchurch
has
had
no
effect
upon
the
ownership
of
these
which
are
still
in
the
hands
of
a
bishop
of
winchester
not
of
a
william
of
wykham
to
be
sure
but
still
in
those
of
a
bishop
at
any
rate
coming
on
to
old
alresford
twenty
miles
from
farnham
sheriff
the
son
of
a
sheriff
who
was
a
commissary
in
the
american
war
has
succeeded
the
gages
two
miles
further
on
at
abbotston
down
on
the
side
of
the
itchen
alexander
baring
has
succeeded
the
heirs
and
successors
of
the
duke
of
bolton
the
remains
of
whose
noble
mansion
i
once
saw
here
not
above
a
mile
higher
up
the
same
baring
has
at
the
grange
with
its
noble
mansion
park
and
estate
succeeded
the
heirs
of
lord
northington
and
at
only
about
two
miles
further
sir
thomas
baring
at
stratton
park
has
succeeded
the
russells
in
the
ownership
of
the
estates
of
stratton
and
micheldover
which
were
once
the
property
of
alfred
the
great
stepping
back
and
following
my
road
down
by
the
side
of
the
meadows
of
the
beautiful
river
itchen
and
coming
to
easton
i
look
across
to
martyr
worthy
and
there
see
as
i
observed
before
the
ogles
succeeded
by
a
general
or
a
colonel
somebody
but
who
or
whence
i
can
not
learn
this
is
all
in
less
than
four
score
miles
from
reigate
even
to
this
place
where
i
now
am
oh
mighty
rivulet
of
whitchurch
all
our
properties
all
our
laws
all
our
manners
all
our
minds
you
have
changed
this
which
i
have
noticed
has
all
taken
place
within
forty
and
most
of
it
within
years
the
to
about
the
rank
upwards
considering
there
to
be
five
ranks
from
the
smallest
gentry
up
to
the
greatest
nobility
are
nearly
to
a
man
and
the
small
farmers
along
with
them
the
barings
alone
have
i
should
think
swallowed
up
thirty
or
forty
of
these
small
gentry
without
perceiving
it
they
indeed
swallow
up
the
biggest
race
of
all
but
innumerable
small
fry
slip
down
unperceived
like
caplins
down
the
throats
of
the
sharks
while
these
latter
only
the
codfish
it
frequently
happens
too
that
a
big
gentleman
or
nobleman
whose
estate
has
been
big
enough
to
resist
for
a
long
while
and
who
has
swilled
up
many
goes
down
the
throat
of
the
with
all
the
caplins
in
his
belly
thus
the
whitchurch
rivulet
goes
on
shifting
property
from
hand
to
hand
the
big
in
order
to
save
themselves
from
being
up
as
we
used
to
be
taught
to
say
in
our
church
prayers
against
buonaparte
make
use
of
their
to
get
through
place
pension
or
sinecure
something
back
from
the
taxers
others
of
them
in
with
the
and
of
people
big
brewers
and
the
like
and
sometimes
their
daughters
in
with
the
people
sons
or
the
fathers
of
those
sons
and
whether
they
be
or
not
seems
to
be
little
matter
with
this
passion
of
love
but
the
have
no
resource
while
lasted
war
there
was
a
resource
but
alas
not
only
is
there
no
war
but
there
is
hope
of
and
not
a
few
of
them
will
actually
come
to
the
there
is
no
place
for
them
in
the
army
church
navy
customs
excise
or
anywhere
else
all
these
are
now
wanted
by
their
a
family
will
not
look
at
such
penniless
things
so
that
while
they
have
been
the
active
the
zealous
the
efficient
instruments
in
compelling
the
working
classes
to
submit
to
they
have
at
any
rate
been
brought
to
the
most
abject
ruin
themselves
for
which
i
most
heartily
thank
god
the
harvest
of
war
is
never
to
return
without
a
total
blowing
up
of
the
spain
must
belong
to
france
domingo
must
pay
her
tribute
america
must
be
paid
for
slaves
taken
away
in
war
she
must
have
florida
she
must
go
on
openly
and
avowedly
making
a
navy
for
the
purpose
of
humbling
us
and
all
this
and
ten
times
more
if
france
and
america
should
choose
and
yet
we
can
have
as
long
as
the
last
and
if
then
is
to
sunday
morning
it
has
been
fine
all
the
week
until
when
we
intended
to
set
off
for
vulgarly
called
uphusband
but
the
rain
seems
as
if
it
would
stop
us
from
whitchurch
to
within
two
miles
of
this
place
it
is
the
same
sort
of
country
as
between
winchester
and
whitchurch
high
chalk
bottom
open
downs
or
large
fields
with
here
and
there
a
farmhouse
in
a
dell
sheltered
by
lofty
trees
which
to
my
taste
is
the
most
pleasant
situation
in
the
world
this
has
been
with
richard
one
whole
week
of
and
with
me
three
days
and
a
half
the
weather
has
been
amongst
the
finest
that
i
ever
saw
and
lord
caernarvon
preserves
fill
the
country
with
hares
while
these
hares
invite
us
to
ride
about
and
to
see
his
park
and
estate
at
this
fine
season
of
the
year
in
every
direction
we
are
now
on
the
north
side
of
that
beacon
hill
for
which
we
steered
last
sunday
this
makes
part
of
a
chain
of
lofty
and
downs
which
divides
all
the
lower
part
of
hampshire
from
berkshire
though
the
ancient
ruler
owner
of
the
former
took
a
little
strip
all
along
on
the
flat
on
this
side
of
the
chain
in
order
i
suppose
to
make
the
ownership
of
the
hills
themselves
the
more
clear
of
all
dispute
just
as
the
owner
of
a
and
bank
owns
also
the
ditch
on
his
neighbour
side
from
these
hills
you
look
at
one
view
over
the
whole
of
berkshire
into
oxfordshire
gloucestershire
and
wiltshire
and
you
can
see
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
sea
on
this
north
side
the
chalk
soon
ceases
and
the
sand
and
clay
begin
and
the
cover
a
great
part
of
the
surface
amongst
these
is
the
farmhouse
in
which
we
are
and
from
the
warmth
and
good
fare
of
which
we
do
not
mean
to
stir
until
we
can
do
it
without
the
chance
of
a
wet
skin
this
rain
has
given
me
time
to
look
at
the
newspapers
of
about
a
week
old
oh
oh
the
cotton
lords
are
tearing
thank
god
for
that
the
lords
of
the
anvil
are
snapping
thank
god
for
that
too
they
have
kept
poor
souls
then
in
a
heat
of
degrees
to
little
purpose
after
all
the
great
interests
mentioned
in
the
king
speech
do
not
all
continue
to
flourish
the
prosperity
was
not
then
permanent
though
the
king
was
advised
to
assert
so
positively
that
it
was
and
fall
in
price
and
the
chronicle
assures
me
that
the
respectable
owners
of
the
mexican
mining
shares
mean
to
take
measures
to
protect
their
indeed
like
the
spanish
bonds
i
suppose
will
the
chronicle
be
so
good
as
to
tell
us
the
names
of
these
persons
doctor
black
must
know
their
names
or
else
he
could
not
know
them
to
be
if
the
parties
be
those
that
i
have
heard
these
mining
works
may
possibly
operate
with
them
as
an
emetic
and
make
them
throw
up
a
part
at
least
of
what
they
have
taken
down
there
has
i
see
at
new
york
been
that
confusion
which
i
four
months
ago
said
would
and
must
take
place
that
breaking
of
merchants
and
all
the
ruin
which
in
such
a
case
spreads
itself
about
ruining
families
and
producing
fraud
and
despair
here
will
be
between
the
two
countries
an
interchange
of
cause
and
effect
proceeding
from
the
dealings
in
until
first
and
last
two
or
three
hundred
thousands
of
persons
have
at
one
spell
of
work
been
made
to
drink
deep
of
misery
i
pity
none
but
the
poor
english
creatures
who
are
compelled
to
work
on
the
wool
of
this
accursed
weed
which
has
done
so
much
mischief
to
england
the
slaves
who
cultivate
and
gather
the
cotton
are
well
fed
they
do
not
suffer
the
sufferers
are
these
who
spin
it
and
weave
it
and
colour
it
and
the
wretched
beings
who
cover
with
it
those
bodies
which
as
in
the
time
of
old
fortescue
ought
to
be
clothed
throughout
in
good
woollens
one
newspaper
says
that
huskisson
is
gone
to
paris
and
thinks
it
that
he
will
endeavour
to
inculcate
in
the
mind
of
the
bourbons
wise
principles
of
what
the
devil
next
persuade
them
i
suppose
that
it
is
for
that
english
goods
should
be
admitted
into
france
and
into
domingo
with
little
or
no
duty
persuade
them
to
make
a
treaty
of
commerce
with
him
and
in
short
persuade
them
to
make
help
to
pay
the
interest
of
our
debt
and
lest
our
system
of
paper
should
go
to
pieces
and
lest
that
should
be
followed
by
radical
which
reform
would
be
injurious
to
the
monarchical
principle
this
newspaper
politician
does
however
that
the
bourbons
will
be
too
dull
to
comprehend
these
and
notions
and
i
think
so
too
i
think
the
bourbons
or
rather
those
who
will
speak
for
them
will
say
no
thank
you
you
contracted
your
debt
without
our
participation
you
made
your
for
your
own
purposes
the
seizure
of
our
museums
and
the
loss
of
our
frontier
towns
followed
your
victory
of
waterloo
though
we
were
allies
at
the
time
you
made
us
pay
an
enormous
tribute
after
that
battle
and
kept
possession
of
part
of
france
till
we
had
paid
it
you
the
other
day
to
keep
us
out
of
spain
and
you
huskisson
in
a
speech
at
liverpool
called
our
deliverance
of
the
king
of
spain
an
and
unprincipled
act
of
while
canning
to
that
we
might
not
succeed
no
thank
you
huskisson
no
no
coaxing
sir
we
saw
then
too
clearly
the
we
derived
from
your
having
a
debt
and
a
dead
to
wish
to
assist
in
relieving
you
from
either
principle
here
or
principle
there
we
know
that
your
debt
is
our
best
security
we
like
to
have
your
wishes
your
prayers
and
your
abuse
against
us
rather
than
your
and
your
and
so
farewell
huskisson
if
you
like
the
english
may
drink
french
wine
but
whether
they
do
or
not
the
french
shall
not
wear
your
rotten
cottons
and
as
a
last
word
how
did
you
maintain
the
principle
the
principle
or
as
castlereagh
called
it
the
system
when
you
called
that
an
unjust
and
unprincipled
aggression
which
put
an
end
to
the
bargain
by
which
the
convents
and
other
of
spain
were
to
be
transferred
to
the
jews
and
jobbers
of
london

if
they
do
not
actually
say
this
to
him
this
is
what
they
will
think
and
that
is
as
to
the
effect
precisely
the
same
thing
it
is
childishness
to
suppose
that
any
nation
will
act
from
a
desire
of
all
other
nations
or
any
one
other
nation
as
well
as
it
will
make
unless
compelled
no
compact
by
which
it
does
not
think
itself
and
amongst
its
gains
it
must
and
always
does
reckon
the
injury
to
its
rivals
it
is
a
stupid
idea
that
nations
are
to
by
anything
whatever
is
the
gain
of
one
must
in
some
way
or
other
be
a
loss
to
another
so
that
this
new
project
of
free
trade
and
mutual
gain
is
as
pure
a
humbug
as
that
which
the
newspapers
carried
on
during
the
glorious
days
of
loans
when
they
told
us
at
every
loan
that
the
bargain
was
equally
advantageous
to
the
contractors
and
to
the
public
the
fact
is
the
free
trade
project
is
clearly
the
effect
of
a
of
our
as
long
as
we
felt
we
felt
we
had
no
thought
of
the
world
we
upheld
a
system
of
which
long
experience
proved
to
be
founded
in
but
we
now
find
that
our
debts
and
our
loads
of
various
sorts
cripple
us
we
feel
our
incapacity
for
the
of
trade
sword
in
and
so
we
have
given
up
all
our
old
maxims
and
are
endeavouring
to
persuade
the
world
that
we
are
anxious
to
enjoy
no
advantages
that
are
not
enjoyed
also
by
our
neighbours
alas
the
world
sees
very
clearly
the
cause
of
all
this
and
the
world
at
for
our
imaginary
cunning
my
old
doggrel
that
used
to
make
me
and
my
friends
laugh
in
long
island
is
precisely
pat
to
this
case
when
his
maw
was
stuffed
with
paper
how
john
bull
did
prance
and
caper
how
he
foam
and
how
he
roar
how
his
neighbours
all
he
gored
how
he
scrap
the
ground
and
dirt
and
filth
on
all
the
world
but
john
bull
of
paper
empty
though
in
midst
of
peace
and
plenty
is
modest
grown
as
sinner
as
scottish
laird
that
wants
a
dinner
as
wilberforce
become
content
a
rotten
burgh
to
represent
as
blue
and
buff
when
after
hunting
on
yankee
coasts
their
of
came
softly
back
across
the
seas
and
silent
were
as
mice
in
cheese
yes
the
whole
world
and
particularly
the
french
and
the
yankees
see
very
clearly
the
of
this
fit
of
modesty
and
of
liberality
into
which
we
have
so
recently
fallen
they
know
well
that
a
would
play
the
very
devil
with
our
national
faith
they
know
in
short
that
no
ministers
in
their
senses
will
think
of
supporting
the
through
another
war
they
know
well
that
no
ministers
that
now
exist
or
are
likely
to
exist
will
venture
to
endanger
the
and
therefore
they
know
that
for
england
they
may
now
do
just
what
they
please
when
the
french
were
about
to
invade
spain
canning
said
that
his
last
despatch
on
the
subject
was
to
be
understood
as
a
on
the
part
of
england
against
permanent
occupation
of
any
part
of
spain
by
france
there
the
french
are
however
and
at
the
end
of
two
years
and
a
half
he
says
that
he
knows
nothing
about
any
intention
that
they
have
to
quit
spain
or
any
part
of
it
why
saint
domingo
independent
we
had
traded
with
it
as
an
independent
state
is
it
not
clear
that
if
we
had
said
the
word
and
had
been
known
to
be
able
to
france
would
not
have
attempted
to
treat
that
fine
and
rich
country
as
a
colony
mark
how
wise
this
measure
of
france
how
too
to
obtain
by
means
of
a
tribute
from
the
domingoians
compensation
for
the
of
that
country
was
this
done
with
regard
to
the
loyalists
of
in
the
reign
of
the
good
jubilee
george
oh
no
those
loyalists
had
to
be
paid
and
many
of
them
have
even
yet
at
the
end
of
more
than
half
a
century
to
be
paid
out
of
taxes
raised
on
for
the
losses
occasioned
by
their
disinterested
loyalty
this
was
a
masterstroke
on
the
part
of
france
she
gets
about
seven
millions
sterling
in
the
way
of
tribute
she
makes
that
rich
island
yield
to
her
great
commercial
advantages
and
she
at
the
same
time
paves
the
way
for
effecting
one
of
two
objects
namely
getting
the
island
back
again
or
throwing
our
islands
into
confusion
whenever
it
shall
be
her
interest
to
do
it
this
might
have
been
prevented
by
from
us
if
we
had
been
ready
for
but
we
are
grown
we
are
grown
we
do
not
want
to
engross
that
which
fairly
belongs
to
our
neighbours
we
have
undergone
a
change
somewhat
like
that
which
marriage
produces
on
a
blustering
fellow
who
while
single
can
but
just
clear
his
teeth
this
change
is
quite
surprising
and
especially
by
the
time
that
the
second
child
comes
the
man
is
he
looks
like
a
loaded
man
his
voice
becomes
so
soft
and
gentle
compared
to
what
it
used
to
be
just
such
are
the
effects
of
but
the
worst
of
it
is
our
neighbours
are
thus
loaded
however
far
be
it
from
me
to
this
or
any
part
of
it
the
load
is
the
people
best
friend
if
that
could
if
that
could
be
shaken
off
leaving
the
and
the
parsons
in
their
present
state
i
would
not
live
in
england
another
day
and
i
say
this
with
as
much
seriousness
as
if
i
were
upon
my
the
wise
men
of
the
newspapers
are
for
a
repeal
of
the
with
all
my
heart
i
will
join
anybody
in
a
petition
for
their
repeal
but
this
will
not
be
done
we
shall
stop
short
of
this
extent
of
liberality
let
what
may
be
the
consequence
to
the
manufacturers
the
cotton
lords
must
all
go
to
the
last
man
rather
than
a
repeal
these
laws
will
take
place
and
of
this
the
newspaper
wise
men
may
be
assured
the
farmers
can
but
just
rub
along
now
with
all
their
high
prices
and
low
wages
what
would
be
their
state
and
that
of
their
landlords
if
the
wheat
were
to
come
down
again
to
or
even
shillings
a
bushels
universal
agricultural
bankruptcy
would
be
the
almost
instant
consequence
many
of
them
are
now
deep
in
debt
from
the
effects
of
and
one
more
year
like
would
have
broken
the
whole
mass
up
and
left
the
lands
to
be
cultivated
under
the
overseers
for
the
benefit
of
the
paupers
society
would
have
been
nearly
dissolved
and
the
state
of
nature
would
have
returned
the
bill
with
the
corn
laws
have
given
a
respite
and
nothing
more
this
bill
must
remain
must
cover
the
country
and
the
must
remain
in
force
or
an
equitable
adjustment
must
take
place
or
to
a
state
of
nature
this
country
must
return
what
then
as
a
repeal
of
the
and
also
to
get
rid
of
the
i
must
want
to
see
this
return
to
a
state
of
nature
by
no
means
i
want
the
equitable
adjustment
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
no
adjustment
can
be
which
does
not
apply
penny
worth
of
public
to
the
payment
of
the
and
and
the
like
clearly
just
and
reasonable
as
this
is
however
the
very
mention
of
it
makes
the
and
some
others
half
mad
it
makes
them
storm
and
rant
and
swear
like
bedlamites
but
it
is
curious
to
hear
them
talk
of
the
impracticability
of
it
when
they
all
know
that
by
only
two
or
three
acts
of
parliament
henry
viii
did
ten
times
as
much
as
it
would
now
i
hope
be
necessary
to
do
if
the
duty
were
imposed
no
statesman
legislator
or
lawyer
but
a
simple
citizen
i
think
i
could
in
less
than
hours
draw
up
an
act
that
would
give
satisfaction
to
i
will
not
say
but
to
at
least
out
of
every
hundred
an
act
that
would
put
all
affairs
of
money
and
of
religion
to
rights
at
once
but
that
would
i
must
confess
soon
take
from
us
that
amiable
of
which
i
have
spoken
above
and
which
is
so
conspicuously
shown
in
our
works
of
free
trade
and
liberality
the
weather
is
clearing
up
our
horses
are
saddled
and
we
are
off
ride
from
burghclere
to
petersfield
tarrant
or
uphusband
monday
november
we
came
off
from
burghclere
yesterday
afternoon
crossing
lord
caernarvon
park
going
out
of
it
on
the
west
side
of
beacon
hill
and
sloping
away
to
our
right
over
the
downs
towards
woodcote
the
afternoon
was
singularly
beautiful
the
downs
even
the
poorest
of
them
are
perfectly
green
the
sheep
on
the
downs
look
this
year
like
fatting
sheep
we
came
through
a
fine
flock
of
ewes
and
looking
round
us
we
saw
all
at
once
seven
flocks
on
different
parts
of
the
downs
each
flock
on
an
average
containing
at
least
sheep
it
is
about
six
miles
from
burghclere
to
this
place
and
we
made
it
about
twelve
not
in
order
to
avoid
the
but
because
we
do
not
ride
about
to
and
moreover
because
i
had
seen
this
most
monstrously
hilly
before
we
came
through
a
village
called
woodcote
and
another
called
binley
i
never
saw
any
inhabited
places
more
recluse
than
these
yet
into
these
the
eye
of
the
taxing
thing
reaches
its
exciseman
can
tell
it
what
is
doing
even
in
the
little
odd
corner
of
binley
for
even
there
i
saw
over
the
door
of
a
place
not
half
so
good
as
the
place
in
which
my
fowls
roost
to
deal
in
tea
and
poor
wretches
of
binley
the
hand
of
taxation
the
collection
for
the
sinecures
and
pensions
must
fix
its
nails
even
in
them
who
really
appeared
too
miserable
to
be
called
by
the
name
of
yet
there
was
one
whom
the
taxing
thing
had
licensed
good
god
to
serve
out
to
these
wretched
creatures
and
our
impudent
and
ignorant
newspaper
scribes
talk
of
the
state
of
the
people
of
impudent
impostors
can
they
show
a
group
so
wretched
so
miserable
so
truly
enslaved
as
this
in
all
spain
no
and
those
of
them
who
are
not
sheer
fools
know
it
well
but
there
would
have
been
misery
equal
to
this
in
spain
if
the
jews
and
jobbers
could
have
carried
the
into
effect
the
people
of
spain
were
through
the
instrumentality
of
patriot
within
an
inch
of
being
made
as
enlightened
as
the
poor
starving
things
of
binley
they
would
soon
have
had
people
licensed
to
make
them
pay
the
jews
for
permission
to
chew
tobacco
or
to
have
a
light
in
their
dreary
abodes
the
people
of
spain
were
preserved
from
this
by
the
french
army
for
which
the
jews
cursed
the
french
army
and
the
same
army
put
an
end
to
those
bonds
by
means
of
which
protestants
hoped
to
be
able
to
get
at
the
convents
in
spain
and
thereby
put
down
idolatry
in
that
country
these
bonds
seem
now
not
to
be
worth
a
farthing
and
so
after
all
the
spanish
people
will
have
no
one
licensed
by
the
jews
to
make
them
pay
for
turning
the
fat
of
their
sheep
into
candles
and
soap
these
poor
creatures
that
i
behold
here
their
lives
amidst
flocks
of
but
never
does
a
morsel
of
mutton
enter
their
lips
a
labouring
man
told
me
at
binley
that
he
had
not
tasted
meat
since
harvest
and
his
looks
vouched
for
the
statement
let
the
spaniards
come
and
look
at
this
poor
of
a
creature
and
then
let
them
estimate
what
is
due
to
a
set
of
enlightening
and
patriots
old
fortescue
says
that
the
english
are
clothed
in
good
woollens
throughout
and
that
they
have
plenty
of
flesh
of
all
sorts
to
eat
yes
but
at
this
time
the
nation
was
not
mortgaged
the
enlightening
patriots
would
have
made
spain
what
england
now
is
the
people
must
never
more
after
a
few
years
have
tasted
mutton
though
living
surrounded
with
flocks
of
sheep
near
winchester
wednesday
evening
i
intended
to
go
from
uphusband
to
stonehenge
thence
to
old
sarum
and
thence
through
the
new
forest
to
southampton
and
botley
and
thence
across
into
sussex
to
see
and
cowdry
house
but
then
there
must
be
no
loss
of
time
i
must
adhere
to
a
certain
route
as
strictly
as
a
regiment
on
a
march
i
had
written
the
route
and
laverstock
after
seeing
stonehenge
and
old
sarum
was
to
be
the
of
yesterday
tuesday
but
when
it
came
it
brought
rain
with
it
after
a
white
frost
on
monday
it
was
likely
to
rain
again
it
became
necessary
to
change
the
route
as
i
must
get
to
london
by
a
certain
day
and
as
the
first
day
on
the
new
route
brought
us
here
i
had
been
three
times
at
uphusband
before
and
had
as
my
readers
will
perhaps
recollect
described
the
bourn
here
or
the
it
has
in
general
no
water
at
all
in
it
from
august
to
march
there
is
the
bed
of
a
little
river
but
no
water
in
march
or
thereabouts
the
water
begins
to
boil
up
in
thousands
upon
thousands
of
places
in
the
little
narrow
meadows
just
above
the
village
that
is
to
say
a
little
higher
up
the
valley
when
the
chalk
hills
are
full
when
the
chalk
will
hold
no
more
water
then
it
comes
out
at
the
lowest
spots
near
these
immense
hills
and
becomes
a
rivulet
first
and
then
a
river
but
until
this
visit
to
uphusband
or
hurstbourne
tarrant
as
the
map
calls
it
little
did
i
imagine
that
this
rivulet
dry
half
the
year
was
the
head
of
the
river
teste
which
after
passing
through
stockbridge
and
rumsey
falls
into
the
sea
near
southampton
we
had
to
follow
the
bed
of
this
river
to
bourne
but
there
the
water
begins
to
appear
and
it
runs
all
the
year
long
about
a
mile
lower
down
here
it
crosses
lord
portsmouth
and
our
road
took
us
the
same
way
to
the
village
called
down
husband
the
scene
as
the
tells
us
of
so
many
of
that
noble
lord
ringing
and
exploits
here
we
crossed
the
london
and
andover
road
and
leaving
andover
to
our
right
and
whitchurch
to
our
left
we
came
on
to
long
parish
where
crossing
the
water
we
came
up
again
on
that
high
country
which
continues
all
across
to
winchester
after
passing
bullington
sutton
and
wonston
we
veered
away
from
and
came
across
the
fields
to
the
high
down
whence
you
see
winchester
or
rather
the
cathedral
for
at
this
distance
you
can
distinguish
nothing
else
clearly
as
we
had
to
come
to
this
place
which
is
three
miles
the
river
itchen
from
winchester
we
crossed
the
winchester
and
basingstoke
road
at
king
worthy
this
brought
us
before
we
crossed
the
river
along
through
martyr
worthy
so
long
the
seat
of
the
ogles
and
now
as
i
observed
in
my
last
register
sold
to
a
general
or
colonel
these
ogles
had
been
deans
i
believe
or
prebends
or
something
of
that
sort
and
the
one
that
used
to
live
here
had
been
and
was
when
he
died
an
admiral
however
this
last
one
sir
charles
the
loyal
address
mover
is
my
man
for
the
present
we
saw
down
by
the
opposite
to
sir
charles
family
mansion
a
beautiful
strawberry
garden
capable
of
being
watered
by
a
branch
of
the
itchen
which
comes
close
by
it
and
which
is
i
suppose
brought
there
on
purpose
just
by
on
the
greensward
under
the
shade
of
very
fine
trees
is
an
alcove
wherein
to
sit
to
eat
the
strawberries
coming
from
the
little
garden
just
mentioned
and
met
by
bowls
of
cream
coming
from
a
little
shaded
by
another
clump
a
little
lower
down
the
stream
what
delight
what
a
terrestrial
paradise
sir
charles
might
be
very
frequently
in
this
paradise
while
that
sidmouth
whose
bill
he
so
applauded
had
many
men
shut
up
in
loathsome
dungeons
ah
well
sir
charles
those
very
men
may
perhaps
at
this
moment
envy
neither
you
nor
sidmouth
no
nor
sidmouth
son
and
heir
even
though
clerk
of
the
pells
at
any
rate
it
is
not
likely
that
sir
charles
will
sit
again
in
this
paradise
contemplating
another
to
carry
to
a
county
meeting
ready
engrossed
on
parchment
to
be
presented
by
fleming
and
supported
by
lockhart
and
the
hampshire
parsons
i
think
i
saw
as
i
came
along
the
new
owner
of
the
estate
it
seems
that
he
bought
it
stock
and
fluke
as
the
sailors
call
it
that
is
to
say
that
he
bought
moveables
and
the
whole
he
appeared
to
me
to
be
a
keen
man
i
ca
find
out
where
he
comes
from
or
what
he
or
his
father
has
been
i
like
to
see
the
revolution
going
on
but
i
like
to
be
able
to
trace
the
parties
a
little
more
sir
charles
the
loyal
address
gentleman
lives
in
london
i
hear
i
will
i
think
call
upon
him
if
i
can
find
him
out
when
i
get
back
and
ask
how
he
does
now
there
is
one
hollest
a
george
hollest
who
figured
pretty
bigly
on
that
same
loyal
address
day
this
man
is
become
quite
an
inoffensive
harmless
creature
if
we
were
to
have
another
county
meeting
he
would
not
i
think
threaten
to
put
the
sash
down
upon
anybody
head
oh
peel
peel
peel
thy
bill
oh
peel
did
sicken
them
so
let
us
oh
thou
offspring
of
the
great
spinning
jenny
promoter
who
subscribed
ten
thousand
pounds
towards
the
late
glorious
war
who
was
after
that
made
a
baronet
and
whose
biographers
in
the
baronetage
tell
the
world
that
he
had
a
presentiment
that
he
should
be
the
founder
of
a
family
oh
thou
thou
great
peel
do
thou
let
us
have
only
two
more
years
of
thy
bill
or
oh
great
peel
minister
of
the
interior
do
thou
let
us
have
repeal
of
corn
bill
either
will
do
great
peel
we
shall
then
see
such
and
parsons
looking
so
queer
however
if
thou
wilt
not
listen
to
us
great
peel
we
must
perhaps
and
only
perhaps
wait
a
little
longer
it
is
sure
to
come
and
to
come
too
in
the
most
efficient
way
the
water
in
the
itchen
is
they
say
famed
for
its
clearness
as
i
was
crossing
the
river
the
other
day
at
avington
i
told
richard
to
look
at
it
and
i
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
it
very
clear
i
now
find
that
this
has
been
remarked
by
very
ancient
writers
i
see
in
a
newspaper
just
received
an
account
of
dreadful
fires
in
new
brunswick
it
is
curious
that
in
my
register
of
the
october
dated
from
chilworth
in
surrey
i
should
have
put
a
question
relative
to
the
the
huckleberries
or
the
raspberries
which
start
up
after
the
burning
down
of
woods
in
america
these
fires
have
been
at
two
places
which
i
saw
when
there
were
hardly
any
people
in
the
whole
country
and
if
there
never
had
been
any
people
there
to
this
day
it
would
have
been
a
good
thing
for
england
those
colonies
are
a
dead
expense
without
a
possibility
of
their
ever
being
of
any
use
there
are
i
see
a
church
and
a
barrack
destroyed
and
why
a
barrack
what
were
there
bayonets
wanted
already
to
keep
the
people
in
order
for
as
to
an
where
was
he
to
come
from
and
if
there
really
be
an
enemy
anywhere
there
about
would
it
not
be
a
wise
way
to
leave
the
worthless
country
to
him
to
use
it
after
his
own
way
i
was
at
that
very
fredericton
where
they
say
thirty
houses
and
barns
have
now
been
burnt
i
can
remember
when
there
was
no
more
thought
of
there
ever
being
a
barn
there
than
there
is
now
thought
of
there
being
economy
in
our
government
the
english
money
used
to
be
spent
prettily
in
that
country
what
do
want
with
armies
and
barracks
and
chaplains
in
those
woods
what
does
anybody
want
with
them
but
above
all
the
rest
of
the
world
there
is
nothing
there
no
house
no
barrack
no
wharf
nothing
but
what
is
bought
with
taxes
raised
on
the
people
of
england
what
do
want
with
these
wildernesses
ah
but
they
are
wanted
by
creatures
who
will
not
work
in
england
and
whom
this
fine
system
of
ours
sends
out
into
those
woods
to
live
in
idleness
upon
the
fruit
of
english
labour
the
soldier
the
commissary
the
all
the
whole
tribe
no
matter
under
what
what
keeps
them
they
are
paid
by
government
and
i
wish
that
we
constantly
bore
in
mind
that
the
government
pays
money
it
is
to
be
sure
sorrowful
to
hear
of
such
fires
and
such
dreadful
effects
proceeding
from
them
but
to
me
it
is
beyond
all
measure
to
see
labourers
of
england
worse
fed
than
the
convicts
in
the
and
i
know
very
well
that
these
worthless
and
jobbing
colonies
have
assisted
to
bring
england
into
this
horrible
state
the
honest
labouring
man
is
allowed
aye
by
the
magistrates
less
food
than
the
felon
in
the
gaol
and
the
felon
is
clothed
and
has
fuel
and
the
labouring
man
has
nothing
allowed
for
these
these
worthless
colonies
which
find
places
for
people
that
the
thing
provides
for
have
helped
to
produce
this
dreadful
state
in
england
therefore
any
the
sufferers
should
never
have
from
me
while
i
could
find
an
honest
and
industrious
english
labourer
unloaded
with
a
family
too
fed
worse
than
a
felon
in
the
gaols
and
this
i
can
find
in
every
part
of
the
country
friday
evening
we
lost
another
day
at
easton
the
whole
of
yesterday
it
having
rained
the
whole
day
so
that
we
could
not
have
come
an
inch
but
in
the
wet
we
started
therefore
this
morning
coming
through
the
duke
of
buckingham
park
at
avington
which
is
close
by
easton
and
on
the
same
side
of
the
itchen
this
is
a
very
beautiful
place
the
house
is
close
down
at
the
edge
of
the
meadow
land
there
is
a
lawn
before
it
and
a
pond
supplied
by
the
itchen
at
the
end
of
the
lawn
and
bounded
by
the
park
on
the
other
side
the
high
road
through
the
park
goes
very
near
to
this
water
and
we
saw
thousands
of
in
the
pond
or
sitting
round
on
the
green
edges
of
it
while
on
one
side
of
the
pond
the
hares
and
pheasants
were
moving
about
upon
a
gravel
walk
on
the
side
of
a
very
fine
plantation
we
looked
down
upon
all
this
from
a
rising
ground
and
the
water
like
a
showed
us
the
trees
and
even
the
animals
this
is
certainly
one
of
the
very
prettiest
spots
in
the
world
the
wild
seem
to
take
particular
delight
in
this
place
there
are
a
great
many
at
lord
caernarvon
but
there
the
water
is
much
larger
and
the
ground
and
wood
about
it
comparatively
rude
and
coarse
here
at
avington
everything
is
in
such
beautiful
order
the
lawn
before
the
house
is
of
the
finest
green
and
most
neatly
kept
and
the
edge
of
the
pond
which
is
of
several
acres
is
as
smooth
as
if
it
formed
part
of
a
to
see
so
many
in
a
situation
where
everything
is
in
the
has
a
most
pleasant
effect
on
the
mind
and
richard
and
i
like
pope
cock
in
the
farmyard
could
not
help
the
duke
and
duchess
for
having
generously
made
such
ample
provision
for
our
pleasure
and
that
too
merely
to
please
us
as
we
were
passing
along
now
this
is
the
advantage
of
going
about
on
on
foot
the
fatigue
is
too
great
and
you
go
too
slowly
in
any
sort
of
carriage
you
can
not
get
into
the
country
to
travel
in
stage
coaches
is
to
be
hurried
along
by
force
in
a
box
with
an
in
it
and
constantly
exposed
to
broken
limbs
the
being
much
greater
than
that
of
and
the
much
more
disagreeable
while
the
is
frequently
not
a
great
deal
more
to
one
liking
from
this
beautiful
spot
we
had
to
mount
gradually
the
downs
to
the
southward
but
it
is
impossible
to
quit
the
vale
of
the
itchen
without
one
more
look
back
at
it
to
form
a
just
estimate
of
its
real
value
and
that
of
the
lands
near
it
it
is
only
necessary
to
know
that
from
its
source
at
bishop
sutton
this
river
has
on
its
two
banks
in
the
distance
of
nine
miles
before
it
reaches
winchester
thirteen
parish
churches
there
must
have
been
some
to
erect
these
churches
it
is
not
true
then
that
pitt
and
george
iii
the
english
notwithstanding
all
that
the
scotch
are
ready
to
swear
about
the
matter
in
short
there
can
be
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
rational
man
that
in
the
time
of
the
plantagenets
england
was
out
of
all
comparison
more
populous
than
it
is
now
when
we
began
to
get
up
towards
the
downs
we
to
our
great
surprise
saw
them
covered
with
sad
times
coming
on
for
poor
sir
glory
said
i
to
richard
why
said
dick
it
was
too
cold
to
talk
much
and
besides
a
great
sluggishness
in
his
horse
made
us
both
rather
serious
the
horse
had
been
too
hard
ridden
at
burghclere
and
had
got
cold
this
made
us
change
our
route
again
and
instead
of
going
over
the
downs
towards
hambledon
in
our
way
to
see
the
park
and
the
innumerable
hares
and
pheasants
of
sir
harry
featherstone
we
pulled
away
more
to
the
left
to
go
through
bramdean
and
so
on
to
petersfield
contracting
greatly
our
intended
circuit
and
besides
i
had
never
seen
bramdean
the
spot
on
which
it
is
said
alfred
fought
his
last
great
and
glorious
battle
with
the
danes
a
fine
country
for
a
battle
sure
enough
we
stopped
at
the
village
to
bait
our
horses
and
while
we
were
in
the
an
exciseman
came
and
rummaged
it
all
over
taking
an
account
of
the
various
sorts
of
liquor
in
it
having
the
air
of
a
complete
master
of
the
premises
while
a
very
pretty
and
modest
girl
waited
on
him
to
produce
the
divers
bottles
jars
and
kegs
i
wonder
whether
alfred
had
a
thought
of
anything
like
this
when
he
was
clearing
england
from
her
oppressors
a
little
to
our
right
as
we
came
along
we
left
the
village
of
kingston
where
græme
once
lived
as
was
before
related
here
too
lived
a
ridge
a
famous
at
a
great
mansion
now
used
as
a
farmhouse
and
it
is
curious
enough
that
this
one
gunner
an
attorney
at
bishop
waltham
is
steward
to
the
man
who
now
owns
the
estate
before
we
got
to
petersfield
we
called
at
an
old
friend
and
got
some
bread
and
cheese
and
small
beer
which
we
preferred
to
strong
in
approaching
petersfield
we
began
to
descend
from
the
high
which
with
the
exception
of
the
valleys
of
the
itchen
and
the
teste
had
lasted
us
from
uphusband
almost
the
point
of
the
county
to
this
place
which
is
not
far
from
the
point
of
it
here
we
quit
flint
and
chalk
and
downs
and
take
to
sand
clay
hedges
and
coppices
and
here
on
the
verge
of
hampshire
we
begin
again
to
see
those
endless
little
hills
that
we
before
saw
round
the
foot
of
hindhead
we
have
got
in
in
very
good
time
and
got
at
the
dolphin
good
stabling
for
our
horses
the
waiters
and
people
at
inns
so
hard
at
to
see
us
so
liberal
as
to
fire
candle
beds
and
room
while
we
are
so
very
very
sparing
in
the
article
of
they
seem
to
pity
our
taste
i
hear
people
complain
of
the
exorbitant
charges
at
inns
but
my
wonder
always
is
how
the
people
can
live
with
charging
so
little
except
in
one
single
instance
i
have
uniformly
since
i
have
been
from
home
thought
the
charges
too
low
for
people
to
live
by
this
long
evening
has
given
me
time
to
look
at
the
star
newspaper
of
last
night
and
i
see
that
with
all
possible
desire
to
disguise
the
fact
there
is
a
great
brewing
it
is
impossible
that
this
thing
can
go
on
in
its
present
way
for
any
length
of
time
the
talk
about
speculations
that
is
to
say
adventurous
dealings
or
rather
commercial
gamblings
the
talk
about
having
been
the
cause
of
the
breakings
and
the
other
symptoms
of
approaching
convulsion
is
the
most
miserable
nonsense
that
ever
was
conceived
in
the
heads
of
idiots
these
are
not
the
cause
is
the
that
last
brilliant
effort
of
the
joint
mind
of
van
and
castlereagh
that
bill
was
as
i
always
called
it
a
and
it
was
and
could
be
nothing
more
it
could
only
put
off
the
evil
hour
it
could
not
prevent
the
final
arrival
of
that
hour
to
have
proceeded
with
bill
was
indeed
to
produce
total
convulsion
the
land
must
have
been
surrendered
to
the
overseers
for
the
use
of
the
poor
that
is
to
say
without
an
equitable
adjustment
but
that
adjustment
as
prayed
for
by
kent
norfolk
hereford
and
surrey
might
have
taken
place
it
to
have
taken
place
and
it
must
at
last
take
place
or
convulsion
must
come
as
to
the
of
this
adjustment
is
it
not
most
distinctly
described
in
the
norfolk
petition
is
not
that
memorable
petition
now
in
the
journals
of
the
house
of
commons
what
more
is
wanted
than
to
act
on
the
prayer
of
that
very
petition
had
i
to
draw
up
a
petition
again
i
would
not
change
a
single
word
of
that
it
pleased
brougham
best
public
instructor
to
abuse
that
petition
and
it
pleased
daddy
coke
and
the
hickory
quaker
gurney
and
the
wise
to
calumniate
its
author
they
succeeded
but
their
success
was
but
shame
to
them
and
that
author
is
yet
destined
to
triumph
over
them
i
have
seen
no
london
paper
for
ten
days
until
and
i
should
not
have
seen
this
if
the
waiter
had
not
forced
it
upon
me
i
know
what
will
happen
by
or
thereabouts
and
as
to
the
manner
in
which
things
will
work
in
the
meanwhile
it
is
of
far
less
consequence
to
the
nation
than
it
is
what
sort
of
weather
i
shall
have
to
ride
in
one
thing
however
i
wish
to
observe
and
that
is
that
if
any
attempt
be
made
to
repeal
the
the
main
body
of
the
farmers
will
be
crushed
into
total
ruin
i
come
into
with
few
who
are
not
gentlemen
or
very
substantial
farmers
but
i
know
the
state
of
the
and
i
know
that
even
with
present
prices
and
with
labourers
fed
worse
than
it
is
with
of
the
farmers
and
of
this
fact
i
beseech
the
ministers
to
be
well
aware
and
with
this
fact
staring
them
in
the
face
with
that
other
horrid
fact
that
by
the
regulations
of
the
who
can
not
avoid
it
mind
the
honest
labourer
is
fed
worse
than
the
convicted
felon
with
the
breakings
of
merchants
so
ruinous
to
confiding
foreigners
so
disgraceful
to
the
name
of
england
with
the
thousands
of
industrious
and
creatures
reduced
to
beggary
by
with
panic
upon
panic
plunging
thousands
upon
thousands
into
despair
with
all
this
notorious
as
the
sun
at
will
they
again
advise
their
royal
master
to
tell
the
parliament
and
the
world
that
this
country
is
in
a
state
of
unequalled
prosperity
and
that
this
prosperity
must
be
permanent
because
the
great
interests
are
let
them
that
will
not
alter
the
i
had
been
for
several
weeks
saying
that
the
was
that
the
cause
of
it
must
lead
to
and
shocking
ruin
that
it
could
not
last
because
it
arose
from
causes
so
manifestly
that
in
short
it
was
the
but
poisonous
fruit
of
a
miserable
expedient
i
had
been
saying
this
for
several
weeks
when
out
came
the
king
speech
and
gave
me
and
my
doctrines
the
as
to
every
point
well
now
then
we
shall
rural
ride
from
petersfield
to
kensington
saturday
i
was
at
this
town
in
the
summer
of
when
i
crossed
sussex
from
worth
to
huntington
in
my
way
to
titchfield
in
hampshire
we
came
this
morning
from
petersfield
with
an
intention
to
cross
to
horsham
and
go
thence
to
worth
and
then
into
kent
but
richard
horse
seemed
not
to
be
fit
for
so
strong
a
bout
and
therefore
we
resolved
to
bend
our
course
homewards
and
first
of
all
to
fall
back
upon
our
resources
at
thursley
which
we
intend
to
reach
going
through
north
chapel
chiddingfold
and
brook
at
about
four
miles
from
petersfield
we
passed
through
a
village
called
rogate
just
before
we
came
to
it
i
asked
a
man
who
was
hedging
on
the
side
of
the
road
how
much
he
got
a
day
he
said
and
he
told
me
that
the
wages
was
a
day
for
the
man
a
gallon
loaf
a
week
for
the
rest
of
his
that
is
to
say
one
pound
and
two
and
a
quarter
ounces
of
bread
for
each
of
them
and
nothing
more
and
this
observe
is
short
of
the
bread
allowance
of
gaols
to
say
nothing
of
the
meat
and
clothing
and
lodging
of
the
inhabitants
of
gaols
if
the
man
have
full
work
if
he
get
his
a
day
the
whole
nine
shillings
does
not
purchase
a
gallon
loaf
each
for
a
wife
and
three
children
and
two
gallon
loaves
for
himself
in
the
gaols
the
convicted
felons
have
a
pound
and
a
half
each
of
bread
a
day
to
begin
with
they
have
some
meat
generally
and
it
has
been
found
absolutely
necessary
to
allow
them
meat
when
they
work
at
the
it
is
impossible
to
make
them
work
at
the
without
it
however
let
us
take
the
bare
allowance
of
bread
allowed
in
the
gaols
this
allowance
is
for
five
people
pounds
and
a
half
in
the
week
whereas
the
man
nine
shillings
will
buy
but
pounds
of
bread
and
this
observe
is
a
vast
deal
better
than
the
state
of
things
in
the
north
of
hampshire
where
the
gets
but
eight
shillings
a
week
i
asked
this
man
how
much
a
day
they
gave
to
a
young
able
man
who
had
no
family
and
who
was
compelled
to
come
to
the
for
work
observe
that
there
are
a
great
many
young
men
in
this
situation
because
the
farmers
will
not
employ
single
men
full
these
full
wages
being
wanted
for
the
married
man
family
just
to
keep
them
alive
according
to
the
calculation
that
we
have
just
seen
about
the
borders
of
the
north
of
hampshire
they
give
to
these
single
men
two
gallon
loaves
a
week
or
in
money
two
shillings
and
and
nothing
more
here
in
this
part
of
sussex
they
give
the
single
man
a
day
that
is
to
say
enough
to
buy
two
pounds
and
a
quarter
of
bread
for
six
days
in
the
week
and
as
he
does
not
work
on
the
sunday
there
is
no
allowed
for
the
sunday
and
of
course
nothing
to
eat
and
this
is
the
allowance
settled
by
the
magistrates
for
a
young
hearty
labouring
man
and
that
too
in
the
part
of
england
where
i
believe
they
live
better
than
in
any
other
part
of
it
the
poor
creature
here
has
a
day
for
six
days
in
the
week
to
find
him
food
clothes
washing
and
lodging
it
is
just
less
than
one
half
of
what
the
meanest
foot
soldier
in
the
standing
army
receives
besides
that
the
latter
has
clothing
candle
fire
and
lodging
into
the
bargain
well
may
we
call
our
happy
state
of
things
the
envy
of
surrounding
nations
and
the
admiration
of
the
world
we
hear
of
the
efforts
of
fry
buxton
and
numerous
other
persons
to
improve
the
situation
of
felons
in
the
gaols
but
never
no
never
do
we
catch
them
ejaculating
one
single
pious
sigh
for
these
innumerable
sufferers
who
are
doomed
to
become
felons
or
to
waste
away
their
bodies
by
hunger
when
we
came
into
the
village
of
rogate
i
saw
a
little
group
of
persons
standing
before
a
blacksmith
shop
the
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
surrounded
by
a
low
wall
the
earth
of
the
was
about
four
feet
and
a
half
higher
than
the
common
level
of
the
ground
round
about
it
and
you
may
see
by
the
nearness
of
the
church
windows
to
the
ground
that
this
bed
of
earth
has
been
made
by
the
innumerable
burials
that
have
taken
place
in
it
the
group
consisting
of
the
blacksmith
the
wheelwright
perhaps
and
three
or
four
others
appeared
to
me
to
be
in
a
deliberative
mood
so
i
said
looking
significantly
at
the
it
has
taken
a
pretty
many
thousands
of
your
to
raise
that
ground
up
so
high
yes
sir
said
one
of
them
and
said
i
for
about
nine
hundred
years
those
who
built
that
church
thought
about
religion
very
differently
from
what
we
do
yes
said
another
and
said
i
do
you
think
that
all
those
who
made
that
heap
there
are
gone
to
the
devil
i
got
no
answer
to
this
at
any
rate
added
i
they
never
worked
for
a
pound
and
a
half
of
bread
a
day
they
looked
hard
at
me
and
then
looked
hard
at
one
another
and
i
having
trotted
off
looked
round
at
the
first
turning
and
saw
them
looking
after
us
still
i
should
suppose
that
the
church
was
built
about
seven
or
eight
hundred
years
ago
that
is
to
say
the
present
church
for
the
first
church
built
upon
this
spot
was
i
dare
say
erected
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
if
i
had
had
time
i
should
have
told
this
group
that
before
the
protestant
reformation
the
labourers
of
rogate
received
a
day
from
michaelmas
to
a
day
from
to
michaelmas
except
in
harvest
and
time
when
able
labourers
had
a
day
and
that
at
this
time
bacon
was
so
much
as
a
halfpenny
a
and
moreover
that
the
parson
of
the
parish
maintained
out
of
the
tithes
all
those
persons
in
the
parish
that
were
reduced
to
indigence
by
means
of
old
age
or
other
cause
of
inability
to
labour
i
should
have
told
them
this
and
in
all
probability
a
great
deal
more
but
i
had
not
time
and
besides
they
will
have
an
opportunity
of
reading
all
about
it
in
my
little
book
called
the
of
the
protestant
from
rogate
we
came
on
to
trotten
where
a
twyford
is
the
squire
and
where
there
is
a
very
fine
and
ancient
church
close
by
the
house
i
saw
the
squire
looking
at
some
poor
devils
who
were
making
wauste
improvements
on
the
road
which
passes
by
the
door
he
looked
uncommonly
hard
at
me
it
was
a
scrutinizing
sort
of
look
mixed
as
i
thought
with
a
little
surprise
if
not
of
jealousy
as
much
as
to
say
i
wonder
who
the
devil
you
can
be
my
look
at
the
squire
was
with
the
head
a
little
on
one
side
and
with
the
cheek
drawn
up
from
the
left
corner
of
the
mouth
expressive
of
anything
rather
than
a
sense
of
inferiority
to
the
squire
of
whom
however
i
had
never
heard
speak
before
seeing
the
good
and
commodious
and
capacious
church
i
could
not
help
reflecting
on
the
intolerable
baseness
of
this
description
of
men
who
have
remained
mute
as
fishes
while
they
have
been
taxed
to
build
churches
for
the
convenience
of
the
and
the
first
their
estates
have
been
taxed
to
pay
interest
of
debts
contracted
with
these
and
to
make
wars
for
the
sale
of
the
goods
of
the
this
drain
upon
their
estates
has
collected
the
people
into
great
masses
and
now
the
same
estates
are
taxed
to
build
churches
for
them
in
these
masses
and
yet
the
tame
fellows
remain
as
silent
as
if
they
had
been
born
deaf
and
dumb
and
blind
as
towards
the
labourers
they
are
sharp
and
vigorous
and
brave
as
heart
could
wish
here
they
are
bold
as
hector
they
pare
down
the
wretched
souls
to
what
is
below
gaol
allowance
but
as
towards
the
taxers
they
are
gentle
as
doves
with
regard
however
to
this
squire
twyford
he
is
not
as
i
afterwards
found
without
some
little
consolation
for
one
of
his
sons
i
understand
is
like
squire
rawlinson
of
hampshire
police
justice
in
i
hear
that
squire
twyford
was
always
a
distinguished
champion
of
loyalty
what
they
call
a
staunch
friend
of
government
and
it
is
therefore
natural
that
the
government
should
be
a
staunch
friend
to
him
by
the
taxing
of
his
estate
and
paying
the
out
of
the
proceeds
the
people
have
been
got
together
in
great
masses
and
as
there
are
justices
wanted
to
keep
them
in
order
in
those
masses
it
seems
but
reasonable
that
the
squire
should
in
one
way
or
another
enjoy
some
portion
of
the
profits
of
keeping
them
in
order
however
this
can
not
be
the
case
with
every
loyal
squire
and
there
are
many
of
them
who
for
want
of
a
share
in
the
distribution
have
been
totally
extinguished
i
should
suppose
squire
twyford
to
be
in
the
second
rank
upwards
dividing
the
whole
of
the
proprietors
of
land
into
five
ranks
it
appears
to
me
that
pretty
nearly
the
whole
of
this
second
rank
is
gone
that
the
have
eaten
them
clean
up
having
less
mercy
than
the
cannibals
who
usually
leave
the
hands
and
the
feet
so
that
this
squire
has
had
pretty
good
luck
from
trotten
we
came
to
midhurst
and
having
baited
our
horses
went
into
cowdry
park
to
see
the
ruins
of
that
once
noble
mansion
from
which
the
countess
of
salisbury
the
last
of
the
plantagenets
was
brought
by
the
tyrant
henry
the
eighth
to
be
cruelly
murdered
in
revenge
for
the
integrity
and
the
other
great
virtues
of
her
son
cardinal
pole
as
we
have
seen
in
number
four
paragraph
of
the
history
of
the
protestant
reformation
this
noble
estate
one
of
the
finest
in
the
whole
kingdom
was
seized
on
by
the
king
after
the
possessor
had
been
murdered
on
his
scaffold
she
had
committed
no
crime
no
crime
was
proved
against
her
the
miscreant
thomas
cromwell
finding
that
no
form
of
trial
would
answer
his
purpose
invented
a
new
mode
of
bringing
people
to
their
death
namely
a
bill
brought
into
parliament
condemning
her
to
death
the
estate
was
then
granted
to
a
sir
anthony
brown
who
was
physician
to
the
king
by
the
descendants
of
this
brown
one
of
whom
was
afterwards
created
lord
montague
the
estate
has
been
held
to
this
day
and
poyntz
who
married
the
sole
remaining
heiress
of
this
family
a
miss
brown
is
now
the
proprietor
of
the
estate
comprising
i
believe
or
fifty
the
greater
part
of
which
are
in
this
neighbourhood
some
of
them
however
extending
more
than
twenty
miles
from
the
mansion
we
entered
the
park
through
a
great
iron
gateway
part
of
which
being
wanting
the
gap
was
stopped
up
by
a
hurdle
we
rode
down
to
the
house
and
all
round
about
and
in
amongst
the
ruins
now
in
part
covered
with
ivy
and
inhabited
by
innumerable
starlings
and
jackdaws
the
last
possessor
was
i
believe
that
lord
montague
who
was
put
an
end
to
by
the
celebrated
on
the
rhine
along
with
the
brother
of
sir
glory
these
two
sensible
worthies
took
it
into
their
heads
to
go
down
a
place
something
resembling
the
waterfall
of
an
overshot
mill
they
were
drowned
just
as
two
young
kittens
or
two
young
puppies
would
have
been
and
as
an
instance
of
the
truth
that
it
is
an
ill
wind
that
blows
nobody
good
had
it
not
been
for
this
sensible
enterprise
never
would
there
have
been
a
westminster
rump
to
celebrate
the
talents
and
virtues
of
pride
and
england
glory
it
was
this
lord
montague
i
believe
who
had
this
ancient
and
noble
mansion
completely
repaired
and
fitted
up
as
a
place
of
residence
and
a
few
days
or
a
very
few
weeks
at
any
rate
after
the
work
was
completed
the
house
was
set
on
fire
by
accident
i
suppose
and
left
nearly
in
the
state
in
which
it
now
stands
except
that
the
ivy
has
grown
up
about
it
and
partly
hidden
the
stones
from
our
sight
you
may
see
however
the
hour
of
the
day
or
night
at
which
the
fire
took
place
for
there
still
remains
the
brass
of
the
face
of
the
clock
and
the
hand
pointing
to
the
hour
close
by
this
mansion
there
runs
a
little
river
which
runs
winding
away
through
the
valleys
and
at
last
falls
into
the
arron
after
viewing
the
ruins
we
had
to
return
into
the
turnpike
road
and
then
enter
another
part
of
the
park
which
we
crossed
in
order
to
go
to
petworth
when
you
are
in
a
part
of
this
road
through
the
park
you
look
down
and
see
the
house
in
the
middle
of
a
very
fine
valley
the
distant
boundary
of
which
to
the
south
and
is
the
south
down
hills
some
of
the
trees
here
are
very
fine
particularly
some
most
magnificent
rows
of
the
spanish
chestnut
i
asked
the
people
at
midhurst
where
poyntz
himself
lived
and
they
told
me
at
the
in
the
park
which
lodge
was
formerly
the
residence
of
the
head
keeper
the
land
is
very
good
about
here
it
is
fine
rich
loam
at
top
with
clay
further
down
it
is
good
for
all
sorts
of
trees
and
they
seem
to
grow
here
very
fast
we
got
to
petworth
pretty
early
in
the
day
on
entering
it
you
see
the
house
of
lord
egremont
which
is
close
up
against
the
and
which
wall
bounds
this
little
vale
on
two
sides
there
is
a
sort
of
here
and
on
one
side
of
it
there
is
the
bust
of
charles
the
second
i
should
have
thought
but
they
tell
me
it
is
that
of
sir
william
wyndham
from
whom
lord
egremont
is
descended
but
there
is
much
more
capacious
and
magnificent
than
the
namely
the
bridewell
which
from
the
modernness
of
its
structure
appears
to
be
one
of
those
wauste
improvements
which
distinguish
this
age
this
structure
vies
in
point
of
magnitude
with
the
house
of
lord
egremont
itself
though
that
is
one
of
the
largest
mansions
in
the
whole
kingdom
the
bridewell
has
a
wall
round
it
that
i
should
suppose
to
be
twenty
feet
high
this
place
was
not
wanted
when
the
labourer
got
twice
as
much
instead
of
half
as
much
as
the
common
standing
soldier
here
you
see
the
true
cause
why
the
young
labouring
man
is
to
exist
upon
a
day
for
six
days
in
the
week
and
nothing
for
sunday
oh
we
are
a
most
free
and
enlightened
people
our
happy
constitution
in
church
and
state
has
supplanted
popery
and
slavery
but
we
go
to
a
bridewell
unless
we
quietly
exist
and
work
upon
a
day
sunday
to
our
great
delight
we
found
richard
horse
quite
well
this
morning
and
off
we
set
for
this
place
the
first
part
of
our
road
for
about
three
miles
and
a
half
was
through
lord
egremont
park
the
morning
was
very
fine
the
sun
shining
a
sharp
frost
after
a
foggy
evening
the
grass
all
white
the
twigs
of
the
trees
white
the
ponds
frozen
over
and
everything
looking
exceedingly
beautiful
the
spot
itself
being
one
of
the
very
finest
in
the
world
not
excepting
i
dare
say
that
of
the
father
of
saxe
cobourg
itself
who
has
doubtless
many
such
fine
places
in
a
very
fine
pond
not
far
from
the
house
and
close
by
the
road
there
are
some
little
artificial
islands
upon
one
of
which
i
observed
an
arbutus
loaded
with
its
beautiful
fruit
quite
ripe
even
more
thickly
than
any
one
i
ever
saw
even
in
america
there
were
on
the
side
of
the
pond
a
most
numerous
and
beautiful
collection
of
foreign
as
well
as
domestic
i
never
saw
so
great
a
variety
of
collected
together
in
my
life
they
had
been
ejected
from
the
water
by
the
frost
and
were
sitting
apparently
in
a
state
of
great
dejection
but
this
circumstance
has
brought
them
into
a
comparatively
small
compass
and
we
facing
our
horses
about
sat
and
looked
at
them
at
the
pond
at
the
grass
at
the
house
till
we
were
tired
of
admiring
everything
here
is
in
the
neatest
and
most
beautiful
state
endless
herds
of
deer
of
all
the
varieties
of
colours
and
what
adds
greatly
to
your
pleasure
in
such
a
case
you
see
comfortable
retreats
prepared
for
them
in
different
parts
of
the
woods
when
we
came
to
what
we
thought
the
end
of
the
park
the
told
us
that
we
should
find
other
walls
to
pass
through
we
now
entered
upon
woods
we
then
came
to
another
wall
and
there
we
entered
upon
farms
to
our
right
and
to
our
left
at
last
we
came
to
a
third
wall
and
the
gate
in
that
let
us
out
into
the
turnpike
road
the
here
told
us
that
the
whole
enclosure
was
miles
and
this
after
all
forms
probably
not
a
quarter
part
of
what
this
nobleman
possesses
and
is
it
wrong
that
one
man
should
possess
so
much
by
no
means
but
in
my
opinion
it
is
wrong
that
a
system
should
exist
which
compels
this
man
to
have
his
estate
taken
away
from
him
unless
he
throw
the
junior
branches
of
his
family
for
maintenance
upon
the
public
lord
egremont
bears
an
excellent
character
everything
that
i
have
ever
heard
of
him
makes
me
believe
that
he
is
worthy
of
this
princely
estate
but
i
can
not
forget
that
his
two
brothers
who
are
now
very
old
men
have
had
from
their
infancy
enormous
revenues
in
sinecure
places
in
the
west
indies
while
the
general
property
and
labour
of
england
is
taxed
to
maintain
those
west
indies
in
their
state
of
dependence
upon
england
and
i
can
not
forget
that
the
burden
of
these
sinecures
are
amongst
the
grievances
of
which
the
west
indians
justly
complain
true
the
taxing
system
has
taken
from
the
family
of
wyndham
during
the
lives
of
these
two
gentlemen
as
much
and
even
more
than
what
that
family
has
gained
by
those
sinecures
but
then
let
it
be
recollected
that
it
is
not
the
helpless
people
of
england
who
have
been
the
cause
of
this
system
it
is
not
the
fault
of
those
who
receive
a
day
it
is
the
fault
of
the
family
of
wyndham
and
of
such
persons
and
if
they
have
chosen
to
suffer
the
jews
and
jobbers
to
take
away
so
large
a
part
of
their
income
it
is
not
fair
for
them
to
come
to
the
people
at
large
to
make
up
for
the
loss
thus
it
has
gone
on
the
great
masses
of
property
have
in
general
been
able
to
take
care
of
themselves
but
the
little
masses
have
melted
away
like
butter
before
the
sun
the
little
gentry
have
had
not
even
any
disposition
to
resist
they
merit
their
fate
most
justly
they
have
vied
with
each
other
in
endeavours
to
ingratiate
themselves
with
power
and
to
obtain
compensation
for
their
losses
the
big
fishes
have
had
no
feeling
for
them
have
seen
them
sink
with
a
sneer
rather
than
with
compassion
but
at
last
the
cormorant
threatens
even
themselves
and
they
are
struggling
with
might
and
main
for
their
own
preservation
they
everywhere
most
liberally
take
the
or
the
jew
by
the
hand
though
they
hate
him
mortally
at
the
same
time
for
his
power
to
outdo
them
on
the
sideboard
on
the
table
and
in
the
equipage
they
seem
to
think
nothing
of
the
extinguishment
of
the
small
fry
they
hug
themselves
in
the
thought
that
they
escape
and
yet
at
times
their
minds
misgive
them
and
they
tremble
for
their
own
fate
the
country
people
really
gain
by
the
change
for
the
small
gentry
have
been
rendered
by
their
miseries
so
niggardly
and
so
cruel
that
it
is
quite
a
blessing
in
a
village
to
see
a
rich
jew
or
jobber
come
to
supplant
them
they
come
too
with
far
less
cunning
than
the
gentry
cunning
as
the
is
in
change
alley
i
defy
him
to
be
cunning
enough
for
the
country
people
brought
to
their
present
state
of
duplicity
by
a
series
of
cruelties
which
no
pen
can
adequately
describe
the
goes
from
london
with
the
of
upon
his
lips
at
any
rate
whereas
the
squire
takes
not
the
least
pains
to
disguise
the
hardness
of
his
heart
it
is
impossible
for
any
just
man
to
regret
the
sweeping
away
of
this
base
race
of
squires
but
the
sweeping
of
them
away
is
produced
by
causes
that
have
a
wider
extent
these
causes
reach
the
good
as
well
as
the
bad
all
are
involved
alike
like
the
pestilence
this
horrible
system
is
no
respecter
of
persons
and
decay
and
beggary
mark
the
whole
face
of
the
north
chapel
is
a
little
town
in
the
weald
of
sussex
where
there
were
formerly
kept
but
where
there
are
none
kept
now
and
here
is
another
complete
revolution
in
almost
every
country
town
the
houses
have
been
lessened
in
number
and
those
that
remain
have
become
comparatively
solitary
and
mean
the
guests
at
inns
are
not
now
gentlemen
but
who
from
being
called
at
the
inns
riders
became
travellers
and
are
now
commercial
gentlemen
who
go
about
in
instead
of
on
horseback
and
who
are
in
such
numbers
as
to
occupy
a
great
part
of
the
room
in
all
the
inns
in
every
part
of
the
country
there
are
probably
twenty
thousand
of
them
always
out
who
may
perhaps
have
on
an
average
throughout
the
year
three
or
four
thousand
ladies
travelling
with
them
the
expense
of
this
can
be
little
short
of
fifteen
millions
a
year
all
to
be
paid
by
the
who
consume
the
goods
and
a
large
part
of
it
to
be
drawn
up
to
the
wen
from
north
chapel
we
came
to
chiddingfold
which
is
in
the
weald
of
surrey
that
is
to
say
the
country
of
between
these
two
places
there
are
a
couple
of
pieces
of
that
famous
commodity
called
government
property
it
seems
that
these
places
which
have
extensive
buildings
on
them
were
for
the
purpose
of
making
gunpowder
like
most
other
of
these
enterprises
they
have
been
given
up
after
a
time
and
so
the
ground
and
all
the
buildings
and
the
monstrous
fences
erected
at
enormous
expense
have
been
sold
they
were
sold
it
seems
some
time
ago
in
lots
with
the
intention
of
being
pulled
down
and
carried
away
though
they
are
now
nearly
new
and
built
in
the
most
solid
substantial
and
expensive
manner
brick
walls
eighteen
inches
through
and
the
buildings
covered
with
lead
and
slate
it
appears
that
they
have
been
purchased
by
a
stovell
a
sussex
banker
but
for
some
reason
or
other
though
the
purchase
was
made
long
ago
government
still
holds
the
possession
and
what
is
more
it
keeps
people
there
to
take
care
of
the
premises
it
would
be
curious
to
have
a
complete
history
of
these
pretty
establishments
at
chiddingford
but
this
is
a
sort
of
history
that
we
shall
never
be
treated
with
until
there
be
somebody
in
parliament
to
rummage
things
to
the
bottom
it
would
be
very
easy
to
call
for
a
specific
account
of
the
cost
of
these
establishments
and
also
of
the
quantity
of
powder
made
at
them
i
should
not
be
at
all
surprised
if
the
concern
all
taken
together
brought
the
powder
to
a
hundred
times
the
price
at
which
similar
powder
could
have
been
purchased
when
we
came
through
chiddingfold
the
people
were
just
going
to
church
and
we
saw
a
carriage
and
pair
conveying
an
old
gentleman
and
some
ladies
to
the
churchyard
steps
upon
inquiry
we
found
that
this
was
lord
winterton
whose
name
they
told
us
was
turnour
i
thought
i
had
heard
of
all
the
lords
first
or
last
but
if
i
had
ever
heard
of
this
one
before
i
had
forgotten
him
he
lives
down
in
the
weald
between
the
gunpowder
establishments
and
horsham
and
has
the
reputation
of
being
a
harmless
good
sort
of
man
and
that
being
the
case
i
was
sorry
to
see
that
he
appeared
to
be
greatly
afflicted
with
the
gout
being
obliged
to
be
helped
up
the
steps
by
a
stout
man
however
it
is
as
broad
perhaps
as
it
is
long
a
man
is
not
to
have
all
the
enjoyments
of
making
the
gout
and
the
enjoyments
of
abstinence
too
that
would
not
be
fair
play
and
i
dare
say
that
lord
winterton
is
just
enough
to
be
content
with
the
consequences
of
his
enjoyments
this
chiddingfold
is
a
very
pretty
place
there
is
a
very
pretty
and
extensive
green
opposite
the
church
and
we
were
at
the
proper
time
of
the
day
to
perceive
that
the
modern
system
of
education
had
by
no
means
overlooked
this
little
village
we
saw
marching
towards
the
church
in
military
order
two
of
them
passed
us
on
our
road
the
boys
looked
very
hard
at
us
and
i
saluted
them
with
there
brave
boys
you
all
be
parsons
or
lawyers
or
doctors
another
school
seemed
to
be
in
a
less
happy
state
the
scholars
were
too
much
in
uniform
to
have
had
their
clothes
purchased
by
their
parents
and
they
looked
besides
as
if
a
little
more
victuals
and
a
little
less
education
would
have
done
as
well
there
were
about
twenty
of
them
without
one
single
tinge
of
red
in
their
whole
twenty
faces
in
short
i
never
saw
more
deplorable
looking
objects
since
i
was
born
and
can
it
be
of
any
use
to
expend
money
in
this
sort
of
way
upon
poor
creatures
that
have
not
half
a
bellyful
of
food
we
had
not
breakfasted
when
we
passed
them
we
felt
at
that
moment
what
hunger
was
we
had
some
bits
of
bread
and
meat
in
our
pockets
however
and
these
which
were
merely
intended
as
amounted
i
dare
say
to
the
allowance
of
any
of
these
poor
boys
for
the
day
i
could
with
all
my
heart
have
pulled
the
victuals
out
of
my
pocket
and
given
it
to
them
but
i
did
not
like
to
do
that
which
would
have
interrupted
the
march
and
might
have
been
construed
into
a
sort
of
insult
to
quiet
my
conscience
however
i
gave
a
poor
man
that
i
met
soon
afterwards
sixpence
under
pretence
of
rewarding
him
for
telling
me
the
way
to
thursley
which
i
knew
as
well
as
he
and
which
i
had
determined
in
my
own
mind
not
to
follow
we
had
now
come
on
the
turnpike
road
from
my
lord
egremont
park
to
chiddingfold
i
had
made
two
or
three
attempts
to
get
out
of
it
and
to
bear
away
to
the
to
get
through
the
to
thursley
but
i
was
constantly
prevented
by
being
told
that
the
road
which
i
wished
to
take
would
lead
me
to
haslemere
if
you
talk
to
ostlers
or
landlords
or
or
indeed
to
almost
anybody
else
they
mean
by
a
a
and
they
positively
will
not
talk
to
you
about
any
other
now
just
after
quitting
chiddingfold
thursley
lies
over
fine
woods
and
coppices
in
a
direction
or
thereabouts
and
the
turnpike
road
which
goes
from
petworth
to
godalming
goes
in
a
direction
i
was
resolved
be
the
consequences
what
they
might
not
to
follow
the
turnpike
road
one
single
inch
further
for
i
had
not
above
three
miles
or
thereabouts
to
get
to
thursley
through
the
woods
and
i
had
perhaps
six
miles
at
least
to
get
to
it
the
other
way
but
the
great
thing
was
to
see
the
interior
of
these
woods
to
see
the
stems
of
the
trees
as
well
as
the
tops
of
them
i
saw
a
lane
opening
in
the
right
direction
i
saw
indeed
that
my
horses
must
go
up
to
their
knees
in
clay
but
i
resolved
to
enter
and
go
along
that
lane
and
long
before
the
end
of
my
journey
i
found
myself
most
amply
compensated
for
the
toil
that
i
was
about
to
encounter
but
talk
of
toil
it
was
the
horse
that
had
the
toil
and
i
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
sit
upon
his
back
turn
my
head
from
side
to
side
and
admire
the
fine
trees
in
every
direction
little
bits
of
fields
and
meadows
here
and
there
shaded
all
over
or
nearly
all
over
by
the
surrounding
trees
here
and
there
a
labourer
house
buried
in
the
woods
we
had
drawn
out
our
luncheons
and
eaten
them
while
the
horses
took
us
through
the
clay
but
i
stopped
at
a
little
house
and
asked
the
woman
who
looked
very
clean
and
nice
whether
she
would
let
us
dine
with
her
she
said
yes
with
all
her
heart
but
that
she
had
no
place
to
put
our
horses
in
and
that
her
dinner
would
not
be
ready
for
an
hour
when
she
expected
her
husband
home
from
church
she
said
they
had
a
bit
of
bacon
and
a
pudding
and
some
cabbage
but
that
she
had
not
much
bread
in
the
house
she
had
only
one
child
and
that
was
not
very
old
so
we
left
her
quite
convinced
that
my
old
observation
is
true
that
people
in
the
woodland
countries
are
best
off
and
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
to
reduce
them
to
that
state
of
starvation
in
which
they
are
in
the
part
of
the
kingdom
here
is
that
great
blessing
abundance
of
fuel
at
all
times
of
the
year
and
particularly
in
the
winter
we
came
on
for
about
a
mile
further
in
these
clayey
lanes
when
we
renewed
our
inquiries
as
to
our
course
as
our
road
now
seemed
to
point
towards
godalming
again
i
asked
a
man
how
i
should
get
to
thursley
he
pointed
to
some
upon
a
hill
told
me
i
must
go
by
them
and
that
there
was
no
other
way
where
then
said
i
is
thursley
he
pointed
with
his
hand
and
said
right
over
those
woods
but
there
is
no
road
there
and
it
is
impossible
for
you
to
get
through
those
woods
thank
you
said
i
but
through
those
woods
we
mean
to
go
just
at
the
border
of
the
woods
i
saw
a
cottage
there
must
be
some
way
to
that
cottage
and
we
soon
found
a
gate
that
let
us
into
a
field
across
which
we
went
to
this
cottage
we
there
found
an
old
man
and
a
young
one
upon
inquiry
we
found
that
it
was
to
get
through
these
woods
richard
gave
the
old
man
threepence
to
buy
a
pint
of
beer
and
i
gave
the
young
one
a
shilling
to
pilot
us
through
the
woods
these
were
with
underwood
beneath
and
there
was
a
little
stream
of
water
running
down
the
middle
of
the
woods
the
annual
and
long
overflowings
of
which
has
formed
a
meadow
sometimes
a
rod
wide
and
sometimes
twenty
rods
wide
while
the
bed
of
the
stream
itself
was
the
most
serpentine
that
can
possibly
be
imagined
describing
in
many
places
nearly
a
complete
circle
going
round
for
many
rods
together
and
coming
within
a
rod
or
two
of
a
point
that
it
had
passed
before
i
stopped
the
man
several
times
to
sit
and
admire
this
beautiful
spot
shaded
in
great
part
by
lofty
and
oak
trees
we
had
to
cross
this
brook
several
times
over
bridges
that
the
owner
had
erected
for
the
convenience
of
the
at
last
we
came
into
an
which
had
been
planted
in
regular
rows
at
about
four
feet
distances
which
had
been
once
cut
and
which
was
now
in
the
state
of
six
growth
a
road
through
it
made
for
the
was
as
straight
as
a
line
and
of
so
great
a
length
that
on
entering
it
the
farther
end
appeared
not
to
be
a
foot
wide
upon
seeing
this
i
asked
the
man
whom
these
coppices
belonged
to
and
he
told
me
to
squire
leech
at
lea
my
surprise
ceased
but
my
admiration
did
not
a
piece
of
ordinary
coppice
ground
close
adjoining
this
and
with
no
timber
in
it
and
upon
just
the
same
soil
if
there
had
been
such
a
piece
would
at
ten
years
growth
be
worth
at
present
prices
from
five
to
seven
pounds
the
acre
this
coppice
at
ten
years
growth
will
be
worth
twenty
pounds
the
acre
and
at
the
next
cutting
when
the
stems
will
send
out
so
many
more
shoots
it
will
be
worth
thirty
pounds
the
acre
i
did
not
ask
the
question
when
i
afterwards
saw
leech
but
i
dare
say
the
ground
was
trenched
before
it
was
planted
but
what
is
that
expense
when
compared
with
the
great
the
permanent
profit
of
such
an
undertaking
and
above
all
things
what
a
convenient
species
of
property
does
a
man
here
create
here
are
no
tenants
rack
no
anxiety
about
crops
and
seasons
the
rust
and
the
mildew
never
come
here
a
man
knows
what
he
has
got
and
he
knows
that
nothing
short
of
an
earthquake
can
take
it
from
him
unless
indeed
by
attempting
to
vie
with
the
in
the
expense
of
living
he
enable
the
to
come
and
perform
the
office
of
the
earthquake
leech
father
planted
i
think
it
was
forty
acres
of
such
coppice
in
the
same
manner
and
at
the
same
time
he
the
ground
with
the
acorns
have
become
oak
trees
and
have
begun
and
made
great
progress
in
diminishing
the
value
of
the
ash
which
have
now
to
contend
against
the
shade
and
the
roots
of
the
oak
for
present
profit
and
indeed
for
permanent
profit
it
would
be
judicious
to
grub
up
the
oak
but
the
owner
has
determined
otherwise
he
can
not
endure
the
idea
of
destroying
an
oak
wood
if
such
be
the
profit
of
planting
ash
what
would
be
the
profit
of
planting
locust
even
for
poles
or
stakes
the
locust
would
outgrow
the
ash
as
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
gunter
plantation
more
than
three
to
one
i
am
satisfied
that
it
will
do
this
upon
any
soil
if
you
give
the
trees
fifteen
years
to
grow
in
and
in
short
that
the
locusts
will
be
trees
when
the
ash
are
merely
poles
if
both
are
left
to
grow
up
in
single
stems
if
in
coppice
the
locust
will
make
as
good
poles
i
mean
as
large
and
as
long
poles
in
six
years
as
the
ash
will
in
ten
years
to
say
nothing
of
the
superior
durability
of
the
locust
i
have
seen
locusts
at
knowles
at
thursley
sufficient
for
a
for
an
ordinary
with
only
five
years
growth
in
them
and
leaving
the
last
year
growth
to
be
cut
off
leaving
the
top
of
the
pole
of
an
inch
through
there
is
nothing
that
we
have
ever
heard
of
of
the
timber
kind
equal
to
this
in
point
of
quickness
of
growth
in
parts
of
the
county
where
are
not
wanted
espalier
stakes
wood
for
small
fencing
hedge
stakes
hurdle
stakes
as
the
people
call
them
are
always
wanted
and
is
it
not
better
to
have
a
thing
that
will
last
twenty
years
than
a
thing
that
will
last
only
three
i
know
of
no
english
underwood
which
gives
a
hedge
stake
to
last
even
i
should
think
that
a
very
profitable
way
of
employing
the
locust
would
be
this
plant
a
coppice
the
plants
two
feet
apart
thus
planted
the
trees
will
protect
one
another
against
the
wind
keep
the
side
shoots
pruned
off
at
the
end
of
six
years
the
coppice
if
well
planted
and
managed
will
be
at
the
very
least
twenty
feet
high
to
the
tips
of
the
trees
not
if
the
grass
and
weeds
are
suffered
to
grow
up
to
draw
all
the
moisture
up
out
of
the
ground
to
keep
the
air
from
the
young
plants
and
to
intercept
the
gentle
rains
and
the
dews
but
trenched
ground
planted
carefully
and
kept
clean
and
always
bearing
in
mind
that
hares
and
rabbits
and
young
locust
trees
will
never
live
together
for
the
hares
and
rabbits
will
not
only
bite
them
off
but
will
gnaw
them
down
to
the
ground
and
when
they
have
done
that
will
scratch
away
the
ground
to
gnaw
into
the
very
root
a
gentleman
bought
some
locust
trees
of
me
last
year
and
brought
me
a
dismal
account
in
the
summer
of
their
being
all
dead
but
i
have
since
found
that
they
were
all
eaten
up
by
the
hares
he
saw
some
of
my
refuse
some
of
those
which
were
too
bad
to
send
to
him
which
were
a
great
deal
higher
than
his
head
his
ground
was
as
good
as
mine
according
to
his
account
but
i
had
no
hares
to
fight
against
or
else
mine
would
have
been
all
dead
too
i
say
then
that
a
locust
plantation
in
pretty
good
land
well
managed
would
be
twenty
feet
high
in
six
years
suppose
it
however
to
be
only
fifteen
there
would
be
at
the
bottom
wood
to
make
two
locust
pins
for
two
locust
pins
at
the
bottom
of
each
tree
two
at
the
very
least
and
here
would
be
thousand
locust
pins
to
the
acre
probably
enough
for
the
building
of
a
gun
ship
these
pins
are
about
eighteen
inches
long
and
perhaps
an
inch
and
half
through
and
there
is
this
surprising
quality
in
the
wood
of
the
locust
that
it
is
just
as
hard
and
as
durable
at
five
or
six
growth
as
it
is
at
fifty
years
growth
of
which
i
can
produce
an
abundance
of
instances
the
which
i
brought
home
from
america
and
which
is
now
at
had
stood
as
a
stake
for
about
eight
and
twenty
years
as
certified
to
me
by
judge
mitchell
of
north
hampstead
in
long
island
who
gave
me
the
stake
and
who
said
to
me
at
the
time
now
are
you
really
going
to
take
that
crooked
miserable
stick
to
england
now
it
is
pretty
well
known
at
least
i
have
been
so
informed
that
our
government
have
sent
to
america
in
consequence
of
my
writings
about
the
locust
to
endeavour
to
get
locust
pins
for
the
navy
i
have
been
informed
that
they
have
been
told
that
the
american
government
has
bought
them
all
up
be
this
as
it
may
i
know
that
a
waggon
load
of
these
pins
is
in
america
itself
equal
in
value
to
a
waggon
load
of
barrels
of
the
finest
flour
this
being
undeniable
and
the
fact
being
undeniable
that
we
can
grow
locust
pins
here
that
i
can
take
a
seed
and
say
that
it
shall
produce
two
pins
in
seven
years
time
will
it
not
become
an
article
of
heavy
accusation
against
the
government
if
they
neglect
even
one
day
to
set
about
tearing
up
their
infernal
scotch
firs
and
larches
in
wolmer
forest
and
elsewhere
and
putting
locust
trees
in
their
stead
in
order
first
to
provide
this
excellent
material
for
and
next
to
have
some
fine
plantations
in
the
holt
forest
wolmer
forest
the
new
forest
the
forest
of
dean
and
elsewhere
the
only
possible
argument
against
doing
which
being
that
i
may
possibly
take
a
ride
round
amongst
their
plantations
and
that
it
may
be
everlastingly
recorded
that
it
was
i
who
was
the
cause
of
the
government
adopting
this
wise
and
beneficial
measure
i
am
disposed
to
believe
however
that
the
government
will
not
be
brutish
enough
obstinately
to
reject
the
advice
given
to
them
on
this
head
it
being
observed
however
that
i
wish
to
have
no
hand
in
their
proceedings
directly
or
indirectly
i
can
sell
all
the
trees
that
i
have
for
sale
to
other
customers
let
them
look
out
for
themselves
and
as
to
any
reports
that
their
creatures
may
make
upon
the
subjects
i
shall
be
able
to
produce
proofs
enough
that
such
reports
if
unfavourable
are
false
i
wrote
in
a
register
from
long
island
that
i
could
if
i
would
tell
insolent
castlereagh
who
was
for
making
englishmen
dig
holes
one
day
and
fill
them
up
the
next
how
he
might
put
something
into
those
but
that
i
would
not
tell
him
as
long
as
the
should
be
in
the
state
in
which
they
then
were
they
are
no
longer
in
that
state
i
thank
god
there
has
been
no
positive
law
to
alter
their
state
but
it
is
manifest
that
there
must
be
such
law
before
it
be
long
events
are
working
together
to
make
the
country
worth
living
in
which
for
the
great
body
of
the
people
is
at
present
hardly
the
case
above
all
things
in
the
world
it
is
the
duty
of
every
man
who
has
it
in
his
power
to
do
what
he
can
to
promote
the
creation
of
materials
for
the
building
of
ships
in
the
best
manner
and
it
is
now
a
fact
of
perfect
notoriety
that
with
regard
to
the
building
of
ships
it
can
not
be
done
in
the
best
manner
without
the
assistance
of
this
sort
of
wood
i
have
seen
a
specimen
of
the
locust
wood
used
in
the
making
of
furniture
i
saw
it
in
the
posts
of
a
and
any
thing
more
handsome
i
never
saw
in
my
life
i
had
used
it
myself
in
the
making
of
rules
but
i
never
saw
it
in
this
shape
before
it
admits
of
a
polish
nearly
as
fine
as
that
of
box
it
is
a
bright
and
beautiful
yellow
and
in
bedsteads
for
instance
it
would
last
for
ever
and
would
not
become
loose
at
the
joints
like
oak
and
other
perishable
wood
because
like
the
live
oak
and
the
red
cedar
no
worm
or
insect
ever
preys
upon
it
there
is
no
fear
of
the
quantity
being
too
great
it
would
take
a
century
to
make
as
many
plantations
as
are
absolutely
wanted
in
england
it
would
be
a
prodigious
creation
of
real
and
solid
wealth
not
such
a
creation
as
that
of
paper
money
which
only
takes
the
dinner
from
one
man
and
gives
it
to
another
which
only
gives
an
unnatural
swell
to
a
city
or
a
watering
place
by
beggaring
a
thousand
villages
but
it
would
be
a
creation
of
money
worth
things
let
any
man
go
and
look
at
a
farmhouse
that
was
built
a
hundred
years
ago
he
will
find
it
though
very
well
built
with
stone
or
brick
actually
falling
to
pieces
unless
very
frequently
repaired
owing
entirely
to
the
rotten
wood
in
the
the
the
plates
the
pins
the
door
frames
the
window
frames
and
all
those
parts
of
the
beams
the
joists
and
the
rafters
that
come
in
contact
with
the
rain
or
the
moisture
the
two
parts
of
a
park
pailing
which
give
way
first
are
the
parts
of
the
post
that
meet
the
ground
and
the
pins
which
hold
the
rails
to
the
post
both
these
rot
long
before
the
pailing
rots
now
all
this
is
avoided
by
the
use
of
locust
as
sills
as
joists
as
posts
as
frames
and
as
pins
many
a
roof
has
come
down
merely
from
the
rotting
of
the
pins
the
best
of
spine
oak
is
generally
chosen
for
these
pins
but
after
a
time
the
air
gets
into
the
the
pin
rots
from
the
moist
air
it
gives
way
the
wind
shakes
the
roof
and
down
it
comes
or
it
swags
the
wet
gets
in
and
the
house
is
rotten
in
ships
the
pins
are
the
first
things
that
give
way
many
a
ship
would
last
twenty
years
after
it
is
broken
up
if
put
together
with
locust
pins
i
am
aware
that
some
readers
will
become
tired
of
this
subject
and
nothing
but
my
conviction
of
its
being
of
the
very
first
importance
to
the
whole
kingdom
could
make
me
thus
dwell
upon
it
we
got
to
thursley
after
our
beautiful
ride
through
coppices
and
the
weather
being
pretty
cold
we
found
ourselves
most
happily
situated
here
by
the
side
of
an
making
extremely
comfortable
a
room
which
was
formerly
amongst
the
most
uncomfortable
in
the
world
this
is
another
of
what
the
malignant
parsons
call
cobbett
quackeries
but
my
real
opinion
is
that
the
whole
body
of
them
all
put
together
have
never
since
they
were
born
conferred
so
much
benefit
upon
the
country
as
i
have
conferred
upon
it
by
introducing
this
judson
of
kensington
who
is
the
manufacturer
of
them
tells
me
that
he
has
a
great
demand
which
gives
me
much
pleasure
but
really
coming
to
conscience
no
man
ought
to
sit
by
one
of
these
that
does
not
go
the
full
length
with
me
both
in
politics
and
religion
it
is
not
fair
for
them
to
enjoy
the
warmth
without
subscribing
to
the
doctrines
of
the
giver
of
the
warmth
however
as
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
judson
affair
either
as
to
the
profit
or
the
loss
he
must
sell
the
to
whomsoever
he
pleases
sunday
coming
to
godalming
on
friday
where
business
kept
us
that
night
we
had
to
experience
at
the
inn
the
want
of
our
american
a
large
and
long
room
to
sit
in
with
a
miserable
thing
called
a
screen
to
keep
the
wind
from
our
backs
with
a
smoke
in
the
room
half
an
hour
after
the
fire
was
lighted
we
consuming
a
full
bushel
of
coals
in
order
to
keep
us
warm
were
not
half
so
well
off
as
we
should
have
been
in
the
same
room
and
without
any
screen
and
with
two
gallons
of
coals
if
we
had
our
american
i
gave
the
landlord
my
advice
upon
the
subject
and
he
said
he
would
go
and
look
at
the
at
knowles
that
was
precisely
one
of
those
rooms
which
stand
in
absolute
need
of
such
a
it
is
i
should
think
or
forty
feet
long
and
pretty
nearly
twenty
feet
wide
i
could
sooner
dine
with
a
labouring
man
upon
his
allowance
of
bread
such
as
i
have
mentioned
above
than
i
would
in
winter
time
dine
in
that
room
upon
turbot
and
sirloin
of
beef
an
american
with
a
good
fire
in
it
would
make
every
part
of
that
room
pleasant
to
dine
in
in
the
coldest
day
in
winter
i
saw
a
where
the
owner
has
tortured
his
invention
to
get
a
little
warmth
for
his
guests
where
he
fetches
his
coals
in
a
waggon
from
a
distance
of
twenty
miles
or
thereabouts
and
where
he
consumes
these
coals
by
the
bushel
to
effect
that
which
he
can
not
effect
at
all
and
which
he
might
effect
completely
with
about
a
fourth
part
of
the
coals
it
looked
like
rain
on
saturday
morning
we
therefore
sent
our
horses
on
from
godalming
to
ripley
and
took
a
to
convey
us
after
them
being
shut
up
in
the
did
not
prevent
me
from
taking
a
look
at
a
little
snug
house
stuck
under
the
hill
on
the
road
side
just
opposite
the
old
chapel
on
which
house
was
not
there
when
i
was
a
boy
i
found
that
this
house
is
now
occupied
by
the
family
molyneux
for
ages
the
owners
of
losely
park
on
the
of
which
estate
this
house
stands
the
house
at
losely
is
of
great
antiquity
and
had
or
perhaps
has
attached
to
it
the
great
manors
of
godalming
and
chiddingfold
i
believe
that
sir
thomas
more
lived
at
losely
or
at
any
rate
that
the
molyneuxes
are
in
some
degree
descended
from
him
the
estate
is
i
fancy
theirs
yet
but
here
they
are
in
this
little
house
while
one
gunning
an
east
indian
i
believe
occupies
the
house
of
their
ancestors
at
send
or
sutton
where
webb
weston
inhabited
there
is
a
baron
somebody
with
a
de
before
his
name
the
name
is
german
or
dutch
i
believe
how
the
baron
came
there
i
know
not
but
as
i
have
read
his
name
amongst
the
of
the
for
the
county
of
surrey
he
must
have
been
born
in
england
or
the
law
has
been
violated
in
making
him
a
justice
of
the
peace
seeing
that
no
person
not
born
a
subject
of
the
king
and
a
subject
in
this
country
too
can
lawfully
hold
a
commission
under
the
crown
either
civil
or
military
nor
is
it
lawful
for
any
man
born
abroad
of
scotch
or
irish
parents
to
hold
such
commission
under
the
crown
though
such
commissions
have
been
held
and
are
held
by
persons
who
are
neither
subjects
of
the
king
nor
born
of
english
parents
abroad
it
should
also
be
known
and
borne
in
mind
by
the
people
that
it
is
unlawful
to
grant
any
pension
from
the
crown
to
any
foreigner
whatever
and
no
naturalization
act
can
take
away
this
disability
yet
the
whigs
as
they
call
themselves
granted
such
pensions
during
the
short
time
that
they
were
in
power
when
we
got
to
ripley
we
found
the
day
very
fine
and
we
got
upon
our
horses
and
rode
home
to
dinner
after
an
absence
of
just
one
month
agreeably
to
our
original
intention
having
seen
a
great
deal
of
the
country
having
had
a
great
deal
of
sport
and
having
i
trust
laid
in
a
stock
of
health
for
the
winter
sufficient
to
enable
us
to
withstand
the
suffocation
of
this
smoking
and
stinking
wen
but
richard
and
i
have
done
something
else
besides
ride
and
hunt
and
course
and
stare
about
us
during
this
month
he
was
eleven
years
old
last
march
and
it
was
now
time
for
him
to
begin
to
know
something
about
letters
and
figures
he
has
learned
to
work
in
the
garden
and
having
been
a
good
deal
in
the
country
knows
a
great
deal
about
farming
affairs
he
can
ride
anything
of
a
horse
and
over
anything
that
a
horse
will
go
over
so
expert
at
hunting
that
his
first
teacher
budd
gave
the
hounds
up
to
his
management
in
the
field
but
now
he
begins
to
talk
about
nothing
but
that
is
a
dangerous
thing
when
he
and
i
went
from
home
i
had
business
at
reigate
it
was
a
very
wet
morning
and
we
went
off
long
before
daylight
in
a
intending
to
have
our
horses
brought
after
us
he
began
to
talk
in
anticipation
of
the
sport
he
was
going
to
have
and
was
very
inquisitive
as
to
the
probability
of
our
meeting
with
which
gave
me
occasion
to
address
him
thus
is
a
very
fine
thing
and
very
proper
for
people
to
be
engaged
in
and
it
is
very
desirable
to
be
able
to
ride
well
and
to
be
in
at
the
death
but
that
is
not
all
that
is
not
everything
any
fool
can
ride
a
horse
and
draw
a
cover
any
groom
or
any
who
is
as
ignorant
as
the
horse
can
do
these
things
but
all
gentlemen
that
go
a
i
hope
god
will
forgive
me
for
the
lie
are
scholars
richard
it
is
not
the
riding
nor
the
scarlet
coats
that
make
them
gentlemen
it
is
their
scholarship
what
he
thought
i
do
not
know
for
he
sat
as
mute
as
a
fish
and
i
could
not
see
his
countenance
so
said
i
you
must
now
begin
to
learn
something
and
you
must
begin
with
arithmetic
he
had
learned
from
mere
play
to
read
being
first
set
to
work
of
his
own
accord
to
find
out
what
was
said
about
thurtell
when
all
the
world
was
talking
and
reading
about
thurtell
this
had
induced
us
to
give
him
robinson
crusoe
and
that
had
made
him
a
passable
reader
then
he
had
scrawled
down
letters
and
words
upon
paper
and
had
written
letters
to
me
in
the
strangest
way
imaginable
his
knowledge
of
figures
he
had
acquired
from
the
necessity
of
knowing
the
several
numbers
upon
the
barrels
of
seeds
brought
from
america
and
the
numbers
upon
the
doors
of
houses
so
that
i
had
pretty
nearly
a
blank
sheet
of
paper
to
begin
upon
and
i
have
always
held
it
to
be
stupidity
to
the
last
degree
to
attempt
to
put
into
children
who
are
too
young
to
reason
with
i
began
with
a
pretty
long
lecture
on
the
utility
of
arithmetic
the
absolute
necessity
of
it
in
order
for
us
to
make
out
our
accounts
of
the
trees
and
seeds
that
we
should
have
to
sell
in
the
winter
and
the
utter
impossibility
of
our
getting
paid
for
our
pains
unless
we
were
able
to
make
out
our
accounts
which
accounts
could
not
be
made
out
unless
we
understood
something
about
arithmetic
having
thus
made
him
understand
the
utility
of
the
thing
and
given
him
a
very
strong
instance
in
the
case
of
our
nursery
affairs
i
proceeded
to
explain
to
him
the
meaning
of
the
word
arithmetic
the
power
of
figures
according
to
the
place
they
occupied
i
then
for
it
was
still
dark
taught
him
to
add
a
few
figures
together
i
naming
the
figures
one
after
another
while
he
at
the
mention
of
each
new
figure
said
the
amount
and
if
incorrectly
he
was
corrected
by
me
when
we
had
got
a
sum
of
about
i
said
now
there
is
another
line
of
figures
on
the
left
of
this
and
therefore
you
are
to
put
down
the
and
carry
what
is
said
he
i
then
explained
to
him
the
and
the
of
this
and
he
perfectly
understood
me
at
once
we
then
did
several
other
little
sums
and
by
the
time
we
got
to
sutton
it
becoming
daylight
i
took
a
pencil
and
set
him
a
little
sum
upon
paper
which
after
making
a
mistake
or
two
he
did
very
well
by
the
time
we
got
to
reigate
he
had
done
several
more
and
at
last
a
pretty
long
one
with
very
few
errors
we
had
business
all
day
and
thought
no
more
of
our
scholarship
until
we
went
to
bed
and
then
we
did
in
our
fashion
a
great
many
lines
in
arithmetic
before
we
went
to
sleep
thus
we
went
on
mixing
our
riding
and
hunting
with
our
arithmetic
until
we
quitted
godalming
when
he
did
a
sum
very
nicely
in
of
falling
a
little
short
of
what
i
had
laid
out
which
was
to
make
him
learn
the
four
rules
in
whole
numbers
first
and
then
in
money
before
i
got
home
friends
houses
are
not
so
good
as
inns
for
executing
a
project
like
this
because
you
can
not
very
well
be
by
yourself
and
we
slept
but
four
nights
at
inns
during
our
absence
so
that
we
have
actually
stolen
the
time
to
accomplish
this
job
and
richard
journal
records
that
he
was
more
than
fifteen
days
out
of
the
coursing
or
hunting
nothing
struck
me
more
than
the
facility
the
perfect
readiness
with
which
he
at
once
performed
addition
of
money
there
is
a
which
boys
usually
learn
and
during
the
learning
of
which
they
usually
get
no
small
number
of
thumps
this
table
i
found
it
wholly
unnecessary
to
set
him
i
had
written
it
for
him
in
one
of
the
leaves
of
his
journal
book
but
upon
looking
at
it
he
said
i
do
want
this
because
you
know
i
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
by
that
is
right
said
i
you
are
a
clever
fellow
dick
and
i
shut
up
the
book
now
when
there
is
so
much
talk
about
education
let
me
ask
how
many
pounds
it
generally
costs
parents
to
have
a
boy
taught
this
much
of
arithmetic
how
much
time
it
costs
also
and
which
is
a
far
more
serious
consideration
how
much
mortification
and
very
often
how
much
loss
of
health
it
costs
the
poor
scolded
child
who
becomes
and
dull
for
all
his
merely
because
that
has
been
imposed
upon
him
as
a
task
which
he
ought
to
regard
as
an
object
of
pleasant
pursuit
i
never
even
once
desired
him
to
stay
a
moment
from
any
other
thing
that
he
had
a
mind
to
go
at
i
just
wrote
the
sums
down
upon
paper
laid
them
upon
the
table
and
left
him
to
tackle
them
when
he
pleased
in
the
case
of
the
the
learning
of
which
is
something
of
a
job
and
which
it
is
absolutely
necessary
to
learn
perfectly
i
advised
him
to
go
up
into
his
and
read
it
twenty
times
over
out
loud
every
morning
before
he
went
a
hunting
and
ten
times
over
every
night
after
he
came
back
till
it
all
came
as
pat
upon
his
lips
as
the
names
of
persons
that
he
knew
he
did
this
and
at
the
end
of
about
a
week
he
was
ready
to
set
on
upon
multiplication
it
is
the
irksomeness
of
the
thing
which
is
the
great
bar
to
learning
of
every
sort
i
took
care
not
to
suffer
irksomeness
to
seize
his
mind
for
a
moment
and
the
consequence
was
that
which
i
have
described
i
wish
clearly
to
be
understood
as
ascribing
nothing
to
extraordinary
ability
there
are
as
i
have
often
said
as
many
of
men
as
there
are
of
dogs
but
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
of
any
peculiarly
excellent
sort
and
i
have
never
discovered
any
indications
of
it
there
are
to
be
sure
sorts
that
are
naturally
stupid
but
the
generality
of
men
are
not
so
and
i
believe
that
every
boy
of
the
same
age
equally
healthy
and
brought
up
in
the
same
manner
would
unless
of
one
of
the
stupid
kinds
learn
in
just
the
same
sort
of
way
but
not
if
begun
to
be
thumped
at
five
or
six
years
old
when
the
poor
little
things
have
no
idea
of
the
utility
of
anything
who
are
hardly
sensible
beings
and
have
but
just
understanding
enough
to
know
that
it
will
hurt
them
if
they
jump
down
a
chalk
pit
i
am
sure
from
thousands
of
instances
that
have
come
under
my
own
eyes
that
to
begin
to
teach
children
before
they
are
capable
of
reasoning
is
the
sure
and
certain
way
to
enfeeble
their
minds
for
life
and
if
they
have
natural
genius
to
cramp
if
not
totally
to
destroy
that
genius
i
think
i
shall
be
tempted
to
mould
into
a
little
book
these
lessons
of
arithmetic
given
to
richard
i
think
that
a
boy
of
sense
and
of
age
equal
to
that
of
my
scholar
would
derive
great
profit
from
such
a
little
book
it
would
not
be
equal
to
my
verbal
explanations
especially
accompanied
with
the
other
parts
of
my
conduct
towards
my
scholar
but
at
any
rate
it
would
be
plain
it
would
be
what
a
boy
could
understand
it
would
encourage
him
by
giving
him
a
glimpse
at
the
reasons
for
what
he
was
doing
it
would
contain
principles
and
the
difference
between
principles
and
rules
is
this
that
the
former
are
persuasions
and
the
latter
are
commands
there
is
a
great
deal
of
difference
between
carrying
for
such
and
such
a
reason
and
carrying
because
you
carry
you
see
boys
that
can
cover
reams
of
paper
with
figures
and
do
it
with
perfect
correctness
too
and
at
the
same
time
can
give
you
not
a
single
reason
for
any
part
of
what
they
have
done
now
this
is
really
doing
very
little
the
rule
is
soon
forgotten
and
then
all
is
forgotten
it
would
be
the
same
with
a
lawyer
that
understood
none
of
the
principles
of
law
as
far
as
he
could
find
and
remember
cases
exactly
similar
in
all
their
parts
to
the
case
which
he
might
have
to
manage
he
would
be
as
profound
a
lawyer
as
any
in
the
world
but
if
there
was
the
slightest
difference
between
his
case
and
the
cases
he
had
found
upon
record
there
would
be
an
end
of
his
law
some
people
will
say
here
is
a
monstrous
deal
of
vanity
and
egotism
and
if
they
will
tell
me
how
such
a
story
is
to
be
told
without
exposing
a
man
to
this
imputation
i
will
adopt
their
mode
another
time
i
get
nothing
by
telling
the
story
i
should
get
full
as
much
by
keeping
it
to
myself
but
it
may
be
useful
to
others
and
therefore
i
tell
it
nothing
is
so
dangerous
as
supposing
that
you
have
eight
wonders
of
the
world
i
have
no
pretensions
to
any
such
possession
i
look
upon
my
boy
as
being
like
other
boys
in
general
their
fathers
can
teach
arithmetic
as
well
as
i
and
if
they
have
not
a
mind
to
pursue
my
method
they
must
pursue
their
own
let
them
apply
to
the
outside
of
the
head
and
to
the
back
if
they
like
let
them
bargain
for
thumps
and
the
birch
rod
it
is
their
affair
and
not
mine
i
never
yet
saw
in
my
house
a
child
that
was
that
was
in
any
fear
whatever
that
was
ever
for
a
moment
under
any
sort
of
apprehension
on
account
of
the
learning
of
anything
and
i
never
in
my
life
gave
a
command
an
order
a
request
or
even
advice
to
look
into
any
book
and
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
the
way
to
make
children
dunces
to
make
them
detest
books
and
justify
that
detestation
is
to
tease
them
and
bother
them
upon
the
subject
as
to
the
at
which
children
ought
to
begin
to
be
taught
it
is
very
curious
that
while
i
was
at
a
friend
house
during
my
ride
i
looked
into
by
mere
accident
a
little
child
abridgment
of
the
history
of
england
a
little
thing
about
twice
as
big
as
a
even
into
this
abridgment
the
historian
had
introduced
the
circumstance
of
alfred
father
who
through
a
of
kindness
to
his
son
had
suffered
him
to
live
to
the
age
of
twelve
years
without
any
attempt
being
made
to
give
him
education
how
came
this
writer
to
know
that
it
was
a
ought
he
not
rather
when
he
looked
at
the
result
when
he
considered
the
astonishing
knowledge
and
great
deeds
of
alfred
ought
he
not
to
have
hesitated
before
he
thus
criticised
the
notions
of
the
father
it
appears
from
the
result
that
the
notions
of
the
father
were
perfectly
correct
and
i
am
satisfied
that
if
they
had
begun
to
thump
the
head
of
alfred
when
he
was
a
child
we
should
not
at
this
day
have
heard
talk
of
alfred
the
great
great
apologies
are
due
to
the
old
lady
from
me
on
account
of
my
apparent
inattention
towards
her
during
her
recent
or
rather
i
may
say
her
present
fit
of
that
tormenting
disorder
which
as
i
observed
before
comes
upon
her
by
may
say
what
he
pleases
about
her
being
i
say
it
the
wet
gripes
and
i
saw
a
poor
old
mare
down
in
hampshire
in
just
the
same
way
but
god
forbid
the
catastrophe
should
be
the
same
for
they
shot
poor
old
ball
for
the
hounds
this
disorder
comes
by
spells
it
sometimes
seems
as
if
it
were
altogether
going
off
the
pulse
rises
and
the
appetite
returns
a
fresh
grumbling
begins
to
take
place
in
the
bowels
these
are
followed
by
acute
pains
the
patient
becomes
tremulous
the
pulse
begins
to
fall
and
the
most
gloomy
apprehensions
begin
again
to
be
entertained
at
every
spell
the
pulse
does
not
cease
falling
till
it
becomes
lower
than
it
was
brought
to
by
the
preceding
spell
and
thus
spell
after
spell
finally
produces
the
natural
result
it
is
useless
at
present
to
say
much
about
the
equivocating
and
blundering
of
the
newspapers
relative
to
the
cause
of
the
fall
they
are
very
shy
extremely
cautious
become
wonderfully
with
regard
to
this
subject
they
do
not
know
what
to
make
of
it
they
all
remember
that
i
told
them
that
their
prosperity
was
delusive
that
it
would
soon
come
to
an
end
while
they
were
telling
me
of
the
falsification
of
all
my
predictions
i
told
them
the
bill
had
only
given
a
i
told
them
that
the
foreign
loans
and
the
shares
and
all
the
astonishing
enterprises
arose
purely
out
of
the
bill
and
that
a
short
time
would
see
the
bill
driving
the
gold
out
of
the
country
and
bring
us
back
to
another
restriction
or
to
wheat
at
four
shillings
a
bushel
they
remember
that
i
told
them
all
this
and
now
some
of
them
begin
to
me
as
the
principal
cause
of
the
present
this
is
pretty
work
indeed
what
i
the
poor
deluded
creature
whose
predictions
were
all
falsified
who
knew
nothing
at
all
about
such
matters
who
was
a
perfect
pedlar
in
political
economy
who
was
a
conceited
and
obstinate
old
dotard
as
that
polite
and
enlightened
paper
the
called
me
is
it
possible
that
such
a
poor
miserable
creature
can
have
had
the
power
to
produce
effects
so
prodigious
yet
this
really
appears
to
be
the
opinion
of
one
at
least
of
these
brougham
best
possible
public
instructors
the
of
the
of
november
has
the
following
passage
it
is
fully
ascertained
that
the
country
banking
establishments
in
england
have
latterly
been
compelled
to
limit
their
paper
circulation
for
the
writings
of
cobbett
are
widely
circulated
in
the
agricultural
districts
and
they
have
been
so
successful
as
to
induce
the
to
call
for
gold
in
place
of
country
paper
a
circumstance
which
has
a
greater
effect
on
the
currency
than
any
exportation
of
the
precious
to
the
continent
either
of
europe
or
america
could
have
done
although
it
too
must
have
contributed
to
render
money
for
a
season
scarce
and
so
the
call
for
gold
instead
of
country
bless
the
i
wish
they
would
do
it
to
a
greater
extent
which
they
would
if
they
were
not
so
dependent
as
they
are
upon
the
ragmen
but
does
the
think
that
those
unfortunate
creatures
who
suffered
the
other
day
at
plymouth
would
have
been
if
they
had
gone
and
got
sovereigns
before
the
banks
broke
this
brother
of
the
broad
sheet
should
act
justly
and
fairly
as
i
do
he
should
ascribe
these
demands
for
gold
to
jones
of
bristol
and
not
to
me
jones
taught
the
boobies
that
they
might
have
gold
for
asking
for
or
send
the
ragmen
to
jail
it
is
jones
therefore
that
they
should
blame
and
not
me
but
seriously
speaking
what
a
mess
what
a
pickle
what
a
horrible
mess
must
the
thing
be
in
if
any
man
or
any
thousand
of
men
or
any
hundred
thousand
of
men
can
change
the
value
of
money
unhinge
all
contracts
and
all
engagements
and
plunge
the
pecuniary
affairs
of
a
nation
into
confusion
i
have
been
often
accused
of
wishing
to
be
thought
the
cleverest
man
in
the
country
but
surely
it
is
no
vanity
for
vanity
means
unjust
pretension
for
me
to
think
myself
the
cleverest
man
in
the
country
if
i
can
of
my
own
head
and
at
my
own
pleasure
produce
effects
like
these
truth
however
and
fair
dealing
with
my
readers
call
upon
me
to
disclaim
so
haughty
a
pretension
i
have
no
such
power
as
this
public
instructor
ascribes
to
me
greater
causes
are
at
work
to
produce
such
effects
causes
wholly
uncontrollable
by
me
and
what
is
more
wholly
uncontrollable
in
the
long
run
by
the
government
itself
though
heartily
with
the
bank
directors
these
united
can
do
nothing
to
arrest
the
progress
of
events
bill
produced
the
horrible
distresses
of
the
part
repeal
of
that
bill
produced
a
respite
that
respite
is
now
about
to
expire
and
neither
government
nor
bank
nor
both
joined
together
can
prevent
the
ultimate
consequences
they
may
postpone
them
for
a
little
but
mark
every
postponement
will
render
the
catastrophe
the
more
dreadful
i
see
everlasting
attempts
by
the
instructor
to
cast
blame
upon
the
bank
i
can
see
no
blame
in
the
bank
the
bank
has
issued
no
small
notes
though
it
has
liberty
to
do
it
the
bank
pays
in
gold
agreeably
to
the
law
what
more
does
anybody
want
with
the
bank
the
bank
lends
money
i
suppose
when
it
chooses
and
is
not
it
to
be
the
judge
when
it
shall
lend
and
when
it
shall
not
the
bank
is
blamed
for
putting
out
paper
and
causing
high
prices
and
blamed
at
the
same
time
for
not
putting
out
paper
to
accommodate
merchants
and
keep
them
from
breaking
it
can
not
be
to
blame
for
both
and
indeed
it
is
blameable
for
neither
it
is
the
fellows
that
put
out
the
paper
and
then
break
that
do
the
mischief
however
a
breaking
merchant
whom
the
bank
will
no
longer
prop
up
will
naturally
blame
the
bank
just
as
every
insolvent
blames
a
solvent
that
will
not
lend
him
money
when
the
foreign
loans
first
began
to
go
on
peter
and
all
the
scotch
were
cock
o
whoop
they
said
that
there
were
prodigious
advantages
in
lending
money
to
south
america
that
the
interest
would
come
home
to
enrich
us
that
the
amount
of
the
loans
would
go
out
chiefly
in
english
manufactures
that
the
commercial
gains
would
be
enormous
and
that
this
country
would
thus
be
made
rich
and
powerful
and
happy
by
employing
in
this
way
its
surplus
capital
and
thereby
contributing
at
the
same
time
to
the
uprooting
of
despotism
and
superstition
and
the
establishing
of
freedom
and
liberality
in
their
stead
unhappy
and
purblind
i
could
not
for
the
life
of
me
see
the
matter
in
this
light
my
perverted
optics
could
perceive
no
in
bundles
of
i
could
see
no
gain
in
sending
out
goods
which
somebody
in
england
was
to
pay
for
without
as
it
appeared
to
me
the
smallest
chance
of
ever
being
paid
again
i
could
see
no
chance
of
gain
in
the
purchase
of
a
bond
nominally
bearing
interest
at
six
per
and
on
which
as
i
thought
no
interest
at
all
would
ever
be
paid
i
despised
the
idea
of
paying
bits
of
paper
by
bits
of
paper
i
knew
that
a
bond
though
said
to
bear
six
per
cent
interest
was
not
worth
a
farthing
unless
some
interest
were
paid
upon
it
i
declared
when
spanish
bonds
were
at
that
i
would
not
give
a
crown
for
a
hundred
pounds
in
them
if
i
were
compelled
to
keep
them
unsold
for
seven
years
and
i
now
declare
as
to
south
american
bonds
i
think
them
of
less
value
than
the
spanish
bonds
now
are
if
the
owner
be
compelled
to
keep
them
unsold
for
a
year
it
is
very
true
that
these
opinions
agree
with
my
but
they
have
not
been
created
by
those
wishes
they
are
founded
on
my
knowledge
of
the
state
of
things
and
upon
my
firm
conviction
of
the
folly
of
expecting
that
the
interest
of
these
things
will
ever
come
from
the
respective
countries
to
which
they
relate
canning
despatch
which
i
shall
insert
below
has
doubtless
had
a
tendency
whether
expected
or
not
to
prop
up
the
credit
of
these
sublime
speculations
the
propping
up
of
the
credit
of
them
can
however
do
no
sort
of
good
the
keeping
up
the
price
of
them
for
the
present
may
assist
some
of
the
actual
speculators
but
it
can
do
nothing
for
the
speculation
in
the
end
and
this
speculation
which
was
wholly
an
effect
of
the
bill
will
finally
have
a
most
ruinous
effect
how
is
it
to
be
otherwise
have
we
ever
received
any
evidence
or
anything
whereon
to
build
a
belief
that
the
interest
on
these
bonds
will
be
paid
never
and
the
man
must
be
mad
mad
with
avarice
or
a
love
of
gambling
that
could
advance
his
money
upon
any
such
a
thing
as
these
bonds
the
fact
is
however
that
it
was
not
it
was
paper
it
was
borrowed
or
created
for
the
purpose
of
being
advanced
observe
too
that
when
the
loans
were
made
money
was
at
a
lower
value
than
it
is
now
therefore
those
who
would
have
to
pay
the
interest
would
have
too
much
to
pay
if
they
were
to
fulfil
their
engagement
state
paper
clearly
proves
to
me
that
the
main
object
of
it
is
to
make
the
loans
to
south
america
finally
be
paid
because
if
they
be
not
paid
not
only
is
the
amount
of
them
lost
to
the
but
there
is
an
end
at
once
to
all
that
brilliant
with
which
that
shining
minister
appears
to
be
so
much
enchanted
all
the
silver
and
gold
all
the
mexican
and
peruvian
dreams
vanish
in
an
instant
and
leave
behind
the
wretched
and
wretched
jews
and
jobbers
to
go
to
the
workhouse
or
to
botany
bay
the
whole
of
the
loans
are
said
to
amount
to
about
or
millions
it
is
supposed
that
twelve
millions
have
actually
been
sent
out
in
goods
these
goods
have
perhaps
been
paid
for
here
but
they
have
been
paid
for
out
of
english
money
or
by
english
promises
the
money
to
pay
with
has
come
from
those
who
gave
money
for
the
south
american
bonds
and
these
are
to
be
repaid
if
repaid
at
all
the
south
if
not
paid
at
all
then
england
will
have
sent
away
twelve
millions
worth
of
goods
for
nothing
and
this
would
be
the
scotch
way
of
obtaining
enormous
advantages
for
the
country
by
laying
out
its
in
foreign
loans
i
shall
conclude
this
subject
by
inserting
a
letter
which
i
find
in
the
of
the
instant
i
perfectly
agree
with
the
writer
the
editor
of
the
does
not
as
appears
by
the
remark
which
he
makes
at
the
head
of
it
but
i
shall
insert
the
whole
his
remark
and
all
and
add
a
remark
or
two
of
my
see
vol
p
this
is
a
pretty
round
sum
a
sum
the
very
naming
of
which
would
make
anybody
but
englishmen
stare
to
make
comparisons
with
own
would
have
little
effect
that
being
so
monstrous
that
every
other
sum
shrinks
into
nothingness
at
the
sight
of
it
but
let
us
look
at
the
united
states
for
they
have
and
a
debt
is
a
debt
and
this
debt
of
the
united
states
is
often
cited
as
an
apology
for
ours
even
the
parsons
having
at
last
come
to
cite
the
united
states
as
presenting
us
with
a
system
of
perfection
what
then
is
this
debt
of
the
united
states
why
it
was
on
the
of
january
this
that
is
to
say
dollars
that
is
to
say
at
four
shillings
and
sixpence
the
dollar
just
millions
that
is
to
say
pounds
than
our
capital
men
have
lent
to
the
south
americans
but
now
let
us
see
what
is
the
net
revenue
of
this
same
united
states
why
that
is
to
say
in
sterling
money
three
millions
three
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
and
some
odd
hundreds
that
is
to
say
almost
to
a
mere
fraction
a
of
the
whole
gross
amount
of
the
debt
observe
this
well
that
the
whole
of
the
debt
amounts
to
only
six
times
as
much
as
one
single
year
net
revenue
then
again
look
at
the
exports
of
the
united
states
these
exports
in
one
single
year
amount
to
dollars
and
in
pounds
sterling
now
what
can
the
south
american
state
show
in
this
way
have
they
any
exports
or
at
least
have
they
any
that
any
man
can
speak
of
with
certainty
have
they
any
revenue
wherewith
to
pay
the
interest
of
a
debt
when
they
are
borrowing
the
very
means
of
maintaining
themselves
now
against
the
bare
name
of
their
king
we
are
often
told
that
the
americans
borrowed
their
money
to
carry
on
their
revolutionary
war
with
aye
a
farthing
is
money
and
a
double
sovereign
is
no
more
than
money
but
surely
some
regard
is
to
be
had
to
the
some
regard
is
to
be
had
to
the
amount
of
the
money
and
is
there
any
man
in
his
senses
that
will
put
the
half
million
which
the
americans
borrowed
of
the
dutch
in
competition
that
will
name
on
the
same
day
this
half
million
with
the
millions
and
a
half
borrowed
by
the
south
americans
as
above
stated
in
short
it
is
almost
to
insult
the
understandings
of
my
readers
to
seem
to
institute
any
comparison
between
the
two
things
and
nothing
in
the
world
short
of
this
gambling
this
unprincipled
this
maddening
system
could
have
made
men
look
with
patience
for
one
single
moment
at
loans
like
these
tossed
into
the
air
with
the
hope
and
expectation
of
however
let
the
keep
their
bonds
let
them
feel
the
sweets
of
the
bill
and
of
the
consequent
puffing
up
of
the
english
funds
the
affair
is
theirs
they
have
rejected
my
advice
they
have
listened
to
the
broad
sheet
and
let
them
take
all
the
consequences
let
them
with
all
my
heart
die
with
starvation
and
as
they
expire
let
them

we
left

look

as

and
a
great
deal
more
brilliant

i
have
often
described
this
beautiful
village
which
lies
in
a
deep
dell
and
its
very
variously
shaped
environs
in
my
of
november

is
one
of

hard

high

deep

lofty

many

of

instructor
that
all
those
had
who
had
expected
to
see
the
price
of
agricultural
produce
brought
down
by
the
lessening
of
the
quantity
of
now
in
the
first
place
corn
is
on
an
average
a
seventh
lower
in
price
than
it
was
last
year
at
this
time
and
what
would
it
have
been
if
the
crop
and
the
stock
had
now
been
equal
to
what
they
were
last
year
all
in
good
time
therefore
good
thwaites
let
us
have
a
little
time
the
best
public
instructors
have
as
yet
only
fallen
in
number
sold
about
a
third
since
this
time
last
year
give
them
a
little
time
good
thwaites
and
you
will
see
them
come
down
to
your
heart
content
only
let
us
fairly
see
an
end
to
small
notes
and
there
will
soon
be
not
two
daily
best
public
instructors
left
in
all
the
entire
great
british
empire
but
as
man
is
not
to
live
on
bread
alone
so
corn
is
not
the
thing
that
the
owners
and
occupiers
of
the
land
have
to
look
to
there
are
timber
bark
underwood
wool
hides
pigs
sheep
and
cattle
all
those
together
make
in
amount
four
times
the
corn
at
the
very
least
i
know
that
these
have
greatly
fallen
in
price
since
last
year
but
i
am
in
a
sheep
and
wool
country
and
can
speak
positively
as
to
them
which
are
two
articles
of
very
great
importance
as
to
sheep
i
am
speaking
of
southdowns
which
are
the
great
stock
of
these
counties
as
to
sheep
they
have
fallen
in
price
since
last
august
lambs
as
well
as
ewes
and
as
to
the
wool
it
sold
in
at
a
tod
it
sold
last
year
at
a
tod
and
it
now
sells
at
a
tod
a
tod
is
avoirdupois
weight
so
that
the
price
of
southdown
wool
now
is
a
pound
and
a
fraction
over
and
this
is
i
believe
cheaper
than
it
has
ever
been
known
within
the
memory
of
the
oldest
man
living
the
best
public
instructor
may
perhaps
think
that
sheep
and
wool
are
a
trifling
affair
there
are
many
thousands
of
farmers
who
keep
each
a
flock
of
at
least
a
thousand
sheep
an
ewe
yields
about
of
wool
a
wether
a
ram
calculate
good
thwaites
what
a
difference
it
is
when
this
wool
becomes
a
pound
instead
of
and
instead
of
as
it
was
not
many
years
ago
in
short
every
middling
sheep
farmer
receives
this
year
about
less
as
the
produce
of
sheep
and
wool
than
he
received
last
year
and
on
an
average
is
more
than
half
his
rent
there
is
a
great
falling
off
in
the
price
of
horses
and
of
all
cattle
except
fat
cattle
and
observe
when
the
prospect
is
good
it
shows
a
rise
in
the
price
of
lean
cattle
not
in
that
of
the
meat
which
is
just
ready
to
go
into
the
mouth
prices
will
go
on
gradually
falling
as
they
did
from
to
inclusive
unless
upheld
by
untoward
seasons
or
by
an
issue
of
assignats
for
mind
it
would
be
no
joke
no
sham
it
would
be
an
issue
of
as
real
as
assignats
as
ever
came
from
the
mint
of
any
set
of
rascals
that
ever
robbed
and
enslaved
a
people
in
the
names
of

sunday
august
we
set
off
from
uphusband
on
friday
about
ten
the
morning
having
been
wet
my
sons
came
round
in
the
chaise
by
andover
and
weyhill
while
i
came
right
across
the
country
towards
ludgarshall
which
lies
in
the
road
from
andover
to
this
place
i
never
knew
the
so
troublesome
in
england
as
i
found
them
in
this
ride
i
was
obliged
to
carry
a
great
bough
and
to
keep
it
in
constant
motion
in
order
to
make
the
horse
peaceable
enough
to
enable
me
to
keep
on
his
back
it
is
a
country
of
fields
lanes
and
high
hedges
so
that
no
could
come
to
relieve
my
horse
and
in
spite
of
all
i
could
do
a
great
part
of
him
was
covered
with
foam
from
the
sweat
in
the
midst
of
this
i
got
at
one
time
a
little
out
of
my
road
in
or
near
a
place
called
tangley
i
rode
up
to
the
of
a
cottage
and
asked
the
woman
who
had
two
children
and
who
seemed
to
be
about
thirty
years
old
which
was
the
way
to
ludgarshall
which
i
knew
could
not
be
more
than
about
off
she
did
a
very
neat
smart
and
pretty
woman
but
she
did
not
know
the
way
to
this
rotten
borough
which
was
i
was
sure
only
about
four
miles
off
well
my
dear
good
woman
said
i
but
you
at
ludgarshall
no
nor
at
andover
six
miles
another
way
no
nor
at
marlborough
nine
miles
another
way
no
pray
were
you
born
in
this
house
yes
and
how
far
have
you
ever
been
from
this
house
oh
i
have
been
in
the
and
over
that
is
to
say
the
utmost
extent
of
her
voyages
had
been
about
two
and
a
half
miles
let
no
one
laugh
at
her
and
above
all
others
let
not
me
who
am
convinced
that
the
which
now
exist
of
human
bodies
from
place
to
are
amongst
the
of
the
country
the
destroyers
of
industry
of
morals
and
of
course
of
happiness
it
is
a
great
error
to
suppose
that
people
are
rendered
stupid
by
remaining
always
in
the
same
place
this
was
a
very
acute
woman
and
as
well
behaved
as
need
to
be
there
was
in
july
last
last
month
a
who
had
never
been
further
from
home
than
chorley
about
eight
or
ten
miles
and
who
started
off
and
went
to
rouen
in
france
and
back
again
to
london
in
the
space
of
about
ten
days
and
that
too
without
being
able
to
speak
or
to
understand
a
word
of
french
those
gentlemen
who
at
in
kent
were
so
kind
to
this
man
finding
that
he
had
voted
for
will
be
pleased
to
accept
of
my
best
thanks
wilding
that
is
the
man
name
was
full
of
expressions
of
gratitude
towards
these
gentlemen
he
spoke
of
others
who
were
good
to
him
on
his
way
and
even
at
calais
he
found
friends
on
my
account
but
he
was
particularly
loud
in
his
praises
of
the
gentlemen
in
kent
who
had
been
so
good
and
so
kind
to
him
that
he
seemed
quite
in
an
extasy
when
he
talked
of
their
conduct
before
i
got
to
the
i
came
out
upon
a
down
just
on
the
border
of
the
two
counties
hampshire
and
wiltshire
here
i
came
up
with
my
sons
and
we
entered
the
together
it
contained
some
rashers
of
bacon
and
a
very
civil
landlady
but
it
is
one
of
the
most
mean
and
beggarly
places
that
man
ever
set
his
eyes
on
the
curse
attending
corruption
seems
to
be
upon
it
the
look
of
the
place
would
make
one
swear
that
there
never
was
a
clean
shirt
in
it
since
the
first
stone
of
it
was
laid
it
must
have
been
a
large
place
once
though
it
now
contains
only
persons
men
women
and
children
the
borough
is
as
to
all
practical
purposes
as
much
private
property
as
this
pen
is
my
private
property
aye
aye
let
the
petitioners
of
manchester
bawl
as
long
as
they
like
against
all
other
evils
but
until
they
touch
this
they
do
nothing
at
all
everley
is
but
about
three
miles
from
ludgarshall
so
that
we
got
here
in
the
afternoon
of
friday
and
in
the
evening
a
very
heavy
storm
came
and
drove
away
all
flies
and
made
the
air
delightful
this
is
a
real
here
you
see
miles
and
miles
square
without
a
tree
or
hedge
or
bush
it
is
country
of
this
is
the
most
famous
place
in
all
england
for
i
was
here
at
this
very
inn
with
a
party
eighteen
years
ago
and
the
landlord
who
is
still
the
same
recognized
me
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
there
were
forty
brace
of
greyhounds
taken
out
into
the
field
on
one
of
the
days
and
every
brace
had
one
course
and
some
of
them
two
the
ground
is
the
finest
in
the
world
from
two
to
three
miles
for
the
hare
to
run
to
cover
and
not
a
stone
nor
a
bush
nor
a
hillock
it
was
here
proved
to
me
that
the
hare
is
by
far
the
swiftest
of
all
english
animals
for
i
saw
three
hares
in
one
day
from
the
dogs
to
give
dog
and
hare
a
fair
trial
there
should
be
but
dog
then
if
that
dog
got
so
close
as
to
compel
the
hare
that
would
be
a
proof
that
the
dog
ran
fastest
when
the
dog
or
dogs
never
get
near
enough
to
the
hare
to
induce
her
to
she
is
said
and
very
justly
to
from
them
and
as
i
saw
three
hares
do
this
in
one
day
i
conclude
that
the
hare
is
the
swiftest
animal
of
the
two
this
inn
is
one
of
the
nicest
and
in
summer
one
of
the
pleasantest
in
england
for
i
think
that
my
experience
in
this
way
will
justify
me
in
speaking
thus
positively
the
house
is
large
the
yard
and
the
stables
good
the
landlord
also
and
therefore
no
cribbing
your
horses
in
hay
or
straw
and
yourself
in
eggs
and
cream
the
garden
which
adjoins
the
south
side
of
the
house
is
large
of
good
shape
has
a
terrace
on
one
side
lies
on
the
slope
consists
of
clumps
of
shrubs
and
flowers
and
of
very
neatly
kept
in
the
lower
part
of
the
garden
there
are
high
trees
and
amongst
these
the
and
the
beyond
the
garden
is
a
large
clump
of
lofty
sycamores
and
in
these
a
most
populous
rookery
in
which
of
all
things
in
the
world
i
delight
the
village
which
contains
souls
lies
to
the
north
of
the
inn
but
adjoining
its
premises
all
the
rest
in
every
direction
is
bare
down
or
open
arable
i
am
now
sitting
at
one
of
the
southern
windows
of
this
inn
looking
across
the
garden
towards
the
rookery
it
is
nearly
the
rooks
are
skimming
and
curving
over
the
tops
of
the
trees
while
under
the
branches
i
see
a
flock
of
several
hundred
sheep
coming
nibbling
their
way
in
from
the
down
and
going
to
their
fold
now
what
devil
could
bring
old
nic
grimshaw
into
my
head
in
company
with
these
innocent
sheep
why
the
truth
is
this
nothing
is
as
it
runs
over
a
in
a
moment
and
while
i
was
writing
the
last
sentence
of
the
foregoing
paragraph
took
me
up
at
the
time
when
i
used
to
wear
a
and
to
carry
a
wooden
bottle
like
that
shepherd
boy
and
in
an
instant
it
hurried
me
along
through
my
no
very
short
life
of
adventure
of
toil
of
peril
of
pleasure
of
ardent
friendship
and
not
less
ardent
enmity
and
after
filling
me
with
wonder
that
a
heart
and
mind
so
wrapped
up
in
everything
belonging
to
the
gardens
the
fields
and
the
woods
should
have
been
condemned
to
waste
themselves
away
amidst
the
stench
the
noise
and
the
strife
of
cities
it
brought
me
the
present
and
sent
my
mind
back
to
what
i
have
yet
to
perform
about
nicholas
grimshaw
and
his
my
sons
set
off
about
three
on
their
way
to
herefordshire
where
i
intend
to
join
them
when
i
have
had
a
pretty
good
ride
in
this
country
there
is
no
pleasure
in
travelling
except
on
or
on
foot
carriages
take
your
body
from
place
to
place
and
if
you
merely
want
to
be
they
are
very
good
but
they
enable
you
to
see
and
to
know
nothing
at
all
of
the
country

monday
morning
a
very
fine
morning
a
man
years
of
just
beginning
to
mow
the
in
the
garden
i
thought
it
even
when
i
was
young
the
that
man
had
to
do
to
this
work
seems
nothing
but
it
tries
every
sinew
in
your
frame
if
you
go
upright
and
do
your
work
well
this
old
man
never
knew
how
to
do
it
well
and
he
stoops
and
he
hangs
his
scythe
wrong
but
with
all
this
it
must
be
a
surprising
man
to
mow
as
well
as
he
does
at
wish
may
be
able
to
mow
at
eighty
that
all
i
have
to
say
of
the
matter
i
am
just
setting
off
for
the
source
of
the
avon
which
runs
from
near
marlborough
to
salisbury
and
thence
to
the
sea
and
i
intend
to
pursue
it
as
far
as
salisbury
in
the
distance
of
thirty
miles
here
are
i
see
by
the
books
more
than
thirty
churches
i
wish
to
see
with
my
own
eyes
what
evidence
there
is
that
those
thirty
churches
were
built
without
hands
without
money
and
without
a
congregation
and
thus
to
find
matter
if
i
can
to
justify
the
mad
wretches
who
from
and
elsewhere
are
bothering
this
nation
to
death
about
a
surplus
popalashon
mon
my
horse
is
ready
and
the
rooks
are
just
gone
off
to
the
these
rooks
rob
the
pigs
but
they
have
to
do
it
i
wonder
upon
my
soul
i
do
that
there
is
no
lawyer
scotchman
or
to
propose
a
law
to
punish
the
rooks
for
ride
down
the
valley
of
the
avon
in
wiltshire
thou
shalt
not
muzzle
the
ox
when
he
treadeth
out
the
corn
and
the
labourer
is
worthy
of
his
reward
deuteronomy
ch

ver
cor
ix
tim
v
monday
i
came
off
this
morning
on
the
marlborough
road
about
two
miles
or
three
and
then
turned
off
over
the
downs
in
a
direction
in
search
of
the
source
of
the
avon
river
which
goes
down
to
salisbury
i
had
once
been
at
netheravon
a
village
in
this
valley
but
i
had
often
heard
this
valley
described
as
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
land
in
all
england
i
knew
that
there
were
about
thirty
parish
churches
standing
in
a
length
of
about
thirty
miles
and
in
an
average
width
of
hardly
a
mile
and
i
was
resolved
to
see
a
little
into
the
that
could
have
induced
our
fathers
to
build
all
these
churches
especially
if
as
the
scotch
would
have
us
believe
there
were
but
a
mere
handful
of
people
in
england
of
late
the
first
part
of
my
ride
this
morning
was
by
the
side
of
sir
john
astley
park
this
man
is
one
of
the
members
of
the
county
bennet
being
the
other
they
say
that
he
is
good
to
the
labouring
people
and
he
ought
to
be
good
for
being
a
member
of
parliament
of
the
lethbridge
and
dickenson
stamp
however
he
has
got
a
thumping
estate
though
it
be
borne
in
mind
the
and
the
and
the
have
each
their
separate
mortgage
upon
it
of
which
this
baronet
has
i
dare
say
too
much
justice
to
complain
seeing
that
the
amount
of
these
mortgages
was
absolutely
necessary
to
carry
on
pitt
and
perceval
and
castlereagh
wars
to
support
hanoverian
soldiers
in
england
to
fight
and
beat
the
americans
on
the
serpentine
river
to
give
wellington
a
kingly
estate
and
to
defray
the
expenses
of
manchester
and
other
yeomanry
cavalry
besides
all
the
various
charges
of
bills
and
of
these
being
the
cause
of
the
mortgages
the
worthy
baronet
has
i
will
engage
too
much
justice
to
complain
of
them
in
steering
across
the
down
i
came
to
a
large
farm
which
a
shepherd
told
me
was
milton
hill
farm
this
was
upon
the
high
land
and
before
i
came
to
the
edge
of
this
of
which
was
my
land
of
promise
or
at
least
of
great
expectation
for
i
could
not
imagine
that
thirty
churches
had
been
built
by
the
side
of
a
brook
for
it
is
no
more
during
the
greater
part
of
the
way
thirty
miles
long
the
shepherd
showed
me
the
way
towards
milton
and
at
the
end
of
about
a
mile
from
the
top
of
a
very
high
part
of
the
down
with
a
steep
slope
towards
the
valley
i
first
saw
this
of
and
a
most
beautiful
sight
it
was
villages
hamlets
large
farms
towers
steeples
fields
meadows
orchards
and
very
fine
timber
trees
scattered
all
over
the
valley
the
shape
of
the
thing
is
this
on
each
side
very
lofty
and
steep
in
some
places
and
sloping
miles
back
in
other
places
but
each
of
the
valley
are
downs
from
the
edge
of
the
downs
begin
capital
generally
of
very
great
dimensions
and
in
some
places
running
a
mile
or
two
back
into
little
formed
by
hills
of
downs
after
the
come
on
each
side
down
to
the
or
the
mansions
villages
and
hamlets
are
generally
situated
in
that
part
of
the
arable
land
which
comes
nearest
the
meadows
great
as
my
expectations
had
been
they
were
more
than
fulfilled
i
delight
in
this
sort
of
country
and
i
had
frequently
seen
the
vale
of
the
itchen
that
of
the
bourn
and
also
that
of
the
teste
in
hampshire
i
had
seen
the
vales
amongst
the
south
downs
but
i
never
before
saw
anything
to
please
me
like
this
valley
of
the
avon
i
sat
upon
my
horse
and
looked
over
milton
and
easton
and
pewsy
for
half
an
hour
though
i
had
not
breakfasted
the
hill
was
very
steep
a
road
going
slanting
down
it
was
still
so
steep
and
washed
so
very
deep
by
the
rains
of
ages
that
i
did
not
attempt
to
down
it
and
i
did
not
like
to
lead
my
horse
the
path
was
so
narrow
so
seeing
a
boy
with
a
drove
of
pigs
going
out
to
the
stubbles
i
beckoned
him
to
come
up
to
me
and
he
came
and
led
my
horse
down
for
me
endless
is
the
variety
in
the
shape
of
the
high
lands
which
form
this
valley
sometimes
the
slope
is
very
gentle
and
the
arable
lands
go
back
very
far
at
others
the
downs
come
out
into
the
valley
almost
like
piers
into
the
sea
being
very
steep
in
their
sides
as
well
as
their
ends
towards
the
valley
they
have
no
slope
at
their
other
ends
indeed
they
have
no
but
run
into
the
main
high
land
there
is
also
great
variety
in
the
width
of
the
valley
great
variety
in
the
width
of
the
meadows
but
the
land
appears
all
to
be
of
the
very
best
and
it
must
be
so
for
the
farmers
confess
it
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
way
and
that
not
perhaps
the
least
striking
of
exposing
the
folly
the
stupidity
the
inanity
the
presumption
the
insufferable
emptiness
and
insolence
and
barbarity
of
those
numerous
wretches
who
have
now
the
audacity
to
propose
to
the
people
of
england
upon
the
principle
of
the
monster
malthus
who
has
furnished
the
unfeeling
oligarchs
and
their
with
the
pretence
that
has
a
natural
propensity
to
breed
faster
than
food
can
be
raised
for
the
it
seemed
to
me
that
one
way
of
exposing
this
mixture
of
madness
and
of
blasphemy
was
to
take
a
look
now
that
the
harvest
is
in
at
the
produce
the
mouths
the
condition
and
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
a
spot
like
this
which
god
has
favoured
with
every
good
that
he
has
had
to
bestow
upon
man
from
the
top
of
the
hill
i
was
not
a
little
surprised
to
see
in
every
part
of
the
valley
that
my
eye
could
reach
a
due
a
large
portion
of
fields
of
swedish
turnips
all
looking
extremely
well
i
had
found
the
turnips
of
both
sorts
by
no
means
bad
from
salt
hill
to
newbury
but
from
newbury
through
burghclere
highclere
uphusband
and
tangley
i
had
seen
but
few
at
and
about
ludgarshall
and
everley
i
had
seen
hardly
any
but
when
i
came
this
morning
to
milton
hill
farm
i
saw
a
very
large
field
of
what
appeared
to
me
to
be
fine
swedish
turnips
in
the
valley
however
i
found
them
much
finer
and
the
fields
were
very
beautiful
objects
forming
as
their
colour
did
so
great
a
contrast
with
that
of
the
fallows
and
the
stubbles
which
latter
are
this
year
singularly
clean
and
bright
having
gotten
to
the
bottom
of
the
hill
i
proceeded
on
to
the
village
of
milton
i
left
easton
away
at
my
right
and
i
did
not
go
up
to
watton
rivers
where
the
river
avon
rises
and
which
lies
just
close
to
the
corner
of
marlborough
forest
and
at
about
or
miles
from
the
town
of
marlborough
lower
down
the
river
as
i
thought
there
lived
a
friend
who
was
a
great
farmer
and
whom
i
intended
to
call
on
it
being
my
way
however
always
to
begin
making
enquiries
soon
enough
i
asked
the
where
this
friend
lived
and
to
my
surprise
i
found
that
he
lived
in
the
parish
of
milton
after
riding
up
to
the
church
as
being
the
centre
of
the
village
i
went
on
towards
the
house
of
my
friend
which
lay
on
my
road
down
the
valley
i
have
many
many
times
witnessed
agreeable
surprise
but
i
do
not
know
that
i
ever
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
saw
people
so
much
surprised
and
pleased
as
this
farmer
and
his
family
were
at
seeing
me
people
often
you
that
they
are
to
you
and
in
general
they
speak
truth
i
take
pretty
good
care
not
to
approach
any
house
with
the
smallest
appearance
of
a
design
to
eat
or
drink
in
it
unless
i
be
of
a
cordial
reception
but
my
friend
at
fifield
it
is
in
milton
parish
and
all
his
family
really
seemed
to
be
delighted
beyond
all
expression
when
i
set
out
this
morning
i
intended
to
go
all
the
way
down
to
the
city
of
salisbury
but
i
soon
found
that
to
refuse
to
sleep
at
fifield
would
cost
me
a
great
deal
more
trouble
than
a
day
was
worth
so
that
i
made
my
mind
up
to
stay
in
this
which
has
one
of
the
nicest
gardens
and
it
contains
some
of
the
finest
flowers
that
i
ever
saw
and
all
is
disposed
with
as
much
good
taste
as
i
have
ever
witnessed
here
i
am
then
just
going
to
bed
after
having
spent
as
pleasant
a
day
as
i
ever
spent
in
my
life
i
have
heard
that
birkbeck
lost
his
life
by
attempting
to
cross
a
river
on
but
if
what
i
have
heard
besides
be
true
that
life
must
have
been
hardly
worth
preserving
for
they
say
that
he
was
reduced
to
a
very
deplorable
state
and
i
have
heard
from
what
i
deem
unquestionable
authority
that
his
two
beautiful
and
accomplished
daughters
are
married
to
two
common
labourers
one
a
yankee
and
the
other
an
irishman
neither
of
whom
has
probably
a
second
shirt
to
his
back
or
a
single
pair
of
shoes
to
put
his
feet
into
these
poor
girls
owe
their
ruin
and
misery
if
my
information
be
correct
and
at
any
rate
hundreds
besides
birkbeck
himself
owe
their
utter
ruin
the
most
scandalous
degradation
together
with
great
bodily
suffering
to
the
vanity
the
conceit
the
presumption
of
birkbeck
who
observe
richly
merited
all
that
he
suffered
not
excepting
his
death
for
he
sinned
with
his
eyes
open
he
rejected
all
advice
he
persevered
after
he
saw
his
error
he
dragged
thousands
into
ruin
along
with
him
and
he
most
vilely
calumniated
the
man
who
after
having
most
disinterestedly
but
in
vain
endeavoured
to
preserve
him
from
ruin
endeavoured
to
preserve
those
who
were
in
danger
of
being
deluded
by
him
when
in
before
he
set
out
for
america
i
was
in
catherine
street
strand
london
so
earnestly
pressing
him
not
to
go
to
the
back
countries
he
had
one
of
these
daughters
with
him
after
talking
to
him
for
some
time
and
describing
the
risks
and
disadvantages
of
the
back
countries
i
turned
towards
the
daughter
and
in
a
sort
of
joking
way
said
miss
birkbeck
take
my
advice
do
let
anybody
get
more
than
twenty
miles
from
boston
new
york
philadelphia
or
baltimore
upon
which
he
gave
me
a
most
look
and
observed
miss
birkbeck
has
sir
whom
she
knows
it
to
be
her
duty
to
obey
this
snap
was
enough
for
me
i
saw
that
this
was
a
man
so
full
of
that
it
was
impossible
to
do
anything
with
him
he
seemed
to
me
to
be
bent
upon
his
own
destruction
i
thought
it
my
duty
to
warn
of
their
danger
some
took
the
warning
others
did
not
but
he
and
his
brother
adventurer
flower
never
forgave
me
and
they
resorted
to
all
the
means
in
their
power
to
do
me
injury
they
did
me
no
injury
no
thanks
to
them
and
i
have
seen
them
most
severely
but
most
justly
punished
tuesday
i
set
off
from
fifield
this
morning
and
got
here
about
one
with
my
clothes
wet
while
they
are
drying
and
while
a
mutton
chop
is
getting
ready
i
sit
down
to
make
some
notes
of
what
i
have
seen
since
i
left
enford
but
here
comes
my
dinner
and
i
must
put
off
my
notes
till
i
have
dined
wednesday
my
ride
yesterday
from
milton
to
this
city
of
salisbury
was
without
any
exception
the
most
pleasant
it
brought
before
me
the
greatest
number
of
to
me
interesting
objects
and
it
gave
rise
to
more
interesting
reflections
than
i
remember
ever
to
have
had
brought
before
my
eyes
or
into
my
mind
in
any
one
day
of
my
life
and
therefore
this
ride
was
without
any
exception
the
most
pleasant
that
i
ever
had
in
my
life
as
far
as
my
recollection
serves
me
i
got
a
little
wet
in
the
middle
of
the
day
but
i
got
dry
again
and
i
arrived
here
in
very
good
time
though
i
went
over
the
accursed
hill
old
sarum
and
went
across
to
laverstoke
before
i
came
to
salisbury
let
us
now
then
look
back
over
this
part
of
wiltshire
and
see
whether
the
inhabitants
ought
to
be
transported
by
order
of
the
emigration
committee
of
which
we
shall
see
and
say
more
i
have
before
described
this
valley
generally
let
me
now
speak
of
it
a
little
more
in
detail
the
farms
are
all
large
and
generally
speaking
they
were
always
large
i
dare
say
because
is
one
of
the
great
things
here
and
sheep
in
a
country
like
this
must
be
kept
in
to
be
of
any
profit
the
sheep
principally
manure
the
land
this
is
to
be
done
only
by
and
to
fold
you
must
have
a
every
farm
has
its
portion
of
down
arable
and
meadow
and
in
many
places
the
latter
are
watered
meadows
which
is
a
great
resource
where
sheep
are
kept
in
flocks
because
these
meadows
furnish
grass
for
the
suckling
ewes
early
in
the
spring
and
indeed
because
they
have
always
food
in
them
for
sheep
and
cattle
of
all
sorts
these
meadows
have
had
no
part
of
the
suffering
from
the
drought
this
year
they
fed
the
ewes
and
lambs
in
the
spring
and
they
are
now
yielding
a
heavy
crop
of
hay
for
i
saw
men
mowing
in
them
in
several
places
particularly
about
netheravon
though
it
was
raining
at
the
time
the
turnips
look
pretty
well
all
the
way
down
the
valley
but
i
see
very
few
except
swedish
turnips
the
early
common
turnips
very
nearly
all
failed
i
believe
but
the
stubbles
are
beautifully
bright
and
the
tell
us
that
the
crops
are
good
especially
of
wheat
this
is
not
a
country
of
pease
and
beans
nor
of
oats
except
for
home
consumption
the
crops
are
wheat
barley
wool
and
lambs
and
these
latter
not
to
be
sold
to
butchers
but
to
be
sold
at
the
great
fairs
to
those
who
are
going
to
keep
them
for
some
time
whether
to
breed
from
or
finally
to
fat
for
the
butcher
it
is
the
pulse
and
the
oats
that
appear
to
have
failed
most
this
year
and
therefore
this
valley
has
not
suffered
i
do
not
perceive
that
they
have
many
but
what
they
have
of
this
base
root
seem
to
look
well
enough
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
villains
upon
earth
sir
walter
raleigh
who
they
say
first
brought
this
root
into
england
he
was
hanged
at
last
what
a
pity
since
he
was
to
be
hanged
the
hanging
did
not
take
place
before
he
became
such
a
mischievous
devil
as
he
was
in
the
latter
of
his
life
the
down
this
valley
are
beautiful
to
behold
they
contain
from
five
to
fifteen
banging
besides
and
and
also
besides
the
contents
of
the
barns
many
of
which
exceed
a
hundred
some
two
hundred
and
i
saw
one
at
pewsey
and
another
at
fittleton
each
of
which
exceeded
two
hundred
and
fifty
feet
in
length
at
a
farm
which
in
the
old
maps
is
called
chissenbury
priory
i
think
i
counted
ricks
of
one
sort
and
another
and
sixteen
or
eighteen
of
them
i
could
not
conveniently
get
to
the
yard
without
longer
delay
than
i
wished
to
make
but
i
could
not
be
much
out
in
my
counting
a
very
fine
sight
this
was
and
it
could
not
meet
the
eye
without
making
one
look
round
and
in
vain
see
the
people
who
were
to
eat
all
this
and
without
making
one
reflect
on
the
horrible
the
unnatural
the
base
and
infamous
state
in
which
we
must
be
when
projects
are
on
foot
and
are
openly
avowed
for
those
who
raise
this
food
because
they
want
to
eat
enough
of
it
to
keep
them
alive
and
when
no
project
is
on
foot
for
transporting
the
idlers
who
live
in
luxury
upon
this
same
food
when
no
project
is
on
foot
for
transporting
pensioners
parsons
or
people
a
little
while
before
i
came
to
this
i
saw
in
one
piece
about
four
hundred
acres
of
and
i
saw
a
which
i
thought
contained
an
acre
of
ground
and
had
in
it
about
four
thousand
sheep
and
lambs
the
fold
was
divided
into
three
separate
flocks
but
the
piece
of
ground
was
one
and
the
same
and
i
thought
it
contained
about
an
acre
at
one
farm
between
pewsey
and
upavon
i
counted
more
than
hogs
in
one
stubble
this
is
certainly
the
most
delightful
farming
in
the
world
no
ditches
no
no
drains
hardly
any
hedges
no
dirt
and
mire
even
in
the
wettest
seasons
of
the
year
and
though
the
downs
are
naked
and
cold
the
valleys
are
snugness
itself
they
are
as
to
the
downs
what
are
in
parks
or
lawns
when
you
are
going
over
the
downs
you
look
the
valleys
as
in
the
case
of
the
and
if
you
be
not
acquainted
with
the
country
your
surprise
when
you
come
to
the
edge
of
the
hill
is
very
great
the
shelter
in
these
valleys
and
particularly
where
the
downs
are
steep
and
lofty
on
the
sides
is
very
complete
then
the
trees
are
everywhere
lofty
they
are
generally
elms
with
some
ashes
which
delight
in
the
soil
that
they
find
here
there
are
almost
always
two
or
three
large
clumps
of
trees
in
every
parish
and
a
rookery
or
two
not
to
every
parish
by
the
water
edge
there
are
willows
and
to
almost
every
farm
there
is
a
fine
orchard
the
trees
being
in
general
very
fine
and
this
year
they
are
in
general
well
loaded
with
fruit
so
that
all
taken
together
it
seems
impossible
to
find
a
more
beautiful
and
pleasant
country
than
this
or
to
imagine
any
life
more
easy
and
happy
than
men
might
here
lead
if
they
were
untormented
by
an
accursed
system
that
takes
the
food
from
those
that
raise
it
and
gives
it
to
those
that
do
nothing
that
is
useful
to
man
here
the
farmer
has
always
an
abundance
of
straw
his
is
never
without
it
cattle
and
horses
are
bedded
up
to
their
eyes
the
yards
are
put
close
under
the
shelter
of
a
hill
or
are
protected
by
lofty
and
trees
every
animal
seems
comfortably
situated
and
in
the
dreariest
days
of
winter
these
are
perhaps
the
happiest
scenes
in
the
world
or
rather
they
would
be
such
if
those
whose
labour
makes
it
all
trees
corn
sheep
and
everything
had
but
fair
of
the
produce
of
that
labour
what
share
they
really
have
of
it
one
can
not
exactly
say
but
i
should
suppose
that
every
labouring
in
this
valley
raises
as
much
food
as
would
suffice
for
fifty
or
a
hundred
persons
fed
like
himself
at
a
farm
at
milton
there
were
according
to
my
calculation
quarters
of
wheat
and
quarters
of
barley
of
the
present
crop
the
farm
keeps
on
an
average
sheep
it
breeds
and
rears
an
usual
proportion
of
pigs
fats
the
usual
proportion
of
hogs
and
i
suppose
rears
and
fats
the
usual
proportion
of
poultry
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
this
farm
was
in
point
of
produce
about
of
the
parish
therefore
the
land
of
this
parish
produces
annually
about
quarters
of
wheat
quarters
of
barley
the
wool
of
sheep
together
with
the
pigs
and
poultry
now
then
leaving
green
or
moist
vegetables
out
of
the
question
as
being
things
that
human
creatures
and
especially
human
creatures
ought
never
to
use
and
saying
nothing
at
present
about
milk
and
butter
leaving
these
wholly
out
of
the
question
let
us
see
how
many
people
the
produce
of
this
parish
would
keep
supposing
the
people
to
live
all
alike
and
to
have
plenty
of
food
and
clothing
in
order
to
come
at
the
fact
here
let
us
see
what
would
be
the
consumption
of
one
family
let
it
be
a
family
of
five
persons
a
man
wife
and
three
children
one
child
big
enough
to
work
one
big
enough
to
eat
heartily
and
one
a
baby
and
this
is
a
pretty
fair
average
of
the
state
of
people
in
the
country
such
a
family
would
want
lb
of
bread
they
would
want
a
pound
of
mutton
they
would
want
two
pounds
of
bacon
they
would
want
on
an
average
winter
and
summer
a
gallon
and
a
half
of
beer
for
i
mean
that
they
should
live
without
the
aid
of
the
eastern
or
the
western
if
were
absolutely
necessary
for
the
baby
there
would
be
quite
enough
in
the
parish
now
then
to
begin
with
the
bread
a
pound
of
good
wheat
makes
a
pound
of
good
bread
for
though
the
offal
be
taken
out
the
water
is
put
in
and
indeed
the
fact
is
that
a
pound
of
wheat
will
make
a
pound
of
bread
leaving
the
offal
of
the
wheat
to
feed
pigs
or
other
animals
and
to
produce
other
human
food
in
this
way
the
family
would
then
use
lb
of
wheat
in
the
year
which
at
lb
a
bushel
would
be
leaving
out
a
fraction
bushels
or
three
quarters
and
six
bushels
the
next
comes
the
mutton
lb
for
the
year
next
the
bacon
lb
as
to
the
quantity
of
mutton
produced
the
sheep
are
bred
here
and
not
fatted
in
general
but
we
may
fairly
suppose
that
each
of
the
sheep
here
each
of
the
makes
first
or
last
half
a
fat
sheep
so
that
a
farm
that
keeps
on
an
average
sheep
produces
annually
fat
sheep
suppose
the
mutton
to
be
lb
a
quarter
then
the
family
will
want
within
a
trifle
of
seven
sheep
a
year
of
bacon
or
pork
score
will
be
wanted
hogs
differ
so
much
in
their
propensity
to
fat
that
it
is
difficult
to
calculate
about
them
but
this
is
a
very
good
rule
when
you
see
a
fat
hog
and
know
how
many
he
will
weigh
set
down
to
his
account
a
sack
half
a
quarter
of
barley
for
every
score
of
his
weight
for
let
him
have
been
as
the
french
call
it
as
he
may
this
will
be
about
the
real
cost
of
him
when
he
is
fat
a
sack
of
barley
will
make
a
score
of
bacon
and
it
will
not
make
more
therefore
the
family
would
want
quarters
of
barley
in
the
year
for
bacon
as
to
the
gallons
to
the
bushel
of
malt
is
very
good
but
as
we
allow
of
no
spirits
no
wine
and
none
of
the
slave
produce
we
will
suppose
that
a
part
of
the
beer
is
stuff
this
would
require
two
bushels
of
malt
to
the
gallons
the
whole
would
therefore
take
bushels
of
malt
and
a
bushel
of
barley
makes
a
bushel
of
malt
and
by
the
pays
the
expense
of
malting
here
then
the
family
would
want
for
beer
four
quarters
and
three
bushels
of
barley
the
annual
consumption
of
the
family
in
victuals
and
drink
would
then
be
as
follows
qrs
bush
wheat
barley
sheep
this
being
the
case
the
quarters
of
wheat
which
the
parish
annually
produces
would
suffice
for
families
the
quarters
of
barley
would
suffice
for
families
the
fat
sheep
being
half
the
number
kept
would
suffice
for
families
so
that
here
is
produced
in
the
parish
of
milton
for
for
and
and
for
families
besides
victuals
and
drink
there
are
clothes
fuel
tools
and
household
goods
wanting
but
there
are
milk
butter
eggs
poultry
rabbits
hares
and
partridges
which
i
have
not
noticed
and
these
are
all
eatables
and
are
all
eaten
too
and
as
to
clothing
and
indeed
fuel
and
all
other
wants
beyond
eating
and
drinking
are
there
not
fleeces
of
southdown
wool
weighing
all
together
and
capable
of
being
made
into
yards
of
broad
cloth
at
two
pounds
and
a
half
of
wool
to
the
yard
setting
therefore
the
wool
the
milk
butter
eggs
poultry
and
game
against
all
the
wants
beyond
the
solid
food
and
drink
we
see
that
the
parish
of
milton
that
we
have
under
our
eye
would
give
bread
to
families
mutton
to
and
bacon
and
beer
to
the
reason
why
wheat
and
mutton
are
produced
in
a
proportion
so
much
greater
than
the
materials
for
making
bacon
and
beer
is
that
the
wheat
and
the
mutton
are
more
loudly
demanded
a
and
are
much
more
cheaply
conveyed
away
in
proportion
to
their
value
for
instance
the
wheat
and
mutton
are
wanted
in
the
infernal
wen
and
some
barley
is
wanted
there
in
the
shape
of
malt
but
hogs
are
not
fatted
in
the
wen
and
a
larger
proportion
of
the
barley
is
used
where
it
is
grown
here
is
then
bread
for
families
mutton
for
and
bacon
and
beer
for
let
us
take
the
average
of
the
three
and
then
we
have
families
for
the
keeping
of
whom
and
in
this
good
manner
too
the
parish
of
milton
yields
a
sufficiency
in
the
wool
the
milk
butter
eggs
poultry
and
game
we
have
seen
ample
and
much
more
than
ample
provision
for
all
wants
other
than
those
of
mere
food
and
drink
what
i
have
allowed
in
food
and
drink
is
by
no
means
excessive
it
is
but
a
pound
of
bread
and
a
little
more
than
of
meat
a
day
to
each
person
on
an
average
and
the
beer
is
not
a
drop
too
much
there
are
no
green
and
moist
vegetables
included
in
my
account
but
there
would
be
some
and
they
would
not
do
any
harm
but
no
man
can
say
or
at
least
none
but
a
base
usurer
who
would
grind
money
out
of
the
bones
of
his
own
father
no
other
man
can
or
will
say
that
i
have
been
to
this
family
and
yet
good
god
what
extravagance
is
here
if
the
labourers
of
england
be
now
treated
justly
is
there
a
family
even
amongst
those
who
live
the
hardest
in
the
wen
that
would
not
shudder
at
the
thought
of
living
upon
what
i
have
allowed
to
this
family
yet
what
do
labourers
families
get
compared
to
this
the
answer
to
that
question
ought
to
make
us
shudder
indeed
the
amount
of
my
allowance
compared
with
the
amount
of
the
allowance
that
labourers
now
have
is
necessary
to
be
stated
here
before
i
proceed
further
the
wheat
qrs
and
bushels
at
present
price
the
quarter
amounts
to
the
barley
for
bacon
and
beer
qrs
bushels
at
present
price
the
quarter
amounts
to
the
seven
sheep
at
each
amount
to
the
total
is
and
this
observe
for
victuals
and
just
food
and
drink
enough
to
keep
people
in
working
condition
what
then
the
labourers
get
to
what
fare
has
this
wretched
and
most
infamous
system
brought
them
why
such
a
family
as
i
have
described
is
allowed
to
have
the
only
about
a
week
the
parish
allowance
is
only
about
for
the
five
people
including
clothing
fuel
bedding
and
everything
monstrous
state
of
things
but
let
us
suppose
it
to
be
even
that
makes
only
a
year
for
food
drink
clothing
fuel
and
everything
whereas
i
allow
a
year
for
the
bare
eating
and
drinking
and
that
is
little
enough
monstrous
barbarous
horrible
as
this
appears
we
do
not
however
see
it
in
half
its
horrors
our
indignation
and
rage
against
this
infernal
system
is
not
half
roused
till
we
see
the
small
number
of
labourers
who
raise
all
the
food
and
the
drink
and
of
course
the
mere
trifling
portion
of
it
that
they
are
suffered
to
retain
for
their
own
use
the
parish
of
milton
does
as
we
have
seen
produce
food
drink
clothing
and
all
other
things
enough
for
families
or
persons
upon
my
allowance
which
is
a
great
deal
more
than
three
times
the
present
allowance
because
the
present
allowance
includes
clothing
fuel
tools
and
everything
now
then
according
to
the
population
return
laid
before
parliament
this
parish
contains
persons
or
according
to
my
division
one
hundred
families
so
that
here
are
about
families
to
raise
food
and
drink
enough
and
to
raise
wool
and
other
things
to
pay
for
all
other
necessaries
for
and
families
aye
and
five
hundred
and
two
families
fed
and
lodged
too
on
my
liberal
scale
fed
and
lodged
according
to
the
present
scale
this
one
hundred
families
raise
enough
to
supply
more
and
many
more
than
fifteen
hundred
families
or
seven
thousand
five
hundred
persons
and
yet
those
who
do
the
work
are
half
starved
in
the
families
there
are
we
will
suppose
able
working
men
and
as
many
boys
sometimes
assisted
by
the
women
and
stout
girls
what
a
handful
of
people
to
raise
such
a
quantity
of
food
what
injustice
what
a
hellish
system
it
must
be
to
make
those
who
raise
it
skin
and
bone
and
nakedness
while
the
food
and
drink
and
wool
are
almost
all
carried
away
to
be
heaped
on
the
pensioners
soldiers
and
other
swarms
of
if
such
an
operation
do
not
need
putting
an
end
to
then
the
devil
himself
is
a
saint
thus
it
must
be
or
much
about
thus
all
the
way
down
this
fine
and
beautiful
and
interesting
valley
there
are
agricultural
parishes
the
two
last
being
in
town
being
fisherton
and
salisbury
now
according
to
the
population
return
the
whole
of
these
parishes
contain
persons
or
according
to
my
division
families
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
proportion
that
we
have
seen
in
the
case
of
milton
does
not
hold
good
all
the
way
through
that
is
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
produce
does
not
exceed
the
consumption
in
every
other
case
in
the
same
degree
that
it
does
in
the
case
of
milton
and
indeed
if
i
were
to
judge
from
the
number
of
houses
and
the
number
of
ricks
of
corn
i
should
suppose
that
the
excess
was
still
greater
in
several
of
the
other
parishes
but
supposing
it
to
be
no
greater
supposing
the
same
proportion
to
continue
all
the
way
from
watton
rivers
to
stratford
dean
then
here
are
persons
raising
food
and
raiment
sufficient
for
persons
fed
and
lodged
according
to
my
scale
and
sufficient
for
persons
according
to
the
scale
on
which
the
unhappy
labourers
of
this
fine
valley
are
now
fed
and
lodged
and
yet
there
is
an
sitting
to
devise
the
means
of
getting
not
of
the
idlers
not
of
the
pensioners
not
of
the
not
of
the
parsons
to
relieve
whom
we
have
seen
the
poor
labourers
taxed
to
the
tune
of
a
million
and
a
half
of
money
not
of
the
soldiers
but
to
devise
means
of
getting
rid
of
working
who
are
grudged
even
the
miserable
morsel
that
they
get
there
is
in
the
men
calling
themselves
english
country
gentlemen
something
superlatively
base
they
are
i
sincerely
believe
the
most
cruel
the
most
unfeeling
the
most
brutally
insolent
but
i
know
i
can
prove
i
can
safely
take
my
oath
that
they
are
the
most
base
of
all
the
creatures
that
god
ever
suffered
to
disgrace
the
human
shape
the
base
wretches
know
well
that
the
amount
to
more
than
a
year
and
that
the
amount
to
about
yet
while
the
cowardly
reptiles
never
utter
a
word
against
the
taxes
they
are
incessantly
railing
against
the
though
it
is
and
they
know
it
the
taxes
that
make
the
paupers
the
base
wretches
know
well
that
the
sum
of
money
given
even
to
the
fellows
that
gather
the
taxes
is
greater
in
amount
than
the
the
base
wretches
know
well
that
the
money
given
to
the
who
ought
not
to
have
a
single
farthing
amounts
to
more
than
the
poor
receive
out
of
the
rates
the
base
wretches
know
well
that
the
common
now
receives
more
pay
per
week
exclusive
of
clothing
firing
candle
and
lodging
the
base
wretches
know
that
the
common
receives
more
to
go
down
his
own
single
throat
than
the
overseers
and
magistrates
allow
to
a
working
man
his
wife
and
three
children
the
base
wretches
know
all
this
well
and
yet
their
railings
are
confined
to
the
and
the
and
it
is
expected
that
they
will
next
session
urge
the
parliament
to
pass
a
law
to
enable
overseers
and
vestries
and
magistrates
transport
paupers
beyond
the
they
are
base
enough
for
this
or
for
any
thing
but
the
whole
system
will
go
to
the
devil
long
before
they
will
get
such
an
act
passed
long
before
they
will
see
perfected
this
consummation
of
their
infamous
tyranny
it
is
manifest
enough
that
the
of
this
valley
was
at
one
time
many
times
over
what
it
is
now
for
in
the
first
place
what
were
the
churches
built
the
population
of
the
parishes
is
now
but
little
more
than
of
that
of
the
single
parish
of
kensington
and
there
are
several
of
the
churches
bigger
than
the
church
at
kensington
what
then
should
all
these
churches
have
been
built
and
besides
where
did
the
hands
come
from
and
where
did
the
money
come
from
these
churches
would
now
not
only
hold
all
the
inhabitants
men
women
and
children
but
all
the
household
goods
and
tools
and
implements
of
the
whole
of
them
farmers
and
all
if
you
leave
out
the
wagons
and
carts
in
three
instances
fifield
milston
and
the
will
hold
all
the
inhabitants
even
down
to
the
and
the
babies
what
then
will
any
man
believe
that
these
churches
were
built
for
such
little
knots
of
people
we
are
told
about
the
superstition
of
our
fathers
and
of
their
readiness
to
gratify
the
priests
by
building
altars
and
other
religious
edifices
but
we
must
think
those
priests
to
have
been
most
devout
creatures
indeed
if
we
believe
that
they
chose
to
have
the
money
laid
out
in
churches
rather
than
have
it
put
into
their
own
pockets
at
any
rate
we
all
know
that
protestant
priests
have
no
whims
of
and
that
they
never
lay
out
upon
churches
any
money
that
they
can
by
any
means
get
hold
of
but
suppose
that
we
were
to
believe
that
the
priests
had
in
old
times
this
unaccountable
taste
and
suppose
we
were
to
believe
that
a
knot
of
people
who
might
be
crammed
into
a
were
seized
and
very
frequently
too
with
the
desire
of
having
a
big
church
to
go
to
we
must
after
all
this
believe
that
this
knot
of
people
were
more
than
or
that
they
had
surprising
else
we
can
not
believe
that
they
had
of
gratifying
the
strange
wishes
of
their
priests
and
their
own
not
less
strange
and
even
if
we
could
believe
that
they
thought
that
they
were
paving
their
way
to
heaven
by
building
churches
which
were
a
hundred
times
too
large
for
the
population
still
we
can
not
believe
that
the
building
could
have
been
effected
without
bodily
force
and
where
was
this
force
to
come
from
if
the
people
were
not
more
numerous
than
they
now
are
what
again
i
ask
were
these
churches
stuck
up
not
a
mile
from
each
other
what
were
churches
made
if
the
population
had
been
no
greater
than
it
is
now
but
in
fact
you
plainly
see
all
the
traces
of
a
great
ancient
population
the
churches
are
almost
all
large
and
built
in
the
best
manner
many
of
them
are
very
fine
edifices
very
costly
in
the
building
and
in
the
cases
where
the
body
of
the
church
has
been
altered
in
the
repairing
of
it
so
as
to
make
it
smaller
the
which
everywhere
defies
the
hostility
of
time
shows
you
what
the
church
must
formerly
have
been
this
is
the
case
in
several
instances
and
there
are
two
or
three
of
these
villages
which
must
formerly
have
been
and
particularly
pewsy
and
upavon
there
are
now
no
less
than
nine
of
the
parishes
out
of
the
that
have
either
no
or
have
such
as
are
in
such
a
state
that
a
parson
will
not
or
can
not
live
in
them
three
of
them
are
without
any
at
all
and
the
rest
are
become
poor
mean
places
this
latter
is
the
case
at
upavon
which
was
formerly
a
very
considerable
place
nothing
can
more
clearly
show
than
this
that
all
as
far
as
buildings
and
population
are
concerned
has
been
long
upon
the
decline
and
decay
dilapidation
after
dilapidation
have
at
last
almost
effaced
even
the
and
that
too
in
of
the
ecclesiastical
as
well
as
civil
the
land
remains
and
the
crops
and
the
sheep
come
as
abundantly
as
ever
but
they
are
now
sent
almost
wholly
away
instead
of
remaining
as
formerly
to
be
in
great
part
consumed
in
these
parishes
the
in
my
map
mark
the
spots
where
or
gentlemen
mansions
formerly
stood
and
stood
too
only
about
sixty
years
ago
every
parish
had
its
manor
house
in
the
first
place
and
then
there
were
down
this
valley
others
so
that
in
this
distance
of
about
thirty
miles
there
stood
fifty
mansion
houses
where
are
they
i
believe
there
are
but
eight
that
are
at
all
worthy
of
the
name
of
mansion
houses
and
even
these
are
but
poorly
kept
up
and
except
in
two
or
three
instances
are
of
no
benefit
to
the
labouring
people
they
employ
but
few
persons
and
in
short
do
not
half
supply
the
place
of
any
eight
of
the
old
mansions
all
these
mansions
all
these
parsonages
aye
and
their
goods
and
furniture
together
with
the
clocks
the
brass
kettles
the
the
good
bedding
and
good
clothes
and
good
furniture
and
the
stock
in
pigs
or
in
money
of
the
inferior
classes
in
this
series
of
once
populous
and
gay
villages
and
hamlets
all
these
have
been
by
the
accursed
system
of
taxing
and
funding
and
by
the
exactions
of
the
state
and
by
the
not
less
real
though
less
generally
understood
extortions
of
the
arising
out
of
all
these
have
been
by
these
accursed
means
conveyed
away
out
of
this
valley
to
the
haunts
of
the
and
the
monopolizers
there
are
many
of
the
the
ruins
of
which
you
yet
behold
at
milton
there
are
two
mansion
houses
the
walls
and
the
roofs
of
which
yet
remain
but
which
are
falling
gradually
to
pieces
and
the

are
crumbling
down

had
taken
away
all
the
goods
all
the
substance
of
the
little
gentry
and
of
the
labouring
class
snip
was
not
i
dare
say
aware
that
this

in
this
one
vale
of
only
thirty
miles
long
dilapidated
and
in
some
cases
wholly
demolished
nine
out
of
even
of
the
parsonage
houses
i
told
snip
at
the
time
that
could
create
no
valuable
thing
i
begged
snip
to
bear
this
in
mind
i
besought
all
my
readers
and
particularly
mathias
atwood
one
of
the
members
for
not
to
believe
that
ever
did
or
ever
could
anything
of
any
value
i
besought
him
to
look
well
into
the
matter
and
assured
him
that
he
would
find
that
though
could
nothing
of
value
it
was
able
to
everything
of
value
able
to
strip
a
little
gentry
able
to
dilapidate
even
parsonage
houses
able
to
rob
gentlemen
of
their
estates
and
labourers
of
their
and
their
barrels
of
beer
able
to
snatch
the
dinner
from
the
board
of
the
reaper
or
the
mower
and
to
convey
it
to
the
of
the
hessian
or
hanoverian
grenadier
able
to
take
away
the
wool
that
ought
to
give
warmth
to
the
bodies
of
those
who
rear
the
sheep
and
put
it
on
the
backs
of
those
who
carry
arms
to
keep
the
poor
shepherds
in
order
i
have
never
been
able
clearly
to
comprehend
what
the
beastly
scotch
mean
by
their
national
wealth
but
as
far
as
i
can
understand
them
this
is
their
meaning
that
national
wealth
means
that
which
is
of
the
products
of
the
country
over
and
above
what
is
or
by
those
whose
labour
causes
the
products
to
be
this
being
the
notion
it
follows
of
course
that
the
poor
devils
you
can
screw
the
products
out
of
the
the
nation
is
this
is
too
the
notion
of
burdett
as
expressed
in
his
silly
and
most
nasty
musty
aristocratic
speech
of
last
session
what
then
is
to
be
done
with
this
who
is
to
have
it
is
it
to
go
to
pensioners
placemen
people
soldiers
gendarmerie
and
in
short
to
whole
millions
do
no
work
at
is
this
a
cause
of
national
wealth
is
a
nation
made
by
taking
the
food
and
clothing
from
those
who
create
them
and
giving
them
to
those
who
do
nothing
of
any
use
aye
but
this
may
be
given
to
and
to
those
who
supply
the
with
what
they
want
besides
food
oh
but
this
is
merely
an
of
one
valuable
thing
for
another
valuable
thing
it
is
an
exchange
of
labour
in
wiltshire
for
labour
in
lancashire
and
upon
the
whole
here
is
no
if
the
produce
be
exported
it
is
the
same
thing
it
is
an
exchange
of
one
sort
of
labour
for
another
but
is
that
there
is
not
an
exchange
that
those
who
labour
no
matter
in
what
way
have
a
large
part
of
the
fruit
of
their
labour
taken
away
and
receive
nothing
in
exchange
if
the
of
this
valley
of
avon
were
given
by
the
farmers
to
the
weavers
in
lancashire
to
the
iron
and
steel
chaps
of
warwickshire
and
to
other
makers
or
sellers
of
useful
things
there
would
come
an
abundance
of
all
these
useful
things
into
this
valley
from
lancashire
and
other
parts
but
if
as
is
the
case
the
goes
to
the
the
the
soldiers
the
lord
and
lady
and
master
and
miss
pensioners
and
sinecure
people
if
the
go
to
them
as
a
very
great
part
of
it
does
nothing
not
even
the
parings
of
one
nails
can
come
back
to
the
valley
in
exchange
and
can
this
operation
then
add
to
the
national
wealth
it
adds
to
the
wealth
of
those
who
carry
on
the
affairs
of
state
it
fills
their
pockets
those
of
their
relatives
and
dependents
it
fattens
all
but
it
can
give
no
wealth
to
the
nation
which
means
the
whole
of
the
people
national
wealth
means
the
commonwealth
or
commonweal
and
these
mean
the
general
good
or
happiness
of
the
people
and
the
safety
and
honour
of
the
state
and
these
are
not
to
be
secured
by
robbing
those
who
labour
in
order
to
support
a
large
part
of
the
community
in
idleness
devizes
is
the
to
which
the
corn
goes
from
the
greater
part
of
this
valley
if
when
a
of
wheat
goes
off
in
the
morning
the
wagon
came
back
at
night
loaded
with
cloth
salt
or
something
or
other
equal
in
value
to
the
wheat
except
what
might
be
necessary
to
leave
with
the
shopkeeper
as
his
profit
then
indeed
the
people
might
see
the
wagon
go
off
without
tears
in
their
eyes
but
now
they
see
it
go
to
carry
away
and
to
bring
next
to
nothing
in
return
what
a
a
head
must
have
before
it
can
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
nation
gains
in
wealth
by
the
government
being
able
to
cause
the
work
to
be
done
by
those
who
have
hardly
any
share
in
the
fruit
of
the
labour
what
a
such
a
head
must
have
the
scotch
who
seem
all
to
have
been
by
nature
formed
for
have
an
insuperable
objection
to
all
those
establishments
and
customs
which
occasion
they
call
them
a
great
hindrance
a
great
bar
to
industry
a
great
drawback
from
national
wealth
i
wish
each
of
these
unfeeling
fellows
had
a
spade
put
into
his
hand
for
ten
days
only
ten
days
and
that
he
were
compelled
to
dig
only
just
as
much
as
one
of
the
common
labourers
at
fulham
the
metaphysical
gentlemen
would
i
believe
soon
discover
the
of
but
should
men
why
should
men
work
why
i
ask
should
they
work
incessantly
if
working
part
of
the
days
of
the
week
be
sufficient
why
should
the
people
at
milton
for
instance
work
incessantly
when
they
now
raise
food
and
clothing
and
fuel
and
every
necessary
to
maintain
well
five
times
their
number
why
should
they
not
have
some
holidays
and
pray
say
thou
conceited
scotch
feelosofer
how
the
national
wealth
can
be
increased
by
making
these
people
work
incessantly
that
they
may
raise
food
and
clothing
to
go
to
feed
and
clothe
people
who
do
not
work
at
all
the
state
of
this
valley
seems
to
illustrate
the
infamous
and
really
diabolical
assertion
of
malthus
which
is
that
the
human
kind
have
a
natural
tendency
increase
beyond
the
means
of
sustenance
for
hence
all
the
schemes
of
this
and
the
other
scotch
writers
for
what
they
call
checking
population
now
look
at
this
valley
of
avon
here
the
people
raise
nearly
twenty
times
as
much
food
and
clothing
as
they
consume
they
raise
five
times
as
much
even
according
to
my
scale
of
living
they
have
been
doing
this
for
many
many
years
they
have
been
doing
it
for
several
generations
where
then
is
their
natural
tendency
to
increase
beyond
the
means
of
sustenance
for
them
beyond
indeed
the
means
of
that
sustenance
which
a
system
like
this
will
leave
them
say
that
sawneys
and
i
agree
with
you
far
beyond
the
means
that
the
taxing
and
monopolizing
system
will
leave
in
their
hands
that
is
very
true
for
it
leaves
them
nothing
but
the
scale
of
the
they
must
cease
to
breed
at
all
or
they
must
exceed
this
mark
but
the
give
them
their
fair
share
of
its
products
will
always
give
sustenance
in
sufficiency
to
those
who
apply
to
it
by
skilful
and
diligent
labour
the
villages
down
this
valley
of
avon
and
indeed
it
was
the
same
in
almost
every
part
of
this
county
and
in
the
north
and
west
of
hampshire
also
used
to
have
great
employment
for
the
women
and
children
in
the
carding
and
spinning
of
wool
for
the
making
of
this
was
a
very
general
employment
for
the
women
and
girls
but
it
is
now
wholly
gone
and
this
has
made
a
vast
change
in
the
condition
of
the
people
and
in
the
state
of
property
and
of
manners
and
of
morals
in
i
wrote
and
published
a
to
the
the
object
of
which
was
to
combat
their
hostility
to
the
use
of
machinery
the
arguments
i
there
made
use
of
were
general
i
took
the
matter
in
the
abstract
the
were
all
correct
enough
but
their
application
can
not
be
universal
and
we
have
a
case
here
before
us
at
this
moment
which
in
my
opinion
shows
that
the
mechanic
inventions
pushed
to
the
extent
that
they
have
been
have
been
productive
of
great
calamity
to
this
country
and
that
they
will
be
productive
of
still
greater
calamity
unless
indeed
it
be
their
brilliant
destiny
to
be
the
immediate
cause
of
putting
an
end
to
the
present
system
the
greater
part
of
manufactures
consists
of
and
now
if
by
using
a
machine
we
can
get
our
coat
with
less
labour
than
we
got
it
before
the
machine
is
a
desirable
thing
but
then
mind
we
must
have
the
machine
at
home
and
we
ourselves
must
have
the
profit
of
it
for
if
the
machine
be
elsewhere
if
it
be
worked
by
other
hands
if
other
persons
have
the
profit
of
it
and
if
in
consequence
of
the
existence
of
the
machine
we
have
hands
at
home
who
have
nothing
to
do
and
whom
we
must
keep
then
the
machine
is
an
injury
to
us
however
advantageous
it
may
be
to
those
who
use
it
and
whatever
traffic
it
may
occasion
with
foreign
states
such
is
the
case
with
regard
to
this
the
machines
are
at
warminster
bradford
westbury
and
trowbridge
and
here
are
some
of
the
hands
in
the
valley
of
avon
this
valley
raises
food
and
clothing
but
in
order
to
raise
them
it
must
have
these
are
absolutely
necessary
for
without
them
this
rich
and
beautiful
valley
becomes
worth
nothing
except
to
wild
animals
and
their
pursuers
the
labourers
are
and
women
and
girls
occasionally
but
the
men
and
the
boys
are
as
necessary
as
the
light
of
day
or
as
the
air
and
the
water
now
if
beastly
malthus
or
any
of
his
nasty
disciples
can
discover
a
mode
of
having
men
and
boys
without
having
women
and
girls
then
certainly
the
machine
must
be
a
good
thing
but
if
this
valley
must
absolutely
have
the
women
and
the
girls
then
the
machine
by
leaving
them
with
nothing
to
do
is
a
mischievous
thing
and
a
producer
of
most
dreadful
misery
what
with
regard
to
the
poor
is
the
great
complaint
now
why
that
the
does
not
receive
the
same
or
anything
like
the
same
wages
as
the
man
aye
it
is
the
wife
and
girls
that
are
the
burden
and
to
be
sure
a
burden
they
must
be
under
a
system
of
taxation
like
the
present
and
with
no
work
to
do
therefore
whatever
may
be
saved
in
labour
by
the
machine
is
no
benefit
but
an
injury
to
the
mass
of
the
people
for
in
fact
all
that
the
women
and
children
earned
was
so
much
clear
addition
to
what
the
family
earns
now
the
greatest
part
of
the
clothing
in
the
united
states
of
america
is
made
by
the
farm
women
and
girls
they
do
almost
the
whole
of
it
and
all
that
they
do
is
done
at
home
to
be
sure
they
might
buy
cheap
but
they
must
buy
for
less
than
nothing
if
it
would
not
answer
their
purpose
to
the
things
the
survey
of
this
valley
is
i
think
the
finest
answer
in
the
world
to
the
emigration
committee
fellows
and
to
jerry
curteis
one
of
the
members
for
sussex
who
has
been
giving
evidence
before
it
i
shall
find
out
when
i
can
get
to
see
the
what
this
emigration
committee
would
be
i
remember
that
last
winter
a
young
woman
complained
to
one
of
the
police
justices
that
the
overseers
of
some
parish
were
going
to
transport
her
orphan
brother
to
canada
because
he
became
chargeable
to
their
parish
i
remember
also
that
the
justice
said
that
the
intention
of
the
overseers
was
premature
for
that
the
bill
had
not
yet
passed
this
was
rather
an
ugly
story
and
i
do
think
that
we
shall
find
that
there
have
been
and
are
some
pretty
propositions
before
this
committee
we
shall
see
all
about
the
matter
however
and
when
we
get
the
transporting
project
fairly
before
us
shall
we
not
then
loudly
proclaim
the
envy
of
surrounding
nations
and
admiration
of
the
world
but
what
ignorance
impudence
and
insolence
must
those
base
wretches
have
who
propose
to
transport
the
labouring
people
as
being
too
numerous
while
the
produce
which
is
obtained
by
their
labour
is
more
than
sufficient
for
three
four
or
five
or
even
ten
times
their
numbers
jerry
curteis
who
has
it
seems
been
a
famous
witness
on
this
occasion
says
that
the
in
many
cases
amount
to
as
much
as
the
rent
well
and
what
then
jerry
the
rent
may
be
high
enough
too
and
the
farmer
may
afford
to
pay
them
both
for
a
very
large
part
of
what
you
call
ought
to
be
called
but
at
any
rate
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
the
necessity
of
emigration
to
make
out
such
necessity
you
must
make
out
that
you
have
more
mouths
than
the
produce
of
the
parish
will
feed
do
then
jerry
tell
us
another
time
a
little
about
the
quantity
of
food
annually
raised
in
four
or
five
adjoining
parishes
for
is
it
not
something
rather
damnable
jerry
to
talk
of
englishmen
on
account
of
the
of
their
when
the
fact
is
notorious
that
their
labour
produces
five
or
ten
times
as
much
food
and
raiment
as
they
and
their
families
consume
however
to
drop
jerry
for
the
present
the
baseness
the
foul
the
stinking
the
carrion
baseness
of
the
fellows
that
call
themselves
country
gentlemen
is
that
the
wretches
while
railing
against
the
poor
and
the
while
affecting
to
believe
that
the
poor
are
wicked
and
lazy
while
complaining
that
the
poor
the
working
people
are
too
numerous
and
that
the
country
villages
are
too
populous
the
carrion
baseness
of
these
wretches
is
that
while
they
are
thus
with
regard
to
the
working
and
poor
people
they
never
even
whisper
a
word
against
pensioners
placemen
soldiers
parsons
fundholders
or
they
say
not
a
word
against
the
prolific
to
whom
they
give
a
premium
for
breeding
while
they
want
to
check
the
population
of
labourers
they
never
say
a
word
about
the
too
great
populousness
of
the
wen
nor
about
that
of
liverpool
manchester
cheltenham
and
the
like
oh
they
are
the
most
cowardly
the
very
basest
the
most
scandalously
base
reptiles
that
ever
were
warmed
into
life
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
taking
my
leave
of
this
beautiful
vale
i
have
to
express
my
deep
shame
as
an
englishman
at
beholding
the
general
of
those
who
cause
this
vale
to
produce
such
quantities
of
food
and
raiment
this
is
i
verily
believe
it
the
used
labouring
people
upon
the
face
of
the
dogs
and
hogs
and
horses
are
treated
with
more
civility
and
as
to
food
and
lodging
how
gladly
would
the
labourers
change
with
them
this
state
of
things
never
can
continue
many
years
some
means
or
there
must
be
an
end
to
it
and
my
firm
belief
is
that
that
end
will
be
dreadful
in
the
meanwhile
i
see
and
i
see
it
with
pleasure
that
the
common
people
know
that
they
are
ill
used
and
that
they
cordially
most
cordially
hate
those
who
them
during
the
day
i
crossed
the
river
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
times
and
in
such
hot
weather
it
was
very
pleasant
to
be
so
much
amongst
meadows
and
water
i
had
been
at
netheravon
about
eighteen
years
ago
where
i
had
seen
a
great
quantity
of
hares
it
is
a
place
belonging
to
hicks
beach
or
beech
who
was
once
a
member
of
parliament
i
found
the
place
altered
a
good
deal
out
of
repair
the
gates
rather
rotten
and
a
very
bad
sign
the
roof
of
the
falling
in
there
is
a
church
at
this
village
of
netheravon
large
enough
to
hold
a
thousand
or
two
of
people
and
the
whole
parish
contains
only
souls
men
women
and
children
this
netheravon
was
formerly
a
great
lordship
and
in
the
parish
there
were
three
considerable
besides
the
one
near
the
church
these
mansions
are
all
down
now
and
it
is
curious
enough
to
see
the
former
become
together
with
other
changes
all
tending
to
prove
the
gradual
decay
in
all
except
what
appertains
merely
to
as
a
thing
of
production
for
the
distant
market
but
indeed
the
people
and
the
means
of
enjoyment
must
go
away
they
are
away
by
the
taxes
and
the
how
are
thousand
new
to
be
all
at
once
building
in
the
wen
without
people
and
food
and
raiment
going
from
this
valley
towards
the
wen
it
must
be
so
and
this
unnatural
this
dilapidating
this
ruining
and
debasing
work
must
go
on
until
that
which
produces
it
be
destroyed
when
i
came
down
to
stratford
dean
i
wanted
to
go
across
to
laverstoke
which
lay
to
my
left
of
salisbury
but
just
on
the
side
of
the
road
here
at
stratford
dean
rises
the
it
is
very
lofty
it
was
originally
a
hill
in
an
irregular
sort
of
shape
but
it
was
so
altered
by
the
romans
or
by
somebody
that
the
upper
parts
of
the
hill
now
when
seen
from
a
distance
somewhat
resemble
laid
one
upon
another
the
bottom
one
a
great
deal
broader
than
the
next
and
the
top
one
like
a
stilton
cheese
in
proportion
to
a
gloucester
one
i
resolved
to
ride
over
this
accursed
hill
as
i
was
going
up
a
field
towards
it
i
met
a
man
going
home
from
work
i
asked
how
he
he
said
very
badly
i
asked
him
what
was
the
cause
of
it
he
said
the
what
said
i
was
there
ever
a
finer
summer
a
finer
harvest
and
is
there
not
an
in
every
ah
said
he
make
it
bad
for
poor
people
for
all
that
said
i
who
is
he
was
silent
oh
no
no
my
friend
said
i
it
is
not
it
is
that
accursed
hill
that
has
robbed
you
of
the
supper
that
you
ought
to
find
smoking
on
the
table
when
you
get
home
i
gave
him
the
price
of
a
pot
of
beer
and
on
i
went
leaving
the
poor
dejected
assemblage
of
skin
and
bone
to
wonder
at
my
words
the
hill
is
very
steep
and
i
dismounted
and
led
my
horse
up
being
as
near
to
the
top
as
i
could
conveniently
get
i
stood
a
little
while
reflecting
not
so
much
on
the
changes
which
that
hill
had
seen
as
on
the
changes
the
terrible
changes
which
in
all
human
probability
it
had
to
and
which
it
would
have
greatly
to
it
was
impossible
to
stand
on
this
accursed
spot
without
swelling
with
indignation
against
the
base
and
plundering
and
murderous
sons
of
corruption
i
have
often
wished
and
i
speaking
out
loud
expressed
the
wish
now
may
that
man
perish
for
ever
and
ever
who
having
the
power
neglects
to
bring
to
justice
the
perjured
the
suborning
the
insolent
and
perfidious
miscreants
who
openly
sell
their
country
rights
and
their
own
souls
from
the
accursed
hill
i
went
to
laverstoke
where
jemmy
burrough
as
they
call
him
here
the
judge
lives
i
have
not
heard
much
about
jemmy
since
he
tried
and
condemned
the
two
young
men
who
had
wounded
the
of
ashton
smith
and
lord
palmerston
his
lordship
palmerston
is
i
see
making
a
tolerable
figure
in
the
newspapers
as
a
i
got
into
salisbury
about
seven
less
tired
than
i
recollect
ever
to
have
been
after
so
long
a
ride
for
including
my
several
crossings
of
the
river
and
my
deviations
to
look
at
churches
and
and
i
think
i
must
have
ridden
nearly
forty
miles
ride
from
salisbury
to
warminster
from
warminster
to
frome
from
frome

from
devizes

be
gone

we
may
set
forth
wheat

thursday

this
place
which
is
one
of
the
rotten
boroughs
of
wiltshire
and
which
was
formerly
a
considerable
town
is
now
but
a
very
miserable
affair
yesterday
morning
i
went
into
the
cathedral
at
salisbury
about
when
i
got
into
the
nave
of
the
church
and
was
looking
up
and
admiring
the
columns
and
the
roof
i
heard
a
sort
of
in
some
place
which
appeared
to
be
in
the
transept
of
the
building
i
wondered
what
it
was
and
made
my
way
towards
the
place
whence
the
noise
appeared
to
issue
as
i
approached
it
the
noise
seemed
to
grow
louder
at
last
i
thought
i
could
distinguish
the
sounds
of
the
human
voice
this
encouraged
me
to
proceed
and
still
following
the
sound
i
at
last
turned
in
at
a
doorway
to
my
left
where
i
found
a
priest
and
his
congregation
assembled
it
was
a
parson
of
some
sort
with
a
white
covering
on
him
and
five
women
and
four
men
when
i
arrived
there
were
five
couple
of
us
i
joined
the
congregation
until
they
came
to
the
and
then
being
monstrously
hungry
i
did
not
think
myself
bound
to
stay
any
longer
i
wonder
what
the
founders
would
say
if
they
could
rise
from
the
grave
and
see
such
a
congregation
as
this
in
this
most
magnificent
and
beautiful
cathedral
i
wonder
what
they
would
say
if
they
could
know
what
the
endowments
of
this
cathedral
are
now
applied
and
above
all
things
i
wonder
what
they
would
say
if
they
could
see
the
labourers
that
now
minister
to
the
luxuries
of
those
who
wallow
in
the
wealth
of
those
endowments
there
is
one
thing
at
any
rate
that
might
be
abstained
from
by
those
that
revel
in
the
riches
of
those
endowments
namely
to
abuse
and
blackguard
those
of
our
forefathers
from
whom
the
endowments
came
and
who
erected
the
edifice
and
carried
so
far
towards
the
skies
that
beautiful
and
matchless
spire
of
which
the
present
possessors
have
the
impudence
to
boast
while
they
represent
as
ignorant
and
benighted
creatures
those
who
conceived
the
grand
design
and
who
executed
the
scientific
and
costly
work
these
fellows
in
big
white
wigs
of
the
size
of
half
a
bushel
have
the
audacity
even
within
the
walls
of
the
cathedrals
themselves
to
rail
against
those
who
founded
them
and
rennell
and
sturges
while
they
were
actually
literally
fattening
on
the
spoils
of
the
monastery
of
swithin
at
winchester
were
publishing
abusive
pamphlets
against
that
catholic
religion
which
had
given
them
their
very
bread
for
my
part
i
could
not
look
up
at
the
spire
and
the
whole
of
the
church
at
salisbury
without
that
i
lived
in
degenerate
times
such
a
thing
never
could
be
made
we
that
as
we
look
at
the
building
it
really
does
appear
that
if
our
forefathers
had
not
made
these
buildings
we
should
have
forgotten
before
now
what
the
christian
religion
was
at
salisbury
or
very
near
to
it
four
other
rivers
fall
into
the
avon
the
wyly
river
the
nadder
the
born
and
another
little
river
that
comes
from
norrington
these
all
become
one
at
last
just
below
salisbury
and
then
under
the
name
of
the
avon
wind
along
down
and
fall
into
the
sea
at
christchurch
in
coming
from
salisbury
i
came
up
the
road
which
runs
pretty
nearly
parallel
with
the
river
wyly
which
river
rises
at
warminster
and
in
the
neighbourhood
this
river
runs
down
a
valley
miles
long
it
is
not
so
pretty
as
the
valley
of
the
avon
but
it
is
very
fine
in
its
whole
length
from
salisbury
to
this
place
heytesbury
here
are
watered
meadows
nearest
to
the
river
on
both
sides
then
the
gardens
the
houses
and
the
after
the
come
the
downs
but
generally
speaking
the
downs
are
not
so
bold
here
as
they
are
on
the
sides
of
the
avon
the
downs
do
not
come
out
in
promontories
so
often
as
they
do
on
the
sides
of
the
avon
the
if
i
may
so
express
it
is
not
so
deep
and
the
sides
of
it
not
so
steep
as
in
the
case
of
the
avon
but
the
villages
are
as
frequent
there
is
more
than
one
church
in
every
mile
and
there
has
been
a
due
proportion
of
mansion
houses
demolished
and
defaced
the
farms
are
very
fine
up
this
vale
and
the
meadows
particularly
at
a
place
called
stapleford
are
singularly
fine
they
had
just
been
mowed
at
stapleford
and
the
hay
carried
off
at
stapleford
there
is
a
little
cross
valley
running
up
between
two
hills
of
the
down
there
is
a
little
run
of
water
about
a
yard
wide
at
this
time
coming
down
this
little
vale
across
the
road
into
the
river
the
little
vale
runs
up
three
miles
it
does
not
appear
to
be
half
a
mile
wide
but
in
those
three
miles
there
are
four
churches
namely
stapleford
uppington
berwick
james
and
winterborne
stoke
the
present
population
of
these
four
villages
is
souls
men
women
and
children
the
whole
of
whom
could
very
conveniently
be
seated
in
the
chancel
of
the
church
at
stapleford
indeed
the
church
and
parish
of
uppington
seem
to
have
been
united
with
one
of
the
other
parishes
like
the
parish
in
kent
which
was
united
with
north
cray
and
not
a
single
house
of
which
now
remains
what
were
these
four
churches
within
the
distance
of
three
miles
there
are
three
parsonage
houses
still
remaining
but
and
it
is
a
very
curious
fact
neither
of
them
good
enough
for
the
parson
to
live
in
here
are
seven
hundred
and
sixty
souls
to
be
taken
care
of
but
there
is
no
parsonage
house
for
a
to
stay
in
or
at
least
that
he
stay
in
and
all
the
three
parsonages
are
in
the
return
laid
before
parliament
represented
to
be
no
better
than
miserable
cottages
though
the
parish
of
winterborne
stoke
has
a
church
sufficient
to
contain
two
or
three
thousand
people
the
truth
is
that
the
parsons
have
been
receiving
the
revenues
of
the
livings
and
have
been
suffering
the
parsonage
houses
to
fall
into
decay
here
were
two
or
three
mansion
houses
which
are
also
gone
even
from
the
sides
of
this
little
run
of
water
has
been
exceedingly
hot
hotter
i
think
for
a
short
time
than
i
ever
felt
it
in
england
before
in
coming
through
a
village
called
wishford
and
mounting
a
little
hill
i
thought
the
heat
upon
my
back
was
as
great
as
i
had
ever
felt
it
in
my
life
there
were
thunder
storms
about
and
it
had
rained
at
wishford
a
little
before
i
came
to
it
my
next
village
was
one
that
i
had
lived
in
for
a
short
time
when
i
was
only
about
ten
or
eleven
years
of
age
i
had
been
sent
down
with
a
horse
from
farnham
and
i
remember
that
i
went
by
and
rode
up
and
looked
at
the
stones
from
i
went
to
the
village
of
steeple
langford
where
i
remained
from
the
month
of
june
till
the
fall
of
the
year
i
remembered
the
beautiful
villages
up
and
down
this
valley
i
also
remembered
very
well
that
the
women
at
steeple
langford
used
to
card
and
spin
dyed
wool
i
was
therefore
somewhat
filled
with
curiosity
to
see
this
steeple
langford
again
and
indeed
it
was
the
recollection
of
this
village
that
made
me
take
a
ride
into
wiltshire
this
summer
i
have
i
dare
say
a
thousand
times
talked
about
this
steeple
langford
and
about
the
beautiful
farms
and
meadows
along
this
valley
i
have
talked
of
these
to
my
children
a
great
many
times
and
i
formed
the
design
of
letting
two
of
them
see
this
valley
this
year
and
to
go
through
warminster
to
stroud
and
so
on
to
gloucester
and
hereford
but
when
i
got
to
everley
i
found
that
they
would
never
get
along
fast
enough
to
get
into
herefordshire
in
time
for
what
they
intended
so
that
i
parted
from
them
in
the
manner
i
have
before
described
i
was
resolved
however
to
see
steeple
langford
myself
and
i
was
impatient
to
get
to
it
hoping
to
find
a
and
a
stable
to
put
my
horse
in
to
protect
him
for
a
while
against
the
flies
which
tormented
him
to
such
a
degree
that
to
ride
him
was
work
as
hard
as
threshing
when
i
got
to
steeple
langford
i
found
no
and
i
found
it
a
much
more
miserable
place
than
i
had
remembered
it
the
to
which
it
owed
its
distinctive
appellation
was
gone
and
the
place
altogether
seemed
to
me
to
be
very
much
altered
for
the
worse
a
little
further
on
however
i
came
to
a
very
famous
inn
called
deptford
inn
which
is
in
the
parish
of
wyly
i
stayed
at
this
inn
till
about
four
in
the
afternoon
i
remembered
wyly
very
well
and
thought
it
a
gay
place
when
i
was
a
boy
i
remembered
a
very
beautiful
garden
belonging
to
a
rich
farmer
and
miller
i
went
to
see
it
but
alas
though
the
statues
in
the
water
and
on
the
were
still
remaining
everything
seemed
to
be
in
a
state
of
perfect
carelessness
and
neglect
the
living
of
this
parish
of
wyly
was
lately
owned
by
dampier
a
brother
of
the
judge
who
lived
at
and
i
believe
had
the
living
of
meon
stoke
in
hampshire
this
fellow
i
believe
never
saw
the
parish
of
wyly
but
once
though
it
must
have
yielded
him
a
pretty
good
fleece
it
is
a
rectory
and
the
great
tithes
must
be
worth
i
should
think
six
or
seven
hundred
pounds
a
year
at
the
least
it
is
a
part
of
our
system
to
have
certain
who
have
no
particular
merit
but
who
are
to
be
maintained
without
why
or
wherefore
at
the
public
expense
in
some
shape
or
under
some
name
or
other
it
matters
not
much
what
shape
or
what
name
if
you
look
through
the
old
list
of
pensioners
sinecurists
parsons
and
the
like
you
will
find
the
same
names
everlastingly
recurring
they
seem
to
be
a
sort
of
creatures
that
have
an
in
the
public
like
the
maggots
that
some
people
have
in
their
skins
this
family
of
dampier
seems
to
be
one
of
these
what
in
god
name
should
have
made
one
of
these
a
bishop
and
the
other
a
judge
i
never
heard
of
the
smallest
particle
of
talent
that
either
of
them
possessed
this
rector
of
wyly
was
another
of
them
there
was
no
harm
in
them
that
i
know
of
beyond
that
of
living
upon
the
public
but
where
were
their
merits
they
had
none
to
distinguish
them
and
to
entitle
them
to
the
great
sums
they
received
and
under
any
other
system
than
such
a
system
as
this
they
would
in
all
human
probability
have
been
gentlemen
servants
or
little
shopkeepers
i
dare
say
there
is
some
of
the
left
and
if
there
be
i
would
pledge
my
existence
that
they
are
in
some
shape
or
other
feeding
upon
the
public
however
thus
it
must
be
until
that
change
come
which
will
put
an
end
to
men
paying
in
tax
upon
a
pot
of
beer
this
deptford
inn
was
a
famous
place
of
meeting
for
the
in
glorious
times
when
wheat
was
twenty
shillings
a
bushel
and
when
a
man
could
be
crammed
into
gaol
for
years
for
only
awry
this
inn
was
a
glorious
place
in
the
days
of
peg
nicholson
and
her
knights
strangely
altered
now
the
shape
of
the
garden
shows
you
what
revelry
used
to
be
carried
on
here
peel
bill
gave
this
inn
and
all
belonging
to
it
a
terrible
souse
the
unfeeling
brutes
who
used
to
brandish
their
swords
and
swagger
about
at
the
news
of
what
was
called
a
victory
have
now
to
lower
their
scale
in
clothing
in
drink
in
eating
in
dress
in
horseflesh
and
everything
else
they
are
now
a
lower
sort
of
men
than
they
were
they
look
at
their
rusty
sword
and
their
old
dusty
helmet
and
their
once
gay
regimental
jacket
they
do
not
hang
these
up
now
in
the
parlour
for
everybody
to
see
them
they
hang
them
up
in
their
bedrooms
or
in
a
cockloft
and
when
they
meet
their
eye
they
look
at
them
as
a
cow
does
at
a
bastard
calf
or
as
the
bridegroom
does
at
a
girl
that
the
overseers
are
about
to
compel
him
to
marry
if
their
children
should
happen
to
see
these
implements
of
war
twenty
or
thirty
years
hence
they
will
certainly
think
that
their
fathers
were
the
greatest
fools
that
ever
walked
the
face
of
the
earth
and
that
will
be
a
most
filial
and
charitable
way
of
thinking
of
them
for
it
is
not
from
ignorance
that
they
have
sinned
but
from
excessive
baseness
and
when
any
of
them
now
complain
of
those
acts
of
the
government
which
strip
them
as
the
late
order
in
council
does
of
a
fifth
part
of
their
property
in
an
hour
let
them
recollect
their
own
base
and
malignant
conduct
towards
those
persecuted
reformers
who
if
they
had
not
been
suppressed
by
these
very
yeomen
would
long
ago
have
put
an
end
to
the
cause
of
that
ruin
of
which
these
yeomen
now
complain
when
they
complain
of
their
ruin
let
them
remember
the
toasts
which
they
drank
in
times
let
them
remember
their
base
and
insulting
exultations
on
the
occasion
of
the
of
august
at
manchester
let
them
remember
their
cowardly
abuse
of
men
who
were
endeavouring
to
free
their
country
from
that
horrible
scourge
which
they
themselves
now
feel
just
close
by
this
deptford
inn
is
the
of
the
farm
where
that
gourlay
lived
who
has
long
been
making
a
noise
in
the
court
of
chancery
and
who
is
now
i
believe
confined
in
some
place
or
other
for
having
assaulted
brougham
this
fellow
who
is
confined
the
newspapers
tell
us
on
a
charge
of
being
insane
is
certainly
one
of
the
most
malignant
devils
that
i
ever
knew
anything
of
in
my
life
he
went
to
canada
about
the
time
that
i
went
last
to
the
united
states
he
got
into
a
quarrel
with
the
government
there
about
something
i
know
not
what
he
came
to
see
me
at
my
house
in
the
neighbourhood
of
new
york
just
before
i
came
home
he
told
me
his
canada
story
i
showed
him
all
the
kindness
in
my
power
and
he
went
away
knowing
that
i
was
just
then
coming
to
england
i
had
hardly
got
home
before
the
scotch
newspapers
contained
communications
from
a
person
pretending
to
derive
his
information
from
gourlay
relating
to
what
gourlay
had
described
as
having
passed
between
him
and
me
and
which
description
was
a
tissue
of
most
abominable
falsehoods
all
having
a
direct
tendency
to
do
injury
to
me
who
had
never
either
by
word
or
deed
done
anything
that
could
possibly
have
a
tendency
to
do
injury
to
this
gourlay
what
the
vile
scotch
newspapers
had
begun
the
malignant
reptile
himself
continued
after
his
return
to
england
and
in
an
address
to
lord
bathurst
endeavoured
to
make
his
court
to
the
government
by
the
most
foul
false
and
detestable
slanders
upon
me
from
whom
observe
he
had
never
received
any
injury
or
attempt
at
injury
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
whom
he
had
visited
to
whose
house
he
had
gone
of
his
own
accord
and
that
too
as
he
said
out
of
for
me
endeavoured
i
say
to
make
his
court
to
the
government
by
the
most
abominable
slanders
against
me
he
is
now
even
now
putting
forth
under
the
form
of
letters
to
me
a
revival
of
what
he
pretends
was
a
that
passed
between
us
at
my
house
near
new
york
even
if
what
he
says
were
true
none
but
caitiffs
as
base
as
those
who
conduct
the
english
newspapers
would
give
circulation
to
his
letters
containing
as
they
must
the
substance
of
a
conversation
purely
private
but
i
never
had
any
conversation
with
him
i
never
talked
to
him
at
all
about
the
things
that
he
is
now
bringing
forward
i
heard
the
fellow
stories
about
canada
i
thought
he
told
me
lies
and
besides
i
did
not
care
a
straw
whether
his
stories
were
true
or
not
i
looked
upon
him
as
a
sort
of
gambling
adventurer
but
i
treated
him
as
is
the
fashion
of
the
country
in
which
i
was
with
great
civility
and
hospitality
there
are
two
fellows
of
the
name
of
jacob
and
johnson
at
winchester
and
two
fellows
at
salisbury
of
the
name
of
brodie
and
dowding
these
reptiles
publish
each
couple
of
them
a
newspaper
and
in
these
newspapers
they
seem
to
take
particular
delight
in
calumniating
me
the
two
winchester
fellows
insert
the
letters
of
this
half
crazy
half
cunning
scotchman
gourlay
the
other
fellows
insert
still
viler
slanders
and
if
i
had
seen
one
of
their
papers
before
i
left
salisbury
which
i
have
seen
since
i
certainly
would
have
given
brodie
something
to
make
him
remember
me
this
fellow
who
was
a
little
but
a
short
while
ago
is
now
it
seems
a
maker
as
well
as
a
newspaper
maker
stop
master
brodie
till
i
go
to
salisbury
again
and
see
whether
i
do
not
give
you
a
even
such
as
you
did
not
receive
during
the
late
run
gourlay
amongst
other
whims
took
it
into
his
head
to
write
against
the
poor
laws
saying
that
they
were
a
bad
thing
he
found
however
at
last
that
they
were
necessary
to
keep
him
from
starving
for
he
came
down
to
wyly
three
or
four
years
ago
and
threw
himself
upon
the
parish
the
overseers
who
recollected
what
a
swaggering
blade
it
was
when
it
came
here
to
teach
the
hoo
to
farm
mon
did
not
see
the
sense
of
keeping
him
like
a
gentleman
so
they
set
him
to
crack
stones
upon
the
highway
and
that
set
him
off
again
pretty
quickly
the
farm
that
he
rented
is
a
very
fine
farm
with
a
fine
large
to
it
it
is
looked
upon
as
one
of
the
best
farms
in
the
country
the
present
occupier
is
a
farmer
born
in
the
neighbourhood
a
man
such
as
ought
to
occupy
it
and
gourlay
who
came
here
with
his
scotch
impudence
to
teach
others
how
to
farm
is
much
about
where
and
how
he
ought
to
be
jacob
and
johnson
of
winchester
know
perfectly
well
that
all
the
fellow
says
about
me
is
lies
they
know
also
that
their
parson
readers
know
that
it
is
a
mass
of
lies
they
further
know
that
the
parsons
know
that
they
know
that
it
is
a
mass
of
lies
but
they
know
that
their
paper
will
sell
the
better
for
that
they
know
that
to
circulate
lies
about
me
will
get
them
money
and
this
is
what
they
do
it
for
and
such
is
the
character
of
english
newspapers
and
of
a
great
part
of
the
readers
of
those
newspapers
therefore
when
i
hear
of
people
suffering
when
i
hear
of
people
being
ruined
when
i
hear
of
unfortunate
families
when
i
hear
a
talk
of
this
kind
i
stop
before
i
either
express
or
feel
compassion
to
ascertain
and
the
sufferers
are
and
whether
they
have
or
have
not
participated
in
or
approved
of
acts
like
those
of
jacob
and
johnson
and
brodie
and
dowding
for
if
they
have
if
they
have
malignantly
calumniated
those
who
have
been
labouring
to
prevent
their
ruin
and
misery
then
a
crushed
or
spider
or
eft
or
toad
is
as
much
entitled
to
the
compassion
of
a
just
and
sensible
man
let
the
reptiles
perish
it
would
be
injustice
it
would
be
to
fly
in
the
face
of
morality
and
religion
to
express
sorrow
for
their
ruin
they
themselves
have
felt
for
no
man
and
for
the
wife
and
children
of
no
man
if
that
man
public
virtues
thwarted
their
own
selfish
views
or
even
excited
their
groundless
fears
they
have
signed
addresses
applauding
everything
tyrannical
and
inhuman
they
have
seemed
to
glory
in
the
shame
of
their
country
to
rejoice
in
its
degradation
and
even
to
exult
in
the
shedding
of
innocent
blood
if
these
things
did
but
tend
as
they
thought
to
give
them
permanent
security
in
the
enjoyment
of
their
unjust
gains
such
has
been
their
conduct
they
are
numerous
they
are
to
be
found
in
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
therefore
again
i
say
when
i
hear
of
ruin
or
misery
i
must
know
what
the
conduct
of
the
sufferers
has
been
before
i
bestow
my
compassion
wilts
friday
i
set
out
from
heytesbury
this
morning
about
six
last
night
before
i
went
to
bed
i
found
that
there
were
some
men
and
boys
in
the
house
who
had
come
all
the
way
from
bradford
about
twelve
miles
in
order
to
get
these
people
were
men
and
boys
that
had
been
employed
in
the
at
bradford
and
about
bradford
i
had
some
talk
with
some
of
these
nutters
and
i
am
quite
convinced
not
that
the
cloth
making
is
at
but
that
it
will
be
again
what
it
has
before
last
christmas
these
manufacturers
had
full
work
at
one
shilling
and
threepence
a
yard
at
weaving
they
have
now
a
quarter
work
at
one
shilling
a
yard
one
and
a
yard
for
this
weaving
has
been
given
at
all
times
within
the
memory
of
man
nothing
can
show
more
clearly
than
this
and
in
a
stronger
light
the
great
change
which
has
taken
place
in
the
of
there
was
a
turn
out
last
winter
when
the
price
was
reduced
to
a
shilling
a
yard
but
it
was
put
an
end
to
in
the
usual
way
the
constable
staff
the
bayonet
the
gaol
these
poor
nutters
were
extremely
ragged
i
saved
my
supper
and
i
fasted
instead
of
breakfasting
that
was
three
shillings
which
i
had
saved
and
i
added
five
to
them
with
a
resolution
to
save
them
afterwards
in
order
to
give
these
chaps
a
breakfast
for
once
in
their
lives
there
were
eight
of
them
six
men
and
two
boys
and
i
gave
them
two
quartern
loaves
two
pounds
of
cheese
and
eight
pints
of
strong
beer
the
fellows
were
very
thankful
but
the
conduct
of
the
landlord
and
landlady
pleased
me
exceedingly
when
i
came
to
pay
my
bill
they
had
said
nothing
about
my
bed
which
had
been
a
very
good
one
and
when
i
asked
why
they
had
not
put
the
bed
into
the
bill
they
said
they
would
not
charge
anything
for
the
bed
since
i
had
been
so
good
to
the
poor
men
yes
said
i
but
i
must
not
throw
the
expense
upon
you
i
had
no
supper
and
i
have
had
no
breakfast
and
therefore
i
am
not
called
upon
to
pay
for
them
but
have
the
bed
it
ended
by
my
paying
for
the
bed
and
coming
off
leaving
the
nutters
at
their
breakfast
and
very
much
delighted
with
the
landlord
and
his
wife
and
i
must
here
observe
that
i
have
pretty
generally
found
a
good
deal
of
compassion
for
the
poor
people
to
prevail
amongst
publicans
and
their
wives
from
heytesbury
to
warminster
is
a
part
of
the
country
singularly
bright
and
beautiful
from
salisbury
up
to
very
near
heytesbury
you
have
the
valley
as
before
described
by
me
meadows
next
the
water
then
arable
land
then
the
downs
but
when
you
come
to
heytesbury
and
indeed
a
little
before
in
looking
forward
you
see
the
vale
stretch
out
from
about
three
miles
wide
to
ten
miles
wide
from
high
land
to
high
land
from
a
hill
before
you
come
down
to
heytesbury
you
see
through
this
wide
opening
into
somersetshire
you
see
a
round
hill
rising
in
the
middle
of
the
opening
but
all
the
rest
a
flat
enclosed
country
and
apparently
full
of
wood
in
looking
back
down
this
vale
one
can
not
help
being
struck
with
the
innumerable
proofs
that
there
are
of
a
decline
in
point
of
population
in
the
first
place
there
are
parishes
each
of
which
takes
a
little
strip
across
the
valley
and
runs
up
through
the
arable
land
into
the
down
there
are
parish
churches
and
there
ought
to
be
as
many
but
seven
of
these
out
of
the
that
is
to
say
nearly
of
them
are
in
the
returns
laid
before
parliament
and
of
which
returns
i
shall
speak
more
particularly
stated
to
be
such
miserable
dwellings
as
to
be
unfit
for
a
parson
to
reside
in
two
of
them
however
are
gone
there
are
no
in
those
two
parishes
there
are
the
scites
there
are
the
glebes
but
the
houses
have
been
suffered
to
fall
down
and
to
be
totally
carried
away
the
tithes
remain
indeed
and
the
parson
sacks
the
amount
of
them
a
journeyman
parson
comes
and
works
in
three
or
four
churches
of
a
sunday
but
the
master
parson
is
not
there
he
generally
carries
away
the
produce
to
spend
it
in
london
at
bath
or
somewhere
else
to
show
off
his
daughters
and
the
overseers
that
is
to
say
the
farmers
manage
the
poor
in
their
own
way
instead
of
having
according
to
the
ancient
law
a
of
all
the
tithes
to
keep
them
with
the
falling
down
and
the
beggary
of
these
prove
beyond
all
question
the
decayed
state
of
the
population
and
indeed
the
are
gone
except
in
a
very
few
instances
there
are
but
five
left
that
i
could
perceive
all
the
way
from
salisbury
to
warminster
though
the
country
is
the
most
pleasant
that
can
be
imagined
here
is
water
here
are
meadows
plenty
of
fish
hares
and
partridges
in
abundance
and
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
destroy
them
here
are
shooting
coursing
hunting
hills
of
every
height
size
and
form
valleys
the
same
lofty
trees
and
rookeries
in
every
mile
roads
always
solid
and
good
always
pleasant
for
exercise
and
the
air
must
be
of
the
best
in
the
world
yet
it
is
manifest
that
of
the
mansions
have
been
swept
away
there
is
a
parliamentary
return
to
prove
that
nearly
a
third
of
the
parsonage
houses
have
become
beggarly
holes
or
have
disappeared
i
have
now
been
in
nearly
threescore
villages
and
in
twenty
or
thirty
or
forty
hamlets
of
wiltshire
and
i
do
not
know
that
i
have
been
in
one
however
small
in
which
i
did
not
see
a
house
or
two
and
sometimes
more
either
tumbled
down
or
beginning
to
tumble
down
it
is
impossible
for
the
eyes
of
man
to
be
fixed
on
a
finer
country
than
that
between
the
village
of
codford
and
the
town
of
warminster
and
it
is
not
very
easy
for
the
eyes
of
man
to
discover
labouring
people
more
miserable
there
are
two
villages
one
called
norton
bovant
and
the
other
bishopstrow
which
i
think
form
together
one
of
the
prettiest
spots
that
my
eyes
ever
beheld
the
former
village
belongs
to
bennet
the
member
for
the
county
who
has
a
mansion
there
in
which
two
of
his
sisters
live
i
am
told
there
is
a
farm
at
bishopstrow
standing
at
the
back
of
the
arable
land
up
in
a
vale
formed
by
two
very
lofty
hills
upon
each
of
which
there
was
formerly
a
roman
camp
in
consideration
of
which
farm
if
the
owner
would
give
it
to
me
i
would
almost
consent
to
let
ottiwell
wood
remain
quiet
in
his
seat
and
suffer
the
pretty
gentlemen
of
whitehall
to
go
on
without
note
or
comment
till
they
had
fairly
blowed
up
their
concern
the
is
surrounded
by
lofty
and
beautiful
trees
in
the
i
counted
ricks
of
one
sort
and
another
the
hills
shelter
the
house
and
the
yard
and
the
trees
most
completely
from
every
wind
but
the
south
the
arable
land
goes
down
before
the
house
and
spreads
along
the
edge
of
the
down
going
with
a
gentle
slope
down
to
the
meadows
so
that
going
along
the
turnpike
road
which
runs
between
the
lower
fields
of
the
arable
land
you
see
the
large
and
beautiful
flocks
of
sheep
upon
the
sides
of
the
down
while
the
are
up
to
their
eyes
in
grass
in
the
meadows
just
when
i
was
coming
along
here
the
sun
was
about
half
an
hour
high
it
shined
through
the
trees
most
brilliantly
and
to
crown
the
whole
i
met
just
as
i
was
entering
the
village
a
very
pretty
girl
who
was
apparently
going
a
gleaning
in
the
fields
i
asked
her
the
name
of
the
place
and
when
she
told
me
it
was
bishopstrow
she
pointed
to
the
situation
of
the
church
which
she
said
was
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
she
really
put
me
in
mind
of
the
pretty
girls
at
preston
who
spat
upon
the
individual
of
the
derby
family
and
i
made
her
a
bow
accordingly
the
whole
of
the
population
of
the
parishes
down
this
vale
amounts
to
only
souls
according
to
the
official
return
to
parliament
and
mind
i
include
the
parish
of
fisherton
anger
a
suburb
of
the
city
of
salisbury
which
contains
of
the
number
i
include
the
town
of
heytesbury
with
its
souls
and
i
further
include
this
very
good
and
large
market
town
of
warminster
with
its
population
of
so
that
i
leave
in
the
other
parishes
only
souls
men
women
and
children
that
is
to
say
a
hundred
and
souls
to
each
parish
or
reckoning
five
to
a
family
families
to
each
parish
above
one
half
of
the
population
never
could
be
expected
to
be
in
the
church
at
one
time
so
that
here
are
churches
built
for
the
purpose
of
holding
two
thousand
and
eighty
people
there
are
several
of
these
churches
any
one
of
which
would
conveniently
contain
the
whole
of
these
people
the
two
thousand
and
eighty
the
church
of
bishopstrow
would
contain
the
whole
of
the
two
thousand
and
eighty
very
well
indeed
and
it
is
curious
enough
to
observe
that
the
churches
of
fisherton
anger
heytesbury
and
warminster
though
quite
sufficient
to
contain
the
people
that
go
to
church
are
none
of
them
nearly
so
big
as
several
of
the
village
churches
all
these
churches
are
built
long
and
long
before
the
reign
of
richard
the
second
that
is
to
say
they
were
founded
long
before
that
time
and
if
the
first
churches
were
gone
these
others
were
built
in
their
stead
there
is
hardly
one
of
them
that
is
not
as
old
as
the
reign
of
richard
the
second
and
yet
that
impudent
scotchman
george
chalmers
would
make
us
believe
that
in
the
reign
of
richard
the
second
the
population
of
the
country
was
hardly
anything
at
all
he
has
the
impudence
or
the
gross
ignorance
to
state
the
population
of
england
and
wales
at
which
as
i
have
shown
in
the
last
number
of
the
protestant
reformation
would
allow
only
twelve
able
men
to
every
parish
church
throughout
the
kingdom
what
i
ask
for
about
the
thousandth
time
i
ask
it
what
were
these
twenty
churches
built
for
some
of
them
stand
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
each
other
they
are
pretty
nearly
as
close
to
each
other
as
the
churches
in
london
and
westminster
are
what
a
monstrous
thing
to
suppose
that
they
were
built
without
there
being
people
to
go
to
them
and
built
too
without
money
and
without
hands
the
whole
of
the
population
in
these
parishes
could
stand
and
without
much
crowding
too
in
the
bottoms
of
the
towers
of
the
several
churches
nay
in
three
or
four
of
the
parishes
the
whole
of
the
people
could
stand
in
the
church
porches
then
the
show
you
how
numerous
the
population
must
have
been
you
see
in
some
cases
only
here
and
there
the
mark
of
a
grave
where
the
contains
from
half
an
acre
to
an
acre
of
land
and
sometimes
more
in
short
everything
shows
that
here
was
once
a
great
and
opulent
population
that
there
was
an
abundance
to
eat
to
wear
and
to
spare
that
all
the
land
that
is
now
under
cultivation
and
a
great
deal
that
is
not
now
under
cultivation
was
under
cultivation
in
former
times
the
scotch
beggars
would
make
us
believe
that
sprang
from
beggars
the
impudent
scribes
would
make
us
believe
that
england
was
formerly
nothing
at
all
till
they
came
to
enlighten
it
and
fatten
upon
it
let
the
beggars
answer
me
this
question
let
the
impudent
the
brazen
scribes
that
impose
upon
the
credulous
and
english
let
them
tell
me
these
churches
were
built
what
they
were
built
for
why
the
large
churches
of
the
two
codfords
were
stuck
up
within
a
few
hundred
yards
of
each
other
if
the
whole
of
the
population
could
then
as
it
can
now
be
crammed
into
the
chancel
of
either
of
the
two
churches
let
them
answer
me
this
question
or
shut
up
their
mouths
upon
this
subject
on
which
they
have
told
so
many
lies
as
to
the
produce
of
this
valley
it
must
be
at
least
ten
times
as
great
as
its
consumption
even
if
we
include
the
three
towns
that
belong
to
it
i
am
sure
i
saw
produce
enough
in
five
or
six
of
the
or
to
feed
the
whole
of
the
population
of
the
parishes
but
the
infernal
system
causes
it
all
to
be
carried
away
not
a
bit
of
good
beef
or
mutton
or
veal
and
scarcely
a
bit
of
bacon
is
left
for
those
who
raise
all
this
food
and
wool
the
labourers
here
as
if
they
were
they
answer
extremely
well
to
the
picture
that
fortescue
gave
of
the
french
in
his
day
talk
of
liberty
indeed
civil
and
religious
liberty
the
inquisition
with
a
belly
full
is
far
preferable
to
a
state
of
things
like
this
for
my
own
part
i
really
am
ashamed
to
ride
a
fat
horse
to
have
a
full
belly
and
to
have
a
clean
shirt
upon
my
back
while
i
look
at
these
wretched
countrymen
of
mine
while
i
actually
see
them
reeling
with
weakness
when
i
see
their
poor
faces
present
me
nothing
but
skin
and
bone
while
they
are
toiling
to
get
the
wheat
and
the
meat
ready
to
be
carried
away
to
be
devoured
by
the
i
am
ashamed
to
look
at
these
poor
souls
and
to
reflect
that
they
are
my
countrymen
and
particularly
to
reflect
that
we
are
descended
from
those
amongst
whom
beef
pork
mutton
and
veal
were
the
food
of
the
poorer
sort
of
people
what
and
is
the
emigration
committee
sitting
to
invent
the
means
of
getting
rid
of
some
part
of
the
families
that
are
employed
in
raising
the
immense
quantities
of
food
in
each
of
these
parishes
are
there
to
go
before
this
conjuration
committee
wiltshire
to
tell
the
committee
how
they
can
get
rid
of
a
part
of
these
one
hundred
and
persons
to
every
parish
are
there
schemers
of
this
sort
of
work
still
while
no
man
no
man
at
all
not
a
single
man
says
a
word
about
getting
rid
of
the
or
the
supernumerary
parsons
both
of
whom
have
actually
a
premium
given
them
for
breeding
and
are
filling
the
country
with
idlers
we
are
reversing
the
maxim
of
the
scripture
our
laws
almost
say
that
those
that
work
shall
not
eat
and
that
those
who
do
not
work
shall
have
the
food
i
repeat
that
the
baseness
of
the
english
surpasses
that
of
any
other
men
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
the
cowards
know
well
that
the
labourers
that
give
value
to
their
land
are
skin
and
bone
they
are
not
such
brutes
as
not
to
know
that
this
starvation
is
produced
by
taxation
they
know
well
how
unjust
it
is
to
treat
their
labourers
in
this
way
they
know
well
that
there
goes
down
the
common
foot
soldier
single
throat
more
food
than
is
allowed
by
them
to
a
labourer
his
wife
and
three
children
they
know
well
that
the
present
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
consumes
more
food
and
raiment
than
a
million
of
the
labourers
consume
aye
than
two
millions
of
them
consume
if
you
include
the
women
and
the
children
they
well
know
these
things
they
know
that
their
poor
labourers
are
taxed
to
keep
this
army
in
fatness
and
in
splendour
they
know
that
the
which
in
the
opinion
of
most
men
of
sense
ought
not
to
receive
a
single
farthing
of
the
public
money
swallow
more
of
good
food
than
a
third
or
a
fourth
part
of
the
real
labourers
of
england
swallow
they
know
that
a
million
and
a
half
of
pounds
sterling
was
taken
out
of
the
taxes
partly
raised
upon
the
labourers
to
enable
the
poor
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
to
marry
and
to
breed
they
know
that
a
regulation
has
been
recently
adopted
by
which
an
old
man
is
enabled
to
sell
his
to
a
young
man
and
that
thus
this
burden
would
if
the
system
were
to
be
continued
be
rendered
perpetual
they
know
that
a
good
slice
of
the
money
goes
and
that
even
these
hanoverians
can
sell
their
claim
upon
us
the
country
gentlemen
fellows
know
all
this
they
know
that
the
poor
labourers
including
all
the
poor
manufacturers
pay
of
their
wages
in
taxes
to
support
all
these
things
and
yet
not
a
word
about
these
things
is
ever
said
or
even
hinted
by
these
mean
these
cruel
these
cowardly
these
carrion
these
dastardly
reptiles
sir
james
graham
of
netherby
who
i
understand
is
a
young
fellow
instead
of
an
old
one
may
invoke
our
pity
upon
these
ancient
families
but
he
will
invoke
in
vain
it
was
their
duty
to
stand
forward
and
prevent
bills
six
acts
ellenborough
act
poaching
transportation
act
new
trespass
act
sunday
tolls
and
the
hundreds
of
other
things
that
could
be
named
on
the
contrary
were
the
cause
of
them
they
were
the
cause
of
all
the
taxes
and
all
the
debts
and
now
let
them
take
the
consequences
september
after
i
got
to
warminster
yesterday
it
began
to
rain
which
stopped
me
in
my
way
to
frome
in
somersetshire
which
lies
about
seven
or
eight
miles
from
this
place
but
as
i
meant
to
be
quite
in
the
northern
part
of
the
county
by
noon
or
i
took
a
in
the
afternoon
of
yesterday
and
went
to
frome
where
i
saw
upon
my
entrance
into
the
town
between
two
and
three
hundred
weavers
men
and
boys
cracking
stones
moving
earth
and
doing
other
sorts
of
work
towards
making
a
fine
road
into
the
town
i
drove
into
the
town
and
through
the
principal
streets
and
then
i
put
my
chaise
up
a
little
at
one
of
the
inns
this
appears
to
be
a
sort
of
little
manchester
a
very
small
manchester
indeed
for
it
does
not
contain
above
ten
or
twelve
thousand
people
but
it
has
all
the
of
a
manchester
and
the
innkeepers
and
their
people
look
and
behave
like
the
manchester
fellows
i
was
i
must
confess
glad
to
find
proofs
of
the
irretrievable
decay
of
the
place
i
remembered
how
ready
the
bluff
manufacturers
had
been
to
in
the
of
various
descriptions
let
them
said
i
to
myself
call
the
troops
in
now
to
make
their
trade
revive
let
them
now
resort
to
their
friends
of
the
yeomanry
and
of
the
army
let
them
now
threaten
their
poor
workmen
with
the
gaol
when
they
dare
to
ask
for
the
means
of
preventing
starvation
in
their
families
let
them
who
have
in
fact
lived
and
thriven
by
the
sword
now
call
upon
the
to
bring
out
the
soldiers
to
compel
me
for
instance
to
give
thirty
shillings
a
yard
for
the
superfine
black
broad
cloth
made
at
frome
which
roe
at
kensington
offered
me
at
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
a
yard
just
before
i
left
home
yes
these
men
have
ground
down
into
powder
those
who
were
earning
them
their
fortunes
let
the
grinders
themselves
now
be
ground
and
according
to
the
usual
wise
and
just
course
of
providence
let
them
be
crushed
by
the
system
which
they
have
delighted
in
because
it
made
others
crouch
beneath
them
their
poor
can
not
be
worse
off
than
they
long
have
been
the
parish
pay
which
they
now
get
upon
the
roads
is
a
week
for
a
man
for
his
wife
for
each
child
under
eight
years
of
age
a
week
in
addition
to
each
child
above
eight
who
can
go
to
work
and
if
the
children
above
eight
years
old
whether
girls
or
boys
do
not
go
to
work
upon
the
road
they
have
thus
a
family
of
five
people
have
just
as
much
and
eight
pence
over
as
goes
down
the
throat
of
one
single
foot
soldier
but
observe
the
standing
soldier
that
truly
english
institution
has
clothing
fuel
candle
soap
and
over
and
above
what
is
allowed
to
this
miserable
family
and
yet
the
base
reptiles
who
are
called
country
gentlemen
and
whom
sir
james
graham
calls
upon
us
to
commit
all
sorts
of
acts
of
injustice
in
order
to
never
utter
a
whisper
about
the
expenses
of
keeping
the
soldiers
while
they
are
everlastingly
railing
against
the
working
people
of
every
description
and
representing
them
and
them
only
as
the
cause
of
the
loss
of
their
estates
these
poor
creatures
at
frome
have
pawned
all
their
things
or
nearly
all
all
their
best
clothes
their
blankets
and
sheets
their
looms
any
little
piece
of
furniture
that
they
had
and
that
was
good
for
anything
mothers
have
been
compelled
to
pawn
all
the
tolerably
good
clothes
that
their
children
had
in
case
of
a
man
having
two
or
three
shirts
he
is
left
with
only
one
and
sometimes
without
any
shirt
and
though
this
is
a
sort
of
manufacture
that
can
not
very
well
come
to
a
complete
end
still
it
has
received
a
blow
from
which
it
can
not
possibly
recover
the
population
of
this
frome
has
been
augmented
to
the
degree
of
within
the
last
six
or
seven
years
there
are
here
all
the
usual
signs
of
accommodation
bills
and
all
false
paper
stuff
called
money
new
houses
in
abundance
half
finished
new
gingerbread
places
of
worship
as
they
are
called
great
swaggering
inns
parcels
of
swaggering
fellows
going
about
with
vulgarity
imprinted
upon
their
countenances
but
with
good
clothes
upon
their
backs
i
found
the
working
people
at
frome
very
intelligent
very
well
informed
as
to
the
cause
of
their
misery
not
at
all
humbugged
by
the
canters
whether
about
religion
or
loyalty
when
i
got
to
the
inn
i
sent
my
boy
back
to
the
road
to
tell
one
or
two
of
the
weavers
to
come
to
me
at
the
inn
the
landlord
did
not
at
first
like
to
let
such
ragged
fellows
upstairs
i
insisted
however
upon
their
coming
up
and
i
had
a
long
talk
with
them
they
were
very
intelligent
men
had
much
clearer
views
of
what
is
likely
to
happen
than
the
pretty
gentlemen
of
whitehall
seem
to
have
and
it
is
curious
enough
that
they
these
common
weavers
should
tell
me
that
they
thought
that
the
trade
never
would
come
back
again
to
what
it
was
before
or
rather
to
what
it
has
been
for
some
years
past
this
is
the
impression
everywhere
that
the
is
that
we
must
come
back
again
to
something
like
reality
the
first
factories
that
i
met
with
were
at
a
village
called
upton
lovell
just
before
i
came
to
heytesbury
there
they
were
not
more
than
a
quarter
work
there
is
only
one
factory
i
believe
here
at
warminster
and
that
has
been
suspended
during
the
harvest
at
any
rate
at
frome
they
are
all
upon
about
a
quarter
work
it
is
the
same
at
bradford
and
trowbridge
and
as
curious
a
thing
as
ever
was
heard
of
in
the
world
is
that
here
are
through
all
these
towns
and
throughout
this
country
weavers
from
the
north
singing
about
the
towns
ballads
of
distress
they
had
been
doing
it
at
salisbury
just
before
i
was
there
the
landlord
at
heytesbury
told
me
that
people
that
could
afford
it
generally
gave
them
something
and
i
was
told
that
they
did
the
same
at
salisbury
the
landlord
at
heytesbury
told
me
that
every
one
of
them
had
a
to
given
them
he
said
by
the
government
i
suppose
it
was
some
from
a
magistrate
though
i
know
of
no
law
that
allows
of
such
passes
and
a
pretty
thing
it
would
be
to
grant
such
licenses
or
such
passes
when
the
law
so
positively
commands
that
the
poor
of
every
parish
shall
be
maintained
in
and
by
every
such
parish
however
all
law
of
this
sort
all
salutary
and
humane
law
really
seems
to
be
drawing
towards
an
end
in
this
now
miserable
country
where
the
thousands
are
caused
to
wallow
in
luxury
to
be
surfeited
with
food
and
drink
while
the
millions
are
continually
on
the
point
of
famishing
in
order
to
form
an
idea
of
the
degradation
of
the
people
of
this
country
and
of
the
abandonment
of
every
english
principle
what
need
we
of
more
than
this
one
disgraceful
and
truly
horrible
fact
namely
that
common
soldiers
of
the
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
subscribe
in
order
to
furnish
the
meanest
of
diet
to
keep
from
starving
the
industrious
people
who
are
taxed
to
the
amount
of
of
their
wages
and
out
of
which
taxes
the
very
pay
of
these
soldiers
is
not
this
one
fact
this
disgraceful
this
damning
fact
is
not
this
enough
to
convince
us
that
must
be
a
that
there
must
be
a
complete
and
radical
change
or
that
england
must
become
a
country
of
the
basest
slavery
that
ever
disgraced
the
earth
wilts
sunday
morning
i
left
warminster
yesterday
at
about
one
it
is
contrary
to
my
practice
to
set
out
at
all
unless
i
can
do
it
early
in
the
morning
but
at
warminster
i
was
at
the
corner
of
this
county
and
i
had
made
a
sort
of
promise
to
be
at
highworth
which
is
at
the
corner
and
which
parish
indeed
joins
up
to
berkshire
the
distance
including
my
little
intended
deviations
was
more
than
fifty
miles
and
not
liking
to
attempt
it
in
one
day
i
set
off
in
the
middle
of
the
day
and
got
here
in
the
evening
just
before
a
pretty
heavy
rain
came
on
before
i
speak
of
my
ride
from
warminster
to
this
place
i
must
once
more
observe
that
warminster
is
a
very
nice
town
everything
belonging
to
it
is
and
there
are
no
villanous
gingerbread
houses
running
up
and
no
nasty
people
no
women
trapesing
about
with
showy
gowns
and
dirty
necks
no
fellows
with
dandy
coats
dirty
shirts
and
to
their
shoes
a
really
nice
and
good
town
it
is
a
great
one
of
the
greatest
in
this
part
of
england
and
here
things
are
still
conducted
in
the
good
old
honest
fashion
the
corn
is
brought
and
pitched
in
the
market
before
it
is
sold
and
when
sold
it
is
paid
for
on
the
nail
and
all
is
over
and
the
farmers
and
millers
gone
home
by
almost
everywhere
else
the
corn
is
sold
by
sample
it
is
sold
by
juggling
in
a
corner
the
parties
meet
and
drink
first
it
is
night
work
there
is
no
fair
and
open
market
the
mass
of
the
people
do
not
know
what
the
prices
are
and
all
this
favours
that
which
makes
the
corn
change
hands
many
times
perhaps
before
it
reaches
the
mouth
leaving
a
profit
in
each
pair
of
hands
and
which
monopoly
is
for
the
greater
part
carried
on
by
the
villanous
tribe
of
of
whom
ever
and
all
of
whom
prey
upon
the
rest
of
the
community
as
those
infernal
devils
the
wasps
prey
upon
the
bees
talking
of
the
devil
puts
one
in
mind
of
his
imps
and
talking
of
puts
one
in
mind
of
jemmy
cropper
of
liverpool
i
should
like
to
know
precisely
i
know
pretty
nearly
what
effect
late
panic
has
had
and
is
having
on
jemmy
perhaps
the
reader
will
recollect
that
jemmy
told
the
public
through
the
columns
of
base
bott
smith
that
cobbett
prophecies
were
falsified
as
soon
as
spawned
jemmy
canting
jemmy
has
now
had
time
to
ruminate
on
that
but
does
the
reader
remember
james
project
for
making
ireland
as
happy
as
england
it
was
simply
by
introducing
and
that
was
all
and
there
was
jemmy
in
ireland
before
such
lords
and
such
bishops
and
such
as
god
never
suffered
to
exist
in
the
world
before
there
was
jemmy
showing
proving
demonstrating
that
to
make
the
irish
would
infallibly
make
them
if
it
had
been
now
instead
of
being
two
years
ago
he
might
have
produced
the
reports
of
the
of
manchester
to
confirm
his
opinions
one
would
think
that
this
instance
of
the
folly
and
impudence
of
this
canting
son
of
the
monopolizing
sect
would
cure
this
public
of
its
proneness
to
listen
to
cant
but
nothing
will
cure
it
the
very
existence
of
this
sect
none
of
whom
ever
work
and
the
whole
of
whom
live
like
upon
the
labour
of
the
rest
of
the
community
the
very
of
such
a
sect
shows
that
the
nation
is
almost
in
its
nature
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
railing
against
the
king
of
spain
not
to
becall
the
king
of
spain
is
looked
upon
as
a
proof
of
want
of
liberality
and
what
must
it
be
then
to
any
of
the
acts
of
the
king
of
spain
this
i
am
about
to
do
however
think
black
of
it
what
he
may
in
the
first
place
the
mass
of
the
people
of
spain
are
better
off
better
fed
better
clothed
than
the
people
of
any
other
country
in
europe
and
much
better
than
the
people
of
england
are
that
is
one
thing
and
that
is
almost
enough
of
itself
in
the
next
place
the
king
of
spain
has
refused
to
mortgage
the
land
and
labour
of
his
people
for
the
benefit
of
an
infamous
set
of
jews
and
jobbers
next
the
king
of
spain
has
most
essentially
thwarted
the
people
the
manchester
of
august
the
parson
hay
the
sidmouth
circular
the
dungeoning
the
ogden
rupture
people
he
has
thwarted
and
most
cuttingly
annoyed
these
people
who
are
also
the
people
and
the
new
trespass
law
and
the
and
the
or
gendarmerie
and
the
people
the
king
of
spain
has
thwarted
all
these
and
he
has
materially
assisted
in
blowing
up
the
brutal
big
fellows
of
manchester
and
therefore
i
applaud
the
king
of
spain
i
do
not
much
like
weasels
but
i
hate
rats
and
therefore
i
say
success
to
the
weasels
but
there
is
one
act
of
the
king
of
spain
which
is
worthy
of
the
imitation
of
every
king
aye
and
of
every
republic
too
his
edict
for
taxing
traffickers
which
edict
was
published
about
eight
months
ago
it
imposes
a
pretty
heavy
annual
tax
on
every
one
who
is
a
buyer
and
and
who
neither
produces
nor
consumes
nor
makes
nor
changes
the
state
of
the
article
or
articles
that
he
buys
and
sells
those
who
bring
things
into
the
kingdom
are
deemed
producers
and
those
who
send
things
out
of
the
kingdom
are
deemed
changers
of
the
state
of
things
these
two
classes
embrace
all
thus
then
the
farmer
who
produces
corn
and
meat
and
wool
and
wood
is
not
taxed
nor
is
the
who
buys
the
corn
to
give
to
his
horses
nor
the
miller
who
buys
it
to
change
the
state
of
it
nor
the
baker
who
buys
the
flour
to
change
its
state
nor
is
the
manufacturer
who
buys
the
wool
to
change
its
state
and
so
on
but
the
jew
or
quaker
the
who
buys
the
corn
of
the
producer
to
sell
it
to
the
miller
and
to
deduct
which
must
at
last
fall
upon
the
consumer
this
jew
or
quaker
or
christian
who
acts
the
part
of
jew
or
quaker
is
taxed
by
the
king
of
spain
and
for
this
i
applaud
the
king
of
spain
if
we
had
a
law
like
this
the
pestiferous
sect
of
sleek
and
fat
hypocrites
could
not
exist
in
england
but
ours
is
altogether
system
of
created
by
taxation
and
from
which
monopolies
are
inseparable
it
is
notorious
that
the
monopoly
is
the
master
even
of
the
government
it
is
well
known
to
all
who
examine
and
reflect
that
a
very
large
part
of
our
bread
comes
to
our
mouths
loaded
with
the
profit
of
nine
or
ten
or
more
different
dealers
and
i
shall
as
soon
as
i
have
leisure
prove
as
clearly
as
anything
ever
was
proved
that
the
people
pay
two
millions
of
pounds
a
year
in
consequence
of
the
monopoly
in
tea
that
is
to
say
they
pay
two
millions
a
year
more
than
they
would
pay
were
it
not
for
the
monopoly
and
mind
i
do
not
mean
the
monopoly
of
the
east
india
company
but
the
monopoly
of
the
quaker
and
other
tea
dealers
who
buy
the
tea
of
that
company
the
people
of
this
country
are
eaten
up
by
monopolies
these
compel
those
who
labour
to
maintain
those
who
do
not
labour
and
hence
the
success
of
the
crafty
crew
of
quakers
the
very
of
which
sect
is
a
disgrace
to
the
country
besides
the
corn
market
at
warminster
i
was
delighted
and
greatly
surprised
to
see
the
not
only
the
very
finest
veal
and
lamb
that
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
but
so
exceedingly
beautiful
that
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
i
am
a
great
connoisseur
in
joints
of
meat
a
great
judge
if
years
of
experience
can
give
sound
judgment
i
verily
believe
that
i
have
bought
and
have
roasted
more
whole
sirloins
of
beef
than
any
man
in
england
i
know
all
about
the
matter
a
very
great
visitor
of
newgate
market
in
short
though
a
little
eater
i
am
a
very
great
provider
it
is
a
fancy
i
like
the
subject
and
therefore
i
understand
it
and
with
all
this
knowledge
of
the
matter
i
say
i
never
saw
veal
and
lamb
half
so
fine
as
what
i
saw
at
warminster
the
town
is
famed
for
fine
meat
and
i
knew
it
and
therefore
i
went
out
in
the
morning
to
look
at
the
meat
it
was
too
a
pound
cheaper
than
i
left
it
at
kensington
my
road
from
warminster
to
devizes
lay
through
westbury
a
nasty
odious
a
really
rotten
place
it
has
cloth
factories
in
it
and
they
seem
to
be
ready
to
tumble
down
as
well
as
many
of
the
houses
god
curse
seems
to
be
upon
most
of
these
after
coming
through
this
miserable
hole
i
came
along
on
the
north
side
of
the
famous
hill
called
bratton
castle
so
renowned
in
the
annals
of
the
romans
and
of
alfred
the
great
westbury
is
a
place
of
great
ancient
grandeur
and
it
is
easy
to
perceive
that
it
was
once
ten
or
twenty
times
its
present
size
my
road
was
now
the
line
of
separation
between
what
they
call
south
wilts
and
north
wilts
the
former
consisting
of
high
and
broad
downs
and
narrow
valleys
with
meadows
and
rivers
running
down
them
the
latter
consisting
of
a
rather
flat
enclosed
country
the
former
having
a
chalk
bottom
the
latter
a
bottom
of
marl
clay
or
flat
stone
the
former
a
country
for
lean
sheep
and
corn
and
the
latter
a
country
for
cattle
fat
sheep
cheese
and
bacon
the
former
by
far
to
my
taste
the
most
beautiful
and
i
am
by
no
means
sure
that
it
is
not
all
things
considered
the
most
rich
all
my
way
along
till
i
came
very
near
to
devizes
i
had
the
steep
and
naked
downs
up
to
my
right
and
the
flat
and
enclosed
country
to
my
left
very
near
to
bratton
castle
which
is
only
a
hill
with
deep
ditches
on
it
is
the
village
of
eddington
so
famed
for
the
battle
fought
here
by
alfred
and
the
danes
the
church
in
this
village
would
contain
several
thousands
of
persons
and
the
village
is
reduced
to
a
few
straggling
houses
the
land
here
is
very
good
better
than
almost
any
i
ever
saw
as
black
and
apparently
as
rich
as
the
land
in
the
at
fulham
the
turnips
are
very
good
all
along
here
for
several
miles
but
this
is
indeed
singularly
fine
and
rich
land
the
orchards
very
fine
finely
sheltered
and
the
crops
of
apples
and
pears
and
walnuts
very
abundant
walnuts
a
month
earlier
than
usual
after
eddington
i
came
to
a
hamlet
called
earl
stoke
the
houses
of
which
stand
at
a
few
yards
from
each
other
on
the
two
sides
of
the
road
every
house
is
white
and
the
front
of
every
one
is
covered
with
some
sort
or
other
of
clematis
or
with
or
jasmines
it
was
easy
to
guess
that
the
whole
belonged
to
one
owner
and
that
owner
i
found
to
be
a
watson
taylor
whose
very
pretty
seat
is
close
by
the
hamlet
and
in
whose
i
saw
what
i
never
saw
before
namely
some
they
are
not
nearly
so
large
as
the
white
nor
are
they
so
stately
in
their
movements
they
are
a
meaner
bird
wilts
monday
i
got
here
yesterday
after
a
ride
including
my
deviations
of
about
miles
and
that
too
breaking
my
before
i
got
into
the
of
calne
i
had
two
to
pay
to
the
aristocracy
namely
two
and
i
was
resolved
that
the
country
in
which
these
tolls
were
extorted
should
have
not
a
farthing
of
my
money
that
i
could
by
any
means
keep
from
it
therefore
i
fasted
until
i
got
into
the
in
which
i
now
am
i
would
have
made
my
horse
fast
too
if
i
could
have
done
it
without
the
risk
of
making
him
unable
to
carry
me
ride
from
highworth
to
cricklade
and
thence
to
malmsbury
wilts
monday
when
i
got
to
devizes
on
saturday
evening
and
came
to
look
out
of
the
into
the
street
i
perceived
that
i
had
seen
that
place
before
and
always
having
thought
that
i
should
like
to
devizes
of
which
i
had
heard
so
much
talk
as
a
famous
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
find
that
it
was
not
new
to
me
presently
a
came
up
to
the
door
with
bath
and
london
upon
its
panels
and
then
i
recollected
that
i
had
been
at
this
place
on
my
way
to
bristol
last
year
devizes
is
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
centre
of
the
county
and
the
that
passes
close
by
it
is
the
great
channel
through
which
the
produce
of
the
country
is
carried
away
to
be
devoured
by
the
idlers
the
thieves
and
the
prostitutes
who
are
all
in
the
wens
of
bath
and
london
pottern
which
i
passed
through
in
my
way
from
warminster
to
devizes
was
once
a
place
much
larger
than
devizes
and
it
is
now
a
mere
ragged
village
with
a
church
large
very
ancient
and
of
most
costly
structure
the
whole
of
the
people
here
might
as
in
most
other
cases
be
placed
in
the
or
the
all
the
way
along
the
are
nearly
all
gone
there
is
now
and
then
a
great
place
belonging
to
a
or
some
one
connected
with
but
all
the
are
gone
and
hence
it
is
that
parsons
are
now
made
justices
of
the
peace
there
are
few
other
persons
left
who
are
at
all
capable
of
filling
the
office
in
a
way
to
suit
the
system
the
monopolizing
brewers
and
are
in
some
places
the
magistrates
and
thus
is
the
whole
thing
and
england
is
no
more
what
it
was
very
near
to
the
sides
of
my
road
from
warminster
to
devizes
there
were
formerly
within
a
hundred
years
of
sufficient
note
to
be
marked
as
such
in
the
then
made
there
are
now
only
seven
of
them
remaining
there
were
five
nearly
close
to
my
road
and
in
one
parish
out
of
the
five
the
is
in
the
parliamentary
return
said
to
be
too
small
for
the
parson
to
live
in
though
the
church
would
contain
two
or
three
thousand
people
and
though
the
living
is
a
rectory
and
a
rich
one
too
thus
has
the
or
rather
that
public
property
which
is
called
church
property
been
dilapidated
the
parsons
have
swallowed
the
and
the
rent
of
the
glebes
and
have
successively
suffered
the
to
fall
into
decay
but
these
were
indeed
not
intended
for
large
families
they
were
intended
for
a
priest
a
main
part
of
whose
business
it
was
to
distribute
the
tithes
amongst
the
poor
and
the
strangers
the
parson
in
this
case
at
corsley
says
too
small
for
an
incumbent
with
a
family
ah
there
is
the
mischief
it
was
never
intended
to
give
men
tithes
as
a
premium
for
breeding
malthus
does
not
seem
to
see
any
harm
in
sort
of
increase
of
population
it
is
the
population
those
who
raise
the
food
and
the
clothing
that
he
and
scarlett
want
to
put
a
stop
to
the
breeding
of
i
saw
on
my
way
through
the
hundreds
of
acres
of
ploughed
land
in
what
i
mean
is
the
side
of
a
steep
hill
made
into
the
shape
of
only
the
rising
parts
more
sloping
than
those
of
a
stairs
and
deeper
in
proportion
the
side
of
the
hill
in
its
original
form
was
too
steep
to
be
ploughed
or
even
to
be
worked
with
a
spade
the
earth
as
soon
as
moved
would
have
rolled
down
the
hill
and
besides
the
rains
would
have
soon
washed
down
all
the
surface
earth
and
have
left
nothing
for
plants
of
any
sort
to
grow
in
therefore
the
sides
of
hills
where
the
land
was
sufficiently
good
and
where
it
was
wanted
for
the
growing
of
corn
were
thus
made
into
a
sort
of
steps
or
shelves
and
the
horizontal
parts
representing
the
parts
of
the
stairs
that
we
put
our
feet
upon
were
ploughed
and
sowed
as
they
generally
are
indeed
to
this
day
now
no
man
not
even
the
hireling
chalmers
will
have
the
impudence
to
say
that
these
shelves
amounting
to
thousands
and
thousands
of
acres
in
wiltshire
alone
were
not
made
by
the
hand
of
man
it
would
be
as
impudent
to
contend
that
the
churches
were
formed
by
the
flood
as
to
contend
that
these
shelves
were
formed
by
that
cause
yet
thus
the
scotch
scribes
must
contend
or
they
must
give
up
all
their
assertions
about
the
ancient
beggary
and
want
of
population
in
england
for
as
in
the
case
of
the
churches
what
were
these
shelves
made
and
could
they
be
made
at
all
without
a
great
abundance
of
hands
these
shelves
are
everywhere
to
be
seen
throughout
the
of
sussex
hampshire
wiltshire
dorsetshire
devonshire
and
cornwall
and
besides
this
large
tracts
of
land
amounting
to
millions
of
acres
perhaps
which
are
now
downs
heaths
or
woodlands
still
if
you
examine
closely
bear
the
marks
of
the
plough
the
fact
is
i
dare
say
that
the
country
has
never
varied
much
in
the
gross
amount
of
its
population
but
formerly
the
people
were
pretty
evenly
spread
over
the
country
instead
of
being
as
the
greater
part
of
them
now
are
collected
together
in
great
masses
where
for
the
greater
part
the
idlers
live
on
the
labour
of
the
industrious
in
quitting
devizes
yesterday
morning
i
saw
just
on
the
outside
of
the
town
a
monstrous
building
which
i
took
for
but
upon
asking
what
it
was
i
found
it
was
one
of
those
other
marks
of
the
jubilee
reign
namely
most
magnificent
it
seemed
to
me
sufficient
to
hold
of
the
men
in
the
county
and
it
would
do
it
too
and
do
it
well
such
a
system
must
come
to
an
end
and
the
end
must
be
dreadful
as
i
came
on
the
road
for
the
first
three
or
four
miles
i
saw
great
numbers
of
labourers
either
digging
potatoes
for
their
sunday
dinner
or
coming
home
with
them
or
going
out
to
dig
them
the
or
occupiers
let
small
pieces
of
land
to
the
labourers
and
these
they
cultivate
with
the
spade
for
their
own
use
they
pay
in
all
cases
a
high
rent
and
in
most
cases
an
enormous
one
the
practice
prevails
all
the
way
from
warminster
to
devizes
and
from
devizes
to
nearly
this
place
highworth
the
rent
is
in
some
places
a
shilling
a
rod
which
is
mind
or
an
acre
still
the
poor
creatures
like
to
have
the
land
they
work
in
it
at
their
spare
hours
and
on
sunday
mornings
early
and
the
overseers
sharp
as
they
may
be
can
not
ascertain
precisely
how
much
they
get
out
of
their
plat
of
ground
but
good
god
what
a
life
to
live
what
a
life
to
see
people
live
to
see
this
sight
in
our
own
country
and
to
have
the
base
vanity
to
of
that
country
and
to
talk
of
our
constitution
and
our
liberties
and
to
affect
to
the
spaniards
whose
working
people
live
like
gentlemen
compared
with
our
miserable
creatures
again
i
say
give
me
the
inquisition
and
cheeks
and
ribs
rather
than
civil
and
religious
liberty
and
skin
and
bone
but
the
fact
is
that
where
honest
and
laborious
men
can
be
compelled
to
starve
quietly
whether
all
at
once
or
by
inches
with
old
wheat
ricks
and
fat
cattle
under
their
eye
it
is
a
mockery
to
talk
of
their
liberty
of
any
sort
for
the
sum
total
of
their
state
is
this
they
have
liberty
to
choose
between
death
by
starvation
quick
or
slow
and
death
by
the
halter
between
warminster
and
westbury
i
saw
thirty
or
more
men
a
great
field
of
i
dare
say
twelve
acres
i
thought
surely
that
fellow
owen
is
not
got
at
work
here
that
owen
who
the
tell
us
went
to
the
continent
to
find
out
how
to
prevent
the
increase
of
the
labourers
children
no
it
was
not
owen
it
was
the
overseer
of
the
parish
who
had
set
these
men
to
dig
up
this
field
previously
to
its
being
sown
with
wheat
in
short
it
was
a
digging
instead
of
a
ploughing
the
men
i
found
upon
inquiry
got
a
day
for
their
work
plain
digging
in
the
market
gardens
near
london
is
i
believe
or
a
rod
if
these
poor
men
who
were
chiefly
weavers
or
spinners
from
westbury
or
had
come
home
to
their
parish
from
bradford
or
trowbridge
if
they
digged
six
rods
each
in
a
day
and
did
it
they
must
work
well
this
would
be
a
rod
or
an
acre
and
that
is
as
cheap
as
ploughing
and
four
times
as
good
but
how
much
better
to
give
the
men
higher
wages
and
let
them
do
more
work
if
married
how
are
their
miserable
families
to
live
on
a
week
and
if
single
they
must
and
will
have
more
either
by
poaching
or
by
taking
without
leave
at
any
rate
this
is
better
than
the
i
mean
better
for
those
who
pay
the
rates
for
here
is
something
which
they
get
for
the
money
that
they
give
to
the
poor
whereas
in
the
case
of
the
the
money
given
in
relief
is
generally
wholly
so
much
lost
to
the
what
a
curious
spectacle
this
is
the
manufactories
the
people
back
again
upon
the
it
is
not
above
eighteen
months
ago
that
the
scotch
feelosofers
and
especially
black
were
calling
upon
farm
labourers
to
become
i
remonstrated
with
the
doctor
at
the
time
but
he
still
insisted
that
such
a
transfer
of
hands
was
the
only
remedy
for
the
distress
in
the
farming
districts
however
and
i
thank
god
for
it
the
have
enough
to
do
at
now
for
the
poor
are
crying
for
food
in
dear
cleanly
warm
fruitful
scotland
herself
in
spite
of
a
the
hamiltons
and
a
the
wallaces
and
a
the
maxwells
and
a
the
hope
johnstones
and
a
the
dundases
and
the
edinbro
reviewers
and
a
the
broughams
and
birckbecks
in
spite
of
all
these
the
poor
of
scotland
are
now
helping
themselves
or
about
to
do
it
for
want
of
the
means
of
purchasing
food
from
devizes
i
came
to
the
vile
rotten
borough
of
calne
leaving
the
park
and
house
of
lord
lansdown
to
my
left
this
man
name
is
petty
and
doubtless
his
ancestors
came
in
with
the
conqueror
for
is
unquestionably
a
corruption
of
the
french
word
and
in
this
case
there
appears
to
have
been
not
the
least
degeneracy
a
thing
rather
rare
in
these
days
there
is
a
man
whose
name
was
grimstone
that
is
to
a
certainty
who
is
now
called
lord
verulam
and
who
according
to
his
pedigree
in
the
peerage
is
descended
from
a
of
the
conqueror
now
the
devil
a
bit
is
there
the
word
grindstone
or
grimstone
in
the
norman
language
well
let
them
have
all
that
their
french
descent
can
give
them
since
they
will
insist
upon
it
that
they
are
not
of
this
country
so
help
me
god
i
would
if
i
could
them
to
live
in
and
if
the
people
would
let
them
to
possess
this
petty
family
began
or
at
least
made
its
first
in
poor
unfortunate
ireland
the
of
that
push
would
amuse
the
people
of
wiltshire
talking
of
normans
and
puts
me
in
mind
of
beckford
and
his
abbey
the
public
knows
that
the
of
this
thing
fell
down
some
time
ago
it
was
built
of
and
cased
with
stone
in
it
there
was
a
place
which
the
owner
had
named
the
gallery
of
edward
the
frieze
of
which
says
the
account
contains
the
achievements
of
knights
of
the
garter
from
whom
the
owner
is
lineally
descended
was
there
ever
vanity
and
impudence
equal
to
these
the
brag
of
his
high
blood
i
dare
say
that
the
old
farquhar
had
as
good
pretension
and
i
really
should
like
to
know
whether
he
took
out
beckford
name
and
put
in
his
own
as
the
lineal
descendant
of
the
knights
of
the
garter
i
could
not
come
through
that
villanous
hole
calne
without
cursing
corruption
at
every
step
and
when
i
was
coming
by
an
place
called
the
i
suppose
i
poured
out
a
double
dose
of
execration
upon
it
out
of
the
into
the
fire
for
in
about
ten
miles
more
i
came
to
another
called
this
also
is
a
mean
vile
place
though
the
country
all
round
it
is
very
fine
on
this
side
of
i
went
out
of
my
way
to
see
the
church
at
great
lyddiard
which
in
the
parliamentary
return
is
called
lyddiard
in
my
old
map
it
is
called
and
to
a
certainty
the
word
was
that
is
to
say
or
here
is
a
good
old
and
large
garden
and
a
park
belonging
they
told
me
to
lord
bolingbroke
i
went
quite
down
to
the
house
close
to
which
stands
the
large
and
fine
church
it
appears
have
a
noble
place
the
land
is
some
of
the
finest
in
the
whole
country
the
trees
show
that
the
land
is
excellent
but
all
except
the
church
is
in
a
state
of
irrepair
and
apparent
neglect
if
not
abandonment
the
parish
is
large
the
living
is
a
rich
one
it
is
a
rectory
but
though
the
incumbent
has
the
great
and
small
tithes
he
in
his
return
tells
the
parliament
that
the
is
worn
out
and
incapable
of
repair
and
observe
that
parliament
lets
him
continue
to
sack
the
produce
of
the
tithes
and
the
glebe
while
they
know
the
to
be
and
while
he
has
the
impudence
to
tell
them
that
he
does
not
reside
in
it
though
the
law
says
that
he
shall
and
while
this
is
suffered
to
be
a
man
may
be
transported
for
being
in
pursuit
of
a
hare
what
coals
how
hot
how
red
is
this
flagitious
system
preparing
for
the
backs
of
its
supporters
in
coming
from
to
highworth
i
left
swindon
a
few
miles
away
to
my
left
and
came
by
the
village
of
blunsdon
all
along
here
i
saw
great
quantities
of
hops
in
the
hedges
and
very
fine
hops
and
i
saw
at
a
village
called
stratton
i
think
it
was
the
finest
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
the
main
stalk
was
more
than
four
feet
high
and
there
were
four
stalks
none
of
which
were
less
than
three
feet
high
all
through
the
country
poor
as
well
as
rich
are
very
neat
in
their
gardens
and
very
careful
to
raise
a
great
variety
of
flowers
at
blunsdon
i
saw
a
clump
or
rather
a
sort
of
orchard
of
as
fine
as
i
ever
beheld
and
loaded
with
walnuts
indeed
i
have
seen
great
crops
of
walnuts
all
the
way
from
london
from
blunsdon
to
this
place
is
but
a
short
distance
and
i
got
here
about
two
or
three
this
is
a
some
corn
but
generally
speaking
it
is
a
country
of
dairies
the
sheep
here
are
of
the
large
kind
a
sort
of
leicester
sheep
and
the
cattle
chiefly
for
milking
the
ground
is
a
stiff
loam
at
top
and
a
yellowish
stone
under
the
houses
are
almost
all
built
of
stone
it
is
a
tolerably
rich
but
by
no
means
a
gay
and
pretty
country
highworth
has
a
situation
corresponding
with
its
name
on
every
side
you
go
to
it
and
from
it
you
see
to
a
great
distance
all
round
and
into
many
counties
wednesday
the
great
object
of
my
visit
to
the
northern
border
of
wiltshire
will
be
mentioned
when
i
get
to
malmsbury
whither
i
intend
to
go
or
next
day
and
thence
through
gloucestershire
in
my
way
to
herefordshire
but
an
additional
inducement
was
to
have
a
good
long
political
with
some
excellent
friends
who
detest
the
as
cordially
as
i
do
and
who
i
hope
wish
as
anxiously
to
see
their
fall
effected
and
no
matter
by
what
means
there
was
however
arising
incidentally
a
third
object
which
had
i
known
of
its
existence
would
of
itself
have
brought
me
from
the
to
the
corner
of
this
county
one
of
the
parishes
adjoining
to
highworth
is
that
of
coleshill
which
is
in
berkshire
and
which
is
the
property
of
lord
radnor
or
lord
folkestone
and
is
the
seat
of
the
latter
i
was
at
coleshill
or
three
years
ago
and
twice
at
later
periods
in
lord
folkestone
bought
some
locust
trees
of
me
and
he
has
several
times
told
me
that
they
were
growing
very
finely
but
i
did
not
know
that
they
had
been
planted
at
coleshill
and
indeed
i
always
thought
that
they
had
been
planted
somewhere
in
the
south
of
wiltshire
i
now
found
however
that
they
were
growing
at
coleshill
and
yesterday
i
went
to
see
them
and
was
for
many
reasons
more
delighted
with
the
sight
than
with
any
that
i
have
beheld
for
a
long
while
these
trees
stand
in
clumps
of
trees
in
each
and
the
trees
being
four
feet
apart
each
way
these
clumps
make
part
of
a
plantation
of
or
forty
acres
perhaps
acres
the
rest
of
the
ground
that
is
to
say
the
ground
where
the
clumps
of
locusts
do
not
stand
was
at
the
same
time
that
the
locust
clumps
were
planted
with
chestnuts
elms
ashes
oaks
beeches
and
other
trees
these
trees
were
stouter
and
taller
than
the
locust
trees
were
when
the
plantation
was
made
yet
if
you
were
now
to
place
yourself
at
a
mile
distance
from
the
plantation
you
would
not
think
that
there
was
any
plantation
at
all
except
the
clumps
the
fact
is
that
the
other
trees
have
as
they
generally
do
made
as
yet
but
very
little
progress
are
not
i
should
think
upon
an
average
more
than
feet
or
feet
high
while
the
clumps
of
locusts
are
from
to
feet
high
and
i
think
that
i
may
safely
say
that
the
average
height
is
sixteen
feet
they
are
the
most
beautiful
clumps
of
trees
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
they
were
indeed
planted
by
a
clever
and
most
trusty
servant
who
to
say
all
that
can
be
said
in
his
praise
is
that
he
is
worthy
of
such
a
master
as
he
has
the
trees
are
indeed
in
good
land
and
have
been
taken
good
care
of
but
the
other
trees
are
in
the
same
land
and
while
they
have
been
taken
the
same
care
of
since
they
were
planted
they
had
not
i
am
sure
worse
treatment
before
planting
than
these
locust
trees
had
at
the
time
when
i
sold
them
to
my
lord
folkestone
they
were
in
a
field
at
worth
near
crawley
in
sussex
the
history
of
their
transport
is
this
a
wiltshire
wagon
came
to
worth
for
the
trees
on
the
of
march
the
wagon
had
been
stopped
on
the
way
by
the
snow
and
though
the
snow
was
gone
off
before
the
trees
were
put
upon
the
wagon
it
was
very
cold
and
there
were
sharp
frosts
and
harsh
winds
i
had
the
trees
taken
up
and
tied
up
in
hundreds
by
withes
like
so
many
fagots
they
were
then
put
in
and
upon
the
wagon
we
doing
our
best
to
keep
the
roots
inwards
in
the
loading
so
as
to
prevent
them
from
being
exposed
but
as
little
as
possible
to
the
wind
sun
and
frost
we
put
some
fern
on
the
top
and
where
we
could
on
the
sides
and
we
tied
on
the
load
with
ropes
just
as
we
should
have
done
with
a
load
of
fagots
in
this
way
they
were
several
days
upon
the
road
and
i
do
not
know
how
long
it
was
before
they
got
safe
into
the
ground
again
all
this
shows
how
hardy
these
trees
are
and
it
ought
to
admonish
gentlemen
to
make
pretty
strict
enquiries
when
they
have
gardeners
or
bailiffs
or
stewards
under
whose
hands
locust
trees
die
or
do
not
thrive
dry
as
the
late
summer
was
i
never
had
my
locust
trees
so
fine
as
they
are
this
year
i
have
some
they
write
me
five
feet
high
from
seed
sown
just
before
i
went
to
preston
the
first
time
that
is
to
say
on
the
of
may
i
shall
advertise
my
trees
in
the
next
register
i
never
had
them
so
fine
though
the
great
drought
has
made
the
number
comparatively
small
lord
folkestone
bought
of
me
trees
they
are
at
this
moment
worth
the
money
they
cost
him
and
in
addition
the
cost
of
planting
and
in
addition
to
that
they
are
worth
the
fee
simple
of
the
ground
very
good
ground
on
which
they
stand
and
this
i
am
able
to
demonstrate
to
any
man
in
his
senses
what
a
difference
in
the
value
of
wiltshire
if
all
its
elms
were
locusts
as
fuel
a
foot
of
is
worth
four
or
five
of
any
english
wood
it
will
burn
better
green
than
almost
any
other
wood
will
dry
if
men
want
woods
beautiful
woods
and
a
let
them
go
and
see
the
clumps
at
coleshill
think
of
a
wood
feet
high
and
i
may
say
feet
high
in
months
from
the
day
of
planting
and
the
plants
on
an
average
not
more
than
two
feet
high
when
planted
think
of
that
and
any
one
may
see
it
at
coleshill
see
what
efforts
gentlemen
make
get
a
how
they
look
at
the
poor
things
for
years
when
they
might
if
they
would
have
it
at
once
really
almost
at
a
wish
and
with
due
attention
in
almost
any
soil
and
the
most
valuable
of
woods
into
the
bargain
palmer
the
bailiff
showed
me
near
the
house
at
coleshill
a
locust
tree
which
was
planted
about
years
ago
or
perhaps
he
had
measured
it
before
it
is
eight
foot
and
an
inch
round
at
a
foot
from
the
ground
it
goes
off
afterwards
into
two
principal
limbs
which
two
soon
become
six
limbs
and
each
of
these
limbs
is
three
feet
round
so
that
here
are
six
everlasting
to
begin
with
this
tree
is
worth
pounds
at
the
least
farthing
i
saw
also
at
coleshill
the
most
complete
farmyard
that
i
ever
saw
and
that
i
believe
there
is
in
all
england
many
and
complete
as
english
farmyards
are
this
was
the
contrivance
of
palmer
lord
bailiff
and
steward
the
master
gives
all
the
credit
of
plantation
and
farm
to
the
servant
but
the
servant
ascribes
a
good
deal
of
it
to
the
master
between
them
at
any
rate
here
are
some
most
admirable
objects
in
rural
affairs
and
here
too
there
is
no
misery
amongst
those
who
do
the
work
those
without
whom
there
could
have
been
no
and
no
farmyard
here
all
are
comfortable
gaunt
hunger
here
stares
no
man
in
the
face
that
same
disposition
which
sent
lord
folkestone
to
visit
john
knight
in
the
dungeons
at
reading
keeps
pinching
hunger
away
from
coleshill
it
is
a
very
pretty
spot
all
taken
together
it
is
chiefly
grazing
land
and
though
the
making
of
cheese
and
bacon
is
i
dare
say
the
most
profitable
part
of
the
farming
here
lord
folkestone
fats
oxen
and
has
a
stall
for
it
which
ought
to
be
shown
to
foreigners
instead
of
the
spinning
jennies
a
fat
ox
is
a
finer
thing
than
a
cheese
however
good
there
is
a
dairy
here
too
and
beautifully
kept
when
this
stall
is
full
of
oxen
and
they
all
fat
how
it
would
make
a
french
farmer
stare
it
would
make
even
a
yankee
think
that
old
england
was
a
respectable
mother
after
all
if
i
had
to
show
this
village
off
to
a
yankee
i
would
blindfold
him
all
the
way
to
and
after
i
got
him
out
of
the
village
lest
he
should
see
the
of
paupers
on
the
road
for
a
week
or
ten
days
before
i
came
to
highworth
i
had
owing
to
the
uncertainty
as
to
where
i
should
be
had
no
newspapers
sent
me
from
london
so
that
really
i
began
to
feel
that
i
was
in
the
dark
ages
arrived
here
however
the
came
bursting
in
upon
me
flash
after
flash
from
the
wen
from
dublin
and
from
modern
athens
i
had
too
for
several
days
had
nobody
to
enjoy
the
light
with
i
had
no
sharers
in
the
treat
and
this
sort
of
enjoyment
unlike
that
of
some
other
sorts
is
augmented
by
being
divided
oh
how
happy
we
were
and
how
proud
we
were
to
find
from
the
instructor
that
we
had
a
king
that
we
were
the
subjects
of
a
sovereign
who
had
graciously
sent
pounds
to
sir
richard
birnie
there
to
swell
the
amount
of
the
munificence
of
fined
delinquents
aye
and
this
too
while
as
the
instructor
told
us
this
same
sovereign
had
just
bestowed
unasked
for
oh
the
dear
good
man
an
annuity
of
a
year
on
fox
who
observe
and
whose
daughters
had
already
a
banging
pension
paid
out
of
the
taxes
raised
in
part
and
in
the
greatest
part
upon
a
people
who
are
and
and
our
admiration
at
the
affair
was
not
at
all
lessened
by
the
reflection
that
more
money
than
sufficient
to
pay
all
the
of
wiltshire
and
berkshire
will
this
very
year
have
been
expended
on
new
palaces
on
pullings
down
and
alterations
of
palaces
before
existing
and
on
ornaments
and
decorations
in
and
about
hyde
park
where
a
bridge
is
building
which
i
am
told
must
cost
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
though
all
the
water
that
has
to
pass
under
it
would
go
through
a
and
does
a
little
while
before
it
comes
to
this
bridge
go
through
an
arch
which
i
believe
to
be
smaller
than
a
besides
there
was
a
bridge
here
before
and
a
very
good
one
too
now
will
jerry
curteis
who
complains
so
bitterly
about
the
and
who
talks
of
the
poor
working
people
as
if
their
poverty
were
the
worst
of
crimes
will
jerry
say
anything
about
this
bridge
or
about
the
enormous
expenses
at
hyde
park
corner
and
in
james
park
jerry
knows
or
he
ought
to
know
that
this
bridge
alone
will
cost
more
money
than
half
the
of
the
county
of
sussex
jerry
knows
or
he
ought
to
know
that
this
bridge
must
be
paid
for
out
of
the
taxes
he
must
know
or
else
he
must
be
what
i
dare
not
suppose
him
that
it
is
the
taxes
that
make
the
paupers
and
yet
i
am
afraid
that
jerry
will
not
open
his
lips
on
the
subject
of
this
bridge
what
they
are
going
at
at
hyde
park
corner
nobody
that
i
talk
with
seems
to
know
the
great
captain
of
the
age
as
that
nasty
palaverer
brougham
called
him
lives
close
to
this
spot
where
also
the
english
ladies
naked
achilles
stands
having
on
the
base
of
it
the
word
wellington
in
great
staring
letters
while
all
the
other
letters
are
very
very
small
so
that
base
and
from
the
country
when
they
go
to
crouch
before
this
image
think
it
is
the
image
of
the
great
captain
himself
the
reader
will
recollect
that
after
the
battle
of
waterloo
when
we
beat
napoleon
with
nearly
a
million
of
foreign
bayonets
in
our
pay
pay
that
came
out
of
that
for
which
we
have
to
wince
and
howl
the
reader
will
recollect
that
at
that
glorious
time
when
the
insolent
wretches
of
were
ready
to
trample
us
under
foot
that
at
that
time
when
the
yankees
were
defeated
on
the
serpentine
river
and
before
they
had
thrashed
blue
and
buff
so
unmercifully
on
the
ocean
and
on
the
lakes
that
at
that
time
when
the
creatures
called
english
ladies
were
flocking
from
all
parts
of
the
country
to
present
rings
to
old
blucher
that
at
that
time
of
exultation
with
the
corrupt
and
of
mourning
with
the
virtuous
the
collective
in
the
in
the
delirium
of
its
joy
resolved
to
expend
three
millions
of
money
on
triumphal
arches
or
columns
or
monuments
of
some
sort
or
other
to
commemorate
the
glories
of
the
war
soon
after
this
however
low
prices
came
and
they
drove
triumphal
arches
out
of
the
heads
of
the
ministers
until
prosperity
unparalleled
prosperity
came
this
set
them
to
work
upon
palaces
and
streets
and
i
am
told
that
the
project
is
now
going
on
at
hyde
park
corner
good
god
if
this
should
be
true
how
apt
will
everything
be
just
about
the
time
that
the
arch
or
arches
will
be
completed
just
about
the
time
that
the
scaffolding
will
be
knocked
away
down
will
come
the
whole
of
the
horrid
system
for
the
upholding
of
which
the
vile
crew
called
for
the
war
all
these
palaces
and
other
expensive
projects
were
hatched
two
years
ago
they
were
hatched
in
the
days
of
prosperity
the
plans
and
contracts
were
made
i
dare
say
two
or
three
years
ago
however
they
will
be
completed
much
about
in
the
nick
of
time
they
will
help
to
exhibit
the
system
in
its
true
light
the
best
possible
public
instructor
tells
us
that
canning
is
going
to
paris
for
what
i
wonder
his
brother
huskisson
was
there
last
year
and
he
did
nothing
it
is
supposed
that
the
revered
and
ruptured
ogden
orator
is
going
to
try
the
force
of
his
oratory
in
order
to
induce
france
and
her
allies
to
let
portugal
alone
he
would
do
better
to
arm
some
ships
of
war
oh
no
never
will
that
be
done
again
or
at
least
there
never
will
again
be
war
for
three
months
as
long
as
this
borough
and
paper
system
shall
last
this
system
has
run
itself
out
it
has
lasted
a
good
while
and
has
done
tremendous
mischief
to
the
people
of
england
but
it
is
over
it
is
done
for
it
will
live
for
a
while
but
it
will
go
about
drooping
its
wings
and
half
shutting
its
eyes
like
a
cock
that
has
got
the
pip
it
will
never
crow
again
and
for
that
i
most
humbly
and
fervently
thank
god
it
has
crowed
over
us
long
enough
it
has
pecked
us
and
spurred
us
and
slapped
us
about
quite
long
enough
the
nasty
insolent
creatures
that
it
has
sheltered
under
its
wings
have
triumphed
long
enough
they
are
now
going
to
the
workhouse
and
thither
let
them
go
i
nothing
of
the
politics
of
the
bourbons
but
though
i
can
easily
conceive
that
they
would
not
like
to
see
an
end
of
the
paper
system
and
a
consequent
reform
in
england
though
i
can
see
very
good
reasons
for
believing
this
i
do
not
believe
that
canning
will
induce
them
to
sacrifice
their
own
obvious
and
immediate
interests
for
the
sake
of
preserving
our
funding
system
he
will
not
get
them
out
of
cadiz
and
he
will
not
induce
them
to
desist
from
interfering
in
the
affairs
of
portugal
if
they
find
it
their
interest
to
interfere
they
know
that
we
go
to
they
know
this
as
well
as
we
do
and
every
sane
person
in
england
seems
to
know
it
well
no
war
for
us
we
are
come
to
this
at
last
no
war
with
and
this
debt
defies
every
power
but
that
of
foreign
nations
were
as
to
our
real
state
a
good
deal
enlightened
by
late
panic
they
had
hardly
any
notion
of
our
state
before
that
that
opened
their
eyes
and
led
them
to
conclusions
that
they
never
before
dreamed
of
it
made
them
see
that
that
which
they
had
always
taken
for
a
mountain
of
solid
gold
was
only
a
great
heap
of
rubbishy
rotten
paper
and
they
now
of
course
estimate
us
accordingly
but
it
signifies
not
what
think
or
what
do
unless
they
will
subscribe
and
pay
off
this
for
the
people
at
whitehall
the
foreign
governments
not
excepting
the
american
all
hate
the
english
reformers
those
of
europe
because
our
example
would
be
so
dangerous
to
despots
and
that
of
america
because
we
should
not
suffer
it
to
build
fleets
and
to
add
to
its
territories
at
pleasure
so
that
we
have
not
only
our
own
and
against
us
but
also
all
foreign
governments
not
a
straw
however
do
we
care
for
them
all
so
long
as
we
have
for
us
the
and
let
our
foes
subscribe
i
say
and
pay
off
that
for
until
they
do
that
we
snap
our
fingers
at
them
friday
the
best
public
instructor
of
yesterday
arrived
informs
us
that
a
number
of
official
gentlemen
connected
with
finance
have
waited
upon
lord
liverpool
connected
with
finance
and
a
number
of
them
too
bless
their
numerous
and
united
noddles
good
god
what
a
state
of
things
it
is
altogether
there
never
was
the
like
of
it
seen
in
this
world
before
certainly
never
and
the
end
must
be
what
the
far
greater
part
of
the
people
anticipate
it
was
this
very
lord
liverpool
that
ascribed
the
of
the
country
to
a
of
and
that
too
at
the
very
time
when
he
was
advising
the
king
to
put
forth
a
begging
proclamation
to
raise
money
to
prevent
or
rather
put
a
stop
to
starvation
in
ireland
and
when
at
the
same
time
public
money
was
granted
for
the
causing
of
english
people
to
emigrate
to
africa
ah
good
god
who
is
to
record
or
recount
the
endless
blessings
of
a
the
instructor
gives
us
a
sad
account
of
the
state
of
the
working
classes
in
scotland
i
am
not
glad
that
these
poor
people
suffer
i
am
very
sorry
for
it
and
if
i
could
relieve
them
out
of
my
own
means
without
doing
good
to
and
removing
danger
from
the
insolent
and
of
scotland
i
would
share
my
last
shilling
with
the
poor
fellows
but
i
must
be
glad
that
something
has
happened
to
silence
the
impudent
scotch
quacks
who
have
been
for
six
years
past
crying
up
the
doctrine
of
malthus
and
railing
against
the
english
let
us
now
see
what
will
do
with
their
poor
let
us
see
whether
they
will
have
the
impudence
to
call
upon
to
maintain
their
poor
well
amidst
all
this
suffering
there
is
one
good
thing
the
scotch
political
economy
is
blown
to
the
devil
and
the
edinburgh
review
and
adam
smith
along
with
it
wilts
monday
i
was
detained
at
highworth
partly
by
the
rain
and
partly
by
company
that
i
liked
very
much
i
left
it
at
six
yesterday
morning
and
got
to
this
town
about
three
or
four
in
the
afternoon
after
a
ride
including
my
deviations
of
miles
and
as
pleasant
a
ride
as
man
ever
had
i
got
to
a
farmhouse
in
the
neighbourhood
of
cricklade
to
breakfast
at
which
house
i
was
very
near
to
the
source
of
the
river
isis
which
is
they
say
the
first
branch
of
the
thames
they
call
it
the
old
thames
and
i
rode
through
it
here
it
not
being
above
four
or
five
yards
wide
and
not
deeper
than
the
knees
of
my
horse
the
land
here
and
all
round
cricklade
is
very
fine
here
are
some
of
the
very
finest
pastures
in
all
england
and
some
of
the
finest
dairies
of
cows
from
to
in
a
dairy
grazing
in
them
was
not
this
so
was
it
created
by
the
union
with
scotland
or
was
it
begotten
by
pitt
and
his
crew
aye
it
was
always
so
and
there
were
formerly
two
churches
here
where
there
is
now
only
one
and
five
six
or
ten
times
as
many
people
i
saw
in
one
single
farmyard
here
more
food
than
enough
for
four
times
the
inhabitants
of
the
parish
and
this
yard
did
not
contain
a
tenth
perhaps
of
the
produce
of
the
parish
but
while
the
poor
creatures
that
raise
the
wheat
and
the
barley
and
cheese
and
the
mutton
and
the
beef
are
living
upon
potatoes
an
accursed
comes
kindly
through
the
parish
to
convey
away
the
wheat
and
all
the
good
food
to
the
and
their
attendants
in
the
wen
what
then
is
this
an
improvement
is
a
nation
for
the
carrying
away
of
the
food
from
those
who
raise
it
and
giving
it
to
bayonet
men
and
others
who
are
assembled
in
great
masses
i
could
the
fellow
who
would
look
me
in
the
face
and
call
this
an
improvement
what
was
it
not
better
for
the
consumers
of
the
food
to
live
near
to
the
places
where
it
was
grown
we
have
very
nearly
come
to
the
system
of
hindostan
where
the
farmer
is
allowed
by
the
or
only
so
much
of
the
produce
of
his
farm
to
eat
in
the
year
the
thing
is
not
done
in
so
undisguised
a
manner
here
here
are
assessor
collector
exciseman
supervisor
informer
constable
justice
sheriff
jailor
judge
jury
here
is
a
great
deal
of
ceremony
about
it
all
is
done
according
to
law
it
is
the
country
in
the
world
but
somehow
or
other
the
produce
is
at
last
and
it
is
eaten
for
the
main
part
by
those
who
do
not
work
i
observed
some
pages
back
that
when
i
got
to
malmsbury
i
should
have
to
explain
my
main
object
in
coming
to
the
north
of
wiltshire
in
the
year
the
parliament
by
ordered
the
bishops
to
cause
the
beneficed
clergy
to
give
in
an
account
of
their
livings
which
account
was
to
contain
the
following
particulars
relating
to
each
parish
whether
a
rectory
vicarage
or
what
in
what
rural
deanery
population
number
of
churches
and
chapels
of
persons
the
churches
and
chapels
in
looking
into
this
account
as
it
was
finally
made
up
and
printed
by
the
parliamentary
officers
i
saw
that
it
was
impossible
for
it
to
be
true
i
have
always
asserted
and
indeed
i
have
clearly
proved
that
one
of
the
two
last
population
returns
is
false
barefacedly
false
and
i
was
sure
that
the
account
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
was
equally
false
the
falsehood
consisted
i
saw
principally
in
the
account
of
the
capacity
of
the
church
to
contain
people
that
is
under
the
head
no
as
above
stated
i
saw
that
in
almost
every
instance
this
account
must
of
necessity
be
false
though
coming
from
under
the
pen
of
a
beneficed
clergyman
i
saw
that
there
was
a
constant
desire
to
make
it
appear
that
the
church
was
now
become
too
small
and
thus
to
help
along
the
opinion
of
a
great
recent
increase
of
population
an
opinion
so
sedulously
inculcated
by
all
the
of
every
sort
and
by
the
most
brutal
and
best
public
instructor
in
some
cases
the
falsehood
of
this
account
was
impudent
almost
beyond
conception
and
yet
it
required
going
to
the
spot
to
get
unquestionable
proof
of
the
falsehood
in
many
of
the
parishes
in
hundreds
of
them
the
population
is
next
to
nothing
far
fewer
persons
than
the
church
porch
would
contain
even
in
these
cases
the
parsons
have
seldom
said
that
the
church
would
contain
more
than
the
population
in
such
cases
they
have
generally
said
that
the
church
can
contain
the
population
so
it
can
but
it
can
contain
ten
times
the
number
and
thus
it
was
that
in
words
of
truth
a
lie
in
meaning
was
told
to
the
parliament
and
not
one
word
of
notice
was
ever
taken
of
it
little
langford
or
landford
for
instance
between
salisbury
and
warminster
is
returned
as
having
a
population
under
twenty
and
a
church
that
can
contain
the
population
this
church
which
i
went
and
looked
at
can
contain
very
conveniently
two
hundred
people
but
there
was
one
instance
in
which
the
parson
had
been
singularly
impudent
for
he
had
stated
the
population
at
eight
persons
and
had
stated
that
the
church
could
contain
eight
persons
this
was
the
account
of
the
parish
of
sharncut
in
this
county
of
wilts
it
lies
on
the
very
northermost
edge
of
the
county
and
its
boundary
on
one
side
divides
wiltshire
from
gloucestershire
to
this
sharncut
therefore
i
was
resolved
to
go
and
to
try
the
fact
with
my
own
eyes
when
therefore
i
got
through
cricklade
i
was
compelled
to
quit
the
malmsbury
road
and
go
away
to
my
right
i
had
to
go
through
a
village
called
ashton
keines
with
which
place
i
was
very
much
stricken
it
is
now
a
straggling
village
but
to
a
certainty
it
has
been
a
large
market
town
there
is
a
still
standing
in
an
open
place
in
it
and
there
are
such
numerous
lanes
crossing
each
other
and
cutting
the
land
up
into
such
little
bits
that
it
must
at
one
time
have
been
a
large
town
it
is
a
very
curious
place
and
i
should
have
stopped
in
it
for
some
time
but
i
was
now
within
a
few
miles
of
the
famous
sharncut
the
church
of
which
according
to
the
parson
account
contain
eight
persons
at
the
end
of
about
three
miles
more
of
road
rather
difficult
to
find
but
very
pleasant
i
got
to
sharncut
which
i
found
to
consist
of
a
church
two
farmhouses
and
a
one
part
of
the
buildings
of
which
had
become
a
labourer
house
the
church
has
no
tower
but
a
sort
of
very
ancient
on
the
transept
the
church
is
sixty
feet
long
and
on
an
average
feet
wide
so
that
the
area
of
it
contains
one
thousand
six
hundred
and
eighty
square
feet
or
one
hundred
and
square
yards
i
found
in
the
church
eleven
pews
that
would
contain
that
were
made
to
contain
people
and
these
do
not
occupy
a
third
part
of
the
area
of
the
church
and
thus
more
than
two
hundred
persons
at
the
least
might
be
accommodated
with
perfect
convenience
in
this
church
which
the
parson
says
contain
nay
the
church
porch
on
its
two
benches
would
hold
twenty
people
taking
little
and
big
promiscuously
i
have
been
thus
particular
in
this
instance
because
i
would
leave
no
doubt
as
to
the
barefacedness
of
the
lie
a
strict
inquiry
would
show
that
the
far
greater
part
of
the
account
is
a
most
impudent
lie
or
rather
string
of
lies
for
as
to
the
subterfuge
that
this
account
was
true
because
the
church
contain
it
is
an
addition
to
the
crime
of
lying
what
the
parliament
meant
was
what
is
the
greatest
number
of
persons
that
the
church
can
contain
at
worship
and
therefore
to
put
the
figure
of
against
the
church
of
sharncut
was
to
tell
the
parliament
a
wilful
lie
this
parish
is
a
rectory
it
has
great
and
small
tithes
it
has
a
glebe
and
a
good
solid
house
though
the
parson
says
it
is
unfit
for
him
to
live
in
in
short
he
is
not
here
a
curate
that
serves
perhaps
three
or
four
other
churches
comes
here
at
five
in
the
afternoon
the
for
making
out
the
returns
in
this
way
is
clear
enough
the
parsons
see
that
they
are
getting
what
they
get
in
a
declining
and
a
mouldering
country
the
size
of
the
church
tells
them
everything
tells
them
that
the
country
is
a
mean
and
miserable
thing
compared
with
what
it
was
in
former
times
they
feel
the
facts
but
they
wish
to
disguise
them
because
they
know
that
they
have
been
one
great
cause
of
the
country
being
in
its
present
impoverished
and
dilapidated
state
they
know
that
the
people
look
at
them
with
an
accusing
eye
and
they
wish
to
put
as
fair
a
face
as
they
can
upon
the
state
of
things
if
you
talk
to
them
they
will
never
acknowledge
that
there
is
any
misery
in
the
country
because
they
well
know
how
large
a
share
they
have
had
in
the
cause
of
it
they
were
always
haughty
and
insolent
but
the
times
made
them
ten
thousand
times
more
so
than
ever
the
cry
of
atheism
as
of
the
french
gave
these
fellows
of
ours
a
fine
time
of
it
they
became
identified
with
loyalty
and
what
was
more
with
property
and
at
one
time
to
say
or
hint
a
word
against
a
parson
do
what
he
would
was
to
be
an
enemy
of
god
and
of
all
property
those
were
the
glorious
times
for
them
they
urged
on
the
war
they
were
the
loudest
of
all
the
trumpeters
they
saw
their
tithes
in
danger
if
they
did
not
get
the
bourbons
restored
there
was
no
chance
of
tithes
in
france
and
then
the
example
might
be
fatal
but
they
forgot
that
to
restore
the
bourbons
a
debt
must
be
contracted
and
that
when
the
nation
could
not
pay
the
interest
of
that
debt
it
would
as
it
now
does
begin
to
look
hard
at
the
tithes
in
short
they
themselves
and
those
of
them
who
have
common
sense
now
see
it
each
hopes
that
the
thing
will
last
out
his
time
but
they
have
unless
they
be
a
constant
dread
upon
their
minds
this
makes
them
a
great
deal
less
brazen
than
they
used
to
be
and
i
dare
say
that
if
the
parliamentary
return
had
to
be
made
out
again
the
parson
of
sharncut
would
not
state
that
the
church
contain
from
sharncut
i
came
through
a
very
long
and
straggling
village
called
somerford
another
called
ocksey
and
another
called
crudwell
between
somerford
and
ocksey
i
saw
on
the
side
of
the
road
more
than
i
had
ever
seen
together
i
think
fifty
times
as
many
as
i
had
ever
seen
at
one
time
in
my
life
the
favourite
food
of
the
goldfinch
is
the
seed
of
the
this
seed
is
just
now
dead
ripe
the
thistles
are
all
cut
and
carried
away
from
the
fields
by
the
harvest
but
they
grow
alongside
the
roads
and
in
this
place
in
great
quantities
so
that
the
goldfinches
were
got
here
in
flocks
and
as
they
continued
to
fly
along
before
me
for
nearly
half
a
mile
and
still
sticking
to
the
road
and
the
banks
i
do
believe
i
had
at
last
a
flock
of
ten
thousand
flying
before
me
of
every
kind
including
partridges
and
pheasants
and
all
sorts
of
poultry
are
most
abundant
this
year
the
fine
long
summer
has
been
singularly
favourable
to
them
and
you
see
the
effect
of
it
in
the
great
broods
of
chickens
and
ducks
and
geese
and
turkeys
in
and
about
every
the
churches
of
the
villages
are
all
large
particularly
the
latter
which
is
capable
of
containing
very
conveniently
or
people
it
is
a
very
large
church
it
has
a
triple
roof
and
is
nearly
feet
long
and
master
parson
says
in
his
return
that
it
contain
people
at
ocksey
the
people
were
in
church
as
i
came
by
i
heard
the
singers
singing
and
as
the
was
close
by
the
i
got
off
my
horse
and
went
in
giving
my
horse
to
a
boy
to
hold
the
fellow
says
that
his
church
contain
people
i
counted
pews
for
about
the
singing
gallery
would
hold
or
of
the
area
of
the
church
have
no
pews
in
them
on
benches
these
would
hold
persons
taking
one
with
another
but
this
is
nothing
rare
the
same
sort
of
statement
has
been
made
the
same
kind
of
falsehoods
relative
to
the
whole
of
the
parishes
throughout
the
country
with
here
and
there
an
exception
everywhere
you
see
the
indubitable
marks
of
in
mansions
in
and
in
people
nothing
can
so
strongly
depict
the
great
decay
of
the
villages
as
the
state
of
the
which
are
so
many
parcels
of
public
property
and
to
prevent
the
dilapidation
of
which
there
are
laws
so
strict
since
i
left
devizes
i
have
passed
close
by
or
very
near
to
parish
churches
and
in
fifteen
out
of
these
parishes
the
are
stated
in
the
parliamentary
return
either
as
being
unfit
for
a
parson
to
live
in
or
as
being
wholly
tumbled
down
and
gone
what
then
are
there
scotch
vagabonds
are
there
chalmerses
and
colquhounds
to
swear
mon
that
pitt
and
jubilee
george
all
us
englishmen
and
that
there
were
only
a
few
stragglers
of
us
in
the
world
before
and
that
our
dark
and
ignorant
fathers
who
built
winchester
and
salisbury
cathedrals
had
neither
hands
nor
money
when
i
got
in
here
yesterday
i
went
at
first
to
an
inn
but
i
very
soon
changed
my
quarters
for
the
house
of
a
friend
who
and
whose
family
though
i
had
never
seen
them
before
and
had
never
heard
of
them
until
i
was
at
highworth
gave
me
a
hearty
reception
and
precisely
in
that
i
like
this
town
though
it
has
nothing
particularly
engaging
in
itself
stands
upon
one
of
the
prettiest
spots
that
can
be
imagined
besides
the
river
avon
which
i
went
down
in
the
part
of
the
country
here
is
another
river
avon
which
runs
down
to
bath
and
two
branches
or
sources
of
which
meet
here
there
is
a
pretty
ridge
of
ground
the
base
of
which
is
a
mile
or
a
mile
and
a
half
wide
on
each
side
of
this
ridge
a
branch
of
the
river
runs
down
through
a
flat
of
very
fine
meadows
the
town
and
the
beautiful
remains
of
the
famous
old
abbey
stand
on
the
rounded
spot
which
terminates
this
ridge
and
just
below
nearly
close
to
the
town
the
two
branches
of
the
river
meet
and
then
they
begin
to
be
called
the
land
round
about
is
excellent
and
of
a
great
variety
of
forms
the
trees
are
lofty
and
fine
so
that
what
with
the
water
the
meadows
the
fine
cattle
and
sheep
and
as
i
hear
the
absence
of
poverty
this
is
a
very
pleasant
place
there
remains
more
of
the
abbey
than
i
believe
of
any
of
our
monastic
buildings
except
that
of
westminster
and
those
that
have
become
cathedrals
the
is
performed
in
the
part
of
the
abbey
that
is
left
standing
the
parish
church
has
fallen
down
and
is
gone
but
the
tower
remains
which
is
made
use
of
for
the
bells
but
the
abbey
is
used
as
the
church
though
the
is
at
a
considerable
distance
from
it
it
was
once
a
most
magnificent
building
and
there
is
now
a
which
is
the
most
beautiful
thing
i
ever
saw
and
which
was
nevertheless
built
in
saxon
times
in
the
ages
and
was
built
by
men
who
were
not
begotten
by
pitt
nor
by
what
as
well
as
ungrateful
creatures
we
have
been
and
are
there
is
a
broken
arch
standing
off
from
the
sound
part
of
the
building
at
which
one
can
not
look
up
without
feeling
shame
at
the
thought
of
ever
having
abused
the
men
who
made
it
no
one
need
any
man
of
sense
he
our
inferiority
to
our
fathers
upon
merely
beholding
the
remains
of
their
efforts
to
ornament
their
country
and
elevate
the
minds
of
the
people
we
talk
of
our
skill
and
learning
indeed
how
do
we
know
how
skilful
how
learned
were
if
in
all
that
they
have
left
us
we
see
that
they
surpassed
us
why
are
we
to
conclude
that
they
did
not
surpass
us
in
all
other
things
worthy
of
admiration
this
famous
abbey
was
founded
in
about
the
year
by
maidulf
a
scotch
monk
who
upon
the
suppression
of
a
nunnery
here
at
that
time
selected
the
spot
for
this
great
establishment
for
the
great
magnificence
however
to
which
it
was
soon
after
brought
it
was
indebted
to
aldhelm
a
monk
educated
within
its
first
walls
by
the
founder
himself
and
to
aldhelm
who
by
his
great
virtues
became
very
famous
the
church
was
dedicated
in
the
time
of
king
edgar
this
monastery
continued
flourishing
during
those
ages
until
it
was
sacked
by
the
great
enlightener
at
which
time
it
was
found
to
be
endowed
to
the
amount
of
of
the
money
of
the
present
day
amongst
other
many
other
great
men
produced
by
this
abbey
of
malmsbury
was
that
famous
scholar
and
historian
william
de
malmsbury
there
is
a
in
this
town
the
sight
of
which
is
worth
a
journey
of
hundreds
of
miles
time
with
his
scythe
and
enlightened
protestant
piety
with
its
and
these
united
have
done
much
to
efface
the
beauties
of
this
monument
of
ancient
skill
and
taste
and
proof
of
ancient
wealth
but
in
spite
of
all
their
destructive
efforts
this
cross
still
remains
a
most
beautiful
thing
though
possibly
and
even
probably
nearly
or
quite
a
thousand
years
old
there
is
a
lately
erected
at
devizes
and
intended
to
imitate
the
ancient
ones
compare
that
with
this
and
then
you
have
pretty
fairly
a
view
of
the
difference
between
us
and
our
forefathers
of
the
dark
ages
i
start
for
bollitree
near
ross
herefordshire
my
road
being
across
the
county
and
through
the
city
of
gloucester
ride
from
malmsbury
in
wiltshire
through
gloucestershire
herefordshire
and
worcestershire
gloucestershire
tuesday
forenoon
i
set
off
from
malmsbury
this
morning
at
in
as
sweet
and
bright
a
morning
as
ever
came
out
of
the
heavens
and
leaving
behind
me
as
pleasant
a
house
and
as
kind
hosts
as
i
ever
met
with
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
either
in
england
or
america
and
that
is
saying
a
great
deal
indeed
this
circumstance
was
the
more
pleasant
as
i
had
never
before
either
seen
or
heard
of
these
kind
unaffected
sensible
and
most
agreeable
friends
from
malmsbury
i
first
came
at
the
end
of
five
miles
to
tutbury
which
is
in
gloucestershire
there
being
here
a
sort
of
dell
or
ravine
which
in
this
place
is
the
boundary
line
of
the
two
counties
and
over
which
you
go
on
a
bridge
of
which
belongs
to
each
county
and
now
before
i
take
my
leave
of
wiltshire
i
must
observe
that
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
days
of
excepted
of
course
i
never
passed
seventeen
pleasanter
days
than
those
which
i
have
just
spent
in
wiltshire
it
is
especially
in
the
southern
half
just
the
sort
of
country
that
i
like
the
weather
has
been
pleasant
i
have
been
in
good
houses
and
amongst
good
and
beautiful
gardens
and
in
case
i
have
not
only
been
most
kindly
entertained
but
my
entertainers
have
been
of
just
the
stamp
that
i
like
i
saw
again
this
morning
large
flocks
of
feeding
on
the
on
the
roadside
the
french
call
this
bird
by
a
name
derived
from
the
thistle
so
notorious
has
it
always
been
that
they
live
upon
this
seed
is
in
french
and
the
french
call
this
beautiful
little
bird
i
never
could
have
supposed
that
such
flocks
of
these
birds
would
ever
be
seen
in
england
but
it
is
a
great
year
for
all
the
feathered
race
whether
wild
or
tame
naturally
so
indeed
for
every
one
knows
that
it
is
the
and
not
the
that
is
injurious
to
the
breeding
of
birds
of
all
sorts
whether
or
they
say
that
there
are
this
year
double
the
usual
quantity
of
ducks
and
geese
and
really
they
do
seem
to
swarm
in
the
farmyards
wherever
i
go
it
is
a
great
mistake
to
suppose
that
ducks
and
geese
water
except
to
drink
there
is
perhaps
no
spot
in
the
world
in
proportion
to
its
size
and
population
where
so
many
of
these
birds
are
reared
and
fatted
as
in
long
island
and
it
is
not
in
one
case
out
of
ten
that
they
have
any
ponds
to
go
to
or
that
they
ever
see
any
water
other
than
water
that
is
drawn
up
out
of
a
well
a
little
way
before
i
got
to
tutbury
i
saw
a
woman
digging
some
potatoes
in
a
strip
of
ground
making
part
of
a
field
nearly
an
oblong
square
and
which
field
appeared
to
be
laid
out
in
strips
she
told
me
that
the
field
was
part
of
a
farm
to
the
homestead
of
which
she
pointed
that
it
was
by
the
farmer
in
strips
to
labouring
people
that
each
strip
contained
a
rood
or
quarter
of
a
statute
acre
that
each
married
labourer
rented
one
strip
and
that
the
annual
rent
was
for
the
strip
now
the
taxes
being
all
paid
by
the
farmer
the
fences
being
kept
in
repair
by
him
and
as
appeared
to
me
the
land
being
exceedingly
good
all
these
things
considered
the
rent
does
not
appear
to
be
too
this
fashion
is
certainly
a
one
it
is
a
little
step
towards
a
coming
back
to
the
ancient
small
life
and
lease
holds
and
this
field
of
strips
was
in
fact
a
sort
of
and
the
agriculturists
as
the
conceited
asses
of
landlords
call
themselves
at
their
clubs
and
meetings
might
and
they
would
if
their
skulls
could
admit
any
thoughts
except
such
as
relate
to
high
prices
and
low
wages
they
might
and
they
would
begin
to
suspect
that
the
dark
age
people
were
not
so
very
foolish
when
they
had
so
many
and
when
almost
every
man
that
had
a
family
had
also
a
bit
of
land
either
large
or
small
it
is
a
very
curious
thing
that
the
enclosing
of
commons
that
the
shutting
out
of
the
labourers
all
in
the
land
that
the
prohibiting
of
them
to
look
at
a
wild
animal
almost
at
a
lark
or
a
frog
it
is
curious
that
this
system
should
have
gone
on
until
at
last
it
has
produced
effects
so
injurious
and
so
dangerous
to
the
grinders
themselves
that
they
have
of
their
own
accord
and
for
their
own
safety
begun
to
make
a
step
towards
the
ancient
system
and
have
in
the
manner
i
have
observed
made
the
labourers
sharers
in
some
degree
in
the
uses
at
any
rate
of
the
soil
the
far
greater
part
of
these
strips
of
land
have
potatoes
growing
in
them
but
in
some
cases
they
have
borne
wheat
and
in
others
barley
this
year
and
these
have
now
turnips
very
young
most
of
them
but
in
some
places
very
fine
and
in
every
instance
nicely
hoed
out
the
land
that
will
bear
bushels
of
potatoes
to
the
acre
will
bear
bushels
of
wheat
and
the
ten
bushels
of
wheat
to
the
quarter
of
an
acre
would
be
a
crop
far
more
valuable
than
a
hundred
bushels
of
potatoes
as
i
have
proved
many
times
in
the
register
just
before
i
got
into
tutbury
i
was
met
by
a
good
many
people
in
twos
threes
or
fives
some
running
and
some
walking
fast
one
of
the
first
of
whom
asked
me
if
i
had
met
an
old
man
some
distance
back
i
asked
what
of
a
man
a
man
i
do
recollect
indeed
but
what
are
you
all
pursuing
him
for
he
has
been
what
has
he
been
stealing
cabbages
where
out
of
glover
the
hatter
garden
what
do
you
call
that
and
would
you
punish
a
man
a
poor
man
and
therefore
in
all
likelihood
a
hungry
man
too
and
moreover
an
old
man
do
you
set
up
a
after
and
would
you
punish
such
a
man
for
taking
a
few
cabbages
when
that
holy
bible
which
i
dare
say
you
profess
to
believe
in
and
perhaps
assist
to
circulate
teaches
you
that
the
hungry
man
may
without
committing
any
offence
at
all
go
into
his
neighbour
vineyard
and
eat
his
fill
of
grapes
one
bunch
of
which
is
worth
a
of
cabbages
yes
but
he
is
a
very
bad
character
why
my
friend
very
poor
and
almost
starved
people
are
apt
to
be
characters
but
the
bible
in
both
testaments
commands
us
to
be
merciful
to
the
poor
to
feed
the
hungry
to
have
compassion
on
the
aged
and
it
makes
no
exception
as
to
the
of
the
parties
another
group
or
two
of
the
pursuers
had
come
up
by
this
time
and
i
bearing
in
mind
the
fate
of
don
quixote
when
he
interfered
in
somewhat
similar
cases
gave
my
horse
the
hint
and
soon
got
away
but
though
doubtless
i
made
no
converts
i
upon
looking
back
perceived
that
i
had
slackened
the
pursuit
the
pursuers
went
more
slowly
i
could
see
that
they
got
to
talking
it
was
now
the
step
of
deliberation
rather
than
that
of
decision
and
though
i
did
not
like
to
call
upon
glover
i
hope
he
was
merciful
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
witness
scenes
like
this
to
hear
a
man
called
for
such
a
cause
to
see
him
thus
eagerly
and
vindictively
pursued
for
having
taken
some
cabbages
in
a
garden
it
is
impossible
for
me
to
behold
such
a
scene
without
calling
to
mind
the
practice
in
the
united
states
of
america
where
if
a
man
were
even
to
talk
of
prosecuting
another
especially
if
that
other
were
poor
or
old
for
taking
from
the
land
or
from
the
trees
any
part
of
a
growing
crop
for
his
own
personal
and
immediate
use
if
any
man
were
even
to
talk
of
prosecuting
another
for
such
an
act
such
talker
would
be
held
in
universal
abhorrence
people
would
hate
him
and
in
short
if
rich
as
ricardo
or
baring
he
might
live
by
himself
for
no
man
would
look
upon
him
as
a
neighbour
tutbury
is
a
very
pretty
town
and
has
a
beautiful
ancient
church
the
country
is
high
along
here
for
a
mile
or
two
towards
avening
which
begins
a
long
and
deep
and
narrow
valley
that
comes
all
the
way
down
to
stroud
when
i
got
to
the
end
of
the
high
country
and
the
lower
country
opened
to
my
view
i
was
at
about
three
miles
from
tutbury
on
the
road
to
avening
leaving
the
road
to
my
right
here
i
was
upon
the
edge
of
the
high
land
looking
right
down
upon
the
village
of
avening
and
seeing
just
close
to
it
a
large
and
fine
a
beautiful
park
and
making
part
of
the
park
one
of
the
finest
most
magnificent
woods
of
acres
i
dare
say
lying
facing
me
going
from
a
valley
up
a
hill
while
i
was
sitting
on
my
horse
admiring
this
spot
a
man
came
along
with
some
tools
in
his
hand
as
if
going
somewhere
to
work
as
plumber
whose
beautiful
place
is
that
said
i
one
ricardo
i
think
they
call
him
but
you
might
have
knocked
me
down
with
a
feather
as
the
old
women
say
but
continued
the
plumber
the
old
gentleman
dead
and
god
the
old
gentleman
and
the
young
gentleman
too
said
i
and
giving
my
horse
a
blow
instead
of
a
word
on
i
went
down
the
hill
before
i
got
to
the
bottom
my
reflections
on
the
present
state
of
the
market
and
on
the
probable
results
of
watching
the
turn
of
it
had
made
me
better
humoured
and
as
one
of
the
first
objects
that
struck
my
eye
in
the
village
was
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
of
the
red
or
bloody
cross
too
i
asked
the
landlord
some
questions
which
began
a
series
of
joking
and
bantering
that
i
had
with
the
people
from
one
end
of
the
village
to
the
other
i
set
them
all
a
laughing
and
though
they
could
not
know
my
name
they
will
remember
me
for
a
long
this
estate
of
gatcomb
belonged
i
am
told
to
a
shepperd
and
to
his
fathers
before
him
i
asked
where
this
shepperd
was
now
a
man
told
me
that
he
did
not
know
where
he
was
but
that
he
had
heard
that
he
was
living
somewhere
near
to
bath
thus
they
go
thus
they
are
squeezed
out
of
existence
the
little
ones
are
gone
and
the
big
ones
have
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
resort
to
the
bands
of
holy
matrimony
with
the
turn
of
the
market
watchers
and
their
breed
this
the
big
ones
are
now
doing
apace
and
there
is
this
comfort
at
any
rate
namely
that
the
connection
can
not
make
them
baser
than
they
are
a
boroughmonger
being
of
all
god
creatures
the
very
basest
from
avening
i
came
on
through
nailsworth
woodchester
and
rodborough
to
this
place
these
villages
lie
on
the
sides
of
a
narrow
and
deep
valley
with
a
narrow
stream
of
water
running
down
the
middle
of
it
and
this
stream
turns
the
wheels
of
a
great
many
mills
and
sets
of
machinery
for
the
making
of
the
factories
begin
at
avening
and
are
scattered
all
the
way
down
the
valley
there
are
as
well
as
water
powers
the
work
and
the
trade
is
so
flat
that
in
i
should
think
much
more
than
a
hundred
acres
of
ground
which
i
have
seen
covered
with
rails
or
racks
for
the
drying
of
cloth
i
do
not
think
that
i
have
seen
one
single
acre
where
the
racks
had
cloth
upon
them
the
workmen
do
not
get
half
wages
great
numbers
are
thrown
on
the
parish
but
overseers
and
magistrates
in
this
part
of
england
do
not
presume
that
they
are
to
leave
anybody
to
starve
to
death
there
is
law
here
this
is
in
england
and
not
in
the
north
where
those
who
ought
to
see
that
the
poor
do
not
suffer
talk
of
their
dying
with
hunger
as
irish
do
aye
and
applaud
them
for
their
patient
resignation
the
gloucestershire
people
have
no
notion
of
dying
with
hunger
and
it
is
with
great
pleasure
that
i
remark
that
i
have
seen
no
creature
this
day
the
here
is
a
yellowish
ugly
stone
the
houses
are
all
built
with
this
and
it
being
ugly
the
stone
is
made
by
a
wash
of
some
sort
or
other
the
land
on
both
sides
of
the
valley
and
all
down
the
bottom
of
it
has
plenty
of
trees
on
it
it
is
chiefly
pasture
land
so
that
the
green
and
the
white
colours
and
the
form
and
great
variety
of
the
ground
and
the
water
and
altogether
make
this
a
very
pretty
ride
here
are
a
series
of
spots
every
one
of
which
a
lover
of
landscapes
would
like
to
have
painted
even
the
buildings
of
the
factories
are
not
ugly
the
people
seem
to
have
been
constantly
well
off
a
pig
in
almost
every
cottage
sty
and
that
is
the
infallible
mark
of
a
happy
people
at
present
indeed
this
valley
suffers
and
though
cloth
will
always
be
wanted
there
will
yet
be
much
suffering
even
here
while
at
uly
and
other
places
they
say
that
the
suffering
is
great
indeed
between
gloucester
and
from
stroud
i
came
up
to
pitchcomb
leaving
painswick
on
my
right
from
the
lofty
hill
at
pitchcomb
i
looked
down
into
that
great
flat
and
almost
circular
vale
of
which
the
city
of
gloucester
is
in
the
centre
to
the
left
i
saw
the
severn
become
a
sort
of
arm
of
the
sea
and
before
me
i
saw
the
hills
that
divide
this
county
from
herefordshire
and
worcestershire
the
hill
is
a
mile
down
when
down
you
are
amongst
and
orchards
all
the
way
to
gloucester
and
this
year
the
orchards
particularly
those
of
pears
are
greatly
productive
i
intended
to
sleep
at
gloucester
as
i
had
when
there
already
come
miles
and
as
the
fourteen
which
remained
for
me
to
go
in
order
to
reach
bollitree
in
herefordshire
would
make
about
nine
more
than
either
i
or
my
horse
had
a
taste
for
but
when
i
came
to
gloucester
i
found
that
i
should
run
a
risk
of
having
no
bed
if
i
did
not
bow
very
low
and
pay
very
high
for
what
should
there
be
here
but
one
of
those
scandalous
and
beastly
fruits
of
the
system
called
a
those
who
founded
the
cathedrals
never
dreamed
i
dare
say
that
they
would
have
been
put
to
such
uses
as
this
they
are
upon
these
occasions
made
use
of
as
and
i
am
told
that
the
money
which
is
collected
goes
in
some
shape
or
another
to
the
clergy
of
the
church
or
their
widows
or
children
or
something
these
assemblages
of
and
began
with
the
small
and
with
it
they
will
go
they
are
amongst
the
profligate
pranks
which
idleness
plays
when
fed
by
the
sweat
of
a
starving
people
from
this
scene
of
prostitution
and
of
i
moved
off
with
all
convenient
speed
but
not
before
the
ostler
made
me
pay
for
merely
letting
my
horse
about
ten
minutes
and
not
before
he
had
to
abuse
me
for
declining
though
in
a
very
polite
manner
to
make
him
a
present
in
addition
to
the
how
he
ended
i
do
not
know
for
i
soon
set
the
noise
of
the
shoes
of
my
horse
to
answer
him
i
got
to
this
village
about
eight
miles
from
gloucester
by
five
it
is
now
half
past
seven
and
i
am
going
to
bed
with
an
intention
of
getting
to
bollitree
six
miles
only
early
enough
in
the
morning
to
catch
my
sons
in
bed
if
they
play
the
sluggard
wednesday
this
morning
was
most
beautiful
there
has
been
rain
here
now
and
the
grass
begins
but
only
begins
to
grow
when
i
got
within
two
hundred
yards
of
palmer
i
had
the
happiness
to
meet
my
son
richard
who
said
that
he
had
been
up
an
hour
as
i
came
along
i
saw
one
of
the
prettiest
sights
in
the
way
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
it
was
a
little
orchard
the
grass
in
it
had
just
taken
a
start
and
was
beautifully
fresh
and
very
thickly
growing
amongst
the
grass
was
the
purple
flowered
in
full
bloom
they
say
that
the
leaves
of
this
plant
which
come
out
in
the
spring
and
die
away
in
the
summer
are
poisonous
to
cattle
if
they
eat
much
of
them
in
the
spring
the
flower
if
standing
by
itself
would
be
no
great
beauty
but
contrasted
thus
with
the
fresh
grass
which
was
a
little
shorter
than
itself
it
was
very
beautiful
saturday
upon
my
arrival
here
which
as
the
reader
has
seen
was
ten
days
ago
i
had
a
parcel
of
to
open
amongst
which
were
a
large
lot
from
correspondents
who
had
been
good
enough
to
set
me
right
with
regard
to
that
conceited
and
impudent
plagiarist
or
literary
thief
sir
james
graham
baronet
of
netherby
one
correspondent
says
that
i
have
reversed
the
rule
of
the
decalogue
by
visiting
the
sins
of
the
son
upon
the
father
another
tells
me
anecdotes
about
the
magnus
apollo
i
hereby
do
the
father
justice
by
saying
that
from
what
i
have
now
heard
of
him
i
am
induced
to
believe
that
he
would
have
been
ashamed
to
commit
flagrant
acts
of
plagiarism
which
the
son
has
been
guilty
of
the
whole
of
this
plagiarist
pamphlet
is
bad
enough
every
part
of
it
is
contemptible
but
the
passage
in
which
he
says
that
there
was
no
man
of
any
authority
who
did
not
the
distress
that
would
arise
out
of
peel
bill
this
passage
merits
a
at
the
hands
of
any
englishman
that
chooses
to
lay
it
on
and
particularly
from
me
as
to
in
herefordshire
and
gloucestershire
they
have
been
very
bad
even
the
wheat
here
has
been
only
a
part
crop
the
barley
and
oats
really
next
to
nothing
by
cattle
and
sheep
in
many
places
partly
for
want
of
grass
and
partly
from
their
worthlessness
the
cattle
have
been
nearly
starved
in
many
places
and
we
hear
the
same
from
worcestershire
in
some
places
one
of
these
beautiful
calves
last
spring
calves
will
be
given
for
the
wintering
of
another
hay
at
stroud
was
six
pounds
a
ton
last
year
it
was
a
ton
and
yet
meat
and
cheese
are
lower
in
price
than
they
were
last
year
mutton
i
mean
alive
was
last
year
at
this
time
it
is
now
there
has
been
in
north
wilts
and
in
gloucestershire
half
the
quantity
of
cheese
made
this
year
and
yet
the
price
is
lower
than
it
was
last
year
wool
is
half
the
last
year
price
there
has
within
these
three
weeks
or
a
month
been
a
prodigious
increase
in
the
quantity
of
cattle
food
the
grass
looks
like
the
grass
late
in
may
and
the
late
and
of
which
immense
quantities
have
been
sown
have
grown
very
much
and
promise
large
crops
generally
yet
lean
sheep
have
at
the
recent
fairs
fallen
in
price
they
have
been
lessening
in
price
while
the
facility
of
keeping
them
has
been
augmenting
aye
but
the
has
not
been
augmenting
notwithstanding
the
at
gloucester
this
bank
is
quite
ready
they
say
to
take
deposits
that
is
to
say
to
keep
people
spare
money
for
them
but
to
lend
them
none
without
such
security
as
would
get
money
even
from
the
claws
of
a
miser
this
trick
is
then
what
the
french
call
a
or
a
missing
of
the
mark
in
spite
of
everything
as
to
the
season
calculated
to
cause
lean
sheep
to
rise
in
price
they
fell
i
hear
at
wilton
fair
near
salisbury
on
the
instant
from
to
a
head
and
yesterday
at
newent
fair
there
was
a
fall
since
the
last
fair
in
this
neighbourhood
palmer
sold
at
this
fair
sheep
for
a
head
rather
better
than
some
which
he
sold
at
the
same
fair
last
year
for
a
head
so
that
here
is
a
falling
off
of
a
third
think
of
the
dreadful
ruin
then
which
must
fall
upon
the
renting
farmers
whether
they
rent
the
land
or
rent
the
money
which
enables
them
to
call
the
land
their
own
the
recent
order
in
council
ruined
many
i
was
a
few
days
after
that
order
reached
us
in
wiltshire
in
a
rick
yard
looking
at
the
ricks
amongst
which
were
two
of
beans
i
asked
the
farmer
how
much
the
order
would
take
out
of
his
pocket
and
he
said
it
had
already
taken
out
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
this
is
a
pretty
state
of
things
for
a
man
to
live
in
the
winds
are
less
uncertain
than
this
calling
of
a
farmer
is
now
become
though
it
is
a
calling
the
affairs
of
which
have
always
been
deemed
as
little
liable
to
accident
as
anything
human
the
best
public
instructor
tells
us
that
the
ministers
are
about
to
give
the
to
the
poor
manufacturers
coats
waistcoats
trousers
shoes
and
stockings
oh
what
a
kind
as
well
as
wise
envy
of
surrounding
nations
this
is
dear
good
souls
but
what
are
the
to
do
no
pretty
gentlemen
no
royal
commission
to
be
appointed
to
distribute
smocks
to
the
suffering
females
of
the
districts
how
fine
our
manufacturing
population
will
look
all
dressed
in
then
indeed
will
the
farming
fellows
have
to
repent
that
they
did
not
follow
the
advice
of
black
and
fly
to
the
manufacturing
districts
where
employment
as
the
doctor
affirmed
was
so
abundant
and
so
permanent
and
where
wages
were
so
high
out
of
evil
comes
good
and
this
state
of
things
has
blown
the
scotch
to
the
devil
at
any
rate
in
spite
of
all
their
plausibility
and
persevering
brass
the
scotch
writers
are
now
generally
looked
upon
as
so
many
tricky
humbugs
sedgwick
affair
is
enough
one
would
think
to
open
men
eyes
to
the
character
of
this
greedy
band
of
for
invaders
they
are
and
of
the
very
worst
sort
they
come
only
to
live
on
the
labour
of
others
never
to
work
themselves
and
while
they
do
this
they
are
everlastingly
publishing
essays
the
object
of
which
is
to
keep
the
irish
out
of
england
black
has
within
these
four
years
published
more
than
a
hundred
articles
in
which
he
has
represented
the
invasion
of
the
irish
as
being
ruinous
to
england
what
monstrous
impudence
the
irish
come
to
help
do
the
work
the
scotch
to
help
eat
the
taxes
or
to
tramp
with
a
pack
and
licence
or
in
other
words
to
cheat
upon
a
small
scale
as
their
superiors
do
upon
a
large
one
this
tricky
and
greedy
set
have
however
at
last
overreached
themselves
after
having
so
long
overreached
all
the
rest
of
mankind
that
have
had
the
misfortune
to
come
in
contact
with
them
they
are
now
smarting
under
the
scourge
the
torments
of
which
they
have
long
made
others
feel
they
have
been
the
principal
inventors
and
executors
of
all
that
has
been
damnable
to
england
they
are
bothered
and
i
thank
god
for
it
it
may
and
it
must
finally
deliver
us
from
their
baleful
influence
to
return
to
the
kind
and
pretty
gentlemen
of
whitehall
and
their
if
they
refuse
to
supply
the
women
with
smocks
perhaps
they
would
have
no
objection
to
hand
them
over
some
petticoats
or
at
any
rate
to
give
their
husbands
a
a
piece
and
a
little
powder
and
ball
just
to
amuse
themselves
with
instead
of
the
employment
of
digging
holes
one
day
and
filling
them
up
the
next
as
suggested
by
the
great
statesman
now
no
more
who
was
one
of
that
noble
honourable
and
venerable
body
the
privy
council
to
which
sturges
bourne
belongs
and
who
cut
his
own
throat
at
north
cray
in
kent
just
about
three
years
after
he
had
brought
in
the
bill
which
compelled
me
to
make
the
register
contain
two
sheets
and
a
quarter
and
to
compel
printers
to
give
before
they
began
to
print
bail
to
pay
any
fines
that
might
be
inflicted
on
them
for
anything
that
they
might
print
let
me
see
where
was
i
oh
the
muskets
and
powder
and
ball
ought
certainly
to
go
with
the
red
clothes
but
how
strange
it
is
that
the
never
seems
to
occur
even
for
one
single
moment
to
the
minds
of
these
pretty
gentlemen
namely
off
the
what
a
thing
it
is
to
behold
poor
people
receiving
taxes
or
alms
to
prevent
them
from
starving
and
to
behold
one
half
at
least
of
what
they
receive
taken
from
them
in
taxes
what
a
sight
to
behold
soldiers
horse
and
foot
employed
to
prevent
a
distressed
people
from
committing
acts
of
violence
when
the
of
the
horse
and
foot
would
probably
if
applied
in
the
way
of
relief
to
the
sufferers
prevent
the
existence
of
the
distress
a
cavalry
horse
has
i
think
ten
pounds
of
oats
a
day
and
twenty
pounds
of
hay
these
at
present
prices
cost
a
week
then
there
is
stable
room
barracks
straw
saddle
and
all
the
trappings
then
there
is
the
wear
of
the
horse
then
the
pay
of
them
so
that
one
single
horseman
with
his
horse
do
not
cost
so
little
as
a
week
and
that
is
more
than
the
parish
allowance
to
five
labourers
or
manufacturers
families
at
five
to
a
family
so
that
one
horseman
and
his
horse
cost
what
would
feed
of
the
distressed
creatures
if
there
be
ten
thousand
of
these
horsemen
they
cost
as
much
as
would
keep
at
the
parish
rate
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
of
the
distressed
persons
aye
it
is
even
so
parson
hay
stare
at
it
as
long
as
you
like
but
suppose
it
to
be
only
half
as
much
then
it
would
maintain
a
hundred
and
thousand
persons
however
to
get
rid
of
all
dispute
and
to
state
one
staring
and
undeniable
fact
let
me
first
observe
that
it
is
notorious
that
the
are
looked
upon
as
enormous
that
they
are
deemed
an
insupportable
burden
that
scarlett
and
nolan
have
asserted
that
they
threaten
to
swallow
up
the
land
that
it
is
equally
notorious
that
a
large
part
of
the
ought
to
be
called
all
this
is
undeniable
and
now
comes
the
damning
fact
namely
that
the
whole
amount
of
these
falls
far
short
of
the
cost
of
the
standing
army
in
time
of
peace
so
that
take
away
this
army
which
is
to
keep
the
distressed
people
from
committing
acts
of
violence
and
you
have
at
once
ample
means
of
removing
all
the
distress
and
all
the
danger
of
acts
of
violence
will
this
be
done
do
not
say
reader
if
you
do
you
are
not
only
a
slave
but
you
ought
to
be
one
i
can
not
dismiss
this
affair
without
remarking
that
i
do
not
agree
with
those
who
the
ministers
for
having
let
in
the
foreign
corn
of
why
not
do
it
from
that
motive
the
fear
of
the
lord
is
the
beginning
of
wisdom
and
what
is
meaned
by
fear
of
the
lord
but
the
fear
of
doing
wrong
or
of
persevering
in
doing
wrong
and
whence
is
this
fear
to
arise
from
thinking
of
the
to
be
sure
and
therefore
if
the
ministers
did
let
in
the
foreign
corn
for
fear
of
popular
commotion
they
acted
rightly
and
their
motive
was
as
good
and
reasonable
as
the
act
was
wise
and
just
it
would
have
been
lucky
for
them
if
the
same
sort
of
motive
had
prevailed
when
the
corn
bill
was
passed
but
that
statesman
who
at
last
sent
a
spur
into
his
own
throat
was
then
in
high
feather
and
he
while
soldiers
were
drawn
up
round
the
honourable
honourable
honourable
house
said
that
he
did
not
for
his
part
care
much
about
the
bill
but
since
the
mob
had
clamoured
against
he
was
resolved
to
support
it
alas
that
such
a
statesman
should
have
come
to
such
an
end
all
the
towns
and
cities
in
england
petitioned
against
that
odious
bill
their
petitions
were
rejected
and
that
rejection
is
the
causes
of
the
present
embarrassments
therefore
i
am
not
for
blaming
the
ministers
for
acting
from
they
did
the
same
in
the
case
of
the
poor
queen
fear
taught
them
wisely
then
also
what
would
you
never
have
people
act
from
what
but
fear
of
the
law
restrains
many
men
from
committing
crimes
what
but
fear
of
exposure
prevents
thousands
upon
thousands
of
offences
moral
as
well
as
legal
nonsense
about
acting
from
fear
i
always
hear
with
great
suspicion
your
eulogists
of
government
i
do
not
like
your
vigorous
governments
your
governments
we
saw
enough
of
these
and
enough
of
them
too
under
pitt
dundas
perceval
gibbs
ellenborough
sidmouth
and
castlereagh
i
prefer
governments
like
those
of
edward
of
england
and
louis
of
france
as
towards
their
enemies
and
rivals
and
as
towards
their
own
people
precisely
the
reverse
of
our
modern
country
gentlemen
as
they
call
themselves
very
lions
as
towards
their
poor
robbed
famishing
labourers
but
more
than
lambs
as
towards
and
especially
as
towards
the
fierce
and
whiskered
in
the
presence
of
any
of
whom
they
dare
not
say
that
their
souls
are
their
own
this
base
race
of
men
called
country
gentlemen
must
be
speedily
changed
by
almost
a
miracle
or
they
big
as
well
as
little
must
be
swept
away
and
if
it
should
be
desirable
for
posterity
to
have
a
just
idea
of
them
let
posterity
take
this
one
fact
that
the
tithes
are
now
in
part
received
by
men
who
are
rectors
and
vicars
and
who
at
the
same
time
receive
as
naval
or
military
officers
and
that
not
one
english
country
gentleman
has
had
the
courage
even
to
complain
of
this
though
many
gallant
officers
have
been
dismissed
and
beggared
upon
the
ground
that
the
is
not
a
reward
for
past
services
but
a
retaining
fee
for
future
services
so
that
put
the
two
together
they
amount
to
this
that
the
is
given
to
church
parsons
that
they
may
be
when
war
comes
ready
to
serve
as
officers
in
the
army
or
navy
let
the
world
match
that
if
it
can
and
yet
there
are
scoundrels
to
say
that
we
do
not
want
a
why
there
must
be
such
a
reform
in
order
to
prevent
us
from
becoming
a
mass
of
wretches
too
corrupt
and
profligate
and
base
even
to
carry
on
the
common
transactions
of
life
near
upton
on
severn
worcestershire
monday
i
set
off
from
palmer
yesterday
after
breakfast
having
his
son
about
years
old
as
my
travelling
companion
we
came
across
the
country
a
distance
of
about
miles
and
having
crossed
the
severn
at
upton
arrived
here
at
john
price
about
two
on
our
road
we
passed
by
the
estate
and
park
of
this
is
osmond
the
other
is
david
this
one
has
ousted
two
families
of
normans
the
honeywood
yateses
and
the
scudamores
they
suppose
him
to
have
ten
thousand
pounds
a
year
in
rent
here
famous
watching
the
turn
of
the
market
the
barings
are
at
work
down
in
this
country
too
they
are
everywhere
indeed
depositing
their
eggs
about
like
cunning
old
in
sly
places
besides
the
great
open
showy
nests
that
they
have
the
instructor
tells
us
that
the
ricardos
have
received
thousand
pounds
commission
on
the
greek
loans
or
rather
loans
to
the
greeks
oh
brave
greeks
to
have
such
patriots
to
aid
you
with
their
financial
skill
such
patriots
as
galloway
to
make
engines
of
war
for
you
while
his
son
is
making
them
for
the
turks
and
such
patriots
as
burdett
and
hobhouse
to
talk
of
your
political
relations
happy
greeks
happy
mexicans
too
it
seems
for
the
best
instructor
tells
us
that
the
barings
whose
progenitors
came
from
dutchland
about
the
same
time
as
and
perhaps
in
company
with
the
ricardos
happy
mexicans
too
for
the
instructor
as
good
as
swears
that
the
barings
will
see
that
the
dividends
on
your
loans
are
paid
in
future
now
therefore
the
riches
the
loads
the
shiploads
of
silver
and
gold
are
now
to
pour
in
upon
us
never
was
there
a
nation
so
foolish
as
this
but
and
this
ought
to
be
well
understood
it
is
not
foolishness
not
mere
harmless
folly
it
is
foolishness
the
offspring
of
and
of
a
which
is
little
short
of
a
disposition
and
this
disposition
prevails
to
an
enormous
extent
in
the
country
as
i
am
told
more
than
in
the
monstrous
wen
itself
most
delightfully
however
have
the
greedy
mercenary
selfish
unfeeling
wretches
been
bit
by
the
and
the
king
of
spain
gave
the
wretches
a
sharp
bite
for
which
i
always
most
cordially
thank
his
majesty
i
dare
say
that
his
sponging
off
of
the
roguish
bonds
has
reduced
to
beggary
or
caused
to
cut
their
throats
many
thousands
of
the
greedy
devils
who
if
they
regard
it
likely
to
raise
their
securities
one
per
would
applaud
the
murder
of
half
the
human
race
these
vermin
all
without
a
single
exception
approved
of
and
rejoiced
at
and
they
applauded
his
of
thanks
to
the
manchester
yeomanry
no
matter
what
it
is
that
puts
an
end
to
a
system
which
engenders
and
breeds
up
vermin
like
these
hanford
of
this
county
and
canning
of
gloucestershire
having
dined
at
price
yesterday
i
went
with
price
to
see
hanford
at
his
house
and
estate
at
bredon
hill
which
is
i
believe
one
of
the
highest
in
england
the
ridge
or
rather
the
edge
of
it
divides
in
this
part
worcestershire
from
gloucestershire
at
the
very
highest
part
of
it
there
are
the
remains
of
an
encampment
or
rather
i
should
think
citadel
in
many
instances
in
wiltshire
these
marks
of
fortifications
are
called
castles
still
and
doubtless
there
were
once
castles
on
these
spots
from
bredon
hill
you
see
into
nine
or
ten
counties
and
those
curious
the
malvern
hills
are
right
before
you
and
only
at
about
ten
miles
distance
in
a
straight
line
as
this
hill
looks
over
the
counties
of
worcester
gloucester
hereford
and
part
of
warwick
and
the
rich
part
of
stafford
and
as
it
looks
over
the
vales
of
esham
worcester
and
gloucester
having
the
avon
and
the
severn
winding
down
them
you
certainly
see
from
this
bredon
hill
one
of
the
very
richest
spots
of
england
and
i
am
fully
convinced
a
richer
spot
than
is
to
be
seen
in
any
other
country
in
the
world
i
mean
of
course
for
fear
sawney
should
cut
my
throat
or
which
is
much
the
same
thing
squeeze
me
by
the
hand
from
which
last
i
pray
thee
to
deliver
me
o
lord
the
avon
this
is
the
avon
that
i
have
crossed
in
this
ride
falls
into
the
severn
just
below
tewkesbury
through
which
town
we
went
in
our
way
to
hanford
these
rivers
particularly
the
severn
go
through
and
sometimes
overflow
the
finest
meadows
of
which
it
is
possible
to
form
an
idea
some
of
them
contain
more
than
a
hundred
acres
each
and
the
number
of
cattle
and
sheep
feeding
in
them
is
prodigious
of
the
land
in
these
extensive
vales
appears
to
me
to
be
pasture
and
it
is
pasture
of
the
richest
kind
the
sheep
are
chiefly
of
the
leicester
breed
and
the
cattle
of
the
hereford
white
face
and
dark
red
body
certainly
the
finest
and
most
beautiful
of
all
the
grass
after
the
fine
rains
that
we
have
had
is
in
its
finest
possible
dress
but
here
as
in
the
parts
of
gloucestershire
and
herefordshire
that
i
have
seen
there
are
no
turnips
except
those
which
have
been
recently
sown
and
though
amidst
all
these
thousands
upon
thousands
of
acres
of
the
finest
meadows
and
grass
land
in
the
world
hay
is
i
hear
seven
pounds
a
ton
at
worcester
however
unless
we
should
have
very
early
and
even
hard
frosts
the
grass
will
be
so
abundant
that
the
cattle
and
sheep
will
do
better
than
people
are
apt
to
think
but
be
this
as
it
may
this
summer
has
taught
us
that
our
climate
is
the
for
after
all
and
that
we
can
not
have
italian
sun
and
english
meat
and
cheese
we
complain
of
the
but
it
is
the
drip
that
makes
the
beef
and
the
mutton
hanford
house
is
on
the
side
of
bredon
hill
about
a
third
part
up
it
and
is
a
very
delightful
place
the
house
is
of
ancient
date
and
it
appears
to
have
been
always
inhabited
by
and
the
property
of
roman
catholics
for
there
is
in
one
corner
of
the
very
top
of
the
building
up
in
the
very
roof
of
it
a
catholic
chapel
as
ancient
as
the
roof
itself
it
is
about
feet
long
and
ten
wide
it
has
to
imitate
the
roof
of
a
church
at
the
back
of
the
altar
there
is
a
little
room
which
you
enter
through
a
door
going
out
of
the
chapel
and
adjoining
this
little
room
there
is
a
closet
in
which
is
a
trapdoor
made
to
let
the
priests
down
into
one
of
those
hiding
places
which
were
contrived
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
grasp
of
those
greedy
scotch
minions
to
whom
that
pious
and
tolerant
protestant
james
delivered
over
those
english
gentlemen
who
remained
faithful
to
the
religion
of
their
fathers
and
to
set
his
country
free
from
which
greedy
and
cruel
grasp
that
honest
englishman
guy
fawkes
wished
as
he
bravely
told
the
king
and
his
scotch
council
blow
the
scotch
beggars
back
to
their
mountains
even
this
king
has
in
his
works
for
james
was
an
author
had
the
justice
to
call
him
the
english
scævola
and
we
englishmen
fools
set
on
by
knaves
have
the
folly
or
the
baseness
to
burn
him
in
effigy
on
the
november
the
anniversary
of
his
intended
exploit
in
the
hall
of
this
house
there
is
the
portrait
of
sir
thomas
winter
who
was
one
of
the
accomplices
of
fawkes
and
who
was
killed
in
the
fight
with
the
sheriff
and
his
party
there
is
also
the
portrait
of
his
lady
who
must
have
spent
half
her
in
the
working
of
some
very
curious
sacerdotal
vestments
which
are
preserved
here
with
great
care
and
are
as
fresh
and
as
beautiful
as
they
were
the
day
they
were
finished
a
parson
said
to
me
once
by
letter
your
religion
cobbett
seems
to
me
to
be
altogether
very
much
so
indeed
answered
i
and
well
it
may
since
i
have
been
furnished
with
a
creed
which
makes
part
of
an
act
of
parliament
and
the
fact
is
i
am
no
doctor
of
divinity
and
like
a
religion
any
religion
that
tends
to
make
men
innocent
and
benevolent
and
happy
by
taking
the
best
possible
means
of
furnishing
them
with
plenty
to
eat
and
drink
and
wear
i
am
a
protestant
of
the
church
of
england
and
as
such
blush
to
see
that
more
than
half
the
are
wholly
gone
or
are
become
mere
hovels
what
i
have
written
on
the
protestant
reformation
has
proceeded
entirely
from
a
sense
of
justice
towards
our
calumniated
catholic
forefathers
to
whom
we
owe
all
those
of
our
institutions
that
are
worthy
of
our
admiration
and
gratitude
i
have
not
written
as
a
catholic
but
as
an
englishman
yet
a
sincere
catholic
must
feel
some
little
gratitude
towards
me
and
if
there
was
an
ungrateful
reptile
in
the
neighbourhood
of
preston
to
give
as
a
toast
success
to
stanley
and
wood
the
conduct
of
those
catholics
that
i
have
seen
here
has
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
amply
compensated
for
his
baseness
this
neighbourhood
has
witnessed
some
pretty
thumping
transfers
from
the
normans
holland
one
of
baring
partners
or
clerks
has
recently
bought
an
estate
of
lord
somers
called
dumbleton
for
it
is
said
about
eighty
thousand
pounds
another
estate
of
the
same
lord
called
strensham
has
been
bought
by
a
brummigeham
banker
of
the
name
of
taylor
for
it
is
said
seventy
thousand
pounds
eastnor
castle
just
over
the
malvern
hills
is
still
building
and
lord
eastnor
lives
at
that
pretty
little
warm
and
snug
place
the
priory
of
reigate
in
surrey
and
close
by
the
not
less
snug
little
borough
of
the
same
name
memorandum
when
we
were
petitioning
in
my
lord
somers
wrote
and
published
a
pamphlet
under
his
own
name
condemning
our
conduct
and
our
principles
and
insisting
that
we
if
let
alone
should
produce
and
all
the
barings
are
adding
field
to
field
and
tract
to
tract
in
herefordshire
and
as
to
the
ricardos
they
seem
to
be
animated
with
the
same
laudable
spirit
this
osmond
ricardo
has
a
park
at
one
of
his
estates
called
broomsborough
and
that
park
has
a
new
porter
lodge
upon
which
there
is
a
span
new
cross
as
large
as
life
aye
big
enough
and
long
enough
to
crucify
a
man
upon
i
had
never
seen
such
an
one
before
and
i
know
not
what
sort
of
thought
it
was
that
seized
me
at
the
moment
but
though
my
horse
is
but
a
clumsy
goer
i
verily
believe
i
got
away
from
it
at
the
rate
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
an
hour
my
companion
who
is
always
upon
the
for
or
pieces
of
timber
on
the
to
fill
up
the
time
of
which
my
gives
him
so
wearisome
a
surplus
seemed
delighted
at
this
my
new
pace
and
i
dare
say
he
has
wondered
ever
since
what
should
have
given
me
wings
just
for
that
once
and
that
once
only
tuesday
price
rode
with
us
to
this
city
which
is
one
of
the
cleanest
neatest
and
handsomest
towns
i
ever
saw
indeed
i
do
not
recollect
to
have
seen
any
one
equal
to
it
the
is
indeed
a
poor
thing
compared
with
any
of
the
others
except
that
of
hereford
and
i
have
seen
them
all
but
those
of
carlisle
durham
york
lincoln
chester
and
peterborough
but
the
is
i
think
the
very
best
i
ever
saw
and
which
is
indeed
the
greatest
of
all
recommendations
the
are
upon
the
whole
the
most
suitably
dressed
and
most
decent
looking
people
the
town
is
precisely
in
character
with
the
beautiful
and
rich
country
in
the
midst
of
which
it
lies
everything
you
see
gives
you
the
idea
of
real
solid
wealth
aye
and
thus
it
was
too
before
long
before
pitt
and
even
long
before
good
queen
bess
and
her
military
law
and
her
protestant
racks
were
ever
heard
or
dreamed
of
at
worcester
as
everywhere
else
i
find
a
group
of
cordial
and
sensible
friends
at
the
house
of
one
of
whom
george
brooke
i
have
just
spent
a
most
pleasant
evening
in
company
with
several
gentlemen
whom
he
had
had
the
goodness
to
invite
to
meet
me
i
here
learned
a
fact
which
i
must
put
upon
record
before
it
escape
my
memory
some
few
years
ago
about
seven
perhaps
at
the
public
sale
by
auction
of
the
goods
of
a
then
recently
deceased
attorney
of
the
name
of
hyde
in
this
city
there
were
amongst
the
goods
to
be
sold
the
portraits
of
and
all
framed
and
glazed
pitt
with
hard
driving
and
very
lofty
praises
fetched
fifteen
shillings
burdett
fetched
shillings
paine
was
in
great
haste
knocked
down
at
five
pounds
and
my
informant
was
convinced
that
the
lucky
purchaser
might
have
had
fifteen
pounds
for
it
i
hear
colonel
davies
spoken
of
here
with
great
approbation
he
will
soon
have
an
opportunity
of
showing
us
whether
he
deserve
it
the
and
bagging
is
over
here
the
crop
as
in
the
other
has
been
very
great
and
the
quality
as
good
as
ever
was
known
the
average
price
appears
to
be
about
the
hundred
weight
the
reader
if
he
do
not
belong
to
a
should
be
told
that
and
even
all
their
neighbours
are
as
though
the
most
sane
and
reasonable
people
as
to
all
other
matters
they
are
ten
times
more
jealous
upon
this
score
than
men
ever
are
of
their
wives
aye
and
than
they
are
of
their
mistresses
which
is
going
a
great
deal
farther
i
who
am
a
man
was
well
aware
of
this
foible
and
therefore
when
a
gentleman
told
me
that
he
would
not
brew
with
farnham
hops
if
he
could
have
them
as
a
gift
i
took
special
care
not
to
ask
him
how
it
came
to
pass
that
the
farnham
hops
always
sold
at
about
double
the
price
of
the
worcester
but
if
he
had
said
the
same
thing
to
any
other
farnham
man
that
i
ever
saw
i
should
have
preferred
being
absent
from
the
spot
the
hops
are
bitter
but
nothing
is
their
bitterness
compared
to
the
language
that
my
townsman
would
have
put
forth
this
city
or
this
neighbourhood
at
least
being
the
of
what
i
have
called
the
project
and
atwood
and
spooner
being
the
originators
of
the
project
and
the
project
having
been
adopted
by
western
and
having
been
by
him
now
again
recently
urged
upon
the
ministers
in
a
letter
to
lord
liverpool
and
it
being
possible
that
some
worthy
persons
may
be
misled
and
even
ruined
by
the
confident
assertions
and
the
pertinacity
of
the
projectors
this
being
the
case
and
i
having
half
an
hour
to
spare
will
here
endeavour
to
show
in
as
few
words
as
i
can
that
this
project
if
put
into
execution
would
produce
injustice
the
most
crying
that
the
world
ever
heard
of
and
would
in
the
present
state
of
things
infallibly
lead
to
a
violent
revolution
the
project
is
to
lower
the
standard
as
they
call
it
that
is
to
say
to
make
a
pass
for
more
than
in
what
they
would
reduce
the
standard
they
do
not
say
but
a
vile
pamphlet
writer
whose
name
is
crutwell
and
who
is
a
beneficed
parson
and
who
has
most
foully
abused
me
because
i
laugh
at
the
project
says
that
he
would
reduce
it
one
half
that
is
to
say
that
he
would
make
a
sovereign
pass
for
two
pounds
well
then
let
us
for
plainness
sake
suppose
that
the
present
sovereign
is
all
at
once
to
pass
for
two
pounds
what
will
the
consequences
be
why
here
is
a
parson
who
receives
his
tithes
in
kind
and
whose
tithes
are
we
will
suppose
a
thousand
bushels
of
wheat
in
a
year
on
an
average
and
he
owes
a
thousand
pounds
to
somebody
he
will
pay
his
debt
with
sovereigns
and
he
will
still
receive
his
thousand
bushels
of
wheat
a
year
i
let
a
farm
for
a
year
by
the
year
and
i
have
a
mortgage
of
upon
it
the
interest
just
taking
away
the
rent
pass
the
project
and
then
i
of
course
raise
my
rent
to
a
year
and
i
still
pay
the
mortgagee
a
year
what
can
be
plainer
than
this
but
the
banker
is
the
fine
case
i
deposit
with
a
banker
a
thousand
whole
sovereigns
pass
the
project
and
the
banker
pays
me
my
deposit
with
a
thousand
half
sovereigns
if
indeed
you
could
double
the
quantity
of
corn
and
meat
and
all
goods
by
the
same
act
of
parliament
then
all
would
be
right
but
that
quantity
will
remain
what
it
was
before
you
passed
the
project
and
of
course
the
money
being
doubled
in
nominal
amount
the
price
of
the
goods
would
be
doubled
there
needs
not
another
word
upon
the
subject
and
whatever
may
be
the
national
inference
respecting
the
intellects
of
atwood
and
spooner
i
must
say
that
i
do
most
sincerely
believe
that
there
is
not
one
of
my
readers
who
will
not
feel
astonishment
that
any
men
having
the
reputation
of
men
of
sound
mind
should
not
clearly
see
that
such
a
project
must
almost
instantly
produce
a
revolution
of
the
most
dreadful
character
park
wednesday
morning
in
a
letter
which
i
received
from
sir
thomas
winnington
one
of
the
members
for
this
county
last
year
he
was
good
enough
to
request
that
i
would
call
upon
him
if
i
ever
came
into
worcestershire
which
i
told
him
i
would
do
and
accordingly
here
we
are
in
his
house
situated
certainly
in
one
of
the
finest
spots
in
all
england
we
left
worcester
yesterday
about
ten
crossed
the
severn
which
runs
close
by
the
town
and
came
on
to
this
place
which
lies
in
a
direction
from
worcester
at
miles
distance
from
that
city
and
at
about
six
from
the
borders
of
shropshire
about
four
miles
back
we
passed
by
the
park
and
through
the
estate
of
lord
foley
to
whom
is
due
the
praise
of
being
a
most
indefatigable
and
successful
of
he
seems
to
have
taken
uncommon
pains
in
the
execution
of
this
work
and
he
has
the
merit
of
disinterestedness
the
trees
being
chiefly
oaks
which
he
is
he
can
never
see
grow
to
timber
we
crossed
the
teme
river
just
before
we
got
here
sir
thomas
was
out
shooting
but
he
soon
came
home
and
gave
us
a
very
polite
reception
i
had
time
yesterday
to
see
the
place
to
look
at
trees
and
the
like
and
i
wished
to
get
away
early
this
morning
but
being
prevailed
on
to
stay
to
breakfast
here
i
am
at
six
in
the
morning
in
one
of
the
best
and
private
libraries
that
i
ever
saw
and
what
is
more
the
owner
from
what
passed
yesterday
when
he
brought
me
hither
convinced
me
that
he
was
acquainted
with
the
of
the
books
i
asked
and
shall
ask
no
questions
about
who
got
these
books
together
but
the
collection
is
such
as
i
am
sure
i
never
saw
before
in
a
private
house
the
house
and
stables
and
courts
are
such
as
they
ought
to
be
for
the
great
estate
that
surrounds
them
and
the
park
is
everything
that
is
beautiful
on
one
side
of
the
house
looking
over
a
fine
piece
of
water
you
see
a
distant
valley
opening
between
lofty
hills
on
another
side
the
ground
descends
a
little
at
first
then
goes
gently
rising
for
a
while
and
then
rapidly
to
the
distance
of
a
mile
perhaps
where
it
is
crowned
with
trees
in
irregular
patches
or
groups
single
and
most
magnificent
trees
being
scattered
all
over
the
whole
of
the
park
on
another
side
there
rise
up
beautiful
little
hills
some
in
the
form
of
barrows
on
the
downs
only
forty
or
a
hundred
times
as
large
one
or
two
with
no
trees
on
them
and
others
topped
with
trees
but
on
one
of
these
little
hills
and
some
yards
higher
than
the
lofty
trees
which
are
on
this
little
hill
you
see
rising
up
the
tower
of
the
parish
church
which
hill
is
i
think
taken
all
together
amongst
the
most
delightful
objects
that
i
ever
beheld
well
then
says
the
devil
of
laziness
and
could
you
not
be
contented
to
live
here
all
the
rest
of
your
life
and
never
again
pester
yourself
with
the
cursed
politics
why
i
think
i
have
laboured
enough
let
others
work
now
and
such
a
pretty
place
for
coursing
and
for
and
woodcock
shooting
i
dare
say
and
then
those
pretty
in
the
water
and
the
flowers
and
the
grass
and
the
trees
and
all
the
birds
in
spring
and
the
fresh
air
and
never
never
again
to
be
stifled
with
the
smoke
that
from
the
infernal
wen
ascendeth
for
ever
more
and
that
every
easterly
wind
brings
to
choke
me
at
kensington
the
of
this
soliloquy
carried
me
back
slap
to
my
own
study
very
much
unlike
that
which
i
am
in
and
bade
me
think
of
the
gridiron
bade
me
think
of
the
complete
triumph
that
i
have
yet
to
enjoy
promised
me
the
pleasure
of
seeing
a
million
of
trees
of
my
own
and
sown
by
my
own
hands
this
very
year
ah
but
the
hares
and
the
pheasants
and
the
wild
ducks
yes
but
the
delight
of
seeing
prosperity
robinson
hang
his
head
for
shame
the
delight
of
beholding
the
tormenting
embarrassments
of
those
who
have
so
long
retained
crowds
of
base
miscreants
to
revile
me
the
delight
of
ousting
stanley
and
wood
yes
but
then
the
flowers
and
the
birds
and
the
sweet
air
what
then
shall
canning
never
again
hear
of
the
revered
and
ruptured
ogden
shall
he
go
into
his
grave
without
being
again
reminded
of
driving
at
the
whole
herd
in
order
to
get
at
the
shall
he
never
again
be
told
of
and
of
his
wish
to
extinguish
that
torch
of
discord
for
oh
god
forbid
farewell
hares
and
dogs
and
birds
what
shall
sidmouth
then
never
again
hear
of
his
of
imprisonment
of
his
of
his
of
thanks
to
the
manchester
i
really
jumped
up
when
this
thought
came
athwart
my
mind
and
without
thinking
of
the
breakfast
said
to
george
who
was
sitting
by
me
go
george
and
tell
them
to
saddle
the
horses
for
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
had
been
meditating
some
crime
upon
george
asking
me
whether
i
would
not
stop
to
breakfast
i
bade
him
not
order
the
horses
out
yet
and
here
we
are
waiting
for
breakfast
wednesday
night
after
breakfast
we
took
our
leave
of
sir
thomas
winnington
and
of
stanford
very
much
pleased
with
our
visit
we
wished
to
reach
ryall
as
early
as
possible
in
the
day
and
we
did
not
therefore
stop
at
worcester
we
got
here
about
three
and
we
intend
to
set
off
in
another
direction
early
in
the
morning
ride
from
ryall
in
worcestershire
to
burghclere
in
hampshire
alas
the
country
how
shall
tongue
or
pen
bewail
her
now
gentlemen
the
last
to
bid
the
cry
of
warfare
cease
the
first
to
make
a
malady
of
peace
for
what
were
all
these
country
patriots
born
to
hunt
and
vote
and
raise
the
price
of
corn
but
corn
like
mortal
thing
must
fall
kings
conquerors
and
most
of
lord
byron
friday
morning
september
i
have
observed
in
this
country
and
especially
near
worcester
that
the
working
people
seem
to
be
better
off
than
in
many
other
parts
one
cause
of
which
is
i
dare
say
that
which
can
not
be
carried
on
by
fire
or
by
wind
or
by
water
and
which
is
therefore
carried
on
by
the
of
human
beings
it
gives
work
to
women
and
children
as
well
as
to
men
and
that
work
is
by
a
great
part
of
the
women
and
children
done
in
their
cottages
and
amidst
the
fields
and
where
the
husbands
and
sons
must
live
in
order
to
raise
the
food
and
the
drink
and
the
wool
this
is
a
great
thing
for
the
land
if
this
were
to
cease
many
of
these
women
and
children
now
not
upon
the
parish
must
instantly
be
upon
the
parish
the
is
like
all
others
slack
from
this
last
change
in
the
value
of
money
but
there
is
no
horrible
misery
here
as
at
manchester
leeds
glasgow
paisley
and
other
of
degrees
of
heat
there
misery
walks
abroad
in
skin
bone
and
nakedness
there
are
no
subscriptions
wanted
for
worcester
no
the
working
people
suffer
suffer
and
who
is
to
escape
except
the
monopolizers
the
jews
and
the
when
the
government
chooses
to
raise
the
value
of
money
and
lower
the
price
of
goods
the
whole
of
the
industrious
part
of
the
country
must
suffer
in
such
a
case
but
where
manufacturing
is
mixed
with
agriculture
where
the
wife
and
daughters
are
at
the
needle
or
the
wheel
while
the
men
and
the
boys
are
at
plough
and
where
the
manufacturing
of
which
one
or
two
towns
are
the
centres
is
spread
over
the
whole
country
round
about
and
particularly
where
it
is
in
very
great
part
performed
by
females
at
their
and
where
the
earnings
come
aid
of
the
in
such
case
the
misery
can
not
be
so
great
and
accordingly
while
there
is
an
absolute
destruction
of
life
going
on
in
the
there
is
no
misery
at
or
near
worcester
and
i
can
not
take
my
leave
of
this
county
without
observing
that
i
do
not
recollect
to
have
seen
one
miserable
object
in
it
the
working
people
all
seem
to
have
good
large
gardens
and
pigs
in
their
styes
and
this
last
say
the
what
they
will
about
her
antallectual
enjoyments
is
the
security
for
happiness
in
a
family
then
this
is
not
like
that
of
cottons
a
mere
gambling
concern
making
baronets
and
bankrupts
and
making
those
who
do
the
work
slaves
here
are
no
masses
of
people
called
together
by
a
and
kept
by
a
driver
here
are
no
patriots
who
while
they
keep
englishmen
to
it
by
fines
and
almost
by
the
scourge
in
a
heat
of
degrees
are
petitioning
the
parliament
to
give
freedom
to
the
south
americans
who
as
these
patriots
have
been
informed
use
a
great
quantity
of
the
dilapidation
of
and
the
depopulation
of
villages
appears
not
to
have
been
so
great
just
round
about
worcester
as
in
some
other
parts
but
they
have
made
great
progress
even
here
no
man
appears
to
fat
an
ox
or
hardly
a
sheep
except
with
a
view
of
sending
it
to
london
or
to
some
other
infernal
resort
of
monopolizers
and
here
as
in
wiltshire
and
gloucestershire
and
herefordshire
you
find
plenty
of
large
churches
without
scarcely
any
people
i
dare
say
that
even
in
this
county
more
than
one
half
of
the
parishes
have
either
no
at
all
or
have
not
one
that
a
parson
thinks
fit
for
him
to
live
in
and
i
venture
to
assert
that
one
or
the
other
of
these
is
the
case
in
four
parishes
out
of
every
five
in
herefordshire
is
not
this
a
monstrous
shame
is
this
a
church
is
this
law
the
parsons
get
the
tithes
and
the
rent
of
the
and
the
are
left
to
tumble
down
and
nettles
and
brambles
to
hide
the
spot
where
they
stood
but
the
fact
is
the
has
swept
all
the
little
gentry
the
small
farmers
and
the
domestic
manufacturers
away
the
land
is
now
used
to
raise
food
and
drink
for
the
monopolizers
and
the
and
their
purveyors
and
lackeys
and
harlots
and
they
get
together
in
wens
of
all
the
mean
all
the
cowardly
reptiles
that
ever
crawled
on
the
face
of
the
earth
the
are
the
most
mean
and
the
most
cowardly
for
while
they
support
the
churches
in
their
several
parishes
while
they
see
the
population
drawn
away
from
their
parishes
to
the
wens
while
they
are
taxed
to
keep
the
people
in
the
wens
and
while
they
see
their
own
parsons
pocket
the
tithes
and
the
and
suffer
the
to
fall
down
while
they
see
all
this
they
without
uttering
a
word
in
the
way
of
complaint
suffer
themselves
and
their
neighbours
to
be
taxed
to
build
new
churches
for
the
monopolizers
and
in
those
wens
never
was
there
in
this
world
a
set
of
reptiles
so
base
as
this
stupid
as
many
of
them
are
they
must
clearly
see
the
flagrant
injustice
of
making
the
depopulated
parishes
pay
for
the
aggrandizement
of
those
who
have
caused
the
depopulation
aye
actually
pay
taxes
add
the
wens
and
of
course
to
cause
a
further
depopulation
of
the
taxed
villages
stupid
beasts
as
many
of
them
are
they
must
see
the
flagrant
injustice
of
this
and
mean
and
cowardly
as
many
of
them
are
some
of
them
would
remonstrate
against
it
but
alas
the
far
greater
part
of
them
are
themselves
getting
or
expecting
and
either
in
their
own
persons
or
in
those
of
their
family
they
smouch
or
want
to
smouch
some
of
the
taxes
and
therefore
they
must
not
complain
and
thus
the
thing
goes
on
these
landowners
see
too
the
churches
falling
down
and
the
either
tumbled
down
or
dilapidated
but
then
mind
they
have
amongst
them
the
giving
away
of
the
benefices
of
course
all
they
want
is
the
income
and
the
less
the
costs
the
larger
the
spending
income
but
in
the
meanwhile
here
is
a
destruction
of
public
property
and
also
from
a
diversion
of
the
income
of
the
livings
a
great
injury
great
injustice
to
the
middle
and
the
working
classes
is
this
then
is
this
church
a
thing
to
remain
untouched
shall
the
widow
and
the
orphan
whose
money
has
been
borrowed
the
including
the
parsons
to
purchase
victories
with
shall
they
be
stripped
of
their
interest
of
their
very
bread
and
shall
the
parsons
who
have
let
half
the
fall
down
or
become
unfit
to
live
in
still
keep
all
the
tithes
and
the
and
the
immense
landed
estates
called
church
lands
oh
no
sir
james
graham
of
netherby
though
you
are
a
descendant
of
the
earls
of
monteith
of
john
of
the
bright
sword
and
of
the
seventh
earl
of
galloway
taking
care
for
god
sake
not
to
omit
the
though
you
may
be
the
and
in
short
be
you
what
you
may
you
shall
never
execute
your
project
of
sponging
the
and
of
leaving
messieurs
the
parsons
untouched
in
many
parishes
where
the
livings
are
good
too
there
is
neither
nor
church
this
is
the
case
at
draycot
foliot
in
wiltshire
the
living
is
a
rectory
the
parson
has
of
course
both
great
and
small
tithes
these
tithes
and
the
are
worth
i
am
told
more
than
three
hundred
pounds
a
year
and
yet
there
is
neither
church
nor
both
have
been
suffered
to
fall
down
and
disappear
and
when
a
new
parson
comes
to
take
possession
of
the
living
there
is
i
am
told
a
temporary
tent
or
booth
erected
upon
the
spot
where
the
church
ought
to
be
for
the
performance
of
the
of
what
then
ought
not
this
church
to
be
repealed
an
act
of
parliament
made
this
church
an
act
of
parliament
can
unmake
it
and
is
there
any
but
a
monster
who
would
suffer
this
parson
to
retain
this
income
while
that
of
the
widow
and
the
orphan
was
taken
away
oh
no
sir
james
graham
of
netherby
who
with
the
before
say
that
there
was
no
man
of
any
authority
who
foresaw
the
effects
of
peel
bill
oh
no
thou
stupid
thou
thou
insolent
aristocratic
pamphleteer
the
widow
and
the
orphan
be
robbed
of
their
bread
while
this
parson
of
draycot
foliot
keeps
the
income
of
his
living
on
my
return
from
worcester
to
this
place
yesterday
i
noticed
at
a
village
called
severn
stoke
a
very
grape
house
that
is
to
say
a
for
the
raising
of
grapes
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
it
belonged
to
a
parson
of
the
name
of
john
whose
parsonage
house
is
very
near
to
it
and
who
being
of
having
the
benefice
when
the
then
rector
should
die
bought
a
piece
of
land
and
erected
his
grapery
on
it
just
facing
and
only
about
yards
from
the
windows
out
of
which
the
had
to
look
until
the
day
of
his
death
with
a
view
doubtless
of
piously
furnishing
his
aged
brother
with
a
remember
death
quite
as
significant
as
a
death
head
and
and
yet
done
in
a
manner
expressive
of
that
that
delicacy
that
abstinence
from
which
are
well
known
to
be
characteristics
almost
peculiar
to
the
cloth
to
those
if
there
be
such
who
may
be
disposed
to
suspect
that
the
grapery
arose
upon
the
spot
where
it
stands
merely
from
the
desire
to
have
the
vines
in
bearing
state
against
the
time
that
the
old
parson
should
die
or
as
i
heard
the
botley
parson
once
call
it
kick
the
bucket
to
such
persons
i
would
just
put
this
one
question
did
they
ever
either
from
scripture
or
tradition
learn
that
any
of
the
apostles
or
their
disciples
erected
graperies
from
motives
such
as
this
they
may
indeed
say
that
they
never
heard
of
the
apostles
erecting
any
graperies
at
all
much
less
of
their
having
erected
them
from
such
a
motive
nor
to
say
the
truth
did
i
ever
hear
of
any
such
erections
on
the
part
of
those
apostles
and
those
whom
they
commissioned
to
preach
the
word
of
god
and
sir
william
scott
now
a
of
some
sort
never
convinced
me
by
his
speech
of
that
to
give
the
a
due
degree
of
influence
over
the
minds
of
the
people
to
make
the
people
revere
them
it
was
necessary
that
the
parsons
and
their
wives
should
shine
at
and
in
on
the
contrary
these
and
the
like
have
taken
away
almost
the
whole
of
their
spiritual
influence
they
never
had
much
but
lately
and
especially
since
they
have
had
hardly
any
at
all
and
wherever
i
go
i
find
them
much
better
known
as
of
the
than
as
clergymen
what
they
would
come
to
if
this
system
could
go
on
for
only
a
few
years
longer
i
know
not
but
go
on
as
it
is
now
going
it
can
not
much
longer
there
must
be
settlement
of
some
and
that
settlement
never
can
leave
that
mass
that
immense
mass
of
public
property
called
church
property
to
be
used
as
it
now
is
i
have
seen
in
this
country
and
in
herefordshire
several
pieces
of
mangel
wurzel
and
i
hear
that
it
has
nowhere
failed
as
the
turnips
have
even
the
lucerne
has
in
some
places
failed
to
a
certain
extent
but
walter
palmer
at
pencoyd
in
herefordshire
has
cut
a
piece
of
lucerne
four
times
this
last
summer
and
when
i
saw
it
on
the
days
ago
it
was
got
a
foot
high
towards
another
cut
but
with
one
exception
too
trifling
to
mention
walter
lucerne
is
on
the
tullian
plan
that
is
it
is
in
rows
at
four
feet
distance
from
each
other
so
that
you
plough
between
as
often
as
you
please
and
thus
together
with
a
little
hand
weeding
between
the
plants
keep
the
ground
at
all
times
clear
of
weeds
and
grass
palmer
says
that
his
acre
he
has
no
more
has
kept
two
horses
all
the
summer
and
he
seems
to
complain
that
it
has
done
no
more
indeed
a
stout
horse
will
eat
much
more
than
a
fatting
ox
this
grass
will
fat
any
ox
or
sheep
and
would
not
palmer
like
to
have
ten
acres
of
land
that
would
fat
a
score
of
oxen
they
would
do
this
if
they
were
managed
well
but
is
it
to
keep
a
team
of
four
horses
for
five
months
in
the
year
on
the
produce
of
two
acres
of
land
if
a
man
say
that
he
must
of
course
be
eagerly
looking
forward
to
another
world
for
nothing
will
satisfy
him
in
this
a
good
crop
of
early
cabbages
may
be
had
between
the
rows
of
lucerne
have
generally
wholly
failed
those
that
i
see
are
almost
all
too
backward
to
make
much
of
heads
though
it
is
surprising
how
fast
they
will
grow
and
come
to
perfection
as
soon
as
there
is
hours
of
i
am
here
however
speaking
of
the
large
sorts
of
cabbage
for
the
smaller
sorts
will
loave
in
summer
walter
palmer
has
now
a
piece
of
these
of
which
i
think
there
are
from
to
to
the
acre
and
this
too
observe
after
a
season
which
on
the
same
farm
has
not
suffered
a
turnip
of
any
sort
to
come
if
he
had
had
acres
of
these
he
might
have
almost
laughed
at
the
failure
of
his
turnips
and
at
the
short
crop
of
hay
and
this
is
a
crop
of
which
a
man
may
always
be
if
he
take
proper
pains
these
cabbages
early
yorks
or
some
such
sort
should
if
you
want
them
in
june
or
july
be
sown
early
in
the
previous
august
if
you
want
them
in
winter
sown
in
april
and
treated
as
pointed
out
in
my
these
small
sorts
stand
the
winter
better
than
the
large
they
are
more
nutritious
and
they
occupy
the
ground
little
more
than
half
the
time
are
the
finest
and
richest
and
most
nutritious
of
cabbages
sown
early
in
april
and
planted
out
early
in
july
they
will
at
inches
apart
each
way
yield
a
crop
of
to
tons
by
christmas
but
all
this
supposes
land
very
good
or
very
well
manured
and
plants
of
a
good
sort
and
well
raised
and
planted
and
the
ground
well
tilled
after
planting
and
a
crop
of
tons
is
worth
all
these
and
all
the
care
and
all
the
pains
that
a
man
can
possibly
take
i
am
here
amongst
the
finest
of
cattle
and
the
finest
sheep
of
the
leicester
kind
that
i
ever
saw
my
host
price
is
famed
as
a
breeder
of
cattle
and
sheep
the
cattle
are
of
the
hereford
kind
and
the
sheep
surpassing
any
animals
of
the
kind
that
i
ever
saw
the
animals
seem
to
be
made
for
the
soil
and
the
soil
for
them
in
taking
leave
of
this
county
i
repeat
with
great
satisfaction
what
i
before
said
about
the
apparent
comparatively
happy
state
of
the
labouring
people
and
i
have
been
very
much
pleased
with
the
tone
and
manner
in
which
they
are
spoken
to
and
spoken
of
by
their
superiors
i
hear
of
no
treatment
of
them
here
such
as
i
have
but
too
often
heard
of
in
some
counties
and
too
often
witnessed
in
others
and
i
quit
worcestershire
and
particularly
the
house
in
which
i
am
with
all
those
feelings
which
are
naturally
produced
by
the
kindest
of
receptions
from
frank
and
sensible
people
gloucestershire
saturday
morning
though
we
came
about
miles
yesterday
we
are
up
by
and
just
about
to
set
off
to
sleep
at
hayden
near
swindon
in
wiltshire
saturday
night
from
ryall
in
worcestershire
we
came
yesterday
friday
morning
first
to
tewksbury
in
gloucestershire
this
is
a
good
substantial
town
which
for
many
years
sent
to
parliament
that
sensible
and
honest
and
constant
hater
of
pitt
and
his
infernal
politics
james
martin
and
which
now
sends
to
the
same
place
his
son
john
martin
who
when
the
memorable
was
presented
in
june
proposed
that
it
should
not
be
received
or
that
if
it
were
received
the
house
should
not
separate
until
it
had
resolved
that
the
interest
of
the
debt
should
never
be
reduced
castlereagh
abused
the
petition
but
was
for
it
in
to
fix
on
it
a
mark
of
the
i
said
in
the
next
register
that
this
fellow
was
and
in
six
or
seven
weeks
from
that
day
he
cut
his
own
throat
and
was
declared
to
have
been
mad
at
the
time
when
this
petition
was
presented
the
mess
that
will
be
in
will
be
bad
enough
as
it
is
but
what
would
have
been
its
mess
if
it
had
in
its
strong
fit
of
good
faith
been
furious
enough
to
adopt
martin
resolution
the
warwickshire
avon
falls
into
the
severn
here
and
on
the
sides
of
both
for
many
miles
back
there
are
the
finest
meadows
that
ever
were
seen
in
looking
over
them
and
beholding
the
endless
flocks
and
herds
one
wonders
what
can
become
of
all
the
meat
by
riding
on
about
eight
or
nine
miles
farther
however
this
wonder
is
a
little
diminished
for
here
we
come
to
one
of
the
devouring
wens
namely
cheltenham
which
is
what
they
call
a
watering
place
that
is
to
say
a
place
to
which
east
india
plunderers
west
india
floggers
english
together
with
gluttons
drunkards
and
debauchees
of
all
descriptions
female
as
well
as
male
resort
at
the
suggestion
of
silently
laughing
quacks
in
the
hope
of
getting
rid
of
the
bodily
consequences
of
their
manifold
sins
and
iniquities
when
i
enter
a
place
like
this
i
always
feel
disposed
to
squeeze
up
my
nose
with
my
fingers
it
is
nonsense
to
be
sure
but
i
conceit
that
every
creature
that
i
see
coming
near
me
is
about
to
cover
me
with
the
poisonous
proceeds
of
its
impurities
to
places
like
this
come
all
that
is
knavish
and
all
that
is
foolish
and
all
that
is
base
gamesters
pickpockets
and
harlots
young
in
search
of
rich
and
ugly
and
old
women
and
young
in
search
of
rich
and
wrinkled
or
men
the
former
resolutely
bent
be
the
means
what
they
may
to
give
the
latter
heirs
to
their
lands
and
tenements
these
things
are
notorious
and
sir
william
scott
in
his
speech
of
in
favour
of
the
of
the
clergy
expressly
said
that
they
and
their
families
ought
to
appear
at
watering
places
and
that
this
was
amongst
the
means
of
making
them
respected
by
their
flocks
memorandum
he
was
a
member
for
oxford
when
he
said
this
before
we
got
into
cheltenham
i
learned
from
a
which
way
we
had
to
go
in
order
to
see
new
which
are
now
nearly
at
a
stand
we
rode
up
the
main
street
of
the
town
for
some
distance
and
then
turned
off
to
the
left
which
soon
brought
us
to
the
desolation
of
abomination
i
have
seldom
seen
anything
with
more
heartfelt
satisfaction
oh
said
i
to
myself
the
accursed
thing
has
certainly
got
a
then
in
every
part
of
its
corrupt
and
corrupting
carcass
the
whole
town
and
it
was
now
ten
looked
delightfully
dull
i
did
not
see
more
than
four
or
five
carriages
and
perhaps
twenty
people
on
and
these
seemed
by
their
and
round
eyes
and
by
the
long
and
sooty
necks
of
the
women
to
be
for
the
greater
part
and
the
place
really
appears
to
be
sinking
very
fast
and
i
have
been
told
and
believe
the
fact
that
houses
in
cheltenham
will
now
sell
for
only
just
about
as
much
as
the
same
would
have
sold
for
only
in
last
october
it
is
curious
to
see
the
names
which
the
vermin
owners
have
put
upon
the
houses
here
there
is
a
new
row
of
most
gaudy
and
fantastical
dwelling
places
called
colombia
place
given
it
doubtless
by
some
dealer
in
there
is
what
a
boy
told
us
was
the
there
is
oh
how
i
rejoice
at
the
ruin
of
the
base
creatures
there
is
and
the
good
of
it
is
that
the
ridiculous
beasts
have
put
this
word
upon
scores
of
houses
and
some
very
mean
and
shabby
houses
standing
along
and
making
part
of
an
unbroken
street
what
a
figure
this
place
will
cut
in
another
year
or
two
i
should
not
wonder
to
see
it
nearly
wholly
deserted
it
is
situated
in
a
nasty
flat
stupid
spot
without
anything
pleasant
near
it
a
putting
down
of
the
one
pound
notes
will
soon
take
away
its
those
of
the
notes
that
have
already
been
cut
off
have
it
seems
lessened
the
quantity
of
ailments
very
considerably
another
brush
will
cure
all
the
complaints
they
have
had
some
rains
in
the
summer
not
far
from
this
place
for
we
saw
in
the
streets
very
fine
turnips
for
sale
as
vegetables
and
broccoli
with
heads
six
or
eight
inches
over
but
as
to
the
meat
it
was
nothing
to
be
compared
with
that
of
warminster
in
wiltshire
that
is
to
say
the
veal
and
lamb
i
have
paid
particular
attention
to
this
matter
at
worcester
and
tewksbury
as
well
as
at
cheltenham
and
i
have
seen
no
veal
and
no
lamb
to
be
compared
with
those
of
warminster
i
have
been
thinking
but
can
not
imagine
how
it
is
that
the
either
at
bath
or
london
do
not
get
this
meat
away
from
warminster
i
hope
that
my
observations
on
it
will
not
set
them
to
work
for
if
it
do
the
people
of
warminster
will
never
have
a
bit
of
good
meat
again
after
cheltenham
we
had
to
reach
this
pretty
little
town
of
fairford
the
regular
turnpike
road
to
which
lay
through
cirencester
but
i
had
from
a
fine
map
at
sir
thomas
winnington
traced
out
a
line
for
us
along
through
a
chain
of
villages
leaving
cirencester
away
to
our
right
and
never
coming
nearer
than
seven
or
eight
miles
to
it
we
came
through
dodeswell
withington
chedworth
winston
and
the
two
colnes
at
dodeswell
we
came
up
a
long
and
steep
hill
which
brought
us
out
of
the
great
vale
of
gloucester
and
up
upon
the
cotswold
hills
which
name
is
tautological
i
believe
for
i
think
that
meaned
lands
of
great
such
is
the
cotswold
at
any
rate
for
it
is
a
tract
of
country
stretching
across
in
a
direction
from
dodeswell
to
near
fairford
and
in
a
direction
from
pitchcomb
hill
in
gloucestershire
which
remember
i
descended
on
the
september
to
near
witney
in
oxfordshire
here
we
were
then
when
we
got
fairly
up
upon
the
wold
with
the
vale
of
gloucester
at
our
back
oxford
and
its
vale
to
our
left
the
vale
of
wiltshire
to
our
right
and
the
vale
of
berkshire
in
our
front
and
from
one
particular
point
i
could
see
a
part
of
each
of
them
this
wold
is
in
itself
an
ugly
country
the
soil
is
what
is
called
a
below
with
a
reddish
earth
mixed
with
little
bits
of
this
brash
at
top
and
for
the
greater
part
of
the
wold
even
this
soil
is
very
shallow
and
as
fields
are
divided
by
walls
made
of
this
brash
and
as
there
are
for
a
mile
or
two
together
no
trees
to
be
seen
and
as
the
surface
is
not
smooth
and
green
like
the
downs
this
is
a
sort
of
country
having
less
to
please
the
eye
than
any
other
that
i
have
ever
seen
always
save
and
except
the
like
those
of
bagshot
and
hindhead
yet
even
this
wold
has
many
fertile
dells
in
it
and
sends
out
from
its
highest
parts
several
streams
each
of
which
has
its
pretty
valley
and
its
meadows
and
here
has
come
down
to
us
from
a
distance
of
many
centuries
a
particular
race
of
sheep
called
the
breed
which
are
of
course
the
best
suited
to
the
country
they
are
short
and
stocky
and
appear
to
me
to
be
about
half
way
in
point
of
size
between
the
rylands
and
the
south
downs
when
crossed
with
the
leicester
as
they
are
pretty
generally
in
the
north
of
wiltshire
they
make
very
beautiful
and
even
large
sheep
quite
large
enough
and
people
say
very
profitable
a
when
it
lies
through
is
one
thing
on
a
and
quite
another
thing
on
the
ground
our
line
of
villages
from
cheltenham
to
fairford
was
very
nearly
straight
upon
the
map
but
upon
the
ground
it
took
us
round
about
a
great
many
miles
besides
now
and
then
a
little
going
back
to
get
into
the
right
road
and
which
was
a
great
inconvenience
not
a
was
there
on
our
road
until
we
got
within
eight
miles
of
fairford
resolved
that
not
one
single
farthing
of
my
money
should
be
spent
in
the
wen
of
cheltenham
we
came
through
that
place
expecting
to
find
a
in
the
first
or
second
of
the
villages
but
not
one
was
there
over
the
whole
of
the
wold
and
though
i
had
by
pocketing
some
slices
of
meat
and
bread
at
ryall
provided
against
this
contingency
as
far
as
related
to
ourselves
i
could
make
no
such
provision
for
our
horses
and
they
went
a
great
deal
too
far
without
baiting
plenty
of
and
if
they
had
been
in
america
we
need
have
looked
for
no
other
very
likely
i
hope
it
at
any
rate
almost
any
farmer
on
the
cotswold
would
have
given
us
what
we
wanted
if
we
had
asked
for
it
but
the
fashion
the
good
old
fashion
was
by
the
hellish
system
of
funding
and
taxing
and
monopolizing
driven
across
the
atlantic
and
is
england
to
see
it
return
is
the
hellish
system
to
last
doctor
black
in
remarking
upon
my
ride
down
the
vale
of
the
salisbury
avon
says
that
there
has
doubtless
been
a
falling
off
in
the
population
of
the
villages
lying
amongst
the
aye
and
lying
everywhere
else
too
or
how
comes
it
that
of
the
parishes
of
herefordshire
abounding
in
rich
land
in
meadows
orchards
and
pastures
have
either
no
at
all
or
have
none
that
a
parson
thinks
fit
for
him
to
live
in
i
vouch
for
the
fact
i
will
whether
in
parliament
or
not
prove
the
fact
to
the
parliament
and
if
the
fact
be
such
the
conclusion
is
inevitable
but
how
melancholy
is
the
sight
of
these
decayed
and
still
decaying
villages
in
the
dells
of
the
cotswold
where
the
building
materials
being
stone
the
ruins
do
not
totally
disappear
for
ages
the
village
of
withington
mentioned
above
has
a
church
like
a
small
cathedral
and
the
whole
of
the
population
is
now
only
persons
men
women
and
children
so
that
according
to
the
scotch
fellows
this
immense
and
fine
church
which
is
as
sound
as
it
was
or
years
ago
was
built
by
and
for
a
population
containing
at
most
only
about
grown
up
and
men
but
here
in
this
once
populous
village
or
i
think
town
you
see
the
indubitable
marks
of
most
melancholy
decay
there
are
several
lanes
crossing
each
other
which
have
been
formerly
there
is
a
large
open
space
where
the
principal
streets
meet
there
are
against
this
open
place
two
large
old
roomy
houses
with
gateways
into
back
parts
of
them
and
with
large
stone
against
the
walls
of
them
in
the
street
these
were
manifestly
considerable
and
in
this
open
place
markets
or
fairs
or
both
used
to
be
held
i
asked
two
men
who
were
threshing
in
a
barn
how
long
it
was
since
their
was
put
down
or
dropped
they
told
me
about
sixteen
years
one
of
these
men
who
was
about
fifty
years
of
age
could
remember
one
of
which
was
what
was
called
an
the
place
stands
by
the
side
of
a
little
brook
which
here
rises
or
rather
issues
from
a
high
hill
and
which
when
it
has
winded
down
for
some
miles
and
through
several
villages
begins
to
be
called
the
river
colne
and
continues
on
under
this
name
through
fairford
and
along
i
suppose
till
it
falls
into
the
thames
withington
is
very
prettily
situated
it
was
and
not
very
long
ago
a
gay
and
nappy
place
but
it
now
presents
a
picture
of
dilapidation
and
shabbiness
scarcely
to
be
equalled
here
are
the
yet
visible
remains
of
two
gentlemen
houses
great
farmers
have
supplied
their
place
as
to
inhabiting
and
i
dare
say
that
some
or
some
blaspheming
jew
or
some
still
more
base
and
wicked
robber
is
now
the
owner
of
the
land
aye
and
all
these
people
are
his
as
completely
and
more
to
their
wrong
than
the
blacks
are
the
slaves
of
the
planters
in
jamaica
the
farmers
here
acting
in
fact
in
a
capacity
corresponding
with
that
of
the
there
a
part
and
perhaps
a
considerable
part
of
the
decay
and
misery
of
this
place
is
owing
to
the
use
of
and
to
the
in
the
manufacture
of
blankets
of
which
fabric
the
town
of
witney
above
mentioned
was
the
centre
and
from
which
town
the
wool
used
to
be
sent
round
to
and
the
yarn
or
warp
come
back
from
all
these
cotswold
villages
and
quite
into
a
part
of
wiltshire
this
work
is
all
now
gone
and
so
the
women
and
the
girls
are
a
surplus
and
are
of
course
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
emigration
committee
of
the
collective
wisdom
there
were
only
a
few
years
ago
above
thirty
at
witney
of
these
have
been
swallowed
up
by
the
five
that
now
have
all
the
manufacture
in
their
hands
and
all
this
has
been
done
by
that
system
of
gambling
and
of
fictitious
money
which
has
conveyed
property
from
the
hands
of
the
many
into
the
hands
of
the
few
but
wise
burdett
this
he
wants
the
land
to
be
cultivated
by
few
hands
and
he
wants
machinery
and
all
those
things
which
draw
money
into
that
make
a
nation
consist
of
a
few
of
very
rich
and
of
millions
of
very
poor
burdett
must
look
sharp
or
this
system
will
play
him
a
trick
before
it
come
to
an
end
the
crops
on
the
cotswold
have
been
pretty
good
and
i
was
very
much
surprised
to
see
a
scattering
of
early
turnips
and
in
some
places
decent
crops
upon
this
wold
i
saw
more
early
turnips
in
a
mile
or
two
than
i
saw
in
all
herefordshire
and
worcestershire
and
in
all
the
rich
and
low
part
of
gloucestershire
the
high
lands
always
during
the
year
and
especially
during
the
summer
receive
much
more
of
rain
than
the
low
lands
the
clouds
hang
about
the
hills
and
the
dews
when
they
rise
go
most
frequently
and
cap
the
hills
is
yet
going
on
on
the
wold
but
the
greater
part
of
it
is
sown
and
not
only
sown
but
up
and
in
some
places
high
enough
to
hide
a
hare
what
a
difference
in
some
parts
of
england
no
man
thinks
of
sowing
wheat
till
november
and
it
is
often
done
in
march
if
the
latter
were
done
on
this
wold
there
would
not
be
a
bushel
on
an
acre
the
ploughing
and
other
work
on
the
wold
is
done
in
great
part
by
oxen
and
here
are
some
of
the
finest
that
i
ever
saw
all
the
villages
down
to
fairford
are
pretty
much
in
the
same
dismal
condition
as
that
of
withington
fairford
which
is
quite
on
the
border
of
gloucestershire
is
a
very
pretty
little
and
has
one
of
the
prettiest
churches
in
the
kingdom
it
was
they
say
built
in
the
reign
of
henry
vii
and
one
is
naturally
surprised
to
see
that
its
windows
of
beautiful
stained
glass
had
the
luck
to
escape
not
only
the
fangs
of
the
ferocious
good
queen
bess
not
only
the
unsparing
plundering
minions
of
james
but
even
the
devastating
ruffians
of
cromwell
we
got
in
here
about
four
and
at
the
house
of
iles
where
we
slept
passed
amongst
several
friends
a
very
pleasant
evening
this
morning
iles
was
so
good
as
to
ride
with
us
as
far
as
the
house
of
another
friend
at
kempsford
which
is
the
last
gloucestershire
parish
in
our
route
at
this
friend
arkall
we
saw
a
fine
dairy
of
about
or
cows
and
a
cheese
loft
with
perhaps
more
than
two
thousand
cheeses
in
it
at
least
there
were
many
hundreds
this
village
contains
what
are
said
to
be
the
remnants
and
ruins
of
a
mansion
of
john
of
gaunt
the
church
is
very
ancient
and
very
capacious
what
tales
these
churches
do
tell
upon
us
what
fools
what
lazy
dogs
what
presumptuous
asses
what
lying
braggarts
they
make
us
appear
no
people
here
teel
the
scots
cam
to
us
impudent
lying
beggars
their
stinking
ought
to
be
taken
up
and
the
brazen
and
insolent
vagabonds
whipped
back
to
their
heaths
and
their
rocks
let
them
go
and
thrive
by
their
and
let
their
poet
walter
scott
immortalize
their
deeds
that
conceited
dunderheaded
fellow
george
chalmers
the
whole
of
the
population
of
england
and
wales
at
a
few
persons
more
than
when
england
was
just
at
the
highest
point
of
her
power
and
glory
and
when
all
these
churches
had
long
been
built
and
were
resounding
with
the
voice
of
priests
who
resided
in
their
parishes
and
who
relieved
all
the
poor
out
of
their
tithes
but
this
same
chalmers
signed
his
that
vortigern
and
the
other
which
were
written
by
a
lad
of
sixteen
were
written
by
shakspeare
in
coming
to
kempsford
we
got
wet
and
nearly
to
the
skin
but
our
friends
gave
us
coats
to
put
on
while
ours
were
dried
and
while
we
ate
our
breakfast
in
our
way
to
this
house
where
we
now
are
tucky
at
heydon
we
called
at
james
crowdy
at
highworth
where
i
was
from
the
to
the
of
september
inclusive
but
it
looked
rainy
and
therefore
we
did
not
alight
we
got
wet
again
before
we
reached
this
place
but
our
journey
being
short
we
soon
got
our
clothes
dry
again
hampshire
monday
yesterday
was
a
really
the
morning
promised
fair
but
its
promises
were
like
those
of
burdett
there
was
a
little
snivelling
wet
treacherous
frost
we
had
to
come
through
swindon
and
tucky
had
the
kindness
to
come
with
us
until
we
got
three
or
four
miles
on
this
side
the
hungerford
side
of
that
very
neat
and
plain
and
solid
and
respectable
market
town
swindon
is
in
wiltshire
and
is
in
the
real
fat
of
the
land
all
being
wheat
beans
cheese
or
fat
meat
in
our
way
to
swindon
tucky
farm
exhibited
to
me
what
i
never
saw
before
four
score
oxen
all
grazing
upon
one
farm
and
all
nearly
fat
they
were
some
devonshire
and
some
herefordshire
they
were
fatting
on
the
grass
only
and
i
should
suppose
that
they
are
worth
or
shortly
will
be
thirty
pounds
each
but
the
great
pleasure
with
which
the
contemplation
of
this
fine
sight
was
naturally
calculated
to
inspire
me
was
more
than
counterbalanced
by
the
thought
that
these
fine
oxen
this
primest
of
human
food
was
aye
every
mouthful
of
it
destined
to
be
devoured
in
the
wen
and
that
too
for
the
far
greater
part
by
the
jews
and
their
base
and
prostituted
followers
dependents
purveyors
parasites
and
pimps
literary
as
well
as
other
wretches
who
if
suffered
to
live
at
all
ought
to
partake
of
nothing
but
the
offal
and
ought
to
come
but
one
cut
before
the
dogs
and
cats
mind
you
there
is
in
my
opinion
no
land
in
england
that
surpasses
this
there
is
i
suppose
as
good
in
the
three
last
counties
that
i
have
come
through
but
than
this
is
i
should
think
impossible
there
is
a
of
about
a
hundred
acres
close
to
swindon
belonging
to
a
goddard
which
with
its
cattle
and
sheep
was
a
most
beautiful
sight
but
everything
is
full
of
riches
and
as
fast
as
skill
and
care
and
industry
can
extract
these
riches
from
the
land
the
unseen
grasp
of
taxation
and
monopolizing
takes
them
away
leaving
the
labourers
not
half
a
compelling
the
farmer
to
pinch
them
or
to
be
ruined
himself
and
making
even
the
landowner
little
better
than
a
steward
or
bailiff
for
the
jews
and
jobbers
just
before
we
got
to
swindon
we
crossed
a
canal
at
a
place
where
there
is
a
wharf
and
a
and
close
by
these
a
gentleman
house
with
stables
paddock
and
the
rest
of
those
things
which
all
together
make
up
surpassing
the
second
and
approaching
towards
the
first
class
seeing
a
man
in
the
i
asked
him
to
what
gentleman
the
house
belonged
to
the
o
the
canal
said
he
and
when
upon
further
inquiry
of
him
i
found
that
it
was
the
villa
of
the
chief
manager
i
could
not
help
congratulating
the
proprietors
of
this
aquatic
concern
for
though
i
did
not
ask
the
name
of
the
canal
i
could
readily
suppose
that
the
profits
must
be
prodigious
when
the
residence
of
the
manager
would
imply
no
disparagement
of
dignity
if
occupied
by
a
secretary
of
state
for
the
home
or
even
for
the
foreign
department
i
mean
an
secretary
of
state
for
as
to
an
one
his
salary
would
be
wholly
inadequate
to
a
residence
in
a
mansion
like
this
from
swindon
we
came
up
into
the
and
these
downs
rise
higher
even
than
the
cotswold
we
left
marlborough
away
to
our
right
and
came
along
the
turnpike
road
towards
hungerford
but
with
a
view
of
leaving
that
town
to
our
left
further
on
and
going
away
through
ramsbury
towards
the
northernmost
hampshire
hills
under
which
burghclere
where
we
now
are
lies
we
passed
some
fine
farms
upon
these
downs
the
houses
and
homesteads
of
which
were
near
the
road
my
companion
though
he
had
been
to
london
and
even
to
france
had
never
seen
before
and
it
was
amusing
to
me
to
witness
his
surprise
at
seeing
the
immense
flocks
of
sheep
which
were
now
ten
just
going
out
from
their
several
folds
to
the
downs
for
the
day
each
having
its
shepherd
and
each
shepherd
his
dog
we
passed
the
homestead
of
a
farmer
woodman
with
banging
in
the
two
of
which
were
old
ones
and
and
all
round
about
seemed
to
be
swarming
with
fowls
ducks
and
turkeys
and
on
the
whole
of
them
not
one
feather
but
what
was
white
turning
our
eyes
from
this
sight
we
saw
just
going
out
from
the
folds
of
this
same
farm
three
separate
and
numerous
flocks
of
sheep
one
of
which
the
we
passed
close
by
the
side
of
the
shepherd
told
us
that
his
flock
consisted
of
thirteen
score
and
five
but
apparently
he
could
not
if
it
had
been
to
save
his
soul
tell
us
how
many
hundreds
he
had
and
if
you
reflect
a
little
you
will
find
that
his
way
of
counting
is
much
the
easiest
and
best
this
was
a
most
beautiful
flock
of
lambs
short
legged
and
in
every
respect
what
they
ought
to
be
george
though
born
and
bred
amongst
had
never
before
seen
sheep
with
faces
and
legs
but
his
surprise
at
this
sight
was
not
nearly
so
great
as
the
surprise
of
both
of
us
at
seeing
numerous
and
very
large
pieces
sometimes
acres
together
of
very
good
early
turnips
swedish
as
well
as
white
all
the
three
counties
of
worcester
hereford
and
gloucester
except
on
the
cotswold
do
not
i
am
convinced
contain
as
great
a
weight
of
turnip
bulbs
as
we
here
saw
in
one
single
for
here
there
are
for
miles
and
miles
no
hedges
and
no
fences
of
any
sort
doubtless
they
must
have
had
here
in
the
months
of
june
and
july
but
as
i
once
before
observed
though
i
forget
a
chalk
bottom
does
not
suffer
the
surface
to
burn
however
shallow
the
top
soil
may
be
it
seems
to
me
to
absorb
and
to
the
water
and
to
keep
it
ready
to
be
drawn
up
by
the
heat
of
the
sun
at
any
rate
the
fact
is
that
the
surface
above
it
does
not
burn
for
there
never
yet
was
a
summer
not
even
this
last
when
the
downs
did
not
their
greenness
to
a
certain
while
the
rich
pastures
and
even
the
meadows
except
actually
were
burnt
so
as
to
be
as
brown
as
the
bare
earth
this
is
a
most
pleasing
circumstance
attending
the
and
there
are
no
without
a
chalk
bottom
along
here
the
country
is
rather
here
until
you
come
to
auborne
or
aldbourne
there
are
in
the
valleys
and
no
trees
even
round
the
homesteads
this
therefore
is
too
naked
to
please
me
but
i
love
so
much
that
if
i
had
to
choose
i
would
live
even
here
and
especially
i
would
here
rather
than
on
the
banks
of
the
wye
in
herefordshire
in
the
vale
of
gloucester
of
worcester
or
of
evesham
or
even
in
what
the
kentish
men
call
their
garden
of
eden
i
have
now
seen
for
i
have
years
back
seen
the
vales
of
taunton
glastonbury
honiton
dorchester
and
sherburne
what
are
deemed
the
richest
and
most
beautiful
parts
of
england
and
if
called
upon
to
name
the
spot
which
i
deem
the
brightest
and
most
beautiful
and
of
its
extent
of
all
i
should
say
the
villages
of
bovant
and
between
heytesbury
and
warminster
in
wiltshire
for
there
is
as
appertaining
to
rural
objects
that
i
delight
in
smooth
and
verdant
downs
in
hills
and
valleys
of
endless
variety
as
to
height
and
depth
and
shape
rich
unencumbered
by
fences
meadows
in
due
proportion
and
those
watered
at
pleasure
and
lastly
the
homesteads
and
villages
sheltered
in
winter
and
shaded
in
summer
by
lofty
and
beautiful
trees
to
which
may
be
added
roads
never
dirty
and
a
stream
never
dry
when
we
came
to
auborne
we
got
amongst
trees
again
this
is
a
and
was
manifestly
once
a
large
town
its
church
is
as
big
as
three
of
that
of
kensington
it
has
a
market
now
i
believe
but
i
suppose
it
is
like
many
others
become
merely
nominal
the
produce
being
nearly
all
carried
to
hungerford
in
order
to
be
forwarded
to
the
and
the
and
monopolizers
in
the
wen
and
in
small
wens
on
the
way
it
is
a
and
i
dare
say
that
it
would
be
nearly
depopulated
in
twenty
years
time
if
this
hellish
jobbing
system
were
to
last
so
long
a
little
after
we
came
through
auborne
we
turned
off
to
our
right
to
go
through
ramsbury
to
shallburn
where
tull
the
father
of
the
began
and
practised
that
husbandry
at
a
farm
called
prosperous
our
object
was
to
reach
this
place
burghclere
to
sleep
and
to
stay
for
a
day
or
two
and
as
i
knew
blandy
of
prosperous
i
determined
upon
this
route
which
besides
took
us
out
of
the
we
stopped
at
ramsbury
to
bait
our
horses
it
is
a
large
and
apparently
miserable
village
or
town
as
the
people
call
it
it
was
in
remote
times
a
its
church
is
very
large
and
very
ancient
parts
of
it
were
evidently
built
long
and
long
before
the
norman
conquest
burdett
owns
a
great
many
of
the
houses
in
the
village
which
contains
nearly
two
thousand
people
and
will
if
he
live
many
years
own
nearly
the
whole
for
as
his
eulogist
william
friend
the
actuary
told
the
public
in
a
pamphlet
in
he
has
resolved
that
his
numerous
shall
run
and
that
those
who
were
under
his
aunt
from
whom
he
got
the
estate
shall
become
to
or
quit
the
occupations
besides
this
he
is
continually
purchasing
lands
and
houses
round
about
and
in
this
place
he
has
now
let
his
house
to
a
mr
acres
and
as
the
says
is
safe
landed
at
bordeaux
with
his
family
for
the
winter
when
here
he
did
not
occupy
a
square
inch
of
his
land
he
let
it
all
park
and
all
and
only
reserved
a
right
of
road
from
the
highway
to
his
door
he
had
and
has
to
do
all
this
a
who
denies
that
but
is
this
giving
us
a
specimen
of
that
liberality
and
generosity
and
hospitality
of
those
english
country
gentlemen
whose
praises
he
so
loudly
sang
last
winter
his
name
is
francis
burdett
which
last
name
he
was
obliged
to
take
by
his
aunt
will
and
he
actually
used
it
for
some
time
after
the
estate
came
to
him
jones
was
too
common
a
name
for
him
i
suppose
sounded
too
much
of
the
however
what
i
have
principally
to
do
with
is
his
from
the
at
a
time
like
this
and
if
the
newspapers
be
correct
his
intended
absence
during
the
whole
of
next
winter
and
such
a
winter
too
as
it
is
likely
to
be
he
for
many
years
complained
and
justly
of
the
and
are
we
to
suffer
him
to
be
thus
a
sinecure
member
of
parliament
this
is
in
my
opinion
a
great
deal
worse
than
a
sinecure
placeman
for
this
is
shutting
an
active
member
out
it
is
a
offence
and
to
the
people
of
a
place
such
as
westminster
it
is
not
only
an
injury
but
a
most
outrageous
insult
if
it
be
true
that
he
intends
to
stay
away
during
the
coming
session
of
parliament
i
trust
not
only
that
he
never
will
be
elected
again
but
that
the
people
of
westminster
will
call
upon
him
to
resign
and
this
i
am
sure
they
will
do
too
the
next
session
of
parliament
be
a
most
important
one
and
that
he
knows
well
every
member
will
be
put
to
the
test
in
the
next
session
of
parliament
on
the
question
of
every
man
must
declare
for
or
against
the
people
he
would
declare
against
if
he
dared
and
therefore
he
gets
out
of
the
way
or
this
is
what
we
shall
have
a
clear
right
to
presume
if
he
be
absent
from
the
next
session
of
parliament
he
knows
that
there
must
be
something
like
a
struggle
between
the
and
the
his
interest
lies
with
the
former
he
wishes
to
support
the
and
the
army
and
all
sources
of
aristocratical
profit
but
he
knows
that
the
people
of
westminster
would
be
on
the
other
side
it
is
better
therefore
to
hear
at
bordeaux
about
this
struggle
than
to
be
engaged
in
it
he
must
know
of
the
great
embarrassment
distress
and
of
the
great
bodily
suffering
now
experienced
by
a
large
part
of
the
people
and
has
he
after
having
got
himself
returned
a
member
for
such
a
place
as
westminster
to
go
out
of
the
country
at
such
a
time
and
leave
his
seat
vacant
he
must
know
that
during
the
ensuing
winter
there
be
great
distress
in
westminster
itself
for
there
will
be
a
greater
mass
of
the
working
people
out
of
employ
than
there
ever
was
in
any
winter
before
and
this
calamity
will
too
be
owing
to
that
infernal
system
which
he
has
been
supporting
to
those
rooks
with
whom
he
is
closely
connected
and
the
existence
of
whose
destructive
rags
he
expressed
his
wish
to
prolong
he
knows
all
this
very
well
he
knows
that
in
every
quarter
the
distress
and
danger
are
great
and
is
it
not
then
his
duty
to
be
here
is
he
who
at
his
own
request
has
been
intrusted
with
the
representing
of
a
great
city
to
get
out
of
the
way
at
a
time
like
this
and
under
circumstances
like
these
if
this
be
so
then
is
this
great
and
city
become
more
contemptible
and
infinitely
more
mischievous
than
the
accursed
hill
of
wiltshire
but
this
is
the
of
westminster
are
what
they
always
were
full
of
good
sense
and
public
spirit
they
have
been
cheated
by
a
set
of
bribed
intriguers
and
this
has
been
done
i
will
explain
to
them
when
i
sir
francis
burdett
jones
for
the
sins
for
by
a
hired
scotch
writer
i
shall
dismiss
him
for
the
present
with
observing
that
if
i
had
in
me
a
millionth
part
of
that
malignity
and
vindictiveness
which
he
so
basely
showed
towards
me
i
have
learned
anecdotes
sufficient
to
enable
me
to
take
ample
vengeance
on
him
for
the
stabs
which
he
in
knew
that
he
was
sending
to
the
hearts
of
the
defenceless
part
of
my
family
while
our
horses
were
baiting
at
ramsbury
it
began
to
rain
and
by
the
time
that
they
had
done
it
rained
pretty
hard
with
every
appearance
of
continuing
to
rain
for
the
day
and
it
was
now
about
eleven
we
having
or
miles
to
go
before
we
got
to
the
intended
end
of
our
journey
having
however
for
several
reasons
a
very
great
desire
to
get
to
burghclere
that
night
we
set
off
in
the
rain
and
as
we
carry
no
great
coats
we
were
wet
to
the
skin
pretty
soon
immediately
upon
quitting
ramsbury
we
crossed
the
river
kennet
and
mounting
a
highish
hill
we
looked
back
over
friend
sir
glory
park
the
sight
of
which
brought
into
my
mind
the
visit
of
thimble
and
cowhide
as
described
in
the
intense
comedy
and
when
i
thought
of
the
baker
being
starved
to
death
and
of
the
heavy
fall
of
snow
i
could
not
help
bursting
out
a
laughing
though
it
poured
of
rain
and
though
i
already
felt
the
water
on
my
mem
to
ask
when
i
get
to
london
what
is
become
of
the
intense
counsellor
bric
and
whether
he
have
yet
had
the
justice
to
put
the
k
to
the
end
of
his
name
i
saw
a
lovely
female
engaged
in
keeping
the
rooks
from
a
wheat
field
on
the
cotswold
hills
that
would
be
a
very
for
him
and
as
his
manners
appear
to
be
mended
as
he
now
praises
to
the
skies
those
freeholders
whom
in
my
hearing
he
asserted
to
be
brute
as
he
does
in
short
appear
to
be
rather
less
offensive
than
he
was
i
should
have
no
objection
to
promote
the
union
and
i
am
sure
would
like
it
of
all
things
for
if
miss
can
when
keep
the
devourers
at
a
distance
say
you
who
know
him
whether
the
sight
of
the
would
leave
a
rook
in
the
country
turning
from
viewing
the
scene
of
thimble
and
cowhide
cruel
disappointment
we
pushed
through
coppices
and
across
fields
to
a
little
village
called
froxfield
which
we
found
to
be
on
the
great
here
crossing
the
road
and
also
a
run
of
water
we
under
the
guidance
of
a
man
who
was
good
enough
to
go
about
a
mile
with
us
and
to
whom
we
gave
a
shilling
and
the
price
of
a
pot
of
beer
mounted
another
hill
from
which
after
twisting
about
for
awhile
i
saw
and
recognised
the
of
prosperous
farm
towards
which
we
pushed
on
as
fast
as
we
could
in
order
to
keep
ourselves
in
motion
so
as
to
prevent
our
catching
cold
for
it
rained
and
incessantly
every
step
of
the
way
i
had
been
at
prosperous
before
so
that
i
knew
blandy
the
owner
and
his
family
who
received
us
with
great
hospitality
they
took
care
of
our
horses
gave
us
what
we
wanted
in
the
eating
and
drinking
way
and
clothed
us
shirts
and
all
while
they
dried
all
our
clothes
for
not
only
the
things
on
our
bodies
were
soaked
but
those
also
which
we
carried
in
little
thin
leather
rolls
fastened
on
upon
the
saddles
before
us
notwithstanding
all
that
could
be
done
in
the
way
of
dispatch
it
took
more
than
three
hours
to
get
our
clothes
dry
at
last
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
before
sunset
we
got
on
our
clothes
again
and
set
off
for
as
an
instance
of
real
bad
luck
it
ceased
to
rain
the
moment
we
got
to
blandy
including
the
numerous
angles
and
windings
we
had
nine
or
ten
miles
yet
to
go
but
i
was
so
anxious
to
get
to
burghclere
that
contrary
to
my
practice
as
well
as
my
principle
i
determined
to
encounter
the
darkness
for
once
though
in
roads
presenting
us
at
every
mile
with
ways
crossing
each
other
or
forming
a
y
or
kindly
giving
us
the
choice
of
three
forming
the
upper
part
of
a
y
and
a
half
add
to
this
that
we
were
in
an
enclosed
country
the
lanes
very
narrow
and
banks
and
hedges
high
there
was
no
moon
but
it
was
starlight
and
as
i
could
see
the
hampshire
hills
all
along
to
my
right
and
knew
that
i
must
not
get
above
a
mile
or
so
from
them
i
had
a
guide
that
could
not
deceive
me
for
as
to
the
road
in
a
case
like
this
it
is
of
little
use
unless
you
meet
some
one
at
every
half
mile
for
the
answer
is
right
aye
but
in
ten
minutes
perhaps
you
come
to
a
y
or
to
a
t
or
to
a
a
fellow
told
me
once
in
my
way
from
chertsey
to
guildford
keep
you
ca
miss
your
way
i
was
in
the
perpendicular
part
of
the
t
and
the
top
part
was
only
a
few
yards
from
me
said
i
what
over
into
the
wheat
no
no
said
he
i
mean
to
be
sure
pointing
to
the
road
that
went
off
to
the
in
the
direction
of
shepherds
and
pig
and
bird
boys
is
always
in
precisely
the
same
words
namely
over
the
down
laying
great
stress
upon
the
word
but
said
i
to
a
boy
at
the
edge
of
the
down
at
king
worthy
near
winchester
who
gave
me
this
direction
to
stoke
charity
but
what
do
you
mean
by
over
the
down
why
said
he
on
to
stoke
to
be
sure
zur
aye
said
i
but
how
am
i
who
was
never
here
before
to
know
right
my
boy
that
posed
him
it
set
him
to
thinking
and
after
a
bit
he
proceeded
to
tell
me
that
when
i
got
up
the
hill
i
should
see
that
i
should
go
along
by
them
that
i
should
then
see
right
before
me
that
i
should
go
down
to
that
barn
and
that
i
should
then
see
a
that
would
lead
me
all
down
to
stoke
aye
said
i
indeed
you
are
a
real
clever
fellow
and
i
gave
him
a
shilling
being
part
of
my
savings
of
the
morning
whoever
tries
it
will
find
that
the
they
eat
and
when
travelling
the
better
they
will
be
i
act
accordingly
many
days
i
have
no
breakfast
and
no
dinner
i
went
from
devizes
to
highworth
without
breaking
my
fast
a
distance
including
my
deviations
of
more
than
i
sometimes
take
from
a
friend
house
a
little
bit
of
meat
between
two
bits
of
bread
which
i
eat
as
i
ride
along
but
whatever
i
save
from
this
fasting
work
i
think
i
have
a
clear
right
to
give
away
and
accordingly
i
generally
put
the
amount
in
copper
into
my
waistcoat
pocket
and
dispose
of
it
during
the
day
i
know
well
i
am
the
for
not
stuffing
and
blowing
myself
out
and
with
the
savings
i
make
many
and
many
a
happy
boy
and
i
give
a
whole
family
a
good
meal
with
the
cost
of
a
breakfast
or
a
dinner
that
would
have
done
me
mischief
i
do
not
do
this
because
i
grudge
what
they
charge
for
my
surprise
is
how
they
can
live
without
charging
than
they
do
in
general
it
was
dark
by
the
time
that
we
got
to
a
village
called
east
woodhay
sunday
evening
is
the
time
in
the
country
it
is
not
convenient
to
carry
this
on
before
faces
and
at
farmhouses
and
cottages
there
are
no
spare
apartments
so
that
the
pairs
turn
out
and
pitch
up
to
carry
on
their
negociations
by
the
side
of
stile
or
a
gate
the
evening
was
auspicious
it
was
the
and
when
yearly
services
end
was
fast
approaching
and
accordingly
i
do
not
recollect
ever
having
before
seen
so
many
negociations
going
on
within
so
short
a
distance
at
west
woodhay
my
horse
a
and
as
the
road
was
abominably
flinty
we
were
compelled
to
go
at
a
snail
pace
and
i
should
have
gone
crazy
with
impatience
had
it
not
been
for
these
ambassadors
and
ambassadresses
of
cupid
to
every
pair
of
whom
i
said
something
or
other
i
began
by
asking
the
fellow
and
from
the
tone
and
manner
of
his
answer
i
could
tell
pretty
nearly
what
prospect
he
had
of
success
and
knew
what
to
say
to
draw
something
from
him
i
had
some
famous
sport
with
them
saying
to
them
more
than
i
should
have
said
by
daylight
and
a
great
deal
less
than
i
should
have
said
if
my
horse
had
been
in
a
condition
to
carry
me
away
as
swiftly
as
he
did
from
osmond
ricardo
terrific
cross
there
exclaims
scrip
the
young
wife
to
her
old
hobbling
wittol
of
a
spouse
you
see
my
love
that
this
mischievous
man
could
not
let
even
these
poor
alone
you
devil
and
where
got
you
that
word
you
who
but
a
few
years
ago
came
perhaps
up
from
the
country
in
a
wagon
who
the
bed
you
now
in
and
who
got
the
husband
by
helping
him
to
get
his
wife
out
of
the
world
as
some
young
blade
is
to
get
you
and
the
old
rogue
money
by
a
similar
process
we
got
to
burghclere
about
eight
after
a
very
disagreeable
day
but
we
found
ample
compensation
in
the
house
and
all
within
it
that
we
were
now
arrived
at
sunday
it
rained
steadily
this
morning
or
else
at
the
end
of
these
six
days
of
hunting
for
george
and
two
for
me
we
should
have
set
off
the
rain
gives
me
time
to
give
an
account
of
budd
crop
of
tullian
wheat
it
was
sown
in
rows
and
on
ridges
with
very
wide
intervals
ploughed
all
summer
if
he
reckon
that
ground
only
which
the
wheat
grew
upon
he
had
one
hundred
and
thirty
bushels
to
the
acre
and
even
if
he
reckoned
the
whole
of
the
ground
he
had
bushels
all
but
two
gallons
to
the
acre
but
the
best
wheat
he
grew
this
year
was
dibbled
in
between
rows
of
swedish
turnips
in
november
four
rows
upon
a
ridge
with
an
interval
between
each
two
rows
and
a
interval
between
the
outside
rows
on
each
ridge
it
is
the
white
cone
that
budd
sows
he
had
ears
with
grains
in
each
this
would
be
the
farming
for
labourers
in
their
little
plots
they
might
grow
thirty
bushels
of
wheat
to
the
acre
and
have
crops
of
cabbages
in
the
intervals
at
the
same
time
or
of
potatoes
if
they
liked
them
better
before
my
arrival
here
budd
had
seen
my
description
of
the
state
of
the
labourers
in
wiltshire
and
had
in
consequence
written
to
my
son
james
not
knowing
where
i
was
as
follows
in
order
to
see
how
the
labourers
are
now
look
at
the
following
facts
arthur
young
in
years
ago
allowed
for
a
man
his
wife
and
three
children
a
week
according
to
present
by
the
berkshire
magistrates
table
made
in
the
allowance
was
for
such
family
according
to
the
present
now
it
is
according
to
the
same
standard
according
to
your
proposal
the
sum
would
be
supposing
there
to
be
no
malt
tax
a
week
and
little
enough
too
is
not
that
enough
to
convince
any
one
of
the
hellishness
of
this
system
yet
sir
glory
applauds
it
is
it
not
horrible
to
contemplate
millions
in
this
state
and
is
it
not
the
duty
of
england
glory
who
has
said
that
his
estate
is
retaining
for
defending
the
rights
of
the
people
is
it
not
his
duty
to
stay
in
england
and
endeavour
to
restore
the
people
the
millions
to
what
their
fathers
were
instead
of
going
abroad
selling
off
his
carriage
horses
and
going
abroad
there
to
spend
some
part
at
least
of
the
fruits
of
english
labour
i
do
not
say
that
he
has
generally
speaking
to
go
and
spend
his
money
abroad
but
i
do
say
that
having
got
himself
elected
for
such
a
city
as
westminster
he
had
no
right
at
a
time
like
this
to
be
absent
from
parliament
however
what
cares
he
his
retaining
fee
indeed
he
takes
special
care
to
augment
that
fee
but
i
challenge
all
his
all
the
base
worshippers
of
twenty
thousand
acres
to
show
me
one
single
thing
that
he
has
ever
done
or
within
the
last
twelve
years
attempted
to
do
for
his
in
short
this
is
a
man
that
must
now
be
brought
to
book
he
must
not
be
suffered
to
insult
westminster
any
longer
he
must
or
turn
out
he
is
a
sore
to
westminster
a
on
its
back
a
cholic
in
its
belly
a
cramp
in
its
limbs
a
gag
in
its
mouth
he
is
a
nuisance
a
monstrous
nuisance
in
westminster
and
he
must
be
abated
ride
from
burghclere
to
lyndhurst
in
the
new
forest
the
reformers
have
yet
many
and
powerful
foes
we
have
to
contend
against
a
host
such
as
never
existed
before
in
the
world
of
the
press
all
the
channels
of
speedy
communication
of
sentiment
all
the
pulpits
all
the
associations
of
rich
people
all
the
all
the
military
and
naval
establishments
all
the
yeomanry
cavalry
tribes
your
allies
are
endless
in
number
and
mighty
in
influence
but
we
have
worth
the
whole
of
them
put
together
namely
the
debt
this
is
an
ally
whom
no
honours
or
rewards
can
seduce
from
us
she
is
a
steady
unrelaxing
persevering
incorruptible
ally
an
ally
that
is
proof
against
all
blandishments
all
intrigues
all
temptations
and
all
open
attacks
she
sets
at
defiance
all
all
they
may
as
well
fire
at
a
ghost
she
cares
no
more
for
the
sabres
of
the
yeomanry
or
the
life
guards
than
angels
did
for
the
swords
of
satan
myrmidons
this
ally
cares
not
a
straw
about
and
she
laughs
at
the
employment
of
she
is
always
erect
day
and
night
and
is
always
firmly
moving
on
in
our
cause
in
spite
of
all
the
terrors
of
gaols
dungeons
halters
and
axes
therefore
jabet
be
not
so
pert
the
combat
is
not
so
unequal

you
seem

wednesday
october
when
quarters
are
good
you
are
apt
to
in
them
but
really
it
was
so
wet
that
we
could
not
get
away
from
burghclere
till
monday
evening
being
here
there
were
many
reasons
for
our
going
to
the
great
fair
at
weyhill
which
began
yesterday
and
indeed
the
day
before
at
appleshaw
these
two
days
are
allotted
for
the
selling
of
sheep
only
though
the
begins
on
the
to
appleshaw
they
bring
nothing
but
those
fine
and
ewes
which
bring
the
and
the
early
and
these
which
to
my
taste
are
the
finest
and
most
beautiful
animals
of
the
sheep
kind
come
exclusively
out
of
dorsetshire
and
out
of
the
part
of
somersetshire
bordering
on
that
county
to
weyhill
which
is
a
village
of
half
a
dozen
houses
on
a
down
just
above
appleshaw
they
bring
from
the
in
wiltshire
and
hampshire
where
they
are
bred
the
southdown
sheep
ewes
to
go
away
into
the
pasture
and
turnip
countries
to
have
lambs
wethers
to
be
fatted
and
killed
and
lambs
nine
months
old
to
be
kept
to
be
sheep
at
both
fairs
there
is
supposed
to
be
about
two
hundred
thousand
sheep
it
was
of
some
consequence
to
ascertain
how
the
of
these
had
been
affected
by
panic
which
ended
the
respite
of
or
by
the
plethora
of
money
as
baring
called
it
i
can
assure
this
political
doctor
that
there
was
no
such
plethora
at
weyhill
yesterday
where
while
i
viewed
the
long
faces
of
the
farmers
while
i
saw
consciousness
of
ruin
painted
on
their
countenances
i
could
not
help
saying
to
myself
the
think
they
are
but
by
they
will
never
escape
the
ultimate
consequences
of
this
horrible
ruin
the
prices
take
them
on
a
fair
average
were
at
both
fairs
just
about
what
they
were
last
year
so
that
my
friend
thwaites
of
the
who
had
a
lying
irish
reporter
at
preston
was
rather
hasty
about
three
months
ago
when
he
told
his
readers
that
those
politicians
were
deceived
who
had
supposed
that
prices
of
farm
produce
would
fall
in
consequence
of
panic
and
the
subsequent
measures
there
were
dorsetshire
ewes
that
sold
last
year
for
a
head
we
could
hear
of
none
this
year
that
exceeded
and
only
think
of
for
one
of
these
fine
large
ewes
nearly
fit
to
kill
and
having
two
lambs
in
her
ready
to
be
brought
forth
in
on
an
average
six
weeks
time
the
average
is
to
of
these
in
these
ewes
were
from
to
each
at
this
same
appleshaw
fair
and
in
that
year
i
bought
ewes
at
each
just
such
as
were
yesterday
sold
for
yet
the
sheep
and
grass
and
all
things
are
the
same
in
what
a
false
what
a
deceptious
what
an
infamous
thing
this
system
is
however
it
is
a
pleasure
it
is
real
it
is
great
delight
it
is
boundless
joy
to
me
to
contemplate
this
infernal
system
in
its
hour
of
swag
here
crack
there
scroop
this
way
souse
that
way
and
such
a
rattling
and
such
a
squalling
and
the
parsons
and
their
wives
looking
so
frightened
beginning
apparently
to
think
that
the
day
of
is
at
hand
i
wonder
what
master
parson
of
sharncut
whose
church
contain
and
master
parson
of
draycot
foliot
who
is
for
want
of
a
church
inducted
under
a
or
temporary
i
wonder
what
they
think
of
lambs
months
old
selling
for
or
shillings
each
i
wonder
what
the
barings
and
the
ricardos
think
of
it
i
wonder
what
those
master
parsons
think
of
it
who
are
naval
or
military
officers
as
well
as
master
parsons
of
the
church
made
by
i
wonder
what
the
gaffer
gooches
with
their
parsonships
and
military
offices
think
of
it
i
wonder
what
daddy
coke
and
suffield
think
of
it
and
when
i
wonder
do
they
mean
to
get
into
their
holes
and
barns
again
to
cry
aloud
against
the
roguery
of
reducing
the
interest
of
the
debt
when
i
wonder
do
these
manly
these
modest
these
fair
these
candid
these
open
and
above
all
things
these
fellows
intend
to
assemble
again
and
to
call
all
the
house
of
quidenham
and
the
house
of
kilmainham
or
or
whatever
it
is
for
i
really
have
forgotten
to
call
i
say
all
these
about
them
in
the
holes
and
the
barns
and
then
and
there
again
make
a
formal
and
solemn
protest
against
cobbett
and
against
his
roguish
proposition
for
reducing
the
interest
of
the
debt
now
i
have
these
fellows
on
the
hip
and
brave
sport
will
i
have
with
them
before
i
have
done
blount
at
whose
house
miles
from
weyhill
i
am
went
with
me
to
the
fair
and
we
took
particular
pains
to
ascertain
the
prices
we
saw
and
spoke
to
john
herbert
of
stoke
near
uphusband
who
was
and
who
did
not
expect
to
it
for
ewes
just
such
as
he
last
year
at
this
fair
for
jolliff
of
was
for
just
such
ewes
as
he
sold
last
year
at
this
fair
for
farmer
holdway
had
sold
for
less
than
half
his
last
year
price
a
farmer
that
i
did
not
know
told
us
that
he
had
sold
to
a
great
of
the
name
of
smallpiece
at
the
latter
own
price
i
asked
him
what
that
own
price
was
and
he
said
that
he
was
ashamed
to
say
the
appeared
to
have
no
business
at
all
going
on
for
indeed
how
were
people
to
purchase
horses
who
had
got
only
for
their
sheep
the
sales
of
sheep
at
this
one
fair
including
appleshaw
must
have
amounted
this
year
to
a
hundred
and
twenty
or
thirty
thousand
pounds
less
than
last
year
stick
a
pin
there
master
prosperity
robinson
and
turn
back
to
it
again
anon
then
came
the
horses
not
equal
in
amount
to
the
sheep
but
of
great
amount
then
comes
the
cheese
a
very
great
article
and
it
will
have
a
falling
off
if
you
take
quantity
into
view
in
a
still
greater
proportion
the
hops
being
a
monstrous
crop
their
is
nothing
to
judge
by
but
all
is
fallen
even
corn
though
in
many
parts
all
but
the
wheat
and
rye
have
totally
failed
is
taking
a
quarter
of
each
of
the
wheat
rye
barley
oats
pease
and
beans
cheaper
upon
the
whole
that
is
to
say
upon
and
if
the
panic
had
not
come
it
must
and
it
would
have
been
and
according
to
the
small
bulk
of
the
crop
it
ought
to
have
been
instead
of
cheaper
yet
it
is
too
dear
and
far
too
dear
for
the
working
people
to
eat
the
masses
the
assembled
masses
must
starve
if
the
price
of
bread
be
not
reduced
that
is
to
say
in
scotland
and
ireland
for
i
hope
that
the
people
will
and
to
use
the
language
of
the
bill
of
rights
on
a
just
and
suitable
provision
agreeably
to
the
law
and
if
they
do
not
get
it
i
trust
that
law
and
justice
will
in
due
course
be
done
and
strictly
done
upon
those
who
refuse
to
make
such
provision
though
in
time
the
price
of
corn
will
come
down
without
any
repeal
of
the
corn
bill
and
though
it
would
have
come
down
now
if
we
had
had
a
good
crop
or
an
average
crop
still
the
corn
bill
ought
now
to
be
repealed
because
people
must
not
be
in
waiting
for
the
next
crop
and
the
monopoly
as
the
son
of
john
with
the
bright
sword
calls
it
ought
to
be
swept
away
and
the
sooner
it
is
done
the
better
for
the
country
i
know
very
well
that
the
landowners
must
lose
their
estates
if
such
prices
continue
and
if
the
present
taxes
continue
i
know
this
very
well
and
i
like
it
well
for
the
landowners
cause
the
taxes
to
be
taken
off
if
they
ah
wicked
dog
say
they
what
then
you
would
have
us
lose
the
half
pay
and
the
pensions
and
sinecures
which
our
children
and
other
relations
or
that
we
ourselves
are
pocketing
out
of
the
taxes
which
are
squeezed
in
great
part
out
of
the
skin
and
bone
yes
upon
my
word
i
would
but
if
you
prefer
losing
your
estates
i
have
no
great
objection
for
it
is
hard
that
in
a
free
country
people
should
not
have
their
choice
of
the
different
roads
to
the
here
is
the
the
the
the
big
have
directly
and
indirectly
so
large
a
share
of
the
loaves
and
fishes
that
the
share
is
in
point
of
clear
income
equal
to
and
in
some
cases
greater
than
that
from
their
estates
and
though
this
is
not
the
case
with
the
small
fry
of
jolterheads
they
are
so
linked
in
with
and
overawed
by
the
big
ones
that
they
have
all
the
same
feeling
and
that
is
that
to
cut
off
pensions
sinecures
commissionerships
such
as
that
of
hobhouse
father
army
and
the
rest
of
the
good
things
would
be
nearly
as
bad
as
to
take
away
the
estates
which
besides
are
in
fact
in
many
instances
nearly
gone
at
least
from
the
present
holder
already
by
the
means
of
mortgage
annuity
settlement
jointure
or
something
or
other
then
there
are
the
parsons
who
with
their
keen
noses
have
smelled
out
long
enough
ago
that
if
any
serious
settlement
should
take
place
to
a
certainty
in
short
they
know
well
how
the
whole
nation
the
interested
excepted
feel
towards
them
they
know
well
that
were
it
not
for
their
allies
it
would
soon
be
queer
times
with
them
here
then
is
the
here
are
the
reasons
why
the
taxes
are
not
taken
off
some
of
these
jolterheaded
beasts
were
ready
to
cry
and
i
know
one
that
did
actually
cry
to
a
farmer
his
tenant
in
the
tenant
told
him
that
cobbett
had
been
about
this
matter
what
exclaimed
he
i
hope
you
do
not
read
cobbett
he
will
ruin
you
and
he
would
ruin
us
all
he
would
introduce
anarchy
confusion
and
destruction
of
property
oh
no
jolterhead
there
is
no
of
property
matter
the
philosophers
say
is
but
it
is
all
easily
as
is
to
the
base
jolterheads
and
the
blaspheming
jews
the
former
of
these
will
however
soon
have
the
faint
sweat
upon
them
again
their
tenants
will
be
ruined
and
here
what
a
foul
robbery
these
landowners
have
committed
or
at
least
enjoyed
and
pocketed
the
gain
of
they
have
given
their
silent
assent
to
the
note
abolition
bill
they
knew
well
that
this
must
reduce
the
price
of
farm
produce
or
thereabouts
and
yet
they
were
prepared
to
take
and
to
insist
on
and
they
do
take
and
insist
on
as
high
rents
as
if
that
bill
had
never
been
passed
what
dreadful
ruin
will
ensue
how
many
many
farmers
families
are
now
just
preparing
the
way
for
their
entrance
into
the
how
many
certainly
many
a
score
farmers
did
i
see
at
weyhill
yesterday
who
came
there
as
it
were
know
their
and
who
are
gone
home
thoroughly
convinced
that
they
shall
as
farmers
never
see
weyhill
fair
again
when
such
a
man
his
mind
impressed
with
such
conviction
returns
home
and
there
beholds
a
family
of
children
half
bred
up
and
in
the
notion
that
they
were
to
be
mere
working
people
what
must
be
his
why
if
he
have
been
a
bawler
against
jacobins
and
radicals
if
he
have
approved
of
the
bill
and
of
aye
if
he
did
not
rejoice
at
castlereagh
cutting
his
own
throat
if
he
have
been
a
cruel
screwer
down
of
the
labourers
reducing
them
to
skeletons
if
he
have
been
an
officious
detecter
of
what
are
called
poachers
and
have
assisted
in
or
approved
of
the
hard
punishments
inflicted
on
them
then
in
either
of
these
cases
i
say
that
his
feelings
though
they
put
the
suicidal
knife
into
his
own
hand
are
short
of
what
he
deserves
i
say
this
and
this
i
repeat
with
all
the
seriousness
and
solemnity
with
which
a
man
can
make
a
declaration
for
had
it
not
been
for
these
base
and
selfish
and
unfeeling
wretches
the
deeds
of
and
and
would
never
have
been
attempted
these
hard
and
dastardly
dogs
armed
up
to
the
teeth
were
always
ready
to
come
forth
to
destroy
not
only
to
revile
to
decry
to
belie
to
calumniate
in
all
sorts
of
ways
but
if
necessary
absolutely
to
cut
the
throats
of
those
who
had
no
object
and
who
could
have
no
object
other
than
that
of
preventing
a
continuance
in
that
course
of
measures
which
have
finally
produced
the
ruin
and
threaten
to
produce
the
absolute
destruction
of
these
base
selfish
hard
and
dastardly
dogs
themselves
them
let
them
go
for
pity
to
those
whom
they
have
applauded
and
abetted
the
farmers
i
mean
the
renters
will
not
now
as
they
did
in
stand
a
good
long
emptying
out
they
had
in
lost
nearly
all
the
present
stock
of
the
farms
is
not
in
one
half
of
the
cases
the
property
of
the
farmer
it
is
borrowed
stock
and
the
sweeping
out
will
be
very
rapid
the
notion
that
the
ministers
will
do
something
is
clung
on
to
by
all
those
who
are
deeply
in
debt
and
all
who
have
leases
or
other
engagements
for
time
these
because
they
anxiously
that
the
by
means
of
some
sort
or
other
will
be
put
out
again
while
the
ministers
because
they
anxiously
that
the
thing
can
go
on
that
they
can
continue
to
pay
the
interest
of
the
debt
and
meet
all
the
rest
of
their
spendings
without
notes
and
without
both
parties
will
be
deceived
and
in
the
midst
of
the
strife
that
the
dissipation
of
the
delusion
will
infallibly
lead
to
the
whole
thing
is
very
likely
to
go
to
pieces
and
that
too
tumbling
into
the
hands
and
placed
at
the
mercy
of
a
people
the
millions
of
whom
have
been
fed
upon
less
to
four
persons
than
what
goes
down
the
throat
of
one
single
common
soldier
please
to
that
messieurs
the
admirers
of
select
vestries
you
have
done
messieurs
sturges
bourne
and
the
hampshire
parsons
you
you
had
you
meaned
well
but
it
was
a
a
missing
of
the
mark
and
that
too
as
is
frequently
the
case
by
it
the
attempt
will
however
produce
its
just
consequences
in
the
end
and
those
consequences
will
be
of
vast
importance
from
weyhill
i
was
shown
yesterday
the
wood
in
which
took
place
the
battle
in
which
was
concerned
poor
turner
one
of
the
young
men
who
was
hanged
at
winchester
in
the
year
there
was
another
young
man
named
smith
who
was
on
account
of
another
hanged
on
the
same
gallows
and
this
for
the
preservation
of
the
you
will
observe
this
for
the
preservation
of
the
of
that
aristocracy
for
whose
sake
and
solely
for
whose
sake
sir
james
graham
of
netherby
descendant
of
the
earls
of
monteith
and
of
the
seventh
earl
of
galloway
being
sure
not
to
omit
the
this
hanging
of
us
is
for
the
preservation
of
the
sports
of
that
aristocracy
for
the
sake
of
whom
this
graham
this
barefaced
plagiarist
this
bungling
and
yet
impudent
pamphleteer
would
would
reduce
to
beggary
according
to
his
pamphlet
hundred
thousand
making
doubtless
of
persons
in
the
middle
rank
of
life
it
is
for
the
preservation
for
upholding
what
he
insolently
calls
the
dignity
of
this
sporting
aristocracy
that
he
proposes
to
rob
all
mortgagees
all
who
have
claims
upon
land
the
feudal
lords
in
france
had
as
young
tells
us
a
right
when
they
came
in
fatigued
from
hunting
or
shooting
to
cause
the
belly
of
one
of
their
vassals
to
be
ripped
up
in
order
for
the
lord
to
soak
his
feet
in
the
bowels
sir
james
graham
of
the
bright
sword
does
not
propose
to
carry
us
back
so
far
as
this
he
is
willing
to
stop
at
taking
away
the
money
and
the
victuals
of
a
very
large
part
of
the
community
and
monstrous
as
it
may
seem
i
will
venture
to
say
that
there
are
scores
of
the
tribe
who
think
him
moderate
to
a
fault
but
to
return
to
the
hanging
at
winchester
a
thing
never
to
be
forgotten
by
me
james
turner
aged
years
was
accused
of
assisting
to
kill
robert
baker
gamekeeper
to
thomas
asheton
smith
in
the
parish
of
south
tidworth
and
charles
smith
aged
years
was
accused
of
shooting
at
not
killing
robert
snellgrove
assistant
gamekeeper
to
lord
palmerston
secretary
at
war
at
broadlands
in
the
parish
of
romsey
poor
charles
smith
had
better
have
been
hunting
after
than
after
however
he
would
have
found
less
perilous
than
the
pleasure
grounds
of
lord
palmerston
i
deem
this
hanging
at
winchester
worthy
of
general
attention
and
particularly
at
this
time
when
the
aristocracy
near
andover
and
one
at
least
of
the
members
for
that
town
of
whom
this
very
thomas
asheton
smith
was
until
lately
one
was
if
the
report
in
the
copied
into
the
register
of
the
instant
be
correct
endeavouring
at
the
late
meeting
at
andover
to
persuade
people
that
they
these
aristocrats
wished
to
keep
up
the
price
of
corn
for
the
sake
of
the
labourers
whom
sir
john
pollen
thomas
asheton
son
present
colleague
as
member
for
andover
called
poor
devils
and
who
he
said
had
hardly
a
rag
to
cover
them
oh
wished
to
keep
up
the
price
of
corn
for
the
good
of
the
poor
devils
of
labourers
who
have
hardly
a
rag
to
cover
them
amiable
feeling
souls
cared
not
a
straw
about
did
not
oh
no
did
not
care
even
about
the
farmers
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
the
poor
naked
devils
of
labourers
that
the
colleague
of
young
thomas
asheton
smith
cared
it
was
only
for
those
who
were
in
the
same
rank
of
life
as
james
turner
and
charles
smith
were
that
these
kind
andover
aristocrats
cared
this
was
the
only
reason
in
the
world
for
their
wanting
corn
to
sell
at
a
high
price
we
often
say
beats
everything
but
really
i
think
that
these
professions
of
the
andover
aristocrats
do
ah
but
sir
john
pollen
these
professions
come
in
the
day
the
people
are
no
longer
to
be
deceived
by
such
stupid
attempts
at
disguising
hypocrisy
however
the
attempt
shall
do
this
it
shall
make
me
repeat
here
that
which
i
published
on
the
winchester
hanging
in
the
of
the
of
april
it
made
part
of
a
letter
to
landlords
many
boys
have
since
this
article
was
published
grown
up
to
the
age
of
thought
let
them
now
read
it
and
i
hope
that
they
will
it
i
last
fall
addressed
ten
letters
to
you
on
the
subject
of
the
my
object
was
to
convince
you
that
you
would
be
ruined
and
when
i
think
of
your
general
conduct
towards
the
rest
of
the
nation
and
especially
towards
the
labourers
i
must
say
that
i
have
great
pleasure
in
seeing
that
my
opinions
are
in
a
fair
way
of
being
verified
to
the
full
extent
i
dislike
the
but
the
jews
are
not
so
inimical
to
the
industrious
classes
of
the
country
as
you
are
we
should
do
a
great
deal
better
with
the
from
alley
who
at
any
rate
have
nothing
of
the
ferocious
and
bloody
in
their
characters
engrafted
upon
your
native
want
of
feeling
is
the
sort
of
military
spirit
of
command
that
you
have
acquired
during
the
late
war
you
appeared
at
the
close
of
that
war
to
think
that
you
had
made
a
of
the
rest
of
the
nation
for
ever
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
burdens
which
the
war
left
behind
it
there
would
have
been
no
such
thing
as
air
in
england
for
any
one
but
a
slave
to
breathe
the
bey
of
tunis
never
talked
to
his
subjects
in
language
more
insolent
than
you
talked
to
the
people
of
england
the
debt
the
blessed
debt
stood
our
friend
made
you
soften
your
tone
and
will
finally
place
you
where
you
ought
to
be
placed
this
is
the
last
letter
that
i
shall
ever
take
the
trouble
to
address
to
you
in
a
short
time
you
will
become
much
too
insignificant
to
merit
any
particular
notice
but
just
in
the
way
of
and
that
there
may
be
something
on
record
to
show
what
care
has
been
taken
of
the
partridges
pheasants
and
hares
while
the
estates
themselves
have
been
suffered
to
slide
away
i
have
resolved
to
address
this
one
more
letter
to
you
which
resolution
has
been
occasioned
by
the
recent
to
at
winchester
of
two
men
denominated
this
is
a
thing
which
whatever
you
may
think
of
it
has
not
been
passed
over
and
is
not
to
be
passed
over
without
full
notice
and
ample
record
the
account
of
the
matter
as
it
appeared
in
the
public
prints
was
very
short
but
the
fact
is
such
as
never
ought
to
be
forgotten
and
while
you
are
complaining
of
your
distress
i
will
endeavour
to
lay
before
the
public
that
which
will
show
that
the
has
not
been
unmindful
of
even
your
the
time
is
approaching
when
the
people
will
have
an
opportunity
of
exercising
their
judgment
as
to
what
are
called
when
they
will
look
back
a
little
at
what
has
been
done
for
the
sake
of
insuring
sport
to
landlords
in
short
landlords
as
well
as
labourers
will
under
but
i
must
proceed
to
my
subject
reserving
reflections
for
a
subsequent
part
of
my
letter
the
account
to
which
i
have
alluded
is
this
hampshire
the
lent
assizes
for
this
county
concluded
on
saturday
morning
the
criminal
calendar
contained
prisoners
for
trial
of
whom
have
been
sentenced
to
suffer
death
but
two
only
of
that
number
were
left
by
the
judges
for
execution
viz
james
turner
aged
for
aiding
and
assisting
in
killing
robert
baker
gamekeeper
to
thomas
asheton
smith
in
the
parish
of
south
tidworth
and
charles
smith
aged
for
having
wilfully
and
maliciously
shot
at
robert
snellgrove
assistant
gamekeeper
to
lord
palmerston
at
broadlands
in
the
parish
of
romsey
with
intent
to
do
him
grievous
bodily
harm
the
judge
burrough
observed
it
became
to
these
that
the
sentence
of
the
law
should
be
to
others
as
resistance
to
gamekeepers
was
now
arrived
at
an
alarming
and
many
lives
had
been
lost
the
first
thing
to
observe
here
is
that
there
were
persons
sentenced
to
suffer
death
and
that
the
only
persons
actually
put
to
death
were
those
who
had
been
endeavouring
to
get
at
the
hares
pheasants
or
partridges
of
thomas
asheton
smith
and
of
our
secretary
at
war
lord
palmerston
whether
the
judge
burrough
who
was
long
chairman
of
the
quarter
sessions
in
hampshire
uttered
the
words
ascribed
to
him
or
not
i
can
not
say
but
the
words
have
gone
forth
in
print
and
the
impression
they
are
calculated
to
make
is
this
that
it
was
necessary
to
put
these
two
to
in
order
to
deter
others
from
resisting
gamekeepers
the
putting
of
these
men
to
death
has
excited
a
very
deep
feeling
throughout
the
county
of
hants
a
feeling
very
honourable
to
the
people
of
that
county
and
very
natural
to
the
breast
of
every
human
being
in
this
case
there
appears
to
have
been
a
killing
in
which
turner
and
turner
might
by
possibility
have
given
the
fatal
blow
but
in
the
case
of
smith
there
was
no
killing
at
all
there
was
a
mere
with
intention
to
do
him
bodily
harm
this
latter
offence
was
not
a
crime
for
which
men
were
put
to
death
even
when
there
was
no
assault
or
attempt
at
assault
on
the
part
of
the
person
shot
at
this
was
not
a
crime
punished
with
death
until
that
terrible
act
brought
in
by
the
late
lord
ellenborough
was
passed
and
formed
a
part
of
our
matchless
code
that
code
which
there
is
such
a
talk
about
but
which
softening
does
not
appear
to
have
in
view
this
act
or
any
portion
of
the
in
order
to
form
a
just
opinion
with
regard
to
the
offence
of
these
two
men
that
have
been
hanged
at
winchester
we
must
first
consider
the
motives
by
which
they
were
actuated
in
committing
the
acts
of
violence
laid
to
their
charge
for
it
is
the
intention
and
not
the
mere
act
that
constitutes
the
crime
to
make
an
act
murder
there
must
be
the
question
therefore
is
did
these
men
attack
or
were
they
the
attacked
it
seems
to
be
clear
that
they
were
the
attacked
parties
for
they
are
executed
according
to
this
publication
to
deter
others
from
gamekeepers
i
know
very
well
that
there
is
law
for
this
but
what
i
shall
endeavour
to
show
is
that
the
law
ought
to
be
altered
that
the
people
of
hampshire
ought
to
petition
for
such
alteration
and
that
if
you
the
landlords
were
wise
you
would
petition
also
for
an
alteration
if
not
a
total
annihilation
of
that
terrible
code
called
the
which
has
been
growing
harder
and
harder
all
the
time
that
it
ought
to
have
been
wearing
away
it
should
never
be
forgotten
that
in
order
to
make
punishments
efficient
in
the
way
of
example
they
must
be
thought
just
by
the
community
at
large
and
they
will
never
be
thought
just
if
they
aim
at
the
protection
of
things
belonging
to
one
particular
class
of
the
community
and
especially
if
those
very
things
be
grudged
to
this
class
by
the
community
in
general
when
punishments
of
this
sort
take
place
they
are
looked
upon
as
unnecessary
the
sufferers
are
objects
of
pity
the
common
feeling
of
the
community
is
in
their
favour
instead
of
being
against
them
and
it
is
those
who
cause
the
punishment
and
not
those
who
suffer
it
who
become
objects
of
abhorrence
upon
seeing
two
of
our
countrymen
hanging
upon
a
gallows
we
naturally
and
instantly
run
back
to
the
cause
first
we
find
the
fighting
with
gamekeepers
next
we
find
that
the
men
would
have
been
transported
if
caught
in
or
near
a
cover
with
guns
after
dark
next
we
find
that
these
trespassers
are
exposed
to
transportation
because
they
are
in
pursuit
or
supposed
to
be
in
pursuit
of
partridges
pheasants
or
hares
and
then
we
ask
where
is
the
foundation
of
a
law
to
punish
a
man
with
transportation
for
being
in
pursuit
of
these
animals
and
where
indeed
is
the
foundation
of
the
law
to
take
from
any
man
be
he
who
he
may
the
right
of
catching
and
using
these
animals
we
know
very
well
we
are
instructed
by
mere
feeling
that
we
have
a
right
to
live
to
see
and
to
move
common
sense
tells
us
that
there
are
some
things
which
no
man
can
reasonably
call
his
property
and
though
poachers
as
they
are
called
do
not
read
they
know
that
such
animals
as
are
of
a
wild
and
untameable
disposition
any
man
may
seize
upon
and
keep
for
his
own
use
and
pleasure
all
these
things
so
long
as
they
remain
in
possession
every
man
has
a
right
to
enjoy
without
disturbance
but
if
once
they
escape
from
his
custody
or
he
voluntarily
abandons
the
use
of
them
they
return
to
the
common
stock
and
any
man
else
has
an
equal
right
to
seize
and
enjoy
them
afterwards
book
chapter
in
the
second
book
and
chapter
of
the
poacher
might
read
as
follows
with
regard
likewise
to
wild
animals
all
mankind
had
by
the
original
grant
of
the
creator
a
right
to
pursue
and
take
away
any
fowl
or
insect
of
the
air
any
fish
or
inhabitant
of
the
waters
and
any
beast
or
reptile
of
the
field
and
this
natural
right
still
continues
in
every
individual
unless
where
it
is
restrained
by
the
civil
laws
of
the
country
and
when
a
man
has
once
so
seized
them
they
become
while
living
his
qualified
property
or
if
dead
are
absolutely
his
own
so
that
to
steal
them
or
otherwise
invade
this
property
is
according
to
the
respective
values
sometimes
a
criminal
offence
sometimes
only
a
civil
injury
poachers
do
not
read
this
but
that
reason
which
is
common
to
all
mankind
tells
them
that
this
is
true
and
tells
them
also
to
of
any
positive
law
that
is
made
to
restrain
them
from
this
right
granted
by
the
creator
before
i
proceed
further
in
commenting
upon
the
case
immediately
before
me
let
me
once
more
quote
this
english
judge
who
wrote
fifty
years
ago
when
the
game
code
was
mild
indeed
compared
to
the
one
of
the
present
day
another
violent
alteration
says
he
of
the
english
constitution
consisted
in
the
depopulation
of
whole
countries
for
the
purposes
of
the
king
royal
diversion
and
subjecting
both
them
and
all
the
ancient
forests
of
the
kingdom
to
the
unreasonable
severities
of
forest
laws
imported
from
the
continent
whereby
the
slaughter
of
a
beast
was
made
almost
as
penal
as
the
death
of
a
man
in
the
saxon
times
though
no
man
was
allowed
to
kill
or
chase
the
king
deer
yet
he
might
start
any
game
pursue
and
kill
it
upon
his
own
estate
but
the
rigour
of
these
new
constitutions
vested
the
sole
property
of
all
the
game
in
england
in
the
king
alone
and
no
man
was
entitled
to
disturb
any
fowl
of
the
air
or
any
beast
of
the
field
of
such
kinds
as
were
specially
reserved
for
the
royal
amusement
of
the
sovereign
without
express
license
from
the
king
by
a
grant
of
a
chase
or
free
warren
and
those
franchises
were
granted
as
much
with
a
view
to
preserve
the
breed
of
animals
as
to
indulge
the
subject
from
a
similar
principle
to
which
though
the
forest
laws
are
now
mitigated
and
by
degrees
grown
entirely
obsolete
yet
from
this
root
has
sprung
up
a
bastard
slip
known
by
the
name
of
the
now
arrived
to
and
wantoning
in
its
highest
vigour
both
founded
upon
the
same
unreasonable
notions
of
permanent
property
in
wild
creatures
and
both
productive
of
the
same
tyranny
to
the
commons
but
with
this
difference
that
the
forest
laws
established
only
one
mighty
hunter
throughout
the
land
the
have
raised
a
little
nimrod
in
every
manor
book
chapter
when
this
was
written
nothing
was
known
of
the
present
severity
of
the
law
judge
blackstone
says
that
the
game
law
was
then
wantoning
in
its
what
then
would
he
have
said
if
any
one
had
proposed
to
make
it
to
resist
a
gamekeeper
he
calls
it
tyranny
to
the
commons
as
it
existed
in
his
time
what
would
he
have
said
of
the
present
code
which
so
far
from
being
thought
a
thing
to
be
is
never
so
much
as
mentioned
by
those
humane
and
gentle
creatures
who
are
absolutely
supporting
a
sort
of
reputation
and
aiming
at
distinction
in
society
in
consequence
of
their
incessant
talk
about
softening
the
criminal
code
the
law
may
say
what
it
will
but
the
feelings
of
mankind
will
never
be
in
favour
of
this
code
and
whenever
it
produces
putting
to
death
it
will
necessarily
excite
horror
it
is
impossible
to
make
men
believe
that
any
particular
set
of
individuals
should
have
a
permanent
property
in
wild
creatures
that
the
owner
of
land
should
have
a
quiet
possession
of
it
is
reasonable
and
right
and
necessary
it
is
also
necessary
that
he
should
have
the
power
of
inflicting
pecuniary
punishment
in
a
moderate
degree
upon
such
as
trespass
on
his
lands
but
his
right
can
go
no
further
according
to
reason
if
the
law
give
him
ample
compensation
for
every
damage
that
he
sustains
in
consequence
of
a
trespass
on
his
lands
what
right
has
he
to
complain
the
law
authorises
the
king
in
case
of
invasion
or
apprehended
invasion
to
call
upon
all
his
people
to
take
up
arms
in
defence
of
the
country
the
militia
law
compels
every
man
in
his
turn
to
become
a
soldier
and
upon
what
ground
is
this
there
must
be
some
reason
for
it
or
else
the
law
would
be
tyranny
the
reason
is
that
every
man
has
in
the
country
to
which
he
belongs
and
that
therefore
it
is
his
duty
to
defend
the
country
some
rights
too
beyond
that
of
merely
living
merely
that
of
breathing
the
air
and
then
i
should
be
glad
to
know
what
rights
an
englishman
has
if
the
pursuit
of
even
wild
animals
is
to
be
the
ground
of
transporting
him
from
his
country
there
is
a
sufficient
punishment
provided
by
the
law
of
trespass
quite
sufficient
means
to
keep
men
off
your
land
altogether
how
can
it
be
necessary
then
to
have
a
law
to
transport
them
for
coming
upon
your
land
no
it
is
not
for
coming
upon
the
land
it
is
for
coming
after
the
wild
animals
which
nature
and
reason
tells
them
are
as
much
theirs
as
they
are
yours
it
is
impossible
for
the
people
not
to
contrast
the
treatment
of
these
two
men
at
winchester
with
the
treatment
of
some
gamekeepers
that
have
killed
or
maimed
the
persons
they
call
poachers
and
it
is
equally
impossible
for
the
people
when
they
see
these
two
men
hanging
on
a
gallows
after
being
recommended
to
mercy
not
to
remember
the
almost
instant
pardon
given
to
the
exciseman
who
was
not
recommended
to
mercy
and
who
was
found
guilty
of
wilful
murder
in
the
county
of
sussex
it
is
said
and
i
believe
truly
that
there
are
more
persons
imprisoned
in
england
for
offences
against
the
than
there
are
persons
imprisoned
in
france
with
more
than
twice
the
population
for
all
sorts
of
offences
put
together
when
there
was
a
loud
outcry
against
the
cruelties
committed
on
the
priests
and
the
seigneurs
by
the
people
of
france
arthur
young
bade
them
remember
the
cruelties
committed
on
the
people
by
the
and
to
bear
in
mind
how
many
had
been
made
for
having
killed
or
tried
to
kill
partridges
pheasants
and
hares
however
i
am
aware
that
it
is
quite
useless
to
address
observations
of
this
sort
to
you
i
am
quite
aware
of
that
and
yet
there
are
circumstances
in
your
present
situation
which
one
would
think
ought
to
make
you
very
upon
the
hanging
of
the
two
men
at
winchester
it
delights
me
i
assure
you
to
see
the
situation
that
you
are
in
and
i
shall
therefore
now
once
more
and
for
the
last
time
address
you
upon
that
subject
we
all
remember
how
haughty
how
insolent
you
have
been
we
all
bear
in
mind
your
conduct
for
the
last
years
and
the
feeling
of
pleasure
at
your
present
state
is
as
general
as
it
is
just
in
my
to
you
i
told
you
that
you
would
lose
your
estates
those
of
you
who
have
any
capacity
except
that
which
is
necessary
to
enable
you
to
kill
wild
animals
see
this
now
as
clearly
as
i
do
and
yet
you
evince
no
intention
to
change
your
courses
you
hang
on
with
unrelenting
grasp
and
cry
pauper
and
poacher
and
radical
and
lower
orders
with
as
much
insolence
as
ever
it
is
always
thus
men
like
you
may
be
convinced
of
error
but
they
never
change
their
conduct
they
never
become
just
because
they
are
convinced
that
they
have
been
unjust
they
must
have
a
great
deal
more
than
that
conviction
to
make
them
just
such
was
what
i
addressed
to
the
landlords
how
well
it
fits
the
time
they
are
just
in
the
same
sort
of
now
that
they
were
in
but
there
is
this
most
important
difference
that
the
can
not
be
put
out
in
a
quantity
sufficient
to
save
them
without
producing
not
only
a
panic
worse
than
the
last
but
in
all
probability
a
total
blowing
up
of
the
whole
system
new
sunday
tolls
and
laws
laws
laws
and
all
the
whole
thing
root
and
trunk
and
branch
aye
not
sparing
perhaps
even
the
tent
or
booth
of
induction
at
draycot
foliot
good
lord
how
should
we
be
able
to
live
without
and
then
and
how
should
we
get
on
without
pensions
sinecures
tithes
and
the
other
glorious
institutions
of
this
mighty
let
us
turn
however
from
the
thought
but
bearing
this
in
mind
if
you
please
messieurs
the
that
if
no
matter
in
what
shape
and
under
what
pretence
if
i
tell
you
paper
be
put
out
again
sufficient
to
raise
the
price
of
a
southdown
ewe
to
the
last
year
mark
the
whole
system
goes
to
atoms
i
tell
you
that
mind
it
and
look
sharp
about
you
o
ye
fat
parsons
for
tithes
and
will
be
you
assured
never
from
that
day
again
go
in
company
into
parson
pocket
in
this
north
of
hampshire
as
everywhere
else
the
churches
and
all
other
things
exhibit
indubitable
marks
of
decay
there
are
along
under
the
north
side
of
that
chain
of
hills
which
divide
hampshire
from
berkshire
in
this
part
taking
into
hampshire
about
two
or
three
miles
wide
of
the
low
ground
along
under
the
chain
eleven
churches
along
in
a
string
in
about
fifteen
miles
the
chancels
of
which
would
contain
a
great
many
more
than
all
the
inhabitants
men
women
and
children
sitting
at
their
ease
with
plenty
of
room
how
should
this
be
otherwise
when
in
the
parish
of
burghclere
one
single
farmer
holds
by
lease
under
lord
carnarvon
as
one
farm
the
lands
that
men
now
living
can
remember
to
have
formed
fourteen
farms
bringing
up
in
a
respectable
way
fourteen
families
in
some
instances
these
small
farmhouses
and
homesteads
are
completely
gone
in
others
the
buildings
remain
but
in
a
state
in
others
the
house
is
gone
leaving
the
barn
for
use
as
a
barn
or
as
a
in
others
the
are
gone
and
the
house
with
rotten
thatch
broken
windows
rotten
and
all
threatening
to
fall
remains
as
the
dwelling
of
a
and
ragged
family
of
labourers
the
perhaps
of
the
decent
family
of
small
farmers
that
formerly
lived
happily
in
this
very
house
this
with
few
exceptions
is
the
case
all
over
england
and
if
we
duly
consider
the
nature
and
tendency
of
the
hellish
system
of
taxing
of
funding
and
of
it
must
do
so
then
in
this
very
parish
of
burghclere
there
was
until
a
few
months
ago
a
famous
the
honourable
and
reverend
george
herbert
who
had
grafted
the
upon
the
and
the
upon
the
parson
for
he
died
a
little
while
ago
a
officer
in
the
army
rector
of
two
parishes
and
chairman
of
the
quarter
sessions
of
the
county
of
hants
hone
gave
us
in
his
memorable
that
jack
a
portrait
of
the
clerical
magistrate
could
not
he
or
somebody
else
give
us
a
portrait
of
the
and
of
the
for
such
are
to
be
found
all
over
the
kingdom
wherever
i
go
i
hear
of
them
and
yet
there
sits
burdett
and
even
sir
bobby
of
the
borough
and
say
not
a
word
upon
the
subject
this
is
the
case
the
king
dismissed
sir
bobby
from
the
list
scratched
his
name
out
turned
him
off
stopped
his
pay
sir
bobby
complained
alleging
that
the
was
a
reward
for
past
services
no
no
said
the
ministers
it
is
a
for
services
now
the
law
is
and
the
parliament
declared
in
the
case
of
parson
horne
tooke
that
once
a
parson
always
a
parson
and
that
a
parson
can
not
of
course
again
serve
as
an
officer
under
the
crown
yet
these
military
and
naval
parsons
have
a
retaining
fee
for
future
military
and
naval
services
never
was
so
barefaced
a
thing
before
heard
of
in
the
world
and
yet
there
sits
sir
bobby
stripped
of
his
retaining
fee
and
says
not
a
word
about
the
matter
and
there
sit
the
who
gave
sir
bobby
the
subscription
having
sons
brothers
and
other
relations
military
and
naval
parsons
and
the
of
course
bid
sir
bobby
albeit
given
enough
to
twattle
hold
his
tongue
upon
the
subject
and
there
sit
wetherspoon
i
think
it
is
and
the
rest
of
sir
bobby
rump
toasting
the
of
the
borough
and
its
member
that
our
case
as
the
lawyers
say
match
it
if
you
can
devil
in
all
your
roamings
up
and
down
throughout
the
earth
i
have
often
been
thinking
and
indeed
expecting
to
see
sir
bobby
turn
parson
himself
as
the
likeliest
way
to
get
back
his
if
he
should
have
a
call
i
do
hope
we
shall
have
him
for
parson
at
kensington
and
as
an
inducement
i
promise
him
that
i
will
give
him
a
good
thumping
in
former
rides
and
especially
in
and
i
described
very
fully
this
part
of
hampshire
the
land
is
a
chalk
bottom
with
a
bed
of
reddish
stiff
loam
full
of
flints
at
top
in
those
parts
where
the
bed
of
loam
and
flints
is
deep
the
land
is
arable
or
woods
where
the
bed
of
loam
and
flints
is
so
shallow
as
to
let
the
plough
down
to
the
chalk
the
surface
is
downs
in
the
deep
and
long
valleys
where
there
is
constantly
or
occasionally
a
stream
of
water
the
top
soil
is
blackish
and
the
surface
meadows
this
has
been
the
distribution
from
all
antiquity
except
that
in
ancient
times
part
of
that
which
is
now
downs
and
woods
was
as
we
know
from
the
of
the
and
yet
the
scotch
fellows
would
persuade
us
that
there
were
scarcely
any
inhabitants
in
england
before
it
had
the
unspeakable
happiness
to
be
united
to
that
fertile
warm
and
hospitable
country
where
the
people
are
so
well
off
that
they
are
having
the
tops
of
the
hills
here
are
as
good
as
any
other
part
and
it
is
all
excellent
and
the
fields
and
woods
singularly
beautiful
never
was
there
what
may
be
called
a
more
country
and
in
coming
from
burghclere
you
come
up
nearly
a
mile
of
steep
hill
from
the
top
of
which
you
can
see
all
over
the
country
even
to
the
isle
of
wight
to
your
right
a
great
part
of
wiltshire
into
surrey
on
your
left
and
turning
round
you
see
lying
below
you
the
whole
of
berkshire
great
part
of
oxfordshire
and
part
of
gloucestershire
this
chain
of
lofty
hills
was
a
great
favourite
with
kings
and
rulers
in
ancient
times
at
highclere
at
combe
and
at
other
places
there
are
remains
of
great
encampments
or
fortifications
and
kingsclere
was
a
residence
of
the
saxon
kings
and
continued
to
be
a
royal
residence
long
after
the
norman
kings
came
king
john
when
residing
at
kingsclere
founded
one
of
the
charities
which
still
exists
in
the
town
of
newbury
which
is
but
a
few
miles
from
kingsclere
from
the
top
of
this
lofty
chain
you
come
to
uphusband
or
the
upper
hurstbourn
over
two
miles
or
more
of
ground
descending
in
the
way
that
the
body
of
a
snake
descends
when
he
is
going
fast
from
the
high
part
near
the
head
down
to
the
tail
that
is
to
say
over
a
series
of
hill
and
dell
but
the
dell
part
going
constantly
on
increasing
upon
the
hilly
part
till
you
come
down
to
this
village
and
then
you
continuing
on
southward
towards
andover
go
up
directly
half
a
mile
of
hill
so
steep
as
to
make
it
very
difficult
for
an
ordinary
team
with
a
load
to
take
that
load
up
it
so
this
called
so
because
up
the
than
the
other
hurstbourns
the
flat
part
of
the
road
to
which
from
the
north
comes
in
between
two
is
in
as
narrow
and
deep
a
dell
as
any
place
that
i
ever
saw
the
houses
of
the
village
are
in
great
part
scattered
about
and
are
amongst
very
lofty
and
fine
trees
and
from
many
many
points
round
about
from
the
hilly
fields
now
covered
with
the
young
wheat
or
with
scarcely
less
beautiful
sainfoin
the
village
is
a
sight
worth
going
many
miles
to
see
the
lands
too
are
pretty
beyond
description
these
chains
of
hills
make
below
them
an
endless
number
of
lower
hills
of
varying
shapes
and
sizes
and
aspects
and
of
relative
state
as
to
each
other
while
the
surface
presents
in
the
size
and
form
of
the
fields
in
the
woods
the
hedgerows
the
sainfoin
the
young
wheat
the
turnips
the
tares
the
fallows
the
and
the
flocks
and
at
every
turn
of
your
head
a
fresh
and
different
set
of
these
this
surface
all
together
presents
that
which
i
at
any
rate
could
look
at
with
pleasure
for
ever
not
a
sort
of
country
that
i
like
so
well
as
when
there
are
and
a
and
of
but
a
sort
of
country
that
i
like
next
to
that
for
here
as
there
there
are
no
ditches
no
no
dirt
and
never
any
drought
to
cause
inconvenience
the
chalk
is
at
bottom
and
it
takes
care
of
all
the
crops
of
wheat
have
been
very
good
here
this
year
and
those
of
barley
not
very
bad
the
sainfoin
has
given
a
fine
crop
of
the
finest
sort
of
hay
in
the
world
and
this
year
without
a
drop
of
wet
i
wish
that
in
speaking
of
this
pretty
village
which
i
always
return
to
with
additional
pleasure
i
could
give
good
of
the
state
of
without
whose
labour
there
would
be
neither
corn
nor
sainfoin
nor
i
regret
to
say
that
my
account
of
this
matter
if
i
give
it
truly
must
be
a
dismal
account
indeed
for
i
have
in
no
part
of
england
seen
the
labouring
people
so
badly
off
as
they
are
here
this
has
made
so
much
impression
on
me
that
i
shall
enter
fully
into
the
matter
with
names
dates
and
all
the
particulars
in
the
ivth
number
of
the
poor
man
friend
this
is
one
of
the
great
purposes
for
which
i
take
these
rides
i
am
persuaded
that
before
the
day
shall
come
when
my
labours
must
cease
shall
have
mended
the
meals
of
i
may
the
effects
of
my
endeavours
but
this
being
my
persuasion
i
should
be
guilty
of
a
great
neglect
of
duty
were
i
not
to
use
those
endeavours
sunday
i
went
to
weyhill
yesterday
to
see
the
close
of
the
hop
and
of
the
cheese
fair
for
after
the
sheep
these
are
the
principal
articles
the
crop
of
hops
has
been
in
parts
where
they
are
grown
unusually
large
and
of
quality
the
average
price
of
the
farnham
has
been
as
nearly
as
i
can
ascertain
seven
pounds
for
a
hundredweight
that
of
kentish
hops
five
pounds
and
that
of
the
hampshire
and
surrey
hops
other
than
those
of
farnham
about
five
pounds
also
the
prices
are
considering
the
great
weight
of
the
crop
very
good
but
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
effects
of
panic
proceeding
as
baring
said
from
a
plethora
of
money
these
prices
would
have
been
a
full
third
if
not
nearly
one
half
higher
for
though
the
crop
has
been
so
large
and
so
good
there
was
hardly
any
stock
on
hand
the
country
was
almost
wholly
without
hops
as
to
cheese
the
price
considering
the
quantity
has
been
not
one
half
so
high
as
it
was
last
year
the
fall
in
the
positive
price
has
been
about
per
and
the
quantity
made
in
has
not
been
above
as
great
as
that
made
in
so
that
here
is
a
fall
of
in
real
relative
price
that
is
to
say
the
farmer
while
he
has
the
same
rent
to
pay
that
he
paid
last
year
has
only
half
as
much
money
to
receive
for
cheese
as
he
received
for
cheese
last
year
and
observe
on
some
farms
cheese
is
almost
the
only
saleable
produce
after
the
fair
was
over
yesterday
i
came
down
from
the
hill
miles
to
this
town
of
andover
which
has
within
the
last
days
been
more
talked
of
in
other
parts
of
the
kingdom
than
it
ever
was
before
from
the
creation
of
the
world
to
the
beginning
of
those
days
the
thomas
asheton
smiths
and
the
sir
john
pollens
famous
as
they
have
been
under
the
banners
of
the
old
navy
purser
george
rose
and
his
successors
have
never
even
since
the
death
of
poor
turner
been
half
so
famous
they
and
this
corporation
whom
they
represent
as
they
have
been
since
the
meeting
which
they
held
here
which
ended
in
their
defeat
and
confusion
pointing
them
out
as
worthy
of
that
appellation
of
poor
devils
which
pollen
thought
proper
to
give
to
those
labourers
without
whose
toil
his
estate
would
not
be
worth
a
single
farthing
having
laid
my
plan
to
sleep
at
andover
last
night
i
went
with
two
farnham
friends
knowles
and
west
to
dine
at
the
ordinary
at
the
george
inn
which
is
kept
by
one
sutton
a
rich
old
fellow
who
wore
a
sleeved
fustian
waistcoat
with
a
dirty
white
apron
tied
round
his
middle
and
with
no
coat
on
having
a
look
the
and
the
that
i
ever
saw
in
any
set
of
features
in
my
whole
having
an
air
of
authority
and
of
mastership
which
to
a
stranger
as
i
was
seemed
quite
incompatible
with
the
meanness
of
his
dress
and
the
vulgarity
of
his
manners
and
there
being
visible
to
every
beholder
constantly
going
on
in
him
a
pretty
even
contest
between
the
servility
of
avarice
and
the
insolence
of
wealth
a
great
part
of
the
farmers
and
other
having
gone
off
home
we
found
preparations
made
for
dining
only
about
ten
people
but
after
we
sat
down
and
it
was
seen
that
we
designed
to
dine
guests
came
in
apace
the
preparations
were
augmented
and
as
many
as
could
dine
came
and
dined
with
us
after
the
dinner
was
over
the
room
became
fuller
and
fuller
guests
came
in
from
the
other
inns
where
they
had
been
dining
till
at
last
the
room
became
as
full
as
possible
in
every
part
the
door
being
opened
the
blocked
up
and
the
stairs
leading
to
the
room
crammed
from
bottom
to
top
in
this
state
of
things
knowles
who
was
our
chairman
gave
which
of
course
was
followed
by
a
and
as
the
reader
will
readily
suppose
to
have
an
opportunity
of
making
a
speech
was
the
main
motive
for
my
going
to
dine
at
at
any
hour
and
especially
at
at
night
in
this
speech
i
after
descanting
on
the
present
devastating
ruin
and
on
those
successive
acts
of
the
ministers
and
the
parliament
by
which
such
ruin
had
been
produced
after
remarking
on
the
shuffling
the
tricks
the
contrivances
from
up
to
last
march
i
proceeded
to
offer
to
the
company
for
believing
that
no
attempt
would
be
made
to
relieve
the
farmers
and
others
by
putting
out
the
again
as
in
or
by
a
just
as
i
was
stating
these
my
reasons
on
a
prospective
matter
of
such
deep
interest
to
my
hearers
amongst
whom
were
cattle
and
sheep
dealers
hop
and
cheese
producers
and
merchants
and
even
one
two
or
more
country
bankers
just
as
i
was
engaged
in
stating
for
my
opinion
on
a
matter
of
such
vital
importance
to
the
parties
present
who
were
all
listening
to
me
with
the
greatest
attention
just
at
this
time
a
noise
was
heard
and
a
sort
of
row
was
taking
place
in
the
passage
the
cause
of
which
was
upon
inquiry
found
to
be
no
less
a
personage
than
our
landlord
our
host
sutton
who
it
appeared
finding
that
my
had
cut
off
or
at
least
suspended
all
intercourse
between
the
dining
now
become
a
drinking
room
and
the
who
finding
that
i
had
been
the
cause
of
a
great
restriction
in
the
exchange
of
our
money
for
his
neat
genuine
commodities
downstairs
and
being
apparently
an
ardent
admirer
of
the
liberal
system
of
free
trade
who
finding
in
short
or
rather
supposing
that
if
my
tongue
were
not
stopped
from
running
his
taps
would
be
had
though
an
old
man
fought
or
at
least
forced
his
way
up
the
thronged
stairs
and
through
the
passage
and
into
the
room
and
was
with
what
breath
the
struggle
had
left
him
beginning
to
bawl
out
to
me
when
some
one
called
to
him
and
told
him
that
he
was
causing
an
interruption
to
which
he
answered
that
that
was
what
he
had
come
to
do
and
then
he
went
on
to
say
in
so
many
words
that
my
speech
injured
his
sale
of
liquor
the
disgust
and
abhorrence
which
such
conduct
could
not
fail
to
excite
produced
at
first
a
desire
to
quit
the
room
and
the
house
and
even
a
proposition
to
that
effect
but
after
a
minute
or
so
to
reflect
the
company
resolved
not
to
quit
the
room
but
to
turn
him
out
of
it
who
had
caused
the
interruption
and
the
old
fellow
finding
himself
saved
the
labour
of
shoving
or
kicking
him
out
of
the
room
by
retreating
out
of
the
with
all
the
activity
of
which
he
was
master
after
this
i
proceeded
with
my
and
this
being
ended
the
great
business
of
the
evening
namely
drinking
smoking
and
singing
was
about
to
be
proceeded
in
by
a
company
who
had
just
closed
an
arduous
and
anxious
week
who
had
before
them
a
sunday
morning
to
sleep
in
and
whose
wives
were
for
the
far
greater
part
at
a
convenient
distance
an
assemblage
of
circumstances
more
auspicious
to
free
trade
in
the
neat
and
genuine
has
seldom
occurred
but
now
behold
the
old
fellow
whose
head
was
i
think
took
it
into
that
head
not
only
to
lay
restrictions
upon
trade
but
to
impose
an
absolute
embargo
cut
off
entirely
all
supplies
whatever
from
his
bar
to
the
room
long
as
i
remained
in
that
a
message
to
this
effect
from
the
old
fustian
man
having
been
through
the
waiter
communicated
to
knowles
and
he
having
communicated
it
to
the
company
i
addressed
the
company
in
nearly
these
words
gentlemen
born
and
bred
as
you
know
i
was
on
the
borders
of
this
county
and
fond
as
i
am
of
bacon
have
with
me
always
been
objects
of
admiration
rather
than
of
contempt
but
that
which
has
just
happened
here
induces
me
to
observe
that
this
feeling
of
mine
has
been
confined
to
hogs
of
for
my
part
i
like
your
company
too
well
to
quit
it
i
have
paid
this
fellow
for
the
wing
of
a
fowl
a
bit
of
bread
and
a
pint
of
small
beer
i
have
a
right
to
sit
here
i
want
no
drink
and
those
who
do
being
refused
it
here
have
a
right
to
send
to
other
houses
for
it
and
to
drink
it
here
however
mammon
soon
got
the
upper
hand
downstairs
all
the
fondness
for
free
trade
returned
and
up
came
the
old
fellow
bringing
pipes
tobacco
wine
grog
sling
and
seeming
to
be
as
pleased
as
if
he
had
just
sprung
a
mine
of
gold
nay
he
soon
after
this
came
into
the
room
with
two
gentlemen
who
had
come
to
him
to
ask
where
i
was
he
actually
came
up
to
me
making
me
a
bow
and
telling
me
that
those
gentlemen
wished
to
be
introduced
to
me
he
with
a
fawning
look
laid
his
hand
upon
my
knee
take
away
your
said
i
and
shaking
the
gentlemen
by
the
hand
i
said
i
am
happy
to
see
you
gentlemen
even
though
introduced
by
this
fellow
things
now
proceeded
without
interruption
songs
toasts
and
speeches
filled
up
the
time
until
two
this
morning
though
in
the
house
of
a
landlord
who
receives
the
sacrament
but
who
from
his
manifestly
ardent
attachment
to
the
liberal
principles
of
free
trade
would
i
have
no
doubt
have
suffered
us
if
we
could
have
found
money
and
throats
and
stomachs
to
sit
and
sing
and
talk
and
drink
until
two
of
a
sunday
afternoon
instead
of
two
of
a
sunday
morning
it
was
not
politics
it
was
not
dislike
to
me
for
the
fellow
knew
nothing
of
me
it
was
as
i
told
the
company
just
this
he
looked
upon
their
bodies
as
so
many
gutters
to
drain
off
the
contents
of
his
taps
and
upon
their
purses
as
so
many
small
heaps
from
which
to
take
the
means
of
augmenting
his
great
one
and
finding
that
i
had
been
no
matter
how
the
cause
of
suspending
this
work
of
reciprocity
he
wanted
and
no
matter
how
to
restore
the
reciprocal
system
to
motion
all
that
i
have
to
add
is
this
that
the
next
time
this
old
fellow
gets
from
me
for
a
dinner
he
shall
if
he
choose
in
any
manner
that
he
likes
and
season
me
with
hand
so
unsparing
as
to
produce
in
the
feeders
thirst
unquenchable
morning
we
set
off
for
the
new
forest
and
indeed
we
have
lounged
about
here
long
enough
but
as
some
apology
i
have
to
state
that
while
i
have
been
in
a
sort
of
waiting
upon
this
great
fair
where
one
hears
sees
and
learns
so
much
i
have
been
writing
no
iv
of
the
man
which
price
twopence
is
published
once
a
month
i
see
in
the
london
newspapers
accounts
of
from
i
thought
that
he
went
solely
on
a
party
of
pleasure
so
the
dispatches
come
to
tell
the
king
how
the
pleasure
party
gets
on
no
what
he
is
gone
to
paris
for
is
to
endeavour
to
prevent
the
allies
from
doing
anything
which
shall
sink
the
english
government
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
and
favour
the
who
are
enemies
of
regular
government
and
whose
success
in
england
would
in
france
this
is
my
opinion
the
subject
if
i
be
right
in
my
opinion
was
too
ticklish
to
be
committed
to
paper
granville
levison
gower
for
that
is
the
man
that
is
now
lord
granville
was
perhaps
not
thought
quite
a
match
for
the
french
as
and
therefore
the
captain
of
eton
who
in
said
that
the
ever
living
luminary
of
british
prosperity
was
only
hidden
behind
a
cloud
and
who
in
said
that
peel
bill
had
set
the
currency
question
at
rest
for
ever
therefore
the
profound
captain
is
gone
over
to
see
what
can
do
but
captain
a
word
in
your
ear
we
do
not
care
for
the
bourbons
any
more
than
we
do
for
you
my
real
opinion
is
that
there
is
nothing
that
can
put
england
to
rights
that
will
not
shake
the
bourbon
government
this
is
my
opinion
but
i
defy
the
bourbons
to
save
or
to
assist
in
saving
the
present
system
in
england
unless
they
and
their
friends
will
subscribe
and
pay
off
your
debt
for
you
captain
of
and
nonsensical
and
eton
let
them
pay
off
your
debt
for
you
captain
let
the
bourbons
and
their
allies
do
that
or
they
can
not
save
you
no
nor
can
they
help
you
even
in
the
smallest
degree

monday
noon
like
a
very
great
fool
i
out
of
senseless
complaisance
waited
this
morning
to
breakfast
with
the
friends
at
whose
house
we
slept
last
night
at
andover
we
thus
lost
two
hours
of
dry
weather
and
have
been
justly
punished
by
about
an
hour
ride
in
the
rain
i
settled
on
lyndhurst
as
the
place
to
lodge
at
so
we
are
here
feeding
our
horses
drying
our
clothes
and
writing
the
account
of
our
journey
we
came
as
much
as
possible
all
the
way
through
the
villages
and
almost
all
the
way
avoided
the
from
andover
to
stockbridge
about
seven
or
eight
miles
is
for
the
greatest
part
an
open
corn
and
sheep
country
a
considerable
portion
of
the
land
being
downs
the
wheat
and
rye
and
vetch
and
sainfoin
fields
look
beautiful
here
and
during
the
whole
of
the
way
from
andover
to
rumsey
the
early
turnips
of
both
kinds
are
not
bad
and
the
stubble
turnips
very
promising
the
downs
are
green
as
meadows
usually
are
in
april
the
grass
is
most
abundant
in
all
situations
where
grass
grows
from
stockbridge
to
rumsey
we
came
nearly
by
the
river
side
and
had
to
cross
the
river
several
times
this
the
river
teste
which
as
i
described
in
my
ride
of
last
november
begins
at
uphusband
by
springs
bubbling
up
in
march
out
of
the
bed
of
that
deep
valley
it
is
at
first
a
bourn
that
is
to
say
a
stream
that
runs
only
a
part
of
the
year
and
is
the
rest
of
the
year
as
dry
as
a
road
about
miles
from
this
periodical
source
it
becomes
a
stream
all
the
year
round
after
winding
about
between
the
chalk
hills
for
many
miles
first
in
a
general
direction
towards
the
and
then
in
a
similar
direction
towards
the
and
south
it
is
joined
by
the
little
stream
that
rises
just
above
and
that
passes
through
the
town
of
andover
it
is
after
this
joined
by
several
other
little
streams
with
names
and
here
at
rumsey
it
is
a
large
and
very
fine
river
famous
all
the
way
down
for
trout
and
eels
and
both
of
the
finest
quality

monday
evening
i
have
just
time
before
i
go
to
bed
to
observe
that
we
arrived
here
about
over
about
or
miles
of
the
best
road
in
the
world
having
a
choice
too
for
the
great
part
of
the
way
between
these
smooth
roads
and
green
sward
just
as
we
came
out
of
rumsey
or
romsey
and
crossed
our
river
teste
once
more
we
saw
to
our
left
the
sort
of
park
called
where
poor
charles
smith
who
as
mentioned
above
was
hanged
for
one
snellgrove
an
of
lord
palmerston
who
was
then
our
secretary
at
war
and
who
is
in
that
office
i
believe
now
though
he
is
now
better
known
as
a
director
of
the
grand
mining
company
which
shows
the
great
of
this
noble
and
right
honourable
person
and
also
the
great
scope
and
the
various
nature
and
tendency
of
his
talents
what
would
our
old
fathers
of
the
dark
ages
have
said
if
they
had
been
told
that
their
descendants
would
at
last
become
so
enlightened
as
to
enable
jews
and
to
take
away
noblemen
estates
by
mere
watching
the
turn

to
cause

at

one

of
that
most
honourable
noble

reverend
assembly

privy
council
in
which
he
himself
sits
so
i
say
as
to
cause
one
of
this
most
honourable
and
reverend
body
to
become
a
director
in
a
mining
speculation
how
one
our
poor
bigoted
ancestors
who
would
i
dare
say
have
been
as
ready
to
a
man
for

such
a
liberal

as
this

wednesday
yesterday
from
lyndhurst
to
this
place
was
a
ride
including
our
of
more
than
forty
miles
but
the
roads
the
best
in
the
world
one
half
of
the
way
green
turf
and
the
day
as
fine
an
one
as
ever
came
out
of
the
heavens
we
took
in
a
breakfast
calculated
for
a
long
day
work
and
for
no
more
eating
till
night
we
had
slept
in
a
room
the
access
to
which
was
only
through
another
sleeping
room
which
was
also
occupied
and
as
i
had
got
up
about
at
andover
we
went
to
bed
at
lyndhurst
about
i
was
of
course
awake
by
three
or
four
i
had
eaten
little
over
night
so
that
here
lay
i
not
liking
even
after
began
to
glimmer
to
go
through
a
chamber
where
by
possibility
there
might
be
a
lady
actually
here
lay
i
my
bones
aching
with
lying
in
bed
my
stomach
growling
for
victuals
imprisoned
by
my
but
at
last
i
grew
impatient
for
modesty
here
or
modesty
there
i
was
not
to
be
penned
up
and
starved
so
after
having
shaved
and
dressed
and
got
ready
to
go
down
i
thrusted
george
out
a
little
before
me
into
the
other
room
and
through
we
pushed
previously
resolving
of
course
not
to
look
towards
that
was
there
but
as
the
devil
would
have
it
just
as
i
was
about
the
middle
of
the
room
i
like
lot
wife
turned
my
head
all
that
i
shall
say
is
first
that
the
consequences
that
befel
her
did
not
befal
me
and
second
that
i
advise
those
who
are
likely
to
be
hungry
in
the
morning
not
to
sleep
in
or
if
they
do
to
take
some
bread
and
cheese
in
their
pockets
having
got
safe
downstairs
i
lost
no
time
in
inquiry
after
the
means
of
obtaining
a
breakfast
to
make
up
for
the
bad
fare
of
the
previous
day
and
finding
my
landlady
rather
tardy
in
the
work
and
not
seemingly
having
a
proper
notion
of
the
affair
i
went
myself
and
having
found
a
butcher
shop
bought
a
loin
of
small
fat
wether
mutton
which
i
saw
cut
out
of
the
sheep
and
cut
into
chops
these
were
brought
to
the
inn
george
and
i
ate
about
out
of
the
and
while
i
was
writing
a
letter
and
making
up
my
packet
to
be
ready
to
send
from
southampton
george
went
out
and
found
a
poor
woman
to
come
and
take
away
the
rest
of
the
loin
of
mutton
for
our
of
the
day
before
enabled
us
to
do
this
and
though
we
had
about
forty
miles
to
go
to
get
to
this
place
through
the
route
that
we
intended
to
take
i
had
resolved
that
we
would
go
without
any
more
of
victuals
and
drink
this
day
also
i
beg
leave
to
suggest
to
my
readers
i
mean
those
who
have
at
their
command
more
victuals
and
drink
than
they
can
possibly
swallow
i
beg
to
suggest
to
such
whether
this
would
not
be
a
good
way
for
them
all
to
find
the
means
of
bestowing
charity
some
poet
has
said
that
that
which
is
given
in
gives
a
blessing
on
both
sides
to
the
giver
as
well
as
the
receiver
but
i
really
think
that
if
the
food
and
drink
given
came
out
of
food
and
drink
from
the
usual
quantity
swallowed
by
the
giver
the
would
be
still
greater
and
much
more
certain
i
can
speak
for
myself
at
any
rate
i
hardly
ever
eat
more
than
a
day
when
at
home
never
and
i
never
if
i
can
well
avoid
it
eat
any
meat
later
than
about
one
or
two
in
the
day
i
drink
a
little
tea
or
milk
and
water
at
the
usual
about
i
go
to
bed
at
eight
if
i
can
i
write
or
read
from
about
four
to
about
eight
and
then
hungry
as
a
hunter
i
go
to
breakfast
eating
small
a
of
cold
meat
and
bread
as
i
can
prevail
upon
my
teeth
to
be
satisfied
with
i
do
just
the
same
at
dinner
time
i
very
rarely
taste
of
any
sort
if
any
man
can
show
me
that
he
has
done
or
can
do
bodily
and
mentally
united
i
say
nothing
about
good
health
for
of
that
the
public
can
know
nothing
but
i
refer
to
the
public
know
they
see
what
i
can
do
and
what
i
actually
have
done
and
what
i
do
and
when
any
one
has
shown
the
public
that
he
has
done
or
can
do
more
then
i
will
advise
my
readers
attend
to
him
on
the
subject
of
diet
and
not
to
me
as
to
the
less
the
better
and
mine
is
milk
and
water
or
small
beer
if
i
can
get
the
latter
for
the
former
i
always
can
i
like
the
milk
and
water
best
but
i
do
not
like
much
water
and
if
i
drink
much
milk
it
loads
and
stupefies
and
makes
me
fat
having
made
all
preparations
for
a
day
ride
we
set
off
as
our
first
point
for
a
station
in
the
forest
called
new
park
there
to
see
something
about
and
other
matters
connected
with
the
affairs
of
our
prime
cocks
the
surveyors
of
woods
and
forests
and
crown
lands
and
estates
but
before
i
go
forward
any
further
i
must
just
step
back
again
to
rumsey
which
we
passed
rather
too
hastily
through
on
the
as
noticed
in
the
ride
that
was
published
last
week
this
town
was
in
ancient
times
a
very
grand
place
though
it
is
now
nothing
more
than
a
decent
without
anything
to
entitle
it
to
particular
notice
except
its
church
which
was
the
church
of
an
abbey
nunnery
founded
more
i
think
than
a
thousand
years
ago
and
which
church
was
the
burial
place
of
several
of
the
saxon
kings
and
of
lady
palmerstone
who
a
few
years
ago
died
in
what
a
mixture
but
there
was
another
personage
buried
here
and
who
was
it
would
seem
a
native
of
the
place
namely
sir
william
petty
the
ancestor
of
the
present
marquis
of
lansdown
he
was
the
son
of
and
was
doubtless
himself
a
weaver
when
young
he
became
a
surgeon
was
first
in
the
service
of
charles
then
went
into
that
of
cromwell
whom
he
served
as
to
his
army
in
ireland
alas
poor
ireland
and
in
this
capacity
he
resided
at
dublin
till
charles
ii
came
when
he
came
over
to
london
having
become
very
rich
was
knighted
by
that
profligate
and
ungrateful
king
and
he
died
in
leaving
a
fortune
of
a
year
this
is
what
his
biographers
say
he
must
have
made
pretty
good
use
of
his
time
while
to
cromwell
army
in
poor
ireland
by
nature
as
well
as
by
name
he
got
from
cromwell
a
patent
for
invented
by
him
and
he
invented
a
ship
to
sail
against
wind
and
a
model
of
which
is
still
preserved
in
the
library
of
the
royal
society
of
which
he
was
a
most
worthy
member
his
great
art
was
however
the
amassing
of
money
and
the
getting
of
of
lands
in
poor
in
which
he
was
one
of
the
most
successful
of
the
english
adventurers
i
had
the
other
day
occasion
to
observe
that
the
word
manifestly
is
the
french
word
which
means
and
that
it
is
in
these
days
of
degeneracy
pleasing
to
reflect
that
there
is
at
any
rate
that
old
england
still
boasts
one
family
which
retains
the
character
designated
by
its
pristine
name
a
reflection
that
rushed
with
great
force
into
my
mind
when
in
the
year
i
heard
the
present
noble
head
of
the
family
say
in
the
house
of
lords
that
he
thought
that
a
currency
of
paper
convertible
into
gold
was
the
best
and
most
solid
and
safe
especially
since
had
been
discovered
oh
god
exclaimed
i
to
myself
as
i
stood
listening
and
admiring
below
the
bar
oh
great
god
there
it
is
there
it
is
still
running
in
the
blood
that
genius
which
discovered
the
art
of
double
writing
and
of
making
ships
with
to
sail
against
wind
and
tide
this
noble
and
profound
descendant
of
cromwell
has
now
seen
that
paper
convertible
into
gold
is
not
quite
so
solid
and
safe
as
he
thought
it
was
he
has
now
seen
what
a
late
panic
is
and
he
might
if
he
were
not
so
very
well
worthy
of
his
family
name
openly
confess
that
he
was
deceived
when
in
he
as
one
of
the
committee
who
reported
in
favour
of
peel
bill
said
that
the
country
could
pay
the
interest
of
the
debt
in
gold
talk
of
a
of
indeed
what
is
to
be
by
putting
this
man
in
the
place
of
any
of
those
who
are
in
power
now
to
come
back
now
to
lyndhurst
we
had
to
go
about
three
miles
to
new
park
which
is
a
in
the
new
forest
and
nearly
in
the
centre
of
it
we
got
to
this
place
about
nine
there
is
a
good
and
large
here
in
which
the
commissioners
of
woods
and
forests
reside
when
they
come
into
the
forest
there
is
a
garden
a
a
farm
and
a
nursery
the
place
looks
like
a
considerable
seat
the
house
stands
in
a
sort
of
and
you
can
see
that
a
great
deal
of
expense
has
been
incurred
in
levelling
the
ground
and
making
it
pleasing
to
the
eye
of
my
lords
the
commissioners
my
business
here
was
to
see
whether
anything
had
been
done
towards
the
making
of
i
went
first
to
lyndhurst
to
make
inquiries
but
i
was
there
told
that
new
park
was
the
place
and
the
only
place
at
which
to
get
information
on
the
subject
and
i
was
told
further
that
the
commissioners
were
now
at
new
park
that
is
to
say
those
experienced
tree
planters
arbuthnot
dawkins
and
company
gad
thought
i
i
am
here
coming
in
close
contact
with
a
branch
or
at
least
a
twig
of
the
great
thing
itself
when
i
heard
this
i
was
at
breakfast
and
of
course
dressed
for
the
day
i
could
not
out
of
my
extremely
limited
wardrobe
afford
a
clean
shirt
for
the
occasion
and
so
off
we
set
just
as
we
were
hoping
that
their
worships
the
nation
tree
planters
would
if
they
met
with
us
excuse
our
dress
when
they
considered
the
nature
of
our
circumstances
when
we
came
to
the
house
we
were
stopped
by
a
little
fence
and
fastened
gate
i
got
off
my
horse
gave
him
to
george
to
hold
went
up
to
the
door
and
rang
the
bell
having
told
my
business
to
a
person
who
appeared
to
be
a
foreman
or
bailiff
he
with
great
civility
took
me
into
a
nursery
which
is
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
i
soon
drew
from
him
the
disappointing
fact
that
my
lords
the
had
departed
the
day
before
i
found
as
to
that
a
patch
were
sowed
last
spring
which
i
saw
which
are
from
one
foot
to
four
feet
high
and
very
fine
and
strong
and
are
in
number
about
enough
to
plant
two
acres
of
ground
the
plants
at
four
feet
apart
each
way
i
found
that
last
fall
some
few
locusts
had
been
put
out
into
plantations
of
other
trees
already
made
but
that
they
had
and
had
been
by
the
hares
but
a
little
bunch
of
these
trees
same
age
which
were
planted
in
the
nursery
ought
to
convince
my
lords
the
that
if
they
were
to
do
what
they
ought
to
do
the
public
would
very
soon
be
owners
of
fine
plantations
of
locusts
for
the
use
of
the
navy
and
what
are
the
kept
here
eats
them
what
have
these
commissioners
to
keep
hares
here
to
eat
up
the
trees
lord
folkestone
killed
his
hares
before
he
made
his
plantation
of
locusts
and
why
not
kill
the
hares
in
the
forest
for
the
it
is
and
that
these
commissioners
ought
always
to
remember
and
then
again
why
this
farm
what
is
it
why
the
pretence
for
it
is
this
that
it
is
necessary
to
give
the
deer
in
winter
because
the
lopping
down
of
limbs
of
trees
for
them
to
as
used
to
be
the
practice
is
injurious
to
the
growth
of
timber
that
will
be
a
very
good
reason
for
having
a
when
my
lords
shall
have
proved
two
things
first
that
hay
in
quantity
equal
to
what
is
raised
here
could
not
be
bought
for
a
twentieth
part
of
the
money
that
this
farm
and
all
its
trappings
cost
and
second
that
there
ought
to
be
any
deer
kept
what
are
these
deer
who
are
to
them
are
they
for
the
royal
family
why
there
are
more
deer
bred
in
richmond
park
alone
to
say
nothing
of
bushy
park
hyde
park
and
windsor
park
there
are
more
deer
bred
in
richmond
park
alone
than
would
feed
all
the
branches
of
the
royal
family
and
all
their
households
all
the
year
round
if
every
soul
of
them
ate
as
hearty
as
ploughmen
and
if
they
never
touched
a
morsel
of
any
kind
of
meat
but
venison
for
what
and
then
are
deer
kept
in
the
new
forest
and
why
an
expense
of
of
sheds
of
racks
of
keepers
of
lodges
and
other
things
attending
the
deer
and
the
game
an
expense
amounting
to
more
money
annually
than
would
have
given
relief
to
all
the
starving
manufacturers
in
the
north
and
again
i
say
is
all
this
venison
and
game
there
is
more
game
even
in
kew
gardens
than
the
royal
family
can
want
and
in
short
do
they
ever
taste
or
even
hear
of
any
game
or
any
venison
from
the
new
forest
what
a
pretty
thing
here
is
then
here
is
another
deep
bite
into
us
by
the
long
and
aristocracy
who
so
love
old
sarum
is
there
a
man
who
will
say
that
this
is
right
and
that
the
game
should
be
kept
too
to
eat
up
trees
to
destroy
plantations
to
destroy
what
is
first
paid
for
the
planting
of
and
that
the
public
should
pay
keepers
to
preserve
this
game
and
that
the
should
be
if
they
go
out
by
night
to
catch
the
game
that
they
pay
for
feeding
blessed
state
of
an
aristocracy
it
is
pity
that
it
has
got
a
nasty
ugly
obstinate
debt
to
deal
with
it
might
possibly
go
on
for
ages
deer
and
all
were
it
not
for
this
debt
this
new
forest
is
a
piece
of
property
as
much
belonging
the
as
the
at
london
is
there
is
no
man
however
poor
who
has
not
a
right
in
it
every
man
is
owner
of
a
part
of
the
deer
the
game
and
of
the
money
that
goes
to
the
keepers
and
yet
any
man
may
be
if
he
go
out
by
night
to
catch
any
part
of
this
game
we
are
compelled
to
pay
keepers
for
preserving
game
to
eat
up
the
trees
that
we
are
compelled
to
pay
people
to
plant
still
however
there
is
comfort
we
be
worse
off
for
the
turks
made
the
tartars
pay
a
tax
called
that
is
to
say
they
eat
up
the
victuals
of
the
tartars
and
then
made
them
pay
for
the
of
their
no
man
can
say
that
we
are
come
quite
to
that
yet
and
besides
the
poor
tartars
had
no
debt
no
blessed
debt
to
hold
out
hope
to
them
the
same
person
a
very
civil
and
intelligent
man
that
showed
me
the
nursery
took
me
in
my
way
back
through
some
plantations
of
which
have
been
made
amongst
it
was
indeed
a
plantation
of
scotch
firs
about
twelve
years
old
in
rows
at
six
feet
apart
every
third
row
of
firs
was
left
and
oaks
were
about
six
years
ago
planted
instead
of
the
firs
that
were
grubbed
up
and
the
winter
shelter
that
the
oaks
have
received
from
the
remaining
firs
has
made
them
grow
very
finely
though
the
land
is
poor
other
oaks
planted
in
the
twenty
ago
and
in
land
deemed
better
are
not
nearly
so
good
however
these
oaks
between
the
firs
will
take
fifty
or
sixty
good
years
to
make
them
timber
and
until
they
be
they
are
of
very
little
use
whereas
the
same
ground
planted
with
locusts
and
the
of
my
lords
kept
down
would
at
this
moment
have
been
worth
fifty
pounds
an
acre
what
do
my
lords
care
about
this
for
my
lords
the
new
forest
would
be
no
better
than
it
is
now
no
nor
as
it
is
now
for
there
would
be
no
hares
for
them
from
new
park
i
was
bound
to
beaulieu
abbey
and
i
ought
to
have
gone
in
a
direction
instead
of
going
back
to
lyndhurst
which
lay
in
precisely
the
opposite
direction
my
guide
through
the
plantations
was
not
apprised
of
my
intended
route
and
therefore
did
not
instruct
me
just
before
we
parted
he
asked
me
i
thought
it
lucky
that
he
had
not
asked
it
before
when
we
got
nearly
back
to
lyndhurst
we
found
that
we
had
come
three
miles
out
of
our
way
indeed
it
made
six
miles
altogether
for
we
were
when
we
got
to
lyndhurst
three
miles
further
from
beaulieu
abbey
than
we
were
when
we
were
at
new
park
we
wanted
very
much
to
go
to
the
site
of
this
ancient
and
famous
abbey
of
which
the
people
of
the
new
forest
seemed
to
know
very
little
they
call
the
place
and
even
in
the
maps
it
is
called
in
the
saxon
language
means
or
rather
so
that
they
put
in
place
of
thus
beating
the
normans
out
of
some
part
of
the
name
at
any
rate
i
wished
besides
to
see
a
good
deal
of
this
new
forest
i
had
been
before
from
southampton
to
lyndhurst
from
lyndhurst
to
lymington
from
lymington
to
sway
i
had
now
come
in
on
the
north
of
minstead
from
romsey
so
that
i
had
seen
the
north
of
the
forest
and
all
the
west
side
of
it
down
to
the
sea
i
had
now
been
to
new
park
and
had
got
back
to
lyndhurst
so
that
if
i
rode
across
the
forest
down
to
beaulieu
i
went
right
across
the
middle
of
it
from
to
then
if
i
turned
towards
southampton
and
went
to
dipten
and
on
to
ealing
i
should
see
in
fact
the
whole
of
this
forest
or
nearly
the
whole
of
it
we
therefore
started
or
rather
turned
away
from
lyndhurst
as
soon
as
we
got
back
to
it
and
went
about
six
miles
over
a
heath
even
worse
than
as
barren
as
it
is
possible
for
land
to
be
a
little
before
we
came
to
the
village
of
beaulieu
which
observe
the
people
call
we
went
through
a
wood
chiefly
of
beech
and
that
beech
seemingly
destined
to
grow
food
for
pigs
of
which
we
saw
during
this
day
many
many
thousands
i
should
think
that
we
saw
at
least
a
hundred
hogs
to
one
deer
i
stopped
at
one
time
and
counted
the
hogs
and
pigs
just
round
about
me
and
they
amounted
to
all
within
or
yards
of
my
horse
after
a
very
pleasant
ride
on
land
without
a
stone
in
it
we
came
down
to
the
beaulieu
river
the
highest
branch
of
which
rises
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
about
a
mile
and
a
half
to
the
of
lyndhurst
for
a
great
part
of
the
way
down
to
beaulieu
it
is
a
very
insignificant
stream
at
last
however
augmented
by
springs
from
the
different
it
becomes
a
little
river
and
has
on
the
sides
of
it
lands
which
were
formerly
very
beautiful
meadows
when
it
comes
to
the
village
of
beaulieu
it
forms
a
large
pond
of
a
great
many
acres
and
on
the
east
side
of
this
pond
is
the
spot
where
this
famous
abbey
formerly
stood
and
where
the
external
walls
of
which
or
a
large
part
of
them
are
now
actually
standing
we
went
down
on
the
western
side
of
the
river
the
abbey
stood
and
the
ruins
stand
on
the
eastern
side
happening
to
meet
a
man
before
i
got
into
the
village
i
pointing
with
my
whip
across
towards
the
abbey
said
to
the
man
i
suppose
there
is
a
bridge
down
here
to
get
across
to
the
abbey
that
not
the
abbey
sir
says
he
the
abbey
is
about
four
miles
further
on
i
was
astonished
to
hear
this
but
he
was
very
positive
said
that
some
people
called
it
the
abbey
but
that
the
abbey
was
further
on
and
was
at
a
farm
occupied
by
farmer
john
biel
having
chapter
and
verse
for
it
as
the
saying
is
i
believed
the
man
and
pushed
on
towards
farmer
john
biel
which
i
found
as
he
had
told
me
at
the
end
of
about
four
miles
when
i
got
there
not
having
observe
gone
over
the
water
to
ascertain
that
the
other
was
the
spot
where
the
abbey
stood
i
really
thought
at
first
that
this
must
have
been
the
site
of
the
abbey
of
beaulieu
because
the
name
meaning
this
was
a
thousand
times
finer
place
than
that
where
the
abbey
as
i
afterwards
found
really
stood
after
looking
about
it
for
some
time
i
was
satisfied
that
it
had
not
been
an
abbey
but
the
place
is
one
of
the
finest
that
ever
was
seen
in
this
world
it
stands
at
about
half
a
mile
distance
from
the
water
edge
at
mark
and
at
about
the
middle
of
the
space
along
the
coast
from
calshot
castle
to
lymington
haven
it
stands
of
course
upon
a
rising
ground
it
has
a
gentle
slope
down
to
the
water
to
the
right
you
see
hurst
castle
and
that
narrow
passage
called
the
needles
i
believe
and
to
the
left
you
see
spithead
and
all
the
ships
that
are
sailing
or
lie
anywhere
opposite
portsmouth
the
isle
of
wight
is
right
before
you
and
you
have
in
view
at
one
and
the
same
time
the
towns
of
yarmouth
newton
cowes
and
newport
with
all
the
beautiful
fields
of
the
island
lying
upon
the
side
of
a
great
bank
before
and
going
up
the
ridge
of
hills
in
the
middle
of
the
island
here
are
two
little
streams
nearly
close
to
the
ruin
which
filled
ponds
for
fish
while
there
was
the
beaulieu
river
at
about
half
a
mile
or
three
quarters
of
a
mile
to
the
left
to
bring
up
the
fish
the
ruins
consist
of
part
of
the
walls
of
a
building
about
feet
long
and
about
feet
wide
it
has
been
turned
into
a
barn
in
part
and
the
rest
into
and
inclosures
and
walls
to
inclose
a
small
yard
but
there
is
another
ruin
which
was
a
church
or
chapel
and
which
stands
now
very
near
to
the
of
john
biel
who
rents
the
farm
of
the
duchess
of
buccleugh
who
is
now
the
owner
of
the
and
of
the
lands
belonging
to
this
place
the
little
church
or
chapel
of
which
i
have
just
been
speaking
appears
to
have
been
a
very
beautiful
building
a
part
only
of
its
walls
is
standing
but
you
see
by
what
remains
of
the
arches
that
it
was
finished
in
a
manner
the
most
elegant
and
expensive
of
the
day
in
which
it
was
built
part
of
the
outside
of
the
building
is
now
surrounded
by
the
farmer
garden
the
interior
is
partly
a
and
partly
a
under
that
arch
which
had
once
seen
so
many
rich
men
bow
their
heads
we
entered
into
the
which
is
by
no
means
one
of
the
concerns
in
the
world
beyond
the
was
the
and
in
it
a
hog
which
when
fat
will
weigh
about
score
actually
rubbing
his
shoulders
against
a
little
sort
of
column
which
had
supported
the
font
and
its
holy
water
the
farmer
told
us
that
there
was
a
hole
which
indeed
we
saw
going
down
into
the
wall
or
rather
into
the
column
where
the
font
had
stood
and
he
told
us
that
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
bring
water
to
fill
that
hole
but
that
it
never
had
been
done
biel
was
very
civil
to
us
as
far
as
related
to
us
he
performed
the
office
of
hospitality
which
was
the
main
business
of
those
who
formerly
inhabited
the
spot
he
asked
us
to
dine
with
him
which
we
declined
for
want
of
time
but
being
exceedingly
hungry
we
had
some
bread
and
cheese
and
some
very
good
beer
the
farmer
told
me
that
a
great
number
of
gentlemen
had
come
there
to
look
at
that
place
but
that
he
never
could
find
out
what
the
place
had
been
or
what
the
place
at
beuley
had
been
i
told
him
that
i
would
when
i
got
to
london
give
him
an
account
of
it
that
i
would
write
the
account
down
and
send
it
down
to
him
he
seemed
surprised
that
i
should
make
such
a
promise
and
expressed
his
wish
not
to
give
me
so
much
trouble
i
told
him
not
to
say
a
word
about
the
matter
for
that
his
bread
and
cheese
and
beer
were
so
good
that
they
deserved
a
full
history
to
be
written
of
the
place
where
they
had
been
eaten
and
drunk
god
bless
me
sir
no
no
i
said
i
will
upon
my
soul
farmer
i
now
left
him
very
grateful
on
our
part
for
his
hospitable
reception
and
he
i
dare
say
hardly
being
able
to
believe
his
own
ears
at
the
generous
promise
that
i
had
made
him
which
promise
however
i
am
now
about
to
fulfil
i
told
the
farmer
a
little
upon
the
spot
to
begin
with
i
told
him
that
the
name
was
all
wrong
that
it
was
no
but
and
that
beaulieu
meant
and
i
proved
this
to
him
in
this
manner
you
know
said
i
farmer
that
when
a
girl
has
a
people
call
him
her
yes
said
he
so
they
do
very
well
you
know
also
that
we
say
sometimes
you
shall
have
this
in
of
that
and
that
when
we
say
we
mean
in
of
that
now
the
means
as
applied
to
the
young
man
and
the
means
and
thus
it
is
that
the
name
of
this
place
is
as
it
is
so
fine
as
you
see
it
is
he
seemed
to
be
wonderfully
pleased
with
the
discovery
and
we
parted
i
believe
with
hearty
good
wishes
on
his
part
and
i
am
sure
with
very
sincere
thanks
on
my
part
the
abbey
of
beaulieu
was
founded
in
the
year
by
king
john
for
thirty
monks
of
the
reformed
benedictine
order
it
was
dedicated
to
the
blessed
virgin
mary
it
flourished
until
the
year
when
it
was
suppressed
and
the
lands
confiscated
in
the
reign
of
henry
viii
its
revenues
were
at
that
time
hundred
and
pounds
six
shillings
and
eight
pence
a
making
in
money
of
the
present
day
upwards
of
thousand
five
hundred
a
year
the
lands
and
the
abbey
and
all
belonging
to
it
were
granted
by
the
king
to
one
thomas
wriothesley
who
was
a
of
that
day
from
him
it
passed
by
sale
by
will
by
marriage
or
by
something
or
another
till
at
last
it
has
got
after
passing
through
various
hands
into
the
hands
of
the
duchess
of
buccleugh
so
much
for
the
abbey
and
now
as
for
the
ruins
on
the
farm
of
john
biel
they
were
the
of
knights
templars
or
knights
of
john
of
jerusalem
the
building
they
inhabited
was
called
an
hospital
and
their
business
was
to
relieve
travellers
strangers
and
persons
in
distress
and
if
called
upon
to
accompany
the
king
in
his
wars
to
uphold
christianity
their
estate
was
also
confiscated
by
henry
viii
it
was
worth
at
the
time
of
being
confiscated
upwards
of
thousand
pounds
a
money
of
the
present
day
this
establishment
was
founded
a
little
before
the
abbey
of
beaulieu
was
founded
and
it
was
this
foundation
and
not
the
other
that
gave
the
name
of
beaulieu
to
both
establishments
the
abbey
is
not
situated
in
a
very
fine
place
the
situation
is
low
the
lands
above
it
rather
a
swamp
than
otherwise
pretty
enough
altogether
but
by
no
means
a
fine
place
the
templars
had
all
the
reason
in
the
world
to
give
the
name
of
beaulieu
to
their
place
and
it
is
by
no
means
surprising
that
the
monks
were
willing
to
apply
it
to
their
abbey
now
farmer
john
biel
i
dare
say
that
you
are
a
very
good
protestant
and
i
am
a
monstrous
good
protestant
too
we
can
not
bear
the
pope
nor
they
there
priests
that
makes
men
confess
their
sins
and
go
down
upon
their
before
them
but
master
biel
let
us
give
the
devil
his
due
and
let
us
not
act
worse
by
those
roman
catholics
who
were
our
forefathers
than
we
are
willing
to
act
by
the
devil
himself
now
then
here
were
a
set
of
monks
and
also
a
set
of
templars
neither
of
them
could
marry
of
course
neither
of
them
could
have
wives
and
families
they
could
possess
no
private
property
they
could
bequeath
nothing
they
could
own
nothing
but
that
which
they
owned
in
common
with
the
rest
of
their
body
they
could
hoard
no
money
they
could
save
nothing
whatever
they
received
as
rent
for
their
lands
they
must
necessarily
spend
upon
the
spot
for
they
never
could
quit
that
spot
they
did
spend
it
all
upon
the
spot
they
kept
all
the
poor
beuley
and
all
round
about
beuley
saw
no
misery
and
had
never
heard
the
damned
name
of
pauper
pronounced
as
long
as
those
monks
and
templars
continued
you
and
i
are
excellent
protestants
farmer
john
biel
you
and
i
have
often
assisted
on
the
of
november
to
burn
guy
fawkes
the
pope
and
the
devil
but
you
and
i
farmer
john
biel
would
much
rather
be
life
holders
under
monks
and
templars
than
under
duchesses
the
monks
and
the
knights
were
the
of
their
manors
but
the
farmers
under
them
were
not
the
farmers
under
them
held
by
lease
of
lives
continued
in
the
same
farms
from
father
to
son
for
hundreds
of
years
they
were
real
yeomen
and
not
miserable
such
as
now
till
the
land
of
this
once
happy
country
and
who
are
little
better
than
the
drivers
of
the
labourers
for
the
profit
of
the
landlords
farmer
john
biel
what
the
duchess
of
buccleugh
does
you
know
and
i
do
not
she
may
for
anything
that
i
know
to
the
contrary
leave
her
farms
on
lease
of
lives
with
rent
so
very
moderate
and
easy
as
for
the
farm
to
be
half
as
good
as
the
farmer
own
at
any
rate
the
duchess
may
for
anything
that
i
know
to
the
contrary
feed
all
the
hungry
clothe
all
the
naked
comfort
all
the
sick
and
prevent
the
hated
name
of
from
being
pronounced
in
the
district
of
beuley
her
grace
may
for
anything
that
i
know
to
the
contrary
make
to
be
wholly
unnecessary
and
unknown
in
your
country
she
may
receive
lodge
and
feed
the
stranger
she
may
in
short
employ
the
rents
of
this
fine
estate
of
beuley
to
make
the
whole
district
happy
she
may
not
carry
a
farthing
of
the
rents
away
from
the
spot
and
she
may
consume
by
herself
and
her
own
family
and
servants
only
just
as
much
as
is
necessary
to
the
preservation
of
their
life
and
health
her
grace
may
do
all
this
i
do
not
say
or
insinuate
that
she
does
not
do
it
all
but
protestant
here
or
protestant
there
farmer
john
biel
this
i
do
say
that
unless
her
grace
do
all
this
the
monks
and
the
templars
were
better
for
beuley
than
her
grace
from
the
former
station
of
the
templars
from
real
beaulieu
of
the
new
forest
we
came
back
to
the
village
of
beaulieu
and
there
crossed
the
water
to
come
on
towards
southampton
here
we
passed
close
along
under
the
old
abbey
walls
a
great
part
of
which
are
still
standing
there
is
a
mill
here
which
appears
to
be
turned
by
the
fresh
water
but
the
fresh
water
falls
here
into
the
salt
water
as
at
the
village
of
botley
we
did
not
stop
to
go
about
the
ruins
of
the
abbey
for
you
seldom
make
much
out
by
minute
inquiry
it
is
the
political
history
of
these
places
or
at
least
their
connexion
with
political
events
that
is
interesting
just
about
the
banks
of
this
little
river
there
are
some
woods
and
coppices
and
some
but
at
the
distance
of
half
a
mile
from
the
we
came
out
again
upon
the
intolerable
heath
and
went
on
for
seven
or
eight
miles
over
that
heath
from
the
village
of
beaulieu
to
that
of
marchwood
having
a
list
of
trees
and
enclosed
lands
away
to
our
right
all
the
way
along
which
list
of
trees
from
the
side
of
that
arm
of
the
sea
which
goes
from
chalshot
castle
to
redbridge
passing
by
southampton
which
lies
on
the
side
never
was
a
more
barren
tract
of
land
than
these
seven
or
eight
miles
we
had
come
seven
miles
across
the
forest
in
another
direction
in
the
morning
so
that
a
poorer
spot
than
this
new
forest
there
is
not
in
all
england
nor
i
believe
in
the
whole
world
it
is
more
barren
and
miserable
than
bagshot
heath
there
are
less
fertile
spots
in
it
in
proportion
to
the
extent
of
each
still
it
is
so
large
it
is
of
such
great
extent
being
if
moulded
into
a
circle
not
so
little
i
believe
as
or
miles
in
circumference
that
it
must
contain
some
good
spots
of
land
and
if
properly
and
honestly
managed
those
spots
must
produce
a
prodigious
quantity
of
timber
it
is
a
pretty
curious
thing
that
while
the
admirers
of
the
are
boasting
of
our
improvements
there
should
have
been
such
a
visible
and
such
an
enormous
dilapidation
in
all
the
solid
things
of
the
country
i
have
in
former
parts
of
this
ride
stated
that
in
some
counties
while
the
parsons
have
been
pocketing
the
amount
of
the
tithes
and
of
the
glebe
they
have
suffered
the
either
to
fall
down
and
to
be
lost
brick
by
brick
and
stone
by
stone
or
to
become
such
miserable
places
as
to
be
unfit
for
anything
bearing
the
name
of
a
gentleman
to
live
in
i
have
stated
and
i
am
at
any
time
ready
to
prove
that
in
some
counties
this
is
the
case
in
more
than
one
half
of
the
parishes
and
now
amidst
all
these
waust
improvements
let
us
see
how
the
account
of
timber
stands
in
the
new
forest
in
the
year
a
survey
of
the
timber
in
the
new
forest
was
made
when
there
were
loads
of
oak
timber
fit
for
the
navy
mark
that
reader
another
survey
was
taken
in
the
year
that
is
to
say
in
the
glorious
jubilee
reign
and
when
there
were
in
this
same
new
forest
loads
of
oak
timber
fit
for
the
navy
waust
improvements
under
the
pilot
that
weathered
the
storm
and
in
the
reign
of
jubilee
what
the
devil
some
one
would
say
could
have
become
of
all
this
timber
does
the
reader
observe
that
there
were
three
hundred
and
fifteen
thousand
four
hundred
and
and
does
he
observe
that
a
load
is
cubic
does
the
reader
know
what
is
the
price
of
this
load
of
timber
i
suppose
it
is
now
taking
in
lop
top
and
bark
and
bought
upon
the
spot
timber
fit
for
the
navy
mind
ten
pounds
a
load
at
the
least
but
let
us
suppose
that
it
has
been
upon
an
average
since
the
year
just
the
time
that
the
stuarts
were
mounting
the
throne
let
us
suppose
that
it
has
been
on
an
average
four
pounds
a
load
here
is
a
pretty
tough
sum
of
money
this
must
have
gone
into
the
pockets
of
somebody
at
any
rate
if
we
had
the
same
quantity
of
timber
now
that
we
had
when
the
protestant
reformation
took
place
or
even
when
old
betsy
turned
up
her
toes
we
should
be
now
three
millions
of
money
richer
than
we
are
not
in
not
in
notes
payable
to
bearer
on
demand
not
in
scotch
cash
credits
not
in
short
in
lies
falseness
impudence
downright
blackguard
cheatery
and
mining
shares
and
greek
cause
and
the
devil
knows
what
i
shall
have
occasion
to
return
to
this
new
forest
which
is
in
reality
though
in
general
a
very
barren
district
a
much
more
interesting
object
to
englishmen
than
are
the
services
of
my
lord
palmerston
and
the
warlike
undertakings
of
burdett
galloway
and
company
but
i
can
not
quit
this
spot
even
for
the
present
without
asking
the
scotch
and
malthus
and
his
crew
and
especially
george
chalmers
if
he
should
yet
be
creeping
about
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
what
becomes
of
all
their
notions
of
the
scantiness
of
the
ancient
population
of
england
what
becomes
of
all
these
notions
of
all
their
bundles
of
ridiculous
lies
about
the
fewness
of
the
people
in
former
times
what
becomes
of
them
all
if
historians
have
told
us
one
word
of
truth
with
regard
to
the
formation
of
the
new
forest
by
william
the
conqueror
all
the
historians
say
every
one
of
them
says
that
this
king
destroyed
several
populous
towns
and
villages
in
order
to
make
this
new
forest
ride
from
weston
near
southampton
to
kensington
grove
i
broke
off
abruptly
under
this
same
date
in
my
last
register
when
speaking
of
william
the
conqueror
demolishing
of
towns
and
villages
to
make
the
new
forest
and
i
was
about
to
show
that
all
the
historians
have
told
us
lies
the
most
abominable
about
this
affair
of
the
new
forest
or
that
the
scotch
writers
on
population
and
particularly
chalmers
have
been
the
greatest
of
fools
or
the
most
impudent
of
impostors
i
therefore
now
resume
this
matter
it
being
in
my
opinion
a
matter
of
great
interest
at
a
time
when
in
order
to
account
for
the
present
notoriously
of
the
people
of
england
it
is
asserted
that
they
are
become
greatly
more
numerous
than
they
formerly
were
this
would
be
no
defence
of
the
government
even
if
the
fact
were
so
but
as
i
have
over
and
over
again
proved
the
fact
is
false
and
to
this
i
challenge
denial
that
either
churches
and
great
mansions
and
castles
were
formerly
made
without
hands
or
england
was
seven
hundred
years
ago
much
more
populous
than
it
is
now
but
what
has
the
formation
of
the
new
forest
to
do
with
this
a
great
deal
for
the
historians
tell
us
that
in
order
to
make
this
forest
william
the
conqueror
destroyed
many
populous
towns
and
villages
and
parish
churches
the
devil
he
did
how
then
good
god
must
england
have
been
at
that
time
which
was
about
the
year
that
is
to
say
years
ago
for
the
scotch
will
hardly
contend
that
the
of
the
has
been
changed
for
the
worse
since
that
time
especially
as
it
has
not
been
cultivated
no
no
as
they
are
they
will
not
do
that
come
then
let
us
see
how
this
matter
stands
this
forest
has
been
crawled
upon
by
favourites
and
is
now
much
smaller
than
it
used
to
be
a
time
may
and
come
for
inquiring
how
george
rose
and
others
became
of
some
of
the
very
best
parts
of
this
property
a
time
for
such
inquiry
come
before
the
people
of
england
will
ever
give
their
consent
to
reduction
of
the
interest
of
the
but
this
we
know
that
the
new
forest
formerly
extended
westward
from
the
southampton
water
and
the
river
oux
to
the
river
avon
and
northward
from
lymington
haven
to
the
borders
of
wiltshire
we
know
that
this
was
its
utmost
extent
and
we
know
also
that
the
towns
of
christchurch
lymington
ringwood
and
fordingbridge
and
the
villages
of
bolder
fawley
lyndhurst
dipden
eling
minsted
and
all
the
other
villages
that
now
have
churches
we
know
i
say
and
pray
mark
it
that
all
these
towns
and
villages
existed
before
the
norman
conquest
because
the
of
several
of
them
all
the
towns
are
in
print
and
because
an
account
of
them
all
is
to
be
found
in
which
was
made
by
this
very
william
the
conqueror
well
then
now
scotch
and
you
malthusian
blasphemers
who
contend
that
god
has
implanted
in
man
a
that
him
to
come
now
and
face
this
history
of
the
new
forest
cooke
in
his
geography
of
hampshire
says
that
the
conqueror
destroyed
here
many
populous
towns
and
villages
and
parish
churches
the
same
writer
says
that
in
the
time
of
edward
the
confessor
before
the
conqueror
came
of
the
forest
was
inhabited
and
cultivated
guthrie
says
nearly
the
same
thing
but
let
us
hear
the
two
historians
who
are
now
pitted
against
each
other
hume
and
lingard
the
former
vol
ii
says
there
was
one
pleasure
to
which
william
as
well
as
all
the
normans
and
ancient
saxons
was
extremely
addicted
and
that
was
hunting
but
this
pleasure
he
indulged
more
at
the
expense
of
his
unhappy
subjects
whose
interests
he
always
disregarded
than
to
the
loss
or
diminution
of
his
own
revenue
not
content
with
those
large
forests
which
former
kings
possessed
in
all
parts
of
england
he
resolved
to
make
a
new
forest
near
winchester
the
usual
place
of
his
residence
and
for
that
purpose
he
the
county
of
hampshire
an
extent
of
thirty
miles
expelled
the
from
their
houses
seized
their
property
even
churches
and
and
made
the
sufferers
no
compensation
for
the
injury
pretty
well
for
a
pensioned
scotchman
and
now
let
us
hear
lingard
to
prevent
his
society
from
whose
work
to
the
sincere
and
pious
samuel
butler
was
ready
to
go
down
upon
his
let
us
hear
the
good
doctor
upon
this
subject
he
says
vol
pp
and
though
the
king
possessed
forests
besides
parks
and
chases
in
different
parts
of
england
he
was
not
yet
satisfied
but
for
the
occasional
accommodation
of
his
court
afforested
an
tract
of
lying
between
the
city
of
winchester
and
the
sea
coast
the
were
the
cottages
and
the
were
and
more
than
square
of
a
and
district
were
from
and
converted
into
a
to
afford
sufficient
range
for
the
deer
and
ample
space
for
the
royal
diversion
the
memory
of
this
act
of
despotism
has
been
perpetuated
in
the
name
of
the
new
forest
which
it
retains
at
the
present
day
after
the
lapse
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
years
should
be
careful
how
they
make
statements
relative
to
which
are
within
the
scope
of
the
reader
it
is
next
to
impossible
not
to
believe
that
the
doctor
has
in
this
case
a
very
interesting
one
merely
from
hume
hume
says
that
the
king
the
inhabitants
and
lingard
says
the
inhabitants
hume
says
that
the
king
the
churches
and
lingard
says
that
the
churches
were
but
hume
says
churches
and
and
lingard
that
to
be
a
lie
the
doctor
was
too
learned
upon
the
subject
of
to
follow
the
scotchman
here
hume
says
that
the
king
laid
the
country
for
an
of
thirty
the
doctor
says
that
a
district
of
square
was
withdrawn
from
cultivation
and
converted
into
a
now
what
hume
meaned
by
the
loose
phrase
an
of
thirty
i
can
not
say
but
this
i
know
that
thirty
square
miles
is
a
piece
of
ground
only
five
and
a
half
miles
each
way
so
that
the
doctor
has
got
here
a
curious
and
a
not
less
curious
and
what
number
of
could
william
find
to
in
a
space
five
miles
and
a
half
each
way
if
the
doctor
meaned
thirty
instead
of
the
falsehood
is
so
monstrous
as
to
destroy
his
credit
for
ever
for
here
we
have
nine
hundred
square
miles
containing
hundred
and
thousand
acres
of
that
is
to
say
acres
more
than
are
contained
in
the
whole
of
the
county
of
surrey
and
acres
more
than
are
contained
in
the
whole
of
the
county
of
berks
this
is
is
it
and
these
are
the
true
statement
is
this
the
new
forest
according
to
its
ancient
state
was
bounded
thus
by
the
line
going
from
the
river
oux
to
the
river
avon
and
which
line
there
separates
wiltshire
from
hampshire
by
the
river
avon
by
the
sea
from
christchurch
to
calshot
castle
by
the
southampton
water
and
by
the
river
oux
these
are
the
boundaries
and
as
any
one
may
by
scale
and
compass
ascertain
there
are
within
these
boundaries
about
square
miles
containing
acres
of
land
within
these
limits
there
are
now
remaining
eleven
parish
churches
all
of
which
were
in
existence
before
the
time
of
william
the
conqueror
so
that
if
he
destroyed
parish
churches
what
a
populous
country
this
must
have
been
there
must
have
been
parish
churches
so
that
there
was
over
this
whole
district
one
parish
church
to
every
four
and
three
quarters
square
miles
thus
then
the
churches
must
have
stood
on
an
average
at
within
one
mile
and
about
two
hundred
yards
of
each
other
and
observe
the
parishes
could
on
an
average
contain
no
more
each
than
acres
of
land
not
a
very
large
farm
so
that
here
was
a
parish
church
to
every
large
farm
unless
these
historians
are
all
fools
and
liars
i
defy
any
one
to
say
that
i
make
hazardous
assertions
i
have
plainly
described
the
ancient
boundaries
there
are
any
one
can
with
scale
and
compass
measure
the
area
as
well
as
i
can
i
have
taken
the
statements
of
historians
as
they
call
themselves
i
have
shown
that
their
histories
as
they
call
them
are
fabulous
or
and
mind
this
that
england
was
at
one
time
and
that
too
eight
hundred
years
ago
all
measure
more
populous
than
it
is
for
observe
notwithstanding
what
lingard
asserts
notwithstanding
that
he
describes
this
district
as
it
is
the
very
poorest
in
the
whole
kingdom
lingard
was
i
believe
born
and
bred
at
winchester
and
how
then
could
he
be
so
careless
or
indeed
so
regardless
of
truth
and
i
do
not
see
why
i
am
to
mince
the
matter
with
him
as
to
describe
this
as
a
innumerable
persons
have
seen
great
numbers
have
seen
the
barren
heaths
between
london
and
brighton
great
numbers
also
have
seen
that
wide
sweep
of
barrenness
which
exhibits
itself
between
the
golden
farmer
hill
and
of
each
of
these
are
less
barren
than
of
the
land
in
the
new
forest
supposing
it
to
be
credible
that
a
man
so
prudent
and
so
wise
as
william
the
conqueror
supposing
that
such
a
man
should
have
pitched
upon
a
and
district
wherewith
to
make
a
chase
supposing
in
short
these
historians
to
have
spoken
the
truth
and
supposing
this
barren
land
to
have
been
all
inhabited
and
cultivated
and
the
people
so
numerous
and
so
rich
as
to
be
able
to
build
and
endow
a
parish
church
upon
every
four
and
three
quarters
square
miles
upon
this
extensive
district
supposing
them
to
have
been
so
rich
in
the
produce
of
the
soil
as
to
want
a
priest
to
be
stationed
at
every
mile
and
yards
in
order
to
help
them
to
eat
it
supposing
in
a
word
these
historians
not
to
be
the
most
farcical
liars
that
ever
put
pen
upon
paper
this
country
must
at
the
time
of
the
norman
conquest
have
literally
with
people
for
is
the
land
and
all
the
land
too
neither
hume
nor
lingard
can
change
the
nature
of
that
there
it
is
an
acre
of
it
not
having
upon
an
average
so
much
of
productive
capacity
in
it
as
one
single
square
rod
taking
the
average
of
worcestershire
and
if
i
were
to
say
one
single
i
should
be
right
there
is
the
land
and
if
that
land
were
as
these
historians
say
it
was
covered
with
people
and
with
churches
what
the
devil
must
worcestershire
have
been
to
this
then
we
come
at
last
having
made
out
what
i
undertook
to
show
namely
that
the
historians
as
they
call
themselves
are
either
the
greatest
fools
or
the
greatest
liars
that
ever
existed
or
that
england
was
beyond
all
measure
more
populous
eight
hundred
years
ago
than
it
is
now
poor
however
as
this
district
is
and
culled
about
as
it
has
been
for
the
best
spots
of
land
by
those
favourites
who
have
got
grants
of
land
or
leases
or
something
or
other
still
there
are
some
spots
here
and
there
which
would
grow
trees
but
never
will
it
grow
trees
or
anything
else
the
profit
of
this
until
it
become
public
property
must
in
some
cases
be
in
the
hands
of
public
officers
but
this
is
not
an
affair
of
that
nature
this
is
too
loose
a
concern
too
little
controllable
by
superiors
it
is
a
thing
calculated
for
jobbing
above
all
others
calculated
to
promote
the
success
of
favouritism
who
can
imagine
that
the
persons
employed
about
plantations
and
farms
for
the
public
are
employed
because
are
for
the
employment
supposing
the
commissioners
to
hold
in
abhorrence
the
idea
of
paying
for
services
to
themselves
under
the
name
of
paying
for
services
to
the
public
supposing
them
never
to
have
heard
of
such
a
thing
in
their
lives
can
they
imagine
that
nothing
of
this
sort
takes
place
while
they
are
in
london
eleven
months
out
of
twelve
in
the
year
i
never
feel
disposed
to
cast
much
censure
upon
any
of
the
persons
engaged
in
such
concerns
the
temptation
is
too
great
to
be
resisted
the
public
must
pay
for
everything
pois
therefore
no
such
thing
should
be
in
the
hands
of
the
public
or
rather
of
the
government
and
i
hope
to
live
to
see
this
thing
completely
taken
out
of
the
hands
of
this
government
it
was
when
we
arrived
at
eling
that
is
to
say
at
the
head
of
the
southampton
water
our
horses
were
very
hungry
we
stopped
to
bait
them
and
set
off
just
about
dusk
to
come
to
this
place
weston
grove
stopping
at
southampton
on
our
way
and
leaving
a
letter
to
come
to
london
between
southampton
and
this
place
we
cross
a
bridge
over
the
itchen
river
and
coming
up
a
hill
into
a
common
which
is
called
common
we
passed
lying
on
our
right
a
little
park
and
house
occupied
by
the
irish
lord
ashdown
i
think
they
call
him
whose
real
name
is
french
and
whose
family
are
so
very
in
the
most
unfortunate
just
at
the
back
of
his
house
in
another
sort
of
lives
a
man
whose
name
i
forget
who
was
i
believe
a
coachmaker
in
the
east
indies
and
whose
father
or
uncle
kept
a
turnpike
gate
at
chelsea
a
few
years
ago
see
the
effects
of
and
but
even
these
would
be
nothing
were
it
not
for
this
wondrous
system
by
which
money
can
be
snatched
away
from
the
labourer
in
this
very
parish
for
instance
sent
off
to
the
east
indies
there
help
to
make
a
mass
to
put
into
the
hands
of
an
adventurer
and
then
the
mass
may
be
brought
back
in
the
pockets
of
the
adventurer
and
cause
him
to
be
called
a
by
the
labourer
whose
earnings
were
so
snatched
away
wondrous
system
pity
it
can
not
last
for
ever
pity
that
it
has
got
a
debt
of
a
thousand
millions
to
pay
pity
that
it
can
not
turn
paper
into
gold
pity
that
it
will
make
such
fools
of
prosperity
robinson
and
his
colleagues
the
moon
shone
very
bright
by
the
time
that
we
mounted
the
hill
and
now
skirting
the
enclosures
upon
the
edge
of
the
common
we
passed
several
of
those
cottages
which
i
so
well
recollected
and
in
which
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
believe
that
the
inhabitants
were
sitting
comfortably
with
bellies
full
by
a
good
fire
it
was
eight
before
we
arrived
at
chamberlayne
whom
i
had
not
seen
since
i
think
the
year
for
in
the
fall
of
that
year
i
came
to
london
and
i
never
returned
to
botley
which
is
only
about
three
miles
and
a
half
from
weston
to
stay
there
for
any
length
of
time
to
those
who
like
as
of
people
do
it
is
the
prettiest
spot
i
believe
in
all
england
chamberlayne
built
the
house
about
twenty
years
ago
he
has
been
bringing
the
place
to
greater
and
greater
perfection
from
that
time
to
this
all
round
about
the
house
is
in
the
neatest
possible
order
i
should
think
that
altogether
there
can
not
be
so
little
as
acres
of
short
and
when
i
say
those
who
know
anything
about
gardens
will
form
a
pretty
correct
general
notion
as
to
the
on
which
the
thing
is
carried
on
until
of
late
chamberlayne
was
owner
of
only
a
small
part
comparatively
of
the
lands
hereabouts
he
is
now
the
owner
i
believe
of
the
whole
of
the
lands
that
come
down
to
the
water
edge
and
that
lie
between
the
ferry
over
the
itchen
at
southampton
and
the
river
which
goes
out
from
the
southampton
water
at
hamble
and
now
let
me
describe
as
well
as
i
can
what
this
land
and
its
situation
are
the
southampton
water
begins
at
portsmouth
and
goes
up
by
southampton
to
redbridge
being
upon
an
average
about
two
miles
wide
having
on
the
one
side
the
new
forest
and
on
the
other
side
for
a
great
part
of
the
way
this
fine
and
beautiful
estate
of
chamberlayne
both
sides
of
this
water
have
rising
lands
divided
into
hill
and
dale
and
very
beautifully
clothed
with
trees
the
woods
and
lawns
and
fields
being
most
advantageously
intermixed
it
is
very
curious
that
at
the
of
each
of
these
tracts
of
land
there
are
extensive
heaths
on
this
side
as
well
as
on
the
new
forest
side
to
stand
here
and
look
across
the
water
at
the
new
forest
you
would
imagine
that
it
was
really
country
of
for
you
can
see
nothing
of
the
heaths
from
here
those
heaths
over
which
we
rode
and
from
which
we
could
see
a
windmill
down
among
the
trees
which
windmill
is
now
to
be
seen
just
opposite
this
place
so
that
the
views
from
this
place
are
the
most
beautiful
that
can
be
imagined
you
see
up
the
water
and
down
the
water
to
redbridge
one
way
and
out
to
spithead
the
other
way
through
the
trees
to
the
right
you
see
the
spires
of
southampton
and
you
have
only
to
walk
a
mile
over
a
beautiful
lawn
and
through
a
not
less
beautiful
wood
to
find
in
a
little
dell
surrounded
with
lofty
woods
the
venerable
ruins
of
which
make
part
of
estate
the
woods
here
are
chiefly
of
oak
the
ground
consists
of
a
series
of
hill
and
dale
as
you
go
from
one
end
of
the
estate
to
the
other
six
miles
in
down
almost
every
little
valley
that
divides
these
hills
or
hillocks
there
is
more
or
less
of
water
making
the
underwood
in
those
parts
very
thick
and
dark
to
go
through
and
these
form
the
most
delightful
contrast
with
the
fields
and
lawns
there
are
innumerable
vessels
of
various
sizes
continually
upon
the
water
and
to
those
that
delight
in
this
is
certainly
the
very
prettiest
place
that
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
i
had
seen
it
many
years
ago
and
as
i
intended
to
come
here
on
my
way
home
i
told
george
before
we
set
out
that
i
would
show
him
before
we
got
to
london
the
parish
in
which
his
father
house
is
is
also
called
weston
and
a
very
beautiful
spot
it
certainly
is
but
i
told
him
i
questioned
whether
i
could
not
show
him
a
still
prettier
weston
than
that
we
let
him
alone
for
the
first
day
he
sat
in
the
house
and
saw
great
multitudes
of
pheasants
and
partridges
upon
the
lawn
before
the
window
he
went
down
to
the
by
himself
and
put
his
foot
upon
the
ground
to
see
the
tide
rise
he
seemed
very
much
delighted
the
second
morning
at
breakfast
we
put
it
to
him
which
he
would
rather
have
this
weston
or
the
weston
he
had
left
in
herefordshire
but
though
i
introduced
the
question
in
a
way
almost
to
extort
a
decision
in
favour
of
the
hampshire
weston
he
decided
instantly
and
plump
for
the
other
in
a
manner
very
much
to
the
delight
of
chamberlayne
and
his
sister
so
true
it
is
that
when
people
are
uncorrupted
they
always
home
be
it
in
itself
what
it
may
everything
that
nature
can
do
has
been
done
here
and
money
most
judiciously
employed
has
come
to
her
assistance
here
are
a
thousand
things
to
give
pleasure
to
any
rational
mind
but
there
is
one
thing
which
in
my
estimation
surpasses
in
pleasure
to
contemplate
all
the
lawns
and
all
the
groves
and
all
the
gardens
and
all
the
game
and
everything
else
and
that
is
the
real
unaffected
goodness
of
the
owner
of
this
estate
he
is
a
member
for
southampton
he
has
other
fine
estates
he
has
great
talents
he
is
much
admired
by
all
who
know
him
but
he
has
done
more
by
his
justice
by
his
just
way
of
thinking
with
regard
to
the
labouring
people
than
in
all
other
ways
put
together
this
was
nothing
new
to
me
for
i
was
well
informed
of
it
several
years
ago
though
i
had
never
heard
him
speak
of
it
in
my
life
when
he
came
to
this
place
the
common
wages
of
men
were
shillings
a
and
the
wages
of
carpenters
bricklayers
and
other
tradesmen
were
in
proportion
those
wages
he
given
from
that
time
to
without
any
abatement
whatever
with
these
wages
a
man
can
live
having
at
the
same
time
other
advantages
attending
the
working
for
such
a
man
as
chamberlayne
he
has
got
less
money
in
his
bags
than
he
would
have
had
if
he
had
ground
men
down
in
their
wages
but
if
his
sleep
be
not
sounder
than
that
of
the
wretch
that
can
walk
over
grass
and
gravel
kept
in
order
by
a
poor
creature
that
is
if
his
sleep
be
not
sounder
than
the
sleep
of
such
a
wretch
then
all
that
we
have
been
taught
is
false
and
there
is
no
difference
between
the
man
who
feeds
and
the
man
who
starves
the
poor
all
the
scripture
is
a
bundle
of
lies
and
instead
of
being
propagated
it
ought
to
be
flung
into
the
fire
it
is
curious
enough
that
those
who
are
the
least
disposed
to
give
good
wages
to
the
labouring
people
should
be
the
most
disposed
to
discover
for
them
for
saving
their
i
have
lately
seen
i
saw
it
at
uphusband
a
prospectus
or
scheme
for
establishing
what
they
call
a
friendly
this
is
a
scheme
for
getting
from
the
poor
a
part
of
the
wages
that
they
receive
just
as
if
a
poor
fellow
could
anything
out
of
eight
shillings
a
week
if
indeed
the
schemers
were
to
pay
the
labourers
twelve
or
thirteen
shillings
a
week
then
these
might
have
something
to
lay
by
at
some
times
of
the
year
but
then
indeed
there
would
be
and
it
is
to
rid
of
the
that
these
schemers
have
invented
their
society
what
wretched
drivellers
they
must
be
to
think
that
they
should
be
able
to
make
the
pauper
keep
the
pauper
to
think
that
they
shall
be
able
to
make
the
man
that
is
lay
by
part
of
his
loaf
i
know
of
no
county
where
the
poor
are
worse
treated
than
in
many
parts
of
this
county
of
hants
it
is
happy
to
know
of
one
instance
in
which
they
are
well
treated
and
i
deem
it
a
real
honour
to
be
under
the
roof
of
him
who
has
uniformly
set
so
laudable
an
example
in
this
most
important
concern
what
are
all
his
riches
to
me
they
form
no
title
to
my
respect
is
not
for
me
to
set
myself
up
in
judgment
as
to
his
taste
his
learning
his
various
qualities
and
endowments
but
of
these
his
unequivocal
works
i
am
a
competent
judge
i
know
how
much
good
he
must
do
and
there
is
a
great
satisfaction
in
reflecting
on
the
great
happiness
that
he
must
feel
when
in
laying
his
head
upon
his
pillow
of
a
cold
and
dreary
winter
night
he
reflects
that
there
are
scores
aye
scores
upon
scores
of
his
of
his
poor
neighbours
of
those
whom
the
scripture
denominates
his
brethren
who
have
been
enabled
through
him
to
retire
to
a
warm
bed
after
spending
a
cheerful
evening
and
taking
a
full
meal
by
the
side
of
their
own
fire
people
may
talk
what
they
will
about
but
i
can
figure
to
myself
no
happiness
surpassing
that
of
the
man
who
falls
to
sleep
with
reflections
like
these
in
his
mind
now
observe
it
is
a
duty
on
my
part
to
relate
what
i
have
here
related
as
to
the
conduct
of
chamberlayne
not
a
duty
towards
for
i
can
do
him
no
good
by
it
and
i
do
most
sincerely
believe
that
both
he
and
his
equally
benevolent
sister
would
rather
that
their
goodness
remained
unproclaimed
but
it
is
a
duty
towards
my
country
and
particularly
towards
my
readers
here
is
a
striking
and
a
most
valuable
practical
example
here
is
a
whole
neighbourhood
of
labourers
living
as
they
ought
to
live
enjoying
that
happiness
which
is
the
just
reward
of
their
toil
and
shall
i
suppress
facts
so
honourable
to
those
who
are
the
cause
of
this
happiness
facts
so
interesting
in
themselves
and
so
likely
to
be
useful
in
the
way
of
example
shall
i
do
this
aye
and
besides
this
give
a
of
weston
grove
and
this
too
from
the
stupid
and
cowardly
fear
of
being
accused
of
flattering
a
rich
man
netley
abbey
ought
it
seems
to
be
called
letley
abbey
the
latin
name
being
lætus
locus
or
pleasant
place
was
made
up
of
an
abbreviation
of
the
and
of
the
saxon
word
which
meaned
or
of
this
abbey
was
founded
by
henry
iii
in
for
monks
of
the
benedictine
order
and
when
suppressed
by
the
its
revenues
amounted
to
a
year
of
our
present
money
the
possessions
of
these
monks
were
by
the
founder
of
the
church
of
england
given
away
though
they
belonged
to
the
public
to
one
of
his
court
sycophants
sir
william
paulet
a
man
the
most
famous
in
the
whole
world
for
sycophancy
and
for
all
those
qualities
which
usually
distinguish
the
favourites
of
kings
like
the
this
paulet
changed
from
the
popish
to
henry
the
eighth
religion
and
was
a
great
actor
in
punishing
the
papists
when
edward
vi
came
to
the
throne
this
paulet
turned
protestant
and
was
a
great
actor
in
punishing
those
who
adhered
to
henry
viiith
religion
when
queen
mary
came
to
the
throne
this
paulet
turned
back
to
papist
and
was
one
of
the
great
actors
in
sending
protestants
to
be
burnt
in
smithfield
when
old
bess
came
to
the
throne
this
paulet
turned
back
to
protestant
again
and
was
until
the
day
of
his
death
one
of
the
great
actors
in
persecuting
in
fining
in
mulcting
and
in
putting
to
death
those
who
still
had
the
virtue
and
the
courage
to
adhere
to
the
religion
in
which
they
and
he
had
been
born
and
bred
the
of
this
family
got
at
last
to
be
earl
of
wiltshire
marquis
of
winchester
and
duke
of
bolton
this
last
title
is
now
or
rather
it
is
changed
to
that
of
lord
bolton
which
is
now
borne
by
a
man
of
the
name
of
orde
who
is
the
son
of
a
man
of
that
name
who
died
some
years
ago
and
who
married
a
daughter
i
think
it
was
of
the
last
duke
of
bolton
pretty
curious
and
not
a
little
interesting
to
look
back
at
the
of
this
dukedom
of
bolton
and
then
to
look
at
the
person
now
bearing
the
title
of
and
then
to
go
to
abbotston
near
winchester
and
survey
the
ruins
of
the
proud
palace
once
inhabited
by
the
duke
of
bolton
which
ruins
and
the
estate
on
which
they
stand
are
now
the
property
of
the
alexander
baring
curious
turn
of
things
henry
the
and
his
confiscating
successors
the
estates
of
netley
and
of
many
other
monasteries
to
the
head
of
these
paulets
to
maintain
these
and
other
similar
grants
a
thing
called
a
reformation
was
made
to
maintain
the
reformation
a
glorious
revolution
was
made
to
maintain
the
glorious
revolution
a
was
made
to
maintain
the
debt
a
large
part
of
the
rents
must
go
to
the
or
and
thus
at
last
the
barings
only
in
this
one
neighbourhood
have
become
the
successors
of
the
wriothesleys
the
paulets
and
the
russells
who
throughout
all
the
reigns
of
confiscation
were
constantly
the
when
a
distribution
of
good
things
was
taking
place
curious
enough
all
this
but
the
thing
will
not
the
think
that
they
shall
outwit
the
old
and
so
they
might
and
the
people
too
and
the
devil
himself
but
they
can
not
those
events
have
a
thorough
and
of
this
fact
the
gentlemen
may
be
assured
can
it
be
i
put
the
question
to
can
it
be
i
leave
reason
and
justice
out
of
the
inquiry
can
it
be
that
if
i
see
dressed
in
good
clothes
and
with
a
full
purse
a
man
who
was
notoriously
penniless
yesterday
can
it
be
law
that
i
being
a
justice
of
the
peace
have
a
right
to
demand
of
that
man
he
came
by
his
clothes
and
his
and
can
it
be
that
i
seeing
with
an
estate
a
man
who
was
notoriously
not
worth
a
crown
piece
a
few
years
ago
and
who
is
notoriously
related
to
nothing
more
than
one
degree
above
beggary
can
it
be
that
i
a
magistrate
seeing
this
have
not
a
right
to
demand
of
this
man
how
he
came
by
his
estate
no
matter
however
for
if
both
these
be
law
now
they
will
not
i
trust
be
law
in
a
few
years
from
this
time
chamberlayne
has
caused
the
ancient
at
netley
abbey
to
be
reclaimed
as
they
call
it
what
a
loss
what
a
national
loss
there
has
been
in
this
way
and
in
the
article
of
water
fowl
i
am
quite
satisfied
that
in
these
two
articles
and
in
that
of
the
nation
has
lost
has
had
annihilated
within
the
last
years
food
sufficient
for
two
days
in
the
week
on
an
average
taking
the
year
throughout
these
are
things
too
which
cost
so
little
labour
you
can
see
the
marks
of
old
in
thousands
and
thousands
of
places
i
have
noticed
i
dare
say
five
hundred
since
i
left
home
a
trifling
expense
would
in
most
cases
restore
them
but
all
is
looked
for
at
shops
all
is
to
be
had
by
trafficking
scarcely
any
one
thinks
of
providing
for
his
own
wants
out
of
his
own
land
and
other
his
own
domestic
means
to
buy
the
thing
is
the
taste
of
the
day
thousands
who
are
housekeepers
buy
their
dinners
ready
cooked
nothing
is
so
common
as
to
rent
breasts
for
children
to
suck
a
man
actually
advertised
in
the
london
papers
about
two
month
ago
to
supply
childless
husbands
with
heirs
in
this
case
the
articles
were
of
course
to
be
for
to
make
them
to
order
would
be
the
devil
of
a
business
though
in
desperate
cases
even
this
is
i
believe
sometimes
resorted
to
sunday
we
left
weston
grove
on
friday
morning
and
came
across
to
botley
where
we
remained
during
the
rest
of
the
day
and
until
after
breakfast
yesterday
i
had
not
seen
the
botley
parson
for
several
years
and
i
wished
to
have
a
look
at
him
now
but
could
not
get
a
sight
of
him
though
we
rode
close
before
his
house
at
much
about
his
breakfast
time
and
though
we
gave
him
the
strongest
of
invitation
that
could
be
expressed
by
hallooing
and
by
cracking
of
whips
the
fox
was
too
cunning
for
us
and
do
all
we
could
we
could
not
provoke
him
to
put
even
his
nose
out
of
kennel
from
james
warner
at
botley
we
went
to
hallett
at
allington
and
had
the
very
great
pleasure
of
seeing
him
in
excellent
health
we
intended
to
go
back
to
botley
and
then
to
go
to
titchfield
and
in
our
way
to
this
place
over
portsdown
hill
whence
i
intended
to
show
george
the
harbour
and
the
fleet
and
of
still
more
importance
the
spot
on
which
we
signed
the
hampshire
petition
in
that
petition
which
foretold
that
which
the
norfolk
petition
confirmed
that
petition
which
will
be
finally
acted
upon
or
that
petition
was
the
very
thing
that
i
wrote
at
i
came
to
london
in
november
the
bill
was
passed
in
february
just
before
it
was
passed
the
meeting
took
place
on
portsdown
hill
and
i
in
my
way
to
the
hill
from
london
stopped
at
botley
and
wrote
the
petition
we
had
one
meeting
afterwards
at
winchester
when
i
heard
parsons
swear
like
troopers
and
saw
one
of
them
hawk
up
his
spittle
and
spit
it
into
lord
cochrane
poll
ah
my
bucks
we
have
you
you
are
got
nearly
to
the
end
of
your
tether
and
what
is
more
know
pay
off
the
debt
parsons
it
is
useless
to
swear
and
spit
and
to
present
addresses
applauding
bills
unless
you
can
pay
off
the
debt
pay
off
the
debt
parsons
they
say
you
can
the
devil
lay
devil
then
or
confess
that
he
is
too
many
for
you
aye
and
for
sturges
bourne
or
bourne
sturges
i
forget
which
at
your
backs
from
arlington
we
fearing
that
it
would
rain
before
we
could
get
round
by
titchfield
came
across
the
country
over
waltham
chase
and
soberton
down
the
chase
was
very
green
and
fine
but
the
down
was
the
very
greenest
thing
that
i
have
seen
in
the
whole
country
it
is
not
a
large
down
perhaps
not
more
than
five
or
six
hundred
acres
but
the
land
is
good
the
chalk
is
at
a
foot
from
the
surface
or
more
the
mould
is
a
hazel
mould
and
when
i
was
upon
the
opposite
hill
i
could
though
i
knew
the
spot
very
well
hardly
believe
that
it
was
a
down
the
green
was
darker
than
that
of
any
pasture
or
even
any
sainfoin
or
clover
that
i
had
seen
throughout
the
whole
of
my
ride
and
i
should
suppose
that
there
could
not
have
been
many
less
than
a
thousand
sheep
in
the
three
flocks
that
were
feeding
upon
the
down
when
i
came
across
it
i
do
not
speak
with
anything
like
positiveness
as
to
the
measurement
of
this
down
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
exceeds
six
hundred
and
fifty
acres
they
must
have
had
more
rain
in
this
part
of
the
country
than
in
most
other
parts
of
it
indeed
no
part
of
hampshire
seems
to
have
suffered
very
much
from
the
drought
i
found
the
turnips
pretty
good
of
both
sorts
all
the
way
from
andover
to
rumsey
through
the
new
forest
you
may
as
well
expect
to
find
loaves
of
bread
growing
in
fields
as
turnips
where
there
are
any
fields
for
them
to
grow
in
from
redbridge
to
weston
we
had
not
light
enough
to
see
much
about
us
but
when
we
came
down
to
botley
we
there
found
the
turnips
as
good
as
i
had
ever
seen
them
in
my
life
as
far
i
could
judge
from
the
time
i
had
to
look
at
them
warner
has
as
fine
turnip
fields
as
i
ever
saw
him
have
swedish
turnips
and
white
also
and
pretty
nearly
the
same
may
be
said
of
the
whole
of
that
neighbourhood
for
many
miles
round
after
quitting
soberton
down
we
came
up
a
hill
leading
to
hambledon
and
turned
off
to
our
left
to
bring
us
down
to
goldsmith
at
west
end
where
we
now
are
at
about
a
mile
from
the
village
of
hambledon
a
village
it
is
but
it
was
formerly
a
considerable
and
it
had
three
fairs
in
the
year
there
is
now
not
even
the
name
of
market
left
i
believe
and
the
fairs
amount
to
little
more
than
a
couple
or
three
with
dolls
and
whistles
for
children
if
you
go
through
the
place
you
see
that
it
has
been
a
considerable
town
the
church
tells
the
same
story
it
is
now
a
rubbishy
place
it
is
partaking
in
the
fate
of
all
those
places
which
were
formerly
a
sort
of
rendezvous
for
persons
who
had
things
to
buy
and
things
to
sell
have
devoured
and
villages
and
have
devoured
and
and
this
too
to
the
infinite
injury
of
the
most
numerous
classes
of
the
people
merely
as
is
injurious
to
any
community
what
are
the
shop
and
the
for
to
receive
and
distribute
the
produce
of
the
land
there
are
other
articles
certainly
but
the
main
part
is
the
produce
of
the
land
the
shop
must
be
paid
for
the
must
be
kept
and
the
one
must
be
paid
for
and
the
other
must
be
kept
by
the
consumer
of
the
produce
or
perhaps
partly
by
the
consumer
and
partly
by
the
producer
when
fairs
were
very
frequent
shops
were
not
needed
a
manufacturer
of
shoes
of
stockings
of
hats
of
almost
any
thing
that
man
wants
could
manufacture
at
home
in
an
obscure
hamlet
with
cheap
good
air
and
plenty
of
room
he
need
pay
no
heavy
rent
for
shop
and
no
disadvantages
from
confined
situation
and
then
by
attending
three
or
four
or
five
or
six
fairs
in
a
year
he
sold
the
work
of
his
hands
unloaded
with
a
heavy
expense
attending
the
keeping
of
a
shop
he
would
get
more
for
ten
shillings
in
a
booth
at
a
fair
or
market
than
he
would
get
in
a
shop
for
ten
or
twenty
pounds
of
course
he
could
afford
to
sell
the
work
of
his
hands
for
less
and
thus
a
greater
portion
of
their
earnings
remained
with
those
who
raised
the
food
and
the
clothing
from
the
land
i
had
an
instance
of
this
in
what
occurred
to
myself
at
weyhill
fair
when
i
was
at
salisbury
in
september
i
wanted
to
buy
a
whip
it
was
a
common
with
a
hook
to
it
to
pull
open
gates
with
and
i
could
not
get
it
for
less
than
seven
shillings
and
sixpence
this
was
more
than
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
give
and
i
went
on
with
my
switch
when
we
got
to
weyhill
fair
george
had
made
shift
to
lose
his
whip
some
time
before
and
i
had
made
him
go
without
one
by
way
of
punishment
but
now
having
come
to
the
fair
and
seeing
plenty
of
whips
i
bought
him
one
just
such
a
one
as
had
been
offered
me
at
salisbury
for
seven
and
sixpence
for
four
and
sixpence
and
seeing
the
man
with
his
whips
afterwards
i
thought
i
would
have
one
myself
and
he
let
me
have
it
for
three
shillings
so
that
here
were
two
whips
precisely
of
the
same
kind
and
quality
as
the
whip
at
salisbury
bought
for
the
money
which
the
man
at
salisbury
asked
me
for
one
whip
and
yet
far
be
it
from
me
to
accuse
the
man
at
salisbury
of
an
attempt
at
extortion
he
had
an
expensive
shop
and
a
family
in
a
town
to
support
while
my
weyhill
fellow
had
been
making
his
whips
in
some
house
in
the
country
which
he
rented
probably
for
five
or
six
pounds
a
year
with
a
good
garden
to
it
does
not
every
one
see
in
a
minute
how
this
exchanging
of
fairs
and
markets
for
shops
creates
and
creates
those
locusts
called
who
create
nothing
who
add
to
the
value
of
nothing
who
improve
nothing
but
who
live
in
idleness
and
who
live
well
too
out
of
the
labour
of
the
producer
and
the
consumer
the
fair
and
the
market
those
wise
institutions
of
our
forefathers
and
with
regard
to
the
management
of
which
they
were
so
scrupulously
careful
the
fair
and
the
market
bring
the
producer
and
the
consumer
in
contact
with
each
other
whatever
is
gained
is
at
any
rate
gained
by
one
or
the
other
of
these
the
fair
and
the
market
bring
them
together
and
enable
them
to
act
for
their
mutual
interest
and
convenience
the
shop
and
the
trafficker
keeps
them
apart
the
shop
hides
from
both
producer
and
consumer
the
real
state
of
matters
the
fair
and
the
market
lay
everything
open
going
to
either
you
see
the
state
of
things
at
once
and
the
transactions
are
fair
and
just
not
disfigured
too
by
falsehood
and
by
those
attempts
at
deception
which
disgrace
traffickings
in
general
very
wise
too
and
very
just
were
the
laws
against
and
they
were
laws
to
prevent
the
producer
and
the
consumer
from
being
cheated
by
the
trafficker
there
are
whole
bodies
of
men
indeed
a
very
large
part
of
the
community
who
live
in
idleness
in
this
country
in
consequence
of
the
whole
current
of
the
laws
now
running
in
favour
of
the
trafficking
monopoly
it
has
been
a
great
object
with
all
wise
governments
in
all
ages
from
the
days
of
moses
to
the
present
day
to
confine
trafficking
mere
trafficking
to
as
few
hands
as
possible
it
seems
to
be
the
main
object
of
this
government
to
give
all
possible
encouragement
to
traffickers
of
every
description
and
to
make
them
swarm
like
the
lice
of
egypt
there
is
that
numerous
sect
the
quakers
this
sect
arose
in
england
they
were
engendered
by
the
jewish
system
of
usury
till
and
began
these
vermin
were
never
heard
of
in
england
they
seem
to
have
been
hatched
by
that
fraudulent
system
as
maggots
are
bred
by
putrid
meat
or
as
the
flounders
come
in
the
livers
of
rotten
sheep
the
base
vermin
do
not
pretend
to
work
all
they
talk
about
is
dealing
and
the
government
in
place
of
making
laws
that
would
put
them
in
the
stocks
or
cause
them
to
be
whipped
at
the
cart
tail
really
seem
anxious
to
encourage
them
and
to
increase
their
numbers
nay
it
is
not
long
since
brougham
had
the
effrontery
to
move
for
leave
to
bring
in
a
bill
to
make
men
liable
to
be
hanged
upon
the
bare
word
of
these
vagabonds
this
is
with
me
something
never
to
be
forgotten
but
everything
tends
the
same
way
all
the
regulations
all
the
laws
that
have
been
adopted
of
late
years
have
a
tendency
to
give
encouragement
to
the
trickster
and
the
trafficker
and
to
take
from
the
labouring
classes
all
the
honour
and
a
great
part
of
the
food
that
fairly
belonged
to
them
in
coming
along
yesterday
from
waltham
chase
to
soberton
down
we
passed
by
a
big
white
house
upon
a
hill
that
was
when
i
lived
at
botley
occupied
by
one
goodlad
who
was
a
cock
justice
of
the
peace
and
who
had
been
a
chap
of
some
sort
or
other
in
there
was
a
man
of
the
name
of
singleton
who
lived
in
waltham
chase
and
who
was
deemed
to
be
a
great
poacher
this
man
having
been
forcibly
ousted
by
the
order
of
this
goodlad
and
some
others
from
an
encroachment
that
he
had
made
in
the
forest
threatened
revenge
soon
after
this
a
horse
i
forget
to
whom
it
belonged
was
stabbed
or
shot
in
the
in
a
field
singleton
was
taken
up
tried
at
winchester
convicted
and
i
can
not
relate
exactly
what
took
place
i
remember
that
there
were
some
curious
circumstances
attending
the
conviction
of
this
man
the
people
in
that
neighbourhood
were
deeply
impressed
with
these
circumstances
singleton
was
transported
but
goodlad
and
his
wife
were
both
dead
and
buried
in
less
i
believe
than
three
months
after
the
departure
of
poor
singleton
i
do
not
know
that
any
injustice
really
was
done
but
i
do
know
that
a
great
impression
was
produced
and
a
very
sorrowful
impression
too
on
the
minds
of
the
people
in
that
neighbourhood
i
can
not
quit
waltham
chase
without
observing
that
i
heard
last
year
that
a
bill
was
about
to
be
petitioned
for
to
enclose
that
chase
never
was
so
monstrous
a
proposition
in
this
world
the
bishop
of
winchester
is
lord
of
the
manor
over
this
chase
if
the
chase
be
enclosed
the
timber
must
be
cut
down
young
and
old
and
here
are
a
couple
of
hundred
acres
of
land
worth
ten
thousand
acres
of
land
in
the
new
forest
this
is
as
fine
timber
land
as
any
in
the
wealds
of
surrey
sussex
or
kent
there
are
two
enclosures
of
about
acres
each
perhaps
that
were
simply
surrounded
by
a
bank
being
thrown
up
about
twenty
years
ago
only
twenty
years
ago
and
on
the
poorest
part
of
the
chase
too
and
these
are
now
as
beautiful
plantations
of
young
oak
trees
as
man
ever
set
his
eyes
on
many
of
them
as
big
or
bigger
round
than
my
thigh
therefore
besides
the
sweeping
away
of
two
or
three
hundred
cottages
besides
plunging
into
ruin
and
misery
all
these
numerous
families
here
is
one
of
the
finest
pieces
of
timber
land
in
the
whole
kingdom
going
to
be
cut
up
into
miserable
clay
fields
for
no
earthly
purpose
but
that
of
gratifying
the
stupid
greediness
of
those
who
think
that
they
must
gain
if
they
add
to
the
breadth
of
their
private
fields
but
if
a
thing
like
this
be
permitted
we
must
be
prettily
furnished
with
commissioners
of
woods
and
forests
i
do
not
believe
that
they
will
sit
in
parliament
and
see
a
bill
like
this
passed
and
hold
their
tongues
but
if
they
were
to
do
it
there
is
no
measure
of
reproach
which
they
would
not
merit
let
them
go
and
look
at
the
two
plantations
of
oaks
of
which
i
have
just
spoken
and
then
let
them
give
their
consent
to
such
a
bill
if
they
can
monday
evening
when
i
left
weston
my
intention
was
to
go
from
hambledon
to
up
park
thence
to
arundel
thence
to
brighton
thence
to
thence
to
wittersham
in
kent
and
then
by
cranbrook
tunbridge
godstone
and
reigate
to
london
but
when
i
got
to
botley
and
particularly
when
i
got
to
hambledon
i
found
my
horse
back
so
much
hurt
by
the
saddle
that
i
was
afraid
to
take
so
long
a
stretch
and
therefore
resolved
to
come
away
straight
to
this
place
to
go
hence
to
reigate
and
so
to
london
our
way
therefore
this
morning
was
over
to
petersfield
in
the
first
place
then
to
lyphook
and
then
to
this
place
in
all
about
miles
belongs
to
the
back
chain
of
the
south
downs
and
indeed
it
terminates
that
chain
to
the
westward
it
is
the
highest
hill
in
the
whole
country
some
think
that
hindhead
which
is
the
famous
over
which
the
portsmouth
road
goes
at
sixteen
miles
to
the
north
of
this
great
some
think
that
hindhead
is
the
highest
hill
of
the
two
be
this
as
it
may
which
is
the
hill
of
the
two
between
which
you
go
at
three
miles
from
petersfield
going
towards
portsmouth
this
is
i
say
quite
high
enough
and
was
more
than
high
enough
for
us
for
it
took
us
up
amongst
clouds
that
wet
us
very
nearly
to
the
skin
in
going
from
goldsmith
to
the
hill
it
is
all
up
hill
for
five
miles
now
and
then
a
little
stoop
not
much
but
regularly
with
these
little
exceptions
up
hill
for
these
five
miles
the
hill
appears
at
a
distance
to
be
a
sharp
ridge
on
its
top
it
is
however
not
so
it
is
in
some
parts
half
a
mile
wide
or
more
the
road
lies
right
along
the
middle
of
it
from
west
to
east
and
just
when
you
are
at
the
highest
part
of
the
hill
it
is
very
narrow
from
north
to
south
not
more
i
think
than
about
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
thirty
yards
this
is
as
interesting
a
spot
i
think
as
the
foot
of
man
ever
was
placed
upon
here
are
two
valleys
one
to
your
right
and
the
other
to
your
left
very
little
less
than
half
a
mile
down
to
the
bottom
of
them
and
much
steeper
than
a
tiled
roof
of
a
house
these
valleys
may
be
where
they
join
the
hill
three
or
four
hundred
yards
broad
they
get
wider
as
they
get
farther
from
the
hill
of
a
clear
day
you
see
all
the
north
of
hampshire
nay
the
whole
county
together
with
a
great
part
of
surrey
and
of
sussex
you
see
the
whole
of
the
south
downs
to
the
eastward
as
far
as
your
eye
can
carry
you
and
lastly
you
see
over
portsdown
hill
which
lies
before
you
to
the
south
and
there
are
spread
open
to
your
view
the
isle
of
portsea
porchester
wimmering
fareham
gosport
portsmouth
the
harbour
spithead
the
isle
of
wight
and
the
ocean
but
something
still
more
interesting
occurred
to
me
here
in
the
year
when
i
was
coming
on
horseback
over
the
same
hill
from
botley
to
london
it
was
a
very
beautiful
day
and
in
summer
before
i
got
upon
the
hill
on
which
i
had
never
been
before
a
shepherd
told
me
to
keep
on
in
the
road
in
which
i
was
till
i
came
to
the
london
turnpike
road
when
i
got
to
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
this
particular
point
of
the
hill
i
saw
at
this
point
what
i
thought
was
a
cloud
of
dust
and
speaking
to
my
servant
about
it
i
found
that
he
thought
so
too
but
this
cloud
of
dust
disappeared
all
at
once
soon
after
there
appeared
to
arise
another
cloud
of
dust
at
the
same
place
and
then
that
disappeared
and
the
spot
was
clear
again
as
we
were
trotting
along
a
pretty
smart
pace
we
soon
came
to
this
narrow
place
having
one
valley
to
our
right
and
the
other
valley
to
our
left
and
there
to
my
great
astonishment
i
saw
the
clouds
come
one
after
another
each
appearing
to
be
about
as
big
as
two
or
three
acres
of
land
skimming
along
in
the
valley
on
the
north
side
a
great
deal
below
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
successively
as
they
arrived
at
our
end
of
the
valley
rising
up
crossing
the
narrow
pass
and
then
descending
down
into
the
other
valley
and
going
off
to
the
south
so
that
we
who
sate
there
upon
our
horses
were
alternately
in
clouds
and
in
sunshine
it
is
an
universal
rule
that
if
there
be
a
fog
in
the
morning
and
that
fog
go
from
the
valleys
to
the
tops
of
the
hills
there
will
be
rain
that
day
and
if
it
disappear
by
sinking
in
the
valley
there
will
be
no
rain
that
day
the
truth
is
that
fogs
are
clouds
and
clouds
are
fogs
they
are
more
or
less
full
of
water
but
they
are
all
water
sometimes
a
sort
of
steam
and
sometimes
water
that
falls
in
drops
yesterday
morning
the
fogs
had
ascended
to
the
tops
of
the
hills
and
it
was
raining
on
all
the
hills
round
about
us
before
it
began
to
rain
in
the
valleys
we
as
i
observed
before
got
pretty
nearly
wet
to
the
skin
upon
the
top
of
but
we
had
the
pluck
to
come
on
and
let
the
clothes
dry
upon
our
backs
i
must
here
relate
something
that
appears
very
interesting
to
me
and
something
which
though
it
must
have
been
seen
by
every
man
that
has
lived
in
the
country
or
at
least
in
any
hilly
country
has
never
been
particularly
mentioned
by
anybody
as
far
as
i
can
recollect
we
frequently
talk
of
clouds
coming
from
and
we
actually
see
the
heavy
fogs
become
clouds
we
see
them
go
up
to
the
tops
of
hills
and
taking
a
swim
round
actually
come
and
drop
down
upon
us
and
wet
us
through
but
i
am
now
going
to
speak
of
clouds
coming
out
of
the
sides
of
hills
in
exactly
the
same
manner
that
you
see
smoke
come
out
of
a
tobacco
pipe
and
rising
up
with
a
wider
and
wider
head
like
the
smoke
from
a
go
to
the
top
of
the
hill
or
over
the
hill
or
very
much
above
it
and
then
come
over
the
valleys
in
rain
at
about
a
distance
from
palmer
house
at
bollitree
in
herefordshire
there
is
a
large
long
beautiful
wood
covering
the
side
of
a
lofty
hill
winding
round
in
the
form
of
a
crescent
the
bend
of
the
crescent
being
towards
palmer
house
it
was
here
that
i
first
observed
this
mode
of
forming
clouds
the
first
time
i
noticed
it
i
pointed
it
out
to
palmer
we
stood
and
observed
cloud
after
cloud
come
out
from
different
parts
of
the
side
of
the
hill
and
tower
up
and
go
over
the
hill
out
of
sight
he
told
me
that
that
was
a
certain
sign
that
it
would
rain
that
day
for
that
these
clouds
would
come
back
again
and
would
fall
in
rain
it
rained
sure
enough
and
i
found
that
the
country
people
all
round
about
had
this
mode
of
the
forming
of
the
clouds
as
a
sign
of
rain
the
hill
is
called
penyard
and
this
forming
of
the
clouds
they
call
old
penyard
his
and
it
is
a
rule
that
it
is
sure
to
rain
during
the
day
if
old
penyard
smokes
his
pipe
in
the
morning
these
appearances
take
place
especially
in
warm
and
sultry
weather
it
was
very
warm
yesterday
morning
it
had
thundered
violently
the
evening
before
we
felt
it
hot
even
while
the
rain
fell
upon
us
at
petersfield
lies
in
a
pretty
broad
and
very
beautiful
valley
on
three
sides
of
it
are
very
lofty
hills
partly
downs
and
partly
covered
with
trees
and
as
we
proceeded
on
our
way
from
the
bottom
of
to
petersfield
we
saw
thousands
upon
thousands
of
clouds
continually
coming
puffing
out
from
different
parts
of
these
hills
and
towering
up
to
the
top
of
them
i
stopped
george
several
times
to
make
him
look
at
them
to
see
them
come
puffing
out
of
the
chalk
downs
as
well
as
out
of
the
woodland
hills
and
bade
him
remember
to
tell
his
father
of
it
when
he
should
get
home
to
convince
him
that
the
hills
of
hampshire
could
smoke
their
pipes
as
well
as
those
of
herefordshire
this
is
a
really
curious
matter
i
have
never
read
in
any
book
anything
to
lead
me
to
suppose
that
the
observation
has
ever
found
its
way
into
print
before
sometimes
you
will
see
only
one
or
two
clouds
during
a
whole
morning
come
out
of
the
side
of
a
hill
but
we
saw
thousands
upon
thousands
bursting
out
one
after
another
in
all
parts
of
these
immense
hills
the
first
time
that
i
have
leisure
when
i
am
in
the
high
countries
again
i
will
have
a
conversation
with
some
old
shepherd
about
this
matter
if
he
can
not
enlighten
me
upon
the
subject
i
am
sure
that
no
philosopher
can
we
came
through
petersfield
without
stopping
and
baited
our
horses
at
lyphook
where
we
stayed
about
half
an
hour
in
coming
from
lyphook
to
this
place
we
overtook
a
man
who
asked
for
relief
he
told
me
he
was
a
weaver
and
as
his
accent
was
northern
i
was
about
to
give
him
the
balance
that
i
had
in
hand
arising
from
our
savings
in
the
fasting
way
amounting
to
about
three
shillings
and
sixpence
but
unfortunately
for
him
i
asked
him
what
place
he
had
lived
at
as
a
weaver
and
he
told
me
that
he
was
a
spitalfields
weaver
i
instantly
put
on
my
glove
and
returned
my
purse
into
my
pocket
saying
go
then
to
sidmouth
and
peel
and
the
rest
of
them
and
get
relief
for
i
have
this
minute
while
i
was
stopping
at
lyphook
read
in
the
newspaper
an
address
to
the
king
from
the
spitalfields
weavers
for
which
address
they
ought
to
suffer
death
from
starvation
in
that
address
those
base
wretches
tell
the
king
that
they
were
loyal
men
that
they
detested
the
designing
men
who
were
guilty
of
seditious
practices
in
they
in
short
express
their
approbation
of
the
bill
of
all
the
deeds
committed
against
the
reformers
in
and
they
by
fair
inference
express
their
approbation
of
the
thanks
given
to
the
manchester
yeomanry
you
are
one
of
them
my
name
is
william
cobbett
and
i
would
sooner
relieve
a
dog
than
relieve
you
just
as
i
was
closing
my
harangue
we
overtook
a
and
woman
that
were
going
the
same
way
the
weaver
attempted
explanations
he
said
that
they
only
said
it
in
order
to
get
relief
but
that
they
did
not
mean
it
in
their
hearts
oh
base
dogs
said
i
it
is
precisely
by
such
men
that
ruin
is
brought
upon
nations
it
is
precisely
by
such
baseness
and
insincerity
such
scandalous
cowardice
that
ruin
has
been
brought
upon
them
i
had
two
or
three
shillings
to
give
you
i
had
them
in
my
hand
i
have
put
them
back
into
my
purse
i
trust
i
shall
find
somebody
more
worthy
of
them
rather
than
give
them
to
you
i
would
fling
them
into
that
and
bury
them
for
ever
how
curiously
things
happen
it
was
by
mere
accident
that
i
took
up
a
newspaper
to
read
it
was
merely
because
i
was
compelled
to
stay
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
the
room
without
doing
anything
and
above
all
things
it
was
miraculous
that
i
should
take
up
the
into
which
i
believe
i
never
before
looked
in
my
whole
life
i
saw
the
royal
arms
at
the
top
of
the
paper
took
it
for
the
and
in
a
sort
of
lounging
mood
said
to
george
give
me
hold
of
that
paper
and
let
us
see
what
that
foolish
devil
anna
brodie
says
seeing
the
words
i
read
on
till
i
got
to
the
base
and
scoundrelly
part
of
the
address
i
then
turned
over
and
looked
at
the
title
of
the
paper
and
the
date
of
it
resolving
in
my
mind
to
have
satisfaction
of
some
sort
or
other
upon
these
base
vagabonds
little
did
i
think
that
an
opportunity
would
so
soon
occur
of
showing
my
resentment
against
them
and
that
too
in
so
striking
so
appropriate
and
so
efficient
a
manner
i
dare
say
that
it
was
some
scoundrel
who
drew
up
this
address
which
i
will
insert
in
the
register
as
soon
as
i
can
find
it
but
that
is
nothing
to
me
and
my
fellow
sufferers
of
and
this
infamous
libel
upon
us
is
published
under
the
name
of
the
spitalfields
weavers
and
if
i
am
asked
what
the
poor
creatures
were
to
do
being
without
bread
as
they
were
i
answer
by
asking
whether
they
could
find
no
knives
to
cut
their
throats
with
seeing
that
they
ought
to
have
cut
their
throats
ten
thousand
times
over
if
they
could
have
done
it
rather
than
sanction
the
publication
of
so
infamous
a
paper
as
this
it
is
not
thus
that
the
weavers
in
the
north
have
acted
some
scoundrel
wanted
to
inveigle
them
into
an
applauding
of
the
ministers
but
they
though
nothing
so
infamous
as
this
address
was
proposed
to
them
rejected
the
proposition
though
they
were
ten
times
more
in
want
than
the
weavers
of
spitalfields
have
ever
been
they
were
only
called
upon
to
applaud
the
ministers
for
the
recent
orders
in
council
but
they
justly
said
that
the
ministers
had
a
great
deal
more
to
do
before
they
would
merit
their
applause
what
would
these
brave
and
sensible
men
have
said
to
a
scoundrel
who
should
have
called
upon
them
to
present
an
address
to
the
king
and
in
that
address
to
applaud
the
terrible
deeds
committed
against
the
people
in
and
i
have
great
happiness
in
reflecting
that
this
baseness
of
the
spitalfields
weavers
will
not
bring
them
one
single
mouthful
of
bread
this
will
be
their
lot
this
will
be
the
fruit
of
their
baseness
and
the
nation
the
working
classes
of
the
nation
will
learn
from
this
that
the
way
to
get
redress
of
their
grievances
the
way
to
get
food
and
raiment
in
exchange
for
their
labour
the
way
to
ensure
good
treatment
from
the
government
is
not
to
crawl
to
that
government
to
lick
its
hands
and
seem
to
deem
it
an
honour
to
be
its
slaves
before
we
got
to
thursley
i
saw
three
poor
fellows
getting
in
turf
for
their
winter
fuel
and
i
gave
them
a
shilling
apiece
to
a
boy
at
the
bottom
of
hindhead
i
gave
the
other
sixpence
towards
buying
him
a
pair
of
gloves
and
thus
i
disposed
of
the
money
which
was
at
one
time
actually
out
of
my
purse
and
going
into
the
hand
of
the
loyal
spitalfields
weaver
we
got
to
this
place
knowles
of
thursley
about
in
the
evening
very
much
delighted
with
our
ride
thursday
we
left
knowles
on
thursday
morning
came
through
godalming
stopped
at
rowland
at
chilworth
and
then
came
on
through
dorking
to
colley
farm
near
reigate
where
we
slept
i
have
so
often
described
the
country
from
hindhead
to
the
foot
of
reigate
hill
and
from
the
top
of
reigate
hill
to
the
thames
that
i
shall
not
attempt
to
do
it
again
here
when
we
got
to
the
river
wey
we
crossed
it
from
godalming
pismarsh
to
come
up
to
chilworth
i
desired
george
to
look
round
the
country
and
asked
him
if
he
did
not
think
it
was
very
pretty
i
put
the
same
question
to
him
when
we
got
into
the
beautiful
neighbourhood
of
dorking
and
when
we
got
to
reigate
and
especially
when
we
got
to
the
of
reigate
hill
from
which
there
is
one
of
the
finest
views
in
the
whole
world
but
ever
after
our
quitting
knowles
george
insisted
that
that
was
the
prettiest
country
that
we
had
seen
in
the
course
of
our
whole
ride
and
that
he
liked
knowles
place
better
than
any
other
place
that
he
had
seen
i
reminded
him
of
weston
grove
and
i
reminded
him
of
the
beautiful
ponds
and
grass
and
plantations
at
leach
but
he
still
persisted
in
his
judgment
in
favour
of
knowles
place
in
which
decision
however
the
greyhounds
and
the
beagles
had
manifestly
a
great
deal
to
do
from
thursley
to
reigate
inclusive
on
the
as
well
as
on
the
the
crops
of
turnips
of
both
kinds
were
pretty
nearly
as
good
as
i
ever
saw
them
in
my
life
on
a
farm
of
drummond
at
aldbury
rented
by
a
farmer
peto
i
saw
a
piece
of
cabbages
of
the
large
kind
which
will
produce
i
should
think
not
much
short
of
five
and
twenty
tons
to
the
acre
and
here
i
must
mention
i
do
not
know
i
must
by
the
bye
an
instance
of
my
own
skill
in
measuring
land
by
the
eye
the
cabbages
stand
upon
half
a
field
and
on
the
part
of
it
furthest
from
the
road
where
we
were
we
took
the
liberty
to
open
the
gate
and
ride
into
the
field
in
order
to
get
closer
to
the
cabbages
to
look
at
them
i
intended
to
notice
this
piece
of
cabbages
and
i
asked
george
how
much
ground
he
thought
there
was
in
the
piece
he
said
and
asked
me
how
much
i
thought
i
said
that
there
were
four
and
that
i
should
not
wonder
if
there
were
acres
and
a
thus
divided
in
judgment
we
turned
away
from
the
cabbages
to
go
out
of
the
field
at
another
gate
which
pointed
towards
our
road
near
this
gate
we
found
a
man
turning
a
heap
of
manure
this
man
as
it
happened
had
hoed
the
cabbages
by
the
acre
or
had
had
a
hand
in
it
we
asked
him
how
much
ground
there
was
in
that
piece
of
cabbages
and
he
told
us
acres
and
a
i
suppose
it
will
not
be
difficult
to
convince
the
reader
that
george
looked
upon
me
as
a
sort
of
conjuror
at
pym
at
colley
farm
we
found
one
of
the
very
finest
pieces
of
mangel
wurzel
that
i
had
ever
seen
in
my
life
we
calculated
that
there
would
be
little
short
of
tons
to
the
and
there
being
three
acres
to
the
piece
pym
calculates
that
this
mangel
wurzel
the
produce
of
these
three
acres
of
land
will
carry
his
ten
or
twelve
nearly
if
not
wholly
through
the
winter
there
did
not
appear
to
be
a
spurious
plant
and
there
was
not
one
plant
that
had
gone
to
seed
in
the
whole
piece
i
have
never
seen
a
more
beautiful
mass
of
vegetation
and
i
had
the
satisfaction
to
learn
after
having
admired
the
crop
that
the
seed
came
from
my
own
shop
and
that
it
had
been
saved
by
myself
talking
of
the
shop
i
came
to
it
in
a
very
few
hours
after
looking
at
this
mangel
wurzel
and
i
soon
found
that
it
was
high
time
for
me
to
get
home
again
for
here
had
been
pretty
devils
works
going
on
here
i
found
the
greek
cause
and
all
its
appendages
figuring
away
in
grand
style
but
i
must
make
this
matter
of
separate
observation
i
have
put
an
end
to
my
ride
of
august
september
and
october
during
which
i
have
travelled
five
hundred
and
miles
and
have
slept
in
thirty
different
beds
having
written
three
monthly
pamphlets
called
the
poor
man
friend
and
have
also
written
including
the
present
one
eleven
registers
i
have
been
in
three
cities
in
about
twenty
market
towns
in
perhaps
five
hundred
villages
and
i
have
seen
the
people
nowhere
so
well
off
as
in
the
neighbourhood
of
weston
grove
and
nowhere
so
badly
off
as
in
the
dominions
of
the
select
vestry
of
hurstbourn
tarrant
commonly
called
uphusband
during
the
whole
of
this
ride
i
have
very
rarely
been
after
i
have
drunk
neither
wine
nor
spirits
i
have
eaten
no
vegetables
and
only
a
very
moderate
quantity
of
meat
and
it
may
be
useful
to
my
readers
to
know
that
the
riding
of
twenty
miles
was
not
so
fatiguing
to
me
at
the
end
of
my
tour
as
the
riding
of
ten
miles
was
at
the
beginning
of
it
some
fools
will
call
this
why
is
it
egotism
getting
upon
a
good
strong
horse
and
riding
about
the
country
has
no
merit
in
it
there
is
no
conjuration
in
it
it
requires
neither
talents
nor
virtues
of
any
sort
but
is
a
very
valuable
thing
and
when
a
man
has
had
the
experience
which
i
have
had
in
this
instance
it
is
his
duty
to
state
to
the
world
and
to
his
own
countrymen
and
neighbours
in
particular
the
happy
effects
of
early
rising
sobriety
abstinence
and
a
resolution
to
be
active
it
is
his
duty
to
do
this
and
it
becomes
imperatively
his
duty
when
he
has
seen
in
the
course
of
his
life
so
many
men
so
many
men
of
excellent
hearts
and
of
good
talents
rendered
prematurely
old
cut
off
ten
or
twenty
years
before
their
time
by
a
want
of
that
early
rising
sobriety
abstinence
and
activity
from
which
he
himself
has
derived
so
much
benefit
and
such
inexpressible
pleasure
during
this
ride
i
have
been
several
times
wet
to
the
skin
at
some
times
of
my
life
after
having
indulged
for
a
long
while
in
codling
myself
up
in
the
house
these
soakings
would
have
frightened
me
half
out
of
my
senses
but
i
care
very
little
about
them
i
avoid
getting
wet
if
i
can
but
it
is
very
seldom
that
rain
come
when
it
would
has
prevented
me
from
performing
the
day
journey
that
i
had
laid
out
beforehand
and
this
is
a
very
good
rule
to
stick
to
your
intention
whether
it
be
attended
with
inconveniences
or
not
to
look
upon
yourself
as
to
do
it
in
the
whole
of
this
ride
i
have
met
with
no
one
untoward
circumstance
properly
so
called
except
the
wounding
of
the
back
of
my
horse
which
grieved
me
much
more
on
his
account
than
on
my
own
i
have
a
friend
who
when
he
is
disappointed
in
accomplishing
anything
that
he
has
laid
out
says
that
he
has
been
which
is
a
very
good
expression
for
the
thing
i
was
beaten
in
my
intention
to
go
through
sussex
and
kent
but
i
will
retrieve
the
affair
in
a
very
few
months
time
or
perhaps
few
weeks
the
collective
will
be
here
now
in
a
few
days
and
as
soon
as
i
have
got
the
preston
petition
fairly
before
them
and
find
as
i
dare
say
i
shall
that
the
petition
will
not
be
until
february
i
shall
take
my
horse
and
set
off
again
to
that
very
spot
in
the
london
at
the
foot
of
whence
i
turned
off
to
go
to
petersfield
instead
of
turning
the
other
way
to
go
to
up
park
i
shall
take
my
horse
and
go
to
this
spot
and
with
a
resolution
not
to
be
beaten
next
time
go
along
through
the
whole
length
of
sussex
and
sweep
round
through
kent
and
surrey
till
i
come
to
reigate
again
and
then
home
to
kensington
for
i
do
not
like
to
be
beaten
by
horse
sore
back
or
by
anything
else
and
besides
that
there
are
several
things
in
sussex
and
kent
that
i
want
to
see
and
give
an
account
of
for
the
present
however
farewell
to
the
country
and
now
for
the
wen
and
its
villanous
corruptions
rural
ride
to
tring
in
hertfordshire
farm
as
if
to
prove
the
truth
of
all
that
has
been
said
in
about
the
impolicy
of
cheap
planting
as
it
is
called
elliman
has
planted
another
and
larger
field
with
a
mixture
of
ash
locusts
and
larches
not
upon
ground
but
upon
ground
moved
with
the
plough
the
larches
made
great
haste
to
this
bequeathing
to
elliman
a
very
salutary
lesson
the
ash
appeared
to
be
alive
and
that
is
all
the
locusts
though
they
had
to
share
in
all
the
disadvantages
of
their
neighbours
appeared
it
seems
to
be
doing
pretty
well
and
had
made
decent
shoots
when
a
neighbour
sheep
invaded
the
plantation
and
being
fond
of
the
locust
leaves
and
shoots
as
all
cattle
are
reduced
them
to
mere
stumps
as
it
were
to
put
them
upon
a
level
with
the
ash
in
i
have
strongly
pressed
the
necessity
of
effectual
fences
without
these
you
plant
and
sow
in
vain
you
plant
and
sow
the
plants
and
seeds
of
disappointment
and
mortification
and
the
earth
being
always
grateful
is
sure
to
reward
you
with
a
plentiful
crop
one
half
acre
of
elliman
plantation
of
locusts
time
will
tell
him
is
worth
more
than
the
whole
of
the
six
or
seven
acres
of
this
planted
field
besides
the
trees
which
elliman
had
from
me
he
had
some
and
a
part
of
them
fine
plants
which
he
himself
had
raised
from
seed
in
the
manner
described
in
under
the
head
locust
this
seed
he
bought
from
me
and
as
i
shall
sell
but
a
very
few
more
locust
plants
i
recommend
gentlemen
to
sow
the
seed
for
themselves
according
to
the
directions
given
in
in
paragraphs
to
inclusive
in
that
part
of
will
be
found
the
most
minute
directions
for
the
sowing
of
this
seed
and
particularly
in
the
preparing
of
it
for
sowing
for
unless
the
proper
precautions
are
taken
here
one
seed
out
of
one
hundred
will
not
come
up
and
with
the
proper
precautions
one
seed
in
one
hundred
will
not
fail
to
come
up
i
beg
the
reader
who
intends
to
sow
locusts
to
read
with
great
care
the
latter
part
of
paragraph
of
at
this
town
of
tring
which
is
a
very
pretty
and
respectable
place
i
saw
what
reminded
me
of
another
of
my
endeavours
to
introduce
useful
things
into
this
country
at
the
door
of
a
shop
i
saw
a
large
with
the
lid
taken
off
containing
of
straw
for
it
was
straw
of
spring
wheat
tied
up
in
small
bundles
with
the
ear
on
just
such
as
i
myself
have
grown
in
england
many
times
and
bleached
for
platting
according
to
the
instructions
so
elaborately
given
in
the
last
edition
of
my
and
which
instructions
i
was
enabled
to
give
from
the
information
collected
by
my
son
in
america
i
asked
the
shopkeeper
where
he
got
this
straw
he
said
that
it
came
from
tuscany
and
that
it
was
manufactured
there
at
tring
and
other
places
for
as
i
understood
some
single
individual
i
told
the
shopkeeper
that
i
wondered
that
they
should
send
to
tuscany
for
the
straw
seeing
that
it
might
be
grown
harvested
and
equally
well
bleached
at
tring
that
it
was
now
at
this
time
grown
bleached
and
manufactured
into
bonnets
in
kent
and
i
showed
to
several
persons
at
tring
a
bonnet
made
in
kent
from
the
straw
of
wheat
grown
in
kent
and
presented
by
that
most
and
excellent
man
john
wood
of
wettersham
who
died
to
the
great
sorrow
of
the
whole
country
round
about
him
three
or
four
years
ago
he
had
taken
infinite
pains
with
this
matter
had
brought
a
young
woman
from
suffolk
at
his
own
expense
to
teach
the
children
at
wettersham
the
whole
of
this
manufacture
from
beginning
to
end
and
before
he
died
he
saw
as
handsome
bonnets
made
as
ever
came
from
tuscany
at
benenden
the
parish
in
which
hodges
resides
there
is
now
a
manufactory
of
the
same
sort
begun
in
the
first
place
under
the
benevolent
auspices
of
that
daughters
who
began
by
teaching
a
poor
fellow
who
had
been
a
cripple
from
his
infancy
who
was
living
with
a
poor
widowed
mother
and
who
is
now
the
master
of
a
school
of
this
description
in
the
beautiful
villages
of
benenden
and
rolvenden
in
kent
my
wife
wishing
to
have
her
bonnet
cleaned
some
time
ago
applied
to
a
person
who
performs
such
work
at
brighton
and
got
into
a
conversation
with
her
about
the
bonnets
the
woman
told
her
that
they
looked
very
well
at
first
but
that
they
would
not
retain
their
colour
and
added
they
will
not
clean
like
this
bonnet
that
you
have
she
was
left
with
a
request
to
clean
that
and
the
result
being
the
same
as
with
all
leghorn
bonnets
she
was
surprised
upon
being
told
that
that
was
an
english
leghorn
in
short
there
is
no
difference
at
all
in
the
two
and
if
these
people
at
tring
choose
to
grow
the
straw
instead
of
importing
it
from
leghorn
and
if
they
choose
to
make
plat
and
to
make
bonnets
just
as
beautiful
and
as
lasting
as
those
which
come
from
leghorn
they
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
read
my
cottage
economy
paragraph
to
paragraph
inclusive
where
they
will
find
as
plain
as
words
can
make
it
the
whole
mass
of
directions
for
taking
the
seed
of
the
wheat
and
converting
the
produce
into
bonnets
there
they
will
find
directions
first
as
to
the
sort
of
wheat
second
as
to
the
proper
land
for
growing
the
wheat
third
season
for
sowing
fourth
quantity
of
seed
to
the

and

of

seventh
manner
of

eighth
manner
of

ninth

tenth
manner
of

eleventh
manner
of
pressing
i
request
my
correspondents
to
inform
me
if
any
one
can
where
i
can
get
some
spring
wheat
the
botanical
name
of
it
is
it
is
sown
in
the
spring
at
the
same
time
that
barley
is
these
latin
words
mean
it
is
a
bearded
wheat
i
know
from
experience
that
the
little
winter
wheat
is
just
as
good
for
the
purpose
but
that
must
be
sown
earlier
and
there
is
danger
of
its
being
thinned
on
the
ground
by
worms
and
other
enemies
i
should
like
to
sow
some
this
next
spring
in
order
to
convince
the
people
of
tring
and
other
places
that
they
need
not
go
to
tuscany
for
the
straw
of
there
is
no
considerable
piece
in
the
neighbourhood
of
tring
but
i
saw
some
plants
even
upon
the
high
hill
where
the
locusts
are
growing
and
which
is
very
backward
land
which
appeared
to
be
about
as
forward
as
my
own
is
at
this
time
if
elliman
were
to
have
a
patch
of
good
corn
by
the
side
of
his
locust
trees
and
a
piece
of
spring
wheat
by
the
side
of
the
corn
people
might
then
go
and
see
specimens
of
the
three
great
undertakings
or
rather
great
additions
to
the
wealth
of
the
nation
introduced
under
the
name
of
i
am
the
more
desirous
of
introducing
this
manufacture
at
tring
on
account
of
the
very
marked
civility
which
i
met
with
at
that
place
a
very
excellent
friend
of
mine
who
is
professionally
connected
with
that
town
was
some
time
ago
apprised
of
my
intention
of
going
thither
to
see
elliman
plantation
he
had
mentioned
this
intention
to
some
gentlemen
of
that
town
and
neighbourhood
and
i
to
my
great
surprise
found
that
a
had
been
to
which
i
was
to
be
invited
i
never
like
to
disappoint
anybody
and
therefore
to
this
dinner
i
went
the
company
consisted
of
about
gentlemen
of
the
town
and
neighbourhood
and
certainly
though
i
have
been
at
dinners
in
several
parts
of
england
i
never
found
even
in
sussex
where
i
have
frequently
been
so
delighted
a
more
sensible
hearty
entertaining
and
hospitable
company
than
this
from
me
something
in
the
way
of
speech
was
expected
as
a
matter
of
course
and
though
i
was
from
a
cold
so
hoarse
as
not
to
be
capable
of
making
myself
heard
in
a
large
place
i
was
so
pleased
with
the
company
and
with
my
reception
that
first
and
last
i
dare
say
i
addressed
the
company
for
an
hour
and
a
half
we
dined
at
two
and
separated
at
nine
and
as
i
declared
at
parting
for
many
many
years
i
had
not
spent
a
happier
day
there
was
present
the
editor
or
some
other
gentleman
from
the
newspaper
called
bucks
gazette
and
general
who
has
published
in
his
paper
the
following
account
of
what
passed
at
the
dinner
as
far
as
the
report
goes
it
is
substantially
correct
and
though
this
gentleman
went
away
at
a
very
early
hour
that
which
he
has
given
of
my
speech
which
he
has
given
very
judiciously
contains
matter
which
can
hardly
fail
to
be
useful
to
great
numbers
of
his
readers
cobbett
at
tring
elliman
a
draper
at
tring
has
lately
formed
a
considerable
plantation
of
the
locust
tree
which
cobbett
claims
the
merit
of
having
introduced
into
this
country
the
number
he
has
planted
is
about
on
five
acres
and
a
half
of
very
indifferent
land
and
they
have
thrived
so
uncommonly
well
that
not
more
than
of
the
whole
number
have
failed
the
success
of
the
plantation
being
made
known
to
cobbett
induced
him
to
pay
a
visit
to
tring
to
inspect
it
and
during
his
sojourn
it
was
determined
upon
by
his
friends
to
give
him
a
dinner
at
the
rose
and
crown
inn
thursday
was
fixed
for
the
purpose
when
about
forty
persons
agriculturists
and
tradesmen
of
tring
and
the
neighbouring
towns
assembled
and
sat
down
to
a
dinner
served
up
in
very
excellent
style
by
northwood
the
landlord
mr
faithful
solicitor
of
tring
is
the
chair
the
usual
routine
toasts
having
been
given
the
chairman
said
he
was
sure
the
company
would
drink
the
toast
with
which
he
should
conclude
what
he
was
about
to
say
with
every
mark
of
respect
in
addressing
the
company
he
rose
under
feelings
of
no
ordinary
kind
for
he
was
about
to
give
the
health
of
a
gentleman
who
had
the
talent
of
communicating
to
his
writings
an
energy
and
perspicuity
which
he
had
never
met
with
elsewhere
who
conveyed
knowledge
in
a
way
so
clear
that
all
who
read
could
understand
he
the
chairman
had
read
the
political
register
from
the
first
of
them
to
the
last
with
pleasure
and
benefit
to
himself
and
he
would
defy
any
man
to
put
his
finger
upon
a
single
line
which
was
not
in
direct
support
of
a
kingly
government
he
advocated
the
rights
of
the
people
but
he
always
expressed
himself
favourable
to
our
ancient
form
of
government
he
certainly
had
strongly
but
not
too
strongly
attacked
the
corruption
of
the
government
but
had
never
attacked
its
form
or
its
just
powers
as
a
public
writer
he
considered
him
the
most
impartial
that
he
knew
he
well
recollected
he
knew
not
if
cobbett
himself
recollected
it
a
remarkable
passage
in
his
writings
he
was
speaking
of
the
pleasure
of
passing
from
censure
to
praise
and
thus
expressed
himself
is
turning
from
the
frowns
of
a
surly
winter
to
welcome
a
smiling
spring
come
dancing
over
the
daisied
lawn
crowned
with
garlands
and
surrounded
with
melody
nature
had
been
bountiful
to
him
it
had
blessed
him
with
a
constitution
capable
of
enduring
the
greatest
fatigues
and
a
mind
of
superior
order
brilliancy
it
was
said
was
a
mere
meteor
it
was
so
it
was
the
solidity
and
depth
of
understanding
such
as
he
possessed
that
were
really
valuable
he
had
visited
this
place
in
consequence
of
a
gentleman
having
been
wise
and
bold
enough
to
listen
to
his
advice
and
to
plant
a
large
number
of
locust
trees
and
he
trusted
he
would
enjoy
prosperity
and
happiness
in
duration
equal
to
that
of
the
wood
of
those
trees
he
concluded
by
giving
cobbett
health
cobbett
returned
thanks
for
the
manner
in
which
his
health
had
been
drunk
and
was
certain
that
the
trees
which
had
been
the
occasion
of
their
meeting
would
be
a
benefit
to
the
children
of
the
planter
though
it
might
appear
like
presumption
to
suppose
that
those
who
were
assembled
that
day
came
solely
in
compliment
to
him
yet
it
would
be
affectation
not
to
believe
that
it
was
expected
he
should
say
something
on
the
subject
of
politics
every
one
who
heard
him
was
convinced
that
there
was
something
wrong
and
that
a
change
of
some
sort
must
take
place
or
ruin
to
the
country
would
ensue
though
there
was
a
diversity
of
opinions
as
to
the
cause
of
the
distress
and
as
to
the
means
by
which
a
change
might
be
effected
and
though
some
were
not
so
deeply
affected
by
it
as
others
all
now
felt
that
a
change
must
take
place
before
long
whether
they
were
manufacturers
brewers
butchers
bakers
or
of
any
other
description
of
persons
they
had
all
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
there
must
be
a
change
it
would
be
presumptuous
to
suppose
that
many
of
those
assembled
did
not
understand
the
cause
of
the
present
distress
yet
there
were
many
who
did
not
and
those
gentlemen
who
did
he
begged
to
have
the
goodness
to
excuse
him
if
he
repeated
what
they
already
knew
politics
was
a
science
which
they
ought
not
to
have
the
trouble
of
studying
they
had
sufficient
to
do
in
their
respective
avocations
without
troubling
themselves
with
such
matters
for
what
were
the
ministers
and
a
whole
tribe
of
persons
under
them
paid
large
sums
of
money
from
the
country
but
for
the
purpose
of
governing
its
political
affairs
their
fitness
for
their
stations
was
another
thing
he
had
been
told
that
huskisson
was
so
ignorant
of
the
cause
of
the
distress
that
he
had
openly
said
he
should
be
glad
if
any
practical
man
would
tell
him
what
it
all
meant
if
any
man
present
were
to
profess
his
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
the
distress
it
would
be
no
disgrace
to
him
he
might
be
a
very
good
butcher
a
very
good
farmer
or
a
very
good
baker
he
might
well
understand
the
business
by
which
he
gained
his
living
and
if
any
one
should
say
to
him
because
he
did
not
understand
politics
are
a
very
stupid
fellow
he
might
fairly
reply
is
that
to
you
but
it
was
another
thing
to
those
who
were
so
well
paid
to
manage
the
affairs
of
the
country
to
plead
ignorance
of
the
cause
of
the
prevailing
distress
goulburn
with
a
string
of
figures
as
long
as
his
arm
had
endeavoured
to
prove
in
the
house
of
commons
that
the
withdrawal
of
the
notes
being
altogether
so
small
an
amount
little
more
than
two
millions
would
be
of
no
injury
to
the
country
and
that
its
only
effect
would
be
to
make
bankers
more
liberal
in
discounting
with
their
fives
he
would
appeal
to
the
company
if
they
had
found
this
to
be
the
case
goulburn
had
forgotten
that
the
notes
were
the
legs
upon
which
the
fives
walked
he
had
heard
the
duke
of
wellington
use
the
same
language
in
the
other
house
taught
as
they
now
were
by
experience
it
would
scarcely
be
believed
fifty
years
hence
that
a
set
of
men
could
have
been
found
with
so
little
foresight
as
to
have
devised
measures
so
fraught
with
injury
he
felt
convinced
that
if
he
looked
to
the
present
company
or
any
other
accidentally
assembled
that
he
would
find
thirteen
gentlemen
more
fit
to
manage
the
affairs
of
the
kingdom
than
were
those
who
now
presided
at
the
head
of
government
not
that
he
imputed
to
them
any
desire
to
do
wrong
or
that
they
were
more
corrupt
than
others
it
was
clear
that
with
the
eyes
of
the
public
upon
them
they
must
wish
to
do
right
it
was
owing
to
their
sheer
ignorance
their
entire
unfitness
to
carry
on
the
government
that
they
did
no
better
ignorance
and
unfitness
were
however
pleas
which
they
had
no
business
to
make
it
was
nothing
to
him
if
a
man
was
ignorant
and
stupid
under
ordinary
circumstances
but
if
he
entrusted
a
man
with
his
money
thinking
that
he
was
intelligent
and
was
deceived
then
it
was
something
he
had
a
right
to
say
are
not
what
i
took
you
for
you
are
an
ignorant
fellow
you
have
deceived
me
you
are
an
impostor
such
was
the
language
proper
to
all
under
such
circumstances
never
mind
their
titles
a
friend
had
that
morning
taken
him
to
view
the
beautiful
vale
of
aylesbury
which
he
had
never
before
seen
and
the
first
thought
that
struck
him
on
seeing
the
rich
pasture
was
this
god
is
a
country
like
this
to
be
ruined
by
the
folly
of
those
who
govern
it
when
he
was
a
naughty
boy
he
used
to
say
that
if
he
wanted
to
select
members
for
our
houses
of
parliament
he
would
put
a
string
across
any
road
leading
london
and
that
the
first
men
that
ran
against
his
string
he
would
choose
for
members
and
he
would
bet
a
wager
that
they
would
be
better
qualified
than
those
who
now
filled
those
houses
that
was
when
he
was
a
naughty
boy
but
since
that
time
a
bill
had
been
passed
which
made
it
banishment
for
life
to
use
language
that
brought
the
houses
of
parliament
into
contempt
and
therefore
he
did
not
say
so
now
the
government
it
should
be
recollected
had
passed
all
these
acts
with
the
hearty
concurrence
of
both
houses
of
parliament
they
were
thus
backed
by
these
houses
and
they
were
backed
by
out
of
one
hundred
of
the
papers
which
affected
to
see
all
their
acts
in
for
no
one
who
was
in
the
habit
of
reading
the
papers
could
have
anticipated
from
what
they
there
saw
the
ruin
which
had
fallen
on
the
country
thus
we
had
an
ignorant
government
an
ignorant
parliament
and
something
worse
than
an
ignorant
press
the
latter
being
employed
some
of
them
with
considerable
talent
to
assail
and
turn
into
ridicule
those
who
had
the
boldness
and
honesty
to
declare
their
dissent
from
the
opinion
of
the
wisdom
of
the
measures
of
government
it
was
no
easy
task
to
stand
unmoved
their
ridicule
and
sarcasms
and
many
were
thus
deterred
from
expressing
the
sentiments
of
their
minds
in
this
country
we
had
all
the
elements
of
prosperity
an
industrious
people
such
as
were
nowhere
else
to
be
found
a
country
too
which
was
once
called
the
finest
and
greatest
on
the
earth
for
whatever
might
be
said
of
the
country
in
comparison
with
others
the
turnips
of
england
were
worth
more
this
year
than
all
the
vines
of
france
it
was
a
glorious
and
a
great
country
until
the
government
had
made
it
otherwise
and
it
ought
still
to
be
what
it
once
was
and
to
be
capable
to
driving
the
russians
back
from
the
country
of
our
old
and
best
ally
the
turks
during
the
time
of
war
we
were
told
that
it
was
necessary
to
make
great
sacrifices
to
save
us
from
disgrace
the
people
made
those
sacrifices
they
gave
up
their
all
but
had
the
government
done
its
part
had
it
saved
us
from
disgrace
no
we
were
now
the
of
all
other
countries
the
french
and
all
other
nations
derided
us
and
by
and
by
it
would
be
seen
that
they
would
make
a
partition
of
turkey
with
the
russians
and
make
a
fresh
subject
for
laughter
never
since
the
time
of
charles
had
such
disgrace
been
brought
upon
the
country
and
why
was
this
when
were
we
again
to
see
the
labourer
receiving
his
wages
from
the
farmer
instead
of
being
sent
on
the
road
to
break
stones
some
people
under
this
state
of
things
consoled
themselves
by
saying
things
would
come
about
again
they
had
come
about
before
and
would
come
about
again
they
deceived
themselves
things
did
not
come
about
the
seasons
came
about
it
was
true
but
something
must
be
to
bring
things
about
instead
of
the
verb
to
speak
as
a
grammarian
they
should
use
the
they
should
not
say
things
will
about
but
things
must
be
about
he
thought
that
the
distress
would
shortly
become
so
great
perhaps
about
christmas
that
the
parliamentary
gentlemen
finding
they
received
but
a
small
part
of
their
rents
without
which
they
could
not
do
any
more
than
the
farmer
without
his
crops
would
endeavour
to
bring
them
about
and
the
measures
they
would
propose
for
that
purpose
as
far
as
he
could
judge
would
be
bank
restriction
and
the
of
notes
and
what
the
effect
of
that
would
be
they
would
soon
see
one
of
those
persons
who
were
so
profoundly
ignorant
would
come
down
to
the
house
prepared
to
propose
a
return
to
bank
restriction
and
the
issue
of
small
notes
and
a
bill
to
that
effect
would
be
passed
if
such
a
bill
did
pass
he
would
advise
all
persons
to
be
cautious
in
their
dealings
it
would
be
perilous
to
make
bargains
under
such
a
state
of
things
money
was
the
measure
of
value
but
if
this
measure
was
liable
to
be
three
times
as
large
at
one
time
as
at
another
who
could
know
what
to
do
how
was
any
one
to
know
how
to
purchase
wheat
if
the
bushel
was
to
be
altered
at
the
pleasure
of
the
government
to
three
times
its
present
size
the
remedy
for
the
evils
of
the
country
was
not
to
be
found
in
palliatives
it
was
not
to
be
found
in
strong
measures
the
first
step
must
be
taken
in
the
house
of
commons
but
that
was
almost
hopeless
for
although
many
persons
possessed
the
right
of
voting
it
was
of
little
use
to
them
whilst
a
few
great
men
could
render
their
votes
of
no
avail
if
we
had
possessed
a
house
of
commons
that
represented
the
feelings
and
wishes
of
the
people
they
would
not
have
submitted
to
much
of
what
had
taken
place
and
until
we
had
a
reform
we
should
never
he
believed
see
measures
emanating
from
that
house
which
would
conduce
to
the
glory
and
safety
of
the
country
he
feared
that
there
would
be
no
improvement
until
a
dreadful
convulsion
took
place
and
that
was
an
event
which
he
prayed
god
to
avert
from
the
country
the
chairman
proposed
to
when
cobbett
again
rose
and
said
the
chairman
had
told
him
he
was
entitled
to
give
a
sentiment
he
would
give
prosperity
to
the
towns
of
aylesbury
and
tring
but
he
would
again
advise
those
who
calculated
upon
the
return
of
prosperity
to
be
careful
until
there
was
an
equitable
adjustment
or
government
took
off
part
of
the
taxes
which
was
the
same
thing
there
could
be
no
return
of
prosperity
after
the
reporter
went
away
we
had
a
great
number
of
toasts
most
of
which
were
followed
by
more
or
less
of
speech
and
before
we
separated
i
think
that
the
seeds
of
common
sense
on
the
subject
of
our
distresses
were
pretty
well
planted
in
the
lower
part
of
hertfordshire
and
in
buckinghamshire
the
gentlemen
present
were
men
of
information
well
able
to
communicate
to
others
that
which
they
themselves
had
heard
and
i
endeavoured
to
leave
no
doubt
in
the
mind
of
any
man
that
heard
me
that
the
cause
of
the
distress
was
the
work
of
the
government
and
house
of
commons
and
that
it
was
nonsense
to
hope
for
a
cure
until
the
people
had
a
real
voice
in
the
choosing
of
that
house
i
think
that
these
truths
were
well
implanted
and
i
further
think
that
if
i
could
go
to
the
capital
of
every
county
in
the
kingdom
i
should
leave
no
doubt
in
the
minds
of
any
part
of
the
people
i
must
not
omit
to
mention
in
conclusion
that
though
i
am
no
eater
or
drinker
and
though
i
tasted
nothing
but
the
breast
of
a
little
chicken
and
drank
nothing
but
water
the
dinner
was
the
best
that
ever
i
saw
called
a
and
certainly
unreasonably
cheap
there
were
excellent
joints
of
meat
of
the
finest
description
fowls
and
geese
in
abundance
and
finally
a
very
fine
haunch
of
venison
with
a
bottle
of
wine
for
each
person
and
all
for
shillings
and
sixpence
per
good
waiting
upon
civil
landlord
and
landlady
and
in
short
everything
at
this
very
pretty
town
pleased
me
exceedingly
yet
what
is
tring
but
a
fair
specimen
of
english
towns
and
english
people
and
is
it
right
and
is
it
to
be
suffered
that
such
a
people
should
be
plunged
into
misery
by
the
acts
of
those
whom
they
pay
so
generously
and
whom
they
so
loyally
and
cheerfully
obey
as
far
as
i
had
an
opportunity
of
ascertaining
the
facts
the
farmers
feel
all
the
pinchings
of
distress
and
the
still
harsher
pinchings
of
anxiety
for
the
future
and
the
labouring
people
are
suffering
in
a
degree
not
to
be
described
the
shutting
of
the
male
paupers
up
in
pounds
is
common
through
bedfordshire
and
buckinghamshire
left
at
large
during
the
day
they
roam
about
and
maraud
what
are
the
farmers
to
do
with
them
god
knows
how
long
the
peace
is
to
be
kept
if
this
state
of
things
be
not
put
a
stop
to
the
natural
course
of
things
is
that
an
attempt
to
impound
the
paupers
in
cold
weather
will
produce
resistance
in
some
place
that
those
of
one
parish
will
be
joined
by
those
of
another
that
a
formidable
band
will
soon
be
assembled
then
will
ensue
the
rummaging
of
pantries
and
cellars
that
this
will
spread
from
parish
to
parish
and
that
finally
mobs
of
immense
magnitude
will
set
the
law
at
open
defiance
jails
are
next
to
useless
in
such
a
case
their
want
of
room
must
leave
the
greater
part
of
the
offenders
at
large
the
agonizing
distress
of
the
farmers
will
make
them
comparatively
indifferent
with
regard
to
these
violences
and
at
last
general
confusion
will
come
this
is
by
no
means
an
unlikely
progress
or
an
unlikely
result
it
therefore
becomes
those
who
have
much
at
stake
to
join
heartily
in
their
applications
to
government
for
a
timely
remedy
for
these
astounding
evils
northern
tour
january
on
the
instant
i
gave
my
third
lecture
at
leeds
i
should
in
vain
endeavour
to
give
an
adequate
description
of
the
pleasure
which
i
felt
at
my
reception
and
at
the
effect
which
i
produced
in
that
fine
and
opulent
capital
of
this
great
county
of
york
for
the
it
is
in
fact
though
not
in
name
on
the
first
evening
the
which
is
pretty
spacious
was
not
completely
filled
in
all
its
parts
but
on
the
second
and
the
third
it
was
filled
brim
full
boxes
pit
and
gallery
besides
a
dozen
or
two
of
gentlemen
who
were
accommodated
with
seats
on
the
stage
owing
to
a
cold
which
i
took
at
huddersfield
and
which
i
spoke
of
before
i
was
as
the
players
call
it
not
in
very
good
but
the
audience
made
allowance
for
that
and
very
wisely
preferred
sense
to
sound
i
never
was
more
delighted
than
with
my
audience
at
leeds
and
what
i
set
the
highest
value
on
is
that
i
find
i
produced
a
prodigious
effect
in
that
important
town
there
had
been
a
meeting
at
doncaster
a
few
days
before
i
went
to
leeds
from
ripley
where
one
of
the
speakers
a
becket
denison
had
said
speaking
of
the
taxes
that
there
must
be
an
application
of
the
or
of
the
this
gentleman
is
a
banker
i
believe
he
is
one
of
the
beckets
connected
with
the
lowthers
and
he
is
a
brother
or
very
near
relation
of
that
sir
john
becket
who
is
the
judge
advocate
general
so
that
at
last
others
can
talk
of
the
pruning
hook
and
the
sponge
as
well
as
i
from
leeds
i
proceeded
on
to
this
place
not
being
able
to
stop
at
either
wakefield
or
barnsley
except
merely
to
change
horses
the
people
in
those
towns
were
apprised
of
the
time
that
i
should
pass
through
them
and
at
each
place
great
numbers
assembled
to
see
me
to
shake
me
by
the
hand
and
to
request
me
to
stop
i
was
so
hoarse
as
not
to
be
able
to
make
the
hear
me
when
i
called
to
him
and
therefore
it
would
have
been
useless
to
stop
yet
i
promised
to
go
back
if
my
time
and
my
voice
would
allow
me
they
do
not
and
i
have
written
to
the
gentlemen
of
those
places
to
inform
them
that
when
i
go
to
scotland
in
the
spring
i
will
not
fail
to
stop
in
those
towns
in
order
to
express
my
gratitude
to
them
all
the
way
along
from
leeds
to
sheffield
it
is
coal
and
iron
and
iron
and
coal
it
was
dark
before
we
reached
sheffield
so
that
we
saw
the
iron
furnaces
in
all
the
horrible
splendour
of
their
everlasting
blaze
nothing
can
be
conceived
more
grand
or
more
terrific
than
the
yellow
waves
of
fire
that
incessantly
issue
from
the
top
of
these
furnaces
some
of
which
are
close
by
the
nature
has
placed
the
beds
of
iron
and
the
beds
of
coal
alongside
of
each
other
and
art
has
taught
man
to
make
one
to
operate
upon
the
other
as
to
turn
the
into
liquid
matter
which
is
drained
off
from
the
bottom
of
the
furnace
and
afterwards
moulded
into
blocks
and
bars
and
all
sorts
of
things
the
combustibles
are
put
into
the
top
of
the
furnace
which
stands
thirty
forty
or
fifty
feet
up
in
the
air
and
the
ever
blazing
mouth
of
which
is
kept
supplied
with
coal
and
coke
and
iron
stone
from
little
iron
wagons
forced
up
by
steam
and
brought
down
again
to
be
it
is
a
surprising
thing
to
behold
and
it
is
impossible
to
behold
it
without
being
convinced
that
whatever
other
nations
may
do
with
cotton
and
with
wool
they
will
never
equal
england
with
regard
to
things
made
of
iron
and
steel
this
sheffield
and
the
land
all
about
it
is
one
bed
of
iron
and
coal
they
call
it
black
sheffield
and
black
enough
it
is
but
from
this
one
town
and
its
environs
go
of
the
knives
that
are
used
in
the
whole
world
there
being
i
understand
no
knives
made
at
birmingham
the
manufacture
of
which
place
consists
of
the
larger
sort
of
implements
of
locks
of
all
sorts
and
guns
and
swords
and
of
all
the
endless
articles
of
hardware
which
go
to
the
furnishing
of
a
house
as
to
the
land
viewed
in
the
way
of
agriculture
it
really
does
appear
to
be
very
little
worth
i
have
not
seen
except
at
harewood
and
ripley
a
stack
of
wheat
since
i
came
into
yorkshire
and
even
there
the
whole
i
saw
and
all
that
i
have
seen
since
i
came
into
yorkshire
and
all
that
i
saw
during
a
ride
of
six
miles
that
i
took
into
derbyshire
the
day
before
yesterday
all
put
together
would
not
make
the
of
what
i
have
many
times
seen
in
one
single
of
the
vales
of
wiltshire
but
this
is
all
very
proper
these
and
and
compel
us
to
send
the
food
to
them
which
indeed
we
do
very
cheerfully
in
exchange
for
the
produce
of
their
rocks
and
the
wondrous
works
of
their
hands
the
trade
of
sheffield
has
fallen
off
less
in
proportion
than
that
of
the
other
manufacturing
districts
north
america
and
particularly
the
united
states
where
the
people
have
so
much
victuals
to
cut
form
a
great
branch
of
the
custom
of
this
town
if
the
people
of
sheffield
could
only
receive
a
tenth
part
of
what
their
knives
sell
for
by
retail
in
america
sheffield
might
pave
its
streets
with
silver
a
of
knives
and
forks
is
sold
to
the
americans
for
less
than
three
knives
and
forks
can
be
bought
at
retail
in
a
country
store
in
america
no
fear
of
rivalship
in
this
trade
the
americans
may
lay
on
their
tariff
and
double
it
and
triple
it
but
as
long
as
they
continue
to
their
victuals
from
sheffield
they
must
have
the
things
to
cut
it
with
the
ragged
hills
all
round
about
this
town
are
bespangled
with
groups
of
houses
inhabited
by
the
working
cutlers
they
have
not
suffered
like
the
working
weavers
for
to
make
knives
there
must
be
the
hand
of
man
therefore
machinery
can
not
come
to
destroy
the
wages
of
the
labourer
the
home
demand
has
been
very
much
diminished
but
still
the
depression
has
here
not
been
what
it
has
been
and
what
it
is
where
the
machinery
can
be
brought
into
play
we
are
here
just
upon
the
borders
of
derbyshire
a
nook
of
which
runs
up
and
separates
yorkshire
from
nottinghamshire
i
went
to
a
village
the
day
before
yesterday
called
the
whole
of
the
people
of
which
are
employed
in
the
making
of
and
and
where
as
i
was
told
they
are
very
well
off
even
in
these
times
a
prodigious
quantity
of
these
things
go
to
the
united
states
of
america
in
short
there
are
about
twelve
millions
of
people
there
continually
consuming
these
things
and
the
hardware
merchants
here
have
their
agents
and
their
stores
in
the
great
towns
of
america
which
country
as
far
as
relates
to
this
branch
of
business
is
still
a
part
of
old
england
upon
my
arriving
here
on
wednesday
night
the
instant
i
by
no
means
intended
to
lecture
until
i
should
be
a
little
recovered
from
my
cold
but
to
my
great
mortification
i
found
that
the
lecture
had
been
advertised
and
that
great
numbers
of
persons
had
actually
assembled
to
send
them
out
again
and
give
back
the
money
was
a
thing
not
to
be
attempted
i
therefore
went
to
the
music
hall
the
place
which
had
been
taken
for
the
purpose
gave
them
a
specimen
of
the
state
of
my
voice
asked
them
whether
i
should
proceed
and
they
answering
in
the
affirmative
on
i
went
i
then
rested
until
yesterday
and
shall
conclude
my
labours
here
and
then
proceed
to
as
we
used
to
sing
when
i
was
a
boy
in
celebrating
the
glorious
exploits
of
robin
hood
and
little
john
by
the
by
as
we
went
from
huddersfield
to
dewsbury
we
passed
by
a
hill
which
is
celebrated
as
being
the
of
the
famed
robin
hood
of
whom
the
people
in
this
country
talk
to
this
day
at
nottingham
they
have
advertised
for
my
lecturing
at
the
for
the
and
of
february
and
for
a
public
breakfast
to
be
given
to
me
on
the
first
of
those
days
i
having
declined
a
dinner
agreeably
to
my
original
notification
and
my
friends
insisting
upon
something
or
other
in
that
sort
of
way
it
is
very
curious
that
i
have
always
had
a
very
great
desire
to
see
nottingham
this
desire
certainly
originated
in
the
great
interest
that
i
used
to
take
and
that
all
country
boys
took
in
the
history
of
robin
hood
in
the
record
of
whose
achievements
which
were
so
well
calculated
to
excite
admiration
in
the
country
boys
this
nottingham
with
the
word
always
before
it
was
so
often
mentioned
the
word
as
used
by
our
forefathers
meant
fine
for
we
frequently
read
in
old
descriptions
of
parts
of
the
country
of
such
a
district
or
such
a
parish
containing
a
mansion
and
the
like
so
that
this
town
appears
to
have
been
celebrated
as
a
very
fine
place
even
in
ancient
times
but
within
the
last
thirty
years
nottingham
has
stood
high
in
my
estimation
from
the
conduct
of
its
people
from
their
public
spirit
from
their
excellent
sense
as
to
public
matters
from
the
noble
struggle
which
they
have
made
from
the
beginning
of
the
french
war
to
the
present
hour
if
only
forty
towns
in
england
equal
in
size
to
nottingham
had
followed
its
bright
example
there
would
have
been
no
french
war
against
liberty
the
debt
would
have
been
now
nearly
paid
off
and
we
should
have
known
nothing
of
those
manifold
miseries
which
now
afflict
and
those
greater
miseries
which
now
menace
the
country
the
french
would
not
have
been
in
cadiz
the
russians
would
not
have
been
at
constantinople
the
americans
would
not
have
been
in
the
floridas
we
should
not
have
had
to
dread
the
combined
fleets
of
america
france
and
russia
and
which
is
the
worst
of
all
we
should
not
have
seen
the
jails
four
times
as
big
as
they
were
and
should
not
have
seen
englishmen
reduced
to
such
a
state
of
misery
as
for
the
honest
labouring
man
to
be
fed
worse
than
the
felons
in
the
jails
eastern

you
permit
the
jews
openly
to
preach
in
their
synagogues

call
jesus

an
impostor

you

letter

published
in

of
january
march
i
set
off
from
london
on
the
of
march
got
to
bury
edmund
that
evening
and
to
my
great
mortification
saw
the
and
the
assizes
both
going
on
at
chelmsford
where
of
course
a
great
part
of
the
people
of
essex
were
met
if
i
had
been
aware
of
that
i
should
certainly
have
stopped
at
chelmsford
in
order
to
address
a
few
words
of
sense
to
the
unfortunate
constituents
of
western
at
bury
edmund
i
gave
a
lecture
on
the
ninth
and
another
on
the
tenth
of
march
in
the
playhouse
to
very
crowded
audiences
i
went
to
norwich
on
the
and
gave
a
lecture
there
on
that
evening
and
on
the
evening
of
the
the
audience
here
was
more
numerous
than
at
bury
edmund
but
not
so
numerous
in
proportion
to
the
size
of
the
place
and
contrary
to
what
has
happened
in
most
other
places
it
consisted
more
of
town
people
than
of
country
people
during
the
and
i
was
at
a
friend
house
at
yelverton
half
way
between
norwich
and
bungay
which
last
is
in
suffolk
and
at
which
place
i
lectured
on
the
to
an
audience
consisting
chiefly
of
farmers
and
was
entertained
there
in
a
most
hospitable
and
kind
manner
at
the
house
of
a
friend
the
next
day
being
the
i
went
to
eye
and
there
lectured
in
the
evening
in
the
neat
little
playhouse
of
the
place
which
was
crowded
in
every
part
stage
and
all
the
audience
consisted
almost
entirely
of
farmers
who
had
come
in
from
diss
from
harleston
and
from
all
the
villages
round
about
in
this
fertile
and
neighbourhood
i
stayed
at
eye
all
the
day
of
the
having
appointed
to
be
at
ipswich
on
the
eye
is
a
beautiful
little
place
though
an
exceedingly
rotten
borough
all
was
harmony
and
good
humour
everybody
appeared
to
be
of
one
mind
and
as
these
friends
observed
to
me
so
i
thought
that
more
effect
had
been
produced
by
this
one
lecture
in
that
neighbourhood
than
could
have
been
produced
in
a
whole
year
if
the
register
had
been
put
into
the
hands
of
every
one
of
the
hearers
during
that
space
of
time
for
though
i
never
attempt
to
put
forth
that
sort
of
stuff
which
the
intense
people
on
the
other
side
of
george
channel
call
i
bring
out
strings
of
very
interesting
facts
i
use
pretty
powerful
arguments
and
i
hammer
them
down
so
closely
upon
the
mind
that
they
seldom
fail
to
produce
a
lasting
impression
on
the
i
proceeded
to
ipswich
not
imagining
it
to
be
the
fine
populous
and
beautiful
place
that
i
found
it
to
be
on
that
night
and
on
the
night
of
the
i
lectured
to
boxes
and
pit
crowded
principally
with
opulent
farmers
and
to
a
gallery
filled
apparently
with
journeymen
tradesmen
and
their
wives
on
the
sunday
before
i
came
away
i
heard
from
all
quarters
that
my
audiences
had
retired
deeply
impressed
with
the
truths
which
i
had
endeavoured
to
inculcate
one
thing
however
occurred
towards
the
close
of
the
lecture
of
saturday
the
that
i
deem
worthy
of
particular
attention
in
general
it
would
be
useless
for
me
to
attempt
to
give
anything
like
of
these
speeches
of
mine
consisting
as
they
do
of
words
uttered
pretty
nearly
as
fast
as
i
can
utter
them
during
a
space
of
never
less
than
two
and
sometimes
of
nearly
three
hours
but
there
occurred
here
something
that
i
must
notice
i
was
speaking
of
by
which
the
established
church
had
been
losing
its
since
the
peace
first
the
removing
the
penal
act
which
forbade
an
impugning
of
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
second
the
repeal
of
the
which
declared
in
effect
that
the
religion
of
any
of
the
dissenters
was
as
good
as
that
of
the
church
of
england
third
the
repeal
of
the
penal
and
excluding
laws
with
regard
to
the
and
this
last
act
said
i
does
in
effect
declare
that
the
thing
called
the
was
no
said
one
gentleman
in
a
very
loud
voice
and
he
was
followed
by
four
or
five
more
who
said
no
no
then
said
i
we
will
if
you
like
put
it
the
understand
gentlemen
that
do
not
whatever
i
may
think
that
the
reformation
was
unnecessary
but
i
say
that
act
amounts
to
a
that
it
was
unnecessary
and
without
losing
our
good
humour
we
will
if
that
gentleman
choose
put
this
question
to
the
vote
i
paused
a
little
while
receiving
no
answer
and
perceiving
that
the
company
were
with
me
i
proceeded
with
my
speech
concluding
with
the
complete
demolishing
blow
which
the
church
would
receive
by
the

we
were
entertained
at
ipswich
by
a
very
kind
and
excellent
friend
whom
as
is
generally
the
case
i
had
never
seen
or
heard
of
before
the
morning
of
the
day
of
the
last
lecture
i
walked
about
five
miles
then
went
to
his
house
to
breakfast
and
stayed
with
him
and
dined
on
the
sunday
morning
before
i
came
away
i
walked
about
six
miles
and
repeated
the
good
cheer
at
breakfast
at
the
same
place
here
i
heard
the
first
singing
of
the
birds
this
year
and
i
here
observed
an
instance
of
that
which
apparently
pervades
the
whole
of
animated
nature
a
lark
very
near
to
me
in
a
ploughed
field
rose
from
the
ground
and
was
saluting
the
sun
with
his
delightful
song
he
was
got
about
as
high
as
the
dome
of
paul
having
me
for
a
motionless
and
admiring
auditor
when
the
hen
started
up
from
nearly
the
same
spot
whence
the
cock
had
risen
flew
up
and
passed
close
by
him
i
could
not
hear
what
she
said
but
supposed
that
she
must
have
given
him
a
pretty
smart
reprimand
for
down
she
came
upon
the
ground
and
he
ceasing
to
sing
took
a
twirl
in
the
air
and
came
down
after
her
others
have
i
dare
say
seen
this
a
thousand
times
over
but
i
never
observed
it
before
about
twelve
my
son
and
i
set
off
for
this
place
hargham
coming
through
needham
market
stowmarket
bury
edmund
and
thetford
at
which
latter
place
i
intended
to
have
lectured
and
where
the
theatre
was
to
have
been
the
scene
but
the
mayor
of
the
town
thought
it
best
not
to
give
his
permission
until
the
assizes
which
commence
the
should
be
over
lest
the
judge
should
take
offence
seeing
that
it
is
the
custom
while
his
lordship
is
in
the
town
to
give
up
the
civil
jurisdiction
to
him
bless
his
worship
what
in
all
the
world
should
he
think
would
take
me
to
thetford
it
being
a
time
for
holding
the
at
no
time
should
i
have
dreamed
of
finding
an
audience
in
so
small
a
place
and
in
a
country
so
thinly
inhabited
i
was
attracted
too
by
the
desire
of
meeting
some
of
my
from
the
wen
for
i
deal
in
arguments
founded
on
the
of
the
and
on
of
the
deuce
take
this
mayor
for
disappointing
me
and
now
i
am
afraid
that
i
shall
not
fall
in
with
this
learned
body
during
the
whole
of
my
spring
tour
finding
thetford
to
be
forbidden
ground
i
came
hither
to
sir
thomas
beevor
where
i
had
left
my
two
daughters
having
since
the
inclusive
travelled
miles
and
delivered
six
lectures
those
miles
have
been
through
a
fine
and
without
my
seeing
until
i
came
to
thetford
but
one
spot
of
waste
or
common
land
and
that
not
exceeding
i
should
think
from
fifty
to
eighty
acres
from
this
place
to
norwich
and
through
attleborough
and
wymondham
the
land
is
all
good
and
the
farming
excellent
it
is
pretty
nearly
the
same
from
norwich
to
bungay
where
we
enter
suffolk
bungay
is
a
large
and
fine
town
with
three
churches
lying
on
the
side
of
some
very
fine
meadows
harleston
on
the
road
to
eye
is
a
very
pretty
of
eye
i
have
spoken
before
from
eye
to
ipswich
we
pass
through
a
series
of
villages
and
at
ipswich
to
my
great
surprise
we
found
a
most
beautiful
town
with
a
population
of
about
twelve
thousand
persons
and
here
our
profound
prime
minister
might
have
seen
most
abundant
evidence
of
prosperity
for
the
are
indeed
very
numerous
but
if
our
famed
and
profound
prime
minister
having
wilmot
horton
by
the
arm
and
standing
upon
one
of
the
hills
that
surround
this
town
and
which
each
hill
seeming
to
surpass
the
other
hill
in
beauty
command
a
complete
view
of
every
house
or
at
least
of
the
top
of
every
house
in
this
opulent
town
if
he
thus
standing
and
thus
accompanied
were
to
hold
up
his
hands
clap
them
together
and
bless
god
for
the
proofs
of
prosperity
contained
in
the
new
and
red
bricks
and
were
to
cast
his
eye
southward
of
the
town
and
see
the
numerous
little
vessels
upon
the
little
arm
of
the
sea
which
comes
up
from
harwich
and
which
here
finds
its
termination
and
were
in
those
vessels
to
discover
an
additional
proof
of
prosperity
if
he
were
to
be
thus
situated
and
to
be
thus
feeling
would
not
some
doubts
be
awakened
in
his
mind
if
i
standing
behind
him
were
to
whisper
in
his
ear
do
you
not
think
that
the
greater
part
of
these
new
houses
have
been
created
by
taxes
which
went
to
pay
the
about
that
were
stationed
here
for
pretty
nearly
years
during
the
war
and
some
of
which
are
stationed
here
still
look
at
that
immense
building
my
lord
duke
it
is
fresh
and
and
fine
and
splendid
and
contains
indubitable
marks
of
opulence
but
it
is
a
barrack
aye
and
the
money
to
build
that
barrack
and
to
maintain
the
troops
has
assisted
to
beggar
to
dilapidate
to
plunge
into
ruin
and
decay
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
villages
and
hamlets
in
wiltshire
in
dorsetshire
in
somersetshire
and
in
other
counties
who
shared
not
in
the
ruthless
squanderings
of
the
war
but
leaning
my
arm
upon
the
duke
shoulder
and
giving
wilmot
a
poke
in
the
poll
to
make
him
listen
and
look
and
pointing
with
my
to
the
twelve
large
lofty
and
magnificent
churches
each
of
them
at
least
years
old
and
saying
do
you
think
ipswich
was
not
larger
and
far
more
populous
years
ago
than
it
is
at
this
hour
putting
this
question
to
him
would
it
not
check
his
exultation
and
would
it
not
make
even
wilmot
begin
to
reflect
even
at
this
hour
with
all
the
unnatural
swellings
of
the
war
there
are
not
two
thousand
people
the
and
the
to
each
of
the
magnificent
churches
of
adults
there
can
not
be
more
than
about
to
a
church
and
there
is
one
of
the
churches
which
being
well
filled
as
in
ancient
times
would
contain
from
four
to
seven
thousand
persons
for
the
nave
of
it
appears
to
me
to
be
larger
than
andrew
hall
at
norwich
which
hall
was
formerly
the
church
of
the
benedictine
priory
and
perhaps
the
great
church
here
might
have
belonged
to
some
monastery
for
here
were
three
augustine
priories
one
of
them
founded
in
the
reign
of
william
the
conqueror
another
founded
in
the
reign
of
henry
the
second
another
in
the
reign
of
king
john
with
an
augustine
friary
a
carmelite
friary
an
hospital
founded
in
the
reign
of
king
john
and
here
too
was
the
college
founded
by
cardinal
wolsey
the
gateway
of
which
though
built
in
brick
is
still
preserved
being
the
same
sort
of
architecture
as
that
of
hampton
court
and
james
palace
there
is
no
doubt
but
that
this
was
a
much
greater
place
than
it
is
now
it
is
the
great
outlet
for
the
immense
quantities
of
corn
grown
in
this
most
productive
county
and
by
farmers
the
most
clever
that
ever
lived
i
am
told
that
wheat
is
worth
six
shillings
a
quarter
more
at
some
times
at
ipswich
than
at
norwich
the
navigation
to
london
being
so
much
more
speedy
and
safe
immense
quantities
of
flour
are
sent
from
this
town
the
windmills
on
the
hills
in
the
vicinage
are
so
numerous
that
i
counted
whilst
standing
in
one
place
no
less
than
seventeen
they
are
all
painted
or
washed
white
the
sails
are
black
it
was
a
fine
morning
the
wind
was
brisk
and
their
twirling
altogether
added
greatly
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
which
having
the
broad
and
beautiful
arm
of
the
sea
on
the
one
hand
and
the
fields
and
meadows
studded
with
on
the
other
appeared
to
me
the
most
beautiful
sight
of
the
kind
that
i
had
ever
beheld
the
town
and
its
churches
were
down
in
the
dell
before
me
and
the
only
object
that
came
to
disfigure
the
scene
was
the
barrack
and
made
me
utter
involuntarily
the
words
of
blackstone
the
laws
of
england
recognise
no
distinction
between
the
citizen
and
the
soldier
they
know
of
no
standing
soldier
no
inland
fortresses
no
barracks
ah
said
i
to
myself
but
loud
enough
for
any
one
to
have
heard
me
a
hundred
yards
such
the
laws
of
england
when
mass
was
said
in
those
magnificent
churches
and
such
they
continued
until
a
parliament
came
and
deprived
the
people
of
england
of
their
rights
i
know
of
no
town
to
be
compared
with
ipswich
except
it
be
nottingham
and
there
is
this
difference
in
the
two
that
nottingham
stands
high
and
on
one
side
looks
over
a
very
fine
country
whereas
ipswich
is
in
a
dell
meadows
running
up
above
it
and
a
beautiful
arm
of
the
sea
below
it
the
town
itself
is
substantially
built
well
paved
everything
good
and
solid
and
no
wretched
dwellings
to
be
seen
on
its
outskirts
from
the
town
itself
you
can
see
nothing
but
you
can
in
no
direction
go
from
it
a
quarter
of
a
mile
without
finding
views
that
a
painter
might
crave
and
then
the
country
round
about
it
so
well
cultivated
the
land
in
such
a
beautiful
state
the
all
white
and
all
so
much
alike
the
barns
and
everything
about
the
homesteads
so
snug
the
stocks
of
turnips
so
abundant
everywhere
the
sheep
and
cattle
in
such
fine
order
the
wheat
all
drilled
the
ploughman
so
expert
the
furrows
if
a
quarter
of
a
mile
long
as
straight
as
a
line
and
laid
as
truly
as
if
with
a
level
in
short
here
is
everything
to
delight
the
eye
and
to
make
the
people
proud
of
their
country
and
this
is
the
case
throughout
the
whole
of
this
county
i
have
always
found
suffolk
farmers
great
boasters
of
their
superiority
over
others
and
i
must
say
that
it
is
not
without
reason
but
observe
this
has
been
a
very
it
has
had
poured
into
it
millions
upon
millions
of
money
drawn
from
wiltshire
and
other
inland
counties
i
should
suppose
that
wiltshire
alone
has
within
the
last
forty
years
had
two
or
three
millions
of
money
drawn
from
it
be
given
to
essex
and
at
one
time
there
were
not
less
than
sixty
thousand
men
kept
on
foot
in
these
counties
the
increase
of
london
too
the
swellings
of
the
immortal
wen
have
assisted
to
heap
wealth
upon
these
counties
but
in
spite
of
all
this
the
distress
pervades
all
ranks
and
degrees
except
those
who
live
on
the
taxes
at
eye
butter
used
to
sell
for
a
pound
it
now
sells
for
halfpenny
though
the
grass
has
not
yet
begun
to
spring
and
eggs
were
sold
at
thirty
for
a
shilling
fine
times
for
me
whose
principal
food
is
eggs
and
whose
sole
drink
is
milk
but
very
bad
times
for
those
who
sell
me
the
food
and
the
drink
coming
from
ipswich
to
bury
edmund
you
pass
through
and
stowmarket
two
very
pretty
market
towns
and
like
all
the
other
towns
in
suffolk
free
from
the
drawback
of
shabby
and
beggarly
houses
on
the
outskirts
i
remarked
that
i
did
not
see
in
the
whole
county
one
single
instance
of
paper
or
rags
supplying
the
place
of
glass
in
any
window
and
did
not
see
one
miserable
hovel
in
which
a
labourer
resided
the
county
however
is
with
the
exception
of
the
environs
of
ipswich
there
is
none
of
that
beautiful
variety
of
hill
and
dale
and
hanging
woods
that
you
see
at
every
town
in
hampshire
sussex
and
kent
it
is
curious
too
that
though
the
people
i
mean
the
poorer
classes
of
people
are
extremely
neat
in
their
houses
and
though
i
found
all
their
gardens
dug
up
and
prepared
for
cropping
you
do
not
see
about
their
cottages
and
it
is
just
the
same
in
norfolk
that
the
walks
and
the
flower
borders
and
the
and
roses
trained
over
the
doors
or
over
arched
sticks
that
you
see
in
hampshire
sussex
and
kent
that
i
have
many
a
time
sitten
upon
my
horse
to
look
at
so
long
and
so
often
as
greatly
to
retard
me
on
my
journey
nor
is
this
done
for
show
or
ostentation
if
you
find
a
cottage
in
those
counties
by
the
side
of
a
or
in
the
midst
of
a
forest
you
find
just
the
same
care
about
the
garden
and
the
flowers
in
those
counties
too
there
is
great
taste
with
regard
of
every
description
from
the
hazel
to
the
oak
in
suffolk
it
appears
to
be
just
the
contrary
here
is
the
great
dissight
of
all
these
three
eastern
counties
almost
every
bank
of
every
field
is
studded
with
that
is
to
say
trees
that
have
been
at
from
six
to
twelve
feet
from
the
ground
than
which
nothing
in
nature
can
be
more
ugly
they
send
out
shoots
from
the
head
which
are
lopped
off
once
in
ten
or
a
dozen
years
for
fuel
or
other
purposes
to
add
to
the
deformity
the
ivy
is
suffered
to
grow
on
them
which
at
the
same
time
checks
the
growth
of
the
shoots
these
pollards
become
hollow
very
soon
and
as
timber
are
fit
for
nothing
but
even
before
they
be
hollow
upon
a
farm
of
a
hundred
acres
these
pollards
by
root
and
shade
spoil
at
least
six
acres
of
the
ground
besides
being
most
destructive
to
the
fences
why
not
plant
six
acres
of
the
ground
with
timber
and
underwood
half
an
acre
a
year
would
most
amply
supply
the
farm
with
poles
and
brush
and
with
everything
wanted
in
the
way
of
fuel
and
why
not
plant
hedges
to
be
unbroken
by
these
pollards
i
have
scarcely
seen
a
single
farm
of
a
hundred
acres
without
pollards
sufficient
to
find
the
in
fuel
without
any
assistance
from
coals
for
several
years
however
the
great
number
of
in
suffolk
the
neatness
of
those
houses
the
moderation
in
point
of
extent
which
you
generally
see
and
the
great
store
of
the
food
in
the
turnips
and
the
admirable
management
of
the
whole
form
a
pretty
good
compensation
for
the
want
of
beauties
the
land
is
generally
as
clean
as
a
garden
ought
to
be
and
though
it
varies
a
good
deal
as
to
lightness
and
stiffness
they
make
it
all
bear
prodigious
quantities
of
swedish
turnips
and
on
them
pigs
sheep
and
cattle
all
equally
thrive
i
did
not
observe
a
single
poor
miserable
animal
in
the
whole
county
to
conclude
an
account
of
suffolk
and
not
to
sing
the
praises
of
bury
edmund
would
offend
every
creature
of
suffolk
birth
even
at
ipswich
when
i
was
praising
the
very
people
of
that
town
asked
me
if
i
did
not
think
bury
edmund
the
nicest
town
in
the
world
meet
them
wherever
you
will
they
have
all
the
same
boast
and
indeed
as
a
town
it
is
the
neatest
place
that
ever
was
seen
it
is
airy
it
has
several
fine
open
places
in
it
and
it
has
the
remains
of
the
famous
abbey
walls
and
the
abbey
gate
entire
and
it
is
so
clean
and
so
neat
that
nothing
can
equal
it
in
that
respect
it
was
a
favourite
spot
in
ancient
times
greatly
endowed
with
monasteries
and
hospitals
besides
the
famous
benedictine
abbey
there
were
once
a
college
and
a
friary
and
as
to
the
abbey
itself
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
and
was
so
ancient
as
to
have
been
founded
only
about
forty
years
after
the
landing
of
saint
austin
in
kent
the
land
all
round
about
it
is
good
and
the
soil
is
of
that
nature
as
not
to
produce
much
dirt
at
any
time
of
the
year
but
the
country
about
it
is
and
not
of
that
beautiful
variety
that
we
find
at
ipswich
after
all
what
is
the
reflection
now
called
for
it
is
that
this
fine
county
for
which
nature
has
done
all
that
she
can
do
soil
climate
people
everything
that
can
be
done
and
an
internal
government
civil
and
ecclesiastical
the
most
complete
in
the
world
wanting
nothing
but
to
let
to
make
every
soul
in
it
as
happy
as
people
can
be
upon
earth
the
peace
provided
for
by
the
county
rates
property
protected
by
the
law
of
the
land
the
poor
provided
for
by
the
religion
provided
for
by
the
tithes
and
the
easy
and
safe
conveyance
provided
for
by
the
extraordinary
danger
provided
against
by
the
a
complete
government
in
itself
having
to
pay
a
portion
of
sixty
millions
a
year
in
taxes
over
and
above
all
this
and
that
too
on
account
of
wars
carried
on
not
for
the
defence
of
not
for
the
upholding
of
liberty
and
but
for
the
purpose
of
crushing
liberty
and
happiness
in
other
countries
and
all
this
because
and
only
because
a
septennial
parliament
has
deprived
the
people
of
their
rights
that
which
we
most
is
not
always
that
which
would
be
one
might
imagine
that
after
all
that
i
have
said
about
this
fine
county
i
should
certainly
prefer
it
as
a
place
of
residence
i
should
not
however
my
choice
has
been
always
very
much
divided
between
the
woods
of
sussex
and
the
downs
of
wiltshire
i
should
not
like
to
be
compelled
to
decide
but
if
i
were
compelled
i
do
believe
that
i
should
fix
on
some
vale
in
wiltshire
water
meadows
at
the
bottom
going
up
towards
the
hills
those
hills
being
and
a
in
a
clump
of
trees
in
some
little
cross
vale
between
the
hills
sheltered
on
every
side
but
the
south
in
short
if
bennet
would
give
me
a
farm
the
house
of
which
lies
on
the
side
of
the
road
going
from
salisbury
to
warminster
in
the
parish
of
norton
bovant
just
before
you
enter
that
village
if
he
would
but
be
so
good
as
to
do
that
i
would
freely
give
up
all
the
rest
of
the
world
to
the
possession
of
whoever
may
get
hold
of
it
i
have
hinted
this
to
him
once
or
twice
before
but
i
am
sorry
to
say
that
he
turns
a
deaf
ear
to
my
hinting
march
i
went
from
hargham
to
lynn
on
tuesday
the
but
owing
to
the
disappointment
at
thetford
everything
was
deranged
it
was
at
lynn
but
no
preparations
of
any
sort
had
been
made
and
no
notification
given
i
therefore
resolved
after
staying
at
lynn
on
wednesday
to
make
a
short
tour
and
to
come
back
to
it
again
this
tour
was
to
take
in
cambridge
ives
stamford
peterborough
wisbeach
and
was
to
bring
me
back
to
lynn
after
a
very
busy
ten
days
i
was
particularly
desirous
to
have
a
little
political
preaching
at
ely
the
place
where
the
flogging
of
the
english
local
militia
under
a
guard
of
german
bayonets
cost
me
so
dear
i
got
there
about
noon
on
thursday
the
being
but
i
had
been
apprised
even
before
i
left
lynn
that
no
place
had
been
provided
for
my
accommodation
a
gentleman
at
lynn
gave
me
the
name
of
one
at
ely
who
as
he
thought
would
be
glad
of
an
opportunity
of
pointing
out
a
proper
place
and
of
speaking
about
it
but
just
before
i
set
off
from
lynn
i
received
a
notification
from
this
gentleman
that
he
could
do
nothing
in
the
matter
i
knew
that
ely
was
a
small
place
but
i
was
determined
to
go
and
see
the
spot
where
the
were
flogged
and
also
determined
to
find
some
opportunity
or
other
of
relating
that
story
as
publicly
as
i
could
at
ely
and
of
describing
the
of
the
story
of
which
i
will
speak
presently
arrived
at
ely
i
first
walked
round
the
beautiful
cathedral
that
honour
to
our
catholic
forefathers
and
that
standing
disgrace
to
our
protestant
selves
it
is
impossible
to
look
at
that
magnificent
pile
without
that
we
are
a
fallen
race
of
men
the
cathedral
would
leaving
out
the
palace
of
the
bishop
and
the
houses
of
the
dean
canons
and
prebendaries
weigh
more
if
it
were
put
into
a
scale
than
all
the
houses
in
the
town
and
all
the
houses
for
a
mile
round
the
neighbourhood
if
you
exclude
the
remains
of
the
ancient
monasteries
you
have
only
to
open
your
eyes
to
be
convinced
that
england
must
have
been
a
far
greater
and
more
wealthy
country
in
those
days
than
it
is
in
these
days
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
loads
of
stone
of
which
this
cathedral
and
the
monasteries
in
the
neighbourhood
were
built
must
all
have
been
brought
by
sea
from
distant
parts
of
the
kingdom
these
foundations
were
laid
more
than
a
thousand
years
ago
and
yet
there
are
vagabonds
who
have
the
impudence
to
say
that
it
is
the
protestant
religion
that
has
made
england
a
great
country
ely
is
what
one
may
call
a
miserable
little
town
very
prettily
situated
but
poor
and
mean
everything
seems
to
be
on
the
decline
as
indeed
is
the
case
everywhere
where
the
clergy
are
the
masters
they
say
that
this
bishop
has
an
income
of
a
year
he
and
the
dean
and
chapter
are
the
owners
of
all
the
land
and
tithes
for
a
great
distance
round
about
in
this
beautiful
and
most
productive
part
of
the
country
and
yet
this
famous
building
the
cathedral
is
in
a
state
of
disgraceful
irrepair
and
disfigurement
the
great
and
magnificent
windows
to
the
east
have
been
shortened
at
the
bottom
and
the
space
plastered
up
with
brick
and
mortar
in
a
very
slovenly
manner
for
the
purpose
of
saving
the
expense
of
keeping
the
glass
in
repair
great
numbers
of
the
windows
in
the
upper
part
of
the
building
have
been
partly
closed
up
in
the
same
manner
and
others
quite
closed
up
one
which
apparently
had
stood
in
need
of
repair
has
been
rebuilt
in
modern
style
because
it
was
cheaper
and
the
churchyard
contained
a
flock
of
sheep
acting
as
vergers
for
those
who
live
upon
the
immense
income
not
a
penny
of
which
ought
to
be
expended
upon
themselves
while
any
part
of
this
beautiful
building
is
in
a
state
of
irrepair
this
cathedral
was
erected
to
the
honour
of
god
and
the
holy
church
my
daughters
went
to
the
service
in
the
afternoon
in
the
choir
of
which
they
saw
god
honoured
by
the
presence
of
old
forming
the
whole
of
the
congregation
i
dare
say
that
in
catholic
times
five
thousand
people
at
a
time
have
been
assembled
in
this
church
the
cathedral
and
town
stand
upon
a
little
hill
about
three
miles
in
circumference
raised
up
as
it
were
for
the
purpose
amidst
the
rich
fen
land
by
which
the
hill
is
surrounded
and
i
dare
say
that
the
town
formerly
consisted
of
houses
built
over
a
great
part
of
this
hill
and
of
probably
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
thousand
people
the
people
do
not
now
exceed
above
four
thousand
including
the
bedridden
and
the
babies
having
no
place
provided
for
lecturing
and
knowing
no
single
soul
in
the
place
i
was
thrown
upon
my
own
resources
the
first
thing
i
did
was
to
walk
up
through
the
market
which
contained
much
more
than
an
audience
sufficient
for
me
but
leaving
the
market
people
to
carry
on
their
affairs
i
picked
up
a
sort
of
labouring
man
asked
him
if
he
recollected
when
the
local
were
flogged
under
the
guard
of
the
germans
and
receiving
an
answer
in
the
affirmative
i
asked
him
to
go
and
show
me
the
spot
which
he
did
he
showed
me
a
little
common
along
which
the
men
had
been
marched
and
into
a
piece
of
where
he
put
his
foot
upon
the
identical
spot
where
the
flogging
had
been
executed
on
that
spot
i
told
him
what
i
had
suffered
for
expressing
my
indignation
at
that
flogging
i
told
him
that
a
large
sum
of
english
money
was
now
every
year
sent
abroad
to
furnish
half
pay
and
allowances
to
the
officers
of
those
german
troops
and
to
maintain
the
widows
and
children
of
such
of
them
as
were
dead
and
i
added
you
have
to
work
to
help
to
pay
that
money
part
of
the
taxes
which
you
pay
on
your
malt
hops
beer
leather
soap
candles
tobacco
tea
sugar
and
everything
else
goes
abroad
every
year
to
pay
these
people
it
has
thus
been
going
abroad
ever
since
the
peace
and
it
will
thus
go
abroad
for
the
rest
of
your
life
if
this
system
of
managing
the
nation
affairs
continue
and
i
told
him
that
about
one
million
seven
hundred
thousand
pounds
had
been
sent
abroad
on
this
account
the
when
i
opened
i
found
that
this
man
was
willing
to
open
too
and
he
uttered
sentiments
that
would
have
convinced
me
if
i
had
not
before
been
convinced
of
the
fact
that
there
are
very
few
even
amongst
the
labourers
who
do
not
clearly
understand
the
cause
of
their
ruin
i
discovered
that
there
were
two
ely
men
flogged
upon
that
occasion
and
that
one
of
them
was
still
alive
and
residing
near
the
town
i
sent
for
this
man
who
came
to
me
in
the
evening
when
he
had
done
his
work
and
who
told
me
that
he
had
lived
seven
years
with
the
same
master
when
he
was
flogged
and
was
bailiff
or
head
man
to
his
master
he
has
now
a
wife
and
several
children
is
a
very
and
appears
to
be
a
man
and
to
bear
an
excellent
character
but
how
was
i
to
harangue
for
i
was
determined
not
to
quit
ely
without
something
of
that
sort
i
told
this
labouring
man
who
showed
me
the
flogging
spot
my
name
which
seemed
to
surprise
him
very
much
for
he
had
heard
of
me
before
after
i
had
returned
to
my
inn
i
walked
back
again
through
the
market
amongst
the
farmers
then
went
to
an
inn
that
looked
out
upon
the
went
into
an
room
threw
up
the
sash
and
sat
down
at
the
window
and
looked
out
upon
the
market
little
groups
soon
collected
to
survey
me
while
i
sat
in
a
very
unconcerned
attitude
the
farmers
had
dined
or
i
should
have
found
out
the
most
numerous
assemblage
and
have
dined
with
them
the
next
best
thing
was
to
go
and
sit
down
in
the
room
where
they
usually
dropped
in
to
drink
after
dinner
and
as
they
nearly
all
smoke
to
take
a
pipe
with
them
this
therefore
i
did
and
after
a
time
we
began
to
talk
the
room
was
too
small
to
contain
a
twentieth
part
of
the
people
that
would
have
come
in
if
they
could
it
was
hot
to
suffocation
but
nevertheless
i
related
to
them
the
account
of
the
flogging
and
of
my
persecution
on
that
account
and
i
related
to
them
the
account
above
stated
with
regard
to
the
english
money
now
sent
to
the
germans
at
which
they
appeared
to
be
utterly
astonished
i
had
not
time
sufficient
for
a
lecture
but
i
explained
to
them
briefly
the
real
cause
of
the
distress
which
prevailed
i
warned
the
farmers
particularly
against
the
consequences
of
hoping
that
this
distress
would
remove
itself
i
portrayed
to
them
the
effects
of
the
taxes
and
showed
them
that
we
owe
this
enormous
burden
to
the
want
of
being
fairly
represented
in
the
parliament
above
all
things
i
did
that
which
i
never
fail
to
do
showed
them
the
absurdity
of
grumbling
at
the
six
millions
a
year
given
in
relief
to
the
poor
while
they
were
silent
and
seemed
to
think
nothing
of
the
sixty
millions
of
taxes
collected
by
the
government
at
london
and
i
asked
them
how
any
man
of
property
could
have
the
impudence
to
call
upon
the
labouring
man
to
serve
in
the
militia
and
to
deny
that
that
labouring
man
had
in
case
of
need
a
clear
right
to
a
share
of
the
produce
of
the
land
i
explained
to
them
how
the
poor
were
originally
relieved
told
them
that
the
revenues
of
the
livings
which
had
their
foundation
in
were
divided
amongst
the
poor
the
demands
for
repair
of
the
churches
and
the
clergy
themselves
i
explained
to
them
how
and
came
to
be
introduced
how
the
burden
of
maintaining
the
poor
came
to
be
thrown
upon
the
people
at
large
how
the
nation
had
sunk
by
degrees
ever
since
the
event
called
the
reformation
and
pointing
towards
the
cathedral
i
said
can
you
believe
gentlemen
that
when
that
magnificent
pile
was
reared
and
when
all
the
fine
monasteries
hospitals
schools
and
other
resorts
of
piety
and
charity
existed
in
this
town
and
neighbourhood
can
you
believe
that
ely
was
the
miserable
little
place
that
it
now
is
and
that
that
england
which
had
never
heard
of
the
name
of
contained
the
crowds
of
miserable
creatures
that
it
now
contains
some
starving
at
by
the
and
others
drawing
loaded
wagons
on
that
way
a
young
man
in
the
room
i
having
come
to
a
pause
said
but
sir
were
there
no
poor
in
catholic
times
yes
said
i
to
be
sure
there
were
the
scripture
says
that
the
poor
shall
never
cease
out
of
the
land
and
there
are
five
hundred
texts
of
scripture
enjoining
on
all
men
to
be
good
and
kind
to
the
poor
it
is
necessary
to
the
existence
of
civil
society
that
there
should
be
poor
men
have
two
motives
to
industry
and
care
in
all
the
walks
of
life
one
to
acquire
wealth
but
the
other
and
stronger
to
avoid
poverty
if
there
were
no
poverty
there
would
be
no
industry
no
enterprise
but
this
poverty
is
not
to
be
made
a
punishment
unjustly
severe
idleness
extravagance
are
offences
against
morality
but
they
are
not
offences
of
that
heinous
nature
to
justify
the
infliction
of
starvation
by
way
of
punishment
it
is
therefore
the
duty
of
every
man
that
is
able
it
is
particularly
the
duty
of
every
government
and
it
was
a
duty
faithfully
executed
by
the
catholic
church
to
take
care
that
no
human
being
should
perish
for
want
in
a
land
of
plenty
and
to
take
care
too
that
no
one
should
be
deficient
of
a
sufficiency
of
food
and
raiment
not
only
to
sustain
life
but
also
to
sustain
health
the
young
man
said
i
thank
you
sir
i
am
answered
i
strongly
advised
the
farmers
to
be
well
with
their
for
that
unless
their
flocks
were
as
safe
in
their
fields
as
their
bodies
were
in
their
beds
their
lives
must
be
lives
of
misery
that
if
their
sacks
and
barns
were
not
places
of
as
safe
deposit
for
their
corn
as
their
drawers
were
for
their
money
the
life
of
the
farmer
was
the
most
wretched
upon
earth
in
place
of
being
the
most
pleasant
as
it
ought
to
be
friday
april
quitting
cambridge
and
chafy
and
serjeant
frere
on
monday
the
of
march
i
arrived
at
ives
in
huntingdonshire
about
one
in
the
day
in
the
evening
i
harangued
to
about
persons
principally
farmers
in
a
wheelwright
shop
that
being
the
only
place
in
the
town
of
sufficient
dimensions
and
sufficiently
strong
it
was
and
this
is
a
great
as
i
was
not
to
be
at
stamford
in
lincolnshire
till
the
i
went
from
ives
to
my
friend
wells
near
huntingdon
and
remained
there
till
the
in
the
morning
employing
the
evening
of
the
in
going
to
chatteris
in
the
isle
of
ely
and
there
addressing
a
good
large
company
of
farmers
on
the
i
went
to
stamford
and
in
the
evening
spoke
to
about
farmers
and
others
in
a
large
room
in
a
very
fine
and
excellent
inn
called
standwell
hotel
which
is
with
few
exceptions
the
nicest
inn
that
i
have
ever
been
in
on
the
of
april
i
harangued
here
again
and
had
amongst
my
auditors
some
most
agreeable
intelligent
and
yeomen
from
the
little
county
of
rutland
who
made
respecting
the
in
the
proposition
the
details
of
the
purport
of
which
i
communicated
to
my
readers
in
the
last
register
on
the
of
april
i
met
my
audience
in
the
playhouse
at
peterborough
and
though
it
had
snowed
all
day
and
was
very
wet
and
sloppy
i
had
a
good
large
audience
and
i
did
not
let
this
opportunity
pass
without
telling
my
hearers
of
the
part
that
their
neighbour
lord
fitzwilliam
had
acted
with
regard
to
the
with
regard
to
and
his
with
regard
to
the
which
drove
me
across
the
atlantic
in
and
with
regard
to
the
putting
into
the
present
parliament
aye
and
for
that
very
town
that
very
lawyer
scarlett
whose
state
prosecutions
are
now
become
so
famous
never
said
i
did
i
say
that
behind
a
man
back
that
i
would
not
say
to
his
face
i
wish
i
had
his
face
before
me
but
i
am
here
as
near
to
it
as
i
can
get
i
am
before
the
face
of
his
friends
here
therefore
i
will
say
what
i
think
of
him
when
i
had
described
his
conduct
and
given
my
opinion
on
it
many
applauded
and
not
one
expressed
disapprobation
on
the
i
speechified
at
wisbeach
in
the
playhouse
to
about
people
i
think
it
was
and
that
same
night
went
to
sleep
at
a
a
total
stranger
to
me
however
at
edmund
in
the
heart
of
the
fens
i
stayed
there
on
the
sunday
the
morning
of
which
brought
a
hard
frost
ice
an
inch
thick
and
the
total
destruction
of
the
apricot
blossoms
after
passing
sunday
and
the
greater
part
of
monday
the
at
edmund
where
my
daughters
and
myself
received
the
greatest
kindness
and
attention
we
went
on
monday
afternoon
to
crowland
where
we
were
most
kindly
lodged
and
entertained
at
the
houses
of
two
gentlemen
to
whom
also
we
were
personally
perfect
strangers
and
in
the
evening
i
addressed
a
very
large
assemblage
of
most
respectable
farmers
and
others
in
this
once
famous
town
there
was
another
hard
frost
on
the
monday
morning
just
as
it
were
to
the
apricot
bloom
on
the
i
went
to
lynn
and
on
that
evening
and
on
the
evening
of
the
i
spoke
to
about
people
in
the
playhouse
and
here
there
was
more
than
i
have
ever
met
with
at
any
other
place
this
town
though
containing
as
good
and
kind
friends
as
i
have
met
with
in
any
other
and
though
the
people
are
generally
as
good
contains
also
apparently
a
large
proportion
of
the
offspring
most
likely
of
the
of
the
two
or
three
or
even
man
may
if
not
tossed
out
at
once
disturb
and
interrupt
everything
in
a
case
where
constant
attention
to
and
is
requisite
to
insure
utility
to
the
meeting
there
were
but
here
and
though
they
were
finally
silenced
it
was
not
without
great
loss
of
time
great
noise
and
hubbub
two
i
was
told
were
men
and
one
a
sort
of
on
the
i
went
to
holbeach
in
this
noble
county
of
lincoln
and
gracious
god
what
a
with
the
scene
at
lynn
i
knew
not
a
soul
in
the
place
fields
a
bookseller
and
printer
had
invited
me
by
letter
and
had
in
the
nicest
and
most
unostentatious
manner
made
all
the
preparations
holbeach
lies
in
the
midst
of
some
of
the
richest
land
in
the
world
a
small
but
a
parish
more
than
twenty
miles
across
larger
i
believe
than
the
county
of
rutland
produced
an
audience
in
a
very
nice
room
with
seats
prepared
of
apparently
all
wealthy
farmers
and
men
in
that
rank
of
life
and
an
audience
so
attentive
to
the
dry
matters
on
which
i
had
to
address
it
i
have
very
seldom
met
with
i
was
delighted
with
holbeach
a
neat
little
town
a
most
beautiful
church
with
a
spire
like
that
of
the
man
of
ross
pointing
to
the
skies
gardens
very
pretty
in
abundance
with
ready
to
burst
and
land
dark
in
colour
and
as
fine
in
substance
as
flour
as
fine
as
if
sifted
through
one
of
the
sieves
with
which
we
get
the
dust
out
of
the
clover
seed
and
when
cut
deep
down
into
with
a
spade
precisely
as
to
substance
like
a
piece
of
hard
butter
yet
nowhere
is
the
greater
than
here
i
walked
on
from
holbeach
six
miles
towards
boston
and
seeing
the
fatness
of
the
land
and
the
fine
grass
and
the
sheep
lying
about
like
stretched
in
the
sun
and
seeing
the
abject
state
of
the
labouring
people
i
could
not
help
exclaiming
god
has
given
us
the
best
country
in
the
world
our
brave
and
wise
and
virtuous
fathers
who
built
all
these
magnificent
churches
gave
us
the
best
government
in
the
world
and
we
their
cowardly
and
foolish
and
profligate
sons
have
made
this
what
we
now
behold
i
arrived
at
boston
where
i
am
now
writing
friday
april
about
ten
i
must
arrive
at
louth
before
i
can
say
what
my
future
route
will
be
there
is
an
immense
fair
at
lincoln
next
week
and
a
friend
has
been
to
point
out
the
proper
days
to
be
there
as
however
this
register
will
not
come
from
the
press
until
after
i
shall
have
had
an
opportunity
of
writing
something
at
louth
time
enough
to
be
inserted
in
it
i
will
here
go
back
and
speak
of
the
country
that
i
have
travelled
over
since
i
left
cambridge
on
the
of
march
from
cambridge
to
ives
the
land
is
generally
in
open
unfenced
fields
and
some
common
fields
generally
stiff
land
and
some
of
it
not
very
good
and
wheat
in
many
places
looking
rather
thin
from
ives
to
chatteris
which
last
is
in
the
isle
of
ely
the
land
is
better
particularly
as
you
approach
the
latter
place
from
chatteris
i
came
back
to
huntingdon
and
once
more
saw
its
beautiful
meadows
of
which
i
spoke
when
i
went
thither
in
from
huntingdon
through
stilton
to
stamford
the
two
last
in
lincolnshire
is
a
country
of
rich
arable
land
and
grass
fields
and
of
beautiful
meadows
the
enclosures
are
very
large
the
soil
red
with
a
whitish
stone
below
very
much
like
the
soil
at
and
near
ross
in
herefordshire
and
like
that
near
coventry
and
warwick
here
as
all
over
this
country
everlasting
fine
sheep
the
houses
all
along
here
are
built
of
the
stone
of
the
country
you
seldom
see
brick
the
churches
are
large
lofty
and
fine
and
give
proof
that
the
country
was
formerly
much
more
populous
than
it
is
now
and
that
the
people
had
a
vast
deal
more
of
wealth
in
their
hands
and
at
their
own
disposal
there
are
three
beautiful
churches
at
stamford
not
less
i
dare
say
than
three
hundred
years
old
but
two
of
them
i
did
not
go
to
the
other
are
as
perfect
as
when
just
finished
except
as
to
the
most
of
which
have
been
destroyed
by
the
ungrateful
protestant
barbarians
of
different
sorts
but
some
of
which
of
the
of
their
ruthless
hands
are
still
in
the
niches
from
stamford
to
peterborough
is
a
country
of
the
same
description
with
the
additional
beauty
of
here
and
there
and
with
meadows
just
like
those
at
huntingdon
and
not
surpassed
by
those
on
the
severn
near
worcester
nor
by
those
on
the
avon
at
tewkesbury
the
cathedral
at
peterborough
is
exquisitely
beautiful
and
i
have
great
pleasure
in
saying
that
contrary
to
the
pile
at
ely
it
is
kept
in
good
order
the
bishop
herbert
marsh
residing
a
good
deal
on
the
spot
and
though
he
write
a
pamphlet
to
justify
and
urge
on
the
war
the
ruinous
war
and
though
he
get
a
for
it
he
is
they
told
me
very
good
to
the
poor
people
my
daughters
had
a
great
desire
to
see
and
i
had
a
great
desire
they
should
see
the
of
that
that
woman
and
that
honour
to
catherine
queen
of
the
ferocious
tyrant
henry
the
eighth
to
the
infamy
of
that
ruffian
and
the
shame
of
after
ages
there
is
no
to
record
her
virtues
and
her
sufferings
and
the
remains
of
this
daughter
of
the
wise
ferdinand
and
of
the
generous
isabella
who
sold
her
jewels
to
enable
columbus
to
discover
the
new
world
lie
under
the
floor
of
the
cathedral
commemorated
by
a
short
inscription
on
a
plate
of
brass
all
men
protestants
or
not
protestants
feel
as
i
feel
upon
this
subject
search
the
of
the
bishop
and
of
his
dean
and
chapter
and
these
feelings
are
there
but
to
do
to
the
memory
of
this
illustrious
victim
of
tyranny
would
be
to
cast
a
reflection
on
that
event
to
which
they
owe
their
rich
possessions
and
at
the
same
time
to
suggest
ideas
not
very
favourable
to
the
descendants
of
those
who
divided
amongst
them
the
plunder
of
the
people
arising
out
of
that
event
and
which
descendants
are
their
patrons
and
give
them
what
they
possess
from
this
cause
and
no
other
it
is
that
the
memory
of
the
virtuous
catherine
is
unblazoned
while
that
of
the
tyrannical
the
cruel
and
the
immoral
elizabeth
is
recorded
with
all
possible
veneration
and
all
possible
of
her
disgusting
amours
and
endless
crimes
they
relate
at
peterborough
that
the
same
sexton
who
buried
queen
catherine
also
buried
here
mary
queen
of
scots
the
remains
of
the
latter
of
very
questionable
virtue
or
rather
of
unquestionable
vice
were
removed
to
westminster
abbey
by
her
son
james
the
first
but
those
of
the
virtuous
queen
were
suffered
to
remain
unhonoured
good
god
what
injustice
what
a
want
of
principle
what
hostility
to
all
virtuous
feeling
has
not
been
the
fruit
of
this
protestant
reformation
what
plunder
what
disgrace
to
england
what
shame
what
misery
has
that
event
not
produced
there
is
nothing
that
i
address
to
my
hearers
with
more
visible
effect
than
a
statement
of
manner
in
which
the
and
the
this
of
course
includes
an
account
of
the
poor
were
relieved
in
catholic
to
the
far
greater
part
of
people
this
is
information
they
are
in
it
and
the
impression
is
very
great
always
before
we
part
tom
cranmer
church
receives
a
considerable
blow
there
is
in
the
cathedral
a
very
ancient
monument
made
to
commemorate
they
say
the
murder
of
the
abbot
and
his
monks
by
the
danes
its
date
is
the
year
almost
all
the
cathedrals
were
it
appears
originally
churches
of
monasteries
that
of
winchester
and
several
others
certainly
were
there
has
lately
died
in
the
garden
of
the
palace
a
tortoise
that
had
been
more
they
say
than
two
hundred
years
a
fact
very
likely
to
be
known
because
at
the
end
of
thirty
or
forty
people
would
begin
to
talk
about
it
as
something
remarkable
and
thus
the
record
would
be
handed
down
from
father
to
son
from
peterborough
to
wisbeach
the
road
for
the
most
part
lies
through
the
and
here
we
passed
through
the
village
of
thorney
where
there
was
a
famous
abbey
which
together
with
its
valuable
domain
was
given
by
the
savage
tyrant
henry
to
john
lord
russell
made
a
lord
by
that
tyrant
the
founder
of
the
family
of
that
name
this
man
got
also
the
abbey
and
estate
at
woburn
the
priory
and
its
estate
at
tavistock
and
in
the
next
reign
he
got
covent
garden
and
other
parts
adjoining
together
with
other
things
all
then
a
history
a
of
this
family
which
i
hope
i
shall
find
time
to
write
would
be
a
most
valuable
thing
it
would
be
a
nice
little
specimen
of
the
way
in
which
these
families
became
possessed
of
a
great
part
of
their
estates
it
would
show
how
the
and
the
came
it
would
set
the
whole
nation
at
once
some
years
ago
i
had
a
set
of
the
scotch
which
contained
an
account
of
every
other
in
the
kingdom
but
i
could
find
in
it
no
account
of
family
either
under
the
word
russell
or
the
word
bedford
i
got
into
a
passion
with
the
book
because
it
contained
no
account
of
the
mode
of
raising
the
and
it
was
sold
to
as
i
was
told
of
alderman
heygate
and
if
that
gentleman
look
into
the
book
he
will
find
what
i
say
to
be
true
but
if
i
should
be
in
error
about
this
perhaps
he
will
have
the
goodness
to
let
me
know
it
i
shall
be
obliged
to
any
one
to
point
me
out
any
printed
account
of
this
family
and
particularly
to
tell
me
where
i
can
get
an
old
folio
containing
amongst
other
things
bulstrode
argument
and
narrative
in
justification
of
the
sentence
and
execution
of
lord
william
russell
in
the
reign
of
charles
the
second
it
is
impossible
to
look
at
the
village
of
thorney
and
to
think
of
its
abbey
it
is
impossible
to
look
at
the
thousand
of
land
around
covered
with
fat
sheep
or
bearing
six
quarters
of
wheat
or
ten
of
oats
to
the
acre
without
any
manure
it
is
impossible
to
think
of
these
without
feeling
a
desire
that
the
whole
nation
should
know
all
about
the
of
the
possessors
wisbeach
lying
farther
up
the
arm
of
the
sea
than
lynn
is
like
the
latter
a
little
town
of
commerce
chiefly
engaged
in
exporting
to
the
south
that
grows
in
this
productive
country
it
is
a
good
solid
town
though
not
handsome
and
has
a
large
market
particularly
for
corn
to
crowland
i
went
as
before
stated
from
wisbeach
staying
two
nights
at
edmund
here
i
was
in
the
heart
of
the
fens
the
whole
country
as
as
the
table
on
which
i
am
now
writing
the
horizon
like
the
sea
in
a
dead
calm
you
see
the
morning
sun
come
up
just
as
at
sea
and
see
it
go
down
over
the
rim
in
just
the
same
way
as
at
sea
in
a
calm
the
land
covered
with
beautiful
grass
with
sheep
lying
about
upon
it
as
fat
as
hogs
stretched
out
sleeping
in
a
stye
the
kind
and
polite
friends
with
whom
we
were
lodged
had
a
very
neat
garden
and
fine
young
orchard
everything
grows
well
here
earth
without
a
stone
so
big
as
a
pin
head
grass
as
thick
as
it
can
grow
on
the
ground
immense
separated
by
ditches
and
not
the
sign
of
dock
or
thistle
or
other
weed
to
be
seen
what
a
contrast
between
these
and
the
of
surrey
amongst
which
i
was
born
yet
the
labourers
who
spuddle
about
the
ground
in
the
little
between
those
are
better
off
than
those
that
exist
in
this
fat
of
the
land
the
grasping
system
takes
away
because
it
has
the
means
of
coming
at
the
value
of
all
the
poor
man
enjoys
because
he
is
thought
too
poor
to
have
anything
he
is
there
allowed
to
have
what
is
deemed
but
here
where
every
inch
is
valuable
not
one
inch
is
he
permitted
to
enjoy
at
crowland
also
still
in
the
fens
was
a
great
and
rich
a
good
part
of
the
magnificent
ruins
of
the
church
of
which
are
still
standing
one
corner
or
part
of
it
being
used
as
the
by
the
worms
which
have
crept
out
of
the
dead
bodies
of
those
who
lived
in
the
days
of
the
founders
and
man
could
want
the
larger
pile
exult
and
claim
the
corner
with
a
smile
they
tell
you
that
all
the
country
at
and
near
crowland
was
a
mere
swamp
a
mere
bog
bearing
nothing
worth
naming
until
the
took
place
the
thing
called
the
reformation
has
lied
common
sense
out
of
men
minds
so
a
thing
to
choose
a
barren
swamp
whereon
or
wherein
to
make
the
site
of
an
abbey
and
of
a
benedictine
abbey
too
it
has
been
always
observed
that
the
monks
took
care
to
choose
for
their
places
of
abode
pleasant
spots
surrounded
by
productive
land
the
likeliest
thing
in
the
world
for
these
monks
to
choose
a
swamp
for
their
surrounded
by
land
that
produced
nothing
good
the
thing
gives
the
lie
to
itself
and
it
is
impossible
to
reject
the
belief
that
these
fens
were
as
productive
of
corn
and
meat
a
thousand
years
ago
and
more
so
than
they
are
at
this
hour
there
is
a
curious
triangular
bridge
here
on
one
part
of
which
stands
the
statue
of
one
of
the
ancient
kings
it
is
all
of
great
age
and
everything
shows
that
crowland
was
a
place
of
importance
in
the
earliest
times
from
crowland
to
lynn
through
thorney
and
wisbeach
is
all
fens
well
besprinkled
formerly
with
monasteries
of
various
descriptions
and
still
well
set
with
magnificent
churches
from
lynn
to
holbeach
you
get
out
of
the
real
fens
and
into
the
land
that
i
attempted
to
describe
when
a
few
pages
back
i
was
speaking
of
holbeach
i
say
attempted
for
i
defy
tongue
or
pen
to
make
the
description
adequate
to
the
matter
to
know
what
the
thing
is
you
must
it
the
same
land
continues
all
the
way
on
to
boston
endless
grass
and
endless
fat
sheep
not
a
stone
not
a
weed
sunday
april
last
night
i
made
a
speech
at
the
playhouse
to
an
audience
whose
appearance
was
sufficient
to
fill
me
with
pride
i
had
given
notice
that
i
should
perform
overlooking
the
circumstance
that
it
was
good
friday
in
apologising
for
this
inadvertence
i
took
occasion
to
observe
that
even
if
i
had
persevered
the
clergy
of
the
church
could
have
nothing
to
object
seeing
that
they
were
now
silent
while
a
bill
was
passing
in
parliament
to
put
on
a
level
with
to
enable
jews
the
blasphemers
of
the
redeemer
to
sit
on
the
bench
to
sit
in
both
houses
of
parliament
to
sit
in
council
with
the
king
and
to
be
kings
of
england
if
entitled
to
the
crown
which
by
possibility
they
might
become
if
this
bill
were
to
pass
that
to
this
bill
clergy
had
offered
no
and
that
therefore
how
could
they
hold
sacred
the
anniversary
appointed
to
commemorate
the
crucifixion
of
christ
by
the
hands
of
the
blaspheming
and
bloody
jews
that
at
any
rate
if
this
bill
passed
if
those
who
called
jesus
christ
an
were
thus
declared
to
be
as
those
who
adored
him
there
was
not
i
hoped
a
man
in
the
kingdom
who
would
pretend
that
it
would
be
just
to
compel
the
people
to
pay
tithes
and
fees
and
offerings
to
men
for
this
was
a
and
as
such
it
was
received
this
morning
i
went
out
at
six
looked
at
the
town
walked
three
miles
on
the
road
to
spilsby
and
back
to
breakfast
at
nine
boston
is
latin
for
though
not
above
a
fourth
or
fifth
part
of
the
size
of
its
in
new
england
which
got
its
name
i
dare
say
from
some
persecuted
native
of
this
place
who
had
quitted
england
and
all
her
wealth
and
all
her
glories
to
preserve
that
which
was
still
more
dear
to
him
though
not
a
town
like
new
boston
and
though
little
to
what
it
formerly
was
when
agricultural
produce
was
the
great
staple
of
the
kingdom
and
the
great
subject
of
foreign
exchange
is
nevertheless
a
very
fine
town
good
houses
good
shops
pretty
gardens
about
it
a
fine
open
place
nearly
equal
to
that
of
nottingham
in
the
middle
of
it
a
river
and
a
canal
passing
through
it
each
crossed
by
a
handsome
and
substantial
bridge
a
fine
market
for
sheep
cattle
and
pigs
and
another
for
meat
butter
and
fish
and
being
like
lynn
a
great
place
for
the
export
of
corn
and
flour
and
having
many
fine
mills
it
is
altogether
a
town
of
very
considerable
importance
and
which
is
not
to
be
overlooked
inhabited
by
people
none
of
whom
appear
to
be
in
misery
the
great
pride
and
glory
of
the
bostonians
is
which
is
i
think
feet
long
feet
wide
and
has
a
tower
or
steeple
as
they
call
it
feet
high
which
is
both
a
and
a
to
describe
the
richness
the
magnificence
the
symmetry
the
exquisite
beauty
of
this
pile
is
wholly
out
of
my
power
it
is
impossible
to
look
at
it
without
feeling
first
admiration
and
reverence
and
gratitude
to
the
memory
of
our
fathers
who
reared
it
and
next
indignation
at
those
who
affect
to
believe
and
contempt
for
those
who
do
believe
that
when
this
pile
was
reared
the
age
was
the
people
rude
and
ignorant
and
the
country
of
and
look
at
this
church
then
look
at
the
heaps
of
white
rubbish
that
the
parsons
have
lately
stuck
up
under
the
and
which
after
having
been
built
with
money
forced
from
the
nation
by
odious
taxes
they
have
stuffed
full
of
called
which
they
let
for
money
as
and
and
are
let
at
fairs
and
markets
nay
after
having
looked
at
this
work
of
the
ages
look
at
that
great
heavy
ugly
unmeaning
mass
of
stone
called
paul
which
an
american
friend
of
mine
who
came
to
london
from
falmouth
and
had
seen
the
cathedrals
at
exeter
and
salisbury
swore
to
me
that
when
he
first
saw
it
he
was
at
a
loss
to
guess
whether
it
were
a
or
a
after
looking
at
boston
church
go
and
look
at
that
great
gloomy
lump
created
by
a
protestant
parliament
and
by
taxes
wrung
by
force
from
the
whole
nation
and
then
say
which
is
the
age
really
meriting
the
epithet
botolph
to
whom
this
church
is
dedicated
while
he
if
saints
see
and
hear
what
is
passing
on
earth
must
lament
that
the
mass
has
been
in
this
noble
edifice
supplanted
by
the
monotonous
hummings
of
an
oaken
hutch
has
not
the
mortification
to
see
his
church
treated
in
a
manner
as
if
the
new
possessors
sighed
for
the
hour
of
its
destruction
it
is
taken
great
care
of
and
though
it
has
cruelly
suffered
from
though
the
images
are
gone
and
the
stained
glass
and
though
the
glazing
is
now
in
squares
instead
of
lozenges
though
the
nave
is
stuffed
with
called
pews
and
though
other
changes
have
taken
place
detracting
from
the
beauty
of
the
edifice
great
care
is
taken
of
it
as
it
now
is
and
the
inside
is
not
disfigured
and
disgraced
by
a
that
great
and
characteristic
mark
of
protestant
taste
which
as
nearly
as
may
be
makes
a
church
like
a
playhouse
saint
botolph
on
the
supposition
before
mentioned
has
the
satisfaction
to
see
that
the
base
of
his
celebrated
church
is
surrounded
by
an
iron
fence
to
keep
from
it
all
offensive
and
corroding
matter
which
is
so
disgusting
to
the
sight
round
the
magnificent
piles
at
norwich
ely
and
other
places
that
the
churchyard
and
all
appertaining
to
it
are
kept
in
the
neatest
and
most
respectable
state
that
no
money
has
been
spared
for
these
purposes
that
here
the
eye
tells
the
heart
that
gratitude
towards
the
fathers
of
the
bostonians
is
not
extinguished
in
the
breasts
of
their
sons
and
this
the
saint
will
know
that
he
owes
to
the
circumstances
that
the
parish
is
a
poor
vicarage
and
that
the
care
of
his
church
is
in
the
hands
of
industrious
and
not
in
those
of
a
fat
and
luxurious
dean
and
chapter
wallowing
in
wealth
derived
from
the
people
labour
a
fine
soft
showery
morning
saw
us
out
of
boston
carrying
with
us
the
most
pleasing
reflections
as
to
our
reception
and
treatment
there
by
numerous
persons
none
of
whom
we
had
ever
seen
before
the
face
of
the
country
for
about
half
the
way
the
soil
the
grass
the
endless
sheep
the
and
magnificent
churches
continue
as
on
the
other
side
of
boston
but
after
that
we
got
out
of
the
low
and
level
land
at
sibsey
a
pretty
village
five
miles
from
boston
we
saw
for
the
first
time
since
we
left
peterborough
land
rising
above
the
level
of
the
horizon
and
not
having
seen
such
a
thing
for
so
long
it
had
struck
my
daughters
who
overtook
me
on
the
road
i
having
walked
on
from
boston
that
the
sight
had
an
effect
like
that
produced
by
the
first
of
after
a
voyage
across
the
atlantic
we
now
soon
got
into
a
country
of
hedges
and
dry
land
and
gravel
and
clay
and
stones
the
land
not
bad
however
pretty
much
like
that
of
sussex
lying
between
the
forest
part
and
the
south
downs
a
good
proportion
of
woodland
also
and
just
before
we
got
to
horncastle
we
passed
the
park
of
that
dymock
who
is
called
the
champion
of
england
and
to
whom
it
is
said
hereabouts
that
we
pay
out
of
the
taxes
eight
thousand
pounds
a
year
this
never
can
be
to
be
sure
but
if
we
pay
him
only
a
hundred
a
year
i
will
lay
down
my
against
that
of
the
champion
that
we
do
not
pay
him
even
for
five
years
longer
it
is
curious
that
the
moment
you
get
out
of
the
the
churches
become
and
with
scarcely
anything
in
the
way
of
or
this
town
is
seated
in
the
middle
of
a
large
valley
not
however
remarkable
for
anything
of
peculiar
value
or
beauty
a
purely
agricultural
town
well
built
and
not
mean
in
any
part
of
it
it
is
a
great
rendezvous
for
horses
and
cattle
and
and
for
those
who
sell
these
and
accordingly
it
suffers
severely
from
the
loss
of
the
small
april
i
made
a
speech
last
evening
to
from
to
almost
all
farmers
and
most
men
of
apparent
wealth
to
a
certain
extent
i
have
seldom
been
better
pleased
with
my
audience
it
is
not
the
clapping
and
huzzaing
that
i
value
so
much
as
the
the
at
me
from
at
once
and
then
when
the
point
is
concluded
the
and
nod
at
each
as
if
the
parties
were
saying
of
that
and
of
these
i
had
a
great
deal
at
horncastle
they
say
that
there
are
hundred
parish
churches
within
six
miles
of
this
i
dare
say
that
there
was
one
farmer
from
almost
every
one
of
those
parishes
this
is
sowing
the
seeds
of
truth
in
a
very
sure
manner
it
is
not
scattering
broadcast
it
is
really
the
there
is
one
deficiency
and
that
with
me
a
great
one
throughout
this
country
of
corn
and
grass
and
oxen
and
sheep
that
i
have
come
over
during
the
last
three
weeks
namely
the
want
of
we
are
now
just
in
that
season
when
they
sing
most
here
in
all
this
country
i
have
seen
and
heard
only
about
four
and
not
one
other
singing
bird
of
any
description
and
of
the
small
birds
that
do
not
sing
i
have
seen
only
one
and
it
was
perched
on
the
rail
of
a
pound
between
boston
and
sibsey
oh
the
thousands
of
linnets
all
singing
together
on
one
tree
in
the
of
surrey
oh
the
carolling
in
the
coppices
and
the
dingles
of
hampshire
and
sussex
and
kent
at
this
moment
in
the
morning
the
groves
at
barn
elm
are
echoing
with
the
warblings
of
thousands
upon
thousands
of
birds
the
begins
a
little
before
it
is
light
next
the
next
the
begin
to
rise
all
the
rest
begin
the
moment
the
sun
gives
the
signal
and
from
the
hedges
the
bushes
from
the
middle
and
the
topmost
twigs
of
the
trees
comes
the
singing
of
endless
variety
from
the
long
dead
grass
comes
the
sound
of
the
sweet
and
soft
voice
of
the
or
while
the
loud
and
merry
song
of
the
the
songster
himself
out
of
sight
seems
to
descend
from
the
skies
milton
in
his
description
of
paradise
has
not
omitted
the
song
of
earliest
birds
however
everything
taken
together
here
in
lincolnshire
are
more
good
things
than
man
could
have
had
the
conscience
to
of
god
and
now
if
i
had
time
and
room
to
describe
the
state
of
in
the
country
through
which
i
have
passed
i
should
show
that
the
people
at
westminster
would
have
known
how
to
turn
paradise
itself
into
hell
i
must
however
defer
this
until
my
next
when
i
shall
have
been
at
hull
and
lincoln
and
have
had
a
view
of
the
whole
of
this
rich
and
fine
country
in
the
meanwhile
however
i
can
not
help
congratulating
that
fellow
wilmot
horton
and
his
burdett
that
emigration
is
going
on
at
a
swimming
rate
thousands
are
going
and
that
too
mortgaging
the
but
fellows
it
is
not
the
the
the
it
is
not
the
that
are
going
but
men
with
from
to
in
their
pocket
this
very
year
from
two
to
five
millions
of
pounds
sterling
will
actually
be
carried
to
the
united
states
the
scotch
who
have
money
to
pay
their
passages
go
to
new
york
those
who
have
none
get
carried
to
canada
that
they
may
thence
get
into
the
united
states
i
will
inquire
one
of
these
days
what
burdett
has
to
live
in
england
more
than
those
whom
he
proposes
to
send
away
near
lincoln
april
here
we
are
at
the
end
of
a
pretty
decent
trip
since
we
left
boston
the
next
place
on
our
way
to
hull
was
horncastle
where
i
preached
politics
in
the
playhouse
to
a
most
respectable
body
of
farmers
who
had
come
in
the
wet
to
meet
me
john
peniston
who
had
invited
me
to
stop
there
behaved
in
a
very
obliging
manner
and
made
all
things
very
pleasant
the
country
boston
continued
as
i
said
before
flat
for
about
half
the
way
to
horncastle
and
we
then
began
to
see
the
high
land
from
horncastle
i
set
off
two
hours
before
the
carriage
and
going
through
a
very
pretty
village
called
ashby
got
to
another
at
the
foot
of
a
hill
which
they
say
forms
part
of
the
that
is
a
ridge
of
hills
this
second
village
is
called
scamblesby
the
vale
in
which
it
lies
is
very
fine
land
a
hazel
mould
rich
and
light
too
i
saw
a
man
here
ploughing
for
barley
after
turnips
with
the
horse
did
not
seem
to
work
hard
and
the
man
was
i
need
not
say
that
he
was
young
and
i
dare
say
he
had
the
good
sense
to
keep
his
legs
under
another
man
table
and
to
stretch
his
body
on
another
man
bed
this
is
a
very
fine
chalk
at
bottom
stony
near
the
surface
in
some
places
here
and
there
a
in
the
hills
the
shape
of
the
ground
somewhat
like
that
of
the
broadest
valleys
in
wiltshire
but
the
fields
not
without
fences
as
they
are
there
fields
from
fifteen
to
forty
acres
the
hills
not
downs
as
in
wiltshire
but
cultivated
all
over
the
houses
white
and
thatched
as
they
are
in
all
chalk
countries
the
valley
at
scamblesby
has
a
little
rivulet
running
down
it
just
as
in
all
the
chalk
countries
the
land
continues
nearly
the
same
to
louth
which
lies
in
a
deep
dell
with
beautiful
pastures
on
the
surrounding
hills
like
those
that
i
once
admired
at
shaftesbury
in
dorsetshire
and
like
that
near
austle
in
cornwall
which
i
described
in
at
louth
the
wise
corporation
had
to
let
us
have
the
playhouse
but
my
friends
had
prepared
a
very
good
place
and
i
had
an
opportunity
of
addressing
crowded
audiences
two
nights
running
at
no
place
have
i
been
better
pleased
than
at
louth
paddison
solicitor
a
young
gentleman
whom
i
had
the
honour
to
know
slightly
before
and
to
know
whom
whether
i
estimate
by
character
or
by
talent
would
be
an
honour
to
any
man
was
particularly
attentive
to
us
naull
ironmonger
who
had
had
the
battle
to
fight
for
me
for
twenty
years
expressed
his
exultation
at
my
triumph
in
a
manner
that
showed
that
he
justly
participated
it
with
me
i
breakfasted
at
naull
with
a
gentleman
or
years
of
age
whose
joy
at
shaking
me
by
the
hand
was
excessive
ah
said
he
where
are
those
savages
who
at
hull
threatened
to
kill
me
for
raising
my
voice
against
this
system
this
is
a
very
fine
town
and
has
a
beautiful
church
nearly
equal
to
that
at
boston
we
left
louth
on
the
morning
of
thursday
the
and
got
to
barton
on
the
humber
by
about
noon
over
a
very
fine
country
large
fields
fine
pastures
flocks
of
those
great
sheep
of
from
to
in
a
flock
and
here
at
barton
we
arrived
at
the
northern
point
of
this
noble
county
having
never
seen
one
single
acre
of
waste
land
and
not
one
acre
that
would
be
called
bad
land
in
the
south
of
england
the
or
lie
away
to
our
right
from
horncastle
to
near
barton
and
on
the
other
side
of
the
wolds
lie
the
of
which
extend
along
the
coast
from
boston
to
the
mouth
of
the
humber
on
the
bank
of
which
we
were
at
barton
hull
being
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
river
which
is
here
about
five
miles
wide
and
which
we
had
to
cross
in
a
but
let
me
not
forget
great
grimsby
at
which
we
changed
horses
and
breakfasted
in
our
way
from
louth
to
barton
what
the
devil
the
reader
will
say
should
you
want
to
recollect
place
for
why
do
you
want
not
to
forget
that
sink
of
corruption
what
could
you
find
there
to
be
snatched
from
everlasting
oblivion
except
for
the
purpose
of
being
execrated
i
did
however
find
something
there
worthy
of
being
made
known
not
only
to
every
man
in
england
but
to
every
man
in
the
world
and
not
to
mention
it
here
would
be
to
be
guilty
of
the
greatest
injustice
to
my
surprise
i
found
a
good
many
people
assembled
at
the
evidently
expecting
my
arrival
while
breakfast
was
preparing
i
wished
to
speak
to
the
bookseller
of
the
place
if
there
were
one
and
to
give
him
a
list
of
my
books
and
writings
that
he
might
place
it
in
his
shop
when
he
came
i
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
had
it
already
and
that
he
occasionally
sold
my
books
upon
my
asking
him
how
he
got
it
he
said
that
it
was
brought
down
from
london
and
given
to
him
by
a
plaskitt
who
he
said
had
all
my
writings
and
who
he
said
he
was
sure
would
be
very
glad
to
see
me
but
that
he
lived
above
a
mile
from
the
town
a
messenger
however
had
gone
off
to
carry
the
news
and
plaskitt
arrived
before
we
had
done
breakfast
bringing
with
him
a
son
and
a
daughter
and
from
the
lips
of
this
gentleman
a
man
of
as
kind
and
benevolent
appearance
and
manners
as
i
ever
beheld
in
my
life
i
had
the
following
facts
namely
that
one
of
his
sons
sailed
for
new
york
some
years
ago
that
the
ship
was
cast
away
on
the
shores
of
long
island
that
the
captain
crew
and
passengers
all
perished
that
the
wrecked
vessel
was
taken
possession
of
by
people
on
the
coast
that
his
son
had
a
watch
in
his
trunk
or
chest
a
purse
with
fourteen
shillings
in
it
and
divers
articles
of
wearing
apparel
that
the
americans
who
searched
the
wreck
all
these
articles
safely
to
england
to
and
said
he
i
keep
the
purse
and
the
money
at
home
and
is
the
watch
in
my
it
would
have
been
worth
the
expense
of
coming
from
london
to
grimsby
if
for
nothing
but
to
learn
this
fact
which
i
record
not
only
in
justice
to
the
free
people
of
america
and
particularly
in
justice
to
my
late
neighbours
in
long
island
but
in
justice
to
the
character
of
mankind
i
publish
it
as
something
to
counterbalance
the
conduct
of
the
atrocious
monsters
who
plunder
the
wrecks
on
the
coast
of
cornwall
and
as
i
am
told
on
the
coasts
here
in
the
east
of
the
island
away
go
then
all
the
accusations
upon
the
character
of
the
yankees
people
may
call
them
and
when
they
have
exhausted
the
vocabulary
of
their
abuse
the
answer
is
found
in
this
one
fact
stated
by
joshua
plaskitt
of
great
grimsby
in
lincolnshire
old
england
the
person
who
sent
the
things
to
plaskitt
was
named
jones
it
did
not
occur
to
me
to
ask
his
christian
name
nor
to
inquire
what
was
the
particular
place
where
he
lived
in
long
island
i
request
plaskitt
to
contrive
to
let
me
know
these
particulars
as
i
should
like
to
communicate
them
to
friends
that
i
have
on
the
north
side
of
that
island
however
it
would
excite
no
surprise
there
that
one
of
their
countrymen
had
acted
this
part
for
every
man
of
them
having
the
same
opportunity
would
do
the
same
their
forefathers
carried
to
new
england
the
nature
and
character
of
the
people
of
old
england
before
national
debts
septennial
bills
standing
armies
and
jubilees
had
beggared
and
corrupted
the
people
at
hull
i
i
laugh
at
the
word
to
about
seven
hundred
persons
on
the
same
evening
that
i
arrived
from
louth
which
was
on
thursday
the
we
had
what
they
call
the
summer
theatre
which
was
crowded
in
every
part
except
on
the
stage
and
the
next
evening
the
stage
was
crowded
too
the
third
evening
was
merely
accidental
no
previous
notice
having
been
given
of
it
on
the
saturday
i
went
in
the
middle
of
the
day
to
beverley
saw
there
the
beautiful
minster
and
some
of
the
fine
horses
which
they
show
there
at
this
season
of
the
year
dined
with
about
fifty
farmers
made
a
speech
to
them
and
about
a
hundred
more
perhaps
and
got
back
to
hull
time
enough
to
go
to
the
theatre
there
the
country
round
hull
appears
to
exceed
even
that
of
lincolnshire
the
three
mornings
that
i
was
at
hull
i
walked
out
in
three
different
directions
and
found
the
country
everywhere
fine
to
the
east
lies
the
holderness
country
i
used
to
wonder
that
yorkshire
to
which
i
from
some
false
impression
in
my
youth
had
always
attached
the
idea
of
should
send
us
of
the
south
those
beautiful
cattle
with
short
horns
and
straight
and
deep
bodies
you
have
only
to
see
the
country
to
cease
to
wonder
at
this
it
lies
on
the
north
side
of
the
mouth
of
the
humber
is
as
flat
and
fat
as
the
land
between
holbeach
and
boston
without
as
they
tell
me
the
necessity
of
such
numerous
ditches
the
appellation
yorkshire
the
acute
sayings
ascribed
to
yorkshiremen
and
their
quick
manner
i
remember
in
the
army
when
speaking
of
what
country
a
man
was
one
used
to
say
in
defence
of
the
party
york
but
honest
another
saying
was
that
it
was
a
bare
common
that
a
yorkshireman
would
go
over
without
taking
a
bite
every
one
knows
the
story
of
the
gentleman
who
upon
finding
that
a
in
the
south
was
a
yorkshireman
and
expressing
his
surprise
that
he
was
not
become
master
of
the
inn
received
for
answer
ah
sir
but
master
is
york
too
and
that
of
the
yorkshire
boy
who
seeing
a
gentleman
eating
some
eggs
asked
the
cook
to
give
him
a
little
and
upon
being
asked
what
he
could
want
with
salt
he
said
perhaps
that
gentleman
may
give
me
an
egg
presently
it
is
surprising
what
effect
sayings
like
these
produce
upon
the
mind
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
kingdom
yorkshiremen
are
looked
upon
as
being
keener
than
other
people
more
eager
in
pursuit
of
their
own
interests
more
sharp
and
more
selfish
for
my
part
i
was
cured
with
regard
to
the
long
before
i
saw
yorkshire
in
the
army
where
we
see
men
of
all
counties
i
always
found
yorkshiremen
distinguished
for
their
frank
manners
and
generous
disposition
in
the
united
states
my
kind
and
generous
friends
of
pennsylvania
were
the
children
and
descendants
of
yorkshire
parents
and
in
truth
i
long
ago
made
up
my
mind
that
this
hardness
and
sharpness
ascribed
to
yorkshiremen
arose
from
the
sort
of
envy
excited
by
that
quickness
that
activity
that
buoyancy
of
spirits
which
bears
them
up
through
adverse
circumstances
and
their
conquent
success
in
all
the
situations
of
life
they
like
the
people
of
lancashire
are
just
the
very
reverse
of
being
and
be
they
farmers
or
be
they
what
they
may
you
get
at
the
bottom
of
their
hearts
in
a
minute
everything
they
think
soon
gets
to
the
tongue
and
out
it
comes
heads
and
tails
as
fast
as
they
can
pour
it
fine
materials
for
oliver
to
work
on
if
he
had
been
sent
to
the
instead
of
the
north
he
would
have
found
people
there
on
whom
he
would
have
exercised
his
powers
in
vain
you
are
not
to
have
every
valuable
quality
in
the
same
man
and
the
same
people
you
are
not
to
have
prudent
caution
united
with
quickness
and
volubility
but
though
as
to
the
character
of
the
i
having
known
so
many
hundreds
of
yorkshiremen
was
perfectly
enlightened
and
had
quite
got
the
better
of
all
prejudices
many
years
ago
i
still
in
spite
of
the
matchless
horses
and
matchless
cattle
had
a
general
impression
that
yorkshire
was
a
county
compared
with
the
counties
in
the
south
and
the
west
and
this
notion
was
confirmed
in
some
measure
by
my
seeing
the
moory
and
rocky
parts
in
the
west
riding
last
winter
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
come
and
see
the
country
on
the
banks
of
the
humber
i
have
seen
the
vale
of
honiton
in
devonshire
that
of
taunton
and
of
glastonbury
in
somersetshire
i
have
seen
the
vales
of
gloucester
and
worcester
and
the
banks
of
the
severn
and
the
avon
i
have
seen
the
vale
of
berkshire
that
of
aylesbury
in
buckinghamshire
i
have
seen
the
beautiful
vales
of
wiltshire
and
the
banks
of
the
medway
from
tunbridge
to
maidstone
called
the
garden
of
eden
i
was
born
at
one
end
of
arthur
young
finest
ten
miles
in
england
i
have
ridden
my
horse
across
the
thames
at
its
two
sources
and
i
have
been
along
every
inch
of
its
banks
from
its
sources
to
gravesend
whence
i
have
sailed
out
of
it
into
the
channel
and
having
seen
and
had
ability
to
judge
of
the
goodness
of
the
land
in
all
these
places
i
declare
that
i
have
never
seen
any
to
be
compared
with
the
land
on
the
banks
of
the
humber
from
the
holderness
country
included
and
with
the
exception
of
the
land
from
wisbeach
to
holbeach
and
holbeach
to
boston
really
the
single
parish
of
holbeach
or
a
patch
of
the
same
size
in
the
holderness
country
seems
to
be
equal
in
value
to
the
whole
of
the
county
of
surrey
if
we
leave
out
the
little
plot
of
at
farnham
nor
is
the
town
of
hull
itself
to
be
overlooked
it
is
a
little
city
of
london
streets
shops
everything
like
it
clean
as
the
best
parts
of
london
and
the
people
as
bustling
and
attentive
the
town
of
hull
is
with
commodious
docks
for
shipping
these
docks
are
separated
in
three
or
four
places
by
so
that
as
you
walk
round
the
town
you
walk
by
the
side
of
the
docks
and
the
ships
the
town
on
the
outside
of
the
docks
is
pretty
considerable
and
the
walks
from
it
into
the
country
beautiful
i
went
about
a
good
deal
and
i
nowhere
saw
marks
of
beggary
or
filth
even
in
the
outskirts
none
of
those
nasty
shabby
sheds
that
you
see
in
the
approaches
to
london
none
of
those
of
pernicious
and
insolent
luxury
i
hate
commercial
towns
in
general
there
is
generally
something
so
loathsome
in
the
look
and
so
stern
and
unfeeling
in
the
manners
of
seafaring
people
that
i
have
always
from
my
very
youth
disliked
but
really
the
sight
of
this
nice
town
the
manners
of
its
people
the
civil
and
kind
and
cordial
reception
that
i
met
with
and
the
clean
streets
and
especially
the
pretty
gardens
in
every
direction
as
you
walk
into
the
country
has
made
hull
though
a
a
place
that
i
shall
always
look
back
to
with
delight
beverley
which
was
formerly
a
very
considerable
city
with
three
or
four
gates
one
of
which
is
yet
standing
had
a
great
college
built
in
the
year
by
the
archbishop
of
york
it
had
three
famous
hospitals
and
two
friaries
there
is
one
church
a
very
fine
one
and
the
minster
still
left
of
which
a
bookseller
in
the
town
was
so
good
as
to
give
me
representations
it
is
still
a
very
pretty
town
the
market
large
the
land
all
round
the
country
good
and
it
is
particularly
famous
for
horses
those
for
speed
being
shown
off
here
on
the
at
this
time
of
the
year
the
farmers
and
gentlemen
assemble
in
a
very
wide
street
on
the
outside
of
the
western
gate
of
the
town
and
at
a
certain
time
of
the
day
the
grooms
come
from
their
different
stables
to
show
off
their
beautiful
horses
blood
horses
coach
horses
hunters
and
cart
horses
sometimes
they
tell
me
forty
or
fifty
in
number
the
day
that
i
was
there
being
late
in
the
season
there
were
only
seven
or
eight
or
ten
at
the
most
when
i
was
asked
at
the
inn
to
go
and
see
i
had
no
curiosity
thinking
it
was
such
a
parcel
of
horses
as
we
see
at
a
market
in
the
south
but
i
found
it
a
sight
worth
going
to
see
for
besides
the
beauty
of
the
horses
there
were
the
adroitness
the
agility
and
the
boldness
of
the
grooms
each
running
alongside
of
his
horse
with
the
latter
trotting
at
the
rate
of
ten
or
twelve
miles
an
hour
and
then
swinging
him
round
and
showing
him
off
to
the
best
advantage
in
short
i
was
exceedingly
gratified
by
the
trip
to
beverley
the
day
was
fair
and
mild
we
went
by
one
road
and
came
back
by
another
and
i
have
very
seldom
passed
a
pleasanter
day
in
my
life
i
found
very
much
to
my
surprise
that
at
hull
i
was
very
nearly
as
far
north
as
at
leeds
and
at
beverley
a
little
farther
north
of
all
things
in
the
world
i
wanted
to
speak
to
foster
of
the
but
was
not
aware
of
the
relative
situation
till
it
was
too
late
to
write
to
him
boats
go
up
the
humber
and
the
ouse
to
within
a
few
miles
of
leeds
the
holderness
country
is
that
piece
of
land
which
lies
between
hull
and
the
sea
it
appears
to
be
a
perfect
flat
and
is
said
to
be
and
i
dare
say
is
one
of
the
very
finest
spots
in
the
whole
kingdom
i
had
a
very
kind
invitation
to
go
into
it
but
i
could
not
stay
longer
on
that
side
of
the
humber
without
neglecting
some
duty
or
other
in
quitting
hull
i
left
behind
me
but
one
thing
the
sight
of
which
had
not
pleased
me
namely
a
fine
gilded
equestrian
statue
of
the
dutch
who
gave
to
england
the
national
debt
that
fruitful
mother
of
mischief
and
misery
until
this
statue
be
replaced
by
that
of
andrew
marvell
that
real
honour
of
this
town
england
will
never
be
what
it
ought
to
be
we
came
back
to
barton
by
the
on
sunday
in
the
afternoon
of
the
and
in
the
evening
reached
this
place
which
is
an
inn
with
three
or
four
houses
near
it
at
the
distance
of
ten
miles
from
lincoln
to
which
we
are
going
on
wednesday
the
between
this
place
and
barton
we
passed
through
a
delightfully
pretty
town
called
brigg
the
land
in
this
which
is
called
the
high
part
of
lincolnshire
has
generally
stone
a
solid
bed
of
stone
of
great
depth
at
different
distances
from
the
surface
in
some
parts
this
stone
is
of
a
yellowish
colour
and
in
the
form
of
very
thick
slate
and
in
these
parts
the
soil
is
not
so
good
but
generally
speaking
the
land
is
excellent
easily
tilled
no
surface
water
the
fields
very
large
not
many
trees
but
what
there
are
particularly
the
ash
very
fine
and
of
free
growth
and
innumerable
flocks
of
those
big
sheep
from
one
hundred
to
a
thousand
in
a
flock
each
having
from
eight
to
ten
pounds
of
wool
upon
its
body
one
of
the
finest
sights
in
the
world
is
one
of
these
thirty
or
fields
with
four
or
five
or
six
hundred
ewes
each
with
her
one
or
two
lambs
skipping
about
upon
grass
the
most
beautiful
that
can
be
conceived
and
on
lands
as
level
as
a
i
do
not
recollect
having
seen
a
or
an
since
i
came
into
the
country
and
not
one
acre
of
waste
land
though
i
have
gone
the
whole
length
of
the
country
one
way
and
am
now
got
nearly
half
way
back
another
way
having
seen
this
country
and
having
had
a
glimpse
at
the
holderness
country
which
lies
on
the
banks
of
the
sea
and
to
the
east
and
of
hull
can
i
cease
to
wonder
that
those
devils
the
danes
found
their
way
hither
so
often
there
were
the
fat
sheep
then
just
as
there
are
now
depend
upon
it
and
these
numbers
of
noble
churches
and
these
magnificent
minsters
were
reared
because
the
wealth
of
the
country
remained
the
and
was
not
carried
away
to
the
south
to
keep
swarms
of
devouring
to
cram
the
maws
of
wasteful
idlers
and
to
be
transferred
to
the
grasp
of
luxurious
and
blaspheming
jews
you
always
perceive
that
the
churches
are
large
and
fine
and
lofty
in
proportion
to
the
richness
of
the
soil
and
the
extent
of
the
parish
in
many
places
where
there
are
but
a
very
few
houses
and
those
comparatively
miserable
there
are
churches
that
look
like
cathedrals
it
is
quite
curious
to
observe
the
difference
in
the
style
of
the
churches
of
suffolk
and
norfolk
and
those
of
lincolnshire
and
of
the
other
bank
of
the
humber
in
the
former
two
counties
the
churches
are
good
large
and
with
a
good
plain
and
pretty
lofty
tower
and
in
a
few
instances
particularly
at
ipswich
and
long
melford
you
find
magnificence
in
these
buildings
but
in
lincolnshire
the
magnificence
of
the
churches
is
surprising
these
churches
are
the
indubitable
proof
of
great
and
solid
wealth
and
formerly
of
great
population
from
everything
that
i
have
heard
the
is
a
country
very
much
resembling
lincolnshire
and
they
say
that
the
church
at
antwerp
is
like
that
at
boston
but
my
opinion
is
that
lincolnshire
alone
contains
more
of
these
fine
buildings
than
the
whole
of
the
continent
of
europe
still
however
there
is
the
almost
total
want
of
the
there
had
been
a
shower
a
little
while
before
we
arrived
at
this
place
it
was
about
six
in
the
evening
and
there
is
a
thick
wood
together
with
the
orchards
and
gardens
very
near
to
the
inn
we
heard
a
little
twittering
from
one
thrush
but
at
that
very
moment
if
we
had
been
as
near
to
just
such
a
wood
in
surrey
or
hampshire
or
sussex
or
kent
we
should
have
heard
ten
thousand
birds
singing
altogether
and
the
thrushes
continuing
their
song
till
twenty
minutes
after
sunset
when
i
was
at
ipswich
the
gardens
and
plantations
round
that
beautiful
town
began
in
the
morning
to
ring
with
the
voices
of
the
different
birds
the
nightingale
is
i
believe
anywhere
on
the
eastern
side
of
lincolnshire
though
it
is
sometimes
heard
in
the
same
latitude
in
the
dells
of
yorkshire
how
ridiculous
it
is
to
suppose
that
these
frail
birds
with
their
slender
wings
and
proportionately
heavy
bodies
the
and
come
back
again
i
have
not
yet
heard
more
than
half
a
dozen
skylarks
and
i
have
only
last
year
heard
ten
at
a
time
make
the
air
ring
over
one
of
my
fields
at
this
is
a
great
drawback
from
the
pleasure
of
viewing
this
fine
country
it
is
time
for
me
now
withdrawing
myself
from
these
objects
visible
to
the
eye
to
speak
of
the
state
of
and
of
the
manner
in
which
their
affairs
are
affected
by
the
workings
of
the
system
with
regard
to
the
labourers
they
are
everywhere
miserable
the
wages
for
those
who
are
employed
on
the
land
are
through
all
the
counties
that
i
have
come
twelve
shillings
a
week
for
married
men
and
less
for
single
ones
but
a
large
part
of
them
are
not
even
at
this
season
employed
on
the
land
the
farmers
for
want
of
means
of
profitable
employment
suffer
the
men
to
fall
upon
the
parish
and
they
are
employed
in
digging
and
breaking
stone
for
the
roads
so
that
the
roads
are
nice
and
smooth
for
the
sheep
and
cattle
to
walk
on
in
their
way
to
the
jaws
of
the
jews
and
other
in
london
and
its
vicinity
none
of
the
best
meat
except
by
mere
accident
is
consumed
here
the
of
april
we
have
seen
hundreds
upon
hundreds
of
sheep
as
fat
as
hogs
go
by
this
inn
door
their
toes
like
those
of
the
at
the
entrance
of
the
lion
den
all
pointing
towards
the
wen
and
the
landlord
gave
us
for
dinner
a
little
skinny
hard
leg
of
old
ewe
mutton
where
the
man
got
it
i
can
not
imagine
thus
it
is
every
good
thing
is
literally
driven
or
carried
away
out
of
the
country
in
walking
out
yesterday
i
saw
three
poor
fellows
digging
stone
for
the
roads
who
told
me
that
they
never
had
anything
but
bread
to
eat
and
water
to
wash
it
down
one
of
them
was
a
widower
with
three
children
and
his
pay
was
that
is
to
say
about
three
pounds
of
bread
a
day
each
for
six
days
in
the
week
nothing
for
sunday
and
nothing
for
lodging
washing
clothing
or
fuel
just
such
was
the
state
of
things
in
france
at
the
eve
of
the
revolution
precisely
such
and
precisely
the
same
were
the
whether
the
effect
will
be
the
same
i
do
not
take
upon
myself
positively
to
determine
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
while
i
was
talking
to
these
men
i
saw
about
two
hundred
fat
sheep
in
a
rich
pasture
i
did
not
tell
them
what
i
might
have
told
them
but
i
explained
to
them
why
the
farmers
were
unable
to
give
them
a
sufficiency
of
wages
they
listened
with
great
attention
and
said
that
they
did
believe
that
the
farmers
were
in
great
distress
themselves
with
regard
to
the
farmers
it
is
said
here
that
the
far
greater
part
if
sold
up
would
be
found
to
be
insolvent
the
tradesmen
in
country
towns
are
and
must
be
in
but
little
better
state
they
all
tell
you
they
do
not
sell
half
so
many
goods
as
they
used
to
sell
and
of
course
the
manufacturers
must
suffer
in
the
like
degree
there
is
a
diminution
and
deterioration
every
one
says
in
the
stocks
upon
the
farms
is
a
sort
of
business
in
this
country
and
i
heard
at
boston
that
the
say
that
there
is
a
gradual
falling
off
in
point
of
the
numbers
of
sheep
washed
the
farmers
are
all
gradually
sinking
in
point
of
property
the
very
rich
ones
do
not
feel
that
ruin
is
absolutely
approaching
but
they
are
all
alarmed
and
as
to
the
poorer
ones
they
are
fast
falling
into
the
rank
of
paupers
when
i
was
at
ely
a
gentleman
who
appeared
to
be
a
great
farmer
told
me
in
presence
of
fifty
farmers
at
the
white
hart
inn
that
he
had
seen
that
morning
cracking
stones
on
the
road
as
paupers
of
the
parish
of
wilbarton
and
that
all
these
men
had
been
of
the
poor
of
that
same
parish
within
the
last
seven
wheat
keeps
up
in
price
to
about
an
average
of
seven
shillings
a
bushel
which
is
owing
to
our
two
successive
bad
harvests
but
fat
beef
and
pork
are
at
a
very
low
price
and
mutton
not
much
better
the
beef
was
selling
at
lynn
for
five
shillings
the
stone
of
fourteen
pounds
and
the
pork
at
four
and
sixpence
the
wool
one
of
the
great
articles
of
produce
in
these
countries
selling
for
less
than
half
of
its
former
price
and
here
let
me
stop
to
observe
that
i
was
well
informed
before
i
left
london
that
merchants
were
exporting
our
long
wool
to
france
where
it
paid
per
cent
well
say
the
landowners
but
we
have
to
thank
huskisson
for
this
at
any
rate
and
that
is
true
enough
for
the
law
was
most
rigid
against
the
export
of
wool
but
what
will
the
say
thus
the
collective
goes
on
smashing
one
class
and
then
another
and
resolved
to
adhere
to
the
taxes
it
knocks
away
one
after
another
the
props
of
the
system
itself
by
every
measure
that
it
adopts
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
security
or
of
affording
relief
to
the
people
it
does
some
act
of
crying
injustice
to
save
itself
from
the
natural
effects
of
its
own
measures
it
knocked
down
the
country
bankers
in
direct
violation
of
the
law
in
it
is
now
about
to
lay
its
heavy
hand
on
the
big
brewers
and
the
publicans
in
order
to
pacify
the
call
for
a
reduction
of
taxes
and
with
the
hope
of
preventing
such
reduction
in
reality
it
is
making
a
trifling
attempt
to
save
the
west
indians
from
total
ruin
and
the
west
india
colonies
from
revolt
but
by
that
same
attempt
it
reflects
injury
on
the
british
distillers
and
on
the
growers
of
barley
thus
it
can
not
do
justice
without
doing
injustice
it
can
not
do
good
without
doing
evil
and
thus
it
must
continue
to
do
until
it
take
off
in
reality
more
than
one
half
of
the
taxes
one
of
the
great
signs
of
the
poverty
of
people
in
the
middle
rank
of
life
is
the
falling
off
of
the
audiences
at
the
playhouses
there
is
a
playhouse
in
almost
every
country
town
where
the
players
used
to
act
occasionally
and
in
large
towns
almost
always
in
some
places
they
have
of
late
abandoned
acting
altogether
in
others
they
have
acted
very
frequently
to
not
more
than
or
twelve
at
norwich
the
playhouse
had
been
shut
up
for
a
long
time
i
heard
of
one
manager
who
has
become
a
porter
to
a
warehouse
and
his
company
dispersed
in
most
places
the
insides
of
the
buildings
seem
to
be
tumbling
to
pieces
and
the
curtains
and
scenes
that
they
let
down
seem
to
be
abandoned
to
the
damp
and
the
cobwebs
appearance
on
the
boards
seemed
to
give
new
life
to
the
drama
i
was
until
the
birth
of
my
third
son
a
constant
haunter
of
the
playhouse
in
which
i
took
great
delight
but
when
came
into
the
world
i
said
now
nancy
it
is
time
for
us
to
leave
off
going
to
the
play
it
is
really
melancholy
to
look
at
things
now
and
to
think
of
things
then
i
feel
great
sorrow
on
account
of
these
poor
players
for
though
they
are
made
the
tools
of
the
government
and
the
corporations
and
the
parsons
it
is
not
their
fault
and
they
have
uniformly
whenever
i
have
come
in
contact
with
them
been
very
civil
to
me
i
am
not
sorry
that
they
are
left
out
of
the
list
of
vagrants
in
the
new
act
but
in
this
case
as
in
so
many
others
the
men
have
to
be
grateful
to
the
for
who
believes
that
this
merciful
omission
would
have
taken
place
if
so
many
of
the
peers
had
not
contracted
matrimonial
alliances
with
players
if
so
many
playeresses
had
not
become
peeresses
we
may
thank
god
for
disposing
the
hearts
of
our
to
be
guilty
of
the
same
sins
and
foibles
as
ourselves
for
when
a
lord
had
been
sentenced
to
the
pillory
the
use
of
that
ancient
mode
of
punishing
offences
was
abolished
when
a
lord
castlereagh
who
was
also
a
minister
of
state
had
cut
his
own
throat
the
degrading
punishment
of
burial
in
was
abolished
and
now
when
so
many
peers
and
great
men
have
taken
to
wife
which
the
law
termed
that
term
as
applied
to
the
children
of
melpomene
and
thalia
is
abolished
laud
we
the
gods
that
our
rulers
can
not
after
all
divest
themselves
of
flesh
and
blood
for
the
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
if
their
great
souls
were
once
to
soar
above
that
tenement
lord
stanhope
cautioned
his
brother
peers
a
little
while
ago
against
the
angry
feeling
which
was
up
in
the
poor
against
the
his
lordship
is
a
wise
and
humane
man
and
this
is
evident
from
all
his
conduct
nor
is
this
angry
feeling
confined
to
the
counties
in
the
south
where
the
rage
of
the
people
from
the
very
nature
of
the
local
circumstances
is
more
formidable
woods
and
coppices
and
dingles
and
and
sticks
and
stones
ever
at
hand
being
resources
unknown
in
counties
like
this
when
i
was
at
ives
in
huntingdonshire
an
open
country
i
sat
with
the
farmers
and
smoked
a
pipe
by
way
of
preparation
for
evening
service
which
i
performed
on
a
carpenter
bench
in
a
wheelwright
shop
my
friends
the
players
never
having
gained
any
regular
settlement
in
that
grand
mart
for
fat
meat
coming
from
the
fens
and
bound
to
the
wen
while
we
were
sitting
a
was
handed
round
the
table
advertising
for
sale
and
amongst
the
implements
of
husbandry
an
several
steel
traps
and
spring
and
that
is
the
life
is
it
of
an
i
walked
on
about
six
miles
of
the
road
from
holbeach
to
boston
i
have
before
observed
upon
the
inexhaustible
riches
of
this
land
at
the
end
of
about
five
miles
and
three
quarters
i
came
to
a
and
thought
i
would
get
some
breakfast
but
the
poor
woman
with
a
tribe
of
children
about
her
had
not
a
morsel
of
either
meat
or
bread
at
a
house
called
an
inn
a
little
further
on
the
landlord
had
no
meat
except
a
little
bit
of
chine
of
bacon
and
though
there
were
a
good
many
houses
near
the
spot
the
landlord
told
me
that
the
people
were
become
so
poor
that
the
butchers
had
left
off
killing
meat
in
the
neighbourhood
just
the
state
of
things
that
existed
in
france
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
on
that
very
spot
i
looked
round
me
and
counted
more
than
two
thousand
fat
sheep
in
the
pastures
how
long
how
long
good
god
is
this
state
of
things
to
last
how
long
will
these
people
starve
in
the
midst
of
plenty
how
long
will
steel
traps
and
spring
guns
be
in
such
a
state
of
things
a
protection
to
property
when
i
was
at
beverley
a
gentleman
told
me
it
was
dawson
of
that
place
that
some
time
before
a
farmer
had
been
sold
up
by
his
landlord
and
that
in
a
few
weeks
afterwards
the
farmhouse
was
on
fire
and
that
when
the
servants
of
the
landlord
arrived
to
put
it
out
they
found
the
handle
of
the
pump
taken
away
and
that
the
homestead
was
totally
destroyed
this
was
told
me
in
the
presence
of
several
gentlemen
who
all
spoke
of
it
as
a
fact
of
perfect
notoriety
another
respect
in
which
our
situation
so
exactly
resembles
that
of
france
on
the
eve
of
the
revolution
is
the
from
the
in
every
direction
when
i
was
in
norfolk
there
were
four
hundred
persons
generally
young
men
labourers
carpenters
wheelwrights
millwrights
smiths
and
bricklayers
most
of
them
with
some
money
and
some
farmers
and
others
with
good
round
sums
these
people
were
going
to
quebec
in
and
from
quebec
by
land
into
the
united
states
they
had
been
told
that
they
would
not
be
suffered
to
land
in
the
united
states
from
on
board
of
ship
the
roguish
villains
had
deceived
them
but
no
matter
they
will
get
into
the
united
states
and
going
through
canada
will
do
them
good
for
it
will
teach
them
to
detest
everything
belonging
to
it
from
boston
two
great
barge
loads
had
just
gone
off
by
canal
to
liverpool
most
of
them
farmers
all
carrying
some
money
and
some
as
much
as
two
thousand
pounds
each
from
the
north
and
west
riding
of
yorkshire
numerous
wagons
have
gone
carrying
people
to
the
canals
leading
to
liverpool
and
a
gentleman
whom
i
saw
at
peterboro
told
me
that
he
saw
some
of
them
and
that
the
men
all
appeared
to
be
respectable
farmers
at
hull
the
scene
would
delight
the
eyes
of
the
wise
burdett
for
here
the
emigration
is
going
on
in
the
old
roman
plan
ten
large
ships
have
gone
this
spring
laden
with
these
fugitives
from
the
fangs
of
taxation
some
bound
direct
to
the
ports
of
the
united
states
others
like
those
at
yarmouth
for
quebec
those
that
have
most
money
go
direct
to
the
united
states
the
single
men
who
are
taken
for
a
mere
trifle
in
the
canada
ships
go
that
way
have
nothing
but
their
carcasses
to
carry
over
the
rocks
and
swamps
and
through
the
myriads
of
and
pensioners
in
that
miserable
region
there
are
about
fifteen
more
ships
going
from
this
one
port
this
spring
the
ships
are
fitted
up
with
berths
as
transports
for
the
carrying
of
troops
i
went
on
board
one
morning
and
saw
the
people
putting
their
things
on
board
and
stowing
them
away
seeing
a
nice
young
woman
with
a
little
baby
in
her
arms
i
told
her
that
she
was
going
to
a
country
where
she
would
be
sure
that
her
children
would
never
want
victuals
where
she
might
make
her
own
malt
soap
and
candles
without
being
half
put
to
death
for
it
and
where
the
blaspheming
jews
would
not
have
a
mortgage
on
the
labour
of
her
children
there
is
at
hull
one
farmer
going
who
is
seventy
years
of
age
but
who
takes
out
five
sons
and
fifteen
hundred
pounds
brave
and
sensible
old
man
and
good
and
affectionate
father
he
is
performing
a
truly
parental
and
sacred
duty
and
he
will
die
with
the
blessing
of
his
sons
on
his
head
for
having
rescued
them
from
this
scene
of
slavery
misery
cruelty
and
crime
come
then
wilmot
horton
with
your
sensible
associates
burdett
and
poulett
thomson
come
into
lincolnshire
norfolk
and
yorkshire
come
and
bring
parson
malthus
along
with
you
regale
your
sight
with
this
delightful
stream
of
emigration
congratulate
the
greatest
captain
of
the
age
and
your
brethren
of
the
collective
congratulate
the
noblest
assembly
of
free
men
on
these
the
happy
effects
of
their
measures
oh
no
wilmot
oh
no
generous
and
sensible
burdett
it
is
not
the
aged
the
infirm
the
halt
the
blind
and
the
idiots
that
go
it
is
the
youth
the
strength
the
wealth
and
the
spirit
that
will
no
longer
brook
hunger
and
thirst
in
order
that
the
maws
of
and
jews
may
be
crammed
you
want
the
irish
to
go
and
so
they
will
our
and
all
the
bad
of
them
to
be
kept
at
our
expense
on
the
rocks
and
swamps
of
nova
scotia
and
canada
you
have
no
money
to
send
them
away
with
the
want
it
all
and
thanks
to
the
improvements
of
the
age
the
will
continue
to
bring
them
in
shoals
in
pursuit
of
the
orts
of
the
food
that
their
have
taken
away
from
them
after
evening
lecture
at
horncastle
a
very
decent
farmer
came
to
me
and
asked
me
about
america
telling
me
that
he
was
resolved
to
go
for
that
if
he
stayed
much
longer
he
should
not
have
a
shilling
to
go
with
i
promised
to
send
him
a
letter
from
louth
to
a
friend
at
new
york
who
might
be
useful
to
him
there
and
give
him
good
advice
i
forgot
it
at
louth
but
i
will
do
it
before
i
go
to
bed
from
the
thames
and
from
the
several
ports
down
the
channel
about
two
thousand
have
gone
this
spring
all
the
flower
of
the
labourers
of
the
east
of
sussex
and
west
of
kent
will
be
culled
out
and
sent
off
in
a
short
time
from
glasgow
the
sensible
scotch
are
pouring
out
amain
those
that
are
poor
and
can
not
pay
their
passages
or
can
rake
together
only
a
trifle
are
going
to
a
rascally
heap
of
sand
and
rock
and
swamp
called
prince
island
in
the
horrible
gulf
of
lawrence
but
when
the
american
vessels
come
over
with
indian
corn
and
flour
and
pork
and
beef
and
poultry
and
eggs
and
butter
and
cabbages
and
green
pease
and
asparagus
for
the
and
other
that
we
support
upon
that
lump
of
worthlessness
for
the
lump
itself
bears
nothing
but
potatoes
when
these
vessels
come
which
they
are
continually
doing
winter
and
summer
towards
the
fall
with
apples
and
pears
and
melons
and
cucumbers
and
in
short
everlastingly
coming
and
taking
away
the
amount
of
taxes
raised
in
england
when
these
vessels
return
the
sensible
scotch
will
go
back
in
them
for
a
dollar
a
head
till
at
last
not
a
man
of
them
will
be
left
but
the
those
villanous
colonies
are
held
for
no
earthly
purpose
but
that
of
furnishing
a
pretence
of
giving
money
to
the
relations
and
dependents
of
the
aristocracy
and
they
are
the
nicest
channels
in
the
world
through
which
to
send
english
taxes
to
enrich
and
strengthen
the
united
states
withdraw
the
english
taxes
and
except
in
a
small
part
in
canada
the
whole
of
those
horrible
regions
would
be
left
to
the
bears
and
the
savages
in
the
course
of
a
year
this
emigration
is
a
famous
blow
given
to
the
the
way
to
new
york
is
now
as
well
known
and
as
easy
and
as
little
expensive
as
from
old
york
to
london
first
the
sussex
parishes
sent
their
paupers
they
invited
over
others
that
were
not
paupers
they
invited
over
people
of
some
property
then
persons
of
greater
property
now
substantial
farmers
are
going
men
of
considerable
fortune
will
follow
it
is
the
letters
written
across
the
atlantic
that
do
the
business
men
of
fortune
will
soon
discover
that
to
secure
to
their
families
their
fortunes
and
to
take
these
out
of
the
grasp
of
the
inexorable
they
must
get
away
every
one
that
goes
will
take
twenty
after
him
and
thus
it
will
go
on
there
can
be
no
interruption
but
and
war
the
thing
dares
not
have
as
to
france
or
the
netherlands
or
any
part
of
that
hell
called
germany
englishmen
can
never
settle
there
the
united
states
form
another
england
without
its
unbearable
taxes
its
insolent
its
intolerable
and
its
eastern
tour
ended
midland
tour
begun
april
from
the
inn
at
spittal
we
came
to
this
famous
ancient
roman
station
and
afterwards
grand
scene
of
saxon
and
gothic
splendour
on
the
it
was
the
third
or
fourth
day
of
the
which
is
one
of
the
greatest
in
the
kingdom
and
which
lasts
for
a
whole
week
horses
begin
the
fair
then
come
sheep
and
the
it
is
supposed
that
there
were
about
sheep
and
i
think
the
whole
of
the
space
in
the
various
roads
and
streets
covered
by
the
cattle
must
have
amounted
to
ten
acres
of
ground
or
more
some
say
that
they
were
as
numerous
as
the
sheep
the
number
of
horses
i
did
not
hear
but
they
say
that
there
were
fewer
in
number
than
last
year
the
sheep
sold
a
head
on
an
average
lower
than
last
year
and
the
cattle
in
the
same
proportion
horses
sold
well
but
the
horses
which
are
called
tradesmen
horses
were
very
low
this
is
the
natural
march
of
the
thing
those
who
live
on
the
taxes
have
money
to
throw
away
but
those
who
them
are
ruined
and
have
of
course
no
money
to
lay
out
on
horses
the
country
from
spittal
to
lincoln
continued
to
be
much
about
the
same
as
from
barton
to
spittal
large
fields
rather
light
loam
at
top
stone
under
about
half
and
the
rest
grass
not
so
many
sheep
as
in
the
richer
lands
but
a
great
many
still
as
you
get
on
towards
lincoln
the
ground
gradually
rises
and
you
go
on
the
road
made
by
the
romans
when
you
come
to
the
city
you
find
the
ancient
castle
and
the
magnificent
cathedral
on
the
of
a
sort
of
ridge
which
ends
here
for
you
look
all
of
a
sudden
down
into
a
deep
valley
where
the
greater
part
of
the
remaining
city
lies
it
once
had
it
has
now
only
eight
and
only
about
inhabitants
the
cathedral
is
i
believe
the
building
in
the
whole
all
the
others
that
i
have
seen
and
i
have
seen
all
in
england
except
chester
york
carlisle
and
durham
are
little
things
compared
with
this
to
the
task
of
describing
a
of
its
striking
beauties
i
am
inadequate
it
surpasses
greatly
all
that
i
had
anticipated
and
oh
how
loudly
it
gives
the
lie
to
those
brazen
scotch
historians
who
would
have
us
believe
that
england
was
formerly
a
country
the
whole
revenue
raised
from
lincolnshire
even
by
this
present
system
of
taxation
would
not
rear
such
another
pile
in
two
hundred
years
some
of
the
city
gates
are
down
but
there
is
one
standing
the
arch
of
which
is
said
to
be
two
thousand
years
old
and
a
most
curious
thing
it
is
the
sight
of
the
cathedral
fills
the
mind
alternately
with
wonder
admiration
melancholy
and
rage
wonder
at
its
grandeur
and
magnificence
admiration
of
the
zeal
and
disinterestedness
of
those
who
here
devoted
to
the
honour
of
god
those
immense
means
which
they
might
have
applied
to
their
own
enjoyments
melancholy
at
its
present
neglected
state
and
indignation
against
those
who
now
enjoy
the
revenues
belonging
to
it
and
who
creep
about
it
merely
as
a
pretext
for
devouring
a
part
of
the
fruit
of
the
people
labour
there
are
no
men
in
england
who
ought
to
wish
for
so
anxiously
as
the
working
clergy
of
the
church
of
england
we
are
all
oppressed
but
they
are
oppressed
and
insulted
more
than
any
men
that
ever
lived
in
the
world
the
clergy
in
america
i
mean
in
free
america
not
in
our
beggarly
colonies
where
clerical
insolence
and
partiality
prevail
still
more
than
here
i
mean
in
the
united
states
where
every
man
gives
what
he
pleases
and
no
more
the
clergy
of
the
episcopal
church
are
a
hundred
times
better
off
than
the
working
clergy
are
here
they
are
also
much
more
respected
because
their
has
not
to
bear
the
blame
of
enormous
exactions
which
exactions
here
are
swallowed
up
by
the
aristocracy
and
their
dependents
but
which
swallowings
are
imputed
to
every
one
bearing
the
name
of
parson
throughout
the
whole
country
i
have
maintained
the
necessity
and
the
justice
of
resuming
the
church
property
but
i
have
never
failed
to
say
that
i
know
of
no
more
meritorious
and
men
than
the
working
clergy
of
the
established
church
april
at
the
famous
ancient
city
of
lincoln
i
had
crowded
audiences
principally
consisting
of
farmers
on
the
and
exceedingly
audiences
and
great
impression
produced
one
of
the
evenings
in
pointing
out
to
them
the
wisdom
of
explaining
to
their
labourers
the
cause
of
their
distress
in
order
to
ward
off
the
effects
of
the
resentment
which
the
labourers
now
feel
everywhere
against
the
farmers
i
related
to
them
what
my
labourers
at
had
been
doing
since
i
left
home
and
i
repeated
to
them
the
complaints
that
my
labourers
made
stating
to
them
from
memory
the
following
parts
of
that
spirited
petition
that
your
petitioners
have
recently
observed
that
many
great
sums
of
the
money
part
of
which
we
pay
have
been
voted
to
be
given
to
persons
who
render
no
services
to
the
country
some
of
which
sums
we
will
mention
here
that
the
sum
of
has
been
voted
for
disbanded
officers
their
and
that
your
petitioners
know
that
ever
since
the
peace
this
charge
has
been
annually
made
that
it
has
been
on
an
average
and
that
of
course
this
band
of
foreigners
have
actually
taken
away
out
of
england
since
the
peace
one
million
and
seven
hundred
thousand
pounds
partly
taken
from
the
fruit
of
our
labour
and
if
our
dinners
were
actually
taken
from
our
table
and
carried
over
to
hanover
the
process
could
not
be
to
our
eyes
more
visible
than
it
now
is
and
we
are
astonished
that
those
who
fear
that
we
who
make
the
land
bring
forth
crops
and
who
make
the
clothing
and
the
houses
shall
swallow
up
the
rental
appear
to
think
nothing
at
all
of
the
swallowings
of
these
hanoverian
men
women
and
children
who
may
continue
thus
to
swallow
for
half
a
century
to
come
that
the
advocates
of
the
project
for
sending
us
out
of
our
country
to
the
rocks
and
snows
of
nova
scotia
and
the
swamps
and
wilds
of
canada
have
insisted
on
the
necessity
of
amongst
us
in
order
to
cause
a
decrease
in
our
numbers
that
however
while
this
is
insisted
on
in
your
honourable
house
we
perceive
a
part
of
our
own
earnings
voted
away
to
encourage
marriage
amongst
those
who
do
not
work
and
who
live
at
our
expense
and
that
to
your
petitioners
it
does
seem
most
wonderful
that
there
should
be
persons
to
fear
that
we
the
labourers
shall
on
account
of
our
numbers
swallow
up
the
rental
while
they
actually
vote
away
our
food
and
raiment
to
increase
the
numbers
of
those
who
never
have
produced
and
who
never
will
produce
anything
useful
to
man
that
your
petitioners
know
that
more
than
of
the
whole
of
their
wages
is
taken
from
them
by
the
taxes
that
these
taxes
go
chiefly
into
the
hands
of
idlers
that
your
petitioners
are
the
bees
and
that
the
are
the
drones
and
they
know
further
that
while
there
is
a
project
for
sending
the
bees
out
of
the
country
no
one
proposes
to
send
away
the
drones
but
that
your
petitioners
hope
to
see
the
day
when
the
checking
of
the
increase
of
the
drones
and
not
of
the
bees
will
be
the
object
of
an
english
parliament
that
in
consequence
of
taxes
your
petitioners
pay
for
a
pot
of
worse
beer
than
they
could
make
for
one
penny
that
they
pay
ten
shillings
for
a
pair
of
shoes
that
they
could
have
for
five
shillings
that
they
pay
for
a
pound
of
soap
or
candles
that
they
could
have
for
that
they
pay
for
a
pound
of
sugar
that
they
could
have
for
that
they
pay
six
shillings
for
a
pound
of
tea
that
they
could
have
for
two
shillings
that
they
pay
double
for
their
bread
and
meat
of
what
they
would
have
to
pay
if
there
were
no
idlers
to
be
kept
out
of
the
taxes
that
therefore
it
is
the
taxes
that
make
their
wages
insufficient
for
their
support
and
that
compel
them
to
apply
for
aid
to
the
that
knowing
these
things
they
feel
indignant
at
hearing
themselves
described
as
while
so
many
thousands
of
idlers
for
whose
support
they
pay
taxes
are
called
and
and
that
they
feel
indignant
at
hearing
themselves
described
as
a
nuisance
to
be
got
rid
of
while
the
idlers
who
live
upon
their
earnings
are
upheld
caressed
and
cherished
as
if
they
were
the
sole
support
of
the
country
having
repeated
to
them
these
passages
i
proceeded
my
workmen
were
induced
thus
to
petition
in
consequence
of
the
information
which
i
their
master
had
communicated
to
them
and
gentlemen
why
should
not
your
labourers
petition
in
the
same
strain
why
should
you
suffer
them
to
remain
in
a
state
of
ignorance
relative
to
the
cause
of
their
misery
the
eye
sweeps
over
in
this
county
more
riches
in
one
moment
than
are
contained
in
the
whole
county
in
which
i
was
born
and
in
which
the
petitioners
live
between
holbeach
and
boston
even
at
a
neither
bread
nor
meat
was
to
be
found
and
while
the
landlord
was
telling
me
that
the
people
were
become
so
poor
that
the
butchers
killed
no
meat
in
the
neighbourhood
i
counted
more
than
two
thousand
fat
sheep
lying
about
in
the
pastures
in
that
richest
spot
in
the
whole
world
starvation
in
the
midst
of
plenty
the
land
covered
with
food
and
the
working
people
without
victuals
everything
taken
away
by
the
of
various
descriptions
and
yet
you
take
no
measures
for
redress
and
your
miserable
labourers
seem
to
be
doomed
to
expire
with
hunger
without
an
effort
to
obtain
relief
what
can
not
you
point
out
to
them
the
real
cause
of
their
sufferings
can
not
you
take
a
piece
of
paper
and
write
out
a
petition
for
them
can
not
your
labourers
petition
as
well
as
mine
are
god
blessings
bestowed
on
you
without
any
spirit
to
preserve
them
is
the
fatness
of
the
land
is
the
earth
teeming
with
food
for
the
body
and
raiment
for
the
back
to
be
an
apology
for
the
want
of
that
courage
for
which
your
fathers
were
so
famous
is
the
abundance
which
god
has
put
into
your
hands
to
be
the
excuse
for
your
resigning
yourselves
to
starvation
my
god
is
there
no
spirit
left
in
england
except
in
the
miserable
of
surrey
these
words
were
not
uttered
without
effect
i
can
assure
the
reader
the
assemblage
was
of
that
stamp
in
which
thought
goes
before
expression
but
the
effect
of
this
example
of
my
men
in
surrey
will
i
am
sure
be
greater
than
anything
that
has
been
done
in
the
petitioning
way
for
a
long
time
past
we
left
lincoln
on
the
about
noon
and
got
to
newark
in
nottinghamshire
in
the
evening
where
i
gave
a
lecture
at
the
theatre
to
about
three
hundred
persons
newark
is
a
very
fine
town
and
the
castle
inn
where
we
stopped
extraordinarily
good
and
pleasantly
situated
here
i
was
met
by
a
parcel
of
the
printed
petitions
of
the
labourers
at
i
shall
continue
to
as
i
proceed
on
my
way
it
should
have
been
stated
at
the
head
of
the
printed
petition
that
it
was
presented
to
the
house
of
lords
by
his
grace
the
duke
of
richmond
and
by
pallmer
to
the
house
of
commons
the
country
from
lincoln
to
newark
sixteen
miles
is
by
no
means
so
fine
as
that
which
we
have
been
in
for
so
many
weeks
the
land
is
clayey
in
many
parts
a
pleasant
country
a
variety
of
hill
and
valley
but
not
that
richness
which
we
had
so
long
had
under
our
eye
fields
smaller
fewer
sheep
and
those
not
so
large
and
so
manifestly
loaded
with
flesh
the
roads
always
good
newark
is
a
town
very
much
like
nottingham
having
a
very
fine
and
spacious
the
buildings
everywhere
good
but
it
is
in
the
villages
that
you
find
the
depth
of
misery
having
appointed
positively
to
be
at
leicester
in
the
evening
of
saturday
the
we
could
not
stop
either
at
grantham
or
at
melton
mowbray
not
even
long
enough
to
view
their
fine
old
magnificent
churches
in
going
from
newark
to
grantham
we
got
again
into
lincolnshire
in
which
last
county
grantham
is
from
newark
nearly
to
melton
mowbray
the
country
is
about
the
same
as
between
lincoln
and
newark
by
no
means
bad
land
but
not
so
rich
as
that
of
lincolnshire
in
the
middle
and
eastern
parts
not
approaching
to
the
holderness
country
in
point
of
riches
a
large
part
arable
land
well
tilled
but
not
such
large
homesteads
such
numerous
great
stacks
of
wheat
and
such
endless
flocks
of
lazy
sheep
before
we
got
to
melton
mowbray
the
beautiful
pastures
of
this
little
verdant
county
of
leicester
began
to
appear
meadows
and
green
fields
with
here
and
there
a
corn
field
all
of
smaller
dimensions
than
those
of
lincolnshire
but
all
very
beautiful
with
gentle
hills
and
woods
too
not
beautiful
woods
like
those
of
hampshire
and
of
the
wilds
of
surrey
sussex
and
kent
but
very
pretty
all
the
country
around
being
so
rich
at
mowbray
we
began
to
get
amongst
the
leicestershire
sheep
those
fat
creatures
which
we
see
the
butchers
boys
battering
about
so
unmercifully
in
the
streets
and
the
outskirts
of
the
wen
the
land
is
warmer
here
than
in
lincolnshire
the
grass
more
forward
and
the
wheat
between
mowbray
and
leicester
six
inches
high
and
generally
looking
exceedingly
well
in
lincolnshire
and
nottinghamshire
i
found
the
wheat
in
general
rather
thin
and
frequently
sickly
nothing
like
so
promising
as
in
suffolk
and
norfolk
we
got
to
leicester
on
the
at
about
five
and
the
time
appointed
for
the
lecture
was
six
leicester
is
a
very
fine
town
spacious
streets
fine
inns
fine
shops
and
containing
they
say
thirty
or
forty
thousand
people
it
is
well
stocked
with
jails
of
which
a
new
one
in
addition
to
the
rest
has
just
been
built
covering
three
acres
of
ground
and
as
if
of
it
the
grand
portal
has
little
turrets
in
the
castle
style
with
in
miniature
on
the
caps
of
the
turrets
nothing
speaks
the
want
of
reflection
in
the
people
so
much
as
the
which
they
appear
to
feel
in
these
edifices
in
their
several
towns
instead
of
expressing
shame
at
these
indubitable
proofs
of
the
horrible
increase
of
misery
and
of
crime
they
really
boast
of
these
improvements
as
they
call
them
our
forefathers
built
abbeys
and
priories
and
churches
and
they
made
such
use
of
them
that
jails
were
nearly
unnecessary
we
their
sons
have
knocked
down
the
abbeys
and
priories
suffered
half
the
and
churches
to
pretty
nearly
tumble
down
and
make
such
uses
of
the
remainder
that
jails
and
and
dungeons
have
now
become
the
most
striking
edifices
in
every
county
in
the
kingdom
yesterday
morning
sunday
the
i
walked
out
to
the
village
of
knighton
two
miles
on
the
bosworth
road
where
i
breakfasted
and
then
walked
back
this
morning
i
walked
out
to
hailstone
nearly
three
miles
on
the
lutterworth
road
and
got
my
breakfast
there
you
have
nothing
to
do
but
to
walk
through
these
villages
to
see
the
cause
of
the
increase
of
the
jails
standing
on
the
hill
at
knighton
you
see
the
three
ancient
and
lofty
and
beautiful
spires
rising
up
at
leicester
you
see
the
river
winding
down
through
a
broad
bed
of
the
most
beautiful
meadows
that
man
ever
set
his
eyes
on
you
see
the
bright
verdure
covering
all
the
land
even
to
the
tops
of
the
hills
with
here
and
there
a
little
wood
as
if
made
by
god
to
give
variety
to
the
beauty
of
the
scene
for
the
river
brings
the
coal
in
abundance
for
fuel
and
the
earth
gives
the
brick
and
the
tile
in
abundance
but
go
down
into
the
villages
invited
by
the
spires
rising
up
amongst
the
trees
in
the
dells
at
scarcely
ever
more
than
a
mile
or
two
apart
invited
by
these
spires
go
down
into
these
villages
view
the
large
and
once
the
most
beautiful
churches
see
the
parson
house
large
and
in
the
midst
of
and
then
look
at
the
miserable
sheds
in
which
the
labourers
reside
look
at
these
hovels
made
of
mud
and
of
straw
bits
of
glass
or
of
old
windows
without
frames
or
hinges
frequently
but
merely
stuck
in
the
mud
wall
enter
them
and
look
at
the
bits
of
chairs
or
stools
the
wretched
boards
tacked
together
to
serve
for
a
table
the
floor
of
pebble
broken
brick
or
of
the
bare
ground
look
at
the
thing
called
a
bed
and
survey
the
rags
on
the
backs
of
the
wretched
inhabitants
and
then
wonder
if
you
can
that
the
jails
and
dungeons
and
increase
and
that
a
standing
army
and
barracks
are
become
the
favourite
establishments
of
england
at
the
village
of
hailstone
i
got
into
the
purlieu
as
they
call
it
in
hampshire
of
a
person
well
known
in
the
wen
namely
the
reverend
beresford
rector
of
that
fat
affair
andrew
holborn
in
walking
through
the
village
and
surveying
its
deplorable
dwellings
so
much
worse
than
the
of
the
cottagers
on
the
skirts
of
the
forests
in
hampshire
my
attention
was
attracted
by
the
surprising
contrast
between
them
and
the
house
of
their
religious
teacher
i
met
a
labouring
man
country
people
if
you
have
ever
made
a
of
any
sort
of
description
if
you
have
anything
about
you
of
which
you
do
not
want
all
the
world
to
know
never
retire
to
a
village
keep
in
some
great
town
but
the
wen
for
your
life
for
there
the
neighbour
will
not
know
even
your
name
and
the
vicinage
will
judge
of
you
solely
by
the
quantity
of
money
that
you
have
to
spend
this
labourer
seemed
not
to
be
in
a
very
great
hurry
he
was
digging
in
his
garden
and
i
looking
over
a
low
hedge
him
for
a
gossip
commencing
by
asking
him
whether
that
was
the
parson
house
having
answered
in
the
affirmative
and
i
having
asked
the
name
he
proceeded
thus
his
name
is
beresford
but
though
he
lives
there
he
has
not
this
living
now
he
has
got
the
living
of
andrew
holborn
and
they
say
it
is
worth
a
great
many
thousands
a
year
he
could
not
they
say
keep
this
living
and
have
that
too
because
they
were
so
far
apart
and
so
this
living
was
given
to
brown
who
is
the
rector
of
hobey
about
seven
miles
off
well
said
i
but
comes
beresford
to
live
here
if
the
living
be
given
to
another
man
why
sir
said
he
this
beresford
married
a
daughter
of
brown
and
so
you
know
smiling
and
looking
very
archly
brown
comes
and
takes
the
payment
for
the
tithes
and
pays
a
curate
that
lives
in
that
house
there
in
the
field
and
beresford
lives
at
that
fine
house
still
just
as
he
used
to
do
i
asked
him
what
the
living
was
worth
and
he
answered
twelve
hundred
pounds
a
year
it
is
a
rectory
i
find
and
of
course
the
parson
has
great
tithes
as
well
as
small
the
people
of
this
village
know
a
great
deal
more
about
beresford
than
the
people
of
andrew
holborn
know
about
him
in
short
the
country
people
know
all
about
the
whole
thing
they
will
be
long
before
they
act
but
they
will
make
no
noise
as
a
signal
for
action
they
will
be
moved
by
nothing
but
actual
want
of
food
this
the
thing
seems
to
be
aware
of
and
hence
all
the
innumerable
schemes
for
keeping
them
quiet
hence
the
endless
jails
and
all
the
terrors
of
hardened
law
hence
the
schemes
for
coaxing
them
by
letting
them
have
bits
of
land
hence
the
everlasting
bills
and
discussions
of
committees
about
the
state
of
the
poor
and
the
state
of
the
all
of
which
will
fail
and
at
last
unless
reduction
of
taxation
speedily
take
place
the
schemers
will
find
what
the
consequences
are
of
reducing
millions
to
the
verge
of
starvation
the
labourers
here
who
are
in
need
of
parochial
relief
are
formed
into
what
are
called
that
is
to
say
they
are
sent
round
from
one
farmer
to
another
each
maintaining
a
certain
number
for
a
certain
length
of
time
and
thus
they
go
round
from
one
to
the
other
if
the
farmers
did
not
pay
three
shillings
in
taxes
out
of
every
six
shillings
that
they
give
in
the
shape
of
wages
they
could
afford
to
give
the
men
four
and
sixpence
in
wages
which
would
be
better
to
the
men
than
the
six
but
as
long
as
this
burden
of
taxes
shall
continue
so
long
the
misery
will
last
and
it
will
go
on
increasing
with
accelerated
pace
the
march
of
circumstances
is
precisely
what
it
was
in
france
just
previous
to
the
french
revolution
if
the
aristocracy
were
wise
they
would
put
a
stop
to
that
march
the
middle
class
are
fast
sinking
down
to
the
state
of
the
lower
class
community
of
between
these
classes
and
that
feeling
an
angry
one
is
what
the
aristocracy
has
to
dread
as
far
as
the
higher
clergy
are
concerned
this
community
of
feeling
is
already
complete
a
short
time
will
extend
the
feeling
to
every
other
branch
and
then
the
hideous
consequences
make
their
appearance
reform
a
radical
reform
of
the
parliament
this
reform
this
reform
which
would
reconcile
the
middle
class
to
the
aristocracy
and
give
renovation
to
that
which
has
now
become
a
mass
of
decay
and
disgust
this
reform
given
with
a
good
grace
and
not
taken
by
force
is
the
only
refuge
for
the
aristocracy
of
this
kingdom
just
as
it
was
in
france
all
the
tricks
of
financiers
have
been
tried
in
vain
and
some
trick
more
pompous
and
foolish
than
the
rest
sir
henry
parnell
trick
perhaps
or
something
equally
foolish
would
blow
the
whole
concern
into
the
air
may
in
tracing
myself
from
leicester
to
this
place
i
begin
at
lutterworth
in
leicestershire
one
of
the
prettiest
country
towns
that
i
ever
saw
that
is
to
say
prettiest
at
this
place
they
have
in
the
church
they
say
the
identical
from
which
wickliffe
preached
this
was
not
his
but
he
was
it
seems
priest
of
this
parish
i
set
off
from
lutterworth
early
on
the
of
april
stopped
to
breakfast
at
birmingham
got
to
wolverhampton
by
two
a
distance
altogether
of
about
miles
and
lectured
at
six
in
the
evening
i
repeated
or
rather
continued
the
lecturing
on
the
and
on
the
of
may
on
the
of
may
went
to
dudley
and
lectured
there
on
the
of
may
at
birmingham
on
the
and
at
shrewsbury
and
on
the
came
here
thus
have
i
come
through
countries
of
corn
and
meat
and
iron
and
coal
and
from
the
banks
of
the
humber
to
those
of
the
severn
i
find
all
the
people
who
do
not
share
in
the
taxes
in
a
state
of
distress
greater
or
less
all
frightened
out
of
trembling
for
the
fate
of
their
children
and
in
the
most
miserable
state
and
as
they
ought
to
be
in
the
of
these
will
i
am
afraid
be
the
at
last
the
farmers
are
cowed
down
the
poorer
they
get
the
more
cowardly
they
are
every
one
of
them
sees
the
cause
of
his
suffering
and
sees
general
ruin
at
hand
but
every
one
hopes
that
by
some
trick
some
act
of
meanness
some
contrivance
shall
so
that
there
is
no
hope
of
any
change
for
the
better
but
from
the
the
farmers
will
sink
to
a
very
low
state
and
thus
the
thing
barring
may
go
on
until
neither
farmer
nor
tradesman
will
see
a
joint
of
meat
on
his
table
once
in
a
quarter
of
a
year
it
appears
likely
to
be
precisely
as
it
was
in
france
it
is
now
just
what
france
was
at
the
close
of
the
reign
of
louis
xv
it
has
been
the
fashion
to
ascribe
the
to
the
writings
of
voltaire
rousseau
diderot
and
others
these
writings
had
at
to
do
with
the
matter
no
at
the
was
produced
by
which
at
last
became
unbearable
by
debts
of
the
state
but
in
fact
by
the
despair
of
the
people
produced
by
the
weight
of
the
taxes
it
is
curious
to
observe
how
ready
the
supporters
of
tyranny
and
taxation
are
to
ascribe
rebellions
and
revolutions
to
disaffected
leaders
and
particularly
to
writers
and
as
these
supporters
of
tyranny
and
taxation
have
had
the
press
at
their
command
have
had
generally
the
absolute
command
of
it
they
have
caused
this
belief
to
go
down
from
generation
to
generation
it
will
not
do
for
them
to
ascribe
revolutions
and
rebellions
to
the
true
cause
because
then
the
rebellions
and
revolutions
would
be
justified
and
it
is
their
object
to
cause
them
to
be
condemned
infinite
delusion
has
prevailed
in
this
country
in
consequence
of
the
efforts
of
which
i
am
now
speaking
voltaire
was
just
as
much
a
cause
of
the
french
revolution
as
i
have
been
the
cause
of
imposing
these
sixty
millions
of
taxes
the
french
revolution
was
produced
by
the
grindings
of
taxation
and
this
i
will
take
an
opportunity
very
soon
of
proving
to
the
conviction
of
every
man
in
the
kingdom
who
chooses
to
read
in
the
iron
country
of
which
wolverhampton
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
central
point
and
where
thousands
and
perhaps
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
people
are
assembled
together
the
or
system
generally
prevails
and
this
is
a
very
remarkable
feature
in
the
state
of
this
country
i
have
made
inquiries
with
regard
to
the
origin
or
etymology
of
this
word
and
could
find
no
one
to
furnish
me
with
the
information
it
is
certainly
like
so
many
other
good
things
to
be
ascribed
to
for
when
i
was
a
recruit
at
chatham
barracks
in
the
year
we
had
brown
bread
served
out
to
us
twice
in
the
week
and
for
what
reason
god
knows
we
used
to
call
it
and
the
sergeants
when
they
called
us
out
to
get
our
bread
used
to
tell
us
to
come
and
get
our
even
the
officers
used
to
call
it
tommy
any
one
that
could
get
white
bread
called
it
bread
but
the
brown
stuff
that
we
got
in
lieu
of
part
of
our
pay
was
called
and
so
we
used
to
call
it
when
we
got
abroad
when
the
soldiers
came
to
have
bread
served
out
to
them
in
the
several
towns
in
england
the
name
of
tommy
went
down
by
tradition
and
doubtless
it
was
taken
up
and
adapted
to
the
truck
system
in
staffordshire
and
elsewhere
now
there
is
nothing
wrong
nothing
wrong
in
this
system
of
barter
barter
is
in
practice
in
some
of
the
happiest
communities
in
the
world
in
the
new
settled
parts
of
the
united
states
of
america
to
which
money
has
scarcely
found
its
way
to
which
articles
of
wearing
apparel
are
brought
from
a
great
distance
where
the
great
and
almost
sole
occupations
are
the
rearing
of
food
the
building
of
houses
and
the
making
of
clothes
barter
is
the
rule
and
money
payment
the
exception
and
this
is
attended
with
no
injury
and
with
very
little
inconvenience
the
bargains
are
made
and
the
accounts
kept
but
the
payments
are
made
in
produce
or
in
goods
the
price
of
these
being
previously
settled
on
the
which
we
call
receives
the
produce
in
exchange
for
his
goods
and
exchanges
that
produce
for
more
goods
and
thus
the
concerns
of
the
community
go
on
every
one
living
in
abundance
and
the
sound
of
misery
never
heard
but
when
this
tommy
system
this
system
of
barter
when
this
makes
its
appearance
where
money
has
for
ages
been
the
medium
of
exchange
and
of
payments
for
labour
when
this
system
makes
its
appearance
in
such
a
state
of
society
there
is
something
wrong
things
are
out
of
joint
and
it
becomes
us
to
inquire
into
the
real
cause
of
its
being
resorted
to
and
it
does
not
become
us
to
join
in
an
outcry
against
the
employers
who
resort
to
it
until
we
be
perfectly
satisfied
that
those
employers
are
guilty
of
oppression
the
manner
of
carrying
on
the
tommy
system
is
this
suppose
there
to
be
a
master
who
employs
a
hundred
men
that
hundred
men
let
us
suppose
to
earn
a
pound
a
week
each
this
is
not
the
case
in
the
but
no
matter
we
can
illustrate
our
meaning
by
one
sum
as
well
as
by
another
these
men
lay
out
weekly
the
whole
of
the
hundred
pounds
in
victuals
drink
clothing
bedding
fuel
and
now
the
master
finding
the
profits
of
his
trade
fall
off
very
much
and
being
at
the
same
time
in
want
of
money
to
pay
the
hundred
pounds
weekly
and
perceiving
that
these
hundred
pounds
are
carried
away
at
once
and
given
to
shopkeepers
of
various
descriptions
to
butchers
bakers
drapers
hatters
shoemakers
and
the
rest
and
knowing
that
on
an
average
these
shopkeepers
must
all
have
a
profit
of
thirty
or
more
he
determines
to
this
thirty
per
cent
to
and
this
is
thirty
pounds
a
week
gained
as
a
which
amounts
to
a
year
he
therefore
sets
up
a
tommy
shop
a
long
place
containing
every
commodity
that
the
workman
can
want
liquor
and
excepted
here
the
workman
takes
out
his
pound
worth
and
his
he
pays
in
truck
if
he
do
not
rent
of
his
master
and
if
he
will
have
liquor
beer
or
gin
or
anything
else
he
must
get
it
by
trucking
with
the
goods
that
he
has
got
at
the
tommy
shop
now
there
is
nothing
essentially
unjust
in
this
there
is
a
little
inconvenience
as
far
as
the
goes
but
not
much
the
tommy
is
easily
turned
into
money
and
if
the
single
saving
man
does
experience
some
trouble
in
the
sale
of
his
goods
that
is
compensated
for
in
the
more
important
case
of
the
married
man
whose
wife
and
children
generally
experience
the
benefit
of
this
payment
in
kind
it
is
to
be
sure
a
sorrowful
reflection
that
such
a
check
upon
the
drinking
propensities
of
the
fathers
should
be
necessary
but
necessity
and
however
sorrowful
the
fact
the
fact
i
am
assured
is
that
thousands
upon
thousands
of
mothers
have
to
bless
this
system
though
it
arises
from
a
loss
of
trade
and
the
poverty
of
the
masters
i
have
often
had
to
observe
on
the
cruel
effects
of
the
suppression
of
markets
and
fairs
and
on
the
consequent
power
of
extortion
possessed
by
the
country
and
what
a
thing
it
is
to
reflect
on
that
these
shopkeepers
have
the
whole
of
the
labouring
men
of
england
constantly
in
their
debt
have
on
an
average
a
mortgage
on
their
wages
to
the
amount
of
five
or
six
weeks
and
make
them
pay
any
price
that
they
choose
to
extort
so
that
in
fact
there
is
a
tommy
system
in
every
village
the
difference
being
that
the
is
the
tommy
man
instead
of
the
farmer
the
only
question
is
in
this
case
of
the
manufacturing
tommy
work
whether
the
master
charges
a
higher
price
than
the
would
charge
and
while
i
have
not
heard
that
the
masters
do
this
i
think
it
improbable
that
they
should
they
must
desire
to
avoid
the
charge
of
such
extortion
and
they
have
little
temptation
to
it
because
they
buy
at
best
hand
and
in
large
quantities
because
they
are
sure
of
their
customers
and
know
to
a
certainty
the
quantity
that
they
want
and
because
the
distribution
of
the
goods
is
a
matter
of
such
perfect
regularity
and
attended
with
so
little
expense
compared
with
the
expenses
of
the
shopkeeper
any
farmer
who
has
a
parcel
of
married
men
working
for
him
might
supply
them
with
meat
for
the
pound
when
the
butcher
must
charge
them
or
lose
by
his
trade
and
to
me
it
has
always
appeared
astonishing
that
farmers
where
they
happen
to
have
the
power
completely
in
their
hands
do
not
compel
their
married
labourers
to
have
a
sufficiency
of
bread
and
meat
for
their
wives
and
children
what
would
be
more
easy
than
to
reckon
what
would
be
necessary
for
fuel
and
clothing
to
pay
that
in
money
once
a
month
or
something
of
that
sort
and
to
pay
the
rest
in
meat
flour
and
malt
i
may
never
occupy
a
farm
again
but
if
i
were
to
do
it
to
any
extent
the
east
and
west
indies
nor
big
brewer
nor
distiller
should
ever
have
one
farthing
out
of
the
produce
of
my
farm
except
he
got
it
through
the
throats
of
those
who
made
the
wearing
apparel
if
i
had
a
village
at
my
command
not
a
should
sing
in
that
village
there
should
be
no
extortioner
under
the
name
of
country
and
no
bloated
fellow
with
red
eyes
unshaven
face
and
till
noon
called
a
publican
and
generally
worthy
of
the
name
of
backs
and
bellies
would
be
my
delight
and
as
to
talking
about
controlling
and
compelling
what
a
controlling
and
compelling
are
there
now
it
is
everlasting
control
and
compulsion
my
bargain
should
be
so
much
in
money
and
so
much
in
bread
meat
and
malt
and
what
is
the
bargain
i
want
to
know
yearly
why
so
much
in
money
and
the
rest
in
bread
meat
beer
lodging
and
fuel
and
does
any
one
affect
to
say
that
this
is
wrong
does
any
one
say
that
it
is
wrong
to
exercise
control
and
compulsion
over
these
servants
such
control
and
compulsion
is
not
only
the
master
right
but
they
are
included
in
his
bounden
it
is
his
duty
to
make
them
rise
early
keep
good
hours
be
industrious
and
careful
be
cleanly
in
their
persons
and
habits
be
civil
in
their
language
these
are
amongst
the
uses
of
the
means
which
god
has
put
into
his
hands
and
are
these
means
to
be
neglected
towards
married
servants
any
more
than
towards
single
ones
even
in
the
and
parts
of
the
united
states
of
america
it
is
the
general
custom
and
a
very
good
custom
it
is
to
pay
the
wages
of
labour
in
money
and
partly
in
and
this
practice
is
extended
to
carpenters
bricklayers
and
other
workmen
about
buildings
and
even
to
tailors
shoemakers
and
weavers
who
go
a
most
excellent
custom
to
to
work
the
bargain
is
so
much
money
that
is
to
say
found
in
food
and
drink
and
sometimes
in
lodging
the
money
then
used
to
be
for
a
common
labourer
in
long
island
at
common
work
not
haying
or
harvesting
three
york
shillings
a
day
and
found
that
is
to
say
three
times
halfpenny
of
our
money
and
three
times
halfpenny
a
day
which
is
eleven
shillings
and
a
week
and
found
this
was
the
wages
of
the
commonest
labourer
at
the
commonest
work
and
the
wages
of
a
good
labourer
now
in
worcestershire
eight
shillings
a
week
and
not
accordingly
they
are
miserably
poor
and
degraded
therefore
there
is
in
this
mode
of
payment
nothing
degrading
but
the
tommy
system
of
staffordshire
and
elsewhere
though
not
unjust
in
itself
indirectly
inflicts
great
injustice
on
the
whole
race
of
who
are
necessary
for
the
distribution
of
commodities
in
great
towns
and
whose
property
is
taken
away
from
them
by
this
species
of
monopoly
which
the
employers
of
great
numbers
of
men
have
been
compelled
to
adopt
for
their
own
safety
it
is
not
the
fault
of
the
masters
who
can
have
no
pleasure
in
making
profit
in
this
way
it
is
the
fault
of
the
taxes
which
by
lowering
the
price
of
their
goods
have
compelled
them
to
resort
to
this
means
of
diminishing
their
expenses
or
to
quit
their
business
altogether
which
a
great
part
of
them
can
not
do
without
being
left
without
a
penny
and
if
a
law
could
be
passed
and
enforced
which
it
can
not
to
put
an
end
to
the
tommy
system
the
consequence
would
be
that
instead
of
a
fourth
part
of
the
furnaces
being
let
out
of
blast
in
this
neighbourhood
would
be
let
out
of
blast
and
additional
thousands
of
poor
creatures
would
be
left
solely
dependent
on
parochial
relief
a
view
of
the
situation
of
things
at
shrewsbury
will
lead
us
in
a
minute
to
the
real
cause
of
the
tommy
system
shrewsbury
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
spots
that
man
ever
beheld
it
is
the
capital
of
the
county
of
salop
and
salop
appears
to
have
been
the
original
name
of
the
town
itself
it
is
curiously
enclosed
by
the
river
severn
which
is
here
large
and
fine
and
which
in
the
form
of
a
completely
surrounds
it
leaving
of
the
whole
of
the
two
miles
round
only
one
little
place
whereon
to
pass
in
and
out
on
land
there
are
two
bridges
one
on
the
east
and
the
other
on
the
west
the
former
called
the
english
and
the
other
the
welsh
bridge
the
environs
of
this
town
especially
on
the
welsh
side
are
the
most
beautiful
that
can
be
conceived
the
town
lies
in
the
midst
of
a
fine
agricultural
country
of
which
it
is
the
great
and
almost
only
mart
hither
come
the
farmers
to
sell
their
produce
and
hence
they
take
in
exchange
their
groceries
their
clothing
and
all
the
materials
for
their
implements
and
the
domestic
conveniences
it
was
when
i
arrived
at
shrewsbury
everything
was
on
the
decline
cheese
which
four
years
ago
sold
at
sixty
shillings
the
pounds
would
not
bring
forty
i
took
particular
pains
to
ascertain
the
fact
with
regard
to
the
cheese
which
is
a
great
article
here
i
was
assured
that
in
general
did
not
now
sell
half
the
quantity
of
goods
in
a
month
that
they
did
in
that
space
of
time
four
or
five
years
ago
the
were
not
selling
a
of
what
they
used
to
sell
five
years
ago
now
it
is
impossible
to
believe
that
a
somewhat
similar
falling
off
in
the
sale
of
iron
must
not
have
taken
place
all
over
the
kingdom
and
need
we
then
wonder
that
the
iron
in
staffordshire
has
fallen
within
these
five
years
from
thirteen
pounds
to
five
pounds
a
ton
or
perhaps
a
great
deal
more
and
need
we
wonder
that
the
who
have
the
same
rent
and
taxes
to
pay
that
they
had
to
pay
before
have
resorted
to
the
tommy
system
in
order
to
assist
in
saving
themselves
from
ruin
here
is
the
real
cause
of
the
tommy
system
and
if
littleton
really
wishes
to
put
an
end
to
it
let
him
prevail
upon
the
parliament
to
take
off
taxes
to
the
amount
of
forty
millions
a
year
another
article
had
experienced
a
still
greater
falling
off
at
shrewsbury
i
mean
the
article
of
of
which
there
has
been
a
falling
off
of
the
sacks
are
made
by
weavers
in
the
north
and
need
we
wonder
then
at
the
low
wages
of
those
industrious
people
whom
i
used
to
see
weaving
sacks
in
the
miserable
cellars
at
preston
here
is
the
true
cause
of
the
tommy
system
and
of
all
the
other
evils
which
disturb
and
afflict
the
country
it
is
a
great
country
an
immense
mass
of
industry
and
resources
of
all
sorts
a
prodigious
mass
of
enterprise
and
capital
diminishing
and
dispersing
the
enormous
taxes
with
the
which
those
taxes
have
engendered
are
driving
skill
and
wealth
out
of
the
country
in
all
directions
are
causing
to
make
france
and
particularly
belgium
blaze
with
furnaces
in
the
lieu
of
those
which
have
been
extinguished
here
and
that
have
established
furnaces
and
in
abundance
these
same
taxes
and
this
same
are
sending
the
long
wool
from
lincolnshire
to
france
there
to
be
made
into
those
blankets
which
for
ages
were
to
be
obtained
nowhere
but
in
england
this
is
the
true
state
of
the
country
and
here
are
the
true
causes
of
that
state
and
all
that
the
corrupt
writers
and
speakers
say
about
and
and
about
all
the
rest
of
their
shuffling
excuses
is
a
heap
of
nonsense
and
of
lies
i
can
not
quit
shrewsbury
without
expressing
the
great
satisfaction
that
i
derived
from
my
visit
to
that
place
it
is
the
only
town
into
which
i
have
gone
in
all
england
without
knowing
beforehand
something
of
some
person
in
it
i
could
find
out
no
person
that
took
the
register
and
could
discover
but
one
person
who
took
the
to
young
the
number
of
my
auditors
was
expected
to
be
so
small
that
i
doubled
the
price
of
admission
in
order
to
pay
the
expense
of
the
room
to
my
great
surprise
i
had
a
room
full
of
gentlemen
at
the
request
of
some
of
whom
i
repeated
the
dose
the
next
night
and
if
my
audience
were
as
well
pleased
with
me
as
i
was
with
them
their
pleasure
must
have
been
great
indeed
i
saw
not
one
single
person
in
the
place
that
i
had
ever
seen
before
yet
i
never
had
more
cordial
shakes
by
the
hand
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
not
more
at
manchester
oldham
rochdale
halifax
leeds
or
nottingham
or
even
hull
i
was
particularly
pleased
with
the
conduct
of
the
gentlemen
at
shrewsbury
and
especially
when
i
asked
them
whether
they
were
prepared
to
act
upon
the
insolent
doctrine
of
huskisson
and
quietly
submit
to
this
state
of
things
the
present
tour
in
the
west
july
just
as
i
was
closing
my
third
lecture
on
saturday
night
at
bristol
to
a
numerous
and
most
respectable
audience
the
news
of
the
above
event
the
death
of
george
iv
arrived
i
had
advertised
and
made
all
the
preparations
for
lecturing
at
bath
on
monday
tuesday
and
wednesday
but
under
the
circumstances
i
thought
it
would
not
be
proper
to
proceed
thither
for
that
purpose
until
after
the
burial
of
the
king
when
that
has
taken
place
i
shall
as
soon
as
may
be
return
to
bath
taking
hertfordshire
and
buckinghamshire
in
my
way
from
bath
through
somerset
devon
and
into
cornwall
and
back
through
dorset
south
wilts
hants
sussex
kent
and
then
go
into
essex
and
last
of
all
into
my
native
county
of
surrey
i
shall
then
have
seen
all
england
with
my
own
eyes
except
rutland
westmoreland
durham
cumberland
and
northumberland
and
these
if
i
have
life
and
health
till
next
spring
i
shall
see
in
my
way
to
scotland
but
never
shall
i
see
another
place
to
interest
me
and
so
pleasing
to
me
as
bristol
and
its
environs
taking
the
whole
together
a
good
and
solid
and
wealthy
city
a
people
of
plain
and
good
manners
private
virtue
and
public
spirit
united
no
empty
noise
no
insolence
no
flattery
men
very
much
like
the
yorkers
and
lancastrians
and
as
to
the
seat
of
the
city
and
its
environs
it
surpasses
all
that
i
ever
saw
a
great
commercial
city
in
the
midst
of
meadows
and
woods
and
the
ships
coming
into
the
centre
of
it
miles
from
anything
like
sea
up
a
narrow
river
and
passing
between
two
clefts
of
a
rock
probably
a
hundred
feet
high
so
that
from
the
top
of
these
clefts
you
upon
the
gallant
masts
of
lofty
ships
that
are
gliding
along
progress
in
the
north
september
from
bolton
in
lancashire
i
came
through
bury
and
rochdale
to
todmorden
on
the
evening
of
tuesday
the
september
i
have
formerly
described
the
valley
of
todmorden
as
the
most
curious
and
romantic
that
was
ever
seen
and
where
the
water
and
the
coal
seemed
to
be
engaged
in
a
struggle
for
getting
foremost
in
point
of
utility
to
man
on
the
i
staid
all
day
at
todmorden
to
write
and
to
sleep
on
the
i
set
off
for
leeds
by
the
stage
coach
through
halifax
and
bradford
and
as
to
certainly
the
poorest
country
that
i
have
ever
set
my
eyes
on
except
that
miserable
where
there
are
the
townships
of
horton
and
of
wilmot
and
whither
the
sensible
suckling
statesman
lord
howick
is
wanting
to
send
english
country
girls
lest
they
should
breed
if
they
stay
in
england
this
country
from
todmorden
to
leeds
is
however
covered
over
with
population
and
the
two
towns
of
halifax
and
bradford
are
exceedingly
populous
there
appears
to
be
nothing
produced
by
the
earth
but
the
natural
grass
of
the
country
which
however
is
not
bad
the
soil
is
a
sort
of
stiffish
stuff
lying
about
a
foot
thick
upon
a
bed
of
rocky
stone
lying
upon
solid
rock
beneath
the
grass
does
not
seem
to
burn
here
nor
is
it
bad
in
quality
and
all
the
grass
appears
to
be
wanted
to
rear
milk
for
this
immense
population
that
absolutely
covers
the
whole
face
of
the
country
the
only
grain
crops
that
i
saw
were
those
of
very
miserable
oats
some
of
which
were
cut
and
carried
some
standing
in
the
sheaves
not
being
more
than
about
a
foot
and
a
half
long
some
still
standing
and
some
yet
the
land
is
very
high
from
halifax
to
bradford
and
proportionably
cold
here
are
some
of
those
yorkshire
hills
that
they
see
from
lancashire
and
cheshire
i
got
to
leeds
about
four
and
went
to
bed
at
eight
precisely
at
five
in
the
morning
of
the
i
came
off
by
the
coach
to
newcastle
through
harrowgate
ripon
darlington
and
durham
as
i
never
was
in
this
part
of
the
country
before
and
can
therefore
never
have
described
it
upon
any
former
occasion
i
shall
say
rather
more
about
it
now
than
i
otherwise
should
do
having
heard
and
read
so
much
about
the
northern
harvest
about
the
durham
ploughs
and
the
northumberland
system
of
husbandry
what
was
my
surprise
at
finding
which
i
verily
believe
to
be
the
fact
that
there
is
not
as
much
corn
grown
in
the
of
yorkshire
which
begins
at
ripon
and
in
the
whole
county
of
durham
as
is
grown
in
the
isle
of
wight
alone
a
very
small
part
comparatively
speaking
is
land
and
all
the
outward
appearances
show
that
that
which
is
arable
was
formerly
pasture
between
durham
and
newcastle
there
is
a
pretty
general
division
of
the
land
into
grass
fields
and
corn
fields
but
even
here
the
absence
of
the
absence
of
barns
and
of
labourers
cottages
clearly
show
that
agriculture
is
a
sort
of
novelty
and
that
nearly
all
was
pasturage
not
many
years
ago
or
at
any
rate
only
so
much
of
the
land
was
cultivated
as
was
necessary
to
furnish
straw
for
the
horses
kept
for
other
purposes
than
those
of
agriculture
and
oats
for
those
horses
and
bread
corn
sufficient
for
the
graziers
and
their
people
all
along
the
road
from
leeds
to
durham
i
saw
hardly
any
wheat
at
all
or
any
wheat
stubble
no
barley
the
chief
crops
being
oats
and
beans
mixed
with
peas
these
everywhere
appeared
to
be
what
we
should
deem
most
miserable
crops
the
oats
tied
up
in
sheaves
or
yet
uncut
were
scarcely
ever
more
than
two
feet
and
a
half
long
the
beans
were
about
the
same
height
and
in
both
cases
the
land
so
full
of
grass
as
to
appear
to
be
after
the
oats
and
the
beans
were
cut
the
land
appears
to
be
divided
into
very
extensive
farms
the
corn
when
cut
you
see
put
up
into
little
stacks
of
a
circular
form
each
containing
about
of
our
southern
of
sheaves
which
stacks
are
put
up
round
about
the
stone
house
and
the
buildings
of
the
farmer
how
they
thrash
them
out
i
do
not
know
for
i
could
see
nothing
resembling
a
barn
or
a
barn
door
by
the
corn
being
put
into
such
small
stacks
i
should
suppose
the
thrashing
places
to
be
very
small
and
capable
of
holding
only
one
stack
at
a
time
i
have
many
times
seen
one
single
rick
containing
a
greater
quantity
of
sheaves
than
fifteen
or
twenty
of
these
stacks
and
i
have
seen
more
than
twenty
stacks
each
containing
a
number
of
sheaves
equal
to
at
least
fifteen
of
these
stacks
i
have
seen
more
than
twenty
of
these
large
stacks
standing
at
one
and
the
same
time
in
one
single
homestead
in
wiltshire
i
should
not
at
all
wonder
if
tom
baring
farmers
at
micheldever
had
a
greater
bulk
of
standing
now
than
any
one
would
be
able
to
find
of
that
grain
especially
in
the
whole
of
the
of
yorkshire
and
in
one
half
of
durham
but
this
by
no
means
implies
that
these
are
beggarly
counties
even
exclusive
of
their
waters
coals
and
mines
they
are
not
counties
they
are
not
counties
for
the
producing
of
bread
but
they
are
counties
made
for
the
express
purpose
of
producing
meat
in
which
respect
they
excel
the
southern
counties
in
a
degree
beyond
all
comparison
i
have
just
spoken
of
the
of
that
are
everywhere
seen
after
the
oats
and
the
beans
have
been
out
grass
is
the
natural
produce
of
this
land
which
seems
to
have
been
made
on
purpose
to
produce
it
and
we
are
not
to
call
land
because
it
will
produce
nothing
but
meat
the
size
and
shape
of
the
fields
the
sort
of
fences
the
absence
of
all
homesteads
and
labourers
cottages
the
thinness
of
the
country
churches
everything
shows
that
this
was
always
a
country
purely
of
pasturage
it
is
curious
that
belonging
to
every
farm
there
appears
to
be
a
large
quantity
of
turnips
they
are
sowed
in
drills
cultivated
between
beautifully
clean
very
large
in
the
bulb
even
now
and
apparently
having
been
sowed
early
in
june
if
not
in
may
they
are
generally
the
white
globe
turnip
here
and
there
a
field
of
the
swedish
kind
these
turnips
are
not
fed
off
by
sheep
and
followed
by
crops
of
barley
and
clover
as
in
the
south
but
are
raised
i
suppose
for
the
purpose
of
being
carried
in
and
used
in
the
feeding
of
oxen
which
have
come
off
the
grass
lands
in
october
and
november
these
turnip
lands
seem
to
take
all
the
manure
of
the
farm
and
as
the
reader
will
perceive
they
are
merely
an
adjunct
to
the
pasturage
serving
during
the
winter
instead
of
hay
wherewith
to
feed
the
cattle
of
various
descriptions
this
then
is
not
a
country
of
farmers
but
a
country
of
graziers
a
country
of
pasture
and
not
a
country
of
the
plough
and
those
who
formerly
managed
the
land
here
were
not
husbandmen
but
herdsmen
fortescue
was
i
dare
say
a
native
of
this
country
for
he
describes
england
as
a
country
of
shepherds
and
of
herdsmen
not
working
so
very
hard
as
the
people
of
france
did
having
more
leisure
for
contemplation
and
therefore
more
likely
to
form
a
just
estimate
of
their
rights
and
duties
and
he
describes
them
as
having
at
all
times
in
their
houses
plenty
of
flesh
to
eat
and
plenty
of
woollen
to
wear
augustine
in
writing
to
the
pope
an
account
of
the
character
and
conduct
of
his
converts
in
england
told
him
that
he
found
the
english
an
exceedingly
good
and
generous
people
but
they
had
one
fault
their
fondness
for
was
so
great
and
their
resolution
to
have
it
so
determined
that
he
could
not
get
them
to
abstain
from
it
even
on
the
and
that
he
was
greatly
afraid
that
they
would
return
to
their
state
of
horrible
heathenism
rather
than
submit
to
the
discipline
of
the
church
in
this
respect
the
pope
who
had
more
sense
than
the
greater
part
of
bishops
have
ever
had
wrote
for
answer
keep
them
within
the
pale
of
the
church
at
any
rate
even
if
they
slaughter
their
oxen
in
the
churchyards
let
them
make
shambles
of
the
churches
rather
than
suffer
the
devil
to
carry
away
their
souls
the
taste
of
our
fathers
was
by
no
means
for
the
potato
for
the
nice
potato
the
pope
himself
would
not
have
been
able
to
induce
them
to
carry
cold
potatoes
in
their
bags
to
the
as
was
in
evidence
before
the
special
commissions
proved
to
have
been
the
common
practice
in
hampshire
and
wiltshire
and
which
had
been
before
proved
by
evidence
taken
by
unfeeling
committees
of
the
boroughmonger
house
of
commons
faith
these
old
papas
of
ours
would
have
burnt
up
not
only
the
stacks
but
the
ground
itself
rather
than
have
lived
upon
miserable
roots
while
those
who
raised
none
of
the
food
were
eating
up
all
the
bread
and
the
meat
brougham
and
birkbeck
and
the
rest
of
the
malthusian
crew
are
constantly
at
work
preaching
to
the
hungry
and
to
be
sure
they
themselves
however
are
not
content
to
be
hungry
and
naked
amongst
other
things
they
tell
the
that
the
especially
in
the
north
used
to
have
no
bread
except
such
as
was
made
of
oats
and
of
barley
that
was
better
than
potatoes
even
the
nice
mealy
ones
especially
when
carried
cold
to
the
field
in
a
bag
but
these
literary
impostors
these
deluders
as
far
as
they
are
able
to
delude
these
vagabond
authors
who
thus
write
and
publish
for
the
purpose
of
persuading
the
to
be
quiet
while
they
sack
luxuries
and
riches
out
of
the
fruit
of
their
toil
these
literary
impostors
take
care
not
to
tell
the
people
that
these
oatcakes
and
this
were
always
associated
with
great
lumps
of
they
forget
to
tell
them
this
or
rather
these
perverse
and
perverting
literary
impostors
suppress
the
facts
for
reasons
far
too
manifest
to
need
stating
the
cattle
here
are
the
most
beautiful
by
far
that
i
ever
saw
the
sheep
are
very
handsome
but
the
horned
cattle
are
the
prettiest
creatures
that
my
eyes
ever
beheld
my
sons
will
recollect
that
when
they
were
little
boys
i
took
them
to
see
the
durham
ox
of
which
they
drew
the
picture
i
dare
say
a
hundred
times
that
was
upon
a
large
scale
to
be
sure
the
model
of
all
these
beautiful
cattle
short
horns
strait
back
a
taper
neck
very
small
in
proportion
where
it
joins
on
the
small
and
handsome
head
deep
dewlap
in
the
legs
tail
slender
a
great
part
of
them
are
white
or
approaching
very
nearly
to
white
they
all
appear
to
be
half
fat
cows
and
oxen
and
all
and
the
meat
from
them
is
said
to
be
and
i
believe
it
is
as
fine
as
that
from
lincolnshire
herefordshire
romney
marsh
or
pevensey
level
and
i
am
ready
at
any
time
to
swear
if
need
be
that
one
pound
of
it
fed
upon
this
grass
is
worth
more
to
me
at
least
than
any
ten
pounds
or
twenty
pounds
fed
upon
or
the
stinking
stuff
of
distilleries
aye
or
even
upon
turnips
this
is
all
even
from
staffordshire
to
this
point
in
its
very
nature
it
produces
grass
that
fattens
the
little
that
there
is
even
in
lancashire
and
the
of
yorkshire
produces
grass
that
would
fatten
an
ox
though
the
land
be
upon
the
tops
of
hills
everywhere
where
there
is
a
sufficiency
of
grass
it
will
fatten
an
ox
and
well
do
we
southern
people
know
that
except
in
mere
vales
and
meadows
we
have
no
land
that
will
do
this
we
know
that
we
might
put
an
ox
up
to
his
eyes
in
our
grass
and
that
it
would
only
just
keep
him
from
growing
worse
we
know
that
we
are
obliged
to
have
turnips
and
meal
and
cabbages
and
parsnips
and
potatoes
and
then
with
some
of
our
hungry
hay
for
them
to
their
teeth
we
make
shift
to
put
fat
upon
an
ox
yet
so
much
are
we
like
the
beasts
which
in
the
fable
came
before
jupiter
to
ask
him
to
endow
them
with
faculties
incompatible
with
their
divers
frames
and
divers
degrees
of
strength
that
we
in
this
age
of
improvements
are
always
hankering
after
laying
fields
down
in
pasture
in
the
south
while
these
fellows
in
the
north
as
if
resolved
to
rival
us
in
improvement
and
perverseness
must
needs
break
up
their
and
proclaim
defiance
to
the
will
of
providence
and
instead
of
rich
pasture
present
to
the
eye
of
the
traveller
starveling
oats
and
peas
some
of
them
in
blossom
in
the
last
week
of
september
the
land
itself
the
earth
of
its
own
accord
as
if
resolved
to
vindicate
the
decrees
of
its
maker
sends
up
grass
under
these
miserable
crops
as
if
to
punish
them
for
their
intrusion
and
when
the
crops
are
off
there
comes
a
pasture
at
any
rate
in
which
the
grass
like
that
of
herefordshire
and
lincolnshire
is
not
as
it
is
in
our
southern
countries
mixed
with
weeds
but
standing
upon
the
ground
as
thick
as
the
earth
can
bear
it
and
fattening
everything
that
eats
of
it
it
forbids
the
perverse
occupier
to
tear
it
to
pieces
such
is
the
land
of
this
country
all
to
the
north
of
cheshire
at
any
rate
leaving
out
the
of
yorkshire
and
lincolnshire
which
are
adapted
for
corn
in
some
spots
and
for
cattle
in
others
these
yorkshire
and
durham
cows
are
to
be
seen
in
great
numbers
in
and
about
london
where
they
are
used
for
the
purpose
of
giving
milk
of
which
i
suppose
they
give
great
quantities
but
it
is
always
an
observation
that
if
you
have
these
cows
you
must
them
exceedingly
and
this
is
very
true
for
upon
the
food
which
does
very
well
for
the
common
cows
of
hampshire
and
surrey
they
would
dwindle
away
directly
and
be
good
for
nothing
at
all
and
these
sheep
which
are
as
beautiful
as
even
imagination
could
make
them
so
round
and
so
loaded
with
flesh
would
actually
perish
upon
those
downs
and
in
those
folds
where
our
innumerable
flocks
not
only
live
but
fatten
so
well
and
with
such
facility
are
made
to
produce
us
such
quantities
of
fine
mutton
and
such
bales
of
fine
wool
there
seems
to
be
something
in
the
soil
and
climate
and
particularly
in
the
soil
to
create
everywhere
a
sort
of
cattle
and
of
sheep
fitted
to
it
dorsetshire
and
somersetshire
have
sheep
different
from
all
others
and
the
nature
of
which
it
is
to
have
their
lambs
in
the
fall
instead
of
having
them
in
the
spring
i
remember
when
i
was
amongst
the
villages
on
the
in
gloucestershire
they
showed
me
their
sheep
in
several
places
which
are
a
stout
sheep
they
told
me
that
many
attempts
had
been
made
to
cross
them
with
the
leicester
breed
but
that
it
had
never
succeeded
and
that
the
race
always
got
back
to
the
cotswold
breed
immediately
before
closing
these
rural
remarks
i
can
not
help
calling
to
the
mind
of
the
reader
an
observation
of
lord
john
scott
eldon
who
at
a
time
when
there
was
a
great
complaint
about
agricultural
distress
and
about
the
fearful
increase
of
the
said
that
there
was
no
such
distress
and
no
such
increase
of
the
and
so
said
my
dignitary
black
at
the
same
time
and
this
this
wise
lord
and
this
not
less
wise
dignitary
of
mine
ascribed
to
the
bad
practice
of
the
farmers
o
the
sooth
paying
the
labourers
their
wages
out
of
the
which
was
not
the
practice
in
the
north
i
thought
that
they
were
telling
what
the
children
call
but
i
now
find
that
these
observations
of
theirs
arose
purely
from
that
want
of
knowledge
of
the
country
which
was
and
is
common
to
them
both
why
lord
john
there
are
no
such
persons
here
as
we
call
farmers
and
no
such
persons
as
we
call
from
cheshire
to
newcastle
i
have
never
seen
single
labourer
cottage
by
the
side
of
the
oh
lord
if
the
good
people
of
this
country
could
but
see
the
endless
strings
of
cottages
and
of
the
labourers
of
kent
sussex
surrey
and
hampshire
if
they
could
go
down
the
vale
of
the
avon
in
wiltshire
from
marlborough
forest
to
the
city
of
salisbury
and
there
see
parish
churches
in
a
distance
of
thirty
miles
if
they
could
go
up
from
that
city
of
salisbury
up
the
valley
of
wylly
to
warminster
and
there
see
churches
in
the
space
of
miles
if
they
could
go
upon
the
top
of
the
down
as
i
did
not
far
i
think
it
was
from
mary
cotford
and
there
have
under
the
eye
in
the
valley
below
parish
churches
within
the
distance
of
eight
see
the
downs
covered
with
innumerable
flocks
of
sheep
water
meadows
running
down
the
middle
of
the
valley
while
the
sides
rising
from
it
were
covered
with
corn
sometimes
a
hundred
acres
of
wheat
in
one
single
piece
while
the
were
still
well
stored
from
the
previous
harvest
if
john
scott
eldon
countrymen
could
behold
those
things
their
would
soon
discover
why
should
have
increased
in
the
south
and
not
in
the
north
and
though
their
liberality
would
suggest
an
apology
for
my
dignitary
black
who
was
freighted
to
london
in
a
smack
and
has
ever
since
been
impounded
in
the
strand
relieved
now
and
then
by
an
excursion
to
blackheath
or
clapham
common
to
find
an
apology
for
their
countryman
lord
john
would
be
putting
their
liberality
to
an
uncommonly
severe
test
for
he
be
it
known
to
them
has
chosen
his
country
abode
not
in
the
strand
like
my
dignitary
black
nor
in
his
native
regions
in
the
north
but
has
in
the
beautiful
county
of
dorset
amidst
valleys
and
downs
precisely
like
those
of
wiltshire
got
as
near
to
the
sun
as
he
could
possibly
get
and
there
from
the
top
of
his
mansion
he
can
see
a
score
of
churches
and
from
his
lofty
and
downs
and
from
his
fat
valleys
beneath
he
annually
sends
his
flocks
of
ewes
to
appleshaw
fair
thence
to
be
sold
to
all
the
southern
parts
of
the
kingdom
having
marked
upon
their
beautiful
wool
and
like
the
two
factions
at
maidstone
all
tarred
with
the
same
brush
it
is
curious
too
notwithstanding
the
old
maxim
that
we
all
try
to
get
as
nearly
as
possible
in
our
old
age
to
the
spot
whence
we
first
sprang
lord
john
brother
william
who
has
some
title
that
i
have
forgotten
has
taken
up
his
quarters
on
the
healthy
and
i
say
beautiful
cotswold
of
gloucestershire
where
in
going
in
a
postchaise
from
to
cirencester
i
thought
i
should
never
get
by
the
wall
of
his
park
and
i
exclaimed
to
dean
who
was
along
with
me
curse
this
northumbrian
son
he
has
got
one
half
of
the
county
and
then
all
the
way
to
cirencester
i
was
explaining
to
dean
the
man
had
got
his
at
which
dean
who
is
a
roman
catholic
seemed
to
me
to
be
ready
to
cross
himself
several
times
no
there
is
no
apology
for
lord
john
observations
on
the
difference
between
the
of
the
south
and
the
north
to
go
from
london
to
his
he
must
go
across
surrey
and
hampshire
along
one
of
the
vales
of
wiltshire
and
one
of
the
vales
of
dorsetshire
in
which
latter
county
he
has
many
a
time
seen
in
one
single
large
field
hundred
stacks
made
in
the
field
in
order
that
the
corn
may
get
quite
dry
before
it
be
put
into
great
stacks
he
has
many
a
time
seen
on
one
farm
two
or
three
hundred
of
these
each
of
which
was
very
nearly
as
big
as
the
stacks
which
you
see
in
the
of
the
north
riding
of
yorkshire
and
of
durham
where
a
large
farm
seldom
produces
more
than
ten
or
a
dozen
of
these
stacks
and
where
the
farmer
property
consists
of
his
cattle
and
sheep
and
where
little
very
little
agricultural
labour
is
wanted
lord
john
ought
to
have
known
the
cause
of
the
great
difference
and
not
to
have
suffered
such
nonsense
to
come
out
of
a
head
covered
with
so
very
large
a
wig
i
looked
with
particular
care
on
the
sides
of
the
road
all
the
way
through
yorkshire
and
durham
the
distance
altogether
from
oldham
in
lancashire
to
is
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
and
leaving
out
the
towns
i
did
not
see
so
many
churches
as
are
to
be
seen
in
any
twenty
miles
of
any
of
the
valleys
of
wiltshire
all
these
things
prove
that
these
are
by
nature
counties
of
pasturage
and
that
they
were
formerly
used
solely
for
that
purpose
it
is
curious
that
there
are
none
of
those
lands
here
which
we
call
meadows
the
rivers
run
in
and
have
generally
very
steep
sides
no
little
rivulets
and
occasional
overflowings
that
make
the
meadows
in
the
south
which
are
so
very
beautiful
but
the
grass
in
which
is
not
of
the
rich
nature
that
the
grass
is
in
these
counties
in
the
north
it
will
produce
milk
enough
but
it
will
not
produce
beef
it
is
hard
to
say
which
part
of
the
country
is
the
most
valuable
gift
of
god
but
every
one
must
see
how
perverse
and
injurious
it
is
to
endeavour
to
produce
in
the
one
that
which
nature
has
intended
to
confine
to
the
other
after
all
the
unnatural
efforts
that
have
been
made
here
to
ape
the
farming
of
norfolk
and
suffolk
it
is
only
at
as
stupid
and
loyal
parents
used
to
set
their
children
play
at
soldiers
during
the
last
if
any
of
these
sensible
men
of
newcastle
were
to
see
the
farming
in
the
south
downs
and
to
see
as
i
saw
in
the
month
of
july
last
four
teams
of
large
oxen
six
in
a
team
all
ploughing
in
one
field
in
preparation
for
wheat
and
several
pairs
of
horses
in
the
same
field
dragging
harrowing
and
rolling
and
had
seen
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
from
five
to
six
quarters
of
wheat
standing
upon
the
acre
and
from
nine
to
ten
quarters
of
oats
standing
alongside
of
it
each
of
the
two
fields
from
fifty
to
a
hundred
statute
acres
if
any
of
these
sensible
men
of
newcastle
could
see
these
things
they
would
laugh
at
the
childish
work
that
they
see
going
on
here
under
the
name
of
farming
the
very
sight
would
make
them
feel
how
imperious
is
the
duty
on
the
to
prevent
distress
from
visiting
the
fields
and
to
take
care
that
those
whose
labour
produced
all
the
food
and
all
the
raiment
shall
not
be
fed
upon
potatoes
and
covered
with
rags
contemplating
the
important
effects
of
their
labour
each
man
of
them
could
say
as
i
said
when
this
mean
and
savage
faction
had
me
at
my
trial
i
would
see
all
these
labourers
hanged
and
be
hanged
along
with
them
rather
than
see
them
live
upon
potatoes
september
since
writing
the
above
i
have
had
an
opportunity
of
receiving
information
from
a
very
intelligent
gentleman
of
this
county
who
tells
me
that
in
northumberland
there
are
some
lands
which
bear
very
heavy
crops
of
wheat
that
the
agriculture
in
this
county
is
a
great
deal
better
than
it
is
farther
south
that
however
it
was
a
most
lamentable
thing
that
the
price
of
corn
tempted
so
many
men
to
break
up
these
fine
pastures
that
the
turf
thus
destroyed
can
not
be
restored
probably
in
a
whole
century
that
the
land
does
not
now
with
present
prices
yield
a
clear
profit
anything
like
what
it
would
have
yielded
in
the
pasture
and
that
thus
was
destroyed
the
with
the
golden
just
so
was
it
with
regard
to
the
in
the
south
and
the
west
of
england
where
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
acres
where
the
turf
was
the
finest
in
the
world
broken
up
for
the
sake
of
the
prices
but
now
left
to
be
and
which
will
not
be
for
more
than
a
century
to
come
thus
did
this
accursed
cause
even
the
fruitful
qualities
of
the
earth
to
be
anticipated
and
thus
was
the
soil
made
than
it
was
before
the
accursed
invention
appeared
this
gentleman
told
me
that
this
breaking
up
of
the
in
this
country
had
made
the
land
though
covered
again
with
artificial
grasses
unhealthy
for
sheep
and
he
gave
as
an
instance
the
facts
that
three
farmers
purchased
a
hundred
and
fifty
sheep
each
out
of
the
same
flock
that
two
of
them
who
put
their
sheep
upon
these
recently
lands
lost
their
whole
flocks
by
the
rot
with
the
exception
of
four
in
the
one
case
and
four
in
the
other
out
of
the
three
hundred
and
that
the
third
farmer
who
put
his
sheep
upon
the
old
pastures
and
kept
them
there
lost
not
a
single
sheep
out
of
the
hundred
and
fifty
these
ever
accursed
are
amongst
thy
destructive
effects
i
shall
now
laying
aside
for
the
present
these
rural
affairs
turn
to
the
politics
of
this
fine
opulent
solid
beautiful
and
important
town
but
as
this
would
compel
me
to
speak
of
particular
transactions
and
particular
persons
and
as
this
will
come
back
to
newcastle
before
i
am
likely
to
quit
it
the
reader
will
see
reasons
quite
sufficient
for
my
refraining
to
go
into
matters
of
this
sort
until
the
next
which
will
in
all
probability
be
dated
from
edinburgh
while
at
manchester
i
received
an
invitation
to
lodge
while
here
at
the
house
of
a
friend
of
whom
i
shall
have
to
speak
more
fully
hereafter
but
every
demonstration
of
respect
and
kindness
met
me
at
the
door
of
the
coach
in
which
i
came
from
leeds
on
friday
the
september
in
the
early
part
of
saturday
the
a
deputation
waited
upon
me
with
let
the
readers
in
my
native
county
and
parish
remember
that
i
am
now
at
the
end
of
thirty
years
of
calumnies
poured
out
incessantly
upon
me
from
the
poisonous
mouths
and
pens
of
three
hundred
mercenary
villains
called
newspaper
editors
and
reporters
that
i
have
written
and
published
more
than
a
hundred
volumes
in
those
thirty
years
and
that
more
than
a
thousand
volumes
chiefly
paid
for
out
of
the
taxes
have
been
written
and
published
for
the
sole
purpose
of
impeding
the
progress
of
those
truths
that
dropped
from
my
pen
that
my
whole
life
has
been
a
life
of
sobriety
and
labour
that
i
have
invariably
shown
that
i
loved
and
honoured
my
country
and
that
i
preferred
its
greatness
and
happiness
far
beyond
my
own
that
at
four
distinct
periods
i
might
have
rolled
in
wealth
derived
from
the
public
money
which
i
always
refused
on
any
account
to
touch
that
for
having
thwarted
this
government
in
its
wastefulness
of
the
public
resources
and
particularly
for
my
endeavours
to
produce
that
reform
of
the
parliament
which
the
government
itself
has
at
last
been
compelled
to
resort
to
that
for
having
acted
this
zealous
and
virtuous
part
i
have
been
twice
stripped
of
all
my
earnings
by
the
acts
of
this
government
once
lodged
in
a
felon
jail
for
two
years
and
once
driven
into
exile
for
two
years
and
a
half
and
that
after
all
here
i
am
on
a
spot
within
a
hundred
miles
of
which
i
never
was
before
in
my
life
and
here
i
am
receiving
the
unsolicited
applause
of
men
amongst
the
most
intelligent
in
the
whole
kingdom
and
the
names
of
some
of
whom
have
been
pronounced
accompanied
with
admiration
even
to
the
southernmost
edge
of
the
kingdom
i
left
morpeth
this
morning
pretty
early
to
come
to
this
town
which
lies
on
the
banks
of
the
tyne
at
miles
distant
from
morpeth
and
at
twenty
distant
from
newcastle
morpeth
is
a
great
for
cattle
especially
it
is
a
solid
old
town
but
it
has
the
disgrace
of
seeing
an
enormous
new
jail
rising
up
in
it
from
cathedrals
and
monasteries
we
are
come
to
be
proud
of
our
jails
which
are
built
in
the
grandest
style
and
seemingly
as
if
to
imitate
the
gothic
architecture
from
morpeth
to
within
about
four
miles
of
hexham
the
land
is
but
very
indifferent
the
farms
of
an
enormous
extent
i
saw
in
one
place
more
than
a
hundred
in
one
yard
each
having
from
six
to
seven
surrey
of
sheaves
in
a
stack
and
not
another
house
to
be
seen
within
a
mile
or
two
of
the
farmhouse
there
appeared
to
be
no
such
thing
as
barns
but
merely
a
place
to
take
in
a
stack
at
a
time
and
thrash
it
out
by
a
machine
the
country
seems
to
be
almost
wholly
destitute
of
people
immense
tracks
of
but
neither
cottages
nor
churches
there
is
here
and
there
a
spot
of
good
land
just
as
in
the
deep
valleys
that
i
crossed
but
generally
speaking
the
country
is
poor
and
its
bleakness
is
proved
by
the
almost
total
absence
of
the
oak
tree
of
which
we
see
scarcely
one
all
the
way
from
morpeth
to
hexham
very
few
trees
of
any
sort
except
in
the
bottom
of
the
warm
valleys
what
there
are
are
chiefly
the
which
is
a
very
hardy
tree
and
will
live
and
thrive
where
the
will
not
grow
at
all
which
is
very
curious
seeing
that
it
comes
out
into
leaf
so
late
in
the
spring
and
sheds
its
foliage
so
early
in
the
fall
the
trees
which
stand
next
in
point
of
hardiness
are
the
the
and
the
which
are
all
seen
here
but
none
of
them
fine
the
is
the
most
common
tree
and
even
it
flinches
upon
the
hills
which
it
never
does
in
the
south
it
has
generally
become
yellow
in
the
leaf
already
and
many
of
the
trees
are
now
bare
of
leaf
before
any
frost
has
made
its
appearance
the
cattle
all
along
here
are
of
a
coarse
kind
the
cows
and
badly
shaped
kiloe
oxen
except
in
the
dips
of
good
land
by
the
sides
of
the
bourns
which
i
crossed
nevertheless
even
here
the
fields
of
turnips
of
both
sorts
are
very
fine
great
pains
seem
to
be
taken
in
raising
the
crops
of
these
turnips
they
are
all
cultivated
in
rows
are
kept
exceedingly
clean
and
they
are
carried
in
as
winter
food
for
all
the
animals
of
a
farm
the
horses
excepted
as
i
approached
hexham
which
as
the
reader
knows
was
formerly
the
seat
of
a
famous
abbey
and
the
scene
of
a
not
less
famous
battle
and
was
indeed
at
one
time
the
of
a
bishop
and
which
has
now
churches
of
great
antiquity
and
architecture
as
i
approached
this
town
along
a
valley
down
which
runs
a
small
river
that
soon
after
empties
itself
into
the
tyne
the
land
became
good
the
ash
trees
more
lofty
and
green
as
in
june
the
other
trees
proportionably
large
and
fine
and
when
i
got
down
into
the
vale
of
hexham
itself
there
i
found
the
tree
certain
proof
of
a
milder
atmosphere
for
the
though
amongst
the
hardest
is
amongst
the
tenderest
of
plants
known
as
natives
of
our
country
here
everything
assumes
a
different
appearance
the
tyne
the
southern
and
northern
branches
of
which
meet
a
few
miles
above
hexham
runs
close
by
this
ancient
and
celebrated
town
all
round
which
the
ground
rises
gradually
away
towards
the
hills
crowned
here
and
there
with
the
remains
of
those
castles
which
were
formerly
found
necessary
for
the
defence
of
this
rich
and
valuable
valley
which
from
tip
of
hill
to
tip
of
hill
varies
perhaps
from
four
to
seven
miles
wide
and
which
contains
as
fine
as
those
of
wiltshire
and
fields
of
turnips
of
both
kinds
the
largest
finest
and
best
cultivated
that
my
eyes
ever
beheld
as
a
proof
of
the
goodness
of
the
land
and
the
mildness
of
the
climate
here
there
is
in
the
grounds
of
the
gentleman
who
had
the
kindness
to
receive
and
to
entertain
me
and
that
in
a
manner
which
will
prevent
me
from
ever
forgetting
either
him
or
his
most
amiable
wife
there
is
standing
in
his
ground
an
acre
of
my
which
will
ripen
perfectly
well
and
in
the
same
grounds
which
together
with
the
and
all
the
appurtenances
belonging
to
a
house
and
the
house
itself
are
laid
out
arranged
and
contrived
in
a
manner
so
judicious
and
to
me
so
original
as
to
render
them
objects
of
great
interest
though
in
general
i
set
very
little
value
on
the
things
which
appertain
merely
to
the
enjoyments
of
the
rich
in
these
same
grounds
to
come
back
again
to
the
climate
i
perceived
that
the
rather
tender
evergreens
not
only
lived
but
throve
perfectly
well
and
a
criterion
infallible
the
stand
the
winter
without
any
covering
or
any
pains
taken
to
shelter
them
which
as
every
one
knows
is
by
no
means
always
the
case
even
at
kensington
and
fulham
at
night
i
gave
a
lecture
at
an
inn
at
hexham
in
the
midst
of
the
domains
of
that
impudent
and
stupid
man
beaumont
who
not
many
days
before
in
what
he
called
a
speech
i
suppose
made
at
newcastle
thought
proper
as
was
reported
in
the
newspapers
to
utter
the
following
words
with
regard
to
me
never
having
in
his
life
received
the
slightest
provocation
for
so
doing
the
liberty
of
the
press
had
nothing
to
fear
from
the
government
it
was
the
duty
of
the
administration
to
be
upon
their
guard
to
prevent
extremes
there
was
a
crouching
servility
on
the
one
hand
and
an
excitement
to
disorganization
and
to
licentiousness
on
the
other
which
ought
to
be
discountenanced
the
company
he
believed
as
much
disapproved
of
that
political
traveller
who
was
now
going
through
the
country
he
meant
cobbett
as
they
detested
the
servile
effusions
of
the
tories
beaumont
in
addition
to
his
native
stupidity
and
imbecility
might
have
been
drunk
when
he
said
this
but
the
servile
wretch
who
published
it
was
not
drunk
and
at
any
rate
beaumont
was
my
mark
it
not
being
my
custom
to
snap
at
the
stick
but
at
the
cowardly
hand
that
wields
it
such
a
fellow
can
not
be
an
object
of
what
is
properly
called
with
any
man
who
is
worth
a
straw
but
i
say
with
swift
if
a
or
a
bite
me
i
will
kill
it
if
i
can
and
acting
upon
that
principle
i
being
at
hexham
put
my
foot
upon
this
contemptible
creeping
thing
who
is
offering
himself
as
a
candidate
for
the
southern
division
of
the
county
being
so
eminently
fitted
to
be
a
maker
of
the
laws
the
newspapers
have
told
the
whole
country
that
john
ridley
who
is
a
tradesman
at
hexham
and
occupies
some
land
close
by
has
made
a
stand
against
the
demand
for
tithes
and
that
the
recently
broke
open
in
the
night
the
gate
of
his
field
and
carried
away
what
he
deemed
to
be
the
tithe
that
ridley
applied
to
the
magistrates
who
could
only
refer
him
to
a
court
of
law
to
recover
damages
for
the
trespass
when
i
arrived
at
hexham
i
found
this
to
be
the
case
i
further
found
that
beaumont
that
impudent
silly
and
slanderous
beaumont
is
the
of
the
tithes
in
and
round
about
hexham
he
being
in
a
right
line
doubtless
the
heir
or
successor
of
the
abbot
and
monks
of
the
abbey
of
hexham
or
the
heir
of
the
donor
egfrid
of
i
found
that
beaumont
had
leased
out
his
tithes
to
as
is
the
laudable
custom
with
the
pious
bishops
and
clergy
of
the
in
ireland
shields
these
sides
of
the
tyne
are
very
fine
woods
pastures
villages
a
church
every
four
miles
or
thereabouts
cows
and
sheep
beautiful
oak
trees
though
none
very
large
and
in
short
a
fertile
and
beautiful
country
wanting
only
the
gardens
and
the
cottages
that
so
beautify
the
counties
in
the
south
and
the
west
all
the
buildings
are
of
stone
here
are
and
railways
every
now
and
then
the
working
people
seem
to
be
very
well
off
their
dwellings
solid
and
clean
and
their
furniture
good
but
the
little
gardens
and
orchards
are
wanting
the
farms
are
all
large
and
the
people
who
work
on
them
either
live
in
the
farmhouse
or
in
buildings
appertaining
to
the
farmhouse
and
they
are
all
well
fed
and
have
no
temptation
to
acts
like
those
which
sprang
up
out
of
the
of
the
labourers
in
the
south
besides
the
mere
country
people
are
so
few
in
number
the
state
of
society
is
altogether
so
different
that
a
man
who
has
lived
here
all
his
can
form
no
judgment
at
all
with
regard
to
the
situation
the
wants
and
the
treatment
of
the
working
people
in
the
counties
of
the
south
they
have
begun
to
make
a
railway
from
carlisle
to
newcastle
and
i
saw
them
at
work
at
it
as
i
came
along
there
are
great
not
far
from
hexham
and
i
saw
a
great
number
of
little
carts
bringing
down
the
of
to
the
point
where
the
tyne
becomes
navigable
to
newcastle
and
sometimes
i
saw
loads
of
these
lying
by
the
as
you
see
parcels
of
timber
lying
in
kent
and
sussex
and
other
timber
counties
no
fear
of
their
being
stolen
their
weight
is
their
security
together
with
their
value
compared
with
that
of
the
labour
of
carrying
hearing
that
beaumont
was
somehow
or
other
connected
with
this
i
had
got
it
into
my
head
that
he
was
a
pig
of
lead
himself
and
half
expected
to
meet
with
him
amongst
these
groups
of
his
but
upon
inquiry
i
found
that
some
of
the
belonged
to
him
descending
probably
in
that
same
right
line
in
the
tithes
descended
to
and
as
the
bishop
of
durham
is
said
to
be
the
owner
of
great
beaumont
and
the
bishop
may
possibly
be
in
the
with
regard
to
the
subterranean
estate
as
well
as
that
upon
the
surface
and
if
this
should
be
the
case
it
will
i
verily
believe
require
all
the
piety
of
the
bishop
and
all
the
wisdom
of
beaumont
to
keep
the
boat
above
water
for
another
five
years
shields
i
lectured
at
south
shields
last
evening
and
here
this
evening
i
came
over
the
river
from
south
shields
about
eleven
last
night
and
made
a
very
firm
bargain
with
myself
never
to
do
the
like
again
this
evening
after
my
lecture
was
over
some
gentlemen
presented
an
address
to
me
upon
the
stage
before
the
audience
accompanied
with
the
valuable
and
honourable
present
of
the
late
eneas
mackenzie
of
the
county
of
a
very
interesting
work
worthy
of
every
library
in
the
kingdom
from
newcastle
to
morpeth
from
morpeth
to
hexham
and
then
all
the
way
down
the
tyne
though
everywhere
such
abundance
of
fine
turnips
and
in
some
cases
of
you
see
scarcely
any
a
certain
sign
that
the
working
people
do
not
live
like
hogs
this
root
is
raised
in
northumberland
and
durham
to
be
used
merely
as
garden
stuff
and
used
in
that
way
it
is
very
good
the
contrary
of
which
i
never
thought
much
less
did
i
ever
say
it
it
is
the
using
of
it
as
a
for
bread
and
for
meat
that
i
have
deprecated
it
and
when
the
irish
poet
drennen
called
it
the
lazy
root
and
the
root
of
misery
he
gave
it
its
true
character
sir
charles
wolseley
who
has
travelled
a
great
deal
in
france
germany
and
italy
and
who
though
scratched
him
out
of
the
commission
of
the
peace
and
though
the
sincere
patriot
brougham
will
not
put
him
in
again
is
a
very
great
and
accurate
observer
as
to
these
interesting
matters
has
assured
me
that
in
whatever
proportion
the
cultivation
of
potatoes
prevails
in
those
countries
in
that
same
proportion
the
are
wretched
from
this
degrading
curse
from
sitting
round
a
dirty
board
with
potatoes
trundled
out
upon
it
as
the
irish
do
from
going
to
the
field
with
cold
potatoes
in
their
bags
as
the
of
hampshire
and
wiltshire
but
which
they
have
not
done
since
the
appearance
of
certain
which
to
spare
the
feelings
of
the
lambs
the
broughams
the
greys
and
the
russells
and
their
dirty
denman
i
will
not
describe
much
less
will
i
eulogize
from
this
degrading
curse
the
county
of
northumberland
is
yet
happily
free
this
morning
i
left
north
shields
in
a
in
order
to
come
hither
through
newcastle
and
gateshead
this
affording
me
the
only
opportunity
that
i
was
likely
to
have
of
seeing
a
plantation
of
annorer
donkin
close
in
the
neighbourhood
of
newcastle
which
plantation
had
been
made
according
to
the
method
prescribed
in
my
book
called
the
woodlands
and
to
see
which
plantation
i
previously
communicated
a
request
to
donkin
that
gentleman
received
me
in
a
manner
which
will
want
no
describing
to
those
who
have
had
the
good
luck
to
visit
newcastle
the
plantation
is
most
advantageously
circumstanced
to
furnish
proof
of
the
excellence
of
my
instructions
as
to
planting
the
predecessor
of
donkin
also
made
plantations
upon
the
same
spot
and
consisting
precisely
of
the
same
sort
of
trees
the
two
plantations
are
separated
from
each
other
merely
by
a
road
going
through
them
those
of
the
predecessor
have
been
made
those
of
donkin
and
incredible
as
it
may
appear
the
trees
in
the
latter
are
full
as
lofty
as
those
in
the
former
and
besides
the
equal
loftiness
are
vastly
superior
in
point
of
shape
and
which
is
very
curious
retain
all
their
freshness
at
this
season
of
the
year
while
the
old
plantations
are
brownish
and
many
of
the
leaves
falling
off
the
trees
though
the
sort
of
trees
is
precisely
the
same
as
a
sort
of
reward
for
having
thus
contributed
to
this
very
rational
source
of
his
pleasure
donkin
was
good
enough
to
give
me
an
elegant
copy
of
the
fables
of
the
celebrated
bewick
who
was
once
a
native
of
newcastle
and
an
honour
to
the
town
and
whose
books
i
had
had
from
the
time
that
my
children
began
to
look
at
books
until
taken
from
me
by
that
sort
of
rapine
which
i
had
to
experience
at
the
time
of
my
memorable
flight
across
the
atlantic
in
order
to
secure
the
use
of
that
long
arm
which
i
caused
to
reach
them
from
long
island
to
london
in
donkin
my
eyes
being
never
closed
in
such
a
scene
i
saw
what
i
had
never
seen
before
in
any
and
which
it
may
be
very
useful
to
some
of
my
readers
to
have
described
to
them
is
when
destroyed
in
the
spring
never
destroyed
by
but
times
out
of
a
hundred
by
which
descend
always
perpendicularly
and
which
are
generally
fatal
if
they
come
between
the
expansion
of
the
blossom
and
the
setting
of
the
fruit
that
is
to
say
if
they
come
after
the
bloom
is
quite
open
and
before
it
has
disentangled
itself
from
the
fruit
the
great
thing
therefore
in
getting
is
to
keep
off
these
frosts
the
french
make
use
of
boards
in
the
neighbourhood
of
paris
projecting
from
the
tops
of
the
walls
and
supported
by
poles
and
some
persons
contrive
to
have
curtains
to
come
over
the
whole
tree
at
night
and
to
be
drawn
up
in
the
morning
donkin
walls
have
a
top
of
stone
and
this
top
or
cap
projects
about
eight
inches
beyond
the
face
of
the
wall
which
is
quite
sufficient
to
guard
against
the
which
always
fall
perpendicularly
this
is
a
country
of
stone
to
be
sure
but
those
who
can
afford
to
build
walls
for
the
purpose
of
having
can
afford
to
cap
them
in
this
manner
to
rear
the
wall
plant
the
trees
and
then
to
save
the
expense
of
the
cap
is
really
like
the
old
proverbial
absurdity
of
losing
the
ship
for
the
sake
of
saving
a
pennyworth
of
tar
at
donkin
i
saw
a
portrait
of
bewick
which
is
said
to
be
a
great
likeness
and
which
though
imagination
goes
a
great
way
in
such
a
case
really
bespeaks
that
simplicity
accompanied
with
that
genius
which
distinguished
the
man
wm
armstrong
was
kind
enough
to
make
me
a
present
of
a
copy
of
the
last
performance
of
this
so
justly
celebrated
man
it
is
entitled
for
exhibiting
a
poor
old
horse
just
about
to
die
and
preceded
by
an
explanatory
writing
which
does
as
much
honour
to
the
heart
of
bewick
as
the
whole
of
his
designs
put
together
do
to
his
genius
the
sight
of
the
picture
the
reading
of
the
preface
to
it
and
the
fact
that
it
was
the
last
effort
of
the
man
altogether
make
it
difficult
to
prevent
tears
from
starting
from
the
eyes
of
any
one
not
uncommonly
steeled
with
insensibility
you
see
nothing
here
that
is
pretty
but
everything
seems
to
be
abundant
in
value
and
one
great
thing
is
the
working
people
live
well
theirs
is
not
a
life
of
ease
to
be
sure
but
it
is
not
a
life
of
hunger
the
pitmen
have
shillings
a
week
they
live
their
fuel
costs
them
nothing
and
their
doctor
cost
them
nothing
their
work
is
terrible
to
be
sure
and
perhaps
they
do
not
have
what
they
ought
to
have
but
at
any
rate
they
live
well
their
houses
are
good
and
their
furniture
good
and
though
they
live
not
in
a
beautiful
scene
they
are
in
the
scene
where
they
were
born
and
their
lives
seem
to
be
as
good
as
that
of
the
working
part
of
mankind
can
reasonably
expect
almost
the
whole
of
the
country
hereabouts
is
owned
by
that
curious
thing
called
the
and
of
durham
almost
the
whole
of
south
shields
is
theirs
granted
upon
leases
with
fines
at
stated
periods
this
dean
and
chapter
are
the
of
the
londonderry
with
all
his
huffing
and
strutting
is
but
a
tenant
of
the
dean
and
chapter
of
durham
who
souse
him
so
often
with
their
that
it
is
said
that
he
has
had
to
pay
them
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
pounds
within
the
last
ten
or
twelve
years
what
will
londonderry
bet
that
he
is
not
the
of
the
before
this
day
five
years
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
these
cases
but
on
the
contrary
a
very
great
convenience
because
all
these
tenants
of
the
dean
and
chapter
might
then
purchase
and
make
that
property
freehold
which
they
now
hold
by
a
tenure
so
uncertain
and
so
capricious
from
sunderland
i
came
early
in
the
morning
of
the
of
october
once
more
and
i
hope
not
for
the
last
time
to
newcastle
there
to
lecture
on
the
which
i
did
in
the
evening
but
before
i
proceed
further
i
must
record
something
that
i
heard
at
sunderland
respecting
that
babbling
fellow
trevor
my
readers
will
recollect
the
part
which
this
fellow
acted
with
regard
to
the
liberal
whig
prosecution
they
will
recollect
that
it
was
he
who
first
mentioned
the
thing
in
the
house
of
commons
and
suggested
to
the
wise
ministers
the
propriety
of
prosecuting
me
that
lord
althorp
and
denman
and
about
it
that
the
latter
had
read
and
that
the
former
would
offer
no
opinion
upon
it
that
trevor
came
on
again
encouraged
by
the
works
of
the
curate
of
crowhurst
and
by
the
bloody
old
whose
former
editor
and
now
printer
is
actually
a
candidate
for
berkshire
supported
by
that
unprincipled
political
prattler
jephthah
marsh
whom
i
will
call
to
an
account
as
soon
as
i
get
back
to
the
south
my
readers
will
further
recollect
that
the
bloody
old
then
put
forth
another
document
as
a
confession
of
goodman
made
to
burrell
tredcroft
and
scawen
blunt
while
the
culprit
was
in
horsham
jail
with
a
halter
actually
about
his
neck
my
readers
know
the
of
this
affair
but
they
have
yet
to
learn
some
circumstances
belonging
to
its
progress
which
circumstances
are
not
to
be
stated
here
they
recollect
however
that
from
the
very
first
i
treated
this
trevor
with
the
utmost
disdain
and
that
at
the
head
of
the
articles
which
i
wrote
about
him
i
put
these
words
trevor
and
potatoes
meaning
that
he
hated
me
because
i
was
resolved
fire
or
fire
not
that
working
men
should
not
live
upon
potatoes
in
my
country
now
mark
now
chopsticks
of
the
south
mark
the
sagacity
the
justice
the
promptitude
and
the
excellent
taste
of
these
lads
of
the
north
at
the
last
general
election
which
took
place
after
the
liberal
whig
prosecution
had
been
begun
trevor
was
a
candidate
for
the
city
of
durham
which
is
about
fourteen
miles
from
this
busy
town
of
sunderland
the
freemen
of
durham
are
the
voters
in
that
city
and
some
of
these
freemen
reside
at
sunderland
therefore
this
fellow
i
wish
to
god
you
could
him
went
to
sunderland
to
canvass
these
freemen
residing
there
and
they
pelted
him
out
of
the
town
and
oh
appropriate
missiles
pelted
him
out
with
the
accursed
root
hallooing
and
shouting
after
him
and
potatoes
ah
stupid
coxcomb
little
did
he
imagine
when
he
was
playing
his
game
with
althorp
and
denman
what
would
be
the
ultimate
effect
of
that
game
from
newcastle
to
morpeth
the
country
is
what
i
before
described
it
to
be
from
morpeth
to
this
place
alnwick
the
country
generally
speaking
is
very
poor
as
to
land
scarcely
any
trees
at
all
the
farms
enormously
extensive
only
two
churches
i
think
in
the
whole
of
the
twenty
miles
scarcely
anything
worthy
the
name
of
a
tree
and
not
one
single
dwelling
having
the
appearance
of
a
labourer
house
here
appears
neither
hedging
nor
ditching
no
such
thing
as
a
or
a
hurdle
to
be
seen
the
cattle
and
sheep
very
few
in
number
the
farm
servants
living
in
the
and
very
few
of
them
the
thrashing
done
by
machinery
and
horses
a
country
without
people
this
is
a
pretty
country
to
take
a
minister
from
to
govern
the
south
of
england
a
pretty
country
to
take
a
lord
chancellor
from
to
prattle
about
and
about
my
lord
grey
has
in
fact
spent
his
life
here
and
brougham
has
spent
his
life
in
the
inns
of
court
or
in
the
botheration
of
speculative
books
how
should
either
of
them
know
anything
about
the
eastern
southern
or
western
counties
i
wish
i
had
my
dignitary
black
here
i
would
soon
make
him
see
that
he
has
all
these
number
of
years
been
talking
about
the
bull
horns
instead
of
his
tail
and
his
buttocks
besides
the
indescribable
pleasure
of
having
seen
newcastle
the
shieldses
sunderland
durham
and
hexham
i
have
now
discovered
the
true
ground
of
all
the
errors
of
the
scotch
with
regard
to
population
and
with
regard
to
the
two
countries
are
as
different
as
any
two
things
of
the
same
nature
can
possibly
be
that
which
applies
to
the
one
does
not
at
all
apply
to
the
other
the
agricultural
counties
are
covered
all
over
with
parish
churches
and
with
people
thinly
distributed
here
and
there
only
look
at
the
two
counties
of
dorset
and
durham
dorset
contains
square
miles
durham
contains
square
miles
dorset
has
durham
has
parishes
the
population
of
dorset
is
scattered
over
the
whole
of
the
county
there
being
no
town
of
any
magnitude
in
it
the
population
of
durham
though
larger
than
that
of
dorset
is
almost
all
gathered
together
at
the
mouths
of
the
tyne
the
wear
and
the
tees
northumberland
has
square
miles
and
suffolk
has
square
miles
northumberland
has
and
suffolk
has
hundred
and
ten
so
that
here
is
a
county
one
third
part
smaller
than
that
of
northumberland
with
six
times
as
many
villages
in
it
what
comparison
is
there
to
be
made
between
states
of
society
so
essentially
different
what
rule
is
there
with
regard
to
population
and
which
can
apply
to
both
cases
and
how
is
my
lord
howick
born
and
bred
up
in
northumberland
to
know
how
to
judge
of
a
population
suitable
to
suffolk
suffolk
is
a
county
teeming
with
production
as
well
as
with
people
and
how
brutal
must
that
man
be
who
would
attempt
to
reduce
the
agricultural
population
of
suffolk
to
that
of
the
number
of
northumberland
the
population
of
northumberland
larger
than
suffolk
as
it
is
does
not
equal
it
in
total
population
by
nearly
notwithstanding
that
one
half
of
its
whole
population
have
got
together
on
the
banks
of
the
tyne
and
are
we
to
get
rid
of
our
people
in
the
south
and
supply
the
places
of
them
by
horses
and
machines
why
not
have
the
people
in
the
fertile
counties
of
the
south
where
their
very
existence
causes
their
food
and
their
raiment
to
come
blind
and
thoughtless
must
that
man
be
who
imagines
that
all
but
in
the
south
are
unproductive
i
much
question
whether
taking
a
strip
three
miles
each
way
from
the
road
coming
from
newcastle
to
alnwick
an
equal
quantity
of
what
is
called
together
with
the
cottages
that
skirt
it
do
not
exceed
such
strip
of
ground
in
point
of
produce
yes
the
cows
pigs
geese
poultry
gardens
bees
and
fuel
that
arise
from
those
far
exceed
even
in
the
capacity
of
sustaining
people
similar
breadths
of
ground
distributed
into
these
large
farms
in
the
poorer
parts
of
northumberland
i
have
seen
not
less
than
ten
thousand
geese
in
one
tract
of
common
in
about
six
miles
going
from
chobham
towards
farnham
in
surrey
i
believe
these
geese
alone
raised
entirely
by
care
and
by
the
common
to
be
worth
more
than
the
clear
profit
that
can
be
drawn
from
any
similar
breadth
of
land
between
morpeth
and
alnwick
what
folly
is
it
to
talk
then
of
applying
to
the
counties
of
the
south
principles
and
rules
applicable
to
a
country
like
this
morning
i
start
for
modern
athens
my
readers
will
i
dare
say
perceive
how
much
my
has
been
improved
since
i
crossed
the
tyne
what
it
will
get
to
when
i
shall
have
crossed
the
tweed
god
only
knows
i
wish
very
much
that
i
could
stop
a
day
at
berwick
in
order
to
find
some
to
ascertain
by
some
chemical
process
the
exact
degree
of
the
improvement
of
the
i
am
afraid
however
that
i
shall
not
be
able
to
manage
this
for
i
must
get
along
beginning
to
feel
devilishly
since
i
have
left
newcastle
they
tell
me
that
lord
howick
who
is
just
married
made
a
speech
here
the
other
day
during
which
he
said
that
the
reform
was
only
the
means
to
an
end
and
that
the
end
was
cheap
government
good
stand
to
that
my
lord
and
as
you
are
now
married
pray
let
the
country
fellows
and
girls
marry
too
let
us
have
and
i
warrant
you
that
there
will
be
room
for
us
all
and
plenty
for
us
to
eat
and
drink
it
is
the
drones
and
not
the
bees
that
are
too
numerous
it
is
the
vermin
who
live
upon
the
taxes
and
not
those
who
work
to
raise
them
that
we
want
to
get
rid
of
we
are
keeping
fifty
thousand
to
breed
gentlemen
and
ladies
for
the
industrious
and
laborious
to
keep
these
are
the
opinions
which
i
promulgate
and
whatever
your
flatterers
may
say
to
the
contrary
and
whatever
stuff
brougham
and
his
rabble
of
writers
may
put
forth
these
opinions
of
mine
will
finally
prevail
i
repeat
my
anxious
wish
i
would
call
it
a
if
i
could
that
your
father
resolution
may
be
equal
to
his
sense
and
that
he
will
do
that
which
is
demanded
by
the
right
which
the
people
have
to
insist
upon
measures
necessary
to
restore
the
greatness
and
happiness
of
the
country
and
if
he
show
a
disposition
to
do
this
i
should
deem
myself
the
most
criminal
of
all
mankind
if
i
were
to
make
use
of
any
influence
that
i
possess
to
render
his
undertaking
more
difficult
than
it
naturally
must
be
but
if
he
show
not
that
disposition
it
will
be
my
bounden
duty
to
endeavour
to
drive
him
from
the
possession
of
power
for
be
the
consequences
to
individuals
what
they
may
the
greatness
the
freedom
and
the
happiness
of

be
restored
