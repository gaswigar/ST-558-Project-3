the
reverberator
by
henry
james
i
i
guess
my
daughter
s
in
here
the
old
man
said
leading
the
way
into
the
little
salon
de
lecture
he
was
not
of
the
most
advanced
age
but
that
is
the
way
george
flack
considered
him
and
indeed
he
looked
older
than
he
was
george
flack
had
found
him
sitting
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
he
sat
a
great
deal
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
and
had
gone
up
to
him
with
characteristic
directness
and
asked
him
for
miss
francina
poor
dosson
had
with
the
greatest
docility
disposed
himself
to
wait
on
the
young
man
he
had
as
a
matter
of
course
risen
and
made
his
way
across
the
court
to
announce
to
his
child
that
she
had
a
visitor
he
looked
submissive
almost
servile
as
he
preceded
the
visitor
thrusting
his
head
forward
in
his
quest
but
it
was
not
in
flack
s
line
to
notice
that
sort
of
thing
he
accepted
the
old
gentleman
s
good
offices
as
he
would
have
accepted
those
of
a
waiter
conveying
no
hint
of
an
attention
paid
also
to
himself
an
observer
of
these
two
persons
would
have
assured
himself
that
the
degree
to
which
dosson
thought
it
natural
any
one
should
want
to
see
his
daughter
was
only
equalled
by
the
degree
to
which
the
young
man
thought
it
natural
her
father
should
take
trouble
to
produce
her
there
was
a
superfluous
drapery
in
the
doorway
of
the
salon
de
lecture
which
dosson
pushed
aside
while
george
flack
stepped
in
after
him
the
of
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
was
none
too
ample
and
had
seemed
to
dosson
from
the
first
to
consist
principally
of
a
floor
on
the
bareness
of
which
it
was
easy
for
a
relaxed
elderly
american
to
slip
it
was
composed
further
to
his
perception
of
a
table
with
a
green
velvet
cloth
of
a
fireplace
with
a
great
deal
of
fringe
and
no
fire
of
a
window
with
a
great
deal
of
curtain
and
no
light
and
of
the
figaro
which
he
couldn
t
read
and
the
new
york
herald
which
he
had
already
read
a
single
person
was
just
now
in
possession
of
these
conveniences
a
young
lady
who
sat
with
her
back
to
the
window
looking
straight
before
her
into
the
conventional
room
she
was
dressed
as
for
the
street
her
empty
hands
rested
upon
the
arms
of
her
chair
she
had
withdrawn
her
long
gloves
which
were
lying
in
her
lap
and
she
seemed
to
be
doing
nothing
as
hard
as
she
could
her
face
was
so
much
in
shadow
as
to
be
barely
distinguishable
nevertheless
the
young
man
had
a
disappointed
cry
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
why
it
ain
t
miss
francie
it
s
miss
delia
well
i
guess
we
can
fix
that
said
dosson
wandering
further
into
the
room
and
drawing
his
feet
over
the
floor
without
lifting
them
whatever
he
did
he
ever
seemed
to
wander
he
had
an
impermanent
transitory
air
an
aspect
of
weary
yet
patient
even
when
he
sat
as
he
was
capable
of
sitting
for
hours
in
the
court
of
the
inn
as
he
glanced
down
at
the
two
newspapers
in
their
desert
of
green
velvet
he
raised
a
hopeless
uninterested
glass
to
his
eye
delia
dear
where
s
your
little
sister
delia
made
no
movement
whatever
nor
did
any
expression
so
far
as
could
be
perceived
pass
over
her
large
young
face
she
only
ejaculated
why
flack
where
did
you
drop
from
well
this
is
a
good
place
to
meet
her
father
remarked
as
if
mildly
and
as
a
mere
passing
suggestion
to
deprecate
explanations
any
place
is
good
where
one
meets
old
friends
said
george
flack
looking
also
at
the
newspapers
he
examined
the
date
of
the
american
sheet
and
then
put
it
down
well
how
do
you
like
paris
he
subsequently
went
on
to
the
young
lady
we
quite
enjoy
it
but
of
course
we
re
familiar
well
i
was
in
hopes
i
could
show
you
something
flack
said
i
guess
they
ve
seen
most
everything
dosson
observed
well
we
ve
seen
more
than
you
exclaimed
his
daughter
well
i
ve
seen
a
good
deal
just
sitting
a
person
with
delicate
ear
might
have
suspected
dosson
of
a
tendency
to
setting
but
he
would
pronounce
the
same
word
in
a
different
manner
at
different
times
well
in
paris
you
can
see
everything
said
the
young
man
i
m
quite
enthusiastic
about
haven
t
you
been
here
before
miss
delia
asked
oh
yes
but
it
s
ever
fresh
and
how
is
miss
francie
she
s
all
right
she
has
gone
upstairs
to
get
something
i
guess
we
re
going
out
it
s
very
attractive
for
the
young
dosson
pleaded
to
the
visitor
well
then
i
m
one
of
the
young
do
you
mind
if
i
go
with
you
flack
continued
to
the
girl
it
ll
seem
like
old
times
on
the
deck
she
replied
we
re
going
to
the
bon
why
don
t
you
go
to
the
louvre
that
s
the
place
for
we
ve
just
come
from
there
we
ve
had
quite
a
well
it
s
a
good
place
the
visitor
a
trifle
dryly
opined
it
s
good
for
some
things
but
it
doesn
t
come
up
to
my
idea
for
oh
they
ve
seen
everything
said
dosson
then
he
added
i
guess
i
ll
go
and
call
well
tell
her
to
hurry
miss
delia
returned
swinging
a
glove
in
each
hand
she
knows
my
pace
flack
remarked
i
should
think
she
would
the
way
you
raced
the
girl
returned
with
memories
of
the
umbria
i
hope
you
don
t
expect
to
rush
round
paris
that
i
always
rush
i
live
in
a
rush
that
s
the
way
to
get
well
i
am
through
i
guess
said
dosson
philosophically
well
i
ain
t
his
daughter
declared
with
decision
well
you
must
come
round
often
he
continued
to
their
friend
as
a
oh
i
ll
come
round
i
ll
have
to
rush
but
i
ll
do
i
ll
send
down
and
francie
s
father
crept
away
and
please
give
her
some
more
money
her
sister
called
after
him
does
she
keep
the
money
george
flack
enquired
keep
it
dosson
stopped
as
he
pushed
aside
the
portiere
oh
you
innocent
young
man
i
guess
it
s
the
first
time
you
were
ever
called
innocent
cried
delia
left
alone
with
the
visitor
well
i
was
before
i
came
to
well
i
can
t
see
that
it
has
hurt
us
we
ain
t
a
speck
wouldn
t
you
have
a
right
to
be
i
don
t
think
any
one
has
a
right
to
be
miss
dosson
returned
incorruptibly
the
young
man
who
had
seated
himself
looked
at
her
a
moment
that
s
the
way
you
used
to
well
i
haven
t
and
miss
francie
has
she
well
you
ll
see
said
delia
dosson
beginning
to
draw
on
her
gloves
her
companion
watched
her
leaning
forward
with
his
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
and
his
hands
interlocked
at
last
he
said
interrogatively
bon
marche
no
i
got
them
in
a
little
place
i
well
they
re
paris
of
course
they
re
paris
but
you
can
get
gloves
you
must
show
me
the
little
place
anyhow
flack
continued
sociably
and
he
observed
further
and
with
the
same
friendliness
the
old
gentleman
seems
all
oh
he
s
the
dearest
of
the
he
s
a
real
gentleman
of
the
old
stamp
said
george
flack
well
what
should
you
think
our
father
would
be
i
should
think
he
d
be
delighted
well
he
is
when
we
carry
out
our
and
what
are
they
your
plans
asked
the
young
man
oh
i
never
tell
how
then
does
he
know
whether
you
carry
them
out
well
i
guess
he
d
know
it
if
we
didn
t
said
the
girl
i
remember
how
secretive
you
were
last
year
you
kept
everything
to
well
i
know
what
i
want
the
young
lady
pursued
he
watched
her
button
one
of
her
gloves
deftly
using
a
hairpin
released
from
some
mysterious
office
under
her
bonnet
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
after
which
they
looked
up
at
each
other
i
ve
an
idea
you
don
t
want
me
said
george
flack
oh
yes
i
do
as
a
of
all
the
mean
ways
of
trying
to
get
rid
of
a
man
that
s
the
meanest
he
rang
out
where
s
the
meanness
when
i
suppose
you
re
not
so
ridiculous
as
to
wish
to
be
anything
more
more
to
your
sister
do
you
mean
or
to
yourself
my
sister
is
myself
i
haven
t
got
any
other
said
delia
dosson
any
other
sister
don
t
be
idiotic
are
you
still
in
the
same
business
the
girl
went
on
well
i
forget
which
one
i
was
why
something
to
do
with
that
newspaper
don
t
you
remember
yes
but
it
isn
t
that
paper
any
more
it
s
a
different
do
you
go
round
for
news
in
the
same
way
well
i
try
to
get
the
people
what
they
want
it
s
hard
work
said
the
young
man
well
i
suppose
if
you
didn
t
some
one
else
would
they
will
have
it
won
t
they
yes
they
will
have
the
wants
of
the
people
however
appeared
at
the
present
moment
to
interest
flack
less
than
his
own
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
remarked
that
the
old
gentleman
didn
t
seem
to
have
much
authority
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
girl
asked
why
with
miss
francie
she
s
taking
her
time
or
rather
i
mean
she
s
taking
well
if
you
expect
to
do
anything
with
her
you
must
give
her
plenty
of
that
delia
returned
all
right
i
ll
give
her
all
i
and
miss
dosson
s
interlocutor
leaned
back
in
his
chair
with
folded
arms
as
to
signify
how
much
if
it
came
to
that
she
might
have
to
count
with
his
patience
but
she
sat
there
easy
and
empty
giving
no
sign
and
fearing
no
future
he
was
the
first
indeed
to
turn
again
to
restlessness
at
the
end
of
a
few
moments
he
asked
the
young
lady
if
she
didn
t
suppose
her
father
had
told
her
sister
who
it
was
do
you
think
that
s
all
that
s
required
she
made
answer
with
cold
gaiety
but
she
added
more
familiarly
probably
that
s
the
reason
she
s
so
oh
yes
she
used
to
look
no
that
s
her
peculiarity
that
she
never
looks
it
and
yet
suffers
well
you
make
it
up
for
her
then
miss
delia
the
young
man
ventured
to
declare
you
don
t
suffer
no
for
francie
i
m
all
there
i
guess
i
could
act
for
he
had
a
pause
you
act
for
her
too
much
if
it
wasn
t
for
you
i
think
i
could
do
well
you
ve
got
to
kill
me
first
delia
dosson
replied
i
ll
come
down
on
you
somehow
in
the
reverberator
he
went
on
but
the
threat
left
her
calm
oh
that
s
not
what
the
people
no
unfortunately
they
don
t
care
anything
about
my
well
we
do
we
re
kinder
than
most
francie
and
i
said
the
girl
but
we
desire
to
keep
your
affairs
quite
distinct
from
oh
your
yours
if
i
could
only
discover
what
they
are
cried
george
flack
and
during
the
rest
of
the
time
that
they
waited
the
young
journalist
tried
to
find
out
if
an
observer
had
chanced
to
be
present
for
the
quarter
of
an
hour
that
elapsed
and
had
had
any
attention
to
give
to
these
vulgar
young
persons
he
would
have
wondered
perhaps
at
there
being
so
much
mystery
on
one
side
and
so
much
curiosity
on
the
other
wondered
at
least
at
the
elaboration
of
inscrutable
projects
on
the
part
of
a
girl
who
looked
to
the
casual
eye
as
if
she
were
stolidly
passive
fidelia
dosson
whose
name
had
been
shortened
was
years
old
and
had
a
large
white
face
in
which
the
eyes
were
far
apart
her
forehead
was
high
but
her
mouth
was
small
her
hair
was
light
and
colourless
and
a
certain
inelegant
thickness
of
figure
made
her
appear
shorter
than
she
was
elegance
indeed
had
not
been
her
natural
portion
and
the
bon
marche
and
other
establishments
had
to
make
up
for
that
to
a
casual
sister
s
eye
they
would
scarce
have
appeared
to
have
acquitted
themselves
of
their
office
but
even
a
woman
wouldn
t
have
guessed
how
little
fidelia
cared
she
always
looked
the
same
all
the
contrivances
of
paris
couldn
t
fill
out
that
blank
and
she
held
them
for
herself
in
no
manner
of
esteem
it
was
a
plain
clean
round
pattern
face
marked
for
recognition
among
so
many
only
perhaps
by
a
small
figure
the
sprig
on
a
china
plate
that
might
have
denoted
deep
obstinacy
and
yet
with
its
settled
smoothness
it
was
neither
stupid
nor
hard
it
was
as
calm
as
a
room
kept
dusted
and
aired
for
candid
earnest
occasions
the
meeting
of
unanimous
committees
and
the
discussion
of
flourishing
businesses
if
she
had
been
a
young
man
and
she
had
a
little
the
head
of
one
it
would
probably
have
been
thought
of
her
that
she
was
likely
to
become
a
doctor
or
a
judge
an
observer
would
have
gathered
further
that
flack
s
acquaintance
with
dosson
and
his
daughters
had
had
its
origin
in
his
crossing
the
atlantic
eastward
in
their
company
more
than
a
year
before
and
in
some
slight
association
immediately
after
disembarking
but
that
each
party
had
come
and
gone
a
good
deal
since
then
come
and
gone
however
without
meeting
again
it
was
to
be
inferred
that
in
this
interval
miss
dosson
had
led
her
father
and
sister
back
to
their
native
land
and
had
then
a
second
time
directed
their
course
to
europe
this
was
a
new
departure
said
flack
or
rather
a
new
arrival
he
understood
that
it
wasn
t
as
he
called
it
the
same
old
visit
she
didn
t
repudiate
the
accusation
launched
by
her
companion
as
if
it
might
have
been
embarrassing
of
having
spent
her
time
at
home
in
boston
and
even
in
a
suburban
quarter
of
it
she
confessed
that
as
bostonians
they
had
been
capable
of
that
but
now
they
had
come
abroad
for
longer
ever
so
much
what
they
had
gone
home
for
was
to
make
arrangements
for
a
european
stay
of
which
the
limits
were
not
to
be
told
so
far
as
this
particular
future
opened
out
to
her
she
freely
acknowledged
it
it
appeared
to
meet
with
george
flack
s
approval
he
also
had
a
big
undertaking
on
that
side
and
it
might
require
years
so
that
it
would
be
pleasant
to
have
his
friends
right
there
he
knew
his
way
round
in
paris
or
any
place
like
that
much
better
than
round
boston
if
they
had
been
poked
away
in
one
of
those
clever
suburbs
they
would
have
been
lost
to
him
oh
well
you
ll
see
as
much
as
you
want
of
us
the
way
you
ll
have
to
take
us
delia
dosson
said
which
led
the
young
man
to
ask
which
that
way
was
and
to
guess
he
had
never
known
but
one
way
to
take
anything
which
was
just
as
it
came
oh
well
you
ll
see
what
you
ll
make
of
it
the
girl
returned
and
she
would
give
for
the
present
no
further
explanation
of
her
somewhat
chilling
speech
in
spite
if
it
however
she
professed
an
interest
in
flack
s
announced
undertaking
an
interest
springing
apparently
from
an
interest
in
the
personage
himself
the
man
of
wonderments
and
measurements
we
have
smuggled
into
the
scene
would
have
gathered
that
miss
dosson
s
attention
was
founded
on
a
conception
of
flack
s
intrinsic
brilliancy
would
his
own
impression
have
justified
that
would
he
have
found
such
a
conception
contagious
i
forbear
to
ridicule
the
thought
for
that
would
saddle
me
with
the
care
of
showing
what
right
our
officious
observer
might
have
had
to
his
particular
standard
let
us
therefore
simply
note
that
george
flack
had
grounds
for
looming
publicly
large
to
an
uninformed
young
woman
he
was
connected
as
she
supposed
with
literature
and
wasn
t
a
sympathy
with
literature
one
of
the
many
engaging
attributes
of
her
so
generally
attractive
little
sister
if
flack
was
a
writer
francie
was
a
reader
hadn
t
a
trail
of
forgotten
tauchnitzes
marked
the
former
line
of
travel
of
the
party
of
three
the
elder
girl
grabbed
at
them
on
leaving
hotels
and
but
usually
found
that
she
had
brought
odd
volumes
she
considered
however
that
as
a
family
they
had
an
intellectual
link
with
the
young
journalist
and
would
have
been
surprised
if
she
had
heard
the
advantage
of
his
acquaintance
questioned
flack
s
appearance
was
not
so
much
a
property
of
his
own
as
a
prejudice
or
a
fixed
liability
of
those
who
looked
at
him
whoever
they
might
be
what
they
saw
mainly
in
him
was
that
they
had
seen
him
before
and
oddly
enough
this
recognition
carried
with
it
in
general
no
ability
to
remember
that
is
to
recall
him
you
couldn
t
conveniently
have
prefigured
him
and
it
was
only
when
you
were
conscious
of
him
that
you
knew
you
had
already
somehow
paid
for
it
to
carry
him
in
your
mind
you
must
have
liked
him
very
much
for
no
other
sentiment
not
even
aversion
would
have
taught
you
what
distinguished
him
in
his
group
aversion
in
especial
would
have
made
you
aware
only
of
what
confounded
him
he
was
not
a
specific
person
but
had
beyond
even
delia
dosson
in
whom
we
have
facially
noted
it
the
quality
of
the
sample
or
advertisement
the
air
of
representing
a
line
of
goods
for
which
there
is
a
steady
popular
demand
you
would
scarce
have
expected
him
to
be
individually
designated
a
number
like
that
of
the
day
s
newspaper
would
have
served
all
his
or
at
least
all
your
purpose
and
you
would
have
vaguely
supposed
the
number
high
somewhere
up
in
the
millions
as
every
copy
of
the
newspaper
answers
to
its
name
miss
dosson
s
visitor
would
have
been
quite
adequately
marked
as
young
commercial
let
me
add
that
among
the
accidents
of
his
appearance
was
that
of
its
sometimes
striking
other
young
commercial
americans
as
fine
he
was
years
old
and
had
a
small
square
head
a
light
grey
overcoat
and
in
his
right
forefinger
a
curious
natural
crook
which
might
have
availed
under
pressure
to
identify
him
but
for
the
convenience
of
society
he
ought
always
to
have
worn
something
conspicuous
a
green
hat
or
a
yellow
necktie
his
undertaking
was
to
obtain
material
in
europe
for
an
american
if
it
be
objected
to
all
this
that
when
francie
dosson
at
last
came
in
she
addressed
him
as
if
she
easily
placed
him
the
answer
is
that
she
had
been
notified
by
her
father
and
more
punctually
than
was
indicated
by
the
manner
of
her
response
well
the
way
you
do
turn
up
she
said
smiling
and
holding
out
her
left
hand
to
him
in
the
other
hand
or
the
hollow
of
her
slim
right
arm
she
had
a
lumpish
parcel
though
she
had
made
him
wait
she
was
clearly
very
glad
to
see
him
there
and
she
as
evidently
required
and
enjoyed
a
great
deal
of
that
sort
of
indulgence
her
sister
s
attitude
would
have
told
you
so
even
if
her
own
appearance
had
not
there
was
that
in
her
manner
to
the
young
man
a
perceptible
but
indefinable
shade
which
seemed
to
legitimate
the
oddity
of
his
having
asked
in
particular
for
her
asked
as
if
he
wished
to
see
her
to
the
exclusion
of
her
father
and
sister
the
note
of
a
special
pleasure
which
might
have
implied
a
special
relation
and
yet
a
spectator
looking
from
george
flack
to
miss
francie
dosson
would
have
been
much
at
a
loss
to
guess
what
special
relation
could
exist
between
them
the
girl
was
exceedingly
extraordinarily
pretty
all
exempt
from
traceable
likeness
to
her
sister
and
there
was
a
brightness
in
her
a
still
and
scattered
radiance
which
was
quite
distinct
from
what
is
called
animation
rather
tall
than
short
fine
slender
erect
with
an
airy
lightness
of
hand
and
foot
she
yet
gave
no
impression
of
quick
movement
of
abundant
chatter
of
excitable
nerves
and
irrepressible
life
no
hint
of
arriving
at
her
typical
american
grace
in
the
most
usual
way
she
was
pretty
without
emphasis
and
as
might
almost
have
been
said
without
point
and
your
fancy
that
a
little
stiffness
would
have
improved
her
was
at
once
qualified
by
the
question
of
what
her
softness
would
have
made
of
it
there
was
nothing
in
her
however
to
confirm
the
implication
that
she
had
rushed
about
the
deck
of
a
cunarder
with
a
she
was
as
straight
as
a
wand
and
as
true
as
a
gem
her
neck
was
long
and
her
grey
eyes
had
colour
and
from
the
ripple
of
her
dark
brown
hair
to
the
curve
of
her
unaffirmative
chin
every
line
in
her
face
was
happy
and
pure
she
had
a
weak
pipe
of
a
voice
and
inconceivabilities
of
ignorance
delia
got
up
and
they
came
out
of
the
little
this
young
lady
remarking
to
her
sister
that
she
hoped
she
had
brought
down
all
the
things
well
i
had
a
fiendish
hunt
for
them
we
ve
got
so
many
francie
replied
with
a
strange
want
of
articulation
there
were
a
few
dozens
of
the
i
couldn
t
find
but
i
guess
i
ve
got
most
of
them
and
most
of
the
well
what
are
you
carting
them
about
for
george
flack
enquired
taking
the
parcel
from
her
you
had
better
let
me
handle
them
do
you
buy
by
the
hundred
well
it
only
makes
fifty
apiece
francie
yieldingly
smiled
they
ain
t
really
nice
we
re
going
to
change
oh
i
won
t
be
mixed
up
with
that
you
can
t
work
that
game
on
these
frenchmen
the
young
man
stated
oh
with
francie
they
ll
take
anything
back
delia
dosson
declared
they
just
love
her
all
well
they
re
like
me
then
said
flack
with
friendly
cheer
i
ll
take
her
back
if
she
ll
well
i
don
t
think
i
m
ready
quite
yet
the
girl
replied
but
i
hope
very
much
we
shall
cross
with
you
talk
about
crossing
it
s
on
these
boulevards
we
want
a
delia
loudly
commented
they
had
passed
out
of
the
hotel
and
the
wide
vista
of
the
rue
de
la
paix
stretched
up
and
down
there
were
many
vehicles
won
t
this
thing
do
i
ll
tie
it
to
either
of
you
george
flack
said
holding
out
his
bundle
i
suppose
they
won
t
kill
you
if
they
love
you
he
went
on
to
the
object
of
his
preference
well
you
ve
got
to
know
me
first
she
answered
laughing
and
looking
for
a
chance
while
they
waited
to
pass
over
i
didn
t
know
you
when
i
was
he
applied
his
disengaged
hand
to
her
elbow
and
propelled
her
across
the
street
she
took
no
notice
of
his
observation
and
delia
asked
her
on
the
other
side
whether
their
father
had
given
her
that
money
she
replied
that
he
had
given
her
loads
she
felt
as
if
he
had
made
his
will
which
led
george
flack
to
say
that
he
wished
the
old
gentleman
was
his
father
why
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
want
to
be
our
brother
francie
prattled
as
they
went
down
the
rue
de
la
paix
i
should
like
to
be
miss
delia
s
if
you
can
make
that
out
he
laughed
well
then
suppose
you
prove
it
by
calling
me
a
cab
miss
delia
returned
i
presume
you
and
francie
don
t
take
this
for
a
don
t
she
feel
rich
george
flack
demanded
of
francie
but
we
do
require
a
cart
for
our
goods
and
he
hailed
a
little
yellow
carriage
which
presently
drew
up
beside
the
pavement
the
three
got
into
it
and
still
emitting
innocent
pleasantries
proceeded
on
their
way
while
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
dosson
wandered
down
into
the
court
again
and
took
his
place
in
his
customary
chair
ii
the
court
was
roofed
with
glass
the
april
air
was
mild
the
cry
of
women
selling
violets
came
in
from
the
street
and
mingling
with
the
rich
hum
of
paris
seemed
to
bring
with
it
faintly
the
odour
of
the
flowers
there
were
other
odours
in
the
place
warm
succulent
and
parisian
which
ranged
from
fried
fish
to
burnt
sugar
and
there
were
many
things
besides
little
tables
for
the
coffee
piles
of
luggage
inscribed
after
the
initials
or
frequently
the
name
scudamore
or
jackson
hodge
philadelphia
or
louis
mo
rattles
of
unregarded
bells
flittings
of
waiters
conversations
with
the
windows
of
admonitory
landladies
arrivals
of
young
women
with
coffinlike
bandboxes
covered
with
black
and
depending
from
a
strap
of
persons
staying
and
arrivals
just
afterwards
of
other
persons
to
see
them
together
with
vague
prostrations
on
benches
of
tired
heads
of
american
families
it
was
to
this
last
element
that
dosson
himself
in
some
degree
contributed
but
it
must
be
added
that
he
had
not
the
extremely
bereft
and
exhausted
appearance
of
certain
of
his
fellows
there
was
an
air
of
ruminant
resignation
of
habitual
accommodation
in
him
but
you
would
have
guessed
that
he
was
enjoying
a
holiday
rather
than
aching
for
a
truce
and
he
was
not
so
enfeebled
but
that
he
was
able
to
get
up
from
time
to
time
and
stroll
through
the
porte
cochere
to
have
a
look
at
the
street
he
gazed
up
and
down
for
five
minutes
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
then
came
back
that
appeared
to
content
him
he
asked
for
little
and
had
no
restlessness
that
these
small
excursions
wouldn
t
assuage
he
looked
at
the
luggage
at
the
tinkling
bells
at
the
young
women
from
the
lingere
at
the
repudiated
visitors
at
everything
but
the
other
american
parents
something
in
his
breast
told
him
that
he
knew
all
about
these
it
s
not
upon
each
other
that
the
animals
in
the
same
cage
in
a
zoological
collection
most
turn
their
eyes
there
was
a
silent
sociability
in
him
and
a
superficial
fineness
of
grain
that
helped
to
account
for
his
daughter
francie
s
various
delicacies
he
was
fair
and
spare
and
had
no
figure
you
would
have
seen
in
a
moment
that
the
question
of
how
he
should
hold
himself
had
never
in
his
life
occurred
to
him
he
never
held
himself
at
all
providence
held
him
rather
and
very
loosely
by
an
invisible
string
at
the
end
of
which
he
seemed
gently
to
dangle
and
waver
his
face
was
so
smooth
that
his
thin
light
whiskers
which
grew
only
far
back
scarcely
seemed
native
to
his
cheeks
they
might
have
been
attached
there
for
some
harmless
purpose
of
comedy
or
disguise
he
looked
for
the
most
part
as
if
he
were
thinking
over
without
exactly
understanding
it
something
rather
droll
that
had
just
occurred
if
his
eyes
wandered
his
attention
rested
just
as
it
hurried
quite
as
little
his
feet
were
remarkably
small
and
his
clothes
in
which
light
colours
predominated
were
visibly
the
work
of
a
french
tailor
he
was
an
american
who
still
held
the
tradition
that
it
is
in
paris
a
man
dresses
himself
best
his
hat
would
have
looked
odd
in
bond
street
or
the
fifth
avenue
and
his
necktie
was
loose
and
flowing
dosson
it
may
further
be
noted
was
a
person
of
the
simplest
composition
a
character
as
cipherable
as
a
sum
of
two
figures
he
had
a
native
financial
faculty
of
the
finest
order
a
gift
as
direct
as
a
beautiful
tenor
voice
which
had
enabled
him
without
the
aid
of
particular
strength
of
will
or
keenness
of
ambition
to
build
up
a
large
fortune
while
he
was
still
of
middle
age
he
had
a
genius
for
happy
speculation
the
quick
unerring
instinct
of
a
good
thing
and
as
he
sat
there
idle
amused
contented
on
the
edge
of
the
parisian
street
he
might
very
well
have
passed
for
some
rare
performer
who
had
sung
his
song
or
played
his
trick
and
had
nothing
to
do
till
the
next
call
and
he
had
grown
rich
not
because
he
was
ravenous
or
hard
but
simply
because
he
had
an
ear
not
to
term
it
a
nose
he
could
make
out
the
tune
in
the
discord
of
the
he
could
smell
success
far
up
the
wind
the
second
factor
in
his
little
addition
was
that
he
was
an
unassuming
father
he
had
no
tastes
no
acquirements
no
curiosities
and
his
daughters
represented
all
society
for
him
he
thought
much
more
and
much
oftener
of
these
young
ladies
than
of
his
and
they
crowned
much
more
his
sense
of
accumulated
property
he
never
compared
them
with
other
girls
he
only
compared
his
present
self
with
what
he
would
have
been
without
them
his
view
of
them
was
perfectly
simple
delia
had
a
greater
direct
knowledge
of
life
and
francie
a
wider
acquaintance
with
literature
and
art
dosson
had
not
perhaps
a
full
perception
of
his
younger
daughter
s
beauty
he
would
scarcely
have
pretended
to
judge
of
that
more
than
he
would
of
a
valuable
picture
or
vase
but
he
believed
she
was
cultivated
up
to
the
eyes
he
had
a
recollection
of
tremendous
and
in
later
days
during
their
travels
of
the
way
she
was
always
leaving
books
behind
her
moreover
wasn
t
her
french
so
good
that
he
couldn
t
understand
it
the
two
girls
at
any
rate
formed
the
breeze
in
his
sail
and
the
only
directing
determinant
force
he
knew
when
anything
happened
and
he
was
under
the
impression
that
things
did
happen
they
were
there
for
it
to
have
happened
to
without
them
in
short
as
he
felt
he
would
have
been
the
tail
without
the
kite
the
wind
rose
and
fell
of
course
there
were
lulls
and
there
were
gales
there
were
intervals
during
which
he
simply
floated
in
quiet
waters
cast
anchor
and
waited
this
appeared
to
be
one
of
them
now
but
he
could
be
patient
knowing
that
he
should
soon
again
inhale
the
brine
and
feel
the
dip
of
his
prow
when
his
daughters
were
out
for
any
time
the
occasion
affected
him
as
a
the
wind
would
be
then
as
a
kind
of
consequence
going
to
rise
but
their
now
being
out
with
a
remarkably
bright
young
man
only
sweetened
the
temporary
calm
that
belonged
to
their
superior
life
and
dosson
never
doubted
that
george
flack
was
remarkably
bright
he
represented
the
newspaper
and
the
newspaper
for
this
man
of
genial
assumptions
represented
well
all
other
representations
whatever
to
know
delia
and
francie
thus
attended
by
an
editor
or
a
correspondent
was
really
to
see
them
dancing
in
the
central
glow
this
is
doubtless
why
dosson
had
slightly
more
than
usual
his
air
of
recovering
slowly
from
a
pleasant
surprise
the
vision
to
which
i
allude
hung
before
him
at
a
convenient
distance
and
melted
into
other
bright
confused
aspects
reminiscences
of
flack
in
other
relations
on
the
ship
on
the
deck
at
the
hotel
at
liverpool
and
in
the
cars
whitney
dosson
was
a
loyal
father
but
he
would
have
thought
himself
simple
had
he
not
had
two
or
three
strong
convictions
one
of
which
was
that
the
children
should
never
go
out
with
a
gentleman
they
hadn
t
seen
before
the
sense
of
their
having
and
his
having
seen
flack
before
was
comfortable
to
him
now
it
made
mere
placidity
of
his
personally
foregoing
the
young
man
s
society
in
favour
of
delia
and
francie
he
had
not
hitherto
been
perfectly
satisfied
that
the
streets
and
shops
the
general
immensity
of
paris
were
just
the
safest
place
for
young
ladies
alone
but
the
company
of
a
helpful
gentleman
ensured
safety
a
gentleman
who
would
be
helpful
by
the
fact
of
his
knowing
so
much
and
having
it
all
right
there
if
a
big
newspaper
told
you
everything
there
was
in
the
world
every
morning
that
was
what
a
big
would
have
to
know
and
dosson
had
never
supposed
there
was
anything
left
to
know
when
such
voices
as
flack
s
and
that
of
his
organ
had
daily
been
heard
in
the
absence
of
such
happy
chances
and
in
one
way
or
another
they
kept
occurring
his
girls
might
have
seemed
lonely
which
was
not
the
way
he
struck
himself
they
were
his
company
but
he
scarcely
theirs
it
was
as
if
they
belonged
to
him
more
than
he
to
them
they
were
out
a
long
time
but
he
felt
no
anxiety
as
he
reflected
that
flack
s
very
profession
would
somehow
make
everything
turn
out
to
their
profit
the
bright
french
afternoon
waned
without
bringing
them
back
yet
dosson
still
revolved
about
the
court
till
he
might
have
been
taken
for
a
valet
de
place
hoping
to
pick
up
custom
the
landlady
smiled
at
him
sometimes
as
she
passed
and
and
even
ventured
to
remark
disinterestedly
that
it
was
a
pity
to
waste
such
a
lovely
day
indoors
not
to
take
a
turn
and
see
what
was
going
on
in
paris
but
dosson
had
no
sense
of
waste
that
came
to
him
much
more
when
he
was
confronted
with
historical
monuments
or
beauties
of
nature
or
art
which
affected
him
as
the
talk
of
people
naming
others
naming
friends
of
theirs
whom
he
had
never
heard
of
then
he
was
aware
of
a
degree
of
waste
for
the
others
as
if
somebody
lost
something
but
never
when
he
lounged
in
that
simplifying
yet
so
comprehensive
way
in
the
court
it
wanted
but
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
dinner
that
historic
fact
was
not
beyond
his
measure
when
delia
and
francie
at
last
met
his
view
still
accompanied
by
flack
and
sauntering
in
at
a
little
distance
from
each
other
with
a
jaded
air
which
was
not
in
the
least
a
tribute
to
his
possible
solicitude
they
dropped
into
chairs
and
joked
with
each
other
mingling
sociability
and
languor
on
the
subject
of
what
they
had
seen
and
done
a
question
into
which
he
felt
as
yet
the
delicacy
of
enquiring
but
they
had
evidently
done
a
good
deal
and
had
a
good
time
an
impression
sufficient
to
rescue
dosson
personally
from
the
consciousness
of
failure
won
t
you
just
step
in
and
take
dinner
with
us
he
asked
of
the
young
man
with
a
friendliness
to
which
everything
appeared
to
minister
well
that
s
a
handsome
offer
george
flack
replied
while
delia
put
it
on
record
that
they
had
each
eaten
about
thirty
cakes
well
i
wondered
what
you
were
doing
so
long
but
never
mind
your
cakes
it
s
twenty
minutes
past
six
and
the
table
d
hote
s
on
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
dine
at
the
table
d
hote
flack
cried
why
don
t
you
like
that
and
francie
s
candour
of
appeal
to
their
comrade
s
taste
was
celestial
well
it
isn
t
what
you
must
build
on
when
you
come
to
paris
too
many
flowerpots
and
chickens
well
would
you
like
one
of
these
restaurants
asked
dosson
don
t
care
if
you
show
us
a
good
oh
i
ll
show
you
a
good
one
don
t
you
flack
s
tone
was
ever
that
of
keeping
the
poor
gentleman
mildly
but
firmly
in
his
place
well
you
ve
got
to
order
the
dinner
then
said
francie
well
you
ll
see
how
i
could
do
it
he
towered
over
her
in
the
pride
of
this
feat
he
has
got
an
interest
in
some
place
delia
declared
he
has
taken
us
to
ever
so
many
stores
where
he
gets
his
well
i
d
pay
you
to
take
them
round
said
dosson
and
with
much
agreeable
trifling
of
this
kind
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
sally
forth
for
the
evening
meal
under
flack
s
guidance
if
he
had
easily
convinced
them
on
this
occasion
that
that
was
a
more
original
proceeding
than
worrying
those
old
bones
as
he
called
it
at
the
hotel
he
convinced
them
of
other
things
besides
in
the
course
of
the
following
month
and
by
the
aid
of
profuse
attentions
what
he
mainly
made
clear
to
them
was
that
it
was
really
most
kind
of
a
young
man
who
had
so
many
big
things
on
his
mind
to
find
sympathy
for
questions
for
issues
he
used
to
call
them
that
could
occupy
the
telegraph
and
the
press
so
little
as
theirs
he
came
every
day
to
set
them
in
the
right
path
pointing
out
its
charms
to
them
in
a
way
that
made
them
feel
how
much
they
had
been
in
the
wrong
it
made
them
feel
indeed
that
they
didn
t
know
anything
about
anything
even
about
such
a
matter
as
ordering
shoes
an
art
in
which
they
had
vaguely
supposed
themselves
rather
strong
he
had
in
fact
great
knowledge
which
was
wonderfully
various
and
he
knew
as
many
people
as
they
knew
few
he
had
appointments
very
often
with
celebrities
for
every
hour
of
the
day
and
memoranda
sometimes
in
shorthand
on
tablets
with
elastic
straps
with
which
he
dazzled
the
simple
folk
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
whose
social
life
of
narrow
range
consisted
mainly
in
reading
the
lists
of
americans
who
registered
at
the
bankers
and
at
galignani
s
delia
dosson
in
particular
had
a
trick
of
poring
solemnly
over
these
records
which
exasperated
flack
who
skimmed
them
and
found
what
he
wanted
in
the
flash
of
an
eye
she
kept
the
others
waiting
while
she
satisfied
herself
that
and
rosenheim
and
miss
cora
rosenheim
and
master
samuel
rosenheim
had
left
for
flack
was
wonderful
on
all
occasions
in
finding
what
he
wanted
which
as
we
know
was
what
he
believed
the
public
wanted
and
delia
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
with
whom
he
was
sometimes
a
little
sharp
he
had
embraced
from
the
first
the
idea
that
she
was
his
enemy
and
he
alluded
to
it
with
almost
tiresome
frequency
though
always
in
a
humorous
fearless
strain
even
more
than
by
her
fashion
of
hanging
over
the
registers
she
provoked
him
by
appearing
to
find
their
little
party
not
sufficient
to
itself
by
wishing
as
he
expressed
it
to
work
in
new
stuff
he
might
have
been
easy
however
for
he
had
sufficient
chance
to
observe
how
it
was
always
the
fate
of
the
dossons
to
miss
their
friends
they
were
continually
looking
out
for
reunions
and
combinations
that
never
came
off
hearing
that
people
had
been
in
paris
only
after
they
had
gone
away
or
feeling
convinced
that
they
were
there
but
not
to
be
found
through
their
not
having
registered
or
wondering
whether
they
should
overtake
them
if
they
should
go
to
dresden
and
then
making
up
their
minds
to
start
for
dresden
only
to
learn
at
the
eleventh
hour
through
some
accident
that
the
hunted
game
had
left
for
biarritz
even
as
the
rosenheims
for
brussels
we
know
plenty
of
people
if
we
could
only
come
across
them
delia
had
more
than
once
observed
she
scanned
the
continent
with
a
wondering
baffled
gaze
and
talked
of
the
unsatisfactory
way
in
which
friends
at
home
would
write
out
that
other
friends
were
somewhere
in
she
expressed
the
wish
that
such
correspondents
as
that
might
be
in
a
place
that
was
not
at
all
vague
two
or
three
times
people
had
called
at
the
hotel
when
they
were
out
and
had
left
cards
for
them
without
an
address
and
superscribed
with
some
mocking
dash
of
the
pencil
so
sorry
to
miss
you
or
off
the
girl
sat
looking
at
these
cards
handling
them
and
turning
them
over
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
she
produced
them
days
afterwards
brooding
upon
them
afresh
as
if
they
were
a
mystic
clue
george
flack
generally
knew
where
they
were
the
people
who
were
somewhere
in
such
knowledge
came
to
him
by
a
kind
of
intuition
by
the
voices
of
the
air
by
indefinable
and
unteachable
processes
but
he
held
his
peace
on
purpose
he
didn
t
want
any
outsiders
he
thought
their
little
party
just
right
dosson
s
place
in
the
scheme
of
providence
was
to
go
with
delia
while
he
himself
went
with
francie
and
nothing
would
have
induced
george
flack
to
disfigure
that
equation
the
young
man
was
professionally
so
occupied
with
other
people
s
affairs
that
it
should
doubtless
be
mentioned
to
his
praise
that
he
still
managed
to
have
affairs
or
at
least
an
affair
of
his
own
that
affair
was
francie
dosson
and
he
was
pleased
to
perceive
how
little
she
cared
what
had
become
of
and
rosenheim
and
master
samuel
and
miss
cora
he
counted
all
the
things
she
didn
t
care
about
her
soft
inadvertent
eyes
helped
him
to
do
that
and
they
footed
up
so
as
he
would
have
said
that
they
gave
him
the
rich
sense
of
a
free
field
if
she
had
so
few
interests
there
was
the
greater
possibility
that
a
young
man
of
bold
conceptions
and
cheerful
manners
might
become
one
she
had
usually
the
air
of
waiting
for
something
with
a
pretty
listlessness
or
an
amused
resignation
while
tender
shy
indefinite
little
fancies
hummed
in
her
brain
thus
she
would
perhaps
recognise
in
him
the
reward
of
patience
george
flack
was
aware
that
he
exposed
his
friends
to
considerable
fatigue
he
brought
them
back
pale
and
taciturn
from
suburban
excursions
and
from
wanderings
often
rather
aimless
and
casual
among
the
boulevards
and
avenues
of
the
town
he
regarded
them
at
such
times
with
complacency
however
for
these
were
hours
of
diminished
resistance
he
had
an
idea
that
he
should
be
able
eventually
to
circumvent
delia
if
he
only
could
catch
her
some
day
sufficiently
that
is
physically
prostrate
he
liked
to
make
them
all
feel
helpless
and
dependent
and
this
was
not
difficult
with
people
who
were
so
modest
and
artless
so
unconscious
of
the
boundless
power
of
wealth
sentiment
in
our
young
man
was
not
a
scruple
nor
a
source
of
weakness
but
he
thought
it
really
touching
the
little
these
good
people
knew
of
what
they
could
do
with
their
money
they
had
in
their
hands
a
weapon
of
infinite
range
and
yet
were
incapable
of
firing
a
shot
for
themselves
they
had
a
sort
of
social
humility
it
appeared
never
to
have
occurred
to
them
that
added
to
their
loveliness
their
money
gave
them
a
value
this
used
to
strike
george
flack
on
certain
occasions
when
he
came
back
to
find
them
in
the
places
where
he
had
dropped
them
while
he
rushed
off
to
give
a
turn
to
one
of
his
screws
they
never
played
him
false
never
wearied
of
waiting
always
sat
patient
and
submissive
usually
at
a
cafe
to
which
he
had
introduced
them
or
in
a
row
of
chairs
on
the
boulevard
on
the
level
expanse
of
the
tuileries
or
in
the
champs
elysees
he
introduced
them
to
many
cafes
in
different
parts
of
paris
being
careful
to
choose
those
which
in
his
view
young
ladies
might
frequent
with
propriety
and
there
were
two
or
three
in
the
neighbourhood
of
their
hotel
where
they
became
frequent
and
familiar
figures
as
the
late
spring
days
grew
warmer
and
brighter
they
mainly
camped
out
on
the
terrace
amid
the
array
of
small
tables
at
the
door
of
the
establishment
where
flack
on
the
return
could
descry
them
from
afar
at
their
post
and
in
the
very
same
postures
to
which
he
had
appointed
them
they
complained
of
no
satiety
in
watching
the
movement
of
the
parisian
streets
and
if
some
of
the
features
in
the
panorama
were
base
they
were
only
so
in
a
version
that
the
social
culture
of
our
friends
was
incapable
of
supplying
george
flack
considered
that
he
was
rendering
a
positive
service
to
dosson
wouldn
t
the
old
gentleman
have
sat
all
day
in
the
court
anyway
and
wasn
t
the
boulevard
better
than
the
court
it
was
his
theory
too
that
he
nattered
and
caressed
miss
francie
s
father
for
there
was
no
one
to
whom
he
had
furnished
more
copious
details
about
the
affairs
the
projects
and
prospects
of
the
reverberator
he
had
left
no
doubt
in
the
old
gentleman
s
mind
as
to
the
race
he
himself
intended
to
run
and
dosson
used
to
say
to
him
every
day
the
first
thing
well
where
have
you
got
to
now
quite
as
if
he
took
a
real
interest
george
flack
reported
his
interviews
that
is
his
reportings
to
which
delia
and
francie
gave
attention
only
in
case
they
knew
something
of
the
persons
on
whom
the
young
emissary
of
the
reverberator
had
conferred
this
distinction
whereas
dosson
listened
with
his
tolerant
interposition
of
is
that
so
and
well
that
s
good
just
as
submissively
when
he
heard
of
the
celebrity
in
question
for
the
first
time
in
conversation
with
his
daughters
flack
was
frequently
the
theme
though
introduced
much
more
by
the
young
ladies
than
by
himself
and
especially
by
delia
who
announced
at
an
early
period
that
she
knew
what
he
wanted
and
that
it
wasn
t
in
the
least
what
she
wanted
she
amplified
this
statement
very
soon
at
least
as
regards
her
interpretation
of
flack
s
designs
a
certain
mystery
still
hung
about
her
own
which
as
she
intimated
had
much
more
to
recommend
them
delia
s
vision
of
the
danger
as
well
as
the
advantage
of
being
a
pretty
girl
was
closely
connected
as
was
natural
with
the
idea
of
an
engagement
this
idea
was
in
a
manner
complete
in
itself
her
imagination
failed
in
the
oddest
way
to
carry
it
into
the
next
stage
she
wanted
her
sister
to
be
engaged
but
wanted
her
not
at
all
to
be
married
and
had
clearly
never
made
up
her
mind
as
to
how
francie
was
to
enjoy
both
the
peril
and
the
shelter
it
was
a
secret
source
of
humiliation
to
her
that
there
had
as
yet
to
her
knowledge
been
no
one
with
whom
her
sister
had
exchanged
vows
if
her
conviction
on
this
subject
could
have
expressed
itself
intelligibly
it
would
have
given
you
a
glimpse
of
a
droll
state
of
mind
a
dim
theory
that
a
bright
girl
ought
to
be
able
to
try
successive
aspirants
delia
s
conception
of
what
such
a
trial
might
consist
of
was
strangely
innocent
it
was
made
up
of
calls
and
walks
and
and
above
all
of
being
in
the
light
of
these
exhibitions
the
theme
of
tongues
and
subject
to
the
great
imputation
it
had
never
in
life
occurred
to
her
withal
that
a
succession
of
lovers
or
just
even
a
repetition
of
experiments
may
have
anything
to
say
to
a
young
lady
s
delicacy
she
felt
herself
a
born
old
maid
and
never
dreamed
of
a
lover
of
her
own
he
would
have
been
dreadfully
in
her
way
but
she
dreamed
of
love
as
something
in
its
nature
essentially
refined
all
the
same
she
discriminated
it
did
lead
to
something
after
all
and
she
desired
that
for
francie
it
shouldn
t
lead
to
a
union
with
flack
she
looked
at
such
a
union
under
the
influence
of
that
other
view
which
she
kept
as
yet
to
herself
but
was
prepared
to
produce
so
soon
as
the
right
occasion
should
come
up
giving
her
sister
to
understand
that
she
would
never
speak
to
her
again
should
this
young
man
be
allowed
to
suppose
which
was
where
she
always
paused
plunging
again
into
impressive
reticence
to
suppose
what
francie
would
ask
as
if
she
were
totally
unacquainted
which
indeed
she
really
was
with
the
suppositions
of
young
men
well
you
ll
see
when
he
begins
to
say
things
you
won
t
like
this
sounded
ominous
on
delia
s
part
yet
her
anxiety
was
really
but
thin
otherwise
she
would
have
risen
against
the
custom
adopted
by
flack
of
perpetually
coming
round
she
would
have
given
her
attention
though
it
struggled
in
general
unsuccessfully
with
all
this
side
of
their
life
to
some
prompt
means
of
getting
away
from
paris
she
expressed
to
her
father
what
in
her
view
the
correspondent
of
the
reverberator
was
after
but
without
it
must
be
added
gaining
from
him
the
sense
of
it
as
a
connexion
in
which
he
could
be
greatly
worked
up
this
indeed
was
not
of
importance
thanks
to
her
inner
faith
that
francie
would
never
really
do
anything
that
is
would
never
really
like
anything
her
nearest
relatives
didn
t
like
her
sister
s
docility
was
a
great
comfort
to
delia
the
more
that
she
herself
taking
it
always
for
granted
was
the
first
to
profit
by
it
she
liked
and
disliked
certain
things
much
more
than
her
junior
did
either
and
francie
cultivated
the
convenience
of
her
reasons
having
so
few
of
her
own
they
served
delia
s
reasons
for
dosson
as
well
so
that
francie
was
not
guilty
of
any
particular
irreverence
in
regarding
her
sister
rather
than
her
father
as
the
controller
of
her
fate
a
fate
was
rather
an
unwieldy
and
terrible
treasure
which
it
relieved
her
that
some
kind
person
should
undertake
to
administer
delia
had
somehow
got
hold
of
hers
first
before
even
her
father
and
ever
so
much
before
flack
and
it
lay
with
delia
to
make
any
change
she
couldn
t
have
accepted
any
gentleman
as
a
party
to
an
engagement
which
was
somehow
as
far
as
her
imagination
went
without
reference
to
delia
any
more
than
she
could
have
done
up
her
hair
without
a
glass
the
only
action
taken
by
dosson
on
his
elder
daughter
s
admonitions
was
to
convert
the
general
issue
as
flack
would
have
called
it
to
a
theme
for
daily
pleasantry
he
was
fond
in
his
intercourse
with
his
children
of
some
small
usual
joke
some
humorous
refrain
and
what
could
have
been
more
in
the
line
of
true
domestic
sport
than
a
little
gentle
but
unintermitted
raillery
on
francie
s
conquest
flack
s
attributive
intentions
became
a
theme
of
indulgent
parental
chaff
and
the
girl
was
neither
dazzled
nor
annoyed
by
the
freedom
of
all
this
tribute
well
he
has
told
us
about
half
we
know
she
used
to
reply
with
an
air
of
the
judicious
that
the
undetected
observer
i
am
perpetually
moved
to
invoke
would
have
found
indescribably
quaint
among
the
items
of
knowledge
for
which
they
were
indebted
to
him
floated
the
fact
that
this
was
the
very
best
time
in
the
young
lady
s
life
to
have
her
portrait
painted
and
the
best
place
in
the
world
to
have
it
done
well
also
that
he
knew
a
lovely
artist
a
young
american
of
extraordinary
talent
who
would
be
delighted
to
undertake
the
job
he
led
his
trio
to
this
gentleman
s
studio
where
they
saw
several
pictures
that
opened
to
them
the
strange
gates
of
mystification
francie
protested
that
she
didn
t
want
to
be
done
in
that
style
and
delia
declared
that
she
would
as
soon
have
her
sister
shown
up
in
a
magic
lantern
they
had
had
the
fortune
not
to
find
waterlow
at
home
so
that
they
were
free
to
express
themselves
and
the
pictures
were
shown
them
by
his
servant
they
looked
at
them
as
they
looked
at
bonnets
and
confections
when
they
went
to
expensive
shops
as
if
it
were
a
question
among
so
many
specimens
of
the
style
and
colour
they
would
choose
waterlow
s
productions
took
their
place
for
the
most
part
in
the
category
of
those
creations
known
to
ladies
as
frights
and
our
friends
retired
with
the
lowest
opinion
of
the
young
american
master
george
flack
told
them
however
that
they
couldn
t
get
out
of
it
inasmuch
as
he
had
already
written
home
to
the
reverberator
that
francie
was
to
sit
they
accepted
this
somehow
as
a
kind
of
supernatural
sign
that
she
would
have
to
for
they
believed
everything
they
ever
heard
quoted
from
a
newspaper
moreover
flack
explained
to
them
that
it
would
be
idiotic
to
miss
such
an
opportunity
to
get
something
at
once
precious
and
cheap
for
it
was
well
known
that
impressionism
was
going
to
be
the
art
of
the
future
and
charles
waterlow
was
a
rising
impressionist
it
was
a
new
system
altogether
and
the
latest
improvement
in
art
they
didn
t
want
to
go
back
they
wanted
to
go
forward
and
he
would
give
them
an
article
that
would
fetch
five
times
the
money
in
about
five
years
which
somehow
as
he
put
it
seemed
a
very
short
time
though
it
would
have
seemed
immense
for
anything
else
they
were
not
in
search
of
a
bargain
but
they
allowed
themselves
to
be
inoculated
with
any
reason
they
thought
would
be
characteristic
of
informed
people
and
he
even
convinced
them
after
a
little
that
when
once
they
had
got
used
to
impressionism
they
would
never
look
at
anything
else
waterlow
was
the
man
among
the
young
and
he
had
no
interest
in
praising
him
because
he
was
not
a
personal
friend
his
reputation
was
advancing
with
strides
and
any
one
with
any
sense
would
want
to
secure
something
before
the
rush
iii
the
young
ladies
consented
to
return
to
the
avenue
des
villiers
and
this
time
they
found
the
celebrity
of
the
future
he
was
smoking
cigarettes
with
a
friend
while
coffee
was
served
to
the
two
gentlemen
it
was
just
after
luncheon
on
a
vast
divan
covered
with
scrappy
oriental
rugs
and
cushions
it
looked
francie
thought
as
if
the
artist
had
set
up
a
in
a
corner
he
struck
her
as
very
pleasant
and
it
may
be
mentioned
without
circumlocution
that
the
young
lady
ushered
in
by
the
vulgar
american
reporter
whom
he
didn
t
like
and
who
had
already
come
too
often
to
his
studio
to
pick
up
glimpses
the
painter
wondered
how
in
the
world
he
had
picked
her
up
this
charming
candidate
for
portraiture
rose
on
the
spot
before
charles
waterlow
as
a
precious
model
she
made
it
may
further
be
declared
quite
the
same
impression
on
the
gentleman
who
was
with
him
and
who
never
took
his
eyes
off
her
while
her
own
rested
afresh
on
several
finished
and
unfinished
canvases
this
gentleman
asked
of
his
friend
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
the
favour
of
an
introduction
to
her
in
consequence
of
which
francie
learned
that
his
name
she
thought
it
singular
was
gaston
probert
probert
was
a
smiling
youth
who
fingered
the
points
of
his
moustache
he
was
represented
by
waterlow
as
an
american
but
he
pronounced
the
american
language
so
at
least
it
seemed
to
francie
as
if
it
had
been
french
after
she
had
quitted
the
studio
with
delia
and
flack
her
father
on
this
occasion
not
being
of
the
party
the
two
young
men
falling
back
on
their
divan
broke
into
expressions
of
aesthetic
rapture
gave
it
to
each
other
that
the
girl
had
qualities
oh
but
qualities
and
a
charm
of
line
they
remained
there
an
hour
studying
these
rare
properties
through
the
smoke
of
their
cigarettes
you
would
have
gathered
from
their
conversation
though
as
regards
much
of
it
only
perhaps
with
the
aid
of
a
grammar
and
dictionary
that
the
young
lady
had
been
endowed
with
plastic
treasures
that
is
with
physical
graces
of
the
highest
order
of
which
she
was
evidently
quite
unconscious
before
this
however
waterlow
had
come
to
an
understanding
with
his
visitors
it
had
been
settled
that
miss
francina
should
sit
for
him
at
his
first
hour
of
leisure
unfortunately
that
hour
hovered
before
him
as
still
rather
distant
he
was
unable
to
make
a
definite
appointment
he
had
sitters
on
his
hands
he
had
at
least
three
portraits
to
finish
before
going
to
spain
he
adverted
with
bitterness
to
the
journey
to
spain
a
little
excursion
laid
out
precisely
with
his
friend
probert
for
the
last
weeks
of
the
spring
the
first
of
the
southern
summer
the
time
of
the
long
days
and
the
real
light
gaston
probert
his
regrets
for
though
he
had
no
business
with
miss
francina
whose
name
he
yet
liked
he
also
wanted
to
see
her
again
they
to
give
up
spain
they
had
after
all
been
there
before
so
that
waterlow
might
take
the
girl
in
hand
without
delay
the
moment
he
had
knocked
off
his
present
work
this
amendment
broke
down
indeed
for
other
considerations
came
up
and
the
artist
resigned
himself
to
the
arrangement
on
which
the
young
women
had
quitted
him
he
thought
it
so
characteristic
of
their
nationality
that
they
should
settle
a
matter
of
that
sort
for
themselves
this
was
simply
that
they
should
come
back
in
the
autumn
when
he
should
be
comparatively
free
then
there
would
be
a
margin
and
they
might
all
take
their
time
at
present
before
long
by
the
time
he
should
be
ready
the
question
of
the
pretty
one
s
leaving
paris
for
the
summer
would
be
sure
to
rise
and
that
would
be
a
tiresome
interruption
the
pretty
one
clearly
liked
paris
she
had
no
plans
for
the
autumn
and
only
wanted
a
reason
to
come
back
about
the
twentieth
of
september
waterlow
remarked
humorously
that
she
evidently
bossed
the
shop
meanwhile
before
starting
for
spain
he
would
see
her
as
often
as
possible
his
eye
would
take
possession
of
her
his
companion
envied
his
eye
even
expressed
jealousy
of
his
eye
it
was
perhaps
as
a
step
towards
establishing
his
right
to
jealousy
that
probert
left
a
card
upon
the
miss
dossons
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
having
first
ascertained
that
such
a
proceeding
would
not
by
the
young
american
sisters
be
regarded
as
an
unwarrantable
liberty
gaston
probert
was
an
american
who
had
never
been
in
america
and
was
obliged
to
take
counsel
on
such
an
emergency
as
that
he
knew
that
in
paris
young
men
didn
t
call
at
hotels
on
blameless
maids
but
he
also
knew
that
blameless
maids
unattended
by
a
parent
didn
t
visit
young
men
in
studios
and
he
had
no
guide
no
light
he
could
trust
none
save
the
wisdom
of
his
friend
waterlow
which
was
for
the
most
part
communicated
to
him
in
a
derisive
and
misleading
form
waterlow
who
was
after
all
himself
an
ornament
of
the
french
and
the
very
french
school
jeered
at
the
other
s
want
of
native
instinct
at
the
way
he
never
knew
by
which
end
to
take
hold
of
a
compatriot
poor
probert
was
obliged
to
confess
to
his
terrible
paucity
of
practice
and
that
in
the
great
medley
of
aliens
and
brothers
and
even
more
of
sisters
he
couldn
t
tell
which
was
which
he
would
have
had
a
country
and
countrymen
to
say
nothing
of
countrywomen
if
he
could
but
that
matter
had
never
been
properly
settled
for
him
and
it
s
one
there
s
ever
a
great
difficulty
in
a
gentleman
s
settling
for
himself
born
in
paris
he
had
been
brought
up
altogether
on
french
lines
in
a
family
that
french
society
had
irrecoverably
absorbed
his
father
a
carolinian
and
a
catholic
was
a
gallomaniac
of
the
old
american
type
his
three
sisters
had
married
frenchmen
and
one
of
them
lived
in
brittany
while
the
others
were
ostensibly
seated
in
touraine
his
only
brother
had
fallen
during
the
terrible
year
in
defence
of
their
adopted
country
yet
gaston
though
he
had
had
an
old
legitimist
marquis
for
godfather
was
not
legally
one
of
its
children
his
mother
had
on
her
extorted
from
him
the
promise
that
he
wouldn
t
take
service
in
its
armies
she
considered
after
the
death
of
her
elder
son
gaston
in
had
been
a
boy
of
ten
that
the
family
had
sacrificed
enough
on
the
altar
of
sympathy
the
young
man
therefore
between
two
stools
had
no
clear
he
wanted
to
be
as
american
as
he
could
and
yet
not
less
french
than
he
was
he
was
afraid
to
give
up
the
little
that
he
was
and
find
that
what
he
might
be
was
less
he
shrank
from
a
flying
leap
which
might
drop
him
in
the
middle
of
the
sea
at
the
same
time
he
thought
himself
sure
that
the
only
way
to
know
how
it
feels
to
be
an
american
is
to
try
it
and
he
had
had
many
a
purpose
of
making
the
pious
pilgrimage
his
family
however
had
been
so
completely
gallicised
that
the
affairs
of
each
member
of
it
were
the
affairs
of
all
the
rest
and
his
father
his
sisters
and
his
had
not
yet
begun
sufficiently
to
regard
this
scheme
as
their
own
for
him
to
feel
it
substantially
his
it
was
a
family
in
which
there
was
no
individual
but
only
a
collective
property
meanwhile
he
tried
as
i
say
by
affronting
minor
perils
and
especially
by
going
a
good
deal
to
see
charles
waterlow
in
the
avenue
de
villiers
whom
he
believed
to
be
his
dearest
friend
formed
for
his
affection
by
monsieur
carolus
he
had
an
idea
that
in
this
manner
he
kept
himself
in
touch
with
his
countrymen
and
he
had
never
pitched
his
endeavour
so
high
as
in
leaving
that
card
on
the
misses
dosson
he
was
in
search
of
freshness
but
he
needn
t
have
gone
far
he
would
have
had
but
to
turn
his
lantern
on
his
own
young
breast
to
find
a
considerable
store
of
it
like
many
of
his
dawdling
coaevals
he
gave
much
attention
to
art
lived
as
much
as
possible
in
that
more
select
world
where
it
is
a
positive
duty
not
to
bustle
to
make
up
for
his
want
of
talent
he
espoused
the
talent
of
others
that
is
of
several
and
was
as
sensitive
and
conscientious
about
them
as
he
might
have
been
about
himself
he
defended
certain
of
waterlow
s
purples
and
greens
as
he
would
have
defended
his
own
honour
and
there
was
a
genius
or
two
not
yet
fully
acclaimed
by
the
vulgar
in
regard
to
whom
he
had
convictions
that
belonged
almost
to
the
undiscussable
part
of
life
he
had
not
for
himself
any
very
high
sense
of
performance
but
what
kept
it
down
particularly
was
his
untractable
hand
the
fact
that
such
as
they
were
waterlow
s
purples
and
greens
for
instance
were
far
beyond
him
if
he
hadn
t
failed
there
other
failures
wouldn
t
have
mattered
not
even
that
of
not
having
a
country
and
it
was
on
the
occasion
of
his
friend
s
agreement
to
paint
that
strange
lovely
girl
whom
he
liked
so
much
and
whose
companions
he
didn
t
like
that
he
felt
supremely
without
a
vocation
freshness
was
in
her
at
least
if
he
had
only
been
organised
for
catching
it
he
prayed
earnestly
in
relation
to
such
a
triumph
for
a
providential
of
waterlow
s
sense
of
that
source
of
charm
if
waterlow
had
a
fault
it
was
that
his
freshnesses
were
sometimes
too
crude
he
avenged
himself
for
the
artist
s
profanation
of
his
first
attempt
to
approach
miss
francie
by
indulging
at
the
end
of
another
week
in
a
second
he
went
about
six
o
clock
when
he
supposed
she
would
have
returned
from
her
day
s
wanderings
and
his
prudence
was
rewarded
by
the
sight
of
the
young
lady
sitting
in
the
court
of
the
hotel
with
her
father
and
sister
dosson
was
new
to
gaston
probert
but
the
young
man
might
have
been
a
naturalist
visiting
a
rank
country
with
a
net
of
such
narrow
meshes
as
to
let
no
creature
of
the
air
escape
the
little
party
was
as
usual
expecting
flack
at
any
moment
and
they
had
collected
downstairs
so
that
he
might
pick
them
up
easily
they
had
on
the
first
floor
an
expensive
parlour
decorated
in
white
and
gold
with
sofas
of
crimson
damask
but
there
was
something
lonely
in
that
grandeur
and
the
place
had
become
mainly
a
receptacle
for
their
tall
trunks
with
a
paper
of
chocolates
or
marrons
glaces
on
every
table
after
young
probert
s
first
call
his
name
was
often
on
the
lips
of
the
simple
trio
and
dosson
grew
still
more
jocose
making
nothing
of
a
secret
of
his
perception
that
francie
hit
the
bull
every
waterlow
had
returned
their
visit
but
that
was
rather
a
matter
of
course
since
it
was
they
who
had
gone
after
him
they
had
not
gone
after
the
other
one
it
was
he
who
had
come
after
them
when
he
entered
the
hotel
as
they
sat
there
this
pursuit
and
its
probable
motive
became
startlingly
vivid
delia
had
taken
the
matter
much
more
seriously
than
her
father
she
said
there
was
ever
so
much
she
wanted
to
find
out
she
mused
upon
these
mysteries
visibly
but
with
no
great
advance
and
she
appealed
for
assistance
to
george
flack
with
a
candour
which
he
appreciated
and
returned
if
he
really
knew
anything
he
ought
to
know
at
least
who
probert
was
and
she
spoke
as
if
it
would
be
in
the
natural
course
that
as
soon
as
he
should
find
out
he
would
put
it
for
them
somehow
into
his
paper
flack
promised
to
nose
round
he
said
the
best
plan
would
be
that
the
results
should
come
back
to
her
in
the
reverberator
it
might
have
been
gathered
from
him
that
the
people
over
there
in
other
words
the
mass
of
their
compatriots
wouldn
t
be
unpersuadable
that
they
wanted
about
a
column
on
probert
his
researches
were
to
prove
none
the
less
fruitless
for
in
spite
of
the
vivid
fact
the
girl
was
able
to
give
him
as
a
the
fact
that
their
new
acquaintance
had
spent
his
whole
life
in
paris
the
young
journalist
couldn
t
scare
up
a
single
person
who
had
even
heard
of
him
he
had
questioned
up
and
down
and
all
over
the
place
from
the
rue
scribe
to
the
far
end
of
chaillot
and
he
knew
people
who
knew
others
who
knew
every
member
of
the
american
colony
that
select
settled
body
which
haunted
poor
delia
s
imagination
glittered
and
there
in
a
hundred
tormenting
roundabout
glimpses
that
was
where
she
wanted
to
get
francie
as
she
said
to
herself
she
wanted
to
get
her
right
in
there
she
believed
the
members
of
this
society
to
constitute
a
little
kingdom
of
the
blest
and
she
used
to
drive
through
the
avenue
gabriel
the
rue
de
marignan
and
the
wide
vistas
which
radiate
from
the
arch
of
triumph
and
are
always
changing
their
names
on
purpose
to
send
up
wistful
glances
to
the
windows
she
had
learned
that
all
this
was
the
happy
quarter
of
the
enviable
but
unapproachable
colonists
she
saw
these
privileged
mortals
as
she
supposed
in
almost
every
victoria
that
made
a
languid
lady
with
a
pretty
head
dash
past
her
and
she
had
no
idea
how
little
honour
this
theory
sometimes
did
her
expatriated
countrywomen
her
plan
was
already
made
to
be
on
the
field
again
the
next
winter
and
take
it
up
seriously
this
question
of
getting
francie
in
when
flack
remarked
that
young
probert
s
net
couldn
t
be
either
the
rose
or
anything
near
it
since
they
had
shed
no
petal
at
any
general
shake
on
the
path
of
the
oldest
inhabitant
delia
had
a
flash
of
inspiration
an
intellectual
flight
that
she
herself
didn
t
measure
at
the
time
she
asked
if
that
didn
t
perhaps
prove
on
the
contrary
quite
the
opposite
that
they
were
just
the
cream
and
beyond
all
others
wasn
t
there
a
kind
of
inner
very
far
in
circle
and
wouldn
t
they
be
somewhere
about
the
centre
of
that
george
flack
almost
quivered
at
this
weird
hit
as
from
one
of
the
blind
for
he
guessed
on
the
spot
that
delia
dosson
had
as
he
would
have
said
got
there
why
do
you
mean
one
of
those
families
that
have
worked
down
so
far
you
can
t
find
where
they
went
in
that
was
the
phrase
in
which
he
recognised
the
truth
of
the
girl
s
grope
delia
s
fixed
eyes
assented
and
after
a
moment
of
cogitation
george
flack
broke
out
that
s
the
kind
of
family
we
want
to
handle
well
perhaps
they
won
t
want
to
be
handled
delia
had
returned
with
a
still
wilder
and
more
remarkable
play
of
inspiration
you
had
better
find
out
she
had
added
the
chance
to
find
out
might
have
seemed
to
present
itself
after
probert
had
walked
in
that
confiding
way
into
the
hotel
for
his
arrival
had
been
followed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
by
that
of
the
representative
of
the
reverberator
gaston
had
liked
the
way
they
treated
him
though
demonstrative
it
was
not
artificial
dosson
had
said
they
had
been
hoping
he
would
come
round
again
and
delia
had
remarked
that
she
supposed
he
had
had
quite
a
journey
paris
was
so
big
and
had
urged
his
acceptance
of
a
glass
of
wine
or
a
cup
of
tea
mentioning
that
that
wasn
t
the
place
where
they
usually
received
she
liked
to
hear
herself
talk
of
receiving
she
led
the
party
up
to
her
saloon
where
they
should
be
so
much
more
private
she
liked
also
to
hear
herself
talk
of
privacy
they
sat
on
the
red
silk
chairs
and
she
hoped
probert
would
at
least
taste
a
sugared
chestnut
or
a
chocolate
and
when
he
declined
pleading
the
imminence
of
the
she
sighed
well
i
suppose
you
re
so
used
to
them
to
the
best
living
so
long
over
the
allusion
to
the
led
dosson
to
the
frank
hope
that
he
would
go
round
and
dine
with
them
without
ceremony
they
were
expecting
a
friend
he
generally
settled
it
for
them
who
was
coming
to
take
them
round
and
then
we
re
going
to
the
circus
francie
said
speaking
for
the
first
time
if
she
had
not
spoken
before
she
had
done
something
still
more
to
the
purpose
she
had
removed
any
shade
of
doubt
that
might
have
lingered
in
the
young
man
s
spirit
as
to
her
charm
of
line
he
was
aware
that
the
education
of
paris
acting
upon
a
natural
aptitude
had
opened
him
much
rendered
him
perhaps
even
morbidly
sensitive
to
impressions
of
this
order
the
society
of
artists
the
talk
of
studios
the
attentive
study
of
beautiful
works
the
sight
of
a
thousand
forms
of
curious
research
and
experiment
had
produced
in
his
mind
a
new
sense
the
exercise
of
which
was
a
conscious
enjoyment
and
the
supreme
gratification
of
which
on
several
occasions
had
given
him
as
many
indelible
memories
he
had
once
said
to
his
friend
waterlow
i
don
t
know
whether
it
s
a
confession
of
a
very
poor
life
but
the
most
important
things
that
have
happened
to
me
in
this
world
have
been
simply
half
a
dozen
visual
impressions
things
that
happened
through
my
ah
malheureux
you
re
lost
the
painter
had
exclaimed
in
answer
to
this
and
without
even
taking
the
trouble
to
explain
his
ominous
speech
gaston
probert
however
had
not
been
frightened
by
it
and
he
continued
to
be
thankful
for
the
sensitive
plate
that
nature
had
lodged
in
his
brain
and
that
culture
had
brought
to
so
high
a
polish
the
experience
of
the
eye
was
doubtless
not
everything
but
it
was
so
much
gained
so
much
saved
in
a
world
in
which
other
treasures
were
apt
to
slip
through
one
s
fingers
and
above
all
it
had
the
merit
that
so
many
things
gave
it
and
that
nothing
could
take
it
away
he
had
noted
in
a
moment
how
straight
francie
dosson
gave
it
and
now
seeing
her
a
second
time
he
felt
her
promote
it
in
a
degree
which
made
acquaintance
with
her
one
of
those
important
facts
of
which
he
had
spoken
to
charles
waterlow
it
was
in
the
case
of
such
an
accident
as
this
that
he
felt
the
value
of
his
parisian
education
it
made
him
revel
in
his
modern
sense
it
was
therefore
not
directly
the
prospect
of
the
circus
that
induced
him
to
accept
dosson
s
invitation
nor
was
it
even
the
charm
exerted
by
the
girl
s
appearing
in
the
few
words
she
uttered
to
appeal
to
him
for
herself
it
was
his
feeling
that
on
the
edge
of
the
glittering
ring
her
type
would
attach
him
to
her
to
her
only
and
that
if
he
knew
it
was
rare
she
herself
didn
t
he
liked
to
be
intensely
conscious
but
liked
others
not
to
be
it
seemed
to
him
at
this
moment
after
he
had
told
dosson
he
should
be
delighted
to
spend
the
evening
with
them
that
he
was
indeed
trying
hard
to
measure
how
it
would
feel
to
recover
the
national
tie
he
had
jumped
on
the
ship
he
was
pitching
away
to
the
west
he
had
led
his
sister
mme
de
brecourt
to
expect
that
he
would
dine
with
her
she
was
having
a
little
party
so
that
if
she
could
see
the
people
to
whom
without
a
scruple
with
a
quick
sense
of
refreshment
and
freedom
he
now
sacrificed
her
he
knew
who
was
coming
to
his
sister
s
in
the
place
beauvau
mme
d
outreville
and
de
grospre
old
courageau
mme
de
drives
lord
and
lady
trantum
mile
de
saintonge
but
he
was
fascinated
by
the
idea
of
the
contrast
between
what
he
preferred
and
what
he
gave
up
his
life
had
long
been
wanting
painfully
wanting
in
the
element
of
contrast
and
here
was
a
chance
to
bring
it
in
he
saw
it
come
in
powerfully
with
flack
after
miss
dosson
had
proposed
they
should
walk
off
without
their
initiator
her
father
didn
t
favour
this
suggestion
he
said
we
want
a
double
good
dinner
and
flack
has
got
to
order
upon
this
delia
had
asked
the
visitor
if
he
couldn
t
order
a
frenchman
like
him
and
francie
had
interrupted
before
he
could
answer
the
question
well
are
you
a
frenchman
that
s
just
the
point
ain
t
it
gaston
probert
replied
that
he
had
no
wish
but
to
be
a
citizen
of
her
country
and
the
elder
sister
asked
him
if
he
knew
many
americans
in
paris
he
was
obliged
to
confess
he
knew
almost
none
but
hastened
to
add
he
was
eager
to
go
on
now
he
had
taken
such
a
charming
start
oh
we
ain
t
anything
if
you
mean
that
delia
said
if
you
go
on
you
ll
go
on
beyond
we
ain
t
anything
here
my
dear
but
we
re
a
good
deal
at
home
dosson
jocosely
interjected
i
think
we
re
very
nice
anywhere
francie
exclaimed
upon
which
gaston
probert
declared
that
they
were
as
delightful
as
possible
it
was
in
these
amenities
that
george
flack
found
them
engaged
but
there
was
none
the
less
a
certain
eagerness
in
his
greeting
of
the
other
guest
as
if
he
had
it
in
mind
to
ask
him
how
soon
he
could
give
him
half
an
hour
i
hasten
to
add
that
with
the
turn
the
occasion
presently
took
the
correspondent
of
the
reverberator
dropped
the
conception
of
making
the
young
man
talk
for
the
benefit
of
the
subscribers
to
that
journal
they
all
went
out
together
and
the
impulse
to
pick
up
something
usually
so
irresistible
in
george
flack
s
mind
suffered
an
odd
check
he
found
himself
wanting
to
handle
his
fellow
visitor
in
a
sense
other
than
the
professional
probert
talked
very
little
to
francie
but
though
flack
didn
t
know
that
on
a
first
occasion
he
would
have
thought
this
aggressive
even
rather
brutal
he
knew
it
was
for
francie
and
francie
alone
that
the
fifth
member
of
the
party
was
there
he
said
to
himself
suddenly
and
in
perfect
sincerity
that
it
was
a
mean
class
anyway
the
people
for
whom
their
own
country
wasn
t
good
enough
he
didn
t
go
so
far
however
when
they
were
seated
at
the
admirable
establishment
of
durand
in
the
place
de
la
madeleine
as
to
order
a
bad
dinner
to
spite
his
competitor
nor
did
he
to
spoil
this
gentleman
s
amusement
take
uncomfortable
seats
at
the
pretty
circus
in
the
champs
elysees
to
which
at
eight
o
clock
the
company
was
conveyed
it
was
a
drive
of
but
five
minutes
in
a
couple
of
cabs
the
occasion
therefore
was
superficially
smooth
and
he
could
see
that
the
sense
of
being
disagreeable
to
an
american
was
not
needed
to
make
his
nondescript
rival
enjoy
it
that
gentleman
did
indeed
hate
his
crude
accent
and
vulgar
laugh
and
above
all
the
lamblike
submission
to
him
of
their
friends
flack
was
acute
enough
for
an
important
observation
he
cherished
it
and
promised
himself
to
bring
it
to
the
notice
of
his
clinging
charges
their
imperturbable
guest
professed
a
great
desire
to
be
of
service
to
the
young
ladies
to
do
what
would
help
them
to
be
happy
in
paris
but
he
gave
no
hint
of
the
intention
that
would
contribute
most
to
such
a
result
the
bringing
them
in
contact
with
the
other
members
especially
with
the
female
members
of
his
family
george
flack
knew
nothing
about
the
matter
but
he
required
for
purposes
of
argument
that
probert
s
family
should
have
female
members
and
it
was
lucky
for
him
that
his
assumption
was
just
he
grasped
in
advance
the
effect
with
which
he
should
impress
it
on
francie
and
delia
but
notably
on
delia
who
would
then
herself
impress
it
on
francie
that
it
would
be
time
for
their
french
friend
to
talk
when
he
had
brought
his
mother
round
but
he
never
would
they
might
bet
their
pile
on
that
he
never
did
in
the
strange
sequel
having
poor
young
man
no
mother
to
bring
moreover
he
was
quite
mum
as
delia
phrased
it
to
herself
about
mme
de
brecourt
and
mme
de
cliche
such
miss
dosson
learned
from
charles
waterlow
were
the
names
of
his
two
sisters
who
had
houses
in
paris
gleaning
at
the
same
time
the
information
that
one
of
these
ladies
was
a
marquise
and
the
other
a
comtesse
she
was
less
exasperated
by
their
than
flack
had
hoped
and
it
didn
t
prevent
an
excursion
to
dine
at
a
week
after
the
evening
spent
at
the
circus
which
included
both
the
new
admirers
it
also
as
a
matter
of
course
included
flack
for
though
the
party
had
been
proposed
in
the
first
instance
by
charles
waterlow
who
wished
to
multiply
opportunities
for
studying
his
future
sitter
dosson
had
characteristically
constituted
himself
host
and
administrator
with
the
young
journalist
as
his
deputy
he
liked
to
invite
people
and
to
pay
for
them
and
disliked
to
be
invited
and
paid
for
he
was
never
inwardly
content
on
any
occasion
unless
a
great
deal
of
money
was
spent
and
he
could
be
sure
enough
of
the
large
amount
only
when
he
himself
spent
it
he
was
too
simple
for
conceit
or
for
pride
of
purse
but
always
felt
any
arrangements
shabby
and
sneaking
as
to
which
the
expense
hadn
t
been
referred
to
him
he
never
named
what
he
paid
for
anything
also
delia
had
made
him
understand
that
if
they
should
go
to
as
guests
of
the
artist
and
his
friend
flack
wouldn
t
be
of
the
company
she
was
sure
those
gentlemen
wouldn
t
rope
him
in
in
fact
she
was
too
sure
for
though
enjoying
him
not
at
all
charles
waterlow
would
on
this
occasion
have
made
a
point
of
expressing
by
an
act
of
courtesy
his
sense
of
obligation
to
a
man
who
had
brought
him
such
a
subject
delia
s
hint
however
was
for
her
father
he
would
have
thought
it
a
gross
breach
of
friendly
loyalty
to
take
part
in
a
festival
not
graced
by
flack
s
presence
his
idea
of
loyalty
was
that
he
should
scarcely
smoke
a
cigar
unless
his
friend
was
there
to
take
another
and
he
felt
rather
mean
if
he
went
round
alone
to
get
shaved
as
regards
he
took
over
the
project
while
george
flack
telegraphed
for
a
table
on
the
terrace
at
the
pavilion
henri
quatre
dosson
had
by
this
time
learned
to
trust
the
european
manager
of
the
reverberator
to
spend
his
money
almost
as
he
himself
would
iv
delia
had
broken
out
the
evening
they
took
probert
to
the
circus
she
had
apostrophised
francie
as
they
each
sat
in
a
chair
after
ascending
to
their
apartments
they
had
bade
their
companions
farewell
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
the
two
gentlemen
had
walked
off
in
different
directions
but
upstairs
they
had
instinctively
not
separated
they
dropped
into
the
first
places
and
sat
looking
at
each
other
and
at
the
lamps
that
burned
night
after
night
in
their
empty
saloon
well
i
want
to
know
when
you
re
going
to
stop
delia
said
to
her
sister
speaking
as
if
this
remark
were
a
continuation
which
it
was
not
of
something
they
had
lately
been
saying
stop
what
asked
francie
reaching
forward
for
a
marron
stop
the
way
you
do
with
francie
stared
while
she
consumed
her
marron
then
she
replied
in
her
small
flat
patient
voice
why
delia
dosson
how
can
you
be
so
foolish
father
i
wish
you
d
speak
to
her
francie
i
ain
t
foolish
delia
submitted
what
do
you
want
me
to
say
to
her
dosson
enquired
i
guess
i
ve
said
about
all
i
well
that
s
in
fun
i
want
you
to
speak
to
her
in
i
guess
there
s
no
one
in
earnest
but
you
francie
remarked
these
ain
t
so
good
as
the
no
and
there
won
t
be
if
you
don
t
look
out
there
s
something
you
can
do
if
you
ll
just
keep
quiet
if
you
can
t
tell
difference
of
style
well
i
can
delia
cried
what
s
the
difference
of
style
asked
dosson
but
before
this
question
could
be
answered
francie
protested
against
the
charge
of
quiet
wasn
t
she
as
quiet
as
a
quaker
meeting
delia
replied
that
a
girl
wasn
t
quiet
so
long
as
she
didn
t
keep
others
so
and
she
wanted
to
know
what
her
sister
proposed
to
do
about
flack
why
don
t
you
take
him
and
let
francie
take
the
other
dosson
continued
that
s
just
what
i
m
after
to
make
her
take
the
other
said
his
elder
daughter
take
him
how
do
you
mean
francie
returned
oh
you
know
yes
i
guess
you
know
how
dosson
laughed
with
an
absence
of
prejudice
that
might
have
been
deplored
in
a
parent
do
you
want
to
stay
in
europe
or
not
that
s
what
want
to
know
delia
pursued
to
her
sister
if
you
want
to
go
bang
home
you
re
taking
the
right
way
to
do
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it
dosson
audibly
wondered
should
you
like
so
much
to
reside
at
that
place
where
is
it
where
his
paper
s
published
that
s
where
you
ll
have
to
pull
up
sooner
or
later
delia
declaimed
do
you
want
to
stay
right
here
in
europe
father
francie
said
with
her
small
sweet
weariness
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
staying
right
here
i
want
to
go
right
home
some
well
then
you
ve
got
to
go
without
probert
delia
made
answer
with
decision
if
you
think
he
wants
to
live
over
there
why
delia
he
wants
dreadfully
to
go
he
told
me
so
himself
francie
argued
with
passionless
pauses
yes
and
when
he
gets
there
he
ll
want
to
come
back
i
thought
you
were
so
much
interested
in
my
poor
child
i
am
interested
smiled
francie
ain
t
i
interested
father
well
i
don
t
know
how
you
could
act
differently
to
show
well
i
do
then
said
delia
and
if
you
don
t
make
flack
understand
oh
i
guess
he
understands
he
s
so
bright
francie
vaguely
pleaded
yes
i
guess
he
does
he
is
bright
said
dosson
chickens
he
added
and
wandered
off
to
a
couch
of
untroubled
repose
his
daughters
sat
up
half
an
hour
later
but
not
by
the
wish
of
the
younger
girl
she
was
always
passive
however
always
docile
when
delia
was
as
she
said
on
the
and
though
she
had
none
of
her
sister
s
insistence
she
was
courageous
in
suffering
she
thought
delia
whipped
her
up
too
much
but
there
was
that
in
her
which
would
have
prevented
her
ever
running
away
she
could
smile
and
smile
for
an
hour
without
irritation
making
even
pacific
answers
though
all
the
while
it
hurt
her
to
be
heavily
exhorted
much
as
it
would
have
done
to
be
violently
pushed
she
knew
delia
loved
her
not
loving
herself
meanwhile
a
bit
as
no
one
else
in
the
world
probably
ever
would
but
there
was
something
funny
in
such
plans
for
her
plans
of
ambition
which
could
only
involve
a
the
real
answer
to
anything
to
everything
her
sister
might
say
at
these
hours
of
urgency
was
oh
if
you
want
to
make
out
that
people
are
thinking
of
me
or
that
they
ever
will
you
ought
to
remember
that
no
one
can
possibly
think
of
me
half
as
much
as
you
do
therefore
if
there
s
to
be
any
comfort
for
either
of
us
we
had
both
much
better
just
go
on
as
we
she
didn
t
however
on
this
occasion
meet
her
constant
companion
with
that
syllogism
because
a
formidable
force
seemed
to
lurk
in
the
great
contention
that
the
star
of
matrimony
for
the
american
girl
was
now
shining
in
the
east
in
england
and
france
and
italy
they
had
only
to
look
round
anywhere
to
see
it
what
did
they
hear
of
every
day
in
the
week
but
of
the
engagement
of
somebody
no
better
than
they
to
some
count
or
some
lord
delia
dwelt
on
the
evident
truth
that
it
was
in
that
vast
vague
section
of
the
globe
to
which
she
never
alluded
save
as
over
here
that
the
american
girl
was
now
called
upon
to
play
under
providence
her
part
when
francie
made
the
point
that
probert
was
neither
a
count
nor
a
lord
her
sister
rejoined
that
she
didn
t
care
whether
he
was
or
not
to
this
francie
replied
that
she
herself
didn
t
care
but
that
delia
ought
to
for
consistency
well
he
s
a
prince
compared
with
flack
delia
declared
he
hasn
t
the
same
ability
not
he
has
the
ability
to
have
three
sisters
who
are
just
the
sort
of
people
i
want
you
to
what
good
will
they
do
me
francie
asked
they
ll
hate
me
before
they
could
turn
round
i
should
do
something
in
perfect
innocence
that
they
d
think
well
what
would
that
matter
if
he
liked
you
oh
but
he
wouldn
t
then
he
d
hate
me
then
all
you
ve
got
to
do
is
not
to
do
it
delia
concluded
oh
but
i
should
every
time
her
sister
went
on
delia
looked
at
her
a
moment
what
are
you
talking
about
yes
what
am
i
it
s
disgusting
and
francie
sprang
up
i
m
sorry
you
have
such
thoughts
said
delia
sententiously
it
s
disgusting
to
talk
about
a
gentleman
and
his
sisters
and
his
society
and
everything
else
before
he
has
scarcely
looked
at
it
s
disgusting
if
he
isn
t
just
dying
but
it
isn
t
if
he
well
i
ll
make
him
skip
francie
went
on
with
a
sudden
approach
to
sharpness
oh
you
re
worse
than
father
her
sister
cried
giving
her
a
push
as
they
went
to
bed
they
reached
with
their
companions
nearly
an
hour
before
the
time
it
had
been
agreed
they
had
best
dine
the
purpose
of
this
being
to
enable
them
to
enjoy
with
what
remained
of
daylight
a
stroll
on
the
celebrated
terrace
and
a
study
of
the
magnificent
view
the
evening
was
splendid
and
the
atmosphere
favourable
to
these
impressions
the
grass
was
vivid
on
the
broad
walk
beside
the
parapet
the
park
and
forest
were
fresh
and
leafy
and
the
prettiest
golden
light
hung
over
the
curving
seine
and
the
city
the
hill
which
forms
the
terrace
stretched
down
among
the
vineyards
with
the
poles
delicate
yet
in
their
bareness
to
the
river
and
the
prospect
was
spotted
here
and
there
with
the
red
legs
of
the
little
sauntering
soldiers
of
the
garrison
how
it
came
after
delia
s
warning
in
regard
to
her
especially
as
she
hadn
t
failed
to
feel
the
weight
of
her
sister
s
wisdom
francie
couldn
t
have
told
herself
certain
it
is
that
before
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
she
became
aware
first
that
the
evening
wouldn
t
pass
without
flack
s
taking
in
some
way
and
for
a
certain
time
peculiar
possession
of
her
and
then
that
he
was
already
doing
so
that
he
had
drawn
her
away
from
the
others
who
were
stopping
behind
to
appreciate
the
view
that
he
made
her
walk
faster
and
that
he
had
ended
by
interposing
such
a
distance
that
she
was
practically
alone
with
him
this
was
what
he
wanted
but
it
was
not
all
she
saw
he
now
wanted
a
great
many
other
things
the
large
perspective
of
the
terrace
stretched
away
before
them
probert
had
said
it
was
in
the
grand
style
and
he
was
determined
to
make
her
walk
to
the
end
she
felt
sorry
for
his
ideas
she
thought
of
them
in
the
light
of
his
striking
energy
they
were
an
idle
exercise
of
a
force
intrinsically
fine
and
she
wanted
to
protest
to
let
him
know
how
truly
it
was
a
sad
misuse
of
his
free
bold
spirit
to
count
on
her
she
was
not
to
be
counted
on
she
was
a
vague
soft
negative
being
who
had
never
decided
anything
and
never
would
who
had
not
even
the
merit
of
knowing
how
to
flirt
and
who
only
asked
to
be
let
alone
she
made
him
stop
at
last
telling
him
while
she
leaned
against
the
parapet
that
he
walked
too
fast
and
she
looked
back
at
their
companions
whom
she
expected
to
see
under
pressure
from
delia
following
at
the
highest
speed
but
they
were
not
following
they
still
stood
together
there
only
looking
attentively
enough
at
the
couple
who
had
left
them
delia
would
wave
a
parasol
beckon
her
back
send
waterlow
to
bring
her
francie
invoked
from
one
moment
to
another
some
such
appeal
as
that
but
no
appeal
came
none
at
least
but
the
odd
spectacle
presently
of
an
agitation
of
the
group
which
evidently
under
delia
s
direction
turned
round
and
retraced
its
steps
francie
guessed
in
a
moment
what
was
meant
by
that
it
was
the
most
definite
signal
her
sister
could
have
given
it
made
her
feel
that
delia
counted
on
her
but
to
such
a
different
end
just
as
poor
flack
did
just
as
delia
wished
to
persuade
her
that
probert
did
the
girl
gave
a
sigh
looking
up
with
troubled
eyes
at
her
companion
and
at
the
figure
of
herself
as
the
subject
of
contending
policies
such
a
thankless
bored
evasive
little
subject
as
she
felt
herself
what
delia
had
said
in
turning
away
was
yes
i
m
watching
you
and
i
depend
on
you
to
finish
him
up
stay
there
with
him
go
off
with
him
i
ll
allow
you
half
an
hour
if
necessary
only
settle
him
once
for
all
it
s
very
kind
of
me
to
give
you
this
chance
and
in
return
for
it
i
expect
you
to
be
able
to
tell
me
this
evening
that
he
has
his
answer
shut
him
up
francie
didn
t
in
the
least
dislike
flack
interested
as
i
am
in
presenting
her
favourably
to
the
reader
i
am
yet
obliged
as
a
veracious
historian
to
admit
that
she
believed
him
as
bright
as
her
father
had
originally
pronounced
him
and
as
any
young
man
she
was
likely
to
meet
she
had
no
other
measure
for
distinction
in
young
men
but
their
brightness
she
had
never
been
present
at
any
imputation
of
ability
or
power
that
this
term
didn
t
seem
to
cover
in
many
a
girl
so
great
a
kindness
might
have
been
fanned
to
something
of
a
flame
by
the
breath
of
close
criticism
i
probably
exaggerate
little
the
perversity
of
pretty
girls
in
saying
that
our
young
woman
might
at
this
moment
have
answered
her
sister
with
no
i
wasn
t
in
love
with
him
but
somehow
since
you
re
so
very
disgusted
i
foresee
that
i
shall
be
if
he
presses
it
is
doubtless
difficult
to
say
more
for
francie
s
simplicity
of
character
than
that
she
felt
no
need
of
encouraging
flack
in
order
to
prove
to
herself
that
she
wasn
t
bullied
she
didn
t
care
whether
she
were
bullied
or
not
and
she
was
perfectly
capable
of
letting
delia
believe
her
to
have
carried
mildness
to
the
point
of
giving
up
a
man
she
had
a
secret
sentiment
for
in
order
to
oblige
a
relative
who
fairly
brooded
with
devotion
she
wasn
t
clear
herself
as
to
whether
it
mightn
t
be
so
her
pride
what
she
had
of
it
lay
in
an
undistributed
inert
form
quite
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
and
she
had
never
yet
thought
of
a
dignified
theory
to
cover
her
want
of
uppishness
she
felt
as
she
looked
up
at
flack
that
she
didn
t
care
even
if
he
should
think
she
sacrificed
him
to
a
childish
docility
his
bright
eyes
were
hard
as
if
he
could
almost
guess
how
cynical
she
was
and
she
turned
her
own
again
toward
her
retreating
companions
they
re
going
to
dinner
we
oughtn
t
to
be
dawdling
here
she
said
well
if
they
re
going
to
dinner
they
ll
have
to
eat
the
napkins
i
ordered
it
and
i
know
when
it
ll
be
ready
george
flack
answered
besides
they
re
not
going
to
dinner
they
re
going
to
walk
in
the
park
don
t
you
worry
we
shan
t
lose
them
i
wish
we
could
the
young
man
added
in
his
boldest
gayest
manner
you
wish
we
could
i
should
like
to
feel
you
just
under
my
particular
protection
and
no
well
i
don
t
know
what
the
dangers
are
said
francie
setting
herself
in
motion
again
she
went
after
the
others
but
at
the
end
of
a
few
steps
he
stopped
her
again
you
won
t
have
confidence
i
wish
you
d
believe
what
i
tell
you
haven
t
told
me
and
she
turned
her
back
to
him
looking
away
at
the
splendid
view
i
do
love
the
scenery
she
added
in
a
moment
well
leave
it
alone
a
little
it
won
t
run
away
i
want
to
tell
you
something
about
myself
if
i
could
flatter
myself
you
d
take
any
interest
in
he
had
thrust
the
raised
point
of
his
cane
into
the
low
wall
of
the
terrace
and
he
leaned
on
the
knob
screwing
the
other
end
gently
round
with
both
hands
i
ll
take
an
interest
if
i
can
understand
said
francie
you
can
understand
right
enough
if
you
ll
try
i
got
some
news
from
america
he
went
on
that
i
like
awfully
the
reverberator
has
taken
a
this
was
not
what
francie
had
expected
but
it
was
better
taken
a
jump
it
has
gone
straight
up
it
s
in
the
second
hundred
hundred
thousand
dollars
said
francie
no
miss
francie
copies
that

the
circulation
but
the
dollars
are
footing
up
and
do
they
all
come
to
you
precious
few
of
them
i
wish
they
did
it
s
a
sweet
then
it
isn
t
yours
she
asked
turning
round
to
him
it
was
an
impulse
of
sympathy
that
made
her
look
at
him
now
for
she
already
knew
how
much
he
had
the
success
of
his
newspaper
at
heart
he
had
once
told
her
he
loved
the
reverberator
as
he
had
loved
his
first
mine
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
suppose
i
own
it
george
flack
shouted
the
light
projected
upon
her
innocence
by
his
tone
was
so
strong
that
the
girl
blushed
and
he
went
on
more
tenderly
it
s
a
pretty
sight
the
way
you
and
your
sister
take
that
sort
of
thing
for
granted
do
you
think
property
grows
on
you
like
a
moustache
well
it
seems
as
if
it
had
on
your
father
if
i
owned
the
reverberator
i
wouldn
t
be
stumping
round
here
i
d
give
my
attention
to
another
branch
of
the
business
that
is
i
d
give
my
attention
to
all
but
i
wouldn
t
go
round
with
the
still
i
m
going
to
capture
the
blamed
thing
and
i
want
you
to
help
me
the
young
man
went
on
that
s
just
what
i
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
it
s
a
big
proposition
as
it
stands
but
i
mean
to
make
it
bigger
the
most
universal
the
world
has
seen
that
s
where
the
future
lies
and
the
man
who
sees
it
first
is
the
man
who
ll
make
his
pile
it
s
a
field
for
enlightened
enterprise
that
hasn
t
yet
begun
to
be
he
continued
glowing
as
if
on
a
sudden
with
his
idea
and
one
of
his
knowing
eyes
itself
for
an
emphasis
habitual
with
him
when
he
talked
consecutively
the
effect
of
this
would
have
been
droll
to
a
listener
the
note
of
the
prospectus
mingling
with
the
question
of
his
more
intimate
hope
but
it
was
not
droll
to
francie
she
only
thought
it
or
supposed
it
a
proof
of
the
way
flack
saw
everything
on
a
stupendous
scale
there
are
ten
thousand
things
to
do
that
haven
t
been
done
and
i
m
going
to
do
them
the
of
every
quarter
of
the
globe
furnished
by
the
prominent
members
themselves
oh
they
can
be
fixed
you
ll
see
from
day
to
day
and
from
hour
to
hour
and
served
up
hot
at
every
in
the
united
states
that
s
what
the
american
people
want
and
that
s
what
the
american
people
are
going
to
have
i
wouldn
t
say
it
to
every
one
but
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
i
consider
my
guess
as
good
as
the
next
man
s
on
what
s
going
to
be
required
in
future
over
there
i
m
going
for
the
inside
view
the
choice
bits
the
chronique
intime
as
they
say
here
what
the
people
want
s
just
what
ain
t
told
and
i
m
going
to
tell
it
oh
they
re
bound
to
have
the
plums
that
s
about
played
out
anyway
the
idea
of
sticking
up
a
sign
of
private
and
hands
off
and
no
thoroughfare
and
thinking
you
can
keep
the
place
to
yourself
you
ain
t
going
to
be
able
any
longer
to
monopolise
any
fact
of
general
interest
and
it
ain
t
going
to
be
right
you
should
it
ain
t
going
to
continue
to
be
possible
to
keep
out
anywhere
the
light
of
the
press
now
what
i
m
going
to
do
is
to
set
up
the
biggest
lamp
yet
made
and
make
it
shine
all
over
the
place
we
ll
see
who
s
private
then
and
whose
hands
are
off
and
who
ll
frustrate
the
people
the
people
that
wants
to
know
that
s
a
sign
of
the
american
people
that
they
do
want
to
know
and
it
s
the
sign
of
george
flack
the
young
man
pursued
with
a
rising
spirit
that
he
s
going
to
help
them
but
i
ll
make
the
touchy
folks
crowd
in
themselves
with
their
information
and
as
i
tell
you
miss
francie
it
s
a
job
in
which
you
can
give
me
a
lovely
well
i
don
t
see
how
said
francie
candidly
i
haven
t
got
any
choice
bits
or
any
facts
of
general
she
spoke
gaily
because
she
was
relieved
she
thought
she
had
in
truth
a
glimpse
of
what
he
wanted
of
her
it
was
something
better
than
she
had
feared
since
he
didn
t
own
the
great
newspaper
her
view
of
such
possibilities
was
of
the
dimmest
he
desired
to
possess
himself
of
it
and
she
sufficiently
grasped
the
idea
that
money
was
needed
for
that
she
further
seemed
to
make
out
that
he
presented
himself
to
her
that
he
hovered
about
her
and
pressed
on
her
as
moneyless
and
that
this
brought
them
round
by
a
vague
but
comfortable
transition
to
a
helpful
remembrance
that
her
father
was
not
the
remaining
divination
silently
achieved
was
quick
and
happy
she
should
acquit
herself
by
asking
her
father
for
the
sum
required
and
by
just
passing
it
on
to
flack
the
grandeur
of
his
enterprise
and
the
force
of
his
reasoning
appeared
to
overshadow
her
as
they
stood
there
this
was
a
delightful
simplification
and
it
didn
t
for
the
moment
strike
her
as
positively
unnatural
that
her
companion
should
have
a
delicacy
about
appealing
to
dosson
directly
for
financial
aid
though
indeed
she
would
have
been
capable
of
thinking
that
odd
had
she
meditated
on
it
there
was
nothing
simpler
to
francie
than
the
idea
of
putting
her
hand
into
her
father
s
pocket
and
she
felt
that
even
delia
would
be
glad
to
appease
their
persecutor
by
this
casual
gesture
i
must
add
unfortunately
that
her
alarm
came
back
to
her
from
his
look
as
he
replied
do
you
mean
to
say
you
don
t
know
after
all
i
ve
done
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
what
you
ve
haven
t
i
tried
all
i
know
to
make
you
like
me
oh
dear
i
do
like
you
cried
francie
but
how
will
that
help
you
it
will
help
me
if
you
ll
understand
how
i
love
well
i
won
t
understand
replied
the
girl
as
she
walked
off
he
followed
her
they
went
on
together
in
silence
and
then
he
said
do
you
mean
to
say
you
haven
t
found
that
out
oh
i
don
t
find
things
out
i
ain
t
an
editor
francie
gaily
quavered
you
draw
me
out
and
then
you
gibe
at
me
flack
returned
i
didn
t
draw
you
out
why
couldn
t
you
see
me
just
strain
to
get
away
don
t
you
sympathise
then
with
my
ideas
of
course
i
do
flack
i
think
your
ideas
splendid
said
francie
who
hadn
t
in
the
least
taken
them
in
well
then
why
won
t
you
work
with
me
your
affection
your
brightness
your
faith
to
say
nothing
of
your
matchless
beauty
would
be
everything
to
i
m
very
sorry
but
i
can
t
i
can
t
she
protested
you
could
if
you
would
quick
well
then
i
won
t
and
as
soon
as
these
words
were
spoken
as
if
to
mitigate
something
of
their
asperity
she
made
her
other
point
you
must
remember
that
i
never
said
i
would
nor
anything
like
it
not
one
little
wee
mite
i
thought
you
just
wanted
me
to
speak
to
of
course
i
supposed
you
d
do
that
he
allowed
i
mean
about
your
about
my
paper
so
as
he
could
give
you
the
money
to
do
what
you
lord
you
re
too
sweet
george
flack
cried
with
an
illumined
stare
do
you
suppose
i
d
ever
touch
a
cent
of
your
father
s
money
a
speech
not
rankly
hypocritical
inasmuch
as
the
young
man
who
made
his
own
discriminations
had
never
been
guilty
and
proposed
to
himself
never
to
be
of
the
indelicacy
of
tugging
at
his
potential
s
with
his
own
hand
he
had
talked
to
dosson
by
the
hour
about
his
of
making
the
touchy
folks
themselves
fall
into
line
but
had
never
dreamed
this
man
would
subsidise
him
as
an
interesting
struggler
the
only
character
in
which
he
could
expect
it
would
be
that
of
francie
s
accepted
suitor
and
then
the
liberality
would
have
francie
and
not
himself
for
its
object
this
reasoning
naturally
didn
t
lessen
his
impatience
to
take
on
the
happy
character
so
that
his
love
of
his
profession
and
his
appreciation
of
the
girl
at
his
side
now
ached
together
in
his
breast
with
the
same
disappointment
she
saw
that
her
words
had
touched
him
like
a
lash
they
made
him
for
a
moment
flush
to
his
eyes
this
caused
her
own
colour
to
rise
she
could
scarcely
have
said
why
and
she
hurried
along
again
he
kept
close
to
her
he
argued
with
her
he
besought
her
to
think
it
over
assuring
her
he
had
brains
heart
and
material
proofs
of
a
college
education
to
this
she
replied
that
if
he
didn
t
leave
her
alone
she
should
cry
and
how
would
he
like
that
to
bring
her
back
in
such
a
state
to
the
others
he
answered
damn
the
others
but
it
didn
t
help
his
case
and
at
last
he
broke
out
will
you
just
tell
me
this
then
is
it
because
you
ve
promised
miss
delia
francie
returned
that
she
hadn
t
promised
miss
delia
anything
and
her
companion
went
on
of
course
i
know
what
she
has
got
in
her
head
she
wants
to
get
you
into
the
smart
set
the
grand
monde
as
they
call
it
here
but
i
didn
t
suppose
you
d
let
her
fix
your
life
for
you
you
were
very
different
before
he
turned
she
never
fixed
anything
for
me
i
haven
t
got
any
life
and
i
don
t
want
to
have
any
francie
veraciously
pleaded
and
i
don
t
know
who
you
re
talking
about
either
the
man
without
a
country
he
ll
pass
you
in
that
s
what
your
sister
you
oughtn
t
to
abuse
him
because
it
was
you
that
presented
him
the
girl
pronounced
i
never
presented
him
i
d
like
to
kick
we
should
never
have
seen
him
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
she
maintained
that
s
a
fact
but
it
doesn
t
make
me
love
him
any
better
he
s
the
poorest
kind
there
i
don
t
care
anything
about
his
that
s
a
pity
if
you
re
going
to
marry
him
right
off
how
could
i
know
that
when
i
took
you
up
there
flack
said
francie
trying
to
gain
ground
from
him
this
attempt
was
of
course
vain
and
after
a
moment
he
resumed
will
you
keep
me
as
a
friend
why
flack
of
course
i
will
cried
the
easy
creature
all
right
he
replied
and
they
presently
overtook
their
companions
v
gaston
probert
made
his
plan
confiding
it
only
to
his
friend
waterlow
whose
help
indeed
he
needed
to
carry
it
out
these
revelations
cost
him
something
for
the
ornament
of
the
merciless
school
as
it
might
have
been
called
found
his
predicament
amusing
and
made
no
scruple
of
showing
it
gaston
was
too
much
in
love
however
to
be
upset
by
a
bad
joke
or
two
this
fact
is
the
more
noteworthy
as
he
knew
that
waterlow
scoffed
at
him
for
a
purpose
had
a
view
of
the
good
to
be
done
him
by
throwing
him
on
the
defensive
the
french
tradition
or
a
grimacing
ghost
of
it
was
in
waterlow
s
manner
but
it
had
not
made
its
mark
on
his
view
of
the
relations
of
a
young
man
of
spirit
with
parents
and
pastors
he
mixed
his
colours
as
might
have
been
said
with
the
general
sense
of
france
but
his
early
american
immunities
and
serenities
could
still
swell
his
sail
in
any
vital
discussion
with
a
friend
in
whose
life
the
principle
of
authority
played
so
large
a
part
he
accused
probert
of
being
afraid
of
his
sisters
which
was
an
effective
way
and
he
knew
it
of
alluding
to
the
rigidity
of
the
conception
of
the
family
among
people
who
had
adopted
and
had
even
to
waterlow
s
sense
as
the
phrase
is
improved
upon
the
latin
ideal
that
did
injustice
and
this
the
artist
also
knew
to
the
delicate
nature
of
the
bond
uniting
the
different
members
of
the
house
of
probert
who
were
each
for
all
and
all
for
each
family
feeling
among
them
was
not
a
tyranny
but
a
religion
and
in
regard
to
mesdames
de
brecourt
de
cliche
and
de
douves
what
gaston
most
feared
was
that
he
might
seem
to
them
not
to
love
them
enough
none
the
less
charles
waterlow
who
thought
he
had
charming
parts
held
that
the
best
way
hadn
t
been
taken
to
make
a
man
of
him
and
the
zeal
with
which
the
painter
appeared
to
have
proposed
to
repair
that
mistake
was
founded
in
esteem
though
it
sometimes
flowered
in
freedom
waterlow
combined
in
odd
fashion
many
of
the
forms
of
the
parisian
studio
with
the
moral
and
social
ideas
of
brooklyn
long
island
where
the
seeds
of
his
strictness
had
been
sown
gaston
probert
desired
nothing
better
than
to
be
a
man
what
worried
him
and
it
is
perhaps
a
proof
that
his
instinct
was
gravely
at
fault
was
a
certain
vagueness
as
to
the
constituents
of
that
character
he
should
approximate
more
nearly
as
it
seemed
to
him
to
the
brute
were
he
to
sacrifice
in
such
an
effort
the
decencies
and
pieties
holy
things
all
of
them
in
which
he
had
been
reared
it
was
very
well
for
waterlow
to
say
that
to
be
a
real
man
it
was
necessary
to
be
a
little
of
a
brute
his
friend
was
willing
in
theory
to
assent
even
to
that
the
difficulty
was
in
application
in
practice
as
to
which
the
painter
declared
that
all
would
be
easy
if
such
account
hadn
t
to
be
taken
of
the
marquise
the
comtesse
and
what
was
the
other
one
the
princess
these
young
amenities
were
exchanged
between
the
pair
while
gaston
explained
almost
as
eagerly
as
if
he
were
scoring
a
point
that
the
other
one
was
only
a
baronne
during
that
brief
journey
to
spain
of
which
mention
has
already
been
made
during
the
later
weeks
of
the
summer
after
their
return
the
friends
then
spent
a
fortnight
together
on
the
coast
of
brittany
and
above
all
during
the
autumn
when
they
were
settled
in
paris
for
the
winter
when
dosson
had
reappeared
according
to
the
engagement
with
his
daughters
when
the
sittings
for
the
portrait
had
multiplied
the
painter
was
unscrupulous
as
to
the
number
he
demanded
and
the
work
itself
born
under
a
happy
star
seemed
to
take
more
and
more
the
turn
of
a
great
thing
it
was
at
granada
that
gaston
had
really
broken
out
there
one
balmy
night
he
had
dropped
into
his
comrade
s
ear
that
he
would
marry
francina
dosson
or
would
never
marry
at
all
the
declaration
was
the
more
striking
as
it
had
come
after
such
an
interval
many
days
had
elapsed
since
their
separation
from
the
young
lady
and
many
new
and
beautiful
objects
appealed
to
them
it
appeared
that
the
smitten
youth
had
been
thinking
of
her
all
the
while
and
he
let
his
friend
know
that
it
was
the
dinner
at
that
had
finished
him
what
she
had
been
there
waterlow
himself
had
seen
he
wouldn
t
controvert
the
lucid
proposition
that
she
showed
a
cutting
equal
to
any
greek
gem
in
november
in
paris
it
was
months
and
weeks
before
the
artist
began
to
please
himself
gaston
came
often
to
the
avenue
de
villiers
toward
the
end
of
a
sitting
and
till
it
was
finished
not
to
disturb
the
lovely
model
cultivated
conversation
with
the
elder
sister
the
representative
of
the
proberts
was
capable
of
that
delia
was
always
there
of
course
but
dosson
had
not
once
turned
up
and
the
happily
appeared
to
have
faded
from
view
the
new
aspirant
learned
in
fact
from
miss
dosson
that
a
crisis
in
the
history
of
his
journal
had
recalled
flack
to
the
seat
of
that
publication
when
the
young
ladies
had
gone
and
when
he
didn
t
go
with
them
he
accompanied
them
not
rarely
the
visitor
was
almost
lyrical
in
his
appreciation
of
his
friend
s
work
he
had
no
jealousy
of
the
act
of
appropriation
that
rendered
possible
in
its
turn
such
an
act
of
handing
over
of
which
the
canvas
constituted
the
field
he
was
sure
waterlow
painted
the
girl
too
well
to
be
in
love
with
her
and
that
if
he
himself
could
have
dealt
with
her
in
that
fashion
he
mightn
t
have
wanted
to
deal
in
any
other
she
bloomed
there
on
the
easel
with
all
the
purity
of
life
and
the
artist
had
caught
the
very
secret
of
her
beauty
it
was
exactly
the
way
in
which
her
lover
would
have
chosen
to
see
her
shown
and
yet
it
had
required
a
perfectly
independent
hand
gaston
mused
on
this
mystery
and
somehow
felt
proud
of
the
picture
and
responsible
for
it
though
it
was
no
more
his
property
as
yet
than
the
young
lady
herself
when
in
december
he
put
before
waterlow
his
plan
of
campaign
the
latter
made
a
comment
i
ll
do
anything
in
the
world
you
like
anything
you
think
will
help
you
but
it
passes
me
my
dear
fellow
why
in
the
world
you
don
t
go
to
them
and
say
i
ve
seen
a
girl
who
is
as
good
as
cake
and
pretty
as
fire
she
exactly
suits
me
i
ve
taken
time
to
think
of
it
and
i
know
what
i
want
therefore
i
propose
to
make
her
my
wife
if
you
happen
to
like
her
so
much
the
better
if
you
don
t
be
so
good
as
to
keep
it
to
that
s
much
the
most
excellent
way
why
in
the
name
of
goodness
all
these
mysteries
and
machinations
oh
you
don
t
understand
you
don
t
understand
sighed
gaston
who
had
never
pulled
so
long
a
face
one
can
t
break
with
one
s
traditions
in
an
hour
especially
when
there
s
so
much
in
them
that
one
likes
i
shan
t
love
her
more
if
they
like
her
but
i
shall
love
them
more
and
i
care
about
that
you
talk
as
a
man
who
has
nothing
to
consider
i
ve
everything
to
consider
and
i
m
glad
i
have
my
pleasure
in
marrying
her
will
be
double
if
my
father
and
my
sisters
accept
her
and
i
shall
greatly
enjoy
working
out
the
business
of
bringing
them
there
were
moments
when
charles
waterlow
resented
the
very
vocabulary
of
his
friend
he
hated
to
hear
a
man
talk
about
the
acceptance
by
any
one
but
himself
of
the
woman
he
loved
one
s
own
acceptance
of
one
s
bliss
in
such
a
case
ended
the
matter
and
the
effort
to
bring
round
those
who
gave
her
the
cold
shoulder
was
scarcely
consistent
with
the
highest
spirit
young
probert
explained
that
of
course
he
felt
his
relatives
would
only
have
to
know
francina
to
like
her
to
delight
in
her
yet
also
that
to
know
her
they
would
first
have
to
make
her
acquaintance
this
was
the
delicate
point
for
social
commerce
with
such
malheureux
as
dosson
and
delia
was
not
in
the
least
in
their
usual
line
and
it
was
impossible
to
disconnect
the
poor
girl
from
her
appendages
therefore
the
whole
question
must
be
approached
by
an
oblique
movement
it
would
never
do
to
march
straight
up
the
wedge
should
have
a
narrow
end
which
gaston
now
made
sure
he
had
found
his
sister
susan
was
another
name
for
this
subtle
engine
he
would
break
her
in
first
and
she
would
help
him
to
break
in
the
others
she
was
his
favourite
relation
his
intimate
friend
the
most
modern
the
most
parisian
and
inflammable
member
of
the
family
she
had
no
suite
dans
les
idees
but
she
had
perceptions
had
imagination
and
humour
and
was
capable
of
generosity
of
enthusiasm
and
even
of
blind
infatuation
she
had
in
fact
taken
two
or
three
plunges
of
her
own
and
ought
to
allow
for
those
of
others
she
wouldn
t
like
the
dossons
superficially
any
better
than
his
father
or
than
margaret
or
than
jane
he
called
these
ladies
by
their
english
names
but
for
themselves
their
husbands
their
friends
and
each
other
they
were
suzanne
marguerite
and
jeanne
but
there
was
a
good
chance
of
his
gaining
her
to
his
side
she
was
as
fond
of
beauty
and
of
the
arts
as
he
this
was
one
of
their
bonds
of
union
she
appreciated
highly
charles
waterlow
s
talent
and
there
had
been
talk
of
her
deciding
to
sit
to
him
it
was
true
her
husband
viewed
the
project
with
so
much
colder
an
eye
that
it
had
not
been
carried
out
according
to
gaston
s
plan
she
was
to
come
to
the
avenue
de
villiers
to
see
what
the
artist
had
done
for
miss
francie
her
brother
was
to
have
worked
upon
her
in
advance
by
his
careful
rhapsodies
bearing
wholly
on
the
achievement
itself
the
dazzling
example
of
waterlow
s
powers
and
not
on
the
young
lady
whom
he
was
not
to
let
her
know
at
first
that
he
had
so
much
as
seen
just
at
the
last
just
before
her
visit
he
was
to
mention
to
her
that
he
had
met
the
girl
at
the
studio
and
that
she
was
as
remarkable
in
her
way
as
the
picture
seeing
the
picture
and
hearing
this
mme
de
brecourt
as
a
disinterested
lover
of
charming
impressions
and
above
all
as
an
easy
prey
at
all
times
to
a
rabid
curiosity
would
express
a
desire
also
to
enjoy
a
sight
of
so
rare
a
creature
on
which
waterlow
might
pronounce
it
all
arrangeable
if
she
would
but
come
in
some
day
when
miss
francie
should
sit
he
would
give
her
two
or
three
dates
and
gaston
would
see
that
she
didn
t
let
the
opportunity
pass
she
would
return
alone
this
time
he
wouldn
t
go
with
her
and
she
would
be
as
taken
as
could
be
hoped
or
needed
everything
much
depended
on
that
but
it
couldn
t
fail
the
girl
would
have
to
take
her
but
the
girl
could
be
trusted
especially
if
she
didn
t
know
who
the
demonstrative
french
lady
was
with
her
fine
plain
face
her
hair
so
blond
as
to
be
nearly
white
her
vividly
red
lips
and
protuberant
eyes
their
host
was
to
do
no
introducing
and
to
reveal
the
visitor
s
identity
only
after
she
had
gone
that
was
a
condition
indeed
this
participant
grumbled
at
he
called
the
whole
business
an
odious
comedy
though
his
friend
knew
that
if
he
undertook
it
he
would
acquit
himself
honourably
after
mme
de
brecourt
had
been
captivated
the
question
of
how
francie
would
be
affected
received
in
advance
no
consideration
her
brother
would
throw
off
the
mask
and
convince
her
that
she
must
now
work
with
him
another
meeting
would
be
managed
for
her
with
the
girl
in
which
each
would
appear
in
her
proper
character
and
in
short
the
plot
would
thicken
gaston
s
forecast
of
his
difficulties
showed
how
finely
he
could
analyse
but
that
was
not
rare
enough
in
any
french
connexion
to
make
his
friend
stare
he
brought
suzanne
de
brecourt
she
was
enchanted
with
the
portrait
of
the
little
american
and
the
rest
of
the
drama
began
to
follow
in
its
order
mme
de
brecourt
raved
to
waterlow
s
face
she
had
no
opinions
behind
people
s
backs
about
his
mastery
of
his
craft
she
could
dispose
the
floral
tributes
of
homage
with
a
hand
of
practice
all
her
own
she
was
the
reverse
of
egotistic
and
never
spoke
of
herself
her
success
in
life
sprang
from
a
much
wiser
adoption
of
pronouns
waterlow
who
liked
her
and
had
long
wanted
to
paint
her
ugliness
it
was
a
of
charm
had
two
opinions
about
her
one
of
which
was
that
she
knew
a
hundred
times
less
than
she
thought
and
even
than
her
brother
thought
of
what
she
talked
about
and
the
other
that
she
was
after
all
not
such
a
humbug
as
she
seemed
she
passed
in
her
family
for
a
rank
radical
a
bold
bohemian
she
picked
up
expressions
out
of
newspapers
and
at
the
petits
theatres
but
her
hands
and
feet
were
celebrated
and
her
behaviour
was
not
that
of
her
sisters
as
well
had
never
been
disastrously
exposed
but
she
must
be
charming
your
young
lady
she
said
to
gaston
while
she
turned
her
head
this
way
and
that
as
she
stood
before
francie
s
image
she
s
a
little
renaissance
statuette
cast
in
silver
something
of
jean
goujon
or
germain
the
young
men
exchanged
a
glance
for
this
struck
them
as
the
happiest
comparison
and
gaston
replied
in
a
detached
way
that
the
girl
was
well
worth
seeing
he
went
in
to
have
a
cup
of
tea
with
his
sister
on
the
day
he
knew
she
would
have
paid
her
second
visit
to
the
studio
and
the
first
words
she
greeted
him
with
were
but
she
s
admirable
votre
petite
admirable
admirable
there
was
a
lady
calling
in
the
place
beauvau
at
the
moment
old
mme
d
outreville
who
naturally
asked
for
news
of
the
object
of
such
enthusiasm
gaston
suffered
susan
to
answer
all
questions
and
was
attentive
to
her
account
of
the
new
beauty
she
described
his
young
friend
almost
as
well
as
he
would
have
done
from
the
point
of
view
of
her
type
her
graces
her
plastic
value
using
various
technical
and
critical
terms
to
which
the
old
lady
listened
in
silence
solemnly
rather
coldly
as
if
she
thought
such
talk
much
of
a
galimatias
she
belonged
to
the
school
and
held
a
pretty
person
sufficiently
catalogued
when
it
had
been
said
she
had
a
dazzling
complexion
or
the
finest
eyes
in
the
world
qu
que
c
est
que
cette
merveille
she
enquired
to
which
mme
de
brecourt
made
answer
that
it
was
a
little
american
her
brother
had
somewhere
dug
up
and
what
do
you
propose
to
do
with
it
may
one
ask
mme
d
outreville
demanded
looking
at
gaston
with
an
eye
that
seemed
to
read
his
secret
and
that
brought
him
for
half
a
minute
to
the
point
of
breaking
out
i
propose
to
marry
it
there
but
he
contained
himself
only
pleading
for
the
present
his
wish
to
ascertain
the
uses
to
which
she
was
adapted
meanwhile
he
added
there
was
nothing
he
so
much
liked
as
to
look
at
her
in
the
measure
in
which
she
would
allow
him
ah
that
may
take
you
far
their
visitor
cried
as
she
got
up
to
go
and
the
young
man
glanced
at
his
sister
to
see
if
she
too
were
ironic
but
she
seemed
almost
awkwardly
free
from
alarm
if
she
had
been
suspicious
it
would
have
been
easier
to
make
his
confession
when
he
came
back
from
accompanying
their
old
friend
outreville
to
her
carriage
he
asked
her
if
waterlow
s
charming
sitter
had
known
who
she
was
and
if
she
had
been
frightened
mme
de
brecourt
stared
she
evidently
thought
that
kind
of
sensibility
implied
an
initiation
and
into
dangers
which
a
little
american
accidentally
encountered
couldn
t
possibly
have
why
should
she
be
frightened
she
wouldn
t
be
even
if
she
had
known
who
i
was
much
less
therefore
when
i
was
nothing
for
oh
you
weren
t
nothing
for
her
the
brooding
youth
declared
and
when
his
sister
rejoined
that
he
was
trop
aimable
he
brought
out
his
lurking
fact
he
had
seen
the
lovely
creature
more
often
than
he
had
mentioned
he
had
particularly
wished
that
she
should
see
her
now
he
wanted
his
father
and
jane
and
margaret
to
do
the
same
and
above
all
he
wanted
them
to
like
her
even
as
she
susan
liked
her
he
was
delighted
she
had
been
taken
he
had
been
so
taken
himself
mme
de
brecourt
protested
that
she
had
reserved
her
independence
of
judgement
and
he
answered
that
if
she
thought
miss
dosson
repulsive
he
might
have
expressed
it
in
another
way
when
she
begged
him
to
tell
her
what
he
was
talking
about
and
what
he
wanted
them
all
to
do
with
the
child
he
said
i
want
you
to
treat
her
kindly
tenderly
for
such
as
you
see
her
i
m
thinking
of
bringing
her
into
the
mercy
on
us
you
haven
t
proposed
for
her
cried
mme
de
brecourt
no
but
i
ve
sounded
her
sister
as
to
their
dispositions
and
she
tells
me
that
if
i
present
myself
there
will
be
no
her
sister
the
awful
little
woman
with
the
big
head
her
head
s
rather
out
of
drawing
but
it
isn
t
a
part
of
the
affair
she
s
very
inoffensive
she
would
be
devoted
to
for
heaven
s
sake
then
keep
quiet
she
s
as
common
as
a
dressmaker
s
not
when
you
know
her
besides
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
francie
you
couldn
t
find
words
enough
a
moment
ago
to
express
that
francie
s
exquisite
and
now
you
ll
be
so
good
as
to
stick
to
that
come
feel
it
all
since
you
have
such
a
free
do
you
call
her
by
her
little
name
like
that
mme
de
brecourt
asked
giving
him
another
cup
of
tea
only
to
you
she
s
perfectly
simple
it
s
impossible
to
imagine
anything
better
and
think
of
the
delight
of
having
that
charming
object
before
one
s
eyes
always
always
it
makes
a
different
for
mme
brecourt
s
lively
head
tossed
this
argument
as
high
as
if
she
had
carried
a
pair
of
horns
my
poor
child
what
are
you
thinking
of
you
can
t
pick
up
a
wife
like
that
the
first
little
american
that
comes
along
you
know
i
hoped
you
wouldn
t
marry
at
all
what
a
pity
i
think
it
for
a
man
at
any
rate
if
you
expect
us
to
like
miss
what
s
her
name
miss
fancy
all
i
can
say
is
we
won
t
we
can
t
do
that
sort
of
thing
i
shall
marry
her
then
the
young
man
returned
without
your
leave
given
very
good
but
if
she
deprives
you
of
our
approval
you
ve
always
had
it
you
re
used
to
it
and
depend
on
it
it
s
a
part
of
your
life
you
ll
hate
her
like
poison
at
the
end
of
a
i
don
t
care
then
i
shall
have
always
had
my
and
she
poor
thing
poor
thing
exactly
you
ll
begin
to
pity
her
and
that
will
make
you
cultivate
charity
and
cultivate
her
with
it
which
will
then
make
you
find
out
how
adorable
she
is
then
you
ll
like
her
then
you
ll
love
her
then
you
ll
see
what
a
perfect
sense
for
the
right
thing
the
right
thing
for
me
i
ve
had
and
we
shall
all
be
happy
together
but
how
can
you
possibly
know
with
such
people
mme
de
brecourt
demanded
what
you
ve
got
hold
of
by
having
a
feeling
for
what
s
really
what
s
delicately
good
and
charming
you
pretend
to
have
it
and
yet
in
such
a
case
as
this
you
try
to
be
stupid
give
that
up
you
might
as
well
first
as
last
for
the
girl
s
an
exquisite
fact
she
ll
prevail
and
it
will
be
better
to
accept
her
than
to
let
her
accept
mme
de
brecourt
asked
him
if
miss
dosson
had
a
fortune
and
he
said
he
knew
nothing
about
that
her
father
certainly
must
be
rich
but
he
didn
t
mean
to
ask
for
a
penny
with
her
american
fortunes
moreover
were
the
last
things
to
count
upon
a
truth
of
which
they
had
seen
too
many
examples
to
this
his
sister
had
replied
papa
will
never
listen
to
listen
to
what
to
your
not
finding
out
to
your
not
asking
for
settlements
comme
cela
se
pardon
me
papa
will
find
out
for
himself
and
he
ll
know
perfectly
whether
to
ask
or
whether
to
leave
it
alone
that
s
the
sort
of
thing
he
does
know
and
he
knows
quite
as
well
that
i
m
very
difficult
to
you
ll
be
difficult
my
dear
if
we
lose
you
mme
de
brecourt
laughed
to
replace
always
at
any
rate
to
find
a
wife
for
i
m
neither
fish
nor
flesh
i
ve
no
country
no
career
no
future
i
offer
nothing
i
bring
nothing
what
position
under
the
sun
do
i
confer
there
s
a
fatuity
in
our
talking
as
if
we
could
make
grand
terms
you
and
the
others
are
well
enough
qui
prend
mari
prend
pays
and
you
ve
names
about
which
your
husbands
take
a
great
stand
but
papa
and
i
i
ask
you
as
a
family
nous
sommes
said
mme
de
brecourt
you
know
what
we
are
it
doesn
t
need
any
explanation
we
re
as
good
as
anything
there
is
and
have
always
been
thought
so
you
might
do
anything
you
well
i
shall
never
like
to
marry
when
it
comes
to
that
a
thank
you
my
dear
and
mme
de
brecourt
tossed
her
head
no
sister
of
mine
s
really
french
returned
the
young
man
no
brother
of
mine
s
really
mad
marry
whomever
you
like
susan
went
on
only
let
her
be
the
best
of
her
kind
let
her
be
at
least
a
gentlewoman
trust
me
i
ve
studied
life
that
s
the
only
thing
that
s
francie
s
the
equal
of
the
first
lady
in
the
with
that
sister
with
that
hat
never
never
what
s
the
matter
with
her
hat
the
sister
s
told
a
story
it
was
a
document
it
described
them
it
classed
them
and
such
a
patois
as
they
speak
my
dear
her
english
is
quite
as
good
as
yours
you
don
t
even
know
how
bad
yours
is
the
young
man
went
on
with
assurance
well
i
don
t
say
parus
and
i
never
asked
an
englishman
to
marry
me
you
know
what
our
feelings
are
his
companion
as
ardently
pursued
our
convictions
our
susceptibilities
we
may
be
wrong
we
may
be
hollow
we
may
be
pretentious
we
mayn
t
be
able
to
say
on
what
it
all
rests
but
there
we
are
and
the
fact
s
insurmountable
it
s
simply
impossible
for
us
to
live
with
vulgar
people
it
s
a
defect
no
doubt
it
s
an
immense
inconvenience
and
in
the
days
we
live
in
it
s
sadly
against
one
s
interest
but
we
re
made
like
that
and
we
must
understand
ourselves
it
s
of
the
very
essence
of
our
nature
and
of
yours
exactly
as
much
as
of
mine
or
of
that
of
the
others
don
t
make
a
mistake
about
it
you
ll
prepare
for
yourself
a
bitter
future
i
know
what
becomes
of
us
we
suffer
we
go
through
tortures
we
die
the
accent
of
passionate
prophecy
was
in
this
lady
s
voice
but
her
brother
made
her
no
immediate
answer
only
indulging
restlessly
in
several
turns
about
the
room
at
last
he
took
up
his
hat
i
shall
come
to
an
understanding
with
her
and
the
next
day
about
this
hour
i
shall
bring
her
to
see
you
meanwhile
please
say
nothing
to
any
mme
de
brecourt
s
eyes
lingered
on
him
he
had
grasped
the
knob
of
the
door
what
do
you
mean
by
her
father
s
being
certainly
rich
that
s
such
a
vague
term
what
do
you
suppose
his
fortune
to
be
ah
that
s
a
question
she
would
never
ask
her
brother
cried
as
he
left
her
vi
the
next
morning
he
found
himself
seated
on
one
of
the
sofas
beside
dosson
in
this
gentleman
s
private
room
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
delia
and
francie
had
established
their
father
in
the
old
quarters
they
expected
to
finish
the
winter
in
paris
but
had
not
taken
independent
apartments
for
they
had
an
idea
that
when
you
lived
that
way
it
was
grand
but
lonely
you
didn
t
meet
people
on
the
staircase
the
temperature
was
now
such
as
to
deprive
the
good
gentleman
of
his
usual
resource
of
sitting
in
the
court
and
he
had
not
yet
discovered
an
effective
substitute
for
this
recreation
without
flack
at
the
cafes
he
felt
too
much
a
but
he
was
patient
and
ruminant
young
probert
grew
to
like
him
and
tried
to
invent
amusements
for
him
took
him
to
see
the
great
markets
the
sewers
and
the
bank
of
france
and
put
him
with
the
lushest
disinterestedness
in
the
way
of
acquiring
a
beautiful
pair
of
horses
which
dosson
little
as
he
resembles
a
sporting
character
found
it
a
great
resource
on
fine
afternoons
to
drive
with
a
highly
scientific
hand
and
from
a
smart
americaine
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
there
was
a
at
the
bankers
where
he
spent
hours
engaged
in
a
manner
best
known
to
himself
and
he
shared
the
great
interest
the
constant
topic
of
his
daughters
the
portrait
that
was
going
forward
in
the
avenue
de
villiers
this
was
the
subject
round
which
the
thoughts
of
these
young
ladies
clustered
and
their
activity
revolved
it
gave
free
play
to
their
faculty
for
endless
repetition
for
monotonous
insistence
for
vague
and
aimless
discussion
on
leaving
mme
de
brecourt
francie
s
lover
had
written
to
delia
that
he
desired
half
an
hour
s
private
conversation
with
her
father
on
the
morrow
at
eleven
his
impatience
forbade
him
to
wait
for
a
more
canonical
hour
he
asked
her
to
be
so
good
as
to
arrange
that
dosson
should
be
there
to
receive
him
and
to
keep
francie
out
of
the
way
delia
acquitted
herself
to
the
letter
well
sir
what
have
you
got
to
show
asked
francie
s
father
leaning
far
back
on
the
sofa
and
moving
nothing
but
his
head
and
that
very
little
toward
his
interlocutor
gaston
was
placed
sidewise
a
hand
on
each
knee
almost
facing
him
on
the
edge
of
the
seat
to
show
sir
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
do
for
a
living
how
do
you
subsist
oh
comfortably
enough
of
course
it
would
be
remiss
in
you
not
to
satisfy
yourself
on
that
point
my
income
s
derived
from
three
sources
first
some
property
left
me
by
my
dear
mother
second
a
legacy
from
my
poor
brother
he
had
inherited
a
small
fortune
from
an
old
relation
of
ours
who
took
a
great
fancy
to
him
he
went
to
america
to
see
her
which
he
divided
among
the
four
of
us
in
the
will
he
made
at
the
time
of
the
the
war
what
war
asked
dosson
why
the
oh
that
old
war
and
dosson
almost
laughed
well
he
mildly
continued
then
my
father
s
so
good
as
to
make
me
a
decent
allowance
and
some
day
i
shall
have
more
from
dosson
appeared
to
think
these
things
over
why
you
seem
to
have
fixed
it
so
you
live
mostly
on
other
i
shall
never
attempt
to
live
on
you
sir
this
was
spoken
with
some
vivacity
by
our
young
man
he
felt
the
next
moment
that
he
had
said
something
that
might
provoke
a
retort
but
his
companion
showed
no
sharpness
well
i
guess
there
won
t
be
any
trouble
about
that
and
what
does
my
daughter
say
i
haven
t
spoken
to
her
haven
t
spoken
to
the
person
most
interested
i
thought
it
more
orthodox
to
break
ground
with
you
well
when
i
was
after
dosson
i
guess
i
spoke
to
her
quick
enough
francie
s
father
just
a
little
dryly
stated
there
was
an
element
of
reproach
in
this
and
gaston
was
mystified
for
the
question
about
his
means
a
moment
before
had
been
in
the
nature
of
a
challenge
how
will
you
feel
if
she
won
t
have
you
after
you
ve
exposed
yourself
this
way
to
me
dosson
went
on
well
i
ve
a
sort
of
confidence
it
may
be
vain
but
god
grant
not
i
think
she
likes
me
personally
but
what
i
m
afraid
of
is
that
she
may
consider
she
knows
too
little
about
me
she
has
never
seen
my
people
she
doesn
t
know
what
may
be
before
do
you
mean
your
family
the
folks
at
home
said
dosson
don
t
you
believe
that
delia
has
moused
around
she
has
found
out
delia
s
thorough
well
we
re
very
simple
kindly
respectable
people
as
you
ll
see
in
a
day
or
two
for
yourself
my
father
and
sisters
will
do
themselves
the
honour
to
wait
upon
you
the
young
man
announced
with
a
temerity
the
sense
of
which
made
his
voice
tremble
we
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
them
sir
his
host
cheerfully
returned
well
now
let
s
see
the
good
gentleman
socially
mused
don
t
you
expect
to
embrace
any
regular
occupation
gaston
smiled
at
him
as
from
depths
have
you
anything
of
that
sort
sir
well
you
have
me
there
dosson
resignedly
sighed
it
doesn
t
seem
as
if
i
required
anything
i
m
looked
after
so
well
the
fact
is
the
girls
support
i
shall
not
expect
miss
francie
to
support
me
said
gaston
probert
you
re
prepared
to
enable
her
to
live
in
the
style
to
which
she
s
accustomed
and
his
friend
turned
on
him
an
eye
as
of
quite
patient
speculation
well
i
don
t
think
she
ll
miss
anything
that
is
if
she
does
she
ll
find
other
things
i
presume
she
ll
miss
delia
and
even
me
a
little
it
occurred
to
dosson
to
mention
oh
it
s
easy
to
prevent
that
the
young
man
threw
off
well
of
course
we
shall
be
on
after
which
dosson
continued
to
follow
the
subject
as
at
the
same
respectful
distance
you
ll
continue
to
reside
in
paris
i
ll
live
anywhere
in
the
world
she
likes
of
course
my
people
are
here
that
s
a
great
tie
i
m
not
without
hope
that
it
may
with
time
become
a
reason
for
your
daughter
gaston
handsomely
wound
up
oh
any
reason
ll
do
where
paris
is
concerned
take
some
lunch
dosson
added
looking
at
his
watch
they
rose
to
their
feet
but
before
they
had
gone
many
steps
the
meals
of
this
amiable
family
were
now
served
in
an
adjoining
room
the
young
man
stopped
his
companion
i
can
t
tell
you
how
kind
i
think
it
the
way
you
treat
me
and
how
i
m
touched
by
your
confidence
you
take
me
just
as
i
am
with
no
recommendation
beyond
my
own
well
probert
said
his
host
if
we
didn
t
like
you
we
wouldn
t
smile
on
you
recommendations
in
that
case
wouldn
t
be
any
good
and
since
we
do
like
you
there
ain
t
any
call
for
them
either
i
trust
my
daughters
if
i
didn
t
i
d
have
stayed
at
home
and
if
i
trust
them
and
they
trust
you
it
s
the
same
as
if
trusted
you
ain
t
it
i
guess
it
is
gaston
delightedly
smiled
his
companion
laid
a
hand
on
the
door
but
paused
a
moment
now
are
you
very
sure
i
thought
i
was
but
you
make
me
because
there
was
a
gentleman
here
last
year
i
d
have
put
my
money
on
gaston
wondered
a
gentleman
last
year
mr
flack
you
met
him
surely
a
very
fine
man
i
thought
he
rather
hit
it
off
with
seigneur
dieu
gaston
probert
murmured
under
his
breath
dosson
had
opened
the
door
he
made
his
companion
pass
into
the
small
where
the
table
was
spread
for
the
noonday
breakfast
where
are
the
chickens
he
disappointedly
asked
his
visitor
at
first
supposed
him
to
have
missed
a
customary
dish
from
the
board
but
recognised
the
next
moment
his
usual
designation
of
his
daughters
these
young
ladies
presently
came
in
but
francie
looked
away
from
the
suitor
for
her
hand
the
suggestion
just
dropped
by
her
father
had
given
him
a
shock
the
idea
of
the
s
personal
success
with
so
rare
a
creature
was
inconceivable
but
her
charming
way
of
avoiding
his
eye
convinced
him
he
had
nothing
to
really
fear
from
flack
that
night
it
had
been
an
exciting
day
delia
remarked
to
her
sister
that
of
course
she
could
draw
back
upon
which
as
francie
repeated
the
expression
with
her
so
markedly
looser
grasp
you
can
send
him
a
note
saying
you
won
t
delia
explained
won
t
marry
him
gracious
no
won
t
go
to
see
his
sister
you
can
tell
him
it
s
her
place
to
come
to
see
you
oh
i
don
t
care
said
francie
wearily
delia
judged
this
with
all
her
weight
is
that
the
way
you
answered
him
when
he
asked
you
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
he
could
tell
you
if
you
were
to
speak
to
me
that
way
i
guess
i
d
have
said
oh
well
if
you
don
t
want
it
any
more
than
that
well
i
wish
it
was
you
said
francie
that
probert
was
me
no
that
you
were
the
one
he
s
francie
dosson
are
you
thinking
of
flack
her
sister
suddenly
broke
out
no
not
well
then
what
s
the
matter
you
ve
ideas
and
opinions
you
know
whose
place
it
is
and
what
s
due
and
what
ain
t
you
could
meet
them
all
francie
opined
but
delia
was
indifferent
to
this
tribute
why
how
can
you
say
when
that
s
just
what
i
m
trying
to
find
out
it
doesn
t
matter
anyway
it
will
never
come
off
francie
went
on
what
do
you
mean
by
that
he
ll
give
me
up
in
a
few
weeks
i
ll
be
sure
to
do
do
something
well
that
will
break
the
charm
francie
sighed
with
the
sweetest
feeblest
fatalism
if
you
say
that
again
i
shall
think
you
do
it
on
purpose
delia
declared
are
you
thinking
of
george
flack
she
repeated
in
a
moment
oh
do
leave
him
alone
francie
answered
in
one
of
her
rare
irritations
then
why
are
you
so
queer
oh
i
m
tired
and
the
girl
turned
impatiently
away
and
this
was
the
simple
truth
she
was
tired
of
the
consideration
her
sister
saw
fit
to
devote
to
the
question
of
gaston
s
not
having
since
their
return
to
paris
brought
the
old
folks
as
they
used
to
say
at
home
to
see
them
she
was
overdone
with
delia
s
theories
on
this
subject
which
varied
from
the
view
that
he
was
keeping
his
intercourse
with
his
american
friends
unguessed
by
them
because
they
were
uncompromising
in
their
grandeur
to
the
presumption
that
that
grandeur
would
descend
some
day
upon
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
and
carry
francie
away
in
a
blaze
of
glory
sometimes
delia
played
in
her
earnest
way
with
the
idea
that
they
ought
to
make
certain
of
gaston
s
omissions
the
ground
of
a
challenge
at
other
times
she
gave
her
reasons
for
judging
that
they
ought
to
take
no
notice
of
them
francie
in
this
connexion
had
neither
doctrine
nor
instinct
of
her
own
and
now
she
was
all
at
once
happy
and
uneasy
all
at
once
in
love
and
in
doubt
and
in
fear
and
in
a
state
of
native
indifference
her
lover
had
dwelt
to
her
but
little
on
his
domestic
circle
and
she
had
noticed
this
circumstance
the
more
because
of
a
remark
dropped
by
charles
waterlow
to
the
effect
that
he
and
his
father
were
great
friends
the
word
seemed
to
her
odd
in
that
application
she
knew
he
saw
that
gentleman
and
the
types
of
high
fashion
as
she
supposed
probert
s
daughters
very
often
and
she
therefore
took
for
granted
that
they
knew
he
saw
her
but
the
most
he
had
done
was
to
say
they
would
come
and
see
her
like
a
shot
if
once
they
should
believe
they
could
trust
her
she
had
wanted
to
know
what
he
meant
by
their
trusting
her
and
he
had
explained
that
it
would
seem
to
them
too
good
to
be
true
that
she
should
be
kind
to
him
something
exactly
of
that
sort
was
what
they
dreamed
of
for
him
but
they
had
dreamed
before
and
been
disappointed
and
were
now
on
their
guard
from
the
moment
they
should
feel
they
were
on
solid
ground
they
would
join
hands
and
dance
round
her
francie
s
answer
to
this
ingenuity
was
that
she
didn
t
know
what
he
was
talking
about
and
he
indulged
in
no
attempt
on
that
occasion
to
render
his
meaning
more
clear
the
consequence
of
which
was
that
he
felt
he
bore
as
yet
with
an
insufficient
mass
he
cut
to
be
plain
a
poor
figure
his
uneasiness
had
not
passed
away
for
many
things
in
truth
were
dark
to
him
he
couldn
t
see
his
father
fraternising
with
dosson
he
couldn
t
see
margaret
and
jane
recognising
an
alliance
in
which
delia
was
one
of
the
allies
he
had
answered
for
them
because
that
was
the
only
thing
to
do
and
this
only
just
failed
to
be
criminally
reckless
what
saved
it
was
the
hope
he
founded
upon
mme
de
brecourt
and
the
sense
of
how
well
he
could
answer
to
the
others
for
francie
he
considered
that
susan
had
in
her
first
judgement
of
his
young
lady
committed
herself
she
had
really
taken
her
in
and
her
subsequent
protest
when
she
found
what
was
in
his
heart
had
been
a
denial
which
he
would
make
her
in
turn
deny
the
girl
s
slow
sweetness
once
acting
she
would
come
round
a
simple
interview
with
francie
would
suffice
for
this
result
by
the
end
of
half
an
hour
she
should
be
an
enthusiastic
convert
by
the
end
of
an
hour
she
would
believe
she
herself
had
invented
the
match
had
discovered
the
pearl
he
would
pack
her
off
to
the
others
as
the
author
of
the
plan
she
would
take
it
all
upon
herself
would
represent
him
even
as
hanging
a
little
back
she
would
do
nothing
of
that
sort
but
would
boast
of
her
superior
flair
and
would
so
enjoy
the
comedy
as
to
forget
she
had
resisted
him
even
a
moment
the
young
man
had
a
high
sense
of
honour
but
was
ready
in
this
forecast
for
fifty
fibs
vii
it
may
as
well
be
said
at
once
that
his
prevision
was
soon
made
good
and
that
in
the
course
of
a
fortnight
old
probert
and
his
daughters
alighted
successively
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
francie
s
visit
with
her
intended
to
mme
de
brecourt
bore
exactly
the
fruit
her
admirer
had
foretold
and
was
followed
the
very
next
day
by
a
call
from
this
lady
she
took
the
girl
out
with
her
in
her
carriage
and
kept
her
the
whole
afternoon
driving
her
half
over
paris
chattering
with
her
kissing
her
delighting
in
her
telling
her
they
were
already
sisters
paying
her
compliments
that
made
francie
envy
her
art
of
saying
things
as
she
had
never
heard
things
said
for
the
excellent
reason
among
many
that
she
had
never
known
such
things
could
be
after
she
had
dropped
her
charge
this
critic
rushed
off
to
her
father
s
reflecting
with
pleasure
that
at
that
hour
she
should
probably
find
her
sister
marguerite
there
mme
de
cliche
was
with
their
parent
in
fact
she
had
three
days
in
the
week
for
coming
to
the
cours
la
reine
she
sat
near
him
in
the
firelight
telling
him
presumably
her
troubles
for
maxime
de
cliche
having
proved
not
quite
the
pearl
they
had
originally
supposed
mme
de
brecourt
knew
what
marguerite
did
whenever
she
took
that
little
ottoman
and
drew
it
close
to
the
paternal
chair
she
gave
way
to
her
favourite
vice
that
of
dolefulness
which
lengthened
her
long
face
more
it
was
unbecoming
if
she
only
knew
it
the
family
was
intensely
united
as
we
see
but
that
didn
t
prevent
mme
de
brecourt
s
having
a
certain
sympathy
for
maxime
he
too
was
one
of
themselves
and
she
asked
herself
what
she
would
have
done
had
she
been
a
man
with
a
wife
whose
cheeks
were
like
decks
in
a
high
sea
it
was
the
twilight
hour
in
the
winter
days
before
the
lamps
that
especially
brought
her
out
then
she
began
her
long
stories
about
her
complicated
cares
to
which
her
father
listened
with
angelic
patience
mme
de
brecourt
liked
his
particular
room
in
the
old
house
in
the
cours
la
reine
it
reminded
her
of
her
mother
s
life
and
her
young
days
and
her
dead
brother
and
the
feelings
connected
with
her
first
going
into
the
world
alphonse
and
she
had
had
an
apartment
by
her
father
s
kindness
under
the
roof
that
covered
in
associations
as
the
door
of
a
preserves
herbaceous
scents
so
that
she
continued
to
pop
in
and
out
full
of
her
fresh
impressions
of
society
just
as
she
had
done
when
she
was
a
girl
she
broke
into
her
sister
s
confidences
now
she
announced
her
trouvaille
and
did
battle
for
it
bravely
five
days
later
there
had
been
lively
work
in
the
meantime
gaston
turned
so
pale
at
moments
that
she
feared
it
would
all
result
in
a
mortal
illness
for
him
and
marguerite
shed
gallons
of
tears
probert
went
to
see
the
dossons
with
his
son
mme
de
brecourt
paid
them
another
visit
a
real
official
affair
as
she
deemed
it
accompanied
by
her
husband
and
the
baron
de
douves
and
his
wife
written
to
by
gaston
by
his
father
and
by
margaret
and
susan
came
up
from
the
country
full
of
anxious
participation
de
douves
was
the
person
who
took
the
family
all
round
most
seriously
and
who
most
deprecated
any
sign
of
crude
or
precipitate
action
he
was
a
very
small
black
gentleman
with
thick
eyebrows
and
high
heels
in
the
country
and
the
mud
he
wore
sabots
with
straw
in
them
who
was
suspected
by
his
friends
of
believing
that
he
looked
like
louis
xiv
it
is
perhaps
a
proof
that
something
of
the
quality
of
this
monarch
was
really
recognised
in
him
that
no
one
had
ever
ventured
to
clear
up
this
point
by
a
question
la
famille
c
est
moi
appeared
to
be
his
tacit
formula
and
he
carried
his
umbrella
he
had
very
bad
ones
gaston
thought
with
something
of
a
sceptral
air
mme
de
brecourt
went
so
far
as
to
believe
that
his
wife
in
confirmation
of
this
took
herself
for
a
species
of
mme
de
maintenon
she
had
lapsed
into
a
provincial
existence
as
she
might
have
harked
back
to
the
seventeenth
century
the
world
she
lived
in
seemed
about
as
far
away
she
was
the
largest
heaviest
member
of
the
family
and
in
the
vendee
was
thought
majestic
despite
the
old
clothes
she
fondly
affected
and
which
added
to
her
look
of
having
come
down
from
a
remote
past
or
reverted
to
it
she
was
at
bottom
an
excellent
woman
but
she
wrote
roy
and
foy
like
her
husband
and
the
action
of
her
mind
was
wholly
restricted
to
questions
of
relationship
and
alliance
she
had
extraordinary
patience
of
research
and
tenacity
of
grasp
for
a
clue
and
viewed
people
solely
in
the
light
projected
upon
them
by
others
that
is
not
as
good
or
wicked
ugly
or
handsome
wise
or
foolish
but
as
grandsons
nephews
uncles
and
aunts
brothers
and
cousins
and
second
cousins
you
might
have
supposed
to
listen
to
her
that
human
beings
were
susceptible
of
no
attribute
but
that
of
a
dwindling
or
thickening
consanguinity
there
was
a
certain
expectation
that
she
would
leave
rather
formidable
memoirs
in
mme
de
brecourt
s
eyes
this
pair
were
very
shabby
they
didn
t
payer
de
mine
they
fairly
smelt
of
their
province
but
for
the
reality
of
the
thing
she
often
said
to
herself
they
re
worth
all
of
us
we
re
diluted
and
they
re
pure
and
any
one
with
an
eye
would
see
the
thing
was
the
legitimist
principle
the
ancient
faith
and
even
a
little
the
right
the
unconscious
grand
air
the
marquis
de
cliche
did
his
duty
with
his
wife
who
mopped
the
decks
as
susan
said
for
the
occasion
and
was
entertained
in
the
by
dosson
delia
and
francie
dosson
had
wanted
and
proposed
to
be
somewhere
else
when
he
heard
of
the
approach
of
gaston
s
relations
and
the
fond
youth
had
to
instruct
him
that
this
wouldn
t
do
the
apartment
in
question
had
had
a
range
of
vision
but
had
probably
never
witnessed
stranger
doings
than
these
laudable
social
efforts
gaston
was
taught
to
feel
that
his
family
had
made
a
great
sacrifice
for
him
but
in
a
very
few
days
he
said
to
himself
that
now
they
knew
the
worst
he
was
safe
they
made
the
sacrifice
they
definitely
agreed
to
it
but
they
thought
proper
he
should
measure
the
full
extent
of
it
gaston
must
never
never
never
be
allowed
to
forget
what
we
ve
done
for
him
mme
de
brecourt
told
him
that
marguerite
de
cliche
had
expressed
herself
in
that
sense
at
one
of
the
family
conclaves
from
which
he
was
absent
these
high
commissions
sat
for
several
days
with
great
frequency
and
the
young
man
could
feel
that
if
there
was
help
for
him
in
discussion
his
case
was
promising
he
flattered
himself
that
he
showed
infinite
patience
and
tact
and
his
expenditure
of
the
latter
quality
in
particular
was
in
itself
his
only
reward
for
it
was
impossible
he
should
tell
francie
what
arts
he
had
to
practise
for
her
he
liked
to
think
however
that
he
practised
them
successfully
for
he
held
that
it
was
by
such
arts
the
civilised
man
is
distinguished
from
the
savage
what
they
cost
him
was
made
up
simply
in
this
that
his
private
irritation
produced
a
degree
of
adoptive
heat
in
regard
to
dosson
and
delia
whom
he
could
neither
justify
nor
coherently
account
for
nor
make
people
like
but
whom
he
had
ended
after
so
many
days
of
familiar
intercourse
by
liking
extremely
himself
the
way
to
get
on
with
them
it
was
an
immense
simplification
was
just
to
love
them
one
could
do
that
even
if
one
couldn
t
converse
with
them
he
succeeded
in
making
mme
de
brecourt
seize
this
nuance
she
embraced
the
idea
with
her
quick
inflammability
yes
she
said
we
must
insist
on
their
positive
not
on
their
negative
merits
their
infinite
generosity
their
untutored
their
intensely
native
and
instinctive
delicacy
ah
their
charming
primitive
instincts
we
must
work
those
and
the
brother
and
sister
excited
each
other
magnanimously
to
this
undertaking
sometimes
it
must
be
added
they
exchanged
a
look
that
seemed
to
sound
with
a
slight
alarm
the
depth
of
their
responsibility
on
the
day
probert
called
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
with
his
son
the
pair
walked
away
together
back
to
the
cours
la
reine
without
immediate
comments
the
only
words
uttered
were
three
or
four
of
probert
s
with
gaston
s
rejoinder
as
they
crossed
the
place
de
la
concorde
we
should
have
to
have
them
to
the
young
man
noted
his
father
s
conditional
as
if
his
assent
to
the
strange
alliance
were
not
yet
complete
but
he
guessed
all
the
same
that
the
sight
of
them
had
not
made
a
difference
for
the
worse
they
had
let
the
old
gentleman
down
more
easily
than
was
to
have
been
feared
the
call
had
had
above
all
the
immense
luck
that
it
hadn
t
been
noisy
a
confusion
of
underbred
sounds
which
was
very
happy
for
probert
was
particular
in
this
he
could
bear
french
noise
but
couldn
t
for
the
life
of
him
bear
american
as
for
english
he
maintained
that
there
was
no
such
thing
england
was
a
country
with
the
straw
down
in
all
the
thoroughfares
of
talk
dosson
had
scarcely
spoken
and
yet
had
remained
perfectly
placid
which
was
exactly
what
gaston
would
have
chosen
no
hauteur
could
have
matched
it
he
had
gone
so
little
out
of
his
way
francie
s
lover
knew
moreover
though
he
was
a
little
disappointed
that
no
charmed
exclamation
should
have
been
dropped
as
they
quitted
the
hotel
that
the
girl
s
rare
spell
had
worked
it
was
impossible
the
old
man
shouldn
t
have
liked
her
ah
do
ask
them
and
let
it
be
very
soon
he
replied
they
ll
like
it
so
and
whom
can
they
meet
who
can
meet
them
only
the
family
all
of
us
au
complet
other
people
we
can
have
all
of
us
au
complet
that
makes
eight
and
the
three
of
them
said
probert
then
he
added
poor
creatures
the
fine
ironic
humane
sound
of
it
gave
gaston
much
pleasure
he
passed
his
hand
into
his
father
s
arm
it
promised
well
it
made
the
intelligent
the
tender
allowance
for
the
dear
little
dossons
confronted
with
a
row
of
fierce
french
critics
judged
by
standards
they
had
never
even
heard
of
the
meeting
of
the
two
parents
had
not
made
the
problem
of
their
commerce
any
more
clear
but
our
youth
was
reminded
afresh
by
his
elder
s
hinted
pity
his
breathed
charity
of
the
latent
liberality
that
was
really
what
he
had
built
on
the
dear
old
governor
goodness
knew
had
prejudices
and
superstitions
but
if
they
were
numerous
and
some
of
them
very
curious
they
were
not
rigid
he
had
also
such
nice
inconsistent
feelings
such
irrepressible
indulgences
such
humorous
deviations
and
they
would
ease
everything
off
he
was
in
short
an
old
darling
and
with
an
old
darling
in
the
long
run
one
was
always
safe
when
they
reached
the
house
in
the
cours
la
reine
probert
said
i
think
you
told
me
you
re
dining
yes
with
our
our
friends
comme
vous
y
allez
come
in
and
see
me
then
on
your
return
but
not
later
than
from
this
the
young
man
saw
he
had
swallowed
the
dose
if
he
had
found
it
refuse
to
go
down
he
would
have
cried
for
relief
without
delay
this
reflexion
was
highly
agreeable
for
gaston
perfectly
knew
how
little
he
himself
would
have
enjoyed
a
struggle
he
would
have
carried
it
through
but
he
couldn
t
bear
to
think
of
that
and
the
sense
of
the
further
arguments
he
was
spared
made
him
feel
at
peace
with
all
the
world
the
dinner
at
the
hotel
became
the
gayest
of
banquets
in
honour
of
this
state
of
things
especially
as
francie
and
delia
raved
as
they
said
about
his
poppa
well
i
expected
something
nice
but
he
goes
far
beyond
delia
declared
that
s
my
idea
of
a
real
ah
for
that
said
gaston
he
s
too
sweet
for
anything
i
m
not
a
bit
afraid
of
him
francie
contributed
why
in
the
world
should
you
be
well
i
am
of
you
the
girl
professed
much
you
show
it
her
lover
returned
yes
i
am
she
insisted
at
the
bottom
of
well
that
s
what
a
lady
should
be
afraid
of
her
lord
and
well
i
don
t
know
i
m
more
afraid
than
that
you
ll
i
wish
you
were
afraid
of
talking
nonsense
said
happy
gaston
dosson
made
no
observation
whatever
about
their
grave
bland
visitor
he
listened
in
genial
unprejudiced
silence
it
was
a
sign
of
his
prospective
s
perfect
comprehension
of
him
that
gaston
knew
this
silence
not
to
be
in
any
degree
restrictive
it
didn
t
at
all
mean
he
hadn
t
been
pleased
dosson
had
nothing
to
say
because
nothing
had
been
given
him
he
hadn
t
like
his
so
young
friend
a
sensitive
plate
for
a
brain
and
the
important
events
of
his
life
had
never
been
personal
impressions
his
mind
had
had
absolutely
no
history
with
which
anything
occurring
in
the
present
connexion
could
be
continuous
and
probert
s
appearance
had
neither
founded
a
state
nor
produced
a
revolution
if
the
young
man
had
asked
him
how
he
liked
his
father
he
would
have
said
at
the
most
oh
i
guess
he
s
all
right
but
what
was
more
touchingly
candid
even
than
this
in
gaston
s
view
was
the
attitude
of
the
good
gentleman
and
his
daughters
toward
the
others
mesdames
de
douves
de
brecourt
and
de
cliche
and
their
husbands
who
had
now
all
filed
before
them
they
believed
the
ladies
and
the
gentlemen
alike
to
have
covered
them
with
frank
endearments
to
have
been
artlessly
and
gushingly
glad
to
make
their
acquaintance
they
had
not
in
the
least
seen
what
was
manner
the
minimum
of
decent
profession
and
what
the
subtle
resignation
of
old
races
who
have
known
a
long
historical
discipline
and
have
conventional
forms
and
tortuous
channels
and
grimacing
masks
for
their
impulses
forms
resembling
singularly
little
the
feelings
themselves
francie
took
people
at
their
word
when
they
told
her
that
the
whole
maniere
d
etre
of
her
family
inspired
them
with
an
irresistible
sympathy
that
was
a
speech
of
which
mme
de
cliche
had
been
capable
speaking
as
if
for
all
the
proberts
and
for
the
old
noblesse
of
france
it
wouldn
t
have
occurred
to
the
girl
that
such
things
need
have
been
said
as
for
mere
frilling
and
finish
her
lover
whose
life
affected
her
as
a
picture
of
high
price
in
itself
but
set
in
a
frame
too
big
and
too
heavy
for
it
and
who
therefore
might
have
taken
for
granted
any
amount
of
gilding
yet
made
his
reflexions
on
it
now
he
noticed
how
a
manner
might
be
a
very
misleading
symbol
might
cover
pitfalls
and
bottomless
gulfs
when
it
had
reached
that
perfection
and
corresponded
so
little
to
fact
what
he
had
wanted
was
that
his
people
should
be
as
easy
as
they
could
see
their
way
to
being
but
with
such
a
high
standard
of
compliment
where
after
all
was
sincerity
and
without
sincerity
how
could
people
get
on
together
when
it
came
to
their
settling
down
to
common
life
then
the
dossons
might
have
surprises
and
the
surprises
would
be
painful
in
proportion
as
their
present
innocence
was
great
as
to
the
high
standard
itself
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
there
ought
to
be
preserved
examples
of
that
perfection
viii
when
on
coming
home
again
this
evening
meanwhile
he
complied
with
his
father
s
request
by
returning
to
the
room
in
which
the
old
man
habitually
sat
probert
laid
down
his
book
and
kept
on
his
glasses
of
course
you
ll
continue
to
live
with
me
you
ll
understand
that
i
don
t
consent
to
your
going
away
you
ll
have
the
rooms
occupied
at
first
by
susan
and
gaston
noted
with
pleasure
the
transition
from
the
conditional
to
the
future
tense
and
also
the
circumstance
that
his
father
had
been
lost
in
a
book
according
to
his
now
confirmed
custom
of
evening
ease
this
proved
him
not
too
much
off
the
hinge
he
read
a
great
deal
and
very
serious
books
works
about
the
origin
of
things
of
man
of
institutions
of
speech
of
religion
this
habit
he
had
taken
up
more
particularly
since
the
circle
of
his
social
life
had
contracted
he
sat
there
alone
turning
his
pages
softly
contentedly
with
the
lamplight
shining
on
his
refined
old
head
and
embroidered
he
had
used
of
old
to
be
out
every
night
in
the
week
gaston
was
perfectly
aware
that
to
many
dull
people
he
must
even
have
appeared
a
little
frivolous
he
was
essentially
a
social
creature
and
indeed
except
perhaps
poor
jane
in
her
damp
old
castle
in
brittany
they
were
all
social
creatures
that
was
doubtless
part
of
the
reason
why
the
family
had
acclimatised
itself
in
france
they
had
affinities
with
a
society
of
conversation
they
liked
general
talk
and
old
high
salons
slightly
tarnished
and
dim
containing
precious
relics
where
winged
words
flew
about
through
a
circle
round
the
fire
and
some
clever
person
before
the
held
or
challenged
the
others
that
figure
gaston
knew
especially
in
the
days
before
he
could
see
for
himself
had
very
often
been
his
father
the
lightest
and
most
amiable
specimen
of
the
type
that
enjoyed
easy
possession
of
the
people
left
it
to
him
he
was
so
transparent
like
a
glass
screen
and
he
never
triumphed
in
debate
his
word
on
most
subjects
was
not
felt
to
be
the
last
it
was
usually
not
more
conclusive
than
a
shrugging
inarticulate
resignation
an
ah
you
know
what
will
you
have
but
he
had
been
none
the
less
a
part
of
the
very
prestige
of
some
dozen
good
houses
most
of
them
over
the
river
in
the
conservative
faubourg
and
several
profaned
shrines
cold
and
desolate
hearths
these
had
made
up
probert
s
pleasant
world
a
world
not
too
small
for
him
and
yet
not
too
large
though
some
of
them
supposed
themselves
great
institutions
gaston
knew
the
succession
of
events
that
had
helped
to
make
a
difference
the
most
salient
of
which
were
the
death
of
his
brother
the
death
of
his
mother
and
above
all
perhaps
the
demise
of
mme
de
marignac
to
whom
the
old
boy
used
still
to
go
three
or
four
evenings
out
of
the
seven
and
sometimes
even
in
the
morning
besides
gaston
fully
measured
the
place
she
had
held
in
his
father
s
life
and
affection
and
the
terms
on
which
they
had
grown
up
together
her
people
had
been
friends
of
his
grandfather
when
that
fine
old
southern
worthy
came
a
widower
with
a
young
son
and
several
negroes
to
take
his
pleasure
in
paris
in
the
time
of
louis
philippe
and
the
devoted
part
she
had
played
in
marrying
his
sisters
he
was
quite
aware
that
her
friendship
and
all
its
exertions
were
often
mentioned
as
explaining
their
position
so
remarkable
in
a
society
in
which
they
had
begun
after
all
as
outsiders
but
he
would
have
guessed
even
if
he
had
not
been
told
what
his
father
said
to
that
to
offer
the
proberts
a
position
was
to
carry
water
to
the
fountain
they
hadn
t
left
their
own
behind
them
in
carolina
it
had
been
large
enough
to
stretch
across
the
sea
as
to
what
it
was
in
carolina
there
was
no
need
of
being
explicit
this
adoptive
parisian
was
by
nature
presupposing
but
he
was
admirably
urbane
that
was
why
they
let
him
talk
so
before
the
fire
he
was
the
oracle
persuasive
the
conciliatory
voice
and
after
the
death
of
his
wife
and
of
mme
de
marignac
who
had
been
her
friend
too
the
young
man
s
mother
s
he
was
gentler
if
more
detached
than
before
gaston
had
already
felt
him
to
care
in
consequence
less
for
everything
except
indeed
for
the
true
faith
to
which
he
drew
still
closer
and
this
increase
of
indifference
doubtless
helped
to
explain
his
present
charming
accommodation
we
shall
be
thankful
for
any
rooms
you
may
give
us
his
son
said
we
shall
fill
out
the
house
a
little
and
won
t
that
be
rather
an
improvement
shrunken
as
you
and
i
have
become
you
ll
fill
it
out
a
good
deal
i
suppose
with
dosson
and
the
other
ah
francie
won
t
give
up
her
father
and
sister
certainly
and
what
should
you
think
of
her
if
she
did
but
they
re
not
intrusive
they
re
essentially
modest
people
they
won
t
put
themselves
upon
us
they
have
great
natural
discretion
gaston
declared
do
you
answer
for
that
susan
does
she
s
always
assuring
one
of
it
probert
said
the
father
has
so
much
that
he
wouldn
t
even
speak
to
he
didn
t
poor
dear
man
know
what
to
how
then
shall
i
know
what
to
say
to
him
ah
you
always
know
gaston
smiled
how
will
that
help
us
if
he
doesn
t
know
what
to
answer
you
ll
draw
him
out
he
s
full
of
a
funny
little
shade
of
well
i
won
t
quarrel
with
your
bonhomme
said
probert
if
he
s
silent
there
are
much
worse
faults
nor
yet
with
the
fat
young
lady
though
she
s
evidently
vulgar
even
if
you
call
it
perhaps
too
a
funny
little
shade
it
s
not
for
ourselves
i
m
afraid
it
s
for
them
they
ll
be
very
never
never
said
gaston
they
re
too
simple
they
ll
remain
so
they
re
not
morbid
nor
suspicious
and
don
t
you
like
francie
you
haven
t
told
me
so
he
added
in
a
moment
she
talks
about
parus
my
dear
ah
to
susan
too
that
seemed
the
great
barrier
but
she
has
got
over
it
i
mean
susan
has
got
over
the
barrier
we
shall
make
her
speak
french
she
has
a
real
disposition
for
it
her
french
is
already
almost
as
good
as
her
that
oughtn
t
to
be
difficult
what
will
you
have
of
course
she
s
very
pretty
and
i
m
sure
she
s
good
but
i
won
t
tell
you
she
is
a
marvel
because
you
must
remember
you
young
fellows
think
your
own
point
of
view
and
your
own
experience
everything
that
i
ve
seen
beauties
without
number
i
ve
known
the
most
charming
women
of
our
time
women
of
an
order
to
which
miss
francie
con

will
never
begin

i
m
difficult
about

how
can
i
help
it
therefore
when
you
pick
up
a
little
american
girl
at
an
inn
and
bring
her
to
us
as
a
miracle
feel
how
standards

j

however
i
accept
everything
as
you
know
when
once
one
has
lost
one
s
enthusiasm
everything
s
the
same
and
one
might
as
well

by
the
sword
as
by
i
hoped
she
d
fascinate
you
on
the
spot
gaston
rather
ruefully
remarked

how
many
times
in

life

to

she

she

at

that
she
doesn

i
ll
engage
for
that
said
probert
handsomely
ah
be
sincere
with
her
father
she
s
worth
it
his
son
broke
out
when
the
elder
man
took
that
tone
the
tone
of
vast
experience
and
a
fastidiousness
justified
by
ineffable
recollections
our
friend
was
more
provoked
than
he
could
say
though
he
was
also
considerably
amused
for
he
had
a
good
while
since
made
up
his
mind
about
the
element
of
rather
stupid
convention
in
it
it
was
fatuous
to
miss
so
little
the
fine
perceptions
one
didn
t
have
so
far
from
its
showing
experience
it
showed
a
sad
simplicity
not
to
feel
francie
dosson
he
thanked
god
she
was
just
the
sort
of
imponderable
infinite
quantity
such
as
there
were
no
stupid
terms
for
that
he
did
feel
he
didn
t
know
what
old
frumps
his
father
might
have
frequented
the
style
of
with
long
curls
in
front
a
vapid
simper
a
scotch
plaid
dress
and
a
corsage
in
a
point
suggestive
of
twenty
whalebones
coming
down
to
the
knees
but
he
could
remember
mme
de
marignac
s
tuesdays
and
thursdays
and
fridays
with
sundays
and
other
days
thrown
in
and
the
taste
that
prevailed
in
that
milieu
the
books
they
admired
the
verses
they
read
and
recited
the
pictures
great
heaven
they
thought
good
and
the
three
busts
of
the
lady
of
the
house
in
different
corners
as
a
diana
a
druidess
and
a
croyante
her
shoulders
were
supposed
to
make
up
for
her
head
effigies
the
public
ridicule
attaching
to
which
would
even
the
least
bad
canova
s
make
their
authors
burrow
in
holes
for
shame
and
what
else
is
she
worth
probert
asked
after
a
momentary
hesitation
how
do
you
mean
what
else
her
immense
prospects
that
s
what
susan
has
been
putting
forward
susan
s
insistence
on
them
was
mainly
what
brought
over
jane
do
you
mind
my
speaking
of
them
gaston
was
obliged
to
recognise
privately
the
importance
of
jane
s
having
been
brought
over
but
he
hated
to
hear
it
spoken
of
as
if
he
were
under
an
obligation
to
it
to
whom
sir
he
asked
oh
only
to
you
can
t
do
less
than
dosson
as
i
told
you
he
waived
the
question
of
money
and
he
was
splendid
we
can
t
be
more
mercenary
than
he
waived
the
question
of
his
own
you
mean
said
probert
yes
and
of
yours
but
it
will
be
all
the
young
man
flattered
himself
that
this
was
as
near
as
he
was
willing
to
go
to
any
view
of
pecuniary
convenience
well
it
s
your
affair
or
your
sisters
his
father
returned
it
s
their
idea
that
we
see
where
we
are
and
that
we
make
the
best
of
it
s
very
good
of
them
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
i
should
think
they
d
be
tired
of
their
own
chatter
gaston
impatiently
sighed
probert
looked
at
him
a
moment
in
vague
surprise
but
only
said
i
think
they
are
however
the
period
of
discussion
s
closed
we
ve
taken
the
he
then
added
as
to
put
the
matter
a
little
less
dryly
alphonse
and
maxime
are
quite
of
your
of
my
opinion
that
she
s
confound
them
then
i
m
not
of
theirs
the
form
of
this
rejoinder
was
childishly
perverse
and
it
made
probert
stare
again
but
it
belonged
to
one
of
the
reasons
for
which
his
children
regarded
him
as
an
old
darling
that
gaston
could
suppose
him
after
an
instant
to
embrace
it
the
old
man
said
nothing
but
took
up
his
book
and
his
son
who
had
been
standing
before
the
fire
went
out
of
the
room
his
abstention
from
protest
at
gaston
s
petulance
was
the
more
generous
as
he
was
capable
for
his
part
of
feeling
it
to
make
for
a
greater
amenity
in
the
whole
connexion
that
ces
messieurs
should
like
the
little
girl
at
the
hotel
gaston
didn
t
care
a
straw
what
it
made
for
and
would
have
seen
himself
in
bondage
indeed
had
he
given
a
second
thought
to
the
question
this
was
especially
the
case
as
his
father
s
mention
of
the
approval
of
two
of
his
appeared
to
point
to
a
possible
disapproval
on
the
part
of
the
third
francie
s
lover
cared
as
little
whether
she
displeased
de
brecourt
as
he
cared
whether
she
pleased
maxime
and
raoul
probert
continued
to
read
and
in
a
few
moments
gaston
was
with
him
again
he
had
expressed
surprise
just
before
at
the
wealth
of
discussion
his
sisters
had
been
ready
to
expend
in
his
interest
but
he
managed
to
convey
now
that
there
was
still
a
point
of
a
certain
importance
to
be
made
it
seems
rather
odd
to
me
that
you
should
all
appear
to
accept
the
step
i
m
about
to
take
as
a
necessity
disagreeable
at
the
best
when
i
myself
hold
that
i
ve
been
so
exceedingly
probert
lowered
his
book
accommodatingly
and
rested
his
eyes
on
the
fire
you
won
t
be
content
till
we
re
enthusiastic
she
seems
an
amiable
girl
certainly
and
in
that
you
re
i
don
t
think
you
can
tell
me
what
would
be
better
what
you
d
have
preferred
the
young
man
said
what
i
should
have
preferred
in
the
first
place
you
must
remember
that
i
wasn
t
madly
impatient
to
see
you
i
can
imagine
that
and
yet
i
can
t
imagine
that
as
things
have
turned
out
you
shouldn
t
be
struck
with
my
felicity
to
get
something
so
charming
and
to
get
it
of
our
own
species
gaston
explained
of
our
own
species
tudieu
said
his
father
looking
up
surely
it
s
infinitely
fresher
and
more
amusing
for
me
to
marry
an
american
there
s
a
sad
want
of
freshness
there
s
even
a
provinciality
in
the
way
we
ve
against
americans
i
ve
nothing
to
say
some
of
them
are
the
best
thing
the
world
contains
that
s
precisely
why
one
can
choose
they
re
far
from
doing
all
like
like
what
dear
father
comme
ces
you
know
that
if
they
were
french
being
otherwise
what
they
are
one
wouldn
t
look
at
indeed
one
would
they
would
be
such
rare
well
perhaps
they
ll
do
for
queer
fish
said
probert
with
a
little
conclusive
sigh
yes
let
them
pass
at
that
they
ll
surprise
not
too
much
i
hope
cried
the
old
man
opening
his
volume
again
the
complexity
of
things
among
the
proberts
it
needn
t
nevertheless
startle
us
to
learn
was
such
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
gaston
to
proceed
to
the
celebration
of
his
nuptial
with
all
the
needful
circumstances
of
material
preparation
and
social
support
before
some
three
months
should
have
expired
he
chafed
however
but
moderately
under
this
condition
for
he
remembered
it
would
give
francie
time
to
endear
herself
to
his
whole
circle
it
would
also
have
advantages
for
the
dossons
it
would
enable
them
to
establish
by
simple
but
effective
arts
some
modus
vivendi
with
that
rigid
body
it
would
in
short
help
every
one
to
get
used
to
everything
dosson
s
designs
and
delia
s
took
no
articulate
form
what
was
mainly
clear
to
gaston
was
that
his
future
wife
s
relatives
had
as
yet
no
sense
of
disconnexion
he
knew
that
dosson
would
do
whatever
delia
liked
and
that
delia
would
like
to
start
her
sister
this
whether
or
no
she
expected
to
be
present
at
the
rest
of
the
race
probert
notified
dosson
of
what
he
proposed
to
do
for
his
son
and
dosson
appeared
more
quietly
amused
than
anything
else
at
the
news
he
announced
in
return
no
intentions
in
regard
to
francie
and
his
strange
silence
was
the
cause
of
another
convocation
of
the
house
of
probert
here
mme
de
brecourt
s
bold
front
won
another
victory
she
maintained
as
she
let
her
brother
know
that
it
was
too
late
for
any
policy
but
a
policy
of
confidence
lord
help
us
is
that
what
they
call
confidence
the
young
man
gasped
guessing
the
way
they
all
had
looked
at
each
other
and
he
wondered
how
they
would
look
next
at
poor
dosson
himself
fortunately
he
could
always
fall
back
for
reassurance
on
the
perfection
of
their
forms
though
indeed
he
thoroughly
knew
that
these
forms
would
never
appear
so
striking
as
on
the
day
should
such
a
day
fatally
come
of
their
meddling
too
much
probert
s
property
was
altogether
in
the
united
states
he
resembled
other
discriminating
persons
for
whom
the
only
good
taste
in
america
was
the
taste
of
invested
and
paying
capital
the
provisions
he
was
engaging
to
make
for
his
son
s
marriage
rendered
advisable
some
attention
on
the
spot
to
interests
with
the
management
of
which
he
was
acquainted
only
by
report
it
had
long
been
his
conviction
that
his
affairs
beyond
the
sea
needed
looking
into
they
had
gone
on
and
on
for
years
too
far
from
the
master
s
eye
he
had
thought
of
making
the
journey
in
the
cause
of
that
vigilance
but
now
he
was
too
old
and
too
tired
and
the
effort
had
become
impossible
there
was
nothing
therefore
but
for
gaston
to
go
and
go
quickly
though
the
time
so
little
fostered
his
absence
from
paris
the
duty
was
none
the
less
laid
upon
him
and
the
question
practically
faced
then
everything
yielded
to
the
consideration
that
he
had
best
wait
till
after
his
marriage
when
he
might
be
so
auspiciously
accompanied
by
his
wife
francie
would
be
in
many
ways
so
propitious
an
introducer
this
abatement
would
have
taken
effect
had
not
a
call
for
an
equal
energy
on
dosson
s
part
suddenly
appeared
to
reach
and
to
move
that
gentleman
he
had
business
on
the
other
side
he
announced
to
attend
to
though
his
starting
for
new
york
presented
difficulties
since
he
couldn
t
in
such
a
situation
leave
his
daughters
alone
not
only
would
such
a
proceeding
have
given
scandal
to
the
proberts
but
gaston
learned
with
much
surprise
and
not
a
little
amusement
that
delia
in
consequence
of
changes
now
finely
wrought
in
her
personal
philosophy
wouldn
t
have
felt
his
doing
so
square
with
propriety
the
young
man
was
able
to
put
it
to
her
that
nothing
would
be
simpler
than
in
the
interval
for
francie
to
go
and
stay
with
susan
or
margaret
she
herself
in
that
case
would
be
free
to
accompany
her
father
but
delia
declared
at
this
that
nothing
would
induce
her
to
budge
from
paris
till
she
had
seen
her
sister
through
and
gaston
shrank
from
proposing
that
she
too
should
spend
five
weeks
in
the
place
beauvau
or
the
rue
de
lille
there
was
moreover
a
slight
element
of
the
mystifying
for
him
in
the
perverse
unsociable
way
in
which
francie
took
up
a
position
of
marked
disfavour
as
yet
to
any
after
if
he
liked
but
not
till
then
and
she
wouldn
t
at
the
moment
give
the
reasons
of
her
refusal
it
was
only
very
positive
and
even
quite
passionate
all
this
left
her
troubled
suitor
no
alternative
but
to
say
to
dosson
i
m
not
my
dear
sir
such
a
fool
as
i
look
if
you
ll
coach
me
properly
and
trust
me
why
shouldn
t
i
rush
across
and
transact
your
business
as
well
as
my
father
s
strange
as
it
appeared
francie
offered
herself
as
accepting
this
separation
from
her
lover
which
would
last
six
or
seven
weeks
rather
than
accept
the
hospitality
of
any
member
of
his
family
dosson
on
his
side
was
grateful
for
the
solution
he
remarked
well
sir
you
ve
got
a
big
brain
at
the
end
of
a
morning
they
spent
with
papers
and
pencils
and
on
this
gaston
made
his
preparations
to
sail
before
he
left
paris
francie
to
do
her
justice
confided
to
him
that
her
objection
to
going
in
such
an
intimate
way
even
to
mme
de
brecourt
s
had
been
founded
on
a
fear
that
in
close
quarters
she
might
do
something
that
would
make
them
all
despise
her
gaston
replied
in
the
first
place
ardently
that
this
was
the
very
delirium
of
delicacy
and
that
he
wanted
to
know
in
the
second
if
she
expected
never
to
be
at
close
quarters
with
tous
les
ah
yes
but
then
it
will
be
safer
she
pleaded
then
we
shall
be
married
and
by
so
much
shan
t
we
be
beyond
in
rejoinder
to
which
he
had
simply
kissed
her
the
passage
taking
place
three
days
before
her
lover
took
ship
what
further
befell
in
the
brief
interval
was
that
stopping
for
a
last
word
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
the
cheltenham
on
his
way
to
catch
the
night
express
to
london
he
was
to
sail
from
liverpool
gaston
found
george
flack
sitting
in
the
saloon
the
correspondent
of
the
reverberator
had
come
back
ix
flack
s
relations
with
his
old
friends
didn
t
indeed
after
his
return
take
on
the
familiarity
and
frequency
of
their
intercourse
a
year
before
he
was
the
first
to
refer
to
the
marked
change
in
the
situation
they
had
got
into
the
high
set
and
they
didn
t
care
about
the
past
he
alluded
to
the
past
as
if
it
had
been
rich
in
mutual
vows
in
pledges
now
repudiated
what
s
the
matter
all
the
same
won
t
you
come
round
there
with
us
some
day
dosson
asked
not
having
perceived
for
himself
any
reason
why
the
young
journalist
shouldn
t
be
a
welcome
and
easy
presence
in
the
cours
la
reine
delia
wanted
to
know
what
flack
was
talking
about
didn
t
he
know
a
lot
of
people
that
they
didn
t
know
and
wasn
t
it
natural
they
should
have
their
own
society
the
young
man
s
treatment
of
the
question
was
humorous
and
it
was
with
delia
that
the
discussion
mainly
went
forward
when
he
maintained
that
the
dossons
had
shamelessly
shed
him
dosson
returned
well
i
guess
you
ll
grow
again
and
francie
made
the
point
that
it
was
no
use
for
him
to
pose
as
a
martyr
since
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
with
all
the
celebrated
people
he
saw
and
the
way
he
flew
round
he
had
the
most
enchanting
time
she
was
aware
of
being
a
good
deal
less
accessible
than
the
previous
spring
for
mesdames
de
brecourt
and
de
cliche
the
former
indeed
more
than
the
latter
occupied
many
of
her
hours
in
spite
of
her
having
held
off
to
gaston
from
a
premature
intimacy
with
his
sisters
she
spent
whole
days
in
their
company
they
had
so
much
to
tell
her
of
how
her
new
life
would
shape
and
it
seemed
mostly
very
pleasant
and
she
thought
nothing
could
be
nicer
than
that
in
these
intervals
he
should
give
himself
to
her
father
and
even
to
delia
as
had
been
his
wont
but
the
flaw
of
a
certain
insincerity
in
flack
s
nature
was
suggested
by
his
present
tendency
to
rare
visits
he
evidently
didn
t
care
for
her
father
in
himself
and
though
this
mild
parent
always
took
what
was
set
before
him
and
never
made
fusses
she
is
sure
he
felt
their
old
companion
to
have
fallen
away
there
were
no
more
wanderings
in
public
places
no
more
tryings
of
new
cafes
dosson
used
to
look
sometimes
as
he
had
looked
of
old
when
george
flack
located
them
somewhere
as
if
he
expected
to
see
their
heated
benefactor
rush
back
to
them
with
his
drab
overcoat
flying
in
the
wind
but
this
appearance
usually
and
rather
touchingly
subsided
he
at
any
rate
missed
gaston
because
gaston
had
this
winter
so
often
ordered
his
dinner
for
him
and
his
society
was
not
to
make
it
up
sought
by
the
count
and
the
marquis
whose
mastery
of
english
was
small
and
their
other
distractions
great
probert
it
was
true
had
shown
something
of
a
conversible
spirit
he
had
come
twice
to
the
hotel
since
his
son
s
departure
and
had
said
smiling
and
reproachful
you
neglect
us
you
neglect
us
my
dear
sir
the
good
man
had
not
understood
what
was
meant
by
this
till
delia
explained
after
the
visitor
had
withdrawn
and
even
then
the
remedy
for
the
neglect
administered
two
or
three
days
later
had
not
borne
any
copious
fruit
dosson
called
alone
instructed
by
his
daughter
in
the
cours
la
reine
but
probert
was
not
at
home
he
only
left
a
card
on
which
delia
had
superscribed
in
advance
almost
with
the
legibility
of
print
the
words
so
sorry
her
father
had
told
her
he
would
give
in
the
card
if
she
wanted
but
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
writing
there
was
a
discussion
as
to
whether
probert
s
remark
was
an
allusion
to
a
deficiency
of
politeness
on
the
article
of
his
oughtn
t
dosson
perhaps
to
call
personally
and
not
simply
through
the
medium
of
the
visits
paid
by
his
daughters
to
their
wives
on
messieurs
de
brecourt
and
de
cliche
once
when
this
subject
came
up
in
george
flack
s
presence
the
old
man
said
he
would
go
round
if
flack
would
accompany
him
all
right
we
ll
go
right
along
flack
had
responded
and
this
inspiration
had
become
a
living
fact
qualified
only
by
the
mercy
to
delia
dosson
that
the
other
two
gentlemen
were
not
at
home
suppose
they
should
get
in
she
had
said
lugubriously
to
her
sister
well
what
if
they
do
francie
had
asked
why
the
count
and
the
marquis
won
t
be
interested
in
well
then
perhaps
he
ll
be
interested
in
them
he
can
write
something
about
them
they
ll
like
do
you
think
they
would
delia
had
solemnly
weighed
it
why
yes
if
he
should
say
fine
they
do
like
fine
things
delia
had
conceded
they
get
off
so
many
themselves
only
the
way
flack
does
it
s
a
different
well
people
like
to
be
praised
in
any
that
s
so
delia
had
continued
to
brood
one
afternoon
coming
in
about
three
o
clock
flack
found
francie
alone
she
had
expressed
a
wish
after
luncheon
for
a
couple
of
hours
of
independence
intending
to
write
to
gaston
and
having
accidentally
missed
a
post
she
had
determined
her
letter
should
be
of
double
its
usual
length
her
companions
had
respected
her
claim
for
solitude
dosson
taking
himself
off
to
his
daily
session
in
the
of
the
american
bank
and
delia
the
girls
had
now
at
their
command
a
landau
as
massive
as
the
coach
of
an
ambassador
driving
away
to
the
dressmaker
s
a
frequent
errand
to
superintend
and
urge
forward
the
progress
of
her
sister
s
francie
was
not
skilled
in
composition
she
wrote
slowly
and
had
in
thus
addressing
her
lover
much
the
same
sense
of
sore
tension
she
supposed
she
should
have
in
standing
at
the
altar
with
him
her
father
and
delia
had
a
theory
that
when
she
shut
herself
up
that
way
she
poured
forth
pages
that
would
testify
to
her
costly
culture
when
george
flack
was
ushered
in
at
all
events
she
was
still
bent
over
her
at
one
of
the
gilded
tables
and
there
was
an
inkstain
on
her
pointed
forefinger
it
was
no
disloyalty
to
gaston
but
only
at
the
most
an
echo
as
of
the
sweetness
of
recess
time
in
old
school
mornings
that
made
her
glad
to
see
her
visitor
she
hadn
t
quite
known
how
to
finish
her
letter
in
the
infinite
of
the
bright
propriety
of
her
having
written
it
but
flack
seemed
to
set
a
practical
human
limit
i
wouldn
t
have
ventured
he
observed
on
entering
to
propose
this
but
i
guess
i
can
do
with
it
now
it
s
what
can
you
do
with
she
asked
wiping
her
pen
well
this
happy
chance
just
you
and
me
i
don
t
know
what
it
s
a
chance
well
for
me
to
be
a
little
less
miserable
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
makes
me
so
to
see
you
look
so
it
makes
you
miserable
francie
took
it
gaily
but
guardedly
you
ought
to
understand
when
i
say
something
so
and
settling
himself
on
the
sofa
flack
continued
well
how
do
you
get
on
without
probert
very
well
indeed
thank
the
tone
in
which
the
girl
spoke
was
not
an
encouragement
to
free
pleasantry
so
that
if
he
continued
his
enquiries
it
was
with
as
much
circumspection
as
he
had
perhaps
ever
in
his
life
recognised
himself
as
having
to
apply
to
a
given
occasion
he
was
eminently
capable
of
the
sense
that
it
wasn
t
in
his
interest
to
strike
her
as
indiscreet
and
profane
he
only
wanted
still
to
appear
a
real
reliable
gentleman
at
the
same
time
he
was
not
indifferent
to
the
profit
for
him
of
her
noticing
in
him
a
sense
as
of
a
good
fellow
once
badly
sold
which
would
always
give
him
a
certain
pull
on
what
he
called
to
himself
her
lovely
character
well
you
re
in
the
real
grand
old
monde
now
i
suppose
he
resumed
at
last
not
with
an
air
of
undue
derision
rather
with
a
kind
of
contemporary
but
detached
wistfulness
oh
i
m
not
in
anything
i
m
just
where
i
ve
always
i
m
sorry
i
hoped
you
d
tell
me
a
good
lot
about
it
said
flack
not
with
levity
you
think
too
much
of
that
what
do
you
want
to
know
so
much
about
it
for
well
he
took
some
trouble
for
his
reason
dear
miss
francie
a
poor
devil
of
a
journalist
who
has
to
get
his
living
by
things
has
to
think
too
much
sometimes
in
order
to
think
or
at
any
rate
to
do
enough
we
find
out
what
we
can
as
we
can
you
she
did
seem
to
catch
in
it
the
note
of
pathos
what
do
you
want
to
everything
i
take
in
everything
it
all
depends
on
my
opportunity
i
try
and
learn
i
try
and
improve
every
one
has
something
to
tell
or
to
sell
and
i
listen
and
watch
well
for
what
i
can
drink
in
or
can
buy
i
hoped
you
d
have
something
to
tell
for
i
m
not
talking
now
of
anything
but
that
i
don
t
believe
but
what
you
ve
seen
a
good
deal
of
new
life
you
won
t
pretend
they
ain
t
working
you
right
in
charming
as
you
do
you
mean
if
they
ve
been
kind
and
sweet
to
me
they
ve
been
very
kind
and
sweet
francie
mid
they
want
to
do
even
more
than
i
ll
let
ah
why
won
t
you
let
them
george
flack
asked
almost
coaxingly
well
i
do
when
it
comes
to
anything
the
girl
went
on
you
can
t
resist
them
really
they
ve
got
such
lovely
i
should
like
to
hear
you
talk
right
out
about
their
ways
her
companion
observed
after
a
silence
oh
i
could
talk
out
right
enough
if
once
i
were
to
begin
but
i
don
t
see
why
it
should
interest
don
t
i
care
immensely
for
everything
that
concerns
you
didn
t
i
tell
you
that
once
he
put
it
very
straight
well
you
were
foolish
ever
and
you
d
be
foolish
to
say
it
again
francie
replied
oh
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
i
ve
had
my
lesson
but
i
could
listen
to
you
all
francie
gave
an
exclamation
of
impatience
and
incredulity
and
flack
pursued
don
t
you
remember
what
you
told
me
that
time
we
had
that
talk
at
on
the
terrace
you
said
i
might
remain
your
well
that
s
all
right
said
the
girl
then
ain
t
we
interested
in
the
development
of
our
friends
in
their
impressions
their
situations
and
adventures
especially
a
person
like
me
who
has
got
to
know
life
whether
he
wants
to
or
no
who
has
got
to
know
the
do
you
mean
to
say
i
could
teach
you
about
life
francie
beautifully
gaped
about
some
kinds
certainly
you
know
a
lot
of
people
it
s
difficult
to
get
at
unless
one
takes
some
extraordinary
measures
as
you
ve
what
do
you
mean
what
measures
have
i
done
well
they
have
to
get
right
hold
of
you
and
its
the
same
thing
pouncing
on
you
to
secure
you
first
i
call
that
energetic
and
don
t
you
think
i
ought
to
know
smiled
flack
with
much
meaning
i
thought
was
energetic
but
they
got
in
ahead
of
me
they
re
a
society
apart
and
they
must
be
very
yes
they
re
very
curious
francie
admitted
with
a
resigned
sigh
then
she
said
do
you
want
to
put
them
in
the
paper
george
flack
cast
about
the
air
of
the
question
was
so
candid
suggested
so
complete
an
exemption
from
prejudice
oh
i
m
very
careful
about
what
i
put
in
the
paper
i
want
everything
as
i
told
you
don
t
you
remember
the
sketch
i
gave
you
of
my
ideals
but
i
want
it
in
the
right
way
and
of
the
right
brand
if
i
can
t
get
it
in
the
shape
i
like
it
i
don
t
want
it
at
all
information
straight
from
the
tap
is
what
i
m
after
i
don
t
want
to
hear
what
some
one
or
other
thinks
that
some
one
or
other
was
told
that
some
one
or
other
believed
or
said
and
above
all
i
don
t
want
to
print
it
there
s
plenty
of
that
flowing
in
and
the
best
part
of
the
job
s
to
keep
it
out
people
just
yearn
to
come
in
they
make
love
to
me
for
it
all
over
the
place
there
s
the
biggest
crowd
at
the
door
but
i
say
to
them
you
ve
got
to
do
something
first
then
i
ll
see
or
at
any
rate
you
ve
got
to
be
something
we
sometimes
see
the
reverberator
you
ve
some
fine
pieces
francie
humanely
replied
sometimes
only
don
t
they
send
it
to
the
old
gentleman
the
weekly
edition
i
thought
i
had
fixed
that
said
george
flack
i
don
t
know
it
s
usually
lying
round
but
delia
reads
it
more
than
i
she
reads
pieces
aloud
i
like
to
read
books
i
read
as
many
as
i
well
it
s
all
literature
said
flack
it
s
all
the
press
the
great
institution
of
our
time
some
of
the
finest
books
have
come
out
first
in
the
papers
it
s
the
history
of
the
i
see
you
ve
got
the
same
aspirations
francie
remarked
kindly
the
same
aspirations
those
you
told
me
about
that
day
at
oh
i
keep
forgetting
that
i
ever
broke
out
to
you
that
way
everything
s
so
are
you
the
proprietor
of
the
paper
now
the
girl
went
on
determined
not
to
catch
this
sentimental
echo
what
do
you
care
it
wouldn
t
even
be
delicate
in
me
to
tell
you
for
i
do
remember
the
way
you
said
you
d
try
and
get
your
father
to
help
me
don
t
say
you
ve
forgotten
it
because
you
almost
made
me
cry
anyway
that
isn
t
the
sort
of
help
i
want
now
and
it
wasn
t
the
sort
of
help
i
meant
to
ask
you
for
then
i
want
sympathy
and
interest
i
want
some
one
to
say
to
me
once
in
a
while
keep
up
your
old
heart
flack
you
ll
come
out
all
you
see
i
m
a
and
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
anything
else
francie
s
companion
went
on
i
don
t
live
on
the
accumulations
of
my
ancestors
what
i
have
i
earn
what
i
am
i
ve
fought
for
i
m
a
real
old
travailleur
as
they
say
here
i
rejoice
in
it
but
there
s
one
dark
spot
in
it
all
the
and
what
s
that
francie
decided
not
quite
at
once
to
ask
that
it
makes
you
ashamed
of
oh
how
can
you
say
and
she
got
up
as
if
a
sense
of
oppression
of
vague
discomfort
had
come
over
her
her
visitor
troubled
such
peace
as
she
had
lately
arrived
at
you
wouldn
t
be
ashamed
to
go
round
with
me
round
where
well
anywhere
just
to
have
one
more
walk
the
very
george
flack
had
got
up
too
and
stood
there
looking
at
her
with
his
bright
eyes
his
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
overcoat
as
she
hesitated
he
continued
then
i
m
not
such
a
friend
after
she
rested
her
eyes
a
moment
on
the
carpet
then
raising
them
where
would
you
like
to
go
you
could
render
me
a
service
a
real
service
without
any
inconvenience
probably
to
yourself
isn
t
your
portrait
finished
yes
but
he
won
t
give
it
who
won
t
give
it
up
why
waterlow
he
wants
to
keep
it
near
him
to
look
at
it
in
case
he
should
take
a
fancy
to
change
it
but
i
hope
he
won
t
change
it
it
s
so
lovely
as
it
is
francie
made
a
mild
joke
of
saying
i
hear
it
s
magnificent
and
i
want
to
see
it
said
george
flack
then
why
don
t
you
go
i
ll
go
if
you
ll
take
me
that
s
the
service
you
can
render
why
i
thought
you
went
everywhere
into
the
palaces
of
kings
francie
cried
i
go
where
i
m
welcome
not
where
i
ain
t
i
don
t
want
to
push
into
that
studio
alone
he
doesn
t
want
me
round
oh
you
needn
t
protest
the
young
man
went
on
if
a
fellow
s
made
sensitive
he
has
got
to
stay
so
i
feel
those
things
in
the
shade
of
a
tone
of
voice
he
doesn
t
like
some
people
don
t
you
know
i
ought
to
tell
you
that
francie
considered
again
but
looking
this
time
at
her
visitor
why
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
you
i
m
afraid
she
said
hadn
t
have
been
i
d
never
have
sat
to
flack
smiled
at
her
in
silence
for
a
little
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
me
i
think
you
d
never
have
met
your
future
perhaps
not
said
francie
and
suddenly
she
blushed
red
rather
to
her
companion
s
surprise
i
only
say
that
to
remind
you
that
after
all
i
ve
a
right
to
ask
you
to
show
me
this
one
little
favour
let
me
drive
with
you
or
next
day
or
any
day
to
the
avenue
de
villiers
and
i
shall
regard
myself
as
amply
repaid
with
you
i
shan
t
be
afraid
to
go
in
for
you
ve
a
right
to
take
any
one
you
like
to
see
your
picture
that
s
the
rule
oh
the
day
you
re
afraid
flack
francie
laughed
without
fear
she
had
been
much
struck
by
his
reminder
of
what
they
all
owed
him
for
he
truly
had
been
their
initiator
the
instrument
under
providence
that
had
opened
a
great
new
interest
to
them
and
as
she
was
more
listless
about
almost
anything
than
at
the
sight
of
a
person
wronged
she
winced
at
his
describing
himself
as
disavowed
or
made
light
of
after
the
prize
was
gained
her
mind
had
not
lingered
on
her
personal
indebtedness
to
him
for
it
was
not
in
the
nature
of
her
mind
to
linger
but
at
present
she
was
glad
to
spring
quickly
at
the
first
word
into
the
attitude
of
acknowledgement
it
had
the
effect
of
simplification
after
too
multiplied
an
appeal
it
brought
up
her
spirits
of
course
i
must
be
quite
square
with
you
the
young
man
said
in
a
tone
that
struck
her
as
higher
somehow
than
any
she
had
ever
heard
him
use
if
i
want
to
see
the
picture
it
s
because
i
want
to
write
about
it
the
whole
thing
will
go
bang
into
the
reverberator
you
must
understand
that
in
advance
i
wouldn
t
write
about
it
without
seeing
it
we
don
t
do
that
and
flack
appeared
to
speak
proudly
again
for
his
organ
j
espere
bien
said
francie
who
was
getting
on
famously
with
her
french
of
course
if
you
praise
him
waterlow
will
like
i
don
t
know
that
he
cares
for
my
praise
and
i
don
t
care
much
whether
he
likes
it
or
not
for
you
to
like
it
s
the
principal
thing
we
must
do
with
oh
i
shall
be
awfully
i
shall
speak
of
you
personally
i
shall
say
you
re
the
prettiest
girl
that
has
ever
come
you
may
say
what
you
like
francie
returned
it
will
be
immense
fun
to
be
in
the
newspapers
come
for
me
at
this
hour
day
after
you
re
too
kind
said
george
flack
taking
up
his
hat
he
smoothed
it
down
a
moment
with
his
glove
then
he
said
i
wonder
if
you
ll
mind
our
going
alone
alone
i
mean
just
you
and
oh
don
t
you
be
afraid
father
and
delia
have
seen
it
about
thirty
that
ll
be
and
it
will
help
me
to
feel
more
than
anything
else
could
make
me
do
that
we
re
still
old
friends
i
couldn
t
bear
the
end
of
that
i
ll
come
at
flack
went
on
but
without
even
yet
taking
his
departure
he
asked
two
or
three
questions
about
the
hotel
whether
it
were
as
good
as
last
year
and
there
were
many
people
in
it
and
they
could
keep
their
rooms
warm
then
pursued
suddenly
on
a
different
plane
and
scarcely
waiting
for
the
girl
s
answer
and
now
for
instance
are
they
very
bigoted
that
s
one
of
the
things
i
should
like
to
very
bigoted
ain
t
they
tremendous
catholics
always
talking
about
the
holy
father
what
they
call
here
the
throne
and
the
altar
and
don
t
they
want
the
throne
too
i
mean
probert
the
old
gentleman
flack
added
and
those
grand
ladies
and
all
the
rest
of
they
re
very
religious
said
francie
they
re
the
most
religious
people
i
ever
saw
they
just
adore
the
holy
father
they
know
him
personally
quite
well
they
re
always
going
down
to
and
do
they
mean
to
introduce
you
to
him
how
do
you
mean
to
introduce
me
why
to
make
you
a
catholic
to
take
you
also
down
to
oh
we
re
going
to
rome
for
our
voyage
de
noces
said
francie
gaily
just
for
a
and
won
t
you
have
to
have
a
catholic
marriage
if
they
won
t
consent
to
a
protestant
we
re
going
to
have
a
lovely
one
just
like
one
that
mme
de
brecourt
took
me
to
see
at
the
and
will
it
be
at
the
madeleine
too
yes
unless
we
have
it
at
notre
and
how
will
your
father
and
sister
like
that
our
having
it
at
notre
dame
yes
or
at
the
madeleine
your
not
having
it
at
the
american
oh
delia
wants
it
at
the
best
place
said
francie
simply
then
she
added
and
you
know
poppa
ain
t
much
on
well
now
that
s
what
i
call
a
genuine
fact
the
sort
i
was
talking
about
flack
replied
whereupon
he
at
last
took
himself
off
repeating
that
he
would
come
in
two
days
later
at
sharp
francie
gave
an
account
of
his
visit
to
her
sister
on
the
return
of
the
latter
young
lady
and
mentioned
the
agreement
they
had
come
to
in
relation
to
the
drive
delia
brooded
on
it
a
while
like
a
sitting
hen
so
little
did
she
know
that
it
was
right
as
it
was
right
delia
usually
said
that
francie
should
be
so
intimate
with
other
gentlemen
after
she
was
engaged
intimate
you
wouldn
t
think
it
s
very
intimate
if
you
were
to
see
me
francie
cried
with
amusement
i
m
sure
i
don
t
want
to
see
you
delia
declared
the
sharpness
of
which
made
her
sister
suddenly
strenuous
delia
dosson
do
you
realise
that
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
flack
we
would
never
have
had
that
picture
and
that
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
that
picture
i
should
never
have
got
engaged
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
hadn
t
if
that
s
the
way
you
re
going
to
behave
nothing
would
induce
me
to
go
with
this
was
what
suited
francie
but
she
was
nevertheless
struck
by
delia
s
rigour
i
m
only
going
to
take
him
to
see
has
he
become
all
of
a
sudden
too
shy
to
go
alone
well
you
know
waterlow
has
a
prejudice
against
him
and
has
made
him
feel
it
you
know
gaston
told
us
he
told
us
he
couldn
t
bear
him
that
s
what
he
told
us
said
delia
all
the
more
reason
i
should
be
kind
to
him
why
delia
do
realise
francie
went
on
that
s
just
what
i
do
returned
the
elder
girl
but
things
that
are
very
different
from
those
you
want
me
to
you
have
queer
i
ve
others
too
that
you
may
like
better
he
wants
to
put
a
piece
in
the
paper
about
about
your
picture
yes
and
about
me
all
about
the
whole
delia
stared
a
moment
well
i
hope
it
will
be
a
good
one
she
said
with
a
groan
of
oppression
as
from
the
crushing
majesty
of
their
fate
x
when
francie
two
days
later
passed
with
flack
into
charles
waterlow
s
studio
she
found
mme
de
cliche
before
the
great
canvas
she
enjoyed
every
positive
sign
that
the
proberts
took
an
interest
in
her
and
this
was
a
considerable
symptom
gaston
s
second
sister
s
coming
all
that
way
she
lived
over
by
the
invalides
to
look
at
the
portrait
once
more
francie
knew
she
had
seen
it
at
an
earlier
stage
the
work
had
excited
curiosity
and
discussion
among
the
proberts
from
the
first
of
their
making
her
acquaintance
when
they
went
into
considerations
about
it
which
had
not
occurred
to
the
original
and
her
companions
frequently
as
to
our
knowledge
these
good
people
had
conversed
on
the
subject
gaston
had
told
her
that
opinions
differed
much
in
the
family
as
to
the
merit
of
the
work
and
that
margaret
precisely
had
gone
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
might
be
a
masterpiece
of
tone
but
didn
t
make
her
look
like
a
lady
his
father
on
the
other
hand
had
no
objection
to
offer
to
the
character
in
which
it
represented
her
but
he
didn
t
think
it
well
painted
ca
et
ca
et
ca
je
vous
demande
he
had
exclaimed
making
little
dashes
at
the
canvas
with
his
glove
toward
mystifying
spots
on
occasions
when
the
artist
was
not
at
hand
the
proberts
always
fell
into
french
when
they
spoke
on
a
question
of
art
poor
dear
papa
he
only
understands
le
vieux
jeu
gaston
had
explained
and
he
had
still
further
to
expound
what
he
meant
by
the
old
game
the
of
charles
waterlow
s
game
had
already
been
a
bewilderment
to
probert
francie
remembered
now
she
had
forgotten
it
margaret
de
cliche
s
having
told
her
she
meant
to
come
again
she
hoped
the
marquise
thought
by
this
time
that
on
canvas
at
least
she
looked
a
little
more
like
a
lady
mme
de
cliche
smiled
at
her
at
any
rate
and
kissed
her
as
if
in
fact
there
could
be
no
mistake
she
smiled
also
at
flack
on
francie
s
introducing
him
and
only
looked
grave
when
after
she
had
asked
where
the
others
were
the
papa
and
the
grande
soeur
the
girl
replied
that
she
hadn
t
the
least
idea
her
party
consisted
only
of
herself
and
flack
then
mme
de
cliche
s
grace
stiffened
taking
on
a
shade
that
brought
back
francie
s
sense
that
she
was
the
individual
among
all
gaston
s
belongings
who
had
pleased
her
least
from
the
first
mme
de
douves
was
superficially
more
formidable
but
with
her
the
second
impression
was
comparatively
comforting
it
was
just
this
second
impression
of
the
marquise
that
was
not
there
were
perhaps
others
behind
it
but
the
girl
hadn
t
yet
arrived
at
them
waterlow
mightn
t
have
been
very
much
prepossessed
with
flack
but
he
was
none
the
less
perfectly
civil
to
him
and
took
much
trouble
to
show
him
the
work
he
had
in
hand
dragging
out
canvases
changing
lights
moving
him
off
to
see
things
at
the
other
end
of
the
great
room
while
the
two
gentlemen
were
at
a
distance
mme
de
cliche
expressed
to
francie
the
conviction
that
she
would
allow
her
to
see
her
home
on
which
francie
replied
that
she
was
not
going
home
but
was
going
somewhere
else
with
flack
and
she
explained
as
if
it
simplified
the
matter
that
this
gentleman
was
a
big
editor
her
that
was
to
be
echoed
the
term
and
francie
developed
her
explanation
he
was
not
the
only
big
editor
but
one
of
the
many
big
editors
of
an
enormous
american
paper
he
was
going
to
publish
an
article
as
big
as
enormous
as
all
the
rest
of
the
business
about
her
portrait
gaston
knew
him
perfectly
it
was
flack
who
had
been
the
cause
of
gaston
s
being
presented
to
her
mme
de
cliche
looked
across
at
him
as
if
the
inadequacy
of
the
cause
projected
an
unfavourable
light
upon
an
effect
hitherto
perhaps
not
exactly
measured
she
appealed
as
to
whether
francie
thought
gaston
would
like
her
to
drive
about
paris
alone
with
one
of
ces
messieurs
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
i
never
asked
him
said
francie
he
ought
to
want
me
to
be
polite
to
a
person
who
did
so
much
for
soon
after
this
mme
de
cliche
retired
with
no
fresh
sign
of
any
sense
of
the
existence
of
flack
though
he
stood
in
her
path
as
she
approached
the
door
she
didn
t
kiss
our
young
lady
again
and
the
girl
observed
that
her
consisted
of
the
simple
words
adieu
she
had
already
noted
that
in
proportion
as
the
proberts
became
majestic
they
became
articulately
french
she
and
flack
remained
in
the
studio
but
a
short
time
longer
and
when
they
were
seated
in
the
carriage
again
at
the
door
they
had
come
in
dosson
s
open
landau
her
companion
said
and
now
where
shall
we
go
he
spoke
as
if
on
their
way
from
the
hotel
he
hadn
t
touched
upon
the
pleasant
vision
of
a
little
turn
in
the
bois
he
had
insisted
then
that
the
day
was
made
on
purpose
the
air
full
of
spring
at
present
he
seemed
to
wish
to
give
himself
the
pleasure
of
making
his
companion
choose
that
particular
alternative
but
she
only
answered
rather
impatiently
wherever
you
like
wherever
you
like
and
she
sat
there
swaying
her
parasol
looking
about
her
giving
no
order
au
bois
said
george
flack
to
the
coachman
leaning
back
on
the
soft
cushions
for
a
few
moments
after
the
carriage
had
taken
its
easy
elastic
start
they
were
silent
but
he
soon
began
again
was
that
lady
one
of
your
new
relatives
do
you
mean
one
of
probert
s
old
ones
she
s
his
is
there
any
particular
reason
in
that
why
she
shouldn
t
say
to
me
she
didn
t
want
you
to
remain
with
me
she
doesn
t
like
you
to
go
round
with
me
she
wanted
to
carry
me
what
has
she
got
against
me
flack
asked
with
a
kind
of
portentous
calm
francie
seemed
to
consider
a
little
oh
it
s
these
funny
french
funny
some
of
them
are
very
base
said
george
flack
his
companion
made
no
answer
she
only
turned
her
eyes
to
right
and
left
admiring
the
splendid
day
and
shining
city
the
great
architectural
vista
was
fair
the
tall
houses
with
their
polished
their
balconies
their
signs
with
accented
letters
seemed
to
make
a
glitter
of
gilt
and
crystal
as
they
rose
in
the
sunny
air
the
colour
of
everything
was
cool
and
pretty
and
the
sound
of
everything
gay
the
sense
of
a
costly
spectacle
was
everywhere
well
i
like
paris
anyway
francie
exhaled
at
last
with
her
little
harmonising
flatness
it
s
lucky
for
you
since
you
ve
got
to
live
i
haven
t
got
to
there
s
no
obligation
we
haven
t
settled
anything
about
hasn
t
that
lady
settled
it
for
you
yes
very
likely
she
has
said
francie
placidly
enough
i
don
t
like
her
so
well
as
the
you
like
the
others
very
much
of
course
i
do
so
would
you
if
they
had
made
so
much
of
that
one
at
the
studio
didn
t
make
much
of
me
certainly
flack
declared
yes
she
s
the
most
haughty
francie
allowed
well
what
is
it
all
about
her
friend
demanded
who
are
they
anyway
oh
it
would
take
me
three
hours
to
tell
you
the
girl
cheerfully
sighed
they
go
back
a
thousand
well
we
ve
got
a
thousand
years
i
mean
three
and
george
flack
settled
himself
more
on
his
cushions
and
inhaled
the
pleasant
air
i
am
getting
something
out
of
this
drive
miss
francie
he
went
on
it
s
many
a
day
since
i
ve
been
to
the
old
bois
i
don
t
fool
round
much
in
francie
replied
candidly
that
for
her
too
the
occasion
was
most
agreeable
and
flack
pursued
looking
round
him
with
his
hard
smile
irrelevantly
but
sociably
yes
these
french
ideas
i
don
t
see
how
you
can
stand
them
those
they
have
about
young
ladies
are
well
they
tell
me
you
like
them
better
after
you
re
why
after
they
re
married
they
re
worse
i
mean
the
ideas
every
one
knows
well
they
can
make
you
like
anything
the
way
they
talk
francie
said
and
do
they
talk
a
great
deal
well
i
should
think
so
they
don
t
do
much
else
and
all
about
the
queerest
things
things
i
never
heard
ah
that
i
ll
bet
my
life
on
flack
returned
with
understanding
of
course
his
companion
obligingly
proceeded
ve
had
most
conversation
with
the
old
gentleman
no
very
little
with
him
i
mean
with
gaston
but
it
s
not
he
that
has
told
me
most
it
s
mme
de
brecourt
she
s
great
on
life
on
their
life
it
s
very
interesting
she
has
told
me
all
their
histories
all
their
troubles
and
complications
flack
threw
off
that
s
what
she
calls
them
it
seems
very
different
from
america
it
s
just
like
a
beautiful
story
they
have
such
strange
feelings
but
there
are
things
you
can
see
without
being
what
sort
of
things
well
like
mme
de
cliche
s
but
francie
paused
as
if
for
a
word
her
friend
was
prompt
with
assistance
do
you
mean
her
complications
yes
and
her
husband
s
she
has
terrible
ones
that
s
why
one
must
forgive
her
if
she
s
rather
peculiar
she
s
very
do
you
mean
through
her
husband
yes
he
likes
other
ladies
better
he
flirts
with
mme
de
flack
s
hand
closed
over
it
mme
de
brives
yes
she
s
lovely
said
francie
she
ain
t
very
young
but
she
s
fearfully
attractive
and
he
used
to
go
every
day
to
have
tea
with
mme
de
villepreux
mme
de
cliche
can
t
bear
mme
de
well
he
seems
a
kind
of
mean
man
george
flack
moralised
oh
his
mother
was
very
bad
that
was
one
thing
they
had
against
the
who
had
against
what
marriage
when
maggie
probert
became
is
that
what
they
call
her
maggie
her
brother
does
but
every
one
else
calls
her
margot
old
mme
de
cliche
had
a
horrid
reputation
every
one
hated
except
those
i
suppose
who
liked
her
too
much
flack
permitted
himself
to
guess
and
who
s
mme
de
villepreux
he
proceeded
she
s
the
daughter
of
mme
de
and
who
s
that
old
sinner
the
young
man
asked
oh
i
guess
she
s
dead
said
francie
she
used
to
be
a
great
friend
of
probert
of
gaston
s
he
used
to
go
to
tea
with
her
almost
every
day
susan
says
he
has
never
been
the
same
since
her
the
way
they
do
come
out
with
em
flack
chuckled
and
who
the
mischief
s
susan
why
mme
de
brecourt
probert
just
loved
mme
de
marignac
mme
de
villepreux
isn
t
so
nice
as
her
mother
she
was
brought
up
with
the
proberts
like
a
sister
and
now
she
carries
on
with
with
maxime

oh
i

and
george
flack
engulfed
it
they
had
reached
the
top
of
the
champs
elysees
and
were
passing
below
the
wondrous
arch
to
which
that
gentle
eminence
forms
a
pedestal
and
which
looks
down
even
on
splendid
paris
from
its
immensity
and
across
at
the
vain
mask
of
the
tuileries
and
the
louvre
and
the
twin
towers
of
notre
dame
painted
blue
by
the
distance
the
confluence
of
carriages
a
sounding
stream
in
which
our
friends
became
engaged
rolled
into
the
large
avenue
leading
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
flack
evidently
enjoyed
the
scene
he
gazed
about
him
at
their
neighbours
at
the
villas
and
gardens
on
either
hand
he
took
in
the
prospect
of
the
brown
boskages
and
smooth
alleys
of
the
wood
of
the
hour
they
had
yet
to
spend
there
of
the
rest
of
francie
s
pleasant
prattle
of
the
place
near
the
lake
where
they
could
alight
and
walk
a
little
even
of
the
bench
where
they
might
sit
down
i
see
i
see
he
repeated
with
appreciation
you
make
me
feel
quite
as
if
i
were
in
the
grand
old
xi
one
day
at
noon
shortly
before
the
time
for
which
gaston
had
announced
his
return
a
note
was
brought
francie
from
mme
de
brecourt
it
caused
her
some
agitation
though
it
contained
a
clause
intended
to
guard
her
against
vain
fears
please
come
to
me
the
moment
you
ve
received
this
i
ve
sent
the
carriage
i
ll
explain
when
you
get
here
what
i
want
to
see
you
about
nothing
has
happened
to
gaston
we
are
all
the
coupe
from
the
place
beauvau
was
waiting
at
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
the
girl
had
but
a
hurried
conference
with
her
father
and
sister
if
conference
it
could
be
called
in
which
vagueness
on
the
one
side
melted
into
blankness
on
the
other
it
s
for
something
bad
something
bad
francie
none
the
less
said
while
she
tied
her
bonnet
though
she
was
unable
to
think
what
it
could
be
delia
who
looked
a
good
deal
scared
offered
to
accompany
her
on
which
dosson
made
the
first
remark
of
a
practical
character
in
which
he
had
indulged
in
relation
to
his
daughter
s
alliance
no
you
won
t
no
you
won
t
my
dear
they
may
whistle
for
francie
but
let
them
see
that
they
can
t
whistle
for
all
of
it
was
the
first
sign
he
had
given
of
being
jealous
of
the
dignity
of
the
dossons
that
question
had
never
troubled
him
i
know
what
it
is
said
delia
while
she
arranged
her
sister
s
garments
they
want
to
talk
about
religion
they
ve
got
the
priests
there
s
some
bishop
or
perhaps
some
cardinal
they
want
to
baptise
then
you
d
better
take
a
waterproof
francie
s
father
called
after
her
as
she
flitted
away
she
wondered
rolling
toward
the
place
beauvau
what
they
were
all
there
for
that
announcement
balanced
against
the
reassurance
conveyed
in
the
phrase
about
gaston
she
liked
them
individually
but
in
their
collective
form
they
made
her
uneasy
in
their
family
parties
there
was
always
something
of
the
tribunal
mme
de
brecourt
came
out
to
meet
her
in
the
vestibule
drawing
her
quickly
into
a
small
room
not
the
salon
francie
knew
it
as
her
hostess
s
own
room
a
lovely
boudoir
in
which
considerably
to
the
girl
s
relief
the
rest
of
the
family
were
not
assembled
yet
she
guessed
in
a
moment
that
they
were
near
at
hand
they
were
waiting
susan
looked
flushed
and
strange
she
had
a
queer
smile
she
kissed
her
as
if
she
didn
t
know
she
was
doing
it
she
laughed
as
she
greeted
her
but
her
laugh
was
extravagant
it
was
a
different
demonstration
every
way
from
any
francie
had
hitherto
had
to
reckon
with
by
the
time
our
young
lady
had
noted
these
things
she
was
sitting
beside
her
on
a
sofa
and
mme
de
brecourt
had
her
hand
which
she
held
so
tight
that
it
almost
hurt
her
susan
s
eyes
were
in
their
nature
salient
but
on
this
occasion
they
seemed
to
have
started
out
of
her
head
we
re
upside
down
terribly
agitated
a
thunderbolt
has
fallen
on
the
what
s
the
matter
what
s
the
matter
francie
asked
pale
and
with
parted
lips
she
had
a
sudden
wild
idea
that
gaston
might
have
found
out
in
america
that
her
father
had
no
money
had
lost
it
all
that
it
had
been
stolen
during
their
long
absence
but
would
he
cast
her
off
for
that
you
must
understand
the
closeness
of
our
union
with
you
from
our
sending
for
you
this
way
the
first
the
only
person
in
a
crisis
our
joys
are
your
joys
and
our
indignations
are
what
is
the
matter
please
the
girl
repeated
their
indignations
opened
up
a
gulf
it
flashed
upon
her
with
a
shock
of
mortification
for
the
belated
idea
that
something
would
have
come
out
a
piece
in
the
paper
from
flack
about
her
portrait
and
even
a
little
about
herself
but
that
was
only
more
mystifying
for
certainly
flack
could
only
have
published
something
pleasant
something
to
be
proud
of
had
he
by
some
incredible
perversity
or
treachery
stated
that
the
picture
was
bad
or
even
that
she
was
she
grew
dizzy
remembering
how
she
had
refused
him
and
how
little
he
had
liked
it
that
day
at
but
they
had
made
that
up
over
and
over
especially
when
they
sat
so
long
on
a
bench
together
the
time
they
drove
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
oh
the
most
awful
thing
a
newspaper
sent
this
morning
from
america
to
my
father
containing
two
horrible
columns
of
vulgar
lies
and
scandal
about
our
family
about
all
of
us
about
you
about
your
picture
about
poor
marguerite
calling
her
margot
about
maxime
and
leonie
de
villepreux
saying
he
s
her
lover
about
all
our
affairs
about
gaston
about
your
marriage
about
your
sister
and
your
dresses
and
your
dimples
about
our
darling
father
whose
history
it
professes
to
relate
in
the
most
ignoble
the
most
revolting
terms
papa
s
in
the
most
awful
state
and
mme
de
brecourt
panted
to
take
breath
she
had
spoken
with
the
volubility
of
horror
and
passion
you
re
outraged
with
us
and
you
must
suffer
with
us
she
went
on
but
who
has
done
it
who
has
done
it
who
has
done
it
why
flack
flack
francie
quickly
replied
she
was
appalled
overwhelmed
but
her
foremost
feeling
was
the
wish

how

all
so
infamously
false
the
poor

poured
forth
her
woe
in
questions
contradictions
lamentations
she
didn

what
to

she
tried
to

studio
but
i
wouldn

let
her
he

an
old
friend
a
friend
of
poppa

and
i

much
what
my
father
allows
that
s
not
for
others
to
criticise
francie
continued
she
was
frightened
extremely
frightened
at
her
companion
s
air
of
tragedy
and
at
the
dreadful
consequences
she
alluded
to
consequences
of
an
act
she
herself
didn
t
know
couldn
t
comprehend
nor
measure
yet
but
there
was
an
instinct
of
bravery
in
her
which
threw
her
into
blind
defence
defence
even
of
george
flack
though
it
was
a
part
of
her
consternation
that
on
her
too
he
should
have
practised
a
surprise
it
would
appear
to
be
some
deception
oh
how
can
you
bear
with
such
brutes
how
can
your
father
what
devil
has
he
paid

and
such
a
language
mme
de
brecourt
came
nearer
took
both
her
hands
now
drew
her
closer
seemed
to
supplicate
her
for
some
disproof
some
antidote
to
the
nightmare
you
shall
see
the
paper
they

got
it
in
the
other

the
most
disgusting
sheet

white

looked
for
a
minute
at
the
carpet
and
what
does
it
say
about
me
some
trash
about
your
being
the
great
american
beauty
with
the
most
odious
details
and
your
having
made
a
match
among
the
rare
old
and
the
strangest
stuff
about
your
father
his
having
gone
into
a
store
at
the
age
of
twelve
and
something
about
your
poor
sister
heaven
help
us
and
a
sketch
of
our
career
in
paris
as
they
call
it
and
the
way
we
ve
pushed
and
got
on
and
our
ridiculous
pretensions
and
a
passage
about
blanche

sister
who
had
that
disease
what
do
they
call
it
that
she
used
to
steal

deny

up
to

she
has

that
idea
she

given
it
to
the

and
of

anguish
and
of
his
faith
of
what
he
would
expect
of
mme
de
brecourt
hurried
on
and
her
companion
s
bewilderment
deepened
to
see
how
the
tears
had
risen
to
her
eyes
and
were
pouring
down
her
cheeks
you
must
say
to
my
father
face
to

that
you

incapable
that
you
re
stainless
francie
bleated
it
like
a
bewildered
interrogative
lamb
but
the
had
to
be
faced
of
course
i
knew
he
wanted
to
write
a
piece
about
the
picture
and
about
my
about
your
marriage
of
course
you
knew
then
wretched
girl
you
re
at
the
bottom
of
all
cried
mme
de
brecourt
flinging
herself
away
falling
back
on
the
sofa
prostrate
there
and
covering
her
face
with
her
hands
he
told
me
he
told
me
when
i
went
with
him
to
the
studio
francie
asseverated
loud
but
he
seems
to
have
printed
more
i
should
think
so
and
mme
de
brecourt
rebounded
standing
before
her
and
you
let
him
about
yourself
you
gave
him
preposterous
facts
i
told
him
i
told
him
i
don
t
know
what
it
was
for
his
paper
he
wants
everything
it

a
very
fine
paper
said
the
girl
a
very
fine
paper
mme
de
brecourt
flushed
with
parted
lips
have
you
seen
have
you
touched
the
hideous
sheet
ah
my
brother
my
brother
she
quavered
again
turning
away
if
your
brother
were
here
you
wouldn
t
talk
to
me
this
way
he
d
protect
me
gaston
would
cried
francie
on
her
feet
seizing
her
little
muff
and
moving
to
the
door
go
away
go
away
or
they
ll
kill
you
her
friend
went
on
excitedly
after
all
i
ve
done
for
you
after
the
way
i
ve
lied
for
you
and
she
sobbed
trying
to
repress
her
sobs
francie
at
this
broke
out
into
a
torrent
of
tears
i
ll
go
home
poppa
poppa
she
almost
shrieked
reaching
the
door
oh
your
father
he
has
been
a
nice
father
bringing
you
up
in
such
ideas
these
words
followed
her
with
infinite
scorn
but
almost
as
mme
de
brecourt
uttered
them
struck
by
a
sound
she
sprang
after
the
girl
seized
her
drew
her
back
and
held
her
a
moment
listening
before
she
could
pass
out
hush
hush
they
re
coming
in
here
they
re
too
anxious
deny
deny
it
say
you
know
nothing
your
sister
must
have
said
things
and
such
things
say
it
all
comes
from
her
oh
you
dreadful
is
that
what
you
do
cried
francie
shaking
herself
free
the
door
opened
as
she
spoke
and
mme
de
brecourt
walked
quickly
to
the
window
turning
her
back
mme
de
cliche
was
there
and
probert
and
de
brecourt
and
de
cliche
they
entered
in
silence
and
de
brecourt
coming
last
closed
the
door
softly
behind
him
francie
had
never
been
in
a
court
of
justice
but
if
she
had
had
that
experience
these
four
persons
would
have
reminded
her
of
the
jury
filing
back
into
their
box
with
their
verdict
they
all
looked
at
her
hard
as
she
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
mme
de
brecourt
gazed
out
of
the
window
wiping
her
tears
mme
de
cliche
grasped
a
newspaper
crumpled
and
partly
folded
francie
got
a
quick
impression
moving
her
eyes
from
one
face
to
another
that
old
probert
was
the
worst
his
mild
ravaged
expression
was
terrible
he
was
the
one
who
looked
at
her
least
he
went
to
the
fireplace
and
leaned
on
the
mantel
with
his
head
in
his
hands
he
seemed
ten
years
older
ah
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
mademoiselle
said
maxime
de
cliche
slowly
impressively
in
a
tone
of
the
most
respectful
but
most
poignant
reproach
have
you
seen
it
have
they
sent
it
to
you
his
wife
asked
thrusting
the
paper
toward
her
it
s
quite
at
your
service
but
as
francie
neither
spoke
nor
took
it
she
tossed
it
upon
the
sofa
where
as
it
opened
falling
the
girl
read
the
name
of
the
reverberator
mme
de
cliche
carried
her
head
very
far
aloft
she
has
nothing
to
do
with
it
it
s
just
as
i
told
you
she
s
overwhelmed
said
mme
de
brecourt
remaining
at
the
window
you
d
do
well
to
read
it
it
s
worth
the
trouble
alphonse
de
brecourt
remarked
going
over
to
his
wife
francie
saw
him
kiss
her
as
he
noted
her
tears
she
was
angry
at
her
own
she
choked
and
swallowed
them
they
seemed
somehow
to
put
her
in
the
wrong
have
you
had
no
idea
that
any
such
monstrosity
would
be
perpetrated
mme
de
cliche
went
on
coming
nearer
to
her
she
had
a
manner
of
forced
calmness
as
if
she
wished
it
to
be
understood
that
she
was
one
of
those
who
could
be
reasonable
under
any
provocation
though
she
were
trembling
within
which
made
francie
draw
back
c
est
pourtant
rempli
de
choses
which
we
know
you
to
have
been
told
of
by
what
folly
great
heaven
it
s
right
and
left
no
one
s
spared
it
s
a
deluge
of
the
lowest
insult
my
sister
perhaps
will
have
told
you
of
the
apprehensions
i
had
i
couldn
t
resist
them
though
i
thought
of
nothing
so
awful
as
this
god

the
day
i
met
you
at

with
your
i

told

cried
mme
de
brecourt
all
distrustfully
and
still
at
the
window
ah
your
journalist
your
journalist
mademoiselle
said
maxime
de
cliche
i
m
very
sorry
to
have
to
say
anything
in
regard
to
any
friend
of
yours
that
can
give
you
so
little
pleasure
but
i
promise
myself
the
satisfaction
of
administering
him
with
these
hands
a
dressing
he
won
t
forget
if
i
may
trouble
you
so
far
as
to
ask
you
to
let
him
know
it
de
cliche
fingered
the
points
of
his
moustache
he
diffused
some
powerful
scent
his
eyes
were
dreadful
to
francie
she
wished
probert
would
say
something
kind
to
her
but
she
had
now
determined
to
be
strong
they
were
ever
so
many
against
one
gaston
was
far
away
and
she
felt
heroic
if
you
mean
flack
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
she
said
as
composedly
as
possible
to
de
cliche
mr
flack
has
gone
to
at
this
de
brecourt
gave
a
free
laugh
and
his
replied
ah
it
s
easy
to
go
to
they
like
such
things
there
they
do
them
more
and
more
it
s
as
bad
as
america
mme
de
cliche
declared
why
have
you
sent
for
me
what
do
you
all
want
me
to
do
you
might
explain
i
m
only
an
american
girl
said
francie
whose
being
only
an
american
girl
didn
t
prevent
her
pretty
head
from
holding
itself
now
as
high
as
mme
de
cliche
s
mme
de
brecourt
came
back
to
her
quickly
laying
her
hand
on
her
arm
you
re
very
nervous
you
d
much
better
go
home
i

explain
everything
to
them
i
ll
make

understand
the
carriage

had
orders
to
i

not
in
the

nervous
but
i
ve
made
you
all
so
francie
brought
out
with
the
highest
spirit
i
defend
you
my
dear
young
lady
i
insist
that
you
re
only
a
wretched
victim
like
ourselves
de
brecourt
remarked
approaching
her
with
a
smile
i
see
the
hand
of
a
woman
in
it
you
know
he
went
on
to
the
others
for
there
are
strokes
of
a
vulgarity
that
a
man
doesn
t
sink
to
he
can
t
his
very
organisation
prevents
him
even
if
he
be
the
dernier
des
goujats
but
please
don
t
doubt
that
i
ve
maintained
that
woman
not
to
be
the
way
you
talk
don
t
know
how
to
write
francie
impatiently
quavered
my
poor
child
when
one
knows
you
as
i
do
murmured
mme
de
brecourt
with
an
arm
round
her
there
s
a
lady
who
helps
him
flack
has
told
me
so
the
girl
continued
she
s
a
literary
lady
here
in
paris
she
writes
what
he
tells
her
i
think
her
name
s
miss
topping
but
she
calls
herself
florine
or
dorine
francie
added
miss
dosson
you
re
too
rare
marguerite
de
cliche
exclaimed
giving
a
long
moan
of
pain
which
ended
in
an
incongruous
laugh
then
you
ve
been
three
to
it
she
went
on
that
accounts
for
its
perfection
francie
disengaged
herself
again
from
mme
de
brecourt
and
went
to
probert
who
stood
looking
down
at
the
fire
with
his
back
to
her
mr
probert
i
m
very
sorry
for
what
i
ve
done
to
distress
you
i
had
no
idea
you
d
all
feel
so
badly
i
didn
t
mean
any
harm
i
thought
you
d
like
the
old
man
turned
a
little
bending
his
eyes
on
her
but
without
taking
her
hand
as
she
had
hoped
usually
when
they
met
he
kissed
her
he
didn
t
look
angry
now
he
only
looked
very
a
strange
inarticulate
sound
a
chorus
of
amazement
and
mirth
came
from
the
others
when
she
said
she
thought
they
d
like
it
and
indeed
poor
francie
was
far
from
being
able
to
measure
the
droll
effect
of
that
speech
like
it
like
it
said
probert
staring
at
her
as
if
a
little
afraid
of
her
what
do
you
mean
she
admits
she
admits
mme
de
cliche
exulted
to
her
sister
did
you
arrange
it
all
that
day
in
the
bois
to
punish
me
for
having
tried
to
separate
you
she
pursued
to
the
poor
child
who
stood
gazing
up
piteously
at
the
old
man
i
don
t
know
what
he
has
published
i
haven
t
seen
it
i
don
t
understand
i
thought
it
was
only
to
be
a
piece
about
me
she
said
to
him
about
me
de
cliche
repeated
in
english
elle
est
divine
he
turned
away
raising
his
shoulders
and
hands
and
then
letting
them
fall
mme
de
brecourt
had
picked
up
the
newspaper
she
rolled
it
together
saying
to
francie
that
she
must
take
it
home
take
it
home
immediately
then
she
d
see
she
only
seemed
to
wish
to
get
her
out
of
the
room
but
probert
had
fixed
their
flushed
little
guest
with
his
sick
stare
you
gave
information
for
that
you
desired
it
why
didn
t
desire
it
but
flack
why
do
you
know
such
ruffians
where
was
your
father
the
old
man
groaned
i
thought
he
d
just
be
nice
about
my
picture
and
give
pleasure
to
waterlow
francie
went
on
i
thought
he
d
just
speak
about
my
being
engaged
and
give
a
little
account
so
many
people
in
america
would
be
so
many
people
in
america
that
s
just
the
dreadful
thought
my
dear
said
mme
de
brecourt
kindly
foyons
put
it
in
your
muff
and
tell
us
what
you
think
of
and
she
continued
to
thrust
forward
the
scandalous
journal
but
francie
took
no
notice
of
it
she
looked
round
from
probert
at
the
others
i
told
gaston
i
d
certainly
do
something
you
wouldn
t
well
he
ll
believe
it
now
cried
mme
de

my
poor

francie
turned
upon
her
beautiful
dilated
eyes
in
which
a
world
of
new
wonders
and
fears
had
suddenly
got
itself
reflected
he
ll
see
it
over
there
he
has
seen
it
oh
my
dear

news
of
him
don
t

in
high
derision
from

paper
her
young
friend
went
on
to
probert
it
was
not
directed
in
his
hand
de
brecourt
pronounced
there
was
some
stamp
on
the
band
it
came
from
the
mr
flack
is
that
his
hideous
name
must
have
seen
to
that
mme
de
brecourt
suggested
or
perhaps
florine
de
cliche
interposed
i
should
like
to
get
hold
of
florine
i
did
i
did
tell
him
so
francie
repeated
with
all
her
fevered
candour
alluding
to
her
statement
of
a
moment
before
and
speaking
as
if
she
thought
the
circumstance
detracted
from
the
offence
so
did
i
so
did
we
all
said
mme
de
cliche
and
will
he
suffer
as
you
suffer
francie
continued
appealing
to
probert
suffer

he
ll
die
cried
the
old
man
however
i
won
t
answer
for
him
he
ll
tell
you
himself
when
he
he
ll
die
echoed
francie
with
the
eyes
of
a
child
at
the
pantomime
who
has
found
the
climax
turning
to
demons
or
monsters
or
too
much
gunpowder
he
ll
never
return
how
can
he
show
himself
said
mme
de
cliche
that
s
not
true
he
ll
come
back
to
stand
by
me
the
girl
flashed
out
how
couldn
t
you
feel
us
to
be
the
last
the
very
last
asked
probert
with
great
gentleness
how
couldn
t
you
feel
my
poor
son
to
be
the
last
c
est
un
sens
qui
lui
manque
shrilled
implacably
mme
de
cliche
let
her
go
papa
do
let
her
go
home
mme
de
brecourt
pleaded
surely
that
s
the
only
place
for
her
the
elder
sister
continued
yes
my
child
you
oughtn
t
to
be
here
it
s
your
father
he
ought
to
understand
said
probert
for
god
s
sake
don
t
send
for
him
let
it
all
stop
and
mme
de
cliche
made
wild
gestures
francie
looked
at
her
as
she
had
never
looked
at
any
one
in
her
life
and
then
said
probert
give
her
your
arm
take
her
to
the
carriage
she
heard
mme
de
brecourt
growl
to
her
husband
she
got
to
the
door
she
hardly
knew
how
she
was
only
conscious
that
susan
held
her
once
more
long
enough
to
kiss
her
poor
susan
wanted
to
comfort
her
that
showed
how
bad
feeling
as
she
did
she
believed
the
whole
business
would
yet
be
it
would
be
bad
because
gaston
gaston
francie
didn
t
complete
that
thought
yet
only
gaston
was
in
her
mind
as
she
hurried
to
the
carriage
de
brecourt
hurried
beside
her
she
wouldn
t
take
his
arm
but
he
opened
the
door
for
her
and
as
she
got
in
she
heard
him
murmur
in
the
strangest
and
most
unexpected
manner
you
re
charming
mademoiselle
charming
charming
xii
her
absence
had
not
been
long
and
when
she
the
familiar
salon
at
the
hotel
she
found
her
father
and
sister
sitting
there
together
as
if
they
had
timed
her
by
their
watches
a
prey
both
of
them
to
curiosity
and
suspense
dosson
however
gave
no
sign
of
impatience
he
only
looked
at
her
in
silence
through
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
he
profaned
the
red
satin
splendour
with
perpetual
fumes
as
she
burst
into
the
room
an
irruption
she
made
of
her
desired
reappearance
she
rushed
to
one
of
the
tables
flinging
down
her
muff
and
gloves
while
delia
who
had
sprung
up
as
she
came
in
caught
her
closely
and
glared
into
her
face
with
a
francie
dosson
what
have
you
been
through
francie
said
nothing
at
first
only
shutting
her
eyes
and
letting
her
sister
do
what
she
would
with
her
she
has
been
crying
poppa
she
has
delia
almost
shouted
pulling
her
down
upon
a
sofa
and
fairly
shaking
her
as
she
continued
will
you
please
tell
i
ve
been
perfectly
wild
yes
you
have
you
dreadful
the
elder
girl
insisted
kissing
her
on
the
eyes
they
opened
at
this
compassionate
pressure
and
francie
rested
their
troubled
light
on
her
father
who
had
now
risen
to
his
feet
and
stood
with
his
back
to
the
fire
why
chicken
said
dosson
you
look
as
if
you
had
had
quite
a
i
told
you
i
should
i
told
you
i
told
you
francie
broke
out
with
a
trembling
voice
and
now
it
s
come
you
don
t
mean
to
say
you
ve
done
anything
cried
delia
very
white
it
s
all
over
it
s
all
over
with
which
francie
s
face
braved
denial
are
you
crazy
francie
delia
demanded
i
m
sure
you
look
as
if
you
ain
t
you
going
to
be
married
childie
asked
dosson
all
considerately
but
coming
nearer
to
her
francie
sprang
up
releasing
herself
from
her
sister
and
threw
her
arms
round
him
will
you
take
me
away
poppa
will
you
take
me
right
straight
away
of
course
i
will
my
precious
i
ll
take
you
anywhere
i
don
t
want
anything
it
wasn
t
my
idea
and
dosson
and
delia
looked
at
each
other
while
the
girl
pressed
her
face
upon
his
shoulder
i
never
heard
such
trash
you
can
t
behave
that
way
has
he
got
engaged
to
some
one
else
in
america
delia
threw
out
why
if
it
s
over
it
s
over
i
guess
it
s
all
right
said
dosson
kissing
his
younger
daughter
i
ll
go
back
or
i
ll
go
on
i
ll
go
anywhere
you
you
won
t
have
your
daughters
insulted
i
presume
delia
cried
if
you
don
t
tell
me
this
moment
what
has
happened
she
pursued
to
her
sister
i
ll
drive
straight
round
there
and
make
have
they
insulted
you
sweetie
asked
the
old
man
bending
over
his
child
who
simply
leaned
on
him
with
her
hidden
face
and
no
sound
of
tears
francie
raised
her
head
turning
round
to
their
companion
did
i
ever
tell
you
anything
else
did
i
ever
believe
in
it
for
an
hour
oh
well
if
you
ve
done
it
on
purpose
to
triumph
over
me
we
might
as
well
go
home
certainly
but
i
guess
delia
added
you
had
better
just
wait
till
gaston
it
will
be
worse
when
he
comes
if
he
thinks
the
same
as
they
have
they
insulted
you
have
they
dosson
repeated
while
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
curling
round
the
question
gave
him
the
air
of
putting
it
with
placidity
they
think
i
ve
insulted
them
they
re
in
an
awful
state
they
re
almost
dead
flack
has
put
it
into
the
paper
everything
i
don
t
know
what
and
they
think
it
s
too
wicked
they
were
all
there
together
all
at
me
at
once
weeping
and
wailing
and
gnashing
their
teeth
i
never
saw
people
so
delia
s
face
grew
big
with
her
stare
so
affected
ah
yes
i
guess
there
s
a
good
deal
of
that
said
dosson
it
s
too
real
too
terrible
you
don
t
understand
it
s
all
printed
there
that
they
re
immoral
and
everything
about
them
everything
that
s
private
and
dreadful
francie
explained
immoral
is
that
so
dosson
threw
off
and
about
me
too
and
about
gaston
and
my
marriage
and
all
sorts
of
personalities
and
all
the
names
and
mme
de
villepreux
and
everything
it
s
all
printed
there
and
they
ve
read
it
it
says
one
of
them
will
you
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
what
you
re
talking
about
delia
enquired
sternly
where
is
it
printed
and
what
have
we
got
to
do
with
it
some
one
sent
it
and
i
told
do
you
mean
his
paper
oh
the
horrid
ape
delia
cried
with
passion
do
they
mind
so
what
they
see
in
the
papers
asked
dosson
i
guess
they
haven
t
seen
what
i
ve
seen
why
there
used
to
be
things
about
me
well
it
is
about
us
too
about
every
one
they
think
it
s
the
same
as
if
i
wrote
it
francie
ruefully
mentioned
well
you
know
what
you
could
do
and
dosson
beamed
at
her
for
common
cheer
do
you
mean
that
piece
about
your
picture
that
you
told
me
about
when
you
went
with
him
again
to
see
it
delia
demanded
oh
i
don
t
know
what
piece
it
is
i
haven
t
seen
haven
t
seen
it
didn
t
they
show
it
to
you
yes
but
i
couldn
t
read
it
mme
de
brecourt
wanted
me
to
take
it
but
i
left
it
well
that
s
like
you
like
the
tauchnitzes
littering
up
our
track
i
ll
be
bound
i
d
see
it
delia
declared
hasn
t
it
come
doesn
t
it
always
come
i
guess
we
haven
t
had
the
last
unless
it
s
somewhere
round
said
dosson
poppa
go
out
and
get
it
you
can
buy
it
on
the
boulevard
delia
continued
francie
what
did
you
want
to
tell
him
i
didn
t
know
i
was
just
conversing
he
seemed
to
take
so
much
interest
francie
pleaded
oh
he
s
a
deep
one
groaned
delia
well
if
folks
are
immoral
you
can
t
keep
it
out
of
the
papers
and
i
don
t
know
as
you
ought
to
want
to
dosson
remarked
if
they
are
i
m
glad
to
know
it
and
he
gave
his
younger
daughter
a
glance
apparently
intended
to
show
that
in
this
case
he
should
know
what
to
do
but
francie
was
looking
at
her
sister
as
if
her
attention
had
been
arrested
how
do
you
mean
a
deep
one
why
he
wanted
to
break
it
off
the
fiend
francie
stared
then
a
deeper
flush
leapt
to
her
face
already
mottled
as
with
the
fine
footprints
of
the
proberts
dancing
for
pain
to
break
off
my
engagement
yes
just
that
but
i
ll
be
hanged
if
he
shall
poppa
will
you
allow
that
allow
what
why
flack
s
vile
interference
you
won
t
let
him
do
as
he
likes
with
us
i
suppose
will
you
it
s
all
done
it
s
all
done
said
francie
the
tears
had
suddenly
started
into
her
eyes
again
well
he
s
so
smart
that
it
is
likely
he
s
too
smart
her
father
allowed
but
what
did
they
want
you
to
do
about
it
that
s
what
want
to
know
they
wanted
me
to
say
i
knew
nothing
about
it
but
i
couldn
but
you
didn
t
and
you
don
t
if
you
haven
t
even
read
it
delia
almost
yelled
where
is
the
d
thing
their
companion
asked
looking
helplessly
about
him
on
the
boulevard
at
the
very
first
of
those
kiosks
you
come
to
that
old
woman
has
it
the
one
who
speaks
english
she
always
has
it
do
go
and
get
it
do
and
delia
pushed
him
looked
for
his
hat
for
him
i
knew
he
wanted
to
print
something
and
i
can
t
say
i
didn
t
francie
said
i
thought
he
d
crack
up
my
portrait
and
that
waterlow
would
like
that
and
gaston
and
every
one
and
he
talked
to
me
about
the
paper
he
s
always
doing
that
and
always
was
and
i
didn
t
see
the
harm
but
even
just
knowing
him
they
think
that
s
well
i
should
hope
we
can
know
whom
we
like
and
delia
bounced
fairly
round
as
from
the
force
of
her
high
spirit
dosson
had
put
on
his
hat
he
was
going
out
for
the
paper
why
he
kept
us
alive
last
year
he
uttered
in
tribute
well
he
seems
to
have
killed
us
now
delia
cried
well
don
t
give
up
an
old
friend
her
father
urged
with
his
hand
on
the
door
and
don
t
back
down
on
anything
you
ve
lord
what
a
fuss
about
an
old
newspaper
delia
went
on
in
her
exasperation
it
must
be
about
two
weeks
old
anyway
didn
t
they
ever
see
a
before
they
can
t
have
seen
much
said
dosson
he
paused
still
with
his
hand
on
the
door
don
t
you
worry
gaston
will
make
it
all
gaston
it
will
kill
gaston
is
that
what
they
say
delia
demanded
gaston
will
never
look
at
me
well
then
he
ll
have
to
look
at
me
said
dosson
do
you
mean
that
he
ll
give
you
up
he
ll
be
so
crawling
delia
went
on
they
say
he
s
just
the
one
who
ll
feel
it
most
but
i
m
the
one
who
does
that
said
francie
with
a
strange
smile
they
re
stuffing
you
with
lies
because
they
don
t
like
it
he
ll
be
tender
and
true
delia
glared
when
they
hate
me
never
and
francie
shook
her
head
slowly
still
with
her
smile
of
softness
that
s
what
he
cared
for
most
to
make
them
like
and
isn
t
he
a
gentleman
i
should
like
to
know
asked
delia
yes
and
that
s
why
i
won
t
marry
him
if
i
ve
injured
shucks
he
has
seen
the
papers
over
there
you
wait
till
he
comes
dosson
enjoined
passing
out
of
the
room
the
girls
remained
there
together
and
after
a
moment
delia
resumed
well
he
has
got
to
fix
it
that
s
one
thing
i
can
tell
who
has
got
to
fix
it
why

villainous
man
he
has
got
to
publish
another
piece
saying
it
s
all
false
or
all
a
yes

said
francie
with
a
weak
laugh

t
mean
to
say
he
s
gone
down
to

t
he

as
soon
as
he
came
back
from
london
going
right
through
without
stopping
i
don
t
know
but
he

said
delia
then
she
added
the
mean
coward

do
you
say
that
he
can
t
hide
at
nice

find
him

they
going

francie

on
how
can
you
protect
him

to
him
again
her
sister
engaged
francie
had
a
pause
i
can
protect
him
without
speaking
to
him
i
can
tell
the
simple
truth
that
he
didn
t
print
a
word
but
what
i
told
i
d
like
to
see
him
not
delia
fairly
hooted
when
did
he
grow
so
particular
he
fixed
it
up
she
said
with
assurance
they
always
do
in
the
papers
they
d
be
ashamed
if
they
didn
t
well
now
he
has
got
to
bring
out
a
piece
praising
them
up
praising
them
to
the
skies
that
s
what
he
has
got
to
do
she
wound
up
with
decision
praising
them
up
they
ll
hate
that
worse
francie
returned
musingly
delia
stared
what
on
earth
then
do
they
want
francie
had
sunk
to
the
sofa
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
carpet
she
gave
no
reply
to
this
question
but
presently
said
we

first
hour

i
don
t
care
where

don
t
want

when
they
were
all
ranting
and
raving
at
me
just
now
i
wished

there
i
told
them

t
her
companion

herself
in

of
her
francie
dosson
if

simple

oh
i
wish

francie
wailed
after
which
she
suddenly
shivered
and
then
she
added
that
she
was
sick
she
was
going
to
bed
and
her
sister
took
her
off
to
her
room
dosson
that
afternoon
sitting
by
his
younger
daughter
s
bedside
read
the
dreadful
piece
out
to
both
his
children
from
the
copy
of
the
reverberator
he
had
secured
on
the
boulevard
it
is
a
remarkable
fact
that
as
a
family
they
were
rather
disappointed
in
this
composition
in
which
their
curiosity
found
less
to
repay
it
than
it
had
expected
their
resentment
against
flack
less
to
stimulate
it
their
fluttering
effort
to
take
the
point
of
view
of
the
proberts
less
to
sustain
it
and
their
acceptance
of
the
promulgation
of
francie
s
innocent
remarks
as
a
natural
incident
of
the
life
of
the
day
less
to
make
them
reconsider
it
the
letter
from
paris
appeared
lively
chatty
highly
calculated
to
please
and
so
far
as
the
personalities
contained
in
it
were
concerned
dosson
wanted
to
know
if
they
weren
t
aware
over
here
of
the
charges
brought
every
day
against
the
most
prominent
men
in
boston
if
there
was
anything
in
that
style
they
might
talk
he
said
and
he
scanned
the
effusion
afresh
with
a
certain
surprise
at
not
finding
in
it
some
imputation
of
pecuniary
malversation
the
effect
of
an
acquaintance
with
the
text
was
to
depress
delia
who
didn
t
exactly
see
what
there
was
in
it
to
take
back
or
explain
away
however
she
was
aware
there
were
some
points
they
didn
t
understand
and
doubtless
these
were
the
scandalous
places
the
things
that
had
so
worked
up
the
proberts
but
why
should
they
have
minded
if
other
people
didn
t
understand
the
allusions
these
were
peculiar
but
peculiarly
incomprehensible
any
better
than
she
did
the
whole
thing
struck
francie
herself
as
infinitely
less
lurid
than
mme
de
brecourt
s
account
of
it
and
the
part
about
her
own
situation
and
her
beautiful
picture
seemed
to
make
even
less
of
the
subject
than
it
easily
might
have
done
it
was
scanty
it
was
skimpy
and
if
waterlow
was
offended
it
wouldn
t
be
because
they
had
published
too
much
about
him
it
was
nevertheless
clear
to
her
that
there
were
a
lot
of
things
she
hadn
t
told
flack
as
well
as
a
great
many
she
had
perhaps
those
were
the
things
that
lady
had
put
in
florine
or
dorine
the
one
she
had
mentioned
at
mme
de
brecourt
s
all
the
same
if
the
communication
in
the
reverberator
let
them
down
at
the
hotel
more
gently
than
had
seemed
likely
and
bristled
so
much
less
than
was
to
have
been
feared
with
explanations
of
the
anguish
of
the
proberts
this
didn
t
diminish
the
girl
s
sense
of
responsibility
nor
make
the
case
a
whit
less
grave
it
only
showed
how
sensitive
and
fastidious
the
proberts
were
and
therefore
with
what
difficulty
they
would
come
round
to
condonation
moreover
francie
made
another
reflexion
as
she
lay
there
for
delia
kept
her
in
bed
nearly
three
days
feeling
this
to
be
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
an
effectual
reply
to
any
absurd
heroics
about
leaving
paris
perhaps
they
had
got
francie
said
to
herself
perhaps
they
had
read
so
many
such
bad
things
that
they
had
lost
the
delicacy
of
their
palate
as
people
were
said
to
do
who
lived
on
food
too
violently
spiced
then
very
weak
and
vague
and
passive
as
she
was
now
in
the
bedimmed
room
in
the
soft
parisian
bed
and
with
delia
treating
her
as
much
as
possible
like
a
sick
person
she
thought
of
the
lively
and
chatty
letters
they
had
always
seen
in
the
papers
and
wondered
if
they
all
meant
a
violation
of
sanctities
a
convulsion
of
homes
a
burning
of
smitten
faces
a
rupture
of
girls
engagements
it
was
present
to
her
as
an
agreeable
negative
i
must
add
that
her
father
and
sister
took
no
strenuous
view
of
her
responsibility
or
of
their
own
they
neither
brought
the
matter
home
to
her
as
a
crime
nor
made
her
worse
through
her
feeling
them
anxiously
understate
their
blame
there
was
a
pleasant
cheerful
helplessness
in
her
father
on
this
head
as
on
every
other
there
could
be
no
more
discussion
among
them
on
such
a
question
than
there
had
ever
been
for
none
was
needed
to
show
that
for
these
candid
minds
the
newspapers
and
all
they
contained
were
a
part
of
the
general
fatality
of
things
of
the
recurrent
freshness
of
the
universe
coming
out
like
the
sun
in
the
morning
or
the
stars
at
night
or
the
wind
and
the
weather
at
all
times
the
thing
that
worried
francie
most
while
delia
kept
her
in
bed
was
the
apprehension
of
what
her
father
might
do
but
this
was
not
a
fear
of
what
he
might
do
to
flack
he
would
go
round
perhaps
to
probert
s
or
to
mme
de
brecourt
s
and
reprimand
them
for
having
made
things
so
rough
to
his
it
was
true
she
had
scarcely
ever
seen
him
reprimand
any
one
for
anything
but
on
the
other
hand
nothing
like
this
had
ever
happened
before
to
her
or
to
delia
they
had
made
each
other
cry
once
or
twice
but
no
one
else
had
ever
made
them
and
no
one
had
ever
broken
out
on
them
that
way
and
frightened
them
half
to
death
francie
wanted
her
father
not
to
go
round
she
had
a
sense
that
those
other
people
had
somehow
stores
of
comparison
of
propriety
of
superiority
in
any
discussion
which
he
couldn
t
command
she
wanted
nothing
done
and
no
communication
to
pass
only
a
proud
unbickering
silence
on
the
part
of
the
dossons
if
the
proberts
made
a
noise
and
they
made
none
it
would
be
they
who
would
have
the
best
appearance
moreover
now
with
each
elapsing
day
she
felt
she
did
wish
to
see
gaston
about
it
her
desire
was
to
wait
counting
the
hours
so
that
she
might
just
clearly
explain
saying
two
or
three
things
perhaps
these
things
wouldn
t
make
it
better
very
likely
they
wouldn
t
but
at
any
rate
nothing
would
have
been
done
in
the
interval
at
least
on
her
part
and
her
father
s
and
delia
s
to
make
it
worse
she
told
her
father
that
she
wouldn
t
as
delia
put
it
want
to
have
him
go
round
and
was
in
some
degree
relieved
at
perceiving
that
he
didn
t
seem
very
clear
as
to
what
it
was
open
to
him
to
say
to
their
alienated
friends
he
wasn
t
afraid
but
was
uncertain
his
relation
to
almost
everything
that
had
happened
to
them
as
a
family
from
a
good
while
back
was
a
sense
of
the
absence
of
precedents
and
precedents
were
particularly
absent
now
for
he
had
never
before
seen
a
lot
of
people
in
a
rage
about
a
piece
in
the
paper
delia
also
reassured
her
she
said
she
d
see
to
it
that
poppa
didn
t
sneak
round
she
communicated
to
her
indeed
that
he
hadn
t
the
smallest
doubt
that
gaston
in
a
few
days
would
blow
them
up
all
them
down
there
much
higher
than
they
had
blown
her
and
that
he
was
very
sorry
he
had
let
her
go
down
herself
on
that
sort
of
summons
it
was
for
her
and
the
rest
to
come
to
francie
and
to
him
and
if
they
had
anything
practical
to
say
they
d
arrive
in
a
body
yet
if
dosson
had
the
sense
of
his
daughter
s
having
been
roughly
handled
he
derived
some
of
the
consolation
of
amusement
from
his
persistent
humorous
view
of
the
proberts
as
a
if
they
were
consistent
with
their
character
or
with
their
complaint
they
would
move
en
masse
upon
the
hotel
and
he
hung
about
at
home
a
good
deal
as
if
to
wait
for
them
delia
intimated
to
her
sister
that
this
vision
cheered
them
up
as
they
sat
they
two
in
the
red
salon
while
francie
was
in
bed
of
course
it
didn
t
exhilarate
this
young
lady
and
she
even
looked
for
no
brighter
side
now
she
knew
almost
nothing
but
her
sharp
little
ache
of
suspense
her
presentiment
of
gaston
s
horror
which
grew
all
the
while
delia
remarked
to
her
once
that
he
would
have
seen
lots
of
over
there
he
would
have
become
familiar
but
this
only
suggested
to
the
girl
she
had
at
present
strange
new
moments
and
impulses
of
quick
reasoning
that
they
would
only
prepare
him
to
be
disgusted
not
to
be
indifferent
his
disgust
would
be
colder
than
anything
she
had
ever
known
and
would
complete
her
knowledge
of
him
make
her
understand
him
properly
for
the
first
time
she
would
just
meet
it
as
briefly
as
possible
it
would
wind
up
the
business
close
the
incident
and
all
would
be
over
he
didn
t
write
that
proved
it
in
advance
there
had
now
been
two
or
three
mails
without
a
letter
he
had
seen
the
paper
in
boston
or
in
new
york
and
it
had
simply
struck
him
dumb
it
was
very
well
for
delia
to
say
that
of
course
he
didn
t
write
when
he
was
on
the
ocean
how
could
they
get
his
letters
even
if
he
did
there
had
been
time
before
before
he
sailed
though
delia
represented
that
people
never
wrote
then
they
were
ever
so
much
too
busy
at
the
last
and
were
going
to
see
their
correspondents
in
a
few
days
anyway
the
only
missives
that
came
to
francie
were
a
copy
of
the
reverberator
addressed
in
flack
s
hand
and
with
a
great
inkmark
on
the
margin
of
the
fatal
letter
and
three
intense
pages
from
mme
de
brecourt
received
hours
after
the
scene
at
her
house
this
lady
expressed
herself
as
follows
my
dear
francie
i
felt
very
badly
after
you
had
gone
yesterday
morning
and
i
had
twenty
minds
to
go
and
see
you
but
we
ve
talked
it
over
conscientiously
and
it
appears
to
us
that
we
ve
no
right
to
take
any
such
step
till
gaston
arrives
the
situation
isn
t
exclusively
ours
but
belongs
to
him
as
well
and
we
feel
we
ought
to
make
it
over
to
him
in
as
simple
and
compact
a
form
as
possible
therefore
as
we
regard
it
we
had
better
not
touch
it
it
s
so
delicate
isn
t
it
my
poor
child
but
leave
it
just
as
it
is
they
think
i
even
exceed
my
powers
in
writing
you
these
simple
lines
and
that
once
your
participation
has
been
constatee
which
was
the
only
advantage
of
that
dreadful
scene
everything
should
stop
but
i
ve
liked
you
francie
i
ve
believed
in
you
and
i
don
t
wish
you
to
be
able
to
say
that
in
spite
of
the
thunderbolt
you
ve
drawn
down
on
us
i
ve
not
treated
you
with
tenderness
it
s
a
thunderbolt
indeed
my
poor
and
innocent
but
disastrous
little
friend
we
re
hearing
more
of
it
already
the
horrible
republican
papers
here
have
as
we
know
already
got
hold
of
the
unspeakable
sheet
and
are
preparing
to
reproduce
the
article
that
is
such
parts
of
it
as
they
may
put
forward
with
innuendoes
and
to
eke
out
the
rest
without
exposing
themselves
to
a
suit
for
defamation
poor
leonie
de
villepreux
has
been
with
us
constantly
and
jeanne
and
her
husband
have
telegraphed
that
we
may
expect
them
day
after
they
are
evidently
immensely
emotionnes
for
they
almost
never
telegraph
they
wish
so
to
receive
gaston
we
have
determined
all
the
same
to
be
intensely
quiet
and
that
will
be
sure
to
be
his
view
alphonse
and
maxime
now
recognise
that
it
s
best
to
leave
flack
alone
hard
as
it
is
to
keep
one
s
hands
off
him
have
you
anything
to
lui
faire
dire
to
my
precious
brother
when
he
arrives
but
it
s
foolish
of
me
to
ask
you
that
for
you
had
much
better
not
answer
this
you
will
no
doubt
have
an
opportunity
to
say
to
him
whatever
my
dear
francie
you
can
say
it
will
matter
comparatively
little
that
you
may
never
be
able
to
say
it
to
your
friend
with
every
allowance
suzanne
de
brecourt
francie
looked
at
this
letter
and
tossed
it
away
without
reading
it
delia
picked
it
up
read
it
to
her
father
who
didn
t
understand
it
and
kept
it
in
her
possession
poring
over
it
as
flack
had
seen
her
pore
over
the
cards
that
were
left
while
she
was
out
or
over
the
registers
of
american
travellers
they
knew
of
gaston
s
arrival
by
his
telegraphing
from
havre
he
came
back
by
the
french
line
and
he
mentioned
the
hour
about
at
which
he
should
reach
paris
delia
after
dinner
made
her
father
take
her
to
the
circus
so
that
francie
should
be
left
alone
to
receive
her
intended
who
would
be
sure
to
hurry
round
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
girl
herself
expressed
no
preference
whatever
on
this
point
and
the
idea
was
one
of
delia
s
masterly
ones
her
flashes
of
inspiration
there
was
never
any
difficulty
about
imposing
such
conceptions
on
poppa
but
at
ten
when
they
returned
the
young
man
had
not
appeared
and
francie
remained
only
long
enough
to
say
i
told
you
so
with
a
white
face
and
march
off
to
her
room
with
her
candle
she
locked
herself
in
and
her
sister
couldn
t
get
at
her
that
night
it
was
another
of
delia
s
inspirations
not
to
try
after
she
had
felt
that
the
door
was
fast
she
forbore
in
the
exercise
of
a
great
discretion
but
she
herself
for
the
ensuing
hours
slept
no
wink
nevertheless
the
next
morning
as
early
as
ten
o
clock
she
had
the
energy
to
drag
her
father
out
to
the
banker
s
and
to
keep
him
out
two
hours
it
would
be
inconceivable
now
that
gaston
shouldn
t
turn
up
before
dejeuner
he
did
turn
up
about
eleven
o
clock
he
came
in
and
found
francie
alone
she
noticed
for
strangeness
that
he
was
very
pale
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
sunburnt
also
that
he
didn
t
for
an
instant
smile
at
her
it
was
very
certain
there
was
no
bright
flicker
in
her
own
face
and
they
had
the
most
singular
the
most
unnatural
meeting
he
only
said
as
he
arrived
i
couldn
t
come
last
evening
they
made
it
impossible
they
were
all
there
and
we
were
up
till
three
o
clock
this
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
through
terrible
things
and
it
wasn
t
simply
the
strain
of
his
attention
to
so
much
business
in
america
what
passed
next
she
couldn
t
remember
afterwards
it
seemed
but
a
few
seconds
before
he
said
to
her
slowly
holding
her
hand
before
this
he
had
pressed
his
lips
to
hers
silently
is
it
true
francie
what
they
say
and
they
swear
to
it
that
you
told
that
blackguard
those
horrors
that
that
infamous
letter
s
only
a
report
of
your
talk
i
told
him
everything
it
s
all
me
me
me
the
girl
replied
exaltedly
without
pretending
to
hesitate
an
instant
as
to
what
he
might
mean
gaston
looked
at
her
with
deep
eyes
then
walked
straight
away
to
the
window
and
remained
there
in
silence
she
herself
said
nothing
more
at
last
the
young
man
went
on
and
i
who
insisted
to
them
that
there
was
no
natural
delicacy
like
yours
well
you
ll
never
need
to
insist
about
anything
any
more
she
cried
and
with
this
she
dashed
out
of
the
room
by
the
nearest
door
when
delia
and
dosson
returned
the
red
salon
was
empty
and
francie
was
again
locked
in
her
room
but
this
time
her
sister
forced
an
entrance
xiii
dosson
as
we
know
was
almost
more
than
anything
else
loosely
contemplative
and
the
present
occasion
could
only
minister
to
that
side
of
his
nature
especially
as
so
far
at
least
as
his
observation
of
his
daughters
went
it
had
not
urged
him
into
uncontrollable
movement
but
the
truth
is
that
the
intensity
or
rather
the
continuity
of
his
meditations
did
engender
an
act
not
perceived
by
these
young
ladies
though
its
consequences
presently
became
definite
enough
while
he
waited
for
the
proberts
to
arrive
in
a
phalanx
and
noted
that
they
failed
to
do
so
he
had
plenty
of
time
to
ask
himself
and
also
to
ask
delia
questions
about
flack
so
far
as
they
were
addressed
to
his
daughter
they
were
promptly
answered
for
delia
had
been
ready
from
the
first
as
we
have
seen
to
pronounce
upon
the
conduct
of
the
young
journalist
her
view
of
it
was
clearer
every
hour
there
was
a
difference
however
in
the
course
of
action
which
she
judged
this
view
to
demand
at
first
he
was
to
have
been
blown
up
for
the
mess
he
had
got
them
into
profitless
as
the
process
might
be
and
vain
the
satisfaction
he
was
to
have
been
scourged
with
the
sharpest
lashes
the
sense
of
violated
confidence
could
inflict
at
present
he
was
not
to
be
touched
with
a
pole
but
rather
cut
dead
cast
off
and
ignored
let
alone
to
his
dying
day
delia
quickly
caught
at
this
for
the
right
grand
way
of
showing
displeasure
such
was
the
manner
in
which
she
characterised
it
in
her
frequent
conversations
with
her
father
if
that
can
be
called
conversation
which
consisted
of
his
serenely
smoking
while
she
poured
forth
arguments
that
kept
repetition
abreast
of
variety
the
same
cause
will
according
to
application
produce
effects
without
sameness
as
a
mark
of
which
truth
the
catastrophe
that
made
delia
express
freely
the
hope
she
might
never
again
see
so
much
as
the
end
of
flack
s
nose
had
just
the
opposite
action
on
her
parent
the
best
balm
for
his
mystification
would
have
been
to
let
his
eyes
sociably
travel
over
his
young
friend
s
whole
person
this
would
have
been
to
deal
again
with
quantities
and
forces
he
could
measure
and
in
terms
he
could
understand
if
indeed
the
difference
had
been
pushed
further
the
girl
would
have
kept
the
field
for
she
had
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
motive
her
attitude
to
which
dosson
could
have
opposed
but
an
indefensible
in
fact
an
inarticulate
laxity
she
had
touched
on
her
deepest
conviction
in
saying
to
francie
that
the
correspondent
of
the
reverberator
had
played
them
that
trick
on
purpose
to
get
them
into
such
trouble
with
the
proberts
that
he
might
see
his
own
hopes
bloom
again
in
the
heat
of
their
disaster
this
had
many
of
the
appearances
of
a
strained
interpretation
but
that
didn
t
prevent
delia
from
placing
it
before
her
father
several
times
an
hour
it
mattered
little
that
he
should
remark
in
return
that
he
didn
t
see
what
good
it
could
do
flack
that
francie
and
he
and
delia
for
all
he
could
guess
should
be
disgusted
with
him
to
dosson
s
mind
that
was
such
a
queer
way
of
reasoning
delia
maintained
that
she
understood
perfectly
though
she
couldn
t
explain
and
at
any
rate
she
didn
t
want
the
manoeuvring
creature
to
come
flying
back
from
nice
she
didn
t
want
him
to
know
there
had
been
a
scandal
that
they
had
a
grievance
against
him
that
any
one
had
so
much
as
heard
of
his
article
or
cared
what
he
published
or
didn
t
publish
above
all
she
didn
t
want
him
to
know
that
the
proberts
had
cooled
off
she
didn
t
want
him
to
dream
he
could
have
had
such
effects
mixed
up
with
this
high
rigour
on
miss
dosson
s
part
was
the
oddest
secret
complacency
of
reflexion
that
in
consequence
of
what
flack
had
published
the
great
american
community
was
in
a
position
to
know
with
what
fine
folks
francie
and
she
were
associated
she
hoped
that
some
of
the
people
who
used
only
to
call
when
they
were
off
would
take
the
lesson
to
heart
while
she
glowed
with
this
consolation
as
well
as
with
the
resentment
for
which
it
was
required
her
father
quietly
addressed
a
few
words
by
letter
to
their
young
friend
in
the
south
this
communication
was
not
of
a
minatory
order
it
expressed
on
the
contrary
the
loose
sociability
which
was
the
essence
of
the
good
gentleman
s
nature
he
wanted
to
see
flack
to
talk
the
whole
thing
over
and
the
desire
to
hold
him
to
an
account
would
play
but
a
small
part
in
the
interview
it
commended
itself
much
more
to
him
that
the
touchiness
of
the
proberts
should
be
a
sign
of
a
family
of
cranks
so
little
did
any
experience
of
his
own
match
it
than
that
a
had
misbehaved
in
trying
to
turn
out
an
attractive
piece
as
the
happened
to
be
the
person
with
whom
he
had
most
consorted
for
some
time
back
he
felt
drawn
to
him
in
presence
of
a
new
problem
and
somehow
it
didn
t
seem
to
dosson
to
disqualify
him
as
a
source
of
comfort
that
it
was
just
he
who
had
been
the
fountain
of
injury
the
injury
wouldn
t
be
there
if
the
proberts
didn
t
point
to
it
with
a
thousand
ringers
moreover
dosson
couldn
t
turn
his
back
at
such
short
notice
on
a
man
who
had
smoked
so
many
of
his
cigars
ordered
so
many
of
his
dinners
and
helped
him
so
handsomely
to
spend
his
money
such
acts
constituted
a
bond
and
when
there
was
a
bond
people
gave
it
a
little
jerk
in
time
of
trouble
his
letter
to
nice
was
the
little
jerk
the
morning
after
francie
had
passed
with
such
an
air
from
gaston
s
sight
and
left
him
planted
in
the
salon
he
had
remained
ten
minutes
to
see
if
she
would
reappear
and
then
had
marched
out
of
the
hotel
she
received
by
the
first
post
a
letter
from
him
written
the
evening
before
it
conveyed
his
deep
regret
that
their
meeting
that
day
should
have
been
of
so
painful
so
unnatural
a
character
and
the
hope
that
she
didn
t
consider
as
her
strange
behaviour
had
seemed
to
suggest
that
she
had
anything
to
complain
of
there
was
too
much
he
wanted
to
say
and
above
all
too
much
he
wanted
to
ask
for
him
to
consent
to
the
indefinite
postponement
of
a
necessary
interview
there
were
explanations
assurances
de
part
et
d
autre
with
which
it
was
manifestly
impossible
that
either
of
them
should
dispense
he
would
therefore
propose
that
she
should
see
him
again
and
not
be
wanting
in
patience
to
that
end
late
on
the
morrow
he
didn
t
propose
an
earlier
moment
because
his
hands
were
terribly
full
at
home
frankly
speaking
the
state
of
things
there
was
of
the
worst
jane
and
her
husband
had
just
arrived
and
had
made
him
a
violent
an
unexpected
scene
two
of
the
french
newspapers
had
got
hold
of
the
article
and
had
given
the
most
perfidious
extracts
his
father
hadn
t
stirred
out
of
the
house
hadn
t
put
his
foot
inside
a
club
for
more
than
a
week
marguerite
and
maxime
were
immediately
to
start
for
england
on
an
indefinite
absence
they
couldn
t
face
their
life
in
paris
for
himself
he
was
in
the
breach
fighting
hard
and
making
on
her
behalf
asseverations
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
believe
in
spite
of
the
dreadful
defiant
confession
she
had
appeared
to
throw
at
him
in
the
morning
that
she
wouldn
t
virtually
confirm
he
would
come
in
as
soon
after
nine
as
possible
the
day
up
to
that
time
would
be
stiff
in
the
cours
la
reine
and
he
begged
her
in
the
meantime
not
to
doubt
of
his
perfect
tenderness
so
far
from
her
having
caused
it
at
all
to
shrink
he
had
never
yet
felt
her
to
have
in
his
affection
such
a
treasure
of
indulgence
to
draw
upon
a
couple
of
hours
after
the
receipt
of
this
manifesto
francie
lay
on
one
of
the
satin
sofas
with
her
eyes
closed
and
her
hand
clinched
upon
it
in
her
pocket
delia
sat
hard
by
with
a
needle
in
her
fingers
certain
morsels
of
silk
and
ribbon
in
her
lap
several
pins
in
her
mouth
and
her
attention
turning
constantly
from
her
work
to
her
sister
s
face
the
weather
was
now
so
completely
vernal
that
dosson
was
able
to
haunt
the
court
and
he
had
lately
resumed
this
practice
in
which
he
was
presumably
at
the
present
moment
absorbed
delia
had
lowered
her
needle
and
was
making
sure
if
her
companion
were
awake
she
had
been
perfectly
still
for
so
long
when
her
glance
was
drawn
to
the
door
which
she
heard
pushed
open
flack
stood
there
looking
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
young
ladies
as
to
see
which
would
be
most
agreeably
surprised
by
his
visit
i
saw
your
father
downstairs
he
says
it
s
all
right
said
the
journalist
advancing
with
a
brave
grin
he
told
me
to
come
straight
up
i
had
quite
a
talk
with
all
right
all
right
delia
dosson
repeated
springing
up
yes
indeed
i
should
say
so
then
she
checked
herself
asking
in
another
manner
is
that
so
poppa
sent
you
up
and
then
in
still
another
well
have
you
had
a
good
time
at
nice
you
d
better
all
come
right
down
and
see
it
s
lovely
down
there
if
you
ll
come
down
i
ll
go
right
back
i
guess
you
want
a
change
flack
went
on
he
spoke
to
delia
but
he
looked
at
francie
who
showed
she
had
not
been
asleep
by
the
quick
consciousness
with
which
she
raised
herself
on
her
sofa
she
gazed
at
the
visitor
with
parted
lips
but
uttered
no
word
he
barely
faltered
coming
toward
her
with
his
conscious
grimace
and
his
hand
out
his
knowing
eyes
were
more
knowing
than
ever
but
had
an
odd
appearance
of
being
smaller
like
penetrating
points
your
father
has
told
me
all
about
it
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
so
cheap
all
about
what
all
about
what
said
delia
whose
attempt
to
represent
happy
ignorance
was
menaced
by
an
intromission
of
ferocity
she
might
succeed
in
appearing
ignorant
but
could
scarcely
succeed
in
appearing
kind
francie
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
had
suffered
flack
to
possess
himself
for
a
moment
of
her
hand
but
neither
of
them
had
asked
the
young
man
to
sit
down
i
thought
you
were
going
to
stay
a
month
at
nice
delia
continued
well
i
was
but
your
father
s
letter
started
me
father
s
letter
he
wrote
me
about
the
row
didn
t
you
know
it
then
i
broke
you
didn
t
suppose
i
was
going
to
stay
down
there
when
there
were
such
times
up
gracious
delia
panted
is
it
pleasant
at
nice
is
it
very
gay
isn
t
it
very
hot
now
francie
rather
limply
asked
oh
it
s
all
right
but
i
haven
t
come
up
here
to
crow
about
nice
have
i
why
not
if
we
want
you
to
delia
spoke
up
flack
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
very
hard
in
the
whites
of
the
eyes
then
he
replied
turning
back
to
her
sister
anything
you
like
miss
francie
with
you
one
subject
s
as
good
as
another
can
t
we
sit
down
can
t
we
be
comfortable
he
added
comfortable
of
course
we
can
cried
delia
but
she
remained
erect
while
francie
sank
upon
the
sofa
again
and
their
companion
took
possession
of
the
nearest
chair
do
you
remember
what
i
told
you
once
that
the
people
will
have
the
plums
george
flack
asked
with
a
hard
buoyancy
of
the
younger
girl
she
looked
an
instant
as
if
she
were
trying
to
recollect
what
he
had
told
her
and
then
said
more
remotely
did
father
write
to
you
of
course
he
did
that
s
why
i
m
poor
father
sometimes
he
doesn
t
know
what
to
do
delia
threw
in
with
violence
he
told
me
the
reverberator
has
raised
a
breeze
i
guessed
that
for
myself
when
i
saw
the
way
the
papers
here
were
after
it
that
thing
will
go
the
rounds
you
ll
see
what
brought
me
was
learning
from
him
that
they
have
got
their
backs
what
on
earth
are
you
talking
about
delia
dosson
rang
out
flack
turned
his
eyes
on
her
own
as
he
had
done
a
moment
before
francie
sat
there
serious
looking
hard
at
the
carpet
what
game
are
you
trying
miss
delia
it
ain
t
true
you
care
what
i
wrote
is
it
he
pursued
addressing
himself
again
to
francie
after
a
moment
she
raised
her
eyes
did
you
write
it
yourself
what
do
you
care
what
he
wrote
or
what
does
any
one
care
delia
again
interposed
it
has
done
the
paper
more
good
than
anything
every
one
s
so
interested
said
flack
in
the
tone
of
reasonable
explanation
and
you
don
t
feel
you
ve
anything
to
complain
of
do
you
he
added
to
francie
kindly
do
you
mean
because
i
told
you
why
certainly
didn
t
it
all
spring
out
of
that
lovely
drive
and
that
walk
up
in
the
bois
we
had
when
you
took
me
up
to
see
your
portrait
didn
t
you
understand
that
i
wanted
you
to
know
that
the
public
would
appreciate
a
column
or
two
about
waterlow
s
new
picture
and
about
you
as
the
subject
of
it
and
about
your
being
engaged
to
a
member
of
the
grand
old
monde
and
about
what
was
going
on
in
the
grand
old
monde
which
would
naturally
attract
attention
through
that
why
miss
francie
flack
ever
so
blandly
pursued
you
regularly
talked
as
if
you
did
i
talk
a
great
deal
asked
francie
why
most
freely
it
was
too
lovely
we
had
a
real
grand
old
jaw
don
t
you
remember
when
we
sat
there
in
the
bois
oh
rubbish
delia
panted
yes
and
mme
de
cliche
and
you
told
me
she
was
scandalised
and
we
had
to
laugh
he
reminded
her
it
struck
us
as
so
idiotic
i
said
it
was
a
high
old
pose
and
i
knew
what
to
think
of
it
your
father
tells
me
she
s
scandalised
now
she
and
all
the
rest
of
them
at
the
sight
of
their
names
at
last
in
a
real
newspaper
well
now
if
you
want
to
know
it
s
a
bigger
pose
than
ever
and
as
i
said
just
now
it
s
too
damned
cheap
it
s
thin
that
s
what
it
is
and
if
it
were
genuine
it
wouldn
t
count
they
pretend
to
be
shocked
because
it
looks
exclusive
but
in
point
of
fact
they
like
it
are
you
talking
about
that
old
piece
in
the
paper
mercy
wasn
t
that
dead
and
buried
days
and
days
ago
delia
quavered
afresh
she
hovered
there
in
dismay
as
well
as
in
displeasure
upset
by
the
news
that
her
father
had
summoned
flack
to
paris
which
struck
her
almost
as
a
treachery
since
it
seemed
to
denote
a
plan
a
plan
and
an
uncommunicated
plan
on
dosson
s
part
was
unnatural
and
alarming
and
there
was
further
provocation
in
his
appearing
to
shirk
the
responsibility
of
it
by
not
having
come
up
at
such
a
moment
with
his
accomplice
delia
was
impatient
to
know
what
he
wanted
anyway
did
he
want
to
drag
them
down
again
to
such
commonness
ah
she
felt
the
commonness
now
even
though
it
could
hustle
did
he
want
to
put
flack
forward
with
a
feeble
flourish
that
didn
t
answer
one
of
their
questions
as
a
substitute
for
the
alienated
gaston
if
she
hadn
t
been
afraid
that
something
still
more
uncanny
than
anything
that
had
happened
yet
might
come
to
pass
between
her
two
companions
in
case
of
her
leaving
them
together
she
would
have
darted
down
to
the
court
to
appease
her
conjectures
to
challenge
her
father
and
tell
him
how
particularly
pleased
she
should
be
if
he
wouldn
t
put
in
his
oar
she
felt
liberated
however
the
next
moment
for
something
occurred
that
struck
her
as
a
sure
proof
of
the
state
of
her
sister
s
spirit
do
you
know
the
view
i
take
of
the
matter
according
to
what
your
father
has
told
me
flack
enquired
i
don
t
mean
it
was
he
gave
me
the
tip
i
guess
i
ve
seen
enough
over
here
by
this
time
to
have
worked
it
out
they
re
scandalised
all
right
they
re
blue
with
horror
and
have
never
heard
of
anything
so
dreadful
miss
francie
her
visitor
roared
that
ain
t
good
enough
for
you
and
me
they
know
what
s
in
the
papers
every
day
of
their
lives
and
they
know
how
it
got
there
they
ain
t
like
the
fellow
in
the
story
who
was
he
who
couldn
t
think
how
the
apples
got
into
the
dumplings
they
re
just
grabbing
a
pretext
to
break
because
because
well
they
don
t
think
you
re
blue
blood
they
re
delighted
to
strike
a
pretext
they
can
work
and
they
re
all
cackling
over
the
egg
it
has
taken
so
many
hens
of
em
to
lay
that
s
my
diagnosis
if
you
want
to
oh
how
can
you
say
such
a
thing
francie
returned
with
a
tremor
in
her
voice
that
struck
her
sister
her
eyes
met
delia
s
at
the
same
moment
and
this
young
woman
s
heart
bounded
with
the
sense
that
she
was
safe
flack
s
power
to
hustle
presumed
too
far
though
dosson
had
crude
notions
about
the
licence
of
the
press
she
felt
even
as
an
untutored
woman
what
a
false
step
he
was
now
taking
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
francie
who
was
not
impressed
the
particular
light
in
her
eyes
now
showed
it
could
be
trusted
to
allow
him
no
benefit
what
does
it
matter
what
he
says
my
dear
she
interposed
do
make
him
drop
the
subject
he
s
talking
very
wild
i
m
going
down
to
see
what
poppa
means
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
flat
at
the
door
she
paused
a
moment
to
add
mutely
by
mere
facial
force
now
just
wipe
him
out
mind
it
was
the
same
injunction
she
had
launched
at
her
from
afar
that
day
a
year
before
when
they
all
dined
at
and
she
could
remember
how
effective
it
had
then
been
the
next
moment
she
flirted
out
as
soon
as
she
had
gone
flack
moved
nearer
to
francie
now
look
here
you
re
not
going
back
on
me
are
you
going
back
on
you
what
do
you
mean
ain
t
we
together
in
this
thing
why
sure
we
re
close
together
miss
francie
together
together
francie
repeated
with
charming
wan
but
not
at
all
tender
eyes
on
him
don
t
you
remember
what
i
said
to
you
just
as
straight
as
my
course
always
is
before
we
went
up
there
before
our
lovely
drive
i
stated
to
you
that
i
felt
that
i
always
feel
my
great
hearty
hungry
public
behind
oh
yes
i
understood
it
was
all
for
you
to
work
it
up
i
told
them
so
i
never
denied
it
francie
brought
forth
you
told
them
so
when
they
were
all
crying
and
going
on
i
told
them
i
knew
it
i
told
them
i
gave
you
the
tip
as
you
call
she
felt
flack
fix
her
all
alarmingly
as
she
spoke
these
words
then
he
was
still
nearer
to
her
he
had
taken
her
hand
ah
you
re
too
sweet
she
disengaged
her
hand
and
in
the
effort
she
sprang
up
but
he
rising
too
seemed
to
press
always
nearer
she
had
a
sense
it
was
disagreeable
that
he
was
demonstrative
so
that
she
retreated
a
little
before
him
they
were
all
there
roaring
and
raging
trying
to
make
you
believe
you
had
outraged
them
all
but
young
probert
certainly
they
don
t
like
it
she
said
at
her
distance
the
cowards
george
flack
after
a
moment
remarked
and
where
was
young
probert
he
then
demanded
he
was
away
i
ve
told
you
in
ah
yes
your
father
told
me
but
now
he
s
back
doesn
t
he
like
it
either
i
don
t
know
flack
francie
answered
with
impatience
well
i
do
then
he
s
a
coward
too
he
ll
do
what
his
poppa
tells
him
and
the
countess
and
the
duchess
and
his
french
from
whom
he
takes
lessons
he
ll
just
back
down
he
ll
give
you
i
can
t
talk
with
you
about
that
said
francie
why
not
why
is
he
such
a
sacred
subject
when
we
are
together
you
can
t
alter
that
her
visitor
insisted
it
was
too
lovely
your
standing
up
for
me
your
not
denying
me
you
put
in
things
i
never
said
it
seems
to
me
it
was
very
different
she
freely
contended
everything
is
different
when
it
s
printed
what
else
would
be
the
good
of
the
papers
besides
it
wasn
t
i
it
was
a
lady
who
helps
me
here
you
ve
heard
me
speak
of
her
miss
topping
she
wants
so
much
to
know
you
she
wants
to
talk
with
and
will
she
publish
that
francie
asked
with
unstudied
effect
flack
stared
a
moment
lord
how
they
ve
worked
on
you
and
do
you
think
it
s
bad
do
i
think
what
s
bad
why
the
letter
we
re
talking
well
i
didn
t
see
the
point
of
so
he
waited
a
little
interestedly
do
you
think
i
took
any
advantage
she
made
no
answer
at
first
but
after
a
moment
said
in
a
tone
he
had
never
heard
from
her
why
do
you
come
here
this
way
why
do
you
ask
me
such
questions
he
hesitated
after
which
he
broke
out
because
i
love
you
don
t
you
know
that
oh
please
don
t
she
almost
moaned
turning
away
but
he
was
launched
now
and
he
let
himself
go
why
won
t
you
understand
it
why
won
t
you
understand
the
rest
don
t
you
see
how
it
has
worked
round
the
heartless
brutes
they
ve
turned
into
and
the
way
our
life
yours
and
mine
is
bound
to
be
the
same
don
t
you
see
the
damned
sneaking
scorn
with
which
they
treat
you
and
that
only
want
to
do
anything
in
the
world
for
you
francie
s
white
face
very
quiet
now
let
all
this
pass
without
a
sign
of
satisfaction
her
only
response
was
presently
to
say
why
did
you
ask
me
so
many
questions
that
day
because
i
always
ask
questions
it
s
my
nature
and
my
business
to
ask
them
haven
t
you
always
seen
me
ask
you
and
ask
every
one
all
i
could
don
t
you
know
they
re
the
very
foundation
of
my
work
i
thought
you
sympathised
with
my
work
so
much
you
used
to
tell
me
you
well
i
did
she
allowed
you
put
it
in
the
dead
past
i
see
you
don
t
then
any
more
if
this
remark
was
on
her
visitor
s
part
the
sign
of
a
rare
assurance
the
girl
s
cold
mildness
was
still
unruffled
by
it
she
considered
she
even
smiled
then
she
replied
oh
yes
i
do
only
not
so
they
have
worked
on
you
but
i
should
have
thought
they
d
have
disgusted
you
i
don
t
care
even
a
little
sympathy
will
do
whatever
you
ve
got
he
paused
looking
at
her
but
it
was
a
speech
she
had
nothing
for
so
he
went
on
there
was
no
obligation
for
you
to
answer
my
questions
you
might
have
shut
me
up
that
day
with
a
really
she
asked
with
all
her
grave
good
faith
in
her
face
i
thought
i
had
to
for
fear
i
should
appear
ungrateful
why
to
you
after
what
you
had
done
don
t
you
remember
that
it
was
you
who
introduced
us
and
she
paused
with
a
fatigued
delicacy
not
to
those
snobs
who
are
screaming
like
frightened
peacocks
i
beg
your
pardon
i
haven
t
that
on
my
conscience
flack
quite
grandly
declared
well
you
introduced
us
to
waterlow
and
he
introduced
us
to
to
his
friends
she
explained
colouring
as
if
it
were
a
fault
for
the
inexactness
caused
by
her
magnanimity
that
s
why
i
thought
i
ought
to
tell
you
what
you
d
why
do
you
suppose
if
i
d
known
where
that
first
visit
of
ours
to
waterlow
was
going
to
bring
you
out
i
d
have
taken
you
within
fifty
miles
he
stopped
suddenly
then
in
another
tone
jerusalem
there
s
no
one
like
you
and
you
told
them
it
was
all
you
never
mind
what
i
told
miss
francie
said
george
flack
if
you
ll
marry
me
i
ll
never
ask
a
question
again
i
ll
go
into
some
other
then
you
didn
t
do
it
on
purpose
francie
asked
on
purpose
to
get
me
into
a
quarrel
with
them
so
that
i
might
be
free
well
of
all
the
blamed
ideas
the
young
man
gasped
your
pure
mind
never
gave
birth
to
that
it
was
your
sister
wasn
t
it
natural
it
should
occur
to
me
since
if
as
you
say
you
d
never
consciously
have
been
the
means
ah
but
i
was
the
means
flack
interrupted
we
must
go
after
all
by
what
did
well
i
thanked
you
when
i
drove
with
you
and
let
you
draw
me
out
so
we
re
square
aren
t
we
the
term
francie
used
was
a
colloquialism
generally
associated
with
levity
but
her
face
as
she
spoke
was
none
the
less
deeply
serious
serious
even
to
pain
we
re
square
he
repeated
i
don
t
think
you
ought
to
ask
for
anything
more
never
cried
george
flack
who
flushed
with
his
defeat
to
a
degree
that
spoke
strangely
of
his
hopes
something
in
the
way
she
repeated
her
goodbye
betrayed
her
impression
of
this
and
not
a
little
withal
that
so
much
confidence
left
her
unflattered
do
go
away
she
broke
out
well
i
ll
come
back
very
soon
and
he
took
up
his
hat
please
don
t
i
don
t
like
she
had
now
contrived
to
put
a
wide
space
between
them
oh
you
tormentress
he
groaned
he
went
toward
the
door
but
before
he
reached
it
turned
round
will
you
tell
me
this
anyway
are
you
going
to
marry
the
lot
after
this
do
you
want
to
put
that
in
the
paper
of
course
i
do
and
say
you
said
it
flack
held
up
his
head
they
stood
looking
at
each
other
across
the
large
room
well
then
i
ain
t
there
that
s
all
right
he
said
as
he
went
out
xiv
when
gaston
probert
came
that
evening
he
was
received
by
dosson
and
delia
and
when
he
asked
where
francie
might
be
was
told
by
the
latter
that
she
would
show
herself
in
half
an
hour
francie
had
instructed
her
sister
that
as
their
friend
would
have
first
of
all
information
to
give
their
father
about
the
business
he
had
transacted
in
america
he
wouldn
t
care
for
a
lot
of
women
in
the
room
when
delia
reported
this
speech
to
dosson
that
gentleman
protested
that
he
wasn
t
in
any
hurry
for
the
business
what
he
wanted
to
find
out
most
was
whether
probert
had
a
good
time
whether
he
had
liked
it
over
there
gaston
might
have
liked
it
but
he
didn
t
look
as
if
he
had
had
a
very
good
time
his
face
told
of
reverses
of
suffering
and
delia
declared
to
him
that
if
she
hadn
t
received
his
assurance
to
the
contrary
she
would
have
believed
he
was
right
down
sick
he
allowed
that
he
had
been
very
sick
at
sea
and
was
still
feeling
the
effect
of
it
but
insisted
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
him
now
he
sat
for
some
time
with
dosson
and
delia
and
never
once
alluded
to
the
cloud
that
hung
over
their
relations
the
girl
had
schooled
her
father
to
a
waiting
attitude
on
this
point
and
the
manner
in
which
she
had
descended
on
him
in
the
morning
after
flack
had
come
upstairs
was
a
lesson
he
wasn
t
likely
soon
to
forget
it
had
been
impressed
on
him
that
she
was
indeed
wiser
than
he
could
pretend
to
be
and
he
was
now
mindful
that
he
mustn
t
speak
of
the
piece
in
the
paper
unless
young
probert
should
speak
of
it
first
when
delia
rushed
down
to
him
in
the
court
she
began
by
asking
him
categorically
whom
he
had
wished
to
do
good
to
by
sending
flack
up
to
their
parlour
to
francie
or
to
her
why
the
way
they
felt
then
they
detested
his
very
name
to
flack
himself
why
he
had
simply
exposed
him
to
the
biggest
snub
he
had
ever
got
in
his
life
well
hanged
if
i
understand
poor
dosson
had
said
i
thought
you
liked
the
piece
you
think
it
s
so
queer
they
don
t
like
they
in
the
parlance
of
the
dossons
now
never
meant
anything
but
the
proberts
in
congress
assembled
i
don
t
think
anything
s
queer
but
you
delia
had
retorted
and
she
had
let
her
father
know
that
she
had
left
francie
in
the
very
act
of
handling
flack
is
that
so
the
old
gentleman
had
quavered
in
an
impotence
that
made
him
wince
with
a
sense
of
meanness
meanness
to
his
bold
initiator
of
so
many
parisian
hours
francie
s
visitor
came
down
a
few
minutes
later
and
passed
through
the
court
and
out
of
the
hotel
without
looking
at
them
dosson
had
been
going
to
call
after
him
but
delia
checked
him
with
a
violent
pinch
the
unsociable
manner
of
the
young
journalist
s
departure
deepened
dosson
s
dull
ache
over
the
mystery
of
things
i
think
this
may
be
said
to
have
been
the
only
incident
in
the
whole
business
that
gave
him
a
personal
pang
he
remembered
how
many
of
his
cigars
he
had
smoked
with
flack
and
how
universal
a
participant
he
had
made
him
this
haughtiness
struck
him
as
the
failure
of
friendship
not
the
publication
of
details
about
the
proberts
interwoven
with
dosson
s
nature
was
the
view
that
if
these
people
had
done
bad
things
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
and
he
couldn
t
pity
them
and
that
if
they
hadn
t
done
them
there
was
no
need
of
making
such
a
rumpus
about
other
people
s
knowing
it
was
therefore
in
spite
of
the
young
man
s
rough
exit
still
in
the
tone
of
american
condonation
that
he
had
observed
to
delia
he
says
that
s
what
they
like
over
there
and
that
it
stands
to
reason
that
if
you
start
a
paper
you
ve
got
to
give
them
what
they
like
if
you
want
the
people
with
you
you
ve
got
to
be
with
the
well
there
are
a
good
many
people
in
the
world
i
don
t
think
the
proberts
are
with
us
oh
he
doesn
t
mean
them
said
dosson
well
i
do
cried
delia
at
one
of
the
ormolu
tables
near
a
lamp
with
a
pink
shade
gaston
insisted
on
making
at
least
a
partial
statement
he
didn
t
say
that
he
might
never
have
another
chance
but
delia
felt
with
despair
that
this
idea
was
in
his
mind
he
was
very
gentle
very
polite
but
distinctly
cold
she
thought
he
was
intensely
depressed
and
for
half
an
hour
uttered
not
the
least
little
pleasantry
there
was
no
particular
occasion
for
that
when
he
talked
about
preferred
bonds
with
her
father
this
was
a
language
delia
couldn
t
translate
though
she
had
heard
it
from
childhood
he
had
a
great
many
papers
to
show
dosson
records
of
the
mission
of
which
he
had
acquitted
himself
but
dosson
pushed
them
into
the
drawer
of
the
ormolu
table
with
the
remark
that
he
guessed
they
were
all
right
now
after
the
fact
he
appeared
to
attach
but
little
importance
to
gaston
s
achievements
an
attitude
which
delia
perceived
to
be
slightly
disconcerting
to
their
visitor
delia
understood
it
she
had
an
instinctive
sense
that
her
father
knew
a
great
deal
more
than
gaston
could
tell
him
even
about
the
work
he
had
committed
to
him
and
also
that
there
was
in
such
punctual
settlements
an
eagerness
a
literalism
totally
foreign
to
dosson
s
domestic
habits
and
to
which
he
would
even
have
imputed
a
certain
pettifogging
provinciality
treatable
however
with
dry
humour
if
gaston
had
cooled
off
he
wanted
at
least
to
be
able
to
say
that
he
had
rendered
them
services
in
america
but
now
her
father
for
the
moment
at
least
scarcely
appeared
to
think
his
services
worth
speaking
of
an
incident
that
left
him
with
more
of
the
responsibility
for
his
cooling
what
dosson
wanted
to
know
was
how
everything
had
struck
him
over
there
especially
the
pickett
building
and
the
and
niagara
and
the
hotels
he
had
instructed
him
to
go
to
giving
him
an
introduction
in
two
or
three
cases
to
the
gentleman
in
charge
of
the
office
it
was
in
relation
to
these
themes
that
gaston
was
guilty
of
a
want
of
spring
as
the
girl
phrased
it
to
herself
that
he
could
produce
no
appreciative
expression
he
declared
however
repeatedly
that
it
was
a
most
extraordinary
country
most
extraordinary
and
far
beyond
anything
he
had
had
any
conception
of
of
course
i
didn
t
like
everything
he
said
any
more
than
i
like
everything
well
what
didn
t
you
like
dosson
enquired
at
this
after
a
short
silence
gaston
probert
made
his
choice
well
the
light
for
the
light
the
electric
no
the
solar
i
thought
it
rather
hard
too
much
like
the
scratching
of
a
as
dosson
hereupon
looked
vague
and
rather
as
if
the
reference
were
to
some
enterprise
a
great
lamp
company
of
which
he
had
not
heard
conveying
a
suggestion
that
he
was
perhaps
staying
away
too
long
gaston
immediately
added
i
really
think
francie
might
come
in
i
wrote
to
her
that
i
wanted
particularly
to
see
i
ll
go
and
call
her
i
ll
make
her
come
said
delia
at
the
door
she
left
her
companions
together
and
gaston
returned
to
the
subject
of
munster
dosson
s
former
partner
to
whom
he
had
taken
a
letter
and
who
had
shown
him
every
sort
of
civility
dosson
was
pleased
at
this
nevertheless
he
broke
out
suddenly
look
here
you
know
if
you
ve
got
anything
to
say
that
you
don
t
think
very
acceptable
you
had
better
say
it
to
gaston
changed
colour
but
his
reply
was
checked
by
delia
s
quick
return
she
brought
the
news
that
her
sister
would
be
obliged
if
he
would
go
into
the
little
he
would
find
her
there
she
had
something
for
his
ear
that
she
could
mention
only
in
private
it
was
very
comfortable
there
was
a
lamp
and
a
fire
well
i
guess
she
can
take
care
of
herself
dosson
at
this
commented
with
a
laugh
what
does
she
want
to
say
to
him
he
asked
when
gaston
had
passed
out
gracious
knows
she
won
t
tell
me
but
it
s
too
flat
at
his
age
to
live
in
such
in
such
terror
why
of
your
father
you
ve
got
to
how
to
choose
why
if
there
s
a
person
you
like
and
he
doesn
t
you
mean
you
can
t
choose
your
father
said
dosson
thoughtfully
of
course
you
can
well
then
please
don
t
like
any
one
but
perhaps
should
like
him
he
added
faithful
to
his
easier
philosophy
i
guess
you
d
have
to
said
delia
in
the
small
when
gaston
went
in
francie
was
standing
by
the
empty
table
and
as
soon
as
she
saw
him
she
began
you
can
t
say
i
didn
t
tell
you
i
should
do
something
i
did
nothing
else
from
the
first
i
mean
but
tell
you
so
you
were
warned
again
and
again
you
knew
what
to
ah
don
t
say
that
again
if
you
knew
how
it
acts
on
my
nerves
the
young
man
groaned
you
speak
as
if
you
had
done
it
on
purpose
to
carry
out
your
absurd
well
what
does
it
matter
when
it
s
all
over
it
s
not
all
over
would
to
god
it
were
the
girl
stared
don
t
you
know
what
i
sent
for
you
to
come
in
here
for
to
bid
you
he
held
her
an
instant
as
if
in
unbelievable
view
and
then
francie
what
on
earth
has
got
into
you
he
broke
out
what
deviltry
what
poison
it
would
have
been
strange
and
sad
to
an
observer
the
opposition
of
these
young
figures
so
fresh
so
candid
so
meant
for
confidence
but
now
standing
apart
and
looking
at
each
other
in
a
wan
defiance
that
hardened
their
faces
don
t
they
despise
me
don
t
they
hate
me
you
do
yourself
certainly
you
ll
be
glad
for
me
to
break
off
and
spare
you
decisions
and
troubles
impossible
to
i
don
t
understand
it
s
like
some
hideous
dream
gaston
probert
cried
you
act
as
if
you
were
doing
something
for
a
wager
and
you
make
it
worse
by
your
talk
i
don
t
believe
it
i
don
t
believe
a
word
of
what
don
t
you
believe
she
asked
that
you
told
him
that
you
told
him
knowingly
if
you
ll
take
that
back
it
s
too
monstrous
if
you
ll
deny
it
and
give
me
your
assurance
that
you
were
practised
upon
and
surprised
everything
can
still
be
do
you
want
me
to
lie
asked
francie
dosson
i
thought
you
d
like
pleasant
oh
francie
francie
moaned
the
wretched
youth
with
tears
in
his
eyes
what
can
be
arranged
what
do
you
mean
by
everything
she
went
on
why
they
ll
accept
it
they
ll
ask
for
nothing
more
it
s
your
participation
they
can
t
they
can
t
why
do
you
talk
to
me
of
them
i
m
not
engaged
to
them
she
said
with
a
shrill
little
laugh
oh
francie
am
and
it
s
they
who
are
buried
beneath
that
filthy
rubbish
she
flushed
at
this
characterisation
of
flack
s
epistle
but
returned
as
with
more
gravity
i
m
very
sorry
very
sorry
indeed
but
evidently
i
m
not
he
looked
at
her
helpless
and
bitter
it
s
not
the
newspapers
in
your
country
that
would
have
made
you
so
lord
they
re
too
incredible
and
the
ladies
have
them
on
their
you
told
me
we
couldn
t
here
that
the
paris
ones
are
too
bad
said
francie
bad
they
are
god
knows
but
they
ve
never
published
anything
like
that
poured
forth
such
a
flood
of
impudence
on
decent
quiet
people
who
only
want
to
be
left
francie
sank
to
a
chair
by
the
table
as
if
she
were
too
tired
to
stand
longer
and
with
her
arms
spread
out
on
the
lamplit
plush
she
looked
up
at
him
was
it
there
you
saw
it
he
was
on
his
feet
opposite
and
she
made
at
this
moment
the
odd
reflexion
that
she
had
never
realised
he
had
such
fine
lovely
uplifted
eyebrows
yes
a
few
days
before
i
sailed
i
hated
them
from
the
moment
i
got
there
i
looked
at
them
very
little
but
that
was
a
chance
i
opened
the
paper
in
the
hall
of
an
hotel
there
was
a
big
marble
floor
and
spittoons
and
my
eyes
fell
on
that
horror
it
made
me
did
you
think
it
was
me
she
patiently
gaped
about
as
soon
as
i
supposed
it
was
my
father
but
i
was
too
mystified
too
then
why
didn
t
you
write
to
me
if
you
didn
t
think
it
was
me
write
to
you
i
wrote
to
you
every
three
days
he
cried
not
after
well
i
may
have
omitted
a
post
at
the
last
i
thought
it
might
be
delia
gaston
added
in
a
moment
oh
she
didn
t
want
me
to
do
it
the
day
i
went
with
him
the
day
i
told
him
she
tried
to
prevent
me
francie
insisted
would
to
god
then
she
had
he
wailed
haven
t
you
told
them
she
s
delicate
too
she
asked
in
her
strange
tone
he
made
no
answer
to
this
he
only
continued
what
power
in
heaven
s
name
has
he
got
over
you
what
spell
has
he
worked
he
s
a
gay
old
friend
he
helped
us
ever
so
much
when
we
were
first
in
but
my
dearest
child
what
gaieties
what
friends
what
a
man
to
know
if
we
hadn
t
known
him
we
shouldn
t
have
known
you
remember
it
was
flack
who
brought
us
that
day
to
waterlow
oh
you
d
have
come
some
other
way
said
gaston
who
made
nothing
of
that
not
in
the
least
we
knew
nothing
about
any
other
way
he
helped
us
in
everything
he
showed
us
everything
that
was
why
i
told
him
when
he
asked
me
i
liked
him
for
what
he
had
gaston
who
had
now
also
seated
himself
listened
to
this
attentively
i
see
it
was
a
kind
of
oh
a
kind
she
desperately
smiled
he
remained
a
little
with
his
eyes
on
her
face
was
it
for
me
of
course
it
was
for
ah
how
strange
you
are
he
cried
with
tenderness
such
contradictions
on
s
y
perd
i
wish
you
d
say
that
to
them
that
way
everything
would
be
never
never
said
the
girl
i
ve
wronged
them
and
nothing
will
ever
be
the
same
again
it
was
fatal
if
i
felt
as
they
do
i
too
would
loathe
the
person
who
should
have
done
such
a
thing
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
so
bad
the
thing
in
the
paper
but
you
know
best
you
must
go
back
to
them
you
know
best
she
repeated
they
were
the
last
the
last
people
in
france
to
do
it
to
the
sense
of
desecration
of
pollution
you
see
he
explained
as
if
for
conscience
oh
you
needn
t
tell
me
i
saw
them
all
there
she
answered
it
must
have
been
a
dreadful
scene
but
you
didn
t
brave
them
did
you
brave
them
what
are
you
talking
about
to
you
that
idea
s
incredible
she
then
hopelessly
sighed
but
he
wouldn
t
have
this
no
no
i
can
imagine
he
clearly
had
some
vision
of
independence
though
he
looked
awful
about
it
but
this
isn
t
a
case
hey
she
demanded
well
then
go
back
to
them
go
back
she
repeated
at
this
he
himself
across
the
table
to
seize
her
hands
but
she
drew
away
and
as
he
came
nearer
pushed
her
chair
back
springing
up
you
know
you
didn
t
come
here
to
tell
me
you
re
ready
to
give
them
to
give
them
up
he
only
echoed
it
with
all
his
woe
at
first
i
ve
been
battling
with
them
till
i
m
ready
to
drop
you
don
t
know
how
they
feel
how
they
must
oh
yes
i
do
all
this
has
made
me
older
every
it
has
made
you
so
extraordinarily
more
beautiful
said
gaston
probert
i
don
t
care
nothing
will
induce
me
to
consent
to
any
some
sacrifice
there
must
be
give
me
time
give
me
time
i
ll
manage
it
i
only
wish
they
hadn
t
seen
you
there
in
the
in
the
bois
that
marguerite
hadn
t
seen
you
with
that
lying
blackguard
that
s
the
image
they
can
t
get
well
it
was
as
if
it
had
been
the
thing
she
had
got
herself
most
prepared
for
so
that
she
must
speak
accordingly
i
see
you
can
t
either
gaston
anyhow
i
was
there
and
i
felt
it
all
right
that
s
all
i
can
say
you
must
take
me
as
i
am
said
francie
dosson
don
t
don
t
you
infuriate
me
he
pleaded
frowning
she
had
seemed
to
soften
but
she
was
in
a
sudden
flame
again
of
course
i
do
and
i
shall
do
it
again
we
re
too
terribly
different
everything
makes
you
so
you
can
t
give
them
up
ever
ever
that
s
all
i
wanted
to
tell
i
ll
go
and
throttle
him
the
young
man
almost
howled
very
well
go
she
had
stepped
quickly
to
the
door
and
had
already
opened
it
vanishing
as
she
had
done
the
other
time
francie
francie
he
supplicated
following
her
into
the
passage
the
door
was
not
the
one
that
led
to
the
salon
it
communicated
with
the
other
apartments
the
girl
had
plunged
into
these
he
already
heard
her
push
a
sharp
bolt
presently
he
went
away
without
taking
leave
of
dosson
and
delia
why
he
acts
just
like
flack
said
the
old
man
when
they
discovered
that
the
interview
in
the
had
come
to
an
end
the
next
day
was
a
bad
one
for
charles
waterlow
his
work
in
the
avenue
de
villiers
being
terribly
interrupted
gaston
probert
invited
himself
to
breakfast
at
noon
and
remained
till
the
time
at
which
the
artist
usually
went
out
an
extravagance
partly
justified
by
the
previous
separation
of
several
weeks
during
these
three
or
four
hours
gaston
walked
up
and
down
the
studio
while
waterlow
either
sat
or
stood
before
his
easel
he
put
his
host
vastly
out
and
acted
on
his
nerves
but
this
easy
genius
was
patient
with
him
by
reason
of
much
pity
feeling
the
occasion
indeed
more
of
a
crisis
in
the
history
of
the
troubled
youth
than
the
settlement
of
one
question
would
make
it
waterlow
s
compassion
was
slightly
tinged
with
contempt
for
there
was
being
settled
above
all
it
seemed
to
him
and
alas
in
the
wrong
sense
the
question
of
his
poor
friend
s
character
gaston
was
in
a
fever
he
broke
out
into
passionate
pleas
he
relapsed
into
gloomy
silences
he
roamed
about
continually
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
his
hair
in
a
tangle
he
could
take
neither
a
decision
nor
a
momentary
rest
it
struck
his
companion
more
than
ever
before
that
he
was
after
all
essentially
a
foreigner
he
had
the
foreign
sensibility
the
sentimental
candour
the
need
for
sympathy
the
communicative
despair
a
true
young
would
have
buttoned
himself
up
in
his
embarrassment
and
been
dry
and
awkward
and
capable
and
however
conscious
of
a
pressure
unconscious
of
a
drama
whereas
gaston
was
effusive
and
appealing
and
ridiculous
and
graceful
natural
above
all
and
egotistical
indeed
a
true
young
wouldn
t
have
known
the
particular
acuteness
of
such
a
quandary
for
he
wouldn
t
have
parted
to
such
an
extent
with
his
freedom
of
spirit
it
was
the
fact
of
this
surrender
on
his
visitor
s
part
that
excited
waterlow
s
secret
scorn
family
feeling
was
all
very
well
but
to
see
it
triumph
as
a
superstition
calling
for
the
made
him
feel
he
would
as
soon
be
a
blackamoor
on
his
knees
before
a
fetish
he
now
measured
for
the
first
time
the
root
it
had
taken
in
gaston
s
nature
to
act
like
a
man
the
hope
of
the
proberts
must
pull
up
the
root
even
if
the
operation
should
be
terribly
painful
should
be
attended
with
cries
and
tears
and
contortions
with
baffling
scruples
and
a
sense
of
sacrilege
the
sense
of
siding
with
strangers
against
his
own
flesh
and
blood
now
and
again
he
broke
out
and
if
you
should
see
her
as
she
looks
just
now
she
s
too
lovely
too
touching
you
d
see
how
right
i
was
originally
when
i
found
her
such
a
revelation
of
that
rare
type
the
french
renaissance
you
know
the
one
we
talked
but
he
reverted
with
at
least
equal
frequency
to
the
oppression
he
seemed
unable
to
throw
off
the
idea
of
something
done
of
cruel
purpose
and
malice
with
a
refinement
of
outrage
such
an
accident
to
them
of
all
people
on
earth
the
very
last
the
least
thinkable
those
who
he
verily
believed
would
feel
it
more
than
any
family
in
the
world
when
waterlow
asked
what
made
them
of
so
exceptionally
fine
a
fibre
he
could
only
answer
that
they
just
happened
to
be
not
enviably
if
one
would
it
was
his
father
s
influence
and
example
his
very
genius
the
worship
of
privacy
and
good
manners
a
hatred
of
all
the
new
familiarities
and
profanations
the
artist
sought
to
know
further
at
last
and
rather
wearily
what
in
two
words
was
the
practical
question
his
friend
desired
he
should
consider
whether
he
should
be
justified
in
throwing
the
girl
over
was
that
the
issue
gracious
goodness
no
for
what
sort
of
sneak
do
you
take
me
she
made
a
mistake
but
any
innocent
young
creature
might
do
that
it
s
whether
it
strikes
you
i
should
be
justified
in
throwing
them
it
depends
upon
the
sense
you
attach
to
i
mean
should
i
be
miserably
unhappy
would
it
be
in
their
power
to
make
me
so
to
try
certainly
if
they
re
capable
of
anything
so
nasty
the
only
fair
play
for
them
is
to
let
you
alone
waterlow
wound
up
ah
they
won
t
do
that
they
like
me
too
much
gaston
ingenuously
cried
it
s
an
odd
way
of
liking
the
best
way
to
show
their
love
will
be
to
let
you
marry
where
your
affections
and
so
many
other
charming
things
are
certainly
only
they
question
the
charming
things
they
feel
she
represents
poor
little
dear
such
dangers
such
vulgarities
such
possibilities
of
doing
other
dreadful
things
that
it
s
upon
them
i
mean
on
those
things
my
happiness
would
be
well
the
elder
man
rather
dryly
said
if
you
yourself
have
no
secrets
for
persuading
them
of
the
contrary
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
teach
you
yes
i
ought
to
do
it
myself
gaston
allowed
in
the
candour
of
his
meditations
then
he
went
on
in
his
torment
of
hesitation
they
never
believed
in
her
from
the
first
my
father
was
perfectly
definite
about
it
at
heart
they
never
accepted
her
they
only
pretended
to
do
so
because
i
guaranteed
her
instincts
that
s
what
i
did
heaven
help
me
and
that
she
was
incapable
of
doing
a
thing
that
could
ever
displease
them
then
no
sooner
was
my
back
turned
than
she
perpetrated
that
that
was
your
folly
waterlow
remarked
painting
away
my
folly
to
turn
my
back
no
no
to
my
dear
fellow
wouldn
t
you
and
gaston
stared
never
in
the
you
d
have
thought
her
capable
capabilissima
and
i
shouldn
t
have
do
you
think
her
then
capable
of
breaking
out
again
in
some
new
way
that
s
as
bad
i
shouldn
t
care
if
she
was
that
s
the
least
of
all
the
least
ah
don
t
you
see
wretched
youth
cried
the
artist
pausing
from
his
work
and
looking
up
don
t
you
see
that
the
question
of
her
possibilities
is
as
nothing
compared
to
that
of
yours
she
s
the
sweetest
young
thing
i
ever
saw
but
even
if
she
happened
not
to
be
i
should
still
urge
you
to
marry
her
in
simple
gaston
kept
echoing
in
to
save
from
destruction
the
last
scrap
of
your
independence
that
s
a
much
more
important
matter
even
than
not
treating
her
shabbily
they
re
doing
their
best
to
kill
you
morally
to
render
you
incapable
of
individual
gaston
was
immensely
struck
they
are
they
are
he
declared
with
enthusiasm
well
then
if
you
believe
it
for
heaven
s
sake
go
and
marry
her
waterlow
threw
down
his
implements
and
added
and
come
out
of
this
into
the
gaston
however
was
planted
in
his
path
on
the
way
to
the
door
and
if
she
goes
again
and
does
the
very
same
the
very
same
waterlow
thought
i
mean
something
else
as
barbarous
and
as
hard
to
well
said
waterlow
you
ll
at
least
have
got
rid
of
your
yes
if
she
lets
me
in
again
i
shall
be
glad
they
re
not
there
they
re
right
pourtant
they
re
right
gaston
went
on
passing
out
of
the
studio
with
his
friend
they
re
right
it
was
unimaginable
that
she
yes
thank
heaven
it
was
the
finger
of
providence
providence
taking
you
off
your
guard
to
give
you
your
this
was
ingenious
but
though
he
could
glow
for
a
moment
in
response
to
it
francie
s
lover
if
lover
he
may
in
his
so
infirm
aspect
be
called
looked
as
if
he
mistrusted
it
thought
it
slightly
sophistical
what
really
shook
him
however
was
his
companion
s
saying
to
him
in
the
vestibule
when
they
had
taken
their
hats
and
sticks
and
were
on
the
point
of
going
out
lord
man
how
can
you
be
so
impenetrably
dense
don
t
you
see
that
she
s
really
of
the
softest
finest
material
that
breathes
that
she
s
a
perfect
flower
of
plasticity
that
everything
you
may
have
an
apprehension
about
will
drop
away
from
her
like
the
dead
leaves
from
a
rose
and
that
you
may
make
of
her
any
perfect
and
enchanting
thing
you
yourself
have
the
wit
to
conceive
ah
my
dear
friend
and
poor
gaston
with
another
of
his
revulsions
panted
for
gratitude
the
limit
will
be
yours
not
hers
waterlow
added
no
no
i
ve
done
with
limits
his
friend
ecstatically
cried
that
evening
at
ten
o
clock
gaston
presented
himself
at
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
and
requested
the
german
waiter
to
introduce
him
into
the
attached
to
dosson
s
apartments
and
then
go
and
tell
miss
francina
he
awaited
her
there
oh
you
ll
be
better
there
than
in
the
zalon
they
ve
villed
it
with
their
luccatch
said
the
man
who
always
addressed
him
in
an
intention
of
english
and
wasn
t
ignorant
of
the
tie
that
united
the
visitor
to
the
amiable
american
family
or
perhaps
even
of
the
modifications
it
had
lately
undergone
with
their
luggage
they
leave
morning
ach
i
don
t
think
they
themselves
know
for
where
please
then
say
to
miss
francina
that
i
ve
called
on
the
most
urgent
business
and
am
extraordinarily
the
special
ardour
possessing
gaston
at
that
moment
belonged
to
the
order
of
the
communicative
but
perhaps
the
vividness
with
which
the
waiter
placed
this
exhibition
of
it
before
the
young
lady
is
better
explained
by
the
fact
that
her
lover
slipped
a
piece
into
his
hand
she
at
any
rate
entered
his
place
of
patience
sooner
than
gaston
had
ventured
to
hope
though
she
corrected
her
promptitude
a
little
by
stopping
short
and
drawing
back
when
she
saw
how
pale
he
was
and
how
he
looked
as
if
he
had
been
crying
i
ve
chosen
i
ve
chosen
he
said
expressively
smiling
at
her
in
denial
of
these
indications
you
ve
chosen
i
ve
had
to
give
them
up
but
i
like
it
so
better
than
having
to
give
you
up
i
took
you
first
with
their
assent
that
was
well
enough
it
was
worth
trying
for
but
now
i
take
you
without
it
we
can
live
that
way
ah
i
m
not
worth
it
you
give
up
too
much
francie
returned
we
re
going
away
it
s
all
she
averted
herself
quickly
as
if
to
carry
out
her
meaning
but
he
caught
her
more
quickly
still
and
held
her
held
her
fast
and
long
she
had
only
freed
herself
when
her
father
and
sister
broke
in
from
the
salon
attracted
apparently
by
the
audible
commotion
oh
i
thought
you
had
at
least
knocked
over
the
lamp
delia
exclaimed
you
must
take
me
with
you
if
you
re
going
away
dosson
gaston
said
i
ll
start
whenever
you
all
right
where
shall
we
go
that
amiable
man
asked
hadn
t
you
decided
that
well
the
girls
said
they
d
tell
we
were
going
home
francie
brought
out
no
we
weren
t
not
a
wee
mite
delia
professed
oh
not
there
gaston
murmured
with
a
look
of
anguish
at
francie
well
when
you
ve
fixed
it
you
can
take
the
tickets
dosson
observed
with
detachment
to
some
place
where
there
are
no
newspapers
darling
gaston
went
on
i
guess
you
ll
have
hard
work
to
find
one
dosson
pursued
dear
me
we
needn
t
read
them
any
more
we
wouldn
t
have
read
that
one
if
your
family
hadn
t
forced
us
delia
said
to
her
prospective
well
i
shall
never
be
forced
i
shall
never
again
in
my
life
look
at
one
he
very
gravely
declared
you
ll
see
sir
you
ll
have
to
dosson
cheerfully
persisted
no
you
ll
tell
us
francie
had
kept
her
eyes
on
the
ground
the
others
were
all
now
rather
unnaturally
smiling
won
t
they
forgive
me
ever
she
asked
looking
up
yes
perfectly
if
you
can
persuade
me
not
to
stick
to
you
but
in
that
case
what
good
will
their
forgiveness
do
you
well
perhaps
it
s
better
to
pay
for
it
the
girl
went
on
to
pay
for
it
by
suffering
something
for
it
was
dreadful
she
solemnly
gloomily
said
oh
for
all
you
ll
suffer
gaston
protested
shining
down
on
her
it
was
for
you
only
for
you
as
i
told
you
francie
returned
yes
don
t
tell
me
again
i
don
t
like
that
explanation
i
ought
to
let
you
know
that
my
father
now
declines
to
do
anything
for
me
the
young
man
added
to
dosson
to
do
anything
for
you
to
make
me
any
well
that
makes
me
feel
better
we
don
t
want
your
father
s
money
you
know
this
more
soothable
parent
said
with
his
mild
sturdiness
there
ll
be
enough
for
all
especially
if
we
economise
in
newspapers
delia
carried
it
elegantly
off
well
i
don
t
know
after
all
the
reverberator
came
for
nothing
her
father
as
gaily
returned
don
t
you
be
afraid
he
ll
ever
send
it
now
she
shouted
in
her
return
of
confidence
i
m
very
sorry
because
they
were
all
lovely
francie
went
on
to
gaston
with
sad
eyes
let
us
wait
to
say
that
till
they
come
back
to
us
he
answered
somewhat
sententiously
he
really
cared
little
at
this
moment
whether
his
relatives
were
lovely
or
not
i
m
sure
you
won
t
have
to
wait
long
delia
remarked
with
the
same
cheerfulness
till
they
come
back
dosson
repeated
ah
they
can
t
come
back
now
sir
we
won
t
take
them
in
the
words
fell
from
his
lips
with
a
fine
unexpected
austerity
which
imposed
itself
producing
a
momentary
silence
and
it
is
a
sign
of
gaston
s
complete
emancipation
that
he
didn
t
in
his
heart
resent
this
image
of
eventual
favours
denied
his
race
the
resentment
was
rather
delia
s
but
she
kept
it
to
herself
for
she
was
capable
of
reflecting
with
complacency
that
the
key
of
the
house
would
after
all
be
hers
so
that
she
could
open
the
door
for
the
proberts
if
the
proberts
should
knock
now
that
her
sister
s
marriage
was
really
to
take
place
her
consciousness
that
the
american
people
would
have
been
resoundingly
told
so
was
still
more
agreeable
the
party
left
the
hotel
de
l
univers
et
de
cheltenham
on
the
morrow
but
it
appeared
to
the
german
waiter
as
he
accepted
another
piece
from
the
happy
and
now
reckless
gaston
that
they
were
even
yet
not
at
all
clear
as
to
where
they
were
going
