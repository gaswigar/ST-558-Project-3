secret
marcia
brett
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
tell
you
what
that
you
had
a
secret
two
whole
months
and
never
told
me
about
it
yet
and
i
your
friend
i
was
waiting
till
you
came
to
the
city
janet
i
wanted
to
you
i
did
want
to
it
well
i
been
in
the
city
twelve
hours
and
you
never
said
a
word
about
it
till
just
now
but
janet
we
been
ever
since
you
arrived
you
very
well
tell
secrets
when
you
you
know
well
you
might
have
given
me
a
hint
about
it
long
ago
you
know
solemnly
promised
never
to
have
any
secrets
from
each
other
and
yet
you
had
one
whole
no
jan
i
have
had
it
quite
as
long
as
that
honest
it
begin
till
quite
a
while
after
i
came
in
fact
not
till
about
three
or
four
weeks
ago
tell
me
all
about
it
right
away
then
and
perhaps
i
forgive
you
the
two
girls
cuddled
up
close
to
each
other
on
the
low
couch
by
the
open
window
and
lowered
their
voices
to
a
whisper
through
the
warm
darkness
of
the
june
night
came
the
hum
of
a
great
city
a
subdued
murmurous
sound
strangely
unfamiliar
to
one
of
the
girls
who
was
in
the
city
for
the
first
time
in
all
her
country
life
to
the
other
the
sound
had
some
time
since
become
an
accustomed
one
as
they
leaned
their
elbows
on
the
sill
and
chins
in
hand
stared
out
into
the
darkness
marcia
began
well
jan
i
might
as
well
commence
at
the
beginning
so
understand
how
it
all
happened
i
been
just
crazy
to
tell
you
but
i
not
good
at
and
there
such
a
lot
to
explain
that
i
thought
i
wait
till
your
visit
you
know
when
we
first
moved
to
this
apartment
last
april
from
back
in
northam
i
was
all
excitement
for
a
while
just
to
be
living
in
the
city
everything
was
different
really
i
acted
so
you
would
believe
it
i
used
to
run
down
to
the
front
door
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
just
to
push
the
bell
and
see
the
door
open
all
by
itself
it
seemed
like
something
in
a
and
for
the
longest
while
i
could
get
used
to
the
or
the
or
the
electric
lights
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
it
awfully
different
from
our
little
northam
now
is
it
yes
i
feel
just
that
way
this
minute
admitted
janet
and
then
too
went
on
marcia
there
were
all
the
things
outside
to
do
and
see
the
trolleys
and
stores
and
parks
and
museums
and
the
zoo
aunt
minerva
said
i
went
around
a
distracted
chicken
for
a
while
and
beside
that
we
used
to
have
the
greatest
fun
shopping
for
new
furniture
and
things
for
this
apartment
hardly
a
bit
of
that
big
old
furniture
we
brought
with
us
would
fit
into
it
these
rooms
are
so
much
smaller
than
the
ones
in
our
old
well
anyhow
for
a
while
i
was
too
busy
and
interested
and
excited
to
think
of
another
thing
yes
too
busy
to
even
write
to
interrupted
janet
i
had
about
one
letter
in
two
weeks
from
you
those
days
and
you
to
write
every
other
day
oh
well
never
mind
that
now
you
have
done
the
same
i
guess
if
you
do
let
me
go
on
i
never
get
to
the
after
a
while
though
i
got
used
to
all
the
new
things
and
i
seen
all
the
sights
and
aunt
minerva
had
finished
all
the
furnishing
except
the
curtains
and
draperies
she
at
that
yet
and
all
of
a
sudden
everything
fell
flat
i
had
begun
my
and
there
did
seem
to
be
a
thing
to
do
or
a
single
interest
in
life
the
truth
is
jan
i
was
frightfully
lonesome
for
here
marcia
felt
her
hand
squeezed
in
the
darkness
perhaps
you
do
realize
it
but
living
in
an
apartment
in
a
big
city
is
the
thing
you
do
know
your
neighbor
that
lives
right
across
the
hall
you
know
a
soul
in
the
house
and
as
far
as
i
can
see
you
not
likely
to
if
you
lived
here
fifty
years
nobody
calls
on
you
as
they
do
on
a
new
family
in
the
country
nobody
seems
to
care
a
rap
who
you
are
or
whether
you
live
or
die
or
anything
and
would
you
believe
it
janet
there
is
another
girl
in
this
whole
apartment
either
older
or
younger
than
myself
no
one
but
so
you
can
see
how
awfully
lonesome
i
been
and
as
aunt
minerva
had
decided
not
to
send
me
to
high
school
till
fall
i
did
have
a
chance
to
get
acquainted
with
any
one
of
my
own
age
actually
it
got
so
i
did
do
much
else
but
moon
around
and
mark
off
the
days
till
school
in
northam
closed
and
you
could
come
and
oh
i
glad
you
here
for
the
summer
is
it
gorgeous
she
hugged
her
chum
spasmodically
but
to
go
on
i
telling
you
all
this
so
you
can
see
what
led
up
to
my
doing
what
i
did
about
the
it
began
one
awfully
rainy
afternoon
last
month
i
been
for
a
walk
in
the
wet
just
for
exercise
and
when
i
came
in
aunt
minerva
was
out
shopping
i
had
a
new
book
to
read
nor
a
blessed
thing
to
do
so
i
sat
down
right
here
by
the
window
and
got
to
thinking
and
wondering
things
were
so
unevenly
divided
why
you
jan
should
have
a
mother
and
father
and
a
big
jolly
lot
of
brothers
and
sisters
and
i
should
be
just
all
alone
living
with
aunt
minerva
though
she
lovely
to
me
with
no
mother
and
a
father
away
nearly
all
the
time
on
his
ship
and
it
seemed
as
if
i
just
hated
this
apartment
with
its
little
rooms
like
cubbyholes
all
in
a
row
i
longed
to
be
back
in
northam
and
looking
out
of
the
window
i
even
thought
i
give
anything
to
live
in
that
big
rambling
dingy
old
place
next
door
beyond
the
brick
wall
for
at
least
one
could
go
up
and
down
to
the
different
rooms
and
then
if
you
believe
me
jan
as
i
stared
at
that
house
it
began
to
dawn
on
me
that
i
never
really
it
in
before
that
it
was
a
very
old
place
and
because
i
did
have
another
mortal
thing
to
do
i
just
sat
and
stared
at
it
as
if
i
never
seen
it
before
and
began
to
wonder
and
wonder
about
it
for
there
were
a
number
of
things
about
it
that
seemed
decidedly
what
it
like
anyway
questioned
janet
there
were
so
many
other
things
to
see
that
i
did
notice
it
at
all
and
it
so
dark
now
i
ca
see
a
thing
why
it
a
big
square
brick
house
and
it
terribly
in
need
of
paint
looks
as
if
it
had
had
a
coat
in
years
and
years
it
stands
back
from
the
street
in
a
sort
of
ragged
weedy
garden
and
there
a
high
brick
wall
around
the
whole
place
except
for
a
heavy
wooden
gate
at
the
front
covered
with
ironwork
that
gate
is
always
closed
a
stone
walk
runs
from
the
gate
to
the
front
door
back
at
the
rear
of
the
garden
is
an
old
brick
stable
that
looks
as
if
it
been
opened
or
used
in
years
you
see
all
this
yourself
janet
when
you
look
out
of
the
window
in
the
morning
for
this
runs
along
close
to
the
brick
wall
and
as
we
three
floors
up
you
get
a
good
view
of
the
whole
place
this
window
in
my
room
is
the
best
place
of
all
to
see
it
fortunately
but
the
queer
thing
about
it
is
that
though
the
shutters
are
all
tightly
closed
or
bowed
every
one
and
the
whole
place
looks
deserted
it
really
there
some
one
living
in
it
and
once
in
a
long
while
you
happen
to
see
signs
of
it
for
instance
that
very
afternoon
i
saw
this
all
the
shutters
are
tightly
closed
but
on
the
second
floor
they
are
usually
just
bowed
and
that
day
the
slats
in
one
of
them
were
open
and
i
thought
i
could
see
a
muslin
curtain
flapping
behind
it
but
while
i
was
looking
the
fingers
of
a
hand
suddenly
appeared
between
the
slats
and
snapped
them
shut
with
a
jerk
of
course
there
nothing
so
awfully
strange
about
a
thing
like
that
a
but
somehow
the
way
it
was
done
seemed
i
ca
explain
just
why
anyhow
as
i
had
anything
else
to
do
i
concluded
i
sit
there
for
a
while
longer
and
see
if
something
else
would
happen
but
nothing
did
not
for
nearly
an
hour
and
i
was
getting
tired
of
the
thing
and
just
going
to
get
up
and
go
away
breathed
janet
in
an
excited
whisper
the
big
front
door
opened
it
was
nearly
dark
by
that
time
and
out
crept
the
queerest
little
figure
it
appeared
to
be
a
little
old
woman
all
dressed
in
dingy
black
clothes
that
looked
as
if
they
must
have
come
out
of
the
ark
they
were
so
her
hat
was
a
queer
little
bonnet
with
no
trimming
except
a
heavy
black
veil
that
came
down
over
her
face
she
had
a
small
on
her
arm
and
a
big
old
umbrella
but
the
queerest
thing
was
the
way
she
scuttled
down
the
path
to
the
gate
like
a
frightened
rabbit
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
she
was
afraid
of
being
seen
or
watched
when
she
got
to
the
gate
she
had
to
put
down
her
basket
and
umbrella
and
use
both
hands
to
unlock
it
with
a
huge
key
when
she
got
outside
of
it
on
the
street
she
shut
the
gate
behind
her
and
of
course
i
could
see
her
any
more
well
it
set
me
to
wondering
and
wondering
what
the
story
of
that
queer
old
house
and
queer
little
old
lady
could
be
it
seemed
as
if
there
be
some
story
about
it
or
some
explanation
for
you
see
it
a
big
place
and
evidently
at
one
time
must
have
been
very
handsome
and
it
stands
right
here
in
one
of
the
busiest
and
most
valuable
parts
of
the
city
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
curious
i
grew
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
i
did
know
a
soul
who
could
tell
me
the
least
thing
about
it
aunt
minerva
could
of
course
and
i
was
acquainted
with
another
person
in
the
city
it
just
seemed
as
if
i
find
some
explanation
then
all
of
a
sudden
i
thought
of
our
new
colored
maid
perhaps
she
might
have
heard
something
about
it
i
made
up
my
mind
go
right
out
to
the
kitchen
so
i
went
and
started
her
talking
about
things
in
general
and
finally
asked
her
if
she
knew
anything
about
that
old
house
and
i
wish
you
could
have
heard
her
i
ca
tell
it
all
the
way
she
did
but
this
is
the
substance
of
it
it
seems
that
she
discovered
that
the
janitor
here
is
the
son
of
an
old
friend
from
north
carolina
of
course
she
been
talking
to
him
a
lot
and
he
has
told
her
all
about
the
whole
neighborhood
and
especially
about
the
queer
old
house
next
door
he
says
it
known
all
around
here
as
folly
why
queried
janet
well
because
years
and
years
ago
when
the
owner
built
it
his
name
was
benedict
it
was
out
of
the
city
limits
and
everybody
thought
he
was
awfully
foolish
going
so
far
and
building
a
handsome
city
house
off
in
the
wilderness
but
he
was
so
foolish
after
all
for
the
city
came
right
up
and
surrounded
him
in
the
end
and
the
property
is
worth
no
end
of
money
now
but
here
the
queer
thing
about
it
old
benedict
been
dead
many
years
and
the
place
looks
as
if
no
one
lived
there
but
one
it
a
daughter
of
his
a
queer
little
old
lady
who
keeps
herself
shut
up
there
all
the
time
some
think
she
alone
others
say
no
that
some
one
else
is
there
with
her
no
one
seems
to
know
definitely
anyhow
although
she
is
very
wealthy
she
does
all
the
work
herself
and
the
marketing
and
she
even
carries
home
all
the
things
and
wo
allow
a
single
one
of
the
tradesmen
to
come
in
simmonds
that
our
janitor
says
that
two
years
ago
in
the
winter
a
there
burst
and
miss
benedict
just
to
get
a
plumber
and
he
afterward
told
awfully
peculiar
things
about
the
way
the
house
looked
the
furniture
all
draped
and
covered
up
and
even
the
pictures
on
the
walls
covered
too
and
not
a
single
modern
improvement
except
the
running
water
and
some
and
the
little
old
lady
never
raised
her
veil
while
he
was
there
so
he
see
what
she
looked
like
simmonds
says
every
one
thinks
there
is
some
great
mystery
about
folly
but
no
one
seems
to
be
able
to
guess
what
it
can
be
now
janet
is
that
just
fascinating
think
of
living
next
door
to
a
mystery
it
simply
thrilling
sighed
janet
but
marcia
i
still
do
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
a
where
do
come
in
i
do
see
why
you
could
have
written
all
this
to
me
wait
said
marcia
i
have
finished
yet
that
was
absolutely
all
i
could
get
out
of
our
maid
eliza
all
she
or
any
one
else
knew
in
fact
but
as
you
can
imagine
i
could
get
the
thing
out
of
my
mind
and
i
could
stop
looking
at
the
old
place
either
i
tried
to
talk
to
aunt
minerva
about
it
but
she
was
a
bit
interested
said
she
understand
how
any
one
could
keep
house
in
that
slovenly
fashion
and
that
all
she
would
say
so
i
gave
up
trying
to
interest
now
i
must
tell
you
the
odd
thing
that
happened
that
very
night
you
know
i
said
it
was
raining
hard
all
that
day
and
by
ten
the
wind
was
blowing
a
gale
i
was
just
ready
for
bed
and
had
turned
off
my
light
and
raised
the
shade
when
i
thought
i
take
another
peep
at
my
mysterious
mansion
across
the
fence
all
i
could
see
however
were
just
some
streaks
of
light
through
the
chinks
in
the
shutters
in
that
one
room
on
the
second
floor
all
the
rest
of
the
place
was
as
dark
as
a
pocket
and
as
i
sat
staring
out
it
suddenly
came
to
me
what
fun
it
would
be
to
try
to
unravel
the
whole
mysterious
affair
all
by
myself
it
would
certainly
help
me
to
pass
the
dull
days
till
you
came
but
then
too
the
only
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
watch
this
old
place
like
a
cat
and
i
knew
would
be
right
it
would
be
too
much
like
spying
into
your
neighbor
affairs
and
of
course
that
horrid
finally
i
concluded
that
if
i
could
do
it
without
being
meddlesome
or
prying
i
just
watch
the
place
a
and
see
if
anything
interesting
would
happen
and
while
i
was
thinking
this
a
strange
thing
happen
that
very
minute
the
wind
had
grown
terrific
and
all
of
a
sudden
it
just
took
one
of
the
shutters
of
that
lighted
room
and
ripped
it
from
its
fastening
and
threw
it
back
against
the
wall
and
the
next
moment
a
figure
hurried
to
the
window
leaned
out
and
drew
the
shutter
back
in
place
again
but
just
for
one
instant
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
whole
inside
of
the
room
and
what
do
you
suppose
i
saw
jan
demanded
janet
well
not
much
of
the
furnishing
except
a
lighted
on
a
table
but
directly
in
the
center
of
the
room
in
a
perfectly
enormous
armchair
sat
a
woman
and
it
was
the
one
i
seen
in
the
afternoon
either
i
sure
of
that
i
could
see
her
face
for
it
was
in
shadow
but
she
was
looking
down
at
something
spread
out
on
her
lap
and
she
held
her
right
hand
over
it
in
the
air
and
waved
it
back
and
forth
sort
of
uncertainly
you
ca
imagine
what
a
strange
picture
it
was
and
then
the
shutter
was
closed
there
was
something
so
about
it
all
if
i
was
curious
before
i
was
simply
with
interest
then
it
seemed
as
if
i
know
what
it
all
meant
what
that
strange
old
lady
could
be
doing
sitting
there
in
state
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
all
the
rest
of
it
you
do
blame
me
do
you
jan
indeed
i
do
i
be
ten
times
worse
i
guess
but
what
about
the
and
you
find
out
anything
else
yes
i
did
and
that
the
secret
the
whole
mysterious
thing
is
in
the
secret
because
no
one
but
you
knows
i
the
least
interested
in
the
affair
and
i
do
want
them
to
now
i
tell
you
what
happened
next
but
just
at
this
moment
they
were
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
door
and
a
voice
inquiring
girls
have
you
gone
to
bed
yet
i
heard
you
talking
for
the
last
hour
no
aunt
minerva
answered
marcia
we
are
sitting
by
the
window
well
you
must
go
to
bed
it
nearly
midnight
you
either
of
you
be
fit
for
a
thing
now
mind
not
another
word
they
both
answered
but
heaved
a
sigh
when
aunt
minerva
was
out
of
hearing
it
no
use
whispered
marcia
we
have
to
stop
for
but
there
lots
more
and
the
interesting
part
of
it
too
well
never
mind
i
tell
you
all
the
rest
chapter
ii
the
face
behind
the
shutter
janet
had
no
sooner
hopped
out
of
bed
next
morning
than
she
flew
to
the
window
to
examine
benedict
folly
by
broad
daylight
in
the
streaming
sun
of
a
june
morning
the
dingy
old
mansion
certainly
bore
out
the
truth
of
marcia
mysterious
description
gracious
i
should
think
you
would
have
been
interested
in
it
from
the
first
she
exclaimed
interested
in
what
yawned
marcia
sleepily
opening
her
eyes
folly
of
course
let
see
went
on
janet
who
possessed
a
very
practical
orderly
mind
from
your
story
last
night
it
seems
there
must
be
two
people
living
there
but
look
here
how
did
you
know
marcia
that
it
was
another
old
lady
you
saw
that
night
when
the
shutter
blew
open
why
for
several
reasons
answered
marcia
in
the
first
place
the
one
who
goes
out
is
short
and
slight
the
one
sitting
in
the
chair
was
evidently
large
and
rather
stout
and
and
different
somehow
although
i
did
see
either
of
their
faces
and
then
it
was
the
lady
in
the
chair
who
closed
the
shutter
she
evidently
never
moved
so
it
have
been
some
one
else
yes
it
must
have
been
agreed
janet
convinced
queer
that
nobody
seems
to
know
about
the
second
one
i
wonder
who
she
is
and
are
there
any
more
go
on
with
your
story
marcia
no
said
marcia
wait
till
we
can
be
by
ourselves
for
a
long
while
i
do
want
to
be
interrupted
aunt
minerva
going
out
this
morning
and
then
we
have
a
chance
so
later
in
the
morning
the
two
girls
sat
by
marcia
window
each
occupied
with
a
dainty
bit
of
embroidery
and
marcia
began
anew
well
after
that
rainy
night
for
several
days
i
did
see
a
thing
more
that
was
interesting
about
the
old
house
or
the
queer
people
who
live
in
it
i
used
to
watch
once
in
a
while
to
see
if
the
little
lady
in
black
would
go
out
again
in
the
afternoon
as
she
did
before
but
she
did
then
a
day
or
two
later
i
did
something
that
surprised
even
myself
for
i
had
the
faintest
of
doing
it
i
had
been
taking
a
walk
that
afternoon
and
was
just
coming
home
passing
on
the
way
the
high
brick
wall
of
the
benedict
house
it
was
just
as
i
reached
the
closed
gate
that
an
idea
popped
into
my
head
you
know
they
say
that
no
visitors
are
ever
admitted
and
no
rings
or
knocks
at
the
gate
are
ever
answered
well
something
suddenly
prompted
me
to
ring
that
bell
and
see
what
would
happen
i
never
stopped
to
ask
myself
what
i
should
say
if
some
one
came
and
inquired
what
i
wanted
i
just
rang
it
suddenly
and
i
had
to
pull
hard
the
old
thing
was
so
rusty
and
far
away
somewhere
in
the
house
i
heard
a
faint
tinkle
then
i
got
kind
of
wondering
what
i
say
if
any
one
did
really
come
but
i
need
have
worried
for
what
do
you
suppose
happened
nothing
answered
janet
promptly
that
just
where
you
mistaken
but
you
never
guess
what
it
was
about
a
minute
after
i
rung
the
bell
i
heard
light
footsteps
on
the
walk
behind
the
gate
instead
of
coming
the
gate
they
were
hurrying
from
it
and
in
another
minute
i
heard
the
front
door
close
after
that
it
was
all
quiet
and
nothing
else
happened
then
i
went
on
home
i
know
interrupted
janet
whose
quick
mind
had
already
worked
out
the
problem
exactly
what
occurred
it
was
miss
benedict
who
had
been
just
about
to
come
out
on
her
way
to
do
the
marketing
and
your
ring
frightened
her
and
sent
her
hurrying
back
into
the
house
it
all
singular
yes
that
must
have
been
it
agreed
marcia
and
it
made
me
more
curious
than
ever
to
understand
about
it
and
i
was
so
annoyed
at
myself
for
ringing
at
all
if
i
had
i
might
have
seen
miss
benedict
close
by
when
she
came
out
of
the
gate
it
served
me
right
for
doing
such
a
thing
anyhow
but
after
that
i
got
to
watching
every
time
i
went
out
thinking
i
might
see
her
on
the
street
somewhere
especially
if
it
was
about
the
time
she
usually
did
her
marketing
along
toward
dusk
several
days
passed
however
and
i
never
did
i
thought
of
watching
from
my
window
to
see
when
she
went
out
and
then
following
her
but
that
seem
right
somehow
it
would
be
too
much
like
spying
on
her
so
i
just
concluded
i
trust
to
chance
and
luck
favored
me
at
last
one
morning
about
a
week
after
i
rung
her
bell
it
happened
that
the
night
before
eliza
suddenly
discovered
we
were
all
out
of
oatmeal
for
breakfast
and
i
promised
her
i
get
some
very
early
in
the
morning
when
i
went
to
take
my
walk
you
know
i
found
that
on
these
warm
summer
days
in
the
city
it
much
pleasanter
to
take
a
walk
in
the
real
early
morning
than
to
wait
till
later
in
the
day
when
it
crowded
and
hot
and
i
always
used
to
love
walking
in
the
early
morning
up
in
northam
well
anyhow
i
got
up
that
day
about
six
i
knew
that
no
stores
near
here
would
be
open
so
early
and
i
decided
to
walk
over
toward
the
other
side
of
town
it
a
sort
of
poor
section
there
and
the
stores
often
open
up
quite
early
so
that
folks
can
do
their
marketing
before
they
go
to
work
it
was
a
beautiful
cool
morning
and
i
was
quite
enjoying
myself
when
jan
do
you
think
i
looked
up
and
about
half
a
block
ahead
of
me
was
a
little
black
figure
with
a
hurrying
along
i
it
was
miss
benedict
can
you
imagine
my
surprise
and
delight
i
suddenly
made
up
my
mind
i
keep
behind
her
and
go
into
the
same
store
she
did
there
could
surely
be
no
harm
in
and
by
and
by
i
saw
her
turn
into
a
little
and
a
minute
or
two
after
in
i
walked
went
to
the
counter
and
stood
right
near
her
there
was
no
one
in
the
store
beside
ourselves
and
the
grocer
he
looked
sleepy
and
was
yawning
while
he
wrapped
up
something
for
her
he
asked
me
to
a
minute
please
which
of
course
i
was
only
too
delighted
to
do
as
it
gave
me
a
perfect
right
to
stand
close
by
my
mysterious
little
neighbor
and
hear
her
speak
and
it
was
right
there
janet
that
i
got
the
surprise
of
my
life
she
still
wore
her
black
veil
and
it
was
so
thick
that
not
a
bit
of
her
face
could
be
seen
her
dress
was
the
most
thing
it
looked
twenty
years
old
if
not
more
i
do
know
what
sort
of
a
voice
i
had
expected
to
hear
but
it
was
nothing
in
the
least
like
what
i
hear
i
ca
exactly
describe
it
to
you
jan
but
it
was
the
most
beautiful
voice
i
ever
heard
in
my
life
it
was
soft
and
and
so
so
it
somehow
went
straight
to
my
heart
it
made
me
feel
as
if
i
wanted
to
take
of
miss
benedict
somehow
i
ca
exactly
explain
it
even
when
she
was
speaking
of
such
commonplace
things
as
butter
and
eggs
and
sugar
it
was
like
like
well
in
a
few
moments
she
had
finished
and
the
grocer
packed
her
things
in
her
basket
and
she
went
away
i
had
to
stay
of
course
and
get
my
oatmeal
and
i
did
see
her
again
but
being
so
close
to
her
and
hearing
that
lovely
voice
had
changed
my
whole
feeling
about
her
at
first
i
had
just
been
interested
and
awfully
about
the
whole
mysterious
affair
and
i
confess
just
a
wee
bit
repelled
by
the
account
of
the
queer
little
lady
and
the
strange
way
she
lived
i
wanted
to
know
the
explanation
of
the
mystery
but
i
did
particularly
want
to
know
but
after
that
i
felt
different
sort
of
bewitched
by
that
beautiful
voice
i
wanted
to
that
miss
benedict
i
wanted
to
something
for
her
or
try
to
make
her
happier
or
or
i
could
quite
explain
what
and
i
wanted
oh
so
much
to
see
her
and
know
what
she
was
like
and
more
about
can
you
understand
jan
indeed
i
can
but
do
go
on
did
you
ever
meet
her
again
no
i
did
but
i
seen
and
heard
something
else
that
strange
more
strange
than
all
the
rest
tell
me
quick
demanded
janet
two
nights
ago
i
sat
here
by
the
window
it
was
too
hot
to
turn
on
the
light
but
it
was
very
dark
outside
presently
i
heard
footsteps
in
the
benedict
garden
they
were
light
quick
footsteps
and
sounded
exactly
as
if
some
one
were
running
about
or
skipping
and
jumping
first
i
thought
it
must
be
a
big
dog
for
it
could
possibly
have
been
either
one
of
those
two
old
ladies
running
and
skipping
that
way
and
then
i
heard
a
soft
humming
as
if
some
one
were
singing
a
tune
half
under
the
breath
and
then
very
soon
after
a
door
opened
and
a
voice
called
out
very
softly
in
now
and
after
that
all
was
quiet
now
janet
mcneil
i
simply
positive
there
one
in
that
house
beside
the
two
old
ladies
some
one
who
has
been
seen
yet
what
do
you
make
of
it
you
must
be
right
replied
janet
thoughtfully
it
be
either
of
them
running
about
in
the
garden
in
the
dark
and
humming
a
tune
it
is
at
all
what
they
be
likely
to
do
i
think
it
must
be
some
one
else
more
more
and
natural
somehow
and
younger
too
but
what
on
do
they
all
keep
so
shut
up
for
and
act
as
if
they
were
afraid
to
be
seen
it
the
queerest
thing
i
ever
heard
of
you
certainly
moved
next
door
to
a
mystery
marcia
for
the
ensuing
hour
the
girls
embroidered
steadily
and
discussed
benedict
folly
and
its
inmates
in
all
their
peculiar
phases
but
turn
and
twist
it
as
they
might
they
could
find
no
answer
to
the
riddle
after
a
while
janet
changed
the
subject
by
the
way
marcia
how
are
you
coming
on
with
your
violin
practice
have
you
begun
taking
lessons
here
yet
you
know
that
was
one
of
the
principal
things
you
folks
moved
to
the
city
for
so
that
you
could
study
with
the
best
teachers
yes
i
begun
with
professor
hardwick
said
marcia
and
practised
quite
hard
lately
it
about
all
i
had
to
do
he
says
made
some
progress
already
oh
get
your
violin
and
play
some
for
me
begged
janet
just
starving
for
some
good
music
i
have
heard
any
since
you
left
northam
so
marcia
obligingly
went
to
the
parlor
and
brought
back
her
violin
when
she
had
tuned
it
and
tucked
it
lovingly
under
her
chin
she
sat
down
in
the
and
ran
her
bow
over
the
strings
in
a
shower
of
liquid
melody
for
one
so
young
she
played
astonishingly
well
janet
listened
breathless
absorbed
marcia
dear
you
improved
she
exclaimed
as
her
chum
stopped
for
a
moment
now
do
play
my
favorite
marcia
laid
her
bow
on
the
strings
once
more
and
slipped
into
the
tender
reverie
of
the
träumerei
but
before
it
was
half
finished
janet
with
astonishment
laid
her
hand
on
marcia
arm
look
she
breathed
marcia
followed
the
direction
of
her
gaze
and
turned
to
stare
out
of
the
window
at
the
house
opposite
and
this
is
what
she
saw
the
shutter
of
a
window
on
the
top
floor
had
been
pushed
partly
open
and
a
face
looked
out
a
face
with
big
appealing
eyes
and
a
frame
of
golden
curling
hair
falling
all
about
it
straight
over
at
the
two
in
the
window
it
gazed
eager
absorbed
delighted
and
then
suddenly
as
it
detected
their
own
interested
stare
it
withdrew
and
the
shutter
was
softly
closed
the
two
girls
drew
a
long
breath
and
gazed
at
each
other
janet
did
i
tell
you
there
some
one
else
in
that
house
cried
marcia
i
guess
you
right
admitted
janet
quieter
but
no
less
excited
but
do
you
realize
who
that
third
person
marcia
brett
it
an
old
lady
it
some
one
just
about
our
own
age
it
a
young
chapter
iii
the
gate
opens
for
the
two
ensuing
days
marcia
and
janet
tense
with
excitement
discussed
the
most
recently
discovered
inmate
of
benedict
folly
and
watched
incessantly
for
another
glimpse
of
the
face
behind
the
shutter
how
was
it
they
constantly
demanded
of
each
other
that
a
girl
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
had
come
to
be
shut
up
in
the
dreary
old
place
was
she
a
prisoner
there
was
she
a
relative
friend
or
servant
was
she
free
to
come
and
go
to
the
latter
question
they
unanimously
voted
no
how
could
she
be
aught
else
but
a
prisoner
when
she
was
never
seen
going
in
or
out
was
forced
to
take
her
exercise
after
nightfall
in
the
dark
garden
and
was
kept
constantly
behind
closed
shutters
no
girl
of
that
age
in
her
right
mind
could
deliberately
a
life
like
that
do
you
suppose
she
has
always
lived
there
queried
marcia
for
the
twentieth
time
and
as
janet
could
answer
it
no
better
than
herself
she
propounded
another
question
and
why
do
you
suppose
she
opened
the
shutter
and
looked
out
seeming
so
delighted
when
i
played
and
then
drew
in
again
so
quickly
when
we
noticed
her
is
afraid
of
being
seen
too
evidently
said
janet
she
must
be
as
full
of
mystery
as
the
rest
of
them
and
yet
i
somehow
feel
that
she
like
them
so
sweet
and
young
and
oh
know
what
i
mean
of
course
she
knew
but
it
did
help
them
in
the
least
to
solve
this
latest
phase
of
their
mystery
finally
marcia
who
still
clung
a
bit
shyly
to
the
fairy
lore
of
her
earlier
years
declared
i
believe
she
a
regular
kept
there
to
do
all
the
hard
work
of
the
place
by
those
queer
old
ladies
and
i
should
be
a
bit
surprised
if
she
down
in
the
kitchen
this
minute
cleaning
out
the
ashes
of
the
stove
come
jan
let
go
for
a
walk
and
when
we
come
back
i
play
on
the
violin
by
the
window
maybe
our
little
will
peep
out
again
the
two
girls
put
on
their
hats
and
strolled
out
for
their
usual
afternoon
walk
and
treat
of
soda
but
they
had
gone
no
farther
from
their
own
door
than
the
length
of
the
benedict
brick
wall
when
they
were
suddenly
brought
to
a
halt
in
front
of
the
closed
gate
by
hearing
a
sound
on
the
other
side
of
it
it
was
a
sound
indicative
of
some
struggling
attempt
to
open
it
the
click
of
a
key
turning
and
turning
in
the
lock
and
the
futile
rattling
of
the
iron
knob
and
then
the
sound
of
a
voice
murmuring
oh
dear
what
i
do
i
ca
get
this
open
janet
whispered
marcia
that
the
voice
of
miss
benedict
i
it
i
believe
it
and
she
trying
to
run
away
what
shall
we
do
stay
here
no
janet
whispered
back
let
just
stroll
on
a
little
way
and
then
turn
back
we
can
see
what
happens
then
without
seeming
to
be
watching
they
walked
on
quickly
for
a
number
of
yards
and
then
turned
to
approach
the
gate
again
even
as
they
did
so
they
saw
it
open
and
out
stepped
a
little
figure
it
was
not
miss
benedict
the
slim
trim
little
girlish
form
was
clad
in
plain
dark
clothes
of
a
slightly
unfamiliar
cut
but
the
face
was
the
one
that
had
appeared
in
the
upper
window
and
the
thick
golden
curls
were
surmounted
by
a
black
velvet
on
her
arm
she
carried
a
small
and
her
eyes
had
a
bewildered
almost
frightened
look
in
their
excited
interest
marcia
and
janet
had
quite
unconsciously
stopped
short
where
they
were
and
waited
to
see
which
way
their
would
turn
but
though
they
stood
so
for
an
appreciable
moment
she
turned
neither
way
and
only
stood
her
back
to
the
gate
gazing
uncertainly
to
the
right
and
left
and
then
perceiving
them
she
seemed
to
take
a
sudden
resolution
and
turned
to
them
appealingly
oh
please
you
direct
me
how
to
find
this
she
asked
holding
out
a
slip
of
paper
marcia
hurried
to
her
side
and
read
the
written
address
and
when
she
had
read
it
she
realized
that
it
was
the
little
on
the
other
side
of
town
where
she
had
once
encountered
miss
benedict
why
certainly
she
cried
you
walk
over
five
blocks
in
that
direction
then
turn
to
your
left
and
down
three
you
ca
miss
it
it
right
next
to
a
shoemaker
place
the
child
looked
more
bewildered
than
ever
and
her
eyes
strayed
to
the
busy
near
which
they
stood
crowded
with
hurrying
trucks
and
automobiles
thank
you
she
faltered
do
i
go
this
way
and
then
with
sudden
candor
you
see
i
strange
in
these
streets
her
voice
was
clear
and
pretty
but
her
accent
markedly
both
girls
half
consciously
noted
it
see
here
said
marcia
would
you
care
to
have
us
take
you
there
we
not
going
in
any
special
direction
and
i
been
there
before
an
infinitely
relieved
expression
came
over
the
girl
face
oh
you
be
so
kind
i
just
just
scared
to
death
on
these
streets
they
turned
to
accompany
her
one
on
each
side
and
piloted
her
safely
across
the
busy
avenue
then
in
the
quiet
stretch
of
the
next
block
they
proceeded
together
in
complete
and
embarrassing
silence
it
was
a
silence
that
marcia
and
janet
had
fully
expected
their
companion
to
break
possibly
to
reveal
some
reason
for
her
errand
and
her
strangeness
in
the
streets
they
themselves
hesitated
to
say
much
for
fear
of
seeming
curious
or
anxious
to
force
her
confidence
but
she
said
not
a
word
the
strain
at
last
became
too
much
for
janet
i
do
blame
you
for
feeling
nervous
in
these
city
streets
she
began
i
a
country
girl
myself
and
i
act
like
a
scared
rabbit
whenever
i
go
out
alone
here
the
girl
turned
to
her
with
a
little
confiding
gesture
i
never
been
out
in
them
alone
before
she
said
then
there
was
another
silence
during
which
marcia
and
janet
both
searched
frantically
in
their
minds
for
something
else
to
say
but
it
was
the
girl
herself
who
broke
the
silence
the
second
time
thank
you
for
your
music
the
other
day
she
said
turning
to
marcia
i
heard
you
i
often
hear
you
and
listen
oh
i
so
glad
you
liked
it
cried
marcia
do
you
care
for
music
i
adore
it
she
replied
simply
look
here
exclaimed
marcia
suddenly
how
did
you
know
it
was
i
that
played
the
violin
because
i
watched
you
often
through
the
slats
marcia
and
janet
exchanged
glances
so
the
watching
was
not
all
on
side
of
the
fence
here
was
a
revelation
that
last
thing
you
played
the
other
day
will
you
will
you
tell
me
what
it
was
went
on
their
new
companion
shyly
why
that
was
schumann
answered
marcia
i
love
it
do
you
yes
but
i
never
heard
it
before
that
is
i
never
hearing
it
and
yet
somehow
i
seemed
to
it
i
ca
think
why
i
understand
it
as
if
i
it
i
think
marcia
and
janet
again
exchanged
glances
what
a
strange
child
this
was
who
talked
of
having
dreamed
music
that
was
quite
familiar
to
almost
every
one
perhaps
you
heard
it
at
a
concert
suggested
janet
i
never
went
to
a
concert
she
replied
much
to
their
amazement
and
then
perceiving
their
surprise
she
added
you
see
i
always
lived
off
in
the
country
in
just
a
little
village
till
now
oh
yes
answered
janet
pretending
enlightenment
though
in
truth
she
and
marcia
were
more
bewildered
than
ever
but
by
this
time
they
had
reached
the
little
and
all
proceeded
inside
while
their
new
friend
made
her
purchases
these
she
read
off
slowly
from
a
slip
of
paper
and
the
grocer
packed
them
in
her
basket
but
when
it
came
to
paying
for
them
and
making
change
she
became
entangled
in
a
fresh
puzzle
i
think
you
said
these
eggs
were
a
shilling
she
ventured
to
the
grocer
shilling
no
i
said
they
were
a
quarter
he
retorted
impatiently
a
quarter
she
queried
and
turned
questioning
eyes
to
her
two
friends
he
means
this
said
marcia
picking
out
a
piece
from
the
change
the
girl
held
oh
thank
you
i
do
understand
this
american
money
she
explained
and
marcia
and
janet
added
another
query
to
their
rapidly
growing
mental
list
on
the
way
back
home
however
she
grew
silent
again
and
though
the
girls
chatted
back
and
forth
about
quite
impersonal
matters
the
crowded
streets
the
warm
weather
the
sights
they
passed
she
was
not
to
be
drawn
into
the
conversation
and
the
nearer
they
drew
to
their
destination
the
more
depressed
she
appeared
to
become
at
last
they
reached
the
gate
shall
you
be
going
out
again
ventured
marcia
if
so
we
will
go
with
you
if
you
care
to
have
us
till
you
get
used
to
the
streets
the
girl
gave
her
a
sudden
pleased
glance
i
i
do
know
she
said
you
see
miss
benedict
hurt
her
ankle
a
day
or
two
ago
and
she
get
around
much
so
so
i
doing
this
for
her
if
she
wants
me
to
go
i
will
i
be
glad
to
go
with
you
how
shall
i
let
you
know
just
hang
a
white
handkerchief
to
your
shutter
before
you
go
and
see
it
we
watch
for
it
cried
marcia
inventing
the
signal
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
then
impetuously
she
added
my
name
is
marcia
brett
and
this
is
janet
mcneil
wo
you
tell
us
yours
if
we
to
be
friends
i
cecily
marlowe
she
answered
and
i
glad
to
know
you
as
she
spoke
she
was
fumbling
with
the
big
key
in
the
lock
of
the
gate
and
as
the
latter
swung
open
she
turned
once
more
to
face
them
with
a
little
sob
i
do
know
why
i
here
and
i
lonely
then
frightened
at
having
revealed
so
much
she
turned
quickly
away
and
shut
the
gate
as
they
listened
to
her
footsteps
retreating
up
the
path
and
the
closing
of
the
front
door
marcia
and
janet
turned
to
each
other
a
thousand
questions
burning
on
their
tongues
but
all
they
could
exclaim
in
one
breath
was
did
you
chapter
iv
the
backward
glance
the
next
hours
were
spent
in
delightful
speculation
so
her
name
was
cecily
marlowe
was
she
any
relation
of
miss
benedict
marlowe
and
benedict
were
certainly
dissimilar
enough
but
then
she
might
be
a
relation
on
miss
benedict
mother
side
suggested
marcia
does
it
sound
likely
when
you
think
what
she
said
just
at
the
last
that
she
did
know
why
she
was
there
replied
janet
scornfully
she
could
be
in
doubt
about
it
if
she
were
a
either
come
on
a
visit
or
there
to
stay
which
argument
settled
question
but
where
do
you
suppose
she
has
come
from
marveled
marcia
she
said
she
always
lived
in
a
little
country
village
and
she
did
know
a
thing
about
american
money
she
foreign
that
certain
even
her
clothes
and
her
way
of
speaking
show
it
but
from
where
did
you
notice
that
she
said
suggested
janet
that
shows
she
must
be
english
she
english
now
will
you
tell
me
how
she
could
get
over
here
from
england
and
not
know
why
she
had
come
it
sounds
as
if
she
might
have
been
kidnapped
said
marcia
why
janet
this
is
precisely
like
a
mystery
in
a
book
do
you
it
and
here
we
are
living
right
next
door
to
it
it
too
good
to
be
true
janet
mind
had
however
gone
off
on
another
tack
i
ca
understand
that
remark
she
made
about
the
music
is
certainly
about
as
well
known
as
any
piece
of
classic
music
she
said
she
never
remembered
hearing
it
and
yet
it
seems
somehow
familiar
to
her
can
you
make
anything
out
of
marcia
could
maybe
it
all
just
a
notion
she
suggested
helplessly
suppose
i
play
some
on
the
violin
here
in
our
window
right
now
she
seems
to
enjoy
it
so
and
maybe
she
open
her
shutter
again
so
they
sat
on
the
and
marcia
played
her
very
best
including
the
träumerei
but
no
golden
head
appeared
from
behind
the
shutter
that
afternoon
never
mind
said
janet
we
see
her
most
likely
perhaps
she
busy
downstairs
now
but
is
she
the
prettiest
little
thing
mused
marcia
reminiscently
the
loveliest
big
blue
eyes
and
curly
golden
hair
and
such
a
look
in
her
face
somehow
it
went
right
down
to
the
very
bottom
of
my
heart
if
it
does
sound
silly
to
put
it
that
way
yes
i
know
agreed
janet
i
felt
the
same
way
but
does
it
strike
you
queer
that
oh
the
whole
thing
queer
interrupted
marcia
the
queerest
i
ever
heard
of
i
guess
you
agree
with
me
now
janet
that
i
had
a
secret
worth
talking
about
in
folly
but
let
wait
till
and
see
what
happens
the
morrow
came
and
went
however
and
nothing
happened
at
all
hour
after
hour
the
two
girls
watched
for
the
signal
of
the
white
handkerchief
but
every
shuttered
window
of
the
old
mansion
remained
blank
neither
did
any
one
go
in
or
out
of
the
gate
late
in
the
afternoon
marcia
played
again
at
the
window
but
the
sweetest
music
called
forth
not
a
single
sign
from
behind
the
walls
of
the
house
next
door
janet
had
but
one
solution
to
offer
they
probably
did
need
any
marketing
done
so
she
naturally
did
go
out
but
why
could
she
have
at
least
looked
out
a
moment
from
her
window
cried
marcia
disconsolately
surely
that
would
have
been
easy
to
do
when
she
said
she
cared
so
much
for
the
music
she
must
have
i
was
playing
just
for
her
she
may
have
been
somewhere
in
the
house
where
she
could
you
tell
and
ought
to
blame
her
without
knowing
declared
janet
defending
the
conduct
of
the
mysterious
cecily
we
see
her
again
no
doubt
on
the
morrow
her
prophecy
was
fulfilled
they
did
see
her
again
but
under
circumstances
so
peculiar
that
they
were
quite
dumfounded
all
the
morning
they
watched
and
waited
in
vain
for
some
signal
from
the
upper
window
but
none
came
and
the
main
part
of
the
afternoon
passed
in
precisely
the
same
way
they
sat
very
conspicuously
in
their
own
so
that
there
could
be
no
doubt
in
cecily
mind
about
their
being
at
home
marcia
even
did
a
little
violin
practice
while
they
waited
and
still
there
was
no
sign
suddenly
about
five
janet
clutched
at
her
chum
arm
look
she
cried
marcia
looked
and
down
the
path
from
the
front
door
of
the
strange
house
she
saw
cecily
dressed
to
go
out
approaching
the
gate
it
was
plain
that
she
was
bound
on
another
marketing
expedition
for
the
basket
hung
from
her
arm
what
do
you
make
of
that
exclaimed
marcia
in
bewilderment
did
she
signal
to
us
no
she
did
returned
janet
i
watched
every
minute
she
have
forgotten
it
but
do
you
know
there
may
be
some
very
good
reason
why
she
did
or
could
and
perhaps
she
hoping
see
her
and
be
on
hand
outside
anyway
as
we
promised
but
she
have
seen
us
sitting
in
the
window
argued
marcia
she
might
at
least
have
looked
up
and
waved
her
hand
or
nodded
or
smiled
or
something
cecily
meanwhile
was
fumbling
with
the
lock
of
the
big
old
gate
which
seemed
as
on
a
former
occasion
to
give
her
a
great
deal
of
trouble
come
cried
janet
to
marcia
we
just
about
have
time
to
catch
her
if
we
hurry
and
seizing
their
hats
the
girls
hastened
downstairs
their
front
door
closed
behind
them
just
as
cecily
came
abreast
of
them
what
happened
next
was
like
a
blow
in
the
face
illustration
cecily
marlowe
passed
them
by
without
a
look
they
had
started
forward
each
with
a
friendly
smile
expecting
their
new
companion
to
meet
them
in
similar
fashion
to
their
amazement
cecily
marlowe
after
the
first
sudden
look
into
their
faces
dropped
her
eyes
and
passed
them
by
without
a
glance
precisely
as
if
they
were
utter
strangers
to
her
both
girls
gasped
stared
at
her
departing
figure
till
she
turned
the
corner
and
then
into
each
other
faces
the
ungrateful
little
thing
marcia
presently
exploded
if
that
was
the
direct
i
never
seen
it
before
an
unmistakable
way
of
telling
us
to
mind
our
own
business
even
janet
had
to
admit
how
humiliating
and
yet
yet
what
demanded
marcia
indignantly
you
surely
not
going
to
try
to
excuse
such
inexcusable
conduct
as
i
see
very
plainly
what
happened
she
thought
it
over
and
decided
that
we
were
meddlesome
and
just
trying
to
an
acquaintance
with
her
and
she
thinks
she
a
little
too
exclusive
for
that
kind
of
thing
and
the
simple
remedy
was
to
us
dead
marcia
was
quite
out
of
breath
when
she
finished
this
summing
up
it
look
like
it
janet
admitted
but
somehow
even
yet
i
ca
feel
that
she
to
do
it
of
her
own
accord
i
mean
but
marcia
could
see
it
in
that
light
they
discussed
the
question
hotly
still
standing
on
the
front
stoop
of
the
apartment
so
long
in
fact
did
they
argue
it
back
and
forth
turning
and
twisting
the
sorry
little
occurrence
viewing
it
in
every
possible
light
that
before
they
realized
it
cecily
was
returning
her
errands
accomplished
how
she
had
managed
to
find
her
way
and
cross
the
streets
in
safety
they
could
only
conjecture
to
reach
her
own
gate
she
had
to
pass
directly
by
where
they
were
standing
and
they
saw
her
approaching
down
the
block
here
she
comes
muttered
marcia
now
let
stand
right
here
and
watch
her
as
she
goes
by
she
ca
but
see
us
we
give
her
one
more
chance
to
do
the
proper
thing
and
so
they
waited
breathless
expectant
while
the
girl
came
rapidly
on
her
eyes
cast
down
watching
the
pavement
but
even
when
she
was
quite
in
front
of
them
she
did
not
once
look
up
and
without
comment
their
gaze
followed
her
retreating
figure
to
the
gate
as
she
fitted
the
big
key
and
swung
the
gate
open
they
were
just
about
to
turn
to
each
other
in
angry
impatience
when
something
else
happened
cecily
marlowe
turned
her
head
and
looked
back
at
them
for
one
long
tense
moment
it
was
such
a
wistful
imploring
look
a
gaze
so
full
of
appeal
for
forgiveness
so
plainly
in
contrast
with
her
recent
conduct
that
their
hearts
melted
at
once
simultaneously
they
waved
their
hands
and
smiled
at
her
and
she
smiled
back
in
return
the
most
adorable
little
smile
in
the
world
full
of
trust
and
confidence
and
utter
friendliness
then
she
hurried
in
and
closed
the
gate
leaving
her
two
new
friends
outside
more
bewildered
than
ever
chapter
v
the
handkerchief
in
the
window
the
next
day
was
spent
by
the
two
girls
in
an
expedition
to
one
of
the
ocean
beaches
with
aunt
minerva
under
ordinary
circumstances
it
was
a
treat
that
would
have
delighted
their
hearts
but
as
matters
stood
they
only
chafed
with
impatience
to
be
back
at
their
bedroom
window
watching
the
house
next
door
the
date
for
the
trip
however
had
been
set
some
time
before
and
aunt
minerva
would
have
thought
it
very
strange
if
they
had
begged
off
for
such
flimsy
reason
as
they
could
have
offered
the
day
after
found
them
again
on
watch
though
what
they
expected
to
see
they
could
have
told
it
was
plain
that
in
spite
of
appearances
cecily
marlowe
friendly
feeling
toward
them
was
undiminished
the
charming
backward
smile
had
indicated
unmistakably
but
how
to
make
it
fit
in
with
her
refusal
to
signal
and
her
forbidding
conduct
they
could
not
understand
and
the
mystery
kept
them
in
a
constant
ferment
of
surmise
but
even
as
they
sat
discussing
it
next
morning
their
lying
unheeded
in
their
laps
they
looked
out
suddenly
with
a
simultaneous
gasp
of
astonishment
and
delight
there
was
a
tiny
white
handkerchief
attached
to
the
shutter
in
the
upper
window
and
fluttering
in
the
breeze
it
the
signal
our
signal
cried
marcia
now
what
shall
we
do
show
that
we
seen
it
by
waving
something
here
my
red
silk
scarf
no
decided
janet
perhaps
she
rather
not
have
us
do
anything
that
might
attract
attention
let
go
right
down
to
the
street
as
we
said
we
would
and
see
if
she
there
they
lost
not
a
moment
time
in
reaching
their
front
steps
but
there
was
no
sign
of
cecily
till
they
had
come
abreast
of
the
benedict
gate
this
they
discovered
ajar
and
two
blue
eyes
peeping
out
of
a
narrow
crack
as
they
came
in
sight
there
was
a
smothered
exclamation
oh
i
so
glad
the
gate
opened
wider
and
cecily
stood
before
them
you
are
good
she
began
at
once
in
a
low
voice
stretching
out
both
hands
to
them
i
was
afraid
you
you
would
come
i
left
the
signal
there
almost
all
day
yesterday
we
were
away
cried
marcia
promptly
i
sorry
we
went
oh
then
oh
it
all
right
breathed
cecily
in
relief
i
was
sure
you
were
angry
at
at
the
way
i
acted
it
was
on
the
tip
of
marcia
tongue
to
demand
why
she
acted
so
but
she
refrained
and
cecily
hurried
on
i
i
just
had
to
signal
for
you
i
we
are
in
great
trouble
and
i
do
know
what
to
do
oh
what
it
cried
both
girls
together
miss
miss
benedict
is
very
ill
she
continued
hesitatingly
she
she
fell
and
hurt
her
ankle
the
other
day
and
it
been
getting
worse
ever
since
she
in
bed
suffering
great
pain
both
yesterday
and
it
terribly
swelled
but
why
does
she
send
for
a
doctor
interrupted
janet
hastily
she
to
have
one
if
it
as
bad
as
that
i
asked
her
that
too
yesterday
and
she
only
said
no
i
can
not
must
not
have
a
doctor
child
and
when
i
asked
what
i
could
do
for
her
she
answered
do
know
i
sure
so
there
she
lies
just
suffering
and
and
i
could
think
of
anything
else
to
do
so
i
signaled
to
you
you
are
my
only
friends
in
all
this
city
there
was
something
infinitely
pathetic
about
the
way
she
brought
out
this
last
statement
it
touched
the
hearts
of
both
her
listeners
and
because
of
it
they
inwardly
forgave
her
once
and
for
all
for
any
action
of
hers
that
had
offended
them
and
they
had
the
good
sense
not
to
comment
on
the
strangeness
of
miss
benedict
behavior
well
if
she
wo
have
a
doctor
we
must
think
what
else
there
is
to
be
done
began
janet
practically
i
wish
you
let
me
bring
aunt
minerva
in
to
see
her
said
marcia
she
hurt
her
ankle
just
like
that
two
years
ago
and
she
know
exactly
what
oh
no
no
cried
cecily
starting
forward
miss
benedict
would
not
want
that
does
not
want
to
see
any
one
please
do
not
even
to
your
aunt
anything
about
her
or
me
miss
benedict
would
not
wish
it
the
request
was
certainly
very
peculiar
but
the
girls
were
able
to
conceal
their
surprise
great
as
it
was
very
well
said
marcia
soothingly
if
you
rather
have
it
that
way
we
certainly
wo
speak
of
it
but
i
just
had
another
idea
i
remember
aunt
minerva
had
a
certain
kind
of
salve
that
she
used
for
her
ankle
and
she
kept
it
tightly
bandaged
on
it
did
her
lots
of
good
cured
her
in
fact
now
i
believe
i
could
get
that
salve
at
a
here
oh
you
exclaimed
cecily
in
immense
relief
let
us
go
at
once
but
you
need
trouble
to
go
said
marcia
we
wo
be
ten
minutes
and
will
come
right
back
with
it
i
prefer
to
go
replied
cecily
marlowe
with
such
an
air
of
quiet
finality
that
neither
dared
to
question
it
all
three
started
out
after
cecily
had
locked
the
gate
and
proceeded
to
the
nearest
here
marcia
made
the
purchase
and
paid
for
it
from
the
change
in
her
own
but
when
they
were
outside
the
store
cecily
turned
to
her
gravely
i
have
a
little
english
money
of
my
own
but
i
did
not
like
to
offer
it
in
the
shop
if
you
will
will
tell
me
how
much
the
salve
cost
in
shillings
i
will
give
it
to
you
and
she
held
out
several
english
shillings
to
marcia
oh
you
need
do
that
i
glad
to
be
able
to
think
of
something
to
do
for
miss
benedict
it
such
a
little
matter
please
reiterated
cecily
i
wish
to
tell
her
i
bought
it
myself
why
cried
marcia
and
then
the
next
moment
wished
she
could
recall
a
question
that
seemed
to
border
on
the
personal
because
i
i
dare
not
tell
her
i
have
have
been
talking
to
you
hesitated
cecily
in
an
unusual
burst
of
candor
and
after
that
revelation
they
all
walked
back
to
the
gate
in
an
uneasy
silence
when
they
stood
again
in
front
of
the
blank
barrier
to
the
mysterious
house
cecily
turned
to
marcia
i
love
your
music
she
said
i
always
listen
to
it
whenever
you
play
i
knew
you
had
been
playing
just
for
me
these
last
few
days
and
i
wanted
to
look
out
of
my
window
and
and
wave
to
you
but
i
must
not
i
am
always
there
when
you
play
listening
i
wanted
you
to
know
it
oh
i
so
glad
cried
marcia
delightedly
i
it
would
please
you
i
play
more
than
ever
now
i
do
all
my
practising
there
too
cecily
said
janet
abruptly
venturing
on
personal
ground
for
the
first
time
you
are
very
lonely
there
in
that
big
house
with
no
other
young
folks
are
you
yes
answered
cecily
speaking
very
low
and
glancing
in
an
uncertain
way
at
the
gate
well
why
do
you
ask
er
miss
benedict
if
you
could
run
in
and
visit
us
once
in
a
while
or
go
out
for
a
walk
with
us
sometimes
surely
she
would
object
to
that
oh
no
no
cried
cecily
hastily
i
oh
i
love
to
but
but
it
would
do
it
would
be
allowed
no
i
must
not
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
at
least
then
added
marcia
you
let
us
know
if
you
need
anything
else
you
signal
to
us
yes
said
cecily
i
do
that
she
got
out
the
key
and
unlocked
the
gate
then
she
faced
them
with
a
sudden
passionate
sob
you
are
so
wonderfully
good
to
me
i
love
you
both
you
all
i
have
to
care
for
then
the
gate
was
shut
and
they
heard
her
footsteps
fleeing
up
the
pathway
chapter
vi
cecily
reveals
herself
that
night
the
two
girls
held
a
council
of
war
it
perfectly
plain
to
me
said
marcia
that
that
poor
little
thing
is
right
under
miss
benedict
thumb
i
think
the
way
she
treated
is
scandalous
not
allowed
to
go
out
or
speak
to
or
associate
with
any
one
and
scared
out
of
her
wits
all
the
time
evidently
what
on
earth
is
she
there
for
anyhow
janet
scorned
to
reply
to
the
old
unanswerable
question
instead
she
remarked
she
breaking
her
heart
about
it
too
i
can
see
that
and
marcia
was
it
strange
what
she
said
just
at
the
last
that
she
loved
us
and
that
we
were
all
she
had
to
care
for
where
all
her
relatives
and
family
be
miss
benedict
certainly
ca
be
a
relative
for
cecily
calls
her
to
think
of
that
lovely
little
thing
without
a
soul
to
care
for
her
except
ourselves
why
marcia
it
it
amazing
but
the
main
question
now
is
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
we
help
her
somehow
i
know
what
going
to
do
about
it
replied
marcia
decisively
i
going
to
tell
aunt
minerva
about
it
and
see
if
she
ca
wait
a
minute
janet
reminded
her
you
forget
that
cecily
fairly
begged
us
not
to
mention
anything
about
her
to
any
one
that
so
said
marcia
looking
blank
what
we
going
to
do
then
there
only
one
thing
i
can
think
of
answered
janet
slowly
miss
benedict
may
forbid
cecily
to
meet
or
speak
to
but
she
forbid
us
meeting
and
speaking
to
cecily
can
she
so
why
ca
we
just
watch
for
cecily
to
come
out
and
then
go
and
join
her
she
ca
stop
us
she
ca
help
herself
and
between
you
and
me
i
think
she
be
only
too
delighted
good
enough
laughed
marcia
but
what
an
ogre
that
miss
benedict
must
be
i
horribly
disappointed
about
her
after
i
heard
her
speak
that
time
i
was
sure
she
must
be
lovely
it
does
seem
possible
that
any
one
with
such
a
wonderful
sympathetic
voice
could
be
so
so
downright
hateful
to
a
dear
little
thing
like
cecily
i
must
say
it
seems
just
horrid
cried
janet
vehemently
that
night
after
darkness
had
fallen
the
two
girls
settling
themselves
without
a
light
at
their
open
window
heard
as
marcia
had
once
before
described
the
sound
of
running
feet
in
the
garden
beyond
the
wall
this
time
there
was
no
doubt
in
their
minds
about
it
it
was
certainly
cecily
taking
a
little
exercise
probably
on
the
deserted
path
i
wonder
why
she
marveled
marcia
should
feel
like
running
around
there
all
by
myself
i
think
i
can
understand
though
added
janet
she
cooped
up
all
day
in
that
dreary
old
place
and
probably
has
to
keep
awfully
quiet
i
go
crazy
if
i
were
shut
in
like
that
i
feel
like
like
jumping
hurdles
when
i
got
out
of
doors
and
she
a
country
girl
too
remember
get
your
violin
marcia
and
play
something
i
know
it
will
comfort
her
to
know
we
near
by
and
thinking
of
her
so
marcia
brought
her
violin
and
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
night
floated
the
dreamy
tender
melody
of
the
träumerei
the
romance
of
the
situation
appealed
to
her
and
she
played
it
as
she
never
had
before
at
the
first
notes
the
running
footsteps
ceased
and
there
was
silence
in
the
garden
when
the
music
ended
they
thought
they
could
distinguish
a
soft
little
sound
half
sigh
half
sob
from
the
velvet
blackness
below
but
they
could
not
be
sure
and
a
little
later
came
the
click
of
a
closing
door
marcia
put
down
her
violin
the
lonely
lonely
little
thing
she
exclaimed
half
under
her
breath
for
two
days
thereafter
they
maintained
a
constant
but
fruitless
vigil
over
benedict
folly
cecily
did
not
appear
either
at
her
window
or
on
a
marketing
expedition
neither
was
there
any
sound
of
her
footsteps
in
the
garden
at
night
the
girls
began
to
worry
could
it
be
that
miss
benedict
had
discovered
the
truth
about
the
remedy
for
her
sprained
ankle
and
had
perhaps
shut
cecily
up
in
close
confinement
or
even
sent
her
away
altogether
they
were
by
this
time
at
a
loss
as
to
just
what
to
think
of
that
mysterious
lady
on
the
third
afternoon
however
to
their
intense
relief
they
saw
cecily
emerge
from
the
house
and
walk
toward
the
gate
with
the
on
her
arm
it
took
them
just
about
a
minute
and
a
half
to
reach
the
street
cecily
came
abreast
of
their
own
in
due
time
her
eyes
cast
down
as
usual
but
they
were
waiting
in
the
vestibule
and
she
did
not
see
them
she
was
well
in
advance
but
still
in
sight
when
they
came
down
the
steps
and
strolled
in
the
same
direction
it
was
not
till
they
had
turned
the
corner
that
they
raced
after
her
and
at
last
breathless
caught
up
with
her
oh
she
exclaimed
with
a
little
start
i
i
did
not
expect
to
see
you
i
you
must
come
with
me
in
spite
of
her
words
however
it
was
evident
that
she
was
really
delighted
by
their
unexpected
appearance
look
here
cecily
began
marcia
why
ca
we
join
you
when
you
go
to
market
or
are
doing
your
errands
oh
that
would
be
lovely
answered
cecily
only
miss
benedict
usually
asks
me
when
i
come
in
whether
i
have
met
or
spoken
to
any
one
and
i
ca
tell
what
is
true
here
was
a
poser
the
girls
looked
crestfallen
no
you
ca
of
course
hesitated
janet
and
besides
that
went
on
cecily
this
is
the
last
time
i
shall
go
anyhow
because
she
very
much
better
now
the
salve
helped
her
ankle
very
much
and
she
says
she
going
out
herself
after
this
i
expect
to
get
out
again
there
was
a
moment
of
horrified
silence
after
this
blow
then
janet
no
longer
able
to
endure
the
bewilderment
burst
out
cecily
dear
please
forgive
us
if
we
seem
to
be
prying
into
your
affairs
it
only
because
we
think
so
much
of
you
but
who
miss
benedict
and
what
is
she
to
you
i
do
know
said
cecily
slowly
you
they
gasped
in
chorus
no
i
really
do
it
must
seem
very
strange
to
you
and
it
does
to
me
miss
benedict
is
a
perfect
stranger
to
me
and
no
relation
so
far
as
i
know
i
never
saw
or
heard
of
her
before
i
came
here
but
why
you
here
then
demanded
marcia
i
do
know
it
all
a
mystery
to
me
but
i
so
lonely
i
cried
myself
to
sleep
many
a
night
wo
you
tell
us
all
about
it
begged
marcia
we
your
friends
cecily
you
say
the
only
ones
you
have
and
we
do
ask
just
out
of
curiosity
but
because
we
interested
in
you
and
and
love
you
well
i
will
then
agreed
the
girl
as
they
walked
along
i
just
tell
you
how
it
all
happened
ever
since
i
can
remember
anything
lived
in
cranby
a
little
village
in
england
mother
and
i
lived
there
together
we
never
went
anywhere
not
even
up
to
london
because
she
was
never
very
strong
father
was
dead
he
died
when
i
was
a
tiny
baby
she
told
me
we
just
had
a
happy
quiet
life
together
we
two
well
about
the
beginning
of
this
year
mother
was
suddenly
taken
very
very
ill
i
do
know
what
was
the
matter
but
i
hardly
had
time
to
call
in
a
neighbor
and
then
bring
the
doctor
cecily
paused
and
choked
down
a
rising
sob
she
she
just
slipped
away
before
we
knew
it
she
went
on
very
low
marcia
pressed
her
hand
in
wordless
sympathy
presently
cecily
continued
afterward
the
neighbor
waddington
told
me
that
while
i
was
fetching
the
doctor
mother
had
begged
her
to
see
that
if
she
recover
i
should
be
taken
over
to
new
york
and
left
with
a
family
named
benedict
and
she
had
waddington
write
down
the
address
but
just
then
mother
grew
so
much
worse
that
she
could
explain
why
i
was
to
be
taken
there
or
what
they
were
to
me
or
i
to
them
after
it
was
all
over
we
searched
everywhere
hoping
to
find
some
papers
or
letters
or
something
that
would
tell
but
we
found
nothing
so
waddington
kept
me
with
her
for
two
or
three
months
then
a
friend
of
hers
a
bidwell
was
going
to
the
states
and
it
was
arranged
that
i
should
go
in
her
care
about
two
weeks
before
we
sailed
bidwell
wrote
to
the
benedict
family
saying
she
was
bringing
me
to
new
york
so
we
sailed
from
liverpool
and
the
very
day
we
landed
bidwell
brought
me
here
we
rang
the
old
bell
at
the
gate
and
then
waited
and
waited
i
thought
no
one
would
ever
come
but
at
last
the
gate
opened
and
miss
benedict
stood
there
in
her
hat
and
veil
she
acted
very
strangely
from
the
first
bidwell
told
her
all
about
me
and
she
never
said
a
single
word
but
only
shook
her
head
several
times
i
thought
she
was
certainly
going
to
refuse
to
take
me
in
her
manner
was
so
odd
after
she
had
stood
thinking
a
long
time
she
suddenly
said
to
me
then
and
to
bidwell
thank
you
and
she
led
me
inside
followed
by
the
driver
with
my
box
and
shut
the
gate
cecily
stopped
short
as
if
that
were
the
end
of
the
story
oh
but
go
on
stammered
marcia
quivering
with
impatience
but
i
must
do
my
marketing
now
said
cecily
here
we
are
at
the
shop
i
tell
you
the
rest
when
we
come
out
chapter
vii
surprises
all
around
how
long
have
you
been
in
new
york
began
janet
when
at
last
they
emerged
from
the
little
shop
about
two
months
said
cecily
and
i
lived
in
that
place
all
this
time
and
have
not
known
why
miss
benedict
has
never
explained
she
acts
toward
me
as
if
i
were
a
lodger
or
or
some
one
she
allowed
to
stay
there
for
reasons
of
her
own
but
did
particularly
want
to
have
about
she
kind
to
me
but
never
friendly
sometimes
she
looks
at
me
in
the
strangest
way
i
ca
imagine
what
she
thinking
about
but
why
does
she
live
like
this
and
she
turned
inquiring
eyes
on
the
girls
i
sure
do
know
exclaimed
marcia
we
only
wonder
about
it
the
house
seems
to
be
all
shut
up
why
it
cecily
enlightened
them
and
it
makes
it
so
dark
and
gloomy
there
is
lovely
furniture
in
the
but
it
is
all
covered
over
with
some
brown
stuff
even
the
pictures
and
most
of
the
other
rooms
are
not
used
at
all
nothing
on
the
ground
floor
i
eat
down
in
the
basement
and
my
bedroom
is
on
the
top
floor
where
i
looked
out
that
time
i
have
never
been
in
any
of
the
other
bedrooms
except
miss
benedict
when
her
ankle
was
bad
but
what
do
you
do
with
yourself
all
day
asked
janet
i
keep
my
room
in
order
and
help
miss
benedict
whenever
she
lets
me
of
course
she
prepares
all
the
food
herself
but
in
such
a
pretty
dainty
way
but
there
are
a
good
many
hours
when
the
time
hangs
so
heavy
on
my
hands
sometimes
she
lets
me
dust
the
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
she
keeps
everything
very
very
neat
even
if
it
is
all
covered
up
and
never
used
the
rest
of
the
time
i
sit
in
my
room
and
read
the
few
books
i
brought
with
me
and
tell
myself
long
stories
or
listen
to
your
music
i
dare
not
now
even
peep
through
the
shutters
once
i
opened
them
when
you
were
playing
but
miss
benedict
came
in
just
then
and
forbade
me
to
do
it
again
does
she
ever
let
you
go
out
and
take
a
walk
or
get
a
little
exercise
questioned
marcia
no
the
only
times
i
have
gone
out
have
been
just
lately
when
her
ankle
has
been
so
bad
at
night
after
it
is
dark
she
lets
me
run
about
the
garden
a
bit
but
never
in
the
daytime
but
how
did
she
find
out
about
your
knowing
broke
in
janet
why
of
course
i
told
her
that
first
time
after
you
were
so
good
to
me
all
about
meeting
you
and
how
lovely
you
were
to
me
i
thought
she
be
so
glad
i
found
such
nice
friends
but
she
looked
so
queer
almost
frightened
and
she
said
must
not
speak
to
them
again
it
was
kind
of
them
to
help
you
but
you
must
not
encourage
them
in
any
way
remember
child
and
i
was
only
trying
to
obey
her
when
i
passed
you
without
looking
up
the
second
time
i
went
out
cecily
said
marcia
suddenly
what
does
miss
benedict
look
like
anyhow
do
you
ever
see
her
without
that
veil
is
she
very
old
and
plain
why
no
answered
cecily
simply
she
very
beautiful
they
gasped
in
chorus
yes
i
was
surprised
too
that
day
i
came
after
the
driver
had
brought
my
box
into
the
hall
she
would
let
him
take
it
any
farther
and
she
had
shut
the
door
behind
him
and
we
were
left
alone
she
seemed
to
to
hesitate
but
at
last
she
raised
her
hands
and
took
off
her
bonnet
and
veil
i
do
know
what
i
expected
but
i
was
surprised
to
see
such
a
lovely
face
her
hair
is
gray
almost
white
and
so
soft
and
wavy
and
yet
she
has
rosy
cheeks
and
white
teeth
and
the
most
beautiful
big
gray
eyes
and
her
voice
is
very
sweet
too
do
you
know
i
believe
if
she
only
me
i
could
just
love
her
but
she
holds
me
off
as
if
she
were
somehow
of
me
it
all
very
strange
the
girls
were
completely
nonplussed
by
this
latest
bit
of
information
and
found
it
hard
to
couple
cecily
attractive
picture
with
the
little
and
veiled
figure
that
they
knew
as
miss
benedict
the
voice
alone
tallied
and
marcia
recounted
how
she
had
once
met
miss
benedict
in
the
little
suddenly
however
she
was
struck
by
a
new
thought
and
demanded
but
how
about
the
other
one
cecily
opened
her
eyes
wide
other
one
she
queried
oh
you
mean
the
other
person
in
the
house
why
yes
said
marcia
the
other
old
lady
who
sits
in
the
room
on
the
second
floor
oh
it
an
old
lady
inquired
cecily
in
surprise
why
of
course
did
you
know
it
exclaimed
marcia
i
knew
there
was
one
in
there
some
invalid
for
miss
benedict
has
always
warned
me
to
be
very
quiet
in
going
by
that
door
because
some
one
was
ill
in
there
but
she
never
told
me
who
it
was
nor
anything
more
about
her
she
always
waits
on
her
herself
even
when
her
ankle
was
hurting
her
so
she
would
drag
herself
out
of
bed
many
times
a
day
to
go
into
that
room
but
tell
me
how
did
know
there
was
an
old
lady
in
there
then
marcia
recounted
what
she
had
seen
on
the
night
the
wind
tore
open
the
shutter
how
strange
this
all
is
she
ended
that
miss
benedict
should
never
tell
you
who
this
person
is
why
do
you
suppose
she
is
keeping
it
a
secret
as
this
was
a
problem
none
of
them
could
solve
they
could
only
conjecture
vainly
about
it
as
they
walked
along
but
by
this
time
they
had
approached
within
a
block
of
the
house
itself
and
before
they
turned
the
corner
once
more
they
all
unconsciously
halted
cecily
said
marcia
suddenly
inspired
with
a
bright
idea
i
have
the
grandest
scheme
if
miss
benedict
is
going
to
do
the
marketing
after
this
perhaps
we
wo
see
you
again
for
some
time
but
i
a
plan
by
which
we
can
from
each
other
as
often
as
we
like
you
take
a
walk
in
the
garden
every
night
do
you
no
not
always
answered
cecily
miss
benedict
allows
me
to
but
often
i
do
care
to
it
so
dark
and
and
lonesome
well
after
this
be
sure
to
go
out
every
night
our
window
you
know
is
directly
over
the
garden
wall
only
three
stories
up
i
going
to
have
a
long
string
with
a
weight
attached
to
it
and
fasten
it
in
the
window
every
night
after
dark
we
write
a
note
to
you
fasten
it
to
the
string
and
drop
it
down
into
the
garden
among
the
bushes
you
can
find
it
in
the
dark
by
feeling
for
the
string
and
if
you
have
one
written
to
us
you
can
fasten
it
on
and
we
pull
it
up
is
that
a
dandy
idea
cecily
eyes
sparkled
for
a
moment
but
suddenly
her
face
clouded
oh
it
it
would
be
glorious
she
murmured
only
i
must
not
even
if
miss
benedict
does
know
about
it
i
know
she
would
forbid
it
if
she
did
so
it
would
be
wrong
for
me
to
do
it
oh
cecily
why
should
you
care
cried
marcia
impatiently
and
why
should
she
object
to
three
girls
sending
little
notes
to
one
another
it
would
be
cruel
to
forbid
that
it
is
really
wrong
you
know
but
she
is
cruel
to
me
cecily
interrupted
you
must
think
that
she
well
somehow
i
feel
she
be
nice
to
me
only
something
is
holding
her
back
she
is
a
bit
cruel
i
sometimes
feel
as
if
i
could
care
for
her
in
spite
of
everything
so
i
do
want
to
go
against
her
wishes
well
then
began
janet
here
a
way
out
of
it
we
will
write
to
anyway
miss
benedict
ca
forbid
us
to
do
that
and
you
answer
at
all
need
even
read
them
if
you
do
want
to
but
write
nevertheless
and
you
ca
prevent
it
when
cecily
smiled
her
face
lit
up
as
if
touched
by
a
shaft
of
sunlight
and
she
smiled
now
i
do
believe
i
to
read
them
she
said
but
oh
it
would
keep
me
from
being
so
very
lonely
but
i
must
be
going
back
now
been
longer
than
usual
cecily
was
still
smiling
as
she
turned
away
while
janet
and
marcia
stood
looking
after
her
waving
farewell
to
her
as
she
rounded
the
corner
chapter
viii
at
the
end
of
the
string
it
was
past
midnight
that
night
before
the
two
girls
could
settle
themselves
for
a
wink
of
sleep
so
bewildering
had
been
revelations
about
herself
and
miss
benedict
and
the
conditions
in
the
mysterious
house
that
they
found
inexhaustible
food
for
discussion
and
conjecture
the
most
interesting
question
of
course
was
the
absorbing
mystery
of
how
cecily
came
to
be
there
at
all
why
should
her
mother
have
sent
her
there
demanded
marcia
for
the
twentieth
time
perhaps
she
was
a
relative
ventured
janet
that
perfect
nonsense
argued
marcia
for
then
miss
benedict
would
surely
have
acted
quite
differently
if
she
had
been
the
most
distant
connection
miss
benedict
would
surely
have
told
her
no
i
should
say
she
might
be
the
child
of
a
friend
that
miss
benedict
never
cared
particularly
about
and
yet
she
does
quite
like
to
send
her
away
is
it
a
puzzle
but
what
you
think
of
miss
benedict
being
i
ca
imagine
it
and
then
too
think
of
cecily
not
knowing
there
was
another
old
lady
in
the
house
added
janet
what
a
darling
cecily
is
exclaimed
marcia
irrelevantly
if
miss
benedict
knew
how
sweet
and
loyal
and
obedient
cecily
is
she
be
a
little
less
strict
with
her
i
sure
i
suppose
she
does
want
her
to
gossip
about
what
goes
on
in
that
queer
house
and
by
the
way
we
must
get
our
string
in
working
order
let
send
her
other
things
beside
notes
too
things
she
enjoy
and
until
they
fell
asleep
they
planned
the
campaign
for
lightening
the
lonely
hours
of
the
girl
next
door
illustration
they
heard
cecily
light
footsteps
next
day
they
jointly
wrote
a
long
letter
telling
all
about
themselves
their
homes
their
schools
their
studies
and
any
other
items
they
thought
might
interest
her
fastened
it
to
the
end
of
the
string
and
dropped
it
into
the
dark
garden
after
nightfall
later
they
heard
cecily
light
footsteps
in
the
gloom
below
and
when
they
pulled
up
the
string
just
before
they
went
to
bed
the
note
was
gone
well
she
evidently
decided
that
it
would
be
all
right
for
her
to
take
it
said
janet
and
i
relieved
even
if
she
does
answer
i
can
see
why
she
might
think
it
right
to
do
and
now
we
must
plan
to
send
her
something
besides
every
once
in
a
while
i
should
think
she
just
die
of
lonesomeness
in
that
old
place
and
with
hardly
a
thing
to
do
either
that
night
they
sent
her
down
a
little
box
of
fudge
that
they
had
made
in
the
afternoon
and
the
next
night
a
book
that
had
captivated
them
both
and
when
they
pulled
up
the
string
the
evening
after
there
was
the
book
again
and
in
it
a
tiny
note
which
ran
dear
girls
you
are
too
too
good
to
me
i
ought
not
to
be
writing
this
it
is
wrong
i
fear
but
i
just
can
not
sleep
until
i
have
thanked
you
for
the
sweets
and
this
beautiful
book
i
read
it
all
you
are
making
me
very
happy
i
love
you
both
cecily
meantime
they
had
seen
miss
benedict
go
in
and
out
once
or
twice
limping
slightly
and
had
watched
her
veiled
figure
with
absorbed
interest
who
could
possibly
imagine
her
as
beautiful
they
marveled
and
truly
it
was
an
effort
of
imagination
to
connect
beauty
with
the
queer
oddly
arrayed
little
figure
also
at
various
times
during
each
day
marcia
made
a
point
of
giving
a
little
violin
concert
at
her
window
and
at
janet
suggestion
had
chosen
the
liveliest
and
most
cheerful
music
in
her
repertoire
for
sad
little
cecily
entertainment
the
two
girls
likewise
exhausted
every
possibility
in
the
line
of
small
gifts
and
tiny
trifles
to
amuse
and
entertain
their
young
neighbor
but
there
was
no
further
communication
from
her
till
one
night
after
they
had
sent
down
an
embroidery
ring
and
silks
the
latest
pattern
of
a
dainty
and
elaborate
instructions
how
to
embroider
it
next
night
there
was
a
note
on
the
end
of
the
string
when
they
drew
it
up
it
read
how
dear
of
you
to
send
me
this
i
to
embroider
and
had
brought
no
materials
with
me
and
now
i
want
to
ask
you
a
question
do
you
mind
what
i
do
with
it
after
it
is
finished
is
it
my
very
own
what
can
i
ever
do
to
repay
you
for
all
your
kindness
in
their
answer
they
assured
her
that
she
could
make
any
use
of
the
that
pleased
her
and
then
they
spent
much
time
wondering
what
use
she
going
to
make
of
it
two
nights
later
when
they
pulled
up
the
string
they
found
to
their
surprise
a
small
parcel
attached
to
the
end
it
contained
a
little
box
in
which
lay
wrapped
in
jeweler
cotton
a
tiny
coral
pendant
in
an
gold
setting
and
a
silver
bracelet
of
thin
the
pendant
was
labeled
for
marcia
with
cecily
love
and
the
bracelet
for
janet
with
love
from
cecily
the
two
girls
gazed
at
the
pathetic
little
gifts
and
sudden
tears
came
into
their
eyes
oh
jan
half
sobbed
marcia
we
ought
to
keep
them
probably
the
only
trinkets
she
has
but
janet
was
wiser
we
must
keep
them
she
decided
cecily
want
all
the
giving
to
be
on
one
side
and
she
has
probably
been
longing
to
do
something
for
us
i
suppose
these
are
the
only
things
she
had
that
would
be
suitable
much
as
i
hate
to
have
her
deprive
herself
of
them
i
know
she
be
terribly
hurt
if
we
sent
them
back
we
must
write
her
the
best
letter
of
thanks
we
can
so
the
days
went
by
for
two
or
three
weeks
the
girls
caught
in
all
this
time
not
so
much
as
one
glimpse
of
cecily
but
they
managed
thanks
to
their
line
of
communication
to
keep
constantly
in
touch
with
her
meantime
the
summer
weather
waxed
hotter
and
hotter
and
the
city
fairly
steamed
under
the
july
sun
their
own
time
was
taken
up
by
many
diversions
trips
to
the
parks
beaches
and
zoo
excursions
out
of
town
with
aunt
minerva
shopping
and
quiet
sewing
or
reading
in
their
pleasant
every
time
they
went
out
of
their
home
on
a
they
felt
guilty
to
think
of
the
lonely
little
prisoner
cooped
up
in
the
dreary
house
next
door
and
both
declared
they
would
gladly
give
up
their
places
to
her
had
such
a
thing
been
possible
then
one
night
something
unusual
occurred
they
had
sent
down
the
usual
note
and
also
a
little
of
the
souvenir
of
a
recent
trip
to
the
seaside
to
their
astonishment
when
they
drew
up
the
string
both
note
and
basket
were
still
attached
this
was
the
first
time
such
a
thing
had
happened
what
be
the
matter
queried
marcia
can
it
be
possible
that
cecily
feels
she
must
do
this
any
more
did
hear
any
footsteps
down
there
did
you
said
janet
no
come
to
think
of
it
i
did
she
must
have
stayed
indoors
for
the
first
time
since
we
began
this
but
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
reason
janet
suddenly
clutched
her
friend
marcia
can
it
be
possible
that
miss
benedict
has
discovered
what
we
been
doing
and
wo
let
her
come
out
any
more
i
believe
that
it
marcia
voice
was
sharp
with
consternation
would
it
be
dreadful
if
it
so
they
sat
gloomily
thinking
it
over
well
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it
demanded
marcia
wait
till
night
and
try
again
counseled
janet
it
just
possible
cecily
had
a
headache
or
felt
sick
from
this
abominable
heat
and
could
come
down
let
see
what
happens
the
next
night
they
tied
the
basket
and
another
note
to
the
string
and
dropped
it
down
hopefully
but
they
drew
it
up
untouched
precisely
the
same
as
before
it
just
one
of
two
things
decided
marcia
either
cecily
is
ill
or
miss
benedict
has
found
out
about
our
little
plan
and
forbidden
cecily
to
go
on
with
it
what
are
we
to
do
keep
on
sending
notes
or
stop
it
suppose
miss
benedict
herself
should
find
one
sometime
i
do
care
cried
janet
decisively
if
cecily
is
ill
she
get
better
pretty
soon
and
come
out
some
night
and
there
be
nothing
for
her
she
be
dreadfully
disappointed
i
do
care
if
there
the
possibility
that
miss
benedict
knows
all
about
it
i
going
to
keep
right
on
writing
and
take
the
chance
for
a
whole
week
they
followed
their
usual
program
nightly
sending
down
a
fresh
note
that
they
always
later
drew
up
unclaimed
and
as
the
days
passed
they
became
more
and
more
alarmed
something
had
certainly
happened
to
cecily
of
that
they
were
sure
and
their
misgivings
grew
more
keen
with
the
passing
time
can
it
be
that
she
is
there
any
more
conjectured
marcia
suddenly
one
day
perhaps
miss
benedict
has
sent
her
away
this
was
a
new
and
startling
possibility
the
more
they
contemplated
it
the
more
depressed
they
grew
if
that
were
the
case
then
they
might
never
see
cecily
again
and
the
delightful
and
curious
friendship
would
be
ended
forever
their
usual
good
spirits
were
quite
subdued
and
even
their
hearty
appetites
suffered
somewhat
which
worried
aunt
minerva
not
a
little
though
she
attributed
it
to
the
heat
finally
one
night
precisely
one
week
after
the
first
unclaimed
communication
they
sent
down
the
usual
letter
begging
cecily
if
possible
to
let
them
know
what
was
the
matter
it
seemed
to
both
during
the
interval
they
left
it
there
that
they
heard
light
almost
stealthy
footsteps
in
the
garden
below
but
neither
felt
certain
about
it
an
hour
later
they
drew
up
the
string
their
own
note
was
still
attached
to
it
at
the
bottom
but
just
above
it
they
saw
fastened
a
little
scrap
of
paper
no
bigger
than
a
quarter
of
an
ordinary
both
girls
started
with
delight
quick
cried
marcia
cecily
has
answered
at
last
oh
i
so
glad
janet
unfastened
it
her
fingers
trembling
with
excitement
and
spread
it
out
on
the
table
it
was
not
in
cecily
handwriting
and
contained
but
a
few
words
both
girls
read
it
at
a
glance
and
then
stared
into
each
other
eyes
half
half
amazed
for
this
is
what
it
said
will
you
please
come
to
the
gate
morning
at
nine
benedict
chapter
ix
for
the
sake
of
cecily
what
it
mean
muttered
janet
what
does
she
want
of
us
why
it
perfectly
plain
declared
marcia
she
has
discovered
that
we
have
been
trying
to
correspond
with
cecily
and
she
going
to
demand
an
explanation
probably
warn
us
that
we
must
stop
it
are
you
afraid
to
go
janet
not
i
why
should
i
be
miss
benedict
ca
do
or
say
a
thing
to
harm
but
i
anxious
for
poor
little
cecily
i
just
hate
to
think
we
may
have
brought
trouble
on
her
oh
i
wish
now
we
never
suggested
such
a
thing
moaned
marcia
we
just
succeeded
in
making
that
poor
little
thing
miserable
i
suppose
well
we
can
only
remember
that
we
to
make
her
happy
and
we
for
a
while
at
least
comforted
janet
and
what
more
not
going
to
worry
about
it
another
bit
maybe
it
something
entirely
different
anyway
marcia
however
could
not
bring
herself
to
this
cheerful
view
of
things
all
night
long
she
tossed
beside
the
sleeping
janet
wondering
and
wondering
about
what
the
coming
interview
might
mean
and
blaming
herself
a
thousand
times
for
placing
cecily
in
the
position
of
having
deceived
her
guardian
when
morning
came
she
was
pale
and
which
alarmed
her
aunt
not
a
little
you
ought
not
go
out
this
morning
marcia
remarked
miss
minerva
anxiously
the
sun
is
very
hot
and
you
look
as
if
you
had
a
headache
oh
no
i
have
aunty
cried
marcia
eagerly
fearful
of
a
hitch
in
their
plans
i
did
sleep
very
well
but
a
walk
in
the
fresh
air
will
do
me
good
i
know
and
so
miss
minerva
saw
them
go
without
further
protest
they
both
halted
at
the
gate
in
the
brick
wall
and
looked
into
each
other
eyes
the
hot
morning
sun
beat
down
upon
them
as
they
stood
there
and
eyed
them
curiously
each
was
perfectly
certain
that
the
thumping
of
her
heart
could
be
heard
and
still
they
stood
hesitating
you
afraid
accused
janet
i
not
protested
marcia
and
i
prove
it
she
raised
her
hand
suddenly
and
pulled
the
rusty
it
seemed
a
long
long
time
before
there
was
any
response
but
at
last
they
heard
the
click
of
the
opening
front
door
and
the
sound
of
footsteps
on
the
path
this
was
followed
by
the
creaking
of
a
key
turning
in
the
lock
of
the
gate
janet
gripped
marcia
by
the
hand
and
with
pounding
hearts
they
stood
together
while
the
gate
slowly
opened
in
another
instant
the
veiled
figure
of
miss
benedict
stood
before
them
she
waited
a
moment
silent
appearing
to
look
them
over
critically
come
in
if
you
please
she
said
at
last
very
softly
and
held
the
gate
open
for
them
they
entered
obediently
and
she
shut
the
gate
it
was
not
until
they
were
inside
the
house
standing
in
the
dim
hall
with
the
front
door
closed
behind
them
that
another
word
was
spoken
then
miss
benedict
faced
them
again
but
she
did
not
remove
her
bonnet
or
throw
back
her
veil
i
have
asked
you
to
come
here
this
morning
she
began
because
i
understand
that
you
have
become
acquainted
with
the
child
cecily
marlowe
cold
chills
ran
up
and
down
their
spines
it
had
come
at
last
yes
faltered
janet
we
we
become
acquainted
with
her
it
was
not
a
brilliant
reply
but
for
the
life
of
her
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
they
waited
shuddering
for
what
might
be
coming
next
so
she
has
told
me
went
on
miss
benedict
i
also
understand
that
lately
you
have
been
dropping
notes
to
her
into
the
garden
at
night
janet
noticed
even
in
the
midst
of
her
trepidation
how
wonderfully
sweet
and
soft
and
harmonious
the
voice
was
yes
replied
marcia
very
low
we
have
the
worst
was
out
now
let
the
blow
fall
they
braced
themselves
to
receive
it
cecily
is
ill
said
miss
benedict
abruptly
they
each
uttered
a
startled
little
oh
she
has
not
been
at
all
well
for
over
a
week
the
lovely
voice
continued
i
am
very
much
worried
about
her
janet
and
marcia
glanced
into
each
other
eyes
in
astonishment
cecily
ill
and
miss
benedict
actually
about
it
here
were
surprises
indeed
oh
i
hope
it
nothing
serious
exclaimed
marcia
anxiously
i
hope
it
is
not
and
i
it
is
probably
only
the
hot
weather
and
and
want
of
exercise
miss
benedict
hesitated
a
little
over
the
last
she
has
been
so
poorly
and
has
has
evidently
been
so
anxious
to
to
see
you
that
i
thought
i
would
surprise
her
by
asking
you
to
come
and
visit
her
a
while
it
was
plainly
a
struggle
for
miss
benedict
to
make
this
seem
the
natural
normal
thing
to
do
will
you
come
up
to
her
room
the
girls
were
almost
too
stunned
at
the
turn
events
had
taken
to
reply
why
we
be
glad
to
faltered
marcia
at
last
then
if
you
will
follow
me
miss
benedict
led
the
way
through
the
dark
halls
and
up
three
pairs
of
stairs
at
the
door
of
a
room
on
the
fourth
floor
she
paused
knocked
and
then
entered
they
followed
dimly
perceiving
a
little
form
in
the
bed
for
the
shutters
of
course
were
closed
as
they
entered
after
miss
benedict
cecily
sprang
to
a
sitting
posture
with
a
cry
of
mingled
wonder
consternation
and
joy
she
too
glanced
uncertainly
at
miss
benedict
i
have
asked
your
friends
to
come
and
and
see
you
for
a
while
she
explained
hesitatingly
to
the
bewildered
child
perhaps
it
will
make
you
feel
better
then
she
turned
abruptly
and
went
out
of
the
room
closing
the
door
after
her
for
a
moment
they
stared
at
one
another
cecily
cried
janet
at
length
what
this
all
mean
anyway
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
as
seeing
you
here
faltered
the
invalid
what
made
her
do
it
demanded
marcia
we
found
a
note
from
her
tied
to
our
string
how
did
she
know
about
it
cecily
seemed
to
shrink
back
at
this
piece
of
news
i
told
her
myself
she
said
i
was
very
sick
one
night
i
think
i
had
a
fever
my
head
was
so
hot
and
ached
so
and
she
was
oh
so
good
to
me
i
could
hardly
believe
it
she
bathed
my
head
and
sat
by
me
and
put
her
cool
hands
on
my
forehead
it
really
seemed
as
if
she
cared
and
i
felt
so
ashamed
to
think
i
disobeyed
her
that
i
just
told
her
right
out
all
about
it
how
lonely
i
been
and
how
good
you
were
to
me
and
how
enjoyed
hearing
from
you
and
what
did
she
say
breathed
marcia
in
an
whisper
not
a
word
except
mind
now
little
girl
and
she
never
said
a
thing
more
about
it
i
did
dream
that
she
ever
do
such
a
thing
as
for
you
to
come
and
see
me
they
marveled
over
it
all
a
moment
in
silence
then
marcia
burst
out
oh
cecily
we
been
worried
about
you
we
could
think
why
you
did
even
take
the
letters
any
more
have
you
been
very
ill
why
i
do
know
i
just
feel
horrid
most
of
the
time
my
head
aches
a
lot
and
every
once
in
a
while
i
awfully
cold
and
then
i
seem
to
be
burning
up
why
i
believe
you
must
have
malaria
interrupted
marcia
that
what
aunt
minerva
has
sometimes
you
ought
to
go
out
more
and
have
fresh
air
and
sunshine
she
stopped
suddenly
remembering
the
conditions
but
anyway
it
is
serious
she
hurried
on
after
an
embarrassed
pause
and
you
ought
to
have
some
quinine
i
wonder
if
miss
benedict
would
let
us
get
it
for
you
i
ask
her
later
then
they
hurried
on
to
tell
her
how
they
had
continued
to
send
down
a
note
every
night
hoping
that
she
would
get
it
and
how
they
had
feared
that
she
might
have
gone
away
and
cecily
in
return
told
them
how
she
had
enjoyed
the
notes
and
gifts
but
how
guilty
she
had
always
felt
about
receiving
them
especially
when
she
had
answered
them
and
i
finished
embroidering
the
she
ended
and
and
i
gave
it
to
miss
benedict
you
they
both
gasped
oh
i
you
do
mind
exclaimed
cecily
hastily
but
but
i
felt
as
if
i
wanted
to
something
for
her
she
i
i
think
getting
to
like
her
more
and
more
what
did
she
say
asked
marcia
was
she
pleased
i
ca
imagine
her
wearing
such
a
thing
she
looked
at
it
and
then
at
me
very
strangely
for
a
minute
then
she
said
you
child
i
i
never
wear
such
things
but
i
keep
it
for
your
sake
is
that
queer
exclaimed
janet
you
thought
she
cared
nothing
about
you
yes
agreed
cecily
but
lately
i
not
so
sure
in
the
pause
that
followed
the
girls
glanced
curiously
about
the
darkened
room
trying
to
realize
that
they
were
actually
inside
the
mysterious
house
at
last
it
was
a
large
square
room
furnished
with
heavy
chairs
and
an
bureau
and
bed
every
shutter
was
fastened
and
the
slats
tightly
closed
only
the
dimmest
daylight
filtered
in
the
effect
was
gloomy
and
depressing
to
the
last
degree
they
wondered
how
cecily
had
stood
it
so
long
illustration
i
going
to
ask
miss
benedict
if
we
ca
open
these
shutters
cried
janet
suddenly
i
going
to
ask
miss
benedict
if
we
ca
open
these
shutters
cried
janet
suddenly
i
should
think
you
die
of
this
gloom
it
really
bad
for
you
cecily
oh
do
exclaimed
cecily
in
consternation
i
asked
her
once
when
i
first
came
and
she
did
like
it
at
all
she
said
no
she
preferred
to
have
them
shut
and
i
must
not
touch
them
i
do
care
went
on
janet
ruthlessly
you
were
sick
then
sure
she
let
you
now
and
true
to
her
word
she
turned
to
miss
benedict
who
entered
at
this
moment
still
bonneted
and
veiled
i
believe
cecily
has
malaria
miss
benedict
she
began
bravely
but
with
inward
trepidation
oh
do
you
think
so
is
it
serious
the
melodious
voice
sounded
startled
and
concerned
i
do
think
it
so
serious
janet
continued
but
she
probably
get
over
it
quicker
if
she
had
a
lot
of
fresh
air
and
sunshine
she
have
the
shutters
open
it
would
do
her
lots
of
good
cecily
and
marcia
trembled
at
janet
temerity
and
watched
miss
benedict
with
bated
breath
but
instead
of
being
annoyed
she
only
seemed
surprised
and
relieved
why
do
you
think
so
she
queried
then
surely
they
may
be
opened
i
i
do
not
like
the
the
glare
of
so
much
daylight
myself
but
cecily
may
have
it
here
if
she
chooses
and
following
up
her
words
she
pushed
open
one
of
the
shutters
a
broad
shaft
of
sunlight
streamed
in
and
blinking
from
the
previous
gloom
janet
and
marcia
threw
open
the
others
cecily
gave
a
delighted
cry
oh
how
lovely
it
is
to
see
the
sun
again
but
miss
benedict
with
an
abrupt
exclamation
retreated
hastily
from
the
room
the
girls
stayed
a
few
moments
more
chatting
then
they
wisely
suggested
that
perhaps
they
had
better
go
and
not
tire
cecily
by
too
long
a
call
hearing
miss
benedict
footstep
in
the
hall
below
they
took
their
leave
promising
to
come
again
as
soon
as
it
seemed
best
on
the
landing
of
the
stairway
they
found
the
figure
apparently
waiting
for
them
now
during
all
the
strange
little
interview
a
curious
impression
had
been
growing
upon
janet
strengthened
by
every
word
miss
benedict
had
uttered
an
impression
that
here
was
no
grim
forbidding
jailor
such
as
they
had
imagined
the
mistress
of
benedict
folly
to
be
instead
they
had
encountered
a
gentle
almost
winning
little
person
worried
about
the
illness
of
the
child
in
her
care
and
plainly
anxious
to
do
everything
suggested
to
make
her
more
comfortable
janet
suddenly
resolved
on
a
bold
move
cecily
is
so
lonely
she
began
turning
to
miss
benedict
do
you
think
it
would
do
her
lots
of
good
to
come
in
and
visit
us
once
in
a
while
marcia
aunt
would
be
so
glad
to
see
her
as
soon
as
she
is
a
little
better
ca
she
no
interrupted
miss
benedict
her
little
figure
suddenly
stiffening
and
a
determined
note
creeping
into
her
soft
voice
i
am
sorry
cecily
can
not
make
visits
it
is
out
of
the
question
it
was
like
striking
a
hidden
rock
in
a
smooth
beautiful
sheet
of
water
and
her
words
admitted
of
no
argument
janet
and
marcia
followed
her
meekly
and
in
silence
down
to
the
front
door
here
in
an
uncertain
pause
marcia
made
one
further
suggestion
may
we
bring
cecily
some
quinine
she
ventured
if
she
has
malaria
she
ought
to
have
that
we
have
lots
of
it
at
home
it
would
be
very
kind
of
you
replied
miss
benedict
in
an
entirely
different
tone
come
and
see
her
again
if
your
aunt
will
permit
it
perhaps
it
would
be
well
to
explain
to
her
and
here
her
manner
became
confused
that
i
er
do
not
make
calls
or
or
receive
them
but
this
is
just
just
for
the
sake
of
the
child
it
was
plain
to
the
girls
that
this
admission
was
wrung
from
her
only
by
a
great
effort
she
opened
the
front
door
and
followed
them
to
the
gate
when
she
had
unlocked
it
marcia
turned
to
her
impulsively
thank
you
much
for
letting
us
come
we
are
very
very
fond
of
cecily
she
is
such
a
dear
and
we
been
terribly
worried
about
her
as
a
relative
i
afraid
you
have
been
still
more
anxious
the
black
figure
started
she
is
no
relative
of
mine
came
abruptly
from
behind
the
veil
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
should
say
stuttered
marcia
embarrassed
or
or
the
daughter
of
a
friend
perhaps
she
is
not
miss
benedict
contradicted
in
a
strange
flat
tone
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
i
do
not
know
who
she
is
nor
why
she
is
here
chapter
x
the
filigree
bracelet
aunt
minerva
took
off
her
spectacles
wiped
them
excitedly
and
put
them
on
again
and
she
said
she
did
know
who
the
child
was
or
why
she
was
there
well
i
never
she
exclaimed
adjusting
them
all
awry
marcia
had
decided
to
tell
her
aunt
all
about
it
and
janet
had
agreed
with
her
that
since
miss
benedict
had
spoken
as
she
did
there
could
be
no
further
occasion
for
secrecy
so
that
night
they
gave
her
an
entire
history
of
the
affair
and
found
her
a
willing
listener
interested
and
sympathetic
beyond
their
wildest
expectations
why
aunty
i
did
suppose
you
care
much
about
it
exclaimed
marcia
in
surprise
and
here
you
are
nearly
as
excited
over
it
as
we
been
why
who
would
not
be
said
miss
minerva
it
precisely
like
a
mystery
in
a
book
i
was
interested
in
the
old
place
at
first
because
i
was
too
busy
and
it
seemed
as
if
the
people
living
there
were
such
slack
housekeepers
i
have
any
sympathy
with
but
what
could
she
mean
by
that
last
remark
not
know
who
the
child
is
or
why
she
there
it
absurd
i
ca
believe
it
well
that
what
she
asserted
marcia
again
and
if
any
one
ever
heard
of
a
bigger
mystery
i
like
to
know
about
it
miss
minerva
took
up
her
mending
again
then
i
do
see
why
she
keeps
the
girl
she
commented
she
keeps
her
think
because
she
getting
sort
of
fond
of
her
reasoned
janet
you
can
easily
see
that
cecily
said
she
was
very
good
to
her
the
night
she
was
so
and
then
too
it
must
have
been
a
hard
pull
for
her
to
go
so
far
as
to
send
for
to
come
in
just
because
it
might
please
cecily
we
must
see
that
the
child
has
the
quinine
and
it
would
hurt
her
to
have
a
glass
or
two
of
currant
jelly
do
forget
them
when
you
go
in
miss
minerva
reminded
them
i
like
to
have
her
here
and
nurse
her
myself
and
feed
her
up
a
bit
and
that
another
strange
thing
why
should
that
woman
miss
minerva
invariably
alluded
to
miss
benedict
as
that
woman
allow
you
to
go
in
and
visit
the
child
yet
forbid
her
to
visit
you
do
ask
us
why
laughed
marcia
we
as
much
in
the
dark
as
any
one
else
what
want
to
know
is
why
did
miss
benedict
allow
cecily
to
open
her
shutters
when
she
refused
her
a
while
ago
and
why
does
she
open
them
over
all
the
rest
of
the
house
well
what
want
to
know
added
janet
is
why
cecily
mother
should
have
sent
her
over
here
to
the
benedicts
at
all
when
nobody
knew
her
or
claimed
her
whatever
made
her
think
of
such
a
thing
there
are
several
explanations
that
might
suit
such
a
case
mused
miss
minerva
marlowe
might
have
been
a
married
sister
or
some
more
distant
relative
who
then
would
miss
benedict
know
about
it
or
at
least
some
such
connection
interrupted
marcia
that
true
acknowledged
her
aunt
there
be
some
other
explanation
a
puzzle
what
more
added
janet
i
remember
that
cecily
told
us
this
when
she
first
came
miss
benedict
questioned
her
all
about
herself
where
she
came
from
and
all
that
and
after
cecily
had
told
her
she
never
said
a
word
but
just
walked
away
shaking
her
head
miss
minerva
mind
suddenly
took
a
new
turn
did
you
say
the
child
sent
you
a
couple
of
gifts
little
trinkets
not
long
ago
i
like
to
see
them
we
never
worn
them
said
marcia
it
just
seemed
as
if
we
could
she
ought
not
to
have
given
them
away
and
yet
i
know
just
how
she
felt
she
wanted
to
do
i
get
them
she
brought
the
box
and
laid
it
in
her
aunt
lap
miss
minerva
examined
the
coral
pendant
first
the
dear
little
thing
she
murmured
she
must
think
a
lot
of
you
to
have
parted
with
this
then
she
laid
it
down
and
took
up
the
bracelet
gracious
she
exclaimed
immediately
letting
it
fall
and
then
picking
it
up
again
am
i
going
crazy
or
are
my
eyes
deceiving
me
she
turned
it
over
and
over
what
the
matter
cried
both
girls
at
once
cried
miss
minerva
why
just
this
that
bracelet
is
exactly
like
one
i
had
put
away
for
years
the
girls
stared
at
her
incredulously
i
get
it
this
minute
and
prove
it
and
she
hurried
out
of
the
room
while
she
was
gone
they
examined
the
bracelet
more
closely
than
they
had
yet
done
it
consisted
of
two
thin
rims
of
silver
joined
by
silver
a
quarter
of
an
inch
wide
here
and
there
at
intervals
in
the
filigree
and
forming
part
of
the
pattern
were
several
strange
characters
looking
as
marcia
declared
like
those
on
the
receipt
from
a
chinese
laundry
the
workmanship
was
unusually
delicate
and
beautiful
in
five
minutes
miss
minerva
was
back
flushed
and
disheveled
from
a
hunt
through
several
and
boxes
i
could
find
it
at
first
she
panted
in
northam
i
used
to
be
able
to
lay
my
hand
on
anything
i
wanted
at
an
instant
notice
but
in
this
apartment
she
heaved
a
resigned
sigh
and
laid
something
beside
the
bracelet
on
the
table
it
was
the
exact
duplicate
in
every
last
detail
even
the
complicated
characters
were
identical
the
three
stared
at
the
trinkets
in
an
expressive
silence
not
for
a
moment
could
it
be
doubted
that
these
two
bracelets
were
once
a
pair
they
were
so
unusual
that
it
was
impossible
there
could
be
others
like
them
this
astonishing
fact
was
patent
to
them
all
aunt
minerva
where
you
get
yours
breathed
marcia
at
last
why
that
easily
explained
answered
miss
brett
your
father
brought
it
to
me
about
ten
or
twelve
years
ago
after
one
of
his
voyages
he
said
that
a
chinese
sailor
in
had
offered
to
sell
it
to
him
for
a
small
sum
and
seeing
it
was
a
rather
unique
little
trinket
he
bought
it
and
brought
it
home
to
me
i
never
wear
such
things
however
jewelry
never
did
appeal
to
me
and
bracelets
particularly
always
seemed
a
nuisance
so
i
put
it
away
intending
to
give
it
to
you
some
day
marcia
and
after
a
while
i
actually
forgot
all
about
it
till
janet
sat
up
very
straight
there
just
one
thing
i
give
my
head
to
know
this
minute
did
cecily
get
bracelet
well
that
you
can
easily
find
out
but
i
afraid
you
have
to
wait
till
morning
laughed
marcia
there
something
very
strange
about
this
marveled
miss
minerva
turning
the
two
trinkets
over
and
over
actually
i
can
hardly
tell
now
which
is
mine
and
which
hers
except
that
mine
is
a
little
more
tarnished
from
having
been
laid
away
your
father
said
when
he
gave
me
mine
that
he
never
seen
anything
like
it
in
any
of
those
foreign
and
that
was
why
he
been
specially
attracted
to
it
aunty
said
marcia
suddenly
where
do
you
suppose
that
sailor
got
it
your
father
said
replied
miss
minerva
that
he
probably
stolen
it
or
somebody
else
had
it
may
have
passed
through
dozens
of
hands
after
it
was
taken
from
the
original
owner
you
never
can
tell
about
such
things
in
the
east
and
it
useless
to
inquire
again
they
all
stared
hard
at
the
two
silver
trinkets
lying
side
by
side
on
the
table
and
these
two
bracelets
once
belonged
to
the
same
person
murmured
marcia
at
last
perhaps
to
some
one
connected
with
cecily
and
to
think
they
should
have
drifted
halfway
around
the
world
to
find
themselves
side
by
side
again
in
busy
practical
new
york
chapter
xi
the
lifted
veil
next
morning
marcia
and
janet
sallied
forth
to
make
their
promised
visit
to
cecily
they
were
armed
with
a
box
of
quinine
pills
two
glasses
of
currant
jelly
a
new
magazine
marcia
violin
in
its
case
and
last
but
not
least
the
two
filigree
bracelets
and
they
were
literally
bursting
with
news
and
excitement
miss
benedict
opened
the
gate
for
them
as
before
and
to
their
inquiries
replied
that
cecily
seemed
a
little
better
if
she
noticed
the
suppressed
excitement
in
their
manner
she
did
not
comment
upon
it
but
only
led
the
way
to
cecily
room
without
further
words
she
was
bonneted
and
veiled
as
usual
at
the
door
she
left
them
saying
she
would
not
go
in
cecily
cecily
cried
marcia
immediately
we
have
news
such
strange
news
for
you
cecily
was
at
once
all
eagerness
and
animation
oh
tell
me
quickly
she
exclaimed
sitting
up
in
the
bed
i
feel
so
much
better
i
going
to
get
up
but
how
can
you
have
any
news
about
me
cecily
said
janet
sitting
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
have
you
been
thinking
all
this
time
that
miss
benedict
knew
everything
about
you
and
why
you
came
here
and
all
that
why
of
course
cried
cecily
opening
her
eyes
wide
she
has
never
explained
it
to
me
and
she
so
that
i
never
liked
to
ask
her
but
i
always
thought
she
well
she
does
not
a
thing
apparently
replied
janet
and
then
repeated
to
her
all
the
strange
conversation
at
the
gate
on
the
day
before
when
she
had
finished
cecily
sat
as
if
stunned
quiet
and
rigid
and
staring
out
of
the
window
so
much
had
it
appeared
to
affect
her
that
janet
was
suddenly
sorry
she
had
said
a
word
about
it
then
what
does
it
all
mean
murmured
cecily
at
last
i
here
where
i
no
right
to
be
nobody
knows
me
or
wants
me
how
did
it
all
happen
do
i
belong
to
she
looked
so
bewildered
so
frightened
so
unhappy
that
janet
and
marcia
both
put
their
arms
about
her
it
all
right
cecily
it
to
be
all
right
in
the
end
would
love
you
and
want
you
if
nobody
else
did
and
i
sure
miss
benedict
must
care
for
you
too
she
really
acts
so
but
the
question
is
how
did
you
ever
come
to
be
sent
here
at
all
did
your
mother
ever
say
anything
to
you
about
this
place
or
any
of
the
people
over
here
no
said
cecily
in
a
hushed
voice
it
was
evident
from
her
manner
that
her
grief
over
the
loss
of
her
mother
was
very
keen
and
she
had
only
once
voluntarily
referred
to
it
or
to
anything
connected
with
it
my
mother
never
never
mentioned
the
name
of
benedict
to
me
i
never
heard
of
it
before
but
could
miss
benedict
possibly
have
been
some
connection
some
distant
connection
that
she
never
thought
of
or
mentioned
persisted
marcia
no
my
mother
people
were
all
english
declared
cecily
and
they
were
all
dead
we
had
no
relatives
living
well
your
father
then
supplemented
janet
what
about
him
i
never
knew
him
to
remember
him
mother
said
he
died
when
i
was
a
baby
a
year
or
two
old
he
had
any
relatives
either
well
here
something
else
we
have
to
tell
you
and
it
the
strangest
thing
yet
began
janet
can
you
tell
us
where
you
got
that
bracelet
cecily
the
one
you
were
so
lovely
as
to
send
to
us
why
i
always
had
it
answered
cecily
even
when
i
was
a
tiny
little
girl
and
it
was
much
too
big
for
me
it
seemed
to
be
mine
mother
kept
it
in
a
box
but
she
let
me
play
with
it
once
in
a
while
then
when
i
was
older
and
it
fitted
me
better
she
let
me
wear
it
i
she
said
my
father
gave
it
to
me
i
do
remember
very
clearly
i
believe
i
ever
thought
much
about
it
although
i
realized
it
was
rather
unusual
but
why
do
you
ask
did
she
ever
say
it
had
a
mate
that
there
was
a
pair
of
them
questioned
marcia
oh
no
i
sure
she
never
said
anything
about
another
what
do
you
think
of
this
then
marcia
drew
the
two
bracelets
out
of
her
bag
and
laid
them
side
by
side
on
the
bed
why
how
very
very
cried
cecily
incredulously
where
you
get
the
other
marcia
outlined
its
history
you
see
there
is
a
shadow
of
doubt
that
there
was
once
a
pair
of
them
she
ended
and
that
they
both
belonged
to
the
same
person
now
could
that
person
be
it
must
have
been
some
one
connected
with
you
cecily
added
janet
everything
points
that
way
well
one
thing
is
certain
if
we
could
find
out
the
truth
about
these
two
bracelets
i
believe
we
find
out
about
cecily
too
why
she
is
here
and
the
whole
mystery
all
three
were
very
silent
for
a
moment
considering
i
know
one
thing
ventured
marcia
at
length
cecily
you
must
give
this
bracelet
away
it
was
dear
and
sweet
of
you
to
think
of
it
in
the
first
place
and
we
keep
the
little
coral
pendant
for
both
of
us
if
you
like
but
the
bracelet
is
something
that
may
mean
a
great
deal
to
you
yet
and
you
ought
to
have
it
do
you
agree
with
me
janet
i
certainly
do
added
janet
heartily
and
what
more
i
thought
of
something
else
when
captain
brett
comes
home
next
time
he
be
able
to
tell
us
something
more
about
the
other
bracelet
when
do
you
expect
him
marcia
not
for
two
or
three
months
replied
marcia
ruefully
i
give
anything
if
it
could
only
be
sooner
it
seems
as
if
we
could
wait
that
long
well
let
not
think
of
it
just
now
comforted
janet
i
suppose
we
can
find
out
anything
till
he
come
so
there
no
use
fretting
how
would
you
like
to
hear
some
music
cecily
brought
her
violin
how
good
of
you
cried
cecily
an
almost
pathetic
eagerness
in
her
voice
it
will
be
wonderful
to
hear
it
near
by
so
marcia
opened
the
case
and
took
out
the
instrument
tuned
it
tucked
it
lovingly
under
her
chin
and
slipped
into
a
rollicking
hungarian
dance
by
brahms
while
her
little
audience
listened
spellbound
oh
something
else
please
sighed
cecily
blissfully
when
it
was
ended
and
marcia
changing
the
theme
gave
them
the
lullaby
from
jocelyn
and
after
that
beethoven
minuet
in
just
more
begged
cecily
that
is
if
you
not
too
tired
the
one
i
i
like
so
much
i
know
the
nodded
marcia
and
once
more
laid
her
bow
across
the
strings
when
the
last
note
had
died
away
they
were
all
suddenly
startled
by
a
strange
sound
just
outside
the
door
a
sound
that
was
partly
a
sob
and
partly
a
exclamation
before
she
quite
realized
what
she
was
doing
janet
who
happened
to
be
sitting
near
the
door
sprang
up
and
threw
it
open
illustration
in
the
sudden
light
of
the
open
door
she
stood
revealed
in
the
hall
outside
stood
miss
benedict
her
hands
clasped
tensely
in
front
of
her
but
strangest
of
all
her
veil
was
thrown
back
from
her
face
and
in
the
sudden
light
of
the
open
door
she
stood
revealed
in
an
instant
they
realized
that
cecily
had
not
exaggerated
the
beauty
of
her
singularly
lovely
face
she
plainly
had
been
listening
captivated
to
the
music
within
the
room
and
something
about
it
must
have
stirred
her
strangely
all
this
they
noticed
in
the
fraction
of
a
moment
for
as
she
saw
them
she
pulled
down
her
veil
with
a
hasty
movement
murmuring
something
about
having
heard
music
and
coming
to
see
what
it
was
but
she
did
not
pull
it
down
quickly
enough
to
hide
one
fact
from
the
gaze
of
the
two
girls
that
her
beautiful
gray
eyes
were
brimming
with
tears
chapter
xii
miss
benedict
speaks
it
was
miss
minerva
who
decided
that
miss
benedict
must
be
told
about
the
coincidence
of
the
two
bracelets
certainly
she
ought
to
know
she
declared
positively
there
must
be
reason
why
that
child
has
been
sent
to
her
and
she
ought
to
be
told
all
the
facts
concerning
her
who
knows
but
what
may
have
some
explanation
of
this
bracelet
mystery
you
tell
her
the
very
next
time
you
go
in
and
do
forget
to
take
a
jar
of
that
quince
marmalade
besides
aunt
minerva
had
determined
on
keeping
cecily
well
supplied
with
toothsome
dainties
which
commodities
she
keenly
suspected
were
scarce
in
the
big
house
in
fact
the
girls
had
told
her
that
the
marketing
for
that
establishment
so
far
as
they
had
seen
seemed
to
consist
mainly
of
milk
and
eggs
rice
and
prunes
so
a
day
or
two
after
when
they
visited
cecily
again
they
planned
to
have
an
interview
with
her
guardian
marcia
was
shy
about
broaching
the
subject
so
the
task
was
left
to
janet
who
being
anxious
to
settle
the
matter
immediately
began
it
as
soon
as
the
gate
was
opened
miss
benedict
she
said
there
is
something
quite
strange
about
cecily
that
we
should
like
to
tell
you
could
you
spare
a
few
moments
to
hear
about
it
why
er
of
course
replied
the
little
lady
in
a
rather
startled
voice
will
you
er
that
is
i
will
come
to
her
room
in
a
little
while
if
you
will
kindly
close
the
shutters
first
and
she
directed
them
to
proceed
upstairs
without
this
time
accompanying
them
cecily
was
overjoyed
at
their
appearance
she
was
sitting
by
the
window
fully
dressed
the
sunshine
streaming
in
on
her
transforming
her
curls
into
a
radiant
halo
a
definite
change
had
come
over
her
during
the
last
few
days
caused
no
doubt
by
the
enjoyment
of
light
and
sunshine
and
companionship
she
was
losing
some
of
her
former
wan
wistful
frightened
aspect
and
assuming
more
of
the
confiding
sunny
characteristics
that
were
natural
to
her
at
the
moment
the
girls
entered
she
was
reading
a
magazine
brought
by
them
on
their
previous
visit
after
the
first
greetings
and
chat
they
reported
their
conversation
with
miss
benedict
she
coming
up
soon
ended
marcia
and
we
must
get
the
shutters
closed
but
what
on
earth
why
she
be
like
ordinary
people
and
enjoy
the
air
and
sunshine
like
the
rest
of
us
do
know
cecily
no
i
ca
imagine
it
has
all
seemed
very
strange
to
me
ever
since
i
came
but
you
know
how
odd
miss
benedict
is
i
ca
abide
asking
her
any
questions
and
she
never
explains
anything
the
whole
house
is
darkened
like
this
all
the
time
and
since
she
let
me
open
my
shutters
she
never
once
been
in
this
room
in
the
daytime
she
never
goes
out
without
that
heavy
veil
not
even
into
the
garden
i
do
understand
it
do
you
know
suggested
marcia
half
under
her
breath
one
would
almost
think
she
had
done
something
wrong
and
was
ashamed
of
showing
her
face
in
the
daylight
i
heard
of
such
things
and
that
would
explain
some
other
queer
things
about
this
place
too
like
hush
warned
janet
i
hear
her
coming
in
another
moment
miss
benedict
had
opened
the
door
and
in
the
very
dim
light
marcia
had
been
closing
the
shutters
as
they
talked
they
saw
an
unusual
sight
miss
benedict
had
come
to
them
without
her
bonnet
and
veil
the
change
in
her
appearance
was
surprising
her
wonderful
white
hair
was
piled
on
top
of
her
head
in
a
heavy
coronet
braid
her
complexion
was
singularly
soft
and
youthful
and
her
lovely
gray
eyes
even
in
the
dim
light
easily
seemed
her
most
attractive
feature
it
was
a
curious
contrast
made
by
the
removal
of
the
ugly
bonnet
and
veil
in
them
she
appeared
a
little
insignificant
unattractive
personality
without
them
though
short
and
slight
of
figure
she
possessed
a
look
and
manner
almost
regal
she
did
not
refer
to
the
omission
of
her
usual
headgear
but
took
a
seat
and
quietly
asked
them
what
they
had
to
tell
her
janet
undertook
to
explain
and
began
by
telling
how
cecily
had
sent
the
little
gift
to
them
via
the
string
and
ended
by
explaining
about
aunt
minerva
duplicate
miss
benedict
listened
to
it
all
without
comment
when
janet
had
finished
and
held
out
the
two
bracelets
for
her
to
examine
she
merely
took
them
and
laid
them
in
her
lap
scarcely
glancing
at
them
they
waited
breathless
for
her
response
no
she
said
i
know
nothing
about
these
bracelets
it
is
of
course
very
singular
a
surprising
coincidence
that
your
aunt
should
have
one
of
them
but
i
know
nothing
about
them
any
more
than
i
know
about
cecily
herself
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
ever
referred
to
the
matter
before
cecily
and
it
was
evident
that
it
was
not
easy
for
her
to
do
so
i
might
as
well
speak
plainly
to
you
all
about
this
since
the
matter
has
come
up
i
did
not
know
little
cecily
i
had
never
heard
of
her
nor
anything
about
her
before
she
came
here
i
can
not
imagine
why
she
was
sent
i
have
no
relatives
whose
child
she
could
have
been
nor
any
friend
who
could
have
given
her
into
my
care
then
why
interrupted
janet
if
you
will
pardon
me
for
asking
miss
benedict
why
did
you
take
her
in
the
day
she
came
miss
benedict
manner
instantly
became
a
trifle
confused
and
embarrassed
it
is
er
a
little
difficult
to
explain
i
confess
she
stammered
the
truth
is
i
er
it
is
commonly
reported
that
we
that
is
i
have
some
means
i
have
frequently
in
the
past
years
received
very
strange
letters
from
people
utterly
unknown
to
me
begging
letters
letters
proposing
to
invest
my
money
for
me
oh
i
can
not
begin
to
tell
you
all
the
strange
things
these
letters
propose
i
understand
it
is
a
not
unusual
experience
with
people
i
have
even
received
letters
proposing
that
i
adopt
the
writer
children
and
eventually
settle
my
money
on
them
here
janet
and
marcia
could
not
repress
a
giggle
and
miss
benedict
smiled
slightly
in
sympathy
it
sound
absurd
she
admitted
but
it
is
quite
true
and
has
often
been
most
annoying
so
when
the
letter
arrived
announcing
cecily
coming
for
which
there
was
given
no
particular
explanation
i
thought
it
simply
another
case
of
a
similar
kind
and
i
resolved
to
dismiss
both
the
child
and
her
attendant
as
soon
as
they
appeared
but
when
the
day
came
strangely
enough
i
changed
my
mind
it
was
cecily
herself
led
me
to
do
so
i
felt
as
soon
as
i
looked
at
her
that
whoever
had
sent
her
here
and
for
whatever
purpose
the
child
herself
was
innocent
of
any
fraud
or
imposture
she
believed
that
i
would
receive
her
that
i
it
was
all
right
there
was
something
about
her
eyes
her
look
her
whole
manner
i
can
not
explain
it
and
that
was
not
all
there
was
another
reason
i
suddenly
realized
how
very
lonely
i
was
how
desirable
it
would
be
to
have
with
me
a
young
companion
like
cecily
i
know
that
the
life
i
lead
is
is
different
and
peculiar
it
is
owing
to
unusual
circumstances
that
i
can
not
explain
to
you
but
i
have
become
so
accustomed
to
this
life
that
of
late
years
i
scarcely
realized
it
so
different
but
when
i
saw
cecily
i
felt
suddenly
its
loneliness
with
the
laying
aside
of
her
veil
miss
benedict
seemed
also
to
have
laid
aside
some
of
the
reticence
in
which
she
had
shrouded
herself
and
her
three
hearers
listening
spellbound
realized
how
utterly
charming
she
could
be
if
she
herself
to
be
so
a
great
desire
seized
me
she
went
on
to
take
her
in
and
keep
her
with
me
a
while
if
later
some
one
came
to
claim
her
well
and
good
i
would
let
her
go
or
if
no
one
came
and
i
found
i
had
been
mistaken
that
she
was
not
companionable
i
could
make
some
other
provision
for
her
meantime
i
would
yield
to
this
new
desire
and
enjoy
her
presence
here
in
addition
to
that
the
lady
in
whose
company
she
had
traveled
was
not
in
position
to
keep
cecily
longer
with
her
and
the
child
would
be
left
without
protection
so
i
took
her
in
and
so
i
have
kept
her
ever
since
because
i
am
daily
becoming
more
attached
to
her
it
was
a
great
admission
for
this
reticent
little
lady
and
they
all
realized
it
so
deeply
were
they
impressed
that
none
of
them
could
make
any
response
presently
miss
benedict
continued
after
cecily
had
told
me
her
story
i
determined
to
write
to
the
village
of
cranby
england
and
find
out
what
i
could
about
her
mother
marlowe
i
knew
no
one
to
whom
i
could
address
the
inquiries
but
sent
them
on
chance
to
the
vicar
of
the
parish
church
in
due
time
i
received
a
reply
it
stated
that
marlowe
was
not
a
native
of
that
town
but
came
there
to
live
about
twelve
years
ago
with
her
daughter
nothing
was
known
about
her
personal
affairs
except
that
her
husband
and
all
her
people
were
dead
and
that
she
had
come
there
from
a
distant
part
of
england
because
the
climate
of
her
former
home
did
not
agree
with
her
little
daughter
she
never
talked
much
about
herself
and
lived
in
a
very
retired
quiet
way
she
left
no
property
or
effects
of
any
value
why
she
should
have
sent
her
child
to
me
was
as
much
a
mystery
as
ever
about
cecily
father
the
vicar
knew
nothing
that
is
all
the
information
i
have
miss
benedict
stopped
abruptly
cecily
opened
her
lips
to
say
something
then
closed
them
again
without
having
spoken
marcia
fidgeted
uneasily
in
her
chair
miss
benedict
looked
down
at
her
lap
an
embarrassed
silence
seemed
to
have
fallen
on
them
all
only
janet
knitting
her
brows
over
the
puzzle
was
unaware
of
it
but
miss
benedict
she
began
we
all
think
that
these
bracelets
may
have
something
to
do
with
cecily
affairs
might
explain
a
good
deal
of
the
mystery
if
we
could
only
puzzle
them
out
have
you
noticed
what
strange
signs
there
are
on
them
we
think
they
must
be
something
in
chinese
let
me
give
you
a
little
more
light
and
then
you
can
see
them
better
and
janet
deeply
immersed
in
the
subject
and
still
unconscious
of
her
blunder
was
about
to
go
and
open
a
shutter
when
miss
benedict
quickly
raised
her
hand
please
er
do
not
she
exclaimed
hurriedly
oh
i
beg
your
pardon
i
forgot
cried
janet
in
confusion
and
the
silence
at
once
became
more
embarrassed
than
ever
so
much
so
in
fact
that
miss
benedict
evidently
felt
impelled
to
explain
her
conduct
and
she
made
the
first
revelation
concerning
her
singular
mode
of
life
i
am
er
my
eyes
are
not
able
to
stand
it
for
years
i
have
suffered
with
some
obscure
trouble
in
them
i
can
but
i
can
not
stand
any
bright
light
it
hurts
them
beyond
endurance
at
home
i
must
have
the
rooms
darkened
in
this
way
and
when
i
go
out
even
my
heavy
veil
is
not
sufficient
behind
it
i
must
also
wear
smoked
spectacles
she
said
no
more
but
she
did
not
need
to
a
little
inarticulate
murmur
of
sympathy
rose
from
her
listeners
and
in
the
twilight
of
the
room
marcia
glanced
quickly
and
guiltily
into
janet
contrite
face
chapter
xiii
via
wireless
it
was
a
week
after
the
events
of
the
last
chapter
the
girls
had
gone
regularly
every
day
to
visit
cecily
it
was
marcia
who
had
finally
mustered
up
courage
to
ask
miss
benedict
if
cecily
could
not
go
into
the
garden
and
enjoy
there
some
outdoor
air
and
sunshine
miss
benedict
had
hesitated
at
first
but
at
last
she
conceded
that
cecily
and
the
girls
might
sit
in
the
garden
if
they
would
go
out
of
the
house
by
a
small
side
door
and
remain
on
that
side
of
the
house
they
found
that
this
door
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
house
from
cecily
room
consequently
they
had
never
seen
it
and
they
soon
discovered
one
reason
at
least
why
miss
benedict
wished
them
to
remain
exclusively
on
that
side
it
was
screened
both
back
and
front
by
thick
bushes
and
trees
and
at
the
side
above
the
garden
wall
rose
the
high
blank
side
of
a
building
unrelieved
by
a
single
window
here
they
were
as
absolutely
screened
from
public
view
as
if
they
were
within
the
house
here
also
was
an
old
rustic
bench
and
table
and
they
spent
several
happy
mornings
in
the
secluded
spot
sewing
reading
and
chatting
cecily
seemed
fairly
to
open
out
before
their
eyes
like
a
expanding
in
warm
sunny
atmosphere
only
at
times
now
did
she
show
any
trace
of
the
frightened
repression
of
their
earlier
acquaintance
they
seldom
talked
abut
the
mystery
surrounding
her
because
they
had
discovered
that
any
allusion
to
it
only
made
her
uneasy
unhappy
and
rather
silent
moreover
further
discussion
of
it
was
rather
useless
as
they
seemed
to
have
reached
a
point
in
its
solution
beyond
which
progress
was
hopeless
so
they
talked
gaily
about
themselves
and
their
own
affairs
sometimes
of
their
former
home
in
northam
the
pleasant
new
england
village
occasionally
cecily
would
reciprocate
by
allowing
them
glimpses
of
her
life
in
the
obscure
little
english
town
from
which
she
had
come
only
rarely
did
she
allude
to
the
circumstances
of
her
present
home
and
though
the
girls
secretly
ached
to
know
more
about
it
they
were
too
tactful
to
ask
any
questions
one
query
whose
answer
they
could
not
guess
was
this
who
was
the
other
mysterious
old
lady
kept
so
closely
a
prisoner
in
her
room
by
miss
benedict
and
why
was
she
so
kept
marcia
and
janet
were
never
tired
of
discussing
this
question
between
themselves
that
it
was
a
relative
they
could
not
doubt
and
they
recalled
one
or
two
remarks
miss
benedict
had
dropped
particularly
when
she
had
said
we
that
is
i
have
some
means
the
we
must
certainly
have
referred
to
herself
and
the
other
one
but
could
that
other
one
be
mother
sister
aunt
or
cousin
and
why
was
there
so
much
secrecy
about
her
cecily
had
only
said
that
miss
benedict
referred
to
her
as
the
lady
in
there
who
is
not
very
well
but
why
conceal
so
carefully
just
an
ordinary
invalid
you
never
can
tell
though
remarked
janet
decisively
one
night
when
they
had
been
discussing
the
matter
with
aunt
minerva
were
you
ever
more
stunned
marcia
than
at
the
reason
she
gave
for
having
all
the
shutters
closed
i
think
it
was
the
most
pitiful
thing
i
ever
heard
i
could
just
have
sat
and
about
it
and
it
was
so
different
from
all
the
awful
things
we
imagined
perhaps
there
is
just
as
good
a
reason
for
this
other
mystery
but
what
puzzles
me
broke
in
aunt
minerva
impatiently
is
why
that
woman
if
she
so
wealthy
does
go
to
a
good
oculist
and
have
some
treatment
for
her
eyes
they
can
do
such
wonders
nowadays
why
on
earth
does
she
endure
it
i
never
heard
of
anything
so
silly
i
suppose
it
for
the
same
reason
that
she
would
have
a
doctor
when
she
hurt
her
ankle
said
marcia
she
evidently
does
want
a
stranger
in
the
house
even
for
such
important
things
as
those
one
day
cecily
asked
marcia
why
she
never
brought
in
her
violin
since
the
occasion
of
the
first
visit
and
requested
that
she
bring
it
with
her
next
day
and
give
them
a
concert
so
on
the
following
day
marcia
came
armed
with
her
violin
case
and
also
an
interesting
new
book
from
the
library
that
she
thought
cecily
would
enjoy
let
read
the
book
first
cecily
elected
so
sitting
in
the
secluded
corner
of
the
garden
the
three
spent
a
happy
morning
reading
aloud
turn
about
while
the
others
worked
at
their
embroidery
at
last
when
all
were
tired
cecily
begged
marcia
to
play
and
she
laid
her
book
aside
and
took
up
the
violin
what
shall
i
play
she
asked
something
lively
no
said
cecily
play
something
soft
and
sweet
and
dreamy
i
feel
just
in
that
mood
it
too
hot
for
lively
things
marcia
played
the
liszt
liebestraum
and
a
lovely
setting
of
the
old
scotch
song
loch
lomond
and
after
that
the
melody
in
and
then
at
cecily
entreating
glance
she
drifted
as
usual
into
the
träumerei
do
you
know
said
cecily
when
she
had
ended
i
believe
i
must
have
heard
that
thing
when
i
was
a
baby
it
the
only
reason
i
can
think
of
that
it
seems
so
so
familiar
and
yet
unless
i
heard
it
a
great
great
many
times
then
i
do
think
it
would
have
made
such
an
impression
on
me
and
where
could
i
have
heard
it
play
it
again
marcia
please
marcia
obligingly
began
but
she
had
gone
no
farther
than
the
first
few
measures
when
the
door
opened
and
miss
benedict
appeared
she
seemed
very
much
agitated
and
her
bonnet
and
veil
donned
in
an
evident
hurry
were
slightly
awry
i
beg
you
she
began
turning
to
marcia
not
to
play
any
more
i
er
it
is
is
not
because
it
is
not
beautiful
but
it
is
is
slightly
disturbing
to
some
one
inside
why
of
course
i
wo
miss
benedict
said
marcia
dropping
her
bow
i
would
have
done
such
a
thing
if
i
dreamed
it
would
disturb
any
one
it
is
it
is
that
do
love
it
stammered
miss
benedict
for
i
do
but
it
seems
to
be
very
upsetting
to
she
hesitated
just
a
fraction
of
a
moment
and
then
seemed
to
take
a
sudden
to
my
sister
she
ended
flutteringly
as
though
the
simple
admission
carried
something
damaging
with
it
it
required
strong
for
the
three
girls
not
to
exchange
glances
oh
i
hope
i
have
done
her
any
harm
cried
marcia
contritely
no
she
it
has
just
made
her
a
little
nervous
she
will
be
all
right
soon
i
trust
but
i
noticed
that
it
had
the
same
effect
before
went
on
miss
benedict
i
fear
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
not
not
to
play
again
in
her
hearing
and
i
am
very
sorry
both
for
cecily
and
myself
and
she
retreated
into
the
house
again
closing
the
door
softly
on
the
way
back
to
luncheon
that
noon
the
girls
excitedly
discussed
the
newest
turn
of
affairs
and
the
newest
revelation
made
by
their
strange
neighbor
and
so
absorbed
were
they
in
this
fresh
interest
and
so
anxious
to
impart
it
to
aunt
minerva
that
they
scarcely
noticed
she
was
laboring
under
a
suppressed
excitement
quite
as
great
as
their
own
indeed
she
paid
but
scant
attention
to
their
recital
and
when
they
had
finished
her
only
comment
was
very
odd
very
odd
indeed
but
you
never
can
guess
about
the
news
have
no
no
of
course
i
ca
guess
tell
us
quick
cried
marcia
impatiently
it
something
wonderful
i
know
miss
minerva
made
no
reply
but
suddenly
laid
a
wireless
telegram
before
them
marcia
snatched
it
up
and
read
aloud
of
will
be
home
in
two
edwin
brett
hurrah
hurrah
she
cried
father
coming
a
whole
two
months
before
we
expected
him
we
hear
something
about
the
bracelet
and
who
knows
what
will
happen
after
that
chapter
xiv
the
writing
on
the
bracelets
in
the
joy
of
seeing
her
father
after
months
of
absence
marcia
almost
forgot
the
mystery
of
benedict
folly
almost
but
not
quite
captain
brett
had
been
at
home
hours
and
had
had
time
to
give
an
account
of
all
the
intervening
weeks
before
the
subject
was
broached
then
the
next
morning
with
a
great
air
of
mystery
the
two
girls
and
aunt
minerva
made
him
sit
down
and
listen
to
the
entire
story
at
its
conclusion
they
produced
the
two
filigree
bracelets
for
his
inspection
h
he
exclaimed
and
whistling
softly
under
his
breath
examined
them
with
minute
care
and
then
being
a
man
of
few
words
he
only
remarked
so
you
think
these
were
once
a
pair
why
of
course
cried
marcia
do
you
it
looks
remarkably
like
it
he
conceded
do
tell
us
how
you
happened
to
get
yours
she
begged
there
nothing
much
to
tell
replied
captain
brett
happened
to
be
in
one
day
and
a
chinese
sailor
thrust
this
under
my
nose
and
whined
that
he
let
me
have
it
for
two
mexican
dollars
they
always
trying
to
get
rid
of
things
like
this
when
they
want
some
spare
cash
one
never
knows
where
they
pick
them
up
i
want
the
trinket
particularly
but
i
saw
that
it
was
a
unique
little
piece
and
worth
probably
much
more
so
i
bought
it
tucked
it
away
in
my
trunk
and
forgot
it
till
i
arrived
home
when
i
gave
it
to
you
minerva
that
all
i
know
about
it
how
long
ago
was
that
asked
janet
must
have
been
at
least
twelve
years
ago
i
not
sure
of
the
exact
year
but
what
do
these
things
mean
questioned
miss
minerva
pointing
to
the
strange
characters
in
the
they
chinese
characters
certainly
but
i
do
know
what
they
mean
you
see
them
on
lots
of
their
jewelry
and
gimcracks
generally
mean
luck
or
or
some
such
motto
ca
say
whether
these
mean
anything
of
that
kind
or
not
but
tell
me
father
do
you
honestly
believe
that
if
we
could
get
these
translated
find
out
what
they
mean
it
might
give
us
clue
to
the
puzzle
marcia
appealed
to
him
it
might
or
it
might
not
he
answered
skeptically
so
many
of
these
characters
might
be
meaningless
as
far
as
any
personal
application
was
concerned
well
anyway
we
get
them
translated
just
for
our
own
satisfaction
demanded
marcia
nothing
simpler
smiled
captain
brett
my
boatswain
is
a
chinese
very
learned
man
reads
his
confucius
in
off
hours
he
be
sure
to
help
you
with
it
oh
goody
and
when
can
we
have
it
done
cried
marcia
aglow
with
anticipation
well
you
all
coming
down
to
visit
the
ship
bring
the
bracelets
along
and
i
see
that
lee
ching
is
on
hand
to
give
you
his
assistance
but
i
warn
you
count
too
much
on
what
you
may
discover
from
it
i
do
want
you
to
have
a
bad
disappointment
in
spite
of
which
warning
notwithstanding
the
girls
slept
little
that
night
so
excited
were
they
over
the
prospect
and
when
they
did
sleep
dreamed
impossible
dreams
mainly
of
quite
unintelligible
translations
of
cryptic
chinese
characters
the
visit
to
captain
brett
ship
empress
of
would
have
been
an
event
apart
from
any
other
interest
involved
in
the
expedition
marcia
and
janet
had
never
in
their
lives
been
on
board
of
an
ocean
steamer
even
the
approach
to
it
was
fascinating
the
long
covered
wharves
with
their
strange
spicy
odors
the
bustle
and
activity
of
loading
and
unloading
the
narrow
gangways
the
dark
waist
of
the
vessel
and
the
immaculate
white
paint
of
the
decks
they
examined
every
inch
of
the
huge
steamer
from
the
to
the
on
the
forecastle
deck
and
spent
half
an
hour
in
the
cozy
tiny
cabin
that
was
the
captain
own
marveling
at
the
compactness
and
handiness
of
every
detail
when
they
all
went
up
to
the
for
luncheon
which
was
served
under
an
awning
marcia
and
janet
could
scarcely
eat
for
watching
the
deft
silent
sphinxlike
chinese
cook
who
waited
on
them
they
tasted
strange
dishes
that
day
some
of
which
like
curry
and
rice
were
scarcely
acceptable
to
their
unaccustomed
palates
now
said
the
captain
in
the
middle
of
the
meal
if
we
were
only
out
on
the
china
sea
or
bowling
along
over
the
pacific
this
would
be
just
right
you
have
more
of
an
appetite
in
that
salt
air
than
you
do
hemmed
in
by
these
noisy
docks
but
it
was
not
the
docks
that
had
stolen
away
the
appetites
of
marcia
and
janet
they
were
boiling
with
impatience
to
see
the
boatswain
that
student
of
confucius
who
could
perhaps
throw
some
new
light
on
their
mystery
ambrosia
and
nectar
for
luncheon
would
scarcely
have
appealed
to
them
under
the
circumstances
at
last
however
the
meal
was
ended
with
the
curious
little
chinese
nuts
whose
meat
is
almost
like
a
raisin
then
when
the
table
was
cleared
and
the
captain
had
lit
his
cigar
he
spoke
the
word
that
caused
their
hearts
to
jump
and
their
eyes
to
brighten
now
i
suppose
you
want
to
see
lee
ching
he
beckoned
to
a
sailor
and
sent
him
to
find
the
boatswain
lee
ching
arrived
with
promptitude
saluted
his
captain
and
stood
gravely
at
attention
he
was
not
a
young
man
and
he
had
a
decidedly
oriental
face
it
seemed
strange
that
he
should
be
dressed
in
the
conventional
boatswain
uniform
with
peaked
cap
and
the
whistle
of
his
office
one
could
imagine
him
better
in
some
chinese
garment
with
a
long
down
his
back
lee
ching
said
the
captain
these
young
ladies
are
very
much
interested
in
these
two
bracelets
that
have
come
into
their
possession
the
characters
on
them
you
see
are
in
your
language
we
wonder
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
translate
them
for
us
lee
ching
took
the
trinkets
and
examined
them
minutely
presently
he
asked
will
ladies
have
what
say
by
word
of
mouth
the
captain
was
about
to
answer
yes
and
then
changed
his
mind
no
it
may
be
rather
important
and
we
want
to
remember
it
accurately
we
would
be
obliged
if
you
would
write
it
out
lee
ching
nodded
gravely
will
captain
permit
i
retire
to
cabin
he
requested
and
on
being
dismissed
he
retreated
with
a
formal
bow
but
he
write
english
cried
marcia
when
he
had
disappeared
of
course
he
can
better
than
he
can
speak
it
laughed
the
captain
english
is
child
play
compared
to
that
language
of
his
i
must
say
though
that
lee
ching
is
rather
unusual
as
chinese
sailors
go
he
studied
in
the
university
of
pekin
reads
and
writes
english
well
and
never
speaks
why
he
spending
his
life
as
boatswain
of
a
i
do
know
he
fitted
for
far
different
things
but
i
have
an
idea
it
on
account
of
his
health
that
he
follows
the
sea
the
time
before
lee
ching
reappearance
seemed
to
the
girls
interminable
though
in
all
probability
it
was
not
more
than
fifteen
minutes
at
last
however
he
returned
laid
the
bracelets
and
a
slip
of
paper
in
the
captain
hand
and
was
about
to
retire
one
moment
said
captain
brett
is
the
writing
on
the
two
bracelets
the
same
illustration
words
on
two
bracelets
are
identical
replied
lee
ching
precisely
words
on
two
bracelets
are
identical
replied
lee
ching
precisely
that
is
all
then
and
thank
you
and
the
captain
dismissed
him
oh
it
cried
marcia
or
i
shall
die
of
impatience
and
she
hung
over
his
shoulder
while
he
read
aloud
lee
ching
queer
angular
handwriting
illustration
writing
from
the
maker
of
melodies
to
the
on
this
day
of
their
wedding
amoy
when
he
had
finished
a
blank
look
crept
over
the
expectant
faces
of
the
two
girls
is
all
cried
janet
and
marcia
exclaimed
why
how
disappointing
it
does
tell
us
a
single
thing
wait
a
minute
said
the
captain
tugging
thoughtfully
at
his
short
mustache
while
he
studied
the
paper
i
not
so
sure
of
that
chapter
xv
puzzling
it
out
to
begin
with
captain
brett
went
on
after
a
long
and
to
janet
and
marcia
very
trying
pause
we
something
to
hold
on
to
in
just
the
date
sept
and
amoy
what
amoy
anyway
demanded
marcia
it
a
large
seaport
in
the
province
of
china
and
stopped
there
many
a
time
myself
then
there
the
date
of
this
wedding
somebody
might
possibly
remember
it
there
just
the
faintest
chance
but
there
are
any
names
given
argued
marcia
and
besides
there
must
be
hundreds
of
chinese
weddings
going
on
all
the
time
i
believe
you
could
find
any
one
who
could
remember
just
this
particular
one
there
are
one
or
two
things
about
this
you
do
understand
marcia
first
place
i
almost
certain
this
is
any
chinese
wedding
referred
to
here
the
chinese
do
do
things
that
way
i
know
a
little
about
their
customs
it
english
or
american
you
can
bank
on
another
thing
about
the
names
i
pretty
sure
that
this
contains
both
names
at
least
the
ones
the
parties
went
by
in
china
you
see
the
chinese
have
no
equivalents
in
their
language
for
such
names
as
jones
or
robinson
or
brett
for
instance
what
they
do
is
to
take
some
characteristic
of
a
person
and
give
him
a
name
signifying
that
characteristic
i
strongly
suspect
that
whatever
words
in
chinese
stand
for
of
melodies
and
are
the
names
the
man
and
woman
were
known
by
there
then
interrupted
janet
who
had
been
doing
some
rapid
thinking
the
man
must
have
been
some
kind
of
a
musician
and
the
woman
may
have
loved
flowers
or
looked
like
a
flower
or
something
of
that
sort
i
think
it
extremely
likely
agreed
the
captain
of
melodies
musician
cried
marcia
suddenly
hopping
up
from
her
in
excitement
does
that
make
you
think
of
anything
the
captain
and
janet
both
looked
rather
mystified
and
shook
their
heads
why
of
course
exclaimed
marcia
do
you
remember
how
she
adores
music
and
always
seems
to
be
remembering
something
about
that
i
warrant
just
anything
that
these
people
who
got
married
were
some
relation
to
her
and
besides
did
she
have
one
of
the
bracelets
it
looks
as
if
you
run
down
a
clue
admitted
captain
brett
but
i
sorry
to
say
it
does
help
us
much
in
discovering
who
these
contracting
parties
were
one
point
however
i
think
it
seems
to
settle
the
question
whether
the
bracelet
came
into
the
possession
of
your
little
friend
in
some
such
manner
as
i
got
the
other
or
whether
it
was
hers
by
right
as
a
family
trinket
i
believe
the
latter
almost
beyond
question
but
now
comes
the
difficulty
how
are
we
going
to
unearth
anybody
who
has
any
remembrance
of
marcia
suddenly
inspired
with
an
idea
interrupted
why
not
ask
lee
ching
he
chinese
who
knows
but
what
he
came
from
just
that
region
nothing
like
trying
said
the
captain
i
do
know
what
province
he
hails
from
but
it
wo
hurt
to
ask
and
he
sent
a
sailor
to
summon
lee
ching
once
more
when
he
appeared
the
captain
put
his
first
question
lee
ching
what
province
did
you
come
from
came
the
answer
promptly
and
the
girls
hopes
were
raised
did
you
ever
live
in
amoy
no
never
lived
there
always
in
hills
back
beyond
well
do
you
by
any
chance
happen
to
know
anything
about
the
parties
spoken
of
in
that
bracelet
translation
no
was
at
sea
at
date
mentioned
young
man
then
not
very
well
on
dry
land
must
live
on
ship
always
or
not
live
never
was
acquainted
with
parties
mentioned
thank
you
that
is
all
lee
ching
the
bright
hopes
of
the
girls
were
considerably
dampened
but
marcia
was
not
to
be
downed
anyway
she
argued
you
other
chinese
sailors
on
board
why
could
we
question
them
all
we
might
find
one
who
knows
the
captain
was
rather
dubious
about
it
yes
the
cook
and
four
sailors
are
chinese
you
can
question
them
if
you
like
but
i
afraid
it
be
much
satisfaction
they
an
appallingly
ignorant
lot
but
i
have
them
summoned
in
a
few
moments
the
five
were
lined
up
and
true
to
the
estimate
a
lot
they
were
after
much
confused
questioning
in
it
developed
that
the
cook
and
two
sailors
were
from
the
province
of
shansi
a
third
from
and
the
two
others
from
nowhere
in
particular
that
they
could
seem
to
remember
none
of
them
knew
anything
about
amoy
beyond
the
squalid
shops
about
the
wharves
the
captain
dismissed
them
all
with
a
disgusted
wave
of
his
hand
and
turned
to
the
girls
you
see
how
worse
than
useless
it
is
to
try
and
find
out
anything
from
such
sources
i
knew
it
would
be
so
but
i
did
want
to
discourage
you
now
you
just
leave
me
to
myself
for
half
an
hour
to
smoke
in
peace
and
do
a
little
thinking
go
and
look
at
them
unloading
or
roam
around
and
amuse
yourselves
in
any
way
you
like
perhaps
if
i
rack
my
brains
hard
something
will
occur
to
me
they
left
him
pacing
up
and
down
on
the
deck
puffing
at
his
cigar
while
they
went
to
explore
the
great
ship
all
over
again
but
the
occupation
though
fascinating
failed
to
keep
their
thoughts
from
the
latest
phase
of
the
queer
mystery
that
surrounded
cecily
marlowe
do
you
know
said
marcia
as
they
stood
looking
down
into
the
well
of
the
vast
it
seems
simply
impossible
to
me
to
connect
lovely
dainty
english
cecily
with
anything
so
oriental
as
china
i
ca
understand
it
i
ca
imagine
any
connection
can
you
no
i
ca
admitted
janet
and
more
than
that
where
does
miss
benedict
come
in
on
this
chinese
proposition
nothing
could
be
less
connected
with
it
than
she
i
believe
she
have
a
fit
if
she
ever
saw
that
crowd
of
chinese
sailors
your
father
had
there
a
while
ago
did
you
ever
see
such
a
rascally
looking
lot
and
poor
little
cecily
would
be
horrified
i
liked
lee
ching
though
he
so
grave
and
serious
and
dignified
and
is
his
english
fascinating
i
just
love
to
hear
him
talk
but
oh
i
wish
father
had
sent
us
away
for
half
an
hour
i
can
hardly
wait
for
the
time
to
pass
let
go
and
look
at
those
men
on
the
dock
unloading
why
do
they
make
such
a
racket
you
think
there
was
a
fire
or
something
so
they
whiled
away
the
time
and
at
last
promptly
on
the
minute
raced
back
to
captain
brett
well
demanded
marcia
breathless
what
now
just
had
a
happy
thought
the
captain
threw
the
stump
of
his
finished
cigar
over
the
rail
i
been
trying
to
think
whom
i
could
remember
meeting
in
china
during
the
past
years
some
responsible
person
who
might
know
these
people
or
be
able
to
track
them
down
suddenly
recalled
old
major
goodrich
he
was
an
english
military
attaché
stationed
at
for
a
while
and
i
got
to
know
him
rather
well
he
was
retired
some
years
ago
and
the
last
i
heard
of
him
he
was
living
in
this
country
somewhere
in
pennsylvania
with
his
only
daughter
who
happened
to
have
married
an
american
if
anybody
were
likely
to
know
anything
about
this
business
it
would
be
he
for
he
knew
everybody
and
everything
worth
knowing
about
in
amoy
at
the
time
i
look
up
his
address
and
write
to
him
now
i
hope
that
satisfies
you
both
father
you
a
trump
cried
marcia
blissfully
i
you
get
right
to
the
bottom
of
this
mystery
at
once
hold
on
do
count
your
chickens
before
they
hatched
warned
the
captain
this
is
only
a
possibility
not
a
the
major
may
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
but
look
here
it
high
time
we
were
heading
for
home
we
do
want
to
be
late
to
dinner
they
reached
the
apartment
bursting
with
news
to
tell
aunt
minerva
but
were
met
at
the
door
by
that
lady
flushed
flustered
and
very
much
excited
such
a
state
of
affairs
she
cried
an
hour
ago
i
received
a
telegram
from
cousin
drusilla
in
northam
saying
she
was
very
ill
indeed
and
would
i
come
up
at
once
as
she
was
virtually
all
alone
of
course
i
got
to
go
i
ca
leave
her
there
sick
without
a
soul
to
look
after
her
but
what
on
earth
are
you
all
going
to
do
oh
go
right
along
minerva
the
girls
and
i
will
get
on
famously
they
can
try
their
hand
at
housekeeping
and
you
a
good
maid
in
the
kitchen
to
help
do
you
worry
a
minute
yes
but
began
aunt
minerva
you
got
just
fifteen
minutes
to
catch
the
boston
express
said
the
captain
decisively
looking
at
his
watch
give
me
that
suitcase
and
come
right
along
aunt
minerva
who
had
really
been
all
packed
and
ready
for
the
past
minutes
meekly
obeyed
i
wo
be
gone
more
than
a
few
days
she
remarked
as
she
kissed
the
girls
i
get
some
one
to
take
my
place
with
drusilla
just
as
soon
as
i
can
do
let
eliza
boil
the
corn
too
long
and
tell
her
the
sentence
was
never
finished
for
the
captain
at
that
point
gently
but
firmly
led
her
into
the
hall
and
closed
the
door
and
though
the
girls
suspected
it
not
this
sudden
departure
of
aunt
minerva
had
more
bearing
on
the
mystery
they
were
trying
to
solve
than
any
of
them
dreamed
chapter
xvi
one
mystery
explained
meantime
cecily
marlowe
immured
in
the
lonely
house
had
been
having
an
experience
all
her
own
and
when
the
girls
came
to
see
her
the
day
after
the
visit
to
the
ship
she
too
was
bursting
with
news
but
she
quietly
waited
till
they
had
told
their
own
tale
and
was
as
puzzled
as
they
about
the
strange
translation
of
the
characters
on
the
bracelet
of
anything
pertaining
to
china
or
the
chinese
she
had
not
the
remotest
notion
and
could
not
understand
how
it
could
have
any
connection
with
her
affairs
now
you
must
hear
story
she
began
when
they
had
discussed
the
newest
development
till
there
was
nothing
left
to
discuss
it
about
miss
benedict
she
has
but
just
wait
and
i
begin
at
the
beginning
it
was
two
nights
ago
and
she
had
one
of
those
headaches
she
has
such
very
bad
ones
you
know
she
says
they
are
from
her
poor
and
she
suffers
terribly
well
she
had
a
worse
one
than
usual
and
so
she
was
obliged
to
call
me
into
her
room
and
ask
me
to
fetch
things
for
her
i
sat
by
her
and
bathed
her
head
and
fanned
her
and
at
last
she
fell
asleep
even
then
i
did
go
away
but
sat
there
fanning
and
fanning
her
for
a
long
time
till
finally
after
a
couple
of
hours
she
woke
up
she
was
very
much
better
then
and
presently
she
began
to
talk
to
me
quite
differently
from
what
she
ever
had
before
first
she
asked
me
if
i
were
contented
and
happy
here
i
said
i
tried
to
be
but
i
was
very
lonely
sometimes
she
did
say
much
to
that
but
suddenly
she
spoke
again
illustration
child
i
suppose
you
wonder
very
much
at
this
queer
life
i
lead
i
suppose
you
wonder
very
much
at
this
queer
life
i
lead
you
i
said
yes
i
could
help
wondering
about
it
then
she
turned
away
her
head
and
whispered
if
you
only
you
would
not
wonder
i
have
been
very
unhappy
my
life
has
been
very
unhappy
all
i
could
think
of
to
answer
her
was
that
i
was
so
sorry
and
she
need
not
tell
me
anything
she
did
wish
to
i
would
never
ask
about
it
and
she
raised
herself
up
in
bed
and
said
just
it
dear
child
i
have
always
supposed
that
young
folks
were
one
and
all
curious
inquisitive
and
thoughtless
that
is
one
reason
i
was
so
so
strict
with
you
in
the
beginning
but
you
and
those
two
nice
girls
next
door
have
been
a
revelation
to
me
was
that
lovely
of
her
exclaimed
cecily
interrupting
herself
just
darling
cried
marcia
but
do
go
on
cecily
we
crazy
to
hear
what
came
next
well
next
she
said
think
i
live
a
very
singular
life
i
know
they
think
i
eccentric
queer
crazy
even
oh
know
it
but
there
are
few
alive
and
none
in
this
neighborhood
who
even
guess
at
the
real
reason
who
remember
and
then
she
put
her
hand
to
her
head
as
if
it
was
aching
badly
and
dropped
back
on
the
pillow
she
was
very
quiet
for
a
while
but
at
last
she
looked
up
again
and
said
cecily
would
you
care
to
have
a
home
with
me
always
would
you
be
willing
to
put
up
with
my
queerness
and
peculiarities
and
some
of
the
strange
conditions
here
and
i
answered
indeed
yes
if
i
could
go
out
once
in
a
while
and
visit
you
girls
occasionally
i
should
very
much
like
to
stay
and
she
said
course
you
shall
dear
you
have
been
dreadfully
shut
in
here
but
that
was
before
i
knew
you
so
well
i
was
not
sure
i
to
keep
you
before
but
now
i
know
that
i
do
i
only
ask
you
to
be
as
considerate
of
me
as
you
can
some
day
i
feel
certain
i
shall
lose
my
sight
i
know
that
it
is
coming
when
it
does
come
i
shall
have
to
depend
very
very
much
on
you
i
and
one
other
you
will
not
fail
me
then
will
you
cecily
girls
i
could
have
cried
then
and
there
i
felt
so
for
her
and
i
told
her
she
could
depend
on
me
no
matter
what
happened
i
had
no
other
home
and
no
one
else
to
care
for
me
except
you
girls
and
after
that
she
told
me
the
story
about
herself
at
least
some
of
it
i
ca
tell
it
in
her
words
so
i
use
my
own
but
this
is
it
a
great
many
years
ago
when
this
house
was
new
she
lived
here
with
her
father
and
an
older
sister
and
a
younger
brother
they
were
all
very
happy
together
and
the
brother
was
the
pride
and
joy
and
hope
of
the
whole
family
but
one
time
he
had
a
violent
disagreement
with
his
father
she
did
tell
me
what
it
was
about
and
she
and
her
sister
took
sides
with
her
father
against
the
brother
after
that
they
had
the
same
disagreement
a
great
many
times
and
at
last
one
so
bad
that
the
young
man
declared
he
would
endure
it
any
longer
and
threatened
to
leave
home
they
did
believe
he
was
really
serious
about
it
but
the
next
morning
his
room
was
vacant
and
a
note
pinned
to
his
pillow
said
he
had
gone
away
never
to
return
they
felt
awfully
about
it
of
course
but
that
was
the
worst
about
two
weeks
later
they
received
word
that
he
had
taken
passage
on
a
steamer
for
europe
and
after
only
a
day
or
so
out
he
was
discovered
to
be
missing
so
he
must
have
fallen
overboard
or
been
washed
over
and
drowned
was
that
frightful
janet
and
marcia
looked
horrified
what
did
she
do
then
they
whispered
that
the
most
dreadful
part
went
on
cecily
the
shock
was
so
great
that
the
father
died
a
week
afterward
the
doctors
said
virtually
of
a
broken
heart
so
there
were
two
gone
and
within
a
month
the
two
that
were
left
miss
benedict
and
her
sister
shut
themselves
up
and
went
into
mourning
and
saw
almost
no
one
for
a
while
they
were
paralyzed
with
grief
and
then
little
by
little
very
gradually
they
began
to
realize
that
people
were
talking
about
them
saying
dreadful
things
one
of
the
few
friends
they
see
let
drop
little
hints
of
the
gossip
that
was
going
on
outside
people
were
saying
that
they
were
to
blame
for
it
all
and
that
they
probably
were
so
sorry
as
they
pretended
to
be
for
now
they
could
enjoy
all
the
money
themselves
can
you
imagine
anything
so
horrid
oh
but
that
nonsense
interrupted
janet
impatiently
how
could
any
one
say
it
was
their
fault
well
you
know
how
people
talk
replied
cecily
they
meant
that
by
nagging
and
quarreling
they
had
driven
the
brother
away
on
purpose
and
then
made
it
so
unpleasant
for
the
father
that
he
could
stand
it
any
longer
either
it
was
said
in
so
many
words
but
just
little
hints
and
allusions
and
shrugging
shoulders
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
but
the
meaning
was
there
underneath
it
all
as
plain
as
anything
their
grief
and
the
horrid
talk
about
them
made
them
feel
so
very
badly
that
they
determined
to
live
in
such
a
way
that
no
one
could
accuse
them
of
enjoying
an
fortune
so
they
shut
up
the
house
at
least
a
large
part
of
it
and
dismissed
all
their
servants
and
did
most
of
the
work
themselves
after
a
while
the
few
friends
they
had
began
to
drop
away
one
by
one
till
no
one
came
to
see
them
any
more
and
then
one
day
two
or
three
years
later
the
older
sister
had
a
paralytic
stroke
and
lost
her
memory
she
been
shut
up
in
that
room
ever
since
and
miss
benedict
takes
care
of
her
she
can
sit
up
in
a
chair
and
knit
and
she
likes
to
have
a
on
her
lap
and
move
the
pieces
around
because
she
once
loved
to
play
the
game
with
her
younger
brother
but
she
ca
remember
anything
not
even
who
she
is
herself
and
nothing
about
what
has
happened
miss
benedict
feels
terribly
about
her
especially
about
her
not
remembering
anything
and
she
says
that
is
why
she
did
tell
me
about
her
at
first
it
seemed
so
terrible
she
says
all
the
friends
and
relatives
they
had
are
dead
and
gone
now
so
no
one
knows
the
real
reason
for
their
queer
life
and
as
the
years
have
passed
she
has
grown
more
and
more
into
the
habit
of
living
this
way
till
it
seemed
quite
natural
to
her
at
least
it
did
till
i
came
and
now
she
is
beginning
to
realize
again
that
it
queer
and
she
was
so
afraid
of
gossip
and
talk
that
when
you
first
wanted
to
be
friends
with
me
she
would
not
allow
it
for
fear
of
starting
more
unpleasant
inquiries
into
her
life
but
what
about
her
poor
eyes
asked
janet
oh
yes
about
ten
years
ago
she
began
to
have
those
terrible
pains
in
her
eyes
and
then
she
had
to
darken
all
the
house
and
wear
the
veil
and
dark
glasses
outdoors
she
went
to
a
doctor
about
them
but
was
told
that
the
case
was
hopeless
unless
she
had
some
complicated
operation
and
spent
months
in
a
dark
room
this
she
felt
she
could
do
on
account
of
her
sister
whom
she
not
leave
to
a
stranger
care
so
she
has
just
suffered
ever
since
that
all
girls
except
that
she
told
me
her
sister
name
is
cornelia
and
that
hers
is
alixe
i
to
call
her
miss
alixe
after
this
it
makes
me
seem
a
little
nearer
to
her
what
a
pretty
name
alixe
commented
marcia
it
just
seems
to
suit
her
somehow
but
is
that
the
saddest
story
it
just
goes
to
show
how
unhappy
we
can
make
people
by
talking
about
them
and
their
affairs
and
oh
there
one
thing
more
miss
benedict
i
mean
miss
alixe
gave
me
permission
to
tell
you
all
this
but
she
only
asks
that
you
will
not
repeat
it
except
to
your
father
and
aunt
she
says
she
knows
you
can
be
depended
on
to
do
this
that
day
before
janet
and
marcia
left
they
encountered
miss
benedict
in
the
hall
and
by
the
way
she
pressed
their
hands
in
saying
they
felt
that
she
knew
cecily
had
told
them
her
story
though
she
made
no
reference
to
it
cecily
may
run
in
and
visit
you
a
while
i
think
the
change
will
do
her
good
she
remarked
at
parting
and
that
was
the
only
hint
she
gave
of
a
change
in
the
affairs
of
benedict
folly
when
janet
and
marcia
were
at
last
outside
the
gate
they
gazed
up
at
the
forbidding
brick
wall
and
drew
a
long
breath
of
wonder
so
is
the
story
breathed
marcia
what
an
awful
thing
that
two
people
lives
should
be
spoiled
just
by
unkind
gossip
but
janet
was
thinking
of
something
else
i
wonder
why
miss
benedict
did
tell
what
the
family
had
the
disagreement
about
she
queried
chapter
xvii
major
goodrich
assists
during
the
week
following
aunt
minerva
departure
the
two
girls
had
a
busy
life
taking
charge
of
the
unaccustomed
tasks
of
housekeeping
but
with
all
their
absorbing
occupations
the
three
were
waiting
on
tiptoe
of
expectation
for
a
reply
from
major
goodrich
and
even
captain
brett
could
scarcely
conceal
his
impatience
as
the
days
went
by
and
no
answer
came
at
last
one
morning
the
contained
a
letter
postmarked
from
pennsylvania
and
marcia
carried
it
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
it
was
from
the
major
he
wrote
is
there
any
way
you
can
think
of
to
furnish
me
with
an
idea
of
what
the
chinese
for
that
expression
maker
of
melodies
like
the
only
way
that
occurs
to
me
is
to
see
whether
by
any
faint
chance
lee
ching
could
write
it
in
that
romanized
colloquial
used
by
the
missionaries
that
might
give
me
an
idea
it
a
hundred
chances
to
one
he
does
know
it
if
so
just
spell
it
out
for
me
yourself
in
english
the
nearest
you
can
get
to
it
the
reason
i
want
to
know
it
is
this
there
was
a
young
fellow
in
at
the
british
military
station
a
military
aide
of
promise
who
had
a
magnificent
singing
voice
every
one
went
wild
over
him
there
he
was
the
life
of
the
garrison
and
in
social
circles
as
well
many
an
evening
we
spent
listening
to
one
of
his
impromptu
recitals
but
what
makes
me
suspect
that
he
may
be
the
one
we
after
is
that
he
foolishly
went
and
married
the
daughter
of
a
chinese
mandarin
from
one
of
the
yamêns
he
had
been
the
means
of
rendering
the
father
some
very
important
service
and
met
the
daughter
quite
by
accident
the
whole
affair
was
a
rather
remarkable
story
but
i
have
time
to
detail
it
all
to
you
now
i
saw
the
girl
just
once
afterward
she
was
a
fascinating
little
creature
with
the
golden
butterfly
pins
in
her
black
hair
and
her
rich
silk
robe
hung
with
jewels
and
her
tiny
bound
feet
but
the
young
fellow
family
back
in
england
was
furious
about
it
eventually
he
cut
loose
from
them
entirely
then
he
and
his
wife
drifted
away
from
the
region
up
to
amoy
and
finally
dropped
out
of
sight
i
imagine
he
adopted
the
chinese
customs
and
habits
and
got
to
live
at
last
very
much
like
a
native
i
never
heard
of
him
since
but
i
a
notion
he
could
be
hunted
up
if
he
still
alive
his
name
was
carringford
jack
carringford
we
used
to
call
him
the
point
however
is
that
the
chinese
called
him
by
a
name
of
their
own
signifying
eminent
singer
or
something
of
that
sort
very
much
the
same
kind
of
expression
as
that
used
on
the
bracelet
and
after
a
while
we
all
got
to
calling
him
by
it
or
some
abbreviation
of
it
pretty
regularly
i
ca
recall
just
what
it
was
now
for
i
have
thought
of
it
in
years
but
i
believe
i
recognize
it
if
i
saw
it
written
out
in
colloquial
or
any
other
english
version
get
me
that
and
i
soon
put
you
on
the
right
track
might
the
little
girl
possibly
be
the
daughter
of
carringford
no
she
interrupted
marcia
indignantly
at
this
point
does
cecily
marlowe
look
like
a
chinese
mandarin
daughter
and
certainly
with
her
golden
curls
and
big
blue
eyes
and
the
english
roses
in
her
cheeks
they
had
to
admit
that
she
did
not
and
besides
that
added
janet
her
name
is
that
does
always
signify
remarked
the
captain
it
looks
to
me
like
a
rather
clear
case
if
we
find
that
the
chinese
name
agrees
with
the
major
recollection
of
it
i
go
down
to
the
ship
but
lee
ching
is
on
shore
leave
and
wo
be
back
till
i
see
him
then
and
find
out
whether
he
knows
anything
about
this
romanized
colloquial
i
rather
doubt
it
myself
it
not
much
used
outside
of
the
missions
i
understand
what
colloquial
anyway
demanded
marcia
it
sounds
very
mysterious
no
it
is
a
bit
mysterious
answered
captain
brett
in
order
to
understand
about
it
however
you
must
know
this
fact
about
the
chinese
language
the
character
is
the
same
the
same
all
over
the
kingdom
but
it
is
the
same
in
any
of
the
different
provinces
in
fact
the
spoken
dialects
are
like
entirely
different
languages
it
seems
that
the
dialect
of
the
province
has
been
reduced
to
a
written
form
by
the
missionaries
and
called
romanized
colloquial
it
has
been
in
use
for
a
good
many
years
but
it
is
especially
recognized
by
official
or
diplomatic
circles
but
a
good
many
of
the
chinese
boys
who
attend
the
learn
it
there
it
just
possible
that
lee
ching
may
have
done
so
as
he
came
from
that
region
we
can
only
wait
and
see
if
he
does
know
it
he
be
able
to
write
out
the
chinese
equivalent
in
some
form
of
english
script
the
next
day
the
captain
went
down
to
the
of
and
returned
with
a
beaming
face
and
a
sheet
of
paper
written
on
by
lee
ching
he
knew
it
all
right
he
announced
learned
it
as
a
boy
in
the
at
here
what
he
wrote
and
he
held
the
sheet
of
paper
for
the
girls
to
see
he
put
the
chinese
characters
at
one
side
they
have
to
be
read
from
top
to
bottom
you
know
next
to
them
is
the
romanized
colloquial
and
alongside
of
that
the
english
translation
quite
a
pretty
piece
of
work
that
illustration
gracious
cried
marcia
frowning
over
the
queer
jargon
i
ca
make
a
thing
out
of
it
or
at
least
i
could
if
he
had
put
the
english
right
alongside
of
the
others
oh
this
must
be
the
name
ê
of
melodies
did
you
hear
of
such
heathenish
sounds
well
now
we
see
what
major
goodrich
has
to
say
to
that
father
will
you
send
it
right
off
to
him
at
once
announced
the
captain
i
just
about
as
anxious
as
you
folks
now
to
get
this
mystery
explained
but
the
singular
thing
was
that
somehow
the
girls
could
not
bring
themselves
to
tell
cecily
much
about
these
latest
developments
they
thought
it
would
make
her
feel
strange
and
anxious
to
realize
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
her
being
in
any
way
related
to
a
chinese
mandarin
daughter
and
besides
remarked
janet
suddenly
when
they
were
discussing
it
that
perfectly
impossible
anyway
because
her
mother
was
english
and
cecily
has
lived
with
her
all
these
years
so
this
talk
about
mandarin
daughters
and
things
is
perfectly
ridiculous
that
so
echoed
marcia
in
relief
i
did
think
of
it
at
first
but
anyway
let
not
tell
cecily
about
it
till
we
know
more
i
do
wish
aunt
minerva
were
here
i
have
written
her
about
all
this
because
there
so
much
to
explain
i
rather
wait
and
tell
her
when
she
gets
back
she
said
she
was
only
going
to
be
gone
a
little
while
and
here
it
nearly
two
weeks
in
three
days
an
answer
arrived
from
the
major
and
as
luck
would
have
it
cecily
herself
brought
the
letter
upstairs
with
her
as
she
came
in
the
postman
was
just
going
to
drop
it
in
your
box
she
explained
and
i
asked
him
to
let
me
take
it
to
you
and
save
you
the
trouble
of
coming
down
for
it
and
she
held
it
out
to
the
captain
aha
he
cried
as
he
caught
sight
of
the
writing
we
hear
some
news
why
what
the
matter
he
had
just
glimpsed
marcia
and
janet
frantically
signaling
to
him
behind
cecily
back
do
you
want
me
to
open
it
oh
not
now
explained
marcia
as
nonchalantly
as
she
could
i
want
cecily
to
come
out
to
the
kitchen
and
help
us
make
some
fudge
later
will
do
and
she
dragged
the
wondering
cecily
down
the
hall
while
the
captain
stared
after
them
muttering
well
of
all
the
cecily
stayed
rather
late
that
afternoon
and
for
the
first
time
in
all
their
acquaintance
the
girls
were
not
sorry
to
have
her
go
so
wild
with
anxiety
were
they
to
hear
the
major
letter
no
sooner
had
the
door
closed
upon
her
than
they
rushed
back
to
the
captain
what
does
he
say
they
clamored
chapter
xviii
the
major
has
a
further
inspiration
the
captain
who
was
puffing
at
his
pipe
appeared
serious
i
like
the
looks
of
this
thing
at
all
he
muttered
reaching
in
his
pocket
for
the
letter
but
what
did
he
say
tell
us
quick
cried
marcia
we
been
nearly
crazy
there
in
the
kitchen
waiting
to
have
cecily
go
so
we
could
hear
what
he
says
well
i
glad
she
did
go
first
acknowledged
the
captain
for
somehow
i
would
care
to
have
her
hear
just
yet
what
the
major
has
to
say
he
thinks
but
i
read
his
letter
and
you
can
understand
what
i
mean
here
it
is
about
the
chinese
name
first
the
one
you
sent
does
certainly
have
a
familiar
sound
to
me
especially
the
last
two
syllables
i
distinctly
remember
that
the
name
jack
carringford
was
called
by
ended
in
or
something
that
sounded
amazingly
like
it
i
would
bank
on
that
entirely
however
for
the
chinese
language
is
the
most
confusing
and
idiotic
jargon
ever
invented
by
the
mind
of
man
and
there
might
be
a
dozen
other
words
ending
the
same
and
meaning
something
entirely
different
here
a
fact
more
to
the
point
though
since
writing
to
you
last
i
been
busy
communicating
with
several
old
chums
of
the
china
days
what
i
been
trying
to
find
out
is
does
any
one
know
what
has
become
of
carringford
by
the
third
year
after
his
unfortunate
marriage
he
had
pretty
well
dropped
out
of
sight
still
i
thought
i
knew
of
one
or
two
who
might
have
kept
some
track
of
him
even
after
that
one
of
them
danforth
pettingill
an
old
chum
of
jack
is
now
living
in
new
york
and
i
thought
probably
know
as
much
as
any
one
so
i
wrote
him
at
the
very
start
and
yesterday
received
this
answer
it
seems
that
carringford
and
his
wife
lived
with
her
father
for
some
time
till
about
two
years
after
their
marriage
when
a
little
daughter
was
born
then
the
old
mandarin
who
was
fearfully
annoyed
because
the
baby
was
not
a
boy
girls
being
of
no
earthly
account
in
china
as
you
know
made
it
so
unpleasant
for
the
couple
that
they
finally
left
his
establishment
it
was
then
that
they
began
their
roaming
existence
terribly
hampered
by
the
baby
of
course
and
never
remaining
long
in
any
city
at
last
the
wife
contracted
the
plague
and
died
very
suddenly
and
carringford
was
left
alone
with
the
baby
on
his
hands
it
was
at
this
time
that
he
dropped
completely
out
of
sight
and
pettingill
never
heard
from
him
again
he
thinks
however
from
very
substantial
rumor
that
carringford
went
back
to
england
taking
the
child
with
him
he
did
go
to
his
own
folks
though
that
certain
for
pettingill
has
heard
from
them
occasionally
and
they
never
mention
him
there
was
another
rumor
afloat
about
him
for
a
time
that
he
had
taken
to
earning
his
living
by
singing
at
cheap
concerts
under
an
assumed
name
all
of
which
might
be
entirely
likely
but
what
became
of
the
child
pettingill
never
knew
nor
any
one
else
i
afraid
well
that
all
ascertained
up
to
date
but
i
still
on
the
track
and
if
i
hear
any
further
news
i
let
you
know
at
once
when
the
captain
stopped
reading
all
of
them
looked
very
serious
and
no
one
said
a
word
for
several
minutes
you
see
he
began
at
last
why
i
do
like
the
looks
of
the
thing
this
seems
to
cover
almost
all
the
points
we
been
in
doubt
about
though
of
course
it
leave
quite
a
little
to
conjecture
i
somehow
dislike
to
think
of
little
cecily
as
a
mixture
of
chinese
and
english
in
fact
it
almost
impossible
to
think
of
her
as
such
and
yet
it
seems
remarkably
near
the
truth
if
that
man
assumed
a
name
interrupted
marcia
i
suppose
it
might
as
easily
be
marlowe
as
anything
else
just
as
easily
admitted
captain
brett
and
he
went
back
to
england
just
where
cecily
came
here
from
added
janet
lugubriously
but
then
why
does
cecily
remember
something
about
him
cried
marcia
hopefully
he
may
have
been
dead
a
good
while
or
he
may
have
sent
her
off
somewhere
else
answered
the
captain
dashing
this
hope
he
be
likely
to
drag
a
child
about
in
any
such
life
as
he
must
have
had
to
lead
they
all
sank
into
a
depressed
silence
again
suddenly
marcia
had
another
idea
but
look
here
she
exclaimed
major
goodrich
says
that
man
was
at
hong
kong
and
the
bracelet
says
as
plain
as
plain
can
be
that
enough
proof
that
it
ca
be
the
same
one
again
the
captain
had
to
dampen
her
hopes
they
might
have
gone
to
amoy
to
be
married
he
said
it
entirely
possible
you
ca
tell
anything
about
that
and
besides
put
in
janet
you
got
the
bracelet
at
hong
kong
you
captain
brett
so
if
it
really
belonged
to
those
people
it
was
still
pretty
near
home
well
it
is
useless
to
conjecture
about
these
things
added
the
captain
what
bothers
me
most
of
all
is
the
question
of
what
earthly
connection
all
this
can
have
with
miss
benedict
there
does
seem
to
be
the
least
likelihood
that
the
carringfords
were
any
relations
of
hers
and
unless
cecily
was
simply
sent
there
on
a
chance
because
it
was
known
that
she
was
a
wealthy
woman
and
might
be
willing
to
provide
for
the
child
i
quite
at
a
loss
to
explain
it
i
wonder
if
there
is
any
way
we
could
find
out
mused
marcia
i
know
a
very
good
way
declared
janet
simply
ask
her
what
and
explain
all
this
strange
business
about
cecily
parents
right
away
demanded
marcia
oh
no
just
ask
her
if
she
ever
had
any
connections
in
england
named
carringford
she
say
either
yes
or
no
to
that
and
if
she
says
yes
why
then
we
know
we
are
on
the
right
track
and
can
think
what
to
do
next
janet
advice
is
pretty
good
asserted
captain
brett
and
if
i
were
you
i
put
the
question
to
miss
benedict
the
next
time
you
see
her
it
about
the
only
way
i
can
think
of
now
to
solve
this
riddle
and
so
it
was
decided
that
the
very
next
day
when
the
girls
expected
to
go
and
visit
cecily
they
should
ask
miss
benedict
the
dread
question
cecily
met
them
at
the
gate
the
next
afternoon
oh
i
so
glad
come
she
cried
i
really
very
lonely
miss
benedict
is
going
to
be
away
all
the
afternoon
because
she
has
some
business
to
attend
to
she
says
we
can
sit
in
the
garden
at
this
piece
of
news
the
girls
faces
fell
why
what
the
matter
questioned
cecily
do
you
care
to
i
thought
you
be
rather
pleased
indeed
it
will
be
fine
declared
marcia
striving
to
hide
her
disappointment
at
the
news
that
miss
benedict
would
not
be
visible
that
day
she
and
janet
had
counted
so
positively
on
having
one
at
least
of
their
vexed
questions
settled
immediately
that
it
was
difficult
to
feel
they
must
wait
two
or
three
days
more
for
on
the
morrow
cecily
was
to
visit
them
as
they
now
spent
alternate
days
in
each
others
houses
and
the
day
after
captain
brett
had
promised
to
take
the
three
of
them
on
a
trip
up
the
hudson
all
that
afternoon
however
marcia
and
janet
were
noticeably
inattentive
and
once
marcia
who
was
reading
aloud
to
the
others
stopped
short
in
the
middle
of
a
sentence
and
remained
for
three
whole
minutes
gazing
off
at
nothing
and
at
this
cecily
could
contain
her
wonder
no
longer
girls
are
you
by
any
chance
annoyed
at
me
she
ventured
marcia
suddenly
dragged
herself
back
to
the
affairs
of
the
moment
of
course
not
deary
how
could
you
think
such
a
thing
she
declared
heartily
then
something
else
is
the
matter
insisted
cecily
you
are
worrying
about
something
i
never
knew
you
to
act
so
strangely
now
tell
me
are
you
marcia
glanced
uneasily
at
janet
well
yes
we
are
she
admitted
reluctantly
but
please
do
ask
us
anything
about
it
just
yet
cecily
something
that
has
come
up
lately
seems
kind
of
queer
and
and
unpleasant
but
it
may
turn
out
all
right
in
the
end
so
we
do
want
to
tell
you
till
we
know
positively
cecily
looked
alarmed
is
it
is
it
anything
about
me
she
faltered
but
perhaps
i
ought
to
ask
marcia
looked
terribly
unhappy
at
this
question
and
janet
came
to
her
rescue
yes
it
is
cecily
she
declared
with
assumed
cheerfulness
captain
brett
has
stumbled
across
something
that
seems
as
if
it
might
have
some
connection
with
your
affairs
but
we
do
want
you
to
hear
about
it
till
we
are
positive
now
do
worry
about
it
because
i
perfectly
certain
everything
is
going
to
turn
out
all
right
you
wo
worry
will
you
she
put
her
arm
around
cecily
and
laid
her
cheek
against
the
golden
hair
no
i
try
not
to
cecily
assured
them
and
i
promise
not
to
ask
you
another
thing
about
it
till
you
ready
to
tell
me
yourselves
after
that
she
settled
down
quietly
but
it
was
apparent
to
the
girls
that
in
spite
of
her
assurances
she
was
worried
and
nervous
and
unhappy
presently
janet
had
an
inspiration
you
two
sit
here
i
going
out
for
a
few
moments
she
announced
determined
to
break
the
tension
of
unrest
and
nervousness
by
some
diversion
nor
would
she
reveal
to
them
what
her
errand
was
to
be
she
returned
in
twenty
minutes
however
with
a
box
of
delicious
french
and
some
dainty
cakes
and
for
the
next
they
had
a
gay
time
in
the
garden
serving
and
consuming
the
welcome
treat
in
the
end
they
had
temporarily
quite
forgotten
the
unhappiness
of
the
earlier
hour
and
when
they
returned
home
the
two
girls
left
cecily
laughing
and
cheerful
nor
did
she
all
through
the
ensuing
two
days
refer
in
any
way
to
their
conversation
in
the
garden
if
the
matter
worried
her
she
gave
no
sign
and
the
girls
could
not
help
admiring
her
three
days
later
marcia
and
janet
went
again
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
cecily
and
found
to
their
relief
that
miss
benedict
was
at
home
at
least
they
learned
the
fact
from
cecily
the
lady
herself
they
did
not
see
when
they
entered
and
indeed
there
was
a
chance
that
they
might
not
have
so
much
as
a
glimpse
of
her
during
their
visit
for
it
frequently
happened
that
she
was
not
visible
during
an
entire
afternoon
would
she
speak
to
them
that
day
that
was
the
question
and
what
was
even
more
important
would
they
have
a
chance
to
speak
to
her
unobserved
by
cecily
for
they
did
not
wish
the
girl
to
overhear
what
they
had
to
ask
nor
even
to
know
that
they
were
seeking
an
interview
with
her
guardian
for
the
major
part
of
the
afternoon
it
did
not
seem
as
if
their
wish
would
be
granted
miss
benedict
did
not
appear
and
so
nervous
and
anxious
were
they
that
they
could
scarcely
keep
their
thoughts
on
the
conversation
that
cecily
was
striving
to
keep
up
or
later
on
the
book
they
were
reading
cecily
had
declared
that
her
room
seemed
very
warm
so
they
were
sitting
once
more
in
the
garden
this
also
was
a
disappointment
for
it
lessened
considerably
their
chances
of
seeing
the
lady
of
their
hopes
five
came
round
and
still
they
had
not
attained
their
wish
marcia
had
just
risen
with
a
resigned
sigh
to
propose
that
they
take
their
departure
when
the
side
door
opened
and
miss
benedict
appeared
at
the
sight
of
her
the
hearts
of
marcia
and
janet
gave
a
delighted
thump
and
they
greeted
her
with
a
pleasure
the
warmth
of
which
she
could
not
entirely
understand
but
now
came
the
problem
of
getting
cecily
out
of
the
way
for
a
time
it
was
evident
that
she
had
no
intention
of
leaving
them
of
her
own
accord
and
it
was
marcia
happy
idea
that
solved
this
riddle
cecily
she
suddenly
inquired
do
you
happen
to
have
finished
that
book
i
lent
you
last
week
oh
yes
i
finished
it
last
night
i
meant
to
return
it
said
cecily
wait
a
moment
and
i
get
it
from
my
room
you
must
be
anxious
to
finish
it
yourself
i
know
and
she
hurried
indoors
unconscious
of
the
unutterable
relief
with
which
they
watched
her
go
when
she
was
out
of
sight
marcia
turned
to
miss
benedict
please
pardon
me
for
asking
a
personal
question
she
began
hurriedly
but
it
is
only
because
we
think
it
is
something
that
concerns
cecily
did
you
ever
have
in
england
or
anywhere
any
relatives
or
or
even
friends
by
the
name
of
carringford
miss
benedict
was
bonneted
and
veiled
as
usual
so
they
could
not
see
her
face
and
they
would
have
given
much
to
have
been
able
to
read
her
expression
when
she
heard
this
question
but
she
answered
very
promptly
and
positively
no
i
never
knew
of
any
one
at
all
by
that
name
why
do
you
ask
they
could
hear
cecily
footsteps
returning
down
the
stairs
only
because
we
have
discovered
something
in
connection
with
people
of
that
name
that
seems
to
concern
cecily
marcia
explained
hastily
sometime
we
will
tell
you
all
about
it
we
thought
perhaps
you
know
them
please
please
do
tell
cecily
we
spoken
about
it
just
yet
miss
benedict
had
only
time
to
signify
that
she
would
follow
their
request
when
cecily
appeared
in
the
doorway
and
the
interview
was
over
as
they
walked
home
later
they
both
admitted
to
a
feeling
of
intense
relief
that
miss
benedict
at
least
knew
nothing
about
any
carringfords
of
course
her
not
knowing
them
does
anything
declared
janet
but
one
thing
is
certain
if
she
known
them
it
would
have
been
positive
that
all
this
horrid
story
is
connected
with
cecily
but
as
she
does
it
gives
one
more
chance
that
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
her
as
they
entered
the
hall
of
the
apartment
the
captain
called
out
to
them
from
the
hurry
in
girls
there
another
letter
from
the
major
waiting
for
you
chapter
xix
the
unexpected
the
major
letter
did
nothing
however
to
lighten
the
gloom
on
the
contrary
it
only
increased
it
tenfold
the
main
substance
of
it
was
in
this
paragraph
it
singular
how
much
you
can
dig
out
about
a
subject
once
you
put
your
mind
to
it
i
thought
at
first
that
i
had
told
you
all
that
was
known
about
jack
carringford
and
his
affairs
all
that
could
be
discovered
but
the
deeper
i
go
into
it
the
more
i
seem
to
unearth
yesterday
another
friend
to
whom
i
had
written
on
the
of
getting
a
little
information
but
from
whom
i
really
did
expect
much
sent
me
this
bit
of
news
it
seems
he
heard
it
said
that
after
carringford
went
back
to
england
he
married
again
and
it
is
thought
that
he
did
not
live
very
long
after
died
suddenly
of
pneumonia
or
something
like
it
in
an
obscure
town
in
the
north
of
england
perhaps
this
will
help
you
some
in
your
amateur
detective
work
if
i
glean
any
more
information
i
let
you
know
at
once
i
rather
enjoy
this
delving
into
the
past
oh
horrors
exclaimed
marcia
could
anything
be
plainer
than
this
is
getting
to
be
of
course
that
explains
it
all
cecily
did
remember
her
father
and
her
was
really
her
stepmother
i
wonder
if
she
knows
it
she
never
mentioned
it
but
then
she
seldom
speaks
of
her
mother
anyway
though
i
always
thought
from
the
way
she
acted
that
she
was
very
fond
of
her
it
certainly
grows
more
convincing
with
every
added
piece
of
news
we
hear
mused
the
captain
i
wish
we
find
some
loophole
for
thinking
that
this
tangle
does
concern
cecily
but
how
on
earth
she
can
have
any
chinese
ancestry
beats
me
she
does
show
a
trace
of
it
one
would
certainly
think
she
have
almond
eyes
and
coarse
straight
hair
or
a
dark
complexion
or
it
the
one
thing
that
gives
me
the
slightest
hope
that
she
ca
be
carringford
daughter
but
what
shall
we
do
now
questioned
janet
bringing
them
back
abruptly
to
the
affairs
of
the
moment
the
first
thing
to
do
declared
captain
brett
is
to
question
cecily
about
her
father
and
mother
and
see
what
knows
she
may
recall
something
that
will
give
us
another
clue
if
this
proves
to
be
the
right
trail
we
got
to
follow
it
up
get
into
communication
with
the
carringfords
in
england
and
see
if
they
will
do
anything
about
her
they
ought
to
be
willing
to
provide
for
his
daughter
but
we
have
to
be
very
sure
of
our
facts
or
they
pay
no
attention
i
suppose
somehow
or
other
we
have
to
trace
out
carringford
career
in
england
after
he
returned
i
wish
i
knew
the
name
he
assumed
but
no
one
seems
to
be
able
to
tell
us
that
but
even
we
have
the
slightest
clue
to
the
reason
why
cecily
was
sent
to
miss
benedict
mused
marcia
why
yes
we
have
something
new
now
interrupted
janet
has
it
occurred
to
you
that
carringford
second
wife
might
have
been
some
connection
of
the
benedicts
or
known
them
or
something
sure
enough
sure
enough
cried
the
captain
thumping
his
knee
this
puts
the
thing
in
an
entirely
new
light
we
must
find
out
a
little
more
about
that
second
wife
you
get
what
you
can
from
cecily
but
do
be
careful
how
you
question
her
the
child
is
sensitive
and
was
apparently
very
fond
of
the
lady
she
called
her
mother
try
not
to
probe
too
deeply
and
remember
to
explain
to
her
that
you
are
not
asking
just
out
of
idle
curiosity
which
she
be
perfectly
right
in
resenting
it
was
with
no
very
pleasant
anticipations
that
marcia
and
janet
looked
forward
to
their
interview
with
cecily
next
afternoon
how
to
approach
the
subject
without
giving
her
a
clue
to
the
real
state
of
affairs
they
were
puzzled
to
know
plan
after
plan
they
formed
only
to
reject
after
thinking
them
over
suppose
cecily
should
ask
this
or
what
if
cecily
should
inquire
why
we
say
that
spoiled
every
outline
of
the
conversation
that
they
could
imagine
at
last
janet
declared
it
perfectly
useless
to
think
now
what
we
say
or
what
answer
let
just
wait
till
the
time
comes
and
say
what
seems
best
at
the
moment
the
whole
conversation
may
be
entirely
different
from
anything
we
plan
i
guess
you
right
sighed
marcia
i
tired
out
thinking
about
it
anyhow
and
so
they
put
it
all
aside
till
cecily
arrival
when
she
came
that
afternoon
she
found
two
very
serious
and
thoughtful
friends
awaiting
her
one
thing
at
least
they
had
determined
not
to
put
off
the
dreaded
interview
till
later
in
the
day
but
have
it
over
at
once
and
get
it
off
their
minds
so
when
they
were
all
comfortably
seated
in
marcia
cozy
room
janet
began
cecily
would
you
mind
very
much
if
we
asked
you
a
few
questions
you
remember
the
other
day
we
said
that
something
had
come
up
concerning
you
we
thought
and
we
would
tell
you
about
it
later
well
we
quite
ready
to
tell
you
about
it
yet
but
it
would
help
a
great
deal
if
you
answer
a
few
questions
about
yourself
will
you
and
she
felt
an
immense
sensation
of
relief
after
these
words
were
spoken
at
having
at
least
taken
the
first
plunge
why
of
course
assented
cecily
wonderingly
that
is
if
i
possibly
can
and
you
remember
that
we
are
asking
just
out
of
curiosity
but
because
it
may
help
to
untangle
your
affairs
interrupted
marcia
anxiously
cecily
only
smiled
and
squeezed
her
hand
as
if
an
answer
to
that
were
unnecessary
well
dear
said
janet
in
a
hesitating
voice
could
you
tell
us
whether
you
know
this
was
your
father
ever
married
twice
cecily
started
and
flushed
a
little
oh
i
i
do
know
anything
about
such
a
thing
she
murmured
i
i
do
think
so
you
see
he
died
before
i
remember
anything
about
him
and
my
mother
never
spoke
of
him
to
me
very
much
then
she
never
told
you
anything
about
that
went
on
janet
no
replied
cecily
very
positively
now
i
have
one
more
question
to
ask
that
i
afraid
may
startle
you
but
please
do
attach
too
much
importance
to
it
was
the
lady
you
called
mother
your
real
mother
or
your
stepmother
this
time
cecily
fairly
jumped
oh
no
no
she
cried
i
sure
very
sure
she
was
my
own
mother
she
would
certainly
have
told
me
if
she
had
not
been
i
would
have
known
it
why
do
you
ask
that
you
know
is
what
we
ca
just
explain
yet
answered
janet
evidently
distressed
were
you
very
very
fond
of
her
cecily
indeed
yes
replied
the
puzzled
girl
how
could
i
help
but
be
she
was
so
lovely
and
sweet
and
good
to
me
and
seemed
to
live
only
for
my
comfort
and
happiness
i
never
dreamed
of
such
a
thing
as
her
not
being
my
own
mother
there
were
real
tears
in
cecily
eyes
as
she
made
this
declaration
marcia
and
janet
experienced
as
unpleasant
a
sensation
as
if
they
had
been
compelled
to
torture
a
helpless
kitten
and
yet
the
task
must
be
gone
through
with
and
there
were
further
queries
to
make
do
forgive
us
for
all
this
cecily
begged
marcia
it
hurts
us
horribly
to
make
you
feel
badly
we
would
do
it
for
the
world
if
there
were
a
good
reason
but
can
you
tell
us
this
was
there
anything
your
mother
ever
said
or
did
that
would
in
any
way
suggest
that
she
might
not
be
your
own
mother
think
hard
cecily
dear
the
girl
sat
a
long
while
chin
in
hand
staring
out
of
the
window
at
the
tightly
shuttered
expanse
of
benedict
folly
opposite
no
one
spoke
and
the
others
made
a
vain
pretense
of
working
hard
at
their
embroidery
but
the
hands
of
both
shook
so
that
the
stitches
were
very
very
crooked
indeed
at
last
cecily
turned
to
them
and
spoke
in
a
very
subdued
voice
these
things
are
making
me
very
unhappy
but
i
know
you
only
mean
them
for
my
good
my
mother
did
say
one
or
two
things
that
i
thought
nothing
of
at
the
time
but
now
since
your
questions
seem
as
if
they
may
have
another
meaning
one
was
this
we
were
looking
in
the
mirror
together
one
time
and
i
said
how
queer
it
was
that
i
did
look
a
bit
like
her
i
was
so
fair
and
and
had
rosy
cheeks
and
she
was
dark
and
her
eyes
were
brown
and
her
hair
almost
black
she
smiled
and
said
it
is
very
strange
when
you
think
and
then
stopped
very
suddenly
and
flushed
quite
red
and
i
asked
her
what
she
meant
but
she
only
replied
nothing
nothing
dear
children
often
look
very
different
from
their
parents
not
at
all
like
them
and
she
say
any
more
i
thought
it
strange
for
a
while
but
soon
forgot
all
about
it
i
ca
imagine
now
what
she
meant
unless
it
was
that
the
only
other
thing
i
remember
is
this
i
asked
her
one
time
whether
when
i
was
a
tiny
little
baby
i
wore
pink
or
blue
bows
on
my
dresses
she
was
very
busy
about
something
at
the
time
and
she
just
said
sort
of
do
know
i
sure
and
then
she
added
in
a
great
hurry
i
do
remember
pink
i
guess
i
thought
it
strange
that
she
should
forget
how
she
dressed
me
for
she
always
had
a
very
good
memory
but
i
forgot
that
too
very
soon
that
is
all
marcia
and
janet
glanced
uneasily
at
each
other
the
information
seemed
to
confirm
their
worst
apprehensions
but
janet
went
on
just
one
more
question
dear
and
we
stop
this
horrid
inquisition
can
you
tell
us
what
was
your
mother
maiden
name
the
name
of
her
people
yes
said
cecily
it
was
treadwell
but
she
had
any
people
left
they
were
all
dead
and
she
was
the
last
one
of
her
family
but
oh
ca
you
tell
me
girls
why
you
have
had
to
ask
all
these
questions
i
have
waited
so
patiently
and
i
have
worried
so
about
it
all
and
what
you
have
said
has
made
me
feel
worse
than
ever
dear
heart
we
do
want
to
tell
you
quite
yet
soothed
marcia
it
would
do
you
any
good
to
know
about
it
till
we
positive
beyond
a
doubt
it
is
anything
so
very
terrible
anyhow
nothing
to
worry
about
at
all
but
just
something
we
wish
might
be
a
little
different
and
nothing
could
possibly
make
the
least
difference
in
the
way
we
care
for
you
anyway
so
just
do
worry
another
bit
now
i
going
to
play
for
you
and
she
drew
her
violin
from
its
case
marcia
gave
them
quite
a
concert
that
afternoon
rendering
selection
after
selection
to
please
them
glad
indeed
of
the
diversion
and
relief
from
the
unpleasantness
of
their
accomplished
task
but
she
did
not
play
the
träumerei
for
some
reason
not
very
well
defined
even
to
herself
but
vaguely
connected
with
recent
disclosures
at
last
cecily
herself
asked
for
it
and
then
of
course
marcia
could
not
refrain
from
obliging
her
when
it
was
over
cecily
took
her
departure
and
the
girls
left
alone
plunged
at
once
into
the
discussion
of
the
most
recent
developments
of
the
mystery
that
evening
captain
brett
and
the
two
girls
held
a
council
of
war
there
no
denying
he
said
we
discovered
the
most
important
thing
yet
in
learning
that
name
treadwell
we
something
to
work
from
now
with
that
to
start
from
i
can
set
on
foot
some
inquiries
over
in
england
that
may
establish
her
identity
and
you
must
ask
miss
benedict
though
i
hate
to
be
constantly
troubling
her
in
this
way
if
she
has
any
recollection
of
some
one
by
that
name
who
could
possibly
have
any
claim
on
her
do
this
as
soon
as
possible
we
certain
to
get
at
the
root
of
the
matter
very
soon
now
do
you
think
asked
marcia
that
those
remarks
of
her
mother
that
cecily
repeated
look
as
if
we
were
right
in
believing
it
to
be
her
stepmother
it
certainly
seems
so
to
me
he
acknowledged
of
course
we
must
remember
this
when
you
have
a
suspicion
that
certain
things
are
so
every
little
circumstance
and
every
lightest
remark
seem
to
confirm
you
in
that
belief
often
these
things
have
absolutely
no
bearing
on
it
whatever
but
you
they
have
simply
because
you
fear
that
they
have
or
want
them
to
have
so
we
must
be
misled
by
chance
remarks
i
will
admit
however
that
these
particular
ones
seem
singularly
to
bear
us
out
in
our
conjectures
well
do
let
get
some
of
these
things
settled
sighed
marcia
i
losing
so
much
sleep
over
it
that
i
beginning
to
feel
like
an
owl
i
just
worry
and
worry
all
night
long
it
seems
to
me
ask
miss
benedict
about
the
name
of
treadwell
when
we
go
there
if
we
can
possibly
manage
to
see
her
i
sorry
to
disappoint
you
about
that
interrupted
the
captain
but
i
afraid
i
have
to
ask
you
to
remain
at
home
i
due
downtown
on
some
errands
that
will
take
me
to
a
number
of
places
and
at
the
same
time
i
expecting
an
important
business
message
over
the
telephone
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
to
be
here
without
fail
to
take
the
message
for
me
i
ca
trust
eliza
to
get
it
right
so
you
have
to
put
off
your
visit
for
another
day
but
do
be
too
much
disappointed
for
while
i
away
i
shall
be
making
inquiries
as
to
how
we
must
go
about
tracing
the
name
of
treadwell
in
england
that
will
be
something
accomplished
and
with
this
consolation
the
girls
had
to
be
content
now
said
janet
next
morning
when
the
captain
had
gone
and
they
had
resigned
themselves
to
a
long
day
of
waiting
i
have
a
plan
to
propose
let
not
talk
or
even
a
thing
about
all
this
business
if
we
do
we
only
make
ourselves
more
miserable
than
we
are
i
found
a
perfectly
fascinating
new
book
in
the
library
yesterday
let
sit
and
read
it
turn
about
and
see
if
we
ca
both
finish
those
centerpieces
we
been
working
on
so
long
we
have
to
work
like
everything
to
do
it
that
ought
to
keep
our
minds
off
of
our
troubles
and
telephone
for
some
french
pastry
for
dessert
at
luncheon
and
some
candy
for
this
afternoon
the
plan
seemed
to
offer
pleasant
possibilities
and
they
both
settled
themselves
comfortably
in
the
cool
to
pass
the
morning
the
book
was
well
begun
and
the
embroidery
advancing
rapidly
when
eliza
came
in
with
a
letter
just
left
in
the
box
and
deposited
it
on
the
library
table
it
for
the
captain
she
announced
as
she
turned
away
marcia
jumped
up
and
scrutinized
the
writing
oh
janet
she
exclaimed
at
once
it
from
the
major
it
is
cried
her
friend
apprehensively
then
it
some
more
horrid
news
he
unearthed
i
certain
of
it
not
a
letter
comes
from
him
but
it
something
to
worry
us
more
i
just
hate
the
sight
of
them
yes
and
what
more
moaned
marcia
we
ca
even
know
what
in
this
one
till
father
comes
home
this
evening
why
i
feel
as
if
i
go
crazy
having
to
wait
all
that
time
well
you
have
to
wait
commented
janet
philosophically
so
you
might
as
well
do
it
as
peacefully
as
you
can
come
let
go
on
with
our
book
it
was
all
very
well
to
speak
philosophically
about
the
matter
however
but
to
so
was
a
different
affair
try
as
they
might
they
could
not
from
that
moment
concentrate
their
minds
on
the
pleasant
program
they
had
mapped
out
for
themselves
a
dozen
times
during
the
morning
marcia
would
stop
reading
and
glance
speculatively
at
the
unopened
letter
a
dozen
times
janet
left
her
and
strolled
over
to
inspect
the
superscription
anew
the
french
pastry
at
luncheon
failed
to
soothe
them
and
the
candy
in
the
afternoon
remained
uneaten
at
three
they
took
to
staring
out
of
the
window
to
watch
for
the
captain
return
and
as
they
watched
they
detailed
to
each
other
the
various
things
they
surmised
might
be
in
the
major
letter
marcia
asserted
that
he
had
probably
discovered
the
second
wife
name
to
be
treadwell
thus
confirming
their
worst
fears
and
janet
declared
that
he
had
no
doubt
ascertained
just
why
cecily
had
been
sent
to
the
benedict
home
perhaps
it
was
even
to
prevent
her
being
sent
back
to
china
to
her
mandarin
grandfather
nothing
they
could
imagine
was
too
dreadful
to
fit
into
the
scheme
of
things
by
half
past
five
they
were
the
most
miserable
pair
of
girls
in
the
big
city
and
at
that
moment
they
heard
the
captain
key
in
the
hall
door
quick
quick
quick
they
breathlessly
panted
at
him
explaining
nothing
but
only
waving
the
major
letter
in
his
face
asking
no
questions
he
took
it
slit
it
open
and
glanced
hurriedly
through
the
contents
then
he
gave
a
long
low
whistle
oh
tell
us
groaned
marcia
what
more
that
quite
horrible
has
he
found
out
for
answer
the
captain
sat
down
and
laughed
till
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
at
last
he
managed
to
gasp
well
of
all
the
dances
i
ever
been
led
this
is
the
worst
and
most
foolish
but
it
just
like
the
major
he
always
was
the
most
impulsive
chap
you
be
delighted
to
know
that
he
made
one
more
discovery
and
that
is
that
he
has
been
up
the
wrong
tree
as
they
say
here
what
he
writes
it
occurred
to
me
yesterday
in
connection
with
this
affair
to
look
up
some
of
the
old
diaries
i
used
to
keep
in
the
china
days
they
have
been
stored
away
in
the
attic
in
a
chest
for
years
but
i
got
them
out
and
have
been
running
over
them
hoping
to
come
across
an
entry
that
might
have
some
bearing
on
the
matter
in
question
and
quite
to
my
chagrin
i
did
discover
this
i
will
quote
it
just
as
it
stands
carringford
was
married
according
to
native
customs
none
of
us
but
here
the
point
of
departure
so
to
speak
this
entry
was
made
on
march
and
you
see
it
does
agree
at
all
with
the
inscription
on
your
bracelet
which
is
i
believe
september
so
of
course
the
only
inference
that
can
be
drawn
is
that
they
were
two
separate
and
distinct
affairs
that
have
absolutely
no
connection
so
sorry
anything
else
i
can
do
for
you
i
be
delighted
etc
the
captain
did
not
finish
the
remainder
of
the
letter
for
the
excellent
reason
that
no
one
of
his
audience
was
paying
the
least
attention
to
it
when
he
looked
up
at
this
point
marcia
was
prone
on
the
couch
alternately
sobbing
and
laughing
and
sobbing
again
and
janet
was
staring
out
of
the
window
blinking
hard
to
restrain
the
tears
of
relief
that
would
insist
on
rolling
down
her
cheeks
and
in
the
midst
of
this
curious
state
of
affairs
who
should
open
the
door
and
walk
in
but
aunt
minerva
suitcase
in
hand
she
stared
at
the
three
in
amazement
for
a
second
till
with
a
glad
cry
of
recognition
they
all
rushed
upon
her
and
literally
snowed
her
under
with
embraces
i
could
let
you
know
i
was
coming
because
i
did
know
myself
till
this
morning
she
explained
drusilla
sister
ellen
came
in
unexpectedly
from
the
west
and
of
course
that
relieved
me
i
just
packed
up
in
half
an
hour
and
here
i
am
whatever
is
the
matter
with
you
all
when
i
came
in
you
looked
as
if
you
just
attended
the
funeral
of
your
last
friend
i
hope
eliza
has
given
you
all
indigestion
we
tell
you
after
dinner
minerva
laughed
the
captain
it
a
long
and
complicated
tale
my
but
we
glad
to
see
you
again
that
evening
they
made
her
sit
down
and
listen
while
they
rehearsed
the
story
it
had
to
begin
with
the
description
of
their
day
on
shipboard
the
very
day
that
she
had
gone
away
and
ended
with
the
major
final
letter
she
listened
to
it
all
very
quietly
and
without
any
comments
whatever
except
for
an
indignant
and
scornful
sniff
once
in
a
while
well
demanded
marcia
when
it
was
over
and
they
were
waiting
for
her
to
speak
what
do
you
think
of
it
i
think
she
remarked
cryptically
that
you
needed
minerva
brett
here
to
manage
this
affair
for
you
would
have
given
you
a
little
better
advice
than
to
go
off
on
a
wild
goose
chase
down
to
pennsylvania
on
the
wrong
trail
they
stared
at
her
in
amazement
you
might
explain
yourself
minerva
mildly
suggested
the
captain
i
but
i
not
going
to
she
replied
firmly
at
least
not
just
at
present
and
with
a
tantalizing
smile
she
sweetly
bade
them
all
good
night
and
departed
to
her
room
janet
said
marcia
that
night
as
she
curled
her
arms
up
over
her
head
on
the
pillow
is
it
heavenly
to
go
to
sleep
with
that
horrid
weight
lifted
from
your
mind
we
seem
to
be
just
as
far
as
ever
from
solving
the
riddle
about
cecily
but
at
least
the
darling
is
the
granddaughter
of
a
mandarin
but
do
you
know
i
ca
help
but
wonder
where
that
poor
little
granddaughter
is
and
what
became
of
her
she
sort
of
seems
like
a
real
person
to
me
now
i
do
wonder
about
her
and
what
more
i
do
care
sighed
janet
as
long
as
it
was
cecily
what
puzzling
me
is
how
your
aunt
expects
to
solve
the
riddle
what
can
know
about
it
well
i
do
bother
about
returned
marcia
because
i
glad
to
let
somebody
else
have
a
hand
in
working
at
it
now
i
content
to
leave
it
to
aunt
minerva
chapter
xx
aunt
minerva
takes
command
for
an
entire
week
thereafter
aunt
minerva
went
her
own
mysterious
way
calm
and
unruffled
herself
but
keeping
the
rest
of
her
family
on
of
excitement
she
wrote
mysterious
letters
which
she
would
allow
no
one
but
herself
to
mail
and
received
mysterious
replies
the
contents
of
which
she
kept
a
dark
secret
they
watched
her
with
the
feeling
that
they
were
quite
outside
the
game
now
and
that
she
had
the
keys
of
the
situation
entirely
in
her
own
hands
which
was
indeed
the
truth
at
last
one
day
after
receiving
a
particularly
bulky
communication
she
deigned
to
speak
can
you
carry
a
message
for
me
to
miss
benedict
she
inquired
of
marcia
and
janet
yes
they
replied
eagerly
but
humbly
ask
her
if
she
could
possibly
grant
an
interview
in
her
own
house
to
the
four
of
us
here
and
one
other
it
very
important
oh
aunt
minerva
you
she
never
receives
strangers
in
the
house
expostulated
marcia
i
know
that
of
course
and
you
told
me
the
reason
which
i
quite
appreciate
but
there
bound
to
come
a
time
even
in
her
peculiar
experience
when
it
expedient
to
break
a
rule
like
that
the
time
has
come
now
and
you
can
tell
her
that
i
sure
she
be
very
sorry
if
she
does
not
grant
this
request
the
matter
intimately
concerns
her
or
i
would
not
dream
of
intruding
on
her
well
you
may
as
well
tell
what
you
been
concocting
minerva
interrupted
captain
brett
you
kept
us
in
the
dark
about
long
enough
have
you
and
if
i
to
go
in
there
with
the
procession
like
to
know
a
thing
or
two
about
where
i
at
instead
of
sitting
around
like
a
dummy
and
who
is
this
one
you
allude
to
anyway
miss
minerva
laughed
at
his
impatience
you
may
well
ask
edwin
i
think
you
must
have
been
about
as
blind
as
a
bat
not
to
see
right
along
what
struck
the
very
first
minute
after
you
told
me
what
the
things
on
that
bracelet
meant
as
soon
as
i
heard
the
word
the
idea
jumped
right
into
my
mind
about
two
months
ago
i
heard
a
most
wonderful
address
by
a
atwater
a
medical
missionary
from
china
whose
headquarters
are
at
the
hospital
in
and
you
can
easily
see
that
i
thought
of
him
at
once
when
by
jove
thundered
the
captain
striking
his
knee
with
his
fist
what
a
jolly
goose
i
been
not
to
have
thought
of
the
there
at
once
i
should
say
you
were
commented
miss
minerva
caustically
you
and
the
major
together
well
you
see
i
never
come
in
contact
with
them
much
began
the
captain
apologetically
never
mind
that
now
went
on
miss
minerva
i
thought
of
atwater
right
away
he
been
there
many
years
and
knows
something
about
most
every
one
in
the
region
i
guess
anyhow
i
decided
that
i
get
his
address
he
in
this
country
on
a
year
furlough
and
write
to
him
about
this
queer
case
and
i
did
and
he
has
answered
me
and
were
you
right
they
all
interrupted
i
was
right
she
announced
triumphantly
that
i
asked
him
to
come
and
tell
this
story
which
he
has
only
outlined
in
his
letter
in
full
to
miss
benedict
and
i
want
you
all
to
be
there
to
hear
it
and
what
more
i
not
going
to
tell
you
another
word
about
it
till
you
hear
it
from
him
so
it
no
use
to
tease
for
hints
go
right
in
and
ask
miss
benedict
when
she
can
arrange
for
this
interview
the
sooner
the
better
it
was
not
an
easy
matter
to
persuade
miss
benedict
to
grant
aunt
minerva
request
she
was
shy
and
timid
about
receiving
strangers
and
her
affection
of
the
eyes
as
well
as
her
curious
manner
of
living
made
it
hard
for
her
to
do
so
she
had
to
acknowledge
that
it
would
be
even
harder
to
see
them
elsewhere
nor
could
she
believe
that
the
affair
really
concerned
except
very
indirectly
through
cecily
perhaps
it
was
for
cecily
sake
alone
that
she
at
last
gave
a
reluctant
consent
assigning
the
following
wednesday
afternoon
as
the
appointed
time
and
the
intervening
two
days
was
spent
by
them
all
in
a
restless
fever
of
expectation
all
at
least
except
aunt
minerva
on
wednesday
afternoon
atwater
arrived
at
the
apartment
and
was
taken
in
charge
at
once
by
miss
minerva
who
guarded
him
like
a
dragon
lest
a
hint
of
the
important
secret
should
slip
out
before
the
appointed
time
he
was
a
tall
angular
man
with
a
gray
vandyke
beard
and
his
face
was
grave
in
repose
but
he
talked
brightly
and
interestingly
and
had
the
jolliest
laugh
in
the
world
the
girls
thought
him
very
unlike
their
preconceived
notions
of
a
missionary
he
and
the
captain
fraternized
at
once
exchanging
tales
of
the
far
east
to
which
janet
and
marcia
listened
in
absorbed
wonder
but
at
last
aunt
minerva
was
ready
and
the
procession
as
the
captain
insisted
on
calling
it
filed
into
the
street
and
proceeded
to
the
gate
of
benedict
folly
so
unusual
was
the
sight
of
the
little
crowd
waiting
to
be
admitted
where
no
admittance
had
been
granted
in
so
many
years
that
every
stared
at
them
miss
benedict
opened
the
gate
bonneted
and
veiled
as
usual
and
marcia
made
the
introductions
as
best
she
could
to
which
miss
replies
were
murmured
so
low
that
no
one
could
hear
them
then
she
led
the
way
to
the
house
and
into
the
darkened
parlor
where
they
all
sat
down
with
a
sensation
of
heavy
constraint
after
that
cecily
came
in
and
was
presented
to
atwater
he
started
slightly
when
he
saw
her
and
looked
into
her
face
long
and
scrutinizingly
in
the
dim
light
when
miss
benedict
had
removed
her
bonnet
and
veil
aunt
minerva
broke
the
silence
miss
benedict
i
have
brought
atwater
here
because
i
have
discovered
that
he
has
something
to
tell
you
something
that
will
be
of
intense
interest
to
you
i
know
this
may
seem
incredible
but
i
can
only
beg
that
you
will
do
us
the
favor
to
listen
miss
benedict
inclined
her
head
without
speaking
and
aunt
minerva
continued
you
have
heard
i
believe
about
the
curious
incident
of
the
bracelets
but
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
heard
about
the
translation
of
the
strange
characters
on
them
miss
benedict
murmured
that
she
had
not
and
miss
minerva
explained
it
as
briefly
as
she
could
then
she
went
on
atwater
here
is
a
medical
missionary
from
amoy
and
i
have
found
that
he
not
only
knew
the
owner
of
the
bracelets
but
has
some
personal
recollections
about
them
that
we
think
will
concern
you
will
you
listen
to
atwater
if
you
please
miss
benedict
again
bowed
in
assent
and
atwater
began
in
an
easy
conversational
tone
miss
brett
has
remarked
correctly
that
i
knew
the
owner
of
the
bracelets
and
all
about
the
characters
on
them
and
a
good
deal
of
the
story
connected
with
them
by
sheer
chance
or
rather
perhaps
i
ought
to
say
by
very
good
reasoning
she
has
hit
on
about
the
only
person
living
now
who
does
know
anything
about
them
here
the
story
a
good
many
years
ago
in
amoy
i
was
quite
a
doctor
then
i
was
thrown
in
with
a
clever
young
fellow
who
had
recently
landed
there
having
come
on
a
from
america
he
seemed
rather
at
loose
ends
so
to
speak
did
know
the
language
did
have
any
money
did
know
what
to
do
with
himself
did
have
any
occupation
and
spent
most
of
his
time
wandering
aimlessly
about
the
town
he
was
a
fine
upstanding
straightforward
chap
he
said
his
name
was
archibald
ferris
but
he
evidently
had
something
on
his
mind
for
he
was
gloomy
and
depressed
it
began
to
worry
me
for
fear
he
drift
into
trouble
if
he
kept
on
that
way
so
i
tried
to
get
him
interested
in
my
own
work
and
invited
him
to
go
around
with
me
on
some
of
my
long
tours
we
did
have
any
hospital
then
and
i
had
to
go
about
from
town
to
town
doing
my
medical
work
as
i
went
he
came
with
me
very
gladly
and
was
of
a
good
deal
of
assistance
and
we
grew
to
be
firm
friends
but
i
realized
there
was
something
he
was
pining
for
and
after
a
long
while
he
confessed
to
me
what
it
was
he
wanted
a
he
adored
music
played
well
but
had
lost
or
parted
from
his
instrument
in
some
way
he
did
explain
that
just
then
well
a
missionary
salary
is
munificent
so
i
could
very
well
grant
his
wish
out
of
my
own
pocket
much
as
i
wanted
to
the
best
i
could
do
was
to
get
him
a
position
in
a
chinese
house
in
amoy
where
he
could
earn
the
money
himself
it
was
better
for
him
to
be
regularly
occupied
anyway
after
a
few
months
he
had
saved
a
sufficient
sum
and
sent
off
to
shanghai
for
his
coveted
treasure
he
could
wait
to
get
it
over
from
america
after
it
came
he
was
actually
happy
for
a
while
he
a
marvelous
musician
for
his
age
i
admit
and
he
could
hold
us
spellbound
an
entire
evening
at
a
time
with
his
bow
the
natives
adored
him
and
gave
him
the
name
ê
lâng
or
of
melodies
well
he
had
the
musical
temperament
and
after
his
violin
came
he
could
stay
long
in
the
but
got
to
going
about
with
me
again
on
my
tours
always
with
his
precious
violin
he
was
really
of
the
greatest
assistance
because
his
music
was
almost
as
good
as
an
anæsthetic
in
many
instances
could
calm
the
most
excitable
i
ever
came
across
it
was
on
one
of
these
tours
that
he
met
young
miss
cecily
marlowe
at
the
english
mission
in
at
this
point
every
one
gave
a
little
start
of
surprise
and
looked
toward
cecily
who
alone
sat
gazing
and
absorbed
at
atwater
she
was
a
wonderfully
beautiful
girl
he
continued
with
a
color
like
english
roses
in
her
cheeks
the
chinese
called
her
or
she
had
but
recently
come
to
the
mission
from
her
home
in
england
well
it
was
a
case
of
love
at
first
sight
on
both
sides
and
before
many
more
months
ferris
announced
to
me
that
he
was
going
back
into
the
position
at
the
and
there
earn
enough
money
to
be
able
to
marry
her
but
he
also
told
me
that
miss
marlowe
while
very
much
in
love
with
him
was
still
very
devoted
to
her
work
there
and
very
earnest
about
the
cause
for
which
she
had
left
her
home
and
come
so
far
to
serve
she
insisted
that
if
they
married
she
must
still
be
allowed
to
continue
in
the
missionary
work
to
this
he
was
perfectly
willing
to
assent
so
they
were
married
in
the
english
mission
at
amoy
and
on
the
he
gave
her
this
pair
of
bracelets
which
he
had
had
made
after
his
own
design
they
were
not
an
expensive
gift
but
he
was
poor
in
worldly
goods
and
it
was
the
best
he
could
afford
after
the
honeymoon
they
built
a
little
home
on
the
island
of
right
near
the
city
of
amoy
he
went
on
with
his
work
in
the
and
she
with
her
teaching
in
the
on
the
island
it
seemed
an
ideal
arrangement
and
they
were
ideally
happy
for
a
number
of
years
he
never
advanced
very
far
in
the
for
he
loved
his
music
too
well
and
he
had
no
head
for
business
but
he
made
enough
to
keep
them
comfortably
and
more
they
did
not
want
then
about
i
think
came
a
change
to
their
great
joy
a
little
daughter
was
born
to
them
she
was
a
beautiful
baby
and
for
over
a
year
there
was
no
happier
home
in
all
china
but
one
day
when
the
baby
was
about
a
year
and
a
half
old
ferris
came
to
me
and
told
me
he
was
in
trouble
and
wanted
my
advice
he
began
by
telling
me
that
the
baby
seemed
to
be
drooping
and
that
he
himself
was
not
feeling
quite
up
to
the
mark
i
looked
them
both
over
and
found
he
was
right
the
climate
was
too
much
for
them
it
is
for
many
foreigners
sooner
or
later
i
told
him
they
ought
to
go
home
for
a
year
or
so
and
recuperate
he
said
he
could
did
have
any
home
to
go
to
in
fact
had
long
ago
quarreled
violently
with
his
people
and
would
never
go
back
to
them
moreover
he
had
his
wife
and
baby
to
consider
he
could
afford
to
give
up
and
lose
his
position
if
he
did
what
were
they
to
do
i
suggested
that
they
go
to
his
wife
people
in
england
he
said
there
was
difficulty
in
that
direction
too
she
had
only
a
married
brother
and
his
wife
and
they
had
not
approved
of
her
giving
up
all
her
prospects
to
come
to
china
as
a
missionary
they
heard
from
them
only
at
long
intervals
though
recently
to
be
sure
they
had
offered
to
take
care
of
the
little
girl
if
the
time
came
that
she
needed
change
of
air
ferris
told
me
that
he
and
his
wife
naturally
could
not
bear
to
consider
such
a
thing
but
on
the
other
hand
the
baby
welfare
must
be
their
first
consideration
what
should
i
advise
them
to
do
i
considered
the
matter
carefully
and
at
last
told
him
he
better
accept
the
offer
to
care
for
the
baby
for
a
year
or
so
she
at
least
would
be
provided
for
and
he
and
his
wife
could
then
take
their
chances
without
imperiling
her
future
to
follow
this
advice
nearly
broke
their
hearts
but
the
next
missionaries
who
went
back
to
england
on
furlough
took
the
baby
with
them
and
gave
her
into
the
care
of
the
brother
and
his
wife
it
is
needless
to
say
that
cecily
ferris
is
the
same
whom
we
know
as
cecily
marlowe
i
would
recognize
her
anywhere
for
she
is
the
image
of
her
mother
and
he
looked
toward
the
girl
sitting
in
the
dim
light
held
by
the
wonder
of
his
story
the
silence
that
ensued
was
broken
first
by
her
tell
me
if
you
please
she
half
whispered
did
my
father
ever
ever
play
to
me
on
his
violin
do
you
know
what
he
played
why
i
sure
he
did
smiled
atwater
i
used
to
stop
at
his
house
early
in
the
evening
sometimes
and
i
generally
found
him
fiddling
away
by
the
side
of
your
cradle
mostly
it
was
an
air
he
called
or
something
like
that
i
not
very
good
at
remembering
musical
names
i
knew
it
i
i
heard
it
somewhere
over
and
over
again
when
i
was
little
she
cried
and
yet
i
never
could
remember
anything
else
about
it
he
used
to
say
it
was
his
favorite
remarked
atwater
suddenly
miss
benedict
spoke
for
the
first
time
during
the
recital
there
was
a
tremble
of
suppressed
excitement
in
her
voice
is
that
all
the
story
oh
no
resumed
atwater
there
not
much
more
to
tell
but
sorry
to
say
the
rest
is
not
very
cheerful
after
the
baby
departure
ferris
health
failed
perceptibly
he
finally
gave
up
his
position
but
ferris
kept
on
with
her
work
and
nursed
him
as
well
but
the
strain
of
all
this
began
to
tell
on
her
and
at
last
in
i
advised
her
to
take
a
holiday
and
go
north
to
tientsin
with
her
husband
to
recuperate
we
missionaries
raised
enough
among
ourselves
to
finance
this
little
vacation
for
them
before
he
went
however
ferris
had
a
long
talk
with
me
one
day
and
confided
to
me
a
few
things
about
himself
and
his
past
to
begin
with
he
said
that
archibald
ferris
was
not
his
right
name
he
had
assumed
it
at
a
certain
period
of
his
life
because
he
had
broken
away
from
his
family
and
did
not
deem
it
best
that
what
remained
of
that
family
should
ever
know
he
existed
they
probably
thought
him
dead
in
fact
he
was
sure
that
they
did
and
his
return
to
existence
so
far
as
they
were
concerned
would
simply
complicate
family
affairs
only
his
wife
knew
who
these
relatives
were
he
had
recently
however
sent
word
to
his
wife
brother
that
should
anything
ever
happen
by
which
cecily
would
be
left
alone
she
should
be
sent
to
america
and
placed
in
the
care
of
this
family
whose
name
he
had
given
them
under
the
seal
of
secrecy
if
the
brother
and
his
wife
were
unable
or
unwilling
to
provide
for
her
he
also
sent
one
of
the
bracelets
to
england
to
be
given
to
his
little
daughter
requesting
that
she
be
always
allowed
to
keep
it
the
mother
always
wore
the
other
one
he
was
very
much
depressed
that
day
and
told
me
besides
that
his
career
had
been
wrecked
in
the
beginning
that
he
had
dreamed
of
being
a
great
violinist
but
had
been
thwarted
in
strange
ways
however
he
declared
that
his
life
in
china
had
been
happy
beyond
words
except
for
the
unhappy
present
then
he
bade
me
as
he
was
starting
for
tientsin
the
next
day
atwater
stopped
abruptly
and
swallowed
hard
as
if
what
he
had
to
tell
next
came
with
an
effort
he
went
on
presently
it
was
at
the
time
of
the
boxer
uprising
ferris
and
his
wife
had
almost
reached
tientsin
when
the
trouble
broke
out
there
and
they
were
never
seen
alive
again
he
stopped
and
there
was
a
tense
silence
in
the
room
at
last
he
continued
i
have
always
blamed
myself
for
having
been
the
unwitting
cause
of
their
death
i
had
advised
them
to
go
to
tientsin
though
of
course
i
could
not
foresee
the
dark
days
that
were
about
to
come
i
wish
with
all
my
soul
that
i
had
not
done
so
that
i
had
perhaps
sent
them
somewhere
else
but
it
is
irrevocable
now
there
is
no
use
dwelling
on
the
past
doubtless
that
is
how
the
other
bracelet
came
to
be
cast
loose
on
the
oriental
world
probably
it
was
stolen
at
the
time
and
passed
from
hand
to
hand
till
it
came
into
the
possession
of
captain
brett
it
is
a
strange
coincidence
that
brought
it
back
at
last
to
its
mate
it
became
my
sad
duty
to
notify
marlowe
of
the
tragedy
in
his
reply
a
frank
manly
letter
he
expressed
his
regret
that
a
difference
of
opinion
had
ever
interrupted
the
cordiality
of
his
relations
with
his
sister
and
her
husband
and
said
that
as
he
and
his
wife
already
loved
little
cecily
devotedly
they
would
adopt
her
as
their
own
they
were
reluctant
to
have
her
childhood
shadowed
by
her
parents
sorrowful
story
and
so
believed
it
best
that
she
should
never
know
that
she
was
not
indeed
their
daughter
cecily
marlowe
well
that
is
the
story
of
the
man
who
called
himself
archibald
ferris
said
atwater
he
looked
about
him
inquiringly
and
added
i
hope
that
my
telling
it
has
given
all
the
enlightenment
that
was
expected
during
his
long
recital
every
one
had
sat
with
eyes
fastened
upon
him
and
no
one
of
his
audience
had
a
thought
for
the
other
now
that
it
was
over
they
each
drew
a
long
breath
and
settled
back
in
their
chairs
and
then
for
the
first
time
they
noticed
the
curious
conduct
of
miss
benedict
she
was
sitting
far
forward
in
her
chair
her
big
gray
eyes
almost
starting
from
her
head
her
hands
clutching
the
arms
of
the
chair
till
the
blue
veins
stood
out
on
her
forehead
were
great
beads
of
perspiration
and
she
drew
her
breath
in
little
gasps
quite
unconscious
of
their
united
gaze
she
leaned
forward
and
touched
atwater
arm
with
an
imploring
hand
was
there
was
there
no
way
of
of
ascertaining
his
name
she
stammered
atwater
looked
at
her
with
compassion
in
his
kindly
eyes
i
know
of
but
one
thing
that
might
have
served
as
an
identification
he
conceded
when
i
was
giving
him
the
medical
examination
i
noticed
on
his
left
upper
arm
two
small
initials
surrounded
by
a
tiny
row
of
dots
they
were
just
such
a
mark
as
small
boys
often
tattoo
themselves
with
in
indelible
ink
and
of
course
they
are
there
for
life
doubtless
he
had
so
decorated
himself
with
his
initials
in
his
boyhood
days
oh
what
the
initials
interrupted
miss
benedict
in
a
stifled
voice
they
were
replied
atwater
with
a
little
choking
cry
miss
benedict
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
oh
it
ca
it
be
they
heard
her
murmur
then
in
an
instant
she
had
collected
herself
and
gazed
about
at
them
all
amazement
and
incredulity
in
her
lovely
eyes
my
friends
she
spoke
very
quietly
i
can
not
understand
what
this
means
my
brother
name
was
sydney
benedict
and
i
remember
when
as
a
boy
he
had
tattooed
those
initials
on
his
left
arm
as
atwater
has
described
them
and
he
performed
wonderfully
on
the
violin
and
dreamed
only
of
being
a
great
artist
some
day
he
longed
to
go
abroad
and
study
but
my
father
would
not
hear
of
it
he
wished
his
only
son
to
enter
his
business
and
continue
it
after
him
they
were
both
and
had
many
terrible
quarrels
about
it
i
my
sister
and
i
sided
with
my
father
at
last
my
father
threatened
to
disinherit
sydney
if
he
did
not
accede
to
his
wishes
and
on
the
following
morning
it
was
his
birthday
we
found
only
a
note
pinned
to
his
pillow
saying
he
had
gone
away
forever
he
had
taken
with
him
only
his
violin
but
and
here
she
hesitated
gazing
around
inquiringly
on
the
company
i
can
not
understand
what
follows
two
weeks
later
we
received
word
from
a
steamer
that
had
just
arrived
in
europe
from
new
york
that
a
young
man
named
sydney
benedict
had
fallen
or
jumped
overboard
one
night
when
they
were
two
days
out
and
his
loss
was
not
discovered
till
next
day
only
his
violin
remained
in
the
cabin
he
was
certainly
lost
at
sea
i
can
not
understand
she
suddenly
pressed
both
hands
to
her
head
as
if
it
pained
her
wait
a
moment
cried
atwater
i
believe
i
can
explain
that
i
should
have
told
it
before
but
i
quite
forgot
there
was
so
much
to
tell
he
did
once
confide
to
me
apropos
of
some
little
adventure
we
had
had
together
on
one
of
my
trips
when
i
almost
lost
my
life
that
he
too
had
once
had
the
narrowest
kind
of
escape
from
death
he
said
that
on
leaving
america
he
had
taken
a
steamer
for
europe
hoping
to
find
the
means
to
study
there
they
had
passed
sandy
hook
however
before
he
became
violently
seasick
and
lay
in
his
berth
like
a
log
for
hours
on
the
second
night
it
became
so
stiflingly
hot
in
his
cabin
that
he
felt
he
must
get
to
the
deck
for
air
or
die
so
he
struggled
out
and
up
the
companionway
somehow
meeting
no
one
for
it
was
very
late
on
the
deck
he
crawled
in
behind
a
and
lay
in
a
rather
unprotected
outer
portion
of
the
deck
so
sick
that
he
scarcely
knew
where
he
was
or
how
dangerous
was
the
spot
he
had
chosen
all
of
a
sudden
the
vessel
gave
an
unusually
heavy
lurch
and
before
he
could
clutch
for
any
hold
he
was
catapulted
into
the
sea
curiously
enough
the
sudden
ducking
dispelled
his
horrible
sickness
and
when
he
came
to
the
surface
he
found
himself
striking
out
to
swim
useless
to
shout
for
help
from
the
great
steamer
which
had
already
passed
a
boat
length
beyond
him
but
he
was
a
strong
swimmer
the
night
was
warm
and
he
resolved
not
to
give
up
till
he
to
all
night
till
dawn
he
managed
to
keep
on
the
surface
swimming
and
floating
and
at
daylight
a
picked
him
up
numb
and
weary
and
ready
to
go
to
the
bottom
at
the
next
stroke
the
ship
on
which
he
found
himself
was
bound
for
china
and
of
course
he
had
to
along
working
his
passage
as
a
common
sailor
in
return
for
his
keep
it
was
then
i
suspect
that
he
made
up
his
mind
to
change
his
name
i
think
beyond
a
shadow
of
a
doubt
that
archibald
ferris
and
sydney
benedict
are
one
and
the
same
person
at
this
aunt
minerva
who
had
spoken
a
word
since
her
speech
of
introduction
put
on
her
glasses
and
swept
the
assembly
with
a
triumphant
gaze
the
girls
and
captain
brett
were
so
absorbed
that
they
could
not
utter
a
syllable
and
miss
benedict
sat
back
in
her
chair
in
a
stunned
silence
only
cecily
seemed
unconscious
enough
of
the
strain
to
do
the
natural
thing
she
rose
from
her
chair
and
went
over
to
miss
benedict
dropping
down
on
her
knees
beside
her
and
snuggling
her
head
on
the
older
woman
shoulder
with
a
confiding
movement
i
cecily
now
she
said
simply
and
i
i
love
you
aunt
alixe
i
glad
there
a
good
reason
why
i
was
sent
over
here
to
you
miss
benedict
looked
down
at
the
golden
head
and
the
terrible
tension
in
her
face
relaxed
sydney
child
my
little
cecily
they
heard
her
murmur
but
they
heard
no
more
for
at
this
point
aunt
minerva
arose
and
majestically
motioned
the
entire
company
out
of
the
room
chapter
xxi
six
months
later
janet
dear
i
know
you
think
i
a
wretch
not
to
have
written
in
so
long
but
honestly
things
have
been
happening
so
fast
that
i
do
have
time
to
sit
down
and
write
you
about
one
event
before
a
one
has
taken
place
i
missed
you
horribly
ever
since
you
went
back
to
northam
it
was
a
shame
that
you
had
to
leave
just
after
the
grand
of
our
mystery
for
you
been
missing
some
of
the
most
wonderful
parts
all
the
lovely
things
that
have
happened
since
i
think
i
already
written
you
about
some
of
the
changes
that
have
taken
place
in
benedict
folly
it
the
most
remarkable
thing
the
way
aunt
minerva
has
taken
that
place
miss
benedict
and
all
completely
under
her
wing
miss
benedict
who
by
the
way
wants
us
both
to
call
her
miss
alixe
seemed
completely
helpless
for
a
while
after
the
great
day
and
turned
to
aunt
minerva
for
pretty
nearly
everything
principally
advice
you
can
imagine
how
aunt
minerva
is
enjoying
herself
she
just
loves
nothing
better
than
managing
people
affairs
for
them
if
they
want
her
to
in
the
first
place
aunt
minerva
advised
her
to
get
the
house
into
livable
condition
and
find
suitable
servants
and
get
some
modern
clothes
and
as
poor
miss
alixe
acted
like
a
lost
kitten
in
going
about
it
aunt
minerva
just
took
hold
and
managed
the
whole
thing
and
you
never
recognize
our
dilapidated
old
house
of
mystery
now
it
so
changed
and
so
lovely
miss
alixe
has
decided
that
now
there
is
no
further
reason
for
her
not
using
their
large
fortune
and
everything
must
be
the
nicest
possible
for
sake
and
cecily
what
a
darling
she
is
of
course
we
are
simply
inseparable
she
has
even
begun
to
go
to
the
high
school
with
me
because
miss
alixe
aunt
minerva
have
decided
that
it
will
be
better
for
her
than
studying
with
a
private
tutor
she
is
the
happiest
thing
i
ever
saw
and
says
she
feels
as
if
she
were
living
in
a
all
the
time
we
are
just
longing
for
the
easter
vacation
to
come
and
your
visit
then
we
three
can
be
together
again
in
the
good
old
way
wo
it
be
glorious
but
this
is
all
aside
from
the
other
two
big
pieces
of
news
i
wanted
to
tell
you
almost
from
the
beginning
aunt
minerva
has
been
urging
miss
alixe
to
go
to
a
oculist
and
have
her
eyes
examined
and
at
last
a
few
weeks
ago
they
went
together
and
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
result
he
said
that
almost
without
a
doubt
her
sight
can
be
restored
with
proper
treatment
and
possibly
a
slight
operation
later
she
began
the
treatment
at
once
and
already
her
sight
is
much
improved
she
can
stand
a
stronger
light
and
has
those
awful
headaches
less
frequently
you
see
it
was
years
since
she
had
had
any
advice
about
them
and
they
made
great
strides
in
treatment
of
the
eyes
since
then
they
can
almost
do
the
impossible
we
are
all
so
happy
about
it
and
now
for
the
last
and
biggest
piece
of
news
perhaps
you
are
wondering
what
has
become
of
miss
alixe
mysterious
and
invisible
older
sister
and
it
is
about
her
that
i
going
to
tell
you
you
will
never
in
the
world
be
able
to
guess
what
has
happened
aunt
minerva
insisted
again
aunt
minerva
that
miss
alixe
must
have
one
of
the
big
alienists
that
what
they
call
specialists
in
mental
diseases
i
learned
see
miss
cornelia
the
sister
and
perhaps
he
could
tell
whether
anything
could
be
done
for
it
took
a
long
time
to
persuade
miss
alixe
that
there
was
any
use
in
doing
this
but
at
last
she
consented
i
think
she
has
always
been
very
sensitive
about
that
poor
sister
losing
her
mind
and
she
never
wanted
any
one
to
see
her
even
after
she
had
a
number
of
servants
in
the
house
she
would
let
any
one
wait
on
miss
cornelia
but
herself
well
the
great
doctor
came
and
was
there
for
hours
and
asked
a
terrific
lot
of
questions
all
about
everything
that
had
happened
for
years
and
years
he
learned
one
thing
that
interested
him
more
than
anything
else
he
said
do
you
remember
the
day
last
summer
when
we
were
there
sitting
in
the
garden
and
i
played
on
my
violin
how
miss
alixe
came
down
in
a
great
hurry
and
asked
me
to
stop
because
it
disturbed
her
sister
you
may
remember
too
that
i
was
playing
träumerei
had
played
it
twice
well
she
told
the
doctor
that
when
miss
cornelia
heard
that
she
acted
very
much
excited
cried
and
twisted
her
hands
and
tried
to
speak
she
has
spoken
an
intelligible
word
since
she
had
the
stroke
miss
alixe
also
told
him
how
their
favorite
brother
had
played
so
much
on
the
violin
particularly
that
same
air
he
said
this
was
a
most
hopeful
sign
it
indicated
that
conditions
were
now
such
that
there
was
a
possibility
of
her
reason
and
memory
and
even
speech
being
restored
provided
they
could
touch
just
the
right
note
of
association
after
he
had
thought
the
matter
over
a
long
time
he
decided
to
try
an
experiment
and
he
selected
me
little
insignificant
to
help
he
had
me
come
in
and
bring
my
violin
and
sit
in
the
room
with
miss
cornelia
a
little
behind
her
so
she
would
not
notice
me
particularly
then
he
had
miss
alixe
and
cecily
also
sitting
there
in
plain
sight
of
her
just
quietly
sewing
or
reading
and
not
paying
any
particular
attention
to
any
one
he
and
aunt
minerva
stayed
outside
watching
through
the
partly
opened
door
it
was
the
first
time
i
had
ever
seen
miss
cornelia
except
that
time
when
the
shutter
blew
open
and
janet
she
is
looking
entirely
different
from
what
i
had
imagined
she
is
large
and
stately
and
imposing
with
white
hair
like
miss
alixe
piled
under
a
lace
cap
and
great
black
eyes
she
just
sat
there
quietly
knitting
and
took
no
notice
of
any
one
you
would
not
have
known
that
there
was
anything
the
matter
with
her
except
that
her
face
was
almost
expressionless
as
if
she
was
thinking
of
anything
at
all
i
ca
describe
it
any
other
way
well
there
we
sat
and
at
a
given
signal
from
the
doctor
outside
the
door
i
was
to
begin
very
very
quietly
and
softly
to
play
the
träumerei
you
can
just
imagine
how
nervous
i
was
so
much
depended
on
my
doing
just
the
right
thing
my
hands
shook
and
my
knees
shook
and
my
heart
thumped
and
i
thought
i
should
never
be
able
even
to
hold
the
bow
it
seemed
an
age
before
the
doctor
raised
his
hand
as
a
signal
but
when
he
did
i
tucked
the
violin
under
my
chin
and
fairly
prayed
that
i
should
make
a
failure
of
my
part
anyway
and
i
played
the
träumerei
through
the
very
best
i
could
and
nothing
happened
miss
cornelia
went
right
on
knitting
and
never
noticed
it
at
all
then
the
doctor
made
another
signal
and
i
began
it
again
this
time
she
laid
down
her
knitting
closed
her
eyes
and
leaned
her
head
against
the
back
of
the
chair
and
when
i
finished
for
the
second
time
what
you
suppose
happened
she
opened
her
eyes
looked
over
at
miss
alixe
and
for
the
first
time
in
nearly
thirty
years
and
this
is
what
she
said
as
simply
and
quietly
as
though
all
those
thirty
years
had
never
elapsed
illustration
sydney
must
have
come
in
again
i
hear
him
practising
sydney
must
have
come
in
again
i
hear
him
practising
miss
alixe
was
so
startled
she
looked
ready
to
faint
away
but
she
managed
to
say
no
cornelia
but
i
tell
you
all
about
it
then
the
doctor
in
great
excitement
beckoned
us
all
to
come
out
of
the
room
quickly
and
leave
her
alone
with
miss
alixe
so
we
vanished
and
the
two
were
there
together
a
long
long
time
at
last
miss
alixe
sent
for
cecily
and
she
was
gone
a
long
time
too
when
it
was
all
over
the
doctor
said
it
was
the
most
successful
thing
that
had
ever
happened
in
all
his
experience
miss
cornelia
is
completely
restored
to
memory
and
speech
and
after
the
first
shock
of
learning
all
that
had
been
blank
to
her
for
these
past
years
she
rallied
well
and
is
now
resting
and
recuperating
under
the
care
of
miss
alixe
and
a
trained
nurse
she
still
finds
it
very
hard
to
realize
all
the
changes
that
have
happened
in
those
thirty
years
and
she
grieves
a
great
deal
over
the
death
of
her
brother
which
seems
very
recent
and
terrible
to
her
but
she
is
simply
devoted
to
cecily
and
cecily
is
growing
almost
as
fond
of
as
she
is
of
miss
alixe
next
summer
the
whole
family
is
going
with
us
to
spend
two
months
in
northam
aunt
doings
again
because
it
is
so
lovely
and
restful
there
and
wo
we
have
a
wonderful
summer
together
janet
dear
i
can
hardly
wait
for
the
time
to
come
well
that
is
all
the
news
i
have
to
tell
and
i
guess
agree
with
me
that
it
certainly
is
enough
and
very
satisfying
one
thing
amuses
me
to
pieces
janet
every
time
i
think
of
it
do
you
remember
how
when
you
first
came
to
visit
us
last
summer
i
was
explaining
to
you
all
i
discovered
about
benedict
folly
and
flattering
myself
with
the
idea
that
i
or
rather
you
and
i
would
work
out
the
puzzle
and
solve
the
mystery
all
by
ourselves
what
little
geese
we
were
a
lot
we
toward
unraveling
any
of
that
tangle
even
father
and
major
goodrich
were
way
off
the
track
it
took
aunt
minerva
the
darling
to
walk
right
in
and
clear
the
whole
thing
up
here
hurrah
then
for
aunt
minerva
she
certainly
had
the
laugh
on
however
i
sometimes
console
myself
with
the
thought
that
it
was
we
you
and
i
who
first
took
an
interest
in
that
shuttered
old
house
in
the
garden
if
we
had
who
knows
we
would
probably
never
have
met
cecily
and
things
would
be
just
the
same
as
ever
there
and
miss
alixe
would
have
but
what
the
use
of
going
into
all
that
the
girl
next
door
is
our
own
dearest
friend
now
and
everything
is
all
right
i
just
looked
out
of
the
window
and
saw
a
light
in
cecily
room
she
also
writing
to
you
we
promised
each
other
we
both
would
i
growing
sleepy
now
so
and
heaps
of
love
marcia
february
did
i
tell
you
this
before
i
wonder
cecily
has
both
the
bracelets
now
aunt
minerva
of
course
insisted
that
she
should
she
has
put
them
safely
away
and
will
never
part
with
them
again
but
we
take
them
out
and
look
at
them
sometimes
and
think
of
all
the
strange
and
awful
adventures
they
been
through
and
the
curious
chance
that
brought
them
together
again
always
after
we
looked
at
them
cecily
asks
me
to
play
the
träumerei
and
while
i
play
she
sits
very
quietly
and
says
nothing
and
her
eyes
have
a
look
but
i
know
what
she
is
thinking
about
the
end
