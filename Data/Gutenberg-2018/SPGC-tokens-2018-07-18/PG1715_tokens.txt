i
there
are
houses
in
certain
provincial
towns
whose
aspect
inspires
melancholy
akin
to
that
called
forth
by
sombre
cloisters
dreary
moorlands
or
the
desolation
of
ruins
within
these
houses
there
is
perhaps
the
silence
of
the
cloister
the
barrenness
of
moors
the
skeleton
of
ruins
life
and
movement
are
so
stagnant
there
that
a
stranger
might
think
them
uninhabited
were
it
not
that
he
encounters
suddenly
the
pale
cold
glance
of
a
motionless
person
whose
face
peers
beyond
the
at
the
sound
of
an
unaccustomed
step
such
elements
of
sadness
formed
the
physiognomy
as
it
were
of
a
in
saumur
which
stands
at
the
end
of
the
steep
street
leading
to
the
chateau
in
the
upper
part
of
the
town
this
street
now
little
frequented
hot
in
summer
cold
in
winter
dark
in
certain
sections
is
remarkable
for
the
resonance
of
its
little
pebbly
pavement
always
clean
and
dry
for
the
narrowness
of
its
tortuous
for
the
peaceful
stillness
of
its
houses
which
belong
to
the
old
town
and
are
by
the
ramparts
houses
three
centuries
old
are
still
solid
though
built
of
wood
and
their
divers
aspects
add
to
the
originality
which
commends
this
portion
of
saumur
to
the
attention
of
artists
and
antiquaries
it
is
difficult
to
pass
these
houses
without
admiring
the
enormous
oaken
beams
their
ends
carved
into
fantastic
figures
which
crown
with
a
black
the
lower
floor
of
most
of
them
in
one
place
these
transverse
timbers
are
covered
with
slate
and
mark
a
bluish
line
along
the
frail
wall
of
a
dwelling
covered
by
a
roof
which
bends
beneath
the
weight
of
years
and
whose
rotting
shingles
are
twisted
by
the
alternate
action
of
sun
and
rain
in
another
place
blackened
with
delicate
sculptures
now
scarcely
discernible

too
weak
to
bear
the
brown
clay
pots
from
which
springs
the
heart
or
the
of
some
poor
farther
on
are
doors
studded
with
enormous
nails
where
the
genius
of
our
forefathers
has
traced
domestic
hieroglyphics
of
which
the
meaning
is
now
lost
forever
here
a
protestant
attested
his
belief
there
a
leaguer
cursed
henry

elsewhere
some
bourgeois
has
carved
the
insignia
of
his
de
symbols
of
his
magisterial
glory
the
whole
history
of
france
is
there
next
to
a
tottering
house
with
roughly
plastered
walls
where
an
artisan
enshrines
his
tools
rises
the
mansion
of
a
country
gentleman
on
the
stone
arch
of
which
above
the
door
vestiges
of
armorial
bearings
may
still
be
seen
battered
by
the
many
revolutions
that
have
shaken
france
since
in
this
hilly
street
the
of
the
merchants
are
neither
shops
nor
warehouses
lovers
of
the
middle
ages
will
here
find
the
of
our
forefathers
in
all
its
naive
simplicity
these
low
rooms
which
have
no
no
in
fact
no
glass
at
all
are
deep
and
dark
and
without
interior
or
exterior
decoration
their
doors
open
in
two
parts
each
roughly
the
upper
half
is
fastened
back
within
the
room
the
lower
half
fitted
with
a

continually
to
and
fro

and
light
reach
the
damp
den
within
either
through
the
upper
half
of
the
door
or
through
an
open
space
between
the
ceiling
and
a
low
front
wall
which
is
closed
by
solid
shutters
that
are
taken
down
every
morning
put
up
every
evening
and
held
in
place
by
heavy
iron
bars
this
wall
serves
as
a
counter
for
the
merchandise
no
delusive
display
is
there
only
samples
of
the
business
whatever
it
may
chance
to
be
such
for
instance
as
three
or
four
tubs
full
of
codfish
and
salt

few
bundles
of
cordage

wire
hanging
from

a
neat
girl
glowing
with
youth
wearing
a
white
kerchief
her
arms
red
and
bare

knitting

calls
her
father
or
her
mother
one
of
whom
comes
forward
and
sells
you
what
you
want
phlegmatically
civilly
or
arrogantly
according
to
his
or
her
individual
character
whether
it
be
a
matter
of
two
sous
or
twenty
thousand
francs
worth
of
merchandise
you
may
see
a
cooper
for
instance
sitting
in
his
doorway
and
twirling
his
thumbs
as
he
talks
with
a
neighbor
to
all
appearance
he
owns
nothing
more
than
a
few
miserable
and
two
or
three
bundles
of
laths
but
below
in
the
port
his
teeming
supplies
all
the
cooperage
trade
of
anjou
he
knows
to
a
plank
how
many
casks
are
needed
if
the
vintage
is
good
a
hot
season
makes
him
rich
a
rainy
season
ruins
him
in
a
single
morning
puncheons
worth

they
tremble
when

they
should
hear
in
the
morning
of
a
frost
in
the
night
they
dread
rain
wind
drought
and
want

heat
and

to

no

along

being
examined
in
fact
formerly
when
a
stranger
entered
a
provincial
town
he
was
bantered
and
made
game
of
from
door
to
door
from
this
came
many
good
stories
and
the
nickname
which
was
applied
to
the
inhabitants
of
angers
who
excelled
in
such
urban
sarcasms
the
ancient
mansions
of
the
old
town
of
saumur
are
at
the
top
of
this
hilly
street
and
were
formerly
occupied
by
the
nobility
of
the
neighborhood
the
melancholy
dwelling
where
the
events
of
the
following
history
took
place
is
one
of
these
mansions
venerable
relics
of
a
century
in
which
men
and
things
bore
the
characteristics
of
simplicity
which
french
manners
and
customs
are
losing
day
by
day

the
windings
of
the
picturesque
thoroughfare
whose
irregularities
awaken
recollections
that
plunge
the
mind
mechanically
into
reverie
and
you
will
see
a
somewhat
dark
recess
in
the
centre
of
which
is
hidden
the
door
of
the
house
of
monsieur
grandet
it
is
impossible
to
understand
the
force
of
this
provincial
expression
the
house
of
monsieur
grandet
without
giving
the
biography
of
monsieur
grandet
himself
monsieur
grandet
enjoyed
a
reputation
in
saumur
whose
causes
and
effects
can
never
be
fully
understood
by
those
who
have
not
at
one
time
or
another
lived
in
the
provinces
in
monsieur
grandet
still
called
by
certain
persons
le
pere
grandet
though
the
number
of
such
old
persons
has
perceptibly
diminished
was
a
able
to
read
write
and
cipher
at
the
period
when
the
french
republic
offered
for
sale
the
church
property
in
the
arrondissement
of
saumur
the
cooper
then
forty
years
of
age
had
just
married
the
daughter
of
a
rich
supplied
with
the
ready
money
of
his
own
fortune
and
his
wife
s
in
all
about
two
thousand
or
grandet
went
to
the
newly
established
district
where
with
the
help
of
two
hundred
double
louis
given
by
his
to
the
surly
republican
who
presided
over
the
sales
of
the
national
domain
he
obtained
for
a
song
legally
if
not
legitimately
one
of
the
finest
vineyards
in
the
arrondissement
an
old
abbey
and
several
farms
the
inhabitants
of
saumur
were
so
little
revolutionary
that
they
thought
pere
grandet
a
bold
man
a
republican
and
a
patriot
with
a
mind
open
to
all
the
new
ideas
though
in
point
of
fact
it
was
open
only
to
vineyards
he
was
appointed
a
member
of
the
administration
of
saumur
and
his
pacific
influence
made
itself
felt
politically
and
commercially
politically
he
protected
the
nobles
and
prevented
to
the
extent
of
his
power
the
sale
of
the
lands
and
property
of
the
commercially
he
furnished
the
republican
armies
with
two
or
three
thousand
puncheons
of
white
wine
and
took
his
pay
in
splendid
fields
belonging
to
a
community
of
women
whose
lands
had
been
reserved
for
the
last
lot
under
the
consulate
grandet
became
mayor
governed
wisely
and
harvested
still
better
pickings
under
the
empire
he
was
called
monsieur
grandet
napoleon
however
did
not
like
republicans
and
superseded
monsieur
grandet
who
was
supposed
to
have
worn
the
phrygian
cap
by
a
man
of
his
own
surroundings
a
future
baron
of
the
empire
monsieur
grandet
quitted
office
without
regret
he
had
constructed
in
the
interests
of
the
town
certain
fine
roads
which
led
to
his
own
property
his
house
and
lands
very
advantageously
assessed
paid
moderate
taxes
and
since
the
registration
of
his
various
estates
the
vineyards
thanks
to
his
constant
care
had
become
the
head
of
the
country
a
local
term
used
to
denote
those
that
produced
the
finest
quality
of
wine
he
might
have
asked
for
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
this
event
occurred
in
monsieur
grandet
was
then
years
of
age
his
wife
and
an
only
daughter
the
fruit
of
their
legitimate
love
was
ten
years
old
monsieur
grandet
whom
providence
no
doubt
desired
to
compensate
for
the
loss
of
his
municipal
honors
inherited
three
fortunes
in
the
course
of
this
year
that
of
madame
de
la
gaudiniere
born
de
la
bertelliere
the
mother
of
madame
grandet
that
of
old
monsieur
de
la
bertelliere
her
grandfather
and
lastly
that
of
madame
gentillet
her
grandmother
on
the
mother
s
side
three
inheritances
whose
amount
was
not
known
to
any
one
the
avarice
of
the
deceased
persons
was
so
keen
that
for
a
long
time
they
had
hoarded
their
money
for
the
pleasure
of
secretly
looking
at
it
old
monsieur
de
la
bertelliere
called
an
investment
an
extravagance
and
thought
he
got
better
interest
from
the
sight
of
his
gold
than
from
the
profits
of
usury
the
inhabitants
of
saumur
consequently
estimated
his
savings
according
to
the
revenues
of
the
sun
s
wealth
as
they
said
monsieur
grandet
thus
obtained
that
modern
title
of
nobility
which
our
mania
for
equality
can
never
rub
out
he
became
the
most
imposing
personage
in
the
arrondissement
he
worked
a
hundred
acres
of
vineyard
which
in
fruitful
years
yielded
seven
or
eight
hundred
hogsheads
of
wine
he
owned
thirteen
farms
an
old
abbey
whose
windows
and
arches
he
had
walled
up
for
the
sake
of
economy
a
measure
which
preserved
them
also
a
hundred
and
acres
of
where
three
thousand
poplars
planted
in
grew
and
flourished
and
finally
the
house
in
which
he
lived
such
was
his
visible
estate
as
to
his
other
property
only
two
persons
could
give
even
a
vague
guess
at
its
value
one
was
monsieur
cruchot
a
notary
employed
in
the
usurious
investments
of
monsieur
grandet
the
other
was
monsieur
des
grassins
the
richest
banker
in
saumur
in
whose
profits
grandet
had
a
certain
covenanted
and
secret
share
although
old
cruchot
and
monsieur
des
grassins
were
both
gifted
with
the
deep
discretion
which
wealth
and
trust
beget
in
the
provinces
they
publicly
testified
so
much
respect
to
monsieur
grandet
that
observers
estimated
the
amount
of
his
property
by
the
obsequious
attention
which
they
bestowed
upon
him
in
all
saumur
there
was
no
one
not
persuaded
that
monsieur
grandet
had
a
private
treasure
some
full
of
louis
where
he
nightly
took
ineffable
delight
in
gazing
upon
great
masses
of
gold
avaricious
people
gathered
proof
of
this
when
they
looked
at
the
eyes
of
the
good
man
to
which
the
yellow
metal
seemed
to
have
conveyed
its
tints
the
glance
of
a
man
accustomed
to
draw
enormous
interest
from
his
capital
acquires
like
that
of
the
libertine
the
gambler
or
the
sycophant
certain
indefinable
habits
furtive
eager
mysterious
movements
which
never
escape
the
notice
of
his
this
secret
language
is
in
a
certain
way
the
freemasonry
of
the
passions
monsieur
grandet
inspired
the
respectful
esteem
due
to
one
who
owed
no
man
anything
who
skilful
cooper
and
experienced
that
he
was
guessed
with
the
precision
of
an
astronomer
whether
he
ought
to
manufacture
a
thousand
puncheons
for
his
vintage
or
only
five
hundred
who
never
failed
in
any
speculation
and
always
had
casks
for
sale
when
casks
were
worth
more
than
the
commodity
that
filled
them
who
could
store
his
whole
vintage
in
his
cellars
and
bide
his
time
to
put
the
puncheons
on
the
market
at
two
hundred
francs
when
the
little
proprietors
had
been
forced
to
sell
theirs
for
five
louis
his
famous
vintage
of
judiciously
stored
and
slowly
disposed
of
brought
him
in
more
than
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
financially
speaking
monsieur
grandet
was
something
between
a
tiger
and
a
he
could
crouch
and
lie
low
watch
his
prey
a
long
while
spring
upon
it
open
his
jaws
swallow
a
mass
of
louis
and
then
rest
tranquilly
like
a
snake
in
process
of
digestion
impassible
methodical
and
cold
no
one
saw
him
pass
without
a
feeling
of
admiration
mingled
with
respect
and
fear
had
not
every
man
in
saumur
felt
the
rending
of
those
polished
steel
claws
for
this
one
maitre
cruchot
had
procured
the
money
required
for
the
purchase
of
a
domain
but
at
eleven
per
cent
for
that
one
monsieur
des
grassins
discounted
bills
of
exchange
but
at
a
frightful
deduction
of
interest
few
days
ever
passed
that
monsieur
grandet
s
name
was
not
mentioned
either
in
the
markets
or
in
social
conversations
at
the
evening
gatherings
to
some
the
fortune
of
the
old
was
an
object
of
patriotic
pride
more
than
one
merchant
more
than
one
innkeeper
said
to
strangers
with
a
certain
complacency
monsieur
we
have
two
or
three
millionaire
establishments
but
as
for
monsieur
grandet
he
does
not
himself
know
how
much
he
is
in
the
best
reckoners
in
saumur
estimated
the
landed
property
of
the
worthy
man
at
nearly
four
millions
but
as
on
an
average
he
had
made
yearly
from
to
a
hundred
thousand
francs
out
of
that
property
it
was
fair
to
presume
that
he
possessed
in
actual
money
a
sum
nearly
equal
to
the
value
of
his
estate
so
that
when
after
a
game
of
boston
or
an
evening
discussion
on
the
matter
of
vines
the
talk
fell
upon
monsieur
grandet
knowing
people
said
le
pere
grandet
le
pere
grandet
must
have
at
least
five
or
six
you
are
cleverer
than
i
am
i
have
never
been
able
to
find
out
the
amount
answered
monsieur
cruchot
or
monsieur
des
grassins
when
either
chanced
to
overhear
the
remark
if
some
parisian
mentioned
rothschild
or
monsieur
lafitte
the
people
of

asked
if
he
were
as
rich
as
monsieur
grandet
when
the
parisian
with
a
smile
tossed
them
a
disdainful
affirmative
they
looked
at
each

and
shook
their
heads
with
an
incredulous
air
so
large
a
fortune
covered
with
a
golden
mantle
all
the
actions
of
this
man

in

days
some
peculiarities
of
his
life
gave
occasion
for
laughter

laughter

away
his

important
actions
had
the
authority
of
results
repeatedly
shown
his
speech
his
clothing
his
gestures
the
blinking
of

were

every

after
studying
him
as
a
naturalist

monsieur
grandet
s
manners
were
very
simple
he
spoke
little
he
usually
expressed
his
meaning
by
short
sententious
phrases
uttered
in
a
soft
voice
after
the
revolution
the
epoch
at
which
he
first
came
into
notice
the
good
man
stuttered
in
a
wearisome
way
as
soon
as
he
was
required
to
speak
at
length
or
to
maintain
an
argument
this
stammering
the
incoherence
of
his
language
the
flux
of
words
in
which
he
drowned
his
thought
his
apparent
lack
of
logic
attributed
to
defects
of
education
were
in
reality
assumed
and
will
be
sufficiently
explained
by
certain
events
in
the
following
history
four
sentences
precise
as
algebraic
formulas
sufficed
him
usually
to
grasp
and
solve
all
difficulties
of
life
and
commerce

he
never
said
yes
or
no
and
never
committed
himself
to
writing
if
people
talked
to
him
he
listened
coldly
holding
his
chin
in
his
right
hand
and
resting
his
right
elbow
in
the
back
of
his
left
hand
forming
in
his
own
mind
opinions
on
all
matters
from
which
he
never
receded
he
reflected
long
before
making
any
business
agreement
when
his
opponent
after
careful
conversation
avowed
the
secret
of
his
own
purposes
confident
that
he
had
secured
his
listener
s
assent
grandet
answered
i
can
decide
nothing
without
consulting
my
his
wife
whom
he
had
reduced
to
a
state
of
helpless
slavery
was
a
useful
screen
to
him
in
business
he
went
nowhere
among
friends
he
neither
gave
nor
accepted
dinners
he
made
no
stir
or
noise
seeming
to
economize
in
everything
even
movement
he
never
disturbed
or
disarranged
the
things
of
other
people
out
of
respect
for
the
rights
of
property
nevertheless
in
spite
of
his
soft
voice
in
spite
of
his
circumspect
bearing
the
language
and
habits
of
a
coarse
nature
came
to
the
surface
especially
in
his
own
home
where
he
controlled
himself
less
than
elsewhere
physically
grandet
was
a
man
five
feet
high
with
calves
twelve
inches
in
circumference
knotted
and
broad
shoulders
his
face
was
round
tanned
and
pitted
by
the
his
chin
was
straight
his
lips
had
no
curves
his
teeth
were
white
his
eyes
had
that
calm
devouring
expression
which
people
attribute
to
the
basilisk
his
forehead
full
of
transverse
wrinkles
was
not
without
certain
significant
protuberances
his
hair
was
said
to
be
silver
and
gold
by
certain
young
people
who
did
not
realize
the
impropriety
of
making
a
jest
about
monsieur
grandet
his
nose
thick
at
the
end
bore
a
veined
wen
which
the
common
people
said
not
without
reason
was
full
of
malice
the
whole
countenance
showed
a
dangerous
cunning
an
integrity
without
warmth
the
egotism
of
a
man
long
used
to
concentrate
every
feeling
upon
the
enjoyments
of
avarice
and
upon
the
only
human
being
who
was
anything
whatever
to
him
his
daughter
and
sole
heiress
eugenie
attitude
manners
bearing
everything
about
him
in
short
testified
to
that
belief
in
himself
which
the
habit
of
succeeding
in
all
enterprises
never
fails
to
give
to
a
man
thus
though
his
manners
were
unctuous
and
soft
outwardly
monsieur
grandet
s
nature
was
of
iron
his
dress
never
varied
and
those
who
saw
him
saw
him
such
as
he
had
been
since
his
stout
shoes
were
tied
with
leathern
thongs
he
wore
in
all
weathers
thick
woollen
stockings
short
breeches
of
coarse
maroon
cloth
with
silver
buckles
a
velvet
waistcoat
in
alternate
stripes
of
yellow
and
puce
buttoned
squarely
a
large
maroon
coat
with
wide
flaps
a
black
cravat
and
a
quaker
s
hat
his
gloves
thick
as
those
of
a
gendarme
lasted
him
twenty
months
to
preserve
them
he
always
laid
them
methodically
on
the
brim
of
his
hat
in
one
particular
spot
saumur
knew
nothing
further
about
this
personage
only
six
individuals
had
a
right
of
entrance
to
monsieur
grandet
s
house
the
most
important
of
the
first
three
was
a
nephew
of
monsieur
cruchot
since
his
appointment
as
president
of
the
civil
courts
of
saumur
this
young
man
had
added
the
name
of
bonfons
to
that
of
cruchot
he
now
signed
himself
de
bonfons
any
litigant
so
as
to
call
him
monsieur
cruchot
would
soon
be
made
to
feel
his
folly
in
court
the
magistrate
protected
those
who
called
him
monsieur
le
president
but
he
favored
with
gracious
smiles
those
who
addressed
him
as
monsieur
de
bonfons
monsieur
le
president
was
years
old
and
possessed
the
estate
of
bonfons
boni
fontis
worth
seven
thousand
francs
a
year
he
expected
to
inherit
the
property
of
his
uncle
the
notary
and
that
of
another
uncle
the
abbe
cruchot
a
dignitary
of
the
chapter
of
de
tours
both
of
whom
were
thought
to
be
very
rich
these
three
cruchots
backed
by
a
goodly
number
of
cousins
and
allied
to
twenty
families
in
the
town
formed
a
party
like
the
medici
in
florence
like
the
medici
the
cruchots
had
their
pazzi
madame
des
grassins
mother
of
a
son
years
of
age
came
assiduously
to
play
cards
with
madame
grandet
hoping
to
marry
her
dear
adolphe
to
mademoiselle
eugenie
monsieur
des
grassins
the
banker
vigorously
promoted
the
schemes
of
his
wife
by
means
of
secret
services
constantly
rendered
to
the
old
miser
and
always
arrived
in
time
upon
the
field
of
battle
the
three
des
grassins
likewise
had
their
adherents
their
cousins
their
faithful
allies
on
the
cruchot
side
the
abbe
the
talleyrand
of
the
family
well
by
his
brother
the
notary
sharply
contested
every
inch
of
ground
with
his
female
adversary
and
tried
to
obtain
the
rich
heiress
for
his
nephew
the
president
this
secret
warfare
between
the
cruchots
and
des
grassins
the
prize
thereof
being
the
hand
in
marriage
of
eugenie
grandet
kept
the
various
social
circles
of
saumur
in
violent
agitation
would
mademoiselle
grandet
marry
monsieur
le
president
or
monsieur
adolphe
des
grassins
to
this
problem
some
replied
that
monsieur
grandet
would
never
give
his
daughter
to
the
one
or
to
the
other
the
old
cooper
eaten
up
with
ambition
was
looking
they
said
for
a
peer
of
france
to
whom
an
income
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
would
make
all
the
past
present
and
future
casks
of
the
grandets
acceptable
others
replied
that
monsieur
and
madame
des
grassins
were
nobles
and
exceedingly
rich
that
adolphe
was
a
personable
young
fellow
and
that
unless
the
old
man
had
a
nephew
of
the
pope
at
his
beck
and
call
such
a
suitable
alliance
ought
to
satisfy
a
man
who
came
from
nothing
a
man
whom
saumur
remembered
with
an
adze
in
his
hand
and
who
had
moreover
worn
the
certain
wise
heads
called
attention
to
the
fact
that
monsieur
cruchot
de
bonfons
had
the
right
of
entry
to
the
house
at
all
times
whereas
his
rival
was
received
only
on
sundays
others
however
maintained
that
madame
des
grassins
was
more
intimate
with
the
women
of
the
house
of
grandet
than
the
cruchots
were
and
could
put
into
their
minds
certain
ideas
which
would
lead
sooner
or
later
to
success
to
this
the
former
retorted
that
the
abbe
cruchot
was
the
most
insinuating
man
in
the
world
pit
a
woman
against
a
monk
and
the
struggle
was
even
it
is
diamond
cut
diamond
said
a
saumur
wit
the
oldest
inhabitants
wiser
than
their
fellows
declared
that
the
grandets
knew
better
than
to
let
the
property
go
out
of
the
family
and
that
mademoiselle
eugenie
grandet
of
saumur
would
be
married
to
the
son
of
monsieur
grandet
of
paris
a
wealthy
wholesale
to
this
the
cruchotines
and
the
grassinists
replied
in
the
first
place
the
two
brothers
have
seen
each
other
only
twice
in
thirty
years
and
next
monsieur
grandet
of
paris
has
ambitious
designs
for
his
son
he
is
mayor
of
an
arrondissement
a
deputy
colonel
of
the
national
guard
judge
in
the
commercial
courts
he
disowns
the
grandets
of
saumur
and
means
to
ally
himself
with
some
ducal
family
ducal
under
favor
of
in
short
was
there
anything
not
said
of
an
heiress
who
was
talked
of
through
a
circumference
of
fifty
miles
and
even
in
the
public
conveyances
from
angers
to
blois
inclusively
at
the
beginning
of
the
cruchotines
won
a
signal
advantage
over
the
grassinists
the
estate
of
froidfond
remarkable
for
its
park
its
mansion
its
farms
streams
ponds
forests
and
worth
about
three
millions
was
put
up
for
sale
by
the
young
marquis
de
froidfond
who
was
obliged
to
liquidate
his
possessions
maitre
cruchot
the
president
and
the
abbe
aided
by
their
adherents
were
able
to
prevent
the
sale
of
the
estate
in
little
lots
the
notary
concluded
a
bargain
with
the
young
man
for
the
whole
property
payable
in
gold
persuading
him
that
suits
without
number
would
have
to
be
brought
against
the
purchasers
of
small
lots
before
he
could
get
the
money
for
them
it
was
better
therefore
to
sell
the
whole
to
monsieur
grandet
who
was
solvent
and
able
to
pay
for
the
estate
in
ready
money
the
fine
marquisate
of
froidfond
was
accordingly
conveyed
down
the
gullet
of
monsieur
grandet
who
to
the
great
astonishment
of
saumur
paid
for
it
under
proper
discount
with
the
usual
formalities
this
affair
echoed
from
nantes
to
orleans
monsieur
grandet
took
advantage
of
a
cart
returning
by
way
of
froidfond
to
go
and
see
his
chateau
having
cast
a
master
s
eye
over
the
whole
property
he
returned
to
saumur
satisfied
that
he
had
invested
his
money
at
five
per
cent
and
seized
by
the
stupendous
thought
of
extending
and
increasing
the
marquisate
of
froidfond
by
concentrating
all
his
property
there
then
to
fill
up
his
coffers
now
nearly
empty
he
resolved
to
thin
out
his
woods
and
his
forests
and
to
sell
off
the
poplars
in
the
meadows
ii
it
is
now
easy
to
understand
the
full
meaning
of
the
term
the
house
of
monsieur
grandet
that
cold
silent
pallid
dwelling
standing
above
the
town
and
sheltered
by
the
ruins
of
the
ramparts
the
two
pillars
and
the
arch
which
made
the
on
which
the
door
opened
were
built
like
the
house
itself
of
tufa
a
white
stone
peculiar
to
the
shores
of
the
loire
and
so
soft
that
it
lasts
hardly
more
than
two
centuries
numberless
irregular
holes
capriciously
bored
or
eaten
out
by
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
gave
an
appearance
of
the
vermiculated
stonework
of
french
architecture
to
the
arch
and
the
side
walls
of
this
entrance
which
bore
some
resemblance
to
the
gateway
of
a
jail
above
the
arch
was
a
long
in
hard
stone
representing
the
four
seasons
the
faces
already
crumbling
away
and
blackened
this
was
surmounted
by
a
projecting
plinth
upon
which
a
variety
of
chance
growths
had
sprung
up
yellow
pellitory
bindweed
convolvuli
nettles
plantain
and
even
a
little
already
grown
to
some
height
the
door
of
the
archway
was
made
of
solid
oak
brown
shrunken
and
split
in
many
places
though
frail
in
appearance
it
was
firmly
held
in
place
by
a
system
of
iron
bolts
arranged
in
symmetrical
patterns
a
small
square
grating
with
close
bars
red
with
rust
filled
up
the
middle
panel
and
made
as
it
were
a
motive
for
the
knocker
fastened
to
it
by
a
ring
which
struck
upon
the
grinning
head
of
a
huge
nail
this
knocker
of
the
oblong
shape
and
kind
which
our
ancestors
called
looked
like
a
huge
note
of
exclamation
an
antiquary
who
examined
it
attentively
might
have
found
indications
of
the
figure
essentially
burlesque
which
it
once
represented
and
which
long
usage
had
now
effaced
through
this
little
grating
intended
in
olden
times
for
the
recognition
of
friends
in
times
of
civil
war
inquisitive
persons
could
perceive
at
the
farther
end
of
the
dark
and
slimy
vault
a
few
broken
steps
which
led
to
a
garden
picturesquely
shut
in
by
walls
that
were
thick
and
damp
and
through
which
oozed
a
moisture
that
nourished
tufts
of
sickly
herbage
these
walls
were
the
ruins
of
the
ramparts
under
which
ranged
the
gardens
of
several
neighboring
houses
the
most
important
room
on
the
of
the
house
was
a
large
hall
entered
directly
from
beneath
the
vault
of
the
few
people
know
the
importance
of
a
hall
in
the
little
towns
of
anjou
touraine
and
berry
the
hall
is
at
one
and
the
same

antechamber
salon
office
boudoir
and
it
is
the
theatre
of
domestic
life
the
common

the
barber
of
the
neighborhood
came
twice
a
year
to
cut
monsieur
grandet

hair
there

the
miller

came
on

this

with
two
windows
looking
on
the
street
was
entirely
of
wood
gray
panels
with
ancient
mouldings
covered
the
walls
from
top
to
bottom
the
ceiling
showed
all
its
beams
which
were
likewise
painted
gray
while
the
space
between
them
had
been
washed
over
in
white
now
yellow
with
age
an
old
brass
clock
inlaid
with
arabesques
adorned
the
mantel
of
the
white
stone
above
which
was
a
greenish
mirror
whose
edges
bevelled
to
show
the
thickness
of
the

reflected
a
thread
of
light

whole

of

which
was
sufficient
for
ordinary
occasions
the

were
covered
with

was
necessary
however
to
know

at

the
faded
colors
and
the
figures
blurred
by
much
darning
were
difficult
to
distinguish
at
the
four
corners
of
the
hall
were
closets
or
rather
buffets
surmounted
by
dirty
shelves
an
old
in
marquetry
of
which
the
upper
part
was
a
stood
in
the
space
between
the
two
windows
above
this
table
was
an
oval
barometer
with
a
black
border
enlivened
with
gilt
bands
on
which
the
flies
had
so
licentiously
disported
themselves
that
the
gilding
had
become
problematical
on
the
panel
opposite
to
the
were
two
portraits
in
pastel
supposed
to
represent
the
grandfather
of
madame
grandet
old
monsieur
de
la
bertelliere
as
a
lieutenant
in
the
french
guard
and
the
deceased
madame
gentillet
in
the
guise
of
a
shepherdess
the
windows
were
draped
with
curtains
of
red
de
held
back
by
silken
cords
with
ecclesiastical
tassels
this
luxurious
decoration
little
in
keeping
with
the
habits
of
monsieur
grandet
had
been
together
with
the
steel
the
tapestries
and
the
buffets
which
were
of
included
in
the
purchase
of
the
house
by
the
window
nearest
to
the
door
stood
a
straw
chair
whose
legs
were
raised
on
castors
to
lift
its
occupant
madame
grandet
to
a
height
from
which
she
could
see
the
a
of
stained
filled
up
the
embrasure
and
the
little
armchair
of
eugenie
grandet
stood
beside
it
in
this
spot
the
lives
had
flowed
peacefully
onward
for
fifteen
years
in
a
round
of
constant
work
from
the
month
of
april
to
the
month
of
november
on
the
first
day
of
the
latter
month
they
took
their
winter
station
by
the
chimney
not
until
that
day
did
grandet
permit
a
fire
to
be
lighted
and
on
the
of
march
it
was
extinguished
without
regard
either
to
the
chills
of
the
early
spring
or
to
those
of
a
wintry
autumn
a
filled
with
embers
from
the
kitchen
fire
which
la
grande
nanon
contrived
to
save
for
them
enabled
madame
and
mademoiselle
grandet
to
bear
the
chilly
mornings
and
evenings
of
april
and
october
mother
and
daughter
took
charge
of
the
family
linen
and
spent
their
days
so
conscientiously
upon
a
labor
properly
that
of
that
if
eugenie
wished
to
embroider
a
collar
for
her
mother
she
was
forced
to
take
the
time
from
sleep
and
deceive
her
father
to
obtain
the
necessary
light
for
a
long
time
the
miser
had
given
out
the
tallow
candle
to
his
daughter
and
la
grande
nanon
just
as
he
gave
out
every
morning
the
bread
and
other
necessaries
for
the
daily
consumption
la
grande
nanon
was
perhaps
the
only
human
being
capable
of
accepting
willingly
the
despotism
of
her
master
the
whole
town
envied
monsieur
and
madame
grandet
the
possession
of
her
la
grande
nanon
so
called
on
account
of
her
height
which
was
five
feet
eight
inches
had
lived
with
monsieur
grandet
for
years
though
she
received
only
sixty
francs
a
year
in
wages
she
was
supposed
to
be
one
of
the
richest
in
saumur
those
sixty
francs
accumulating
through
years
had
recently
enabled
her
to
invest
four
thousand
francs
in
an
annuity
with
maitre
cruchot
this
result
of
her
long
and
persistent
economy
seemed
gigantic
every
servant
in
the
town
seeing
that
the
poor
sexagenarian
was
sure
of
bread
for
her
old
age
was
jealous
of
her
and
never
thought
of
the
hard
slavery
through
which
it
had
been
won
at
years
of
age
the
poor
girl
had
been
unable
to
find
a
situation
so
repulsive
was
her
face
to
almost
every
one
yet
the
feeling
was
certainly
unjust
the
face
would
have
been
much
admired
on
the
shoulders
of
a
grenadier
of
the
guard
but
all
things
so
they
say
should
be
in
keeping
forced
to
leave
a
farm
where
she
kept
the
cows
because
the
was
burned
down
she
came
to
saumur
to
find
a
place
full
of
the
robust
courage
that
shrinks
from
no
labor
le
pere
grandet
was
at
that
time
thinking
of
marriage
and
about
to
set
up
his
household
he
espied
the
girl
rejected
as
she
was
from
door
to
door
a
good
judge
of
corporeal
strength
in
his
trade
as
a
cooper
he
guessed
the
work
that
might
be
got
out
of
a
female
creature
shaped
like
a
hercules
as
firm
on
her
feet
as
an
oak
sixty
years
old
on
its
roots
strong
in
the
hips
square
in
the
back
with
the
hands
of
a
cartman
and
an
honesty
as
sound
as
her
unblemished
virtue
neither
the
warts
which
adorned
her
martial
visage
nor
the
tints
of
her
skin
nor
the
sinewy
arms
nor
the
ragged
garments
of
la
grande
nanon
dismayed
the
cooper
who
was
at
that
time
still
of
an
age
when
the
heart
shudders
he
fed
shod
and
clothed
the
poor
girl
gave
her
wages
and
put
her
to
work
without
treating
her
too
roughly
seeing
herself
thus
welcomed
la
grande
nanon
wept
secretly
tears
of
joy
and
attached
herself
in
all
sincerity
to
her
master
who
from
that
day
ruled
her
and
worked
her
with
feudal
authority
nanon
did
everything
she
cooked
she
made
the
lye
she
washed
the
linen
in
the
loire
and
brought
it
home
on
her
shoulders
she
got
up
early
she
went
to
bed
late
she
prepared
the
food
of
the
during
the
harvest
kept
watch
upon
the
protected
the
property
of
her
master
like
a
faithful
dog
and
even
full
of
blind
confidence
obeyed
without
a
murmur
his
most
absurd
exactions
in
the
famous
year
of
when
the
grapes
were
gathered
with
difficulty
grandet
resolved
to
give
nanon
his
old
watch
the
first
present
he
had
made
her
during
twenty
years
of
service
though
he
turned
over
to
her
his
old
shoes
which
fitted
her
it
is
impossible
to
consider
that
quarterly
benefit
as
a
gift
for
the
shoes
were
always
thoroughly
necessity
had
made
the
poor
girl
so
niggardly
that
grandet
had
grown
to
love
her
as
we
love
a
dog
and
nanon
had
let
him
fasten
a
spiked
collar
round
her
throat
whose
spikes
no
longer
pricked
her
if
grandet
cut
the
bread
with
rather
too
much
parsimony
she
made
no
complaint
she
gaily
shared
the
hygienic
benefits
derived
from
the
severe
regime
of
the
household
in
which
no
one
was
ever
nanon
was
in
fact
one
of
the
family
she
laughed
when
grandet
laughed
felt
gloomy
or
chilly
warmed
herself
and
toiled
as
he
did
what
pleasant
compensations
there
were
in
such
equality
never
did
the
master
have
occasion
to
find
fault
with
the
servant
for
pilfering
the
grapes
nor
for
the
plums
and
nectarines
eaten
under
the
trees
come
nanon
he
would
say
in
years
when
the
branches
bent
under
the
fruit
and
the
farmers
were
obliged
to
give
it
to
the
pigs
to
the
poor
peasant
who
in
her
youth
had
earned
nothing
but
harsh
treatment
to
the
pauper
girl
picked
up
by
charity
grandet
s
ambiguous
laugh
was
like
a
sunbeam
moreover
nanon
s
simple
heart
and
narrow
head
could
hold
only
one
feeling
and
one
idea
for
years
she
had
never
ceased
to
see
herself
standing
before
the
of
monsieur
grandet
ragged
and
barefooted
and
to
hear
him
say
what
do
you
want
young
one
her
gratitude
was
ever
new
sometimes
grandet
reflecting
that
the
poor
creature
had
never
heard
a
flattering
word
that
she
was
ignorant
of
all
the
tender
sentiments
inspired
by
women
that
she
might
some
day
appear
before
the
throne
of
god
even
more
chaste
than
the
virgin
mary
herself
grandet
struck
with
pity
would
say
as
he
looked
at
her
poor
nanon
the
exclamation
was
always
followed
by
an
undefinable
look
cast
upon
him
in
return
by
the
old
servant
the
words
uttered
from
time
to
time
formed
a
chain
of
friendship
that
nothing
ever
parted
and
to
which
each
exclamation
added
a
link
such
compassion
arising
in
the
heart
of
the
miser
and
accepted
gratefully
by
the
old
spinster
had
something
inconceivably
horrible
about
it
this
cruel
pity
recalling
as
it
did
a
thousand
pleasures
to
the
heart
of
the
old
cooper
was
for
nanon
the
sum
total
of
happiness
who
does
not
likewise
say
poor
nanon
god
will
recognize
his
angels
by
the
inflexions
of
their
voices
and
by
their
secret
sighs
there
were
very
many
households
in
saumur
where
the
servants
were
better
treated
but
where
the
masters
received
far
less
satisfaction
in
return
thus
it
was
often
said
what
have
the
grandets
ever
done
to
make
their
grande
nanon
so
attached
to
them
she
would
go
through
fire
and
water
for
their
sake
her
kitchen
whose
barred
windows
looked
into
the
court
was
always
clean
neat
cold
a
true
miser
s
kitchen
where
nothing
went
to
waste
when
nanon
had
washed
her
dishes
locked
up
the
remains
of
the
dinner
and
put
out
her
fire
she
left
the
kitchen
which
was
separated
by
a
passage
from
the
and
went
to
spin
hemp
beside
her
masters
one
tallow
candle
sufficed
the
family
for
the
evening
the
servant
slept
at
the
end
of
the
passage
in
a
species
of
closet
lighted
only
by
a
her
robust
health
enabled
her
to
live
in
this
hole
with
impunity
there
she
could
hear
the
slightest
noise
through
the
deep
silence
which
reigned
night
and
day
in
that
dreary
house
like
a
she
slept
with
one
ear
open
and
took
her
rest
with
a
mind
alert
a
description
of
the
other
parts
of
the
dwelling
will
be
found
connected
with
the
events
of
this
history
though
the
foregoing
sketch
of
the
hall
where
the
whole
luxury
of
the
household
appears
may
enable
the
reader
to
surmise
the
nakedness
of
the
upper
floors
in
at
the
beginning
of
an
evening
in
the
middle
of
november
la
grande
nanon
lighted
the
fire
for
the
first
time
the
autumn
had
been
very
fine
this
particular
day
was
a
well
known
to
the
cruchotines
and
the
grassinists
the
six
antagonists
armed
at
all
points
were
making
ready
to
meet
at
the
grandets
and
surpass
each
other
in
testimonials
of
friendship
that
morning
all
saumur
had
seen
madame
and
mademoiselle
grandet
accompanied
by
nanon
on
their
way
to
hear
mass
at
the
parish
church
and
every
one
remembered
that
the
day
was
the
anniversary
of
mademoiselle
eugenie
s
birth
calculating
the
hour
at
which
the
family
dinner
would
be
over
maitre
cruchot
the
abbe
cruchot
and
monsieur
de
bonfons
hastened
to
arrive
before
the
des
grassins
and
be
the
first
to
pay
their
compliments
to
mademoiselle
eugenie
all
three
brought
enormous
bouquets
gathered
in
their
little
the
stalks
of
the
flowers
which
the
president
intended
to
present
were
ingeniously
wound
round
with
a
white
satin
ribbon
adorned
with
gold
fringe
in
the
morning
monsieur
grandet
following
his
usual
custom
on
the
days
that
commemorated
the
birth
and
the
fete
of
eugenie
went
to
her
bedside
and
solemnly
presented
her
with
his
paternal
gift
which
for
the
last
thirteen
years
had
consisted
regularly
of
a
curious
madame
grandet
gave
her
daughter
a
winter
dress
or
a
summer
dress
as
the
case
might
be
these
two
dresses
and
the
of
which
she
received
two
others
on
new
year
s
day
and
on
her
father
s
gave
eugenie
a
little
revenue
of
a
hundred
crowns
or
thereabouts
which
grandet
loved
to
see
her
amass
was
it
not
putting
his
money
from
one
to
another
and
as
it
were
training
the
parsimony
of
his
heiress
from
whom
he
sometimes
demanded
an
account
of
her
treasure
formerly
increased
by
the
gifts
of
the
bertellieres
saying
it
is
to
be
your
marriage
the
marriage
dozen
is
an
old
custom
sacredly
preserved
and
still
in
force
in
many
parts
of
central
france
in
berry
and
in
anjou
when
a
young
girl
marries
her
family
or
that
of
the
husband
must
give
her
a
purse
in
which
they
place
according
to
their
means
twelve
pieces
or
twelve

pieces
or
twelve
hundred
pieces
of
gold
the
poorest
never
marries
without
her
dozen
be
it
only
a
dozen
coppers
they
still
tell
in
issoudun
of
a
certain
dozen
presented
to
a
rich
heiress
which
contained
a
hundred

her
when
he
married
her
to

a
dozen

gold
medals
of
priceless
value
during
dinner
the
father
delighted
to
see
his
eugenie
looking
well
in
a
new
gown
exclaimed
as
it
is
eugenie
s
birthday
let
us
have
a
fire
it
will
be
a
good
mademoiselle
will
be
married
this
year
that

said

carrying
away
the
remains
of
the
goose
the
pheasant
of
tradesmen
i
don
t
see
any
one
suitable
for
her
in
saumur
said
madame
grandet
glancing
at
her
husband
with
a
timid
look
which
considering
her
years
revealed
the
conjugal
slavery
under
which
the
poor
woman
languished
grandet
looked
at
his
daughter
and
exclaimed
gaily
she
is
years
old
the
child
we
must
soon
begin
to
think
of
eugenie
and
her
mother
silently
exchanged
a
glance
of
intelligence
madame
grandet
was
a
dry
thin
woman
as
yellow
as
a
quince
awkward
slow
one
of
those
women
who
are
born
to
be
she
had
big
bones
a
big
nose
a
big
forehead
big
eyes
and
presented
at
first
sight
a
vague
resemblance
to
those
mealy
fruits
that
have
neither
savor
nor
succulence
her
teeth
were
black
and
few
in
number
her
mouth
was
wrinkled
her
chin
long
and
pointed
she
was
an
excellent
woman
a
true
la
bertelliere
l
abbe
cruchot
found
occasional
opportunity
to
tell
her
that
she
had
not
done
ill
and
she
believed
him
angelic
sweetness
the
resignation
of
an
insect
tortured
by
children
a
rare
piety
a
good
heart
an
unalterable
equanimity
of
soul
made
her
universally
pitied
and
respected
her
husband
never
gave
her
more
than
six
francs
at
a
time
for
her
personal
expenses
ridiculous
as
it
may
seem
this
woman
who
by
her
own
fortune
and
her
various
inheritances
brought
pere
grandet
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
francs
had
always
felt
so
profoundly
humiliated
by
her
dependence
and
the
slavery
in
which
she
lived
against
which
the
gentleness
of
her
spirit
prevented
her
from
revolting
that
she
had
never
asked
for
one
penny
or
made
a
single
remark
on
the
deeds
which
maitre
cruchot
brought
for
her
signature
this
foolish
secret
pride
this
nobility
of
soul
perpetually
misunderstood
and
wounded
by
grandet
ruled
the
whole
conduct
of
the
wife
madame
grandet
was
attired
habitually
in
a
gown
of
greenish
levantine
silk
endeavoring
to
make
it
last
nearly
a
year
with
it
she
wore
a
large
kerchief
of
white
cotton
cloth
a
bonnet
made
of
plaited
straws
sewn
together
and
almost
always
a
apron
as
she
seldom
left
the
house
she
wore
out
very
few
shoes
she
never
asked
anything
for
herself
grandet
seized
with
occasional
remorse
when
he
remembered
how
long
a
time
had
elapsed
since
he
gave
her
the
last
six
francs
always
stipulated
for
the
wife
s
when
he
sold
his
yearly
vintage
the
four
or
five
louis
presented
by
the
belgian
or
the
dutchman
who
purchased
the
wine
were
the
chief
visible
signs
of
madame
grandet
s
annual
revenues
but
after
she
had
received
the
five
louis
her
husband
would
often
say
to
her
as
though
their
purse
were
held
in
common
can
you
lend
me
a
few
sous
and
the
poor
woman
glad
to
be
able
to
do
something
for
a
man
whom
her
confessor
held
up
to
her
as
her
lord
and
master
returned
him
in
the
course
of
the
winter
several
crowns
out
of
the
when
grandet
drew
from
his
pocket
the
piece
which
he
allowed
monthly
for
the
minor
expenses
thread
needles
and
toilet
of
his
daughter
he
never
failed
to
say
as
he
buttoned
his
breeches
pocket
and
you
mother
do
you
want
anything
my
friend
madame
grandet
would
answer
moved
by
a
sense
of
maternal
dignity
we
will
see
about
that
wasted
dignity
grandet
thought
himself
very
generous
to
his
wife
philosophers
who
meet
the
like
of
nanon
of
madame
grandet
of
eugenie
have
surely
a
right
to
say
that
irony
is
at
the
bottom
of
the
ways
of
providence
after
the
dinner
at
which
for
the
first
time
allusion
had
been
made
to
eugenie
s
marriage
nanon
went
to
fetch
a
bottle
of
ratafia
from
monsieur
grandet
s
and
nearly
fell
as
she
came
down
the
stairs
you
great
stupid
said
her
master
are
you
going
to
tumble
about
like
other
people
hey
monsieur
it
was
that
step
on
your
staircase
which
has
given
she
is
right
said
madame
grandet
it
ought
to
have
been
mended
long
ago
yesterday
eugenie
nearly
twisted
her
here
said
grandet
to
nanon
seeing
that
she
looked
quite
pale
as
it
is
eugenie
s
birthday
and
you
came
near
falling
take
a
little
glass
of
ratafia
to
set
you
faith
i
ve
earned
it
said
nanon
most
people
would
have
broken
the
bottle
but
i
d
sooner
have
broken
my
elbow
holding
it
up
poor
nanon
said
grandet
filling
a
glass
did
you
hurt
yourself
asked
eugenie
looking
kindly
at
her
no
i
didn
t
fall
i
threw
myself
back
on
my
well
as
it
is
eugenie
s
birthday
said
grandet
i
ll
have
the
step
mended
you
people
don
t
know
how
to
set
your
foot
in
the
corner
where
the
wood
is
still
grandet
took
the
candle
leaving
his
wife
daughter
and
servant
without
any
other
light
than
that
from
the
hearth
where
the
flames
were
lively
and
went
into
the
bakehouse
to
fetch
planks
nails
and
tools
can
i
help
you
cried
nanon
hearing
him
hammer
on
the
stairs
no
no
i
m
an
old
hand
at
it
answered
the
former
cooper
at
the
moment
when
grandet
was
mending
his
staircase
and
whistling
with
all
his
might
in
remembrance
of
the
days
of
his
youth
the
three
cruchots
knocked
at
the
door
is
it
you
monsieur
cruchot
asked
nanon
peeping
through
the
little
grating
yes
answered
the
president
nanon
opened
the
door
and
the
light
from
the
hearth
reflected
on
the
ceiling
enabled
the
three
cruchots
to
find
their
way
into
the
room
ha
you
ve
come
said
nanon
smelling
the
flowers
excuse
me
messieurs
cried
grandet
recognizing
their
voices
i
ll
be
with
you
in
a
moment
i
m
not
proud
i
am
patching
up
a
step
on
my
go
on
go
on
monsieur
grandet
a
man
s
house
is
his
castle
said
the
president
sententiously
madame
and
mademoiselle
grandet
rose
the
president
profiting
by
the
darkness
said
to
eugenie
will
you
permit
me
mademoiselle
to
wish
you
on
this
the
day
of
your
birth
a
series
of
happy
years
and
the
continuance
of
the
health
which
you
now
enjoy
he
offered
her
a
huge
bouquet
of
choice
flowers
which
were
rare
in
saumur
then
taking
the
heiress
by
the
elbows
he
kissed
her
on
each
side
of
her
neck
with
a
complacency
that
made
her
blush
the
president
who
looked
like
a
rusty
iron
nail
felt
that
his
courtship
was
progressing
don
t
stand
on
ceremony
said
grandet
entering
how
well
you
do
things
on
monsieur
le
president
when
it
concerns
mademoiselle
said
the
abbe
armed
with
his
own
bouquet
every
day
is
a
for
my
the
abbe
kissed
eugenie
s
hand
as
for
maitre
cruchot
he
boldly
kissed
her
on
both
cheeks
remarking
how
we
sprout
up
to
be
sure
every
year
is
twelve
as
he
replaced
the
candlestick
beside
the
clock
grandet
who
never
forgot
his
own
jokes
and
repeated
them
to
satiety
when
he
thought
them
funny
said
as
this
is
eugenie
s
birthday
let
us
he
carefully
took
off
the
branches
of
the
candelabra
put
a
socket
on
each
pedestal
took
from
nanon
a
new
tallow
candle
with
paper
twisted
round
the
end
of
it
put
it
into
the
hollow
made
it
firm
lit
it
and
then
sat
down
beside
his
wife
looking
alternately
at
his
friends
his
daughter
and
the
two
candles
the
abbe
cruchot
a
plump
puffy
little
man
with
a
red
wig
plastered
down
and
a
face
like
an
old
female
gambler
said
as
he
stretched
out
his
feet
well
shod
in
stout
shoes
with
silver
buckles
the
des
grassins
have
not
come
not
yet
said
grandet
but
are
they
coming
asked
the
old
notary
twisting
his
face
which
had
as
many
holes
as
a
collander
into
a
queer
grimace
i
think
so
answered
madame
grandet
are
your
vintages
all
finished
said
monsieur
de
bonfons
to
grandet
yes
all
of
them
said
the
old
man
rising
to
walk
up
and
down
the
room
his
chest
swelling
with
pride
as
he
said
the
words
all
of
through
the
door
of
the
passage
which
led
to
the
kitchen
he
saw
la
grande
nanon
sitting
beside
her
fire
with
a
candle
and
preparing
to
spin
there
so
as
not
to
intrude
among
the
guests
nanon
he
said
going
into
the
passage
put
out
that
fire
and
that
candle
and
come
and
sit
with
us
pardieu
the
hall
is
big
enough
for
but
monsieur
you
are
to
have
the
great
are
not
you
as
good
as
they
they
are
descended
from
adam
and
so
are
grandet
came
back
to
the
president
and
said
have
you
sold
your
vintage
no
not
i
i
shall
keep
it
if
the
wine
is
good
this
year
it
will
be
better
two
years
hence
the
proprietors
you
know
have
made
an
agreement
to
keep
up
the
price
and
this
year
the
belgians
won
t
get
the
better
of
us
suppose
they
are
sent
off
for
once
faith
they
ll
come
yes
but
let
us
mind
what
we
are
about
said
grandet
in
a
tone
which
made
the
president
tremble
is
he
driving
some
bargain
thought
cruchot
at
this
moment
the
knocker
announced
the
des
grassins
family
and
their
arrival
interrupted
a
conversation
which
had
begun
between
madame
grandet
and
the
abbe
madame
des
grassins
was
one
of
those
lively
plump
little
women
with
skins
who
thanks
to
the
claustral
calm
of
the
provinces
and
the
habits
of
a
virtuous
life
keep
their
youth
until
they
are
past
forty
she
was
like
the
last
rose
of
autumn
pleasant
to
the
eye
though
the
petals
have
a
certain
frostiness
and
their
perfume
is
slight
she
dressed
well
got
her
fashions
from
paris
set
the
tone
to
saumur
and
gave
parties
her
husband
formerly
a
quartermaster
in
the
imperial
guard
who
had
been
desperately
wounded
at
austerlitz
and
had
since
retired
still
retained
in
spite
of
his
respect
for
grandet
the
seeming
frankness
of
an
old
soldier
good
evening
grandet
he
said
holding
out
his
hand
and
affecting
a
sort
of
superiority
with
which
he
always
crushed
the
cruchots
mademoiselle
he
added
turning
to
eugenie
after
bowing
to
madame
grandet
you
are
always
beautiful
and
good
and
truly
i
do
not
know
what
to
wish
so
saying
he
offered
her
a
little
box
which
his
servant
had
brought
and
which
contained
a
cape
heather
a
flower
lately
imported
into
europe
and
very
rare
madame
des
grassins
kissed
eugenie
very
affectionately
pressed
her
hand
and
said
adolphe
wishes
to
make
you
my
little
a
tall
blond
young
man
pale
and
slight
with
tolerable
manners
and
seemingly
rather
shy
although
he
had
just
spent
eight
or
ten
thousand
francs
over
his
allowance
in
paris
where
he
had
been
sent
to
study
law
now
came
forward
and
kissed
eugenie
on
both
cheeks
offering
her
a
workbox
with
utensils
in
mere
trumpery
in
spite
of
the
monogram
in
gothic
letters
rather
well
engraved
which
belonged
properly
to
something
in
better
taste
as
she
opened
it
eugenie
experienced
one
of
those
unexpected
and
perfect
delights
which
make
a
young
girl
blush
and
quiver
and
tremble
with
pleasure
she
turned
her
eyes
to
her
father
as
if
to
ask
permission
to
accept
it
and
monsieur
grandet
replied
take
it
my
daughter
in
a
tone
which
would
have
made
an
actor
illustrious
the
three
cruchots
felt
crushed
as
they
saw
the
joyous
animated
look
cast
upon
adolphe
des
grassins
by
the
heiress
to
whom
such
riches
were
monsieur
des
grassins
offered
grandet
a
pinch
of
snuff
took
one
himself
shook
off
the
grains
as
they
fell
on
the
ribbon
of
the
legion
of
honor
which
was
attached
to
the
of
his
blue
surtout
then
he
looked
at
the
cruchots
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
say
parry
that
thrust
if
you
can
madame
des
grassins
cast
her
eyes
on
the
blue
vases
which
held
the
cruchot
bouquets
looking
at
the
enemy
s
gifts
with
the
pretended
interest
of
a
satirical
woman
at
this
delicate
juncture
the
abbe
cruchot
left
the
company
seated
in
a
circle
round
the
fire
and
joined
grandet
at
the
lower
end
of
the
hall
as
the
two
men
reached
the
embrasure
of
the
farthest
window
the
priest
said
in
the
miser
s
ear
those
people
throw
money
out
of
the
what
does
that
matter
if
it
gets
into
my
cellar
retorted
the
old
if
you
want
to
give
gilt
scissors
to
your
daughter
you
have
the
means
said
the
abbe
i
give
her
something
better
than
scissors
answered
grandet
my
nephew
is
a
blockhead
thought
the
abbe
as
he
looked
at
the
president
whose
rumpled
hair
added
to
the
ill
grace
of
his
brown
countenance
couldn
t
he
have
found
some
little
trifle
which
cost
money
we
will
join
you
at
cards
madame
grandet
said
madame
des
grassins
we
might
have
two
tables
as
we
are
all
as
it
is
eugenie
s
birthday
you
had
better
play
loto
all
together
said
pere
grandet
the
two
young
ones
can
join
and
the
old
cooper
who
never
played
any
game
motioned
to
his
daughter
and
adolphe
come
nanon
set
the
we
will
help
you
mademoiselle
nanon
said
madame
des
grassins
gaily
quite
joyous
at
the
joy
she
had
given
eugenie
i
have
never
in
my
life
been
so
pleased
the
heiress
said
to
her
i
have
never
seen
anything
so
adolphe
brought
it
from
paris
and
he
chose
it
madame
des
grassins
whispered
in
her
ear
go
on
go
on
damned
intriguing
thing
thought
the
president
if
you
ever
have
a
suit
in
court
you
or
your
husband
it
shall
go
hard
with
the
notary
sitting
in
his
corner
looked
calmly
at
the
abbe
saying
to
himself
the
des
grassins
may
do
what
they
like
my
property
and
my
brother
s
and
that
of
my
nephew
amount
in
all
to
eleven
hundred
thousand
francs
the
des
grassins
at
the
most
have
not
half
that
besides
they
have
a
daughter
they
may
give
what
presents
they
like
heiress
and
presents
too
will
be
ours
one
of
these
at
eight
in
the
evening
the
two
were
set
out
madame
des
grassins
succeeded
in
putting
her
son
beside
eugenie
the
actors
in
this
scene
so
full
of
interest
commonplace
as
it
seems
were
provided
with
bits
of
pasteboard
striped
in
many
colors
and
numbered
and
with
counters
of
blue
glass
and
they
appeared
to
be
listening
to
the
jokes
of
the
notary
who
never
drew
a
number
without
making
a
remark
while
in
fact
they
were
all
thinking
of
monsieur
grandet
s
millions
the
old
cooper
with
inward
was
contemplating
the
pink
feathers
and
the
fresh
toilet
of
madame
des
grassins
the
martial
head
of
the
banker
the
faces
of
adolphe
the
president
the
abbe
and
the
notary
saying
to
himself
they
are
all
after
my
money
hey
neither
the
one
nor
the
other
shall
have
my
daughter
but
they
are
useful
useful
as
harpoons
to
fish
this
family
gaiety
in
the
old
gray
room
dimly
lighted
by
two
tallow
candles
this
laughter
accompanied
by
the
whirr
of
nanon
s
sincere
only
upon
the
lips
of
eugenie
or
her
mother
this
triviality
mingled
with
important
interests
this
young
girl
who
like
certain
birds
made
victims
of
the
price
put
upon
them
was
now
lured
and
trapped
by
proofs
of
friendship
of
which
she
was
the
dupe
all
these
things
contributed
to
make
the
scene
a
melancholy
comedy
is
it
not
moreover
a
drama
of
all
times
and
all
places
though
here
brought
down
to
its
simplest
expression
the
figure
of
grandet
playing
his
own
game
with
the
false
friendship
of
the
two
families
and
getting
enormous
profits
from
it
dominates
the
scene
and
throws
light
upon
it
the
modern
god
the
only
god
in
whom
faith
is
preserved
money
is
here
in
all
its
power
manifested
in
a
single
countenance
the
tender
sentiments
of
life
hold
here
but
a
secondary
place
only
the
three
pure
simple
hearts
of
nanon
of
eugenie
and
of
her
mother
were
inspired
by
them
and
how
much
of
ignorance
there
was
in
the
simplicity
of
these
poor
women
eugenie
and
her
mother
knew
nothing
of
grandet
s
wealth
they
could
only
estimate
the
things
of
life
by
the
glimmer
of
their
pale
ideas
and
they
neither
valued
nor
despised
money
because
they
were
accustomed
to
do
without
it
their
feelings
bruised
though
they
did
not
know
it
but
were
the
secret
spring
of
their
existence
and
made
them
curious
exceptions
in
the
midst
of
these
other
people
whose
lives
were
purely
material
frightful
condition
of
the
human
race
there
is
no
one
of
its
joys
that
does
not
come
from
some
species
of
ignorance
at
the
moment
when
madame
grandet
had
won
a
loto
of
sixteen
sous
the
largest
ever
pooled
in
that
house
and
while
la
grande
nanon
was
laughing
with
delight
as
she
watched
madame
pocketing
her
riches
the
knocker
resounded
on
the
with
such
a
noise
that
the
women
all
jumped
in
their
chairs
there
is
no
man
in
saumur
who
would
knock
like
that
said
the
notary
how
can
they
bang
in
that
way
exclaimed
nanon
do
they
want
to
break
in
the
door
who
the
devil
is
it
cried
grandet
iii
nanon
took
one
of
the
candles
and
went
to
open
the
door
followed
by
her
master
grandet
grandet
cried
his
wife
moved
by
a
sudden
impulse
of
fear
and
running
to
the
door
of
the
room
all
the
players
looked
at
each
other
suppose
we
all
go
said
monsieur
des
grassins
that
knock
strikes
me
as
hardly
was
monsieur
des
grassins
allowed
to
see
the
figure
of
a
young
man
accompanied
by
a
porter
from
the
carrying
two
large
trunks
and
dragging
a
after
him
than
monsieur
grandet
turned
roughly
on
his
wife
and
said
madame
grandet
go
back
to
your
loto
leave
me
to
speak
with
then
he
pulled
the
door
quickly
to
and
the
excited
players
returned
to
their
seats
but
did
not
continue
the
game
is
it
any
one
belonging
to
saumur
monsieur
des
grassins
asked
his
wife
no
it
is
a
he
must
have
come
from
just
so
said
the
notary
pulling
out
his
watch
which
was
two
inches
thick
and
looked
like
a
dutch
it
s
nine
o
clock
the
diligence
of
the
grand
bureau
is
never
is
the
gentleman
young
inquired
the
abbe
cruchot
yes
answered
monsieur
des
grassins
and
he
has
brought
luggage
which
must
weigh
nearly
three
nanon
does
not
come
back
said
eugenie
it
must
be
one
of
your
relations
remarked
the
president
let
us
go
on
with
our
game
said
madame
grandet
gently
i
know
from
monsieur
grandet
s
tone
of
voice
that
he
is
annoyed
perhaps
he
would
not
like
to
find
us
talking
of
his
mademoiselle
said
adolphe
to
his
neighbor
it
is
no
doubt
your
cousin
grandet
a
very
young
man
i
met
him
at
the
ball
of
monsieur
de
adolphe
did
not
go
on
for
his
mother
trod
on
his
toes
and
then
asking
him
aloud
for
two
sous
to
put
on
her
stake
she
whispered
will
you
hold
your
tongue
you
great
goose
at
this
moment
grandet
returned
without
la
grande
nanon
whose
steps
together
with
those
of
the
porter
echoed
up
the
staircase
and
he
was
followed
by
the
traveller
who
had
excited
such
curiosity
and
so
filled
the
lively
imaginations
of
those
present
that
his
arrival
at
this
dwelling
and
his
sudden
fall
into
the
midst
of
this
assembly
can
only
be
likened
to
that
of
a
snail
into
a
beehive
or
the
introduction
of
a
peacock
into
some
village
sit
down
near
the
fire
said
grandet
before
seating
himself
the
young
stranger
saluted
the
assembled
company
very
gracefully
the
men
rose
to
answer
by
a
courteous
inclination
and
the
women
made
a
ceremonious
bow
you
are
cold
no
doubt
monsieur
said
madame
grandet
you
have
perhaps
travelled
from
just
like
all
women
said
the
old
looking
up
from
a
letter
he
was
reading
do
let
monsieur
rest
himself
but
father
perhaps
monsieur
would
like
to
take
something
said
eugenie
he
has
got
a
tongue
said
the
old
man
sternly
the
stranger
was
the
only
person
surprised
by
this
scene
all
the
others
were
to
the
despotic
ways
of
the
master
however
after
the
two
questions
and
the
two
replies
had
been
exchanged
the
newcomer
rose
turned
his
back
towards
the
fire
lifted
one
foot
so
as
to
warm
the
sole
of
its
boot
and
said
to
eugenie
thank
you
my
cousin
but
i
dined
at
tours
and
he
added
looking
at
grandet
i
need
nothing
i
am
not
even
monsieur
has
come
from
the
capital
asked
madame
des
grassins
monsieur
charles
such
was
the
name
of
the
son
of
monsieur
grandet
of
paris
hearing
himself
addressed
took
a
little
suspended
by
a
chain
from
his
neck
applied
it
to
his
right
eye
to
examine
what
was
on
the
table
and
also
the
persons
sitting
round
it
he
ogled
madame
des
grassins
with
much
impertinence
and
said
to
her
after
he
had
observed
all
he
wished
yes
madame
you
are
playing
at
loto
aunt
he
added
do
not
let
me
interrupt
you
i
beg
go
on
with
your
game
it
is
too
amusing
to
i
was
certain
it
was
the
cousin
thought
madame
des
grassins
casting
repeated
glances
at
him
cried
the
old
abbe
mark
it
down
madame
des
grassins
isn
t
that
your
number
monsieur
des
grassins
put
a
counter
on
his
wife
s
card
who
sat
watching
first
the
cousin
from
paris
and
then
eugenie
without
thinking
of
her
loto
a
prey
to
mournful
presentiments
from
time
to
time
the
young
heiress
glanced
furtively
at
her
cousin
and
the
banker
s
wife
easily
detected
a
of
surprise
and
curiosity
in
her
mind
monsieur
charles
grandet
a
handsome
young
man
of
presented
at
this
moment
a
singular
contrast
to
the
worthy
provincials
who
considerably
disgusted
by
his
aristocratic
manners
were
all
studying
him
with
sarcastic
intent
this
needs
an
explanation
at
young
people
are
still
so
near
childhood
that
they
often
conduct
themselves
childishly
in
all
probability
out
of
every
hundred
of
them
fully
would
have
behaved
precisely
as
monsieur
charles
grandet
was
now
behaving
some
days
earlier
than
this
his
father
had
told
him
to
go
and
spend
several
months
with
his
uncle
at
saumur
perhaps
monsieur
grandet
was
thinking
of
eugenie
charles
sent
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
into
the
provinces
took
a
fancy
to
make
his
appearance
with
the
superiority
of
a
man
of
fashion
to
reduce
the
whole
arrondissement
to
despair
by
his
luxury
and
to
make
his
visit
an
epoch
importing
into
those
country
regions
all
the
refinements
of
parisian
life
in
short
to
explain
it
in
one
word
he
mean
to
pass
more
time
at
saumur
in
brushing
his
nails
than
he
ever
thought
of
doing
in
paris
and
to
assume
the
extra
nicety
and
elegance
of
dress
which
a
young
man
of
fashion
often
lays
aside
for
a
certain
negligence
which
in
itself
is
not
devoid
of
grace
charles
therefore
brought
with
him
a
complete
the
finest
gun
the
best
in
the
prettiest
sheath
to
be
found
in
all
paris
he
brought
his
whole
collection
of
waistcoats
they
were
of
all
kinds
gray
black
white
some
were
shot
with
gold
some
spangled
some
some
were
and
crossed
like
a
shawl
others
were
straight
in
the
collar
some
had
collars
some
buttoned
up
to
the
top
with
gilt
buttons
he
brought
every
variety
of
collar
and
cravat
in
fashion
at
that
epoch
he
brought
two
of
buisson
s
coats
and
all
his
finest
linen
he
brought
his
pretty
gold
a
present
from
his
mother
he
brought
all
his
dandy
not
forgetting
a
ravishing
little
desk
presented
to
him
by
the
most
amiable
of
women
amiable
for
him
at
least
a
fine
lady
whom
he
called
annette
and
who
at
this
moment
was
travelling
matrimonially
and
wearily
in
scotland
a
victim
to
certain
suspicions
which
required
a
passing
sacrifice
of
happiness
in
the
desk
was
much
pretty
on
which
to
write
to
her
once
a
fortnight
in
short
it
was
as
complete
a
cargo
of
parisian
frivolities
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
get
together
a
collection
of
all
the
implements
of
husbandry
with
which
the
youth
of
leisure
tills
his
life
from
the
little
whip
which
helps
to
begin
a
duel
to
the
handsomely
chased
pistols
which
end
it
his
father
having
told
him
to
travel
alone
and
modestly
he
had
taken
the
coupe
of
the
diligence
all
to
himself
rather
pleased
at
not
having
to
damage
a
delightful
ordered
for
a
journey
on
which
he
was
to
meet
his
annette
the
great
lady
who
whom
he
intended
to
rejoin
at
baden
in
the
following
june
charles
expected
to
meet
scores
of
people
at
his
uncle
s
house
to
hunt
in
his
uncle
s
forests
to
live
in
short
the
usual
chateau
life
he
did
not
know
that
his
uncle
was
in
saumur
and
had
only
inquired
about
him
incidentally
when
asking
the
way
to
froidfond
hearing
that
he
was
in
town
he
supposed
that
he
should
find
him
in
a
suitable
mansion
in
order
that
he
might
make
a
becoming
first
appearance
before
his
uncle
either
at
saumur
or
at
froidfond
he
had
put
on
his
most
elegant
travelling
attire
simple
yet
exquisite
adorable
to
use
the
word
which
in
those
days
summed
up
the
special
perfections
of
a
man
or
a
thing
at
tours
a
hairdresser
had
his
beautiful
chestnut
locks
there
he
changed
his
linen
and
put
on
a
black
satin
cravat
which
combined
with
a
round
framed
his
fair
and
smiling
countenance
agreeably
a
travelling
only
half
buttoned
up
nipped
in
his
waist
and
disclosed
a
cashmere
waistcoat
crossed
in
front
beneath
which
was
another
waistcoat
of
white
material
his
watch
negligently
slipped
into
a
pocket
was
fastened
by
a
short
gold
chain
to
a
buttonhole
his
gray
trousers
buttoned
up
at
the
sides
were
set
off
at
the
seams
with
patterns
of
black
silk
embroidery
he
gracefully
twirled
a
cane
whose
chased
gold
knob
did
not
mar
the
freshness
of
his
gray
gloves
and
to
complete
all
his
cap
was
in
excellent
taste
none
but
a
parisian
and
a
parisian
of
the
upper
spheres
could
thus
array
himself
without
appearing
ridiculous
none
other
could
give
the
harmony
of
to
all
these
fopperies
which
were
carried
off
however
with
a
dashing
air
the
air
of
a
young
man
who
has
fine
pistols
a
sure
aim
and
annette
now
if
you
wish
to
understand
the
mutual
amazement
of
the
provincial
party
and
the
young
parisian
if
you
would
clearly
see
the
brilliance
which
the
traveller
s
elegance
cast
among
the
gray
shadows
of
the
room
and
upon
the
faces
of
this
family
group
endeavor
to
picture
to
your
minds
the
cruchots
all
three
took
snuff
and
had
long
ceased
to
repress
the
habit
of
snivelling
or
to
remove
the
brown
blotches
which
strewed
the
frills
of
their
dingy
shirts
and
the
yellowing
creases
of
their
crumpled
collars
their
flabby
cravats
were
twisted
into
ropes
as
soon
as
they
wound
them
about
their
throats
the
enormous
quantity
of
linen
which
allowed
these
people
to
have
their
clothing
washed
only
once
in
six
months
and
to
keep
it
during
that
time
in
the
depths
of
their
closets
also
enabled
time
to
lay
its
grimy
and
decaying
stains
upon
it
there
was
perfect
unison
of
and
senility
about
them
their
faces
as
faded
as
their
threadbare
coats
as
creased
as
their
trousers
were
and
puckered
as
for
the
others
the
general
negligence
of
their
dress
which
was
incomplete
and
wanting
in
freshness
like
the
toilet
of
all
country
places
where
insensibly
people
cease
to
dress
for
others
and
come
to
think
seriously
of
the
price
of
a
pair
of
gloves
was
in
keeping
with
the
negligence
of
the
cruchots
a
horror
of
fashion
was
the
only
point
on
which
the
grassinists
and
the
cruchotines
agreed
when
the
parisian
took
up
his
to
examine
the
strange
accessories
of
this
dwelling
the
joists
of
the
ceiling
the
color
of
the
woodwork
and
the
specks
which
the
flies
had
left
there
in
sufficient
number
to
punctuate
the
moniteur
and
the
encyclopaedia
of
sciences
the
lifted
their
noses
and
looked
at
him
with
as
much
curiosity
as
they
might
have
felt
about
a
giraffe
monsieur
des
grassins
and
his
son
to
whom
the
appearance
of
a
man
of
fashion
was
not
wholly
unknown
were
nevertheless
as
much
astonished
as
their
neighbors
whether
it
was
that
they
fell
under
the
indefinable
influence
of
the
general
feeling
or
that
they
really
shared
it
as
with
satirical
glances
they
seemed
to
say
to
their
compatriots
that
is
what
you
see
in
paris
they
were
able
to
examine
charles
at
their
leisure
without
fearing
to
displease
the
master
of
the
house
grandet
was
absorbed
in
the
long
letter
which
he
held
in
his
hand
and
to
read
it
he
had
taken
the
only
candle
upon
the
paying
no
heed
to
his
guests
or
their
pleasure
eugenie
to
whom
such
a
type
of
perfection
whether
of
dress
or
of
person
was
absolutely
unknown
thought
she
beheld
in
her
cousin
a
being
descended
from
seraphic
spheres
she
inhaled
with
delight
the
fragrance
wafted
from
the
graceful
curls
of
that
brilliant
head
she
would
have
liked
to
touch
the
soft
kid
of
the
delicate
gloves
she
envied
charles
his
small
hands
his
complexion
the
freshness
and
refinement
of
his
features
in
short
if
it
is
possible
to
sum
up
the
effect
this
elegant
being
produced
upon
an
ignorant
young
girl
perpetually
employed
in
darning
stockings
or
in
mending
her
father
s
clothes
and
whose
life
flowed
on
beneath
these
unclean
rafters
seeing
none
but
occasional
passers
along
the
silent
street
this
vision
of
her
cousin
roused
in
her
soul
an
emotion
of
delicate
desire
like
that
inspired
in
a
young
man
by
the
fanciful
pictures
of
women
drawn
by
westall
for
the
english
keepsakes
and
that
engraved
by
the
findens
with
so
clever
a
tool
that
we
fear
as
we
breathe
upon
the
paper
that
the
celestial
apparitions
may
be
wafted
away
charles
drew
from
his
pocket
a
handkerchief
embroidered
by
the
great
lady
now
travelling
in
scotland
as
eugenie
saw
this
pretty
piece
of
work
done
in
the
vacant
hours
which
were
lost
to
love
she
looked
at
her
cousin
to
see
if
it
were
possible
that
he
meant
to
make
use
of
it
the
manners
of
the
young
man
his
gestures
the
way
in
which
he
took
up
his
his
affected
superciliousness
his
contemptuous
glance
at
the
coffer
which
had
just
given
so
much
pleasure
to
the
rich
heiress
and
which
he
evidently
regarded
as
without
value
or
even
as
ridiculous
all
these
things
which
shocked
the
cruchots
and
the
des
grassins
pleased
eugenie
so
deeply
that
before
she
slept
she
dreamed
long
dreams
of
her
phoenix
cousin
the
were
drawn
very
slowly
and
presently
the
game
came
suddenly
to
an
end
la
grand
nanon
entered
and
said
aloud
madame
i
want
the
sheets
for
monsieur
s
madame
grandet
followed
her
out
madame
des
grassins
said
in
a
low
voice
let
us
keep
our
sous
and
stop
each
took
his
or
her
two
sous
from
the
chipped
saucer
in
which
they
had
been
put
then
the
party
moved
in
a
body
toward
the
fire
have
you
finished
your
game
said
grandet
without
looking
up
from
his
letter
yes
yes
replied
madame
des
grassins
taking
a
seat
near
charles
eugenie
prompted
by
a
thought
often
born
in
the
heart
of
a
young
girl
when
sentiment
enters
it
for
the
first
time
left
the
room
to
go
and
help
her
mother
and
nanon
had
an
able
confessor
then
questioned
her
she
would
no
doubt
have
avowed
to
him
that
she
thought
neither
of
her
mother
nor
of
nanon
but
was
pricked
by
a
poignant
desire
to
look
after
her
cousin
s
room
and
concern
herself
with
her
cousin
to
supply
what
might
be
needed
to
remedy
any
forgetfulness
to
see
that
all
was
done
to
make
it
as
far
as
possible
suitable
and
elegant
and
in
fact
she
arrived
in
time
to
prove
to
her
mother
and
nanon
that
everything
still
remained
to
be
done
she
put
into
nanon
s
head
the
notion
of
passing
a
between
the
sheets
she
herself
covered
the
old
table
with
a
cloth
and
requested
nanon
to
change
it
every
morning
she
convinced
her
mother
that
it
was
necessary
to
light
a
good
fire
and
persuaded
nanon
to
bring
up
a
great
pile
of
wood
into
the
corridor
without
saying
anything
to
her
father
she
ran
to
get
from
one
of
the
of
the
hall
a
tray
of
old
lacquer
which
was
part
of
the
inheritance
of
the
late
monsieur
de
la
bertelliere
catching
up
at
the
same
time
a
crystal
goblet
a
little
tarnished
gilt
spoon
an
antique
flask
engraved
with
cupids
all
of
which
she
put
triumphantly
on
the
corner
of
her
cousin
s
more
ideas
surged
through
her
head
in
one
quarter
of
an
hour
than
she
had
ever
had
since
she
came
into
the
world
mamma
she
said
my
cousin
will
never
bear
the
smell
of
a
tallow
candle
suppose
we
buy
a
wax
one
and
she
darted
swift
as
a
bird
to
get
the
piece
which
she
had
just
received
for
her
monthly
expenses
here
nanon
she
cried
quick
what
will
your
father
say
this
terrible
remonstrance
was
uttered
by
madame
grandet
as
she
beheld
her
daughter
armed
with
an
old
sevres
which
grandet
had
brought
home
from
the
chateau
of
froidfond
and
where
will
you
get
the
sugar
are
you
crazy
mamma
nanon
can
buy
some
sugar
as
well
as
the
but
your
father
surely
his
nephew
ought
not
to
go
without
a
glass
of
besides
he
will
not
notice
your
father
sees
everything
said
madame
grandet
shaking
her
head
nanon
hesitated
she
knew
her
master
come
nanon
go
because
it
is
my
nanon
gave
a
loud
laugh
as
she
heard
the
first
little
jest
her
young
mistress
had
ever
made
and
then
obeyed
her
while
eugenie
and
her
mother
were
trying
to
embellish
the
bedroom
assigned
by
monsieur
grandet
for
his
nephew
charles
himself
was
the
object
of
madame
des
grassins
attentions
to
all
appearances
she
was
setting
her
cap
at
him
you
are
very
courageous
monsieur
she
said
to
the
young
dandy
to
leave
the
pleasures
of
the
capital
at
this
season
and
take
up
your
abode
in
saumur
but
if
we
do
not
frighten
you
away
you
will
find
there
are
some
amusements
even
she
threw
him
the
ogling
glance
of
the
provinces
where
women
put
so
much
prudence
and
reserve
into
their
eyes
that
they
impart
to
them
the
prudish
concupiscence
peculiar
to
certain
ecclesiastics
to
whom
all
pleasure
is
either
a
theft
or
an
error
charles
was
so
completely
out
of
his
element
in
this
abode
and
so
far
from
the
vast
chateau
and
the
sumptuous
life
with
which
his
fancy
had
endowed
his
uncle
that
as
he
looked
at
madame
des
grassins
he
perceived
a
dim
likeness
to
parisian
faces
he
gracefully
responded
to
the
species
of
invitation
addressed
to
him
and
began
very
naturally
a
conversation
in
which
madame
des
grassins
gradually
lowered
her
voice
so
as
to
bring
it
into
harmony
with
the
nature
of
the
confidences
she
was
making
with
her
as
with
charles
there
was
the
need
of
conference
so
after
a
few
moments
spent
in
coquettish
phrases
and
a
little
serious
jesting
the
clever
provincial
said
thinking
herself
unheard
by
the
others
who
were
discussing
the
sale
of
wines
which
at
that
season
filled
the
heads
of
every
one
in
saumur
monsieur
if
you
will
do
us
the
honor
to
come
and
see
us
you
will
give
as
much
pleasure
to
my
husband
as
to
myself
our
salon
is
the
only
one
in
saumur
where
you
will
find
the
higher
business
circles
mingling
with
the
nobility
we
belong
to
both
societies
who
meet
at
our
house
simply
because
they
find
it
amusing
my
husband
i
say
it
with
pride
is
as
much
valued
by
the
one
class
as
by
the
other
we
will
try
to
relieve
the
monotony
of
your
visit
here
if
you
stay
all
the
time
with
monsieur
grandet
good
heavens
what
will
become
of
you
your
uncle
is
a
sordid
miser
who
thinks
of
nothing
but
his
vines
your
aunt
is
a
pious
soul
who
can
t
put
two
ideas
together
and
your
cousin
is
a
little
fool
without
education
perfectly
common
no
fortune
who
will
spend
her
life
in
darning
she
is
really
very
nice
this
woman
thought
charles
grandet
as
he
duly
responded
to
madame
des
grassins
coquetries
it
seems
to
me
wife
that
you
are
taking
possession
of
monsieur
said
the
stout
banker
laughing
on
this
remark
the
notary
and
the
president
said
a
few
words
that
were
more
or
less
significant
but
the
abbe
looking
at
them
slyly
brought
their
thoughts
to
a
focus
by
taking
a
pinch
of
snuff
and
saying
as
he
handed
round
his
who
can
do
the
honors
of
saumur
for
monsieur
so
well
as
madame
ah
what
do
you
mean
by
that
monsieur
l
abbe
demanded
monsieur
des
grassins
i
mean
it
in
the
best
possible
sense
for
you
for
madame
for
the
town
of
saumur
and
for
monsieur
said
the
wily
old
man
turning
to
charles
the
abbe
cruchot
had
guessed
the
conversation
between
charles
and
madame
des
grassins
without
seeming
to
pay
attention
to
it
monsieur
said
adolphe
to
charles
with
an
air
which
he
tried
to
make
free
and
easy
i
don
t
know
whether
you
remember
me
but
i
had
the
honor
of
dancing
as
your
at
a
ball
given
by
the
baron
de
nucingen
and
perfectly
i
remember
perfectly
monsieur
answered
charles
pleased
to
find
himself
the
object
of
general
attention
monsieur
is
your
son
he
said
to
madame
des
grassins
the
abbe
looked
at
her
maliciously
yes
monsieur
she
answered
then
you
were
very
young
when
you
were
in
paris
said
charles
addressing
adolphe
you
must
know
monsieur
said
the
abbe
that
we
send
them
to
babylon
as
soon
as
they
are
madame
des
grassins
examined
the
abbe
with
a
glance
of
extreme
penetration
it
is
only
in
the
provinces
he
continued
that
you
will
find
women
of
thirty
and
more
years
as
fresh
as
madame
here
with
a
son
about
to
take
his
degree
i
almost
fancy
myself
back
in
the
days
when
the
young
men
stood
on
chairs
in
the
to
see
you
dance
madame
said
the
abbe
turning
to
his
female
adversary
to
me
your
triumphs
are
but
of
yesterday
the
old
rogue
thought
madame
grassins
can
he
have
guessed
my
intentions
it
seems
that
i
shall
have
a
good
deal
of
success
in
saumur
thought
charles
as
he
unbuttoned
his
put
a
hand
into
his
waistcoat
and
cast
a
glance
into
the
far
distance
to
imitate
the
attitude
which
chantrey
has
given
to
lord
byron
the
inattention
of
pere
grandet
or
to
speak
more
truly
the
preoccupation
of
mind
into
which
the
reading
of
the
letter
had
plunged
him
did
not
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
notary
and
the
president
who
tried
to
guess
the
contents
of
the
letter
by
the
almost
imperceptible
motions
of
the
miser
s
face
which
was
then
under
the
full
light
of
the
candle
he
maintained
the
habitual
calm
of
his
features
with
evident
difficulty
we
may
in
fact
picture
to
ourselves
the
countenance
such
a
man
endeavored
to
preserve
as
he
read
the
fatal
letter
which
here
follows
my
brother
it
is
almost
years
since
we
have
seen
each
other
my
marriage
was
the
occasion
of
our
last
interview
after
which
we
parted
and
both
of
us
were
happy
assuredly
i
could
not
then
foresee
that
you
would
one
day
be
the
prop
of
the
family
whose
prosperity
you
then
predicted
when
you
hold
this
letter
within
your
hands
i
shall
be
no
longer
living
in
the
position
i
now
hold
i
can
not
survive
the
disgrace
of
bankruptcy
i
have
waited
on
the
edge
of
the
gulf
until
the
last
moment
hoping
to
save
myself
the
end
has
come
i
must
sink
into
it
the
double
bankruptcies
of
my
broker
and
of
roguin
my
notary
have
carried
off
my
last
resources
and
left
me
nothing
i
have
the
bitterness
of
owing
nearly
four
millions
with
assets
not
more
than
per
cent
in
value
to
pay
them
the
wines
in
my
warehouses
suffer
from
the
fall
in
prices
caused
by
the
abundance
and
quality
of
your
vintage
in
three
days
paris
will
cry
out
monsieur
grandet
was
a
knave
and
i
an
honest
man
shall
be
lying
in
my
of
infamy
i
deprive
my
son
of
a
good
name
which
i
have
stained
and
the
fortune
of
his
mother
which
i
have
lost
he
knows
nothing
of
all
this
my
unfortunate
child
whom
i
idolize
we
parted
tenderly
he
was
ignorant
happily
that
the
last
beatings
of
my
heart
were
spent
in
that
farewell
will
he
not
some
day
curse
me
my
brother
my
brother
the
curses
of
our
children
are
horrible
they
can
appeal
against
ours
but
theirs
are
irrevocable
grandet
you
are
my
elder
brother
you
owe
me
your
protection
act
for
me
so
that
charles
may
cast
no
bitter
words
upon
my
grave
my
brother
if
i
were
writing
with
my
blood
with
my
tears
no
greater
anguish
could
i
put
into
this
letter
nor
as
great
for
then
i
should
weep
i
should
bleed
i
should
die
i
should
suffer
no
more
but
now
i
suffer
and
look
at
death
with
dry
eyes
from
henceforth
you
are
my
son
s
father
he
has
no
relations
as
you
well
know
on
his
mother
s
side
why
did
i
not
consider
social
prejudices
why
did
i
yield
to
love
why
did
i
marry
the
natural
daughter
of
a
great
lord
charles
has
no
family
oh
my
unhappy
son
my
son
listen
grandet
i
implore
nothing
for
myself
besides
your
property
may
not
be
large
enough
to
carry
a
mortgage
of
three
millions
but
for
my
son
brother
my
suppliant
hands
are
clasped
as
i
think
of
you
behold
them
grandet
i
confide
my
son
to
you
in
dying
and
i
look
at
the
means
of
death
with
less
pain
as
i
think
that
you
will
be
to
him
a
father
he
loved
me
well
my
charles
i
was
good
to
him
i
never
thwarted
him
he
will
not
curse
me
ah
you
see
he
is
gentle
he
is
like
his
mother
he
will
cause
you
no
grief
poor
boy
accustomed
to
all
the
enjoyments
of
luxury
he
knows
nothing
of
the
privations
to
which
you
and
i
were
condemned
by
the
poverty
of
our
youth
and
i
leave
him
ruined
alone
yes
all
my
friends
will
avoid
him
and
it
is
i
who
have
brought
this
humiliation
upon
him
would
that
i
had
the
force
to
send
him
with
one
thrust
into
the
heavens
to
his
mother
s
side
madness
i
come
back
to
my
disaster
to
his
i
send
him
to
you
that
you
may
tell
him
in
some
fitting
way
of
my
death
of
his
future
fate
be
a
father
to
him
but
a
good
father
do
not
tear
him
all
at
once
from
his
idle
life
it
would
kill
him
i
beg
him
on
my
knees
to
renounce
all
rights
that
as
his
mother
s
heir
he
may
have
on
my
estate
but
the
prayer
is
superfluous
he
is
honorable
and
he
will
feel
that
he
must
not
appear
among
my
creditors
bring
him
to
see
this
at
the
right
time
reveal
to
him
the
hard
conditions
of
the
life
i
have
made
for
him
and
if
he
still
has
tender
thoughts
of
me
tell
him
in
my
name
that
all
is
not
lost
for
him
yes
work
labor
which
saved
us
both
may
give
him
back
the
fortune
of
which
i
have
deprived
him
and
if
he
listens
to
his
father
s
voice
as
it
reaches
him
from
the
grave
he
will
go
the
indies
my
brother
charles
is
an
upright
and
courageous
young
man
give
him
the
wherewithal
to
make
his
venture
he
will
die
sooner
than
not
repay
you
the
funds
which
you
may
lend
him
grandet
if
you
will
not
do
this
you
will
lay
up
for
yourself
remorse
ah
should
my
child
find
neither
tenderness
nor
succor
in
you
i
would
call
down
the
vengeance
of
god
upon
your
cruelty
if
i
had
been
able
to
save
something
from
the
wreck
i
might
have
had
the
right
to
leave
him
at
least
a
portion
of
his
mother
s
property
but
my
last
monthly
payments
have
absorbed
everything
i
did
not
wish
to
die
uncertain
of
my
child
s
fate
i
hoped
to
feel
a
sacred
promise
in
a
clasp
of
your
hand
which
might
have
warmed
my
heart
but
time
fails
me
while
charles
is
journeying
to
you
i
shall
be
preparing
my
assignment
i
shall
endeavor
to
show
by
the
order
and
good
faith
of
my
accounts
that
my
disaster
comes
neither
from
a
faulty
life
nor
from
dishonesty
it
is
for
my
son
s
sake
that
i
strive
to
do
this
farewell
my
brother
may
the
blessing
of
god
be
yours
for
the
generous
guardianship
i
lay
upon
you
and
which
i
doubt
not
you
will
accept
a
voice
will
henceforth
and
forever
pray
for
you
in
that
world
where
we
must
all
go
and
where
i
am
now
as
you
read
these
lines
grandet
so
you
are
talking
said
pere
grandet
as
he
carefully
folded
the
letter
in
its
original
creases
and
put
it
into
his
he
looked
at
his
nephew
with
a
humble
timid
air
beneath
which
he
hid
his
feelings
and
his
calculations
have
you
warmed
yourself
he
said
to
him
thoroughly
my
dear
well
where
are
the
women
said
his
uncle
already
forgetting
that
his
nephew
was
to
sleep
at
the
house
at
this
moment
eugenie
and
madame
grandet
returned
is
the
room
all
ready
said
grandet
recovering
his
composure
yes
well
then
my
nephew
if
you
are
tired
nanon
shall
show
you
your
room
it
isn
t
a
dandy
s
room
but
you
will
excuse
a
poor
who
never
has
a
penny
to
spare
taxes
swallow
up
we
do
not
wish
to
intrude
grandet
said
the
banker
you
may
want
to
talk
to
your
nephew
and
therefore
we
will
bid
you
at
these
words
the
assembly
rose
and
each
made
a
parting
bow
in
keeping
with
his
or
her
own
character
the
old
notary
went
to
the
door
to
fetch
his
lantern
and
came
back
to
light
it
offering
to
accompany
the
des
grassins
on
their
way
madame
des
grassins
had
not
foreseen
the
incident
which
brought
the
evening
prematurely
to
an
end
her
servant
therefore
had
not
arrived
will
you
do
me
the
honor
to
take
my
arm
madame
said
the
abbe
thank
you
monsieur
l
abbe
but
i
have
my
son
she
answered
dryly
ladies
can
not
compromise
themselves
with
me
said
the
abbe
take
monsieur
cruchot
s
arm
said
her
husband
the
abbe
walked
off
with
the
pretty
lady
so
quickly
that
they
were
soon
some
distance
in
advance
of
the
caravan
that
is
a
young
man
madame
he
said
pressing
her
arm
to
the
grapes
the
vintage
is
done
it
is
all
over
with
us
we
may
as
well
say
adieu
to
mademoiselle
grandet
eugenie
will
belong
to
the
dandy
unless
this
cousin
is
enamoured
of
some
parisian
woman
your
son
adolphe
will
find
another
rival
in
not
at
all
monsieur
l
abbe
this
young
man
can
not
fail
to
see
that
eugenie
is
a
little
fool
a
girl
without
the
least
freshness
did
you
notice
her
she
was
as
yellow
as
a
perhaps
you
made
the
cousin
notice
it
i
did
not
take
the
trouble
place
yourself
always
beside
eugenie
madame
and
you
need
never
take
the
trouble
to
say
anything
to
the
young
man
against
his
cousin
he
will
make
his
own
comparisons
which
well
he
has
promised
to
dine
with
me
the
day
after
ah
if
you
only
madame
said
the
abbe
what
is
it
that
you
wish
me
to
do
monsieur
l
abbe
do
you
mean
to
offer
me
bad
advice
i
have
not
reached
the
age
of
without
a
stain
upon
my
reputation
thank
god
to
compromise
myself
now
even
for
the
empire
of
the
great
mogul
you
and
i
are
of
an
age
when
we
both
know
the
meaning
of
words
for
an
ecclesiastic
you
certainly
have
ideas
that
are
very
incongruous
fie
it
is
worthy
of
faublas
you
have
read
faublas
no
monsieur
l
abbe
i
meant
to
say
the
ah
that
book
is
infinitely
more
moral
said
the
abbe
laughing
but
you
make
me
out
as
wicked
as
a
young
man
of
the
present
day
i
only
meant
do
you
dare
to
tell
me
you
were
not
thinking
of
putting
wicked
things
into
my
head
isn
t
it
perfectly
clear
if
this
young
man
who
i
admit
is
very
were
to
make
love
to
me
he
would
not
think
of
his
cousin
in
paris
i
know
good
mothers
do
devote
themselves
in
this
way
to
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
their
children
but
we
live
in
the
provinces
monsieur
l
yes
and
she
continued
i
do
not
want
and
adolphe
himself
would
not
want
a
hundred
millions
brought
at
such
a
madame
i
said
nothing
about
a
hundred
millions
that
temptation
might
be
too
great
for
either
of
us
to
withstand
only
i
do
think
that
an
honest
woman
may
permit
herself
in
all
honor
certain
harmless
little
coquetries
which
are
in
fact
part
of
her
social
duty
and
which
do
you
think
so
are
we
not
bound
madame
to
make
ourselves
agreeable
to
each
other
permit
me
to
blow
my
i
assure
you
madame
he
resumed
that
the
young
gentleman
ogled
you
through
his
glass
in
a
more
flattering
manner
than
he
put
on
when
he
looked
at
me
but
i
forgive
him
for
doing
homage
to
beauty
in
preference
to
old
age
it
is
quite
apparent
said
the
president
in
his
loud
voice
that
monsieur
grandet
of
paris
has
sent
his
son
to
saumur
with
extremely
matrimonial
but
in
that
case
the
cousin
wouldn
t
have
fallen
among
us
like
a
answered
the
notary
that
doesn
t
prove
anything
said
monsieur
des
grassins
the
old
miser
is
always
making
des
grassins
my
friend
i
have
invited
the
young
man
to
dinner
you
must
go
and
ask
monsieur
and
madame
de
larsonniere
and
the
du
hautoys
with
the
beautiful
demoiselle
du
hautoy
of
course
i
hope
she
will
be
properly
dressed
that
jealous
mother
of
hers
does
make
such
a
fright
of
her
gentlemen
i
trust
that
you
will
all
do
us
the
honor
to
come
she
added
stopping
the
procession
to
address
the
two
cruchots
here
you
are
at
home
madame
said
the
notary
after
bowing
to
the
three
des
grassins
the
three
cruchots
returned
home
applying
their
provincial
genius
for
analysis
to
studying
under
all
its
aspects
the
great
event
of
the
evening
which
undoubtedly
changed
the
respective
positions
of
grassinists
and
cruchotines
the
admirable
which
guided
all
the
actions
of
these
great
machinators
made
each
side
feel
the
necessity
of
a
momentary
alliance
against
a
common
enemy
must
they
not
mutually
hinder
eugenie
from
loving
her
cousin
and
the
cousin
from
thinking
of
eugenie
could
the
parisian
resist
the
influence
of
treacherous
insinuations
calumnies
slanders
full
of
faint
praise
and
artless
denials
which
should
be
made
to
circle
incessantly
about
him
and
deceive
him
iv
when
the
four
relations
were
left
alone
monsieur
grandet
said
to
his
nephew
we
must
go
to
bed
it
is
too
late
to
talk
about
the
matters
which
have
brought
you
here
we
will
take
a
suitable
moment
we
breakfast
at
eight
o
clock
at
midday
we
eat
a
little
fruit
or
a
bit
of
bread
and
drink
a
glass
of
white
wine
and
we
dine
like
the
parisians
at
five
o
clock
that
s
the
order
of
the
day
if
you
like
to
go
and
see
the
town
and
the
environs
you
are
free
to
do
so
you
will
excuse
me
if
my
occupations
do
not
permit
me
to
accompany
you
you
may
perhaps
hear
people
say
that
i
am
rich
monsieur
grandet
this
monsieur
grandet
that
i
let
them
talk
their
gossip
does
not
hurt
my
credit
but
i
have
not
a
penny
i
work
in
my
old
age
like
an
apprentice
whose
worldly
goods
are
a
bad
plane
and
two
good
arms
perhaps
you
ll
soon
know
yourself
what
a
franc
costs
when
you
have
got
to
sweat
for
it
nanon
where
are
the
candles
i
trust
my
nephew
that
you
will
find
all
you
want
said
madame
grandet
but
if
you
should
need
anything
else
you
can
call
my
dear
aunt
i
shall
need
nothing
i
have
i
believe
brought
everything
with
me
permit
me
to
bid
you
and
my
young
cousin
charles
took
a
lighted
wax
candle
from
nanon
s
hand
an
anjou
candle
very
yellow
in
color
and
so
shopworn
that
it
looked
like
tallow
and
deceived
monsieur
grandet
who
incapable
of
suspecting
its
presence
under
his
roof
did
not
perceive
this
magnificence
i
will
show
you
the
way
he
said
instead
of
leaving
the
hall
by
the
door
which
opened
under
the
archway
grandet
ceremoniously
went
through
the
passage
which
divided
the
hall
from
the
kitchen
a
furnished
with
a
large
oval
pane
of
glass
shut
this
passage
from
the
staircase
so
as
to
fend
off
the
cold
air
which
rushed
through
it
but
the
north
wind
whistled
none
the
less
keenly
in
winter
and
in
spite
of
the
at
the
bottom
of
the
doors
of
the
the
temperature
within
could
scarcely
be
kept
at
a
proper
height
nanon
went
to
bolt
the
outer
door
then
she
closed
the
hall
and
let
loose
a
whose
bark
was
so
strangled
that
he
seemed
to
have
laryngitis
this
animal
noted
for
his
ferocity
recognized
no
one
but
nanon
the
two
untutored
children
of
the
fields
understood
each
other
when
charles
saw
the
yellow
walls
of
the
well
of
the
staircase
where
each
step
shook
under
the
heavy
of
his
uncle
his
expectations
began
to
sober
more
and
more
he
fancied
himself
in
a
his
aunt
and
cousin
to
whom
he
turned
an
inquiring
look
were
so
used
to
the
staircase
that
they
did
not
guess
the
cause
of
his
amazement
and
took
the
glance
for
an
expression
of
friendliness
which
they
answered
by
a
smile
that
made
him
desperate
why
the
devil
did
my
father
send
me
to
such
a
place
he
said
to
himself
when
they
reached
the
first
landing
he
saw
three
doors
painted
in
etruscan
red
and
without
casings
doors
sunk
in
the
dusty
walls
and
provided
with
iron
bars
which
in
fact
were
bolts
each
ending
with
the
pattern
of
a
flame
as
did
both
ends
of
the
long
sheath
of
the
lock
the
first
door
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
which
opened
into
a
room
directly
above
the
kitchen
was
evidently
walled
up
in
fact
the
only
entrance
to
that
room
was
through
grandet
s
bedchamber
the
room
itself
was
his
office
the
single
window
which
lighted
it
on
the
side
of
the
court
was
protected
by
a
lattice
of
strong
iron
bars
no
one
not
even
madame
grandet
had
permission
to
enter
it
the
old
man
chose
to
be
alone
like
an
alchemist
in
his
laboratory
there
no
doubt
some
had
been
ingeniously
constructed
there
the
of
property
were
stored
there
hung
the
scales
on
which
to
weigh
the
louis
there
were
devised
by
night
and
secretly
the
estimates
the
profits
the
receipts
so
that
business
men
finding
grandet
prepared
at
all
points
imagined
that
he
got
his
cue
from
fairies
or
demons
there
no
doubt
while
nanon
s
loud
snoring
shook
the
rafters
while
the
watched
and
yawned
in
the
courtyard
while
madame
and
mademoiselle
grandet
were
quietly
sleeping
came
the
old
cooper
to
cuddle
to
con
over
to
caress
and
clutch
and
clasp
his
gold
the
walls
were
thick
the
screens
sure
he
alone
had
the
key
of
this
laboratory
where
so
people
declared
he
studied
the
maps
on
which
his
were
marked
and
calculated
his
profits
to
a
vine
and
almost
to
a
twig
the
door
of
eugenie
s
chamber
was
opposite
to
the
entrance
to
this
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
landing
were
the
appartements
of
the
married
pair
which
occupied
the
whole
front
of
the
house
madame
grandet
had
a
room
next
to
that
of
eugenie
which
was
entered
through
a
glass
door
the
master
s
chamber
was
separated
from
that
of
his
wife
by
a
partition
and
from
the
mysterious
by
a
thick
wall
pere
grandet
lodged
his
nephew
on
the
second
floor
in
the
high
mansarde
attic
which
was
above
his
own
bedroom
so
that
he
might
hear
him
if
the
young
man
took
it
into
his
head
to
go
and
come
when
eugenie
and
her
mother
reached
the
middle
of
the
landing
they
kissed
each
other
for
then
with
a
few
words
of
adieu
to
charles
cold
upon
the
lips
but
certainly
very
warm
in
the
heart
of
the
young
girl
they
withdrew
into
their
own
chambers
here
you
are
in
your
room
my
nephew
said
pere
grandet
as
he
opened
the
door
if
you
need
to
go
out
call
nanon
without
her
beware
the
dog
would
eat
you
up
without
a
word
sleep
well
ha
why
they
have
made
you
a
fire
he
cried
at
this
moment
nanon
appeared
with
the
warming
pan
here
s
something
more
said
monsieur
grandet
do
you
take
my
nephew
for
a
woman
carry
off
your
brazier
nanon
but
monsieur
the
sheets
are
damp
and
this
gentleman
is
as
delicate
as
a
well
go
on
as
you
ve
taken
it
into
your
head
said
grandet
pushing
her
by
the
shoulders
but
don
t
set
things
on
so
saying
the
miser
went
grumbling
indistinct
sentences
charles
stood
aghast
in
the
midst
of
his
trunks
after
casting
his
eyes
on
the
covered
with
that
yellow
paper
sprinkled
with
bouquets
so
well
known
in
on
the
fireplace
of
ribbed
stone
whose
very
look
was
chilling
on
the
chairs
of
yellow
wood
with
varnished
cane
seats
that
seemed
to
have
more
than
the
usual
four
angles
on
the
open
capacious
enough
to
hold
a
small
on
the
meagre
bit
of
beside
the
bed
on
the
tester
whose
cloth
valance
shook
as
if
devoured
by
moths
it
was
about
to
fall
he
turned
gravely
to
la
grande
nanon
and
said
look
here

dear
woman

tell
me

the
house
of

mayor
of
saumur

go
in
the
water
here

me
my
out
of
that
valise
there
s
the
nanon
was
by
the
sight
of
a
made
of
green
silk
brocaded
with
gold
flowers
of
an
antique
design
are
you
going
to
put
that
on
to
go
to
bed
with
she
asked
holy
virgin
what
a
beautiful
it

parish

church

too
good
a
christian
not
to
give
it
to
you
when
i
go
away
and
you
can
do
what
you
like
with
nanon
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
gazing
at
charles
and
unable
to
put
faith
into
his
words
good
night
what
in
the
world
have
i
come
here
for
thought
charles
as
he
went
to
sleep
my
father
is
not
a
fool
my
journey
must
have
some
object
pshaw
put
off
serious
thought
till
the
morrow
as
some
greek
idiot
blessed
virgin
how
charming
he
is
my
cousin
eugenie
was
saying
interrupting
her
prayers
which
that
night
at
least
were
never
finished
madame
grandet
had
no
thoughts
at
all
as
she
went
to
bed
she
heard
the
miser
walking
up
and
down
his
room
through
the
door
of
communication
which
was
in
the
middle
of
the
partition
like
all
timid
women
she
had
studied
the
character
of
her
lord
just
as
the
petrel
foresees
the
storm
she
knew
by
imperceptible
signs
when
an
inward
tempest
shook
her
husband
and
at
such
times
to
use
an
expression
of
her
own
she
feigned
grandet
gazed
at
the
door
lined
with
which
he
lately
put
to
his
sanctum
and
said
to
himself
what
a
crazy
idea
of
my
brother
to
bequeath
his
son
to
me
a
fine
legacy
i
have
not
fifty
francs
to
give
him
what
are
fifty
francs
to
a
dandy
who
looked
at
my
barometer
as
if
he
meant
to
make
firewood
of
it
in
thinking
over
the
consequences
of
that
legacy
of
anguish
grandet
was
perhaps
more
agitated
than
his
brother
had
been
at
the
moment
of
writing
it
i
shall
have
that
golden
robe
thought
nanon
who
went
to
sleep
tricked
out
in
her
dreaming
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
of
flowers
embroidery
and
damask
just
as
eugenie
was
dreaming
of
love
in
the
pure
and
monotonous
life
of
young
girls
there
comes
a
delicious
hour
when
the
sun
sheds
its
rays
into
their
soul
when
the
flowers
express
their
thoughts
when
the
throbbings
of
the
heart
send
upward
to
the
brain
their
fertilizing
warmth
and
melt
all
thoughts
into
a
vague
desire
day
of
innocent
melancholy
and
of
dulcet
joys
when
babes
begin
to
see
they
smile
when
a
young
girl
first
perceives
the
sentiment
of
nature
she
smiles
as
she
smiled
when
an
infant
if
light
is
the
first
love
of
life
is
not
love
a
light
to
the
heart
the
moment
to
see
within
the
veil
of
earthly
things
had
come
for
eugenie
an
early
riser
like
all
provincial
girls
she
was
up
betimes
and
said
her
prayers
and
then
began
the
business
of
dressing
a
business
which
henceforth
was
to
have
a
meaning
first
she
brushed
and
smoothed
her
chestnut
hair
and
twisted
its
heavy
masses
to
the
top
of
her
head
with
the
utmost
care
preventing
the
loose
tresses
from
straying
and
giving
to
her
head
a
symmetry
which
heightened
the
timid
candor
of
her
face
for
the
simplicity
of
these
accessories
accorded
well
with
the
innocent
sincerity
of
its
lines
as
she
washed
her
hands
again
and
again
in
the
cold
water
which
hardened
and
reddened
the
skin
she
looked
at
her
handsome
round
arms
and
asked
herself
what
her
cousin
did
to
make
his
hands
so
softly
white
his
nails
so
delicately
curved
she
put
on
new
stockings
and
her
prettiest
shoes
she
laced
her
corset
straight
without
skipping
a
single
eyelet
and
then
wishing
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
to
appear
to
advantage
she
felt
the
joy
of
having
a
new
gown
well
made
which
rendered
her
attractive
as
she
finished
her
toilet
the
clock
of
the
parish
church
struck
the
hour
to
her
astonishment
it
was
only
seven
the
desire
of
having
plenty
of
time
for
dressing
carefully
had
led
her
to
get
up
too
early
ignorant
of
the
art
of
retouching
every
curl
and
studying
every
effect
eugenie
simply
crossed
her
arms
sat
down
by
the
window
and
looked
at
the
the
narrow
garden
and
the
high
terraced
walls
that
it
a
dismal
prospect
yet
not
wholly
devoid
of
those
mysterious
beauties
which
belong
to
solitary
or
uncultivated
nature
near
the
kitchen
was
a
well
surrounded
by
a
curb
with
a
pulley
fastened
to
a
bent
iron
rod
clasped
by
a
vine
whose
leaves
were
withered
reddened
and
shrivelled
by
the
season
from
thence
the
tortuous
shoots
straggled
to
the
wall
clutched
it
and
ran
the
whole
length
of
the
house
ending
near
the
where
the
logs
were
ranged
with
as
much
precision
as
the
books
in
a
library
the
pavement
of
the
showed
the
black
stains
produced
in
time
by
lichens
herbage
and
the
absence
of
all
movement
or
friction
the
thick
walls
wore
a
coating
of
green
moss
streaked
with
waving
brown
lines
and
the
eight
stone
steps
at
the
bottom
of
the
which
led
up
to
the
gate
of
the
garden
were
disjointed
and
hidden
beneath
tall
plants
like
the
tomb
of
a
knight
buried
by
his
widow
in
the
days
of
the
crusades
above
a
foundation
of
crumbling
stones
was
a
trellis
of
rotten
wood
half
fallen
from
decay
over
them
clambered
and
intertwined
at
will
a
mass
of
clustering
creepers
on
each
side
of
the
latticed
gate
stretched
the
crooked
arms
of
two
stunted
three
parallel
walks
gravelled
and
separated
from
each
other
by
square
beds
where
the
earth
was
held
in
by
made
the
garden
which
terminated
beneath
a
terrace
of
the
old
walls
in
a
group
of
lindens
at
the
farther
end
were
at
the
other
near
the
house
an
immense
drooped
its
branches
almost
into
the
window
of
the
miser
s
sanctum
a
clear
day
and
the
beautiful
autumnal
sun
common
to
the
banks
of
the
loire
was
beginning
to
melt
the
which
the
night
had
laid
on
these
picturesque
objects
on
the
walls
and
on
the
plants
which
swathed
the
eugenie
found
a
novel
charm
in
the
aspect
of
things
lately
so
insignificant
to
her
a
thousand
confused
thoughts
came
to
birth
in
her
mind
and
grew
there
as
the
sunbeams
grew
without
along
the
wall
she
felt
that
impulse
of
delight
vague
inexplicable
which
wraps
the
moral
being
as
a
cloud
wraps
the
physical
body
her
thoughts
were
all
in
keeping
with
the
details
of
this
strange
landscape
and
the
harmonies
of
her
heart
blended
with
the
harmonies
of
nature
when
the
sun
reached
an
angle
of
the
wall
where
the
of
southern
climes
drooped
its
thick
leaves
lit
with
the
changing
colors
of
a
pigeon
s
breast
celestial
rays
of
hope
illumined
the
future
to
her
eyes
and
thenceforth
she
loved
to
gaze
upon
that
piece
of
wall
on
its
pale
flowers
its
blue
harebells
its
wilting
herbage
with
which
she
mingled
memories
as
tender
as
those
of
childhood
the
noise
made
by
each
leaf
as
it
fell
from
its
twig
in
the
void
of
that
echoing
court
gave
answer
to
the
secret
questionings
of
the
young
girl
who
could
have
stayed
there
the
livelong
day
without
perceiving
the
flight
of
time
then
came
tumultuous
heavings
of
the
soul
she
rose
often
went
to
her
glass
and
looked
at
herself
as
an
author
in
good
faith
looks
at
his
work
to
criticise
it
and
blame
it
in
his
own
mind
i
am
not
beautiful
enough
for
him
such
was
eugenie
s
thought
a
humble
thought
fertile
in
suffering
the
poor
girl
did
not
do
herself
justice
but
modesty
or
rather
fear
is
among
the
first
of
love
s
virtues
eugenie
belonged
to
the
type
of
children
with
sturdy
constitutions
such
as
we
see
among
the
lesser
bourgeoisie
whose
beauties
always
seem
a
little
vulgar
and
yet
though
she
resembled
the
venus
of
milo
the
lines
of
her
figure
were
ennobled
by
the
softer
christian
sentiment
which
purifies
womanhood
and
gives
it
a
distinction
unknown
to
the
sculptors
of
antiquity
she
had
an
enormous
head
with
the
masculine
yet
delicate
forehead
of
the
jupiter
of
phidias
and
gray
eyes
to
which
her
chaste
life
penetrating
fully
into
them
carried
a
flood
of
light
the
features
of
her
round
face
formerly
fresh
and
rosy
were
at
one
time
swollen
by
the
which
destroyed
the
velvet
texture
of
the
skin
though
it
kindly
left
no
other
traces
and
her
cheek
was
still
so
soft
and
delicate
that
her
mother
s
kiss
made
a
momentary
red
mark
upon
it
her
nose
was
somewhat
too
thick
but
it
harmonized
well
with
the
vermilion
mouth
whose
lips
creased
in
many
lines
were
full
of
love
and
kindness
the
throat
was
exquisitely
round
the
bust
well
curved
and
carefully
covered
attracted
the
eye
and
inspired
reverie
it
lacked
no
doubt
the
grace
which
a
fitting
dress
can
bestow
but
to
a
connoisseur
the
of
her
figure
had
its
own
charm
eugenie
tall
and
strongly
made
had
none
of
the
prettiness
which
pleases
the
masses
but
she
was
beautiful
with
a
beauty
which
the
spirit
recognizes
and
none
but
artists
truly
love
a
painter
seeking
here
below
for
a
type
of
mary
s
celestial
purity
searching
womankind
for
those
proud
modest
eyes
which
raphael
divined
for
those
virgin
lines
often
due
to
chances
of
conception
which
the
modesty
of
christian
life
alone
can
bestow
or
keep
unchanged
such
a
painter
in
love
with
his
ideal
would
have
found
in
the
face
of
eugenie
the
innate
nobleness
that
is
ignorant
of
itself
he
would
have
seen
beneath
the
calmness
of
that
brow
a
world
of
love
he
would
have
felt
in
the
shape
of
the
eyes
in
the
fall
of
the
eyelids
the
presence
of
the
nameless
something
that
we
call
divine
her
features
the
contour
of
her
head
which
no
expression
of
pleasure
had
ever
altered
or
wearied
were
like
the
lines
of
the
horizon
softly
traced
in
the
far
distance
across
the
tranquil
lakes
that
calm
and
rosy
countenance
margined
with
light
like
a
lovely
flower
rested
the
mind
held
the
eye
and
imparted
the
charm
of
the
conscience
that
was
there
reflected
eugenie
was
standing
on
the
shore
of
life
where
young
illusions
flower
where
daisies
are
gathered
with
delights
ere
long
to
be
unknown
and
thus
she
said
looking
at
her
image
in
the
glass
unconscious
as
yet
of
love
i
am
too
ugly
he
will
not
notice
then
she
opened
the
door
of
her
chamber
which
led
to
the
staircase
and
stretched
out
her
neck
to
listen
for
the
household
noises
he
is
not
up
she
thought
hearing
nanon
s
morning
cough
as
the
good
soul
went
and
came
sweeping
out
the
halls
lighting
her
fire
chaining
the
dog
and
speaking
to
the
beasts
in
the
stable
eugenie
at
once
went
down
and
ran
to
nanon
who
was
milking
the
cow
nanon
my
good
nanon
make
a
little
cream
for
my
cousin
s
why
mademoiselle
you
should
have
thought
of
that
yesterday
said
nanon
bursting
into
a
loud
peal
of
laughter
i
can
t
make
cream
your
cousin
is
a
darling
a
darling
oh
that
he
is
you
should
have
seen
him
in
his
all
silk
and
gold
i
saw
him
i
did
he
wears
linen
as
fine
as
the
surplice
of
monsieur
le
nanon
please
make
us
a
and
who
ll
give
me
wood
for
the
oven
and
flour
and
butter
for
the
cakes
said
nanon
who
in
her
function
of
to
grandet
assumed
at
times
enormous
importance
in
the
eyes
of
eugenie
and
her
mother
mustn
t
rob
the
master
to
feast
the
cousin
you
ask
him
for
butter
and
flour
and
wood
he
s
your
father
perhaps
he
ll
give
you
some
see
there
he
is
now
coming
to
give
out
the
eugenie
escaped
into
the
garden
quite
frightened
as
she
heard
the
staircase
shaking
under
her
father
s
step
already
she
felt
the
effects
of
that
virgin
modesty
and
that
special
consciousness
of
happiness
which
lead
us
to
fancy
not
perhaps
without
reason
that
our
thoughts
are
graven
on
our
foreheads
and
are
open
to
the
eyes
of
all
perceiving
for
the
first
time
the
cold
nakedness
of
her
father
s
house
the
poor
girl
felt
a
sort
of
rage
that
she
could
not
put
it
in
harmony
with
her
cousin
s
elegance
she
felt
the
need
of
doing
something
for
him
what
she
did
not
know
ingenuous
and
truthful
she
followed
her
angelic
nature
without
mistrusting
her
impressions
or
her
feelings
the
mere
sight
of
her
cousin
had
wakened
within
her
the
natural
yearnings
of
a
woman
yearnings
that
were
the
more
likely
to
develop
ardently
because
having
reached
her
year
she
was
in
the
plenitude
of
her
intelligence
and
her
desires
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
her
heart
was
full
of
terror
at
the
sight
of
her
father
in
him
she
saw
the
master
of
the
fate
and
she
fancied
herself
guilty
of
in
hiding
from
his
knowledge
certain
thoughts
she
walked
with
hasty
steps
surprised
to
breathe
a
purer
air
to
feel
the
sun
s
rays
quickening
her
pulses
to
absorb
from
their
heat
a
moral
warmth
and
a
new
life
as
she
turned
over
in
her
mind
some
stratagem
by
which
to
get
the
cake
a
quarrel
an
event
as
rare
as
the
sight
of
swallows
in
winter
broke
out
between
la
grande
nanon
and
grandet
armed
with
his
keys
the
master
had
come
to
dole
out
provisions
for
the
day
s
consumption
is
there
any
bread
left
from
yesterday
he
said
to
nanon
not
a
crumb
grandet
took
a
large
round
loaf
well
floured
and
moulded
in
one
of
the
flat
baskets
which
they
use
for
baking
in
anjou
and
was
about
to
cut
it
when
nanon
said
to
him
we
are
five
that
s
true
said
grandet
but
your
loaves
weigh
six
pounds
there
ll
be
some
left
besides
these
young
fellows
from
paris
don
t
eat
bread
you
ll
then
they
must
eat
said
nanon
is
a
word
of
the
local
lexicon
of
anjou
and
means
any
accompaniment
of
bread
from
butter
which
is
spread
upon
it
the
commonest
kind
of
to
peach
preserve
the
most
distinguished
of
all
the
those
who
in
their
childhood
have
licked
the
and
left
the
bread
will
comprehend
the
meaning
of
nanon
s
speech
no
answered
grandet
they
eat
neither
bread
nor
they
are
something
like
marriageable
after
ordering
the
meals
for
the
day
with
his
usual
parsimony
the
goodman
having
locked
the
closets
containing
the
supplies
was
about
to
go
towards
the
when
nanon
stopped
him
to
say
monsieur
give
me
a
little
flour
and
some
butter
and
i
ll
make
a
for
the
young
are
you
going
to
pillage
the
house
on
account
of
my
nephew
i
wasn
t
thinking
any
more
of
your
nephew
than
i
was
of
your
dog
not
more
than
you
think
yourself
for
look
here
you
ve
only
forked
out
six
bits
of
sugar
i
want
what
s
all
this
nanon
i
have
never
seen
you
like
this
before
what
have
you
got
in
your
head
are
you
the
mistress
here
you
sha
n
t
have
more
than
six
pieces
of
well
then
how
is
your
nephew
to
sweeten
his
coffee
with
two
pieces
i
ll
go
without
go
without
sugar
at
your
age
i
d
rather
buy
you
some
out
of
my
own
mind
your
own
in
spite
of
the
recent
fall
in
prices
sugar
was
still
in
grandet
s
eyes
the
most
valuable
of
all
the
colonial
products
to
him
it
was
always
six
francs
a
pound
the
necessity
of
economizing
it
acquired
under
the
empire
had
grown
to
be
the
most
inveterate
of
his
habits
all
women
even
the
greatest
ninnies
know
how
to
dodge
and
dodge
to
get
their
ends
nanon
abandoned
the
sugar
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
mademoiselle
she
called
through
the
window
do
you
want
some
no
no
answered
eugenie
come
nanon
said
grandet
hearing
his
daughter
s
voice
see
he
opened
the
cupboard
where
the
flour
was
kept
gave
her
a
cupful
and
added
a
few
ounces
of
butter
to
the
piece
he
had
already
cut
off
i
shall
want
wood
for
the
oven
said
the
implacable
nanon
well
take
what
you
want
he
answered
sadly
but
in
that
case
you
must
make
us
a
and
you
ll
cook
the
whole
dinner
in
the
oven
in
that
way
you
won
t
need
two
goodness
cried
nanon
you
needn
t
tell
me
grandet
cast
a
look
that
was
paternal
upon
his
faithful
deputy
mademoiselle
she
cried
when
his
back
was
turned
we
shall
have
the
pere
grandet
returned
from
the
garden
with
the
fruit
and
arranged
a
plateful
on
the
just
see
monsieur
said
nanon
what
pretty
boots

nephew

what
leather

smells
good

with
i
wonder

kind
of
leather

will
get
you
something

in
saumur
to
polish
those
boots
with

have
heard
that
they
put
sugar
into
the
blacking
to
make
it
they
look
good
to
eat
said
the
cook
putting
the
boots
to
her
nose
bless
me
if
they
don
t
smell
like
madame
s
ah
how
funny
funny
said
her
master
do
you
call
it
funny
to
put
more
money
into
boots
than
the
man
who
stands
in
them
is
worth
monsieur
she
said
when
grandet
returned
the
second
time
after
locking
the
won
t
you
have
the
put
on
once
or
twice
a
week
on
account
of

nephew

the
butcher

we
will
make
the
broth
of
fowls
the
farmers

bring
them
i
shall
tell
cornoiller
to
shoot
some
crows

make
the
best
soup
in
the
isn
t
it
true
monsieur
that
crows

the
dead
you
are
a
fool
nanon
they
eat
what
they
can
get
like
the
rest
of
the
world
don
t
we
all
live
on
the
dead
what
are
legacies
monsieur
grandet
having
no
further
orders
to
give
drew
out
his
watch
and
seeing
that
he
had
half
an
hour
to
dispose
of
before
breakfast
he
took
his
hat
went
and
kissed
his
daughter
and
said
to
her
do
you
want
to
come
for
a
walk
in
the
fields
down
by
the
loire
i
have
something
to
do
eugenie
fetched
her
straw
bonnet
lined
with
pink
taffeta
then
the
father
and
daughter
went
down
the
winding
street
to
the
shore
where
are
you
going
at
this
early
hour
said
cruchot
the
notary
meeting
them
to
see
something
answered
grandet
not
duped
by
the
matutinal
appearance
of
his
friend
when
pere
grandet
went
to
see
something
the
notary
knew
by
experience
there
was
something
to
be
got
by
going
with
him
so
he
went
come
cruchot
said
grandet
you
are
one
of
my
friends
i
ll
show
you
what
folly
it
is
to
plant
on
good
do
you
call
the
sixty
thousand
francs
that
you
pocketed
for
those
that
were
in
your
fields
down
by
the
loire
folly
said
maitre
cruchot
opening
his
eyes
with
amazement
what
luck
you
have
had
to
cut
down
your
trees
at
the
very
time
they
ran
short
of
at
nantes
and
to
sell
them
at
thirty
francs
eugenie
listened
without
knowing
that
she
approached
the
most
solemn
moment
of
her
whole
life
and
that
the
notary
was
about
to
bring
down
upon
her
head
a
paternal
and
supreme
sentence
grandet
had
now
reached
the
magnificent
fields
which
he
owned
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
where
thirty
workmen
were
employed
in
clearing
away
filling
up
and
levelling
the
spots
formerly
occupied
by
the
poplars
maitre
cruchot
see
how
much
ground
this
tree
once
took
up
jean
he
cried
to
a
laborer
with
your
four
times
eight
feet
said
the
man
feet
lost
said
grandet
to
cruchot
i
had
three
hundred
poplars
in
this
one
line
isn
t
that
so
well
then
three
times
lost
five
hundred
in
add
twice
as
much
for
the
side
rows
fifteen
hundred
the
middle
rows
as
much
more
so
we
may
it
a
of
very
good
said
cruchot
to
help
out
his
friend
a
thousand
bales
are
worth
about
six
hundred
say
hundred
there
s
three
or
four
hundred
francs
on
the
second
crop
well
then
that
thousand
francs
a
year
for
years
with
interest
to
say
sixty
thousand
francs
said
the
notary
i
am
willing
sixty
very
good
continued
grandet
without
stuttering
two
thousand
poplars
forty
years
old
will
only
yield
me
fifty
thousand
francs
there
s
a
loss
i
have
found
that
myself
said
grandet
getting
on
his
high
horse
jean
fill
up
all
the
holes
except
those
at
the
bank
of
the
river
there
you
are
to
plant
the
poplars
i
have
bought
plant
em
there
and
they
ll
get
nourishment
from
the
government
he
said
turning
to
cruchot
and
giving
a
slight
motion
to
the
wen
on
his
nose
which
expressed
more
than
the
most
ironical
of
smiles
true
enough
poplars
should
only
be
planted
on
poor
soil
said
cruchot
amazed
at
grandet
s
calculations
monsieur
answered
the
old
man
satirically
eugenie
who
was
gazing
at
the
sublime
scenery
of
the
loire
and
paying
no
attention
to
her
father
s
reckonings
presently
turned
an
ear
to
the
remarks
of
cruchot
when
she
heard
him
say
so
you
have
brought
a
from
paris
all
saumur
is
talking
about
your
nephew
i
shall
soon
have
the
to
draw
up
hey
pere
grandet
you
up
very
early
to
me
that
said
grandet
accompanying
the
remark
with
a
motion
of
his
wen
well
old
i
ll
be
frank
and
you
what
you
want
know
i
would
rather
do
you
see
my
daughter
into
the
loire
than
her
to
her
you
may
that
everywhere
no
never
mind
let
the
world
this
answer
dazzled
and
blinded
the
young
girl
with
sudden
light
the
distant
hopes
upspringing
in
her
heart
bloomed
suddenly
became
real
tangible
like
a
cluster
of
flowers
and
she
saw
them
cut
down
and
wilting
on
the
earth
since
the
previous
evening
she
had
attached
herself
to
charles
by
those
links
of
happiness
which
bind
soul
to
soul
from
henceforth
suffering
was
to
rivet
them
is
it
not
the
noble
destiny
of
women
to
be
more
moved
by
the
dark
solemnities
of
grief
than
by
the
splendors
of
fortune
how
was
it
that
fatherly
feeling
had
died
out
of
her
father
s
heart
of
what
crime
had
charles
been
guilty
mysterious
questions
already
her
dawning
love
a
mystery
so
profound
was
wrapping
itself
in
mystery
she
walked
back
trembling
in
all
her
limbs
and
when
she
reached
the
gloomy
street
lately
so
joyous
to
her
she
felt
its
sadness
she
breathed
the
melancholy
which
time
and
events
had
printed
there
none
of
love
s
lessons
lacked
a
few
steps
from
their
own
door
she
went
on
before
her
father
and
waited
at
the
threshold
but
grandet
who
saw
a
newspaper
in
the
notary
s
hand
stopped
short
and
asked
how
are
the
funds
you
never
listen
to
my
advice
grandet
answered
cruchot
buy
soon
you
will
still
make
twenty
per
cent
in
two
years
besides
getting
an
excellent
rate
of
interest
five
thousand
a
year
for
eighty
thousand
francs
fifty
we
ll
see
about
that
answered
grandet
rubbing
his
chin
good
god
exclaimed
the
notary
well
what
cried
grandet
and
at
the
same
moment
cruchot
put
the
newspaper
under
his
eyes
and
said
read
that
monsieur
grandet
one
of
the
most
respected
merchants
in
paris
blew
his
brains
out
yesterday
after
making
his
usual
appearance
at
the
bourse
he
had
sent
his
resignation
to
the
president
of
the
chamber
of
deputies
and
had
also
resigned
his
functions
as
a
judge
of
the
commercial
courts
the
failures
of
monsieur
roguin
and
monsieur
souchet
his
broker
and
his
notary
had
ruined
him
the
esteem
felt
for
monsieur
grandet
and
the
credit
he
enjoyed
were
nevertheless
such
that
he
might
have
obtained
the
necessary
assistance
from
other
business
houses
it
is
much
to
be
regretted
that
so
honorable
a
man
should
have
yielded
to
momentary
despair
etc
i
knew
it
said
the
old
to
the
notary
the
words
sent
a
chill
of
horror
through
maitre
cruchot
who
notwithstanding
his
impassibility
as
a
notary
felt
the
cold
running
down
his
spine
as
he
thought
that
grandet
of
paris
had
possibly
implored
in
vain
the
millions
of
grandet
of
saumur
and
his
son
so
joyous
yesterday
he
knows
nothing
as
yet
answered
grandet
with
the
same
composure
adieu
monsieur
grandet
said
cruchot
who
now
understood
the
state
of
the
case
and
went
off
to
reassure
monsieur
de
bonfons
on
entering
grandet
found
breakfast
ready
madame
grandet
round
whose
neck
eugenie
had
flung
her
arms
kissing
her
with
the
quick
effusion
of
feeling
often
caused
by
secret
grief
was
already
seated
in
her
chair
on
castors
knitting
sleeves
for
the
coming
winter
you
can
begin
to
eat
said
nanon
coming
downstairs
four
steps
at
a
time
the
young
one
is
sleeping
like
a
cherub
isn
t
he
a
darling
with
his
eyes
shut
i
went
in
and
i
called
him
no
let
him
sleep
said
grandet
he
ll
wake
soon
enough
to
hear
what
is
it
asked
eugenie
putting
into
her
coffee
the
two
little
bits
of
sugar
weighing
less
than
half
an
ounce
which
the
old
miser
amused
himself
by
cutting
up
in
his
leisure
hours
madame
grandet
who
did
not
dare
to
put
the
question
gazed
at
her
husband
his
father
has
blown
his
brains
my
uncle
said
eugenie
poor
young
man
exclaimed
madame
grandet
poor
indeed
said
grandet
he
isn
t
worth
a
sou
eh
poor
boy
and
he
s
sleeping
like
the
king
of
the
world
said
nanon
in
a
gentle
voice
eugenie
stopped
eating
her
heart
was
wrung
as
the
young
heart
is
wrung
when
pity
for
the
suffering
of
one
she
loves
overflows
for
the
first
time
the
whole
being
of
a
woman
the
poor
girl
wept
what
are
you
crying
about
you
didn
t
know
your
uncle
said
her
father
giving
her
one
of
those
hungry
tigerish
looks
he
doubtless
threw
upon
his
piles
of
gold
but
monsieur
said
nanon
who
wouldn
t
feel
pity
for
the
poor
young
man
sleeping
there
like
a
wooden
shoe
without
knowing
what
s
coming
i
didn
t
speak
to
you
nanon
hold
your
tongue
eugenie
learned
at
that
moment
that
the
woman
who
loves
must
be
able
to
hide
her
feelings
she
did
not
answer
you
will
say
nothing
to
him
about
it
ma
ame
grandet
till
i
return
said
the
old
man
i
have
to
go
and
straighten
the
line
of
my
hedge
along
the
i
shall
be
back
at
noon
in
time
for
the
second
breakfast
and
then
i
will
talk
with
my
nephew
about
his
affairs
as
for
you
mademoiselle
eugenie
if
it
is
for
that
dandy
you
are
crying
that
s
enough
child
he
s
going
off
like
a
shot
to
the
indies
you
will
never
see
him
the
father
took
his
gloves
from
the
brim
of
his
hat
put
them
on
with
his
usual
composure
pushed
them
in
place
by
shoving
the
fingers
of
both
hands
together
and
went
out
mamma
i
am
suffocating
cried
eugenie
when
she
was
alone
with
her
mother
i
have
never
suffered
like
madame
grandet
seeing
that
she
turned
pale
opened
the
window
and
let
her
breathe
fresh
air
i
feel
better
said
eugenie
after
a
moment
this
nervous
excitement
in
a
nature
hitherto
to
all
appearance
calm
and
cold
reacted
on
madame
grandet
she
looked
at
her
daughter
with
the
sympathetic
intuition
with
which
mothers
are
gifted
for
the
objects
of
their
tenderness
and
guessed
all
in
truth
the
life
of
the
hungarian
sisters
bound
together
by
a
freak
of
nature
could
scarcely
have
been
more
intimate
than
that
of
eugenie
and
her
mother
always
together
in
the
embrasure
of
that
window
and
sleeping
together
in
the
same
atmosphere
my
poor
child
said
madame
grandet
taking
eugenie
s
head
and
laying
it
upon
her
bosom
at
these
words
the
young
girl
raised
her
head
questioned
her
mother
by
a
look
and
seemed
to
search
out
her
inmost
thought
why
send
him
to
the
indies
she
said
if
he
is
unhappy
ought
he
not
to
stay
with
us
is
he
not
our
nearest
relation
yes
my
child
it
seems
natural
but
your
father
has
his
reasons
we
must
respect
the
mother
and
daughter
sat
down
in
silence
the
former
upon
her
raised
seat
the
latter
in
her
little
armchair
and
both
took
up
their
work
swelling
with
gratitude
for
the
full
her
mother
had
given
her
eugenie
kissed
the
dear
hand
saying
how
good
you
are
my
kind
mamma
the
words
sent
a
glow
of
light
into
the
motherly
face
worn
and
blighted
as
it
was
by
many
sorrows
you
like
him
asked
eugenie
madame
grandet
only
smiled
in
reply
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
she
said
in
a
low
voice
do
you
love
him
already
that
is
wrong
said
eugenie
why
is
it
wrong
you
are
pleased
with
him
nanon
is
pleased
with
him
why
should
he
not
please
me
come
mamma
let
us
set
the
table
for
his
she
threw
down
her
work
and
her
mother
did
the
same
saying
foolish
child
but
she
sanctioned
the
child
s
folly
by
sharing
it
eugenie
called
nanon
what
do
you
want
now
mademoiselle
nanon
can
we
have
cream
by
midday
ah
midday
to
be
sure
you
can
answered
the
old
servant
well
let
him
have
his
coffee
very
strong
i
heard
monsieur
des
grassins
say
that
they
make
the
coffee
very
strong
in
paris
put
in
a
great
where
am
i
to
get
it
buy
suppose
monsieur
meets
me
he
has
gone
to
his
i
ll
run
then
but
monsieur
fessard
asked
me
yesterday
if
the
magi
had
come
to
stay
with
us
when
i
bought
the
wax
candle
all
the
town
will
know
our
if
your
father
finds
it
out
said
madame
grandet
he
is
capable
of
beating
well
let
him
beat
us
we
will
take
his
blows
on
our
madame
grandet
for
all
answer
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
nanon
put
on
her
hood
and
went
off
eugenie
got
out
some
clean
and
went
to
fetch
a
few
bunches
of
grapes
which
she
had
amused
herself
by
hanging
on
a
string
across
the
attic
she
walked
softly
along
the
corridor
so
as
not
to
waken
her
cousin
and
she
could
not
help
listening
at
the
door
to
his
quiet
breathing
sorrow
is
watching
while
he
sleeps
she
thought
she
took
the
freshest
and
arranged
her
dish
of
grapes
as
coquettishly
as
a
practised
might
have
done
and
placed
it
triumphantly
on
the
table
she
laid
hands
on
the
pears
counted
out
by
her
father
and
piled
them
in
a
pyramid
mixed
with
leaves
she
went
and
came
and
skipped
and
ran
she
would
have
liked
to
lay
under
contribution
everything
in
her
father
s
house
but
the
keys
were
in
his
pocket
nanon
came
back
with
two
fresh
eggs
at
sight
of
them
eugenie
almost
hugged
her
round
the
neck
the
farmer
from
lande
had
them
in
his
basket
i
asked
him
for
them
and
he
gave
them
to
me
the
darling
for
nothing
as
an
attention
v
after
two
hours
thought
and
care
during
which
eugenie
jumped
up
twenty
times
from
her
work
to
see
if
the
coffee
were
boiling
or
to
go
and
listen
to
the
noise
her
cousin
made
in
dressing
she
succeeded
in
preparing
a
simple
little
breakfast
very
inexpensive
but
which
nevertheless
departed
alarmingly
from
the
inveterate
customs
of
the
house
the
midday
breakfast
was
always
taken
standing
each
took
a
slice
of
bread
a
little
fruit
or
some
butter
and
a
glass
of
wine
as
eugenie
looked
at
the
table
drawn
up
near
the
fire
with
an
placed
before
her
cousin
s
plate
at
the
two
dishes
of
fruit
the
the
bottle
of
white
wine
the
bread
and
the
sugar
heaped
up
in
a
saucer
she
trembled
in
all
her
limbs
at
the
mere
thought
of
the
look
her
father
would
give
her
if
he
should
come
in
at
that
moment
she
glanced
often
at
the
clock
to
see
if
her
cousin
could
breakfast
before
the
master
s
return
don
t
be
troubled
eugenie
if
your
father
comes
in
i
will
take
it
all
upon
myself
said
madame
grandet
eugenie
could
not
repress
a
tear
oh
my
good
mother
she
cried
i
have
never
loved
you
charles
who
had
been
tramping
about
his
room
for
some
time
singing
to
himself
now
came
down
happily
it
was
only
eleven
o
clock
the
true
parisian
he
had
put
as
much
dandyism
into
his
dress
as
if
he
were
in
the
chateau
of
the
noble
lady
then
travelling
in
scotland
he
came
into
the
room
with
the
smiling
courteous
manner
so
becoming
to
youth
which
made
eugenie
s
heart
beat
with
mournful
joy
he
had
taken
the
destruction
of
his
castles
in
anjou
as
a
joke
and
came
up
to
his
aunt
gaily
have
you
slept
well
dear
aunt
and
you
too
my
cousin
very
well
monsieur
did
you
said
madame
grandet
i
you
must
be
hungry
cousin
said
eugenie
will
you
take
your
seat
i
never
breakfast
before
midday
i
never
get
up
till
then
however
i
fared
so
badly
on
the
journey
that
i
am
glad
to
eat
something
at
once
besides
here
he
pulled
out
the
prettiest
watch
breguet
ever
made
dear
me
i
am
early
it
is
only
eleven
o
clock
early
said
madame
grandet
yes
but
i
wanted
to
put
my
things
in
order
well
i
shall
be
glad
to
have
anything
to
eat
anything
it
doesn
t
matter
what
a
chicken
a
holy
virgin
exclaimed
nanon
overhearing
the
words
a
partridge
whispered
eugenie
to
herself
she
would
gladly
have
given
the
whole
of
her
little
hoard
for
a
partridge
come
and
sit
down
said
his
aunt
the
young
dandy
let
himself
drop
into
an
just
as
a
pretty
woman
falls
gracefully
upon
a
sofa
eugenie
and
her
mother
took
ordinary
chairs
and
sat
beside
him
near
the
fire
do
you
always
live
here
said
charles
thinking
the
room
uglier
by
daylight
than
it
had
seemed
the
night
before
always
answered
eugenie
looking
at
him
except
during
the
vintage
then
we
go
and
help
nanon
and
live
at
the
abbaye
des
don
t
you
ever
take
walks
sometimes
on
sunday
after
vespers
when
the
weather
is
fine
said
madame
grandet
we
walk
on
the
bridge
or
we
go
and
watch
the
have
you
a
theatre
go
to
the
theatre
exclaimed
madame
grandet
see
a
play
why
monsieur
don
t
you
know
it
is
a
mortal
sin
see
here
monsieur
said
nanon
bringing
in
the
eggs
here
are
your
chickens
in
the
oh
fresh
eggs
said
charles
who
like
all
people
accustomed
to
luxury
had
already
forgotten
about
his
partridge
that
is
delicious
now
if
you
will
give
me
the
butter
my
good
butter
then
you
can
t
have
the
nanon
bring
the
butter
cried
eugenie
the
young
girl
watched
her
cousin
as
he
cut
his
sippets
with
as
much
pleasure
as
a
grisette
takes
in
a
melodrama
where
innocence
and
virtue
triumph
charles
brought
up
by
a
charming
mother
improved
and
trained
by
a
woman
of
fashion
had
the
elegant
dainty
foppish
movements
of
a
coxcomb
the
compassionate
sympathy
and
tenderness
of
a
young
girl
possess
a
power
that
is
actually
magnetic
so
that
charles
finding
himself
the
object
of
the
attentions
of
his
aunt
and
cousin
could
not
escape
the
influence
of
feelings
which
flowed
towards
him
as
it
were
and
inundated
him
he
gave
eugenie
a
bright
caressing
look
full
of
kindness
a
look
which
seemed
itself
a
smile
he
perceived
as
his
eyes
lingered
upon
her
the
exquisite
harmony
of
features
in
the
pure
face
the
grace
of
her
innocent
attitude
the
magic
clearness
of
the
eyes
where
young
love
sparkled
and
desire
shone
unconsciously
ah
my
dear
cousin
if
you
were
in
full
dress
at
the
opera
i
assure
you
my
aunt
s
words
would
come
true
you
would
make
the
men
commit
the
mortal
sin
of
envy
and
the
women
the
sin
of
the
compliment
went
to
eugenie
s
heart
and
set
it
beating
though
she
did
not
understand
its
meaning
oh
cousin
she
said
you
are
laughing
at
a
poor
little
country
if
you
knew
me
my
cousin
you
would
know
that
i
abhor
ridicule
it
withers
the
heart
and
jars
upon
all
my
here
he
swallowed
his
buttered
sippet
very
gracefully
no
i
really
have
not
enough
mind
to
make
fun
of
others
and
doubtless
it
is
a
great
defect
in
paris
when
they
want
to
disparage
a
man
they
say
he
has
a
good
the
phrase
means
the
poor
fellow
is
as
stupid
as
a
but
as
i
am
rich
and
known
to
hit
the
bull
at
thirty
paces
with
any
kind
of
pistol
and
even
in
the
open
fields
ridicule
respects
my
dear
nephew
that
bespeaks
a
good
you
have
a
very
pretty
ring
said
eugenie
is
there
any
harm
in
asking
to
see
it
charles
held
out
his
hand
after
loosening
the
ring
and
eugenie
blushed
as
she
touched
the
pink
nails
of
her
cousin
with
the
tips
of
her
fingers
see
mamma
what
beautiful
my
there
s
a
lot
of
gold
said
nanon
bringing
in
the
coffee
what
is
that
exclaimed
charles
laughing
as
he
pointed
to
an
oblong
pot
of
brown
earthenware
glazed
on
the
inside
and
edged
with
a
fringe
of
ashes
from
the
bottom
of
which
the
were
bubbling
up
and
falling
in
the
boiling
liquid
it
is
boiled
coffee
said
nanon
ah
my
dear
aunt
i
shall
at
least
leave
one
beneficent
trace
of
my
visit
here
you
are
indeed
behind
the
age
i
must
teach
you
to
make
good
coffee
in
a
chaptal
he
tried
to
explain
the
process
of
a
chaptal
gracious
if
there
are
so
many
things
as
all
that
to
do
said
nanon
we
may
as
well
give
up
our
lives
to
it
i
shall
never
make
coffee
that
way
i
know
that
pray
who
is
to
get
the
fodder
for
the
cow
while
i
make
the
coffee
i
will
make
it
said
eugenie
child
said
madame
grandet
looking
at
her
daughter
the
word
recalled
to
their
minds
the
sorrow
that
was
about
to
fall
upon
the
unfortunate
young
man
the
three
women
were
silent
and
looked
at
him
with
an
air
of
commiseration
that
caught
his
attention
is
anything
the
matter
my
cousin
he
said
hush
said
madame
grandet
to
eugenie
who
was
about
to
answer
you
know
my
daughter
that
your
father
charged
us
not
to
speak
to
monsieur
say
charles
said
young
grandet
ah
you
are
called
charles
what
a
beautiful
name
cried
eugenie
presentiments
of
evil
are
almost
always
justified
at
this
moment
nanon
madame
grandet
and
eugenie
who
had
all
three
been
thinking
with
a
shudder
of
the
old
man
s
return
heard
the
knock
whose
echoes
they
knew
but
too
well
there
s
papa
said
eugenie
she
removed
the
saucer
filled
with
sugar
leaving
a
few
pieces
on
the
nanon
carried
off
the
madame
grandet
sat
up
like
a
frightened
hare
it
was
evidently
a
panic
which
amazed
charles
who
was
wholly
unable
to
understand
it
why
what
is
the
matter
he
asked
my
father
has
come
answered
eugenie
well
what
of
that
monsieur
grandet
entered
the
room
threw
his
keen
eye
upon
the
table
upon
charles
and
saw
the
whole
thing
ha
ha
so
you
have
been
making
a
feast
for
your
nephew
very
good
very
good
very
good
indeed
he
said
without
stuttering
when
the
cat
s
away
the
mice
will
feast
thought
charles
incapable
of
suspecting
or
imagining
the
rules
and
customs
of
the
household
give
me
my
glass
nanon
said
the
master
eugenie
brought
the
glass
grandet
drew
a
knife
with
a
big
blade
from
his
breeches
pocket
cut
a
slice
of
bread
took
a
small
bit
of
butter
spread
it
carefully
on
the
bread
and
ate
it
standing
at
this
moment
charlie
was
sweetening
his
coffee
pere
grandet
saw
the
bits
of
sugar
looked
at
his
wife
who
turned
pale
and
made
three
steps
forward
he
leaned
down
to
the
poor
woman
s
ear
and
said
where
did
you
get
all
that
sugar
nanon
fetched
it
from
fessard
s
there
was
it
is
impossible
to
picture
the
profound
interest
the
three
women
took
in
this
mute
scene
nanon
had
left
her
kitchen
and
stood
looking
into
the
room
to
see
what
would
happen
charles
having
tasted
his
coffee
found
it
bitter
and
glanced
about
for
the
sugar
which
grandet
had
already
put
away
what
do
you
want
said
his
uncle
the
put
in
more
milk
answered
the
master
of
the
house
your
coffee
will
taste
eugenie
took
the
saucer
which
grandet
had
put
away
and
placed
it
on
the
table
looking
calmly
at
her
father
as
she
did
so
most
assuredly
the
parisian
woman
who
held
a
silken
ladder
with
her
feeble
arms
to
facilitate
the
flight
of
her
lover
showed
no
greater
courage
than
eugenie
displayed
when
she
replaced
the
sugar
upon
the
table
the
lover
rewarded
his
mistress
when
she
proudly
showed
him
her
beautiful
bruised
arm
and
bathed
every
swollen
vein
with
tears
and
kisses
till
it
was
cured
with
happiness
charles
on
the
other
hand
never
so
much
as
knew
the
secret
of
the
cruel
agitation
that
shook
and
bruised
the
heart
of
his
cousin
crushed
as
it
was
by
the
look
of
the
old
miser
you
are
not
eating
your
breakfast
the
poor
helot
came
forward
with
a
piteous
look
cut
herself
a
piece
of
bread
and
took
a
pear
eugenie
boldly
offered
her
father
some
grapes
saying
taste
my
preserves
papa
my
cousin
you
will
eat
some
will
you
not
i
went
to
get
these
pretty
grapes
expressly
for
if
no
one
stops
them
they
will
pillage
saumur
for
you
nephew
when
you
have
finished
we
will
go
into
the
garden
i
have
something
to
tell
you
which
can
t
be
eugenie
and
her
mother
cast
a
look
on
charles
whose
meaning
the
young
man
could
not
mistake
what
is
it
you
mean
uncle
since
the
death
of
my
poor
mother
at
these
words
his
voice
softened
no
other
sorrow
can
touch
my
nephew
who
knows
by
what
afflictions
god
is
pleased
to
try
us
said
his
aunt
ta
ta
ta
ta
said
grandet
there
s
your
nonsense
beginning
i
am
sorry
to
see
those
white
hands
of
yours
nephew
and
he
showed
the
fists
which
nature
had
put
at
the
end
of
his
own
arms
there
s
a
pair
of
hands
made
to
pick
up
silver
pieces
you
ve
been
brought
up
to
put
your
feet
in
the
kid
out
of
which
we
make
the
purses
we
keep
our
money
in
a
bad
very
bad
what
do
you
mean
uncle
i
ll
be
hanged
if
i
understand
a
single
word
of
what
you
are
come
said
grandet
the
miser
closed
the
blade
of
his
knife
with
a
snap
drank
the
last
of
his
wine
and
opened
the
door
my
cousin
take
courage
the
tone
of
the
young
girl
struck
terror
to
charles
s
heart
and
he
followed
his
terrible
uncle
a
prey
to
disquieting
thoughts
eugenie
her
mother
and
nanon
went
into
the
kitchen
moved
by
irresistible
curiosity
to
watch
the
two
actors
in
the
scene
which
was
about
to
take
place
in
the
garden
where
at
first
the
uncle
walked
silently
ahead
of
the
nephew
grandet
was
not
at
all
troubled
at
having
to
tell
charles
of
the
death
of
his
father
but
he
did
feel
a
sort
of
compassion
in
knowing
him
to
be
without
a
penny
and
he
sought
for
some
phrase
or
formula
by
which
to
soften
the
communication
of
that
cruel
truth
you
have
lost
your
father
seemed
to
him
a
mere
nothing
to
say
fathers
die
before
their
children
but
you
are
absolutely
without
means
all
the
misfortunes
of
life
were
summed
up
in
those
words
grandet
walked
round
the
garden
three
times
the
gravel
crunching
under
his
heavy
step
in
the
crucial
moments
of
life
our
minds
fasten
upon
the
locality
where
joys
or
sorrows
overwhelm
us
charles
noticed
with
minute
attention
the
of
the
little
garden
the
yellow
leaves
as
they
fluttered
down
the
dilapidated
walls
the
gnarled
picturesque
details
which
were
destined
to
remain
forever
in
his
memory
blending
eternally
by
the
mnemonics
that
belong
exclusively
to
the
passions
with
the
recollections
of
this
solemn
hour
it
is
very
fine
weather
very
warm
said
grandet
drawing
a
long
breath
yes
uncle
but
why
well
my
lad
answered
his
uncle
i
have
some
bad
news
to
give
you
your
father
is
ill
then
why
am
i
here
said
charles
nanon
he
cried
order
i
can
get
a
carriage
somewhere
he
added
turning
to
his
uncle
who
stood
motionless
horses
and
carriages
are
useless
answered
grandet
looking
at
charles
who
remained
silent
his
eyes
growing
fixed
yes
my
poor
boy
you
guess
the
truth
he
is
dead
but
that
s
nothing
there
is
something
worse
he
blew
out
his
my
father
yes
but
that
s
not
the
worst
the
newspapers
are
all
talking
about
it
here
read
grandet
who
had
borrowed
the
fatal
article
from
cruchot
thrust
the
paper
under
his
nephew
s
eyes
the
poor
young
man
still
a
child
still
at
an
age
when
feelings
wear
no
mask
burst
into
tears
that
s
good
thought
grandet
his
eyes
frightened
me
he
ll
be
all
right
if
he
weeps
that
is
not
the
worst
my
poor
nephew
he
said
aloud
not
noticing
whether
charles
heard
him
that
is
nothing
you
will
get
over
it
but
never
never
my
father
oh
my
father
he
has
ruined
you
you
haven
t
a
what
does
that
matter
my
father
where
is
my
father
his
sobs
resounded
horribly
against
those
dreary
walls
and
reverberated
in
the
echoes
the
three
women
filled
with
pity
wept
also
for
tears
are
often
as
contagious
as
laughter
charles
without
listening
further
to
his
uncle
ran
through
the
court
and
up
the
staircase
to
his
chamber
where
he
threw
himself
across
the
bed
and
hid
his
face
in
the
sheets
to
weep
in
peace
for
his
lost
parents
the
first
burst
must
have
its
way
said
grandet
entering
the
where
eugenie
and
her
mother
had
hastily
resumed
their
seats
and
were
sewing
with
trembling
hands
after
wiping
their
eyes
but
that
young
man
is
good
for
nothing
his
head
is
more
taken
up
with
the
dead
than
with
his
eugenie
shuddered
as
she
heard
her
father
s
comment
on
the
most
sacred
of
all
griefs
from
that
moment
she
began
to
judge
him
charles
s
sobs
though
muffled
still
sounded
through
the
sepulchral
house
and
his
deep
groans
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
earth
beneath
only
ceased
towards
evening
after
growing
gradually
feebler
poor
young
man
said
madame
grandet
fatal
exclamation
pere
grandet
looked
at
his
wife
at
eugenie
and
at
the
he
recollected
the
extraordinary
breakfast
prepared
for
the
unfortunate
youth
and
he
took
a
position
in
the
middle
of
the
room
listen
to
me
he
said
with
his
usual
composure
i
hope
that
you
will
not
continue
this
extravagance
madame
grandet
i
don
t
give
you
my
money
to
stuff
that
young
fellow
with
my
mother
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
said
eugenie
it
was
i
who
is
it
because
you
are
of
age
said
grandet
interrupting
his
daughter
that
you
choose
to
contradict
me
remember
eugenie
father
the
son
of
your
brother
ought
to
receive
from
us
ta
ta
ta
ta
exclaimed
the
cooper
on
four
chromatic
tones
the
son
of
my
brother
this
my
nephew
that
charles
is
nothing
at
all
to
us
he
hasn
t
a
farthing
his
father
has
failed
and
when
this
dandy
has
cried
his
fill
off
he
goes
from
here
i
won
t
have
him
revolutionize
my
what
is
failing
father
asked
eugenie
to
fail
answered
her
father
is
to
commit
the
most
dishonorable
action
that
can
disgrace
a
it
must
be
a
great
sin
said
madame
grandet
and
our
brother
may
be
there
there
don
t
begin
with
your
litanies
said
grandet
shrugging
his
shoulders
to
fail
eugenie
he
resumed
is
to
commit
a
theft
which
the
law
unfortunately
takes
under
its
protection
people
have
given
their
property
to
guillaume
grandet
trusting
to
his
reputation
for
honor
and
integrity
he
has
made
away
with
it
all
and
left
them
nothing
but
their
eyes
to
weep
with
a
highway
robber
is
better
than
a
bankrupt
the
one
attacks
you
and
you
can
defend
yourself
he
risks
his
own
life
but
the
other
in
short
charles
is
the
words
rang
in
the
poor
girl
s
heart
and
weighed
it
down
with
their
heavy
meaning
upright
and
delicate
as
a
flower
born
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
she
knew
nothing
of
the
world
s
maxims
of
its
deceitful
arguments
and
specious
sophisms
she
therefore
believed
the
atrocious
explanation
which
her
father
gave
her
designedly
concealing
the
distinction
which
exists
between
an
involuntary
failure
and
an
intentional
one
father
could
you
not
have
prevented
such
a
misfortune
my
brother
did
not
consult
me
besides
he
owes
four
what
is
a
million
father
she
asked
with
the
simplicity
of
a
child
which
thinks
it
can
find
out
at
once
all
that
it
wants
to
know
a
million
said
grandet
why
it
is
a
million
pieces
of
twenty
sous
each
and
it
takes
five
twenty
sous
pieces
to
make
five
dear
me
cried
eugenie
how
could
my
uncle
possibly
have
had
four
millions
is
there
any
one
else
in
france
who
ever
had
so
many
millions
pere
grandet
stroked
his
chin
smiled
and
his
wen
seemed
to
dilate
but
what
will
become
of
my
cousin
charles
he
is
going
off
to
the
west
indies
by
his
father
s
request
and
he
will
try
to
make
his
fortune
has
he
got
the
money
to
go
with
i
shall
pay
for
his
journey
as
far
as
yes
as
far
as
eugenie
sprang
into
his
arms
oh
father
how
good
you
are
she
kissed
him
with
a
warmth
that
almost
made
grandet
ashamed
of
himself
for
his
conscience
galled
him
a
little
will
it
take
much
time
to
amass
a
million
she
asked
look
here
said
the
old
miser
you
know
what
a
napoleon
is
well
it
takes
fifty
thousand
napoleons
to
make
a
mamma
we
must
say
a
great
many
for
i
was
thinking
so
said
madame
grandet
that
s
the
way
always
spending
my
money
cried
the
father
do
you
think
there
are
francs
on
every
bush
at
this
moment
a
muffled
cry
more
distressing
than
all
the
others
echoed
through
the
garrets
and
struck
a
chill
to
the
hearts
of
eugenie
and
her
mother
nanon
go
upstairs
and
see
that
he
does
not
kill
himself
said
grandet
now
then
he
added
looking
at
his
wife
and
daughter
who
had
turned
pale
at
his
words
no
nonsense
you
two
i
must
leave
you
i
have
got
to
see
about
the
dutchmen
who
are
going
away
and
then
i
must
find
cruchot
and
talk
with
him
about
all
he
departed
as
soon
as
he
had
shut
the
door
eugenie
and
her
mother
breathed
more
freely
until
this
morning
the
young
girl
had
never
felt
constrained
in
the
presence
of
her
father
but
for
the
last
few
hours
every
moment
wrought
a
change
in
her
feelings
and
ideas
mamma
how
many
louis
are
there
in
a
cask
of
wine
your
father
sells
his
from
a
hundred
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
francs
sometimes
two
hundred
at
least
so
i
ve
heard
then
papa
must
be
rich
perhaps
he
is
but
monsieur
cruchot
told
me
he
bought
froidfond
two
years
ago
that
may
have
pinched
eugenie
not
being
able
to
understand
the
question
of
her
father
s
fortune
stopped
short
in
her
calculations
he
didn
t
even
see
me
the
darling
said
nanon
coming
back
from
her
errand
he
s
stretched
out
like
a
calf
on
his
bed
and
crying
like
the
madeleine
and
that
s
a
blessing
what
s
the
matter
with
the
poor
dear
young
man
let
us
go
and
console
him
mamma
if
any
one
knocks
we
can
come
madame
grandet
was
helpless
against
the
sweet
persuasive
tones
of
her
daughter
s
voice
eugenie
was
sublime
she
had
become
a
woman
the
two
with
beating
hearts
went
up
to
charles
s
room
the
door
was
open
the
young
man
heard
and
saw
nothing
plunged
in
grief
he
only
uttered
inarticulate
cries
how
he
loves
his
father
said
eugenie
in
a
low
voice
in
the
utterance
of
those
words
it
was
impossible
to
mistake
the
hopes
of
a
heart
that
unknown
to
itself
had
suddenly
become
passionate
madame
grandet
cast
a
mother
s
look
upon
her
daughter
and
then
whispered
in
her
ear
take
care
you
will
love
him
love
him
answered
eugenie
ah
if
you
did
but
know
what
my
father
said
to
monsieur
charles
turned
over
and
saw
his
aunt
and
cousin
i
have
lost
my
father
my
poor
father
if
he
had
told
me
his
secret
troubles
we
might
have
worked
together
to
repair
them
my
god
my
poor
father
i
was
so
sure
i
should
see
him
again
that
i
think
i
kissed
him
quite
coldly
sobs
cut
short
the
words
we
will
pray
for
him
said
madame
grandet
resign
yourself
to
the
will
of
cousin
said
eugenie
take
courage
your
loss
is
irreparable
therefore
think
only
of
saving
your
with
the
delicate
instinct
of
a
woman
who
intuitively
puts
her
mind
into
all
things
even
at
the
moment
when
she
offers
consolation
eugenie
sought
to
cheat
her
cousin
s
grief
by
turning
his
thoughts
inward
upon
himself
my
honor
exclaimed
the
young
man
tossing
aside
his
hair
with
an
impatient
gesture
as
he
sat
up
on
his
bed
and
crossed
his
arms
ah
that
is
true
my
uncle
said
my
father
had
he
uttered
a
cry
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
leave
me
leave
me
cousin
my
god
my
god
forgive
my
father
for
he
must
have
suffered
sorely
there
was
something
terribly
attractive
in
the
sight
of
this
young
sorrow
sincere
without
reasoning
or
afterthought
it
was
a
virgin
grief
which
the
simple
hearts
of
eugenie
and
her
mother
were
fitted
to
comprehend
and
they
obeyed
the
sign
charles
made
them
to
leave
him
to
himself
they
went
downstairs
in
silence
and
took
their
accustomed
places
by
the
window
and
sewed
for
nearly
an
hour
without
exchanging
a
word
eugenie
had
seen
in
the
furtive
glance
that
she
cast
about
the
young
man
s
room
that
girlish
glance
which
sees
all
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
pretty
trifles
of
his
his
scissors
his
razors
embossed
with
gold
this
gleam
of
luxury
across
her
cousin
s
grief
only
made
him
the
more
interesting
to
her
possibly
by
way
of
contrast
never
before
had
so
serious
an
event
so
dramatic
a
sight
touched
the
imaginations
of
these
two
passive
beings
hitherto
sunk
in
the
stillness
and
calm
of
solitude
mamma
said
eugenie
we
must
wear
mourning
for
my
your
father
will
decide
that
answered
madame
grandet
they
relapsed
into
silence
eugenie
drew
her
stitches
with
a
uniform
motion
which
revealed
to
an
observer
the
teeming
thoughts
of
her
meditation
the
first
desire
of
the
girl
s
heart
was
to
share
her
cousin
s
mourning
vi
about
four
o
clock
an
abrupt
knock
at
the
door
struck
sharply
on
the
heart
of
madame
grandet
what
can
have
happened
to
your
father
she
said
to
her
daughter
grandet
entered
joyously
after
taking
off
his
gloves
he
rubbed
his
hands
hard
enough
to
take
off
their
skin
as
well
if
his
epidermis
had
not
been
tanned
and
cured
like
russia
leather
saving
of
course
the
perfume
of
and
incense
presently
his
secret
escaped
him
wife
he
said
without
stuttering
i
ve
trapped
them
all
our
wine
is
sold
the
dutch
and
the
belgians
have
gone
i
walked
about
the
in
front
of
their
inn
pretending
to
be
doing
nothing
that
belgian
fellow
you
know
who
i
mean
came
up
to
me
the
owners
of
all
the
good
vineyards
have
kept
back
their
vintages
intending
to
wait
well
i
didn
t
hinder
them
the
belgian
was
in
despair
i
saw
that
in
a
minute
the
bargain
was
made
he
takes
my
vintage
at
two
hundred
francs
the
puncheon
half
down
he
paid
me
in
gold
the
notes
are
drawn
here
are
six
louis
for
you
in
three
months
wines
will
have
these
words
uttered
in
a
quiet
tone
of
voice
were
nevertheless
so
bitterly
sarcastic
that
the
inhabitants
of
saumur
grouped
at
this
moment
in
the
and
overwhelmed
by
the
news
of
the
sale
grandet
had
just
effected
would
have
shuddered
had
they
heard
them
their
panic
would
have
brought
the
price
of
wines
down
fifty
per
cent
at
once
did
you
have
a
thousand
puncheons
this
year
father
yes
little
that
term
applied
to
his
daughter
was
the
superlative
expression
of
the
old
miser
s
joy
then
that
makes
two
hundred
thousand
pieces
of
twenty
sous
each
yes
mademoiselle
then
father
you
can
easily
help
the
amazement
the
anger
the
stupefaction
of
belshazzar
when
he
saw
the
before
his
eyes
is
not
to
be
compared
with
the
cold
rage
of
grandet
who
having
forgotten
his
nephew
now
found
him
enshrined
in
the
heart
and
calculations
of
his
daughter
what
s
this
ever
since
that
dandy
put
foot
in
house
everything
goes
wrong
you
behave
as
if
you
had
the
right
to
buy
and
make
feasts
and
weddings
i
won
t
have
that
sort
of
thing
i
hope
i
know
my
duty
at
my
time
of
life
i
certainly
sha
n
t
take
lessons
from
my
daughter
or
from
anybody
else
i
shall
do
for
my
nephew
what
it
is
proper
to
do
and
you
have
no
need
to
poke
your
nose
into
it
as
for
you
eugenie
he
added
facing
her
don
t
speak
of
this
again
or
i
ll
send
you
to
the
abbaye
des
noyers
with
nanon
see
if
i
don
t
and
no
later
than
either
if
you
disobey
me
where
is
that
fellow
has
he
come
down
yet
no
my
friend
answered
madame
grandet
what
is
he
doing
then
he
is
weeping
for
his
father
said
eugenie
grandet
looked
at
his
daughter
without
finding
a
word
to
say
after
all
he
was
a
father
he
made
a
couple
of
turns
up
and
down
the
room
and
then
went
hurriedly
to
his
secret
den
to
think
over
an
investment
he
was
meditating
in
the
public
funds
the
thinning
out
of
his
two
thousand
acres
of
forest
land
had
yielded
him
six
hundred
thousand
francs
putting
this
sum
to
that
derived
from
the
sale
of
his
poplars
and
to
his
other
gains
for
the
last
year
and
for
the
current
year
he
had
amassed
a
total
of
nine
hundred
thousand
francs
without
counting
the
two
hundred
thousand
he
had
got
by
the
sale
just
concluded
the
twenty
per
cent
which
cruchot
assured
him
would
gain
in
a
short
time
from
the
funds
then
quoted
at
seventy
tempted
him
he
figured
out
his
calculation
on
the
margin
of
the
newspaper
which
gave
the
account
of
his
brother
s
death
all
the
while
hearing
the
moans
of
his
nephew
but
without
listening
to
them
nanon
came
and
knocked
on
the
wall
to
summon
him
to
dinner
on
the
last
step
of
the
staircase
he
was
saying
to
himself
as
he
came
down
i
ll
do
it
i
shall
get
eight
per
cent
interest
in
two
years
i
shall
have
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
which
i
will
then
draw
out
in
good
gold
well
where
s
my
nephew
he
says
he
doesn
t
want
anything
to
eat
answered
nanon
that
s
not
good
for
so
much
saved
retorted
her
master
that
s
so
she
said
bah
he
won
t
cry
long
hunger
drives
the
wolves
out
of
the
the
dinner
was
eaten
in
silence
my
good
friend
said
madame
grandet
when
the
cloth
was
removed
we
must
put
on
upon
my
word
madame
grandet
what
will
you
invent
next
to
spend
money
on
mourning
is
in
the
heart
and
not
in
the
but
mourning
for
a
brother
is
indispensable
and
the
church
commands
us
to
buy
your
mourning
out
of
your
six
louis
give
me
a
that
s
enough
for
eugenie
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
without
uttering
a
word
her
generous
instincts
slumbering
and
long
repressed
but
now
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
awakened
were
galled
at
every
turn
the
evening
passed
to
all
appearance
like
a
thousand
other
evenings
of
their
monotonous
life
yet
it
was
certainly
the
most
horrible
eugenie
sewed
without
raising
her
head
and
did
not
use
the
workbox
which
charles
had
despised
the
night
before
madame
grandet
knitted
her
sleeves
grandet
twirled
his
thumbs
for
four
hours
absorbed
in
calculations
whose
results
were
on
the
morrow
to
astonish
saumur
no
one
came
to
visit
the
family
that
day
the
whole
town
was
ringing
with
the
news
of
the
business
trick
just
played
by
grandet
the
failure
of
his
brother
and
the
arrival
of
his
nephew
obeying
the
desire
to
gossip
over
their
mutual
interests
all
the
upper
and
in
saumur
met
at
monsieur
des
grassins
where
terrible
imprecations
were
being
fulminated
against
the
nanon
was
spinning
and
the
whirr
of
her
wheel
was
the
only
sound
heard
beneath
the
gray
rafters
of
that
silent
hall
we
don
t
waste
our
tongues
she
said
showing
her
teeth
as
large
and
white
as
peeled
almonds
nothing
should
be
wasted
answered
grandet
rousing
himself
from
his
reverie
he
saw
a
perspective
of
eight
millions
in
three
years
and
he
was
sailing
along
that
sheet
of
gold
let
us
go
to
bed
i
will
bid
my
nephew
for
the
rest
of
you
and
see
if
he
will
take
madame
grandet
remained
on
the
landing
of
the
first
storey
to
hear
the
conversation
that
was
about
to
take
place
between
the
goodman
and
his
nephew
eugenie
bolder
than
her
mother
went
up
two
stairs
well
nephew
you
are
in
trouble
yes
weep
that
s
natural
a
father
is
a
father
but
we
must
bear
our
troubles
patiently
i
am
a
good
uncle
to
you
remember
that
come
take
courage
will
you
have
a
little
glass
of
wine
wine
costs
nothing
in
saumur
and
they
offer
it
as
tea
is
offered
in
china
why
added
grandet
you
have
got
no
light
that
s
bad
very
bad
you
ought
to
see
what
you
are
about
and
he
walked
to
the
what
s
this
he
cried
a
wax
candle
how
the
devil
did
they
filch
a
wax
candle
the
spendthrifts
would
tear
down
the
ceilings
of
my
house
to
boil
the
fellow
s
hearing
these
words
mother
and
daughter
slipped
back
into
their
rooms
and
burrowed
in
their
beds
with
the
celerity
of
frightened
mice
getting
back
to
their
holes
madame
grandet
have
you
found
a
mine
said
the
man
coming
into
the
chamber
of
his
wife
my
friend
wait
i
am
saying
my
prayers
said
the
poor
mother
in
a
trembling
voice
the
devil
take
your
good
god
growled
grandet
in
reply
misers
have
no
belief
in
a
future
life
the
present
is
their
all
in
all
this
thought
casts
a
terrible
light
upon
our
present
epoch
in
which
far
more
than
at
any
former
period
money
sways
the
laws
and
politics
and
morals
institutions
books
men
and
dogmas
all
conspire
to
undermine
belief
in
a
future
life
a
belief
upon
which
the
social
edifice
has
rested
for
eighteen
hundred
years
the
grave
as
a
means
of
transition
is
little
feared
in
our
day
the
future
which
once
opened
to
us
beyond
the
requiems
has
now
been
imported
into
the
present
to
obtain
fas
et
a
terrestrial
paradise
of
luxury
and
earthly
enjoyment
to
harden
the
heart
and
macerate
the
body
for
the
sake
of
fleeting
possessions
as
the
martyrs
once
suffered
all
things
to
reach
eternal
joys
this
is
now
the
universal
thought
a
thought
written
everywhere
even
in
the
very
laws
which
ask
of
the
legislator
what
do
you
pay
instead
of
asking
him
what
do
you
think
when
this
doctrine
has
passed
down
from
the
bourgeoisie
to
the
populace
where
will
this
country
be
madame
grandet
have
you
done
asked
the
old
man
my
friend
i
am
praying
for
very
good
morning
we
will
have
a
the
poor
woman
went
to
sleep
like
a
schoolboy
who
not
having
learned
his
lessons
knows
he
will
see
his
master
s
angry
face
on
the
morrow
at
the
moment
when
filled
with
fear
she
was
drawing
the
sheet
above
her
head
that
she
might
stifle
hearing
eugenie
in
her
and
with
naked
feet
ran
to
her
side
and
kissed
her
brow
oh
my
good
mother
she
said
i
will
tell
him
it
was
no
he
would
send
you
to
noyers
leave
me
to
manage
it
he
can
not
eat
do
you
hear
mamma
what
is
weeping
go
to
bed
my
daughter
you
will
take
cold
in
your
feet
the
floor
is
thus
passed
the
solemn
day
which
was
destined
to
weight
upon
the
whole
life
of
the
rich
and
poor
heiress
whose
sleep
was
never
again
to
be
so
calm
nor
yet
so
pure
as
it
had
been
up
to
this
moment
it
often
happens
that
certain
actions
of
human
life
seem
literally
speaking
improbable
though
actual
is
not
this
because
we
constantly
omit
to
turn
the
stream
of
psychological
light
upon
our
impulsive
determinations
and
fail
to
explain
the
subtile
reasons
mysteriously
conceived
in
our
minds
which
impelled
them
perhaps
eugenie
s
deep
passion
should
be
analyzed
in
its
most
delicate
fibres
for
it
became
scoffers
might
say
a
malady
which
influenced
her
whole
existence
many
people
prefer
to
deny
results
rather
than
estimate
the
force
of
ties
and
links
and
bonds
which
secretly
join
one
fact
to
another
in
the
moral
order
here
therefore
eugenie
s
past
life
will
offer
to
observers
of
human
nature
an
explanation
of
her
naive
want
of
reflection
and
the
suddenness
of
the
emotions
which
overflowed
her
soul
the
more
tranquil
her
life
had
been
the
more
vivid
was
her
womanly
pity
the
more
were
the
sentiments
now
developed
in
her
soul
made
restless
by
the
events
of
the
day
she
woke
at
intervals
to
listen
to
her
cousin
thinking
she
heard
the
sighs
which
still
echoed
in
her
heart
sometimes
she
saw
him
dying
of
his
trouble
sometimes
she
dreamed
that
he
fainted
from
hunger
towards
morning
she
was
certain
that
she
heard
a
startling
cry
she
dressed
at
once
and
ran
in
the
dawning
light
with
a
swift
foot
to
her
cousin
s
chamber
the
door
of
which
he
had
left
open
the
candle
had
burned
down
to
the
socket
charles
overcome
by
nature
was
sleeping
dressed
and
sitting
in
an
armchair
beside
the
bed
on
which
his
head
rested
he
dreamed
as
men
dream
on
an
empty
stomach
eugenie
might
weep
at
her
ease
she
might
admire
the
young
and
handsome
face
blotted
with
grief
the
eyes
swollen
with
weeping
that
seemed
sleeping
as
they
were
to
well
forth
tears
charles
felt
sympathetically
the
young
girl
s
presence
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
her
pitying
him
pardon
me
my
cousin
he
said
evidently
not
knowing
the
hour
nor
the
place
in
which
he
found
himself
there
are
hearts
who
hear
you
cousin
and
thought
you
might
need
something
you
should
go
to
bed
you
tire
yourself
by
sitting
that
is
well
then
adieu
she
escaped
ashamed
and
happy
at
having
gone
there
innocence
alone
can
dare
to
be
so
bold
once
enlightened
virtue
makes
her
calculations
as
well
as
vice
eugenie
who
had
not
trembled
beside
her
cousin
could
scarcely
stand
upon
her
legs
when
she
regained
her
chamber
her
ignorant
life
had
suddenly
come
to
an
end
she
reasoned
she
rebuked
herself
with
many
reproaches
what
will
he
think
of
me
he
will
think
that
i
love
him
that
was
what
she
most
wished
him
to
think
an
honest
love
has
its
own
prescience
and
knows
that
love
begets
love
what
an
event
for
this
poor
solitary
girl
thus
to
have
entered
the
chamber
of
a
young
man
are
there
not
thoughts
and
actions
in
the
life
of
love
which
to
certain
souls
bear
the
full
meaning
of
the
holiest
espousals
an
hour
later
she
went
to
her
mother
and
dressed
her
as
usual
then
they
both
came
down
and
sat
in
their
places
before
the
window
waiting
for
grandet
with
that
cruel
anxiety
which
according
to
the
individual
character
freezes
the
heart
or
warms
it
shrivels
or
dilates
it
when
a
scene
is
feared
a
punishment
expected
a
feeling
so
natural
that
even
domestic
animals
possess
it
and
whine
at
the
slightest
pain
of
punishment
though
they
make
no
outcry
when
they
inadvertently
hurt
themselves
the
goodman
came
down
but
he
spoke
to
his
wife
with
an
absent
manner
kissed
eugenie
and
sat
down
to
table
without
appearing
to
remember
his
threats
of
the
night
before
what
has
become
of
my
nephew
the
lad
gives
no
monsieur
he
is
asleep
answered
nanon
so
much
the
better
he
won
t
want
a
wax
candle
said
grandet
in
a
jeering
tone
this
unusual
clemency
this
bitter
gaiety
struck
madame
grandet
with
amazement
and
she
looked
at
her
husband
attentively
the
goodman
here
it
may
be
well
to
explain
that
in
touraine
anjou
pitou
and
bretagne
the
word
goodman
already
used
to
designate
grandet
is
bestowed
as
often
upon
harsh
and
cruel
men
as
upon
those
of
kindly
temperament
when
either
have
reached
a
certain
age
the
title
means
nothing
on
the
score
of
individual
gentleness
the
goodman
took
his
hat
and
gloves
saying
as
he
went
out
i
am
going
to
loiter
about
the
and
find
eugenie
your
father
certainly
has
something
on
his
grandet
who
was
a
poor
sleeper
employed
half
his
nights
in
the
preliminary
calculations
which
gave
such
astonishing
accuracy
to
his
views
and
observations
and
schemes
and
secured
to
them
the
unfailing
success
at
sight
of
which
his
townsmen
stood
amazed
all
human
power
is
a
compound
of
time
and
patience
powerful
beings
will
and
wait
the
life
of
a
miser
is
the
constant
exercise
of
human
power
put
to
the
service
of
self
it
rests
on
two
sentiments
only
and
but
being
to
a
certain
extent
compact
and
intelligent
the
visible
sign
of
real
superiority
it
follows
that
and
are
two
parts
of
the
same
whole
egotism
from
this
arises
perhaps
the
excessive
curiosity
shown
in
the
habits
of
a
miser
s
life
whenever
they
are
put
before
the
world
every
nature
holds
by
a
thread
to
those
beings
who
challenge
all
human
sentiments
by
concentrating
all
in
one
passion
where
is
the
man
without
desire
and
what
social
desire
can
be
satisfied
without
money
grandet
unquestionably
had
something
on
his
mind
to
use
his
wife
s
expression
there
was
in
him
as
in
all
misers
a
persistent
craving
to
play
a
commercial
game
with
other
men
and
win
their
money
legally
to
impose
upon
other
people
was
to
him
a
sign
of
power
a
perpetual
proof
that
he
had
won
the
right
to
despise
those
feeble
beings
who
suffer
themselves
to
be
preyed
upon
in
this
world
oh
who
has
ever
truly
understood
the
lamb
lying
peacefully
at
the
feet
of
god
touching
emblem
of
all
terrestrial
victims
myth
of
their
future
suffering
and
weakness
glorified
this
lamb
it
is
which
the
miser
fattens
puts
in
his
fold
slaughters
cooks
eats
and
then
despises
the
pasture
of
misers
is
compounded
of
money
and
disdain
during
the
night
grandet
s
ideas
had
taken
another
course
which
was
the
reason
of
his
sudden
clemency
he
had
hatched
a
plot
by
which
to
trick
the
parisians
to
decoy
and
dupe
and
snare
them
to
drive
them
into
a
trap
and
make
them
go
and
come
and
sweat
and
hope
and
turn
pale
a
plot
by
which
to
amuse
himself
the
old
provincial
cooper
sitting
there
beneath
his
gloomy
rafters
or
passing
up
and
down
the
rotten
staircase
of
his
house
in
saumur
his
nephew
filled
his
mind
he
wished
to
save
the
honor
of
his
dead
brother
without
the
cost
of
a
penny
to
the
son
or
to
himself
his
own
funds
he
was
about
to
invest
for
three
years
he
had
therefore
nothing
further
to
do
than
to
manage
his
property
in
saumur
he
needed
some
nutriment
for
his
malicious
activity
and
he
found
it
suddenly
in
his
brother
s
failure
feeling
nothing
to
squeeze
between
his
own
paws
he
resolved
to
crush
the
parisians
in
behalf
of
charles
and
to
play
the
part
of
a
good
brother
on
the
cheapest
terms
the
honor
of
the
family
counted
for
so
little
in
this
scheme
that
his
good
intentions
might
be
likened
to
the
interest
a
gambler
takes
in
seeing
a
game
well
played
in
which
he
has
no
stake
the
cruchots
were
a
necessary
part
of
his
plan
but
he
would
not
seek
them
he
resolved
to
make
them
come
to
him
and
to
lead
up
that
very
evening
to
a
comedy
whose
plot
he
had
just
conceived
which
should
make
him
on
the
morrow
an
object
of
admiration
to
the
whole
town
without
its
costing
him
a
single
penny
in
her
father
s
absence
eugenie
had
the
happiness
of
busying
herself
openly
with
her
cousin
of
spending
upon
him
fearlessly
the
treasures
of
her
pity
woman
s
sublime
superiority
the
sole
she
desires
to
have
recognized
the
sole
she
pardons
man
for
letting
her
assume
three
or
four
times
the
young
girl
went
to
listen
to
her
cousin
s
breathing
to
know
if
he
were
sleeping
or
awake
then
when
he
had
risen
she
turned
her
thoughts
to
the
cream
the
eggs
the
fruits
the
plates
the
glasses
all
that
was
a
part
of
his
breakfast
became
the
object
of
some
special
care
at
length
she
ran
lightly
up
the
old
staircase
to
listen
to
the
noise
her
cousin
made
was
he
dressing
did
he
still
weep
she
reached
the
door
my
cousin
yes
will
you
breakfast
downstairs
or
in
your
room
where
you
how
do
you
feel
dear
cousin
i
am
ashamed
of
being
this
conversation
held
through
the
closed
door
was
like
an
episode
in
a
poem
to
eugenie
well
then
we
will
bring
your
breakfast
to
your
own
room
so
as
not
to
annoy
my
she
ran
to
the
kitchen
with
the
swiftness
and
lightness
of
a
bird
nanon
go
and
do
his
room
that
staircase
so
often
traversed
which
echoed
to
the
slightest
noise
now
lost
its
decaying
aspect
in
the
eyes
of
eugenie
it
grew
luminous
it
had
a
voice
and
spoke
to
her
it
was
young
like
herself
young
like
the
love
it
was
now
serving
her
mother
her
kind
indulgent
mother
lent
herself
to
the
caprices
of
the
child
s
love
and
after
the
room
was
put
in
order
both
went
to
sit
with
the
unhappy
youth
and
keep
him
company
does
not
christian
charity
make
consolation
a
duty
the
two
women
drew
a
goodly
number
of
little
sophistries
from
their
religion
wherewith
to
justify
their
conduct
charles
was
made
the
object
of
the
tenderest
and
most
loving
care
his
saddened
heart
felt
the
sweetness
of
the
gentle
friendship
the
exquisite
sympathy
which
these
two
souls
crushed
under
perpetual
restraint
knew
so
well
how
to
display
when
for
an
instant
they
were
left
unfettered
in
the
regions
of
suffering
their
natural
sphere
claiming
the
right
of
relationship
eugenie
began
to
fold
the
linen
and
put
in
order
the
toilet
articles
which
charles
had
brought
thus
she
could
marvel
at
her
ease
over
each
luxurious
bauble
and
the
various
of
silver
or
chased
gold
which
she
held
long
in
her
hand
under
a
pretext
of
examining
them
charles
could
not
see
without
emotion
the
generous
interest
his
aunt
and
cousin
felt
in
him
he
knew
society
in
paris
well
enough
to
feel
assured
that
placed
as
he
now
was
he
would
find
all
hearts
indifferent
or
cold
eugenie
thus
appeared
to
him
in
the
splendor
of
a
special
beauty
and
from
thenceforth
he
admired
the
innocence
of
life
and
manners
which
the
previous
evening
he
had
been
inclined
to
ridicule
so
when
eugenie
took
from
nanon
the
bowl
of
coffee
and
cream
and
began
to
pour
it
out
for
her
cousin
with
the
simplicity
of
real
feeling
giving
him
a
kindly
glance
the
eyes
of
the
parisian
filled
with
tears
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
what
troubles
you
she
said
oh
these
are
tears
of
gratitude
he
answered
eugenie
turned
abruptly
to
the
to
take
the
candlesticks
here
nanon
carry
them
away
she
said
when
she
looked
again
towards
her
cousin
she
was
still
blushing
but
her
looks
could
at
least
deceive
and
did
not
betray
the
excess
of
joy
which
innundated
her
heart
yet
the
eyes
of
both
expressed
the
same
sentiment
as
their
souls
flowed
together
in
one
thought
the
future
was
theirs
this
soft
emotion
was
all
the
more
precious
to
charles
in
the
midst
of
his
heavy
grief
because
it
was
wholly
unexpected
the
sound
of
the
knocker
recalled
the
women
to
their
usual
station
happily
they
were
able
to
run
downstairs
with
sufficient
rapidity
to
be
seated
at
their
work
when
grandet
entered
had
he
met
them
under
the
archway
it
would
have
been
enough
to
rouse
his
suspicions
after
breakfast
which
the
goodman
took
standing
the
keeper
from
froidfond
to
whom
the
promised
indemnity
had
never
yet
been
paid
made
his
appearance
bearing
a
hare
and
some
partridges
shot
in
the
park
with
eels
and
two
pike
sent
as
tribute
by
the
millers
ha
ha
poor
cornoiller
here
he
comes
like
fish
in
lent
is
all
that
fit
to
eat
yes
my
dear
generous
master
it
has
been
killed
two
come
nanon
bestir
yourself
said
grandet
take
these
things
they
ll
do
for
dinner
i
have
invited
the
two
nanon
opened
her
eyes
stupid
with
amazement
and
looked
at
everybody
in
the
room
well
she
said
and
how
am
i
to
get
the
lard
and
the
spices
wife
said
grandet
give
nanon
six
francs
and
remind
me
to
get
some
of
the
good
wine
out
of
the
well
then
monsieur
grandet
said
the
keeper
who
had
come
prepared
with
an
harangue
for
the
purpose
of
settling
the
question
of
the
indemnity
monsieur
grandet
ta
ta
ta
ta
said
grandet
i
know
what
you
want
to
say
you
are
a
good
fellow
we
will
see
about
it
i
m
too
busy
wife
give
him
five
francs
he
added
to
madame
grandet
as
he
decamped
the
poor
woman
was
only
too
happy
to
buy
peace
at
the
cost
of
eleven
francs
she
knew
that
grandet
would
let
her
alone
for
a
fortnight
after
he
had
thus
taken
back
franc
by
franc
the
money
he
had
given
her
here
cornoiller
she
said
slipping
ten
francs
into
the
man
s
hand
some
day
we
will
reward
your
cornoiller
could
say
nothing
so
he
went
away
madame
said
nanon
who
had
put
on
her
black
coif
and
taken
her
basket
i
want
only
three
francs
you
keep
the
rest
it
ll
go
fast
enough
have
a
good
dinner
nanon
my
cousin
will
come
down
said
eugenie
something
very
extraordinary
is
going
on
i
am
certain
of
it
said
madame
grandet
this
is
only
the
third
time
since
our
marriage
that
your
father
has
given
a
about
four
o
clock
just
as
eugenie
and
her
mother
had
finished
setting
the
table
for
six
persons
and
after
the
master
of
the
house
had
brought
up
a
few
bottles
of
the
exquisite
wine
which
provincials
cherish
with
true
affection
charles
came
down
into
the
hall
the
young
fellow
was
pale
his
gestures
the
expression
of
his
face
his
glance
and
the
tones
of
his
voice
all
had
a
sadness
which
was
full
of
grace
he
was
not
pretending
grief
he
truly
suffered
and
the
veil
of
pain
cast
over
his
features
gave
him
an
interesting
air
dear
to
the
heart
of
women
eugenie
loved
him
the
more
for
it
perhaps
she
felt
that
sorrow
drew
him
nearer
to
her
charles
was
no
longer
the
rich
and
distinguished
young
man
placed
in
a
sphere
far
above
her
but
a
relation
plunged
into
frightful
misery
misery
begets
equality
women
have
this
in
common
with
the
angels
suffering
humanity
belongs
to
them
charles
and
eugenie
understood
each
other
and
spoke
only
with
their
eyes
for
the
poor
fallen
dandy
orphaned
and
impoverished
sat
apart
in
a
corner
of
the
room
and
was
proudly
calm
and
silent
yet
from
time
to
time
the
gentle
and
caressing
glance
of
the
young
girl
shone
upon
him
and
constrained
him
away
from
his
sad
thoughts
drawing
him
with
her
into
the
fields
of
hope
and
of
futurity
where
she
loved
to
hold
him
at
her
side
vii
at
this
moment
the
town
of
saumur
was
more
excited
about
the
dinner
given
by
grandet
to
the
cruchots
than
it
had
been
the
night
before
at
the
sale
of
his
vintage
though
that
constituted
a
crime
of
against
the
whole
community
if
the
politic
old
miser
had
given
his
dinner
from
the
same
idea
that
cost
the
dog
of
alcibiades
his
tail
he
might
perhaps
have
been
called
a
great
man
but
the
fact
is
considering
himself
superior
to
a
community
which
he
could
trick
on
all
occasions
he
paid
very
little
heed
to
what
saumur
might
say
the
des
grassins
soon
learned
the
facts
of
the
failure
and
the
violent
death
of
guillaume
grandet
and
they
determined
to
go
to
their
client
s
house
that
very
evening
to
commiserate
his
misfortune
and
show
him
some
marks
of
friendship
with
a
view
of
ascertaining
the
motives
which
had
led
him
to
invite
the
cruchots
to
dinner
at
precisely
five
o
clock
monsieur
de
bonfons
and
his
uncle
the
notary
arrived
in
their
sunday
clothes
the
party
sat
down
to
table
and
began
to
dine
with
good
appetites
grandet
was
grave
charles
silent
eugenie
dumb
and
madame
grandet
did
not
say
more
than
usual
so
that
the
dinner
was
very
properly
a
repast
of
condolence
when
they
rose
from
table
charles
said
to
his
aunt
and
uncle
will
you
permit
me
to
retire
i
am
obliged
to
undertake
a
long
and
painful
certainly
as
soon
as
the
goodman
was
certain
that
charles
could
hear
nothing
and
was
probably
deep
in
his
he
said
with
a
dissimulating
glance
at
his
wife
madame
grandet
what
we
have
to
talk
about
will
be
latin
to
you
it
is
seven
you
can
go
and
attend
to
your
household
accounts
my
he
kissed
eugenie
and
the
two
women
departed
a
scene
now
took
place
in
which
pere
grandet
brought
to
bear
more
than
at
any
other
moment
of
his
life
the
shrewd
dexterity
he
had
acquired
in
his
intercourse
with
men
and
which
had
won
him
from
those
whose
flesh
he
sometimes
bit
too
sharply
the
nickname
of
the
old
if
the
mayor
of
saumur
had
carried
his
ambition
higher
still
if
fortunate
circumstances
drawing
him
towards
the
higher
social
spheres
had
sent
him
into
congresses
where
the
affairs
of
nations
were
discussed
and
had
he
there
employed
the
genius
with
which
his
personal
interests
had
endowed
him
he
would
undoubtedly
have
proved
nobly
useful
to
his
native
land
yet
it
is
perhaps
equally
certain
that
outside
of
saumur
the
goodman
would
have
cut
a
very
sorry
figure
possibly
there
are
minds
like
certain
animals
which
cease
to
breed
when
transplanted
from
the
climates
in
which
they
are
born
le
you
said
the
stutter
which
for
years
the
old
miser
had
assumed
when
it
suited
him
and
which
together
with
the
deafness
of
which
he
sometimes
complained
in
rainy
weather
was
thought
in
saumur
to
be
a
natural
defect
became
at
this
crisis
so
wearisome
to
the
two
cruchots
that
while
they
listened
they
unconsciously
made
faces
and
moved
their
lips
as
if
pronouncing
the
words
over
which
he
was
hesitating
and
stuttering
at
will
here
it
may
be
well
to
give
the
history
of
this
impediment
of
the
speech
and
hearing
of
monsieur
grandet
no
one
in
anjou
heard
better
or
could
pronounce
more
crisply
the
french
language
with
an
angevin
accent
than
the
wily
old
cooper
some
years
earlier
in
spite
of
his
shrewdness
he
had
been
taken
in
by
an
israelite
who
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
held
his
hand
behind
his
ear
to
catch
sounds
and
mangled
his
meaning
so
thoroughly
in
trying
to
utter
his
words
that
grandet
fell
a
victim
to
his
humanity
and
was
compelled
to
prompt
the
wily
jew
with
the
words
and
ideas
he
seemed
to
seek
to
complete
himself
the
arguments
of
the
said
jew
to
say
what
that
cursed
jew
ought
to
have
said
for
himself
in
short
to
be
the
jew
instead
of
being
grandet
when
the
cooper
came
out
of
this
curious
encounter
he
had
concluded
the
only
bargain
of
which
in
the
course
of
a
long
commercial
life
he
ever
had
occasion
to
complain
but
if
he
lost
at
the
time
pecuniarily
he
gained
morally
a
valuable
lesson
later
he
gathered
its
fruits
indeed
the
goodman
ended
by
blessing
that
jew
for
having
taught
him
the
art
of
irritating
his
commercial
antagonist
and
leading
him
to
forget
his
own
thoughts
in
his
impatience
to
suggest
those
over
which
his
tormentor
was
stuttering
no
affair
had
ever
needed
the
assistance
of
deafness
impediments
of
speech
and
all
the
incomprehensible
circumlocutions
with
which
grandet
enveloped
his
ideas
as
much
as
the
affair
now
in
hand
in
the
first
place
he
did
not
mean
to
shoulder
the
responsibility
of
his
own
scheme
in
the
next
he
was
determined
to
remain
master
of
the
conversation
and
to
leave
his
real
intentions
in
doubt
de
for
the
second
time
in
three
years
grandet
called
the
cruchot
nephew
monsieur
de
bonfons
the
president
felt
he
might
consider
himself
the
artful
old
fellow
s
said
in
some
by
the
courts
of
commerce
themselves
it
is
done
constantly
said
monsieur
de
bonfons
bestriding
grandet
s
meaning
or
thinking
he
guessed
it
and
kindly
wishing
to
help
him
out
with
it
said
grandet
humbly
with
the
mischievous
expression
of
a
boy
who
is
inwardly
laughing
at
his
teacher
while
he
pays
him
the
greatest
attention
when
a
man
so
respected
and
important
as
for
example
your
late
brother
is
threatened
with
insolvency
they
it
yes
when
his
failure
is
imminent
the
court
of
commerce
to
which
he
is
amenable
please
follow
me
attentively
has
the
power
by
a
decree
to
appoint
a
receiver
liquidation
you
understand
is
not
the
same
as
failure
when
a
man
fails
he
is
dishonored
but
when
he
merely
liquidates
he
remains
an
honest
s
very
if
it
t
said
grandet
but
a
liquidation
can
be
managed
without
having
recourse
to
the
courts
at
all
for
said
the
president
sniffing
a
pinch
of
snuff
don
t
you
know
how
failures
are
declared
i
answered
grandet
in
the
first
place
resumed
the
magistrate
by
filing
the
schedule
in
the
record
office
of
the
court
which
the
merchant
may
do
himself
or
his
representative
for
him
with
a
power
of
attorney
duly
certified
in
the
second
place
the
failure
may
be
declared
under
compulsion
from
the
creditors
now
if
the
merchant
does
not
file
his
schedule
and
if
no
creditor
appears
before
the
courts
to
obtain
a
decree
of
insolvency
against
the
merchant
what
happens
why
the
family
of
the
deceased
his
representatives
his
heirs
or
the
merchant
himself
if
he
is
not
dead
or
his
friends
if
he
is
only
hiding
liquidate
his
business
perhaps
you
would
like
to
liquidate
your
brother
s
affairs
ah
grandet
said
the
notary
that
would
be
the
right
thing
to
do
there
is
honor
down
here
in
the
provinces
if
you
save
your
name
for
it
is
your
name
you
will
be
a
man
a
noble
man
cried
the
president
interrupting
his
uncle
certainly
answered
the
old
man
my
s
name
was
like
s
i
t
it
and
might
be
in
ways
the
interests
of
whom
i
but
i
must
consider
i
don
t
the
of
i
to
t
you
see
vines
my
in
short
i
ve
my
own
i
never
what
are
i
a
good
but
i
have
never
one
i
t
understand
such
things
i
have
say
that
be
of
course
said
the
president
notes
can
be
bought
in
the
market
less
so
much
per
cent
don
t
you
understand
grandet
made
an
of
his
hand
and
the
president
repeated
his
words
well
then
replied
the
man
there
s
to
be
out
of
it
i
at
my
age
about
such
i
here
and
after
the
the
vines
and
it
s
the
that
after
the
s
my
my
interests
are
at
froidfond
i
t
my
to
myself
with
a
i
about
you
say
i
ought
to
my
s
to
the
i
t
be
in
two
at
once
unless
i
were
a
little
and
i
understand
cried
the
notary
well
my
old
friend
you
have
friends
old
friends
capable
of
devoting
themselves
to
your
all
right
thought
grandet
make
haste
and
come
to
the
point
suppose
one
of
them
went
to
paris
and
saw
your
brother
guillaume
s
chief
creditor
and
said
to
him
one
interrupted
the
goodman
said
something
this
monsieur
of
saumur
this
monsieur
grandet
of
saumur
that
he
his
he
loves
his
grandet
is
a
uncle
he
well
he
has
sold
his
t
declare
a
a
meeting
and
then
will
see
what
he
do
liquidate
than
the
its
in
hein
isn
t
it
so
exactly
so
said
the
president
don
t
you
see
monsieur
de
a
man
must
he
if
you
t
you
t
know
all
about
the
all
the
resources
and
the
debts
if
you
t
want
to
be
hein
isn
t
it
so
certainly
said
the
president
i
m
of
opinion
that
in
a
few
months
the
debts
might
be
bought
up
for
a
certain
sum
and
then
paid
in
full
by
an
agreement
ha
ha
you
can
coax
a
dog
a
long
way
if
you
show
him
a
bit
of
lard
if
there
has
been
no
declaration
of
failure
and
you
hold
a
lien
on
the
debts
you
come
out
of
the
business
as
white
as
the
driven
said
grandet
putting
his
hand
to
his
ear
about
but
cried
the
president
do
pray
attend
to
what
i
am
i
am
a
note
is
merchandise
an
article
of
barter
which
rises
and
falls
in
prices
that
is
a
deduction
from
jeremy
bentham
s
theory
about
usury
that
writer
has
proved
that
the
prejudice
which
condemned
usurers
to
reprobation
was
mere
whew
ejaculated
the
goodman
allowing
that
money
according
to
bentham
is
an
article
of
merchandise
and
that
whatever
represents
money
is
equally
merchandise
resumed
the
president
allowing
also
that
it
is
notorious
that
the
commercial
note
bearing
this
or
that
signature
is
liable
to
the
fluctuation
of
all
commercial
values
rises
or
falls
in
the
market
is
dear
at
one
moment
and
is
worth
nothing
at
another
the
courts
decide
ah
how
stupid
i
am
i
beg
your
pardon
i
am
inclined
to
think
you
could
buy
up
your
brother
s
debts
for
per
you
him
bentham
an
that
s
a
jeremy
who
might
save
us
a
lot
of
lamentations
in
business
said
the
notary
laughing
those
englishmen
sense
said
grandet
so
to
if
my
s
are
worth
if
i
m
am
i
not
that
seems
to
my
the
would
be
no
would
not
be
i
let
me
explain
it
all
said
the
president
legally
if
you
acquire
a
title
to
all
the
debts
of
the
maison
grandet
your
brother
or
his
heirs
will
owe
nothing
to
any
one
very
very
repeated
grandet
in
equity
if
your
brother
s
notes
are
negotiated
negotiated
do
you
clearly
understand
the
term
negotiated
in
the
market
at
a
reduction
of
so
much
per
cent
in
value
and
if
one
of
your
friends
happening
to
be
present
should
buy
them
in
the
creditors
having
sold
them
of
their
own
without
constraint
the
estate
of
the
late
grandet
is
honorably
that
s
is
said
the
cooper
you
know
it
is
i
and
yes
but
you
need
not
undertake
it
i
am
quite
ready
to
go
to
paris
you
may
pay
my
expenses
they
will
only
be
a
trifle
i
will
see
the
creditors
and
talk
with
them
and
get
an
extension
of
time
and
everything
can
be
arranged
if
you
will
add
something
to
the
assets
so
as
to
buy
up
all
title
to
the
ll
see
about
i
t
and
i
t
bind
myself
without
he
who
t
can
t
don
t
you
see
that
s
very
i
m
all
by
what
you
ve
me
this
is
the
in
my
life
i
have
obliged
to
yes
you
are
not
a
i
m
only
a
and
know
about
you
have
just
me
i
about
very
good
said
the
president
preparing
to
resume
his
argument
nephew
said
the
notary
interrupting
him
in
a
warning
tone
well
what
uncle
answered
the
president
let
monsieur
grandet
explain
his
own
intentions
the
matter
in
question
is
of
the
first
importance
our
good
friend
ought
to
define
his
meaning
clearly
and
a
loud
knock
which
announced
the
arrival
of
the
des
grassins
family
succeeded
by
their
entrance
and
salutations
hindered
cruchot
from
concluding
his
sentence
the
notary
was
glad
of
the
interruption
for
grandet
was
beginning
to
look
suspiciously
at
him
and
the
wen
gave
signs
of
a
brewing
storm
in
the
first
place
the
notary
did
not
think
it
becoming
in
a
president
of
the
civil
courts
to
go
to
paris
and
manipulate
creditors
and
lend
himself
to
an
underhand
job
which
clashed
with
the
laws
of
strict
integrity
moreover
never
having
known
old
grandet
to
express
the
slightest
desire
to
pay
anything
no
matter
what
he
instinctively
feared
to
see
his
nephew
taking
part
in
the
affair
he
therefore
profited
by
the
entrance
of
the
des
grassins
to
take
the
nephew
by
the
arm
and
lead
him
into
the
embrasure
of
the
window
you
have
said
enough
nephew
you
ve
shown
enough
devotion
your
desire
to
win
the
girl
blinds
you
the
devil
you
mustn
t
go
at
it
tooth
and
nail
let
me
sail
the
ship
now
you
can
haul
on
the
braces
do
you
think
it
right
to
compromise
your
dignity
as
a
magistrate
in
such
a
he
stopped
for
he
heard
monsieur
des
grassins
saying
to
the
old
cooper
as
they
shook
hands
grandet
we
have
heard
of
the
frightful
misfortunes
which
have
just
befallen
your
family
the
failure
of
the
house
of
guillaume
grandet
and
the
death
of
your
brother
we
have
come
to
express
our
grief
at
these
sad
there
is
but
one
sad
event
said
the
notary
interrupting
the
banker
the
death
of
monsieur
grandet
junior
and
he
would
never
have
killed
himself
had
he
thought
in
time
of
applying
to
his
brother
for
help
our
old
friend
who
is
honorable
to
his
intends
to
liquidate
the
debts
of
the
maison
grandet
of
paris
to
save
him
the
worry
of
legal
proceedings
my
nephew
the
president
has
just
offered
to
go
to
paris
and
negotiate
with
the
creditors
for
a
satisfactory
these
words
corroborated
by
grandet
s
attitude
as
he
stood
silently
nursing
his
chin
astonished
the
three
des
grassins
who
had
been
leisurely
discussing
the
old
man
s
avarice
as
they
came
along
very
nearly
accusing
him
of
fratricide
ah
i
was
sure
of
it
cried
the
banker
looking
at
his
wife
what
did
i
tell
you
just
now
madame
des
grassins
grandet
is
honorable
to
the
backbone
and
would
never
allow
his
name
to
remain
under
the
slightest
cloud
money
without
honor
is
a
disease
there
is
honor
in
the
provinces
right
very
right
grandet
i
m
an
old
soldier
and
i
can
t
disguise
my
thoughts
i
speak
roughly
thunder
it
is
sublime
answered
the
goodman
as
the
banker
warmly
wrung
his
hand
but
this
my
dear
grandet
if
the
president
will
excuse
me
is
a
purely
commercial
matter
and
needs
a
consummate
business
man
your
agent
must
be
some
one
fully
acquainted
with
the
markets
with
disbursements
rebates
interest
calculations
and
so
forth
i
am
going
to
paris
on
business
of
my
own
and
i
can
take
charge
of
we
ll
see
about
to
it
us
under
the
without
to
anything
i
not
do
said
grandet
stuttering
because
you
see
monsieur
le
president
naturally
expects
me
to
pay
the
expenses
of
his
the
goodman
did
not
stammer
over
the
last
words
eh
cried
madame
des
grassins
why
it
is
a
pleasure
to
go
to
paris
i
would
willingly
pay
to
go
she
made
a
sign
to
her
husband
as
if
to
encourage
him
in
cutting
the
enemy
out
of
the
commission
que
then
she
glanced
ironically
at
the
two
cruchots
who
looked
grandet
seized
the
banker
by
a
button
and
drew
him
into
a
corner
of
the
room
i
have
a
great
deal
more
confidence
in
you
than
in
the
president
he
said
besides
i
ve
other
fish
to
fry
he
added
wriggling
his
wen
i
want
to
buy
a
few
thousand
francs
in
the
funds
while
they
are
at
eighty
they
fall
i
m
told
at
the
end
of
each
month
you
know
all
about
these
things
don
t
you
bless
me
then
am
i
to
invest
enough
to
give
you
a
few
thousand
francs
a
year
that
s
not
much
to
begin
with
hush
i
don
t
want
any
one
to
know
i
am
going
to
play
that
game
you
can
make
the
investment
by
the
end
of
the
month
say
nothing
to
the
cruchots
that
ll
annoy
them
if
you
are
really
going
to
paris
we
will
see
if
there
is
anything
to
be
done
for
my
poor
well
it
s
all
settled
i
ll
start
by
the
said
des
grassins
aloud
and
i
will
come
and
take
your
last
directions
at
what
hour
will
suit
you
five
o
clock
just
before
dinner
said
grandet
rubbing
his
hands
the
two
parties
stayed
on
for
a
short
time
des
grassins
said
after
a
pause
striking
grandet
on
the
shoulder
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
relation
like
yes
yes
without
making
a
show
said
grandet
i
am
a
relation
i
loved
my
brother
and
i
will
prove
it
unless
it
we
must
leave
you
grandet
said
the
banker
interrupting
him
fortunately
before
he
got
to
the
end
of
his
sentence
if
i
hurry
my
departure
i
must
attend
to
some
matters
at
very
good
very
good
i
myself
in
of
what
i
you
i
must
retire
to
my
own
room
and
as
president
cruchot
plague
take
him
i
am
no
longer
monsieur
de
bonfons
thought
the
magistrate
ruefully
his
face
assuming
the
expression
of
a
judge
bored
by
an
argument
the
heads
of
the
two
factions
walked
off
together
neither
gave
any
further
thought
to
the
treachery
grandet
had
been
guilty
of
in
the
morning
against
the
whole
community
each
tried
to
fathom
what
the
other
was
thinking
about
the
real
intentions
of
the
wily
old
man
in
this
new
affair
but
in
vain
will
you
go
with
us
to
madame
dorsonval
s
said
des
grassins
to
the
notary
we
will
go
there
later
answered
the
president
i
have
promised
to
say
to
mademoiselle
de
gribeaucourt
and
we
will
go
there
first
if
my
uncle
is
farewell
for
the
present
said
madame
des
grassins
when
the
cruchots
were
a
few
steps
off
adolphe
remarked
to
his
father
are
not
they
fuming
hein
hold
your
tongue
my
son
said
his
mother
they
might
hear
you
besides
what
you
say
is
not
in
good
taste
well
uncle
cried
the
president
when
he
saw
the
des
grassins
disappearing
i
began
by
being
de
bonfons
and
i
have
ended
as
nothing
but
i
saw
that
that
annoyed
you
but
the
wind
has
set
fair
for
the
des
grassins
what
a
fool
you
are
with
all
your
cleverness
let
them
sail
off
on
grandet
s
we
ll
see
about
it
and
keep
yourself
quiet
young
man
eugenie
will
none
the
less
be
your
in
a
few
moments
the
news
of
grandet
s
magnanimous
resolve
was
disseminated
in
three
houses
at
the
same
moment
and
the
whole
town
began
to
talk
of
his
fraternal
devotion
every
one
forgave
grandet
for
the
sale
made
in
defiance
of
the
good
faith
pledged
to
the
community
they
admired
his
sense
of
honor
and
began
to
laud
a
generosity
of
which
they
had
never
thought
him
capable
it
is
part
of
the
french
nature
to
grow
enthusiastic
or
angry
or
fervent
about
some
meteor
of
the
moment
can
it
be
that
collective
beings
nationalities
peoples
are
devoid
of
memory
when
pere
grandet
had
shut
the
door
he
called
nanon
don
t
let
the
dog
loose
and
don
t
go
to
bed
we
have
work
to
do
together
at
eleven
o
clock
cornoiller
will
be
at
the
door
with
the
chariot
from

listen
for
him
and
prevent
his
knocking
tell
him
to
come
in
softly
police
regulations
don
t
allow
nocturnal
racket
besides
the
whole
neighborhood
need
not
know
that
i
am
starting
on
a
so
saying
grandet
returned
to
his
private
room
where
nanon
heard
him
moving
about
rummaging
and
walking
to
and
fro
though
with
much
precaution
for
he
evidently
did
not
wish
to
wake
his
wife
and
daughter
and
above
all
not
to
rouse
the
attention
of
his
nephew
whom
he
had
begun
to
anathematize
when
he
saw
a
thread
of
light
under
his
door
about
the
middle
of
the
night
eugenie
intent
on
her
cousin
fancied
she
heard
a
cry
like
that
of
a
dying
person
it
must
be
charles
she
thought
he
was
so
pale
so
full
of
despair
when
she
had
seen
him
last
could
he
have
killed
himself
she
wrapped
herself
quickly
in
a
loose
garment
a
sort
of
pelisse
with
a
hood
and
was
about
to
leave
the
room
when
a
bright
light
coming
through
the
chinks
of
her
door
made
her
think
of
fire
but
she
recovered
herself
as
she
heard
nanon
s
heavy
steps
and
gruff
voice
mingling
with
the
snorting
of
several
horses
can
my
father
be
carrying
off
my
cousin
she
said
to
herself
opening
her
door
with
great
precaution
lest
it
should
creak
and
yet
enough
to
let
her
see
into
the
corridor
suddenly
her
eye
encountered
that
of
her
father
and
his
glance
vague
and
unnoticing
as
it
was
terrified
her
the
goodman
and
nanon
were
yoked
together
by
a
stout
stick
each
end
of
which
rested
on
their
shoulders
a
stout
rope
was
passed
over
it
on
which
was
slung
a
small
barrel
or
keg
like
those
pere
grandet
still
made
in
his
bakehouse
as
an
amusement
for
his
leisure
hours
holy
virgin
how
heavy
it
is

of

grandet

by

candle
placed
between

rails
of
the
staircase

grandet
to
his
keeper

cornoiller
i
must
get
to
angers
before
nine
o
the
carriage
drove
off
nanon
bolted
the
great
door
let
loose
the
dog
and
went
off
to
bed
with
a
bruised
shoulder
no
one
in
the
neighborhood
suspecting
either
the
departure
of
grandet
or
the
object
of
his
journey
the
precautions
of
the
old
miser
and
his
reticence
were
never
relaxed
no
one
had
ever
seen
a
penny
in
that
house
filled
as
it
was
with
gold
hearing
in
the
morning
through
the
gossip
of
the
port
that
exchange
on
gold
had
doubled
in
price
in
consequence
of
certain
military
preparations
undertaken
at
nantes
and
that
speculators
had
arrived
at
angers
to
buy
coin
the
old
by
the
simple
process
of
borrowing
horses
from
his
farmers
seized
the
chance
of
selling
his
gold
and
of
bringing
back
in
the
form
of
treasury
notes
the
sum
he
intended
to
put
into
the
funds
having
swelled
it
considerably
by
the
exchange
viii
my
father
has
gone
thought
eugenie
who
heard
all
that
took
place
from
the
head
of
the
stairs
silence
was
restored
in
the
house
and
the
distant
rumbling
of
the
carriage
ceasing
by
degrees
no
longer
echoed
through
the
sleeping
town
at
this
moment
eugenie
heard
in
her
heart
before
the
sound
caught
her
ears
a
cry
which
pierced
the
partitions
and
came
from
her
cousin
s
chamber
a
line
of
light
thin
as
the
blade
of
a
sabre
shone
through
a
chink
in
the
door
and
fell
horizontally
on
the
balusters
of
the
rotten
staircase
he
suffers
she
said
springing
up
the
stairs
a
second
moan
brought
her
to
the
landing
near
his
room
the
door
was
ajar
she
pushed
it
open
charles
was
sleeping
his
head
hung
over
the
side
of
the
old
armchair
and
his
hand
from
which
the
pen
had
fallen
nearly
touched
the
floor
the
oppressed
breathing
caused
by
the
strained
posture
suddenly
frightened
eugenie
who
entered
the
room
hastily
he
must
be
very
tired
she
said
to
herself
glancing
at
a
dozen
letters
lying
sealed
upon
the
table
she
read
their
addresses
to
farry
breilmann
to
monsieur
buisson
tailor
etc
he
has
been
settling
all
his
affairs
so
as
to
leave
france
at
once
she
thought
her
eyes
fell
upon
two
open
letters
the
words
my
dear
annette
at
the
head
of
one
of
them
blinded
her
for
a
moment
her
heart
beat
fast
her
feet
were
nailed
to
the
floor
his
dear
annette
he
loves
he
is
loved
no
hope
what
does
he
say
to
her
these
thoughts
rushed
through
her
head
and
heart
she
saw
the
words
everywhere
even
on
the
bricks
of
the
floor
in
letters
of
fire
resign
him
already
no
no
i
will
not
read
the
letter
i
ought
to
go
away
what
if
i
do
read
it
she
looked
at
charles
then
she
gently
took
his
head
and
placed
it
against
the
back
of
the
chair
he
let
her
do
so
like
a
child
which
though
asleep
knows
its
mother
s
touch
and
receives
without
awaking
her
kisses
and
watchful
care
like
a
mother
eugenie
raised
the
drooping
hand
and
like
a
mother
she
gently
kissed
the
chestnut
hair
dear
annette
a
demon
shrieked
the
words
in
her
ear
i
am
doing
wrong
but
i
must
read
it
that
letter
she
said
she
turned
away
her
head
for
her
noble
sense
of
honor
reproached
her
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
good
and
evil
struggled
together
in
her
heart
up
to
that
moment
she
had
never
had
to
blush
for
any
action
passion
and
curiosity
triumphed
as
she
read
each
sentence
her
heart
swelled
more
and
more
and
the
keen
glow
which
filled
her
being
as
she
did
so
only
made
the
joys
of
first
love
still
more
precious
my
dear
annette
nothing
could
ever
have
separated
us
but
the
great
misfortune
which
has
now
overwhelmed
me
and
which
no
human
foresight
could
have
prevented
my
father
has
killed
himself
his
fortune
and
mine
are
irretrievably
lost
i
am
orphaned
at
an
age
when
through
the
nature
of
my
education
i
am
still
a
child
and
yet
i
must
lift
myself
as
a
man
out
of
the
abyss
into
which
i
am
plunged
i
have
just
spent
half
the
night
in
facing
my
position
if
i
wish
to
leave
france
an
honest
man
and
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
i
have
not
a
hundred
francs
of
my
own
with
which
to
try
my
fate
in
the
indies
or
in
america
yes
my
poor
anna
i
must
seek
my
fortune
in
those
deadly
climates
under
those
skies
they
tell
me
i
am
sure
to
make
it
as
for
remaining
in
paris
i
can
not
do
so
neither
my
nature
nor
my
face
are
made
to
bear
the
affronts
the
neglect
the
disdain
shown
to
a
ruined
man
the
son
of
a
bankrupt
good
god
think
of
owing
two
millions
i
should
be
killed
in
a
duel
the
first
week
therefore
i
shall
not
return
there
your
love
the
most
tender
and
devoted
love
which
ever
ennobled
the
heart
of
man
can
not
draw
me
back
alas
my
beloved
i
have
no
money
with
which
to
go
to
you
to
give
and
receive
a
last
kiss
from
which
i
might
derive
some
strength
for
my
forlorn
enterprise
poor
charles
i
did
well
to
read
the
letter
i
have
gold
i
will
give
it
to
him
thought
eugenie
she
wiped
her
eyes
and
went
on
reading
i
have
never
thought
of
the
miseries
of
poverty
if
i
have
the
hundred
louis
required
for
the
mere
costs
of
the
journey
i
have
not
a
sou
for
an
outfit
but
no
i
have
not
the
hundred
louis
not
even
one
louis
i
don
t
know
that
anything
will
be
left
after
i
have
paid
my
debts
in
paris
if
i
have
nothing
i
shall
go
quietly
to
nantes
and
ship
as
a
common
sailor
and
i
will
begin
in
the
new
world
like
other
men
who
have
started
young
without
a
sou
and
brought
back
the
wealth
of
the
indies
during
this
long
day
i
have
faced
my
future
coolly
it
seems
more
horrible
for
me
than
for
another
because
i
have
been
so
petted
by
a
mother
who
adored
me
so
indulged
by
the
kindest
of
fathers
so
blessed
by
meeting
on
my
entrance
into
life
with
the
love
of
an
anna
the
flowers
of
life
are
all
i
have
ever
known
such
happiness
could
not
last
nevertheless
my
dear
annette
i
feel
more
courage
than
a
careless
young
man
is
supposed
to
feel
above
all
a
young
man
used
to
the
caressing
ways
of
the
dearest
woman
in
all
paris
cradled
in
family
joys
on
whom
all
things
smiled
in
his
home
whose
wishes
were
a
law
to
his
father
oh
my
father
annette
he
is
dead
well
i
have
thought
over
my
position
and
yours
as
well
i
have
grown
old
in
hours
dear
anna
if
in
order
to
keep
me
with
you
in
paris
you
were
to
sacrifice
your
luxury
your
dress
your
we
should
even
then
not
have
enough
for
the
expenses
of
my
extravagant
ways
of
living
besides
i
would
never
accept
such
sacrifices
no
we
must
part
now
and
forever
he
gives
her
up
blessed
virgin
what
happiness
eugenie
quivered
with
joy
charles
made
a
movement
and
a
chill
of
terror
ran
through
her
fortunately
he
did
not
wake
and
she
resumed
her
reading
when
shall
i
return
i
do
not
know
the
climate
of
the
west
indies
ages
a
european
so
they
say
especially
a
european
who
works
hard
let
us
think
what
may
happen
ten
years
hence
in
ten
years
your
daughter
will
be
eighteen
she
will
be
your
companion
your
spy
to
you
society
will
be
cruel
and
your
daughter
perhaps
more
cruel
still
we
have
seen
cases
of
the
harsh
social
judgment
and
ingratitude
of
daughters
let
us
take
warning
by
them
keep
in
the
depths
of
your
soul
as
i
shall
in
mine
the
memory
of
four
years
of
happiness
and
be
faithful
if
you
can
to
the
memory
of
your
poor
friend
i
can
not
exact
such
faithfulness
because
do
you
see
dear
annette
i
must
conform
to
the
exigencies
of
my
new
life
i
must
take
a
commonplace
view
of
them
and
do
the
best
i
can
therefore
i
must
think
of
marriage
which
becomes
one
of
the
necessities
of
my
future
existence
and
i
will
admit
to
you
that
i
have
found
here
in
saumur
in
my
uncle
s
house
a
cousin
whose
face
manners
mind
and
heart
would
please
you
and
who
besides
seems
to
me
he
must
have
been
very
weary
to
have
ceased
writing
to
her
thought
eugenie
as
she
gazed
at
the
letter
which
stopped
abruptly
in
the
middle
of
the
last
sentence
already
she
defended
him
how
was
it
possible
that
an
innocent
girl
should
perceive
the
evinced
by
this
letter
to
young
girls
religiously
brought
up
whose
minds
are
ignorant
and
pure
all
is
love
from
the
moment
they
set
their
feet
within
the
enchanted
regions
of
that
passion
they
walk
there
bathed
in
a
celestial
light
shed
from
their
own
souls
which
reflects
its
rays
upon
their
lover
they
color
all
with
the
flame
of
their
own
emotion
and
attribute
to
him
their
highest
thoughts
a
woman
s
errors
come
almost
always
from
her
belief
in
good
or
her
confidence
in
truth
in
eugenie
s
simple
heart
the
words
my
dear
annette
my
loved
one
echoed
like
the
sweetest
language
of
love
they
caressed
her
soul
as
in
childhood
the
divine
notes
of
the
repeated
by
the
organ
caressed
her
ear
moreover
the
tears
which
still
lingered
on
the
young
man
s
lashes
gave
signs
of
that
nobility
of
heart
by
which
young
girls
are
rightly
won
how
could
she
know
that
charles
though
he
loved
his
father
and
mourned
him
truly
was
moved
far
more
by
paternal
goodness
than
by
the
goodness
of
his
own
heart
monsieur
and
madame
guillaume
grandet
by
gratifying
every
fancy
of
their
son
and
lavishing
upon
him
the
pleasures
of
a
large
fortune
had
kept
him
from
making
the
horrible
calculations
of
which
so
many
sons
in
paris
become
more
or
less
guilty
when
face
to
face
with
the
enjoyments
of
the
world
they
form
desires
and
conceive
schemes
which
they
see
with
bitterness
must
be
put
off
or
laid
aside
during
the
lifetime
of
their
parents
the
liberality
of
the
father
in
this
instance
had
shed
into
the
heart
of
the
son
a
real
love
in
which
there
was
no
afterthought
of
nevertheless
charles
was
a
true
child
of
paris
taught
by
the
customs
of
society
and
by
annette
herself
to
calculate
everything
already
an
old
man
under
the
mask
of
youth
he
had
gone
through
the
frightful
education
of
social
life
of
that
world
where
in
one
evening
more
crimes
are
committed
in
thought
and
speech
than
justice
ever
punishes
at
the
assizes
where
jests
and
clever
sayings
assassinate
the
noblest
ideas
where
no
one
is
counted
strong
unless
his
mind
sees
clear
and
to
see
clear
in
that
world
is
to
believe
in
nothing
neither
in
feelings
nor
in
men
nor
even
in
events
for
events
are
falsified
there
to
see
clear
we
must
weigh
a
friend
s
purse
daily
learn
how
to
keep
ourselves
adroitly
on
the
top
of
the
wave
cautiously
admire
nothing
neither
works
of
art
nor
glorious
actions
and
remember
that
is
the
mainspring
of
all
things
here
below
after
committing
many
follies
the
great
lady
the
beautiful
annette
compelled
charles
to
think
seriously
with
her
perfumed
hand
among
his
curls
she
talked
to
him
of
his
future
position
as
she
rearranged
his
locks
she
taught
him
lessons
of
worldly
prudence
she
made
him
effeminate
and
materialized
him
a
double
corruption
but
a
delicate
and
elegant
corruption
in
the
best
taste
you
are
very
foolish
charles
she
would
say
to
him
i
shall
have
a
great
deal
of
trouble
in
teaching
you
to
understand
the
world
you
behaved
extremely
ill
to
monsieur
des
lupeaulx
i
know
very
well
he
is
not
an
honorable
man
but
wait
till
he
is
no
longer
in
power
then
you
may
despise
him
as
much
as
you
like
do
you
know
what
madame
campan
used
to
tell
us
my
dears
as
long
as
a
man
is
a
minister
adore
him
when
he
falls
help
to
drag
him
in
the
gutter
powerful
he
is
a
sort
of
god
fallen
he
is
lower
than
marat
in
the
sewer
because
he
is
living
and
marat
is
dead
life
is
a
series
of
combinations
and
you
must
study
them
and
understand
them
if
you
want
to
keep
yourselves
always
in
good
charles
was
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
his
parents
had
made
him
too
happy
he
had
received
too
much
adulation
in
society
to
be
possessed
of
noble
sentiments
the
grain
of
gold
dropped
by
his
mother
into
his
heart
was
beaten
thin
in
the
smithy
of
parisian
society
he
had
spread
it
superficially
and
it
was
worn
away
by
the
friction
of
life
charles
was
only
years
old
at
that
age
the
freshness
of
youth
seems
inseparable
from
candor
and
sincerity
of
soul
the
voice
the
glance
the
face
itself
seem
in
harmony
with
the
feelings
and
thus
it
happens
that
the
sternest
judge
the
most
sceptical
lawyer
the
least
complying
of
usurers
always
hesitate
to
admit
decrepitude
of
heart
or
the
corruption
of
worldly
calculation
while
the
eyes
are
still
bathed
in
purity
and
no
wrinkles
seam
the
brow
charles
so
far
had
had
no
occasion
to
apply
the
maxims
of
parisian
morality
up
to
this
time
he
was
still
endowed
with
the
beauty
of
inexperience
and
yet
unknown
to
himself
he
had
been
inoculated
with
selfishness
the
germs
of
parisian
political
economy
latent
in
his
heart
would
assuredly
burst
forth
sooner
or
later
whenever
the
careless
spectator
became
an
actor
in
the
drama
of
real
life
nearly
all
young
girls
succumb
to
the
tender
promises
such
an
outward
appearance
seems
to
offer
even
if
eugenie
had
been
as
prudent
and
observing
as
provincial
girls
are
often
found
to
be
she
was
not
likely
to
distrust
her
cousin
when
his
manners
words
and
actions
were
still
in
unison
with
the
aspirations
of
a
youthful
heart
a
mere
chance
a
fatal
chance
threw
in
her
way
the
last
effusions
of
real
feeling
which
stirred
the
young
man
s
soul
she
heard
as
it
were
the
last
breathings
of
his
conscience
she
laid
down
the
letter
to
her
so
full
of
love
and
began
smilingly
to
watch
her
sleeping
cousin
the
fresh
illusions
of
life
were
still
for
her
at
least
upon
his
face
she
vowed
to
herself
to
love
him
always
then
she
cast
her
eyes
on
the
other
letter
without
attaching
much
importance
to
this
second
indiscretion
and
though
she
read
it
it
was
only
to
obtain
new
proofs
of
the
noble
qualities
which
like
all
women
she
attributed
to
the
man
her
heart
had
chosen
my
dear
alphonse
when
you
receive
this

dear
cousin
whispered
eugenie
throwing
down
the
letter
and
running
softly
back
to
her
room
carrying
one
of
the
lighted
candles
a
thrill
of
pleasure
passed
over
her
as
she
opened
the
drawer
of
an
old
oak
cabinet
a
fine
specimen
of
the
period
called
the
renaissance
on
which
could
still
be
seen
partly
effaced
the
famous
royal
salamander
she
took
from
the
drawer
a
large
purse
of
red
velvet
with
gold
tassels
edged
with
a
tarnished
fringe
of
gold
wire
a
relic
inherited
from
her
grandmother
she
weighed
it
proudly
in
her
hand
and
began
with
delight
to
count
over
the
forgotten
items
of
her
little
hoard
first
she
took
out
twenty
still
new
struck
in
the
reign
of
john
worth
by
exchange
as
her
father
told
her
five
or
a
hundred
and
francs
centimes
each
their
conventional
value
however
was
a
hundred
and
eighty
francs
apiece
on
account
of
the
rarity
and
beauty
of
the
coins
which
shone
like
little
suns
item
five
or
five
pieces
of
genoa
another
very
rare
coin
worth
francs
on
exchange
but
a
hundred
francs
to
collectors
these
had
formerly
belonged
to
old
monsieur
de
la
bertelliere
item
three
gold
spanish
of
philip
struck
in
given
to
her
one
by
one
by
madame
gentillet
who
never
failed
to
say
using
the
same
words
when
she
made
the
gift
this
dear
little
canary
this
little
is
worth
francs
keep
it
my
pretty
one
it
will
be
the
flower
of
your
item
that
which
her
father
valued
most
of
all
the
gold
of
these
coins
being
carats
and
a
fraction
a
hundred
dutch
ducats
made
in
the
year
and
worth
thirteen
francs
apiece
item
a
great
curiosity
a
species
of
medal
precious
to
the
soul
of
misers
three
rupees
with
the
sign
of
the
scales
and
five
rupees
with
the
sign
of
the
virgin
all
in
pure
gold
of
carats
the
magnificent
money
of
the
great
mogul
each
of
which
was
worth
by
mere
weight
francs
forty
centimes
but
at
least
fifty
francs
to
those
connoisseurs
who
love
to
handle
gold
item
the
napoleon
of
forty
francs
received
the
day
before
which
she
had
forgotten
to
put
away
in
the
velvet
purse
this
treasure
was
all
in
virgin
coins
true
works
of
art
which
grandet
from
time
to
time
inquired
after
and
asked
to
see
pointing
out
to
his
daughter
their
intrinsic
merits
such
as
the
beauty
of
the
milled
edge
the
clearness
of
the
flat
surface
the
richness
of
the
lettering
whose
angles
were
not
yet
rubbed
off
eugenie
gave
no
thought
to
these
rarities
nor
to
her
father
s
mania
for
them
nor
to
the
danger
she
incurred
in
depriving
herself
of
a
treasure
so
dear
to
him
no
she
thought
only
of
her
cousin
and
soon
made
out
after
a
few
mistakes
of
calculation
that
she
possessed
about
five
thousand
eight
hundred
francs
in
actual
value
which
might
be
sold
for
their
additional
value
to
collectors
for
nearly
six
thousand
she
looked
at
her
wealth
and
clapped
her
hands
like
a
happy
child
forced
to
spend
its
overflowing
joy
in
artless
movements
of
the
body
father
and
daughter
had
each
counted
up
their
fortune
this
night
he
to
sell
his
gold
eugenie
to
fling
hers
into
the
ocean
of
affection
she
put
the
pieces
back
into
the
old
purse
took
it
in
her
hand
and
ran
upstairs
without
hesitation
the
secret
misery
of
her
cousin
made
her
forget
the
hour
and
conventional
propriety
she
was
strong
in
her
conscience
in
her
devotion
in
her
happiness
as
she
stood
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
holding
the
candle
in
one
hand
and
the
purse
in
the
other
charles
woke
caught
sight
of
her
and
remained
speechless
with
surprise
eugenie
came
forward
put
the
candle
on
the
table
and
said
in
a
quivering
voice
my
cousin
i
must
beg
pardon
for
a
wrong
i
have
done
you
but
god
will
pardon
me
if
you
will
help
me
to
wipe
it
what
is
it
asked
charles
rubbing
his
eyes
i
have
read
those
charles
colored
how
did
it
happen
she
continued
how
came
i
here
truly
i
do
not
know
i
am
tempted
not
to
regret
too
much
that
i
have
read
them
they
have
made
me
know
your
heart
your
soul
and
and
what
asked
charles
your
plans
your
need
of
a
sum
my
dear
cousin
hush
hush
my
cousin
not
so
loud
we
must
not
wake
others
see
she
said
opening
her
purse
here
are
the
savings
of
a
poor
girl
who
wants
nothing
charles
accept
them
this
morning
i
was
ignorant
of
the
value
of
money
you
have
taught
it
to
me
it
is
but
a
means
after
all
a
cousin
is
almost
a
brother
you
can
surely
borrow
the
purse
of
your
eugenie
as
much
a
woman
as
a
young
girl
never
dreamed
of
refusal
but
her
cousin
remained
silent
oh
you
will
not
refuse
cried
eugenie
the
beatings
of
whose
heart
could
be
heard
in
the
deep
silence
her
cousin
s
hesitation
mortified
her
but
the
sore
need
of
his
position
came
clearer
still
to
her
mind
and
she
knelt
down
i
will
never
rise
till
you
have
taken
that
gold
she
said
my
cousin
i
implore
you
answer
me
let
me
know
if
you
respect
me
if
you
are
generous
if
as
he
heard
this
cry
of
noble
distress
the
young
man
s
tears
fell
upon
his
cousin
s
hands
which
he
had
caught
in
his
own
to
keep
her
from
kneeling
as
the
warm
tears
touched
her
eugenie
sprang
to
the
purse
and
poured
its
contents
upon
the
table
ah
yes
yes
you
consent
she
said
weeping
with
joy
fear
nothing
my
cousin
you
will
be
rich
this
gold
will
bring
you
happiness
some
day
you
shall
bring
it
back
to
me
are
we
not
partners
i
will
obey
all
conditions
but
you
should
not
attach
such
value
to
the
charles
was
at
last
able
to
express
his
feelings
yes
eugenie
my
soul
would
be
small
indeed
if
i
did
not
accept
and
yet
gift
for
gift
confidence
for
what
do
you
mean
she
said
frightened
listen
dear
cousin
i
have
here
he
interrupted
himself
to
point
out
a
square
box
covered
with
an
outer
case
of
leather
which
was
on
the
drawers
there
he
continued
is
something
as
precious
to
me
as
life
itself
this
box
was
a
present
from
my
mother
all
day
i
have
been
thinking
that
if
she
could
rise
from
her
grave
she
would
herself
sell
the
gold
which
her
love
for
me
lavished
on
this
but
were
i
to
do
so
the
act
would
seem
to
me
a
eugenie
pressed
his
hand
as
she
heard
these
last
words
no
he
added
after
a
slight
pause
during
which
a
liquid
glance
of
tenderness
passed
between
them
no
i
will
neither
sell
it
nor
risk
its
safety
on
my
journey
dear
eugenie
you
shall
be
its
guardian
never
did
friend
commit
anything
more
sacred
to
another
let
me
show
it
to
he
went
to
the
box
took
it
from
its
outer
coverings
opened
it
and
showed
his
delighted
cousin
a
where
the
rich
workmanship
gave
to
the
gold
ornaments
a
value
far
above
their
weight
what
you
admire
there
is
nothing
he
said
pushing
a
secret
spring
which
opened
a
hidden
drawer
here
is
something
which
to
me
is
worth
the
whole
he
drew
out
two
portraits
masterpieces
of
madame
mirbel
richly
set
with
pearls
oh
how
beautiful
is
it
the
lady
to
whom
you
wrote
that
no
he
said
smiling
this
is
my
mother
and
here
is
my
father
your
aunt
and
uncle
eugenie
i
beg
you
on
my
knees
keep
my
treasure
safely
if
i
die
and
your
little
fortune
is
lost
this
gold
and
these
pearls
will
repay
you
to
you
alone
could
i
leave
these
portraits
you
are
worthy
to
keep
them
but
destroy
them
at
last
so
that
they
may
pass
into
no
other
eugenie
was
silent
ah
yes
say
yes
you
consent
he
added
with
winning
grace
hearing
the
very
words
she
had
just
used
to
her
cousin
now
addressed
to
herself
she
turned
upon
him
a
look
of
love
her
first
look
of
loving
womanhood
a
glance
in
which
there
is
nearly
as
much
of
coquetry
as
of
inmost
depth
he
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
angel
of
purity
between
us
two
money
is
nothing
never
can
be
anything
feeling
sentiment
must
be
all
you
are
like
your
mother
was
her
voice
as
soft
as
yours
oh
much
softer
yes
for
you
she
said
dropping
her
eyelids
come
charles
go
to
bed
i
wish
it
you
must
be
tired
she
gently
disengaged
her
hand
from
those
of
her
cousin
who
followed
her
to
her
room
lighting
the
way
when
they
were
both
upon
the
threshold
ah
he
said
why
am
i
ruined
what
matter
my
father
is
rich
i
think
so
she
answered
poor
child
said
charles
making
a
step
into
her
room
and
leaning
his
back
against
the
wall
if
that
were
so
he
would
never
have
let
my
father
die
he
would
not
let
you
live
in
this
poor
way
he
would
live
otherwise
but
he
owns
what
is
froidfond
worth
i
don
t
know
but
he
has
nothing
but
a
poor
farm
he
has
vineyards
and
mere
nothing
said
charles
disdainfully
if
your
father
had
only
thousand
francs
a
year
do
you
suppose
you
would
live
in
this
cold
barren
room
he
added
making
a
step
in
advance
ah
there
you
will
keep
my
treasures
he
said
glancing
at
the
old
cabinet
as
if
to
hide
his
thoughts
go
and
sleep
she
said
hindering
his
entrance
into
the
disordered
room
charles
stepped
back
and
they
bid
each
other
with
a
mutual
smile
both
fell
asleep
in
the
same
dream
and
from
that
moment
the
youth
began
to
wear
roses
with
his
mourning
the
next
day
before
breakfast
madame
grandet
found
her
daughter
in
the
garden
in
company
with
charles
the
young
man
was
still
sad
as
became
a
poor
fellow
who
plunged
in
misfortune
measures
the
depths
of
the
abyss
into
which
he
has
fallen
and
sees
the
terrible
burden
of
his
whole
future
life
my
father
will
not
be
home
till
said
eugenie
perceiving
the
anxious
look
on
her
mother
s
face
it
was
easy
to
trace
in
the
face
and
manners
of
the
young
girl
and
in
the
singular
sweetness
of
her
voice
a
unison
of
thought
between
her
and
her
cousin
their
souls
had
espoused
each
other
perhaps
before
they
even
felt
the
force
of
the
feelings
which
bound
them
together
charles
spent
the
morning
in
the
hall
and
his
sadness
was
respected
each
of
the
three
women
had
occupations
of
her
own
grandet
had
left
all
his
affairs
unattended
to
and
a
number
of
persons
came
on
business
the
plumber
the
mason
the
slater
the
carpenter
the
diggers
the
dressers
the
farmers
some
to
drive
a
bargain
about
repairs
others
to
pay
their
rent
or
to
be
paid
themselves
for
services
madame
grandet
and
eugenie
were
obliged
to
go
and
come
and
listen
to
the
interminable
talk
of
all
these
workmen
and
country
folk
nanon
put
away
in
her
kitchen
the
produce
which
they
brought
as
tribute
she
always
waited
for
her
master
s
orders
before
she
knew
what
portion
was
to
be
used
in
the
house
and
what
was
to
be
sold
in
the
market
it
was
the
goodman
s
custom
like
that
of
a
great
many
country
gentlemen
to
drink
his
bad
wine
and
eat
his
spoiled
fruit
towards
five
in
the
afternoon
grandet
returned
from
angers
having
made
fourteen
thousand
francs
by
the
exchange
on
his
gold
bringing
home
in
his
wallet
good
which
bore
interest
until
the
day
he
should
invest
them
in
the
funds
he
had
left
cornoiller
at
angers
to
look
after
the
horses
which
were
foundered
with
orders
to
bring
them
home
slowly
after
they
were
rested
i
have
got
back
from
angers
wife
he
said
i
am
nanon
called
out
to
him

the
kitchen

the
old
man
nanon
brought
in
the
soup
des
grassins
came
to
take
his
client
s
orders
just
as
the
family
sat
down
to
dinner
grandet
had
not
even
observed
his
nephew
go
on
eating
grandet
said
the
banker
we
can
talk

what
gold

worth

angers

nantes

grandet

old
friends
i

to
save
you
from
such
a
loss
of

worth
thirteen
francs
fifty
say
worth
where
the
devil
have
they
got
any
i
went
to
angers
last
night
answered
grandet
in
a
low
voice
the
banker
shook
with
surprise
then
a
whispered
conversation
began
between
the
two
during
which
grandet
and
des
grassins
frequently
looked
at
charles
presently
des
grassins
gave
a
start
of
astonishment
probably
grandet
was
then
instructing
him
to
invest
the
sum
which
was
to
give
him
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
funds
monsieur
grandet
said
the
banker
to
charles
i
am
starting
for
paris

any
commissions

answered
charles

nephew

going
to
settle
the
affairs
of
the
house
of
guillaume

said
charles
eagerly
what
exclaimed
his
uncle
with
pride
are
you
not
my
nephew
your
honor
is
ours
is
not
your
name
grandet
charles
rose
seized
pere
grandet
kissed
him
turned
pale
and
left
the
room
eugenie
looked
at
her
father
with
admiration
well
des
grassins
it
is
all
in
your
hands
decoy
those
people
as
best
you
can
lead
em
by
the
the
two
diplomatists
shook
hands
the
old
cooper
accompanied
the
banker
to
the
front
door
then
after
closing
it
he
came
back
and
plunged
into
his
armchair
saying
to
nanon
get
me
some
too
excited
however
to
remain
long
in
one
place
he
got
up
looked
at
the
portrait
of
monsieur
de
la
bertelliere
and
began
to
sing
doing
what
nanon
called
his
dancing
steps
dans
les
gardes
francaises
j
avais
un
bon
nanon
madame
grandet
and
eugenie
looked
at
each
other
in
silence
the
hilarity
of
the
master
always
frightened
them
when
it
reached
its
climax
the
evening
was
soon
over
pere
grandet
chose
to
go
to
bed
early
and
when
he
went
to
bed
everybody
else
was
expected
to
go
too
like
as
when
augustus
drank
poland
was
drunk
on
this
occasion
nanon
charles
and
eugenie
were
not
less
tired
than
the
master
as
for
madame
grandet
she
slept
ate
drank
and
walked
according
to
the
will
of
her
husband
however
during
the
two
hours
consecrated
to
digestion
the
cooper
more
facetious
than
he
had
ever
been
in
his
life
uttered
a
number
of
his
own
particular
apothegms
a
single
one
of
which
will
give
the
measure
of
his
mind
when
he
had
drunk
his
ratafia
he
looked
at
his
glass
and
said
you
have
no
sooner
put
your
lips
to
a
glass
than
it
is
empty
such
is
life
you
can
t
have
and
hold
gold
won
t
circulate
and
stay
in
your
purse
if
it
were
not
for
that
life
would
be
too
he
was
jovial
and
benevolent
when
nanon
came
with
her
you
must
be
tired
he
said
put
away
your
ah
bah
then
i
shall
get
sleepy
she
answered
poor
nanon
will
you
have
some
ratafia
i
won
t
refuse
a
good
offer
madame
makes
it
a
deal
better
than
the
apothecaries
what
they
sell
is
all
they
put
too
much
sugar
said
the
master
you
can
t
taste
anything
ix
the
following
day
the
family
meeting
at
eight
o
clock
for
the
early
breakfast
made
a
picture
of
genuine
domestic
intimacy
grief
had
drawn
madame
grandet
eugenie
and
charles
even
nanon
sympathized
without
knowing
why
the
four
now
made
one
family
as
to
the
old
man
his
satisfied
avarice
and
the
certainty
of
soon
getting
rid
of
the
dandy
without
having
to
pay
more
than
his
journey
to
nantes
made
him
nearly
indifferent
to
his
presence
in
the
house
he
left
the
two
children
as
he
called
charles
and
eugenie
free
to
conduct
themselves
as
they
pleased
under
the
eye
of
madame
grandet
in
whom
he
had
implicit
confidence
as
to
all
that
concerned
public
and
religious
morality
he
busied
himself
in
straightening
the
boundaries
of
his
fields
and
ditches
along
the
in
his
beside
the
loire
in
the
winter
work
of
his
vineyards
and
at
froidfond
all
these
things
occupied
his
whole
time
for
eugenie
the
springtime
of
love
had
come
since
the
scene
at
night
when
she
gave
her
little
treasure
to
her
cousin
her
heart
had
followed
the
treasure
confederates
in
the
same
secret
they
looked
at
each
other
with
a
mutual
intelligence
which
sank
to
the
depth
of
their
consciousness
giving
a
closer
communion
a
more
intimate
relation
to
their
feelings
and
putting
them
so
to
speak
beyond
the
pale
of
ordinary
life
did
not
their
near
relationship
warrant
the
gentleness
in
their
tones
the
tenderness
in
their
glances
eugenie
took
delight
in
lulling
her
cousin
s
pain
with
the
pretty
childish
joys
of
a
love
are
there
no
sweet
similitudes
between
the
birth
of
love
and
the
birth
of
life
do
we
not
rock
the
babe
with
gentle
songs
and
softest
glances
do
we
not
tell
it
marvellous
tales
of
the
golden
future
hope
herself
does
she
not
spread
her
radiant
wings
above
its
head
does
it
not
shed
with
infant
fickleness
its
tears
of
sorrow
and
its
tears
of
joy
does
it
not
fret
for
trifles
cry
for
the
pretty
pebbles
with
which
to
build
its
shifting
palaces
for
the
flowers
forgotten
as
soon
as
plucked
is
it
not
eager
to
grasp
the
coming
time
to
spring
forward
into
life
love
is
our
second
transformation
childhood
and
love
were
one
and
the
same
thing
to
eugenie
and
to
charles
it
was
a
first
passion
with
all
its
play
the
more
caressing
to
their
hearts
because
they
now
were
wrapped
in
sadness
struggling
at
birth
against
the
gloom
of
mourning
their
love
was
only
the
more
in
harmony
with
the
provincial
plainness
of
that
gray
and
ruined
house
as
they
exchanged
a
few
words
beside
the
well
in
the
silent
court
or
lingered
in
the
garden
for
the
sunset
hour
sitting
on
a
mossy
seat
saying
to
each
other
the
infinite
nothings
of
love
or
mused
in
the
silent
calm
which
reigned
between
the
house
and
the
ramparts
like
that
beneath
the
arches
of
a
church
charles
comprehended
the
sanctity
of
love
for
his
great
lady
his
dear
annette
had
taught
him
only
its
stormy
troubles
at
this
moment
he
left
the
worldly
passion
coquettish
vain
and
showy
as
it
was
and
turned
to
the
true
pure
love
he
loved
even
the
house
whose
customs
no
longer
seemed
to
him
ridiculous
he
got
up
early
in
the
mornings
that
he
might
talk
with
eugenie
for
a
moment
before
her
father
came
to
dole
out
the
provisions
when
the
steps
of
the
old
man
sounded
on
the
staircase
he
escaped
into
the
garden
the
small
criminality
of
this
morning
which
nanon
pretended
not
to
see
gave
to
their
innocent
love
the
lively
charm
of
a
forbidden
joy
after
breakfast
when
grandet
had
gone
to
his
fields
and
his
other
occupations
charles
remained
with
the
mother
and
daughter
finding
an
unknown
pleasure
in
holding
their
skeins
in
watching
them
at
work
in
listening
to
their
quiet
prattle
the
simplicity
of
this
life
which
revealed
to
him
the
beauty
of
these
souls
unknown
and
unknowing
of
the
world
touched
him
keenly
he
had
believed
such
morals
impossible
in
france
and
admitted
their
existence
nowhere
but
in
germany
even
so
they
seemed
to
him
fabulous
only
real
in
the
novels
of
auguste
lafontaine
soon
eugenie
became
to
him
the
margaret
of
goethe
before
her
fall
day
by
day
his
words
his
looks
enraptured
the
poor
girl
who
yielded
herself
up
with
delicious
to
the
current
of
love
she
caught
her
happiness
as
a
swimmer
seizes
the
overhanging
branch
of
a
willow
to
draw
himself
from
the
river
and
lie
at
rest
upon
its
shore
did
no
dread
of
a
coming
absence
sadden
the
happy
hours
of
those
fleeting
days
daily
some
little
circumstance
reminded
them
of
the
parting
that
was
at
hand
three
days
after
the
departure
of
des
grassins
grandet
took
his
nephew
to
the
civil
courts
with
the
solemnity
which
country
people
attach
to
all
legal
acts
that
he
might
sign
a
deed
surrendering
his
rights
in
his
father
s
estate
terrible
renunciation
species
of
domestic
apostasy
charles
also
went
before
maitre
cruchot
to
make
two
powers
of
attorney
one
for
des
grassins
the
other
for
the
friend
whom
he
had
charged
with
the
sale
of
his
belongings
after
that
he
attended
to
all
the
formalities
necessary
to
obtain
a
passport
for
foreign
countries
and
finally
when
he
received
his
simple
mourning
clothes
from
paris
he
sent
for
the
tailor
of
saumur
and
sold
to
him
his
useless
wardrobe
this
last
act
pleased
grandet
exceedingly
ah
now
you
look
like
a
man
prepared
to
embark
and
make
your
fortune
he
said
when
charles
appeared
in
a
surtout
of
plain
black
cloth
good
very
good
i
hope
you
will
believe
monsieur
answered
his
nephew
that
i
shall
always
try
to
conform
to
my
what
s
that
said
his
uncle
his
eyes
lighting
up
at
a
handful
of
gold
which
charles
was
carrying
monsieur
i
have
collected
all
my
buttons
and
rings
and
other
superfluities
which
may
have
some
value
but
not
knowing
any
one
in
saumur
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
to
buy
them
said
grandet
interrupting
him
no
uncle
only
to
tell
me
of
an
honest
man
who
give
me
those
things
i
will
go
upstairs
and
estimate
their
value
i
will
come
back
and
tell
you
what
it
is
to
a
fraction
jeweller
s
gold
examining
a
long
chain
eighteen
or
nineteen
the
goodman
held
out
his
huge
hand
and
received
the
mass
of
gold
which
he
carried
away
cousin
said
grandet
may
i
offer
you
these
two
buttons
they
can
fasten
ribbons
round
your
wrists
that
sort
of
bracelet
is
much
the
fashion
just
i
accept
without
hesitation
she
answered
giving
him
an
understanding
look
aunt
here
is
my
mother
s
thimble
i
have
always
kept
it
carefully
in
my
said
charles
presenting
a
pretty
gold
thimble
to
madame
grandet
who
for
many
years
had
longed
for
one
i
can
not
thank
you
no
words
are
possible
my
nephew
said
the
poor
mother
whose
eyes
filled
with
tears
night
and
morning
in
my
prayers
i
shall
add
one
for
you
the
most
earnest
of
all
for
those
who
travel
if
i
die
eugenie
will
keep
this
treasure
for
they
are
worth
nine
hundred
and
francs
centimes
said
grandet
opening
the
door
to
save
you
the
pain
of
selling
them
i
will
advance
the
money
in
the
word
on
the
littoral
of
the
loire
signifies
that
crown
prices
of
six
are
to
be
accepted
as
six
francs
without
deduction
i
dared
not
propose
it
to
you
answered
charles
but
it
was
most
repugnant
to
me
to
sell
my
jewels
to
some
dealer
in
your
own
town
people
should
wash
their
dirty
linen
at
home
as
napoleon
said
i
thank
you
for
your
grandet
scratched
his
ear
and
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
my
dear
uncle
resumed
charles
looking
at
him
with
an
uneasy
air
as
if
he
feared
to
wound
his
feelings
my
aunt
and
cousin
have
been
kind
enough
to
accept
a
trifling
remembrance
of
me
will
you
allow
me
to
give
you
these
which
are
useless
to
me
now
they
will
remind
you
of
a
poor
fellow
who
far
away
will
always
think
of
those
who
are
henceforth
all
his
my
lad
my
lad
you
mustn
t
rob
yourself
this
way
let
me
see
wife
what
have
you
got
he
added
turning
eagerly
to
her
ah
a
gold
thimble
and
you
little
girl
what
diamond
buttons
yes
i
ll
accept
your
present
nephew
he
answered
shaking
charles
by
the
hand
but
you
must
let
me
pay
your
yes
your
passage
to
the
indies
yes
i
wish
to
pay
your
passage
because
d
ye
see
my
boy
in
valuing
your
jewels
i
estimated
only
the
weight
of
the
gold
very
likely
the
workmanship
is
worth
something
so
let
us
settle
it
that
i
am
to
give
you
fifteen
hundred
francs
in
cruchot
will
lend
them
to
me
i
haven
t
got
a
copper
farthing
here
unless
perrotet
who
is
behindhand
with
his
rent
should
pay
up
by
the
bye
i
ll
go
and
see
he
took
his
hat
put
on
his
gloves
and
went
out
then
you
are
really
going
said
eugenie
to
her
cousin
with
a
sad
look
mingled
with
admiration
i
must
he
said
bowing
his
head
for
some
days
past
charles
s
whole
bearing
manners
and
speech
had
become
those
of
a
man
who
in
spite
of
his
profound
affliction
feels
the
weight
of
immense
obligations
and
has
the
strength
to
gather
courage
from
misfortune
he
no
longer
repined
he
became
a
man
eugenie
never
augured
better
of
her
cousin
s
character
than
when
she
saw
him
come
down
in
the
plain
black
clothes
which
suited
well
with
his
pale
face
and
sombre
countenance
on
that
day
the
two
women
put
on
their
own
mourning
and
all
three
assisted
at
a
requiem
celebrated
in
the
parish
church
for
the
soul
of
the
late
guillaume
grandet
at
the
second
breakfast
charles
received
letters
from
paris
and
began
to
read
them
well
cousin
are
you
satisfied
with
the
management
of
your
affairs
said
eugenie
in
a
low
voice
never
ask
such
questions
my
daughter
said
grandet
what
the
devil
do
i
tell
you
my
affairs
why
do
you
poke
your
nose
into
your
cousin
s
let
the
lad
alone
oh
i
haven
t
any
secrets
said
charles
ta
ta
ta
ta
nephew
you
ll
soon
find
out
that
you
must
hold
your
tongue
in
when
the
two
lovers
were
alone
in
the
garden
charles
said
to
eugenie
drawing
her
down
on
the
old
bench
beneath
the
i
did
right
to
trust
alphonse
he
has
done
famously
he
has
managed
my
affairs
with
prudence
and
good
faith
i
now
owe
nothing
in
paris
all
my
things
have
been
sold
and
he
tells
me
that
he
has
taken
the
advice
of
an
old
and
spent
three
thousand
francs
on
a
commercial
outfit
of
european
curiosities
which
will
be
sure
to
be
in
demand
in
the
indies
he
has
sent
my
trunks
to
nantes
where
a
ship
is
loading
for
san
domingo
in
five
days
eugenie
we
must
bid
each
other
farewell
perhaps
forever
at
least
for
years
my
outfit
and
ten
thousand
francs
which
two
of
my
friends
send
me
are
a
very
small
beginning
i
can
not
look
to
return
for
many
years
my
dear
cousin
do
not
weight
your
life
in
the
scales
with
mine
i
may
perish
some
good
marriage
may
be
offered
to
you
do
you
love
me
she
said
oh
yes
indeed
yes
he
answered
with
a
depth
of
tone
that
revealed
an
equal
depth
of
feeling
i
shall
wait
charles
good
heavens
there
is
my
father
at
his
window
she
said
repulsing
her
cousin
who
leaned
forward
to
kiss
her
she
ran
quickly
under
the
archway
charles
followed
her
when
she
saw
him
she
retreated
to
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
opened
the
then
scarcely
knowing
where
she
was
going
eugenie
reached
the
corner
near
nanon
s
den
in
the
darkest
end
of
the
passage
there
charles
caught
her
hand
and
drew
her
to
his
heart
passing
his
arm
about
her
waist
he
made
her
lean
gently
upon
him
eugenie
no
longer
resisted
she
received
and
gave
the
purest
the
sweetest
and
yet
withal
the
most
unreserved
of
kisses
dear
eugenie
a
cousin
is
better
than
a
brother
for
he
can
marry
you
said
charles
so
be
it
cried
nanon
opening
the
door
of
her
lair
the
two
lovers
alarmed
fled
into
the
hall
where
eugenie
took
up
her
work
and
charles
began
to
read
the
litanies
of
the
virgin
in
madame
grandet
s
mercy
cried
nanon
now
they
re
saying
their
as
soon
as
charles
announced
his
immediate
departure
grandet
bestirred
himself
to
testify
much
interest
in
his
nephew
he
became
very
liberal
of
all
that
cost
him
nothing
took
pains
to
find
a
packer
declared
the
man
asked
too
much
for
his
cases
insisted
on
making
them
himself
out
of
old
planks
got
up
early
in
the
morning
to
fit
and
plane
and
nail
together
the
strips
out
of
which
he
made
to
his
own
satisfaction
some
strong
cases
in
which
he
packed
all
charles
s
effects
he
also
took
upon
himself
to
send
them
by
boat
down
the
loire
to
insure
them
and
get
them
to
nantes
in
proper
time
after
the
kiss
taken
in
the
passage
the
hours
fled
for
eugenie
with
frightful
rapidity
sometimes
she
thought
of
following
her
cousin
those
who
have
known
that
most
endearing
of
all
passions
the
one
whose
duration
is
each
day
shortened
by
time
by
age
by
mortal
illness
by
human
chances
and
fatalities
they
will
understand
the
poor
girl
s
tortures
she
wept
as
she
walked
in
the
garden
now
so
narrow
to
her
as
indeed
the
court
the
house
the
town
all
seemed
she
launched
in
thought
upon
the
wide
expanse
of
the
ocean
he
was
about
to
traverse
at
last
the
eve
of
his
departure
came
that
morning
in
the
absence
of
grandet
and
of
nanon
the
precious
case
which
contained
the
two
portraits
was
solemnly
installed
in
the
only
drawer
of
the
old
cabinet
which
could
be
locked
where
the
now
empty
velvet
purse
was
lying
this
deposit
was
not
made
without
a
goodly
number
of
tears
and
kisses
when
eugenie
placed
the
key
within
her
bosom
she
had
no
courage
to
forbid
the
kiss
with
which
charles
sealed
the
act
it
shall
never
leave
that
place
my
friend
she
said
then
my
heart
will
be
always
ah
charles
it
is
not
right
she
said
as
though
she
blamed
him
are
we
not
married
he
said
i
have
thy
promise
then
take
thine
i
am
thine
forever
they
each
said
repeating
the
words
twice
over
no
promise
made
upon
this
earth
was
ever
purer
the
innocent
sincerity
of
eugenie
had
sanctified
for
a
moment
the
young
man
s
love
on
the
morrow
the
breakfast
was
sad
nanon
herself
in
spite
of
the
robe
and
the
jeannette
cross
bestowed
by
charles
had
tears
in
her
eyes
the
poor
dear
monsieur
who
is
going
on
the
seas
oh
may
god
guide
him
at
ten
the
whole
family
started
to
escort
charles
to
the
diligence
for
nantes
nanon
let
loose
the
dog
locked
the
door
and
insisted
on
carrying
the
young
man
s
all
the
tradesmen
in
the
tortuous
old
street
were
on
the
sill
of
their
to
watch
the
procession
which
was
joined
in
the
by
maitre
cruchot
eugenie
be
sure
you
don
t
cry
said
her
mother
nephew
said
grandet
in
the
doorway
of
the
inn
from
which
the
coach
started
kissing
charles
on
both
cheeks
depart
poor
return
rich
you
will
find
the
honor
of
your
father
safe
i
answer
for
that
myself
i
grandet
for
it
will
only
depend
on
you
to
ah
my
uncle
you
soften
the
bitterness
of
my
departure
is
it
not
the
best
gift
that
you
could
make
me
not
understanding
his
uncle
s
words
which
he
had
thus
interrupted
charles
shed
tears
of
gratitude
upon
the
tanned
cheeks
of
the
old
miser
while
eugenie
pressed
the
hand
of
her
cousin
and
that
of
her
father
with
all
her
strength
the
notary
smiled
admiring
the
sly
speech
of
the
old
man
which
he
alone
had
understood
the
family
stood
about
the
coach
until
it
started
then
as
it
disappeared
upon
the
bridge
and
its
rumble
grew
fainter
in
the
distance
grandet
said
to
you
happily
no
one
but
maitre
cruchot
heard
the
exclamation
eugenie
and
her
mother
had
gone
to
a
corner
of
the
quay
from
which
they
could
still
see
the
diligence
and
wave
their
white
handkerchiefs
to
which
charles
made
answer
by
displaying
his
ah
mother
would
that
i
had
the
power
of
god
for
a
single
moment
said
eugenie
when
she
could
no
longer
see
her
lover
s
handkerchief
not
to
interrupt
the
current
of
events
which
are
about
to
take
place
in
the
bosom
of
the
grandet
family
it
is
necessary
to
cast
a
forestalling
eye
upon
the
various
operations
which
the
goodman
carried
on
in
paris
by
means
of
monsieur
des
grassins
a
month
after
the
latter
s
departure
from
saumur
grandet
became
possessed
of
a
certificate
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
from
his
investment
in
the
funds
bought
at
eighty
francs
net
the
particulars
revealed
at
his
death
by
the
inventory
of
his
property
threw
no
light
upon
the
means
which
his
suspicious
nature
took
to
remit
the
price
of
the
investment
and
receive
the
certificate
thereof
maitre
cruchot
was
of
opinion
that
nanon
unknown
to
herself
was
the
trusty
instrument
by
which
the
money
was
transported
for
about
this
time
she
was
absent
five
days
under
a
pretext
of
putting
things
to
rights
at
froidfond
as
if
the
goodman
were
capable
of
leaving
anything
lying
about
or
out
of
order
in
all
that
concerned
the
business
of
the
house
of
guillaume
grandet
the
old
cooper
s
intentions
were
fulfilled
to
the
letter
the
bank
of
france
as
everybody
knows
affords
exact
information
about
all
the
large
fortunes
in
paris
and
the
provinces
the
names
of
des
grassins
and
felix
grandet
of
saumur
were
well
known
there
and
they
enjoyed
the
esteem
bestowed
on
financial
celebrities
whose
wealth
comes
from
immense
and
unencumbered
territorial
possessions
the
arrival
of
the
saumur
banker
for
the
purpose
it
was
said
of
honorably
liquidating
the
affairs
of
grandet
of
paris
was
enough
to
avert
the
shame
of
protested
notes
from
the
memory
of
the
defunct
merchant
the
seals
on
the
property
were
taken
off
in
presence
of
the
creditors
and
the
notary
employed
by
grandet
went
to
work
at
once
on
the
inventory
of
the
assets
soon
after
this
des
grassins
called
a
meeting
of
the
creditors
who
unanimously
elected
him
conjointly
with
francois
keller
the
head
of
a
rich
and
one
of
those
principally
interested
in
the
affair
as
liquidators
with
full
power
to
protect
both
the
honor
of
the
family
and
the
interests
of
the
claimants
the
credit
of
grandet
of
saumur
the
hopes
he
diffused
by
means
of
des
grassins
in
the
minds
of
all
concerned
facilitated
the
transactions
not
a
single
creditor
proved
recalcitrant
no
one
thought
of
passing
his
claim
to
his
account
each
and
all
said
confidently
grandet
of
saumur
will
six
months
went
by
the
parisians
had
redeemed
the
notes
in
circulation
as
they
fell
due
and
held
them
under
lock
and
key
in
their
desks
first
result
aimed
at
by
the
old
cooper
nine
months
after
this
preliminary
meeting
the
two
liquidators
distributed
per
cent
to
each
creditor
on
his
claim
this
amount
was
obtained
by
the
sale
of
the
securities
property
and
possessions
of
all
kinds
belonging
to
the
late
guillaume
grandet
and
was
paid
over
with
scrupulous
fidelity
unimpeachable
integrity
was
shown
in
the
transaction
the
creditors
gratefully
acknowledged
the
remarkable
and
incontestable
honor
displayed
by
the
grandets
when
these
praises
had
circulated
for
a
certain
length
of
time
the
creditors
asked
for
the
rest
of
their
money
it
became
necessary
to
write
a
collective
letter
to
grandet
of
saumur
here
it
comes
said
the
old
man
as
he
threw
the
letter
into
the
fire
patience
my
good
friends
in
answer
to
the
proposals
contained
in
the
letter
grandet
of
saumur
demanded
that
all
vouchers
for
claims
against
the
estate
of
his
brother
should
be
deposited
with
a
notary
together
with
acquittances
for
the
per
cent
already
paid
he
made
this
demand
under
pretence
of
sifting
the
accounts
and
finding
out
the
exact
condition
of
the
estate
it
roused
at
once
a
variety
of
difficulties
generally
speaking
the
creditor
is
a
species
of
maniac
ready
to
agree
to
anything
one
day
on
the
next
breathing
fire
and
slaughter
later
on
he
grows
amicable
and
his
wife
is
his
last
baby
has
cut
its
first
tooth
all
is
well
at
home
and
he
is
determined
not
to
lose
a
sou
on
the
morrow
it
rains
he
can
t
go
out
he
is
gloomy
he
says
yes
to
any
proposal
that
is
made
to
him
so
long
as
it
will
put
an
end
to
the
affair
on
the
third
day
he
declares
he
must
have
guarantees
by
the
end
of
the
month
he
wants
his
debtor
s
head
and
becomes
at
heart
an
executioner
the
creditor
is
a
good
deal
like
the
sparrow
on
whose
tail
confiding
children
are
invited
to
put
salt
with
this
difference
that
he
applies
the
image
to
his
claim
the
proceeds
of
which
he
is
never
able
to
lay
hold
of
grandet
had
studied
the
atmospheric
variations
of
creditors
and
the
creditors
of
his
brother
justified
all
his
calculations
some
were
angry
and
flatly
refused
to
give
in
their
vouchers
very
good
so
much
the
better
said
grandet
rubbing
his
hands
over
the
letter
in
which
des
grassins
announced
the
fact
others
agreed
to
the
demand
but
only
on
condition
that
their
rights
should
be
fully
guaranteed
they
renounced
none
and
even
reserved
the
power
of
ultimately
compelling
a
failure
on
this
began
a
long
correspondence
which
ended
in
grandet
of
saumur
agreeing
to
all
conditions
by
means
of
this
concession
the
placable
creditors
were
able
to
bring
the
dissatisfied
creditors
to
reason
the
deposit
was
then
made
but
not
without
sundry
complaints
your
goodman
they
said
to
des
grassins
is
tricking
months
after
the
death
of
guillaume
grandet
many
of
the
creditors
carried
away
by
more
pressing
business
in
the
markets
of
paris
had
forgotten
their
grandet
claims
or
only
thought
of
them
to
say
i
begin
to
believe
that
per
cent
is
all
i
shall
ever
get
out
of
that
the
old
cooper
had
calculated
on
the
power
of
time
which
as
he
used
to
say
is
a
pretty
good
devil
after
all
by
the
end
of
the
third
year
des
grassins
wrote
to
grandet
that
he
had
brought
the
creditors
to
agree
to
give
up
their
claims
for
ten
per
cent
on
the
two
million
four
hundred
thousand
francs
still
due
by
the
house
of
grandet
grandet
answered
that
the
notary
and
the
broker
whose
shameful
failures
had
caused
the
death
of
his
brother
were
still
living
that
they
might
now
have
recovered
their
credit
and
that
they
ought
to
be
sued
so
as
to
get
something
out
of
them
towards
lessening
the
total
of
the
deficit
by
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
the
liabilities
were
definitely
estimated
at
a
sum
of
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
many
negotiations
lasting
over
six
months
took
place
between
the
creditors
and
the
liquidators
and
between
the
liquidators
and
grandet
to
make
a
long
story
short
grandet
of
saumur
anxious
by
this
time
to
get
out
of
the
affair
told
the
liquidators
about
the
ninth
month
of
the
fourth
year
that
his
nephew
had
made
a
fortune
in
the
indies
and
was
disposed
to
pay
his
father
s
debts
in
full
he
therefore
could
not
take
upon
himself
to
make
any
settlement
without
previously
consulting
him
he
had
written
to
him
and
was
expecting
an
answer
the
creditors
were
held
in
check
until
the
middle
of
the
fifth
year
by
the
words
payment
in
full
which
the
wily
old
miser
threw
out
from
time
to
time
as
he
laughed
in
his
beard
saying
with
a
smile
and
an
oath
those
parisians
but
the
creditors
were
reserved
for
a
fate
unexampled
in
the
annals
of
commerce
when
the
events
of
this
history
bring
them
once
more
into
notice
they
will
be
found
still
in
the
position
grandet
had
resolved
to
force
them
into
from
the
first
as
soon
as
the
funds
reached
a
hundred
and
fifteen
pere
grandet
sold
out
his
interests
and
withdrew
two
million
four
hundred
thousand
francs
in
gold
to
which
he
added
in
his
coffers
the
six
hundred
thousand
francs
compound
interest
which
he
had
derived
from
the
capital
des
grassins
now
lived
in
paris
in
the
first
place
he
had
been
made
a
deputy
then
he
became
infatuated
father
of
a
family
as
he
was
though
horribly
bored
by
the
provincial
life
of
saumur
with
a
pretty
actress
at
the
theatre
de
madame
known
as
florine
and
he
presently
relapsed
into
the
old
habits
of
his
army
life
it
is
useless
to
speak
of
his
conduct
saumur
considered
it
profoundly
immoral
his
wife
was
fortunate
in
the
fact
of
her
property
being
settled
upon
herself
and
in
having
sufficient
ability
to
keep
up
the
in
saumur
which
was
managed
in
her
name
and
repaired
the
breach
in
her
fortune
caused
by
the
extravagance
of
her
husband
the
cruchotines
made
so
much
talk
about
the
false
position
of
the
that
she
married
her
daughter
very
badly
and
was
forced
to
give
up
all
hope
of
an
alliance
between
eugenie
grandet
and
her
son
adolphe
joined
his
father
in
paris
and
became
it
was
said
a
worthless
fellow
the
cruchots
triumphed
your
husband
hasn
t
common
sense
said
grandet
as
he
lent
madame
des
grassins
some
money
on
a
note
securely
endorsed
i
am
very
sorry
for
you
for
you
are
a
good
little
ah
monsieur
said
the
poor
lady
who
could
have
believed
that
when
he
left
saumur
to
go
to
paris
on
your
business
he
was
going
to
his
ruin
heaven
is
my
witness
madame
that
up
to
the
last
moment
i
did
all
i
could
to
prevent
him
from
going
monsieur
le
president
was
most
anxious
to
take
his
place
but
he
was
determined
to
go
and
now
we
all
see
in
this
way
grandet
made
it
quite
plain
that
he
was
under
no
obligation
to
des
grassins
in
all
situations
women
have
more
cause
for
suffering
than
men
and
they
suffer
more
man
has
strength
and
the
power
of
exercising
it
he
acts
moves
thinks
occupies
himself
he
looks
ahead
and
sees
consolation
in
the
future
it
was
thus
with
charles
but
the
woman
stays
at
home
she
is
always
face
to
face
with
the
grief
from
which
nothing
distracts
her
she
goes
down
to
the
depths
of
the
abyss
which
yawns
before
her
measures
it
and
often
fills
it
with
her
tears
and
prayers
thus
did
eugenie
she
initiated
herself
into
her
destiny
to
feel
to
love
to
suffer
to
devote
herself
is
not
this
the
sum
of
woman
s
life
eugenie
was
to
be
in
all
things
a
woman
except
in
the
one
thing
that
consoles
for
all
her
happiness
picked
up
like
nails
scattered
on
a
wall
to
use
the
fine
simile
of
bossuet
would
never
so
much
as
fill
even
the
hollow
of
her
hand
sorrows
are
never
long
in
coming
for
her
they
came
soon
the
day
after
charles
s
departure
the
house
of
monsieur
grandet
resumed
its
ordinary
aspect
in
the
eyes
of
all
except
in
those
of
eugenie
to
whom
it
grew
suddenly
empty
she
wished
if
it
could
be
done
unknown
to
her
father
that
charles
s
room
might
be
kept
as
he
had
left
it
madame
grandet
and
nanon
were
willing
accomplices
in
this
who
knows
but
he
may
come
back
sooner
than
we
think
for
she
said
ah
don
t
i
wish
i
could
see
him
back
answered
nanon
i
took
to
him
he
was
such
a
dear
sweet
young
man
pretty
too
with
his
curly
eugenie
looked
at
nanon
holy
virgin
don
t
look
at
me
that
way
mademoiselle
your
eyes
are
like
those
of
a
lost
from
that
day
the
beauty
of
mademoiselle
grandet
took
a
new
character
the
solemn
thoughts
of
love
which
slowly
filled
her
soul
and
the
dignity
of
the
woman
beloved
gave
to
her
features
an
illumination
such
as
painters
render
by
a
halo
before
the
coming
of
her
cousin
eugenie
might
be
compared
to
the
virgin
before
the
conception
after
he
had
gone
she
was
like
the
virgin
mother
she
had
given
birth
to
love
these
two
marys
so
different
so
well
represented
by
spanish
art
embody
one
of
those
shining
symbols
with
which
christianity
abounds
returning
from
mass
on
the
morning
after
charles
s
departure
having
made
a
vow
to
hear
it
daily
eugenie
bought
a
map
of
the
world
which
she
nailed
up
beside
her
that
she
might
follow
her
cousin
on
his
westward
way
that
she
might
put
herself
were
it
ever
so
little
day
by
day
into
the
ship
that
bore
him
and
see
him
and
ask
him
a
thousand
questions
art
thou
well
dost
thou
suffer
dost
thou
think
of
me
when
the
star
whose
beauty
and
usefulness
thou
hast
taught
me
to
know
shines
upon
thee
in
the
mornings
she
sat
pensive
beneath
the
on
the
bench
covered
with
gray
lichens
where
they
had
said
to
each
other
so
many
precious
things
so
many
trifles
where
they
had
built
the
pretty
castles
of
their
future
home
she
thought
of
the
future
now
as
she
looked
upward
to
the
bit
of
sky
which
was
all
the
high
walls
suffered
her
to
see
then
she
turned
her
eyes
to
the
angle
where
the
sun
crept
on
and
to
the
roof
above
the
room
in
which
he
had
slept
hers
was
the
solitary
love
the
persistent
love
which
glides
into
every
thought
and
becomes
the
substance
or
as
our
fathers
might
have
said
the
tissue
of
life
when
the
friends
of
pere
grandet
came
in
the
evening
for
their
game
at
cards
she
was
gay
and
dissimulating
but
all
the
morning
she
talked
of
charles
with
her
mother
and
nanon
nanon
had
brought
herself
to
see
that
she
could
pity
the
sufferings
of
her
young
mistress
without
failing
in
her
duty
to
the
old
master
and
she
would
say
to
eugenie
if
i
had
a
man
for
myself
i
d
i
d
follow
him
to
hell
yes
i
d
exterminate
myself
for
him
but
i

that
old
cornoiller
a
good
fellow
all
the
same
is
always
round
my
petticoats
for
the
sake
of
my
money
just
for
all
the
world
like
the
rats
who
come
smelling
after
the
master

cheese
and
paying
court
to
you
i

i

though
i

as
big
as

well
mamz
elle
it
pleases
me
but
it
isn
t
x
two
months
went
by
this
domestic
life
once
so
monotonous
was
now
quickened
with
the
intense
interest
of
a
secret
that
bound
these
women
intimately
together
for
them
charles
lived
and
moved
beneath
the
grim
gray
rafters
of
the
hall
night
and
morning
eugenie
opened
the
and
gazed
at
the
portrait
of
her
aunt
one
sunday
morning
her
mother
surprised
her
as
she
stood
absorbed
in
finding
her
cousin
s
features
in
his
mother
s
face
madame
grandet
was
then
for
the
first
time
admitted
into
the
terrible
secret
of
the
exchange
made
by
charles
against
her
daughter
s
treasure
you
gave
him
all
cried
the
poor
mother
terrified
what
will
you
say
to
your
father
on
new
year
s
day
when
he
asks
to
see
your
gold
eugenie
s
eyes
grew
fixed
and
the
two
women
lived
through
mortal
terror
for
more
than
half
the
morning
they
were
so
troubled
in
mind
that
they
missed
high
mass
and
only
went
to
the
military
service
in
three
days
the
year
would
come
to
an
end
in
three
days
a
terrible
drama
would
begin
a
bourgeois
tragedy
without
poison
or
dagger
or
the
spilling
of
blood
but
as
regards
the
actors
in
it
more
cruel
than
all
the
fabled
horrors
in
the
family
of
the
atrides
what
will
become
of
us
said
madame
grandet
to
her
daughter
letting
her
knitting
fall
upon
her
knees
the
poor
mother
had
gone
through
such
anxiety
for
the
past
two
months
that
the
woollen
sleeves
which
she
needed
for
the
coming
winter
were
not
yet
finished
this
domestic
fact
insignificant
as
it
seems
bore
sad
results
for
want
of
those
sleeves
a
chill
seized
her
in
the
midst
of
a
sweat
caused
by
a
terrible
explosion
of
anger
on
the
part
of
her
husband
i
have
been
thinking
my
poor
child
that
if
you
had
confided
your
secret
to
me
we
should
have
had
time
to
write
to
monsieur
des
grassins
in
paris
he
might
have
sent
us
gold
pieces
like
yours
though
grandet
knows
them
all
perhaps
where
could
we
have
got
the
money
i
would
have
pledged
my
own
property
besides
monsieur
des
grassins
would
have
it
is
too
late
said
eugenie
in
a
broken
hollow
voice
morning
we
must
go
and
wish
him
a
happy
new
year
in
his
but
my
daughter
why
should
i
not
consult
the
cruchots
no
no
it
would
be
delivering
me
up
to
them
and
putting
ourselves
in
their
power
besides
i
have
chosen
my
course
i
have
done
right
i
repent
of
nothing
god
will
protect
me
his
will
be
done
ah
mother
if
you
had
read
his
letter
you
too
would
have
thought
only
of
the
next
morning
january
the
horrible
fear
to
which
mother
and
daughter
were
a
prey
suggested
to
their
minds
a
natural
excuse
by
which
to
escape
the
solemn
entrance
into
grandet
s
chamber
the
winter
of
was
one
of
the
coldest
of
that
epoch
the
snow
encumbered
the
roofs
madame
grandet
called
to
her
husband
as
soon
as
she
heard
him
stirring
in
his
chamber
and
said
grandet
will
you
let
nanon
light
a
fire
here
for
me
the
cold
is
so
sharp
that
i
am
freezing
under
the
bedclothes
at
my
age
i
need
some
comforts
besides
she
added
after
a
slight
pause
eugenie
shall
come
and
dress
here
the
poor
child
might
get
an
illness
from
dressing
in
her
cold
room
in
such
weather
then
we
will
go
and
wish
you
a
happy
new
year
beside
the
fire
in
the
ta
ta
ta
ta
what
a
tongue
a
pretty
way
to
begin
the
new
year
madame
grandet
you
never
talked
so
much
before
but
you
haven
t
been
sopping
your
bread
in
wine
i
know
there
was
a
moment
s
silence
well
resumed
the
goodman
who
no
doubt
had
some
reason
of
his
own
for
agreeing
to
his
wife
s
request
i
ll
do
what
you
ask
madame
grandet
you
are
a
good
woman
and
i
don
t
want
any
harm
to
happen
to
you
at
your
time
of
life
though
as
a
general
thing
the
bertellieres
are
as
sound
as
a
roach
hein
isn
t
that
so
he
added
after
a
pause
well
i
forgive
them
we
got
their
property
in
the
and
he
coughed
you
are
very
gay
this
morning
monsieur
said
the
poor
woman
gravely
i
m
always
gay
gai
gai
gai
le
tonnelier
raccommodez
votre
cuvier
he
answered
entering
his
wife
s
room
fully
dressed
yes
on
my
word
it
is
cold
enough
to
freeze
you
solid
we
shall
have
a
fine
breakfast
wife
des
grassins
has
sent
me
a
truffled
i
am
going
now
to
get
it
at
the
there
ll
be
a
double
napoleon
for
eugenie
in
the
package
he
whispered
in
madame
grandet
s
ear
i
have
no
gold
left
wife
i
had
a
few
stray
pieces
i
don
t
mind
telling
you
that
but
i
had
to
let
them
go
in
then
by
way
of
celebrating
the
new
year
he
kissed
her
on
the
forehead
eugenie
cried
the
mother
when
grandet
was
fairly
gone
i
don
t
know
which
side
of
the
bed
your
father
got
out
of
but
he
is
this
morning
perhaps
we
shall
come
out
safe
after
all
what
s
happened
to
the
master
said
nanon
entering
her
mistress
s
room
to
light
the
fire
first
place
he
said
happy
new
year
you
big
fool
go
and
light
my
wife
s
fire
she
s
cold
and
then
didn
t
i
feel
silly
when
he
held
out
his
hand
and
gave
me
a
piece
which
isn
t
worn
one
bit
just
look
at
it
madame
oh
the
kind
man
he
is
a
good
man
that
s
a
fact
there
are
some
people
who
the
older
they
get
the
harder
they
grow
but
he
why
he
s
getting
soft
and
improving
with
time
like
your
ratafia
he
is
a
good
good
man
the
secret
of
grandet
s
joy
lay
in
the
complete
success
of
his
speculation
monsieur
des
grassins
after
deducting
the
amount
which
the
old
cooper
owed
him
for
the
discount
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
dutch
notes
and
for
the
surplus
which
he
had
advanced
to
make
up
the
sum
required
for
the
investment
in
the
funds
which
was
to
produce
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
had
now
sent
him
by
the
diligence
thirty
thousand
francs
in
silver
coin
the
remainder
of
his
first
s
interest
informing
him
at
the
same
time
that
the
funds
had
already
gone
up
in
value
they
were
then
quoted
at
the
shrewdest
capitalists
bought
in
towards
the
last
of
january
at
grandet
had
thus
gained
in
two
months
twelve
per
cent
on
his
capital
he
had
simplified
his
accounts
and
would
in
future
receive
fifty
thousand
francs
interest
every
six
months
without
incurring
any
taxes
or
costs
for
repairs
he
understood
at
last
what
it
was
to
invest
money
in
the
public
securities
a
system
for
which
provincials
have
always
shown
a
marked
repugnance
and
at
the
end
of
five
years
he
found
himself
master
of
a
capital
of
six
millions
which
increased
without
much
effort
of
his
own
and
which
joined
to
the
value
and
proceeds
of
his
territorial
possessions
gave
him
a
fortune
that
was
absolutely
colossal
the
six
francs
bestowed
on
nanon
were
perhaps
the
reward
of
some
great
service
which
the
poor
servant
had
rendered
to
her
master
unawares
oh
oh
where
s
pere
grandet
going
he
has
been
scurrying
about
since
sunrise
as
if
to
a
fire
said
the
tradespeople
to
each
other
as
they
opened
their
shops
for
the
day
when
they
saw
him
coming
back
from
the
wharf
followed
by
a
porter
from
the
wheeling
a
barrow
which
was
laden
with
sacks
they
all
had
their
comments
to
make
water
flows
to
the
river
the
old
fellow
was
running
after
his
gold
said
one
he
gets
it
from
paris
and
froidfond
and
holland
said
another
he
ll
end
by
buying
up
saumur
cried
a
third
he
doesn
t
mind
the
cold
he
s
so
wrapped
up
in
his
gains
said
a
wife
to
her
husband
hey
hey
monsieur
grandet
if
that
s
too
heavy
for
you
said
a
his
nearest
neighbor
i
ll
take
it
off
your
heavy
said
the
cooper
i
should
think
so
it
s
all
sous
silver
sous
said
the
porter
in
a
low
voice
if
you
want
me
to
take
care
of
you
keep
your
tongue
between
your
teeth
said
the
goodman
to
the
porter
as
they
reached
the
door
the
old
fox
i
thought
he
was
deaf
seems
he
can
hear
fast
enough
in
frosty
here
s
twenty
sous
for
your
new
year
and
said
grandet
be
off
with
you
nanon
shall
take
back
your
barrow
nanon
are
the
linnets
at
church
yes
then
lend
a
hand
go
to
work
he
cried
piling
the
sacks
upon
her
in
a
few
moments
all
were
carried
up
to
his
inner
room
where
he
shut
himself
in
with
them
when
breakfast
is
ready
knock
on
the
wall
he
said
as
he
disappeared
take
the
barrow
back
to
the
the
family
did
not
breakfast
that
day
until
ten
o
clock
your
father
will
not
ask
to
see
your
gold
downstairs
said
madame
grandet
as
they
got
back
from
mass
you
must
pretend
to
be
very
chilly
we
may
have
time
to
replace
the
treasure
before
your
grandet
came
down
the
staircase
thinking
of
his
splendid
speculation
in
government
securities
and
wondering
how
he
could
metamorphose
his
parisian
silver
into
solid
gold
he
was
making
up
his
mind
to
invest
in
this
way
everything
he
could
lay
hands
on
until
the
funds
should
reach
a
par
value
fatal
reverie
for
eugenie
as
soon
as
he
came
in
the
two
women
wished
him
a
happy
new
year
his
daughter
by
putting
her
arms
round
his
neck
and
caressing
him
madame
grandet
gravely
and
with
dignity
ha
ha
my
child
he
said
kissing
his
daughter
on
both
cheeks
i
work
for
you
don
t
you
see
i
think
of
your
happiness
must
have
money
to
be
happy
without
money
there
s
not
a
particle
of
happiness
here
there
s
a
new
napoleon
for
you
i
sent
to
paris
for
it
on
my
word
of
honor
it
s
all
the
gold
i
have
you
are
the
only
one
that
has
got
any
gold
i
want
to
see
your
gold
little
oh
it
is
too
cold
let
us
have
breakfast
answered
eugenie
well
after
breakfast
then
it
will
help
the
digestion
that
fat
des
grassins
sent
me
the
pate
eat
as
much
as
you
like
my
children
it
costs
nothing
des
grassins
is
getting
along
very
well
i
am
satisfied
with
him
the
old
fish
is
doing
charles
a
good
service
and
gratis
too
he
is
making
a
very
good
settlement
of
that
poor
deceased
grandet
s
business
hoo
hoo
he
muttered
with
his
mouth
full
after
a
pause
how
good
it
is
eat
some
wife
that
will
feed
you
for
at
least
two
i
am
not
hungry
i
am
very
poorly

ah
bah

can
stuff
yourself
as
full
as
you
please
without
danger
you
re
a
bertelliere
they
are
all
hearty
you
are
a
bit
yellow
that
s
true
but
i
like
yellow
the
expectation
of
ignominious
and
public
death
is
perhaps
less
horrible
to
a
condemned
criminal
than
the
anticipation
of
what
was
coming
after
breakfast
to
madame
grandet
and
eugenie
the
more
gleefully
the
old
man
talked
and
ate
the
more
their
hearts
shrank
within
them
the
daughter
however
had
an
inward
prop
at
this
crisis
she
gathered
strength
through
love
for
him
for
him
she
cried
within
her
i
would
die
a
thousand
at
this
thought
she
shot
a
glance
at
her
mother
which
flamed
with
courage
clear
away
said
grandet
to
nanon
when
about
eleven
o
clock
breakfast
was
over
but

the
table

eugenie
rose
but
after
making
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
she
turned
abruptly
looked
her
father
in
the
face
and
said
i
have
not
got
you
have
not
got
your
gold
cried
grandet
starting
up
erect
like
a
horse
that
hears
a
cannon
fired
beside
him
no
i
have
not
got
you
are
mistaken
by
the
shears
of
my
father
whenever
the
old
man
swore
that
oath
the
rafters
trembled
holy
virgin
madame

turning
pale
cried
nanon
grandet
your
anger

me
said
the
poor
mother
ta

ta
nonsense

die
in
your
family
eugenie
what
have
you
done
with
your
gold
he
cried
rushing
upon
her
monsieur
said
the
daughter
falling
at
madame
grandet
s
knees
my
mother
is
look
at
her
do

grandet
was
frightened
by
the
pallor
which
overspread
his
wife
s
face
usually
so
yellow
nanon
help
me
to
bed
said
the
poor
woman
in
a
feeble
voice
i
am
dying
nanon
gave
her
mistress
an
arm
eugenie
gave
her
another
but
it
was
only
with
infinite
difficulty
that
they
could
get
her
upstairs
she
fell
with
exhaustion
at
every
step
grandet
remained
alone
however
in
a
few
moments
he
went
up
six
or
eight
stairs
and
called
out
eugenie
when
your
mother
is
in
bed
come
yes
she
soon
came
after
reassuring
her
mother
my
daughter
said
grandet
you
will
now
tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
your
my
father
if

me
presents
of
which

them
back
she
answered
coldly
picking
up
the
napoleon
from
the
and
offering
it
to
him
grandet
seized
the
coin
and
slipped
it
into
his
breeches
pocket
i
shall
certainly
never
give
you
anything
again
not
so
much
as
that
he
said
clicking
his
against
a
front
tooth
do
you
dare
to
despise
your
father
have
you
no
confidence
in
him
don
t
you
know
what
a
father
is
if
he
is
nothing
for
you
he
is
nothing
at
all
where
is
your
gold
father
i
love
and
respect
you
in
spite
of
your
anger
but
i
humbly
ask
you
to
remember
that
i
am
years
old
you
have
told
me
often
that
i
have
attained
my
majority
and
i
do
not
forget
it
i
have
used
my
money
as
i
chose
to
use
it
and
you
may
be
sure
that
it
was
put
to
a
good
use
what
use
that
is
an
inviolable
secret
she
answered
have
you
no
secrets
i
am
the
head
of
the
family
i
have
my
own
and
this
is
it
must
be
something
bad
if
you
can
t
tell
it
to
your
father
mademoiselle
it
is
good
and
i
can
not
tell
it
to
my
at
least
you
can
tell
me
when
you
parted
with
your
gold
eugenie
made
a
negative
motion
with
her
head
you
had
it
on
your
birthday
hein
she
grew
as
crafty
through
love
as
her
father
was
through
avarice
and
reiterated
the
negative
sign
was
there
ever
such
obstinacy
it
s
a
theft
cried
grandet
his
voice
going
up
in
a
crescendo
which
gradually
echoed
through
the
house
what
here
in
my
own
home
under
my
very
eyes
somebody
has
taken
your
gold
the
only
gold
we
have
and
i
m
not
to
know
who
has
got
it
gold
is
a
precious
thing
virtuous
girls
go
wrong
sometimes
and
give
i
don
t
know
what
they
do
it
among
the
great
people
and
even
among
the
bourgeoisie
but
give
their
gold
for
you
have
given
it
to
some
one
hein
eugenie
was
silent
and
impassive
was
there
ever
such
a
daughter
is
it
possible
that
i
am
your
father
if
you
have
invested
it
anywhere
you
must
have
a
receipt
was
i
free
yes
or
no
to
do
what
i
would
with
my
own
was
it
not
mine
you
are
a
of
dumbfounded
by
his
daughter
s
logic
grandet
turned
pale
and
stamped
and
swore
when
at
last
he
found
words
he
cried
serpent
cursed
girl
ah
deceitful
creature
you
know
i
love
you
and
you
take
advantage
of
it
she
d
cut
her
father
s
throat

the
shears
of
my
father

disinherit
you
but

do
you
hear
if
it
was
to
charles
but
no
it
s
impossible
what
has
that
wretched
fellow
robbed
me
he
looked
at
his
daughter
who
continued
cold
and
silent
she
won
t
stir
she
won
t
flinch
she
s
more
grandet
than
i
m
grandet
ha
you
have
not
given
your
gold
for
nothing
come
speak
the
truth
eugenie
looked
at
her
father
with
a
sarcastic
expression
that
stung
him
eugenie
you
are
here
in
my
house
in
your
father
s
house
if
you
wish
to
stay
here
you
must
submit

me

priests

head

you
permission

leave

nanon

bring
you
bread
and
water
you
hear
me
go
eugenie
burst
into
tears
and
fled
up
to
her
mother
grandet
after
marching
two
or
three
times
round
the
garden
in
the
snow
without
heeding
the
cold
suddenly
suspected
that
his
daughter
had
gone
to
her
mother
only
too
happy
to
find
her
disobedient
to
his
orders
he
climbed
the
stairs
with
the
agility
of
a
cat
and
appeared
in
madame
grandet
s
room
just
as
she
was
stroking
eugenie
s
hair
while
the
girl
s
face
was
hidden
in
her
motherly
bosom
be
comforted
my
poor
child
she
was
saying
your
father
will
get
over
she
has
no
father
said
the
old
man
can
it
be
you
and
i
madame
grandet
who
have
given
birth
to
such
a
disobedient
child
a
fine
education
religious
too
well
why
are
you
not
in
your
chamber
come
to
prison
to
prison
mademoiselle
would
you
deprive
me
of
my
daughter
monsieur
said
madame
grandet
turning
towards
him
a
face
that
was
now
red
with
fever
if
you
want
to
keep
her
carry
her
off
clear
out
out
of
my
house
both
of
you
thunder
where
is
the
gold
what
s
become
of
the
gold
eugenie
rose
looked
proudly
at
her
father
and
withdrew
to
her
room
grandet
turned
the
key
of
the
door
nanon
he
cried
put
out
the
fire
in
the
then
he
sat
down
in
an
armchair
beside
his
wife
s
fire
and
said
to
her
undoubtedly
she
has
given
the
gold
to
that
miserable
seducer
charles
who
only
wanted
our
i
knew
nothing
about
it
she
answered
turning
to
the
other
side
of
the
bed
that
she
might
escape
the
savage
glances
of
her
husband
i
suffer
so
much
from
your
violence
that
i
shall
never
leave
this
room
if
i
trust
my
own
presentiments
till
i
am
carried
out
of
it
in
my
coffin
you
ought
to
have
spared
me
this
suffering
monsieur
you
to
whom
i
have
caused
no
pain
that
is
i
think
so
your
daughter
loves
you
i
believe
her
to
be
as
innocent
as
the
babe
unborn
do
not
make
her
wretched
revoke
your
sentence
the
cold
is
very
severe
you
may
give
her
some
serious
i
will
not
see
her
neither
will
i
speak
to
her
she
shall
stay
in
her
room
on
bread
and
water
until
she
submits
to
her
father
what
the
devil
shouldn
t
a
father
know
where
the
gold
in
his
house
has
gone
to
she
owned
the
only
rupees
in
france
perhaps
and
the
dutch
ducats
and
the
monsieur
eugenie
is
our
only
child
and
even
if
she
had
thrown
them
into
the
water
into
the
water
cried
her
husband
into
the
water
you
are
crazy
madame
grandet
what
i
have
said
is
said
you
know
that
well
enough
if
you
want
peace
in
this
household
make
your
daughter
confess
pump
it
out
of
her
women
understand
how
to
do
that
better
than
we
do
whatever
she
has
done
i
sha
n
t
eat
her
is
she
afraid
of
me
even
if
she
has
plastered
charles
with
gold
from
head
to
foot
he
is
on
the
high
seas
and
nobody
can
get
at
him
hein
but
monsieur
excited
by
the
nervous
crisis
through
which
she
had
passed
and
by
the
fate
of
her
daughter
which
brought
forth
all
her
tenderness
and
all
her
powers
of
mind
madame
grandet
suddenly
observed
a
frightful
movement
of
her
husband
s
wen
and
in
the
very
act
of
replying
she
changed
her
speech
without
changing
the
tones
of
her
voice
but
monsieur
i
have
not
more
influence
over
her
than
you
have
she
has
said
nothing
to
me
she
takes
after
tut
tut
your
tongue
is
hung
in
the
middle
this
morning
ta
ta
ta
ta
you
are
setting
me
at
defiance
i
do
believe
i
daresay
you
are
in
league
with
he
looked
fixedly
at
his
wife
monsieur
grandet
if
you
wish
to
kill
me
you
have
only
to
go
on
like
this
i
tell
you
monsieur
and
if
it
were
to
cost
me
my
life
i
would
say
it
you
do
wrong
by
your
daughter
she
is
more
in
the
right
than
you
are
that
money
belonged
to
her
she
is
incapable
of
making
any
but
a
good
use
of
it
and
god
alone
has
the
right
to
know
our
good
deeds
monsieur
i
implore
you
take
eugenie
back
into
favor
forgive
her
if
you
will
do
this
you
will
lessen
the
injury
your
anger
has
done
me
perhaps
you
will
save
my
life
my
daughter
oh
monsieur
give
me
back
my
daughter
i
shall
decamp
he
said
the
house
is
not
habitable
a
mother
and
daughter
talking
and
arguing
like
that
broooouh
pouah
a
fine
new
year
s
present
you
ve
made
me
eugenie
he
called
out
yes
yes
cry
away
what
you
ve
done
will
bring
you
remorse
do
you
hear
what
s
the
good
of
taking
the
sacrament
six
times
every
three
months
if
you
give
away
your
father
s
gold
secretly
to
an
idle
fellow
who
ll
eat
your
heart
out
when
you
ve
nothing
else
to
give
him
you
ll
find
out
some
day
what
your
charles
is
worth
with
his
morocco
boots
and
supercilious
airs
he
has
got
neither
heart
nor
soul
if
he
dared
to
carry
off
a
young
girl
s
treasure
without
the
consent
of
her
when
the
was
shut
eugenie
came
out
of
her
room
and
went
to
her
mother
what
courage
you
have
had
for
your
daughter
s
sake
she
said
ah
my
child
see
where
forbidden
things
may
lead
us
you
forced
me
to
tell
a
i
will
ask
god
to
punish
only
is
it
true
cried
nanon
rushing
in
alarmed
that
mademoiselle
is
to
be
kept
on
bread
and
water
for
the
rest
of
her
life
what
does
that
signify
nanon
said
eugenie
tranquilly
goodness
do
you
suppose
i
ll
eat
when
the
daughter
of
the
house
is
eating
dry
bread
no
no
don
t
say
a
word
about
all
this
nanon
said
eugenie
i
ll
be
as
mute
as
a
fish
but
you
ll
see
grandet
dined
alone
for
the
first
time
in
years
so
you
re
a
widower
monsieur
said
nanon
it
must
be
disagreeable
to
be
a
widower
with
two
women
in
the
i
did
not
speak
to
you
hold
your
jaw
or
i
ll
turn
you
off
what

boiling
in
your
saucepan
on
the
stove
it
is
grease
i

trying
there
will
be
some
company
light
the
the
cruchots
madame
des
grassins
and
her
son
arrived
at
the
usual
hour
of
eight
and
were
surprised
to
see
neither
madame
grandet
nor
her
daughter
my
wife
is
not
very
well
and
eugenie
is
with
her
said
the
old
whose
face
betrayed
no
emotion
at
the
end
of
an
hour
spent
in
idle
conversation
madame
des
grassins
who
had
gone
up
to
see
madame
grandet
came
down
and
every
one
inquired
how
is
madame
grandet
not
at
all
well
she
answered
her
condition
seems
to
me
really
alarming
at
her
age
you
ought
to
take
every
precaution
papa
we
ll
see
about
it
said
the
old
man
in
an
absent
way
they
all
wished
him
when
the
cruchots
got
into
the
street
madame
des
grassins
said
to
them
there
is
something
going
on
at
the
grandets
the
mother
is
very
ill
without
her
knowing
it
the
girl
s
eyes
are
red
as
if
she
had
been
crying
all
day
can
they
be
trying
to
marry
her
against
her
will
when
grandet
had
gone
to
bed
nanon
came
softly
to
eugenie
s
room
in
her
stockinged
feet
and
showed
her
a
pate
baked
in
a
saucepan
see
mademoiselle
said
the
good
soul
cornoiller
gave
me
a
hare
you
eat
so
little
that
this
pate
will
last
you
full
a
week
in
such
frosty
weather
it
won
t
spoil
you
sha
n
t
live
on
dry
bread
i
m
determined
it
isn
t
poor
nanon
said
eugenie
pressing
her
hand
i
ve
made
it
downright
good
and
dainty
and
never
found
it
out
i
bought
the
lard
and
the
spices
out
of
my
six
francs
i
m
the
mistress
of
my
own
money
and
she
disappeared
rapidly
fancying
she
heard
grandet
xi
for
several
months
the
old
came
constantly
to
his
wife
s
room
at
all
hours
of
the
day
without
ever
uttering
his
daughter
s
name
or
seeing
her
or
making
the
smallest
allusion
to
her
madame
grandet
did
not
leave
her
chamber
and
daily
grew
worse
nothing
softened
the
old
man
he
remained
unmoved
harsh
and
cold
as
a
granite
rock
he
continued
to
go
and
come
about
his
business
as
usual
but
ceased
to
stutter
talked
less
and
was
more
obdurate
in
business
transactions
than
ever
before
often
he
made
mistakes
in
adding
up
his
figures
something
is
going
on
at
the
grandets
said
the
grassinists
and
the
cruchotines
what
has
happened
in
the
grandet
family
became
a
fixed
question
which
everybody
asked
everybody
else
at
the
little
of
saumur
eugenie
went
to
mass
escorted
by
nanon
if
madame
des
grassins
said
a
few
words
to
her
on
coming
out
of
church
she
answered
in
an
evasive
manner
without
satisfying
any
curiosity
however
at
the
end
of
two
months
it
became
impossible
to
hide
either
from
the
three
cruchots
or
from
madame
des
grassins
the
fact
that
eugenie
was
in
confinement
there
came
a
moment
when
all
pretexts
failed
to
explain
her
perpetual
absence
then
though
it
was
impossible
to
discover
by
whom
the
secret
had
been
betrayed
all
the
town
became
aware
that
ever
since
new
year
s
day
mademoiselle
grandet
had
been
kept
in
her
room
without
fire
on
bread
and
water
by
her
father
s
orders
and
that
nanon
cooked
little
dainties
and
took
them
to
her
secretly
at
night
it
was
even
known
that
the
young
woman
was
not
able
to
see
or
take
care
of
her
mother
except
at
certain
times
when
her
father
was
out
of
the
house
grandet
s
conduct
was
severely
condemned
the
whole
town
outlawed
him
so
to
speak
they
remembered
his
treachery
his
and
they
excommunicated
him
when
he
passed
along
the
streets
people
pointed
him
out
and
muttered
at
him
when
his
daughter
came
down
the
winding
street
accompanied
by
nanon
on
her
way
to
mass
or
vespers
the
inhabitants
ran
to
the
windows
and
examined
with
intense
curiosity
the
bearing
of
the
rich
heiress
and
her
countenance
which
bore
the
impress
of
angelic
gentleness
and
melancholy
her
imprisonment
and
the
condemnation
of
her
father
were
as
nothing
to
her
had
she
not
a
map
of
the
world
the
little
bench
the
garden
the
angle
of
the
wall
did
she
not
taste
upon
her
lips
the
honey
that
love
s
kisses
left
there
she
was
ignorant
for
a
time
that
the
town
talked
about
her
just
as
grandet
himself
was
ignorant
of
it
pious
and
pure
in
heart
before
god
her
conscience
and
her
love
helped
her
to
suffer
patiently
the
wrath
and
vengeance
of
her
father
one
deep
grief
silenced
all
others
her
mother
that
gentle
tender
creature
made
beautiful
by
the
light
which
shone
from
the
inner
to
the
outer
as
she
approached
the
tomb
her
mother
was
perishing
from
day
to
day
eugenie
often
reproached
herself
as
the
innocent
cause
of
the
slow
cruel
malady
that
was
wasting
her
away
this
remorse
though
her
mother
soothed
it
bound
her
still
closer
to
her
love
every
morning
as
soon
as
her
father
left
the
house
she
went
to
the
bedside
of
her
mother
and
there
nanon
brought
her
breakfast
the
poor
girl
sad
and
suffering
through
the
sufferings
of
her
mother
would
turn
her
face
to
the
old
servant
with
a
mute
gesture
weeping
and
yet
not
daring
to
speak
of
her
cousin
it
was
madame
grandet
who
first
found
courage
to
say
where
is
why
does
not
write
let
us
think
about
him
mother
but
not
speak
of
him
you
are
ill
you
before
all
meant
my
child
said
madame
grandet
i
do
not
wish
to
live
god
protects
me
and
enables
me
to
look
with
joy
to
the
end
of
my
every
utterance
of
this
woman
was
unfalteringly
pious
and
christian
sometimes
during
the
first
months
of
the
year
when
her
husband
came
to
breakfast
with
her
and
tramped
up
and
down
the
room
she
would
say
to
him
a
few
religious
words
always
spoken
with
angelic
sweetness
yet
with
the
firmness
of
a
woman
to
whom
approaching
death
lends
a
courage
she
had
lacked
in
life
monsieur
i
thank
you
for
the
interest
you
take
in
my
health
she
would
answer
when
he
made
some
commonplace
inquiry
but
if
you
really
desire
to
render
my
last
moments
less
bitter
and
to
ease
my
grief
take
back
your
daughter
be
a
christian
a
husband
and
a
when
he
heard
these
words
grandet
would
sit
down
by
the
bed
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
sees
the
rain
coming
and
quietly
gets
under
the
shelter
of
a
gateway
till
it
is
over
when
these
touching
tender
and
religious
supplications
had
all
been
made
he
would
say
you
are
rather
pale
my
poor
absolute
forgetfulness
of
his
daughter
seemed
graven
on
his
stony
brow
on
his
closed
lips
he
was
unmoved
by
the
tears
which
flowed
down
the
white
cheeks
of
his
unhappy
wife
as
she
listened
to
his
meaningless
answers
may
god
pardon
you
she
said
even
as
i
pardon
you
you
will
some
day
stand
in
need
of
since
madame
grandet
s
illness
he
had
not
dared
to
make
use
of
his
terrible
ta
ta
ta
ta
yet
for
all
that
his
despotic
nature
was
not
disarmed
by
this
angel
of
gentleness
whose
ugliness
day
by
day
decreased
driven
out
by
the
ineffable
expression
of
moral
qualities
which
shone
upon
her
face
she
was
all
soul
the
spirit
of
prayer
seemed
to
purify
her
and
refine
those
homely
features
and
make
them
luminous
who
has
not
seen
the
phenomenon
of
a
like
transfiguration
on
sacred
faces
where
the
habits
of
the
soul
have
triumphed
over
the
plainest
features
giving
them
that
spiritual
illumination
whose
light
comes
from
the
purity
and
nobility
of
the
inward
thought
the
spectacle
of
this
transformation
wrought
by
the
struggle
which
consumed
the
last
shreds
of
the
human
life
of
this
woman
did
somewhat
affect
the
old
cooper
though
feebly
for
his
nature
was
of
iron
if
his
language
ceased
to
be
contemptuous
an
imperturbable
silence
which
saved
his
dignity
as
master
of
the
household
took
its
place
and
ruled
his
conduct
when
the
faithful
nanon
appeared
in
the
market
many
quips
and
quirks
and
complaints
about
the
master
whistled
in
her
ears
but
however
loudly
public
opinion
condemned
monsieur
grandet
the
old
servant
defended
him
for
the
honor
of
the
family
well
she
would
say
to
his
detractors
don
t
we
all
get
hard
as
we
grow
old
why
shouldn
t
he
get
horny
too
stop
telling
lies
mademoiselle
lives
like
a
queen
she
s
alone
that
s
true
but
she
likes
it
besides
my
masters
have
good
at
last
towards
the
end
of
spring
madame
grandet
worn
out
by
grief
even
more
than
by
illness
having
failed
in
spite
of
her
prayers
to
reconcile
the
father
and
daughter
confided
her
secret
troubles
to
the
cruchots
keep
a
girl
of
on
bread
and
water
cried
monsieur
de
bonfons
without
any
reason
too
why
that
constitutes
wrongful
cruelty
she
can
contest
as
much
in
as
upon
come
nephew
spare
us
your
legal
jargon
said
the
notary
set
your
mind
at
ease
madame
i
will
put
a
stop
to
such
treatment
eugenie
hearing
herself
mentioned
came
out
of
her
room
gentlemen
she
said
coming
forward
with
a
proud
step
i
beg
you
not
to
interfere
in
this
matter
my
father
is
master
in
his
own
house
as
long
as
i
live
under
his
roof
i
am
bound
to
obey
him
his
conduct
is
not
subject
to
the
approbation
or
the
disapprobation
of
the
world
he
is
accountable
to
god
only
i
appeal
to
your
friendship
to
keep
total
silence
in
this
affair
to
blame
my
father
is
to
attack
our
family
honor
i
am
much
obliged
to
you
for
the
interest
you
have
shown
in
me
you
will
do
me
an
additional
service
if
you
will
put
a
stop
to
the
offensive
rumors
which
are
current
in
the
town
of
which
i
am
accidentally
she
is
right
said
madame
grandet
mademoiselle
the
best
way
to
stop
such
rumors
is
to
procure
your
liberty
answered
the
old
notary
respectfully
struck
with
the
beauty
which
seclusion
melancholy
and
love
had
stamped
upon
her
face
well
my
daughter
let
monsieur
cruchot
manage
the
matter
if
he
is
so
sure
of
success
he
understands
your
father
and
how
to
manage
him
if
you
wish
to
see
me
happy
for
my
few
remaining
days
you
must
at
any
cost
be
reconciled
to
your
on
the
morrow
grandet
in
pursuance
of
a
custom
he
had
begun
since
eugenie
s
imprisonment
took
a
certain
number
of
turns
up
and
down
the
little
garden
he
had
chosen
the
hour
when
eugenie
brushed
and
arranged
her
hair
when
the
old
man
reached
the
he
hid
behind
its
trunk
and
remained
for
a
few
moments
watching
his
daughter
s
movements
hesitating
perhaps
between
the
course
to
which
the
obstinacy
of
his
character
impelled
him
and
his
natural
desire
to
embrace
his
child
sometimes
he
sat
down
on
the
rotten
old
bench
where
charles
and
eugenie
had
vowed
eternal
love
and
then
she
too
looked
at
her
father
secretly
in
the
mirror
before
which
she
stood
if
he
rose
and
continued
his
walk
she
sat
down
obligingly
at
the
window
and
looked
at
the
angle
of
the
wall
where
the
pale
flowers
hung
where
the
grew
from
the
crevices
with
the
bindweed
and
the
sedum
a
white
or
yellow
very
abundant
in
the
vineyards
of
saumur
and
at
tours
maitre
cruchot
came
early
and
found
the
old
sitting
in
the
fine
june
weather
on
the
little
bench
his
back
against
the
division
wall
of
the
garden
engaged
in
watching
his
daughter
what
may
you
want
maitre
cruchot
he
said
perceiving
the
notary
i
came
to
speak
to
you
on
ah
ah
have
you
brought
some
gold
in
exchange
for
my
silver
no
no
i
have
not
come
about
money
it
is
about
your
daughter
eugenie
all
the
town
is
talking
of
her
and
what
does
the
town
meddle
for
a
man
s
house
is
his
very
true
and
a
man
may
kill
himself
if
he
likes
or
what
is
worse
he
may
fling
his
money
into
the
what
do
you
mean
why
your
wife
is
very
ill
my
friend
you
ought
to
consult
monsieur
bergerin
she
is
likely
to
die
if
she
does
die
without
receiving
proper
care
you
will
not
be
very
easy
in
mind
i
take
ta
ta
ta
ta
you
know
a
deal
about
my
wife
these
doctors
if
they
once
get
their
foot
in
your
house
will
come
five
and
six
times
a
of
course
you
will
do
as
you
think
best
we
are
old
friends
there
is
no
one
in
all
saumur
who
takes
more
interest
than
i
in
what
concerns
you
therefore
i
was
bound
to
tell
you
this
however
happen
what
may
you
have
the
right
to
do
as
you
please
you
can
choose
your
own
course
besides
that
is
not
what
brings
me
here
there
is
another
thing
which
may
have
serious
results
for
you
after
all
you
can
t
wish
to
kill
your
wife
her
life
is
too
important
to
you
think
of
your
situation
in
connection
with
your
daughter
if
madame
grandet
dies
you
must
render
an
account
to
eugenie
because
you
enjoy
your
wife
s
estate
only
during
her
lifetime
at
her
death
your
daughter
can
claim
a
division
of
property
and
she
may
force
you
to
sell
froidfond
in
short
she
is
her
mother
s
heir
and
you
are
these
words
fell
like
a
thunderbolt
on
the
old
man
who
was
not
as
wise
about
law
as
he
was
about
business
he
had
never
thought
of
a
legal
division
of
the
estate
therefore
i
advise
you
to
treat
her
kindly
added
cruchot
in
conclusion
but
do
you
know
what
she
has
done
cruchot
what
asked
the
notary
curious
to
hear
the
truth
and
find
out
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
she
has
given
away
her
gold
well
wasn
t
it
hers
said
the
notary
they
all
tell
me
that
exclaimed
the
old
man
letting
his
arms
fall
to
his
sides
with
a
movement
that
was
truly
tragic
are
you
going
for
a
mere
nothing
resumed
cruchot
to
put
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
concessions
which
you
will
be
obliged
to
ask
from
your
daughter
as
soon
as
her
mother
dies
do
you
call
six
thousand
francs
a
mere
nothing
hey
my
old
friend
do
you
know
what
the
inventory
of
your
wife
s
property
will
cost
if
eugenie
demands
the
division
how
much
two
three
four
thousand
francs
perhaps
the
property
would
have
to
be
put
up
at
auction
and
sold
to
get
at
its
actual
value
instead
of
that
if
you
are
on
good
terms
with
by
the
shears
of
my
father
cried
grandet
turning
pale
as
he
suddenly
sat
down
we
will
see
about
it
after
a
moment
s
silence
full
of
anguish
perhaps
the
old
man
looked
at
the
notary
and
said
life
is
very
hard
it
has
many
griefs
cruchot
he
continued
solemnly
you
would
not
deceive
me
swear
to
me
upon
your
honor
that
all
you
ve
told
me
is
legally
true
show
me
the
law
i
must
see
the
law
my
poor
friend
said
the
notary
don
t
i
know
my
own
business
then
it
is
true
i
am
robbed
betrayed
killed
destroyed
by
my
own
daughter
it
is
true
that
your
daughter
is
her
mother
s
why
do
we
have
children
ah
my
wife
i
love
her
luckily
she
s
sound
and
healthy
she
s
a
she
has
not
a
month
to
grandet
struck
his
forehead
went
a
few
steps
came
back
cast
a
dreadful
look
on
cruchot
and
said
what
can
be
done
eugenie
can
relinquish
her
claim
to
her
mother
s
property
should
she
do
this
you
would
not
disinherit
her
i
presume
but
if
you
want
to
come
to
such
a
settlement
you
must
not
treat
her
harshly
what
i
am
telling
you
old
man
is
against
my
own
interests
what
do
i
live
by
if
it
isn
t
liquidations
inventories
conveyances
divisions
of
property
we
ll
see
we
ll
see
don
t
let
s
talk
any
more
about
it
cruchot
it
wrings
my
vitals
have
you
received
any
gold
no
but
i
have
a
few
old
louis
a
dozen
or
so
which
you
may
have
my
good
friend
make
it
up
with
eugenie
don
t
you
know
all
saumur
is
pelting
you
with
stones
the
scoundrels
come
the
funds
are
at
do
be
satisfied
for
once
in
your
at
are
they
cruchot
hey
hey
repeated
the
old
man
accompanying
the
notary
to
the
then
too
agitated
by
what
he
had
just
heard
to
stay
in
the
house
he
went
up
to
his
wife
s
room
and
said
come
mother
you
may
have
your
daughter
to
spend
the
day
with
you
i
m
going
to
froidfond
enjoy
yourselves
both
of
you
this
is
our
wife
see
here
are
sixty
francs
for
your
altar
at
the
you
ve
wanted
one
for
a
long
time
come
cheer
up
enjoy
yourself
and
get
well
hurrah
for
happiness
he
threw
ten
silver
pieces
of
six
francs
each
upon
the
bed
and
took
his
wife
s
head
between
his
hands
and
kissed
her
forehead
my
good
wife
you
are
getting
well
are
not
you
how
can
you
think
of
receiving
the
god
of
mercy
in
your
house
when
you
refuse
to
forgive
your
daughter
she
said
with
emotion
ta
ta
ta
ta
said
grandet
in
a
coaxing
voice
we
ll
see
about
merciful
heaven
eugenie
cried
the
mother
flushing
with
joy
come
and
kiss
your
father
he
forgives
you
but
the
old
man
had
disappeared
he
was
going
as
fast
as
his
legs
could
carry
him
towards
his
vineyards
trying
to
get
his
confused
ideas
into
order
grandet
had
entered
his
year
during
the
last
two
years
his
avarice
had
increased
upon
him
as
all
the
persistent
passions
of
men
increase
at
a
certain
age
as
if
to
illustrate
an
observation
which
applies
equally
to
misers
ambitious
men
and
others
whose
lives
are
controlled
by
any
dominant
idea
his
affections
had
fastened
upon
one
special
symbol
of
his
passion
the
sight
of
gold
the
possession
of
gold
had
become
a
monomania
his
despotic
spirit
had
grown
in
proportion
to
his
avarice
and
to
part
with
the
control
of
the
smallest
fraction
of
his
property
at
the
death
of
his
wife
seemed
to
him
a
thing
against
to
declare
his
fortune
to
his
daughter
to
give
an
inventory
of
his
property
landed
and
personal
for
the
purposes
of
division
why
he
cried
aloud
in
the
midst
of
a
field
where
he
was
pretending
to
examine
a
vine
it
would
be
cutting
my
throat
he
came
at
last
to
a
decision
and
returned
to
saumur
in
time
for
dinner
resolved
to
unbend
to
eugenie
and
pet
and
coax
her
that
he
might
die
regally
holding
the
reins
of
his
millions
in
his
own
hands
so
long
as
the
breath
was
in
his
body
at
the
moment
when
the
old
man
who
chanced
to
have
his
in
his
pocket
opened
the
door
and
climbed
with
a
stealthy
step
up
the
stairway
to
go
into
his
wife
s
room
eugenie
had
brought
the
beautiful
from
the
oak
cabinet
and
placed
it
on
her
mother
s
bed
mother
and
daughter
in
grandet
s
absence
allowed
themselves
the
pleasure
of
looking
for
a
likeness
to
charles
in
the
portrait
of
his
mother
it
is
exactly
his
forehead
and
his
mouth
eugenie
was
saying
as
the
old
man
opened
the
door
at
the
look
which
her
husband
cast
upon
the
gold
madame
grandet
cried
out
o
god
have
pity
upon
us
the
old
man
sprang
upon
the
box
as
a
famished
tiger
might
spring
upon
a
sleeping
child
what
s
this
he
said
snatching
the
treasure
and
carrying
it
to
the
window
gold
good
gold
he
cried
all
gold
it
weighs
two
pounds
ha
ha
charles
gave
you
that
for
your
money
did
he
hein
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
so
it
was
a
good
bargain
little
one
yes
you
are
my
daughter
i
see
that
eugenie
trembled
in
every
limb
this
came
from
charles
of
course
didn
t
it
continued
the
old
man
yes
father
it
is
not
mine
it
is
a
sacred
ta
ta
ta
ta
he
took
your
fortune
and
now
you
can
get
it
father
grandet
took
his
knife
to
pry
out
some
of
the
gold
to
do
this
he
placed
the
on
a
chair
eugenie
sprang
forward
to
recover
it
but
her
father
who
had
his
eye
on
her
and
on
the
treasure
too
pushed
her
back
so
violently
with
a
thrust
of
his
arm
that
she
fell
upon
her
mother
s
bed
monsieur
monsieur
cried
the
mother
lifting
herself
up
grandet
had
opened
his
knife
and
was
about
to
apply
it
to
the
gold
father
cried
eugenie
falling
on
her
knees
and
dragging
herself
close
to
him
with
clasped
hands
father
in
the
name
of
all
the
saints
and
the
virgin
in
the
name
of
christ
who
died
upon
the
cross
in
the
name
of
your
eternal
salvation
father
for
my
life
s
sake
father
do
not
touch
that
it
is
neither
yours
nor
mine
it
is
a
trust
placed
in
my
hands
by
an
unhappy
relation
i
must
give
it
back
to
him
uninjured
if
it
is
a
trust
why
were
you
looking
at
it
to
look
at
it
is
as
bad
as
touching
father
don
t
destroy
it
or
you
will
disgrace
me
father
do
you
hear
oh
have
pity
said
the
mother
father
cried
eugenie
in
so
startling
a
voice
that
nanon
ran
upstairs
terrified
eugenie
sprang
upon
a
knife
that
was
close
at
hand
well
what
now
said
grandet
coldly
with
a
callous
smile
oh
you
are

he
added
pointing
to

case

i
shall

of
it
again
never
monsieur
bergerin
the
celebrated
doctor
of
saumur
presently
arrived
after
an
examination
he
told
grandet
positively
that
his
wife
was
very
ill
but
that
perfect
peace
of
mind
a
generous
diet
and
great
care
might
prolong
her
life
until
the
autumn
will
all
that
cost
much
said
the
old
man
will
she
need
medicines
not
much
medicine
but
a
great
deal
of
care
answered
the
doctor
who
could
scarcely
restrain
a
smile
now
monsieur
bergerin
said
grandet
you
are
a
man
of
honor
are
not
you
i
trust
to
you
come
and
see
my
wife
how
and
when
you
think
necessary
save
my
good
wife
i
love
her
don
t
you
see
though
i
never
talk
about
it
i
keep
things
to
myself
i
m
full
of
trouble
troubles
began
when
my
brother
died
i
have
to
spend
enormous
sums
on
his
affairs
in
paris
why
i
m
paying
through
my
nose
there
s
no
end
to
it
adieu
monsieur
if
you
can
save
my
wife
save
her
i
ll
spare
no
expense
not
even
if
it
costs
me
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
in
spite
of
grandet
s
fervent
wishes
for
the
health
of
his
wife
whose
death
threatened
more
than
death
to
him
in
spite
of
the
consideration
he
now
showed
on
all
occasions
for
the
least
wish
of
his
astonished
wife
and
daughter
in
spite
of
the
tender
care
which
eugenie
lavished
upon
her
mother
madame
grandet
rapidly
approached
her
end
every
day
she
grew
weaker
and
wasted
visibly
as
women
of
her
age
when
attacked
by
serious
illness
are
wont
to
do
she
was
fragile
as
the
foliage
in
autumn
the
radiance
of
heaven
shone
through
her
as
the
sun
strikes
athwart
the
withering
leaves
and
gilds
them
it
was
a
death
worthy
of
her
life
a
christian
death
and
is
not
that
sublime
in
the
month
of
october
her
virtues
her
angelic
patience
her
love
for
her
daughter
seemed
to
find
special
expression
and
then
she
passed
away
without
a
murmur
lamb
without
spot
she
went
to
heaven
regretting
only
the
sweet
companion
of
her
cold
and
dreary
life
for
whom
her
last
glance
seemed
to
prophesy
a
destiny
of
sorrows
she
shrank
from
leaving
her
white
as
herself
alone
in
the
midst
of
a
selfish
world
that
sought
to
strip
her
of
her
fleece
and
grasp
her
treasures
my
child
she
said
as
she
expired
there
is
no
happiness
except
in
heaven
you
will
know
it
some
xii
on
the
morrow
of
this
death
eugenie
felt
a
new
motive
for
attachment
to
the
house
in
which
she
was
born
where
she
had
suffered
so
much
where
her
mother
had
just
died
she
could
not
see
the
window
and
the
chair
on
its
castors
without
weeping
she
thought
she
had
mistaken
the
heart
of
her
old
father
when
she
found
herself
the
object
of
his
tenderest
cares
he
came
in
the
morning
and
gave
her
his
arm
to
take
her
to
breakfast
he
looked
at
her
for
hours
together
with
an
eye
that
was
almost
kind
he
brooded
over
her
as
though
she
had
been
gold
the
old
man
was
so
unlike
himself
he
trembled
so
often
before
his
daughter
that
nanon
and
the
cruchotines
who
witnessed
his
weakness
attributed
it
to
his
great
age
and
feared
that
his
faculties
were
giving
away
but
the
day
on
which
the
family
put
on
their
mourning
and
after
dinner
to
which
meal
maitre
cruchot
the
only
person
who
knew
his
secret
had
been
invited
the
conduct
of
the
old
miser
was
explained
my
dear
child
he
said
to
eugenie
when
the
table
had
been
cleared
and
the
doors
carefully
shut
you
are
now
your
mother
s
heiress
and
we
have
a
few
little
matters
to
settle
between
us
isn
t
that
so
cruchot
is
it
necessary
to
talk
of
them
father
yes
yes
little
one
i
can
t
bear
the
uncertainty
in
which
i
m
placed
i
think
you
don
t
want
to
give
me
pain
oh
father
well
then
let
us
settle
it
all
what
is
it
you
wish
me
to
do
my
little
girl
it
is
not
for
me
to
say
tell
her
mademoiselle
your
father
does
not
wish
to
divide
the
property
nor
sell
the
estate
nor
pay
enormous
taxes
on
the
ready
money
which
he
may
possess
therefore
to
avoid
all
this
he
must
be
released
from
making
the
inventory
of
his
whole
fortune
part
of
which
you
inherit
from
your
mother
and
which
is
now
undivided
between
you
and
your
father
cruchot
are
you
quite
sure
of
what
you
are
saying
before
you
tell
it
to
a
mere
child
let
me
tell
it
my
own
way
yes
yes
my
friend
neither
you
nor
my
daughter
wish
to
rob
me
do
you
little
one
but
monsieur
cruchot
what
am
i
to
do
said
eugenie
impatiently
well
said
the
notary
it
is
necessary
to
sign
this
deed
by
which
you
renounce
your
rights
to
your
mother
s
estate
and
leave
your
father
the
use
and
disposition
during
his
lifetime
of
all
the
property
undivided
between
you
of
which
he
guarantees
you
the
i
do
not
understand
a
word
of
what
you
are
saying
returned
eugenie
give
me
the
deed
and
show
me
where
i
am
to
sign
pere
grandet
looked
alternately
at
the
deed
and
at
his
daughter
at
his
daughter
and
at
the
deed
undergoing
as
he
did
so
such
violent
emotion
that
he
wiped
the
sweat
from
his
brow
my
little
girl
he
said
if
instead
of
signing
this
deed
which
will
cost
a
great
deal
to
record
you
would
simply
agree
to
renounce
your
rights
as
heir
to
your
poor
dear
deceased
mother
s
property
and
would
trust
to
me
for
the
future
i
should
like
it
better
in
that
case
i
will
pay
you
monthly
the
good
round
sum
of
a
hundred
francs
see
now
you
could
pay
for
as
many
masses
as
you
want
for
anybody
hein
a
hundred
francs
a
month
in
i
will
do
all
you
wish
mademoiselle
said
the
notary
it
is
my
duty
to
point
out
to
you
that
you
are
despoiling
yourself
without
guarantee
good
heavens
what
is
all
that
to
me
hold
your
tongue
cruchot
it
s
settled
all
settled
cried
grandet
taking
his
daughter
s
hand
and
striking
it
with
his
own
eugenie
you
won
t
go
back
on
your
word
you
are
an
honest
girl
hein
oh
father
he
kissed
her
effusively
and
pressed
her
in
his
arms
till
he
almost
choked
her
go
my
good
child
you
restore
your
father
s
life
but
you
only
return
to
him
that
which
he
gave
you
we
are
quits
this
is
how
business
should
be
done
life
is
a
business
i
bless
you
you
are
a
virtuous
girl
and
you
love
your
father
do
just
what
you
like
in
future
cruchot
he
added
looking
at
the
horrified
notary
you
will
see
about
preparing
the
deed
of
relinquishment
and
then
enter
it
on
the
records
of
the
the
next
morning
eugenie
signed
the
papers
by
which
she
herself
completed
her
spoliation
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
however
in
spite
of
his
bargain
the
old
man
had
not
given
his
daughter
one
sou
of
the
hundred
francs
he
had
so
solemnly
pledged
to
her
when
eugenie
pleasantly
reminded
him
of
this
he
could
not
help
coloring
and
went
hastily
to
his
secret
from
whence
he
brought
down
about
a
third
of
the
jewels
he
had
taken
from
his
nephew
and
gave
them
to
her
there
little
one
he
said
in
a
sarcastic
tone
do
you
want
those
for
your
twelve
hundred
francs
oh
father
truly
will
you
really
give
them
to
me
i
ll
give
you
as
many
more
next
year
he
said
throwing
them
into
her
apron
so
before
long
you
ll
get
all
his
gewgaws
he
added
rubbing
his
hands
delighted
to
be
able
to
speculate
on
his
daughter
s
feelings
nevertheless
the
old
man
though
still
robust
felt
the
importance
of
initiating
his
daughter
into
the
secrets
of
his
thrift
and
its
management
for
two
consecutive
years
he
made
her
order
the
household
meals
in
his
presence
and
receive
the
rents
and
he
taught
her
slowly
and
successively
the
names
and
remunerative
capacity
of
his
vineyards
and
his
farms
about
the
third
year
he
had
so
thoroughly
accustomed
her
to
his
avaricious
methods
that
they
had
turned
into
the
settled
habits
of
her
own
life
and
he
was
able
to
leave
the
household
keys
in
her
charge
without
anxiety
and
to
install
her
as
mistress
of
the
house
five
years
passed
away
without
a
single
event
to
relieve
the
monotonous
existence
of
eugenie
and
her
father
the
same
actions
were
performed
daily
with
the
automatic
regularity
of
clockwork
the
deep
sadness
of
mademoiselle
grandet
was
known
to
every
one
but
if
others
surmised
the
cause
she
herself
never
uttered
a
word
that
justified
the
suspicions
which
all
saumur
entertained
about
the
state
of
the
rich
heiress
s
heart
her
only
society
was
made
up
of
the
three
cruchots
and
a
few
of
their
particular
friends
whom
they
had
little
by
little
introduced
into
the
grandet
household
they
had
taught
her
to
play
whist
and
they
came
every
night
for
their
game
during
the
year
her
father
feeling
the
weight
of
his
infirmities
was
obliged
to
initiate
her
still
further
into
the
secrets
of
his
landed
property
and
told
her
that
in
case
of
difficulty
she
was
to
have
recourse
to
maitre
cruchot
whose
integrity
was
well
known
to
him
towards
the
end
of
this
year
the
old
man
then
was
seized
by
paralysis
which
made
rapid
progress
bergerin
gave
him
up
eugenie
feeling
that
she
was
about
to
be
left
alone
in
the
world
came
as
it
were
nearer
to
her
father
and
clasped
more
tightly
this
last
living
link
of
affection
to
her
mind
as
in
that
of
all
loving
women
love
was
the
whole
of
life
charles
was
not
there
and
she
devoted
all
her
care
and
attention
to
the
old
father
whose
faculties
had
begun
to
weaken
though
his
avarice
remained
instinctively
acute
the
death
of
this
man
offered
no
contrast
to
his
life
in
the
morning
he
made
them
roll
him
to
a
spot
between
the
chimney
of
his
chamber
and
the
door
of
the
secret
room
which
was
filled
no
doubt
with
gold
he
asked
for
an
explanation
of
every
noise
he
heard
even
the
slightest
to
the
great
astonishment
of
the
notary
he
even
heard
the
yawning
in
the
he
woke
up
from
his
apparent
stupor
at
the
day
and
hour
when
the
rents
were
due
or
when
accounts
had
to
be
settled
with
his
and
receipts
given
at
such
times
he
worked
his
chair
forward
on
its
castors
until
he
faced
the
door
of
the
inner
room
he
made
his
daughter
open
it
and
watched
while
she
placed
the
bags
of
money
one
upon
another
in
his
secret
receptacles
and
relocked
the
door
then
she
returned
silently
to
her
seat
after
giving
him
the
key
which
he
replaced
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
and
fingered
from
time
to
time
his
old
friend
the
notary
feeling
sure
that
the
rich
heiress
would
inevitably
marry
his
nephew
the
president
if
charles
grandet
did
not
return
redoubled
all
his
attentions
he
came
every
day
to
take
grandet
s
orders
went
on
his
errands
to
froidfond
to
the
farms
and
the
fields
and
the
vineyards
sold
the
vintages
and
turned
everything
into
gold
and
silver
which
found
their
way
in
sacks
to
the
secret
at
length
the
last
struggle
came
in
which
the
strong
frame
of
the
old
man
slowly
yielded
to
destruction
he
was
determined
to
sit
at
the
facing
the
door
of
the
secret
room
he
drew
off
and
rolled
up
all
the
coverings
which
were
laid
over
him
saying
to
nanon
put
them
away
lock
them
up
for
fear
they
should
be
so
long
as
he
could
open
his
eyes
in
which
his
whole
being
had
now
taken
refuge
he
turned
them
to
the
door
behind
which
lay
his
treasures
saying
to
his
daughter
are
they
there
are
they
there
in
a
tone
of
voice
which
revealed
a
sort
of
panic
fear
yes
my
father
she
would
answer
take
care
of
the
gold
put
gold
before
eugenie
would
then
spread
coins
on
a
table
before
him
and
he
would
sit
for
hours
together
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
them
like
a
child
who
at
the
moment
it
first
begins
to
see
gazes
in
stupid
contemplation
at
the
same
object
and
like
the
child
a
distressful
smile
would
flicker
upon
his
face
it
warms
me
he
would
sometimes
say
as
an
expression
of
beatitude
stole
across
his
features
when
the
cure
of
the
parish
came
to
administer
the
last
sacraments
the
old
man
s
eyes
sightless
apparently
for
some
hours
kindled
at
the
sight
of
the
cross
the
candlesticks
and
the
vessel
of
silver
he
gazed
at
them
fixedly
and
his
wen
moved
for
the
last
time
when
the
priest
put
the
crucifix
of
to
his
lips
that
he
might
kiss
the
christ
he
made
a
frightful
gesture
as
if
to
seize
it
and
that
last
effort
cost
him
his
life
he
called
eugenie
whom
he
did
not
see
though
she
was
kneeling
beside
him
bathing
with
tears
his
stiffening
hand
which
was
already
cold
my
father
bless
me
she
entreated
take
care
of
it
all
you
will
render
me
an
account
yonder
he
said
proving
by
these
last
words
that
christianity
must
always
be
the
religion
of
misers
eugenie
grandet
was
now
alone
in
the
world
in
that
gray
house
with
none
but
nanon
to
whom
she
could
turn
with
the
certainty
of
being
heard
and
understood
nanon
the
sole
being
who
loved
her
for
herself
and
with
whom
she
could
speak
of
her
sorrows
la
grande
nanon
was
a
providence
for
eugenie
she
was
not
a
servant
but
a
humble
friend
after
her
father
s
death
eugenie
learned
from
maitre
cruchot
that
she
possessed
an
income
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
from
landed
and
personal
property
in
the
arrondissement
of
saumur
also
six
millions
invested
at
three
per
cent
in
the
funds
bought
at
sixty
and
now
worth
francs
also
two
millions
in
gold
coin
and
a
hundred
thousand
francs
in
silver
besides
all
the
interest
which
was
still
to
be
collected
the
sum
total
of
her
property
reached
seventeen
millions
where
is
my
cousin
was
her
one
thought
the
day
on
which
maitre
cruchot
handed
in
to
his
client
a
clear
and
exact
schedule
of
the
whole
inheritance
eugenie
remained
alone
with
nanon
sitting
beside
the
fireplace
in
the
vacant
hall
where
all
was
now
a
memory
from
the
chair
on
castors
which
her
mother
had
sat
in
to
the
glass
from
which
her
cousin
drank
nanon
we
are
alone
yes
mademoiselle
and
if
i
knew
where
he
was
the
darling
i
d
go
on
foot
to
find
the
ocean
is
between
us
she
said
while
the
poor
heiress
wept
in
company
of
an
old
servant
in
that
cold
dark
house
which
was
to
her
the
universe
the
whole
province
rang
from
nantes
to
orleans
with
the
seventeen
millions
of
mademoiselle
grandet
among
her
first
acts
she
had
settled
an
annuity
of
twelve
hundred
francs
on
nanon
who
already
possessed
of
six
hundred
more
became
a
rich
and
enviable
match
in
less
than
a
month
that
good
soul
passed
from
single
to
wedded
life
under
the
protection
of
antoine
cornoiller
who
was
appointed
keeper
of
all
mademoiselle
grandet
s
estates
madame
cornoiller
possessed
one
striking
advantage
over
her
contemporaries
although
she
was
years
of
age
she
did
not
look
more
than
forty
her
strong
features
had
resisted
the
ravages
of
time
thanks
to
the
healthy
customs
of
her
life
she
laughed
at
old
age
from
the
of
a
rosy
skin
and
an
iron
constitution
perhaps
she
never
looked
as
well
in
her
life
as
she
did
on
her
she
had
all
the
benefits
of
her
ugliness
and
was
big
and
fat
and
strong
with
a
look
of
happiness
on
her
indestructible
features
which
made
a
good
many
people
envy
cornoiller
fast
colors
said
the
draper
quite
likely
to
have
children
said
the
salt
merchant
she
s
pickled
in
brine
saving
your
she
is
rich
and
that
fellow
cornoiller
has
done
a
good
thing
for
himself
said
a
third
man
when
she
came
forth
from
the
old
house
on
her
way
to
the
parish
church
nanon
who
was
loved
by
all
the
neighborhood
received
many
compliments
as
she
walked
down
the
tortuous
street
eugenie
had
given
her
three
dozen
silver
forks
and
spoons
as
a
wedding
present
cornoiller
amazed
at
such
magnificence
spoke
of
his
mistress
with
tears
in
his
eyes
he
would
willingly
have
been
hacked
in
pieces
in
her
behalf
madame
cornoiller
appointed
housekeeper
to
mademoiselle
grandet
got
as
much
happiness
out
of
her
new
position
as
she
did
from
the
possession
of
a
husband
she
took
charge
of
the
weekly
accounts
she
locked
up
the
provisions
and
gave
them
out
daily
after
the
manner
of
her
defunct
master
she
ruled
over
two
servants
a
cook
and
a
maid
whose
business
it
was
to
mend
the
and
make
mademoiselle
s
dresses
cornoiller
combined
the
functions
of
keeper
and
bailiff
it
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
the
selected
by
nanon
were
perfect
mademoiselle
grandet
thus
had
four
servants
whose
devotion
was
unbounded
the
farmers
perceived
no
change
after
monsieur
grandet
s
death
the
usages
and
customs
he
had
sternly
established
were
scrupulously
carried
out
by
monsieur
and
madame
cornoiller
at
thirty
years
of
age
eugenie
knew
none
of
the
joys
of
life
her
pale
sad
childhood
had
glided
on
beside
a
mother
whose
heart
always
misunderstood
and
wounded
had
known
only
suffering
leaving
this
life
joyfully
the
mother
pitied
the
daughter
because
she
still
must
live
and
she
left
in
her
child
s
soul
some
fugitive
remorse
and
many
lasting
regrets
eugenie
s
first
and
only
love
was
a
wellspring
of
sadness
within
her
meeting
her
lover
for
a
few
brief
days
she
had
given
him
her
heart
between
two
kisses
furtively
exchanged
then
he
had
left
her
and
a
whole
world
lay
between
them
this
love
cursed
by
her
father
had
cost
the
life
of
her
mother
and
brought
her
only
sorrow
mingled
with
a
few
frail
hopes
thus
her
upward
spring
towards
happiness
had
wasted
her
strength
and
given
her
nothing
in
exchange
for
it
in
the
life
of
the
soul
as
in
the
physical
life
there
is
an
inspiration
and
a
respiration
the
soul
needs
to
absorb
the
sentiments
of
another
soul
and
assimilate
them
that
it
may
render
them
back
enriched
were
it
not
for
this
glorious
human
phenomenon
there
would
be
no
life
for
the
heart
air
would
be
wanting
it
would
suffer
and
then
perish
eugenie
had
begun
to
suffer
for
her
wealth
was
neither
a
power
nor
a
consolation
she
could
not
live
except
through
love
through
religion
through
faith
in
the
future
love
explained
to
her
the
mysteries
of
eternity
her
heart
and
the
gospel
taught
her
to
know
two
worlds
she
bathed
night
and
day
in
the
depths
of
two
infinite
thoughts
which
for
her
may
have
had
but
one
meaning
she
drew
back
within
herself
loving
and
believing
herself
beloved
for
seven
years
her
passion
had
invaded
everything
her
treasuries
were
not
the
millions
whose
revenues
were
rolling
up
they
were
charles
s
the
portraits
hanging
above
her
bed
the
jewels
recovered
from
her
father
and
proudly
spread
upon
a
bed
of
wool
in
a
drawer
of
the
oaken
cabinet
the
thimble
of
her
aunt
used
for
a
while
by
her
mother
which
she
wore
religiously
as
she
worked
at
a
piece
of
embroidery
a
penelope
s
web
begun
for
the
sole
purpose
of
putting
upon
her
finger
that
gold
so
rich
in
memories
it
seemed
unlikely
that
mademoiselle
grandet
would
marry
during
the
period
of
her
mourning
her
genuine
piety
was
well
known
consequently
the
cruchots
whose
policy
was
sagely
guided
by
the
old
abbe
contented
themselves
for
the
time
being
with
surrounding
the
great
heiress
and
paying
her
the
most
affectionate
attentions
every
evening
the
hall
was
filled
with
a
party
of
devoted
cruchotines
who
sang
the
praises
of
its
mistress
in
every
key
she
had
her
doctor
in
ordinary
her
grand
almoner
her
chamberlain
her
first
lady
of
honor
her
prime
minister
above
all
her
chancellor
a
chancellor
who
would
fain
have
said
much
to
her
if
the
heiress
had
wished
for
a
one
would
instantly
have
been
found
she
was
a
queen
obsequiously
flattered
flattery
never
emanates
from
noble
souls
it
is
the
gift
of
little
minds
who
thus
still
further
belittle
themselves
to
worm
their
way
into
the
vital
being
of
the
persons
around
whom
they
crawl
flattery
means
so
the
people
who
night
after
night
assembled
in
mademoiselle
grandet
s
house
they
called
her
mademoiselle
de
froidfond
outdid
each
other
in
expressions
of
admiration
this
concert
of
praise
never
before
bestowed
upon
eugenie
made
her
blush
under
its
novelty
but
insensibly
her
ear
became
habituated
to
the
sound
and
however
coarse
the
compliments
might
be
she
soon
was
so
accustomed
to
hear
her
beauty
lauded
that
if
any
had
seemed
to
think
her
plain
she
would
have
felt
the
reproach
far
more
than
she
might
have
done
eight
years
earlier
she
ended
at
last
by
loving
the
incense
which
she
secretly
laid
at
the
feet
of
her
idol
by
degrees
she
grew
accustomed
to
be
treated
as
a
sovereign
and
to
see
her
court
pressing
around
her
every
evening
monsieur
de
bonfons
was
the
hero
of
the
little
circle
where
his
wit
his
person
his
education
his
amiability
were
perpetually
praised
one
or
another
would
remark
that
in
seven
years
he
had
largely
increased
his
fortune
that
bonfons
brought
in
at
least
ten
thousand
francs
a
year
and
was
surrounded
like
the
other
possessions
of
the
cruchots
by
the
vast
domains
of
the
heiress
do
you
know
mademoiselle
said
an
habitual
visitor
that
the
cruchots
have
an
income
of
forty
thousand
francs
among
them
and
then
their
savings
exclaimed
an
elderly
female
cruchotine
mademoiselle
de
gribeaucourt
a
gentleman
from
paris
has
lately
offered
monsieur
cruchot
two
hundred
thousand
francs
for
his
practice
said
another
he
will
sell
it
if
he
is
appointed
de
he
wants
to
succeed
monsieur
de
bonfons
as
president
of
the
civil
courts
and
is
taking
measures
replied
madame
d
orsonval
monsieur
le
president
will
certainly
be
made
yes
he
is
a
very
distinguished
man
said
another
don
t
you
think
so
mademoiselle
monsieur
de
bonfons
endeavored
to
put
himself
in
keeping
with
the
role
he
sought
to
play
in
spite
of
his
forty
years
in
spite
of
his
dusky
and
crabbed
features
withered
like
most
judicial
faces
he
dressed
in
youthful
fashions
toyed
with
a
bamboo
cane
never
took
snuff
in
mademoiselle
de
froidfond
s
house
and
came
in
a
white
cravat
and
a
shirt
whose
pleated
frill
gave
him
a
family
resemblance
to
the
race
of
turkeys
he
addressed
the
beautiful
heiress
familiarly
and
spoke
of
her
as
our
dear
in
short
except
for
the
number
of
visitors
the
change
from
loto
to
whist
and
the
disappearance
of
monsieur
and
madame
grandet
the
scene
was
about
the
same
as
the
one
with
which
this
history
opened
the
pack
were
still
pursuing
eugenie
and
her
millions
but
the
hounds
more
in
number
lay
better
on
the
scent
and
beset
the
prey
more
unitedly
if
charles
could
have
dropped
from
the
indian
isles
he
would
have
found
the
same
people
and
the
same
interests
madame
des
grassins
to
whom
eugenie
was
full
of
kindness
and
courtesy
still
persisted
in
tormenting
the
cruchots
eugenie
as
in
former
days
was
the
central
figure
of
the
picture
and
charles
as
heretofore
would
still
have
been
the
sovereign
of
all
yet
there
had
been
some
progress
the
flowers
which
the
president
formerly
presented
to
eugenie
on
her
birthdays
and
had
now
become
a
daily
institution
every
evening
he
brought
the
rich
heiress
a
huge
and
magnificent
bouquet
which
madame
cornoiller
placed
conspicuously
in
a
vase
and
secretly
threw
into
a
corner
of
the
when
the
visitors
had
departed
early
in
the
spring
madame
des
grassins
attempted
to
trouble
the
peace
of
the
cruchotines
by
talking
to
eugenie
of
the
marquis
de
froidfond
whose
ancient
and
ruined
family
might
be
restored
if
the
heiress
would
give
him
back
his
estates
through
marriage
madame
des
grassins
rang
the
changes
on
the
peerage
and
the
title
of
marquise
until
mistaking
eugenie
s
disdainful
smile
for
acquiescence
she
went
about
proclaiming
that
the
marriage
with
monsieur
cruchot
was
not
nearly
as
certain
as
people
thought
though
monsieur
de
froidfond
is
fifty
she
said
he
does
not
look
older
than
monsieur
cruchot
he
is
a
widower
and
he
has
children
that
s
true
but
then
he
is
a
marquis
he
will
be
peer
of
france
and
in
times
like
these
where
you
will
find
a
better
match
i
know
it
for
a
fact
that
pere
grandet
when
he
put
all
his
money
into
froidfond
intended
to
graft
himself
upon
that
stock
he
often
told
me
so
he
was
a
deep
one
that
old
man
ah
nanon
said
eugenie
one
night
as
she
was
going
to
bed
how
is
it
that
in
seven
years
he
has
never
once
written
to
me
xiii
while
these
events
were
happening
in
saumur
charles
was
making
his
fortune
in
the
indies
his
commercial
outfit
had
sold
well
he
began
by
realizing
a
sum
of
six
thousand
dollars
crossing
the
line
had
brushed
a
good
many
cobwebs
out
of
his
brain
he
perceived
that
the
best
means
of
attaining
fortune
in
tropical
regions
as
well
as
in
europe
was
to
buy
and
sell
men
he
went
to
the
coast
of
africa
and
bought
negroes
combining
his
traffic
in
human
flesh
with
that
of
other
merchandise
equally
advantageous
to
his
interests
he
carried
into
this
business
an
activity
which
left
him
not
a
moment
of
leisure
he
was
governed
by
the
desire
of
reappearing
in
paris
with
all
the
prestige
of
a
large
fortune
and
by
the
hope
of
regaining
a
position
even
more
brilliant
than
the
one
from
which
he
had
fallen
by
dint
of
jostling
with
men
travelling
through
many
lands
and
studying
a
variety
of
conflicting
customs
his
ideas
had
been
modified
and
had
become
sceptical
he
ceased
to
have
fixed
principles
of
right
and
wrong
for
he
saw
what
was
called
a
crime
in
one
country
lauded
as
a
virtue
in
another
in
the
perpetual
struggle
of
selfish
interests
his
heart
grew
cold
then
contracted
and
then
dried
up
the
blood
of
the
grandets
did
not
fail
of
its
destiny
charles
became
hard
and
eager
for
prey
he
sold
chinamen
negroes
birds
nests
children
artists
he
practised
usury
on
a
large
scale
the
habit
of
defrauding
soon
made
him
less
scrupulous
about
the
rights
of
his
fellow
men
he
went
to
the
island
of
thomas
and
bought
for
a
mere
song
merchandise
that
had
been
captured
by
pirates
and
took
it
to
ports
where
he
could
sell
it
at
a
good
price
if
the
pure
and
noble
face
of
eugenie
went
with
him
on
his
first
voyage
like
that
image
of
the
virgin
which
spanish
mariners
fastened
to
their
masts
if
he
attributed
his
first
success
to
the
magic
influence
of
the
prayers
and
intercessions
of
his
gentle
love
later
on
women
of
other
kinds
blacks
mulattoes
whites
and
indian
orgies
and
adventures
in
many
lands
completely
effaced
all
recollection
of
his
cousin
of
saumur
of
the
house
the
bench
the
kiss
snatched
in
the
dark
passage
he
remembered
only
the
little
garden
shut
in
with
crumbling
walls
for
it
was
there
he
learned
the
fate
that
had
overtaken
him
but
he
rejected
all
connection
with
his
family
his
uncle
was
an
old
dog
who
had
filched
his
jewels
eugenie
had
no
place
in
his
heart
nor
in
his
thoughts
though
she
did
have
a
place
in
his
accounts
as
a
creditor
for
the
sum
of
six
thousand
francs
such
conduct
and
such
ideas
explain
charles
grandet
s
silence
in
the
indies
at
thomas
on
the
coast
of
africa
at
lisbon
and
in
the
united
states
the
adventurer
had
taken
the
pseudonym
of
shepherd
that
he
might
not
compromise
his
own
name
charles
shepherd
could
safely
be
indefatigable
bold
grasping
and
greedy
of
gain
like
a
man
who
resolves
to
snatch
his
fortune
cumque
and
makes
haste
to
have
done
with
villany
that
he
may
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
as
an
honest
man
with
such
methods
prosperity
was
rapid
and
brilliant
and
in
charles
grandet
returned
to
bordeaux
on
the
marie
caroline
a
fine
brig
belonging
to
a
royalist
house
of
business
he
brought
with
him
nineteen
hundred
thousand
francs
worth
of
from
which
he
expected
to
derive
seven
or
eight
per
cent
more
at
the
paris
mint
on
the
brig
he
met
a
to
his
majesty
charles
monsieur
d
aubrion
a
worthy
old
man
who
had
committed
the
folly
of
marrying
a
woman
of
fashion
with
a
fortune
derived
from
the
west
india
islands
to
meet
the
costs
of
madame
d
aubrion
s
extravagance
he
had
gone
out
to
the
indies
to
sell
the
property
and
was
now
returning
with
his
family
to
france
monsieur
and
madame
d
aubrion
of
the
house
of
d
aubrion
de
buch
a
family
of
southern
france
whose
last
or
chief
died
before
were
now
reduced
to
an
income
of
about
twenty
thousand
francs
and
they
possessed
an
ugly
daughter
whom
the
mother
was
resolved
to
marry
without
a
the
family
fortune
being
scarcely
sufficient
for
the
demands
of
her
own
life
in
paris
this
was
an
enterprise
whose
success
might
have
seemed
problematical
to
most
men
of
the
world
in
spite
of
the
cleverness
with
which
such
men
credit
a
fashionable
woman
in
fact
madame
d
aubrion
herself
when
she
looked
at
her
daughter
almost
despaired
of
getting
rid
of
her
to
any
one
even
to
a
man
craving
connection
with
nobility
mademoiselle
d
aubrion
was
a
long
spare
spindling
demoiselle
like
her
namesake
the
insect
her
mouth
was
disdainful
over
it
hung
a
nose
that
was
too
long
thick
at
the
end
sallow
in
its
normal
condition
but
very
red
after
a
meal
a
sort
of
vegetable
phenomenon
which
is
particularly
disagreeable
when
it
appears
in
the
middle
of
a
pale
dull
and
uninteresting
face
in
one
sense
she
was
all
that
a
worldly
mother
years
of
age
and
still
a
beauty
with
claims
to
admiration
could
have
wished
however
to
counterbalance
her
personal
defects
the
marquise
gave
her
daughter
a
distinguished
air
subjected
her
to
hygienic
treatment
which
provisionally
kept
her
nose
at
a
reasonable
taught
her
the
art
of
dressing
well
endowed
her
with
charming
manners
showed
her
the
trick
of
melancholy
glances
which
interest
a
man
and
make
him
believe
that
he
has
found
a
angel
taught
her
the
manoeuvre
of
the
foot
letting
it
peep
beneath
the
petticoat
to
show
its
tiny
size
at
the
moment
when
the
nose
became
aggressively
red
in
short
madame
d
aubrion
had
cleverly
made
the
very
best
of
her
offspring
by
means
of
full
sleeves
deceptive
pads
puffed
dresses
amply
trimmed
and
corsets
she
had
obtained
such
curious
feminine
developments
that
she
ought
for
the
instruction
of
mothers
to
have
exhibited
them
in
a
museum
charles
became
very
intimate
with
madame
d
aubrion
precisely
because
she
was
desirous
of
becoming
intimate
with
him
persons
who
were
on
board
the
brig
declared
that
the
handsome
madame
d
aubrion
neglected
no
means
of
capturing
so
rich
a
on
landing
at
bordeaux
in
june
monsieur
madame
mademoiselle
d
aubrion
and
charles
lodged
at
the
same
hotel
and
started
together
for
paris
the
hotel
d
aubrion
was
hampered
with
mortgages
charles
was
destined
to
free
it
the
mother
told
him
how
delighted
she
would
be
to
give
up
the
to
a
not
sharing
monsieur
d
aubrion
s
prejudices
on
the
score
of
nobility
she
promised
charles
grandet
to
obtain
a
royal
ordinance
from
charles
which
would
authorize
him
grandet
to
take
the
name
and
arms
of
d
aubrion
and
to
succeed
by
purchasing
the
entailed
estate
for
thousand
francs
a
year
to
the
titles
of
captal
de
buch
and
marquis
d
aubrion
by
thus
uniting
their
fortunes
living
on
good
terms
and
profiting
by
sinecures
the
two
families
might
occupy
the
hotel
d
aubrion
with
an
income
of
over
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
when
a
man
has
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
a
name
a
family
and
a
position
at
court
for
i
will
get
you
appointed
as
he
can
do
what
he
likes
she
said
to
charles
you
can
then
become
anything
you
choose
master
of
the
rolls
in
the
council
of
state
prefect
secretary
to
an
embassy
the
ambassador
himself
if
you
like
charles
is
fond
of
d
aubrion
they
have
known
each
other
from
intoxicated
with
ambition
charles
toyed
with
the
hopes
thus
cleverly
presented
to
him
in
the
guise
of
confidences
poured
from
heart
to
heart
believing
his
father
s
affairs
to
have
been
settled
by
his
uncle
he
imagined
himself
suddenly
anchored
in
the
faubourg
that
social
object
of
all
desire
where
under
shelter
of
mademoiselle
mathilde
s
purple
nose
he
was
to
reappear
as
the
comte
d
aubrion
very
much
as
the
dreux
reappeared
in
breze
dazzled
by
the
prosperity
of
the
restoration
which
was
tottering
when
he
left
france
fascinated
by
the
splendor
of
aristocratic
ideas
his
intoxication
which
began
on
the
brig
increased
after
he
reached
paris
and
he
finally
determined
to
take
the
course
and
reach
the
high
position
which
the
selfish
hopes
of
his
pointed
out
to
him
his
cousin
counted
for
no
more
than
a
speck
in
this
brilliant
perspective
but
he
went
to
see
annette
true
woman
of
the
world
annette
advised
her
old
friend
to
make
the
marriage
and
promised
him
her
support
in
all
his
ambitious
projects
in
her
heart
she
was
enchanted
to
fasten
an
ugly
and
uninteresting
girl
on
charles
whose
life
in
the
west
indies
had
rendered
him
very
attractive
his
complexion
had
bronzed
his
manners
had
grown
decided
and
bold
like
those
of
a
man
accustomed
to
make
sharp
decisions
to
rule
and
to
succeed
charles
breathed
more
at
his
ease
in
paris
conscious
that
he
now
had
a
part
to
play
des
grassins
hearing
of
his
return
of
his
approaching
marriage
and
his
large
fortune
came
to
see
him
and
inquired
about
the
three
hundred
thousand
francs
still
required
to
settle
his
father
s
debts
he
found
grandet
in
conference
with
a
goldsmith
from
whom
he
had
ordered
jewels
for
mademoiselle
d
aubrion
s
and
who
was
then
submitting
the
designs
charles
had
brought
back
magnificent
diamonds
and
the
value
of
their
setting
together
with
the
plate
and
jewelry
of
the
new
establishment
amounted
to
more
than
two
hundred
thousand
francs
he
received
des
grassins
whom
he
did
not
recognize
with
the
impertinence
of
a
young
man
of
fashion
conscious
of
having
killed
four
men
in
as
many
duels
in
the
indies
monsieur
des
grassins
had
already
called
several
times
charles
listened
to
him
coldly
and
then
replied
without
fully
understanding
what
had
been
said
to
him
my
father
s
affairs
are
not
mine
i
am
much
obliged
monsieur
for
the
trouble
you
have
been
good
enough
to
take
by
which
however
i
really
can
not
profit
i
have
not
earned
two
millions
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
to
fling
them
at
the
head
of
my
father
s
but
suppose
that
your
father
s
estate
were
within
a
few
days
to
be
declared
bankrupt
monsieur
in
a
few
days
i
shall
be
called
the
comte
d
aubrion
you
will
understand
therefore
that
what
you
threaten
is
of
no
consequence
to
me
besides
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
when
a
man
has
an
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
his
father
has
so
saying
he
politely
edged
monsieur
des
grassins
to
the
door
at
the
beginning
of
august
in
the
same
year
eugenie
was
sitting
on
the
little
wooden
bench
where
her
cousin
had
sworn
to
love
her
eternally
and
where
she
usually
breakfasted
if
the
weather
were
fine
the
poor
girl
was
happy
for
the
moment
in
the
fresh
and
joyous
summer
air
letting
her
memory
recall
the
great
and
the
little
events
of
her
love
and
the
catastrophes
which
had
followed
it
the
sun
had
just
reached
the
angle
of
the
ruined
wall
so
full
of
chinks
which
no
one
through
a
caprice
of
the
mistress
was
allowed
to
touch
though
cornoiller
often
remarked
to
his
wife
that
it
would
fall
and
crush
somebody
one
of
these
at
this
moment
the
postman
knocked
and
gave
a
letter
to
madame
cornoiller
who
ran
into
the
garden
crying
out
mademoiselle
a
letter
she
gave
it
to
her
mistress
adding
is
it
the
one
you
expected
the
words
rang
as
loudly
in
the
heart
of
eugenie
as
they
echoed
in
sound
from
wall
to
wall
of
the
court
and
garden
paris
from
him
he
has
returned
eugenie
turned
pale
and
held
the
letter
for
a
moment
she
trembled
so
violently
that
she
could
not
break
the
seal
la
grande
nanon
stood
before
her
both
hands
on
her
hips
her
joy
puffing
as
it
were
like
smoke
through
the
cracks
of
her
brown
face
read
it
mademoiselle
ah
nanon
why
did
he
return
to
paris
he
went
from
read
it
and
you
ll
find
eugenie
opened
the
letter
with
trembling
fingers
a
cheque
on
the
house
of
madame
des
grassins
and
coret
of
saumur
fluttered
down
nanon
picked
it
up
my
dear
cousin
no
longer
eugenie
she
thought
and
her
heart
quailed
you
he
once
said
she
folded
her
arms
and
dared
not
read
another
word
great
tears
gathered
in
her
eyes
is
he
dead
asked
nanon
if
he
were
he
could
not
write
said
eugenie
she
then
read
the
whole
letter
which
was
as
follows
my
dear
cousin
you
will
i
am
sure
hear
with
pleasure
of
the
success
of
my
enterprise
you
brought
me
luck
i
have
come
back
rich
and
i
have
followed
the
advice
of
my
uncle
whose
death
together
with
that
of
my
aunt
i
have
just
learned
from
monsieur
des
grassins
the
death
of
parents
is
in
the
course
of
nature
and
we
must
succeed
them
i
trust
you
are
by
this
time
consoled
nothing
can
resist
time
as
i
am
well
aware
yes
my
dear
cousin
the
day
of
illusions
is
unfortunately
gone
for
me
how
could
it
be
otherwise
travelling
through
many
lands
i
have
reflected
upon
life
i
was
a
child
when
i
went
away
i
have
come
back
a
man
i
think
of
many
i
did
not
dream
of
then
you
are
free
my
dear
cousin
and
i
am
free
still
nothing
apparently
hinders
the
realization
of
our
early
hopes
but
my
nature
is
too
loyal
to
hide
from
you
the
situation
in
which
i
find
myself
i
have
not
forgotten
our
relations
i
have
always
remembered
throughout
my
long
wanderings
the
little
wooden
seat
eugenie
rose
as
if
she
were
sitting
on
live
coals
and
went
away
and
sat
down
on
the
stone
steps
of
the
court
the
little
wooden
seat
where
we
vowed
to
love
each
other
forever
the
passage
the
gray
hall
my
attic
chamber
and
the
night
when
by
your
delicate
kindness
you
made
my
future
easier
to
me
yes
these
recollections
sustained
my
courage
i
said
in
my
heart
that
you
were
thinking
of
me
at
the
hour
we
had
agreed
upon
have
you
always
looked
at
the
clouds
at
nine
o
clock
yes
i
am
sure
of
it
i
can
not
betray
so
true
a
friendship
no
i
must
not
deceive
you
an
alliance
has
been
proposed
to
me
which
satisfies
all
my
ideas
of
matrimony
love
in
marriage
is
a
delusion
my
present
experience
warns
me
that
in
marrying
we
are
bound
to
obey
all
social
laws
and
meet
the
conventional
demands
of
the
world
now
between
you
and
me
there
are
differences
which
might
affect
your
future
my
dear
cousin
even
more
than
they
would
mine
i
will
not
here
speak
of
your
customs
and
inclinations
your
education
nor
yet
of
your
habits
none
of
which
are
in
keeping
with
parisian
life
or
with
the
future
which
i
have
marked
out
for
myself
my
intention
is
to
keep
my
household
on
a
stately
footing
to
receive
much
company
in
short
to
live
in
the
world
and
i
think
i
remember
that
you
love
a
quiet
and
tranquil
life
i
will
be
frank
and
make
you
the
judge
of
my
situation
you
have
the
right
to
understand
it
and
to
judge
it
i
possess
at
the
present
moment
an
income
of
eighty
thousand
francs
this
fortune
enables
me
to
marry
into
the
family
of
aubrion
whose
heiress
a
young
girl
nineteen
years
of
age
brings
me
a
title
a
place
of
to
his
majesty
and
a
very
brilliant
position
i
will
admit
to
you
my
dear
cousin
that
i
do
not
love
mademoiselle
d
aubrion
but
in
marrying
her
i
secure
to
my
children
a
social
rank
whose
advantages
will
one
day
be
incalculable
monarchical
principles
are
daily
coming
more
and
more
into
favor
thus
in
course
of
time
my
son
when
he
becomes
marquis
d
aubrion
having
as
he
then
will
have
an
entailed
estate
with
a
rental
of
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
can
obtain
any
position
in
the
state
which
he
may
think
proper
to
select
we
owe
ourselves
to
our
children
you
see
my
cousin
with
what
good
faith
i
lay
the
state
of
my
heart
my
hopes
and
my
fortune
before
you
possibly
after
seven
years
separation
you
have
yourself
forgotten
our
youthful
loves
but
i
have
never
forgotten
either
your
kindness
or
my
own
words
i
remember
all
even
words
that
were
lightly
uttered
words
by
which
a
man
less
conscientious
than
i
with
a
heart
less
youthful
and
less
upright
would
scarcely
feel
himself
bound
in
telling
you
that
the
marriage
i
propose
to
make
is
solely
one
of
convenience
that
i
still
remember
our
childish
love
am
i
not
putting
myself
entirely
in
your
hands
and
making
you
the
mistress
of
my
fate
am
i
not
telling
you
that
if
i
must
renounce
my
social
ambitions
i
shall
willingly
content
myself
with
the
pure
and
simple
happiness
of
which
you
have
shown
me
so
sweet
an
image
tan
ta
ta
tan
ta
ti
sang
charles
grandet
to
the
air
of
piu
as
he
signed
himself
your
devoted
cousin
charles
thunder
that
s
doing
it
handsomely
he
said
as
he
looked
about
him
for
the
cheque
having
found
it
he
added
the
words
i
enclose
a
cheque
on
the
des
grassins
bank
for
eight
thousand
francs
to
your
order
payable
in
gold
which
includes
the
capital
and
interest
of
the
sum
you
were
kind
enough
to
lend
me
i
am
expecting
a
case
from
bordeaux
which
contains
a
few
things
which
you
must
allow
me
to
offer
you
as
a
mark
of
my
unceasing
gratitude
you
can
send
my
by
the
diligence
to
the
hotel
d
aubrion
rue
by
the
diligence
said
eugenie
a
thing
for
which
i
would
have
laid
down
my
life
terrible
and
utter
disaster
the
ship
went
down
leaving
not
a
spar
not
a
plank
on
a
vast
ocean
of
hope
some
women
when
they
see
themselves
abandoned
will
try
to
tear
their
lover
from
the
arms
of
a
rival
they
will
kill
her
and
rush
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
the
scaffold
to
their
tomb
that
no
doubt
is
fine
the
motive
of
the
crime
is
a
great
passion
which
awes
even
human
justice
other
women
bow
their
heads
and
suffer
in
silence
they
go
their
way
dying
resigned
weeping
forgiving
praying
and
recollecting
till
they
draw
their
last
breath
this
is
love
true
love
the
love
of
angels
the
proud
love
which
lives
upon
its
anguish
and
dies
of
it
such
was
eugenie
s
love
after
she
had
read
that
dreadful
letter
she
raised
her
eyes
to
heaven
thinking
of
the
last
words
uttered
by
her
dying
mother
who
with
the
prescience
of
death
had
looked
into
the
future
with
clear
and
penetrating
eyes
eugenie
remembering
that
prophetic
death
that
prophetic
life
measured
with
one
glance
her
own
destiny
nothing
was
left
for
her
she
could
only
unfold
her
wings
stretch
upward
to
the
skies
and
live
in
prayer
until
the
day
of
her
deliverance
my
mother
was
right
she
said
weeping
suffer
and
die
xiv
eugenie
came
slowly
back
from
the
garden
to
the
house
and
avoided
passing
as
was
her
custom
through
the
corridor
but
the
memory
of
her
cousin
was
in
the
gray
old
hall
and
on
the
where
stood
a
certain
saucer
and
the
old
sevres
which
she
used
every
morning
at
her
breakfast
this
day
was
destined
to
be
solemn
throughout
and
full
of
events
nanon
announced
the
cure
of
the
parish
church
he
was
related
to
the
cruchots
and
therefore
in
the
interests
of
monsieur
de
bonfons
for
some
time
past
the
old
abbe
had
urged
him
to
speak
to
mademoiselle
grandet
from
a
purely
religious
point
of
view
about
the
duty
of
marriage
for
a
woman
in
her
position
when
she
saw
her
pastor
eugenie
supposed
he
had
come
for
the
thousand
francs
which
she
gave
monthly
to
the
poor
and
she
told
nanon
to
go
and
fetch
them
but
the
cure
only
smiled
mademoiselle
he
said
i
have
come
to
speak
to
you
about
a
poor
girl
in
whom
the
whole
town
of
saumur
takes
an
interest
who
through
lack
of
charity
to
herself
neglects
her
christian
monsieur
le
cure
you
have
come
to
me
at
a
moment
when
i
can
not
think
of
my
neighbor
i
am
filled
with
thoughts
of
myself
i
am
very
unhappy
my
only
refuge
is
in
the
church
her
bosom
is
large
enough
to
hold
all
human
woe
her
love
so
full
that
we
may
draw
from
its
depths
and
never
drain
it
mademoiselle
in
speaking
of
this
young
girl
we
shall
speak
of
you
listen
if
you
wish
to
insure
your
salvation
you
have
only
two
paths
to
take
either
leave
the
world
or
obey
its
laws
obey
either
your
earthly
destiny
or
your
heavenly
ah
your
voice
speaks
to
me
when
i
need
to
hear
a
voice
yes
god
has
sent
you
to
me
i
will
bid
farewell
to
the
world
and
live
for
god
alone
in
silence
and
my
daughter
you
must
think
long
before
you
take
so
violent
a
step
marriage
is
life
the
veil
is
yes
death
a
quick
death
she
said
with
dreadful
eagerness
death
but
you
have
great
obligations
to
fulfil
to
society
mademoiselle
are
you
not
the
mother
of
the
poor
to
whom
you
give
clothes
and
wood
in
winter
and
work
in
summer
your
great
fortune
is
a
loan
which
you
must
return
and
you
have
sacredly
accepted
it
as
such
to
bury
yourself
in
a
convent
would
be
selfishness
to
remain
an
old
maid
is
to
fail
in
duty
in
the
first
place
can
you
manage
your
vast
property
alone
may
you
not
lose
it
you
will
have
you
will
find
yourself
surrounded
by
inextricable
difficulties
believe
your
pastor
a
husband
is
useful
you
are
bound
to
preserve
what
god
has
bestowed
upon
you
i
speak
to
you
as
a
precious
lamb
of
my
flock
you
love
god
too
truly
not
to
find
your
salvation
in
the
midst
of
his
world
of
which
you
are
noble
ornament
and
to
which
you
owe
your
at
this
moment
madame
des
grassins
was
announced
she
came
incited
by
vengeance
and
the
sense
of
a
great
despair
mademoiselle
she
said
ah
here
is
monsieur
le
cure
i
am
silent
i
came
to
speak
to
you
on
business
but
i
see
that
you
are
conferring
with
madame
said
the
cure
i
leave
the
field
to
oh
monsieur
le
cure
said
eugenie
come
back
later
your
support
is
very
necessary
to
me
just
ah
yes
indeed
my
poor
child
said
madame
des
grassins
what
do
you
mean
asked
eugenie
and
the
cure
together
don
t
i
know
about
your
cousin
s
return
and
his
marriage
with
mademoiselle
d
aubrion
a
woman
doesn
t
carry
her
wits
in
her
eugenie
blushed
and
remained
silent
for
a
moment
from
this
day
forth
she
assumed
the
impassible
countenance
for
which
her
father
had
been
so
remarkable
well
madame
she
presently
said
ironically
no
doubt
i
carry
my
wits
in
my
pocket
for
i
do
not
understand
you
speak
say
what
you
mean
before
monsieur
le
cure
you
know
he
is
my
well
then
mademoiselle
here
is
what
des
grassins
writes
me
read
eugenie
read
the
following
letter
my
dear
wife
charles
grandet
has
returned
from
the
indies
and
has
been
in
paris
about
a
month
a
month
thought
eugenie
her
hand
falling
to
her
side
after
a
pause
she
resumed
the
letter
i
had
to
dance
attendance
before
i
was
allowed
to
see
the
future
vicomte
d
aubrion
though
all
paris
is
talking
of
his
marriage
and
the
banns
are
published
he
wrote
to
me
after
that
thought
eugenie
she
did
not
conclude
the
thought
she
did
not
cry
out
as
a
parisian
woman
would
have
done
the
villain
but
though
she
said
it
not
contempt
was
none
the
less
present
in
her
mind
the
marriage
however
will
not
come
off
the
marquis
d
aubrion
will
never
give
his
daughter
to
the
son
of
a
bankrupt
i
went
to
tell
grandet
of
the
steps
his
uncle
and
i
took
in
his
father
s
business
and
the
clever
manoeuvres
by
which
we
had
managed
to
keep
the
creditor
s
quiet
until
the
present
time
the
insolent
fellow
had
the
face
to
say
to
me
to
me
who
for
five
years
have
devoted
myself
night
and
day
to
his
interests
and
his
honor
that
father
s
affairs
were
not
a
solicitor
would
have
had
the
right
to
demand
fees
amounting
to
thirty
or
forty
thousand
francs
one
per
cent
on
the
total
of
the
debts
but
patience
there
are
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
legitimately
owing
to
the
creditors
and
i
shall
at
once
declare
his
father
a
bankrupt
i
went
into
this
business
on
the
word
of
that
old
crocodile
grandet
and
i
have
made
promises
in
the
name
of
his
family
if
monsieur
de
vicomte
d
aubrion
does
not
care
for
his
honor
i
care
for
mine
i
shall
explain
my
position
to
the
creditors
still
i
have
too
much
respect
for
mademoiselle
eugenie
to
whom
under
happier
circumstances
we
once
hoped
to
be
allied
to
act
in
this
matter
before
you
have
spoken
to
her
about
it
there
eugenie
paused
and
coldly
returned
the
letter
without
finishing
it
i
thank
you
she
said
to
madame
des
grassins
ah
you
have
the
voice
and
manner
of
your
deceased
father
madame
des
grassins
replied
madame
you
have
eight
thousand
francs
to
pay
us
said
nanon
producing
charles
s
cheque
that
s
true
have
the
kindness
to
come
with
me
now
madame
monsieur
le
cure
said
eugenie
with
a
noble
composure
inspired
by
the
thought
she
was
about
to
express
would
it
be
a
sin
to
remain
a
virgin
after
marriage
that
is
a
case
of
conscience
whose
solution
is
not
within
my
knowledge
if
you
wish
to
know
what
the
celebrated
sanchez
says
of
it
in
his
treatise
de
matrimonio
i
shall
be
able
to
tell
you
the
cure
went
away
mademoiselle
grandet
went
up
to
her
father
s
secret
room
and
spent
the
day
there
alone
without
coming
down
to
dinner
in
spite
of
nanon
s
entreaties
she
appeared
in
the
evening
at
the
hour
when
the
usual
company
began
to
arrive
never
was
the
old
hall
so
full
as
on
this
occasion
the
news
of
charles
s
return
and
his
foolish
treachery
had
spread
through
the
whole
town
but
however
watchful
the
curiosity
of
the
visitors
might
be
it
was
left
unsatisfied
eugenie
who
expected
scrutiny
allowed
none
of
the
cruel
emotions
that
wrung
her
soul
to
appear
on
the
calm
surface
of
her
face
she
was
able
to
show
a
smiling
front
in
answer
to
all
who
tried
to
testify
their
interest
by
mournful
looks
or
melancholy
speeches
she
hid
her
misery
behind
a
veil
of
courtesy
towards
nine
o
clock
the
games
ended
and
the
players
left
the
tables
paying
their
losses
and
discussing
points
of
the
game
as
they
joined
the
rest
of
the
company
at
the
moment
when
the
whole
party
rose
to
take
leave
an
unexpected
and
striking
event
occurred
which
resounded
through
the
length
and
breadth
of
saumur
from
thence
through
the
arrondissement
and
even
to
the
four
surrounding
prefectures
stay
monsieur
le
president
said
eugenie
to
monsieur
de
bonfons
as
she
saw
him
take
his
cane
there
was
not
a
person
in
that
numerous
assembly
who
was
unmoved
by
these
words
the
president
turned
pale
and
was
forced
to
sit
down
the
president
gets
the
millions
said
mademoiselle
de
gribeaucourt
it
is
plain
enough
the
president
marries
mademoiselle
grandet
cried
madame
d
orsonval
all
the
trumps
in
one
hand
said
the
abbe
a
love
game
said
the
notary
each
and
all
said
his
say
made
his
pun
and
looked
at
the
heiress
mounted
on
her
millions
as
on
a
pedestal
the
drama
begun
nine
years
before
had
reached
its
conclusion
to
tell
the
president
in
face
of
all
saumur
to
stay
was
surely
the
same
thing
as
proclaiming
him
her
husband
in
provincial
towns
social
conventionalities
are
so
rigidly
enforced
than
an
infraction
like
this
constituted
a
solemn
promise
monsieur
le
president
said
eugenie
in
a
voice
of
some
emotion
when
they
were
left
alone
i
know
what
pleases
you
in
me
swear
to
leave
me
free
during
my
whole
life
to
claim
none
of
the
rights
which
marriage
will
give
you
over
me
and
my
hand
is
yours
oh
she
added
seeing
him
about
to
kneel
at
her
feet
i
have
more
to
say
i
must
not
deceive
you
in
my
heart
i
cherish
one
inextinguishable
feeling
friendship
is
the
only
sentiment
which
i
can
give
to
a
husband
i
wish
neither
to
affront
him
nor
to
violate
the
laws
of
my
own
heart
but
you
can
possess
my
hand
and
my
fortune
only
at
the
cost
of
doing
me
an
inestimable
i
am
ready
for
all
things
said
the
president
here
are
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
she
said
drawing
from
her
bosom
a
certificate
of
a
hundred
shares
in
the
bank
of
france
go
to
paris
not
but
instantly
find
monsieur
des
grassins
learn
the
names
of
my
uncle
s
creditors
call
them
together
pay
them
in
full
all
that
was
owing
with
interest
at
five
per
cent
from
the
day
the
debt
was
incurred
to
the
present
time
be
careful
to
obtain
a
full
and
legal
receipt
in
proper
form
before
a
notary
you
are
a
magistrate
and
i
can
trust
this
matter
in
your
hands
you
are
a
man
of
honor
i
will
put
faith
in
your
word
and
meet
the
dangers
of
life
under
shelter
of
your
name
let
us
have
mutual
indulgence
we
have
known
each
other
so
long
that
we
are
almost
related
you
would
not
wish
to
render
me
the
president
fell
at
the
feet
of
the
rich
heiress
his
heart
beating
and
wrung
with
joy
i
will
be
your
slave
he
said
when
you
obtain
the
receipts
monsieur
she
resumed
with
a
cold
glance
you
will
take
them
with
all
the
other
papers
to
my
cousin
grandet
and
you
will
give
him
this
letter
on
your
return
i
will
keep
my
the
president
understood
perfectly
that
he
owed
the
acquiescence
of
mademoiselle
grandet
to
some
bitterness
of
love
and
he
made
haste
to
obey
her
orders
lest
time
should
effect
a
reconciliation
between
the
pair
when
monsieur
de
bonfons
left
her
eugenie
fell
back
in
her
chair
and
burst
into
tears
all
was
over
the
president
took
the
and
reached
paris
the
next
evening
the
morning
after
his
arrival
he
went
to
see
des
grassins
and
together
they
summoned
the
creditors
to
meet
at
the
notary
s
office
where
the
vouchers
had
been
deposited
not
a
single
creditor
failed
to
be
present
creditors
though
they
were
justice
must
be
done
to
them
they
were
all
punctual
monsieur
de
bonfons
in
the
name
of
mademoiselle
grandet
paid
them
the
amount
of
their
claims
with
interest
the
payment
of
interest
was
a
remarkable
event
in
the
parisian
commerce
of
that
day
when
the
receipts
were
all
legally
registered
and
des
grassins
had
received
for
his
services
the
sum
of
fifty
thousand
francs
allowed
to
him
by
eugenie
the
president
made
his
way
to
the
hotel
d
aubrion
and
found
charles
just
entering
his
own
apartment
after
a
serious
encounter
with
his
prospective
the
old
marquis
had
told
him
plainly
that
he
should
not
marry
his
daughter
until
all
the
creditors
of
guillaume
grandet
had
been
paid
in
full
the
president
gave
charles
the
following
letter
my
cousin
monsieur
le
president
de
bonfons
has
undertaken
to
place
in
your
hands
the
aquittance
for
all
claims
upon
my
uncle
also
a
receipt
by
which
i
acknowledge
having
received
from
you
the
sum
total
of
those
claims
i
have
heard
of
a
possible
failure
and
i
think
that
the
son
of
a
bankrupt
may
not
be
able
to
marry
mademoiselle
d
aubrion
yes
my
cousin
you
judged
rightly
of
my
mind
and
of
my
manners
i
have
it
is
true
no
part
in
the
world
i
understand
neither
its
calculations
nor
its
customs
and
i
could
not
give
you
the
pleasures
that
you
seek
in
it
be
happy
according
to
the
social
conventions
to
which
you
have
sacrificed
our
love
to
make
your
happiness
complete
i
can
only
offer
you
your
father
s
honor
adieu
you
will
always
have
a
faithful
friend
in
your
cousin
eugenie
the
president
smiled
at
the
exclamation
which
the
ambitious
young
man
could
not
repress
as
he
received
the
documents
we
shall
announce
our
marriages
at
the
same
time
remarked
monsieur
de
bonfons
ah
you
marry
eugenie
well
i
am
delighted
she
is
a
good
girl
but
added
charles
struck
with
a
luminous
idea
she
must
be
rich
she
had
said
the
president
with
a
mischievous
smile
about
nineteen
millions
four
days
ago
but
she
has
only
seventeen
millions
charles
looked
at
him
thunderstruck
seventeen
mil
seventeen
millions
yes
monsieur
we
shall
muster
mademoiselle
grandet
and
i
an
income
of
seven
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
when
we
my
dear
cousin
said
charles
recovering
a
little
of
his
assurance
we
can
push
each
other
s
agreed
said
the
president
here
is
also
a
little
case
which
i
am
charged
to
give
into
your
own
hands
he
added
placing
on
the
table
the
leather
box
which
contained
the
well
my
dear
friend
said
madame
d
aubrion
entering
the
room
without
noticing
the
president
don
t
pay
any
attention
to
what
poor
monsieur
d
aubrion
has
just
said
to
you
the
duchesse
de
chaulieu
has
turned
his
head
i
repeat
nothing
shall
interfere
with
the
marriage
very
good
madame
the
three
millions
which
my
father
owed
were
paid
in
money
she
asked
yes
in
full
capital
and
interest
and
i
am
about
to
do
honor
to
his
memory
what
folly
exclaimed
his
who
is
this
she
whispered
in
grandet
s
ear
perceiving
the
president
my
man
of
business
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
the
marquise
bowed
superciliously
to
monsieur
de
bonfons
we
are
pushing
each
other
s
fortunes
already
said
the
president
taking
up
his
hat
he
is
laughing
at
me
the
old
cockatoo
i
d
like
to
put
six
inches
of
iron
into
him
muttered
charles
the
president
was
out
of
hearing
three
days
later
monsieur
de
bonfons
on
his
return
to
saumur
announced
his
marriage
with
eugenie
six
months
after
the
marriage
he
was
appointed
councillor
in
the
cour
royale
at
angers
before
leaving
saumur
madame
de
bonfons
had
the
gold
of
certain
jewels
once
so
precious
to
her
melted
up
and
put
together
with
the
eight
thousand
francs
paid
back
by
her
cousin
into
a
golden
pyx
which
she
gave
to
the
parish
church
where
she
had
so
long
prayed
for
she
now
spent
her
time
between
angers
and
saumur
her
husband
who
had
shown
some
public
spirit
on
a
certain
occasion
became
a
judge
in
the
superior
courts
and
finally
after
a
few
years
president
of
them
he
was
anxiously
awaiting
a
general
election
in
the
hope
of
being
returned
to
the
chamber
of
deputies
he
hankered
after
a
peerage
and
then
the
king
will
be
his
cousin
won
t
he
said
nanon
la
grande
nanon
madame
cornoiller
bourgeoise
of
saumur
as
she
listened
to
her
mistress
who
was
recounting
the
honors
to
which
she
was
called
nevertheless
monsieur
de
bonfons
he
had
finally
abolished
his
patronymic
of
cruchot
did
not
realize
any
of
his
ambitious
ideas
he
died
eight
days
after
his
election
as
deputy
of
saumur
god
who
sees
all
and
never
strikes
amiss
punished
him
no
doubt
for
his
sordid
calculations
and
the
legal
cleverness
with
which
he
had
drawn
up
his
marriage
contract
in
which
husband
and
wife
gave
to
each
other
in
case
they
should
have
no
children
their
entire
property
of
every
kind
landed
or
otherwise
without
exception
or
reservation
dispensing
even
with
the
formality
of
an
inventory
provided
that
said
omission
of
said
inventory
shall
not
injure
their
heirs
and
assigns
it
being
understood
that
this
deed
of
gift
is
this
clause
of
the
contract
will
explain
the
profound
respect
which
monsieur
le
president
always
testified
for
the
wishes
and
above
all
for
the
solitude
of
madame
de
bonfons
women
cited
him
as
the
most
considerate
and
delicate
of
men
pitied
him
and
even
went
so
far
as
to
find
fault
with
the
passion
and
grief
of
eugenie
blaming
her
as
women
know
so
well
how
to
blame
with
cruel
but
discreet
insinuation
madame
de
bonfons
must
be
very
ill
to
leave
her
husband
entirely
alone
poor
woman
is
she
likely
to
get
well
what
is
it
something
gastric
a
cancer
she
has
grown
perfectly
yellow
she
ought
to
consult
some
celebrated
doctor
in
how
can
she
be
happy
without
a
child
they
say
she
loves
her
husband
then
why
not
give
him
an
heir
in
his
position
too
do
you
know
it
is
really
dreadful
if
it
is
the
result
of
mere
caprice
it
is
unpardonable
poor
president
endowed
with
the
delicate
perception
which
a
solitary
soul
acquires
through
constant
meditation
through
the
exquisite
with
which
a
mind
aloof
from
life
fastens
on
all
that
falls
within
its
sphere
eugenie
taught
by
suffering
and
by
her
later
education
to
divine
thought
knew
well
that
the
president
desired
her
death
that
he
might
step
into
possession
of
their
immense
fortune
augmented
by
the
property
of
his
uncle
the
notary
and
his
uncle
the
abbe
whom
it
had
lately
pleased
god
to
call
to
himself
the
poor
solitary
pitied
the
president
providence
avenged
her
for
the
calculations
and
the
indifference
of
a
husband
who
respected
the
hopeless
passion
on
which
she
spent
her
life
because
it
was
his
surest
safeguard
to
give
life
to
a
child
would
give
death
to
his
hopes
the
hopes
of
selfishness
the
joys
of
ambition
which
the
president
cherished
as
he
looked
into
the
future
god
thus
flung
piles
of
gold
upon
this
prisoner
to
whom
gold
was
a
matter
of
indifference
who
longed
for
heaven
who
lived
pious
and
good
in
holy
thoughts
succoring
the
unfortunate
in
secret
and
never
wearying
of
such
deeds
madame
de
bonfons
became
a
widow
at
she
is
still
beautiful
but
with
the
beauty
of
a
woman
who
is
nearly
forty
years
of
age
her
face
is
white
and
placid
and
calm
her
voice
gentle
and
her
manners
are
simple
she
has
the
noblest
qualities
of
sorrow
the
saintliness
of
one
who
has
never
soiled
her
soul
by
contact
with
the
world
but
she
has
also
the
rigid
bearing
of
an
old
maid
and
the
petty
habits
inseparable
from
the
narrow
round
of
provincial
life
in
spite
of
her
vast
wealth
she
lives
as
the
poor
eugenie
grandet
once
lived
the
fire
is
never
lighted
on
her
hearth
until
the
day
when
her
father
allowed
it
to
be
lighted
in
the
hall
and
it
is
put
out
in
conformity
with
the
rules
which
governed
her
youthful
years
she
dresses
as
her
mother
dressed
the
house
in
saumur
without
sun
without
warmth
always
in
shadow
melancholy
is
an
image
of
her
life
she
carefully
accumulates
her
income
and
might
seem
parsimonious
did
she
not
disarm
criticism
by
a
noble
employment
of
her
wealth
pious
and
charitable
institutions
a
hospital
for
old
age
christian
schools
for
children
a
public
library
richly
endowed
bear
testimony
against
the
charge
of
avarice
which
some
persons
lay
at
her
door
the
churches
of
saumur
owe
much
of
their
embellishment
to
her
madame
de
bonfons
sometimes
ironically
spoken
of
as
mademoiselle
inspires
for
the
most
part
reverential
respect
and
yet
that
noble
heart
beating
only
with
tenderest
emotions
has
been
from
first
to
last
subjected
to
the
calculations
of
human
selfishness
money
has
cast
its
frigid
influence
upon
that
hallowed
life
and
taught
distrust
of
feelings
to
a
woman
who
is
all
feeling
i
have
none
but
you
to
love
me
she
says
to
nanon
the
hand
of
this
woman
stanches
the
secret
wounds
in
many
families
she
goes
on
her
way
to
heaven
attended
by
a
train
of
benefactions
the
grandeur
of
her
soul
redeems
the
narrowness
of
her
education
and
the
petty
habits
of
her
early
life
such
is
the
history
of
eugenie
grandet
who
is
in
the
world
but
not
of
it
who
created
to
be
supremely
a
wife
and
mother
has
neither
husband
nor
children
nor
family
lately
there
has
been
some
question
of
her
marrying
again
the
saumur
people
talk
of
her
and
of
the
marquis
de
froidfond
whose
family
are
beginning
to
beset
the
rich
widow
just
as
in
former
days
the

laid

to
the
rich
heiress
nanon

is
said
in

marquis
nothing
could
