miss

chapter
i
billy
writes
a
letter
billy
neilson
was
eighteen
years
old
when
the
aunt
who
had
brought
her
up
from
babyhood
died
miss
benton
death
left
billy
quite
alone
in
the
world
alone
and
peculiarly
forlorn
to
james
harding
of
harding
harding
who
had
charge
of
billy
not
inconsiderable
property
the
girl
poured
out
her
heart
in
all
its
loneliness
two
days
after
the
funeral
you
see
harding
there
is
any
one
not
any
one
who
cares
she
choked
tut
tut
my
child
it
not
so
bad
as
that
surely
remonstrated
the
old
man
gently
why
i
i
billy
smiled
through
eyes
but
i
ca
live
with
you
she
said
i
not
so
sure
of
that
either
retorted
the
man
i
thinking
that
letty
and
ann
would
like
to
have
you
with
the
girl
laughed
now
outright
she
was
thinking
of
miss
letty
who
had
nerves
and
of
miss
ann
who
had
a
heart
and
she
pictured
her
own
young
breezy
healthy
self
attempting
to
conform
to
the
hushed
and
shaded
thing
that
life
was
within
lawyer
harding
home
thank
you
but
i
sure
they
would
she
objected
you
do
know
how
noisy
i
the
lawyer
stirred
restlessly
and
pondered
but
surely
my
dear
is
there
some
relative
somewhere
he
demanded
how
about
your
mother
people
billy
shook
her
head
her
eyes
filled
again
with
tears
there
was
only
aunt
ella
ever
that
i
knew
anything
about
she
and
mother
were
the
only
children
there
were
and
mother
died
when
i
was
a
year
old
you
but
your
father
people
it
even
worse
there
he
was
an
only
child
and
an
orphan
when
mother
married
him
he
died
when
i
was
but
six
months
old
after
that
there
was
only
mother
and
aunt
ella
then
aunt
ella
alone
and
now
no
and
you
know
nothing
of
your
father
people
nothing
that
is
almost
then
there
is
some
one
billy
smiled
a
deeper
pink
showed
in
her
cheeks
why
there
one
a
man
but
he
is
really
father
people
anyway
but
i
i
have
been
tempted
to
write
to
who
is
he
the
one
i
named
for
he
was
father
boyhood
chum
you
see
that
why
i
instead
of
being
a
proper
or
or
jane
father
had
made
up
his
mind
to
name
his
baby
after
his
chum
and
when
i
came
aunt
ella
said
he
was
quite
until
somebody
hit
upon
the
idea
of
naming
me
billy
then
he
was
content
for
it
seems
that
he
always
called
his
chum
anyhow
and
so
i
am
do
you
know
this
man
no
you
see
father
died
and
mother
and
aunt
ella
knew
him
only
very
slightly
mother
knew
his
wife
though
aunt
ella
said
and
she
was
hm
well
we
might
look
them
up
perhaps
you
know
his
address
oh
yes
unless
he
moved
we
always
kept
that
aunt
ella
used
to
say
sometimes
that
she
was
going
to
write
to
him
some
day
about
me
you
what
his
name
william
henshaw
he
lives
in
lawyer
harding
snatched
off
his
glasses
and
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
william
henshaw
not
the
beacon
street
henshaws
he
cried
it
was
billy
turn
to
be
excited
she
too
leaned
forward
eagerly
oh
do
you
know
him
that
lovely
and
his
address
is
beacon
street
i
know
because
i
saw
it
only
you
see
i
have
been
tempted
to
write
write
him
of
course
you
write
him
cried
the
lawyer
and
we
need
to
do
much
up
there
child
i
known
the
family
for
years
and
this
william
was
a
college
mate
of
my
boy
nice
fellow
too
i
heard
ned
speak
of
him
there
were
three
sons
william
and
two
others
much
younger
than
he
i
forgotten
their
then
you
do
know
him
i
so
glad
exclaimed
billy
you
see
he
never
seemed
to
me
quite
i
know
about
him
corrected
the
lawyer
smilingly
though
confess
i
rather
lost
track
of
him
lately
ned
will
know
i
ask
ned
now
go
home
my
dear
and
dry
those
pretty
eyes
of
yours
or
better
still
come
home
with
me
to
tea
i
i
telephone
up
to
the
and
he
rose
stiffly
and
went
into
the
inner
office
some
minutes
passed
before
he
came
back
red
of
face
and
plainly
distressed
my
dear
child
i
i
sorry
but
but
i
have
to
take
back
that
invitation
he
blurted
out
miserably
my
sisters
are
are
not
well
this
afternoon
ann
has
been
having
a
turn
with
her
heart
you
know
ann
heart
is
is
bad
and
letty
letty
is
always
nervous
at
such
times
very
nervous
er
i
so
sorry
but
you
excuse
it
indeed
i
will
smiled
billy
and
thank
you
just
the
same
only
her
eyes
twinkled
mischievously
you
do
mind
if
i
do
say
that
it
is
lucky
that
we
had
gone
on
planning
to
have
me
live
with
them
harding
eh
well
er
i
think
your
plan
about
the
henshaws
is
very
good
he
interposed
hurriedly
i
speak
to
ned
i
speak
to
ned
he
finished
as
he
ceremoniously
bowed
the
girl
from
the
office
james
harding
kept
his
word
and
spoke
to
his
son
that
night
but
there
was
little
after
all
that
ned
could
tell
him
yes
he
remembered
billy
henshaw
well
but
he
had
not
heard
of
him
for
years
since
marriage
in
fact
he
must
be
forty
years
old
ned
said
but
he
was
a
fine
fellow
an
exceptionally
fine
fellow
and
would
be
sure
to
deal
kindly
and
wisely
by
his
little
orphan
namesake
of
that
ned
was
very
sure
that
good
i
write
him
declared
james
harding
i
write
him
he
did
write
but
not
so
soon
as
billy
wrote
for
even
as
he
spoke
billy
in
her
lonely
little
room
at
the
other
end
of
the
town
was
laying
bare
all
her
homesickness
in
four
long
pages
to
dear
uncle
chapter
ii
the
strata
bertram
henshaw
called
the
beacon
street
home
the
this
annoyed
cyril
and
even
william
not
a
little
though
they
reflected
that
after
all
it
was
only
for
the
whole
of
bertram
years
of
life
it
had
been
like
this
it
only
bertram
had
been
at
once
the
curse
and
the
salvation
of
his
existence
in
this
particular
case
however
bertram
vagary
of
fancy
had
some
excuse
the
beacon
street
house
the
home
of
the
three
brothers
was
a
you
see
it
like
this
bertram
would
explain
airily
to
some
new
acquaintance
who
expressed
surprise
at
the
name
if
i
could
slice
off
the
front
of
the
house
like
a
loaf
of
cake
you
understand
it
better
but
just
suppose
that
old
bunker
hill
should
suddenly
spout
fire
and
brimstone
and
bury
us
under
tons
of
ashes
only
fancy
the
condition
of
mind
of
those
future
archaeologists
when
they
struck
our
house
after
their
months
of
digging
what
would
they
find
listen
first
stratum
number
one
the
top
floor
that
cyril
you
know
they
note
the
bare
floors
the
sparse
but
heavy
furniture
the
piano
the
violin
the
flute
the
walls
and
the
absence
of
every
sort
of
curtain
cushion
or
knickknack
lived
a
plain
man
they
say
scholar
a
musician
stern
unloved
and
unloving
a
monk
and
what
next
they
strike
william
stratum
next
the
third
floor
imagine
it
you
know
william
as
a
state
street
broker
a
widower
tall
angular
slow
of
speech
a
little
bald
very
much
nearsighted
and
the
owner
of
the
kindest
heart
in
the
world
but
really
to
know
william
you
must
know
his
rooms
william
collects
things
he
has
always
collected
things
and
he
saved
every
one
of
them
there
a
tradition
that
at
the
age
of
one
year
he
crept
into
the
house
with
four
small
round
white
stones
anyhow
if
he
did
he
got
them
now
rest
assured
of
that
and
he
forty
this
year
miniatures
carved
ivories
bugs
moths
porcelains
jades
stamps
postcards
spoons
baggage
tags
theatre
programs
there
is
anything
that
he
collect
he
on
teapots
now
imagine
it
william
and
teapots
and
they
all
there
in
his
rooms
one
glorious
mass
of
confusion
just
fancy
those
archaeologists
trying
to
make
their
live
there
but
when
they
reach
me
my
stratum
they
have
a
worse
time
yet
you
see
like
cushions
and
comfort
and
i
have
them
everywhere
and
i
like
well
i
like
lots
of
things
my
rooms
do
belong
to
that
monk
not
a
little
bit
and
so
you
see
bertram
would
finish
merrily
why
i
call
it
all
strata
and
the
strata
it
was
to
all
the
henshaws
friends
and
even
to
william
and
cyril
themselves
in
spite
of
their
objection
to
the
term
from
babyhood
the
henshaw
boys
had
lived
in
the
handsome
roomy
house
facing
the
public
garden
it
had
been
their
father
boyhood
home
as
well
and
he
and
his
wife
had
died
there
soon
after
kate
the
only
daughter
had
married
at
the
age
of
william
henshaw
the
eldest
son
had
brought
his
bride
to
the
house
and
together
they
had
striven
to
make
a
home
for
the
two
younger
orphan
boys
cyril
twelve
and
bertram
six
but
william
after
a
short
five
years
of
married
life
had
died
and
since
then
the
house
had
known
almost
nothing
of
a
woman
touch
or
care
little
by
little
as
the
years
passed
the
house
and
its
inmates
had
fallen
into
what
had
given
bertram
his
excuse
for
the
name
cyril
thirty
years
old
now
dignified
reserved
averse
to
cats
dogs
women
and
confusion
had
early
taken
himself
and
his
music
to
the
peace
and
exclusiveness
of
the
fourth
floor
below
him
william
had
long
discouraged
any
meddling
with
his
precious
chaos
of
possessions
and
had
finally
come
to
spend
nearly
all
his
spare
time
among
them
this
left
bertram
to
undisputed
ownership
of
the
second
floor
and
right
royally
did
he
hold
sway
there
with
his
paints
and
brushes
and
easels
his
old
armor
rich
hangings
rugs
and
cushions
and
everywhere
his
specialty
his
face
of
a
from
canvas
plaque
and
panel
they
looked
out
those
girlish
faces
winsome
wilful
pert
demure
merry
sad
beautiful
even
almost
ugly
they
were
all
there
and
they
were
growing
famous
too
the
world
of
art
was
beginning
to
take
notice
and
to
adjust
its
spectacles
for
a
more
critical
glance
this
face
of
a
girl
by
henshaw
bade
fair
to
be
worth
while
below
bertram
cheery
second
floor
were
the
dim
old
library
and
silent
stately
and
almost
never
used
and
below
them
were
the
and
the
kitchen
here
ruled
dong
ling
the
chinese
cook
and
pete
pete
was
indeed
it
is
hard
telling
what
pete
was
he
said
he
was
the
butler
and
he
looked
the
part
when
he
answered
the
bell
at
the
great
front
door
but
at
other
times
when
he
swept
a
room
or
dusted
master
william
curios
he
looked
like
nothing
so
much
as
what
he
was
a
fussy
faithful
old
man
who
expected
to
die
in
the
service
he
had
entered
fifty
years
before
as
a
lad
thus
in
all
the
beacon
street
house
there
had
not
for
years
been
the
touch
of
a
woman
hand
even
kate
the
married
sister
had
long
since
given
up
trying
to
instruct
dong
ling
or
to
chide
pete
though
she
still
walked
across
the
garden
from
her
commonwealth
avenue
home
and
tripped
up
the
stairs
to
call
in
turn
upon
her
brothers
bertram
william
and
cyril
chapter
iii
the
strata
when
the
letter
comes
it
was
on
the
six
delivery
that
william
henshaw
received
the
letter
from
his
namesake
billy
to
say
the
least
the
letter
was
a
great
shock
to
him
he
had
not
quite
forgotten
billy
father
who
had
died
so
long
ago
it
is
true
but
he
had
forgotten
billy
entirely
even
as
he
looked
at
the
disconcerting
epistle
with
its
round
neatly
formed
letters
he
had
great
difficulty
in
ferreting
out
the
particular
niche
in
his
memory
which
contained
the
fact
that
walter
neilson
had
had
a
child
and
had
named
it
for
him
and
this
child
this
billy
this
unknown
progeny
of
an
all
but
forgotten
boyhood
friend
was
asking
a
home
and
with
him
impossible
and
william
henshaw
peered
at
the
letter
as
if
at
this
second
reading
its
message
could
not
be
so
monstrous
well
old
man
what
up
it
was
bertram
amazed
voice
from
the
hall
doorway
and
indeed
william
henshaw
and
plainly
trembling
seated
on
the
lowest
step
of
the
stairway
and
gazing
at
the
letter
in
his
hand
was
somewhat
of
an
amazing
sight
what
is
up
what
up
groaned
william
starting
to
his
feet
and
waving
the
letter
frantically
in
the
air
what
up
young
man
do
you
want
us
to
take
in
a
child
to
board
a
child
he
repeated
in
slow
horror
well
hardly
laughed
the
other
er
perhaps
cyril
might
like
it
though
eh
come
come
bertram
be
sensible
for
once
pleaded
his
brother
nervously
this
is
serious
really
serious
i
tell
you
what
is
serious
demanded
cyril
coming
down
the
stairway
ca
it
wait
pete
has
already
sounded
the
gong
twice
for
william
made
a
despairing
gesture
well
come
he
groaned
i
tell
you
at
the
table
it
seems
got
a
namesake
he
resumed
in
a
shaking
voice
a
few
moments
later
walter
neilson
and
who
walter
neilson
asked
bertram
a
boyhood
friend
you
would
remember
him
this
letter
is
from
his
well
let
hear
it
go
ahead
i
fancy
we
can
stand
the
letter
eh
cyril
cyril
frowned
cyril
did
not
know
perhaps
how
often
he
frowned
at
bertram
the
eldest
brother
wet
his
lips
his
hand
shook
as
he
picked
up
the
letter
it
it
so
absurd
he
muttered
then
he
cleared
his
throat
and
read
the
letter
aloud
dear
uncle
william
do
you
mind
my
calling
you
that
you
see
i
want
some
one
and
there
is
any
one
now
you
are
the
nearest
i
got
maybe
you
forgotten
but
i
named
for
you
walter
neilson
was
my
father
you
know
my
aunt
ella
has
just
died
would
you
mind
very
much
if
i
came
to
live
with
you
that
is
between
times
i
going
to
college
of
course
and
after
that
i
going
to
be
well
i
have
decided
that
part
yet
i
think
i
consult
you
you
may
have
some
preference
you
know
you
can
be
thinking
it
up
until
i
come
there
maybe
i
ought
not
to
have
said
that
for
perhaps
you
wo
want
me
to
come
i
am
noisy
i
own
but
not
so
i
think
you
mind
it
much
unless
some
of
you
have
or
a
you
see
miss
letty
and
miss
ann
they
harding
sisters
and
harding
is
our
lawyer
and
he
will
write
to
you
well
where
was
i
oh
i
know
on
miss
nerves
and
say
do

miss
letty
nerves
wo

except

tiptoe
and
miss
ann
heart
wo
let
you
speak
except
in
whispers
all
the
chairs
and
tables
have
worn
little
sockets
in
the
carpets
and
it
a
crime
to
move
them
there
is
a
in
the
house
that
is
pulled
down
exactly
to
the
middle
sash
except
where
the
sun
shines
and
those

pulled

spunk
living

and
oh

if

a
pink
in
your
buttonhole
i
will
too
then
we
know
each
other
my
address
is
just
falls
your
awfully
homesick
namesake
billy
henshaw
neilson
for
one
long
minute
there
was
a
blank
silence
about
the
henshaw
then
the
eldest
brother
looking
anxiously
from
one
man
to
the
other
stammered
great
scott
breathed
bertram
cyril
said
nothing
but
his
lips
were
white
with
their
tense
pressure
against
each
other
there
was
another
pause
and
again
william
broke
it
anxiously
boys
this
is
helping
me
out
any
what
to
be
done
flamed
cyril
surely
you
are
thinking
for
a
moment
of
letting
that
child
come
here
william
bertram
chuckled
he
would
liven
things
up
cyril
would
he
such
nice
smooth
floors
you
got
to
trundle
little
tin
carts
across
tin
nonsense
retorted
cyril
do
be
silly
bertram
that
letter
was
written
by
a
baby
he
be
much
more
likely
to
make
himself
at
home
with
your
paint
box
or
with
some
of
william
oh
i
say
expostulated
william
we
have
to
keep
him
out
of
those
things
you
cyril
pushed
back
his
chair
from
the
table
have
to
keep
him
out
william
you
ca
be
in
earnest
you
are
going
to
let
that
boy
come
here
he
cried
but
what
can
i
do
faltered
the
man
do
say
of
course
as
if
we
wanted
a
boy
to
bring
up
but
i
must
do
something
i
i
all
he
got
he
says
good
heavens
well
send
him
to
then
or
to
the
penitentiary
anywhere
but
here
shucks
let
the
kid
come
laughed
bertram
poor
little
homesick
devil
what
the
use
i
take
him
in
how
old
is
he
anyhow
william
frowned
and
mused
aloud
slowly
why
i
do
know
he
must
be
er
why
boys
he
no
child
broke
off
the
man
suddenly
walter
himself
died
seventeen
or
eighteen
years
ago
not
more
than
a
year
or
two
after
he
was
married
that
child
must
be
somewhere
around
eighteen
years
old
and
only
think
how
cyril
was
worrying
about
those
tin
carts
laughed
bertram
never
mind
eight
or
eighteen
let
him
come
if
he
that
age
he
wo
bother
and
this
er
do
you
take
him
too
but
probably
he
bother
either
murmured
cyril
with
smooth
sarcasm
gorry
i
forgot
spunk
acknowledged
bertram
say
what
in
time
is
spunk
do
you
suppose
dog
maybe
suggested
william
well
whatever
he
is
you
will
kindly
keep
spunk
said
cyril
with
decision
the
boy
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
endure
but
the
dog
well
judging
by
his
name
murmured
bertram
apologetically
it
may
be
just
possible
that
spunk
wo
be
easily
controlled
but
maybe
he
is
a
dog
anyhow
he
er
sounds
something
like
a
parrot
to
cyril
rose
to
his
feet
abruptly
he
had
eaten
almost
no
dinner
very
well
he
said
coldly
but
please
remember
that
i
hold
you
responsible
bertram
whether
it
a
dog
or
a
parrot
or
or
a
monkey
i
shall
expect
you
to
keep
spunk
this
adopting
into
the
family
an
unknown
boy
seems
to
me
very
absurd
from
beginning
to
end
but
if
you
and
william
will
have
it
so
of
course
i
nothing
to
say
fortunately
my
rooms
are
at
the
top
of
the
house
he
finished
as
he
turned
and
left
the
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
the
brows
of
the
younger
man
were
uplifted
quizzically
i
afraid
cyril
is
bothered
murmured
william
then
in
a
troubled
voice
bertram
face
changed
stern
lines
came
to
his
boyish
mouth
he
is
always
bothered
with
anything
the
elder
man
sighed
i
know
but
with
his
talent
great
scott
cut
in
bertram
half
the
world
has
talent
of
one
sort
or
another
but
that
does
necessarily
make
them
unable
to
live
with
any
one
else
really
will
it
becoming
serious
about
cyril
he
getting
to
be
for
all
the
world
like
those
finicky
old
maids
that
that
young
namesake
of
yours
wrote
about
he
make
us
whisper
and
walk
on
tiptoe
yet
the
other
smiled
do
you
worry
you
are
in
any
danger
of
being
kept
too
quiet
young
no
thanks
to
cyril
then
retorted
bertram
anyhow
that
one
reason
why
i
was
for
taking
the
kid
to
mellow
up
cyril
he
needs
it
all
but
i
had
to
take
him
bert
argued
the
elder
brother
his
face
growing
anxious
again
but
heaven
only
knows
what
i
going
to
do
with
him
when
i
get
him
what
shall
i
say
to
him
anyway
how
shall
i
write
i
do
know
how
to
get
up
a
letter
of
that
sort
why
not
take
him
at
his
word
and
telegraph
i
fancy
you
wo
have
to
say
but
once
before
you
see
him
he
does
seem
to
be
a
bashful
i
might
do
that
acquiesced
william
slowly
but
was
there
somebody
a
lawyer
going
to
write
to
me
he
finished
consulting
the
letter
by
his
plate
yes
he
added
after
a
moment
a
harding
wonder
if
he
any
relation
to
ned
harding
i
used
to
know
ned
at
harvard
and
seems
as
if
he
came
from
hampden
falls
we
soon
see
at
all
events
maybe
i
hear
i
should
wonder
nodded
bertram
as
he
rose
from
the
table
anyhow
i
would
do
anything
till
i
did
chapter
iv
billy
sends
a
telegram
james
harding
letter
very
promptly
followed
billy
though
it
was
not
like
billy
at
all
it
told
something
of
billy
property
and
mentioned
that
according
to
neilson
will
billy
would
not
come
into
control
of
her
fortune
until
the
age
of
years
was
reached
it
dwelt
at
some
length
upon
the
fact
of
billy
loneliness
in
the
world
and
expressed
the
hope
that
her
father
friend
could
find
it
in
his
heart
to
welcome
the
orphan
into
his
home
it
mentioned
ned
and
the
old
college
friendship
and
it
closed
by
saying
that
the
writer
james
harding
was
glad
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
the
good
old
henshaw
family
that
he
had
known
long
years
ago
and
that
he
hoped
soon
to
hear
from
william
henshaw
himself
it
was
a
good
letter
but
it
was
not
well
written
james
handwriting
was
not
distinguished
for
its
legibility
and
his
correspondents
rejoiced
that
the
most
of
his
letters
were
dictated
to
his
stenographer
in
this
case
however
he
had
elected
to
use
the
more
personal
pen
and
it
was
because
of
this
that
william
henshaw
even
after
reading
the
letter
was
still
unaware
of
his
mistake
in
supposing
his
namesake
billy
to
be
a
boy
in
the
main
the
lawyer
had
referred
to
billy
by
name
or
as
the
orphan
or
as
that
poor
lonely
and
whenever
the
more
distinctive
feminine
her
or
herself
had
occurred
the
carelessly
formed
letters
had
made
them
so
much
like
his
and
himself
that
they
carried
no
hint
of
the
truth
to
a
man
who
had
not
the
slightest
reason
for
thinking
himself
in
the
wrong
it
was
therefore
still
for
the
boy
billy
that
william
henshaw
at
once
set
about
making
a
place
in
the
home
first
he
telegraphed
the
single
word
come
to
billy
i
set
the
poor
lad
heart
at
rest
he
said
to
bertram
i
shall
answer
harding
letter
more
at
length
of
course
naturally
he
wants
to
know
something
about
me
now
before
he
sends
billy
along
but
there
is
no
need
for
the
boy
to
wait
before
he
knows
that
i
take
him
of
course
he
wo
come
yet
till
harding
hears
from
it
was
just
here
however
that
william
henshaw
met
with
a
surprise
for
within
hours
came
billy
answer
and
by
telegraph
i
coming
train
due
at
five
william
henshaw
did
not
know
that
in
hampden
falls
billy
trunk
had
been
packed
for
days
billy
was
desperate
the
house
even
with
the
maid
and
with
the
obliging
neighbor
and
his
wife
who
stayed
there
nights
was
to
billy
nothing
but
a
dismal
tomb
lawyer
harding
had
fallen
suddenly
ill
she
could
not
even
tell
him
that
the
blessed
telegram
come
had
arrived
hence
billy
lonely
impulsive
and
always
used
to
pleasing
herself
had
taken
matters
in
hand
with
a
confident
grasp
and
had
determined
to
wait
no
longer
that
it
was
a
fearsomely
unknown
future
to
which
she
was
so
jauntily
pledging
herself
did
not
trouble
the
girl
in
the
least
billy
was
romantic
to
sally
gaily
forth
with
a
pink
in
the
buttonhole
of
her
coat
to
find
her
father
friend
who
was
a
billy
too
seemed
to
billy
neilson
not
only
delightful
but
eminently
sensible
and
an
excellent
way
out
of
her
present
homesick
loneliness
so
she
bought
the
pink
and
her
ticket
and
impatiently
awaited
the
time
to
start
to
the
beacon
street
house
billy
cheerful
telegram
brought
the
direst
consternation
even
kate
was
hastily
summoned
to
the
family
conclave
that
immediately
resulted
there
nothing
simply
nothing
that
i
can
do
she
declared
irritably
when
she
had
heard
the
story
surely
you
do
expect
me
to
take
the
boy
no
no
of
course
not
sighed
william
but
you
see
i
supposed
have
time
to
to
get
used
to
things
and
to
make
arrangements
and
this
is
so
so
sudden
i
had
even
answered
harding
letter
until
and
he
has
got
that
much
less
replied
to
but
what
could
you
expect
after
sending
that
idiotic
telegram
demanded
the
lady
indeed
but
that
what
billy
told
me
to
what
if
it
was
just
because
a
foolish
boy
tells
you
to
do
something
must
you
a
supposedly
sensible
man
obey
i
think
it
tickled
will
romantic
streak
laughed
bertram
it
seemed
so
sort
of
alluring
to
send
that
one
word
out
into
space
and
watch
what
well
he
found
out
certainly
observed
cyril
with
grim
satisfaction
oh
no
it
has
happened
yet
corrected
bertram
cheerfully
just
going
to
happen
william
got
to
put
on
the
pink
first
you
know
that
the
william
reddened
bertram
do
be
foolish
i
wear
any
pink
you
must
know
how
you
find
him
then
why
he
have
one
on
that
enough
settled
william
maybe
then
he
have
spunk
too
murmured
bertram
mischievously
spunk
cried
kate
yes
he
wrote
that
he
hoped
we
would
mind
his
bringing
spunk
with
who
spunk
we
do
bertram
lips
twitched
you
do
know
what
do
you
mean
well
will
thinks
it
a
dog
and
i
believe
cyril
is
anticipating
a
monkey
i
myself
am
backing
it
for
a
boys
what
have
you
done
groaned
kate
falling
back
in
her
chair
what
have
you
done
to
william
her
words
were
like
an
electric
shock
stirring
him
to
instant
action
he
sprang
abruptly
to
his
feet
well
whatever
we
done
we
done
it
he
declared
sternly
and
now
we
must
do
the
rest
and
do
it
well
too
he
the
son
of
my
boyhood
dearest
friend
and
he
shall
be
made
welcome
now
to
business
bertram
you
said
you
take
him
in
did
you
mean
it
bertram
sobered
instantly
and
came
erect
in
his
chair
william
did
not
often
speak
like
this
but
when
he
did
yes
will
he
shall
have
the
little
bedroom
at
the
end
of
the
hall
i
never
used
the
room
much
anyhow
and
what
few
duds
i
have
there
shall
be
cleared
out
good
now
there
are
some
other
little
details
to
arrange
then
go
and
tell
pete
and
dong
ling
and
please
to
understand
we
going
to
make
this
lad
welcome
welcome
i
say
yes
sir
said
bertram
neither
kate
nor
cyril
spoke
chapter
v
getting
ready
for
billy
the
henshaw
household
was
early
astir
on
the
day
of
billy
expected
arrival
and
preparations
for
the
guest
comfort
were
well
under
way
before
breakfast
the
center
of
activity
was
in
the
little
room
at
the
end
of
the
hall
on
the
second
floor
though
as
bertram
said
the
whole
strata
felt
the
by
breakfast
time
bertram
with
the
avowed
intention
of
giving
the
little
chap
half
a
show
had
the
room
cleared
for
action
and
after
that
the
whole
house
was
called
upon
for
contributions
toward
the
adornment
and
most
generously
did
most
of
the
house
respond
even
dong
ling
slippered
and
presented
a
weird
chinese
banner
which
he
said
he
was
velly
much
glad
to
give
as
to
pete
pete
was
in
his
element
pete
loved
boys
had
he
not
served
them
nearly
all
his
life
incidentally
it
may
be
mentioned
that
he
did
not
care
for
girls
only
cyril
held
himself
aloof
but
that
he
was
not
oblivious
of
the
proceedings
below
him
was
evidenced
by
the
somber
bass
that
floated
down
from
his
piano
strings
cyril
always
played
according
to
the
mood
that
was
on
him
and
when
bertram
heard
this
morning
the
rhythmic
beats
of
mournfulness
he
chuckled
and
said
to
william
that
chopin
funeral
march
evidently
cy
thinks
this
is
the
death
knell
to
all
his
hopes
of
future
peace
and
dear
me
i
wish
cyril
would
take
some
interest
grieved
william
oh
he
takes
interest
all
right
laughed
bertram
meaningly
he
takes
interest
i
know
but
bertram
broke
off
the
elder
man
anxiously
from
his
perch
on
the
stepladder
would
you
put
the
rifle
over
this
window
or
the
why
i
do
think
it
makes
much
difference
so
long
as
somewhere
answered
bertram
and
there
are
these
indian
clubs
and
the
swords
to
be
disposed
of
you
yes
and
it
going
to
look
fine
do
you
think
exulted
william
and
you
know
for
the
between
the
windows
i
going
to
bring
down
that
case
of
mine
of
bertram
raised
his
hands
in
mock
surprise
here
down
here
you
going
to
trust
any
of
those
precious
treasures
of
yours
down
here
william
frowned
nonsense
bertram
do
be
silly
they
be
safe
enough
besides
they
old
anyhow
i
was
on
spiders
years
ago
when
i
was
billy
age
in
fact
i
thought
he
like
them
here
you
know
boys
always
like
such
oh
was
billy
i
was
worrying
about
retorted
bertram
it
was
you
and
the
not
much
you
worry
about
me
or
anything
else
replied
william
there
how
does
that
look
he
finished
as
he
carefully
picked
his
way
down
the
stepladder
fine
er
only
rather
warlike
maybe
with
the
guns
and
that
riotous
confusion
of
knives
and
scimitars
over
the
chiffonier
but
then
maybe
you
intending
billy
for
a
soldier
eh
do
you
know
i
am
getting
interested
in
that
boy
beamed
william
with
some
excitement
what
kind
of
things
do
you
suppose
he
does
like
there
no
telling
maybe
he
a
sissy
chap
and
will
howl
at
your
guns
and
spiders
perhaps
he
prefer
autumn
leaves
and
worsted
mottoes
for
not
much
he
will
contested
the
other
no
son
of
walter
could
be
a
sissy
neilson
was
the
best
in
ten
years
at
harvard
and
he
was
always
in
for
everything
going
that
was
worth
while
leaves
and
worsted
mottoes
indeed
bah
all
right
but
there
still
a
dark
horse
in
the
case
you
know
we
must
forget
the
elder
man
stirred
uneasily
bert
what
do
you
suppose
that
creature
is
you
do
think
cyril
can
be
right
and
that
it
a
monkey
never
can
tell
quoted
bertram
merrily
of
course
there
are
other
things
if
it
were
you
now
we
only
have
to
hunt
up
the
special
thing
you
happened
to
be
collecting
at
the
time
and
that
would
be
it
a
snake
a
lizard
a
toad
or
maybe
a
butterfly
you
know
you
were
always
lugging
those
things
home
when
you
were
his
yes
i
know
sighed
william
but
i
ca
think
it
anything
like
that
he
finished
as
he
turned
away
there
was
very
little
done
in
the
beacon
street
house
that
day
but
to
get
ready
for
in
the
kitchen
dong
ling
cooked
everywhere
else
except
in
cyril
domain
pete
dusted
and
swept
and
puttered
to
his
heart
content
william
did
not
go
to
the
office
at
all
that
day
and
bertram
did
not
touch
his
brushes
only
cyril
attended
to
his
usual
work
practising
for
a
coming
concert
and
correcting
the
proofs
of
his
new
book
music
in
at
ten
minutes
before
five
william
and
nervous
found
himself
at
the
north
station
then
and
not
till
then
did
he
draw
a
long
breath
of
relief
there
i
think
everything
ready
he
sighed
to
himself
at
last
he
wore
no
pink
in
his
buttonhole
there
was
no
need
that
he
should
accede
to
that
silly
request
he
told
himself
he
had
only
to
look
for
a
youth
of
perhaps
eighteen
years
who
would
be
alone
a
little
frightened
possibly
and
who
would
have
a
pink
in
his
buttonhole
and
probably
a
dog
on
a
leash
as
he
waited
the
man
was
conscious
of
a
curious
warmth
at
his
heart
it
was
his
namesake
walter
neilson
boy
that
he
had
come
to
meet
a
homesick
lonely
orphan
who
had
appealed
to
him
to
him
out
of
all
the
world
long
years
ago
in
his
own
arms
there
had
been
laid
a
tiny
bundle
of
flannel
holding
a
precious
little
red
puckered
face
but
in
a
month
time
the
little
face
had
turned
cold
and
waxen
and
the
hopes
that
the
white
flannel
bundle
had
carried
had
died
with
the
baby
boy
and
that
baby
would
have
been
a
lad
grown
by
this
time
if
he
had
lived
a
lad
not
far
from
the
age
of
this
billy
who
was
coming
reflected
the
man
and
the
warmth
in
his
heart
deepened
and
glowed
the
more
as
he
stood
waiting
at
the
gate
for
billy
to
arrive
the
train
from
hampden
falls
was
late
not
until
quite
fifteen
minutes
past
five
did
it
roll
into
the
then
at
once
its
long
line
of
passengers
began
to
sweep
toward
the
iron
gate
william
was
just
inside
the
gate
now
anxiously
scanning
every
face
and
form
that
passed
there
were
many
lads
but
there
was
not
one
with
a
pink
in
his
buttonhole
until
very
near
the
end
then
william
saw
him
a
boy
in
a
neat
gray
suit
with
a
low
cry
william
started
forward
but
he
saw
at
once
that
the
youth
was
unmistakably
one
of
a
merry
family
party
he
looked
to
be
anything
but
a
lad
that
was
lonely
and
forlorn
william
hesitated
and
fell
back
this
debonair
fellow
could
not
be
billy
but
as
a
hasty
glance
down
the
line
revealed
only
half
a
dozen
straggling
women
and
beyond
them
no
one
william
decided
that
it
must
be
billy
and
taking
brave
hold
of
his
courage
he
hurried
after
the
youth
and
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
er
are
you
billy
he
stammered
the
lad
stopped
and
stared
he
shook
his
head
slowly
no
sir
he
said
but
you
must
be
are
you
sure
the
boy
laughed
this
time
sorry
sir
but
my
name
is
is
it
mother
he
added
merrily
turning
to
the
lady
at
his
side
who
was
regarding
william
very
unfavorably
through
a
pair
of
spectacles
william
did
not
wait
for
more
with
a
stammered
apology
and
a
flustered
lifting
of
his
hat
he
backed
away
but
where
was
billy
william
looked
about
him
in
helpless
dismay
all
around
was
a
wide
empty
space
the
long
aisle
to
the
hampden
falls
train
was
deserted
save
for
the
loading
the
trunks
and
bags
on
to
their
trucks
nowhere
was
there
any
one
who
seemed
forlorn
or
ill
at
ease
except
a
pretty
girl
with
a
and
with
a
covered
basket
on
her
arm
who
stood
just
outside
the
gate
gazing
a
little
nervously
about
her
william
looked
twice
at
this
girl
first
because
the
splash
of
color
against
her
brown
coat
had
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
she
was
wearing
a
pink
and
secondly
because
she
was
very
pretty
and
her
dark
eyes
carried
a
peculiarly
wistful
appeal
too
bad
bertram
is
here
thought
william
he
be
sketching
that
face
in
no
time
on
his
the
pink
had
given
william
almost
a
pang
he
had
been
so
longing
to
see
a
pink
though
in
a
different
place
he
wondered
sympathetically
if
she
too
had
come
to
meet
some
one
who
had
not
appeared
he
noticed
that
she
walked
away
from
the
gate
once
or
twice
toward
the
and
peered
anxiously
through
the
glass
doors
but
always
she
came
back
to
the
gate
as
if
fearful
to
be
long
away
from
that
place
he
forgot
all
about
her
very
soon
for
her
movements
had
given
him
a
sudden
idea
perhaps
billy
was
in
the
how
stupid
of
him
not
to
think
of
it
before
doubtless
they
had
missed
each
other
in
the
crowd
and
billy
had
gone
straight
to
the
to
look
for
him
and
with
this
thought
william
hurried
away
at
once
leaving
the
girl
still
standing
by
the
gate
alone
he
looked
everywhere
systematically
he
paced
up
and
down
between
the
long
rows
of
seats
looking
for
a
boy
with
a
pink
he
even
went
out
upon
the
street
and
gazed
anxiously
in
all
directions
it
occurred
to
him
after
a
time
that
possibly
billy
like
himself
had
changed
his
mind
at
the
last
moment
and
not
worn
the
pink
perhaps
he
had
forgotten
it
or
lost
it
or
even
not
been
able
to
get
it
at
all
very
bitterly
william
blamed
himself
then
for
disregarding
his
own
part
of
the
suggested
plan
if
only
he
had
worn
the
pink
himself
but
he
had
not
and
it
was
useless
to
repine
in
the
meantime
where
was
billy
he
wondered
frantically
chapter
vi
the
coming
of
billy
after
another
long
search
william
came
back
to
the
vaguely
hoping
that
billy
might
even
then
be
there
the
girl
was
still
standing
alone
by
the
gate
there
was
another
train
on
the
track
now
and
the
rush
of
many
feet
had
swept
her
a
little
to
one
side
she
looked
frightened
now
and
almost
ready
to
cry
still
william
noticed
that
her
chin
was
lifted
bravely
and
that
she
was
making
a
stern
effort
at
he
hesitated
a
moment
then
went
straight
toward
her
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
kindly
lifting
his
hat
but
i
notice
that
you
have
been
waiting
here
some
time
perhaps
there
is
something
i
can
do
for
a
rosy
color
swept
to
the
girl
face
her
eyes
lost
their
frightened
appeal
and
smiled
frankly
into
his
oh
thank
you
sir
there
is
something
you
can
do
for
me
if
you
will
be
so
kind
you
see
i
ca
leave
this
place
i
so
afraid
come
and
i
miss
him
but
i
think
there
some
mistake
could
you
telephone
for
me
billy
neilson
was
and
in
hampden
falls
all
men
served
all
other
men
and
women
whether
they
were
strangers
or
not
so
to
billy
this
was
not
an
extraordinary
request
to
make
in
the
least
william
henshaw
smiled
certainly
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
telephone
for
you
just
tell
me
whom
you
want
and
what
you
want
to
thank
you
if
you
call
up
william
henshaw
then
of
beacon
street
please
and
tell
him
billy
come
i
wait
oh
then
billy
did
come
cried
the
man
in
glad
surprise
his
face
alight
but
where
is
he
do
you
know
billy
i
should
say
i
did
laughed
billy
with
the
lightness
of
a
child
who
has
found
a
friend
why
i
am
billy
myself
to
william
henshaw
the
world
swam
dizzily
and
went
suddenly
mad
the
floor
rose
and
the
roof
fell
while
cars
and
people
performed
impossible
acrobatic
feats
above
below
and
around
him
then
from
afar
off
he
heard
his
own
voice
stammer
you
are
yes
and
i
wait
here
if
you
just
tell
him
please
expecting
me
you
know
so
it
all
right
only
perhaps
he
made
a
mistake
in
the
time
maybe
you
know
him
with
one
mighty
effort
william
henshaw
pulled
himself
sharply
together
he
even
laughed
and
tossed
his
head
in
a
valiant
imitation
of
billy
herself
but
his
voice
shook
know
him
i
should
say
i
did
he
cried
why
i
am
william
henshaw
you
uncle
william
why
where
your
pink
the
man
face
was
already
so
red
it
could
not
get
any
redder
but
it
tried
to
do
so
why
er
i
it
er
if
you
just
come
into
the
a
minute
my
dear
he
stuttered
miserably
i
i
explain
about
that
i
shall
have
to
leave
you
for
a
minute
he
plunged
on
frenziedly
as
he
led
the
way
to
a
seat
a
matter
of
business
that
i
must
attend
to
be
right
back
wait
here
please
and
he
almost
pushed
the
girl
into
a
seat
and
hurried
away
at
a
safe
distance
william
henshaw
turned
and
looked
back
his
knees
were
shaking
and
his
fingers
had
grown
cold
at
their
tips
he
could
see
her
plainly
as
she
bent
over
the
basket
in
her
lap
he
could
see
even
the
pretty
curve
of
her
cheek
and
of
her
slender
throat
when
she
lifted
her
head
and
that
was
billy
a
girl
people
near
him
at
that
moment
saw
a
man
throw
up
his
hands
with
a
despairing
gesture
roll
his
eyes
heavenward
and
then
plunge
into
the
nearest
telephone
booth
in
due
time
william
henshaw
had
his
brother
bertram
at
the
other
end
of
the
wire
bertram
he
called
shakily

against

hook
chapter
vii
introducing
spunk
in
the
soft
april
twilight
cyril
was
playing
a
dreamy
waltz
when
bertram
knocked
and
pushed
open
the
door
say
old
chap
you
have
to
quit
your
mooning
this
time
and
sit
up
and
take
what
do
you
mean
cyril
stopped
playing
and
turned
abruptly
i
mean
that
will
has
gone
crazy
and
i
think
the
rest
of
us
are
going
to
follow
cyril
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
whirled
about
on
the
piano
stool
in
a
moment
his
fingers
had
slid
once
more
into
the
dreamy
waltz
when
you
get
ready
to
talk
sense
i
listen
he
said
coldly
oh
very
well
if
you
really
want
it
broken
gently
it
this
will
has
met
billy
and
billy
is
a
girl
they
due
here
now
any
the
music
stopped
with
a
crash
a
girl
yes
a
girl
oh
i
been
all
through
that
and
i
know
how
you
feel
but
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
it
really
so
i
had
instructions
to
tell
everybody
and
i
told
i
got
kate
on
the
telephone
and
coming
over
you
know
what
she
be
dong
ling
is
having
what
i
suppose
are
chinese
hysterics
in
the
kitchen
and
pete
is
swinging
back
and
forth
like
a
pendulum
in
the
moaning
lord
deliver
us
at
every
breath
i
would
suggest
that
you
follow
me
so
that
we
may
be
decently
ready
for
whatever
and
he
turned
about
and
stalked
out
of
the
room
followed
by
cyril
who
was
too
stunned
to
open
his
lips
kate
came
first
she
was
not
stunned
she
had
a
great
deal
to
say
really
this
is
a
little
the
most
absurd
thing
i
ever
heard
of
she
fumed
what
in
the
world
does
your
brother
mean
that
she
quite
ignored
her
own
relationship
to
the
culprit
was
not
lost
on
bertram
he
made
instant
response
as
near
as
i
can
make
out
he
replied
smoothly
your
brother
has
fallen
under
the
sway
of
a
pair
of
great
dark
eyes
two
pink
cheeks
and
an
unknown
quantity
of
curly
hair
all
of
which
in
its
entirety
is
his
namesake
is
lonesome
and
is
in
need
of
a
but
she
ca
live
here
will
says
she
but
that
is
utter
nonsense
cut
in
cyril
for
once
i
agree
with
you
cyril
laughed
bertram
but
william
but
how
can
she
do
it
demanded
kate
do
know
answered
bertram
he
established
a
petticoat
propriety
in
you
for
a
few
hours
at
least
meanwhile
he
going
to
think
at
least
he
says
he
is
and
that
we
got
to
help
humph
snapped
kate
well
i
can
prophesy
we
think
alike
so
you
notice
it
i
know
that
nodded
bertram
and
i
with
you
and
cyril
on
this
the
whole
thing
is
absurd
the
idea
of
thrusting
a
silly
girl
here
into
our
lives
in
this
fashion
but
you
know
what
will
is
when
he
really
roused
you
might
as
well
try
to
move
a
nice
mountain
by
saying
as
to
try
to
stir
him
under
certain
circumstances
most
of
the
time
i
own
we
can
twist
him
around
our
little
fingers
but
not
now
you
see
in
the
first
place
she
the
daughter
of
his
dead
friend
and
she
did
write
a
pathetic
little
letter
it
got
to
the
inside
of
me
anyhow
when
i
thought
she
was
a
a
boy
who
would
think
she
was
a
boy
interposed
cyril
indeed
can
you
tell
me
what
for
any
sane
man
should
have
named
a
girl
for
william
your
brother
evidently
retorted
bertram
dryly
anyhow
he
did
it
and
of
course
our
mistake
was
a
very
natural
one
the
dickens
of
it
is
now
that
we
got
to
keep
it
from
her
so
will
says
and
how
hush
here
they
are
he
broke
off
as
there
came
the
sound
of
wheels
stopping
before
the
house
there
followed
the
click
of
a
key
in
the
lock
and
the
opening
of
a
heavy
door
then
full
in
the
glare
of
the
electric
lights
stood
a
plainly
nervous
man
and
a
girl
with
startled
appealing
eyes
my
dear
stammered
william
this
is
my
sister
kate
hartwell
and
here
are
cyril
and
bertram
whom
i
told
you
of
and
of
course
i
do
need
to
say
to
them
that
you
are
it
was
over
william
drew
a
long
breath
and
gave
an
agonized
look
into
his
brothers
eyes
then
billy
turned
from
hartwell
and
held
out
a
cordial
hand
to
each
of
the
men
in
turn
oh
you
do
know
how
lovely
this
is
to
me
she
cried
softly
and
to
think
that
you
were
willing
i
should
come
the
two
younger
men
caught
their
breath
sharply
and
tried
not
to
see
each
other
eyes
you
look
so
good
all
of
you
and
i
do
believe
there
one
of
you
that
got
nerves
or
a
heart
she
laughed
bertram
rallied
his
wits
to
respond
to
the
challenge
no
heart
miss
billy
now
is
that
just
a
bit
hard
on
us
right
at
first
not
a
mite
if
you
take
it
the
way
i
mean
it
dimpled
billy
hearts
that
are
all
right
just
keep
on
pumping
and
you
never
know
they
are
there
they
are
worth
mentioning
it
the
other
kind
the
kind
that
flutters
at
the
least
noise
and
jumps
at
the
least
bang
and
i
believe
any
of
you
mind
noises
and
bangs
she
finished
merrily
as
she
handed
her
hat
and
coat
to
hartwell
who
was
waiting
to
receive
them
bertram
laughed
cyril
scowled
and
occupied
himself
in
finding
a
chair
william
had
already
dropped
himself
wearily
on
to
the
sofa
near
his
sister
billy
still
continued
to
talk
now
when
spunk
and
i
get
to
training
oh
and
you
have
seen
spunk
she
interrupted
herself
suddenly
why
the
introductions
are
half
over
where
is
he
uncle
william
the
basket
i
i
put
it
in
in
the
hall
mumbled
william
starting
to
rise
no
no
i
get
him
cried
billy
hurrying
from
the
room
she
returned
in
a
moment
the
green
covered
basket
in
her
hand
he
been
asleep
i
guess
he
slept
all
the
way
down
anyhow
he
so
used
to
being
toted
in
this
basket
that
he
does
mind
it
a
bit
i
take
him
everywhere
in
it
at
the
there
was
an
electric
pause
four
pairs
of
startled
questioning
fearful
eyes
were
on
the
basket
while
billy
fumbled
at
the
knot
of
the
string
the
next
moment
with
a
triumphant
flourish
billy
lifted
from
the
basket
and
placed
on
the
floor
a
very
small
gray
kitten
with
a
very
large
pink
bow
there
ladies
and
gentlemen
may
i
present
to
you
the
tiny
creature
winked
and
blinked
and
balanced
for
a
moment
on
sleepy
legs
then
at
the
uncontrollable
shout
that
burst
from
throat
he
faced
the
man
humped
his
tiny
back
bristled
his
diminutive
tail
to
almost
unbelievable
fluffiness
and
spit
wrathfully
and
so
that
is
spunk
choked
bertram
yes
said
billy
this
is
chapter
viii
the
room
and
billy
for
the
first
fifteen
minutes
after
billy
arrival
conversation
was
a
fitful
thing
made
up
mostly
of
a
merry
monologue
on
the
part
of
billy
herself
interspersed
with
somewhat
dazed
replies
from
one
after
another
of
her
auditors
as
she
talked
to
them
in
turn
no
one
thought
to
ask
if
she
cared
to
go
up
to
her
room
and
during
the
entire
fifteen
minutes
billy
sat
on
the
floor
with
spunk
in
her
lap
she
was
still
there
when
the
funereal
face
of
pete
appeared
in
the
doorway
pete
jaw
dropped
it
was
plain
that
only
the
sternest
enabled
him
to
announce
dinner
with
anything
like
dignity
but
he
managed
to
stammer
out
the
words
and
then
turn
loftily
away
bertram
who
sat
near
the
door
however
saw
him
raise
his
hands
in
horror
as
he
plunged
through
the
hall
and
down
the
stairway
with
a
motion
to
bertram
to
lead
the
way
with
billy
william
frenziedly
gripped
his
sister
arm
and
hissed
in
her
ear
for
all
the
world
like
a
villain
in
melodrama
listen
you
sleep
in
bert
room
and
bert
will
come
with
me
get
billy
to
bed
as
soon
as
you
can
after
dinner
and
then
come
back
down
to
us
we
got
to
plan
what
got
to
be
done
and
he
dragged
his
sister
downstairs
in
the
there
was
a
slight
commotion
billy
stood
at
her
chair
with
spunk
in
her
arms
before
her
pete
was
standing
dumbly
staring
into
her
eyes
at
last
he
stammered
a
chair
please
i
said
for
spunk
you
know
spunk
always
sits
at
the
table
right
next
to
it
was
too
much
for
bertram
he
fled
chokingly
to
the
hall
william
dropped
weakly
into
his
own
place
cyril
stared
as
had
pete
but
hartwell
spoke
you
do
mean
that
that
cat
has
a
chair
at
the
table
she
gasped
yes
and
is
it
cute
of
him
beamed
billy
entirely
misconstruing
the
surprise
in
the
lady
voice
his
mother
always
sat
at
table
with
us
and
behaved
beautifully
too
of
course
spunk
is
little
and
makes
mistakes
sometimes
but
he
learn
oh
there
a
chair
right
here
she
added
as
she
spied
bertram
childhood
which
for
long
years
had
stood
unused
in
the
corner
i
just
squeeze
it
right
in
here
she
finished
gleefully
making
room
for
the
chair
at
her
side
when
bertram
a
little
red
of
face
but
very
grave
entered
the
a
moment
later
he
found
the
family
seated
with
spunk
snugly
placed
between
billy
and
a
plainly
disgusted
and
dismayed
brother
cyril
the
kitten
was
alert
and
interested
but
he
had
settled
back
in
his
chair
and
was
looking
as
absurdly
dignified
as
the
flaring
pink
bow
would
let
him
is
he
a
dear
billy
was
saying
but
bertram
noticed
that
there
was
no
reply
to
this
question
it
was
a
peculiar
only
billy
did
not
feel
the
strain
even
spunk
was
not
entirely
happy
his
efforts
to
investigate
the
table
and
its
contents
were
too
frequently
curbed
by
his
mistress
for
his
unalloyed
satisfaction
william
it
is
true
made
a
valiant
attempt
to
cause
the
conversation
to
be
general
but
he
failed
dismally
kate
was
sternly
silent
while
cyril
was
openly
repellent
bertram
talked
indeed
but
bertram
always
talked
and
very
soon
he
and
billy
had
things
pretty
much
to
themselves
that
is
with
occasional
interruptions
caused
by
spunk
spunk
had
an
inquisitive
nose
or
paw
for
each
new
dish
placed
before
his
mistress
and
billy
spent
much
time
admonishing
him
billy
said
she
was
training
him
that
it
was
wonderful
what
training
would
do
and
of
course
spunk
was
little
now
dinner
was
half
over
when
there
was
a
slight
diversion
created
by
spunk
conclusion
to
get
acquainted
with
the
silent
man
at
his
left
cyril
however
did
not
respond
to
spunk
advances
so
very
evident
indeed
was
the
man
aversion
that
billy
turned
in
amazement
why
cyril
do
you
see
spunk
is
trying
to
say
do
you
do
very
likely
but
i
not
fond
of
cats
miss
you
not
fond
of
cats
repeated
the
girl
as
if
she
could
not
have
heard
aright
why
not
cyril
changed
his
position
why
just
because
i
i
not
he
retorted
lamely
is
there
anything
that
that
you
do
like
billy
considered
why
not
that
i
know
of
she
began
after
a
moment
only
rainy
days
and
tripe
and
spunk
is
a
bit
like
bertram
chuckled
and
even
cyril
smiled
though
unwillingly
all
the
same
he
reiterated
i
do
like
oh
i
so
sorry
lamented
billy
and
at
the
grieved
hurt
in
her
dark
eyes
bertram
came
promptly
to
the
rescue
never
mind
miss
billy
cyril
is
only
one
of
us
and
there
is
all
the
rest
of
the
strata
the
what
the
strata
you
do
know
of
course
but
listen
and
i
tell
and
he
launched
gaily
forth
into
his
favorite
story
billy
was
duly
amused
and
interested
she
laughed
and
clapped
her
hands
and
when
the
story
was
done
she
clapped
them
again
oh
what
a
funny
house
and
how
perfectly
lovely
that
i
going
to
live
in
it
she
cried
then
straight
at
hartwell
she
hurled
a
bombshell
but
where
is
your
stratum
she
demanded
mr
bertram
did
mention
a
thing
about
you
cyril
said
a
sharp
word
under
his
breath
bertram
choked
over
a
cough
kate
threw
into
william
eyes
a
look
that
was
at
once
angry
accusing
and
despairing
then
william
spoke
er
she
it
is
anywhere
my
dear
he
stammered
or
rather
it
is
here
kate
lives
up
on
the
avenue
you
see
and
is
only
here
for
for
a
day
or
two
just
oh
murmured
billy
and
there
was
not
one
in
the
room
at
that
moment
who
did
not
bless
spunk
for
spunk
suddenly
leaped
to
the
table
before
him
and
in
the
ensuing
confusion
his
mistress
quite
forgot
to
question
further
concerning
hartwell
stratum
dinner
over
the
three
men
with
their
sister
and
billy
trailed
to
the
billy
told
them
then
of
her
life
at
hampden
falls
she
cried
a
little
at
the
mention
of
aunt
ella
and
she
portrayed
very
vividly
the
lonely
life
from
which
she
herself
had
so
gladly
escaped
she
soon
had
every
one
laughing
even
cyril
over
her
stories
of
the
lawyer
home
that
might
have
been
hers
with
its
gloom
and
its
hush
and
its
socketed
chairs
as
soon
as
possible
however
hartwell
with
a
murmured
i
know
you
must
be
tired
billy
suggested
that
the
girl
go
to
her
room
come
she
added
i
will
show
you
the
there
was
some
delay
even
then
for
spunk
had
to
be
provided
with
sleeping
quarters
and
it
was
not
without
some
hesitation
that
billy
finally
placed
the
kitten
in
the
reluctant
hands
of
pete
who
had
been
hastily
summoned
then
she
turned
and
followed
hartwell
it
seemed
to
the
three
men
in
the
that
almost
immediately
came
the
piercing
shriek
and
the
excited
voice
of
their
sister
in
expostulation
without
waiting
for
more
they
leaped
to
the
stairway
and
hurried
up
two
steps
at
a
time
for
heaven
sake
kate
what
is
it
panted
william
who
had
been
outdistanced
by
his
more
agile
brothers
kate
was
on
her
feet
her
face
the
picture
of
distressed
amazement
in
the
low
chair
by
the
window
billy
sat
where
she
had
flung
herself
her
hands
over
her
face
her
shoulders
were
shaking
and
from
her
throat
came
choking
little
cries
i
do
know
quavered
kate
i
have
the
least
idea
she
was
all
right
till
she
got
here
and
i
turned
on
the
lights
then
she
gave
one
shriek
and
you
know
all
i
william
advanced
hurriedly
billy
what
is
the
matter
what
are
you
crying
for
he
demanded
billy
dropped
her
hands
then
and
they
saw
her
face
she
was
not
crying
she
was
laughing
she
was
laughing
so
she
could
scarcely
speak
oh
you
did
you
did
she
gurgled
i
thought
you
did
and
now
i
know
did
what
what
do
you
mean
william
usually
gentle
voice
was
sharp
even
william
nerves
were
beginning
to
feel
the
strain
of
the
last
few
hours
thought
i
was
a
choked
billy
you
called
me
once
in
the
station
i
thought
you
did
but
i
was
sure
not
till
i
saw
this
room
but
now
i
know
i
know
and
off
she
went
into
another
hysterical
gale
of
laughter
billy
nerves
too
were
beginning
to
respond
to
the
excitement
of
the
last
few
hours
as
to
the
three
men
and
the
woman
they
stood
silent
helpless
looking
into
each
other
faces
with
despairing
eyes
in
a
moment
billy
was
on
her
feet
fluttering
about
the
room
touching
this
thing
looking
at
that
nothing
escaped
her
i
to
fish
and
shoot
and
fence
she
crowed
and
oh
look
at
those
knives
and
my
what
are
these
she
cried
pouncing
on
the
indian
clubs
and
look
at
the
spiders
dear
dear
i
am
glad
they
dead
anyhow
she
shuddered
with
a
nervous
laugh
that
was
almost
a
sob
something
in
billy
voice
stirred
hartwell
to
sudden
action
come
come
this
will
never
do
she
protested
authoritatively
motioning
her
brothers
to
leave
the
room
billy
is
quite
tired
out
and
needs
rest
she
must
talk
another
bit
of
not
stammered
william
and
only
too
glad
of
an
excuse
to
withdraw
from
a
very
embarrassing
situation
the
three
men
called
back
a
faltering
and
precipitately
fled
chapter
ix
a
family
conclave
well
william
greeted
kate
grimly
when
she
came
into
the
after
putting
her
charge
to
bed
have
you
had
enough
now
what
do
you
mean
kate
raised
her
eyebrows
why
surely
you
not
thinking
now
that
you
can
keep
this
girl
here
are
you
i
do
know
why
william
well
where
shall
she
go
will
you
take
her
i
certainly
not
declared
kate
with
decision
i
sure
i
see
no
reason
why
i
no
more
do
i
see
why
william
should
either
cut
in
cyril
oh
come
what
the
use
interposed
bertram
let
her
stay
she
a
nice
little
thing
i
cyril
and
kate
turned
sharply
bertram
the
cry
was
a
duet
of
angry
amazement
then
kate
added
it
seems
that
you
too
have
come
under
the
sway
of
dark
eyes
pink
cheeks
and
an
unknown
quantity
of
curly
hair
bertram
laughed
oh
well
she
would
be
nice
to
er
paint
he
murmured
see
here
children
demurred
william
a
little
sternly
all
this
is
wasting
time
there
is
no
way
out
of
it
i
would
be
seen
turning
that
homeless
child
away
now
we
must
keep
her
that
settled
the
question
is
how
shall
it
be
done
we
must
have
some
woman
friend
here
to
be
her
companion
of
course
but
whom
shall
we
get
kate
sighed
and
looked
her
dismay
bertram
threw
a
glance
into
eyes
and
made
an
expressive
gesture
you
see
it
seemed
to
say
i
told
you
how
it
would
be
now
whom
shall
we
get
questioned
william
again
we
must
unattached
gentlewomen
of
suitable
age
and
desirable
temper
did
not
prove
to
be
so
numerous
among
the
henshaws
acquaintances
however
as
to
make
the
selection
of
a
chaperon
very
easy
several
were
thought
of
and
suggested
but
in
each
case
the
candidate
was
found
to
possess
one
or
more
characteristics
that
made
the
idea
of
her
presence
utterly
abhorrent
to
some
one
of
the
brothers
at
last
william
expostulated
see
here
boys
we
are
any
nearer
a
settlement
than
we
were
in
the
first
place
there
is
any
woman
of
course
who
would
exactly
suit
all
of
us
and
so
we
shall
just
have
to
be
willing
to
take
some
one
who
the
trouble
is
explained
bertram
airily
we
want
some
one
who
will
be
invisible
to
every
one
except
the
world
and
billy
and
who
will
be
inaudible
i
do
know
but
you
are
right
sighed
william
but
suppose
we
settle
on
aunt
hannah
she
seems
to
be
the
least
objectionable
of
the
lot
and
i
think
she
come
she
alone
in
the
world
and
i
believe
the
comfortable
roominess
of
this
house
would
be
very
grateful
to
her
after
the
inconvenience
of
her
stuffy
little
room
over
at
the
back
you
bet
it
would
murmured
bertram
feelingly
but
william
did
not
appear
to
hear
him
she
amiable
fairly
sensible
and
always
a
lady
he
went
on
and
morning
i
believe
i
run
over
and
see
if
she
ca
come
right
and
may
i
ask
which
er
stratum
she
they
will
occupy
smiled
bertram
you
may
ask
but
i
afraid
you
wo
find
out
very
soon
retorted
william
dryly
if
we
take
as
long
to
decide
that
matter
as
we
have
the
rest
of
er
cyril
has
the
most
unoccupied
space
volunteered
bertram
cheerfully
indeed
retaliated
cyril
suppose
you
let
me
speak
for
myself
of
course
so
far
as
truck
is
concerned
i
not
in
it
with
you
and
will
but
as
for
the
use
i
put
my
rooms
to
besides
i
already
have
pete
there
and
would
have
dong
ling
probably
if
he
slept
here
however
if
you
want
any
of
my
rooms
do
let
my
petty
wants
and
wishes
interfere
no
no
interrupted
william
in
quick
conciliation
we
do
want
your
rooms
cyril
aunt
hannah
abhors
stairs
of
course
i
might
move
i
suppose
my
rooms
are
one
flight
less
but
if
i
only
did
have
so
many
things
oh
you
men
shrugged
kate
wearily
why
do
you
ask
my
opinion
sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
a
woman
wit
might
be
of
some
help
all
right
go
ahead
nodded
william
kate
leaned
forward
eagerly
kate
loved
to
go
easy
now
cautioned
bertram
warily
you
know
a
strata
even
one
as
solid
as
ours
wo
stand
too
much
of
an
earthquake
it
is
an
earthquake
at
all
sniffed
kate
it
a
very
sensible
move
all
around
here
are
these
two
great
the
library
and
the
little
across
the
hall
and
not
one
of
them
is
ever
used
but
this
of
course
the
women
would
like
to
sleep
down
here
but
why
do
you
bertram
take
the
back
the
library
and
the
little
for
yours
and
leave
the
whole
of
the
second
floor
for
billy
and
aunt
hannah
good
for
you
kate
cried
bertram
appreciatively
you
hit
it
square
on
the
head
and
we
do
it
i
move
the
light
down
here
is
just
as
good
as
it
is
if
you
let
it
in
thank
you
bertram
and
you
too
kate
breathed
william
fervently
now
if
you
do
mind
i
believe
i
go
to
bed
i
am
tired
chapter
x
aunt
hannah
as
soon
as
possible
after
breakfast
william
went
to
see
aunt
hannah
hannah
stetson
was
not
really
william
aunt
though
she
had
been
called
aunt
hannah
for
years
she
was
the
widow
of
a
distant
cousin
and
she
lived
in
a
snug
little
room
in
a
back
bay
she
was
a
slender
woman
with
kind
blue
eyes
and
a
lovable
smile
her
cheeks
were
still
faintly
pink
and
her
fine
hair
broke
into
little
kinks
and
curls
about
her
ears
according
to
bertram
she
always
made
one
think
of
lavender
and
old
she
welcomed
william
cordially
this
morning
though
with
faint
surprise
in
her
eyes
yes
i
know
i
an
early
caller
and
an
unexpected
one
began
william
hurriedly
and
i
shall
have
to
plunge
straight
into
the
matter
too
for
there
is
time
to
preamble
i
taken
an
girl
to
bring
up
aunt
hannah
and
i
want
you
to
come
down
and
live
with
us
to
chaperon
my
grief
and
conscience
william
gasped
the
little
woman
agitatedly
yes
yes
i
know
aunt
hannah
everything
you
would
say
if
you
could
but
please
skip
the
hysterics
we
all
had
them
and
kate
has
already
used
every
possible
adjective
that
you
could
think
up
now
it
just
and
he
hurriedly
gave
stetson
a
full
account
of
the
case
and
told
her
plainly
what
he
hoped
and
expected
that
she
would
do
for
him
why
yes
of
course
i
come
acquiesced
the
lady
a
little
breathlessly
if
if
you
are
sure
you
going
to
keep
good
and
remember
i
said
please
that
i
wanted
you
to
come
right
away
of
course
kate
ca
stay
just
get
in
half
a
dozen
women
to
help
you
pack
and
half
a
dozen
women
in
that
little
room
william
impossible
well
i
only
meant
to
get
enough
so
you
could
come
right
off
this
but
i
do
need
them
william
there
are
only
my
clothes
and
books
and
such
things
you
know
it
is
a
furnished
all
right
all
right
aunt
hannah
i
wanted
to
make
sure
you
hurried
that
all
you
see
i
do
want
billy
to
suspect
just
how
much
upsetting
us
i
asked
kate
to
take
her
over
to
her
house
for
the
day
while
bertram
is
moving
and
while
we
getting
you
settled
i
i
think
you
like
it
there
aunt
hannah
added
william
anxiously
of
course
billy
got
spunk
but
he
hesitated
and
smiled
a
little
got
what
faltered
the
other
spunk
oh
i
do
mean
that
kind
laughed
william
in
answer
to
the
dismayed
expression
on
his
aunt
face
spunk
is
a
a
cat
but
such
a
name
william
i
i
think
we
change
eh
oh
you
do
murmured
william
with
a
curious
smile
very
well
be
that
as
it
may
anyhow
you
coming
and
we
shall
want
you
all
settled
by
dinner
time
he
finished
as
he
picked
up
his
hat
to
go
with
kate
billy
spent
the
long
day
very
contentedly
in
kate
beautiful
commonwealth
avenue
home
the
two
boys
paul
twelve
years
old
and
egbert
eight
were
a
little
shy
it
is
true
and
not
really
of
much
use
as
companions
but
there
was
a
little
kate
four
years
old
who
proved
to
be
wonderfully
entertaining
billy
was
not
much
used
to
children
and
she
found
this
atom
of
humanity
to
be
a
great
source
of
interest
and
amusement
she
even
told
hartwell
at
parting
that
little
kate
was
almost
as
nice
as
spunk
which
remark
oddly
enough
did
not
appear
to
please
hartwell
to
the
extent
that
billy
thought
that
it
would
at
the
beacon
street
house
billy
was
presented
at
once
to
stetson
and
you
are
to
call
me
hannah
my
dear
said
the
little
woman
graciously
just
as
the
boys
thank
you
dimpled
billy
and
you
do
know
aunt
hannah
how
good
it
seems
to
me
to
come
into
so
many
relatives
all
at
once
upon
going
billy
found
her
room
somewhat
changed
it
was
far
less
warlike
and
the
case
of
spiders
had
been
taken
away
and
this
will
be
your
stratum
you
know
announced
bertram
from
the
stairway
yours
and
aunt
hannah
you
to
have
this
whole
floor
will
and
cyril
are
above
and
i
you
are
why
i
thought
you
were
billy
face
was
puzzled
here
oh
well
i
did
have
some
things
here
he
retorted
airily
but
i
took
them
all
away
you
see
my
stratum
is
and
it
does
do
to
mix
the
layers
by
the
way
you
have
been
yet
have
you
come
on
and
i
show
you
and
you
too
aunt
billy
clapped
her
hands
but
aunt
hannah
shook
her
head
i
leave
that
for
younger
feet
than
mine
she
said
adding
whimsically
it
best
sometimes
that
one
does
try
to
step
too
far
off
one
own
level
you
all
right
laughed
the
man
come
on
miss
on
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
he
tapped
twice
lightly
well
pete
called
cyril
voice
none
too
cordially
pete
indeed
scoffed
bertram
you
got
company
young
man
open
the
door
miss
billy
is
viewing
the
the
bare
floor
echoed
to
a
quick
tread
then
the
door
opened
and
cyril
faced
them
with
a
forced
smile
on
his
lips
come
in
though
i
fear
there
will
be
little
to
see
he
said
bertram
assumed
a
pompous
attitude
ladies
and
gentlemen
you
behold
here
the
lion
in
his
be
still
bertram
ordered
cyril
he
is
a
lion
really
confided
bertram
in
a
lower
voice
but
as
he
prefers
it
we
just
call
him
musical
man
i
should
think
i
was
some
sort
of
that
turned
with
a
crank
bristled
cyril
bertram
grinned
a
crank
did
you
say
well
even
i
would
have
quite
dared
to
say
that
you
know
with
an
impatient
gesture
cyril
turned
on
his
heel
bertram
fell
once
more
into
his
pompous
attitude
before
you
is
the
man
workshop
he
orated
at
your
right
you
see
his
instruments
of
tor
i
mean
his
instruments
a
piano
flute
etc
at
your
left
is
the
desk
with
its
pens
paper
erasers
ink
and
postage
stamps
i
mention
these
because
there
are
er
so
few
things
to
mention
here
beyond
through
the
open
door
one
may
catch
glimpses
of
still
other
rooms
but
they
hold
even
less
than
this
one
holds
tradition
doth
assert
however
that
in
one
is
a
and
in
another
two
billy
listened
silently
her
eyes
were
questioning
she
was
not
quite
sure
how
to
take
bertram
words
and
the
bare
rooms
and
their
master
filled
her
with
a
vague
pity
but
the
pause
that
followed
bertram
nonsense
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
her
to
fill
it
oh
i
should
like
to
hear
you
play
cyril
she
stammered
then
gathering
courage
can
you
play
maiden
prayer
bertram
gave
a
cough
a
spasmodic
cough
that
sent
him
out
into
the
hall
from
there
he
called
ca
stop
for
the
animals
to
perform
miss
billy
it
dinner
time
and
we
got
lots
to
see
all
right
but
sometime
nodded
billy
over
her
shoulder
to
cyril
as
she
turned
away
i
just
love
that
prayer
now
this
is
william
stratum
announced
bertram
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
you
will
perceive
that
there
is
no
knocking
here
doors
are
always
by
all
means
come
in
come
in
called
william
cheery
voice
oh
my
what
a
lot
of
things
exclaimed
billy
my
my
what
a
lot
of
things
how
spunk
will
like
this
room
bertram
chuckled
then
he
made
a
great
display
of
drawing
a
long
breath
in
the
short
time
at
our
disposal
he
began
loftily
it
will
be
impossible
to
point
out
each
particular
article
and
give
its
history
from
the
beginning
but
somewhere
you
will
find
four
round
white
stones
which
er
yes
we
know
all
about
those
white
stones
interrupted
william
and
you
please
let
me
talk
about
my
own
things
myself
and
he
beamed
benevolently
on
the
girl
at
bertram
side
but
there
are
so
many
breathed
billy
all
the
more
chance
then
smiled
william
that
somewhere
among
them
you
find
something
to
interest
you
now
these
chinese
ceramics
and
these
bronzes
maybe
you
like
those
he
suggested
and
with
a
resigned
sigh
and
an
exaggerated
air
of
submission
bertram
stepped
back
and
gave
way
to
his
brother
and
there
are
these
miniatures
and
these
japanese
porcelains
or
perhaps
you
like
stamps
or
theatre
programs
better
william
finished
anxiously
billy
did
not
reply
she
was
turning
round
and
round
her
eyes
wide
and
amazed
suddenly
she
pounced
on
a
beautifully
decorated
teapot
and
held
it
up
in
admiring
hands
oh
what
a
pretty
teapot
and
what
a
cute
little
plate
it
sets
in
she
cried
the
collector
fairly
bubbled
over
with
joy
that
a
lowestoft
a
real
lowestoft
he
crowed
not
that
stuff
from
the
orient
that
called
lowestoft
but
the
real
thing
english
you
know
and
that
the
tray
that
goes
with
it
too
wonderful
how
i
got
them
both
you
know
they
always
get
separated
i
paid
a
cool
hundred
for
them
a
hundred
dollars
for
a
teapot
gasped
billy
yes
and
here
a
nice
little
piece
of
pretty
is
it
and
there
a
fine
bit
of
black
basalt
and
er
will
interposed
bertram
meekly
oh
and
here
a
castleford
cried
william
paying
no
attention
to
the
interruption
marked
too
see
castleford
you
know
there
is
much
of
that
ware
marked
this
is
a
beauty
too
i
think
you
see
this
pitted
surface
they
made
that
with
tiny
little
points
set
into
the
inner
side
of
the
mold
the
design
stands
out
fine
on
this
it
one
of
the
best
i
ever
saw
and
oh
er
william
interposed
bertram
again
a
little
louder
this
time
may
i
just
say
and
did
you
notice
this
blue
hurried
on
william
eagerly
lid
sets
down
in
you
see
that
older
than
the
kind
where
it
sets
over
the
top
now
here
one
william
almost
shouted
bertram
dinner
is
ready
pete
has
sounded
the
gong
twice
already
eh
oh
sure
enough
sure
enough
acknowledged
william
with
a
regretful
glance
at
his
treasures
well
we
must
go
we
must
but
i
have
seen
your
stratum
at
all
demurred
billy
to
her
guide
as
they
went
down
the
stairway
then
there
something
left
for
promised
bertram
but
you
must
remember
i
have
got
any
beautiful
blues
and
basalts
to
say
nothing
of
stamps
and
baggage
tags
but
i
make
you
some
tea
some
real
tea
and
that
more
than
william
has
done
with
all
his
hundred
and
one
teapots
chapter
xi
bertram
has
visitors
spunk
did
not
change
his
name
but
that
was
perhaps
the
only
thing
that
did
not
meet
with
some
sort
of
change
during
the
weeks
that
immediately
followed
billy
arrival
given
a
house
five
men
and
an
ironbound
routine
of
life
and
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
the
advent
of
a
somewhat
fussy
elderly
woman
an
impulsive
young
girl
and
a
small
cat
will
make
some
difference
as
to
name
it
was
not
stetson
fault
that
even
that
was
left
undisturbed
stetson
early
became
acquainted
with
spunk
she
was
introduced
to
him
indeed
on
the
night
of
her
arrival
though
fortunately
not
at
table
william
had
seen
to
it
that
spunk
did
not
appear
at
dinner
though
to
accomplish
this
the
man
had
been
obliged
to
face
the
amazed
and
grieved
indignation
of
the
kitten
mistress
but
i
do
see
how
any
one
can
object
to
a
nice
clean
little
cat
at
the
table
billy
had
remonstrated
tearfully
i
know
but
er
they
do
sometimes
william
had
stammered
and
this
is
one
of
the
times
aunt
hannah
would
never
stand
for
it
never
oh
but
she
does
know
spunk
billy
had
observed
then
hopefully
you
just
wait
until
she
knows
stetson
began
to
know
spunk
the
next
day
the
immediate
source
of
her
knowledge
was
the
discovery
that
spunk
had
found
her
ball
of
black
knitting
yarn
and
had
delightedly
captured
it
not
that
he
was
content
to
let
it
remain
where
it
was
indeed
no
he
rolled
it
down
the
stairs
batted
it
through
the
hall
to
the
and
then
proceeded
to
with
it
in
and
out
among
the
legs
of
various
chairs
and
tables
ending
in
one
grand
whirl
that
wound
the
yarn
round
and
round
his
small
body
and
keeled
him
over
half
upon
his
back
there
he
blissfully
went
to
sleep
billy
found
him
after
a
gleeful
following
of
the
slender
woollen
trail
stetson
was
with
her
but
she
was
not
gleeful
oh
aunt
hannah
aunt
hannah
gurgled
billy
is
he
just
too
cute
for
anything
aunt
hannah
shook
her
head
i
must
confess
i
do
see
it
she
declared
my
dear
just
look
at
that
hopeless
snarl
oh
but
it
is
hopeless
at
all
laughed
billy
it
like
one
of
those
strings
they
unwind
at
parties
with
a
present
at
the
end
of
it
and
spunk
is
the
present
she
added
when
she
had
extricated
the
small
gray
cat
and
you
shall
hold
him
she
finished
graciously
entrusting
the
sleepy
kitten
to
stetson
unwilling
arms
but
i
it
i
ca
billy
i
do
like
that
name
blurted
out
the
indignant
little
lady
with
as
much
warmth
as
she
ever
allowed
herself
to
show
it
must
be
changed
to
to
changed
spunk
name
changed
demanded
billy
in
a
horrified
voice
why
aunt
hannah
it
ca
be
changed
it
his
you
then
she
laughed
merrily
indeed
why
you
old
dear
just
suppose
i
should
ask
you
to
change
your
name
now
like
clarabella
lots
better
than
but
i
not
going
to
ask
you
to
change
that
and
i
going
to
love
you
just
as
well
even
if
you
are
see
if
i
do
and
you
love
spunk
too
i
sure
you
will
now
watch
me
find
the
end
of
this
snarl
and
she
danced
over
to
the
dumbfounded
little
lady
in
the
big
chair
gave
her
an
affectionate
kiss
and
then
attacked
the
tangled
mass
of
black
with
skilful
fingers
but
i
you
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
finished
the
little
woman
whose
name
was
not
helen
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
according
to
bertram
was
aunt
hannah
deadliest
in
aunt
hannah
black
silk
lap
spunk
stretched
luxuriously
and
blinked
sleepy
eyes
then
with
a
long
purr
of
content
he
curled
himself
for
another
nap
still
spunk
it
was
some
time
after
luncheon
that
day
that
bertram
heard
a
knock
at
his
studio
door
bertram
was
busy
his
particular
pet
face
of
a
girl
was
to
be
submitted
soon
to
the
judges
of
a
forthcoming
art
exhibition
and
it
was
not
yet
finished
he
was
trying
to
make
up
now
for
the
many
hours
lost
during
the
last
few
days
and
even
bertram
at
times
did
not
like
interruptions
his
model
had
gone
but
he
was
still
working
rapidly
when
the
knock
came
his
tone
was
not
quite
cordial
when
he
answered
well
it
i
spunk
and
i
may
we
come
in
called
a
confident
voice
bertram
said
a
sharp
word
behind
his
teeth
but
he
opened
the
door
of
course
i
was
painting
he
announced
how
lovely
and
i
watch
you
oh
my
what
a
pretty
room
i
glad
you
like
indeed
i
do
i
like
it
ever
so
much
i
shall
stay
here
lots
i
oh
you
will
for
once
even
bertram
ready
tongue
failed
to
find
fitting
response
yes
now
paint
i
want
to
see
you
aunt
hannah
has
gone
out
anyway
and
i
lonesome
i
think
i
but
i
ca
that
is
i
not
used
to
of
course
you
are
you
poor
old
lonesomeness
but
it
is
going
to
be
that
way
any
more
you
know
now
that
i
come
i
let
you
be
i
could
swear
to
that
declared
the
man
with
sudden
fervor
and
for
billy
peace
of
mind
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
that
she
did
not
know
the
exact
source
of
that
fervency
now
paint
commanded
billy
again
because
he
did
not
know
what
else
to
do
bertram
picked
up
a
brush
but
he
did
not
paint
the
first
stroke
of
his
brush
against
the
canvas
was
to
spunk
a
challenge
and
spunk
never
refused
a
challenge
with
a
bound
he
was
on
bertram
knee
gleeful
paw
outstretched
batting
at
the
end
of
the
brush
tut
tut
no
no
naughty
spunk
say
but
was
that
cute
chuckled
billy
do
it
again
the
artist
gave
an
exasperated
sigh
my
dear
girl
he
protested
cruel
as
it
may
seem
to
you
this
picture
is
not
a
kindergarten
game
for
the
edification
of
small
cats
i
must
politely
ask
spunk
to
but
he
wo
laughed
billy
never
mind
we
will
take
it
some
day
when
he
asleep
let
not
paint
any
more
anyhow
i
come
to
see
your
and
she
sprang
blithely
to
her
feet
dear
dear
what
a
lot
of
faces
and
all
girls
too
how
funny
why
do
you
paint
other
things
still
they
are
rather
thank
you
accepted
bertram
dryly
bertram
did
not
paint
any
more
that
afternoon
billy
found
much
to
interest
her
and
she
asked
numberless
questions
she
was
greatly
excited
when
she
understood
the
full
significance
of
the
omnipresent
face
of
a
girl
and
she
graciously
offered
to
pose
herself
for
the
artist
she
spent
indeed
quite
half
an
hour
turning
her
head
from
side
to
side
and
demanding
now
how
that
and
that
tiring
at
last
of
this
she
suggested
spunk
as
a
substitute
remarking
that
after
all
cats
pretty
cats
like
spunk
were
even
nicer
to
paint
than
girls
she
rescued
spunk
then
from
the
where
he
had
been
holding
high
carnival
with
bertram
tubes
of
paint
and
demanded
if
bertram
ever
saw
a
more
delightful
more
entrancing
more
model
she
was
so
artless
so
merry
so
frankly
charmed
with
it
all
that
bertram
could
not
find
it
in
his
heart
to
be
angry
notwithstanding
his
annoyance
but
when
at
four
she
took
herself
and
her
cat
cheerily
he
lifted
his
hands
in
despair
great
scott
he
groaned
if
this
is
a
sample
of
what
coming
going
that
all
chapter
xii
cyril
takes
his
turn
billy
had
been
a
member
of
the
beacon
street
household
a
week
before
she
repeated
her
visit
to
cyril
at
the
top
of
the
house
this
time
bertram
was
not
with
her
she
went
alone
even
spunk
was
left
behind
billy
remembered
her
prospective
host
aversion
to
cats
billy
did
not
feel
that
she
knew
cyril
very
well
she
had
tried
several
times
to
chat
with
him
but
she
had
made
so
little
headway
that
she
finally
came
to
the
conclusion
privately
expressed
to
bertram
that
cyril
was
bashful
bertram
had
only
laughed
he
had
laughed
the
harder
because
at
that
moment
he
could
hear
cyril
pounding
out
his
angry
annoyance
on
the
piano
upstairs
cyril
had
just
escaped
from
one
of
billy
most
determined
attempts
and
bertram
knew
it
bertram
laugh
had
puzzled
billy
and
it
had
not
quite
pleased
her
hence
she
did
not
tell
him
of
her
plan
to
go
and
see
what
she
could
do
herself
alone
to
combat
this
foolish
bashfulness
on
the
part
of
cyril
henshaw
in
spite
of
her
bravery
billy
waited
quite
one
whole
minute
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
before
she
had
the
courage
to
knock
at
cyril
door
the
door
was
opened
at
once
why
billy
cried
the
man
in
surprise
yes
it
billy
i
i
came
up
to
to
get
acquainted
she
smiled
winningly
why
er
you
are
very
kind
will
you
come
in
thank
you
yes
you
see
i
did
bring
spunk
i
cyril
bowed
gravely
you
are
very
kind
again
he
said
billy
fidgeted
in
her
chair
to
her
mind
she
was
not
getting
on
at
all
she
determined
on
a
bold
stroke
you
see
i
thought
if
if
i
should
come
up
here
where
there
be
so
many
around
we
might
get
acquainted
she
confided
then
i
would
get
to
like
you
just
as
well
as
i
do
the
at
the
odd
look
that
came
into
the
man
face
the
girl
realized
suddenly
what
she
had
said
her
cheeks
flushed
a
confused
red
oh
dear
that
is
i
mean
i
like
you
of
course
she
floundered
miserably
then
she
broke
off
with
a
frank
laugh
there
you
see
i
never
could
get
out
of
anything
i
might
as
well
own
right
up
i
like
you
as
well
as
i
do
uncle
william
and
bertram
so
there
cyril
laughed
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
seen
billy
something
that
was
very
like
interest
came
into
his
eyes
oh
you
do
he
retorted
now
that
is
er
very
unkind
of
billy
shook
her
head
you
do
say
that
as
if
you
meant
it
she
accused
him
her
eyes
gravely
studying
his
face
now
i
in
earnest
really
want
to
like
you
thank
you
then
perhaps
you
wo
mind
telling
me
why
you
do
like
me
he
suggested
again
billy
flushed
why
i
i
just
do
that
all
she
faltered
then
she
cried
aggrievedly
there
now
you
made
me
be
impolite
and
i
did
mean
to
be
of
course
not
assented
the
man
and
it
was
impolite
because
i
asked
you
for
the
information
you
know
i
may
conclude
then
he
went
on
with
an
odd
twinkle
in
his
eyes
that
i
am
merely
classed
with
tripe
and
rainy
with
tripe
and
rainy
days
those
are
the
only
things
if
i
remember
rightly
that
you
do
the
girl
stared
then
she
chuckled
there
i
knew
i
like
you
better
if
you
only
say
something
she
beamed
but
let
not
talk
any
more
about
that
play
to
me
wo
you
you
know
you
promised
me
maiden
prayer
cyril
stiffened
pardon
me
but
you
must
be
mistaken
he
replied
coldly
i
do
not
play
maiden
prayer
oh
what
a
shame
and
i
do
so
love
it
but
you
play
other
things
i
heard
you
a
little
and
bertram
says
you
do
in
concerts
and
does
he
murmured
cyril
with
a
slight
lifting
of
his
eyebrows
there
now
off
you
go
again
all
silent
and
horrid
chaffed
billy
what
have
i
said
now
cyril
do
you
know
what
i
think
i
believe
you
got
nerves
billy
voice
was
so
tragic
that
the
man
could
but
laugh
perhaps
i
have
miss
like
miss
letty
i
not
acquainted
with
the
gee
would
you
two
make
a
pair
chuckled
billy
unexpectedly
no
but
really
i
mean
do
you
want
people
to
walk
on
tiptoe
and
speak
in
whispers
sometimes
the
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
but
she
sighed
then
i
going
this
might
be
one
of
the
times
you
she
hesitated
then
walked
to
the
piano
my
would
i
like
to
play
on
that
she
breathed
cyril
shuddered
cyril
could
imagine
what
billy
would
play
and
cyril
did
not
like
nor
the
oh
do
you
play
he
asked
constrainedly
billy
shook
her
head
not
much
only
little
bits
of
things
you
know
she
said
wistfully
as
she
turned
toward
the
door
for
some
minutes
after
she
had
gone
cyril
stood
where
she
had
left
him
his
eyes
moody
and
troubled
i
suppose
i
might
have
played
something
he
muttered
at
last
but
maiden
prayer
good
heavens
billy
was
a
little
shy
with
cyril
when
he
came
down
to
dinner
that
night
for
the
next
few
days
indeed
she
held
herself
very
obviously
aloof
from
him
cyril
caught
himself
wondering
once
if
she
were
afraid
of
his
he
did
not
try
to
find
out
however
he
was
too
emphatically
content
that
of
her
own
accord
she
seemed
to
be
leaving
him
in
peace
it
must
have
been
a
week
after
billy
visit
to
the
top
of
the
house
that
cyril
stopped
his
playing
very
abruptly
one
day
and
opened
his
door
to
go
at
the
first
step
he
started
back
in
amazement
why
billy
he
ejaculated
the
girl
was
sitting
very
near
the
top
of
the
stairway
at
his
appearance
she
got
to
her
feet
shamefacedly
why
billy
what
in
the
world
are
you
doing
there
listening
yes
do
you
mind
the
man
did
not
answer
he
was
too
surprised
to
find
words
at
once
and
he
was
trying
to
recollect
what
he
had
been
playing
you
see
listening
to
music
this
way
is
like
listening
to
to
talking
hurried
on
billy
feverishly
it
is
sneaking
like
that
is
it
why
and
you
do
mind
why
surely
i
ought
not
to
mind
that
he
admitted
then
i
can
keep
right
on
as
i
have
done
thank
you
sighed
billy
in
relief
keep
right
on
have
you
been
here
before
why
yes
lots
of
days
and
say
cyril
what
is
that
that
thing
that
all
chords
with
big
bass
notes
that
keep
saying
something
so
fine
and
splendid
that
it
marches
on
and
on
getting
bigger
and
grander
just
as
if
there
could
anything
stop
it
until
it
all
ends
in
one
great
burst
of
triumph
cyril
what
is
that
why
billy
the
interest
this
time
in
the
man
face
was
not
faint
i
wish
i
might
make
others
catch
my
meaning
as
i
have
evidently
made
you
do
it
that
something
of
my
own
that
i
writing
you
understand
and
i
tried
to
say
just
what
you
say
you
and
i
did
hear
it
i
did
oh
wo
you
play
it
please
with
the
door
open
i
ca
billy
i
sorry
indeed
i
am
but
i
an
appointment
and
i
late
now
you
shall
hear
it
though
i
promise
you
and
with
the
door
wide
open
continued
the
man
as
with
a
murmured
apology
he
passed
the
girl
and
hurried
down
the
stairs
billy
waited
until
she
heard
the
outer
hall
door
shut
then
very
softly
she
crept
through
cyril
open
doorway
and
crossed
the
room
to
the
piano
chapter
xiii
a
surprise
all
around
may
came
and
with
it
warm
sunny
days
there
was
a
little
balcony
at
the
rear
of
the
second
floor
and
on
this
stetson
and
billy
sat
many
a
morning
and
sewed
there
were
occupations
that
billy
liked
better
than
sewing
but
she
was
dutiful
and
she
was
really
fond
of
aunt
hannah
so
she
accepted
as
gracefully
as
possible
that
good
lady
dictum
that
a
woman
who
could
not
sew
and
sew
well
was
no
lady
at
all
one
of
the
things
that
billy
liked
to
do
so
much
better
than
to
sew
was
to
play
on
cyril
piano
she
was
very
careful
however
that
cyril
himself
did
not
find
this
out
cyril
was
frequently
gone
from
the
house
and
almost
as
frequently
aunt
hannah
took
naps
at
such
times
it
was
very
easy
to
slip
to
cyril
rooms
and
once
at
the
piano
billy
forgot
everything
else
one
day
however
the
inevitable
happened
cyril
came
home
unexpectedly
the
man
heard
the
piano
from
william
floor
and
with
a
surprised
ejaculation
he
hurried
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
at
the
door
he
stopped
in
amazement
billy
was
at
the
piano
but
she
was
not
playing
the
storm
nor
yet
the
maiden
there
was
no
music
before
her
but
under
her
fingers
big
bass
notes
very
much
like
cyril
own
were
marching
on
and
on
to
victory
billy
face
was
rapturously
intent
and
happy
by
jove
billy
gasped
the
man
billy
leaped
to
her
feet
and
whirled
around
guiltily
oh
cyril
i
so
sorry
sorry
and
you
play
like
that
no
no
i
not
sorry
i
played
it
because
you
found
billy
cheeks
were
a
shamed
red
but
her
eyes
were
defiantly
brilliant
and
her
chin
was
at
a
rebellious
tilt
i
was
doing
any
harm
not
if
you
were
here
with
your
nerves
the
man
laughed
and
came
slowly
into
the
room
billy
who
taught
you
to
play
no
one
i
ca
play
i
can
only
pick
out
little
bits
of
things
in
but
you
do
play
i
just
heard
billy
shrugged
her
shoulders
that
was
nothing
it
was
only
what
i
had
heard
i
was
trying
to
make
it
sound
like
and
by
george
you
succeeded
muttered
cyril
under
his
breath
then
aloud
he
asked
did
you
ever
study
music
billy
eyes
dimmed
no
that
was
the
only
thing
aunt
ella
and
i
did
think
alike
about
she
had
an
old
square
piano
all
and
thin
you
know
i
played
some
on
it
and
wanted
to
take
lessons
but
i
did
want
to
practise
on
that
i
wanted
a
new
one
that
what
she
would
do
get
me
a
new
piano
or
let
me
do
it
she
said
she
practised
on
that
piano
and
that
it
was
quite
good
enough
for
me
especially
to
learn
on
i
i
afraid
i
got
stuffy
i
hated
that
piano
so
but
i
was
almost
ready
to
give
in
when
when
aunt
ella
and
all
you
play
then
is
just
by
ear
by
ear
i
suppose
so
if
you
mean
what
i
hear
easy
things
i
can
play
quick
but
but
those
chords
are
hard
they
skip
around
so
cyril
smiled
oddly
i
should
say
so
he
agreed
but
perhaps
there
is
something
else
that
i
play
that
you
like
is
there
oh
yes
now
there
that
little
thing
that
swings
and
sways
like
this
cried
billy
dropping
herself
on
to
the
piano
stool
and
whisking
about
billy
was
not
afraid
now
nor
defiant
she
was
only
eager
and
happy
again
in
a
moment
a
dreamy
waltz
fell
upon
cyril
ears
a
waltz
that
he
often
played
himself
it
was
not
played
correctly
it
is
true
there
were
notes
and
sometimes
whole
measures
that
were
very
different
from
the
printed
music
but
the
tune
the
rhythm
and
the
spirit
were
there
and
there
this
said
billy
and
this
she
went
on
sliding
into
one
little
strain
after
another
all
of
which
were
recognized
by
the
amazed
man
at
her
side
billy
he
cried
when
she
had
finished
and
whirled
upon
him
again
billy
would
you
like
to
learn
to
play
really
play
from
notes
oh
would
i
then
you
shall
we
have
a
piano
tomorrow
in
your
rooms
for
you
to
practise
on
and
i
teach
you
oh
thank
you
cyril
you
do
know
how
i
thank
you
exulted
billy
as
she
danced
from
the
room
to
tell
aunt
hannah
of
this
great
and
good
thing
that
had
come
into
her
life
to
billy
this
promise
of
cyril
to
be
her
teacher
was
very
kind
very
delightful
but
it
was
not
in
the
least
a
thing
at
which
to
marvel
to
bertram
however
it
most
certainly
was
well
guess
what
happened
he
said
to
william
that
night
after
he
had
heard
the
news
i
believe
anything
now
anything
that
raffle
off
your
collection
of
teapots
at
the
next
church
fair
or
that
i
shall
go
to
egypt
as
a
guide
listen
cyril
is
going
to
give
piano
lessons
to
billy
cyril
chapter
xiv
aunt
hannah
speaks
her
mind
bertram
said
that
the
strata
was
not
a
strata
any
longer
he
declared
that
between
them
billy
and
spunk
had
caused
such
an
upheaval
that
there
was
no
telling
where
one
stratum
left
off
and
another
began
what
billy
had
not
attended
to
spunk
had
he
said
you
see
it
like
this
he
explained
to
an
amused
friend
one
day
billy
is
taking
piano
lessons
of
cyril
and
she
is
posing
for
one
of
my
heads
naturally
then
such
feminine
belongings
as
thread
thimbles
and
hairpins
are
due
to
show
up
at
any
time
either
in
apartments
or
mine
to
say
nothing
of
william
and
she
in
lots
to
look
for
spunk
if
for
no
other
purpose
you
must
know
that
spunk
likes
william
floor
the
best
of
the
bunch
there
are
so
many
delightful
things
to
play
with
not
that
spunk
stays
there
dear
me
no
he
a
sociable
little
chap
and
his
usual
course
is
to
pounce
on
a
shelf
knock
off
some
object
that
tickles
his
fancy
then
lug
it
in
his
mouth
to
well
anywhere
that
he
happens
to
feel
like
going
cyril
has
found
him
with
a
small
miniature
battered
and
chewed
almost
beyond
recognition
and
aunt
hannah
nearly
had
a
fit
one
day
when
he
appeared
in
her
room
with
an
enormous
black
bug
dead
of
course
that
he
had
fished
from
a
case
that
pete
had
left
open
as
for
me
i
can
swear
that
the
little
round
white
stone
he
was
playing
with
in
my
part
of
the
house
was
one
of
william
collection
number
one
and
that
is
all
bertram
continued
billy
brings
her
music
down
to
show
to
me
and
lugs
my
heads
all
over
the
rest
of
the
house
to
show
to
other
folks
and
there
is
always
everywhere
a
knit
shawl
for
aunt
hannah
is
sure
to
feel
a
draught
and
billy
keeps
shawls
handy
so
there
you
are
we
certainly
are
a
strata
any
longer
he
finished
billy
was
indeed
very
much
at
home
in
the
beacon
street
house
too
much
so
aunt
hannah
thought
aunt
hannah
was
in
fact
seriously
disturbed
to
william
one
evening
late
in
may
she
spoke
her
mind
william
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
billy
she
asked
abruptly
do
with
her
what
do
you
mean
returned
william
with
the
contented
smile
that
was
so
often
on
his
lips
these
days
this
is
billy
that
the
worst
of
it
sighed
the
woman
with
a
shake
of
her
head
the
worst
of
it
aunt
hannah
what
do
you
mean
do
you
like
billy
yes
yes
william
of
course
i
like
billy
i
love
her
who
could
help
it
that
not
what
i
mean
it
of
billy
i
thinking
and
of
the
rest
of
you
she
ca
stay
here
like
this
she
must
go
away
to
school
or
or
and
she
going
in
september
replied
the
man
she
go
to
preparatory
school
first
and
to
college
yes
but
now
right
away
she
ought
to
go
why
yes
for
the
summer
of
course
but
those
plans
are
completed
yet
billy
and
i
were
talking
of
it
last
evening
you
know
the
boys
are
always
away
more
or
less
but
i
seldom
go
until
august
and
we
let
pete
and
dong
ling
off
then
for
a
month
and
close
the
house
i
told
billy
send
you
and
her
anywhere
she
liked
for
the
whole
summer
but
she
says
no
she
prefers
to
stay
here
with
me
but
i
do
quite
fancy
that
idea
through
all
the
hot
june
and
july
so
i
do
know
but
i
get
a
cottage
somewhere
near
at
one
of
the
beaches
where
i
can
run
back
and
forth
night
and
morning
of
course
in
that
case
we
take
pete
and
dong
ling
with
us
and
close
the
house
right
away
i
fear
cyril
would
not
fancy
it
much
but
after
all
he
and
bertram
would
be
off
more
or
less
they
always
are
in
the
but
william
you
have
yet
got
my
idea
at
all
demurred
aunt
hannah
with
a
discouraged
shake
of
her
head
it
away
away
from
all
this
from
you
that
i
want
to
get
away
away
from
me
cried
the
man
with
an
odd
intonation
of
terror
as
he
started
forward
in
his
chair
why
aunt
hannah
what
are
you
talking
about
about
billy
this
is
no
place
in
which
to
bring
up
a
young
girl
a
young
girl
who
has
not
one
shred
of
relationship
to
excuse
but
she
is
my
namesake
and
quite
alone
in
the
world
aunt
hannah
quite
alone
poor
child
my
dear
william
that
is
exactly
it
she
is
a
child
and
yet
she
is
not
that
where
the
trouble
what
do
you
mean
william
billy
has
been
brought
up
in
a
little
country
town
with
a
spinster
aunt
and
a
whole
tolerant
village
for
company
well
she
has
accepted
you
and
your
entire
household
even
down
to
dong
ling
on
the
same
well
i
sure
i
glad
asserted
the
man
with
genial
warmth
good
for
us
to
have
her
here
it
good
for
the
boys
she
already
livened
cyril
up
and
toned
bertram
down
i
may
as
well
confess
aunt
hannah
that
i
been
more
than
a
little
disturbed
about
bertram
of
late
i
do
like
that
bob
seaver
that
he
is
so
fond
of
and
some
other
fellows
too
that
have
been
coming
here
altogether
too
much
during
the
last
year
bertram
says
they
only
a
little
in
their
tastes
and
to
me
that
the
worst
of
it
for
bertram
himself
is
quite
too
much
inclined
that
exactly
william
and
that
only
goes
to
prove
what
i
said
before
bertram
is
not
a
spinster
aunt
and
neither
are
any
of
the
rest
of
you
but
billy
takes
you
that
takes
us
that
way
as
spinster
aunts
yes
she
makes
herself
as
free
in
this
house
as
she
was
in
her
aunt
ella
at
hampden
falls
she
flies
up
to
cyril
rooms
half
a
dozen
times
a
day
with
some
question
about
her
lessons
and
i
do
know
how
long
she
sit
at
his
feet
and
adoringly
listen
to
his
playing
if
he
did
sometimes
get
out
of
patience
and
tell
her
to
go
and
practise
herself
she
makes
nothing
of
tripping
into
bertram
studio
at
all
hours
of
the
day
and
he
sketched
her
head
at
every
conceivable
angle
which
certainly
does
tend
to
make
billy
modest
or
retiring
as
to
you
you
know
how
much
she
in
your
rooms
spending
evening
after
evening
fussing
over
your
i
know
but
we
we
sorting
them
and
making
a
catalogue
defended
the
man
anxiously
besides
i
i
like
to
have
her
there
she
bother
me
a
no
i
know
she
does
replied
aunt
hannah
with
a
curious
inflection
but
do
you
see
william
that
all
this
is
going
to
quite
do
billy
too
young
and
too
come
come
aunt
hannah
is
that
exactly
logical
it
true
at
but
after
all
where
the
harm
do
you
think
that
you
are
just
a
little
bit
too
fastidious
billy
nothing
but
a
it
the
part
that
i
object
to
william
she
has
taken
every
one
of
you
into
intimate
companionship
even
pete
and
dong
pete
and
dong
ling
stetson
chin
came
up
and
her
nostrils
dilated
a
little
billy
went
to
pete
the
other
day
to
have
him
button
her
up
in
the
back
and
yesterday
i
found
her
in
the
kitchen
instructing
dong
ling
how
to
make
chocolate
fudge
william
fell
back
in
his
chair
well
well
he
muttered
well
well
she
is
a
child
and
no
mistake
he
paused
his
brows
drawn
into
a
troubled
frown
but
aunt
hannah
what
can
i
do
of
course
you
could
talk
to
her
but
i
do
seem
to
quite
like
that
my
grief
and
conscience
no
no
that
is
what
is
needed
at
all
it
would
only
serve
to
make
her
and
that
her
one
salvation
now
that
she
is
you
see
it
only
the
fault
of
her
environment
and
training
after
all
it
is
her
heart
that
indeed
it
is
it
will
be
different
when
she
is
older
when
she
has
seen
a
little
more
of
the
world
outside
hampden
falls
she
go
to
school
of
course
and
i
think
she
ought
to
travel
a
little
meanwhile
she
must
live
just
like
this
though
certainly
not
for
a
time
at
no
no
i
afraid
not
agreed
william
perplexedly
rising
to
his
feet
but
we
must
think
what
can
be
his
step
was
even
slower
than
usual
as
he
left
the
room
and
his
eyes
were
troubled
chapter
xv
what
bertram
calls
the
limit
at
half
past
ten
on
the
evening
following
stetson
very
plain
talk
with
william
the
telephone
bell
at
the
beacon
street
house
rang
sharply
pete
answered
it
well
pete
never
said
hello
is
that
you
pete
called
billy
voice
agitatedly
is
uncle
william
there
no
miss
oh

well

then

out
too
miss
billy
and
bertram
they
all

almost
sobbed
billy
dear
dear
what
shall
i
do
pete
you
have
to
come
there
is
any
other
way
yes
miss
where
pete
voice
was
dubious
but
respectful
to
the
boylston
street
subway
on
the
common
you
know
side
i
wait
for
you
but
hurry
you
see
i
all
alone
alone
miss
billy
in
the
subway
at
this
time
of
night
but
miss
billy

must
stuttered
the
old
man
in
helpless
horror
yes
yes
pete
but
never
mind
i
am
here
and
i
should
think
if
was
such
a
dreadful
thing
you
would
hurry
fast
to
get
here
so
i
would
be
alone
appealed
billy
with
an
inarticulate
cry
pete
jerked
the
receiver
on
to
the
hook
and
stumbled
away
from
the
telephone
five
minutes
later
he
had
left
the
house
and
was
hurrying
through
the
common
to
the
boylston
street
subway
station
billy
a
long
cloak
thrown
over
her
white
dress
was
waiting
for
him
her
white
slippers
tapped
the
platform
nervously
and
her
hair
under
the
light
scarf
of
lace
fluffed
into
little
broken
curls
as
if
it
had
been
blown
by
the
wind
miss
billy
miss
billy
what
can
this
mean
gasped
the
man
where
is
stetson
at
hartwell
you
know
she
is
giving
a
reception
but
come
we
must
hurry
i
after
after
bertram
yes
alone
like
this
but
i
not
alone
now
i
have
you
do
you
see
at
the
blank
stupefaction
in
the
man
face
the
girl
sighed
impatiently
dear
me
i
suppose
i
have
to
explain
but
we
losing
time
and
we
must
we
must
she
cried
feverishly
listen
then
quick
it
was
at
hartwell
tonight
i
been
watching
bertram
he
was
with
that
horrid
seaver
and
i
never
liked
him
never
i
overheard
something
they
said
about
some
place
they
were
going
to
and
i
like
what
seaver
said
i
tried
to
speak
to
bertram
but
i
get
a
chance
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
he
gone
with
that
seaver
man
i
saw
them
just
in
time
to
snatch
my
cloak
and
follow
follow
them
miss
billy
i
had
to
pete
do
you
see
there
was
no
one
else
cyril
and
uncle
william
had
gone
home
i
supposed

sent
back
word
by
the
maid
to
aunt
hannah
that
i
gone
ahead
you
know
the
carriage
was
ordered
for
eleven
but
i
afraid
she
wo
have
sense
to
tell
aunt
hannah
she
looked
so
dazed
and
frightened
when
i
told
her
but
i
could
wait
to
say
more
well
i
hurried
out
and
caught
up
with
bertram
just
as
they
were
crossing
arlington
street
to
the
garden
i
heard
them
say
they
were
going
to
walk
so
i
knew
i
could
do
it
but
pete
after
i
got
there
i
did
dare
to
speak
i
did
dare
to
so
i
just
followed
they
went
straight
through
the
garden
and
across
the
common
to
tremont
street
and
on
and
on
until
they
stopped
and
went
down
some
stairs
all
marble
and
lights
and
mirrors
was
a
restaurant
i
think
i
saw
just
where
it
was
then
i
flew
back
here
to
telephone
for
uncle
william
i
knew
he
could
do
something
but
well

rest

man

what

can
get
him
to
come
home
with
me
of
the
old
man
made
a
despairing
gesture
and
looked
about
him
as
if
for
help
he
saw
then
the
curious
questioning
eyes
on
all
sides
and
with
a
quick
change
of
manner
he
touched
miss
billy
arm
yes
we
go
come
he
apparently
agreed
but
once
outside
on
the
broad
expanse
before
the
subway
entrance
he
stopped
again
miss
billy
please
come
home
he
implored
ye
do

the
girl
tossed

head

the

agitatedly

of
times
later
than

at

and
as
for
the
place

and
bright
and

of
people

in

and
gentlemen

billy
voice
broke
and
her
face
flushed
scarlet
she
was
almost
crying
come
you
wo
refuse
now
she
finished
resolutely
turning
toward
the
street
and
because
old
pete
could
not
pick
her
up
bodily
and
carry
her
home
he
followed
close
at
her
heels
at
the
head
of
the
marble
stairs
all
lights
and
mirrors
however
he
made
one
last
plea
miss
billy
once
more
i
beg
of

home

do

what
yer
miss

we
just
stand
at
the
door
and
look
in
until
we
see
him
then
i
go
straight
to
him
and
speak
to
and
with
that
she
turned
and
ran
down
the
steps
billy
blinked
a
little
at
the
lights
which
reflected
in
the
great
mirrors
were
a
million
dazzling
points
that
found
themselves
again
repeated
in
the
sparkling
crystal
and
glittering
silver
on
the
tables
all
about
her
billy
saw
men
and
women
laughing
chatting
and
clinking
together
their
wine
glasses
but
nowhere
as
she
looked
about
her
could
billy
descry
the
man
she
sought
the
head
waiter
came
forward
with
uplifted
hand
but
billy
did
not
see
him
a
girl
at
her
left
laughed
disagreeably
and
several
men
stared
with
boldly
admiring
eyes
but
to
them
too
billy
paid
no
heed
then
halfway
across
the
room
she
spied
bertram
and
seaver
sitting
together
at
a
small
table
alone
simultaneously
her
own
and
bertram
eyes
met
with
a
sharp
word
under
his
breath
bertram
sprang
to
his
feet
his
befogged
brain
had
cleared
suddenly
under
the
shock
of
billy
presence
billy
for
heaven
sake
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
in
a
low
voice
as
he
reached
her
side
i
came
for
you
i
want
you
to
go
home
with
me
please
bertram
whispered
billy
pleadingly
the
man
had
not
waited
for
an
answer
to
his
question
with
a
deft
touch
he
had
turned
billy
toward
the
door
and
even
as
she
finished
her
sentence
she
found
herself
in
the
marble
hallway
confronting
pete
and
shaking
and
you
too
pete
great
scott
what
does
this
mean
he
exploded
angrily
pete
could
only
shake
his
head
and
glance
imploringly
at
billy
his
dry
lips
and
tongue
refused
to
articulate
even
one
word
we
came
for
you
choked
billy
you
see
i
do
like
that
seaver
well
by
jove
this
is
the
limit

chapter
xvi
kate
takes
a
hand
undeniably
billy
was
in
disgrace
and
none
knew
it
better
than
billy
herself
the
whole
family
had
contributed
to
this
knowledge
aunt
hannah
was
inexpressibly
shocked
she
had
not
breath
even
to
ejaculate
my
grief
and
conscience
kate
was
disgusted
cyril
was
coldly
reserved
bertram
was
frankly
angry
even
william
was
vexed
and
showed
it
spunk
too
as
if
in
league
with
the
rest
took
this
opportunity
to
display
one
of
his
occasional
fits
of
independence
and
when
billy
longing
for
some
sort
of
comfort
called
him
to
her
he
settled
back
on
his
tiny
haunches
and
imperturbably
winked
and
blinked
his
indifference
nearly
all
the
family
had
had
something
to
say
to
billy
on
the
matter
with
not
entirely
satisfactory
results
when
kate
determined
to
see
what
she
could
do
she
chose
a
time
when
she
could
have
the
girl
quite
to
herself
with
small
likelihood
of
interruption
but
billy
how
could
you
do
such
an
absurd
thing
she
demanded
the
idea
of
leaving
my
house
alone
at
ten
at
night
to
follow
a
couple
of
men
through
the
streets
of
boston
and
then
with
my
butler
make
a
scene
like
that
in
a
a
public
billy
sighed
in
a
discouraged
way
aunt
kate
ca
i
make
you
and
the
rest
of
them
understand
that
i
did
start
out
to
do
all
that
i
meant
just
to
speak
to
bertram
and
get
him
away
from
that
but
my
dear
child
even
that
was
bad
enough
billy
lifted
her
chin
you
do
seem
to
think
aunt
kate
bertram
was
was
not
all
the
more
reason
then
why
you
should
not
have
done
what
you
did
why
aunt
kate
you
would
leave
him
alone
in
that
condition
with
that
man
it
was
hartwell
turn
to
sigh
but
billy
she
contested
wearily
ca
you
understand
that
it
was
your
place
to
interfere
you
a
young
girl
i
sure
i
do
see
what
difference
that
makes
i
was
the
only
one
that
could
do
it
besides
afterward
i
did
try
to
get
some
one
else
uncle
william
and
cyril
but
when
i
found
i
could
get
them
i
just
had
to
do
it
alone
that
is
with
pete
scoffed
hartwell
pete
indeed
billy
head
came
up
with
a
jerk
billy
was
very
angry
now
aunt
kate
it
seems
i
done
a
very
terrible
thing
but
i
sure
i
do
see
it
that
way
i
was
afraid
and
i
was
in
the
least
bit
of
danger
anywhere
i
knew
my
way
perfectly
and
i
did
not
make
any
in
that
restaurant
i
just
asked
bertram
to
come
home
with
me
one
would
think
you
wanted
bertram
to
go
off
with
that
man
and
and
drink
too
much
but
uncle
william
has
liked
him
before
not
one
bit
i
heard
him
talk
about
him
that
hartwell
raised
both
her
hands
palms
outward
billy
it
is
useless
to
talk
with
you
you
are
quite
impossible
it
is
even
worse
than
i
expected
she
cried
with
wrathful
impatience
worse
than
you
expected
what
do
you
mean
please
worse
than
i
thought
it
would
be
before
you
came
the
idea
of
those
five
men
taking
a
girl
to
bring
up
billy
sat
very
still
she
was
even
holding
her
breath
though
hartwell
did
not
know
that
you
mean
that
they
did
not
want
me
she
asked
quietly
so
quietly
that
hartwell
did
not
realize
the
sudden
tension
behind
the
words
for
that
matter
hartwell
was
too
angry
now
to
realize
anything
outside
of
herself
want
you
billy
it
is
high
time
that
you
understand
just
how
things
are
and
have
been
at
the
house
then
perhaps
you
will
conduct
yourself
with
an
eye
a
little
more
to
other
people
comfort
can
you
imagine
three
young
men
like
my
brothers
wanting
to
take
a
strange
young
woman
into
their
home
to
upset
everything
to
upset
everything
echoed
billy
faintly
and
have
i
done
that
of
course
you
have
how
could
you
help
it
to
begin
with
they
thought
you
were
a
boy
and
that
was
bad
enough
but
william
was
so
anxious
to
do
right
by
his
dead
friend
that
he
insisted
upon
taking
you
much
against
the
will
of
all
the
rest
of
us
oh
i
know
this
is
pleasant
for
you
to
hear
admitted
hartwell
in
response
to
the
dismayed
expression
in
billy
eyes
but
i
think
it
high
time
you
realize
something
of
what
those
men
have
sacrificed
for
you
now
to
resume
when
they
found
you
were
a
girl
what
did
they
do
did
they
turn
you
over
to
some
school
or
such
place
as
they
should
have
done
certainly
not
william
would
not
hear
of
it
he
turned
bertram
out
of
his
rooms
put
you
into
them
and
established
aunt
hannah
as
chaperon
and
me
as
substitute
until
she
arrived
but
because
through
it
all
he
smiled
blandly
you
have
been
blind
to
the
whole
thing
and
what
is
the
result
his
entire
household
routine
is
shattered
to
atoms
you
have
accepted
the
whole
house
as
if
it
were
your
own
you
take
cyril
time
to
teach
you
music
and
bertram
to
teach
you
painting
without
a
thought
of
what
it
means
to
them
there
i
suppose
i
ought
not
to
have
said
all
this
but
i
could
help
it
billy
and
surely
now
now
you
appreciate
a
little
more
what
your
coming
to
this
house
has
meant
and
what
my
brothers
have
done
for
i
do
certainly
said
billy
still
in
that
voice
that
was
so
oddly
smooth
and
emotionless
and
you
try
to
be
more
tractable
less
headstrong
less
assertive
of
your
presence
the
girl
sprang
to
her
feet
now
more
tractable
less
assertive
of
my
presence
she
cried
mrs
hartwell
do
you
mean
to
say
you
think
i
stay
after
what
you
told
me
stay
why
of
course
you
stay
do
be
silly
child
i
did
tell
you
this
to
make
you
go
i
only
wanted
you
to
understand
how
things
were
and
and
i
do
understand
and
i
hartwell
frowned
her
face
changed
color
come
come
billy
this
is
nonsense
william
wants
you
here
he
would
never
forgive
me
if
anything
i
said
should
send
you
away
you
must
not
be
angry
with
billy
turned
now
like
an
enraged
little
tigress
angry
with
him
why
i
love
him
i
love
them
all
they
are
the
dearest
men
ever
and
they
been
so
good
to
me
the
girl
voice
broke
a
little
then
went
on
with
a
more
determined
ring
do
you
think
i
have
them
know
why
i
going
that
i
hurt
them
like
that
never
but
billy
what
are
you
going
to
do
i
do
know
i
got
to
plan
it
out
i
only
know
now
that
i
going
sure
and
with
a
choking
little
cry
billy
ran
from
the
room
in
her
own
chamber
a
minute
later
the
tears
fell
unrestrained
it
home
all
the
home
there
is
anywhere
she
sobbed
but
it
got
to
go
it
got
to
go
chapter

a
trail
stetson
wore
an
air
of
unmistakable
relief
as
she
stepped
into
william
even
her
knock
at
the
door
had
sounded
almost
triumphant
william
it
does
seem
as
if
fate
itself
had
intervened
to
help
us
out
she
began
delightedly
billy
of
her
own
accord
came
to
me
this
morning
and
said
that
she
wanted
to
go
away
with
me
for
a
little
trip
so
you
see
that
will
make
it
easier
for
good
that
is
fortunate
indeed
cried
william
but
his
voice
did
not
carry
quite
the
joy
that
his
words
expressed
i
have
been
disturbed
ever
since
your
remarks
the
other
day
he
continued
wearily
and
of
course
her
extraordinary
escapade
the
next
evening
did
not
help
matters
any
it
is
better
i
know
that
she
should
be
here
for
a
time
though
i
shall
miss
her
terribly
but
tell
me
what
is
it
what
does
she
want
to
do
she
says
she
guesses
she
is
homesick
for
hampden
falls
that
like
to
go
back
there
for
a
few
weeks
this
summer
if
i
go
with
her
the
the
dear
child
seems
suddenly
to
have
taken
a
great
fancy
to
me
explained
aunt
hannah
unsteadily
i
never
saw
her
so
she
is
a
dear
girl
a
very
dear
girl
and
she
has
a
warm
william
cleared
his
throat
sonorously
but
even
that
did
not
clear
his
voice
it
was
her
heart
that
led
her
wrong
the
other
night
he
declared
hers
was
a
brave
and
fearless
act
but
a
very
unwise
one
much
as
i
deplore
bertram
intimacy
with
seaver
i
should
hesitate
to
take
the
course
marked
out
by
billy
bertram
is
not
a
child
but
tell
me
more
of
this
trip
of
yours
how
did
billy
happen
to
suggest
it
i
do
know
i
noticed
yesterday
that
she
seemed
strangely
silent
unhappy
in
fact
she
sat
alone
in
her
room
the
greater
part
of
the
day
and
i
could
not
get
her
out
of
it
but
this
morning
she
came
to
my
door
as
bright
as
the
sun
itself
and
made
me
the
proposition
i
told
you
of
she
says
her
aunt
house
is
closed
awaiting
its
sale
but
that
she
would
like
to
open
it
for
awhile
this
summer
if
i
like
to
go
naturally
you
can
understand
that
i
very
quickly
fall
in
with
a
plan
like
that
one
which
promised
so
easily
to
settle
our
yes
of
course
of
course
muttered
william
it
is
very
fine
very
fine
indeed
he
concluded
and
again
his
voice
failed
quite
to
match
his
words
in
enthusiasm
then
i
go
and
begin
to
see
to
my
things
murmured
stetson
rising
to
her
feet
billy
seems
anxious
to
get
billy
did
indeed
seem
anxious
to
get
away
she
announced
her
intended
departure
at
once
to
the
family
she
called
it
a
visit
to
her
old
home
and
she
seemed
very
glad
in
her
preparations
if
there
was
anything
forced
in
this
gayety
no
one
noticed
it
or
at
least
no
one
spoke
of
it
the
family
saw
very
little
of
billy
indeed
these
days
she
said
that
she
was
busy
that
she
had
packing
to
do
she
stopped
taking
lessons
of
cyril
and
visited
bertram
studio
only
once
during
the
whole
three
days
before
she
went
away
and
then
merely
to
get
some
things
that
belonged
to
her
on
the
fourth
day
almost
before
the
family
realized
what
was
happening
she
was
gone
and
with
her
had
gone
stetson
and
spunk
the
family
said
they
liked
it
the
quiet
the
freedom
they
said
they
liked
to
be
alone
all
but
william
he
said
nothing
and
yet
when
bertram
went
to
his
studio
that
morning
he
did
not
pick
up
his
brushes
until
he
had
sat
for
long
minutes
before
the
sketch
of
a
young
girl
whose
eyes
held
a
peculiarly
wistful
appeal
and
cyril
at
his
piano
sat
with
idle
fingers
until
they
finally
drifted
into
a
simple
little
melody
the
last
thing
billy
had
been
learning
it
was
pete
who
brought
in
the
kitten
and
billy
had
been
gone
a
whole
week
then
the
poor
little
beast
was
cryin
at
the
alleyway
door
sir
he
explained
i
i
made
so
bold
as
to
bring
him
of
course
said
william
did
you
feed
it
yes
sir
ling
there
was
a
pause
then
pete
spoke
diffidently
i
thought
sir
if
ye
did
mind
i
keep
it
i
try
to
see
that
it
stays
sir
out
of
yer
that
all
right
pete
keep
it
by
all
means
by
all
means
approved
william
thank
ye
sir
ye
see
it
a
stray
it
has
got
any
home
and
did
ye
notice
sir
it
looks
like
yes
i
noticed
said
william
stirring
with
sudden
restlessness
i
yes
sir
said
pete
and
he
turned
and
carried
the
small
gray
cat
away
the
new
kitten
did
not
stay
pete
tried
it
is
true
to
keep
his
promise
to
watch
it
but
after
he
had
seen
the
little
animal
carried
surreptitiously
in
william
arms
he
relaxed
his
vigilance
some
days
later
the
kitten
appeared
with
a
huge
pink
bow
behind
its
ears
somewhat
awkwardly
tied
if
it
must
be
confessed
where
it
came
from
or
who
put
it
there
was
not
known
until
one
day
the
kitten
was
found
in
the
hall
delightedly
chewing
at
the
end
of
what
had
been
a
roll
of
pink
ribbon
up
the
stairs
led
a
trail
of
pink
ribbon
and
curling
white
paper
and
the
end
of
the
trail
was
in
william
room
chapter
xviii
billy
writes
another
letter
by
the
middle
of
june
only
william
and
the
gray
kitten
were
left
with
pete
and
dong
ling
in
the
beacon
street
house
cyril
had
sailed
for
england
and
bertram
had
gone
on
a
sketching
trip
with
a
friend
to
william
the
house
this
summer
was
unusually
lonely
indeed
he
found
the
silent
deserted
rooms
almost
unbearable
even
the
presence
of
the
little
gray
cat
served
only
to
accentuate
the
loneliness
it
reminded
him
of
billy
william
missed
billy
he
owned
that
now
even
to
pete
he
said
that
he
would
be
glad
when
she
came
back
to
himself
he
said
that
he
wished
he
had
not
fallen
in
quite
so
readily
with
aunt
hannah
notion
of
getting
the
child
away
it
was
all
nonsense
he
declared
all
she
needed
was
a
little
curbing
and
directing
both
of
which
could
just
as
well
have
been
done
there
at
home
but
she
had
gone
and
it
could
not
be
helped
now
the
only
thing
left
for
him
to
do
was
to
see
that
it
did
not
occur
again
when
billy
came
back
she
should
stay
except
for
necessary
absences
for
school
of
course
all
this
william
settled
in
his
own
mind
quite
to
his
own
satisfaction
entirely
forgetting
strange
to
say
that
it
had
been
billy
own
suggestion
that
she
go
away
very
promptly
william
wrote
to
billy
he
told
her
how
he
missed
her
and
said
that
he
had
stopped
trying
to
sort
and
catalogue
his
collections
until
she
should
be
there
to
help
him
he
told
her
too
after
a
time
of
the
gray
kitten
spunkie
that
looked
so
much
like
spunk
in
reply
he
received
plump
white
envelopes
directed
in
the
round
schoolboy
hand
that
he
remembered
so
well
in
the
envelopes
were
letters
cheery
and
entertaining
like
billy
herself
they
thanked
him
for
all
his
many
kindnesses
and
they
told
him
something
of
what
billy
was
doing
they
showed
unbounded
interest
in
the
new
kitten
and
in
all
else
that
william
wrote
about
but
they
hinted
very
plainly
that
he
had
better
not
wait
for
her
to
help
him
out
on
the
catalogue
for
it
would
soon
be
autumn
and
she
would
be
in
school
william
frowned
at
this
and
shook
his
head
yet
he
knew
that
it
was
true
in
august
william
closed
the
beacon
street
house
and
went
to
the
rangeley
lakes
on
a
camping
trip
he
told
himself
that
he
would
not
go
had
it
not
been
for
a
promise
given
to
an
old
college
friend
months
before
true
he
had
been
anticipating
this
trip
all
winter
but
it
occurred
to
him
now
that
it
would
be
much
more
interesting
to
go
to
hampden
falls
and
see
billy
he
had
been
to
the
rangeley
lakes
and
he
had
not
been
to
hampden
falls
besides
there
would
be
ned
harding
and
those
queer
old
maids
with
their
shaded
house
and
socketed
chairs
to
see
in
short
to
william
at
the
moment
there
seemed
no
place
quite
so
absorbingly
interesting
as
was
hampden
falls
but
he
went
to
the
rangeley
lakes
in
september
cyril
came
back
from
europe
and
bertram
from
the
adirondacks
where
he
had
been
spending
the
month
of
august
william
already
had
arrived
and
with
pete
and
dong
ling
had
opened
the
house
where
billy
is
billy
here
demanded
bertram
no
she
is
back
yet
replied
william
you
do
mean
to
say
she
stayed
up
there
all
summer
exclaimed
cyril
why
yes
i
i
suppose
so
hesitated
william
you
see
i
heard
but
once
for
a
month
i
been
down
in
maine
you
william
wrote
to
billy
that
night
my
dear
he
said
in
part
i
hope
you
come
home
right
away
we
want
to
see
something
of
you
before
you
go
away
again
and
you
know
the
schools
will
be
opening
soon
by
the
way
it
has
just
occurred
to
me
as
i
write
that
perhaps
after
all
you
wo
have
to
go
quite
away
there
are
plenty
of
good
schools
for
young
ladies
right
in
and
near
boston
which
i
am
sure
you
could
attend
and
still
live
at
home
suppose
you
come
back
then
as
soon
as
you
can
and
we
talk
it
up
and
that
reminds
me
i
wonder
how
spunk
will
get
along
with
spunkie
spunkie
has
been
boarding
out
all
august
at
a
cat
home
but
he
seems
glad
to
get
back
to
us
i
am
anxious
to
see
the
two
little
chaps
together
just
to
find
out
how
much
alike
they
really
do
very
promptly
came
billy
answer
but
william
face
after
he
had
read
the
letter
was
almost
as
blank
as
it
had
been
on
that
april
day
when
billy
first
letter
came
though
this
time
for
a
far
different
reason
why
boys
she
is
coming
he
announced
in
dismay
is
coming
ejaculated
two
astonished
voices
not
at
all
why
of
course
later
retorted
william
with
unwonted
sharpness
but
not
now
this
is
what
she
and
he
read
aloud
dear
uncle
william
you
poor
dear
man
did
you
think
i
really
let
you
spend
your
time
and
your
thought
over
hunting
up
a
school
for
me
after
all
the
rest
you
have
done
for
me
not
a
bit
of
it
why
aunt
hannah
and
i
have
been
buried
under
school
catalogues
all
summer
and
i
have
studied
them
all
until
i
know
just
which
has
turkey
dinners
on
sundays
and
which
ice
cream
at
least
twice
a
week
and
it
all
settled
too
long
ago
i
going
to
a
girls
school
up
the
hudson
a
little
way
a
lovely
place
i
sure
from
the
pictures
of
it
oh
and
another
thing
i
shall
go
right
from
here
two
girls
at
hampden
falls
are
going
and
i
shall
go
with
them
is
that
a
fine
chance
for
me
you
see
it
would
never
do
anyway
for
me
to
go
alone
me
a
unless
i
sent
a
special
courier
ahead
to
announce
that
was
a
girl
aunt
hannah
has
decided
to
stay
here
this
winter
in
the
old
house
she
likes
it
ever
so
much
and
i
do
think
i
shall
sell
the
place
just
yet
anyway
she
will
go
back
of
course
to
boston
after
i
gone
to
get
some
things
at
the
house
that
she
want
and
also
to
do
some
shopping
but
she
let
you
know
when
she
be
there
i
write
more
later
but
just
now
i
in
a
terrible
rush
i
only
write
this
note
to
set
your
poor
heart
at
rest
about
having
to
hunt
up
a
school
for
me
with
love
to
all
as
had
happened
once
before
after
a
letter
from
billy
had
been
read
there
was
a
long
pause
well
by
jove
breathed
bertram
it
very
sensible
i
sure
declared
cyril
still
i
must
confess
i
would
have
liked
to
pick
out
her
piano
teacher
for
william
said
nothing
perhaps
because
he
was
reading
billy
letter
again
at
eight
that
night
bertram
tapped
on
cyril
door
what
the
trouble
demanded
cyril
in
answer
to
the
look
on
the
other
face
bertram
lifted
his
eyebrows
oddly
i
not
sure
whether
you
call
it
or
not
he
replied
but
i
think
it
safe
to
say
that
billy
is
gone
for
for
good
what
do
you
mean
that
she
not
coming
back
ever
exactly
nonsense
what
put
that
notion
into
your
head
billy
letter
first
after
that
pete
yes
he
came
to
me
a
few
minutes
ago
looking
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
it
seems
he
swept
billy
rooms
this
morning
and
put
them
in
order
against
her
coming
and
tonight
william
told
him
that
she
be
here
at
present
pete
came
straight
to
me
he
said
he
did
dare
tell
william
but
he
got
to
tell
some
one
there
was
one
single
thing
of
miss
billy
left
in
her
rooms
nor
anywhere
else
in
the
house
not
so
much
as
a
handkerchief
or
a
that
does
look
suspicious
murmured
cyril
what
up
do
you
think
do
know
but
something
sure
still
of
course
we
may
be
wrong
we
wo
say
anything
to
will
about
it
anyhow
poor
old
chap
worry
him
specially
if
he
thought
billy
feelings
had
been
hurt
nonsense
why
we
did
everything
for
her
everything
yes
i
know
and
she
tried
to
do
everything
for
us
too
retorted
bertram
quizzically
as
he
turned
away
chapter
xix
seeing
billy
off
early
in
october
stetson
arrived
at
the
beacon
street
house
but
she
did
not
stay
long
i
come
for
just
a
few
things
i
want
and
to
do
some
shopping
she
explained
but
aunt
hannah
remonstrated
william
what
is
the
meaning
of
this
why
are
you
staying
up
there
at
hampden
falls
i
like
it
there
william
and
why
should
i
stay
surely
there
no
need
for
me
to
be
here
now
with
billy
away
but
billy
coming
back
of
course
she
coming
back
laughed
aunt
hannah
but
not
this
winter
certainly
why
william
what
the
matter
i
sure
i
think
it
a
beautiful
arrangement
why
do
you
remember
it
just
what
we
said
we
wanted
to
keep
billy
away
for
awhile
and
the
best
part
of
it
is
it
her
own
idea
from
the
yes
i
know
i
know
frowned
william
but
i
not
sure
after
all
that
that
idea
of
ours
was
a
mistake
a
mistake
that
she
needed
to
get
never
we
were
just
right
about
it
declared
aunt
hannah
with
conviction
and
is
billy
happy
she
seems
to
well
that
good
said
william
as
he
turned
to
go
up
to
his
room
but
as
he
climbed
the
stairs
he
sighed
and
to
hear
him
one
would
have
thought
it
anything
but
good
to
him
that
billy
was
happy
one
by
one
the
weeks
passed
stetson
had
long
since
gone
back
to
hampden
falls
and
bertram
said
that
the
strata
was
beginning
to
look
natural
again
there
remained
now
indeed
only
spunkie
the
small
gray
cat
to
remind
any
one
of
the
days
that
were
gone
though
to
be
sure
there
were
billy
letters
if
they
might
be
called
a
reminder
billy
did
not
write
often
she
said
that
she
was
too
busy
to
such
letters
as
did
come
from
her
were
addressed
to
william
though
they
soon
came
to
be
claimed
by
the
entire
family
bertram
and
cyril
frankly
demanded
that
william
read
them
aloud
and
even
pete
always
contrived
to
have
some
dusting
or
puttering
within
earshot
a
subterfuge
quite
well
understood
but
never
reproved
by
any
of
the
brothers
when
the
christmas
vacation
drew
near
william
wrote
that
he
hoped
billy
and
aunt
hannah
would
spend
it
with
them
but
billy
answered
that
although
she
appreciated
their
kindness
and
thanked
them
for
it
yet
she
must
decline
their
invitation
as
she
had
already
invited
several
of
the
girls
to
go
home
with
her
to
hampden
falls
for
a
country
christmas
for
the
easter
vacation
william
was
even
more
insistent
but
so
was
billy
she
had
already
accepted
an
invitation
to
go
home
with
one
of
the
girls
and
she
did
not
think
it
would
be
at
all
polite
to
change
her
plans
now
william
fretted
not
a
little
even
cyril
and
bertram
said
that
it
was
too
bad
that
they
themselves
would
like
to
see
the
girl
so
they
would
it
was
in
the
spring
at
the
close
of
school
however
that
the
heaviest
blow
fell
billy
was
not
coming
to
boston
even
then
she
wrote
that
she
and
aunt
hannah
were
going
to
run
across
the
water
for
a
little
trip
through
the
british
isles
and
that
their
passage
was
already
engaged
and
so
you
see
she
explained
i
shall
not
have
a
minute
to
spare
there
be
only
time
to
skip
home
for
aunt
hannah
and
to
pack
the
trunks
before
it
be
time
to
bertram
looked
at
cyril
significantly
when
this
letter
was
read
aloud
and
afterward
he
muttered
in
cyril
ear
you
see
it
hampden
falls
she
calls
now
not
the
yes
i
see
frowned
cyril
it
does
look
two
days
before
the
date
of
billy
expected
sailing
william
announced
at
the
breakfast
table
that
he
was
going
away
on
business
might
be
gone
until
the
end
of
the
week
you
do
say
commented
bertram
i
going
but
i
coming
back
in
a
couple
of
murmured
william
abstractedly
oh
well
i
may
be
back
before
the
end
of
the
only
one
meal
did
cyril
eat
alone
after
his
brothers
had
gone
then
he
told
pete
that
he
had
decided
to
take
the
night
boat
for
new
york
there
was
a
little
matter
that
called
him
there
he
said
and
he
believed
the
trip
by
water
would
be
a
pleasure
the
night
was
so
fine
and
warm
in
new
york
cyril
had
little
trouble
in
finding
billy
as
he
knew
the
steamship
she
was
to
take
i
thought
as
long
as
i
was
in
new
york
i
just
come
and
say
to
you
and
aunt
hannah
he
informed
her
with
an
evident
aim
toward
making
his
presence
appear
to
be
casual
that
was
good
of
you
exclaimed
billy
and
how
are
uncle
william
and
bertram
very
well
i
fancy
though
they
were
there
when
i
left
replied
the
man
oh
gone
away
yes
a
little
matter
of
business
they
said
but
well
by
jove
he
broke
off
his
gaze
on
a
familiar
figure
hurrying
at
that
moment
toward
them
there
william
now
william
with
no
eyes
but
for
billy
came
rapidly
forward
well
well
billy
i
thought
as
long
as
i
happened
to
be
in
new
york
i
just
run
down
to
the
boat
and
see
you
and
aunt
hannah
off
and
wish
cyril
where
did
you
come
from
billy
laughed
he
just
happened
to
be
in
town
too
uncle
william
like
you
she
explained
and
i
sure
i
think
it
lovely
of
you
to
be
so
kind
aunt
hannah
be
up
right
away
she
went
down
to
the
stateroom
to
this
time
it
was
billy
who
stopped
abruptly
the
two
men
facing
her
could
not
see
what
she
saw
and
not
until
their
brother
bertram
merry
greeting
fell
on
their
ears
did
they
understand
her
sudden
silence
and
is
this
the
way
you
meant
to
run
away
from
us
young
lady
cried
bertram
not
so
fast
you
see
i
happened
to
be
in
new
york
this
morning
and
so
i
something
in
billy
face
sent
a
pause
to
his
words
just
as
his
eyes
spied
the
two
men
at
the
girl
side
for
a
moment
he
stared
dumbly
then
he
gave
a
merry
gesture
of
defeat
it
all
up
i
might
as
well
confess
i
been
planning
this
thing
for
three
weeks
billy
ever
since
your
letter
came
in
fact
as
for
my
two
here
i
wager
they
were
two
days
behind
me
in
their
planning
so
now
own
up
boys
william
and
cyril
however
did
not
have
to
own
stetson
appeared
at
the
moment
and
created
for
them
a
very
welcome
diversion
long
minutes
later
when
the
had
become
nothing
but
a
flutter
of
white
handkerchiefs
from
deck
to
shore
and
shore
to
deck
william
drew
a
long
sigh
that
a
nice
little
girl
boys
a
nice
little
girl
he
exclaimed
i
declare
i
did
suppose
i
mind
so
much
her
going
so
far
chapter
xx
billy
the
myth
to
all
appearances
it
came
about
very
naturally
that
billy
did
not
return
to
america
for
some
time
during
the
summer
she
wrote
occasionally
to
william
and
gave
glowing
accounts
of
their
travels
then
in
september
came
the
letter
telling
him
that
they
had
concluded
to
stay
through
the
winter
in
paris
billy
wrote
that
she
had
decided
not
to
go
to
college
she
would
take
up
some
studies
there
in
paris
she
said
but
she
would
devote
herself
more
particularly
to
her
music
when
the
next
summer
came
there
was
still
something
other
than
america
to
claim
her
attention
the
calderwells
had
invited
her
to
cruise
with
them
for
three
months
their
yacht
was
a
little
floating
palace
of
delight
billy
declared
not
to
mention
the
charm
of
the
unknown
lands
and
waters
that
she
and
aunt
hannah
would
see
of
all
this
billy
wrote
to
william
at
occasional
intervals
but
she
did
not
come
home
even
when
the
next
autumn
came
there
was
still
paris
to
detain
her
for
another
long
winter
of
study
in
the
henshaw
house
on
beacon
street
william
mourned
not
a
little
as
each
recurring
season
brought
no
billy
the
idea
it
just
as
if
one
did
have
a
namesake
he
fumed
well
did
you
have
one
bertram
demanded
one
day
really
will
beginning
to
think
she
a
myth
long
years
ago
from
the
first
of
april
till
june
we
did
have
two
frolicsome
sprites
here
that
announced
themselves
as
and
i
own
and
a
year
later
by
ways
devious
and
secret
we
three
managed
to
see
the
one
called
off
on
a
great
steamship
since
then
what
a
word
a
message
a
scrap
of
paper
billy
a
myth
i
say
william
sighed
sometimes
i
do
know
but
you
are
right
he
admitted
why
be
three
years
next
june
since
billy
was
here
she
must
be
nearly
and
we
know
almost
nothing
about
that
so
i
wonder
bertram
paused
and
laughed
a
little
i
wonder
if
now
she
play
guardian
angel
to
me
through
the
streets
of
william
threw
a
keen
glance
into
his
brother
face
i
do
believe
it
would
be
quite
necessary
now
bert
he
said
quietly
the
other
flushed
a
little
but
his
eyes
softened
maybe
not
will
still
one
can
always
find
some
use
for
a
guardian
angel
you
know
he
finished
almost
under
his
breath
to
cyril
bertram
had
occasionally
spoken
during
the
last
two
years
of
their
first
suspicions
concerning
billy
absence
they
speculated
vaguely
too
as
to
why
she
had
gone
and
if
she
would
ever
come
back
and
they
wondered
if
anything
could
have
wounded
her
and
sent
her
away
to
william
they
said
nothing
of
all
this
however
though
they
agreed
that
they
would
have
asked
kate
for
her
opinion
had
she
been
there
but
kate
was
not
there
as
it
chanced
a
good
business
opportunity
had
called
kate
husband
to
a
western
town
very
soon
after
billy
herself
had
gone
to
hampden
falls
and
since
the
family
removal
to
the
west
hartwell
had
not
once
returned
to
boston
it
was
in
april
three
years
since
billy
first
appearance
in
the
beacon
street
house
that
bertram
met
his
friend
hugh
calderwell
on
the
street
one
afternoon
and
brought
him
home
to
dinner
hugh
calderwell
was
a
youth
who
bertram
said
had
been
born
with
a
whole
dozen
silver
spoons
in
his
mouth
and
indeed
it
would
seem
so
if
present
prosperity
were
any
indication
he
was
a
young
fellow
with
a
frank
manliness
that
appealed
to
men
and
a
deferential
chivalry
that
appealed
to
women
a
combination
that
brought
him
many
friends
and
some
enemies
with
plenty
of
money
to
indulge
a
passion
for
traveling
young
calderwell
had
spent
the
most
of
his
time
since
graduation
in
daring
trips
into
the
heart
of
almost
impenetrable
forests
or
to
the
top
of
almost
inaccessible
mountains
with
an
occasional
more
ordinary
trip
to
give
variety
he
had
now
come
to
the
point
however
where
he
was
determined
to
settle
down
to
something
that
meant
something
he
told
the
henshaws
as
the
four
men
smoked
in
bertram
den
after
dinner
yes
sir
i
have
he
iterated
and
by
the
way
the
little
girl
that
has
set
me
to
thinking
in
such
good
earnest
is
a
friend
of
yours
too
miss
neilson
i
met
her
in
paris
she
was
on
our
yacht
all
last
three
men
sat
suddenly
erect
in
their
chairs
billy
cried
three
voices
do
you
know
billy
to
be
sure
and
you
do
too
she
oh
no
we
do
disputed
bertram
emphatically
but
we
wish
we
did
his
guest
laughed
well
i
fancy
you
do
know
her
or
you
would
have
answered
like
that
he
retorted
for
you
just
begin
to
know
miss
billy
when
you
find
out
that
you
do
know
her
she
is
a
charming
girl
a
very
charming
she
is
my
namesake
announced
william
in
what
bertram
called
his
finest
ever
voice
that
he
used
only
for
the
choicest
bits
in
his
collections
yes
she
told
me
smiled
calderwell
for
odd
idea
too
but
clever
it
helps
to
distinguish
her
even
more
though
she
does
need
it
for
that
need
it
echoed
william
in
a
puzzled
voice
no
perhaps
you
do
know
henshaw
but
miss
billy
is
a
very
popular
young
woman
you
have
reason
to
be
proud
of
your
i
have
always
been
that
declared
william
with
just
a
touch
of
hauteur
tell
us
about
her
begged
bertram
you
remember
i
said
that
we
wished
we
did
know
calderwell
smiled
i
do
believe
after
all
that
you
do
know
much
about
her
he
began
musingly
billy
is
not
one
who
talks
much
of
herself
i
fancy
in
her
william
frowned
this
time
there
was
more
than
a
touch
of
hauteur
in
his
voice
miss
neilson
is
not
one
to
show
vanity
anywhere
he
said
with
suggestive
emphasis
on
the
name
indeed
she
is
agreed
calderwell
heartily
she
is
a
fine
girl
quite
one
of
the
finest
i
know
in
there
was
an
uncomfortable
silence
over
in
the
corner
cyril
puffed
at
his
cigar
with
an
air
almost
of
boredom
he
had
not
spoken
since
his
first
surprised
questioning
with
the
others
do
you
know
billy
william
was
still
frowning
even
bertram
wore
a
look
that
was
not
quite
satisfied
miss
neilson
has
spent
two
winters
in
paris
now
you
know
resumed
calderwell
after
a
moment
and
she
is
very
popular
both
with
the
american
colony
and
with
the
other
students
as
for
her
hannah
they
all
make
a
pet
of
her
but
that
is
perhaps
because
billy
herself
is
so
again
william
frowned
at
the
familiar
billy
but
calderwell
talked
on
unheeding
after
all
i
not
sure
but
some
of
us
regard
hannah
with
scant
favor
occasionally
he
laughed
something
as
if
she
were
the
dragon
that
guarded
the
princess
you
know
miss
billy
is
popular
with
the
men
and
she
has
suitors
enough
to
turn
any
girl
head
but
her
suitors
cried
william
plainly
aghast
why
billy
nothing
but
a
child
calderwell
gave
an
odd
smile
how
long
is
it
since
you
seen
miss
neilson
he
asked
two
and
then
only
for
a
few
minutes
just
before
she
sailed
amended
bertram
we
have
really
seen
much
of
her
since
three
years
well
you
see
for
yourself
soon
you
know
she
coming
home
next
not
one
of
the
brothers
did
know
it
but
not
one
of
them
intended
that
calderwell
should
find
out
that
they
did
not
yes
she
coming
home
said
william
lifting
his
chin
a
little
oh
yes
next
month
added
bertram
nonchalantly
even
cyril
across
the
room
was
not
to
be
outdone
yes
miss
neilson
comes
home
next
month
he
said
chapter
xxi
billy
the
reality
very
early
in
may
came
the
cheery
letter
from
billy
herself
announcing
the
news
of
her
intended
return
and
i
shall
be
so
glad
to
see
you
all
she
wrote
in
closing
it
seems
so
long
since
i
left
then
she
signed
her
name
with
kindest
regards
to
all
billy
did
not
send
love
to
all
any
more
william
at
once
began
to
make
plans
for
his
namesake
comfort
but
will
she
did
say
she
was
coming
here
bertram
reminded
him
she
did
need
to
smiled
william
confidently
she
just
took
it
for
granted
of
course
this
is
her
but
it
has
been
for
years
she
called
hampden
falls
i
know
but
that
was
before
demurred
william
his
eyes
a
little
anxious
besides
they
sold
the
house
now
you
know
there
nowhere
for
her
to
go
but
here
all
right
acquiesced
the
younger
man
still
doubtingly
maybe
so
maybe
but
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
and
his
eyes
were
troubled
as
he
watched
his
brother
begin
to
rearrange
billy
rooms
in
time
however
so
sure
was
william
of
billy
return
to
the
beacon
street
house
that
bertram
ceased
to
question
and
with
almost
as
much
confidence
as
william
himself
displayed
he
devoted
his
energies
to
the
preparations
for
billy
arrival
and
what
preparations
they
were
even
cyril
helped
this
time
to
the
extent
of
placing
on
billy
piano
a
copy
of
his
latest
book
and
a
pile
of
new
music
nor
were
the
melodies
that
floated
down
from
the
upper
floor
akin
to
funeral
marches
they
were
perilously
near
to
being
allied
to
at
last
everything
was
ready
there
was
not
one
more
bit
of
dust
to
catch
pete
eye
nor
one
more
adornment
that
demanded
william
careful
hand
to
adjust
in
billy
rooms
new
curtains
graced
the
windows
and
new
rugs
the
floors
in
stetson
too
similar
changes
had
been
made
the
latest
and
best
face
of
a
girl
smiled
at
one
from
above
billy
piano
and
the
very
rarest
of
william
treasures
adorned
the
mantelpiece
no
guns
nor
knives
nor
met
the
eyes
now
instead
at
every
turn
there
was
a
hint
of
feminine
tastes
a
mirror
a
workbasket
a
low
a
stand
with
a
tea
tray
and
everywhere
were
roses
and
until
the
air
was
heavy
with
their
perfume
in
the
pete
was
again
swinging
back
and
forth
like
a
pendulum
it
is
true
but
it
was
a
cheerful
pendulum
anxious
only
that
no
time
should
be
lost
in
the
kitchen
alone
was
there
unhappiness
and
there
because
dong
ling
had
already
spoiled
a
whole
cake
of
chocolate
in
a
vain
attempt
to
make
billy
favorite
fudge
even
spunkie
grown
now
to
be
sleek
lazy
and
majestically
indifferent
was
in
holiday
attire
for
a
pink
bow
of
huge
dimensions
adorned
his
fat
neck
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
you
see
william
had
explained
to
bertram
i
put
on
that
ribbon
again
because
i
thought
it
would
make
spunkie
seem
more
homelike
and
more
like
spunk
you
know
there
was
anything
billy
missed
so
much
as
that
kitten
when
she
went
abroad
aunt
hannah
said
yes
i
know
bertram
had
laughed
but
still
spunkie
is
spunk
you
understand
he
had
finished
with
a
vision
in
his
eyes
of
billy
as
she
had
looked
that
first
night
when
she
had
triumphantly
lifted
from
the
green
basket
the
little
gray
kitten
with
its
enormous
pink
bow
this
time
there
was
no
circuitous
journeying
no
secrecy
in
the
trip
to
new
york
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
the
three
brother
made
their
plans
to
meet
billy
and
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
they
met
her
perhaps
the
only
cloud
in
the
horizon
of
their
happiness
was
the
presence
of
calderwell
he
too
had
come
to
meet
billy
and
all
the
henshaw
brothers
were
vaguely
conscious
of
a
growing
feeling
of
dislike
toward
calderwell
billy
was
unmistakably
glad
to
see
them
and
to
see
calderwell
it
was
while
she
was
talking
to
calderwell
indeed
that
william
and
cyril
and
bertram
had
an
opportunity
really
to
see
the
girl
and
to
note
what
time
had
done
for
her
they
knew
then
at
once
that
time
had
been
very
kind
it
was
a
slim
billy
that
they
saw
with
a
head
royally
poised
and
a
chin
that
was
round
and
soft
and
yet
knew
well
its
own
mind
the
eyes
were
still
appealing
in
a
way
yet
behind
the
appeal
lay
unsounded
depths
of
not
one
of
the
brothers
could
quite
make
up
his
mind
just
what
yet
all
the
brothers
determined
to
find
out
the
hair
still
curled
distractingly
behind
the
pretty
ears
and
fluffed
into
burnished
bronze
where
the
wind
had
loosened
it
the
cheeks
were
paler
now
though
the
still
glowed
warmly
through
the
clear
smooth
skin
the
mouth
billy
mouth
had
always
been
fascinating
bertram
suddenly
decided
as
he
watched
it
now
he
wanted
to
paint
it
again
it
was
not
too
large
for
beauty
nor
too
small
for
strength
it
curved
delightfully
and
the
lower
lip
had
just
the
fullness
and
the
color
that
he
liked
to
paint
he
said
to
himself
william
too
was
watching
billy
mouth
in
fact
though
he
did
not
know
it
one
never
was
long
near
billy
without
noticing
her
mouth
if
she
talked
william
thought
it
pretty
merry
and
charmingly
kissable
but
just
now
he
wished
that
it
would
talk
to
him
and
not
to
calderwell
any
longer
cyril
indeed
cyril
was
paying
little
attention
to
billy
he
had
turned
to
aunt
hannah
to
tell
the
truth
it
seemed
to
cyril
that
after
all
billy
was
very
much
like
other
merry
thoughtless
rather
noisy
young
women
of
whom
he
knew
and
disliked
scores
it
had
occurred
to
him
suddenly
that
perhaps
it
would
not
be
unalloyed
bliss
to
take
this
young
namesake
of
william
home
with
them
it
was
not
until
an
hour
later
when
billy
aunt
hannah
and
the
henshaws
had
reached
the
hotel
where
they
were
to
spend
the
night
that
the
henshaw
brothers
began
really
to
get
acquainted
with
billy
she
seemed
then
more
like
their
own
billy
the
billy
that
they
had
known
and
i
so
glad
to
be
here
she
cried
and
to
see
you
all
america
is
the
best
place
after
all
and
of
america
boston
is
the
hub
you
know
bertram
reminded
her
it
is
nodded
billy
and
it
has
changed
a
mite
except
to
grow
better
you
see
as
if
i
had
been
counting
the
days
she
exulted
and
now
what
have
you
been
doing
all
of
you
just
wait
till
you
see
laughed
bertram
they
all
spread
out
for
your
a
new
of
a
girl
of
course
yards
of
them
and
heaps
of
blues
and
basalts
she
questioned
turning
to
william
well
a
few
hesitated
william
modestly
and
the
music
what
of
that
billy
looked
now
at
cyril
you
see
he
shrugged
there
very
little
after
all
of
billy
gave
a
wise
shake
of
her
head
i
know
better
and
i
want
to
see
it
all
so
much
we
talked
and
talked
of
it
have
we
aunt
hannah
of
what
we
would
do
when
we
got
to
boston
yes
my
dear
you
the
girl
laughed
i
accept
the
amendment
she
retorted
with
mock
submission
i
suppose
it
is
always
i
who
it
was
when
i
painted
you
teased
bertram
by
the
way
i
let
you
talk
if
you
pose
again
for
me
he
finished
eagerly
billy
uptilted
her
nose
do
you
think
sir
you
deserve
it
after
that
speech
she
demanded
but
how
about
your
art
your
music
entreated
william
you
have
said
so
little
of
that
in
your
billy
hesitated
for
a
brief
moment
she
glanced
at
cyril
he
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
his
brother
question
he
was
talking
with
aunt
hannah
oh
i
play
some
murmured
the
girl
almost
evasively
but
tell
me
of
yourself
uncle
william
and
of
what
you
are
and
william
needed
no
second
bidding
it
was
some
time
later
that
billy
turned
to
him
with
an
amazed
exclamation
in
response
to
something
he
had
said
home
with
you
why
uncle
william
what
do
you
mean
you
did
really
think
you
got
to
be
troubled
with
me
any
longer
she
cried
merrily
william
face
paled
then
flushed
i
did
not
call
it
billy
he
said
quietly
his
grieved
eyes
looked
straight
into
hers
and
drove
the
merriment
quite
away
oh
i
so
sorry
she
said
gently
and
i
appreciate
your
kindness
indeed
i
do
but
i
could
really
i
could
think
of
such
a
thing
and
you
do
have
to
think
of
it
cut
in
bertram
who
considered
that
the
situation
was
becoming
much
too
serious
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
billy
shook
her
head
you
are
so
good
all
of
you
but
you
did
you
really
did
think
i
was
coming
she
protested
indeed
we
did
asserted
bertram
promptly
and
we
have
done
everything
to
get
ready
for
you
too
even
to
rigging
up
spunkie
to
masquerade
as
spunk
i
warrant
that
pete
nose
is
already
flattened
against
the
lest
we
should
happen
to
come
and
there
no
telling
how
many
cakes
of
chocolate
dong
ling
has
spoiled
by
this
time
we
left
him
trying
to
make
fudge
you
billy
laughed
but
she
cried
too
at
least
her
eyes
grew
suddenly
moist
bertram
tried
to
decide
afterward
whether
she
laughed
till
she
cried
or
cried
till
she
laughed
no
no
she
demurred
tremulously
i
could
i
really
have
never
intended
but
why
not
what
are
you
going
to
do
questioned
william
in
a
voice
that
was
dazed
and
hurt
the
first
question
billy
ignored
the
second
she
answered
with
a
promptness
and
a
gayety
that
was
meant
to
turn
the
thoughts
away
from
the
first
we
are
going
to
boston
aunt
hannah
and
i
we
got
rooms
engaged
for
just
now
but
later
we
going
to
take
a
house
and
live
together
that
what
we
going
to
chapter
xxii
hugh
calderwell
in
the
beacon
street
house
william
mournfully
removed
the
huge
pink
bow
from
spunkie
neck
and
bertram
threw
away
the
roses
cyril
marched
with
his
pile
of
new
music
and
his
book
and
pete
in
obedience
to
orders
hid
the
workbasket
the
tea
table
and
the
low
with
a
great
display
of
a
getting
back
home
air
bertram
moved
many
of
his
belongings
upstairs
but
inside
of
a
week
he
had
moved
them
down
again
saying
that
after
all
he
believed
he
liked
the
first
floor
better
billy
rooms
were
closed
then
and
remained
as
they
had
for
years
silent
and
deserted
billy
with
aunt
hannah
had
gone
directly
to
their
back
bay
hotel
this
is
for
just
while
i
the
girl
had
said
but
very
soon
she
had
decided
to
go
to
hampden
falls
for
the
summer
and
postpone
her
until
the
autumn
billy
was
now
and
there
were
many
matters
of
business
to
arrange
with
lawyer
harding
concerning
her
inheritance
it
was
not
until
september
therefore
when
billy
once
more
returned
to
boston
that
the
henshaw
brothers
had
the
opportunity
of
renewing
their
acquaintance
with
william
namesake
i
want
a
home
billy
said
to
bertram
and
william
on
the
night
of
her
arrival
as
before
stetson
and
billy
had
gone
directly
to
a
hotel
i
want
a
real
home
with
a
furnace
to
shake
if
i
want
to
and
some
dirt
to
dig
well
i
sure
that
ought
to
be
easy
to
find
smiled
bertram
oh
but
that
is
all
supplemented
billy
it
must
be
mostly
closets
and
piazza
at
least
those
are
the
important
well
you
might
run
across
a
snag
there
why
do
you
build
billy
gave
a
gesture
of
dissent
too
slow
i
want
it
bertram
laughed
his
eyes
narrowed
quizzically
from
what
calderwell
says
he
bantered
i
should
judge
that
there
are
plenty
of
sighing
swains
who
are
only
too
ready
to
give
you
a
home
and
the
pink
deepened
in
billy
cheeks
i
said
closets
and
a
piazza
dirt
to
dig
and
a
furnace
to
shake
she
retorted
merrily
i
did
say
i
wanted
a
and
you
do
of
course
interposed
william
decidedly
you
are
much
too
young
for
yes
sir
agreed
billy
demurely
but
bertram
was
sure
he
saw
a
twinkle
under
the
downcast
lashes
and
where
is
cyril
asked
stetson
coming
into
the
room
at
that
moment
william
stirred
restlessly
well
cyril
could
could
come
stammered
william
with
an
uneasy
glance
at
his
brother
billy
laughed
unexpectedly
it
too
bad
about
cyril
not
coming
she
murmured
and
again
bertram
caught
the
twinkle
in
the
downcast
eyes
to
bertram
the
twinkle
looked
interesting
and
worth
pursuit
but
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
chase
calderwell
card
came
up
and
that
ended
everything
so
bertram
declared
crossly
to
himself
billy
found
her
dirt
to
dig
in
and
her
furnace
to
shake
in
brookline
there
were
closets
too
and
a
generous
expanse
of
veranda
they
all
belonged
to
a
quaint
little
house
perched
on
the
side
of
corey
hill
from
the
veranda
in
the
rear
and
from
many
of
the
windows
one
looked
out
upon
a
delightful
view
of
roofs
nestling
among
towering
trees
with
the
wide
sweep
of
the
sky
above
and
the
haze
of
faraway
hills
at
the
horizon
in
fact
it
as
nearly
perfect
as
it
can
be
and
not
take
and
fly
away
declared
billy
i
have
named
it
very
early
in
her
career
as
billy
decided
that
however
delightful
it
might
be
to
have
a
furnace
to
shake
it
would
not
be
at
all
delightful
to
shake
it
besides
there
was
the
new
motor
car
to
run
billy
therefore
sought
and
found
a
good
strong
man
who
had
not
only
the
muscle
and
the
willingness
to
shake
the
furnace
but
the
skill
to
turn
chauffeur
at
a
moment
notice
best
of
all
this
man
had
also
a
wife
who
with
a
maid
to
assist
her
would
take
full
charge
of
the
house
and
thus
leave
billy
and
stetson
free
from
care
all
these
together
with
a
canary
and
a
kitten
as
near
like
spunk
as
could
be
obtained
made
billy
household
and
now
i
ready
to
see
my
friends
she
announced
and
i
think
your
friends
will
be
ready
to
see
you
bertram
assured
her
and
they
were
at
least
so
it
appeared
for
at
once
the
little
house
perched
on
the
hillside
became
the
mecca
for
many
of
the
friends
who
had
known
billy
as
william
merry
namesake
there
were
others
too
whom
billy
had
met
abroad
and
there
were
old
women
and
an
occasional
old
man
aunt
hannah
friends
who
found
that
the
young
mistress
of
hillside
was
a
charming
hostess
there
were
also
the
henshaw
boys
and
there
was
always
calderwell
at
least
so
bertram
declared
to
himself
sometimes
bertram
came
frequently
to
the
little
house
on
the
hill
even
more
frequently
than
william
but
cyril
was
not
seen
there
so
often
he
came
once
at
first
it
is
true
and
followed
billy
from
room
to
room
as
she
proudly
displayed
her
new
home
he
showed
polite
interest
in
her
view
and
a
perfunctory
enjoyment
of
the
tea
she
prepared
for
him
but
he
did
not
come
again
for
some
time
and
when
he
did
come
he
sat
stiffly
silent
while
his
brothers
did
most
of
the
talking
as
to
calderwell
calderwell
seemed
suddenly
to
have
lost
his
interest
in
impenetrable
forests
and
unclimbable
mountains
nothing
more
intricate
than
the
long
beacon
street
boulevard
or
more
inaccessible
than
corey
hill
seemed
worth
exploring
apparently
according
to
calderwell
own
version
of
it
he
had
settled
down
he
was
going
to
be
something
that
was
and
he
did
spend
sundry
of
his
morning
hours
in
a
boston
law
office
with
ponderous
volumes
spread
in
imposing
array
on
the
desk
before
him
other
hours
many
hours
he
spent
with
billy
one
day
very
soon
in
fact
after
she
arrived
in
boston
billy
asked
calderwell
about
the
henshaws
tell
me
about
them
she
said
tell
me
what
they
have
been
doing
all
these
tell
you
about
them
why
do
you
know
she
shook
her
head
no
cyril
says
nothing
william
little
more
about
themselves
and
you
know
what
bertram
is
one
can
hardly
separate
sense
from
nonsense
with
you
do
know
then
how
splendidly
bertram
has
done
with
his
art
no
only
from
the
most
casual
hearsay
has
he
done
well
then
finely
the
public
has
been
his
for
years
and
now
the
critics
are
tumbling
over
each
other
to
do
him
honor
they
rave
about
his
brilliant
nervous
touch
whatever
that
may
be
his
color
sense
his
of
line
and
pose
and
they
quarrel
over
whether
it
realism
or
idealism
that
constitutes
his
i
so
glad
and
is
it
still
the
of
a
girl
yes
only
he
doing
straight
portraiture
now
as
well
it
got
to
be
quite
the
thing
to
be
by
henshaw
and
there
many
a
fair
lady
that
has
graciously
commissioned
him
to
paint
her
portrait
he
a
fine
fellow
too
a
mighty
fine
fellow
you
may
not
know
perhaps
but
three
or
four
years
ago
he
was
well
not
wild
but
he
would
probably
have
called
it
he
got
in
with
a
lot
of
fellows
that
well
that
were
good
for
a
chap
of
bertram
like
seaver
calderwell
turned
sharply
did
you
know
seaver
he
demanded
in
obvious
surprise
i
used
to
see
him
with
oh
well
he
was
one
of
them
unfortunately
but
bertram
shipped
him
years
billy
gave
a
sudden
radiant
smile
but
she
changed
the
subject
at
once
and
william
still
collects
i
suppose
she
observed
jove
i
should
say
he
did
i
forgotten
the
latest
but
he
a
fine
fellow
too
like
and
cyril
calderwell
frowned
that
chap
a
poser
for
me
billy
and
no
mistake
i
ca
make
him
out
what
the
matter
i
do
know
probably
i
not
to
his
pitch
bertram
told
me
once
that
cyril
was
very
sensitively
strung
and
never
responded
until
a
certain
note
was
struck
well
i
have
ever
found
that
note
i
billy
laughed
i
never
heard
bertram
say
that
but
i
think
i
know
what
he
means
and
he
right
too
i
begin
to
realize
now
what
a
jangling
discord
i
must
have
created
when
i
tried
to
harmonize
with
him
three
years
ago
but
what
is
he
doing
in
his
music
the
other
shrugged
his
shoulders
same
thing
plays
occasionally
and
plays
well
too
but
he
so
erratic
it
difficult
to
get
him
to
do
it
everything
must
be
just
so
you
know
air
light
piano
and
audience
he
got
another
book
out
i
told
a
profound
treatise
on
somebody
something
or
other
musical
of
and
he
used
to
write
music
does
he
do
that
any
more
i
believe
so
i
hear
of
it
occasionally
through
musical
friends
of
mine
they
even
play
it
to
me
sometimes
but
i
ca
stand
for
much
of
it
his
stuff
really
indeed
and
why
not
an
odd
hostility
showed
in
billy
eyes
again
calderwell
shrugged
his
shoulders
do
ask
me
i
do
know
but
they
always
dead
slow
somber
things
with
the
wail
of
a
lost
spirit
shrieking
through
but
i
just
love
lost
spirits
that
wail
avowed
billy
with
more
than
a
shade
of
reproach
in
her
voice
calderwell
stared
then
he
shook
his
head
not
in
mine
thank
you
he
retorted
whimsically
i
prefer
my
spirits
of
a
more
sane
and
cheerful
the
girl
laughed
but
almost
instantly
she
fell
silent
i
been
wondering
she
began
musingly
after
a
time
why
some
one
of
those
three
men
does
not
you
would
wonder
if
you
knew
them
better
declared
calderwell
now
think
let
begin
at
the
top
of
the
strata
by
the
way
name
for
that
establishment
is
mighty
clever
first
cyril
according
to
bertram
cyril
hates
kinds
of
women
and
other
confusion
and
i
fancy
bertram
hits
it
about
right
so
that
settles
cyril
then
william
you
know
william
any
girl
would
say
william
was
a
dear
but
william
is
a
marrying
man
dad
says
calderwell
voice
softened
a
little
dad
says
that
william
and
his
young
wife
were
the
most
devoted
couple
that
he
ever
saw
and
that
when
she
died
she
seemed
to
take
with
her
the
whole
of
william
heart
that
is
what
had
gone
with
the
baby
a
few
years
before
there
was
a
boy
you
know
that
yes
i
know
nodded
billy
quick
tears
in
her
eyes
aunt
hannah
told
well
that
counts
out
william
then
said
calderwell
with
an
air
of
finality
but
how
about
bertram
you
have
settled
bertram
laughed
billy
archly
bertram
calderwell
eyes
widened
billy
can
you
imagine
making
love
in
real
earnest
to
a
girl
why
i
do
know
maybe
billy
tipped
her
head
from
side
to
side
as
if
she
were
viewing
a
picture
set
up
for
her
inspection
well
i
ca
in
the
first
place
no
girl
would
think
he
was
serious
or
if
by
any
chance
she
did
she
soon
discover
that
it
was
the
turn
of
her
head
or
the
tilt
of
her
chin
that
he
admired
to
paint
now
that
so
billy
laughed
but
she
did
not
answer
it
is
and
you
know
it
declared
calderwell
and
that
settles
him
now
you
can
see
perhaps
why
none
of
these
men
will
it
was
a
long
minute
before
billy
spoke
not
a
bit
of
it
i
do
see
it
at
all
she
declared
with
roguish
merriment
moreover
i
think
that
some
day
some
one
of
them
will
marry
sir
doubtful
calderwell
threw
a
quick
glance
into
her
eyes
evidently
something
he
saw
there
sent
a
swift
shadow
to
his
own
he
waited
a
moment
then
asked
abruptly
billy
wo
you
marry
me
billy
frowned
though
her
eyes
still
laughed
hugh
i
told
you
not
to
ask
me
that
again
she
demurred
and
i
told
you
not
to
ask
impossibilities
of
me
he
retorted
imperturbably
billy
wo
you
now
seriously
seriously
no
hugh
please
do
let
us
go
all
over
that
again
when
we
done
it
so
many
no
let
do
agreed
the
man
cheerfully
and
we
do
have
to
either
if
you
only
say
now
right
away
without
any
more
billy
sighed
impatiently
hugh
wo
you
understand
that
i
serious
she
cried
then
she
turned
suddenly
with
a
peculiar
flash
in
her
eyes
hugh
i
do
believe
bertram
himself
could
make
love
any
more
nonsensically
than
you
can
calderwell
laughed
but
he
frowned
too
and
again
he
threw
into
billy
face
that
keenly
questioning
glance
he
said
something
a
light
something
that
brought
the
laugh
to
billy
lips
in
spite
of
herself
but
he
was
still
frowning
when
he
left
the
house
some
minutes
later
and
the
shadow
was
not
gone
from
his
eyes
chapter
xxiii
bertram
does
some
questioning
billy
time
was
well
occupied
there
were
so
many
many
things
she
wished
to
do
and
so
few
few
hours
in
which
to
do
them
first
there
was
her
music
she
made
arrangements
at
once
to
study
with
one
of
best
piano
teachers
and
she
also
made
plans
to
continue
her
french
and
german
she
joined
a
musical
club
a
literary
club
and
a
more
strictly
social
club
and
to
numerous
church
charities
and
philanthropic
enterprises
she
lent
more
than
her
name
giving
freely
of
both
time
and
money
friday
afternoons
of
course
were
to
be
held
sacred
to
the
symphony
concerts
and
on
certain
wednesday
mornings
there
was
to
be
a
series
of
recitals
in
which
she
was
greatly
interested
for
society
with
a
capital
s
billy
cared
little
but
for
sociability
with
a
small
s
she
cared
much
and
very
wide
she
opened
her
doors
to
her
friends
lavishing
upon
them
a
wealth
of
hospitality
nor
did
they
all
come
in
carriages
or
automobiles
these
friends
a
certain
little
widow
over
at
the
south
end
knew
just
how
good
miss
neilson
tea
tasted
on
a
crisp
october
afternoon
and
marie
hawthorn
a
frail
young
woman
who
gave
music
lessons
knew
just
how
restful
was
miss
neilson
couch
after
a
weary
day
of
long
walks
and
fretful
pupils
but
how
in
the
world
do
you
discover
them
all
these
forlorn
specimens
of
humanity
queried
bertram
one
evening
when
he
had
found
billy
entertaining
a
with
a
plate
of
ice
cream
and
a
big
square
of
cake
anywhere
everywhere
smiled
billy
well
this
last
candidate
for
your
favor
who
has
just
gone
who
he
i
do
know
beyond
that
his
name
is
and
that
he
likes
ice
and
you
never
saw
him
before
humph
one
would
think
it
to
see
his
charming
air
of
nonchalant
oh
but
it
does
take
much
to
make
a
little
fellow
like
that
feel
at
home
laughed
billy
and
are
you
in
the
habit
of
feeding
every
one
who
comes
to
your
house
on
ice
cream
and
chocolate
cake
i
thought
that
stone
doorstep
of
yours
was
looking
a
little
not
a
bit
of
it
retorted
billy
this
little
chap
came
with
a
message
just
as
i
was
finishing
dinner
the
ice
cream
was
particularly
good
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
like
a
taste
so
i
gave
it
to
bertram
raised
his
eyebrows
quizzically
very
kind
of
course
but
why
ice
cream
he
questioned
i
thought
it
was
roast
beef
and
boiled
potatoes
that
was
supposed
to
be
handed
out
to
it
is
nodded
billy
and
that
why
i
think
sometimes
they
like
ice
cream
and
chocolate
frosting
besides
to
give
sugar
plums
one
have
to
unwind
yards
of
red
tape
or
worry
about
the
poor
to
give
red
flannels
and
a
ton
of
coal
one
must
be
properly
circumspect
and
consult
records
and
city
missionaries
of
course
and
that
why
it
such
a
relief
sometimes
just
to
hand
over
a
simple
little
sugar
plum
and
see
them
for
a
minute
bertram
was
silent
then
he
asked
abruptly
billy
why
did
you
leave
the
strata
billy
was
taken
quite
by
surprise
a
pink
flush
spread
to
her
forehead
and
her
tongue
stumbled
at
first
over
her
reply
why
i
it
seemed
you
why
i
left
to
go
to
hampden
falls
to
be
sure
do
you
remember
she
finished
gaily
oh
yes
i
remember
that
conceded
bertram
with
disdainful
emphasis
but
why
did
you
go
to
hampden
falls
why
it
it
was
the
only
place
to
go
that
is
i
wanted
to
go
there
she
corrected
hastily
did
aunt
hannah
tell
you
that
i
i
was
homesick
to
get
back
there
oh
yes
aunt
hannah
said
that
observed
the
man
but
was
that
homesickness
a
little
sudden
billy
blushed
pink
again
why
maybe
but
well
homesickness
is
always
more
or
less
sudden
is
it
she
parried
bertram
laughed
but
his
eyes
grew
suddenly
almost
tender
see
here
billy
you
ca
bluff
worth
a
cent
he
declared
you
are
much
too
refreshingly
frank
for
that
something
was
the
trouble
now
what
was
it
wo
you
tell
me
please
billy
pouted
she
hesitated
and
gazed
anywhere
but
into
the
challenging
eyes
before
her
then
very
suddenly
she
looked
straight
into
them
very
well
there
was
a
reason
for
my
leaving
she
confessed
a
little
breathlessly
i
did
want
to
bother
you
any
more
all
of
bother
us
no
i
found
out
you
could
paint
cyril
could
play
or
write
and
and
everything
was
different
because
i
was
there
but
i
blame
you
no
no
she
assured
him
hastily
it
was
only
that
i
found
and
may
i
ask
how
you
obtained
this
most
extraordinary
information
demanded
bertram
savagely
billy
shook
her
head
her
round
little
chin
looked
suddenly
square
and
determined
you
may
ask
but
i
shall
not
tell
she
declared
firmly
if
bertram
had
known
billy
just
a
little
better
he
would
have
let
the
matter
drop
there
but
he
did
not
know
billy
so
he
asked
was
it
anything
i
did
or
said
the
girl
did
not
answer
billy
was
it
bertram
voice
showed
terror
now
billy
laughed
unexpectedly
do
you
think
i
going
to
say
to
a
series
of
questions
and
then
give
the
whole
thing
away
by
my
silence
when
you
come
to
the
right
one
she
demanded
merrily
no
sir
well
anyhow
it
was
i
then
sighed
the
man
in
relief
for
you
just
observed
that
you
were
not
going
to
say
to
a
series
of
questions
and
that
was
the
first
one
so
i
found
out
that
much
anyhow
he
concluded
triumphantly
the
girl
eyed
him
for
a
moment
in
silence
then
she
shook
her
head
i
not
going
to
be
caught
that
way
either
she
smiled
you
know
just
what
you
did
in
the
first
place
about
it
the
man
stirred
restlessly
and
pondered
after
a
long
pause
he
adopted
new
tactics
with
a
searching
study
of
her
face
to
note
the
slightest
change
he
enumerated
was
it
cyril
then
will
aunt
hannah
kate
it
could
have
been
pete
or
dong
ling
billy
still
smiled
inscrutably
at
no
name
had
bertram
detected
so
much
as
the
flicker
of
an
eyelid
and
with
a
glance
he
fell
back
into
his
chair
i
give
it
up
you
won
he
acknowledged
but
billy
his
manner
changed
suddenly
i
wonder
if
you
know
just
what
a
hole
you
left
in
the
strata
when
you
went
but
i
could
have
in
the
whole
strata
objected
billy
i
occupied
only
one
stratum
and
a
stratum
does
go
up
and
down
you
know
only
across
and
mine
was
the
second
bertram
gave
a
slow
shake
of
his
head
i
know
but
yours
was
a
freak
formation
he
maintained
gravely
it
did
go
up
and
down
honestly
billy
we
did
care
lots
will
and
i
were
inconsolable
and
even
cyril
played
dirges
for
a
did
he
gurgled
billy
with
sudden
joyousness
i
so
glad
thank
you
murmured
bertram
disapprovingly
we
had
considered
it
a
subject
for
what
oh
i
did
mean
that
that
is
she
stopped
helplessly
oh
never
mind
about
trying
to
explain
interposed
bertram
i
fancy
the
remedy
would
be
worse
than
the
disease
in
this
nonsense
i
only
meant
that
i
like
to
be
missed
sometimes
retorted
billy
a
little
nettled
and
you
rejoice
then
to
have
me
mope
cyril
play
dirges
and
will
wander
mournfully
about
the
house
with
spunkie
in
his
arms
you
should
have
seen
william
if
his
forlornness
did
not
bring
tears
to
your
eyes
the
grace
of
the
pink
bow
that
lopped
behind
spunkie
left
ear
would
surely
have
brought
a
copious
billy
laughed
but
her
eyes
grew
tender
did
uncle
william
do
that
she
asked
he
did
and
he
did
more
pete
told
me
after
a
time
that
you
had
not
left
one
thing
in
the
house
anywhere
but
one
day
over
behind
william
most
treasured
lowestoft
i
found
a
small
shell
hairpin
and
a
flat
brown
silk
button
that
i
recognized
as
coming
from
one
of
your
oh
said
billy
softly
dear
uncle
william
and
how
good
he
was
to
me
chapter
xxiv
cyril
the
enigma
perhaps
it
was
because
billy
saw
so
little
of
cyril
that
it
was
cyril
whom
she
wished
particularly
to
see
william
bertram
calderwell
all
her
other
friends
came
frequently
to
the
little
house
on
the
hill
billy
told
herself
only
cyril
held
aloof
and
it
was
cyril
that
she
wanted
billy
said
that
it
was
his
music
that
she
wanted
to
hear
him
play
and
that
she
wanted
him
to
hear
her
she
felt
grieved
and
chagrined
not
once
since
she
had
come
had
he
seemed
interested
really
interested
in
her
music
he
had
asked
her
it
is
true
in
a
perfunctory
way
what
she
had
done
and
who
her
teachers
had
been
but
all
the
while
she
was
answering
she
had
felt
that
he
was
not
listening
that
he
did
not
care
and
she
cared
so
much
she
knew
now
that
all
her
practising
through
the
long
hard
months
of
study
had
been
for
cyril
every
scale
had
been
smoothed
for
his
ears
and
every
phrase
had
been
interpreted
with
his
approbation
in
view
across
the
wide
waste
of
waters
his
face
had
shone
like
a
star
of
promise
beckoning
her
on
and
on
to
heights
unknown
and
now
she
was
here
in
boston
but
she
could
not
even
play
the
scale
nor
interpret
the
phrase
for
the
ear
to
which
they
had
been
so
laboriously
attuned
and
cyril
face
in
the
flesh
was
no
beckoning
star
of
promise
but
was
a
thing
as
cold
and
relentless
as
was
the
waste
of
waters
across
which
it
had
shone
in
the
past
billy
did
not
understand
it
she
knew
it
is
true
of
cyril
reputed
aversion
to
women
in
general
and
to
noise
but
she
was
neither
women
in
general
nor
noise
she
told
herself
indignantly
she
was
only
the
little
maid
grown
three
years
older
who
had
sat
at
his
feet
and
adoringly
listened
to
all
that
he
had
been
pleased
to
say
in
the
old
days
at
the
top
of
the
strata
and
he
had
been
kind
then
very
kind
billy
declared
stoutly
he
had
been
patient
and
interested
too
and
he
had
seemed
not
only
willing
but
glad
to
teach
her
while
now
sometimes
billy
thought
she
would
ask
him
candidly
what
was
the
matter
but
it
was
always
the
old
frank
billy
that
thought
this
the
impulsive
billy
that
had
gone
up
to
cyril
rooms
years
before
and
cheerfully
announced
that
she
had
come
to
get
acquainted
it
was
never
the
sensible
circumspect
billy
that
aunt
hannah
had
for
three
years
been
shaping
and
coaxing
into
being
but
even
this
billy
frowned
rebelliously
and
declared
that
sometime
something
should
be
said
that
would
at
least
give
him
a
chance
to
explain
in
all
the
weeks
since
billy
purchase
of
hillside
cyril
had
been
there
only
twice
and
it
was
nearly
thanksgiving
now
billy
had
seen
him
once
or
twice
also
at
the
beacon
street
house
when
she
and
aunt
hannah
had
dined
there
but
on
all
these
occasions
he
had
been
either
the
coldly
reserved
guest
or
the
painfully
punctilious
host
never
had
he
been
in
the
least
approachable
he
treats
me
exactly
as
he
treated
poor
little
spunk
that
first
night
billy
declared
hotly
to
herself
only
once
since
she
came
had
billy
heard
cyril
play
and
that
was
when
she
had
shared
the
privilege
with
hundreds
of
others
at
a
public
concert
she
had
sat
then
entranced
with
her
eyes
on
the
handsome
profile
of
the
man
who
played
with
so
sure
a
skill
and
power
yet
without
a
note
before
him
afterward
she
had
met
him
face
to
face
and
had
tried
to
tell
him
how
moved
she
was
but
in
her
agitation
and
because
of
a
strange
shyness
that
had
suddenly
come
to
her
she
had
ended
only
in
stammering
out
some
flippant
banality
that
had
brought
to
his
face
merely
a
bored
smile
of
acknowledgment
twice
she
had
asked
him
to
play
for
her
but
each
time
he
had
begged
to
be
excused
courteously
but
decidedly
it
no
use
to
tease
bertram
had
interposed
once
with
an
airy
wave
of
his
hands
this
lion
always
did
refuse
to
roar
to
order
if
you
really
must
hear
him
you
have
to
slip
and
camp
outside
his
door
waiting
patiently
for
such
crumbs
as
may
fall
from
his
are
your
metaphors
a
little
mixed
questioned
cyril
irritably
yes
sir
acknowledged
bertram
with
unruffled
temper
but
i
mind
if
billy
does
i
only
meant
her
to
understand
that
she
have
to
do
as
she
used
to
do
listen
outside
your
billy
cheeks
reddened
but
that
is
what
i
do
she
retorted
with
spirit
and
moreover
i
still
have
hopes
that
some
day
he
play
to
maybe
conceded
bertram
doubtfully
if
the
stool
and
the
piano
and
the
pedals
and
the
weather
and
his
fingers
and
your
ears
and
my
watch
are
all
just
right
then
he
nonsense
scowled
cyril
i
play
of
course
some
day
but
rather
not
and
there
the
matter
had
ended
since
then
billy
had
not
asked
him
to
play
chapter
xxv
the
old
room
and
billy
thanksgiving
was
to
be
a
great
day
in
the
henshaw
family
the
henshaw
brothers
were
to
entertain
billy
and
aunt
hannah
had
been
invited
to
dinner
and
so
joyously
hospitable
was
william
invitation
that
it
would
have
included
the
new
kitten
and
the
canary
if
billy
would
have
consented
to
bring
them
once
more
pete
swept
and
garnished
the
house
and
once
more
dong
ling
spoiled
uncounted
squares
of
chocolate
trying
to
make
the
baffling
fudge
bertram
said
that
the
entire
strata
was
not
but
that
billy
and
aunt
hannah
had
visited
there
before
but
that
this
was
different
they
were
to
come
at
noon
this
time
this
visit
was
not
to
be
a
tantalizing
little
piece
of
stiffness
an
hour
and
a
half
long
it
was
to
be
a
satisfying
matter
of
half
a
day
comradeship
almost
like
old
times
so
once
more
the
roses
graced
the
rooms
and
a
flaring
pink
bow
adorned
spunkie
fat
neck
and
once
more
bertram
placed
his
latest
face
of
a
girl
in
the
best
possible
light
there
was
still
a
difference
however
for
this
time
cyril
did
not
bring
any
music
down
to
the
piano
nor
display
anywhere
a
copy
of
his
newest
book
the
dinner
was
to
be
at
three
but
by
special
invitation
the
guests
were
to
arrive
at
twelve
and
promptly
at
the
appointed
hour
they
came
there
this
is
something
like
exulted
bertram
when
the
ladies
divested
of
their
wraps
toasted
their
feet
before
the
open
fire
in
his
den
indeed
it
is
for
now
i
time
to
see
everything
everything
done
since
i
been
gone
cried
billy
gazing
eagerly
about
her
well
that
was
what
i
meant
shrugged
bertram
of
course
not
but
it
what
i
meant
retorted
billy
and
there
are
other
things
too
i
expect
there
are
half
a
dozen
new
blues
and
black
basalts
that
i
want
to
see
eh
uncle
william
she
finished
smiling
into
the
eyes
of
the
man
who
had
been
gazing
at
her
with
doting
pride
for
the
last
five
minutes
ho
will
is
on
teapots
now
quoth
bertram
before
his
brother
had
a
chance
to
reply
you
might
dangle
the
oldest
blue
that
ever
was
before
him
now
and
he
pay
scant
attention
if
he
happened
at
the
same
time
to
get
his
eyes
on
some
old
pewter
chain
with
a
green
stone
in
billy
laughed
but
at
the
look
of
genuine
distress
that
came
into
william
face
she
sobered
at
once
do
you
let
him
tease
you
uncle
william
she
said
quickly
i
sure
pewter
chains
with
green
stones
in
them
sound
just
awfully
interesting
and
i
want
to
see
them
right
away
now
come
she
finished
springing
to
her
feet
take
me
please
and
show
them
to
william
shook
his
head
and
said
no
no
protesting
that
what
he
had
were
scarcely
worth
her
attention
but
even
while
he
talked
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
advanced
half
eagerly
half
reluctantly
toward
the
door
nonsense
said
billy
fondly
as
she
laid
her
hand
on
his
arm
i
know
they
are
very
much
worth
seeing
come
and
she
led
the
way
from
the
room
oh
oh
she
exclaimed
a
few
moments
later
as
she
stood
before
a
small
cabinet
in
one
of
william
rooms
oh
oh
how
pretty
do
you
like
them
i
thought
you
would
triumphed
william
quick
joy
driving
away
the
anxious
fear
in
his
eyes
you
see
i
i
thought
of
you
when
i
got
them
every
one
of
them
i
thought
you
like
them
but
i
have
very
many
yet
of
course
this
is
the
latest
and
he
tenderly
lifted
from
its
black
velvet
mat
a
curious
silver
necklace
made
of
small
flat
disks
heavily
chased
and
set
at
regular
intervals
with
a
strange
stone
billy
hung
above
it
enraptured
oh
what
a
beauty
and
this
i
suppose
is
bertram
chain
indeed
she
scoffed
tell
me
uncle
william
where
did
you
get
it
and
uncle
william
told
happily
thirstily
drinking
in
billy
evident
interest
with
delight
there
were
too
a
ring
and
a
brooch
and
to
each
belonged
a
story
which
william
was
equally
glad
to
tell
there
were
other
treasures
also
buckles
rings
brooches
and
necklaces
some
of
dull
gold
some
of
equally
dull
silver
but
all
of
odd
design
and
curious
workmanship
studded
here
and
there
with
bits
of
red
green
yellow
blue
and
stones
very
learnedly
then
from
william
lips
fell
the
new
vocabulary
that
had
come
to
him
with
his
latest
treasures
chrysoprase
carnelian
girasol
onyx
plasma
sardonyx
lapis
lazuli
tourmaline
chrysolite
hyacinth
and
carbuncle
they
are
lovely
perfectly
lovely
breathed
billy
when
the
last
chain
had
slipped
through
her
fingers
into
william
hand
i
think
they
are
the
very
nicest
things
you
ever
so
do
i
agreed
the
man
emphatically
and
they
are
different
they
are
said
billy
very
but
she
was
not
looking
at
the
jewelry
her
eyes
were
on
a
small
shell
hairpin
and
a
brown
silk
button
half
hidden
behind
a
lowestoft
teapot
on
the
way
william
stopped
a
moment
at
billy
old
rooms
i
wish
you
were
here
now
he
said
wistfully
they
all
ready
for
you
these
oh
but
why
do
you
use
them
such
pretty
rooms
cried
billy
quickly
william
gave
a
gesture
of
dissent
we
have
no
use
for
them
besides
they
belong
to
you
and
aunt
hannah
you
left
your
imprint
long
ago
my
dear
we
should
not
feel
at
home
in
oh
but
you
should
you
must
feel
like
that
objected
billy
hurriedly
crossing
the
room
to
the
window
to
hide
a
sudden
nervousness
that
had
assailed
her
and
here
my
piano
too
and
open
she
finished
gaily
dropping
herself
upon
the
piano
stool
and
dashing
into
a
brilliant
mazourka
billy
like
cyril
had
a
way
of
working
off
her
moods
at
her
finger
tips
and
the
tripping
notes
and
crashing
chords
told
of
a
nervous
excitement
that
was
not
all
joy
from
the
doorway
william
watched
her
flying
fingers
with
fond
pride
and
it
was
very
reluctantly
that
he
acceded
to
pete
request
to
go
for
a
moment
to
settle
a
vexed
question
concerning
the
table
decorations
billy
left
alone
still
played
but
with
a
difference
the
tripping
notes
slowed
into
a
weird
melody
that
rose
and
fell
and
lost
itself
in
the
exquisite
harmony
that
had
been
born
of
the
crashing
chords
billy
was
improvising
now
and
into
her
music
had
crept
something
of
her
longing
when
she
had
come
to
that
house
a
lonely
orphan
girl
in
search
of
a
home
on
and
on
she
played
then
with
a
discordant
note
she
suddenly
rose
from
the
piano
she
was
thinking
of
kate
and
wondering
if
had
kate
not
managed
the
little
room
would
still
be
home
so
swiftly
did
billy
cross
to
the
door
that
the
man
on
the
stairs
outside
had
not
time
to
get
quite
out
of
sight
billy
did
not
see
his
face
however
she
saw
only
a
pair
of
legs
disappearing
around
the
curve
of
the
landing
above
she
thought
nothing
of
it
until
later
when
dinner
was
announced
and
cyril
came
then
she
saw
that
he
and
he
only
that
afternoon
wore
trousers
of
that
particular
shade
of
gray
the
dinner
was
a
great
success
even
the
chocolate
fudge
in
the
little
cut
glass
bonbon
dishes
was
perfect
and
it
was
a
question
whether
pete
or
dong
ling
tried
the
harder
to
please
after
dinner
the
family
gathered
in
the
and
chatted
pleasantly
bertram
displayed
his
prettiest
and
newest
pictures
and
billy
played
and
sung
bright
tuneful
little
things
that
she
knew
aunt
hannah
and
uncle
william
liked
if
cyril
was
pleased
or
displeased
he
did
not
show
it
but
billy
had
ceased
to
play
for
cyril
ears
she
told
herself
that
she
did
not
care
but
she
did
wonder
was
that
cyril
on
the
stairs
and
if
so
what
was
he
doing
there
chapter
xxvi
music
hath
charms
two
days
after
thanksgiving
cyril
called
at
hillside
i
come
to
hear
you
play
he
announced
abruptly
billy
heart
sung
within
her
but
her
temper
rose
did
he
think
then
that
he
had
but
to
beckon
and
she
would
come
and
at
this
late
day
she
asked
herself
aloud
she
said
play
but
this
is
sudden
besides
you
have
heard
the
man
made
a
disdainful
gesture
not
that
i
mean
play
really
play
billy
why
have
you
played
to
me
before
billy
chin
rose
perceptibly
why
have
you
asked
me
she
parried
to
billy
surprise
the
man
answered
this
with
calm
directness
because
calderwell
said
that
you
were
a
dandy
player
and
i
do
care
for
dandy
billy
laughed
now
and
how
do
you
know
i
not
a
dandy
player
sir
impertinent
she
demanded
because
i
heard
you
when
you
thank
you
murmured
billy
cyril
shrugged
his
shoulders
oh
you
know
very
well
what
i
mean
he
defended
i
heard
you
that
when
that
does
billy
was
silent
for
a
moment
her
eyes
gravely
studying
his
face
then
she
asked
were
you
long
on
that
stairway
eh
what
oh
cyril
forehead
grew
suddenly
pink
well
he
finished
a
little
aggressively
oh
nothing
smiled
the
girl
of
course
people
who
live
in
glass
houses
must
not
throw
very
well
then
i
did
listen
acknowledged
the
man
testily
i
liked
what
you
were
playing
i
hoped
later
that
you
play
it
again
but
you
did
i
came
to
hear
again
billy
heart
sung
within
her
but
again
her
temper
rose
too
i
do
think
i
feel
like
it
she
said
sweetly
with
a
shake
of
her
head
not
for
a
brief
moment
cyril
stared
frowningly
then
his
face
lighted
with
his
rare
smile
i
fairly
checkmated
he
said
rising
to
his
feet
and
going
straight
to
the
piano
for
long
minutes
he
played
modulating
from
one
enchanting
composition
to
another
and
finishing
with
the
one
all
chords
with
big
bass
notes
that
marched
on
and
on
the
one
billy
had
sat
long
ago
on
the
stairs
to
hear
there
now
will
you
play
for
me
he
asked
rising
to
his
feet
and
turning
reproachful
eyes
upon
her
billy
too
rose
to
her
feet
her
face
was
flushed
and
her
eyes
were
shining
her
lips
quivered
with
emotion
as
was
always
the
case
music
had
carried
her
quite
out
of
herself
oh
thank
you
thank
you
she
sighed
you
do
know
you
ca
know
how
beautiful
it
all
is
to
me
thank
you
then
surely
now
you
play
to
me
he
returned
a
look
of
real
distress
came
to
billy
face
but
i
ca
not
what
you
heard
the
other
day
she
cried
remorsefully
you
see
i
was
only
cyril
turned
quickly
only
improvising
billy
did
you
ever
write
it
down
any
of
your
improvising
an
embarrassed
red
flew
to
billy
face
not
not
that
amounted
to
well
that
is
some
a
little
she
stammered
let
me
see
no
no
i
could
not
you
again
the
rare
smile
lighted
cyril
eyes
billy
let
me
see
that
paper
very
slowly
the
girl
turned
toward
the
music
cabinet
she
hesitated
glanced
once
more
appealingly
into
cyril
face
then
with
nervous
haste
opened
the
little
mahogany
door
and
took
from
one
of
the
shelves
a
sheet
of
manuscript
music
but
like
a
shy
child
with
her
first
copy
book
she
held
it
half
behind
her
back
as
she
came
toward
the
piano
thank
you
said
cyril
as
he
reached
far
out
for
the
music
the
next
moment
he
seated
himself
again
at
the
piano
twice
he
played
the
little
song
through
carefully
slowly
now
sing
it
he
directed
falteringly
in
a
very
faint
voice
and
with
very
many
breaths
taken
where
they
should
not
have
been
taken
billy
obeyed
when
we
want
to
show
off
your
song
billy
we
wo
ask
you
to
sing
it
observed
the
man
dryly
when
she
had
finished
billy
laughed
and
dimpled
into
a
blush
when
i
want
to
show
off
my
song
i
be
singing
it
to
you
for
the
first
time
she
pouted
cyril
did
not
answer
he
was
playing
over
and
over
certain
harmonies
in
the
music
before
him
i
see
you
studied
your
counterpoint
to
some
purpose
he
vouchsafed
finally
then
where
did
you
get
the
words
the
girl
hesitated
the
flush
had
deepened
on
her
face
well
i
she
stopped
and
gave
an
embarrassed
laugh
i
like
the
small
boy
who
made
the
toys
got
them
all
out
of
my
own
head
and
there
wood
enough
to
make
another
indeed
grunted
the
man
well
have
you
made
any
others
one
or
two
let
me
see
them
i
think
we
had
enough
for
today
she
faltered
i
have
besides
if
i
could
have
a
couple
more
to
go
with
this
it
would
make
a
very
pretty
little
group
of
go
with
this
what
do
you
mean
to
the
publishers
of
the
publishers
certainly
did
you
think
you
were
going
to
keep
these
songs
to
yourself
but
they
are
worth
it
they
ca
be
good
enough
unbelieving
joy
was
in
billy
voice
no
well
we
let
others
decide
that
observed
cyril
with
a
shrug
all
is
if
you
got
any
more
wood
like
this
i
advise
you
to
make
it
up
right
but
i
have
already
cried
the
girl
excitedly
there
are
lots
of
little
things
that
i
that
is
there
are
some
she
corrected
hastily
at
the
look
that
sprang
into
cyril
eyes
oh
there
are
laughed
cyril
well
we
see
what
but
he
did
not
see
he
did
not
even
finish
his
sentence
for
billy
maid
rosa
appeared
just
then
with
a
card
show
calderwell
in
here
said
billy
cyril
said
nothing
aloud
which
was
well
his
thoughts
just
then
were
better
left
unspoken
chapter
xxvii
marie
who
longs
to
make
puddings
wonderful
days
came
then
to
billy
four
songs
it
seemed
had
been
pronounced
by
competent
critics
decidedly
worth
it
unmistakably
good
enough
and
they
were
to
be
brought
out
as
soon
as
possible
of
course
you
understand
explained
cyril
that
there
no
expected
thank
heaven
they
are
that
sort
and
there
no
great
money
in
it
either
you
have
to
write
a
masterpiece
like
my
baby
or
some
such
gem
to
get
the
and
the
money
but
the
songs
are
fine
and
they
take
with
cultured
hearers
we
get
them
introduced
by
good
singers
of
course
and
they
be
favorites
soon
for
the
concert
stage
and
for
billy
saw
a
good
deal
of
cyril
now
already
she
was
at
work
rewriting
and
polishing
some
of
her
melodies
and
cyril
was
helping
her
by
his
interest
as
well
as
by
his
criticism
he
was
in
fact
at
the
house
very
frequently
too
frequently
indeed
to
suit
either
bertram
or
calderwell
even
william
frowned
sometimes
when
his
cozy
chats
with
billy
were
interrupted
by
cyril
appearing
with
a
roll
of
new
music
for
her
to
try
though
william
told
himself
that
he
ought
to
be
thankful
if
there
was
anything
that
could
make
cyril
more
companionable
less
reserved
and
morose
and
cyril
was
different
there
was
no
disputing
that
calderwell
said
that
he
had
come
out
of
his
shell
and
bertram
told
billy
that
she
must
have
found
his
note
and
struck
it
good
and
billy
was
very
happy
to
the
little
music
teacher
marie
hawthorn
she
talked
more
freely
perhaps
than
she
did
to
any
one
else
it
so
wonderful
marie
so
wonderfully
wonderful
she
said
one
day
to
sit
here
in
my
own
room
and
sing
a
little
song
that
comes
from
somewhere
anywhere
out
of
the
sky
itself
then
by
and
by
that
little
song
will
fly
away
away
over
land
and
sea
and
some
day
it
will
touch
somebody
heart
just
as
it
has
touched
mine
oh
marie
is
it
not
wonderful
it
is
dear
and
it
is
not
your
songs
could
not
help
reaching
somebody
heart
there
nothing
wonderful
in
sweet
flatterer
but
i
mean
it
they
are
beautiful
and
so
is
henshaw
yes
it
is
murmured
billy
abstractedly
there
was
a
long
pause
then
marie
asked
with
shy
hesitation
do
you
think
miss
billy
that
he
would
care
i
listened
yesterday
when
he
was
playing
to
you
i
was
up
here
in
your
room
but
when
i
heard
the
music
i
i
went
out
on
the
stairs
and
sat
down
was
it
very
bad
of
me
billy
laughed
happily
if
it
was
he
ca
say
anything
she
reassured
her
he
done
the
same
thing
himself
and
so
have
he
has
done
it
yes
it
was
at
his
home
last
thanksgiving
it
was
then
that
he
found
out
about
my
marie
eyes
were
wistful
and
he
cares
so
much
now
for
your
music
does
he
do
you
think
he
does
demanded
billy
i
know
he
does
and
for
the
one
who
makes
it
nonsense
laughed
billy
with
pinker
cheeks
it
the
music
not
the
musician
that
pleases
him
cyril
does
like
he
does
like
women
no
but
do
look
so
shocked
my
dear
every
one
who
knows
cyril
knows
but
i
do
think
i
believe
it
demurred
marie
gazing
straight
into
billy
eyes
i
sure
i
do
believe
under
the
little
music
teacher
steady
gaze
billy
flushed
again
the
laugh
she
gave
was
an
embarrassed
one
but
through
it
vibrated
a
pleased
ring
nonsense
she
exclaimed
springing
to
her
feet
and
moving
restlessly
about
the
room
with
the
next
breath
she
had
changed
the
subject
to
one
far
removed
from
cyril
and
his
likes
and
dislikes
some
time
later
billy
played
and
it
was
then
that
marie
drew
a
long
sigh
how
beautiful
it
must
be
to
play
like
that
she
breathed
as
if
you
a
music
teacher
could
not
play
laughed
billy
not
like
that
dear
you
know
it
is
not
like
billy
frowned
but
you
are
so
accurate
marie
and
you
can
read
at
sight
so
rapidly
oh
yes
like
a
little
machine
i
know
scorned
the
usually
gentle
marie
bitterly
do
they
have
a
thing
of
metal
that
adds
figures
like
magic
well
i
like
that
i
see
g
and
i
play
g
i
see
d
and
i
play
d
i
see
f
and
i
play
f
and
after
i
seen
enough
g
and
d
and
f
and
played
them
all
the
thing
is
done
i
why
marie
marie
my
dear
the
second
exclamation
was
very
tender
for
marie
was
crying
there
i
knew
i
should
some
day
have
it
out
all
out
sobbed
marie
i
felt
it
then
perhaps
you
you
feel
better
now
stammered
billy
she
tried
to
say
more
other
words
that
would
have
been
a
real
comfort
but
her
tongue
refused
to
speak
them
she
knew
so
well
so
woefully
well
how
very
wooden
and
mechanical
the
little
music
teacher
playing
always
had
been
but
that
marie
should
realize
it
herself
like
this
the
tragedy
of
it
made
billy
heart
ache
at
marie
next
words
however
billy
caught
her
breath
in
surprise
but
you
see
it
was
music
it
was
ever
music
that
i
wanted
to
do
she
confessed
it
was
music
but
what
i
do
understand
murmured
billy
no
i
suppose
not
sighed
the
other
you
play
so
beautifully
but
i
thought
you
loved
i
do
i
love
it
dearly
in
others
but
i
ca
i
do
want
to
make
it
but
what
do
you
want
to
do
marie
laughed
suddenly
do
you
know
my
dear
i
have
half
a
mind
to
tell
you
what
i
do
like
to
do
just
to
make
you
well
billy
eyes
were
wide
with
interest
i
like
best
of
anything
to
darn
stockings
and
make
marie
rank
heresy
is
it
smiled
marie
tearfully
but
i
do
truly
i
love
to
weave
the
threads
evenly
in
and
out
and
see
a
big
hole
close
as
for
the
puddings
i
do
mean
the
common
kind
but
the
ones
that
have
whites
of
eggs
and
fruit
and
pretty
quivery
jellies
all
ruby
and
amber
lights
you
you
dear
little
piece
of
domesticity
laughed
billy
then
why
in
the
world
do
you
do
these
things
i
ca
in
my
own
kitchen
i
ca
afford
a
kitchen
to
do
them
in
and
i
just
could
do
them
right
along
in
other
people
but
why
do
you
play
i
was
brought
up
to
it
you
know
we
had
money
once
lots
of
it
sighed
marie
as
if
she
were
deploring
a
misfortune
and
mother
was
determined
to
have
me
musical
even
then
as
a
little
tot
i
liked
and
after
my
days
i
was
always
begging
mother
to
let
me
go
down
into
the
kitchen
to
cook
but
she
would
allow
it
ever
she
engaged
the
most
expensive
masters
and
set
me
practising
always
practising
i
simply
had
to
learn
music
and
i
learned
it
like
the
adding
machine
then
afterward
when
father
died
and
then
mother
and
the
money
flew
away
why
of
course
i
had
to
do
something
so
naturally
i
turned
to
the
music
it
was
all
i
could
do
but
well
you
know
how
it
is
dear
i
teach
and
teach
well
perhaps
so
far
as
the
mechanical
part
goes
but
as
for
the
rest
i
am
always
longing
for
a
cozy
corner
with
a
basket
of
stockings
to
mend
or
a
kitchen
where
there
is
a
pudding
waiting
to
be
you
poor
dear
cried
billy
i
a
pair
of
stockings
now
that
needs
attention
and
i
been
just
longing
for
one
of
your
jellies
all
ruby
and
amber
lights
ever
since
you
mentioned
them
but
well
is
there
anything
i
could
do
to
help
nothing
thank
you
sighed
marie
rising
wearily
to
her
feet
and
covering
her
eyes
with
her
hand
for
a
moment
my
head
aches
shockingly
but
i
got
to
go
this
minute
and
instruct
little
jennie
knowls
how
to
play
the
wonderful
scale
of
g
with
a
black
key
in
it
besides
you
do
help
me
you
have
helped
me
you
are
always
helping
me
dear
she
added
remorsefully
and
it
wicked
of
me
to
make
that
shadow
come
to
your
eyes
please
do
think
of
it
or
of
me
any
and
with
a
choking
little
sob
she
hurried
from
the
room
followed
by
the
amazed
questioning
sorrowful
eyes
of
billy
chapter
xxviii
i
going
to
win
nearly
all
of
billy
friends
knew
that
bertram
henshaw
was
in
love
with
billy
neilson
before
billy
herself
knew
it
not
that
they
regarded
it
as
anything
serious
it
only
bertram
was
still
said
of
him
on
almost
all
occasions
but
to
bertram
himself
it
was
very
serious
the
world
to
bertram
indeed
had
come
to
assume
a
vastly
different
aspect
from
what
it
had
displayed
in
times
past
heretofore
it
had
been
a
plaything
which
like
a
juggler
tinsel
ball
might
be
tossed
from
hand
to
hand
at
will
now
it
was
no
plaything
no
glittering
bauble
it
was
something
big
and
serious
and
splendid
because
billy
lived
in
it
something
that
demanded
all
his
powers
to
do
and
be
because
billy
was
watching
something
that
might
be
a
hades
of
torment
or
an
elysium
of
bliss
according
to
whether
billy
said
no
or
since
thanksgiving
bertram
had
known
that
it
was
love
this
consuming
fire
within
him
and
since
thanksgiving
he
had
known
too
that
it
was
jealousy
this
fierce
hatred
of
calderwell
he
was
ashamed
of
the
hatred
he
told
himself
that
it
was
unmanly
unkind
and
unreasonable
and
he
vowed
that
he
would
overcome
it
at
times
he
even
fancied
that
he
had
overcome
it
but
always
the
sight
of
calderwell
in
billy
little
or
of
even
the
man
card
on
billy
silver
tray
was
enough
to
show
him
that
he
had
not
there
were
others
too
who
annoyed
bertram
not
a
little
foremost
of
these
being
his
own
brothers
still
he
was
not
really
worried
about
william
and
cyril
he
told
himself
william
he
did
not
consider
to
be
a
marrying
man
and
cyril
every
one
knew
that
cyril
was
a
he
was
doubtless
attracted
now
only
by
billy
music
there
was
no
real
rivalry
to
be
feared
from
william
and
cyril
but
there
was
always
calderwell
and
calderwell
was
serious
bertram
decided
therefore
after
some
weeks
of
feverish
unrest
that
the
only
road
to
peace
lay
through
a
frank
avowal
of
his
feelings
and
a
direct
appeal
to
billy
to
give
him
the
great
boon
of
her
love
just
here
however
bertram
met
with
an
unexpected
difficulty
he
could
not
find
words
with
which
to
make
his
avowal
or
to
present
his
appeal
he
was
surprised
and
annoyed
never
before
had
he
been
at
a
loss
for
words
mere
words
and
it
was
not
that
he
lacked
opportunity
he
walked
drove
and
talked
with
billy
and
always
she
was
companionable
attentive
to
what
he
had
to
say
never
was
she
cold
or
reserved
never
did
she
fail
to
greet
him
with
a
cheery
smile
bertram
concluded
indeed
after
a
time
that
she
was
too
companionable
too
cheery
he
wished
she
would
hesitate
stammer
blush
be
a
little
shy
he
wished
that
she
would
display
surprise
annoyance
even
anything
but
that
eternal
air
of
comradeship
and
then
one
afternoon
in
the
early
twilight
of
a
january
day
he
freed
his
mind
quite
unexpectedly
billy
i
wish
you
would
be
so
so
friendly
he
exclaimed
in
a
voice
that
was
almost
sharp
billy
laughed
at
first
but
the
next
moment
a
shamed
distress
drove
the
merriment
quite
out
of
her
face
you
mean
that
i
presume
on
on
our
friendship
she
stammered
that
you
fear
that
i
will
again
shadow
your
footsteps
it
was
the
first
time
since
the
memorable
night
itself
that
billy
had
ever
in
presence
referred
to
her
young
guardianship
of
his
welfare
she
realized
now
suddenly
that
she
had
just
been
giving
the
man
before
her
some
very
sisterly
advice
and
the
thought
sent
a
confused
red
to
her
cheeks
bertram
turned
quickly
billy
that
was
the
dearest
and
loveliest
thing
a
girl
ever
did
only
i
was
too
great
a
chump
to
appreciate
it
finished
bertram
in
a
voice
that
was
not
quite
steady
thank
you
smiled
the
girl
with
a
slow
shake
of
her
head
and
a
relieved
look
in
her
eyes
but
i
afraid
i
ca
quite
agree
to
the
next
moment
she
had
demanded
mischievously
why
then
pray
this
unflattering
objection
to
my
friendliness
now
because
i
do
want
you
for
a
friend
or
a
sister
or
anything
else
that
related
stormed
bertram
with
sudden
vehemence
i
do
want
you
for
anything
but
a
wife
billy
wo
you
marry
me
again
billy
laughed
laughed
until
she
saw
the
pained
anger
leap
to
the
gray
eyes
before
her
then
she
became
grave
at
once
bertram
forgive
me
i
did
think
you
could
you
ca
be
serious
but
i
billy
shook
her
head
but
you
do
love
me
not
me
bertram
it
only
the
turn
of
my
head
or
or
the
tilt
of
my
chin
that
you
love
to
paint
she
protested
unconsciously
echoing
the
words
calderwell
had
said
to
her
weeks
before
i
only
another
of
a
girl
you
the
only
of
a
girl
to
me
now
billy
declared
the
man
with
disarming
tenderness
no
no
not
that
demurred
billy
in
distress
you
do
mean
it
you
only
think
you
do
it
could
be
that
it
ca
be
but
it
is
dear
i
think
i
have
loved
you
ever
since
that
night
long
ago
when
i
saw
your
dear
startled
face
appealing
to
me
from
beyond
seaver
hateful
smile
and
billy
i
never
went
once
with
seaver
again
anywhere
did
you
know
that
no
but
i
glad
so
glad
and
i
glad
too
so
you
see
i
must
have
loved
you
then
though
unconsciously
perhaps
and
i
love
you
no
no
please
do
say
that
it
ca
be
it
really
ca
be
i
i
do
love
you
that
way
the
man
paled
a
little
billy
forgive
me
for
asking
but
it
so
much
to
me
is
it
that
there
is
some
one
else
his
voice
shook
no
no
indeed
there
is
no
it
not
calderwell
billy
forehead
grew
pink
she
laughed
nervously
no
no
never
but
there
are
others
so
many
others
nonsense
bertram
there
no
one
no
one
i
assure
you
it
not
william
of
course
nor
cyril
cyril
hates
a
deeper
flush
came
to
billy
face
her
chin
rose
a
little
and
an
odd
defiance
flashed
from
her
eyes
but
almost
instantly
it
was
gone
and
a
slow
smile
had
come
to
her
lips
yes
i
know
every
one
says
that
cyril
hates
women
she
observed
demurely
then
billy
i
give
up
vowed
bertram
softly
sometime
you
will
love
me
no
no
i
could
that
is
i
not
going
to
to
marry
stammered
billy
not
going
to
marry
no
there
my
music
you
know
how
i
love
that
and
how
much
it
is
to
me
i
do
think
there
ever
be
a
man
that
i
love
bertram
lifted
his
head
very
slowly
he
rose
till
his
splendid
six
feet
of
strength
and
manly
beauty
towered
away
above
the
low
chair
in
which
billy
sat
his
mouth
showed
new
lines
about
the
corners
and
his
eyes
looked
down
very
tenderly
at
the
girl
beside
him
but
his
voice
when
he
spoke
had
a
light
whimsicality
that
deceived
even
billy
ears
and
so
it
music
a
cold
senseless
thing
of
spidery
marks
on
clean
white
paper
that
is
my
only
rival
he
cried
then
i
warn
you
billy
i
warn
you
i
going
to
win
and
with
that
he
was
gone
chapter
xxix
i
not
going
to
marry
billy
did
not
know
whether
to
be
more
amazed
or
amused
at
proposal
of
marriage
she
was
vexed
she
was
very
sure
of
that
to
marry
bertram
absurd
then
she
reflected
that
after
all
it
was
only
bertram
so
she
calmed
herself
still
it
was
annoying
she
liked
bertram
she
had
always
liked
him
he
was
a
nice
boy
and
a
most
congenial
companion
he
never
bored
her
as
did
some
others
and
he
was
always
thoughtful
of
cushions
and
footstools
and
cups
of
tea
when
one
was
tired
he
was
in
fact
an
ideal
friend
just
the
sort
she
wanted
and
it
was
such
a
pity
that
he
must
spoil
it
all
now
with
this
silly
sentimentality
and
of
course
he
had
spoiled
it
all
there
was
no
going
back
now
to
their
old
friendliness
he
would
be
morose
or
silly
by
turns
according
to
whether
she
frowned
or
smiled
or
else
he
would
take
himself
off
in
a
tragic
sort
of
way
that
was
very
disturbing
he
had
said
to
be
sure
that
he
would
win
indeed
as
if
she
could
marry
bertram
when
she
married
her
choice
would
fall
upon
a
man
not
a
boy
a
big
grave
earnest
man
to
whom
the
world
meant
something
a
man
who
loved
music
of
course
a
man
who
would
single
her
out
from
all
the
world
and
show
to
her
and
to
her
only
the
depth
and
tenderness
of
his
love
a
man
who
but
she
was
not
going
to
marry
anyway
remembered
billy
suddenly
and
with
that
she
began
to
cry
the
whole
thing
was
so
tiresome
she
declared
and
so
billy
rather
dreaded
her
next
meeting
with
bertram
she
feared
she
knew
not
what
but
as
it
turned
out
she
need
not
have
feared
anything
for
he
met
her
tranquilly
cheerfully
as
usual
and
he
did
nothing
and
said
nothing
that
he
might
not
have
done
and
said
before
that
twilight
chat
took
place
billy
was
relieved
she
concluded
that
after
all
bertram
was
going
to
be
sensible
she
decided
that
she
too
would
be
sensible
she
would
accept
him
on
this
his
chosen
plane
and
she
would
think
no
more
of
his
billy
threw
herself
then
even
more
enthusiastically
into
her
beloved
work
she
told
marie
that
after
all
was
said
and
done
there
could
not
be
any
man
that
would
tip
the
scales
one
inch
with
music
on
the
other
side
she
was
a
little
hurt
it
is
true
when
marie
only
laughed
and
answered
but
what
if
the
man
and
the
music
both
happen
to
be
on
the
same
side
my
dear
what
then
marie
voice
was
wistful
in
spite
of
the
laugh
so
wistful
that
it
reminded
billy
of
their
conversation
a
few
weeks
before
but
it
is
you
marie
who
want
the
stockings
to
darn
and
the
puddings
to
make
she
retorted
playfully
not
i
and
do
you
know
i
believe
i
shall
turn
matchmaker
yet
and
find
you
a
man
and
the
chiefest
of
his
qualifications
shall
be
that
he
wretchedly
hard
on
his
hose
and
that
he
adores
no
no
miss
billy
do
please
begged
the
other
in
quick
terror
forget
all
i
said
the
other
day
please
do
do
tell
anybody
she
was
so
obviously
distressed
and
frightened
that
billy
was
puzzled
there
there
was
only
a
jest
of
course
she
soothed
her
but
really
marie
it
is
the
dear
domestic
little
mouse
like
yourself
that
ought
to
be
somebody
wife
and
that
the
kind
men
are
looking
for
marie
gave
a
slow
shake
of
her
head
not
the
kind
of
man
that
is
somebody
that
does
something
she
objected
and
that
the
only
kind
i
could
love
he
wants
a
wife
that
is
beautiful
and
clever
that
can
do
things
like
himself
like
himself
she
iterated
feverishly
billy
opened
wide
her
eyes
why
marie
one
would
think
you
already
knew
such
a
man
she
cried
the
little
music
teacher
changed
her
position
and
turned
her
eyes
away
i
do
of
course
she
retorted
in
a
merry
voice
lots
of
them
you
come
we
discussed
my
matrimonial
prospects
quite
long
enough
she
went
on
lightly
you
know
we
started
with
yours
suppose
we
go
back
to
but
i
have
any
demurred
billy
as
she
turned
with
a
smile
to
greet
aunt
hannah
who
had
just
entered
the
room
i
not
going
to
marry
am
i
aunt
hannah
er
what
marry
my
grief
and
conscience
what
a
question
billy
of
course
you
going
to
marry
when
the
time
comes
exclaimed
aunt
hannah
billy
laughed
and
shook
her
head
vigorously
but
even
as
she
opened
her
lips
to
reply
rosa
appeared
and
announced
that
calderwell
was
waiting
billy
was
angry
then
for
after
the
maid
was
gone
the
merriment
in
aunt
hannah
laugh
only
matched
that
in
marie
and
the
intonation
was
unmistakable
well
i
not
declared
billy
with
pink
cheeks
and
much
indignation
as
she
left
the
room
and
as
if
to
convince
herself
marie
aunt
hannah
and
all
the
world
that
such
was
the
case
she
refused
calderwell
so
decidedly
that
night
when
he
for
the
time
laid
his
hand
and
heart
at
her
feet
that
even
calderwell
himself
was
convinced
so
far
as
his
own
case
was
concerned
and
left
town
the
next
day
bertram
told
aunt
hannah
afterward
that
he
understood
calderwell
had
gone
to
parts
unknown
to
himself
bertram
shamelessly
owned
that
the
more
unknown
they
were
the
better
he
himself
would
be
pleased

marie
finds
a
friend
it
was
on
a
very
cold
january
afternoon
and
cyril
was
hurrying
up
the
hill
toward
billy
house
when
he
was
startled
to
see
a
slender
young
woman
sitting
on
a
curbstone
with
her
head
against
an
post
he
stopped
abruptly
i
beg
your
pardon
but
why
miss
hawthorn
it
is
miss
hawthorn
it
under
his
questioning
eyes
the
girl
pale
face
became
so
painfully
scarlet
that
in
sheer
pity
the
man
turned
his
eyes
away
he
thought
he
had
seen
women
blush
before
but
he
decided
now
that
he
had
not
i
sure
have
i
met
you
at
miss
neilson
are
you
ill
ca
i
do
something
for
you
he
begged
yes
no
that
is
i
am
miss
hawthorn
and
i
met
you
at
miss
neilson
stammered
the
girl
faintly
but
there
is
anything
thank
you
that
you
can
do
henshaw
i
stopped
to
the
man
frowned
but
surely
pardon
me
miss
hawthorn
but
i
ca
think
it
your
usual
custom
to
choose
an
icy
curbstone
for
a
resting
place
with
the
thermometer
down
to
zero
you
must
be
let
me
take
you
to
miss
no
no
thank
you
cried
the
girl
struggling
to
her
feet
the
vivid
red
again
flooding
her
face
i
have
a
lesson
to
nonsense
you
not
fit
to
give
a
lesson
besides
they
are
all
folderol
anyway
half
of
them
a
dozen
lessons
more
or
less
make
any
difference
they
play
just
as
well
and
just
as
atrociously
come
i
insist
upon
taking
you
to
miss
no
no
thank
you
i
really
must
i
she
could
say
no
more
a
strong
yet
very
gentle
hand
had
taken
firm
hold
of
her
arm
in
such
a
way
as
half
to
support
her
a
force
quite
outside
of
herself
was
carrying
her
forward
step
by
step
and
miss
hawthorn
was
not
used
to
strong
gentle
hands
nor
yet
to
a
force
quite
outside
of
herself
neither
was
she
accustomed
to
walk
arm
in
arm
with
cyril
henshaw
to
miss
billy
door
when
she
reached
there
her
cheeks
were
like
red
roses
for
color
and
her
eyes
were
like
the
stars
for
brightness
yet
a
minute
later
confronted
by
miss
billy
astonished
eyes
the
stars
and
the
roses
fled
and
a
very
girl
fell
over
in
a
deathlike
faint
in
cyril
henshaw
arms
marie
was
put
to
bed
in
the
little
room
next
to
billy
and
was
peremptorily
hushed
when
faint
remonstrance
was
made
the
next
morning
and
she
resolutely
pulled
herself
half
upright
and
announced
that
she
was
all
well
and
must
go
home
home
to
marie
was
a
hall
in
a
south
end
lodging
house
very
gently
billy
pushed
her
back
on
the
pillow
and
laid
a
detaining
hand
on
her
arm
no
dear
now
please
be
sensible
and
listen
to
reason
you
are
my
guest
you
did
not
know
it
perhaps
for
i
afraid

invitation

a
little
delayed
but
you
to
stay
oh
lots
of
i
stay
here
why
i
ca
indeed
i
ca
protested
marie
but
that
is
a
bit
of
a
nice
way
to
accept
an
invitation
disapproved
billy
you
should
say
you
i
be
delighted
sure
and
i
stay
in
spite
of
herself
the
little
music
teacher
laughed
and
in
the
laugh
her
tense
muscles
relaxed
miss
billy
miss
billy
what
is
one
to
do
with
you
surely
you
know
you
must
know
that
i
ca
do
what
you

i
sure

do
see
why

argued
billy
i
merely
giving
you
an
invitation
and
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
accept
but
the
invitation
is
only
the
kind
way
your
heart
has
of
covering
another
of
your
many
charities
objected
marie
besides
i
have
to
teach
i
have
my
living
to
but
you
ca
demurred
the
other
that
just
the
trouble
you
see
the
doctor
said
last
night
that
you
must
not
teach
again
this
not
teach
again
this
winter
no
no
he
could
not
be
so
cruel
as
that
it
was
cruel
dear
it
was
kind
you
would
be
ill
if
you
attempted
it
now
you
get
better
he
says
all
you
need
is
rest
and
care
and
that
exactly
what
i
mean
my
guest
shall
quick
tears
came
to
the
sick
girl
eyes
there
could
be
a
kinder
heart
than
yours
miss
billy
she
murmured
but
i
could
i
really
could
be
a
burden
to
you
like
this
i
shall
go
to
some
but
you
are
going
to
be
a
burden
you
are
going
to
be
my
friend
and
a
companion
and
in
bed
like
this
well
that
would
be
impossible
smiled
billy
but
as
it
happens
you
wo
have
to
put
that
to
the
test
for
you
soon
be
up
and
dressed
the
doctor
says
so
now
surely
you
will
there
was
a
long
pause
the
little
music
teacher
eyes
had
left
face
and
were
circling
the
room
wistfully
lingering
on
the
hangings
of
filmy
lace
the
dainty
wall
covering
and
the
exquisite
water
colors
in
their
frames
at
last
she
drew
a
deep
sigh
yes
i
stay
she
breathed
rapturously
but
you
must
let
me
help
help
what
help
you
your
letters
your
your
accounts
anything
everything
and
if
you
do
let
me
help
the
music
voice
was
very
stern
now
if
you
do
let
me
help
i
shall
go
home
just
as
soon
as
i
can
walk
dear
me
dimpled
billy
and
is
that
all
well
you
shall
help
and
to
your
heart
content
too
in
fact
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
keep
you
darning
stockings
and
making
puddings
all
the
time
she
added
mischievously
as
she
left
the
room
miss
hawthorn
sat
up
the
next
day
the
day
following
in
one
of
fluttery
wrappers
as
she
called
them
she
walked
all
about
the
room
very
soon
she
was
able
to
go
and
in
an
astonishingly
short
time
she
fitted
into
the
daily
life
as
if
she
had
always
been
there
she
was
moreover
of
such
assistance
to
billy
that
even
she
herself
could
see
the
value
of
her
work
and
so
she
stayed
content
the
little
music
teacher
saw
a
good
deal
of
billy
friends
then
particularly
of
the
henshaw
brothers
and
very
glad
was
billy
to
see
the
comradeship
growing
between
them
she
had
known
that
william
would
be
kind
to
the
orphan
girl
but
she
had
feared
that
marie
would
not
understand
bertram
nonsense
or
cyril
reserve
but
very
soon
bertram
had
begged
and
obtained
permission
to
try
to
reproduce
on
canvas
the
sheen
of
the
fine
fair
hair
and
the
veiled
bloom
of
the
skin
that
were
marie
greatest
charms
and
already
cyril
had
unbent
from
his
usual
stiffness
enough
to
play
to
her
twice
so
billy
fears
on
that
score
were
at
an
end
chapter
xxxi
the
engagement
of
one
many
times
during
those
winter
days
billy
thought
of
marie
words
but
what
if
the
man
and
the
music
both
happen
to
be
on
the
same
side
they
worried
her
to
some
extent
and
curiously
they
pleased
and
displeased
her
at
the
same
time
she
told
herself
that
she
knew
very
well
of
course
what
marie
meant
it
was
cyril
he
was
the
man
and
the
music
but
was
cyril
beginning
to
care
for
her
and
did
she
want
him
to
very
seriously
one
day
billy
asked
herself
these
questions
very
calmly
she
argued
the
matter
in
her
mind
as
was
billy
way
she
was
proud
certainly
of
what
her
influence
had
apparently
done
for
cyril
she
was
gratified
that
to
her
he
was
showing
the
real
depth
and
beauty
of
his
nature
it
was
flattering
to
feel
that
she
and
only
she
had
thus
won
the
regard
of
a
professional
then
besides
all
this
there
was
his
music
his
glorious
music
think
of
the
bliss
of
living
ever
with
that
imagine
life
with
a
man
whose
soul
would
be
so
perfectly
attuned
to
hers
that
existence
would
be
one
grand
harmony
ah
that
truly
would
be
the
ideal
marriage
but
she
had
planned
not
to
marry
billy
frowned
now
and
tapped
her
foot
nervously
it
was
indeed
most
puzzling
this
question
and
she
did
not
want
to
make
a
mistake
then
too
she
did
not
wish
to
wound
cyril
if
the
dear
man
had
come
out
of
his
icy
prison
and
were
reaching
out
timid
hands
to
her
for
her
help
her
interest
her
love
the
tragedy
of
it
if
he
met
with
no
response
this
vision
of
cyril
with
outstretched
hands
and
of
herself
with
cold
averted
eyes
was
the
last
straw
in
the
balance
with
billy
she
decided
suddenly
that
she
did
care
for
cyril
a
little
and
that
she
probably
could
care
for
him
a
great
deal
with
this
thought
billy
blushed
already
in
her
own
mind
she
was
as
good
as
pledged
to
cyril
it
was
a
great
change
for
billy
this
sudden
leap
from
girlhood
and
irresponsibility
to
womanhood
and
care
but
she
took
it
fearlessly
resolutely
if
she
was
to
be
cyril
wife
she
must
make
herself
fit
for
it
and
in
pursuance
of
this
high
ideal
she
followed
marie
into
the
kitchen
the
very
next
time
the
little
music
teacher
went
out
to
make
one
of
her
dainty
desserts
that
the
family
liked
so
well
i
just
watch
if
you
do
mind
announced
billy
why
of
course
not
smiled
marie
but
i
thought
you
did
like
to
make
i
do
owned
billy
cheerfully
then
why
this
watchfulness
nothing
only
i
thought
it
might
be
just
as
well
if
i
knew
how
to
make
them
you
know
how
cyril
that
is
all
the
henshaw
boys
like
every
kind
you
the
egg
in
marie
hand
slipped
from
her
fingers
and
crashed
untidily
on
the
shelf
with
a
gleeful
laugh
billy
welcomed
the
diversion
she
had
not
meant
to
speak
so
plainly
it
was
one
thing
to
try
to
fit
herself
to
be
cyril
wife
and
quite
another
to
display
those
efforts
so
openly
before
the
world
the
pudding
was
made
at
last
but
marie
proved
to
be
a
nervous
teacher
her
hand
shook
and
her
memory
almost
failed
her
at
one
or
two
critical
points
billy
laughingly
said
that
it
must
be
stage
fright
owing
to
the
presence
of
herself
as
spectator
and
with
this
marie
promptly
and
somewhat
effusively
agreed
so
very
busy
was
billy
during
the
next
few
days
acquiring
her
new
domesticity
that
she
did
not
notice
how
little
she
was
seeing
of
cyril
then
she
suddenly
realized
it
and
asked
herself
the
reason
for
it
cyril
was
at
the
house
certainly
just
as
frequently
as
he
had
been
but
she
saw
that
a
new
shyness
in
herself
had
developed
which
was
causing
her
to
be
restless
in
his
presence
and
was
leading
her
to
like
better
to
have
marie
or
aunt
hannah
in
the
room
when
he
called
she
discovered
too
that
she
welcomed
william
and
even
bertram
with
peculiar
enthusiasm
if
they
happened
to
interrupt
a
with
cyril
billy
was
disturbed
at
this
she
told
herself
that
this
shyness
was
not
strange
perhaps
inasmuch
as
her
ideas
in
regard
to
love
and
marriage
had
undergone
so
abrupt
a
change
but
it
must
be
overcome
if
she
was
to
be
cyril
wife
she
must
like
to
be
with
him
and
of
course
she
really
did
like
to
be
with
him
for
she
had
enjoyed
his
companionship
very
much
during
all
these
past
weeks
she
set
herself
therefore
now
determinedly
to
cultivating
cyril
it
was
then
that
billy
made
a
strange
and
fearsome
discovery
there
were
some
things
about
cyril
that
she
did
not
like
billy
was
inexpressibly
shocked
heretofore
he
had
been
so
high
so
irreproachable
so
but
heretofore
he
had
been
a
friend
now
he
was
appearing
in
a
new
role
though
unconsciously
she
knew
heretofore
she
had
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
saw
only
the
delightful
and
marvelous
unfolding
of
a
coldly
reserved
nature
under
the
warmth
of
her
own
encouraging
smile
now
she
looked
at
him
with
eyes
that
saw
only
the
possibilities
of
that
same
nature
when
it
should
have
been
unfolded
in
a
lifelong
companionship
and
what
she
saw
frightened
her
there
was
still
the
music
she
acknowledged
that
but
it
had
come
to
billy
with
overwhelming
force
that
music
after
all
was
not
everything
the
man
counted
as
well
very
frankly
then
billy
stated
the
case
to
herself
what
passes
for
mystery
in
him
now
will
be
plain
moroseness
sometime
he
is
now
he
be
cross
then
it
is
when
he
wo
play
the
piano
but
a
few
years
from
now
when
he
refuses
some
simple
request
of
mine
it
will
be
stubbornness
all
this
it
will
be
if
i
do
love
him
and
i
do
i
know
i
do
besides
we
are
really
congenial
i
like
people
around
he
does
i
like
to
go
to
plays
he
does
he
likes
rainy
days
i
abhor
them
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
life
with
him
would
not
be
one
grand
harmony
it
would
be
one
jangling
discord
i
simply
can
not
marry
him
i
shall
have
to
break
the
engagement
billy
spoke
with
regretful
sorrow
it
was
evident
that
she
grieved
to
bring
pain
to
cyril
then
suddenly
the
gloom
left
her
face
she
had
remembered
that
the
engagement
was
just
three
weeks
old
and
was
a
profound
secret
not
only
to
the
bridegroom
elect
but
to
all
the
world
as
well
save
herself
billy
was
very
happy
after
that
she
sang
about
the
house
all
day
and
she
danced
sometimes
from
room
to
room
so
light
were
her
feet
and
her
heart
she
made
no
more
puddings
with
marie
supervision
but
she
was
particularly
careful
to
have
the
little
music
teacher
or
aunt
hannah
with
her
when
cyril
called
she
made
up
her
mind
it
is
true
that
she
had
been
mistaken
and
that
cyril
did
not
love
her
still
she
wished
to
be
on
the
safe
side
and
she
became
more
and
more
averse
to
being
left
alone
with
him
for
any
length
of
time
chapter
xxxii
cyril
has
something
to
say
long
before
spring
billy
was
forced
to
own
to
herself
that
her
fancied
security
from
lovemaking
on
the
part
of
cyril
no
longer
existed
she
began
to
suspect
that
there
was
reason
for
her
fears
cyril
certainly
was
he
was
more
approachable
less
reserved
even
with
marie
and
aunt
hannah
he
was
not
nearly
so
taciturn
either
and
he
was
much
more
gracious
about
his
playing
even
marie
dared
to
ask
him
frequently
for
music
and
he
never
refused
her
request
three
times
he
had
taken
billy
to
some
play
that
she
wanted
to
see
and
he
had
invited
marie
too
besides
aunt
hannah
which
had
pleased
billy
very
much
he
had
been
at
the
same
time
so
genial
and
so
gallant
that
billy
had
declared
to
marie
afterward
that
he
did
not
seem
like
himself
at
all
but
like
some
one
else
marie
had
disagreed
with
her
it
is
true
and
had
said
stiffly
i
sure
i
thought
he
seemed
very
much
like
but
that
had
not
changed
billy
opinion
at
all
to
billy
mind
nothing
but
love
could
so
have
softened
the
stern
cyril
she
had
known
she
was
therefore
all
the
more
careful
these
days
to
avoid
a
with
him
though
she
was
not
always
successful
particularly
owing
to
marie
unaccountable
perverseness
in
so
often
having
letters
to
write
or
work
to
do
just
when
billy
most
wanted
her
to
make
a
safe
third
with
herself
and
cyril
it
was
upon
such
an
occasion
after
marie
had
abruptly
left
them
alone
together
that
cyril
had
observed
a
little
sharply
billy
i
wish
you
would
say
again
what
you
said
ten
minutes
ago
when
miss
marie
was
what
was
that
a
very
silly
reference
to
that
old
notion
that
you
and
every
one
else
seem
to
have
that
i
am
a
billy
heart
skipped
a
beat
one
thought
pounded
through
her
brain
and
dinned
itself
into
her
ears
at
all
costs
cyril
must
not
be
allowed
to
say
that
which
she
so
feared
he
must
be
saved
from
himself
why
of
course
you
a
she
cried
merrily
i
sure
i
i
think
it
lovely
to
be
a
the
man
opened
wide
his
eyes
then
he
frowned
angrily
nonsense
billy
i
know
better
besides
i
in
earnest
and
i
not
a
oh
but
every
one
says
you
are
chattered
billy
and
after
all
you
know
it
is
distinguishing
with
a
disdainful
exclamation
the
man
sprang
to
his
feet
for
a
time
he
paced
the
room
in
silence
watched
by
billy
fearful
eyes
then
he
came
back
and
dropped
into
the
low
chair
at
billy
side
his
whole
manner
had
undergone
a
complete
change
he
was
almost
shamefaced
as
he
said
billy
i
suppose
i
might
as
well
own
up
i
do
think
i
did
think
much
of
women
until
i
saw
billy
swallowed
and
wet
her
lips
she
tried
to
speak
but
before
she
could
form
the
words
the
man
went
on
with
his
remarks
and
billy
did
not
know
whether
to
be
the
more
relieved
or
frightened
thereat
but
you
see
now
it
different
that
why
i
do
like
to
sail
any
longer
under
false
colors
there
been
a
change
a
great
and
wonderful
change
that
i
hardly
understand
that
it
you
do
understand
it
i
sure
interposed
billy
feverishly
it
may
not
be
such
a
change
after
all
you
may
be
deceiving
yourself
she
finished
hopefully
the
man
sighed
i
ca
wonder
you
think
so
of
course
he
almost
groaned
i
was
afraid
it
would
be
like
that
when
one
been
painted
black
all
life
it
not
easy
to
change
one
color
of
oh
but
i
did
say
that
black
was
a
very
nice
color
stammered
billy
a
little
wildly
thank
cyril
heavy
brows
rose
and
fell
the
fraction
of
an
inch
still
i
must
confess
that
just
now
i
should
prefer
another
he
paused
and
billy
cast
distractedly
about
in
her
mind
for
a
simple
natural
change
of
subject
she
had
just
decided
to
ask
him
what
he
thought
of
the
condition
of
the
brittany
peasants
when
he
questioned
abruptly
and
in
a
voice
that
was
not
quite
steady
billy
what
should
you
say
if
i
should
tell
you
that
the
avowed
had
strayed
so
far
from
the
prescribed
path
as
to
to
like
one
woman
well
enough
as
to
want
to
marry
her
the
word
was
like
a
match
to
the
gunpowder
of
billy
fears
her
was
shattered
instantly
into
bits
marry
no
no
you
would
you
could
really
be
thinking
of
that
she
babbled
growing
red
and
white
by
turns
only
think
how
a
wife
would
would
you
bother
me
when
i
loved
her
but
just
think
remember
she
want
cushions
and
rugs
and
curtains
and
you
do
like
them
and
she
always
be
talking
and
laughing
when
you
wanted
quiet
and
she
she
want
to
drag
you
out
to
plays
and
parties
and
and
everywhere
indeed
cyril
i
sure
you
never
like
a
wife
long
billy
stopped
only
because
she
had
no
breath
with
which
to
continue
cyril
laughed
a
little
grimly
you
do
draw
a
very
attractive
picture
billy
still
i
not
afraid
i
do
think
this
particular
wife
would
do
any
of
those
things
to
trouble
oh
but
you
do
know
you
ca
tell
argued
the
girl
besides
you
have
had
so
little
experience
with
women
that
you
just
be
sure
to
make
a
mistake
at
first
you
want
to
look
around
very
carefully
very
carefully
before
you
i
have
looked
around
and
very
carefully
billy
i
know
that
in
all
the
world
there
is
just
one
woman
for
billy
struggled
to
her
feet
mingled
pain
and
terror
looked
from
her
eyes
she
began
to
speak
wildly
incoherently
she
wondered
afterward
just
what
she
would
have
said
if
aunt
hannah
had
not
come
into
the
room
at
that
moment
and
announced
that
bertram
was
at
the
door
to
take
her
for
a
if
she
cared
to
go
of
course
she
go
declared
cyril
promptly
answering
for
her
it
is
time
i
was
off
to
billy
he
said
in
a
low
voice
you
have
been
very
encouraging
little
girl
in
fact
you
been
mighty
discouraging
but
some
day
some
other
day
i
try
to
make
clear
to
you
many
billy
greeted
bertram
very
cordially
it
was
such
a
relief
his
cheery
genial
companionship
the
air
too
was
bracing
and
all
the
world
lay
under
a
blanket
of
sparkling
purity
everything
was
so
beautiful
so
restful
it
was
not
surprising
perhaps
that
the
very
frankness
of
billy
joy
misled
bertram
a
little
his
blood
tingled
at
her
nearness
and
his
eyes
grew
deep
and
tender
as
he
looked
down
at
her
happy
face
but
of
all
the
eager
words
that
were
so
near
his
lips
not
one
reached
the
girl
ears
until
the
were
said
then
wistfully
bertram
hazarded
billy
do
you
think
sometimes
that
i
gaining
just
a
little
on
that
rival
of
mine
that
music
billy
face
clouded
she
shook
her
head
gently
bertram
please
do
when
we
had
such
a
beautiful
hour
together
she
begged
it
troubles
me
if
you
do
i
ca
go
but
you
shall
go
again
cried
bertram
bravely
smiling
straight
into
her
eyes
and
there
ever
anything
in
the
world
trouble
you
either
that
i
can
help
chapter
xxxiii
william
is
worried
billy
had
been
due
to
the
kindness
of
a
belated
winter
storm
that
had
surprised
every
one
the
last
of
march
after
that
march
as
if
ashamed
of
her
untoward
behavior
donned
her
sweetest
smiles
and
went
out
like
the
proverbial
lamb
with
the
coming
of
april
and
the
stirring
of
life
in
the
trees
billy
too
began
to
be
restless
and
at
the
earliest
possible
moment
she
made
her
plans
for
her
long
anticipated
digging
in
the
just
here
much
to
her
surprise
she
met
with
wonderful
assistance
from
bertram
he
seemed
to
know
just
when
and
where
and
how
to
dig
and
he
displayed
suddenly
a
remarkable
knowledge
of
landscape
gardening
that
this
knowledge
was
as
recent
in
its
acquirement
as
it
was
sudden
in
its
display
billy
did
not
know
very
learnedly
he
talked
of
perennials
and
annuals
and
without
hesitation
he
made
out
a
list
of
flowering
shrubs
and
plants
that
would
give
her
a
succession
of
bloom
throughout
the
his
words
and
phrases
smacked
loudly
of
the
very
newest
florists
catalogues
but
billy
did
not
notice
that
she
only
wondered
at
the
seemingly
exhaustless
source
of
his
wisdom
i
suspect
have
been
better
if
we
begun
things
last
fall
he
told
her
frowningly
one
day
but
there
plenty
we
can
do
now
anyway
and
we
put
in
some
things
just
for
this
season
until
we
can
get
the
more
permanent
things
and
so
they
worked
together
studying
scheming
ordering
plants
and
seeds
their
two
heads
close
together
above
the
gaily
colored
catalogues
later
there
was
the
work
itself
to
be
done
and
though
strong
men
did
the
heavier
part
there
was
yet
plenty
left
for
eager
fingers
and
for
bertram
and
if
sometimes
in
the
intimacy
of
and
the
touch
of
the
slenderer
fingers
sent
a
thrill
through
the
browner
ones
bertram
made
no
sign
he
was
careful
always
to
be
the
cheerful
helpful
assistant
and
that
was
all
billy
it
is
true
was
a
little
disturbed
at
being
quite
so
much
with
bertram
she
dreaded
a
repetition
of
some
such
words
as
had
been
uttered
at
the
end
of
the
she
told
herself
that
she
had
no
right
to
grieve
bertram
to
make
it
hard
for
him
by
being
with
him
but
at
the
very
next
breath
she
could
but
question
did
she
grieve
him
was
it
hard
for
him
to
have
her
with
him
then
she
would
glance
at
his
eager
face
and
meet
his
buoyant
smile
and
answer
after
that
for
a
time
at
least
her
fears
would
be
less
systematically
billy
avoided
cyril
these
days
she
could
not
forget
his
promise
to
make
many
things
clear
to
her
some
day
she
thought
she
knew
what
he
meant
that
he
would
try
to
convince
her
as
she
had
tried
to
convince
herself
that
she
would
make
a
good
wife
for
him
billy
was
very
sure
that
if
cyril
could
be
prevented
from
speaking
his
mind
just
now
his
mind
would
change
in
time
hence
her
determination
to
give
his
mind
that
opportunity
billy
avoidance
of
cyril
was
the
more
easily
accomplished
because
she
was
for
a
time
taking
a
complete
rest
from
her
music
the
new
songs
had
been
finished
and
sent
to
the
publishers
there
was
no
excuse
therefore
for
cyril
coming
to
the
house
on
that
score
and
indeed
he
seemed
of
his
own
accord
to
be
making
only
infrequent
visits
now
billy
was
pleased
particularly
as
marie
was
not
there
to
play
third
party
marie
had
taken
up
her
teaching
again
much
to
billy
distress
but
i
ca
stay
here
always
like
this
marie
had
protested
but
i
should
like
to
keep
you
billy
had
responded
with
no
less
decision
marie
had
been
firm
however
and
had
gone
leaving
the
little
house
lonely
without
her
aside
from
her
work
in
the
garden
billy
as
resolutely
avoided
bertram
as
she
did
cyril
it
was
natural
therefore
that
at
this
crisis
she
should
turn
to
william
with
a
peculiar
feeling
of
restfulness
he
at
least
would
be
safe
she
told
herself
so
she
frankly
welcomed
his
every
appearance
sung
to
him
played
to
him
and
took
long
walks
with
him
to
see
some
wonderful
bracelet
or
necklace
that
he
had
discovered
in
a
dingy
little
william
was
delighted
he
was
very
fond
of
his
namesake
and
he
had
secretly
chafed
a
little
at
the
way
his
younger
brothers
had
monopolized
her
attention
he
was
rejoiced
now
that
she
seemed
to
be
turning
to
him
for
companionship
and
very
eagerly
he
accepted
all
the
time
she
could
give
him
william
had
in
truth
been
growing
more
and
more
lonely
ever
since
billy
brief
stay
beneath
his
roof
years
before
those
few
short
weeks
of
her
merry
presence
had
shown
him
how
very
forlorn
the
house
was
without
it
more
and
more
sorrowfully
during
past
years
his
thoughts
had
gone
back
to
the
little
white
flannel
bundle
and
to
the
dear
hopes
it
had
carried
so
long
ago
if
the
boy
had
only
lived
thought
william
mournfully
there
would
not
now
have
been
that
dreary
silence
in
his
home
and
that
sore
ache
in
his
heart
very
soon
after
william
had
first
seen
billy
he
began
to
lay
wonderful
plans
and
in
every
plan
was
billy
she
was
not
his
child
by
flesh
and
blood
he
acknowledged
but
she
was
his
by
right
of
love
and
needed
care
in
fancy
he
looked
straight
down
the
years
ahead
and
everywhere
he
saw
billy
a
loving
daughter
the
joy
of
his
life
the
solace
of
his
declining
years
to
no
one
had
william
talked
of
this
and
to
no
one
did
he
show
the
bitterness
of
his
grief
when
he
saw
his
vision
fade
into
nothingness
through
billy
unchanging
refusal
to
live
in
his
home
only
he
himself
knew
the
heartache
the
loneliness
the
almost
unbearable
longing
of
the
past
winter
months
while
billy
had
lived
at
hillside
and
only
he
himself
knew
now
the
almost
overwhelming
joy
that
was
his
because
of
what
he
thought
he
saw
in
billy
changed
attitude
toward
himself
great
as
was
william
joy
however
his
caution
was
greater
he
said
nothing
to
billy
of
his
new
hopes
though
he
did
try
to
pave
the
way
by
dropping
an
occasional
word
about
the
loneliness
of
the
beacon
street
house
since
she
went
away
there
was
something
else
too
that
caused
william
to
be
silent
what
he
thought
he
saw
between
billy
and
bertram
that
bertram
was
in
love
with
billy
he
guessed
but
that
billy
was
not
in
love
with
bertram
he
very
much
feared
he
hesitated
almost
to
speak
or
move
lest
something
he
should
say
or
do
should
just
at
the
critical
moment
turn
matters
the
wrong
way
to
william
this
marriage
of
bertram
and
billy
was
an
ideal
method
of
solving
the
problem
as
of
course
billy
would
come
there
to
the
house
to
live
and
he
would
have
his
daughter
after
all
but
as
the
days
passed
and
he
could
see
no
progress
on
bertram
part
no
change
in
billy
he
began
to
be
seriously
worried
and
to
show
it
chapter
xxxiv
class
day
early
in
june
billy
announced
her
intention
of
not
going
away
at
all
that
summer
i
do
need
it
she
declared
i
have
this
cool
beautiful
house
this
air
this
sunshine
this
adorable
view
besides
i
got
a
scheme
i
mean
to
carry
there
was
some
consternation
among
billy
friends
when
they
found
out
what
this
scheme
was
sundry
of
billy
humbler
acquaintances
were
to
share
the
house
the
air
the
sunshine
and
the
adorable
view
with
her
but
my
dear
billy
bertram
cried
aghast
you
do
mean
to
say
that
you
are
going
to
turn
your
beautiful
little
house
into
a
place
for
boston
slum
children
not
a
bit
of
it
smiled
the
girl
though
i
like
to
really
if
i
could
she
added
perversely
but
this
is
quite
another
thing
it
no
slum
work
no
charity
in
the
first
place
my
guests
are
quite
so
poor
as
that
and
they
much
too
proud
to
be
reached
by
the
avowed
charity
worker
but
they
need
it
just
the
but
you
have
much
spare
room
have
you
questioned
bertram
no
unfortunately
so
i
shall
have
to
take
only
two
or
three
at
a
time
and
keep
them
maybe
a
week
or
ten
days
it
just
a
sugar
plum
bertram
truly
it
is
she
added
whimsically
but
with
a
tender
light
in
her
eyes
but
who
are
these
people
bertram
face
had
lost
its
look
of
shocked
surprise
and
his
voice
expressed
genuine
interest
well
to
begin
with
there
marie
she
stay
all
summer
and
help
me
entertain
my
guests
at
the
same
time
her
duties
wo
be
arduous
and
she
get
a
little
playtime
herself
one
week
i
going
to
have
a
little
old
maid
who
keeps
a
lodging
house
in
the
west
end
for
uncounted
years
she
been
practically
tied
to
a
doorbell
with
never
a
whole
day
to
breathe
free
i
made
arrangements
there
for
a
sister
to
keep
house
a
whole
week
and
i
going
to
show
this
little
old
maid
things
she
has
seen
for
years
the
ocean
the
green
fields
and
a
summer
play
or
two
perhaps
then
there
a
little
couple
that
live
in
a
flat
in
south
boston
they
young
and
like
good
times
but
the
man
is
on
a
small
salary
and
they
have
had
lots
of
sickness
he
been
out
so
much
he
ca
take
any
vacation
and
they
would
have
any
money
to
go
anywhere
if
he
could
well
i
going
to
have
them
a
week
she
be
here
all
the
time
and
he
come
out
at
night
of
course
another
one
is
a
widow
with
six
children
the
children
are
already
provided
for
by
a
society
but
the
woman
i
going
to
take
and
and
give
her
a
whole
week
of
food
that
she
did
have
to
cook
herself
another
one
is
a
woman
who
is
not
so
very
poor
but
who
has
lost
her
baby
and
is
blue
and
discouraged
there
are
some
children
too
one
crippled
and
a
boy
who
says
he
lonesome
and
there
are
really
bertram
there
is
no
end
to
i
can
well
believe
that
declared
bertram
with
emphasis
so
far
as
your
generous
heart
is
billy
colored
and
looked
distressed
but
it
is
generosity
or
charity
at
all
bertram
she
protested
you
are
mistaken
when
you
think
it
is
really
why
i
shall
enjoy
every
bit
of
it
just
as
well
as
they
do
and
better
but
you
stay
here
in
the
city
all
summer
for
their
what
if
i
do
besides
this
is
the
real
city
argued
billy
with
all
these
trees
and
lawns
about
one
and
another
thing
she
added
leaning
forward
confidentially
i
might
as
well
confess
bertram
you
could
hire
me
to
leave
the
place
this
summer
not
while
all
these
things
i
planted
are
coming
up
bertram
laughed
but
for
some
reason
he
looked
wonderfully
happy
as
he
turned
away
on
the
fifteenth
of
june
kate
and
her
husband
arrived
from
the
west
a
young
brother
of
hartwell
was
to
be
graduated
from
harvard
and
kate
said
they
had
come
on
to
represent
the
family
as
the
elder
and
hartwell
were
not
strong
enough
to
undertake
the
journey
kate
was
looking
well
and
happy
she
greeted
billy
with
effusive
cordiality
and
openly
expressed
her
admiration
of
hillside
she
looked
very
keenly
into
her
brothers
face
and
seemed
well
pleased
with
the
appearance
of
cyril
and
bertram
but
not
so
much
so
with
william
countenance
william
does
not
look
well
she
declared
one
day
when
she
and
billy
were
alone
together
sick
uncle
william
sick
oh
i
hope
not
cried
the
girl
i
do
know
whether
it
or
not
returned
hartwell
but
it
something
he
troubled
i
going
to
speak
to
him
he
worried
over
something
and
he
grown
terribly
but
he
always
thin
reasoned
billy
i
know
but
not
like
this
ever
you
do
notice
it
perhaps
or
realize
it
seeing
him
every
day
as
you
do
but
i
know
something
troubles
oh
i
hope
not
murmured
billy
with
anxious
eyes
we
do
want
uncle
william
troubled
we
all
love
him
too
hartwell
did
not
at
once
reply
but
for
a
long
minute
she
thoughtfully
studied
billy
face
as
it
was
bent
above
the
sewing
in
billy
hand
when
she
did
speak
she
had
changed
the
subject
young
hartwell
was
to
deliver
the
ivy
oration
in
the
stadium
on
class
day
and
all
the
henshaws
were
looking
eagerly
forward
to
the
occasion
you
have
seen
the
stadium
of
course
said
bertram
to
billy
a
few
days
before
the
anticipated
friday
only
from
across
the
is
that
so
and
you
never
been
here
class
day
either
good
then
you
got
a
treat
in
store
just
wait
and
see
and
billy
waited
and
she
saw
billy
began
to
see
in
fact
before
class
day
young
hartwell
was
a
popular
fellow
and
he
was
eager
to
have
his
friends
meet
billy
and
the
henshaws
he
was
a
member
of
the
institute
of
stylus
signet
round
table
and
hasty
pudding
clubs
and
nearly
every
one
of
these
had
some
sort
of
function
planned
for
week
by
the
time
the
day
itself
arrived
billy
was
almost
as
excited
as
was
young
hartwell
himself
it
rained
morning
but
at
nine
the
sun
came
out
and
drove
the
clouds
away
much
to
every
one
delight
billy
day
began
at
noon
with
the
spread
given
by
the
hasty
pudding
club
billy
wondered
afterward
how
many
times
that
day
remarks
like
these
were
made
to
her
you
been
here
class
day
before
of
course
you
seen
the
no
well
you
just
wait
at
ten
minutes
of
four
billy
and
hartwell
with
hartwell
and
bertram
as
escorts
entered
the
cool
echoing
shadows
under
the
stadium
and
then
out
in
the
sunlight
they
began
to
climb
the
broad
steps
to
their
seats
i
wanted
them
high
up
you
see
explained
bertram
because
you
can
get
the
effect
so
much
better
there
here
we
are
for
the
first
time
billy
turned
and
looked
about
her
she
gave
a
low
cry
of
delight
oh
oh
how
beautiful
how
wonderfully
beautiful
you
just
wait
crowed
bertram
if
you
think
this
is
beautiful
you
just
wait
billy
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
her
eyes
were
sweeping
the
wonderful
scene
before
her
and
her
face
was
aglow
with
delight
first
there
was
the
great
amphitheater
itself
only
the
wide
curve
of
the
horseshoe
was
roped
off
for
audience
beyond
lay
the
two
sides
with
their
tier
above
tier
of
empty
seats
almost
dazzling
in
the
sunshine
within
the
curve
the
scene
was
of
kaleidoscopic
beauty
charmingly
gowned
young
women
and
carefully
groomed
young
men
were
everywhere
stirring
chatting
laughing
parasols
and
hats
made
here
and
there
brilliant
splashes
of
rainbow
tints
above
was
an
almost
cloudless
canopy
of
blue
and
at
the
far
horizon
earth
and
sky
met
and
made
a
picture
that
was
like
a
wondrous
painted
curtain
hung
from
heaven
itself
at
the
first
sound
of
the
distant
band
that
told
of
the
coming
bertram
said
almost
wistfully
class
day
is
the
only
time
when
i
feel
of
it
you
see
i
the
first
male
henshaw
for
ages
that
has
been
through
harvard
and
you
know
is
the
time
when
the
old
grads
come
back
and
do
stunts
like
the
kids
if
they
can
and
some
of
them
can
all
right
they
march
in
by
classes
ahead
of
the
seniors
and
vie
with
each
other
in
giving
their
yells
you
see
cyril
and
william
if
your
eyes
are
sharp
enough
and
you
see
them
as
you
never
saw
them
far
down
the
green
field
billy
spied
now
the
long
black
line
of
moving
figures
with
a
band
in
the
lead
nearer
and
nearer
it
came
until
greeted
by
a
mighty
roar
from
thousands
of
throats
the
leaders
swept
into
the
great
bowl
of
the
horseshoe
curve
and
how
they
yelled
and
cheered
those
men
whose
first
class
day
lay
five
ten
fifteen
even
twenty
or
more
years
behind
them
as
told
by
the
banners
which
they
so
proudly
carried
how
they
got
their
heads
together
and
gave
the
rah
rah
rah
with
unswerving
eyes
on
their
leader
how
they
beat
the
air
with
their
hats
in
time
to
their
lusty
shouts
and
how
the
throngs
above
cheered
and
clapped
in
answer
until
they
almost
split
their
throats
and
did
split
their
gloves
especially
when
the
seniors
swept
into
view
and
when
the
curving
line
of
black
had
become
one
solid
mass
of
humanity
that
filled
the
bowl
from
side
to
side
the
vast
throng
seated
themselves
and
a
great
hush
fell
while
the
glee
club
sang
young
hartwell
proved
to
be
a
good
speaker
and
his
ringing
voice
reached
even
the
topmost
tier
of
seats
billy
was
charmed
and
interested
everything
she
saw
and
heard
was
but
a
new
source
of
enjoyment
and
she
had
quite
forgotten
the
thing
for
which
she
was
to
wait
when
she
saw
the
ushers
passing
through
the
aisles
with
their
baskets
of
packages
of
confetti
and
countless
rolls
of
paper
ribbon
it
began
then
the
merry
war
between
the
students
below
and
the
throng
above
in
a
trice
the
air
was
filled
with
shimmering
bits
of
red
blue
white
green
purple
pink
and
yellow
from
all
directions
fluttering
streamers
that
showed
every
color
of
the
rainbow
were
flung
to
the
breeze
until
upheld
by
the
supporting
wires
they
made
a
fairy
lace
work
of
marvelous
beauty
oh
oh
oh
cried
billy
her
eyes
misty
with
emotion
i
think
i
never
saw
anything
in
my
life
so
lovely
i
thought
you
like
it
gloried
bertram
you
know
i
said
to
wait
but
even
with
this
class
day
for
billy
was
not
finished
there
was
still
hartwell
own
spread
from
six
to
eight
and
after
that
there
were
the
president
reception
and
dancing
in
the
memorial
hall
and
in
the
gymnasium
there
was
the
fairyland
of
the
yard
too
softly
aglow
with
moving
throngs
of
beautiful
women
and
gallant
men
but
what
billy
remembered
best
of
all
was
the
exquisite
harmony
that
came
to
her
through
the
hushed
night
air
when
the
glee
club
sang
fair
harvard
on
the
steps
of
holworthy
hall
chapter
xxxv
sister
kate
again
it
was
on
the
sunday
following
class
day
that
hartwell
carried
out
her
determination
to
speak
to
the
west
had
not
taken
from
kate
her
love
of
managing
and
she
thought
she
saw
now
a
matter
that
sorely
needed
her
guiding
hand
william
thin
face
anxious
looks
and
nervous
manner
had
troubled
her
ever
since
she
came
then
one
day
very
suddenly
had
come
enlightenment
william
was
in
love
and
with
billy
hartwell
watched
william
very
closely
after
that
she
saw
his
eyes
follow
billy
fondly
yet
anxiously
she
saw
his
open
joy
at
being
with
her
and
at
any
little
attention
word
or
look
that
the
girl
gave
him
she
remembered
too
something
that
bertram
had
said
about
grief
because
billy
would
not
live
at
the
strata
she
thought
she
saw
something
else
also
that
billy
was
fond
of
william
but
that
william
did
not
know
it
hence
his
frequent
troubled
scrutiny
of
her
face
why
these
two
should
play
at
cross
purposes
sister
kate
could
not
understand
she
smiled
however
confidently
they
should
not
play
at
cross
purposes
much
longer
she
declared
on
sunday
afternoon
kate
asked
her
eldest
brother
to
take
her
driving
not
a
motor
car
i
want
a
horse
that
will
let
me
talk
she
said
certainly
agreed
william
with
a
smile
but
bertram
who
chanced
to
hear
her
put
in
the
sly
comment
as
if
any
horse
could
prevent
that
on
the
drive
kate
began
to
talk
at
once
but
she
did
not
plunge
into
the
subject
nearest
her
heart
until
she
had
adroitly
led
william
into
a
glowing
enumeration
of
billy
many
charming
characteristics
then
she
said
william
why
do
you
take
billy
home
with
you
william
stirred
uneasily
as
he
always
did
when
anything
annoyed
him
my
dear
kate
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
better
to
do
he
replied
then
why
do
you
do
it
i
hope
to
but
why
not
now
i
afraid
billy
is
not
quite
nonsense
a
young
girl
like
that
does
not
know
her
own
mind
lots
of
times
just
press
the
matter
a
little
love
will
work
wonders
william
blushed
like
a
girl
to
him
her
words
had
but
one
meaning
bertram
love
for
billy
william
had
never
spoken
of
this
suspected
love
affair
to
any
one
he
had
even
thought
that
he
was
the
only
one
that
had
discovered
it
to
hear
his
sister
refer
thus
lightly
to
it
came
therefore
in
the
nature
of
a
shock
to
him
then
you
have
seen
it
too
he
stammered
it
too
laughed
kate
with
her
confident
eyes
on
flushed
face
i
should
say
i
had
seen
it
any
one
could
see
william
blushed
again
love
to
him
had
always
been
something
sacred
something
that
called
for
hushed
voices
and
twilight
this
merry
discussion
in
the
sunlight
of
even
another
love
was
disconcerting
now
come
william
resumed
kate
after
a
moment
speak
to
billy
and
have
the
matter
settled
once
for
all
it
worrying
you
i
can
see
it
again
william
stirred
uneasily
but
kate
i
ca
do
anything
i
told
you
before
i
do
believe
billy
is
nonsense
ask
but
kate
a
girl
wo
marry
against
her
will
i
do
believe
it
is
against
her
kate
honestly
honestly
i
watched
then
i
will
speak
cried
the
man
his
face
alight
if
if
you
think
anything
i
can
say
would
help
there
is
nothing
nothing
in
all
this
world
that
i
so
desire
kate
as
to
have
that
little
girl
back
home
and
of
course
that
would
do
it
she
live
there
you
why
of
course
murmured
kate
with
a
puzzled
frown
there
was
something
in
this
last
remark
of
william
that
she
did
not
quite
understand
surely
he
could
not
suppose
that
she
had
any
idea
that
after
he
had
married
billy
they
would
go
to
live
anywhere
else
she
thought
for
a
moment
she
considered
the
matter
vaguely
then
she
turned
her
attention
to
something
else
she
was
the
more
ready
to
do
this
because
she
believed
that
she
had
said
enough
for
the
present
it
was
well
to
sow
seeds
but
it
was
also
well
to
let
them
have
a
chance
to
grow
she
told
herself
hartwell
next
move
was
to
speak
to
billy
and
she
was
careful
to
do
this
at
once
so
that
she
might
pave
the
way
for
william
she
began
her
conversation
with
an
ingratiating
smile
and
the
words
well
billy
i
been
doing
a
little
detective
work
on
my
own
detective
work
yes
about
william
you
know
i
told
you
the
other
day
how
troubled
and
anxious
he
looked
to
me
well
i
found
out
what
the
what
is
it
myself
why
hartwell
what
can
you
mean
the
elder
lady
smiled
significantly
oh
it
merely
another
case
my
dear
of
heart
never
won
fair
lady
i
been
helping
on
the
faint
heart
that
but
i
do
no
i
ca
believe
you
quite
mean
that
my
dear
surely
you
must
know
how
earnestly
my
brother
william
is
longing
for
you
to
go
back
and
live
with
like
william
billy
flushed
scarlet
mrs
hartwell
certainly
no
one
could
know
better
than
yourself
why
that
is
quite
impossible
she
frowned
the
other
colored
confusedly
i
understand
of
course
what
you
mean
and
billy
i
confess
that
i
been
sorry
lots
of
times
since
that
i
spoke
as
i
did
to
you
particularly
when
i
saw
how
it
grieved
my
brother
william
to
have
you
go
away
if
i
blundered
then
i
sorry
and
perhaps
i
did
blunder
at
all
events
that
is
only
the
more
reason
now
why
i
am
so
anxious
to
do
what
i
can
to
rectify
that
old
mistake
and
plead
william
to
hartwell
blank
amazement
billy
laughed
outright
suit
she
quoted
merrily
why
hartwell
there
any
to
it
uncle
william
does
want
me
to
marry
him
indeed
he
billy
stopped
laughing
and
sat
suddenly
erect
mrs
hartwell
billy
is
it
possible
that
you
did
not
know
this
indeed
i
do
know
it
and
excuse
me
but
i
do
think
you
do
but
i
do
i
talked
with
him
and
he
very
much
in
earnest
urged
hartwell
speaking
very
rapidly
he
says
there
nothing
in
all
the
world
that
he
so
desires
and
billy
you
do
care
for
him
i
know
you
do
why
of
course
i
care
for
him
but
not
that
but
billy
think
hartwell
was
very
earnest
now
and
a
little
frightened
she
felt
that
she
must
bring
billy
to
terms
in
some
way
now
that
william
had
been
encouraged
to
put
his
fate
to
the
test
just
remember
how
good
william
has
always
been
to
you
and
think
what
you
have
been
and
may
be
if
you
only
will
in
his
lonely
life
think
of
his
great
sorrow
years
ago
think
of
this
dreary
waste
of
years
between
think
how
now
his
heart
has
turned
to
you
for
love
and
comfort
and
rest
billy
you
ca
turn
away
you
ca
find
it
in
your
heart
to
turn
away
from
that
dear
good
man
who
loves
you
so
hartwell
voice
shook
effectively
and
even
her
eyes
looked
through
tears
mentally
she
was
congratulating
herself
she
had
not
supposed
she
could
make
so
touching
an
appeal
in
the
chair
opposite
the
girl
sat
very
still
she
was
pale
and
her
eyes
showed
a
frightened
questioning
in
their
depths
for
a
long
minute
she
said
nothing
then
she
rose
dazedly
to
her
feet
mrs
hartwell
please
do
not
speak
of
this
to
any
one
she
begged
in
a
low
voice
i
i
am
taken
quite
by
surprise
i
shall
have
to
think
it
out
billy
did
not
sleep
well
that
night
always
before
her
eyes
was
the
vision
of
william
face
and
always
in
her
ears
was
the
echo
of
hartwell
words
remember
how
good
william
has
always
been
to
you
think
of
his
great
sorrow
years
ago
think
of
this
dreary
waste
of
years
between
think
how
now
his
heart
has
turned
to
you
for
love
and
comfort
and
for
a
time
billy
tossed
about
on
her
bed
trying
to
close
her
eyes
to
the
vision
and
her
ears
to
the
echo
then
finding
that
neither
was
possible
she
set
herself
earnestly
to
thinking
the
matter
out
william
loved
her
extraordinary
as
it
seemed
such
was
the
fact
hartwell
said
so
and
now
what
must
she
do
what
could
she
do
she
loved
no
one
of
that
she
was
very
sure
she
was
even
beginning
to
think
that
she
would
never
love
any
one
there
were
calderwell
cyril
bertram
to
say
nothing
of
sundry
others
who
had
loved
her
apparently
but
whom
she
could
not
love
such
being
the
case
if
she
were
indeed
incapable
of
love
herself
why
should
she
not
make
the
sacrifice
of
giving
up
her
career
her
independence
and
in
that
way
bring
this
great
joy
to
uncle
william
heart
even
as
she
said
the
uncle
william
to
herself
billy
bit
her
lip
and
realized
that
she
must
no
longer
say
uncle
william
if
she
married
him
if
she
married
the
words
startled
her
if
she
married
well
what
of
it
she
would
go
to
live
at
the
strata
of
course
and
there
would
be
cyril
and
bertram
it
might
be
awkward
and
yet
she
did
not
believe
cyril
was
in
love
with
anything
but
his
music
and
as
to
bertram
it
was
the
same
with
bertram
and
his
painting
and
he
would
soon
forget
that
he
had
ever
fancied
he
loved
her
after
that
he
would
be
simply
a
congenial
friend
and
companion
a
good
comrade
as
billy
thought
of
it
indeed
one
of
the
pleasantest
features
of
this
marriage
with
william
would
be
the
delightful
comradeship
of
her
brother
bertram
billy
dwelt
then
at
some
length
on
william
love
for
her
his
longing
for
her
presence
and
his
dreary
years
of
loneliness
and
he
was
so
good
to
her
she
recollected
he
had
always
been
good
to
her
he
was
older
to
be
sure
much
older
than
she
but
after
all
it
would
not
be
so
difficult
so
very
difficult
to
learn
to
love
him
at
all
events
whatever
happened
she
would
have
the
supreme
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
at
least
she
had
brought
into
dear
uncle
that
is
into
life
the
great
peace
and
joy
that
only
she
could
give
it
was
almost
dawn
when
billy
arrived
at
this
not
uncheerful
state
of
prospective
martyrdom
she
turned
over
then
with
a
sigh
and
settled
herself
to
sleep
she
was
relieved
that
she
had
decided
the
question
she
was
glad
that
she
knew
just
what
to
say
when
william
should
speak
he
was
a
dear
dear
man
and
she
would
not
make
it
hard
for
him
she
promised
herself
she
would
be
william
wife
chapter
xxxvi
william
meets
with
a
surprise
in
spite
of
his
sister
confident
assurance
that
the
time
was
ripe
for
him
to
speak
to
billy
william
delayed
some
days
before
broaching
the
matter
to
her
his
courage
was
not
so
good
as
it
had
been
when
he
was
talking
with
kate
it
seemed
now
as
it
always
had
a
fearsome
thing
to
try
to
hasten
on
this
love
affair
between
billy
and
bertram
he
could
not
see
in
spite
of
kate
words
that
billy
showed
unmistakable
evidence
at
all
of
being
in
love
with
his
brother
the
more
he
thought
of
it
in
fact
the
more
he
dreaded
the
carrying
out
of
his
promise
to
speak
to
his
namesake
what
should
he
say
he
asked
himself
how
could
he
word
it
he
could
not
very
well
accost
her
with
oh
billy
i
wish
you
please
hurry
up
and
marry
bertram
because
then
you
come
and
live
with
neither
could
he
plead
bertram
cause
directly
quite
probably
bertram
would
prefer
to
plead
his
own
then
too
if
billy
really
was
not
in
love
with
bertram
what
then
might
not
his
own
untimely
haste
in
the
matter
forever
put
an
end
to
the
chance
of
her
caring
for
him
it
was
indeed
a
delicate
matter
and
as
william
pondered
it
he
wished
himself
well
out
of
it
and
that
kate
had
not
spoken
but
even
as
he
formed
the
wish
william
remembered
with
a
thrill
kate
positive
assertion
that
a
word
from
him
would
do
wonders
and
that
now
was
the
time
to
utter
it
he
decided
then
that
he
would
speak
that
he
must
speak
but
that
at
the
same
time
he
would
proceed
with
a
caution
that
would
permit
a
hasty
retreat
if
he
saw
that
his
words
were
not
having
the
desired
effect
he
would
begin
with
a
frank
confession
of
his
grief
at
her
leaving
him
and
of
his
longing
for
her
return
then
very
gradually
if
wisdom
counseled
it
he
would
go
on
to
speak
of
love
for
her
and
of
his
own
hope
that
she
would
make
bertram
and
all
the
strata
glad
by
loving
him
in
return
hartwell
had
returned
to
her
western
home
before
william
found
just
the
opportunity
for
his
talk
with
billy
true
to
his
belief
that
only
hushed
voices
and
twilight
were
fitting
for
such
a
subject
he
waited
until
he
found
the
girl
early
one
evening
alone
on
her
veranda
he
noticed
that
as
he
seated
himself
at
her
side
she
flushed
a
little
and
half
started
to
rise
with
a
nervous
fluttering
of
her
hands
and
a
murmured
i
call
aunt
it
was
then
that
with
sudden
courage
he
resolved
to
speak
billy
do
go
he
said
gently
with
a
touch
of
his
hand
on
her
arm
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
i
i
have
wanted
to
say
it
for
some
why
of
of
course
stammered
the
girl
falling
back
in
her
seat
and
again
william
noticed
that
odd
fluttering
of
the
slim
little
hands
for
a
time
no
one
spoke
then
william
began
softly
his
eyes
on
the
distant
still
faintly
aglow
with
the
sunset
reflection
billy
i
want
to
tell
you
a
story
long
years
ago
there
was
a
man
who
had
a
happy
home
with
a
young
wife
and
a
tiny
baby
boy
in
it
i
could
not
begin
to
tell
you
all
the
plans
that
man
made
for
that
baby
boy
such
a
great
and
good
and
wonderful
being
that
tiny
baby
was
one
day
to
become
but
the
baby
went
away
after
a
time
and
carried
with
him
all
the
plans
and
he
never
came
back
behind
him
he
left
empty
hearts
that
ached
and
great
bare
rooms
that
seemed
always
to
be
echoing
sighs
and
sobs
and
then
one
day
such
a
few
years
after
the
young
wife
went
to
find
her
baby
and
left
the
man
all
alone
with
the
heart
that
ached
and
the
great
bare
rooms
that
echoed
sighs
and
sobs
perhaps
it
was
this
the
bareness
of
the
rooms
that
made
the
man
turn
to
his
boyish
passion
for
collecting
things
he
wanted
to
fill
those
rooms
full
full
so
that
the
sighs
and
sobs
could
not
be
heard
and
he
wanted
to
fill
his
heart
too
with
something
that
would
still
the
ache
and
he
tried
already
he
had
his
boyish
treasures
and
these
he
lined
up
in
brave
array
but
his
rooms
still
echoed
and
his
heart
still
ached
so
he
built
more
shelves
and
bought
more
cabinets
and
set
himself
to
filling
them
hoping
at
the
same
time
that
he
might
fill
all
that
dreary
waste
of
hours
outside
of
business
hours
which
once
had
been
all
too
short
to
devote
to
the
young
wife
and
the
baby
boy
one
by
one
the
years
passed
and
one
by
one
the
shelves
and
the
cabinets
were
filled
the
man
fancied
sometimes
that
he
had
succeeded
but
in
his
heart
of
hearts
he
knew
that
the
ache
was
merely
dulled
and
that
darkness
had
only
to
come
to
set
the
rooms
once
more
to
echoing
the
sighs
and
sobs
and
then
but
perhaps
you
are
tired
of
the
story
william
turned
with
questioning
eyes
no
oh
no
faltered
billy
it
is
beautiful
but
so
sad
but
the
saddest
part
is
done
i
hope
said
william
softly
let
me
tell
you
a
wonderful
thing
happened
then
suddenly
right
out
of
a
dull
gray
sky
of
hopelessness
dropped
a
little
girl
and
a
little
gray
cat
all
over
the
house
they
frolicked
filling
every
nook
and
cranny
with
laughter
and
light
and
happiness
and
then
like
magic
the
man
lost
the
ache
in
his
heart
and
the
rooms
lost
their
echoing
sighs
and
sobs
the
man
knew
then
that
never
again
could
he
hope
to
fill
his
heart
and
life
with
senseless
things
of
clay
and
metal
he
knew
that
the
one
thing
he
wanted
always
near
him
was
the
little
girl
and
he
hoped
that
he
could
keep
her
but
just
as
he
was
beginning
to
bask
in
this
new
light
it
went
out
as
suddenly
as
they
had
come
the
little
girl
and
the
gray
cat
went
away
why
the
man
did
not
know
he
knew
only
that
the
ache
had
come
back
doubly
intense
and
that
the
rooms
were
more
gloomy
than
ever
and
now
billy
william
voice
shook
a
little
it
is
for
you
to
finish
the
story
it
is
for
you
to
say
whether
that
man
heart
shall
ache
on
and
on
down
to
a
lonely
old
age
and
whether
those
rooms
shall
always
echo
the
sighs
and
sobs
of
the
and
i
will
finish
it
choked
billy
holding
out
both
her
hands
it
ache
they
echo
the
man
leaned
forward
eagerly
unbelievingly
and
caught
the
hands
in
his
own
billy
do
you
mean
it
then
you
will
come
yes
yes
i
did
know
i
did
think
i
never
supposed
it
was
like
that
of
course
i
come
and
in
a
moment
she
was
sobbing
in
his
arms
billy
breathed
william
rapturously
as
he
touched
his
lips
to
her
forehead
my
own
little
billy
it
was
a
few
minutes
later
when
billy
was
more
calm
that
william
started
to
speak
of
bertram
for
a
moment
he
had
been
tempted
not
to
mention
his
brother
now
that
his
own
point
had
been
won
so
surprisingly
quick
but
the
new
softness
in
billy
face
had
encouraged
him
and
he
did
not
like
to
let
the
occasion
pass
when
a
word
from
him
might
do
so
much
for
bertram
his
lips
parted
but
no
words
came
billy
herself
had
begun
to
speak
i
sure
i
do
know
why
i
crying
she
stammered
dabbing
her
eyes
with
her
round
moist
ball
of
a
handerchief
i
hope
when
i
your
wife
i
learn
to
be
more
but
you
know
i
am
young
and
you
have
to
be
as
once
before
at
something
billy
said
the
world
to
william
went
suddenly
mad
his
head
swam
dizzily
and
his
throat
tightened
so
that
he
could
scarcely
breathe
by
sheer
force
of
will
he
kept
his
arm
about
billy
shoulder
and
he
prayed
that
she
might
not
know
how
numb
and
cold
it
had
grown
even
then
he
thought
he
could
not
have
heard
aright
er
you
said
he
questioned
faintly
i
say
when
i
your
wife
i
hope
i
learn
to
be
more
laughed
billy
nervously
you
see
i
just
thought
i
ought
to
remind
you
that
i
am
young
and
that
you
have
to
be
william
stammered
something
a
hurried
something
he
wondered
afterward
what
it
was
that
it
must
have
been
satisfactory
to
billy
was
evident
for
she
began
laughingly
to
talk
again
what
she
said
william
scarcely
knew
though
he
was
conscious
of
making
an
occasional
vague
reply
he
was
still
floundering
in
a
hopeless
sea
of
confusion
and
dismay
his
own
desire
was
to
get
up
and
say
good
night
at
once
he
wanted
to
be
alone
to
think
he
realized
however
with
sickening
force
that
men
do
not
propose
and
run
away
if
they
are
accepted
and
he
was
accepted
he
realized
that
too
overwhelmingly
then
he
tried
to
think
how
it
had
happened
what
he
had
said
how
she
could
so
have
misunderstood
his
meaning
this
line
of
thought
he
abandoned
quickly
however
it
could
do
no
good
but
what
could
do
good
he
asked
himself
what
could
he
do
with
blinding
force
came
the
answer
he
could
do
nothing
billy
cared
for
him
billy
had
said
billy
expected
to
be
his
wife
as
if
he
could
say
to
her
now
i
beg
your
pardon
but
was
all
a
mistake
did
not
ask
you
to
marry
very
valiantly
then
william
summoned
his
wits
and
tried
to
act
his
part
he
told
himself
too
that
it
would
not
be
a
hard
one
that
he
loved
billy
dearly
and
that
he
would
try
to
make
her
happy
he
winced
a
little
at
this
thought
for
he
remembered
suddenly
how
old
he
was
as
if
he
at
his
age
were
a
fit
match
for
a
girl
of
and
then
he
looked
at
billy
the
girl
was
plainly
nervous
there
was
a
deep
flush
on
her
cheeks
and
a
brilliant
sparkle
in
her
eyes
she
was
talking
rapidly
almost
incoherently
at
times
and
her
voice
was
tremulous
frequent
little
embarrassed
laughs
punctuated
her
sentences
and
her
fingers
toyed
with
everything
that
came
within
reach
some
time
before
she
had
sprung
to
her
feet
and
had
turned
on
the
electric
lights
and
when
she
came
back
she
had
not
taken
her
old
position
at
side
but
had
seated
herself
in
a
chair
near
by
all
of
which
according
to
william
eyes
meant
the
maidenly
shyness
of
a
girl
who
has
just
said
yes
to
the
man
she
loves
william
went
home
that
night
in
a
daze
to
himself
he
said
that
he
had
gone
out
in
search
of
a
daughter
and
had
come
back
with
a
wife
chapter
xxxvii
william
brother
it
was
decided
that
for
the
present
the
engagement
should
not
be
known
outside
the
family
the
wedding
would
not
take
place
immediately
william
said
and
it
was
just
as
well
to
keep
the
matter
to
themselves
until
plans
were
a
little
more
definite
the
members
of
the
family
were
told
at
once
aunt
hannah
said
oh
my
grief
and
conscience
three
times
and
made
matters
scarcely
better
by
adding
apologetically
oh
of
course
it
all
right
it
all
right
only
she
did
not
finish
her
sentence
and
william
who
had
told
her
the
news
did
not
know
whether
he
would
have
been
more
or
less
pleased
if
she
had
finished
it
cyril
received
the
information
moodily
and
lapsed
at
once
into
a
fit
of
abstraction
from
which
he
roused
himself
hardly
enough
to
offer
perfunctory
congratulations
and
best
wishes
billy
was
a
little
puzzled
at
cyril
behavior
she
had
been
sure
for
some
time
that
cyril
had
ceased
to
care
specially
for
her
even
if
he
ever
did
fancy
that
he
loved
her
she
had
hoped
to
keep
him
for
a
friend
but
of
late
she
had
been
forced
to
question
even
his
friendliness
he
had
in
fact
gone
back
almost
to
his
old
reserve
and
taciturn
aloofness
from
the
west
in
response
to
william
news
of
the
engagement
came
a
cordially
pleased
note
in
kate
scrawling
handwriting
kate
indeed
seemed
to
be
the
only
member
of
the
family
who
was
genuinely
delighted
with
the
coming
marriage
as
to
bertram
bertram
appeared
to
have
aged
years
in
a
single
night
so
drawn
and
white
was
his
face
the
morning
after
william
had
told
him
his
plans
william
had
dreaded
most
of
all
to
tell
bertram
he
was
very
sure
that
bertram
himself
cared
for
billy
and
it
was
doubly
hard
because
in
william
own
mind
was
a
strong
conviction
that
the
younger
man
was
decidedly
the
one
for
her
realizing
however
that
bertram
must
be
told
william
chose
a
time
for
the
telling
when
bertram
was
smoking
in
his
den
in
the
twilight
with
his
face
half
hidden
from
sight
bertram
said
little
very
little
that
night
but
in
the
morning
he
went
straight
to
billy
billy
was
shocked
she
had
never
seen
the
smiling
debonair
bertram
like
this
billy
is
this
true
he
demanded
the
dull
misery
in
his
voice
told
billy
that
he
knew
the
answer
before
he
asked
the
question
yes
yes
but
bertram
please
please
do
take
it
like
this
she
implored
how
would
you
have
me
take
it
why
just
just
sensibly
you
know
i
told
you
that
that
the
other
never
could
be
i
know
you
said
so
but
i
believed
but
i
told
you
i
did
not
love
you
that
bertram
winced
he
rose
to
his
feet
abruptly
i
know
you
did
billy
i
a
fool
of
course
to
think
that
i
could
ever
change
it
i
should
have
come
here
either
this
morning
but
i
had
to
his
face
as
he
held
out
his
hand
was
tragic
with
renunciation
why
bertram
you
are
going
now
like
this
cried
the
girl
you
just
come
the
man
turned
almost
impatiently
and
do
you
think
i
can
stay
like
this
billy
wo
you
say
he
asked
in
a
softer
voice
again
with
outstretched
hand
billy
shook
her
head
she
ignored
the
hand
and
resolutely
backed
away
no
not
like
that
you
are
angry
with
me
she
grieved
besides
you
make
it
sound
as
if
if
you
were
going
i
am
going
bertram
there
was
terror
as
well
as
dismay
in
billy
voice
again
the
man
turned
sharply
billy
why
are
you
making
this
thing
so
hard
for
me
he
asked
in
despair
ca
you
see
that
i
must
go
indeed
i
ca
and
you
must
go
either
there
is
any
reason
why
you
should
urged
billy
talking
very
fast
and
working
her
fingers
nervously
things
are
just
the
same
as
they
were
before
for
you
just
going
to
marry
william
but
i
was
ever
going
to
marry
you
so
that
does
change
things
any
for
you
do
you
see
why
bertram
you
must
go
away
there
wo
be
anybody
left
cyril
going
next
week
you
know
and
if
you
go
there
wo
be
anybody
left
but
william
and
me
bertram
you
must
go
do
you
see
i
should
feel
lost
without
you
billy
was
almost
crying
now
bertram
looked
up
quickly
an
odd
change
had
come
to
his
face
for
a
moment
he
gazed
silently
into
billy
agitated
countenance
then
he
asked
in
a
low
voice
billy
did
you
think
that
after
you
and
william
were
married
i
should
still
continue
to
live
at
the
strata
why
of
course
you
will
cried
the
girl
indignantly
why
bertram
you
be
my
brother
then
my
real
brother
and
one
of
the
very
chiefest
things
i
anticipating
when
i
go
there
to
live
is
the
good
times
you
and
i
will
have
together
when
i
william
wife
bertram
drew
in
his
breath
audibly
and
caught
his
lower
lip
between
his
teeth
with
an
abrupt
movement
he
turned
his
back
and
walked
to
the
window
for
a
full
minute
he
stayed
there
watched
by
the
amazed
displeased
eyes
of
the
girl
when
he
came
back
he
sat
down
quietly
in
the
chair
facing
billy
his
countenance
was
grave
and
his
eyes
were
a
little
troubled
but
the
haggard
look
of
misery
was
quite
gone
billy
he
began
gently
you
must
forgive
my
saying
this
but
are
you
quite
sure
you
love
william
billy
flushed
with
anger
you
have
no
right
to
ask
such
a
question
of
course
i
love
of
course
you
do
we
all
love
william
william
is
in
fact
a
most
lovable
man
but
william
wife
should
perhaps
love
him
a
little
differently
from
all
of
and
she
will
certainly
retorted
the
girl
with
a
quick
lifting
of
her
chin
bertram
i
do
think
you
have
any
right
to
to
make
such
and
i
wo
make
them
any
more
replied
bertram
gravely
i
just
wanted
you
to
make
sure
that
you
i
shall
make
sure
and
i
shall
know
said
billy
firmly
so
firmly
that
it
sounded
almost
as
if
she
were
trying
to
convince
herself
as
well
as
others
there
was
a
long
pause
then
the
man
asked
diffidently
and
so
you
are
very
sure
that
that
you
want
me
to
stay
indeed
i
do
besides
do
you
remember
there
are
all
my
people
to
be
entertained
they
must
be
taken
to
places
and
given
motor
rides
and
picnics
you
told
me
last
week
that
you
love
to
help
me
but
of
course
if
you
do
want
to
but
i
do
want
to
cried
bertram
heartily
a
gleam
of
the
old
cheerfulness
springing
to
his
eyes
i
dying
to
the
girl
looked
up
with
quick
distrust
for
a
moment
she
eyed
him
with
bent
brows
to
her
mind
he
had
gone
back
to
his
old
airy
hopeful
he
was
once
more
only
she
hesitated
then
said
with
stern
decision
bertram
you
know
i
want
you
and
you
must
know
that
i
delighted
to
have
you
drop
this
silly
notion
of
going
away
but
if
this
quick
change
means
that
you
are
staying
with
any
idea
that
that
shall
change
then
then
you
must
go
but
if
you
will
stay
as
william
brother
then
i
be
more
than
glad
to
have
i
stay
as
william
brother
agreed
bertram
and
billy
did
not
notice
the
quick
indrawing
of
his
breath
nor
the
close
shutting
of
his
lips
after
the
words
were
spoken
chapter
xxxviii
the
engagement
of
two
by
the
middle
of
july
the
routine
of
billy
days
was
well
established
marie
had
been
for
a
week
a
welcome
addition
to
the
family
and
she
was
proving
to
be
of
invaluable
aid
in
entertaining
billy
guests
the
overworked
widow
and
the
little
keeper
from
the
west
end
were
enjoying
billy
hospitality
now
and
just
to
look
at
their
beaming
countenances
was
an
inspiration
billy
said
cyril
had
gone
abroad
aunt
hannah
was
spending
a
week
at
the
north
shore
with
friends
bertram
true
to
his
promise
was
playing
the
gallant
to
billy
guests
and
so
assiduous
was
he
in
his
attentions
that
billy
at
last
remonstrated
with
him
but
i
did
mean
them
to
take
all
your
time
she
protested
do
they
like
it
do
they
see
too
much
of
me
he
demanded
no
no
they
love
it
of
course
you
must
know
that
nobody
else
could
give
such
beautiful
times
as
you
given
us
but
it
yourself
thinking
of
you
giving
up
all
your
time
besides
i
did
mean
to
keep
you
here
all
summer
of
course
you
always
go
away
some
you
know
for
a
but
i
having
a
vacation
here
doing
this
laughed
bertram
i
sure
i
getting
sea
air
down
to
the
beaches
and
mountain
air
out
to
the
blue
hills
and
as
for
excitement
if
you
can
find
anything
more
wildly
exciting
than
it
was
yesterday
when
miss
marie
and
i
took
the
widow
and
the
spinster
lady
on
the
just
show
it
to
me
all
billy
laughed
they
told
me
about
it
marie
in
particular
she
said
you
were
lovely
to
them
and
let
them
do
every
single
thing
they
wanted
to
and
that
half
an
hour
after
they
got
there
they
were
like
two
children
let
out
of
school
dear
me
i
wish
i
gone
i
never
stay
at
home
that
i
do
miss
something
she
finished
regretfully
bertram
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
it
and
that
you
want
i
fancy
you
get
enough
before
the
week
is
out
he
sighed
laughingly
they
said
they
like
to
go
there
please
when
i
asked
them
what
we
should
do
next
what
surprises
me
is
that
they
like
such
things
such
things
when
i
first
saw
them
and
sitting
in
your
little
room
here
i
thought
i
should
never
dare
offer
them
anything
more
wildly
exciting
than
a
church
service
or
a
lecture
on
psychology
with
perhaps
a
band
concert
hinted
at
provided
the
band
could
be
properly
instructed
beforehand
as
to
tempo
and
selections
but
now
really
billy
why
do
you
suppose
they
have
taken
such
a
fancy
to
these
kiddish
stunts
those
two
staid
women
billy
laughed
but
her
eyes
softened
i
do
know
unless
it
because
all
their
lives
they
been
tied
to
such
dead
monotony
that
just
the
exhilaration
of
motion
is
bliss
to
them
but
you
wo
always
have
to
risk
your
neck
and
your
temper
in
this
fashion
bertram
next
week
my
little
couple
from
south
boston
comes
she
adores
pictures
and
stuffed
animals
you
have
to
do
the
museums
with
her
then
there
little
crippled
tommy
he
be
perfectly
contented
if
you
put
him
down
where
he
can
hear
the
band
play
and
all
you
have
to
do
when
that
one
stops
is
to
pilot
him
to
the
next
one
this
is
good
of
you
bertram
and
i
do
thank
you
for
it
finished
billy
fervently
just
as
marie
the
widow
and
the
spinster
lady
entered
the
room
billy
told
herself
these
days
that
she
was
very
happy
very
happy
indeed
was
she
not
engaged
to
a
good
man
and
did
she
not
also
have
it
in
her
power
to
make
the
long
summer
days
a
pleasure
to
many
people
the
fact
that
she
had
to
tell
herself
that
she
was
happy
in
order
to
convince
herself
that
she
was
so
did
not
occur
to
billy
yet
not
long
after
marie
arrived
billy
told
her
of
the
engagement
william
was
at
the
house
very
frequently
and
owing
to
the
intimacy
of
relationship
with
the
family
billy
decided
to
tell
her
how
matters
stood
marie
reception
of
the
news
was
somewhat
surprising
first
she
looked
frightened
to
william
you
are
engaged
to
william
why
but
i
thought
surely
it
was
do
you
mean
cyril
no
i
do
laughed
billy
and
certainly
i
ought
to
and
you
do
care
for
him
i
hope
not
if
i
going
to
marry
so
light
was
billy
voice
and
manner
that
marie
dared
one
more
question
and
he
does
care
for
you
i
hope
not
if
william
is
going
to
marry
me
laughed
billy
again
breathed
marie
with
an
odd
intonation
of
relief
then
glad
so
glad
and
i
hope
you
be
very
very
happy
billy
looked
into
marie
glowing
face
and
was
pleased
there
seemed
to
be
so
few
so
very
few
faces
into
which
she
had
looked
and
found
entire
approbation
of
her
engagement
to
william
billy
saw
a
great
deal
of
william
now
he
was
always
kind
and
considerate
and
he
tried
to
help
her
entertain
her
guests
but
billy
grateful
as
she
was
to
him
for
his
efforts
was
relieved
when
he
resigned
his
place
to
bertram
bertram
did
indeed
know
so
much
better
how
to
do
it
william
tried
to
help
her
too
about
training
her
vines
and
rosebushes
but
of
course
even
in
this
he
could
not
be
expected
to
show
quite
the
interest
that
bertram
manifested
in
every
green
shoot
and
opening
bud
for
he
had
not
helped
her
plant
them
as
bertram
had
billy
was
a
little
troubled
sometimes
that
she
did
not
feel
more
at
ease
with
william
she
thought
it
natural
that
she
should
feel
a
little
diffident
with
him
in
the
face
of
his
sudden
change
from
an
uncle
to
an
accepted
lover
but
she
did
not
see
why
she
should
be
afraid
of
him
yet
she
was
she
owned
that
to
herself
unhappily
and
he
was
so
good
she
owned
that
too
he
seemed
not
to
have
a
thought
in
the
world
but
for
her
comfort
and
happiness
and
there
was
no
end
to
the
tactful
little
things
he
was
always
doing
for
her
pleasure
he
seemed
also
to
have
divined
that
she
did
not
like
to
be
kissed
and
caressed
and
only
occasionally
did
he
kiss
her
and
then
it
was
merely
a
sort
of
fatherly
salute
on
her
forehead
for
which
consideration
billy
was
grateful
billy
decided
that
she
would
not
like
to
be
kissed
on
the
lips
after
some
days
of
puzzling
over
the
matter
billy
concluded
that
it
was
that
caused
all
the
trouble
with
william
she
was
if
she
could
only
forget
that
she
was
some
day
to
be
william
wife
the
old
delightful
comradeship
would
return
and
she
would
be
at
ease
again
with
him
in
time
after
she
had
become
accustomed
to
the
idea
of
marriage
it
would
not
so
confuse
her
of
course
she
loved
him
dearly
and
she
wanted
to
make
him
happy
but
for
the
present
just
while
she
was
getting
used
to
things
she
would
try
to
forget
sometimes
that
she
was
going
to
be
william
wife
billy
was
happier
now
she
was
always
happier
after
she
had
thought
things
out
to
her
own
satisfaction
she
turned
with
new
zest
to
the
entertainment
of
her
guests
and
with
bertram
she
planned
many
delightful
trips
for
their
pleasure
bertram
was
a
great
comfort
to
her
these
days
never
in
word
or
look
could
she
see
that
he
overstepped
the
role
which
he
had
promised
to
play
william
brother
billy
went
back
to
her
music
too
a
new
melody
was
running
through
her
head
and
she
longed
to
put
it
on
paper
already
her
first
little
group
of
songs
had
found
friends
and
billy
to
a
very
modest
extent
was
beginning
to
taste
the
sweets
of
fame
thus
by
all
these
interests
did
billy
try
to
get
used
to
chapter
xxxix
a
little
piece
of
paper
of
all
billy
guests
marie
was
very
plainly
the
happiest
she
was
a
permanent
guest
it
is
true
while
the
others
came
for
only
a
week
or
two
at
a
time
but
it
was
not
this
billy
decided
that
had
brought
so
brilliant
a
sparkle
to
marie
eyes
so
joyous
a
laugh
to
her
lips
the
joyousness
was
all
the
more
noticeable
because
heretofore
marie
while
very
sweet
had
been
also
sad
her
big
blue
eyes
had
always
carried
a
haunting
shadow
and
her
step
had
lacked
the
spring
belonging
to
youth
and
happiness
certainly
billy
had
never
seen
her
like
this
before
verily
marie
she
teased
one
day
have
you
found
an
exhaustless
supply
of
stockings
to
mend
or
a
pudding
to
make
which
why
what
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
i
was
only
wondering
just
what
had
brought
that
new
light
to
your
is
there
a
new
light
there
certainly
it
must
be
because
i
so
happy
then
sighed
marie
because
so
good
to
is
that
all
is
that
enough
marie
tone
was
evasive
billy
shook
her
head
mischievously
marie
what
is
it
it
nothing
really
it
nothing
protested
marie
hurrying
out
of
the
room
with
a
nervous
laugh
billy
frowned
she
was
suspicious
before
she
was
sure
now
in
less
than
twelve
hours
time
came
her
opportunity
she
was
alone
again
with
marie
marie
who
is
he
she
asked
abruptly
he
who
the
man
who
is
to
wear
the
stockings
and
eat
the
the
little
music
teacher
flushed
very
red
but
she
managed
to
display
something
that
might
pass
for
surprise
billy
come
dear
coaxed
billy
winningly
tell
me
about
it
i
so
interested
but
there
is
anything
to
tell
really
there
who
is
he
he
is
anybody
that
is
he
does
know
he
anybody
amended
marie
billy
laughed
softly
oh
does
he
has
he
ever
shown
that
he
cared
no
that
is
perhaps
he
has
only
i
thought
then
that
it
was
another
another
girl
so
there
another
girl
in
the
case
yes
i
mean
no
corrected
marie
suddenly
beginning
to
realize
what
she
was
saying
really
it
was
anything
it
is
anything
she
protested
murmured
billy
archly
oh
i
getting
on
some
he
did
show
once
that
he
cared
but
you
thought
it
was
another
girl
and
you
coldly
looked
the
other
way
now
there
is
any
other
girl
you
find
and
marie
tell
me
the
rest
marie
shook
her
head
emphatically
and
pulled
herself
gently
away
from
billy
grasp
no
no
please
she
begged
it
really
is
anything
i
sure
imagining
it
all
she
cried
as
she
ran
away
during
the
days
that
followed
billy
speculated
not
a
little
on
story
and
wondered
interestedly
who
the
man
might
be
she
questioned
marie
once
again
but
the
girl
would
tell
nothing
more
and
indeed
billy
was
so
occupied
with
her
own
perplexities
that
she
had
little
time
for
those
of
other
people
to
herself
billy
was
forced
to
own
that
she
was
not
getting
used
to
she
was
still
with
william
she
could
not
forget
that
she
was
one
day
to
be
his
wife
she
could
not
bring
back
the
dear
old
freedom
of
comradeship
with
him
billy
was
alarmed
now
she
had
begun
to
ask
herself
searching
questions
what
should
she
do
if
never
never
should
she
get
used
to
the
idea
of
marrying
william
how
could
she
marry
him
if
he
was
still
uncle
william
and
never
her
dear
lover
in
her
eyes
why
had
she
not
been
wise
enough
and
brave
enough
to
tell
him
in
the
first
place
that
she
was
not
at
all
sure
that
she
loved
him
but
that
she
would
try
to
do
so
then
when
she
had
tried
as
she
had
now
and
failed
she
could
have
told
him
honestly
the
truth
and
it
would
not
have
been
so
great
a
shock
to
him
as
it
must
be
now
if
she
should
tell
him
billy
had
remorsefully
come
to
the
conclusion
that
she
could
never
love
any
man
well
enough
to
marry
him
when
one
day
so
small
a
thing
as
a
piece
of
paper
fluttered
into
her
vision
and
showed
her
the
fallacy
of
that
idea
it
was
a
of
note
paper
and
it
blew
from
marie
balcony
to
the
lawn
below
billy
found
it
there
later
and
as
she
picked
it
up
her
eyes
fell
on
a
single
name
in
marie
handwriting
inscribed
half
a
dozen
times
as
if
the
writer
had
musingly
accompanied
her
thoughts
with
her
pen
and
the
name
was
marie
for
a
moment
billy
stared
at
the
name
perplexedly
then
in
a
flash
came
the
remembrance
of
marie
words
and
billy
breathed
henshaw
the
man
bertram
billy
dropped
the
paper
then
and
fled
in
her
own
room
behind
locked
doors
she
sat
down
to
think
bertram
it
was
he
for
whom
marie
cared
her
bertram
and
then
it
came
to
billy
with
staggering
force
that
he
was
not
her
bertram
at
all
he
never
could
be
her
bertram
now
he
was
marie
billy
was
frightened
then
so
fierce
was
this
strange
new
something
that
rose
within
her
this
overpowering
something
that
seemed
to
blot
out
all
the
world
and
leave
only
bertram
she
knew
then
that
it
had
always
been
bertram
to
whom
she
had
turned
though
she
had
been
blind
to
the
cause
of
that
turning
always
her
plans
had
included
him
always
she
had
been
the
happiest
in
his
presence
never
had
she
pictured
him
anywhere
else
but
at
her
side
certainly
never
had
she
pictured
him
as
the
devoted
lover
of
another
woman
and
she
had
not
known
what
it
all
meant
poor
blind
child
that
she
was
very
resolutely
now
billy
set
herself
to
looking
matters
squarely
in
the
face
she
understood
it
quite
well
all
summer
marie
and
bertram
had
been
thrown
together
no
wonder
marie
had
fallen
in
love
with
bertram
and
that
he
billy
thought
she
comprehended
now
why
bertram
had
found
it
so
easy
for
the
last
few
weeks
to
be
william
brother
she
of
course
had
been
the
other
girl
whom
marie
had
once
feared
that
the
man
loved
it
was
all
so
clear
so
woefully
clear
with
an
aching
heart
billy
asked
herself
what
now
was
to
be
done
for
herself
turn
whichever
way
she
could
she
could
see
nothing
but
unhappiness
she
determined
therefore
with
spartan
fortitude
that
to
no
one
else
would
she
bring
equal
unhappiness
she
would
be
silent
bertram
and
marie
loved
each
other
that
matter
was
settled
as
to
william
billy
thought
of
the
story
william
had
told
her
of
his
lonely
life
of
the
plea
he
had
made
to
her
and
her
heart
ached
whatever
happened
william
must
be
made
happy
william
must
not
be
told
her
promise
to
william
must
be
kept
chapter
xl
william
pays
a
visit
before
september
passed
all
billy
friends
said
that
her
task
had
been
too
hard
for
her
in
no
other
way
could
they
account
for
the
sad
change
that
had
come
to
her
undeniably
billy
looked
really
ill
always
slender
she
was
now
her
eyes
had
found
again
the
wistful
appeal
of
her
girlhood
only
now
they
carried
something
that
was
almost
fear
as
well
the
had
gone
from
her
cheeks
and
pathetic
little
hollows
had
appeared
making
the
round
young
chin
below
look
almost
pointed
certainly
billy
did
seem
to
be
late
in
september
william
went
west
on
business
incidentally
he
called
to
see
his
sister
kate
well
and
how
is
everybody
asked
kate
cheerily
after
the
greetings
were
over
william
sighed
well
to
me
kate
is
pretty
badly
off
we
worried
about
billy
you
do
mean
she
sick
why
she
always
been
the
picture
of
health
i
know
she
has
but
she
is
what
the
trouble
that
what
we
do
you
had
the
doctor
of
course
two
or
three
of
them
though
much
against
billy
will
but
they
did
help
what
did
they
say
they
could
find
nothing
except
perhaps
a
little
temporary
stomach
trouble
or
something
of
that
kind
which
they
all
agreed
was
no
just
cause
for
her
present
but
what
did
they
say
it
was
why
they
said
it
seemed
like
nervousness
or
as
if
something
was
troubling
her
they
asked
if
she
were
under
some
sort
of
well
is
she
does
anything
trouble
her
not
that
i
know
of
anyhow
if
there
is
anything
none
of
us
can
find
out
what
it
kate
frowned
she
threw
a
quick
look
into
her
brother
face
william
she
began
hesitatingly
forgive
me
but
billy
is
quite
happy
in
her
engagement
i
the
man
flushed
painfully
and
sighed
i
thought
of
that
of
course
in
fact
it
was
the
first
thing
i
did
think
of
i
even
began
to
watch
her
rather
closely
and
once
i
questioned
her
a
what
did
she
say
she
seemed
so
frightened
and
distressed
that
i
did
say
much
myself
i
could
i
had
but
just
begun
when
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
and
she
asked
me
in
a
frightened
little
voice
if
she
had
done
anything
to
displease
me
anything
to
make
me
unhappy
and
she
seemed
so
anxious
and
grieved
and
dismayed
that
i
should
even
question
her
that
i
had
to
what
has
she
done
this
summer
where
has
she
been
she
has
been
anywhere
did
i
write
you
she
kept
open
house
for
a
lot
of
her
less
fortunate
friends
a
sort
of
vacation
home
you
know
and
and
i
must
say
she
given
them
a
world
of
happiness
but
was
that
hard
for
her
it
did
seem
to
be
she
appeared
to
enjoy
it
immensely
particularly
at
first
of
course
she
had
plenty
of
help
and
that
wonderful
little
miss
hawthorn
has
been
a
host
in
herself
they
all
gone
now
anyway
except
miss
but
billy
must
have
had
the
care
and
the
perhaps
to
a
certain
extent
though
not
much
after
all
you
see
bertram
too
has
given
up
his
summer
to
them
and
has
been
playing
the
devoted
escort
to
the
whole
bunch
indeed
for
the
last
few
weeks
of
it
since
billy
began
to
seem
so
ill
he
and
miss
hawthorn
have
schemed
to
take
all
the
care
from
billy
and
they
have
done
the
whole
thing
but
what
has
billy
done
to
make
her
like
this
i
do
know
she
done
lots
for
me
in
all
sorts
of
ways
cataloguing
my
curios
you
know
and
going
with
me
to
hunt
up
things
in
fact
she
seems
the
happiest
when
she
is
doing
something
for
me
it
come
to
be
a
sort
of
mania
with
her
i
afraid
to
do
something
for
me
kate
really
worried
what
do
you
suppose
is
the
matter
kate
shook
her
head
the
puzzled
frown
had
come
back
to
her
face
i
ca
imagine
she
began
slowly
of
course
when
i
told
her
you
loved
her
and
when
you
told
her
exploded
the
usually
william
with
sudden
sharpness
when
i
told
her
that
you
loved
her
william
you
see
i
william
sprang
to
his
feet
told
her
that
i
loved
her
he
cried
aghast
good
heavens
kate
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
told
her
why
and
may
i
ask
where
you
got
your
information
why
william
henshaw
what
a
question
i
got
it
from
yourself
of
course
defended
kate
from
me
william
face
expressed
sheer
amazement
certainly
on
that
drive
when
i
was
east
in
june
returned
kate
with
dignity
you
evidently
have
forgotten
it
but
i
have
not
you
told
me
very
frankly
how
much
you
thought
of
her
and
how
you
longed
to
have
her
back
there
with
you
but
that
she
did
seem
to
be
ready
to
come
i
was
sorry
for
you
and
i
wanted
to
do
something
to
help
particularly
as
it
might
have
been
my
fault
partly
that
she
went
away
in
the
first
william
lifted
his
head
what
do
you
mean
why
nothing
only
that
i
i
told
her
a
little
of
how
how
upsetting
her
arrival
had
been
to
everything
and
of
how
much
you
had
done
for
her
and
put
yourself
out
i
said
it
so
she
appreciate
things
of
course
but
she
took
it
quite
differently
from
what
i
had
intended
she
should
take
it
and
seemed
quite
cut
up
about
it
then
she
went
away
in
that
wily
impulsive
william
bit
his
lip
but
he
did
not
speak
kate
was
plunging
on
feverishly
and
in
the
face
of
the
greater
revelation
he
let
the
lesser
one
drop
and
so
that
why
i
was
particularly
anxious
to
bring
things
around
right
again
continued
kate
and
that
why
i
spoke
i
thought
seen
how
things
were
and
on
the
drive
i
said
so
then
is
when
i
advised
you
to
speak
to
billy
but
you
declared
that
billy
was
ready
and
that
you
could
make
a
girl
marry
against
her
will
now
do
you
recollect
it
a
great
light
of
understanding
broke
over
william
face
he
started
to
speak
but
something
evidently
stayed
the
words
on
his
lips
with
controlled
deliberation
he
turned
and
sat
down
then
he
said
kate
will
you
kindly
tell
me
just
what
you
did
do
why
i
did
do
so
very
much
i
just
tried
to
help
that
all
after
i
talked
with
you
and
advised
you
to
ask
billy
right
away
to
marry
you
i
went
to
her
i
thought
she
cared
for
you
already
anyway
but
i
just
wanted
to
tell
her
how
very
much
it
was
to
you
and
so
sort
of
pave
the
way
and
now
comes
the
part
that
i
started
to
tell
you
a
little
while
ago
when
you
caught
me
up
so
sharply
i
was
going
to
say
that
when
i
told
billy
this
she
appeared
to
be
surprised
and
almost
frightened
you
see
she
had
known
you
cared
for
her
after
all
and
so
i
had
a
chance
to
help
and
make
it
plain
to
her
how
you
did
love
her
so
that
when
you
spoke
everything
would
be
all
right
there
that
all
you
see
i
did
do
so
very
very
much
groaned
william
starting
to
his
feet
great
scott
why
william
what
do
you
mean
where
are
you
going
i
going
to
billy
retorted
william
with
slow
distinctness
and
i
going
to
try
to
get
there
before
you
can
and
with
this
extraordinary
shot
for
william
he
left
the
house
william
went
to
billy
as
fast
as
steam
could
carry
him
he
found
her
in
her
little
listlessly
watching
with
aunt
hannah
the
game
of
chess
that
bertram
and
marie
were
playing
billy
you
poor
dear
child
come
here
he
said
abruptly
as
soon
as
the
excitement
of
his
unexpected
arrival
had
passed
i
want
to
talk
to
and
he
led
the
way
to
the
veranda
which
he
knew
would
be
silent
and
deserted
to
talk
to
me
murmured
billy
as
she
wonderingly
came
to
his
side
a
startled
questioning
in
her
wide
dark
eyes
chapter
xli
the
crooked
made
straight
william
did
not
the
house
after
his
talk
with
billy
on
the
veranda
i
will
go
down
the
steps
and
around
by
the
rose
garden
to
the
street
dear
he
said
i
rather
not
go
in
now
just
make
my
adieus
please
and
say
that
i
could
stay
any
longer
and
now
his
eyes
as
they
looked
down
at
her
were
moist
and
very
tender
his
lips
trembled
a
little
but
they
smiled
and
there
was
a
look
of
peace
and
joy
on
his
face
billy
too
was
smiling
though
wistfully
the
frightened
questioning
had
gone
from
her
eyes
leaving
only
infinite
tenderness
you
are
sure
it
it
is
all
right
now
she
stammered
very
sure
little
girl
and
it
the
first
time
it
has
been
right
for
weeks
billy
that
was
very
dear
of
you
and
i
love
you
for
it
but
think
how
near
how
perilously
near
you
came
to
lifelong
misery
but
i
thought
you
wanted
me
so
much
she
smiled
shyly
and
i
did
and
i
do
for
a
daughter
you
do
doubt
that
now
no
oh
no
laughed
billy
softly
and
to
her
face
came
a
happy
look
of
relief
as
she
finished
and
i
be
so
glad
to
be
the
daughter
for
some
minutes
after
the
man
had
gone
billy
stood
by
the
steps
where
he
had
left
her
she
was
still
there
when
bertram
came
to
the
veranda
door
and
spoke
to
her
billy
i
saw
william
go
by
the
window
so
i
knew
you
were
alone
may
i
speak
to
you
the
girl
turned
with
a
start
why
of
course
what
is
it
but
i
thought
you
were
playing
where
is
marie
the
game
is
finished
besides
billy
why
are
you
always
asking
me
lately
where
marie
is
as
if
i
were
her
keeper
or
she
mine
he
demanded
with
a
touch
of
nervous
irritation
why
nothing
bertram
smiled
billy
a
little
wearily
only
that
you
were
playing
together
a
few
minutes
ago
and
i
wondered
where
she
had
few
minutes
ago
echoed
bertram
with
sudden
bitterness
evidently
the
time
passed
swiftly
with
you
billy
william
was
out
here
more
than
an
why
bertram
yes
i
know
i
no
business
to
say
that
of
course
sighed
the
man
but
billy
that
why
i
came
out
because
i
must
speak
to
you
this
once
wo
you
come
and
sit
down
please
he
implored
despairingly
why
bertram
murmured
billy
again
faintly
as
she
turned
toward
the
corner
and
sat
down
her
eyes
were
startled
a
swift
color
had
come
to
her
cheeks
billy
began
the
man
in
a
sternly
controlled
voice
please
let
me
speak
this
once
and
do
try
to
stop
me
you
may
think
for
a
moment
that
it
disloyal
to
william
if
you
listen
but
it
is
there
this
much
due
to
me
that
you
let
me
speak
now
billy
i
ca
stand
it
i
tried
but
it
no
use
i
got
to
go
away
and
it
right
that
i
should
i
not
the
only
one
that
thinks
so
either
marie
does
marie
yes
i
talked
it
all
over
with
her
she
known
for
a
long
time
how
it
been
with
me
how
i
cared
for
marie
you
told
marie
that
gasped
billy
yes
surely
you
do
mind
marie
knowing
went
on
bertram
dejectedly
and
she
been
so
good
to
me
and
tried
to
help
bertram
was
not
looking
at
billy
now
if
he
had
been
he
would
have
seen
the
incredulous
joy
come
into
her
face
his
eyes
were
moodily
fixed
on
the
floor
and
so
billy
i
come
to
tell
you
i
going
away
he
continued
after
a
moment
i
got
to
go
i
thought
once
when
i
first
talked
with
you
of
william
that
you
did
know
your
own
heart
that
you
did
really
care
for
him
i
was
even
fool
enough
to
think
that
that
it
would
be
i
to
whom
you
turn
some
day
and
so
i
stayed
but
i
stayed
honorably
billy
you
know
that
you
know
that
i
have
once
forgotten
not
once
that
i
was
only
william
brother
i
promised
you
i
be
that
and
i
have
been
have
i
billy
nodded
silently
her
face
was
turned
away
but
billy
i
ca
do
it
any
longer
i
got
to
ask
for
my
promise
back
and
then
of
course
i
ca
but
you
you
do
have
to
go
away
murmured
the
girl
faintly
bertram
sprang
to
his
feet
his
face
was
white
billy
he
cried
standing
tall
and
straight
before
her
billy
i
love
every
touch
of
your
hand
every
glance
of
your
eye
every
word
that
falls
from
your
lips
do
you
think
i
can
stay
now
i
want
my
promise
back
when
i
no
longer
william
brother
then
i
go
but
you
do
have
to
have
it
back
that
is
you
do
have
to
have
it
at
all
stammered
billy
flushing
adorably
she
too
was
on
her
feet
now
billy
what
do
you
mean
do
you
see
i
i
have
turned
she
faltered
breathlessly
holding
out
both
her
hands
even
then
in
spite
of
the
great
light
that
leaped
to
his
eyes
bertram
advanced
only
a
single
step
but
william
he
questioned
unbelievingly
it
was
a
mistake
just
as
you
thought
we
know
now
both
of
us
we
do
either
of
us
care
for
the
other
that
way
and
bertram
i
think
it
has
been
you
all
the
time
only
i
did
know
billy
billy
choked
bertram
in
a
voice
shaken
with
emotion
he
opened
his
arms
then
wide
and
billy
walked
straight
into
them
chapter
xlii
the
end
of
the
story
it
was
two
days
after
billy
new
happiness
had
come
to
her
that
cyril
came
home
he
went
very
soon
to
see
billy
the
girl
was
surprised
at
the
change
in
his
appearance
he
had
grown
thin
and
haggard
looking
and
his
eyes
were
somber
he
moved
restlessly
about
the
room
for
a
time
finally
seating
himself
at
the
piano
and
letting
his
fingers
slip
from
one
mournful
little
melody
to
another
then
with
a
discordant
crash
he
turned
billy
do
you
think
any
girl
would
marry
me
he
demanded
why
cyril
there
now
please
do
begin
that
he
begged
fretfully
i
realize
of
course
that
i
a
very
unlikely
subject
for
matrimony
you
made
me
understand
that
clearly
enough
last
winter
last
winter
cyril
raised
his
eyebrows
oh
i
came
to
you
for
a
little
encouragement
and
to
make
a
confession
he
said
i
made
the
confession
but
i
did
get
the
billy
changed
color
she
thought
she
knew
what
he
meant
but
at
the
same
time
she
could
understand
why
he
should
wish
to
refer
to
that
conversation
now
a
confession
she
repeated
hesitatingly
yes
i
told
you
that
i
begun
to
doubt
my
being
such
a
after
all
i
intimated
that
you
begun
the
softening
process
and
that
then
i
found
a
certain
other
young
woman
who
had
well
who
had
kept
up
the
good
oh
cried
billy
suddenly
with
a
peculiar
intonation
then
she
laughed
softly
well
that
was
the
confession
resumed
cyril
then
i
came
out
and
said
that
i
wanted
to
marry
her
but
there
is
where
i
did
get
the
encouragement
indeed
i
afraid
i
was
very
considerate
stammered
billy
no
you
were
agreed
cyril
moodily
i
did
know
but
now
his
voice
softened
a
little
with
this
new
happiness
of
yours
and
that
you
might
find
a
little
encouragement
for
and
i
will
cried
billy
promptly
tell
me
about
i
did
last
winter
reproached
the
man
and
you
were
sure
i
was
deceiving
myself
you
drew
the
gloomiest
sort
of
picture
of
the
misery
i
would
take
with
a
i
did
billy
was
laughing
very
merrily
now
yes
you
said
she
always
be
talking
and
laughing
when
i
wanted
to
be
quiet
and
that
she
want
to
drag
me
out
to
parties
and
plays
when
i
wanted
to
stay
at
home
and
oh
lots
of
things
i
tried
to
make
it
clear
to
you
that
that
this
little
woman
was
that
sort
but
i
could
finished
cyril
gloomily
but
of
course
she
is
declared
billy
with
quick
sympathy
i
i
did
know
what
i
was
talking
about
she
added
with
emphatic
distinctness
then
she
smiled
to
think
how
little
cyril
knew
how
very
true
those
words
were
tell
me
about
her
she
begged
again
i
know
she
must
be
very
lovely
and
brilliant
and
of
course
a
wonderful
musician
you
could
choose
any
one
else
to
her
surprise
cyril
turned
abruptly
and
began
to
play
again
a
nervous
little
staccato
scherzo
fell
from
his
fingers
but
it
dropped
almost
at
once
into
a
quieter
melody
and
ended
with
something
that
sounded
very
much
like
the
last
strain
of
home
sweet
then
he
wheeled
about
on
the
piano
stool
billy
that
exactly
where
you
wrong
i
do
want
that
kind
of
wife
i
do
want
a
brilliant
one
and
now
billy
this
sounds
like
horrible
heresy
i
know
but
it
true
i
do
care
whether
she
can
play
or
not
but
i
should
prefer
that
she
should
play
much
why
cyril
henshaw
and
you
with
your
music
as
if
you
could
be
contented
with
a
woman
like
that
oh
i
want
her
to
like
music
of
course
modified
cyril
but
i
care
to
have
her
make
it
billy
do
you
know
you
laugh
of
course
but
my
picture
of
a
wife
is
always
one
thing
a
room
with
a
table
and
a
shaded
lamp
and
a
little
woman
beside
it
with
the
light
on
her
hair
and
a
great
basket
of
sewing
beside
her
you
see
i
am
domestic
he
finished
a
little
defiantly
i
should
say
you
were
laughed
billy
and
have
you
found
her
this
little
woman
who
is
to
do
nothing
but
sit
and
sew
in
the
circle
of
the
shaded
lamp
yes
i
found
her
but
i
not
at
all
sure
she
found
me
where
i
want
your
help
oh
i
do
mean
of
course
he
added
that
she
got
to
sit
under
that
lamp
all
the
time
it
only
that
that
i
hope
she
likes
that
sort
of
and
does
she
yes
that
is
i
think
she
does
smiled
cyril
anyhow
she
told
me
once
that
that
the
things
she
liked
best
to
do
in
all
the
world
were
to
mend
stockings
and
to
make
billy
sprang
to
her
feet
with
a
little
cry
now
indeed
had
cyril
kept
his
promise
and
made
many
things
clear
to
her
cyril
come
here
she
cried
tremulously
leading
the
way
to
the
open
veranda
door
the
next
moment
cyril
was
looking
across
the
lawn
to
the
little
summerhouse
in
the
midst
of
billy
rose
garden
in
full
view
within
the
summerhouse
sat
marie
sewing
go
cyril
she
waiting
for
you
smiled
billy
mistily
the
only
the
sun
to
be
sure
and
maybe
there
is
a
whole
basket
of
sewing
there
but
she
there
you
guessed
then
breathed
cyril
i
not
guessed
i
know
and
it
all
you
mean
only
cyril
pleading
eyes
finished
the
question
yes
i
sure
she
does
nodded
billy
and
then
she
added
under
her
breath
as
the
man
passed
swiftly
down
the
steps
indeed
so
was
cyril
all
the
time
and
never
bertram
who
was
the
inspiration
of
that
bit
of
paper
when
she
turned
back
into
the
room
she
came
face
to
face
with
bertram
i
spoke
dear
but
you
did
hear
he
said
as
he
hurried
forward
with
outstretched
hands
bertram
greeted
billy
with
surprising
irrelevance
they
all
lived
happily
ever
after
they
did
is
that
always
the
ending
to
the
story
a
love
story
of
course
said
bertram
with
emphasis
our
love
story
and
theirs
supplemented
billy
softly
but
bertram
did
not
hear
that
