the
island
pharisees
by
john
galsworthy
but
this
is
a
worshipful
society
king
john
preface
each
man
born
into
the
world
is
born
like
shelton
in
this
book
to
go
a
journey
and
for
the
most
part
he
is
born
on
the
high
road
at
first
he
sits
there
in
the
dust
with
his
little
chubby
hands
reaching
at
nothing
and
his
little
solemn
eyes
staring
into
space
as
soon
as
he
can
toddle
he
moves
by
the
queer
instinct
we
call
the
love
of
life
straight
along
this
road
looking
neither
to
the
right
nor
left
so
pleased
is
he
to
walk
and
he
is
charmed
with
everything
with
the
nice
flat
road
all
broad
and
white
with
his
own
feet
and
with
the
prospect
he
can
see
on
either
hand
the
sun
shines
and
he
finds
the
road
a
little
hot
and
dusty
the
rain
falls
and
he
splashes
through
the
muddy
puddles
it
makes
no
matter
all
is
pleasant
his
fathers
went
this
way
before
him
they
made
this
road
for
him
to
tread
and
when
they
bred
him
passed
into
his
fibre
the
love
of
doing
things
as
they
themselves
had
done
them
so
he
walks
on
and
on
resting
comfortably
at
nights
under
the
roofs
that
have
been
raised
to
shelter
him
by
those
who
went
before
suddenly
one
day
without
intending
to
he
notices
a
path
or
opening
in
the
hedge
leading
to
right
or
left
and
he
stands
looking
at
the
undiscovered
after
that
he
stops
at
all
the
openings
in
the
hedge
one
day
with
a
beating
heart
he
tries
one
and
this
is
where
the
fun
begins
out
of
ten
of
him
that
try
the
narrow
path
nine
of
him
come
back
to
the
broad
road
and
when
they
pass
the
next
gap
in
the
hedge
they
say
no
no
my
friend
i
found
you
pleasant
for
a
while
but
after
after
that
the
way
my
fathers
went
is
good
enough
for
me
and
it
is
obviously
the
proper
one
for
nine
of
me
came
back
and
that
poor
silly
tenth
i
really
pity
him
and
when
he
comes
to
the
next
inn
and
snuggles
in
his
bed
he
thinks
of
the
wild
waste
of
heather
where
he
might
have
had
to
spend
the
night
alone
beneath
the
stars
nor
does
it
i
think
occur
to
him
that
the
broad
road
he
treads
all
day
was
once
a
trackless
heath
itself
but
the
poor
silly
tenth
is
faring
on
it
is
a
windy
night
that
he
is
travelling
through
a
windy
night
with
all
things
new
around
and
nothing
to
help
him
but
his
courage
nine
times
out
of
ten
that
courage
fails
and
he
goes
down
into
the
bog
he
has
seen
the
undiscovered
and
like
ferrand
in
this
book
the
undiscovered
has
engulfed
him
his
spirit
tougher
than
the
spirit
of
the
nine
that
burned
back
to
sleep
in
inns
was
yet
not
tough
enough
the
tenth
time
he
wins
across
and
on
the
traces
he
has
left
others
follow
slowly
cautiously
a
new
road
is
opened
to
mankind
a
true
saying
goes
whatever
is
is
right
and
if
all
men
from
the
world
beginning
had
said
that
the
world
would
never
have
begun
at
all
not
even
the
protoplasmic
jelly
could
have
commenced
its
journey
there
would
have
been
no
motive
force
to
make
it
start
and
so
that
other
saying
had
to
be
devised
before
the
world
could
set
up
business
whatever
is
is
wrong
but
since
the
cosmic
spirit
found
that
matters
moved
too
fast
if
those
that
felt
all
things
that
are
are
wrong
equalled
in
number
those
that
felt
all
things
that
are
are
right
it
solemnly
devised
polygamy
all
be
it
said
in
a
spiritual
way
of
speaking
and
to
each
male
spirit
crowing
all
things
that
are
are
wrong
it
decreed
nine
female
spirits
clucking
all
things
that
are
are
the
cosmic
spirit
who
was
very
much
an
artist
knew
its
work
and
had
previously
devised
a
quality
called
courage
and
divided
it
in
three
naming
the
parts
spiritual
moral
physical
to
all
the
spirits
but
to
no
female
spiritually
not
corporeally
speaking
it
gave
courage
that
was
spiritual
to
nearly
all
both
male
and
female
it
gave
courage
that
was
physical
to
very
many
spirits
it
gave
moral
courage
too
but
because
it
knew
that
if
all
the
spirits
were
complete
the
proportion
of
male
to
female
one
to
ten
would
be
too
great
and
cause
upheavals
it
so
arranged
that
only
one
in
ten
spirits
should
have
all
three
kinds
of
courage
so
that
the
other
nine
having
spiritual
courage
but
lacking
either
in
moral
or
in
physical
should
fail
in
their
extensions
of
the
and
having
started
them
upon
these
lines
it
left
them
to
get
along
as
best
they
might
thus
in
the
subdivision
of
the
that
we
call
england
the
proportion
of
the
others
to
the
complete
spirit
who
of
course
is
not
infrequently
a
woman
is
to
one
and
with
every
island
pharisee
when
he
or
she
starts
out
in
life
the
interesting
question
ought
to
be
am
i
that
one
ninety
very
soon
find
out
that
they
are
not
and
having
found
it
out
lest
others
should
discover
they
say
they
are
nine
of
the
other
ten
blinded
by
their
spiritual
courage
are
harder
to
convince
but
one
by
one
they
sink
still
proclaiming
their
virility
the
hundredth
pharisee
alone
sits
out
the
play
now
the
journey
of
this
young
man
shelton
who
is
surely
not
the
hundredth
pharisee
is
but
a
ragged
effort
to
present
the
working
of
the
truth
all
things
that
are
are
wrong
upon
the
truth
all
things
that
are
are
the
institutions
of
this
country
like
the
institutions
of
all
other
countries
are
but
they
are
the
working
daily
clothing
of
the
nation
no
more
the
body
permanent
dress
than
is
a
baby
frock
slowly
but
surely
they
wear
out
or
are
outgrown
and
in
their
fashion
they
are
always
thirty
years
at
least
behind
the
fashions
of
those
spirits
who
are
concerned
with
what
shall
take
their
place
the
conditions
that
dictate
our
education
the
distribution
of
our
property
our
marriage
laws
amusements
worship
prisons
and
all
other
things
change
imperceptibly
from
hour
to
hour
the
moulds
containing
them
being
inelastic
do
not
change
but
hold
on
to
the
point
of
bursting
and
then
are
hastily
often
clumsily
enlarged
the
ninety
desiring
peace
and
comfort
for
their
spirit
the
ninety
of
the
beds
will
have
it
that
the
fashions
need
not
change
that
morality
is
fixed
that
all
is
ordered
and
immutable
that
every
one
will
always
marry
play
and
worship
in
the
way
that
they
themselves
are
marrying
playing
worshipping
they
have
no
speculation
and
they
hate
with
a
deep
hatred
those
who
speculate
with
thought
this
is
the
function
they
were
made
for
they
are
the
dough
and
they
dislike
that
yeasty
stuff
of
life
which
comes
and
works
about
in
them
the
yeasty
stuff
the
other
ten
chafed
by
all
things
that
are
desirous
ever
of
new
forms
and
moulds
hate
in
their
turn
the
comfortable
ninety
each
party
has
invented
for
the
other
the
hardest
names
that
it
can
think
of
philistines
bourgeois
grundy
rebels
anarchists
and
so
we
go
on
and
so
as
each
of
us
is
born
to
go
his
journey
he
finds
himself
in
time
ranged
on
one
side
or
on
the
other
and
joins
the
choruses
of
but
now
and
then
ah
very
seldom
we
find
ourselves
so
near
that
thing
which
has
no
breadth
the
middle
line
that
we
can
watch
them
both
and
positively
smile
to
see
the
fun
when
this
book
was
published
first
many
of
its
critics
found
that
shelton
was
the
only
pharisee
and
a
most
unsatisfactory
young
man
and
so
no
doubt
he
is
belonging
to
the
comfortable
ninety
they
felt
in
fact
the
need
of
slinging
names
at
one
who
obviously
was
of
the
ten
others
of
its
critics
belonging
to
the
ten
wielded
their
epithets
upon
antonia
and
the
serried
ranks
behind
her
and
called
them
pharisees
as
dull
as
and
so
i
fear
they
are
one
of
the
greatest
charms
of
authorship
is
the
privilege
it
gives
the
author
of
studying
the
secret
springs
of
many
unseen
persons
of
analysing
human
nature
through
the
criticism
that
his
work
evokes
criticism
welling
out
of
the
instinctive
likings
or
aversions
out
of
the
very
fibre
of
the
human
being
who
delivers
it
criticism
that
often
seems
to
leap
out
against
the
critic
will
startled
like
a
fawn
from
some
deep
bed
of
sympathy
or
of
antipathy
and
so
all
authors
love
to
be
abused
as
any
man
can
see
in
the
little
matter
of
the
title
of
this
book
we
are
all
pharisees
whether
of
the
ninety
or
the
ten
and
we
certainly
do
live
upon
an
island
john
galsworthy
january
part
i
the
town
chapter
i
society
a
quiet
man
named
shelton
with
a
brown
face
and
a
short
fair
beard
stood
by
the
bookstall
at
dover
station
he
was
about
to
journey
up
to
london
and
had
placed
his
bag
in
the
corner
of
a
carriage
after
his
long
travel
the
voice
of
the
bookstall
clerk
offering
the
latest
novel
sounded
pleasant
pleasant
the
independent
answers
of
a
bearded
guard
and
the
stodgy
farewell
sayings
of
a
man
and
wife
the
limber
porters
trundling
their
barrows
the
greyness
of
the
station
and
the
good
stolid
humour
clinging
to
the
people
air
and
voices
all
brought
to
him
the
sense
of
home
meanwhile
he
wavered
between
purchasing
a
book
called
market
hayborough
which
he
had
read
and
would
certainly
enjoy
a
second
time
and
carlyle
french
revolution
which
he
had
not
read
and
was
doubtful
of
enjoying
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
buy
the
latter
but
he
did
not
relish
giving
up
the
former
while
he
hesitated
thus
his
carriage
was
beginning
to
fill
up
so
quickly
buying
both
he
took
up
a
position
from
which
he
could
defend
his
rights
nothing
he
thought
shows
people
up
like
the
carriage
was
almost
full
and
putting
his
bag
up
in
the
rack
he
took
his
seat
at
the
moment
of
starting
yet
another
passenger
a
girl
with
a
pale
face
scrambled
in
i
was
a
fool
to
go
third
thought
shelton
taking
in
his
neighbours
from
behind
his
journal
they
were
seven
a
grizzled
rustic
sat
in
the
far
corner
his
empty
pipe
bowl
downwards
jutted
like
a
handle
from
his
face
all
bleared
with
the
smear
of
nothingness
that
grows
on
those
who
pass
their
lives
in
the
current
of
hard
facts
next
to
him
a
ruddy
man
was
discussing
with
a
person
the
condition
of
their
gardens
and
shelton
watched
their
eyes
till
it
occurred
to
him
how
curious
a
look
was
in
them
a
watchful
friendliness
an
allied
distrust
and
that
their
voices
cheerful
even
jovial
seemed
to
be
cautious
all
the
time
his
glance
strayed
off
and
almost
rebounded
from
the
slightly
cross
and
wholly
face
of
a
stout
lady
in
a
costume
who
was
reading
the
strand
magazine
while
her
other
sleek
plump
hand
freed
from
its
black
glove
and
ornamented
with
a
thick
rested
on
her
lap
a
younger
and
female
was
sitting
next
her
looking
at
the
pale
girl
who
had
just
got
in
there
something
about
that
girl
thought
shelton
they
her
brown
eyes
certainly
looked
frightened
her
clothes
were
of
a
foreign
cut
suddenly
he
met
the
glance
of
another
pair
of
eyes
these
eyes
prominent
and
blue
stared
with
a
sort
of
subtle
roguery
from
above
a
thin
lopsided
nose
and
were
at
once
averted
they
gave
shelton
the
impression
that
he
was
being
judged
and
mocked
enticed
initiated
his
own
gaze
did
not
fall
this
sanguine
face
with
its
growth
of
reddish
beard
long
nose
full
lips
and
irony
puzzled
him
a
cynical
face
he
thought
and
then
but
sensitive
and
then
too
cynical
again
the
young
man
who
owned
it
sat
with
his
legs
parted
at
the
knees
his
dusty
and
boots
slanting
back
beneath
the
seat
his
yellow
crisped
as
if
rolling
cigarettes
a
strange
air
of
detachment
was
about
that
youthful
shabby
figure
and
not
a
scrap
of
luggage
filled
the
rack
above
his
head
the
frightened
girl
was
sitting
next
this
pagan
personality
it
was
possibly
the
lack
of
fashion
in
his
looks
that
caused
her
to
select
him
for
her
confidence
monsieur
she
asked
do
you
speak
french
then
can
you
tell
me
where
they
take
the
tickets
the
young
man
shook
his
head
no
said
he
i
am
a
the
girl
sighed
but
what
is
the
matter
the
girl
did
not
reply
twisting
her
hands
on
an
old
bag
in
her
lap
silence
had
stolen
on
the
carriage
a
silence
such
as
steals
on
animals
at
the
first
approach
of
danger
all
eyes
were
turned
towards
the
figures
of
the
foreigners
yes
broke
out
the
man
he
was
a
bit
squiffy
that
evening
old
ah
replied
his
neighbour
he
would
something
seemed
to
have
destroyed
their
look
of
mutual
distrust
the
plump
sleek
hand
of
the
lady
with
the
roman
nose
curved
convulsively
and
this
movement
corresponded
to
the
feeling
agitating
shelton
heart
it
was
almost
as
if
hand
and
heart
feared
to
be
asked
for
something
monsieur
said
the
girl
with
a
tremble
in
her
voice
i
am
very
unhappy
can
you
tell
me
what
to
do
i
had
no
money
for
a
the
foreign
youth
face
flickered
yes
he
said
that
might
happen
to
anyone
of
what
will
they
do
to
me
sighed
the
girl
do
lose
courage
the
young
man
slid
his
eyes
from
left
to
right
and
rested
them
on
shelton
although
i
do
as
yet
see
your
way
oh
monsieur
sighed
the
girl
and
though
it
was
clear
that
none
but
shelton
understood
what
they
were
saying
there
was
a
chilly
feeling
in
the
carriage
i
wish
i
could
assist
you
said
the
foreign
youth
unfortunately
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
again
his
eyes
returned
to
shelton
the
latter
thrust
his
hand
into
his
pocket
can
i
be
of
any
use
he
asked
in
english
certainly
sir
you
could
render
this
young
lady
the
greatest
possible
service
by
lending
her
the
money
for
a
shelton
produced
a
sovereign
which
the
young
man
took
passing
it
to
the
girl
he
said
a
thousand
thanks
une
belle
the
misgivings
which
attend
on
casual
charity
crowded
up
in
mind
he
was
ashamed
of
having
them
and
of
not
having
them
and
he
stole
covert
looks
at
this
young
foreigner
who
was
now
talking
to
the
girl
in
a
language
that
he
did
not
understand
though
vagabond
in
essence
the
fellow
face
showed
subtle
spirit
a
fortitude
and
irony
not
found
upon
the
face
of
normal
man
and
in
turning
from
it
to
the
other
passengers
shelton
was
conscious
of
revolt
contempt
and
questioning
that
he
could
not
define
leaning
back
with
eyes
he
tried
to
diagnose
this
new
sensation
he
found
it
disconcerting
that
the
faces
and
behaviour
of
his
neighbours
lacked
anything
he
could
grasp
and
secretly
abuse
they
continued
to
converse
with
admirable
and
slightly
conscious
phlegm
yet
he
knew
as
well
as
if
each
one
had
whispered
to
him
privately
that
this
shady
incident
had
shaken
them
something
unsettling
to
their
notions
of
dangerous
and
destructive
of
complacency
had
occurred
and
this
was
unforgivable
each
had
a
different
way
humorous
or
philosophic
contemptuous
sour
or
sly
of
showing
this
resentment
but
by
a
flash
of
insight
shelton
saw
that
at
the
bottom
of
their
minds
and
of
his
own
the
feeling
was
the
same
because
he
shared
in
their
resentment
he
was
enraged
with
them
and
with
himself
he
looked
at
the
plump
sleek
hand
of
the
woman
with
the
roman
nose
the
insulation
and
complacency
of
its
pale
skin
the
passive
righteousness
about
its
curve
the
prim
separation
from
the
others
of
the
fat
little
finger
had
acquired
a
wholly
unaccountable
importance
it
embodied
the
verdict
of
his
the
verdict
of
society
for
he
knew
that
whether
or
no
repugnant
to
the
mind
each
assemblage
of
eight
persons
even
in
a
carriage
contains
the
kernel
of
society
but
being
in
love
and
recently
engaged
shelton
had
a
right
to
be
immune
from
discontent
of
any
kind
and
he
reverted
to
his
mental
image
of
the
cool
fair
face
quick
movements
and
the
brilliant
smile
that
now
in
his
probationary
exile
haunted
his
imagination
he
took
out
his
fiancee
last
letter
but
the
voice
of
the
young
foreigner
addressing
him
in
rapid
french
caused
him
to
put
it
back
abruptly
from
what
she
tells
me
sir
he
said
bending
forward
to
be
out
of
hearing
of
the
girl
hers
is
an
unhappy
case
i
should
have
been
only
too
glad
to
help
her
but
as
you
see
and
he
made
a
gesture
by
which
shelton
observed
that
he
had
parted
from
his
waistcoat
i
am
not
rothschild
she
has
been
abandoned
by
the
man
who
brought
her
over
to
dover
under
promise
of
marriage
look
and
by
a
subtle
flicker
of
his
eyes
he
marked
how
the
two
ladies
had
edged
away
from
the
french
girl
they
take
good
care
not
to
let
their
garments
touch
her
they
are
virtuous
women
how
fine
a
thing
is
virtue
sir
and
finer
to
know
you
have
it
especially
when
you
are
never
likely
to
be
shelton
was
unable
to
repress
a
smile
and
when
he
smiled
his
face
grew
soft
have
you
observed
went
on
the
youthful
foreigner
that
those
who
by
temperament
and
circumstance
are
worst
fitted
to
pronounce
judgment
are
usually
the
first
to
judge
the
judgments
of
society
are
always
childish
seeing
that
it
composed
for
the
most
part
of
individuals
who
have
never
smelt
the
fire
and
look
at
this
they
who
have
money
run
too
great
a
risk
of
parting
with
it
if
they
do
accuse
the
penniless
of
being
rogues
and
shelton
was
startled
and
not
only
by
an
outburst
of
philosophy
from
an
utter
stranger
in
poor
clothes
but
at
this
singular
wording
of
his
own
private
thoughts
stifling
his
sense
of
the
unusual
for
the
queer
attraction
this
young
man
inspired
he
said
i
suppose
you
a
stranger
over
here
i
been
in
england
seven
months
but
not
yet
in
london
replied
the
other
i
count
on
doing
some
good
there
it
is
time
a
bitter
and
pathetic
smile
showed
for
a
second
on
his
lips
it
wo
be
my
fault
if
i
fail
you
are
english
sir
shelton
nodded
forgive
my
asking
your
voice
lacks
something
i
nearly
always
noticed
in
the
english
a
kind
of
cela
cocksureness
coming
from
your
nation
greatest
and
what
is
that
asked
shelton
with
a
smile
complacency
replied
the
youthful
foreigner
complacency
repeated
shelton
do
you
call
that
a
great
quality
i
should
rather
say
monsieur
a
great
defect
in
what
is
always
a
great
people
you
are
certainly
the
most
nation
on
the
earth
you
suffer
a
little
from
the
fact
if
i
were
an
english
preacher
my
desire
would
be
to
prick
the
heart
of
your
shelton
leaning
back
considered
this
impertinent
suggestion
hum
he
said
at
last
you
be
unpopular
i
do
know
that
we
any
cockier
than
other
the
young
foreigner
made
a
sign
as
though
confirming
this
opinion
in
effect
said
he
it
is
a
sufficiently
widespread
disease
look
at
these
people
here
and
with
a
rapid
glance
he
pointed
to
the
inmates
of
the
carnage
very
average
persons
what
have
they
done
to
warrant
their
making
a
virtuous
nose
at
those
who
do
not
walk
as
they
do
that
old
rustic
perhaps
is
different
he
never
thinks
at
all
but
look
at
those
two
occupied
with
their
stupidities
about
the
price
of
hops
the
prospects
of
potatoes
what
george
is
doing
a
thousand
things
all
of
that
sort
look
at
their
faces
i
come
of
the
bourgeoisie
myself
have
they
ever
shown
proof
of
any
quality
that
gives
them
the
right
to
pat
themselves
upon
the
back
no
fear
outside
potatoes
they
know
nothing
and
what
they
do
not
understand
they
dread
and
they
despise
there
are
millions
of
that
breed
la
societe
the
sole
quality
these
people
have
shown
they
have
is
cowardice
i
was
educated
by
the
jesuits
he
concluded
it
has
given
me
a
way
of
under
ordinary
circumstances
shelton
would
have
murmured
in
a
voice
ah
quite
so
and
taken
refuge
in
the
columns
of
the
daily
telegraph
in
place
of
this
for
some
reason
that
he
did
not
understand
he
looked
at
the
young
foreigner
and
asked
why
do
you
say
all
this
to
me
the
tramp
for
by
his
boots
he
could
hardly
have
been
better
hesitated
when
you
travelled
like
me
he
said
as
if
resolved
to
speak
the
truth
you
acquire
an
instinct
in
choosing
to
whom
and
how
you
speak
it
is
necessity
that
makes
the
law
if
you
want
to
live
you
must
learn
all
that
sort
of
thing
to
make
face
against
shelton
who
himself
possessed
a
certain
subtlety
could
not
but
observe
the
complimentary
nature
of
these
words
it
was
like
saying
i
not
afraid
of
you
misunderstanding
me
and
thinking
me
a
rascal
just
because
i
study
human
but
is
there
nothing
to
be
done
for
that
poor
girl
his
new
acquaintance
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
broken
jug
said
he
you
never
mend
her
she
going
to
a
cousin
in
london
to
see
if
she
can
get
help
you
given
her
the
means
of
getting
there
it
all
that
you
can
do
one
knows
too
well
become
of
shelton
said
gravely
oh
that
horrible
could
she
be
induced
to
go
back
home
i
should
be
glad
the
foreign
vagrant
shook
his
head
mon
cher
monsieur
he
said
you
evidently
have
not
yet
had
occasion
to
know
what
the
is
like
family
does
not
like
damaged
goods
it
will
have
nothing
to
say
to
sons
whose
hands
have
dipped
into
the
till
or
daughters
no
longer
to
be
married
what
the
devil
would
they
do
with
her
better
put
a
stone
about
her
neck
and
let
her
drown
at
once
all
the
world
is
christian
but
christian
and
good
samaritan
are
not
quite
the
shelton
looked
at
the
girl
who
was
sitting
motionless
with
her
hands
crossed
on
her
bag
and
a
revolt
against
the
unfair
ways
of
life
arose
within
him
yes
said
the
young
foreigner
as
if
reading
all
his
thoughts
called
virtue
is
nearly
always
only
he
rolled
his
eyes
as
though
to
say
ah
la
conventions
have
them
by
all
means
but
do
look
like
peacocks
because
you
are
preserving
them
it
is
but
cowardice
and
luck
my
friends
but
cowardice
and
luck
look
here
said
shelton
i
give
her
my
address
and
if
she
wants
to
go
back
to
her
family
she
can
write
to
she
never
go
back
she
wo
have
the
shelton
caught
the
cringing
glance
of
the
girl
eyes
in
the
droop
of
her
lip
there
was
something
sensuous
and
the
conviction
that
the
young
man
words
were
true
came
over
him
i
had
better
not
give
them
my
private
address
he
thought
glancing
at
the
faces
opposite
and
he
wrote
down
the
following
richard
paramor
shelton
paramor
and
herring
lincoln
inn
you
very
good
sir
my
name
is
louis
ferrand
no
address
at
present
i
make
her
understand
she
half
stupefied
just
shelton
returned
to
the
perusal
of
his
paper
too
disturbed
to
read
the
young
vagrant
words
kept
sounding
in
his
ears
he
raised
his
eyes
the
plump
hand
of
the
lady
with
the
roman
nose
still
rested
on
her
lap
it
had
been
recased
in
its
black
glove
with
large
white
stitching
her
frowning
gaze
was
fixed
on
him
suspiciously
as
if
he
had
outraged
her
sense
of
decency
he
did
get
anything
from
me
said
the
voice
of
the
man
ending
a
talk
on
the
train
whistled
loudly
and
shelton
reverted
to
his
paper
this
time
he
crossed
his
legs
determined
to
enjoy
the
latest
murder
once
more
he
found
himself
looking
at
the
vagrant
mocking
face
that
fellow
he
thought
has
seen
and
felt
ten
times
as
much
as
i
although
he
must
be
ten
years
he
turned
for
distraction
to
the
landscape
with
its
april
clouds
trim
hedgerows
homely
coverts
but
strange
ideas
would
come
and
he
was
discontented
with
himself
the
conversation
he
had
had
the
personality
of
this
young
foreigner
disturbed
him
it
was
all
as
though
he
had
made
a
start
in
some
fresh
journey
through
the
fields
of
thought
chapter
ii
antonia
five
years
before
the
journey
just
described
shelton
had
stood
one
afternoon
on
the
barge
of
his
old
college
at
the
end
of
the
summer
races
he
had
been
down
from
oxford
for
some
years
but
these
olympian
contests
still
attracted
him
the
boats
were
passing
and
in
the
usual
rush
to
the
barge
side
his
arm
came
in
contact
with
a
soft
young
shoulder
he
saw
close
to
him
a
young
girl
with
fair
hair
knotted
in
a
ribbon
whose
face
was
eager
with
excitement
the
pointed
chin
long
neck
the
fluffy
hair
quick
gestures
and
the
calm
strenuousness
of
her
eyes
impressed
him
vividly
oh
we
must
bump
them
he
heard
her
sigh
do
you
know
my
people
shelton
said
a
voice
behind
his
back
and
he
was
granted
a
touch
from
the
girl
shy
impatient
hand
the
warmer
fingers
of
a
lady
with
kindly
eyes
resembling
a
hare
the
dry
of
a
gentleman
with
a
thin
arched
nose
and
a
quizzical
brown
face
are
you
the
shelton
who
used
to
play
the
at
eton
said
the
lady
oh
we
so
often
heard
of
you
from
bernard
he
was
your
fag
was
he
how
distressin
it
is
to
see
these
poor
boys
in
the
boats
mother
they
like
it
cried
the
girl
antonia
ought
to
be
rowing
herself
said
her
father
whose
name
was
dennant
shelton
went
back
with
them
to
their
hotel
walking
beside
antonia
through
the
christchurch
meadows
telling
her
details
of
his
college
life
he
dined
with
them
that
evening
and
when
he
left
had
a
feeling
like
that
produced
by
a
first
glass
of
champagne
the
dennants
lived
at
holm
oaks
within
six
miles
of
oxford
and
two
days
later
he
drove
over
and
paid
a
call
amidst
the
avocations
of
reading
for
the
bar
of
cricket
racing
shooting
it
but
required
a
whiff
of
some
fresh
scent
hay
honeysuckle
clover
to
bring
face
before
him
with
its
uncertain
colour
and
its
frank
distant
eyes
but
two
years
passed
before
he
again
saw
her
then
at
an
invitation
from
bernard
dennant
he
played
cricket
for
the
manor
of
holm
oaks
against
a
neighbouring
house
in
the
evening
there
was
dancing
oh
the
lawn
the
fair
hair
was
now
turned
up
but
the
eyes
were
quite
unchanged
their
steps
went
together
and
they
outlasted
every
other
couple
on
the
slippery
grass
thence
perhaps
sprang
her
respect
for
him
he
was
wiry
a
little
taller
than
herself
and
seemed
to
talk
of
things
that
interested
her
he
found
out
she
was
seventeen
and
she
found
out
that
he
was
the
following
two
years
shelton
went
to
holm
oaks
whenever
he
was
asked
to
him
this
was
a
period
of
enchanted
games
of
theatricals
and
distant
sounds
of
practised
music
and
during
it
antonia
eyes
grew
more
friendly
and
more
curious
and
his
own
more
shy
and
schooled
more
furtive
and
more
ardent
then
came
his
father
death
a
voyage
round
the
world
and
that
peculiar
hour
of
mixed
sensations
when
one
march
morning
abandoning
his
steamer
at
marseilles
he
took
train
for
hyeres
he
found
her
at
one
of
those
exclusive
hostelries
amongst
the
pines
where
the
best
english
go
in
common
with
americans
russian
princesses
and
jewish
families
he
would
not
have
been
shocked
to
find
her
elsewhere
but
he
would
have
been
surprised
his
sunburnt
face
and
the
new
beard
on
which
he
set
some
undefined
value
apologetically
displayed
were
scanned
by
those
blue
eyes
with
rapid
glances
at
once
more
friendly
and
less
friendly
ah
they
seemed
to
say
here
you
are
how
glad
i
am
but
what
now
he
was
admitted
to
their
sacred
table
at
the
table
a
snowy
oblong
in
an
airy
alcove
where
the
honourable
dennant
miss
dennant
and
the
honourable
charlotte
penguin
a
maiden
aunt
with
insufficient
lungs
sat
twice
a
day
in
their
own
atmosphere
a
momentary
weakness
came
on
shelton
the
first
time
he
saw
them
sitting
there
at
lunch
what
was
it
gave
them
their
look
of
strange
detachment
dennant
was
bending
above
a
camera
i
afraid
d
you
know
it
she
said
what
a
pity
the
kitten
was
rather
nice
the
maiden
aunt
placing
the
knitting
of
a
red
silk
tie
beside
her
plate
turned
her
aspiring
gaze
on
shelton
look
auntie
said
antonia
in
her
clear
quick
voice
there
the
funny
little
man
again
oh
said
the
maiden
aunt
a
smile
revealed
her
upper
teeth
she
looked
for
the
funny
little
man
who
was
not
english
he
rather
nice
shelton
did
not
look
for
the
funny
little
man
he
stole
a
glance
that
barely
reached
antonia
brow
where
her
eyebrows
took
their
tiny
upward
slant
at
the
outer
corners
and
her
hair
was
still
ruffled
by
a
windy
walk
from
that
moment
he
became
her
slave
mr
shelton
do
you
know
anything
about
these
periscopic
binoculars
said
dennant
voice
they
splendid
for
buildin
but
buildin
are
so
disappointin
the
thing
is
to
get
human
interest
is
it
and
her
glance
wandered
absently
past
shelton
in
search
of
human
interest
you
have
put
down
what
you
taken
from
a
little
leather
bag
dennant
took
a
little
leather
book
it
so
easy
to
forget
what
they
about
she
said
that
so
shelton
was
not
again
visited
by
his
uneasiness
at
their
detachment
he
accepted
them
and
all
their
works
for
there
was
something
quite
sublime
about
the
way
that
they
would
leave
the
unconscious
that
they
themselves
were
funny
to
all
the
people
they
had
found
so
funny
while
they
had
been
sitting
there
and
he
would
follow
them
out
unnecessarily
upright
and
feeling
like
a
fool
in
the
ensuing
fortnight
chaperoned
by
the
maiden
aunt
for
dennant
disliked
driving
he
sat
opposite
to
antonia
during
many
drives
he
played
sets
of
tennis
with
her
but
it
was
in
the
evenings
after
dinner
those
long
evenings
on
a
parquet
floor
in
wicker
chairs
dragged
as
far
as
might
be
from
the
heating
apparatus
that
he
seemed
so
very
near
her
the
community
of
isolation
drew
them
closer
in
place
of
a
companion
he
had
assumed
the
part
of
friend
to
whom
she
could
confide
all
her
aspirations
so
that
even
when
she
was
sitting
silent
a
slim
long
foot
stretched
out
in
front
bending
with
an
air
of
cool
absorption
over
some
pencil
sketches
which
she
would
not
show
him
even
then
by
her
very
attitude
by
the
sweet
freshness
that
clung
about
her
by
her
quick
offended
glances
at
the
strange
persons
round
she
seemed
to
acknowledge
in
some
secret
way
that
he
was
necessary
he
was
far
from
realising
this
his
intellectual
and
observant
parts
were
hypnotised
and
fascinated
even
by
her
failings
the
faint
freckling
across
her
nose
the
slim
and
virginal
severeness
of
her
figure
with
its
narrow
hips
and
arms
the
curve
of
her
long
were
added
charms
she
had
the
wind
and
rain
look
a
taste
of
home
and
over
the
glaring
roads
where
the
shadows
lay
so
black
she
seemed
to
pass
like
the
very
image
of
an
english
day
one
afternoon
he
had
taken
her
to
play
tennis
with
some
friends
and
afterwards
they
strolled
on
to
her
favourite
view
down
the
toulon
road
gardens
and
hills
were
bathed
in
the
colour
of
ripe
apricot
an
evening
crispness
had
stolen
on
the
air
the
blood
released
from
the
numbing
ran
gladly
in
the
veins
on
the
right
hand
of
the
road
was
a
frenchman
playing
bowls
enormous
busy
pleased
and
upright
as
a
soldier
pathetically
trotting
his
vast
carcass
from
end
to
end
he
delighted
shelton
but
antonia
threw
a
single
look
at
the
huge
creature
and
her
face
expressed
disgust
she
began
running
up
towards
the
ruined
tower
shelton
let
her
keep
in
front
watching
her
leap
from
stone
to
stone
and
throw
back
defiant
glances
when
he
pressed
behind
she
stood
at
the
top
and
he
looked
up
at
her
over
the
world
gloriously
spread
below
she
like
a
statue
seemed
to
rule
the
colour
was
brilliant
in
her
cheeks
her
young
bosom
heaved
her
eyes
shone
and
the
flowing
droop
of
her
long
full
sleeves
gave
to
her
poised
figure
the
look
of
one
who
flies
he
pulled
himself
up
and
stood
beside
her
his
heart
choked
him
all
the
colour
had
left
his
cheeks
antonia
he
said
i
love
she
started
as
if
his
whisper
had
intruded
on
her
thoughts
but
his
face
must
have
expressed
his
hunger
for
the
resentment
in
her
eyes
vanished
they
stood
for
several
minutes
without
speaking
and
then
went
home
shelton
painfully
revolved
the
riddle
of
the
colour
in
her
face
had
he
a
chance
then
was
it
possible
that
evening
the
instinct
vouchsafed
at
times
to
lovers
in
place
of
reason
caused
him
to
pack
his
bag
and
go
to
cannes
on
returning
two
days
later
and
approaching
the
group
in
the
centre
of
the
winter
garden
the
voice
of
the
maiden
aunt
reading
aloud
an
extract
from
the
morning
post
reached
him
across
the
room
do
you
think
that
rather
nice
he
heard
her
ask
and
then
oh
here
you
aye
it
very
nice
to
see
you
back
shelton
slipped
into
a
wicker
chair
antonia
looked
up
quickly
from
her
put
out
a
hand
but
did
not
speak
he
watched
her
bending
head
and
his
eagerness
was
changed
to
gloom
with
desperate
vivacity
he
sustained
the
five
intolerable
minutes
of
inquiry
where
had
he
been
what
had
he
been
doing
then
once
again
the
maiden
aunt
commenced
her
extracts
from
the
morning
post
a
touch
on
his
sleeve
startled
him
antonia
was
leaning
forward
her
cheeks
were
crimson
above
the
pallor
of
her
neck
would
you
like
to
see
my
sketches
to
shelton
bending
above
those
sketches
that
drawl
of
the
maiden
aunt
intoning
the
paper
was
the
most
pleasant
sound
that
he
had
ever
listened
to
my
dear
dick
dennant
said
to
him
a
fortnight
later
we
would
rather
after
you
leave
here
that
you
do
see
each
other
again
until
july
of
course
i
know
you
count
it
an
engagement
and
all
that
and
everybody
been
writin
to
congratulate
you
but
algie
thinks
you
ought
to
give
yourselves
a
chance
young
people
do
always
know
what
about
you
know
it
not
long
to
three
months
gasped
shelton
he
had
to
swallow
down
this
pill
with
what
grace
he
could
command
there
was
no
alternative
antonia
had
acquiesced
in
the
condition
with
a
queer
grave
pleasure
as
if
she
expected
it
to
do
her
good
it
be
something
to
look
forward
to
dick
she
said
he
postponed
departure
as
long
as
possible
and
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
april
that
he
left
for
england
she
came
alone
to
see
him
off
it
was
drizzling
but
her
tall
slight
figure
in
the
golf
cape
looked
impervious
to
cold
and
rain
amongst
the
shivering
natives
desperately
he
clutched
her
hand
warm
through
the
wet
glove
her
smile
seemed
heartless
in
its
brilliancy
he
whispered
you
will
write
of
course
do
be
so
stupid
you
old
dick
she
ran
forward
as
the
train
began
to
move
her
clear
sounded
shrill
and
hard
above
the
rumble
of
the
wheels
he
saw
her
raise
her
hand
an
umbrella
waving
and
last
of
all
vivid
still
amongst
receding
shapes
the
red
spot
of
her
scarlet
chapter
iii
a
zoological
garden
after
his
journey
up
from
dover
shelton
was
still
fathering
his
luggage
at
charing
cross
when
the
foreign
girl
passed
him
and
in
spite
of
his
desire
to
say
something
cheering
he
could
get
nothing
out
but
a
smile
her
figure
vanished
wavering
into
the
one
of
his
bags
had
gone
astray
and
so
all
thought
of
her
soon
faded
from
his
mind
his
cab
however
overtook
the
foreign
vagrant
marching
along
towards
pall
mall
with
a
curious
lengthy
stride
an
observant
disillusioned
figure
the
first
bustle
of
installation
over
time
hung
heavy
on
his
hands
july
loomed
distant
as
in
some
future
century
antonia
eyes
beckoned
him
faintly
hopelessly
she
would
not
even
be
coming
back
to
england
for
another
month
i
met
a
young
foreigner
in
the
train
from
dover
he
wrote
to
her
a
curious
sort
of
person
altogether
who
seems
to
have
infected
me
everything
here
has
gone
flat
and
unprofitable
the
only
good
things
in
life
are
your
letters
john
noble
dined
with
me
yesterday
the
poor
fellow
tried
to
persuade
me
to
stand
for
parliament
why
should
i
think
myself
fit
to
legislate
for
the
unhappy
wretches
one
sees
about
in
the
streets
if
people
faces
are
a
fair
test
of
their
happiness
i
d
rather
not
feel
in
any
way
responsible
the
streets
in
fact
after
his
long
absence
in
the
east
afforded
him
much
food
for
thought
the
curious
smugness
of
the
the
utterly
unending
bustle
the
fearful
medley
of
miserable
women
and
men
with
leering
eyes
whom
he
saw
everywhere
in
club
windows
on
their
beats
on
box
seats
on
the
steps
of
hotels
discharging
dilatory
duties
the
appalling
chaos
of
capable
dames
with
defiant
clothes
and
men
of
splendid
creatures
in
their
cabs
and
cadging
creatures
in
their
broken
hats
the
callousness
and
the
monotony
one
afternoon
in
may
he
received
this
letter
couched
in
french
blank
row
westminster
my
dear
sir
excuse
me
for
recalling
to
your
memory
the
offer
of
assistance
you
so
kindly
made
me
during
the
journey
from
dover
to
london
in
which
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
travel
with
a
man
like
you
having
beaten
the
whole
town
ignorant
of
what
wood
to
make
arrows
nearly
at
the
end
of
my
resources
my
spirit
profoundly
discouraged
i
venture
to
avail
myself
of
your
permission
knowing
your
good
heart
since
i
saw
you
i
have
run
through
all
the
misfortunes
of
the
calendar
and
can
not
tell
what
door
is
left
at
which
i
have
not
knocked
i
presented
myself
at
the
business
firm
with
whose
name
you
supplied
me
but
being
unfortunately
in
rags
they
refused
to
give
me
your
address
is
this
not
very
much
in
the
english
character
they
told
me
to
write
and
said
they
would
forward
the
letter
i
put
all
my
hopes
in
you
believe
me
my
dear
sir
whatever
you
may
decide
your
devoted
louis
ferrand
shelton
looked
at
the
envelope
and
saw
that
it
bore
date
a
week
ago
the
face
of
the
young
vagrant
rose
before
him
vital
mocking
sensitive
the
sound
of
his
quick
french
buzzed
in
his
ears
and
oddly
the
whole
whiff
of
him
had
a
power
of
raising
more
vividly
than
ever
his
memories
of
antonia
it
had
been
at
the
end
of
the
journey
from
hyeres
to
london
that
he
had
met
him
that
seemed
to
give
the
youth
a
claim
he
took
his
hat
and
hurried
to
blank
row
dismissing
his
cab
at
the
corner
of
victoria
street
he
with
difficulty
found
the
house
in
question
it
was
a
doorless
place
with
corridor
in
other
words
a
by
tapping
on
a
sort
of
with
a
sliding
window
he
attracted
the
attention
of
a
blowsy
woman
with
on
her
arms
who
informed
him
that
the
person
he
was
looking
for
had
gone
without
leaving
his
address
but
is
there
anybody
asked
shelton
of
whom
i
can
make
inquiry
yes
there
a
and
opening
an
inner
door
she
bellowed
frenchy
wanted
and
disappeared
a
yellow
little
man
cynical
and
weary
in
the
face
as
if
a
moral
had
passed
over
it
answered
this
call
and
stood
sniffing
as
it
were
at
shelton
on
whom
he
made
the
singular
impression
of
some
little
creature
in
a
cage
he
left
here
ten
days
ago
in
the
company
of
a
mulatto
what
do
you
want
with
him
if
i
may
ask
the
little
man
yellow
cheeks
were
wrinkled
with
suspicion
shelton
produced
the
letter
ah
now
i
know
you
a
pale
smile
broke
through
the
he
spoke
of
you
i
can
only
find
him
he
used
to
say
saved
i
liked
that
young
man
he
had
is
there
no
way
of
getting
at
him
through
his
consul
the
frenchman
shook
his
head
might
as
well
look
for
diamonds
at
the
bottom
of
the
do
you
think
he
will
come
back
here
but
by
that
time
i
suppose
hardly
be
here
yourself
a
gleam
of
amusement
played
about
the
frenchman
teeth
i
oh
yes
sir
once
upon
a
time
i
cherished
the
hope
of
emerging
i
no
longer
have
illusions
i
shave
these
specimens
for
a
living
and
shall
shave
them
till
the
day
of
judgment
but
leave
a
letter
with
me
by
all
means
he
will
come
back
there
an
overcoat
of
his
here
on
which
he
borrowed
money
it
worth
more
oh
yes
he
will
come
back
a
youth
of
principle
leave
a
letter
with
me
i
always
shelton
hesitated
but
those
last
three
words
i
always
here
touched
him
in
their
simplicity
nothing
more
dreadful
could
be
said
can
you
find
me
a
sheet
of
paper
then
he
asked
please
keep
the
change
for
the
trouble
i
am
giving
thank
you
said
the
frenchman
simply
he
told
me
that
your
heart
was
good
if
you
do
mind
the
kitchen
you
could
write
there
at
your
shelton
wrote
his
letter
at
the
table
of
this
kitchen
in
company
with
an
aged
gentleman
who
was
muttering
to
himself
and
shelton
tried
to
avoid
attracting
his
attention
suspecting
that
he
was
not
sober
just
as
he
was
about
to
take
his
leave
however
the
old
fellow
thus
accosted
him
did
you
ever
go
to
the
dentist
mister
he
said
working
at
a
loose
tooth
with
his
shrivelled
fingers
i
went
to
a
dentist
once
who
professed
to
stop
teeth
without
giving
pain
and
the
beggar
did
stop
my
teeth
without
pain
but
did
they
stay
in
those
stoppings
no
my
bhoy
they
came
out
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
now
i
shimply
ask
you
call
that
dentistry
fixing
his
eyes
on
shelton
collar
which
had
the
misfortune
to
be
high
and
clean
he
resumed
with
drunken
scorn
ut
the
same
all
over
this
pharisaical
counthry
talk
of
high
morality
and
civilisation
the
world
was
never
at
such
low
ebb
phwhat
all
this
morality
ut
stinks
of
the
shop
look
at
the
condition
of
art
in
this
counthry
look
at
the
fools
you
see
upon
stage
look
at
the
pictures
and
books
that
sell
i
know
what

talking
about

am
a
sandwich

certain
depth

the
skin
but
pierce
ut
oh
dear
no
we
hate
to
see
the
blood
fly
eh
shelton
stood
disconcerted
not
knowing
if
he
were
expected
to
reply
but
the
old
gentleman
pursing
up
his
lips
went
on
sir
there
are
no
extremes
in
this
land
do
ye
think
blanks
loike
me
ought
to
exist
whoy
do
they
kill
us
off
palliatives

and
whoy
because

extreme

look
at

streets

are
a
scandal
to
the
world

wo
recognise
that
they
exist
their
noses

so
dam
high

truth
in
this
counthry
my
bhoy
and
he
whispered
confidentially
ut
pays
eh
you
say
why
should
they
then
but
shelton
had
not
spoken
well
let
but
do
tell
me
morality
do
tell
me
civilisation
what
can
you
expect
in
a
counthry
where
the
crimson
emotions
are
never
allowed
to
smell
the
air
and
the
result
my
bhoy
the
result
is
sentiment
a
yellow
thing
with
blue
spots
like
a
fungus
or
a
stilton
cheese
go
to
the
theatre
and
see
one
of
these
things
they
call
plays
tell
me
are
they
food
for
men
and
women
why
they
pap
for
babes
and
i
was
a
blanky
actor
moyself
shelton
listened
with
mingled
feelings
of
amusement
and
dismay
till
the
old
actor
having
finished
resumed
his
crouching
posture
at
the
table
you
do
get
dhrunk
i
suppose
he
said
suddenly
too
much
of
englishman
no
very
seldom
said
shelton
pity
think
of
the
pleasures
of
oblivion
oi
dhrunk
every
how
long
will
you
last
at
that
rate
there
speaks
the
englishman
why
should
oi
give
up
me
only
pleasure
to
keep
me
wretched
life
in
if
you
anything
left
worth
the
keeping
shober
for
keep
shober
by
all
means
if
not
the
sooner
you
are
dhrunk
the
better
that
stands
to
in
the
corridor
shelton
asked
the
frenchman
where
the
old
man
came
from
oh
and
englishman
yes
yes
from
belfast
very
drunken
old
man
you
are
a
drunken
nation
he
made
a
motion
with
his
hands
he
no
longer
eats
no
inside
left
it
is
man
of
spirit
if
you
have
never
seen
one
of
these
palaces
monsieur
i
shall
be
happy
to
show
you
over
shelton
took
out
his
cigarette
case
yes
yes
said
the
frenchman
making
a
wry
nose
and
taking
a
cigarette
i
accustomed
to
it
but
you
wise
to
fumigate
the
air
one
is
in
a
and
shelton
felt
ashamed
of
his
fastidiousness
this
said
the
guide
leading
him
and
opening
a
door
is
a
specimen
of
the
apartments
reserved
for
these
princes
of
the
there
were
four
empty
beds
on
iron
legs
and
with
the
air
of
a
showman
the
frenchman
twitched
away
a
dingy
quilt
they
go
out
in
the
mornings
earn
enough
to
make
them
drunk
sleep
it
off
and
then
begin
again
that
their
life
there
are
people
who
think
they
ought
to
be
reformed
cher
monsieur
one
must
face
reality
a
little
even
in
this
country
it
would
be
a
hundred
times
better
for
these
people
to
spend
their
time
reforming
high
society
your
high
society
makes
all
these
creatures
there
no
harvest
without
cutting
stalks
moi
he
continued
putting
back
the
quilt
and
dribbling
cigarette
smoke
through
his
nose
there
no
grand
difference
between
your
high
society
and
these
individuals
here
both
want
pleasure
both
think
only
of
themselves
which
is
very
natural
one
lot
have
had
the
luck
the
other
well
you
he
shrugged
a
common
set
i
been
robbed
here
half
a
dozen
times
if
you
have
new
shoes
a
good
waistcoat
an
overcoat
you
want
eyes
in
the
back
of
your
head
and
they
are
populated
change
your
bed
and
you
run
all
the
dangers
of
not
sleeping
alone
ma
clientele
the
half
of
them
do
pay
me
he
snapped
his
yellow
sticks
of
fingers
a
penny
for
a
shave
twopence
a
cut
vie
here
he
continued
standing
by
a
bed
is
a
gentleman
who
owes
me
fivepence
here
one
who
was
a
soldier
he
done
for
all
brutalised
not
one
with
any
courage
left
but
believe
me
monsieur
he
went
on
opening
another
door
when
you
come
down
to
houses
of
this
sort
you
must
have
a
vice
it
as
necessary
as
breath
is
to
the
lungs
no
matter
what
you
must
have
a
vice
to
give
you
a
little
solace
peu
de
soulagement
ah
yes
before
you
judge
these
swine
reflect
on
life
i
been
through
it
monsieur
it
is
not
nice
never
to
know
where
to
get
your
next
meal
gentlemen
who
have
food
in
their
stomachs
money
in
their
pockets
and
know
where
to
get
more
they
never
think
why
should
they
de
danger
all
these
cages
are
the
same
come
down
and
you
shall
see
the
he
took
shelton
through
the
kitchen
which
seemed
the
only
of
the
establishment
to
an
inner
room
furnished
with
dirty
cups
and
saucers
plates
and
knives
another
fire
was
burning
there
we
always
have
hot
water
said
the
frenchman
and
three
times
a
week
they
make
a
fire
down
there
he
pointed
to
a
cellar
for
our
clients
to
boil
their
vermin
oh
yes
we
have
all
the
shelton
returned
to
the
kitchen
and
directly
after
took
leave
of
the
little
frenchman
who
said
with
a
kind
of
moral
as
if
trying
to
adopt
him
as
a
patron
trust
me
monsieur
if
he
comes
back
that
young
man
he
shall
have
your
letter
without
fail
my
name
is
carolan
jules
carolan
and
i
am
always
at
your
chapter
iv
the
play
shelton
walked
away
he
had
been
indulging
in
a
nightmare
that
old
actor
was
drunk
thought
he
and
no
doubt
he
was
an
irishman
still
there
may
be
truth
in
what
he
said
i
am
a
pharisee
like
all
the
rest
who
are
in
the
pit
my
respectability
is
only
luck
what
should
i
have
become
if
i
been
born
into
his
kind
of
life
and
he
stared
at
a
stream
of
people
coming
from
the
stares
trying
to
pierce
the
mask
of
their
serious
complacent
faces
if
these
ladies
and
gentlemen
were
put
into
that
pit
into
which
he
had
been
looking
would
a
single
one
of
them
emerge
again
but
the
effort
of
picturing
them
there
was
too
much
for
him
it
was
too
far
too
ridiculously
far
one
particular
couple
a
large
fine
man
and
wife
who
in
the
midst
of
all
the
dirt
and
rumbling
hurry
the
gloomy
ludicrous
and
desperately
jovial
streets
walked
side
by
side
in
silence
had
evidently
bought
some
article
which
pleased
them
there
was
nothing
offensive
in
their
manner
they
seemed
quite
unconcerned
at
the
passing
of
the
other
people
the
man
had
that
fine
solidity
of
shoulder
and
of
waist
the
glossy
that
belongs
to
those
with
horses
guns
and
the
wife
her
chin
comfortably
settled
in
her
fur
kept
her
grey
eyes
on
the
ground
and
when
she
spoke
her
even
and
unruffled
voice
reached
shelton
ears
above
all
the
whirring
of
the
traffic
it
was
leisurely
precise
as
if
it
had
never
hurried
had
never
been
exhausted
or
passionate
or
afraid
their
talk
like
that
of
many
dozens
of
fine
couples
invading
london
from
their
country
places
was
of
where
to
dine
what
theatre
they
should
go
to
whom
they
had
seen
what
they
should
buy
and
shelton
knew
that
from
day
end
to
end
and
even
in
their
bed
these
would
be
the
subjects
of
their
conversation
they
were
the
people
of
the
sort
he
met
in
country
houses
and
accepted
as
of
course
with
a
vague
discomfort
at
the
bottom
of
his
soul
antonia
home
for
instance
had
been
full
of
them
they
were
the
people
of
the
sort
who
supported
charities
knew
everybody
had
clear
calm
judgment
and
intolerance
of
all
such
conduct
as
seemed
to
them
impossible
all
breaches
of
morality
such
as
mistakes
of
etiquette
such
as
dishonesty
passion
sympathy
except
with
a
canonised
class
of
objects
the
legitimate
sufferings
for
instance
of
their
own
families
and
class
how
healthy
they
were
the
memory
of
the
worked
in
shelton
mind
like
poison
he
was
conscious
that
in
his
own
groomed
figure
in
the
undemonstrative
assurance
of
his
walk
he
bore
resemblance
to
the
couple
he
apostrophised
ah
he
thought
how
vulgar
our
refinement
is
but
he
hardly
believed
in
his
own
outburst
these
people
were
so
well
mannered
so
well
conducted
and
so
healthy
he
could
not
really
understand
what
irritated
him
what
was
the
matter
with
them
they
fulfilled
their
duties
had
good
appetites
clear
consciences
all
the
furniture
of
perfect
citizens
they
merely
a
loss
that
he
had
read
was
suffered
by
plants
and
animals
which
no
longer
had
a
need
for
using
them
some
rare
national
faculty
of
seeing
only
the
obvious
and
materially
useful
had
destroyed
their
power
of
catching
gleams
or
scents
to
right
or
left
the
lady
looked
up
at
her
husband
the
light
of
quiet
proprietary
affection
shone
in
her
calm
grey
eyes
decorously
illumining
her
features
slightly
reddened
by
the
wind
and
the
husband
looked
back
at
her
calm
practical
protecting
they
were
very
much
alike
so
doubtless
he
looked
when
he
presented
himself
in
snowy
for
her
to
straighten
the
bow
of
his
white
tie
so
nightly
she
would
look
standing
before
the
mirror
fixing
his
gifts
upon
her
bosom
calm
proprietary
kind
he
passed
them
and
walked
behind
a
second
less
distinguished
couple
who
manifested
a
mutual
dislike
as
and
free
from
nonsense
as
the
unruffled
satisfaction
of
the
first
this
dislike
was
just
as
healthy
and
produced
in
shelton
about
the
same
sensation
it
was
like
knocking
at
a
door
looking
at
a
circle
couple
after
couple
all
the
same
no
heads
toes
angles
of
their
souls
stuck
out
anywhere
in
the
sea
of
their
environments
they
were
drowned
no
leg
braved
the
air
no
arm
emerged
wet
and
naked
waving
at
the
skies
aristocrats
workmen
officials
they
were
all
respectable
and
he
himself
as
respectable
as
any
he
returned
thus
moody
to
his
rooms
and
with
the
impetuosity
which
distinguished
him
when
about
to
do
an
unwise
thing
he
seized
a
pen
and
poured
out
before
antonia
some
of
his
impressions
mean
is
the
word
darling
we
are
mean
that
what
the
matter
with
us
dukes
and
dustmen
the
whole
human
species
as
mean
as
caterpillars
to
secure
our
own
property
and
our
own
comfort
to
dole
out
our
sympathy
according
to
rule
just
so
that
it
wo
really
hurt
us
is
what
we
all
after
there
something
about
human
nature
that
is
awfully
repulsive
and
the
healthier
people
are
the
more
repulsive
they
seem
to
me
to
be
he
paused
biting
his
pen
had
he
one
acquaintance
who
would
not
counsel
him
to
see
a
doctor
for
writing
in
that
style
how
would
the
world
go
round
how
could
society
exist
without
practical
ability
and
the
lack
of
sympathy
he
looked
out
of
the
open
window
down
in
the
street
a
footman
was
settling
the
rug
over
the
knees
of
a
lady
in
a
carriage
and
the
decorous
immovability
of
both
their
faces
which
were
clearly
visible
to
him
was
like
a
portion
of
some
engine
he
got
up
and
walked
up
and
down
his
rooms
in
a
narrow
square
skirting
belgravia
were
unchanged
since
the
death
of
his
father
had
made
him
a
man
of
means
selected
for
their
centrality
they
were
furnished
in
a
very
miscellaneous
way
they
were
not
bare
but
close
inspection
revealed
that
everything
was
damaged
more
or
less
and
there
was
absolutely
nothing
that
seemed
to
have
an
interest
taken
in
it
his
goods
were
accidents
presents
or
the
haphazard
acquisitions
of
a
pressing
need
nothing
of
course
was
frowsy
but
everything
was
somewhat
dusty
as
if
belonging
to
a
man
who
never
rebuked
a
servant
above
all
there
was
nothing
that
indicated
hobbies
three
days
later
he
had
her
answer
to
his
letter
i
do
think
i
understand
what
you
mean
by
the
healthier
people
are
the
more
repulsive
they
seem
to
be
one
must
be
healthy
to
be
perfect
must
one
i
do
like
unhealthy
people
i
had
to
play
on
that
wretched
piano
after
reading
your
letter
it
made
me
feel
unhappy
i
been
having
a
splendid
lot
of
tennis
lately
got
the
lifting
stroke
at
last
hurrah
by
the
same
post
too
came
the
following
note
in
an
autocratic
writing
dear
bird
for
this
was
shelton
college
nickname
my
wife
has
gone
down
to
her
people
so
i
garcon
for
a
few
days
if
you
nothing
better
to
do
come
and
dine
at
seven
and
go
to
the
theatre
it
ages
since
i
saw
you
yours
as
ever
halidome
shelton
had
nothing
better
to
do
for
pleasant
were
his
friend
halidome
dinners
at
seven
therefore
he
went
to
chester
square
his
friend
was
in
his
study
reading
matthew
arnold
by
the
light
of
an
electric
lamp
the
walls
of
the
room
were
hung
with
costly
etchings
arranged
with
solid
and
unfailing
taste
from
the
carving
of
the
to
the
binding
of
the
books
from
the
meerschaums
to
the
chased
everything
displayed
an
unpretentious
luxury
an
order
and
a
finish
significant
of
life
completely
under
rule
of
thumb
everything
had
been
collected
the
collector
rose
as
shelton
entered
a
fine
figure
of
a
man
clean
shaven
with
dark
hair
a
roman
nose
good
eyes
and
the
rather
weighty
dignity
of
attitude
which
comes
from
the
assurance
that
one
is
in
the
right
taking
shelton
by
the
lapel
he
drew
him
into
the
radius
of
the
lamp
where
he
examined
him
smiling
a
slow
smile
glad
to
see
you
old
chap
i
rather
like
your
beard
he
said
with
genial
brusqueness
and
nothing
perhaps
could
better
have
summed
up
his
faculty
for
forming
independent
judgments
which
shelton
found
so
admirable
he
made
no
apology
for
the
smallness
of
the
dinner
which
consisting
of
eight
courses
and
three
wines
served
by
a
butler
and
one
footman
smacked
of
the
same
perfection
as
the
furniture
in
fact
he
never
apologised
for
anything
except
with
a
jovial
brusqueness
that
was
worse
than
the
offence
the
suave
and
reasonable
weight
of
his
dislikes
and
his
approvals
stirred
shelton
up
to
feel
ironical
and
insignificant
but
whether
from
a
sense
of
the
solid
humane
and
healthy
quality
of
his
friend
egoism
or
merely
from
the
fact
that
this
friendship
had
been
long
in
bottle
he
did
not
resent
his
mixed
sensations
by
the
way
i
congratulate
you
old
chap
said
halidome
while
driving
to
the
theatre
there
was
no
vulgar
hurry
about
his
congratulations
no
more
than
about
himself
they
awfully
nice
people
the
a
sense
of
having
had
a
seal
put
on
his
choice
came
over
shelton
where
are
you
going
to
live
you
ought
to
come
down
and
live
near
us
there
are
some
ripping
houses
to
be
had
down
there
it
really
a
ripping
neighbourhood
have
you
chucked
the
bar
you
ought
to
do
something
you
know
it
be
fatal
for
you
to
have
nothing
to
do
i
tell
you
what
bird
you
ought
to
stand
for
the
county
but
before
shelton
had
replied
they
reached
the
theatre
and
their
energies
were
spent
in
sidling
to
their
stalls
he
had
time
to
pass
his
neighbours
in
review
before
the
play
began
seated
next
to
him
was
a
lady
with
large
healthy
shoulders
displayed
with
splendid
liberality
beyond
her
a
husband
with
drooping
moustache
and
a
bald
head
beyond
him
again
two
men
whom
he
had
known
at
eton
one
of
them
had
a
face
dark
hair
and
a
complexion
his
small
mouth
with
its
upper
lip
pushed
out
above
the
lower
his
eyelids
a
little
drooped
over
his
watchful
eyes
gave
him
a
satirical
and
resolute
expression
i
got
hold
of
your
tail
old
fellow
he
seemed
to
say
as
though
he
were
always
busy
with
the
catching
of
some
kind
of
fox
the
other
goggling
eyes
rested
on
shelton
with
a
chaffing
smile
his
thick
sleek
hair
brushed
with
water
and
parted
in
the
middle
his
neat
moustache
and
admirable
waistcoat
suggested
the
sort
of
dandyism
that
despises
women
from
his
recognition
of
these
old
schoolfellows
shelton
turned
to
look
at
halidome
who
having
cleared
his
throat
was
staring
straight
before
him
at
the
curtain
antonia
words
kept
running
in
her
lover
head
i
do
like
unhealthy
well
all
these
people
anyway
were
healthy
they
looked
as
if
they
had
defied
the
elements
to
endow
them
with
a
spark
of
anything
but
health
just
then
the
curtain
rose
slowly
unwillingly
for
he
was
of
a
trustful
disposition
shelton
recognised
that
this
play
was
one
of
those
masterpieces
of
the
modern
drama
whose
characters
were
drawn
on
the
principle
that
men
were
made
for
morals
rather
than
morals
made
by
men
and
he
watched
the
play
unfold
with
all
its
careful
sandwiching
of
grave
and
gay
a
married
woman
anxious
to
be
ridded
of
her
husband
was
the
pivot
of
the
story
and
a
number
of
scenes
ingeniously
contrived
with
a
hundred
reasons
why
this
desire
was
wrong
and
inexpedient
were
revealed
to
shelton
eyes
these
reasons
issued
mainly
from
the
mouth
of
a
old
gentleman
who
seemed
to
play
the
part
of
a
sort
of
moral
salesman
he
turned
to
halidome
and
whispered
can
you
stand
that
old
woman
his
friend
fixed
his
fine
eyes
on
him
wonderingly
what
old
woman
why
the
old
ass
with
the
platitudes
halidome
countenance
grew
cold
a
little
shocked
as
though
he
had
been
assailed
in
person
do
you
mean
pirbright
he
said
i
think
he
shelton
turned
to
the
play
rebuffed
he
felt
guilty
of
a
breach
of
manners
sitting
as
he
was
in
one
of
his
friend
stalls
and
he
naturally
set
to
work
to
watch
the
play
more
critically
than
ever
antonia
words
again
recurred
to
him
i
do
like
unhealthy
people
and
they
seemed
to
throw
a
sudden
light
upon
this
play
it
was
healthy
the
scene
was
a
softly
lighted
by
electric
lamps
with
a
cat
shelton
could
not
decide
whether
she
was
real
or
not
asleep
upon
the
mat
the
husband
a
healthy
man
in
evening
dress
was
drinking
off
neat
whisky
he
put
down
his
tumbler
and
deliberately
struck
a
match
then
with
even
greater
deliberation
he
lit
a
cigarette
shelton
was
no
inexperienced
he
shifted
his
elbows
for
he
felt
that
something
was
about
to
happen
and
when
the
match
was
pitched
into
the
fire
he
leaned
forward
in
his
seat
the
husband
poured
more
whisky
out
drank
it
at
a
draught
and
walked
towards
the
door
then
turning
to
the
audience
as
if
to
admit
them
to
the
secret
of
some
tremendous
resolution
he
puffed
at
them
a
puff
of
smoke
he
left
the
room
returned
and
once
more
filled
his
glass
a
lady
now
entered
pale
of
face
and
dark
of
eye
his
wife
the
husband
crossed
the
stage
and
stood
before
the
fire
his
legs
astride
in
the
attitude
which
somehow
shelton
had
felt
sure
he
would
assume
he
spoke
come
in
and
shut
the
shelton
suddenly
perceived
that
he
was
face
to
face
with
one
of
those
dumb
moments
in
which
two
people
declare
their
inextinguishable
hatred
the
hatred
underlying
the
sexual
intimacy
of
two
creatures
and
he
was
suddenly
reminded
of
a
scene
he
had
once
witnessed
in
a
restaurant
he
remembered
with
extreme
minuteness
how
the
woman
and
the
man
had
sat
facing
each
other
across
the
narrow
patch
of
white
emblazoned
by
a
candle
with
cheap
shades
and
a
thin
green
vase
with
yellow
flowers
he
remembered
the
curious
scornful
anger
of
their
voices
subdued
so
that
only
a
few
words
reached
him
he
remembered
the
cold
loathing
in
their
eyes
and
above
all
he
remembered
his
impression
that
this
sort
of
scene
happened
between
them
every
other
day
and
would
continue
so
to
happen
and
as
he
put
on
his
overcoat
and
paid
his
bill
he
had
asked
himself
why
in
the
name
of
decency
do
they
go
on
living
together
and
now
he
thought
as
he
listened
to
the
two
players
wrangling
on
the
stage
what
the
good
of
all
this
talk
there
something
here
past
the
curtain
came
down
upon
the
act
and
he
looked
at
the
lady
next
him
she
was
shrugging
her
shoulders
at
her
husband
whose
face
was
healthy
and
offended
i
do
dislike
these
unhealthy
women
he
was
saying
but
catching
shelton
eye
he
turned
square
in
his
seat
and
sniffed
ironically
the
face
of
shelton
friend
beyond
composed
satirical
as
ever
was
clothed
with
a
mask
of
scornful
curiosity
as
if
he
had
been
listening
to
something
that
had
displeased
him
not
a
little
the
man
was
yawning
shelton
turned
to
halidome
can
you
stand
this
sort
of
thing
said
he
no
i
call
that
scene
a
bit
too
hot
replied
his
friend
shelton
wriggled
he
had
meant
to
say
it
was
not
hot
enough
i
bet
you
anything
he
said
i
know
what
going
to
happen
now
you
have
that
old
ass
what
his
name
lunching
off
cutlets
and
champagne
to
fortify
himself
for
a
lecture
to
the
wife
he
show
her
how
unhealthy
her
feelings
are
i
know
him
and
he
take
her
hand
and
say
lady
is
there
anything
in
this
poor
world
but
the
good
opinion
of
society
and
he
pretend
to
laugh
at
himself
for
saying
it
but
you
see
perfectly
well
that
the
old
woman
means
it
and
then
he
put
her
into
a
set
of
circumstances
that
are
her
own
but
his
version
of
them
and
show
her
the
only
way
of
salvation
is
to
kiss
her
husband
and
shelton
grinned
anyway
i
bet
you
anything
he
takes
her
hand
and
says
halidome
turned
on
him
the
disapproval
of
his
eyes
and
again
he
said
i
think
pirbright
ripping
but
as
shelton
had
predicted
so
it
turned
out
amidst
great
applause
chapter
v
the
good
citizen
leaving
the
theatre
they
paused
a
moment
in
the
hall
to
don
their
coats
a
stream
of
people
with
spotless
bosoms
eddied
round
the
doors
as
if
in
momentary
dread
of
leaving
this
hothouse
of
false
morals
and
emotions
for
the
wet
gusty
streets
where
human
plants
thrive
and
die
human
weeds
flourish
and
fade
under
the
fresh
impartial
skies
the
lights
revealed
innumerable
solemn
faces
gleamed
innumerably
on
jewels
on
the
silk
of
hats
then
passed
to
whiten
a
pavement
wet
with
rain
to
flare
on
horses
on
the
visages
of
cabmen
and
stray
queer
objects
that
do
not
bear
the
light
shall
we
walk
asked
halidome
has
it
ever
struck
you
answered
shelton
that
in
a
play
nowadays
there
always
a
of
scandalmongers
which
seems
to
have
acquired
the
attitude
of
god
halidome
cleared
his
throat
and
there
was
something
portentous
in
the
sound
you
so
d
fastidious
was
his
answer
i
a
prejudice
for
keeping
the
two
things
separate
went
on
shelton
that
ending
makes
me
why
replied
halidome
what
other
end
is
possible
you
do
want
a
play
to
leave
you
with
a
bad
taste
in
your
but
this
halidome
increased
his
stride
already
much
too
long
for
in
his
walk
as
in
all
other
phases
of
his
life
he
found
it
necessary
to
be
in
front
how
do
you
mean
he
asked
urbanely
it
better
than
the
woman
making
a
fool
of
i
thinking
of
the
what
man
the
what
the
matter
with
him
he
was
a
bit
of
a
bounder
i
ca
understand
any
man
wanting
to
live
with
a
woman
who
want
some
note
of
battle
in
shelton
voice
rather
than
the
sentiment
itself
caused
his
friend
to
reply
with
dignity
there
a
lot
of
nonsense
talked
about
that
sort
of
thing
women
really
care
it
only
what
put
into
their
that
much
the
same
as
saying
to
a
starving
man
do
really
want
anything
it
only
what
put
into
your
head
you
are
begging
the
question
my
but
nothing
was
more
calculated
to
annoy
halidome
than
to
tell
him
he
was
begging
the
question
for
he
prided
himself
on
being
strong
in
logic
that
be
d
he
said
not
at
all
old
chap
here
is
a
case
where
a
woman
wants
her
freedom
and
you
merely
answer
that
she
dogs
want
women
like
that
are
impossible
better
leave
them
out
of
shelton
pondered
this
and
smiled
he
had
recollected
an
acquaintance
of
his
own
who
when
his
wife
had
left
him
invented
the
theory
that
she
was
mad
and
this
struck
him
now
as
funny
but
then
he
thought
poor
devil
he
was
bound
to
call
her
mad
if
he
did
it
would
be
confessing
himself
distasteful
however
true
you
ca
expect
a
man
to
consider
himself
but
a
glance
at
his
friend
eye
warned
him
that
he
too
might
think
his
wife
mad
in
such
a
case
surely
he
said
even
if
she
his
wife
a
man
bound
to
behave
like
a
depends
on
whether
she
behaves
like
a
does
it
i
do
see
the
halidome
paused
in
the
act
of
turning
the
in
his
door
there
was
a
rather
angry
smile
in
his
fine
eyes
my
dear
chap
he
said
you
too
sentimental
the
word
sentimental
nettled
shelton
a
gentleman
either
is
a
gentleman
or
he
is
what
has
it
to
do
with
the
way
other
people
behave
halidome
turned
the
key
in
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
into
his
hall
where
the
firelight
fell
on
the
decanters
and
huge
chairs
drawn
towards
the
blaze
no
bird
he
said
resuming
his
urbanity
and
gathering
his
in
his
hands
it
all
very
well
to
talk
but
wait
until
married
a
man
must
be
master
and
show
it
an
idea
occurred
to
shelton
look
here
hal
he
said
what
should
you
do
if
your
wife
got
tired
of
you
the
expression
on
halidome
face
was
a
mixture
of
amusement
and
contempt
i
do
mean
anything
personal
of
course
but
apply
the
situation
to
halidome
took
out
a
toothpick
used
it
brusquely
and
responded
i
should
stand
any
humbug
take
her
travelling
shake
her
mind
up
she
soon
come
but
suppose
she
really
loathed
you
halidome
cleared
his
throat
the
idea
was
so
obviously
indecent
how
could
anybody
loathe
him
with
great
composure
however
regarding
shelton
as
if
he
were
a
forward
but
amusing
child
he
answered
there
are
a
great
many
things
to
be
taken
into
it
appears
to
me
said
shelton
to
be
a
question
of
common
pride
how
can
you
ask
anything
of
a
woman
who
does
want
to
give
his
friend
voice
became
judicial
a
man
ought
not
to
suffer
he
said
poring
over
his
whisky
because
a
woman
gets
hysteria
you
have
to
think
of
society
your
children
house
money
arrangements
a
thousand
things
it
all
very
well
to
talk
how
do
you
like
this
whisky
the
part
of
the
good
citizen
in
fact
said
shelton
returned
his
friend
i
believe
in
justice
before
he
drank
and
callously
blew
smoke
at
shelton
besides
there
are
many
people
with
religious
views
about
it
always
seemed
to
me
said
shelton
to
be
quaint
that
people
should
assert
that
marriage
gives
them
the
right
to
eye
for
an
eye
and
call
themselves
christians
did
you
ever
know
anybody
stand
on
their
rights
except
out
of
wounded
pride
or
for
the
sake
of
their
own
comfort
let
them
call
their
reasons
what
they
like
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
that
it
i
do
know
about
that
said
halidome
more
and
more
superior
as
shelton
grew
more
warm
when
you
stand
on
your
rights
you
do
it
for
the
sake
of
society
as
well
as
for
your
own
if
you
want
to
do
away
with
marriage
why
do
you
say
so
but
i
do
said
shelton
is
it
likely
why
i
going
he
stopped
without
adding
the
words
to
be
married
myself
for
it
suddenly
occurred
to
him
that
the
reason
was
not
the
most
lofty
and
philosophic
in
the
world
all
i
can
say
is
he
went
on
soberly
that
you
make
a
horse
drink
by
driving
him
generosity
is
the
surest
way
of
tightening
the
knot
with
people
who
any
sense
of
decency
as
to
the
rest
the
chief
thing
is
to
prevent
their
halidome
smiled
you
a
rum
chap
he
said
shelton
jerked
his
cigarette
into
the
fire
i
tell
you
what
for
late
at
night
a
certain
power
of
vision
came
to
him
it
humbug
to
talk
of
doing
things
for
the
sake
of
society
nothing
but
the
instinct
to
keep
our
own
heads
above
the
but
halidome
remained
unruffled
all
right
he
said
call
it
that
i
do
see
why
i
should
go
to
the
wall
it
would
do
any
you
admit
then
said
shelton
that
our
morality
is
the
sum
total
of
everybody
private
instinct
of
halidome
stretched
his
splendid
frame
and
yawned
i
do
know
he
began
that
i
should
quite
call
it
that
but
the
compelling
complacency
of
his
fine
eyes
the
dignified
posture
of
his
healthy
body
the
lofty
slope
of
his
narrow
forehead
the
perfectly
humane
look
of
his
cultivated
brutality
struck
shelton
as
ridiculous
hang
it
hall
he
cried
jumping
from
his
chair
what
an
old
fraud
you
are
i
be
no
look
here
said
halidome
the
faintest
shade
of
doubt
had
appeared
upon
his
face
he
took
shelton
by
a
lapel
you
quite
wrong
very
likely
old
chap
shelton
walked
home
letting
the
spring
wind
into
him
it
was
saturday
and
he
passed
many
silent
couples
in
every
little
patch
of
shadow
he
could
see
two
forms
standing
or
sitting
close
together
and
in
their
presence
words
the
impostors
seemed
to
hold
their
tongues
the
wind
rustled
the
buds
the
stars
one
moment
bright
as
diamonds
vanished
the
next
in
the
lower
streets
a
large
part
of
the
world
was
under
the
influence
of
drink
but
by
this
shelton
was
far
from
being
troubled
it
seemed
better
than
drama
than
men
unruffled
women
and
padded
points
of
view
better
than
the
immaculate
solidity
of
his
friend
possessions
so
he
reflected
it
right
for
every
reason
social
religious
and
convenient
to
inflict
one
society
where
it
not
desired
there
are
obviously
advantages
about
the
married
state
charming
to
feel
respectable
while
you
acting
in
a
way
that
in
any
other
walk
of
life
would
bring
on
you
contempt
if
old
halidome
showed
that
he
was
tired
of
me
and
i
continued
to
visit
him
he
think
me
a
bit
of
a
cad
but
if
his
wife
were
to
tell
him
she
could
stand
him
he
still
consider
himself
a
perfect
gentleman
if
he
persisted
in
giving
her
the
burden
of
his
society
and
he
has
the
cheek
to
bring
religion
into
it
a
religion
that
says
unto
others
but
in
this
he
was
unjust
to
halidome
forgetting
how
impossible
it
was
for
him
to
believe
that
a
woman
could
not
stand
him
he
reached
his
rooms
and
the
more
freely
to
enjoy
the
clear
lamplight
the
soft
gusty
breeze
and
waning
turmoil
of
the
streets
waited
a
moment
before
entering
i
wonder
thought
he
if
i
shall
turn
out
a
cad
when
i
marry
like
that
chap
in
the
play
it
natural
we
all
want
our
money
worth
our
pound
of
flesh
pity
we
use
such
fine
words
religion
morality
humbug
he
went
in
and
throwing
his
window
open
remained
there
a
long
time
his
figure
outlined
against
the
lighted
room
for
the
benefit
of
the
dark
square
below
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
down
a
reflective
frown
about
his
eyes
a
old
ruffian
a
policeman
and
a
man
in
a
straw
hat
had
stopped
below
and
were
holding
a
palaver
yus
the
old
ruffian
said
i
a
rackety
old
blank
but
what
i
say
is
if
we
wus
all
alike
this
would
be
a
world
they
went
their
way
and
before
the
listener
eyes
there
rose
face
with
its
unruffled
brow
halidome
all
health
and
dignity
the
forehead
of
the
man
with
its
line
of
hair
parted
in
the
centre
and
brushed
across
a
light
seemed
to
illumine
the
plane
of
their
existence
as
the
electric
lamp
with
the
green
shade
had
illumined
the
pages
of
the
matthew
arnold
serene
before
shelton
vision
lay
that
elysium
untouched
by
passion
or
extremes
of
any
kind
autocratic
complacent
possessive
and
as
any
midland
landscape
healthy
wealthy
wise
no
room
but
for
perfection
the
survival
of
the
fittest
the
part
of
the
good
citizen
he
thought
no
if
we
were
all
alike
this
would
be
a
world
chapter
vi
marriage
settlement
my
dear
richard
wrote
shelton
uncle
the
next
day
i
shall
be
glad
to
see
you
at
three
afternoon
upon
the
question
of
your
marriage
settlement
at
that
hour
accordingly
shelton
made
his
way
to
lincoln
inn
fields
where
in
fat
black
letters
the
names
paramor
and
herring
commissioners
for
oaths
were
written
on
the
wall
of
a
stone
entrance
he
ascended
the
solid
steps
with
nervousness
and
by
a
small
boy
was
introduced
to
a
back
room
on
the
first
floor
here
seated
at
a
table
in
the
very
centre
as
if
he
thereby
better
controlled
his
universe
a
gentleman
without
a
beard
was
writing
he
paused
ow
richard
he
said
glad
to
see
you
sir
take
a
chair
your
uncle
will
be
disengaged
in
a
minute
and
in
the
tone
of
his
allusion
to
his
employer
was
the
satirical
approval
that
comes
with
long
and
faithful
service
he
will
do
everything
himself
he
went
on
screwing
up
his
sly
greenish
honest
eyes
and
he
not
a
young
shelton
never
saw
his
uncle
clerk
without
marvelling
at
the
prosperity
deepening
upon
his
face
in
place
of
the
look
of
harassment
which
on
most
faces
begins
to
grow
after
the
age
of
fifty
his
old
countenance
as
though
in
sympathy
with
the
nation
had
expanded
a
little
greasily
a
little
genially
a
little
coarsely
every
time
he
met
it
a
contemptuous
tolerance
for
people
who
were
not
getting
on
was
spreading
beneath
its
surface
it
left
each
time
a
deeper
feeling
that
its
owner
could
never
be
in
the
wrong
i
hope
you
well
sir
he
resumed
most
important
for
you
to
have
your
health
now
you
and
feeling
for
the
delicate
way
to
put
it
he
involuntarily
winked
to
become
a
family
man
we
saw
it
in
the
paper
my
wife
said
to
me
the
other
morning
at
breakfast
here
a
richard
paramor
shelton
goin
to
be
married
is
that
any
relative
of
your
mr
shelton
dear
i
said
to
her
the
very
man
it
disquieted
shelton
to
perceive
that
his
old
friend
did
not
pass
the
whole
of
his
life
at
that
table
writing
in
the
centre
of
the
room
but
that
somewhere
vistas
of
little
grey
houses
rose
before
his
eyes
he
actually
lived
another
life
where
someone
called
him
bob
and
this
too
was
a
revelation
bob
why
of
course
it
was
the
only
name
for
him
a
bell
rang
that
your
uncle
and
again
the
head
clerk
voice
sounded
ironical
he
seemed
to
clip
off
intercourse
as
one
clips
off
electric
light
shelton
left
him
writing
and
preceded
the
boy
to
an
enormous
room
in
the
front
where
his
uncle
waited
edmund
paramor
was
a
and
upright
man
of
seventy
whose
brown
face
was
perfectly
his
grey
silky
hair
was
brushed
in
a
cock
comb
from
his
fine
forehead
bald
on
the
left
side
he
stood
before
the
hearth
facing
the
room
and
his
figure
had
the
springy
abruptness
of
men
who
can
not
fatten
there
was
a
certain
youthfulness
too
in
his
eyes
yet
they
had
a
look
as
though
he
had
been
through
fire
and
his
mouth
curled
at
the
corners
in
surprising
smiles
the
room
was
like
the
man
morally
large
void
of
and
almost
void
of
furniture
no
tin
boxes
were
ranged
against
the
walls
no
papers
littered
up
the
table
a
single
bookcase
contained
a
complete
edition
of
the
law
reports
and
resting
on
the
law
directory
was
a
single
red
rose
in
a
glass
of
water
it
looked
the
room
of
one
with
a
sober
magnanimity
who
went
to
the
heart
of
things
despised
haggling
and
before
whose
smiles
the
more
immediate
kinds
of
humbug
faded
well
dick
said
he
how
your
mother
shelton
replied
that
his
mother
was
all
right
tell
her
that
i
going
to
sell
her
easterns
after
all
and
put
into
this
brass
thing
you
can
say
it
safe
from
shelton
made
a
face
mother
said
he
always
believes
things
are
his
uncle
looked
through
him
with
his
keen
glance
and
up
went
the
corners
of
his
mouth
she
splendid
he
said
yes
said
shelton
the
transaction
however
did
not
interest
him
his
uncle
judgment
in
such
matters
had
a
breezy
soundness
he
would
never
dream
of
questioning
well
about
your
settlement
and
touching
a
bell
three
times
paramor
walked
up
and
down
the
room
bring
me
the
draft
of
richard
marriage
the
stalwart
commissionaire
reappearing
with
a
document
now
then
dick
said
paramor
she
not
bringing
anything
into
settlement
i
understand
how
that
i
did
want
it
replied
shelton
unaccountably
ashamed
paramor
lips
quivered
he
drew
the
draft
closer
took
up
a
blue
pencil
and
squeezing
shelton
arm
began
to
read
the
latter
following
his
uncle
rapid
exposition
of
the
clauses
was
relieved
when
he
paused
suddenly
if
you
die
and
she
marries
again
said
paramor
she
forfeits
her
life
interest
see
oh
said
shelton
wait
a
minute
uncle
paramor
waited
biting
his
pencil
a
smile
flickered
on
his
mouth
and
was
decorously
subdued
it
was
shelton
turn
to
walk
about
if
she
marries
again
he
repeated
to
himself
paramor
was
a
keen
fisherman
he
watched
his
nephew
as
he
might
have
watched
a
fish
he
had
just
landed
it
very
usual
he
remarked
shelton
took
another
turn
she
forfeits
thought
he
when
he
was
dead
he
would
have
no
other
way
of
seeing
that
she
continued
to
belong
to
him
exactly
paramor
haunting
eyes
were
fastened
on
his
nephew
face
well
my
dear
they
seemed
to
say
what
the
matter
exactly
why
should
she
have
his
money
if
she
married
again
she
would
forfeit
it
there
was
comfort
in
the
thought
shelton
came
back
and
carefully
reread
the
clause
to
put
the
thing
on
a
purely
business
basis
and
disguise
the
real
significance
of
what
was
passing
in
his
mind
if
i
die
and
she
marries
again
he
repeated
aloud
she
what
wiser
provision
for
a
man
passionately
in
love
could
possibly
have
been
devised
his
uncle
eye
travelled
beyond
him
humanely
turning
from
the
last
despairing
wriggles
of
his
fish
i
do
want
to
tie
her
said
shelton
suddenly
the
corners
of
paramour
mouth
flew
up
you
want
the
forfeiture
out
he
asked
the
blood
rushed
into
shelton
face
he
felt
he
had
been
detected
in
a
piece
of
sentiment
he
stammered
sure
quite
the
answer
was
a
little
sulky
her
uncle
pencil
descended
on
the
clause
and
he
resumed
the
reading
of
the
draft
but
shelton
could
not
follow
it
he
was
too
much
occupied
in
considering
exactly
why
paramor
had
been
amused
and
to
do
this
he
was
obliged
to
keep
his
eyes
upon
him
those
features
just
pleasantly
rugged
the
springy
poise
of
the
figure
the
hair
neither
straight
nor
curly
neither
short
nor
long
the
haunting
look
of
his
eyes
and
the
humorous
look
of
his
mouth
his
clothes
neither
shabby
nor
dandified
his
serviceable
fine
hands
above
all
the
equability
of
the
hovering
blue
pencil
conveyed
the
impression
of
a
perfect
balance
between
heart
and
head
sensibility
and
reason
theory
and
its
opposite
coverture
quoted
paramor
pausing
again
you
understand
of
course
if
you
do
get
on
and
separate
she
goes
on
taking
if
they
did
get
on
shelton
smiled
paramor
did
not
smile
and
again
shelton
had
the
sense
of
having
knocked
up
against
something
poised
but
firm
he
remarked
irritably
if
we
not
living
together
all
the
more
reason
for
her
having
this
time
his
uncle
smiled
it
was
difficult
for
shelton
to
feel
angry
at
that
ironic
merriment
with
its
sudden
ending
it
was
too
impersonal
to
irritate
it
was
too
concerned
with
human
nature
if
hum
it
came
to
the
other
thing
said
paramor
the
settlement
at
an
end
as
far
as
she
concerned
we
bound
to
look
at
every
case
you
know
old
the
memory
of
the
play
and
his
conversation
with
halidome
was
still
strong
in
shelton
he
was
not
one
of
those
who
could
not
face
the
notion
of
transferred
affections
at
a
safe
distance
all
right
uncle
ted
said
he
for
one
mad
moment
he
was
attacked
by
the
desire
to
throw
in
the
case
of
divorce
would
it
not
be
common
chivalry
to
make
her
independent
able
to
change
her
affections
if
she
wished
unhampered
by
monetary
troubles
you
only
needed
to
take
out
the
words
during
almost
anxiously
he
looked
into
his
uncle
face
there
was
no
meanness
there
but
neither
was
there
encouragement
in
that
comprehensive
brow
with
its
wide
sweep
of
hair
quixotism
it
seemed
to
say
has
merits
but
the
room
too
with
its
wide
horizon
and
tall
windows
looking
as
if
it
dealt
habitually
in
discouraged
him
innumerable
men
of
breeding
and
the
soundest
principles
must
have
bought
their
wives
in
here
it
was
perfumed
with
the
atmosphere
of
wisdom
and
the
aroma
of
precedent
was
strong
shelton
swerved
his
lance
and
once
more
settled
down
to
complete
the
purchase
of
his
wife
i
ca
conceive
what
you
in
such
a
hurry
for
you
not
going
to
be
married
till
the
autumn
said
paramor
finishing
at
last
replacing
the
blue
pencil
in
the
rack
he
took
the
red
rose
from
the
glass
and
sniffed
at
it
will
you
come
with
me
as
far
as
pall
mall
i
going
to
take
an
afternoon
off
too
cold
for
lord
i
suppose
they
walked
into
the
strand
have
you
seen
this
new
play
of
borogrove
asked
shelton
as
they
passed
the
theatre
to
which
he
had
been
with
halidome
i
never
go
to
modern
plays
replied
paramor
too
d
shelton
glanced
at
him
he
wore
his
hat
rather
far
back
on
his
head
his
eyes
haunted
the
street
in
front
he
had
shouldered
his
umbrella
psychology
not
in
your
line
uncle
ted
is
that
what
they
call
putting
into
words
things
that
ca
be
put
in
words
the
french
succeed
in
doing
it
replied
shelton
and
the
russians
why
should
we
paramor
stopped
to
look
in
at
a
fishmonger
what
right
for
the
french
and
russians
dick
he
said
is
wrong
for
us
when
we
begin
to
be
real
we
only
really
begin
to
be
false
i
should
like
to
have
had
the
catching
of
that
fellow
let
send
him
to
your
he
went
in
and
bought
a
salmon
now
my
dear
he
continued
as
they
went
on
do
you
tell
me
that
decent
for
men
and
women
on
the
stage
to
writhe
about
like
eels
is
life
bad
enough
already
it
suddenly
struck
shelton
that
for
all
his
smile
his
uncle
face
had
a
look
of
crucifixion
it
was
perhaps
only
the
stronger
sunlight
in
the
open
spaces
of
trafalgar
square
i
do
know
he
said
i
think
i
prefer
the
bad
endings
and
the
rest
said
paramor
pausing
under
one
of
nelson
lions
and
taking
shelton
by
a
button
truth
the
very
devil
he
stood
there
very
straight
his
eyes
haunting
his
nephew
face
there
seemed
to
shelton
a
touching
muddle
in
his
optimism
a
muddle
of
tenderness
and
of
intolerance
of
truth
and
like
the
lion
above
him
he
seemed
to
be
defying
life
to
make
him
look
at
her
no
my
dear
he
said
handing
sixpence
to
a
sweeper
feelings
are
snakes
only
fit
to
be
kept
in
bottles
with
tight
corks
you
wo
come
to
my
club
well
old
boy
my
love
to
your
mother
when
you
see
her
and
turning
up
the
square
he
left
shelton
to
go
on
to
his
own
club
feeling
that
he
had
parted
not
from
his
uncle
but
from
the
nation
of
which
they
were
both
members
by
birth
and
blood
and
education
chapter
vii
the
club
he
went
into
the
library
of
his
club
and
took
up
burke
peerage
the
words
his
uncle
had
said
to
him
on
hearing
his
engagement
had
been
these
dennant
are
those
the
holm
oaks
dennants
she
was
a
no
one
who
knew
paramor
connected
him
with
snobbery
but
there
had
been
an
ah
that
right
this
is
due
to
us
tone
about
the
saying
shelton
hunted
for
the
name
of
baltimore
charles
penguin
fifth
baron
baltimore
issue
alice
b
dennant
of
holm
oaks
cross
eaton
he
put
down
the
peerage
and
took
up
the
gentry
dennant
algernon
cuffe
eldest
son
of
the
late
algernon
cuffe
dennant
and
irene
daur
of
the
honble
philip
and
lady
lillian
march
mallow
ed
eton
and
ch
oxford
for
oxfordshire
residence
holm
oaks
etc
dropping
the
gentry
he
took
up
a
volume
of
the
nights
which
some
member
had
left
reposing
on
the
of
his
chair
but
instead
of
reading
he
kept
looking
round
the
room
in
almost
every
seat
reading
or
snoozing
were
gentlemen
who
in
their
own
estimation
might
have
married
penguins
for
the
first
time
it
struck
him
with
what
majestic
leisureliness
they
turned
the
pages
of
their
books
trifled
with
their
teacups
or
lightly
snored
yet
no
two
were
alike
a
tall
dark
moustache
thick
hair
and
red
smooth
cheeks
another
bald
with
stooping
shoulders
a
tremendous
old
buck
with
a
grey
pointed
beard
and
large
white
waistcoat
a
dapper
man
past
middle
age
whose
face
was
like
a
bird
a
long
sallow
misanthrope
and
a
sanguine
creature
fast
asleep
asleep
or
awake
reading
or
snoring
fat
or
thin
hairy
or
bald
the
insulation
of
their
red
or
pale
faces
was
complete
they
were
all
the
creatures
of
good
form
staring
at
them
or
reading
the
arabian
nights
shelton
spent
the
time
before
dinner
he
had
not
been
long
seated
in
the
when
a
distant
connection
strolled
up
and
took
the
next
table
ah
shelton
back
somebody
told
me
you
were
goin
round
the
he
scrutinised
the
menu
through
his
eyeglass
clear
soup
read
jellaby
speech
amusing
the
way
he
squashes
all
those
fellows
best
man
in
the
house
he
really
shelton
paused
in
the
assimilation
of
asparagus
he
too
had
been
in
the
habit
of
admiring
jellaby
but
now
he
wondered
why
the
red
and
shaven
face
beside
him
above
a
broad
pure
was
swollen
by
good
humour
his
small
very
usual
and
hard
eyes
were
fixed
introspectively
on
the
successful
process
of
his
eating
success
thought
shelton
suddenly
enlightened
success
is
what
we
admire
in
jellaby
we
all
want
success
yes
he
admitted
a
successful
oh
said
his
neighbour
i
forgot
you
in
the
other
camp
not
particularly
where
did
you
get
that
idea
his
neighbour
looked
round
negligently
oh
said
he
i
somehow
thought
so
and
shelton
almost
heard
him
adding
there
something
not
quite
sound
about
why
do
you
admire
jellaby
he
asked
knows
his
own
mind
replied
his
neighbour
it
more
than
the
others
do
this
whitebait
is
fit
for
cats
clever
fellow
jellaby
no
nonsense
about
him
have
you
ever
heard
him
speak
awful
good
sport
to
watch
him
sittin
on
the
opposition
a
poor
lot
they
are
and
he
laughed
either
from
appreciation
of
jellaby
sitting
on
a
small
minority
or
from
appreciation
of
the
champagne
bubbles
in
his
glass
minorities
are
always
depressing
said
shelton
dryly
eh
what
i
mean
said
shelton
it
irritating
to
look
at
people
who
have
a
chance
of
success
fellows
who
make
a
mess
of
things
fanatics
and
all
his
neighbour
turned
his
eyes
inquisitively
er
yes
quite
said
he
do
you
take
mint
sauce
it
the
best
part
of
lamb
i
always
the
great
room
with
its
countless
little
tables
arranged
so
that
every
man
might
have
the
support
of
the
gold
walls
to
his
back
began
to
regain
its
influence
on
shelton
how
many
times
had
he
not
sat
there
carefully
nodding
to
acquaintances
happy
if
he
got
the
table
he
was
used
to
a
paper
with
the
latest
racing
and
someone
to
gossip
with
who
was
not
a
bounder
while
the
sensation
of
having
drunk
enough
stole
over
him
happy
that
is
happy
as
a
horse
is
happy
who
never
leaves
his
stall
look
at
poor
little
bing
puffin
about
said
his
neighbour
pointing
to
a
weazened
hunchy
waiter
his
asthma
bad
you
can
hear
him
wheezin
from
the
he
seemed
amused
there
no
such
thing
as
moral
asthma
i
suppose
said
shelton
his
neighbour
dropped
his
eyeglass
here
take
this
away
it
overdone
said
he
bring
me
some
shelton
pushed
his
table
back
he
said
the
stilton
excellent
his
neighbour
raised
his
brows
and
dropped
his
eyes
again
upon
his
plate
in
the
hall
shelton
went
from
force
of
habit
to
the
and
took
his
weight
eleven
stone
he
thought
gone
up
and
clipping
a
cigar
he
sat
down
in
the
with
a
novel
after
half
an
hour
he
dropped
the
book
there
seemed
something
rather
fatuous
about
this
story
for
though
it
had
a
thrilling
plot
and
was
full
of
people
it
had
apparently
been
contrived
to
throw
no
light
on
anything
whatever
he
looked
at
the
author
name
everyone
was
highly
recommending
it
he
began
thinking
and
staring
at
the
fire
looking
up
he
saw
antonia
second
brother
a
young
man
in
the
rifles
bending
over
him
with
sunny
cheeks
and
lazy
smile
clearly
just
a
little
drunk
congratulate
you
old
chap
i
say
what
made
you
grow
that
beard
shelton
grinned
pillbottle
of
the
duchess
read
young
dennant
taking
up
the
book
you
been
reading
that
rippin
is
it
oh
ripping
replied
shelton
rippin
plot
when
you
get
hold
of
a
novel
you
do
want
any
rot
about
what
call
it
psychology
you
want
to
be
rather
murmured
shelton
that
an
awfully
good
bit
where
the
president
steals
her
diamonds
there
old
benjy
hallo
benjy
hallo
bill
old
man
this
benjy
was
a
young
creature
whose
face
and
voice
and
manner
were
a
perfect
blend
of
steel
and
geniality
in
addition
to
this
young
man
who
was
so
smooth
and
hard
and
cheery
a
grey
gentleman
with
misanthropic
eyes
called
stroud
came
up
together
with
another
man
of
shelton
age
with
a
moustache
and
a
bald
patch
the
size
of
a
who
might
be
seen
in
the
club
any
night
of
the
year
when
there
was
no
racing
out
of
reach
of
london
you
know
began
young
dennant
that
this
bounder
he
slapped
the
young
man
benjy
on
the
knee
is
going
to
be
spliced
miss
casserol
you
know
the
casserols
muncaster
by
jove
said
shelton
delighted
to
be
able
to
say
something
they
would
understand
young
champion
the
best
man
and
i
the
second
best
i
tell
you
what
old
chap
you
better
come
with
me
and
get
your
eye
in
you
wo
get
such
another
chance
of
practice
benjy
give
you
a
delighted
murmured
benjy
where
is
it
st
briabas
come
and
see
how
they
do
the
trick
i
call
for
you
at
one
we
have
some
lunch
and
go
together
again
he
patted
benjy
knee
shelton
nodded
his
assent
the
piquant
callousness
of
the
affair
had
made
him
shiver
and
furtively
he
eyed
the
steely
benjy
whose
suavity
had
never
wavered
and
who
appeared
to
take
a
greater
interest
in
some
approaching
race
than
in
his
coming
marriage
but
shelton
knew
from
his
own
sensations
that
this
could
not
really
be
the
case
it
was
merely
a
question
of
good
form
the
conceit
of
a
superior
breeding
the
duty
not
to
give
oneself
away
and
when
in
turn
he
marked
the
eyes
of
stroud
fixed
on
benjy
under
shaggy
brows
and
the
curious
greedy
glances
of
the
racing
man
he
felt
somehow
sorry
for
him
who
that
fellow
with
the
game
leg
i
always
seeing
him
about
asked
the
racing
man
and
shelton
saw
a
sallow
man
conspicuous
for
a
want
of
parting
in
his
hair
and
a
certain
restlessness
of
attitude
his
name
is
bayes
said
stroud
spends
half
his
time
among
the
chinese
must
have
a
grudge
against
them
and
now
he
got
his
leg
he
ca
go
there
any
chinese
what
does
he
do
to
them
bibles
or
guns
do
ask
me
an
looks
a
bit
of
a
bounder
said
the
racing
man
shelton
gazed
at
the
twitching
eyebrows
of
old
stroud
he
saw
at
once
how
it
must
annoy
a
man
who
had
a
billet
in
the
woods
and
forests
and
plenty
of
time
for
bridge
and
gossip
at
his
club
to
see
these
people
with
untidy
lives
a
minute
later
the
man
with
the
game
leg
passed
close
behind
his
chair
and
shelton
perceived
at
once
how
intelligible
the
resentment
of
his
was
he
had
eyes
which
not
uncommon
in
this
country
looked
like
fires
behind
steel
bars
he
seemed
the
very
kind
of
man
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
that
were
bad
form
a
man
who
might
even
go
as
far
as
chivalry
he
looked
straight
at
shelton
and
his
uncompromising
glance
gave
an
impression
of
fierce
loneliness
altogether
an
improper
person
to
belong
to
such
a
club
shelton
remembered
the
words
of
an
old
friend
of
his
father
yes
dick
all
sorts
of
fellows
belong
here
and
they
come
here
for
all
sorts
reasons
and
a
lot
of
em
come
because
they
nowhere
else
to
go
poor
beggars
and
glancing
from
the
man
with
the
game
leg
to
stroud
it
occurred
to
shelton
that
even
he
old
stroud
might
be
one
of
these
poor
beggars
one
never
knew
a
look
at
benjy
contained
and
cheery
restored
him
ah
the
lucky
devil
he
would
not
have
to
come
here
any
more
and
the
thought
of
the
last
evening
he
himself
would
be
spending
before
long
flooded
his
mind
with
a
sweetness
that
was
almost
pain
benjy
i
play
you
a
hundred
up
said
young
bill
dennant
stroud
and
the
racing
man
went
to
watch
the
game
shelton
was
left
once
more
to
reverie
good
form
thought
he
that
fellow
must
be
made
of
steel
go
on
somewhere
stick
about
half
the
night
playing
poker
or
some
such
he
crossed
over
to
the
window
rain
had
begun
to
fall
the
streets
looked
wild
and
draughty
the
cabmen
were
putting
on
their
coats
two
women
scurried
by
huddled
under
one
umbrella
and
a
scarecrow
lounged
past
with
a
surly
desperate
step
shelton
returning
to
his
chair
threaded
his
way
amongst
his
a
procession
of
old
school
and
college
friends
came
up
before
his
eyes
after
all
what
had
there
been
in
his
own
education
or
theirs
to
give
them
any
other
standard
than
this
good
form
what
had
there
been
to
teach
them
anything
of
life
their
imbecility
was
incredible
when
you
came
to
think
of
it
they
had
all
the
air
of
knowing
everything
and
really
they
knew
nothing
nothing
of
nature
art
or
the
emotions
nothing
of
the
bonds
that
bind
all
men
together
why
even
such
words
were
not
good
form
nothing
outside
their
little
circle
was
good
they
had
a
fixed
point
of
view
over
life
because
they
came
of
certain
schools
and
colleges
and
regiments
and
they
were
those
in
charge
of
the
state
of
laws
and
science
of
the
army
and
religion
well
it
was
their
system
the
system
not
to
start
too
young
to
form
healthy
fibre
and
let
the
develop
it
successful
he
thought
nearly
stumbling
over
a
pair
of
boots
belonging
to
a
member
with
gold
oh
it
successful
somebody
came
and
picked
up
from
the
table
the
very
volume
which
had
originally
inspired
this
train
of
thought
and
shelton
could
see
his
solemn
pleasure
as
he
read
in
the
white
of
his
eye
there
was
a
torpid
and
composed
abstraction
there
was
nothing
in
that
book
to
startle
him
or
make
him
think
the
member
with
the
patent
boots
came
up
and
began
talking
of
his
recent
visit
to
the
south
of
france
he
had
a
scandalous
anecdote
or
two
to
tell
and
his
broad
face
beamed
behind
his
gold
he
was
a
large
man
with
such
a
store
of
easy
worldly
humour
that
it
was
impossible
not
to
appreciate
his
gossip
he
gave
so
perfect
an
impression
of
enjoying
life
and
doing
himself
well
well
he
murmured
an
engagement
and
the
certainty
he
left
behind
that
his
engagement
must
be
charming
and
illicit
was
pleasant
to
the
soul
and
slowly
taking
up
his
glass
shelton
drank
the
sense
of
was
upon
him
his
superiority
to
these
his
soothed
him
he
saw
through
all
the
sham
of
this
club
life
the
meanness
of
this
worship
of
success
the
sham
of
novelists
good
form
and
the
terrific
decency
of
our
education
it
was
soothing
thus
to
see
through
things
soothing
thus
to
be
superior
and
from
the
soft
recesses
of
his
chair
he
puffed
out
smoke
and
stretched
his
limbs
toward
the
fire
and
the
fire
burned
back
at
him
with
a
discreet
and
venerable
glow
chapter
viii
the
wedding
punctual
to
his
word
bill
dennant
called
for
shelton
at
one
i
bet
old
benjy
feeling
a
bit
cheap
said
he
as
they
got
out
of
their
cab
at
the
church
door
and
passed
between
the
crowded
files
of
unelect
whose
eyes
so
curious
and
pitiful
devoured
them
from
the
pavement
the
ashen
face
of
a
woman
with
a
baby
in
her
arms
and
two
more
by
her
side
looked
as
eager
as
if
she
had
never
experienced
the
pangs
of
ragged
matrimony
shelton
went
in
inexplicably
uneasy
the
price
of
his
tie
was
their
board
and
lodging
for
a
week
he
followed
his
future
to
a
pew
on
the
bridegroom
side
for
with
intuitive
perception
of
the
sexes
endless
warfare
each
of
the
opposing
parties
to
this
contract
had
its
serried
battalion
the
arrows
of
whose
suspicion
kept
glancing
across
and
across
the
central
aisle
bill
dennant
eyes
began
to
twinkle
there
old
benjy
he
whispered
and
shelton
looked
at
the
hero
of
the
day
a
subdued
pallor
was
traceable
under
the
weathered
uniformity
of
his
shaven
face
but
the
artificial
smile
he
bent
upon
the
guests
had
its
wonted
steely
suavity
about
his
dress
and
his
neat
figure
was
that
studied
ease
which
lifts
men
from
the
ruck
of
common
bridegrooms
there
were
no
holes
in
his
armour
through
which
the
impertinent
might
pry
good
old
benjy
whispered
young
dennant
i
say
they
look
a
bit
short
of
class
those
shelton
who
was
acquainted
with
this
family
smiled
the
sensuous
sanctity
all
round
had
begun
to
influence
him
a
perfume
of
flowers
and
dresses
fought
with
the
natural
odour
of
the
church
the
rustle
of
whisperings
and
skirts
struck
through
the
native
silence
of
the
aisles
and
shelton
idly
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
lady
in
the
pew
in
front
without
in
the
least
desiring
to
make
a
speculation
of
this
sort
he
wondered
whether
her
face
was
as
charming
as
the
lines
of
her
back
in
their
delicate
setting
of
pearl
grey
his
glance
wandered
to
the
chancel
with
its
stacks
of
flowers
to
the
grave
business
faces
of
the
presiding
priests
till
the
organ
began
rolling
out
the
wedding
march
they
off
whispered
young
dermant
shelton
was
conscious
of
a
shiver
running
through
the
audience
which
reminded
him
of
a
bullfight
he
had
seen
in
spain
the
bride
came
slowly
up
the
aisle
antonia
will
look
like
that
he
thought
and
the
church
will
be
filled
with
people
like
this
she
be
a
show
to
them
the
bride
was
opposite
him
now
and
by
an
instinct
of
common
chivalry
he
turned
away
his
eyes
it
seemed
to
him
a
shame
to
look
at
that
downcast
head
above
the
silver
mystery
of
her
perfect
raiment
the
modest
head
full
doubtless
of
devotion
and
pure
yearnings
the
stately
head
where
no
such
thought
as
how
am
i
looking
this
day
of
all
days
before
all
london
had
ever
entered
the
proud
head
which
no
such
fear
as
how
am
i
carrying
it
off
could
surely
be
besmirching
he
saw
below
the
surface
of
this
drama
played
before
his
eyes
and
set
his
face
as
a
man
might
who
found
himself
assisting
at
a
sacrifice
the
words
fell
unrelenting
on
his
ears
for
better
for
worse
for
richer
for
poorer
in
sickness
and
in
health
and
opening
the
prayer
book
he
found
the
marriage
service
which
he
had
not
looked
at
since
he
was
a
boy
and
as
he
read
he
had
some
very
curious
sensations
all
this
would
soon
be
happening
to
himself
he
went
on
reading
in
a
kind
of
stupor
until
aroused
by
his
companion
whispering
no
luck
all
around
there
rose
a
rustling
of
skirts
he
saw
a
tall
figure
mount
the
pulpit
and
stand
motionless
massive
and
sunken
of
eye
he
towered
in
snowy
cambric
and
a
crimson
stole
above
the
blackness
of
his
rostrum
it
seemed
he
had
been
chosen
for
his
beauty
shelton
was
still
gazing
at
the
stitching
of
his
gloves
when
once
again
the
organ
played
the
wedding
march
all
were
smiling
and
a
few
were
weeping
craning
their
heads
towards
the
bride
carnival
of
emotions
thought
shelton
and
he
too
craned
his
head
and
brushed
his
hat
then
smirking
at
his
friends
he
made
his
way
towards
the
door
in
the
casserols
house
he
found
himself
at
last
going
round
the
presents
with
the
eldest
casserol
surviving
a
tall
girl
in
pale
violet
who
had
been
chief
bridesmaid
did
it
go
off
well
shelton
she
was
saying
oh
awfully
i
always
think
it
so
awkward
for
the
man
waiting
up
there
for
the
bride
to
yes
murmured
shelton
do
you
think
it
smart
the
bridesmaids
having
no
hats
shelton
had
not
noticed
this
improvement
but
he
agreed
that
was
my
idea
i
think
it
very
chic
they
had
fifteen
dull
is
it
by
jove
shelton
hastened
to
remark
oh
its
fearfully
useful
to
have
a
lot
of
things
you
do
want
of
course
you
change
them
for
those
you
the
whole
of
london
seemed
to
have
disgorged
its
shops
into
this
room
he
looked
at
miss
casserol
face
and
was
greatly
struck
by
the
shrewd
acquisitiveness
of
her
small
eyes
is
that
your
future
she
asked
pointing
to
bill
dennant
with
a
little
movement
of
her
chin
i
think
he
such
a
bright
boy
i
want
you
both
to
come
to
dinner
and
help
to
keep
things
jolly
it
so
deadly
after
a
and
shelton
said
they
would
they
adjourned
to
the
hall
now
to
wait
for
the
bride
departure
her
face
as
she
came
down
the
stairs
was
impassive
gay
with
a
furtive
trouble
in
the
eyes
and
once
more
shelton
had
the
odd
sensation
of
having
sinned
against
his
manhood
jammed
close
to
him
was
her
old
nurse
whose
puffy
yellow
face
was
pouting
with
emotion
while
tears
rolled
from
her
eyes
she
was
trying
to
say
something
but
in
the
hubbub
her
farewell
was
lost
there
was
a
scamper
to
the
carriage
a
flurry
of
rice
and
flowers
the
shoe
was
flung
against
the
sharply
window
then
benjy
shaven
face
was
seen
a
moment
bland
and
steely
the
footman
folded
his
arms
and
with
a
solemn
crunch
the
brougham
wheels
rolled
away
how
splendidly
it
went
off
said
a
voice
on
shelton
right
she
looked
a
little
pale
said
a
voice
on
left
he
put
his
hand
up
to
his
forehead
behind
him
the
old
nurse
sniffed
dick
said
young
dennant
in
his
ear
this
is
good
enough
i
vote
we
shelton
assenting
they
walked
towards
the
park
nor
could
he
tell
whether
the
slight
nausea
he
experienced
was
due
to
afternoon
champagne
or
to
the
ceremony
that
had
gone
so
well
what
up
with
you
asked
dennant
you
look
as
glum
as
any
nothing
said
shelton
i
was
only
thinking
what
humbugs
we
all
are
bill
dennant
stopped
in
the
middle
of
the
crossing
and
clapped
his
future
upon
the
shoulder
oh
said
he
if
you
going
to
talk
shop
i
chapter
ix
the
dinner
the
dinner
at
the
casserols
was
given
to
those
of
the
bride
friends
who
had
been
conspicuous
in
the
day
festivities
shelton
found
himself
between
miss
casserol
and
a
lady
undressed
to
much
the
same
degree
opposite
sat
a
man
with
a
single
diamond
stud
a
white
waistcoat
black
moustache
and
face
this
was
in
fact
one
of
those
interesting
houses
occupied
by
people
of
the
upper
middle
class
who
have
imbibed
a
taste
for
smart
society
its
inhabitants
by
nature
acquisitive
and
cautious
economical
tenacious
had
learnt
to
worship
the
word
the
result
was
a
kind
of
heavy
froth
an
air
of
thoroughly
domestic
vice
in
addition
to
the
conventionally
fast
shelton
had
met
there
one
or
two
ladies
who
having
been
divorced
or
having
yet
to
be
still
maintained
their
position
in
divorced
ladies
who
did
not
so
maintain
their
place
were
never
to
be
found
for
the
casserols
had
a
great
respect
for
marriage
he
had
also
met
there
american
ladies
who
were
too
amusing
never
of
course
american
men
mesopotamians
of
the
financial
or
the
racing
type
and
several
of
those
gentlemen
who
had
been
or
were
about
to
be
engaged
in
a
transaction
which
might
or
again
might
not
come
off
and
in
conduct
of
an
order
which
might
or
again
might
not
be
spotted
the
line
he
knew
was
always
drawn
at
those
in
any
category
who
were
actually
found
out
for
the
value
of
these
ladies
and
these
gentlemen
was
not
their
claim
to
pity
nothing
so
sentimental
but
their
smartness
clothes
jokes
racing
tips
their
bridge
parties
and
their
motors
in
sum
the
house
was
one
whose
fundamental
domesticity
attracted
and
sheltered
those
who
were
too
smart
to
keep
their
heads
for
long
above
the
water
his
host
a
grey
city
man
with
a
long
upper
lip
was
trying
to
understand
a
lady
the
audacity
of
whose
speech
came
ringing
down
the
table
shelton
himself
had
given
up
the
effort
with
his
neighbours
and
made
love
to
his
dinner
which
surviving
the
incoherence
of
the
atmosphere
emerged
as
a
work
of
art
it
was
with
surprise
that
he
found
miss
casserol
addressing
him
i
always
say
that
the
great
thing
is
to
be
jolly
if
you
ca
find
anything
to
make
you
laugh
pretend
you
do
it
so
much
to
be
amusin
now
do
you
agree
the
philosophy
seemed
excellent
we
ca
all
be
geniuses
but
we
can
all
look
shelton
hastened
to
look
jolly
i
tell
the
governor
when
he
glum
that
i
shall
put
up
the
shutters
and
leave
him
what
the
good
of
mopin
and
lookin
miserable
are
you
going
to
the
meet
we
making
a
party
such
fun
all
the
smart
people
the
splendour
of
her
shoulders
her
frizzy
hair
clearly
not
two
hours
out
of
the
barber
hands
might
have
made
him
doubtful
but
the
frank
shrewdness
in
her
eyes
and
her
carefully
clipped
tone
of
voice
were
guarantees
that
she
was
part
of
the
element
at
the
table
which
was
really
quite
respectable
he
had
never
realised
before
how
smart
she
was
and
with
an
effort
abandoned
himself
to
a
sort
of
gaiety
that
would
have
killed
a
frenchman
and
when
she
left
him
he
reflected
upon
the
expression
of
her
eyes
when
they
rested
on
a
lady
opposite
who
was
a
true
what
is
it
their
envious
inquisitive
glance
had
seemed
to
say
that
makes
you
so
really
and
while
still
seeking
for
the
reason
he
noticed
his
host
pointing
out
the
merits
of
his
port
to
the
man
with
a
deferential
air
quite
pitiful
to
see
for
the
man
was
clearly
a
bad
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
did
these
staid
bourgeois
mean
by
making
up
to
vice
was
it
a
craving
to
be
thought
distinguished
a
dread
of
being
dull
or
merely
an
effect
of
overfeeding
again
he
looked
at
his
host
who
had
not
yet
enumerated
all
the
virtues
of
his
port
and
again
felt
sorry
for
him
so

going
to
marry
antonia
dennant
said
a
voice
on
his
right
with
that
easy
coarseness
which
is
a
mark
of
caste
pretty
girl
they
a
nice
place
the
dennants
d
ye
know
you
a
lucky

the
speaker
was
an
old
baronet
with
small
eyes
a
dusky
ruddy
face
and
peculiar
expression
at
once
morose
and
sly
he
was
always
hard
up
but
being
a
man
of
enterprise
knew
all
the
best
people
as
well
as
all
the
worst
so
that
he
dined
out
every
night
you
a
lucky
feller
he
repeated
he
got
some
deuced
good
shootin
dennant
they
come
too
high
for
me
though
never
touched
a
feather
last
time
i
shot
there
she
a
pretty
girl
you
a
lucky
feller
i
know
that
said
shelton
humbly
wish
i
were
in
your
shoes
who
was
that
sittin
on
the
other
side
of
you
i
so
dashed
carruther
oh
ay
an
expression
which
if
he
had
not
been
a
baronet
would
have
been
a
leer
came
on
his
lips
shelton
felt
that
he
was
referring
to
the
leaf
in
his
mental
covered
with
the
anecdotes
figures
and
facts
about
that
lady
the
old
ogre
means
thought
he
that
i
lucky
because
his
leaf
is
blank
about
but
the
old
baronet
had
turned
with
his
smile
and
his
sardonic
air
to
listen
to
a
bit
of
scandal
on
the
other
side
the
two
men
to
shelton
left
were
talking
what
you
do
collect
anything
how
that
everybody
collects
something
i
should
be
lost
without
my
no
i
do
collect
anything
given
it
up
i
was
too
awfully
had
over
my
shelton
had
expected
a
more
lofty
reason
he
applied
himself
to
the
madeira
in
his
glass
that
had
been
collected
by
his
host
and
its
price
was
going
up
you
could
get
it
every
day
worth
two
guineas
a
bottle
how
precious
the
idea
that
other
people
could
get
it
made
it
seem
liquid
delight
the
price
was
going
up
soon
there
would
be
none
left
immense
absolutely
no
one
then
could
drink
it
wish
i
had
some
of
this
said
the
old
baronet
but
i
have
drunk
all
poor
old
chap
thought
shelton
after
all
he
not
a
bad
old
boy
i
wish
i
had
his
pluck
his
liver
must
be
the
was
full
of
people
playing
a
game
concerned
with
horses
ridden
by
jockeys
with
the
latest
seat
and
shelton
was
compelled
to
help
in
carrying
on
this
sport
till
early
in
the
morning
at
last
he
left
exhausted
by
his
animation
he
thought
of
the
wedding
he
thought
over
his
dinner
and
the
wine
that
he
had
drunk
his
mood
of
satisfaction
fizzled
out
these
people
were
incapable
of
being
real
even
the
smartest
even
the
most
respectable
they
seemed
to
weigh
their
pleasures
in
the
scales
and
to
get
the
most
that
could
be
gotten
for
their
money
between
the
dark
safe
houses
stretching
for
miles
and
miles
his
thoughts
were
of
antonia
and
as
he
reached
his
rooms
he
was
overtaken
by
the
moment
when
the
town
is
born
again
the
first
new
air
had
stolen
down
the
sky
was
living
but
not
yet
alight
the
trees
were
quivering
faintly
no
living
creature
stirred
and
nothing
spoke
except
his
heart
suddenly
the
city
seemed
to
breathe
and
shelton
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
an
unconsidered
trifle
with
inferior
boots
was
asleep
upon
his
doorstep
chapter
x
an
alien
the
individual
on
the
doorstep
had
fallen
into
slumber
over
his
own
knees
no
greater
air
of
prosperity
clung
about
him
than
is
conveyed
by
a
rusty
overcoat
and
wisps
of
cloth
in
place
of
socks
shelton
endeavoured
to
pass
unseen
but
the
sleeper
woke
ah
it
you
monsieur
he
said
i
received
your
letter
this
evening
and
have
lost
no
he
looked
down
at
himself
and
tittered
as
though
to
say
but
what
a
state
i
in
the
young
foreigner
condition
was
indeed
more
desperate
than
on
the
occasion
of
their
first
meeting
and
shelton
invited
him
upstairs
you
can
well
understand
stammered
ferrand
following
his
host
that
i
did
want
to
miss
you
this
time
when
one
is
like
this
and
a
spasm
gripped
his
face
i
very
glad
you
came
said
shelton
doubtfully
his
visitor
face
had
a
week
growth
of
reddish
beard
the
deep
tan
of
his
cheeks
gave
him
a
robust
appearance
at
variance
with
the
fit
of
trembling
which
had
seized
on
him
as
soon
as
he
had
entered
sit
down
said
shelton
you
feeling
ill
ferrand
smiled
it
nothing
said
he
bad
shelton
left
him
seated
on
the
edge
of
an
armchair
and
brought
him
in
some
whisky
clothes
said
ferrand
when
he
had
drunk
are
what
i
want
these
are
really
not
good
the
statement
was
correct
and
shelton
placing
some
garments
in
the
invited
his
visitor
to
make
himself
at
home
while
the
latter
then
was
doing
this
shelton
enjoyed
the
luxuries
of
hunting
up
things
he
did
not
want
and
laying
them
in
two
portmanteaus
this
done
he
waited
for
his
visitor
return
the
young
foreigner
at
length
emerged
unshaved
indeed
and
innocent
of
boots
but
having
in
other
respects
an
air
of
gratifying
affluence
this
is
a
little
different
he
said
the
boots
i
fear
and
pulling
down
his
or
rather
shelton
socks
he
exhibited
sores
the
size
of
half
a
crown
one
does
sow
without
reaping
some
harvest
or
another
my
stomach
has
shrunk
he
added
simply
to
see
things
one
must
suffer
plus
fort
que
shelton
failed
to
perceive
that
this
was
one
way
of
disguising
the
human
animal
natural
dislike
of
work
there
was
a
touch
of
pathos
a
suggestion
of
about
this
fellow
i
have
eaten
my
illusions
said
the
young
foreigner
smoking
a
cigarette
when
you
starved
a
few
times
your
eyes
are
opened
mon
metier
mais
remarquez
ceci
monsieur
it
not
always
the
intellectuals
who
when
you
get
a
job
said
shelton
you
throw
it
away
i
you
accuse
me
of
restlessness
shall
i
explain
what
i
think
about
that
i
restless
because
of
ambition
i
want
to
reconquer
an
independent
position
i
put
all
my
soul
into
my
trials
but
as
soon
as
i
see
no
future
for
me
in
that
line
i
give
it
up
and
go
elsewhere
ne
veux
pas
etre
rond
de
cuir
breaking
my
back
to
economise
sixpence
a
day
and
save
enough
after
forty
years
to
drag
out
the
remains
of
an
exhausted
existence
that
not
in
my
this
ingenious
paraphrase
of
the
words
i
soon
get
tired
of
things
he
pronounced
with
an
air
of
letting
shelton
into
a
precious
secret
yes
it
must
be
hard
agreed
the
latter
ferrand
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
not
all
butter
he
replied
one
is
obliged
to
do
things
that
are
not
too
delicate
there
nothing
i
pride
myself
on
but
like
a
good
chemist
however
he
administered
what
shelton
could
stand
in
a
judicious
way
yes
yes
he
seemed
to
say
you
like
me
to
think
that
you
have
a
perfect
knowledge
of
life
no
morality
no
prejudices
no
illusions
you
like
me
to
think
that
you
feel
yourself
on
an
equality
with
me
one
human
animal
talking
to
another
without
any
barriers
of
position
money
clothes
or
the
rest
un
peu
trop
fort
you
as
good
an
imitation
as
i
come
across
in
your
class
notwithstanding
your
unfortunate
education
and
i
grateful
to
you
but
to
tell
you
everything
as
it
passes
through
my
mind
would
damage
my
prospects
you
can
hardly
expect
in
one
of
shelton
old
he
was
impressive
with
his
air
of
natural
almost
sensitive
refinement
the
room
looked
as
if
it
were
accustomed
to
him
and
more
amazing
still
was
the
sense
of
familiarity
that
he
inspired
as
though
he
were
a
part
of
shelton
soul
it
came
as
a
shock
to
realise
that
this
young
foreign
vagabond
had
taken
such
a
place
within
his
thoughts
the
pose
of
his
limbs
and
head
irregular
but
not
ungraceful
his
disillusioned
lips
the
rings
of
smoke
that
issued
from
them
all
signified
rebellion
and
the
overthrow
of
law
and
order
his
thin
lopsided
nose
the
rapid
glances
of
his
goggling
prominent
eyes
were
subtlety
itself
he
stood
for
discontent
with
the
accepted
how
do
i
live
when
i
am
on
the
tramp
he
said
well
there
are
the
consuls
the
system
is
not
delicate
but
when
it
a
question
of
starving
much
is
permissible
besides
these
gentlemen
were
created
for
the
purpose
there
a
coterie
of
german
jews
in
paris
living
entirely
upon
he
hesitated
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
and
resumed
yes
monsieur
if
you
have
papers
that
fit
you
you
can
try
six
or
seven
consuls
in
a
single
town
you
must
know
a
language
or
two
but
most
of
these
gentlemen
are
not
too
well
up
in
the
tongues
of
the
country
they
represent
obtaining
money
under
false
pretences
well
it
is
but
what
the
difference
at
bottom
between
all
this
honourable
crowd
of
directors
fashionable
physicians
employers
of
labour
military
men
country
priests
and
consuls
themselves
perhaps
who
take
money
and
give
no
value
for
it
and
poor
devils
who
do
the
same
at
far
greater
risk
necessity
makes
the
law
if
those
gentlemen
were
in
my
position
do
you
think
that
they
would
hesitate
shelton
face
remaining
doubtful
ferrand
went
on
instantly
right
they
would
from
fear
not
principle
one
must
be
hard
pressed
before
committing
these
indelicacies
look
deep
enough
and
you
will
see
what
indelicate
things
are
daily
done
by
the
respectable
for
not
half
so
good
a
reason
as
the
want
of
shelton
also
took
a
cigarette
his
own
income
was
derived
from
property
for
which
he
gave
no
value
in
labour
i
can
give
you
an
instance
said
ferrand
of
what
can
be
done
by
resolution
one
day
in
a
german
town
dans
la
misere
i
decided
to
try
the
french
consul
well
as
you
know
i
am
a
fleming
but
something
had
to
be
screwed
out
somewhere
he
refused
to
see
me
i
sat
down
to
wait
after
about
two
hours
a
voice
bellowed
the
brute
gone
and
my
consul
appears
nothing
for
fellows
like
you
says
he
out
i
answered
am
skin
and
bone
i
really
must
have
assistance
out
he
says
the
police
shall
throw
you
out
i
do
budge
another
hour
passes
and
back
he
comes
again
here
says
he
a
sergeant
the
sergeant
comes
says
the
consul
this
creature
out
i
say
house
is
france
naturally
i
had
calculated
upon
that
in
germany
they
not
too
fond
of
those
who
undertake
the
business
of
the
french
is
right
says
the
sergeant
can
do
nothing
refuse
and
he
went
away
do
you
think
you
get
by
staying
says
my
consul
have
nothing
to
eat
or
drink
and
nowhere
to
sleep
says
i
will
you
go
for
marks
then
get
out
i
can
tell
you
monsieur
one
must
have
a
thin
skin
if
one
wants
to
exploit
his
yellow
fingers
slowly
rolled
the
stump
of
his
cigarette
his
ironical
lips
flickered
shelton
thought
of
his
own
ignorance
of
life
he
could
not
recollect
ever
having
gone
without
a
meal
i
suppose
he
said
feebly
you
often
for
having
always
been
so
well
fed
the
idea
of
starvation
was
attractive
ferrand
smiled
four
days
is
the
longest
said
he
you
wo
believe
that
story
it
was
in
paris
and
i
had
lost
my
money
on
the
there
was
some
due
from
home
which
did
come
four
days
and
nights
i
lived
on
water
my
clothes
were
excellent
and
i
had
jewellery
but
i
never
even
thought
of
pawning
them
i
suffered
most
from
the
notion
that
people
might
guess
my
state
you
do
recognise
me
now
how
old
were
you
then
said
shelton
seventeen
it
curious
what
one
like
at
that
by
a
flash
of
insight
shelton
saw
the
boy
with
sensitive
smooth
face
always
on
the
move
about
the
streets
of
paris
for
fear
that
people
should
observe
the
condition
of
his
stomach
the
story
was
a
valuable
commentary
his
thoughts
were
brusquely
interrupted
looking
in
ferrand
face
he
saw
to
his
dismay
tears
rolling
down
his
cheeks
i
suffered
too
much
he
stammered
what
do
i
care
now
what
becomes
of
me
shelton
was
disconcerted
he
wished
say
something
sympathetic
but
being
an
englishman
could
only
turn
away
his
eyes
your
turn
coming
he
said
at
last
ah
when
you
lived
my
life
broke
out
his
visitor
nothing
any
good
my
heart
in
rags
find
me
anything
worth
keeping
in
this
moved
though
he
was
shelton
wriggled
in
his
chair
a
prey
to
racial
instinct
to
an
ingrained
perhaps
of
soul
that
forbade
him
from
exposing
his
emotions
and
recoiled
from
the
revelation
of
other
people
he
could
stand
it
on
the
stage
he
could
stand
it
in
a
book
but
in
real
life
he
could
not
stand
it
when
ferrand
had
gone
off
with
a
portmanteau
in
each
hand
he
sat
down
and
told
antonia
the
poor
chap
broke
down
and
sat
crying
like
a
child
and
instead
of
making
me
feel
sorry
it
turned
me
into
stone
the
more
sympathetic
i
wanted
to
be
the
gruffer
i
grew
is
it
fear
of
ridicule
independence
or
consideration
for
others
that
prevents
one
from
showing
feelings
he
went
on
to
tell
her
of
ferrand
starving
four
days
sooner
than
face
a
pawnbroker
and
reading
the
letter
over
before
addressing
it
the
faces
of
the
three
ladies
round
their
snowy
cloth
arose
before
him
antonia
face
so
fair
and
calm
and
her
mother
face
a
little
creased
by
time
and
weather
the
maiden
aunt
somewhat
too
they
seemed
to
lean
at
him
alert
and
decorous
and
the
words
that
rather
nice
rang
in
his
ears
he
went
out
to
post
the
letter
and
buying
a
order
enclosed
it
to
the
little
barber
carolan
as
a
reward
for
delivering
his
note
to
ferrand
he
omitted
to
send
his
address
with
this
donation
but
whether
from
delicacy
or
from
caution
he
could
not
have
said
beyond
doubt
however
on
receiving
through
ferrand
the
following
reply
he
felt
ashamed
and
pleased
blank
row
westminster
from
every
soul
humanity
is
owing
a
thousand
thanks
i
received
this
morning
your
postal
order
your
heart
henceforth
for
me
will
be
placed
beyond
all
praise
carolan
chapter
xi
the
vision
a
few
days
later
he
received
a
letter
from
antonia
which
filled
him
with
excitement
aunt
charlotte
is
ever
so
much
better
so
mother
thinks
we
can
go
but
she
says
that
you
and
i
must
keep
to
our
arrangement
not
to
see
each
other
till
july
there
will
be
something
fine
in
being
so
near
and
having
the
strength
to
keep
apart
all
the
english
are
gone
i
feel
it
so
empty
out
here
these
people
are
so
foreign
and
shallow
oh
dick
how
splendid
to
have
an
ideal
to
look
up
to
write
at
once
to
brewer
hotel
and
tell
me
you
think
the
same
we
arrive
at
charing
cross
on
sunday
at
seven
stay
at
brewer
for
a
couple
of
nights
and
go
down
on
tuesday
to
holm
oaks
always
your
antonia
he
thought
she
coming
tomorrow
and
leaving
his
neglected
breakfast
he
started
out
to
walk
off
his
emotion
his
square
ran
into
one
of
those
slums
that
still
rub
shoulders
with
the
most
distinguished
situations
and
in
it
he
came
upon
a
little
crowd
assembled
round
a
dogfight
one
of
the
dogs
was
being
mauled
but
the
day
was
muddy
and
shelton
like
any
englishman
had
a
horror
of
making
himself
conspicuous
even
in
a
decent
cause
he
looked
for
a
policeman
one
was
standing
by
to
see
fair
play
and
shelton
made
appeal
to
him
the
official
suggested
that
he
should
not
have
brought
out
a
fighting
dog
and
advised
him
to
throw
cold
water
over
them
it
is
n
my
dog
said
shelton
then
i
should
let
be
remarked
the
policeman
with
evident
surprise
shelton
appealed
indefinitely
to
the
lower
orders
the
lower
orders
however
were
afraid
of
being
bitten
i
would
meddle
with
that
there
job
if
i
was
you
said
one
nasty
breed
o
dawg
is
he
was
therefore
obliged
to
cast
away
respectability
spoil
his
trousers
and
his
gloves
break
his
umbrella
drop
his
hat
in
the
mud
and
separate
the
dogs
at
the
conclusion
of
the
job
the
lower
orders
said
to
him
in
a
rather
shamefaced
spanner
well
i
never
thought
you
have
managed
that
sir
but
like
all
men
of
inaction
shelton
after
action
was
more
dangerous
d
n
it
he
said
one
ca
let
a
dog
be
killed
and
he
marched
off
towing
the
injured
dog
with
his
and
looking
scornfully
at
harmless
having
satisfied
for
once
the
smouldering
fires
within
him
he
felt
entitled
to
hold
a
low
opinion
of
these
men
in
the
street
the
brutes
he
thought
wo
stir
a
finger
to
save
a
poor
dumb
creature
and
as
for
policemen
but
growing
cooler
he
began
to
see
that
people
weighted
down
by
honest
toil
could
not
afford
to
tear
their
trousers
or
get
a
bitten
hand
and
that
even
the
policeman
though
he
had
looked
so
like
a
was
absolutely
made
of
flesh
and
blood
he
took
the
dog
home
and
sending
for
a
had
him
sewn
up
he
was
already
tortured
by
the
doubt
whether
or
no
he
might
venture
to
meet
antonia
at
the
station
and
after
sending
his
servant
with
the
dog
to
the
address
marked
on
its
collar
he
formed
the
resolve
to
go
and
see
his
mother
with
some
vague
notion
that
she
might
help
him
to
decide
she
lived
in
kensington
and
crossing
the
brompton
road
he
was
soon
amongst
that
maze
of
houses
into
the
fibre
of
whose
structure
architects
have
wrought
the
motto
keep
what
you
have
wives
money
a
good
address
and
all
the
blessings
of
a
moral
state
shelton
pondered
as
he
passed
house
after
house
of
such
intense
respectability
that
even
dogs
were
known
to
bark
at
them
his
blood
was
still
too
hot
it
is
amazing
what
incidents
will
promote
the
loftiest
philosophy
he
had
been
reading
in
his
favourite
review
an
article
eulogising
the
freedom
and
expansion
which
had
made
the
upper
middle
class
so
fine
a
body
and
with
eyes
wandering
from
side
to
side
he
nodded
his
head
ironically
expansion
and
freedom
ran
his
thoughts
freedom
and
expansion
each
was
cold
and
formal
the
shell
of
an
owner
with
from
three
to
five
thousand
pounds
a
year
and
each
one
was
armoured
against
the
opinion
of
its
neighbours
by
a
sort
of
daring
regularity
conscious
of
my
rectitude
and
by
the
strict
observance
of
exactly
what
is
necessary
and
no
more
i
am
enabled
to
hold
my
head
up
in
the
world
the
person
who
lives
in
me
has
only
four
thousand
two
hundred
and
pounds
each
year
after
allowing
for
the
income
such
seemed
the
legend
of
these
houses
shelton
passed
ladies
in
ones
and
twos
and
threes
going
out
shopping
or
to
classes
of
drawing
cooking
ambulance
hardly
any
men
were
seen
and
they
were
mostly
policemen
but
a
few
disillusioned
children
were
being
wheeled
towards
the
park
by
nurses
accompanied
by
a
great
army
of
hairy
or
of
hairless
dogs
there
was
something
of
her
brother
large
liberality
about
shelton
a
tiny
lady
with
affectionate
eyes
warm
cheeks
and
chilly
feet
fond
as
a
cat
of
a
chair
by
the
fire
and
full
of
the
sympathy
that
has
no
insight
she
kissed
her
son
at
once
with
rapture
and
as
usual
began
to
talk
of
his
engagement
for
the
first
time
a
tremor
of
doubt
ran
through
her
son
his
mother
view
of
it
grated
on
him
like
the
sight
of
a
dress
it
was
too
rosy
her
splendid
optimism
damped
him
it
had
too
little
traffic
with
the
reasoning
powers
what
right
he
asked
himself
has
she
to
be
so
certain
it
seems
to
me
a
kind
of
the
dear
she
cooed
and
she
is
coming
back
hurrah
how
i
long
to
see
her
but
you
know
mother
we
agreed
not
to
meet
again
until
shelton
rocked
her
foot
and
holding
her
head
on
one
side
like
a
little
bird
looked
at
her
son
with
shining
eyes
dear
old
dick
she
said
how
happy
you
must
be
half
a
century
of
sympathy
with
weddings
of
all
sorts
good
bad
indifferent
beamed
from
her
i
suppose
said
shelton
gloomily
i
ought
not
to
go
and
see
her
at
the
cheer
up
replied
the
mother
and
her
son
felt
dreadfully
depressed
that
the
panacea
which
had
carried
her
blind
and
bright
through
every
evil
was
as
void
of
meaning
to
him
as
wine
without
a
flavour
and
how
is
your
sciatica
he
asked
oh
pretty
bad
returned
his
mother
i
expect
it
all
right
really
cheer
up
she
stretched
her
little
figure
canting
her
head
still
more
wonderful
woman
shelton
thought
she
had
in
fact
like
many
of
her
mislaid
the
darker
side
of
things
and
enjoying
the
benefits
of
orthodoxy
with
an
easy
conscience
had
kept
as
young
in
heart
as
any
girl
of
thirty
shelton
left
her
house
as
doubtful
whether
he
might
meet
antonia
as
when
he
entered
it
he
spent
a
restless
afternoon
the
next
day
that
of
her
arrival
was
a
sunday
he
had
made
ferrand
a
promise
to
go
with
him
to
hear
a
sermon
in
the
slums
and
catching
at
any
diversion
which
might
allay
excitement
he
fulfilled
it
the
preacher
in
question
an
amateur
so
ferrand
told
him
had
an
original
method
of
distributing
the
funds
that
he
obtained
to
male
sheep
he
gave
nothing
to
ugly
female
sheep
a
very
little
to
pretty
female
sheep
the
rest
ferrand
hazarded
an
inference
but
he
was
a
foreigner
the
englishman
preferred
to
look
upon
the
preacher
as
guided
by
a
purely
abstract
love
of
beauty
his
eloquence
at
any
rate
was
unquestionable
and
shelton
came
out
feeling
sick
it
was
not
yet
seven
so
entering
an
italian
restaurant
to
kill
the
before
antonia
arrival
he
ordered
a
bottle
of
wine
for
his
companion
a
cup
of
coffee
for
himself
and
lighting
a
cigarette
compressed
his
lips
there
was
a
strange
sweet
sinking
in
his
heart
his
companion
ignorant
of
this
emotion
drank
his
wine
crumbled
his
roll
and
blew
smoke
through
his
nostrils
glancing
caustically
at
the
rows
of
little
tables
the
cheap
mirrors
the
hot
red
velvet
the
chandeliers
his
juicy
lips
seemed
to
be
murmuring
ah
if
you
only
knew
of
the
dirt
behind
these
feathers
shelton
watched
him
with
disgust
though
his
clothes
were
now
so
nice
his
nails
were
not
quite
clean
and
his
fingertips
seemed
yellow
to
the
bone
an
anaemic
waiter
in
a
shirt
some
four
days
old
with
on
his
garments
and
a
crumpled
napkin
on
his
arm
stood
leaning
an
elbow
amongst
doubtful
fruits
and
reading
an
italian
journal
resting
his
tired
feet
in
turn
he
looked
like
overwork
personified
and
when
he
moved
each
limb
accused
the
sordid
smartness
of
the
walls
in
the
far
corner
sat
a
lady
eating
and
mirrored
opposite
her
feathered
hat
her
short
round
face
its
coat
of
powder
and
dark
eyes
gave
shelton
a
shiver
of
disgust
his
companion
gaze
rested
long
and
subtly
on
her
excuse
me
monsieur
he
said
at
length
i
think
i
know
that
lady
and
leaving
his
host
he
crossed
the
room
bowed
accosted
her
and
sat
down
with
pharisaic
delicacy
shelton
refrained
from
looking
but
presently
ferrand
came
back
the
lady
rose
and
left
the
restaurant
she
had
been
crying
the
young
foreigner
was
flushed
his
face
contorted
he
did
not
touch
his
wine
i
was
right
he
said
she
is
the
wife
of
an
old
friend
i
used
to
know
her
he
was
suffering
from
emotion
but
someone
less
absorbed
than
shelton
might
have
noticed
a
kind
of
relish
in
his
voice
as
though
he
were
savouring
life
dishes
and
glad
to
have
something
new
and
spiced
with
tragic
sauce
to
set
before
his
patron
you
can
find
her
story
by
the
hundred
in
your
streets
but
nothing
hinders
these
paragons
of
virtue
he
nodded
at
the
stream
of
carriages
from
turning
up
their
eyes
when
they
see
ladies
of
her
sort
pass
she
came
to
london
just
three
years
ago
after
a
year
one
of
her
little
boys
took
fever
the
shop
was
avoided
her
husband
caught
it
and
died
there
she
was
left
with
two
children
and
everything
gone
to
pay
the
debts
she
tried
to
get
work
no
one
helped
her
there
was
no
money
to
pay
anyone
to
stay
with
the
children
all
the
work
she
could
get
in
the
house
was
not
enough
to
keep
them
alive
she
not
a
strong
woman
well
she
put
the
children
out
to
nurse
and
went
to
the
streets
the
first
week
was
frightful
but
now
she
used
to
it
one
gets
used
to
can
nothing
be
done
asked
shelton
startled
no
returned
his
companion
i
know
that
sort
if
they
once
take
to
it
all
over
they
get
used
to
luxury
one
does
part
with
luxury
after
tasting
destitution
she
tells
me
she
does
very
nicely
the
children
are
happy
she
able
to
pay
well
and
see
them
sometimes
she
was
a
girl
of
good
family
too
who
loved
her
husband
and
gave
up
much
for
him
what
would
you
have
three
quarters
of
your
virtuous
ladies
placed
in
her
position
would
do
the
same
if
they
had
the
necessary
it
was
evident
that
he
felt
the
shock
of
this
discovery
and
shelton
understood
that
personal
acquaintance
makes
a
difference
even
in
a
vagabond
this
is
her
beat
said
the
young
foreigner
as
they
passed
the
illuminated
crescent
where
nightly
the
shadows
of
hypocrites
and
women
fall
and
shelton
went
from
these
comments
on
christianity
to
the
station
of
charing
cross
there
as
he
stood
waiting
in
the
shadow
his
heart
was
in
his
mouth
and
it
struck
him
as
odd
that
he
should
have
come
to
this
meeting
fresh
from
a
vagabond
society
presently
amongst
the
stream
of
travellers
he
saw
antonia
she
was
close
to
her
mother
who
was
parleying
with
a
footman
behind
them
were
a
maid
carrying
a
bandbox
and
a
porter
with
the
antonia
figure
with
its
throat
settled
in
the
collar
of
her
cape
slender
tall
severe
looked
impatient
and
remote
amongst
the
bustle
her
eyes
shadowed
by
the
journey
glanced
eagerly
about
welcoming
all
she
saw
a
wisp
of
hair
was
loose
above
her
ear
her
cheeks
glowed
cold
and
rosy
she
caught
sight
of
shelton
and
bending
her
neck
stood
looking
at
him
a
brilliant
smile
parted
her
lips
and
shelton
trembled
here
was
the
embodiment
of
all
he
had
desired
for
weeks
he
could
not
tell
what
was
behind
that
smile
of
hers
passionate
aching
or
only
some
ideal
some
chaste
and
glacial
intangibility
it
seemed
to
be
shining
past
him
into
the
gloomy
station
there
was
no
trembling
and
uncertainty
no
rage
of
possession
in
that
brilliant
smile
it
had
the
gleam
of
fixedness
like
the
smiling
of
a
star
what
did
it
matter
she
was
there
beautiful
as
a
young
day
and
smiling
at
him
and
she
was
his
only
divided
from
him
by
a
space
of
time
he
took
a
step
her
eyes
fell
at
once
her
face
regained
aloofness
he
saw
her
encircled
by
mother
footman
maid
and
porter
take
her
seat
and
drive
away
it
was
over
she
had
seen
him
she
had
smiled
but
alongside
his
delight
lurked
another
feeling
and
by
a
bitter
freak
not
her
face
came
up
before
him
but
the
face
of
that
lady
in
the
restaurant
short
round
and
powdered
with
eyes
what
right
had
we
to
scorn
them
had
they
mothers
footmen
porters
maids
he
shivered
but
this
time
with
physical
disgust
the
powdered
face
with
eyes
had
vanished
the
fair
remote
figure
of
the
came
back
again
he
sat
long
over
dinner
drinking
dreaming
he
sat
long
after
smoking
dreaming
and
when
at
length
he
drove
away
wine
and
dreams
fumed
in
his
brain
the
dance
of
lamps
the
moon
the
rays
of
clean
wet
light
on
his
horse
harness
the
jingling
of
the
cab
bell
the
whirring
wheels
the
night
air
and
the
branches
it
was
all
so
good
he
threw
back
the
hansom
doors
to
feel
the
touch
of
the
warm
breeze
the
crowds
on
the
pavement
gave
him
strange
delight
they
were
like
shadows
in
some
great
illusion
happy
shadows
thronging
wheeling
round
the
single
figure
of
his
world
chapter
xii
rotten
row
with
a
headache
and
a
sense
of
restlessness
hopeful
and
unhappy
shelton
mounted
his
hack
next
morning
for
a
gallop
in
the
park
in
the
sky
was
mingled
all
the
languor
and
the
violence
of
the
spring
the
trees
and
flowers
wore
an
awakened
look
in
the
gleams
of
light
that
came
stealing
down
from
behind
the
purple
of
the
clouds
the
air
was
and
the
passers
by
seemed
to
wear
an
air
of
tranquil
carelessness
as
if
anxiety
were
paralysed
by
their
responsibility
of
the
firmament
thronged
by
riders
the
row
was
all
astir
near
to
hyde
park
corner
a
figure
by
the
rails
caught
shelton
eye
straight
and
thin
one
shoulder
humped
a
little
as
if
its
owner
were
reflecting
clothed
in
a
and
a
brown
felt
hat
pinched
up
in
lawless
fashion
this
figure
was
so
detached
from
its
surroundings
that
it
would
have
been
noticeable
anywhere
it
belonged
to
ferrand
obviously
waiting
till
it
was
time
to
breakfast
with
his
patron
shelton
found
pleasure
in
thus
observing
him
unseen
and
sat
quietly
on
his
horse
hidden
behind
a
tree
it
was
just
at
that
spot
where
riders
unable
to
get
further
are
for
ever
wheeling
their
horses
for
another
turn
and
there
ferrand
the
bird
of
passage
with
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
watched
them
cantering
trotting
wheeling
up
and
down
three
men
walking
along
the
rails
were
snatching
off
their
hats
before
a
horsewoman
at
exactly
the
same
angle
and
with
precisely
the
same
air
as
though
in
the
modish
performance
of
this
ancient
rite
they
were
satisfying
some
instinct
very
dear
to
them
shelton
noted
the
curl
of
ferrand
lip
as
he
watched
this
sight
many
thanks
gentlemen
it
seemed
to
say
in
that
charming
little
action
you
have
shown
me
all
your
what
a
singular
gift
the
fellow
had
of
divesting
things
and
people
of
their
garments
of
tearing
away
their
veil
of
shams
and
their
phylacteries
shelton
turned
and
cantered
on
his
thoughts
were
with
antonia
and
he
did
not
want
the
glamour
stripped
away
he
was
glancing
at
the
sky
that
every
moment
threatened
to
discharge
a
violent
shower
of
rain
when
suddenly
he
heard
his
name
called
from
behind
and
who
should
ride
up
to
him
on
either
side
but
bill
dennant
and
antonia
herself
they
had
been
galloping
and
she
was
flushed
flushed
as
when
she
stood
on
the
old
tower
at
hyeres
but
with
a
joyful
radiance
different
from
the
calm
and
conquering
radiance
of
that
other
moment
to
delight
they
fell
into
line
with
him
and
all
three
went
galloping
along
the
strip
between
the
trees
and
rails
the
look
she
gave
him
seemed
to
say
i
do
care
if
it
is
forbidden
but
she
did
not
speak
he
could
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
how
lovely
she
looked
with
the
resolute
curve
of
her
figure
the
glimpse
of
gold
under
her
hat
the
glorious
colour
in
her
cheeks
as
if
she
had
been
kissed
it
so
splendid
to
be
at
home
let
go
faster
faster
she
cried
out
take
a
pull
we
shall
get
run
in
grumbled
her
brother
with
a
chuckle
they
reined
in
round
the
bend
and
jogged
more
soberly
down
on
the
far
side
still
not
a
word
from
her
to
shelton
and
shelton
in
his
turn
spoke
only
to
bill
dennant
he
was
afraid
to
speak
to
her
for
he
knew
that
her
mind
was
dwelling
on
this
chance
forbidden
meeting
in
a
way
quite
different
from
his
own
approaching
hyde
park
corner
where
ferrand
was
still
standing
against
the
rails
shelton
who
had
forgotten
his
existence
suffered
a
shock
when
his
eyes
fell
suddenly
on
that
impassive
figure
he
was
about
to
raise
his
hand
when
he
saw
that
the
young
foreigner
noting
his
instinctive
feeling
had
at
once
adapted
himself
to
it
they
passed
again
without
a
greeting
unless
that
swift
inquisition
followed
by
unconsciousness
in
ferrand
eyes
could
so
be
called
but
the
feeling
of
idiotic
happiness
left
shelton
he
grew
irritated
at
this
silence
it
tantalised
him
more
and
more
for
bill
dennant
had
lagged
behind
to
chatter
to
a
friend
shelton
and
antonia
were
alone
walking
their
horses
without
a
word
not
even
looking
at
each
other
at
one
moment
he
thought
of
galloping
ahead
and
leaving
her
then
of
breaking
the
vow
of
muteness
she
seemed
to
be
imposing
on
him
and
he
kept
thinking
it
ought
to
be
either
one
thing
or
the
other
i
ca
stand
her
calmness
was
getting
on
his
nerves
she
seemed
to
have
determined
just
how
far
she
meant
to
go
to
have
fixed
a
limit
in
her
happy
young
beauty
and
radiant
coolness
she
summed
up
that
sane
consistent
something
existing
in
nine
out
of
ten
of
the
people
shelton
knew
i
ca
stand
it
long
he
thought
and
all
of
a
sudden
spoke
but
as
he
did
so
she
frowned
and
cantered
on
when
he
caught
her
she
was
smiling
lifting
her
face
to
catch
the
raindrops
which
were
falling
fast
she
gave
him
just
a
nod
and
waved
her
hand
as
a
sign
for
him
to
go
and
when
he
would
not
she
frowned
he
saw
bill
dennant
posting
after
them
and
seized
by
a
sense
of
the
ridiculous
lifted
his
hat
and
galloped
off
the
rain
was
coming
down
in
torrents
now
and
every
one
was
scurrying
for
shelter
he
looked
back
from
the
bend
and
could
still
make
out
antonia
riding
leisurely
her
face
upturned
and
revelling
in
the
shower
why
had
she
either
cut
him
altogether
or
taken
the
sweets
the
gods
had
sent
it
seemed
wicked
to
have
wasted
such
a
chance
and
ploughing
back
to
hyde
park
corner
he
turned
his
head
to
see
if
by
any
chance
she
had
relented
his
irritation
was
soon
gone
but
his
longing
stayed
was
ever
anything
so
beautiful
as
she
had
looked
with
her
face
turned
to
the
rain
she
seemed
to
love
the
rain
it
suited
her
suited
her
ever
so
much
better
than
the
sunshine
of
the
south
yes
she
was
very
english
puzzling
and
fretting
he
reached
his
rooms
ferrand
had
not
arrived
in
fact
did
not
turn
up
that
day
his
afforded
shelton
another
proof
of
the
delicacy
that
went
hand
in
hand
with
the
young
vagrant
cynicism
in
the
afternoon
he
received
a
note
you
see
dick
he
read
i
ought
to
have
cut
you
but
i
felt
too
crazy
everything
seems
so
jolly
at
home
even
this
stuffy
old
london
of
course
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
badly
there
are
heaps
of
things
one
ca
say
by
letter
but
i
should
have
been
sorry
afterwards
i
told
mother
she
said
i
was
quite
right
but
i
do
think
she
took
it
in
do
you
feel
that
the
only
thing
that
really
matters
is
to
have
an
ideal
and
to
keep
it
so
safe
that
you
can
always
look
forward
and
feel
that
you
have
been
i
ca
exactly
express
my
meaning
shelton
lit
a
cigarette
and
frowned
it
seemed
to
him
queer
that
she
should
set
more
store
by
an
ideal
than
by
the
fact
that
they
had
met
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
many
weeks
i
suppose
she
right
he
thought
i
suppose
she
right
i
ought
not
to
have
tried
to
speak
to
her
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
not
at
all
feel
that
she
was
right
chapter
xiii
an
at
home
on
tuesday
morning
he
wandered
off
to
paddington
hoping
for
a
chance
view
of
her
on
her
way
down
to
holm
oaks
but
the
sense
of
the
ridiculous
on
which
he
had
been
nurtured
was
strong
enough
to
keep
him
from
actually
entering
the
station
and
lurking
about
until
she
came
with
a
pang
of
disappointment
he
retraced
his
steps
from
praed
street
to
the
park
and
once
there
tried
no
further
to
waylay
her
he
paid
a
round
of
calls
in
the
afternoon
mostly
on
her
relations
and
seeking
out
aunt
charlotte
he
dolorously
related
his
encounter
in
the
row
but
she
found
it
rather
nice
and
on
his
pressing
her
with
his
views
she
murmured
that
it
was
quite
romantic
do
you
still
it
very
hard
said
shelton
and
he
went
away
disconsolate
as
he
was
dressing
for
dinner
his
eye
fell
on
a
card
announcing
the
at
home
of
one
of
his
own
cousins
her
husband
was
a
composer
and
he
had
a
vague
idea
that
he
would
find
at
the
house
of
a
composer
some
quite
unusually
free
kind
of
atmosphere
after
dining
at
the
club
therefore
he
set
out
for
chelsea
the
party
was
held
in
a
large
room
on
the
which
was
already
crowded
with
people
when
shelton
entered
they
stood
or
sat
about
in
groups
with
smiles
fixed
on
their
lips
and
the
light
from
lamps
fell
in
patches
on
their
heads
and
hands
and
shoulders
someone
had
just
finished
rendering
on
the
piano
a
composition
of
his
own
an
expert
could
at
once
have
picked
out
from
amongst
the
applauding
company
those
who
were
musicians
by
profession
for
their
eyes
sparkled
and
a
certain
acidity
pervaded
their
enthusiasm
this
freemasonry
of
professional
intolerance
flew
from
one
to
the
other
like
a
breath
of
unanimity
and
the
faint
shrugging
of
shoulders
was
as
harmonious
as
though
one
of
the
high
windows
had
been
opened
suddenly
admitting
a
draught
of
chill
may
air
shelton
made
his
way
up
to
his
cousin
a
fragile
woman
in
black
velvet
and
venetian
lace
whose
starry
eyes
beamed
at
him
until
her
duties
after
the
custom
of
these
social
gatherings
obliged
her
to
break
off
conversation
just
as
it
began
to
interest
him
he
was
passed
on
to
another
lady
who
was
already
talking
to
two
gentlemen
and
their
volubility
being
greater
than
his
own
he
fell
into
the
position
of
observer
instead
of
the
profound
questions
he
had
somehow
expected
to
hear
raised
everybody
seemed
gossiping
or
searching
the
heart
of
such
topics
as
where
to
go
this
summer
or
how
to
get
new
servants
trifling
with
they
dissected
their
fellow
artists
in
the
same
way
as
his
society
friends
of
the
other
night
had
dissected
the
fellow
smart
and
the
varnish
on
the
floor
the
pictures
and
the
piano
were
reflected
on
all
the
faces
around
shelton
moved
from
group
to
group
disconsolate
a
tall
imposing
person
stood
under
a
japanese
print
holding
the
palm
of
one
hand
outspread
his
unwieldy
trunk
and
thin
legs
wobbled
in
concert
to
his
ingratiating
voice
war
he
was
saying
is
not
necessary
war
is
not
necessary
i
hope
i
make
myself
clear
war
is
not
necessary
it
depends
on
nationality
but
nationality
is
not
he
inclined
his
head
to
one
side
why
do
we
have
nationality
let
us
do
away
with
boundaries
let
us
have
the
warfare
of
commerce
if
i
see
france
looking
at
brighton
he
laid
his
head
upon
one
side
and
beamed
at
shelton
what
do
i
do
do
i
say
off
no
it
i
say
take
it
he
archly
smiled
but
do
you
think
they
would
and
the
softness
of
his
contours
fascinated
shelton
the
soldier
the
person
underneath
the
print
resumed
is
necessarily
on
a
lower
plane
intellectually
oh
intellectually
than
the
philanthropist
his
sufferings
are
less
acute
he
enjoys
the
compensations
of
advertisement
you
admit
that
he
breathed
persuasively
for
instance
i
am
quite
impersonal
i
suffer
but
do
i
talk
about
it
but
someone
gazing
at
his
waistcoat
he
put
his
thesis
in
another
form
i
have
one
acre
and
one
cow
my
brother
has
one
acre
and
one
cow
do
i
seek
to
take
them
away
from
him
shelton
hazarded
perhaps
you
weaker
than
your
come
come
take
the
case
of
women
now
i
consider
our
marriage
laws
are
for
the
first
time
shelton
conceived
respect
for
them
he
made
a
comprehensive
gesture
and
edged
himself
into
the
conversation
of
another
group
for
fear
of
having
all
his
prejudices
overturned
here
an
irish
sculptor
standing
in
a
curve
was
saying
furiously
bees
are
not
bhumpkins
d
their
sowls
a
scotch
painter
who
listened
with
a
curly
smile
seemed
trying
to
compromise
this
proposition
which
appeared
to
have
relation
to
the
middle
classes
and
though
agreeing
with
the
irishman
shelton
felt
nervous
over
his
discharge
of
electricity
next
to
them
two
american
ladies
assembled
under
the
tent
of
hair
belonging
to
a
writer
of
songs
were
discussing
the
emotions
aroused
in
them
by
wagner
operas
they
produce
a
strange
condition
of
affairs
in
me
said
the
thinner
one
they
just
divine
said
the
fatter
i
do
know
if
you
can
call
the
fleshly
lusts
divine
replied
the
thinner
looking
into
the
eyes
of
the
writer
of
the
songs
amidst
all
the
hum
of
voices
and
the
fumes
of
smoke
a
sense
of
formality
was
haunting
shelton
sandwiched
between
a
dutchman
and
a
prussian
poet
he
could
understand
neither
of
his
neighbours
so
assuming
an
intelligent
expression
he
fell
to
thinking
that
an
assemblage
of
free
spirits
is
as
much
bound
by
the
convention
of
exchanging
their
ideas
as
commonplace
people
are
by
the
convention
of
having
no
ideas
to
traffic
in
he
could
not
help
wondering
whether
in
the
bulk
they
were
not
just
as
dependent
on
each
other
as
the
inhabitants
of
kensington
whether
like
locomotives
they
could
run
at
all
without
these
opportunities
for
blowing
off
the
steam
and
what
would
be
left
when
the
steam
had
all
escaped
somebody
ceased
playing
the
violin
and
close
to
him
a
group
began
discussing
ethics
aspirations
were
in
the
air
all
round
like
a
lot
of
hungry
ghosts
he
realised
that
if
tongue
be
given
to
them
the
flavour
vanishes
from
ideas
which
haunt
the
soul
again
the
violinist
played
cock
gracious
said
the
prussian
poet
falling
into
english
as
the
fiddle
ceased
colossal
wie
er
ist
have
you
read
that
thing
of
besom
asked
shrill
voice
behind
oh
my
dear
fellow
too
horrid
for
words
he
ought
to
be
hanged
the
man
dreadful
pursued
the
voice
shriller
than
ever
nothing
but
a
volcanic
eruption
would
cure
shelton
turned
in
alarm
to
look
at
the
authors
of
these
statements
they
were
two
men
of
letters
talking
of
a
third
un
grand
naif
vous
savez
said
the
second
speaker
these
fellows
do
exist
resumed
the
first
his
small
eyes
gleamed
with
a
green
light
his
whole
face
had
a
look
as
if
he
gnawed
himself
though
not
a
man
of
letters
shelton
could
not
help
recognising
from
those
eyes
what
joy
it
was
to
say
those
words
these
fellows
exist
poor
besom
you
know
what
moulter
said
shelton
turned
away
as
if
he
had
been
too
close
to
one
whose
hair
smelt
of
cantharides
and
looking
round
the
room
he
frowned
with
the
exception
of
his
cousin
he
seemed
the
only
person
there
of
english
blood
americans
mesopotamians
irish
italians
germans
scotch
and
russians
he
was
not
contemptuous
of
them
for
being
foreigners
it
was
simply
that
god
and
the
climate
had
made
him
different
by
a
skin
or
so
but
at
this
point
his
conclusions
were
denied
as
will
sometimes
happen
by
his
introduction
to
an
englishman
a
major
somebody
who
with
smooth
hair
and
blond
moustache
neat
eyes
and
neater
clothes
seemed
a
little
anxious
at
his
own
presence
there
shelton
took
a
liking
to
him
partly
from
a
and
partly
because
of
the
gentle
smile
with
which
he
was
looking
at
his
wife
almost
before
he
had
said
how
do
you
do
he
was
plunged
into
a
discussion
on
imperialism
admitting
all
that
said
shelton
what
i
hate
is
the
humbug
with
which
we
pride
ourselves
on
benefiting
the
whole
world
by
our
civilising
the
soldier
turned
his
reasonable
eyes
but
is
it
humbug
shelton
saw
his
argument
in
peril
if
we
really
thought
it
was
it
humbug
he
replied
however
why
should
we
a
small
portion
of
the
world
population
assume
that
our
standards
are
the
proper
ones
for
every
kind
of
race
if
it
not
humbug
it
sheer
the
soldier
without
taking
his
hands
out
of
his
pockets
but
by
a
forward
movement
of
his
face
showing
that
he
was
both
sincere
and
just
well
it
must
be
a
good
sort
of
stupidity
it
makes
us
the
nation
that
we
shelton
felt
dazed
the
conversation
buzzed
around
him
he
heard
the
smiling
prophet
saying
altruism
altruism
and
in
his
voice
a
something
seemed
to
murmur
oh
i
do
so
hope
i
make
a
good
impression
he
looked
at
the
soldier
head
with
its
eyes
the
tiny
at
their
corners
the
conventional
moustache
he
envied
the
certainty
of
the
convictions
lying
under
that
hair
i
would
rather
we
were
men
first
and
then
englishmen
he
muttered
i
think
it
all
a
sort
of
national
illusion
and
i
ca
stand
if
you
come
to
that
said
the
soldier
the
world
lives
by
illusions
i
mean
if
you
look
at
history
you
see
that
the
creation
of
illusions
has
always
been
her
business
do
you
this
shelton
was
unable
to
deny
so
continued
the
soldier
who
was
evidently
a
highly
cultivated
man
if
you
admit
that
movement
labour
progress
and
all
that
have
been
properly
given
to
building
up
these
illusions
that
er
in
fact
they
what
you
might
call
er
the
outcome
of
the
world
crescendo
he
rushed
his
voice
over
this
phrase
as
if
ashamed
of
it
why
do
you
want
to
destroy
them
shelton
thought
a
moment
then
squeezing
his
body
with
his
folded
arms
replied
the
past
has
made
us
what
we
are
of
course
and
can
not
be
destroyed
but
how
about
the
future
it
surely
time
to
let
in
air
cathedrals
are
very
fine
and
everybody
likes
the
smell
of
incense
but
when
they
been
for
centuries
without
ventilation
you
know
what
the
atmosphere
gets
the
soldier
smiled
by
your
own
admission
he
said
you
only
be
creating
a
fresh
set
of
yes
answered
shelton
but
at
all
events
they
be
the
honest
necessities
of
the
the
pupils
of
the
soldier
eyes
contracted
he
evidently
felt
the
conversation
slipping
into
generalities
he
answered
i
ca
see
how
thinking
small
beer
of
ourselves
is
going
to
do
us
any
good
an
at
home
shelton
felt
in
danger
of
being
thought
unpractical
in
giving
vent
to
the
remark
one
must
trust
one
reason
i
never
can
persuade
myself
that
i
believe
in
what
i
a
minute
later
with
a
cordial
handshake
the
soldier
left
and
shelton
watched
his
courteous
figure
shepherding
his
wife
away
dick
may
i
introduce
you
to
wilfrid
curly
said
his
voice
behind
and
he
found
his
hand
being
diffidently
shaken
by
a
youth
with
a
forehead
who
was
saying
nervously
how
do
you
do
yes
i
am
very
well
thank
you
he
now
remembered
that
when
he
had
first
come
in
he
had
watched
this
youth
who
had
been
standing
in
a
corner
indulging
himself
in
private
smiles
he
had
an
uncommon
look
as
though
he
were
in
love
with
life
as
though
he
regarded
it
as
a
creature
to
whom
one
could
put
questions
to
the
very
end
interesting
humorous
earnest
questions
he
looked
diffident
and
amiable
and
independent
and
he
too
was
evidently
english
are
you
good
at
argument
said
shelton
at
a
loss
for
a
remark
the
youth
smiled
blushed
and
putting
back
his
hair
replied
yes
no
i
do
know
i
think
my
brain
does
work
fast
enough
for
argument
you
know
how
many
motions
of
the
go
to
each
remark
it
awfully
interesting
and
bending
from
the
waist
in
a
mathematical
position
he
extended
the
palm
of
one
hand
and
started
to
explain
shelton
stared
at
the
youth
hand
at
his
frowns
and
the
taps
he
gave
his
forehead
while
he
found
the
expression
of
his
meaning
he
was
intensely
interested
the
youth
broke
off
looked
at
his
watch
and
blushing
brightly
said
i
afraid
i
have
to
go
i
have
to
be
at
the
before
i
must
be
off
too
said
shelton
making
their
adieux
together
they
sought
their
hats
and
coats
chapter
xiv
the
night
club
may
i
ask
said
shelton
as
he
and
the
youth
came
out
into
the
chilly
street
what
it
is
you
call
the
his
companion
smilingly
answered
oh
the
night
club
we
take
it
in
turns
thursday
is
my
night
would
you
like
to
come
you
see
a
lot
of
types
it
only
round
the
shelton
digested
a
momentary
doubt
and
answered
yes
they
reached
the
corner
house
in
an
angle
of
a
dismal
street
through
the
open
door
of
which
two
men
had
just
gone
in
following
they
ascended
some
wooden
stairs
and
entered
a
large
boarded
room
smelling
of
sawdust
gas
stale
coffee
and
old
clothes
it
was
furnished
with
a
bagatelle
board
two
or
three
wooden
tables
some
wooden
forms
and
a
wooden
bookcase
seated
on
these
wooden
chairs
or
standing
up
were
youths
and
older
men
of
the
working
class
who
seemed
to
shelton
to
be
peculiarly
dejected
one
was
reading
one
against
the
wall
was
drinking
coffee
with
a
disillusioned
air
two
were
playing
chess
and
a
group
of
four
made
a
ceaseless
clatter
with
the
bagatelle
a
little
man
in
a
dark
suit
with
a
pale
face
thin
lips
and
eyes
who
was
obviously
in
charge
came
up
with
an
anaemic
smile
you
rather
late
he
said
to
curly
and
looking
ascetically
at
shelton
asked
without
waiting
for
an
introduction
do
you
play
chess
there
young
smith
wants
a
a
youth
with
a
wooden
face
already
seated
before
a
asked
him
drearily
if
he
would
have
black
or
white
shelton
took
white
he
was
oppressed
by
the
virtuous
odour
of
this
room
the
little
man
with
the
deep
blue
eyes
came
up
stood
in
an
uneasy
attitude
and
watched
your
play
improving
young
smith
he
said
i
should
think
you
be
able
to
give
banks
a
his
eyes
rested
on
shelton
fanatical
and
dreary
his
monotonous
voice
was
suffering
and
nasal
he
was
continually
sucking
in
his
lips
as
though
determined
to
subdue
flesh
you
should
come
here
often
he
said
to
shelton
as
the
latter
received
checkmate
you
get
some
good
practice
we
several
very
fair
players
you
not
as
good
as
jones
or
bartholomew
he
added
to
shelton
opponent
as
though
he
felt
it
a
duty
to
put
the
latter
in
his
place
you
ought
to
come
here
often
he
repeated
to
shelton
we
have
a
lot
of
very
good
young
fellows
and
with
a
touch
of
complacence
he
glanced
around
the
dismal
room
there
are
not
so
many
here
tonight
as
usual
where
are
toombs
and
body
shelton
too
looked
anxiously
around
he
could
not
help
feeling
sympathy
with
toombs
and
body
they
getting
slack
i
afraid
said
the
little
man
our
principle
is
to
amuse
everyone
excuse
me
a
minute
i
see
that
carpenter
is
doing
he
crossed
over
to
the
man
who
had
been
drinking
coffee
but
shelton
had
barely
time
to
glance
at
his
opponent
and
try
to
think
of
a
remark
before
the
little
man
was
back
do
you
know
anything
about
astronomy
he
asked
of
shelton
we
have
several
very
interested
in
astronomy
if
you
could
talk
to
them
a
little
it
would
shelton
made
a
motion
of
alarm
said
he
i
i
wish
you
come
sometimes
on
wednesdays
we
have
most
interesting
talks
and
a
service
afterwards
we
always
anxious
to
get
new
blood
and
his
eyes
searched
shelton
brown
rather
face
as
though
trying
to
see
how
much
blood
there
was
in
it
young
curly
says
you
just
been
around
the
world
you
could
describe
your
may
i
ask
said
shelton
how
your
club
is
made
up
again
a
look
of
complacency
and
blessed
assuagement
visited
the
little
man
oh
he
said
we
take
anybody
unless
there
anything
against
them
the
day
society
sees
to
that
of
course
we
should
take
anyone
if
they
were
to
report
against
them
you
ought
to
come
to
our
committee
meetings
they
on
mondays
at
seven
the
women
side
too
thank
you
said
shelton
you
very
kind
we
should
be
pleased
said
the
little
man
and
his
face
seemed
to
suffer
more
than
ever
they
mostly
young
fellows
here
but
we
have
married
men
too
of
course
we
very
careful
about
that
he
added
hastily
as
though
he
might
have
injured
prejudices
that
and
drink
and
anything
criminal
you
and
do
you
give
pecuniary
assistance
too
oh
yes
replied
the
little
man
if
you
were
to
come
to
our
committee
meetings
you
would
see
for
yourself
everything
is
most
carefully
gone
into
we
endeavour
to
sift
the
wheat
from
the
i
suppose
said
shelton
you
find
a
great
deal
of
chaff
the
little
man
smiled
a
suffering
smile
the
twang
of
his
toneless
voice
sounded
a
trifle
shriller
i
was
obliged
to
refuse
a
man
a
man
and
a
woman
quite
young
people
with
three
small
children
he
was
ill
and
out
of
work
but
on
inquiry
we
found
that
they
were
not
man
and
there
was
a
slight
pause
the
little
man
eyes
were
fastened
on
his
nails
and
with
an
appearance
of
enjoyment
he
began
to
bite
them
shelton
face
had
grown
a
trifle
red
and
what
becomes
of
the
woman
and
the
children
in
a
case
like
that
he
said
the
little
man
eyes
began
to
smoulder
we
make
a
point
of
not
encouraging
sin
of
course
excuse
me
a
minute
i
see
they
finished
he
hurried
off
and
in
a
moment
the
clack
of
bagatelle
began
again
he
himself
was
playing
with
a
cold
and
spurious
energy
running
after
the
balls
and
exhorting
the
other
players
upon
whom
a
wooden
acquiescence
seemed
to
fall
shelton
crossed
the
room
and
went
up
to
young
curly
he
was
sitting
on
a
bench
smiling
to
himself
his
private
smiles
are
you
staying
here
much
longer
shelton
asked
young
curly
rose
with
nervous
haste
i
afraid
he
said
there
nobody
very
interesting
here
oh
not
at
all
said
shelton
on
the
contrary
only
i
had
a
rather
tiring
day
and
somehow
i
do
feel
up
to
the
standard
his
new
acquaintance
smiled
oh
really
do
you
think
that
is
but
he
had
not
time
to
finish
before
the
clack
of
bagatelle
balls
ceased
and
the
voice
of
the
little
man
was
heard
saying
anybody
who
wants
a
book
will
put
his
name
down
there
will
be
the
usual
on
wednesday
next
will
you
all
go
quietly
i
am
going
to
turn
the
lights
one
vanished
and
the
remaining
jet
flared
suddenly
by
its
harder
glare
the
wooden
room
looked
harder
too
and
disenchanting
the
figures
of
its
occupants
began
filing
through
the
door
the
little
man
was
left
in
the
centre
of
the
room
his
deep
eyes
smouldering
upon
the
backs
of
the
retreating
members
his
thumb
and
finger
raised
to
the
turncock
of
the
metre
do
you
know
this
part
asked
young
curly
as
they
emerged
into
the
street
it
really
jolly
one
of
the
darkest
bits
in
london
it
is
really
if
you
care
i
can
take
you
through
an
awfully
dangerous
place
where
the
police
never
he
seemed
so
anxious
for
the
honour
that
shelton
was
loath
to
disappoint
him
i
come
here
pretty
often
he
went
on
as
they
ascended
a
sort
of
alley
rambling
darkly
between
a
wall
and
row
of
houses
why
asked
shelton
it
does
smell
too
the
young
man
threw
up
his
nose
and
sniffed
as
if
eager
to
add
any
new
scent
that
might
be
about
to
his
knowledge
of
life
no
that
one
of
the
reasons
you
know
he
said
one
must
find
out
the
darkness
is
jolly
too
anything
might
happen
here
last
week
there
was
a
murder
there
always
the
chance
of
shelton
stared
but
the
charge
of
morbidness
would
not
lie
against
this
stripling
there
a
splendid
drain
just
here
his
guide
resumed
the
people
are
dying
like
flies
of
typhoid
in
those
three
houses
and
under
the
first
light
he
turned
his
grave
cherubic
face
to
indicate
the
houses
if
we
were
in
the
east
end
i
could
show
you
other
places
quite
as
good
there
a
keeper
in
one
that
knows
all
the
thieves
in
london
he
a
splendid
type
but
he
added
looking
a
little
anxiously
at
shelton
it
might
be
safe
for
you
with
me
different
they
beginning
to
know
me
i
nothing
to
take
you
i
afraid
it
ca
be
said
shelton
i
must
get
do
you
mind
if
i
walk
with
you
it
so
jolly
now
the
stars
are
delighted
said
shelton
do
you
often
go
to
that
club
his
companion
raised
his
hat
and
ran
his
fingers
through
his
hair
they
rather
too
for
me
he
said
i
like
to
go
where
you
can
see
people
eat
school
treats
or
somewhere
in
the
country
it
does
one
good
to
see
them
eat
they
do
get
enough
you
see
as
a
rule
to
make
bone
it
all
used
up
for
brain
and
muscle
there
are
some
places
in
the
winter
where
they
give
them
bread
and
cocoa
i
like
to
go
to
i
went
once
said
shelton
but
i
felt
ashamed
for
putting
my
nose
oh
they
do
mind
most
of
them
are
with
cold
you
know
you
see
splendid
types
lots
of
dipsomaniacs
it
useful
to
me
he
went
on
as
they
passed
a
to
walk
about
at
night
one
can
take
so
much
more
notice
i
had
a
jolly
night
last
week
in
hyde
park
a
chance
to
study
human
nature
and
do
you
find
it
interesting
asked
shelton
his
companion
smiled
awfully
he
replied
i
saw
a
fellow
pick
three
what
did
you
do
i
had
a
jolly
talk
with
shelton
thought
of
the
little
man
who
made
a
point
of
not
encouraging
sin
he
was
one
of
the
professionals
from
notting
hill
you
know
told
me
his
life
never
had
a
chance
of
course
the
most
interesting
part
was
telling
him
i
seen
him
pick
three
pockets
like
creeping
into
a
cave
when
you
ca
tell
what
well
he
showed
me
what
he
got
only
fivepence
and
what
became
of
your
friend
asked
shelton
oh
went
off
he
had
a
splendidly
low
they
had
reached
shelton
rooms
will
you
come
in
said
the
latter
and
have
a
drink
the
youth
smiled
blushed
and
shook
his
head
no
thank
you
he
said
i
have
to
walk
to
whitechapel
i
living
on
porridge
now
splendid
stuff
for
making
bone
i
generally
live
on
porridge
for
a
week
at
the
end
of
every
month
it
the
best
diet
if
you
hard
up
once
more
blushing
and
smiling
he
was
gone
shelton
went
upstairs
and
sat
down
on
his
bed
he
felt
a
little
miserable
sitting
there
slowly
pulling
out
the
ends
of
his
white
tie
disconsolate
he
had
a
vision
of
antonia
with
her
gaze
fixed
wonderingly
on
him
and
this
wonder
of
hers
came
as
a
revelation
just
as
that
morning
when
looking
from
his
window
he
had
seen
a
stop
suddenly
and
scratch
his
leg
and
it
had
come
upon
him
in
a
flash
that
that
man
had
thoughts
and
feelings
of
his
own
he
would
never
know
what
antonia
really
felt
and
thought
till
i
saw
her
at
the
station
i
did
know
how
much
i
loved
her
or
how
little
i
knew
her
and
sighing
deeply
he
hurried
into
bed
chapter
xv
pole
to
pole
the
waiting
in
london
for
july
to
come
was
daily
more
unbearable
to
shelton
and
if
it
had
not
been
for
ferrand
who
still
came
to
breakfast
he
would
have
deserted
the
metropolis
on
june
first
the
latter
presented
himself
rather
later
than
was
his
custom
and
announced
that
through
a
friend
he
had
heard
of
a
position
as
interpreter
to
an
hotel
at
folkestone
if
i
had
money
to
face
the
first
necessities
he
said
swiftly
turning
over
a
collection
of
smeared
papers
with
his
yellow
fingers
as
if
searching
for
his
own
identity
i
leave
today
this
london
blackens
my
are
you
certain
to
get
this
place
asked
shelton
i
think
so
the
young
foreigner
replied
i
got
some
good
enough
shelton
could
not
help
a
dubious
glance
at
the
papers
in
his
hand
a
hurt
look
passed
on
to
ferrand
curly
lips
beneath
his
nascent
red
moustache
you
mean
that
to
have
false
papers
is
as
bad
as
theft
no
no
i
shall
never
be
a
thief
i
had
too
many
opportunities
said
he
with
pride
and
bitterness
that
not
in
my
character
i
never
do
harm
to
anyone
this
he
touched
the
papers
is
not
delicate
but
it
does
harm
to
no
one
if
you
have
no
money
you
must
have
papers
they
stand
between
you
and
starvation
society
has
an
excellent
eye
for
the
helpless
it
never
treads
on
people
unless
they
really
he
looked
at
shelton
you
made
me
what
i
am
amongst
you
he
seemed
to
say
now
put
up
with
me
but
there
are
always
the
workhouses
shelton
remarked
at
last
workhouses
returned
ferrand
certainly
there
are
regular
palaces
i
will
tell
you
one
thing
i
never
been
in
places
so
discouraging
as
your
workhouses
they
take
one
very
heart
i
always
understood
said
shelton
coldly
that
our
system
was
better
than
that
of
other
ferrand
leaned
over
in
his
chair
an
elbow
on
his
knee
his
favourite
attitude
when
particularly
certain
of
his
point
well
he
replied
it
always
permissible
to
think
well
of
your
own
country
but
frankly
i
come
out
of
those
places
here
with
little
strength
and
no
heart
at
all
and
i
can
tell
you
his
lips
lost
their
bitterness
and
he
became
an
artist
expressing
the
result
of
his
experience
you
spend
your
money
freely
you
have
fine
buildings
officers
but
you
lack
the
spirit
of
hospitality
the
reason
is
plain
you
have
a
horror
of
the
needy
you
invite
us
and
when
we
come
you
treat
us
justly
enough
but
as
if
we
were
numbers
criminals
beneath
contempt
as
if
we
had
inflicted
a
personal
injury
on
you
and
when
we
get
out
again
we
are
naturally
shelton
bit
his
lips
how
much
money
will
you
want
for
your
ticket
and
to
make
a
start
he
asked
the
nervous
gesture
escaping
ferrand
at
this
juncture
betrayed
how
far
the
most
independent
thinkers
are
dependent
when
they
have
no
money
in
their
pockets
he
took
the
note
that
shelton
proffered
him
a
thousand
thanks
said
he
i
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
done
for
me
and
shelton
could
not
help
feeling
that
there
was
true
emotion
behind
his
titter
of
farewell
he
stood
at
the
window
watching
ferrand
start
into
the
world
again
then
looked
back
at
his
own
comfortable
room
with
the
number
of
things
that
had
accumulated
somehow
the
photographs
of
countless
friends
the
old
the
stock
of
coloured
pipes
into
him
restlessness
had
passed
with
the
farewell
clasp
of
the
foreigner
damp
hand
to
wait
about
in
london
was
unbearable
he
took
his
hat
and
heedless
of
direction
walked
towards
the
river
it
was
a
clear
bright
day
with
a
bleak
wind
driving
showers
before
it
during
one
of
such
shelton
found
himself
in
little
blank
street
i
wonder
how
that
little
frenchman
that
i
saw
is
getting
on
he
thought
on
a
fine
day
he
would
probably
have
passed
by
on
the
other
side
he
now
entered
and
tapped
upon
the
wicket
no
little
blank
street
had
abated
nothing
of
its
dreariness
the
same
blowsy
woman
answered
his
inquiry
yes
carolan
was
always
in
you
could
never
catch
him
out
seemed
afraid
to
go
into
the
street
to
her
call
the
little
frenchman
made
his
appearance
as
punctually
as
if
he
had
been
the
rabbit
of
a
conjurer
his
face
was
as
yellow
as
a
guinea
ah
it
you
monsieur
he
said
yes
said
shelton
and
how
are
you
it
five
days
since
i
came
out
of
hospital
muttered
the
little
frenchman
tapping
on
his
chest
a
crisis
of
this
bad
atmosphere
i
live
here
shut
up
in
a
box
it
does
me
harm
being
from
the
south
if
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
monsieur
it
will
give
me
nothing
replied
shelton
i
was
just
passing
and
thought
i
should
like
to
hear
how
you
were
getting
come
into
the
kitchen
monsieur
there
is
nobody
in
there
il
fait
un
froid
what
sort
of
customers
have
you
just
now
asked
shelton
as
they
passed
into
the
kitchen
always
the
same
clientele
replied
the
little
man
not
so
numerous
of
course
it
being
could
you
find
anything
better
than
this
to
do
the
barber
radiated
irony
when
i
first
came
to
london
said
he
i
secured
an
engagement
at
one
of
your
public
institutions
i
thought
my
fortune
made
imagine
monsieur
in
that
sacred
place
i
was
obliged
to
shave
at
the
rate
of
ten
a
penny
here
it
true
they
do
pay
me
half
the
time
but
when
paid
i
paid
in
this
climate
and
being
one
make
experiments
i
shall
finish
my
days
here
have
you
seen
that
young
man
who
interested
you
there
another
he
has
spirit
as
i
had
once
fait
de
la
philosophie
as
i
do
and
you
will
see
monsieur
it
will
finish
him
in
this
world
what
you
want
is
to
have
no
spirit
spirit
ruins
shelton
looked
sideways
at
the
little
man
with
his
sardonic
yellow
face
and
the
incongruity
of
the
word
spirit
in
his
mouth
struck
him
so
sharply
that
he
smiled
a
smile
with
more
pity
in
it
than
any
burst
of
tears
shall
we
down
he
said
offering
a
cigarette
merci
monsieur
it
is
always
a
pleasure
to
smoke
a
good
cigarette
you
remember
that
old
actor
who
gave
you
a
jeremiad
well
he
dead
i
was
the
only
one
at
his
bedside
vrai
drole
he
was
another
who
had
spirit
and
you
will
see
monsieur
that
young
man
in
whom
you
take
an
interest
he
die
in
a
hospital
or
in
some
hole
or
other
or
even
on
the
highroad
having
closed
his
eyes
once
too
often
some
cold
night
and
all
because
he
has
something
in
him
which
will
not
accept
things
as
they
are
believing
always
that
they
should
be
better
a
riens
de
plus
according
to
you
then
said
shelton
and
the
conversation
seemed
to
him
of
a
sudden
to
have
taken
too
personal
a
turn
rebellion
of
any
sort
is
ah
replied
the
little
man
with
the
eagerness
of
one
whose
ideal
it
is
to
sit
under
the
awning
of
a
cafe
and
talk
life
upside
down
you
pose
me
a
great
problem
there
if
one
makes
rebellion
it
is
always
probable
that
one
will
do
no
good
to
any
one
and
harm
one
self
the
law
of
the
majority
arranges
that
but
i
would
draw
your
attention
to
this
and
he
paused
as
if
it
were
a
real
discovery
to
blow
smoke
through
his
nose
if
you
rebel
it
is
in
all
likelihood
because
you
are
forced
by
your
nature
to
rebel
this
is
one
of
the
most
certain
things
in
life
in
any
case
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
falling
between
two
stools
which
is
unpardonable
he
ended
with
complacence
shelton
thought
he
had
never
seen
a
man
who
looked
more
completely
as
if
he
had
fallen
between
two
stools
and
he
had
inspiration
enough
to
feel
that
the
little
barber
intellectual
rebellion
and
the
action
logically
required
by
it
had
no
more
than
a
bowing
acquaintanceship
by
nature
went
on
the
little
man
i
am
an
optimist
it
is
in
consequence
of
this
that
i
now
make
pessimism
i
have
always
had
ideals
seeing
myself
cut
off
from
them
for
ever
i
must
complain
to
complain
monsieur
is
very
sweet
shelton
wondered
what
these
ideals
had
been
but
had
no
answer
ready
so
he
nodded
and
again
held
out
his
cigarettes
for
like
a
true
southerner
the
little
man
had
thrown
the
first
away
half
smoked
the
greatest
pleasure
in
life
continued
the
frenchman
with
a
bow
is
to
talk
a
little
to
a
being
who
is
capable
of
understanding
you
at
present
we
have
no
one
here
now
that
that
old
actor
dead
ah
there
was
a
man
who
was
rebellion
incarnate
he
made
rebellion
as
other
men
make
money
son
metier
when
he
was
no
longer
capable
of
active
revolution
he
made
it
getting
drunk
at
the
last
this
was
his
only
way
of
protesting
against
society
an
interesting
personality
le
regrette
beaucoup
but
as
you
see
he
died
in
great
distress
without
a
soul
to
wave
him
farewell
because
as
you
can
well
understand
monsieur
i
do
count
myself
he
died
drunk
un
shelton
had
continued
staring
kindly
at
the
little
man
the
barber
added
hastily
it
difficult
to
make
an
end
like
that
one
has
moments
of
yes
assented
shelton
one
has
the
little
barber
looked
at
him
with
cynical
discretion
oh
he
said
it
to
the
destitute
that
such
things
are
important
when
one
has
money
all
these
matters
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
smile
had
lodged
amongst
his
he
waved
his
hand
as
though
to
end
the
subject
a
sense
of
having
been
exposed
came
over
shelton
you
think
then
said
he
that
discontent
is
peculiar
to
the
destitute
monsieur
replied
the
little
barber
a
plutocrat
knows
too
well
that
if
he
mixes
in
that
there
not
a
dog
in
the
streets
more
lost
than
shelton
rose
the
rain
is
over
i
hope
you
soon
be
better
perhaps
you
accept
this
in
memory
of
that
old
actor
and
he
slipped
a
sovereign
into
the
little
frenchman
hand
the
latter
bowed
whenever
you
are
passing
monsieur
he
said
eagerly
i
shall
be
charmed
to
see
and
shelton
walked
away
a
dog
in
the
streets
more
lost
thought
he
now
what
did
he
mean
by
that
something
of
that
lost
dog
feeling
had
gripped
his
spirit
another
month
of
waiting
would
kill
all
the
savour
of
anticipation
might
even
kill
his
love
in
the
excitement
of
his
senses
and
his
nerves
caused
by
this
strain
of
waiting
everything
seemed
too
vivid
all
was
beyond
life
size
like
art
whose
truths
too
strong
for
daily
use
are
thus
unpopular
with
healthy
people
as
will
the
bones
in
a
worn
face
the
spirit
underlying
things
had
reached
the
surface
the
meanness
and
intolerable
measure
of
hard
facts
were
too
apparent
some
craving
for
help
some
instinct
drove
him
into
kensington
for
he
found
himself
before
his
mother
house
providence
seemed
bent
on
flinging
him
from
pole
to
pole
shelton
was
in
town
and
though
it
was
the
first
of
june
sat
warming
her
feet
before
a
fire
her
face
with
its
pleasant
colour
was
like
the
little
barber
but
from
optimism
not
rebellion
she
smiled
when
she
saw
her
son
and
the
wrinkles
round
her
eyes
twinkled
with
vitality
well
my
dear
boy
she
said
it
lovely
to
see
you
and
how
is
that
sweet
girl
very
well
thank
you
replied
shelton
she
must
be
such
a
dear
mother
stammered
shelton
i
must
give
it
give
it
up
my
dear
dick
give
what
up
you
look
quite
worried
come
and
sit
down
and
have
a
cosy
chat
cheer
up
and
shelton
with
her
head
askew
gazed
at
her
son
quite
irrepressibly
mother
said
shelton
who
confronted
by
her
optimism
had
never
since
his
time
of
trial
began
felt
so
wretchedly
dejected
i
ca
go
on
waiting
about
like
my
dear
boy
what
is
the
matter
everything
is
wrong
wrong
cried
shelton
come
tell
me
all
about
it
but
shelton
shook
his
head
you
surely
have
not
had
a
quarrel
shelton
stopped
the
question
seemed
so
vulgar
one
might
have
asked
it
of
a
groom
no
said
shelton
and
his
answer
sounded
like
a
groan
you
know
my
dear
old
dick
murmured
his
mother
it
seems
a
little
i
know
it
seems
come
said
shelton
taking
his
hand
between
her
own
you
never
used
to
be
like
no
said
shelton
with
a
laugh
i
never
used
to
be
like
shelton
snuggled
in
her
chuda
shawl
oh
she
said
with
cheery
sympathy
i
know
exactly
how
you
feel
shelton
holding
his
head
stared
at
the
fire
which
played
and
bubbled
like
his
mother
face
but
you
so
fond
of
each
other
she
began
again
such
a
sweet
girl
you
do
understand
muttered
shelton
gloomily
it
not
her
nothing
it
myself
shelton
again
seized
his
hand
and
this
time
pressed
it
to
her
soft
warm
cheek
that
had
lost
the
elasticity
of
youth
oh
she
cried
again
i
understand
i
know
exactly
what
you
but
shelton
saw
from
the
fixed
beam
in
her
eyes
that
she
had
not
an
inkling
to
do
him
justice
he
was
not
so
foolish
as
to
try
to
give
her
one
shelton
sighed
it
would
be
so
lovely
if
you
could
wake
up
and
think
differently
if
i
were
you
my
dear
i
would
have
a
good
long
walk
and
then
a
turkish
bath
and
then
i
would
just
write
to
her
and
tell
her
all
about
it
and
you
see
how
beautifully
it
all
come
straight
and
in
the
enthusiasm
of
advice
shelton
rose
and
with
a
faint
stretch
of
her
tiny
figure
still
so
young
clasped
her
hands
together
now
do
that
a
dear
old
dick
you
just
see
how
lovely
it
be
shelton
smiled
he
had
not
the
heart
to
chase
away
this
vision
and
give
her
my
warmest
love
and
tell
her
i
longing
for
the
wedding
come
now
my
dear
boy
promise
me
that
what
you
and
shelton
said
i
think
about
shelton
had
taken
up
her
stand
with
one
foot
on
the
fender
in
spite
of
her
sciatica
cheer
up
she
cried
her
eyes
beamed
as
if
intoxicated
by
her
sympathy
wonderful
woman
the
uncomplicated
optimism
that
carried
her
through
good
and
ill
had
not
descended
to
her
son
from
pole
to
pole
he
had
been
thrown
that
day
from
the
french
barber
whose
intellect
accepted
nothing
without
carping
and
whose
little
fingers
worked
all
day
to
save
himself
from
dying
out
to
his
own
mother
whose
intellect
accepted
anything
presented
with
sufficient
glow
but
who
until
she
died
would
never
stir
a
finger
when
shelton
reached
his
rooms
he
wrote
to
antonia
i
ca
wait
about
in
london
any
longer
i
am
going
down
to
bideford
to
start
a
walking
tour
i
shall
work
my
way
to
oxford
and
stay
there
till
i
may
come
to
holm
oaks
i
shall
send
you
my
address
do
write
as
usual
he
collected
all
the
photographs
he
had
of
her
amateur
groups
taken
by
dennant
and
packed
them
in
the
pocket
of
his
there
was
one
where
she
was
standing
just
below
her
little
brother
who
was
perched
upon
a
wall
in
her
eyes
round
throat
and
softly
tilted
chin
there
was
something
cool
and
watchful
protecting
the
ragamuffin
up
above
her
head
this
he
kept
apart
to
be
looked
at
daily
as
a
man

the
indian
civilian
one
morning
then
a
week
later
shelton
found
himself
at
the
walls
of
princetown
prison
he
had
seen
this
lugubrious
stone
cage
before
but
the
magic
of
his
morning
walk
across
the
moor
the
sight
of
the
pagan
tors
the
songs
of
the
last
cuckoo
had
unprepared
him
for
that
dreary
building
he
left
the
street
and
entering
the
fosse
began
a
circuit
scanning
the
walls
with
morbid
fascination
this
then
was
the
system
by
which
men
enforced
the
will
of
the
majority
and
it
was
suddenly
borne
in
on
him
that
all
the
ideas
and
maxims
which
his
christian
countrymen
believed
themselves
to
be
fulfilling
daily
were
stultified
in
every
cellule
of
the
social
honeycomb
such
teachings
as
he
that
is
without
sin
amongst
you
had
been
pronounced
unpractical
by
peers
and
judges
bishops
statesmen
merchants
husbands
in
fact
by
every
truly
christian
person
in
the
country
yes
thought
shelton
as
if
he
had
found
out
something
new
the
more
christian
the
nation
the
less
it
has
to
do
with
the
christian
society
was
a
charitable
organisation
giving
nothing
for
nothing
little
for
sixpence
and
it
was
only
fear
that
forced
it
to
give
at
all
he
took
a
seat
on
a
wall
and
began
to
watch
a
warder
who
was
slowly
paring
a
last
year
apple
the
expression
of
his
face
the
way
he
stood
with
his
solid
legs
apart
his
head
poked
forward
and
his
lower
jaw
thrust
out
all
made
him
a
perfect
pillar
of
society
he
was
undisturbed
by
shelton
scrutiny
watching
the
rind
coil
down
below
the
apple
until
in
a
springing
spiral
it
fell
on
the
path
and
collapsed
like
a
toy
snake
he
took
a
bite
his
teeth
were
jagged
and
his
mouth
immense
it
was
obvious
that
he
considered
himself
a
most
superior
man
shelton
frowned
got
down
slowly
from
the
wall
and
proceeded
on
his
way
a
little
further
down
the
hill
he
stopped
again
to
watch
a
group
of
convicts
in
a
field
they
seemed
to
be
dancing
in
a
slow
and
sad
cotillon
while
behind
the
hedge
on
every
side
were
warders
armed
with
guns
just
such
a
sight
substituting
spears
could
have
been
seen
in
roman
times
while
he
thus
stood
looking
a
man
walking
rapidly
stopped
beside
him
and
asked
how
many
miles
it
was
to
exeter
his
round
visage
and
long
brown
eyes
sliding
about
beneath
their
brows
his
cropped
hair
and
short
neck
seemed
familiar
your
name
is
crocker
is
it
why
it
the
bird
exclaimed
the
traveller
putting
out
his
hand
have
seen
you
since
we
both
went
shelton
returned
his
handgrip
crocker
had
lived
above
his
head
at
college
and
often
kept
him
sleepless
half
the
night
by
playing
on
the
hautboy
where
have
you
sprung
from
india
got
my
long
leave
i
say
are
you
going
this
way
let
go
they
went
and
very
fast
faster
and
faster
every
minute
where
are
you
going
at
this
pace
asked
shelton
oh
only
as
far
as
london
i
set
myself
to
do
it
in
a
are
you
in
training
you
kill
crocker
answered
with
a
chuckle
shelton
noted
with
alarm
the
expression
of
his
eye
there
was
a
sort
of
stubborn
aspiration
in
it
still
an
idealist
he
thought
poor
fellow
well
he
inquired
what
sort
of
a
time
have
you
had
in
india
oh
said
the
indian
civilian
absently
i
had
the
good
god
crocker
smiled
and
added
caught
it
on
famine
i
see
said
shelton
plague
and
famine
i
suppose
you
fellows
really
think
you
doing
good
out
there
his
companion
looked
at
him
surprised
then
answered
modestly
we
get
very
good
that
the
great
thing
responded
shelton
after
a
moment
silence
crocker
looking
straight
before
him
asked
do
you
think
we
are
doing
good
i
not
an
authority
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
crocker
seemed
disconcerted
why
he
bluntly
asked
shelton
was
not
anxious
to
explain
his
views
and
he
did
not
reply
his
friend
repeated
why
do
you
think
we
doing
good
in
india
well
said
shelton
gruffly
how
can
progress
be
imposed
on
nations
from
outside
the
indian
civilian
glancing
at
shelton
in
an
affectionate
and
doubtful
way
replied
you
have
changed
a
bit
old
no
no
said
shelton
you
not
going
to
get
out
of
it
that
way
give
me
a
single
example
of
a
nation
or
an
individual
for
that
matter
who
ever
done
any
good
without
having
worked
up
to
it
from
crocker
grunting
muttered
that
it
said
shelton
we
take
peoples
entirely
different
from
our
own
and
stop
their
natural
development
by
substituting
a
civilisation
grown
for
our
own
use
suppose
looking
at
a
tropical
fern
in
a
hothouse
you
were
to
say
heat
unhealthy
for
me
therefore
it
must
be
bad
for
the
fern
i
take
it
up
and
plant
it
outside
in
the
fresh
do
you
know
that
means
giving
up
india
said
the
indian
civilian
shrewdly
i
do
say
that
but
to
talk
about
doing
good
to
india
is
h
crocker
knitted
his
brows
trying
to
see
the
point
of
view
his
friend
was
showing
him
come
now
should
we
go
on
administering
india
if
it
were
dead
loss
no
well
to
talk
about
administering
the
country
for
the
purpose
of
pocketing
money
is
cynical
and
there
generally
some
truth
in
cynicism
but
to
talk
about
the
administration
of
a
country
by
which
we
profit
as
if
it
were
a
great
and
good
thing
is
cant
i
hit
you
in
the
wind
for
the
benefit
of
myself
all
right
law
of
nature
but
to
say
it
does
you
good
at
the
same
time
is
beyond
no
no
returned
crocker
grave
and
anxious
you
ca
persuade
me
that
we
not
doing
wait
a
bit
it
all
a
question
of
horizons
you
look
at
it
from
too
close
put
the
horizon
further
back
you
hit
india
in
the
wind
and
say
it
virtuous
well
now
let
see
what
happens
either
the
wind
never
comes
back
and
india
gasps
to
an
untimely
death
or
the
wind
does
come
back
and
in
the
pant
of
reaction
your
blow
that
to
say
your
labour
is
lost
morally
lost
labour
that
you
might
have
spent
where
it
would
have
been
are
you
an
imperialist
asked
crocker
genuinely
concerned
i
may
be
but
i
keep
my
mouth
shut
about
the
benefits
we
conferring
upon
other
then
you
ca
believe
in
abstract
right
or
justice
what
on
earth
have
our
ideas
of
justice
or
right
got
to
do
with
india
if
i
thought
as
you
do
sighed
the
unhappy
crocker
i
should
be
all
quite
so
we
always
think
our
standards
best
for
the
whole
world
a
capital
belief
for
us
read
the
speeches
of
our
public
men
does
it
strike
you
as
amazing
how
sure
they
are
of
being
in
the
right
so
charming
to
benefit
yourself
and
others
at
the
same
time
though
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
one
man
meat
is
usually
poison
look
at
nature
but
in
england
we
never
look
at
nature
no
necessity
our
national
point
of
view
has
filled
our
pockets
all
that
i
say
old
chap
that
awfully
bitter
said
crocker
with
a
sort
of
wondering
sadness
it
enough
to
make
any
one
bitter
the
way
we
pharisees
wax
fat
and
at
the
same
time
give
ourselves
the
moral
airs
of
a
balloon
i
must
stick
a
pin
in
sometimes
just
to
hear
the
gas
shelton
was
surprised
at
his
own
heat
and
for
some
strange
reason
thought
of
antonia
surely
she
was
not
a
pharisee
his
companion
strode
along
and
shelton
felt
sorry
for
the
signs
of
trouble
on
his
face
to
fill
your
pockets
said
crocker
is
the
main
thing
one
has
just
got
to
do
things
without
thinking
of
why
we
do
do
you
ever
see
the
other
side
to
any
question
asked
shelton
i
suppose
not
you
always
begin
to
act
before
you
stop
thinking
you
crocker
grinned
he
a
pharisee
too
thought
shelton
without
a
pharisee
pride
queer
thing
that
after
walking
some
distance
as
if
thinking
deeply
crocker
chuckled
out
you
not
consistent
you
ought
to
be
in
favour
of
giving
up
shelton
smiled
uneasily
why
should
we
fill
our
pockets
i
only
object
to
the
humbug
that
we
the
indian
civilian
put
his
hand
shyly
through
his
arm
if
i
thought
like
you
he
said
i
could
stay
another
day
in
and
to
this
shelton
made
no
reply
the
wind
had
now
begun
to
drop
and
something
of
the
morning
magic
was
stealing
again
upon
the
moor
they
were
nearing
the
outskirt
fields
of
cultivation
it
was
past
five
when
dropping
from
the
level
of
the
tors
they
came
into
the
sunny
vale
of
monkland
they
say
said
crocker
reading
from
his
they
say
this
place
occupies
a
position
of
unique
the
two
travellers
in
tranquil
solitude
took
their
seats
under
an
old
on
the
village
green
the
smoke
of
their
pipes
the
sleepy
air
the
warmth
from
the
baked
ground
the
constant
hum
made
shelton
drowsy
do
you
remember
his
companion
asked
those
you
used
to
have
with
busgate
and
old
halidome
in
my
rooms
on
sunday
evenings
how
is
old
halidome
married
replied
shelton
crocker
sighed
and
are
you
he
asked
not
yet
said
shelton
grimly
i
crocker
took
hold
of
his
arm
above
the
elbow
and
squeezing
it
he
grunted
shelton
had
not
received
congratulations
that
pleased
him
more
there
was
the
spice
of
envy
in
them
i
should
like
to
get
married
while
i
home
said
the
civilian
after
a
long
pause
his
legs
were
stretched
apart
throwing
shadows
on
the
green
his
hands
deep
thrust
into
his
pockets
his
head
a
little
to
one
side
an
smile
played
round
his
mouth
the
sun
had
sunk
behind
a
tor
but
the
warmth
kept
rising
from
the
ground
and
the
on
a
cottage
bathed
them
with
its
spicy
perfume
from
the
converging
lanes
figures
passed
now
and
then
lounged
by
staring
at
the
strangers
gossiping
amongst
themselves
and
vanished
into
the
cottages
that
headed
the
incline
a
clock
struck
seven
and
round
the
shady
a
chafer
or
some
heavy
insect
commenced
its
booming
rushes
all
was
marvellously
sane
and
slumbrous
the
soft
air
the
drawling
voices
the
shapes
and
murmurs
the
rising
smell
of
from
fires
were
full
of
the
spirit
of
security
and
of
home
the
outside
world
was
far
indeed
typical
of
some
island
nation
was
this
nest
of
refuge
where
men
grew
quietly
tall
fattened
and
without
fuss
dropped
off
their
perches
where
contentment
flourished
as
sunflowers
flourished
in
the
sun
crocker
cap
slipped
off
he
was
nodding
and
shelton
looked
at
him
from
a
manor
house
in
some
such
village
he
had
issued
to
one
of
a
thousand
such
homes
he
would
find
his
way
at
last
untouched
by
the
struggles
with
famines
or
with
plagues
uninfected
in
his
fibre
his
prejudices
and
his
principles
unchanged
by
contact
with
strange
peoples
new
conditions
odd
feelings
or
queer
points
of
view
the
chafer
buzzed
against
his
shoulder
gathered
flight
again
and
boomed
away
crocker
roused
himself
and
turning
his
amiable
face
jogged
shelton
arm
what
are
you
thinking
about
bird
he
asked
chapter
xvii
a
parson
shelton
continued
to
travel
with
his
college
friend
and
on
wednesday
night
four
days
after
joining
company
they
reached
the
village
of
dowdenhame
all
day
long
the
road
had
lain
through
pastureland
with
thick
green
hedges
and
heavily
feathered
elms
once
or
twice
they
had
broken
the
monotony
by
a
stretch
along
the
of
a
canal
which
choked
with
plants
and
shining
weeds
brooded
sluggishly
beside
the
fields
nature
in
one
of
her
ironic
moods
had
cast
a
grey
and
cloak
over
all
the
country
bland
luxuriance
from
dawn
till
darkness
fell
there
had
been
no
movement
in
the
steely
distant
sky
a
cold
wind
ruffed
in
the
and
sent
shivers
through
the
branches
of
the
elms
the
cattle
dappled
pied
or
bay
or
white
continued
grazing
with
an
air
of
grumbling
at
their
birthright
in
a
meadow
close
to
the
canal
shelton
saw
five
magpies
and
about
five
the
rain
began
a
steady
rain
which
crocker
looking
at
the
sky
declared
was
going
to
be
over
in
a
minute
but
it
was
not
over
in
a
minute
they
were
soon
drenched
shelton
was
tired
and
it
annoyed
him
very
much
that
his
companion
who
was
also
tired
should
grow
more
cheerful
his
thoughts
kept
harping
upon
ferrand
this
must
be
something
like
what
he
described
to
me
tramping
on
and
on
when
you
until
you
can
cadge
up
supper
and
a
and
sulkily
he
kept
on
ploughing
through
the
mud
with
glances
at
the
exasperating
crocker
who
had
skinned
one
heel
and
was
limping
horribly
it
suddenly
came
home
to
him
that
life
for
three
quarters
of
the
world
meant
physical
exhaustion
every
day
without
a
possibility
of
alternative
and
that
as
soon
as
for
some
cause
beyond
control
they
failed
thus
to
exhaust
themselves
they
were
reduced
to
beg
or
starve
and
then
we
who
do
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
exhaustion
call
them
scamps
he
said
aloud
it
was
past
nine
and
dark
when
they
reached
dowdenhame
the
street
yielded
no
accommodation
and
while
debating
where
to
go
they
passed
the
church
with
a
square
tower
and
next
to
it
a
house
which
was
certainly
the
parsonage
suppose
said
crocker
leaning
on
his
arms
upon
the
gate
we
ask
him
where
to
go
and
without
waiting
for
shelton
answer
he
rang
the
bell
the
door
was
opened
by
the
parson
a
bloodless
and
man
whose
hollow
cheeks
and
bony
hands
suggested
a
perpetual
struggle
ascetically
benevolent
were
his
grey
eyes
a
pale
and
ghostly
smile
played
on
the
curves
of
his
thin
lips
what
can
i
do
for
you
he
asked
inn
yes
there
the
blue
chequers
but
i
afraid
you
find
it
shut
they
early
people
i
glad
to
say
and
his
eyes
seemed
to
muse
over
the
proper
fold
for
these
damp
sheep
are
you
oxford
men
by
any
chance
he
asked
as
if
that
might
throw
some
light
upon
the
matter
of
mary
really
i
of
myself
ladyman
billington
ladyman
you
might
remember
my
youngest
brother
i
could
give
you
a
room
here
if
you
could
manage
without
sheets
my
housekeeper
has
two
days
holiday
she
foolishly
taken
the
shelton
accepted
gladly
feeling
that
the
intonation
in
the
voice
was
necessary
unto
his
calling
and
that
he
did
not
want
to
patronise
you
hungry
i
expect
after
your
tramp
i
very
much
afraid
there
er
nothing
in
the
house
but
bread
i
could
boil
you
water
hot
lemonade
is
better
than
conducting
them
into
the
kitchen
he
made
a
fire
and
put
a
kettle
on
to
boil
then
after
leaving
them
to
shed
their
soaking
clothes
returned
with
ancient
greenish
coats
some
carpet
slippers
and
some
blankets
wrapped
in
these
and
carrying
their
glasses
the
travellers
followed
to
the
study
where
by
doubtful
he
seemed
from
books
upon
the
table
to
have
been
working
at
his
sermon
we
giving
you
a
lot
of
trouble
said
shelton
it
really
very
good
of
not
at
all
the
parson
answered
i
only
grieved
the
house
is
it
was
a
truly
dismal
contrast
to
the
fatness
of
the
land
they
had
been
passing
through
and
the
parson
voice
issuing
from
bloodless
lips
although
complacent
was
pathetic
it
was
peculiar
that
voice
of
his
seeming
to
indicate
an
intimate
acquaintanceship
with
what
was
fat
and
fine
to
convey
contempt
for
the
vulgar
need
of
money
while
all
the
time
his
eyes
those
watery
ascetic
eyes
as
plain
as
speech
they
said
oh
to
know
what
it
must
be
like
to
have
a
pound
or
two
to
spare
just
once
a
year
or
so
everything
in
the
room
had
been
bought
for
cheapness
no
luxuries
were
there
and
necessaries
not
enough
it
was
bleak
and
bare
the
ceiling
cracked
the
discoloured
and
those
books
prim
shining
books
with
arms
stamped
on
them
glared
in
the
surrounding
barrenness
my
predecessor
said
the
parson
played
rather
havoc
with
the
house
the
poor
fellow
had
a
dreadful
struggle
i
was
told
you
can
unfortunately
expect
nothing
else
these
days
when
livings
have
come
down
so
terribly
in
value
he
was
a
married
man
large
family
crocker
who
had
drunk
his
steaming
lemonade
was
smiling
and
already
nodding
in
his
chair
with
his
black
garment
buttoned
closely
round
his
throat
his
long
legs
rolled
up
in
a
blanket
and
stretched
towards
the
feeble
flame
of
the
fire
he
had
a
rather
patchy
air
shelton
on
the
other
hand
had
lost
his
feeling
of
fatigue
the
strangeness
of
the
place
was
stimulating
his
brain
he
kept
stealing
glances
at
the
scantiness
around
the
room
the
parson
the
furniture
the
very
fire
all
gave
him
the
feeling
caused
by
seeing
legs
that
have
outgrown
their
trousers
but
there
was
something
underlying
that
leanness
of
the
landscape
something
superior
and
academic
which
defied
all
sympathy
it
was
pure
nervousness
which
made
him
say
ah
why
do
they
have
such
families
a
faint
red
mounted
to
the
parson
cheeks
its
appearance
there
was
startling
and
crocker
chuckled
as
a
sleepy
man
will
chuckle
who
feels
bound
to
show
that
he
is
not
asleep
it
very
unfortunate
murmured
the
parson
certainly
in
many
shelton
would
now
have
changed
the
subject
but
at
this
moment
the
unhappy
crocker
snored
being
a
man
of
action
he
had
gone
to
sleep
it
seems
to
me
said
shelton
hurriedly
as
he
saw
the
eyebrows
rising
at
the
sound
almost
what
you
might
call
dear
me
but
how
can
it
be
wrong
shelton
now
felt
that
he
must
justify
his
saying
somehow
i
do
know
he
said
only
one
hears
of
such
a
lot
of
cases
clergymen
families
i
two
uncles
of
my
own
who
a
new
expression
gathered
on
the
parson
face
his
mouth
had
tightened
and
his
chin
receded
slightly
why
he
like
a
mule
thought
shelton
his
eyes
too
had
grown
harder
greyer
and
more
parroty
shelton
no
longer
liked
his
face
perhaps
you
and
i
the
parson
said
would
not
understand
each
other
on
such
and
shelton
felt
ashamed
i
should
like
to
ask
you
a
question
in
turn
however
the
parson
said
as
if
desirous
of
meeting
shelton
on
his
low
ground
how
do
you
justify
marriage
if
it
is
not
to
follow
the
laws
of
nature
i
can
only
tell
you
what
i
personally
my
dear
sir
you
forget
that
a
woman
chief
delight
is
in
her
i
should
have
thought
it
a
pleasure
likely
to
pall
with
too
much
repetition
motherhood
is
motherhood
whether
of
one
or
of
a
i
afraid
replied
the
parson
with
impatience
though
still
keeping
on
his
guest
low
ground
your
theories
are
not
calculated
to
populate
the
have
you
ever
lived
in
london
shelton
asked
it
always
makes
me
feel
a
doubt
whether
we
have
any
right
to
have
children
at
surely
said
the
parson
with
wonderful
restraint
and
the
joints
of
his
fingers
cracked
with
the
grip
he
had
upon
his
chair
you
are
leaving
out
duty
towards
the
country
national
growth
is
paramount
there
are
two
ways
of
looking
at
that
it
depends
on
what
you
want
your
country
to
i
did
know
said
the
parson
fanaticism
now
had
crept
into
his
smile
there
could
be
any
doubt
on
such
a
the
more
shelton
felt
that
commands
were
being
given
him
the
more
controversial
he
naturally
became
apart
from
the
merits
of
this
subject
to
which
he
had
hardly
ever
given
thought
i
dare
say
i
wrong
he
said
fastening
his
eyes
on
the
blanket
in
which
his
legs
were
wrapped
but
it
seems
to
me
at
least
an
open
question
whether
it
better
for
the
country
to
be
so
well
populated
as
to
be
quite
incapable
of
supporting
surely
said
the
parson
whose
face
regained
its
pallor
you
not
a
little
englander
on
shelton
this
phrase
had
a
mysterious
effect
resisting
an
impulse
to
discover
what
he
really
was
he
answered
hastily
of
course
i
not
the
parson
followed
up
his
triumph
and
shifting
the
ground
of
the
discussion
from
shelton
to
his
own
he
gravely
said
surely
you
must
see
that
your
theory
is
founded
in
immorality
it
is
if
i
may
say
so
extravagant
even
but
shelton
suffering
from
irritation
at
his
own
dishonesty
replied
with
heat
why
not
say
at
once
sir
unhealthy
any
opinion
which
goes
contrary
to
that
of
the
majority
is
always
called
so
i
well
returned
the
parson
whose
eyes
seemed
trying
to
bind
shelton
to
his
will
i
must
say
your
ideas
do
seem
to
me
both
extravagant
and
unhealthy
the
propagation
of
children
is
enjoined
of
shelton
bowed
above
his
blanket
but
the
parson
did
not
smile
we
live
in
very
dangerous
times
he
said
and
it
grieves
me
when
a
man
of
your
standing
panders
to
these
those
said
shelton
whom
the
shoe
does
pinch
make
this
rule
of
morality
and
thrust
it
on
to
such
as
the
shoe
does
the
rule
was
never
made
said
the
parson
it
was
given
oh
said
shelton
i
beg
your
he
was
in
danger
of
forgetting
the
delicate
position
he
was
in
he
wants
to
ram
his
notions
down
my
throat
he
thought
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
parson
face
had
grown
more
like
a
mule
his
accent
more
superior
his
eyes
more
dictatorial
to
be
right
in
this
argument
seemed
now
of
great
importance
whereas
in
truth
it
was
of
no
importance
whatsoever
that
which
however
was
important
was
the
fact
that
in
nothing
could
they
ever
have
agreed
but
crocker
had
suddenly
ceased
to
snore
his
head
had
fallen
so
that
a
peculiar
whistling
arose
instead
both
shelton
and
the
parson
looked
at
him
and
the
sight
sobered
them
your
friend
seems
very
tired
said
the
parson
shelton
forgot
all
his
annoyance
for
his
host
seemed
suddenly
pathetic
with
those
baggy
garments
hollow
cheeks
and
the
slightly
reddened
nose
that
comes
from
not
imbibing
quite
enough
a
kind
fellow
after
all
the
kind
fellow
rose
and
putting
his
hands
behind
his
back
placed
himself
before
the
blackening
fire
whole
centuries
of
authority
stood
behind
him
it
was
an
accident
that
the
mantelpiece
was
chipped
and
rusty
the
bent
and
worn
his
linen
frayed
about
the
cuffs
i
do
wish
to
dictate
said
he
but
where
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
wholly
wrong
in
that
your
ideas
foster
in
women
those
lax
views
of
the
family
life
that
are
so
prevalent
in
society
thoughts
of
antonia
with
her
candid
eyes
the
touch
of
freckling
on
her
skin
the
fair
hair
gathered
back
sprang
up
in
shelton
and
that
word
lax
seemed
ridiculous
and
the
women
he
was
wont
to
see
dragging
about
the
streets
of
london
with
two
or
three
small
children
women
bent
beneath
the
weight
of
babies
that
they
could
not
leave
women
going
to
work
with
babies
still
unborn
women
impecunious
mothers
in
his
own
class
with
twelve
or
fourteen
children
all
the
victims
of
the
sanctity
of
marriage
and
again
the
word
lax
seemed
to
be
ridiculous
we
are
not
put
into
the
world
to
exercise
our
wits
muttered
shelton
our
wanton
wills
the
parson
said
severely
that
sir
may
have
been
all
right
for
the
last
generation
the
country
is
more
crowded
now
i
ca
see
why
we
should
decide
it
for
such
a
view
of
morality
said
the
parson
looking
down
at
crocker
with
a
ghostly
smile
to
me
is
cracker
whistling
grew
in
tone
and
in
variety
what
i
hate
said
shelton
is
the
way
we
men
decide
what
women
are
to
bear
and
then
call
them
immoral
decadent
or
what
you
will
if
they
do
fall
in
with
our
mr
shelton
said
the
parson
i
think
we
may
safely
leave
it
in
the
hands
of
shelton
was
silent
the
questions
of
morality
said
the
parson
promptly
have
always
lain
through
god
in
the
hands
of
men
not
women
we
are
the
reasonable
shelton
stubbornly
replied
we
certainly
the
greater
humbugs
if
that
the
this
is
too
bad
exclaimed
the
parson
with
some
heat
i
sorry
sir
but
how
can
you
expect
women
nowadays
to
have
the
same
views
as
our
grandmothers
we
men
by
our
commercial
enterprise
have
brought
about
a
different
state
of
things
yet
for
the
sake
of
our
own
comfort
we
try
to
keep
women
where
they
were
it
always
those
men
who
are
most
keen
about
their
comfort
and
in
his
heat
the
sarcasm
of
using
the
word
comfort
in
that
room
was
lost
on
him
who
are
so
ready
to
accuse
women
of
deserting
the
old
the
parson
quivered
with
impatient
irony
old
morality
new
morality
he
said
these
are
strange
forgive
me
explained
shelton
we
talking
of
working
morality
i
imagine
there
not
a
man
in
a
million
fit
to
talk
of
true
the
eyes
of
his
host
contracted
i
think
he
said
and
his
voice
sounded
as
if
he
had
pinched
it
in
the
endeavour
to
impress
his
listener
that
any
man
who
honestly
tries
to
serve
his
god
has
the
right
humbly
i
say
humbly
to
claim
shelton
was
on
the
point
of
saying
something
bitter
but
checked
himself
here
am
i
thought
he
trying
to
get
the
last
word
like
an
old
at
this
moment
there
was
heard
a
piteous
mewing
the
parson
went
towards
the
door
excuse
me
a
moment
i
afraid
that
one
of
my
cats
out
in
the
he
returned
a
minute
later
with
a
wet
cat
in
his
arms
they
will
get
out
he
said
to
shelton
with
a
smile
on
his
thin
face
suffused
by
stooping
and
absently
he
stroked
the
dripping
cat
while
a
drop
of
wet
ran
off
his
nose
poor
pussy
poor
pussy
the
sound
of
that
poor
pussy
like
nothing
human
in
its
cracked
superiority
the
softness
of
that
smile
like
the
smile
of
gentleness
itself
haunted
shelton
till
he
fell
asleep
chapter
xviii
academic
the
last
sunlight
was
playing
on
the
roofs
when
the
travellers
entered
that
high
street
grave
and
holy
to
all
oxford
men
the
spirit
hovering
above
the
spires
was
as
different
from
its
concretions
in
their
caps
and
gowns
as
ever
the
spirit
of
christ
was
from
church
dogmas
shall
we
go
into
asked
shelton
as
they
passed
the
club
but
each
looked
at
his
clothes
for
two
elegant
young
men
in
flannel
suits
were
coming
out
you
go
said
crocker
with
a
smirk
shelton
shook
his
head
never
before
had
he
felt
such
love
for
this
old
city
it
was
gone
now
from
out
his
life
but
everything
about
it
seemed
so
good
and
fine
even
its
exclusive
air
was
not
ignoble
clothed
in
the
calm
of
history
the
golden
web
of
glorious
tradition
radiant
with
the
alchemy
of
memories
it
bewitched
him
like
the
perfume
of
a
dress
at
the
entrance
of
a
college
they
glanced
in
at
the
cool
grey
patch
of
stone
beyond
and
the
scarlet
of
a
window
flowerbox
secluded
mysteriously
calm
a
narrow
vision
of
the
sacred
past
pale
and
a
youth
with
pimply
face
and
random
nose
grabbing
at
his
cloven
gown
was
gazing
at
the
noticeboard
the
college
porter
large
man
and
stood
at
his
lodge
door
in
a
frank
and
deferential
attitude
an
image
of
routine
he
looked
like
one
engaged
to
give
a
decorous
air
to
multitudes
of
pecadilloes
his
blue
eyes
rested
on
the
travellers
i
do
know
you
sirs
but
if
you
want
to
speak
i
shall
be
glad
to
hear
the
observations
you
may
have
to
make
they
seemed
to
say
against
the
wall
reposed
a
bicycle
with
buckled
to
its
handle
a
bitch
working
her
snout
from
side
to
side
was
snuffling
horribly
the
great
door
to
which
her
chain
was
fastened
stayed
immovable
through
this
narrow
mouth
human
metal
had
been
poured
for
centuries
poured
moulded
given
back
come
along
said
shelton
they
now
entered
the
bishop
head
and
had
their
dinner
in
the
room
where
shelton
had
given
his
derby
dinner
to
youths
here
was
the
picture
of
the
racehorse
that
the
wineglass
thrown
by
one
of
them
had
missed
when
it
hit
the
waiter
and
there
serving
crocker
with
anchovy
sauce
was
the
very
waiter
when
they
had
finished
shelton
felt
the
old
desire
to
rise
with
difficulty
from
the
table
the
old
longing
to
patrol
the
streets
with
arm
hooked
in
some
other
arm
the
old
eagerness
to
dare
and
do
something
heroic
and
unlawful
the
old
sense
that
he
was
of
the
forest
set
in
the
forest
college
of
the
forest
country
in
the
finest
world
the
streets
all
grave
and
mellow
in
the
sunset
seemed
to
applaud
this
stroll
the
entrance
quad
of
his
old
college
spaciously
majestic
monastically
modern
for
years
the
heart
of
his
universe
the
focus
of
what
had
gone
before
it
in
his
life
casting
the
shadow
of
its
grey
walls
over
all
that
had
come
him
a
sense
of
rest
from
conflict
and
trust
in
his
own
important
safety
the
whose
lofty
spikes
he
had
so
often
crowned
with
empty
failed
to
rouse
him
nor
when
they
passed
the
staircase
where
he
had
flung
a
leg
of
lamb
at
some
indelicate
disturbing
tutor
did
he
feel
remorse
high
on
that
staircase
were
the
rooms
in
which
he
had
crammed
for
his
degree
upon
the
system
by
which
the
scholar
simmers
on
the
fire
of
cramming
boils
over
at
the
moment
of
examination
and
is
extinct
for
ever
after
his
coach
face
recurred
to
him
a
man
with
thrusting
eyes
who
reeled
off
knowledge
all
the
week
and
disappeared
to
town
on
sundays
they
passed
their
tutor
staircase
i
wonder
if
little
turl
would
remember
us
said
crocker
i
should
like
to
see
him
shall
we
go
and
look
him
up
little
turl
said
shelton
dreamily
mounting
they
knocked
upon
a
solid
door
come
in
said
the
voice
of
sleep
itself
a
little
man
with
a
pink
face
and
large
red
ears
was
sitting
in
a
fat
pink
chair
as
if
he
had
been
grown
there
what
do
you
want
he
asked
of
them
blinking
do
you
know
me
sir
god
bless
me
crocker
is
it
i
did
recognise
you
with
a
crocker
who
had
not
been
shaved
since
starting
on
his
travels
chuckled
feebly
you
remember
shelton
sir
he
said
shelton
oh
yes
how
do
you
do
shelton
sit
down
take
a
cigar
and
crossing
his
fat
little
legs
the
little
gentleman
looked
them
up
and
down
with
drowsy
interest
as
who
should
say
now
after
all
you
know
why
come
and
wake
me
up
like
this
shelton
and
crocker
took
two
other
chairs
they
too
seemed
thinking
yes
why
did
we
come
and
wake
him
up
like
this
and
shelton
who
could
not
tell
the
reason
why
took
refuge
in
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
the
panelled
walls
were
hung
with
prints
of
celebrated
greek
remains
the
soft
thick
carpet
on
the
floor
was
grateful
to
his
tired
feet
the
backs
of
many
books
gleamed
richly
in
the
light
of
the
oil
lamps
the
culture
and
tobacco
smoke
stole
on
his
senses
he
but
vaguely
comprehended
crocker
amiable
talk
vaguely
the
answers
of
his
little
host
whose
face
blinking
behind
the
bowl
of
his
huge
meerschaum
pipe
had
such
a
queer
resemblance
to
a
moon
the
door
was
opened
and
a
tall
creature
whose
eyes
were
large
and
brown
whose
face
was
rosy
and
ironical
entered
with
a
manly
stride
oh
he
said
looking
round
him
with
his
chin
a
little
in
the
air
am
i
intruding
turl
the
little
host
blinking
more
than
ever
murmured
not
at
all
berryman
take
a
pew
the
visitor
called
berryman
sat
down
and
gazed
up
at
the
wall
with
his
fine
eyes
shelton
had
a
faint
remembrance
of
this
don
and
bowed
but
the
newcomer
sat
smiling
and
did
not
notice
the
salute
trimmer
and
washer
are
coming
round
he
said
and
as
he
spoke
the
door
opened
to
admit
these
gentlemen
of
the
same
height
but
different
appearance
their
manner
was
faintly
jocular
faintly
supercilious
as
if
they
tolerated
everything
the
one
whose
name
was
trimmer
had
patches
of
red
on
his
large
and
on
his
cheeks
a
bluish
tint
his
lips
were
rather
full
so
that
he
had
a
likeness
to
a
spider
washer
who
was
thin
and
pale
wore
an
intellectual
smile
the
little
fat
host
moved
the
hand
that
held
the
meerschaum
crocker
shelton
he
said
an
awkward
silence
followed
shelton
tried
to
rouse
the
cultured
portion
of
his
wits
but
the
sense
that
nothing
would
be
treated
seriously
paralysed
his
faculties
he
stayed
silent
staring
at
the
glowing
tip
of
his
cigar
it
seemed
to
him
unfair
to
have
intruded
on
these
gentlemen
without
its
having
been
made
quite
clear
to
them
beforehand
who
and
what
he
was
he
rose
to
take
his
leave
but
washer
had
begun
to
speak
madame
bovary
he
said
quizzically
reading
the
title
of
the
book
on
the
little
fat
man
bookrest
and
holding
it
closer
to
his
eyes
he
repeated
as
though
it
were
a
joke
madame
bovary
do
you
mean
to
say
turl
that
you
can
stand
that
stuff
said
berryman
as
might
have
been
expected
this
celebrated
novel
name
had
galvanised
him
into
life
he
strolled
over
to
the
bookcase
took
down
a
book
opened
it
and
began
to
read
wandering
in
a
desultory
way
about
the
room
ha
berryman
said
a
conciliatory
voice
behind
it
came
from
trimmer
who
had
set
his
back
against
the
hearth
and
grasped
with
either
hand
a
fistful
of
his
gown
the
book
a
classic
classic
exclaimed
berryman
transfixing
shelton
with
his
eyes
the
fellow
ought
to
have
been
horsewhipped
for
writing
such
putridity
a
feeling
of
hostility
instantly
sprang
up
in
shelton
he
looked
at
his
little
host
who
however
merely
blinked
berryman
only
means
explains
washer
a
certain
malice
in
his
smile
that
the
author
is
one
of
his
particular
for
god
sake
you
know
do
get
berryman
on
his
horse
growled
the
little
fat
man
suddenly
berryman
returned
his
volume
to
the
shelf
and
took
another
down
there
was
something
almost
godlike
in
his
sarcastic
imagine
a
man
writing
that
stuff
he
said
if
he
ever
been
at
eton
what
do
we
want
to
know
about
that
sort
of
thing
a
writer
should
be
a
sportsman
and
a
gentleman
and
again
he
looked
down
over
his
chin
at
shelton
as
though
expecting
him
to
controvert
the
sentiment
do
you
began
the
latter
but
berryman
attention
had
wandered
to
the
wall
i
really
do
care
said
he
to
know
what
a
woman
feels
when
she
is
going
to
the
dogs
it
does
interest
the
voice
of
trimmer
made
things
pleasant
question
of
moral
standards
that
and
nothing
he
had
stretched
his
legs
like
compasses
and
the
way
he
grasped
his
seemed
to
turn
him
to
a
pair
of
scales
his
lowering
smile
embraced
the
room
deprecating
strong
expressions
after
all
he
seemed
to
say
we
are
men
of
the
world
we
know
there
not
very
much
in
anything
this
is
the
modern
spirit
why
not
give
it
a
look
in
do
i
understand
you
to
say
berryman
that
you
do
enjoy
a
spicy
book
asked
washer
with
his
smile
and
at
this
question
the
little
fat
man
sniggered
blinking
tempestuously
as
if
to
say
nothing
pleasanter
do
you
know
before
a
hot
fire
in
cold
berryman
paid
no
attention
to
the
impertinent
inquiry
continuing
to
dip
into
his
volume
and
walk
up
and
down
i
nothing
to
say
he
remarked
stopping
before
shelton
and
looking
down
as
if
at
last
aware
of
him
to
those
who
talk
of
being
justified
through
art
i
call
a
spade
a
shelton
did
not
answer
because
he
could
not
tell
whether
berryman
was
addressing
him
or
society
at
large
and
berryman
went
on
do
we
want
to
know
about
the
feelings
of
a
woman
with
a
taste
for
vice
tell
me
the
point
of
it
no
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
taking
baths
would
choose
such
a
you
come
to
the
question
the
voice
of
trimmer
genially
buzzed
he
had
gathered
his
garments
tight
across
his
back
my
dear
fellow
art
properly
applied
justifies
all
for
art
squeaked
berryman
putting
back
his
second
volume
and
taking
down
a
third
you
have
homer
cervantes
shakespeare
ossian
for
garbage
a
number
of
unwashed
there
was
a
laugh
shelton
glanced
round
at
all
in
turn
with
the
exception
of
crocker
who
was
half
asleep
and
smiling
idiotically
they
wore
one
and
all
a
look
as
if
by
no
chance
could
they
consider
any
subject
fit
to
move
their
hearts
as
if
one
and
all
they
were
so
profoundly
anchored
on
the
sea
of
life
that
waves
could
only
seem
impertinent
it
may
have
been
some
glimmer
in
this
glance
of
that
brought
trimmer
once
more
to
the
rescue
with
his
compromising
air
the
french
said
he
have
quite
a
different
standard
from
ourselves
in
literature
just
as
they
have
a
different
standard
in
regard
to
honour
all
this
is
purely
what
he
meant
however
shelton
found
it
difficult
to
tell
honour
said
washer
die
ehre
duelling
unfaithful
wives
he
was
clearly
going
to
add
to
this
but
it
was
lost
for
the
little
fat
man
taking
the
meerschaum
with
trembling
fingers
and
holding
it
within
two
inches
of
his
chin
murmured
you
fellows
berryman
strong
on
he
blinked
twice
and
put
the
meerschaum
back
between
his
lips
without
returning
the
third
volume
to
its
shelf
berryman
took
down
a
fourth
with
chest
expanded
he
appeared
about
to
use
the
books
as
quite
so
said
trimmer
the
change
from
duelling
to
law
courts
is
profoundly
whether
he
were
going
to
say
significant
or
insignificant
in
shelton
estimate
he
did
not
know
himself
fortunately
berryman
broke
in
law
courts
or
not
when
a
man
runs
away
with
a
wife
of
mine
i
shall
punch
his
head
come
come
said
turner
spasmodically
grasping
his
two
wings
shelton
had
a
gleam
of
inspiration
if
your
wife
deceived
you
he
thought
looking
at
trimmer
eyes
you
keep
it
quiet
and
hold
it
over
washer
passed
his
hand
over
his
pale
chaps
his
smile
had
never
wavered
he
looked
like
one
for
ever
lost
in
the
making
of
an
epigram
the
punching
theorist
stretched
his
body
holding
the
books
level
with
his
shoulders
as
though
to
stone
his
hearers
with
his
point
of
view
his
face
grew
paler
his
fine
eyes
finer
his
lips
ironical
almost
painful
was
this
combination
of
the
strong
man
and
the
student
who
was
bound
to
go
to
pieces
if
you
hit
him
a
smart
blow
as
for
forgiving
faithless
wives
he
said
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
do
believe
in
the
words
were
and
sarcastic
shelton
looked
hastily
around
all
their
faces
were
complacent
he
grew
red
and
suddenly
remarked
in
a
soft
clear
voice
i
see
he
was
conscious
that
he
had
never
before
made
an
impression
of
this
sort
and
that
he
never
would
again
the
cold
hostility
flashing
out
all
round
was
most
enlightening
it
instantly
gave
way
to
the
polite
satirical
indulgence
peculiar
to
men
crocker
rose
nervously
he
seemed
scared
and
was
obviously
relieved
when
shelton
following
his
example
grasped
the
little
fat
man
hand
who
said
in
a
voice
shaken
by
tobacco
who
are
your
unshaven
friends
he
heard
as
the
door
was
closed
behind
them
chapter
xix
an
incident
eleven
said
crocker
as
they
went
out
of
college
i
feel
sleepy
shall
we
stroll
along
the
a
bit
shelton
assented
he
was
too
busy
thinking
of
his
encounter
with
the
dons
to
heed
the
soreness
of
his
feet
this
too
was
the
last
day
of
his
travels
for
he
had
not
altered
his
intention
of
waiting
at
oxford
till
july
we
call
this
place
the
heart
of
knowledge
he
said
passing
a
great
building
that
presided
white
and
silent
over
darkness
it
seems
to
me
as
little
that
as
society
is
the
heart
of
true
crocker
answer
was
a
grunt
he
was
looking
at
the
stars
calculating
possibly
in
how
long
he
could
walk
to
heaven
no
proceeded
shelton
we
too
much
up
here
to
strain
our
minds
we
know
when
it
time
to
stop
we
pile
up
news
of
papias
and
all
the
verbs
in
but
as
for
news
of
life
or
of
oneself
real
seekers
after
knowledge
are
a
different
sort
they
fight
in
the
dark
no
quarter
given
we
do
grow
that
sort
up
how
jolly
the
limes
smell
said
crocker
he
had
halted
opposite
a
garden
and
taken
hold
of
shelton
by
a
button
of
his
coat
his
eyes
like
a
dog
stared
wistfully
it
seemed
as
though
he
wished
to
speak
but
feared
to
give
offence
they
tell
you
pursued
shelton
that
we
learn
to
be
gentlemen
up
here
we
learn
that
better
through
one
incident
that
stirs
our
hearts
than
we
learn
it
here
in
all
the
time
we
hum
muttered
crocker
twisting
at
the
button
those
fellows
who
seemed
the
best
sorts
up
here
have
turned
out
the
best
sorts
i
hope
not
said
shelton
gloomily
i
was
a
snob
when
i
was
up
here
i
believed
all
i
was
told
anything
that
made
things
pleasant
my
were
nothing
but
crocker
smiled
in
the
darkness
he
had
been
too
cranky
to
belong
to
shelton
you
never
were
much
like
your
old
chap
he
said
shelton
turned
away
sniffing
the
perfume
of
the
limes
images
were
thronging
through
his
mind
the
faces
of
his
old
friends
strangely
mixed
with
those
of
people
he
had
lately
met
the
girl
in
the
train
ferrand
the
lady
with
the
short
round
powdered
face
the
little
barber
others
too
and
floating
mysterious
connected
with
them
all
antonia
face
the
scent
of
the
drifted
at
him
with
its
magic
sweetness
from
the
street
behind
the
footsteps
of
the
sounded
muffled
yet
exact
and
on
the
breeze
was
borne
the
strain
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
he
a
jolly
good
fellow
for
he
a
jolly
good
and
so
say
all
of
us
ah
he
said
they
were
good
i
used
to
think
said
crocker
dreamily
that
some
of
them
had
too
much
and
shelton
laughed
the
thing
sickens
me
said
he
the
whole
snobbish
selfish
business
the
place
sickens
me
lined
with
so
beastly
crocker
shook
his
head
it
a
splendid
old
place
he
said
his
eyes
fastening
at
last
on
shelton
boots
you
know
old
chap
he
stammered
i
think
you
you
ought
to
take
care
take
care
what
of
crocker
pressed
his
arm
convulsively
do
be
waxy
old
boy
he
said
i
mean
that
you
seem
somehow
to
be
to
be
losing
losing
myself
finding
myself
you
mean
crocker
did
not
answer
his
face
was
disappointed
of
what
exactly
was
he
thinking
in
shelton
heart
there
was
a
bitter
pleasure
in
knowing
that
his
friend
was
uncomfortable
on
his
account
a
sort
of
contempt
a
sort
of
aching
crocker
broke
the
silence
i
think
i
shall
do
a
bit
more
walking
he
said
i
feel
very
fit
do
you
really
mean
to
come
any
further
with
me
bird
and
there
was
anxiety
in
his
voice
as
though
shelton
were
in
danger
of
missing
something
good
the
latter
feet
had
instantly
begun
to
ache
and
burn
no
he
said
you
know
what
i
staying
here
crocker
nodded
she
lives
near
here
well
then
i
say
i
should
like
to
do
another
ten
miles
my
dear
fellow
you
tired
and
crocker
chuckled
no
he
said
i
want
to
get
on
see
you
in
london
and
gripping
shelton
hand
he
turned
and
limped
away
shelton
called
after
him
do
be
an
idiot
you
only
knock
yourself
but
the
sole
answer
was
the
pale
moon
of
crocker
face
screwed
round
towards
him
in
the
darkness
and
the
waving
of
his
stick
shelton
strolled
slowly
on
leaning
over
the
bridge
he
watched
the
oily
gleam
of
lamps
on
the
dark
water
underneath
the
trees
he
felt
relieved
yet
sorry
his
thoughts
were
random
curious
half
mutinous
half
sweet
that
afternoon
five
years
ago
when
he
had
walked
back
from
the
river
with
antonia
across
the
christchurch
meadows
was
vivid
to
his
mind
the
scent
of
that
afternoon
had
never
died
away
from
aroma
of
his
love
soon
she
would
be
his
wife
his
wife
the
faces
of
the
dons
sprang
up
before
him
they
had
wives
perhaps
fat
lean
satirical
and
compromising
what
was
it
that
through
diversity
they
had
in
common
cultured
intolerance
honour
a
queer
subject
to
discuss
honour
the
honour
that
made
a
fuss
and
claimed
its
rights
and
shelton
smiled
as
if
man
honour
suffered
when
he
injured
and
slowly
he
walked
along
the
echoing
empty
street
to
his
room
at
the
bishop
head
next
morning
he
received
the
following
wire
thirty
miles
left
eighteen
hours
heel
bad
but
going
strong
crocker
he
passed
a
fortnight
at
the
bishop
head
waiting
for
the
end
of
his
probation
and
the
end
seemed
long
in
coming
to
be
so
near
antonia
and
as
far
as
if
he
lived
upon
another
planet
was
worse
than
ever
each
day
he
took
a
sculling
skiff
and
pulled
down
to
near
holm
oaks
on
the
chance
of
her
being
on
the
river
but
the
house
was
two
miles
off
and
the
chance
but
slender
she
never
came
after
spending
the
afternoons
like
this
he
would
return
pulling
hard
against
the
stream
with
a
queer
feeling
of
relief
dine
heartily
and
fall
over
his
cigar
each
morning
he
awoke
in
an
excited
mood
devoured
his
letter
if
he
had
one
and
sat
down
to
write
to
her
these
letters
of
his
were
the
most
amazing
portion
of
that
fortnight
they
were
remarkable
for
failing
to
express
any
single
one
of
his
real
thoughts
but
they
were
full
of
sentiments
which
were
not
what
he
was
truly
feeling
and
when
he
set
himself
to
analyse
he
had
such
moments
of
delirium
that
he
was
scared
and
shocked
and
quite
unable
to
write
anything
he
made
the
discovery
that
no
two
human
beings
ever
tell
each
other
what
they
really
feel
except
perhaps
in
situations
with
which
he
could
not
connect
eyes
and
brilliant
smile
all
the
world
was
too
engaged
in
planning
decency
absorbed
by
longings
he
but
vaguely
realised
the
turmoil
of
commemoration
which
had
gathered
its
hundreds
for
their
annual
cure
of
salmon
mayonnaise
and
cheap
champagne
in
preparation
for
his
visit
to
holm
oaks
he
shaved
his
beard
and
had
some
clothes
sent
down
from
london
with
them
was
forwarded
a
letter
from
ferrand
which
ran
as
follows
imperial
peacock
hotel
folkestone
june
my
dear
sir
forgive
me
for
not
having
written
to
you
before
but
i
have
been
so
bothered
that
i
have
felt
no
taste
for
writing
when
i
have
the
time
i
have
some
curious
stories
to
tell
you
once
again
i
have
encountered
that
demon
of
misfortune
which
dogs
my
footsteps
being
occupied
all
day
and
nearly
all
night
upon
business
which
brings
me
a
heap
of
worries
and
next
to
no
profit
i
have
no
chance
to
look
after
my
things
thieves
have
entered
my
room
stolen
everything
and
left
me
an
empty
box
i
am
once
again
almost
without
clothes
and
know
not
where
to
turn
to
make
that
figure
necessary
for
the
fulfilment
of
my
duties
you
see
i
am
not
lucky
since
coming
to
your
country
the
sole
piece
of
fortune
i
have
had
was
to
tumble
on
a
man
like
you
excuse
me
for
not
writing
more
at
this
moment
hoping
that
you
are
in
good
health
and
in
affectionately
pressing
your
hand
i
am
always
your
devoted
louis
ferrand
upon
reading
this
letter
shelton
had
once
more
a
sense
of
being
exploited
of
which
he
was
ashamed
he
sat
down
immediately
and
wrote
the
following
reply
bishops
head
hotel
oxford
june
my
dear
ferrand
i
am
grieved
to
hear
of
your
misfortunes
i
was
much
hoping
that
you
had
made
a
better
start
i
enclose
you
post
office
orders
for
four
pounds
always
glad
to
hear
from
you
yours
sincerely
richard
shelton
he
posted
it
with
the
satisfaction
that
a
man
feels
who
nobly
shakes
off
his
responsibilities
three
days
before
july
he
met
with
one
of
those
disturbing
incidents
which
befall
no
persons
who
attend
quietly
to
their
property
and
reputation
the
night
was
unbearably
hot
and
he
had
wandered
out
with
his
cigar
a
woman
came
sidling
up
and
spoke
to
him
he
perceived
her
to
be
one
of
those
made
by
men
into
mediums
for
their
pleasure
to
feel
sympathy
with
whom
was
sentimental
her
face
was
flushed
her
whisper
hoarse
she
had
no
attractions
but
the
curves
of
a
tawdry
figure
shelton
was
repelled
by
her
proprietary
tone
by
her
blowzy
face
and
by
the
scent
of
patchouli
her
touch
on
his
arm
startled
him
sending
a
shiver
through
his
marrow
he
almost
leaped
aside
and
walked
the
faster
but
her
breathing
as
she
followed
sounded
laboured
it
suddenly
seemed
pitiful
that
a
woman
should
be
panting
after
him
like
that
the
least
i
can
do
he
thought
is
to
speak
to
he
stopped
and
with
a
mixture
of
hardness
and
compassion
said
it
in
spite
of
her
smile
he
saw
by
her
disappointed
eyes
that
she
accepted
the
impossibility
i
sorry
he
said
she
muttered
something
shelton
shook
his
head
i
sorry
he
said
once
more
the
woman
bit
her
lower
lip
she
answered
dully
at
the
corner
of
the
street
he
turned
his
head
the
woman
was
hurrying
uneasily
a
policeman
coming
from
behind
had
caught
her
by
the
arm
his
heart
began
to
beat
heavens
he
thought
what
shall
i
do
now
his
first
impulse
was
to
walk
away
and
think
no
more
about
it
to
act
indeed
like
any
averagely
decent
man
who
did
not
care
to
be
concerned
in
such
affairs
he
retraced
his
steps
however
and
halted
half
a
dozen
paces
from
their
figures
ask
the
gentleman
he
spoke
to
me
she
was
saying
in
her
brassy
voice
through
the
emphasis
of
which
shelton
could
detect
her
fear
that
all
right
returned
the
policeman
we
know
all
about
you
police
cried
the
woman
tearfully
i
got
to
get
my
living
have
i
the
same
as
you
shelton
hesitated
then
catching
the
expression
in
her
frightened
face
stepped
forward
the
policeman
turned
and
at
the
sight
of
his
pale
heavy
jowl
cut
by
the
and
the
bullying
eyes
he
felt
both
hate
and
fear
as
if
brought
face
to
face
with
all
that
he
despised
and
loathed
yet
strangely
dreaded
the
cold
certainty
of
law
and
order
upholding
the
strong
treading
underfoot
the
weak
the
smug
front
of
meanness
that
only
the
purest
spirits
may
attack
seemed
to
be
facing
him
and
the
odd
thing
was
this
man
was
only
carrying
out
his
duty
shelton
moistened
his
lips
you
not
going
to
charge
her
are
i
returned
the
policeman
look
here
constable
you
making
a
the
policeman
took
out
his
oh
i
making
a
mistake
i
take
your
name
and
address
please
we
have
to
report
these
by
all
means
said
shelton
angrily
giving
it
i
spoke
to
her
perhaps
you
come
up
to
the
court
tomorrow
morning
and
repeat
that
replied
the
policeman
with
incivility
shelton
looked
at
him
with
all
the
force
at
his
command
you
had
better
be
careful
constable
he
said
but
in
the
act
of
uttering
these
words
he
thought
how
pitiable
they
sounded
we
not
to
be
trifled
with
returned
the
policeman
in
a
threatening
voice
shelton
could
think
of
nothing
but
to
repeat
you
had
better
be
careful
you
a
gentleman
replied
the
policeman
i
only
a
policeman
you
got
the
riches
i
got
the
grasping
the
woman
arm
he
began
to
move
along
with
her
shelton
turned
and
walked
away
he
went
to
grinnings
club
and
flung
himself
down
upon
a
sofa
his
feeling
was
not
one
of
pity
for
the
woman
nor
of
peculiar
anger
with
the
policeman
but
rather
of
dissatisfaction
with
himself
what
ought
i
to
have
done
he
thought
the
beggar
was
within
his
he
stared
at
the
pictures
on
the
wall
and
a
tide
of
disgust
surged
up
in
him
one
or
other
of
us
he
reflected
we
make
these
women
what
they
are
and
when
we
made
them
we
ca
do
without
them
we
do
want
to
but
we
give
them
no
proper
homes
so
that
they
reduced
to
prowl
about
the
streets
and
then
we
run
them
in

that
good
that
excellent
we
run
them
in
and
here
we
sit
and
carp
but
what
do
we
do
nothing
our
system
is
the
most
highly
moral

we
get
the

soiling

he
lit
a
cigarette
and
ordered
the
waiter
to
bring
a
drink
i
go
to
the
court
he
thought
but
suddenly
it
occurred
to
him
that
the
case
would
get
into
the
local
papers
the
press
would
never
miss
so
nice
a
little
bit
of
scandal
gentleman
policeman
and
he
had
a
vision
of
antonia
father
a
neighbouring
and
conscientious
magistrate
solemnly
reading
this
someone
at
all
events
was
bound
to
see
his
name
and
make
a
point
of
mentioning
it
too
good
to
be
missed
and
suddenly
he
saw
with
horror
that
to
help
the
woman
he
would
have
to
assert
again
that
he
had
spoken
to
her
first
i
must
go
to
the
court
he
kept
thinking
as
if
to
assure
himself
that
he
was
not
a
coward
he
lay
awake
half
the
night
worrying
over
this
dilemma
but
i
did
speak
to
her
first
he
told
himself
i
shall
only
be
telling
a
lie
and
they
make
me
swear
it
too
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
this
was
against
his
principles
but
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
knew
that
he
would
not
object
to
telling
such
a
lie
if
only
guaranteed
immune
from
consequences
it
appeared
to
him
indeed
but
obvious
humanity
but
why
should
i
suffer
he
thought
i
done
nothing
it
neither
reasonable
nor
he
hated
the
unhappy
woman
who
was
causing
him
these
horrors
of
uncertainty
whenever
he
decided
one
way
or
other
the
policeman
face
with
its
tyrannical
and
muddy
eyes
rose
before
him
like
a
nightmare
and
forced
him
to
an
opposite
conviction
he
fell
asleep
at
last
with
the
full
determination
to
go
and
see
what
happened
he
woke
with
a
sense
of
odd
disturbance
i
can
do
no
good
by
going
he
thought
remembering
aid
lying
very
still
they
certain
to
believe
the
policeman
i
shall
only
blacken
myself
for
nothing
and
the
combat
began
again
within
him
but
with
far
less
fury
it
was
not
what
other
people
thought
not
even
the
risk
of
perjury
that
mattered
all
this
he
made
quite
clear
it
was
antonia
it
was
not
fair
to
her
to
put
himself
in
such
a
false
position
in
fact
not
decent
he
breakfasted
in
the
room
were
some
americans
and
the
face
of
one
young
girl
reminded
him
a
little
of
antonia
fainter
and
fainter
grew
the
incident
it
seemed
to
have
its
right
proportions
two
hours
later
looking
at
the
clock
he
found
that
it
was
he
had
not
gone
had
not
committed
perjury
but
he
wrote
to
a
daily
paper
pointing
out
the
danger
run
by
the
community
from
the
power
which
a
belief
in
their
infallibility
places
in
the
hands
of
the
police
how
since
they
are
the
sworn
abettors
of
right
and
justice
their
word
is
almost
necessarily
taken
to
be
gospel
how
one
and
all
they
hang
together
from
mingled
interest
and
esprit
de
corps
was
it
not
he
said
reasonable
to
suppose
that
amongst
thousands
of
human
beings
invested
with
such
opportunities
there
would
be
found
bullies
who
would
take
advantage
of
them
and
rise
to
distinction
in
the
service
upon
the
helplessness
of
the
unfortunate
and
the
cowardice
of
people
with
anything
to
lose
those
who
had
in
their
hands
the
sacred
duties
of
selecting
a
practically
irresponsible
body
of
men
were
bound
for
the
sake
of
freedom
and
humanity
to
exercise
those
duties
with
the
utmost
care
and
thoroughness
however
true
none
of
this
helped
him
to
think
any
better
of
himself
at
heart
and
he
was
haunted
by
the
feeling
that
a
stout
and
honest
bit
of
perjury
was
worth
more
than
a
letter
to
a
daily
paper
he
never
saw
his
letter
printed
containing
as
it
did
the
germs
of
an
unpalatable
truth
in
the
afternoon
he
hired
a
horse
and
galloped
on
port
meadow
the
strain
of
his
indecision
over
he
felt
like
a
man
recovering
from
an
illness
and
he
carefully
abstained
from
looking
at
the
local
papers
there
was
that
within
him
however
which
resented
the
worsting
of
his
chivalry

its

burned

walked
up

rang
the
bell

at

he
asked
of
the
grave
butler
who
old

that
he
was
still
wore
coloured
trousers
for
it
was

and
he
regarded
coloured
trousers
up
to
noon
as
a
sacred
distinction
between
the
footmen
and
himself
mrs
dennant
replied
this
personage
raising
his
round
and
hairless
face
while
on
his
mouth
appeared
that
apologetic
pout
which
comes
of
living
with
good

in

crossed
the
panelled
hall
through
whose
far
side
the
lawn
was
visible
a
vision
of
serenity
he
mounted
six
wide
shallow
steps
and
stopped
from
behind
a
closed
door
there
came
the
sound
of
scales
and
he
stood
a
prey
to
his
emotions
the
notes
mingling
in
his
ears
with
the
beating
of
his
heart
he
softly
turned
the
handle
a
fixed
smile
on
his
lips
antonia
was
at
the
piano
her
head
was
bobbing
to
the
movements
of
her
fingers
and
pressing
down
the
pedals
were
her
slim
monotonously
moving
feet
she
had
been
playing
tennis
for
a
racquet
and
her
were
flung
down
and
she
was
dressed
in
a
blue
skirt
and
creamy
blouse
fitting
collarless
about
her
throat
her
face
was
flushed
and
wore
a
little
frown
and
as
her
fingers
raced
along
the
keys
her
neck
swayed
and
the
silk
clung
and
shivered
on
her
arms
shelton
eyes
fastened
on
the
silent
counting
lips
on
the
fair
hair
about
her
forehead
the
darker
eyebrows
slanting
down
towards
the
nose
the
undimpled
cheeks
with
the
faint
beneath
the
eyes
the
and
undimpled
chin
the
whole
remote
sweet
suntouched
glacial
face
she
turned
her
head
and
springing
up
cried
dick
what
fun
she
gave
him
both
her
hands
but
her
smiling
face
said
very
plainly
oh
do
let
us
be
sentimental
are
you
glad
to
see
me
muttered
shelton
glad
to
see
you
you
are
funny
dick
as
if
you
did
know
why
you
shaved
your
beard
mother
and
sybil
have
gone
into
the
village
to
see
old
hopkins
shall
we
go
out
thea
and
the
boys
are
playing
tennis
it
so
jolly
that
you
come
she
caught
up
the
and
pinned
it
to
her
hair
almost
as
tall
as
shelton
she
looked
taller
with
arms
raised
and
loose
sleeves
quivering
like
wings
to
the
movements
of
her
fingers
we
might
have
a
game
before
lunch
you
can
have
my
other
i
got
no
things
said
shelton
blankly
her
calm
glance
ran
over
him
you
can
have
some
of
old
bernard
he
got
any
amount
i
wait
for
she
swung
her
racquet
looked
at
shelton
cried
be
quick
and
vanished
shelton
ran
and
dressed
in
the
undecided
way
of
men
assuming
other
people
clothes
she
was
in
the
hall
when
he
descended
humming
a
tune
and
prodding
at
her
shoe
her
smile
showed
all
her
pearly
upper
teeth
he
caught
hold
of
her
sleeve
and
whispered
antonia
the
colour
rushed
into
her
cheeks
she
looked
back
across
her
shoulder
come
along
old
dick
she
cried
and
flinging
open
the
glass
door
ran
into
the
garden
shelton
followed
the
was
divided
by
tall
netting
from
a
paddock
a
holm
oak
tree
shaded
one
corner
and
its
thick
dark
foliage
gave
an
unexpected
depth
to
the
green
smoothness
of
the
scene
as
shelton
and
antonia
came
up
bernard
dennant
stopped
and
cordially
grasped
shelton
hand
from
the
far
side
of
the
net
thea
in
a
shortish
skirt
tossed
back
her
straight
fair
hair
and
warding
off
the
sun
came
strolling
up
to
them
the
umpire
a
small
boy
of
twelve
was
lying
on
his
stomach
squealing
and
tickling
a
collie
shelton
bent
and
pulled
his
hair
hallo
toddles
you
young
ruffian
one
and
all
they
stood
round
shelton
and
there
was
a
frank
and
pitiless
inquiry
in
their
eyes
in
the
angle
of
their
noses
something
chaffing
and
distrustful
as
though
about
him
were
some
subtle
poignant
scent
exciting
curiosity
and
disapproval
when
the
setts
were
over
and
the
girls
resting
in
the
double
hammock
underneath
the
holm
oak
shelton
went
with
bernard
to
the
paddock
to
hunt
for
the
lost
balls
i
say
old
chap
said
his
old
smiling
dryly
you
in
for
a
wigging
from
the
a
wigging
murmured
shelton
i
do
know
much
about
it
but
from
something
she
let
drop
it
seems
you
been
saying
some
queer
things
in
your
letters
to
antonia
and
again
he
looked
at
shelton
with
his
dry
smile
queer
things
said
the
latter
angrily
what
d
you
mean
oh
do
ask
me
the
mater
thinks
she
in
a
bad
way
unsettled
or
what
d
you
call
at
you
been
telling
her
that
things
are
not
what
they
seem
that
bad
you
know
and
still
smiling
he
shook
his
head
shelton
dropped
his
eyes
well
they
are
he
said
oh
that
all
right
but
do
bring
your
philosophy
down
here
old
philosophy
said
shelton
puzzled
leave
us
a
sacred
prejudice
or
sacred
nothing
sacred
except
but
shelton
did
not
finish
his
remark
i
do
understand
he
said
ideals
that
sort
of
thing
you
been
diving
down
below
the
line
of
politics
that
about
the
size
of
it
my
boy
and
stooping
suddenly
he
picked
up
the
last
ball
there
is
the
mater
shelton
saw
dennant
coming
down
the
lawn
with
her
second
daughter
sybil
by
the
time
they
reached
the
holm
oak
the
three
girls
had
departed
towards
the
house
walking
arm
in
arm
and
dennant
was
standing
there
alone
in
a
grey
dress
talking
to
an
undergardener
her
hands
cased
in
tan
gauntlets
held
a
basket
which
warded
off
the
bearded
gardener
from
the
severe
but
ample
lines
of
her
skirt
the
collie
erect
upon
his
haunches
looked
at
their
two
faces
pricking
his
ears
in
his
endeavour
to
appreciate
how
one
of
these
two
bipeds
differed
from
the
other
thank
you
that
do
bunyan
ah
dick
charmin
to
see
you
here
at
last
in
his
intercourse
with
dennant
shelton
never
failed
to
mark
the
typical
nature
of
her
personality
it
always
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
met
so
many
other
ladies
like
her
he
felt
that
her
undoubtable
quality
had
a
flavour
as
if
standing
for
her
class
she
thought
that
standing
for
herself
was
not
the
thing
yet
she
was
full
of
character
tall
with
nose
a
trifle
beaked
long
sloping
chin
and
an
assured
benevolent
mouth
showing
perhaps
too
many
teeth
though
thin
she
was
not
unsubstantial
her
accent
in
speaking
showed
her
heritage
it
was
a
kind
of
drawl
which
disregarded
vulgar
merits
such
as
tone
leaned
on
some
syllables
and
despised
the
final
the
peculiar
accent
in
fact
of
aristocracy
adding
its
deliberate
joys
to
life
shelton
knew
that
she
had
many
interests
she
was
never
really
idle
from
the
time
when
her
maid
brought
her
a
little
china
pot
of
tea
with
a
single
biscuit
and
her
pet
dog
tops
till
eleven
at
night
when
she
lighted
a
wax
candle
in
a
silver
candlestick
and
with
this
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
new
novel
or
better
still
one
of
those
charming
volumes
written
by
great
people
about
the
still
greater
people
they
have
met
she
said
to
her
children
and
her
guests
no
what
with
photography
the
presidency
of
a
local
league
visiting
the
rich
superintending
all
the
poor
gardening
reading
keeping
all
her
ideas
so
tidy
that
no
foreign
notions
might
stray
in
she
was
never
idle
the
information
she
collected
from
these
sources
was
both
vast
and
varied
but
she
never
let
it
flavour
her
opinions
which
lacked
sauce
and
were
drawn
from
some
sort
of
dish
into
which
with
all
her
class
she
dipped
her
fingers
he
liked
her
no
one
could
help
liking
her
she
was
kind
and
of
such
good
quality
with
a
suggestion
about
her
of
thin
excellent
and
useful
china
and
she
was
scented
too
not
with
verbena
violets
or
those
essences
which
women
love
but
with
nothing
as
if
she
had
taken
stand
against
all
meretricity
in
her
intercourse
with
persons
not
quite
the
thing
she
excepted
the
vicar
from
this
category
though
his
father
had
dealt
in
haberdashery
her
refinement
gently
unobtrusively
and
with
great
practical
good
sense
seemed
continually
to
murmur
i
am
and
you
well
are
you
do
you
know
but
there
was
no
about
this
attitude
for
she
was
really
not
a
common
woman
she
simply
could
not
help
it
all
her
people
had
done
this
their
nurses
breathed
above
them
in
their
cradles
something
that
inhaled
into
their
systems
ever
afterwards
prevented
them
from
taking
good
clear
breaths
and
her
manner
ah
her
manner
it
concealed
the
inner
woman
so
as
to
leave
doubt
of
her
existence
shelton
listened
to
the
kindly
briskness
with
which
she
dwelt
upon
the
poor
bunyan
he
lost
his
wife
six
months
ago
and
was
quite
cheerful
just
at
first
but
now
he
really
too
distressin
i
done
all
i
can
to
rouse
him
it
so
melancholy
to
see
him
mopin
and
my
dear
dick
the
way
he
mangles
the
new
i
afraid
he
goin
mad
i
shall
have
to
send
him
away
poor
fellow
it
was
clear
that
she
sympathised
with
bunyan
or
rather
believed
him
entitled
to
a
modicum
of
wholesome
grief
the
loss
of
wives
being
a
canonised
and
legal
sorrow
but
excesses
o
dear
no
i
told
him
i
shall
raise
his
wages
she
sighed
he
used
to
be
such
a
splendid
gardener
that
reminds
me
my
dear
dick
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
you
shall
we
go
in
to
lunch
consulting
the
in
which
she
had
been
noting
the
case
of
hopkins
she
slightly
preceded
shelton
to
the
house
it
was
somewhat
late
that
afternoon
when
shelton
had
his
wigging
nor
did
it
seem
to
him
hypnotised
by
the
momentary
absence
of
antonia
such
a
very
serious
affair
now
dick
the
honourable
dennant
said
in
her
decisive
drawl
i
do
think
it
right
to
put
ideas
into
antonia
ideas
murmured
shelton
in
confusion
we
all
know
continued
dennant
that
things
are
not
always
what
they
ought
to
shelton
looked
at
her
she
was
seated
at
her
addressing
in
her
large
free
writing
a
dinner
invitation
to
a
bishop
there
was
not
the
faintest
trace
of
awkwardness
about
her
yet
shelton
could
not
help
a
certain
sense
of
shock
if
she
she
did
not
think
things
were
what
they
ought
to
be
in
a
bad
way
things
must
be
indeed
things
he
muttered
dennant
looked
at
him
firmly
but
kindly
with
the
eyes
that
would
remind
him
of
a
hare
she
showed
me
some
of
your
letters
you
know
well
it
not
a
bit
of
use
denyin
my
dear
dick
that
you
been
thinkin
too
much
shelton
perceived
that
he
had
done
her
an
injustice
she
handled
things
as
she
handled
put
them
away
when
they
showed
signs
of
running
to
extremes
i
ca
help
that
i
afraid
he
answered
my
dear
boy
you
never
get
on
that
way
now
i
want
you
to
promise
me
you
wo
talk
to
antonia
about
those
sort
of
shelton
raised
his
eyebrows
oh
you
know
what
i
mean
he
saw
that
to
press
dennant
to
say
what
she
meant
by
things
would
really
hurt
her
sense
of
form
it
would
be
cruel
to
force
her
thus
below
the
surface
he
therefore
said
quite
so
to
his
extreme
surprise
flushing
the
peculiar
and
pathetic
flush
of
women
past
their
prime
she
drawled
out
about
the
poor
and
criminals
and
marriages
there
was
that
wedding
do
you
know
shelton
bowed
his
head
motherhood
had
been
too
strong
for
her
in
her
maternal
flutter
she
had
committed
the
solecism
of
touching
in
so
many
words
on
does
she
really
see
the
fun
he
thought
in
one
man
dining
out
of
gold
and
another
dining
in
the
gutter
or
in
two
married
people
living
on
together
in
perfect
discord
encourages
les
autres
or
in
worshipping
jesus
christ
and
claiming
all
her
rights
at
the
same
time
or
in
despising
foreigners
because
they
are
foreigners
or
in
war
or
in
anything
that
is
funny
but
he
did
her
a
certain
amount
of
justice
by
recognising
that
this
was
natural
since
her
whole
life
had
been
passed
in
trying
not
to
see
the
fun
in
all
these
things
but
antonia
stood
smiling
in
the
doorway
brilliant
and
gay
she
looked
yet
resentful
as
if
she
knew
they
had
been
talking
of
her
she
sat
down
by
shelton
side
and
began
asking
him
about
the
youthful
foreigner
whom
he
had
spoken
of
and
her
eyes
made
him
doubt
whether
she
too
saw
the
fun
that
lay
in
one
human
being
patronising
others
but
i
suppose
he
really
good
she
said
i
mean
all
those
things
he
told
you
about
were
only
good
he
answered
fidgeting
i
do
really
know
what
the
word
her
eyes
clouded
dick
how
can
you
they
seemed
to
say
shelton
stroked
her
sleeve
tell
us
about
crocker
she
said
taking
no
heed
of
his
caress
the
lunatic
he
said
lunatic
why
in
your
letters
he
was
so
he
is
said
shelton
half
ashamed
he
not
a
bit
mad
really
that
is
i
only
wish
i
were
half
as
who
that
mad
queried
dennant
from
behind
the
urn
tom
crocker
ah
yes
i
knew
his
mother
she
was
a
did
he
do
it
in
the
week
said
thea
appearing
in
the
window
with
a
kitten
i
do
know
shelton
was
obliged
to
answer
thea
shook
back
her
hair
i
call
it
awfully
slack
of
you
not
to
have
found
out
she
said
antonia
frowned
you
were
very
sweet
to
that
young
foreigner
dick
she
murmured
with
a
smile
at
shelton
i
wish
that
we
could
see
but
shelton
shook
his
head
it
seems
to
me
he
muttered
that
i
did
about
as
little
for
him
as
i
again
her
face
grew
thoughtful
as
though
his
words
had
chilled
her
i
do
see
what
more
you
could
have
done
she
answered
a
desire
to
get
close
to
her
half
fear
half
ache
a
sense
of
futility
and
bafflement
an
inner
burning
made
him
feel
as
though
a
flame
were
licking
at
his
heart
chapter
xxi
english
just
as
shelton
was
starting
to
walk
back
to
oxford
he
met
dennant
coming
from
a
ride
antonia
father
was
a
spare
man
of
medium
height
with
yellowish
face
grey
moustache
ironical
eyebrows
and
some
tiny
in
his
old
short
grey
coat
with
a
little
slit
up
the
middle
of
the
back
his
drab
cord
breeches
ancient
mahogany
leggings
and
carefully
blacked
boats
he
had
a
dry
threadbare
quality
not
without
distinction
ah
shelton
he
said
in
his
quietly
festive
voice
glad
to
see
the
pilgrim
here
at
last
you
not
off
already
and
laying
his
hand
on
shelton
arm
he
proposed
to
walk
a
little
way
with
him
across
the
fields
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
since
the
engagement
and
shelton
began
to
nerve
himself
to
express
some
sentiment
however
bald
about
it
he
squared
his
shoulders
cleared
his
throat
and
looked
askance
at
dennant
that
gentleman
was
walking
stiffly
his
cord
breeches
faintly
squeaking
he
switched
a
yellow
jointed
cane
against
his
leggings
and
after
each
blow
looked
at
his
legs
satirically
he
himself
was
rather
like
that
yellow
and
slim
and
jointed
with
features
arching
just
a
little
like
the
arching
of
its
handle
they
say
it
be
a
bad
year
for
fruit
shelton
said
at
last
my
dear
fellow
you
do
know
your
farmer
i
afraid
we
ought
to
hang
some
farmers
do
a
world
of
good
dear
souls
i
got
some
perfect
i
suppose
said
shelton
glad
to
postpone
the
evil
moment
in
a
climate
like
this
a
man
must
quite
so
quite
so
look
at
us
poor
slaves
of
if
i
could
abuse
the
farmers
i
should
be
wretched
did
you
ever
see
anything
finer
than
this
pasture
and
they
want
me
to
lower
their
rents
and
dennant
glance
satirically
wavered
rested
on
shelton
and
whisked
back
to
the
ground
as
though
he
had
seen
something
that
alarmed
him
there
was
a
pause
now
for
it
thought
the
younger
man
dennant
kept
his
eyes
fixed
on
his
boots
if
they
said
now
he
remarked
jocosely
that
the
frost
had
nipped
the
partridges
there
have
been
some
sense
in
it
but
what
can
you
expect
they
no
consideration
dear
souls
shelton
took
a
breath
and
with
averted
eyes
he
hurriedly
began
it
awfully
hard
sir
to
dennant
switched
his
cane
against
his
shin
yes
he
said
it
awfully
hard
to
put
up
with
but
what
can
a
fellow
do
one
must
have
farmers
why
if
it
was
for
the
farmers
there
be
still
a
hare
or
two
about
the
place
shelton
laughed
spasmodically
again
he
glanced
askance
at
his
future
what
did
the
waggling
of
his
head
mean
the
deepening
of
his
the
odd
contraction
of
the
mouth
and
his
eye
caught
dennant
eye
its
expression
was
queer
above
the
fine
dry
nose
one
of
the
sort
that
reddens
in
a
wind
i
never
had
much
to
do
with
farmers
he
said
at
last
have
you
lucky
fellow
the
most
yes
quite
the
most
trying
portion
of
the
human
species
next
to
well
sir
you
can
hardly
expect
me
began
shelton
i
do
oh
i
do
d
know
i
really
believe
we
in
for
a
a
large
black
cloud
had
covered
up
the
sun
and
some
drops
were
spattering
on
dennant
hard
felt
hat
shelton
welcomed
the
shower
it
appeared
to
him
an
intervention
on
the
part
of
providence
he
would
have
to
say
something
but
not
now
later
i
go
on
he
said
i
do
mind
the
rain
but
you
better
get
back
dear
me
i
a
tenant
in
this
cottage
said
dennant
in
his
leisurely
dry
manner
and
a
beggar
he
is
to
poach
too
least
we
can
do
to
ask
for
a
little
shelter
what
do
you
think
and
smiling
sarcastically
as
though
deprecating
his
intention
to
keep
dry
he
rapped
on
the
door
of
a
cottage
it
was
opened
by
a
girl
of
antonia
age
and
height
ah
phoebe
your
father
in
no
replied
the
girl
fluttering
father
out
so
sorry
will
you
let
us
bide
a
bit
out
of
the
rain
the
phoebe
dusted
them
two
chairs
and
curtseying
left
them
in
the
parlour
what
a
pretty
girl
said
shelton
yes
she
a
pretty
girl
half
the
young
fellows
are
after
her
but
she
wo
leave
her
father
oh
he
a
charming
rascal
is
that
fellow
this
remark
suddenly
brought
home
to
shelton
the
conviction
that
he
was
further
than
ever
from
avoiding
the
necessity
for
speaking
he
walked
over
to
the
window
the
rain
was
coming
down
with
fury
though
a
golden
line
far
down
the
sky
promised
the
shower
quick
end
for
sake
he
thought
let
me
say
something
however
idiotic
and
get
it
over
but
he
did
not
turn
a
kind
of
paralysis
had
seized
on
him
tremendous
heavy
rain
he
said
at
last
coming
down
in
it
would
have
been
just
as
easy
to
say
i
believe
your
daughter
to
be
the
sweetest
thing
on
earth
i
love
her
and
i
going
to
make
her
happy
just
as
easy
just
about
the
same
amount
of
breath
required
but
he
could
say
it
he
watched
the
rain
stream
and
hiss
against
the
leaves
and
churn
the
dust
on
the
parched
road
with
its
insistent
torrent
and
he
noticed
with
precision
all
the
details
of
the
process
going
on
outside
how
the
raindrops
darted
at
the
leaves
like
spears
and
how
the
leaves
shook
themselves
free
a
hundred
times
a
minute
while
little
runnels
of
water
rolled
over
their
edges
soft
and
quick
he
noticed
too
the
mournful
head
of
a
sheltering
cow
that
was
chewing
at
the
hedge
dennant
had
not
replied
to
his
remark
about
the
rain
so
disconcerting
was
this
silence
that
shelton
turned
his
future
upon
his
wooden
chair
was
staring
at
his
boots
bending
forward
above
his
parted
knees
and
prodding
at
the
carpet
a
glimpse
at
his
face
disturbed
shelton
resolution
it
was
not
forbidding
stern
discouraging
not
in
the
least
it
had
merely
for
the
moment
ceased
to
look
satirical
this
was
so
startling
that
shelton
lost
his
chance
of
speaking
there
seemed
a
heart
to
dennant
gravity
as
though
for
once
he
were
looking
grave
because
he
felt
so
but
glancing
up
at
shelton
his
dry
jocosity
reappeared
at
once
what
a
day
for
ducks
he
said
and
again
there
was
unmistakable
alarm
about
the
eye
was
it
possible
that
he
too
dreaded
something
i
ca
express
began
shelton
hurriedly
yes
it
beastly
to
get
wet
said
dennant
and
he
sang
for
we
can
wrestle
and
fight
my
boys
and
jump
out
you
be
with
us
for
that
next
week
eh
capital
there
the
bishop
of
blumenthal
and
old
sir
jack
buckwell
i
must
get
my
wife
to
put
you
between
them
for
it
my
delight
of
a
starry
night
the
bishop
a
great
man
and
old
buckwell
been
in
the
court
at
least
twice
in
the
season
of
the
year
will
you
please
to
take
some
tea
gentlemen
said
the
voice
of
phoebe
in
the
doorway
no
thank
you
phoebe
that
girl
ought
to
get
married
went
on
dennant
as
phoebe
blushingly
withdrew
a
flush
showed
queerly
on
his
sallow
cheeks
a
shame
to
keep
her
tied
like
this
to
her
selfish
fellow
that
he
looked
up
sharply
as
if
he
had
made
a
dangerous
remark
the
keeper
he
was
watching
us
for
him
we
did
care
shelton
suddenly
felt
certain
that
antonia
father
was
just
as
anxious
to
say
something
expressive
of
his
feelings
and
as
unable
as
himself
and
this
was
comforting
you
know
sir
he
began
but
dennant
eyebrows
rose
his
twinkled
his
personality
seemed
to
shrink
together
by
jove
he
said
it
stopped
now
our
chance
come
along
my
dear
fellow
delays
are
dangerous
and
with
his
bantering
courtesy
he
held
the
door
for
shelton
to
pass
out
i
think
we
part
here
he
said
i
almost
think
so
good
luck
to
you
he
held
out
his
dry
yellow
hand
shelton
seized
it
wrung
it
hard
and
muttered
the
word
grateful
again
dennant
eyebrows
quivered
as
if
they
had
been
tweaked
he
had
been
found
out
and
he
disliked
it
the
colour
in
his
face
had
died
away
it
was
calm
wrinkled
under
the
flattened
narrow
brim
of
his
black
hat
his
grey
moustache
drooped
thinly
the
hardened
round
his
eyes
his
nostrils
were
distended
by
the
queerest
smile
gratitude
he
said
almost
a
vice
is
it
shelton
face
quivered
he
raised
his
hat
and
turning
as
abruptly
as
his
senior
proceeded
on
his
way
he
had
been
playing
in
a
comedy
that
could
only
have
been
played
in
england
he
could
afford
to
smile
now
at
his
past
discomfort
having
no
longer
the
sense
of
duty
unfulfilled
everything
had
been
said
that
was
right
and
proper
to
be
said
in
the
way
that
we
such
things
should
say
no
violence
had
been
done
he
could
afford
to
smile
smile
at
himself
at
dennant
at
smile
at
the
sweet
aroma
of
the
earth
the
shy
unwilling
sweetness
that
only
rain
brings
forth
chapter
xxii
the
country
house
the
luncheon
hour
at
holm
oaks
was
as
in
many
country
houses
out
of
the
shooting
season
be
it
understood
the
soulful
hour
the
ferment
of
the
daily
doings
was
then
at
its
full
height
and
the
clamour
of
its
conversation
on
the
weather
and
the
dogs
the
horses
neighbours
cricket
golf
was
mingled
with
a
literary
murmur
for
the
dennants
were
superior
and
it
was
quite
usual
to
hear
remarks
like
these
have
you
read
that
charmin
thing
of
poser
or
yes
i
got
the
new
edition
of
old
bablington
delightfully
bound
so
and
it
was
in
july
that
holm
oaks
as
a
of
the
elect
was
at
its
best
for
in
july
it
had
become
customary
to
welcome
there
many
of
those
poor
souls
from
london
who
arrived
exhausted
by
the
season
and
than
whom
no
seamstress
in
a
back
could
better
have
earned
a
holiday
the
dennants
themselves
never
went
to
london
for
the
season
it
was
their
good
pleasure
not
to
a
week
or
fortnight
of
it
satisfied
them
they
had
a
radical
weakness
for
fresh
air
and
antonia
even
after
her
presentation
two
seasons
back
had
insisted
on
returning
home
stigmatising
london
balls
as
stuffy
when
shelton
arrived
the
stream
had
only
just
begun
but
every
day
brought
fresh
or
rather
jaded
people
to
occupy
the
old
dark
bedrooms
individually
he
liked
his
but
he
found
himself
observing
them
he
knew
that
if
a
man
judged
people
singly
almost
all
were
better
than
himself
only
when
judged
in
bulk
were
they
worthy
of
the
sweeping
criticisms
he
felt
inclined
to
pass
on
them
he
knew
this
just
as
he
knew
that
the
conventions
having
been
invented
to
prevent
man
following
his
natural
desires
were
merely
the
disapproving
sums
of
innumerable
individual
approvals
it
was
in
the
bulk
then
that
he
found
himself
observing
but
with
his
amiability
and
dread
of
notoriety
he
remained
to
all
appearance
a
docile
creature
and
he
kept
his
judgments
to
himself
in
the
matter
of
intellect
he
made
a
rough
division
of
the
guests
those
who
accepted
things
without
a
murmur
those
who
accepted
them
with
carping
jocularity
in
the
matter
of
morals
he
found
they
all
accepted
things
without
the
semblance
of
a
kick
to
show
sign
of
private
moral
judgment
was
to
have
lost
your
soul
and
worse
to
be
a
bit
of
an
outsider
he
gathered
this
by
intuition
rather
than
from
conversation
for
conversation
naturally
tabooed
such
questions
and
was
carried
on
in
the
loud
and
cheerful
tones
peculiar
to
people
of
good
breeding
shelton
had
never
been
able
to
acquire
this
tone
and
he
could
not
help
feeling
that
the
inability
made
him
more
or
less
an
object
of
suspicion
the
atmosphere
struck
him
as
it
never
had
before
causing
him
to
feel
a
doubt
of
his
gentility
could
a
man
suffer
from
passion
or
misgivings
and
remain
a
gentleman
it
seemed
improbable
one
of
his
a
man
called
edgbaston
and
with
a
dark
moustache
and
a
distinguished
air
of
meanness
disconcerted
him
one
day
by
remarking
of
an
unknown
person
a
lookin
chap
did
seem
to
know
his
shelton
was
harassed
by
a
horrid
doubt
everything
seemed
divided
into
classes
carefully
docketed
and
valued
for
instance
a
briton
was
of
more
value
than
a
man
and
wives
than
women
those
things
or
phases
of
life
with
which
people
had
no
personal
acquaintance
were
regarded
with
a
faint
amusement
and
a
certain
disapproval
the
principles
of
the
upper
class
in
fact
were
strictly
followed
he
was
in
that
hypersenstive
and
nervous
state
favourable
for
recording
currents
foreign
to
itself
things
he
had
never
before
noticed
now
had
profound
effect
on
him
such
as
the
tone
in
which
men
spoke
of
women
not
precisely
with
hostility
nor
exactly
with
contempt
best
perhaps
described
as
cultured
jeering
never
of
course
when
men
spoke
of
their
own
wives
mothers
sisters
or
immediate
friends
but
merely
when
they
spoke
of
any
other
women
he
reflected
upon
this
and
came
to
the
conclusion
that
among
the
upper
classes
each
man
own
property
was
holy
while
other
women
were
created
to
supply
him
with
gossip
jests
and
spice
another
thing
that
struck
him
was
the
way
in
which
the
war
then
going
on
was
made
into
an
affair
of
class
in
their
view
it
was
a
baddish
business
because
poor
hack
blank
and
peter
had
lost
their
lives
and
poor
teddy
blank
had
now
one
arm
instead
of
two
humanity
in
general
was
omitted
but
not
the
upper
classes
nor
incidentally
the
country
which
belonged
to
them
for
there
they
were
all
seated
in
a
row
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
horizon
of
their
lawns
late
one
evening
billiards
and
music
being
over
and
the
ladies
gone
shelton
returned
from
changing
to
his
and
dropped
into
one
of
the
great
that
even
in
summer
made
a
semicircle
round
the
fendered
hearth
fresh
from
his
parting
with
antonia
he
sat
perhaps
ten
minutes
before
he
began
to
take
in
all
the
figures
in
their
smoking
jackets
with
glasses
in
their
hands
and
cigars
between
their
teeth
the
man
in
the
next
chair
roused
him
by
putting
down
his
tumbler
with
a
tap
and
seating
himself
upon
the
cushioned
fender
through
the
mist
of
smoke
with
shoulders
hunched
elbows
and
knees
crooked
out
cigar
protruding
below
his
nose
and
the
crimson
collar
of
his
smoking
jacket
buttoned
close
as
plumage
on
his
breast
he
looked
a
little
like
a
gorgeous
bird
they
do
you
awfully
well
he
said
a
voice
from
the
chair
on
shelton
right
replied
they
do
you
better
at
the
veau
the
best
place
they
give
you
turkish
baths
for
nothing
drawled
a
fat
man
with
a
tiny
mouth
the
suavity
of
this
pronouncement
enfolded
all
as
with
a
blessing
and
at
once
as
if
by
magic
in
the
old
room
the
world
fell
naturally
into
its
three
departments
that
where
they
do
you
well
that
where
they
do
you
better
and
that
where
they
give
you
turkish
baths
for
nothing
if
you
want
turkish
baths
said
a
tall
youth
with
clean
red
face
who
had
come
into
the
room
and
stood
his
mouth
a
little
open
and
long
feet
jutting
with
sweet
helplessness
in
front
of
him
you
should
go
you
know
to
buda
pesth
most
awfully
rippin
shelton
saw
an
indescribable
appreciation
rise
on
every
face
as
though
they
had
been
offered
truffles
or
something
equally
delicious
oh
no
poodles
said
the
man
perched
on
the
fender
a
johnny
i
know
tells
me
they
nothing
to
his
face
was
transfigured
by
the
subtle
gloating
of
a
man
enjoying
vice
by
proxy
ah
drawled
the
man
there
nothing
fit
to
hold
a
candle
to
once
again
his
utterance
enfolded
all
as
with
a
blessing
and
once
again
the
world
fell
into
its
three
departments
that
where
they
do
you
well
that
where
they
do
you
better
and
baghdad
shelton
thought
to
himself
why
do
i
know
a
place
that
better
than
baghdad
he
felt
so
insignificant
it
seemed
that
he
knew
none
of
these
delightful
spots
that
he
was
of
no
use
to
any
of
his
though
privately
he
was
convinced
that
all
these
speakers
were
as
ignorant
as
himself
and
merely
found
it
warming
to
recall
such
things
as
they
had
heard
with
that
peculiar
gloating
look
alas
his
anecdotes
would
never
earn
for
him
that
prize
of
persons
in
society
the
label
of
a
good
chap
and
have
you
ever
been
in
baghdad
he
feebly
asked
the
fat
man
did
not
answer
he
had
begun
an
anecdote
and
in
his
broad
expanse
of
face
his
tiny
mouth
writhed
like
a
caterpillar
the
anecdote
was
humorous
with
the
exception
of
antonia
shelton
saw
but
little
of
the
ladies
for
following
the
custom
of
the
country
house
men
and
women
avoided
each
other
as
much
as
might
be
they
met
at
meals
and
occasionally
joined
in
tennis
and
in
croquet
otherwise
it
seemed
almost
orientally
agreed
that
they
were
better
kept
apart
chancing
one
day
to
enter
the
withdrawing
room
while
searching
for
antonia
he
found
that
he
had
lighted
on
a
feminine
discussion
he
would
have
beaten
a
retreat
of
course
but
it
seemed
too
obvious
that
he
was
merely
looking
for
his
fiancee
so
sitting
down
he
listened
the
honourable
charlotte
penguin
still
knitting
a
silk
tie
the
sixth
since
that
she
had
been
knitting
at
hyeres
sat
on
the
low
close
to
a
hydrangea
the
petals
of
whose
round
flowers
almost
kissed
her
sanguine
cheek
her
eyes
were
fixed
with
languid
aspiration
on
the
lady
who
was
speaking
this
was
a
square
woman
of
medium
height
with
grey
hair
brushed
from
her
low
forehead
the
expression
of
whose
face
was
brisk
and
rather
cross
she
was
standing
with
a
book
as
if
delivering
a
sermon
had
she
been
a
man
she
might
have
been
described
as
a
bright
young
man
of
business
for
though
grey
she
never
could
be
old
nor
ever
lose
the
power
of
forming
quick
decisions
her
features
and
her
eyes
were
prompt
and
slightly
hard
tinged
with
faith
fanatical
in
the
justice
of
her
judgments
and
she
had
that
fussy
simpleness
of
dress
which
indicates
the
right
to
meddle
not
red
not
white
neither
yellow
nor
quite
blue
her
complexion
was
suffused
with
a
certain
mixture
of
these
colours
adapted
to
the
climate
and
her
smile
had
a
strange
sour
sweetness
like
nothing
but
the
flavour
of
an
apple
on
the
turn
i
do
care
what
they
tell
you
she
was
saying
not
offensively
though
her
voice
seemed
to
imply
that
she
had
no
time
to
waste
in
pleasing
in
all
my
dealings
with
them
i
found
it
best
to
treat
them
quite
like
a
lady
behind
the
times
smiled
her
mouth
indeed
her
whole
hard
handsome
face
was
reminiscent
of
dappled
found
in
the
soho
bazaar
she
crossed
her
feet
and
some
rich
and
silk
stuff
rustled
her
whole
personality
seemed
to
creak
as
without
looking
she
answered
in
harsh
tones
i
find
the
poor
are
most
delightful
sybil
dennant
seated
on
the
sofa
with
a
feathery
laugh
shot
a
barking
terrier
dog
at
shelton
here
dick
she
said
well
dick
what
your
opinion
shelton
looked
around
him
scared
the
elder
ladies
who
had
spoken
had
fixed
their
eyes
on
him
and
in
their
gaze
he
read
his
utter
insignificance
oh
that
young
man
they
seemed
to
say
expect
a
practical
remark
from
him
now
come
opinion
he
stammered
of
the
poor
i
have
the
person
on
her
feet
whose
name
was
mattock
directing
her
peculiar
smile
at
the
distinguished
lady
with
the
times
said
perhaps
you
not
had
experience
of
them
in
london
lady
bonington
lady
bonington
in
answer
rustled
oh
do
tell
us
about
the
slums
mattock
cried
sybil
slumming
must
be
splendid
it
so
deadly
here
nothing
but
flannel
the
poor
my
dear
began
mattock
are
not
the
least
bit
what
you
think
them
oh
d
you
know
i
think
they
rather
nice
broke
in
aunt
charlotte
close
to
the
hydrangea
you
think
so
said
mattock
sharply
i
find
they
do
nothing
but
they
do
grumble
at
me
they
are
delightful
persons
and
lady
bonington
gave
shelton
a
grim
smile
he
could
not
help
thinking
that
to
grumble
in
the
presence
of
that
rich
despotic
personality
would
require
a
superhuman
courage
they
the
most
ungrateful
people
in
the
world
said
mattock
why
then
thought
shelton
do
you
go
amongst
them
she
continued
one
must
do
them
good
one
must
do
one
duty
but
as
to
getting
thanks
lady
bonington
sardonically
said
poor
things
they
have
a
lot
to
the
little
children
murmured
aunt
charlotte
with
a
flushing
cheek
and
shining
eyes
it
rather
children
indeed
said
mattock
it
puts
me
out
of
all
patience
to
see
the
way
that
they
neglect
them
people
are
so
sentimental
about
the
lady
bonington
creaked
again
her
splendid
shoulders
were
wedged
into
her
chair
her
fine
dark
hair
gleaming
with
silver
sprang
back
upon
her
brow
a
ruby
bracelet
glowed
on
the
powerful
wrist
that
held
the
journal
she
rocked
her
foot
she
did
not
appear
to
be
too
sentimental
i
know
they
often
have
a
very
easy
time
said
mattock
as
if
some
one
had
injured
her
severely
and
shelton
saw
not
without
pity
that
fate
had
scored
her
kind
and
face
with
wrinkles
whose
tiny
furrows
were
eloquent
of
good
intentions
frustrated
by
the
unpractical
and
discontented
poor
do
what
you
will
they
are
never
satisfied
they
only
resent
one
help
or
else
they
take
the
help
and
never
thank
you
for
it
oh
murmured
aunt
charlotte
that
rather
shelton
had
been
growing
more
uneasy
he
said
abruptly
i
should
do
the
same
if
i
were
mattock
brown
eyes
flew
at
him
lady
bonington
spoke
to
the
times
her
ruby
bracelet
and
a
bangle
jingled
we
ought
to
put
ourselves
in
their
shelton
could
not
help
a
smile
lady
bonington
in
the
places
of
the
poor
oh
exclaimed
mattock
i
put
myself
entirely
in
their
place
i
quite
understand
their
feelings
but
ingratitude
is
a
repulsive
they
seem
unable
to
put
themselves
in
your
place
murmured
shelton
and
in
a
fit
of
courage
he
took
the
room
in
with
a
sweeping
glance
yes
that
room
was
wonderfully
consistent
with
its
air
of
perfect
as
if
each
picture
and
each
piece
of
furniture
each
book
each
lady
present
had
been
made
from
patterns
they
were
all
widely
different
yet
all
like
works
of
art
seen
in
some
exhibitions
had
the
look
of
being
after
the
designs
of
some
original
spirit
the
whole
room
was
chaste
restrained
derived
practical
and
comfortable
neither
in
virtue
nor
in
work
neither
in
manner
speech
appearance
nor
in
theory
could
it
give
itself
away
chapter
xxiii
the
man
still
looking
for
antonia
shelton
went
up
to
the
thea
dennant
and
another
girl
were
seated
in
the
window
talking
from
the
look
they
gave
him
he
saw
that
he
had
better
never
have
been
born
he
hastily
withdrew
descending
to
the
hall
he
came
on
dennant
crossing
to
his
study
with
a
handful
of
papers
ah
shelton
said
he
you
look
a
little
lost
is
the
shrine
invisible
shelton
grinned
said
yes
and
went
on
looking
he
was
not
fortunate
in
the
sat
dennant
making
up
her
list
of
books
do
give
me
your
opinion
dick
she
said
everybody
readin
this
thing
of
katherine
asterick
i
believe
it
simply
because
she
got
a
one
must
read
a
book
for
some
reason
or
other
answered
shelton
well
returned
dennant
i
hate
doin
things
just
because
other
people
do
them
and
i
get
good
dennant
marked
the
catalogue
here
linseed
last
of
course
though
i
must
say
i
do
care
for
him
but
i
suppose
we
ought
to
have
it
in
the
house
and
quality
splendid
diatribes
that
sure
to
be
good
he
always
so
refined
but
what
am
i
to
do
about
this
of
arthur
baal
they
say
that
he
a
charlatan
but
everybody
reads
him
do
you
know
and
over
the
catalogue
shelton
caught
the
gleam
of
eyes
decision
had
vanished
from
her
face
with
its
arched
nose
and
slightly
sloping
chin
as
though
some
one
had
suddenly
appealed
to
her
to
trust
her
instincts
it
was
quite
pathetic
still
there
was
always
the
circulation
to
form
her
judgment
by
i
think
i
better
mark
it
she
said
do
you
were
you
for
antonia
if
you
come
across
bunyan
in
the
garden
dick
do
say
i
want
to
see
him
he
gettin
to
be
a
perfect
nuisance
i
can
understand
his
feelin
but
really
he
carryin
it
too
primed
with
his
message
to
the
shelton
went
he
took
a
despairing
look
into
the
antonia
was
not
there
instead
a
tall
and
gentleman
with
a
neat
moustache
called
mabbey
was
practising
the
he
paused
as
shelton
entered
and
pouting
like
a
baby
asked
in
a
sleepy
voice
play
me
a
hundred
up
shelton
shook
his
head
stammered
out
his
sorrow
and
was
about
to
go
the
gentleman
called
mabbey
plaintively
feeling
the
places
where
his
moustaches
joined
his
pink
and
glossy
cheeks
asked
with
an
air
of
some
surprise
what
your
general
game
then
i
really
do
know
said
shelton
the
gentleman
called
mabbey
chalked
his
cue
and
moving
his
round
legs
in
their
tight
trousers
took
up
his
position
for
the
stroke
what
price
that
he
said
as
he
regained
the
perpendicular
and
his
eyes
followed
shelton
with
sleepy
inquisition
curious
dark
horse
shelton
they
seemed
to
say
shelton
hurried
out
and
was
about
to
run
down
the
lower
lawn
when
he
was
accosted
by
another
person
walking
in
the
sunshine
a
man
in
a
collar
with
a
thin
and
fair
moustache
and
a
faint
bluish
tint
on
one
side
of
his
high
forehead
caused
by
a
network
of
thin
veins
his
face
had
something
of
the
youthful
optimistic
look
peculiar
to
the
refined
english
type
he
walked
elastically
yet
with
trim
precision
as
if
he
had
a
pleasant
taste
in
furniture
and
churches
and
held
the
spectator
in
his
hand
ah
shelton
he
said
in
tones
halting
his
legs
in
such
an
easy
attitude
that
it
was
impossible
to
interrupt
it
come
to
take
the
air
shelton
own
brown
face
nondescript
nose
and
his
amiable
but
dogged
chin
contrasted
strangely
with
the
features
of
the
man
i
hear
from
halidome
that
you
going
to
stand
for
parliament
the
latter
said
shelton
recalling
halidome
autocratic
manner
of
settling
other
people
business
smiled
do
i
look
like
it
he
asked
the
eyebrows
quivered
on
the
man
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
perhaps
that
to
stand
for
parliament
a
man
must
look
like
it
he
examined
shelton
with
some
curiosity
ah
well
he
said
now
you
mention
it
perhaps
his
eyes
so
carefully
ironical
although
they
differed
from
the
eyes
of
mabbey
also
seemed
to
ask
of
shelton
what
sort
of
a
dark
horse
he
was
you
still
in
the
domestic
office
then
asked
shelton
the
man
stooped
to
sniff
a
rosebush
yes
he
said
it
suits
me
very
well
i
get
lots
of
time
for
my
art
that
must
be
very
interesting
said
shelton
whose
glance
was
roving
for
antonia
i
never
managed
to
begin
a
never
had
a
hobby
said
the
man
brushing
back
his
hair
he
was
walking
with
no
hat
why
what
the
deuce
d
you
do
shelton
could
not
answer
the
idea
had
never
troubled
him
i
really
do
know
he
said
embarrassed
there
always
something
going
on
as
far
as
i
can
the
man
placed
his
hands
within
his
pockets
and
his
bright
glance
swept
over
his
companion
a
fellow
must
have
a
hobby
to
give
him
an
interest
in
life
he
said
an
interest
in
life
repeated
shelton
grimly
life
itself
is
good
enough
for
oh
replied
the
man
as
though
he
disapproved
of
regarding
life
itself
as
interesting
that
all
very
well
but
you
want
something
more
than
that
why
you
take
up
woodcarving
the
moment
i
get
fagged
with
office
papers
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
take
up
my
good
as
a
game
of
i
have
the
the
eyebrows
of
the
man
twitched
he
twisted
his
moustache
you
find
not
having
a
hobby
does
pay
he
said
you
get
old
then
where
you
be
it
came
as
a
surprise
that
he
should
use
the
words
it
does
pay
for
he
had
a
kind
of
partially
enamelled
look
like
that
modern
jewellery
which
really
seems
unconscious
of
its
market
value
you
given
up
the
bar
do
you
get
awfully
bored
having
nothing
to
do
pursued
the
man
stopping
before
an
ancient
sundial
shelton
felt
a
delicacy
as
a
man
naturally
would
in
explaining
that
being
in
love
was
in
itself
enough
to
do
to
do
nothing
is
unworthy
of
a
man
but
he
had
never
felt
as
yet
the
want
of
any
occupation
his
silence
in
no
way
disconcerted
his
acquaintance
that
a
nice
old
article
of
virtue
he
said
pointing
with
his
chin
and
walking
round
the
sundial
he
made
its
acquaintance
from
the
other
side
its
grey
profile
cast
a
thin
and
shortening
shadow
on
the
turf
tongues
of
moss
were
licking
at
its
sides
the
daisies
clustered
thick
around
its
base
it
had
acquired
a
look
of
growing
from
the
soil
i
should
like
to
get
hold
of
that
the
man
remarked
i
do
know
when
i
seen
a
better
specimen
and
he
walked
round
it
once
again
his
eyebrows
were
still
ironically
arched
but
below
them
his
eyes
were
almost
calculating
and
below
them
again
his
mouth
had
opened
just
a
little
a
person
with
a
keener
eye
would
have
said
his
face
looked
greedy
and
even
shelton
was
surprised
as
though
he
had
read
in
the
spectator
a
confession
of
commercialism
you
could
uproot
a
thing
like
that
he
said
it
would
lose
all
its
his
companion
turned
impatiently
and
his
countenance
looked
wonderfully
genuine
could
i
he
said
by
jove
i
thought
so
the
best
he
ran
his
forger
round
the
sundial
edge
splendid
as
the
day
they
made
it
you
do
seem
to
care
much
about
that
sort
of
thing
and
once
again
as
though
accustomed
to
the
indifference
of
vandals
his
face
regained
its
mask
they
strolled
on
towards
the
kitchen
gardens
shelton
still
busy
searching
every
patch
of
shade
he
wanted
to
say
ca
stop
and
hurry
off
but
there
was
about
the
man
a
something
that
while
stinging
shelton
feelings
made
the
showing
of
them
quite
impossible
feelings
that
person
seemed
to
say
all
very
well
but
you
want
more
than
that
why
not
take
up
feelings
i
was
born
in
england
and
have
been
at
are
you
staying
long
he
asked
shelton
i
go
on
to
suppose
i
see
you
there
good
chap
old
halidome
collection
of
etchings
very
fine
no
i
staying
on
said
shelton
ah
said
the
man
charming
people
the
dennants
shelton
reddening
slowly
turned
his
head
away
he
picked
a
gooseberry
and
muttered
the
eldest
girl
especially
no
nonsense
about
her
i
thought
she
was
a
particularly
nice
shelton
heard
this
praise
of
antonia
with
an
odd
sensation
it
gave
him
the
reverse
of
pleasure
as
though
the
words
had
cast
new
light
upon
her
he
grunted
hastily
i
suppose
you
know
that
we
engaged
really
said
the
man
and
again
his
bright
clear
glance
swept
over
shelton
really
i
did
know
congratulate
you
it
was
as
if
he
said
you
a
man
of
taste
i
should
say
she
would
go
well
in
almost
any
thanks
said
shelton
there
she
is
if
you
excuse
me
i
want
to
speak
to
chapter
xxiv
paradise
antonia
in
a
sunny
angle
of
the
old
brick
wall
amid
the
pinks
and
poppies
and
cornflowers
was
humming
to
herself
shelton
saw
the
man
pass
out
of
sight
then
unobserved
he
watched
her
smelling
at
the
flowers
caressing
her
face
with
each
in
turn
casting
away
spoiled
blossoms
and
all
the
time
humming
that
soft
tune
in
two
months
or
three
all
barriers
between
himself
and
this
inscrutable
young
eve
would
break
she
would
be
a
part
of
him
and
he
a
part
of
her
he
would
know
all
her
thoughts
and
she
all
his
together
they
would
be
as
one
and
all
would
think
of
them
and
talk
of
them
as
one
and
this
would
come
about
by
standing
half
an
hour
together
in
a
church
by
the
passing
of
a
ring
and
the
signing
of
their
names
the
sun
was
burnishing
her
hair
she
wore
no
hat
flushing
her
cheeks
sweetening
and
making
sensuous
her
limbs
it
had
warmed
her
through
and
through
so
that
like
the
flowers
and
bees
the
sunlight
and
the
air
she
was
all
motion
light
and
colour
she
turned
and
saw
shelton
standing
there
oh
dick
she
said
lend
me
your
to
put
these
flowers
in
there
a
good
boy
her
candid
eyes
blue
as
the
flowers
in
her
hands
were
clear
and
cool
as
ice
but
in
her
smile
was
all
the
warm
profusion
of
that
corner
the
sweetness
had
soaked
into
her
and
was
welling
forth
again
the
sight
of
those
cheeks
and
fingers
twining
round
the
her
pearly
teeth
and
hair
all
fragrant
stole
the
reason
out
of
shelton
he
stood
before
her
weak
about
the
knees
found
you
at
last
he
said
curving
back
her
neck
she
cried
out
catch
and
with
a
sweep
of
both
her
hands
flung
the
flowers
into
shelton
arms
under
the
rain
of
flowers
all
warm
and
odorous
he
dropped
down
on
his
knees
and
put
them
one
by
one
together
smelling
at
the
pinks
to
hide
the
violence
of
his
feelings
antonia
went
on
picking
flowers
and
every
time
her
hand
was
full
she
dropped
them
on
his
hat
his
shoulder
or
his
arms
and
went
on
plucking
more
she
smiled
and
on
her
lips
a
little
devil
danced
that
seemed
to
know
what
he
was
suffering
and
shelton
felt
that
she
did
know
are
you
tired
she
asked
there
are
heaps
more
wanted
these
are
the
fourteen
lots
i
ca
think
how
people
can
live
without
flowers
can
you
and
close
above
his
head
she
buried
her
face
in
pinks
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
plucked
flowers
before
him
on
the
grass
and
forced
himself
to
answer
i
think
i
can
hold
poor
old
dick
she
had
stepped
back
the
sun
lit
the
profile
of
her
cheek
and
poured
its
gold
over
the
bosom
of
her
blouse
poor
old
dick
awfully
hard
luck
is
it
burdened
with
mignonette
she
came
so
close
again
that
now
she
touched
his
shoulder
but
shelton
did
not
look
breathless
with
wildly
beating
heart
he
went
on
sorting
out
the
flowers
the
seeds
of
mignonette
rained
on
his
neck
and
as
she
let
the
blossoms
fall
their
perfume
fanned
his
face
you
need
sort
them
out
she
said
was
she
enticing
him
he
stole
a
look
but
she
was
gone
again
swaying
and
sniffing
at
the
flowers
i
suppose
i
only
hindering
you
he
growled
i
better
she
laughed
i
like
to
see
you
on
your
knees
you
look
so
funny
and
as
she
spoke
she
flung
a
clove
carnation
at
him
does
it
smell
good
too
good
oh
antonia
why
are
you
doing
this
why
am
i
doing
what
do
you
know
what
you
are
doing
why
picking
flowers
and
once
more
she
was
back
bending
and
sniffing
at
the
blossoms
that
oh
no
she
called
it
not
not
nearly
keep
on
putting
them
together
if
you
love
you
know
i
love
you
answered
shelton
in
a
smothered
voice
antonia
gazed
at
him
across
her
shoulder
puzzled
and
inquiring
was
her
face
i
not
a
bit
like
you
she
said
what
will
you
have
for
your
room
choose
cornflowers
and
clove
pinks
poppies
are
too
frivolous
and
pinks
too
white
said
shelton
and
mignonette
too
hard
and
sweet
why
cornflowers
antonia
stood
before
him
with
her
hands
against
her
sides
her
figure
was
so
slim
and
young
her
face
uncertain
and
so
grave
because
they
dark
and
and
why
clove
pinks
antonia
did
not
answer
and
why
clove
pinks
because
she
said
and
flushing
touched
a
bee
that
had
settled
on
her
skirt
because
of
something
in
you
i
do
ah
and
what
flowers
shall
t
give
you
she
put
her
hands
behind
her
there
are
all
the
other
flowers
for
shelton
snatched
from
the
mass
in
front
of
him
an
iceland
poppy
with
straight
stem
and
a
curved
neck
white
pinks
and
sprigs
of
hard
sweet
mignonette
and
held
it
out
to
her
there
he
said
that
but
antonia
did
not
move
oh
no
it
is
and
behind
her
back
her
fingers
slowly
crushed
the
petals
of
a
poppy
she
shook
her
head
smiling
a
brilliant
smile
the
blossoms
fell
he
flung
his
arms
around
her
and
kissed
her
on
the
lips
but
his
hands
dropped
not
fear
exactly
nor
exactly
shame
had
come
to
him
she
had
not
resisted
but
he
had
kissed
the
smile
away
had
kissed
a
strange
cold
frightened
look
into
her
eyes
she
did
mean
to
tempt
me
then
he
thought
in
surprise
and
anger
what
did
she
mean
and
like
a
scolded
dog
he
kept
his
troubled
watch
upon
her
face
chapter

the
ride
where
now
antonia
asked
wheeling
her
chestnut
mare
as
they
turned
up
high
street
oxford
city
i
wo
go
back
the
same
way
dick
we
could
have
a
gallop
on
port
meadow
cross
the
upper
river
twice
and
get
home
that
way
but
you
be
antonia
shook
her
head
aslant
her
cheek
the
brim
of
a
straw
hat
threw
a
curve
of
shade
her
ear
glowed
transparent
in
the
sun
a
difference
had
come
in
their
relations
since
that
kiss
outwardly
she
was
the
same
good
comrade
cool
and
quick
but
as
before
a
change
one
feels
the
subtle
difference
in
the
temper
of
the
wind
so
shelton
was
affected
by
the
inner
change
in
her
he
had
made
a
blot
upon
her
candour
he
had
tried
to
rub
it
out
again
but
there
was
left
a
mark
and
it
was
ineffaceable
antonia
belonged
to
the
most
civilised
division
of
the
race
most
civilised
in
all
the
world
whose
creed
is
let
us
love
and
hate
let
us
work
and
marry
but
let
us
never
give
ourselves
away
to
give
ourselves
away
is
to
leave
a
mark
and
that
is
past
forgive
ness
let
our
lives
be
like
our
faces
free
from
every
kind
of
wrinkle
even
those
of
laughter
in
this
way
alone
can
we
be
really
he
felt
that
she
was
ruffled
by
a
vague
discomfort
that
he
should
give
himself
away
was
natural
perhaps
and
only
made
her
wonder
but
that
he
should
give
her
the
feeling
that
she
had
given
herself
away
was
a
very
different
thing
do
you
mind
if
i
just
ask
at
the
bishop
head
for
letters
he
said
as
they
passed
the
old
hotel
a
dirty
and
thin
envelope
was
brought
to
him
addressed
mr
richard
shelton
in
handwriting
that
was
passionately
clear
as
though
the
writer
had
put
his
soul
into
securing
delivery
of
the
letter
it
was
dated
three
days
back
and
as
they
rode
away
shelton
read
as
follows
imperial
peacock
hotel
folkestone
mon
cher
monsieur
shelton
this
is
already
the
third
time
i
have
taken
up
pen
to
write
to
you
but
having
nothing
but
misfortune
to
recount
i
hesitated
awaiting
better
days
indeed
i
have
been
so
profoundly
discouraged
that
if
i
had
not
thought
it
my
duty
to
let
you
know
of
my
fortunes
i
know
not
even
now
if
i
should
have
found
the
necessary
spirit
choses
vont

from
what
i
hear
there
has
never
been
so
bad
a
season
here
nothing
going
on
all
the
same
i
am
tormented
by
a
mob
of
little
matters
which
bring
me
not
sufficient
to
support
my
life
i
know
not
what
to
do
one
thing
is
certain
in
no
case
shall
i
return
here
another
year
the
patron
of
this
hotel
my
good
employer
is
one
of
those
innumerable
specimens
who
do
not
forge
or
steal
because
they
have
no
need
and
if
they
had
would
lack
the
courage
who
observe
the
marriage
laws
because
they
have
been
brought
up
to
believe
in
them
and
know
that
breaking
them
brings
risk
and
loss
of
reputation
who
do
not
gamble
because
they
dare
not
do
not
drink
because
it
disagrees
with
them
go
to
church
because
their
neighbours
go
and
to
procure
an
appetite
for
the
meal
commit
no
murder
because
not
transgressing
in
any
other
fashion
they
are
not
obliged
what
is
there
to
respect
in
persons
of
this
sort
yet
they
are
highly
esteemed
and
form
three
quarters
of
society
the
rule
with
these
good
gentlemen
is
to
shut
their
eyes
never
use
their
thinking
powers
and
close
the
door
on
all
the
dogs
of
life
for
fear
they
should
get
bitten
shelton
paused
conscious
of
antonia
eyes
fixed
on
him
with
the
inquiring
look
that
he
had
come
to
dread
in
that
chilly
questioning
she
seemed
to
say
i
am
waiting
i
am
prepared
to
be
told
things
that
is
useful
things
things
that
help
one
to
believe
without
the
risk
of
too
much
it
from
that
young
foreigner
he
said
and
went
on
reading
to
himself
i
have
eyes
and
here
i
am
i
have
a

see
that

i
see
no

and
certainly
should
have
departed

i

as
i

told

you

your

devoted
louis
ferrand
he
rode
with
the
letter
open
in
his
hand
frowning
at
the
curious
turmoil
which
ferrand
excited
in
his
heart
it
was
as
though
this
foreign
vagrant
twanged
within
him
a
neglected
string
which
gave
forth
moans
of
a
mutiny
what
does
he
say
antonia
asked
should
he
show
it
to
her
if
he
might
not
what
should
he
do
when
they
were
married
i
do
quite
know
he
said
at
last
it
not
particularly
what
is
he
like
dick
i
mean
to
look
at
like
a
gentleman
or
what
shelton
stifled
a
desire
to
laugh
he
looks
very
well
in
a
he
replied
his
father
was
a

antonia
flicked
her
whip
against
her
skirt
of
course
she
murmured
i
do
want
to
hear
if
there
anything
i
ought
but
instead
of
soothing
shelton
these
words
had
just
the
opposite
effect
his
conception
of
the
ideal
wife
was
not
that
of
one
from
whom
the
half
of
life
must
be
excluded
it
only
he
stammered
again
that
it
not
oh
all
right
she
cried
and
touching
her
horse
flew
off
in
front
i
hate
dismal
shelton
bit
his
lips
it
was
not
his
fault
that
half
the
world
was
dark
he
knew
her
words
were
loosed
against
himself
and
as
always
at
a
sign
of
her
displeasure
was
afraid
he
galloped
after
her
on
the
scorched
turf
what
is
it
he
said
you
angry
with
me
oh
no
darling
i
ca
help
it
if
things
are
cheerful
we
have
eyes
he
added
quoting
from
the
letter
antonia
did
not
look
at
him
but
touched
her
horse
again
well
i
do
want
to
see
the
gloomy
side
she
said
and
i
ca
see
why
you
should
it
wicked
to
be
discontented
and
she
galloped
off
it
was
not
his
fault
if
there
were
a
thousand
different
kinds
of
men
a
thousand
different
points
of
view
outside
the
fence
of
her
experience
what
business
he
thought
digging
in
his
dummy
spurs
has
our
class
to
patronise
we
the
only
people
who
have
an
idea
of
what
life
really
chips
of
dried
turf
and
dust
came
flying
back
stinging
his
face
he
gained
on
her
drew
almost
within
reach
then
as
though
she
had
been
playing
with
him
was
left
hopelessly
behind
she
stooped
under
the
far
hedge
fanning
her
flushed
face
with
aha
dick
i
knew
you
never
catch
me
and
she
patted
the
chestnut
mare
who
turned
her
blowing
muzzle
with
contemptuous
humour
towards
shelton
steed
while
her
flanks
heaved
rapturously
gradually
darkening
with
sweat
we
better
take
them
steadily
grunted
shelton
getting
off
and
loosening
his
girths
if
we
mean
to
get
home
at
do
be
cross
dick
we
ought
to
have
galloped
them
like
this
they
not
in
condition
we
better
go
home
the
way
we
antonia
dropped
the
reins
and
straightened
her
back
hair
there
no
fun
in
that
she
said
out
and
back
again
i
hate
a
very
well
said
shelton
he
would
have
her
longer
to
himself
the
road
led
up
and
up
a
hill
and
from
the
top
a
vision
of
saxonia
lay
disclosed
in
waves
of
wood
and
pasture
their
way
branched
down
a
gateless
glade
and
shelton
sidled
closer
till
his
knee
touched
the
mare
antonia
profile
conjured
up
visions
she
was
youth
itself
her
eyes
so
brilliant
and
so
innocent
her
cheeks
so
glowing
and
her
brow
unruffled
but
in
her
smile
and
in
the
setting
of
her
jaw
lurked
something
resolute
and
mischievous
shelton
put
his
hand
out
to
the
mare
mane
what
made
you
promise
to
marry
me
he
said
she
smiled
well
what
made
you
i
cried
shelton
she
slipped
her
hand
over
his
hand
oh
dick
she
said
i
want
he
stammered
to
be
everything
to
you
do
you
think
i
shall
of
course
of
course
the
words
seemed
very
much
or
very
little
she
looked
down
at
the
river
gleaming
below
the
glade
in
a
curving
silver
line
dick
there
are
such
a
lot
of
splendid
things
that
we
might
did
she
mean
amongst
those
splendid
things
that
they
might
understand
each
other
or
were
they
fated
to
pretend
to
only
in
the
old
way
they
crossed
the
river
by
a
ferry
and
rode
a
long
time
in
silence
while
the
twilight
slowly
fell
behind
the
aspens
and
all
the
beauty
of
the
evening
with
its
restless
leaves
its
grave
young
moon
and
lighted
campion
flowers
was
but
a
part
of
her
the
scents
the
witchery
and
shadows
the
quaint
field
noises
the
yokels
whistling
and
the
splash
of
each
seemed
to
him
enchanted
the
flighting
bats
the
forms
of
the
dim
hayricks
and
summed
them
all
up
in
herself
the
fingermarks
had
deepened
underneath
her
eyes
a
languor
came
upon
her
it
made
her
the
more
sweet
and
youthful
her
shoulders
seemed
to
bear
on
them
the
very
image
of
our
land
grave
and
aspiring
eager
yet
contained
before
there
came
upon
that
land
the
grin
of
greed
the
folds
of
wealth
the
simper
of
content
fair
unconscious
free
and
he
was
silent
with
a
beating
heart
chapter
xxvi
the
bird
passage
that
night
after
the
ride
when
shelton
was
about
to
go
to
bed
his
eyes
fell
on
ferrand
letter
and
with
a
sleepy
sense
of
duty
he
began
to
read
it
through
a
second
time
in
the
dark
bedroom
his
bed
with
back
of
crimson
damask
and
its
dainty
sheets
was
lighted
by
the
candle
glow
the
copper
pitcher
of
hot
water
in
the
basin
the
silver
of
his
brushes
and
the
line
of
his
boots
all
shone
and
shelton
face
alone
was
gloomy
staring
at
the
yellowish
paper
in
his
hand
the
poor
chap
wants
money
of
course
he
thought
but
why
go
on
for
ever
helping
one
who
had
no
claim
on
him
a
hopeless
case
incurable
one
whom
it
was
his
duty
to
let
sink
for
the
good
of
the
community
at
large
ferrand
vagabond
refinement
had
beguiled
him
into
charity
that
should
have
been
bestowed
on
hospitals
or
any
charitable
work
but
foreign
missions
to
give
a
helping
hand
a
bit
of
himself
a
nod
of
fellowship
to
any
irrespective
of
a
claim
merely
because
he
happened
to
be
down
was
sentimental
nonsense
the
line
must
be
drawn
but
in
the
muttering
of
this
conclusion
he
experienced
a
twinge
of
honesty
humbug
you
do
want
to
part
with
your
money
that
all
so
sitting
down
in
at
his
writing
table
he
penned
the
following
on
paper
stamped
with
the
holm
oaks
address
and
crest
my
dear
ferrand
i
am
sorry
you
are
having
such
a
bad
spell
you
seem
to
be
dead
out
of
luck
i
hope
by
the
time
you
get
this
things
will
have
changed
for
the
better
i
should
very
much
like
to
see
you
again
and
have
a
talk
but
shall
be
away
for
some
time
longer
and
doubt
even
when
i
get
back
whether
i
should
be
able
to
run
down
and
look
you
up
keep
me
courant
as
to
your
movements
i
enclose
a
cheque
yours
sincerely
richard
shelton
before
he
had
written
out
the
cheque
a
moth
fluttering
round
the
candle
distracted
his
attention
and
by
the
time
he
had
caught
and
put
it
out
he
had
forgotten
that
the
cheque
was
not
enclosed
the
letter
removed
with
his
clothes
before
he
was
awake
was
posted
in
an
empty
state
one
morning
a
week
later
he
was
sitting
in
the
in
the
company
of
the
gentleman
called
mabbey
who
was
telling
him
how
many
grouse
he
had
deprived
of
life
on
august
last
year
and
how
many
he
intended
to
deprive
of
life
on
august
this
year
when
the
door
was
opened
and
the
butler
entered
carrying
his
head
as
though
it
held
some
fatal
secret
a
young
man
is
asking
for
you
sir
he
said
to
shelton
bending
down
discreetly
i
do
know
if
you
would
wish
to
see
him
a
young
man
repeated
shelton
what
sort
of
a
young
man
i
should
say
a
sort
of
foreigner
sir
apologetically
replied
the
butler
he
wearing
a
but
he
looks
as
if
he
had
been
walking
a
good
shelton
rose
with
haste
the
description
sounded
to
him
ominous
where
is
he
i
put
him
in
the
young
ladies
little
room
all
right
said
shelton
i
come
and
see
him
now
what
the
deuce
he
thought
running
down
the
stairs
it
was
with
a
queer
commingling
of
pleasure
and
vexation
that
he
entered
the
little
chamber
sacred
to
the
birds
beasts
racquets
and
general
young
ladies
litter
ferrand
was
standing
underneath
the
cage
of
a
canary
his
hands
folded
on
his
hat
a
nervous
smile
upon
his
lips
he
was
dressed
in
shelton
old
tightly
buttoned
and
would
have
cut
a
stylish
figure
but
far
his
look
of
travel
he
wore
a
pair
of
too
which
somewhat
veiled
his
cynical
blue
eyes
and
clashed
a
little
with
the
pagan
look
of
him
in
the
midst
of
the
strange
surroundings
he
still
preserved
that
air
of
knowing
and
being
master
of
his
fate
which
was
his
chief
attraction
i
glad
to
see
you
said
shelton
holding
out
his
hand
forgive
this
liberty
began
ferrand
but
i
thought
it
due
to
you
after
all
you
done
for
me
not
to
throw
up
my
efforts
to
get
employment
in
england
without
letting
you
know
first
i
entirely
at
the
end
of
my
the
phrase
struck
shelton
as
one
that
he
had
heard
before
but
i
wrote
to
you
he
said
did
you
get
my
letter
a
flicker
passed
across
the
vagrant
face
he
drew
the
letter
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
out
here
it
is
shelton
stared
at
it
surely
said
he
i
sent
a
cheque
ferrand
did
not
smile
there
was
a
look
about
him
as
though
shelton
by
forgetting
to
enclose
that
cheque
had
done
him
a
real
injury
shelton
could
not
quite
hide
a
glance
of
doubt
of
course
he
said
i
i
meant
to
enclose
a
too
subtle
to
say
anything
ferrand
curled
his
lip
i
am
capable
of
much
but
not
of
that
he
seemed
to
say
and
at
once
shelton
felt
the
meanness
of
his
doubt
stupid
of
me
he
said
i
had
no
intention
of
intruding
here
said
ferrand
i
hoped
to
see
you
in
the
neighbourhood
but
i
arrive
exhausted
with
fatigue
eaten
nothing
since
yesterday
at
noon
and
walked
thirty
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
see
i
had
no
time
to
lose
before
assuring
myself
whether
you
were
here
or
of
course
began
shelton
but
again
he
stopped
i
should
very
much
like
the
young
foreigner
went
on
for
one
of
your
good
legislators
to
find
himself
in
these
country
villages
with
a
penny
in
his
pocket
in
other
countries
bakers
are
obliged
to
sell
you
an
equivalent
of
bread
for
a
penny
here
they
wo
sell
you
as
much
as
a
crust
under
twopence
you
do
encourage
what
is
your
idea
now
asked
shelton
trying
to
gain
time
as
i
told
you
replied
ferrand
there
nothing
to
be
done
at
folkestone
though
i
should
have
stayed
there
if
i
had
had
the
money
to
defray
certain
expenses
and
again
he
seemed
to
reproach
his
patron
with
the
omission
of
that
cheque
they
say
things
will
certainly
be
better
at
the
end
of
the
month
now
that
i
know
english
well
i
thought
perhaps
i
could
procure
a
situation
for
teaching
i
see
said
shelton
as
a
fact
however
he
was
far
from
seeing
he
literally
did
not
know
what
to
do
it
seemed
so
brutal
to
give
ferrand
money
and
ask
him
to
clear
out
besides
he
chanced
to
have
none
in
his
pocket
it
needs
philosophy
to
support
what
i
gone
through
this
week
said
ferrand
shrugging
his
shoulders
on
wednesday
last
when
i
received
your
letter
i
had
just
and
at
once
i
made
a
resolution
to
come
and
see
you
on
that
sum
i
done
the
journey
my
strength
is
nearly
at
an
shelton
stroked
his
chin
well
he
had
just
begun
we
must
think
it
over
when
by
face
he
saw
that
some
one
had
come
in
he
turned
and
saw
antonia
in
the
doorway
excuse
me
he
stammered
and
going
to
antonia
drew
her
from
the
room
with
a
smile
she
said
at
once
it
the
young
foreigner
i
certain
oh
what
fun
yes
answered
shelton
slowly
he
come
to
see
me
about
getting
some
sort
of
tutorship
or
other
do
you
think
your
mother
would
mind
if
i
took
him
up
to
have
a
wash
he
had
a
longish
walk
and
might
he
have
some
breakfast
he
must
be
of
course
i
tell
dobson
shall
i
speak
to
mother
he
looks
nice
he
gave
her
a
grateful
furtive
look
and
went
back
to
his
guest
an
impulse
had
made
him
hide
from
her
the
true
condition
of
affairs
ferrand
was
standing
where
he
had
been
left
his
face
still
clothed
in
mordant
impassivity
come
up
to
my
room
said
shelton
and
while
his
guest
was
washing
brushing
and
otherwise
embellishing
his
person
he
stood
reflecting
that
ferrand
was
by
no
means
unpresentable
and
he
felt
quite
grateful
to
him
he
took
an
opportunity
when
the
young
man
back
was
turned
of
examining
his
counterfoils
there
was
no
record
naturally
of
a
cheque
drawn
in
ferrand
favour
shelton
felt
more
mean
than
ever
a
message
came
from
dennant
so
he
took
the
traveller
to
the
and
left
him
there
while
he
himself
went
to
the
lady
of
the
house
he
met
antonia
coming
down
how
many
days
did
you
say
he
went
without
food
that
time
you
know
she
asked
in
passing
he
does
look
a
bit
common
shelton
gazed
at
her
dubiously
they
surely
not
going
to
make
a
show
of
him
he
thought
dennant
was
writing
in
a
dress
starred
over
with
white
spots
whose
fine
lawn
collar
was
threaded
with
black
velvet
have
you
seen
the
new
hybrid
algy
brought
me
back
from
kidstone
is
it
and
she
bent
her
face
towards
this
perfect
rose
they
say
unique
i
awfully
interested
to
find
out
if
that
true
i
told
algy
i
really
must
have
shelton
thought
of
the
unique
hybrid
breakfasting
downstairs
he
wished
that
dennant
would
show
in
him
the
interest
she
had
manifested
in
the
rose
but
this
was
absurd
of
him
he
knew
for
the
potent
law
of
hobbies
controlled
the
upper
classes
forcing
them
to
take
more
interest
in
birds
and
roses
missionaries
or
limited
and
editions
of
old
books
things
in
a
word
in
treating
which
you
knew
exactly
where
you
were
than
in
the
manifestations
of
mere
life
that
came
before
their
eyes
oh
dick
about
that
young
frenchman
antonia
says
he
wants
a
tutorship
now
can
you
really
recommend
him
there
robinson
at
the
gateways
wants
someone
to
teach
her
boys
languages
and
if
he
were
quite
satisfactory
it
really
time
toddles
had
a
few
lessons
in
french
he
goes
to
eton
next
shelton
stared
at
the
rose
he
had
suddenly
realised
why
it
was
that
people
take
more
interest
in
roses
than
in
human
beings
one
could
do
it
with
a
quiet
heart
he
not
a
frenchman
you
know
he
said
to
gain
a
little
time
he
not
a
german
i
hope
dennant
answered
passing
her
forgers
round
a
petal
to
impress
its
fashion
on
her
brain
i
do
like
germans
is
he
the
one
you
wrote
about
come
down
in
the
world
such
a
pity
with
so
young
a
fellow
his
father
was
a
merchant
i
think
you
told
us
antonia
says
he
quite
refined
to
look
oh
yes
said
shelton
feeling
on
safe
ground
he
refined
enough
to
look
dennant
took
the
rose
and
put
it
to
her
nose
delicious
perfume
that
was
a
very
touchin
story
about
his
without
food
in
paris
old
hopkins
has
a
room
to
let
i
should
like
to
do
her
a
good
turn
i
afraid
there
a
hole
in
the
ceilin
though
or
there
the
room
here
in
the
left
wing
on
the
where
john
the
footman
used
to
sleep
it
quite
nice
perhaps
he
could
have
you
awfully
kind
said
shelton
but
i
should
like
to
do
something
to
restore
his
went
on
dennant
if
as
you
say
he
clever
and
all
that
seein
a
little
refined
life
again
might
make
a
world
of
difference
to
him
so
sad
when
a
young
man
loses
shelton
was
much
struck
by
the
practical
way
in
which
she
looked
at
things
restore
his
it
seemed
quite
a
splendid
notion
he
smiled
and
said
you
too
kind
i
think
i
do
believe
in
doin
things
by
halves
said
dennant
he
does
drink
i
suppose
oh
no
said
shelton
he
rather
a
tobacco
maniac
of
well
that
a
mercy
you
would
believe
the
trouble
i
had
with
drink
especially
over
cooks
and
coachmen
and
now
bunyan
taken
to
oh
you
have
no
trouble
with
ferrand
returned
shelton
you
could
tell
him
from
a
gentleman
as
far
as
manners
dennant
smiled
one
of
her
rather
sweet
and
kindly
smiles
my
dear
dick
she
said
there
not
much
comfort
in
that
look
at
poor
bobby
surcingle
look
at
oliver
semples
and
victor
medallion
you
could
have
better
families
but
if
you
sure
he
does
drink
algy
laugh
of
course
that
does
matter
he
laughs
at
shelton
felt
guilty
being
quite
unprepared
for
so
rapid
an
adoption
of
his
client
i
really
believe
there
a
lot
of
good
in
him
he
stammered
but
of
course
i
know
very
little
and
from
what
he
tells
me
he
had
a
very
curious
life
i
should
like
where
was
he
educated
inquired
dennant
they
have
no
public
schools
in
france
so
i
been
told
but
of
course
he
ca
help
that
poor
young
fellow
oh
and
dick
there
one
thing
has
he
relations
one
has
always
to
be
so
careful
about
that
it
one
thing
to
help
a
young
fellow
but
quite
another
to
help
his
family
too
one
sees
so
many
cases
of
that
where
men
marry
girls
without
money
you
he
has
told
me
answered
shelton
his
only
relations
are
some
cousins
and
they
are
dennant
took
out
her
handkerchief
and
bending
above
the
rose
removed
a
tiny
insect
these
get
in
everywhere
she
said
very
sad
story
ca
they
do
anything
for
him
and
she
made
researches
in
the
rose
heart
he
quarrelled
with
them
i
believe
said
shelton
i
have
liked
to
press
him
about
no
of
course
not
assented
dennant
absently
she
had
found
another
i
always
think
it
painful
when
a
young
man
seems
so
shelton
was
silent
he
was
thinking
deeply
he
had
never
before
felt
so
distrustful
of
the
youthful
foreigner
i
think
he
said
at
last
the
best
thing
would
be
for
you
to
see
him
for
very
well
said
dennant
i
should
be
so
glad
if
you
would
tell
him
to
come
up
i
must
say
i
do
think
that
was
a
most
touchin
story
about
paris
i
wonder
whether
this
light
strong
enough
now
for
me
to
photograph
this
shelton
withdrew
and
went
ferrand
was
still
at
breakfast
antonia
stood
at
the
sideboard
carving
beef
for
him
and
in
the
window
sat
thea
with
her
persian
kitten
both
girls
were
following
the
traveller
movements
with
inscrutable
blue
eyes
a
shiver
ran
down
shelton
spine
to
speak
truth
he
cursed
the
young
man
coming
as
though
it
affected
his
relations
with
antonia
chapter
xxvii
sub
rosa
from
the
interview
which
shelton
had
the
mixed
delight
of
watching
between
ferrand
and
the
honourable
dennant
certain
definite
results
accrued
the
chief
of
which
was
the
permission
accorded
the
young
wanderer
to
occupy
the
room
which
had
formerly
been
tenanted
by
the
footman
john
shelton
was
lost
in
admiration
of
ferrand
manner
in
this
its
subtle
combination
of
deference
and
dignity
was
almost
paralysing
paralysing
too
the
subterranean
smile
upon
his
lips
charmin
young
man
dick
said
dennant
when
shelton
lingered
to
say
once
more
that
he
knew
but
very
little
of
him
i
shall
send
a
note
round
to
robinson
at
once
they
rather
common
you
know
the
robinsons
i
think
they
take
anyone
i
i
sure
they
will
said
shelton
that
why
i
think
you
ought
to
know
but
dennant
eyes
fervent
were
fixed
on
something
far
away
turning
he
saw
the
rose
in
a
tall
vase
on
a
tall
and
spindly
stool
it
seemed
to
nod
towards
them
in
the
sunshine
dennant
dived
her
nose
towards
her
camera
the
light
perfect
now
she
said
in
a
voice
muffled
by
the
cloth
i
feel
sure
that
livin
with
decent
people
will
do
wonders
for
him
of
course
he
understands
that
his
meals
will
be
served
to
him
shelton
doubly
anxious
now
that
his
efforts
had
lodged
his
client
in
a
place
of
trust
fell
back
on
hoping
for
the
best
his
instinct
told
him
that
vagabond
as
ferrand
was
he
had
a
curious
that
would
save
him
from
a
mean
ingratitude
in
fact
as
dennant
who
was
by
no
means
void
of
foresaw
the
arrangement
worked
all
right
ferrand
entered
on
his
duties
as
french
tutor
to
the
little
robinsons
in
the
dennants
household
he
kept
himself
to
his
own
room
which
day
and
night
he
perfumed
with
tobacco
emerging
at
noon
into
the
garden
or
if
wet
into
the
study
to
teach
young
toddles
french
after
a
time
it
became
customary
for
him
to
lunch
with
the
partly
through
a
mistake
of
toddles
who
seemed
to
think
that
it
was
natural
and
partly
through
john
noble
one
of
shelton
friends
who
had
come
to
stay
and
discovered
ferrand
to
be
a
most
awfully
interesting
person
he
was
always
indeed
discovering
the
most
awfully
interesting
persons
in
his
grave
and
toneless
voice
brushing
his
hair
from
off
his
brow
he
descanted
upon
ferrand
with
enthusiasm
to
which
was
joined
a
kind
of
shocked
amusement
as
who
should
say
of
course
i
know
it
very
odd
but
really
he
such
an
awfully
interesting
for
john
noble
was
a
politician
belonging
to
one
of
those
two
peculiar
parties
which
thoroughly
in
earnest
of
an
honesty
above
suspicion
and
always
very
busy
are
constitutionally
averse
to
anything
peculiar
for
fear
of
finding
they
have
overstepped
the
limit
of
what
is
practical
in
politics
as
such
he
inspired
confidence
not
caring
for
things
unless
he
saw
some
immediate
benefit
to
be
had
from
them
having
a
perfect
sense
of
decency
and
a
small
imagination
he
discussed
all
sorts
of
things
with
ferrand
on
one
occasion
shelton
overheard
them
arguing
on
anarchism
no
englishman
approves
of
murder
noble
was
saying
in
the
gloomy
voice
that
contrasted
with
the
optimistic
cast
of
his
fine
head
but
the
main
principle
is
right
equalisation
of
property
is
bound
to
come
i
sympathise
with
then
not
with
their
forgive
me
struck
in
ferrand
do
you
know
any
anarchists
no
returned
noble
i
certainly
do
you
say
you
sympathise
with
them
but
the
first
time
it
comes
to
action
well
oh
monsieur
one
does
make
anarchism
with
the
shelton
perceived
that
he
had
meant
to
add
but
with
the
heart
the
lungs
the
he
drew
a
deeper
meaning
from
the
saying
and
seemed
to
see
curling
with
the
smoke
from
ferrand
lips
the
words
what
do
you
an
english
gentleman
of
excellent
position
and
all
the
prejudices
of
your
class
know
about
us
outcasts
if
you
want
to
understand
us
you
must
be
an
outcast
too
we
are
not
playing
at
the
this
talk
took
place
upon
the
lawn
at
the
end
of
one
of
french
lessons
and
shelton
left
john
noble
maintaining
to
the
youthful
foreigner
with
stubborn
logic
that
he
john
noble
and
the
anarchists
had
much
in
common
he
was
returning
to
the
house
when
someone
called
his
name
from
underneath
the
holm
oak
there
sitting
turkish
fashion
on
the
grass
a
pipe
between
his
teeth
he
found
a
man
who
had
arrived
the
night
before
and
impressed
him
by
his
friendly
taciturnity
his
name
was
whyddon
and
he
had
just
returned
from
central
africa
a
man
with
small
but
good
and
steady
eyes
and
strong
spare
figure
oh
shelton
he
said
i
wondered
if
you
could
tell
me
what
tips
i
ought
to
give
the
servants
here
after
ten
years
away
i
forgotten
all
about
that
sort
of
shelton
sat
down
beside
him
unconsciously
assuming
too
a
attitude
which
caused
him
much
discomfort
i
was
listening
said
his
new
acquaintance
to
the
little
chap
learning
his
french
i
forgotten
mine
one
feels
a
hopeless
duffer
knowing
no
i
suppose
you
speak
arabic
said
shelton
oh
arabic
and
a
dialect
or
two
they
do
count
that
tutor
has
a
curious
you
think
so
said
shelton
interested
he
had
a
curious
the
traveller
spread
his
hands
palms
downwards
on
the
grass
and
looked
at
shelton
with
a
smile
i
should
say
he
was
a
rolling
stone
he
said
it
odd
i
ve
seen
white
men
in
central
africa
with
a
good
deal
of
his
look
about
them
your
diagnosis
is
a
good
one
answered
shelton
i
always
sorry
for
those
fellows
there
generally
some
good
in
them
they
are
their
own
enemies
a
bad
business
to
be
unable
to
take
pride
in
anything
one
does
and
there
was
a
look
of
pity
on
his
face
that
exactly
it
said
shelton
i
often
tried
to
put
it
into
words
is
it
incurable
i
think
can
you
tell
me
why
whyddon
pondered
i
rather
think
he
said
at
last
it
must
be
because
they
have
too
strong
a
faculty
of
criticism
you
ca
teach
a
man
to
be
proud
of
his
own
work
that
lies
in
his
blood
folding
his
arms
across
his
breast
he
heaved
a
sigh
under
the
dark
foliage
his
eyes
on
the
sunlight
he
was
the
type
of
all
those
englishmen
who
keep
their
spirits
bright
and
wear
their
bodies
out
in
the
dark
places
of
hard
work
you
think
he
said
showing
his
teeth
in
a
smile
how
delightful
it
is
to
be
at
home
you
learn
to
love
the
old
country
when
you
away
from
shelton
often
thought
afterwards
of
this
diagnosis
of
the
vagabond
for
he
was
always
stumbling
on
instances
of
that
power
of
subtle
criticism
which
was
the
young
foreigner
prime
claim
to
be
a
most
awfully
interesting
and
perhaps
a
rather
shocking
person
an
old
of
shelton
and
his
wife
were
staying
in
the
house
who
offered
to
the
eye
the
picture
of
a
perfect
domesticity
passionless
and
smiling
it
was
impossible
to
imagine
they
could
ever
have
a
difference
shelton
whose
bedroom
was
next
to
theirs
could
hear
them
in
the
mornings
talking
in
exactly
the
tones
they
used
at
lunch
and
laughing
the
same
laughs
their
life
seemed
to
accord
them
perfect
satisfaction
they
were
supplied
with
their
convictions
by
society
just
as
when
at
home
they
were
supplied
with
all
the
other
necessaries
of
life
by
some
stores
their
fairly
handsome
faces
with
the
fairly
kind
expressions
quickly
and
carefully
regulated
by
a
sense
of
compromise
began
to
worry
him
so
much
that
when
in
the
same
room
he
would
even
read
to
avoid
the
need
of
looking
at
them
and
yet
they
were
kind
that
is
fairly
kind
and
clean
and
quiet
in
the
house
except
when
they
laughed
which
was
often
and
at
things
which
made
him
want
to
howl
as
a
dog
howls
at
music
mr
shelton
ferrand
said
one
day
i
not
an
amateur
of
marriage
never
had
the
chance
as
you
may
well
suppose
but
in
any
case
you
have
some
people
in
the
house
who
would
make
me
mark
time
before
i
went
committing
it
they
seem
the
ideal
young
married
people
do
quarrel
have
perfect
health
agree
with
everybody
go
to
church
have
children
but
i
should
like
to
hear
what
is
beautiful
in
their
life
and
he
grimaced
it
seems
to
me
so
ugly
that
i
can
only
gasp
i
would
much
rather
they
each
other
just
to
show
they
had
the
corner
of
a
soul
between
them
if
that
is
marriage
garde
but
shelton
did
not
answer
he
was
thinking
deeply
the
saying
of
john
noble
he
really
a
most
interesting
person
grew
more
and
more
upon
his
nerves
it
seemed
to
describe
the
dennant
attitude
towards
this
stranger
within
their
gates
they
treated
him
with
a
sort
of
wonder
on
the
do
touch
system
like
an
object
in
an
exhibition
the
restoration
however
of
his
proceeded
with
success
for
all
the
semblance
of
having
grown
too
big
for
shelton
clothes
for
all
his
vividly
burnt
face
and
the
quick
but
guarded
play
of
cynicism
on
his
lips
he
did
much
credit
to
his
patrons
he
had
subdued
his
terror
of
a
razor
and
looked
well
in
a
suit
of
shelton
flannels
for
after
all
he
had
only
been
eight
years
exiled
from
gentility
and
he
had
been
a
waiter
half
that
time
but
shelton
wished
him
at
the
devil
not
for
his
manners
sake
he
was
never
tired
of
watching
how
subtly
the
vagabond
adapted
his
conduct
to
the
conduct
of
his
hosts
while
keeping
up
his
critical
detachment
but
because
that
critical
detachment
was
a
constant
spur
to
his
own
vision
compelling
him
to
analyse
the
life
into
which
he
had
been
born
and
was
about
to
marry
this
process
was
disturbing
and
to
find
out
when
it
had
commenced
he
had
to
go
back
to
his
meeting
with
ferrand
on
the
journey
up
from
dover
there
was
kindness
in
a
hospitality
which
opened
to
so
strange
a
bird
admitting
the
kindness
shelton
fell
to
analysing
it
to
himself
to
people
of
his
class
the
use
of
kindness
was
a
luxury
not
significant
of
sacrifice
but
productive
of
a
pleasant
feeling
in
the
heart
such
as
massage
will
setup
in
the
legs
everybody
kind
he
thought
the
question
is
what
understanding
is
there
what
real
sympathy
this
problem
gave
him
food
for
thought
the
progress
which
dennant
not
unfrequently
remarked
upon
in
ferrand
conquest
of
his
strange
position
seemed
to
shelton
but
a
sign
that
he
was
getting
what
he
could
out
of
his
sudden
visit
to
green
pastures
under
the
same
circumstances
shelton
thought
that
he
himself
would
do
the
same
he
felt
that
the
young
foreigner
was
making
a
convenient
bow
to
property
but
he
had
more
respect
for
the
sarcastic
smile
on
the
lips
of
ferrand
heart
it
was
not
long
before
the
inevitable
change
came
in
the
spirit
of
the
situation
more
and
more
was
shelton
conscious
of
a
quaint
uneasiness
in
the
very
breathing
of
the
household
curious
fellow
you
got
hold
of
there
shelton
dennant
said
to
him
during
a
game
of
croquet
he
never
do
any
good
for
himself
in
one
sense
i
afraid
not
admitted
shelton
do
you
know
his
story
i
will
bet
you
sixpence
and
dennant
paused
to
swing
his
mallet
with
a
proper
accuracy
that
he
been
in
prison
ejaculated
shelton
i
think
said
dennant
with
bent
knees
carefully
measuring
his
next
shot
that
you
ought
to
make
inquiries
ah
missed
it
awkward
these
hoops
one
must
draw
the
line
i
never
could
draw
returned
shelton
nettled
and
uneasy
but
i
understand
i
give
him
a
hint
to
do
said
dennant
moving
after
his
second
ball
which
shelton
had
smitten
to
the
farther
end
be
offended
my
dear
shelton
and
by
no
means
give
him
a
hint
he
interests
me
very
much
a
very
clever
quiet
young
that
this
was
not
his
private
view
shelton
inferred
by
studying
dennant
manner
in
the
presence
of
the
vagabond
underlying
the
banter
of
the
tranquil
voice
the
guarded
quizzicality
of
his
pale
brown
face
it
could
be
seen
that
algernon
cuffe
dennant
accustomed
to
laugh
at
other
people
suspected
that
he
was
being
laughed
at
what
more
natural
than
that
he
should
grope
about
to
see
how
this
could
be
a
vagrant
alien
was
making
himself
felt
by
an
english
justice
of
the
peace
no
small
tribute
this
to
ferrand
personality
the
latter
would
sit
silent
through
a
meal
and
yet
make
his
effect
he
the
object
of
their
kindness
education
patronage
inspired
their
fear
there
was
no
longer
any
doubt
it
was
not
of
ferrand
that
they
were
afraid
but
of
what
they
did
not
understand
in
him
of
horrid
subtleties
meandering
in
the
brain
under
that
straight
hair
of
something
bizarre
popping
from
the
curving
lips
below
that
thin
lopsided
nose
but
to
shelton
in
this
as
in
all
else
antonia
was
what
mattered
at
first
anxious
to
show
her
lover
that
she
trusted
him
she
seemed
never
tired
of
doing
things
for
his
young
protege
as
though
she
too
had
set
her
heart
on
his
salvation
but
watching
her
eyes
when
they
rested
on
the
vagabond
shelton
was
perpetually
reminded
of
her
saying
on
the
first
day
of
his
visit
to
holm
oaks
i
suppose
he
really
good
i
mean
all
these
things
you
told
me
about
were
only
curiosity
never
left
her
glance
nor
did
that
story
of
his
four
starving
leave
her
mind
a
sentimental
picturesqueness
clung
about
that
incident
more
valuable
by
far
than
this
mere
human
being
with
whom
she
had
so
strangely
come
in
contact
she
watched
ferrand
and
shelton
watched
her
if
he
had
been
told
that
he
was
watching
her
he
would
have
denied
it
in
good
faith
but
he
was
bound
to
watch
her
to
find
out
with
what
eyes
she
viewed
this
visitor
who
embodied
all
the
rebellious
of
life
all
that
was
absent
in
herself
dick
she
said
to
him
one
day
you
never
talk
to
me
of
monsieur
do
you
want
to
talk
of
him
do
you
think
that
he
improved
he
antonia
looked
grave
no
but
really
i
do
know
said
shelton
i
ca
judge
antonia
turned
her
face
away
and
something
in
her
attitude
alarmed
him
he
was
once
a
sort
of
gentleman
she
said
why
should
he
become
one
again
sitting
on
the
low
wall
of
the
her
head
was
framed
by
golden
plums
the
sun
lay
barred
behind
the
foliage
of
the
holm
oak
but
a
little
patch
filtering
through
a
gap
had
rested
in
the
heart
it
crowned
the
girl
her
raiment
the
dark
leaves
the
red
wall
the
golden
plums
were
woven
by
the
passing
glow
to
a
block
of
pagan
colour
and
her
face
above
it
chaste
serene
was
like
the
scentless
summer
evening
a
bird
amongst
the
currant
bushes
kept
a
little
chant
vibrating
and
all
the
shape
and
colour
seemed
alive
perhaps
he
does
want
to
be
a
gentleman
said
shelton
antonia
swung
her
foot
how
can
he
help
wanting
to
he
may
have
a
different
philosophy
of
antonia
was
slow
to
answer
i
know
nothing
about
philosophies
of
life
she
said
at
last
shelton
answered
coldly
no
two
people
have
the
with
the
falling
the
charm
passed
off
the
tree
chilled
and
harder
yet
less
deep
it
was
no
more
a
block
of
woven
colour
warm
and
impassive
like
a
southern
goddess
it
was
now
a
northern
tree
with
a
grey
light
through
its
leaves
i
do
understand
you
in
the
least
she
said
everyone
wishes
to
be
and
safe
asked
shelton
gently
antonia
stared
suppose
he
said
i
do
pretend
to
know
i
only
suppose
what
ferrand
really
cares
for
is
doing
things
differently
from
other
people
if
you
were
to
load
him
with
a
character
and
give
him
money
on
condition
that
he
acted
as
we
all
act
do
you
think
he
would
accept
it
why
not
why
are
cats
dogs
or
pagans
christians
antonia
slid
down
from
the
wall
you
do
seem
to
think
there
any
use
in
trying
she
said
and
turned
away
shelton
made
a
movement
as
if
he
would
go
after
her
and
then
stood
still
watching
her
figure
slowly
pass
her
head
outlined
above
the
wall
her
hands
turned
back
across
her
narrow
hips
she
halted
at
the
bend
looked
back
then
with
an
impatient
gesture
disappeared
antonia
was
slipping
from
him
a
moment
vision
from
without
himself
would
have
shown
him
that
it
was
he
who
moved
and
she
who
was
standing
still
like
the
figure
of
one
watching
the
passage
of
a
stream
with
clear
direct
and
sullen
eyes
chapter
xxviii
the
river
one
day
towards
the
end
of
august
shelton
took
antonia
on
the
river
the
river
that
like
soft
music
soothes
the
land
the
river
of
the
reeds
and
poplars
the
silver
sun
and
moon
woods
and
the
white
slumbrous
clouds
where
cuckoos
and
the
wind
the
pigeons
and
the
weirs
are
always
singing
and
in
the
flash
of
naked
bodies
the
play
of
waterlily
leaves
queer
goblin
stumps
and
the
twilight
faces
of
the
twisted
pan
lives
once
more
the
reach
which
shelton
chose
was
innocent
of
launches
champagne
bottles
and
loud
laughter
it
was
uncivilised
and
seldom
troubled
by
these
humanising
influences
he
paddled
slowly
silent
and
absorbed
watching
antonia
an
unaccustomed
languor
clung
about
her
her
eyes
had
shadows
as
though
she
had
not
slept
colour
glowed
softly
in
her
cheeks
her
frock
seemed
all
alight
with
golden
radiance
she
made
shelton
pull
into
the
reeds
and
plucked
two
rounded
lilies
sailing
like
ships
against
water
pull
into
the
shade
please
she
said
it
too
hot
out
the
brim
of
her
linen
hat
kept
the
sun
from
her
face
but
her
head
was
drooping
like
a
flower
head
at
noon
shelton
saw
that
the
heat
was
really
harming
her
as
too
hot
a
day
will
dim
the
icy
freshness
of
a
northern
plant
he
dipped
his
sculls
the
ripples
started
out
and
swam
in
grave
diminuendo
till
they
touched
the
banks
he
shot
the
boat
into
a
cleft
and
caught
the
branches
of
an
overhanging
tree
the
skiff
rested
balancing
with
mutinous
vibration
like
a
living
thing
i
should
hate
to
live
in
london
said
antonia
suddenly
the
slums
must
be
so
awful
what
a
pity
when
there
are
places
like
this
but
no
good
no
answered
shelton
slowly
i
suppose
it
is
no
there
are
some
bad
cottages
at
the
lower
end
of
cross
eaton
i
went
them
one
day
with
miss
truecote
the
people
wo
help
themselves
so
discouraging
to
help
people
who
wo
help
she
was
leaning
her
elbows
on
her
knees
and
with
her
chin
resting
on
her
hands
gazed
up
at
shelton
all
around
them
hung
a
tent
of
soft
thick
leaves
and
below
the
water
was
with
green
refraction
willow
boughs
swaying
above
the
boat
caressed
antonia
arms
and
shoulders
her
face
and
hair
alone
were
free
so
discouraging
she
said
again
a
silence
fell
antonia
seemed
thinking
deeply
doubts
do
help
you
she
said
suddenly
how
can
you
get
any
good
from
doubts
the
thing
is
to
win
victories
said
shelton
i
rather
understand
than
conquer
he
had
risen
to
his
feet
and
grasped
stunted
branch
canting
the
boat
towards
the
bank
how
can
you
let
things
slide
like
that
dick
it
like
have
you
such
a
bad
opinion
of
him
then
asked
shelton
he
felt
on
the
verge
of
some
discovery
she
buried
her
chin
deeper
in
her
hands
i
liked
him
at
first
she
said
i
thought
that
he
was
different
i
thought
he
could
really
be
really
be
what
antonia
did
not
answer
i
do
know
she
said
at
last
i
ca
explain
i
thought
shelton
still
stood
holding
to
the
branch
and
the
oscillation
of
the
boat
freed
an
infinity
of
tiny
ripples
you
thought
what
he
said
he
ought
to
have
seen
her
face
grow
younger
more
childish
even
timid
she
said
in
a
voice
smooth
round
and
young
you
know
dick
i
do
think
we
ought
to
try
i
know
i
do
try
half
hard
enough
it
does
do
any
good
to
think
when
you
think
everything
seems
so
mixed
as
if
there
were
nothing
to
lay
hold
of
i
do
so
hate
to
feel
like
that
it
is
as
if
we
did
know
what
right
sometimes
i
think
and
think
and
it
all
no
good
only
a
waste
of
time
and
you
feel
at
the
end
as
if
you
had
been
doing
shelton
frowned
what
has
been
through
fire
no
good
he
said
and
letting
go
the
branch
sat
down
freed
from
restraint
the
boat
edged
out
towards
the
current
but
what
about
ferrand
i
lay
awake
last
night
wondering
what
makes
you
like
him
so
he
so
bitter
he
makes
me
feel
unhappy
he
never
seems
content
with
anything
and
he
despises
her
face
hardened
i
mean
he
hates
us
all
so
should
i
if
i
were
he
said
shelton
the
boat
was
drifting
on
and
gleams
of
sunlight
chased
across
their
faces
antonia
spoke
again
he
seems
to
be
always
looking
at
dark
things
or
else
he
seems
as
if
as
if
he
could
enjoy
himself
too
much
i
thought
i
thought
at
first
she
stammered
that
we
could
do
him
do
him
good
ha
ha
a
startled
rat
went
swimming
for
its
life
against
the
stream
and
shelton
saw
that
he
had
done
a
dreadful
thing
he
had
let
antonia
with
a
jerk
into
a
secret
not
hitherto
admitted
even
by
himself
the
secret
that
her
eyes
were
not
his
eyes
her
way
of
seeing
things
not
his
nor
ever
would
be
he
quickly
muffled
up
his
laughter
antonia
had
dropped
her
gaze
her
face
regained
its
languor
but
the
bosom
of
her
dress
was
heaving
shelton
watched
her
racking
his
brains
to
find
excuses
for
that
fatal
laugh
none
could
he
find
it
was
a
little
piece
of
truth
he
paddled
slowly
on
close
to
the
bank
in
the
long
silence
of
the
river
the
breeze
had
died
away
not
a
fish
was
rising
save
for
the
lost
music
of
the
larks
no
birds
were
piping
alone
a
single
pigeon
at
brief
intervals
cooed
from
the
neighbouring
wood
they
did
not
stay
much
longer
in
the
boat
on
the
homeward
journey
in
the
rounding
a
corner
of
the
road
they
came
on
ferrand
in
his
holding
a
cigarette
between
his
fingers
and
talking
to
a
tramp
who
was
squatting
on
the
bank
the
young
foreigner
recognised
them
and
at
once
removed
his
hat
there
he
is
said
shelton
returning
the
salute
antonia
bowed
oh
she
cried
when
they
were
out
of
hearing
i
wish
he
go
i
ca
bear
to
see
him
it
like
looking
at
the
chapter
xxix
on
the
wing
that
night
having
gone
up
to
his
room
shelton
filled
his
pipe
for
his
unpleasant
duty
he
had
resolved
to
hint
to
ferrand
that
he
had
better
go
he
was
still
debating
whether
to
write
or
go
himself
to
the
young
foreigner
when
there
came
a
knock
and
ferrand
himself
appeared
i
should
be
sorry
he
said
breaking
an
awkward
silence
if
you
were
to
think
me
ungrateful
but
i
see
no
future
for
me
here
it
would
be
better
for
me
to
go
i
should
never
be
content
to
pass
my
life
in
teaching
languages
guere
dans
mon
as
soon
as
what
he
had
been
cudgelling
his
brains
to
find
a
way
of
saying
had
thus
been
said
for
him
shelton
experienced
a
sense
of
disapproval
what
do
you
expect
to
get
that
better
he
said
avoiding
eyes
thanks
to
your
kindness
replied
the
latter
i
find
myself
restored
i
feel
that
i
ought
to
make
some
good
efforts
to
dominate
my
social
i
should
think
it
well
over
if
i
were
you
said
shelton
i
have
and
it
seems
to
me
that
i
wasting
my
time
for
a
man
with
any
courage
languages
are
no
career
and
though
i
many
defects
i
still
have
shelton
let
his
pipe
go
out
so
pathetic
seemed
to
him
this
young
faith
in
his
career
it
was
no
pretended
faith
but
neither
was
it
he
felt
his
true
motive
for
departure
he
tired
he
thought
that
it
tired
of
one
and
having
the
instinctive
sense
that
nothing
would
keep
ferrand
he
redoubled
his
advice
i
should
have
thought
he
said
that
you
would
have
done
better
to
have
held
on
here
and
saved
a
little
before
going
off
to
god
knows
to
save
said
ferrand
is
impossible
for
me
but
thanks
to
you
and
your
good
friends
i
enough
to
make
front
to
first
necessities
i
in
correspondence
with
a
friend
it
of
great
importance
for
me
to
reach
paris
before
all
the
world
returns
i
a
chance
to
get
a
post
in
one
of
the
west
african
companies
one
makes
fortunes
out
there
if
one
survives
and
as
you
know
i
do
set
too
much
store
by
we
have
a
proverb
said
shelton
bird
in
the
hand
is
worth
two
birds
in
the
bush
that
returned
ferrand
like
all
proverbs
is
just
half
true
this
is
an
affair
of
temperament
it
not
in
my
character
to
dandle
one
when
i
see
two
waiting
to
be
caught
apprendre
plus
fort
que
he
paused
then
with
a
nervous
goggle
of
the
eyes
and
an
ironic
smile
he
said
besides
cher
monsieur
it
is
better
that
i
go
i
have
never
been
one
to
hug
illusions
and
i
see
pretty
clearly
that
my
presence
is
hardly
acceptable
in
this
what
makes
you
say
that
asked
shelton
feeling
that
the
murder
was
now
my
dear
sir
all
the
world
has
not
your
understanding
and
your
lack
of
prejudice
and
though
your
friends
have
been
extremely
kind
to
me
i
am
in
a
false
position
i
cause
them
embarrassment
which
is
not
extraordinary
when
you
reflect
what
i
have
been
and
that
they
know
my
not
through
me
said
shelton
quickly
for
i
do
know
it
it
enough
the
vagrant
said
that
they
feel
i
not
a
bird
of
their
feather
they
can
not
change
neither
can
i
have
never
wanted
to
remain
where
i
not
shelton
turned
to
the
window
and
stared
into
the
darkness
he
would
never
quite
understand
this
vagabond
so
delicate
so
cynical
and
he
wondered
if
ferrand
had
been
swallowing
down
the
words
why
even
you
wo
be
sorry
to
see
my
back
well
he
said
at
last
if
you
must
go
you
must
when
do
you
start
i
arranged
with
a
man
to
carry
my
things
to
the
early
train
i
think
it
better
not
to
say
i
written
a
letter
instead
here
it
is
i
left
it
open
for
you
to
read
if
you
should
then
said
shelton
with
a
curious
mingling
of
relief
regret
i
see
you
again
ferrand
gave
his
hand
a
stealthy
rub
and
held
it
out
i
shall
never
forget
what
you
have
done
for
me
he
said
mind
you
write
said
shelton
yes
yes
the
vagrant
face
was
oddly
twisted
you
do
know
what
a
difference
it
makes
to
have
a
correspondent
it
gives
one
courage
i
hope
to
remain
a
long
time
in
correspondence
with
i
dare
say
you
do
thought
shelton
grimly
with
a
certain
queer
emotion
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
i
have
never
asked
you
for
anything
said
ferrand
thank
you
a
thousand
times
he
again
wrung
his
patron
hand
in
his
damp
grasp
and
going
out
left
shelton
with
an
odd
sensation
in
his
throat
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
remember
that
i
have
never
asked
you
for
the
phrase
seemed
strange
and
his
mind
flew
back
over
all
this
queer
acquaintanceship
it
was
a
fact
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
the
youth
had
never
really
asked
for
anything
shelton
sat
down
on
his
bed
and
began
to
read
the
letter
in
his
hand
it
was
in
french
dear
madame
it
ran
it
will
be
insupportable
to
me
after
your
kindness
if
you
take
me
for
ungrateful
unfortunately
a
crisis
has
arrived
which
plunges
me
into
the
necessity
of
leaving
your
hospitality
in
all
lives
as
you
are
well
aware
there
arise
occasions
that
one
can
not
govern
and
i
know
that
you
will
pardon
me
that
i
enter
into
no
explanation
on
an
event
which
gives
me
great
chagrin
and
above
all
renders
me
subject
to
an
imputation
of
ingratitude
which
believe
me
dear
madame
by
no
means
lies
in
my
character
i
know
well
enough
that
it
is
a
breach
of
politeness
to
leave
you
without
in
person
conveying
the
expression
of
my
profound
reconnaissance
but
if
you
consider
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
be
compelled
to
abandon
all
that
is
so
distinguished
in
domestic
life
you
will
forgive
my
weakness
people
like
me
who
have
gone
through
existence
with
their
eyes
open
have
remarked
that
those
who
are
endowed
with
riches
have
a
right
to
look
down
on
such
as
are
not
by
wealth
and
breeding
fitted
to
occupy
the
same
position
i
shall
never
dispute
a
right
so
natural
and
salutary
seeing
that
without
this
distinction
this
superiority
which
makes
of
the
and
the
a
race
apart
the
rest
of
the
world
would
have
no
standard
by
which
to
rule
their
lives
no
anchor
to
throw
into
the
depths
of
that
vast
sea
of
fortune
and
of
misfortune
on
which
we
others
drive
before
the
wind
it
is
because
of
this
dear
madame
that
i
regard
myself
so
doubly
fortunate
to
have
been
able
for
a
few
minutes
in
this
bitter
pilgrimage
called
life
to
sit
beneath
the
tree
of
safety
to
have
been
able
if
only
for
an
hour
to
sit
and
set
the
pilgrims
pass
the
pilgrims
with
the
blistered
feet
and
ragged
clothes
and
who
yet
dear
madame
guard
within
their
hearts
a
certain
joy
in
life
illegal
joy
like
the
desert
air
which
travellers
will
tell
you
fills
men
as
with
wine
to
be
able
thus
to
sit
an
hour
and
with
a
smile
to
watch
them
pass
lame
and
blind
in
all
the
rags
of
their
deserved
misfortunes
can
you
not
conceive
dear
madame
how
that
must
be
for
such
as
i
a
comfort
whatever
one
may
say
it
is
sweet
from
a
position
of
security
to
watch
the
sufferings
of
others
it
gives
one
a
good
sensation
in
the
heart
in
writing
this
i
recollect
that
i
myself
once
had
the
chance
of
passing
all
my
life
in
this
enviable
safety
and
as
you
may
suppose
dear
madame
i
curse
myself
that
i
should
ever
have
had
the
courage
to
step
beyond
the
boundaries
of
this
fine
tranquil
state
yet
too
there
have
been
times
when
i
have
asked
myself
do
we
really
differ
from
the
wealthy
we
others
birds
of
the
fields
who
have
our
own
philosophy
grown
from
the
pains
of
needing
bread
we
who
see
that
the
human
heart
is
not
always
an
affair
of
figures
or
of
those
good
maxims
that
one
finds
in
do
we
really
differ
it
is
with
shame
that
i
confess
to
have
asked
myself
a
question
so
heretical
but
now
when
for
these
four
weeks
i
have
had
the
fortune
of
this
rest
beneath
your
roof
i
see
how
wrong
i
was
to
entertain
such
doubts
it
is
a
great
happiness
to
have
decided
once
for
all
this
point
for
it
is
not
in
my
character
to
pass
through
life
uncertain
mistaken
perhaps
on
psychological
matters
such
as
these
no
madame
rest
happily
assured
that
there
is
a
great
difference
which
in
the
future
will
be
sacred
for
me
for
believe
me
madame
it
would
be
calamity
for
high
society
if
by
chance
there
should
arise
amongst
them
any
understanding
of
all
that
side
of
life
which
vast
as
the
plains
and
bitter
as
the
sea
black
as
the
ashes
of
a
corpse
and
yet
more
free
than
any
wings
of
birds
who
fly
away
is
so
justly
beyond
the
grasp
of
their
philosophy
yes
believe
me
dear
madame
there
is
no
danger
in
the
world
so
much
to
be
avoided
by
all
the
members
of
that
circle
most
illustrious
most
respectable
called
high
society
from
what
i
have
said
you
may
imagine
how
hard
it
is
for
me
to
take
my
flight
i
shall
always
keep
for
you
the
most
distinguished
sentiments
with
the
expression
of
my
full
regard
for
you
and
your
good
family
and
of
a
gratitude
as
sincere
as
it
is
badly
worded
believe
me
dear
madame
your
devoted
louis
ferrand
shelton
first
impulse
was
to
tear
the
letter
up
but
this
he
reflected
he
had
no
right
to
do
remembering
too
that
dennant
french
was
orthodox
he
felt
sure
she
would
never
understand
the
young
subtle
innuendoes
he
closed
the
envelope
and
went
to
bed
haunted
still
by
ferrand
parting
look
it
was
with
no
small
feeling
of
embarrassment
however
that
having
sent
the
letter
to
its
destination
by
an
early
footman
he
made
his
appearance
at
the
behind
the
austrian
filled
with
french
coffee
dennant
who
had
placed
four
eggs
in
a
german
said
with
a
kindly
smile
dick
an
egg
she
asked
him
holding
up
a
fifth
no
thank
you
replied
shelton
greeting
the
table
and
fitting
down
he
was
a
little
late
the
buzz
of
conversation
rose
hilariously
around
my
dear
continued
dennant
who
was
talking
to
his
youngest
daughter
you
have
no
chance
whatever
not
the
least
little
bit
of
father
what
nonsense
you
know
we
shall
beat
your
heads
off
before
it
too
late
then
i
will
eat
a
muffin
shelton
pass
the
muffins
but
in
making
this
request
dennant
avoided
looking
in
his
face
antonia
too
seemed
to
keep
her
eyes
away
from
him
she
was
talking
to
a
connoisseur
on
art
of
supernatural
appearances
and
seemed
in
the
highest
spirits
shelton
rose
and
going
to
the
sideboard
helped
himself
to
grouse
who
was
the
young
man
i
saw
yesterday
on
the
lawn
he
heard
the
connoisseur
remark
struck
me
as
having
an
er
quite
intelligent
his
own
intelligent
physiog
raised
at
a
slight
slant
so
that
he
might
look
the
better
through
his
was
the
very
pattern
of
approval
it
curious
how
one
always
meeting
with
intelligence
it
seemed
to
say
dennant
paused
in
the
act
of
adding
cream
and
shelton
scrutinised
her
face
it
was
and
superior
as
ever
thank
goodness
she
had
smelt
no
rat
he
felt
strangely
disappointed
you
mean
monsieur
ferrand
teachin
toddles
french
dobson
the
professor
i
hope
i
shall
see
him
again
cooed
the
connoisseur
he
was
quite
interesting
on
the
subject
of
young
german
working
men
it
seems
they
tramp
from
place
to
place
to
learn
their
trades
what
nationality
was
he
may
i
ask
dennant
of
whom
he
asked
this
question
lifted
his
brows
and
said
ask
half
dutch
half
very
interesting
breed
i
hope
i
shall
see
him
well
you
wo
said
thea
suddenly
he
shelton
saw
that
their
good
breeding
alone
prevented
all
from
adding
and
thank
goodness
too
gone
dear
me
it
very
yes
said
dennant
very
now
algie
murmured
dennant
it
quite
a
charmin
letter
must
have
taken
the
poor
young
man
an
hour
to
oh
mother
cried
antonia
and
shelton
felt
his
face
go
crimson
he
had
suddenly
remembered
that
her
french
was
better
than
her
mother
he
seems
to
have
had
a
singular
experience
said
the
connoisseur
yes
echoed
dennant
he
had
some
singular
experience
if
you
want
to
know
the
details
ask
friend
shelton
it
quite
romantic
in
the
meantime
my
dear
another
cup
the
connoisseur
never
quite
devoid
of
malice
spurred
his
curiosity
to
a
further
effort
and
turning
his
eyes
on
shelton
murmured
well
shelton
you
are
the
historian
it
there
is
no
history
said
shelton
without
looking
up
ah
that
very
dull
remarked
the
connoisseur
my
dear
dick
said
dennant
that
was
really
a
most
story
about
his
goin
without
food
in
shelton
shot
another
look
at
antonia
her
face
was
frigid
i
hate
your
d
superiority
he
thought
staring
at
the
connoisseur
there
nothing
said
that
gentleman
more
enthralling
than
starvation
come
mr
i
ca
tell
stories
said
shelton
never
he
cared
not
a
straw
for
ferrand
his
coming
going
or
his
history
for
looking
at
antonia
his
heart
was
heavy
chapter
xxx
the
lady
from
beyond
the
morning
was
sultry
brooding
steamy
antonia
was
at
her
music
and
from
the
room
where
shelton
tried
to
fix
attention
on
a
book
he
could
hear
her
practising
her
scales
with
a
cold
fury
that
cast
an
added
gloom
upon
his
spirit
he
did
not
see
her
until
lunch
and
then
she
again
sat
next
the
connoisseur
her
cheeks
were
pale
but
there
was
something
feverish
in
her
chatter
to
her
neighbour
she
still
refused
to
look
at
shelton
he
felt
very
miserable
after
lunch
when
most
of
them
had
left
the
table
the
rest
fell
to
discussing
country
neighbours
of
course
said
dennant
there
are
the
foliots
but
nobody
calls
on
ah
said
the
connoisseur
the
foliots
the
foliots
the
people
er
who
quite
so
it
really
distressin
she
looks
so
sweet
ridin
about
many
people
with
worse
stories
get
called
on
continued
dennant
with
that
large
frankness
of
intrusion
upon
doubtful
subjects
which
may
be
made
by
certain
people
in
a
certain
way
but
after
all
one
could
ask
them
to
meet
no
the
connoisseur
assented
i
used
to
know
foliot
thousand
pities
they
say
she
was
a
very
pretty
oh
not
pretty
said
dennant
more
interestin
than
pretty
i
should
shelton
who
knew
the
lady
slightly
noticed
that
they
spoke
of
her
as
in
the
past
he
did
not
look
towards
antonia
for
though
a
little
troubled
at
her
presence
while
such
a
subject
was
discussed
he
hated
his
conviction
that
her
face
was
as
unruffled
as
though
the
foliots
had
been
a
separate
species
there
was
in
fact
a
curiosity
about
her
eyes
a
faint
impatience
on
her
lips
she
was
rolling
little
crumbs
of
bread
suddenly
yawning
she
muttered
some
remark
and
rose
shelton
stopped
her
at
the
door
where
are
you
going
for
a
may
i
come
she
shook
her
head
i
going
to
take
shelton
held
the
door
open
and
went
back
to
the
table
yes
the
connoisseur
said
sipping
at
his
sherry
i
afraid
all
over
with
young
such
a
pity
murmured
dennant
and
her
kindly
face
looked
quite
disturbed
i
known
him
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
of
course
i
think
he
made
a
great
mistake
to
bring
her
down
here
not
even
bein
able
to
get
married
makes
it
doubly
awkward
oh
i
think
he
made
a
great
mistake
ah
said
the
connoisseur
but
d
you
suppose
that
makes
much
difference
even
if
what
gave
her
a
divorce
i
do
think
do
you
know
that
oh
it
does
so
many
people
would
be
inclined
to
look
over
it
in
time
but
as
it
is
it
hopeless
quite
so
very
awkward
for
people
too
meetin
them
about
the
telfords
and
the
butterwicks
by
the
way
they
comin
here
to
dine
live
near
them
do
you
did
you
ever
meet
her
the
flood
the
connoisseur
inquired
and
his
lips
parting
and
unexpectedly
revealing
teeth
gave
him
a
shadowy
resemblance
to
a
goat
yes
i
did
meet
her
once
at
the
branksomes
i
thought
her
quite
a
charmin
poor
fellow
said
the
connoisseur
they
tell
me
he
was
going
to
take
the
and
there
are
his
delightful
coverts
too
algie
often
used
to
shoot
there
and
now
they
say
he
just
has
his
brother
down
to
shoot
with
him
it
really
quite
too
melancholy
did
you
know
him
dick
foliot
replied
shelton
absently
no
i
never
met
him
i
seen
her
once
or
twice
at
through
the
window
he
could
see
antonia
in
her
scarlet
swinging
her
stick
and
he
got
up
feigning
unconcern
just
then
toddles
came
bounding
up
against
his
sister
they
went
off
arm
in
arm
she
had
seen
him
at
the
window
yet
she
gave
no
friendly
glance
shelton
felt
more
miserable
than
ever
he
stepped
out
upon
the
drive
there
was
a
lurid
gloomy
canopy
above
the
drooped
their
heavy
blackish
green
the
wonted
rustle
of
the
was
gone
even
the
rooks
were
silent
a
store
of
force
lay
heavy
on
the
heart
of
nature
he
started
pacing
slowly
up
and
down
his
pride
forbidding
him
to
follow
her
and
presently
sat
down
on
an
old
stone
seat
that
faced
the
road
he
stayed
a
long
time
staring
at
the
elms
asking
himself
what
he
had
done
and
what
he
ought
to
do
and
somehow
he
was
frightened
a
sense
of
loneliness
was
on
him
so
real
so
painful
that
he
shivered
in
the
sweltering
heat
he
was
there
perhaps
an
hour
alone
and
saw
nobody
pass
along
the
road
then
came
the
sound
of
horse
hoofs
and
at
the
same
time
he
heard
a
approaching
from
the
opposite
direction
the
rider
made
appearance
first
riding
a
grey
horse
with
an
arab
high
set
head
and
tail
she
was
holding
him
with
difficulty
for
the
whirr
of
the
approaching
car
grew
every
moment
louder
shelton
rose
the
car
flashed
by
he
saw
the
horse
stagger
in
the
crushing
its
rider
up
against
the
gatepost
he
ran
but
before
he
reached
the
gate
the
lady
was
on
foot
holding
the
plunging
horse
bridle
are
you
hurt
cried
shelton
breathlessly
and
he
too
grabbed
the
bridle
those
beastly
cars
i
do
know
she
said
please
do
he
wo
let
strangers
touch
shelton
let
go
and
watched
her
coax
the
horse
she
was
rather
tall
dressed
in
a
grey
habit
with
a
grey
russian
cap
upon
her
head
and
he
suddenly
recognised
the
foliot
whom
they
had
been
talking
of
at
lunch
he
be
quiet
now
she
said
if
you
would
mind
holding
him
a
she
gave
the
reins
to
him
and
leaned
against
the
gate
she
was
very
pale
i
do
hope
he
has
hurt
you
shelton
said
he
was
quite
close
to
her
well
able
to
see
her
face
a
curious
face
with
high
and
a
flatfish
moulding
enigmatic
yet
strangely
passionate
for
all
its
listless
pallor
her
smiling
tightened
lips
were
pallid
pallid
too
her
grey
and
eyes
with
greenish
tints
above
all
pale
the
ashy
mass
of
hair
coiled
under
her
grey
cap
she
said
i
shall
be
all
right
directly
i
sorry
to
have
made
a
she
bit
her
lips
and
smiled
i
sure
you
hurt
do
let
me
go
for
stammered
shelton
i
can
easily
get
help
she
said
with
a
stony
little
laugh
oh
no
thanks
she
left
the
gate
and
crossed
the
road
to
where
he
held
the
horse
shelton
to
conceal
embarrassment
looked
at
the
horse
legs
and
noticed
that
the
grey
was
resting
one
of
them
he
ran
his
hand
down
i
afraid
he
said
your
horse
has
knocked
his
off
knee
she
smiled
again
then
we
both
he
be
lame
when
he
gets
cold
would
you
like
to
put
him
in
the
stable
here
i
sure
you
ought
to
drive
no
thanks
if
i
able
to
ride
him
he
can
carry
me
give
me
a
hand
her
voice
sounded
as
though
something
had
offended
her
rising
from
inspection
of
the
horse
leg
shelton
saw
antonia
and
toddles
standing
by
they
had
come
through
a
wicketgate
leading
from
the
fields
the
latter
ran
up
to
him
at
once
we
saw
it
he
whispered
jolly
ca
i
help
hold
his
bridle
answered
shelton
and
he
looked
from
one
lady
to
the
other
there
are
moments
when
the
expression
of
a
face
fixes
itself
with
painful
clearness
to
shelton
this
was
such
a
moment
those
two
faces
close
together
under
their
coverings
of
scarlet
and
of
grey
showed
a
contrast
almost
cruelly
vivid
antonia
was
flushed
her
eyes
had
grown
deep
blue
her
look
of
startled
doubt
had
passed
and
left
a
question
in
her
face
would
you
like
to
come
in
and
wait
we
could
send
you
home
in
the
brougham
she
said
the
lady
called
foliot
stood
one
arm
across
the
crupper
of
her
saddle
biting
her
lips
and
smiling
still
her
enigmatic
smile
and
it
was
her
face
that
stayed
most
vividly
on
shelton
mind
its
ashy
hail
its
pallor
and
fixed
scornful
eyes
oh
no
thanks
you
very
out
of
antonia
face
the
timid
doubting
friendliness
had
fled
and
was
replaced
by
enmity
with
a
long
cold
look
at
both
of
them
she
turned
away
foliot
gave
a
little
laugh
and
raised
her
foot
for
help
he
heard
a
hiss
of
pain
as
he
swung
her
up
but
when
he
looked
at
her
she
smiled
anyway
he
said
impatiently
let
me
come
and
see
you
do
break
she
shook
her
head
it
only
two
miles
i
not
made
of
then
i
shall
simply
have
to
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
fixing
her
resolute
eyes
on
him
would
that
boy
like
to
come
she
asked
toddles
left
the
horse
head
by
jove
he
cried
would
i
just
then
she
said
i
think
that
will
be
best
you
been
so
she
bowed
smiled
inscrutably
once
more
touched
the
arab
with
her
whip
and
started
toddles
trotting
at
her
side
shelton
was
left
with
antonia
underneath
the
elms
a
sudden
puff
of
tepid
air
blew
in
their
faces
like
a
warning
message
from
the
heavy
purple
heat
clouds
low
rumbling
thunder
travelled
slowly
from
afar
we
going
to
have
a
storm
he
said
antonia
nodded
she
was
pale
now
and
her
face
still
wore
its
cold
look
of
offence
i
got
a
headache
she
said
i
shall
go
in
and
lie
shelton
tried
to
speak
but
something
kept
him
silent
submission
to
what
was
coming
like
the
mute
submission
of
the
fields
and
birds
to
the
menace
of
the
storm
he
watched
her
go
and
went
back
to
his
seat
and
the
silence
seemed
to
grow
the
flowers
ceased
to
exude
their
fragrance
numbed
by
the
weighty
air
all
the
long
house
behind
him
seemed
asleep
deserted
no
noise
came
forth
no
laughter
the
echo
of
no
music
the
ringing
of
no
bell
the
heat
had
wrapped
it
round
with
drowsiness
and
the
silence
added
to
the
solitude
within
him
what
an
unlucky
chance
that
woman
accident
designed
by
providence
to
put
antonia
further
from
him
than
before
why
was
not
the
world
composed
of
the
immaculate
alone
he
started
pacing
up
and
down
tortured
by
a
dreadful
heartache
i
must
get
rid
of
this
he
thought
i
go
for
a
good
tramp
and
chance
the
leaving
the
drive
he
ran
on
toddles
returning
in
the
highest
spirits
i
saw
her
home
he
crowed
i
say
what
a
ripper
is
she
she
be
as
lame
as
a
tree
so
will
the
gee
jolly
hot
this
meeting
showed
shelton
that
he
had
been
an
hour
on
the
stone
seat
he
had
thought
it
some
ten
minutes
and
the
discovery
alarmed
him
it
seemed
to
bring
the
import
of
his
miserable
fear
right
home
to
him
he
started
with
a
swinging
stride
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
road
the
perspiration
streaming
down
his
face
chapter
xxxi
the
storm
it
was
seven
and
more
when
shelton
returned
from
his
walk
a
few
heat
drops
had
splashed
the
leaves
but
the
storm
had
not
yet
broken
in
brooding
silence
the
world
seemed
pent
beneath
the
purple
firmament
by
rapid
walking
in
the
heat
shelton
had
got
rid
of
his
despondency
he
felt
like
one
who
is
to
see
his
mistress
after
long
estrangement
he
bathed
and
straightening
his
stood
smiling
at
the
glass
his
fear
unhappiness
and
doubts
seemed
like
an
evil
dream
how
much
worse
off
would
he
not
have
been
had
it
all
been
true
it
was
night
and
when
he
reached
the
the
guests
were
there
already
chattering
of
the
coming
storm
antonia
was
not
yet
down
and
shelton
stood
by
the
piano
waiting
for
her
entry
red
faces
spotless
white
arms
and
hair
were
all
around
him
some
one
handed
him
a
clove
carnation
and
as
he
held
it
to
his
nose
antonia
came
in
breathless
as
though
she
had
rushed
her
cheeks
were
pale
no
longer
her
hand
kept
stealing
to
her
throat
the
flames
of
the
coming
storm
seemed
to
have
caught
fire
within
her
to
be
scorching
her
in
her
white
frock
she
passed
him
close
and
her
fragrance
whipped
his
senses
she
had
never
seemed
to
him
so
lovely
never
again
will
shelton
breathe
the
perfume
of
melons
and
pineapples
without
a
strange
emotion
from
where
he
sat
at
dinner
he
could
not
see
antonia
but
amidst
the
chattering
of
voices
the
clink
of
glass
and
silver
the
sights
and
sounds
and
scents
of
feasting
he
thought
how
he
would
go
to
her
and
say
that
nothing
mattered
but
her
love
he
drank
the
frosted
liquid
of
champagne
as
if
it
had
been
water
the
windows
stood
wide
open
in
the
heat
the
garden
lay
in
thick
soft
shadow
where
the
pitchy
shapes
of
trees
could
be
discerned
there
was
not
a
breath
of
air
to
fan
the
above
the
flowers
but
two
large
moths
fearful
of
the
heavy
dark
flew
in
and
wheeled
between
the
lights
over
the
diners
heads
one
fell
scorched
into
a
dish
of
fruit
and
was
removed
the
other
eluding
all
the
swish
of
napkins
and
the
efforts
of
the
footmen
continued
to
make
soft
fluttering
rushes
till
shelton
rose
and
caught
it
in
his
hand
he
took
it
to
the
window
and
threw
it
out
into
the
darkness
and
he
noticed
that
the
air
was
thick
and
tepid
to
his
face
at
a
sign
from
dennant
the
muslin
curtains
were
then
drawn
across
the
windows
and
in
gratitude
perhaps
for
this
protection
this
filmy
barrier
between
them
and
the
muffled
threats
of
nature
everyone
broke
out
in
talk
it
was
such
a
night
as
comes
in
summer
after
perfect
weather
frightening
in
its
heat
and
silence
which
was
broken
by
the
distant
thunder
travelling
low
along
the
ground
like
the
muttering
of
all
dark
places
on
the
earth
such
a
night
as
seems
by
very
breathlessness
to
smother
life
and
with
its
fateful
threats
to
justify
man
cowardice
the
ladies
rose
at
last
the
circle
of
the
rosewood
which
had
no
cloth
strewn
with
flowers
and
silver
gilt
had
a
likeness
to
some
autumn
pool
whose
brown
depths
of
oily
water
gleam
under
the
sunset
with
red
and
yellow
leaves
above
it
the
smoke
of
cigarettes
was
clinging
like
a
mist
to
water
when
the
sun
goes
down
shelton
became
involved
in
argument
with
his
neighbour
on
the
english
character
in
england
we
mislaid
the
recipe
of
life
he
said
pleasure
a
lost
art
we
do
get
drunk
we
ashamed
of
love
and
as
to
beauty
we
lost
the
eye
for
it
in
exchange
we
have
got
money
but
what
the
good
of
money
when
we
do
know
how
to
spend
it
excited
by
his
neighbour
smile
he
added
as
to
thought
we
think
so
much
of
what
our
neighbours
think
that
we
never
think
at
all
have
you
ever
watched
a
foreigner
when
he
listening
to
an
englishman
we
in
the
habit
of
despising
foreigners
the
scorn
we
have
for
them
is
nothing
to
the
scorn
they
have
for
us
and
they
are
right
look
at
our
taste
what
is
the
good
of
owning
riches
if
we
do
know
how
to
use
them
that
rather
new
to
me
his
neighbour
said
there
may
be
something
in
it
did
you
see
that
case
in
the
papers
the
other
day
of
old
hornblower
who
left
the
port
that
fetched
a
guinea
a
bottle
when
the
purchaser
poor
feller
came
to
drink
it
he
found
eleven
bottles
out
of
twelve
completely
ullaged
ha
ha
well
there
nothing
wrong
with
this
and
he
drained
his
glass
no
answered
shelton
when
they
rose
to
join
the
ladies
he
slipped
out
on
the
lawn
at
once
he
was
enveloped
in
a
bath
of
heat
a
heavy
odour
sensual
sinister
was
in
the
air
as
from
a
sudden
flowering
of
amorous
shrubs
he
stood
and
drank
it
in
with
greedy
nostrils
putting
his
hand
down
he
felt
the
grass
it
was
dry
and
charged
with
electricity
then
he
saw
pale
and
candescent
in
the
blackness
three
or
four
great
lilies
the
authors
of
that
perfume
the
blossoms
seemed
to
be
rising
at
him
through
the
darkness
as
though
putting
up
their
faces
to
be
kissed
he
straightened
himself
abruptly
and
went
in
the
guests
were
leaving
when
shelton
who
was
watching
saw
antonia
slip
through
the
window
he
could
follow
the
white
glimmer
of
her
frock
across
the
lawn
but
lost
it
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
casting
a
hasty
look
to
see
that
he
was
not
observed
he
too
slipped
out
the
blackness
and
the
heat
were
stifling
he
took
great
breaths
of
it
as
if
it
were
the
purest
mountain
air
and
treading
softly
on
the
grass
stole
on
towards
the
holm
oak
his
lips
were
dry
his
heart
beat
painfully
the
mutter
of
the
distant
thunder
had
quite
ceased
waves
of
hot
air
came
wheeling
in
his
face
and
in
their
midst
a
sudden
rush
of
cold
he
thought
the
storm
is
coming
now
and
stole
on
towards
the
tree
she
was
lying
in
the
hammock
her
figure
a
white
blur
in
the
heart
of
the
tree
shadow
rocking
gently
to
a
little
creaking
of
the
branch
shelton
held
his
breath
she
had
not
heard
him
he
crept
up
close
behind
the
trunk
till
he
stood
in
touch
of
her
i
must
startle
her
he
thought
antonia
there
was
a
faint
stir
in
the
hammock
but
no
answer
he
stood
over
her
but
even
then
he
could
not
see
her
face
he
only
had
a
sense
of
something
breathing
and
alive
within
a
yard
of
him
of
something
warm
and
soft
he
whispered
again
antonia
but
again
there
came
no
answer
and
a
sort
of
fear
and
frenzy
seized
on
him
he
could
no
longer
hear
her
breathe
the
creaking
of
the
branch
had
ceased
what
was
passing
in
that
silent
living
creature
there
so
close
and
then
he
heard
again
the
sound
of
breathing
quick
and
scared
like
the
fluttering
of
a
bird
in
a
moment
he
was
staring
in
the
dark
at
an
empty
hammock
he
stayed
beside
the
empty
hammock
till
he
could
bear
uncertainty
no
longer
but
as
he
crossed
the
lawn
the
sky
was
rent
from
end
to
end
by
jagged
lightning
rain
spattered
him
from
head
to
foot
and
with
a
deafening
crack
the
thunder
broke
he
sought
the
but
recoiling
at
the
door
went
to
his
own
room
and
threw
himself
down
on
the
bed
the
thunder
groaned
and
sputtered
in
long
volleys
the
lightning
showed
him
the
shapes
of
things
within
the
room
with
a
weird
distinctness
that
rent
from
them
all
likeness
to
the
purpose
they
were
made
for
bereaved
them
of
utility
of
their
presented
them
as
skeletons
abstractions
with
indecency
in
their
appearance
like
the
naked
nerves
and
sinews
of
a
leg
preserved
in
spirit
the
sound
of
the
rain
against
the
house
stunned
his
power
of
thinking
he
rose
to
shut
his
windows
then
returning
to
his
bed
threw
himself
down
again
he
stayed
there
till
the
storm
was
over
in
a
kind
of
stupor
but
when
the
boom
of
the
retreating
thunder
grew
every
minute
less
distinct
he
rose
then
for
the
first
time
he
saw
something
white
close
by
the
door
it
was
a
note
i
have
made
a
mistake
please
forgive
me
and
go
antonia
chapter
xxxii
wilderness
when
he
had
read
this
note
shelton
put
it
down
beside
his
on
his
dressing
table
stared
in
the
mirror
at
himself
and
laughed
but
his
lips
soon
stopped
him
laughing
he
threw
himself
upon
his
bed
and
pressed
his
face
into
the
pillows
he
lay
there
throughout
the
night
and
when
he
rose
soon
after
dawn
he
had
not
made
his
mind
up
what
to
do
the
only
thing
he
knew
for
certain
was
that
he
must
not
meet
antonia
at
last
he
penned
the
following
i
have
had
a
sleepless
night
with
toothache
and
think
it
best
to
run
up
to
the
dentist
at
once
if
a
tooth
must
come
out
the
sooner
the
better
he
addressed
it
to
dennant
and
left
it
on
his
table
after
doing
this
he
threw
himself
once
more
upon
his
bed
and
this
time
fell
into
a
doze
he
woke
with
a
start
dressed
and
let
himself
quietly
out
the
likeness
of
his
going
to
that
of
ferrand
struck
him
both
outcasts
now
he
thought
he
tramped
on
till
noon
without
knowing
or
caring
where
he
went
then
entering
a
field
threw
himself
down
under
the
hedge
and
fell
asleep
he
was
awakened
by
a
whirr
a
covey
of
partridges
with
wings
glistening
in
the
sun
were
straggling
out
across
the
adjoining
field
of
mustard
they
soon
settled
in
the
way
of
partridges
and
began
to
call
upon
each
other
some
cattle
had
approached
him
in
his
sleep
and
a
beautiful
bay
cow
with
her
head
turned
sideways
was
snuffing
at
him
gently
exhaling
her
peculiar
sweetness
she
was
as
fine
in
legs
and
coat
as
any
she
dribbled
at
the
corners
of
her
black
moist
lips
her
eye
was
soft
and
cynical
breathing
the
vague
sweetness
of
the
rubbing
dry
in
his
fingers
shelton
had
a
moment
happiness
the
happiness
of
sun
and
sky
of
the
eternal
quiet
and
untold
movements
of
the
fields
why
could
not
human
beings
let
their
troubles
be
as
this
cow
left
the
flies
that
clung
about
her
eyes
he
dozed
again
and
woke
up
with
a
laugh
for
this
was
what
he
dreamed
he
fancied
he
was
in
a
room
at
once
the
hall
and
of
some
country
house
in
the
centre
of
this
room
a
lady
stood
who
was
looking
in
a
at
her
face
beyond
a
door
or
window
could
be
seen
a
garden
with
a
row
of
statues
and
through
this
door
people
passed
without
apparent
object
suddenly
shelton
saw
his
mother
advancing
to
the
lady
with
the
whom
now
he
recognised
as
foliot
but
as
he
looked
his
mother
changed
to
dennant
and
began
speaking
in
a
voice
that
was
a
sort
of
abstract
of
refinement
je
fais
de
la
philosophic
it
said
i
take
the
individual
for
what
she
worth
i
do
not
condemn
above
all
one
must
have
spirit
the
lady
with
the
mirror
continued
looking
in
the
glass
and
though
he
could
not
see
her
face
he
could
see
its
with
greenish
eyes
and
a
smile
like
scorn
itself
then
by
a
swift
transition
he
was
walking
in
the
garden
talking
to
dennant
it
was
from
this
talk
that
he
awoke
with
laughter
but
she
had
been
saying
dick
i
always
been
accustomed
to
believe
what
i
was
told
it
was
so
unkind
of
her
to
scorn
me
just
because
i
happen
to
be
and
her
voice
awakened
shelton
pity
it
was
like
a
frightened
child
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
if
i
have
to
form
opinions
for
myself
i
was
brought
up
to
it
i
always
had
them
nice
and
secondhand
how
am
i
to
go
to
work
one
must
believe
what
other
people
do
not
that
i
think
much
of
other
people
but
you
do
know
what
it
is
one
feels
so
much
more
comfortable
and
her
skirts
rustled
but
dick
whatever
happens
her
voice
entreated
do
let
antonia
get
her
judgments
secondhand
never
mind
for
me
if
i
must
form
opinions
for
myself
i
must
but
do
let
her
any
old
opinions
so
long
as
they
are
old
it
dreadful
to
have
to
think
out
new
ones
for
and
he
awoke
his
dream
had
had
in
it
the
element
called
art
for
in
its
gross
absurdity
dennant
had
said
things
that
showed
her
soul
more
fully
than
anything
she
would
have
said
in
life
no
said
a
voice
quite
close
behind
the
hedge
not
many
frenchmen
thank
the
lord
a
few
coveys
of
hungarians
over
from
the
duke
sir
james
some
pie
shelton
raised
himself
with
drowsy
curiosity
still
half
asleep
and
applied
his
face
to
a
gap
in
the
high
thick
osiers
of
the
hedge
four
men
were
seated
on
round
a
on
which
was
a
pie
and
other
things
to
eat
a
with
birds
and
hares
stood
at
a
short
distance
the
tails
of
some
dogs
were
seen
moving
humbly
and
a
valet
opening
bottles
shelton
had
forgotten
that
it
was
the
the
host
was
a
soldierly
and
freckled
man
an
older
man
sat
next
him
with
an
eye
and
sharpened
nose
next
him
again
there
was
a
bearded
person
whom
they
seemed
to
call
the
commodore
in
the
fourth
to
his
alarm
shelton
recognised
the
gentleman
called
mabbey
it
was
really
no
matter
for
surprise
to
meet
him
miles
from
his
own
place
for
he
was
one
of
those
who
wander
with
a
valet
and
two
guns
from
the
twelfth
of
august
to
the
end
of
january
and
are
then
supposed
to
go
to
monte
carlo
or
to
sleep
until
the
twelfth
of
august
comes
again
he
was
speaking
did
you
hear
what
a
bag
we
made
on
the
twelfth
sir
james
ah
yes
what
was
that
have
you
sold
your
bay
horse
glennie
shelton
had
not
decided
whether
or
no

always
the
dark

a
sound
as

licked
his
lips

the
voice
of
the
host
he
never
gives
you
back
a
greeting
now
queer
fish
they
say
that
she
devoted
to
coming
so
closely
on
his
meeting
with
this
lady
and
on
the
dream
from
which
he
had
awakened
this
conversation
mesmerised
the
listener
behind

shootin

queer
fellows

the
commodore

his
horses

chestnut
of

said
the
voice
of
mabbey
take
to
drink
or
writin
books
old
charlie
wayne
came
to
gazin
at
stars
and
twice
a
week
he
used
to

and
paddle
round
in
whitechapel
pothooks
glennie
said
sir
james
what

of

your
old
keeper
obliged
to

again
to
close
his
ears
but
again

listened

a
bit
too
old

lot
of
eggs

the
commodore
when

of
fact

a
girl
into
trouble
when
her
people

her
the
chuck
old
smollet
took
her
in
beastly
scandal
it
made
too
the
girl
refused
to
marry
smollett
and
old
smollett
backed
her
up
naturally
the
parson
and
the
village
cut
up
rough
my
wife
offered
to
get
her
into
one
of
those
reformatory
but
the
old
fellow
said
she
should
go
if
she
did
want
to
bad
business
altogether
put
him
quite
off
his
stroke
i
only
got
five
hundred
pheasants
last
year
instead
of
there
was
a
silence
shelton
again
peeped
through
the
hedge
all
were
eating
pie
in
warwickshire
said
the
commodore
they
always
marry
haw
and
live
reshpectable
ever
quite
so
remarked
the
host
it
was
a
bit
too
thick
her
refusing
to
marry
him
she
said
he
took
advantage
of
she
sorry
by
this
time
said
sir
james
lucky
escape
for
young
smollett
queer
the
obstinacy
of
some
of
these
old
fellows
what
are
we
doing
after
lunch
asked
the
commodore
the
next
field
said
the
host
is
pasture
we
line
up
along
the
hedge
and
drive
that
mustard
towards
the
roots
there
ought
to
be
a
good
few
shelton
rose
and
crouching
stole
softly
to
the
gate
on
the
twelfth
shootin
in
two
parties
followed
the
voice
of
mabbey
from
the
distance
whether
from
his
walk
or
from
his
sleepless
night
shelton
seemed
to
ache
in
every
limb
but
he
continued
his
tramp
along
the
road
he
was
no
nearer
to
deciding
what
to
do
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
when
he
reached
maidenhead
and
after
breaking
fast
got
into
a
london
train
and
went
to
sleep
at
ten
that
evening
he
walked
into
james
park
and
there
sat
down
the
lamplight
dappled
through
the
tired
foliage
on
to
these
benches
which
have
rested
many
vagrants
darkness
has
ceased
to
be
the
lawful
cloak
of
the
unhappy
but
mother
night
was
soft
and
moonless
and
man
had
not
despoiled
her
of
her
comfort
quite
shelton
was
not
alone
upon
the
seat
for
at
the
far
end
was
sitting
a
young
girl
with
a
red
round
sullen
face
and
beyond
and
further
still
were
dim
benches
and
dim
figures
sitting
on
them
as
though
life
institutions
had
shot
them
out
in
an
endless
line
of
rubbish
ah
thought
shelton
in
the
dreamy
way
of
tired
people
the
institutions
are
all
right
it
the
spirit
that
all
wrong
said
a
voice
behind
him
why
of
course
you
taken
the
wrong
turn
old
he
saw
a
policeman
with
a
red
face
shining
through
the
darkness
talking
to
a
strange
old
figure
like
some
aged
and
dishevelled
bird
thank
you
constable
the
old
man
said
as
i
come
wrong
i
take
a
chewing
his
gums
he
seemed
to
fear
to
take
the
liberty
of
sitting
down
shelton
made
room
and
the
old
fellow
took
the
vacant
place
you
excuse
me
sir
i
sure
he
said
in
shaky
tones
and
snatching
at
his
battered
hat
i
see
you
was
a
gentleman
and
lovingly
he
dwelt
upon
the
word
would
disturb
you
for
the
world
i
not
used
to
being
out
at
night
and
the
seats
do
get
so
full
old
age
must
lean
on
something
you
excuse
me
sir
i
of
course
said
shelton
gently
i
a
respectable
old
man
really
said
his
neighbour
i
never
took
a
liberty
in
my
life
but
at
my
age
sir
you
get
nervous
about
the
streets
as
i
been
this
last
week
an
sleepin
in
them
oh
they
dreadful
rough
places
a
dreadful
rough
lot
there
yes
the
old
man
said
again
as
shelton
turned
to
look
at
him
struck
by
the
real
in
his
voice
dreadful
rough
places
a
movement
of
his
head
which
grew
on
a
lean
plucked
neck
like
that
of
an
old
fowl
had
brought
his
face
into
the
light
it
was
long
and
run
to
seed
and
had
a
large
red
nose
its
thin
colourless
lips
were
twisted
sideways
and
apart
showing
his
mouth
and
his
eyes
had
that
aged
look
of
eyes
in
which
all
colour
runs
into
a
thin
rim
round
the
iris
and
over
them
kept
coming
films
like
the
films
over
parrots
eyes
he
was
or
should
have
been
his
hair
for
he
had
taken
off
his
hat
was
thick
and
lank
of
dusty
colour
as
far
as
could
be
seen
without
a
speck
of
grey
and
parted
very
beautifully
just
about
the
middle
i
can
put
up
with
that
he
said
again
i
never
interferes
with
nobody
and
nobody
do
interfere
with
me
but
what
frightens
me
his
voice
grew
steady
as
if
too
terrified
to
shake
is
never
knowin
day
to
day
what
to
become
of
yer
oh
that
dreadful
that
is
it
must
be
answered
shelton
ah
it
is
the
old
man
said
and
the
winter
cumin
on
i
never
was
much
used
to
open
air
bein
in
domestic
service
all
my
life
but
i
do
mind
that
so
long
as
i
can
see
my
way
to
earn
a
livin
well
thank
god
i
got
a
job
at
last
and
his
voice
grew
cheerful
suddenly
sellin
papers
is
not
what
i
been
accustomed
to
but
the
westminister
they
tell
me
that
one
of
the
most
respectable
of
the
evenin
papers
in
fact
i
know
it
is
so
now
i
sure
to
get
on
i
try
how
did
you
get
the
job
asked
shelton
i
got
my
character
the
old
fellow
said
making
a
gesture
with
a
skinny
hand
towards
his
chest
as
if
it
were
there
he
kept
his
character
thank
god
nobody
ca
take
that
away
i
never
parts
from
that
and
fumbling
he
produced
a
packet
holding
first
one
paper
to
the
light
and
then
another
and
he
looked
anxiously
at
shelton
in
that
house
where
i
been
sleepin
they
not
honest
they
stolen
a
parcel
of
my
things
a
lovely
shirt
an
a
pair
of
beautiful
gloves
a
gentleman
gave
me
for
holdin
of
his
horse
now
would
you
prosecute
sir
it
depends
on
what
you
can
i
know
they
had
a
man
must
stand
up
for
his
rights
that
only
proper
i
ca
afford
to
lose
beautiful
things
like
them
i
think
i
ought
to
prosecute
now
do
you
sir
shelton
restrained
a
smile
there
said
the
old
man
smoothing
out
a
piece
of
paper
shakily
that
sir
george
and
his
withered
trembled
on
the
middle
of
the
page
creed
in
my
service
five
years
as
butler
during
which
time
i
have
found
him
all
that
a
servant
should
be
and
this
he
fumbled
with
another
this
lady
glengow
creed
i
thought
i
like
you
to
read
since
you
been
so
will
you
have
a
pipe
thank
ye
sir
replied
the
aged
butler
filling
his
clay
from
shelton
pouch
then
taking
a
front
tooth
between
his
finger
and
his
thumb
he
began
to
feel
it
tenderly
working
it
to
and
fro
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
pride
my
teeth
out
he
said
but
i
enjoys
pretty
good
health
for
a
man
of
my
how
old
is
that
barrin
my
cough
and
my
rupture
and
this
affliction
he
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
i
nothing
to
complain
of
everybody
has
somethink
it
seems
i
a
wonder
for
my
age
i
shelton
for
all
his
pity
would
have
given
much
to
laugh
he
said
yes
a
great
age
you
remember
the
country
when
it
was
very
different
to
what
it
is
now
ah
said
the
old
butler
there
was
gentry
then
i
remember
them
drivin
down
to
newmarket
my
native
place
sir
with
their
own
horses
there
was
so
much
o
these
here
middle
classes
then
there
was
more
too
what
you
might
call
the
milk
o
human
kindness
in
people
then
none
o
them
amalgamated
stores
every
man
keepin
his
own
little
shop
not
so
eager
to
cut
his
neighbour
throat
as
you
might
say
and
then
look
at
the
price
of
bread
o
dear
why
it
is
a
quarter
what
it
was
and
are
people
happier
now
than
they
were
then
asked
shelton
the
old
butler
sucked
his
pipe
no
he
answered
shaking
his
old
head
they
lost
the
contented
spirit
i
see
people
runnin
here
and
runnin
there
readin
books
findin
things
out
they
ai
not
so
as
they
is
that
possible
thought
shelton
no
repeated
the
old
man
again
sucking
at
his
pipe
and
this
time
blowing
out
a
lot
of
smoke
i
do
see
as
much
happiness
about
not
the
same
look
on
the
faces
is
likely
see
these
motorcars
too
they
say
is
goin
out
and
as
if
dumbfounded
at
his
own
conclusion
he
sat
silent
for
some
time
engaged
in
the
lighting
and
relighting
of
his
pipe
the
girl
at
the
far
end
stirred
cleared
her
throat
and
settled
down
again
her
movement
disengaged
a
scent
of
frowsy
clothes
the
policeman
had
approached
and
scrutinised
these
faces
his
glance
was
jovially
contemptuous
till
he
noticed
shelton
and
then
was
modified
by
curiosity
there
good
men
in
the
police
the
aged
butler
said
when
the
policeman
had
passed
on
there
good
men
in
the
police
as
good
men
as
you
can
see
and
there
them
that
treats
you
like
the
dirt
a
dreadful
low
class
of
man
oh
dear
yes
when
they
see
you
down
in
the
world
they
think
they
can
speak
to
you
as
they
like
i
do
give
them
no
chance
to
worry
me
i
keeps
myself
to
myself
and
speak
civil
to
all
the
world
you
have
to
hold
the
candle
to
them
for
oh
dear
if
they
crossed
some
of
them
they
a
dreadful
lot
of
men
are
you
going
to
spend
the
night
here
it
nice
and
warm
replied
the
aged
butler
i
said
to
the
man
at
that
low
place
i
said
you
ever
speak
to
me
again
i
said
you
come
near
me
straightforward
and
honest
been
my
motto
all
my
life
i
do
want
to
have
nothing
to
say
to
them
low
fellows
he
made
an
annihilating
gesture
after
the
way
they
treated
me
takin
my
things
like
that
tomorrow
i
shall
get
a
room
for
three
shillin
a
week
do
you
think
so
sir
well
then
i
shall
be
all
right
i
not
afraid
now
the
mind
at
rest
so
long
as
i
ran
keep
myself
that
all
i
want
i
shall
do
i
think
and
he
stared
at
shelton
but
the
look
in
his
eyes
and
the
optimism
of
his
voice
convinced
the
latter
that
he
lived
in
dread
so
long
as
i
can
keep
myself
he
said
again
i
need
no
workhouse
nor
lose
no
thought
shelton
and
for
some
time
sat
without
a
word
when
you
can
he
said
at
last
come
and
see
me
here
my
the
aged
butler
became
conscious
with
a
jerk
for
he
was
nodding
thank
ye
sir
i
will
he
said
with
pitiful
alacrity
down
by
belgravia
oh
i
know
it
well
i
lived
down
in
them
parts
with
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
bateson
perhaps
you
knew
him
he
dead
now
the
honourable
bateson
thank
ye
sir
i
be
sure
to
come
and
snatching
at
his
battered
hat
he
toilsomely
secreted
shelton
card
amongst
his
character
a
minute
later
he
began
again
to
nod
the
policeman
passed
a
second
time
his
gaze
seemed
to
say
now
a
toff
doing
on
that
seat
with
those
two
rotters
and
shelton
caught
his
eye
ah
he
thought
exactly
you
do
know
what
to
make
of
me
a
man
of
my
position
sitting
here
poor
devil
to
spend
your
days
in
spying
on
your
poor
devil
but
you
do
know
that
you
a
poor
devil
and
so
you
not
the
man
on
the
next
bench
sneezed
a
shrill
and
disapproving
sneeze
the
policeman
passed
again
and
seeing
that
the
lower
creatures
were
both
dozing
he
spoke
to
shelton
not
very
safe
on
these
benches
sir
he
said
you
never
know
who
you
may
be
sittin
next
to
if
i
were
you
sir
i
should
be
on
if
you
not
goin
to
spend
the
night
here
that
is
and
he
laughed
as
at
an
admirable
joke
shelton
looked
at
him
and
itched
to
say
why
should
i
but
it
struck
him
that
it
would
sound
very
odd
besides
he
thought
i
shall
only
catch
a
cold
and
without
speaking
he
left
the
seat
and
went
along
towards
his
rooms
chapter
xxxiii
the
end
he
reached
his
rooms
at
midnight
so
exhausted
that
without
waiting
to
light
up
he
dropped
into
a
chair
the
curtains
and
blinds
had
been
removed
for
cleaning
and
the
tall
windows
admitted
the
night
staring
gaze
shelton
fixed
his
eyes
on
that
outside
darkness
as
one
lost
man
might
fix
his
eyes
upon
another
an
unaired
dusty
odour
clung
about
the
room
but
like
some
whiff
of
grass
or
flowers
wafted
to
one
sometimes
in
the
streets
a
perfume
came
to
him
the
spice
from
the
withered
clove
carnation
still
clinging
to
his
and
he
suddenly
awoke
from
his
queer
trance
there
was
a
decision
to
be
made
he
rose
to
light
a
candle
the
dust
was
thick
on
everything
he
touched
ugh
he
thought
how
wretched
and
the
loneliness
that
had
seized
him
on
the
stone
seat
at
holm
oaks
the
day
before
returned
with
fearful
force
on
his
table
heaped
without
order
were
a
pile
of
bills
and
circulars
he
opened
them
tearing
at
their
covers
with
the
random
haste
of
men
back
from
their
holidays
a
single
long
envelope
was
placed
apart
my
dear
dick
he
read
i
enclose
you
herewith
the
revised
draft
of
your
marriage
settlement
it
is
now
shipshape
return
it
before
the
end
of
the
week
and
i
will
have
it
engrossed
for
signature
i
go
to
scotland
next
wednesday
for
a
month
shall
be
back
in
good
time
for
your
wedding
my
love
to
your
mother
when
you
see
her
uncle
edmund
paramor
shelton
smiled
and
took
out
the
draft
this
indenture
made
the
day
of
between
richard
paramor
shelton
he
put
it
down
and
sank
back
in
his
chair
the
chair
in
which
the
foreign
vagrant
had
been
wont
to
sit
on
mornings
when
he
came
to
preach
philosophy
he
did
not
stay
there
long
but
in
sheer
unhappiness
got
up
and
taking
his
candle
roamed
about
the
room
fingering
things
and
gazing
in
the
mirror
at
his
face
which
seemed
to
him
repulsive
in
its
wretchedness
he
went
at
last
into
the
hall
and
opened
the
door
to
go
downstairs
again
into
the
street
but
the
sudden
certainty
that
in
street
or
house
in
town
or
country
he
would
have
to
take
his
trouble
with
him
made
him
shut
it
to
he
felt
in
the
letterbox
drew
forth
a
letter
and
with
this
he
went
back
to
the
it
was
from
antonia
and
such
was
his
excitement
that
he
was
forced
to
take
three
turns
between
the
window
and
the
wall
before
he
could
read
then
with
a
heart
beating
so
that
he
could
hardly
hold
the
paper
he
began
i
was
wrong
to
ask
you
to
go
away
i
see
now
that
it
was
breaking
my
promise
and
i
did
mean
to
do
that
i
do
know
why
things
have
come
to
be
so
different
you
never
think
as
i
do
about
anything
i
had
better
tell
you
that
that
letter
of
monsieur
ferrand
to
mother
was
impudent
of
course
you
did
know
what
was
in
it
but
when
professor
brayne
was
asking
you
about
him
at
breakfast
i
felt
that
you
believed
that
he
was
right
and
we
were
wrong
and
i
ca
understand
it
and
then
in
the
afternoon
when
that
woman
hurt
her
horse
it
was
all
as
if
you
were
on
her
side
how
can
you
feel
like
that
i
must
say
this
because
i
do
think
i
ought
to
have
asked
you
to
go
away
and
i
want
you
to
believe
that
i
will
keep
my
promise
or
i
should
feel
that
you
and
everybody
else
had
a
right
to
condemn
me
i
was
awake
all
last
night
and
have
a
bad
headache
this
morning
i
ca
write
any
more
antonia
his
first
sensation
was
a
sort
of
stupefaction
of
relief
that
had
in
it
an
element
of
anger
he
was
reprieved
she
would
not
break
her
promise
she
considered
herself
bound
in
the
midst
of
the
exaltation
of
this
thought
he
smiled
and
that
smile
was
strange
he
read
it
through
again
and
like
a
judge
began
to
weigh
what
she
had
written
her
thoughts
when
she
was
writing
the
facts
which
had
led
up
to
this
the
vagrant
farewell
document
had
done
the
business
true
to
his
fatal
gift
of
divesting
things
of
clothing
ferrand
had
not
vanished
without
showing
up
his
patron
in
his
proper
colours
even
to
shelton
those
colours
were
made
plain
antonia
had
felt
her
lover
was
a
traitor
sounding
his
heart
even
in
his
stress
of
indecision
shelton
knew
that
this
was
true
then
in
the
afternoon
when
that
woman
hurt
her
that
woman
it
was
as
if
you
were
on
her
side
he
saw
too
well
her
mind
its
clear
rigidity
its
intuitive
perception
of
that
with
which
it
was
not
safe
to
sympathise
its
instinct
for
its
spontaneous
contempt
for
those
without
that
instinct
and
she
had
written
these
words
considering
herself
bound
to
him
a
man
of
sentiment
of
rebellious
sympathies
of
untidiness
of
principle
here
was
the
answer
to
the
question
he
had
asked
all
day
how
have
things
come
to
such
a
pass
and
he
began
to
feel
compassion
for
her
poor
child
she
could
not
jilt
him
there
was
something
vulgar
in
the
word
never
should
it
be
said
that
antonia
dennant
had
accented
him
and
thrown
him
over
no
lady
did
these
things
they
were
impossible
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
he
had
a
queer
unconscious
sympathy
with
this
impossibility
once
again
he
read
the
letter
which
seemed
now
impregnated
with
fresh
meaning
and
the
anger
which
had
mingled
with
his
first
sensation
of
relief
detached
itself
and
grew
in
force
in
that
letter
there
was
something
tyrannous
a
denial
of
his
right
to
have
a
separate
point
of
view
it
was
like
a
finger
pointed
at
him
as
an
unsound
person
in
marrying
her
he
would
be
marrying
not
only
her
but
her
class
his
class
she
would
be
there
always
to
make
him
look
on
her
and
on
himself
and
all
the
people
that
they
knew
and
all
the
things
they
did
complacently
she
would
be
there
to
make
him
feel
himself
superior
to
everyone
whose
life
was
cast
in
other
moral
moulds
to
feel
himself
superior
not
blatantly
not
consciously
but
with
subconscious
righteousness
but
his
anger
which
was
like
the
paroxysm
that
two
days
before
had
made
him
mutter
at
the
connoisseur
i
hate
your
d
superiority
struck
him
all
at
once
as
impotent
and
ludicrous
what
was
the
good
of
being
angry
he
was
on
the
point
of
losing
her
and
the
anguish
of
that
thought
reacting
on
his
anger
intensified
it
threefold
she
was
so
certain
of
herself
so
superior
to
her
emotions
to
her
natural
impulses
superior
to
her
very
longing
to
be
free
from
him
of
that
fact
at
all
events
shelton
had
no
longer
any
doubt
it
was
beyond
argument
she
did
not
really
love
him
she
wanted
to
be
free
of
him
a
photograph
hung
in
his
bedroom
at
holm
oaks
of
a
group
round
the
hall
door
the
honourable
charlotte
penguin
dennant
lady
bonington
halidome
dennant
and
the
man
all
were
there
and
on
the
side
looking
straight
in
front
of
her
antonia
her
face
in
its
youthfulness
more
than
all
those
others
expressed
their
point
of
view
behind
those
calm
young
eyes
lay
a
world
of
safety
and
tradition
i
am
not
as
others
are
they
seemed
to
say
and
from
that
photograph
and
dennant
singled
themselves
out
he
could
see
their
faces
as
they
talked
their
faces
with
a
peculiar
and
uneasy
look
on
them
and
he
could
hear
their
voices
still
decisive
but
a
little
acid
as
if
they
had
been
quarrelling
he
made
a
donkey
of
himself
ah
it
too
they
too
thought
him
unsound
and
did
want
him
but
to
save
the
situation
they
would
be
glad
to
keep
him
she
did
want
him
but
she
refused
to
lose
her
right
to
say
commoner
girls
may
break
their
promises
i
will
not
he
sat
down
at
the
table
between
the
candles
covering
his
face
his
grief
and
anger
grew
and
grew
within
him
if
she
would
not
free
herself
the
duty
was
on
him
she
was
ready
without
love
to
marry
him
as
a
sacrifice
to
her
ideal
of
what
she
ought
to
be
but
she
had
after
all
the
monopoly
of
pride
as
if
she
stood
before
him
he
could
see
the
shadows
underneath
her
eyes
that
he
had
dreamed
of
kissing
the
eager
movements
of
her
lips
for
several
minutes
he
remained
not
moving
hand
or
limb
then
once
more
his
anger
blazed
she
was
going
to
sacrifice
herself
and
him
all
his
manhood
scoffed
at
such
a
senseless
sacrifice
that
was
not
exactly
what
he
wanted
he
went
to
the
bureau
took
a
piece
of
paper
and
an
envelope
and
wrote
as
follows
there
never
was
is
not
and
never
would
have
been
any
question
of
being
bound
between
us
i
refuse
to
trade
on
any
such
thing
you
are
absolutely
free
our
engagement
is
at
an
end
by
mutual
consent
richard
shelton
he
sealed
it
and
sitting
with
his
hands
between
his
knees
he
let
his
forehead
droop
lower
and
lower
to
the
table
till
it
rested
on
his
marriage
settlement
and
he
had
a
feeling
of
relief
like
one
who
drops
exhausted
at
his
journey
end
