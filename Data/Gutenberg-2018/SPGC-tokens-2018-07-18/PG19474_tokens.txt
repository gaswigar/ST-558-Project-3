all

previously

science

is
now
available
in
ace

was
first
published
in
in
a
twayne
science

triplet
a
hardbound
collection
of
three
thematically
connected
novels
the
other
two
were
judith

pratt
long
a
year
later
it
appeared
in
the
february
and
march
issues
of
science
edited
by
lester
del
rey
the
magazine
version
which
was
abridged
by
about
a
third
was
believed
by
many
bibliographers
to
be
the
only
version
and
as
a
novella
it
was
too
short
for
book
publication
the
twayne
version
had
a
small
print
run
and
is
so
scarce
that
few
people
have
seen
it
those
bibliographers
who
knew
of
its
existence
assumed
that
both
versions
of
were
the
same
it
was
through
a
telephone
conversation
with
charles
brown
publisher
of
and
correspondent
with
piper
that
i
learned
about
the
twayne
edition
and
its
greater
length
brown
allowed
me
to
photocopy
his
original
for
which
we
owe
him
a
debt
of
thanks
because
the
twayne
version
is
not
only
novel
length
but
far
better
than
the
shorter
one
that
appeared
in
science
probably
the
most
surprising
and
interesting
thing
about
the
twayne
edition
is
the
essay
that
forms
the
introduction
to
that
volume
and
is
reprinted
here
the
essay
is
by
john
clark
an
eminent
scientist
of
the
fourties
and
fifties
and
one
of
the
discoverers
of
sulfa
the
first
miracle
drug
it
describes
in
great
detail
the
planetary
system
of
the
star
beta
hydri
and
gives
the
names
of
those
planets
uller
and
niflheim
a
publisher
note
states
that
essay
was
written
first
and
given
to
the
contributors
as
background
material
for
a
novel
they
would
then
write
the
fans
of
beam
piper
seem
to
owe
a
great
debt
to
clark
became
the
foundation
of
piper
monumental
future
history
the
first
story
where
we
encounter
the
terran
federation
in
it
we
learn
about
odin
the
planet
that
will
one
day
be
the
capital
of
the
first
galactic
empire
and
humble
niflheim
which
in
more
decadent
times
will
become
a
common
expletive
a
word
meaning
hell
this
is
also
where
piper
introduced
and
explained
the
atomic
era
dating
system
is
set
in
the
early
years
of
the
terran
federation
expansion
and
exploration
an
epoch
of
great
vitality
in
the
edge
of
the
knife
piper
compares
this
time
of
discovery
to
the
spanish
conquest
of
the
americas
this
feeling
of
vigor
and
unlimited
possibilities
runs
through
all
the
early
federation
stories
omnilingual
naudsonce
when
in
the
course
and
to
a
lesser
degree
in
the
late
federation
novels
and
and
other
see
by
beam
piper
for
a
good
overview
of
this
period
in
these
stories
we
see
at
their
best
and
at
their
worst
individual
heroism
and
bravery
in
the
face
of
grave
danger
in
federation
law
and
justice
in
and
its
sequels
and
in
omnilingual
and
naudsonce
the
spirit
of
science
and
rational
inquiry
yet
we
also
see
colonial
exploitation
and
subjugation
in
and
oomphel
in
the
sky
the
greed
and
corruption
of
chartered
land
companies
in
and
political
corruption
in
these
stories
are
about
a
living
culture
not
a
utopia
it
was
piper
attention
to
historical
realism
and
his
use
of
actual
historical
models
that
have
helped
his
work
to
pass
the
test
of
time
and
have
led
to
his
becoming
the
favorite
of
a
new
generation
of
readers
more
than
years
after
his
death
is
the
story
of
a
confrontation
between
a
human
overlord
and
alien
servants
with
an
ironic
twist
at
the
end
like
most
of
piper
best
work
is
modeled
after
an
actual
event
in
human
history
in
this
case
the
sepoy
mutiny
a
bengal
uprising
in
india
brought
about
when
rumors
were
spread
to
native
soldiers
that
cartridges
being
issued
by
the
british
were
coated
with
animal
fat
the
rebellion
quickly
spread
throughout
india
and
led
to
the
massacre
of
the
british
colony
at
novel
is
not
a
mere
retelling
of
the
indian
mutiny
but
rather
an
analysis
of
an
historical
event
applied
to
a
similar
situation
in
the
far
future
like
many
philosophers
and
social
theorists
before
him
piper
attempted
to
chart
the
progress
of
unlike
most
however
he
did
not
envision
or
try
to
create
a
system
of
ethics
that
would
end
all
of
humanity
problems
the
best
he
could
offer
was
his
model
of
the
man
the
man
who
actually
knows
what
has
to
be
done
and
how
to
do
it
and
he
going
to
go
right
ahead
and
do
it
without
holding
a
dozen
conferences
and
discussions
and
giving
everybody
a
fair
and
equal
chance
to
foul
things
up
for
him
piper
brought
his
own
ideas
and
judgments
about
society
and
history
into
all
of
his
work
but
they
appear
most
clearly
in
his
future
history
while
not
everyone
will
agree
with
piper
theories
they
give
his
work
a
bite
that
most
popular
fiction
lacks
one
can
not
read
piper
complacently
and
one
can
often
find
a
wry
insight
sandwiched
in
between
the
blood
and
thunder
other
future
histories
may
span
more
centuries
or
better
illuminate
the
highlights
of
several
decades
but
until
a
rival
is
created
with
more
historical
depth
and
attention
to
detail
beam
future
history
will
stand
as
the
bayeux
tapestry
of
science
fiction
histories
in
many
ways
certainly
during
his
lifetime
piper
was
the
most
underrated
of
the
john
campbell
astounding
writers
he
was
probably
also
the
most
campbellian
his
is
almost
a
mirror
image
of
campbell
citizen
piper
died
a
bitter
man
a
failure
in
his
own
mind
shortly
before
his
death
he
believed
he
could
no
longer
earn
a
living
as
a
writer
without
charity
from
his
friends
or
the
state
now
he
the
cornerstone
of
ace
books
had
he
lived
long
enough
to
finish
another
half
dozen
books
he
would
have
been
among
the
sf
greats
of
the
sixties
but
maybe
he
does
know
after
all
jerry
pournelle
who
was
very
much
influenced
by
piper
and
in
many
ways
considers
himself
spiritual
descendant
and
incidently
was
john

last
major
has
said
that
sometimes
when
he

the

it

that
when

the
names
of
greek

had
been
used
up

those
of

were
used

uller
revolves

a

the

of

the
axis
of

that
at
a

the

is
pointed

chemistry
and
geology
of
uller
calcium
and
chlorine
are
rarer
than
on
earth
sodium
is
somewhat
commoner
as
a
result
of
the
shortage
of
calcium
there
is
a
higher
ration
of
silicates
to
carbonates
than
exists
on
earth
the
water
is
slightly
alkaline
and
resembles
a
very
dilute
solution
of
sodium
silicate
water
glass
it
would
have
a
ph
of
and
tastes
slightly
soapy
also
when
it
dries
out
it
leaves
a
sticky
and
then
a
glassy
crackly
film
rocks
look
fairly
earthlike
but
the
absence
or
scarcity
of
anything
like
limestone
is
noticeable
practically
all
the
sedimentary
rocks
are
of
the
sandstone
type
all
rivers
are
seasonal
running
from
the
polar
regions
to
the
central
seas
in
the
spring
only
or
until
the
polar
cap
is
completely
dried
out
animal
life
as
on
earth
life
arose
in
the
primitive
waters
and
with
a
carbon
base
but
because
of
the
abundance
of
silicone
there
was
a
strong
tendency
for
the
microscopic
organisms
to
develop
silicate
exoskeletons
like
diatoms
the
present
invertebrate
animal
life
of
the
planet
is
of
this
type
and
is
confined
to
the
equatorial
seas
they
run
from
objects
to
things
like
crayfish
with
silicate
skeletons
later
some
species
of
them
started
taking
silicone
into
their
soft
tissues
and
eventually
their
compounds
were
converted
to
silicone
type
chains
from
c
c
c
to
o
si
o
si
o
si
with
organic
radicals
on
the
side
links
these
organisms
were
a
transitional
type
with
silicone
tissues
and
water
body
fluids
resembling
the
earthly
amphibians
and
are
now
practically
extinct
there
are
a
few
species
something
like
segmented
worms
still
to
be
seen
in
the
backwaters
of
the
central
seas
a
further
development
occurred
when
the
silicone
chain
animals
began
to
get
silicones
into
their
circulatory
systems
held
in
solution
by
oh
or
groups
on
the
ends
and
branches
of
the
chains
the
proportion
of
these
compounds
gradually
increased
until
the
water
was
a
minor
and
then
a
missing
constituent
the
larger
mobile
species
were
then
practically
anhydrous
their
blood
consists
of
silicones
with
quartz
reinforcing
for
the
soft
parts
and
their
armor
teeth
of
pure
amorphous
quartz
opal
most
of
these
parts
are
of
the
milky
variety
variously
tinted
with
metallic
impurities
as
are
the
varieties
of
sapphires
these
pure
silicone
animals
due
to
their
practical
indestructibility
annihilated
all
but
the
smaller
of
the
carbon
animals
and
drove
the
compromise
types
into
odd
corners
as
relics
they
developed
into
a
animal
with
a
very
large
to
compensate
for
the
rather
higher
density
of
the
silicone
tissues
and
from
these
fish
the
land
animals
developed
due
to
their
high
density
and
resulting
high
weight
they
tend
to
be
low
on
the
ground
rather
reptilian
in
look
three
pairs
of
legs
are
usual
in
order
to
distribute
the
heavy
load
there
is
no
sharp
dividing
line
between
the
quartz
armor
and
the
silicone
tissue
one
merges
into
the
other
the
dominant
pure
silicone
animals
only
could
become
mobile
and
venture
far
from
the
temperate
equatorial
regions
of
uller
since
they
neither
froze
nor
stiffened
with
cold
nor
became
incapacitated
by
heat
note
that
all
animal
life
is
with
a
negligible
difference
between
body
and
ambient
temperatures
since
the
animals
are
silicones
they
do
get
sluggish
like
cold
snakes
plant
life
the
plants
are
of
the
type
like
the
primitive
animals
they
spread
out
from
the
equator
as
far
as
they
could
go
before
the
baking
polar
summers
killed
them
they
have
normal
seasonal
growth
in
the
temperate
zones
and
remain
dormant
and
frozen
in
the
winter
at
the
poles
there
is
no
vegetation
not
because
of
the
cold
winter
but
because
of
the
hot
summer
the
winter
winds
frequently
blow
over
dead
trees
and
roll
them
as
far
as
the
equatorial
seas
other
dead
vegetation
because
of
the
highly
silicious
water
always
gets
petrified
unless
it
is
eaten
first
what
with
the
hides
of
the
living
vegetation
and
the
solid
quartz
of
the
dead
a
forest
is
spectacular
the
silicone
animals
live
on
the
plants
they
chew
them
up
dehydrate
them
and
convert
their
silicious
outer
bark
and
carbonaceous
interiors
into
silicones
for
themselves
when
silicone
tissue
is
metabolized
the
carbon
and
hydrogen
go
to
and
o
which
are
breathed
out
while
the
silicone
goes
into
which
is
deposited
as
more
teeth
and
armor
compare
the
terrestrial
octopus
which
makes
out
of
calcium
urate
instead
of
excreting
urea
or
uric
acid
the
animals
can
of
course
eat
each
other
too
or
make
a
meal
of
the
small
carbonaceous
animals
of
the
equatorial
seas
further
note
that
the
animals
can
not
digest
plants
when
they
are
cold
they
can
eat
them
and
store
them
but
the
disposal
of
the
solid
water
and
is
too
difficult
a
problem
when
they
warm
up
the
water
in
the
plants
melts
and
can
be
disposed
of
and
things
are
simpler

distant
from

which

niflheim
is
miles
from
its
primary
a
little
less
than
the
distance
of
jupiter
from
our
sun
it
thus
does
not
receive
too
great
a
total
amount
of
energy
but
what
it
does
receive
is
of
high
potential
a
large
fraction
of
it
being
in
the

higher
frequencies
watch
out
for
really
sunburn
on
unwarned
personnel
the
gravity
of
niflheim
is
approximately

and
the
average

the
oxidizer
in
the

is

fluorine
in
a
rather
low
concentration
about
or
percent
with
it
appears
a
mad
collection
of
gases
there
are
a
few
inert
diluents
such
as
nitrogen
argon

neon
but
the
major
fraction
consists
of
carbon
tetrafluoride

trifluoride

tetrafluoride
phosphorous
pentafluoride
sulphur
hexafluoride
and
probably
others
in
other
words
the

of
all
the
that
can
form
fluorides
the
phosphorous
pentafluoride
rains
out
when
the
weather
gets
cold
there
is
also
free
oxygen
but
no
chlorine
that
would
be
liquid
except
in

it

consists
exclusively
of
fluorides
of

metals
there
are
no
oxides
sulfides
silicates
or
chlorides
there
are
small
deposits
of
such
things
as
bromine
trifluoride
but
these
have
no
great
importance
since
fluorides
are
weak
mechanically
the
terrain
is
flattish
nothing
tough
like
granite
to
build
mountains
out
of
since
the
fluoride
ion
is
colorless
the
color
of
the
soil
depends
upon
the
predominant
metal
in
the
region
as
most
of
the
light

also
have
colorless

about

the

she
replied
helping
herself
at
the

navy
on

i
never
even
heard
of
nuclear

being
used
for
mining
till
i
came
here
though
well
if
this
turns
out
as
well
as
the
other
job
three
months
ago
it
be
something
to
see
he
promised
these
volcanoes
have
been
dormant
for
oh
maybe
as
long
as
a
thousand
years
there
ought
to
be
a
pretty
good
head
of

down
there
and
the
magma
be
thick
viscous

this

it

what
sort
of

were
you
speaking
about
she
asked
hydrogen
that
what
going
to
make
the
fireworks
it
combines
explosively
with
fluorine
the
combination
is
what
passes
for
combustion
here
the
result
is
hydrofluoric
acid
the
local
equivalent
of

see
the
metallic
core
of
this
planet
is
covered
much
less
thickly
than
that
of
terra
with
fluoride
rock
fluorspar
and
that
sort
of
thing
there
nothing
like
granite
here
for
instance
that
why
those
big
dunes
out
there
are
the
best
niflheim
has
in
the
way
of

the
subsurface
hydrogen
is
produced
when
the
acid
filters
down
through
the

he
came
forward
and
stood
behind

looking
down
at

his

stopped
at

this
assistant
was
not
human
he
was
a
biped
vaguely
humanoid
but
he
had
four
arms
and
a
face
like
a

and
except
for
some

on

he
was

up
into

a

of
five

really
from
five
deep
shafts
in
an
irregular
pentagon
half
a

across
blended
into
one
by
the
distance
an
instant
later
there
was
a
blinding
flash
like
and
a
huge
ball
of
varicolored
fire
belched
upward
leaving
a
series
of
to
float
more
slowly
after
it
that
fireball
flattened
then
spread
to
form
the
of
a

of

that
mounted
to

it
rose
twisting

the
next
the

it
was
all
the

and
one
of
the

could
do
together
to
keep
it
level
in
about
half
an
hour
the
large
young
man
told
the

the
real
fireworks
should
be
starting
what
coming
up
now
is
just
small
debris
from
the

when
the

get
down

enough
to
crack

open
the

come
up

then
steam

and
then
the

this
one
ought
to
be

as
the
one
we
shot
three

it
ought
to
be
every

in

even
this
much
was

watching

you
going

gomes
asked
i
wish
i
were
i
have
to
stay
over
and
make
another

in
a

or
so
and
i
had
about
all
of
niflheim
i
can
take
now
the
sooner
i
get
onto
a

where
they
do
ration
the

the
better
i
like
it
well
what
do
you
know
the
large

with
the

he
does
like
our
nice
planet
nice

gomes
muttered
something
they
call
terra
footstool
well
i
give
you
one
guess
who
uses
this
thing
to
prop
his
cloven
hoofs
on
when
are
you
going
to

the
girl
asked
him
terra
i
do
know
a
year
two
years
but
i
going
to
uller
on
the
next
ship
the
of
if
we
get
the
next
blast
off
in
time
they
want
me
to
design
some
improvements
on
a
couple
of
so
i
probably
see
you
when
i
get
there
here
she
comes
the

called
watch
the

the
pillar
of
fiery

still
boiling
up
from
where
the

had
gone
off
far
underground
was
being
violently
agitated
at
the
bottom
a
series
of
new
flashes
broke
out
lifting
and
spreading
the
incandescent
radioactive
gasses
and
then
a
great
gush
of
flame
rose
a
column
of
pure
hydrogen
must
have
rushed
up
into
the
vacuum
created
by
the
explosion
the
next
blast
of
flame
in
a
lateral
sheet
came
at
nearly
ten
thousand
feet
above
the
ground
and
great
rags
of
fire
changing
from
red
to
violet
and
back
through
the
spectrum
to
red
again
went
soaring
away
to
dissipate
in
the
upper
atmosphere
then
geysers
of
hot
ash
and
molten
rock
spouted
upward
some
of
the
debris
landed
almost
at
the
acid
river
to
the
we
started
a

too
the
martian
murillo
said
looking
at
the
instruments
about
six
big
cracks
opening
in
the
you
know
when
this
quiets
down
and
cools
off
we
have
more
ore
on
the
surface
than
we
can
handle
in
ten
years
and
more

we
could
have
mined
by
ordinary
means
in

about
four
miles
from
the
original
blast
another

began
with
a

that

the

said
going
to
a
kitbag
in
the
corner
of
the
cabin
and
getting
out
a
bottle
get
some
of
those
plastic
cups
over
there
somebody
this
one
calls
for
a
drink
that
right
gomes
said
you
do
something
once
it
may
be
an
accident
you
repeat
the
performance
and
it
a
success
he
began
pushing
papers
aside
on
his
desk
and
the
girl
in
the
coveralls
brought
drinking
cups
the
ulleran
in
the
background
rose
quickly
and
squeaked
apologetically
murillo
nodded
yes
of
course
gorkrink
no
need
for
you
to
stay
here
the
ulleran
went
out
closing
the
door
behind
him
that
taboo
against
ullerans
and
terrans
watching
each
other
eat
and
drink
murillo
said
what
is
that
part
of
their
religion
no
it
their
version
of
modesty
the
girl
replied
like
some
of
our
which
they
ca
even
begin
to
understand
but
you
were
speaking
to
him
in
lingua
terra
i
did
know
any
of
them
understood
it
gorkrink
does
murillo
said
uncorking
the
bottle
and
pouring
into
the
plastic
cups
none
of
them
can
speak
it
of
course
because
of
the
structure
of
their
vocal
organs
any
more
than
we
can
speak
their
languages
without
artificial
aids
but
i
can
talk
to
him
in
lingua
terra
without
having
to
put
one
of
those
damn
gags
in
my
mouth
and
he
can
pass
my
instructions
on
to
the
others
he
been
a
big
help
be
sorry
to
lose
him
lose
him
yes
his
year
up
he
going
back
to
uller
on
the
you
know
it
impossible
to
keep
some
trace
of

from

even
out

were
ulleran

they
had

from

instead
of

and
wide

filled
with
opalescent

for

on

was
unnecessary

von

had
seen
them
sleeping
in

open
with
their
bodies
covered
with
frost
or
freezing
rain
he
had
also
seen
them
wade
through
boiling
water
as
to
the
second
they
had
practically
no
they
were
all
of
the
same
gender
true
functional
hermaphrodites
any
individual
among
them
could
bear

the

of

individual
fifteen
years
ago
when
he
had
come
to
uller
as
a
former
terran
federation
captain
newly
commissioned
colonel
in
the
army
of
the
uller
company
it
had
taken
some
time
before
he
had
become
accustomed
to
the
detailing
of
a
and
a
couple
of
privates
out
of
each
platoon
for
duty
at
least
though
they
did
have
the
around
army
posts
on
uller
that
they
had
on
thor
where
he
had
last
been
stationed
an
airjeep
coming
in
out
of
the
sun
circled
the
fort
and
let
down
onto
the
terrace
next
to
von
schlichten
it
carried
a
bristle
of
and
two
of
the
eight
on
either
side
were
empty
and
freshly
the
duraglass
canopy
slid
back
and
the
crew
and
jumped
out
von
schlichten
knew
them
both
lieutenant
kendall
sergeant
garcia
he
greeted
good
afternoon
gentlemen
both
saluted
in
the
informal
manner
of
terran
soldiers
on
extraterrestrial
duty
and
returned
the
greeting
how
the
jeel
situation
he
asked
then
nodded
toward
the
fired
i
see
you
had
some
shooting
yes
sir
the
lieutenant
said
two
bands
of
them
we
sighted
the
first
coming
up
the
eastern
side
of
the
mountain
about
two
miles
this
side
of
the
blue
springs
we
got
about
half
of
them
with
and
the
rest
dived
into
a
big
we
had
to
use
two
rockets
on
them
and
then
had
to
let
down
and
pot
a
few
of
them
with
our
pistols
we
caught
the
second
band
in
that
little
punchbowl
place
about
a
mile
this
side
of
zortolk
old
fort
there
were
only
six
of
them
they
were
bunched
together
feeding
off
one
of
their
own
gang
i
say
the
way
we
been
keeping
them
up
in
the
high
rocks
they
been
eating
inside
the
family
quite
a
bit
lately
we
let
them
have
two
rockets
no
survivors
not
many
very
big
pieces
in
fact
we
let
down
at
zortolk
for
a
beer
after
that
and
captain
martinelli
told
us
that
one
of
his
jeeps
caught
what
he
thinks
was
the
same
band
that
was
down
off
the
mountain
and
ate
those
peasants
on
prince
neeldink
estate
by
god
i
glad
to
hear
that
there
been
a
perfect
hell
of
a
flap
about
that
business
before
the
terrans
came
to
uller
it
was
a
good
year
when
not
more
than
five
hundred
would
be
killed
and
eaten
by
jeel
cannibals
the
incident
of
two
nights
ago
had
been
the
first
of
its
kind
in
almost
six
months
but
the
nobleman
whose
serfs
had
been
eaten
was
practically
accusing
the
company
of
responsibility
for
the
crime
i
see
that
neeldink
is
informed
the
more
you
do
for
these
damned
geeks
the
more
they
expect
from
you
when
you
get
your
vehicle
lieutenant
suppose
you
buzz
back
to
where
you
that
first
gang
if
there
are
any
more
around
have
moved
in
for
the
free
meal
by
now
this
breakdown
of
the
taboo
against
eating
was
one
of
the
best
things
heard
from
the
project
for
some
time
he
turned
to
themistocles
in
about
two
weeks
get
a
little
together
say
ten
about
twenty
airjeeps
and
a
battalion
of
kragan
rifles
in
oh
yes
and
this
konkrook
fencibles
outfit
of
prince
jaizerd
they
can
be
used
for
beaters
and
to
block
escape
routes
he
turned
back
to
lieutenant
kendall
and
sergeant
garcia
good
work
boys
and
if
the
show
that
any
of
that
first
bunch
got
away
feel
too
badly
about
it
these
jeels
can
hide
on
the
top
of
a
he
climbed
into
the
followed
by
themistocles
and
hideyoshi
sergeant
harry
quong
and
corporal
hassan
bogdanoff
took
their
places
on
the
front
seat
the
car
lifted
turned
to
nose
into
the
wind
and
rose
in
a
slow
spiral
below
the
fort
grew
smaller
a
rectangle
of
masonry
overlooking
the
pass
a
gun
covering
each
approach
and
two
more
on
the
square
keep
to
cover
the
rocky
hogback
on
which
the
fort
had
been
built
with
the
flagpole
between
them
once
that
pole
had
lifted
a
banner
of
ragged
black
skin
bearing
the
device
of
the
kragan
whose
family
had
built
the
castle
now
it
carried
a
neat
rectangle
of
blue
bunting
emblazoned
with
the
wreathed
globe
of
the
terran
federation
and
below
that
the
pennant
which
bore
the
vermilion
trademark
of
the
chartered
uller
company
where
now
sir
harry
quong
asked
he
looked
at
his
watch
there
was
time
for
a
visit
to
zortolk
old
fort
ten
miles
to
the
north
at
the
next
pass
back
to
konkrook
to
the
island
the
nose
of
the
car
swung
east
by
south
the
rotors
began
humming
and
then
the
were
cut
in
the
car
turned
from
the
fort
and
the
mountains
and
shot
away
over
the
foothills
toward
the
coastal
plain
below
were
forests
with
new
foliage
of
the
second
growing
season
of
the
equatorial
year
veined
with
narrow
dirt
roads
and
spotted
with
occasional
clearings
farther
east
the
dirty
gray
woodsmoke
of
uller
marked
the
progress
of
the
it
took
forty
years
to
burn
the
forests
clear
back
to
the
flint
cliffs
by
the
time
the
burners
reached
the
mountains
the
new
trees
at
the
seaward
edge
would
be
ready
to
cut
off
to
the
south
he
could
see
the
dark
green
squares
where
the
hemlocks
and
norway
spruce
had
been
planted
by
the
company
with
a
little
chemical
fertilizer
they
were
doing
well
and
they
made
better
charcoal
than
the
native
wood
that
was
the
only
natural
fuel
on
uller
there
was
no
coal
of
course
since
fallen
timber
and
even
standing
dead
trees
petrified
in
a
matter
of
a
couple
of
years
there
was
too
much
silica
on
uller
and
not
enough
of
anything
else
what
would
be
on
terra
were
strata
of
silicified
wood
and
of
course
there
was
no
petroleum
there
was
less
charcoal
being
burned
now
than
formerly
the
uller
company
had
been
bringing
in
great
quantities
of
synthetic
and
had
been
setting
up
nuclear
furnaces
and
wherever
they
gained
a
foothold
on
the
planet
beyond
the
forests
came
the
farmlands
around
the
older
estates
thick
walls
of
flint
and
petrified
wood
had
been
built
and
wide
moats
dug
to
keep
out
the
shellosaurs
but
now
the
moats
were
dry
and
the
walls
falling
into
disrepair
some
of
the
newer
farms
land
devoted
to
agriculture
with
the
declining
demand
for
charcoal
had
neither
moats
nor
walls
that
was
the
company
too
the
huge
beasts
had
become
virtually
extinct
in
the
konk
isthmus
now
since
the
introduction
of
bazookas
and
recoilless
rifles
there
seemed
to
be
quite
a
bit
of
working
in
the
fields
and
big
contragravity
lorries
were
drifting
back
and
forth
scattering
fertilizer
mainly
nitrates
from
mimir
or
yggdrasill
there
were
still
a
good
number
of
plows
and
harrows
in
use
however
as
planets
went
uller
was
no
bargain
he
thought
sourly
at
times
he
wished
he
had
never
followed
the
lure
of
rapid
promotion
and
fantastically
high
pay
and
left
the
federation
regulars
for
the
army
of
the
uller
company
if
he
had
he
probably
be
a
colonel
at
five
thousand
sols
a
year
but
maybe
it
would
be
better
to
be
a
colonel
on
a
decent
planet
odin
with
its
two
moons
hugin
and
munin
and
its
wide
grasslands
and
its
evergreen
forests
that
looked
and
even
smelled
like
the
pinewoods
of
terra
or
baldur
with
mountains
and
clear
cold
lakes
and
rocky
rivers
dashing
under
great
trees
or
freya
where
the
people
were
human
to
the
last
degree
and
the
women
were
so
breathtakingly
beautiful
than
a
company
army
general
at
thousand
on
this
combination
icebox
furnace
and
stonepile
where
the
water
tasted
like
soapsuds
and
left
a
crackly
film
when
it
dried
where
the
temperature
ranged
from
pole
to
pole
between
two
hundred
and
fifty
and
minus
a
hundred
and
fifty
fahrenheit
and
the
ran
up
to
thirty
where
nothing
that
ran
or
swam
or
grew
was
fit
for
a
human
to
eat
and
where
the
people
of
course
there
were
worse
planets
than
uller
there
was
nidhog
cold
and
foggy
its
equatorial
zone
a
gloomy
marsh
and
the
rest
of
the
planet
locked
in
eternal
ice
there
was
bifrost
which
always
kept
the
same
face
turned
to
its
primary
one
side
blazingly
hot
and
the
other
close
to
absolute
zero
with
a
narrow
and
barely
habitable
twilight
zone
between
there
was
mimir
swarming
with
a
race
of
murderous
treacherous
utterly
vicious
or
niflheim
the
uller
company
had
the
franchise
for
niflheim
too
they
had
to
take
that
and
agree
to
exploit
the
planet
resources
in
order
to
get
the
franchise
for
uller
which
furnished
a
good
quick
measure
of
the
comparative
merits
of
the
two
ahead
the
city
of
konkrook
sprawled
along
the
delta
of
the
konk
river
and
extended
itself
inland
the
river
was
dry
now
except
in
spring
when
it
was
a
torrent
it
never
ran
more
than
a
trickle
and
not
at
all
this
late
in
the
northern
summer
the
aircar
lost
altitude
and
the
stopped
firing
they
came
gliding
in
over
the
suburbs
and
the
parks
over
the
low
dwellings
and
shops
the
lofty
temples
and
palaces
the
fantastically
twisted
towers
following
a
street
that
became
increasingly
mean
and
squalid
as
it
neared
the
industrial
district
along
the
waterfront
von

on
the
right
glanced
idly
down
puffing
slowly
on
his
cigarette
then
he
stiffened
the
muscles
around
his

eye
clamping
tighter
on
the
monocle
leaning
forward
he
punched

lightly
on

sergeant
let
have
a
look
at

again
he
directed
something
going

parked

in

the

made
a
twisting

and
came
back
more
slowly
colonel

was
using
the
binoculars
that
right
he
said
terrans
being
mobbed
two
of
them
backed
up
against

i

firing

was
punching
out

held
down
the

until
he
got
an
answer
von

in
car
over
konkrook
riot
on
fourth
avenue
just
off
street
no
terran
could
possibly
remember
the
names
of

streets
even
native

recruited
from
outside
found
the

easier
to
learn
and
remember

mobbing
a

of

i
going
down
now
to
do
what
i
can
to
help
send

give
it
to

as
it
happens
the
voice
of
somebody
at
the

bawling
orders
came
out
of
the
receiver
as
he
tossed
the
phone
forward
over
harry

quong
caught
it
and
began
speaking
rapidly
and
urgently
into
it
while
he
steered
with
the

von

took
one
of
the
spiked
out
of
the

in

had
already
drawn
his
pistol
he
shifted
it
to
his

hand
and
took
a
mace
in
his
right
the
colonel
looking
like
a
homicidally
infuriated
pixie
had
an
automatic
in
one
hand
and
a
long
dagger
in
the
other
harry

they
done
this
sort
of
work
before
bogdanoff
rose
into
the
and
swung
the

around
cutting
loose
quong
brought
the

in
fast
at
about
on
the
mob
between

they
left
a
swath
of
mangled
killed
wounded

stunned
natives
then
spinning
the

around
quong
set
it
down
hard
on

close

to

around
the

terrans
von

threw
back
the

and
jumped
out
of

and
behind
him
there
was
another
aircar
a
dark
maroon
civilian
job
at
the
curb
its
native

was
slumped
forward
over
the

a
short
sticking
out
of
his
neck
backed
against
the
closed
door
of
a
house
a
terran
with
white
hair
and
a
small

was
clubbing
futilely
with
an
empty

he
was
wounded
and
blood
was
streaming
over
his

his

added
recovering

slamming

on
the
narrow
saurian

the
ulleran
went
down
spurting
a
yellow

about

maced
another
of

one
of
the
natives
had
caught
the
wounded
terran
with
both
lower
hands
and
was
raising
a
dagger
with
his
upper
right
the
girl
in
the
fur
coat
swung
wildly
slashing
the
then
chopped
down
on
the
creature
neck
to
one
side
a
native
somewhat
better
dressed
than
the
others
to
the
extent
of
a
couple
of
belts
with
gold
ornaments
drew
a
terran
automatic
von
schlichten
hurled
his
mace
and
drew
his
pistol
thumbing
off
the
safety
as
he
swung
it
up
but
before
he
could
fire
hassan
bogdanoff
had
seen
and
swung
his
guns
around
the
double
burst
caught
the
native
in
the
chest
and
fairly
tore
him
apart
another
of
them
closed
with
the
girl
grabbing
her
right
arm
with
all
four
hands
and
biting
at
her
she
screamed
and
kicked
her
attacker
in
the
groin
where
an
ulleran
is
if
anything
even
more
vulnerable
than
a
terran
the
native
howled
hideously
and
von
schlichten
jumping
over
a
couple
of
corpses
shoved
the
muzzle
of
his
pistol
into
the
creature
open
mouth
and
pulled
the
trigger
blowing
its
head
apart
like
a
rotten
pumpkin
and
splashing
both
himself
and
the
girl
with
yellow
blood
and
brains
hideyoshi
jumping
forward
after
von
schlichten
stuck
his
dagger
into
the
neck
of
a
rioter
and
left
it
there
then
caught
the
girl
around
the
waist
with
his
free
arm
themistocles
dropped
his
mace
and
swung
the
man
onto
his
back
together
they
struggled
back
to
the
von
schlichten
covering
the
retreat
with
his
pistol
another
rioter
a
zirk
nomad
from
the
north
he
guessed
was
aiming
one
of
the
native
holding
the
globe
of
the
in
both
lower
hands
von
schlichten
shot
him
and
the
zirk
literally
blew
to
pieces
for
an
instant
he
wondered
how
the
small
of
a
explosive
could
accomplish
such
havoc
and
assumed
that
the
native
had
been
carrying
a
bomb
in
his
belt
then
another
explosion
tossed
fragmentary
corpses
nearby
and
another
and
another
glancing
quickly
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
four
coming
in
firing
with
and
they
swept
between
the
hovels
on
one
side
and
the
warehouses
on
the
other
strafing
the
mob
darted
up
to
a
thousand
feet
looped
and
came
swooping
back
and
this
time
there
were
three
long
behind
them
these
landed
in
the
hastily
cleared
street
and
began
disgorging
native
company
soldiers
kragan
mercenaries
he
noted
with
satisfaction
they
carried
a
modified
version
of
the
regular
terran
federation
infantry
rifle
stocked
and
sighted
to
conform
to
their
physical
peculiarities
with
long
triangular
bayonets
one
platoon
ran
forward
dropped
to
one
knee
and
began
firing
rapidly
into
what
was
left
of
the
mob
soldiers
can
deliver
a
simply
astonishing
volume
of
fire
particularly
when
armed
with
having
magazines
which
can
be
changed
with
the
lower
hands
without
lowering
the
weapon
there
was
a
clatter
of
shod
hoofs
and
a
company
of
the
king
of
konkrook
cavalry
came
trotting
up
on
their
mounts
some
of
these
charged
into
side
alleys
joyfully
lancing
and
cutting
down
fleeing
rioters
while
others
dismounted
three
tossing
their
reins
to
a
fourth
and
went
to
work
with
their
crossbows
von
schlichten
who
ordinarily
entertained
a
dim
opinion
of
the
king
of
konkrook
soldiery
admitted
grudgingly
that
it
was
smart
work
four
hands
were
a
big
help
in
using
a
crossbow
too
a
terran
captain
of
native
infantry
came
over
saluting
are
you
and
your
people
all
right
general
he
asked
von
schlichten
glanced
at
the
front
seat
of
his
car
where
harry
quong
a
pistol
in
his
right
hand
was
still
talking
into
the
and
hassan
bogdanoff
was
putting
fresh
belts
into
his
guns
then
he
saw
that
the
brigadier
and
the
colonel
had
gotten
the
wounded
man
into
the
car
the
girl
having
dropped
her
bolo
was
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
car
one
foot
heedlessly
in
what
was
left
of
an
ulleran
who
had
gotten
smashed
under
it
weak
with
nervous
reaction
we
seem
to
be
captain
pedolsky
very
smart
work
you
must
have
those
vehicles
of
yours
on
how
is
he
colonel
we
better
get
him
to
the
hospital
right
away
replied
i
think
he
has
a
concussion
harry
call
the
hospital
tell
them
what
the
score
is
and
tell
them
we
bringing
the
casualty
in
to
their
top
landing
stage
why
we
make
out
very
nicely
captain
you
better
stay
around
with
your
kragans
and
make
sure
that
these
geeks
of
king
jaikark
let
the
riot
flare
up
again
and
get
away
from
them
and
do
let
them
get
the
impression
that
they
can
maintain
order
around
here
without
our
help
the
company
would
like
to
see
that
attitude
discouraged
yes
sir
i
understand
captain
pedolsky
opened
the
pouch
on
his
belt
and
took
out
the
false
palate
and
without
which
no
terran
could
do
more
than
mouth
a
crude
and
barely
comprehensible
stuffing
the
gadget
into
his
mouth
he
turned
and
began
jabbering
orders
von
schlichten
helped
the
girl
into
the
car
placing
her
on
his
right
the
wounded
civilian
was
propped
up
in
the
left
corner
of
the
seat
and
colonel
and
took
the
the
driver
put
on
the
and
the
car
lifted
up
them
see
if
there
a
flask
and
a
in
the
door
pocket
next
to
you
he
said
i
think
miss
quinton
could
use
a
drink
the
girl
turned
even
in
her
present
disheveled
condition
she
was
beautiful
a
trifle
on
the
petite
side
with
black
hair
and
black
eyes
that
quirked
up
oddly
at
the
outer
corners
her
nails
were
and
spotted
with
little
gold
stars
evidently
a
new
feminine
fad
from
terra
i
certainly
could
general
how
did
you
know
my
name
you
been
on
uller
for
the
last
three
months
ever
since
the
of
got
in
from
niflheim
on
uller
there
are
enough
of
us
that
everybody
does
know
all
about
everybody
else
you
paula
quinton
you
an
extraterrestrial
sociographer
and
you
a
for
the
extraterrestrials
rights
association
like
mohammed
ferriera
here
he
took
the
cup
and
flask
from
themistocles
and
poured
her
a
drink
take
this
easy
now
baldur
a
hundred
and
fifty
proof
he
watched
her
sip
the
stuff
cautiously
cough
over
the
first
mouthful
and
then
get
the
rest
of
it
down
more
when
she
shook
her
head
he
stoppered
the
flask
and
relieved
her
of
the
cup
what
were
you
doing
in
that
district
anyhow
he
wanted
to
know
i
have
thought
mohammed
ferriera
would
have
had
more
sense
than
to
take
you
there
or
go
there
himself
for
that
matter
we
went
to
visit
a
friend
of
his
a
native
named
keeluk
who
seems
to
be
a
sort
of
combination
clergyman
and
labor
leader
she
replied
i
going
to
observe
labor
conditions
at
the
north
pole
mines
in
a
short
while
and
keeluk
was
going
to
give
me
letters
of
introduction
to
friends
of
his
at
skilk
with
the
aid
of
his
monocle
von
schlichten
managed
to
keep
a
straight
face
neither
nor
had
any
such
aid
the
african
rolled
his
eyes
and
the
grimaced
we
talked
with
keeluk
for
a
while
the
girl
said
and
when
we
came
out
we
found
that
our
driver
had
been
killed
and
a
mob
had
gathered
of
course
we
were
carrying
pistols
they
part
of
this
you
make
everybody
carry
along
with
the
and
the
ferriera
was
loaded
but
mine
was
when
they
rushed
us
i
shot
a
couple
of
them
and
then
picked
up
that
big
knife
that
why
you
still
alive
von
schlichten
commented
we
would
be
if
you
had
come
along
she
told
him
i
never
in
my
life
saw
anything
as
beautiful
as
you
coming
through
that
mob
swinging
that
well
i
never
saw
anything
much
more
beautiful
than
those
beginning
to
land
in
the
mob
von
schlichten
replied
the
aircar
swung
out
over
konkrook
channel
and
headed
toward
the
company
buildings
on
gongonk
island
and
the
company
airport
swarming
with
lorries
and
airboats
where
the
ten
paul
had
just
come
in
from
keegark
and
the
company
one
real
warship
the
cruiser
was
lifting
out
for
grank
in
the
north
down
at
the
southern
tip
of
the
island
the
globe
of
the
spaceship
of
from
niflheim
was
loading
with
cargo
for
terra
just
what
happened
while
you
and
ferriera
were
in
house
miss
quinton
hideyoshi
asked
trying
not
to
sound
official
was
keeluk
with
you
all
the
time
or
did
he
go
out
for
a
while
say
fifteen
or
twenty
minutes
before
you
left
why
yes
he
did
paula
quinton
looked
surprised
how
did
you
guess
it
you
see
a
dog
started
barking
behind
the
house
and
he
excused
himself
and
a
dog
von
schlichten
almost
shouted
the
other
officers
echoed
him
and
on
the
front
seat
harry
quong
said
why
yes
paula
quinton
eyes
widened
but
there
are
no
dogs
on
uller
except
a
few
owned
by
terrans
and
was
there
something
about
von
schlichten
had
the
and
was
calling
the
command
car
at
the
scene
of
the
riot
the
answered
von
schlichten
here
my
compliments
to
captain
pedolsky
and
tell
him
he
to
make
immediate
and
thorough
search
of
the
house
in
front
of
which
the
incident
occurred
and
adjoining
houses
for
his
information
that
keeluk
house
tell
him
to
look
for
traces
of
harrington
collie
or
any
of
the
other
terrestrial
animals
that
have
been
disappearing
that
goat
for
instance
or
those
rabbits
and
i
want
keeluk
brought
in
alive
and
in
condition
to
be
interrogated
i
send
more
troops
or
constabulary
to
help
you
he
handed
the
phone
to
you
take
care
of
that
end
of
it
them
you
know
who
can
be
spared
but
what
the
girl
began
that
why
you
were
attacked
he
told
her
keeluk
was
afraid
to
let
you
get
away
from
there
alive
to
report
hearing
that
dog
so
he
went
out
and
had
a
gang
of
thugs
rounded
up
to
kill
you
but
he
was
only
gone
five
minutes
in
five
minutes
i
can
put
all
the
troops
in
konkrook
into
action
keeluk
does
have
radio
or
tv
we
hope
but
he
has
his
forces
concentrated
and
he
has
a
pretty
good
staff
but
keeluk
a
friend
of
ours
he
knows
what
our
association
is
trying
to
do
for
his
people
so
he
shows
his
appreciation
by
setting
that
mob
on
you
look
he
has
a
lot
of
influence
in
that
section
when
you
were
attacked
why
he
out
trying
to
quiet
the
mob
when
they
jumped
you
you
tried
to
get
back
into
the
house
put
in
and
you
found
the
door
barred
against
you
yes
but
the
girl
looked
troubled
had
guessed
right
but
what
all
the
excitement
about
the
dog
what
is
it
the
sacred
of
the
uller
company
it
just
a
big
brown
collie
named
stalin
like
half
the
dogs
on
terra
somebody
stole
it
and
keeluk
was
keeping
it
and
we
want
to
know
why
we
do
like
geek
mysteries
not
when
they
lead
to
murderous
attacks
on
terrans
at
least
the
aircar
let
down
on
the
hospital
landing
stage
a
stretcher
was
waiting
with
a
terran
interne
and
two
ulleran
orderlies
they
got
the
mohammed
ferriera
out
of
the
car
you
better
go
with
them
yourself
miss
quinton
von
schlichten
advised
you
have
a
couple
of
bruises
and
bumps
a
couple
of
abrasions
too
where
those
geeks
grabbed
you
they
have
hides
like
sandpaper
and
better
have
that
coat
cleaned
before
that
goo
on
it
hardens
or
it
be
ruined
yes
you
have
a
lot
of
it
on
your
uniform
too
he
glanced
down
at
the
jacket
so
i
have
and
another
thing
those
letters
keeluk
was
going
to
give
you
the
ones
to
his
friends
in
skilk
did
you
get
them
she
felt
in
the
pocket
of
her
coat
yes
i
still
have
them
i
wish
you
let
colonel
have
a
look
at
them
there
may
be
more
to
them
than
you
think
hid
will
you
go
with
miss
quinton
ii
rakkeed
stalin
and
the
rev
keeluk
von
schlichten
in
a
fresh
uniform
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
in
sidney
harrington
office
harrington
and
eric
blount
the
faced
each
other
across
it
over
the
disc
of
an
ulleran
harrington
had
the
white
or
center
position
blount
and
considerably
younger
was
playing
black
and
his
pieces
were
closing
in
relentlessly
from
the
outer
rim
well
then
what
harrington
asked
von
schlichten
dropped
ash
from
his
cigarette
into
the
tray
that
served
all
three
of
them
nothing
much
he
replied
keeluk
bugged
out
as
soon
as
he
saw
my
car
let
down
we
picked
up
a
few
of
his
and
they
being
questioned
now
but
i
doubt
if
they
tell
us
anything
we
do
know
already
the
dog
had
been
kept
in
a
back
of
the
house
it
had
been
removed
probably
as
soon
as
keeluk
called
in
his
at
least
one
of
the
rabbits
had
been
kept
on
the
premises
too
some
time
ago
no
trace
of
the
goat
he
watched
blount
move
one
of
his
pieces
and
nodded
approvingly
the
riot
been
put
down
he
continued
but
we
keeping
two
companies
of
kragans
in
the
city
and
about
a
dozen
airjeeps
patrolling
the
section
from
eightieth
down
to
and
from
the
waterfront
back
to
eighth
avenue
there
is
also
the
equivalent
of
a
regiment
of
king
jaikark
infantry
spearmen
crossbowmen
and
a
few
riflemen
and
two
of
those
outsize
cavalry
companies
of
his
helping
hold
the
lid
down
they
making
mass
arrests
indiscriminately
more
slaves
for
jaikark
court
favorite
of
course
or
else
gurgurk
wants
them
to
use
for
patronage
blount
added
been
building
quite
a
political
organization
lately
getting
ready
to
shove
jaikark
off
the
throne
i
say
harrington
pushed
one
of
his
pieces
out
along
a
radial
line
toward
the
rim
blount
promptly
took
a
pawn
which
under
ulleran
rules
entitled
him
to
a
second
move
he
shifted
another
piece
a
sort
of
combination
knight
and
bishop
to
threaten
the
piece
harrington
had
moved
oh
gurgurk
would
dare
try
anything
like
that
the
said
he
knows
we
would
let
him
get
away
with
it
we
have
too
much
of
an
investment
in
king
jaikark
then
why
gurgurk
been
supporting
this
damned
rakkeed
blount
wanted
to
know
hastily
interposing
a
piece
gurgurk
can
follow
one
of
two
lines
of
policy
he
can
undertake
to
heave
jaikark
off
the
throne
and
seize
power
or
he
has
to
support
jaikark
on
the
throne
we
subsidizing
jaikark
rakkeed
has
been
preaching
this
crusade
against
the
terrans
and
against
jaikark
whom
we
control
gurgurk
has
been
subsidizing
rakkeed
you
have
any
proof
of
that
harrington
protested
my
intelligence
section
has
von
schlichten
put
in
we
can
give
sums
of
money
and
dates
and
the
names
of
the
intermediaries
through
whom
they
were
paid
to
rakkeed
eric
is
absolutely
correct
in
making
that
statement
personally
i
think
gurgurk
plan
is
something
like
this
rakkeed
will
stir
up
sentiment
here
in
konkrook
and
direct
it
against
our
puppet
jaikark
as
well
as
against
us
blount
said
when
the
outbreak
comes
jaikark
will
be
killed
and
then
gurgurk
will
step
in
seize
the
palace
and
use
the
royal
army
to
put
down
the
revolt
that
he
incited
in
the
first
place
that
will
put
him
in
the
position
of
the
friend
of
the
company
and
most
of
his
dupes
will
be
rounded
up
and
sold
as
slaves
and
king
gurgurk
pocket
the
proceeds
the
only
question
is
will
rakkeed
let
himself
be
used
that
way
i
think
rakkeed
bigger
than
gurgurk
ever
can
be
and
more
of
a
threat
to
the
company
everywhere
we
turn
rakkeed
at
the
bottom
of
whatever
happens
to
be
wrong
this
business
for
instance
one
of
rakkeed
followers
eric
you
have
rakkeed
on
the
brain
harrington
exclaimed
impatiently
then
moved
the
threatened
piece
counterclockwise
on
the
circle
where
he
had
placed
it
he
just
a
barbarian
eric
blount
moved
the
piece
that
had
taken
harrington
pawn
your
king
in
danger
he
warned
and
hitler
was
just
a
rakkeed
has
no
following
except
among
the
rabble
harrington
puffed
furiously
at
his
pipe
trying
to
figure
the
best
protection
for
his
king
you
just
think
he
has
blount
retorted
here
in
konkrook
always
entertained
by
one
or
another
of
the
big
nobles
they
probably
deprecate
his
but
they
just
love
his
politics
and
the
same
thing
at
keegark
and
at
the
free
cities
along
the
eastern
shore
the
last
time
rakkeed
was
in
konkrook
he
was
the
guest
of
the
keegarkan
ambassador
von
schlichten
stated
intelligence
got
that
from
a
spy
we
planted
among
the
embassy
servants
you
sure
this
spy
was
just
romancing
harrington
asked
you
get
so
confounded
many
wild
stories
about
rakkeed
three
days
after
he
was
reported
here
at
konkrook
he
was
reported
at
skilk
five
thousand
miles
away
said
to
be
having
an
audience
with
king
firkked
no
mystery
to
that
von
schlichten
said
he
travels
on
our
ships
in
disguise
on
the
be
a
good
idea
if
he
could
be
caught
at
it
some
time
blount
said
making
another
move
one
of
the
loading
ports
could
be
left
unlocked
by
carelessness
and
he
could
blunder
overboard
at
about
five
thousand
feet
he
watched
harrington
make
a
deceptively
move
sid
this
damn
dog
business
worries
me
worries
me
too
i
fond
of
that
mutt
and
god
only
knows
what
sort
of
stuff
he
been
getting
to
eat
and
i
hate
to
think
of
why
those
geeks
stole
him
too
well
at
risk
of
seeming
heartless
i
not
so
much
worried
for
stalin
as
i
am
about
why
keeluk
was
hiding
him
and
why
he
was
willing
to
murder
the
only
two
terrans
in
konkrook
who
trust
him
to
prevent
our
finding
out
that
he
had
him
a
keeluk
a
clergyman
von
schlichten
quoted
he
another
cigarette
and
stubbed
out
the
old
one
maybe
the
rev
keeluk
wanted
stalin
for
sacramental
purposes
blount
looked
up
sharply
ritual
killing
he
asked
or
sympathetic
magic
von
schlichten
shrugged
take
your
choice
maybe
rakkeed
wanted
the
dog
to
kill
before
a
congregation
of
his
followers
killing
us
by
proxy
or
in
effigy
or
maybe
they
think
we
worship
stalin
and
getting
control
of
him
would
give
them
power
over
us
i
wish
we
knew
a
little
more
about
ulleran
psychology
that
was
the
first
time
he
made
that
wish
even
if
sex
the
paramount
psychological
factor
the
ancient
freudians
believed
it
was
an
extremely
important
one
and
on
uller
most
of
the
fundamental
terms
of
terran
psychology
were
meaningless
at
the
same
time
the
average
ulleran
probably
had
complexes
and
neuroses
that
would
have
had
freud
talking
to
himself
and
they
certainly
indulged
in
practices
that
would
have
even
stood
hair
on
end
one
thing
blount
said
it
does
take
any
ulleran
psychologist
to
know
that
about
eighty
percent
of
them
hate
us
poisonously
oh
rubbish
harrington
blew
the
exclamation
out
around
his
with
a
gush
of
smoke
a
few
fanatics
hate
us
and
a
few
merchants
who
lost
money
when
we
replaced
this
primitive
barter
economy
of
theirs
but
of
them
have
benefited
enormously
from
us
and
continue
to
benefit
and
hate
us
more
deeply
with
each
new
benefit
blount
added
they
resent
everything
we
done
for
them
yes
this
spaceport
proposition
of
king
orgzild
of
keegark
looks
like
it
now
does
it
harrington
retorted
he
hates
and
resents
us
so
much
that
he
offered
us
a
spaceport
at
his
city
what
it
going
to
cost
him
blount
asked
he
furnishes
the
land
sequestered
from
the
estate
of
some
noble
he
executed
for
treason
and
the
labor
all
forced
we
furnish
the
structural
steel
the
the
engineering
we
get
a
spaceport
we
really
need
and
he
gets
all
the
business
it
bring
to
keegark
considering
the
fact
that
rakkeed
is
a
welcome
guest
at
his
embassy
here
and
at
the
royal
palace
at
keegark
i
beginning
to
wonder
if
he
is
fomenting
trouble
for
us
here
at
konkrook
to
make
us
willing
to
move
our
main
base
to
his
city
he
made
a
move
instantly
harrington
slashed
out
from
the
middle
of
the
board
with
one
of
his
pieces
and
took
a
piece
then
moved
again
now
look
whose
king
threatened
he
crowed
yes
i
see
blount
brought
a
piece
clockwise
around
the
board
and
took
the
threatening
piece
then
moved
again
i
hope
you
see
whose
king
threatened
now
harrington
swore
reached
out
to
move
a
piece
and
then
jerked
his
hand
back
as
though
the
piece
were
radioactive
for
a
while
he
sat
puffing
his
pipe
and
staring
at
the
board
in
fact
orgzild
so
sure
that
we
going
to
accept
his
offer
that
he
started
building
two
new
to
handle
the
additional
that
result
from
the
increased
business
blount
continued
where
he
getting
the
plutonium
von
schlichten
asked
where
can
he
get
it
harrington
replied
he
just
bought
four
tons
of
it
from
us
off
the
of
that
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
plutonium
blount
said
i
wonder
if
he
might
have
some
idea
of
what
else
plutonium
can
be
used
for
beside
generating
power
oh
god
i
hope
not
harrington
exclaimed
you
going
to
get
me
started
seeing
burglars
under
the
bed
next
maybe
there
are
burglars
blount
said
pointing
with
his
to
harrington
threatened
king
ca
you
do
something
about
that
sid
then
he
turned
to
von
schlichten
before
we
get
off
the
subject
how
about
those
letters
the
rev
keeluk
gave
to
the
quinton
girl
all
addressed
to
skilkans
known
to
be
rakkeed
disciples
and
rabidly
von
schlichten
replied
we
radioed
the
list
to
skilk
colonel
our
intelligence
man
there
teleprinted
us
back
a
lot
of
material
on
them
that
looks
like
the
newgate
calendar
we
turned
the
letters
themselves
over
to
doc
petrie
the
ulleran
philology
sharp
who
is
a
pretty
fair
cryptanalyst
he
could
find
any
indications
of
cipher
but
there
was
a
lot
of
gossip
about
keeluk
friends
and
parishioners
which
might
have
arbitrary
i
going
to
explain
the
situation
to
miss
quinton
and
advise
her
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
any
of
the
people
keeluk
gave
her
letters
to
harrington
had
gotten
his
king
temporarily
out
of
danger
losing
a
piece
doing
it
think
she
listen
to
you
he
asked
these
rights
association
people
are
a
lot
of
blasted
fanatics
themselves
we
a
gang
of
imperialistic
sons
of
bitches
in
their
book
and
anything
we
say
sure
to
be
a
lie
oh
they
not
as
bad
as
all
that
i
never
met
the
girl
before
today
but
old
mohammed
ferriera
a
decent
bloke
and
their
association
really
done
a
lot
of
good
for
one
thing
they
put
an
end
to
the
peonage
system
on
yggdrasill
and
i
know
what
conditions
were
like
there
before
they
did
a
calculating
look
came
into
harrington
eye
he
puffed
slowly
at
his
pipe
and
slid
a
piece
from
the
center
toward
the
sector
of
the
board
nearest
him
blount
whistled
softly
and
made
a
quick
carlos
did
you
say
she
told
you
she
was
going
to
skilk
in
the
near
future
harrington
asked
well
look
here
you
going
up
that
way
yourself
with
that
battalion
of
kragans
on
the
why
do
you
invite
her
to
make
the
trip
with
you
you
can
be
quite
attractive
to
young
ladies
when
you
try
and
she
be
grateful
for
that
rescue
this
afternoon
which
is
always
a
good
foundation
maybe
you
can
plant
a
couple
of
ideas
where
they
do
the
most
good
only
been
here
for
three
months
since
the
got
in
from
niflheim
you
know
and
i
know
and
we
all
know
that
there
are
a
lot
of
things
up
there
at
the
polar
mines
that
would
look
like
hell
to
anybody
who
did
understand
local
conditions
well
miss
quinton
company
wo
be
any
particularly
heavy
cross
for
me
to
bear
von
schlichten
replied
i
wo
guarantee
anything
of
course
the
on
the
table
whistled
several
times
harrington
swore
laid
down
his
pipe
and
got
up
brushing
ashes
from
the
front
of
his
coat
he
flipped
a
switch
and
spoke
into
the
box
governor
a
voice
replied
out
of
it
there
a
geek
procession
just
landed
from
a
in
front
and
is
coming
up
the
roadway
to
company
house
a
platoon
of
jaikark
household
guards
with
rifles
the
spear
of
state
a
royal
litter
about
thirty
geek
nobles
on
foot
a
another
platoon
of
riflemen
if
you
say
the
last
syllable
quick
enough
that
be
gurgurk
coming
to
tell
us
how
unhappy
his
sodden
and
inebriated
geekship
is
about
that
fracas
on
street
harrington
said
the
will
contain
the
customary
indemnity
at
the
current
market
quotation
have
gurgurk
and
party
admitted
all
but
the
give
him
an
honor
guard
of
our
kragans
and
keep
his
own
outside
take
them
to
the
reception
hall
and
hold
them
there
till
i
signal
from
the
audience
hall
and
then
herd
them
in
he
came
back
and
made
a
move
immediately
blount
took
one
of
his
pieces
moved
again
took
another
and
made
the
third
move
to
which
he
was
entitled
i
mate
you
in
four
moves
he
predicted
want
to
play
it
out
before
we
go
down
sure
what
time
to
a
geek
gurgurk
think
we
were
worried
about
something
if
we
did
keep
him
waiting
good
lord
you
do
have
me
over
a
barrel
eric
iii

heads
sidney
harrington
sat
on
the
comfortably
upholstered
bench
on
the
dais
of
the
audience
hall
flanked
by
von
schlichten
and
eric
blount
he
did
look
particularly
regal
even
on
that
high
seat
with
his
ruddy
outdoorsman
face
and
his
ragged
gray
mustache
and
his
old
tweed
coat
spotted
with
he
might
have
been
any
of
the
neighbors
of
von
boyhood
in
the
argentine
but
then
to
a
terran
any
of
the
kings
of
uller
would
have
looked
like
a
freak
birth
in
a
at
a
zoo
it
was
hard
to
guess
what
impression
harrington
would
make
on
an
ulleran
he
took
the
false
palate
and
officially
designated
as
an
enunciator
ulleran
and
colloquially
as
a
out
of
his
coat
pocket
and
shoved
it
into
his
mouth
von
schlichten
and
blount
put
in
theirs
and
harrington
pressed
the
with
his
toe
after
a
brief
interval
the
wide
doors
at
the
other
end
of
the
hall
slid
open
and
the
konkrookan
notables
attended
by
a
dozen
company
and
a
guard
of
kragan
rifles
entered
the
advanced
in
two
columns
between
them
marched
an
unclad
and
heavily
armed
native
carrying
an
ornate
spear
with
a
blade
upright
in
front
of
him
with
all
four
hands
it
was
the
konkrookan
spear
of
state
it
represented
the
of
king
jaikark
behind
it
stalked
gurgurk
the
konkrookan
equivalent
of
prime
minister
or
grand
vizier
he
wore
a
gold
helmet
and
a
thing
like
a
made
of
gold
wire
and
carried
a
long
sword
with
a
grip
a
pair
of
terran
automatics
built
for
a
hand
with
six
fingers
and
a
pair
of
matched
daggers
he
was
considerably
past
the
ulleran
prime
of
life
seventy
or
eighty
to
judge
from
the
worn
appearance
of
his
opal
teeth
the
color
of
his
skin
and
the
predominantly
reddish
tint
of
his
an
immature
ulleran
would
be
a
very
light
gray
white
under
the
arms
and
his
would
run
from
white
to
pale
yellow
the
retinue
of
nobles
behind
gurgurk
ran
through
the
whole
spectrum
from
a
princeling
who
was
almost
to
old
ghroghrank
the
keegarkan
ambassador
who
was
even
blacker
and
more
than
gurgurk
all
of
them
carried
about
as
much
ironmongery
as
the
prime
minister
the
pistols
were
all
terran
and
the
swords
and
daggers
were
mostly
made
either
on
terra
or
at
the
on
volund
four
slaves
brought
up
the
rear
carrying
an
ornately
inlaid
box
on
poles
when
the
reached
the
exact
middle
of
the
hall
he
halted
and
grounded
his
with
a
thump
gurgurk
came
up
and
halted
a
couple
of
paces
behind
and
to
the
left
of
the
spear
and
all
the
other
nobles
drew
up
in
two
curved
lines
some
ten
paces
to
the
rear
with
considerable
pushing
and
jostling
and
a
argument
with
overtones
of
about
precedence
all
that
is
but
ghroghrank
and
another
noble
who
came
up
and
planted
themselves
beside
gurgurk
von
schlichten
regarded
the
assemblage
sourly
through
his
monocle
maybe
sid
harrington
look
regal
after
all
the
rose
slowly
and
descended
from
the
dais
advancing
to
within
ten
paces
of
the
spear
von
schlichten
and
blount
accompanying
him
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
von
schlichten
watched
a
couple
of
kragan
mercenaries
with
move
unobtrusively
to
positions
from
whence
they
could
if
necessary
spray
the
visitors
with
bullets
without
endangering
the
terrans
welcome
gurgurk
harrington
gibbered
through
his
false
palate
the
company
is
honored
by
this
visit
i
come
in
the
name
of
my
royal
master
his
sublime
and
ineffable
majesty
jaikark
the
seventeenth
king
of
konkrook
and
of
all
the
lands
of
the
konk
isthmus
gurgurk
squeaked
and
clicked
i
have
the
honor
to
bring
with
me
the
lord
ghroghrank
ambassador
of
king
orgzild
of
keegark
to
the
court
of
my
royal
master
and
i
ghroghrank
said
after
being
suitably
welcomed
am
honored
to
be
accompanied
by
prince
gorkrink
special
envoy
from
my
master
his
royal
and
imperial
majesty
king
orgzild
who
is
in
your
city
to
receive
the
shipment
of
my
royal
master
has
been
honored
to
be
permitted
to
purchase
from
the
company
more
protocol
about
welcoming
gorkrink
then
gurgurk
cleared
his
throat
with
a
series
of
barking
sounds
my
royal
master
his
sublime
and
ineffable
majesty
is
prostrated
with
grief
he
stated
solemnly
were
his
sorrow
not
so
overwhelming
he
would
have
come
in
his
own
sacred
person
to
express
the
pain
and
shame
which
he
feels
that
people
of
the
company
should
be
set
upon
and
endangered
in
the
streets
of
the
royal
city
if
he
were
doped
to
the
ears
von
schlichten
substituted
mentally
there
was
a
native
drug
which
had
on
its
users
the
combined
effects
of
hashish
heroin
and
yohimbine
jaikark
and
all
his
court
circle
were
addicts
he
probably
had
even
heard
of
the
riot
the
soldiers
of
his
sublime
and
ineffable
majesty
came
most
promptly
to
the
aid
of
the
troops
of
the
company
did
they
not
general
von
schlichten
harrington
asked
within
minutes
your
excellency
von
schlichten
replied
gravely
their
promptness
valor
and
efficiency
were
most
exemplary
gurgurk
spoke
at
length
expressing
himself
as
delighted
on
behalf
of
his
royal
master
at
hearing
such
high
praise
from
so
distinguished
a
soldier
eric
blount
then
contributed
a
short
speech
beseeching
the
gods
that
the
deep
and
beautiful
friendship
existing
between
the
chartered
uller
company
and
his
sublime
etcetera
would
continue
unimpaired
and
that
his
sublime
etcetera
would
enjoy
long
life
and
peaceful
reign
managing
by
a
trick
of
konkrookan
grammar
to
imply
that
the
second
would
be
conditional
upon
the
first
the
keegarkan
ambassador
then
spoke
his
piece
expressing
on
behalf
of
king
orgzild
the
deepest
regret
that
the
people
of
the
company
should
be
so
molested
and
managing
to
hint
that
things
like
that
simply
happen
at
keegark
the
prince
gorkrink
then
spoke
briefly
in
sympathy
for
the
great
and
good
friend
of
all
ulleran
peoples
mohammed
ferriera
who
had
been
injured
and
hoping
that
he
would
soon
enjoy
full
health
again
he
also
managed
to
convey
king
orgzild
pleasure
at
having
obtained
the
plutonium
von
schlichten
noticed
that
a
few
of
his
more
recent
were
slightly

a
sure
sign
that
he
had
not
long
ago
been
exposed
to
the
air
which
men
and
geeks
alike
breathed
on
niflheim
when
a
geek
prince
hired
out
as
a
laborer
for
a
year
on
niflheim
he
did
so
for
only
one
purpose
to
learn
terran
technologies
gurgurk
then
announced
that
so
enormous
a
crime
against
the
friends
of
his
sublime
etcetera
had
not
been
allowed
to
go
unpunished
signaling
behind
him
with
one
of
his
lower
hands
for
the
box
to
be
brought
forward
the
slaves
carried
it
to
the
front
set
it
down
and
opened
it
taking
from
it
a
rug
which
they
spread
on
the
floor
on
this
from
the
box
they
placed
newly
severed
heads
in
four
neat
rows
they
had
all
been
freshly
scrubbed
and
polished
but
they
still
smelled
like
crushed
cockroaches
the
three
terrans
looked
at
them
gravely
a
heads
was
standard
payment
for
an
attack
in
which
no
terran
had
been
killed
ostensibly
they
were
the
heads
of
the
ringleaders
in
practice
they
were
usually
lopped
from
the
first
prisoners
or
slaves
at
hand
without
regard
for
whether
the
victims
had
even
heard
of
the
crime
which
they
were
expiating
if
the
rights
association
were
really
serious
about
the
rights
of
these
geeks
they
advocate
booting
out
all
these
native
princes
and
turning
the
whole
planet
over
to
the
company
that
had
been
the
terran
federation
idea
from
the
beginning
why
else
give
the
chief
representative
the
title
of
there
was
another
long
speech
from
gurgurk
with
the
nobles
behind
him
murmuring
antiphonal
agreement
standard
procedure
for
which
there
was
a
standard
pun
geek
chorus
and
a
speech
of
response
from
sid
harrington
standing
stiffly
through
the
whole
rigamarole
von
schlichten
waited
for
it
to
end
as
finally
it
did
they
walked
back
from
the
door
whence
they
had
escorted
the
delegation
and
stood
looking
down
at
the
saurian
heads
on
the
rug
harrington
raised
his
voice
and
called
to
a
kragan
sergeant
whose
chevrons
were
painted
on
all
four
arms
take
this
carrion
out
and
stuff
it
in
the
incinerator
he
ordered
if
any
of
you
think
you
can
clean
up
this
rug
and
this
box
welcome
to
them
wait
a
moment
von
schlichten
told
the
sergeant
then
he
disgorged
and
pouched
his
see
that
head
there
he
asked
rolling
it
over
with
his
toe
i
killed
that
geek
myself
with
my
pistol
while
them
and
hid
were
getting
ferriera
into
the
car
miss
quinton
killed
that
one
with
the
bolo
see
where
she
chopped
him
on
the
back
of
the
neck
the
cut
that
took
off
the
head
was
a
little
low
and
missed
it
and
hid
stuck
a
knife
in
that
one
he
walked
around
the
rug
turning
heads
over
with
his
foot
this
was
they
just
slashed
off
heads
at
the
scene
of
the
riot
i
do
like
this
butchery
of
slaves
and
petty
thieves
any
better
than
anybody
else
but
this
i
do
like
either
six
months
ago
gurgurk
would
have
tried
to
pull
anything
like
this
now
he
laughing
up
his
sleeve
at
us
that
what
i
been
preaching
all
along
eric
blount
took
up
after
him
these
geeks
need
having
the
fear
of
terra
thrown
into
them
oh
nonsense
eric
you
just
as
bad
as
carlos
here
harrington
next
you
be
saying
that
we
ought
to
depose
jaikark
and
take
control
ourselves
well
what
wrong
with
that
for
an
idea
von
schlichten
demanded
do
you
think
we
could
our
kragans
could
go
through
that
army
of
jaikark
like
fast
neutrons
through
my
god
harrington
exploded
do
let
me
hear
that
kind
of
talk
again
we
not
we
employees
of
a
business
concern
here
to
make
money
honestly
by
exchanging
goods
and
services
with
these
people
he
turned
and
walked
away
out
of
the
audience
hall
leaving
von
schlichten
and
blount
to
watch
the
removal
of
the
you
know
i
went
a
little
too
far
von
schlichten
confessed
or
too
fast
rather
he
got
to
be
conditioned
to
accept
that
idea
we
ca
go
too
slowly
either
blount
replied
if
we
wait
for
him
to
change
his
mind
it
be
the
same
as
waiting
for
him
to
retire
and
that
be
waiting
too
long
von
schlichten
nodded
seriously
did
you
notice
the
green
specks
in
the
hide
of
that
prince
gorkrink
he
asked
he
just
come
back
from
niflheim
not
on
the
i
do
think
probably
on
the
three
months
ago
and
he
here
to
get
that
plutonium
and
ship
it
to
keegark
on
the
paul
blount
considered
i
wonder
just
what
he
learned
on
niflheim
i
wonder
just
what
going
on
at
keegark
von
schlichten
said
orgzild
pulled
down
a
regular
iron
curtain
you
know
four
of
our
best
native
intelligence
operatives
have
been
murdered
in
keegark
in
the
last
three
months
and
six
more
have
just
vanished
there
well
i
going
there
in
a
few
days
myself
to
talk
to
orgzild
about
this
spaceport
deal
blount
said
i
have
a
talk
with
hendrik
lemoyne
and
mackinnon
and
i
see
what
i
can
find
out
for
myself
well
let
go
have
a
drink
von
schlichten
suggested
consulting
his
watch
about
time
for
a
cocktail
iv
if
you
read
it
in
von
schlichten
and
blount
entered
the
bar
together
the
broadway
room
decorated
in
gleaming
plastics
and
chromium
in
enthusiastic
if
slightly
inaccurate
imitation
of
a
first
century
new
york
nightclub
there
were
no
native
servants
to
spoil
the
illusion
such
as
it
was
the
service
was
fully
automatic
going
to
a
bartending
machine
von
schlichten
dialed
the
cocktail
they
had
decided
upon
and
inserted
his
key
to
charge
the
drinks
to
his
account
filling
a
jug
as
they
turned
away
they
almost
collided
with
hideyoshi
and
paula
quinton
the
girl
wore
a
gown
to
conceal
a
bandage
on
her
right
wrist
and
her
face
was
rather
heavily
powdered
in
spots
otherwise
she
looked
none
the
worse
for
recent
experiences
well
you
seem
to
have
gotten
yourself
repaired
miss
quinton
he
greeted
her
feel
better
now
miss
quinton
this
is
blount
eric
miss
paula
quinton
delighted
miss
quinton
blount
said
carlos
tells
us
he
found
you
standing
over
poor
mohammed
ferriera
fighting
like
a
commando
how
is
mohammed
by
the
way
no
danger
i
hope
we
all
like
him
mohammed
ferriera
was
still
unconscious
the
girl
reported
he
had
a
minor
concussion
but
the
medics
were
not
greatly
disturbed
and
expected
him
to
be
fully
recovered
in
a
few
weeks
von
schlichten
invited
her
and
her
escort
to
join
him
and
blount
colonel
was
carrying
a
cocktail
jug
and
a
couple
of
glasses
finding
a
table
out
of
the
worst
of
the
noise
they
all
sat
down
together
i
suppose
you
think
it
a
joke
our
being
nearly
murdered
by
the
people
we
came
to
help
paula
began
a
trifle
defensively
not
a
very
funny
joke
von
schlichten
told
her
it
been
played
on
us
till
it
lost
its
humor
yes
geek
ingratitude
an
old
story
to
all
of
us
blount
agreed
you
stay
on
this
planet
very
long
and
you
see
what
i
mean
you
call
them
that
too
she
asked
as
though
disappointed
in
him
maybe
if
you
stopped
calling
them
geeks
they
would
resent
you
the
way
they
do
you
know
that
a
nasty
name
in
the
first
century
it
designated
a
degraded
person
who
performed
some
sort
of
revolting
public
exhibition
biting
off
live
chickens
heads
in
a
sideshow
act
hideyoshi
supplied
when
you
get
up
north
watch
how
the
peasants
kill
these
little
things
like
iguanas
that
they
raise
for
food
that
is
the
reason
though
von
schlichten
said
as
we
use
it
the
word
pure
onomatopoeia
you
learned
some
of
the
languages
you
know
what
they
sound
like
as
far
as
that
goes
you
know
what
the
geek
name
for
a
terran
is
blount
asked
she
looked
puzzled
for
a
moment
then
slipped
in
her
enunciator
even
in
the
absence
of
any
native
she
used
her
handkerchief
to
mask
the
act
suddabit
she
said
distinctly
taking
out
the
she
put
it
away
why
that
exactly
how
pronounce
it
and
do
tell
me
you
have
heard
it
before
said
the
geeks
were
screaming
it
at
you
over
on
street
this
afternoon
kill
the
terrans
that
rakkeed
the
prophet
whole
gospel
so
you
see
eric
blount
rammed
home
the
moral
this
is
just
another
case
of
nobody
with
any
right
to
call
anybody
else
kettle
black
cigarette
thank
you
she
leaned
toward
the
had
snapped
into
being
i
suspect
that
of
being
a
principle
you
like
me
to
bear
in
mind
at
the
polar
mines
when
i
see
let
say
some
laborer
being
beaten
by
a
couple
of
overseers
with
three
foot
lengths
of
steel
cable
well
you
could
also
remember
that
a
native
skin
is
about
half
an
inch
thick
and
a
good
deal
tougher
than
a
human
von
schlichten
told
her
and
it
would
hurt
any
if
you
found
out
how
these
laborers
are
treated
at
home
mostly
they
serfs
hired
from
the
big
landowners
it
a
fact
you
can
easily
verify
that
permission
to
join
the
at
the
polar
mines
is
regarded
as
a
privilege
granted
as
a
reward
or
denied
as
a
punishment
and
most
of
the
geek
landowners
are
bitterly
critical
of
the
way
we
treat
our
labor
at
the
mines
they
claim
we
make
them
dissatisfied
with
the
treatment
they
get
at
home
of
course
they
always
glad
to
have
the
peasants
taken
off
their
hands
during
a
slack
agricultural
season
blount
added
and
we
train
workers
to
handle
contragravity
i
wo
deny
that
there
a
lot
of
unnecessary
brutality
on
the
part
of
the
native
foremen
and
overseers
which
we
trying
gradually
to
eliminate
you
have
to
remember
though
that
we
dealing
with
a
naturally
brutal
race
of
course
mistreatment
of
native
labor
is
always
blamed
on
other
natives
never
on
the
gentle
and
kindly
terrans
she
replied
been
sop
on
every
planet
our
association
had
any
experience
with
now
look
you
just
came
here
from
niflheim
von
schlichten
objected
the
company
employs
quite
a
few
geeks
there
how
much
brutality
did
you
run
into
there
well
i
must
admit
the
ullerans
who
work
there
are
very
well
treated
except
that
i
do
think
it
right
to
employ
any
people
with
silicone
where
they
going
to
breathe
air
nobody
ought
to
be
employed
on
that
planet
hideyoshi
declared
i
did
a
hitch
there
when
i
was
first
commissioned
in
the
company
service
i
put
in
two
years
there
too
blount
supported
him
and
i
might
add
that
that
a
year
longer
than
any
ulleran
native
is
ever
allowed
to
spend
on
niflheim
you
know
what
the
setup
is
there
do
you
the
terran
federation
space
navy
discovered
and
explored
both
uller
and
niflheim
which
made
both
planets
public
domain
the
company
was
originally
formed
to
exploit
uller
alone
but
the
federation
insisted
that
both
planets
would
have
to
be
franchised
to
the
same
company
they
wanted
niflheim
exploited
mainly
because
of
the
there
as
it
turned
out
the
company
making
as
much
money
out
of
niflheim
as
we
are
out
of
uller
what
you
miss
is
this
von
schlichten
pointed
out
on
niflheim
there
are
about
a
thousand
terrans
and
not
more
than
five
hundred
geeks
all
employed
on
and
in
the
mines
on
the
planet
itself
working
directly
under
terran
supervision
we
use
them
because
they
have
four
hands
and
in
the
contragravity
armor
that
necessary
there
they
can
manipulate
more
controls
and
do
more
things
at
once
than
we
can
here
on
uller
at
the
polar
mines
there
are
about
ten
thousand
geeks
working
under
five
hundred
terrans
and
most
of
the
latter
are
engineers
or
technicians
who
do
do
supervisory
work
so
we
have
to
use
native
foremen
and
they
guilty
of
what
mistreatment
the
workers
suffer
and
remember
too
added
work
at
the
polar
mines
can
only
go
on
for
about
two
months
out
of
the
year
to
at
the
arctic
and
to
at
the
antarctic
naturally
things
have
to
be
done
in
a
hurry
and
under
pressure
well
why
do
you
work
mines
at
the
poles
are
there
mineral
deposits
in
places
where
you
can
work
all
year
not
as
rich
or
as
accessible
blount
said
you
know
what
the
seasons
are
like
at
the
poles
of
this
planet
the
temperature
will
range
from
about
fahrenheit
in
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
below
in
winter
there
the
most
intense
sort
of
thermal
erosion
you
can
imagine
the
melts
in
the
spring
to
a
sea
which
boils
away
completely
by
the
middle
of
the
summer
there
will
be
violent
circular
storms
of
hot
wind
blowing
away
the
light
sand
and
dust
and
leaving
the
heavier
particles
of
metallic
ores
and
metals
behind
then
when
the
winds
fall
we
move
in
for
a
couple
of
months
it
is
really
mining
or
even
quarrying
we
just
scoop
up
ore
from
the
surface
load
it
onto
and
fly
it
down
to
skilk
and
krink
and
grank
where
it
smelted
through
the
winter
the
natives
run
the
smelters
use
the
heat
to
thaw
frozen
food
for
themselves
and
their
livestock
while
they
melting
the
ore
in
the
north
metallurgy
and
have
always
been
combined
that
way
yes
if
you
think
the
natives
who
work
at
the
mines
feel
themselves
you
might
propose
closing
them
down
entirely
and
see
what
the
native
reaction
would
be
von
schlichten
told
her
independently
hired
free
workers
can
make
themselves
rich
by
native
standards
in
a
couple
of
seasons
many
of
the
serfs
pick
up
enough
money
from
us
in
to
buy
their
freedom
after
one
season
well
if
the
company
doing
so
much
good
on
this
planet
how
is
it
that
this
native
rakkeed
the
one
you
call
the
mad
prophet
is
able
to
find
such
a
following
paula
demanded
there
must
be
something
wrong
somewhere
that
a
fair
question
blount
replied
inverting
a
cocktail
jug
over
his
glass
to
extract
the
last
few
drops
when
we
came
to
uller
we
found
a
culture
roughly
like
that
of
europe
during
the
seventh
century
or
more
closely
like
that
of
japan
before
the
beginning
of
the
first
century
a
we
initiated
a
technological
and
economic
revolution
here
and
such
revolutions
have
their
casualties
too
a
number
of
classes
and
groups
got
squeezed
pretty
badly
like
the
and
on
terra
by
the
invention
of
the
automobile
or
the
coal
and
hydroelectric
interests
when
direct
conversion
of
nuclear
energy
to
electric
current
was
developed
or
the
railroads
and
steamship
lines
at
the
time
of
the
discovery
of
the
naturally
there
a
lot
of
on
the
part
of
merchants
and
artisans
who
were
able
or
willing
to
adapt
themselves
to
changing
conditions
they
all
backing
rakkeed
and
yelling
suddabit
now
you
know
it
a
shame
that
geek
messiah
is
a
smart
crook
instead
of
an
honest
fanatic
he
could
take
in
the
equivalent
of
a
couple
of
million
sols
a
year
off
the
north
uller
merchants
and
the
equatorial
zone
shipowners
but
it
is
a
fact
which
not
even
rakkeed
can
successfully
deny
that
we
raised
the
general
living
standard
of
this
planet
by
about
two
hundred
percent
rakkeed
is
a
zirk
von
schlichten
said
they
the
nomads
who
hire
out
to
the
northern
merchants
as
and
also
prey
or
used
to
prey
on
the
caravans
as
brigands
since
our
got
into
operation
neither
nor
has
been
a
paying
business
and
our
have
made
suicidal
as
well
so
the
zirks
do
like
us
the
only
thing
they
know
or
are
willing
to
learn
is
handling
these
we
call
hipposaurs
we
employ
a
few
of
them
as
cavalry
and
a
few
more
of
them
work
as
the
local
equivalent
of
and
the
rest
just
sit
around
and
listen
to
rakkeed
sermons
both
jugs
were
empty

as
befitted

up
after
a
wrangle
with
von

handed
the
colonel
his
the
merchants
in
the
north
do
like
us
beside
spoiling
the
we
spoiling
their
local
business
because
the
barons
who
used
to
deal
with
them
are
now
dealing
directly
with
us
at
skilk
king
firkked
afraid
his
feudal
nobility
is
going
to
try
to
force
a
runnymede
on
him
so
he
been
currying
favor
with
the
urban
merchants
that
makes
him
as
and
as
as
they
are
at
krink
king
jonkvank
has
the
support
of
his
barons
but
he
afraid
of
his
urban
bourgeoisie
and
we
pay
him
a
handsome
subsidy
so
he
and
at
skilk
rakkeed
comes
and
goes
openly
at
krink
he
has
a
price
on
his
head
jonkvank
is
not
one
of
the
assets
we
boast
about
too
loudly
hideyoshi
said
pausing
on
his
way
from
the
table
he
as
an
old
murderer
as
you
care
not
to
meet
in
a
dark
alley
anywhere
we
can
turn
our
backs
on
him
and
not
expect
a
knife
between
our
shoulders
anyhow
von
schlichten
said
and
we
can
believe
oh
up
to
eighty
percent
of
what
he
tells
us
and
that
sixty
percent
better
than
any
of
the
other
native
princes
except
king
kankad
of
course
the
kragans
are
the
only
real
friends
we
have
on
this
planet
he
thought
for
a
moment
miss
quinton
are
you
doing
sociographic
here
in
addition
to
your
work
he
asked
well
let
me
advise
you
to
pay
some
attention
to
the
kragans
only
find
them
treated
at
any
length
at
all
in
that
compendium
of
misinformation
willard
sociographic
history
of
beta
hydrae
and
ninety
percent
of
what
says
about
them
is
completely
erroneous
oh
but
they
just
a
on
the
terrans
paula
quinton
objected
you
find
races
like
that
all
through
the
explored
galaxy
pathetic
cultural
mongrels
both
men
laughed
heartily
colonel
returning
with
the
jugs
wanted
to
know
what
he
missed
blount
told
him
ha
she
been
reading
that
thing
of
he
said
what
the
matter
with
paula
demanded
is
one
author
you
can
depend
on
assured
her
if
you
read
it
in
it
wrong
you
know
i
do
think
she
run
into
many
kragans
we
ought
to
take
her
over
and
introduce
her
to
king
kankad
von
schlichten
allowed
himself
to
be
smitten
by
an
idea
by
allah
so
we
had
he
exclaimed
look
you
going
to
skilk
in
the
next
week
are
you
well
do
you
think
you
could
get
all
your
cleared
up
here
and
be
ready
to
leave
by
tuesday
that
four
days
from
today
i
sure
i
could
why
well
i
going
to
skilk
myself
with
the
armed
troopship
we
stopping
at
king
kankad
town
to
pick
up
a
battalion
of
kragan
rifles
for
duty
at
the
polar
mines
where
going
suppose
we
leave
here
in
my
go
to
kankad
town
and
wait
there
till
the
gets
in
that
would
give
us
about
two
to
three
hours
if
you
think
the
kragans
are
cultural
mongrels
what
you
see
there
will
open
your
eyes
and
i
might
add
that
the
nearest
ever
came
to
seeing
kankad
town
was
from
the
air
once
at
a
distance
of
four
miles
well
they
live
entirely
by
serving
as
mercenary
soldiers
for
the
uller
company
do
they
more
or
less
you
see
when
we
came
to
uller
they
were
barbarian
brigands
had
a
string
of
forts
along
and
at
fords
and
and
levied
tolls
they
raided
into
konkrook
and
keegark
territory
too
well
we
had
to
break
that
up
we
fought
a
little
war
with
them
beat
them
rather
badly
in
a
couple
of
skirmishes
and
then
made
a
deal
with
them
that
was
before
my
time
when
old
jerry
kirke
was
he
negotiated
a
treaty
with
their
king
bought
their
outright
and
paid
them
a
subsidy
to
compensate
for
loss
of
tolls
and
and
agreed
to
employ
the
whole
tribe
as
soldiers
we
taught
them
a
lot
see
how
much
when
you
visit
their
town
but
they
are
cultural
mongrels
you
like
them
well
general
i
take
you
up
she
said
but
i
warn
you
if
this
is
some
scheme
to
indoctrinate
me
with
the
uller
company
side
of
the
case
and
blind
me
to
unjust
exploitation
of
the
natives
here
i
propagandize
very
easily
fair
enough
as
long
as
you
do
let
fear
of
being
propagandized
blind
you
to
the
good
we
doing
here
or
impair
your
ability
to
observe
and
draw
accurate
conclusions
just
stay
scientific
about
it
and
i
be
satisfied
now
let
take
time
out
for
lubrication
he
said
filling
her
glass
and
passing
the
jug
two
hours
and
five
cocktails
later
they
were
still
at
the
table
and
they
had
taught
paula
quinton
some
twenty
verses
of
heathen
geeks
they
wear
no
including
the
four
printable
ones
you
can
depend
on
it
it
wrong
gongonk
island
with
its
company
buildings
and
the
terran
green
of
the
farms
and
the
spaceport
with
its
ring
of
empty
since
the
of
had
lifted
out
two
days
before
for
terra
was
dropping
away
behind
von
schlichten
held
his
lighter
for
paula
quinton
then
lit
his
own
cigarette
i
was
rather
horrified
friday
afternoon
at
the
way
you
and
colonel
and
blount
were
blaspheming
against
she
said
his
book
is
practically
the
sociographers
koran
for
this
planet
but
i
been
checking
up
since
and
i
find
that
everybody
who
been
here
any
length
of
time
seems
to
deride
it
and
it
full
of
the
most
surprising
misstatements
i
either
going
to
make
myself
famous
or
get
burned
at
the
stake
by
the
extraterrestrial
sociographic
society
after
i
get
back
to
terra
in
the
last
three
months
i
been
really
too
busy
with
work
to
do
much
research
but
beginning
to
think
there
a
great
deal
in
book
that
will
have
to
be
reconsidered
how
you
get
into
this
miss
quinton
he
asked
you
mean
sociography
or
well
my
father
and
my
grandfather
were
both
extraterrestrial
sociographers
anthropologists
whose
subjects
are
anthropomorphic
and
i
majored
in
sociography
at
the
university
of
montevideo
and
i
always
been
in
sympathy
with
extraterrestrial
races
one
of
my
was
a
freyan
the
deuce
i
never
have
guessed
that
as
small
and
dark
as
you
are
well
another
of
my
was
japanese
she
replied
the
family
name
french
i
also
part
spanish
part
russian
part
italian
part
english
the
usual
modern
argentine
mixture
i
an
argentino
too
from
la
rioja
over
along
the
sierra
de
velasco
my
family
lived
there
for
the
past
five
centuries
they
came
to
the
argentine
in
the
year
three
atomic
era
on
account
of
the
hitler
yes
i
believe
the
first
one
also
a
general
von
schlichten
was
what
was
then
known
as
a
that
makes
us
partners
in
crime
then
she
laughed
the
quintons
had
to
leave
france
about
the
same
time
they
were
what
was
known
as
collaborationists
that
probably
why
the
southern
hemisphere
managed
to
stay
out
of
the
third
and
fourth
world
wars
he
considered
it
was
full
of
the
descendants
of
people
who
gotten
the
short
end
of
the
second
do
you
speak
the
kragan
language
general
she
asked
i
understand
it
entirely
different
from
the
other
equatorial
ulleran
languages
yes
that
what
gives
the
kragans
an
entirely
different
semantic
orientation
for
instance
they
have
nothing
like
a
sentence
structure
that
why
to
the
contrary
notwithstanding
they
are
entirely
their
language
has
instilled
in
them
a
predisposition
to
think
of
everything
as
the
result
of
an
action
performed
by
an
agent
and
they
have
no
definite
parts
of
speech
any
word
can
be
used
as
any
part
of
speech
depending
on
context
tense
is
applied
to
words
used
as
nouns
not
words
used
as
verbs
there
are
four
tenses
present
things
spatial
present
and
temporal
remote
things
which
were
here
at
some
other
time
spatial
remote
and
temporal
present
things
existing
now
somewhere
else
and
remote
things
somewhere
else
some
other
time
why
it
a
wonder
they
have
developed
a
theory
of
relativity
they
have
it
resembles
ours
about
the
way
the
wright
airplane
resembles
this
aircar
but
i
was
explaining
the
theory
and
the
older
einstein
theory
to
king
kankad
once
and
it
was
beautiful
to
watch
how
he
picked
it
up
half
the
time
he
was
a
jump
ahead
of
me
the
aircar
began
losing
altitude
and
speed
as
they
came
in
over
kraggork
swamp
the
treetops
below
blended
into
a
level
plain
of
pierced
by
glints
of
stagnant
water
underneath
and
broken
by
an
occasional
low
hillock
sometimes
topped
by
a
stockaded
village
those
are
the
homes
he
told
her
most
of
what
you
find
in
about
them
is
fairly
accurate
he
spent
a
lot
of
time
among
them
he
never
seems
to
have
realized
though
that
they
are
living
now
as
they
have
ever
since
the
first
appearance
of
intelligent
life
on
this
planet
you
mean
they
the
real
aboriginal
people
of
uller
they
and
the
jeel
cannibals
whom
we
are
doing
our
best
to
exterminate
he
replied
you
see
at
one
time
the
dominant
type
of
mobile
was
the
thing
we
call
a
shellosaur
a
big
thing
running
from
five
to
fifteen
tons
plated
all
over
with
silicate
shell
till
it
looked
like
a
some
were
herbivores
and
some
were
carnivores
there
are
a
few
left
in
remote
places
quite
a
few
in
the
southern
hemisphere
which
we
explored
very
much
they
were
a
satisfied
outside
of
a
volcano
or
an
earthquake
or
an
avalanche
nothing
could
hurt
a
shellosaur
but
a
bigger
shellosaur
finally
of
course
they
grew
beyond
their
but
in
the
meantime
some
of
them
began
specializing
on
mobility
instead
of
armor
and
began
excreting
instead
of
turning
it
to
shell
some
of
these
new
species
got
rid
of
their
shell
entirely
sapiens
is
descended
from
one
of
these
the
shellosaurs
were
still
a
serious
menace
though
the
ancestors
of
the
present
ulleran
the
when
they
were
at
about
the
java
stage
of
development
took
two
divergent
courses
to
escape
the
shellosaurs
some
of
them
took
to
the
swamps
where
the
shellosaurs
would
sink
if
they
tried
to
follow
those
savages
down
there
are
still
living
in
the
same
manner
they
never
progressed
others
encountered
problems
of
survival
which
had
to
be
overcome
by
invention
they
progressed
to
barbarism
like
the
people
of
the
and
some
of
them
progressed
to
civilization
like
the
konkrookans
and
the
keegarkans
then
there
were
others
who
took
to
the
high
rocks
where
the
shellosaurs
could
climb
the
jeels
are
the
primitive
original
example
of
that
most
of
the
north
uller
civilizations
developed
from
and
so
did
the
zirks
and
the
other
northern
plains
nomads
well
how
about
the
kragans
paula
asked
which
were
they
von
schlichten
was
scanning
the
horizon
ahead
he
pulled
over
a
pair
of
binoculars
on
a
swinging
arm
and
put
them
where
she
could
use
them
right
ahead
there
just
a
little
to
the
left
see
that
spot
on
the
landward
edge
of
the
swamp
that
king
kankad
town
it
been
there
for
thousands
of
years
and
it
always
been
town
you
might
say
even
the
same
kankad
the
kragan
kings
have
always
provided
their
own
heirs
by
that
a
complicated
process
involving
simultaneous
male
and
female
masturbation
but
the
offspring
is
an
exact
duplicate
of
the
single
parent
the
present
kankad
speaks
of
his
heir
as
me
which
is
a
fairly
accurate
way
of
putting
it
he
knew
what
she
was
seeing
through
the
glasses
a
massive
butte
of
flint
jutting
out
into
the
swamp
on
the
end
of
a
sharp
ridge
with
a
city
on
top
of
it
all
the
buildings
were
some
piling
upward
from
the
top
and
some
clinging
to
the
sides
the
high
watchtower
at
the
front
now
carried
a
aimed
at
an
automatic
on
an
unmanned
orbiter
two
thousand
miles
they
either
who
moved
up
onto
that
rock
or
mountaineers
who
came
out
that
far
along
the
ridge
and
stopped
she
said
which
nobody
ever
tried
to
find
out
maybe
if
you
stay
on
uller
long
enough
you
can
that
ought
to
be
good
for
about
eight
to
ten
honorary
doctorates
and
maybe
a
hundred
sols
a
year
in
book
royalties
maybe
i
just
do
that
general
what
that
on
the
little
island
over
there
she
asked
shifting
the
glasses
a
clump
of
buildings
under
a
that
dynamite
island
the
kragans
have
an
there
they
make
nitroglycerine
like
all
the
thalassic
peoples
they
also
make
tnt
and
catastrophite
and
propellants
learned
that
from
us
of
course
they
also
manufacture
most
of
their
own
firearms
some
of
them
pretty
extreme
up
to
for
shoulder
rifles
do
ever
fire
one
it
break
every
bone
in
your
body
are
they
that
much
stronger
than
us
he
shook
his
head
just
denser
heavier
they
about
equal
to
us
in
they
ca
run
or
jump
as
well
as
we
can
we
often
come
out
here
for
games
with
the
kragans
where
the
geeks
ca
watch
us
and
that
reminds
me
you
right
about
that
being
a
term
of
derogation
because
i
do
believe
i
ever
knowingly
spoken
of
a
kragan
as
a
geek
and
in
fact
they
picked
up
the
word
from
us
and
apply
it
to
all
but
as
i
was
saying
our
baseball
team
has
to
give
theirs
a
handicap
but
their
football
team
can
beat
the
daylights
out
of
ours
in
a
we
have
to
put
two
men
on
our
end
for
every
one
of
theirs
but
they
do
even
try
to
play
tennis
with
us
do
the
other
natives
make
their
own
firearms
no
and
we
not
going
to
teach
them
how
the
thalassic
peoples
here
in
the
equatorial
zone
are
fairly
good
empirical
chemists
well
no
alchemists
they
found
out
how
to
make
nitroglycerine
and
use
it
for
blasting
and
for
bombs
and
mines
and
they
screw
little
capsules
of
it
on
the
ends
of
their
arrows
most
of
their
chemistry
such
as
it
is
was
learned
in
trying
to
prevent
organic
materials
like
wood
from
petrifying
up
in
the
north
where
it
gets
cold
they
learned
a
lot
about
metallurgy
and
ceramics
and
about
pneumatics
from
having
to
keep
fires
going
all
winter
to
thaw
frozen
food
they
make
to
shoot
metal
darts
the
aircar
came
in
circling
slowly
over
the
town
on
the
big
rock
and
let
down
on
the
roof
of
the
building
from
which
the
watchtower
rose
there
were
a
dozen
or
so
individuals
waiting
for
them
the
five
terrans
three
men
and
two
women
from
the
telecast
station
and
the
rest
kragans
one
of
these
but
with
speckles
no
darker
than
light
amber
armed
only
with
a
heavy
dagger
came
over
and
clapped
von
schlichten
on
the
shoulder
grinning
opalescently
greetings
von
he
squawked
in
kragan
then
seeing
paula
switched
over
to
the
customary
language
of
the
takkad
sea
country
it
makes
happiness
to
see
you
how
long
will
you
stay
with
us
till
the
gets
in
from
konkrook
to
pick
up
the
rifles
von
schlichten
replied
in
lingua
terra
he
looked
at
his
watch
two
hours
and
a
half
kankad
this
is
paula
quinton
paula
king
kankad
he
took
out
his
and
crammed
it
into
his
mouth
before
any
other
race
on
uller
that
would
have
been
the
most
shocking
sort
of
bad
manners
without
the
of
the
handkerchief
kankad
took
it
as
a
matter
of
course
at
some
length
von
schlichten
explained
the
nature
of
paula
sociographic
work
her
connection
with
the
extraterrestrials
rights
association
and
her
intention
of
going
to
the
arctic
mines
kankad
nodded
you
were
right
he
said
i
would
have
understood
all
that
in
your
language
if
i
had
read
it
maybe
but
not
if
i
heard
it
he
put
his
upper
right
hand
on
paula
shoulder
and
uttered
a
clicking
approximation
of
her
name
i
make
you
one
of
us
he
told
her
you
must
come
back
after
the
work
stops
at
the
mines
if
you
want
to
learn
about
my
people
i
show
you
what
you
want
to
see
and
tell
you
what
you
want
to
know
but
why
not
stay
here
why
bother
about
those
geeks
at
the
mines
the
company
treats
them
much
better
than
they
deserve
stay
here
with
us
we
will
make
you
happy
to
be
with
us
paula
replied
slowly
i
thank
kankad
but
i
must
go
those
on
terra
who
sent
me
here
want
me
to
learn
for
myself
how
the
workers
at
the
mines
are
treated
but
i
will
come
back
in
a
hundred
a
hundred
and
fifty
days
kankad
grin
widened
good
we
be
waiting
for
you
he
turned
and
introduced
another
kragan
about
his
own
age
who
wore
the
equipment
and
insignia
of
a
company
and
was
freshly
painted
with
the
company
emblem
this
is
kormork
he
and
i
have
borne
young
to
each
other
kormork
you
watch
over
paula
quinton
he
managed
on
the
second
try
to
make
it
more
or
less
recognizable
bring
her
back
safe
or
else
find
yourself
a
good
place
to
hide
kankad
introduced
the
rest
of
his
people
and
von
schlichten
introduced
the
terrans
from
the
then
kankad
looked
at
the
watch
he
was
wearing
on
his
lower
left
wrist
we
will
have
plenty
of
time
before
the
ship
comes
to
show
paula
the
town
he
suggested
von
you
know
better
than
i
do
what
she
would
like
to
see
he
led
the
way
past
a
pair
of
long
guns
to
a
stone
stairway
von
schlichten
explained
as
they
went
down
that
the
guns
of
king
kankad
town
were
the
only
artillery
above
on
uller
in
hands
they
climbed
into
an
open
carrier
and
strapped
themselves
to
their
seats
and
for
two
hours
king
kankad
showed
her
the
sights
of
the
town
they
visited
the
school
where
young
kragans
were
being
taught
to
read
lingua
terra
and
studied
from
textbooks
printed
in
johannesburg
and
sydney
and
buenos
aires
kankad
showed
her
the
where
descendants
of
kragan
were
working
on
contragravity
equipment
under
the
supervision
of
a
and
his
wife
the
factory
where
very
respectable
copies
of
terran
rifles
and
pistols
and
were
being
turned
out
the
the
physics
and
chemistry
labs
the
hospital
the
plant
the
battery
of
long
toms
built
in
kankad
own
shops
which
covered
the
road
up
the
sloping
behind
the
city
the
and
the
observatory
with
a
big
telescope
and
an
ingenious
orrery
of
the
beta
hydrae
system
the
plant
part
of
the
original
price
for
giving
up
brigandage
half
an
hour
before
the
ship
from
konkrook
was
due
they
had
arrived
at
the
airport
where
a
gang
of
kragans
were
clearing
a
berth
for
the
from
somewhere
kankad
produced
two
cold
bottles
of
cape
town
beer
for
paula
and
von
schlichten
and
a
bowl
of
some
black
liquid
for
himself
von
schlichten
and
paula
lit
cigarettes
between
sips
of
his
bubbling
kankad
gnawed
on
the
stalk
of
some
paula
seemed
as
much
surprised
at
kankad
disregard
for
the
eating
taboo
as
she
had
been
at
von
schlichten
open
flouting
of
the
convention
of
concealment
when
he
had
put
in
his
this
is
the
only
place
on
uller
where
this
happens
von
schlichten
told
her
here
or
in
the
field
when
terran
and
kragan
soldiers
are
together
there
are
any
taboos
between
us
and
the
kragans
no
kankad
said
we
can
not
eat
each
others
food
and
because
our
bodies
are
different
we
can
not
be
the
fathers
of
each
others
young
but
we
have
been
and
worksharers
and
we
have
learned
from
each
other
my
people
more
from
yours
than
yours
from
mine
before
you
came
my
people
were
like
children
shooting
arrows
at
little
animals
on
the
beach
and
climbing
among
the
rocks
at
and
playing
war
with
toy
weapons
but
we
are
growing
up
and
it
will
not
be
long
before
we
will
stand
beside
you
as
the
grown
son
stands
beside
his
parent
and
when
that
day
comes
you
will
not
be
ashamed
of
us
it
was
easy
to
forget
that
kankad
had
four
arms
and
a
rubbery
skin
and
a
face
like
a
lizard
i
have
always
wished
that
some
of
your
people
could
come
to
terra
to
study
von
schlichten
said
i
was
talking
about
it
with
sid
harrington
only
a
short
while
ago
he
thinks
it
would
be
a
good
thing
for
your
people
and
for
mine
yes
i
want
little
me
when
he
old
enough
to
travel
to
visit
your
world
kankad
said
and
some
of
the
other
young
ones
and
when
little
me
is
old
enough
to
take
over
the
rule
of
our
people
i
would
like
to
go
to
terra
myself
some
day
i
am
going
to
return
to
terra
i
would
like
to
have
you
make
the
trip
with
me
von
schlichten
said
that
would
be
wonderful
von
kankad
exclaimed
i
want
to
see
your
world
before
i
die
it
must
be
a
wonderful
place
a
world
is
what
its
people
make
it
and
your
people
must
be
able
to
make
anything
of
your
world
that
you
would
want
we
almost
made
a
lifeless
desert
like
the
poles
of
uller
out
of
our
world
once
von
schlichten
told
him
four
hundred
and
more
years
ago
we
fought
great
wars
among
ourselves
with
weapons
such
as
i
hope
will
never
even
be
thought
of
on
uller
our
whole
northern
hemisphere
where
our
greatest
nations
were
was
devastated
much
of
it
is
wasteland
to
this
day
but
we
put
an
end
to
that
folly
in
time
we
made
one
nation
out
of
all
our
people
and
swore
never
to
commit
such
crimes
again
and
then
we
built
the
ships
that
took
us
out
to
the
stars
but
i
want
you
to
see
our
world
and
some
of
the
other
worlds
that
we
have
visited
i
think
you
would
like
it
i
know
i
would
and
with
you
to
tell
me
what
the
things
i
would
see
meant
kankad
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
spoke
again
changing
the
subject
abruptly
i
hope
paula
will
pardon
me
but
is
paula
the
kind
of
terran
that
bears
young
that
right
kankad
i
never
bore
any
yet
but
that
the
kind
of
terran
i
am
i
like
paula
kankad
said
she
has
come
all
the
way
from
terra
to
help
us
and
to
learn
about
us
of
course
the
kragans
do
need
that
kind
of
help
and
the
geeks
who
would
stick
a
knife
in
her
as
soon
as
she
turned
her
back
on
them
do
deserve
it
but
she
wants
to
learn
about
us
just
as
i
want
to
learn
about
terra
von
why
do
you
and
paula
have
young
he
asked
i
think
that
would
be
fine
then
little
and
little
me
could
be
friends
long
after
the
three
of
us
are
dead
and
gone
vi
the
bad
news
came
after
the
coffee
the
last
clatter
of
silverware
and
dishes
ceased
as
the
native
servants
finished
clearing
the
table
there
was
a
remaining
clatter
of
cups
and
saucers
tinkled
and
an
occasional
clicked
at
the
head
table
the
voices
seemed
louder
do
like
it
a
millisol
worth
barney
mordkovitz
the
skilk
military
co
was
saying
to
the
lady
on
his
right
they
too
confounded
meek
nowadays
nobody
yells
suddabit
at
you
nobody
sticks
all
four
thumbs
in
his
mouth
and
waves
his
fingers
nobody
commits
nuisance
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
you
they
just
stand
and
look
at
you
like
a
farmer
looking
at
a
turkey
the
week
before
christmas
and
that
i
do
like
oh
bosh
jules
keaveney
the
skilk
at
the
head
of
the
table
exclaimed
you
soldiers
are
all
alike
begging
your
pardon
general
von
schlichten
he
nodded
in
the
direction
of
the
guest
of
honor
if
they
do
bow
and
scrape
to
you
and
get
off
the
sidewalk
to
let
you
pass
you
say
they
insolent
and
need
a
lesson
if
they
do
you
say
they
plotting
insurrection
what
i
said
mordkovitz
repeated
was
that
i
expect
a
certain
amount
of
disorder
and
a
certain
minimum
show
of
hostility
toward
us
from
some
of
these
geeks
to
conform
to
what
i
know
to
be
our
unpopularity
with
many
of
them
when
i
do
find
it
i
want
to
know
why
i
inclined
von
schlichten
came
to
his
subordinate
support
to
agree
this
sudden
absence
of
overt
hostility
is
disquieting
colonel
he
called
on
the
local
intelligence
officer
and
constabulary
chief
this
fellow
rakkeed
was
here
about
a
month
ago
was
there
any
noticeable
disorder
at
that
time
demonstrations
attacks
on
company
property
or
personnel
shooting
at
aircars
that
sort
of
thing
no
more
than
usual
general
in
fact
it
was
when
rakkeed
came
here
that
the
condition
general
mordkovitz
was
speaking
of
began
to
become
conspicuous
we
did
catch
some
of
rakkeed
disciples
trying
to
get
in
among
the
enlisted
men
of
the
tenth
and
the
fifth
zirk
cavalry
and
promote
disaffection
that
was
reported
at
the
time
sir
and
acted
upon
as
far
as
the
civil
administration
would
permit
von
schlichten
replied
and
i
might
say
that
blount
has
reported
from
keegark
where
he
is
now
that
the
same
unnatural
absence
of
hostility
exists
there
well
of
course
general
keaveney
said
patronizingly
king
orgzild
has
things
under
pretty
tight
control
at
keegark
he
not
allow
a
few
fanatics
to
do
anything
to
prejudice
these
spaceport
negotiations
i
wonder
if
the
idea
back
of
that
spaceport
proposition
is
to
get
us
concentrated
at
keegark
where
orgzild
could
wipe
us
all
out
in
one
surprise
blow
somebody
down
the
table
suggested
oh
orgzild
would
be
crazy
enough
to
try
anything
like
that
commander
dirk
prinsloo
of
the
declared
he
get
away
with
it
for
just
twelve
months
the
time
it
would
take
to
get
the
news
to
terra
and
for
a
federation
space
navy
to
get
here
and
then
there
be
little
bits
of
radioactive
geek
floating
around
this
system
as
far
out
as
the
orbit
of
beta
hydrae
vii
that
quite
true
von
schlichten
agreed
the
point
is
does
orgzild
know
it
i
doubt
if
he
even
believes
there
is
a
terra
then
where
in
space
does
he
think
we
come
from
keaveney
demanded
i
believe
he
thinks
niflheim
is
our
home
world
von
schlichten
replied
or
rather
the
string
of
orbiters
and
artificial
satellites
around
niflheim
where
he
thinks
niflheim
is
i
would
even
try
to
guess
well
it
takes
six
months
for
a
ship
to
go
between
here
and
nif
prinsloo
considered
because
of
the
hyperdrive
effects
the
experienced
time
of
the
voyage
inside
the
ship
is
of
the
order
of
three
weeks
taking
that
as
the
figure
he
estimate
the
distance
at
about
a
miles
assuming
the
velocity
as
being
the
speed
of
one
of
our
here
on
uller
i
assuming
he
does
even
know
there
is
a
hyperdrive
yes
after
he
wiped
us
out
he
might
even
consider
the
idea
of
an
invasion
of
niflheim
with
captured
contragravity
ships
hideyoshi
chuckled
that
would
be
a
big
laugh
if
any
of
us
were
alive
then
to
do
any
laughing
you
do
really
believe
that
general
keaveney
asked
his
tone
was
still
derisive
but
under
the
derision
was
uncertainty
after
all
von
schlichten
had
been
on
uller
for
fifteen
years
to
his
two
any
question
of
geek
psychology
is
wide
open
as
far
as
i
concerned
the
longer
i
stay
here
the
less
i
understand
it
von
schlichten
finished
his
brandy
and
got
out
and
lighter
i
have
an
idea
of
the
sort
of
garbled
reports
these
spies
of
his
who
spend
a
year
on
niflheim
as
laborers
bring
back
you
know
the
line
rakkeed
been
taking
of
course
colonel
put
in
he
as
much
as
says
that
niflheim
our
home
and
that
the
farms
where
we
raise
food
here
and
those
evergreen
plantings
on
konk
isthmus
and
between
here
and
grank
are
the
beginning
of
an
attempt
to
drive
all
native
life
from
this
planet
and
make
it
over
for
ourselves
and
that
savage
did
think
an
idea
like
that
up
for
himself
he
got
it
from
somebody
like
orgzild
the
added
you
know
the
main
base
off
niflheim
is
practically
with
and
culture
vats
and
it
enough
bigger
than
one
of
the
ships
to
pass
for
a
little
world
yes
somebody
like
orgzild
or
king
firkked
here
could
easily
pick
up
the
idea
that
that
our
home
planet
but
king
kankad
was
talking
about
paula
quinton
began
we
were
speaking
of
geeks
not
kragans
von
schlichten
lit
his
cigarette
and
held
his
lighter
for
hers
you
saw
that
big
beta
hydrae
orrery
at
kankad
observatory
well
there
quite
a
little
story
about
that
you
know
it
generally
realized
by
the
natives
here
that
uller
is
a
globe
the
north
zirks
have
ridden
all
the
way
around
it
on
in
the
high
latitudes
and
the
thalassic
peoples
at
the
equator
have
sailed
all
the
five
equatorial
seas
and
portaged
all
the
isthmuses
between
but
of
course
uller
is
the
center
of
the
universe
the
sun
travels
around
it
on
a
rather
complicated
track
as
a
theory
it
explains
most
of
what
able
to
observe
and
any
minor
effects
that
do
conform
to
it
are
just
ignored
they
have
a
model
a
most
ingenious
affair
run
by
clockwork
at
the
university
of
konkrook
to
show
the
apparent
movement
and
position
of
beta
hydrae
in
the
sky
it
does
so
fairly
accurately
well
some
of
our
astronomers
constructed
this
orrery
and
exhibited
it
to
a
gathering
of
the
leading
native
scholars
who
are
also
the
of
the
local
religion
sort
of
combined
academy
of
arts
and
sciences
and
college
of
cardinals
they
almost
were
massacred
as
soon
as
the
assembled
pundits
saw
this
thing
and
grasped
its
meaning
they
began
geeking
and
skreeking
and
yorking
and
squawking
and
brandishing
knives
it
was
blasphemous
and
sacrilegious
and
undermined
the
faith
and
invalidated
the
whole
i
was
in
command
of
konkrook
military
district
then
the
post
them
has
now
when
i
got
a
from
the
university
i
hustled
around
with
a
company
of
kragans
and
we
cleared
the
hall
with
the
bayonet
and
ran
the
reverend
professors
out
onto
the
campus
and
after
we
got
things
in
hand
the
kragans
crowded
around
the
orrery
trying
to
set
it
up
to
show
the
existing
position
of
the
planet
relative
to
the
primary
and
figure
out
the
theory
back
of
it
they
were
very
much
interested
some
of
them
must
have
sent
word
home
about
it
because
kankad
came
in
on
the
next
ship
wanting
to
see
it
he
was
so
much
taken
with
it
that
sid
harrington
gave
it
to
him
one
of
his
most
cherished
possessions
but
the
konkrook
pundits
bite
all
four
thumbs
and
wave
their
fingers
every
time
they
think
of
it
he
warmed
his
coffee
from
a
pot
you
ca
use
kragan
thinking
on
any
subject
as
a
criterion
of
what
somebody
like
orgzild
opinions
will
be
i
never
could
understand
the
admiration
some
of
you
military
people
have
for
those
cutthroats
keaveney
declared
oh
yes
i
can
you
like
them
because
they
do
your
dirty
work
for
you
he
reads
too
i
bet
hideyoshi
said
miss
quinton
how
did
you
like
your
visit
to
kankad
town
still
think
the
kragans
are
cultural
mongrels
why
they
wonderful
i
never
expected
anything
like
it
they
just
seem
to
have
picked
up
everything
they
could
from
us
and
then
gone
on
from
there
to
develop
a
culture
of
their
own
with
our
techniques
for
instance
those
big
guns
the
ones
they
call
the
ridge
battery
that
they
built
for
themselves
they
are
copies
of
terran
guns
they
do
look
like
our
work
or
give
you
the
feel
our
work
would
and
that
telescope
at
the
observatory
she
continued
did
they
build
that
too
yes
all
we
furnished
was
a
couple
of
textbooks
on
and
and
a
book
on
optics
you
see
when
we
made
that
deal
with
them
they
realized
that
we
were
any
better
fighters
than
they
were
we
just
had
better
weapons
to
have
the
same
kind
of
weapons
they
have
to
learn
to
make
them
and
once
they
began
studying
technology
they
found
that
they
had
to
study
science
was
the
after
that
they
found
that
they
could
use
the
same
skills
to
make
anything
else
they
wanted
give
them
another
century
or
so
and
they
be
one
of
the
great
races
of
the
galaxy
yes
and
it
a
good
thing
they
our
friends
too
mordkovitz
added
i
only
sorry
there
are
so
few
of
them
and
so
many
of
the
geeks
yes
the
company
ought
to
let
us
stockpile
nuclear
weapons
here
just
to
be
on
the
safe
side
another
officer
farther
down
the
table
said
well
i
not
exactly
in
favor
of
that
von
schlichten
replied
it
the
same
principle
as
not
allowing
guards
who
have
to
go
in
among
the
convicts
to
carry
firearms
if
somebody
like
orgzild
got
hold
of
a
nuclear
bomb
even
a
little
old
he
could
use
it
for
a
model
and
construct
a
hundred
like
it
with
all
the
plutonium
we
been
handing
out
for
power
reactors
and
there
are
too
few
of
us
and
we
concentrated
in
too
few
places
to
last
long
if
that
happened
what
this
planet
needs
though
is
a
visit
by
a
of
the
space
navy
just
to
show
the
geeks
what
we
have
back
of
us
after
a
show
like
that
there
be
a
lot
less
around
here
general
i
deplore
that
sort
of
talk
keaveney
said
i
hear
too
much
of
this
stuff
from
some
of
the
junior
officers
here
without
your
giving
countenance
and
encouragement
to
it
we
here
to
earn
dividends
for
the
stockholders
of
the
uller
company
and
we
can
only
do
that
by
gaining
the
friendship
respect
and
confidence
of
the
natives
keaveney
paula
quinton
spoke
up
i
doubt
if
even
you
would
seriously
accuse
the
extraterrestrials
rights
association
of
favoring
what
you
call
a
policy
we
done
everything
in
our
power
to
help
these
people
and
if
anybody
should
have
their
friendship
we
should
well
only
five
days
ago
in
konkrook
mohammed
ferriera
and
i
were
attacked
by
a
mob
our
native
aircar
driver
was
murdered
and
if
it
had
been
for
general
von
schlichten
and
his
soldiers
we
have
lost
our
own
lives
ferriera
is
still
hospitalized
as
a
result
of
injuries
he
received
it
seems
that
general
von
schlichten
and
his
kragans
are
trying
to
get
friendship
and
confidence
they
willing
to
settle
for
respect
in
the
only
way
they
can
get
it
by
hitting
harder
and
quicker
than
the
geeks
can
somebody
down
the
table
one
of
the
military
of
course
said
hear
hear
von
schlichten
came
as
close
as
a
man
wearing
a
monocle
can
to
winking
at
paula
good
girl
he
thought
she
started
playing
on
the
army
team
well
of
course
keaveney
began
then
he
stopped
as
a
terran
sergeant
came
up
to
the
table
and
bent
over
barney
shoulder
whispering
urgently
the
brigadier
rose
immediately
taking
his
belt
from
the
back
of
his
chair
and
putting
it
on
motioning
the
sergeant
to
accompany
him
he
spoke
briefly
to
keaveney
and
then
came
around
the
table
to
where
von
schlichten
sat
the
accompanying
him
message
just
came
in
from
konkrook
general
he
said
softly

harrington

took
von
schlichten
all
of
a
second
to
grasp
what
had
been
said
good
god
when
how
here

the
sergeant
said
giving

from
the
telecast
station
sergeant
he
asked
all
right

minute
general
keaveney
put
out
a
hand
to
detain
him
as
he
took
his
belt
and
put
it
on
how
about
this
he
gestured
nervously
with
the
radioprint
slip
get
up
and
make
an
announcement
now
von
schlichten
told
him

the
buckle
and
hitching

the
west

fading
from
crimson
to
and
a
couple
of
the
brighter
stars
were
winking
into
visibility
von
schlichten
and
the
sergeant
hurried
a
hundred
yards
down
the
street
between
low
office
buildings
to
the
telecast
station
next
to
the
administration
building
a
woman

early
he
was
going
hunting
in
the
morning
i
suppose
you
know
his
usual
routine
von
schlichten
nodded
harrington
would
have
taken
a
shower
put
on
his
and
then
sat
down
at
his
desk
lighted
his
pipe
poured
a
drink
of
terran
bourbon
and
begun
to
write
his
diary
well
at
give
or
take
a
couple
of
minutes
the
kragan
on
that
floor
heard
ten
as
fast
as
they
could
be
fired
in
the
governor
room
the
door
was
locked
but
he
shot
it
off
with
his
own
pistol
and
went
in
he
found
governor
harrington
on
the
floor
wearing
only
his
gown
holding
an
empty
pistol
he
was
in
convulsions
frothing
at
the
mouth
in
horrible
pain
evidently
he
fired
his
pistol
which
he
kept
on
his
desk
to
call
help
all
the
bullets
had
gone
into
the
ceiling
the
sergeant
punched
the
emergency
button
beside
the
bed
and
reported
then
tried
to
help
the
governor
but
it
was
too
late
one
of
the
medics
got
there
in
five
minutes
just
as
he
was
dying
he
written
his
diary
up
to
noon
of
today
and
broken
off
in
the
middle
of
a
word
there
was
a
bottle
and
an
overturned
glass
on
his
desk
the
constabulary
got
there
a
few
minutes
later
and
then
took
charge
a
white
rat
given
fifteen
drops
from

with
the
same
symptoms
in
about
ninety
seconds
who
had
access
to
the
a
geek
servant
who
takes
care
of
the
room
he
was
caught
an
hour
earlier
trying
to
slip
off
the
island
without
a
pass
they
were
holding
him
at
the
guardhouse
when
governor
harrington
died
he
now
being
questioned
by
the
kragans
the
girl
face
was
bleakly
remorseless

before
he
talks
wait
a
moment
general

the
girl
said
i
switch
you

into
a
kaleidoscopic
jumble
of
color
then
cleared
the
face
of
themistocles
was
looking
out
of
it
i
heard
what
happened
how
they
found
him
and
about
that
geek
being
arrested
von
schlichten
said
did
you
get
anything
out
of
him
he
admitted
putting

idea
but
he
one
of
father
keeluk
parishioners

those
rabbits
five
thousand
miles
away
in
konkrook
themistocles

minute
i
make
a
note
of
that
to

von
schlichten
watched
pick
up
a
stenophone
and
whisper
into
it
for
a
moment
all
right
carlos

keegark
but
he

audience
with
king
orgzild
and
we
ca
reach

well
who

at
konkrook
now
not
much
of
anybody
laviola
the
fiscal
secretary
and
hans
meyerstein
the
banking
cartel
lawyer
and
howlett
the
personnel
chief
and
buhrmann
the
commercial
secretary
have
made
up
a
sort
of
quadrumvirate
and
are
trying
to
run
things
i
do
know
what
would
happen
if
anything
came
up
suddenly
a
uniformed
arm
with
a
major
came
into
the
screen
handing
a
slip
of
paper
to
he
took
it
glanced
at
it
and
swore
von
schlichten
waited
until
he
had
read
it
through
well
something
has
all
right
the
african
said
we
just
got
a
call
from
jaikark
palace
a
revolt
broken
out
presumably
headed
by
gurgurk
household
guards
either
mutinied
or
wiped
out
by
the
mutineers
all
but
those
twenty
kragan
rifles
we
loaned
jaikark
they
and
about
a
dozen
of
jaikark
courtiers
and
their
personal
retainers
are
holding
the
approaches
to
the
king
apartments
the
in
charge
of
the
kragans
just
radioed
in
says
the
situation
is
desperate
when
a
kragan
says
that
he
means
damn
near
hopeless
is
this
being
recorded
when
nodded
he
continued
all
right
use
the
recording
for
your
authority
and
take
charge
i
declaring
martial
rule
at
konkrook
as
of
now
tell
eric
blount
what
happened
and
what
you
done
as
soon
as
you
can
get
in
touch
with
him
leaving
for
konkrook
at
once
i
ought
to
get
in
by
now
as
to
the
trouble
at
the
palace
do
commit
more
than
one
company
of
kragans
and
ten
airjeeps
and
four
and
tell
them
to
evacuate
jaikark
and
his
followers
and
our
kragans
to
gongonk
island
and
alert
your
whole
force
these
geek
palace
revolutions
are
always
synchronized
with
and
this
thing
seems
to
have
been
synchronized
with
sid
harrington
death
too
get
our
kragans
out
if
you
ca
save
anybody
else
from
the
palace
but
sacrificing
thirty
or
forty
men
to
save
twenty
is
no
kind
of
business
and
keep
sending
reports
i
can
pick
them
up
on
my
car
radio
as
i
come
down
he
turned
to
the
girl
sergeant
keep
on
this
there
be
more
coming
in
he
rose
and
left
the
booth
if
we
can
pull
jaikark
bacon
off
the
fire
he
was
thinking
the
company
can
dictate
its
own
terms
to
him
afterward
if
jaikark
killed
we
have
gurgurk
head
off
for
it
and
then
take
over
konkrook
in
either
case
it
be
a
long
step
toward
getting
rid
of
all
these
geek
despots
and
with
eric
blount
as
the
girl
captain
in
charge
of
the

as

the

swarming
up

into
the
of

there
was
shooting
which
told
him
that
some
of
the
humans
who
had
been
at
the

were
still
alive
he
wondered
how
many
and
whether
they
could
hold

he
could
clear

most
of
all
he
found
himself
thinking
of

to
a

within
fifty
yards
of
the

he
flung
out
his

shouting

then
give

poured

there
was
some

a

narrowly
missed
him
with

saw

the

would
have
stood
firm
even
under

they
should
not
have
broken
as
they
did
but
the
best
of
these
had
paid
for
their
loyalty
to
the
company
with
their
lives
and
the
rest
had
destroyed
their
authority
by
revolting
against
the
source
from
which
it
was
derived
at
that
the
skilkan
peasantry
who
made
up
the
tenth
infantry
and
the
zirk
cavalrymen
tried
briefly
to
fight
as
individuals
shrieking

until
the
kragans
were
upon

stabbing
and
shooting
they
drove
the
rioters
from

they
wiped

we
had
about
thirty
seconds

and
the
kragans
in

bought
us
another
sixty
seconds
of

we
all
had
our

hey
these

somebody
discovered

by

and

at

again
they
started
to

there
was
a

and
a

of

from
up

they
turned
and
fled

at

the

stood
on

poised
seeking
more
enemies
the
up
the

stuttered
a
few
short
bursts
and
were
silent
from
behind
the
beleaguered
terrans
and
their
kragan
guards
were
emerging
he
saw
jules
keaveney
and
his
wife
commander
prinsloo
of

ah
there
she
was
he
heaved
a
breath
of
relief
and
waved
to

the
kragans
were
already
setting
about
their
chores
about
twenty
of
them
spread
out
on

the

by

went
into
the
street
one
covering
with
his

while
the
other
three
checked
on
their
own
casualties
used
the
short
swords
they
carried
to
slash
off
the

of

and
collected

and

a
couple
of

more

led
by

came
up
at
the

and
stopped
in

we
were
in
quarters
aboard
the
and
in
the
guesthouse
at
the

kormork
reported
we
were
attacked
fifteen
minutes
ago
by
a

we
took
ten
minutes
beating
them
off
and
five
more
getting
here
i
sent
zeerjeek
and
the
rest
of
the
force
to
retake
the

the
shops
and

hangars
which
had
been
taken
and
relieve
the
military
airport
which
is
under
attack
there
was
still
firing
from
the
commercial
airport
and
the
smaller
military
airfield
once
there
was
a
string
of
heavy
explosions
that
sounded
like
rockets
good
enough
i
hope
you
did
spread
yourself
out
too
thin
the
situation
at
the
commercial
airport
the
two
ships
the
and
the
freighter
are
both
safe
kormork
replied
i
saw
them
go
on
contragravity
and
rise
to
about
a
hundred
feet
whose
crowd
is
that
you
have

asked
the
terran

who
had
taken
over

of
the

we
were
on

out
in

of

a
couple
of
runners
from
captain
retief
of

came
in
with
word
that
he
was
being
attacked
by
mutineers
from
the
tenth
but
that
he
was
holding
them
back
so
captain
charbonneau
who
was
killed
a
few
minutes
ago
left
a
terran
lieutenant
and
a
kragan
and
a
couple
of
and
thirty
kragans
to
hold
the
guardhouse
and
brought
the
rest
of
us
here
von

nodded
you
pass
the

and
the
would

he
asked
yes

the

holding
out
and
i
saw
the
on
the
fence
around
the
that
meant
the
was
for
the
time
safe
somebody
turned
twenty
thousand
volts
into
the
fence
all
right
i
setting
up
my
command
post
at
the
telecast
station
where
the
communication
equipment
is
he
turned
to
the
crowd
that
had
come
out
onto
the
porch
from
inside
where
colonel
here
general
the
intelligence
and
constabulary
officer
pushed
through
the

i
was
on

talking

and
all

i
afraid
pop

is
done
for
nobody

there
but
the
is
still
on
in
the
room
and
the
place
is
full
of
geeks
colonel
jarman
coming
here
with
a
lorry
to
get

he
leavitt
has
all
the

herded
into
a
repair
dock
keeping
them
covered
with
the
forward
gun
of
the
and

that
what
i
was
going
to
ask

at

the
south
of

you
take
all
your

and
half
these

here
and
help
clear

and
do
bother
taking
any
prisoners
we
ca
spare

kormork
grinned
the
taking
of
prisoners
had
always
been
one
of
those
irrational
terran
customs
which
no
ulleran
regarded
with
favor
or
even
comprehension
viii
authority
of
von
schlichten
there
was
fresh
intelligence
from
konkrook
by
the
time
he
returned
to
the
telecast
station
mutiny
had
broken
out
there
among
the
laborers
and
native
troops
who
outnumbered
the
terrans
and
their
kragan
mercenaries
on
gongonk
island
by
five
thousand
to
five
hundred
and
fifteen
hundred
respectively
the
attempt
to
relieve
jaikark
palace
had
been
called
off
before
the
could
be
sent
there
was
heavy
and
confused
fighting
all
over
the
island
and
most
of
the
combat
contragravity
and
about
half
the
kragan
rifles
had
had
to
be
committed
to
defend
the
company
farms
across
the
channel
on
the
mainland
south
of
the
city
there
had
also
been
an
urgent
call
for
help
from
colonel
rodolfo
mackinnon
in
command
of
company
troops
at
the
keegark
residency
and
another
from
the
residency
at
kwurk
one
of
the
free
cities
on
the
eastern
shore
of
takkad
sea
he
called
keegark
a
girl
apparently
one
of
the
civilian
telecast
technicians
answered
we
must
have
help
general
von
schlichten
she
told
him
the
native
troops
all
but
two
hundred
kragans
have
mutinied
they
have
everything
here
except
company
house
docks
airport
everything
we
trying
to
hold
out
but
there
are
thousands
of
them
our
takkad
native
infantry
soldiers
of
king
orgzild
army
and
townspeople
they
all
seem
to
have
firearms
what
happened
to
eric
blount
and
your
mr
lemoyne
we
do
know
they
were
at
the
palace
talking
to
king
orgzild
we
tried
to
call
the
palace
but
we
ca
get
through
general
we
must
have
help
a
call
came
in
a
few
minutes
later
from
krink
five
hundred
miles
to
the
northeast
across
the
mountains
the
there
one
francis
xavier
shapiro
reported
rioting
in
the
city
and
an
attempted
against
king
jonkvank
and
that
the
residency
was
under
attack
by
way
of
variety
it
was
the
army
of
king
jonkvank
that
had
mutinied
the
sixth
north
uller
native
infantry
and
the
two
companies
of
zirk
cavalry
at
krink
were
still
loyal
along
with
the
kragans
there
was
a
pattern
to
all
this
von
schlichten
stood
staring
at
the
big
map
on
the
wall
showing
the
takkad
sea
area
at
the
equatorial
zone
and
the
country
north
of
it
to
the
pole
the
area
of
uller
occupied
by
the
company
he
was
almost
beginning
to
discern
the
underlying
logic
of
the
past
events
when
keaveney
the
skilk
resident
blundered
into
him
in
a
sorry
general
did
see
you
his
face
was
ashen
and
his
jowls
sagged
von
schlichten
wondered
if
there
could
be
another
spectacle
so
as
a
extrovert
with
the
bottom
knocked
out
of
him
my
god
it
happening
all
over
uller
not
just
here
at
skilk
everywhere
where
we
have
a
residency
or
a
why
the
end
of
all
of
us
it
not
quite
that
bad
mr
keaveney
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
now
nearly
an
hour
since
the
native
troops
here
at
skilk
had
mutinied
insurrections
like
this
usually
succeeded
or
failed
in
the
first
hour
it
was
a
little
early
to
be
certain
but
he
was
beginning
to
suspect
that
this
one
had
succeeded
if
we
all
do
our
part
we
come
out
of
it
all
right
he
told
keaveney
more
cheerfully
than
he
felt
then
turned
to
ask
mordkovitz
how
the
fighting
was
going
at
the
barracks
not
badly
general
colonel
jarman
got
some
contragravity
up
and
working
they
blew
out
all
four
of
the
tenth
barracks
the
tenth
and
the
zirks
are
trying
to
defend
the
cavalry
barracks
some
of
our
kragans
managed
to
slip
around
behind
the
cavalry
stables
leading
out
hipposaurs
and
sniping
at
the
rear
of
the
cavalry
barracks
that
give
us
some
cavalry
of
our
own
a
lot
of
these
kragans
are
good
riders
how
about
the
and
and
i
do
want
these
geeks
getting
hold
of
that
equipment
and
using
it
against
us
kormork
outfit
are
trying
to
take
back
the
got
a
couple
of
airjeeps
and
a
helping
them
wo
be

of

left
by
this
time
tomorrow
keaveney
was
wailing
to
paula
quinton
and
another
woman
and
the
company
is
finished
we
better
get
him
a
drink
or
a
cup
of
coffee
general
mordkovitz
suggested
with
a
in
it
colonel
the
intelligence
officer
seemed
to
have
somewhat
the
same
idea
he
approached
keaveney
and
tried
to
quiet
him
at
the
same
time
a
woman
in
black
slacks
and
an
orange
sweater
the
one
whose
pursuers
had
been
overrun
by
the
kragans
at
the
beginning
of
the
fighting
approached
von

general
king
kankad
calling
she
said
he
on
the
screen
in

four
right
to
avoid
any
possibility
of
misunderstanding
he
slipped
his
into
his
mouth
before
entering
the
booth
kankad
face
was
looking
out
of
the
screen
at
him
with
phil
yamazaki
the
telecast
operator
at
kankad
town
standing
behind
him
von
the
kragan
spoke
almost
as
though
in
physical
pain
what
can
i
do
to
help
i
have
twenty
thousand
of
my
people
here
who
are
capable

bearing

but
i
have

for
only

hundred
where
shall
i
send

thought
quickly
keegark
was
finished
the
residency
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
city
surrounded
by
two
hundred
thousand
of
king
orgzild
troops
and
subjects
since
ullerans
were
bisexual
the
total
population
less
the
senile
crippled
and
very
young
was
the
military
potential
sending
kankad
five
hundred
warriors
and
his
meager
contragravity
there
would
be
the
same
as
shoveling
them
into
a
furnace
the
people
at
keegark
would
have
to
be
written
off
like
the
twenty
kragans
at
jaikark
palace
send
them
to

he
decided
them
in

there
he
need
help
to
hold

maybe
he
can
find
additional
transport
for
you

two
thousand
feet
i
implement
that
at
once
going
into
a
temporarily
idle
telecast
booth
he
called
konkrook
first
he
spoke
to
a
civilian
who
chewed
a
dead
cigar
and
then
he
got
themistocles
on
the
screen
how
is
it
now
he
asked
getting
a
little
better
the
replied
half
an
hour
ago
we
were
shooting
geeks
out
the
windows
here
now
we
have
them
contained
between
the
spaceport
and
the
and
labor
barracks
and
down
the
east
side
of
the
island
to
the
farms
we
have
the
wire
around
the
farms
on
the
island
electrified
and
we
using
almost
all
our
combat
contragravity
to
keep
the
farms
on
the
mainland
clear
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
did
you
hear
about
eric
and
lemoyne
von
schlichten
shook
his
head
we
just
got
a
call
from
rodolfo
mackinnon
he
took
a
couple
of
prisoners
and
made
them
talk
the
whole
party
that
were
at
palace
were
massacred
some
of
them
were
lucky
enough
to
get
killed
fighting
the
geeks
took
eric
and
hendrik
alive
rolled
them
in
a
puddle
of
thermoconcentrate
fuel
and
set
fire
to
them
when
we
can
spare
the
contragravity
we
going
to
drop
something
on
the
embassy
over
in
town
well
that
was
what
i
wanted
to
call
you
about
contragravity
he
told
about
king
kankad
offer
his
crowd
ought
to
be
coming
in
in
a
couple
of
hours
what
can
you
scrape
up
to
send
to
town
to
airlift
kragans
in
well
we
have
three
one
gun
apiece
the
the
and
the
but
not
much
as
transports
and
we
need
them
here
pretty
badly
then
we
have
five
fertilizer
and
charcoal
scows
and
a
lot
of
heavy
transport
lorries
and
two
pickup
boats
how
about
the
von
schlichten
asked
she
was
due
in
konkrook
from
the
east
about
today
was
she
swore
she
got
in
all
right
but
the
geeks
boarded
her
at
the
dock
within
twenty
minutes
after
things
started
they
tried
to
lift
out
with
her
and
the
channel
battery
shot
her
down
into
konkrook
channel
off
the
fifty
sixth
street
docks
well
you
could
let
the
geeks
have
her
to
use
against
us
what
do
you
hear
from
the
other
ships
at
grank
we
have
had
any
reports
of
any
kind
from
there
which
does
look
so
good
the
is
at
grank
too
the
paul
should
have
been
at
bwork
in
the
east
when
the
gun
went
off
and
the
and
the
de
were
both
at
keegark
we
can
assume
orgzild
has
both
of
them
all
right
i
sending
to
kankad
to
pick
up
more
reenforcements
for
you
we
can
use
them
and
with
we
ought
to
be
able
to
take
the
offensive
against
the
city
by
this
time
tomorrow
anything
else
not
at
the
moment
i
see
about
getting
sent
off
now
leaving
the
booth
he
heard
above
the
clatter
of
and
hubbub
of
voices
jules
keaveney
arguing
contentiously
evidently
colonel
efforts
to
drag
the
resident
out
of
his
despondency
had
been
an
excessive
success
but
it
crazy
not
just
here
everywhere
on
uller
keaveney
was
saying
how
did
they
do
it
they
have
no
telecast
equipment
you
have
me
stopped
jules
mordkovitz
was
replying
i
know
a
lot
of
rich
geeks
have
receiving
sets
but
no
sending
sets
the
pattern
that
had
been
tantalizing
von
schlichten
took
visible
shape
in
his
mind
for
a
moment
he
shelved
the
matter
of
the
they
did
need
sending
equipment
barney
he
said
they
used
ours
what
do
you
mean
keaveney
challenged
look
what
happened
sid
harrington
was
poisoned
in
konkrook
the
news
of
course
was
sent
out
at
once
as
the
geeks
knew
it
would
be
to
every
residency
and
on
uller
and
that
was
the
signal
they
agreed
upon
probably
months
in
advance
all
they
had
to
do
was
have
that
geek
servant
put
poison
in
harrington
whiskey
and
we
did
the
rest
well
what
was
our
intelligence
doing
sleeping
keaveney
demanded
angrily
no
they
were
writing
reports
for
your
civil
administration
blokes
to
stuff
in
the
wastebasket
and
being
called
alarmists
for
their
pains
he
turned
away
from
keaveney
barney
dirk
prinsloo
aboard
his
ship
he
hitched
a
ride
to
the
airport
with
jarman
when
he
was
here
picking
up
call
him
tell
him
to
take
the
to
kankad
town
at
once
as
soon
as
he
arrives
there
which
ought
to
be
about
he
to
pick
up
all
the
kragans
he
can
pack
aboard
and
take
them
to
konkrook
from
then
on
he
be
under
them
orders
to
konkrook
keaveney
fairly
howled
are
you
nuts
do
you
think
we
need
reenforcements
here
too
yes
i
do
i
going
to
try
to
get
them
von
schlichten
told
him
now
pipe
down
and
get
out
of
people
way
he
crossed
the
room
to
where
two
kragans
a
male
sergeant
and
the
ubiquitous
girl
in
the
orange
sweater
were
struggling
to
get
a
big
circular
up
then
turned
to
look
at
the
a
girl
was
keeping
paula
quinton
and
jules
keaveney
informed
start
pushing
geeks
out
of
the
fifth
zirk
cavalry
barracks
the
sergeant
was
saying
the
one
at
the
north
end
and
the
one
next
to
it
they
both
on
fire
now
she
tossed
a
slip
into
the
wastebasket
beside
her
and
glanced
at
the
next
slip
and
more
pink
pills
back
of
the
barracks
and
stables
and
move
them
a
little
to
the
northwest
kragans
as
skirmishers
to
intercept
geeks
trying
to
slip
away
from
the
cavalry
barracks
though
why
we
want
to
do
that
i
do
know
keaveney
said
pushing
out
a
handful
of
pink
pills
with
her
let
them
go
and
good
riddance
i
never
did
like
this
idea
paula
quinton
said
evicting
from
the
two
northern
barracks
there
usually
traffic
on
bridges
kill
them
here
and
we
wo
have
to
worry
about
keeping
them
out
of
course
it
was
easy
to
be
bloodthirsty
about
pink
pills
and
white
pills
once
on
a
voyage
from
yggdrasill
to
loki
he
had
taught
a
couple
of
professors
of
extraterrestrial
zoology
to
play
and
before
the
end
of
the
trip
he
was
being
horrified
by
the
callous
disregard
they
showed
for
casualties
but
little
paula
had
the
right
idea
dead
enemies
do
hit
back
a
young
kragan
with
his
lower
left
arm
in
a
sling
and
a
daub
of
antiseptic
plaster
over
the
back
of
his
head
came
up
and
gave
him
a
radioprint
slip
guido
karamessinis
the
at
grank
had
reported
at
last
the
city
he
said
was
quiet
but
king
troops
had
seized
the
company
airport
and
docks
taken
the
and
the
and
put
guards
aboard
them
and
were
surrounding
the
residency
he
wanted
to
know
what
to
do
von
schlichten
managed
to
get
him
on
the
screen
after
a
while
it
looks
as
though
yoorkerk
trying
to
play
both
sides
at
once
he
told
the
grank
resident
if
the
rebellion
put
down
he
come
forward
as
your
friend
and
protector
if
we
wiped
out
elsewhere
he
yell
suddabit
and
swamp
you
do
antagonize
him
we
ca
afford
to
fight
this
war
on
any
more
fronts
than
we
are
now
we
try
to
do
something
to
get
you
unfrozen
before
long
he
called
krink
again
a
girl
with
hair
and
a
dusting
of
freckles
across
her
nose
answered
how
are
you
making
out
he
asked
so
far
fine
general
we
in
complete
control
of
the
company
area
and
all
our
native
troops
not
just
the
kragans
are
with
us
jonkvank
pushed
the
mutineers
out
of
his
palace
and
we
keeping
open
a
couple
of
streets
between
there
and
here
we
all
our
kragans
and
half
the
sixth
to
the
palace
and
we
have
the
zirks
patrolling
the
streets
on
now
we
have
our
lorries
and
out
picking
up
elements
of
jonkvank
loyal
troops
outside
town
who
doing
the
rioting
then
she
named
three
of
jonkvank
regiments
and
the
city
hoodlums
and
priests
from
the
temples
of
one
sect
that
followed
rakkeed
and
skilkan
fifth
columnists
shapiro
can
give
you
the
details
shall
i
call
him
never
mind
he
probably
busy
he
not
as
easy
on
the
eyes
as
you
are
and
you
doing
all
right
how
long
do
you
think
it
take
with
the
equipment
you
have
to
airlift
all
of
jonkvank
loyal
troops
into
the
city
not
before
this
time
tomorrow
all
right
are
you
in
radio
communication
with
jonkvank
now
full
telecast
the
girl
replied
just
a
minute
general
he
put
in
his
the
screen
exploded
into
light
then
cleared
within
a
few
minutes
a
saurian
ulleran
face
was
looking
out
of
it
at
him
a
elderly
face
with
an
old
scar
along
one
side
your
majesty
von
schlichten
greeted
him
jonkvank
pronounced
something
intended
to
correspond
to
von
schlichten
name
we
have
under
sad
circumstances
general
he
said
sad
for
both
of
us
king
jonkvank
we
must
help
one
another
i
am
told
that
your
soldiers
in
krink
have
risen
against
you
and
that
your
loyal
troops
are
far
from
the
city
yes
that
was
the
work
of
my
war
minister
hurkkurk
who
was
in
the
pay
of
king
firkked
of
skilk
may
jeels
devour
him
alive
i
have
hurkkurk
head
here
somewhere
if
you
want
to
see
it
but
that
will
not
bring
my
loyal
soldiers
to
krink
any
sooner
dead
traitors
heads
do
not
interest
me
king
jonkvank
von
schlichten
replied
in
what
he
estimated
that
the
krinkan
king
would
interpret
as
a
tone
of
cruelty
there
are
too
many
traitors
heads
still
on
traitors
shoulders
what
regiments
are
loyal
to
you
and
where
are
they
now
jonkvank
began
naming
regiments
and
locating
them
all
at
minor
provincial
towns
at
least
a
hundred
miles
from
krink
hurkkurk
did
his
work
well
i
afraid
you
killed
him
too
mercifully
von
schlichten
said
well
i
sending
the
to
krink
she
can
only
bring
in
one
regiment
at
a
trip
the
way
they
scattered
which
one
do
you
want
first
jonkvank
mouth
until
now
compressed
grimly
parted
in
a
gleaming
smile
he
made
an
exclamation
of
pleasure
which
sounded
rather
like
a
boy
running
along
a
picket
fence
with
a
stick
good
general
good
he
cried
the
first
should
be
the
regiment
murderers
at
furnk
they
all
have
rifles
like
your
soldiers
have
them
brought
to
the
great
square
at
the
palace
here
and
then
the
regiment
at
jeelznidd
and
the
regiment
at
let
that
go
until
the
murderers
are
in
von
schlichten
advised
they
at
furnk
you
say
i
send
the
there
directly
oh
good
general
i
will
not
soon
forget
this
and
as
soon
as
the
work
is
finished
here
i
will
send
soldiers
to
help
you
at
skilk
there
shall
be
a
great
pile
of
the
heads
of
those
who
had
part
in
this
wickedness
both
here
and
there
good
now
if
you
will
pardon
me
i
go
to
give
the
necessary
orders
as
he
left
the
booth
he
saw
hideyoshi
in
front
of
the
and
hailed
him
harry
and
hassan
are
getting
the
car
they
dropped
me
off
here
want
to
come
up
with
us
and
see
the
show
no
i
want
you
to
go
to
krink
as
soon
as
harry
brings
the
car
here
again
he
told
what
he
intended
doing
you
probably
have
to
go
around
ahead
of
the
and
alert
these
regiments
and
as
soon
as
things
stabilize
at
krink
prod
jonkvank
into
airlifting
troops
here
you
authorized
in
my
name
to
promise
jonkvank
that
he
can
assume
political
control
at
skilk
after
we
stuffed
firkked
head
in
the
dustbin
jules
keaveney
who
always
seemed
to
be
where
he
was
wanted
heard
that
and
fairly
screamed
general
von
schlichten
that
is
a
political
decision
you
have
no
authority
to
make
promises
like
that
that
is
a
matter
for
the
at
least
well
as
of
now
and
until
a
successor
to
sid
harrington
can
be
sent
here
from
terra
i
von
schlichten
told
him
mentally
thanking
keaveney
for
reminding
him
of
the
necessity
for
such
a
step
captain
malavez
you
will
send
out
an
telecast
immediately
military
carlos
von
schlichten
being
informed
of
the
deaths
of
both
harrington
and
blount
assumes
the
duties
of
as
of
today
he
turned
to
keaveney
does
that
satisfy
you
he
asked
no
it
does
you
have
no
authority
to
assume
a
civil
position
of
any
sort
let
alone
the
very
highest
position
von
schlichten
unbuttoned
his
holster
and
took
out
his
authority
letting
keaveney
look
into
the
muzzle
of
it
here
it
is
he
said
if
you
wise
do
make
me
appeal
to
it
keaveney
shrugged
i
ca
argue
with
that
he
said
but
i
fancy
the
uller
company
is
going
to
be
impressed
by
it
the
uller
company
von
schlichten
replied
is
six
and
a
half
parsecs
away
it
takes
a
ship
six
months
to
get
from
here
to
terra
and
another
six
months
to
get
back
a
radio
message
takes
a
little
over
years
each
way
he
holstered
the
pistol
again
you
were
bitching
about
how
we
needed
reenforcements
a
while
ago
well
here
where
we
have
to
reverse
clausewitz
and
use
politics
as
an
extension
by
other
means
of
war
that
brings
up
another
question
general
one
of
subordinates
said
can
we
hold
out
long
enough
for
help
to
get
here
from
terra
by
the
time
help
could
reach
us
from
terra
von
schlichten
replied
we
either
have
this
revolt
crushed
or
there
wo
be
a
live
terran
left
on
uller
he
felt
a
brief
sadistic
pleasure
as
he
watched
keaveney
face
sag
in
horror
what
do
you
think
we
live
on
for
a
year
he
asked
on
this
planet
there
not
more
than
a
three
months
supply
of
any
sort
of
food
a
human
can
eat
and
the
ships
that
be
coming
in
until
word
of
our
plight
can
get
to
terra
bring
enough
to
keep
us
going
we
need
the
farms
and
livestock
and
the
culture
plant
at
konkrook
and
the
farms
at
krink
and
on
the
plateau
back
of
skilk
and
we
need
peace
and
native
labor
to
work
them
nobody
seemed
to
have
anything
to
say
after
that
for
a
while
then
keaveney
suggested
that
the
next
ship
was
due
in
from
niflheim
in
three
months
and
that
it
could
be
used
to
evacuate
all
the
terrans
on
uller
and
i
personally
shoot
any
terran
who
tries
to
board
that
ship
von
schlichten
promised
get
this
through
your
heads
all
of
you
we
are
going
to
break
this
rebellion
and
we
are
going
to
hold
uller
for
the
company
and
the
terran
federation
he
looked
around
him
now
get
back
to
work
all
of
you
he
told
the
group
that
had
formed
around
him
and
keaveney
miss
quinton
you
just
heard
me
order
my
adjutant
colonel
on
detached
duty
to
krink
i
want
you
to
take
over
for
him
you
have
rank
and
authority
as
colonel
for
the
duration
of
this
war
she
was
thunderstruck
but
i
know
absolutely
nothing
about
military
matters
there
must
be
a
hundred
people
here
who
are
better
qualified
than
i
am
there
are
and
they
all
have
jobs
and
i
have
to
find
replacements
for
them
and
replacements
for
the
replacements
you
wo
leave
any
vacancy
to
be
filled
and
you
learn
fast
enough
he
went
over
to
the
again
and
looked
at
the
arrangement
of
pink
and
white
pills
first
of
all
i
want
you
to
call
jarman
at
the
military
airport
and
have
an
airjeep
and
driver
sent
around
here
for
me
going
up
and
have
a
look
around
barney
keep
the
show
going
while
out
and
tell
colonel
quinton
what
it
all
about
ix
do
push
them
anywhere
put
them
back
in
the
bottle
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
stood
for
a
moment
pumping
the
stale
air
and
of
the
telecast
station
out
of
his
lungs
as
the
light
airjeep
let
down
into
the
street
two
hours
and
a
half
since
the
mutiny
at
the
barracks
had
broken
out
the
company
reservation
was
still
ablaze
with
lights
and
over
the
roof
of
the
hospital
and
dispensary
and
he
could
see
the
glare
of
the
burning
barracks
there
was
more
to
the
south
in
the
direction
of
the
park
and
the
camp
and
from
that
direction
the
bulk
of
the
firing
was
to
be
heard
the
driver
a
young
lieutenant
who
seemed
to
be
of
predominantly
malayan
and
polynesian
blood
slid
back
the
duraglass
canopy
for
him
to
climb
in
then
snapped
it
into
place
when
he
had
strapped
himself
into
his
seat
can
you
handle
the
armament
sir
he
asked
von
schlichten
nodded
approvingly
not
a
very
flattering
question
but
the
boy
was
right
to
make
sure
before
they
started
out
i
done
it
once
or
twice
he
understated
let
go
i
want
a
look
at
what
going
on
down
at
the
and
the
first
they
lifted
up
the
driver
turning
the
nose
of
the
airjeep
in
the
direction
of
the
flames
and
explosions
and
to
the
south
and
tapping
his
gently
the
vehicle
shot
forward
and
came
floating
in
over
the
scene
of
the
fighting
the
at
the
improvised
headquarters
had
shown
a
mixture
of
pink
and
white
pills
in
the
park
something
was
going
to
have
to
be
done
about
the
lag
in
correcting
it
for
the
area
was
entirely
in
the
hands
of
loyal
company
troops
and
the
mob
of
laborers
and
mutinous
soldiers
had
been
pushed
back
into
the
temporary
camp
where
the
workers
had
been
gathered
to
await
transportation
to
the
arctic
as
he
feared
the
rioting
workers
many
of
whom
were
trained
to
handle
contragravity
equipment
had
managed
to
lift
up
a
number
of
and
powershovels
and
bulldozers
intending
to
use
them
as
improvised
airtanks
but
jarman
had
gotten
on
the
job
promptly
and
all
of
these
had
been
shot
down
and
were
lying
in
wreckage
mostly
among
the
rows
of
parked
from
the
a
surprising
volume
of
fire
was
being
directed
against
the
attack
which
had
already
started
from
the
retaken
this
was
just
another
evidence
of
the
failure
of
intelligence
and
the
constabulary
and
consequently
of
himself
to
anticipate
the
brewing
storm
there
was
of
course
practically
no
chance
of
keeping
ullerans
from
having
native
weapons
swords
knives
even
bows
and
and
a
certain
number
of
automatic
pistols
could
be
expected
but
most
of
the
fire
was
coming
from
military
rifles
and
now
and
then
he
could
see
the
backflash
of
a
recoilless
rifle
or
a
bazooka
or
the
steady
flicker
of
a
even
if
a
few
of
these
weapons
had
been
brought
from
the
barracks
by
retreating
tenth
infantry
or
fifth
cavalry
mutineers
there
were
still
too
many
hovering
above
the
fighting
aloof
from
it
he
saw
six
long
land
and
disgorge
kragan
rifles
who
had
been
released
by
the
liquidation
of
resistance
at
the
barracks
a
little
later
two
airtanks
floated
in
and
then
two
more
going
off
contragravity
and
lumbering
on
treads
to
fire
their
rifles
at
the
same
time
swooped
in
banging
away
with
their
lighter
and
launching
rockets
the
titanium
set
up
to
house
the
laborers
and
intended
to
be
taken
north
with
them
for
their
stay
on
the
polar
desert
were
simply
wiped
away
among
the
wreckage
resistance
was
being
blown
out
like
the
lights
of
a
candelabrum
push
the
white
pills
out
girls
he
thought
do
push
them
anywhere
put
them
back
in
the
bottle
this
year
there
would
be
any
mining
done
at
the
north
pole
next
year
the
stockholders
be
bitching
about
their
and
a
lot
of
new
machine
operators
are
going
to
have
to
be
trained
for
next
year
mining
if
there
is
any
mining
next
year
he
took
up
the
and
called
hq
von
schlichten
what
the
wavelength
of
the
officer
in
command
at
the
a
voice
at
the
telecast
station
furnished
it
he
punched
it
out
von
schlichten
right
overhead
that
you
major
falkenberg
nice
going
major
how
are
your
casualties
not
too
bad
twenty
or
thirty
kragans
and
loyal
skilkans
and
eight
terrans
killed
about
as
many
wounded
pretty
good
considering
what
you
running
into
get
many
of
your
kragans
mounted
on
those
hipposaurs
about
a
hundred
a
lot
of
got
shot
while
we
were
leading
them
out
from
the
stables
well
i
can
see
geeks
streaming
away
from
the
out
the
south
end
going
in
the
direction
of
the
river
use
what
cavalry
you
have
on
them
and
what
contragravity
you
can
spare
i
drop
a
few
flares
to
show
their
position
and
direction
anticipating
him
the
driver
turned
the
airjeep
and
started
toward
the
dry
hoork
river
von
schlichten
nodded
approval
and
told
him
to
release
flares
when
over
the
fugitives
right
falkenberg
replied
i
get
on
it
at
once
general
and
start
moving
that
up
into
the
company
area
some
of
it
we
can
put
into
the
air
the
rest
we
can
use
to
build
barricades
none
of
it
do
we
want
the
geeks
getting
hold
of
and
the
outside
our
practical
perimeter
i
send
people
to
help
you
move
it
no
need
to
do
that
sir
i
have
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
loyal
north
ullerans
foremen
technicians
overseers
who
can
handle
it
all
right
use
your
own
judgment
put
the
stuff
back
of
the
barracks
and
between
the
and
the
company
and
anywhere
else
you
can
the
lieutenant
nudged
him
and
pushed
a
couple
of
buttons
on
the
dashboard
here
go
the
flares
now
immediately
a
couple
of
airjeeps
pounced
in
to
strafe
the
fleeing
enemy
somebody
must
have
already
been
issuing
orders
on
another
wavelength
a
number
of
kragans
riding
hipposaurs
were
galloping
into
the
light
of
the
flares
now
let
have
a
look
at
the
native
barracks
and
the
he
said
and
then
we
make
a
circuit
around
the
reservation
about
two
or
three
miles
out
i
not
happy
about
where
firkked
army
is
the
driver
looked
at
him
i
been
worrying
about
that
too
sir
he
said
i
ca
understand
why
he
has
jumped
us
already
i
know
it
takes
time
to
get
one
of
these
geek
armies
on
the
road
but
he
hoping
our
native
troops
and
the
mine
laborers
will
be
able
to
wipe
us
out
themselves
von
schlichten
said
for
the
timidity
and
stupidity
of
our
enemies
allah
make
us
truly
thankful
amen
something
no
commander
should
depend
on
but
be
glad
when
it
happens
if
firkked
had
had
a
couple
of
regiments
on
hand
outside
the
reservation
to
jump
us
as
soon
as
the
tenth
and
the
zirks
mutinied
he
could
have
swamped
us
in
twenty
minutes
and
we
all
have
had
our
throats
cut
by
now
there
was
nothing
going
on
in
the
area
between
the
native
barracks
and
the
mountains
except
some
sporadic
firing
as
small
patrols
of
kragans
clashed
with
clumps
of
fleeing
mutineers
all
the
barracks
even
those
of
the
rifles
were
burning
the
around
the
and
the
and
the
explosives
magazines
were
still
on
most
of
the
floodlights
were
still
on
and
there
was
still
some
fighting
around
the
it
looked
as
though
the
survivors
of
the
tenth
were
in
a
few
small
pockets
which
were
being
squeezed
out
there
was
nothing
at
all
going
on
north
of
the
reservation
the
countryside
by
day
a
checkerboard
of
walled
fields
and
small
villages
was
dark
except
for
a
dim
light
here
and
there
where
the
occupants
of
some
farmhouse
had
been
awakened
by
the
noise
of
battle
the
airjeep
dropped
lower
and
the
driver
slid
open
the
window
beside
him
von
schlichten
could
hear
the
grunts
and
snorts
and
squawks
of
similarly
aroused
then
two
miles
east
of
the
reservation
he
caught
a
new
sound
the
flowing
riverlike
murmur
of
something
vast
on
the
move
hear
that
lieutenant
he
asked
head
for
it
at
about
a
thousand
feet
when
we
directly
above
it
let
go
some
flares
yes
sir
the
younger
man
had
lowered
his
voice
to
a
whisper
that
geek
headed
for
the
reservation
maybe
firkked
army
von
schlichten
thought
aloud
or
maybe
a
city
mob
not
quite
noisy
enough
for
a
mob
is
it
sir
a
tired
mob
von
schlichten
told
him
they
start
out
on
a
run
yelling
by
the
time
they
got
across
the
bridges
to
this
side
of
the
river
they
be
winded
they
stop
for
a
blow
and
then
they
settle
down
to
steady
slogging
to
save
their
wind
sometimes
a
mob
like
that
worse
than
a
fresh
mob
they
get
stubborn
they
act
more
deliberately
the
noises
were
growing
clearer
louder
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
punched
the
wavelength
of
the
military
airport
von
schlichten
my
compliments
to
colonel
jarman
tell
him
there
a
geek
mob
or
possibly
firkked
regulars
on
the
main
highway
from
skilk
two
miles
east
of
the
reservation
get
some
combat
contragravity
over
here
at
once
we
light
them
up
for
you
and
tell
colonel
jarman
to
start
flying
patrols
up
and
down
along
the
hoork
river
this
may
not
be
the
only
gang
that
coming
out
to
see
us
the
sounds
were
directly
below
now
the
scuffing
of
feet
on
the
dirt
road
the
clink
and
rattle
of
slung
weapons
the
clicking
and
squeeking
of
ulleran
voices
the
lieutenant
said
here
go
the
flares
sir
von
schlichten
shut
his
eyes
then
opened
them
slowly
the
driver
upon
releasing
the
flares
had
nosed
up
banked
turned
and
was
coming
in
again
down
the
road
toward
the
advancing
column
von
schlichten
peered
into
his
sight
his
foot
on
the
pedal
and
his
fingers
on
the
rocket
buttons
the
highway
below
was
jammed
with
geeks
and
they
were
all
stopped
dead
and
staring
upward
as
though
hypnotized
by
the
lights
a
second
later
they
had
recovered
and
were
shooting
not
at
the
airjeep
but
at
the
four
globes
of
blazing
magnesium
then
he
had
the
mass
of
in
his
sights
he
tramped
the
pedal
and
began
punching
buttons
he
still
had
four
rockets
left
by
the
time
the
mob
was
behind
him
all
right
let
take
another
pass
at
them
same
direction
the
driver
put
the
airjeep
into
a
quick
loop
and
came
out
of
it
in
front
of
the
mob
who
now
had
their
backs
turned
and
were
staring
in
the
direction
in
which
they
had
last
seen
the
vehicle
again
von
schlichten
plowed
them
with
rockets
and
harrowed
them
with
his
guns
some
of
the
skilkans
were
trying
to
get
over
the
high
fences
on
either
side
of
the
road
really
stockades
of
petrified
others
were
firing
and
this
time
they
were
shooting
at
the
airjeep
it
took
one
hit
from
a
heavy
and
immediately
the
driver
banked
and
turned
away
from
the
road
dammit
why
did
you
do
that
von
schlichten
demanded
lifting
his
foot
from
the
are
you
afraid
of
the
kind
of
popguns
those
geeks
are
using
i
am
not
afraid
to
risk
my
vehicle
or
myself
sir
the
lieutenant
replied
with
the
extreme
formality
of
a
very
junior
officer
chewing
out
a
very
senior
one
i
am
however
afraid
to
risk
my
passenger
generals
are
not
expendable
sir
neither
are
they
issued
for
use
as
clay
pigeons
he
was
right
of
course
von
schlichten
admitted
it
i
too
old
to
play
cowboy
like
this
he
said
back
to
the
reservation
telecast
station
looking
back
over
his
shoulder
he
saw
eight
or
ten
more
flares
alight
and
the
of
exploding
shells
and
rockets
the
air
above
the
road
was
sparkling
with
jarman
must
have
had
some
contragravity
ready
to
be
sent
off
on
the
instant
while
he
had
been
out
somebody
had
gotten
a
mounted
on
a
and
run
up
to
two
thousand
feet
on
the
end
of
a
tensilon
the
big
circular
screen
was
lit
showing
the
whole
company
reservation
with
the
surrounding
countryside
foreshortened
by
perspective
to
the
distant
lights
of
skilk
the
map
had
been
taken
up
from
the
floor
and
a
big
had
been
brought
in
from
the
chief
engineer
office
and
set
up
in
its
place
in
front
of
the
screen
paula
quinton
barney
mordkovitz
colonel
and
conspicuously
silent
jules
keaveney
sat
drinking
coffee
and
munching
sandwiches
half
a
dozen
terrans
of
both
sexes
were
working
furiously
to
get
the
markers
which
replaced
the
pink
and
white
pills
placed
on
the
board
and
one
of
captain
inez
malavez
with
a
headset
was
getting
combat
reports
directly
from
the
switchboard
everything
was
clicking
like
machinery
on
the
the
residency
area
was
ablaze
with
light
and
so
were
the
the
airport
and
spaceport
the
shops
and
the
on
the
the
latter
was
now
marked
as
completely
in
company
hands
the
ruins
of
the
barracks
were
still
burning
and
there
was
a
twinkle
of
here
and
there
among
the
ruins
of
the
much
of
the
equipment
for
the
polar
mines
had
already
been
shifted
into
defensible
ground
the
rest
of
the
circle
was
dark
except
for
the
distant
lights
of
skilk
where
the
nuclear
power
plant
was
apparently
still
functioning
in
native
hands
then
without
warning
a
spot
of
white
light
blazed
into
being
southeast
of
the
company
area
and
southwest
of
skilk
followed
by
another
and
another
instantly
von
schlichten
glanced
up
at
the
row
of
smaller
screens
and
on
one
of
them
saw
the
view
as
picked
up
by
a
patrolling
airjeep
the
army
of
king
firkked
of
skilk
had
finally
put
in
its
appearance
coming
in
two
columns
one
southward
from
skilk
and
the
other
northward
along
the
west
bank
of
the
dry
river
the
former
had
crossed
over
and
joined
the
latter
about
three
miles
south
of
the
reservation
the
scene
in
the
screen
was
similar
to
the
one
he
had
himself
witnessed
through
his
the
skilkan
regulars
had
been
marching
in
formation
some
on
the
road
and
some
along
parallel
lanes
and
paths
they
had
the
look
of
trained
and
disciplined
troops
but
they
had
made
the
same
mistake
as
the
rabble
that
had
been
shot
up
on
the
north
side
of
the
reservation
unused
to
attack
from
the
air
they
had
all
halted
in
place
and
were
gaping
their
opal
teeth
gleaming
in
the
white
however
before
the
aircar
had
passed
over
them
the
lead
company
of
one
regiment
armed
with
terran
rifles
had
begun
firing
in
the
big
screen
it
could
be
seen
that
colonel
jarman
had
thrown
most
of
his
available
contragravity
at
them
including
the
that
had
already
started
to
form
the
second
wave
of
the
attack
on
the
mob
to
the
north
other
flares
bloomed
in
the
darkness
and
the
fiery
trails
of
rockets
curved
downward
to
end
in
yellow
flashes
on
the
ground
the
airjeep
with
the
pickup
circled
back
the
troops
on
the
road
and
in
the
adjoining
fields
had
broken
the
former
were
caught
between
the
fences
which
made
ulleran
roads
such
when
under
the
latter
had
dispersed
and
were
running
away
individually
and
by
squads
at
first
it
looked
like
a
panic
but
he
could
see
officers
signaling
to
the
larger
groups
of
fugitives
to
open
out
apparently
directing
the
flight
by
this
time
there
were
ten
or
twelve
and
about
twenty
airjeeps
at
work
in
the
moving
view
from
the
he
saw
what
looked
like
a
rocket
land
in
the
middle
of
a
company
that
was
still
trying
to
defend
itself
with
fire
on
the
road
wiping
out
about
half
of
them
make
the
most
of
it
boys
barney
mordkovitz
his
mouth
full
of
sandwich
was
saying
heave
it
to
them
you
wo
get
another
chance
like
that
at
those
buggers
why
not
colonel
paula
quinton
wanted
to
know
her
military
education
was
progressing
but
it
still
had
a
few
gaps
to
fill
in
the
next
time
they
they
wo
stay
bunched
mordkovitz
replied
a
lot
of
them
did
stay
bunched
this
time
if
you
noticed
and
they
keep
out
from
between
the
fences
in
the
large
screen
a
quick
succession
of
leaped
up
from
the
direction
of
the
hoork
river
and
shells
began
bursting
over
the
scene
of
the
attack
the
screen
tuned
to
the
pickup
on
the
airjeep
went
dead
in
the
big
screen
there
was
a
twinkling
of
falling
fire
almost
at
once
thirty
or
forty
converged
on
the
and
for
a
moment
explosions
burned
like
a
bonfire
they
had
a
at
the
rear
of
the
column
somebody
called
from
the
big
switchboard
lieutenant
kalanang
jeep
was
hit
lieutenant
vermaas
is
cutting
in
his
pickup
on
the
same
wavelength
the
small
screen
lighted
again
in
the
big
screen
a
cluster
of
appeared
above
where
the
skilkan
gun
had
been
in
the
small
screen
there
was
a
stubbled
pocked
with
craters
and
the
bodies
of
fifteen
or
twenty
natives
all
rather
badly
mangled
an
overturned
and
apparently
destroyed
gun
lay
on
its
side
five
or
six
fairly
large
fires
had
broken
out
by
this
time
around
the
point
of
attack
von
schlichten
nodded
approvingly
i
was
wondering
how
long
it
take
somebody
to
think
of
that
he
said
granaries
and
on
some
of
these
farms
burn
for
half
an
hour
at
least
he
looked
at
his
watch
and
by
that
time
it
be
daylight
as
far
as
we
know
that
was
the
only
gun
firkked
had
colonel
said
he
has
at
least
six
possibly
ten
it
a
wonder
we
have
seen
anything
of
them
well
there
no
way
of
being
sure
jules
keaveney
said
but
i
have
an
idea
they
all
at
or
around
the
palace
firkked
knows
about
how
much
contragravity
we
have
he
probably
wondering
why
we
bombing
him
now
he
does
know
we
sold
the
palace
to
king
jonkvank
for
an
army
von
schlichten
said
and
that
reminds
me
how
much
contragravity
could
firkked
scrape
together
for
an
attack
on
us
i
been
expecting
a
geek
over
here
at
any
moment
colonel
studied
the
smoking
tip
of
his
cigarette
for
a
moment
well
firkked
owns
personally
three
aircars
a
thing
like
a
that
he
transports
some
of
his
courtiers
around
in
four
airjeeps
armed
with
a
pair
of
apiece
and
two
big
lorries
there
are
possibly
two
hundred
vehicles
of
all
types
in
skilk
and
the
country
around
but
some
of
them
are
in
the
hands
of
natives
friendly
to
us
and
or
hostile
to
firkked
i
can
get
the
exact
figures
from
the
constabulary
office
at
company
house
that
close
enough
von
schlichten
told
him
and
there
be
oodles
of
and
blasting
explosives
colonel
quinton
suppose
you
call
ed
wallingsby
the
chief
engineer
right
away
have
him
commissioned
colonel
tell
him
to
get
to
work
making
this
place
secure
against
air
attack
tell
him
to
consult
with
colonel
jarman
tell
him
to
get
those
geeks
leavitt
has
penned
in
the
at
the
airport
and
use
them
to
dig
and
fill
sandbags
and
so
on
he
can
use
kragan
wounded
to
guard
them
keaveney
you
begin
setting
up
something
in
the
way
of
an
you
have
to
get
along
on
what
nobody
else
wants
you
will
also
consult
with
colonel
jarman
and
with
colonel
wallingsby
better
get
started
on
it
now
just
think
of
everything
around
here
that
could
go
wrong
in
case
of
an
air
attack
and
try
to
do
something
about
it
in
advance
x
the
geek
luftwaffe
and
the
kragan
airlift
at
an
attack
developed
on
the
northwestern
corner
of
the
reservation
in
the
direction
of
the
explosives
magazines
it
turned
out
to
be
relatively
trivial
remnants
of
the
mob
that
had
been
broken
up
by
air
attack
on
the
road
had
gotten
together
and
were
making
rushes
in
small
bands
keeping
well
spread
out
beating
them
off
took
considerable
ammunition
but
it
was
accomplished
with
negligible
casualties
to
the
defenders
they
finally
stopped
coming
around
daylight
in
the
meantime
themistocles
called
from
konkrook
appearing
in
the
screen
with
his
left
arm
in
a
freshly
white
sling
what
the
hell
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
von

an
hour
ago

have
a
on

out

kankad
people
started
coming
in
yet
oh
yes
about
six
hundred
of
them
have
gotten
in
already
in
the
damnedest
collection
of
vehicles
you
ever
saw
kankad
must
be
using
every
scrap
of
contragravity
he
has
it
a
regular
airborne
kankad
sent
word
that
he
coming
here
in
person
as
soon
as
he
has
things
organized
at
his
place
and
the
geeks
here
have
scraped
together
an
of
their
own
aircars
that
sort
of
thing
and
they
using
them
to
bomb
us
here
and
at
the
mainland
farm
mostly
with
nitroglycerine
we
shot
down
about
twenty
of
them
but
they
still
coming
they
tried
a
across
the
channel
that
how
i
got
this
we
been
doing
some
bombing
ourselves
we
made
a
down
payment
for
eric
blount
and
hendrik
lemoyne
took
a
tank
off
a
fitted
it
with
a
detonator
filled
it
with
thermoconcentrate
and
ferried
it
over
on
the
and
dumped
it
on
the
keegarkan
embassy
it
must
have
landed
in
the
middle
of
the
central
court
in
about
fifteen
seconds
flames
were
coming
out
every
window
in
the
place
his
face
became
less
jovial
we
had
something
pretty
bad
happen
here
too
he
said
that
konkrook
fencibles
rabble
of
prince
jaizerd
mutinied
along
with
the
others
they
got
into
the
hospital
and
butchered
everybody
in
the
place
patients
and
staff
the
kragans
got
there
too
late
to
save
anybody
but
they
wiped
out
the
fencibles
jaizerd
himself
was
the
only
one
they
took
alive
and
he
did
stay
that
way
very
long
how
are
you
making
out
with
your
civil
administration
crowd
grimaced
i
have
had
to
put
any
of
them
under
actual
arrest
so
far
but
we
had
to
keep
buhrmann
away
from
the
communications
equipment
by
force
he
wanted
to
call
you
up
and
chew
you
out
for
not
evacuating
everybody
in
the
north
to
konkrook
is
he
crazy
no
just
scared
he
says
you
going
to
get
everybody
on
uller
massacred
by
detail
when
you
could
save
konkrook
by
bringing
them
all
here
you
tell
him
i
going
to
hold
this
planet
not
just
one
city
tell
him
i
have
a
sense
of
my
duty
to
the
company
and
its
stockholders
if
he
has
put
it
in
those
terms
and
he
may
understand
you
yes

taking
on
this
deal
well
i

when
there
anything

by
it
was
daylight
the
attacks
against
the
northwest
corner
of

perimeter
stopped
entirely
wallingsby

the
skilkan

was
doing
an
efficient

in

colonel

his
airjeeps
and
working
in
circles
over
the
countryside
shooting
up
everything
in
sight
that
even
looked
like
contragravity
equipment
some
of
these
patrols
had
to
be
recalled
around
when
sporadic
began
from
the
side
of
the
mountain
to
the
west
and
along
with
everything
else
paula

managed
along
with
her
other
work
to
get
a
complete
digest
prepared
of
the
situation
elsewhere
in
the
parts
of
the
planet
the
situation
at
konkrook
was
brightening
steadily
the
second
wave
of
kankad
improvised
airlift
reenforced
by
contragravity
from
konkrook
had
come
in
there
were
now
close
to
two
thousand
fresh
kragans
on
gongonk
island
and
the
mainland
farms
kankad
himself
with
them
the
had
reached
kankad
town
and
was
loading
another
thousand
kragans
there
was
nothing
more
from
keegark
a
message
from
colonel
mackinnon
had
come
in
at
dawn
to
the
effect
that
the
geeks
had
penetrated
his
last
defenses
and
that
he
was
about
to
blow
up
the
residency
thereafter
keegark
went
off

with

by

then
to
eight
guido
karamessinis
at

was
still
at
uneasy
peace
with
king
yoorkerk
who
was
still
undecided
whether
the
rebels
or
the
company
were
going
to
be
the
eventual
victors
and
afraid
to
take
any
irrevocable
step
in
either

reached

in
a

another
trading
station
on

reported
by

that
the
natives
there
had
refused
to
rise
against
them
and
had
crucified
five
of
rakkeed
disciples
who
had
come
among
them
preaching
at
paula
quinton
and
barney
mordkovitz
virtually
ordered
him
to
get
some
sleep
he
went
to
his
quarters
at
company
house
downed
a
drink
of
and
slept
until
as
he
dressed
and
shaved
he
could
hear
through
the
open
window
the
slow
sputter
of
fire
punctuated
by
the
occasional
of
or
the
hammering
of
a
returning
to
his
at
the
telecast
station
the
showed
that
the
perimeter
of
defense
had
been
pushed
out
in
a
bulge
at
the
northwest
corner
the
pictured
a
crude
of
petrified
sandbags
mining
machinery
and
upon
which
wallingsby
native
laborers
were
working
under
guard
while
a
of
kragans
had
been
thrown
out
another
four
or
five
hundred
yards
and
were
exchanging
with
skilkans
on
the
gullied
hillside
where
colonel
quinton
he
asked
she
ought
to
be
taking
a
turn
in
the
sack
now
she
taking
one
major
falkenberg
who
had
commanded
the
action
at
the
barracks
and
the
the
night
before
told
him
general
mordkovitz
chased
her
off
to
bed
a
couple
of
hours
ago
called
me
in
to
take
her
place
and
then
went
out
to
replace
me
colonel
guilliford
in
the
hospital
got
hit
about
thirteen
hundred
they
afraid
he
going
to
lose
a
leg
that
a
bloody
shame
he
pointed
to
the
northwest
corner
of
the
perimeter
on
the
screen
whose
idea
was
that
he
asked
it
a
good
one
i
ought
to
have
thought
of
it
myself
your
new
adjutant
falkenberg
grinned
she
asked
somebody
what
those
big
domes
up
there
were
when
they
told
her
there
were
ten
thousand
tons
of
thermoconcentrate
five
thousand
tons
of
and
five
tons
of
plutonium
under
them
she
damned
near
fainted
and
then
she
ordered
that
right
away
more
reports
came
in
the
entire
garrison
of
the
small
residency
at
kwurk
the
most
northern
of
the
eastern
shore
free
cities
had
arrived
at
kankad
town
in
two
contragravity
scows
and
five
aircars
two
of
the
aircars
arrived
half
an
hour
behind
the
rest
of
the
refugee
flotilla
having
turned
off
at
keegark
to
pay
their
respects
to
king
orgzild
they
reported
the
keegark
residency
in
ruins
its
central
buildings
vanished
in
a
huge
crater
the
and
the
de
were
still
in
the
company
docks
both
apparently
damaged
by
the
blast
which
had
destroyed
the
residency
one
of
the
aircars
had
rocketed
and
some
keegarkans
who
appeared
to
be
trying
to
repair
them
the
other
blew
up
king
orgzild
nitroglycerine
plant
von
schlichten
called
konkrook
and
ordered
a
against
keegark
organized
to
make
sure
the
two
ships
stayed
out
of
service
the
was
still
bringing
loyal
troops
into
krink
king
jonkvank
whom
von
schlichten
called
was
highly
elated
we
are
killing
traitors
wherever
we
find
them
he
exulted
the
city
is
yellow
with
their
blood
their
heads
are
piled
everywhere
how
is
it
with
you
at
skilk
we
have
killed
many
also
von
schlichten
boasted
and
tonight
we
will
kill
more
we
are
preparing
bombs
of
great
destruction
which
we
will
rain
down
upon
skilk
until
there
is
not
one
stone
left
upon
another
or
one
infant
of
a
day
age
left
alive
jonkvank
reacted
as
he
was
intended
to
oh
no
general
do
do
all
that
he
exclaimed
you
promised
me
that
i
should
have
skilk
on
the
word
of
a
terran
are
you
going
to
give
me
a
city
of
ruins
and
corpses
ruins
are
no
good
to
anybody
and
i
am
not
a
jeel
to
eat
corpses
von
schlichten
shrugged
when
you
are
strong
you
can
flog
your
enemies
with
a
whip
when
you
are
weak
all
you
can
do
is
kill
them
if
i
had
five
thousand
more
troops
here
oh
i
will
send
troops
as
soon
as
i
can
jonkvank
hastened
to
promise
all
my
best
regiments
the
murderers
the
the
the
devastators
the
but
now
that
we
have
stopped
this
sinful
rebellion
here
i
ca
take
chances
that
it
will
break
out
again
as
soon
as
i
strip
the
city
of
troops
von
schlichten
nodded
jonkvank
argument
made
sense
he
would
have
taken
a
similar
position
himself
well
get
as
many
as
you
can
over
here
as
soon
as
possible
he
said
we
try
to
do
as
little
damage
to
skilk
as
we
can
but
at
paula
joined
him
for
her
breakfast
while
he
sat
in
front
of
the
big
screen
eating
his
dinner
there
had
been
light
along
the
southern
end
of
the
perimeter
king
firkked
regulars
reenforced
by
zirk
tribesmen
and
levies
of
townspeople
all
of
whom
seemed
to
have
firearms
were
filtering
in
through
the
ruins
of
the
and
the
wreckage
of
the
and
there
was
renewed
sniping
from
the
mountainside
the
long
afternoon
of
the
northern
autumn
dragged
on
finally
at
the
sun
set
and
it
was
not
fully
dark
for
another
hour
for
some
time
there
was
an
ominous
quiet
and
then
at
the
enemy
began
attacking
in
force
driving
herds
of
livestock
lumbering
brutes
bred
by
the
north
ullerans
for
food
to
test
the
defenses
for
electrified
wire
and
most
of
these
were
shot
down
or
blown
up
but
a
few
got
as
far
as
the
wire
which
by
now
had
been
strung
and
electrified
completely
around
the
perimeter
behind
them
came
parties
of
skilkan
regulars
with
insulated
cutters
a
couple
of
cuts
were
made
in
the
wire
and
a
section
of
it
went
dead
the
line
at
this
point
had
been
rather
thinly
held
the
defenders
immediately
called
for
and
jarman
ordered
fifteen
of
his
remaining
twenty
airjeeps
and
five
into
the
fight
no
sooner
were
they
committed
than
the
radar
on
the
commercial
airport
picked
up
air
vehicles
approaching
from
the
north
and
the
sirens
began
howling
and
the
searchlights
went
on
as
a
protection
from
the
sudden
fury
of
the
summer
and
winter
gales
the
buildings
were
all
low
and
provided
with
steel
doors
and
which
were
electrically
operated
and
centrally
controlled
these
slammed
shut
in
every
occupied
building
the
contragravity
which
had
been
sent
to
support
the

the
south
side
of
the
reservation
turned
to
meet
this
new
threat
and
everything
else
available
including
the
four
heavy
airtanks
lifted
up
meanwhile
guns
began
firing
from
the
ground
and
from
rooftops
there
had
been
four
aircars
ordinary
passenger
vehicles
equipped
with
on
improvised
mounts
and
ten
big
lorries
converted
into
bombers
in
the
attack
all
the
lorries
and
all
but
one
of
the
makeshift
were
shot
down
but
not
before
explosive
and
thermoconcentrate
bombs
were
dumped
all
over
the
place
one
lorry
emptied
its
load
of
on
the
at
the

starting
a
raging
fire
and
putting
the

out
of

a
at

set
on

and
a
quantity
of
and
ammunition
piled
outside

in

of
the

before
the
had
been
broken
up
the
soldiers
of
king
firkked
and
their
irregular
supporters
were
swarming
through
the
dead
section
of
wire
they
had
four
or
five
big
but
unequipped
with
which
they
were
using
like
of
the
first
century
this
attack
penetrated
to
the
middle
of
the
reservation
before
it
was
stopped
and
the
attackers
either
killed
or
driven
out
for
the
first
time
since
daybreak
the
lights
came
on
around
the
as
soon
as
the
combined
air
and
ground
attack
was
beaten
off
von
schlichten
ordered
all
his
available
contragravity
up
flying
patrols
around
the
reservation
and
retaliatory
bombing
missions
against
skilk
and
began
bombarding
the
city
with
his
guns
a
number
of
fires
broke
out
and
at
about
a
huge
expanding
globe
of
flame
soared
up
from
the
city
there
goes
firkked
thermoconcentrate
stock
he
said
to
paula
who
was
standing
beside
him
in
front
of
the
screen
half
an
hour
later
he
discovered
that
he
had
been
overly
optimistic
much
of
the
enemy
supply
of
terran
thermoconcentrate
had
been
destroyed
but
enough
remained
to
pelt
the
reservation
and
the
company
buildings
with
incendiaries
when
a
second
and
more
severe
developed
consisting
of
forty
or
fifty
makeshift
and
fifteen
aircars
the
previous
attack
von
schlichten
had
viewed
in
the
screen
at
the
telecast
station
it
was
his
questionable
good
fortune
to
observe
the
second
one
directly
having
been
out
inspecting
the
defenses
around
the
at
the
time
like
the
first
the
second
was
beaten
off
or
more
exactly
down
most
of
the
enemy
contragravity
was
destroyed
at
least
two
dozen
vehicles
crashed
inside
the
reservation
as
in
the
first
instance
there
was
a
simultaneous
ground
attack
from
the
southern
side
with
a
at
the
north
end
for
a
while
von
schlichten
found
himself
fighting
first
with
his
pistol
and
then
when
his
ammunition
was
gone
with
a
rifle
and
bayonet
it
was
full
daylight
before
the
last
of
the
attackers
was
either
killed
or
driven
out
five
minutes
later
while
he
was
reloading
his
with
salvaged
cartridges
the
came
bulking
over
the
mountains
from
the
west
xi
of
princedoms
which
have
been
won
by
conquest
holstering
his
pistol
he
raced
for
the
telecast
station
to
receive
a
call
from
a
colonel
khalid
talal
a
zanzibar
arab
aboard
the
approaching
ship
i
one
of
jonkvank
regiments
the
armed
with
terran
rifles
and
a
few
bazookas
i
have
a
company
of
our
zirks
with
their
mounts
and
a
battalion
of
the
sixth
i
also
have
four
guns
he
reported
what
the
situation
general
and
where
do
you
want
me
to
land
von
schlichten
described
the
situation
succinctly
in
an
ancient
and
unprintable
military
cliche
try
landing
south
of
the
reservation
a
little
west
of
the
ruins
of
the
he
advised
the
bulk
of
firkked
army
is
in
that
section
and
i
want
them
run
out
as
soon
as
possible
we
give
you
all
the
contragravity
and
fire
support
we
can
the
let
down
slowly
firing
her
guns
and
dropping
bombs
as
she
descended
spurted
from
all
her
portholes
there
was
cheering
human
and
ulleran
from
inside
the
battered
airjeeps
and
improvised
bombers
lifted
out
to
strafe
the
skilkans
on
the
ground
and
the
four
airtanks
moved
out
to
take
position
and
open
fire
with
their
helping
to
flush
king
firkked
regulars
and
auxiliaries
out
of
the
gullies
and
ruins
and
drive
them
south
along
the
mountain
away
from
where
the
ship
would
land
and
also
away
from
the
city
of
skilk
the
set
down
quickly
and
troops
and
artillery
began
to
be
unloaded
joining
in
the
fighting
it
was
five
hundred
miles
to
krink
three
hours
after
lifting
out
the
was
back
again
with
two
more
of
king
infantry
regiments
and
by
when
the
fourth
load
arrived
from
krink
the
fighting
was
entirely
on
the
eastern
bank
of
the
dry
hoork
river
this
last
contingent
of
reenforcements
was
landed
in
the
eastern
suburbs
of
skilk
and
began
fighting
their
way
into
the
city
from
the
rear
it
was
evident
however
that
the
pacification
of
skilk
would
not
be
accomplished
as
rapidly
as
von
schlichten
wished
street
fighting
against
a
determined
enemy
is
notoriously
slow
work
and
he
decided
to
risk
the
in
an
attack
against
the
palace
itself
and
over
the
objections
of
paula
quinton
jules
keaveney
and
barney
mordkovitz
to
lead
the
attack
in
person
inside
the
city
he
found
that
the
zirk
cavalry
from
krink
had
thrust
up
one
of
the
broader
streets
to
within
a
thousand
yards
of
the
palace
and
supported
by
infantry
contragravity
and
a
couple
of
airtanks
were
pounding
and
hacking
at
a
mass
of
skilkans
whose
uniform
lack
of
costume
prevented
distinguishing
between
soldiery
and
townsfolk
very
few
of
these
he
observed
seemed
to
be
using
firearms
with
his
glasses
he
could
see
them
shooting
with
long
northern
and
a
few
takkad
sea
crossbows
either
weapon
would
shoot
clear
through
a
terran
or
through
an
ulleran
at
fifty
yards
but
at
over
two
hundred
they
were
almost
harmless
there
were
a
few
fires
still
burning
from
the
bombardment
of
the
night
before
ulleran
and
particularly
north
ulleran
cities
did
not
burn
well
and
the
blaze
which
had
consumed
the
bulk
of
firkked
stock
of
thermoconcentrate
fuel
had
long
ago
burned
out
leaving
an
area
of
six
or
eight
blocks
blackened
and
lifeless
the
ship
let
down
while
the
six
which
had
accompanied
her
buzzed
the
palace
roof
strafing
it
to
keep
it
clear
and
the
kragans
aboard
fired
with
their
rifles
she
came
to
rest
on
weight
reduction
and
even
before
the
gangplanks
were
run
out
the
kragans
were
dropping
to
the
flat
roof
running
to
stairhead
penthouses
and
tossing
grenades
into
them
the
taking
of
the
palace
was
a
gruesome
business
knowing
exactly
how
much
mercy
they
would
have
shown
had
they
been
storming
the
residency
firkked
soldiers
and
courtiers
fought
desperately
and
had
to
be
exterminated
floor
by
floor
room
by
room
hallway
by
hallway
there
was
some
attempt
at
escape
from
the
ground
floor
as
von
schlichten
and
his
kragans
fought
their
way
down
from
above
but
the
and
her
escort
of
and
airjeeps
bombed
and
and
rocketed
the
fugitives
from
above
and
the
loyal
zirk
cavalry
bursting
through
the
mob
came
up
shooting
and
lancing
by
this
time
an
aircar
fitted
with
a
was
circling
overhead
while
a
loyal
of
the
sixth
shouted
offers
of
quarter
and
orders
to
the
troops
to
spare
any
who
surrendered
driving
down
from
above
von
schlichten
and
his
kragans
slithered
over
floors
increasingly
greasy
with
yellow
ulleran
blood
he
had
picked
up
a
broadsword
at
the
foot
of
the
first
stairway
down
a
little
later
he
tossed
it
aside
in
favor
of
another
better
balanced
and
with
a
better
guard
there
was
a
furious
battle
at
the
doorways
of
the
throne
room
finally
climbing
over
the
bodies
of
their
own
dead
and
the
enemy
they
were
inside
here
there
was
no
question
of
quarter
whatever
at
least
as
long
as
firkked
lived
north
ulleran
nobles
did
not
surrender
under
the
eyes
of
their
king
and
north
ulleran
kings
did
not
surrender
their
thrones
alive
there
was
also
a
tradition
of
which
von
schlichten
was
mindful
that
a
king
must
only
be
killed
by
his
conqueror
in
personal
combat
with
steel
with
a
wedge
of
kragan
bayonets
around
him
and
the
broadsword
in
his
hand
he
fought
his
way
to
the
throne
where
firkked
waited
a
sword
in
one
of
his
upper
hands
his
spear
of
state
in
the
other
and
a
dagger
in
each
lower
hand
with
his
left
hand
von
schlichten
detached
the
bayonet
from
the
rifle
of
one
of
his
followers
and
went
forward
trying
not
to
think
of
the
absurdity
of
a
man
of
the
sixth
century
the
representative
of
a
civilized
chartered
company
dueling
to
the
death
with
swords
with
a
barbarian
king
for
a
throne
he
had
promised
to
another
barbarian
or
of
what
could
happen
on
uller
if
he
allowed
this
monstrosity
to
kill
him
it
was
not
as
bad
as
it
looked
however
the
ornate
spear
of
state
in
spite
of
its
long
blade
was
not
an
especially
good
at
least
for
one
hand
and
firkked
seemed
confused
by
the
very
abundance
of
his
armament
after
a
few
slashes
and
jabs
von
schlichten
knocked
the
unwieldy
thing
from
his
opponent
hand
this
raised
a
fearful
ululation
from
the
skilkan
nobility
who
had
stopped
fighting
to
watch
the
duel
evidently
it
was
the
very
worst
sort
of
a
bad
omen
firkked
seemingly
relieved
to
be
disencumbered
of
the
thing
caught
his
sword
in
both
hands
and
aimed
a
roundhouse
swing
at
von
schlichten
head
von
schlichten
dodged
crippled
one
of
firkked
lower
hands
with
a
quick
slash
and
lunged
at
the
royal
belly
firkked
used
his
remaining
dagger
to
parry
backed
a
step
closer
to
his
throne
and
took
another
swing
with
his
sword
which
von
schlichten
parried
on
the
bayonet
in
his
left
hand
then
backing
he
slashed
at
the
inside
of
firkked
leg
with
the
firkked
unable
to
support
the
weight
of
his
body
on
one
leg
stumbled
von
schlichten
ran
him
neatly
through
the
breast
with
his
sword
and
through
the
throat
with
the
bayonet
there
was
silence
in
the
throne
room
for
an
instant
and
then
with
a
horrible
collective
shriek
the
skilkans
threw
down
their
weapons
one
of
von
schlichten
kragans
slung
his
rifle
and
picked
up
the
spear
of
state
with
all
four
hands
taking
his
post
ceremoniously
behind
the
victor
a
couple
of
others
dragged
the
body
of
firkked
to
the
edge
of
the
dais
and
one
of
them
drew
his
and
beheaded
it
at
von
schlichten
was
on
the
roof
of
the
palace
holding
the
spear
of
state
with
firkked
head
impaled
on
the
point
while
a
terran
technician
aimed
an
recorder
this
he
said
with
the
in
his
mouth
is
king
firkked
spear
of
state
and
here
upon
it
is
king
firkked
head
two
days
ago
firkked
was
at
peace
with
the
company
and
firkked
was
king
in
skilk
if
he
had
not
dared
raise
his
feeble
hand
against
the
might
of
the
uller
company
he
would
still
be
alive
and
his
spear
would
still
be
borne
behind
him
so
must
all
those
who
rise
against
the
company
perish
cut
the
camera
stopped
a
kragan
came
forward
and
took
the
spear
of
state
with
its
grisly
burden
carrying
it
to
a
nearby
wall
and
leaning
it
up
like
a
piece
of
stage
property
no
longer
required
for
this
scene
but
needed
for
the
next
von
schlichten
took
out
his
wiped
and
pouched
it
and
took
his
cigarette
case
from
his
pocket
well
this
is
the
limit
paula
quinton
who
had
come
up
during
the
filming
of
the
scene
exploded
i
thought
you
had
to
kill
him
yourself
in
order
to
encourage
your
soldiers
i
did
think
you
wanted
to
make
a
movie
of
it
to
show
your
friends
i
through
you
can
find
yourself
a
new
adjutant
von
schlichten
tapped
the
cigarette
on
the
case
and
stared
at
her
through
his
monocle
you
ca
resign
he
told
her
resignations
of
officers
are
not
being
accepted
until
the
end
of
hostilities
in
any
case
i
care
to
have
you
go
you
the
best
adjutant
hideyoshi
not
excepted
i
ever
had
sit
down
colonel
he
lit
the
cigarette
your
education
still
needs
a
little
filling
in
at
grank
we
have
two
ships
one
is
the
sister
ship
of
the
the
other
is
the
cruiser
the
only
real
warship
on
uller
with
a
main
battery
of
four
guns
how
king
yoorkerk
was
able
to
get
control
of
those
ships
i
do
know
but
there
will
be
a
board
of
inquiry
and
maybe
a
couple
of
when
things
get
stabilized
to
a
point
where
we
can
afford
such
luxuries
as
it
is
we
need
those
ships
desperately
and
as
soon
as
he
gets
in
i
sending
hideyoshi
to
grank
with
the
and
a
load
of
kragan
rifles
to
pry
them
loose
the
of
which
this
is
the
last
scene
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
crowbars
he
going
to
use
oh
i
get
it
her
eyes
widened
with
pleasure
at
having
finally
caught
on
she
accepted
the
cigarette
and
the
light
von
schlichten
offered
good
old
yes
a
little
idea
i
adapted
from
my
nazi
ancestors
of
four
hundred
and
fifty
years
ago
hideyoshi
going
to
treat
king
yoorkerk
to
a
want
to
bet
he
wo
loosen
up
and
release
and
and
unblockade
the
grank
residency
after
he
sees
that
shot
of
firkked
head
leering
at
him
off
the
point
of
that
overgrown
asagai
as
i
said
that
only
the
last
scene
too
been
having
scenes
shot
all
through
this
fight
some
of
them
are
really
horrifying
but
why
did
you
have
to
fight
firkked
yourself
she
asked
you
took
an
awful
chance
with
two
hands
to
his
four
not
so
awful
remember
what
i
told
you
about
the
physical
limitations
of
ullerans
but
i
had
to
kill
him
myself
with
a
sword
according
to
local
custom
that
makes
me
king
of
skilk
why
your
majesty
she
rose
and
curtsied
mockingly
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
make
jonkvank
king
of
skilk
he
shook
his
head
just
viceroy
he
corrected
i
handing
the
spear
of
state
down
to
him
not
up
to
him
he
reign
as
my
vassal
and
consequently
as
vassal
of
the
company
and
before
long
he
be
much
more
at
krink
either
that
take
a
little
longer
have
to
be
military
missions
and
economic
missions
and
and
all
the
rest
of
it
first
but
he
on
the
way
to
becoming
a
half
an
hour
later
a
large
and
excessively
ornate
specially
built
at
the
konkrook
shipyards
for
king
jonkvank
was
sighted
coming
over
the
mountain
from
the
east
an
escort
of
was
sent
to
meet
it
and
a
battalion
of
kragans
and
the
survivors
of
firkked
court
were
drawn
up
on
the
palace
roof
his
majesty
jonkvank
king
of
krink
the
former
herald
of
king
firkked
court
now
herald
to
king
carlos
von
schlichten
shouted
banging
on
a
brass
shield
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
as
jonkvank
descended
from
his
launch
attended
by
a
group
of
his
nobles
and
his
spear
of
state
with
hideyoshi
and
francis
shapiro
shepherding
them
as
the
guests
advanced
across
the
roof
the
herald
banged
again
on
his
shield
his
majesty
carlos
von
schlichten
which
came
out
more
or
less
as
karlok
vonk
zlikdenk
king
by
right
of
combat
of
skilk
von
schlichten
advanced
to
meet
his
his
own
spear
of
state
with
firkked
head
still
grinning
from
it
two
paces
behind
him
jonkvank
stopped
his
face
contorted
with
saurian
rage
what
is
this
he
demanded
you
told
me
that
i
could
be
king
of
skilk
is
this
how
a
terran
keeps
his
word
a
terran
word
is
always
good
jonkvank
von
schlichten
replied
omitting
the
titles
as
was
proper
in
one
sovereign
addressing
another
my
word
was
that
you
should
reign
in
skilk
and
my
word
stands
but
these
things
must
be
done
decently
according
to
custom
and
law
i
killed
firkked
in
single
combat
had
i
not
done
so
the
spear
of
skilk
would
have
been
left
lying
for
any
of
the
young
of
firkked
to
pick
up
is
that
not
the
law
jonkvank
nodded
grudgingly
it
is
the
law
he
admitted
good
now
since
i
killed
firkked
in
lawful
manner
his
spear
is
mine
and
what
is
mine
i
can
give
as
i
please
i
now
give
you
the
spear
of
skilk
to
carry
in
my
name
as
i
promised
the
kragan
who
was
carrying
the
ceremonial
weapon
tossed
the
head
of
firkked
from
the
point
another
kragan
kicked
it
aside
and
advanced
to
wipe
the
with
a
rag
von
schlichten
took
the
spear
and
gave
it
to
jonkvank
this
is
not
good
one
of
the
skilkan
nobles
protested
he
had
a
better
right
than
any
of
the
others
to
protest
he
had
a
few
hours
before
ridden
in
at
the
head
of
a
company
of
his
retainers
to
swear
loyalty
to
the
company
that
you
should
rule
over
us
yes
you
killed
firkked
in
single
combat
and
you
are
the
soldier
of
the
company
which
is
mighty
as
all
here
have
seen
but
that
this
foreigner
be
given
the
spear
of
skilk
that
is
not
good
some
of
the
others
emboldened
by
his
example
were
jabbering
agreement
listen
all
of
you
von
schlichten
shouted
here
is
no
question
of
krink
ruling
over
skilk
does
it
matter
who
holds
the
spear
of
skilk
when
he
does
so
in
my
name
and
king
jonkvank
will
be
no
foreigner
he
will
come
and
live
among
you
and
later
he
will
travel
back
and
forth
between
krink
and
skilk
and
he
will
leave
the
spear
of
krink
in
krink
and
the
spear
of
skilk
in
skilk
and
in
skilk
he
will
be
a
skilkan
that
seemed
to
satisfy
everybody
except
jonkvank
and
he
had
wit
enough
not
to
make
an
issue
of
it
he
even
had
the
spear
of
krink
carried
back
aboard
his
launch
out
of
sight
and
when
he
accompanied
von
schlichten
an
hour
later
to
see
hideyoshi
off
for
grank
he
had
the
spear
of
skilk
carried
behind
him
when
he
was
alone
with
von
schlichten
in
the
room
that
had
been
king
firkked
bedchamber
however
he
exploded
what
is
all
this
foolishness
which
you
promised
these
people
in
my
name
and
which
i
must
now
carry
out
that
i
am
to
leave
the
spear
of
skilk
in
skilk
and
the
spear
of
krink
in
krink
and
come
here
to
live
you
wish
to
hold
skilk
von
schlichten
asked
i
intend
to
hold
skilk
to
begin
with
there
shall
be
a
great
killing
here
a
very
great
killing
of
all
those
who
advised
that
fool
of
a
firkked
to
start
this
business
of
those
who
gave
shelter
to
the
false
prophet
rakkeed
when
he
was
here
of
the
faithless
priests
who
gave
ear
to
his
abominable
heresies
and
allowed
him
to
spew
out
his
blasphemies
in
the
temples
of
those
who
sent
spies
to
krink
to
corrupt
and
pervert
my
soldiers
and
nobles
of
those
who
all
that
is
as
it
should
be
von
schlichten
agreed
except
that
it
must
be
done
quickly
and
all
at
once
before
the
memories
of
these
crimes
fade
from
the
minds
of
the
people
and
great
care
must
be
taken
to
kill
only
those
who
can
be
proven
to
be
guilty
of
something
thus
it
will
be
said
that
the
justice
of
king
jonkvank
is
terrible
to
evildoers
but
a
protection
and
a
shield
to
those
who
keep
the
peace
and
obey
the
laws
thus
you
will
gain
the
name
of
being
a
wise
and
just
king
and
when
the
priests
are
to
be
killed
it
should
be
done
under
the
direction
of
those
other
priests
who
were
faithful
to
the
gods
and
whom
king
firkked
drove
out
of
their
temples
and
it
must
be
done
in
the
name
of
the
gods
thus
will
you
be
esteemed
a
pious
and
not
an
impious
king
as
to
why
you
must
be
a
skilkan
in
skilk
you
heard
the
words
of
flurknurk
and
how
the
others
agreed
with
him
it
must
not
be
allowed
to
seem
that
the
city
has
come
under
foreign
rule
and
you
must
not
change
the
laws
unless
the
people
petition
you
to
do
so
nor
must
you
increase
the
taxes
and
you
must
not
confiscate
the
estates
of
those
who
are
put
to
death
for
the
death
of
parents
is
always
forgiven
before
the
loss
of
patrimonies
and
you
should
select
certain
skilkan
nobles
and
become
the
father
of
their
young
and
above
all
you
must
leave
none
of
the
young
of
firkked
alive
to
raise
rebellion
against
you
later
jonkvank
nodded
deeply
impressed
by
the
gods
karlok
vonk
zlikdenk
this
is
wisdom
now
it
is
to
be
seen
why
the
likes
of
firkked
can
not
prevail
against
you
or
against
the
company
as
long
as
you
are
the
company
upper
honesty
tempted
von
schlichten
for
a
moment
to
disclaim
originality
for
the
principles
he
had
just
enunciated
even
at
the
price
of
trying
to
pronounce
the
name
of
niccolo
machiavelli
with
a
on
second
thought
however
considerations
of
policy
restrained
him
if
jonkvank
ever
heard
of
nothing
would
satisfy
him
short
of
an
ulleran
translation
and
von
schlichten
would
have
been
just
about
as
happy
over
an
ulleran
translation
of
a
complete
set
of

got
two

of

from

opened
one
for
paula
quinton

one
for
himself
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
these
geeks
she
was
using
the
nasty
and
derogatory
word
unconsciously
and
by
custom
now
after
this
is
all
over
we
ca
just
tell
them
well
played
nice
game
was
it
and
go
back
to
where
we
were
wednesday
evening
no
we
ca
there
going
to
have
to
be
a
terran
seizure
of
political
power
in
every
part
of
this
planet
that
we
occupy
and
as
soon
as
we
consolidated
around
and
north
of
takkad
sea
we
going
to
have
to
move
in
elsewhere
he
replied
keegark
konkrook
and
the
free
cities
of
course
will
be
relatively
easy
they
in
arms
against
us
now
and
we
can
take
them
over
by
force
we
had
to
make
that
deal
with
jonkvank
or
rather
i
did
so
that
will
be
a
slower
process
but
we
get
it
done
in
time
if
i
know
that
pair
as
well
as
i
think
i
do
jonkvank
and
yoorkerk
will
give
us
plenty
of
pretexts
before
long
then
we
can
start
giving
them
government
by
law
instead
of
by
royal
decree
and
real
courts
of
justice
put
an
end
to
the
system
and
to
these
arbitrary
mass
arrests
and
imprisonments
that
are
nothing
but
by
the
geek
princes
on
their
own
people
and
gradually
abolish
serfdom
in
a
couple
of
centuries
this
planet
will
be
fit
to
admit
to
the
federation
like
odin
and
freya
well
wo
that
depend
a
lot
on
whom
the
company
sends
here
to
take
harrington
place
unless
i
much
mistaken
the
company
will
confirm
me
he
replied
administration
on
uller
is
going
to
be
a
military
matter
for
a
long
time
to
come
and
even
the
banking
cartel
and
the
mercantile
interests
in
the
company
are
going
to
realize
that
and
see
the
necessity
for
taking
political
control
the
federation
government
owns
a
bigger
interest
in
the
company
than
the
public
realizes
too
they
always
favored
it
and
just
to
make
sure
i
sending
hid
to
terra
on
the
next
ship
to
make
a
full
report
on
the
situation
you
think
it
be
cleared
up
by
then
the
of
is
due
in
from
niflheim
in
a
little
under
three
months
it
have
to
be
cleared
up
by
then
we
ca
keep
this
war
going
more
than
a
month
at
the
present
rate
and
yes
war
no
ammunition
she
asked
he
looked
at
her
in
pleased
surprise
your
education
has
been
progressing
at
that
he
said
you
know
a
lot
of
professional
officers
even
up
to
field
rank
in
the
combat
branches
seem
to
think
that
ammo
comes
down
miraculously
from
heaven
in
contragravity
lorries
every
time
they
pray
into
a
radio
for
it
it
does
it
has
to
be
produced
as
fast
as
it
expended
and
we
have
been
doing
that
so
we
have
to
lick
these
geeks
before
it
runs
out
because
we
ca
lick
them
with
gunbutts
and
bayonets
well
how
about
nuclear
weapons
paula
asked
i
hate
to
suggest
it
i
know
what
they
did
on
mimir
and
fenris
and
midgard
and
what
they
did
on
terra
during
the
first
century
but
it
may
be
our
only
chance
he
finished
his
beer
and
shoved
the
bottle
into
the
then
got
out
his
cigarettes
i
hate
to
have
to
make
a
decision
like
that
paula
he
told
her
the
military
use
of
nuclear
energy
is
the
last
well
the
thing
i
want
to
see
on
uller
fortunately
or
unfortunately
it
a
decision
i
wo
have
to
make
there
is
a
single
nuclear
bomb
on
the
planet
the
company
always
refused
to
allow
them
to
be
manufactured
or
stockpiled
here
i
do
think
there
be
any
criticism
of
your
making
them
now
general
and
there
certainly
plenty
of
plutonium
you
could
make
at
least
there
is
anybody
here
who
even
knows
how
to
make
one
most
of
our
nuclear
engineers
could
work
one
up
in
about
three
months
when
either
not
need
one
or
not
be
alive
gomes
who
came
in
on
the
two
weeks
ago
can
make
them
she
contradicted
he
built
at
least
a
dozen
of
them
on
niflheim
to
use
in
activating
volcanoes
and
bringing
lava
to
the
surface

bringing
his

to
the

of
his

paused
for
a
second
then
he
completed
the
operation
snapped
it
shut
and
put
it
away
when
did
all
this
happen
she
took
time
out
for
mental
arithmetic
even
a
spaceship
officer
had
to
do
that
when
a
question
of
interstellar
arose
about
days
ago
galactic
standard
they
put
off
the
first
shot
six
bombs
before
i
got
in
from
terra
i
saw
the
second
shot
a
day
or
so
before
i
left
niflheim
on
the
gomes
had
to
stay
over
till
the
to
put
off
the
third
shot
why
did
you
run
into
a
geek
named
gorkrink
while
you
were
on
nif
he
asked
her
and
what
sort
of
work
was
he
doing
gorkrink
i
do
seem
to
remember
oh
yes
he
was
helping
murillo
the
seismologist
his
year
was
up
after
the
second
shot
he
came
to
uller
on
the
murillo
was
sorry
to
lose
him
he
understood
lingua
terra
perfectly
murillo
could
talk
to
him
the
way
you
do
with
kankad
without
using
a
well
but
what
sort
of
work
helping
set
and
fire
the
good
lord
you
can
say
that
again
and
deal
in
allah
shiva
and
kali
von
schlichten
told
her
especially
kali
harry
see
if
you
can
get
some
more
speed
out
of
this
can
i
want
to
get
to
konkrook
while
still
there
it
was
full
dark
when
konkrook
came
in
view
beyond
the
east
konk
mountains
a
lurid
smear
on
the
underside
of
the
clouds
and
at
gongonk
island
and
at
the
company
farms
to
the
south
a
couple
of
bunches
of
searchlights
fingering
about
in
the
sky
when
von
schlichten
turned
on
the
outside
he
could
hear
the
distant
of
heavy
guns
and
the
crash
of
shells
and
bombs
keeping
the
car
high
enough
to
be
above
the
trajectories
of
incoming
shells
harry
quong
circled
over
the
city
while
hassan
bogdanoff
talked
to
gongonk
island
on
the
radio
the
city
was
in
a
bad
way
there
were
to
a
hundred
big
fires
going
and
a
new
one
started
in
a
rising
ball
of
thermoconcentrate
flame
while
they
watched
the
three
and
and
about
fifty
big
freight
lorries
converted
to
bombers
were
shuttling
back
and
forth
between
the
island
and
the
city
the
royal
palace
was
on
fire
from
end
to
end
and
the
entire
waterfront
and
industrial
district
were
in
flames
and
airjeeps
were
diving
in
to
shell
and
rocket
and
streets
and
buildings
he
saw
six
big
move
in
dignified
procession
to
unload
one
after
the
other
on
a
row
of
buildings
along
what
the
terrans
called
south
tenth
street
and
on
the
roofs
of
buildings
a
block
away
red
and
blue
flares
were
burning
and
he
could
see
figures
both
human
and
ulleran
setting
up
mortars
and
landing
on
the
top
stage
of
company
house
on
the
island
they
were
met
by
a
terran
whom
von
schlichten
had
seen
a
few
days
ago
bossing
at
the
spaceport
but
who
was
now
wearing
a
insignia
he
greeted
von
schlichten
with
a
salute
which
he
must
have
learned
from
some
movie
about
the
ancient
french
foreign
legion
von
schlichten
seriously
returned
it
in
kind
everybody
down
in
the
office
sir
he
said
your
office
that
is
king
kankad
here
with
us
too
he
accompanied
them
to
the
elevator
then
turned
to
a
telephone
when
von
schlichten
and
paula
reached
the
office
everybody
was
crowded
at
the
door
to
greet
them
themistocles
his
arm
in
a
sling
hans
meyerstein
the
johannesburg
lawyer
who
seemed
to
have
even
more
bantu
blood
than
the
morton
buhrmann
the
commercial
superintendent
laviola
the
fiscal
secretary
a
dozen
or
so
other
officers
and
civil
administrators
there
was
a
hubbub
of
greetings
and
he
was
pleased
to
detect
as
much
real
warmth
from
the
civil
administration
crowd
as
from
the
officers
well
i
glad
to
be
back
with
you
he
replied
generally
and
let
me
present
colonel
paula
quinton
my
new
adjutant
hid
on
duty
in
the
north
them
this
was
a
perfectly
splendid
piece
of
work
here
you
can
take
this
not
only
as
a
personal
congratulation
but
as
a
sort
of
unit
citation
for
the
whole
crowd
you
all
behaved
simply
above
praise
he
turned
to
king
kankad
who
was
wearing
a
pair
of
automatics
in
for
his
upper
hands
and
another
pair
in
belt
holsters
for
his
lower
and
what
i
said
for
anybody
else
goes
double
for
you
kankad
he
added
clapping
the
kragan
on
the
shoulder
all
he
did
was
save
the
lot
of
us
said
we
were
hanging
on
by
our
fingernails
here
till
his
people
started
coming
in
and
then
after
you
sent
the
where
is
the
by
the
way
i
did
see
her
when
i
came
in
based
on
kankad
flying
bombardment
against
keegark
and
keeping
an
eye
out
for
those
ships
prinsloo
caught
the
in
the
docks
there
and
smashed
her
but
the
got
away
and
we
been
able
to
locate
the
paul
either
they
probably
both
on
the
eastern
shore
gathering
up
reenforcements
for
orgzild
said
our
ability
to
move
troops
rapidly
is
what
kept
us
on
top
this
long
and
orgzild
had
plenty
of
time
to
realize
it
von
schlichten
said
when
we
get
down
here
i
going
to
send
her
out
with
a
screen
of
light
to
find
those
ships
and
get
rid
of
them
how
hid
been
making
out
at
grank
by
the
way
i
have
my
on
coming
down
that
touched
off
another
hubbub
have
you
heard
general
oh
my
god
this
is
simply
out
of
this
continuum
well
tell
him
somebody
no
get
hid
on
the
screen
it
his
story
somebody
busied
himself
at
the
switchboard
the
rest
of
them
sat
down
at
the
long
laviola
and
meyerstein
and
buhrmann
were
especially
obsequious
in
seating
von
schlichten
in
sid
old
chair
and
in
getting
a
chair
for
paula
quinton
after
a
while
the
jumbled
colors
on
the
big
screen
resolved
themselves
into
an
image
of
hideyoshi
grinning
like
a
beside
an
empty
well
what
happened
von
schlichten
asked
after
they
had
exchanged
greetings
how
did
yoorkerk
like
the
movies
and
did
you
get
the
and
the
loose
yoorkerk
was
deeply
impressed
replied
his
story
is
that
he
is
and
always
was
the
true
and
friend
of
the
company
he
acted
to
prevent
quote
certain
disloyal
elements
unquote
from
harming
the
people
and
property
of
the
company
on
the
way
to
konkrook
i
holding
here
and
at
skilk
where
do
you
want
them
sent
leave
at
skilk
for
the
time
being
tell
the
company
great
and
good
friend
king
yoorkerk
that
the
company
expects
him
to
contribute
some
soldiers
for
the
campaign
here
and
against
keegark
when
that
starts
be
sure
you
get
the
and
regiments
he
has
and
get
them
down
here
as
soon
as
possible
do
send
any
of
your
kragans
or
karamessinis
troops
here
though
hold
them
in
grank
till
we
make
sure
of
the
quality
of
yoorkerk
friendship
well
general
i
think
we
can
be
pretty
sure
now
you
see
he
turned
rakkeed
the
prophet
over
to
me
von
schlichten
felt
his
monocle
starting
to
slip
and
took
a
firmer
grip
on
it
who
pay
me
them
he
did
drop
it
hideyoshi
said
why
rakkeed
the
prophet
yoorkerk
was
holding
our
ships
and
our
people
in
case
we
lost
he
was
also
holding
rakkeed
at
the
palace
in
case
we
won
of
course
rakkeed
thought
he
was
an
honored
guest
right
up
till
yoorkerk
guards
dragged
him
in
and
turned
him
over
to
us
that
geek
von
schlichten
said
is
too
smart
for
his
own
good
some
of
these
days
he
going
to
play
both
ends
against
the
middle
and
both
ends
fold
in
on
him
and
smash
him
a
suspicion
occurred
to
him
you
sure
this
is
rakkeed
it
would
be
just
like
yoorkerk
to
try
to
sell
us
a
ringer
shook
his
head
solemnly
i
thought
of
that
right
away
this
is
the
real
article
karamessinis
constabulary
and
intelligence
officers
certified
him
for
me
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
send
him
down
to
konkrook
von
schlichten
shook
his
head
get
the
priests
of
the
locally
venerated
gods
to
put
him
on
trial
for
blasphemy
heresy
impersonating
a
prophet
practicing
witchcraft
without
a
license
or
any
other
ecclesiastical
crimes
you
or
they
can
think
of
then
after
he
been
given
a
scrupulously
fair
trial
have
the
soldiers
of
king
yoorkerk
behead
him
and
stick
his
head
up
over
a
big
sign
in
all
native
languages
the
false
prophet
and
have
made
of
the
whole
business
trial
and
execution
and
be
sure
that
the
priests
and
yoorkerk
officers
are
in
the
foreground
and
our
people
stay
out
of
the
pictures
soap
and
towels
for
general
pontius
von
pilate
paula
quinton
called
out
that
an
idea
i
was
wondering
what
to
give
yoorkerk
as
a
testimonial
present
hideyoshi
said
a
nice
silver
set
quite
appropriate
von
schlichten
approved
well
you
did
a
job
i
want
you
back
with
us
as
soon
as
possible
incidentally
you
now
a
but
not
till
the
situation
at
is
stabilized
and
eventually
you
probably
have
to
set
up
permanent
headquarters
in
the
north
after
hideyoshi
had
thanked
him
and
signed
off
and
the
screen
was
dark
again
he
turned
to
the
others
well
gentlemen
i
do
think
we
need
worry
too
much
about
the
north
for
the
next
few
days
how
long
do
you
estimate
this
operation
against
konkrook
going
to
take
to
complete
pacification
them
how
complete
is
complete
pacification
general
themistocles
wanted
to
know
if
you
mean
to
the
end
of
organized
resistance
by
larger
than
groups
i
say
three
days
give
or
take
twelve
hours
of
course
there
be
small
groups
holding
out
for
a
couple
of
weeks
particularly
in
the
farming
country
and
back
in
the
forest
we
can
forget
them
that
stuff
we
need
to
keep
some
kind
of
an
occupation
force
here
for
some
time
they
can
deal
with
that
we
have
to
get
to
work
on
keegark
as
soon
as
possible
after
we
reduced
keegark
we
be
able
to
reorganize
for
a
campaign
against
the
free
cities
on
the
eastern
shore
begging
your
pardon
general
but
reduce
is
a
mild
word
for
what
we
ought
to
do
to
keegark
hans
meyerstein
said
we
ought
to
raze
that
city
as
flat
as
a
football
field
and
then
play
football
on
it
with
king
orgzild
head
any
special
reason
von
schlichten
asked
in
addition
to
the
massacre
that
is
i
should
say
so
general
themistocles
backed
meyerstein
up
bob
you
tell
him
colonel
robert
grinell
the
intelligence
officer
got
up
and
took
the
cigar
out
of
his
mouth
he
was
short
and
and
but
he
was
old
terran
federation
regular
army
well
general
we
been
finding
out
quite
a
bit
about
the
genesis
of
this
business
lately
he
said
from
up
north
it
probably
looked
like
an
show
that
how
it
was
supposed
to
look
but
the
whole
thing
was
hatched
at
keegark
by
king
orgzild
we
managed
to
capture
a
few
prominent
konkrookans
he
named
half
a
dozen
been
made
to
talk
and
a
number
of
others
have
come
in
voluntarily
and
furnished
information
orgzild
conceived
the
scheme
in
the
beginning
rakkeed
was
just
the
my
face
gets
the
color
of
the
company
trademark
every
time
i
think
that
the
whole
thing
was
planned
for
over
a
year
right
under
our
noses
even
to
the
signal
that
was
to
touch
the
whole
thing
off
the
poisoning
of
sid
harrington
and
our
announcement
of
his
death
von
schlichten
asked
you
figured
that
out
yourself
sir
well
that
was
it
grinell
went
on
to
elaborate
while
von
schlichten
tried
to
keep
the
impatience
out
of
his
face
beside
him
paula
quinton
was
fidgeting
too
she
was
thinking
as
he
was
of
what
king
orgzild
and
prince
gorkrink
were
doing
now
and
i
know
positively
that
the
order
for
the
poisoning
of
sid
harrington
came
from
the
keegarkan
embassy
here
and
was
passed
down
through
gurgurk
and
keeluk
to
this
geek
here
who
actually
put
the
poison
in
the
whiskey
yes
i
agree
that
keegark
should
be
wiped
out
and
i
like
to
have
an
immediate
estimate
on
the
time
it
take
to
build
a
nuclear
bomb
to
do
the
job
one
of
the
plutonium
fission
will
do
quite
well
everybody
turned
quickly
there
was
a
momentary
silence
and
then
colonel
evan
colbert
of
the
fourth
kragan
rifles
the
senior
officer
under
themistocles
found
his
voice
if
that
an
order
general
we
get
it
done
but
i
like
to
remind
you
first
of
the
company
policy
on
nuclear
weapons
on
this
planet
i
aware
of
that
policy
i
also
aware
of
the
reason
for
it
been
compelled
because
of
the
lack
of
natural
fuel
on
uller
to
set
up
nuclear
power
reactors
and
furnish
large
quantities
of
plutonium
to
the
geeks
to
fuel
them
the
company
does
want
the
natives
here
learning
of
the
possibility
of
using
nuclear
energy
for
destructive
purposes
well
gentlemen
that
a
dead
issue
they
learned
it
thanks
to
our
people
on
niflheim
and
unless
my
estimate
is
entirely
wrong
king
orgzild
already
has
at
least
one
plutonium
bomb
i
am
inclined
to
believe
that
he
had
at
least
one
such
bomb
probably
more
at
the
time
when
orders
were
sent
to
his
embassy
here
for
the
poisoning
of
harrington
with
that
he
selected
a
cigarette
from
his
case
offered
it
to
paula
and
snapped
his
lighter
she
had
hers
lit
and
he
was
puffing
on
his
own
when
the
others
finally
realized
what
he
had
told
them
that
impossible
somebody
down
the
table
shouted
as
though
that
would
make
it
so
another
one
of
the
civil
administration
crowd
almost
exactly
repeated
jules
keaveney
words
at
skilk
what
the
hell
was
intelligence
doing
sleeping
general
von
schlichten
colonel
grinell
took
oblique
cognizance
of
the
question
you
just
made
by
implication
a
most
grave
charge
against
my
department
if
you
not
mistaken
in
what
you
just
said
i
deserve
to
be
i
could
bring
charges
against
you
colonel
if
it
were
a
matter
i
belong
in
the
dock
with
you
von
schlichten
told
him
it
seems
though
that
a
piece
of
vital
information
was
possessed
by
those
who
were
unable
to
evaluate
it
and
until
this
afternoon
i
was
ignorant
of
its
existence
colonel
quinton
suppose
you
repeat
what
you
told
me
on
the
way
down
from
skilk
well
general
do
you
think
we
ought
to
have
gomes
do
that
paula
asked
after
all
he
constructed
those
bombs
on
niflheim
and
it
be
he
who
have
to
build
ours
that
right
he
looked
around
where
lourenço
gomes
the
nuclear
engineer
who
came
in
on
the
two
weeks
ago
send
out
for
him
and
get
him
in
here
at
once
there
was
another
awkward
silence
then
kent
pickering
the
chief
of
the
gongonk
island
cleared
his
throat
why
general
did
you
know
gomes
is
dead
he
was
killed
during
the
first
half
hour
of
the
uprising
xiii
a
bag
of
tricks
we
do
have
he
flinched
inwardly
and
tightened
his
on
the
edge
of
the
monocle
to
keep
from
flinching
physically
as
well
trying
to
freeze
out
of
his
face
the
consternation
he
felt
that
bad
kent
he
said
very
bad
i
been
counting
heavily
on
gomes
to
design
a
bomb
of
our
own
well
general
if
you
please
that
was
leslie
hargreaves
you
say
you
suspect
that
king
orgzild
has
developed
a
nuclear
bomb
if
that
true
it
a
horrible
danger
to
all
of
us
but
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
the
keegarkans
could
have
done
so
with
their
resources
and
at
their
technological
level
now
if
it
had
been
the
kragans
that
would
have
been
different
but
paula
you
better
carry
on
and
explain
what
you
told
me
and
add
anything
else
you
can
think
of
that
might
be
relevant
is
that
turned
on
then
turn
it
on
somebody
we
want
this
taped
paula
rose
and
began
talking
i
suppose
you
all
understand
what
conditions
are
on
niflheim
and
how
these
ulleran
native
workers
are
employed
however
i
better
begin
by
explaining
the
purpose
for
which
these
nuclear
bombs
were
designed
and
used
he
smiled
she
realized
that
he
needed
time
to
think
and
she
was
stalling
to
provide
it
he
drew
a
pencil
and
pad
toward
him
and
began
doodling
in
a
bored
manner
deliberately
closing
his
mind
to
what
she
was
saying
there
were
two
assumptions
he
considered
first
that
king
orgzild
already
possessed
a
nuclear
bomb
which
he
could
use
when
he
chose
and
second
that
in
the
absence
of
gomes
such
a
bomb
could
only
be
produced
on
gongonk
island
after
lengthy
experimental
work
if
both
of
these
assumptions
were
true
he
had
just
heard
the
of
every
terran
on
uller
the
first
he
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
the
reasons
for
making
it
were
too
good
he
dismissed
it
from
further
consideration
and
concentrated
on
the
second
what
known
as
a
bomb
the
first
type
of
developed
paula
was
saying
really
it
a
technological
antique
but
it
was
good
enough
for
the
purpose
and
gomes
could
build
it
with
locally
available
materials
that
was
the
crux
of
it
the
plutonium
bomb
from
a
military
standpoint
was
as
obsolete
as
the
flintlock
musket
had
been
at
the
time
of
the
second
world
war
he
reviewed
quickly
the
history
of
since
the
beginning
of
the
atomic
era
the
emphasis
since
the
end
of
the
second
world
war
had
all
been
on
nuclear
weapons
and
there
had
been
the
itself
obsolescent
and
the
bomb
and
the
subneutron
bomb
and
the
bomb
and
the
bomb
and
then
the
end
of
civilization
in
the
northern
hemisphere
and
the
rise
of
the
new
civilization
in
south
america
and
south
africa
and
australia
today
the
and
artillery
his
troops
were
using
were
merely
slight
refinements
on
the
weapons
of
the
first
century
and
all
the
modern
nuclear
weapons
used
by
the
terran
federation
were
produced
at
the
space
navy
base
on
mars
by
a
small
force
of
experts
whose
skills
were
almost
as
closed
to
the
general
scientific
and
technical
world
as
the
secrets
of
a
medieval
guild
the
old
was
an
historical
curiosity
and
there
was
nobody
on
uller
who
had
more
than
a
knowledge
of
the
intricate
technology
of
modern
nuclear
weapons
there
were
plenty
of
good
engineers
on
gongonk
island
but
how
long
would
it
take
them
to
design
and
build
a
plutonium
bomb
also
has
a
good
understanding
of
lingua
terra
paula
was
saying
he
and
murillo
conversed
bilingually
just
as
i
heard
general
von
schlichten
and
king
kankad
talking
to
one
another
i
have
any
idea
whether
or
not
gorkrink
could
read
lingua
terra
or
if
so
what
papers
or
plans
he
might
have
seen
just
a
minute
paula
he
said
colonel
grinell
what
does
your
branch
have
on
this
gorkrink
he
the
son
of
king
orgzild
and
the
daughter
of
prince
jurnkonk
grinell
said
we
knew
he
signed
on
for
nif
two
years
ago
but
the
story
we
got
was
that
he
fallen
out
of
favor
at
court
and
had
been
exiled
i
can
see
now
that
that
was
planted
to
mislead
us
as
to
whether
or
not
he
can
read
lingua
terra
my
belief
is
that
he
can
we
know
that
he
can
understand
it
when
spoken
he
could
have
learned
to
read
at
one
of
those
schools
mohammed
ferriera
set
up
ten
or
fifteen
years
ago
and
gomes
and
murillo
and
livesey
left
papers
and
plans
lying
around
all
over
the
place
paula
added
if
he
went
to
niflheim
as
a
spy
he
could
have
copied
almost
anything
well
there
you
have
it
von
schlichten
said
when
gorkrink
found
out
that
plutonium
can
be
used
for
bombs
he
began
gathering
all
the
information
he
could
and
as
soon
as
he
got
home
he
turned
it
all
over
to
pappy
orgzild
that
still
does
mean
that
the
were
able
to
do
anything
with
it
hargreaves
argued
i
think
it
does
von
schlichten
differed
as
soon
as
orgzild
would
hear
about
the
possibility
of
making
a
plutonium
bomb
he
set
up
an
project
and
do
think
of
it
in
terms
of
the
old
first
century
manhattan
project
there
would
be
no
problem
of
producing
fissionables
we
been
scattering
refined
plutonium
over
this
planet
like
confetti
well
an
a
pretty
complicated
piece
of
mechanism
even
if
you
have
the
plans
for
it
kent
pickering
said
as
i
recall
there
have
to
be
several
subcritical
masses
of
plutonium
or
or
whatever
blown
together
by
shaped
charges
of
explosive
all
of
which
have
to
be
fired
simultaneously
that
would
mean
a
lot
of
electrical
fittings
that
i
ca
see
these
geeks
making
by
hand
i
can
paula
said
have
you
ever
seen
the
work
these
native
jewelers
do
and
did
you
tell
me
about
a
clockwork
thing
they
have
at
the
university
here
to
show
the
apparent
movements
of
the
sun
that
right
von
schlichten
said
and
what
they
could
make
they
could
have
bought
from
us
we
sold
them
a
lot
of
electrical
equipment
all
right
they
could
have
built
an
buhrmann
said
but
did
they
we
assume
they
tried
to
gorkrink
got
back
from
nif
on
the
canberra
three
months
ago
von
schlichten
said
if
orgzild
decided
to
build
an
he
would
give
the
signal
for
this
uprising
until
he
either
had
one
or
knew
he
could
make
one
and
he
would
give
up
trying
in
only
three
months
therefore
i
think
we
can
assume
that
he
succeeded
and
had
succeeded
at
the
time
he
sent
gorkrink
here
to
get
that
four
tons
of
plutonium
we
let
him
have
and
incidentally
to
tell
ghroghrank
to
pass
the
word
to
have
sid
harrington
poisoned
according
to
plan
then
why
did
he
just
use
it
on
us
at
the
start
of
the
uprising
meyerstein
wanted
to
know
why
should
he
getting
rid
of
us
is
only
the
first
step
in
plan
grinell
said
back
as
far
as
geek
history
goes
the
kings
of
keegark
have
been
trying
to
conquer
konkrook
and
the
free
cities
and
make
themselves
masters
of
the
whole
takkad
sea
area
let
konkrook
wipe
us
out
and
then
he
can
move
in
his
troops
and
take
konkrook
or
if
we
beat
off
the
geeks
here
as
we
seem
to
be
doing
he
can
bomb
us
out
and
then
move
in
on
konkrook
i
think
that
as
long
as
fighting
here
he
wait
the
more
damage
we
do
to
konkrook
the
easier
it
be
for
him
then
we
better
start
dragging
our
feet
on
the
konkrook
front
laviola
said
and
get
busy
trying
to
build
a
bomb
of
our
own
von
schlichten
looked
up
at
the
big
screen
on
which
the
battle
of
konkrook
was
being
projected
from
an
overhead
pickup
i
agree
on
the
second
half
of
it
von
schlichten
said
and
also
have
to
set
up
some
kind
of
system
against
bombers
from
keegark
and
as
soon
as
gets
here
we
have
to
send
her
out
to
hunt
down
and
destroy
those
two
freighters
the
and
the
and
we
have
to
arrange
for
protection
of
kankad
town
that
sure
to
be
another
of
orgzild
targets
as
to
the
action
against
konkrook
i
rely
on
your
advice
them
can
we
delay
the
fall
of
the
city
for
any
length
of
time
shook
his
head
when
we
divert
contragravity
to
work
the
ground
action
slow
up
a
little
of
course
but
the
geeks
are
about
knocked
out
now
the
hell
with
it
then
i
doubt
if
we
be
able
to
buy
much
time
from
orgzild
by
delaying
victory
in
the
city
and
we
probably
need
the
troops
as
workers
over
here
he
turned
to
pickering
pickering
what
sort
of
a
crew
can
you
scrape
together
to
design
a
bomb
for
us
he
asked
well
there
martirano
and
sternberg
and
howard
and
piet
van
reenen
and
he
nodded
to
himself
i
can
get
six
or
eight
of
them
in
here
in
about
twenty
minutes
i
have
a
project
set
up
and
working
in
a
couple
of
hours
there
has
to
be
somebody
qualified
on
duty
at
the
plant
all
the
time
of
course
but
all
right
call
them
in
i
want
the
bomb
finished
by
yesterday
afternoon
and
everybody
with
you
and
you
yourself
had
better
revert
to
civilian
status
this
is
something
you
can
do
by
the
numbers
and
i
do
want
anybody
who
does
know
what
it
all
about
pulling
rank
on
your
outfit
go
ahead
call
in
your
gang
and
let
me
know
what
you
be
able
to
do
as
soon
as
possible
he
turned
to
hargreaves
les
you
have
charge
of
flying
the
security
patrols
and
doing
anything
else
you
can
to
keep
orgzild
from
bombing
us
before
we
can
bomb
him
you
have
priority
on
everything
second
only
to
pickering
hargreaves
nodded
as
you
say
general
we
have
to
protect
kankad
as
well
as
this
place
it
about
five
hundred
miles
from
here
to
kankad
and
miles
from
kankad
to
keegark
he
stopped
talking
to
von
schlichten
and
began
muttering
to
himself
running
over
the
names
of
ships
and
the
speeds
and
capacities
of
airboats
and
distances
in
about
five
minutes
he
would
have
a
programme
worked
out
in
the
meantime
von
schlichten
could
only
be
patient
and
contain
himself
he
looked
along
the
table
and
caught
sight
of
a
man
in
a
green
shirt
with
a
colonel
three
concentric
circles
marked
on
the
shoulders
in
emmett
pearson
the
communications
chief
emmett
he
said
those
orbiters
you
have
strung
around
this
planet
two
thousand
miles
out
for
telecast
rebroadcast
stations
how
much
of
a
crew
could
be
put
on
one
of
them
pearson
laughed
crew
of
what
general
white
mice
or
trained
cockroaches
there
is
room
inside
one
of
those
things
for
anything
bigger
to
move
around
well
i
know
they
automatic
but
how
do
you
service
them
from
the
outside
they
only
ten
feet
through
by
about
twenty
in
length
with
a
ball
at
either
end
and
everything
in
sections
which
can
be
taken
out
our
goes
up
in
a
thing
like
a
small
spaceship
and
either
works
on
the
outside
in
spacesuits
or
puts
in
a
new
section
and
brings
the
unserviceable
one
down
here
to
the
shops
ah
and
what
sort
of
a
thing
is
this
small
spaceship
now
a
thing
like
a
pair
of
lorries
with
airlocks
between
and
connected
at
the
middle
airtight
of
course
and
pressurized
and
insulated
like
a
spaceship
one
side
living
quarters
for
a
crew
sometimes
the
gang
out
for
as
long
as
a
week
at
a
time
and
the
other
side
a
workshop
that
sounded
interesting
with
contragravity
of
course
terms
like
and
were
of
purely
antiquarian
interest
how
long
he
asked
pearson
would
it
take
to
fit
that
vehicle
with
a
full
set
of
detection
instruments
radar
infrared
and
vision
heat
and
radiation
detectors
the
whole
works
and
spot
it
about
a
hundred
to
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
above
keegark
that
i
could
say
general
emmett
pearson
replied
it
have
to
be
a
shipyard
job
and
a
lot
of
that
stuff
clear
outside
my
department
ask
hargreaves
les
he
called
out
wake
up
les
just
a
second
general
hargreaves
scribbled
frantically
on
his
pad
now
he
said
raising
his
head
what
is
it
sir
emmett
here
has
a
spaceship
that
he
uses
to
service
those
orbital
stations
of
his
he
tell
you
what
like
i
want
it
fitted
with
every
sort
of
detection
device
that
can
be
crammed
into
or
onto
it
and
spotted
above
keegark
it
should
of
course
be
high
enough
to
cover
not
only
the
keegark
area
but
konkrook
kankad
and
the
lower
hoork
and
konk
yes
i
get
it
hargreaves
snatched
up
a
phone
punched
out
a
combination
and
began
talking
rapidly
into
it
in
a
low
voice
after
a
while
he
hung
up
all
right
pearson
colonel
pearson
i
mean
have
your
sent
around
to
the
shipyard
my
boys
fix
it
up
he
made
a
note
on
another
piece
of
paper
if
we
live
through
this
i
going
to
have
a
couple
of
ships
in
service
on
this
planet
now
general
i
have
a
tentative
setup
going
to
need
the
for
patrol
work
south
and
east
of
konkrook
and
the
and
to
the
north
and
northeast
based
on
kankad
we
keep
the
at
kankad
and
use
her
for
emergencies
and
we
have
patrols
of
light
contragravity
like
this
he
handed
a
map
with
and
markings
along
to
von
schlichten
red
are
blue
are
that
looks
all
right
von
schlichten
said
there
another
thing
though
we
want
to
cover
the
keegark
area
with
these
geeks
are
quite
well
aware
of
from
fissionables
but
they
accustomed
to
the
ordinary
reactors
which
are
either
very
lightly
shielded
or
unshielded
on
top
we
want
to
find
out
where
is
yes
general
as
soon
as
we
can
get
radiation
detectors
sent
out
to
kankad
we
have
a
couple
of
fast
aircars
fitted
with
them
for
that
job
we
have
detectors
at
our
laboratory
and
kankad
said
and
my
people
can
make
more
as
soon
as
you
want
them
he
thought
for
a
moment
perhaps
i
should
go
to
the
town
now
i
could
be
of
more
use
there
than
here
kent
pickering
who
had
been
talking
with
his
experts
at
a
table
apart
returned
we
set
up
a
programme
general
he
said
it
going
to
be
a
lot
harder
than
i
anticipated
none
of
us
seem
to
know
exactly
what
we
have
to
do
in
building
one
of
those
things
you
see
the
uranium
or
plutonium
been
obsolete
for
over
four
hundred
years
it
was
a
matter
long
after
its
obsolescence
because
it
had
been
rendered
any
the
less
deadly
by
being
superseded
there
was
that
that
the
christian
anarchist
party
put
together
at
buenos
aires
in
for
instance
and
then
after
it
was
declassified
it
had
been
so
far
superseded
that
it
was
of
only
antiquarian
interest
the
textbooks
dealt
with
it
only
in
general
terms
the
principles
of
course
are
part
of
basic
nuclear
science
the
secret
of
the
was
just
a
bag
of
engineering
tricks
that
we
do
have
and
which
we
will
have
to
rediscover
design
of
tampers
design
of
the
charges
to
bring
subcritical
masses
together
detonating
mechanism
things
like
that
the
complete
data
on
even
the
old
hiroshima
and
nagasaki
types
is
still
in
existence
of
course
you
can
get
it
at
places
like
the
university
of
montevideo
library
or
jan
smuts
memorial
library
at
cape
town
but
we
do
have
it
here
we
detailing
a
couple
of
junior
technicians
to
make
a
search
of
the
library
here
on
gongonk
island
but
we
not
optimistic
we
just
ca
afford
to
pass
up
any
chance
even
when
it
approaches
von
schlichten
nodded
that
about
what
i
expected
he
said
i
suppose
gomes
got
his
data
out
of
one
of
the
dustier
at
jan
smuts
or
montevideo
in
the
first
place
well
i
still
want
that
bomb
finished
by
yesterday
afternoon
but
since
impractical
you
have
to
take
a
little
but
as
little
as
possible
longer
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
publicity
on
this
howlett
the
personnel
man
asked
we
do
want
this
getting
out
in
garbled
form
though
how
it
could
be
made
worse
by
garbling
i
guess
and
having
the
troops
watching
the
sky
over
their
shoulders
and
going
into
a
panic
as
soon
as
they
saw
something
they
understand
no
we
do
i
seen
a
couple
of
von
schlichten
said
there
ca
be
anything
much
worse
than
a
panic
i
think
the
terrans
ought
to
be
told
the
worst
hargreaves
said
and
told
that
our
only
hope
is
to
get
a
bomb
of
our
own
built
and
dropped
first
as
to
the
kragans
what
do
you
think
king
kankad
tell
them
that
we
are
building
a
bomb
to
destroy
keegark
that
we
are
running
short
of
ammunition
and
that
it
is
our
only
hope
of
finishing
the
war
before
the
ammunition
is
gone
kankad
said
tell
them
something
of
what
sort
of
a
bomb
it
is
but
do
not
tell
them
that
king
orgzild
already
has
such
a
bomb
old
kankad
who
made
me
out
of
himself
told
me
about
how
our
people
fled
in
panic
from
the
weapons
of
the
terrans
when
your
people
and
mine
were
still
enemies
this
thing
is
to
the
weapons
they
faced
then
as
those
weapons
were
to
the
old
kragans
spears
and
bows
and
when
the
geeks
from
grank
come
here
tell
them
that
we
are
winning
and
that
if
they
fight
well
they
can
share
the
loot
of
konkrook
and
keegark
von
schlichten
looked
up
at
the
big
screen
already
themistocles
had
ordered
the
channel
battery
to
reduce
fire
the
big
guns
were
firing
singly
in
salvos
there
was
less
bombing
too
contragravity
was
being
drawn
out
of
the
battle
well
we
all
have
things
to
do
he
said
and
i
think
discussed
everything
there
is
to
discuss
anybody
think
of
anything
we
forgotten
then
we
adjourned
he
and
paula
quinton
took
the
elevator
to
the
roof
and
sat
side
by
side
silently
watching
the
conflagration
that
was
raging
across
the
channel
and
the
nearer
flashes
of
the
big
guns
along
the
city
side
wednesday
night
i
thought
we
were
all
cooked
paula
told
him
cleaning
up
the
north
in
two
days
seemed
like
an
impossibility
too
maybe
you
do
it
again
if
i
pull
this
one
out
of
the
fire
i
wo
be
a
general
i
be
a
magician
he
said
pickering
be
a
magician
i
mean
he
the
boy
who
save
our
bacon
if
it
saveable
he
looked
somberly
across
the
water
let
not
kid
ourselves
we
just
kicking
and
biting
at
the
guards
on
the
way
up
the
well
why
stop
till
the
trap
sprung
she
asked
what
happen
to
these
people
on
this
planet
after
we
atomized
that
i
do
want
to
think
about
kankad
town
will
get
the
second
bomb
orgzild
wo
dare
leave
the
kragans
after
he
wiped
us
out
yoorkerk
and
jonkvank
in
the
north
will
turn
on
keaveney
and
shapiro
and
karamessinis
and
hid
and
wipe
them
out
and
when
the
next
ship
gets
in
here
and
they
find
out
what
happened
they
send
the
federation
space
navy
and
this
planet
get
it
worse
than
fenris
did
they
blast
anything
that
has
four
arms
and
a
face
like
a
lizard
half
a
dozen
aircars
lifted
suddenly
from
the
airport
and
streaked
away
to
the
northeast
as
they
went
past
in
the
light
of
the
burning
city
he
could
see
that
at
least
three
of
them
had
multiple
on
top
in
a
matter
of
seconds
a
raced
after
them
and
a
second
which
had
been
over
konkrook
jettisoned
a
bomb
and
turned
away
to
follow
maybe
that
it
paula
said
well
if
it
is
we
wo
be
any
better
off
anywhere
else
than
here
he
told
her
let
stay
and
watch
after
what
seemed
like
a
long
time
however
a
twinkle
of
lights
showed
over
the
east
konk
mountains
they
were
the
flashes
of
explosions
some
were
magnesium
flares
and
some
were
the
lights
of
a
ship
that
from
grank
he
said
everybody
gets
a
good
mark
for
this
detection
stations
interceptors
if
that
had
been
it
there
have
been
a
good
chance
of
stopping
it
he
felt
better
than
he
had
since
pickering
had
told
him
that
lourenço
gomes
was
dead
it
a
good
thing
gorkrink
did
pick
up
any
dope
on
guided
missiles
while
he
was
at
it
as
long
as
they
have
to
deliver
it
with
contragravity
we
have
a
chance
they
rose
from
the
balustrade
where
they
had
been
sitting
and
for
the
first
time
he
discovered
that
he
had
had
his
left
arm
over
her
shoulder
and
that
she
had
had
her
right
hand
resting
on
the
point
of
his
right
hip
just
above
his
pistol
he
picked
up
the
folder
of
papers
she
had
been
carrying
and
put
her
into
the
elevator
ahead
of
him
and
it
was
only
when
they
parted
on
the
level
that
he
recalled
having
followed
the
older
protocol
of
gallantry
rather
than
the
precedence
of
military
rank
xiv
the
reviewers
panned
hell
out
of
it
he
woke
with
a
guilty
start
and
looked
up
at
the
clock
on
the
ceiling
it
was
kicking
himself
free
of
the
covers
he
slid
his
feet
to
the
floor
and
sprinted
for
the
bathroom
while
he
was
fussing
to
get
the
shower
adjusted
to
the
right
temperature
he
bludgeoned
his
conscience
by
telling
himself
that
a
general
is
more
good
than
a
general
that
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
but
hope
that
hargreaves
patrols
would
keep
the
bomb
away
from
konkrook
until
pickering
came
up
with
one
of
their
own
and
that
the
fact
that
the
was
making
would
be
much
better
for
morale
than
the
spectacle
of
him
running
around
in
circles
he
shaved
carefully
a
stubble
of
beard
on
his
chin
might
betray
the
fact
that
he
was
worried
then
he
dressed
put
his
monocle
in
his
eye
and
called
the
headquarters
that
had
been
set
up
in
sid
harrington
now
his
office
a
girl
at
the
switchboard
appeared
on
his
screen
and
gave
place
to
paula
quinton
who
had
been
up
for
the
past
two
hours
the
got
in
about
three
hours
ago
general
she
told
him
she
had
four
of
king
yoorkerk
infantry
regiments
aboard
the
seventh
the
fourth
the
second
and
the
twelfth
they
the
rabble
i
ever
saw
but
hideyoshi
says
they
the
best
yoorkerk
has
and
they
all
have
rifles
general
broke
them
into
battalions
and
put
a
battalion
in
with
each
of
the
kragan
regiments
i
think
they
more
afraid
of
the
kragans
than
they
are
of
the
rebels
he
nodded
that
was
probably
the
best
way
to
employ
them
within
the
existing
situation
the
trouble
was
them
was
incurably
put
those
geeks
of
yoorkerk
in
with
the
kragans
and
they
be
most
useful
in
conquering
konkrook
but
the
trouble
was
that
after
associating
with
kragans
they
might
develop
into
reasonably
good
troops
themselves
to
the
undesired
improvement
of
king
yoorkerk
army
on
the
other
hand
maybe
not
keep
them
in
company
service
long
enough
and
they
might
want
to
forget
about
yoorkerk
and
stay
there
how
the
situation
over
in
town
he
asked
well
it
slowing
up
since
we
began
pulling
contragravity
out
she
told
him
but
the
geeks
are
breaking
up
rapidly
oh
there
was
something
funny
about
that
hassle
last
evening
when
the
came
in
two
contragravity
vehicles
an
aircar
and
an
that
went
out
to
meet
the
ship
are
unaccounted
for
you
mean
two
of
our
vehicles
are
missing
she
shook
her
head
frowning
in
perplexity
well
no
all
the
vehicles
that
answered
that
alert
returned
but
there
were
these
two
that
went
out
that
we
have
any
record
of
colonel
grinell
is
investigating
but
he
ca
find
out
anything
tell
him
not
to
waste
any
more
time
he
said
those
two
were
probably
geeks
from
konkrook
you
know
that
how
the
von
schlichten
family
got
out
of
germany
in
the
year
three
flew
a
bomber
to
spain
the
konkrook
are
getting
out
before
the
army
of
occupation
moves
in
well
the
posts
at
the
old
kragan
castles
report
some
contragravity
and
parties
riding
moving
west
from
the
city
she
told
him
there
are
a
lot
of
refugees
on
the
roads
and
combat
reports
from
konkrook
agree
that
resistance
is
getting
weaker
every
hour
and
the
they
beginning
to
call
her
the
is
up
a
hundred
and
fifty
miles
over
keegark
we
have
radar
and
vision
screens
and
telemetered
radiation
and
other
detectors
here
tuned
to
her
they
installing
a
similar
set
on
the
at
the
shipyard
by
the
way
hargreaves
wants
to
know
if
he
can
take
a
pair
of
rifles
from
the
channel
battery
and
mount
them
on
the
yes
of
course
he
can
have
anything
he
wants
as
long
as
it
urgently
needed
for
the
bomb
project
reports
normal
contragravity
traffic
between
keegark
and
the
around
aircars
lorries
a
few
scows
but
nothing
suspicious
no
trace
of
either
of
the
ships
kankad
people
are
building
receiving
sets
to
install
on
the
and
the
and
another
set
for
kankad
town
pickering
and
his
people
are
still
working
but
they
all
look
pretty
frustrated
they
have
major
thornton
at
the
ammunition
plant
doing
experimental
work
on
charges
to
bring
the
subcritical
masses
together
and
hold
them
together
till
an
explosion
can
be
produced
they
using
most
of
the
skilled
electrical
and
electronics
people
to
work
up
a
detonating
device
that
why
people
are
doing
most
of
the
work
hargreaves
is
fitting
a
lot
of
small
craft
and
civilian
aircars
with
radar
sets
to
use
for
patrolling
that
sounds
good
von
schlichten
said
i
be
around
and
see
how
things
are
after
i
had
some
breakfast
he
had
breakfast
at
the
main
cafeteria
four
floors
down
there
as
much
laughing
and
talking
as
usual
but
the
crowd
there
seemed
in
good
spirits
he
spent
some
time
at
headquarters
watching
keegark
by
tv
and
radar
so
far
nothing
had
been
done
about
direct
reconnaissance
over
keegark
with
but
hargreaves
reported
that
a
couple
of
privately
owned
aircars
were
being
fitted
for
the
job
he
made
a
flying
inspection
trip
around
the
island
and
visited
the
farms
south
of
the
city
on
the
mainland
and
finally
made
a
sweep
in
the
over
the
city
itself
reconnaissance
in
person
was
an
archaic
and
unprogressive
procedure
and
it
was
a
good
way
to
get
generals
killed
but
one
could
see
a
lot
of
things
that
would
be
missed
on
tv
he
let
down
several
times
in
areas
that
had
already
been
taken
and
talked
to
company
and
platoon
officers
for
one
thing
king
yoorkerk
flamboyantly
named
regiments
were
quite
as
bad
as
paula
had
thought
she
been
spoiled
by
the
kragans
in
her
appreciation
of
other
native
troops
they
had
good
arms
they
were
brave
and
capable
and
they
had
been
just
enough
insulted
by
being
integrated
into
kragan
regiments
to
try
to
make
a
good
showing
by
noon
resistance
in
the
city
was
beginning
to
cave
in
surrender
flags
were
appearing
on
one
after
another
of
the
konkrookan
rebel
and
at
after
he
had
returned
to
the
island
a
delegation
headed
by
the
konkrookan
equivalent
of
lord
mayor
and
composed
largely
of
prominent
merchants
came
across
the
channel
under
a
flag
of
truce
to
surrender
the
city
spear
of
state
with
abject
apologies
for
not
having
gurgurk
head
on
the
point
of
it
gurgurk
they
reported
had
fled
to
keegark
by
air
the
night
before
which
explained
the
incident
of
the
unaccountable
aircar
and
lorry
the
channel
battery
stopped
firing
and
with
the
exception
of
an
occasional
spatter
of
fire
the
city
fell
silent
at
von
schlichten
visited
the
headquarters
pickering
had
set
up
in
the
office
building
at
the
as
he
stepped
off
the
lift
on
the
third
floor
a
girl
running
down
the
hall
with
her
arms
full
of
papers
in
folders
collided
with
him
the
load
of
papers
flew
in
all
directions
he
stooped
to
help
her
pick
them
up
oh
general
is
it
wonderful
she
cried
i
just
ca
believe
it
is
what
wonderful
he
asked
oh
do
you
know
they
got
it
huh
they
have
he
gathered
up
the
last
of
the
big
envelopes
and
gave
them
to
her
when
just
half
an
hour
ago
and
to
think
those
books
were
around
here
all
the
time
and
oh
i
got
to
run
she
disappeared
into
the
lift
inside
the
office
one
of
pickering
engineers
was
sitting
on
the
middle
of
his
spinal
column
a
in
one
hand
and
a
book
in
the
other
once
in
a
while
he
would
say
something
into
the
mouthpiece
of
the
phone
two
other
nuclear
engineers
had
similar
books
spread
out
on
a
desk
in
front
of
them
they
were
making
notes
and
looking
up
references
in
the
engineers
and
making
calculations
with
their
sliderules
there
was
a
huddle
around
the
where
two
more
such
books
were
in
use
well
what
happened
he
demanded
catching
pickering
by
the
arm
as
he
rushed
from
one
group
to
another
ha
we
have
it
pickering
cried
everything
we
need
look
he
had
another
of
the
books
under
his
arm
he
held
it
out
to
von
schlichten
and
von
schlichten
suddenly
felt
sicker
than
he
had
ever
felt
since
at
the
age
of
fourteen
he
had
gotten
drunk
for
the
first
time
he
had
seen
men
crack
up
under
intolerable
strain
before
but
this
was
the
first
time
he
had
seen
a
whole
roomful
of
men
blow
their
tops
in
the
same
manner
the
book
was
a
novel
a
historical
novel
of
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
pages
its
bore
a
picture
of
a
young
lady
with
crimson
hair
and
green
eyes
and
jade
earrings
and
a
plunging
not
to
say
neckline
that
left
her
affiliation
with
the
class
of
mammalia
in
no
doubt
whatever
in
the
background
a
rose
and
away
from
it
something
intended
to
be
a
bomber
of
the
first
century
was
racing
madly
the
title
he
saw
was
and
the
author
was
one
hildegarde
hernandez
well
it
has
a
picture
of
an
explosion
on
it
he
agreed
it
has
more
than
that
it
has
the
whole
business
case
specifications
tampers
charge
design
detonating
device
everything
why
the
even
have
diagrams
copies
of
the
original
drawings
look
von
schlichten
looked
he
had
no
more
than
the
average
intelligent
layman
knowledge
of
nuclear
physics
enough
to
recharge
or
repair
a
but
the
drawings
looked
authentic
enough
they
seemed
to
be
copies
of
ancient
blueprints
lettered
in
first
century
english
with
lingua
terra
translations
added
and
marked
top
secret
and
army
corps
of
engineers
and
manhattan
engineering
district
and
look
at
this
pickering
opened
at
a
marked
page
and
showed
it
to
him
and
this
he
opened
where
another
slip
of
paper
had
been
inserted
everything
we
want
to
know
practically
i
do
get
this
he
was
sick
anymore
just
bewildered
i
read
some
reviews
of
this
thing
all
the
reviewers
panned
hell
out
of
it
war
ii
through
a
bedroom
keyhole
in
black
lace
panties
that
sort
of
thing
yeh
yeh
sure
pickering
agreed
but
this
hernandez
had
illusions
of
being
a
great
serious
historical
novelist
see
she
wo
try
to
write
a
book
till
she
put
in
years
of
research
actually
about
six
months
research
by
a
herd
of
librarians
and
and
other
such
literary
coolies
and
she
boasts
that
she
never
yet
has
been
caught
in
an
error
of
historical
background
detail
well
this
opus
is
about
the
old
manhattan
project
the
heroine
is
a
sort
of
who
is
alternately
and
sometimes
simultaneously
in
the
pay
of
the
nazis
the
soviets
the
vatican
chiang
the
japanese
emperor
and
the
jewish
international
bankers
and
she
sleeps
with
everybody
but
joe
stalin
and
mao
and
of
course
she
is
in
on
every
step
of
the
project
she
even
manages
to
stow
away
on
the
with
the
help
of
a
general
she
spent
fifty
incandescent
pages
seducing
in
order
to
tool
up
for
this
la
hernandez
did
her
researching
just
where
lourenço
gomes
probably
did
his
university
of
montevideo
library
she
even
had
access
to
the
photostats
of
the
old
data
that
general
lanningham
brought
to
south
america
after
the
debacle
in
the
united
states
in
those
are
part
of
the
lanningham
stuff
as
far
as
we
been
able
to
check
mathematically
everything
is
strictly
authentic
and
practical
have
to
run
a
few
more
tests
on
the
charges
we
do
have
any
data
on
the
exact
strength
of
the
explosives
they
used
then
and
the
tampers
and
detonating
device
will
need
to
be
tested
a
little
but
in
about
half
an
hour
we
ought
to
be
able
to
start
drawing
plans
for
the
case
and
as
soon
as
they
finished
rush
them
to
the
shipyard
foundries
for
casting
von
schlichten
handed
the
book
back
to
pickering
and
sighed
deeply
and
i
thought
everybody
here
had
gone
off
his
rocker
he
said
we
will
erect
on
the
ruins
of
keegark
a
statue
of
señorita
hildegarde
hernandez
how
did
you
get
onto
this
pickering
pointed
to
a
young
man
with
dull
brick
colored
hair
who
was
punching
out
some
kind
of
a
problem
on
a
small
computing
machine
piet
van
reenen
over
there
he
has
a
whose
taste
runs
to
this
sort
of
literary
she
told
him
it
was
all
in
a
book
she
just
read
and
showed
him
we
descended
in
force
on
the
bookshop
and
grabbed
every
copy
in
stock
we
are
now
running
a
sort
of
process
to
separate
the
nuclear
physics
from
the
pornography
i
must
say
hildegarde
has
her
biological
data
very
well
in
hand
too
i
bet
she
have
fun
writing
a
novel
about
these
geeks
von
schlichten
said
well
how
soon
do
you
think
you
can
have
a
bomb
ready
for
us
casting
the
cases
is
going
to
slow
us
down
the
most
pickering
said
but
even
with
that
we
ought
to
have
one
ready
in
three
days
at
the
most
by
two
weeks
we
be
turning
them
out
on
an
i
hope
we
do
need
more
than
one
but
you
better
produce
at
least
half
a
dozen
and
have
some
made
up
out
of
concrete
or
anything
as
long
as
they
the
right
weight
and
airfoil
and
have
some
way
of
releasing
smoke
get
them
done
as
soon
as
you
have
your
case
designed
we
want
to
be
able
to
make
a
couple
of
practice
drops
there
was
no
use
he
thought
of
raising
hopes
which
might
prove
premature
he
told
paula
quinton
of
course
and
themistocles
and
by
telecast
on
sealed
beam
king
kankad
and
hargreaves
beyond
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
and
hope
that
hargreaves
could
keep
orgzild
bombers
away
from
gongonk
island
and
kankad
town
and
that
hildegarde
hernandez
had
been
playing
fair
with
her
public
he
visited
the
city
where
a
few
pockets
of
diehard
resistance
were
being
liquidated
and
where
everybody
who
had
not
been
too
deeply
and
publicly
involved
in
the
conspiracy
was
now
coming
forward
and
claiming
to
have
been
a
lifelong
friend
of
the
terrans
and
the
company
von
schlichten
returned
to
gongonk
island
debating
with
himself
whether
to
declare
a
general
amnesty
or
to
set
up
a
dozen
guillotines
in
the
city
and
run
them
around
the
clock
for
a
week
there
were
cogent
arguments
for
and
against
either
procedure
by
the
last
organized
resistance
had
been
wiped
out
and
curfew
had
been
imposed
and
peace
of
a
sort
restored
there
was
still
the
threat
from
keegark
but
it
was
looking
less
ominous
now
than
it
had
the
evening
before
von
schlichten
and
paula
were
having
dinner
in
the
broadway
room
confident
that
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
that
they
could
do
anything
about
when
the
extension
phone
that
had
been
plugged
in
at
their
table
rang
colonel
quinton
here
paula
identified
herself
into
it
and
listened
for
a
moment
there
has
when
well
where
did
it
come
from
i
see
and
the
direction
anything
else
apparently
there
was
nothing
else
she
hung
up
and
turned
to
von
schlichten
the
just
detected
a
ship
lifting
out
from
keegark
presumed
one
of
the
freighters
either
the
or
the
paul
it
was
first
picked
up
on
contragravity
at
about
a
hundred
feet
rising
vertically
from
near
the
palace
the
supposition
is
the
geeks
had
her
camouflaged
since
the
time
commander
prinsloo
first
bombarded
keegark
with
the
that
was
about
twenty
minutes
ago
at
last
report
she
fifty
miles
north
of
keegark
headed
up
the
hoork
river
von
schlichten
started
thinking
aloud
that
could
be
a
feint
to
draw
our
ships
north
after
her
and
leave
the
approach
to
konkrook
or
kankad
open
but
that
would
be
presuming
that
they
know
about
the
and
i
doubt
that
though
not
enough
to
take
chances
on
they
know
we
have
ground
and
and
they
may
think
they
can
slip
down
the
konk
valley
either
undetected
or
mistaken
for
one
of
our
ships
from
north
uller
he
picked
up
the
phone
get
me
through
on
telecast
to
hargreaves
aboard
the
he
said
i
take
it
in
the
office
i
be
up
directly
he
rose
finish
your
dinner
and
have
the
rest
of
mine
sent
up
he
told
paula
leaving
the
elevator
he
rushed
into
the
big
headquarters
room
just
as
contact
was
established
with
the
on
station
over
the
northwestern
corner
of
takkad
sea
between
kankad
town
and
keegark
the
he
knew
was
west
of
keegark
the
now
fitted
with
a
pair
of
guns
in
addition
to
her
had
just
arrived
at
kankad
he
had
the
sent
north
along
the
crest
of
the
between
the
hoork
and
konk
where
she
could
cover
both
with
her
own
radar
and
other
and
exchange
information
with
the
and
the
sent
in
what
looked
like
the
right
course
to
intercept
the
freighter
from
keegark
the
also
with
screens
tuned
to
the
was
sent
to
take
over
the
regular
station
finally
he
called
skilk
and
had
the
sent
south
down
the
hoork
valley
after
that
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
and
watch
the
screens
paula
quinton
put
in
an
appearance
shortly
after
he
had
finished
calling
skilk
pushing
a
on
which
their
interrupted
dinners
had
been
placed
they
finished
eating
and
drank
coffee
and
smoked
most
of
the
rest
of
his
staff
who
were
not
busy
on
the
or
at
the
shipyards
or
with
the
occupation
of
konkrook
drifted
in
they
all
sat
and
stared
from
one
to
another
of
the
screens
which
told
in
and
direct
vision
and
telescopic
vision
and
heat
and
radiation
detection
the
story
of
what
was
going
on
to
the
northeast
of
them
keegark
was
dark
on
the
evidently
king
orgzild
had
invented
the
blackout
too
not
that
it
did
him
any
good
the
showed
the
city
clearly
and
it
was
just
as
clear
on
the
radiation
and
the
keegarkan
ship
was
completely
blacked
out
but
the
radiations
from
her
engines
and
the
distinctive
of
her
showed
clearly
and
there
was
a
speck
that
marked
her
position
on
the
the
same
position
was
marked
with
a
of
light
on
the
some
device
on
the
synchronized
with
the
detectors
kept
it
focused
there
the
company
ships
and
contragravity
vehicles
all
were
carrying
topside
lights
visible
only
from
above
which
flashed
alternate
red
and
blue
to
identify
them
time
crawled
slowly
around
the
on
the
wall
the
minutes
of
uller
dragging
like
hours
the
spots
that
marked
the
enemy
ship
and
her
hunters
crawled
too
seen
from
the
altitude
of
the
even
the
speed
of
the
was
barely
visible
they
drank
coffee
till
the
stuff
revolted
them
they
smoked
until
their
throats
and
mouths
were
dry
they
watched
the
screens
until
they
thought
that
they
would
see
them
in
their
dreams
forever
then
the
reported
with
the
keegarkan
ship
which
had
begun
to
turn
in
a
course
and
was
coming
south
down
the
konk
valley
after
that
the
began
reporting
directly
and
her
topside
went
out
doused
our
lights
we
down
in
the
valley
altitude
about
a
thousand
feet
we
trying
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
against
the
sky
a
voice
came
in
we
cutting
in
our
forward
the
voice
repeated
several
times
the
wavelength
and
somebody
got
an
auxiliary
screen
tuned
in
there
was
nothing
visible
on
it
but
the
darkness
of
the
valley
the
sky
and
the
loom
of
the
east
konk
mountains
we
still
ca
see
her
but
we
ought
to
any
moment
radar
shows
her
well
above
the
mountains
ah
there
she
is
she
just
obscured
beta
hydrae
v
she
moving
toward
that
big
constellation
to
the
east
of
it
the
one
they
call
finnegan
goat
now
she
be
right
in
the
center
of
the
screen
we
going
straight
for
her
we
going
to
try
to
slow
her
down
till
the
can
get
here
the
enemy
ship
was
vaguely
visible
now
becoming
clearer
in
the
starlight
she
was
a
freighter
all
right
probably
the
the
paul
had
last
been
reported
at
bwork
and
there
was
little
chance
that
she
had
slipped
into
keegark
since
the
uprising
had
started
for
all
anybody
knew
she
could
have
been
destroyed
in
the
fighting
before
the
bwork
residency
fell
all
right
we
have
her
spotted
we
going
to
open
up
on
her
the
voice
from
the
announced
she
has
two
to
our
one
try
to
disable
them
first
the
lit
with
the
indirect
glare
of
the
and
the
image
in
it
jiggled
violently
as
the
ship
shook
to
the
recoil
then
steadied
again
with
the
enemy
ship
visible
in
the
middle
of
it
growing
larger
and
larger
as
the
rushed
toward
her
the
gun
fired
again
and
again
flooding
the
screen
with
momentary
yellow
light
and
disturbing
the
image
as
the
recoil
shook
the
the
enemy
ship
began
firing
in
reply
the
shots
were
all
wide
misses
apparently
the
geek
guncrew
did
know
how
to
synchronize
the
radar
sights
and
were
ignorant
of
the
correct
setting
for
the
the
searchlights
came
on
bathing
her
quarry
in
light
it
was
the
the
name
and
the
of
the
old
were
plainly
visible
her
forward
gun
had
been
knocked
out
and
she
was
trying
to
swing
about
to
get
a
field
of
fire
for
her
we
going
to
give
her
a
the
voice
said
watch
this
now
the
rockets
leaped
forward
from
the
topside
racks
four
and
four
and
four
and
four
at
intervals
the
first
four
hit
the
amidships
and
low
exploding
with
a
flare
that
grew
before
it
could
die
away
as
the
second
four
landed
nobody
ever
saw
the
third
and
fourth
four
land
the
vanished
in
a
blaze
of
light
that
blinded
everybody
in
the
room
when
they
could
see
again
after
some
thirty
seconds
the
screen
was
dark
in
the
screen
from
the
the
whole
countryside
of
the
konk
valley
five
hundred
miles
north
of
konkrook
was
lighted
the
heat
and
radiation
detectors
were
going
insane
and
in
the
shifting
confusion
on
the
there
was
no
trace
either
of
the
or
the
well
the
geeks
did
have
an
themistocles
said
at
length
i
been
trying
to
kid
myself
that
we
were
just
preparing
against
a
chance
i
wonder
how
many
more
they
have
paula
find
out
who
was
in
command
of
the
he
be
a
lieutenant
fix
up
orders
promoting
him
to
navy
captain
as
of
now
it
probably
the
only
thing
we
can
do
for
him
anymore
and
promotions
of
the
same
order
for
everybody
else
aboard
that
cutter
authority
carlos
von
schlichten
acting
he
picked
up
a
phone
get
me
commander
prinsloo
on
he
ordered
prinsloo
to
launch
airboats
and
make
a
search
cautioned
him
to
be
careful
of
radiation
but
to
take
no
chances
on
any
of
the
complement
being
still
alive
and
in
need
of
help
while
that
was
going
on
the
reported
another
ship
coming
over
her
horizon
to
the
east
from
the
direction
of
bwork
that
would
be
the
paul
hargreaves
had
already
learned
of
the
advent
of
the
second
freighter
he
was
unwilling
to
take
the
off
her
station
until
the
returned
from
the
konk
valley
in
this
von
schlichten
concurred
somebody
suggested
that
a
drink
would
be
in
order
they
had
just
watched
the
death
of
three
terran
officers
fifteen
terran
airmen
and
ten
kragans
but
they
had
all
been
living
in
too
close
companionship
with
death
in
the
past
three
days
or
was
it
three
centuries
to
be
too
deeply
affected
and
they
had
also
watched
at
least
for
a
day
or
so
the
removal
of
the
threat
that
had
hung
over
their
heads
and
they
had
seen
proof
that
they
had
a
defense
against
king
orgzild
bombs
they
were
still
mixing
cocktails
when
pickering
phoned
in
some
good
news
general
from
operation
we
ought
to
have
at
least
one
bomb
ready
to
drop
by
tomorrow
four
or
five
more
by
next
midnight
he
said
we
do
need
to
have
cases
cast
we
got
our
dimensions
decided
and
we
find
that
there
are
a
lot
of
big
empty
flasks
or
tanks
rather
at
the
spaceport
that
accommodate
everything
fissionables
tampers
detonator
and
all
well
go
ahead
with
it
make
up
a
few
of
them
as
many
as
you
can
between
now
and
sunday
he
thought
for
a
moment
do
waste
time
on
those
practice
bombs
i
mentioned
we
make
a
practice
drop
with
a
live
bomb
and
do
throw
away
the
design
for
the
cast
case
we
may
need
that
later
on
xv
a
place
in
my
heart
for
hildegarde
the
company
fleet
hung
off
keegark
at
fifteen
thousand
feet
in
a
belt
of
calm
air
just
below
the
seesawing
currents
from
the
warming
antarctic
and
the
cooling
deserts
of
the
arctic
there
was
the
from
the
bridge
of
which
von
schlichten
watched
the
movements
of
the
other
ships
and
airboats
and
the
distant
horizon
the
was
ten
miles
off
to
the
west
her
metal
sheathing
glinting
in
the
red
light
of
the
evening
sun
there
was
the
down
from
skilk
a
smaller
and
more
distant
twinkle
of
reflected
light
to
the
north
of
the
was
off
to
the
east
and
between
her
and
was
a
fifth
ship
turning
the
binoculars
around
he
could
just
make
out
on
her
bow
the
figurehead
bust
of
a
man
in
an
ancient
tophat
and
a
fringe
of
she
was
the
paul
captured
by
the
after
a
chase
across
the
mountains
northeast
of
keegark
the
day
before
and
remote
from
the
other
ships
to
the
south
a
tiny
speck
of
almost
invisible
against
the
sky
and
a
smaller
twinkle
of
reflected
sunlight
a
unflatteringly
but
somewhat
aptly
rechristened
which
had
been
altered
as
a
and
the
with
the
glasses
he
could
see
a
bulky
cylinder
being
handled
off
the
scow
and
loaded
onto
the
improvised
on
the
stern
shortly
thereafter
the
broke
loose
from
the
tender
and
began
to
approach
the
fleet
general
i
must
protest
against
your
doing
this
hargreaves
said
there
simply
no
sense
in
it
that
bomb
can
be
dropped
without
your
personal
supervision
aboard
sir
and
endangering
yourself
unnecessarily
that
infernal
machine
has
been
tested
or
anything
it
might
even
let
go
on
the
catapult
when
you
try
to
drop
it
and
we
simply
ca
afford
to
lose
you
now
no
what
would
become
of
us
if
you
go
out
there
and
blow
yourself
up
with
that
contraption
buhrmann
supported
him
my
god
i
thought
don
quixote
was
a
spaniard
instead
of
a
german
argentino
von
schlichten
corrected
and
do
try
to
sell
me
that
irreplaceable
man
line
either
them
can
replace
me
hid
can
replace
him
barney
mordkovitz
can
replace
him
and
so
on
down
to
where
you
make
a
second
lieutenant
out
of
some
sergeant
been
all
over
this
last
evening
admitted
we
ca
take
time
for
a
long
string
of
and
admitted
we
have
to
use
an
untested
weapon
i
not
sending
men
out
under
those
circumstances
and
staying
here
on
this
ship
and
watch
them
blow
themselves
up
if
that
our
only
hope
it
got
to
be
dropped
right
and
i
not
going
to
take
a
chance
on
having
it
dropped
by
a
crew
who
think
they
been
sent
out
on
a
suicide
mission
what
happened
to
the
when
she
blew
the
up
is
too
fresh
in
everybody
mind
but
if
i
who
ordered
the
mission
accompany
it
they
know
i
have
some
confidence
that
they
come
back
alive
well
i
coming
along
too
general
kent
pickering
spoke
up
i
made
the
damned
thing
and
i
ought
to
be
along
when
it
dropped
on
the
principle
that
a
ought
to
be
seen
eating
his
own
food
once
in
a
while
i
still
do
see
why
we
could
have
made
at
least
one
test
shot
first
hans
meyerstein
the
banking
cartel
man
objected
well
i
tell
you
why
paula
quinton
spoke
up
there
a
good
chance
that
the
geeks
do
know
we
have
a
bomb
of
our
own
they
may
believe
that
it
was
something
invented
on
niflheim
for
mining
purposes
and
that
we
have
realized
its
military
application
there
more
than
a
good
chance
that
the
loss
of
the
has
temporarily
demoralized
them
personally
i
believe
that
both
king
orgzild
and
prince
gorkrink
were
aboard
her
when
she
blew
up
something
we
never
know
positively
of
course
that
ship
and
everything
and
everybody
in
her
were
simply
vaporized
and
the
particles
are
registering
on
our
geigers
now
but
i
as
sure
as
i
am
of
anything
about
these
geeks
that
one
or
both
of
them
accompanied
her
paula
knows
what
she
talking
about
king
kankad
jabbered
in
the
takkad
sea
language
which
they
all
understood
just
like
von
saying
that
he
has
to
go
on
our
cutter
to
encourage
the
crew
they
always
insist
that
their
kings
and
generals
go
into
battle
particularly
if
something
important
is
to
be
done
they
think
the
gods
get
angry
if
they
do
and
we
have
to
hit
them
now
von
schlichten
said
they
still
have
a
couple
of
bombs
left
we
have
been
able
to
locate
them
with
detectors
but
those
geeks
kankad
men
caught
on
that
last
night
say
that
there
were
at
least
three
of
them
made
we
take
a
chance
that
some
fanatic
may
load
one
into
an
aircar
and
make
a
on
gongonk
island
the
ran
alongside
with
her
figurehead
and
the
black
cylinder
on
her
catapult
aft
somebody
had
painted
on
the
bomb
dire
dawn
hildegarde
hernandez
compliments
of
the
author
to
king
orgzild
of
a
gangway
was
run
out
to
connect
the
ship
with
the
cutter
von
schlichten
and
kent
pickering
went
down
the
ladder
from
the
bridge
the
others
accompanying
them
as
he
stepped
into
the
gangway
paula
quinton
fell
in
behind
him
where
do
you
think
you
going
he
demanded
along
with
you
she
replied
i
your
adjutant
i
believe
you
definitely
are
not
going
along
personally
i
do
believe
there
any
danger
but
i
not
having
you
run
any
unnecessary
risks
von
i
do
know
much
about
the
way
terrans
think
except
about
fighting
and
about
making
things
kankad
told
him
and
i
do
know
anything
at
all
about
the
kind
of
terrans
who
have
young
but
i
believe
this
is
something
important
to
paula
let
her
go
with
you
because
if
you
go
alone
and
do
come
back
i
do
think
she
will
ever
be
happy
again
he
looked
at
kankad
curiously
wondering
as
he
had
so
often
before
just
what
went
on
inside
that
then
he
looked
at
paula
and
after
a
moment
he
nodded
all
right
colonel
objection
withdrawn
he
said
aboard
the
they
gave
the
bomb
a
inspection
and
checked
the
catapult
and
the
and
then
went
up
on
the
bridge
ready
for
the
bombing
mission
sir
the
skipper
a
lieutenant
morrison
asked
ready
if
you
are
lieutenant
carry
on
we
just
passengers
thank
you
sir
we
thought
of
going
in
over
the
city
at
about
five
thousand
for
a
turning
when
we
back
to
the
mountains
and
coming
back
for
our
at
fifteen
thousand
is
that
all
right
sir
von
schlichten
nodded
you
the
skipper
lieutenant
you
better
make
sure
though
that
as
soon
as
the
signal
is
flashed
your
engineer
hits
his
auxiliary
button
we
want
to
be
about
fifteen
miles
from
where
that
thing
goes
off
the
lieutenant
muttered
something
that
sounded
unmilitarily
like
you
ai
foolin
brother
no
i
not
von
schlichten
agreed
i
saw
the
on
the
the
pointed
her
bow
and
the
long
blade
of
the
figurehead
warrior
spear
toward
keegark
the
city
grew
out
of
the
a
particolored
blur
at
the
delta
of
the
dry
hoork
river
and
then
a
triangle
between
the
river
and
the
bay
and
the
hills
on
the
landward
side
and
then
it
took
shape
with
streets
and
granulated
with
buildings
as
they
came
in
von
schlichten
who
had
approached
it
from
the
air
many
times
before
could
distinguish
the
landmarks
the
site
of
king
orgzild
nitroglycerin
plant
now
a
crater
surrounded
by
a
radius
of
ruins
the
residency
another
crater
since
rodolfo
mackinnon
had
blown
it
up
under
him
the
smashed
de
at
the
company
docks
king
palace
and
with
a
hole
blown
in
one
corner
by
the
bombs
then
they
were
past
the
city
and
over
open
country
i
wish
we
had
some
idea
where
the
rest
of
those
bombs
are
stored
sir
lieutenant
morrison
said
we
do
seem
to
have
gotten
anything
significant
when
we
flew
reconnaissance
with
the
radiation
detectors
no
about
all
that
was
picked
up
was
the
main
and
the
from
there
was
normal
pickering
agreed
the
bombs
themselves
would
be
detectable
except
to
the
extent
that
say
a
engine
for
an
airboat
would
be
they
probably
have
them
underground
somewhere
well
shielded
those
prisoners
kankad
commandos
dragged
in
only
knew
that
they
were
in
the
city
somewhere
von
schlichten
considered
how
about
midway
between
the
palace
and
the
residency
for
our
lieutenant
that
looks
like
the
center
of
the
city
the
cutter
turned
and
started
back
having
risen
another
ten
thousand
feet
morrison
passed
the
word
to
the
bombardier
the
city
with
the
sea
beyond
it
now
came
rushing
at
them
and
von
schlichten
standing
at
the
front
of
the
bridge
discovered
that
he
had
his
arm
around
paula
waist
and
was
holding
her
a
little
more
closely
than
was
military
he
made
no
attempt
to
release
her
however
there
nothing
to
worry
about
really
he
was
assuring
her
pickering
boys
built
this
thing
according
to
the
best
principles
of
engineering
and
the
stuff
they
got
out
of
that
all
checked
mathematically
the
red
light
on
the
bridge
flashed
and
the
intercom
shouted
off
he
forced
paula
down
on
the
bridge
deck
and
crouched
beside
her
cover
your
eyes
he
warned
you
remember
what
the
flash
was
like
in
the
screen
when
the
blew
up
and
we
did
get
the
worst
of
it
the
pickup
on
the
was
knocked
out
too
soon
he
kept
on
lecturing
her
about
and
rays
and
and
cosmic
rays
trying
to
keep
making
some
sort
of
intelligent
sounds
while
they
clung
together
and
waited
and
with
the
other
half
of
his
mind
trying
not
to
think
of
everything
that
could
go
wrong
with
that
improvisation
they
had
just
dumped
onto
keegark
if
it
did
blow
and
the
geeks
found
it
they
know
that
another
one
would
be
along
shortly
and
an
invisible
hand
caught
the
and
hurled
her
sending
von
schlichten
and
paula
sprawling
at
full
length
on
the
deck
still
clinging
to
one
another
there
was
a
blast
of
almost
palpable
sound
and
a
sensation
of
heat
that
penetrated
even
the
airtight
superstructure
of
the
an
instant
later
there
was
another
and
another
similar
shock
two
more
bombs
had
gone
off
behind
them
in
keegark
that
meant
that
they
had
found
king
orgzild
remaining
nuclear
armament
there
were
shattering
sounds
of
breaking
glass
and
heavy
thumps
that
told
of
structural
damage
to
the
cutter
and
hoarse
shouts
and
lurid
cursing
as
morrison
and
his
airmen
struggled
with
the
controls
the
cutter
began
losing
altitude
but
she
was
back
on
a
reasonably
even
keel
von
schlichten
rose
helping
paula
to
her
feet
and
found
that
they
had
been
kissing
one
another
passionately
they
were
still
in
each
other
arms
when
the
pitching
and
rolling
of
the
cutter
ceased
and
somebody
tapped
him
on
the
shoulder
he
came
out
of
the
embrace
and
looked
around
it
was
lieutenant
morrison
what
the
devil
lieutenant
he
demanded
sorry
to
interrupt
sir
but
we
starting
back
to
and
here
you
want
this
i
suppose
he
held
out
a
glass
disc
i
never
expected
to
see
it
but
at
that
it
took
three
to
blow
you
loose
from
your
monocle
oh
that
von
schlichten
took
his
trademark
and
set
it
in
his
eye
i
did
lose
it
he
lied
i
just
jettisoned
it
do
you
know
lieutenant
that
no
gentleman
ever
wears
a
monocle
while
he
kissing
a
lady
he
looked
around
they
were
at
about
eight
hundred
to
a
thousand
feet
above
the
water
with
a
stiff
following
wind
away
from
the
explosion
area
the
gun
forward
must
have
been
knocked
loose
and
carried
away
it
was
gone
and
so
was
the
and
the
radar
something
probably
the
gun
had
slammed
against
the
front
of
the
bridge
the
metal
skeleton
was
bent
in
and
the
had
been
knocked
out
the
cutter
was
vibrating
properly
so
the
had
not
been
disturbed
and
her
jets
were
firing
it
was
the
second
and
third
bombs
that
did
the
damage
sir
morrison
was
saying
we
have
gone
through
the
effects
of
our
own
bomb
with
nothing
more
than
a
bad
shaking
of
course
on
contragravity
weightless
relative
to
the
but
she
was
built
to
stand
the
winds
in
the
high
latitudes
but
the
two
geek
bombs
caught
us
off
balance
you
do
need
to
apologize
lieutenant
you
and
your
crew
behaved
splendidly
best
traditions
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
it
was
a
pleasure
commander
hope
to
be
aboard
with
you
again
captain
they
found
kent
pickering
at
the
rear
of
the
bridge
and
joined
him
looking
astern
even
von
schlichten
who
had
seen
and
bombs
was
impressed
keegark
was
completely
obliterated
under
an
cloud
of
smoke
and
dust
that
spread
out
for
five
miles
at
the
bottom
of
the
towering
column
there
had
been
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
people
in
that
city
even
if
their
faces
were
the
faces
of
lizards
and
they
had
four
arms
and
skins
what
fraction
of
them
were
now
alive
he
could
not
guess
he
had
to
remind
himself
that
they
were
the
people
who
had
burned
eric
blount
and
hendrik
lemoyne
alive
that
two
of
the
three
bombs
that
had
contributed
to
that
column
of
boiling
smoke
had
been
made
in
keegark
by
keegarkans
and
that
with
a
few
causal
factors
altered
he
was
seeing
what
would
have
happened
to
konkrook
perhaps
every
terran
felt
a
superstitious
dread
of
nuclear
energy
turned
to
the
purposes
of
war
small
wonder
after
what
they
had
done
on
their
own
world
for
one
thing
he
thought
grimly
the
next
geek
who
picks
up
the
idea
of
soaking
a
terran
in
thermoconcentrate
and
setting
fire
to
him
will
drop
it
again
like
a
hot
potato
and
the
next
geek
potentate
who
tries
to
organize
an
conspiracy
or
the
next
crazy
who
preached
will
be
lynched
on
the
spot
but
this
must
be
the
last
nuclear
bomb
used
on
uller
drunkard
resolution
he
told
himself
contemptuously
the
next
time
it
will
come
easier
and
easier
still
the
time
after
that
after
you
drop
the
first
bomb
there
is
no
turning
back
any
more
than
there
had
been
after
hiroshima
years
ago
why
he
had
even
been
considering
just
where
against
the
mountains
back
of
bwork
he
would
drop
a
demonstration
bomb
as
a
prelude
to
a
surrender
demand
you
either
went
on
to
the
inevitable
catastrophe
or
you
realized
in
time
that
nuclear
armament
and
nationalism
can
not
exist
together
on
the
same
planet
and
it
is
easier
to
banish
a
habit
of
thought
than
a
piece
of
knowledge
uller
was
not
ready
for
membership
in
the
terran
federation
then
its
people
must
bow
to
the
terran
pax
the
kragans
would
help
as
proconsuls
administrators
now
instead
of
mercenaries
and
there
must
be
manned
orbital
stations
and
the
residencies
must
be
moved
outside
the
cities
away
from
possible
and
sid
harrington
idea
of
encouraging
the
natives
to
own
their
own
must
be
shelved
for
a
long
time
to
come
maybe
in
a
century
or
so
kankad
had
a
good
idea
at
that
a
most
meritorious
idea
he
was
sold
on
it
already
and
he
doubted
if
it
would
take
much
salesmanship
with
paula
either
already
she
was
clinging
to
his
arm
with
obvious
possessiveness
maybe
their
grandchildren
and
the
kankad
of
that
time
would
see
uller
a
civilized
member
of
the
federation
they
paused
as
the
nuzzled
up
to
the
and
the
gangway
was
run
out
and
made
fast
looking
back
at
the
fearful
thing
that
had
sprouted
from
where
keegark
had
been
you
know
paula
was
saying
echoing
his
earlier
thought
but
for
that
female
pornographer
that
would
have
been
konkrook
he
nodded
yes
i
hope
you
wo
mind
but
there
will
always
be
a
place
in
my
heart
for
hildegarde
then
they
turned
their
backs
upon
the
abomination
of
desolation
and
went
up
the
gangway
together
looking
very
little
like
a
general
and
his
adjutant
with
a
broadsword
in
his
hand
von
schlichten
fought
his
way
toward
the
throne
there
firkked
waited
a
sword
in
one
of
his
upper
hands
his
spear
of
state
in
the
other
and
a
dagger
in
each
lower
hand
von
schlichten
fought
on
trying
not
to
think
of
the
absurdity
of
a
man
of
the
sixth
century
the
representative
of
a
civilized
chartered
company
dueling
to
the
death
with
a
barbarian
king
for
a
throne
he
had
promised
to
another
barbarian
or
of
what
could
happen
on
uller
if
he
allowed
this
monstrosity
to
kill
him

so
the

begins
with
the

a

and
a
seemingly
incidental
street
riot
only
when
a
dose

lands
in

it
become
clear
that
the

have
had
it
up
to
their

with

then
overnight

how

is

shrewd

to
know
that
it
is
